<h3 id="c6">國際變局的教訓 <a href="#c6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>一九三一年的「九一八是事變，是世運由光明轉趨黑暗的一個信號。自此以後，國際政局即一天天向着惡化方面發展”此事的演變，不准不能與世人所共同期望者相符合，即是適得其反，幾乎每一幕結局，都增加了人類的苦悶；而最近法國的屈服，更是東人心魄的一幕。此人其母以目前的情況爲元突，要知道踏入悲劇時代，到現在已是將近十年了！</p>
<p>其實，在這十年當中，並不是沒有光明因素由存在而滋長，也不是沒有與反動趨勢相對抗的勢力，漸次建設。卽以最近情勢而言，歐局雖陷於非常混亂的逆境，而遠東方面，則中國的抗戰更見光輝萬丈，屹然爲反侵略戰鬥的主流；又如美國，其種種運用，亦日益趨於積極和明確，與國際侵略勢力成正比例而發展。但這種種因素，自始未能戢止黑暗趨勢的擴展，也未能防範國際局勢的惡化。這並　一定由於實力的欠缺或運用的不足；　玫主要，不能不歸咎於國際間某一些人士認識噯昧，遂至貽誤事機；甚或貪圖近利，為虎謀皮，以致什代表着正義和公道的一方面，即有賢明睿智的措施，亦難收穫預期的效果；這使迷信暴力者流，反得以伺隙蹈瑕，償其貪慾。這種至足痛心的事例，從一九三一年到現現在，可以找到無數例證：其間尤以所謂現實主義政策所造成的惡果，更屬昭昭在人耳目，終至釀成歐陸的種種慘變。演化到了現在，歐洲若干大小國家己遭摧毀，此人信念和理智也受到强烈打擊；但事實的教訓，似乎尚未充分發揮震聲發瞶的效果；亦即已往那些政治錯誤，旣未知加以澈底淸除、甚至什若干重大問題上遠未免蹈襲着已往的覆轍。有如最近羅斯福總統關於應付歐局的措施，增强政府機構的運用，依然小免為那些聚訟盈庭的迂闊政客所困擾。又如連日頻傳，英法應付遠東所採取的途徑，又儼然是前此現實主義政策的繼續。從歐洲到遠東，從最初到現在生死存亡的最後關頭，若干人對於當前局勢的認識依然不能與實際的迫切任務知配合，這是一件深足遺憾的事。</p>
<p>關於美國情形。深信目前的困擾祇是目前的現象，深信彼國不乏明達之士，當此艱危之秋，絕不會被一部分鄉曲之見貽誤國家前途。我們所願簡單申說的，即此人務須切實體認此度法國失敗的經騐；民主政治是一種値得頌贊的制度，但却不能離開國家的整個命運而單獨存在。美法同為民主政治的主要策源地，但法國那種過於分權的政制，無數黨派的紛爭，却形成妨害團結，窒礙振奮的致命傷。此度敗衂之後，這一政制殆將隨法國已往的光輝同告沉淪。這是個創深痛鉅的當前教訓，應該給予美國人士以良好的借鑑。有人說：以羅斯福總統那樣才略和抱負，如果不是扼於美國政制的限制，則不僅其個人成就不可限量，整個世界亦將深受其惠。這是在事實上不能成立的假定前提之下，所得到的推論；雖在事實上不値得多所考慮，但這種見解在意義上是値得深加玩味的。</p>
<p>至於遠東情形，則日方野心縱極熾烈，其實力並不足以逞其野心。如果日方眞具有不惜一戰以遂其南進大慾的決心。則當早已有所發動，不致至今尚執着於不加入政策而僅空口吶喊。但是日方的戰爭準備縱不足，却又絕非予以枝節讓步所能饜足。試看天津租界局勢甫以英方讓步而稍見好轉，香港方面又遭遇重大威脅；越南縱接受日方封鎖中國邊境的要求，也並未减輕日方大軍壓境的脅迫。英法什歐洲處境困難，什遠東的遷就容係出於不得已；但這些措置，祇顯見其卑躬屈節約徒然。蓋一方面違反自身諾言，蝕損中國權利，抵觸美國對遠東的措施；一方面在事實上其自身也並不能獲得保障權益的實效；總之，無論對人對已，均屬一無是處。世人對日本有過一種幻想：以為稍予讓步可以促進溫和份子的抬頭，抑制急進派的蠢動；其實即在已往，那也不過是一種錯覺；在目前這種局勢之下，更僅足刺激急進派的貪慾，連苟安一時的效果都不能獲致。</p>
<p>遠東局勢並小像歐洲那樣複雜，中國的抗戰與美國的制裁都是安定遠東的主要因素，一切有關遠東的措施都應該環繞這一中心去運用。如果捨坦途而不由，則客觀上等於推波助瀾，揚湯止沸，只有造成像歐局一樣的混亂和黑暗而已。相信列强富局應不致懵懂至此。世亂已到最後關頭，願世人都能有澈底的覺悟。</p>

<p>平均年齡不過四十歲、每年之死亡率、曩昔雖無精確之統計、然就記憶所及、以往數年中、會員中由於自然的原因而死亡者、每千人每年平均不過二十四人左右、依此計劃、則本會每年、大約須支付賠款二萬四千元左　、此款若</p>
<p>千二百人分擔、則每年每人祇負二十元、即每人每月應分擔一元六角七分、故擬向每人每月徵收保險費一元七角、計一年可得保險費二萬四千四百八十元、再加該款之息金、則將來會員之死亡率、縱然越過上述數額、本會　不致受鉅大之賠累</p>

<p>— 龔懋德</p>
<p>騐資之必要</p>
<p>股份有限公司（以下簡稱公司）者、乃由七人以上有限責任股東組織而成之公司也。股東負任何責任；即使將來公司之財產，不足淸償債務，債權人對於公司股東亦無淸償債務之請求權，故在股份有限公司其對於公司債務之總担保，僅爲公司之全部財產而已。</p>
<p>考公司財產之最初形態，爲股東所繳納之股款，包括金錢及依法得抵作股款之其他財產，以是當公司創立或增資之際，第一次股款已全部繳足與否？以金錢外之財產抵作股款時，關於財產之種類，價格，與公司核給之股數，確當與否？在在足以影響公司之實有財產，處處關係對於公司債務担保之强度，職是之故，在公司呈請設立登記或增資登記前，對於此類事項，有查騐之必要，此種查騐工作即普通所謂「騐資」是也。</p>
<p>關於騐資，公司法第九一條規定：一董事於就任後，應即呈請主管官署選派檢查員查騐第一次股款已吾繳足，及左列事項是否確當：</p>
<p>（一）以金錢外之財產抵作股款者，其姓名及其財產之種類價格與公司核給之股數，</p>
<p>（二）應歸公司負担之設立費用及發起人得受報酬之數額。」</p>
<p>第一〇三條規定：「董事及監察人應調查左列事項報告於創立會，</p>
<p>（一）股份總數已否認足，</p>
<p>（二）各認股人第一次股款已否繳足，</p>
<p>（三）第八十九條第三款及第九十一條各款所列事項，是否確當。</p>
<p>董事及監察人如有由發起人中選出者，創立會得另選檢查人，為前項之調查報吿。」</p>
<p>第一九四條規定：「監察人應調查左列各款事項報吿於股東會，</p>
<p>（一）所募新股已否認足，</p>
<p>（二）各新股第一次應繳之股款已否繳足，</p>
<p>（三）有以金錢外之財產抵作股款者，所核給股份之數，是否確當，</p>
<p>為前項之調查及報吿，股東會得選檢查人</p>
<p>主管官署騐資之優點</p>
<p>依公司法第九一條，第一〇三條，及第一九四條（已列舉於前節）之內容而觀，吾人可知：凡發起設立之公司，須由主管官署騐資；招慕設立之公司，由董事，監察人或股東會選任之檢查人騐資，公司增資時，由監察人或另選之檢查人檢資，雖同屬騐資，而騐資主體各異，各種騐資制度之效果孰優孰劣，單憑理論，固難作確切之判斷，惟就過去之事實而言，主管官署處嚴正之地位監督之立塲，其騐資之結果，最可孚信，已無可諱言者也。</p>
<p>按所謂「騐資」，爲檢騐公司資本之充實性，分別言之，旣係指查，騐股份已否認足？第一次應繳股款已吾繳足？以金錢外之財產抵股款者，公司核給之股數，是否確當？等事項，自不宜由繳納股款，經慕股份，或核給股份之股東，自行查騐，以防偏私舞弊也。由此言之，欲貫澈騐資之任務起見，須由股東以外之第三人擔任查騐，但若第三人係由股東會選任之檢查人，則因被選之檢查人在事實上例多與公司一部或全部股東有密切關係，或係與整個公司之利害互相一致，致其所抱之檢查態度袒護有關係之股東，或利害一致之公司，是乃情理之常，於是檢查報告之可靠性，亦不無疑問矣。然則究由何人查騐，最爲適宜乎？自當首推主管官署，蓋主管官署受全國人民之託付，而處理其職權內之事務，以保護全體人民之利益爲其最高理想，其與公司，股東及一般人民之關係無分疏密，故立塲公正，地位超然，其騐資之報告，當然最具確實性，毫無疑義。</p>
<p>由董事監察人或檢查人騐資之弊害</p>
<p>由董事監察人或檢查人騐資之弊害，在營利事業所得稅施行前，尙少發現，惟自所得稅開徵後，漸漸見諸事實，因營利事業所得稅係視所得額合資本額百分率之多少而依規定稅率課稅，且祇准以公積三分之一併入資本計算，致少數取巧之企業家，難免於創立公司之時，即行利用招募設立不必呈請中管官署騐資之規定，故意虛報實收資本，預開此後逃稅之鬥。</p>
<p>至於已成立之公司，亦有一部分鑒於現行之課稅標準，不無欠缺公平之處，爲求所得稅之負擔，趨於合理起見，而實行增資。實行增資之諸公司，依照穩健合法之步驟而增資者，，固居絕對多數，然利用增資登記不必經主管官署騐資，而引用各毬不正當之伎倆，人爲的膨脹名義資本（註册資本）者，在事實上，似不可謂絕對不有。</p>
<p>當此類公司呈請設立登記或增資登記時，經濟部或已洞悉其中僞情，惟以職權所限，無從獲得眞憑實據，如登記要件，無所欠缺，祇能照准。然而此類公司如日益增加，則匪獨國家之稅收將蒙受重大損失，即善意第三人（債權人及普通人民）、之利益，亦將永受妨碍，爲保護國家與人民之利益起見，對於此類公司之產生，自非予以防止不可也。</p>
<p>補救之辦法</p>
<p>欲防止股份有限公司虛報資本，最有效之辦法，莫若規定股份有限公司呈請設立登記，</p>
<h3 id="c78">米價前途之懸測　米風潮週年紀念 <a href="#c78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>— 鮑樂蒂</p>
<p>囤戶手裏的存貨、霉節前已先後脫舊換新，米價又開始橫漲了。時間上和去年差不多，大有米風潮做週年之慨。外加又有種種藉口，所以飛漲得更有聲有色。但物價趨勢，總脫不了供需關係。居奇操縱者的投機利益，只有先脫手者爲强。如果要靠囤積獲利，今年的財運就大非昔比。去年囤戶之所以獲利，因爲米價從低槃上漲起，所以一帆風順。現在盤底已高得過分，這把算盤打不通了。無論米是民食，非吃不可！但河水漲齊了隄岸，便要泛濫；不會離隄上昇的，一般購買力畢竟要的束物價趨勢；話難抽象，道理是顚撲不破的。所以本文內姑置道義問題與市政當局的統制問題於不論，只就米商的財慾上打算，目前米價是否可以站住？</p>
<p>上漲理由的淸算</p>
<p>久旱不雨，災象已成：外加浙東米荒，殃及滬市，米價之漲，似乎勢所必至。實則事有所不然。</p>
<p>（一）離出霉（國曆七月十五日）尚有二十多天，誰能確保今年一定亢旱成災？民二十三年份的亢旱程度，數倍於今日，霉裏完全無雨，六七八月份的雨量少到極點；當時的高氣溫打被六十多年來的高紀錄，誰都認爲亢旱成災了。但該年仍有六七成的收成，當時米價最貴也不過每石十一元左右。何况長江中部，現巳得雨，目前氣壓轉變，正是甘霖將降的先兆。</p>
<p>（二）浙東米產本薄，故年年發生饑荒，素由蘇浙皖各地運往接濟，今年自亦不能例外。業中人誰不知之？如以浙東米荒作爲居奇藉口，只能欺騙外行，蔣委員長電令賑饑，虞洽老函電磋商，皆出於難懷桑梓的常情：今竟被米蟲恃得爲抬價理由，實在痛心！（我以爲此類文件，似以不公開爲妙；免供人利用。）</p>
<p>（三）海防一度封鎖，香港又禁米出口，洋米來源似成問題。然緬甸，暹邏，通運無阻；安南經濟，全賴米產出口，封鎖至多一時，決非久計，何况現已啟封。豆米業公會昨函租界當局時，雖謂港禁「倘不亟予設法疏通，深恐漲風難期抑止。」實則香港並非產米區，南洋班雖都路經香港，但港禁無碍洋米運滬。上海雖有不少洋米託港商代辦，但運輸時都由產地直達上海，，決無先卸港倉，再由港裝艙運滬之理。偶或有之，爲數也必極少。不過港地開禁，貨運恢復自由，總是好的。但禁不禁與米價是風馬牛。該函云云，實難自圓其說，在海防啟封，米儈失其抬價憑藉的今日；該會作此論調，似授人話柄，實　憾事。</p>
<p>（四）日本米荒，來華搜米補血；但國米因此而即發生供給不足，未免言過其實。據日本米穀對策協議會最近發表的調查報告：日本今年米穀供給總額七千八百萬石，需要總額爲八千三百萬石，供給不足的達一千萬石，但據日本農相島田在衆院報告：本年米穀供給額，如包括現有存米及已經定進之暹雜外米，合計有一萬萬石。則反有餘，無論孰是孰非？但彼如眞來華搜購，程度也決不如一般人想象之大。</p>
<p>（五）在華日軍就地食用；確係增大國米消費的又一病根。但戰時今日人口之傷亡，未始不可相抵。中國農村人口，一向過剩。雖在今日，農村勞力依然充斥，生產上決無問題。况今日米價激漲，無形中已獎勵農民增加稻田，增加米產。今年米產供給，必較常年大增，可以逆料。</p>
<p>（六）戰爭區域，農民輟耕，確係生產上一大威脅。但中國農民之沉着勇敢，舉世無匹；兵到走避，兵去續耕，滬戰時期，滬郊農事照常進行，即其明證。且觀國府農本局調查報告：民二十七年米產尚佔二十六年份的八一％，其時戰事皆在產米區域進行，收穫尚如此良好：何况戰事現已移到山嶽地帶，更無碍於農作</p>
<p>（七）上海雖非產米區，但居全國產米區的集散中心點。戰時情形雖已略變，但尚有年產三寓萬石左右的蘇浙皖的稻田做背景。三省總人口至多七千萬，需要額至多不過二萬萬，顯然供給有餘。上海米市，本負供給全國之責，現在僅供給上海及附近一帶，無論如何，供給不會不足。</p>
<p>（八）日本壟斷產地米穀的運銷，上海國米供給，似有問題。殊不知日本壟斷的主要目的在謀利，這便是他們「以戰養戰」的一種手段。如果根絕米穀運滬，內地農民經濟必隨之破產。華農破產，果投日本所好；但他們從此失去搶奪的憑藉，在他們「以戰養戰」目的下萬無此理。目前我國沿江洽海一帶港口幾都淪陷，獨上海寗波等倖免，豈日軍獨厚上海人與寗波人吾？不，只留此以便其搶奪耳。明乎此，日本不致根絕內地米之運滬，似可斷言。</p>
<p>米業處境之分</p>
<p>一般物價趨勢總小脫貨物本身的供需和社會購買力强弱的支配。如上所述，米價實無續漲根據。今之暴漲，何以故？一言以蔽之：米蟲做週年，製造一個新的高水準，藉以打開他們目前業務上的艱難罷了。如不漲價，日僞的掠奪也難謀新發展，如此這般，乃造成今日的局面。民食果被犧牲了，但他們也要自食其果。讓我再放肆一下，略述其中的因果。</p>
<p>去年五月初，米價尚在十四元限價下。其時日偽的中間敲索，無形中只能以產地價和上海米價間的差額爲限。吾則，運商就要裹足，日僞就無從掠奪。此時，產地價，上海價，和日偽的掠奪額，都維持着一個均衡。相安無事了兩年模樣。</p>
<p>上海百物高漲，米業獨受限價限制；一實屬不平！」於是米行先把批價抬到十四　，而寬放米號的零售價在十四元限價之外的幾角。限價有如處女膜，一破就漫無拘束，米價於是開始飛漲，日僞的中間掠奪額就跟着增加，而產地米價也跟着急速飛漲。在此循環騰貴中，上海米商，產地米商，運商米販，以及日僞中間掠奪者，果然都大發其財。但上海米價轟過了洋米價，上海米商就不能再抬價，因爲國米過貴，捉成洋米暢銷。這是上海米價最近過去所以穩定的理由，也就是上海米業的財慾受到的束的開始。因爲他的來本已重，不高抬自無宏利可得。</p>
<p>上海米價雖受洋米價限制，但產地價還在續漲。產地價越和上海價接近，從中勒索的日僞利益額就越少。於是在「穩定淪陷區民食的幌子下，日僞開始統制淪陷區裏的米價。產地米價便不能自由續漲。像蘇州城內曾被抑在每石二十元的限價，其時上海價已在四十元之上，可見日偽的勒索額可達十五元至二十元的鉅利。這是產地米價受到暴力約束的開始</p>
<p>上海米價受洋米價壓住，洋米價又受黑匯價壓住；產地價則受槍柄壓住。但日僞仍得追隨洋米價的進退而伸縮其勒索額。上海米蟲，產地米蟲，以及運商米販們的利益，就被日僞從中一捧打消。這是他們帮兇所得的惡報。雖則是咎由自取，但他們目前的業務已發生艱難，確也事實。至此，他們理應猛醒，亟起合向中間掠奪者反攻才有生路可圖：豈知他們不惜一誤再誤，仍抄舊路，一味向消費者進攻。</p>
<p>當五二黑匯風潮發生之初，米蟲們欣然自得：洋米激漲，國米追踪，豈知匯市風潮旋即平伏，黑匯即逐步回長。米市漲風，即受壓住。心正不甘，浙東米荒驟起警報，良機難得，擴大運用。又助以旱荒，海防封鎖等等威脅，洋米領導國米的時代，就王變而爲國米領導洋米的新時代。而今尚在四出散播空氣，申言將來米價要漲到怎樣怎樣？大有追踪德國的神經戰略之勢，實行其先聲奪人的手段。然而都無根據。所以把米價扳得愈高，前途的危險也愈大。只消大雨傾盆，人心寬慰；不免就要刮起跌風。所以脫手愈早愈安全，如果扳緊小放，勢必愈扳愈僵。反挨人駡！不智孰甚？</p>

<h3 id="c89">米貴罪言 <a href="#c89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>— 島客</p>
<p>建議救濟辦法</p>
<p>民以食爲天，「米」是大衆恃以生活的源泉，古人說：「倉廩實而知禮節，衣食足而知榮辱。」換句話說，大象有米」藏，就能够守「禮尙「節」，大家衣暖「食」飽，就能够尊「榮」知「辱」。再說得明白點，家裏沒有米藏，乾脆，會鋌而走險，沒有衣，食，就罔知榮辱之分，會不顧一切，迫得作奸犯科了。大家苦於沒有「吃」，飢餓之火的爆發，更那裏會遵守秩序？更何從談起治安？</p>
<p>窮苦大衆的同胞，身逢刦難，旣遭炮火流亡之痛，復遇米　囤積之苦，米價的在漲，漫無限制，洋米售六十七元五角一石，杜米喊七十四元五角一石，在米奸商趁火打刦下，窮人的咽嘴被又住了！試問窮人們，還有什麽生路？還有什麽命活？我不禁嘆「其亡其亡，繫於苞桑」了！瞻念前途，豈眞將有易子析骸而食，與人食人，（窮人拚富人）的悲劇演出嗎？</p>
<p>吾思之，吾重思之，局勢之嚴重，無有如今日之甚者！本來現在的世界，是一個人食入的世界，强陵弱，衆暴寡，大吞小，小呑大，（指小國侵略大國），那裏會有什麽文明？那裏會有什麽秩序？所見到的，是血腥的世界是悲慘的結局！非至整個人類被毀滅而不止！？回溯孤島上自和國軍脫節，離開了祖國卵翼的懷抱之後，米價從十四元一石，而二十元，而三十元，而四十元，而……以至於今天的七八八十元一石，究受誰之所賜？</p>
<p>筆者繞室徬徨，五內憂憤，幾欲寢投機奸商之皮而食其肉！嗚呼！米貴的「貴」字，竟也勢利，從「虫」從「貝」，象徵着米蛀「虫」祇知有「貝」之財，兇惡剝削，罔顧窮人倒懸之急，豈古人倉頡預知，有此警惕之「字」乎？救飢猶救火，渴望上海團體領袖，慈善大家，以及負有治安職責的租界當局，迅速實行統制囤米，計口授糧。（先速調查戶口）按照棧米成本，而急速舉辦平糶，以救飢民燃眉之急！昔春秋辛氏計然仕越，陳說越王，一察好尙，貴流通，尙平均，戒停滯」之策，王用其策而大治。故希望租界當局，效「計然」之所爲，設法疎通洋·杜米運輸，妥籌以富濟貧之策，（富家藏的米、太多也，）戒（懲戒也）奸商囤米居奇，要做到察好尙，貴流通，尙平均，戒停滯之目的，而後窮人獲救，不特民生之幸亦治安前途之幸也。</p>

<p>— 亦名</p>
<p>自從什麼都漲了價，衣食住行都感覺到困難，單就講個衣字吧，要添置衣裳，難於上靑天，一伴長衫，非二三十金不辦，這種困難固不必說，就是買雙襪子，也要算算才好，吾則一元多錢一雙的襪，還不見得好，穿沒多久，就要頭穿底落，化爲烏有了。</p>
<p>天熱了，衣着中的襪子倒大可免去，來個乾脆的赤足，你決不要去顧慮到被人家指說「癟三之類的批評，或者被指爲摩登也好，總之，我省我的好了。但是襪子可以不穿，鞋子却不可不着，那末起碼的買雙布鞋穿穿，也得化上五元以上的代價，皮鞋更貴得昨舌，一雙的代價，足可以抵從前鄉下農家半年的開支，簡直不是「富人一席酒，窮漢半年糧」而是「平常一雙鞋，窮漢半年糧」了，但是，現在的糧也貴了。</p>
<p>我是向來主張不坐車子的，所以無論電車公共汽車的如何漲價，均與我無關，只苦了兩條腿：然而想到人是應該勞動的，况且又可藉以多一個運動的機會，也就非常自慰了。但是不幸的鞋子，經此過度的運動，沒多久的服務，到相當時間，就毫不客氣的露　給你看，實行服務中止的宣吿，照會你需要繼任者辦移交手續了。不得已而求其次，那末跑鞋，球鞋就是唯一的恩物，然而穿了多濕氣，也是個缺點。</p>
<p>現在天熱了，應時的拖鞋，又是必要之物，我因爲要經濟些，找到了去年的舊拖鞋的皮面子，想配個底，那知倒要二元半錢，也就只得暫緩起來。</p>
<p>禮拜日的那天，我忽然在箱子角落裏翻到了一雙以前手工做的，而一向把它輕視的木拖鞋，這時想起它現在的功用來，就像發現一樣寳貝似的，把它穿起來。的確，好極了，旣舒適，又便利，無論洗浴或浴後，或乘凉，每當回家，就把它換上，與鞋子交替。如此，簡接上省了金錢，直接上省了物質，豈不兩美？讀者諸君如果贊成的話，在這物力維艱的今日，何訪自己做一雙試試。</p>
<h3 id="c91">臥室的光綫 <a href="#c91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>— 范學暉</p>
<p>近世各種科學逐漸發達，臥室的光綫配置，已經有很多的人在研究和改正。</p>
<p>近代的建築學，以爲臥室的窗戶，應照臥室的面積四分之一大小，才適合衛生上的設備。</p>
<p>臥室的光綫不宜充分的强烈，也不宜過分的陰暗，若光度强烈，則使目力易於困倦，若光度過弱，則辨物更傷目力，此皆有妨碍個人身體的康健；故在一般情形而說，臥室之光綫，必須有適當的配合才是。</p>
<p>光綫不宜炫目，必須溫柔。如今新式的臥室，牆上宜用無光的油漆，最爲合宜。</p>
<p>就是新式家庭的家具，亦以無光的淺灰油漆爲佳。無光的淺灰的家具，它有吸收光度的效用，不會如其他色彩的家具，十分强烈地反射光綫的流弊，使人感覺到有些不安。</p>
<h3 id="c92">上海走路指南 <a href="#c92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>— 次愷</p>
<p>走路的範圍是路，工具是車，目的是房子，決定房子的標識，就是方向和門牌。</p>
<p>除了少數倒置和凹入的例外（如霞飛路拉都路一帶）門牌號碼增加有一定方向。横路自東而西，直路法租界自北而南，公共租界自南至北。如人們照號碼增加的方向走，馬路（或河）的左邊是單數號碼，右邊是雙數號碼。而彼垂直相交之路所截之一段中，號數常自爲起訖。每段號碼平均少自四五十，多至一百餘，但每有斷號。</p>
<p>由於上述的原理，可以我出定方向的一個好方法。下面就是八句口訣：</p>
<p>法租界的：公共租界的：</p>
<p>順左加，南。　順左加，西。</p>
<p>順右加，西。　順右加，北。</p>
<p>逆左加，東。　逆左加，南。</p>
<p>逆右加，北。　逆右加，東。</p>
<p>如果我們走路時不曉得自己朝那一方向，第一先看自己是否順着號碼進加的方向？如然，叫做「順」，如否叫做「逆」，第二再看和所走路相交的截路，它的號碼到底從左邊加過來或右邊加過來，以定是「左加」或「右加」，於是背出口訣，就可以曉得自己所走方向了。</p>
<p>公共租界東部的路，可由路名看出方向來，省名的是直路，城市名的横路。</p>
<p>至於要辨別你到底在那一租界，可以看馬路旁邊的電柱。公共租界的是方稜紅漆的木柱，法租界的是三稜白色的水泥柱。雖然法租界也有方稜紅漆的木柱，但公共租界則沒有水泥柱的。如要知道是否出了租界，可以看門牌版，租界的門牌版，藍色白字，可以辨別。</p>
<p>車站如沒有月台或大牌，可找電柱。正式的車站處電柱上有一段紅漆，招呼車站處則有一段綠漆，二者都可在遠處望見。</p>
<p>法租界的公共汽車票和車頭等票同。公共租界則否茲將二租界頭等三等車票列比較表，以便一見即可識別</p>
<p>法租界：顏色鮮麗，紙　較薄。</p>

<p>在一切菜肴的輔佐品中，最便宜而又最合適的，要算是雪菜了。雪菜一名雪裏紅，出在太湖一帶，冬季放在缸裏鹽漬，密密蓋緊，第二年春季就可取吃，很有鮮味，好在無論甚麽葷的素的菜裏，都可放進去的。在這年頭兒那一樣東西不貴，魚啊，肉啊，蝦啊，都貴得驚人，鷄鴨更小用說了。譬如人口多的人家，買了四五角的猪肉，那裏經得起筷頭上一撩，於是做主婦的就得想個經濟辦法，把肉切成了絲，放這磨五分或一角的雪菜在內，（自己倘有着，那是再好也沒有，隨時可用。）就可以應付日夜兩碗，而大家也經吃多了。此外可以和雪菜「合作」的，眞多得不勝枚舉。你可不要看輕了他，雪菜妙蝦仁，雪菜小黃魚，有時也可以上筵席的。就是素的菜裏，如雪菜燒豆腐，雪菜炒茶豆芽或黃豆芽，也覺得很鮮，總之雪菜這東西，眞如藥料裏的甘草。常常用得着它的。</p>

<h3 id="c95">中華書局練習生學習員應試記 <a href="#c95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>— 三厚</p>
<p>在本月初的各報上，有一則像磁石那麼地富於吸引力的廣告，那就是中華書局駐滬辦事處招考練習生，學習員啟事。這是如何欣喜的一個消息啊！</p>
<p>這次投考的資格，規定：（一）初中畢業執有文憑者。（二）本屆暑期畢業之初中生。（三）高中肄業曾在其他商業機關服務者；幷須精於寫算，略懂一些簿記。手續很簡單，只要你寫一封自薦信，寄至哈同路中華書局駐滬辦事處，幷附半身照片一張就行了。</p>
<p>中華書局向來招考戰員，練習生，是並不公開的。像去年一次，連報紙也不登，只有局內職員才會知道，所以與試的人並不多。這次公開考試，報名的人數差不多有一千三百餘人。可見一般靑年失業之多和謀事之切！</p>
<p>經過嚴格的選剔後，准予應試約計二百四十餘人，考期是上星期日上午，地點假南陽路濱海中學。</p>
<p>因爲考試的人數是那麼多，所以分兩决舉行，第一塲是八時起，第二塲是十時半起。主考者爲該局賬務部主任武堉幹先生等，監試者爲孫宗復，許達年等十餘人。</p>
<p>考試的科目分國文，英文，常識，算術與簿記等四種。國文試題是很簡便的，做作文一篇，題目是「求學與求業」。</p>
<p>英文試題計分兩類：（一）名詞譯英，共生字六個：信紙，信封，自來水筆，折扣，發票，收據，大都關於商業方面。（二）詞句譯漢，包括詞句十一題：關於商業方面的，如Dra-ft，bill，Here　is　a　bot-tle　of　high　quality等；關於普通常識方面的，如Season　ticket，eleva-tor，telephone等。</p>
<p>常識試題凡九個，內容無所不有。例如：（一）現在往重慶有幾條路可走？其經過重要地方試列舉之。（二）你所喜歡讀的書籍和雜誌有些什麼，列舉出來幷分別說明其優點何在？（三）寄平信，掛號信，快信，航空信之郵費各若干？（指寄外埠者）（四）「投資」與「投機」有何不同？</p>
<p>算術與簿記試題，計算術兩題與簿記四題。算術第二題頗爲繁複，今照錄如下：茲有男工十三人，女工八人，童工七人，合包一工作，計三十四天完工。共得工資九百八十六元，議定照能力分配，男工能力等於女工之二倍，又等於童工之三倍，問每人每日得工資若于？簿記四題爲（一）單式簿記與複式簿記之異點？（二）成本會計與普通會計有何不同，（三）何謂簿記之要素？（四）資產超過負債之凈數，會計術語稱之爲何？</p>
<p>聽說這次名額內定六十名，考取者分派該局賬務部，編輯所，發行所等處服務。在服務期間，除支取正薪外，尚有基本津貼，生活津貼等等。將來習業期滿，還可升爲正式職員。</p>

<p>— 史偉</p>
<p>誰也不能否認，中華民族是團結起來了。但誰也不能承認，這團結已經非常鞏固了。大的方面讓別人去講，我們來看看職工方面的情形。</p>
<p>首先我們應當認識認識在中國完成其偉大事業的過程中，職工們的努力是起決定作用的；因之，加强職工間的團結，便成爲非常重要的問題了。</p>
<p>對症才能下藥，職工間的團結究竟有什麼缺陷呢？</p>
<p>無庸否認，半封建半殖民地的經濟形態控制下的中國；其各產業企業部鬥就表現出十足的封建性，僱傭職工大都是朝中無人莫做官的，因之也會有「一朝天子一朝臣的事情，對職工的團結則橫加限制……這方面是職工們不能好好地團結起來的客觀原因。</p>
<p>主觀方面的則是：一，職員看不起工人，練習生。在同一階層間，先來者看不起新來者。二，寗波人覺得廣東人硬綳綳，廣東人看看寗波人太小氣，江北人則被大家看不起了，這是一種地方觀念。三，依靠「牌頭」，個人向上爬，損人利己。四，自掃門前雪的劣根性。五，男女之間的關係大都是「授受不親」的，等等。</p>
<p>顯然地，這些錯誤觀念是不能存在的。第一，工人的堅決，練習生的思想進步，對職員有着很大的幫助，爲什麼要看不起他們呢？</p>
<p>第二，在整個民族團結起來的今天，我們還堅持這種地方觀念幹嗎呢？第三，依靠「牌頭」，個人向上爬是行不通的，應該注意的是集體的力量。第四，自管自，是管不了的，慢慢會把自己送進墳墓裏去的。第五，在不分男女並肩而幹的現在，「男女授受不親」也不該存在了。</p>
<p>至於改造產業部門本身的缺陷，這同我們目前正在進行的事業是不能分割的。</p>
<p>願大家來注意這個問題。</p>

<p>第二章　「一頁往史！」</p>
<p>霍桑不答，但把那幾張照片給李芝範瞧。李芝範瞧了一瞧，便抽出兩張半身西裝的來。</p>
<p>他指着一張說：「這個就是姓余的。」又指一張二寸的小照片，「這個就是這幾天常在這裏出進的，個子高些的一個。」</p>
<p>我湊近去瞧；那姓余的年紀衹二十左右，面貌很漂亮，還有較小的一張，年事較大，下碩方闊，一雙眼睛特別有神。</p>
<p>霍桑點點頭就把這兩張照片放在胸口袋裏，其餘的重新放在抽屜裏，將抽屜關好。</p>
<p>霍桑向李芝範說：「李先生，現在你可以回樓上去歇一歇罷。關於昨夜的事，我想先問問這裏的僕人們。如果有什麼借重你的地方，再來請敎。我想你總不會討厭。」</p>
<p>李芝範急忙答道：「這什麼話？麗蘭死得這樣慘，衹要能够給伊伸寃，我的能力辦得到什麼事，我都肯做。」</p>
<p>霍桑鞠了一個躬。「謝謝你。」接着他就目送那老人彎着背帶着咳嗽踱出去。</p>
<p>倪金壽立起來間道：「可要把那老毛叫進來？牠在外面門房裏。」</p>
<p>霍桑道：「不，你先把那個女僕叫來。」</p>
<p>倪金壽應了一聲，剛纔走出會客室的門，那李芝範忽又退回進來。</p>
<p>他說道：「霍先生，對不起，我眞粗心，我的烟嘴又忘了。」他走到書桌面前，從桌邊上拿起了那枚假象牙烟嘴，重新鞠個躬走出去。</p>
<p>我向霍桑說道：「我剛才就猜想這烟嘴不像是兇手遺留的。因爲兇手走進來行刺，決不會這樣從從容容地啣着紙烟。」</p>

<h3 id="e1">The French are Limiting Freight Transportation on the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway. Foreign Minister Wang Issues Important Statement. Japan's Demands Regarding the Sino-French Treaty are Baseless. If Japan Launches Armed Aggression in Vietnam, We Will Adopt Self-Defense Measures to Ensure Survival and Independence. <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing: Regarding the Japanese threat to the French government to halt general freight transportation between China and Vietnam, Foreign Minister Wang issued an important statement today. The original text is as follows: "French Indochina, geographically linked to Kunming, China, has always maintained close relations. In terms of commerce and economic needs, we have benefited from mutual adjustments for many years. Now, Vietnam is particularly important as China's international transportation route. Trade between the New China and foreign countries, as well as China's own security, are greatly dependent on it. China and France have several treaties regarding French Indochina, the most recent being the 'Treaty on Relations between Vietnam and the Chinese Border Provinces' signed on May 16, 1930. According to the provisions of this treaty, France allows various goods to pass through Vietnam, including arms and ammunition. The Chinese government, considering the specific obligations undertaken by France, naturally has the right to demand that it fulfill its obligations and maintain Vietnam as an international trade route. However, in recent years, the Chinese government has not requested the passage of arms and ammunition through Vietnam, already making every possible effort to understand the difficulties faced by a friendly nation. Unfortunately, the Japanese government is going further, taking advantage of the situation to openly and covertly threaten the French government, forcing it to halt general transportation between China and Vietnam. The Chinese government cannot help but deeply regret France's failure to firmly refuse. Japan's demand aims to impose a blockade on a friendly nation, a blockade that is completely unfounded in both the Sino-French treaties and international law. The French government's failure to decisively reject Japan's demands will inevitably encourage Japan's acts of undermining peace in the Far East. The Chinese government cannot but be greatly concerned about this. The Chinese government is convinced that any act of military aggression by Japan in any region of Asia or the Pacific, regardless of the form it takes, is solely intended to use its aggression to achieve its fundamental goal of conquering China. It is particularly evident that if Japan occupies Vietnam, its aim will be none other than to seize French territory and inevitably take the route through Vietnam to attack China. Therefore, if Japan engages in acts of armed aggression in Vietnam and other places, the Chinese government, in order to maintain its survival and independence and to pursue its consistent anti-aggression policy, cannot but take all necessary self-defense measures under such circumstances due to Japan's coercion. This is hereby declared." (Dispatch of the 23rd)</p>
<p>Chongqing: After learning that the French authorities in Vietnam had accepted Japan's demand to halt freight transportation through Vietnam, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has lodged an urgent protest with the French authorities. (Reuters dispatch of the 23rd)</p>
<p>Chongqing: According to claims here, after Japan made a demand to French Indochina to immediately prohibit the transportation of arms from Vietnam to Chongqing, and at the same time, to allow Japanese inspectors to be dispatched to the border to monitor freight transportation, French Indochina immediately accepted it. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has therefore lodged an urgent protest with the Vietnamese authorities. (Reuters dispatch of the 23rd)</p>
<p>Tokyo: It was announced here last night that after France allowed the cessation of imports of strategically related raw materials into China, the Japanese government decided to dispatch twenty inspectors from both the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of the Army to reside in various transportation centers in French Indochina, such as Hanoi, Haiphong, and Lao Cai, to monitor goods transported to China and prohibit the import of major commodities into China, including iron, cotton, and railway materials. The detailed list will be decided tomorrow. The Franco-Japanese agreement will soon be implemented. (Associated Press dispatch of the 23rd)</p>
<p>Washington: The U.S. government, in this world of combat, must divide its attention among many aspects, such as assisting Britain in achieving victory for democracy in Europe, resisting any attack by any party on the omnipotent trade of the twenty-one American republics, and dealing with the threatening situation in the Far East. According to news reports, Japan has concentrated its naval forces near Vietnam. U.S. Secretary of State Hull refused to issue new comments on the U.S. Far East policy, but he mentioned to newspaper reporters the recent declaration of the United States' concern that the current situation in the Pacific should not be overturned. It is said that official news about the rumored concentration of the Japanese navy in the Hainan area has not yet been received. The U.S. government is clearly concerned about the possibility of the war spreading to the Far East. The "cartel" system currently being implemented in the Americas</p>
<p>(Note: This system is a union of manufacturers to maintain prices.) Although the main purpose is to cope with the trade offensive of omnipotent countries in Europe, this system will also be implemented with the same trade methods used in the East. The announcement of this cartel system coincides with the visit of Kato, the former Japanese special envoy to China, to many South American countries, and the subsequent meeting here with diplomatic representatives of Japanese countries in the Americas to discuss trade and other issues. This situation may have significant meaning. Kato will leave here for Tokyo in the next few days. The news that Song Ziwen, bearing an important mission, arrived in the United States by plane from Manila two days ago has aroused great attention here. Chinese sources here have not yet received news of Song's arrival. (Reuters dispatch of the 23rd)</p>
<p>Danjing: The newly appointed Japanese ambassador to the Scandinavian countries gave a speech yesterday, saying that there may be major changes in the Far East situation recently, mainly in Vietnam, and hoped that the war in China could be ended soon. (Haitong dispatch of the 23rd)</p>
<h3 id="e2">Japan Pressures Britain, Situation in Hong Kong is Tense, Shenzhen and Shatoujiao are Occupied, Protests Filed Regarding Freight Transportation on the Burma Road <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Hong Kong: Hong Kong residents are watching the border developments today. Five hundred Chinese refugees fled here yesterday to seek refuge. Many of the refugees were injured. One refugee died in a Hong Kong hospital last night due to injuries. The refugees claimed that although the Japanese army did not encounter any resistance, they indiscriminately shot at villagers. Recently, news from the border area claimed that the Japanese army was heading north along the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway to cut off what the Japanese claimed to be new supply lines. The area was garrisoned by the Japanese army last night. Some people here believe that the Japanese military actions along the border from Shenzhen to Shatoujiao and the concentration of Japanese transport ships in Nantou are Japan's beginning to exert pressure on Britain, hoping to block the Burma Road and prevent the import of military materials into China. They believe that the Japanese army deliberately carries out military actions on the border to conduct a demonstration movement towards Hong Kong. They also believe that the Japanese military actions will ultimately put forward strict demands to Britain to block the Burma Road, because after the Vietnamese authorities agreed to block the transportation route to China, the Burma Road is China's only "lifeline" for foreign relations in the southwest. However, the British military spokesperson here does not take the Japanese military concentration on the border seriously, because the Japanese army had notified the British military authorities in advance. The spokesperson continued that the purpose of the Japanese army occupying the area bordering the British colony is to eliminate Chinese guerrillas, so the spokesperson believes that there is no reason for terror. Reliable sources claim that the Japanese army landed in Nantou, northwest of Kowloon, and went straight to Shenzhen. A Japanese bomber bombed Shenzhen yesterday, killing one Chinese and injuring three. The "Ta Kung Pao" reported that 5,000 Japanese troops occupied the area from Shenzhen to Shatoujiao without encountering resistance. The "Ta Kung Pao" also reported that Japanese transport ships were concentrated in Nantou. (Associated Press dispatch of the 23rd)</p>
<p>Hong Kong: The situation in Hong Kong today is extremely tense, because millions of Chinese refugees are flocking here due to the Japanese army's occupation of the border areas. Among the refugees are many well-to-do workers who were engaged in reconstruction work in the border area a few days ago after the Japanese army withdrew. In addition, there are mostly ordinary villagers, carrying their luggage, carrying infants in swaddling clothes, and dragging their children into the country in a panic. Last night, the police and the army here took care of the refugees in the refugee camps in the pouring rain and were very busy, without rest all night. More than 5,000 people have now been settled in the refugee camps. This situation will inevitably cause a new problem for the newly established committee engaged in studying the problem of overcrowding in this area, and it wants to find ways to reduce the population in order to prevent the danger of epidemics. There are different reports on the number of Japanese soldiers active on the border, some saying only 800, some saying as many as 5,000, and according to earlier Japanese news and what the Japanese military authorities said, there are six teams of Japanese troops in the area. Observers estimate that there are about 3,000. At the same time, there is much news that the Japanese army intends to expand its combat range to Huizhou, and it is heard that a team of Japanese naval marines is currently concentrated in Bias Bay, which is believed to be for this attempt. However, the military authorities in Hong Kong have repeatedly stated today that there is no reason for alarm in this situation, and that even if the Japanese army occupies this area, the corner of Hong Kong is still safe. (Associated Press dispatch of the 23rd)</p>
<p>Hong Kong: At 4:00 pm on the 22nd, the Japanese army invaded Shenzhen from Nantou, with an unknown number of people. Refugees have retreated into the British leased territory. (Dispatch of the 22nd)</p>
<p>Guangzhou: Reuters has recently received semi-official Japanese news that Japan has filed a protest with the British regarding the transportation of various materials through Myanmar, and said that the Japanese army's concentration in Shenzhen has nothing to do with the above-mentioned protest. (Reuters dispatch of the 23rd)</p>
<p>Hong Kong: The situation around the British border today is as it was yesterday, but the British authorities are continuing to be on guard in order to cope with any possible accidents. Yesterday evening, it was estimated that there were 3,000 Japanese soldiers in the border area, and it is believed that more will continue to arrive. Although the authorities have reiterated assurances, observers believe that the Japanese actions are a prelude to protesting the supply of goods to Chongqing via the Burma Road. French Indochina has now developed the same situation. (Reuters dispatch of the 23rd)</p>
<p>Guangzhou: The Japanese side issued a statement on the military actions around the British leased territory, saying that the Japanese air force cooperated with the land army to bomb dozens of civilian ships carrying military materials. A large number of materials were found at the Pingmin (transliteration) station, 15 miles north of Shenzhen. It is not yet known whether the Japanese army will remain stationed in Shenzhen after clearing the Chinese guerrillas. (Reuters dispatch of the 23rd)</p>
<p>The Chinese Army Prepares a Fierce Counteroffensive</p>
<p>After the Japanese army took military action near Hong Kong, people generally feared that Hong Kong would be blockaded. Today, they received news that the Chinese army was preparing a fierce counteroffensive. The Japanese army moved along the Kowloon border from Shenzhen to Shatoujiao, and the Japanese army has concentrated in Nantou. All of these indicate that the Japanese army is attempting to prevent Britain from assisting China. The Burma Road, the channel for China to import arms, has almost become the indirect target of the Japanese army's actions. When Japanese officials answered questions, they declared that the Japanese army reoccupied Shenzhen because Hong Kong continued to supply China with arms and must be stopped. Hong Kong officials claimed that Hong Kong did not transport arms to China, and they pointed out that the Hong Kong authorities had strictly controlled the arms trade. A British military spokesperson here declared that the purpose of the Japanese army occupying the area near Kowloon was to attack Chinese guerrillas, "and there is no reason to be surprised." Moreover, Japanese officials notified the Hong Kong authorities before the Japanese army took action. According to an International News Agency reporter, the total number of Japanese troops concentrated near the Kowloon border is 3,000. Currently, there are only 600 Japanese troops in Shenzhen. It is expected that the Chinese army will carry out a counteroffensive. (International News Agency dispatch of the 23rd)</p>

<h3 id="e6">Lessons from the International Turmoil <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>The "September 18th Incident" in 1931 was a signal that the world situation was turning from light to darkness. Since then, the international political situation has been deteriorating day by day. The evolution of this matter not only failed to conform to what the world expected, but also had the opposite effect. Almost every ending has increased the suffering of mankind; and the recent surrender of France is even more a soul-stirring scene. Taking the current situation as a starting point, we must know that it has been nearly ten years since we entered the era of tragedy!</p>
<p>In fact, during these ten years, it is not that there were no bright factors that existed and grew, nor that there were no forces gradually building up to resist the reactionary trend. Taking the recent situation as an example, although the European situation is in a very chaotic adversity, in the Far East, China's resistance war is even more glorious, standing as the mainstream of the anti-aggression struggle; and the United States, its various operations are also increasingly becoming more active and clear, developing in direct proportion to the international aggressive forces. However, these factors have failed to curb the expansion of the dark trend from the beginning, nor have they been able to prevent the deterioration of the international situation. This is not necessarily due to the lack of strength or the lack of application; mainly, it cannot but be attributed to the ambiguous understanding of certain people in the international community, which led to the delay of the opportunity; or even greedy for short-term gains, working for the tiger, so that even if the side representing justice and fairness has wise and intelligent measures, it is difficult to achieve the expected results; This allows those who believe in violence to take advantage of loopholes to satisfy their greed. Countless examples of such heartbreaking events can be found from 1931 to the present: Among them, the evil consequences caused by the so-called realism policy are even more obvious, and they have ultimately led to various tragedies in Europe. Evolving to the present, several large and small countries in Europe have been destroyed, and people's beliefs and reason have also been strongly attacked; but the lessons of facts do not seem to have fully played the role of shocking the deaf; that is, those political mistakes in the past have not yet been thoroughly eliminated, and even on several major issues, they are still inevitably following the footsteps of the past. For example, recently, President Roosevelt's measures to deal with the European situation, strengthening the use of government agencies, are still troubled by those pedantic politicians with endless disputes. For example, as the frequent reports in recent days show, the path taken by Britain and France to deal with the Far East is still a continuation of the previous realism policy. From Europe to the Far East, from the beginning to the final moment of life and death, some people's understanding of the current situation still cannot be matched with the actual urgent tasks, which is a very regrettable thing.</p>
<p>Regarding the situation in the United States. I firmly believe that the current difficulties are only the current phenomenon. I firmly believe that there are many insightful people in that country. In this difficult time, they will never be misled by a part of parochial views and mislead the future of the country. What we want to simply state is that people must truly recognize the experience of France's failure this time; democracy is a commendable system, but it cannot exist alone apart from the entire destiny of the country. The United States and France are both the main sources of democratic politics, but France's over-decentralized political system and the disputes among countless parties have formed a fatal wound that hinders unity and hinders revitalization. After this defeat, this political system will almost sink with France's past glory. This is a painful current lesson that should provide a good lesson for the American people. Some people say: With President Roosevelt's talent and ambition, if he were not constrained by the limitations of the American political system, not only would his personal achievements be unlimited, but the whole world would also benefit greatly. This is an inference obtained under a hypothetical premise that cannot be established in fact; although it is not worthy of much consideration in fact, this view is worthy of deep thought in meaning.</p>
<p>As for the situation in the Far East, although Japan's ambitions are extremely strong, its strength is not enough to satisfy its ambitions. If Japan really has the determination to fight at all costs to fulfill its desire to advance south, then it should have already launched something, and it will not stick to the policy of non-participation and only shout empty slogans to this day. However, even if Japan's war preparations are insufficient, it is by no means something that can be satisfied by making minor concessions. Just look at the fact that the situation in the Tianjin Concession has improved slightly due to the British concessions, and Hong Kong has encountered major threats; even if Vietnam accepts Japan's demand to block the Chinese border, it has not reduced Japan's threat of deploying a large army. Britain and France are in a difficult situation in Europe, and their concessions in the Far East are out of necessity; but these measures only show their servility and are in vain. Because on the one hand, it violates its own promises, corrodes China's rights, and conflicts with the US measures on the Far East; on the other hand, in fact, it cannot obtain the real effect of protecting its own rights and interests; in short, it is useless to both people and oneself. The world has had an illusion about Japan: thinking that a little concession can promote the rise of moderate elements and restrain the restless actions of the radical faction; in fact, even in the past, it was just a misconception; under the current situation, it is only enough to stimulate the greed of the radical faction, and even the effect of temporary survival cannot be achieved.</p>
<p>The situation in the Far East is not as complicated as that in Europe. China's resistance war and the US sanctions are the main factors for stabilizing the Far East. All measures related to the Far East should be used around this center. If you abandon the smooth path and do not take it, it is objectively equivalent to fueling the flames and using soup to stop boiling, and it will only create chaos and darkness like the European situation. I believe that the powers should not be so ignorant as to do this. The world chaos has reached the final juncture. I hope that the world can have a thorough awakening.</p>

Before the signing, French Chief Representative General Huntziger delivered a brief statement in a heavy tone, declaring that the French government was willing to sign the agreement, but must understand the difficulties of soldiers in this environment. After speaking, he signed the agreement. At the time, the expressions on the faces of the attending representatives were extremely serious, especially the French representatives, who were very nervous. After the signing, representatives from both sides stood up and silently commemorated the fallen soldiers. After the meeting, the French representatives immediately left by plane to discuss the armistice agreement with the Italian government. (June 23rd, Huitong Telegraph)</p>
<p>Compiègne: According to a special reporter from Huitong News Agency dispatched to Compiègne, when the armistice agreement continued yesterday afternoon, the expression on the faces of the French representatives was unusually nervous. The atmosphere in the car was serious and silent, waiting for French Chief Representative General Huntziger to speak. Huntziger stood up and declared in a heavy tone that the French government had decided to sign the draft of the armistice agreement, but before signing, he wished to express his personal opinion: "As France decides to abandon combat here, it hopes that in the Calais negotiations, Germany can have a spirit that allows the two neighboring countries to coexist peacefully." Huntziger then declared to German Chief Representative General Keitel: "All soldiers should know the limits of France's ability to bear the burden. It is hoped that French soldiers will not regret the government's decision."

There was no animosity shown during the meeting between the French and German representatives. The talks were interpreted by Dr. Schmidt, the official interpreter. Schmidt also served as the interpreter when Prime Minister Chamberlain met with Hitler in September 1938. (June 23rd, Reuters)</p>

<p>French Colonial Authorities Oppose Surrender Terms</p>
<p>London: The Ministry of Information announced that London has not been able to verify the news of the French signing an armistice agreement transmitted by the American and German sides tonight, as well as the claim from Bordeaux that the armistice agreement has already been signed. It is heard that the French government has submitted a counter-proposal to France. At the same time, London has received news from all parts of the French Empire declaring loyalty to the motherland. This shows that the sentiment in the French colonies is strongly in favor of continuing the war. The governors of the colonies and the commanders of the French forces have expressed their willingness to fight alongside the British Empire against aggression. One governor said that he would never accept the terms of surrender, and other governors said that if the French central government surrendered, they intended to resist to the end, and were willing to be under British command if necessary. (June 22nd, Reuters)</p>
<p>London: According to responsible figures here, although the signing of the armistice agreement by the French government has terminated the organized resistance of the French forces at home, there is still an encouraging sign, namely, the spirit of the French colonies is very heroic. In Syria, General Mittelhauser, Commander-in-Chief of the French forces stationed in the Levant, has announced his determination to continue the war. The Governor-General of Vietnam has declared that he will never lower his national flag. The Director of Tunisia insists on continuing the war. The military and civilian authorities in other regions such as Morocco, Senegal, Cameroon, and Djibouti have also made guarantees of loyalty and support for the war. The British government has prepared to take the necessary financial measures so that each French colony can fulfill its responsibilities. As Prime Minister Churchill said, Britain's goal is to completely restore France's capital and overseas territories. (June 23rd, Reuters)</p>

<p>London: Prime Minister Churchill issued a statement today, saying that the British government was shocked and saddened to learn that the French government in Bordeaux had accepted the conditions proposed by the German side. They believe that any French government that possesses freedom, independence, and constitutional sovereignty cannot succumb to these or similar conditions. If these conditions are accepted by all the French, it will not only place France in the hands of the German and Italian dictators, but will also extend to the entirety of the French Empire. Not only will the people of France be oppressed and forced to work against their allies, but the land of France will be used as a means of attacking its allies with the consent of the Bordeaux government. All the resources of the French Empire and the French Navy will quickly fall into the hands of the enemy to serve their purposes. The British government firmly believes that no matter what happens, they will be able to continue the war on land, sea, and air and achieve victory. When Britain wins, it will assist the will of the French people regardless of the actions of the Bordeaux government. Britain's victory is the only possible hope for restoring the greatness of France and the freedom of its people. Currently, the brave people of other countries invaded by the Nazis are determined to fight for freedom, so the British government calls on all French people outside the enemy's power to rise up and help the British government carry out its work, so as to achieve more accurate and rapid results. The British government now appeals to all French people everywhere to fully assist the forces of liberation. This force is very great, and if it can be used faithfully and resolutely, it will surely overcome everything. (June 23rd, Reuters)</p>

<p>London: General de Gaulle, who served as Director of Tactics in the Reynaud cabinet, said in a French broadcast that the French government had not surrendered to the enemy, and that an armistice would amount to enslavement. The impact of the armistice conditions will be the surrender of our weapons, the complete occupation of all of France, and the reduction of the French government to a German and Italian appendage. Many French people will not accept these conditions. French people should continue to struggle, and everything that can be gathered in the army and in the methods of producing military equipment should be organized as much as possible where possible. I am in Britain to take charge of this national work. I have invited the leaders, Daladier, and French soldiers from the army, navy, and air force to contact me. I ask the French people to follow me.

<h3 id="e11">London Observer Reviews the Future of the Anglo-German War; Air Power and Sea Power Are Decisive Factors; British Military Strength Is Increasing <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>London: The Observer published an article by Gavin, entitled "Britain's Great War," which stressed the importance of air power and sea power in the future war for the British Isles. The article stated: "We have reached a battle of life and death. This war will test our entirety with firepower and prove our spirit. We will choose between invincible resistance and complete conquest by Nazi power. In one sense, we are now isolated, and in another sense, we are not. We have the sympathy of most of the people in the world, and most of its resources depend on sea power to obtain them. The longer we persist, the greater the actual assistance brought by the overseas empire and the United States will be. At the same time, the naval, land, and air forces we possess within these islands are stronger than ever before. As far as defending Britain is concerned, this military strength has not decreased due to the disasters suffered by the Low Countries and France, but has increased." The article mentioned Churchill's speech in the House of Commons and the report of the Special Consultant arguing that Britain should continue to fight, and then continued: "We must first concentrate on the necessary conditions he estimated. This is as clear as the sun. Adding air superiority to sea power is enough to form victory. There is nothing else that forms victory. Unless our air defenses have been destroyed, we cannot be defeated in the several months of persistent crisis. If Britain gains control of the skies a little later, it will be able to hold the winning ticket. We now have a new expeditionary force in the country, and have been through the experience of the Great War. The British expeditionary force in its land of origin is a priceless treasure. In addition, there are Canadian and Australian divisions who will coexist and die with Britain here. Are these things not enough to stir the blood of every man and every woman, and to call up the new army that is backing them up? Behind the new army is the local volunteer defense force. While our pilots are engaged in aerial combat, Britain will never be invaded by foreign troops at the end of summer. Why is this? Because its navy cannot be separated from all the rest. If Germany wants to attack any part of our land, it must do so with sufficient military force, and our sea power is sufficient to prevent Germany from safely crossing the sea with a sufficient large army to reach our shores."

<p>London: Some quarters here believed last night that if the French government succumbed to the harsh peace treaty of Germany and Italy, another new French government would be established outside France.

The Treaty of Versailles, based on force, has now been completely shattered along with the armistice agreement in Compiègne. The Treaty of Versailles violated justice and contained self-destructive factors from the beginning, and politicians after the war failed to revise it in time. France has adopted this attitude and is now suffering the consequences. It is not surprising that Germany is depriving France of its military potential. The preface to the current armistice agreement does not have the meaning of retaliation. (June 26th, Reuters)</p>

<p>Moscow Since the Soviet army entered the Baltic Sea countries, rumors have sprung up, claiming that the Soviet army's strength of one hundred or one hundred and fifty divisions has been concentrated on the borders of Lithuania and Germany. It is also said that the concentration of these troops is due to (1) the Soviet Union's resentment of Germany's success in Western Europe, (2) reflecting the deterioration of Soviet-German relations, and (3) proving that the Soviet Union intends to put pressure on Germany. Recently, the above-mentioned rumors have been found daily in newspapers of the United States, Japan, Britain, France, Turkey, and Sweden. TASS is now authorized by the government to declare that the rumors are completely inconsistent with the facts and are obviously absurd. In fact, the Soviet troops stationed in the Baltic Sea countries are not one hundred to one hundred and fifty divisions, but only eighteen to twenty divisions. Moreover, these troops are not stationed on the German-Lithuanian border, but are scattered throughout the Baltic Sea countries. Their purpose is to ensure the implementation of mutual assistance treaties between the Soviet Union and these countries, and there is absolutely no intention to put pressure on Germany. The Soviet authorities believe that those who spread the rumors have a special purpose: to undermine German-Soviet relations. These gentlemen are using their dreams to fabricate facts, but they do not know that since the signing of the non-aggression pact, the friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Germany cannot be shaken by any rumors. This kind of relationship is based on the fundamental interests of the Soviet Union and Germany, and is by no means a temporary friendship. (TASS dispatch on the 23rd)</p>

<p>Tokyo This morning, Japanese newspapers unanimously attacked the U.S. President's appointment of Stimson as Secretary of War, saying that this move will make U.S.-Japan relations increasingly worse. The Japan Times stated that the person selected by President Roosevelt is an enemy of Japan's Far East policy. Choosing such personnel is a clumsy method of revising the policy toward Europe. The Nichinichi Shimbun recalled Stimson's attitude toward Japan's occupation of Manchuria in 1931 when he was Secretary of State, saying that President Roosevelt's selection of such personnel shows the attitude of the United States. The Hochi Shimbun stated that Stimson's appointment as Secretary of War is a sign that the United States is preparing to deal with Japan with "military diplomacy." Miyako Shimbun, in commenting on the problem of U.S.-Japan relations, stated that if the United States really wants to improve relations with Japan, it should show its sincerity, conclude a treaty of commerce with Japan, and abandon its policy of being friendly with General Chiang Kai-shek.

The battle situation in western Xiangyang is particularly noted. It is said that the purpose of the Japanese army's attack on Yichang was to defeat the main force of the Chinese army in central China. However, to this day, the Japanese army has not yet discovered the location of the main force of the Chinese army, so it cannot complete its intended task, and the supply of the Japanese army is becoming increasingly difficult. In addition, because the Chinese army adopted an encirclement strategy and fiercely attacked the flanks and rear of the Japanese army, the initiative fell into the hands of the Chinese army again, and the Japanese army had to switch to a defensive posture, etc. Today, all Soviet newspapers carried Generalissimo Chiang's report at the Central Memorial Week.

<h3 id="e36">Japanese and Puppet Troops Invade Xujiahui Town; French Concession Remains Calm as Ever; Residents of Refugee Area Slightly Relocated Yesterday; Japanese Military Defenses in Shanghai Suburbs Abnormally Vacant <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>Xujiahui Town in Western Shanghai originally had the Xuhui Police Station of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, under the jurisdiction of the municipal government. It bordered the concession to the east, and extended to Lujia Road, a road built across the boundary to the north, the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway to the west, and Xietu Road to the south. Since the retreat of the National Army to the west, the French Concession took responsibility for maintaining order in the area, designated it as a French garrison area, and established a temporary police station at No. 77 Huizhan Street, Ciyou Road, Xujiahui, commonly known as the Refugee Area Police Station, to protect the [Xu Guangqi] Cathedral. Nearly three years have passed, and merchants and residents have lived in peace and prosperity. The market has become increasingly prosperous. More than 200 small factories have relocated from Nanshi and Zhabei to build houses on leased land in the area. However, rumors have been rampant in recent days, and residents have been relocating. The Refugee Area Police Station also relocated yesterday. The situation is very tense. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Residents Relocated in Droves Yesterday</p>
<p>Since the afternoon of the 18th of this month, a dispute arose between puppet police stationed at Jiaotong University and detectives from the French Concession Police over the issuance of bicycle licenses, resulting in a shooting. Rumors spread quickly, causing widespread panic. Yesterday, two armed Japanese military police suddenly patrolled the Hongqiao Road area of Tushanwan, Xujiahui, causing great alarm among residents, resulting in word spreading quickly and residents relocating in droves, with boxes and luggage constantly on the move. However, around 5 pm, the police department sent personnel to inform the citizens of the area not to believe the rumors, and the relocation trend subsided slightly.</p>
<p>Japanese Military Police Found in the Area</p>
<p>A reporter from the news agency patrolled the area for a week. At that time, Japanese military police in yellow uniforms, in groups of two, were seen on Tang Street West (i.e., Ciyou Road), Haig Road, Hongqiao Road, and the Tushanwan Triangle, a sight never seen before. To avoid friction, the French patrol police in the refugee area temporarily relocated from Huizhan Street at 4 pm yesterday.</p>
<p>Situation Calmed Down Last Night</p>
<p>To confirm the above news, a reporter from this newspaper drove to the area last night to investigate. When the car reached the intersection of Avenue Petain and Haig Road, it was suddenly stopped by a street patrolman. When asked about the reports of the Japanese and puppet troops invading the Xujiahui refugee area and the temporary relocation of the police station, shopkeepers nearby confirmed that it was true, and said that the trend of residents relocating had subsided slightly, and everything was quiet.</p>
<p>Japanese Military Defenses in Shanghai Suburbs Vacant</p>
<p>Over the past week, rumors have been rife in Shanghai that soldiers fully equipped with weapons have arrived in the areas surrounding Shanghai from Nanjing and other places. To clarify the actual situation, a reporter from the Daguan News Agency inquired with residents in the Shanghai suburbs. Currently, the Japanese military defenses in the four suburbs of Shanghai are still very vacant. Although some soldiers have arrived in the western suburbs of Shanghai, their numbers are very limited and they are stationed along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway. In the Nanshi area, only the so-called "Peace and National Salvation Army" drills are held daily in the former Ximen Public Sports Ground, but the number of people is only about one hundred, and they are all unarmed. Although there are traces of Japanese soldiers and tanks at the Japanese military police headquarters on Minguo Road, Xinjiao Street, and south of Jinji Bridge, this has been a common sight for years and is not worth emphasizing.</p>
<p>Situation Quiet on Roads Built Across the Boundary</p>
<p>To understand the actual situation in the area where roads have been built across the boundary in western Shanghai, a reporter from the Shangguang News Agency drove to inspect the area yesterday and found that there was no tense atmosphere. The Italian troops stationed in the Route Robert area were also carrying out patrol duties as usual, no different from before the declaration of war by Italy. At the intersection of Yuyuan Road and Kaixuan Road, a bunker was built by the British army, with British soldiers stationed inside and a British flag flying on top. The section of Anhe Temple Road along the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway is lined with wire mesh parallel to the railway. The situation is very quiet. The intersection of Lujia Road and Kaixuan Road is still guarded by two armed British soldiers standing at a guard post. The junction of the south with the French Concession is covered with barbed wire, and French soldiers are stationed there, with the British and French flags flying in the air, and the atmosphere is quite relaxed.</p>

The following is the announcement issued yesterday by Xie Shibai, the acting executive committee member of the area: Announcement regarding the matter of distributing rations. The association has been carrying out relief work for Chinese refugees for almost three years, and the amount of relief funds distributed each year is quite large. Now, due to the depletion of funds, it is impossible to continue. Before leaving Shanghai, Executive Committee Member Rao convened a meeting and decided to stop providing rations on June 20 and immediately disperse those who are registered. Subsequently, at the request of Director Gu, and out of compassion for the refugees, all rations have been extended to the end of this month, and each person is allowed to receive one month's ration as a dispersal fund. In addition to separately announcing the distribution method, this announcement is hereby issued to inform all refugees to comply with the order to disband and seek a livelihood. This is earnestly hoped. This is the announcement. Seal of Xie Shibai, Acting Executive Committee Member.</p>

<h3 id="e40">Flour Mills Decide to Operate as Usual; Solely for Local Sale; Aiming to Reduce the Severity of the Food Shortage; But All Losses Must Be Recovered from the Selling Price <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese flour milling industry stated that after the price of rice soared, flour became the staple food for the common people. Recent sales have surged from 3,000-5,000 bags to over 10,000 bags. However, the industry is facing the risk of being forced to shut down due to the depletion of imported wheat, the obstruction of new wheat, and the lack of raw materials. This would not only affect the industry itself but also impact the livelihood and security of the entire city. The industry reported to the municipal authorities and appealed to all sectors of society, but there was no concrete solution in practice. Therefore, yesterday, a general meeting was convened on the second floor of the Fuxin Flour Company on Jiangxi Road to discuss remedies. More than ten representatives from various factories, including Fufeng, Fuxin, Huafeng, and Xinlao, attended.</p>
<p>Relationship Between Wheat Prices and the Flour Industry</p>
<p>The following resolutions were made: (1) Regarding the proposal to supply the city to the greatest extent possible, it was resolved that the current amount of actual consumption would be supplied as usual, and all wholesalers and hoarders would be stopped from purchasing. (2) Regarding the proposal to restrict flour merchants from excessively raising prices, it was resolved to forward to all flour merchants that they must not raise the selling price beyond the wholesale price plus a reasonable commission. (3) and (4) Regarding the proposals to start receiving wheat and to send personnel from Zhuangpai to purchase wheat, it was resolved that, in the face of the adverse environment, the distribution should be temporarily suspended. Since it was difficult to initially lower the price of wheat to cover the cost of selling flour, it was decided to start purchasing from grain merchants and brokers at an increased fee. (5) and (6) Regarding the discussion of the proposals to suspend operations to wait for an opportunity and to increase the price of flour, it was resolved that, on the one hand, the mills would endure the difficulties and continue to operate to ensure the livelihoods of the workers and the preservation of their own property rights, and also to alleviate the severity of the city's food shortage. On the other hand, all losses would be reasonably factored into the selling price in the city to ensure that both parties are taken care of. Otherwise, if operations were suspended, it would be detrimental to the manufacturers, merchants, and citizens. It is reported that the resolutions made by the industry will be implemented immediately. Therefore, the rumors that the flour mills will suspend operations and reduce the supply can be dispelled, and the public's panic can be avoided.</p>
<p>Grain Committee to Hold Plenary Meeting Today</p>
<p>Recently, the price of rice in Shanghai has been soaring due to speculators taking advantage of the tense situation in Annam and the lack of rain. They have been raising the prices of rice that they had already transported to Shanghai at low prices, resulting in a surge in rice prices and instances of people rushing to buy rice. This is not only making it difficult for residents to maintain their livelihoods but also affecting social security. According to a reporter from Pingming News Agency who inquired with the Municipal Council, the Municipal Council's Grain Committee, in view of this situation and in order to stabilize the people's food supply, has scheduled a plenary committee meeting for 2:15 pm today (24th) to discuss important matters related to grains such as rice, wheat, and flour within the concession, and to come up with public methods that are sufficient to deter unscrupulous merchants and benefit the people. However, according to the opinions of the general public, in view of the fact that past price limits have been merely nominal and have not yielded real benefits, it is deeply hoped that the authorities will strictly enforce punishments and offer rewards for reporting illegal price increases, so that the price of rice will not be manipulated and can be suppressed.</p>
<h3 id="e41">Whether the Wenyi Liner Will Suspend Sailings Is Still Under Consideration; There Is Actually No Need to Suspend Sailings <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese side has repeatedly obstructed navigation to Wenzhou from Shanghai under the pretext of blockading the Oujiang River. Last month, they issued a warning to the British Consulate to prohibit British and American ships from entering the Oujiang River. Later, they restricted German and Italian ships over 100 tons from sailing to Wenzhou to the German and Italian Consulates. British and American ships, out of respect for international navigation rights, did not heed the warning, so all ships have continued to sail as usual. After receiving the notification from the Japanese side, the German and Italian Consulates notified the shipping companies accordingly. According to a reporter from Xinsheng News Agency, the rumor that the Baoli liner of the Italian Hua Yanghang was ordered to suspend sailing to Wenzhou yesterday was due to the above reasons. Currently, the German and Italian liners sailing between Shanghai and Wenzhou include the German Hanah, Feikang, and Haikang; and the Italian Baoli, Sant'Anna, Changde, and Maberria. Among them, only the Hanah, Feikang, and Baoli liners are over 200 tons. It is reported that the shipping companies have received the notification, but since there is actually no need to suspend sailings, whether to suspend them in the future is still under consideration. As for the other liners, they do not conflict with the restrictions and will continue to sail as usual. The Italian liner Maberria arrived in Shanghai yesterday and is scheduled to continue sailing to Wenzhou tomorrow. Therefore, there is no impact on the entire Shanghai-Wenzhou shipping.</p>

<p>Investigation into Hotel Embezzlement of Refugee Donations; The general manager of the Dafang Hotel on Zhengjia Muqiao Street in the French Concession, Mr. Shen Yongkang, embezzling refugee donations has aroused considerable public attention. It is heard that after the hotel industry proposed collecting refugee donations from passengers, hotels in the French Concession, due to certain reasons, have always allowed passengers to donate voluntarily. However, in order to prevent abuses, in addition to handing over the funds to the Refugee Association, any surplus is donated by the hotels themselves to other charities. Dafang Hotel has also adopted this method. The sudden occurrence of this incident is said to be due to other reasons. It is reported that Shen has collected evidence and will make it public in order to clarify the truth.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the prices of fresh pork in the British and French Concessions of Shanghai rose again, with different prices. It is generally believed that the sudden rise in pork prices was obviously due to Japanese manipulation. According to people in the pork industry, the supply of goods here has been greatly reduced, and those in the pork industry in the two concessions are practically not allowed to trade at the "Livestock Market" in Hongkou. The handlers in the Hongkou "Market" must demand tips, so the cost of pork is high and the selling price increases accordingly. However, according to official claims from the Public Concession, it is indeed a fact that the supply of pigs has been lacking recently, but foreign goods will be available soon, and the selling price of fresh meat is expected to fall.</p>

<h3 id="e45">Provincial Security Team Advances East; Has Broken Through the Taihu Lake Area; Deputy Commander Cai Runqi Leads Troops Out of the Mountains; Dingshan Completely Recovered; More Than 1,000 Japanese Killed <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>According to people from Wuxi who have come to Shanghai, the former Jiangnan Advance Army originally operated in the area of Suxi Cheng Yu. They were frequently attacked by the Japanese and puppet forces. Since being ordered to reorganize into the Provincial Security Team and entering the mountains for training, more than a year has passed. It is learned that the troops, led by Deputy Commander Cai Runqi, advanced east and engaged in a large-scale positional battle with the Japanese army in the Dingshan area. The two sides were locked in a stalemate for two months, and after several assaults, more than 1,000 Japanese were killed, and Dingshan was completely recovered. Cai then took advantage of the victory to pursue the enemy and broke through Taihu Lake. In the Zhouqiao area of the Xiyi Road, they encountered a large Japanese reinforcement and immediately ambushed them, destroying more than ten trucks and killing hundreds of Japanese. Later, they encountered Japanese and puppet troops in Yangshuyuan, Wuxi, and fought fiercely for four days. The small branch of Japanese and puppet troops collapsed and retreated. Now a part of Cai's troops has been transferred to the designated area. The Japanese and puppet forces, hearing that Cai led his troops to return, and in view of his past combat capabilities and the current strong strength and complete equipment, are extremely alarmed.</p>
<h3 id="e46">Zhejiang Province Lifts Rice Ban; Scope of Lifting Still Being Inquired <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>After the relief association of seven counties in Shaoxing residing in Shanghai requested Zhejiang Province to lift the rice ban in order to provide relief to the rice shortage in Shaoxing, it is learned that Zhejiang Province's reply telegram arrived in Shanghai on the 21st, approving the lifting of the rice ban. However, the association, unable to understand whether this only refers to relief rice or also allows merchants to purchase freely, inquired again on the 21st. The association stated that if Zhejiang Province's lifting of the rice ban is limited to relief rice, the association will immediately send personnel with funds to purchase rice from Zhejiang Province to provide relief to Shaoxing. If the telegram approves rice merchants to freely purchase and transport rice from Jiangxi, the purchase can be entrusted to local traders. The association must first advance a large sum of money. The association believes that, given the tense situation in Vietnam, the purchase of foreign rice is not easy and the price is high, so it requested the provincial government to lift the rice ban. Now that it has been approved, it is expected that the rice situation in Shaoxing can be slightly alleviated with the cooperation of the government and the people.</p>
<p>Silk and Dyeing Industries</p>
<p>The Shanghai Silk and Satin Dyeing Industry Association, in view of the fact that the source of rice for Shaoxing and Xiaoshan is running out, and the unprecedented drought has led to starvation everywhere, has each made donations at the general meeting of members on the 10th, which was extremely enthusiastic. Therefore, the 11th board meeting decided to establish a Shaoxing-Xiaoshan Emergency Relief Committee, and proposed that the association's member factories and workshops deduct 2% of their operating income each month as a regular relief donation until the disaster situation is alleviated. A general meeting of members was held at 7 pm yesterday (22nd) at the association's premises in Dean Lane, North Shanxi Road.</p>
<p>Transporting Rice to Zidong</p>
<p>Pudong, Nanhui, and Fengxian have always been rice-producing areas. Due to the prolonged drought, rice prices rose slightly. However, since the recent rainfall in the four suburbs of Shanghai, the panic over the severe drought has long been eliminated. However, the recent rice prices are still similar to those in Shanghai, because local unscrupulous merchants colluded with Ding Xishan's puppet troops to forcibly purchase rice from Pudong at a price of 30 to 40 yuan per dan and transport it to the Xiaoshan area of Zidong to make huge profits.</p>
<h3 id="e47">Lawyers Association Plans to Offer Group Life Insurance; Circular Already Sent to All Members; Will Be Implemented If Approved <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Lawyers Association, with a large membership of approximately 1,200, and an average age of under 40, has an annual mortality rate that is not precisely statistically known, but is estimated to be around 24 people per year. However, most members do not pay attention to savings, leading to poverty after death, even if [they have the help of friends].</p>
<p>Rising Cost of Living</p>
<p>Everyone's finances are often stretched, and even if they are willing to contribute, the amount is limited. Lawyer Xu Ziliang, a member of the association's standing committee, in order to remedy this deficiency, advocated offering a group life insurance policy to members and submitted a plan to the association's 54th board meeting for approval. Circulars have been sent to all members to seek their opinions. If the majority approves, it can be implemented. The main points of the group insurance plan are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Insurance Type: Whole life insurance, meaning that if the insured person dies for any reason (other than accidental causes such as suicide or assassination), the policy will be mature and the compensation will be paid immediately, so that the funds can be used for compensation purposes. The payment period is longer and the premium is cheaper than savings insurance. (2) Insurance Amount: To be determined by the Group Insurance Committee, but it will be 1,000 yuan. (3) Insured Persons and Age: All members of the association must fully join the insurance, and there are no restrictions on age. Since they are members of the association, they should all enjoy the benefits of insurance and there should be no discrimination based on age. (4) Premiums: The association currently has more than 1,200 members, and the average age is under 40. Although there are no precise statistics on the annual mortality rate, based on memories, in recent years, the number of members who have died from natural causes has averaged no more than 24 per 1,000 people per year. According to this plan, the association will have to pay approximately 24,000 yuan in compensation each year. If this amount is shared by 1,200 people, each person will only be responsible for 20 yuan per year, which is 1 yuan and 6 jiao and 7 fen per month. Therefore, it is proposed to collect an insurance premium of 1 yuan and 7 jiao per person per month, which will result in an annual insurance premium of 24,480 yuan. If this amount is added to the interest, even if the mortality rate of members exceeds the above figures in the future, the association will not suffer a huge loss.</p>

Afterwards, Wang Er took a public bus back and reported the car robbery to the Jing'an Temple Police Station. As of 2 am this morning, the car had not been found.</p>

<p>Since the start of the war of resistance, many residents of the isolated island have gone to the inland areas to serve in the army. A reporter from Datong News Agency has specifically recorded the transportation conditions from Shanghai to Chongqing as follows: Take a ship from Shanghai to Ningbo, then take a steamship to Jiangkou, then to Xikou, then take a car to Yuhua, and then take a train to Yingze on the next day, then take a car to Hengyang (passing through Nancheng, Ningdu, Ji'an, Jiehualong, etc.). From Hengyang, take a train to Guilin, then take a car to Liuzhou (Hengyang can originally be reached directly by train, since the fall of Nanning, it has been suddenly blocked, travelers can inquire about the route at the time of travel). From Liuzhou, take a car to Guiyang, and then take a car directly from Guiyang to Chongqing (there was originally a waterway from Guilin to Chongqing, but the fighting in Guanchang is currently fierce and it is impossible to pass through). There are two problems for travel today: one is the scarcity of vehicles, and the other is the heavy military transport. The journey takes about 20 days, and the travel cost is 350 yuan (including food and accommodation).</p>

<p>Monosodium glutamate</p>
<p>The "MSG" flavoring powder produced by Tianchu MSG Factory has been on the market for many years and has been registered with various competent authorities. Recently, the company discovered that a similar product named "Wei Jing" was being sold in the city, manufactured by the Xiangyuan Factory opened by Liu Xiangyuan of Yongren, No. 15 Zunde Lane, Xiamen Road. The color, pattern, and style of the iron cans used for the Wei Jing were almost completely copied from the MSG style. Therefore, the Tianchu Factory entrusted lawyers Wang Yaotang and Xian Xingzhong to investigate with the Trademark Bureau whether the Wei Jing had been registered. The reply stated that it had not been legally registered and could be prosecuted according to the law. The Tianchu Factory, represented by Deputy Manager Xiang Hongchang and lawyers Wang and Qian, reported to the Laoza Gate Police Station and requested an investigation. After reporting to the First Special Court, a search warrant was issued.

<h3 id="e56">Wang Ningwa, a Young Girl, Sues for Inheritance: Siblings Litigate, Officials Urge Reconciliation <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>Wang Ningwa, a 22-year-old woman from Nanhui, is the granddaughter of Wang Yonglin, a wealthy man from Pudong. After "8813", Wang Yonglin and his wife died in Shanghai one after another. The estate of over 400,000 yuan was managed separately by his son Wang Yizhi (Ningwa's uncle) and his grandson Wang Jingren (Ningwa's brother). Wang Ningwa feared that her inheritance would be encroached upon, so she recently hired lawyer Shen Xingxia to file a lawsuit in the First Special Court's Civil Court, requesting confirmation of her one-sixth inheritance right to the entire estate of Wang Yonglin and his wife. She also requested that the defendants Wang Yizhi and Wang Jingren hand over 600-700 mu of land and houses and cash that they each received as gifts during the separation in 1919, as well as 49 mu of dowry land and 10,000 gold coins that Gu Wangzhengan (Wang Yizhi's sister) received when she got married, and include them in Wang Yonglin's estate for equal distribution. Furthermore, the hundreds of mu of land for Wang Yonglin's retirement, the shares of Jihong and other pawnshops, and tens of thousands of yuan of shares of Zhengxiang Qianzhuang, along with deposits in various banks and more than 20 boxes, should also be divided into one-sixth. After receiving the lawsuit, the court summoned both parties for a hearing yesterday. Both parties appointed lawyers to appear in court. First, lawyer Shen Xingxia, representing the plaintiff Wang Ningwa, stated the facts and reasons for the lawsuit, and said that the defendant had once offered more than 20,000 yuan for reconciliation, but it was too far from the amount that the plaintiff should inherit, so the reconciliation failed. Then, the lawyer representing the defendants Wang Jingren and others replied that Wang Yonglin's estate had been distributed by himself during his lifetime and could not be changed at present. Then, Shen Dizhuang, the manager of Zhengxiang Qianzhuang, testified that Wang Yonglin had no deposits in the bank. Lawyer Shen Xingxia then presented evidence, and Shen Dizhuang admitted that Wang Yonglin had 20,000 yuan in deposits, but most of it had been withdrawn. The court said to both parties that the case was about a family dispute, and reconciliation was the best way, so it was announced that the date would be changed and witnesses would be called again for questioning.</p>

<h3 id="e62">Letter to the Editor <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>To the Editor: The news in your newspaper for several days that Shen Yongkang, the general manager of Dafang Hotel on Zhengjia Bridge Street, embezzled refugee donations and was fined 5,000 yuan is absolutely untrue. Although I am a shareholder of Dafang, I only serve as a resident member of the board of directors and have never held the position of general manager. Moreover, Dafang's internal organization does not have the title of general manager. The highest authority is the board of directors elected by the shareholders' meeting. All matters related to business must be approved by the board of directors before they can be implemented. No individual can be in charge. As for the use of donations, it is also decided by the board of directors. Even if I am unscrupulous, how dare I take such a great risk and tamper with it? The news reports are obviously deliberately slanderous and spread this kind of atmosphere. In addition to starting an investigation and publishing the use of donations, I would like to briefly describe the situation and hope that you will correct it to clarify the facts. I am very grateful. Sincerely, Shen Yongkang, June 23rd.</p>

<p>(Hong Kong Correspondence) The Geneva-based World Student Service Association, organized by educators from universities around the world, has expressed deep sympathy for China's war of resistance and is helping university students in the war zones or occupied areas in China. To show that they will not stop helping due to their own difficulties, they sent letters to universities across China, expressing stronger support in the future. The original letters have been received in Hong Kong. A translation of the essence of the letter is as follows: "To the students of Chinese universities: Since the beginning of your country's war of resistance, countless solemn and splendid academic institutions have been destroyed by the Japanese. However, professors and students, despite being displaced and experiencing hardship, have never succumbed to difficulties and forgotten their sacred mission. They continue to work hard and strive to regenerate and use steadfast courage to lay the foundation for your renaissance. Your students, in this belief, go forward courageously, proving the inherent spirit of hard work and learning since ancient times, and revealing the hope of the new world. This has aroused the admiration and moved the educators of the world. Our association was founded in 1920 in response to the needs after the First European War. At that time, we did our best to help European students. In the same spirit, we express our deep sympathy to your students. Since 7/7, we have continuously spread information about education in your country to the world, maintained close contact with student groups in various countries, and raised funds to help. It is estimated that there are now universities in thirty-seven countries that are vigorously shielding your country's struggle for national survival and donating money to express their sympathy. Today, the problem of China is equal to the problem of Europe. The second outbreak in Europe, rumours are rampant, but there are few that continue to pursue their studies. European students are not discouraged by this, but their organization is becoming stronger and their struggle is becoming more vigorous to maintain the foundation and purpose of their studies. Now, the misfortune of European universities is the same as in China. Although the eastern and western hemispheres are geographically different, what they encounter will eventually be solved. European students deeply feel that they will not stop helping your students because of their own difficulties."</p>

<p>The Hezong Cup Charity Basketball Invitational Tournament, which is being prepared to raise funds for the education of orphaned children, has announced the full list of competition committee members yesterday after Mr. Zhou Jiaqi came forward to preside over the competition matters. The chairman of the committee is Zhou Jiaqi, and the members are Qu Honglu, Lu Zhong'en, Wen Zongyuan, and Zheng Zhifang, totaling five people. The first meeting of the competition committee will be held tomorrow afternoon at 6:00 PM in the Rongsheng Society of the Paramount Hotel on Yu Yuan Road.

However, the registered teams still need to undergo a review by the competition committee tomorrow night to determine the selection. The original limit was for ten teams, but according to the current situation, it seems that it cannot be expanded. Therefore, the organizer intends to expand to twelve teams because it will be difficult to accommodate more due to time constraints. At the same time, if they are divided into two groups, it will be difficult to concentrate the excitement. Now, in addition to the championship trophy donated by Mr. Zhu Dazhu, the Chinese general manager of Hezong Automobile Company, Mr. Ma Xiangsheng, the general manager of Jinmen Grand Theater, donated a large silver cup yesterday, designated as the runner-up trophy.

<h3 id="e77">A Humble Opinion Regarding Whether Capital Verification for Limited Companies Should Be Subject to Government Registration <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>— Gong Maode</p>
<p>The Necessity of Capital Verification</p>
<p>A limited liability company (hereinafter referred to as "company") is a company formed by seven or more shareholders with limited liability. Shareholders bear no further liability; even if the company's assets are insufficient to pay off debts in the future, creditors have no right to claim payment of debts from the company's shareholders. Therefore, in a limited liability company, the total guarantee for the company's debts is only the company's total assets.</p>
<p>Considering that the initial form of a company's assets is the capital paid by shareholders, including cash and other assets that can be legally used to offset capital contributions, it is essential to verify whether the first installment of capital has been fully paid when the company is established or increases its capital. When assets other than cash are used to offset capital contributions, it is crucial to ensure the type, price, and number of shares allocated by the company are appropriate. This directly affects the company's actual assets and is related to the strength of the guarantee for the company's debts. Therefore, it is necessary to verify these matters before the company applies for establishment registration or capital increase registration. This verification work is commonly known as "capital verification."</p>
<p>Regarding capital verification, Article 91 of the Company Law stipulates: "After taking office, a director shall immediately request the competent authority to select an inspector to verify whether the first installment of capital has been fully paid and whether the following matters are accurate:</p>
<p>(1) For those using assets other than cash to offset capital contributions, the name of the contributor, the type and price of the assets, and the number of shares allocated by the company;</p>
<p>(2) The establishment expenses to be borne by the company and the amount of remuneration to be received by the promoters."</p>
<p>Article 103 stipulates: "The directors and supervisors shall investigate the following matters and report to the incorporation meeting:</p>
<p>(1) Whether the total number of shares has been fully subscribed;</p>
<p>(2) Whether the first installment of capital has been fully paid by each subscriber;</p>
<p>(3) Whether the matters listed in Article 89, Paragraph 3, and Article 91 are accurate.</p>
<p>If the directors and supervisors are selected from among the promoters, the incorporation meeting may elect other inspectors to conduct the aforementioned investigation and report."</p>
<p>Article 194 stipulates: "The supervisors shall investigate the following matters and report to the shareholders' meeting:</p>
<p>(1) Whether the newly issued shares have been fully subscribed;</p>
<p>(2) Whether the first installment of capital for each new share has been fully paid;</p>
<p>(3) If assets other than cash are used to offset capital contributions, whether the number of shares allocated is appropriate.</p>
<p>For the aforementioned investigation and report, the shareholders' meeting may elect inspectors."</p>
<p>Advantages of Capital Verification by Competent Authorities</p>
<p>Based on the content of Articles 91, 103, and 194 of the Company Law (listed in the previous section), we can see that companies established by promoters must have their capital verified by the competent authority. Companies established by solicitation have their capital verified by inspectors elected by the directors, supervisors, or shareholders' meeting. When a company increases its capital, the capital is verified by the supervisors or other elected inspectors. Although all these are types of capital verification, the entities responsible for verification are different. It is difficult to make an accurate judgment on the relative merits of various capital verification systems based solely on theory. However, based on past facts, the competent authority's position of strict supervision leads to the most credible verification results, which is undeniable.</p>
<p>The so-called "capital verification" is to check the sufficiency of a company's capital. Specifically, it refers to verifying whether the shares have been fully subscribed, whether the first installment of capital has been fully paid, and whether the number of shares allocated by the company when assets other than cash are used to offset capital contributions is appropriate. It is inappropriate for shareholders who have paid capital contributions, subscribed to shares, or allocated shares to conduct the verification themselves, to prevent bias and fraud. Therefore, to thoroughly implement the task of capital verification, it must be carried out by a third party other than the shareholders. However, if the third party is an inspector elected by the shareholders' meeting, the elected inspector is often closely related to some or all of the company's shareholders, or their interests are aligned with the entire company. This leads to a biased attitude in their inspection, favoring related shareholders or companies with aligned interests, which is only natural. Thus, the reliability of the inspection report is questionable. Who, then, is the most appropriate person to conduct the verification? The competent authority is the first choice. The competent authority is entrusted by the people of the country to handle matters within its jurisdiction, with the protection of the interests of all people as its highest ideal. Its relationship with companies, shareholders, and the general public is impartial, so its position is fair and its status is detached. Its verification report is, of course, the most reliable and without doubt.</p>
<p>Disadvantages of Capital Verification by Directors, Supervisors, or Inspectors</p>
<p>The disadvantages of capital verification by directors, supervisors, or inspectors were rarely discovered before the implementation of the profit-seeking enterprise income tax. However, since the introduction of the income tax, they have gradually become apparent. Because the profit-seeking enterprise income tax is levied based on the percentage of income to capital, and only one-third of the public reserve is allowed to be included in the capital calculation, some opportunistic entrepreneurs inevitably exploit the provision that companies established by solicitation do not need to apply to the competent authority for capital verification. They deliberately overstate the paid-up capital at the time of establishing the company, creating opportunities for tax evasion in the future.</p>
<p>As for already established companies, some, recognizing the lack of fairness in the current taxation standards, have implemented capital increases to achieve a more reasonable income tax burden. Most companies implementing capital increases follow stable and legal procedures. However, in reality, it is undeniable that some companies use the fact that capital increase registration does not require capital verification by the competent authority and employ various improper tricks to artificially inflate nominal capital (registered capital).</p>
<p>When these companies apply for establishment registration or capital increase registration, the Ministry of Economic Affairs may have already discerned the falsehood, but due to the limitations of its authority, it cannot obtain concrete evidence. If the registration requirements are met, it can only approve the application. However, if the number of such companies continues to increase, not only will the state's tax revenue suffer significant losses, but the interests of bona fide third parties (creditors and the general public) will also be permanently impaired. To protect the interests of the state and the people, the emergence of such companies must be prevented.</p>
<p>Remedial Measures</p>
<p>To prevent limited liability companies from falsely reporting capital, the most effective way is to stipulate that limited liability companies applying for establishment registration...</p>
<h3 id="e78">Speculation on the Future of Rice Prices: Anniversary of the Rice Panic <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>— Bao Leti</p>
<p>The rice stored in the hands of hoarders has already been replaced with new rice before the mold season. Rice prices have started to rise sharply again. This is happening around the same time as last year, creating a sense of the anniversary of the rice panic. Furthermore, there are various excuses, making the surge even more dramatic. However, price trends are always related to supply and demand. The speculative profits of those who hoard and manipulate the market only benefit those who sell first. If you want to profit from hoarding, your financial luck this year will be very different from the past. Last year, hoarders profited because rice prices started to rise from a low base, so everything went smoothly. Now, the base is already too high, and this calculation will not work. No matter how essential rice is as a food, when the river rises to the level of the levees, it will overflow. It won't rise above the levees. After all, general purchasing power will restrain price trends. It's hard to be abstract, but the principle is unbreakable. Therefore, in this article, I will put aside the issues of morality and government control and only consider the rice merchants' desire for wealth. Can current rice prices hold?</p>
<p>Clearing Up the Reasons for the Rise</p>
<p>A prolonged drought indicates a disaster, and the rice shortage in eastern Zhejiang has affected Shanghai, so it seems that the rice price increase is inevitable. But this is not the case.</p>
<p>(1) There are still more than twenty days before the start of the mold season (July 15th in the Gregorian calendar). Who can guarantee that there will be a severe drought this year? The severity of the drought in 1934 was many times greater than today. There was no rain at all during the mold season, and the rainfall in June, July, and August was extremely low. The high temperatures at that time broke the high record of the past sixty years. Everyone thought there would be a severe drought. But that year, there was still a 60-70% harvest, and the most expensive rice price was only about 11 yuan per stone. Moreover, there has been rain in central Yangtze River area, and the current pressure change is a precursor to the coming of rain.</p>
<p>(2) Eastern Zhejiang has a thin rice yield, so famine occurs every year, and it has always been supplemented by transportation from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui. This year will be no exception. Everyone in the industry knows this. Using the rice shortage in eastern Zhejiang as an excuse for hoarding can only deceive outsiders. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's telegram ordering disaster relief and Yu Qiaqing's telegram discussing the matter both come from the common sentiment of concern for one's hometown. Now, they are actually being used by rice bugs as reasons to raise prices, which is really heartbreaking! (I think this type of document should not be made public, to avoid being exploited.)</p>
<p>(3) The coastal defense was once blocked, and Hong Kong also banned rice exports, so the source of foreign rice seems to be a problem. However, transportation to Burma and Siam is unimpeded. The economy of Annam relies entirely on rice exports. The blockade is at most temporary and not a long-term solution, especially since it has now been lifted. When the Bean and Rice Industry Association wrote to the concession authorities yesterday, it said that if the Hong Kong ban "is not urgently addressed, I am afraid that the price surge will be difficult to stop." In fact, Hong Kong is not a rice-producing area. Although Nanyang ships all pass through Hong Kong, the Hong Kong ban does not hinder the transport of foreign rice to Shanghai. Although Shanghai has a lot of foreign rice handled by Hong Kong merchants, the transport goes directly from the production area to Shanghai and does not go through Hong Kong warehouses first. Even if it exists, the number must be very small. However, it is always good for Hong Kong to lift the ban and restore free trade. But the ban or lack thereof has nothing to do with rice prices. The association's statement is difficult to justify. Now that the coastal defense blockade has been lifted and rice merchants have lost their basis for raising prices, the association's remarks seem to be handing people ammunition, which is a pity.</p>
<p>(4) Japan is experiencing a rice shortage and is coming to China to search for rice to supplement its supplies. However, it is an exaggeration to say that this will cause a shortage of domestic rice. According to the recent survey report released by the Japan Rice Countermeasures Council, the total amount of rice supplied in Japan this year is 78 million stone, and the total amount needed is 83 million stone, so the supply is short by 10 million stone. However, according to Japanese Agriculture Minister Shimada's report to the House of Representatives, the amount of rice supplied this year, including existing rice and already scheduled imports of Siamese rice, totals 100 million stone. In this case, there is a surplus. Regardless of which is true, if they really come to China to purchase, the degree will not be as great as most people imagine.</p>
<p>(5) The Japanese army in China is eating local rice, which is indeed another root cause of the increase in domestic rice consumption. However, the casualties of the population during wartime may offset this. The rural population in China has always been excessive. Even today, there is still plenty of rural labor, so there is no problem in production. Moreover, the current surge in rice prices has implicitly encouraged farmers to increase rice fields and increase rice production. It can be anticipated that the supply of rice this year will be much greater than normal.</p>
<p>(6) In war zones, farmers stop farming, which is indeed a major threat to production. However, Chinese farmers are calm and courageous, unmatched in the world. When soldiers arrive, they flee; when soldiers leave, they continue farming. During the Shanghai war, farming in the suburbs of Shanghai continued as usual, which is clear evidence of this. Furthermore, according to the National Government Agricultural Foundation's survey report, in 1938, rice production still accounted for 81% of the 1937 level. At that time, the war was taking place in rice-producing areas, and the harvest was still so good. Moreover, the war has now moved to mountainous areas, which does not hinder farming.</p>
<p>(7) Although Shanghai is not a rice-producing area, it is the distribution center for the rice-producing areas of the country. Although the wartime situation has changed slightly, there is still a background of rice fields in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui with an annual output of about 30 million stone. The total population of the three provinces is at most 70 million, and the amount needed is at most 200 million, so the supply is obviously more than enough. The Shanghai rice market is responsible for supplying the entire country. Now, it only supplies Shanghai and the surrounding area. In any case, the supply will not be insufficient.</p>
<p>(8) Japan monopolizes the transportation and sale of rice in the producing areas, so the supply of domestic rice to Shanghai seems to be a problem. But Japan's main purpose in monopolizing is to make a profit, which is one of their means of "using war to support war." If the transport of rice to Shanghai is cut off, the economy of farmers in the interior will inevitably go bankrupt. The bankruptcy of Chinese farmers would be pleasing to Japan, but they would lose their means of plunder. Under their purpose of "using war to support war," this is impossible. Currently, most of the ports along the Yangtze River and the coast have fallen, except for Shanghai and Ningbo. Is it that the Japanese army is especially kind to the people of Shanghai and Ningbo? No, they are only leaving this to facilitate their plunder. Knowing this, it can be said with certainty that Japan will not cut off the transport of rice from the interior to Shanghai.</p>
<p>The Situation of the Rice Industry</p>
<p>General price trends are always controlled by the supply and demand of the goods themselves and the strength of social purchasing power. As mentioned above, there is no basis for rice prices to continue to rise. Why is there such a sharp rise now? In a word: the rice bugs are celebrating their anniversary, creating a new high standard to alleviate the current difficulties in their business. If prices do not rise, it will be difficult for the Japanese puppet regime to develop new ways to plunder. This is the cause of today's situation. The people's food is sacrificed, but they will also reap what they sow. Let me be presumptuous again and briefly describe the cause and effect.</p>
<p>In early May of last year, rice prices were still under the price limit of 14 yuan. At that time, the Japanese puppet regime's indirect exploitation was limited to the difference between the price in the producing area and the price in Shanghai. Otherwise, traders would hesitate, and the Japanese puppet regime would have no way to plunder. At this time, the price in the producing area, the price in Shanghai, and the Japanese puppet regime's amount of plunder were all maintained in equilibrium. There was peace for about two years.</p>
<p>The prices of everything in Shanghai have risen, but the rice industry alone is subject to price limits. This is very unfair!" So the rice firms first raised the wholesale price to 14 　, while allowing rice shops to sell at a retail price of a few cents above the 14 yuan limit. The price limit was like a hymen. Once broken, there was no restraint, and rice prices began to soar. The Japanese puppet regime's amount of indirect plunder also increased, and the price of rice in the producing area also rose rapidly. In this cycle of rising prices, Shanghai rice merchants, rice merchants in the producing areas, rice traders, and the Japanese puppet regime's indirect plunderers all made a fortune. But Shanghai rice prices soared past the price of foreign rice, so Shanghai rice merchants could no longer raise prices, because domestic rice was too expensive, which made foreign rice sell well. This is the reason why Shanghai rice prices have been stable recently, and it is also the beginning of the Shanghai rice industry's desire for wealth being restrained. Because his raw materials were already high, there was no way to get a huge profit without raising prices.</p>
<p>Although Shanghai rice prices are limited by foreign rice prices, the price of rice in the producing areas is still rising. The closer the price in the producing area is to the price in Shanghai, the less the profit that the Japanese puppet regime can extort. So, under the guise of "stabilizing food in the occupied areas," the Japanese puppet regime began to control rice prices in the occupied areas. The price of rice in the producing areas cannot continue to rise freely. For example, in Suzhou, it was once suppressed at a price limit of 20 yuan per stone. At that time, the price in Shanghai was above 40 yuan, so the Japanese puppet regime's extortion could reach a huge profit of 15 to 20 yuan. This is the beginning of the price of rice in the producing areas being restrained by violence.</p>
<p>Shanghai rice prices are suppressed by foreign rice prices, and foreign rice prices are suppressed by black market exchange rates, while the price of rice in the producing areas is suppressed by the gun. But the Japanese puppet regime can still adjust its extortion rate according to the rise and fall of foreign rice prices. The profits of Shanghai rice bugs, rice bugs in the producing areas, and rice traders are wiped out by the Japanese puppet regime. This is the retribution for their help. Although it is self-inflicted, their current business is indeed difficult. At this point, they should wake up and launch a joint counterattack against the indirect plunderers to survive. But they insist on repeating the same mistake and continue to attack consumers.</p>
<p>When the 52 black market exchange rate turmoil occurred, the rice bugs were complacent. Foreign rice prices rose sharply, and domestic rice followed. However, the exchange market turmoil quickly subsided, and black market exchange rates gradually rose again. The rice market price surge was suppressed. Not wanting to be reconciled, the rice shortage in eastern Zhejiang suddenly sounded an alarm. A good opportunity was hard to come by, so they expanded their use of it. They also used threats such as drought and the coastal defense blockade, so the era of foreign rice leading domestic rice changed to a new era of domestic rice leading foreign rice. Now, they are still spreading rumors, claiming how much rice prices will rise in the future. They have the ambition to follow Germany's psychological warfare strategy and implement their preemptive strategy. But there is no basis for this. So, the higher the rice price is pushed up, the greater the danger in the future. As long as there is heavy rain and people are comforted, a price drop is inevitable. So, the sooner you sell, the safer you are. If you tighten the grip and don't let go, you will inevitably become more rigid and be scolded by others! What could be more unwise?</p>

<h3 id="e79">Finance: Weekly Review of Foreign Exchange <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>According to the Shanghai Economic Consulting Institute's report, since the dramatic changes in the exchange market on May 2, the lowest prices were US$4.5 and £3.125. Afterwards, they gradually increased. On Saturday, the closing prices were US$6.03125 and £3.90625. According to market rumors, the factors causing the fluctuations are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Local Panic, (2) French Armistice, (3) Silver Agreement, (4) Southern Advance Policy, (5) Invitation of Mr. Stimson to the Cabinet, (6) Rumors of Mr. Song Flying to the US and Issuance of Treasury Bills, (7) Exchange Stabilization Fund Buying.</p>
<p>The reasons for local panic are the intensification of the Southern Advance Policy and the military failures of the Allied Powers. If the Southern Advance Policy is implemented, international trade will become more difficult, but the actual need for foreign exchange will decrease with the reduction of imports. The market price may turn flat. Regarding Shanghai's position, people's views differ. Some view economics as more important than politics, while others view politics as more important than economics. The former raises calves to fatten themselves and will not resort to violence. The latter preserves what is left and should strive to maintain it. The so-called panic is merely a psychological effect. Although France has made peace, the possibility of Britain continuing to fight is still high. The US, due to its increased aid, may become more easily embroiled in the war. Even if Germany and Italy continue to dominate, when they acquire substantial colonies, their resources will increase, and production will be abundant. The Far East will still be a very good market for them to dump goods. At that time, the possibility of maintaining the balance of power in East Asia will be greater, which will benefit China's monetary system. The Tianjin silver problem has been rumored for a long time. Although it has been resolved now, it does not seem to have given the market much of a stimulus. Moreover, the Tianjin blockade has been lifted, and the future of the concessions seems to be able to maintain the status quo, so the exchange market may not change drastically. Mr. Stimson's appointment as Secretary of War symbolizes that the US will actively aid countries that have been invaded. This is because Mr. Stimson's remarks have always advocated justice. Now that he has been brought into the cabinet, it is believed that the isolationist faction has lost its power. The US is preparing to organize a coalition government in preparation for intervention in the war. Although it is difficult to predict where it will lead, at a time when the Southern Advance Policy is rampant, it is necessary to strike back at those who are striking. Therefore, the future of the fiat currency can be viewed optimistically. Mr. Song is a powerful proponent of sound fiscal policies. Now he has decided to fly to the US. Although his mission is unclear, it is expected that this trip will be fruitful. As for the issuance of treasury bills, it is related to monetary reform, which may not be permitted by the current environment.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is the responsibility of the Exchange Stabilization Fund to buy and sell according to the rise and fall of exchange rates. However, the general public softens because of its buying, which is probably due to a misunderstanding of the nature of the Exchange Stabilization Fund's buying compared to retail investors and speculators. When the Exchange Stabilization Fund buys to a certain extent, it will maintain a certain level. The more it buys, the more abundant its funds will be, and the stronger its ability to maintain a certain level will be. However, at a time when the international situation is changing rapidly, it is more beneficial for the Exchange Stabilization Fund to maintain a natural level.</p>

<p>— Hui</p>
<p>—May— (1)</p>
<p>Shanghai's commodity prices in May were greatly affected by the sharp contraction of the black market exchange rate on the 2nd, leading to a rampant price surge.

<h3 id="e87">A Short Preface to Climbing Danya Mountain <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Danya Mountain in Taizhou is located between Tiantai and Yandang Mountains. According to legend, Ge Hong, also known as Ge Zhichuan, from the Jin Dynasty, refined elixirs here. The traces of his immortality, such as the bald-tailed snails, scaleless crucian carp, red shrimp, and purple crabs, were all foods he cooked and discarded on the ground, and they still thrive in the ponds today. Also, the Immortal Bed Stone Chamber is where he set up his furnace and practiced alchemy. The tall trees on the mountain pierce the sky, and the blood vines coil around the streams. The golden starry stones shine all over the ground, all being rare objects. Starting from the first month of Dingchou year, the mountain people began constructing pavilions and towers, repairing ridges, ponds, embankments, and bridges, and planting flowers and trees extensively. By the Double Ninth Festival of last year, the project was completed. Hundreds of famous scholars were invited to climb the mountain, compose poems, play music with lanterns, and hold a grand banquet. The cassia trees were in full bloom that day, and the golden cassia blossoms in the lunar palace seemed to be waiting to add to the mountain people's enjoyment. The dignitaries present appreciated and praised the extraordinary event! The poems composed at the time caused a sensation far and wide. Letters arrived daily without fail. The misty Baopu Two-Story Building on the mountain, with its poetry notes pasted on the walls, shone brightly, truly worthy of being passed down. The small preface to the Cornelian Cherry gathering is also recorded, as well as the matching verses of seven-character poems by the sisters Qu Xiangzao and Mei Hui and the scholar Qi Hequan and his son Shaojun Xiaohuan. The Qu sisters also sent a letter to their teacher Qi, which stated: "When Xiang was by the side of the teacher's seat in Hangzhou in the autumn, the teacher jokingly said, 'How about taking you sisters to the literary circle to compete?' Xiang replied, 'Wanting to secure a seat on a famous mountain, a small sail can hardly withstand the wind at Madang. Alas, alas!'"</p>

<h3 id="e89">A Word on the Price of Rice <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>— Daoke</p>
<p>Suggestions for Relief Measures</p>
<p>Food is the paramount concern of the people, and "rice" is the source of sustenance for the masses. The ancients said, "When the granaries are full, people know etiquette; when clothing and food are sufficient, people know honor and shame." In other words, when elephants have "rice" to store, they can observe "etiquette" and "ritual." When everyone is warmly clothed and "well-fed," they can respect "honor" and know "shame." To put it more plainly, if there is no rice at home, one may resort to desperate measures. Without clothing and food, one will be ignorant of the distinction between honor and shame and will disregard everything, forced into committing crimes. When everyone suffers from not having "food" and the fire of hunger erupts, how can they observe order? How can we even talk about security?</p>
<p>Fellow countrymen of the impoverished masses, encountering calamity, have already suffered the pain of being displaced by gunfire and are now facing the suffering of rice hoarding. The price of rice is rising without limit. Foreign rice is sold for 67 yuan and 5 jiao per shi, while domestic rice is priced at 74 yuan and 5 jiao per shi. Under the rice merchants' profiteering during the crisis, the mouths of the poor are being choked again! I ask you, what way out is there for the poor? What life is left for them? I cannot help but lament, "Its demise is imminent, hanging by a mulberry sprout!" Looking ahead, will the tragedy of exchanging children to eat their flesh and humans eating humans (the poor fighting the rich) truly be staged?</p>
<p>I ponder this, I seriously ponder this, the seriousness of the situation is unprecedented! Originally, the current world is a world where one person eats another, the strong bully the weak, the many tyrannize the few, the large devour the small, and the small devour the large (referring to small countries invading large countries). Where is civilization? Where is order? What we see is a bloody world and a tragic ending! It will not stop until the entire human race is destroyed! Recalling that since this isolated island became separated from the National Army and left the embrace of the motherland, the price of rice has risen from 14 yuan per shi to 20 yuan, then to 30 yuan, then to 40 yuan, and so on... up to today's 70-80 yuan per shi. Who is responsible for this?</p>
<p>I pace around the room, my heart filled with worry and anger. I almost want to skin the profiteering merchants and eat their flesh! Alas! The "expensive" in "rice is expensive" is actually snobbish, composed of "insect" and "shell," symbolizing that the rice weevil only knows the wealth of "shells," ruthlessly exploiting and disregarding the plight of the poor. Did Cangjie, the ancient inventor of writing, foresee this and create this "character" as a warning? Saving people from hunger is like putting out a fire. I hope that Shanghai's group leaders, philanthropists, and the authorities of the concessions, who are responsible for security, will quickly implement controlled rice distribution and ration grain according to the number of people (first conduct a quick census). Based on the cost of rice in storage, they should quickly organize sales at fair prices to relieve the urgent needs of the starving people! In the Spring and Autumn period, Xinshi Jiran served the King of Yue and advised him to observe popular tastes, value circulation, promote equality, and prohibit stagnation. The king adopted his strategy and achieved great governance. Therefore, I hope that the authorities of the concessions will emulate Jiran's actions, find ways to dredge the transportation of foreign and domestic rice, and properly plan measures to use the wealth to help the poor (the wealthy families have too much rice stored). They should prohibit (censure) merchants from hoarding rice and profiting from scarcity. They must achieve the goals of observing popular tastes, valuing circulation, promoting equality, and prohibiting stagnation, so that the poor can be saved. This will not only be the fortune of the people but also the fortune of the future of security.</p>
<h3 id="e90">From Socks to Wooden Clogs <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>— Yiming</p>
<p>Since everything has increased in price, clothing, food, housing, and transportation have all become difficult. Just talking about clothing, adding new clothes is harder than climbing to the blue sky. A set of long gowns costs no less than 20-30 gold, this difficulty goes without saying. Even buying a pair of socks requires careful calculation. My socks, costing more than one yuan a pair, are not necessarily good. They wear out quickly, becoming useless.</p>
<p>As the weather gets hotter, socks in clothing can be omitted, and it is acceptable to go barefoot. You don't have to worry about being criticized as "lumpenproletariat" or being labeled as modern. In short, I save mine. But socks can be omitted, shoes must be worn, so at least buy a pair of cloth shoes, which will cost five yuan or more. Leather shoes are even more expensive, one pair can be the equivalent of a peasant family's expenses for half a year in the past. It's not just "the rich man's feast, the poor man's half-year's food," but "an ordinary pair of shoes, the poor man's half-year's food," but now even food is expensive.</p>
<p>I have always advocated not taking cars, so no matter how much trams and buses increase in price, it has nothing to do with me, only my legs suffer. However, thinking that people should work, and also can take advantage of an exercise opportunity, I am very content. But unfortunately, shoes, after this excessive exercise, after not long service, in due course, rudely showed holes and announced the end of service, informing you need to find a successor to hand over the procedures. Unable to do otherwise, running shoes and sneakers are the only grace, but moisture is a defect.</p>
<p>Now the weather is hot, timely slippers are a must, because I want to be more economical, I found the old slippers last year's leather, and wanted to match with a sole, but it costs two yuan and a half, so I had to delay.</p>
<p>On Sunday, I suddenly found in the corner of the box a pair of wooden slippers that were previously handmade, which I always despised. At this time, I remembered its current usefulness, like discovering a treasure, and put it on. Indeed, it's great, comfortable and convenient, whether bathing or after bathing, or enjoying the cool, whenever I get home, I change into them and alternate them with my shoes. In this way, indirectly saving money, directly saving material, isn't it doubly beautiful? If you agree, readers, why not make a pair for yourself in these difficult times?</p>
<h3 id="e91">The Light in the Bedroom <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>— Fan Xuehui</p>
<p>In recent times, as various sciences have gradually developed, many people have been researching and correcting the light configuration in bedrooms.</p>
<p>Modern architecture believes that the windows of a bedroom should be one-quarter the size of the bedroom's area to be suitable for sanitary facilities.</p>
<p>The light in the bedroom should not be too strong or too dim. If the light is too strong, it will easily tire the eyes. If the light is too weak, it will further damage the eyes when trying to see things. Both of these can hinder a person's health. Therefore, generally speaking, the light in the bedroom must have an appropriate balance.</p>
<p>The light should not be dazzling, but gentle. Nowadays, the walls of new-style bedrooms should be painted with non-glossy paint, which is most suitable.</p>
<p>Even the furniture in new-style homes should be painted with non-glossy light gray paint. Non-glossy light gray furniture has the effect of absorbing light and will not, like furniture of other colors, strongly reflect light, causing people to feel uneasy.</p>
<h3 id="e92">A Walking Guide to Shanghai <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>— Cikai</p>
<p>The scope of walking is the road, the tool is the vehicle, the purpose is the house, and the identifier of the house is the direction and street number.</p>
<p>Except for a few inversions and indentations (such as the area around Avenue Joffre and Rue Ratard), the increase in street numbers has a definite direction. Horizontal roads run from east to west, and for straight roads, the French Concession runs from north to south, while the International Settlement runs from south to north. If people walk in the direction of increasing numbers, the left side of the road (or river) has odd numbers, and the right side has even numbers. The segment intersected by the road perpendicular to it often has its own starting and ending numbers. Each segment has an average of 40 to 50 numbers, up to more than 100, but there are often missing numbers.</p>
<p>Based on the above principle, I can determine a good way to find direction. Below are eight sentences:</p>
<p>French Concession: International Settlement:</p>
<p>Follow left add, south. Follow left add, west.</p>
<p>Follow right add, west. Follow right add, north.</p>
<p>Opposite left add, east. Opposite left add, south.</p>
<p>Opposite right add, north. Opposite right add, east.</p>
<p>If we do not know which direction we are facing when walking, first see if we are following the direction of increasing numbers? If so, it is called "following," if not, it is called "opposite." Second, see which side the numbers of the intersecting road are increasing from, to determine whether it is "left add" or "right add." Then, recite the sentence to know which direction you are walking.</p>
<p>The direction of roads in the eastern part of the International Settlement can be seen from the road name, with provincial names for straight roads and city names for horizontal roads.</p>
<p>As for distinguishing which concession you are in, you can look at the utility poles on the side of the road. The utility poles in the International Settlement are square-edged wooden poles painted red, while those in the French Concession are triangular white cement poles. Although the French Concession also has square-edged wooden poles painted red, the International Settlement does not have cement poles. To know if you have left the concession, you can look at the street sign, the street sign of the concession is blue with white letters to distinguish.</p>
<p>If the station does not have a platform or a large sign, you can find a utility pole. There is a section of red paint on the utility pole at the formal station, and a section of green paint at the stop station, both of which can be seen from a distance.</p>
<p>In the French Concession, the fares for first-class and third-class buses are the same. This is not the case in the International Settlement. The fare difference between first-class and third-class is listed in the comparison table below for easy identification.</p>
<p>French Concession: Bright colors, thinner paper.</p>
<p>Western number station table price number</p>
<p>First class lowercase start</p>
<p>Red print</p>
<p>Green print</p>
<p>Third class uppercase start</p>
<p>Black print</p>
<p>Red print</p>
<p>International Settlement: Dull colors, thicker paper.</p>
<p>Station table First class Arabic numeral print</p>
<p>Third class Chinese print</p>
<p>Price number First class red print Third class green print</p>
<p>People in Shanghai often use back doors to enter and exit. Since the back door has no street number, the number often written in chalk is often used to find the street number.</p>
<p>I have not been in Shanghai for a long time. In my spare time, I take a walk on the road, always observing the objects on the roadside and the various ways of walking. Since I don't know much and have no one familiar to ask, nor any books to consult, I have written this article to be used as a reference for newcomers. There are many errors and omissions, and I hope "old Shanghai" people will correct them.</p>
<p>Statement: The article "Talking about Rice" signed by Lv last week, was reported by reader Gu Deyi, who attached a paragraph of the original text as proof and claimed that it was plagiarized from another newspaper. In addition to announcing the cancellation of the manuscript fee, I would like to thank Gu Jun.</p>

<h3 id="e93">(33) Almond Tofu, Sweet or Salty (Four Summer Dishes) <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Preparation... One bowl of sweet almonds, five bitter almonds, half a cup of bean flour, half a cup of glutinous rice flour, half a cup of lotus root flour, crystalline monosodium glutamate, white sugar, rose syrup, or mushrooms, fragrant mushrooms, soy sauce, sesame oil</p>
<p>Preparation... Soak the sweet almonds and bitter almonds in water until plump, remove their skins, and grind them into a slurry with water. Pour the slurry into a cloth bag and squeeze out the juice. Then, steam the juice in a pot, mix it with bean flour, glutinous rice flour, lotus root flour, and an appropriate amount of crystalline monosodium glutamate, etc. Stir with a spatula until it boils, then remove from the heat and let it cool, which will cause it to solidify into almond tofu. Then, cut it into squares. If you prefer sweet food, add an appropriate amount of white sugar and rose syrup. If you prefer salty food, cut it into squares and boil them in mushroom and fragrant mushroom soup first, then add mushrooms, fragrant mushrooms, and an appropriate amount of soy sauce, etc. Cover and simmer until cooked through. Then, serve and sprinkle with a little sesame oil. Its taste is fresh and tender and has the effect of relieving the heart and reducing the lungs.</p>
<p>Note: The taste is weak if this product is made purely from sweet almonds, not as long as the taste of bitter almonds, but too much bitter almond is also toxic, so it is appropriate to use less. Please send to No. 586 Haining Road, this recipe editor, once recorded, will pay a small fee.</p>
<p>If you would like to purchase "monosodium glutamate" and oil, salt, soy sauce, and vinegar, please call "44194" and a special delivery will be arranged immediately without taking delivery fees.</p>

<p>— Ms. Huaying</p>
<p>Among all the auxiliary ingredients in dishes, the cheapest and most suitable one is snow cabbage. Snow cabbage is also known as snow-in-the-red, produced around Taihu Lake. In winter, it is salted in jars and tightly covered. It can be taken out and eaten in the second year of spring. It has a very fresh taste, so it is good to put it in any meat or vegetable dish. In this year, nothing is cheap, fish, meat, shrimp, are all surprisingly expensive, not to mention chicken and duck. For example, in a family with many people, buying four or five corners of pork is not enough for a chopstick pick, so the housewife has to think of an economical way to cut the meat into shreds and put five cents or one corner of snow cabbage in it, (it is even better if you have it yourself, you can use it at any time.) It can be used for two bowls day and night, and everyone eats more. In addition, there are too many things that can "cooperate" with snow cabbage. Don't underestimate it, snow cabbage shrimp kernels and snow cabbage small yellow croaker can sometimes be served on the dinner table. Even in vegetarian dishes, such as snow cabbage braised tofu, snow cabbage stir-fried tea bean sprouts or soybean sprouts, it also feels very fresh. In short, snow cabbage is really like licorice in medicinal materials. It is often needed.</p>

<h3 id="e95">Record of the Examination for Trainees and Learners at the China Book Company <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>— San Hou</p>
<p>At the beginning of this month, there was an advertisement in various newspapers that was as attractive as a magnet. It was a notice from the Shanghai Office of the China Book Company announcing the recruitment of trainees and learners. What a joyful piece of news this was!</p>
<p>The qualifications for this application were specified as follows: (1) Graduates of junior high school with diplomas. (2) Current junior high school students graduating this summer. (3) High school dropouts who have worked in other commercial institutions; and must be proficient in writing and calculation, with some understanding of bookkeeping. The procedure was simple. You just needed to write a letter of recommendation and send it to the Shanghai Office of the China Book Company on Hartung Road, along with a half-length photograph.</p>
<p>The China Book Company has always recruited staff and trainees privately. Like last year, it was not even advertised in the newspapers, and only internal staff knew about it, so there were not many applicants. This time, with the public examination, the number of applicants was nearly 1,300. This shows how many young people are unemployed and how eager they are to find work!</p>
<p>After a strict selection process, approximately 240 people were approved to take the exam. The exam period was last Sunday morning, and the location was the Binhai Middle School on Nanyang Road.</p>
<p>Because there were so many people taking the exam, it was held in two sessions. The first session started at 8:00 AM, and the second session started at 10:30 AM. The chief examiner was Mr. Wu Yugan, the director of the company's accounting department, and the proctors were Sun Zongfu, Xu Danian, and more than ten others.</p>
<p>The subjects of the examination were divided into four categories: Chinese, English, General Knowledge, Arithmetic, and Bookkeeping. The Chinese test was very simple: write an essay on the topic "Seeking Education and Seeking Employment."</p>
<p>The English test was divided into two categories: (1) Noun translation from Chinese to English, with a total of six words: letter paper, envelope, fountain pen, discount, invoice, receipt, mostly related to commerce. (2) Translation of words and sentences from English to Chinese, including eleven questions: related to commerce, such as Dra-ft, bill, Here is a bot-tle of high quality, etc.; and related to general knowledge, such as Season ticket, eleva-tor, telephone, etc.</p>
<p>The General Knowledge test consisted of nine questions, covering a wide range of content. For example: (1) How many routes are there to Chongqing now? Please list the important places they pass through. (2) What books and magazines do you like to read? List them and explain their advantages respectively. (3) What are the postage fees for sending ordinary letters, registered letters, express letters, and airmail letters? (Referring to sending to other provinces.) (4) What is the difference between "investment" and "speculation"?</p>
<p>The Arithmetic and Bookkeeping test consisted of two arithmetic questions and four bookkeeping questions. The second arithmetic question was quite complicated. Now I will transcribe it as follows: There are thirteen male workers, eight female workers, and seven child workers who jointly contracted a job that took thirty-four days to complete. The total wages received were nine hundred and eighty-six yuan. It was agreed to distribute the wages according to ability. The ability of a male worker is twice that of a female worker, and three times that of a child worker. Question: What is the daily wage of each person? The four bookkeeping questions were: (1) What are the differences between single-entry bookkeeping and double-entry bookkeeping? (2) What are the differences between cost accounting and general accounting? (3) What are the elements of bookkeeping? (4) What is the accounting term for the net amount of assets exceeding liabilities?</p>
<p>It is said that the quota for this recruitment is 60 people, and those who pass the exam will be assigned to the company's accounting department, editorial department, distribution department, and other departments. During the service period, in addition to regular salary, there are basic subsidies, living allowances, and so on. After the apprenticeship period is over, they can be promoted to formal staff members.</p>
<p>The results will be announced after one month because after the list of those admitted is finalized, it must be submitted to the Hong Kong headquarters for verification, as usual.</p>

<h3 id="e97">Strengthening Unity Among Employees <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Wei</p>
<p>No one can deny that the Chinese nation has united. But no one can admit that this unity is very solid. Let others talk about the big picture; let's look at the situation among employees.</p>
<p>First of all, we should recognize that in the process of China completing its great cause, the efforts of employees play a decisive role; therefore, strengthening unity among employees has become a very important issue.</p>
<p>Only by diagnosing the problem can we prescribe the right medicine. What are the shortcomings of unity among employees?</p>
<p>Undeniably, China, under the control of a semi-feudal and semi-colonial economic structure, has demonstrated complete feudalism in its various industrial and business sectors. Most employed workers have no one to rely on, so there will be "a new emperor brings in a new courtier" situation, and restrictions will be imposed on employee unity... This is an objective reason why employees cannot unite well.</p>
<p>The subjective aspects are: First, staff look down on workers and trainees. Among the same class, those who came first look down on those who came later. Second, Ningbo people feel that Cantonese people are too stiff, Cantonese people think Ningbo people are too stingy, and Jiangbei people are looked down upon by everyone. This is a kind of localism. Third, relying on "connections," individuals climb upward, harming others to benefit themselves. Fourth, the bad habit of sweeping only the snow in front of one's own door. Fifth, the relationship between men and women is mostly "no touching," and so on.</p>
<p>Obviously, these wrong ideas cannot exist. First, the determination of the workers and the ideological progress of the trainees are of great help to the staff. Why should we look down on them?</p>
<p>Second, in today's united nation, why do we still insist on this kind of localism? Third, relying on "connections" and climbing upward is not going to work. We should pay attention to collective power. Fourth, taking care of yourself alone cannot be managed and will slowly send yourself to the grave. Fifth, in the present situation where men and women work side by side, "men and women should not touch each other" should no longer exist.</p>
<p>As for reforming the defects of the industrial sector itself, this cannot be separated from the cause we are currently undertaking.</p>
<p>I hope everyone pays attention to this issue.</p>
<p>He exclaimed in surprise: "Oh, there is so much money here! Li Lan is really confused, how could she just put the money in the drawer like that?"</p>

<p>Hawthorne did not answer, but showed Li Zhiban the photos. Li Zhiban took a look and took out two half-length photos in Western suits.</p>
<p>He pointed to one and said, "This is the one surnamed Yu." Then he pointed to a small two-inch photo, "This is the one who has been coming in and out here often these days, the taller one."</p>
<p>I leaned closer to look; the one surnamed Yu was only about twenty years old, with a very handsome face, and the smaller one was older, with a square jaw and particularly bright eyes.</p>
<p>Hawthorne nodded and put these two photos in his chest pocket, put the rest back in the drawer, and closed the drawer.</p>
<p>Hawthorne said to Li Zhiban, "Mr. Li, you can go back upstairs and rest now. Regarding what happened last night, I want to ask the servants here first. If there is anything I can ask of you, I will come and ask for your advice. I don't think you will mind."</p>
<p>Li Zhiban hurriedly replied, "What are you saying? Li Lan died so tragically. As long as I can help her get justice, I am willing to do whatever I can."</p>
<p>Hawthorne bowed. "Thank you." Then he watched the old man with a hunched back and coughing walk out.</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou stood up and asked, "Should I call old Mao in? He is in the guard room outside."</p>
<p>Hawthorne said, "No, call the maid first."</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou responded and just as he walked out of the door of the reception room, Li Zhiban suddenly retreated back in.</p>
<p>He said, "Mr. Hawthorne, I'm sorry, I was really careless, I forgot my cigarette holder again." He walked to the desk, picked up the imitation ivory cigarette holder from the edge of the desk, bowed again, and walked out.</p>
<p>I said to Hawthorne, "I just guessed that this cigarette holder didn't seem like it was left by the murderer. Because the murderer came in to assassinate, he would definitely not be so calm and unhurried as to hold a cigarette in his mouth."</p>
<p>Hawthorne just nodded, seemingly agreeing with my view. (24)</p>
<h3 id="e99">Summer Vacation Volunteer School <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>— Lian</p>
<p>I recently received news from a classmate that a summer vacation volunteer elementary school for neighborhood children will be opening inside the Youth Association Middle School at 599 Sichuan Road. Most of the teachers are students from the Youth Association Middle School, using their summer vacation to help children who are out of school. The school is divided into four levels of primary school and two levels of higher primary school. The primary school curriculum focuses on Chinese language, general knowledge, and arithmetic; the higher primary school also includes English. Regarding tuition fees, they do not charge any fees. They only take a security deposit of 2 jiao when registering, which will be returned after the end of the semester (limited to those with less than three absences). The school also provides all books and supplies free of charge. After the end of the semester, students with excellent grades can not only receive a bonus, but can also be recommended by the school to appropriate middle and primary schools.</p>
<p>The school is scheduled to officially start classes on June 29th (until August 31st), and registration is from now until June 28th. The location is inside the Youth Association Middle School on Sichuan Road. Any male or female student under the age of sixteen can register.</p>
<p>In the midst of rising book and stationery prices and increasing tuition fees at various schools, the establishment of this school is really good news for out-of-school children.</p>
