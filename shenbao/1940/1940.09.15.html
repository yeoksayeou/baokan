<h3>戰時國際宣傅的運用</h3>
<p>歷史告訴我們；每次戰爭的決勝因素，除了武力物力之外，宣傳的運用也佔着重要的地位；宣傳得法，足以妨礙敵人的行動或加速敵人的潰敗，反之，如果宣傳拙劣，往往反而成事不足，敗事有餘。</p>
<p>一八七〇年普法戰爭的結果，是法蘭四第二帝國的消滅，這是盡人皆知之事；「第一共和」成立伊始，便和戰勝者的普魯士簽了割地賠款的和的。當時，在短短的十個月中，一個羽毛未豐的後起之秀——普魯士，居然能把在一八五六年巴黎會議時代煊赫一時的法蘭西帝國打倒，這當然要歸功於鐵血宰相俾斯麥處心積慮的外交和毛奇將軍指揮若定的韜略，可是雙方所用宣傳手段的優劣，也實在是一個不可忽略的決定因素。</p>
<p>俾斯麥運用得最巧妙，而爲後世史家所最稱道的宣傳、共有兩次。第一次是所謂「埃姆斯急報」，第二次便是關於拿破崙三世企圖吞併比利時的「普法協定草案」。</p>
<p>原來當西班牙王位問題引起法國不滿的時候，法國大使曾安求普王威廉一方阻止利奧波德親王接受西班牙王位，一方保證永遠不使賀亨乍倫王室中人，繼承西班牙王祚；威廉接受了第一項要求，但是對於第二項要求，則認爲法國過於咄咄逼人，不願置答，當時便自埃姆斯城致電俾斯麥，詳述和法國大使交涉的經過。俾斯麥正在柏林爲了威廉國王態度的軟弱而十分懊惱，接了這個急電之後，靈機一動，便把原電語氣加重，而於七月十四日即法國國慶日公開發表了。正如毛奇將軍所說：「本來好像是威廉和法國大使的談話口氣、經過刪改之後，却好像威廉不屑再和法使交涉，而變成對於挑戰者的强硬答覆了」。俾斯麥早就認定一爲謀國內的發展和國外的擴張，非和法國一戰不可」預料此電公佈之後，、法國必定首先走上戰爭之途，而負起戎首的責任：果然，法國政府慣不可遏，於十九日正式對德宣戰了。</p>
<p>這時，法國一方積極備戰，一方却打算拉攏與國，殊不知俾斯麥早已成竹在胸，不待法國在外交上有所成就，即先發制人，把法國在四年前所提出而並未簽字的「此利時協定草案」，交給倫敦泰晤士報發表了；這個草案證明法國也有侵略比國的野心，於是各國—連英國在內，都不願冉予法國任何助力了。</p>
<p>俾斯麥上述第一件宣傳功效，達到了和法國開戰的目標，而坐實了法國啓釁的罪案，第二件功效，却使法國完全孤立，眞不愧爲歷史上最成功的戰時宣傳。再看法國呢，在宣戰之前，陸軍大臣居然公開向拿破崙三世說；「微細如最後一個士兵的最後一隻靴子上的最後一粒扣子都準備好了。」可是，事實上呢，一切都陷於混亂，「士兵找不着長官，大砲沒有子彈，軍官缺乏地圖」，這樣，陸軍大臣的豪語本來想拿來鎭定人心的，現在却反而誤事了，這是宣傳拙劣的一個例證。</p>
<p>就以此次歐戰來講，法國的致敗，多少也吃了宣傳不實的虧，過去對於馬奇諾防綫的功效，顯然鼓吹得太誇張了，同時德國如何不能持久，如何不敢決戰，也嫌說得太抹煞事實了，結果士卒漸至輕敵，百姓過於懈怠，直到德軍猛進、巴黎陷落的前夕，大家還以爲前綫戰事不難轉敗爲勝，誰也沒有夢想到竟就此一蹶不振了。</p>
<p>上述種種，雖是歷史陳跡，却都有其不可磨滅的敎育價值：在交戰國固應懲前毖後，知所致力，同時普天下的旁觀者，亦得檢討今日各國國際宣傳所造就的空氣，得到一些較正確的認識。</p>
<h3>羅斯福下令　擴大飛機禁運限度　包括飛機工程圖樣及設計　其由政府特准者不在此限</h3>
<p>華盛頓　羅斯福總統昨日將飛機油禁運限度加以擴大、使該項禁令包括美國飛機與飛機馬達之零件及製造方法在內、羅斯福總統並下令、凡一切用以製造飛機燃料之機器、必須先取得照會方許出境、此舉當使本國廠家無法將此類設備售於西半球以外各國、此文告係補充五月一日關於飛機馬達出口照會、及七月二十六日關於石油鋁與廢鐵出口照會之不足、（十四日合衆電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　羅斯福總統頒發佈告、禁止以飛機與飛機引擎製造圖樣與設計、售予外人、惟由美政府特准者、不在此限同樣禁令、亦適用於用以製造汽油之設備及此種設備製造之圖樣、（十四日路透電）</p>
<p>東京　據各報載稱、美國政府對日所實施之經濟壓力、日益加重、製造飛機所用汽油之原油、亦將列入禁止出口淸單之內、此種態度顯爲一種「挑釁舉動、」上項消息雖未經官方證實、但日本當局已頗重視、（十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>歐戰叢談（六）　自巴黎到波爾多</h3>
<p>這是法國總崩潰的報告，共兩篇，第一篇是英國曼哲斯德衛報前任駐巴黎訪員所作，原文載六月二十八日該報週刋。第二篇係美國「生活」圖盡週報駐歐分社主任貝恩Ralph　Delahaye　Paine在葡京所發，原文載七月八日「生活」·茲分別迻譯如下：</p>
<p>英報的記錄</p>
<p>六月十一日侵晨，余離巴黎，厥後曾在法國都爾與波爾多兩行都，先後駐足；目覩巴黎居民，扶老拂幼，奔避四鄉，厥狀至慘。余到都爾正遭轟炸。余沿途雖未遭德機掃射，然與多數難民交談，藉悉德機在法境屠殺沿途難民之烈，顯非比境難民之遭遇所可比擬。</p>
<p>余居巴黎凡十四寒暑，對於巴黎及其居民，頗有好感，驚聞德軍旦夕將至，乃不得不倉皇出走。啟程時寸心如焚，情緒萬端，禿筆短文，固不能述其萬一也。余忽促就道，身外長物，連書籟五千册，皆留巴黎，此與其他損失相較，直九牛一毛耳。縱棄呼援無門之故友於巴黎，亦僅大難中瑣事而已。</p>
<p>抑余留巴黎之最後一宵，永誌不忘。是日也，烈日當空，天氣鬱熱，汽車萬千，魚貫出市，終日不絕，午後各要道仍極擁擠。余決在臨別時，赴各街一行，第見義大利蔭路，景况如常，殊可奇也。道旁店鋪，存貨擁積，電影院一所仍開映不輟。信步入熟識之咖啡館，館主巳離出，僅留年老體胖之侍者掌管。該侍者笑靨迎人，謂彼料德軍將於四十八小時內開入巴黎，然不足憂，蓋彼曾於上次大戰時被德軍俘獲，深知如何對付蠢貨也。</p>
<p>垂暮，景况全非。余驅車從歌劇院廣塲出發，經行人絕跡之街道而至聖克勞特，準備會同三車南駛都爾。途見士兵一隊，戎衣襤褸，紀律不振，多酒醉高呼。時夕陽西墜，紅光遍照巴黎，且有罕見之奇特黑烟，迷漫天空。</p>
<p>旣抵聖克勞特山巓友寓，縱目巴黎，一望無遺。行裝收拾已畢，余招友人登陽臺俯瞰，乃不見一物，蓋巴黎已爲烏黑烟幕籠罩矣。此顯係是日穗軍藉以强渡賽納河之烟慕，東　而至巴黎上空。</p>
<p>從巴黎驅車至都爾情况，茲不贅言，僅述其概梗可耳。平時此段路程，三小時可畢，乃余等歷十四小時始抵都爾。最先二十哩路中，軍用車及各種汽車，自由車，盈千纍萬，極難行駛。途經凡爾賽，且費一小時有奇。沿途四顧昏黑，車行顚波不巳，其聲轔轔·燈光如豆，雜以憲兵高呼，鬧成一片。此卽居民爭投他鄉之景象也。車經蘭波萊德，行駛稍易，乃入波司平原。</p>
<p>村民見滿載箱籠之汽車，絡續駛過，皆露大惑不解之狀。數處道路，被防禦戰車之平射砲隊阻塞，林中則有面露倦容之士兵，持槍瞭望，以防降落傘兵。比至夏德，大敎堂屹立，在此法國民衆慘痛之中，獨呈寗靜之美，然所見各人，莫不露惶然失措之色。</p>
<p>旋達都爾，所覩景况，混如一塲惡夢。街頭巷尾，人山人海，直令人不能置信。屋宇，旅館無不人滿爲患。新聞記者，政治家，及面貌熟稔之人，雲集國民路畔咖啡館中。藍色小型電車，鈴聲鐺鐺，駛過洛爾橋·汽車滿載行李，往來不絕。或謂國會不久將在都爾集會，當局已徵用旅館兩所，充參衆兩院會所，情報部則設破落舊順中。</p>
<p>吾人在都爾盤桓兩日。至第三日，政府官吏漸不可見，迄午，人人皆已離去，然吾人仍在都爾續留二十四小時。情報部修理牆壁半途停工，棄之而去。吾人勾留都爾最後一日午後，忽遭空襲，轟炸機十二架低飛而來，投落炸彈，多墜飛機塲附近。翌晨又遇空襲。</p>
<p>赴波爾多行程中，較爲乎靜。難民汽車，泰半皆已駛過，故車行無阻。波爾多景况極陰鬱，稍有惶恐氣象。知法政府正在波爾多某處召開緊急會議，且傳邱吉爾已抵波爾多，但無確切消息，郵電檢查與電報交通，殆巳停頓。無論當地報紙或遷至都爾出版數日後，復移波爾多之報紙，消息皆殊隔漠，卽巴黎之陷落，亦僅含糊宣布，外間因之謠諑四起。</p>
<p>所明瞭者，唯萊諾至少欲在北非洲繼續作戰，主降者漸得勢而已。波爾多英僑頗焦寥，蓋法國苟簽訂休戰書，德軍在一夕間進佔此大西洋岸之波爾多港，則將成何局面歟。英僑前往英領署探問消息者，源源不絕。英當局終乃通知英僑準備撇退。次日，吾人驅車至吉侖特河口格雷武角，此卽一九一七年第一批美國軍隊登岸處也。吾人在紀念碑下進餐畢，心重如鉛，離別法國土地。乘艇轉登港外英船，該船原容旅客祇一百五十人，幸賴船長與船員處理有方，載客不下一千五百人，乃得安然返英。</p>
<p>旣登船，德轟炸機一架又來襲擊。次日，復有轟炸機一架飛至上空被逐去，旋在附近被墜落。吾人所乘一船及另一船甫出法國領海，卽有驅遂艦一艘，駛到護送。在此最後一刻，遙矚法國海岸，在夕陽西沉，金光萬道中，漸離漸淡，以至茫不可辨。</p>
<p>沿途砲火連天</p>
<p>德軍策馬前進</p>

<p>法租界自於本月三日起、宣佈特別戒備後、各封鎖馬路交通受阻、字林西報等會接獲讀者來函、陳述進出不便困難、據法警務處表示、此舉純係確保境內良好秩序以維持治安、故決將繼續採取、現僅嵩山路昆連愛多亞路、卽滬光大戲院東首封鎖鐵絲網架、業經撤除、惟已置有鐵甲車、並派駐中西探捕、檢查行人、戒備仍嚴、</p>

<h3>孤軍與白俄團丁　兩度發生衝突　工人修理球門獨怒孤軍　雙方堅持迄昨猶未解決</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報云、新加坡路孤軍營今（十四日）晨發生互毆情事、先是工部局工務處苦力數人、昨（十三日）往該營修理足球塲門、觸怒孤軍士兵、旋經謝團長允苦力今日前往修理、故未肇事、惟工務處苦力今晨赴營進行修理時、又與孤軍士兵言語不合而互毆、守營白俄商團以事態重大、不能應付、乃有白俄商團兩隊趕到排解、而公共租界警員一隊、亦到塲協助、聞互毆結果、有孤軍士兵數名及工務處苦力若干受傷、白俄商團向天開槍數響、示警之說、則未能證實、工部局某員頃稱、當局已與謝團長進行磋商、以便終止紛擾、但至午後爲止、尚未獲滿意解決、</p>
<p>修理球門　發生衝突</p>
<p>字林報云、昨日（十三日）午前將近十時、新加坡路孤軍營中士兵、與守衛該營之白俄商團、險肇事端、嗣經雙方長官互讓、終告無事、事緣昨日上午九時許、工部局工務處苦力前往該營修理足球塲門、謝團長</p>
<p>加以反對乃有孤軍士兵百餘人、竚立球塲門首、苦力不得不放棄修理工作、管理該營之商團曼恩少校接報、數分鐘後抵營、請謝團長往晤、說明反對原因、然被謝團長拒絕、曼恩見</p>
<p>勸解無效遽令守營白俄商團指揮官、非待謝團長解釋其態度、則不許一人出入該營、孤軍得訊、一致要求准許訪客入營、守營白俄商團指揮官堅以不能背令爲言、致觸孤軍之怒、乃有百餘人衝入</p>
<p>守營商團營房之院落、擬解除白俄商團武裝、然未實行、同時、守營商團指揮官發電話致白俄商團團部、要求加派團丁前往、因局勢益趨嚴重也、當有白俄商團一小隊、立卽派往、</p>
<p>既抵該營</p>
<p>曼恩亦已到塲、與孤軍數領袖談話、久之、始能勸謝團長出晤、雙方五相讓步、嚴重局勢、終告解決、而抵營之商團一小隊、並米離車、數分鐘後、卽返團部、</p>
<p>繼續堅持　多人受傷</p>
<p>膠州路四行孤軍營、昨日上午九時許又與白俄商團發生衝突、迄至昨晚猶未圓滿解決、據平明社記者探悉、該項衝突係起因於商團白俄隊架置鐵絲網、蓋昨晨九時許、白俄隊正在該營某處出入口架置鐵絲網時、孤軍方面兵士頗表不滿雙方均</p>
<p>態度堅決、各不相讓、遂致敬發生揮拳武劇、白俄方面並放射催淚彈及用自來水龍頭向孤軍兵士掃射、一時孤軍營房頓成澤國、該管捕房聞訊後、卽趕往彈墜、同時義大利防軍亦在星加坡路一帶出動佈防、一時情勢頗形緊張孤軍營與外間之交通、均被切斷、並謝團長之對外電話、亦遭阻絕、雙方</p>
<p>衝突結果、孤軍方面曾有八九人受傷、迄至昨日晚間、此一糾紛、仍在僵持中、據悉工部局方面昨爲此事曾與謝團長舉行談判、但迄記者屬稿止、尚未聞有結果、又據另一消息、謂比次糾紛係因修理足球塲門而起、但未能證實、</p>
<h3>米糧評委會　仍應繼續存在　評委會函當局請求指示　抬價掮客由法院嚴懲</h3>

<p>租界當局　應予指示</p>
<p>昨據本市某聞人語新聲社記者云、際斯民食恐慌之時、米糧評價委員會似應繼續存在、惟該會之增厚實力、誠不容刻緩、故望兩租界當局切實指示南針、及加派委員參加與議、並飭令將該會旣定方針、按步實施、及作有力之援助、吾則滬市整個米市、將不堪設想矣、</p>

<p>法院嚴辦　抬價掮客</p>
<p>本市食米、因價格一再飛漲、工部局及米業團體乃聯合訂立限價、然一般米商、徒知中飽己囊、罔顧民衆利益、雖經限價、然咸陽奉陰違、實際市價超越限價甚巨、曾經工部局對違令之輩、依法向法院起訴處辦、始稍殺彼輩氣焰、惟以日久玩生、又有此類事件發生、緣工部局政治部派駐米市塲之監視員華探茅國實、於前日上午十時三十分、發見有米掮客靑浦人孫全觀、以二號西貢米樣一包、謂有米五十包、向人兜售、其售價爲每石六十五元、該探以限便規定此類貢米、最高額爲五十九元一石、今孫之售價竟超過限價六元之巨、遂將其拘捕、乃孫欲以法幣四十元向探行賄、當經探一併帶入老閘捕房、昨晨解送特一法院、由捕房律師方福樞依刑法一百二十二條及違警罰法三十三條起訴、經方推事等予以重辦、以儆效允，</p>

<p>九月十六日（卽廢歷八月十五日）爲中秋節、各業已趕辦結賬、對放出之賬、巳分別派員催收、屬於外埠者、巳請各業公會證明、派員前往收取、今年之各業、因浙閩沿海以及越南之封鎖、以致各路貨運停頓、實銷毫無、貨價低落、整個經濟、異常凋敝、幸經各工廠商號公司竭力設法、今年之中秋結賬節、大致尚可勉强渡過、今日爲星期日例假、明日銀錢業、休假一天、所以各業中秋節之收解、統於昨日星期六辦竣、至於各業市塲、如黃金·證券·外匯·棉花·豆米·雜糧等、中秋節均循例停市</p>

<p>香港十四日（週六）電、今晨滙市開盤英平、美呈動盪英滙現期貨及日滙現貨、均無榮辱、美滙現貨緊一八七五、為二十二元二五、（昨晚收為二十二元四三七五、）申滙現貨降一元、為四百十六元、（昨晚收為四百十七元、）九時三十分、美滙仍告動盪、現貨回鬆〇六二五、為二十二元三一二五、十一時三十分告平、美滙現貨回緊〇六二五、仍為二十二元二五、申滙現貨續降一元、為四百十五元、其餘不動、午收告平、申滙現貨重升一元、仍為四百十六元、下午週六無市、</p>

<h3>中農貳角票之暗記</h3>
<p>中國農民銀行新出之貳角角票式樣，已見前日本報，茲將該票暗記寫明如下：</p>
<p>正面右上角兩株樹頂間有「大」字一，左邊樹旁近「貳角」花邊處，有英文「Ｔ」字，其下兩三分處又有「LE」兩字母。</p>
<p>以上各暗記頗不易發覺，較諸五分輔幣券之暗記尤為細小，自省必有遺漏之處，還待高明指教。　（濟盉）</p>
<h3>金市尚定　節後市場十九日起開放</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤、又告下跌，觀近日金市之動盪、實有極劇烈之投機性存在、一般小本經營者、已咸具戒心、而平時掀風作浪者、今則達其興趣之點、至本日致跌之因、除滙市初況鬆硬外、均出於人心轉變、卽欲上漲、亦被有力空戶所壓住、究因散戶浮多、心手不連、迫而出售者不少、價格最賤曾由開盤六千一百元、降至六千零八十五元、良以收盤前略起買風、得提高達六千一百四十五元、結果較上日軋跌二十五元、午後週六無市、場外走勢復稍疲落、半日交易尚旺、約二千五百兩光景、銀樓飾金終則無變、海關金等仍平、至下週一為秋節休假、週三為（九一八）故週二亦停市、共休假四天、須至週四照常開市、</p>
<p>烚赤跌念五元</p>
<p>自　初開、滙市報鬆、市勢極疲、銀號幫揿價爭先力賣、遂猛揿七十元、首由金號出銀號二十兩、為六千一百元、繼因賣者接踵、某銀號多頭出籠、再挫十餘元、達六千零八十五元低價、後幸錢兌業及散戶等吃胃尚佳、且有隔夜浮空抵補、故價遂漸轉穩、不及回升至六千一百三十五元、但此後某銀號復來狂塞、其數約十兩之上、雖斯時證券幫乘機吸收、然終再被壓小至六千一百零五元、午刻賴港幫活動、立提十餘元、加之未幾滙市轉軟、買戶頓旺、某銀號反出為進、而多戶錢兌業乘勢抬價、故結果竟以當日高價六千一百四十五元收盤、比上日則尚軋跌二十五元、半日六十元上落、場外走勢稪軟、六千一百二十五元、曾有成交、現金號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤較高十數元、收進減低三十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十餘元、均鮮做開、</p>
<p>飾金後又回小</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、九時五十分曾掛小十元、懸六百二十元、但至午刻回高十元、結果仍懸六百三十元原價、新同行與上價相同、收進減低三十元光景、</p>
<h3>英票無人顧問　價再降半元　美票仍盤旋</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市況、烚赤忽又趨軟、英美金鎊因亦各降一元、英金票仍無人顧問、市價再落五角、美金票仍不脫盤勢、終於續跌七分、香港票跌勢頻仍、晚市退至四元二角一分、日金票益感不支、晚市退為一元四角九分、朝鮮票供逾於求、市價疲落、晚市退至一元一角、</p>
<h3>糧食　節邊米價　稍形疲落</h3>
<p>現洋米暗盤自前朝轉趨徘徊後、昨則遂成先平後疲之局、傳說晨間賣戶尚思堅持、未起變化、若二號西貢尚須六十五元二號暹邏及小絞六十二元半、但後卒以時屆秋節、一般投機家及實銷客戶均須從事結束、交易　落、更且銀根關係不特鮮進、猶圖急脫、反為供求不勻、大都求脫、且傳米商以緬暹通運曾有電報二千噸打出、以現市而論似有通劃可能、因此人心與市價一致猛瀉一元以上、結果反比前日較小半元左右、客秈客元續有長江一帶運到、今後尚可源源抵埠、故售價亦見回小五角至七八角云、一號西貢祇六十八元半、火絞六十七元半、六十七元、二號西貢六十四元二角、二號暹邏六十二元、小絞六十三元、六十二元六角、東京砶尖五十八元半、五十八元、海防紅尖五十八元八角、五十七元、米菉五十四元、五十三元半、</p>
<p>糯米雖無到貨、然去路赤澀、市價遂難支持、並落半元至元砠、開金溧特元七十一二元、常丹白元七十元零五角至六十九元、香港特元七十一元半七十一元、普通七十元零五角、至六十九元、</p>
<p>厚薄破粳等國米來源、以挨節均無抵埠、場外暗盤、傳聞以此平定、未有榮辱、黨幫特粳八十元、普通七十八九元、無常蘇崑粳高七十八九元、次至七十六七元、青角薄破七十七元、南港原包早破七十六元半、七十六元、解見七十四元、七十三元半、</p>
<p>新粳尖昨到計有周浦新粳三十二石、太倉嘉定羊尖三十四石、角里杜尖十六石、因其時令妙品、銷場獨佳、所以售價超然卓立、呈堅定之局、計開新粳七十二三元、太倉嘉定、羊尖均為六十六元半、六十六元、杜尖六十七元半、六十七元耳、（　告）今日星期例假、明日秋節米市場各同業從事結賬特休業二天、於十七日照常營業、</p>
<h3>日粉投機　竟出十六元關外　華廠盤有提高說</h3>
<p>昨日二號粉廠盤、仍為十五元半原盤、而現粉頗為軋缺、秋節封關期屆、本街需要甚佳、各廠以生產有限、未能充分供應、　市面暗俏異常、聞廠盤有將於節後提高之傳說、頗引起一般人所注意、良以日廠期粉已漲達十六元外、反比廠盤為高、但事實上均被投機者之狂抬、並非屬於正軌、均為投機者之掀風作浪、蓋鳳凰牌期粉已成為投機籌碼、市因多空雙方之追逐、十月份成交達八萬包之多、九月份亦有一萬包之成交、計九月份開盤由十五元四角半分至十五元五角、比上日大一角七分、十月份開盤為十五元八角步升至十六元零八分、比上日大二角八分、緣漁翁緣砲車客盤仍須十七元、華廠尚不肯售、洋粉十七元四五角、尚須喊緊、但均未聞有正式之成交、</p>
<h3>崇明新麥初到　價開二十五元</h3>
<p>邇日小麥市況、因搬運證頒發困難、內地來貨均稀、華廠收買困難、日廠抑價而取、其相差價格、常在三元以上、故大部分貨主均想扳守待機、不願忍痛而脫、除送廠作價外，迄無正式市面、惟聞昨日忽有崇明新麥初到近千包、頗受內地幫之歡迎、當由內地幫辦去一車、價為二十五元、又被日廠收去五百包、價祇二十一元、市面局勢、隨粉市而帶緊、</p>
<h3>證券　內債不失為堅</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨日祇做上午半天、因今日星期、明日秋節休假兩日、市場人氣比較仍甚穩定、市價漲跌互見、一方浮多因經濟關係、稍有出籠、一方因頭寸充裕乘機吸收、市價乃起落無定、但趨勢情形仍甚堅強、兩日休假變化較多、人心稍有恍惚把握不定耳、昨日上午半日交易、聯益恒孚及零星買進、頗稱踴躍、順昌同康及胡鶴記稍有賣出、各有取捨不同、市價乃高低互見、結果漲多跌少、為數甚微、成交數目約有七百十萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>類別　最高　最低　收盤比前日</p>
<p>股票交易、成交華商電氣股五百股、價為五元九角、</p>
<p>倫敦十三日（週五）電、今日中國外債及遠東英商各公司股票掛牌行市均告平靜、行情概無變動、</p>
<h3>紗花籌碼充足　紗價欲漲又阻</h3>
<p>紗市平凡、上下之範圍、愈形狹隘、高低價僅在十元左右、實因現銷是暢、環境欠佳、加之存貨逐步增加、故多方心思雖濃厚、然籌碼足敷分配、亦無可如何、惟有一部份因外匯仍看有縮面、仍在買進方面着想、不過就本身上而論、上升能力殊為薄弱也、所以十月份在漲時有人套出、價做九百八十八元、</p>
<p>現紗晨開人氣尚稱溫和、良以各方材料並無大變遷、惟人心大都看好、二十支雙馬開價一致喊九百八十五元、做開做開價為九百八十三元、旋聞滙票開市放長、黃金大落、賣風稍熾、跌至九百七十五元、在此價迴旋甚久、卒以市場自星期一起、謂中秋節又值九一八日、共停市三天、十九日再照常營業、一般為避風險起見、均軋直過節、所以市情由軟中帶硬、回上至九百七十九元收盤、查半日間成交統計二千一百五十五包、行情二十支雙馬與上價無甚軒輊、茲將合帮口買去之額量分別如下、</p>
<p>寗波二五　內地二〇　同行一·七九〇　香港二八〇　江西三〇　溫州二〇　統計二·一五五</p>
<h3>棉市且看節後</h3>
<p>現棉情形、仍乏精彩可述、廠胃殊呆、此因紗市不能蒸蒸日上、所以人心平庸、至於新棉、年成雖豐順、然無法搬運出境、亦是徒然也、火機共十包價為一百五十四元云、</p>
<p>另訊外棉市價、紐約棉市、市況堅定、因缺乏賣戶之故、後有一部份之反動買進、結果收盤情況、異常穩定、較之上漲一磅音、印度市況亦殊平靜、連同預測漲半羅比、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、整日靜寂異常、因紗價之未能振作、各方俱暫無交易之思想、擬靜過中秋節後、再作計較也、廠方日來購意亦殊淡薄、</p>
<h3>油市　食油又有壟斷　貨主扳售　價再上騰</h3>
<p>昨日油市又見昂進、出於銷場陸續走動、且一般投機慾燄高張、致壟斷手段痛狂、貨主售意亦堅決、一味緊扳善價、故行情一再上騰、統市做開大連豆油二十桶、價祥市價欄、青島豆油三十桶、膠州豆油五十件、大有餘廠豆油三百五十担、浦東廠豆油三十桶、膠州生油一百二十件、訂九月下交三百五十件、價為六十四元半至六十五元七角半、十月上交一百五十件價為六十五元半至六十六元半、十月下交七百五十件、價為六十六元、烟台生油一百三十件、價為六十五元、青島生油一百三十桶、價為九十一元半至九十二元半、訂十月下交五十桶、價為九十三元、又聽裝一千聽、價為九十二元五角、又據雜糧油餅市場公告、本月十六及十八兩照例休市云、</p>
<h3>糖市　食糖運銷內地　遭受阻礙</h3>
<p>昨糖市因　謂運往內地之搬出證、被某方統制不發、暫難運銷、查申存洋糖雖僅千餘包、但以上述關係、一時不易好轉、公會劃盤遂見回鬆、現貨二四粗白、本棧仍七十八元、外棧新貨七十八元、小六角、轉口貨六十二元八角、不動、荷棉白KD嘜、七十三元七角、小三角、荷赤小一元、　嘜六十二元、雜嘜六十一元、太古車白亦小一元至數角、B嘜七十五元半、DY嘜七十二元九角、HX嘜七十二元七角至五角、國糖亦未開出、</p>
<h3>疋頭　布銷華南獨旺</h3>
<p>國布　昨市黯談、囤戶進出均稀、客銷華南獨旺、惟　批去貨不暢、而蘇浙游擊區裝貨仍受嚴厲限制、滬市存底大增、布廠又有普遍減工之趨勢、昨布價平平、一部份每疋跌一角至二角半、廠方　額賣出尚有暗盤、粵港幫辦色布色斜二百數十件、浙閩幫辦粗布色斜二百餘件、本街同業成交坯布絨布粗布印花布六百餘件、國外暹邏星加坡等地辦漂布三千數百疋、</p>
<p>東布　市氣平疲、交易殊清、十二磅龍頭細布晨開三十二元三角半升至三十二元六角五分、終以實銷呆鈍、仍復回挫、後市收盤為三十二元五角左右、四君子嗶嘰每碼九角一分半、</p>
<p>出口　昨日有疋頭一百七十件、運往暹邏、又一百件、運往烟台、</p>
<h3>夾大衣料　貨多價廉</h3>
<p>夾大衣料馬褲呢·駝斯錦·二種最為風行、目下中秋令節、天氣轉涼、實銷及時、一般專做夾大衣之店鋪、莫不先後旺進配備、致邇來市銷頗為暢達、但觀售價、則各牌子反見廉跌良由前月份中、未旺銷時、空氣緊張、早有買賣、各號但有相當囤積、而廠方因定者踴躍、現貨織出隨亦充斥、兼前怡和廠各貨首先報跌、各貨乃多跟賤、造成目下供過於求、行情下瀉、昨章華馬褲呢俱喊售二十三四元、怡和二十五六元、西貢一〇〇五老牌為三十八元、駝斯錦沽價較馬褲呢抬高一元半、永興貨每碼祇售二十二元、</p>
<h3>金融述評</h3>
<p>— 聖凱瓊</p>
<p>—九月十四日—</p>
<p>節約建國儲蓄的真義</p>
<p>全國節約建國儲蓄運動委員會和全國節約建國儲蓄勤儉委員會發起共同組織的「節約建國儲蓄團，已於六日在重慶舉行成立大會，由中國最高統帥出任名譽團長，孔副院長兼財政部長擔任總團長，為積極推進以求奏效迅速計，由孔總團長於九日通電各省政府主席及市長請一律於九月十五日以前，成立儲蓄團，在九一八至雙十節的一個期間內，積極發動節約建國儲蓄運動，以每一國民每月最低限度儲蓄一元至五元為必達的目標。</p>
<p>中國節約儲蓄的推行，是根據戰時經濟建設三原則中的第一原則「以極端之節約與刻苦，以從事於生産的資本之累積與産業之振興一而來，故二十七年十一月二十九日國府公佈節約建國儲金條例十一條，二十八年九月十二日財部公佈節約建國儲蓄券條例十二條，同年財部於十二月十四日又公佈節約建國儲蓄券條例施行細則八章計二十一條。關於儲蓄券的發行機關，領購辦法，資金運用，均詳載上述三法規之內，本文略就它的起原和對於抗戰經濟的兩點談談。</p>
<p>儲蓄券本來創自英國，第一次歐占發生時變為戰時儲蓄券，是推行小額儲蓄的最好方法，在英國當時成效極著，吸收金額達三四萬萬磅，對於加強戰時經濟及穩定戰後經濟極為有效。這次歐戰發生之後，政府亦立卽發行儲蓄券，在發動十三個星期之內，總數卽達一萬萬鎊之多。所以中國政府在抗戰一年之後，也仿效實行。</p>
<p>至於對抗戰經濟的關鍵，在運用上和目下經濟學家的說素，已大相逕庭。普通都以為政府在戰時財用增加，社會上的資金亦因之增多，故藉儲蓄的方法，吸收社會游資，減少通貨的數量，而以公債方式吸收儲蓄資金而運用之，依這一個方法，如是循環往復，以求增加財用調節通貨。但是果以這種方法行之，以加強抗戰經濟及穩定戰後經濟，其間有一個顯著的現象，便是社會上的資金，全然變成國家的公債，是一種消費財，而不是一種資本之累積的生産財。故目今儲蓄券的資金底運用，絕對避去上述的方式，而以經濟建設底投資為資金運用之繩準，在財富的開發和産業的振興上，求得國營事業收入的增加和賦稅收入的增殖。其求財用增加的目的是同的，以儲蓄方法吸收資金調節通貨亦是同的，但是達到增加財用所採取的技術便完全不同了。</p>
<p>總之，節約建國儲蓄的推行實在是在這抗戰建國時代對於中國財政金融極有貢獻的一種金融設施，在個人方面，可以養成國民令人儉僕風尚，　節浪費，以為個人及家庭生活上改進的整備，在國家方面，可以累積建設資金，化消費財而為生産財，使國民經濟建設得迅速完成，以加強抗戰經濟的力量。筆者檢時中國抗戰以來，深覺對於物力財力的動員，還沒有達到與軍事政治相配合相適應的目標，而戰時經濟建設，這在期待每一個中國國民去共同努力，（未完）</p>

<h3>夫婦知識</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士姚崇培　性病專利醫師詹念會合著</p>
<p>（診所）北京路四川路口中國信託公司二樓</p>
<p>（時間）上午十時至下午六時　星期日休息</p>
<p>婚後男子健康問題的檢討</p>
<p>……人生所求，無病即神仙！</p>
<p>……婚後體衰弱，苦中最悲慘！</p>
<p>因為有着許多的同學，朋友，以及親戚，鄰居，他們在年輕時，我們曾一同遊戲，玩耍，他們的身體都覺得還好，可是一待婚後，曾幾何時，多數已呈衰邁狀態，不特志氣消沉，不復有往年那麽的進取，並且有幾個人竟因多病而致死亡。老友凋零，果使我可悲！因為我是研究醫學的，更引起了我對於婚後男子健康這一問題檢討的動機，</p>
<p>結婚生活究意有否影響於健康？這一問題的解答，可謂「言人人殊」。但歸納起來，不外乎正反兩面。有人說：結婚是有損於健康的，一個男子如果不結婚，永遠地保持着他的童貞，可以享長壽。然而反駁他的人說：事實上只有看見遲婚男子的壽命每比已婚男子來得短。雖然獨身的和尚或許可享長壽，但事實上一個成年男子能夠不結婚嗎？因此，就有一般人說：結婚是有助於健康的，因為男女兩性是天賦的本能，與生俱來及時而表現其作用。這種作用如果過於把他壓抑，在生理上反會發生障碍。遲婚男子最普遍的現象，常有歇斯梯里，神經衰弱等症，據醫學家（Jamsu）詹姆斯脫氏說：「過了二十八歲的男子還不結婚的話，多少總有點神經病。」初時我們不相信，後來細細的觀察事實之後，乃知言之不虛。我們更在生物學上的研究，知道有種動物因得不到配偶，且致死亡。所以結婚實是我們一個人生所不可避免的必要事件。男子只要在婚前清心寡慾，保守着童貞，婚後在夫婦生活上能守衛生之道，則伉儷間的愛情，可以天長地久，永遠的度着他們甜蜜的生活，生育着伶俐的子女，組織着快樂的家庭，如此，不特可以增進他們的健康，更充實了他們人生的幸福。真所謂「多福多壽多男子」。可是一個青年如果犯有自凟遺精，或婚後的荒淫縱慾，則必爆發着滑精漏精，早洩陽萎，精力渙散，神經衰弱等症，這樣，不但多病折壽，促短了他們的天年，就是在夫婦生活上，亦必不能協調，每為妻痛恨，演出家庭間之種種悲慘！弄到這個地步，那問題就更嚴重而複雜了。唯一補救辦法，據世界名醫及余經騐，均以服生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」，最為對症而特效。。因此劑係由雄壯動物體中提取的生殖腺素用科學方法複製而成，所以品質純粹，藥性王道，補力積極，實為其他腺素製劑所不及。服後於一日夜間即能生精補腎，健腦活血，滋養神經，若能繼續服用，持之以恒，則必可於短期內將上述各症完全治癒，惟有遺精者須兼服「希米脫氏固精片」，以固精關，制止遺洩，則收效尤速！</p>
<p>健美</p>
<h3>乳峯在女性健美上的價值</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士姚崇培</p>
<p>不是說一句長他人志氣，滅自己威風的話，西洋女子，的確要比我們中國女性健美得多，不但他們在少女時代，個個胸脯挺直，雙乳高聳，臀部肥大，走在路上，自有一種雄糾糾，氣昂昂的氣概，便是幾位年老婦女，頭發雖然白了，她們胸口的一對乳峯，還是那麽地高聳着，並沒萎　下去，所以她們生下來的子女，也特別的聰明而伶俐，國民的體格也特別的強。</p>
<p>據世界著名美容專家兼生理學家康德林，與婦科專家湯潑生等的研究結果，認為女性的乳峯，能夠愈高而愈有彈性，不僅在美的方面，可以和臀部腰身，構成最神秘的曲線。使每個男子看了，發生一種良好的感覺之外，同時因着自身卵巢機能的健全，新陳代謝作用的旺盛，性情無不曠達柔順，肌肉無不晶瑩潔白，想想更無不　敏而周密，雖遇難題當前，都能夠條分縷析的處理之，不至於感得應付困難，此外，更因血液循環的充暢，在面部便泛起了桃花迎人一般的笑靨，雖然脂粉不施，也是豔麗非常，年齡雖增，而青春長駐，兩性生活，更是無限甜蜜，組織健壯而活潑的子女，這樣的女性，她們對於國，對於家的功績，真是多麽大啊！可是過去如因束胸，自瀆，月經不調，白帶不感諸症，以致乳峯萎　，臀部瘦削，健美喪失者，則不但在處女時，已是多病多病，毫無美感動人的姿態，而且一旦遺嫁而後，亦因性感淡薄及上述種種缺陷，而為丈夫增惡，甚至遺棄不顧呢！唯一補救辦法，即服卵巢製劑女用「生殖素」以培補經血，使卵巢機能臻於健全，新陳代謝作用亦因以旺盛，則上述各症不特可以完全根治，並可使乳峯高聳，面頰紅潤，增進健美。</p>
<h3>遺精與自凟是青年的惡魔</h3>
<p>— 性病專科醫師詹念會</p>
<p>這也許是社會的畸形病態吧！當這節約救國的非常時期，在這孤島上仍然燈紅酒綠，佈滿着色情淫蕩的羅網，一般剛在發育的青年，處在這富有誘感性的環境裏，何況他的心也正在憧憬着兩性間一切的秘密，預備去怎樣試探一個究竟，可是他們一方面因為困於經濟及花柳病的可怖，不敢公然去宿娼，但一方面又掙脫不了桃色的迷惑，於是不得已而求其次，便開始犯上自凟，</p>
<p>一個青年犯有自凟之後，即使他平日的思想是如何豐富，記憶力是如何強大，體力是如何結實，但到了這個時期便不知不覺的退化下來，如果因自凟放縱而連帶患有遺精滑精以及漏精症，此時，不特使你的發育機能停滯下來，成為發育不全，面黃肌瘦，未老先衰，那真所謂是「小老人」！這種「小老人」學問與事業為因腦力與體力之不濟，弄得一事無成，並且因為腎虧無能，精力渙散的原故，還要破壞他日後夫婦生活中的幸福！然而他的妻子，怎能長此蹉跎青春，因此演出家庭間之種種悲劇者，亦是常事！</p>
<p>關於治療遺精的方法，在今日市上雖有多種的宣傳，但最特效者，據世界名醫及余多年試騐，均以服「希米脫氏固精片」為最，因此劑不特可以鞏固精關，且可鎮靜神經，使青年之神經衰弱者，得到安眠，是以夢境減少，心緒煩亂全無，遺精乃得以根治，惟因遺精已引起上述症象者，須兼服生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」，以培補腦腎，增益精血，滋養神經，若能繼續服用，必可於短期內完全恢復健康，</p>

<p>非常時期義務送診僅收號金四角</p>
<p>新老白濁均能短期內治癒之</p>
<p>不信請來一診，事實便是鐵症！</p>
<p>在識見淺薄沒有見過最新科學利器的患者看到我這個標題以後，或許要産生許多懷疑，認為你這位醫師在大言欺人了。但在曾受最新科學洗禮或是曾　就余治療過的病眾看來，他們自然覺得我這個標題，壓根兒　不上誇大。因為現在的世界究竟不是十九世紀，你瞧：不拘吃的用的走的各種東西。那一樣不隨時代而進步。那麽十九世紀人們認為難以治療斷根的白濁，難道便會沒方法將他制代嗎？所謂「事在人為」，其焦點便在你並不能夠專心一志的去研究，那倒是真的。至於我治療新舊白濁的方法和醫具，這裏我可以很坦白的告訴諸位一些：因為醫治白濁，是我十七年來的專職，平時既不薄藉虛名而養尊處優，依然事事躬親，孜孜研求，絕不假手助醫。對於用藥施術，更精密審慎，忠誠不欺。至於治療器械，只要確具實效，那不管它價格如何昂貴，必設法購置之。約略言之，有尿道鏡，膀胱鏡，超倍顯微鏡，長短波透熱電療機，冷却器等，其最為　為我治濁之助者，如德國瀘淋平流電療機，此機殺菌力之佳，允稱世無其匹，故無論新老白濁，一經此機療治，並佐以其他手術與藥劑，真是十拿十穩，担保快者兩星期，慢者五星期，便可徹底治癒，治癒猶不奇，奇能永不復發。</p>

<h3>羅素的敎學自由說</h3>
<p>英國數學哲學家羅素博士，最近曾在美國加州大學担仟講師。今年五月間，紐約最高法院曾以其提創自由戀愛，判決羅素不准在紐約市立大學敎授數里哲學及科學。此案一時在美國敎育界引起軒然大波，其經過情形曾譯載本報。這篇文章乃是羅素敎授的答復，原文載Harper＇s　Magazine，茲譯錄如次：</p>
<p>近白年來，敎書一項職業，已從訓誨少數人精究學術，變爲一項與大多數人有關的公衆服務。自古迄今，這一職業原有其光榮偉大的歷史；但現代敎師，如爲其先進的理想所鼓舞，則將深切感到以其理想敎人，並非其任務所在，而其任務恰在灌輸其僱主所認爲有用的信仰與偏見而已。以往一個敎師必須具備大智大慧，他的一言一動，無不受人尊敬。在古代，敎師並不是一個有組織的職業，也無人對其敎學，妄加統制。他們異端的灌輸學說，因而受到刑罰的，自然也有。蘇格拉底曾被判處死刑，柏拉圖曾被送入監獄，但這樣的意外事件，並沒有妨碍他們學說的流傳。凡於敎師具有純潔悄感的人，無小想把他所著的書，而不想把他的肉體，傳之後世，永垂不朽。理智上獨到的見解實爲完成敎師任務的主要條件，盡其所能，把知識與理性造成輿論，乃共分內事。在古代，敎師除受暴君或亂民偶然無効的十涉外，每可以履行此種任務，而不　干涉。在中世紀時，敎書變爲敎會的特權，結果知識方面或社會方面，都很少進步。迨至文藝復興時代，社會普遍尊崇學問，恢復了敎師範圍，較大的自由。歷來大學等學府，大部分皆操於獨斷論者之手，結果，大部分優秀的文藝作品，都是些與敎育機關無關的學者著成。特別是英國，一直到十九世紀來，除牛頓而外，第一流學者與大學有關係的，爲數很少。但當時的社會制度，對於他們的工作，很少干涉。</p>
<p>在組織較高的現代世界，我們發生了一個新問題。所謂「敎育」，普通是由國家有時是由敎會授予各僩人的。敎師因此在大多數情形之下，變爲公僕，必須爲那些不學無術的人，必須爲那些沒有敎學經騐的人，担仟敎育子弟之責。他們辦敎育的唯一目的是宣傳。在這樣悄形之下，敎師很難履行他們所最適合的責任。</p>
<p>國家敎育是顯然必要的，但顯然也包含若干危險。我們所恐懼的此種弊端，已充分表現於德國及蘇聯。這兩國的靑年，巳變爲頑固不炙，不知本國以外的事。這樣事態，雖極惡劣，但如果能像中世紀的天主敎一樣，具有普遍性和國際性，其爲害之烈，或不若此之甚。但國際文化的全部理論，却爲現代獨裁主義者所反對，他們在德國具有一種信仰，在義大利反是一種，在蘇聯是一種，在日本又是一種。在這些國家中，每一個國家對於敎育靑年，都特別注重，在熱的國家主義，結果，一個國家的人民與別國的人民，沒有共同的立塲，而在互相殘殺方面，也無共同文明意識加以消弭了。</p>
<p>在民治國，此類弊端還無此之甚，但在敎育上，亦有同樣嚴重危險存在，這項危險，只有相信思想自由的人，小心防止敎師們知識上受束縛，才可避免。我相信敎授某種無可置議的知識倒是敎師責任上最不重要的一項。自然，這是別項知識所根據的基礎，對於我們的機械文明具有極大的用處。在現代社會中，應有充分的技術人才，保存我們物質幸福所依賴的機械。但人口中如有大部份人不能讀寫，也極感不便。因此，我很贊成實行普遍强迫敎育。但各國政府深知在敎育的過程中，對於若干觀點不同的敎材，很易灌輸與當局有利或無利的信仰與見解。各文明國的防衛，其責任在敎師手中，正不下於軍隊。除開極權國當作別論外，國家的防衛自屬必要，爲此項目的而施行的敎育，其本身並無批評之處。所可批評者，只有國家用文盲制度及訴諸不合理的熱情來保衛而已。</p>
<p>此項方法，對於任何值得保衛的國家，都不需要。然而那些對於敎育沒有直接認識的人，都對於採用此項方法，具有一種自然傾向。有好多人相信輿論的統一與自由的限制，可使國家趨於强盛。自一七〇〇年以來，每次重要戰爭，勝利雖多屬諸比較民治的國家方面，然却一再聽到有人發表意見，認爲民治足使一個國家在戰爭中柔弱無能。但由過去的事實看來，促成國家危亡的，由於主張狹義的思想統一者，較之主張思想自由者爲多。世界獨斷主義者雖亦知此，然他們却認爲兩個不同的意見，如聽其皆有自由發表的機會，足以使人走入歧途。此項見解適足以引起兩種不幸：非一派獨斷主義者征服世界，禁止一切新思想，卽另一派的獨斷主義者征服其他區域，宣傳仇視的信條，以兵戎相見，類似前者的罪惡，發生於中世紀，類似後者的罪惡，一見之於宗敎戰爭時代，再見之於現代。前者使文明停滯不進，後者使文明有整個摧毀之慮。爲防止此兩者計，敎師應盡文明之主要保衛人的任務。（未完）</p>

<h3>十七世紀倫敦大火</h3>
<p>— L</p>
<p>這幾天，德國空軍轟炸倫敦，連繼不斷。投下的炸彈，量以噸計，除生命的喪失不計外，民房官舍，化爲廢墟，繁盛鬧市，變爲瓦礫塲。所謂「火獄」兩字眞可以概括一切了。從歷史上看來，這種生命財產損失的浩刧，確是空前未有。不過以災殃而論，二百七十四年之前，倫敦亦曾發生過歷史上未有的大火，連續不歇燒了三日三夜，餘燼七天猶未息滅，整個的市區精華，差小多全部都化爲焦土，廣達四百五十公畝，無家可歸者二十萬人，損失總數約七百三十三萬五千鎊。所奇者生命喪失祇有八人。而且禍不單行，在這大火的前一年，倫敦又曾發生大疫，夏秋之交，市區疫癘蔓延，死亡相繼，市民們相率逃至鄉間避疫，途中車馬相接，其景象不亞於今日預防空襲，疏散城中居民。那次大疫，從六月至十二月，備僅的半年中，就死去了六萬八千五百餘人，豈非駭人聽聞。所幸英國人以目强不息的精神，來對付這些異常的災難，從敗垣斷壁，焦木廢墟之中，終於建築了一個簇新的「大倫敦」。下面所記大火情狀，大部份根據常時海軍大臣皮普斯（S．Pepys）和著作家愛弗林（John　Evelyn）兩人的日記。</p>
<p>一六六五年倫敦大疫，自上年冬至木年春，滴雨不見，造成從來未有的乾早。英王查理二世歸英之後，王政復古，巳屆五年，雖然政治設施，一切更張，但倫敦狹隘的街道，和擠居的習尚，還是依舊如故。而且城中飲水供給，很不淸潔，水源又不暢通，這多是釀成大疫蔓延的原因。六月十日疫病初見，不到半月，已到處皆是，居民驚駭之餘，只有出於逃避。一時到鄉間去的路上，男女老幼，挑箱携籠，車馬踵接。旬日之內，熱鬧的市區，變成一個死城。除了幾個熱心的敎士，醫生外，所有官吏，商賈仕人，一槪遠走高飛。街道間除了衛生隊，埋葬隊之外，他無所見。偶然有人在街是走過，也是俯首疾行，一語不發。差不多除了「偉大而可頌的上帝之外」，大家相對，無話可說。大小說家卽魯濱遜飄流記作者狄幅，曾把當時目擊的可怕情形，寫了「疫年見聞錄」一書，傳誦於世。大詩人密爾頓則於是年避疫鄕問，完成他的不朽傑作「失樂園」。疫勢直到年底稍殺，那知一波未平，一波又起，不到一年工夫，倫敦却遭了歷史上最的大火災。</p>
<p>被稱爲「奇異之年的一六六六年，眞可謂流年不利」之至。英國方面對荷用兵，庫帑用如流水，一方面倫敦又遭受空前的火災損失，法王路易十四又於是年聯荷，對英宣戰。大火發生於九月二日禮拜天早上三時，起初是東城報告火警，擾攘了一會，大家以爲沒有事了。「隔岸觀火」的一班好事之徒，看看沒有新發展，也就重入睡鄕。那知一到早晨，情勢大變，火頭四竄，連接近倫敦橋的許多屋子也被波及了。此時天氣旣燥又熱，東風吹來，如在火坑之中。近太晤士河街道的房屋不久均巳着火。人家所養着的許多鴿子，在窗門洋臺旁亂飛着，繞翔數匝，無枝可棲，終於被火燒灼，墮地而死。</p>
<p>在風緊火熾的時候，誰多想不出法子去撲滅它。自從天旱大疫以來，倫敦的建築物都是乾燥異常，一着火便延燒開來。大家望着四處亂竄的火舌，目瞪口呆，一籌莫展。忙得不開交的海軍大臣（卽紀錄大火情形的皮普斯），入宮啟奏皇上，請傳旨把所有着火的屋牆，摧毀拖倒，庶幾火舌不致蔓延。英王准奏，叫他會同倫敦市長，辦理其事。海軍大臣在街上碰到倫敦市長，只見他如痴如醉，口中儘是喊着：「天哪，叫我怎樣辦呢！」但是他顧慮在這惶亂擾攘的當兒，恐怕老百姓不肯服從他的命令。後來除了拆屋之外，其他仍舊無法可施。</p>
<p>皮普斯駕着小舟在太晤士河上觀察火勢。不多一會，英王和的克公，也乘着花艇，溯流而來。他們命令岸上，快把屋壁圍牆推倒，以阻火勢。但是牆倒慢而火舌竄得快，還是無濟於事。太晤士河上而照耀如同白晝，駁船小艇到處皆是，把從火堆裏搶救得到的貨物，運到船上。居民們的傢具日用品，搶救上船的很少。有一隻船中，祇裝了兩個小瑟，他無所有。因爲那時市民很愛好這種樂器，一時慌亂，重要的東西倒反而不拿了。</p>
<p>九月裏的天氣還很熱，傍晚之時，一片紅光，襯托着色如胭脂的夕陽，格外叫人感覺到燥熱可怕。天空中火星火花到處飛舞。從一問着火的屋子中，幾個火球似的東西衝空飛起，過了五六家門面，又落在另一家未着火的屋子上面，於是這人家立刻就被延燒了。有幾倏陋巷中的屋子，多數屋頂是草葺的牆壁是木板的，一經燒着，便不可收拾。而且靠河岸的倉庫中，又棧着許多瀝靑，柏油，和油酒之類，火勢所至，更無倖免。是夜，一股巨大的烟火，像數圍大的一條火蛇，直竄敎堂區而去，著名的聖保羅大敎堂等建築卽遭大火之厄。</p>
<p>愛弗林的日記爲紀錄倫敦大火的珍貴史料，對於當時情狀，描寫頗爲忠實。他在星期日下午，從岸邊觀火；至星期一，又回到原處，看南半城的火勢。當火舌達到敎堂區的時候，他也在那裏觀望。聖保羅大敎堂這時在修葺之中，四週搭了工人做工的木質台架，火舌一到便燒了起來。當時火塲中一片爆炸劈拍之聲，女人小孩驚駭之餘，大聲呼叫；又雜以房屋，尖塔，禮拜堂等的塌倒聲，竟像排山倒海的浪嘯一般。因爲火勢過甚，空氣窒息，燒灼得溫度極高，大家都沒有法子可以走進火塲，只有站在原處，聽其自然燒燃。在兩英里長，半英里廣的一區中，熊熊的大火，竟成一隻碩大無朋的洪爐。烟霧硝氣，上冲半天，一直伸展到五十英里之外</p>
<p>九月四日，星期二，火勢蔓延到弗利脱街，老增萊，華威街等處，聖保羅大敎堂的磚石，四處飛射，好像在丟手溜彈。敎堂建築物中的五金鉛錫，被火燒溶，流在地上好像河流。門前的人行道階石等都燒得通紅，人馬不敢踐踏。屋角廢垣從半空裏倒場下來，焦木瓦礫將路上交通完令遮斷。宮廷之中這時亦頗慌亂，英王查理二世和他的兄弟，以身作則，親自指揮一切。官員等在每條街上督率庶民，做倒牆覆屋的工作。</p>
<p>五日，風勢稍殺，大股的火舌亦沒有像前兩天的猖獗了。法學院之西，史密士之北，火舌不釗，倖保完整。這天是禮拜三，總算燒了三天三夜，火勢漸漸的在衰下來了。皮普斯說：「自從禮拜日以來，眞是奇怪得很，好像日子非常長，因爲接連幾天睡眠的時間很短，又看見了種種不同的景象，好像巳過了一個多禮拜，而且把星期幾的日子也都忘懷了</p>
<p>許多人正在河岸，和太晤士河之南高地看火景的時候，河北曠地巳充滿了許多許多無家可歸的男女老幼，從伊士林頓到「高門」之間，一路上流離失所的的有二十萬人之多。各種不同的階級，諸色人等都有。大家偃臥路旁，嗷嗷待哺，一幅哀鴻之圖，景象十分悽切，可是他們倒也並未伸手求人救濟。英王，貴族，敎會方面都自動拿出錢來，做救濟災民的工作。凡是最窮困的人，咸得到款項的拯濟，不過救濟工作，進行很不容易，尤共爲食物難以獲得，凡是平常的來源，這是咸已阻隔不通。後由官廳佈告，叫四鄕農民儘量把食物向城市裏　來。災民們如欲往鄰城或鄉間去，亦由官家予以各種便利。鄉下人聽得城裏大火，竟也有不憚道遠前來「觀光」的。這次大火中，文籍書册燒毀甚多。有些書本紙張高冲在天空中，竟有遠飄到溫莎的。黑烟上冒，歷久不散，在大火的幾天中，甚至把秋陽遮掩，黯然無光，遠處來人，多在蔭影之中行走。</p>
<p>貴族們對於英王好像很冷淡似的。據皮普斯說，他們也不來城市，帮助英王，或向他表示慰藉。爲紀念大火而立的紀念碑，上面有拉丁文的紀載，說這次大火的結果，共燬敎堂八十九所，城門，會堂，公共塲所，醫院，學校，圖書館，及官家大厦順無數。民房之燬於火者一萬三千二百問，街道四百條。政府方面所受的損失倒也不小。上年一六六五年，旣因大疫，人民逃亡，稅收銳减，這次又因大火，人民財力大弱，許多人傾家蕩產，那裏還有錢來完稅呢。</p>
<p>紀念碑上本來有一行字，說這次大火由於天主敎方面的叛逆和怨恨而起。後來城市復興委會，看見這行字不雅，便把它取消了。火首是誰，當時也沒有弄淸楚，捉去了許多人，審問研訊，並無頭緒，後來忽然來了一個法國人銀匠，自稱縱火者。當局也未及深究，信以爲眞便把他絞死，有許多人都說，這是官廳方面的恥辱。當局事後又鑄了一種紀念章，中間是上帝的眼睛，下面兩棵慧星，一表示疫病，一表示大火。還有人馬和死亡者之像。上面有文字道；「他責罰了」。</p>
<p>倫敦市自大火之後，不久就籌備復興工作。所有建築物概以磚瓦代替木料，街道，水源，等都大加改革。聖保維大敎堂亦由著名藝術家打樣重建，於是倫敦市便大見光輝，漸漸成爲世界上第一大都市了。</p>

<h3>牌坊</h3>
<p>凡忠臣義士孝子孝女烈婦貞女，皆有旌表之典，所以重名節維風化也。其旌表也，事之重大，跡之奇難者，則由官建坊，若平常則自行建坊；然建坊之地，向無一定處所，各視其地之紳民，相度其宜而已，或於城外空隙之處，或於城內街衢之中。查宋明兩代，建坊者最多，常見街道中跨而立者，皆題宋某官，明某婦，而巍然新建者，曾不數覯。其中多有石色黝然，裂而欲墜，其下倚住坊脚之屋，類皆低小，石之裂者，日甚一日，偶有不虞，住某下者均成羅粉矣。昨聞揚州便益門大街，某貞節牌坊倒落，壓斃一人，臂骨皆斷，慘不可言！此事可爲殷鑒。又嘗見紹興府城所立之貞節坊最多，城內旣不可悉數；而至爲妥善者，莫如西廓門外一帶，凡建坊者，悉聚於此，夕陽影亂，鄕人之歸者，皆穿步於牌坊之下。仰視其額，則城中大抵前明故物，西廓門外則本朝始建者。蓋明以前之立坊，好於城中，至本朝而有知其貽禍於後人，故特擇一城外隙地也。</p>

<h3>兒童儲蓄</h3>
<p>— 秋郎</p>
<p>儲蓄是美德，儲蓄是存储不必要的用款，以備需要時，取出來供給正當的用途的。諸位小朋友：你們在這求學時代，雖說不能賺錢，不能有鉅額的錢鈔，去購買節的儲蓄劵，但你們的父母兄長，每天也許有少數的糖菓點心錢給你們，你們的父兄在這艱苦時代，來担任昂貴的學費，和供給你們的衣食外，更給你們零用錢；他們無非想望你們努力求學，和勤儉耐苦等等，做一個良善的好孩子，像兒童儲蓄這件事，也是你們應當舉辦的。你們獰得了零用錢，切勿要隨手去買糖菓或小食來吃，因爲吃這些非但無甚益處，而且老話說：「越吃越饞也不要以爲數目小，而輕視它，須知積少成多。「一日省一個分，三年十元另。所以奉勸你們，快把這另用錢，日積月累的儲蓄起來，一以養成良好的節儉美德，二則儲蓄是以備不時之需要，遇有急需，便可拿出應用，免得臨時籌款的麻煩，三則你們將來長大成人，爲國家社會服務，需錢用的地方正多着，所以這兒童储蓄，是很重要的，還望你們大家卽日實踐的舉辦起來！</p>
<h3>自新的機會</h3>
<p>— 楊春綠</p>
<p>開學了！小朋友們又在事校裏過生活了！</p>
<p>現在是開學伊始，正是小朋友們的一個自新的機會。不論是升級的，或者仍留原級的，甚至降了級的，都應該自己檢點一下：在過去的學期裏，缺過課沒有？什麼原因缺課的？學業的成績怎樣？什麼功課不如人家？身體上有缺陷嗎？生過什麼病？有什麼不好的習慣？做過壞事情沒有？</p>
<p>「有過勿憚改」古人已指示給我們自新之路。身體羸弱的小朋友，應該注意日常衛生，常常練習運動，使身體强健起來。程度相差的小朋友，要專心學習，努力求學，學業自有進境。行爲不好的小朋友，就把壞的習慣改掉，養成優良的品性。還應該不缺課，守紀律，留心時事，熱心服務，……這樣才是一個慷全的好學生。</p>
<p>「旣往不咎，來者可追！」小朋友們！起來吧！快造成一個新的我」！</p>
<h3>英國的兒童精神</h3>
<p>— 張孟昭</p>
<p>英國的兒童精神！可以作中國戰時兒童的模範！報載：路透社二倫敦電訊稱：載疏散英童之英船一艘，在往加拿大之大西洋途中，被德潛艇放魚雷擊中，惟孩童絕無喪生者，該船共載孩童三百二十人，……喪生者，僅船上會計員一人而巳，羣孩離船入救生艇時，引頸高歌！內有七十餘人，多穿陲衣，昨夜巳在英國北部某港登岸，……孩童棄船登援救船時，秩序井然！……，自治領次官莎士比歡迎脫險，謂：彼等之安返，實屬奇蹟！羣童登岸時，精神飽滿！「若無其事者矣……」云云。</p>
<p>英童臨危不亂的鎭定與勇敢精神！眞可以說：「泰山崩於前而不驚，猛虎躡於後而不懼」了。小朋友們當你讀完這一段電訊之後，再推想到自己的處境，和重慶在轟炸中討生活的一羣小天使，是怎樣的在受苦？倘能個個效法英國的那種兒童精神，我想新中國復興的基石，必建築在你們的兒童身上無疑。小朋友們！快鍛鍊你們的小英雄精神吧！</p>
<h3>七個異國孩子的聚餐</h3>
<p>— 翰卿</p>
<p>一個中國孩子，一個美國孩子，一個德國孩子一個法國孩子，一個德國孩子，一個意大利孩子，和一個日本孩子；這七位小朋友有一天，大家集團到一家咖啡館去聚餐。</p>
<p>他們有許多很好的麵包菓子和糖果，此外還有一罐在這家館子裏買的很大的白塔油。</p>
<p>正吃得高興的當兒，忽然空中掉下了一隻奇怪的昆虫，正巧跌進在這一罐很大的白塔油裏。</p>
<p>中國孩子首先看見了，但他不響，還是照舊的坐着談着。</p>
<p>美國孩子接着也看見了，他大聲的叫了起來：「啊！一只多髒的怪物，飛進這罐美好的白塔油裏去了！」</p>
<p>英國孩子對這位美國朋友的大聲怪叫感到了討厭，冷靜地說：「朋友！把他弄了出去就完了，再把附近的一些白塔油也弄掉了！」</p>
<p>法國孩子驚奇地傘起罐予來看這僩怪物，感嘆地說：「啊！怪美麗的小東西呢，他的二個驕小的翅膀給白塔油點住了」。</p>
<p>德國孩子不聲不響地走來，把那昆虫細心地從罐中取出，說：「這是不經見的昆虫，讓我帶回去仔細地觀察一下。」說着，他把那虫看了一遍，包了起來，預備放進袋裏帶回去。</p>
<p>日本孩子突然站起，把德國孩子手中那個紙包搶了過來，他把那昆虫重又丟到這罐白塔油裏，拿到店主人的面前，聲勢洶洶地說：「呸！你們看，這白塔油裏克有這種髒骯東西，快去換一罐新的來！不然，哼！休想拿得到我們的錢！」</p>
<p>意大利孩子看了日本孩子對德國孩子的無理舉動動了氣，摩拳擦掌地預備厮打了；可是，當他看到日本孩子果然又從店主人那裏弄到了一罐新的白塔油時，便又不響了。</p>
<h3>秀蘭鄧波兒自傳（十四）</h3>
<p>— 民</p>
<p>可是媽媽只能給我弄到每星期五十金圓的薪金，却老是得不到一張好的合同。直到道一的夏末，媽媽接到了敎育影片公司一個電話，請伊前去接洽。據說他們要開始拍攝一套短片，叫做靑年玩意，願意派我一個角色。媽媽立時接受了，然而合同却依然沒有。在他們的意思，只要我先演一部試試，要是成績不差的話，那麼可以繼續下去。所有片中的演員，幾乎全是中學校的男女學生，也有幾個成人參加，我所担任的，是片中一個男學生的小妹妹的角色，在這一班演員中，要算我的年紀最小，那時還只有四歲半哩。</p>
<p>可甘，這是一件很好的事情，你應該知道一些。我雖已做過了幾部影片，但是不常到電影院去的。在我踏入電影界之前，爸爸和媽媽幾乎從不進電影院去，爸爸會對我說，他並不喜歡電影。我記得生平第一次所看的電影，就是米老鼠，至今還覺得這是最最好看的。去年在電影學院的宴會席上，遇見了米老鼠的作者狄斯耐先生，我曾把自己最愛米老鼠的話告知了他。狄斯耐先生答道：很好我把它送到你家裏來，你要是眞的愛它，那就把它留下來好了。」第二天米老鼠果然來了：它並不楚銀幕上平面的東西，而是像黑熊般實質的一隻，我並且得到了它的情侶米妮。它們兩口兒至今坐在我的玩具櫥中，多麼甜密的一對啊！</p>
<p>媽媽說我第一次瞧我自己所主演的影片，是在吾家鄰近的一家電影院中，我老是笑着，拍着手。媽媽時時低聲對我說道：你可瞧見你自己麼？呵呵，那個就是你！那個就是你！」一個人眼瞧着本身在銀幕上出現，這是非常有趣的事。可甘，你聽着自己所說的話，更會引起一種很奇怪的感覺。聽那聲音，似乎分外的響亮，我似乎要警告自己道：秀蘭，你輕聲些，照這樣鬧下去，怕要把大家鬧醒了。」</p>
<p>這參觀我的處女作的第一夜，爸爸和我們同在一起。他瞧了之後，非常快樂，到得全部映完時，我瞧他好像要落淚的樣子，分明是感動極了。如今凡是我所主演的新影片，都可以在攝影上的小電院瞧個暢快，旣不必出什麼錢，並且可以隨我的意思，要看時，立刻好看，只須向搖片子的人喊道：「噲，快開吧，我們要瞧了。於是電燈立時熄滅，影片立時開映了。</p>
<h3>談金魚</h3>
<p>— 漁隱</p>
<p>小孩子們喜歡金魚，則在它的顏色美麗。的確，金紅，柑黃，雪白，漆黑……游泳於綠藻白水間，多麼的富有詩情畫意！何况，它除顏色美麗之外形狀也有獨特之處，縐紗似的尾鰭，圓緊的身體，配上那一雙又凸又圓的眼睛，猶如劇台五的小丑，很能討人歡喜的。所以金魚不獨你們小朋友喜歡它，連失去了天眞的大人們喜歡賞玩的也不少。</p>
<p>有人說，用蠶子可以變金魚，那是無稽之談，你們不要去相信。那金魚究竟是怎樣成其爲金魚呢？原來金魚　　魚變種的。據法國的一個動物學者，吐爾尼爾氏說：金魚之所以變成了金魚的形狀，是由於生命開演的初期，因爲水中缺乏養氣，以致胚胎的精力衰弱了的緣故。」這話不會錯，金魚恰是一種病態變種的；我們看了金魚的運動遲緩，便可證明了。那一些形近鯽魚的，比較易養，比較健康活潑，就是病態較輕，受害還淺的關係</p>

<h3>中秋戲話</h3>
<p>— 君美</p>
<p>中秋應時戲舍天香慶節，嫦娥奔月，唐明皇游月宮三數劇而外，劇本實亦寥落可數，而之數劇者，其主角胥重旦脚，塲面亦俱極單純，以視七夕戲之火爆熱烈，不逮遠甚，故近年梨園有以捉放曹武家坡爲中秋應時戲者，蓋以劇中唱詞捉放曹有「八月中秋桂花香」，武家坡亦有「八月十五月光明」之旬，遂因緣附會，藉以點綴令節，實則此二劇中於中秋二語，初非當時悄景，武家坡尤其爲叙述往事而已。至若說者故以此而譏伶人之無識，此亦未免過於認眞者矣！</p>
<p>梅畹華成名，首在靑衣，繼之而其名太昌者，古裝歌舞劇也。嫦娥奔月一劇，自屬梅氏得意之作，當時樊樊山易哭厂諸老，對梅氏此劇，尤推譽備至，民初某歲中秋，畹華演此劇於故都，樊山目詠長歌以寵之，有云：「今夜人佳月亦佳，月中人更美如花！是誰當得嫦娥號？今古蘭芳一麗華一。顚倒之情，溢於言表。自梅氏息影歌壇後，古裝歌舞剧新進人材絕少可取，於是中秋應時戲卽有演嫦娥奔月，亦有以機關佈景爲號召，非復當時淸歌妙舞之槪矣。</p>
<h3>影壇佳話</h3>
<p>— 淸暉</p>
<p>巳故明星范朋克，數年前東游，梅蘭芳曾於北平無量大人胡同綴玉軒中，大宴范氏，席間范雖以勇士自命，尤崇拜我國古代勇士，酒醉耳熱，乃去西裝革履而易以中華勇士武松戲服，其糾糾雄氣與慷慨之風，觀者咸讚賞不已。</p>
<p>昔有以羣花喩女明星之貌者，曰：胡蝶似牧丹，富麗堂皇，瑤池雋品，王瑩似櫻花，嬌艷動人，富有刺激；徐來似海棠，寵邀春雨，聲擬朝霞；阮玲玉似曇花，美人薄命，千古同傷；胡萍似建蘭，淸芬幽靜：高倩蘋似葡萄，多子多孫；貂班華似月季，隨處可見，林楚楚似臘梅，古色古香。</p>
<p>影壇小丑韓蘭根，平日形狀滑稽，故綽號亦特多；其一曰「瘦皮猴」，因其骨瘦似柴，尊容像猴；其二曰「螳螂乾」，因其兩肩高聳；瘦逾螳螂；其三日「骨頭西施」，因其混身是骨，尤作嬌媚之態也。</p>
<p>女明星對於眞實年齡，均諱莫如深，昔日楊耐梅大紅時，某君間伊年齡若十，答曰二十有　！翌年，某片商又問時，答曰念四。逐年减少，可謂趣矣。</p>
<p>影后胡蝶結婚之日，衣大袖對開黑緞上衣，長约三尺，下着紅緞長裙，週身飾有銀色大小胡蝶數白對，頭挿紅花一排兩肩白紗：達四五丈，極十麗之至。</p>
<p>霍桑探案</p>
<h3>舞后的歸宿</h3>
<p>— 程小青</p>
<p>第七章「把他押起來」</p>
<p>霍桑道：「你旣然說小曾瞧見那人的臉，難道從那條深灰色的西裝褲上，你就辨認得出嗎？」</p>
<p>「不是，後來我還瞧見他的面。」「唉，那末這一回闖進來偸窺的事發生在什麼時候？」</p>
<p>「大約在八點鍊敲過。等到九點不到，我們從白梅酒家走出來時，我就瞧見這姓趙的。」</p>
<p>霍桑似乎增加了些注意。「怎麼樣？」</p>
<p>「那時我在等汽車開過來，麗蘭却拉住了我的手臂，好像很驚慌。伊的眼睛不時向左右探望，我自然也跟伊的視綫看着。忽而伊一聲驚呼，直刺我的耳朶。我瞧見伊的視綫集中在馬路對面，果眞就是那個姓趙的傢伙！」</p>
<p>我暗忖這故事如果確實，合着金梅所說趙伯雄昨夜吃夜飯時到王麗蘭家裏去時的那副神氣，的確有些嚴重。</p>
<p>霍桑仍淡淡地問道：以後怎麼樣？這姓趙的曾瞧見你沒有？」</p>
<p>陸健笙搖頭道；「我不知道。我瞧見他，也祇一霎眼功夫，轉瞬之間他便消滅在人叢中間不見了。我們本來是要到上海戲院去瞧「戰地鶯花」的，這時麗蘭忽聲言不去。我明知伊就因着那姓趙的緣故，分明有些驚慌，故而我竭力鼓勵伊，伊才勉强跟我同上汽車。」</p>
<p>霍桑問道：「那時在什麼時候？」</p>
<p>「大約九點鐘光景，因爲電影是在九點一刻開映的。」</p>
<p>「你當然要問伊爲什麼畏懼這姓趙的。伊有什麼解答？」</p>
<p>「有的，可是我不能滿意。伊說伊和這個人本來沒有什麼關係，因着我要伊跟這個人斷絕往來，他就因此恨伊。伊的話果然說得很冠冕，但我怕還有什麼別的隱悄。」</p>
<p>「怎見得？你所說的隱情，有什麼根據？因爲伊假使果眞聽了你的話突然和他斷絕，他因妒生恨，對伊有什麼威脅，那也是可能的啊。」（一〇七）</p>
<h3>「一馬雙馱」之書面商榷　—答鄭耀祖先生</h3>
<p>— 凍雲岫烟</p>
<p>讀昨日本刊鄭耀祖君大著，關於拙著「彈詞二十種」文武香球內「一馬雙馱」的畫面有所指正，盛意可感。</p>
<p>鄭君的高見是「一馬雙馱」的時候，龍官保應該四肢反縛，跟張桂英背　着背綑在一起·所以然者，有兩種原因：第二，爲了龍官保是個文弱書生，恐怕他耐不住馬背顚簸。第二，龍宮保兩手閒着，難免有不規行動。</p>
<p>第一點，不無相當理由；第二點，則「彈詞家」之「噱頭」而已。</p>
<p>按諸事實，一馬雙馱時，張桂英縱然身手矯捷，也斷然不敢把龍已保反縛在自己背上！試想：背上面反縛了一個六尺壯漢，在崇山峻嶺上躍馬橫戈，是否小女子所能勝任？至於「防微杜漸」，恐怕能官保兩手有不規行動，尤覺不近情理！在這千鈞繫於一髮，生命在呼吸之間的時候，安得有此閒情逸致？</p>
<p>同是一部彈詞，也有幾種說法。居玉泉是一種說法，陳蓮卿，祁蓮芳又是一種說法。天下事本無絕對的是非，我們當然也不必一膠柱鼓瑟」。</p>
<p>我們不過是跟鄭君討論而巳，決不是「好辯」。對於鄭君善意的商榷，實在是不勝心感的！</p>

<h3>Fierce Battle Occurs in the Xi River Area</h3>
<p>Fancheng, 12th – A certain unit of the Chinese army encountered over 300 Japanese troops at the Xi River and a fierce battle ensued. One unit of the Chinese army confronted the Japanese head-on, while another circled around to the rear and launched a fierce assault. The Japanese suffered heavy losses at both ends and retreated in disarray. (14th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Franco-Japanese Negotiations in Vietnam Resume; Both Sides Receive Instructions from Vichy and Tokyo; Air Traffic Between Hanoi and Kunming Suddenly Suspended</h3>
<p>Hanoi – The Japanese military delegation and the Vietnamese authorities resumed negotiations last night after receiving instructions from Vichy and Tokyo, respectively. According to a public announcement by the Vietnamese government last night, the Franco-Japanese negotiations have resumed after the resolution of the “Tongtang” (transliteration) incident. The leader of the Japanese delegation, Nishihara, attended the meeting. The “Tongtang” incident mentioned in the announcement refers to the incident on September 6th when Japanese troops in Guangxi invaded the Vietnamese border at Tongtang. Japanese troops crossed the border at Tongtang on that day, but after the French military officers in the area took a firm stand, the Japanese troops retreated. Last Saturday, Nishihara visited the Vietnamese Governor-General Decoux and expressed regret for the Japanese troops' border crossing. As a result, negotiations in Hanoi continued yesterday. It is reported that Vichy has instructed the Vietnamese Governor-General to resume negotiations, and Nishihara has also reportedly received new instructions from Tokyo. The French authorities held a meeting before resuming Franco-Japanese negotiations to decide on the policies to be adopted during the negotiations. (14th United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing – Air traffic between Hanoi and China has been suspended since yesterday due to the serious situation in Vietnam. It is generally believed that the seriousness of the situation in Hanoi is the result of the resumption of Franco-Japanese negotiations. The Eurasia Aviation Corporation's air route between Hanoi and Kunming and the China National Aviation Corporation's air route between Hanoi and Chongqing have been suspended. (14th United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Vichy – The Japanese claim that Franco-Japanese negotiations regarding the Annam issue have not broken down and are still ongoing has not been published by newspapers here. Officials say that due to poor telecommunications between the Far East and Vichy, the government cannot issue any reports, but negotiations in Annam and Tokyo are still in progress. (10th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing – Long Yun, Chairman of Yunnan Province, recently published a statement in the Central Daily News stating that if Japanese troops land in Vietnam, the Chinese army will destroy the entire Yunnan-Vietnam Railway to prevent it from falling into Japanese hands. He also stated that the destruction of the international bridge between Yunnan and Vietnam was carried out under the orders of superior officers and was China's first step. Long Yun also accused France of violating treaties by prohibiting China from transporting military supplies through Vietnam. Not only were military supplies prohibited from being transported, but commercial goods were also banned. Long Yun also said that France's allowing Japanese troops to pass through Vietnam has caused extreme resentment among the Chinese people and will never be forgotten. (14th Associated Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Hanoi – It is reported that the Vietnamese government is planning to lodge a protest with China, claiming that General Chiang Kai-shek's troops damaged French property by destroying the international bridge at Lao Cai. The Vietnamese government also knows that the bridge was destroyed by regular troops from Chongqing, not troops from Yunnan Chairman Long Yun. It is also reported that the protest will accuse the Chinese army of destroying the bridge, and Vietnam will suspend food supplies to Yunnan and the entire South China region. According to unconfirmed reports, the Chinese army has dismantled the tracks of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway and moved them to Burma for laying on the Burma Road. (14th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Attacking Chabu Repelled; Donghua Army in Mianyang Victorious; Japanese Troops Defeated After Dozens of Hours of Hand-to-Hand Combat</h3>
<p>Changde – According to a telegram from a certain location north of the Yangtze River, the battles in the Han River and Mian River border area are still fierce. After the Japanese troops who attacked Chabu were defeated and fled, they received reinforcements at night and launched a counterattack on the town. Seeing the fierce advance of the Japanese troops, the Chinese army hid in the surrounding area. The Japanese troops ventured in, and the Chinese army, seeing that the Japanese had fallen into a trap, launched a surprise attack from all sides, taking advantage of the bright new moon, and fiercely attacked the town. An intense battle for control began. The Chinese army charged in from multiple directions and engaged the Japanese in hand-to-hand combat, fighting back and forth for dozens of hours, until the 12th. Most of the Japanese troops were annihilated, and the few remaining survivors dared to retreat eastward. The Chinese army pursued the retreating enemy, and is currently mopping up the Jiangjiaji area (northeast of Lower Chabu) on the border of Hanyang. Another unit of the Chinese army, in support of Lower Chabu, simultaneously attacked the Japanese troops at Xiliuhe (southeast of Lower Chabu), driving out the entrenched Japanese troops and occupying the area. The Japanese troops then launched a counterattack with reinforcements, and fierce battles are still ongoing in the surrounding area. (14th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops on the Yongqin Road Invade Nali</h3>
<p>Guilin – Several hundred Japanese troops on the Yongqin Road invaded Nali from Nahe (east of Datang) on the 12th. After a fierce attack by the Chinese guerrillas, the Japanese retreated along their original route. (14th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Chinese Troops Recapture Mengli Village Southwest of Xiyang in Eastern Shanxi; Japanese Troops Northeast of Yushe Heavily Besieged; Most of the Traffic on the Tongpu Railway is Blocked</h3>
<p>Xingji – At the beginning of this month, Japanese troops southeast of Yuci advanced in multiple directions to the southeast. After fierce resistance from various units of the Chinese army, all Japanese troops were repelled by the Chinese army by the 6th. The battle situation is as follows: (1) The 1,000 Japanese troops who attacked Longquan Town (southwest of Pingding) and Zhanshang Town (west of Xiyang) were repelled by the Chinese army on the 3rd and fled towards Xiyang and Pingding. The Chinese army followed and pursued them. On the 4th, a unit of Japanese troops attacked Mengli Village southwest of Xiyang. The Chinese army fought bravely and charged, capturing the village in one fell swoop and recapturing the area. (2) The Japanese troops who attacked Ma Tan Town and Jingxia Village (northwest of Heshun) were fiercely attacked by the Chinese army on the 3rd and 4th. Unable to withstand the attacks, the Japanese troops retreated southward. On the 6th, they were intercepted again near Xijuan Zhangda Village (southwest of Heshun). The Japanese troops suffered heavy losses and retreated, leaving behind over 100 corpses. (3) The 1,000+ Japanese troops who attacked Shiyuan were fiercely attacked by the Chinese army on the 4th and 5th. The Japanese troops suffered heavy casualties. On the 6th, a unit of Japanese troops attacked near Yimaao, north of Yushe, and were heavily besieged and annihilated by the Chinese army. Also, on the 6th, a unit of Japanese troops attacked Kongjiazhuang (northeast of Yushe) and fell into a heavy siege by the Chinese army. The Japanese troops who attacked the Runjiao Town and Qingcheng Village area, seeing that all other units had been defeated, also fled towards Yuci and Taigu. The Chinese army is currently following and pursuing them. (14th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Use of Wartime International Propaganda</h3>
<p>History tells us that in every war, in addition to military force and material resources, the use of propaganda also occupies an important position. Effective propaganda can hinder the enemy's actions or accelerate their defeat. Conversely, if propaganda is poorly executed, it often does more harm than good.</p>
<p>The result of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870 was the destruction of the Second French Empire, which is well known. At the beginning of its establishment, the "First Republic" signed a treaty of cession and indemnity with the victorious Prussia. At that time, in a short period of ten months, Prussia, a rising star, was able to defeat the once prominent French Empire of the 1856 Paris Conference era. This was of course due to the premeditated diplomacy of the Iron Chancellor Bismarck and the commanding strategies of General Moltke, but the strengths and weaknesses of the propaganda methods used by both sides were also a decisive factor that cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>Bismarck's most skillful and lauded propaganda by later historians was two events: the so-called "Ems Dispatch" and the "Franco-Prussian Draft Agreement" regarding Napoleon III's attempt to annex Belgium.</p>
<p>Originally, when the Spanish throne issue aroused French dissatisfaction, the French ambassador had sought William, King of Prussia, to prevent Prince Leopold from accepting the Spanish throne and to guarantee that no member of the Hohenzollern royal family would ever inherit the Spanish throne. William accepted the first request but considered the second request to be too overbearing and was unwilling to answer. At that time, he telegraphed Bismarck from the city of Ems, detailing the negotiations with the French ambassador. Bismarck was in Berlin, extremely frustrated with the weakness of King William's attitude. After receiving the telegram, he had a flash of inspiration and intensified the tone of the original telegram, publicly releasing it on July 14, the French National Day. As General Moltke said, "Originally, it seemed like a conversation between William and the French ambassador, but after being edited, it seemed like William disdained to negotiate with the French ambassador and became a strong response to the challenger." Bismarck had long determined that in order to seek domestic development and foreign expansion, a war with France was inevitable and predicted that after the publication of this telegram, France would definitely take the path of war first and bear the responsibility of starting the war. As expected, the French government was irrepressible and officially declared war on Germany on the 19th.</p>
<p>At this time, while France was actively preparing for war, it was also planning to win over allies. However, Bismarck had already anticipated this and, before France could achieve any diplomatic success, took the initiative and handed over the "Belgian Agreement Draft," which France had proposed but had not signed four years prior, to The Times of London for publication. This draft proved that France also had the ambition to invade Belgium. As a result, no country, including Britain, was willing to give France any assistance.</p>
<p>Bismarck's first piece of propaganda achieved the goal of starting a war with France and established the fact that France was guilty of starting the conflict. The second piece of propaganda completely isolated France. He truly deserves to be called the most successful wartime propagandist in history. Looking at France, before the declaration of war, the Minister of War actually publicly said to Napoleon III: "Every detail, such as the last button on the last boot of the last soldier, is prepared." However, in reality, everything was in chaos: "Soldiers could not find their officers, artillery had no bullets, and officers lacked maps." In this way, the bold words of the Minister of War, which were originally intended to calm people's hearts, instead backfired. This is an example of poor propaganda.</p>
<p>Taking this European war as an example, France's defeat was also due in part to the false propaganda. In the past, the effectiveness of the Maginot Line was obviously exaggerated too much. At the same time, the fact that Germany could not last long and dared not fight a decisive battle was also understated too much. As a result, the soldiers gradually became contemptuous of the enemy, and the people became too lazy. Until the eve of the German advance and the fall of Paris, everyone still thought that the front-line battles could easily turn defeat into victory. No one dreamed that they would fall into such a state of irreversible decline.</p>
<p>The above are historical relics, but they all have their indelible educational value. The belligerent countries should learn from the past and know what to strive for. At the same time, all observers in the world should review the atmosphere created by the international propaganda of various countries today and gain a more accurate understanding.</p>
<h3>Roosevelt Orders Expansion of Aircraft Embargo to Include Aircraft Engineering Drawings and Designs; Government-Approved Exemptions Apply</h3>
<p>Washington – President Roosevelt yesterday expanded the scope of the aircraft oil embargo to include parts and manufacturing methods for American aircraft and aircraft engines. President Roosevelt also ordered that all machinery used to manufacture aircraft fuel must obtain a permit before being allowed to leave the country. This move will prevent domestic manufacturers from selling such equipment to countries outside the Western Hemisphere. This proclamation supplements the May 1st export permit regarding aircraft engines and the July 26th export permit regarding oil, aluminum, and scrap iron. (14th United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Washington – President Roosevelt issued a proclamation prohibiting the sale of aircraft and aircraft engine manufacturing drawings and designs to foreigners, except those specifically approved by the US government. The same ban also applies to equipment used to manufacture gasoline and drawings for the manufacture of such equipment. (14th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo – According to various newspapers, the economic pressure exerted by the US government on Japan is increasing. Crude oil used to manufacture gasoline for aircraft will also be included in the list of prohibited exports. This attitude is clearly a "provocative act." Although the above news has not been officially confirmed, the Japanese authorities have paid considerable attention to it. (14th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Aircraft Accidentally Drops Bombs on US Ship; Chinese Crew Members Slightly Injured</h3>
<p>Tokyo – The Naval Department issued a public statement at 7:30 PM tonight stating that at approximately 1:30 PM today, near Oshima Island in the entrance to Tokyo Bay, a Japanese naval aircraft engaged in bombing exercises mistakenly identified the Asia Queen (16,909 tons) of the Changxing Company as the target and dropped a small model bomb, causing minor injuries to four Chinese crew members on the ship and slight damage to the hull. The Japanese Navy has dispatched a representative and a medical officer to the ship, which is currently docked in Yokohama, to investigate the situation. The ship arrived in Yokohama at 5:00 PM today, carrying 193 passengers. (14th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Outline of the Japanese New Political System Movement Announced</h3>
<p>Tokyo – The Preparatory Committee met yesterday and passed the three main points of the New Political System Movement, along with three auxiliary points. The main points are: (1) The New Order in Greater East Asia will be built in the spirit of building the Japanese Empire. (2) The national defense mechanism will be completed by clarifying the elements of the national structure, reforming administration, and fully utilizing national resources. (3) Every citizen will be enabled to devote himself sincerely to his profession in order to fulfill his responsibilities in public affairs and to harmoniously fulfill his obligations as a subject of the Emperor, so as to assist the Emperor in handling state affairs. The auxiliary rules stipulate that the whole country participate in this movement, etc. The official name of this movement has not yet been selected. It is reported that Army Minister General Tojo has agreed to represent the army in participating in this movement. However, with the exception of the Army Minister, the Vice Minister of the Army, and the Director of the Military Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of the Army, who may participate in politics due to their positions, they will be granted special permission to participate in the "nerve center" of this movement in the capacity of advisors or consultants. Other army personnel on active duty may not join this nerve center. The Army Minister also stated that the Navy has the same opinion. The New Political System Movement is scheduled to be announced on the 17th of this month, at which time the organization and staff list of the "nerve center" of the movement will also be announced. The Preparatory Committee will be dissolved after meeting on the 17th of this month. (14th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Aircraft Attack Sichuan Yesterday Afternoon; Bombing South Bank of Yangtze River; Most Bombs Fall in Mountainous Areas; Six Japanese Aircraft Shot Down Day Before Yesterday</h3>
<p>Chongqing – This afternoon, Japanese aircraft again bombed the south bank of the Yangtze River. Most of the bombs fell in the mountains far from the river. Japanese aircraft did not appear over Chongqing, only flying over the suburbs. The sound of the explosions could only be faintly heard here. According to official sources, in yesterday's air battle over Bishan, six Japanese bombers were shot down near Bishan and Tongliang. It is reported that several more were severely damaged. One Chinese aircraft did not return to base. The pilot was killed and three were injured. The injured all landed their aircraft safely. (14th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing – It was learned today that during the Japanese air raid on Chongqing on Thursday, copies of the Shanghai Xin Shenbao of August 11 were dropped. This newspaper contained a Reuters Chongqing dispatch stating that after the US ban on oil exports, the Japanese wanted to conserve gasoline and abandoned large-scale bombing of Chongqing. (14th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing – Yesterday afternoon, 36 Japanese aircraft, divided into three teams, attacked the western suburbs of Chongqing and the south bank of the Yangtze River. It is reported that three were shot down by the Chinese. The Japanese used super-giant bombs, so the damage was considerable. The sound of the explosions caused eardrums to ache for those in air raid shelters half a mile away. One air raid shelter was hit by a bomb, and rocks fell, but only two people were slightly injured. The American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions in the western suburbs suffered heavy property damage. Its hospital and nurses' dormitory were completely destroyed, and the church school building was also severely damaged due to many bombs falling in the courtyard. The Japanese aircraft had attacked the church the day before (Thursday). The daytime attack took place at noon, and a total of 46 Japanese aircraft attacked the western suburbs of Chongqing and the south bank of the Yangtze River. The night attack began at 7:45 PM, but only three Japanese aircraft attacked. On Thursday during the day, six Japanese light bombers dived and attacked, opening machine guns at low altitude. The Shishi Xinbao office and the residence of foreigners in Jialing Dashun were damaged. Seven bombs fell near the residence of British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr. Thursday's dive bombing was the first time Japanese aircraft had done this in Chongqing, which is noteworthy. The Japanese began using light bombers on Thursday, carrying small bombs and quickly flying over Chongqing, taking only 45 minutes to fly from the Sichuan border to Chongqing. They came in small teams, whereas in the past, each attack always had 27 or 36 aircraft. But on Thursday during the day, they were divided into three teams of nine, eleven, and sixteen aircraft.

<h3>Hunan Strictly Prohibits Rice Merchants from Hoarding and Speculating</h3>
<p>Changsha – The counties along Hunan's lake region have always been known as rice-producing areas, and another bumper harvest has been reported this year, to the delight of everyone. Chairman Xue Yue, fearing that the market would manipulate food prices and that unscrupulous merchants would hoard and speculate, has specially formulated three measures for food control and issued them to the entire province for compliance. (1) The price of grain in the counties along the lake region is set at between 5.5 and 6 yuan per stone, and no increase is allowed. (2) The amount of food allowed to be stored by civilians is set at six stone per person. Grain merchants are allowed to regularly store and trade food, limited to 150 stone. Anything beyond that must be sold. (3) At least 80 percent of the public grain in the counties along the lake region should be purchased by the government. Anyone who dares to deliberately violate the above three measures will be charged with treason and aiding the enemy. In addition, Xue issued a personal order, stating that low grain prices hurt farmers, while high grain prices hurt the people. A balance between the two must be found so that both producers and consumers can benefit. He encouraged farmers and grain merchants to not aim to get rich and enjoy themselves in the midst of difficulties, but to aim for coexistence. (14th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Military Political Department Drama Troupe Responds to Aircraft Donation Campaign</h3>

<h3>United States Training Border Patrol Troops; Special School Established in El Paso</h3>
<p>Washington - The U.S. Immigration Border Patrol is currently working hard to prevent the intrusion of foreign nationals and the "Fifth Column." The border patrol currently has 856 soldiers, but since the U.S. Congress passed a bill last month to recruit an additional 712 reserve soldiers, El Paso, Texas, as well as places in Mexico and Canada, are all training this talent. Currently, the El Paso school has several hundred people undergoing training. Each training class at the school is set for 100 people, and after these 100 people are trained, another 100 people are trained in rotation. Preliminary training is held on the border. It is expected that all trainees will be able to serve by the end of this month, and border patrol activities will soon be strengthened. Border patrol troops will be stationed at key points on railways and highways. This system of border patrol was established in Europe in 1928. The difference is that today's organization of these soldiers is much more advanced than in the past, and the equipment is also more perfect. The patrol team now has 500 fast cars, 14 speedboats, wireless equipment on the border, wireless lookout towers, and three quad-rotor aircraft. More than 100,000 types of fingerprints of foreign nationals are on file. If the situation deteriorates, thousands of U.S. Customs inspection teams and ranch patrol teams can rush to the border within one day to strengthen defenses. (14th International Dispatch)</p>

<h3>German Army and Air Force Commander-in-Chief Once in France; Intensifying Offensive Against Britain; British Military and Civilians Strengthen in Face of Danger; Arouse Anger and Resolve to Fight to the End</h3>
<p>Basel, Switzerland - According to a Berlin dispatch received by the "National Daily" here, German Army Commander-in-Chief General von Brauchitsch and his staff have now met with Air Force Commander-in-Chief Goering somewhere on the French coast. People in Berlin generally expect the attack on Britain to intensify, as the previous attacks were only the first stage of the offensive. (14th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Berlin - The "Boersen" newspaper here predicted yesterday that Germany would launch an offensive against Britain immediately after the air raids on the British Isles. This is said to be the first time a German newspaper has made such a strong prediction. (14th United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>London - The British people engaged in the war were very calm last night to await the attacks launched by Hitler. The King, Queen, and British people have all jointly experienced the taste of air raids, which is truly unprecedented. The German plan, as the German newspapers vowed, is to drive the British royal family out of London and separate them from the British people. However, the result is contrary to the Germans' expectations. Every Briton, especially the homeless, feels that the King and Queen are also suffering the same danger as the common people. Since Edward's abdication, the nation's pro-war royal family sentiment has become stronger than before. Everyone believes that Hitler's policy is truly terrifying. British officials say that because Germany cannot defeat the British air force, it is now trying to win by undermining British public opinion. Hospitals, museums, and residences are being bombed as much as military targets. German bombers have used high-explosive bombs, incendiary bombs, Molotov cocktails, and deep-penetrating aerial torpedoes. Millions of Londoners have tasted the fear of screaming bombs in the streets. They have learned how to jump out of bed in a hurry to extinguish the incendiary bombs thrown into their homes and how to leave their homes to avoid the explosion of time bombs. Despite these hardships, the spirit of Londoners is by no means discouraged. The people of London are indeed deeply annoyed by the bombing, but this usually gentle nation has gradually become angry and determined. Workers working in factories continue their work despite repeated air raid alarms and various unexpected difficulties. Even if their homes are often bombed and the supply of water and electricity is sometimes disrupted, women continue their business and housework with composure. The determination of the people has reached its peak. The government led by Prime Minister Churchill also firmly believes that it is not only able to cope with Germany's blitzkrieg but also to cope with Italy's large-scale attacks in Africa. Although various suggestions have been made to ask the government to move away from London, the government has decided to stay in London to the end. (14th United Press Dispatch)</p>
<h3>British Government Denies Relocation of Capital</h3>
<p>London - The German claim that the King and Queen intend to leave London has been strongly denied here. The King and Queen, the Prime Minister, and other government officials have now fully decided to continue to stay in London. The Information Department recently issued a press release on the matter, saying that enemy radio stations have reported that the British government, the royal family, and the diplomatic corps will all withdraw from London. This news is absolutely unfounded. The origin of this rumor of the enemy is obviously based on the news released by the London representative of the Columbia Broadcasting Corporation. The interviewer has now asked us to declare on his behalf that the German interpretation of his remarks is completely misunderstanding its meaning. His original text is as follows: "Plans to leave London have been in preparation for more than a year, but I do not believe that serious consideration has been given to this step at present. The King and the government are currently in London, and unless the city becomes untenable, I believe they will stay." Therefore, the German report is deliberately reversing what the interviewer said. The Germans also reported that the diplomatic corps is now considering issuing a note to the British Foreign Office on the matter of evacuating London, which is only denied here.

<h3>The Current Air War in Britain Has Become a War of Main Forces; The Success or Failure of Britain's All-Out Resistance Hinges on This; The Old-Fashioned Naval and Land Battles Are Now a Thing of the Past</h3>
<p>—A Warning Uttered by an American Military Expert—</p>
<p>New York - The well-known aviation expert and aircraft manufacturer Seversky, who commanded the Russian Royal Air Force in the previous European war, and whose aircraft and other contributions planned by Seversky are used in the current U.S. defense equipment. Seversky recently published an article saying that the "British War" can be resolved only by air combat, and does not necessarily require land invasion. Seversky's article stated that the huge air battles currently taking place in the skies over the British Isles are by no means a preliminary competition, as the old-fashioned military experts call it. This war is already a major duel. Anyone who wants to understand the importance of the current situation of the Anglo-German war must recognize this point. The military actions currently reported are generally regarded as the prelude to actual invasions or other large-scale naval and land attacks. However, the fact is by no means the case. What we are witnessing now is the real war. If Britain suffers defeat in the current war, then it will suffer the defeat of the entire war, or at least the defeat of the entire war in the motherland. If Britain fails, whether the victor decides to continue with the invasion of the island nation, or simply use the air force to systematically destroy this island nation without adopting other methods, is already a militarily insignificant issue. The reason why people in the world do not fully understand this situation is because they have failed to fully understand the form of the Anglo-German war currently in progress. This is the first time in the history of warfare that a pure and single air war has been discovered. Old-fashioned naval and army personnel do not know that the navy and army have now become onlookers in the fierce air war. It should be known that naval battles and land battles have evolved into unprecedented large-scale air wars, and the victory or defeat of the war seems to be determined by air battles. As for the general belief that 50 U.S. destroyers are enough to save Britain, it is also committing the same error due to seeking to understand this important air war. It should be known that the dangerous outcome can be determined without the navy engaging in war. Those who do not understand the tactics of 1940 all believe that the old-fashioned war will follow this air war. Therefore, it is said that Germany's attack on Britain at this time is only the preparatory stage for a future regular land conquest war. But in fact, some new things will immediately become clear, and those who do not understand the true meaning of air warfare will recognize the power of this new weapon. When the problem of winning the skies over the British Isles and the coastal skies is accurately answered, it can be known that the assistance of the land and air forces is very weak. In my opinion, Britain's allies at this time seem to be able to avoid expressing fear. The aerial offensive is developing as people expected. The challenger has a numerical advantage, while the defender has a substantial advantage. Judging from the news currently reported, the Germans do not seem to have broken through the British defense line. Unless Hitler's air force can cause extremely serious damage to the British mainland in daytime air raids, we have no reason to be afraid. In my opinion, the term "blitzkrieg" is very inappropriate for the air war currently in progress. The term "siege" to describe the tactics at this time is much more appropriate than the absurd "blitzkrieg" label. Britain is now protected by aerial fortresses on all sides, and the attackers are exerting their strength in an attempt to break through them. In every siege in the past, the number of aircraft of the besieged was far less than that of the attacking enemy. Each time was like another war to deal with the siege. The besieged were subjected to great pressure and were overworked in the danger of continuing to consume manpower and resources, and worked hard to maintain the spirit of resistance under pressure. Therefore, the aerial barriers and nerves of British aviators have undoubtedly been supporting them with all their strength. If there is a sudden change in the weather, such as clouds and fog that do not dissipate in the air for several days, it may be beneficial to Britain, because it can enable Britain to repair its aircraft and allow the long-fought personnel to rest slightly to prepare for future fierce battles. The purpose of this siege, in general, is nothing more than (1) to actually occupy Britain, (2) to implement an air blockade to trap the British in distress, or (3) to destroy all industries and transportation. However, in any case, the prerequisite for the Nazi Party is to eliminate or weaken the British Royal Air Force. Hitler's greatest air power has not yet been proven to have this ability, so it is still too early to talk about victory or defeat. No matter what damage the southeastern ports of Britain suffer, as long as Britain can still control the skies over Britain, the Nazis will not be able to achieve a decisive result. If the skies over Britain are still under British control, the Nazi troops will be useless even if they land. If Britain cannot control its airspace, then the Nazis can conquer Britain without sending troops to land, because the gateway to Britain has already been opened and there is no ability to resist the arbitrary killings carried out by the Germans from the air. This aerial war cannot be concluded in a few weeks or a few months, and it will make people realize that aerial power can defeat the enemy without occupying land. However, we in the United States should take this terrible fact as a lesson and seek ways to ensure national security. The sooner this is realized, the more beneficial it will be to the country.

<h3>Italian-German Military Mission Active in Syria, Attempting to Obtain Naval and Air Bases</h3>
<p>Cairo - According to Beirut news in the newspapers here, the activities of the Italian military mission in Syria show the purpose of the Axis policy, which is to exploit all the means of resistance in Syria, so that Italy can take and have Syria as soon as possible. Germany and Italy seem to want to use Syria and Lebanon as their military bases to attack the Near East. The Syrian people are therefore greatly angered and determined to resist the Axis countries' attempt to achieve this goal. The British and Turkish governments are closely watching the development of the situation in Syria. (14th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Cairo - According to reliable information from Syria received by Reuters, the French in Syria are now increasingly inclined towards General de Gaulle. This growing trend is aided by two reasons: one is the bravery shown by Britain during the German air raids, and the other is the response of the French tropical territories in Africa to de Gaulle. Although newspapers cannot freely express themselves, the French in Syria have managed to find foreign news. There are signs of dissatisfaction with the Petain government in Syria. It is reported that after the first batch of Italian military experts arrived in Syria, civilian and air force experts will also go there. It is also reported that a German mission has also set out for Syria and has now arrived in Istanbul. Anti-Italian sentiment in Syria is increasing day by day. It is reported that the French are strongly rejecting Italian demands. The Italian demands on Syria include (1) immediately handing over air bases, (2) handing over railway management rights, and (3) handing over several French submarines docked in the port of Beirut. In a nutshell, the situation in Syria has now reached a boiling point. Its future actions will be no more than two paths: (1) a sudden coup by the de Gaulle party, or (2) individual passive resistance. The so-called passive resistance is to refuse to disarm and wait for the opportunity for military action. (14th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>London - Germany's aerial blitzkrieg on London is becoming increasingly fierce. Last night, the city was subjected to the fifth attack in 24 hours. The most recent air raid began at 8:02 p.m. on the 13th (5:02 a.m. Shanghai time today) and had not been lifted by midnight. London was attacked all night, covered by almost constant artillery fire. In 24 hours, German aircraft flew over the city for 14 and a half hours. The air raid records are as follows: From 8 p.m. to 4:55 a.m. on the night of the 12th to the 13th, from 6:37 a.m. to 7:32 a.m. on the 13th, from 8:40 a.m. to 12:50 p.m., from 2:55 p.m. to 3:13 p.m., and from 8:02 p.m. onwards, the alarm has not yet been lifted.</p>
<p>During last night's air raid, the sky was clear, the moon was silver, and the anti-aircraft guns around London were firing fiercely. The explosion of the shells emitted dark red and yellowish-white flashes. Several enemy planes flew past the outer line and sneaked into the central area of London. Within a few minutes, there were no pedestrians on the street. Only shrapnel was falling, or whizzing past the windows. The glass was shattered. After a while, the roar became louder, and the anti-aircraft guns also opened fire, mixed with lighter artillery fire, rumbling together. The sentiments of this air raid can only be known after the alarm is lifted and reports are collected from the bombed areas.</p>
<p>During the daytime raid yesterday, one German plane dropped three bombs in London after the alarm was lifted, near a certain hospital and a certain sanatorium, injuring two people. Another bomb destroyed six houses and a public library, injuring eight people.</p>
<p>During the second air raid in London yesterday, a bakery and a laundry, each employing hundreds of people, were hit by bombs, but there were no deaths or injuries, because the employees all took refuge in air-raid shelters, and although the houses were partially destroyed, the air-raid shelters were unharmed. During the third air raid, an enemy plane dived towards London, and after a while, it rose and dropped high-explosive bombs and incendiary bombs, causing houses to catch fire. Dozens of pedestrians in the road lay prone on the roadside, and some ran to air-raid shelters. Another enemy plane swooped down from the low clouds and dropped five bombs in a certain area in the southeast. The gas pipe was blown up, but the fire was immediately extinguished. A communiqué from the Air Ministry stated that according to the detailed reports received, although enemy aircraft dropped bombs in many places during the attack on Britain on the 12th, there was no serious damage. The number of deaths and injuries in the London area due to the air raid on the night of the 11th was 110 deaths and 260 injuries. Yesterday afternoon, in addition to attacking London, enemy aircraft in squads dropped bombs in several places in the southeast. A certain town in the Essex area was bombed and slightly damaged, but no deaths or injuries were reported. Several civilian houses were destroyed, but in general, the extent of the damage and casualties was quite small. Yesterday, enemy aircraft adopted the method of suddenly attacking and quickly flying back, and dropped bombs in a certain place in central London and several places in Kent. There were not many casualties, but the details are currently unknown. (14th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>London - It is now learned that the British House of Lords was hit by an incendiary bomb during the recent air raid and was slightly damaged, but the fire was quickly extinguished. (14th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Bombs Fall Near St. Paul's Cathedral; Northern Ireland Attacked by Air for the First Time</h3>
<p>London - Yesterday, several mechanical engineers risked their lives to prevent the explosion of a "time bomb." The bomb fell near St. Paul's Cathedral and could have seriously damaged the historically famous building. The Press Association stated that a total of five unexploded bombs fell near St. Paul's Cathedral, one of which was a 500-pound bomb. Now, the area around the cathedral is cordoned off and heavily guarded. (14th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>London - Northern Ireland was attacked by air for the first time since the start of the war yesterday. A batch of German aircraft dropped several incendiary bombs on the coastal town of Keijin in Northern Ireland, causing several fires, but they were quickly extinguished. According to the announcement, the damage was very light and there were no casualties. Ships off the coast of Northern Ireland were also attacked, but to no effect. (14th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Time Bomb Exploded This Morning; Large Stone Pillar of Buckingham Palace Collapsed</h3>
<p>London - A time bomb, one of the five bombs that fell near Buckingham Palace last night, suddenly exploded this morning. A large stone pillar of the palace gate, along with a part of the iron railing in front of the palace gate, was completely destroyed. The bomb fell in the middle of Buckingham Palace and the Victoria Memorial. After it was discovered last night, sandbags were immediately piled around it to reduce its explosive power. As a result, the Victoria Memorial was not damaged, and the doors and windows of the palace were not shattered. (14th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>British Aircraft Attack German Military Targets in Adverse Weather; Destroy Railway Transportation and Blow Up Warehouses; Inflict a Serious Blow to Germany's Invasion Plan</h3>
<p>London - On the night of the 12th and the early morning of the 13th, large British bomber squadrons attacked German military targets. The extremely important railway intersection and warehouses in western Germany were heavily damaged, and Germany's invasion plan was once again dealt a serious blow. British aircraft took to the air for hundreds of miles, braving adverse weather, and achieved considerable success. Some of the bombed warehouses are the largest and best-equipped in Europe, and they must have a significant relationship with Germany's attempt to invade Britain. The deployment of troops and military supplies that Germany is moving westward to the ports of the English Channel must pass through these important transportation centers. The Air Ministry stated that the first batch of British aircraft arrived in Hamm before 10 p.m., braving dense clouds and rain, and dropped huge bombs and incendiary bombs on the warehouses. The warehouses in Elan, near the Luxembourg border, were attacked. A column of trucks was hit by huge bombs, causing several explosions, and the fire was raging. The avenue south of the warehouse was also hit by bombs, exploding loudly. Two British bombers flew to Osnabrück, attacked through dense clouds, causing ten large fires in the warehouses. The warehouses and railways in Essen, Schwert, and Emmerlek were also attacked. Recently, German military transport passing through the warehouses in Brussels has been frequent. They were attacked by the British Air Force several times last week, and they were bombed again on the night of the 12th. As soon as huge bombs were dropped, continuous explosions were seen in the target area. A fire broke out on the north side of a warehouse, about one mile long. The explosion emitted green light, followed by another fire, about 200 yards long. At the same time, another batch of British aircraft flew to Emden to bomb the shipyards and gasoline depots for one hour. The head of the port and the ships were also bombed. After the gasoline depot was hit, thick smoke billowed in several places, and the flames soared. The British aircraft attacking Vlissingen saw that there were anti-aircraft gun defense ships arranged in a semicircle at the entrance of the port, and they bombarded them fiercely. The light and heavy artillery teams and anti-aircraft machine guns on the shore also opened fire at the same time. The British aircraft bombed fiercely, braving this fierce fire net. One of them flew low to 600 feet and dropped bombs, hitting the shipyard. The armory was probably also hit, because the fire was raging and the explosion was extremely loud. The British aircraft turned around and flew back to sea. Even twenty miles away, the fire could still be seen flashing. (14th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>British Navy Can Use American Bases; American Naval Experts Speculate</h3>
<p>Washington - Naval experts and diplomatic experts here, after special research, expressed their opinions, saying that they firmly believe that if the British Navy is driven out by the German invasion and cannot stand in its own territorial waters, then the main ships of the British fleet will obtain the right to use one or more U.S. naval bases on the Atlantic this winter. Reliable diplomatic circles say that it would not be surprising even if this negotiation is "about to be concluded." It is expected that the fuel supply docks of the naval shipyards in Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and Norfolk are all needed by Britain, because these are the only places in the naval bases in the Western Hemisphere that have the equipment to supply main battleships. The government leaders do not want to leave behind a handle for such a major event, so when asked, they often answer, "Please ask the White House." However, President Roosevelt also refused to give a direct answer to this question when he received reporters yesterday. (14th International Dispatch)</p>
<h3>London Citizens Have Not Slept for Seven Nights</h3>
<p>Madrid - According to a report from London, when the fourth alarm in London was issued last night, the citizens were informed that it was the seventh sleepless night. During the previous three air raids, the citizens were unwilling to run into the cellars, but after hearing that many people were killed by bombs in the docks, they had to go into the air-raid shelters. Yesterday, many factories and warehouses in London were hit by bombs and caught fire. Several cities on the southeast coast of England also had bombs dropped, but the British authorities checked the news very strictly, and the situation is unknown. (14th Huitong Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Soviet Rights on the Danube River: Germany Willing to Respect Them; Navigation Talks to Invite Soviet Participation; Germany and Italy Prepare to Protect Romanian Borders</h3>
<p>Berlin – Sources well-informed in German circles here declared yesterday that Germany will accept the Soviet government's warning and recognize that the Soviet Union is a country bordering the Danube River. All resolutions concerning the Danube River region should invite Soviet participation. A German spokesperson said, "We are aware that there are no difficult problems to be faced in this matter, and we absolutely respect all the rights of the Soviet Union as a Danube River nation." The spokesperson did not feel that the Soviet Union's protest to Romania regarding border conflicts was particularly important. He stated, "Whenever there are changes in border lines, small frictions easily arise. We sincerely hope to resolve this matter before encountering significant difficulties." (United Press dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>Berlin – The "German Diplomatic Political Correspondence," mouthpiece of the German Foreign Ministry, commented on the end of the Danube River International Commission, believing that the Western powers could no longer intervene in the Danube River issue. The safety of international navigation on the Danube River should be guaranteed as much as possible, but this work cannot be competently handled by politicians and should be managed by experts in order to maintain Central Europe's transportation. (Haitong dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>Bucharest – The arrival of high-ranking German and Italian generals in Curtea de Argeș and the arrival of Italian officials in Galați indicate that the Axis powers are preparing to protect the Romanian border in accordance with the Vienna Agreement. After the establishment of the German-Soviet Bessarabian agreement, German officials and stormtroopers were stationed in Galați to protect the evacuation of German nationals. Some believe that the reason for the arrival of Axis officials here may be related to the Soviet Union's request for Germany to explain its intentions regarding the Danube River region. (Associated Press dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>Bucharest – The Soviet Union sent a note to Romania protesting the border incident that occurred on Wednesday, and anxieties regarding the strain in Soviet-Romanian relations have increased. The poor border situation has persisted for several weeks, and there have long been rumors that the Soviet side has massed large forces along the new border of the Prut River. Another noteworthy development is the appearance of 1,500 uniformed German personnel near the Danube port of Galați. They have come here ostensibly to handle the evacuation of the German minorities in the Soviet-occupied provinces of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina. However, political circles here point out that the Soviet Union's actions towards Germany regarding the Danube River are the first instance of conflict with Germany because what the Soviet Union says contradicts the German claim that Romania's existing territories are all within Germany's economic sphere. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>Bucharest – Romanian political circles deeply believe that Berlin, having already assumed the role of Romania's protector, will certainly relieve Romania of its difficulties. They are not concerned about the Soviet Union's protest last night regarding the border conflict. Official circles believe that even though the Soviet Union has sent a note to Berlin requesting detailed information about the Vienna Conference, especially regarding the Danube River issue, there will be no disputes between Germany and the Soviet Union. They also claim that the German-Soviet talks regarding the exchange of Bessarabian populations have significantly improved relations, which is completely contrary to what is being reported abroad.

<h3>Romanian News: Postponement of Cabinet Formation; King Appointed Division Commander</h3>

Currently, the Iron Guard has reached an understanding with General Antonescu. It is said that Brătianu will be appointed Foreign Minister, and the current Foreign Minister, Manolescu, may be transferred to the post of Minister of Economy or may serve as the ambassador to Germany.

<h3>Hungarian Troops Complete Takeover of Romanian Ceded Territory; Boundary Demarcation Talks to Begin</h3>
<p>Budapest – Hungary announced the completion of the takeover of the Outer Transylvanian territory yesterday.

<h3>United States to Establish Naval Base in Brazil; Roosevelt Preparing to Negotiate with Brazil</h3>
<p>Washington – Only the blind would say today that the United States is not rapidly preparing to participate in the world war. Various policies to avoid war have all developed into policies trending towards war. According to subtle official revelations, after President Roosevelt negotiates with Britain and Canada for the lease of bases, he will tour the southern states for political activities and then return to negotiate with Brazil to establish a US naval base in Brazil to defend the South Atlantic. The President's advisors are currently designing a "quarter-of-the-globe" defense system. It is rumored that an inner defensive line will be drawn in the Western Hemisphere, starting from Newfoundland, extending to a new naval base near Natal, Brazil, and then turning west, passing through Hawaii and reaching Alaska to protect half of the American coastline. The importance of the Brazilian base is due to the fact that whoever can control that area can control the vital passage from the east. The United States' second step policy will be to make greater use of the American fleet to bolster Britain's power. No one in the American army and navy doubts this. The larger American battleships and cruisers are maneuvering in the Pacific Ocean, which can now embolden Britain. If Britain is defeated before the natural development of American assistance, then the United States can take over the defense of Canada and join in. Only if Britain wins can the United States be spared. An American official made a bet that the United States would definitely participate in the war within four months. An American ambassador also said this. (International News Service dispatch, 15th)</p>
<h3>Famous Japanese Writer Vigorously Condemns Opportunism; Opposes Reckless Actions</h3>
<p>Tokyo – The Nichinichi Shimbun recently published an article by the famous commentator Tokutomi Iichirō, vehemently denouncing those who advocate an opportunistic approach to Japanese foreign policy. He stated, "If Japan were to take advantage of Britain's preoccupation with the war against Germany and seize its interests in the Far East, this would be morally wrong and a reckless action. It should be known that taking advantage of others in distress to obtain benefits should be a source of shame for both countries and individuals. The small countries of the Balkan Peninsula, such as Romania, are accustomed to using this strategy to defend themselves and increase their value, but the result is ultimately failure. Romania's tragic dismemberment can serve as a warning. Certain strategists in our country believe that Germany's attack on Britain will gradually weaken Britain's power in the Far East, and Japan can take this opportunity to dominate East Asia at a minimal cost. We will leave this point aside for now, but what can be asserted is that Germany's intensification of pressure will only make Britain bow down to the United States and exchange all its wealth for American assistance. If Britain is forced to move its capital to Canada, then Hong Kong and Singapore will fall into the hands of the Americans. In short, the international situation is becoming increasingly dangerous, and our country's future difficulties will only increase." (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>

<h3>Random Notes on the European War (6): From Paris to Bordeaux</h3>
<p>This is a report of France's total collapse, in two parts. The first part was written by a former Paris correspondent for the British Manchester Guardian, originally published in the newspaper's weekly edition on June 28. The second part was sent from Lisbon by Ralph Delahaye Paine, head of the European branch of the American "Life" magazine, originally published in "Life" on July 8. The translations are presented separately below:</p>
<p>A British Newspaper's Record</p>
<p>Early morning on June 11th, I left Paris and later stayed in Tours and Bordeaux, France. I witnessed the residents of Paris, young and old, fleeing to the countryside, a truly tragic scene. I was in Tours during a bombing. Although I was not strafed by German planes along the way, I spoke with many refugees and learned that the extent of German planes killing refugees along the way in France was clearly incomparable to the experiences of refugees in other areas.</p>
<p>I lived in Paris for fourteen years and have a deep affection for Paris and its residents. Hearing that the German army would arrive at any moment, I had no choice but to flee in a panic. My heart was burning when I set off, and I was filled with countless emotions. My poor writing cannot describe even a fraction of it. I suddenly rushed to leave, leaving behind 5,000 books, which is nothing compared to other losses. Even leaving behind helpless friends in Paris is just a trivial matter in the midst of a great disaster.</p>
<p>I will never forget my last night in Paris. That day, the sun was blazing, the weather was muggy, and thousands of cars were leaving the city in a continuous stream all day long. In the afternoon, the main roads were still extremely congested. I decided to take a walk on the streets one last time and saw that the Avenue de l'Opéra was as normal as ever, which was quite surprising. The shops along the road were still stocked with goods, and one cinema was still showing movies non-stop. I walked into a familiar coffee shop, but the owner had left, leaving only an old, overweight waiter in charge. The waiter greeted me with a smile and said that he expected the German army to enter Paris within forty-eight hours, but there was nothing to worry about because he had been captured by the German army during the last war and knew how to deal with fools.</p>
<p>By evening, the situation had completely changed. I drove from the Place de l'Opéra, through streets deserted by pedestrians, to Saint-Cloud, preparing to join three cars heading south to Tours. On the way, I saw a team of soldiers, dressed in tattered uniforms, lacking discipline, and many were drunk and shouting loudly. At sunset, the red light shone all over Paris, and there was a rare and strange black smoke covering the sky.</p>
<p>After arriving at a friend's residence on the summit of Saint-Cloud, I had an unobstructed view of Paris. After packing my luggage, I invited a friend to the balcony to look down, but we couldn't see anything because Paris was covered in a black smoke screen. This was clearly the smoke screen used by the German army that day to forcibly cross the Seine River, drifting east to the sky above Paris.</p>
<p>I will not go into detail about the journey from Paris to Tours, but will only describe the general outline. Normally, this journey would take three hours, but it took us fourteen hours to reach Tours. For the first twenty miles, military vehicles, various cars, and bicycles were everywhere, making it extremely difficult to drive. It took more than an hour to pass through Versailles. All around, it was dark, the car was bumpy, and the sound of wheels rumbled. The lights were dim, mixed with the shouts of military police, creating a chaotic scene. This was the sight of residents rushing to other places. After passing through Rambouillet, driving became a little easier and we entered the Beauce plain.</p>
<p>The villagers looked confused as cars loaded with boxes passed by in succession. Several roads were blocked by anti-tank guns, and in the woods were soldiers with weary faces, holding rifles and watching out for paratroopers. By the time we reached Chartres, the cathedral stood majestically, presenting a unique beauty of peace in the midst of the French people's suffering, but everyone we saw looked panicked and at a loss.</p>
<p>We soon arrived in Tours, and the scene we saw was like a nightmare. The streets and alleys were crowded with people, making it unbelievable. Houses and hotels were all overcrowded. Journalists, politicians, and familiar faces gathered in the cafes along the Rue Nationale. Small blue trams, ringing their bells, drove across the Pont de Pierre. Cars loaded with luggage came and went. It was said that the National Assembly would soon convene in Tours, and the authorities had requisitioned two hotels to serve as the meeting places for the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies. The Ministry of Information was located in a dilapidated old building.</p>
<p>We stayed in Tours for two days. By the third day, government officials were gradually disappearing. By noon, everyone had left, but we still stayed in Tours for another twenty-four hours. The Ministry of Information stopped repairing the walls halfway and abandoned them. On the afternoon of our last day in Tours, we were suddenly bombed. Twelve bombers flew low and dropped bombs, many of which fell near the airfield. We encountered another air raid the next morning.</p>
<p>The journey to Bordeaux was relatively peaceful. Most of the refugee cars had already passed, so driving was unobstructed. The scene in Bordeaux was extremely gloomy, with a slight sense of panic. It was known that the French government was holding an emergency meeting somewhere in Bordeaux and that Churchill had arrived in Bordeaux, but there was no definite news. Postal and telegraph censorship and telegraphic communication had almost stopped. Whether it was the local newspapers or the newspapers that had moved to Tours for a few days and then moved to Bordeaux, the news was very isolated. Even the fall of Paris was only announced vaguely, causing rumors to spread.</p>
<p>What was clear was that Reynaud at least wanted to continue fighting in North Africa, but those who advocated surrender were gaining momentum. The British expatriates in Bordeaux were quite anxious because if France signed an armistice, and the German army occupied the Atlantic port of Bordeaux in one night, what would happen? British expatriates went to the British Consulate to inquire about news in an endless stream. The British authorities finally informed the British expatriates to prepare to evacuate. The next day, we drove to Pointe de Grave at the mouth of the Gironde River, which was where the first American troops landed in 1917. After eating our meal under the monument, we were as heavy as lead, and we left French soil. We took a boat to board a British ship outside the harbor. The ship was originally designed to accommodate only 150 passengers, but thanks to the captain and crew's skillful handling, it carried no fewer than 1,500 passengers, and we were able to return to England safely.</p>
<p>After boarding the ship, a German bomber attacked again. The next day, another bomber flew overhead and was chased away, and it was shot down nearby. Just as our ship and another ship left French territorial waters, a destroyer arrived to escort us. At this last moment, looking back at the French coast, in the setting sun and golden rays, it gradually faded away until it was indistinguishable.</p>

<h3>American Authorities Advocate Maintaining Concessions and Courts Japanese Merchants Also Do Not Want Courts to Change First Special Court Denies Making Statements</h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of the Shanghai courts, there have been many rumors recently. In reality, it seems that fewer of these messages come from the court itself, and more come from general speculation. According to reliable sources, the court is a state agency for the implementation of laws and has a critical relationship. The special district courts of the two concessions in Shanghai, in particular, are bound by agreements, and their position and responsibilities are closely linked to international operations. It is not appropriate for any party to make separate claims. The United States is a democratic country. At this time of global turmoil, it upholds justice and speaks out loudly. In the Far East, it adheres to its open-door policy as always. The White House executive will either not express anything about East Asia, or if it does, it will definitely take the actual implementation of the Far Eastern policy as its consistent and unchanging statement. Therefore, American authorities firmly advocate maintaining the status quo of the Shanghai Concession Court. If there are no drastic international changes, this statement is hardly questionable, and it is also unquestionable. Furthermore, the number of Japanese commercial firms that trade with Chinese has increased more than before the war. With frequent interactions, there are naturally many legal lawsuits. In the event of a change in the court, it would be very inconvenient based on past practices. Therefore, most Japanese merchants advocate protecting Chinese courts and are in a very dominant position.</p>
<p>Judges Rarely Ask About Foreign Affairs</p>
<p>Court officials, in addition to their own responsibilities, rarely ask about foreign affairs. It is even more inappropriate for them to publicly make statements or express opinions. Recently, Chinese and foreign newspapers in Shanghai have reported court news, sometimes in the form of direct statements from the court, or in a tone that indicates the actions of the entire court. According to reliable sources, all such statements were not made by the person in charge of the court, so the court cannot be responsible for them.</p>
<p>First Special Court Important Statement</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Shanghai First Special District Court sent a letter to this newspaper yesterday, saying: "To whom it may concern, in the past two or three days, the Chinese and English newspapers in this city have repeatedly published important news about our court, and some self-proclaimed staff members have made statements without authorization. The source of the interviews is unknown, and who made them is unknown. Regardless of how the events are described, how the words are phrased, or what the intention is, our court cannot be responsible for them. This statement is made specifically, and please publish the original text of this statement in a prominent position in the Xinlian column of your newspaper so that the public is aware of it. Sincerely, Shanghai First Special District Court, Jiangsu, September 14, 29th year."</p>
<p>Most Judges Move Into the Court</p>
<p>According to news this morning (14th), many court judges and other officials in the Shanghai Concession have moved into the court to live. It is reported that almost all judges and officials will move into the heavily guarded court dormitories within a few days. According to one official, the reason why the judges have adopted this method is that they have repeatedly received threatening letters, and because the court seal is tightly guarded and it is difficult for idlers to sneak in, this decision is considered the safest method at present. At the same time, the police department is continuing to implement precautionary measures to protect the judges.</p>
<h3>Two Deputy Directors of the Municipal Council Took Over Yesterday Cobb Left This Morning</h3>
<p>Cobb, the Deputy Director of the Municipal Council, officially resigned from his position as Director of the Municipal Council yesterday. The newly appointed Acting Deputy Directors, Mr. Nash and Mr. Allen, also took over and assumed office yesterday, but there was no inauguration ceremony. However, they have begun to handle the routine official duties left by Cobb since yesterday. As for Cobb, he personally went to various departments of the Municipal Council yesterday morning to bid farewell. It is reported that Cobb will leave Shanghai by ship next week and go to Malaya to join the army and serve the country.</p>
<h3>Many Foreign Banknotes are Exported</h3>
<p>According to customs news, many foreign banknotes are exported, but very few are imported. From January to July of this year, 10,815 pounds of British banknotes were exported, but none were imported.</p>
<h3>American Military and Political Officers Had Important Discussions Yesterday Many Believe They Were Discussing the Handover Problem Official Secrets Were Strictly Guarded Regarding the Content of the Discussions</h3>
<p>The issue of the American Defense Forces taking over the central district of the Public Concession is still being discussed by the American military and political officers stationed in Shanghai. A reporter from Pingming News Agency learned from reliable sources yesterday that the American military and political officers stationed in Shanghai still held an important meeting at the American Consulate at 181 Jiangxi Road at around 10 a.m. yesterday. In addition to American Consul General Patrick, those who attended the meeting included Rear Admiral Glassford, Commander of the Yangtze River Fleet, Colonel Baker, Commander of the American Defense Forces Marine Corps stationed in Shanghai, and another senior officer of the American Defense Forces stationed in Shanghai. Colonel Baker was the one who came out after the meeting. This meeting was the second after Admiral Hurd left Shanghai. The reasons for their discussion are absolutely confidential and they do not want to disclose anything. However, according to other relevant sources, the American military and political officers' talks yesterday morning were still an important discussion on the issue of the American military taking over the central district, in order to wait for Admiral Hurd, commander of the American Asian Fleet, to arrive in Shanghai in the near future. Regarding the handover issue, there may be new developments at that time.</p>
<h3>Concessions to Take Special Precautions Starting This Week Expected to Pass September 18th Safely Prevention in the Western District Has Been Particularly Tight in Recent Days</h3>
<p>The authorities of the two concessions in this city, with the "September 18th" anniversary approaching, have been planning, preparing, and arranging in recent days in order to maintain law and order and prevent unexpected incidents, taking precautions to ensure safety. The security measures in the concessions have also become increasingly strict, and special precautions will be taken from this week onwards, before and after the anniversary, with the strictest being on "September 18th." The situation is comparable to "August 13th." At that time, in addition to the full mobilization of police personnel, the defense forces of various countries stationed in Shanghai, such as the United States, France, and Italy, and the Shanghai Volunteer Corps will all be mobilized. Tanks and police vehicles will also be dispatched for patrol. The gaps in the barricaded roads in the central district of the Public Concession will be guarded by more British members of the Volunteer Corps to supplement the defense duties left by the British army. Therefore, it is expected that this "September 18th Anniversary Day" will be able to pass quietly under strict security.</p>
<p>French Concession Obtains Good Order</p>
<p>Since the French Concession announced special precautions on the 3rd of this month, traffic on various barricaded roads has been obstructed. The Zi Lin Western News and others have received letters from readers stating that it is inconvenient and difficult to enter and exit. According to the French Police Department, this measure is purely to ensure good order and maintain law and order within the territory, so it has been decided to continue to take it. Currently, only the barbed wire fence on the Songshan Road Kunlian Aiduoya Road, that is, the east side of the Hu Guang Grand Theater, has been removed. However, armored vehicles have been placed there, and Chinese and Western detectives have been stationed to check pedestrians. Security is still strict.</p>
<p>The Western District is Stepping Up Defenses</p>
<p>The police authorities of the Public Concession and the French Concession, with the anniversary of "September 18th" approaching, have implemented security measures in advance in order to ensure the safety of the Concession's order. Also, because the Western District is close to the badlands, the three iron gates at the entrance of the Yinghua Lane on Roberts Road have been closed, leaving only one empty passage for vehicles to travel back and forth. The intersection of Xinzha Road and Chengdu Road was once closed yesterday (leaving a gap), and a large number of armed police officers were stationed to conduct searches. There were also mixed patrol teams of Chinese, English, and Indian police, armored vehicle teams, and vehicle patrol teams patrolling and searching on various roads in the Western District. The French Concession authorities also strengthened security work in areas such as Changle Road and Xujiahui. The authorities in the central district of the two concessions have also stepped up the necessary measures for the barbed wire mouths and along the way.</p>
<h3>Post Office Cares About Southwest Mail Delivery</h3>
<p>Mail delivery between Shanghai and various places in the Southwest, which was once suspended due to shipping from Shanghai's coastal defense, the Shanghai Postal Administration immediately loaded and opened several batches of Fujian provincial shipping lines to transfer to the inland and road transportation in order to clear the mail. However, taking this route takes far longer than taking the coastal defense route. According to the current transportation situation, mail transferred via the coastal defense takes about three weeks to arrive, while inland road transportation via Xiamen takes more than a month. Therefore, since the resumption of shipping from Shanghai's coastal defense, the post office has still loaded and transported mail to the southwest via coastal defense, which is very smooth. However, recent reports have stated that the Honghe border crossing bridge on the Sino-Vietnamese border has been destroyed. The post office is paying close attention to whether this will affect the Shanghai-to-Haiphong transportation of southwest mail. It is currently eagerly awaiting a report from the Haiphong postal authorities. However, according to the bureau's speculation, even if the bridge is destroyed, there must be ships that can ferry across. If this is the case, the postal route must be able to remain unblocked. Otherwise, the post office will have to consider other transportation routes. As for mail delivery between Shanghai and Zhejiang, most of it is now transferred to the land route via Shipu. The new route has not been abandoned, but only a small number of mails are transported. Shanghai-Fujian mail can now be reached via Fuqing.</p>
<h3>Flat-Price Coal Sales Ended Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Coal Industry Association sold flat-price coal jin from the 9th of this month: (1) Sales to the bath industry for two days, each household purchasing two tons, totaling 102 tons sold. (2) Sales to the cooked water industry for four days, each household limited to one ton, totaling more than 500 tons sold. The period has now expired and ended yesterday. As for the next sale, it is still awaiting a formal decision.</p>
<h3>Filling Out Cargo Lists Be Careful About Ship Capacity</h3>
<p>Jianghai Customs General Affairs Section Notice (1) No. 114 states that, in the case of goods reported for shipment by merchants, if the goods are returned to customs, the shipping agent should immediately notify the boarding officer for the benefit of the reporting person, so that the goods can be confirmed as returned to customs. Otherwise, they will not be allowed to enjoy the benefits of returning the goods. Currently, refrigerated goods, finished tax goods, and perishable goods can be temporarily exempt from this procedure. All merchants, etc., should be informed of this. This notice is hereby given. (2) No. 115 states that, in the case of various shipping companies filling out cargo lists, if they do not consider the ship's capacity and fill them out arbitrarily, causing the reported goods to be returned to customs, they will not be allowed to enjoy the benefits of returning the goods. This matter was notified by this section in Notice No. 32 on March 10, the 23rd year of the Republic of China. If the cargo lists issued by various shipping companies exceed the ship's capacity again in the future, all goods listed in the list will not be allowed to enjoy the benefits of returning the goods if they are returned to customs. Please comply with this. This notice is hereby given.</p>
<h3>Municipal Federation Urges All Industries Not to Dismiss Employees</h3>
<p>Commodities in Shanghai are expensive, and employees in various industries are suffering from livelihood difficulties. In this abolished Lunar Mid-Autumn Festival, personnel changes may be unavoidable. For this reason, the Shanghai Citizens' Federation appeals to the employers in various industries not to dismiss employees without reason, and to continue to improve employee benefits within the scope of their capabilities. At the same time, the association also hopes that the employees in the industry will not easily provoke disputes and will work hard in their respective positions to overcome the difficulties at this time when the Shanghai industry is encountering the most difficult period.</p>
<h3>Thrift and Nation-Building Stamps Sold on Double Tenth Festival</h3>
<p>According to news from the Southwest Post Office, in order to promote thrift and nation-building among the people, the Ministry of Communications ordered the General Post Office to issue a kind of thrift and nation-building commemorative stamp. The style has been designed by the bureau and is extremely beautiful and solemn. The whole set consists of four kinds, each with a different value. The above-mentioned commemorative stamps have been sent to the Hong Kong Qishu Bookstore for printing last month. Recently, sample sheets have been sent to the Kunming Post Office for verification and approval. They can be printed and completed before the Double Tenth Festival and delivered to the whole country for issuance as scheduled. Shanghai can also ship them directly from Hong Kong to Shanghai for sale and add commemorative postmarks.</p>

<h3>Lone Army and White Russian Corps Twice Clashed Workers Repairing the Goal Angered the Lone Army The Two Sides Persisted Until Yesterday and the Problem Was Not Resolved</h3>
<p>The English Great Beauty Evening News said that a brawl occurred at the Singapore Road Lone Army Camp this morning (14th). First, several coolies from the Municipal Council's Public Works Department went to the camp yesterday (13th) to repair the football field gate, which angered the Lone Army soldiers. After Chief Xie agreed that the coolies could go to repair it today, no incident occurred. However, when the coolies from the Public Works Department went to the camp this morning to carry out the repair, they again had a disagreement with the Lone Army soldiers and brawled. The White Russian Corps guarding the camp believed that the situation was serious and could not be handled, so two teams of the White Russian Corps rushed to mediate, and a team of police officers from the Public Concession also arrived to assist. It was heard that as a result of the brawl, several Lone Army soldiers and some coolies from the Public Works Department were injured. The claim that the White Russian Corps fired several shots into the sky to warn them could not be confirmed. An official from the Municipal Council said recently that the authorities are consulting with Chief Xie to end the disturbance, but so far in the afternoon, a satisfactory solution has not been obtained.</p>
<p>Repairing the Goal Caused a Conflict</p>
<p>The Zi Lin News said that at nearly 10:00 a.m. yesterday (13th), soldiers from the Lone Army Camp on Singapore Road and the White Russian Corps guarding the camp almost caused an incident. After mutual concessions from both sides, it finally ended peacefully. The incident occurred at around 9:00 a.m. yesterday when coolies from the Municipal Council's Public Works Department went to the camp to repair the football field gate. Chief Xie</p>
<p>objected, so more than a hundred Lone Army soldiers stood at the entrance of the football field. The coolies had to give up the repair work. Major Mann, the commander of the corps managing the camp, received a report and arrived at the camp a few minutes later, asking Chief Xie to meet him to explain the reasons for the objection. However, Chief Xie refused. Mann saw</p>
<p>that persuasion was ineffective and immediately ordered the commander of the White Russian Corps guarding the camp not to allow anyone to enter or leave the camp until Chief Xie explained his attitude. The Lone Army heard the news and unanimously demanded that visitors be allowed to enter the camp. The commander of the White Russian Corps guarding the camp insisted that he could not disobey the order, which angered the Lone Army, so more than a hundred people rushed into</p>
<p>the courtyard of the barracks of the corps guarding the camp, intending to disarm the White Russian Corps, but it was not carried out. At the same time, the commander of the corps guarding the camp made a phone call to the headquarters of the White Russian Corps, requesting that more corps members be sent to the camp, because the situation was becoming more serious. A small team of the White Russian Corps was immediately dispatched.</p>
<p>Having Arrived at the Camp</p>
<p>Mann had also arrived at the scene and talked with several leaders of the Lone Army. After a long time, he was able to persuade Chief Xie to come out to meet him. After mutual concessions from both sides, the serious situation finally resolved. The small team of the corps that arrived at the camp also left a few minutes later and returned to the headquarters.</p>
<p>Continued to Persist Many People Were Injured</p>
<p>The Fourth Regiment Lone Army Camp on Jiaozhou Road had another conflict with the White Russian Corps at around 9:00 a.m. yesterday, which had not been resolved satisfactorily as of last night. According to a reporter from Pingming News Agency, the conflict was caused by the White Russian Corps setting up barbed wire. It is said that at around 9:00 a.m. yesterday, when the White Russian team was setting up barbed wire at an entrance of the camp, the Lone Army soldiers expressed their dissatisfaction. Both sides</p>
<p>were firm in their attitudes and refused to give in, so they ended up punching each other. The White Russian side also fired tear gas and used fire hydrants to spray the Lone Army soldiers. For a time, the Lone Army barracks became flooded. The police station in charge heard the news and rushed to the scene, and the Italian Defense Forces also dispatched troops to deploy defenses in the Singapore Road area. For a time, the situation was quite tense. The traffic between the Lone Army Camp and the outside world was cut off, and Chief Xie's external telephone was also blocked. The two sides</p>
<p>As a result of the conflict, eight or nine people were injured on the Lone Army side. As of yesterday evening, the dispute was still deadlocked. It is reported that the Municipal Council held negotiations with Chief Xie yesterday regarding this matter, but as of the reporter's deadline, there was no news of any results. According to another source, the conflict was caused by repairing the football field gate, but this could not be confirmed.</p>
<h3>Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee Should Continue to Exist; Evaluation Committee Sends Letter to Authorities Requesting Instructions; Profiteering Brokers to Be Severely Punished by the Court</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee is organized by thirteen rice industry groups, including the Soybean and Grain Industry, the Miscellaneous Grain and Oil Cake Industry, the Rice Store Industry, the Rice Milling Industry, the Sales Industry, the Rice Market Management Committee, the Shanghai North Rice Merchants United Benefit Association, the Changshu Rice Guild, the South Gang Rice Guild, the Guang Gang Shen Shou Tang, the Han Gang Zhi Cheng Tang, the Zhenjiang Gang Ji Yuan Tang, and the Chaozhou Sugar and Sundries Guild. Chen Ziyi, Zhu Zixiang, Zhang Nianxuan, Qu Zhenhua, Fu Qiangeng, and twenty-one others were publicly elected as ex officio members. It was officially established on July 5th of this year under the guidance of the authorities of the two concessions. More than two months have passed, and eight evaluation committee meetings have been held. The highest price of foreign rice in the market was once evaluated at 60 yuan. However, to this day, the international situation has changed, and the source of foreign rice is not without difficulties. In addition, speculators are using excuses, and the market price of rice and grain is soaring. One call brings a hundred responses. The market price of foreign rice has actually exceeded 70 yuan. The evaluation is like a formality, and the announcement is like a mere statement. Ordinary people are suffering serious threats, and it seems inevitable that some will take risks. The committee feels that its heart is willing but its strength is insufficient, and has already sent letters to the authorities of the two concessions, appealing for instructions on the direction, so as to follow.</p>
<p>Concession Authorities Should Provide Instructions</p>
<p>Yesterday, a certain celebrity in this city told a New Voice News reporter that at a time when the people are panicking about food, the Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee should continue to exist. However, the need to increase the committee's strength cannot be delayed. Therefore, it is hoped that the authorities of the two concessions will provide practical guidance, and send additional members to participate in the deliberations, and order the committee's established policies to be implemented step by step, and provide strong assistance. Otherwise, the entire rice market in Shanghai will be unimaginable.</p>
<p>Zhang and Qu Resign, Unanimously Retained</p>
<p>The Shanghai Rice Store Industry Association has repeatedly insisted that the price limit for foreign rice should not be relaxed, and has also held meetings, with the industry collectively ordering foreign rice to avoid being affected by expensive imports and cheap exports. This is currently in active progress. Zhang Nianxuan and Qu Zhenhua, who participated in the Rice Evaluation Committee, submitted their resignations a few days ago. The Rice Evaluation Committee believes that Zhang and Qu have made many contributions, and has sent a letter to retain them.</p>
<p>The Court Strictly Deals with Profiteering Brokers</p>
<p>Because the price of rice in this city has repeatedly soared, the Public Works Department and rice industry groups jointly established a price limit. However, the general rice merchants only know how to fill their own pockets, ignoring the interests of the public. Although the price limit has been set, they are disobeying in secret. The actual market price is much higher than the price limit. The Public Works Department has prosecuted and dealt with those who violated the order in accordance with the law, and only then did they slightly suppress their arrogance. However, as time passes, they become playful, and such incidents have occurred again. The political department of the Public Works Department sent a monitor, Hua Detective Mao Guoshi, stationed at the rice market. On the morning of the previous day at 10:30, he discovered that a rice broker, Sun Quanguan from Qingpu, was selling a package of No. 2 Saigon rice samples, claiming to have 50 bags of rice. The selling price was 65 yuan per stone. The detective pointed out that the limit stipulated that the maximum price for this type of rice was 59 yuan per stone. Now Sun's selling price actually exceeded the price limit by 6 yuan. He was arrested. Sun wanted to bribe the detective with 40 yuan in legal currency. The detective took him to the Lao Zha Police Station. Yesterday morning, the police station lawyer Fang Fushu sent him to the Special First Court, and Judge Fang, etc., severely punished him in accordance with Article 122 of the Criminal Law and Article 33 of the Violation of Police Regulations and Penalties, in order to warn others.</p>
<h3>Recent Situation in Xinghua After Japanese Airstrikes</h3>
<p>According to those who came to Shanghai from Xinghua, at 7:55 a.m. on September 9th, six Japanese planes flew from the southwest to Xinghua, circled for a week, dropped more than 20 bombs, and patrolled and strafed with machine guns. In less than half an hour, they flew south. The losses in the city included two or three houses being bombed in Gengqiang West. One person died and one person was injured. Outside the city, in the area of the shipyard in Daijiawan, Cangxiang, Sanqingguan, North and South of Shiqiao, and the Daxiao Jiaochang, 20 to 30 houses were destroyed, and dozens of people were killed or injured. The injured civilians were immediately protected by military and police agencies and sent to the county hospital for treatment. It is reported that the order in Xinghua City has been restored. This unprovoked bombing by Japanese planes caused many civilian casualties, which is truly tragic.</p>
<h3>Mid-Autumn Festival Settlement Tomorrow, All Industries Pass Safely</h3>
<p>All Industry Markets Closed for One Day</p>
<p>September 16th (the 15th day of the eighth lunar month) is the Mid-Autumn Festival. All industries have rushed to settle accounts and have sent people to collect outstanding debts. For those in other ports, they have asked the industry associations for proof and sent people to collect them. This year, due to the blockade of the coastal areas of Zhejiang and Fujian and Vietnam, the cargo transportation of all routes has been stopped, and the actual sales are zero. The prices of goods have fallen, and the entire economy is extremely depressed. Fortunately, all factories, merchants, firms, and companies have tried their best to find ways to survive. The Mid-Autumn Festival settlement this year can generally be barely passed. Today is Sunday, a regular holiday. Tomorrow, the silver and money industry will be closed for one day. Therefore, all industries have completed the collection and settlement of the Mid-Autumn Festival yesterday, Saturday. As for the markets of various industries, such as gold, securities, foreign exchange, cotton, soybeans, grains, etc., they are all closed as usual during the Mid-Autumn Festival.</p>

<p>Banknotes Flying All Over the Street, Robbers Fled in Panic</p>
<p>At about 10:00 a.m. yesterday, at the intersection of Ningbo Road and Sichuan Road, there was a person who was about 20 years old, wearing short clothes, and looked like an old quartermaster of a business firm.

Unexpectedly, as he approached the place, a robber suddenly ambushed on the side of the road. Seeing the person carrying the money, he immediately stepped forward to rob him. Seeing that there was only one robber, and that he was unarmed, the person insisted on not letting go of the shoebox and shouted "Robber!" The two sides fought with each other. The hemp rope on the shoebox broke, causing the banknotes in the box to scatter all over the street. Passersby stopped to watch.

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>Dear Editor, The news report "Only Son Run Over and Killed by Car" in the September 13th Shen Bao newspaper does not conform to the facts. It is found that Zhu Yunsheng's seven-year-old only son, Caixing, was knocked down and killed by a French Public Bus No. 21, No. 824, on Poplar Road and Baylor Road, entirely due to the fault of driver Ma Canwen, No. 96. The deceased was three feet away from the station when the bus started, and he did not press the horn, which can be verified. The statement that the death was due to the deceased's own carelessness and that the driver was not at fault is clearly intended to evade responsibility. Please make a correction on behalf of the public. Corresponding to the letter, I hope you will check and correct it. Sincerely, Cheng Zhengping, Lawyer, September 14th, to Shen Bao Newspaper.</p>

<h3>The Secret Mark of the China Farmers Bank Two Corner Ticket</h3>
<p>The style of the two-corner ticket recently issued by the China Farmers Bank has been seen in this newspaper before. Now, the secret mark of the ticket is written as follows:</p>
<p>On the upper right corner of the front, between the tops of the two trees, there is the character "大" 1. Next to the tree on the left, near the "贰角" border, there is the English letter "T". A few points below that, there are the two letters "LE".</p>
<p>The above secret marks are quite difficult to detect, and are even smaller than the secret marks of the five-cent auxiliary coin. I am sure there are omissions, and I still need the guidance of experts. (Ji He)</p>
<h3>Gold Market Still Stable: Market Reopens on the 19th After the Holiday</h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot gold market saw secret dealings and further declines. Observing the recent volatility of the gold market, there exists extremely intense speculation. Most small-scale operators already harbor wariness, while those who usually stir up trouble now reach their point of interest. As for the reasons for today's decline, aside from the initial signs of firmness in the exchange rate market, everything stemmed from changes in public sentiment. Even if there was a desire to rise, it was suppressed by powerful short sellers. Ultimately, because there were too many floating individual investors, their resolve wavered, and many were forced to sell. The lowest price dropped from an opening of $6,100 to $6,085. Fortunately, there was a slight surge in buying before the close, raising it to $6,145. As a result, it closed $25 lower than the previous day. There was no market on Saturday afternoon, and the off-market trend slightly weakened. Trading was still brisk in the morning, with approximately 2,500 taels traded. Gold jewelry prices remained unchanged. Customs gold remained steady. Since next Monday is the Mid-Autumn Festival holiday, and Wednesday is the (September 18th) Incident anniversary, Tuesday will also be closed, resulting in a total of four days of closure. The market will resume as usual on Thursday.</p>
<p>Spot Gold Drops $25</p>
<p>Since the initial opening, the exchange rate market was reported as weak, and the market sentiment was extremely sluggish. Silver houses scrambled to undercut prices and aggressively sold, resulting in a sharp $70 drop. First, a gold firm offered 20 taels to a silver house at $6,100. Subsequently, as sellers continued to emerge, a certain silver house with long positions unloaded, further pushing the price down by more than $10 to a low of $6,085. Fortunately, money exchange businesses and individual investors had good appetites, and there was overnight short covering, so the price gradually stabilized. It did not rise back to $6,135. However, a certain silver house then resumed aggressive selling, with a quantity of approximately 10 taels or more. Although securities firms seized the opportunity to absorb, it was ultimately pushed down again to $6,105. At noon, with the activity of Hong Kong firms, it immediately rose by more than $10. In addition, as the exchange rate market soon softened, buying interest surged. A certain silver house reversed its actions from selling to buying, and money exchange businesses with long positions took the opportunity to raise prices. As a result, the market ultimately closed at the day's high of $6,145, still $25 lower than the previous day. With fluctuations of $60 in half a day, the off-market trend was soft, at $6,125, where some transactions occurred. The selling price of spot gold from cash shops was more than $10 higher than the spot price, while the buying price was $30 lower. The current margin gold price was more than $50 lower than the listed gold price. There were very few new transactions.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Returns Slightly</p>
<p>The exchange price of gold jewelry in silver shops was once quoted $10 higher at 9:50 am, suspended at $620, but by noon it returned $10 higher, ultimately remaining at the original price of $630. The price was the same for new colleagues and the buying price was approximately $30 lower.</p>
<h3>British Bills Have No Advisors, Price Drops Another 50 Cents, US Bills Still Hovering</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign currency market suddenly softened again. British and American gold pounds each fell by $1 as a result. British gold bills still have no advisors, and the market price fell another 50 cents. American gold bills still did not escape the hovering trend, ultimately continuing to fall by 7 cents. Hong Kong bills frequently declined, retreating to $4.21 in the evening market. Japanese gold bills felt increasingly unsupported, retreating to $1.49 in the evening market. Korean bills had supply exceeding demand, and the market price weakened, retreating to $1.10 in the evening market.</p>
<h3>Food: Rice Prices Near the Holiday Slightly Weaken</h3>
<p>After the current silver dollar rice market turned to hovering from the previous trend, yesterday it ultimately became a situation of first stable and then weak. It was said that sellers in the morning still considered maintaining their position without changes. If No. 2 Saigon required $65, No. 2 Siam and Little Twisted $62.50. However, as the Mid-Autumn Festival approached, most speculators and actual sales customers had to engage in closing out positions, resulting in a decline in transactions. Furthermore, the cash situation was not only lacking fresh funds, but also sought to quickly exit, resulting in an imbalance between supply and demand, with most seeking to exit. Moreover, it was reported that rice merchants had a telegram stating that 2,000 tons were being shipped from Burma and Siam, which seemed to suggest a possible overall arrangement in the current market. Therefore, public sentiment and market prices uniformly plummeted by more than $1. As a result, it was slightly less than half a dollar lower than the previous day. Keh Hsien and Keh Yuan continued to arrive from the Yangtze River area, and more could continuously arrive in the future. Therefore, the selling price also saw a slight return of 50 to 70 or 80 cents, it was said. No. 1 Saigon was only $68.50, Quick Twisted $67.50, $67, No. 2 Saigon $64.20, No. 2 Siam $62, Little Twisted $63, $62.60, Tokyo Sharp Tip $58.50, $58, Haiphong Red Tip $58.80, $57, Rice Leuh $54, $53.50.</p>
<p>Although glutinous rice had no arrivals, the outgoing route was tight, and the market price could not be sustained, falling by 50 cents to $1. Open Gold Lieh Teh Yuan $71.2, Chang Dan White Yuan $70.05 to $69, Hong Kong Teh Yuan $71.5, $71, Ordinary $70.05 to $69.</p>
<p>The sources of thick and thin broken keng rice and other national rice, since they were near the holiday, had no arrivals. Off-market secret dealings were rumored to be stable because of this, without success or failure. Party Gang Teh Keng $80, Ordinary $78-79, Wu Chang Su Kun Keng High $78-79, Next to $76-77, Qing Jiao Thin Broken $77, South Port Original Package Early Broken $76.5, $76, Jie Jian $74, $73.5.</p>
<p>Yesterday's new keng tip arrivals included 32 stones of Zhoupu new keng, 34 stones of Taicang Jiading Yang tip, and 16 stones of Jiaoli Du tip. Because they were timely delicacies, their sales were especially good, so their selling prices stood out exceptionally, presenting a firm situation. It is calculated that new keng $72-73, Taicang Jiading, Yang Tip were both $66.5, $66, Du Tip $67.5, $67, (Advertisement) Today is a weekly holiday, tomorrow is the Mid-Autumn Festival, and all rice market businesses will be closed for two days for closing accounts, and will resume normal business on the 17th.</p>
<h3>Japanese Flour Speculation: Actually Exits the Pass at $16; There is Talk of Increasing Prices at Chinese Factories</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the No. 2 flour factory price remained at the original price of $15.50. Spot flour was quite tight. With the Mid-Autumn Festival closing the border, the street's needs were very good. Because the production of each factory was limited, they were unable to fully supply. The market was exceptionally brisk in secret. There were rumors that the factory price would increase after the holiday, which attracted general attention. Because the Japanese factory's futures flour had already risen to over $16, which was higher than the factory price. But in fact, it was all being aggressively raised by speculators and did not belong to the normal track. It was all speculators stirring up trouble. Because Phoenix brand futures flour had become a speculative chip, the market was being pursued by both long and short parties. The volume of transactions for October reached as many as 80,000 bags. The volume of transactions for September was also 10,000 bags. The opening price for September was from $15.45 to $15.50, which was 17 cents higher than the previous day. The opening price for October was $15.80, rising to $16.08, which was 28 cents higher than the previous day. Yuh Weng Yuan Cannon Passenger prices still required $17. Chinese factories were still unwilling to sell. Foreign flour was $17.40 to $17.50 and still needed to be tightly called, but no formal transactions were heard.</p>
<h3>New Chongming Wheat Arrives: Price Opens at $25</h3>
<p>In recent days, the wheat market situation has been such that, because the issuance of transport permits has been difficult, goods arriving from the mainland have been scarce. Chinese factories have had difficulty buying, and Japanese factories have suppressed prices to buy. The difference in prices has often been more than $3. Therefore, most cargo owners have wanted to defend and wait for opportunities, unwilling to sell painfully. Apart from sending to factories for pricing, there has been no formal market. However, it was heard that yesterday nearly 1,000 packages of new Chongming wheat suddenly arrived, which were quite welcomed by the mainland gang. The mainland gang reportedly took away a load at a price of $25. The Japanese factory also took away 500 packages at a price of only $21. The market situation followed the flour market and became tight.</p>
<h3>Securities: Domestic Debt Remains Firm</h3>
<p>Securities trading was only conducted for half a day yesterday. Because today is Sunday and tomorrow is a two-day holiday for the Mid-Autumn Festival, market sentiment was relatively stable. Market prices saw both rises and falls. On one hand, floating long positions were slightly unloaded due to economic reasons. On the other hand, with ample funds, they seized the opportunity to absorb. Market prices therefore rose and fell erratically, but the trend remained very strong. There were more changes during the two-day holiday, and public sentiment was slightly uncertain. Yesterday morning's half-day trading saw quite enthusiastic buying of Lian Yi Heng Fu and scattered purchases. Shun Chang Tong Kang and Hu He Ji saw some selling, with different choices made. Market prices therefore saw both high and low prices. As a result, rises outnumbered falls, but by a very small amount. The volume of transactions was approximately $7.1 million. A brief table is listed below.</p>
<p>Category Highest Lowest Closing Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>Stock Trading, 500 shares of Chinese Business Electric Shares were traded at a price of $5.90.</p>
<p>London, September 13th (Friday) Telegram, Today's listings for Chinese foreign debt and Far Eastern British company stocks were all calm. Market conditions generally remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Ample Yarn and Flower Chips: Yarn Prices Want to Rise but are Hindered</h3>
<p>The yarn market was ordinary. The range of ups and downs became increasingly narrow, with high and low prices only around $10. In fact, current sales were smooth, but the environment was poor. In addition, inventory gradually increased. Therefore, although long-term intentions were strong, there were enough chips to distribute, and there was nothing that could be done. However, some were still considering buying, because the exchange rate was still expected to shrink. However, in terms of itself, the ability to rise was particularly weak. Therefore, some made a profit when October was rising, and the price reached $988.</p>
<p>The morning opening of spot yarn saw relatively mild sentiment. Because there were no major changes in various materials. However, most people were optimistic. 20-count Double Horse was uniformly quoted at $985. The opening price was $983. It was then heard that the opening of exchange bills was long, and gold greatly declined. Selling was slightly stronger, falling to $975. It hovered at this price for a long time. Finally, the market said that starting Monday, there would be a three-day closure for the Mid-Autumn Festival and the September 18th Incident. Normal business would resume on the 19th. In order to avoid risks, most closed out their positions for the holiday. Therefore, the market situation went from soft to firm, returning to $979 at the close. The statistics for transactions in half a day totaled 2,155 bales. The market for 20-count Double Horse did not have much difference from the previous price. The amounts bought by the various groups are listed separately below.</p>
<p>Ningbo 25 Mainland 20 Colleagues 1,790 Hong Kong 280 Jiangxi 30 Wenzhou 20 Total 2,155</p>
<h3>Cotton Market: Let's See After the Holiday</h3>
<p>The current cotton situation still lacks exciting developments to describe. Factory appetites are particularly dull. This is because the yarn market cannot prosper. Therefore, public sentiment is mediocre. As for new cotton, although the harvest year is prosperous, it is futile if it cannot be transported out of the country. A total of 10 bales of fire machines were priced at $154, it was said.</p>
<p>Another message: Foreign cotton market prices, New York cotton market, market conditions were firm, because there was a lack of sellers. Later, there was some reactionary buying. As a result, the closing situation was exceptionally stable, rising one pound. The Indian market situation was also particularly calm, along with a prediction of rising half a rupee.</p>
<p>Shanghai's foreign cotton trading was silent all day long. Because yarn prices failed to rally, all parties temporarily had no thought of transacting and planned to quietly pass the Mid-Autumn Festival before making further calculations. The factory's intention to purchase has also been very weak recently.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Edible Oil Sees Another Monopoly, Cargo Owners Sell Upwards, Prices Rise Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the oil market saw another surge, resulting from continuous movement in sales venues and the high-spirited desires of general speculation, leading to intense monopolistic tactics. Cargo owners' intention to sell was also firm, single-mindedly holding onto good prices. Therefore, market conditions repeatedly rose. The total market saw 20 barrels of Dalian soybean oil open, see the market price column, 30 barrels of Qingdao soybean oil, 50 pieces of Jiaozhou soybean oil, 350 dan of Da You Yu Factory soybean oil, 30 barrels of Pudong Factory soybean oil, 120 pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil, 350 pieces were ordered for late September delivery at a price of $64.50 to $65.75, 150 pieces were ordered for early October delivery at a price of $65.50 to $66.50, 750 pieces were ordered for late October delivery at a price of $66, 130 pieces of Yantai raw oil at a price of $65, 130 barrels of Qingdao raw oil at a price of $91.50 to $92.50, 50 barrels were ordered for late October delivery at a price of $93, also 1,000 tins in cans at a price of $92.50. According to the announcement from the miscellaneous grain oilcake market, the 16th and 18th of this month will be closed as usual.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Edible Sugar Transport and Sale to the Mainland is Obstructed</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was said to be because the transport permits for transporting to the mainland were controlled by a certain party and not issued, making it difficult to transport and sell temporarily. Although there were only slightly more than 1,000 bags of imported sugar in Shanghai, the above-mentioned relationship made it difficult to improve temporarily. The association's planned price drop saw a return to looseness. Spot 24 Crude White, the store still had $78, new goods from foreign stores $78, Small Hexagon, Transit goods $62.80, Unchanged, Dutch Cotton White KD Mark, $73.7, Small Triangle, Dutch Red Small $1, Mark $62, Miscellaneous Mark $61, Taikoo Car White also Small $1 to several corners, B Mark $75.5, DY Mark $72.9, HX Mark $72.7 to 5, National sugar has also not been opened.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Cloth Sales Uniquely Strong in South China</h3>
<p>National Cloth Yesterday's market was dark and dull. There were few transactions from stocking households. Customer sales were uniquely strong in South China. However, wholesale shipments were not smooth. The loading of goods in the Soviet-Chekiang guerrilla area was still subject to strict restrictions. The Shanghai market inventory greatly increased. Cloth factories also had a general trend of reducing work. Yesterday's cloth prices were flat. A portion of each piece fell by 10 to 25 cents. Factory direct sales still had secret dealings. Guangdong-Hong Kong agents had several hundred pieces of colored cloth and colored twill. Zhejiang-Fujian agents had more than two hundred pieces of coarse cloth and colored twill. Colleagues on the street transacted in more than six hundred pieces of grey cloth, velvet cloth, coarse cloth, and printed cloth. Agents in foreign Siam and Singapore had several thousand pieces of bleached cloth.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth The market atmosphere was flat and tired, and transactions were very light. Twelve-pound Dragon Head fine cloth opened in the morning at $32.35, rising to $32.65, but ultimately, due to sluggish actual sales, it returned to a decline. The closing price of the after-market was around $32.5. Four Gentlemen Serge was 91.5 cents per yard.</p>
<p>Exports Yesterday, there were 170 pieces of piece goods transported to Siam, and another 100 pieces transported to Yantai.</p>
<h3>Lined Overcoat Fabric: Many Goods, Low Prices</h3>
<p>Lined overcoat fabrics, riding breeches, camelskins, and cashmere are the two most popular types. Currently, with the Mid-Autumn Festival approaching and the weather turning cooler, actual sales are timely. Most shops specializing in lined overcoats are actively stocking up, resulting in quite smooth market sales recently. But observing the selling prices, various brands have seen price declines, because in the previous month, when sales were not strong, the atmosphere was tense. There had been early buying and selling. Each store had considerable inventory, and because there were eager orders from factories, spot goods were woven and filled. In addition, Yih Ho Factory first reported price declines for various goods, which caused many goods to follow cheaper, resulting in an oversupply and a decline in market conditions. Yesterday, Zhang Hua riding breeches were quoted at $23-24, Yih Ho $25-26, Saigon 1005 old brand at $38. Camelskin selling prices were $1.5 higher than riding breeches. Yongxing goods were only sold at $22 per yard.</p>
<h3>Financial Review and Commentary</h3>
<p>— Sheng Kaiqiong</p>
<p>— September 14th —</p>
<p>The True Meaning of Frugality and National Salvation Savings</p>
<p>The National Frugality and National Salvation Savings Movement Committee and the National Frugality and Diligence Committee jointly initiated the "Frugality and National Salvation Savings Corps," which held its inaugural meeting in Chongqing on the 6th. The Supreme Commander of China was appointed as the Honorary Leader, and Vice President Kong, concurrently Minister of Finance, served as the General Leader. To actively promote the movement for quick results, General Leader Kong telegraphed all provincial governors and mayors on the 9th, requesting that savings corps be established by September 15th. During the period from September 18th to Double Ten Day, actively launch the Frugality and National Salvation Savings Movement, with a mandatory goal of each citizen saving a minimum of one to five yuan per month.</p>
<p>The promotion of frugality and savings in China is based on the first principle of the wartime economic construction's three principles: "To engage in the accumulation of capital for production and the revitalization of industry with extreme frugality and diligence." Therefore, on November 29, 1938, the National Government promulgated the eleven articles of the Regulations on Frugality and National Salvation Savings. On September 12, 1939, the Ministry of Finance announced the twelve articles of the Regulations on Frugality and National Salvation Savings Bonds. In the same year, on December 14, the Ministry of Finance also announced the eight chapters, totaling twenty-one articles, of the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Regulations on Frugality and National Salvation Savings Bonds. The issuing agencies, subscription methods, and fund utilization of savings bonds are all detailed in the aforementioned three regulations. This article briefly discusses its origin and two points regarding the economic impact of the war.</p>
<p>Savings bonds originated in Britain. During the First European War, they became wartime savings bonds, which were the best way to promote small savings. At that time, they were very effective in Britain, absorbing an amount of 300 to 400 million pounds, which was extremely effective in strengthening the wartime economy and stabilizing the post-war economy. After the outbreak of this European war, the government immediately issued savings bonds, and the total amount reached more than 100 million pounds within thirteen weeks. Therefore, the Chinese government also followed suit after one year of the War of Resistance.</p>
<p>As for the key to the war economy, its utilization and the theories of current economists are very different. Generally, it is believed that the government's financial needs increase during wartime, and the amount of funds in society also increases. Therefore, savings are used to absorb idle funds in society, reduce the amount of currency in circulation, and use savings funds in the form of public bonds. According to this method, such cycles are repeated to increase financial resources and regulate currency. However, if this method is used to strengthen the war economy and stabilize the post-war economy, there is a significant phenomenon: all the funds in society become national public debt, which is a kind of consumer wealth, not a kind of accumulated productive capital. Therefore, the current use of savings bond funds should absolutely avoid the above-mentioned method, and regard investment in economic construction as the guideline for fund utilization. Increased revenue from state-owned enterprises and increased tax revenue should be sought in the development of wealth and the revitalization of industry. The goal of seeking increased financial resources is the same, and the method of using savings to absorb funds and regulate currency is also the same, but the technology adopted to achieve increased financial resources is completely different.</p>
<p>In short, the promotion of frugality and national salvation savings is indeed a financial measure that makes extremely valuable contributions to China's finance during this era of resistance and national construction. On the individual level, it can cultivate a national spirit of frugality, eliminate waste, and prepare for improvements in personal and family life. On the national level, it can accumulate construction funds, transform consumer wealth into productive wealth, and enable the rapid completion of national economic construction, thereby strengthening the power of the war economy. Since the beginning of China's War of Resistance, the author has deeply felt that the mobilization of material and financial resources has not yet reached the goal of matching and adapting to military and political needs, and the construction of the wartime economy requires the joint efforts of every Chinese citizen.

<p>Review of Men's Health Issues After Marriage</p>
<p>…What life seeks, no illness is a god!</p>
<p>…Physical weakness after marriage is the most tragic of sufferings!</p>
<p>Because many classmates, friends, and relatives, neighbors, they were young, we once played together, their bodies felt good, but after marriage, in a short time, most have been declining state, not specific ambition depressed, no longer have the aggressive past, and several people even died from illness. Old friends wither, it really makes me sad! Because I am studying medicine, which further aroused my motivation to review the health problems of men after marriage.</p>
<p>Does married life have any impact on health? The answer to this question can be described as "different opinions." But summing up, it is nothing more than two sides, positive and negative. Some people say that marriage is detrimental to health. If a man does not marry and always maintains his virginity, he can enjoy longevity. However, those who refute him say: In fact, only see the life of late-married men is shorter than that of married men. Although single monks may enjoy longevity, but in fact can an adult man not marry? Therefore, some people say that marriage is helpful to health, because the sexes are the natural instinct, innate and timely to show its effect. If this effect is too suppressed, physiological barriers will occur. The most common phenomenon in late-married men often has Hysteria, neurasthenia and other symptoms, according to medical scientist (Jamsu) James Tuo said: "A man over the age of twenty-eight and not married, more or less always a bit of mental illness." At first we didn't believe it, but after careful observation of the facts, we knew it was true. We know more in biological studies that some animals die because they cannot find a mate. So marriage is indeed a necessary event that we cannot avoid in life. As long as the man is pure-hearted and abstemious before marriage, and keeps his virginity, and can keep the way of hygiene in married life after marriage, then the love between husband and wife can last forever, spend their sweet life forever, give birth to smart children, and organize a happy family. In this way, not only can they improve their health, but also enrich the happiness of their lives. It is truly the so-called "more blessings, more longevity, more sons." But if a young man commits self-masturbation or post-marital debauchery, he will definitely explode spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, impotence, energy dissipation, neurasthenia and other symptoms. In this way, not only will he be sick and short-lived, shortening their natural life, but also must be unable to coordinate in married life, and will be hated by his wife, and stage various tragedies in the family! When it comes to this point, the problem is even more serious and complex. The only remedy, according to world-famous doctors and my experience, is to take the gonadotropin preparation "Reproductive Element", which is most effective for the symptoms. Because this agent is replicated by scientific methods from the gonadotropin extracted from the majestic animal body, so the quality is pure, the medicinal properties are royal, and the tonic power is active, which is really unmatched by other glandular preparations. After taking it, it can produce sperm and tonify the kidney, strengthen the brain and activate blood circulation, and nourish nerves in one day and night. If it can be taken continuously and consistently, it will definitely be able to completely cure the above symptoms in a short period of time. However, those with spermatorrhea must also take "Ximituo's Sperm-Consolidating Tablets" to consolidate the sperm pass and stop leakage, then the effect will be faster!</p>
<p>Fitness and Beauty</p>
<h3>The Value of Breasts in Female Fitness and Beauty</h3>
<p>— American Medical Doctor Yao Chongpei</p>
<p>Not to say a word to increase the ambition of others and destroy their own prestige, Western women are indeed much more healthy and beautiful than our Chinese women. Not only do they have straight chests and high breasts in their girlhood, but also large hips. Walking on the road, they have a magnificent, arrogant, and arrogant spirit. Even a few old women, although their hair is white, their pair of breasts are still so high, and have not萎　withered. Therefore, the children they give birth to are also particularly intelligent and agile, and the physique of the nation is also particularly strong.</p>
<p>According to the research results of world-renowned beauty experts, physiologists, and gynecological experts, Kantlin and Tang Posheng, etc., it is believed that the higher and more elastic the breasts of women are, not only in terms of beauty, can they form the most mysterious curve with the hips and waist. Make every man look at it and have a good feeling. At the same time, due to the soundness of their own ovarian function, the exuberance of metabolism, their temperament is uninhibited and gentle, their muscles are crystal clear and white, and they think more　sensitively and thoroughly. Even when faced with difficult problems, they can deal with them analytically and will not feel difficult to cope with. In addition, due to the full circulation of blood, a peach blossom-like smile appears on their faces. Even if they do not apply makeup, they are also very beautiful. Although age increases, youth remains. Sexual life is infinitely sweet, and they organize healthy and lively children. Such women, their contribution to the country and the family is really great! However, in the past, if the breasts withered　and the hips were thin due to chest binding, self-abuse, irregular menstruation, and leucorrhea, they not only have been sick in their girlhood, with no beautiful and moving posture at all. And once they get married, they also increase the hatred of their husbands due to lack of sexual interest and the above-mentioned defects, and even abandon them! The only remedy is to take the ovarian preparation for women "Reproductive Element" to nourish menstruation, so that the ovarian function is sound, and the metabolism is also vigorous. The above symptoms can not only be completely cured, but also make the breasts high and the cheeks rosy, and increase health and beauty.</p>
<h3>Nocturnal Emission and Self-abuse are the Demons of Youth</h3>
<p>— Sexually Transmitted Disease Specialist Zhan Nianhui</p>
<p>This may be the abnormal pathology of society! During this extraordinary period of saving the country, the lights are still red and the wine is green on this isolated island, filled with erotic and lewd nets. A general young people just in the development, in this rich and seductive environment, not to mention his heart is also looking forward to all the secrets between the sexes, ready to try to see what a result, but they on the one hand because of the economic and venereal disease terrible, afraid to openly go to prostitution, but on the one hand can not get rid of the fascination of peach, so had to ask the next best thing, then began to commit self-abuse,</p>
<p>After a young man commits self-abuse, even if his thoughts are rich, his memory is strong, and his physical strength is solid, he will unknowingly degenerate at this time. If he suffers from spermatorrhea and sperm leakage due to self-indulgence, at this time, not only will your developmental function stagnate and become incomplete, with a yellow face and thin muscles, and premature aging, it is really the so-called "little old man"! This kind of "little old man's" learning and career are because of the lack of brainpower and physical strength, which makes him accomplish nothing. And because of kidney deficiency and incompetence, and the reason for the dissipation of energy, but also to destroy the happiness in his future married life! However, how can his wife waste her youth for a long time? Therefore, the staging of various tragedies in the family is also a common thing!</p>
<p>Regarding the treatment of nocturnal emission, although there are many advertisements on the market today, but the most effective, according to world-famous doctors and my many years of experience, is to take "Ximituo's Sperm-Consolidating Tablets", because this agent can not only consolidate the sperm pass, but also calm the nerves, so that young people with neurasthenia, to get sleep, so the dreams are reduced, the heart is disturbed all gone, nocturnal emission can be cured, but because the nocturnal emission has caused the above-mentioned symptoms, should also take the gonadotropin preparation "Reproductive Element", to nourish the brain and kidney, increase sperm and blood, and nourish the nerves, if you can continue to take, will be able to fully restore health in the short term.</p>
<h3>Treatise on Treating Turbidity</h3>

<p>New and Old Leukorrhea Can Be Cured in a Short Period</p>
<p>If You Don't Believe, Come for a Consultation, the Fact Will Be Solid Proof!</p>
<p>After seeing this title, patients with shallow knowledge who have never seen the latest scientific weapons may have many doubts, thinking that this doctor is boasting. But in the eyes of those who have been baptized by the latest science or who have been treated by me, they naturally feel that my title is not an exaggeration at all. Because the world now is not the 19th century, look: everything, no matter what you eat, use, or walk on, is progressing with the times. So, can't the leukorrhea that people in the 19th century thought was difficult to treat completely be controlled? The so-called "it depends on the person," the focus is that you can't concentrate on research, that's true. As for my methods and medical equipment for treating new and old leukorrhea, I can frankly tell you some here: Because treating leukorrhea has been my full-time job for seventeen years. I usually don't rely on false names to live in comfort. I still do everything myself and study diligently, never relying on assistant doctors. I am even more meticulous and cautious in prescribing medicine and performing surgery, and I am loyal and honest. As for therapeutic equipment, as long as it is truly effective, I will find a way to purchase it, no matter how expensive it is. Roughly speaking, there are ureteroscopes, cystoscopes, ultra-magnifying microscopes, short and long wave diathermy machines, coolers, etc. The most helpful for me in treating turbidity is the German Lulin flat-flow diathermy machine. The bactericidal power of this machine can be said to be unparalleled in the world, so no matter whether it is new or old leukorrhea, once treated with this machine, supplemented by other operations and medicines, it is really foolproof. I guarantee that it can be completely cured in two weeks for the quick ones and five weeks for the slow ones. Curing is not strange, what is strange is that it will never recur.</p>

<h3>Bertrand Russell's Theory of Academic Freedom</h3>
<p>British mathematician and philosopher Dr. Bertrand Russell recently served as a lecturer at the University of California in the United States. In May of this year, the New York Supreme Court ruled that Russell was not allowed to teach mathematics, philosophy, and science at the City University of New York because he advocated free love. This case caused a great uproar in American education circles for a time, and the details of the case have been translated and published in this newspaper. This article is Professor Russell's reply, originally published in Harper's Magazine, and is now translated as follows:</p>
<p>In the past hundred years, the profession of teaching has changed from instructing a few people in the pursuit of academic excellence to a public service related to the majority of people. From ancient times to the present, this profession has had a glorious and great history; but modern teachers, if inspired by the ideals of their predecessors, will deeply feel that teaching people with their ideals is not their task, and that their task is precisely to instill the beliefs and prejudices that their employers consider useful. In the past, a teacher had to possess great wisdom, and his every word and deed were respected. In ancient times, teaching was not an organized profession, and no one interfered with their teaching. Of course, there were also those who were punished for their heretical doctrines. Socrates was sentenced to death, and Plato was imprisoned, but such accidents did not hinder the spread of their doctrines. Anyone who has a pure and subtle feeling for teachers wants to pass on his books, not his body, to future generations, to be immortal. Intellectually unique insights are the main conditions for completing the teacher's task, and it is his duty to create public opinion with knowledge and reason as much as possible. In ancient times, teachers could perform this task without interference, except for occasional ineffective interventions by tyrants or rioters. In the Middle Ages, teaching became the privilege of the Church, and as a result, there was little progress in knowledge or society. By the time of the Renaissance, society universally respected learning and restored greater freedom to teachers. Throughout history, most universities and other institutions of learning have been in the hands of dogmatists, and as a result, most of the excellent literary works have been written by scholars who are not related to educational institutions. Especially in England, until the nineteenth century, except for Newton, very few first-class scholars were related to universities. But the social system at that time rarely interfered with their work.</p>
<p>In the more highly organized modern world, we have a new problem. So-called "education" is generally granted to individuals by the state, and sometimes by the church. Teachers therefore, in most cases, become public servants and must be responsible for educating children for those who are uneducated and for those who have no teaching experience. Their only purpose in running education is propaganda. In such circumstances, it is difficult for teachers to fulfill their most suitable responsibilities.</p>
<p>State education is obviously necessary, but it also obviously contains some dangers. The kind of malpractices we fear have been fully manifested in Germany and the Soviet Union. The youth of these two countries have become stubborn and ignorant of things outside their own country. Although this situation is extremely bad, if it can be as universal and international as the Catholicism of the Middle Ages, its harm may not be so great. But the entire theory of international culture is opposed by modern dictators, who have one kind of belief in Germany, another in Italy, one in the Soviet Union, and yet another in Japan. In these countries, each country pays special attention to educating young people, in the heat of nationalism, as a result, the people of one country have no common ground with the people of other countries, and there is no common awareness of civilization to eliminate mutual killing.</p>
<p>In democratic countries, these kinds of malpractices are not so serious, but there are still equally serious dangers in education. This danger can only be avoided by those who believe in freedom of thought, carefully preventing teachers from being restricted in their knowledge. I believe that teaching a certain indisputable knowledge is the least important item in a teacher's responsibility. Naturally, this is the basis for other knowledge, and it is of great use to our mechanical civilization. In modern society, there should be sufficient technical talents to preserve the machinery on which our material happiness depends. But it is also extremely inconvenient if a large part of the population cannot read or write. Therefore, I am very much in favor of implementing universal compulsory education. But governments know very well that in the process of education, it is easy to instill beliefs and opinions that are beneficial or unfavorable to the authorities in certain teaching materials with different viewpoints. The responsibility for the defense of civilized countries lies in the hands of teachers, no less than in the army. Apart from totalitarian countries, national defense is necessary, and there is nothing wrong with the education carried out for this purpose. What can be criticized is only that the country uses a system of illiteracy and appeals to unreasonable enthusiasm to defend itself.</p>
<p>This method is not necessary for any country worth defending. However, those who have no direct knowledge of education have a natural tendency to adopt this method. Many people believe that the uniformity of public opinion and the limitation of freedom can make the country stronger. Since 1700, although victory in every major war has mostly belonged to the more democratic countries, we have repeatedly heard opinions that democracy makes a country weak and incompetent in war. But judging from past facts, there have been more people who advocate narrow-minded ideological unity who have caused the demise of the country than those who advocate freedom of thought. Although the world's dogmatists also know this, they believe that if two different opinions are given the opportunity to express themselves freely, it is enough to lead people astray. This view is enough to cause two kinds of misfortune: either one faction of dogmatists conquers the world and prohibits all new ideas, or another faction of dogmatists conquers other regions and propagates hatred creeds to meet each other with arms, similar to the former's crime, which occurred in the Middle Ages, similar to the latter's crime, which was seen in the era of religious wars, and again in modern times. The former makes civilization stagnate, and the latter makes civilization face the danger of being completely destroyed. In order to prevent these two, teachers should fulfill the task of being the main defenders of civilization. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>The Great Fire of London in the Seventeenth Century</h3>
<p>— L</p>
<p>These days, the German air force has been bombing London continuously. The bombs dropped are measured in tons. Apart from the loss of life, civilian houses and official residences have been turned into ruins, and prosperous downtowns have become rubble fields. The two words "hellfire" can really summarize everything. From a historical point of view, this catastrophe of loss of life and property is indeed unprecedented. However, in terms of disaster, London also experienced the greatest fire in history 274 years ago, which burned continuously for three days and three nights, and the embers did not extinguish for seven days. Most of the essence of the entire city was turned into scorched earth, covering an area of 450 acres, with 200,000 people homeless, and a total loss of about 7,335,000 pounds. What is strange is that only eight people lost their lives. Moreover, misfortunes never come singly. In the year before this great fire, London also experienced a great plague. Between summer and autumn, the plague spread in the city, and deaths followed one after another. The citizens fled to the countryside to avoid the plague. The scenes of cars and horses connecting on the way were no less than today's air raid prevention and evacuation of residents in the city. That great plague, from June to December, in just six months, killed more than 68,500 people, which is not shocking to hear. Fortunately, the British used their unyielding spirit to deal with these extraordinary disasters, and finally built a brand-new "Greater London" from the ruined walls, broken walls, scorched wood, and ruins. The following record of the Great Fire is mostly based on the diaries of the naval minister at the time, Pepys, and the writer John Evelyn.</p>
<p>The London plague in 1665, from the winter of the previous year to the spring of this year, did not see a drop of rain, creating an unprecedented drought. After King Charles II of England returned to England, the Restoration had been going on for five years. Although the political facilities had been changed, the narrow streets of London and the crowded habits were still the same as before. Moreover, the city's drinking water supply was very unclean, and the water source was not smooth, which was mostly the reason for the spread of the plague. On June 10, the plague was first seen, and in less than half a month, it was everywhere. In addition to the shock, the residents had no choice but to escape. For a time, on the road to the countryside, men, women, old and young, carried boxes and cages, and cars and horses followed. Within ten days, the lively city became a dead city. Except for a few enthusiastic priests and doctors, all officials, merchants, and scholars all fled far away. In the streets, besides the sanitation team and the burial team, there was nothing else to see. Occasionally, someone walked on the street, also bowing their heads and walking quickly, without saying a word. Almost everyone had nothing to say to each other except "the great and praiseworthy God." The novelist Defoe, the author of Robinson Crusoe, wrote the book "A Journal of the Plague Year" to record the terrible scenes he witnessed at the time, which has been recited by the world. The great poet Milton avoided the plague in the countryside that year and completed his immortal masterpiece "Paradise Lost." The plague subsided slightly by the end of the year, but a wave had not subsided, and another wave rose again. In less than a year, London suffered the greatest fire in history.</p>
<p>The year 1666, which was called the "Year of Miracles", can be said to be the worst year. The British were using troops against the Dutch, and the treasury was being used like flowing water. On the one hand, London suffered unprecedented fire losses, and King Louis XIV of France also allied with the Dutch in that year and declared war on England. The fire broke out at 3:00 AM on Sunday, September 2. At first, the East City reported a fire alarm. After a while of disturbance, everyone thought it was nothing. A group of people who "watched the fire from the other side" went back to sleep when they saw no new developments. However, in the morning, the situation changed drastically. The fire spread in all directions, and many houses near London Bridge were also affected. At this time, the weather was dry and hot, and the east wind was blowing, as if in a fire pit. The houses near the Thames River soon caught fire. Many pigeons raised by people were flying around the windows and balconies, circling several times, with no branches to perch on, and were finally burned and fell to the ground and died.</p>
<p>In the midst of the strong wind and raging fire, no one could think of a way to put it out. Since the drought and plague, the buildings in London have been unusually dry, and once a fire starts, it spreads. Everyone stared blankly at the flames spreading everywhere, at a loss. The busy naval minister (i.e., Pepys, who recorded the Great Fire) entered the palace to inform the emperor and asked him to order that all the burning house walls be destroyed and dragged down, so that the flames would not spread. The King of England approved the request and asked him to cooperate with the Mayor of London to handle the matter. The naval minister met the Mayor of London on the street, only to see him as if drunk and dreaming, shouting in his mouth: "Oh my God, what should I do!" But he worried that in this panic and chaos, the common people would not obey his orders. Later, apart from demolishing houses, there was still no other way to do it.</p>
<p>Pepys drove a small boat on the Thames River to observe the fire. After a while, the King of England and the Duke of York also came upstream in flower boats. They ordered the shore to quickly push down the house walls to block the fire. However, the walls fell slowly and the flames spread quickly, and it was still of no avail. The Thames River was illuminated like daytime, and barges and small boats were everywhere, carrying the goods rescued from the fire. The residents' furniture and daily necessities were rarely rescued on board. There were only two small lyres in one boat, and he had nothing else. Because at that time, citizens loved this instrument very much, and in the panic, they did not take important things instead.</p>
<p>The weather in September was still very hot. In the evening, a red light set off the sunset, which was the color of rouge, making people feel even more hot and terrible. Fire stars and sparks were flying everywhere in the sky. From a burning house, several fireball-like things rose into the air, flew past five or six storefronts, and landed on another house that had not caught fire, and this house was immediately set on fire. In some dilapidated alleys, most of the houses had thatched roofs and wooden walls, and once they caught fire, they could not be salvaged. Moreover, many warehouses near the river bank were stocked with asphalt, tar, and oil and wine, and the fire spared nothing. That night, a huge smoke and fire, like a fire snake several feet thick, went straight to the church district, and famous buildings such as St. Paul's Cathedral suffered the disaster of the Great Fire.</p>
<p>Evelyn's diary is a valuable historical material for recording the Great Fire of London, and the description of the situation at that time is quite faithful. He watched the fire from the shore on Sunday afternoon; on Monday, he returned to the original place to see the fire in the southern half of the city. When the flames reached the church district, he was also there to watch. St. Paul's Cathedral was under renovation at this time, and wooden platforms for workers to work were set up around it, and the flames burned as soon as they arrived. At that time, there was a sound of explosions and crackling in the fire, and women and children screamed in panic; mixed with the sound of houses, spires, and chapels collapsing, it was like a tsunami of overturning mountains and seas. Because the fire was too strong, the air suffocated, and the temperature was so high that everyone had no way to walk into the fire, and could only stand in place and let it burn naturally. In an area two miles long and half a mile wide, the raging fire became a huge furnace. Smoke and nitric acid rose to the sky, extending to fifty miles away.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, September 4, the fire spread to Fleet Street, Old Bailey, Warwick Lane, etc. The bricks and stones of St. Paul's Cathedral flew around, as if throwing hand grenades. The metal, lead, and tin in the church building were melted by the fire and flowed on the ground like a river. The sidewalk flagstones in front of the door were burned red, and people and horses dared not trample on them. The ruined walls of the corners of the houses fell down from mid-air, and the charred wood and rubble completely blocked the road traffic. The court was also quite chaotic at this time. King Charles II of England and his brother took the lead and personally directed everything. Officials supervised the common people on every street, doing the work of knocking down walls and overturning houses.</p>
<p>On the 5th, the wind subsided slightly, and the large flames were not as rampant as in the previous two days. West of the law school and north of Smithfield, the flames did not reach and were fortunately preserved intact. This day was Wednesday, and after burning for three days and three nights, the fire gradually subsided. Pepys said: "Since Sunday, it has been very strange. It seems that the days are very long, because the sleep time has been very short for several days in a row, and I have seen all kinds of different scenes. It seems that more than a week has passed, and I have forgotten what day of the week it is."</p>
<p>While many people were watching the fire on the river bank and on the highlands south of the Thames River, the open space north of the river was filled with many homeless men, women, old and young. There were as many as 200,000 people displaced along the way from Islington to Highgate. There were all kinds of different classes and people. Everyone lay on the roadside, waiting to be fed, a picture of wailing, the scene was very sad, but they did not reach out to ask for help. The King of England, the nobles, and the church all voluntarily took out money to do relief work for the victims. All the poorest people received financial relief, but the relief work was very difficult, especially because food was difficult to obtain. All the usual sources were blocked. Later, the official office announced that farmers in the four villages should bring as much food to the city as possible. The official office also provided various conveniences for the victims who wanted to go to neighboring cities or villages. The country people, after hearing about the fire in the city, also came to "visit" from afar, regardless of the distance. During this fire, many books and documents were destroyed. Some books and papers rose high in the sky and even floated as far as Windsor. The black smoke rose, and it lasted for a long time. During the days of the Great Fire, it even covered the autumn sun, and it was dark and dull. People who came from afar mostly walked in the shadows.</p>
<p>The nobles seemed to be very cold to the King of England. According to Pepys, they did not come to the city to help the King of England or to express their condolences to him. The monument erected to commemorate the Great Fire has a Latin record that says that as a result of this fire, 89 churches, city gates, meeting halls, public places, hospitals, schools, libraries, and countless official buildings were destroyed. 13,200 civilian houses were destroyed in the fire, and 400 streets were destroyed. The government also suffered a lot of losses. In 1665 last year, because of the plague, people fled, and tax revenue was sharply reduced. This time, because of the fire, the people's financial resources were greatly weakened, and many people were impoverished. Where could they get money to pay taxes?</p>
<p>There was originally a line on the monument saying that the fire was caused by the rebellion and resentment of the Catholics. Later, the City Reconstruction Committee saw that this line was indecent and cancelled it. Who started the fire was not clear at the time. Many people were caught, interrogated, and investigated, but there was no clue. Later, a French silversmith suddenly came and claimed to be the arsonist. The authorities did not investigate deeply, believed it to be true, and hanged him. Many people said that this was a disgrace to the official office. Afterwards, the authorities cast a commemorative medal, in the middle was the eye of God, and below were two comets, one representing the plague and the other representing the fire. There were also images of people and horses and the dead. The words above read; "He punished."</p>
<p>After the Great Fire, the city of London soon prepared for reconstruction work. All buildings were replaced with bricks and tiles instead of wood, and streets and water sources were greatly reformed. St. Paul's Cathedral was also rebuilt by famous artists, and the city of London became brilliant and gradually became the world's largest city.</p>

<h3>Memorial Archways</h3>
<p>All loyal officials, righteous people, filial sons, filial daughters, virtuous women, and chaste women have the ceremonies of commendation, so as to value fame and integrity and maintain customs. For the commendation, if the matter is important and the traces are strange and difficult, then the archway is built by the government; if it is ordinary, then the archway is built by itself; however, there is no fixed place for building the archway, each is based on the gentry and people of the place, considering its suitability only, either in the open space outside the city, or in the streets inside the city. According to the Song and Ming dynasties, the most archways were built, and it is common to see those that stand across the streets, all titled "Song Officer" or "Ming Woman," and the newly built ones are rarely seen. Among them, many of the stones are dark in color, cracked and about to fall, and the houses below that lean on the foot of the archway are mostly small, and the cracked stones are getting worse day by day. If there is an accident, those who live below will all become powder. Yesterday, I heard that a memorial archway for chastity in Bianyi Street, Yangzhou, fell down, crushing one person to death, and his arm bones were all broken, which was unspeakable! This matter can serve as a warning. I have also seen that the most memorial archways for chastity are erected in the city of Shaoxing Prefecture. The number inside the city cannot be counted in detail; and the most proper ones are in the area outside Xikuo Gate. All those who build archways are gathered here, and the evening sun is chaotic, and the returning villagers all walk under the archways. Looking up at its forehead, most of them are old objects from the previous Ming dynasty in the city, while those outside Xikuo Gate were built at the beginning of this dynasty. It is said that the archways built before the Ming dynasty were good in the city, but in this dynasty, they knew that they would cause disaster to future generations, so they specially chose a vacant space outside the city.</p>

<h3>Children's Savings</h3>
<p>— Qiulang</p>
<p>Saving is a virtue. Saving is storing unnecessary funds for use when needed. Dear children, although you cannot earn money during your schooling and cannot have a large amount of money to buy savings certificates, your parents and elder brothers may give you a small amount of candy and snack money every day. Your parents and brothers bear the expensive tuition fees in this difficult era and provide you with clothing and food. They only hope that you will study hard and be diligent and endure hardship, and so on, to be a good and kind child. Children's savings is also something you should do. When you get pocket money, do not buy candy or snacks to eat at will, because eating these is not only not very beneficial, but also, as the old saying goes, "The more you eat, the more greedy you become." Don't think it's a small amount and despise it. You must know that small amounts add up to a lot. "Save one cent a day, and in three years you will have ten yuan extra." Therefore, I advise you to quickly save this extra money, accumulate it day by day, one to cultivate good habits of thrift, and two, saving is to prepare for unexpected needs. If you have an urgent need, you can take it out and use it, avoiding the trouble of raising funds temporarily. Third, when you grow up and serve the country and society, there will be more places where you need money, so children's savings is very important. I hope you will all implement it from today!</p>
<h3>An Opportunity for Renewal</h3>
<p>— Yang Chunlv</p>
<p>School has started! Children are back to living their lives at school!</p>
<p>Now, at the beginning of the school year, it’s a perfect opportunity for children to renew themselves. Whether they've moved up a grade, stayed in the same one, or even been held back, they should all examine themselves: Did they miss any classes in the past semester? What were the reasons for missing classes? How were their academic results? Which subjects are they not as good at as others? Do they have any physical defects? Have they had any illnesses? Do they have any bad habits? Have they done anything bad?</p>
<p>"If you have faults, don't hesitate to correct them." The ancients have already shown us the path to self-renewal. Children with weak bodies should pay attention to daily hygiene, practice exercise often, and strengthen their bodies. Children who are behind in their studies should concentrate on learning, strive for knowledge, and their studies will surely improve. Children with bad behavior should change their bad habits and cultivate good character. They should also not miss classes, obey discipline, pay attention to current events, be enthusiastic about service... Only then will they be a completely good student.</p>
<p>"Past mistakes will not be held against you, the future can be pursued!" Children! Rise up! Quickly create a "new me"!</p>
<h3>The Spirit of English Children</h3>
<p>— Zhang Mengzhao</p>
<p>The spirit of English children! It can serve as a model for Chinese children during wartime! A report from Reuter's London states: A British ship carrying evacuated English children was hit by a German submarine torpedo in the Atlantic Ocean en route to Canada. However, none of the children were killed. The ship carried a total of 320 children... The only casualty was the ship's accountant. The children sang loudly as they left the ship into lifeboats! More than 70 of them, mostly wearing nightgowns, landed last night at a port in northern England... The children abandoned ship and boarded rescue ships in an orderly manner!... The Under-Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, Shakespeare, welcomed the survivors, saying: Their safe return is truly a miracle! The children were in high spirits upon landing! "As if nothing had happened..." and so on.</p>
<p>The calm and courageous spirit of English children in the face of danger! It can truly be said: "Not surprised when Mount Tai collapses in front of them, not afraid when a tiger stalks behind them." Children, after you finish reading this news report, think about your own situation and how the little angels in Chongqing are suffering amidst the bombings. If everyone can emulate the spirit of those English children, I believe that the cornerstone of a revitalized China will undoubtedly be built on your children. Children! Quickly develop your little hero spirit!</p>
<h3>A Dinner Party of Seven Foreign Children</h3>
<p>— Hanqing</p>
<p>A Chinese child, an American child, an English child, a French child, a German child, an Italian child, and a Japanese child; these seven children one day, grouped together to have dinner at a cafe.</p>
<p>They had many good breads, pastries, and candies, as well as a large can of vegetable oil purchased at the cafe.</p>
<p>As they were happily eating, a strange insect suddenly fell from the air, landing right in the large can of vegetable oil.</p>
<p>The Chinese child was the first to see it, but he didn't say anything, and continued to sit and talk as before.</p>
<p>The American child saw it next, and he exclaimed loudly: "Ah! A very dirty monster has flown into this wonderful can of vegetable oil!"</p>
<p>The English child was annoyed by the American friend's loud exclamation, and said calmly: "Friend! Just get it out and remove some of the oil nearby!"</p>
<p>The French child curiously picked up the can to look at the monster, and said with admiration: "Ah! What a beautiful little thing, its two delicate wings are stuck to the vegetable oil."</p>
<p>The German child walked over silently, carefully took the insect out of the can, and said: "This is an uncommon insect, let me take it back and observe it carefully." Saying that, he looked at the insect, wrapped it up, and prepared to put it in his pocket to take it back.</p>
<p>The Japanese child suddenly stood up, snatched the paper package from the German child, and threw the insect back into the can of vegetable oil. He took it to the shop owner and said aggressively: "Bah! Look, there's this dirty thing in the vegetable oil, quickly exchange it for a new can! Otherwise, humph! Don't even think about getting our money!"</p>
<p>The Italian child was angered by the Japanese child's unreasonable behavior towards the German child, and prepared to fight; however, when he saw that the Japanese child had indeed obtained a new can of vegetable oil from the shop owner, he remained silent.</p>
<h3>Shirley Temple's Autobiography (14)</h3>
<p>— Min</p>
<p>But Mom could only get me a salary of fifty gold dollars per week, and she couldn't get a good contract. Until the end of that summer, Mom received a phone call from the Educational Film Corporation, asking her to come and negotiate. It was said that they were going to start filming a series of short films called "Baby Burlesks" and were willing to give me a role. Mom immediately accepted, but the contract was still not finalized. They wanted me to first perform in one film as a test, and if the results were not bad, then I could continue. Almost all the actors in the film were middle school students, and there were also a few adults participating. The role I played was the little sister of a male student in the film. I was the youngest of all the actors, only four and a half years old at the time.</p>
<p>Corne, this is a good thing, you should know some. Although I had already made several films, I didn't go to the cinema often. Before I entered the film industry, Dad and Mom almost never went to the cinema. Dad would say to me that he didn't like movies. I remember the first movie I ever saw was Mickey Mouse, and I still think it's the best. Last year at the Academy Awards banquet, I met Mr. Walt Disney, the creator of Mickey Mouse, and I told him that I loved Mickey Mouse the most. Mr. Disney replied: "That's great, I'll send it to your house. If you really love it, then keep it." The next day, Mickey Mouse actually came: it wasn't the flat thing on the screen, but a substantial one like a black bear, and I also got its partner, Minnie. The two of them are still sitting in my toy cabinet, what a sweet couple!</p>
<p>Mom said that the first time I watched a film I starred in myself, it was in a cinema near my house. I kept laughing and clapping my hands. Mom kept whispering to me: "Can you see yourself? Hehe, that's you! That's you!" It's very interesting to see yourself appear on the screen. Corne, listening to the words you say evokes a very strange feeling. The sound seems especially loud, and I seem to want to warn myself: "Shirley, be quiet, if you keep making such a noise, I'm afraid you'll wake everyone up."</p>
<p>Dad was with us that first night to see my debut work. He was very happy after watching it. When it was all over, I saw that he seemed to be about to cry, clearly very moved. Now, all the new films I star in can be watched to our heart's content in the small cinema at the studio. We don't have to spend any money, and we can watch them whenever we want. Just call out to the person who runs the films: "Hey, hurry up and start it, we want to watch it." Then the lights go out immediately, and the film starts immediately.</p>
<h3>Talking About Goldfish</h3>
<p>— Yuyin</p>
<p>Children like goldfish because of their beautiful colors. Indeed, golden red, tangerine yellow, snow white, jet black... swimming among green algae and white water is so poetic and picturesque! Moreover, in addition to their beautiful colors, their shapes also have unique features: crepe-like tail fins, round and tight bodies, paired with those bulging and round eyes, like a clown on the stage, very pleasing. Therefore, goldfish are not only liked by you children, but also by many adults who have lost their innocence and enjoy appreciating them.</p>
<p>Some people say that silkworm cocoons can be transformed into goldfish, which is nonsense. Don't believe it. How do goldfish become goldfish? Goldfish are originally a mutation of carp. According to a French zoologist, Mr. Tournier, "Goldfish have become the shape of goldfish because, in the early stages of their life, the energy of the embryo is weakened due to the lack of oxygen in the water." This is likely correct. Goldfish are indeed a kind of morbid mutation; we can prove it by observing the slow movement of goldfish. Those that are similar in shape to carp are easier to raise, healthier, and more lively, which is because their morbid state is lighter and they are less affected.</p>

<h3>Mid-Autumn Festival Play Talk</h3>
<p>— Junmei</p>
<p>Besides "Celestial Fragrance Celebrates the Festival," "Chang'e Flying to the Moon," and "Emperor Tang Ming's Journey to the Moon Palace," there are truly few stage plays that are fitting for the Mid-Autumn Festival. And among these few plays, the main roles are all played by female characters, and the scenes are all extremely simple. Compared to the fiery and lively Qixi Festival plays, they are far inferior. Therefore, in recent years, the Peking Opera scene has used "Catching and Releasing Cao" and "Wujia Slope" as Mid-Autumn Festival plays, because the lyrics in "Catching and Releasing Cao" contain "Osmanthus fragrance in the Mid-Autumn of August," and "Wujia Slope" also has the line "The moon is bright on the fifteenth of August." They use these as a contrived association to embellish the festive season. In fact, the Mid-Autumn words in these two plays were not part of the scene at the time, and "Wujia Slope" is especially a narration of past events. As for those who criticize the actors for their ignorance for this reason, that is perhaps being too serious!</p>
<p>Mei Wan Hua became famous first in Qing Yi, and then his name became more prominent with ancient costume opera. The play "Chang'e Flying to the Moon" is undoubtedly Mei's masterpiece. At that time, Fan Fanshan, Yi Kukuang, and other elders highly praised Mei's play. During the Mid-Autumn Festival of a certain year in the early Republic of China, Wan Hua performed this play in the former capital, and Fan Shan recited a long song in praise of it, saying: "Tonight the people are good, and the moon is also good, the people in the moon are even more beautiful than flowers! Who can be called Chang'e? In ancient and modern times, Lanfang is the most beautiful." The passion was overflowing in his words. Since Mei's retirement from the singing stage, there have been very few talented newcomers in ancient costume opera, so even if "Chang'e Flying to the Moon" is performed during the Mid-Autumn Festival, it is often promoted with mechanical scenery, no longer with the beautiful singing and dancing of the past.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes from the Film World</h3>
<p>— Qinghui</p>
<p>The late star Fan Pengke traveled to the East several years ago, and Mei Lanfang held a grand banquet for Fan at the Zhuiyu Xuan in Wuliangdaren Hutong in Beijing. Although Fan claimed to be a warrior, he especially admired ancient Chinese warriors. After a few drinks, he took off his Western suit and put on a Wu Song costume, and his brave spirit and generosity were praised by all who watched.</p>
<p>In the past, some people used flowers to compare the looks of female stars, saying: Hu Die resembles a peony, rich and magnificent, a rare treasure of Yaochi; Wang Ying resembles a cherry blossom, delicate and charming, full of stimulation; Xu Lai resembles a begonia, loved by the spring rain, and its voice is likened to the morning glow; Ruan Lingyu resembles an epiphyllum, a beautiful woman with a short life, a common tragedy throughout the ages; Hu Ping resembles a Jian orchid, pure and quiet; Gao Qianping resembles a grape, with many children and grandchildren; Diao Banhua resembles a monthly rose, which can be seen everywhere, and Lin Chuchu resembles a winter plum, ancient and fragrant.</p>
<p>The film world clown Han Langan usually looks funny, so he has many nicknames; one is "Skinny Monkey" because he is as thin as firewood and his appearance resembles a monkey; another is "Mantis Man" because his shoulders are high and he is thinner than a mantis; the third is "Bony Xi Shi" because he is all bones and especially acts coy.</p>
<p>Female stars are all very secretive about their real ages. In the past, when Yang Naimei was very popular, someone asked her how old she was, and she answered twenty-four! The following year, when another film producer asked, she answered twenty-four. Reducing her age year by year can be said to be interesting.</p>
<p>On the day of film queen Hu Die's wedding, she wore a black satin top with wide sleeves that opened in the front, about three feet long, with a red satin long skirt underneath. Her body was decorated with hundreds of silver butterflies of all sizes, and she wore a row of red flowers in her hair with white gauze on her shoulders that was four or five zhang long, extremely gorgeous.</p>
<p>Hawthorn Detective Case</p>
<h3>The Final Destination of the Dance Queen</h3>
<p>— Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter Seven "Take Him Away"</p>
<p>Hawthorn said, "Since you said Xiao Zeng saw that person's face, how could you recognize him from those dark gray suit pants?"</p>
<p>"No, I also saw his face later." "Oh, so when did this time of trespassing and peeking happen?"</p>
<p>"Around eight o'clock after the clocks chimed. When we came out of the White Plum Restaurant a little before nine o'clock, I saw this Zhao fellow."</p>
<p>Hawthorn seemed to pay more attention. "How?"</p>
<p>"At that time, I was waiting for the car to come, but Li Lan grabbed my arm, looking very frightened. Her eyes were constantly looking left and right, and I naturally followed her gaze. Suddenly, she exclaimed, piercing my ears. I saw her gaze focused on the opposite side of the road, and sure enough, it was that Zhao fellow!"</p>
<p>I thought to myself that if this story was true, combined with Jinmei's description of Zhao Boxiong's nervous appearance when he went to Wang Lilan's house for dinner last night, it was indeed somewhat serious.</p>
<p>Hawthorn still asked lightly: "What happened after that? Did this Zhao fellow see you?"</p>
<p>Lu Jiansheng shook his head: "I don't know. I saw him for only a moment, and in the blink of an eye, he disappeared into the crowd. We were originally going to the Shanghai Theater to see 'Battlefield Oriole,' but at this time, Li Lan suddenly said she didn't want to go. I knew that she was frightened because of that Zhao fellow, so I tried my best to encourage her, and she reluctantly got into the car with me."</p>
<p>Hawthorn asked, "What time was it then?"</p>
<p>"Around nine o'clock, because the movie started at a quarter past nine."</p>
<p>"You must have asked her why she was afraid of this Zhao fellow. What did she say?"</p>
<p>"Yes, but I wasn't satisfied. She said that she originally didn't have any relationship with this person, but because I wanted her to break off contact with him, he hated her for it. Her words were very high-sounding, but I was afraid there was some other secret."</p>
<p>"How do you know? What is the basis for the secrets you mentioned? Because if she really listened to your words and suddenly broke up with him, it is also possible that he would hate her out of jealousy and threaten her." (107)</p>
<h3>Written Discussion of "One Horse, Two Riders"—Reply to Mr. Zheng Yaozu</h3>
<p>— Dong Yunxiu Yan</p>
<p>I read Mr. Zheng Yaozu's article in yesterday's issue of this publication, regarding the "One Horse, Two Riders" scene in my book "Twenty Kinds of Ballads," which is part of the "Civil and Military Scented Ball" chapter. I am grateful for his insight.</p>
<p>Mr. Zheng's opinion is that when "One Horse, Two Riders" are on the horse, Long Guanbao should have his limbs tied behind his back, and be tied to Zhang Guiying back-to-back. The reason is that there are two reasons: Second, because Long Guanbao is a weak scholar, he is afraid that he will not be able to withstand the bumps on horseback. Second, Long Guanbao's hands are free, and he may have unruly behavior.</p>
<p>The first point has a considerable reason; the second point is just a "gimmick" of the "ballad singer."</p>
<p>According to the facts, even if Zhang Guiying is agile, she would definitely not dare to tie Long Guanbao behind her back! Just imagine: with a six-foot-tall man tied behind her back, galloping across the mountains, is that something a young woman can handle? As for "preventing problems before they happen," fearing that Guanbao's hands may have unruly behavior, it is even more unreasonable! At this time when everything hangs by a thread and life is at stake, how can there be such leisure?</p>
<p>The same ballad has several versions. Ju Yuquan's version is one way of telling the story, while Chen Lianqing and Qi Lianfang's version is another way. There is no absolute right or wrong in the world, and we certainly don't have to "stick to the string while playing the lute."</p>
<p>We are just discussing with Mr. Zheng, not "arguing." We are truly grateful for Mr. Zheng's well-intentioned discussion!</p>
