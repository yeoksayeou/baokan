<h3 id="c5">日本外交之困境 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>日本對華侵略，雖爲國際所一致譴責，然彼在國際的外交活動則始終小懈。即如最近：（一）日本外務省特使河井，遊歷南北美洲各國之後，己於本月八日抵達倫敦，並將轉赴歐洲大陸，分訪法德比荷諸國。（二）另一特使伊藤，亦於本月十二日離東京、假道西比利亞，赴歐活動。（三）日本駐蘇大使東鄕，曾於本月十九日與蘇聯國外貿易人民委員長米高陽進行談話，事後日方報紙並放出空氣，謂蘇聯政府願不惜任何代價，與日本成立協定，俾得在東南歐自由、活動云云，但蘇聯官辦通信社旋即受命加以否認。（四）東京方面又宣傳英國曾向日本提議訂立英日新的，後來也被英國所否認了。此外，（五）日本的報章雜誌，近來對於如何打開外交僵咸，討論得特別熱鬧。日本對於言論，素來統制極嚴，戰時尤甚，報章雜誌不容易說話，所以談談外交，並借以發洩其對於政肘之不滿，固然是事實；但是日本朝野因侵華戰事失利而苦悶日深，所以想在外交上打一條出路，却也上下一致地表現出來了。</p>
<p>但是這條出路，不但不容易打通，簡直是打不通的；只要分析客觀情勢，就不難了然。遠東國際舞臺上的主角，中日之外，是英美和蘇聯；世界國際舞臺上的主角，英美蘇之外，還有法德義。日本想在外交上找出路，其主要對象，富然不外英美蘇法德義六國。這六國各有所亟，各有所私，但以遠東問題來分析他們，則英美蘇法是一組，其利在乎維持中國獨立完整與門戶開放，並保護其在華物質的與精神的權益；德義又是一組，她們在遠東的利權少，關係輕，但是她們在歐洲却高喊着打破現狀。日本的目標，在推翻遠東現狀，獨霸中國，其自然的趨勢，是聯合德義以抗英美蘇法，所以從廣田內閣經林內閣，近衛內閣，直到平沼內閣，其外交方向，都走德義路綫，標榜了防共協定之名，實行其分頭侵略之實。可是這種局勢，到去年八月發生了重大變化；德蘇協定的簽訂，根本毀滅了防共協定的防錢。那時候，正是日本經過了兩年餘的侵華戰爭，國力就衰，難乎爲繼，正需要外來援助；而德國方在歐洲掀開戰慕，自顧不暇；義大利又是列强中最貧窮的國家，當然也沒有餘力來援助泥淖中的日本。因此之故，日本對德義，由失望而絕望。</p>
<p>日本旣失望絕望於德義，勢不能不轉變其外交路綫。所以去秋阿部登台以後，親兼外相，宣布他的外交方針，是「還原於白紙』；所謂『還原於白紙』，實際就是對英美送秋波，而尤片面鍾情於美國。這時美國甫經宣布廢棄美日商約，而美日商約實際還未滿期；日本旣因對內安慰人民的政治必妥，又因對華企圖封鎖的國際必要，更因軍需原料以及對外貿易上的經濟必要，都重大依存於美國；遂想用外交手法，誘惑美國，重結新歡。於是號稱「美國通」的野村繼任外相了，但是終阿部內閣之任，到底無濟於事。今年一月中旬米內登台不過一旬，而美日關係終於進入無、條約狀態。而且自此以後，日本每動作一步，美國壓力必加緊一步：如三月三十日日本把南京改組之後，及本月十五日日外相有田對荷屬東印度問題發表言論之後，美國務卿赫爾氏都嚴正地說明了美國不苟的態度。即使沒有陶格西少將的演辭，沒有美政府的加强對日道德禁運，任何人也都可以了然於美日之決不能妥協了。於是日本又轉移其勾引目標於蘇聯，於英國，然而英蘇都立即發出無意向日本示妥協約聲明。</p>
<p>將目前的遠東國際形勢綜合起來講，德義沒有餘可以援助日本；英國有相當的餘力，美蘇則有充分的餘力，但是並不援助日本，却無一而不與日本顯明的站於對立地位。當中日戰事初起之時，日本自恃武力强盛，以爲短時期內即可征服中國，以爲祗要把征服中國的旣成事實，置之各國之前，各國便無可奈何；所以橫衝直撞，不顧外交。老實說：假定中國不抗戰而屈服，如捷克，如丹麥；假定中國抗戰而一敗塗地，如阿比西尼亞，如阿爾巴尼亞；假定中國抗戰半途而廢，如芬蘭；則日本早已躊躇志滿，各國確亦不過徒喚奈何。日本不料所遭遇的事實敎訓，是長期抗戰，是堅强抗戰，使他不能不顧外；並且因爲侵華戰事深陷泥淖之故，惟有想在外交上找一條出路，以濟其軍事之窮，但不可得。造成目前日本這種外交絕境的，正是日本本身盲目的侵略，忽視了客觀情勢。原來蘇聯在遠束，有廣大的屬土；英國在遠東，屬地不多而利權特廣；美國呢，其立國的生命即寄托在太平洋；法國則是英國的盟邦，處境相同，利害相共。因此之故，日本對亞洲大陸及太平　的侵略政策一日不放棄，美蘇英法即一日不能安枕，亦即一日不能和日本妥協。這樣重大的外交孤立之危機。是日本所不能擔負的。放下屠刀，可以立地成佛，繫鈐解鈴、只在一念之間；但是今日的日本，却不足以語此。</p>

<p>里賓特羅甫宣稱、自若干星期前英海相邱吉爾發表演說以來、英法政治家所發表之言論、均含有請各中立國參加對德戰爭之要求、里氏又臚舉英國各政治家如首相張伯　海相邱吉爾外相哈立法克斯工程部長華爾及古柏等之演詞以證其說、里氏繼又述及芬蘭、謂英法所稱挪威及瑞典如尤許其軍隊假道、則準備援助芬蘭云云、實屬完全不確、據稱、德政府探知芬蘭駐法公使曾於三月十二日報吿其本國政府、謂達拉第與邱吉爾二人巳於芬蘭提出請求後向其切實保證、英法軍隊將立即由整裝待發之海口啟程、以便在挪威登陸、對挪瑞兩國、將祗以一紙牒文通知軍隊之假道、而並不請求兩國政府之尤許、三月十一日邱氏乘飛機赴巴黎、以期對於妨阻芬蘇和平作最後之努力、此次德軍在挪威所搜獲之文件、更可證明英法之謀擴張戰事至北歐方面、據在那維克獲得之文件、證明英國閒諜會沿挪威西海岸一帶研究登陸之善策、當時之挪威政府雖秘密同情於協約國之計劃、但此種間諜仍活動如故、里氏又稱、邱氏會於招待中立國訪員時無意中洩露英國之眞正目的、當時邱氏痛斥挪瑞丹三國、謂必須阻止鐵砂運抵德國、德政府觀察所得之各方情報、對於瑞典之嘗顧及其中立地位、並無違反中立之行爲、頗爲滿意、在另一方面、則德政府已獲有文件、證明挪威政府不但同意協約國擴大戰事之計劃、且對於西方列强所提議之行動予以積極贊助、據最近在挪威發見之資料、可見英國在挪之間諜制度、係得挪政府之完全支持、吾人更早巳獲得證據、知挪政府已決心加入協約方面共同作戰、三月二日挪威政府舉行會議時、其首相及外相均對此發表言論、除上述各種文件外、尙有協約國在中立國之許多其他行動、如間諜人員在巴爾幹之搗亂行爲等、均可證明其欲使戰事儘量蔓延之意嚮、</p>

<p>倫敦　此間軍界人士頃公開承認聯軍在挪戚特隆漢港南面處境困難、但謂觀於聯軍日來不顧艱險、在全錢奮勇反攻之所爲、此種困難情形原屬意料中事、無須悲觀、據可靠消息、自特隆漢港北進之德軍、已與自哈梅爾城通往該港鐵路綫上之德軍會合、然則在該鐵路綫東段之挪威守軍、殆已被德軍所擊敗、至英法聯軍雖已退至唐勃斯城南面、但該城仍在聯軍手中、是以仍有通往特隆漢港之鐵路綫條、爲聯軍所控制、此外聯軍方面尙佔有兩種便利、（一）唐勃斯城一帶之接濟幷未斷絕、聯軍生力部隊登陸後、軍威業巳一振、仍可自唐勃斯城以威脅加諸斯多蘭城、（二）德國空軍原極猖獗、但英法空軍實力巳於本日獲有補充、今後當可恢復均勢、蓋聯軍方面現已備有大批高射砲與驅逐機羣、足以抵禦德國機羣也、至於特隆漢港正北面之戰事形勢、並無變動、英法聯軍仍可自海岸獲有補充、沿海一帶與東部鐵路綫上之德軍雖獲有聯絡、但因英法聯合　隊依然控制斯加基拉克與加特蓋脫兩海峽之故、德方運輸艦能開抵目的地者爲數不多、依目下情勢而論、北路英法聯軍或將撤退至特隆漢港正北面之陣地集中、但此舉尙未完全決定、即便出此、亦屬暫時性質、則以英法聯軍在戰船上、決不放棄主動地位云、（二十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>挪威地勢　作戰困難</p>
<p>瑞典京城　瑞典著名新聞記者赫德基斯特、昨日在「日報」發表一文、對於目前戰局加以論列、認爲挪威對德之軍事抵抗、殊無忍義、因整個歐洲作戰之困難、未有如挪威之形勢者、蓋其可耕之土、不過百分之二。五、百分之二十四爲森林、其餘概爲荒山野地、山脈縱橫、其次所有挪威城鎭凡人口在一萬人以上者、除北部之特隆梭外、其餘均在德軍手中、人口在五千以上者共三十城、而爲德軍佔領者巳達二十三城、故該記者認爲再從事軍事抵抗、殊爲徒勞無功云（二十七日海通社電）</p>

<p>紗市繼升、目漲風尤熾、雖實際銷路、益覺淸淡、然人心非常熱烈也、至於外滙平軟、黃金反見下挫、惟棉紗棉花兩項、竟成有漲無跌之勢、火概爲籌碼關係耳、最近兩日之市面、大都被套利者所拉起、</p>
<p>現紗晨開人氣異常然烈、大家都喊買進、二十支雙馬廠單始做一千四百九十元、再一跳出關價爲一千五百〇八元、此時買戶猶如潮湧、直漲至一千五百三十八元、中途稍回、跌至一千五百十八元、迨至收盤、又復上升至一千五百三十五元、查半日間成交統計一千七百四十五句、行情二十支雙馬漲四十元、廠方由統益廠開出廿三支金鷄五十包、價爲一千四百九十元、新生廠開出四支紅萬字三百包、價爲六百元、又棉紗今日有一百四十五件運往廈鬥、又十件運往香港、茲將各幫口買去之額量、分列如左、</p>

<p>本棉交易尙屬平平、惟印棉成交愈形熱鬧、此因紗市良好靑島方面稍有需要華日廠採辦仍滯乏勁也、茲將現棉成交情形列左、</p>

<p>另訊、外棉市價、紐約棉市、昨日晨初開盤即活躍殊甚、同時因現貨交易之良好及海外商之在市購買頗烈、結果收盤價格較之上日漲五六磅音、印度棉市因上海印棉交易之活躍、昨日連同預測激漲六　比、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、昨日期貨交易巳逐漸靜寂、然現貨交易反趨活躍、蓋因一般同業經濟運用比較困難者、被另有一般同業款項寬裕者所殺價購買、各方俱見棉價之將高漲因需款殷急、不得不就此出售、此項交易較之洋行方面售價竟廉去三四十元之多、茲將昨日棉市以美滙六元折合送廠價如下、</p>

<p>外滙昨日市况、滙豐掛牌、悉無上落、英美滙暗市、走勢未改、論上落範圍、極爲狹隘、買賣情况、殊形平凡、投機商對遠期頻頻賣出、致鬆態最爲顯著、如五月份美滙時做開、巳賤至五元八四三七五、嗣以賣風即散、市象逐漸回平、但結果五日期美滙仍形微硬、至木日套利交易、會聞做開、投機商貼進約爲二一八七五、合息在四分以上、</p>
<p>交易殊形平凡</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條、近遠均趺一二五、紐約銀價仍平、倫敦生金呆定、滙兌英對美滬法等各滙俱平、美對英跌一二五、對滬不動、對法亦未更、中央掛牌各滙如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金四辦士一二五、美滙六元〇三一二五、較上日晚收英美皆平、同時期貨開出亦無變化、開後投機商首懷賣意、會吐予外行四月份美滙六元〇六二五、滙豐掛牌揭曉不動、白銀平衡稅揭曉降七角五分、此後外行互做四月份美滙、亦爲六元〇六二五、斯時市面本巳見硬、再以投機商力塞、雖籌碼並不充溢、無如外行等進胃不旺、故五月份美滙投機商賣與外行祗五元八四三七五、並華僑進投機商四月份英金巳吿四辦士一四〇六二五、目聞小呂宋來電、賣予外行五月份美滙、其價均屬五元八四三七五、不久賣戶漸臧、午收市象即吿回平、現貨英金仍四辦士一二五、美匯六元〇三一二五四月份英金四辦士一二五、美滙六元〇三一二五、五月份英金三辦士八四三七五、美滙五元八一二五、較隔昨期貨及四月份俱平、五月份英平、美鬆〇三一二五、午後週六無市、</p>
<p>香港美匯獨緊</p>
<p>香港二十七日（週六）電、今晨滙市開盤平穩、美滙現貨緊〇六二五，爲二十一元七五、其餘均無榮辱、十一時三十分平穩、各滙概無變動、下午週六無市、</p>
<p>天津英美平定</p>
<p>天津二十七日（週六）電、今晨進市開盤吿平、英美滙現貨仍吿平穩無榮辱、申匯降二角五分、爲一百十一元五角、「聯鈔」暗盤昂四角、爲一百〇二元七角半、</p>

<p>二十六日倫敦電、大條銀市近遠月期均縮一二五、大衆稍有供給、少交易、市况平、收市後市面呆平、又紐約電美銀　現貨未更、孟買電、印銀現貨與近期升八安那、遠月長九安那、布况平、成交單共五十張云、</p>
<h3 id="c55">美金票　欲漲無力 <a href="#c55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>昨日央美金鎊、因烚赤依舊疲弱、多方無力活動故仍不乏供給、市價依然萎靡不振、英金票及杳港票供求仍甚均勻、市價鮮有變動、美金票因外匯期貨鬆動、終於欲漲無力、晨初又曾抬至十六元三角七分、但不接踵又爲特貨者趁高拋售而抑低、晚市退爲十六元三角一分、比上日續降三分、法郎票供塞不終、市價仍　軟弱、日金票初尙平穩、午後賣氣父盛、晚市退爲一元二角六分四厘、朝鮮票跌風巳戢、晚市巳回上至九角八分五厘、</p>
<h3 id="c56">都只為銀根所迫　金市多頭一籌莫展　最低見五五八〇元 <a href="#c56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤　盤市况、因週六關係、例祇半天行市、　勢不良、每况愈下、計連跌竟有八天之多、尙以下降速度較之上漲爲低、故總軋亦僅撳落二白餘元、至本日全盤起伏曲折而無大掀動、晨開以迄午收、某綫兌業　某證券帮吐售最力、不久一度頭寸供求懸殊、會破入五千六百元關內見五千五百八十元低價、賴銀號金號帮等從專搜購、拉住得力、結果收盤為五千六百十元、較上日父降二十五元、午後塲外鮮聞成交、半天交易約二千兩左右、銀樓飾金掛小五元、海關金等仍平、</p>
<p>烚赤己連小八天</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初開人心頗疲、金號等撳價賣出、缺乏受主、開市克跌三十五元、銀號出銀樓帮及同業共六十兩、均爲五干六百元、嗣有散戶見賤做多、加之余號亦買、頓回起二十元、金號互做十兩、爲五千六百二十元、但其時某錢兌業上日所吸之貨、忽思出　、而散戶見景亦獲利吐出、且買者納胃不健、頭寸頓感寬裕、又步落十五元、證券帮出銀樓二十兩、爲五千六百零五元、後某銀號突代客戶力拖、目賣風一時稍挫、重見回升十元、銀號進錢兌業十兩、爲五千六百十五元、此後證劵帮忽來傾吐、某銀號亦轉買爲賣、而某錢兌業亦來競塞、一時賣風擴大、立慘入五千六百元大關、證券帮出金號二十兩、遜爲五千五白八十元、某銀號曁金號等”賤塌便宜撈進、目散戶拋空者見勢抵補、不久遂回出五千六百元大關、後再加銀號帮紛來跟扒、父回高十餘元、金號互做三十兩、爲五千六百十八元、將近收盤時、買風稍戢、再小八元、金號出銀號十兩、爲五千六百十元作午收價、結果比上日續跌二十五元、查巳連小八天、共計二百十七元、半天四十元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤較高數元收進减低二十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十餘元、均鮮做開、</p>
<p>飾金再掛小五元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、初時大同行仍懸五白七十元、迨至十時光景掛小五尤、此後無變化、計大同行改懸五百六十五元、新同行與上價相同、收進减低十五元光景、</p>

<p>布市昨爲本月份期貨交割最忙之一天、以紗價猛漲、及下月份明貨紗布均開出高價、套利竟達七八分鈿、現貨布價貴者、愈有人落手、以便於脫售、故售價亦最漲得起、而市上　貨甚多、以實銷不振、囤戶捨而不顧、售盤多數呆定、凡此都是投機下之局面、昨大鵬富貴細布·細斜、每疋漲五角至一元、怡和組布漲　角半、綸昌怡和漂染布以客銷平淡、手　巳較行盤爲廉、本　成交各布以五穴月份期貨居多、約十餘萬疋、客銷均乏躉額、滇粤帮需胃較佳、</p>
<p>東布市氣續堅、十二磅龍頭細布晨開每疋四十六元二角半、嗣以紗價升騰、實銷雖不暢達、而業內外囤購心思、依舊旺盛、故收市時之龍頭現棧單售開四十六元四角、下月份期貨升至四十八元半、四君子嗶嘰現出增至每碼一元四角三分半、下月期一元五角一分、</p>
<p>布疋出口、二十八日運廈門二百件、運香港四百四十五件、運天津三百十八件、運烟台二百五十件、</p>

<p>米市自前日午前轉昂、午後冉度回軟後、昨晨初開勢即遜色、卒吿回跌、乃以此香漲風、全由於心思之激盪所造成、並無根基、易於搖動、况補空不常、實銷欠旺、此種市而明知勉强、勢乏持久之力、所以懷貨者遂均趁此佳檔、紛紛將獲利貨回出然買方　抱觀望、無意相受、市面遂難維持、立呈疲熊、各色洋米行情落低六七角不一、若小絞開四十一元七八角、此後略有本鄉店胃因今日星期例　、乘廉添備、疲勢方始稍殺、漸趨盤旋、而中間雖會經過一番激盪、然全係心思作用、轉　將吿回軟、所以結果收盤行情較之前市卒低半元左右、計一號西貢爲四十六元、混合碎及米菉獨以供求相仿、無甚榮辱、</p>
<p>粳糯國米積到二千餘包、銷場方面以價盤較洋米爲低、頗屬活絡、然客販因恐天時關係、米身易起變化、亦願輟脫、故市面未有上落、惟一般宿熱貨較爲疲弱、有貶三五角者、計市上做開常錫宿粳祇四十元、三十九　半、南港斛早三十九元半、三十九元、糯米亦然相仿、溧丹鮮元似售三十八九元、而身首濕軟及宿次者僅卅五六元而巳、</p>
<p>洋米前日飛黃騰達、似有再度漲　高峯之趨勢、奈昨日開市後、實銷嫌昂觀望、客帮未能續辦、而杜米亦繼洋米湧到、日商尤多貶價求晚、且在銀根奇緊之際、一般獲利浮多無不急於脫手、雖行號大戶尙圖堅持、而市面終被浮戶出籠所抑低，高次各洋米均比前日同降四五角、惟回籠期貨仍有囤戶收進、原根行號亦有收回、新定除前日一批低水脚貨成交後未能蟬聯續定、因此四五月份二號西實仍開到九十三元半、原根結價則為五十三元、全日成二百多噸、現貨約六千包、</p>

<p>麵粉　昨現粉交易平淡、因出口帮客銷久滯、本街零批亦受內地粉傾銷影響、進胃有減無增、統市由廠方直接批出者僅五千包左右、二號粉廠盤仍爲十三元八角、老車牌同籠貨別小一角、但以買賣擯持、未有妥交、又聞常錫內地粉價爲十三元二三角、成交亦有一三千包、悉由本街辦去云、</p>
<p>小麥　昨交易冉度擯持、蓋以目下來源久乏、存底早枯、陳麥巳屆落令新麥上市、雖爲期尙遠、而麥苗滋長甚速、本年麥收望豐、廠方擬在此時抑小、而執貨者則尙思扳守、結果又乏成交、聞送廠貨因值週末之期亦吿沉靜、</p>

<p>證劵暗盤、昨日市况極爲平穩、多方欲抬、限於爲力不足空方欲壓、又感無現貨之流動、高利貸款、做多已與公債本身利息所得爲不合、借貸放款、必爲　有現貨者之拒絕、因與多方不利也、故市上買進者爲空頭了結居多、賣出者爲多方不願受高利率之壓迫而脫手、新買賣則極少成交、市况因此形成盤旋、曁時尙不易展開也、昨日買賣各戶峯寥可數、大概鴻大及義泰偽買進、同康久豐及二十號爲賣出、交易下午尤稀、共計成交的五十萬有奇而已、茲列簡明表於後、</p>

<p>法租界愛多亞路十九號大美印刷所、（為英文大美晚報中文大美晚報及大美報之印刷所）、於昨晨五時零五分、大美報正在印刷之時、突遭暴徒襲擊、越捕一名、當塲殉職機器房工人三名、爲暴徒　擲手溜彈彈片所傷、當時捕房探捕與暴徒會有激鬥、互轟達十分鐘之久、流彈擊傷附近穿洋裝之路人及小販各一名、暴徒卒被兎脫、當暴徒汽車開足速力至北京路時、並撞斃路人一名、至大美報印刷機器、幸未傷及、正在件印之大美報、仍照常出版、茲誌詳情於後、</p>
<p>黎明刦車</p>
<p>襲擊大美印刷所之暴徒、係於昨晨三時〇五分、在預定地點、僱得祥生汽車公司膠州路分站第一八四二九號汽車一輛、當由第九號司機張某駕駛而出、暴徒囑開往康腦脫路金司徒廟、當車開至該處、車內暴徒、即突出盒子砲、威脅車夫下車、由另」暴徒帶往附近尾內監禁、預守該處之暴徒四名、當登車直駛天主堂街大美印刷所後門、</p>

<p>暴徒汽車、於昨晨五時〇五分駛抵大美印刷所後門、暴徙四名、隨即下車、該處本有一法捕房鐵甲車及越捕一名常川駐守、暴徒為避免注意、當由按日前來僞裝購報之暴徒一人、佯與該越捕交談、越捕不疑有他、致其餘三名得乘機混入、暴徒至機器房門前後、當即以手溜彈二枚向正在印刷之大美報機器猛擲、頃刻爆炸轟然一聲、附近各處門窗玻璃、均被震碎暴徒向英文大美晚報機器投擲一彈、但未爆炸、其時適大美報付印、幸僅炸屢皮帶、未毀機器、故略加修理、仍　續出版、惟較平時延近三小時而巳、</p>
<p>拒捕格鬥</p>
<p>暴徒見手溜彈爆炸後、當即由內逸出、躍上原車、向南圖遁、此時常川駐守於大美報門前之鐵甲車一輛、及中西探捕多人、已聞聲而至、當以手提機槍及步槍向暴徒汽車轟擊、暴徒一面開槍抵抗、一面開足速力、向南由公館馬路、折而東行轉入黃浦灘北駛、當暴徒汽車駛抵愛多亞路外灘時、鐵甲車及中西探捕乃向之密集轟擊、一時機槍盒槍步槍聲、轟然雜作、探捕以徒步無法追趕汽車、卒被逸去、暴徒逃逸時、並放烟皋彈掩護、雙方當時激戰十分鐘之久、車中有無暴徒受傷、無法得知、惟知該車在逸人北京路向西行進時、因其車行過速、目毫無顧忌、會撞斃路人一名、</p>
<p>越捕喪生</p>
<p>當暴徒　人大　印刷所投擲手溜彈時　留於其門前與三　四號越捕（Phan　Van　Phul）廿四歲談話之僞裝報販亦袖出手槍響應、繞至車後、出越捕不意、向共頭部轟擊一槍、該越捕以未有防範、遂致當塲殉職、暴徒向大美報印刷機投擲之炸彈爆發時、機器房工友、因未及走避、致有馮正卿（年卅四歲常州人）被炸傷右足部、製版房工友周永來、（揚州人年廿二歲）傷左腿部、李龍根（廿六歲浦東人、傷頭部、此外尙有在愛多亞路四川路轉角馬迪汽車公司門首賣餛飩之小販吳林生、爲槍彈擦傷面部、以上四人、以受傷不重、故由公共租界救護車送仁濟醫院、稍經包紮、即行出院、至殉職之越捕、旋由法捕房車送台拉斯脫路小病房、定星期一下午三時出殯、另在法租界外灘、流彈傷一名陳振卿（北平人穿西服廿歲）之行人一名、事後自投廣慈醫院療治、聞傷勢不重、</p>
<p>捕房注意</p>
<p>事後暴徒　僱之一八四二九號祥生汽車、已於昨晨八時許、被公共相界靜安寺捕房發現、車胎巳被槍彈擊破、汽車夫　某、亦巳被暴徒釋放、投捕房報告被刦持情形，兩租界當局對此案、極爲重視、法捕房各要　事後均親在調查、又暴徒　逃逸時、曾有手溜彈一枚遺落於天主堂街、巳山法捕房取去查騐、</p>

<p>成立日期</p>

<p>偽方企圖　把持捐稅</p>
<p>據傳筱庵表示、越界築路區徵收捐稅問題、確爲雙方談判中重要關鍵、但此項問題、擬於「特警」成立以後、始行談判、以往數年中、越界築路區域捐稅、向工部局徵收、但目前數月來、偽「市府」方面、亦曾強徵一部、故記者詢其將來捐稅是否仍將由雙方分別徵收、傳筱庵竟堅決表示、徵捐一事、將完全出　方主持、捐稅收入、則歸「特警署」全權支配、以作設立「特警隊」之經費、及經營越界築路區之用、對於此項收入、公共租界及偽「市府」方面、均不欲加以干涉、</p>

<p>越界築路區之賭窟、　稱、在「特警」成立後、或將被迫全部封閉、惟所取之步驟、將採取「遂漸取締」之法、故須在數月之後、越界築路區域之賭窟、始可完全肅清、最後、傳筱庵稱、「渠與工部局新總董雖未作習慣上應有之訪問、但渠信僞方與工部局間、感情仍極和洽」、最後渠復自詡與英美法三國駐滬總領事開之關係，亦頗密切、</p>

<h3 id="c96">怎樣選擇遊戲 <a href="#c96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>— 宛</p>
<p>小朋友們都是好動不好靜的，終日跳跳跑跑，沒有坐定的一刻，如果安靜下來，不外身體有了不適，否則總是一天到晚活動着，尤其「星期六星期日，家中地方狹小的或寬大的，都成爲臨時的遊戲塲，我在空閒的時候，往往在弄中走走，時常看見三五成羣的小朋友在玩着，他們玩的是什麼，大概是拍皮球，跳繩，打彈子，抽陀螺，踢皮球，在春初放風箏踢毽子等等，隨着性別時令興趣年齡不同時時改變，可是其間缺點，就是不知道選擇，這遊戲玩了有益，那遊戲玩了無益。</p>
<p>在學校中體育課裏有一部分時間給我們遊戲，有時敎師敎新的，有時由學生自己想新的，因為人數較多，玩的物件有限，所以玩法和我們在家裏的不同。遊戲旣然和兒童有這樣密切關係，一定有它相當價值，它能使身體運動，帮助消化，促進發育，在品性方面，能養成團體合作的精神，養成自治守紀律的習慣，同時使我們思思想靈活，舉動敏捷，如果我們能選擇得當，那麼使我們向各方面發育，反之，就要阻礙我們的發育，現在舉一件事實，證明不良的遊戲對於身體的影響。</p>
<p>有一個小朋友，他很喜歡打彈子，每天午飯後，約了幾個同學，在泥上挖了幾個洞，開始玩着，誰打中了誰的彈子，就贏得一粒，日久後，好像養成了賭博，贏了哈哈笑，輸了還想得回，於是天天打着玩，手指衣服老是滿着泥土，這樣獵續不斷的玩了好久，忽然有一天，這個小朋友肚子痛起來，痛得很厲害，他家裏人着急了，把他送到醫院裏，經醫生杳明說盲腸發炎，於是經過手術，受了許多痛苦才痊愈，可是他的身體比以前瘦弱得多了。</p>
<p>我們看了上面事實，知道遊戲是要選擇的，凡是具有賭博性的危險性的取巧性的都不可取，我們選擇的條件最緊要的是要對於我們有益，如能促進健康的，能發展思想的，能養成良好習慣的，都可採用，第二，才着重於興趣，我為什麽要這樣講呢？因為小朋友在以前只注重興趣而不想及身體，所以以後要改變我們的觀念才是。</p>
<p>遊戲是兒童應享的權利，所以小朋友要充分利用，適當的選擇，使我們在遊戲中得到真到真正的價值。</p>
<h3 id="c97">小朋友和勞動節 <a href="#c97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>— 楊春綠</p>
<p>五月一日，是世界勞動節。</p>
<p>勞動節約由來：當公元一八八六年，美國的工人因不願受資本家的虐待和剝削，便一致起來，要求每天二十四小時中，工作八小時，教育八小時是工人的工作時間縮短，資本家所得的利潤便减少，他們當然是不答應的。於是到了那年的五月一日，美國工業中心區支加哥的工人，因爲要求不遂，便舉行罷工的示威運動，集合了六萬多工人，出去遊行。在路上和警察衝突，被警察開槍打死了許多工人，領袖也被捕，其中有四人竟被絞死。</p>
<p>可是這一次偉大的犧牲，喚醒了全世界過着奴隸生活的工人。一八八九年，國際社會黨以工人的要求台理，不應受這無理的壓迫，因此世界勞工團體就在法幽巴黎開會，定這一天「世界勞動節」。在一勞工法」上也規定：工人每天做八小時工作，不許資本家隨意延長工人的工作時間。這是工人們由自己奮鬥得來的勝利。</p>
<p>我國的工人，在一九二〇年第一次慶祝這個「五一節」，以後雖每年在這一天舉行紀念，但是到了最近，抗戰發生之後，許多工廠倒閉的倒閉，停工的停工，所以失業的工人，成千成萬，簡直要活活餓死了</p>
<p>現在，「五一節」又將經過我們的眼前了。親愛的小朋友！你們都是復興中華民族的小工人，快，努力去　取你們的生路吧！</p>

<p>這是個春光明媚的季節，每逢假日，關於家裏是</p>
<h3 id="c99">黑兄弟（十六） <a href="#c99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>— 木</p>
<p>格勒忙道：「呀，你怎麼這樣的忍心」？黃金江的王勃然道：「忍心嗎？他們把那不聖潔的水倒在我的江中，我難道可以容許他們這樣的無禮嗎」？格勒急道：「階下怎麼會不聖潔呢？我明知他們是從禮拜堂的洗禮盆中取來的」。黃金江的王把臉色放得更莊重了，說道：「這詳是的，但他們不肯把這水去搭救那快要渴死的人畜，就不聖潔了，即使經過大上諸聖祝過福，也算不得聖水，惟有從慈悲的一念中所發出來的才是聖潔，即使浸過死屍，也玷污不了它」上，掛着三滴淸澈透明的露珠，他就把它來滴在格勒手　的水瓶裏，接着說道：「你把這適在江中，立刻趕下山的那的邊去，就可以通到百寶谷，你趕快去吧。」</p>
<p>說到這裏，他那矮矮的身子驀地模糊起來，那件肉色的長袍，也好似變成了一重淡白色的霧氣；他立了一會，彷彿有一條彩虹的帶子，散了開來。顏色漸衝地淡了，霧氣騰入空中，黃金江的王已幻滅了。</p>
<p>格勒呆看了半晌，很覺失望，原來他見那江水並沒有變做黃金，不過减少了一些，但他仍然聽從那矮王的話爬下山的那一邊去，向着百宝谷那面走，他走时，似乎听得地下有流水之声。到得他望见的百宝谷时，却見一條像黃金江般的河，從上面一塊岩石的躆兒急湧出來，分成無數的小溪，流過那一堆堆乾燥的紅沙。</p>
<p>格勒正在很奇怪的東張西望時，新的草在那新的溪邊長出來，攀藤的枯物，爬滿了滋潤的泥土，小巧的花，也一朶朶的開放着，鮮艷得很。這時黃昏　近，明星滿天，一叢叢的雁來紅，一條條的長春藤，在百寶谷中篩滿了影子。于是百寶谷重新變做了一座樂園，以前因殘酷而失去的財產，如今却因仁愛而恢復了。</p>
<p>格勒仍在百寶谷中，凡是窮苦的人上他的門去，從沒有空手回去的他的積穀倉中從此堆滿了五穀，他的屋子裏堆滿了才寶，這一條可正如那矮王所尤許他的，變做黃金江了。</p>
<p>直到如今，谷中的居民，總得指點那三滴聖水滴下的所在，就是地下黃金江的源流，一直通到百寶谷，而在上面黃金江的急流中，仍可瞧見兩塊黑石，天夕陽西下時，流水總在那裏鳴咽着。這兩塊黑石，大家都叫它們黑兄弟。　（完）怪悶氣的，尤其小孩子們都喜歡到戶外去嬉戲，就是在屋子中有挺好玩的遊戲，總不大願竟在室內玩。何况這幾天是這樣的和暖，春風似乎在臉上按摩，分個的舒適。</p>
<p>今天又是星　日了，阿蕙當然不能例外，不願躱在家裏，要他哥哥伴他到離家不遠的兆豐公園裏去玩玩，阿明起先現着不高興的神情，後來不知怎的，倒高興起來。</p>
<p>吃完了早餐，他們倆便踏上了車，一忽兒就到了目的地。遊人是特別的衆多，這因爲是休假日和天暖的緣故，門口的遊客還源源而來，大有把這樣一個偌大的公園擠滿的可能。兄弟倆踏進了公園的門口，一眼就見一大片的草坪，巳披上了嫩綠的靑衣，一堆堆的鮮花，五光十色的迎着人在笑，胸襟似乎是豁然開朗，異常的暢快，更擇一處幽靜的所在休憇一下。</p>
<p>「砰！砰！砰……」一陣突然刺耳的槍聲，把阿慧的心猛然的一擊。</p>
<p>「那是外國兵打靶的槍聲。」阿明早已知道弟弟受嚇，便很快的安慰他。阿慧聽了這話，倒使他緊張的情緒，和緩下來，原來他以爲發生什麼不測的事情。</p>
<p>「那打靶的地方離開我們這裏很近，似乎就在那邊，不然沒有這麼的饗喨。」阿慧手指着那邊，喃喃地說着。</p>
<p>「實際上不是你所說的那麼近，却離開得很遠哩，因為我們的耳朶一聽到槍聲，沒有確定它的距離的能力，卻能清楚地分辨槍聲從那一方向來的。剛才你所指的方向倒不錯。自左邊或右邊來的聲昔，最容易區別，假使聲音發生在我們的直前或背後，那就不易辨出它的來源了。因爲在　面射出的聲音，往往會從後面傳遞過來。說到這裏，却想起一個有趣味的遊戲—試騐聲音的來源。」阿明說到這裏，却打住了。阿慧當然要哥哥試騐，可是在公園裏怎能試騐呢？於是決定回到家裏去試騐，因此阿慧也無心去遊賞。他們倆在公園中兜了一周，便回去了。</p>
<p>一到了家，阿明領他弟弟到亭子間，把門窗緊閉了。把阿慧的兩眼用手巾包住了，他以為哥哥和他開玩笑，捉迷藏誰高興玩？那知更呌他坐了下來，不得動一動，就是頭也不許轉動。阿明尋到了兩塊硬板，把它們在平地上分置開，相間隔地在阿慧頭部的前後方敲擊、並且叫他分辯敲擊的木板在什麽地方。他明指方向却和實際上的方向相反，就是聲音發生這一方，而他指到那一方去。更許他的頭轉動，他便很正確地指着木板敲擊的地方。這情形阿慧當然是不相信，便呌阿明坐着，再來試騐，一些兒不錯，確有這樣的現象。</p>
<p>阿明便開口道：「我們當有一聲間發生時，不要先轉過頭，朝着聲音的方向，而是要向著聲音的相反方向去，便可測到聲音發生的確實方向，這也是養成我們遇事要鎮靜的習慣。」</p>

<p>— 德</p>
<p>著作者　（或編譯者）在未讀之先，翻文學辭典及文學史，以便曉得作者的生平，在文學史上的地位，及本劇在作者作品中的位置，產生年代或給予當時文壇的影響等，作一簡單的傳略。</p>
<p>劇情　戲劇並不僅是一個戲劇，但每篇故事總寄生在一個很好的故事裏。這故事是作者在整個人生中選擇出來的一個片段，能自起段落而說明他取用的「主題」的。所以我在讀全劇後，用自己的文字擇要地，把故事寫下來。</p>
<p>佈景劇體及劇性　佈景是戲劇呈獻給觀衆時的地點景物，如道具，背景，光錢等。劇體即戲劇之體材，如爲獨慕的或係四慕五幕的。劇性是包含在整個戲劇中的氣息，例如是幽默的，神秘的，恐怖的，或是快樂的，悲哀的。我是：前者用自已的話記述之，後兩者加以考察後，並略加斷語，如能說出本劇所屬派別更好。</p>
<p>動作　在劇本中，角色是少不了勒作的，這裏須加以研究和解釋，爲什麼要這樣？爲什麼不能不這樣？</p>
<p>頂點　頂點即　Climax，是戲劇進展中達到最緊張的地方。普通在結束處便是頂點，但很有例外；而且同劇中不止一個頂點的也有。不過其餘的頂點，也只是助長其主要項點之力而已。</p>
<p>人物　在這裏，我常把較主要的角色加以觀察，記出他的心理，思想，特性，人格等，尤其注意到那個人性格的變遷，思想的轉變等，且稍加批計。</p>
<p>對話　對話不僅能吿訴觀衆以戲劇的故事或劇情，並且還能表現人物的性格，傳達，思想，情感。我時常擇技巧優良的對話，抄寫幾句下；來，並說明牠的好處，這樣便能熟練自己，和人對話的技巧，同時便也是熟練自己寫劇本的技巧　（但是技巧優良小一定是好劇本）。</p>
<p>讀後感　最後寫出對於本劇的批評和感想，列論技巧，描寫思想等一切方面，儘不妨把各大作家各大批評家對於本劇的詊論，也抄叙進去，因爲那是可以幫助理解這本戲劇的。</p>
<p>最後以十二分的誠意，希望各位高明指敎史好的方法，我是抱着「拋磚引玉」的心來寫這篇東西的。</p>

<p>— 基</p>
<p>程硯秋氏所編的新戲，是四大名日中，最多而最具號召力的。如以前的「碧玉簪」一鴛鴦塚」「紅佛傳」「靑霜劍」等戲。無不予人以深刻印象。「銷麟囊」，是他皎近新編的一齣戲。</p>
<p>在未談到鎖麟囊乏前，我們先要對硯秋過去一切新戲有一種認識。要說的，就是他所編排的這些戲，在通俗而並非低級趣味。雖然他的戲比較容易受太太奶奶們的歡迎。然而這正是劇本的力量。在有深刻意識中而絕對的大衆化，但又絕無「私定終身」「公子落難」，這類俗不可奈的把戲。</p>
<p>「鎖麟囊」這劇戲，劇情富於情感。大意是說話一位千金小姐在無意中救了一個貧家女兒。並贈以原蓄珠寶之鎖麟囊貧家女兒，堅詢千金生氏以圖後報，而千金則以漂母飯信非為報也爲答，此女詢之再三，乃以銷麟囊贈之，以作紀念。數年後，洪水成災，千金小姐一家被水沖散，流落他鄉，有富戶，設粥廠，以濟貧民，千金因之乞粥，而粥廠主人憐之，留作保姆，在某種機緣下，做保姆之千金小姐，在主人家發現她贈人多年的鎖麟囊，而知道現在的卞母，就是以前她救過的那個貧家女兒。同時這富戶之家，正因爲恐怕恩人受洪水之災，日夜祈禱，大事施粥，爲恩人造幅，不期而遇，喜從望外，保姆乃一變而爲上賓，後來千金小姐也得一家骨肉重聚。這齣戲大致情節不過如此，但是牠的主要　，却在施善得福，受恩知報的慈善因果，在今日之下來講，應富說「這類劇本是需要的」。</p>
<p>最末值得介紹的，是硯秋在這齣戲裏，唱腔方面，有許多新的供獻，二六板中如哭頭，即其一也。這齣戲巳內定下週公演，演出的成績如何，容我觀後再作評斷。</p>

<p>— 伯敏</p>
<p>關於「木偶奇遇記」我搜得一些饒有趣味的鱗爪，足資一述。</p>
<p>「木偶奇遇記」一書是義大利人羅侖齊尼所著的童話，他的筆名叫柯洛第，原來柯洛第是羅侖齊尼童年時所居的村莊名，木偶名喚「畢諾丘」，它的意義是松木做的小孩」。</p>
<p>華爾德狄斯耐爲小木偶配音，會羅致了一百個男孩，在其中選出了狄基瓊司。</p>
<p>在柯洛第的童話裏，有一隻小蟋蟀做畢諾丘的「良心」警吿小木偶不可自招煩惱，華德狄斯耐最初想用一個白蟻來代替這小蟋蟀，因爲畢諾丘是個小木偶，最後却決定採用小蟋蟀，可是在這小東西的臉上畫出種種表情，極其困難。</p>
<p>華德狄斯耐在繪製本片時，雇用工作人員一千二百名，所用圖畫四十五萬張，塡墨，和着色部裏雇用女郎二百人，因爲女子做細巧工作，更有耐心，所以塡墨和着色工作，多讓這些女郎負責。</p>
<p>這部影片裏有許多音響，非常難配，例如海馬的鳴鳴聲，鯨魚的呼呼聲和被焚發怒時在海中翻騰聲，小木偶和小蟋蟀在水底談話聲，快樂和悲傷時的鐘擺的答聲，在繪製大鯨魚蒙斯屈洛時，曾用一條五呎長的馴良鯨魚當作模特兒，工作雖然困難，却都是很巧妙的成功了。</p>

<p>— 方企</p>
<p>外交居於從屬地位</p>
<p>日本報紙上有兩句形容阿部的地位的話道：「　派人使並不是和平的使節，大使的使命，在於呼應日軍作戰。」這兩句話　不僅可以形容阿部，並且也廣泛地描繪了日本　巳經歸到指揮刀下的外交。日本外交的和日本軍事呼應，由來巳久。可是被指揮者做應約工作固頗爲容易，而逢到要呼時，往往不免成爲變簧戲中被賣的啞角，不但他對作戰的形勢，不很叫瞭，指揮刀本身，也已不知道向什麼方向揮舞，於是往往有不知所云之苦。</p>
<p>國際政治上的機　主義</p>
<p>德蘇協定以前，日本常利用對蘇作戰的口號，以圖收多方面的利益。在有可利的時機中，也曾發動過兩次若有具事的對蘇作戰，以作試探。但因事實上只做到若有其事，外交上的呼應也就未能喊響。德蘇協定以後，終於只能用諾蒙漢停戰協定把對蘇約口號擱起，以待新的發展。這形勢下，作戰可以停頓的，而外交上的呼應，却仍得支持下去，於是對蘇就卑求接近，對英美却又自謂被蘇拉攏以施嚇詐，對意更希望巳死非命的反共公約會起還魂作用而仍在抱牢。三個表示中，如有一個是眞的，就正好證明另兩個全是假的。前兩項的有關方面，運探明牠的表示是眞假的意思也沒有，因而牠自己也沒有機會解釋，還有機會證明的似還推第三項。目前意大利的態度逐漸明顯起來，日本自然將趁此機會表示他的作戰計劃。可是意大利確是立在旣想反蘇又想反英的不安形勢下的，牠最近所能決定的，仍將不是在兩者之間，選定一面，那來牠還是不能爲日本決定一個選擇，而日本所能做的，就還只是等待。</p>
<p>對英國的嚇詐</p>
<p>自然很可能，日本會單純從意大利的反英表示方面，就決定也採取了反英的方向。但這所能引起的英國方面的反應也是很有限的。倘若英國認爲這能形成危險，牠當然寗願先對意大利讓步，以保全更珍貴的遠東，印度，而意大利也洛得先收穫一點嚇詐的效果，暫不訴諸武力。那末日本只留在原來的地位。至若英國幷不重視意大利的武力，牠就會自信到解決了地中海問題時，遠東仍不致發生重大變化。意大利海軍在地中海上的演習，英法都曾頗加注意，但日本海軍在中國海上的演習，英法尙似不暇顧問，這一點兒暗示，似也很够掃日本自視與意大利等重的豪興，那末日本對英的老手法，一時也小會突見成效。此外如英國縱顧和日本妥協，而日本究竟有多少可靠？英國如寬與日本妥協，美國的不快將使英國蒙如何的不利，還是暫時尙無需考廣的問題。</p>
<p>無法打開的日美間僵局</p>
<p>從英國方面說，美國態度雖是次要的問題，而從日本方面愚，美國的態度，倒是最先的問題。美國可以對芙國的親日，並不說認爲反美，但對日本的反英，却必然認爲就是反美，而日本如想得英國的妥協，却是非從反英的嚇詐開始不可的。日本如何才能迂迥地避免對美約嚇許，而進行對英約嚇詐，似乎是個未必尋得出的方法。在馬來西亞問題上，美國巳先發出信號，並使指揮刀指揮了個類似道歉的聲明了，縱使日本直接以新加坡爲目標，也米必就能使美國認爲與他無關吧？日本的提出馬來西亞問題時，除威被英國以外，原　想表示勾結德國的，但德國對這毫無表示，這　只是消極的一面，倒並不是日本外交上最輕的碰　。</p>
<h3 id="c107">外人眼中的　日本經濟困難 <a href="#c107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>— 綠譯</p>
<p>關於日本的經濟困難，近來外報頗多揭載。現在基本問題之一是煤與電力的不足。</p>
<p>遠東調查雜誌在論日本經濟狀况一文中，這樣說：</p>
<p>煤的缺乏　一許多專家早巳指出，賤價燃煤的缺乏是發展日本重工業的主要障碍之一。雖然樣，但是日本領袖們却着手編製重工業自給自足的野心計　……</p>
<p>「自一九三七年八月以來，關於日本及其屬地的採煤統計被宣佈爲國家的秘密。但三菱公司的研究局確定，一九三九年上半年的採煤額减少百分之十五以上。」</p>
<p>採煤額减少的原因，據該雜誌解釋，是因爲熟練工人不够，勞動生產力降低，價值昂貴的礦機的相當不足。</p>
<p>燃煤的缺乏，因水電廠製電的减少，特別感覺尖銳。這雜誌又說：</p>
<p>食　缺乏　關於日本食物供給的問題，今年也很矢銳，在最近一期的密勒氏評論報上登載一篇非常有趣的文章。據稱：</p>
<p>「中日開戰以來第一次，一般的說，許多年來第一次日本帝國的食物供給處在威脅之下。許多月來，日本及其殖民地感受食物的缺乏。在新收穫之前，這些困難還要愈益尖銳化。食物的自給本來是建基於日本財政經濟軍事的計算上，因此日本的人民一直沒有直接感覺中日戰事對於日本經濟的嚴重的影響。現在巳不能自給了，日本不能冉保障食物的自給自足了。一九三九—四〇年的農村經濟年是日本最壞的一年。日本，朝鮮和台灣的收穫都因天氣不良而大受損害。此外，尙　像農村人手不够，農具不足，人造肥料缺乏等這些戰爭的後果，都使農民的狀况惡化」。</p>
<p>結果，日本不得小限制許多種物品的消費，輸入大量穀物，限制許多貨物出口。</p>
<p>平時，日本是由朝鮮輸入食米以袖不足的，今年朝鮮的收穫也很不好。據稱：</p>
<p>「日本不足的米至少達一百二十萬噸，這須要從國外輸人。最近日本曾在曼谷，村貢和西貢定購大批食米，但是很雖找到商輪把米運到日本去。對於日人最不快的，是輸入的米要付外幣現款。食米的不足威脅着日本外幣準備令的耗盡」。</p>
<p>過去一年，日本非特食米收成不好，而目其他幾種重要的穀物，如小麥和大麥也收成不好。可見日本在新收穫之前要經歷非常困難的時期。</p>
<p>外國觀察家把日本最近在華的失利和經濟關係連繫起來，軍車進攻的失敗。美國國民週報社論，論中日戰况和前途，歷數日人的失敗：粤北的敗衂，進攻長沙的失敗，屢攻企圖切斷中越軍需綫，總無結果，它說：</p>
<p>「這些事實是表明日本不能組織嚴重的進攻徬徨於中國大地的日軍不能給華軍嚴重的打擊。日本國內缺乏燃煤和電力，再加上入口原料的缺乏，很嚴重的推翻了以前作日軍勝利基礎的物質的優越」。</p>
<p>據國民周報說，日人表示，不打算繼續向前推進。日人五度企圖進攻，但每次都慘遭失敗。</p>
<p>國民周報總結它對於中國局勢的分析說：「在這一方或那一方沒有完全精疲力盡之前，戰爭將一直繼續着。」</p>

<p>日本現首相米內光政原爲一「無性格者，他會在林，近衛，平沼三內閣中連任海相，並無政治的性格，僅爲一平平常常無大過失約海相而巳。所以常受政界各方面之始終好感者，並非因爲他能發揮超然的政治手腕，而是極可笑的始終抱長者之風，一切聽從他　時的次官山本的意見所致。山本現爲日本聯台艦隊司令長官，當米內任海相時代，米內山木的聯合搭擋一直沒有拆開過。譬如平沼內閣時之對歐政策協議方面，米內能抱屹然態度者，也是山本在背後發揮辣腕的緣故。米內任海相之政繁實質上完全由於山本活躍操縱的結果。如今，讓米內獨自担當這目前重任，前途如何，自屬疑問。固然米內係由海軍大將地位出任內閣，海軍方面自然是全面的支持。但米內內閣之前途依舊是絲毫不可樂觀。其他一切都不用講，單就陸軍勢力是否能被吸收於內閣之下，這一點便完全決定了米內政治的方向了。老實說，米內內閣在這一次政變道程中出現，只可看做是日本政治走向軍人內閣的一個過渡內閣吧了。</p>

<p>— 守中</p>
<p>凡人不能獨立生活，必須相聚而處，分工合作，互相扶助，故人類之生活爲社會生活，人類生活之組織，爲社會文化日進，社會發達組織益加嚴密者爲國家，依國家權力以强行社會生活之規範爲法律，故入之生存，除衣食住外，法律乃必要之條件，人類愈進化，規範益嚴緊，法律更周密，人之相依法律以生存之程度亦愈切，我國政制向爲人治，民不知有法，惟統治者之命令是從，自民國肇始，政體變革，漸入法治之階梯，祇以歷年來內亂頻仍，政治未能納入常規，而人民智識父極淺薄，一般生活簡單，其能瞭解法律與人類之關係者，實至寥寥，在此情形之下，政府果不易行使其權力，人民則失其保障，狡黠之徒乘機玩法，侵凌無智，儘有極周詳之法律，其與無法何異</p>
<p>商標與營　信譽</p>
<p>茲姑以商標法一項論之，查商標爲商品之標識，蓋以商品種類繁多，每有同一類之商品而多至千百種者，孰優孰劣，孰貴孰賤，購者無從辨識，必須採用獨特之標記，標明其出品，使購者知所選擇，商人以謀利爲目的，欲求此項目的之實現，必須樹立信譽，推進業務，而信譽之建立，除改良技術推廣市塲擴充資力外，商標之爲力尤鉅。</p>
<p>商標專用權之取得</p>
<p>因商品種類之多，區別之難，已如前述，商品之眞眞名稱，每爲人所遺忘，或爲人所不能認識者，乃即以商標名稱爲品名，商標旣巳爲人所熟稔矣，更必使其勿焉人所冒製，防止冒襲之方法，惟有依照商標法所付予之權利，請求政府爲之註册，是爲商標專用權之取得，苟有意圖襲用者，儘可訴之法院，治之以罪</p>
<p>依法註册不虞侵犯</p>
<p>我國工業，以人才之缺乏，財力之不足，雖有數十年歷史，進步至爲遲緩，其巳具有相常規模者，輒受外商之壓迫，或恃其雄厚之資力，或賴其特殊之利權，千方白計，無微不至，商標一端之細，亦不爲若輩所忽視，測其用心，無非破壞摧殘壟斷把持，國貨商標旣經政府之核准註册，彼必曲解條文，設詞强辯，或竟危言恫嚇，無端興訟，國人以法律知識之缺乏，苟遇上述情事，每致惶惑徬徨，束手無策，其結果或明知委曲而不敢爭辯，或莫明究竟而誤爲理之至當，殊不知金錢之損失果屬有限，其因自己商標之必須　棄變更，以致信譽上業務上遭受之損失，實屬小貲，而其影響於整個國貨界者尤鉅，凡國貨界中人，豈可不加注意歟</p>
<p>研究參考唯一刊物</p>
<p>法律爲專門科學，非一般商人所能易於瞭解，市上雖有關於商標法之書籍，大多爲闡釋原理者，閱時旣覺枯燥無味，閱後亦不能體會其眞諦，無補於實用，茲聞近有本市國貨界聞人許冠羣君，與前在商標局爲審查員之李寰平君，合作編著商標法之理論與實際一書，記者曾窺其大概，將商標法之立法意義與運用方法，詳細透露，引徵廣博，詮釋確當，關於辦理商標註冊之各項程序與異議，訴願之處置，尤爲經騐之結晶，蓋許君以其所絆營之事業，對於商標事件常多爭議，而李君服務商標局歷十餘年，以兩君經騐之宏富，宜具所著之精闢矣，我國貨界中人，尤宜人手一冊，爲參考之典籍。</p>
<h3 id="c112">一則以喜一則以懼的現象 <a href="#c112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>— 白羽</p>
<p>最近遇到一位經營出口生意的朋友，談到現在我國的出口貨物，一天一天的多起來，從前出口貨的大宗是原料品，現在除原料品外，工業品也不少。不僅南洋各地歡迎中國貨前往推銷，即使美國各州也歡迎中國貨。南洋僑胞歡迎中國貨，完全是受愛國心的驅使，而美國各州的歡迎中國貨，却完全是爲了價廉。法幣的跌價，外匯的緊縮，却刺激了國貨在海外市塲上的發展，所以近來如熱水瓶，調味粉，草地毯一類的國貨，運銷美國去的很多。我聽了這位朋友的話，發生了一則以喜一則以懼的心理。喜的甚麼，喜的是國貨的市塲日漸擴大：懼的甚麼？懼的是這一個機會，是中國工商業在海外發展的一個好機會，這樣一個千載難逢的機會，如果能好好的利用牠，則此後中國貨在世界的市塲上，也可以佔得一席地；如果不好好的利用，失却了海外顧客的信仰，此後冉要想開闢海外的市塲，那就不容易了。我們知道這决外人之喜用中國貨，雖然中國貨年來不乏進步，而匯率的緊縮，未始非重要原因之一。即以熱水瓶而論，普通二磅熱水瓶在中國布塲上售價一元餘，如以美金換算，祇值美金一角，中國熱水瓶在美售美金二三角，較之美貨低廉數倍，運鉗者即使加上關稅水脚，依然大有贏餘。因此中國貨在海外市塲遂甚受顧客的歡迎。旣然有了這一個好機會，我們更應乘此時機，將各種國貨出品，精益求精，愼選原料，改良品質，考究裝璜，不應以能超越本國同類出品爲滿足，而應以能與優良外貨平肩相等爲準繩；不應以廉價推銷爲得計，而應以品質優良獲得海外顧客信任爲目標，利用此種時機，奠定國貨在海外市塲之基礎。即使將來世界秩序恢復，匯率趨於正常，國貨在海外之信用已立，營業亦不患沒有把握了。我聽了這位朋友的說話後，雖然是喜懼交併，我國貨界同人苟能看準目標，勇猛邁進，不以一時的近利爲滿足，努力從事國產品質的改進，我想喜的成分大於懼的成分的。</p>

<p>— 黃警頑</p>
<p>自立工藝社，係休履彬君所創辦。林君福建閩侯人，前充商務邱書館理化部編譯員，對於工業，頗有研究，善以小資本經營工業。該社規模不大，僅佔屋數問，男女工人約三十餘人，而設備則頗完備。如蒸汽爐，電動機以及主要之機器頗多。最近所製之擦字橡皮，極受國內外同胞之歡迎，蓋因中國抗戰及歐戰之影響，舶來之擦字橡皮，甚形缺乏，且該社所製之貨，堪與上等之舶來品並駕齊驅，而售價尤廉，故南洋羣島，如星加坡，菲利賓，暹羅…等處，爭相定購，遂佔德國貨原有之市塲。</p>
<p>細考該社製造擦字橡皮之原料，係用橡膠炭酸鈣，玻璃粉，油，石灰等原料，用機器調合之後，在高汽壓之密閉器中，用蒸汽烘焙，與別種橡膠製品之製法，大同小異。由生料以至於成品裝盒，須經十餘段之工作。</p>
<p>據調查過去中國自製擦字橡皮者，在民國二十四年之前，有陳嘉庚公司及某橡膠廠，兩家出品，均以銷路有限，早巳停止出貨，故該社所製造之擦字橡皮，尚屬中國獨家製造</p>
<p>該社出品之擦字橡皮，已出有三種牌子，（一）A字牌係紅色價最廉，（二）自立脾係淡紅色，性質比A字牌爲佳，（三）萬里快牌係白色性質與自立　相近，特因採用德國白色，外觀較美，而成本較昂，故售價亦貴</p>
<h3 id="c116">張裕釀酒公司的全貌 <a href="#c116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>— 樂天齋夫</p>
<p>張裕葡萄酒　白地，年來銷數激增，大有與洋酒爭一日之短長的模樣，高尙家庭或交際塲中，無論宴客送禮，都認爲它是高雅的物品，國貨有此榮譽，殊屬難得。茲就「張裕」的現狀，摭述一二，以饗本刊讀者</p>
<p>「張裕」過云與現在</p>
<p>遜淸同治十年，張裕的創辦人張弼士先生，經商於荷屬東印度，他是一位滿腹經綸的商人，在僑界有優越的地位。有一六應法領事之宴，席間痛飲葡萄酒與白蘭地，無意中談起酒話來；法領說貴國的烟台，最適宜於栽植葡萄，釀成酒，比這酒　好。寥寥數語，張先生却記在心頭。光緒十年，他回國並親到烟台調查，果然證實了法領的話。翌年便斥資三百萬元，擇地建築工廠酒窖，又購東西南山地數千畝，栽植歐美名貴葡萄數百萬小，苦心經營，喊二十載而組具規模。因事屬初創，無可取法，在歐美固然有不少葡萄酒廠，在遠東，尤其在中國，找不出第二家葡萄酒廠來。所以釀造師必須請敎歐美人，二十年之中，曾換了三位酒師，工廠數次改建，葡萄也經十餘决之改種。張先生曾說過半生精力，盡瘁酒業，可見創業的艱難了。近幾年來，張先生對出品精益求精，添騁意大利釀造專家巴狄士多奇爲酒師，製釀達上有六種，行銷中外，甘美芳冽，深輿論贊計，將見國酒暢銷，利權可逐漸挽回了</p>
<p>「張裕」美酒的品質</p>
<p>把成熟葡萄壓碎醱酵後，裝入地窖酒桶，儲藏五六年，經許多精密管理後，少能感爲葡萄酒。再把葡萄酒蒸溜後，儲於橡質木桶中十餘年多至數十年，始能成爲上等白蘭地。像張裕的四十年金獎白蘭地，便是一例。葡萄的品種有百餘，所以釀成的酒也各有區別，大致又分作紅，白，乾，甜，起泡，靜止，等六類葡萄酒。張裕的美酒，因爲是純葡萄汁釀成，故於人身有着種種利益。據國醫專家李時珍先生說：葡萄酒主治煖腰腎，駐顏色，耐飢寒，補血益氣，常飲可使人壯健活潑，延年益壽。近代東西洋各國人士，莫不以葡萄酒爲袖血養生的神品。白蘭地可疏散風寒，兼治嘔吐，痧氣，暢筋，活血，舒肺，化痰，餐後少飲，大助消化之力。宜乎西洋人無不愛飲，行銷能廣而且貴。國人近年亦追踪提倡，漸有家喻戶曉趨勢</p>
<p>釀造前途的展望</p>
<p>過去數十年來，舶來洋酒在中國市塲上，可說到處暢銷，在一般富麗的人，宴會嘉賓時，好像非洋酒不足以示豪闊，第年在海關冊的入超上，也算一筆鉅大的漏　。自從「七七」抗戰之後，國人愛用國貸的心理，比較熱烈，兼之外匯暴縮，洋酒一瓶的價值，每在三四十元以上，而品質同樣的「張裕」美酒，最高每瓶不過七八元，自然大家趨向又改變了。以上海而言，往年歲銷三千箱的，現在却增加了十倍以上，尤其南洋羣島的華僑，提倡得格外努力，西南各省市塲，也漸漸擴大需要量，預料大局開展後，必有供不應求之勢。「張裕」本身所產的原料，鮮葡萄，每年有五十萬擔，現擬設法收買烟台附近民間所產的葡萄，（佔計與張裕所產額相仿）大量釀造，以求供應的適合。釀造在中國民族工業史上，自始只有「張裕」一家，（手製的土酒除外）它巳具五十年的歷史，僅不過站定了基礎，將來的發展，當然是很可以樂觀的。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Great Victories on the Borders of Shanxi and Henan: Chinese Armies Attack the Remnants of the Japanese Forces from the South and North, Encircling Them in the Jincheng and Bo'ai Areas; Chinese Forces Fiercely Attack Key Points on Both Sides of the Daoqing Railway <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Yangcheng: The Japanese troops in Yangcheng, Fushan, and Yicheng, since the 20th, mustered over ten thousand troops, advancing in several directions towards the eastern and western areas of Qinshui City, attempting to invade Yuanqu and occupy the west bank area of Qinshui. After being met by the Chinese army in Zhangmazhen, Zhongcunzhen, Xingyu (all southwest of Qinshui), Meigou (northwest of Qinshui), and the opposite bank of Zhengzhuang (east of Qinshui), fierce battles broke out. The Chinese army divided the invading Japanese into several sections. Two groups of Japanese troops rushing from Yicheng to reinforce were intercepted by the Chinese forces in Shangge Village, Lijiapo, Sungou, and Wayaogou, all located on the southeast side of Yicheng. As of the 24th, of the Japanese who fled from Fushan and Yicheng, only about two thousand infantry and artillery remained, retreating southward. On the same day, they were fiercely attacked by the Chinese army in the Foye Temple area of Liucunzhen (both northwest of Yangcheng), and the Japanese retreated towards Yangcheng. The victorious Chinese armies then fiercely attacked Yangcheng, completely recovering it by the evening of the 25th. The Japanese army fled towards Zhoucun (east of Yangcheng), and the Chinese army is currently pursuing them fiercely. Furthermore, close contact has been established with the various armies advancing south from Lingchuan and Gaoping, and north from Jiyuan and Qinyang, tightly encircling the Bo'ai and Jincheng areas, aiming to annihilate the stubborn Japanese forces. (Telegraph from the 27th)</p>
<p>Lingchuan: Since the 20th, the Japanese army in southern Shanxi has launched an all-out invasion southward. Various routes of escape from Changzhi, Changzi, and Huguan, totaling about twenty thousand troops, are attempting to occupy the area east of Qinshui in order to open up transportation between the Baijin Highway and the Daoqing Railway. The Japanese troops advancing along the Baijin Highway and on both sides of it towards Gaoping were intercepted by the Chinese army in the vicinity of Sanjiacun, Sizhuangzhen, and Yechuanzhen, north of Gaoping, and were fiercely attacked from both sides with the main force. After a bloody battle until the evening of the 23rd, all the Japanese were annihilated by the Chinese forces. The Japanese troops that came to reinforce were also defeated by the Chinese army. Unable to return to their nests via the original route, the remnants scattered into the mountainous areas northwest of Gaoping. The Chinese army then separately searched and eliminated them. By the 25th, all the remaining Japanese north of Gaoping had been completely cleared. The Chinese army continued to advance, turning east to closely link up with the Chinese army in the northeast of Lingchuan, and launched a fierce attack on all sides against the Japanese who had infiltrated Lingchuan on the night of the 22nd. After half a day of bloody fighting, the Japanese were completely annihilated, and Lingchuan was immediately recaptured. This resulted in the Japanese forces fleeing from Lingchuan to Jincheng on the 23rd having their rear completely cut off by the Chinese forces in Lingchuan and Gaoping. The Chinese army then tracked them down from both sides of Gaoping and various parts of Lingchuan to Jincheng. On the afternoon of the 26th, countless Japanese military supplies and horses were seized along the way, and the main force advanced fiercely along the major roads from Lingchuan to Huojia, passing through both sides of Guitao Mountain (south of Lingchuan), and the major roads from Lingchuan to Xiuwu, towards key points on the Daoqing Railway. (Telegraph from the 27th)</p>
<p>Luoyang: The Japanese troops along the Daoqing Railway in northern Henan, east of Xinxiang, have mostly been transferred to Kaifeng for reinforcement. The Chinese army on both sides of this section of the railway, in order to coordinate with the operations in the suburbs of Kaifeng, has begun to fiercely attack various key points along this section, making smooth progress. The Japanese troops in Bo'ai, at both ends of the Daoqing Railway, have been rushing to rescue the remnants of the Japanese forces besieged in southeastern Shanxi, and have been invading the Tianjingguan area southwest of Jincheng for several days. The Chinese army on the north bank of the Yellow River, in coordination with the Chinese army advancing south from Linxian and Lingchuan, has launched a large-scale operation from Jiyuan, Mengxian, Wenxian, Qinyang, and Wuzhi, crossing the Qinshui River in droves, completing a large encirclement, and launching an attack on the western section of the Daoqing Railway. Another route has advanced to the vicinity of Tianjingguan, intercepting the Japanese forces invading from the north and south, and fierce fighting is currently underway. (Telegraph from the 27th)</p>
<p>Luoyang: A group of Japanese troops invading south from Zhangdian in southern Shanxi was repelled by the Chinese army near Luyan Village. The remnants fled to the Wangjiagou and Liujiacun areas (both southeast of Zhangdian). On the 24th, they received reinforcements of over three thousand troops and launched a counterattack against the Chinese army in several directions. One group engaged in a bloody battle with the Chinese army near Xiaopoling. The Chinese army intercepted and killed them from multiple directions, inflicting countless casualties. Another route fiercely attacked the Nangou area (southwest of Maojia Mountain), where the Chinese army killed over six hundred and eighty Japanese troops. Fierce fighting continued until late at night. (The 27th)</p>
<p>Xi'an: The Japanese troops in Baiyaitou, Datou (southeast of Zhangdian), and other places in southern Shanxi have been fiercely attacked by the Chinese army from multiple directions for several days, suffering heavy casualties. On the afternoon of the 24th, the Chinese army again used strong forces to encircle Wangzhuang and charged at the Japanese troops, killing over five hundred and forty Japanese by the evening. The Japanese were unable to withstand the attack and fled. (Telegraph from the 27th)</p>
<p>Luoyang: In the battlefield of southern Shanxi, where bloody battles have been raging for ten days, the Chinese armies have killed and wounded over five thousand Japanese soldiers. They are now being divided into several sections by the Chinese army and annihilated section by section. On the evening of the 24th, the Japanese attempted to break through the encirclement in all directions, with the area near Yandi (northeast of Maojin) as the center. The Chinese army intercepted them layer by layer. After a day and night of fierce fighting, the Japanese suffered over a thousand more casualties. Especially in the battle in the suburbs of Wangyuan Village, east of Yandi, the Japanese released a large amount of smoke to harass the Chinese army. The Chinese army divided and converged to encircle them, and over a thousand Japanese soldiers were completely wiped out by the Chinese army. In recent days, many of the Japanese transportation lines have been cut off by the Chinese army.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Japanese Troops Retreat Northwest of Changxing <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Ningguo: The Japanese troops in Changxing, Jiannan, gathered over a thousand troops on the afternoon of the 25th and invaded Sianzhen (west of Changxing). They were fiercely attacked by the Chinese army in the vicinity of Lincheng Bridge and Dayun Temple (west of Changxing), resulting in over four hundred and sixty Japanese casualties. The remnants fled in defeat towards Changxing. (Telegraph from the 27th)</p>
<p>Guilin: Over a thousand Japanese troops near Hexi, northwest of Changxing, were defeated by the Chinese army on the afternoon of the 25th and retreated towards Changxing. (Telegraph from the 26th) Many Japanese troops were killed while reinforcing Licun in Xiangling from Linfen. (Telegraph from the 26th)</p>
<p>Xingji: There are no more traces of the Japanese troops in the area around Guocun, Yumiao, and Dongxiyancun in southern Shanxi. The Chinese army is encircling and attacking the Japanese at Dakuanling Bridge. Another strong force is intercepting the fleeing Japanese in the area around Huaishuxia, Jiajialin, Zhongcun, and Jushizhuang. For several days, over two thousand wounded officers and soldiers have been transported back to Anxiang from Zhangmao Avenue by the Japanese. (Telegraph from the 26th)</p>
<p>Luoyang: A unit of the Japanese army that invaded east from Fuxingbo (east of Qinshui) was surrounded by the Chinese army in Xianjun. There are rumors of a possible civil war in the Chinese army. The telegram rebukes those who advocate an anti-communist policy and states that the communist army leaders will spare no effort to promote national unity and eliminate friction. They oppose civil war and will continue the war of resistance under the leadership of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. The telegram is signed by General Zhu De, Commander of the Eighteenth Group Army (the new name after the expansion of the Eighth Route Army), followed by Peng Dehuai, Deputy Commander of the Army, Ye Ting, Commander of the New Fourth Army, and Xiang Ying, Deputy Commander, among others. (Reuters telegraph from the 27th) After two and a half years of preliminary investigation by the Tokyo District Court, it has been decided to transfer the case to the criminal court for public trial in the near future. The Japanese government dissolved the Japan Labor Union and the Japan People's Party, two left-wing organizations, in December of that year, and their leaders were also arrested. The People's Front was originally established in 1934. After the China Incident occurred, although they did not dare to engage in open activities, they still engaged in anti-war propaganda. Kato Kanji, a member of the House of Representatives, was also among those arrested. (Telegraph from the 27th)</p>
<p>All Japanese forces are being surrounded and annihilated separately. (Telegraph from the 27th)</p>
<p>Shangrao: The Japanese troops in Wuhu and Wanzhi are invading south in separate routes. After being met by the Chinese army, fierce battles have been unfolding since the 25th in the vicinity of Nanling and Fanchang. The Chinese army is fighting bravely, charging back and forth, and engaging in bloody battles until the night of the 26th, resulting in countless Japanese casualties. The Chinese army has also sent a large force around the rear of the Japanese and advanced directly towards Wuhu. They have now advanced to the southeast and southwest of Wuhu, cutting off the rear of the fleeing Japanese. The Japanese invasion by land was intercepted by the Chinese army, and a fierce battle unfolded near Youhuaishuxia. After a fierce battle until late at night, over two hundred and thirty Japanese troops were killed or wounded. The Japanese were unable to withstand the attack and fled. (Telegraph from the 25th)</p>

<h3 id="e5">The Plight of Japanese Diplomacy <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Although Japan's aggression against China is unanimously condemned by the international community, its diplomatic activities in the international arena have never slackened. For example, recently: (1) Kawai, a special envoy of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, arrived in London on the 8th of this month after touring North and South American countries, and will travel to the European continent to visit France, Germany, Belgium, and the Netherlands. (2) Another special envoy, Ito, also left Tokyo on the 12th of this month, traveling through Siberia to Europe for activities. (3) The Japanese ambassador to the Soviet Union, Togo, held talks with Mikoyan, the Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Trade, on the 19th of this month. Afterwards, Japanese newspapers released information stating that the Soviet government was willing to form an agreement with Japan at any cost, so that it could freely operate in Southeast Europe. However, the Soviet official news agency was immediately instructed to deny this. (4) Tokyo also publicized that Britain had proposed to Japan to conclude a new Anglo-Japanese. Later, it was also denied by Britain. In addition, (5) Japanese newspapers and magazines have been discussing particularly vigorously recently how to break the diplomatic deadlock. Japan has always exercised extremely strict control over speech, especially during wartime. Newspapers and magazines are not easy to speak freely, so talking about diplomacy and venting their dissatisfaction with political elbows is indeed a fact. However, the Japanese government and the public are deeply distressed by the setbacks in the war of aggression against China, so they want to find a way out through diplomacy, which is expressed unanimously from top to bottom.</p>
<p>However, this way out is not only difficult to open up, but simply impossible to open up. It is not difficult to understand by analyzing the objective situation. The main players on the Far Eastern international stage, besides China and Japan, are Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. The main players on the world international stage, besides Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, are France, Germany, and Italy. If Japan wants to find a way out in diplomacy, its main targets are naturally the six countries of Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, France, Germany, and Italy. These six countries have their own urgencies and their own secrets, but if we analyze them in terms of the Far East issue, Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France are a group, whose interests lie in maintaining China's independence, integrity, and the open door policy, and protecting their material and spiritual rights and interests in China. Germany and Italy are another group. They have fewer rights and interests in the Far East and have less significant relationships, but they are shouting in Europe to break the status quo. Japan's goal is to overturn the Far Eastern status quo and dominate China. Its natural trend is to unite with Germany and Italy to resist Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France. Therefore, from the Hirota Cabinet to the Hayashi Cabinet, the Konoe Cabinet, and even the Hiranuma Cabinet, its diplomatic direction has followed the Germany and Italy line, touting the name of the anti-communist agreement and implementing its separate aggression. However, this situation underwent a major change in August of last year. The signing of the German-Soviet Pact completely destroyed the defensive money of the anti-communist agreement. At that time, Japan had gone through more than two years of war of aggression against China, its national strength was declining, and it was difficult to sustain. It was in need of foreign aid, while Germany was stirring up war in Europe and could not take care of itself. Italy was the poorest of the great powers, and of course, it had no surplus power to assist Japan, which was mired in a quagmire. Therefore, Japan went from disappointment to despair towards Germany and Italy.</p>
<p>Since Japan was disappointed and despaired of Germany and Italy, it had to change its diplomatic line. Therefore, after Abe came to power last autumn, he personally served as the Minister of Foreign Affairs and announced his diplomatic policy as "returning to a blank sheet of paper." The so-called "returning to a blank sheet of paper" was actually flirting with Britain and the United States, and especially unilaterally favoring the United States. At this time, the United States had just announced the abandonment of the US-Japan Commercial Treaty, and the US-Japan Commercial Treaty had not actually expired. Japan wanted to use diplomatic means to lure the United States and rekindle old flames, because of its internal political necessity to appease the people, the international necessity of attempting to blockade China, and the economic necessity of heavily relying on the United States for military supplies and foreign trade. Therefore, Nomura, known as the "American expert," succeeded as Minister of Foreign Affairs, but nothing was achieved during the term of the Abe Cabinet. In mid-January of this year, Minai came to power for only ten days, and the US-Japan relationship finally entered a non-treaty state. Moreover, since then, the United States has intensified its pressure with every step Japan takes. For example, after Japan reorganized Nanjing on March 30 and after Japanese Foreign Minister Arita made a statement on the Dutch East Indies issue on the 15th of this month, US Secretary of State Hull solemnly explained the uncompromising attitude of the United States. Even without General Dodgey's speech and the US government's strengthening of the moral embargo against Japan, anyone could understand that a compromise between the US and Japan was impossible. Therefore, Japan shifted its seduction targets to the Soviet Union and Britain, but both Britain and the Soviet Union immediately issued statements that they had no intention of showing a compromise agreement to Japan.</p>
<p>Combining the current international situation in the Far East, Germany and Italy have no surplus to assist Japan. Britain has considerable surplus power, and the United States and the Soviet Union have sufficient surplus power, but they do not assist Japan. Instead, they all stand in clear opposition to Japan. When the Sino-Japanese War first broke out, Japan relied on its strong military power and thought that it could conquer China in a short period of time, and that as long as it placed the accomplished fact of conquering China before all countries, all countries would have no choice. Therefore, it rushed headlong without regard for diplomacy. To be honest, if China did not resist and surrendered, like Czechoslovakia and Denmark; if China resisted and was defeated, like Abyssinia and Albania; if China abandoned the war of resistance halfway, like Finland; then Japan would have been complacent, and all countries would have had no choice but to lament. Japan did not expect the factual lessons it encountered to be a long-term war of resistance and a strong war of resistance, which made it unable to ignore the outside world. Furthermore, because of the deep quagmire of the war of aggression against China, it could only think of finding a way out in diplomacy to alleviate its military poverty, but it was not available. It is Japan's own blind aggression and disregard for objective circumstances that have created the current diplomatic predicament for Japan. Originally, the Soviet Union had vast territories in the Far East. Britain had few territories in the Far East but particularly broad rights and interests. As for the United States, its founding life is entrusted to the Pacific Ocean. France is an ally of Britain, with the same situation and shared interests. Therefore, as long as Japan does not abandon its policy of aggression against the Asian continent and the Pacific Ocean, the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain, and France will not be able to sleep peacefully, and they will not be able to compromise with Japan. Such a major crisis of diplomatic isolation is something that Japan cannot afford. Laying down the butcher knife can lead to immediate enlightenment, and untying the bell only requires a single thought. However, today's Japan is not enough to speak of this.</p>

<p>Washington: As the commanders of the US fleet were discussing defense issues in Pearl Harbor, Acting Secretary of the Navy Compton announced that twenty more naval vessel commanders would be reassigned this summer and early autumn. This type of reassignment is a routine procedure. Six admirals will reach the age limit of sixty-four this summer. Meanwhile, non-official sources claimed that the issues of the Dutch East Indies and Japan were at least one of the main issues in the fleet problem discussions held in Honolulu. The war in Europe was also a matter of particular attention. Furthermore, the effectiveness of submarine attacks on cruisers and other warships, the effectiveness of aerial reconnaissance of submarines, and the speed and effectiveness of mine-laying and mine-sweeping vessels were also important topics in the fleet conference. Non-official sources also pointed out that the issues of concern to the US Navy and the British Navy were actually the same, as both the UK and the US rely on maritime power as their first line of defense and must maintain the length of their maritime transport. Moreover, naval circles said that no unexpected incidents have been reported regarding the current Pacific naval exercises, and the exercises of the warships have been very successful.

<h3 id="e22">Germany Accuses Britain and France of Intending to Expand the Scope of the European War; Ribbentrop Yesterday Released Diplomatic Documents Proving That British Troops Landing in Norway Was Premeditated; London Official Communiqué Strongly Rejects It As False <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>Berlin: German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop today gave a speech to diplomats and journalists in Berlin, detailing how the German army preemptively and timely entered Norway in order to prevent and disrupt the Allied forces' sudden landing plan in Norway. He stated that the British army laying mines in Norwegian territorial waters on April 8 was merely a preparation for the landing of the British expeditionary force, which was already ready to depart. "We received reports that the Allied expeditionary forces embarking on ships would land at Bergen, Trondheim, and Stavanger on April 9." Mr. Ribbentrop also presented a white paper containing various documents, listing the "Details of British plans to implement actions in Norway before the German army entered Norway," to those in attendance. It is said that these documents were seized by the German army after the first engagement between the German army and the British army in Lillehammer on April 22. The German official news agency announced the release of these documents at almost the same time as the beginning of Mr. Ribbentrop's speech.</p>
<p>Ribbentrop claimed that since British Sea Lord Churchill's speech several weeks ago, the remarks made by British and French politicians have all contained requests for neutral countries to join the war against Germany. Mr. Ribbentrop also listed the speeches of British politicians such as Prime Minister Chamberlain, Sea Lord Churchill, Foreign Secretary Halifax, Minister of Engineering, and Cooper to prove his point. Mr. Ribbentrop then mentioned Finland, saying that the British and French claims that Norway and Sweden would allow their troops to pass through in order to assist Finland were completely untrue. It is said that the German government learned that the Finnish ambassador to France reported to his own government on March 12 that Daladier and Churchill had made firm assurances to Finland after the request was made that British and French troops would immediately depart from the port where they were ready to depart, in order to land in Norway. The two countries of Norway and Sweden would only be notified of the troops passing through with a note, and would not request the permission of the two governments. On March 11, Mr. Churchill flew to Paris to make a final effort to obstruct the peace between Finland and the Soviet Union. The documents seized by the German army in Norway further prove the British and French plot to expand the war to Northern Europe. According to the documents obtained in Narvik, it was proven that British spies along the Norwegian west coast studied good strategies for landing. Although the Norwegian government secretly sympathized with the Allied plans at the time, these spies still operated as usual. Mr. Ribbentrop also said that Mr. Churchill inadvertently revealed Britain's true purpose when hosting neutral reporters. At that time, Mr. Churchill vehemently criticized the three countries of Norway, Sweden, and Denmark, saying that it was necessary to prevent iron ore from being transported to Germany. The German government was very satisfied with the information obtained from various sources regarding Sweden's attempts to consider its neutral position and its failure to violate neutrality. On the other hand, the German government has obtained documents proving that the Norwegian government not only agreed to the Allied plan to expand the war, but also actively supported the actions proposed by the Western powers. According to the information recently discovered in Norway, it can be seen that the British espionage system in Norway has the full support of the Norwegian government. We had earlier obtained evidence that the Norwegian government had decided to join the Allied side in joint operations. When the Norwegian government held a meeting on March 2, its Prime Minister and Foreign Minister both made remarks on this. In addition to the above-mentioned documents, there are many other actions of the Allies in neutral countries, such as the sabotage activities of spies in the Balkans, which can prove their intention to spread the war as much as possible.</p>
<p>Later, the German government learned of French Prime Minister Reynaud's non-public conversation with neutral diplomats on the 30th of the third month, and the intention of the Allies became more obvious. In this conversation, Mr. Reynaud carelessly declared that the West was no longer in danger. In the days that followed, the Western powers would take resolute action in Northern Europe. Therefore, the head of state ordered the German navy to set sail. The Allied forces laying mines on April 8 was merely a preparation for the British expeditionary force to land. We received intelligence that on April 9, the Allied forces had embarked and departed, preparing to land at Bergen, Trondheim, and Stavanger, but on the morning of the 9th, Germany's counter-action had been implemented, timely preventing and disrupting the attempt to land in Norway. After the British Admiralty knew of the German Navy's actions in the North Sea, it decided to cancel the landing attempt and recalled its main fleet. However, the British side failed to fully return its transport ships. Several of them were sunk by German bombers. Mr. Ribbentrop then mentioned British Prime Minister Chamberlain's remarks in the House of Commons regarding German aggression, saying that he is now presenting various documents in the name of the German government and truth and justice to prove that what the British and French rulers said is a lie. Mr. Ribbentrop then talked about the war in Norway, saying that the German army has broken through all enemy positions and defeated the Anglo-Norwegian Allied forces, causing them to collapse. Mr. Ribbentrop reiterated the matters mentioned in the German High Command's communiqué, saying that the several brigade orders obtained by the German army have proven that the British army's landing was prepared long ago. The orders for the first batch of troops to land were issued on April 6 and 7. Mr. Ribbentrop finally reiterated his previous remarks criticizing the Allied forces, and distributed a white paper containing the various documents he mentioned to the diplomats and reporters present.

<h3 id="e23">Contents of the German White Paper Reveal the Inside Story of British Military Operations <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>Berlin: The newly published German white paper (No. 4) briefly summarizes the content of this book in its preface. It is said that the German army obtained extremely valuable and interesting historical materials in Norway regarding the British army's plan to land in Norway (which was still a neutral country at the time) and the military measures taken by Britain within Norway, revealing inside secrets and hidden information. This can be said to be an unexpected gain for the German army. When the British and German armies first clashed in Lillehammer, the German army captured more than a dozen soldiers of the British 8th Battalion and found documents regarding the British army's plans and the orders issued by the commanders. The orders published in Category A prove that the military operations regarding landing in Norway had been planned in detail several weeks before the German side took action, and the expedition began on April 6 and 7. The 8th Battalion boarded the British cruiser "Glasgow" on April 7, prepared to depart for Norway and land in Stavanger. According to the diary of a British soldier obtained by the German army, the page for April 7 stated that the British soldiers were heading towards Stavanger. From this diary, we learned that the code used in the British army's orders, 547, referred to Stavanger. The above-mentioned documents can be used as solid evidence that the British expeditionary force had already been dispatched before the German army's attack on Norway. The assurances of British dignitaries that the Allied forces had not considered occupying the Scandinavian peninsula have been proven to be inaccurate by the orders of the British expeditionary force. The British army's landing plan was based on the intelligence of British and French officials in Norway. The German army has obtained the code and important letters of the British consul in Narvik and various documents of the French naval attaché in Norway, proving that the Allied forces had deployed a spy network in Norway. British naval personnel, under the name of consular personnel, were stationed in various Norwegian seaports. Although they were under the jurisdiction of the British Foreign Office, they still accepted the instructions of the British Admiralty's intelligence agencies. They cooperated with the British and French naval attachés in Norway. They traveled to various places to collect reliable intelligence, and the important secret instructions of the British Admiralty's intelligence agencies were transmitted by the British naval attaché in the capital of Sweden. British espionage work began at the end of last year and continued until April of this year, and all the intelligence needed to invade Norway had been obtained. British personnel often filled out various questionnaire forms, providing the intelligence needed for landing, including the most suitable docks for landing, the status of airfields, and the storage locations of coal and other fuels. The questions issued in January of this year were the most urgent. After Britain decided to land in Norway in April, it appointed a new consul stationed in Narvik, stipulating that he should take office on April 8. Due to special reasons for the appointment of the new consul, the British Admiralty obviously hoped that when troops were sent to land, there would be a confidant stationed in Narvik who understood the British plan. The French naval attaché's report proved that he had obtained the assistance of the Norwegian authorities when investigating intelligence "under the pretext of military transport to Finland." The British consul in Narvik was ordered to investigate the military deployments in northern Norway and the defense plans of various Norwegian seaports. The French naval attaché reported that a certain place in Trondheim Bay was "the best place for secret landing." British and French personnel had made detailed inquiries to officials in various parts of Norway. The Norwegian government failed to fulfill its obligations as a neutral country and assisted Britain's landing plan. Documents from the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs prove that the British Ambassador to Norway requested the right for Allied troops to pass through Norway to assist Finland from the Norwegian Foreign Minister on March 2 of this year. The Allied forces had the same request for Sweden. At that time, the Norwegian cabinet held a meeting and stated that if the Swedish government accepted this request, it would also be willing to allow troops to pass through. (Haitong dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<p>Berlin: The German white paper published the British and French plans to invade Norway, and mentioned that Norwegian officials were actually not neutral. The Norwegian foreign minister specifically advocated at a cabinet meeting held on March 2 that there was no need to prevent Allied troops from passing through Norway to Finland. Norway only needed to make a formal protest to Gutt, and he believed that Norway should not take attitudes that would endanger assisting the enemy in combat. At that time, Norway not only tolerated Britain's violation of neutrality, but was obviously prepared to assist Britain in combat. The Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs' archives prove that the Norwegian Ambassador to Britain submitted a secret report to the government on February 5, describing British Sea Lord Churchill's conversation with Norwegian reporters. At that time, Churchill admitted that the goal of British policy was to involve Sweden and Norway in the war, and that the best strategy to achieve this goal was for Sweden and Norway to assist Finland. Although the Norwegian government had understood Britain's true intentions, it continued to provide various conveniences to British spies and only made mild protests against Britain's repeated violations of Norwegian territorial waters. This attitude encouraged Britain's plan to undermine Norwegian neutrality. The Norwegian government had violated the interests of the people and deliberately assisted the Allied forces in realizing the plan to expand the war. (Haitong dispatch on the 27th)</p>

<h3 id="e25">The British Side Vehemently Rebuts the German Foreign Minister's Declaration, Accusing it of Fabricating Facts to Conceal Faults and Cover Up Mistakes <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>London: The London authorities issued a communiqué this afternoon rebutting Ribbentrop's speech as follows: "Ribbentrop's fabricated declaration deliberately reverses the facts from beginning to end. The world will not be slightly moved by it. He said that the war has no reason, and its reason lies in the premeditated attack on Poland. The UK and France are bound by treaty to Poland. The statement that the Allied forces are plotting to split Germany is unbelievable. The Prime Minister has made it clear that this slander is a malicious fallacy. As for the so-called British plot to attack Scandinavia, the facts are as follows: (1) The British and French governments publicly announced their decision to prevent Germany from usurping Norwegian territorial waters, so there was a decision to lay mines. (2) The Allied forces asked the governments of Norway and Sweden to allow them to pass through to transport troops to assist Finland, but they immediately gave up after being rejected. (3) The Norwegian government not only did not decide to join the Allied side to fight, but also firmly refused the Allied forces to pass through to Finland. (4) If the troops had been prepared to land in Norway, the Allied forces' assistance to Norway would not have been slightly delayed. This kind of delay is due to the temporary assembly of troops. (5) If the laying of mines was only a preparation for landing, the Allied forces would not have announced this measure. The reason why the Allied forces announced it was purely out of concern for the interests of neutral countries, and Germany has hitherto shown shameless contempt for the interests of neutral countries. (6) The German expeditionary force had set out many days before the laying of mines, which was admitted by German wireless broadcasts. (7) The German army's ability to land in Norway relied on the activities of German secret personnel. This is known to everyone. Now it is absurd and reckless to say that British personnel prepared for the British army to land. (8) The British government hopes that neutral countries should take self-defense measures to prevent German aggression. It is completely inaccurate to say that the Allied forces are plotting to expand the war. The views of neutral countries can be shown by the fact that no one has mobilized for fear of Allied aggression. The expansion of the war to the Scandinavian peninsula undoubtedly stems from the German government's deliberate actions. Now it wants to justify its actions based on so-called seized documents, but it did not consider it when the German army carried out the invasion. There is not a single word in Ribbentrop's speech that proves the legitimacy of the German army's invasion of Denmark, which is noteworthy. In Ribbentrop's mind, Denmark seems to be worthless."

<p>Stockholm, Sweden – German forces reoccupied the town of Røros in eastern Norway (within the province of Aust-Trøndelag) today. Heavy fighting is now occurring in the area between the town and the Swedish border between Allied forces (Havas, 27th). London – Norwegian military officials announced that Allied forces in Norway yesterday halted the enemy's advance in the areas of Gjøvik and Hallingdal, northwest of Oslo. The German forces used artillery and tanks in their attacks, but British forces have destroyed several German tanks. In the north, German motorized and mechanized units continue to advance towards Kvikne and Røros. German aircraft continue to bomb the Norwegian rear lines, with one plane shot down. In western Norway, German forces are advancing from Ulvik and Eidfjord, and from Bergen along the railway towards Voss. Voss is under bombardment from German artillery units from Eidfjord, and German aircraft are also bombing the area (Reuters, 27th).</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden – According to reports from war correspondents stationed in Norway, British units in the central part of the country have reached Otta and are fighting German forces at Kvam, on the Lillehammer-Dombås road. The outcome is still unknown. Observers note that the German mechanized units are now operating in snowy areas between two high mountains, which has greatly hampered their movements (Havas, 26th).</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden – News reported today states that on Thursday, 200 German soldiers arrived in Røros, south of Trondheim, carrying tanks and armored vehicles. It is reported that the German forces have detained three senior officials in the area and threatened to destroy the city if any German is harmed. As a result, the Norwegian army retreated, with one part heading north to Støren, and another part towards the Swedish border. Four hundred men have crossed into Sweden and have been detained. There are also rumors that Norwegian soldiers are crossing into Sweden at other locations, and the Norwegian authorities have issued orders to border officials to prevent Norwegian men from crossing the border (Reuters, 27th).</p>
<p>London – Military figures here have publicly acknowledged that Allied forces are in a difficult situation south of Trondheim, Norway. However, they say that given the Allied forces' courageous counterattacks despite the difficulties, this difficult situation was expected and there is no need to be pessimistic. According to reliable sources, German forces advancing from Trondheim have linked up with German forces on the railway line from Hamar to Trondheim. It seems that the Norwegian troops on the eastern part of the railway line have been defeated by the German forces. Although Anglo-French Allied forces have retreated to the south of Dombås, the city is still in Allied hands, so a section of the railway line to Trondheim remains under Allied control. Furthermore, the Allied side still possesses two advantages: (1) Supply to the Dombås area has not been cut off, and the morale of the Allied forces has been boosted by the arrival of fresh troops, which can still threaten Støren from Dombås. (2) The German air force was originally very rampant, but the strength of the Anglo-French air force has been replenished today, and a balance should be restored in the future. The Allied side is now equipped with a large number of anti-aircraft guns and fighter groups to resist German aircraft. As for the situation in the area directly north of Trondheim, there has been no change. Anglo-French Allied forces can still be resupplied from the coast. Although the German forces along the coast and on the eastern railway line have made contact, due to the Anglo-French allied fleet still controlling the Skagerrak and Kattegat straits, few German transport ships are able to reach their destination. According to the current situation, the Anglo-French Allied forces in the north may retreat to the positions directly north of Trondheim to concentrate their forces, but this move has not been fully decided. Even if they do, it will be temporary, because the Anglo-French Allied forces on warships will never give up their initiative (Havas, 27th).</p>
<p>Norwegian Terrain, Difficult to Fight In</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden – Swedish journalist Hedquist published an article in "Dagens Nyheter" yesterday, discussing the current war situation. He believes that Norwegian military resistance to Germany is largely futile because the difficulty of fighting in Europe has not been seen as in Norway. Only 2.5% of the land is arable. Twenty-four percent is forest, and the rest is barren mountains and wildlands, with crisscrossing mountains. Furthermore, all Norwegian cities with a population of more than 10,000, except for Tromsø in the north, are in German hands. There are thirty cities with a population of more than 5,000, and 23 of them have been occupied by German forces. Therefore, the journalist believes that further military resistance is futile (Haitong News Agency, 27th).</p>
<p>A Temporary Setback, Unrelated to the Overall Situation</p>
<p>London – The news that British forces in southern Norway need to make a limited retreat has not caused great concern among British newspapers. It is said that in large-scale warfare, temporary setbacks have no bearing on the final outcome of the war. The war in Norway is currently in its initial stages. The German forces' sudden invasion has gained them some military advantages, so we must prepare to deal with difficult military situations (Reuters, 27th).</p>
<p>German Troops Arriving in Norway Uninterrupted</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden – Local newspapers estimate that about 3,000 German soldiers are transported from bases in Denmark to Norway every day, transported by sea, land, and air, mostly gathered in the Oslo area. It is reported that the German side uses special small ships for transporting troops at sea (Reuters, 27th).</p>
<p>German Air Force Clearly Has the Upper Hand</p>
<p>London – Regarding the situation of the war in Norway, according to reliable sources, Allied forces have made significant progress in their advance towards Trondheim and have occupied the important stronghold of Støren. The German forces have occupied an important railway line in the Östersund area, seeking to establish contact with Trondheim. As a result, the Allied forces in the Lillehammer area have been forced to retreat under pressure. Military observers say that the number of Allied troops is far less than that of the German forces, and it is not easy to defeat the German forces. If the German forces can consolidate their positions in Trondheim, the Allied forces will face even greater difficulties and may have to temporarily focus all their efforts on the war in northern Norway. Furthermore, according to the communiqué issued by the British War Office, it can be seen that Allied forces north of Steinkjer have also retreated due to strong German pressure. There is currently no fighting in the area, only patrols are active. In short, what the Allied forces lack is high-speed fighter jets and anti-aircraft artillery to resist the German air force. Also, the lack of suitable air bases for the air force in Norway is a major shortcoming (Havas, 26th).</p>

<p>London – Reuters learned from responsible sources that during a large-scale raid by the British Air Force on Thursday night, they bombed the Stavanger airfield again, and attacked oil pools and refineries a few miles north of Moss. Several German supply ships in the bay near Stavanger, and ten German large supply ships in the Oslofjord, were all bombed. Due to poor visibility, the results of the air raid could not be fully known, but a 5,000-ton giant ship was definitely directly hit, and the refinery in Vallo was indeed on fire. According to a pilot, the entire area was ablaze when British aircraft flew away. On Thursday afternoon, a large bomb exploded less than ten yards from the starboard bow of a German transport ship in Granvinfjord. The wharf in the bay was also hit. A German supply ship in another bay was attacked by British aircraft, and the ship heeled over and partially sank. On the way back, British aircraft shot down a German Dornier seaplane (Reuters, 27th).</p>

<p>Stockholm, Sweden – Swedish political groups will jointly issue an appeal yesterday, reiterating Sweden's determination to strictly adhere to neutrality, and have scheduled a national neutrality parade on May 1st, also to show Sweden's determination to defend its freedom and independence (Haitong News Agency, 27th).</p>
<p>Paris – Sweden's attitude is now receiving special attention from French political figures. However, it is believed that the many German ships full of soldiers, lighting fires in the ports along the Baltic Sea coast, are probably not being used to attack Sweden, but are actually heading to Norway for reinforcements. Germany requested last week that Swedish authorities allow German military supplies to be transported through Sweden to Norway, although this was rejected. However, German medical rescue teams still passed through Sweden, and 200 wounded soldiers were transported back to Germany via Sweden. In addition, German sailors previously detained by Swedish authorities have been released after being proven to be ordinary merchant sailors. All of these points prove that Germany is interpreting international law in the broadest sense and is trying to gain as much benefit as possible from Sweden within its permitted scope. In reality, Sweden's supply of needed goods has been cut off since the outbreak of the war in Norway, and its situation is indeed very difficult. Therefore, it has had to conduct business negotiations with Germany and the Soviet Union. A Swedish delegation recently arrived in Berlin, and German economic experts will also travel to Stockholm. In addition, business negotiations between Sweden and the Soviet Union will also begin in the shortest possible time (Havas, 26th).</p>

<p>Shantou Correspondence: In early April, the Japanese side sent reinforcements to Chaoshan, including the Chida unit, the Shimomura unit, and Northeast puppet troops, numbering about five to six thousand, gathered in Chaoan, Anbu, Chenghai city, three strongholds, and along the Chaoshan Railway line. Recently, they advanced along the Anjie Highway to attack Yujiao, Jieyang. They were ambushed by the Chinese army on the banks of the Guoxi River. The Japanese army then turned its military front northward and on the 12th, went straight to Linjiapo, Guxiang. At the same time, the army and air force massively invaded the upper reaches of the Han River, crossing Po Jiling, and bombing Hulu City, 36 Heights, Shaxitou, Gouxia Village, and other places. They were all fiercely attacked and annihilated by the Chinese army and people. On the 13th, they retreated to the strongholds on the outskirts of Chaoan City, and changed to blindly bombarding from artillery positions on Dajian Peak, Wenli Mountain, Yunti Mountain, and Bijia Mountain. They also sent planes to fly low and drop bombs in Chaojie, Fengrao, and other places, destroying many villages and houses. The people in various places were aroused by righteous indignation and joined the National Army Corps and guerrilla detachments to launch night attacks on the Japanese rear strongholds. Yunbu City, Jiange, and Yinhu were attacked simultaneously on the night of the 12th. On the 14th, the army again sent 2,000 reinforcements from Shantou to Chaoan. On the morning of the 15th, more than 700 people, mixed with cavalry and artillery, broke through the Chinese army's control line southwest of Fengxi (both sides of Guoxi River), and attacked Daling and Longxiang Village south of Anjie Road. Fierce battles broke out again. The Japanese cavalry launched four attacks on the Chinese army. After a day of fierce fighting, they were finally defeated by the Chinese army and fled to Xucuo Township. The Chinese army pursued them, and the Japanese army abandoned horses and artillery and fled in a panic. The Chinese army pursued past Xixiang, Fengxi, and took advantage of the victory to send troops south, attacking Fuyang Gezhou in the sixth district. On the morning of the 16th, the two armies fought fiercely on the shores of Bailian Lake. The Japanese artillery on Qingma Mountain fired to assist in the battle. The Chinese guerrillas detoured Jinshi, bypassed Wuyang, and attacked the rear of the Japanese army on Qingma Mountain. The main force on the front of Anjie Road crossed Bailian Lake and went straight to Fuyang Station. The rear route of the Japanese artillery on Qingma Mountain was cut off, and they could not support the battle. They fled in a panic. The Chinese army rushed to the hilltop, beheaded more than a hundred people, and seized four mountain cannons, and immediately recovered Qingma Mountain. The Japanese army sent reinforcements to defend Turtle Mountain. The Chinese army then lured the Japanese army to Sihuanggang and surrounded them for a fierce battle. After four hours of fierce fighting, they killed more than 200 Japanese soldiers. After the remaining Japanese troops were defeated and returned to Turtle Mountain, they held firm and dared not come out again. At present, there are no traces of the Japanese army south of Anjie Highway. Lin Wenxian, the magistrate of Jieyang County, led the elite troops of the county's National Army Corps and joined the first regiment of the reserve division of the artillery city, holding Taoshan Tagang, Xigang, Xiapu Mountain, and Dahuangkeng. Shaxitou controls the entire Sangpu Mountains, looking down on Caitang, Huamei, Anbu, and Pengzhou, echoing the Chenghai guerrillas, specializing in night attacks on villages along the Chaoshan Railway.</p>
<p>The Japanese police commander stationed in Anbu, Horino, convened a joint township meeting in Guanlu Township on the 12th, called the "Pacification Conference." The puppet maintenance chairmen and puppet township chiefs from various places were present, about 40 puppets from places such as Guanchao, Dazhai, and Bietou. They decided on (1) adopting a joint township system, re-compiling household registrations and organizing baojia to prevent plainclothes teams from mixing in and responding to guerrilla warfare; (2) each puppet township chief was given three days to find ways to lure the escaped young men back to their hometown to resume farming; (3) appointing Chen Dianchen, the puppet chairman of Bietou, as the chairman of the joint township association, responsible for organizing the joint township White Guard team to eliminate plainclothes teams within the territory. The conference closed on the 13th. When the puppets returned to their hometowns, Horino sent puppet soldiers to protect them back. The puppet township chiefs took the opportunity to compile doorplates and conscript young men, and ordered each clan chief to hand over their sons and nephews who had left home. If they were not handed over within three days, they would have to pay a fine. They also forced the villagers to pay money in the name of "pacification." After hearing this news, the young men who participated in guerrilla work were deeply angered and decided to first attack their hometowns and eradicate the puppet township chiefs to relieve the people from their suffering.</p>

<p>Jiangyin Correspondence: The former Huaming Electric Light Company outside Beiwai Gate West supplied electricity to the entire county. When the war broke out, some of the houses were destroyed. After the occupation, the Japanese army had no electricity, so they used two diesel engines from the Hongchang Cloth Factory in Zhongjie and the Xinkang Cloth Factory in Nancheng to start generating electricity for military use. The streets and alleys in the city are still as dark as pitch. The other day, the Japanese company Shin Kichi Electric Power Company specially sent a large number of craftsmen to repair the power plant machinery in order to generate electricity. From then on, the power plant business was occupied by the Japanese again.</p>

<h3 id="e44">Overseas Chinese Schools in Thailand Almost Completely Closed; Learning Chinese Has Also Become a Problem <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>(Bangkok Airmail News) Overseas Chinese education in Thailand has suffered a devastating blow since last autumn. Whether in Bangkok or in the inland areas, nine out of ten schools have been closed. Some Chinese schools in the inland areas are still勉力(endeavoring) to operate in accordance with the regulations of the Thai Ministry of Education, but as a result, they have been forced to close down. The Tao Ying School in 萬倫埠 (Wan Lun Bu) and the chance to nurture virtue have been cut off for unwarranted reasons. The fate of Chinese schools in other small ports can be predicted.</p>
<p>呵叻 (Korta) is an important city in northeastern Thailand. The number of overseas Chinese living here is second to none except for Bangkok. The public Chinese school, Tongwen School, there also shares the same fate as other Chinese schools and was closed on April 15th.</p>
<p>The Rose School in Bangkok, founded by the French, has had quite good results in the past. After the closure of Xinmin, Huanghun, and Yumin Chinese schools last year, the school, being run by Westerners, was able to teach Chinese as a foreign language according to the education regulations. Most of the overseas Chinese students who were still of compulsory education age went to study at the school, and the number of students increased from more than 300 to more than 700. Finally, due to the limitations of the school building and regulations, it was unable to accommodate as many overseas Chinese students as possible. Recently, the school authorities, citing the sharp increase in the number of students and the fact that the school was originally divided into male and female departments with school buildings far apart, although the school administration was unified, the management felt difficult, so they planned to submit a request to the Ministry of Education during this summer vacation to separate the male and female departments and make them independent. The Ministry of Education has accepted the submission, but the school will stop teaching Chinese and replace it with English when school resumes after the summer vacation. As a result, more than 700 overseas Chinese students have been deprived of the opportunity to learn their ancestral language.</p>

<p>The yarn market continued to rise, and the upward trend was even more intense. Although actual sales were increasingly sluggish, people's minds were very enthusiastic. As for the soft foreign exchange and the decline in gold, only cotton yarn and cotton have become a trend of only rising, not falling, which is probably due to the筹碼 (chips) relationship. In the recent two days, the market has been pulled up by arbitrageurs.</p>
<p>The current yarn market opened in the morning with extraordinary popularity. Everyone was shouting to buy in. The initial price of 20-count Double Horse factory was 1,490 yuan, and then it jumped out of the customs price to 1,508 yuan.

<p>The transaction of this cotton is still 평범 (mediocre), but Indian cotton transactions are becoming more and more lively. This is because the yarn market is good, and Qingdao has a little need. The Hua-Japanese factory procurement is still sluggish. The current cotton transaction situation is listed on the left:</p>
<p>Xing Heng 244.0 148.00 Same industry entered 200 pieces</p>

<p>Yesterday's futures transactions in Shanghai's foreign cotton market have gradually become quiet, but spot transactions have become more active. This is because some peers who have more difficult economic operations are purchased by other peers with more abundant funds. All parties see the cotton price will rise. Due to the urgent need for funds, they have to sell it at this price. This transaction is actually 30 to 40 yuan cheaper than the price sold by foreign firms. The price of cotton market yesterday converted to factory price at a rate of 6 yuan per US dollar is as follows:</p>
<p>20 count American Metlin 294.30</p>

<p>Yesterday's cash烚赤 (cooking red) market situation, because it was Saturday, the market was only open for half a day as usual, the 　trend was not good, and it was getting worse and worse, with a total of 8 consecutive days of decline, but the rate of decline was lower than the rise, so the total轧(rolling) was only down 200 yuan, and the whole picture today was fluctuating and twisting without large movements, from the morning opening to the noon closing, a certain line exchange industry 　a certain securities gang was the most powerful in selling, and soon the supply and demand of the position was disparate, and it broke into the 5,600 yuan mark to see a low price of 5,580 yuan, Relying on the silver number and gold number gang to search and purchase, the pull was effective, and the closing price was 5,610 yuan, which was 25 yuan lower than the previous day, and there was little news of成交 (transaction) outside the market in the afternoon, and the half-day transaction was about 2,000 taels, the jewelry gold in the silver shop was挂小(slightly hung) 5 yuan, and the customs gold, etc. remained 평 (flat).</p>
<p>烚赤 (cooking red) Has Been Linked to Small Eight Days</p>
<p>Since the morning each條(strip) (ten taels), the initial opening was quite tired, the gold number, etc. pressed the price to sell, lacking a master, the market fell 35 yuan, the silver number gave 60 taels to the silver shop gang and the same industry, all for 5,600 yuan, then some retail investors saw the cheap and did more, plus the Yu number also bought, and the return回(turned) up 20 yuan, the gold number mutually did 10 taels, for 5,620 yuan, But at that time, the goods absorbed by a certain money exchange industry on the previous day suddenly wanted to exit, and the retail investors also took profits and released, and the buyers' stomachs were not healthy, and the position suddenly felt宽裕(comfortable), and the fall fell another 15 yuan, the securities gang gave 20 taels to the silver shop, for 5,605 yuan, then a certain silver number suddenly代(substituted) the customer to force it to drag, the selling momentum was temporarily frustrated, and it was seen to rise 10 yuan again, the silver number entered 10 taels from the money exchange industry, for 5,615 yuan, after that the securities gang suddenly came to傾(pour)吐(spit), a certain silver number also turned from buying to selling, and a certain money exchange industry also came to競塞(compete to obstruct), the selling momentum expanded for a while, and suddenly it was miserable to enter the 5,600 yuan mark, the securities gang gave 20 taels to the gold number, losing 5,580 yuan, a certain silver number and gold number, etc. "cheap collapse cheap捞(dredge)进 (enter), and the shortseller saw the situation and made up for it, and soon it was back out of the 5,600 yuan mark, and then added the silver number gang to come and扒(grab), The father returned to a high of more than 10 yuan, the gold number mutually did 30 taels, for 5,618 yuan, and when it was close to closing, the buying momentum was slightly subdued, and then slightly 8 yuan, the gold number gave 10 taels to the silver number, for 5,610 yuan as the noon closing price, and as a result, it continued to fall 25 yuan from the previous day, and it was found that it had been liên (continuously) small for eight days, totaling 217 yuan, with a half-day fluctuation of 40 yuan, The sale price of the cash number's own brand gold was reduced by 20 yuan compared to the higher purchase price of烚赤 (cooking red), and the current target gold was 50 yuan lower than the list price, and both were less done.</p>

<h3 id="e57">Textile Goods: Futures Trading Volume Exceeds 100,000 Bolts; Arbitrage Reaches 70-80% <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>The cloth market yesterday was one of the busiest days for futures settlement this month. Due to the sharp rise in yarn prices and high opening prices for next month's spot yarn and cloth, arbitrage reached 70-80% of the deposit. For expensive spot cloth prices, there were more people willing to buy in order to sell, so the selling price also rose the most. However, there were a lot of goods on the market. Due to sluggish actual sales, hoarders disregarded them, and most selling orders were stagnant. All of this is the result of speculation. Yesterday, Dapeng Fugui fine cloth and fine twill each rose by 5 jiao to 1 yuan per bolt. Ewo group cloth rose by 7.5 jiao. Lun Chang Ewo bleached and dyed cloth was cheaper than the market price due to flat sales. The most traded cloth this season were those for May delivery, totaling over 100,000 bolts. Customer sales lacked bulk orders. Demand from Yunnan and Guangdong merchants was better.</p>
<p>The Dong cloth market continued to be strong. Twelve-pound Dragon Head fine cloth opened at 46.25 yuan per bolt in the morning. Afterwards, due to the rise in yarn prices, although actual sales were not smooth, the hoarding sentiment inside and outside the industry was still strong. Therefore, the Dragon Head spot stock order at closing was opened at 46.4 yuan. Next month's futures rose to 48.5 yuan. Four Gentlemen serge increased to 1.435 yuan per yard. Next month's futures were 1.51 yuan.</p>
<p>Cloth exports: 200 pieces were shipped to Xiamen on the 28th, 445 pieces to Hong Kong, 318 pieces to Tianjin, and 250 pieces to Yantai.</p>
<h3 id="e58">Food: Rice Market Remains Stable <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>The rice market, after turning higher on the morning of the previous day and then softening again in the afternoon, showed a weaker trend at the opening yesterday morning and finally declined. This is because the rise in price was entirely due to speculative sentiment, with no real foundation, making it easy to fluctuate. Moreover, short covering is not constant and actual sales are weak. Such a market is known to be forced, and lacks lasting power. Therefore, those holding goods took advantage of this opportunity to sell their profitable goods. However, buyers remained on the sidelines, unwilling to accept the offer, making it difficult for the market to sustain itself, and it soon turned bearish. The prices of various foreign rice varieties fell by varying degrees of 6-7 jiao. For example, Little Twisted opened at 41.7-41.8 yuan. Afterwards, some local shops slightly increased their intake in preparation for the Sunday holiday, and the weak trend began to subside slightly, gradually becoming range-bound. Although there was a period of volatility in the middle, it was entirely due to speculative sentiment, and a reversal was expected. As a result, the closing price was about half a yuan lower than the previous day, with No. 1 Saigon at 46 yuan. Mixed broken rice and green beans remained stable due to similar supply and demand.</p>
<p>Over 2,000 bags of japonica and glutinous domestic rice arrived. Sales were relatively active because prices were lower than foreign rice. However, traders were reluctant to buy because they feared that the weather would cause the rice to spoil. Therefore, the market did not fluctuate. However, older stock was weaker, with prices falling by 3-5 jiao. In the market, Changxi aged japonica was selling for only 40 yuan, or 39.5 yuan; Nangang early rice was 39.5 yuan or 39 yuan; glutinous rice was similar; Li Dan fresh yuan rice was selling for about 38-39 yuan, while soft and damp old rice was only 35-36 yuan.</p>
<p>Foreign rice soared the day before yesterday, appearing to be on the verge of another price spike. However, after the market opened yesterday, actual sales were deterred by the high prices and merchants were unable to continue buying. Furthermore, Dumai rice continued to arrive following foreign rice, with Japanese merchants especially eager to sell at lower prices. And with the financial situation extremely tight, most of those with floating profits were eager to sell. Although major firms and large households were still trying to hold on, the market was ultimately suppressed by the unloading of goods by floating holders. Prices for all grades of foreign rice fell by 4-5 jiao compared to the previous day. However, hoarders still bought back futures for closing, and original brokers also bought back. Apart from a batch of low-priced goods transacted the day before yesterday, no further orders were placed. Therefore, No. 2 West Real for April and May was still priced at 93.5 yuan, and the original settlement price was 53 yuan. Total transactions for the day were over 200 tons, and spot volume was about 6,000 bags.</p>
<h3 id="e59">Flour and Wheat: Stand-Off <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Flour: Spot flour trading was sluggish yesterday. Due to prolonged stagnation in export sales and the impact of domestic flour dumping on small-scale retail sales in the city, the intake of flour has decreased. The total number of bags directly sold by the factory was only about 5,000 bags. The price for No. 2 flour from the factory was still 13.8 yuan, and the same grade of old car brand was slightly lower by 1 jiao. But due to the standoff between buyers and sellers, no transactions were completed. It was also reported that the price of domestic flour in Changxi was 13.2-13.3 yuan, and 1,000-3,000 bags were transacted, all of which were handled by merchants in the city.</p>
<p>Wheat: Trading was stagnant again yesterday. This is because the source of supply has been lacking for a long time, and stocks have long been depleted. Old wheat has already passed its peak season, and new wheat is about to enter the market. Although the harvest is still some time away, wheat seedlings are growing very rapidly, and a bumper wheat harvest is expected this year. The factory intends to suppress wheat prices at this time, while holders are still thinking of defending their position. As a result, there were no transactions. It was also reported that the delivery of goods to the factory was also quiet due to the weekend.</p>
<h3 id="e60">Securities: Domestic Bonds Hover <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Securities gray market: The market was extremely stable yesterday. The bulls wanted to push the market up, but were limited by their lack of strength. The bears wanted to push the market down, but felt that there was no flow of spot goods. High-interest loans were incompatible with the interest income from public bonds themselves, and lending was bound to be rejected by those who had spot goods, as it was unfavorable to the bulls. Therefore, most of the purchases in the market were for short covering, and the sales were for bulls who were unwilling to be pressured by high interest rates and sold their holdings. There were very few new transactions, and the market was therefore in a hovering pattern, which was not easy to break out of for the time being. Yesterday, there were only a handful of buyers and sellers, mostly Hongda and Yitai buying, and Tongkang, Jiufeng, and No. 20 selling. Transactions were even scarcer in the afternoon, with a total transaction volume of just over 500,000. A brief table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock trading: Five shares of Chunghwa Book Company were traded at a price of 31.5 yuan.</p>
<p>The 30th annual shareholders' meeting of the English commercial firm, Inada Oak Company, general manager of the local Exchange Bank, will be held in Shanghai on May 10. The final dividend for 1939 is proposed to be 6 jiao in national currency, for a total of 1 yuan including the interim dividend.</p>
<p>London, 26th (Friday): The listed prices of notes continued to rise. The listed prices of the Maccali Bank shares continued to rise by 3 shillings and 9 pence, to 9 pounds, 8 shillings, and 9 pence. The Kola Kelin Rubber shares rose by 4.5 pence, to 18 shillings and 6 pence. The rest remained unchanged. London, 26th (Friday): The listed prices of Chinese foreign debt remained stable today. There were no changes in any of the bonds on the upper and lower tiers.</p>

<p>Yesterday, domestic sugar showed a tight trend. Xinghua merchants offered dozens of bags of Xinghua medium white at 70 yuan, dozens of bags of superior blue at 53.5 yuan, and 70 cases of sliced blue at 46 yuan. Guangdu merchants offered 60 cases of Shimen sliced blue at 43 yuan, and 100 bags of Dongxiang red at 44.1 yuan. For Jiang merchants' Gao Diao blue, the broker was still offering 52.5 yuan, which has not yet been settled with the Association. The spot market for 24 coarse white sugar continued to soften slightly. New goods from foreign warehouses were 63 yuan to 62.95 yuan. Tai Koo Car White B Mark West Warehouse rose 8 jiao to 72.6 yuan, old goods were 72.35 yuan to 72.45 yuan. H Mark Car Red was 50.8 yuan, up 2 jiao. Dutch Red was 53.7 yuan, down 1 jiao.</p>

<p>The recent active sales of golden needles have caused prices to rebound, with market prices rising by 2-3 yuan. Merchants from Guangdong and other regions have been purchasing in recent days.

<h3 id="e65">Woolens: Discussing the Western-style Clothing Accessories Concurrently Operated by the Woolen Industry <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>In Shanghai, in addition to specializing in the sale of woolens, most woolen businesses also deal in various accessories, such as feather yarn, interlinings, foreign cloth, buttons, silk yarn, thread, lining goods, dyes, gold trim, sleeve and hat bands, fire white plaid, brushstrokes (i.e., new Western-style clothing samples), white foreign tape, hangers, irons, scissors, soft and hard rulers, etc. These accessories are entirely sold to Western-style clothing tailors. The total number of imports over the years has also been considerable. In recent years, Western-style clothing has become popular, and the number of men's and women's clothing stores has increased, so sales have also gradually expanded. In the past three to five years, woolen businesses, in addition to feather yarn, foreign cloth, horse mane satin, French-style lining, and black-gray lining, have generally stopped dealing in other accessories, because those who specialize in this include Yuanchang Xinghua Foreign, Zhang Xiangtai Zhang Weitai, Dechang, and Dachang, etc.</p>
<p>In the year after the Shanghai War, the population of the Isolated Island was concentrated, and commerce was abnormally prosperous. Woolens and accessories were actively priced. Yuanchang Xing and Huayang each set up a branch and used street vendors to promote sales, maintain customer relations, and extend credit, so that buyers were deeply impressed. Therefore, business under this system is the most developed for these two businesses, just like Chunhe Yong and Huaxin in the woolen industry are the leaders.</p>
<p>Western-style feather yarn comes in two types: plain and twill. Plain is popular in hot weather, and twill is popular in cold weather. Many Shanghai small machine households produce domestic products, which are also very popular throughout the four seasons, which is silk-gloss feather yarn. Because silk-gloss feather yarn is beautiful and inexpensive, sales of imported twill and plain feather yarn have sharply declined. Interlinings include French-style continued scolding lining, charcoal lining, soft lining, hard lining, pocket cloth lining, and pulp glue lining. Except for A277 French-style lining, very few foreign goods are currently arriving, and the market trading is entirely for domestic goods that are out of stock. Foreign cloth includes patterned foreign cloth and plain gray foreign cloth. Only patterned foreign cloth is currently selling well. Western goods were long ago defeated by Eastern goods and are rarely imported. And Eastern goods have recently been replaced by domestic factory goods, and sales have decreased by two-thirds. The most famous brand among thread goods is Hongsheng. Buttons and buckles, regardless of overcoats, raincoats, long gowns, socks, vests, etc., were initially entirely Western goods from the United States, Britain, and Germany. Later, with the dumping of Japanese goods, Western goods imports gradually decreased. In recent years, domestic buttons have been of excellent quality, and Japanese goods imports have also decreased. Among silk threads, the most widely sold products recently are domestic factory goods, followed by Soviet products. Lining goods: In ancient times, feather silk, feather satin, feather Jin, and Western satin were popular, but they have now been eliminated. Horse mane satin currently circulating in the market is entirely domestic goods woven in this city. Dyes (i.e., face powder): domestic, French, and Japanese goods are all produced, but most cannot be sold. The English S brand is still the most famous, because S brand dyes are easy to create clear lines, have fewer thick edges, and are more durable than miscellaneous brand powders. Sales of gold trim and sleeve and hat trim are extremely small, mostly only from England and Japan. Large checkered and white checkered cloth are entirely domestic goods, with very few imported goods. Brushstrokes, regardless of size, are all newly shipped from England to Shanghai. Sales of white foreign cloth have declined greatly recently. Hangers were initially all shipped from foreign countries, but for the past ten years or so, they have been entirely made by Chinese. English ironing knives and scissors are the best quality and also more expensive, followed by domestic goods. English leather belts and soft rulers are better, but recently Chinese have also been weaving them, but users say that they are easy to shrink and fade, so sales are not as good as imported goods. The sales trends of imported and domestic rulers are similar, but special-shaped rulers are still more actively sold from abroad. Short-shaped city rulers are widely sold domestically.</p>

<p>French Ambassador to China, Cosme, is in Shanghai to deal with private affairs and to escape the summer heat. On the 19th of this month, he flew from Chongqing to Hong Kong, and then came to Shanghai on the French Postal Steamship Company's Flex L'Sonny wheel. The local French Embassy received telegrams from the Ambassador from Hong Kong, both the day before yesterday and yesterday morning, reporting the dates. The ship is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai at 10:00 AM today and will dock at the Gonghexiang Wharf.</p>
<p>French People Sympathize with the War of Resistance</p>
<p>On the afternoon of November 10th last year, the French Ambassador left Shanghai on the Java Company's Chibard ship for Hong Kong to negotiate issues related to Vietnamese transportation. He then flew to Hanoi to meet with Vietnamese Governor-General Jia Shijilun, and then took the滇越 railway to Chongqing, arriving at noon on the 22nd. He paid respects to the central authorities and attended banquets held by the Foreign Affairs Association and the Sino-French-Belgian-Swiss Cultural Association. At the Sino-French-Belgian-Swiss Cultural Association, the Ambassador stated, "France has always expressed sympathy for China. Every French person expresses the utmost admiration for China's great past and limitless future. These are heartfelt words. China's spirit of resistance, the struggle of the Chinese nation, and the heroism of the Chinese army are even more admirable." During the dinner, the French Ambassador generously donated 2,000 French francs to be used as the Association's expenses.</p>
<p>Paying Respects to Chairman Chiang</p>
<p>The Ambassador met with British Ambassador Cole, American Ambassador Johnson, and Soviet Ambassador 姚友新 in Chongqing. People in Chongqing considered it rare to have the ambassadors of four countries in one place during China's War of Resistance. Among them, the French Ambassador was the first to arrive in Chongqing. It was previously rumored that the French Ambassador had requested Yunnan's neutrality from Chongqing officials, but this statement was entirely unfounded and the Ambassador absolutely denied it. The Ambassador's wife flew from Hanoi to Chongqing by 中舫 plane on December 9th of last year. During his stay in Chongqing, Mr. Cosme paid respects to Chairman Chiang on December 3rd of last year.</p>
<p>Visiting Vietnam Once to Treat Dental Issues</p>
<p>The Ambassador went to Hanoi on March 29th to treat dental problems. After treatment, he flew back to Chongqing from Hanoi at 3:30 PM on the 10th of this month. The Ambassador is now going to Hong Kong on the 19th of this month to deal with private affairs in Shanghai and to escape the summer heat, taking the French Postal Steamship Company's Flex L'Sonny to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Consul General Paul Discharged from Hospital the Day Before Yesterday</p>
<p>Also, a reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned from French sources that French Consul General Paul, due to illness, has been recovering at a certain hospital for quite some time. All embassy affairs have been handled by Ms. Archie. Now that the French Ambassador will return to Shanghai today, Consul General Paul was discharged from the hospital the day before yesterday afternoon. It is rumored that after meeting with Ambassador Cosme, Mr. Paul will leave Shanghai for a short trip, and then return to his country.</p>
<h3 id="e68">Important Resolutions of the Price Stabilization Committee: Continuing to Purchase Foreign Rice; Agreement Signed to Purchase 60,000 Bags; Striving to Reach 1 Million Yuan in Donations <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the Municipal Price Stabilization Committee has handled price stabilization three times, benefiting the common people to a great extent. In order to handle the fourth price stabilization matter, the committee specially convened its fifth plenary committee meeting at the Shipping Club on Guangjia Road yesterday afternoon.</p>
<p>Mr. Yu Qiaqing's Opening Remarks</p>
<p>Mr. Yu Qiaqing gave the opening speech as chairman. He said, "Today, our association is holding its fifth plenary committee meeting. Everyone has taken the trouble to attend, demonstrating your sincere enthusiasm for caring about the welfare of the public, which is truly gratifying. Since the fourth plenary committee meeting resolved to continue handling price stabilization, at the eighth standing committee meeting on April 13, the committee members present recognized a total of more than 300,000 yuan on the spot. However, it is still more than 600,000 yuan short of the original target of 1 million yuan. Of course, we still need to work hard to raise the shortfall in order to achieve the original intention of stabilizing the community and maintaining the people's food supply. I believe everyone is clear-sighted and understands the overall situation. You must know that providing relief to the people's food supply in Shanghai is one of the most important undertakings to protect the entire community. If this goal is relaxed, I fear that social turmoil will arise, or even shake the entire city's order and security, which would be worse than theft. These are not deliberately alarmist words, but are concerns that must be prevented. I hope you will do your best to raise the remaining 600,000 yuan to maintain this undertaking. Saving others is saving yourself, and the poor and needy are our compatriots. I hope you will understand the above foolish intentions and not dismiss them as groundless worries."</p>
<p>Unanimously Passed: Continuing to Pledge Donations</p>
<p>After Mr. Yu's speech, the discussion on the price stabilization issue began. As a result, the following was resolved: (1) Unanimously passed to continue pledging donations, and each industry will do its best to handle it, striving to achieve the goal of 1 million yuan; (2) Continuing to order 60,000 bags of crushed rice; (3) As soon as the call for deposits is completed and the donations are collected to a considerable amount, the price stabilization will be started on a regular basis. It is learned that, in order to expedite the process, the association will entrust foreign firms to send a telegram to Saigon to order 60,000 bags of broken rice. The negotiations are still in progress, and the fixed date for tribute rice price stabilization will be soon. Millions of civilians are eagerly awaiting its immediate implementation to relieve their immediate needs.</p>

<p>US High Commissioner to the Philippines, Sayre, and his wife, accompanied by Naval Attaché Major MacVan, left for Japan on the President Pierce Wheel at 11:30 PM last night. The President Pierce Wheel was originally scheduled to arrive in 比 on the morning of the 26th, but due to the strong winds encountered on the way to Shanghai, it was delayed until 4:30 PM this afternoon. The arrival time in Shanghai differed by nine hours. Mr. Sayre and his party left the Customs Wharf on the Jianghai Customs 塢麗 small wheel at 10:00 PM yesterday. US Consul General 美赫德 Admiral, Colonel Baker, and all friends in Shanghai went to the dock to see them off. It is expected that Mr. Sayre will arrive in Tokyo by the end of the month. Ambassador Ger is preparing to welcome everything. Dr. Monroe, a famous American educator who arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday, was also on the same ship as Mr. Sayre. It is said that Mr. Monroe does not intend to land during this trip to Japan and will return directly to the United States.</p>
<h3 id="e70">The Da Mei Bao Printing House Was Suddenly Attacked Yesterday Morning; Hand Grenades Were Thrown, But the Damage Was Minor; All the Deceased Thugs Who Resisted Arrest Escaped <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>The Da Mei Printing House at No. 19, Avenue Edward VII, French Concession (the printing house for the English "Da Mei Evening News", the Chinese "Da Mei Evening News," and the "Da Mei Bao") was suddenly attacked by thugs at 5:05 AM yesterday morning, while the "Da Mei Bao" was being printed. One person resisted arrest and died on the spot. Three workers in the machine room were injured by shrapnel from the hand grenades thrown by the thugs. At the time, patrol officers and thugs engaged in a fierce battle, exchanging fire for ten minutes. Stray bullets injured one passerby and one vendor, both dressed in Western clothing. The thugs eventually escaped. When the thugs' car sped away on Beijing Road, it ran over and killed one pedestrian. Fortunately, the "Da Mei Bao's" printing press was not damaged, and the "Da Mei Bao" currently being printed was published as usual. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Daybreak Robbery</p>
<p>The thugs who attacked the Da Mei Printing House had hired car No. 18429 of the Xiang Sheng Automobile Company's Jiaozhou Road branch at the predetermined location at 3:05 AM yesterday morning. A Mr. Zhang, driver No. 9, drove the car. The thugs instructed him to drive to the Jin Situ Temple on Connaught Road. When the car arrived, the thugs inside suddenly pulled out Mauser pistols, threatening the driver to get out. He was taken by another thug to a nearby back alley and imprisoned. Four thugs who were waiting there boarded the car and drove straight to the back door of the Da Mei Printing House on Rue du Consulat.</p>
<p>Sneaking In and Throwing Grenades</p>
<p>The thugs' car arrived at the back door of the Da Mei Printing House at 5:05 AM yesterday morning. Four thugs immediately got out of the car. There was usually a French Concession armored car and one Vietnamese constable stationed there. To avoid attracting attention, one of the thugs, pretending to be a newspaper buyer, started chatting with the Vietnamese constable, as they had arranged previously. The Vietnamese constable, suspecting nothing, allowed the other three to sneak in. Upon reaching the door of the machine room, the thugs immediately threw two hand grenades at the "Da Mei Bao" printing press, which was in operation. There was a loud explosion in an instant, and the windows and doors of nearby buildings were shattered. The thugs threw one grenade at the English "Da Mei Evening News" press, but it did not explode. At that time, the "Da Mei Bao" was being printed, and fortunately, only the belt was damaged, not the press. Therefore, after minor repairs, it continued to be published, only delayed by nearly three hours compared to usual.</p>
<p>Resisting Arrest and Fighting</p>
<p>After the hand grenades exploded, the thugs immediately rushed out, jumped back into the original car, and fled south. At this time, an armored car and several Chinese and Western detectives, who were usually stationed in front of the Da Mei Bao, had heard the explosion and arrived at the scene. They fired at the thugs' car with submachine guns and rifles. The thugs fired back while speeding south on Avenue de la Mission, then turning east onto the Bund. When the thugs' car reached the Bund on Avenue Edward VII, the armored car and the Chinese and Western detectives fired intensively at it. The sounds of machine guns, pistols, and rifles mixed together. The detectives were unable to chase the car on foot, and the thugs escaped. As the thugs fled, they also released smoke bombs for cover. The two sides engaged in a fierce battle for ten minutes. It is unknown whether any of the thugs were injured in the car. However, it is known that as the car sped westward on Beijing Road, it ran over and killed a pedestrian because it was driving too fast and without regard for anything.</p>
<p>Vietnamese Constable Killed</p>
<p>When the thugs threw hand grenades at the printing house, the imposter posing as a news vendor who remained outside the printing house and was talking to Vietnamese constable No. 34 (Phan Van Phul), 24 years old, responded by pulling out a pistol from his sleeve. He went around to the back of the car and, catching the Vietnamese constable off guard, shot him in the head. The Vietnamese constable, unprepared, died on the spot. When the bomb thrown at the Da Mei Bao printing press exploded, the workers in the machine room were unable to escape in time. Feng Zhengqing (34 years old, from Changzhou) was injured in the right foot. Zhou Yonglai (22 years old, from Yangzhou) a worker in the typesetting room, was injured in the left leg. Li Longgen (26 years old, from Pudong) was injured in the head. In addition, Wu Linsheng, a street vendor selling wontons at the corner of Avenue Edward VII and Sichuan Road, was grazed in the face by a bullet. The above four were not seriously injured, so they were sent to Renji Hospital by the Public Concession ambulance and discharged after a short dressing. The body of the Vietnamese constable who died was sent to the small mortuary on Route Tenant de la Tour by the French Concession police. The funeral is scheduled for 3:00 PM next Monday. A pedestrian named Chen Zhenqing (20 years old, from Beiping, wearing Western clothing) was injured by a stray bullet on the French Concession Bund. He went to Guangci Hospital for treatment afterwards. His injuries are said to be minor.</p>
<p>Police Attention</p>
<p>After the incident, the No. 18429 Xiang Sheng car hired by the thugs was found by the Public Concession Jing'an Temple police at around 8:00 AM yesterday morning. The tires had been punctured by bullets. Mr. Zhang, the driver, had also been released by the thugs and reported the robbery to the police. The authorities in both concessions attached great importance to this case. The key members of the French police personally investigated the matter. When the thugs escaped, one hand grenade was left behind on Rue du Consulat and has been taken away by the French police for inspection.</p>

<p>In order to facilitate passenger transport, the Ministry of Communications has decided to jointly manage land-air transport by the Eurasia Aviation Corporation, the Longhai Railway, and the Northwest Highway Bureau. Passengers depart from Xi'an by train every Tuesday to Baoji. This section is 173 kilometers long, and the journey takes six hours. The ordinary third-class ticket price is 3.22 yuan, the second class is doubled, and the first class is double that. Passengers taking special express trains must pay an express surcharge, which is calculated at 0.15 yuan per person for third class, 0.30 yuan for second class, and 0.60 yuan for first class for every 100 kilometers traveled. After arriving in Baoji, they stay overnight. On Wednesday, they take the Northwest Highway bus to Hanzhong, costing 18.30 yuan in national currency, and arrive on the same day. On Thursday, they take the Eurasia Aviation Corporation plane from Hanzhong to Chongqing, costing 370 yuan in national currency. The whole journey takes three days, which is much more convenient than going by land via Chengdu to Chongqing. Travelers from Chongqing heading north-west can take the first bus of the Northwest Highway Bureau to Baoji after arriving in Hanzhong by plane (no registration is required for purchasing tickets), and then take the train to Xi'an. The above method has been implemented since last month, and all travelers have praised its convenience.</p>
<h3 id="e72">No Definite Date for the Establishment of the Special Police Force; Donations and Taxes are in a Stalemate; Rumors that Xiao An is Trying to Control All Donations and Taxes; On Gambling Dens, He Claims "Gradual Elimination" <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Since the Public Works Department signed an "Agreement" with the puppet "Municipal Government" in February regarding the issue of extending roads beyond the settlement boundaries, the organization of the special police force has been discussed by the Chief Inspector of the Public Works Department, Bowen, and the Chief of the puppet "Police Bureau," Lu Yang, at weekly meetings. So far, the results of the past meetings are that Bowen has stated successively on the 23rd and 25th that "the negotiations between the two sides have reached a harmonious level" and that "some significant progress can be expected in the middle of next month." Therefore, there is a widespread rumor that the "special police" will be established in the middle of next month. The puppet side told Western reporters yesterday about the situation as follows:</p>
<p>Establishment Date</p>
<p>It is said that the "special police" issue for extending roads beyond the settlement boundaries has indeed made significant progress since the previous negotiations between the two sides. Therefore, it is predicted that the organization may be established by the middle of next month at the latest. This is the same as what the Chief Inspector of the Public Works Department, Bowen, stated. The establishment date has not yet been confirmed by either side. The two sides are still negotiating on the establishment of "special police" stations and the appointment of "special police" personnel. Currently, the puppet "Police Bureau" Chief Lu Ying is in Nanjing to attend the so-called "Celebration of Returning to the Ministry." The decision will be made after the two sides meet again after his return to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Puppet Side's Attempt to Control Donations and Taxes</p>
<p>It is rumored that Xiao An stated that the issue of collecting donations and taxes in the area where roads are extended beyond the settlement boundaries is indeed an important key in the negotiations between the two sides. However, this issue is planned to be negotiated only after the "special police" are established. In the past few years, donations and taxes in the area where roads are extended beyond the settlement boundaries have been collected by the Public Works Department. However, in the past few months, the puppet "Municipal Government" has also forcibly collected a part. Therefore, when reporters asked whether donations and taxes would still be collected separately by the two sides in the future, Xiao An resolutely stated that the collection of donations would be entirely under the control of the puppet side. The tax revenue would be entirely controlled by the "Special Police Bureau" to be used as funds for the establishment of the "Special Police Force" and for the operation of the area where roads are extended beyond the settlement boundaries. Neither the Public Concession nor the puppet "Municipal Government" want to interfere with this income.</p>
<p>No Determination to Eliminate Gambling Dens</p>
<p>It is said that gambling dens in the area where roads are extended beyond the settlement boundaries will be forced to close completely after the "special police" are established. However, the steps taken will be to "gradually eliminate" them. Therefore, it will take several months before the gambling dens in the area where roads are extended beyond the settlement boundaries can be completely eliminated. Finally, Xiao An said, "Although he has not made the customary visit to the new Chief of the Public Works Department, he believes that the relationship between the puppet side and the Public Works Department is still very harmonious." Finally, he boasted that his relationship with the consuls-general of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France in Shanghai was also very close.</p>
<h3 id="e73">Ninth Installment of Principal and Interest on the Unified Public Bonds; Payments to be Made in July; Lottery for Ding and Wu Type Bonds Scheduled <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>The five types of bonds (Jia, Yi, Bing, Ding, Wu) of the Unified Public Bonds of the Republic of China, 25th year, total 146 million yuan. The remaining amount from the customs duties, after deducting reparations and foreign debts, will be used for the principal and interest payments of these public bonds. The lottery for the 9th installment of principal repayment has been held by the National Debt Fund Management Committee in five phases starting in February. Now, except for the Jia, Yi, and Bing bonds, which have already been drawn, the Ding bonds are scheduled to be drawn on May 10th, and the Wu bonds are scheduled to be drawn on June 10th. The total amount of drawn bonds and due interest is 56,019,700 yuan, which will be paid by the Central Bank and its authorized Bank of China and Bank of Communications starting on July 31st. Since the Ministry of Finance temporarily suspended the payment of petty interest due to the interception of customs duties in the occupied areas, the four banks, the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications and Farmers Bank, have discounted payments to maintain creditworthiness. The payment methods will be announced by the Ministry at that time.</p>
<h3 id="e74">Inter-Port Trade Between Shanghai and the Mainland; Products Are in Great Demand; Exchange Rates are Extremely High <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, most factories in the mainland have ceased operations. Shanghai, due to its concession status, has been able to maintain a semblance of normalcy. Factories can continue to operate as usual, and products are sold at good prices because the mainland needs them and supply and demand are abnormal. Recently, due to the impact of the European war and exchange rate contraction, the mainland's demand for Shanghai products has become even more urgent. According to statistics obtained by the customs (this number is not usually released by the customs), the value of goods shipped from Shanghai to various domestic ports in March of this year was 47,571,180 yuan, mostly to the southwest and southern parts of the country. The value of goods purchased by Shanghai from various domestic locations was 28,979,617 yuan, resulting in a surplus of 18 million yuan. In the first quarter of this year, the value of goods exported from Shanghai to domestic ports was 151,841,835 yuan, and the value of goods shipped to Shanghai from other ports was 75,688,938 yuan, resulting in a surplus of 76 million yuan. Due to the balance of payments between ports, there is a high demand for remittances from other ports to Shanghai, so the exchange rate of Shanghai currency in other ports is quite high.</p>

<h3 id="e75">U.S. Fleet Gathered on the Shanghai Shore; American Residents Celebrate Mother's Day Early Today; American Families Entertain Naval Personnel <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>American residents in Shanghai will celebrate Mother's Day today. More than 50 American families will host lunch for the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps personnel. Traditionally, Mother's Day is celebrated on the second Sunday of May each year, which falls on May 12th this year. However, the Shanghai Naval YMCA chose to hold it early today to take advantage of the gathering of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet in Shanghai. Currently, the U.S. Asiatic Fleet stationed in Shanghai includes the flagship Augusta, as well as the gunboats Guam and Luzon, the submarine tender Canopus, the destroyer Lansdale, and six submarines. Therefore, U.S. Navy service personnel are gathered on the Shanghai shore.</p>
<p>Participation from Various Countries; It is reported that more than 200 people will attend the banquet today, making it a grand Mother's Day event. For the past 21 years, the Shanghai Naval YMCA has invited American families or families friendly to the United States to host lunch for U.S. Navy service personnel every Mother's Day. In addition to American families, families from countries such as Britain and Norway also participate. Mother's Day was initiated in 1904 by Professor Hilling of Indiana, USA. Each family participating in the banquet hosts two to seven Navy service personnel.</p>
<p>Reception Program; The U.S. Navy is scheduled to gather at the Naval YMCA on Sichuan Road at 10:30 AM today and be transported by Mack trucks to the social hall on Route Petain for worship. The U.S. Marine Corps will also finish worship at the Grand Theater at 11:30 AM and then proceed to the social hall to meet their Navy brothers. Then, they will all gather in the social hall plaza, where the YMCA staff will introduce them to the host families. They will be assigned to various homes for lunch. After lunch, the hosts will invite the guests to play games, watch movies, or drive to the Hongqiao area for a drive. It is also reported that the Naval YMCA will have a special program on May 11th, the actual day of Mother's Day.</p>

<p>Steele, the main Far East correspondent for the Chicago Daily News, and his wife, after traveling in Chongqing, went to Hong Kong to board a ship directly to the United States. Unexpectedly, the ship was temporarily delayed, so they switched to the President Pierce to return to the United States via Shanghai and Japan. Thus, they unexpectedly passed through Shanghai the night before last, staying for one night. Mr. and Mrs. Steele will still come to China in a few days.</p>
<h3 id="e77">British Ships Retain Original Status After Being Requisitioned; French Ships Sail as Usual; Only One French Ship on the Far East Line is Requisitioned; The British Government Does Not Interfere with the Business of British Ships; The Norwegian Ships Have Been Released and Have Sailed from Hong Kong to Shanghai <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war in Europe, British and French ships have been completely under the command of the Navy Department. Their schedules and routes are strictly kept secret. Therefore, British and French ships cannot move freely during navigation and must obey orders at any time. At the beginning of this month, the German army suddenly attacked Denmark and Norway, which made the European situation even more tense and serious. The British army also landed in Norway, and the French army and navy followed. Due to transportation needs, the French company's postal ship Athos, which runs on the Far East route, was requisitioned for military transport.</p>
<p>Only One French Ship Requisitioned; It was rumored in Shanghai a few days ago that French ships would be suspended. It has now been learned that only the Athos has been requisitioned among the French ships running on the Far East route. It is said that the others are sailing as usual. Therefore, one of the company's ships departed from Marseille last month (26th) and sailed to the Far East. Another ship will also depart from Marseille in the middle of next month. The first Norwegian ship to come to Shanghai after the resumption of navigation was the Talisman (translator's note), managed by the Da Xiang Yang Company, which arrived in Shanghai at about 4:00 PM yesterday. The Teitania is expected to arrive in Shanghai on Monday. The Prosper, managed by Dong Huiji, is expected to arrive in Shanghai at the end of the month and will sail from Shanghai to Hong Kong on the first of next month.</p>
<p>British Ships Do Not Leave the Far East for the Time Being; The merchant ships of the British Jardine Matheson and Taikoo Steam Navigation Companies, which operate on the coast of China, have been requisitioned by the British government for war purposes. However, they are still operating as usual in various ports. It is reported that the order to requisition ships will be implemented from the first of next month. In addition to the above two companies, other merchant ships operated by British merchants will also be requisitioned soon. According to the regulations on requisition, there will be no major changes, which is not as severe as rumored outside. According to senior officials of the two companies, the change is only nominal. In fact, the requisitioned ships will not leave the Far East. According to the British authorities, there are two methods for these ships: (1) All ships operated by British merchants are managed by the Navy Department and are subject to dispatch to the war zone to serve; (2) Technically, they are managed by the military authorities, but they are allowed to operate as usual.</p>
<p>Loading of Passengers and Cargo Remains the Same; The above two methods were recently ordered by the government. This means that although the ships are under the management of the government, the personnel and shipping affairs are still arranged by the companies themselves. Whether it is passengers or cargo, everything remains the same. The decision will be made based on the future political or military developments in Europe and Asia. It is very likely that the company's ships will stop operating due to being requisitioned for military purposes in the future. It is reported that there are more than 60 ships requisitioned. The two small ships of Jardine Matheson, the Lih Ho and Fook Ho, were requisitioned for military purposes last month and are currently serving in the Hong Kong and Singapore area.</p>
<p>Norwegian Cargo Ships Return to Shanghai One After Another; The Mainland Daily News reported that the Norwegian cargo ships in the Far East waters had been ordered by the British naval authorities to go to Hong Kong, but have now been released and have resumed navigation, and are allowed to load cargo to Shanghai. Those expected to arrive soon include the Norwegian oil tankers Basilea and Storsted, leased by Mobil Oil Company. The Basilea weighs 5,761 tons and was originally scheduled to arrive here on the 23rd of this month, but was detained in Hong Kong for several days, so it has been postponed to the 28th to come to Shanghai and will berth at the Pudong Mobil Wharf. The Norwegian cargo ship Talisman arrived in Shanghai on the morning of the 27th. When the Scandinavian war broke out, the ship secretly left Manila and sailed to Shanghai. It arrived at the outer anchorage of Wusong on the 14th of this month, but was seized by a British naval officer and escorted to Hong Kong, detained for several days, and finally allowed to return here. The Norwegian ship Prosper, leased by Jebsen &amp; Co., sailed from Saigon, was detained once, and then released. It is expected to arrive in Shanghai on the 28th.</p>
<p>Increased Wages for Loading and Unloading Cargo; The cargo handling workers at the Roosevelt Wharf, a U.S. company, have been hired by the American Labor Union. Recently, due to soaring prices and difficult living conditions, the wharf cargo handling workers have requested the company to allow them to increase the cargo handling wages from the customers. It is now known that the company has decided after discussion that it is true that life is difficult at a time of high prices. The original prices have been changed. The list of cargo names and cargo handling wages for each item has been listed and finalized. The new prices are two to three percent higher than before and have been sent to various shipping companies for notification and will be implemented from this month.</p>
<p>The Chichaglijka Arrives in Shanghai Today; The new mail ship Chichaglijka of the Java Company will arrive in Shanghai this time. According to the schedule, it will arrive in port on Monday (29th) of next week. It is now learned that the ship can arrive in Shanghai early this morning at 9:00 AM and berth at the Pootung Blue Funnel Wharf. There are 498 passengers. At about 10:00 AM, they will take a small boat prepared by the company to disembark at the New Customs Wharf. The mail ship will stay in Shanghai for two days and leave Shanghai for Xiamen on the 2nd of next month, passing through various ports in Hong Kong and Nanyang and returning to the mooring waters. The French mail ship Felix Roussel is expected to arrive in Shanghai at about 10:00 AM this morning and berth at the Shuntai Wharf in Hongkou. It is said that a large batch of foreign rice was loaded from Saigon.</p>

<p>After the Shanghai Banking Association submitted an application to the Ministry of Finance to issue aluminum subsidiary coins of one-fen and five-fen, the Bank Joint Reserve Committee, the Money Trade Joint Reserve, and the British Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation have distributed them to their member banks and money shops for circulation in the market. A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency inquired about this from the Banking Association yesterday. The aluminum was entrusted to the American Arctic Company for casting. According to the contract, the total amount is 50 million coins, half one-fen and half five-fen, totaling 1.5 million yuan in national currency. The first batch of 10 million coins and the second batch of 7 million coins have been issued successively. The third batch of about 10 million coins is expected to arrive in Shanghai early next week and will be distributed by the Banking Association to the silver and money trade reserve warehouses and the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation for distribution to various banks and money shops. If industries need aluminum coins, they can apply to their respective banks and money shops for a reasonable amount. There will be no more casting after this, and it will be determined based on market needs. Since the issuance of aluminum coins, the shortage of subsidiary coins in the Shanghai market has been alleviated, and citizens have generally praised its convenience.</p>

<p>The Sanshan Guild Hall Holds a Meeting and Decides to Console Wang Meihui</p>
<p>The Sanshan Guild Hall on Fuzhou Road is a group of Fujianese from Min. A board meeting was convened yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM. The chairman reported that the guild hall had repeatedly received letters and telegrams from the Minhou County Chamber of Commerce reporting the urgent need for rice relief in their hometown. In addition to the 1,973 bags of foreign rice that had been loaded onto the Shenyou ship last time, this ship, the Shenfu, was also allocated 1,730 bags of foreign rice transshipped from Hanjiang to the province to relieve the food shortage in their hometown. The meeting discussed and approved this, in addition to donating all the customs refund of the Shenfu ship, they would actively purchase more to relieve the food shortage and stabilize rice prices. Chen Runnan proposed that Wang Meihui, the chairman of the Minhou County Chamber of Commerce, has always been enthusiastic about local relief and disaster relief in their hometown. During this rice shortage, she has been working hard to seek relief and raising funds to come to Shanghai to assist in the purchase of rice to be transported to Min to provide food for the people and benefit the Rong territory, which is not a small feat. Reading the newspaper recently, there are many misunderstandings. Should they send a letter of condolence for discussion? Wu Hongshi, Huang Yu, Lai Gangshen, and Ximi's source of relief said that due to inconvenient transportation, the local supply has been abnormal and insufficient. They should send a letter to Wang Meihui, the chairman of the Minhou County Chamber of Commerce, to express their condolences and express their deep respect for this rice transport disaster relief, and ask her to continue to do her best to maintain relief for their hometown, and not to be discouraged by public opinion. The motion was passed, and the draft letter was handed over to the secretariat.</p>

<p>Impossible to Resume Next Month</p>
<p>Trolley routes 9, 8, and 1, and trackless trolley routes 21, 18, and 17 in the Hongkou district were suspended due to the special circumstances and difficulties in the area. Since the procedures for entering and leaving the area changed, the trolley company had sent representatives to contact the other side several times to discuss the possibility of resuming the trolley lines in the Hongkou area. It was also rumored that the above routes would be restored on May 1st. To clarify the truth, a reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency specifically interviewed the person in charge of the company yesterday to inquire about the resumption date and preparations for the Hongkou district trolley routes. According to the person in charge, although there had been several contacts to prepare for the resumption of trolley service in the Hongkou district, the negotiations had failed to make any headway, so the resumption of trolley service currently seems difficult.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Times reported that Colonel Xiang Pei, commander of the Shanghai International Settlement Volunteer Corps, Major General Simmons, commander of the British forces in Shanghai, Rear Admiral Grassford, commander of the British Yangtze Patrol Fleet, and Major Molante, commander of the Italian San Marco Marine Corps in Shanghai, visited Colonel Essoutier, the new commander of the French forces in Shanghai, at the French military headquarters on Avenue Albert on the morning of the 26th. From early morning, a French honor guard was stationed in the headquarters parade ground. When each commander arrived with his adjutant, they presented arms and saluted. Each commander was guided by Major Fleurendre, a French staff officer, to meet Colonel Essoutier. After exchanging pleasantries, they inspected the honor guard to the tune of music played by the French military band, and then took their leave.</p>
<h3 id="e82">The Japanese Economic Blockade Policy Has Been Broken Through: Spring Native Goods Exports Increase Sharply, Although the Coast is Blockaded, a New International Route is Opened, Native Goods Exports This Spring Double Compared to Last Year <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>After the export waterways of China's coastal areas were blockaded by Japanese warships, the export routes for various native products shifted with the development of the war. For example, tea and tung oil, in the early stages of the war of resistance, were mostly transported to Guangzhou via the Yuehan Railway, and then concentrated for export through the port. Later, due to the fall of Guangzhou, they were gradually transported to Beihai, Haikou, and other places, and exported through the port. Later, due to the Japanese blockade extending to the southern ports, Chinese native products changed course again to another international route in the southwest for export. The current export volume is not only not less than it was then, but has actually increased a lot. Taking the first quarter of this year as an example, the value of exported goods was 39,742,500 yuan, while in the same quarter last year it was 19,396,300 yuan, and in the same quarter of the year before last it was 13,416,200 yuan. Comparing these figures, the first quarter of this year increased by more than one time compared to last year, and by about two times compared to the year before last. From this, it can be seen that the Japanese dream of imposing an economic blockade on China has ultimately become a bubble. The value of native goods exported in the first quarter of this year was the highest for textiles and fibers, totaling 64,688,062 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e83">The Sorrowful Sounds of the People of Chaozhou City <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>The prefectures and counties of Chaozhou, since the Han and Tang dynasties, have been known for their customs and civilization, and were once called the "Lu of Zou" and the place where Changli passed through and transformed, and the area where Meishan preserved its spirit. However, due to the many mountains and swamps and the production of *zhe* and oranges, the yearly cultivation is insufficient for four months of food for the entire prefecture, which has a population of 100,000. Usually, food is mostly reliant on imports by sea. When scarcity occurs, it depends entirely on begging. Since last year, when the national army retreated from Chaozhou and Shantou, Chenghai successively fell. Alas, many of our people followed the army to relocate. However, those who fled the smoke of war lacked land to cultivate, and those who took refuge in the mountains and valleys suffered from miasma. Because they were not acclimatized, they could not find a place to live. Suffering from famine, how could they survive the year? Therefore, some reluctantly turned around and returned to their old homes, which is understandable and cannot be said to be abandoning it without patriotism. Recently, I received news from home that in the city, even rats and sparrows were being dug up and nothing was left. The grass and trees had been stripped bare. Matches were used as kindling, and even the matchsticks were being sold. Rough rice was relied upon to fill hunger, but each yuan could only buy ten *liang*. Searching for horse manure to wash and preserve the remaining grains to moisten the intestines. Many swallowed vegetable roots, accumulated frost and cold, and their feet swelled. Or their livers and gallbladders were burning, not knowing if they would live to see the next day. Or they stumbled on the road and died. There were even those who were driven by hunger and desperation and threw themselves into the river together, or those who, with their hearts burning with hunger, drank poison as a whole family. Alas, how tragic! Chaozhou is not a rice-producing area. Historically, the seaport was blocked, and there was suspicion of aiding the enemy if interior grain entered. Those who begged for food elsewhere in the hope of avoiding imminent death were labeled as spies. From then on, all hope for food was lost, and they died in this city of futility. The flames of war frightened them at night, and there was no hope for regeneration. When Yangcheng Li did not come to kill the horse to provide for the general, he heard that Zifan only had a good plan to save his own body. The heavens and earth wept, and the gods and ghosts were grieved. Remembering the past and present, iron and stone shed tears. I beg that the refugees at sea were still assisted by the Chinese and foreign. But the starving dead in Chaozhou has no benevolence and righteousness to paddle. Pity us in this remote area, originally the territory of the country. Why do the people in this place not have the descendants of Yixuan? Especially because the place involves the border and the news is scarce, and people are despised and abandoned. Calls are unheard, so the national authorities rarely take care of it, and benevolent people feel like they are abandoned. Comrades hear bad news from their hometown and have no tears to shed. Listening to the dying groans, their hearts are broken. Recently, fellow villagers in Shanghai, even though they have exhausted their meager efforts, are still only providing a drop in the bucket. Alas, this clothing customs and fear of this resistance and the other hindrance, even if the money is gathered, the skills of universal giving is scarce. All day long, running around, eagerly hoping that the people with disheveled hair and loose caps who are roaming around the room are waiting for friends who are willing to do what is right, thinking that charity has no national boundaries and is lacking in the sympathy of benevolent people. There are originally many righteous people in Lingnan, and I hope the National Government will also consider it so that a drop of sweet dew can save these lives and be like obtaining a soul return. I beg that people of good deeds at home and abroad will take pity on the Chaozhou refugees in Shanghai. Wenqi Announcement. The expense is from donations of good people.</p>

<h3 id="e84">Chinese Detective of the Jing'an Temple Police Station, Lu Gengsheng, Shot Dead: Ambushed by Thugs on Chengdu Road, Died of Serious Injuries from Four Gunshots, One Assailant Escaped in the Crowded City <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Lu Gengsheng, a Chinese detective at the Jing'an Temple Police Station in Shanghai, was 43 years old, from Nanjing. He had been with the police force for nearly 20 years, solving major cases and rising to his current position. When he was a deputy detective, he served in the police stations of Gordon Road, Huishan Road, and Laozha. After the August 13th Incident, he was transferred from the Laozha Police Station to the Jing'an Temple Police Station, where he has been for more than two years. His family lives on Nanyang Road. Yesterday afternoon at about 5:30 PM, Lu walked out from his mistress's place at a certain address on Chengdu Road and Dagu Road. Before he had taken a few steps, an assailant wearing a dark Western suit ambushed him from the side of the road. Seeing Lu Gengsheng approaching, without asking any questions, he drew his gun and fired six or seven shots, hitting Lu in the chest, abdomen, and other parts of his body with four bullets. Lu fell to the ground, bleeding profusely and barely breathing. At this time, a nearby street patrol officer heard the shots and rushed to pursue the assailant, firing one shot, but unfortunately missed. Because the area was very busy with many pedestrians and vehicles, the assailant escaped without a trace. The Chengdu Road Police Station was nearby. Soon after, a police car arrived and surrounded the area, but the assailant had disappeared. They inspected the scene and collected several discarded bullet casings left by the assailant for investigation, while also pursuing the killer. The injured Lu Gengsheng was taken to the Shanhai Pass Road Patrol Police Hospital by ambulance. Despite treatment, he died in the hospital at 6:30 PM.</p>

<p>Chen Zhaoxi (also known as Cai Shou), the owner of the Minyi Embroidery Company at No. 44, Lane 847, Tiantong Road, previously married a graduate of Guangxia Middle School, Miss Zai, and received much financial assistance from her. Chen had also borrowed 5,500 yuan from Miss Zai. Recently, Chen suddenly claimed that his shipping business had suffered too many losses and that he had to temporarily leave to avoid being pursued by creditors. Miss Zai believed him and returned to her mother's home in Ningbo. Unexpectedly, Miss Zai recently received a secret report stating that Chen was committing adultery with another woman at the Minyi Company. She hired lawyer Wu Linkun to report to the Huizha Police Station, who ordered detective Xu Huanqing to arrest them. Chen and another woman, Jin Suhua, were indeed arrested. After investigation, it was learned that Jin was originally Chen's first wife. After Chen met Miss Zai, knowing that Zai had some savings, he falsely divorced Jin and married Miss Zai in order to obtain her financial assistance. Now, he deliberately created a ruse to achieve his goal of reuniting with Jin. The police lawyer Peng Qiqi legally sued him in the First Special District Court. Because Chen and Jin failed to appear in court, the court issued a warrant for their arrest. Later, it was reported that Chen Yi had been arrested and sent to the Special Court. Miss Zai, represented by lawyer Wu Linkun, filed a civil suit, requesting the court to order Chen to pay 5,000 yuan in damages. This case was heard yesterday by Judge Zhan Liangce, who sentenced Chen to five months of imprisonment for adultery. If he chooses to pay a fine in lieu of imprisonment, it would be at the rate of three yuan per day. He was also ordered to pay Wang Man 2,000 yuan in damages.</p>

<p>According to the *North-China Daily News*, at about 3 PM on the 26th, a seven-year-old Chinese child was playing with two other children by the river near Quessant Road and Zhao Le Road when he accidentally fell into the river. At that time, the tide was rising, and the child was quickly swept into the middle of the river. Fortunately, Mr. Gong Safu, an 18-year-old Portuguese youth residing at No. 294 Yuyuan Road, was passing by. Hearing the child's cries for help, he rushed to the riverbank. Seeing the situation, he did not hesitate and jumped into the river without removing his clothes and shoes, quickly rescuing the child and bringing him ashore. At this time, the child was still frightened and ran home. Mr. Gong also returned to his residence to change clothes. It is reported that Mr. Gong is a good swimmer and skilled in boxing. On the 18th of this month, he participated in a Boy Scout boxing performance at the YMCA.</p>

<p>The late Chief Inspector of the Political Department of the French Concession Police Force, Cheng Haitao, was assassinated on the morning of October 18th last year while going to the police station from his home to work. He left behind his elderly father, Cheng Changsheng (former Detective No. 6 of the French Police Force), his middle-aged widow, Liu (28 years old, from Jiangwan), and two sons, Wanli and Qianli, from his previous wife Shen. After mediation by relatives and friends, Cheng's estate was estimated.</p>
<p>Estate estimate</p>
<p>The estate was divided equally between the two sons and the stepmother Liu, and Liu moved out to live separately. All of Liu's dowry remained with her. The two sons, Wanli and Qianli, were cared for by Cheng's father, Cheng Fusheng. Both parties signed a property division agreement, which was certified by lawyer Jin Yu. Now, Cheng Liu has moved out to No. 38 Hengmaoli, Baxianqiao, to live separately, but because her father-in-law refuses to pay the share.</p>

<p>She has been unable to receive the property. After several unsuccessful attempts to have someone mediate, Cheng Liu hired lawyer Fang Gang to file a petition with the Civil Court of the Second Special District Court against her father-in-law, Cheng Fusheng, to perform the contract. The court accepted the petition, and yesterday afternoon, Judge Yang Delin presided over the mediation at the Fourth Court. The opposing party, Cheng Fusheng, arrived at the court with lawyer Peng Qixiu, but did not report his appearance, so only the petitioner Cheng Liu and her lawyer were present to state</p>
<p>Reasons for the petition</p>
<p>After reviewing the case, the court announced that mediation was unsuccessful due to the absence of the opposing party and ordered that a formal lawsuit be filed. Cheng Fusheng, also in the capacity of legal representative, filed a lawsuit with the Civil Court of the Second Special District Court on behalf of his grandsons Cheng Wanli and Cheng Qianli against Cheng Liu for concealing the inheritance of the deceased husband and disregarding the lives of the two grandsons and the frail elderly, requesting that she return the inheritance. The court will be hearing the case soon.</p>

<p>Dai Heshang, from Jiangbei, was engaged in the business of selling morphine. He set up a drug trafficking den in Hongyunfang, Kai'erzi Road. Dai used Yang Chunlin, nicknamed "Little Yang", a former police officer who had been dismissed from his job, as his lookout. He also employed Zhang Zhenbao, an unemployed young man, to specialize in sales. Daily business was no less than several tens of yuan. The matter was detected by the police. On the previous day, Zhang was arrested and 35 packets of morphine and 7 yuan in cash were confiscated. He was taken to the police station and confessed that Dai Heshang and Yang Chunlin were the masterminds. They were arrested at their addresses. After investigation, they were escorted to the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court yesterday afternoon, where Judge Liao presided over the interrogation. Dai and Yang's testimonies were evasive. Zhang Zhenbao confessed to selling morphine. After reviewing the testimonies, the court announced the end of the debate and set the sentencing for the 30th.</p>
<h3 id="e90">The Zhengyi Club Sues for Relocation, Demands a 300% Rent Increase, the Defendant Counterclaims Based on the Contract <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>The premises of the Zhengyi Club on the sixth floor of the Cishu Building on Nanjing Road were originally leased from the Continental Bank. The original rent was 780 yuan, which was later reduced to 400 yuan per month for a five-year term. The ownership of the premises has now been transferred from the Continental Bank to the Hadong Foreign Firm. The foreign firm has notified all tenants that the rent must be increased by 30%, while the rent increase for the Zhengyi Club must be increased to 300%, i.e., the monthly rent would be changed from 400 yuan to 1,600 yuan. Because the Zhengyi Club refused, the Hadong Foreign Firm sued the Zhengyi Club for relocation to the First Special Court on the grounds that the lease had expired. The Zhengyi Club, represented by lawyer Zou Yu, stated that according to the lease, the defendant had the right of first refusal, and that the defendant had made tens of thousands of dollars of renovations to the premises, and that the Hadong Foreign Firm's rent increase notice to other tenants was 30%, while the rent increase for the defendant was 300%, which was obviously unreasonable. Therefore, it filed a counterclaim, requesting that the rent be increased by 21% in accordance with the lease. Yesterday, Judge Wang Qufei held a hearing on the case. The defendant Zhengyi Club stated that if there was a possibility of settlement, the Zhengyi Club was willing to increase the rent to 800 yuan, but because the Hadong Foreign Firm still did not agree, the hearing proceeded. Judge Wang then ordered the defendant to pay the counterclaim litigation fee and adjourned the hearing.</p>

<p>Yu Yushan, a local resident, met Xie Lianping, the daughter of Xie Zhuangdou from Anhui, last year. At first, they only exchanged visits, but then entered a stage of love. In February of this year, they held an engagement ceremony at the Jiaobao D饭店. However, after the engagement, Yu suddenly discovered that Miss Xie had committed a disreputable incident, stealing a diamond ring and being arrested by the French police. Since Xie had this fact, Yu found it difficult to spend his life with her. He hired lawyer Tu Kunfan to file a lawsuit in the Second Special District Court to terminate the engagement. Xie, also through her mother, Ms. Huang, filed a lawsuit in the First Special District Court against Yu for interfering with the family, accusing Yu of enticing and committing adultery with her three times. She requested that he be punished in accordance with Articles 229 and 240 of the Criminal Law and filed a civil suit, demanding 50,000 yuan in damages. Yu still hired lawyer Tu Kunfan to defend him, denying that he had committed adultery with her and requesting a verdict of not guilty. This case has been concluded by the First Special District Court. Yesterday morning, Judge Meng Tingke held a court session to announce the verdict: Yu Yushan was found not guilty, and the plaintiff's accompanying civil lawsuit was dismissed.</p>

<p>He Jingtian and Ding Ziying, shareholders and managers of the Zhengfeng Dongji Sugar Firm at No. 17, Yong'an Street, French Concession, filed a lawsuit last year against Mei Shaoxiong, the firm's business director in Guangdong and Guangxi provinces, for breach of trust and embezzlement of more than 700,000 yuan in funds. The two parties were involved in litigation for many years. Until recently, the two parties reconciled amicably through mediation. Mao Xianshen, the lawyer representing He Jingtian et al., appeared in court for them in more than ten cases. The two parties agreed on a public fee of 8,900 yuan. After deducting the amount paid by He, 2,450 yuan was still owed. After lawyer Mao repeatedly demanded payment, He et al. ignored him. Therefore, he filed a lawsuit with the Civil Court of the Second Special District Court. Judge Li Liang once summoned the defendants for a hearing, but they did not appear. After one-sided debate, the case was scheduled for pronouncement yesterday. The main text said: He Jingtian et al. should transport and pay the plaintiff 2,400 yuan in national currency. The litigation fee will be borne by the defendants. (Huaguang Agency)</p>
<h3 id="e93">Letter <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Dear Editor, Having read the news in today's edition regarding Mrs. Yan Zhonghanfen (i.e., Yan Zhongshi) committing suicide by taking poison, it does not conform with the facts. Mrs. Yan Zhonghanfen is the eldest daughter-in-law of Yan Jiazhuo (i.e., Junshu). Since her husband, Yan Zhiqian, passed away in the spring of the 25th year of the Republic of China, she has been determined to maintain her chastity. Her father-in-law has not provided for her, and she was forced to take her daughter, Qingyi, and temporarily return to her mother's home. She once filed a lawsuit in Suzhou for maintenance. The case has gone through two trials and is currently in the third trial. In March of this year, Hanfen hired this lawyer as her legal advisor. Because the cost of living has been rising recently, it is difficult for the mother and daughter to maintain their livelihood. She entrusted this lawyer to send a letter to Mr. Yan Junshu requesting support and discussing a solution, but was rejected by letter. Hanfen, pressured by the environment, became ill with anger. Unexpectedly, on the afternoon of the 26th of this month, she took medicine in an attempt to end her life. She is currently being treated in the hospital. We respectfully request that you correct the information to reflect the truth. We hope you will take this into consideration. Yours sincerely, Lawyer Dong Duanshi, April 27th.</p>

<p>The Monk Risked His Life to Solicit Donations (2)</p>
<p>After the two county officials inspected, they returned by sedan chair. At that time, those who believed in the monk secretly blamed the county officials for being meddlesome. In a short while, half of the people left, and half remained. However, there were still no less than several hundred people worshiping from the viewing platform, sitting on the side platform, and wiping away tears while seeing them off, all saying that ascension was imminent and that the opportunity was rare, all妄想to be Liu An's chickens and dogs. Unexpectedly, at noon on the 17th, there was a turning sound in the niche, and the crowd was quite surprised. Suddenly, there was a loud vibration, the niche door opened wide, and the living Buddha was truly alive. The men and women under the stage fled in shock, and his disciples were also speechless, looking up at the niche, seeing the old monk's feet had already stretched straight out of the niche, beckoning a disciple to help him down. His disciples were surprised that their master had not died and abandoned their previous efforts. The master blamed his disciples for not burning him and causing a change in the middle, and they resented each other. The constable on duty took out the handcuffs and arrested the master and disciples, and they rushed into the city to report to the officials for disposition. When the county official heard that the monk had come back to life, he couldn't help but laugh and immediately ordered the master and disciples to be questioned. The old monk first kowtowed and begged for forgiveness, claiming: "This poor monk is seventy-six years old. In order to donate to repair the temple foundation, there was no way to beg for donations, so I risked my life to accomplish a good deed. First, I borrowed the name of becoming a Buddha. Second, I borrowed it as a meeting to collect money. Third, I established a long-term career for my disciples. If my soul has knowledge, it will not be as hungry as Ruo Ao." As for the method of causing death, he obtained a strange pill, and after taking it, people would be unconscious, but they would still wake up after three days and nights. Therefore, on the 15th, he sat in the niche and took the medicine, and it was scheduled to be cremated on the 16th. After speaking, he kowtowed and wept. The county official, thinking that he was old and pitying his foolishness, and also seeing that he was actually starting a temple, which was different from those who were collecting money to fund illicit wealth, should not be convicted of deceiving people with heresy. Therefore, he was given a light sentence and no corporal punishment was added. Also, fearing that there were any untruths or omissions, he separated and investigated his disciples. The confessions were the same. After rebuking them, they were released together.</p>

<h3 id="e96">How to Choose Games <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>— Wan</p>
<p>Children are all active and don't like to be quiet. They jump and run all day long without a moment to sit still. If they are quiet, it is either because they are feeling unwell, or they are always active all day long, especially on "Saturday and Sunday," when homes, whether small or large, become temporary playgrounds. When I am free, I often walk around the alleys and often see groups of children playing. What are they playing? Probably dribbling a ball, skipping rope, playing marbles, spinning tops, kicking a ball, and in early spring, flying kites, kicking shuttlecocks, etc., changing from time to time depending on gender, season, interest, and age. However, the problem is that they don't know how to choose, which games are beneficial to play, and which games are not.</p>
<p>In school, during physical education class, we have some time for games. Sometimes the teacher teaches new ones, and sometimes the students think of new ones themselves. Because there are many people, the objects to play with are limited, so the way of playing is different from what we do at home. Since games have such a close relationship with children, they must have considerable value. They can make the body move, help digestion, promote development, and in terms of character, they can cultivate a spirit of teamwork, cultivate habits of self-government and discipline, and at the same time make our thinking flexible and our actions agile. If we can choose properly, then it will enable us to develop in all aspects, otherwise, it will hinder our development. Now, let's give an example to prove the impact of bad games on the body.</p>
<p>There was a child who liked to play marbles very much. Every day after lunch, he would invite a few classmates to dig a few holes in the mud and start playing. Whoever hit the other's marbles would win one. Over time, it seemed to develop into gambling. If he won, he would laugh heartily, and if he lost, he would want to win it back. So he played every day, and his fingers and clothes were always covered in mud. He continued to play like this for a long time. Suddenly, one day, the child's stomach started to hurt, and it hurt very badly. His family was worried and sent him to the hospital. After the doctor examined him, he said that his appendix was inflamed. So he underwent surgery and suffered a lot of pain before recovering, but his body was much weaker than before.</p>
<p>After reading the above facts, we know that games must be chosen. Anything that has a gambling nature, a dangerous nature, or a tricky nature is not acceptable. The most important condition for our choice is that it is beneficial to us, such as being able to promote health, develop thinking, and cultivate good habits. Secondly, we focus on interest. Why do I say this? Because children used to only focus on interest and did not think about their bodies, so we must change our concept in the future.</p>
<p>Games are a right that children should enjoy, so children must make full use of them, choose appropriately, and enable us to obtain true value in games.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Children and Labor Day <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Chunlv</p>
<p>May 1st is International Labor Day.</p>
<p>The origin of Labor Day: In 1886, American workers, unwilling to suffer abuse and exploitation by capitalists, united to demand that of the 24 hours in a day, 8 hours be for work and 8 hours be for education. This reduction in working hours for workers would decrease the profits of capitalists, and they naturally refused. Therefore, on May 1st of that year, workers in Chicago, the industrial center of the United States, held a strike demonstration because their demands were not met, gathering more than 60,000 workers to march. They clashed with the police on the street, and many workers were shot and killed by the police, and the leaders were arrested. Among them, four were hanged.</p>
<p>However, this great sacrifice awakened workers around the world who were living a life of slavery. In 1889, the International Socialist Party, recognizing that the demands of the workers were justified and should not be subjected to such unreasonable oppression, convened a meeting of world labor organizations in Paris, France, and designated this day as "International Labor Day." The "Labor Law" also stipulated that workers should work eight hours a day, and capitalists should not arbitrarily extend workers' working hours. This was a victory won by the workers through their own struggle.</p>
<p>Chinese workers first celebrated this "May Day" in 1920. Although commemorative activities were held every year on this day, after the outbreak of the War of Resistance, many factories closed down or suspended operations, resulting in tens of thousands of unemployed workers, who were practically starving to death.</p>
<p>Now, "May Day" is about to pass before our eyes again. Dear children! You are all young workers of the revival of the Chinese nation. Hurry, work hard to seize your path to survival!</p>

<p>Geller hastily said, "Oh, how can you be so heartless?" The King of the Golden River, Wang Boran, said, "Heartless? They pour that unholy water into my river. How can I tolerate such disrespect?" Geller anxiously said, "How can it be unholy? I know they took it from the baptismal font in the chapel." The King of the Golden River became even more solemn and said, "That is true, but they were unwilling to use this water to save those who were about to die of thirst, humans and animals. Therefore, it is unholy. Even if it has been blessed by all the great saints, it cannot be considered holy water. Only that which comes from a compassionate thought is holy. Even if it has been soaked in corpses, it cannot defile it." On it hung three clear, transparent drops of dew. He dripped them into the water bottle in Geller's hand and then said, "You put this into the river and immediately rush down the other side of the mountain. You should then be able to get to Hundred Treasures Valley. Hurry up and go."</p>
<p>Having said this, his short figure suddenly became blurred, and his flesh-colored robe seemed to turn into a light white mist. He stood for a while, as if a rainbow ribbon had scattered. The color gradually faded, the mist rose into the air, and the King of the Golden River had vanished.</p>
<p>Geller stared blankly for a long time, feeling very disappointed. It turned out that he saw that the river water had not turned into gold, but it had decreased a little. However, he still obeyed the short king's words and climbed down the other side of the mountain, heading towards Hundred Treasures Valley. As he walked, he seemed to hear the sound of running water underground. When he saw Hundred Treasures Valley, he saw a river like the Golden River rushing out of a rock above, dividing into countless small streams, flowing over piles of dry red sand.</p>
<p>While Geller was looking around curiously, new grass grew by the new stream, vines climbed all over the moist soil, and small, delicate flowers bloomed one by one, very brightly colored. At this time, dusk was approaching, the stars filled the sky, and clumps of goosefoot and strands of ivy filled Hundred Treasures Valley with shadows. Thus, Hundred Treasures Valley was transformed into a paradise once more, and the property that had been lost due to cruelty was now restored due to benevolence.</p>
<p>Geller was still in Hundred Treasures Valley. Whenever poor people came to his door, they never returned empty-handed. His granaries were filled with grain, and his house was filled with treasures. This was just as the short king had promised him, and it had turned into the Golden River.</p>
<p>Even today, the residents of the valley always point out the place where the three drops of holy water fell, which is the source of the underground Golden River, leading directly to Hundred Treasures Valley. And in the rapids of the Golden River above, one can still see two black stones. When the setting sun is in the west, the flowing water always weeps there. Everyone calls these two black stones the Black Brothers. (The End) are filled with a strange feeling of boredom, especially the children, who like to go outdoors to play. Even if there are fun games in the house, they are generally unwilling to stay indoors to play. Moreover, these few days have been so warm, and the spring breeze seems to be massaging the face, making one feel exceptionally comfortable.</p>
<p>Today is Sunday again, and A'hui is naturally no exception. He doesn't want to hide at home, and wants his older brother to accompany him to Zhaofeng Park, not far from their home, to play. A'ming initially showed an unhappy expression, but later, for some reason, he became happy.</p>
<p>After finishing breakfast, the two of them got on a bus and arrived at their destination in no time. There were especially many tourists, because it was a holiday and the weather was warm. The tourists at the entrance kept coming, with the potential to fill up such a large park. The two brothers stepped into the entrance of the park and immediately saw a large expanse of lawn, already covered in tender green clothing, and piles of colorful flowers smiling at people, making one feel suddenly cheerful and exceptionally happy. They chose a quiet spot to rest for a while.</p>
<p>"Bang! Bang! Bang..." A sudden, ear-piercing gunshot struck A'hui's heart sharply.</p>
<p>"That's the sound of foreign soldiers practicing shooting." A'ming already knew that his younger brother was frightened, so he quickly comforted him. Hearing this, A'hui's tense emotions eased. He had thought that something unexpected had happened.</p>
<p>"The shooting range is very close to us here, it seems to be over there, otherwise it wouldn't be so loud." A'hui pointed in that direction, muttering to himself.</p>
<p>"Actually, it's not as close as you say, it's quite far away. Because our ears, upon hearing a gunshot, don't have the ability to determine its distance, but can clearly distinguish the direction from which the gunshot came. The direction you pointed just now wasn't bad. Sounds coming from the left or right are easiest to distinguish. If the sound occurs directly in front of us or behind us, it's not easy to identify its source. Because sounds emitted in front of us often travel from behind. Speaking of this, it reminds me of an interesting game—testing the source of sound." A'ming said, stopping there. A'hui naturally wanted his older brother to test him, but how could they test it in the park? So they decided to go back home to test it, and as a result, A'hui had no interest in sightseeing. The two of them circled the park once and then went back.</p>
<p>As soon as they got home, A'ming led his younger brother to the attic, tightly closing the doors and windows. He blindfolded A'hui with a towel, who thought his brother was joking with him, playing hide-and-seek. Who would be happy to play that? Then he told him to sit down and not move, not even to turn his head. A'ming found two pieces of hard board, placed them apart on the ground, spaced apart in front of and behind A'hui's head, and asked him to distinguish where the wooden boards were being knocked. He clearly pointed in the opposite direction to the actual direction, that is, the sound occurred on this side, but he pointed to that side. When he was allowed to turn his head, he accurately pointed to the place where the wooden board was being knocked. A'hui obviously didn't believe this, so he asked A'ming to sit down and test him again. It was completely correct, there was indeed such a phenomenon.</p>
<p>A'ming then said, "When we hear a sound, don't turn our heads first, towards the direction of the sound, but rather towards the opposite direction of the sound, and then we can determine the exact direction from which the sound is coming. This is also how we cultivate the habit of remaining calm when encountering things."</p>

<h3 id="e100">How I Take Notes on Dramas — and Please Instruct Me, Experts <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>— De</p>
<p>Before reading, the author (or translator) looks up literary dictionaries and literary history in order to understand the author's life, their status in literary history, and the position of the play in the author's works, the date of production, and the influence it had on the literary world at the time, making a brief biography.</p>
<p>Plot: A drama is not just a drama, but every story is parasitic in a very good story. This story is a fragment selected by the author from their entire life, capable of starting and ending on its own and explaining the "theme" that they have used. Therefore, after reading the entire play, I use my own words to write down the story in summary.</p>
<p>Setting, Dramatic Form, and Dramatic Nature: The setting is the location and scenery presented to the audience when the drama is performed, such as props, background, lighting, etc. Dramatic form refers to the form of the drama, such as whether it is a one-act play or a four- or five-act play. Dramatic nature is the atmosphere contained in the entire drama, such as whether it is humorous, mysterious, terrifying, or happy, sad. I use my own words to describe the former, and examine the latter two, adding a brief judgment. It would be even better if I could name the school to which the play belongs.</p>
<p>Action: In a script, the characters inevitably perform actions. Here, I must study and explain why they are doing this? Why can't they not do this?</p>
<p>Climax: The climax is the most tense point in the development of the drama. Usually, it is at the end, but there are many exceptions; and there are also dramas with more than one climax. However, the other climaxes only serve to enhance the power of the main climax.</p>
<p>Characters: Here, I often observe the more important characters, recording their psychology, thoughts, characteristics, personality, etc., paying particular attention to the changes in their character, the transformation of their thoughts, etc., and adding a little criticism.</p>
<p>Dialogue: Dialogue not only tells the audience the story or plot of the drama, but also expresses the characters' personalities, conveys thoughts, and emotions. I often choose well-crafted dialogues, copy a few sentences, and explain their benefits, so that I can become proficient in my own dialogue skills, and at the same time, I can become proficient in my own scriptwriting skills (but a well-crafted skill is not necessarily a good script).</p>
<p>Thoughts After Reading: Finally, I write down my criticisms and feelings about the play, discussing all aspects such as skills and descriptive thoughts. I may as well copy and narrate the comments of major writers and critics on the play, because that can help me understand the drama.</p>
<p>Finally, with twelve points of sincerity, I hope that experts will instruct me on better methods. I am writing this with the intention of "throwing a brick to attract jade."</p>

<p>Premiered in Nanjing and Shanghai</p>
<h3 id="e102">Talking About the Story of "The Lock of the Unicorn" <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>— Ji</p>
<p>The new play compiled by Cheng Yanqiu is the most numerous and most appealing among the four famous operas. Such as the previous plays "The Jade Hairpin," "Mandarin Duck Tomb," "Biography of the Red Buddha," and "Green Frost Sword," all of which left a deep impression on people. "The Lock of the Unicorn" is his recent new play.</p>
<p>Before talking about "The Lock of the Unicorn," we must first have a kind of understanding of all of Yanqiu's past new plays. What must be said is that these plays that he has compiled and arranged are popular but not of low taste. Although his plays are more easily welcomed by ladies, this is precisely the power of the script. They are popular with the masses while having profound consciousness, but there is absolutely no "private determination of lifelong love" or "prince in distress," such unbearably vulgar tricks.</p>
<p>The plot of the play "The Lock of the Unicorn" is rich in emotion. The general idea is that a rich young lady unintentionally saves a poor girl and gives her the lock of the unicorn, which originally contained jewels. The poor girl firmly asks the rich young lady for her name in order to repay her in the future, but the rich young lady answers that she gave food to Han Xin, not for repayment. The girl asks again and again, so the rich young lady gives her the lock of the unicorn as a memento. Years later, floods cause disaster, and the rich young lady's family is scattered and displaced. A wealthy family sets up a porridge shop to help the poor, and the rich young lady begs for porridge. The owner of the porridge shop pities her and keeps her as a nanny. Under certain circumstances, the rich young lady who is working as a nanny discovers the lock of the unicorn that she gave away years ago in the owner's house, and knows that the current madam is the poor girl she saved before. At the same time, this wealthy family is praying day and night for the safety of their benefactor, who has suffered in the flood, and is distributing porridge on a large scale to create fortune for their benefactor. They meet unexpectedly, and the joy is beyond words. The nanny is transformed into a guest of honor. Later, the rich young lady's family is reunited. The general plot of this play is just like this, but its main point is that doing good brings good fortune, and receiving kindness leads to gratitude. In today's world, it should be said that "this kind of script is needed."</p>
<p>Finally, what is worth introducing is that Yanqiu has many new contributions in terms of singing style in this play, such as the crying head in the Er Liu Ban. This play is scheduled to premiere next week. I will make a judgment on its performance after I have seen it.</p>
<h3 id="e103">Interesting Snippets from the Creation of "The Adventures of Pinocchio" <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>— Bomin</p>
<p>I have found some interesting snippets about "The Adventures of Pinocchio" that are worth mentioning.</p>
<p>"The Adventures of Pinocchio" is a fairy tale written by the Italian Lorenzini, whose pen name was Collodi. Originally, Collodi was the name of the village where Lorenzini lived in his childhood. The puppet is called "Pinocchio," and its meaning is "a little boy made of pine wood."</p>
<p>Walter Disney, who voiced the little puppet, recruited a hundred boys and selected Dickie Jones from among them.</p>
<p>In Collodi's fairy tale, a little cricket acts as Pinocchio's "conscience," warning the little puppet not to cause himself trouble. Walt Disney initially wanted to use a termite to replace the little cricket, because Pinocchio was a little puppet, but in the end he decided to use the little cricket. However, it was extremely difficult to draw various expressions on the little thing's face.</p>
<p>Walt Disney employed 1,200 staff members when creating this film, using 450,000 drawings. The inking and coloring department employed 200 girls, because women have more patience when doing delicate work, so these girls were mostly responsible for the inking and coloring work.</p>
<p>There are many sounds in this film that are very difficult to match, such as the neighing of the seahorse, the whistling of the whale, and the sound of the whale tossing and turning in the sea when it is burned and angry, the sound of the little puppet and the little cricket talking underwater, and the answer of the pendulum when it is happy and sad. When drawing the great whale Monstro, a five-foot-long tame whale was used as a model. Although the work was difficult, it was all cleverly successful.</p>

<p>Zhang Wenjuan will perform Hong Zong Lie Ma at the Guangde Theater on the evening of the 22nd, and she is famous throughout Shanghai. The posters have been posted, and the seats are being booked very enthusiastically. From this, we can see the value of Wenjuan in this play.</p>
<p>On the 18th day of the third lunar month, the entire Peking Opera troupe worshiped the gods, led by Shang Xiaoyun, Zhao Yankui, and Zhong Zhang, still held at the National Opera Professional Branch on Cherry Blossom Slanting Street. With the consent of the classes, everything was saved. On this day, representatives from each class offered sacrifices, as usual, and Fudacheng Troupe would sing Xiao Changbi's advocated Wanguo Lai Han, and could sing Su Qin Six Kingdoms Prime Minister (the play is scheduled).</p>
<p>Zhang Xiangjun, a talented student of Xiao Cuihua, has recently been working hard in Tianjin to study and improve her theatrical skills and is progressing very quickly. She will perform at the Tianbao Theater.</p>
<p>There are only two pure spoken drama troupes in Beiping and Tianjin: (1) the Tianjin Professional Touring Drama Troupe, and (2) the Beijing Drama Club, which are respectively rehearsing famous plays such as "Sunrise" and "Wilderness."</p>

<p>— Written by Dongyun, Illustrated by Xiuyan</p>
<p>"Miss Lu Qingyun": During the Zhengde period of the Ming Dynasty, Lu Qi, the dismissed general's daughter, accidentally dropped a mud-gilded folding fan while offering incense in the Buddha hall. It just so happened that a passionate young man, Zhou Xuewen, picked it up. At that time, the Lu family was organizing a team of "female actors," and Zhou Xuewen used this as a means to advance his career, changing his appearance and entering the Lu family to learn acting. He was transferred to the boudoir, returned the fan, and courted her, and got Miss Qingyun's lifelong love."</p>
<p>The plot of "The Fallen Golden Fan" is quite complex, but it is all based on the general storytelling ballad with "talented scholars and beautiful ladies" as the central figures.</p>

<h3 id="e106">Where is Japan's Diplomacy Going? <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>— Fang Qi</p>
<p>Diplomacy Occupies a Subordinate Position</p>
<p>There are two sentences in Japanese newspapers that describe Abe's position: "The dispatched envoy is not an envoy of peace, and the ambassador's mission is to echo the Japanese army's operations." These two sentences can not only describe Abe, but also broadly portray Japan's diplomacy, which has already fallen under the command of the sword. The correspondence between Japanese diplomacy and Japanese military affairs has a long history. However, it is quite easy for the commanded to do the corresponding work, but when it comes to needing to shout, it often becomes the dumb character being sold in a change-of-face play. Not only does he not know much about the operational situation, but the commander's sword itself does not know which direction to swing, so there is often the suffering of not knowing what to say.</p>
<p>Opportunism in International Politics</p>
<p>Before the German-Soviet Pact, Japan often used the slogan of war against the Soviet Union to reap benefits in many ways. At advantageous times, it had also launched two seemingly real wars against the Soviet Union as a test. But because it only seemed real in fact, the diplomatic correspondence also failed to shout loudly. After the German-Soviet Pact, it finally could only put aside the anti-Soviet slogan with the Nomonhan Armistice Agreement, waiting for new developments. In this situation, the war could be stopped, but the diplomatic correspondence still had to be maintained. Therefore, it humbly sought to approach the Soviet Union, while claiming to the United Kingdom and the United States that it was being wooed by the Soviet Union to intimidate them. It hoped that the Anti-Comintern Pact, which had died in vain, would be revived and was still holding on to it. If one of the three expressions is true, it just proves that the other two are all false. The relevant parties in the first two items did not try to figure out whether their expression was true or false, so it had no opportunity to explain, and it seemed that there was still an opportunity to prove the third item. Currently, Italy's attitude is gradually becoming clear, and Japan will naturally take this opportunity to express its operational plan. However, Italy is indeed standing in an uneasy situation of wanting to oppose both the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom. What it can decide recently will still not be choosing one side between the two, so it still cannot make a choice for Japan, and what Japan can do is still just wait.</p>
<p>Intimidation of the United Kingdom</p>
<p>Naturally, it is very possible that Japan will simply decide to adopt an anti-British direction from Italy's anti-British expression. However, the reaction that this can cause on the British side is also very limited. If the United Kingdom believes that this can create danger, it would of course rather make concessions to Italy first to preserve the more valuable Far East and India, and Italy would also get to reap a bit of the effect of intimidation first and temporarily not resort to force. Then Japan would only remain in its original position. As for whether the United Kingdom does not value Italy's military force, it would be confident that when the Mediterranean problem is resolved, major changes will still not occur in the Far East. The naval exercises of the Italian Navy in the Mediterranean have received considerable attention from both the United Kingdom and France, but the naval exercises of the Japanese Navy in the China Seas do not seem to be worth consulting by the United Kingdom and France. This hint seems to be enough to sweep away Japan's pride in considering itself as important as Italy, so Japan's old methods towards the United Kingdom will not suddenly see results for a while. In addition, even if the United Kingdom is willing to compromise with Japan, how reliable is Japan after all? If the United Kingdom is generous and compromises with Japan, how unfavorable will the displeasure of the United States cause the United Kingdom to suffer? These are still issues that do not need to be considered for the time being.</p>
<p>A Deadlock Between Japan and the United States That Cannot Be Broken</p>
<p>From the British perspective, the attitude of the United States is a secondary issue, but from the Japanese perspective, the attitude of the United States is the most important issue. The United States can consider the pro-Japanese stance of the United Kingdom as not being anti-American, but it will definitely consider Japan's anti-British stance as being anti-American. However, if Japan wants to get the United Kingdom to compromise, it must start with anti-British intimidation. How Japan can avoid intimidating the United States while intimidating the United Kingdom seems to be a method that may not be found. On the Malaysian issue, the United States has already sent out a signal and made the commander's sword command a statement similar to an apology. Even if Japan directly targets Singapore, will it necessarily make the United States think that it has nothing to do with it? When Japan raised the Malaysian issue, it originally wanted to express collusion with Germany in addition to intimidating the United Kingdom, but Germany has not expressed anything about this, which is only a negative aspect and not the lightest touch in Japan's diplomacy.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Foreigners' View of Japan's Economic Difficulties <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>— Translated by Green</p>
<p>Recently, foreign newspapers have published many articles about Japan's economic difficulties. One of the fundamental problems is the shortage of coal and electricity.</p>
<p>The Far Eastern Survey magazine, in an article discussing Japan's economic situation, stated:</p>
<p>Lack of Coal – Many experts have long pointed out that the lack of cheap coal is one of the main obstacles to the development of Japan's heavy industry. Nevertheless, Japanese leaders have embarked on an ambitious plan for self-sufficiency in heavy industry…</p>
<p>"Since August 1937, statistics on coal mining in Japan and its territories have been declared a national secret. However, the Mitsubishi Research Bureau has determined that coal production in the first half of 1939 decreased by more than fifteen percent."</p>
<p>According to the magazine's explanation, the reasons for the decrease in coal production are insufficient skilled workers, reduced labor productivity, and a considerable shortage of expensive mining machinery.</p>
<p>The lack of coal is felt particularly acutely due to the reduction in electricity generation from hydroelectric power plants. The magazine also said:</p>
<p>Food Shortage – The problem of Japan's food supply is also very acute this year. A very interesting article was published in a recent issue of the China Weekly Review. It stated:</p>
<p>"For the first time since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, and generally speaking, for the first time in many years, the food supply of the Japanese Empire is under threat. For many months, Japan and its colonies have been feeling the food shortage. Before the new harvest, these difficulties will become even more acute. Food self-sufficiency was originally based on Japan's financial, economic, and military calculations, so the Japanese people have not directly felt the serious impact of the Sino-Japanese War on the Japanese economy. Now it is no longer self-sufficient, and Japan can no longer guarantee food self-sufficiency. The 1939-40 rural economic year was the worst year for Japan. The harvests in Japan, Korea, and Taiwan were all severely damaged due to bad weather. In addition, there are war consequences such as insufficient rural manpower, insufficient farm implements, and a lack of artificial fertilizers, all of which have worsened the farmers' situation."</p>
<p>As a result, Japan has had to restrict the consumption of many kinds of goods, import large quantities of grain, and restrict the export of many goods.</p>
<p>Normally, Japan imports rice from Korea to make up for its deficiencies, but this year Korea's harvest is also very poor. It is said:</p>
<p>"Japan's rice shortage is at least 1.2 million tons, which must be imported from abroad. Recently, Japan has ordered large quantities of rice in Bangkok, Rangoon, and Saigon, but it is very difficult to find merchant ships to transport the rice to Japan. What is most unpleasant for the Japanese is that the imported rice must be paid for in foreign currency. The shortage of rice threatens the depletion of Japan's foreign currency reserves."</p>
<p>In the past year, Japan not only had a poor rice harvest, but also poor harvests of several other important grains, such as wheat and barley. It can be seen that Japan will experience a very difficult period before the new harvest.</p>
<p>Foreign observers link Japan's recent setbacks in China with its economic situation, and the failure of military offensives. The American magazine, The Nation, in an editorial on the Sino-Japanese War and its prospects, listed the Japanese failures: the defeat in northern Guangdong, the failure to attack Changsha, and repeated unsuccessful attempts to cut the Sino-Vietnamese supply line. It said:</p>
<p>"These facts show that Japan cannot organize a serious offensive. The Japanese army, floundering on the Chinese mainland, cannot inflict serious blows on the Chinese army. The lack of coal and electricity in Japan, coupled with the lack of imported raw materials, has seriously overturned the material superiority that previously formed the basis of the Japanese army's victory."</p>
<p>According to The Nation, the Japanese have indicated that they do not intend to continue pushing forward. The Japanese attempted to attack five times, but each time they suffered a disastrous defeat.</p>
<p>The Nation concludes its analysis of the Chinese situation by saying: "The war will continue until one side or the other is completely exhausted."</p>

<p>— Eugenie</p>
<p>The current Japanese Prime Minister Mitsumasa Yonai was originally a "person without personality." He consecutively served as Minister of the Navy in the Hayashi, Konoe, and Hiranuma cabinets, and did not possess a political personality. He was merely a mediocre and unremarkable Minister of the Navy. Therefore, he often received consistent goodwill from all aspects of the political world, not because he could display transcendent political skills, but ridiculously because he always maintained an elder's style, always listening to the opinions of his then-Vice Minister Yamamoto. Yamamoto is now the Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Combined Fleet. During the era when Yonai served as Minister of the Navy, the partnership between Yonai and Yamamoto was never broken. For example, when the Hiranuma Cabinet discussed its policy toward Europe, Yonai was able to maintain a resolute attitude because Yamamoto was pulling strings behind the scenes. The substance of Yonai's political affairs as Minister of the Navy was entirely the result of Yamamoto's active manipulation. Now, letting Yonai bear this current important task alone, his future is naturally questionable. Of course, Yonai took office as prime minister from the position of admiral of the navy, and the navy naturally fully supports him. However, the future of the Yonai cabinet is still not optimistic at all. Not to mention anything else, the extent to which the army's power can be absorbed into the cabinet completely determines the direction of Yonai's politics. Frankly speaking, the appearance of the Yonai cabinet in this coup process can only be seen as a transitional cabinet in Japan's political move towards a military cabinet.</p>

<p>— Shouzhong</p>
<p>Humans cannot live independently and must gather together, divide labor and cooperate, and help each other. Therefore, human life is social life, and the organization of human life is social culture. The more advanced and tightly organized society is, the more a nation becomes. Laws are the norms of social life enforced by national power. Therefore, in addition to food, clothing, and shelter, law is a necessary condition for human survival. The more evolved humans become, the stricter the norms and the more comprehensive the laws become. The degree to which people depend on laws for survival also becomes more critical. China's political system has always been ruled by men, and the people did not know the law, only following the orders of the rulers. Since the founding of the Republic of China, the political system has undergone reforms, gradually entering the stage of the rule of law. However, due to the frequent internal strife over the years, politics has failed to be put on a regular basis, and the people's knowledge is extremely superficial. The general life is simple, and those who can understand the relationship between law and humans are very few. Under these circumstances, it is not easy for the government to exercise its power, and the people lose their protection. Cunning people take the opportunity to play with the law and infringe upon the ignorant. Even if there are extremely comprehensive laws, what difference is there from having no law?</p>
<p>Trademark and Business Reputation</p>
<p>Let us take the trademark law as an example. A trademark is a symbol of a commodity. There are many types of commodities, and there may be hundreds or thousands of commodities of the same type. Buyers have no way of distinguishing which is superior, which is inferior, which is expensive, and which is cheap. It is necessary to use a unique mark to indicate its products, so that buyers know what to choose. Merchants aim to make profits, and to achieve this goal, they must establish a reputation and promote business. In addition to improving technology, expanding the market, and expanding capital, trademarks are especially important.</p>
<p>Obtaining Trademark Exclusive Rights</p>
<p>Because there are so many types of commodities and it is difficult to distinguish them, as mentioned above, the real names of commodities are often forgotten or cannot be recognized by people. Therefore, the trademark name is used as the product name. Once a trademark is well-known, it must be prevented from being counterfeited. The only way to prevent counterfeiting is to request the government to register it in accordance with the rights granted by the trademark law. This is the acquisition of trademark exclusive rights. If anyone intends to copy it, they can sue in court and be punished.</p>
<p>Register According to Law Without Fear of Infringement</p>
<p>Due to the lack of talent and insufficient financial resources, China's industry has been progressing very slowly despite having a history of decades. Those who have already reached a considerable scale are often oppressed by foreign merchants, or rely on their strong financial resources, or rely on their special rights and interests, doing everything possible and being meticulous in every detail. They do not ignore the trivial matter of trademarks either. Their intention is nothing more than to destroy, ravage, monopolize, and control. After a domestic trademark has been approved and registered by the government, they will inevitably distort the provisions, make excuses, or even threaten and intimidate, and file lawsuits for no reason. Due to the lack of legal knowledge, domestic people often become confused and hesitant when encountering the above situations, at a loss as to what to do. As a result, they either know they are being treated unfairly but dare not argue, or they do not understand the situation and mistakenly believe that it is the most reasonable thing to do. They do not know that the loss of money is indeed limited, but the loss of reputation and business caused by having to abandon or change their own trademarks is truly small. And its impact on the entire domestic goods industry is even greater. How can those in the domestic goods industry not pay attention to it?</p>
<p>The Only Publication for Research and Reference</p>
<p>Law is a specialized science that is not easily understood by ordinary merchants. Although there are books on trademark law on the market, most of them explain the principles. Reading them is boring and tasteless, and after reading them, you cannot understand their true meaning, which does not help in practical application. It is heard that recently, Mr. Xu Guanqun, a well-known figure in the domestic goods industry in this city, and Mr. Li Huanping, who was formerly an examiner at the Trademark Bureau, have jointly compiled a book on the theory and practice of trademark law. The reporter has glimpsed its outline, revealing in detail the legislative significance and application methods of trademark law, with extensive citations and accurate interpretations. The various procedures for handling trademark registration and the handling of objections and appeals are especially the crystallization of experience. Mr. Xu, with his business, often has disputes over trademark matters, and Mr. Li has served in the Trademark Bureau for more than ten years. With the richness of experience of the two gentlemen, their writings should be insightful. People in the domestic goods industry should especially have a copy for reference.</p>
<h3 id="e112">A Phenomenon of Joy and Fear <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>— Baiyu</p>
<p>Recently, I met a friend who runs an export business. He said that the export goods of our country are increasing day by day. In the past, the main export goods were raw materials, but now, in addition to raw materials, there are also many industrial products. Not only are various parts of Southeast Asia welcoming Chinese goods for promotion, but even various states in the United States are welcoming Chinese goods. Overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia welcome Chinese goods entirely driven by patriotism, while various states in the United States welcome Chinese goods entirely because of their low prices. The devaluation of legal tender and the tightening of foreign exchange have stimulated the development of domestic goods in overseas markets. Therefore, recently, many domestic goods such as thermos bottles, seasoning powder, and grass carpets have been shipped to the United States. After listening to what my friend said, I developed a psychology of joy and fear. What is joyful? What is joyful is that the market for domestic goods is gradually expanding. What is fearful? What is fearful is that this opportunity, a good opportunity for Chinese industry and commerce to develop overseas, is such a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. If we can make good use of it, then Chinese goods can also occupy a place in the world market in the future; if we do not make good use of it and lose the trust of overseas customers, it will not be easy to open up overseas markets in the future. We know that the reason why foreigners are happy to use Chinese goods, although Chinese goods have made progress in recent years, the tightening of the exchange rate is also an important reason. Taking thermos bottles as an example, the selling price of an ordinary two-pound thermos bottle on the Chinese market is more than one yuan, which is only worth one dime in US dollars. Chinese thermos bottles are sold in the United States for two or three dimes, which is several times cheaper than American goods. Even if the shippers add tariffs and shipping costs, they still have a large profit margin. Therefore, Chinese goods are very popular with customers in overseas markets. Now that we have this good opportunity, we should take advantage of this opportunity to make various domestic goods products better and better, carefully select raw materials, improve quality, and study decoration. We should not be satisfied with being able to surpass similar products in our own country, but should aim to be on par with excellent foreign goods; we should not take low-price sales as a good strategy, but should aim to gain the trust of overseas customers with excellent quality. Take advantage of this opportunity to lay the foundation for domestic goods in overseas markets. Even if the world order is restored in the future and the exchange rate returns to normal, the credit of domestic goods overseas has been established, and there is no need to worry about the business. After listening to what this friend said, although I was filled with joy and fear, if our colleagues in the domestic goods industry can accurately grasp the goal and move forward bravely, without being satisfied with temporary short-term gains, and strive to improve the quality of domestic products, I think the joy will be greater than the fear.</p>

<p>Mr. Zhou Qintian, manager of Chongqing Minxin Department Store, came to Shanghai last week to purchase various domestic goods and is now contacting various domestic goods manufacturers to order large quantities of goods.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Wanqing, manager and engineer of Shanghai Huanqiu Iron Factory, will be going to various parts of the Southwest in the coming days to conduct inspections, and it is heard that he will build a branch factory in the Southwest.</p>
<p>The Star Five Dinner Party, organized by colleagues in the domestic goods industry in Hong Kong, will hold its 100th dinner party on the 19th of this month. In addition to expanding the event, various domestic goods factories in Shanghai will donate a large number of gifts to assist. The Hong Kong Ta Kung Pao and the Singapore Sin Chew Daily will both publish special issues to commemorate the event.</p>
<p>Mr. Gao Shiheng, the former leader of the Southeast Asian Commercial Inspection Group, has spared no effort in promoting domestic goods in various parts of Southeast Asia over the years and is highly respected by overseas Chinese businessmen in various places. Mr. Gao knows that overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia all regard using domestic goods as the supreme glory. However, if the issues of understanding and purchasing domestic goods are not resolved first, then the promotion of domestic goods in Southeast Asia will encounter unnecessary obstacles. Therefore, he specifically established Jinnan Firm in Singapore, specializing in the promotion of domestic goods. Recently, he returned to China and invited famous domestic goods manufacturers in this city to collect their products, trademarks, certificates, and the styles, advantages, and prices of various goods one by one. He compiled and printed a book called "National Goods Supply Record," which combines publicity, advertising, promotion, certification, and sales into one. It is presented in text and photos, and 50,000 copies are printed and distributed to communities, schools, chambers of commerce, and families in various parts of Southeast Asia to establish the credibility of domestic goods in Southeast Asia and expand their trade.</p>

<h3 id="e115">Report on Visiting the Zili Handicraft Cooperative <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Jingwan</p>
<p>The Zili Handicraft Cooperative was founded by Mr. Xiu Lvbin. Mr. Lin is from Minhou, Fujian. He used to be a translator in the physics and chemistry department of the Commercial Press and has a good understanding of industry. He is good at operating industry with small capital. The cooperative is not large in scale, occupying only a few rooms, with about thirty male and female workers, but the equipment is quite complete. There are quite a few steam boilers, electric motors, and major machines. The recently manufactured erasing erasers are very popular among compatriots at home and abroad. This is because the import of erasing erasers has become very scarce due to the impact of China's War of Resistance and the European War. Moreover, the goods manufactured by the cooperative can be on par with high-quality imports, and the price is even cheaper. Therefore, the islands of Southeast Asia, such as Singapore, the Philippines, and Siam, are vying to order them, thus occupying the original market of German goods.</p>
<p>After careful examination, the raw materials used by the cooperative to manufacture erasing erasers are rubber, calcium carbonate, glass powder, oil, lime, and other raw materials. After being mixed with machines, they are baked with steam in a high-pressure closed container, which is similar to the manufacturing method of other rubber products. From raw materials to finished product packaging, it must go through more than ten steps of work.</p>
<p>According to the investigation, before 1935, there were two companies that manufactured erasing erasers in China, namely Chen Jiageng Company and a certain rubber factory. Both of their products had limited sales and stopped shipping long ago. Therefore, the erasing erasers manufactured by the cooperative are still manufactured exclusively in China.</p>
<p>The erasing erasers produced by the cooperative have three brands: (1) A brand is red and the price is the cheapest, (2) Zili brand is light red and the quality is better than A brand, (3) Wanli Kuai brand is white and the quality is similar to Zili. However, because it uses German white, it looks more beautiful, and the cost is higher, so the price is also more expensive.</p>
<h3 id="e116">The Full Picture of Changyu Winery <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>— Letianzhaifu</p>
<p>Changyu's red and white wine has seen a sharp increase in sales in recent years, and it seems to be competing with foreign wines. Upscale families or social venues all consider it an elegant item, whether for entertaining guests or giving gifts. It is rare for domestic goods to have this honor. Now, I will describe a thing or two about the current situation of "Changyu" to entertain readers of this publication.</p>
<p>"Changyu" in the Past and Present</p>
<p>During the reign of Emperor Tongzhi of the Late Qing Dynasty, Mr. Zhang Bishi, the founder of Changyu, traded in the Dutch East Indies. He was a businessman full of knowledge and had a prominent position in the overseas Chinese community. At a banquet held by the French consul, he drank wine and brandy and inadvertently talked about wine. The French consul said that Yantai in your country is most suitable for planting grapes and making wine, which is better than this wine. Mr. Zhang kept these few words in mind. In the tenth year of the reign of Emperor Guangxu, he returned to China and personally went to Yantai to investigate. It was indeed confirmed what the French consul said. The following year, he spent 3 million yuan to choose a site to build a factory and wine cellar, and also purchased thousands of acres of mountainous land in the east, west, and south to plant millions of European and American famous grape seedlings. After painstaking management, it took twenty years to form a scale. Because things were newly created, there was nothing to learn from. Although there were many wineries in Europe and the United States, in the Far East, especially in China, no second winery could be found. Therefore, the winemakers had to consult Europeans and Americans. During the twenty years, three winemakers were changed, the factory was rebuilt several times, and the grapes were replanted more than ten times. Mr. Zhang once said that he had devoted half his life to the wine industry, which shows the difficulty of starting a business. In recent years, Mr. Zhang has been striving for perfection in his products and has hired Italian winemaking expert Mr. Battista Togni as a winemaker. He has produced up to six kinds of wines, which are sold at home and abroad. They are sweet and fragrant and have been highly praised by public opinion. It will be seen that domestic wine will be sold well, and the rights and interests can be gradually recovered.</p>
<p>The Quality of "Changyu" Fine Wine</p>
<p>After crushing and fermenting ripe grapes, they are put into wine barrels in the cellar and stored for five or six years. After many precise management steps, they can be felt as wine. Then, after distilling the wine, it is stored in oak barrels for more than ten years, up to several decades, before it can become high-quality brandy. Changyu's 40-year Gold Award Brandy is an example. There are more than a hundred varieties of grapes, so the wines made also have different characteristics. They are roughly divided into six types of wine: red, white, dry, sweet, sparkling, and still. Changyu's fine wine is made from pure grape juice, so it has various benefits for the human body. According to Mr. Li Shizhen, a Chinese medical expert, wine mainly warms the waist and kidneys, preserves complexion, resists hunger and cold, and replenishes blood and qi. Regular drinking can make people strong and active, and prolong life. In modern times, people in various countries in the East and West all regard wine as a magical product for replenishing blood and nourishing life. Brandy can dispel wind and cold, and also treat vomiting, cholera, dredge tendons, invigorate blood circulation, soothe the lungs, and resolve phlegm. Drinking a little after meals greatly helps digestion. It is suitable for Westerners to drink, and the sales can be wide and expensive. In recent years, Chinese people have also been following the trend and advocating it, and there is a growing trend of it being known to every household.</p>
<p>Outlook for the Future of Winemaking</p>
<p>In the past few decades, imported foreign wines have been sold everywhere in the Chinese market. It seems that in general wealthy people's banquets, foreign wines are indispensable to show extravagance. Every year, the trade deficit in the customs books is also a huge leak. Since the "July 7th" War of Resistance, the Chinese people's psychology of loving domestic goods has been more enthusiastic. In addition, due to the sharp contraction of foreign exchange, the value of a bottle of foreign wine is more than thirty or forty yuan, while "Changyu" fine wine of the same quality is only seven or eight yuan at most per bottle. Naturally, everyone's trend has changed again. Taking Shanghai as an example, the annual sales of 3,000 cases in previous years have now increased more than tenfold. Especially the overseas Chinese in the islands of Southeast Asia have been promoting it particularly hard. The markets in the southwestern provinces and cities are also gradually expanding the demand. It is expected that after the overall situation is opened up, there will inevitably be a situation where supply cannot meet demand. The raw materials produced by "Changyu" itself, fresh grapes, amount to 500,000 piculs per year. It is now planned to find ways to purchase grapes produced by the people near Yantai (estimated to be similar to the amount produced by Changyu) and mass-produce them to meet the demand. In the history of China's national industry, there has only been one "Changyu" company since the beginning (excluding handmade local wine). It has a history of fifty years and has only just established its foundation. The future development is certainly very optimistic.</p>
