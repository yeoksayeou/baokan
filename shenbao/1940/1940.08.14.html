<p>社評</p>
<h3>世界局勢綜觀</h3>
<p>遠東局勢祗是世界整個局勢中的一環嗎？還是世界整個局勢實以遠東爲起迄，實以遠東爲樞紐嗎？綜觀全局，我們深信遠東乃爲重心所繫。</p>
<p>若從目前的形態而論：全局中的最大事件，是德義進攻英國。誠如最近英國路易喬治的說法：「對不列顚的進攻，雖未眞實開始；但對不列顚帝國的鬥爭，則毫無疑義的，早已起端了一。德，義進攻的最大對象，爲佔了地球面積五分之一的不列顚帝國、而對於英倫三島的進攻，不過是其中一部份而已，。英倫三島是不列顚帝國的本部，但帝國的重心實不在三島而是建築在牠對世界海權的獨覇。因此之故，德義要想粉碎不列顚帝國，必須對於英國維持其海上覇權的海軍，予以致命的打擊。可是德義兩國的海軍，即使再加上了所得驅策的法國海軍中的一部分，其總和還非英國海軍之敵。於是德義一面以空軍的轟炸，潛艇的襲擊，來削弱英國海軍之力量；一面拉攏海上的友軍，收爲己助，而日本便是比較良好的目標。這在德義方面，必以日本海軍是否參加作戰，爲德義是否承認日本爲與國的條件；這在日本方面，累於中日戰爭，故不能亦不願以海軍加入德義陣綫而作不可必勝的孤注。至於英國，雖不以爲日本加入德義陣綫之後，便爲英國海軍所對付不了；但亦不願聽任日本加重了德義的分量。德義與英國在海上的對日追求，便是日本對德義與英國在外交上所想儘量運用的擒縱。假使世界全局很簡單的如此演進，則德義與英國不免因此而競加代價，競加所至的必然限度，便是日本所得運用外交的必然限度，而最近將來的世界全局。亦將以此飽和點爲開展的軸心。但全局不若此簡單，因爲同時還有關係複雜而遠大的遠東問題；而環繞於遠東問題四周的，尙有英美，美蘇，蘇英等三組的外交機能，對於日本對德義與英國的前途，在在可以發生深刻的影響；不但如此，法國的遠東政策，在世界全局之中，却亦有其甚爲微妙之處。由此說來，不能謂遠東局勢祇是世界全局中的一環，亦即不能謂遠東局勢有侍世界全局的決定。</p>
<p>其决，換一觀點，請從遠東方面檢討全局：遠東的最大事件，當然是中日戰爭。這在日本，自始希望速戰速決，亦即希望由軍事完成一切；三年來如此，而現在所謂全力解決事變，意義亦復如此，且更迫切。所不同者，三年前氣吞河嶽，獨行其是；現在則着眼於第三國，想完全斷絕中國的海外通路；對於香港，澳門，廣州灣，越南，緬甸，逐步進迫，而收穫了不同程度的暫時成功。這類成功，並非他的本身具有何種成功的因素，却因英法本身發生了缺陷；蘇聯的本身無缺陷，故中蘇間陸上大道，必始終暢通，而日本對蘇聯亦必會不作無效的嘗試。即就日本所暫時成功的部分而論，當然予中國以暫時的不便，但並不能如其理想的收效，蓋中國在事實行動上不因此暫時的不便而停止抗戰。何况跟着日本所暫時成功而發的：一使遠東有利害關係的任何國家，更明瞭日本拓展欲望的無饜；二使法國重新考慮其妥協政策，而抉擇於斷送與抵抗的最後關頭；三使德國考慮是否徒予日本不勞而獲，坐收漁利；四使英國由切膚之痛而毅然作萬一的準備；然使美國感覺火燄確已這近了菲列賓的門戶，加速其堅定政策的推進；亦使中國獲有良好的機會，取得有利的新戰塲，以分散日本兵力而發揮消耗戰略。故日本暫時成功的决一階段，決非繼續成功而增進戰果；相反的，使遠東問題更複雜而加重了日本的艱難。歐戰的本質是德義對大不列顚；而遠東則演進至淤多數國家對日本。</p>

<p>涵江口北　海道巢穴</p>
<p>是日下午五時許抵涵江口北約二十里之小港拋錨、船上乘客均屬與泉土著、故對於附近土情甚詳、見神華輪拋錨、衆乘客旋要求船主、啟椗開往他處、同時說明該處海盜盤踞、停泊異常危險、船主（英人）不允、移時卽見港內有木質汽艇五艘駛出、乘客臨時恐慌、幸五汽艇當卽他去、始告安定、神華輪遂在該處拋宿一宵、翌晨（七日）見新安納·永豐·兩輪駛來繼續北行、船主瞥見後、卽亦起錨、隨二輪北駛、</p>
<p>無法入口　致遭不測</p>
<p>惟沿途均有日艦駐泊、無法駛入附近口岸、於下午、神華輸仍駛回昨拋泊之小港口外洋面、乘容均表不滿、但船主堅持不變、至八日晨、港內又駛出木壳汽艇一艘、懸掛某國旗幟、儎土兵五十餘人、全副武裝、乘客於瞥見汽艇駛出時、曾要求船主起錨避開、船主依然不允、不料該汽艇直駛而來、船主始覺悟遭遇不測、但已不及、各盜絡續躍上甲板、將領港台·無錢電間監視、並命船員乘客不得行動、卽驅至艙內、開始刦掠、</p>
<p>盜艇密集　逐日卸貨</p>
<p>將船員乘客行李悉數裝上汽艇、復將船員乘客驅上甲板、搜刦各人隨身所帶現金飾物、被刦一空、事畢、又迫船主駛入港內、該處四面島嶼、中有一港、入港後拋泊、盜艇卽鳴汽笛、旋有四五駁子駛來、盜卽啟艙、將艙內貨物卸上　子、並命船上員工、帮同起卸、員工不敢拒絕、傍娩盜匪誤認無綫電員及二車爲買辦、同時有數猶太乘客、均被據去、無綫電員及二車經盜詢問、知不是買辦、於决晨釋放回船、盜等復追問買辦所在，幸當時隱匿甚密、未遭據去、後因盜駁已裝滿、乃又命駛出港口、繼續卸貨、</p>
<p>日艦駛近　從容逸去</p>
<p>至十日晨、有日艦　雲號、在附近拋泊、卽派汽艇一　駛來、盜等見之、卽下船而去但並無驚惶態度、日艦汽艇靠船後、日軍官兵士登輪、對被刦情形略詢一過、卽將留落盜匪五六人帶去、並命神華輪開行、乃卽啟錨、船主初擬駛回上海、乘客因遭此洗刦後、已分文全無、至上海無以維持、遂要求船主、駛至附近海口、俾得登陸、故卽向涵江口南駛、又因各口均右日艦、無法停錨、故於土日晨決駛回來滬、</p>
<p>狼狽回滬　被刦一空</p>
<p>於前日（十二日）晚八時抵滬、停靠浦東隆茂棧碼頭、該輪此次被騎刦三日、貨物已被刦四分之三、乘客船員行李物件、隨身現鈔飾物、盡數刦去、並擄去猶太乘客數名、下落不明、估計損失的在百餘萬元、該輪船主大副買辦等、昨已擬就報吿書報吿本行、該行根據船主報告、日內當轉呈英領署、至乘客抵滬後、因身無分文、無法上岸、故一部有親友者登睦探望一部仍逗留船內、以待善後、</p>

<p>日軍當局　通知開會</p>

<p>英美方面　商得諒解</p>
<p>會議時、凡提出准許美軍巡邏英軍防區之動議者、日方將斷然反對、英方正式宣佈駐滬英軍撤退前、英美防軍司令私人會談時、必已商得某種諒解、然日方封英美當局間之片面的協定、將切實加以反對、預料星期四日之會議、難以商得適當解決辦法、</p>
<p>撤退確期　尚無所知</p>
<p>英駐滬防軍離滬撤退之期、據向英方面探詢、現仍嚴守緘默、惟悉駐滬英軍昨日宣佈、定於十六日星期五下午八時三十分至九時、假XCEN電台廣播音樂、此爲英軍在本市廣播之創舉、亦爲駐滬已歷兩年餘之該英國軍隊之臨別紀念、故英防軍之開始撤退、當在本月十六日以後、</p>

<h3>華商麺粉廠　存貨用罄　有卽將停車說　內地粉紛運滬</h3>
<p>本市租界內各華商麵粉廠、因原料存貨用罄、洋麥定貨未到、國麥被阻絕跡、乃不得已於昨日議決、卽在週內全部停車、其剩餘麵粉爲數本微、亦議在日內售罄後停止批售、記者以麵粉爲北方人與平民麵食者所必需、關於本市民食問題、極爲重要、爰將調查所得、報道於下、</p>
<p>新麥統制　忍痛維持</p>

<p>訂購洋麥　尚未運到</p>
<p>繼則一方加費吸收本麥定訂洋麥、奈本麥加增費用後、仍難接續運到、而洋麥因無船隻及外匯與經濟關係、祇定到美澳麥各一船、且定麥受國際風雲影饗、迄今未能如期到申應用、據稱粉業往年之遭受困難者、祗有成本高於售價與銷路呆滯而致虧折而巳、‘今則雖欲忍痛維持開車而亦不能、</p>
<p>民食前途　尚無影響</p>
<p>且北方銷區、已盡被外粉所佔、申粉再難揷足、南洋一帶常被封鎖、本市及內地亦遭外粉與內地廠粉所傾佔、故粉業前途、已頻絕境、不祇因目前原料中斷被逼停車而已也、所幸本市民食有關之麵粉供給、刻下尙不致發生問題、無錫之廣豐九豐·常州恒豐·長江一帶之揚州貽成·揚子·泰來等廠麵粉已絡繹到滬應市、洋粉則有維大洋行之砲臺牌新粉亦經運到、民食前途、似不因滬廠停車而虞缺乏、</p>

<p>由這一個分析，可以得到二個概念；一是總指數的上升，受食物的影響最深，而七月份再加上房租增捐的因素；二是衣着燃料兩類指數的下降遠不敵食物類指數的上升，故它所影響於總指數的甚淺。由於這兩個概念，使上海市民對於租界當局平衡物價的工作，發生它究盡了幾多力量的疑問。</p>
<p>租界當局鑒於上海物價問題的嚴重，遲遲於今年二月，法相界當局方有評價委員會的組織，同月十九日公布章程十六條。公共租界工部局亦開始硏究對策。直倒四月十二日十三日法國領事署及公共租界工部局爲切實平準物價起見，先後頒發佈吿，對於商店出售指定的食物（包括米，麵粉，油，鹽，茶，糖，牛乳，肉類，蛋類，魚類，菜蔬，水果），燃料（包括煤，炭，火油），及肥皂，須標明每單位的零售價格，平準的工作似乎有進一步的措施。不過兩租界當局對於所定零售食物燃料肥皂等品，除僅能按期公布平均價格表外，對於躉售物價方面的投機操縱之風，並沒有切實的辦法，相反地祗做了一些空洞的工作，如五月三日布吿禁止利用滙率變動的機會，抬高物價，公共租界當局更於同月十八日分函有關各商業團體，促令低售價。對於物價絲毫未收平準的功效，而當局所盡最大的唯一的力量以從事平準的食物類，非但不如衣着類燃料類的稍稍下降，反見長期的上升，自一月的三三七·九七以至七月的四八五·八〇。上海的市民決不故意責難租界當局的平準工作，但是它所從事的工作結果，對它的工作顯明的採取攻勢（如食物類指數上升），則感受生活重壓的上海市民，大有骨骨鯁在喉之感了</p>
<p>或者說，上海四週全爲淪陷區，極易購辦的貨物，及極廉價的貨物，因種種阻碍，種種苛捐，以至艱於購得，價格不得不漲固是實際的困難。但是平準工作，木在疏通貨運，取締囤積，防止投機，跋禁操縱。如不能解除這方面的困厄，顯見平準工作不能盡力。</p>
<p>總之，上海物價問題這樣一天嚴重一天，決非上海前途之福。我們也深知租界當局處理的困難，但這是共同利害關係，明知說也徒然，好在以市民福利爲前提的租界當局，必有以紓倒懸之急。（完）</p>

<h3>肥皂</h3>
<p>— 柳塘</p>
<p>長日無聊，閒居靜坐，偶與兒女　談往事前言以消遣。秉中逐以肥皂之皂字作何解相詢。余日：皂本作皂，皂其俗體也。皂訓色黑。古稱吏役之賤者曰皂曰隸，後世稱官卒曰皂隸本此；官員升堂，則持杖站班，出行則么喝開道。戴尖頂高聳之帽，穿皂褐直襟之衣，細察皂字，宛然一皂隸戴帽直立，持杖之狀也。相傳皂隸之帽，象徵元皇室所戴之冠，明太祖滅元，乃用爲隸役之帽，故此一帽，固饒有民族歷史意義也。秉中又詢余，皂旣爲褐黑色之義，何以肥皂之色不黑而黃。余曰，昔日之皂黑，今日之皂黃。蓋肥皂二字，尙爲中國原有之詞，，而今日所用之肥皂，已非中國原有之肥皂，而爲外國傳入之肥皂也。中國舊時所用以供洗濯之用者，（一）皂莢，（二）鹼，（三）灰濾水。皂莢爲樹名，高可數丈，夏月開黃綠色之花，花後結莢，扁平如豆（白扁豆）莢而大，長可七八寸，遠望之，纍纍若刀在鞘中，其色黑，故曰皂莢，亦稱皂角。煎其莢於水中，可以浣衣。擇其莢實長而肥厚，脂多而黏者，搗之爛，範之成方形，卽曰肥皂，摻以香料，則曰香皂；肥皂之名，蓋由於此也。在昔蘇滬一帶，造此皂者甚夥，其色黑，其香澤有桂花等不一，余幼時，嘗見先君子喜用之，當時雖有茂生等香皂，而仍習用土製之桂花皂。惟質粗，刺膚作痛，故洋皂進口，土皂漸失其用也。（現在畫錦里胥粉店尙有由莢肥皂可售）</p>
<p>鹼，大都由北方運來。齡有兩種，一係透明，一係不透明。產於包頭等處，所謂斥鹵之地也。舊時由天津，轉營口，再由沙船駁運南下。貧霎之家，用草木灰置竹籮中，墊以稱草，盛灰於內，日以水澆濾之，下　　，水中含有鹼質，卽炭酸鈣　，　供洗濯</p>
<p>外國肥皂何時始入中國，此則　從　　。　　　謂紅　　　書，最可以看出康雍間一班貴族生活然肥皂之見於紅樓夢者，僅有第二十一回湘雲洗臉之後，寳玉趁勢也在這殘水中洗臉之際，紫鵑遞過香皂去，寳玉道：「這盆裏就不少，不用搓了。」固不知此處所用之香皂，爲洋貨，抑爲土產？但照時代論之，還以土貨之成分爲多。一則紅樓夢作者對於外來之物，常提示出來。再則洋貨進口，自乾嘉道光之後而始盛。三則從「搓」字看去，當爲舊時之肥皂無疑；蓋以皂莢製成之香皂，其質粗而堅，不若近代香皂，柔滑而光潤，故揩洗時用用力去「搓」不可。此外婦女所以潤澤皮膚者；一爲胰，取自猪臟，用酒浸之，可以袪龜裂而使皮膚滑潤。一爲蜂蜜之蜜，用以塗抹。及洋蜜進來，此一者亦自然淘汰矣。洋蜜卽甘油也，甘油爲肥皂之副產，固爲同氣連枝也。</p>
<p>余既一時求肥皂何時始入中國而不可得，因思訪之於朱志堯先生。以志堯先生年已七十八，且生長於上海，早年卽投身於實業界，而其矍鑠精神，不减伏波當年也。志堯先生談，伊十餘歲時，洗衣猶用舊法，未有目前所用之肥皂；惟外國香皂已有之，猶未見盛行。據其回憶，似爲當時德商某洋行經理某語其華經理曰：思偕君作海外遊，曷考察孰爲最合銷於、中國之貨物。及華經理返，語洋經理曰，有二者價最廉，而用最廣，一卽洗衣之肥皂，一卽縫衣之引綫。洋經理如其言，固獲盛銷云。惟肥皂在當時，中國人亦有仿製者，然以設備簡陋，規模狹小，故出品甚劣，色黃而水分多，鮮時其實甚潮軟，不堪洗擦，俗稱爲「黃南瓜肥皂」；宿後堅硬異常，鹼　甚重，易傷衣；但以缺乏良皂，仍樂用之。自祥茂固本二皂先後行世，（此外尙有北忌等皂質地純良，用者稱便。固本廠本爲德商辦，於第一次歐戰返國，乃由五洲出資　營，至今屹爲中國製皂業之巨電。</p>
<p>昨爲八一三，各業多停市，因寫此以實商業金融。余本有經濟叢談之作，就民生經濟，日用百物，加以整理，求其源委，俟有機會，再當　讀者相見也。</p>

<h3>元武湖風景</h3>
<p>金陵太平門外，有元武湖焉，周圍三十里，皆植芰荷，三面不通人境，有五洲漁戶世其業，另設官以經理漁稅，所產蓮子，亦歸其採售，利至溥也。粵匪亂定，曾文正公總督兩江時，適有江北飢民來寗，遂仿以工代賑之舉，令其築成一堤，中造數橋以通水，堤長數里，堅固無似，論者謂可與西湖之蘇白二堤，後先輝映矣。堤盡爲湖神廟，則本舊有而重新之者，廟旁築樓三楹，中懸曾文正公小像，太倉薛慰農先生撰一楹帖云：「人間宰相，天上神仙，果然蓬島歸眞，想員嶠方壺有如此水。小隊曾來，大名不朽，留得湖山遺愛，比謝安王導別擅千秋。」登樓遠望，惟見綠雲萬頃，環繞無際，而千山聳翠，極目不窮，尤足憑眺，想花時遊屐，當更有應接不暇者，爲誦袁簡齋先生，想花心比見花深之句，不禁連流久之。廟門側有井一，名曰銅鈎，據住持僧道言：掘井深二丈餘，得一銅鈎而泉出，味淸冽，可匹雨花台之永寗泉，試之不謬。惜銅鈎呈縣署，不獲見爲憾！</p>

<h3>保健問題的探討</h3>
<p>— 曹健</p>
<p>誰都知道，都市爲着人口衆多，空氣不潔的緣故，所以也就是各種疾病最猖獗最流行的地方。自從戰後從各地來上海的人日多，各人爲着經濟的關係，一間小小的房子住上幾家人，似乎不算甚麼一回事。假如不幸的話，家中有一位生了病，那就更糟糕了。有時候生的是傳染病，那就只好一個一個的傳染了。貧寒的人生了病，想去請醫生，這是談何容易的事，飯都吃不飽，怎樣冉有錢去看醫生呢？所以許許多多貧窮的人生了病，不是因爲庸醫醫治不當而死，就是聽天由命，祈待死神之降臨，這是多麼悲慘的事！我要再這裏來述一述社會保健之工作，無非是爲着大衆的健康問題，及祈望减少貧苦人死於非命，希望有心人士能注意焉。</p>
<p>我以爲社會保健的問題，不是簡單的一回事也不是個人的事，而是大衆的事。社會的保健工作是多方面的，需要每個人熱誠的合作，也需要有捨己爲羣的人出來倡導實行，也需要許多人廣爲宣傳，使大家明瞭保健工作的眞義。各人多盡一份的力量，也就得到多一些的收穫。以下的幾點，是我個人所想到的社會保健工作，不過仍需專家及其他人士來補充研究探討。</p>
<h3>公共衛生的遵守</h3>
<p>城市中人口衆多，假如大家再不注重公共衛生的話，那疾病就更猖獗了。現在仍有許多人，他們不明瞭公共衛生之眞義，仍舊隨地吐痰，隨地便溺。我們大家須知道，吐痰一在地似乎沒有多大關係，但假如痰中有細菌存在的話，就很容易傳染給別人。爲着自己及別人的健康着想，我們都應痛改不良的習慣。</p>
<h3>創設保健會</h3>
<p>創設保健會的主要目的，就是使一般人民在疾病未重時，就得到診治的機會。有許多入在毛病初起時就忽視它，結果到病入膏肓的時候才去找醫生，你看怎樣能醫治好呢？我們現在的社會，需要一些名醫出來，創設保健會，使大家有獲醫治疾病的機會。美國的落杉機有魯羅醫診團，是一個著名的保健會，營務發達，參加魯羅醫診團的人，每年只須納費若干，就可得名醫來診治疾病，並可常行身體康健檢查，明瞭身體之近况。假如各人都能在毛病未重時，就去醫治，那末醫生也毫不費力治好他的毛病，而病人本身也可免除受重病的痛苦。</p>
<h3>醫生須具濟世之心</h3>
<p>有許多貧苦的人，罹着疾病，想去看醫生，但多爲港診費太貴的緣故而看不起。所以我希望醫生們須具濟世之心，撥一些的時間爲貧苦大衆療疾，或免費治療，或只收藥費。</p>
<h3>廣作衛生的宣傳工作</h3>
<p>衛生的宣傳工作，有着許多事可做，如出定期的衛生刊物，播送普通衛生智識，調查貧苦大衆健康狀况，舉行健康衛生宣傳週等等。</p>
<p>以上述的幾點，是我個人所感覺極需要的社會保健工作，但我知道社會保健的工作，當然沒有這樣簡單。我極希望能引起專家們來討論，發表意見。</p>
<h3>廢物利用</h3>
<p>— 淸暉</p>
<p>在徵求欄內，有某大公司徵求啞子司閣二名。我度其用意，不外下列三點：一，可嚴守秘密；二，可任意痛駡，絕不抗議：三，環境險惡，自由言論，恐招及身之禍。除此以外，尙有兩種廢人亦可利用：一爲跛司賬，因跛者不易東跑西走，可死守財庫。二爲盲侍役，因彼不能認識主人友朋的眞面目。但是，在道失業恐慌中，恐有被迫而裝啞，扮盲，詐跛之徒，徵求者不可不愼也。</p>
<h3>救救貧苦的失學兒童　－暑期鄰童義務校教師來函－</h3>
<p>— 余壁</p>
<p>編輯先生：</p>
<p>我們是一羣年靑的中學生，爲了服務社會，救濟一般失學兒童，在暑期內我們開辦了一所義務學校。學費是免收的，書籍亦由我們供給。</p>
<p>在短短的將近一月半的敎導中，我們發現在許多貧苦的兒童中，有許多是有智慧的，而且成績也不錯。於是問題就這樣發生了，如果我們的議務學校結束以後，這些有智慧而萬貫優良的貧苦學生，不是又要失學了嗎？這使我們覺得很不忍心，但我們又沒有力量去供給他們的求學經費。所以我希望編輯先生能將這信登載出來，使社會人士及慈善團體給我們一戰幫助，好讓這些苦兒童繼續求學，這是我們萬分感激。祝你</p>
<p>安好！　上海靑年會中學鄰童義校敎師上</p>
<p>如果有慈善人士或機關能幫助我們的，請逕函四川路五九九號，當派人前來接洽。華聯同樂會，對於會員福利事業，向來推行不遺餘力。最近幷增設高尙理髮所一處，每元四次，修面則九角六次；由該會消費合作社印劵發售。每理髮或修面一次，付券一張，此外並無需索。據試過者云：「生活」也做得不錯，故日來前往該所剃「經濟頭」者頗衆。</p>
<p>霍桑探案</p>
<h3>舞后的歸宿</h3>
<p>— 程小青著</p>
<p>第五章　惡消息</p>
<p>那老頭兒兇狠狠地瞧着他問道：「幹什麽？」</p>
<p>那少年道：「我要找那姓趙的。』</p>
<p>「沒有，搗鬼！」</p>
<p>「他昨天還在這裏。」</p>
<p>「老子是今天來的。你做夢！」</p>
<p>那「做夢」的聲浪還沒有消逝，砰的一聲，門又重新關上了。余甘棠好像很着惱。他的右邊的衣裳，突然挺起了一角，顯然是槍管。這傢伙委實太鹵莽了，自己敲錯了人家的房間，難道還想開槍？這時幸虧有一個穿白長衫的侍役，從東端走過來，看見余甘棠再要舉手敲門，忙奔過去阻止。「先生，找誰？」「姓趙的——唔，姓錢的。」「你弄錯了。這裏面是姓金。」「他昨天還在這裏。」「是的，錢先生在昨夜裏搬走的。你不能這樣亂敲人家的房門。</p>
<p>這茶房的號數我瞧不淸楚，不過不是剛才的七十一號。他的伶俐的口齒竟使余甘棠發作不出。</p>
<p>他向那茶房釘了一眼，問道：「他搬到那裏去了？」</p>
<p>那老練的茶房也勇敢地回了他一眼，冷冰冰地回答：「誰知道？」他就自顧自地重新回東端去了。</p>
<p>我這時祗顧到前面的緊張局勢，却忘記了自身的掩護。有一個穿西裝的中年男子，正從我的背後走過來。我把眼角一側，以爲是霍桑來了。不是。那人也穿着一身深色的衣服，一頂黑色呢帽壓得很低，帽簷下的目光分明注射着我。我不禁有些兒發窘。其實我這種姿態，的確容易引起人家的疑視。我索性僂下身子，把皮鞋帶的結抽出，慢慢地重新縛結。這一種姿態竟度過了兩重難關。那中年男子和余甘棠二人就在我的面前迎面擦身而過。除了那中年男子再回過頭來向我瞧了一瞧，余甘棠却目不斜視地直奔西口。我重新立直身子的時候，余甘棠的背形已不見了。（七五）</p>
<h3>基督的自動犧牲（二）</h3>
<p>上次我們提起基督的自動犧牲是敎訓我們甚麽是愛，甚麽是眞友誼，還有呢？（三）要敎訓我們甚麽是權牲：平常人喊得震天價壞的犧牲，大都不是犧牲。有些慣於訛詐人的，以爲少詐取別人一點錢財，便是犧牲。還有一種野心家，不過將他的欲望程度，稍爲减低了一點，便以爲是犧牲了。實在嚴格地請起來，無論是犧牲光陰，氣力，金錢，以及其他一切，祇要存着一些希冀心，便不是犧牲了。商店的大滅價，不能算爲犧牲，祇有自送，視是犧牲。耶穌的（相牲是毫無代價的，他爲要世人得救，甘心捨命。（四）要敎訓我們教法如何完成：耶穌說：『誰願爲首，就必作你們的僕人。正如人予來不是要受人的服事，乃是要服事人，並且要捨命，作多人的購價」（馬太二十27）所一謂「作多人贖價」的意思，就是一個人代替衆人死。這種精神，不論是信徒或非信徒，都是欽佩不置的。耶穌被釘十字架，凡是信服他步他後鏖的人都得救了。而且這種救恩的範圍，並沒有時間空間與種族的限制，古今萬國人類的罪惡得着赦免，完全靠着耶穌的死。</p>
<p>從前有一個窮寡婦，以其傭役的所得，含辛茹苦，撫養他的遺孤，直到大學畢業。在他兒子大學畢業的那天，他去參觀畢業禮，滿心盼望他兒子能給與他一種快慰，誰知他的兒子，因爲已經有一位富翁的女兒做他的未婚妻，不願意這位小姐知道他還有這樣一位爲人幫傭的娘，於是他竟埋沒天良，指着他的生母對人說：「這是我家多年的女傭，我在小的時候曾經咂過她幾口奶罷了，並沒有多大關係」。這位大學生因爲怕失綽床婚妻，竟忍心不認他的生母，眞是忘恩負義，可恥孰甚！耶穌是我們捨命的朋友，我們豈可不承認他是救主，而祗以爲這不過是歷史上的一幕悲劇呢？讀者欲知詳細，請函訽上海愛文義路三五一號文字布道社，當有詳細答覆。</p>

<p>㳺藝界</p>
<h3>桂林娛樂事業一暼</h3>
<p>— 小齊</p>
<p>桂林是現在國內六大都市之一，而且潮氣蓬勃，無論一種事業，都以活潑的姿態在不斷的長進中；娛樂方面，自然也不能列外。</p>
<p>桂林現有九家戲院，平劇，粵劇，話劇，桂林劇，應有盡有，色色俱備。桂林劇，是流行於桂林中下級社會層的一種地方戲，界於平劇與湘戲之間。三者雖屬同源，但因長期間單獨發展，已有牠不可磨滅的地方性，而帶着牠獨特的一種色彩。牠的腔調，似乎不如平劇的婉轉變化，有時也不如平劇之高吭爽脆，可是牠那種樸素的作風，却特別配合當地土著的脾胃。尤其是字句比較聽得懂，眞個是明白如話，老嫗都解。牠的表演較慢，有時且不如平劇的明快；但做工很細膩熨貼，極爲動人。</p>
<p>「廣西戲劇改進會」，是由黨、政、軍、敎育、藝術各界熱心文化運動，志趣相同的幾十個人所組織，由已故廣西大學校長馬君武博士任會長，白鵬飛氏任副會長。他們開始改良桂劇，後來戲家歐陽予倩來桂，組織一個健全的劇團，在去年夏天，開始排演有名的「梁紅玉一一劇，以後又陸續排演了「桃花扇」，「木蘭從軍」，「搜廟反正」，「勝利年」等好幾　名作，成績都很不錯。至於表演技術及舞蹈佈景，燈光，服裝，均極進步，如「人面桃花」表情戲，獲得相當的稱譽·所以桂劇的革新進步，皆由馬君武博士的提倡改革以及歐陽予倩先生指導之功。此外應時而起的時代化娛樂則有游泳塲。桂林東郊漓江紫洲方面，現在利用江水開闢爲游泳塲。江水澄淸，江底水草同石子，都歷歷可數。比之香港外海水灣塲和上海的高橋游泳塲，雖大小各殊，設備也較爲簡陋，可是碧水如油，兩岸重巒疊嶂，倒映水中，蒼翠可掬，風景却遠勝於港滬。所以一般摩登男女，往往連袂來此，大過其游泳癮；或則一葉扁舟，放乎中流，聽其所之，引吭高歌，大有樂而忘返之勢。</p>
<h3>陳雲裳的家庭生活</h3>
<p>— 嚴次平</p>
<p>有精緻的書室尋精神食糧　有寬敞的平台享天倫之樂巨籟達路上有一座新式建築的洋房子，常常有一輛漂亮的汽車，開出開進，常常可以看見一個活潑嬌美的姑娘，用輕快的，幾乎是舞蹈式的步子，踏上或是走出那輛車子，她是大衆影迷們關心着的姑娘—銀擅紅星陳雲裳小姐。</p>
<p>這三層樓共有三大間，很舒齊地派了三間用塲，一間作臥室，一間作書室，一間是休憇室及會客室佈置，精緻雅潔她書室裏有好許多書架書櫉，堆滿了文藝書籍，電影刋物，以及別的許許多多能够增進智識的書本子，姑娘常常用柔膩的手指，愛惜地撫摸着它們，像一個慈愛的母親撫摸着自己的孩子一般。</p>
<p>每天她要在那兒坐上幾個鐘點，看每天報紙，閱諛電影刋物，更關心着那上面寫着關於她自己的批評，她都小心地把關於她的文字和照片，一一剪下來，貼在一本簿子上，成了一本很有趣味，很有價値的剪貼簿，她更硏究關於電影表情或是藝術的書籍，雖然他的表情已經是第一流的了，她的藝術，已經是走上成功的路上了，但是她却還不滿足，還是孜孜地追求着一切知識。</p>
<p>她不單費時間在看書，她還得彈琴唱歌，每天下午二時，她要去讀英文，除了很忙，抽不出空來，從不間斷的。陳雲裳是個廣東姑娘，但是却會說口流利的淸脆的國語，當她未來上海之前，她的國語還不十分純熱，但是學了幾個月以後，進步的飛速，竟使她的國語敎師何劍飛歎服。她是一個純粹的二十世紀的摩登姑娘，私生活方面，她不會同流合汚，和普通一般女明星們地浪漫。她是一個孝女，一個好姊姊，這决香港風雲緊張，陳雲裳不放心她的爸爸和妹妹住在那兒，就叫他們到上海來憑空多添了二個人，一層房子，便不够住了，雲裳不忍她家裏人不舒服地擠在一起，便另外將公庽的四層樓轉頂下來，供給他們居住，道四層樓更比三層樓寬敞，也是有二一大間，而且還有一個很大的平台，凉爽的夏風，常常從平台上吹過來，上面張着帆布搭的篷，精緻得很，有着夜花園的風味，每天晚上雲裳有空，就和家人坐在那個平臺上，享受天倫之樂。</p>

<p>鬚生李盛藻，應黃金大戲院之約，昨搭順天輪由津來滬，於上午上時抵埠。同來者除配角童芷苓，高盛麟，江世玉，孫盛武，李世霖等人外，李之泰山高慶奎亦相偕同來。按高慶奎爲十年前之紅伶，名聞大江南北，六年前嘗與坤伶章過雲合作出演黃金，期滿北返後，因戒烟而病嗓，竟然一字不出，因而不能重獻其大好身手，觀衆無不惜之。此次黃金堅邀高伶來滬，爲乃婿排演「贈綈袍」「哭秦庭」等高派傑作，乃毅然南下，記者昨晤高伶於滄洲飯店旅决，其人非但已較前蒼老，且已成一啞嗓兒，令人有不勝今昔之感。據高伶語記者，乃婿盛藻，邇來嗓音奇佳，大有慶奎全盛時代之概。慶奎早年成名傑作，已悉數授於盛藻，是故盛藻已成慶奎傳人，高伶言時在無限感慨中，顯見欣悅之色，料想乃婿之藝，必不同凡響也。此外尙有一記價値者，卽此次與盛藻偕來之坤伶童芷苓，色藝雙絕，向爲後起坤旦中不可多得之才，預料芷苓此次出演，必能紅遍春申，不讓吳素秋專美於前也。</p>

<p>華雷斯皮來盡瘁電影事業至今已有三十年之久，以資格論，在目前好來塢的全部明星當中，能和他相頡頏的只有一個李昂巴里摩亞。不過他的號召力並非絕對因爲「老」的關係，而且正因共老，我們可以得到一個結論：如果不是具有優越的演技，——有充分吸引觀衆的力量，則在此良長三十年的競爭過程中早就被淘汰了。這位大藝人生在干薩斯城是警察諾皮來三個兒子中最小的一個；自小好勤，無心向學，喜與鐵道工人為友。在未進人影壇之前，曾經當過螺釘廠的工人和馬戲班的馴獅人。</p>
<p>在一九一年的六月，華雷斯開始獻身銀幕。起初他專演喜劇，然而當時正是開斯東（Keystone）的全盛時代他却一籌莫展。於是在主演了Behind　The　Door　一片，獲得成功之後，改而扮演俠士型而帶有幽默性的角色；先後中演過四騎士，三劍客，羅賓漢和獅心李却等好幾部默片。之後，因環境關係曾再度改演喜劇。</p>

<h3>One Hundred Japanese Warships Gather in Waters Near Vietnam; Long Yun Resolves to Uphold Central Government's Intent in Addressing the Vietnam Situation; Japanese Side Claims Negotiations Between France and Japan to Conclude Within Days</h3>
<p>New York: This station received a wireless message from Australia yesterday, citing a Soviet radio station report: one hundred Japanese warships are currently assembling near the coast of French Indochina. (United Press, 13th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Yunnan Province Chairman Long Yun reportedly told a certain foreign traveler visiting Chongqing from Kunming that Yunnan Province and himself would adhere to any decision made by the Central Government to address the situation in Vietnam without question. According to a senior Yunnan Province official who recently traveled to Vietnam, this official told the traveler that he believes the Vietnamese authorities will resist any Japanese attack unless Vichy imposes strong pressure. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>Hanoi: According to Japanese sources, it is widely expected that negotiations between Japan and France regarding Vietnam will conclude within days. Subsequently, a Japanese inspection group and Vietnamese authorities will hold a roundtable conference here to establish a detailed agreement. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>Moscow: The Soviet newspaper Pravda commented on the international situation today, stating, "Since France's defeat, Britain, with American aid, continues to wage war against Germany and Italy. The war has now entered a new phase. The current situation is extremely complex due to the absence of land battlefields. On the continent, Britain has no base to wage war against Germany. As for the work of the German command, it is also extremely complex. Unless the war has moved to Britain, Germany fears it will be unable to cause the collapse of the British army and inflict fatal blows on its key centers. In short, if the Anglo-German war is limited to the sea and air, the war will inevitably be prolonged. American imperialism is eager to see the war prolonged so that the United States can, according to a new interpretation of the Monroe Doctrine (i.e., the Americas for the Americans), safeguard American influence in the Americas. At the same time, the strengthening of British resistance will facilitate the United States in resolving problems in the Pacific. One of the tasks of the United States in the Pacific is to prevent Japan from taking advantage of the European situation to enhance its position in the Pacific. The Dutch East Indies and Vietnam have attracted Japan's attention. Japan intends to strengthen its position in the Dutch East Indies, but to avoid further straining US-Japan relations, Japan has placed its main pressure on Vietnam. The Japanese side believes that since France has been defeated, it will not have strong resistance. Japan intends to use Vietnam as a base for operations against China and to control the Vietnamese market. According to foreign newspapers, Germany and Italy do not object to preventing Japan's expansion, so the Governor-General of Vietnam has adopted a firm attitude." (TASS, 13th)</p>
<p>Guilin: Sao Dang Bao newspaper yesterday advocated that the Chongqing government should conclude a military mutual assistance alliance with the Vichy government to defend Vietnam. The newspaper pointed out that the Chinese army is the only armed reinforcement closest to Vietnam in the event of an attack on Vietnam. Therefore, Vietnam should know that approaching the Chinese National Government and concluding this agreement is essential. The newspaper continued, "The Japanese inspection commission in Vietnam is actually nothing more than a disguised espionage organization. In other words, the commission is the Fifth Column in Vietnam and also the vanguard of the Japanese army to conquer Vietnam. Japan is planning to replay the Manchurian Incident in Vietnam, so the situation in Vietnam is becoming increasingly critical, which is an undeniable fact. Whether the Vichy government is still considering whether to acknowledge Japan's repeated demands, or quickly join hands with the Chinese army, we are really baffled." (United Press, 13th)</p>
<p>Singapore: According to a Bangkok correspondent for the Straits Times, Thai parliamentarians have recently demanded that the government demand the return of a portion of land within French Indochina that previously belonged to Thailand. People in the northern provinces of Thailand, in a petition submitted to parliamentarians, insisted that it is most appropriate to make demands to France at this time. This information was first disclosed by Thai newspapers. (United Press, 13th)</p>

<h3>Overseas Chinese Chen Rongguang; Enthusiastically Donates Funds</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Chen Rongguang, an overseas Chinese from Tavoy, Burma, has always been keen on overseas Chinese affairs and social work. After the outbreak of the War of Resistance, Mr. Chen's patriotism was deeply felt, and he always wanted to make a contribution. However, due to his family not being wealthy, he was unable to do so. Recently, he received seven hundred kyats in matured insurance money from a life insurance company, equivalent to three thousand yuan in national currency, and donated the entire amount to the motherland to fund the care of refugee children. The funds have been remitted to Madame Chiang Kai-shek, who in turn forwarded them to the Children's Welfare Association. Madame Chiang Kai-shek appreciated his patriotic enthusiasm and personally wrote a letter of thanks. (Telegraph, 13th)</p>
<h3>Water Level of the Red River in Vietnam; Gradually Receding; Major Disaster Averted</h3>
<p>Hanoi: Recent floods on the Red River have turned the banks into swamps. Now the water level has receded slightly. The water level near here dropped to 10.97 meters this afternoon. Except for two small dikes at Baningtan and Pingtan being washed away, causing ten villages and thousands of acres of fertile land to be submerged, the main dikes remained intact. If the water level continues to decline, the dangerous period can be said to be over. (Havas, 12th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>A Comprehensive View of the World Situation</h3>
<p>Is the Far East situation merely a part of the overall world situation? Or is the entire world situation originating and ending in the Far East, with the Far East as its pivotal point? Taking a comprehensive view of the overall situation, we firmly believe that the Far East is where the center of gravity lies.</p>
<p>Judging from the current state of affairs: The biggest event in the overall situation is the German-Italian attack on Britain. As British Lloyd George recently stated: "The attack on Britain has not truly begun; but the struggle against the British Empire has undoubtedly already commenced. The biggest target of the German-Italian attack is the British Empire, which occupies one-fifth of the earth's surface, and the attack on the British Isles is only a part of it." The British Isles are the headquarters of the British Empire, but the center of gravity of the empire is not actually in the British Isles, but built on its exclusive dominance of world sea power. Therefore, if Germany and Italy want to crush the British Empire, they must inflict a fatal blow on the British navy, which maintains its maritime hegemony. However, the navies of Germany and Italy, even if added to part of the French navy that can be coerced, are still not enemies of the British navy. Therefore, Germany and Italy are weakening the strength of the British navy through aerial bombardment and submarine attacks, while at the same time wooing maritime allies to help them, and Japan is a relatively good target. On the German-Italian side, whether the Japanese navy participates in the war must be a condition for Germany and Italy to recognize Japan as an allied country. On the Japanese side, burdened by the Sino-Japanese War, it cannot and does not want to add the navy to the German-Italian front and make an isolated gamble that cannot be won. As for Britain, although it does not think that Japan joining the German-Italian front would be something the British navy cannot handle, it does not want to allow Japan to increase the weight of Germany and Italy. The German-Italian and British pursuit of Japan at sea is the extent to which Japan wants to use diplomatic maneuvering to the fullest extent with Germany and Italy. If the world situation simply evolved in this way, Germany and Italy would inevitably compete to add value, and the inevitable limit of the competition would be the inevitable limit of Japan's diplomatic maneuvering, and the world situation in the near future would also use this saturation point as the axis of development. However, the overall situation is not that simple, because there are also complex and far-reaching Far East issues at the same time; and surrounding the Far East issues, there are still three sets of diplomatic functions: British-American, American-Soviet, and Soviet-British, which can have a profound impact on Japan's future with Germany and Italy and Britain; not only that, France's Far East policy also has very subtle points in the overall world situation. From this point of view, it cannot be said that the Far East situation is only a part of the overall world situation, that is, it cannot be said that the Far East situation is waiting for the decision of the overall world situation.</p>
<p>To put it simply, changing a point of view, please examine the overall situation from the Far East: the biggest event in the Far East is of course the Sino-Japanese War. For Japan, it has hoped for a quick victory from the beginning, that is, it hopes to complete everything through military means; this has been the case for three years, and now the so-called all-out effort to resolve the incident means the same, and it is even more urgent. The difference is that three years ago, it was confident and acted alone; now, it focuses on third countries, wanting to completely cut off China's overseas access; it is gradually encroaching on Hong Kong, Macau, Guangzhou Bay, Vietnam, and Burma, and has achieved temporary success to varying degrees. These kinds of successes do not have any successful factors themselves, but because the British and French themselves have defects; the Soviet Union itself has no defects, so the land route between China and the Soviet Union must always be unimpeded, and Japan must not make ineffective attempts against the Soviet Union. Even in terms of what Japan has temporarily succeeded in, it will of course cause temporary inconvenience to China, but it cannot achieve the desired effect, because China does not stop the War of Resistance due to this temporary inconvenience in actual action. What's more, following Japan's temporary success: First, any country with a stake in the Far East more clearly understands the insatiable nature of Japan's expansionist desires; Second, France is reconsidering its compromise policy and choosing between abandoning and resisting; Third, Germany is considering whether to simply give Japan a free lunch and reap the benefits without any effort; Fourth, Britain resolutely makes all preparations for any eventuality due to the pain of experience; However, the United States feels that the flames have indeed approached the Philippines' doorstep, accelerating the advancement of its firm policy; It also gives China a good opportunity to obtain a favorable new battlefield to disperse Japanese forces and develop a strategy of attrition. Therefore, Japan's temporary success is by no means a continuation of success and an increase in the results of the war; on the contrary, it makes the Far East issue more complicated and increases Japan's difficulties. The essence of the European War is Germany and Italy against Great Britain; while the Far East is evolving into a situation where most countries are against Japan.</p>
<h3>China Air Force Authorities Announce; The Air Force's Progress Over the Past Three Years; Hoping the People of the Country Will Assist in Aviation Construction; Hoping Overseas Chinese Will Contribute Human and Financial Resources</h3>
<p>Chongqing: The Chinese Air Force authorities, on the occasion of Air Force Day today, announced the progress of the Chinese Air Force over the past three years, stating briefly that on August 14th three years ago, the Chinese Air Force fought and won against the elite Japanese Kisarazu Air Group in the skies over Jianqiao, Hangzhou, creating a new era. At that time, the courage and heroism shown by the emerging Chinese Air Force shocked people around the world. In the past three years, all officers and soldiers of the Air Force have continued to maintain this glorious victory and have developed a more courageous and heroic fighting spirit, and have created many amazing results. In order to win glory for the great Chinese nation and to meet the greater and more enthusiastic expectations of the compatriots across the country, all officers and soldiers of the Air Force are determined to die and charge, bomb, and demand compensation in the rain of blood and iron. According to the numbers that have been confirmed, a total of 848 Japanese aircraft have been shot down, 1,148 Japanese Air Force personnel have been killed, 40 Japanese warships have been sunk, and more than 154 Japanese warships have been damaged, including two aircraft carriers, severely injuring Japanese Air Force personnel, including one Air Force Major General and one Navy Vice Admiral, and dozens of famous figures in the aviation industry. In addition, the millions of leaflets dropped on the expedition to Tokyo are still imprinted in the minds of the Japanese people. These facts are immortal honors in history. Recently, the Japanese concentrated a large number of aircraft in June and July to attack the capital and various undefended cities in Sichuan. This behavior, in addition to consuming oil and bombs (16,574,660 yuan) and losing soldiers (74 people), besides increasing China's determination to build a strong Air Force, it fully gave the Chinese Air Force soldiers even better opportunities to be loyal to the country and filial to the nation and to perform their meritorious deeds. As for the work of building the Air Force, there has been amazing progress in the past three years. At present, the Chinese aviation industry has established a considerable foundation. The training of Air Force cadres is constantly being developed, and aviation national education is also being promoted and implemented. These kinds of facts are enough to prove that the work of building the Chinese Air Force is moving forward bravely. In these three years of the War of Resistance, in terms of combat, the Chinese Air Force has established immortal honors in history, and in terms of building the army, it has established an unshakable foundation. Now, in addition to sincerely and respectfully thanking the President for creating the Air Force and training the Air Force, the enthusiastic contributions of compatriots across the country to the Air Force must not be forgotten. In the past three years, in terms of both manpower and financial resources, compatriots across the country have made their greatest efforts. Millions upon millions of donations, countless comforts, countless comfort items, and thousands upon thousands of young people who have joined the Air Force, and the hardworking airport personnel, these direct and indirect contributions of material and spiritual contributions to help the Air Force in combat and construction will never be forgotten. At present, the great cause of the War of Resistance and national construction has reached the most difficult and arduous stage, and it is also the stage where final victory and success are about to come. The President repeatedly instructed at the closing of the Seventh Plenary Session of the Central Committee that we should always be prepared for the arrival of the most serious and difficult times, because in the cause of revolutionary national construction, the closer it is to the final stage of success, the more difficult and arduous it will inevitably be. The officers and soldiers of the Air Force are abiding by these truths, preparing, and further sharpening their efforts to break through the highly difficult obstacles that will inevitably come with the most tenacious and strong efforts. At the same time, they also feel that the work of expanding the Air Force is more important and urgent. Recalling the great achievements of the national Air Force in combat in the past, which are the results of the construction of the Air Force, and the results of the construction of the Air Force are mostly based on the contributions of compatriots across the country in terms of money and efforts. Therefore, in order to ensure even greater achievements in the future, the work of expanding the construction of the Air Force must be expanded as much as possible. In order to expand the work of expanding the construction of the Air Force as much as possible, we must rely on compatriots across the country to make even greater contributions to the Air Force for the country and the nation. Therefore, on the occasion of the August 14th commemoration, we sincerely request: First, the physique of children and young people across the country should be strengthened, and scientific knowledge should be actively enriched, so as to be suitable for the standards of Air Force personnel in the future; Second, local natural resources should be actively developed, so as to assist in the development of the domestic aircraft manufacturing industry; Third, scientists and industrialists across the country should closely connect, and research and plan to develop China's aviation industry as much as possible; Fourth, national educational and cultural groups and individuals should intensify their efforts to popularize national aviation education; Fifth, and more importantly, compatriots across the country with abundant assets should donate aviation funds for national salvation tenfold more enthusiastically, in order to build a strong Air Force to win the final victory. In addition, we hope that the valuable deeds in the history of the construction of the Chinese Air Force will contribute manpower and financial resources ten times more to build a stronger Chinese Air Force.

<h3>New Tactics of the Japanese Air Force; No Military Value</h3>
<p>Chongqing: The Air Defense Command recently announced that when Japanese aircraft attacked Chongqing on Sunday, the Chinese fighter jets shot down five Japanese bombers and damaged six other aircraft. The communiqué stated that this new victory shows that Japan's new tactics have failed to achieve their expected results. It is said that if 81 aircraft attack Chongqing, then Japanese aircraft can avoid attacks by Chinese aircraft. This new tactic of the Japanese is intended to ensure mutual protection between Japanese aircraft and prevent intrusion by Chinese aircraft. Therefore, the flight of Japanese aircraft is often in several batches, and the formation of their columns is three miles wide, and the bombers are flying at an altitude of between 6,500 meters and 7,500 meters to avoid anti-aircraft guns. However, the Japanese aircraft implementing this new tactic cannot concentrate their attacks on any important target or any fixed part of the city. The bombs they drop are scattered everywhere. This kind of bombing has no military value and only harms civilians and property. (United Press, 13th)</p>
<h3>British Troops Stationed in Beiping Withdraw Yesterday; Rumor Says They Will Join Tianjin Troops to Hong Kong</h3>
<p>Beiping: A small guard unit from the British Embassy in Beiping, singing war songs, passed through the embassy district and began their journey.

The British troops then proceeded to the train station amidst the music played by the American troops and departed for Tianjin by train. American, French, and other military officers and diplomatic personnel, as well as British officials and citizens, also went to the station to see them off. (United Press dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>Tianjin: A spokesman for the Japanese army here stated to local newspapers that the British withdrawal of its troops stationed in North China has given the Japanese authorities here a favorable impression. He also said that the United States, France, and Italy should also withdraw their troops to avoid international friction. The spokesman further explained that he was requesting the withdrawal of foreign troops stationed in North China, not the withdrawal of foreign troops stationed in Shanghai. The spokesman continued that the Japanese military believes the British withdrawal is an act of British friendship, which is not only beneficial to China and Japan but also to Britain. The press then asked him to explain the reasons for this statement. The spokesman replied that Britain originally sent troops to China to protect the world from Chinese aggression, but since the Japanese army can maintain order in North China, the British troops are weak and unnecessary. He added that the Japanese believe this move by Britain demonstrates that it trusts the Japanese army's ability to protect foreign interests. The spokesman also stated that Japan has no intention of taking over foreign concessions, but if the British authorities request Japanese assistance to protect the concessions, the Japanese may be willing to extend their assistance. The Japanese will not intervene unless absolutely necessary. This morning at 10:30 AM, British Army Commander Major General Dowling visited the Japanese Garrison Commander Honma to bid farewell, and they talked for forty-five minutes. At 2:30 PM, French Army Commander in China, General Isotti, visited Dowling and talked for one and a half hours. (United Press dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>Beiping: According to semi-official Japanese sources, the British troops stationed in Beiping are the first to withdraw from North China today. Forty of the fifty guards from the British Embassy here left Beiping for Tianjin at 4:10 PM today, carrying all their military equipment. They will join the 120 British troops stationed in Tianjin and depart from Tianjin on August 15th, reportedly heading to Hong Kong. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>Tianjin: A Japanese military spokesman, in response to questions regarding the British military withdrawal from North China, stated that the Japanese authorities have a favorable impression of the British expression of confidence in Japan's ability to protect foreigners. He believes that other troops should also withdraw from North China to avoid international friction. When asked whether the Japanese army would patrol British areas, the spokesman replied that if the British authorities make such a request, the Japanese would be happy to comply. He also claimed they would not interfere unless circumstances require. British Army Commander Major General Dowling visited Japanese Commander General Honma this morning to bid farewell. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>Washington: The Washington Daily News stated yesterday that Britain's withdrawal of troops stationed in China "will further lose its interests in the Far East." The newspaper said that although Britain's withdrawal of troops from China to Hong Kong or Singapore will increase the country's military strength, the first point that should not be misunderstood is that this move "directly falls into the Japanese scheme and puts the United States in a difficult situation." (United Press dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>Tianjin: According to semi-official Japanese sources, regarding rumors that the British planned to hand over the British military patrol area in North China to the American army after the withdrawal of troops, British Army Commander Major Dowling and the British Consul General solemnly denied this when they visited Japanese Army Commander Honma this morning.

<h3>Hong Kong Remits British War Fund</h3>
<p>Hong Kong: The British War Fund, initiated by the South China Morning Post, has reached over 1,250,000 today. Another 20,000 yuan has been remitted to London. The total amount remitted to London by the fund has now exceeded 80,000 British pounds. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Defense Actively Strengthened</h3>
<p>Hong Kong: Hong Kong is now painstakingly strengthening its defenses. As the atmosphere of war grows more urgent, the people of Hong Kong are earnestly paying attention to preparations and want to make Hong Kong a small England. Since the enactment of the military training act, British men who are not of Chinese origin are serving in local defense. Every morning, fully armed volunteers go out for full-day training. These volunteers must receive one day of training per week, and their employers do not make things difficult for them, as the government has the right to prevent employers from interfering. The number of Chinese personnel in the Volunteer Corps has greatly increased in the past few months, and people from Britain's allied countries have also joined the army. Those who perform necessary daily work or are over the age of volunteer soldiers also join the local defense force and receive rifle and machine gun training two nights a week. Therefore, even well-off company managers must be commanded by young soldiers, but everyone is willing to fulfill their responsibilities. The local defense force has also received the enthusiastic service of the volunteer team. The number of police reserves has also greatly increased, with many Chinese joining, volunteering to patrol for six hours a day in addition to their regular work. The other ambulance and women's nursing teams are also active and increasing their training courses. Barbed wire has been placed along the coast where landings are possible, with machine gun nests behind the wire. Defense is being prepared all the way to Kowloon. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Foreign Minister Discusses the Future of the Far East</h3>
<p>Tokyo: When Japanese Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka met with the press recently, he spoke about the future of the Far East, saying that the Japanese government will cooperate with various countries as much as possible to establish a new order in the Far East. The Japanese authorities are now preparing the necessary measures to establish a Far Eastern economic zone after the war and emphasized that the Chinese issue must be resolved early, but not in a compromising manner. The international situation must also be taken into account when resolving it. The result of the European war will inevitably bring about drastic changes in the world economy, so we must wait for the aftermath. (Haitong dispatch, 13th)</p>

<h3>German Air Offensive Becomes Increasingly Fierce; Major Battle Between British and German Air Forces; Eight Hundred Aircraft Fill the Sky; Italian Aircraft Participate for the First Time</h3>
<p>London: The largest air battle in history was deadlocked over the English Channel area late yesterday. Eight hundred British and German warplanes participated in the battle, and Italy was participating for the first time. As a result of yesterday's air battle, between forty-five and fifty German aircraft were shot down, and the number of heavily damaged aircraft was about the same. German bombing began at midnight, repeatedly attacking important British targets, including the Portsmouth naval base, merchant ship escort ships, airfields, and important coastal cities. It is widely believed that the nature of this air raid, the large number of German aircraft (estimated at over six hundred), and the attacks that have lasted for more than forty-eight hours all prove that this is the final preparation for the blitzkrieg that Germany has long promoted. More than seventy German bombers attacked a city on the southeastern coast of England at dusk, and other German aircraft flew over various parts of southeastern, northeastern, southwestern, and northwestern England and Wales at midnight. Although British officials admitted that there were some deaths, they were unable to immediately compile statistics. It is reported that although the bombing range was extremely wide and tens of thousands of bombs were dropped, the number of casualties was less than expected. This was the first time that the Italian Air Force participated in the air battle, and it is reported that several Italian Air Force personnel were captured. A British Air Ministry communique stated that nine British fighter planes were missing. The areas that suffered the greatest German attacks were Portsmouth, the Isle of Wight, Kent, and Sussex.

<p>London: Germany intensified its aerial blitzkrieg against the British Isles yesterday. Four hundred German aircraft invaded Britain yesterday. According to fragmentary news received up to 7:00 PM last night, German aircraft had bombed various towns in the interior of Britain. The number of civilian casualties yesterday was the highest since the outbreak of the war. According to unofficial statistics, there were thirty German aircraft off the southern and southeastern coasts of Britain. Neutral and British experts declare that they have not confirmed that Germany is preparing for a large-scale invasion of Britain. It is also impossible to confirm the rumors in the Balkans that Germany is preparing eight thousand small boats to cross the English Channel to attack Britain, but officials here have confirmed the news that the German army is building several large airfields in northern France. (United Press dispatch, 11th/12th)</p>
<p>London: A major air battle took place in the skies over the southeastern coast this morning. Although many anti-aircraft shells exploded in the clouds, the spraying of machine-gun fire was very obvious. According to an observer at the listening station, enemy aircraft flew in batches every two or three minutes, like waves coming in. Another observer said, "I saw aircraft filling the sky, there were hundreds of them." (Reuters dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>London: Last night, German aircraft were more active in several parts of England and the skies over Wales than before. Bombs fell in the southeastern, northwestern, and southwestern regions of England. However, many German aircraft flying over the sea hastily retreated when British fighter planes approached. German bombers attacked Wales yesterday morning for several hours. The bombs dropped on coastal towns damaged several houses and caused some deaths and injuries. Enemy aircraft were repeatedly driven away by anti-aircraft fire. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>Berlin: After the German Air Force began its intensified invasion of England on Sunday, it continued to carry out a terrible aerial attack yesterday. Sources close to German officials warned that this air raid "is just beginning." They said, "This air raid will continue or even become more terrible day by day." The Germans refused to state whether this air raid was the beginning of a "major invasion" of England. The German official news agency stated that Sunday's air raid on England was "the first step in Germany's air superiority." The news agency quoted military experts as saying that the attacks by German aircraft in the past two days have shown that Britain is unable to maintain its strong combat defense line along the coast. "This is the first sign of the collapse of British resistance." (United Press dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>Sixty-One German Aircraft Shot Down by the British</p>
<p>London: Official sources state that a total of sixty-one German aircraft were shot down during yesterday's air raid on the coast. The British lost thirteen fighter planes, one of whose pilots was rescued safely. According to brief reports, at least ten German aircraft were shot down in today's air raid. German aircraft fiercely attacked barrage balloons in a coastal city in the southeast, and two of them caught fire and fell. In a certain air battle, British Spitfire planes chased eight Junkers bombers and shot down two of them. Another one caught fire in a city on the southeast coast, destroying four houses. There were very few casualties. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>German Communique Claims 92 British Aircraft Destroyed</p>
<p>Berlin: This afternoon, the German military report stated that yesterday, the German Air Force attacked naval ports and airfields on the southeastern and southern coasts of England. Many bombs hit the Portsmouth naval base. The local power plant and the Thorquay shipyard caught fire. Many docks, piers, and patrol ships in the English Channel were hit. The air battle was extremely fierce, and as many as forty-three enemy aircraft were shot down. Airfields and aircraft factories in Manston, Canterbury, Hawkinge, and Lympe caught fire. In Manston, four British aircraft parked on the ground were destroyed, and another three were shot down during reconnaissance. Elsewhere, eight aircraft parked on the ground were also bombed. German aircraft also burned down two "barrage balloons" in Dover. As a result of this air battle, thirty enemy aircraft were shot down. German dive bombers attacked and bombed British convoys, sinking two merchant ships and setting another ship on fire. Last night, German bombers attacked ships and anti-aircraft gun emplacements in the Ouse and Cardiff. British aircraft dropped bombs in northern and western Germany last night, but did not cause significant losses to the German side. German anti-aircraft guns shot down four British aircraft. In total, ninety-two enemy aircraft were lost yesterday, of which twelve were destroyed on the ground, four were shot down by anti-aircraft guns, and the rest were destroyed in air combat. Twenty-four German aircraft are missing. (Haitong dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>British Isles Heavily Bombed</p>
<p>London: Officials announced that the German aircraft shot down in the coastal air battles around Britain yesterday, as far as is known so far, numbered thirty-nine. Nine British warplanes are also missing. Yesterday evening, after hearing explosions in the distance from a town on the southern coast, about twenty Spitfire British warplanes and Messerschmitt German planes were seen fighting in the town of Goden. At least one German aircraft was shot down. After a burst of gunfire, another German aircraft was seen wobbling and falling, landing in a vegetable field. The pilot has been found and injured. Moments later, from where the gunfire came, another German aircraft was seen falling. The pilot jumped out with a parachute and fell into the sea with the aircraft. The pilot was rescued by a lifeboat. Yesterday, another German aircraft crew member, fighting in southeastern England, suffered a severe leg injury. He landed with a parachute and was captured by farmers armed with guns and taken to the police station. Another German crew member jumped out and drowned in the sea. Someone driving a car saw a wounded German crew member landing and used a pistol to capture the crew member, took him home, and then handed him over to the police station. A joint communique from the Admiralty, the Air Force, the Ministry of Internal Security stated that German aircraft attacked England this morning, first bombing coastal areas of Exmouth, then a large number of German aircraft attacked the Isle of Wight and Portsmouth. A certain shipyard was attacked, and two docks and two harbor small boats were sunk. The Portsmouth train station was hit, and several buildings, including a brewery, were set on fire. Although German aircraft dropped many bombs, casualties were not heavy. A church and several civilian houses on the Isle of Wight were damaged, injuring several people. Reports have been received about the attacks on the coasts of Kent and Sussex. It is learned that several locations were bombed, and several British airfields were slightly damaged. Civilian houses were also hit, but casualties were very light. Enemy aircraft were fiercely attacked by British defense forces everywhere and suffered heavy damage. British defense force casualties were light. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>Germany Finds it Difficult to Gain Air Supremacy</p>
<p>London: A Reuters Air Force correspondent stated that the British Royal Air Force admits that the German air raids that began on Thursday have not yet reached the blitzkrieg tactics that Germany can use. The enemy aircraft formations that came during the day did not seem to exceed two hundred. It is estimated that the total number of German aircraft participating in the battle yesterday had increased to five hundred. Although the German Air Force is currently suffering heavy losses and the production of aircraft is hindered by British air raids, it still has a large number of aircraft available. It is now believed that Germany can dispatch a thousand aircraft a day to fight for air supremacy. However, after the British fighters repeatedly achieved great victories, Germany may find that this number is not enough to achieve its goal. The German aircraft's group air raids have so far been limited to the southeastern and southern coasts. The targets chosen by German bombers are limited to the effective range of activities of protecting fighters. If bombers fly in large numbers beyond this semi-circular diameter during the day, they will encounter very heavy blows. Even within this semi-circular diameter, the combat capability of British fighters is still incomparable to that of enemy fighters. Although the German new-type Heinkel 113 is faster than the Messerschmitt 110 or 109, it is still far inferior to the British Spitfire. It seems too early to say whether Germany intends to invade after the current large-scale air raids. Since the collapse of France, Germany has lost as many as 500 aircraft in air raids on England. Regarding the sea and air victories promoted by Germany, the responsible authorities here issued the following criticism. According to London, when the German General Headquarters reported on the air battles on Thursday, Sunday, and Monday, they admitted that German aircraft had only lost 55 aircraft, but the actual number was 187. The Germans claimed to have destroyed 234 British aircraft, but in reality, only 55 were destroyed. The Germans' false reports can be seen from this. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>British Aircraft Carry Out Daily Air Raids on German Territory</p>
<p>The Air Ministry announced that on Saturday night, British bombers again attacked German military targets, including oil factories and power stations in Schöningen and other places. On Sunday, British medium-sized bombers attacked the Guise Island flying port and other airfields during the day, dropping bombs accurately, causing many fires and explosions. A coastal aircraft shot down a German fighter plane patrolling the French coast, which crashed into the sea. On Sunday, British aircraft carried out a large-scale attack, losing only three aircraft.

<p>Britain Uses New Air Combat Weapons</p>
<p>London: Britain is currently processing and manufacturing a new type of cannon for the Royal Air Force to use. It is said that this weapon is superior in speed to those used by the German Air Force. As for its style, range, and rate of fire, the authorities naturally keep it secret. British aircraft are now equipped with at least one type of cannon, but as far as warplanes are concerned, the British Air Force still prefers the Browning machine gun network. This machine gun network has a total of eight guns, four on each wing, which fire armor-piercing rounds and tracer rounds at a rate of 160 rounds per second. According to experts, firing this type of machine gun in a three-second burst creates a deadly fire net. When enemy and enemy aircraft gradually approach each other at a rate of more than 12 miles per minute, shooting must be rapid and accurate. Therefore, pilots of British Hurricane and Spitfire aircraft wait until enemy aircraft are close before firing. Because the range is short, the concentrated and flowing bullets penetrate the steel armor, as if piercing a piece of butter. The cannons used by the German Air Force, according to British experts, have not reached perfection since the beginning of the war. The German cannon is the Madsen 20mm, which fires shells weighing three-tenths of a pound at a rate of four per second. German Messerschmitt aircraft are still testing it. The range of the Madsen cannon is 600 yards, which is better than the Browning machine gun, but because the shooting is not accurate, the advantages and disadvantages offset each other. As for Britain's new cannon, the Air Ministry began experimenting with it in 1920. After twenty years of research, the current results have been achieved.

<h3>Unrest in Albania Continues; Locals and Italian Troops Engage in Fierce Battles; Southern Government Says It Has Not Heard Anything</h3>
<p>London: According to a Reuter's dispatch from Zurich last night, as a result of the fierce battle between Italian troops and Albanian locals, more than 400 people were killed and injured. It is reported that the most fierce battles are currently taking place in northern Albania. The Italian authorities are now unable to resist the rebels' riot, so the rebellion is developing vigorously. (International News dispatch, 13th)</p>

<h3>Italian-Greek Discord; Italian Questions Greek Protests Regarding the Assassination of Hoggia</h3>
<p>Athens: Officials here yesterday denied the Italian claim that Albanian patriot Hoggia was assassinated by Greeks near the Greek-Albanian border. According to Greek documents, Hoggia was a well-known bandit, not a patriot, and he was killed by two Albanians two months ago. After the assassination, they crossed the border into Greek territory and were subsequently arrested. The Italian Embassy in Greece issued a note to the Greek Foreign Minister on July 25 stating that the Albanian Minister of Justice would soon formally request the Greek government to extradite them, but the Greek government has not yet received this request. It has been found that Hoggia committed repeated crimes twenty years ago. As for the Italian claims that the murderers carried Hoggia's head to show it in various villages, they are all untrue. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>Rome: According to authoritative sources here last night, Italy will protest to Greece regarding the assassination of Hoggia, who advocated for the return of lost territories in Albania, by Greeks in Albanian territory. The Rome People's Daily said in an afternoon edition when discussing Hoggia's assassination, condemned Greece for undermining its neutral status and openly assisting Britain by providing gasoline to its aircraft and warships in Greece. It is reported that after Hoggia was assassinated by the Greeks, his body was transported across the Albanian border into Greece in hopes of receiving a reward because the Greek government had offered a reward for Hoggia's head. The Italian news agency Stefani stated that Hoggia advocated that Greece should return the Ciamuria province, which it annexed in 1913, to Albania. The news agency condemned Hoggia's attempt to place the province in a stateless situation. This evening, newspapers here continued to pay attention to this incident, saying that this was clear evidence of Greek aggression. The headline of the Italian Daily was "Greece's Oppression of the Entire Ciamuria Region." Other newspapers' headlines and reports all called Hoggia an "old patriot and an extraordinary promoter of Ciamuria's freedom." (United Press dispatch, 13th)</p>

<h3>Railway Negotiations Between Finland and the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Helsinki: The first round of railway negotiations between Finland and the Soviet Union concluded yesterday in Moscow. Draft agreements on through traffic between Finland and the Soviet Union and on connecting the Hanko railway were prepared. It was decided that the negotiations would continue shortly. It is reported that the Finnish side has largely completed preparations for various technical aspects of through traffic with the Soviet Union. It is also learned that the instruments of ratification for the commercial agreement concluded between Finland and the Soviet Union in early July were exchanged here yesterday. Both sides expressed their efforts to promote trade between the two countries. (Haitong Telegraph, 13th)</p>
<h3>Significant Reform of the Soviet Red Army System</h3>
<p>Moscow: In view of the fact that the People's Commissar for Political Affairs of the Red Army has completed its basic work, and that the number of cadres in the Red Army and Navy has also increased in recent years, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union has made the following decisions in order to unify command and organization, enhance the prestige of the military, and ensure the complete political training of command personnel:</p>
<p>(1) Abolish the legal system of political commissars in the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army (this system was approved by the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet People's Commissariat on August 15, 1937).</p>
<p>(2) Establish deputy commanders for political affairs in each division, brigade, military school, and Red Army naval unit.</p>
<p>(3) The military councils of each district, front line, and army group shall be fully responsible for political work in each army, division, and brigade. (TASS Dispatch, 13th)</p>
<h3>Former British Secretary of State for War Advocates Training an Army of 100 Divisions to Invade Continental Europe for Ultimate Victory</h3>
<p>London: Former Secretary of State for War Hore-Belisha, in a speech in Tamworth last night, advocated training an army of several million men, saying that Britain must plan to invade enemy-occupied territory, otherwise we will not be able to achieve ultimate victory. Therefore, preparations should be made to train an army of at least 100 divisions, equipped with the best recent combat experience and attached aviation units. Currently, British industrial mobilization has not yet reached a complete state. This situation cannot be allowed to continue for long, because the 800,000 unemployed in the country will not be able to defeat Germany. The task of the British economy is to mobilize all productive capacity and fully utilize it. The production of goods for pure consumption should be reduced as much as possible to meet the essential needs of the people. Export trade should be encouraged as much as possible to pay for Britain's necessary imports. The remaining industries should be devoted day and night to the production of war materials. (Reuters Dispatch, 13th)</p>
<h3>General de Gaulle's Broadcast Address</h3>
<p>London: General de Gaulle, head of the French National Committee in Britain, broadcast to the world last night, saying that when France was misled and surrendered by the Vichyites, it still possessed strong combat instruments. It was the enemy's cunning schemes and the lies of collaborators that ultimately led France to sign a shameful armistice. However, the weeks following the armistice have been sufficient to show the guilt of those who advocated surrender at the time. When France laid down its arms, it still had the entire navy, second in Europe, a great air force, and vast colonies. Britain was also actively engaged in the army, navy, and air force, and the United States was undertaking to support the Allied countries with its powerful arms manufacturing capacity. All of this is the opposite of what the moribund Vichyites said. Now it can be seen that what the Germans want is to destroy France in both material and spiritual terms, so that they can more easily enslave the French. France can have no hope for the enemies who hate France and the old men who betray France. Therefore, the path we are now taking is the right one, without a doubt. Nothing is more gratifying to us than this. (Reuters Dispatch, 13th)</p>

<h3>The British Admiralty Announces Merchant Ship Losses; Actual Number is Only Over 70,000 Tons</h3>
<p>London: German propaganda claims that in the week ending August 5, Britain lost a total of 232,743 tons of merchant shipping. However, according to the Admiralty's announcement after verifying the figures for merchant ship losses of Britain and neutral countries, the actual number is only 75,124 tons, including 13 British ships, 60,058 tons, one Allied ship, 12,985 tons, and one neutral ship, 13,768 tons. As of August 12, Germany had lost a total of 923,000 tons, Italy 259,000 tons, and in addition, 29,500 tons of ships that were formerly neutral and are now under German control were also lost.

<h3>Uruguayan Nazi Leader Fuhrmann Arrested; Known as the "Head of South America"</h3>
<p>New York: The New York Times' dispatch from Buenos Aires reports that the so-called "Head of South America," Fuhrmann, was arrested on Sunday night in Concordia, on the Uruguayan bank of the Uruguay River, on the border between Argentina and Uruguay. This arrest was requested by the Buenos Aires police department. It is expected that the Argentine government will order his expulsion. Previously, the Argentine government had identified the German national Arnhold as an important member of the German secret police and ordered his deportation. Earlier, a Uruguayan parliamentary committee investigating Nazi activities seized documents from Fuhrmann's residence detailing Germany's plan to seize Uruguay by force and make it a colony. Fuhrmann admitted that he had drafted the plan, but said it was only a joke. Although the German ambassador to Uruguay issued a statement disavowing it and saying that Fuhrmann was a mentally unsound Argentine citizen and should not be taken seriously, letters seized by the Uruguayan police proved that Fuhrmann was one of the most powerful Nazi leaders in Uruguay, and frequently communicated with Nazi leaders in Germany.

<h3>Italian Newspaper Attacks the Pétain Government, Accusing it of Deceiving the Axis Powers</h3>
<p>Rome: The "Fascist Regime" newspaper, controlled by Farinacci, attacked French Premier Pétain and Deputy Premier Laval yesterday, saying that the two intended to make the Vichy government superficially close to the totalitarian regime in order to deceive the Axis powers. The newspaper commented on a recent editorial published in the widely circulated French weekly "Marianne," saying, "The French in the German-occupied zone are now looking forward with unease, because a few 'self-styled' individuals are again poisoning public opinion. This clever phenomenon can be found in the areas ruled by Marshal Pétain and Laval. Furthermore, the resumption of the popular French weekly 'Marianne' can also be seen as evidence. The first editorial of the weekly after the signing of the armistice adopted an anti-totalitarian stance, and said that this attitude would become the general trend in France." The "Fascist Regime" newspaper cited the editorial of the weekly "Marianne" as proof, which accused the French people of not abandoning traditional "social democracy" and declared this a cowardly act. The Italian newspaper said, "If anyone can remember that there is still a strict censorship system in France, then he must admit that the remarks published by the weekly 'Marianne' are indeed crucial. We believe that after a few months, un-occupied France will have the possibility of returning to a Judaized and 'Masonic' political system. At this point, our suspicions about the Vichy government will be correct. In fact, the tone of the weekly 'Marianne' is indeed very accurate, because no one can change the minds of 40 million French people in 45 hours. Laval knows this very well, but he hopes that the Pétain government can use this to deceive the Axis countries, but the result is that the hope is very slim." (United Press)</p>
<h3>Romanian-Bulgarian Preparatory Negotiations Encounter New Complications; Romania Accepts the Hungarian Memorandum; Negotiations Between the Two Countries Are About to Begin</h3>
<p>Sofia: Well-informed sources here announced last night that the preparatory negotiations between Bulgaria and Romania are now being delayed. King Carol received the Romanian special envoy Catargi. Romanian Minister to Bulgaria Filloti met with Bulgarian Foreign Minister Popov on the 10th, delivered the reply to the Bulgarian memorandum, and expressed the Romanian government's willingness in principle to cede Southern Dobruja, but requested that the city of Silistra on the Danube River and the port of Balchik on the Black Sea remain within Romanian territory. It is said that the Bulgarian government replied that it could not accept this counter-proposal, considering it inconsistent with Bulgaria's moderate demands. Therefore, the planned direct negotiations will not begin as scheduled. Before receiving a new reply from Romania, the Bulgarian delegation will not depart for the time being. At the same time, the proposal to convene a special session of the Bulgarian parliament will also be postponed. (Haitong Telegraph, 13th)</p>
<p>Budapest: According to an official announcement here, Romania accepted Hungary's memorandum on the issue of territorial cession on the 9th of this month. A Hungarian-Romanian conference will be held in Romania in the near future. The Hungarian delegation will be led by Horthy. (Haitong Agency, 13th)</p>
<p>Bulgaria Receives Strong Support from the Soviet Union for the Return of Southern Dobruja</p>
<p>Moscow: Regarding the issue of the return of Southern Dobruja to Bulgaria, Izvestia and Pravda both published articles saying, "European newspapers are now paying attention to Bulgarian-Romanian relations, especially regarding the issue of Southern Dobruja, which originally belonged to Bulgaria but was later seized. It is said that the Bulgarian side is demanding the return of Dobruja very urgently, and has submitted a formal request to the Romanian government, that is, if the entire Dobruja cannot be returned to the Bulgarian side, at a minimum, the southern part of the region must be returned to its original owner. According to Bulgarian official statistics, Bulgarians account for the majority of the population of Southern Dobruja. Romanians in the region account for only two percent. Bulgarian public opinion generally believes that Southern Dobruja must belong to Bulgaria. This has been explained by the materials published by the press section of the Bulgarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In the seventh century, Dobruja belonged to Bulgaria. In 1878, it was under Turkish control, but according to the Treaty of San Stefano on March 3 of the same year, Northern Dobruja was merged into Romania. In 1913, Romania further took advantage of Bulgaria's weakness after the Second Balkan War to occupy Southern Dobruja. On August 10 of the same year, Bulgaria and Romania signed an agreement in Sofia, formally merging Southern Dobruja into Romania. In 1916, during the First Imperialist War, the Bulgarian army assisted the German-Austrian allied forces in the war and occupied Southern Dobruja. According to the German-Romanian Treaty of 1918, Southern Dobruja should be returned to Bulgaria immediately. However, finally, according to the Treaty of Neuilly on November 27, 1919, the Bulgarian-Romanian border remained unchanged and there were no changes. After the First Imperialist War, the Romanian authorities tried their best to Romanianize Southern Dobruja. In 1924, the Romanian authorities enacted a law declaring the confiscation of one-third of the land in Southern Dobruja, to be reserved for Romanian immigrants. At that time, the Bulgarian people in the area unanimously expressed their opposition. The Romanian authorities then used military force to suppress the people, and even established military assassination squads in the village of Senovo. The result of this Romanianization effort has led most farmers to leave Southern Dobruja. In view of the above facts, Bulgaria's demand for the return of Southern Dobruja must be considered extremely fair. The Soviet Union will continue to maintain its attitude of supporting the Bulgarian demand." (TASS Dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>Sofia: After Bulgarian Minister to the Soviet Union Stamenov returned here on the 10th of this month, Bulgarian Minister to Turkey Schwarkilov also returned home yesterday to report important events to the government.

The German army's horse losses were 1.3 percent in Poland and 1 percent in the first phase of the Western Campaign. (Haitong Telegraph, 13th)</p>
<h3>Germany's Torpedo Boats</h3>
<p>Haitong News Agency Dispatch: After German Führer and Supreme Commander of the Army, Navy, and Air Force Adolf Hitler accepted the request of Grand Admiral Raeder, Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, and awarded the Iron Cross to Captain Paul, commander of the torpedo boat flotilla, the public has paid attention to the torpedo boats, which have recently achieved many remarkable feats. These torpedo boats sank a Norwegian torpedo boat during the Norwegian campaign and escorted ships transporting troops and supplies to Norway. In the recent seven attacks on the British coast, they sank four British destroyers, as well as many merchant ships, transport ships, and oil tankers. Torpedo boats are small and fast ships, agile in action, and carry very few sailors. If there are losses, they are easy to replenish. Moreover, the ship's body is very small, and it is not easy for the enemy to detect them at night. They can approach large ships and attack them. Therefore, the principle of torpedo boats is "small sacrifice, large harvest." As the speed of various warships gradually increases, torpedo boats have had to slightly increase their tonnage in order to increase their speed. During combat, they also adopt a concentrated firing formation from a greater distance. Their mission is still to attack enemy destroyers and torpedo boats, pursue submarines, undertake reconnaissance work, lay mines near enemy coasts, and protect merchant ships and transport ships. During the last World War, an Italian torpedo boat hid next to a small island in the Adriatic Sea on a foggy morning and suddenly destroyed a new type of battleship of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Navies of various countries began to pay attention to the effectiveness of torpedo boats. The Mediterranean Sea only requires smaller torpedo boats, while the North Sea and the Baltic Sea have larger winds and waves. Germany has built larger torpedo boats. The tactics of new torpedo boats are to approach enemy ships at a slower speed, and after being detected and releasing torpedoes, to escape at the highest speed and take a tortuous route to make it difficult for enemy ships to aim and fire. The English Channel has very small winds and waves, and the narrowest part between Dover and Calais, outside the mouth of the Thames River, is often where torpedo boats achieve success. The English Channel has many beaches, and large ships must take prescribed routes. Therefore, after attacking enemy ships, torpedo boats can travel between the beaches without fear of pursuit by enemy ships. During the war against Britain, torpedo boats will achieve even greater feats.</p>

<h3>The August 13th Anniversary Passed Silently; Citizens' Morale is Even More Inspired; Calm Self-Awareness Engaged in Local Efforts; Steadfast Belief Welcoming Unlimited Brightness; Special Alert Expected to be Lifted This Morning</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the third anniversary of the Songhu Anti-Japanese War. The whole city passed it peacefully in a solemn and respectful state. Recalling the rapid changes in the world over the past three years, the commemorative situation for this glorious and brilliant day of national resistance has also been different each year. This situation is due, on the one hand, to the daily decline of the concession environment, and on the other hand, to the fact that the majority of Chinese people have accumulated three years of great and arduous experience. Their belief in victory is even more steadfast, and their concept of resistance has shifted from superficial enthusiasm to inner calmness. Temporary excitement is easily replaced by long-term perseverance. At this time and in this place, all those who are even slightly self-aware are calm and silent, working hard and diligently, seeking to contribute to the work of resistance and construction. Yesterday, the Chinese in this city also knew how to restrain their emotions, act with reason and knowledge, and conduct a silent and solemn spiritual memorial ceremony, donating money to help the victims and collecting winter clothes, each contributing their ability and doing their best. Chinese-operated amusement parks, cinemas, and other commercial institutions all stopped business. At 12 noon, all public and private groups, institutions, and most families, under the leadership of the host or head of the family, stood in silence for three minutes to mourn and pay tribute to the loyal souls of the martyrs who sacrificed in the war of resistance, and also to swear to persevere to the end and strive for victory. The details are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>Strict Alert, No Incidents Occurred</p>
<p>The special alert jointly implemented by the police authorities of the two concessions in recent days reached its most stringent level yesterday. To strengthen police efficiency, all mobilized police personnel in the two concessions increased the number of guards stationed at the gaps in various roads yesterday, and intensified the inspection of pedestrians and vehicles. Patrols were also very active everywhere. In addition, the two concessions had mobile teams of seven or eight patrolmen who cruised the important roads, at any time ordering buses and other vehicles to stop and conducting the most stringent searches. The police officers stationed at the barbed wire fences blocking various roads were increased to two yesterday. Armored vehicles and security vehicles traveled everywhere all day long, strengthening the defensive power of various strongholds. As for the iron gates of the French Concession adjacent to Nanshi, they remained open as usual yesterday, but the number of pedestrians entering and exiting has decreased. Thanks to the full-day strict alert by the two concessions, yesterday was fortunately passed peacefully. If there are no unexpected events today, this special alert can be lifted at 8:00 a.m. this morning.</p>
<p>Defense Army Patrolling, Spirits Radiant</p>
<p>The defense forces of various countries stationed in Shanghai also exerted their maximum strength yesterday to assist the concession authorities in maintaining order. The defense forces of the United States, Italy, and France patrolled their respective defense zones all day long. Although the British defense forces are about to withdraw and are eager to prepare, they seemed to make an effort yesterday to carry out alert work in their defense zone. They were in a tense mood and did not slacken all day long. At the time of their final farewell, they gave the people of Shanghai a good impression. As for the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, since Company A was dispatched yesterday, all members have been fully mobilized and assigned to various districts to carry out alert work. As for the White Russian Detachment of the Corps, which is now under the control of the police department, it patrols the area from Yuqiaqing Road to the Bund from time to time. All mobilized defense forces and volunteer corps, unless there are special needs, will also be fully demobilized and restored to their previous state this morning.</p>
<h3>工部局 Urges Citizens to Stay Home</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council issued a notice yesterday stating: "During this period of heightened security, the duties of the police and defense forces are extremely heavy. Furthermore, there are many who violate the curfew regulations, which further increases the burden of work. It is hoped that all citizens, during this period of heightened security, will remain indoors every day from midnight (12:00 AM) to 5:00 AM the following morning, so that the majority of police officers responsible for enforcing the curfew can be reassigned to other more important tasks."</p>
<p>Hongkou and Zhabei: Bleak Circumstances</p>
<p>Yesterday, Hongkou also remained under strict security throughout the day. Japanese military police teams of three to five patrolled various locations from time to time. Japanese soldiers were stationed at key points, heavily armed and ready for battle. Some Japanese shops displayed Japanese flags. However, most Chinese people, due to the special circumstances, remained silent in remembrance and expressed their feelings through practical actions, staying home as much as possible. As a result, the Hongkou district became deserted and the situation was extremely bleak. In Zhabei, near the "Municipal Government" and the North Railway Station, Japanese and puppet troops and police were heavily deployed, conducting thorough inspections, creating a sense of extreme unease. The once bustling areas around Baoshan Road and Qujiang Road are now reduced to ashes, overgrown with weeds. Only the barking of stray dogs punctuates this desolate and lifeless landscape. Recalling the situation before the Shanghai Battle, one cannot help but feel deeply saddened.</p>
<p>Most Riverside Piers Closed</p>
<p>Security along the Huangpu River is also very tight. All piers along the Bund, except for the Customs, New Customs, Roosevelt, and a few others, have been closed and sealed off. The piers that remain open are heavily guarded by the Shanghai Volunteer Corps and police. At the upstream of the Huangpu River and west of Suzhou Creek, the number of Japanese and puppet troops and police has also been increased to more than ten, and inspections of those coming ashore are extremely strict. Although traffic on the Huangpu River was not completely blocked yesterday, many people were wary and fearful, resulting in only a few small boats floating on the river, while other ships were nowhere to be seen, a desolate scene resembling a blockade. As for the bridges over Suzhou Creek and the northern district of Suzhou Creek, in addition to the British and Japanese defense forces maintaining strict security, the order was generally peaceful yesterday, and the entire day was able to pass without incident.</p>
<p>Curfew Restrictions Continue</p>
<p>From 6:30 AM to 7:30 AM yesterday morning, a Japanese military unit conducted a simulated battle in the Hongkou district. The sounds of explosions and machine guns were heard in succession, clearly audible in the western part of Shanghai. Most residents who had not been informed beforehand were awakened from their dreams and inquired about what was happening. After understanding the truth, they simply laughed it off. Curfew regulations are still strictly enforced. Regardless of whether they are Chinese or foreign citizens, anyone walking on the streets after 12:30 AM is taken to the police station and released at 5:00 AM the next morning. Yesterday, entertainment venues in the British and French Concessions of Shanghai were closed for the day in accordance with the authorities' orders. However, the nightlife venues in the "outer-limits" area of western Shanghai remained as noisy as usual. The special martial law measures during the third week anniversary of the Battle of Shanghai will be lifted this morning, but curfew restrictions will continue to be strictly enforced.</p>
<p>Various Markets Reopen Today</p>
<p>Shanghai's various trading markets were ordered to temporarily close on the anniversary of the Battle of Shanghai to prevent unfortunate incidents from occurring. A New Voice News Agency reporter inquired about the situation from various markets yesterday: (1) The Shanghai Rice and Tea Association market on the third floor of the Qinglian Pavilion at the corner of Fuzhou Road and Daxin Street, and the Grain, Oil, and Cake Trading Market on the second floor of 15 Edward Road, have both announced that they will be closed for "August 13th Anniversary" and will resume business as usual from the 14th. (2) The Securities Dark Market inside the Hankou Road Stock Exchange has been closed for one and a half days since the afternoon of the 12th and will resume auction from the 14th. (3) The Yarn and Flower Dark Market at Tonghe Guli on Ningbo Road has been temporarily closed for two days since the 12th and will resume trading from the 14th. (4) The Gold Dark Market was closed for one day due to the "August 13th Anniversary" through a public resolution. Due to settlement matters, a special exception was made to close the market in the afternoon of the 12th, so the gold market at the corner of Jiangxi Road and Renji Road will resume business from the 14th.</p>
<h3>Unrest in the Far East, Increased Insurance Premiums, London Has Already Notified</h3>
<p>Due to the unstable situation in the Far East, according to news from the insurance industry in Shanghai, the accidental and war risk insurance rates for maritime transport in the Far East are subject to London's instructions. However, the insurance industry in Shanghai has recently received a notice from London that insurance premiums for voyages to various ports in China, Japan, Hong Kong, and the Philippines have been increased across the board. The insurance rates depend on the situation in each location and are not uniform, but the percentage increase is between 30% and 50%.</p>
<h3>Shenhua Ship Robbed at Sea in Fujian, Three Days and Nights of Piracy, Passengers Kidnapped, Over One Million Yuan Stolen</h3>
<p>Since the Japanese Navy announced the blockade of the Zhejiang and Fujian coast, shipping has gradually ceased. However, Sanjiangkou in Fujian is still open for customs clearance. The British-owned Yilong Company, Fusheng Company, and the American-owned Weili Han manager Xin'an Na and other companies' ships are operating as usual. The Yilong Company's Shenhua ship, with a carrying capacity of about 3,000 tons, loaded a large amount of flour (more than 30,000 bags), hundreds of pieces of cotton yarn and foreign cloth, and a full complement of passengers from Shanghai on the morning of the 3rd of this month, heading to Sanjiangkou. At 11:00 AM on the 6th, it arrived outside Hanjiangkou North and saw Japanese warships anchored, so it continued to sail north.</p>
<p>Hanjiangkou North: Pirate Lair</p>
<p>At around 5:00 PM that afternoon, it anchored at a small port about 20 miles north of Hanjiangkou. The passengers on board were all local people from Quanzhou, so they were very familiar with the local situation. Seeing the Shenhua ship anchoring, the passengers immediately asked the captain to weigh anchor and move to another location, explaining that pirates were entrenched in the area and that anchoring was extremely dangerous. The captain (British) refused. After a while, five wooden motorboats were seen coming out of the port. The passengers panicked temporarily, but fortunately, the five motorboats left immediately, and things calmed down. The Shenhua ship then anchored there for the night. The next morning (the 7th), the Xin'an Na and Yongfeng ships were seen sailing north. The captain saw this and immediately weighed anchor and followed the two ships north.</p>
<p>Unable to Enter Port: Encountered Misfortune</p>
<p>However, there were Japanese warships stationed along the way, making it impossible to enter nearby ports. In the afternoon, the Shenhua ship still sailed back to the small port outside the sea where it had anchored the previous day. The passengers expressed their dissatisfaction, but the captain insisted on staying. On the morning of the 8th, another wooden motorboat sailed out of the port, flying a certain country's flag, carrying more than 50 soldiers, fully armed. When the passengers saw the motorboat sailing out, they asked the captain to weigh anchor and avoid it, but the captain still refused. Unexpectedly, the motorboat sailed straight towards them, and the captain realized that they had encountered misfortune, but it was too late. The pirates successively jumped onto the deck, took control of the pilot platform and the radio room, and ordered the crew and passengers not to move, then drove them into the cabins and began to loot.</p>
<p>Dense Pirate Boats: Unloading Cargo Daily</p>
<p>They loaded all the crew and passengers' luggage onto the motorboats and forced the crew and passengers onto the deck, searching and robbing everyone of the cash and jewelry they had with them. After the robbery was completed, they forced the captain to sail into the port. The place was surrounded by islands, with a port in the middle. After entering the port and anchoring, the pirate boat sounded its horn, and four or five barges came over. The pirates then opened the hatches and unloaded the cargo from the cabins onto the barges, ordering the crew to help with the unloading. The crew did not dare to refuse. In the evening, the pirates mistakenly identified the radio operator and the second driver as compradors. At the same time, several Jewish passengers were taken away. After questioning the radio operator and the second driver, the pirates realized that they were not compradors and released them back to the ship at dawn. The pirates then inquired about the location of the comprador. Fortunately, he was hidden very well at the time and was not taken away. Later, because the pirate barges were full, they ordered the ship to sail out of the port again to continue unloading cargo.</p>
<p>Japanese Warship Approached: Left Calmly</p>
<p>On the morning of the 10th, the Japanese warship Izumo anchored nearby and sent a motorboat over. The pirates saw it, got off the ship, and left, but without any panic. After the Japanese warship's motorboat docked, Japanese officers and soldiers boarded the ship, briefly inquired about the robbery situation, and took away five or six pirates who had been left behind, ordering the Shenhua ship to leave. They immediately weighed anchor. The captain initially planned to sail back to Shanghai, but after suffering this robbery, the passengers had no money left to maintain themselves in Shanghai, so they asked the captain to sail to a nearby port so that they could disembark. Therefore, they sailed south towards Hanjiangkou. However, because there were Japanese warships in every port, they could not anchor, so they decided to sail back to Shanghai on Saturday morning.</p>
<p>Returned to Shanghai in Distress: Robbed Clean</p>
<p>They arrived in Shanghai at 8:00 PM the day before yesterday (the 12th) and docked at the Longmao Warehouse pier in Pudong. The ship had been hijacked for three days, and three-quarters of the cargo had been robbed. The luggage and belongings of the passengers and crew, as well as the cash and jewelry they had with them, were all stolen. Several Jewish passengers were kidnapped and their whereabouts are unknown. The estimated loss is more than one million yuan. The captain, chief mate, comprador, and others of the ship have drafted a report and reported it to the company. The company will forward the report to the British Consulate in the coming days. As for the passengers who arrived in Shanghai, because they were penniless and unable to disembark, some were visited by relatives and friends, while others remained on board, waiting for the aftermath to be dealt with.</p>
<h3>Japan Expands Blockade, Eight Coastal Ports, Shanghai-Fujian Shipping Inevitably Cut Off Completely, Foreign Ships Will Return to Shanghai and Cease Operations</h3>
<p>Since the Japanese Navy announced the blockade of the coasts of Zhejiang and Fujian on the 26th of last month, including the coasts of Wenzhou, Zhenhai, Fuzhou, Hanjiang, and Sazuo Ao, a month has passed in an instant. Yesterday, according to a reporter from Daguang News Agency who inquired from the shipping industry, the Japanese side has continued to announce that it will expand the blockade of the coasts of Fujian and Zhejiang from the 15th of this month. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Blocked Ports</p>
<p>The shipping industry learned that the Japanese Navy suddenly notified the consulates of various countries yesterday, informing the shipping companies that, starting from the 15th of this month, the blockade of Fujian and Zhejiang will be expanded, prohibiting ships from traveling to the following ports: (1) Haiping, (2) Zha Yong, (3) Shenhu Yong, (4) Shenhu Bay, (5) Xinghua Bay, (6) Meizhou Bay, (7) Xipu, (8) Quanzhou Port. When the Japanese side announced the blockade last month, coastal areas of Fujian province, such as Xinghua and Quanzhou, were not included, so they could still be navigated. Now that the Japanese side has expanded the blockade, Shanghai-Fujian shipping will inevitably be completely interrupted. It is reported that the Shenyou, Xin'an Na, Yongfeng, and other ships along the coast of Fujian will also return to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Difficult to Navigate to Zhejiang</p>
<p>Regarding the Zhejiang coast, Ningbo has now been officially opened to navigation. However, the Changde ship, which sailed to Ningbo on the 7th, did not enter Aojiang until the evening before last. Unloading began yesterday. In addition, the British-owned Kellyton ship, which was originally scheduled to sail to Ningbo tomorrow, has decided to suspend its voyage due to the fact that ships are often inspected by Japanese warships and the route is not very smooth. In addition, the Far East Company's Hanna ship sailed from Shanghai to Aojiang on the morning of the 11th. It was inspected by a Japanese warship on the way but was immediately released and sailed to Aojiang. In addition, the German-owned Lihe Yanghang's Moufu ship, which was originally scheduled to sail to Aojiang at 8:00 AM on the morning of the 12th, was delayed due to loading cargo and did not depart until 6:00 AM yesterday morning. It is reported that in addition to loading cargo, the ship also carried hundreds of passengers.</p>
<p>Zhejiang Mail Arrives in Shanghai</p>
<p>After the interruption of Shanghai-Ningbo shipping, the exchange of mail has become a problem. Since Shanghai and Zhejiang discontinued shipping on the 16th of last month, Shanghai has not received mail from Baobo. Yesterday, a reporter from Datong News Agency learned that a large batch of mail from Ningbo and other places in eastern Zhejiang since the 16th of last month arrived in Shanghai yesterday, totaling more than 1,000 bags. Because it needs to be inspected by the Japanese side, it could not be distributed yesterday, but it is expected to be delivered separately starting today. This is the first batch of mail from Shanghai and Zhejiang to arrive in Shanghai after the interruption of shipping.</p>
<h3>Japanese Warships Shell Haimen Waters, More Than Twenty Shells</h3>
<p>Ningbo sent another telegram yesterday reporting on the situation after the recovery of Zhenhai. The following is a record: (1) At 8:09 AM the morning before last, a Japanese warship sailed into the Haimen waters and anchored near the Haimen blockade line. At 2:05 PM, the Japanese warship suddenly sailed into the blockade line and fired more than twenty shells at the coast of Haimen without a specific target. The losses are being investigated. (2) At 6:45 AM the morning before last, three Japanese aircraft were spotted over Baiguan, flying from southeast to southwest, passing through Zhuji, Yiwu, and Jinhua, and circling several times in Jinhua and Yiwu before flying back the same way. At 8:25 AM, nine Japanese aircraft were spotted over Zhuji. Within five minutes, another nine were spotted, all flying towards Changle, Jianyang, Yiwu, Xianju, Yongjia, and other places before escaping south. (3) The day before yesterday, Zhenhai Jiangnan, Xiepu, and Wenzhou were all shelled by Japanese warships, but there were no Chinese losses. Yesterday, when three Japanese aircraft flew low to attack Ningbo, Huizheng Lane and Nantang outside the South Gate, as well as Qilidian and other places in the city, were strafed with machine guns, but there were no deaths or injuries. Only many bullet casings were found on the spot.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Guangdong Airmail Suspended</h3>
<p>The Postal Administration announced that airmail flights between Shanghai and Guangzhou have been suspended. This bureau is temporarily suspending the sending of all airmail to Guangzhou. Superintendent Zha Peilin.</p>
<h3>News Briefs</h3>
<p>The Chinese Language Group of the French Concession Rent Investigation Committee was originally scheduled to hold its third joint meeting at the French Concession Taxpayers' Association at 8:00 PM yesterday. However, because yesterday was the anniversary of August 13th, it has been rescheduled to 8:00 PM this afternoon. The decision to hold the meeting on Tuesday as usual remains unchanged.</p>
<p>Small and large parcels to various parts of northern Jiangsu have been resumed. Large parcels are limited to 30 kilograms per piece. In addition to the posting fee of 15 cents per kilogram, a registration fee of 40 cents per piece will be charged. In addition, the acceptance of small and large parcels to and via Xinghua has been temporarily suspended. As for the small and large parcels previously accepted to various cities and counties in eastern Zhejiang, such as Shaoxing, Jinhua, Zhuji, Shangyu, Yuyao, Yiwu, Dongyang, Xianju, Xinchang, and Lanxi, the bureau has decided to find ways to transport them. The date of resumption of acceptance of small and large parcels to the above places is still pending the official resumption of Shanghai-Zhejiang shipping.</p>
<h3>Military Commanders of Various Countries to Meet Tomorrow to Discuss Defense Zone Issues, Held at Japanese Marine Corps Headquarters, Expected to Find an Appropriate Solution</h3>
<p>The English-language "Greater Shanghai Evening Post" reported that rumors of changes that will occur after the British army withdraws from Shanghai are rife in the city today (the 13th). However, officials are keeping silent. It is said that no changes are expected until the military commanders of various countries hold a meeting on Thursday to discuss and reach a resolution. This morning, it was widely rumored that more than 1,000 Japanese troops had entered the Hailar Palace gambling den on the Great West Road. However, after investigation, it was found that there were only a few Japanese soldiers in the gambling den, apart from two Japanese trucks. As for the rumor that the Russian Detachment of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps will take over the West Hongkou defense zone of the British High Ground Team today, it has also been verified as untrue. Rear Admiral Takeda of the Japanese Navy, commander of the Japanese Naval Landing Forces in Shanghai, convened a meeting of the military commanders of various countries on Thursday. This meeting may be held around noon at the Japanese Marine Corps Headquarters on North Sichuan Road to decide which country's troops will take over the British defense zone.</p>
<p>Japanese Military Authorities Notify Meeting</p>
<p>The "Continental Daily" reported, according to the Domei News Agency, that it was revealed last night (the 12th) that Rear Admiral Takeda of the Japanese Navy, commander of the Japanese Naval Landing Forces in Shanghai, in his capacity as chairman of the Shanghai Joint Defense Committee, suggested to the commanders of the garrisons of various countries yesterday that a meeting of the Joint Defense Committee be convened on Thursday to decide which country's defense forces will take over police duties in the British defense zone after the withdrawal of the British troops.</p>
<p>French Commander Will Also Attend</p>
<p>According to the Japanese-language "Continental News", the commanders of the defense forces of Britain, the United States, Italy, and Japan will meet on Thursday. The commander of the International Settlement's Shanghai Volunteer Corps and the French garrison, as well as representatives of the Japanese army authorities, will also attend and listen. The resolutions reached at this important meeting will be final. Before the meeting, the authorities will make preliminary preparations among the Japanese naval and army and diplomatic officials stationed in Shanghai to formulate a unified position and maintain close contact with the Japanese government.</p>
<p>British and American Sides Reach Understanding</p>
<p>During the meeting, the Japanese side will resolutely oppose any motion to allow American troops to patrol the British defense zone. When the British and American defense commanders held a private meeting before the British side formally announced the withdrawal of British troops stationed in Shanghai, they must have reached some kind of understanding. However, the Japanese side will firmly oppose the one-sided agreement between the British and American authorities. It is expected that the meeting on Thursday will be difficult to reach a proper solution.</p>
<p>Exact Date of Withdrawal Still Unknown</p>
<p>Regarding the date of departure and withdrawal of the British defense forces stationed in Shanghai, the British side is still keeping silent. However, it is known that the British troops stationed in Shanghai announced yesterday that they will broadcast music on XCEN radio station from 8:30 PM to 9:00 PM on Friday, the 16th. This is the first time that the British army has broadcast in the city and is also a farewell commemoration for the British troops who have been stationed in Shanghai for more than two years. Therefore, the British defense forces will begin to withdraw after the 16th of this month.</p>
<h3>British Naval Authorities Deny Withdrawal from China, Considering it Pure Rumors</h3>
<p>The "Continental Daily" reported that the rumor that the British Navy stationed in Chinese waters will withdraw along with the British Army was firmly denied yesterday (the 12th) by the British naval authorities in Shanghai. A senior British naval officer told reporters last night that he had never heard of this and that it must be pure rumors. According to news reports, a "responsible person" said that the British Navy stationed in China will closely follow the British Army and withdraw. Sources with good information claim that the New York Times telexed New York, predicting that the British Navy will withdraw from China, hence the above rumors.</p>

<h3>British Businessman Builds Houses in Wayside Area, Japanese Obstruct and Halt, Shanghai Municipal Council Receives Report, Does Not Recognize Japanese Building Regulations</h3>
<p>The "North China Daily News" reported that a British construction and real estate company has recently been building houses on its property in the Wayside area of the International Settlement. The Japanese side has demanded that the company comply with certain building regulations recently promulgated by the Binbei Japanese authorities. The company refused, causing the construction work to be halted. A reporter inquired with the Shanghai Municipal Council about this matter. A spokesman for the council admitted that the council had received a report on this matter.</p>
<p>However, he emphasized that the council will not tacitly allow any other building regulations to be implemented within its jurisdiction, except for the regulations that the council has already implemented. The council will not recognize any encroachment of power by other parties within the concession. The Japanese Consulate in Shanghai has issued regulations stipulating that any company conducting construction work in Hongkou and Binbei must first register with the Japanese Naval Landing Forces. However, as far as he knows, these regulations only apply to Japanese people, and this is the first time that the Japanese side has demanded that a British company comply with the above regulations. The Japanese authorities have not obstructed the regulations of the Shanghai Municipal Council, and the council has not received formal notification of the Japanese side's implementation of its building regulations. However, the council will not tacitly allow the implementation of the Japanese side's regulations. He believes that this incident involving the British company is due to a misunderstanding and can be resolved clearly. The council has never received formal notification of the Japanese side's regulations, so he believes that the Japanese side issued these regulations only for Japanese people. It is said that Japanese people report to the Japanese authorities first when building houses. There is no reason to believe that the Japanese authorities intend to take actions contrary to the council's regulations or attempt to replace the council's regulations with other regulations.</p>
<h3>Tram Conductor Pushes Passenger</h3>
<p>At 10:40 PM last night, French-owned Route 7 tram D-44, traveling from west to east, was at the West Xinqiao station. Passengers were disembarking one after another. Inside the third-class carriage, an elderly man from Zhenjiang, over sixty years old, was slow-moving due to his age, so he was the last to disembark. Just as his feet were stepping down, he was unexpectedly pushed by the ticket seller No. 367 on the tram, who closed the iron door immediately. Unable to support himself, the elderly man fell to the ground. It is said that he suffered a severe head injury and lost consciousness on the spot. Afterwards, nearby constables arrived and took the ticket seller to the police station for investigation. At the same time, they quickly summoned an ambulance to the scene and rushed him to Guangci Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Ordering Fountain Pens, Issuing Bad Checks, Worth Over 7,000 Yuan, Main Culprit at Large</h3>
<p>Cao Wenbo from Ningbo, the owner of Damei Fountain Pen Shop at 3 Donghua Lane, Fuzhou Road, previously ordered fountain pens worth 7,019 yuan from Shanghai Hufeng Fountain Pen Factory on Jiangxi Road. He paid with two checks from the West Ming Bank. When Hufeng went to cash them upon maturity, they were returned. Zheng Zixin, the legal representative of Hufeng, repeatedly urged Cao to pay the goods payment, but he always evaded. They were still negotiating at the New Capital Hotel the day before yesterday, but there was no result. Later, Zheng suddenly discovered that Cao had absconded, so he reported to the General Patrol Station, accusing Cao of fraudulently obtaining property. Chinese Detective Jin Deshun arrested a staff member from Ningbo, Lu Jixin, at the Damei shop at noon yesterday. Later, Cao's wife, Zhang, was also arrested at 3 Lane 16, South Wuxi Road, but Cao Wenbo was still not caught. This morning, Lu and Zhang were escorted to the criminal court of the First Special Court. Fang Fushu, the patrol station's lawyer, requested a postponement because the main culprit had not been caught. After Judge Shi interrogated them, he ordered them to be detained for a week for further questioning.</p>
<h3>British Man's Chinese Wife Accuses Brother of Assault, Transferring House and Occupying Belongings, Defendant Joined Portuguese Nationality and Refuses Summons</h3>
<p>Fang Yulan, a Cantonese woman, 31 years old, is married to Mr. Hee, a British employee of the Shanghai Municipal Council in the International Settlement, and lives with him in Room 41, 4th Floor, Race Course Apartment, Race Course Road. Recently, she hired lawyer Ge Zhaoji to act as her agent and filed a lawsuit with the criminal court of the Second Special Court, accusing her brothers Fang Gao. Yasipeng (23 years old) and Fang Gao. Edwen (22 years old, both living at 37 Lafei Lane, Lafei Road, and both senior employees in a foreign company)</p>
<p>Occupying Property</p>
<p>And committing assault, etc. Her prosecution stated that the accuser lost her father at the age of 25. At that time, the family was destitute. The accuser relied entirely on her work in a foreign company, and also worked as a teacher in her spare time, as well as being a private English tutor, using her salary to support her elderly mother and two younger brothers (i.e., the defendants). Until the defendants became adults, she recommended them to the foreign company where they now work as employees so that they could become self-reliant. In November 1935, for the sake of her elderly mother,</p>
<p>Contributed to Rent in Concession</p>
<p>House number 37, Lafei Lane, so that her elderly mother and two younger brothers could live in the house. The furniture and other items were also purchased by the accuser. Some of them were borrowed from others. When the accuser went to Japan with her husband to escape the summer heat on May 10 of this year, the second defendant secretly transferred the house to his own name. When the accuser returned to Shanghai, she moved to her mother's house on July 2 to retrieve items borrowed from others. The defendant forcibly prevented her and committed violence, biting the accuser's arm. She reported it to the police station</p>
<p>The injury can be verified</p>
<p>Therefore, she should be prosecuted for the crimes under Article 277, Paragraph 1 and Article 335 of the Criminal Law. The court accepted the lawsuit, and Judge Huang Yan held a hearing yesterday morning. The defendants refused to appear in court. The accuser's lawyer stated that after the court summons was delivered to the defendants, it was said that they had joined Portuguese nationality and refused to accept it. The accuser and the defendants are all Chinese people and</p>
<p>Muslims</p>
<p>They have never joined other nationalities. In fact, after insulting the accuser, the defendants feared being condemned, so they specially contributed 2,000 yuan to join Portuguese nationality as a talisman to escape punishment. They should be strictly ordered to appear in court and severely punished according to law. The court ruled that the two defendants deliberately refused to appear in court and adjourned the hearing to August 20 for the defendants to appear in court for interrogation. If they still disobey, arrest warrants will be approved.</p>
<h3>Japanese Dancer at Far East Ballroom Arrested on Suspicion of Espionage, Japanese Consular Police Interrogating, Because She Supplied Japanese Military Secrets to British and Americans</h3>
<p>(Dazhong News Agency) The Japanese-language "Continental News" reported that a Japanese woman named Miss Lin, 20 years old, who works as a dancer at the Far East Ballroom in Yong'an Building, has been arrested by the Japanese consular police on suspicion of engaging in espionage and is currently under strict interrogation. It is said that Miss Lin came to Shanghai from Hankou in June and worked as a hostess at the Junhu Coffee Shop before changing to a dancer at the end of July. She obtained secret information from Japanese military personnel and supplied it to the British and American sides. It is heard that the interrogation has implicated many other dancers engaged in espionage activities. It is expected that this spy group will be wiped out soon.</p>
<h3>Peiping Resident Ma Ziren Scares and Blackmails His Sister-in-Law and Her Husband; Debate Concludes, Sentencing Scheduled</h3>
<p>Ma Ziren, a 30-year-old resident of Peiping and a graduate of Northeastern University, was entrusted by his mother-in-law the winter before last to take his sister-in-law, Yan Jing (also known as Yan Jingbo, a 20-year-old resident of Peiping), to Kunming for her studies. He carried with him 700 yuan for travel expenses. Unexpectedly, Ma had wicked intentions and did not escort Yan to Kunming. Instead, he brought her from Peiping</p>
<p>to Shanghai.</p>
<p>At the Huizhong Hotel on Sanma Road, he raped her and they began living together. When the money ran out, Ma ordered her to work as a dance hostess at the Dadong Ballroom. At that time, Yan met Chen Dingming (a 43-year-old native of Ningbo working as a senior clerk at the Laili Foreign Firm, residing at No. 25, Lane 42, Beidiao'ao Road). Friendship developed, and soon a relationship blossomed. Chen then instructed Yan to quit dancing, offering to cover her living expenses. Thus, Yan</p>
<p>took up residence at Chen's home.</p>
<p>Ma also followed, but secretly opposed the matter vehemently. He also insisted that Yan marry him. This came to Chen's attention, and he offered Yan 300 yuan to sever ties with Ma, and an additional 2,000 yuan as pocket money. However, Ma learned of this and spent his days indulging in pleasure and frequenting gambling dens. He would secretly demand money from Yan, ultimately depleting her 2,000 yuan savings. On the afternoon of the 25th of last month, at 8:30 PM, Ma once again</p>
<p>demanded money from Yan.</p>
<p>When Yan had no money to give, Ma went to the kitchen, grabbed a cleaver, and threatened Yan and Chen. Chen reported this to the police, who dispatched detective Qin Bichang to arrest Ma and bring him to the First Criminal Court of the Special No. 2 Court. After a brief interrogation by Judge Liao, as the police investigation was incomplete, the case was adjourned. These details were reported in previous news. Yesterday morning, the adjourned hearing took place. Police attorney Gu Shouxi, invoking Article 346 of the criminal law,</p>
<p>charged Ma with intimidation.</p>
<p>First, the plaintiffs Chen Dingming, Yan Jing, and Yan's mother recounted the events. When questioned, the defendant adamantly denied threatening them with a knife, but admitted to suffering from a nervous disorder. After reviewing the testimony, the court determined that the case was clear and ordered closing arguments. Sentencing was scheduled for the 17th. The defendant was remanded to custody.</p>
<h3>Chinese Flour Mills Exhausted Stock; Imminent Shutdown Rumored; Inland Flour Rushes to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The various Chinese flour mills within the Shanghai International Settlement have exhausted their raw material inventories. Orders for foreign wheat have not arrived, and domestic wheat is blockaded and unavailable. As a last resort, they resolved yesterday to shut down all operations within the week. The remaining flour, already in meager quantities, will also be sold off within days before ceasing wholesale operations. As flour is essential for northerners and the working class, and is a crucial aspect of the city's food supply, the reporter presents the following investigation:</p>
<p>Unified Control of New Wheat: Painful Maintenance</p>
<p>It is found that the Chinese flour mills within the Shanghai International Settlement, still include Fufeng New and Old Factories, Fuxin numbers seven and eight, and Huafeng Factory (large and small, six or seven in total). Operating at full capacity, they can produce seventy to eighty thousand bags daily. Besides supplying the local market, they can also sell surplus to merchants from north and south. However, since the new wheat came to the market this year, it has been under unified control, with transport to Shanghai forbidden. For two months, various attempts have been made, and discussions with different parties held, to seek relief, but the aim of procurement was never achieved. The flour mills have faced significant difficulties regarding their own property rights, trademarks, sales regions, employee livelihoods, and the city's food supply, painfully maintaining and sacrificing by selling at a loss for more than half a year.</p>
<p>Ordered Foreign Wheat: Still Not Arrived</p>
<p>Subsequently, mills have increased costs to absorb local wheat and order foreign wheat. However, even with the increased costs, local wheat is difficult to continuously deliver. Foreign wheat, due to a lack of ships, foreign exchange, and economic issues, only had orders for two ships from America and Australia. Furthermore, wheat orders are affected by the international situation, and have not arrived in Shanghai as scheduled. It is said that in the past, the flour industry only suffered from costs exceeding the selling price, sluggish sales, and resulting losses. Now, even the desire to painfully maintain operations is impossible.</p>
<p>No Immediate Impact on Food Supply</p>
<p>Furthermore, the northern sales regions have been entirely occupied by foreign flour, making it difficult for Shanghai flour to gain a foothold. The Nanyang area is frequently blockaded. The city and inland areas are also being overrun by foreign and domestically produced flour. Therefore, the future of the flour industry is already in a dire situation, not just because of the current raw material shortage forcing shutdowns. Fortunately, the supply of flour related to the city's food supply is not currently facing problems. Flour from Wuxi's Guangfeng and Jiufeng, Changzhou's Hengfeng, and the Yangtze River's Yicheng, Yangzi, and Tailai factories is arriving in Shanghai successively to meet demand. For foreign flour, Weida Foreign Firm's Pao Tai brand new flour has also been shipped. The prospect for the city's food supply does not seem to suffer from a shortage due to the Shanghai factories' shutdown.</p>
<h3>Economical Water Tank Coal Stove</h3>
<p>Dalai Factory recently invented the Sansheng water tank coal stove, which utilizes the wasted heat around the frying stove to heat the water tank pipes. On the left side, there is a large water tank which produces over two hundred gallons of hot water and boiled water daily. The frying stove can still be used to cook meals as usual, and the stove mouth can be sealed after cooking to save coal balls. However, the water in the tank gradually heats up, so it can be used at any time. It is not only economical but also convenient, making it an indispensable economical hot water system for homes, stores, schools, hospitals, and factories. It is said that the equipment can also be retrofitted onto existing coal stoves. A sales office is located at No. 61 Chengdu Road, Foch Road intersection, telephone 93566.</p>
<h3>Weather Report</h3>
<p>The Xujiahui Observatory's weather forecast at 4:30 PM yesterday: Shandong, this area, and the East Sea have trade wind air masses; sunny and hot weather; occasional cloud cover; southeasterly winds; a hurricane in the Pacific Ocean is moving northwest or west. The hurricane's center at 2 PM was within 15 degrees north latitude and 130 to 120 miles east longitude. Wind direction northwest or west, wind force unknown. Also, in the 24 hours before 3 PM yesterday, the local temperature was highest 96.1, lowest 75.2; the same day last year, highest 90.7, lowest 76.3.</p>
<h3>Two Rice Merchants Arrested in Avenue Joffre French Concession; One Ding Zhijian, One Xu Linshu; Shen Wenda Arrested Simultaneously, Later Released</h3>
<p>Around 6 AM yesterday morning, three plainclothes military police officers from the Japanese Military Police Corps, in two cars, went to the French Concession Police Station, requesting officers to accompany them on official business. The Police Station dispatched several detectives who went with them to No. 3, Lane 189 (i.e., Ruifuli), Avenue Joffre. First, they arrested two men inside. They then found the business card of Shen Wenda, the landlord of the house, who had previously served as the squad leader of the West Gate Branch of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau's Detective Team, in Shen's bedroom, and arrested Shen as well. They took them to the police station and then handed them over to the Japanese Military Police Corps. As Shen was unrelated, he was released. It is understood that the other two men, Ding Zhijian and Xu Linshu, are rice merchants who were staying at Shen's house because they had danced late at a certain ballroom the night before.</p>
<p>French Police Search San De Fang</p>
<p>Around 6 AM yesterday morning, the French Police Department dispatched a large contingent of Chinese and foreign detectives to search San De Fang on Rue Lupan, Rue Saussier. The residents in the lane were thoroughly inspected until about 8 AM. They found nothing.</p>
<p>Search of Jian Ye Li Yesterday Afternoon</p>
<p>Around 4 PM yesterday afternoon, the French Police ordered a large number of detectives to search house to house at Jian Ye Li, at the intersection of Fulili Road and Qiqi Road. The search lasted about an hour. It is said that the result was also negative.</p>
<p>Education News</p>
<h3>National Women's Normal College in Preparation; Site at Baisha, Seven Departments and One Specialty</h3>
<p>(Baisha News) Regarding the establishment of the National Women's Normal College, it has been learned that the site has been set at Baisha. Preparatory Director Xie Xunchu is currently in negotiations to purchase land and build. The internal organization will establish seven departments including Civic Education, Literature, History, Science, Chemistry, Music, and Home Economics, as well as a Physical Education specialty. It is expected to open the next semester, admitting only first-year freshmen. The preparatory expenses are 200,000 yuan, and the regular expenses are over 16,000 yuan per month for the first period. Department heads, professors, and lecturers are being selected separately. The future plan is to complete the organization of each grade level within five years and to attach a middle school and a public education center to implement teaching and promote social education.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Announces Middle School Curriculum Standards</h3>
<p>The revised middle school curriculum standards, formulated by the Ministry of Education by inviting experts, have been completed. The four types of standards for junior and senior middle school Chinese language and civics courses have been announced and implemented in the first ten days of this month.</p>
<h3>Central Vocational School of Arts and Crafts Silk Department Enrollment</h3>
<p>(Jiading News) The National Central Vocational School of Arts and Crafts has been operating since last spring, establishing five departments: Agricultural Product Manufacturing, Dyeing and Weaving, Papermaking, Leather, and Silk, each enrolling a class of freshmen. This spring, the school will continue to enroll students in each department for bridging class purposes. However, due to the need to expedite the department, the Silk department was unable to conduct enrollment at the same time as the other departments. Now that it is summer vacation, the department has moved to the main campus in Leshan and decided to enroll a class of freshmen. The quota is 50 students. The examinations will be held in Chongqing, Chengdu, and Leshan to select freshmen separately.</p>
<h3>Increase in Living Expenses for Primary and Secondary School Teachers in War Zones</h3>
<p>The living expenses of primary and secondary school teachers in war zones registered by the education departments of various provinces and the Third Service Corps are extremely low. With prices continuing to rise, it is difficult to maintain a living. The desire to increase their salaries is limited by the total amount of funding, making it extremely difficult. The Ministry of Education has found ways to raise funds, and starting in June, the living expenses of registered qualified primary and secondary school teachers in war zones will be increased by five yuan per month. Those not assigned work will not receive the increase.</p>
<h3>Increase in Meal Loans for Impoverished Students in War Zones</h3>
<p>Meal loans for impoverished students from war zones attending colleges and above, national middle schools, and Sun Yat-sen middle school classes were previously increased once due to high grain prices and the inadequacy of the original amount. Recently, as grain prices have not decreased, the situation in various regions has been considered and appropriately increased to ensure that students in all regions have enough to eat.</p>
<h3>Sending Personnel to Inspect Sixth Middle School</h3>
<p>To implement the plan for inspecting national middle schools, the Ministry of Education continues to send personnel to inspect various national middle schools. It is reported that Inspector Zhao Shilin will depart at the beginning of this month to inspect the National Sixth Middle School.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Increases Treatment for Normal School Students</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education recently instructed the education departments of various provinces and cities to find ways to improve the treatment of normal school students, and to specify previous treatment situations and submit concrete plans for review and approval.</p>
<h3>Awards for Impoverished Students from China YMCA and YWCA; Collection Begins Tomorrow</h3>

<h3>Financial Review (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Sheng Kai</p>
<p>The Seriousness of Shanghai's Prices</p>
<p>According to the Municipal Council's report, the general index of living costs for workers in Shanghai reached 449.18 in July, with a currency purchasing power of 22.26. In other words, the cost of living for Shanghai workers has increased by four and a half times compared to 1936, and the purchasing power of one yuan is now only a little over two jiao and two fen of 1936. Looking at the seven months of this year, the general index has been rising continuously from 325.44 in January, except for slight declines in March and April. The food category in the classification index also follows this trend; rent remained stable for the first six months, but suddenly rose by 43.36 in July; the clothing category rose straight to 403.85 in May, then repeatedly fell back to 326.79 in July; the fuel category decreased monthly from 474.61 in March to 444.62 in July; and the miscellaneous category steadily increased throughout.</p>
<p>From this analysis, we can derive two concepts: First, the rise in the general index is most deeply affected by food, and in July, the increase in rent further exacerbated the situation. Second, the decline in the clothing and fuel categories is far less than the rise in the food category index, so its impact on the general index is very slight. Due to these two concepts, Shanghai citizens have doubts about how much effort the concession authorities are putting into balancing prices.</p>
<p>In view of the seriousness of the Shanghai price problem, the concession authorities only established an evaluation committee in February of this year, and announced sixteen articles of regulations on the 19th of the same month. The Public Concession's Municipal Council also began to study countermeasures. On April 12th and 13th, the French Consulate and the Public Concession's Municipal Council issued announcements one after another, for the purpose of effectively stabilizing prices, requiring stores to mark the retail price per unit for designated foods (including rice, flour, oil, salt, tea, sugar, milk, meat, eggs, fish, vegetables, fruits), fuels (including coal, charcoal, kerosene), and soap. It seemed that further measures were being taken to stabilize prices. However, the two concession authorities were only able to publish average price lists for the fixed retail food, fuel, and soap products on a regular basis. They had no effective way to deal with the speculation and manipulation in wholesale prices. On the contrary, they only did some empty work, such as announcing on May 3rd a ban on taking advantage of exchange rate fluctuations to raise prices. The Public Concession authorities even sent letters to relevant commercial organizations on the 18th of the same month, urging them to lower prices. This did not have any effect on stabilizing prices. The food category, which the authorities put the greatest and only effort into stabilizing, not only did not decrease slightly like the clothing and fuel categories, but instead saw a long-term increase, from 337.97 in January to 485.80 in July. The citizens of Shanghai are definitely not deliberately criticizing the concession authorities' price stabilization work, but the results of their work are clearly being countered (such as the rise in the food category index), which makes the citizens of Shanghai, who are suffering from the heavy pressure of life, feel as if they have a bone stuck in their throat.</p>
<p>Some may say that Shanghai is surrounded by occupied areas, and it is very difficult to purchase goods that are easily available and very cheap due to various obstacles and exorbitant taxes, so prices have to rise, which is a real difficulty. However, the key to price stabilization is to dredge transportation, crack down on hoarding, prevent speculation, and prohibit manipulation. If these difficulties cannot be resolved, it is clear that the price stabilization work cannot be carried out to its full extent.</p>
<p>In short, the fact that Shanghai's price problem is becoming more serious day by day is definitely not a blessing for Shanghai's future. We are also well aware of the difficulties faced by the concession authorities in handling this, but this is a matter of common interest. We know that it is futile to say more, but fortunately, the concession authorities, with the welfare of the citizens as their premise, will surely take measures to alleviate the urgent crisis. (End)</p>
<h3>Food - More Foreign Rice Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>More foreign rice has arrived in Shanghai. The Taikoo Company's Jinan vessel arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong the day before yesterday (12th), carrying 934 bags of foreign rice. It docked at the company's own wharf in the French Concession and unloading was completed yesterday. The Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.'s Yisheng vessel arrived yesterday morning, carrying 1,064 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong. It docked at the Roosevelt Wharf for unloading. In addition, the Taikoo Company's Haikou vessel, carrying 1,724 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, arrived in Shanghai yesterday. It is said that this batch of foreign rice is scheduled to be shipped to Yantai on the same vessel today.</p>
<h3>Coal - Outsiders Hoarding Coal for Speculation is Like Spinning a Cocoon Around Themselves</h3>
<p>In recent weeks, the foreign coal market has been stimulated by the tightening of foreign exchange. Generally, cargo owners have taken this opportunity to raise the prices of both bituminous and anthracite coal by 20 to 30 yuan, whether openly or secretly. Outsiders are hoarding goods, and factory users, upon hearing this news, are vying to search for and absorb large quantities of coal, believing they can monopolize a rare commodity. This is all because in the spring of this year, due to the gradual increase in coal prices, many ordering merchants profited greatly. As a result, they became greedy and purchased large quantities, with imports exceeding normal levels. Summer is usually a slow selling season. Since various ports and the coastal areas of eastern Zhejiang have been blockaded, most factories have suspended work, and the occupied areas are controlled by a certain party, making it impossible to move fuel. Deliveries continue uninterrupted, and by autumn, the stocks in warehouses on both sides of the Huangpu River in this city will reach approximately 700,000 to 800,000 tons of bituminous and anthracite coal, which is sufficient to meet the needs of the autumn and winter seasons for half a year. Therefore, even with the expansion of the Anglo-French war, there is no fear of fuel shortage in this city. Although foreign exchange has tightened slightly on the cost side, who knows that due to the blockade of various routes, there is a surplus of ships and competition among peers, so freight rates have fallen without being lowered. Therefore, although coal merchants have increased the cost of goods, freight and other expenses have also been reduced a lot. "Losing at sunrise, gaining at sunset." After offsetting each other, the cost remains unchanged. Based on the current situation, there is no possibility of price increases. Therefore, outsiders using coal hoarding for speculation is like spinning a cocoon around themselves. (Pei Ben)</p>

<h3>Soap</h3>
<p>— Liu Tang</p>
<p>Long days of boredom, sitting quietly at home, I occasionally chat with my children about past events to pass the time. Bingzhong then asked me what the character "zao" in "feizao" (soap) means. I said: "Zao was originally written as 皂, 皂 is its common form. Zao means the color black. In ancient times, lowly officials and servants were called 'zao' and 'li,' and later, government soldiers were called 'zao li.' This is the origin. When officials ascended the court, they held staffs and stood in rank, and when they went out, they shouted to clear the way. They wore tall, pointed hats and straight-collared robes of a dark brown color. A close examination of the character 皂 reveals a servant standing upright, wearing a hat and holding a staff. It is said that the hats of the servants symbolized the crowns worn by the Yuan imperial family. The Ming Taizu destroyed the Yuan dynasty and used them as hats for servants. Therefore, this hat has a rich historical significance." Bingzhong then asked me, "Since zao means brownish-black, why is the color of soap not black but yellow?" I said, "The zao of the past was black, but the zao of today is yellow. The term 'feizao' (soap) existed in China, but the soap used today is not the original Chinese soap, but soap introduced from foreign countries." In ancient China, the things used for washing were: (1) soap pods, (2) alkali, and (3) ash lye. Soap pods are the name of a tree, which can grow to a height of several zhang. It blooms yellow-green flowers in the summer, and after the flowers, it bears pods, which are flat like broad bean pods but larger, and can be seven or eight cun long. From a distance, they look like knives in scabbards, and their color is black, so they are called soap pods, also known as soap horns. Boiling the pods in water can be used for washing clothes. Choose the pods that are long, plump, fatty, and sticky, mash them into a paste, and mold them into squares. That is called 'feizao' (soap). Add fragrance, and it is called 'xiangzao' (perfumed soap). The name 'feizao' originated from this. In the past, many people in the Suzhou and Shanghai area made this kind of soap. Its color was black, and the fragrance varied, such as osmanthus. When I was young, I often saw my late father like to use it. Although there were perfumed soaps such as Maosheng at that time, people still habitually used the locally made osmanthus soap. However, the quality was rough and painful to the skin, so when foreign soap was imported, the local soap gradually lost its use. (Currently, the Jinlixu powder shop still sells soap pod soap.)"</p>
<p>Alkali is mostly transported from the north. There are two kinds, one is transparent and the other is opaque. It is produced in places such as Baotou, which are called saline-alkali lands. In the past, it was transported south from Tianjin, transferred to Yingkou, and then barged by sand boats. Poor families used grass and wood ash and placed it in a bamboo basket, lined with thatch, filled with ash, and watered it daily to filter it. The water that dripped down contained alkali, that is, calcium carbonate, for washing.</p>
<p>When did foreign soap start to enter China? This is difficult to determine. Dream of the Red Chamber is the book that best reflects the life of a group of nobles during the Kangxi and Yongzheng reigns. The only mention of soap in Dream of the Red Chamber is in the twenty-first chapter, when Xiangyun washed her face, Bao Yu took the opportunity to wash his face in the leftover water, and Zijuan handed him perfumed soap. Bao Yu said, "There is enough in this basin, no need to rub." It is not known whether the perfumed soap used here was a foreign product or a local product. But judging from the era, the local product was more likely. First, the author of Dream of the Red Chamber often highlighted foreign objects. Second, the import of foreign goods only became prevalent after the reigns of Qianlong, Jiaqing, and Daoguang. Third, judging from the word "rub," it must have been the old soap. The perfumed soap made from soap pods was rough and hard, not as soft and smooth as modern perfumed soap, so it was necessary to "rub" hard when washing. In addition, women used to moisturize their skin with either pancreas, taken from pig organs and soaked in wine, which could remove chapped skin and make the skin smooth, or honey, which was used for smearing. When foreign honey (glycerin) was imported, this method was naturally eliminated. Foreign honey is glycerin, and glycerin is a by-product of soap, so they are intrinsically linked.</p>
<p>Since I could not find out when soap first entered China, I thought of visiting Mr. Zhu Zhiyao. Mr. Zhiyao is already seventy-eight years old and grew up in Shanghai. He devoted himself to the industry at an early age, and his energetic spirit has not diminished. Mr. Zhiyao said that when he was over ten years old, people still used the old method for washing clothes, and there was no soap like the one used today. Only foreign perfumed soap existed, but it was not yet popular. According to his recollection, it seemed that the manager of a certain German foreign firm said to his Chinese manager: "I am thinking of traveling abroad with you to investigate which goods are most suitable for sale in China." When the Chinese manager returned, he told the foreign manager that there were two goods that were the cheapest and most widely used: one was soap for washing clothes, and the other was thread for sewing clothes. The foreign manager followed his advice and achieved great sales. However, at that time, Chinese people also imitated the manufacture of soap, but due to simple equipment and small scale, the products were of very poor quality, yellow in color and with a lot of moisture. When fresh, they were very soft and moist, making them unsuitable for scrubbing. They were commonly called "yellow pumpkin soap." After overnight, they became extremely hard and contained a lot of alkali, which easily damaged clothes. However, due to the lack of good soap, people still happily used it. Since the Xiangmao and Guben soaps were launched one after another (in addition, there were also soaps such as Beiji, which were of pure quality and convenient for users), the Guben factory was originally run by a German merchant, who returned to his country during World War I, and was then invested in and managed by Wuzhou, and it still stands as a giant in the Chinese soap manufacturing industry.</p>
<p>Yesterday was August 13th, and most businesses were closed, so I wrote this to fill the void in commerce and finance. I originally had a work called "Economic Miscellany," in which I wanted to organize and study the origins of people's livelihood economics and everyday goods. When I have the opportunity, I will meet with readers again.</p>

<h3>Scenery of Xuanwu Lake</h3>
<p>Outside the Taiping Gate of Jinling, there is Xuanwu Lake, which has a circumference of thirty li. All around it are planted water chestnuts and lotus. Three sides are inaccessible to people. There are fishing households on five isles who make fishing their livelihood for generations. A separate official is appointed to manage the fishing tax, and the lotus seeds produced are also managed and sold by them, yielding substantial profits. After the Taiping Rebellion was put down, when Zeng Wenzheng Gong was the Governor-General of Liangjiang, there were famine refugees from Jiangbei coming to Ning. He imitated the method of providing relief through labor, ordering them to build a dike, and constructing several bridges in the middle to allow water to flow. The dike is several li long and incomparably strong. Commentators say that it can be compared to the Su and Bai dikes of West Lake, shining in succession. At the end of the dike is the Lake God Temple, which was originally there and rebuilt. Next to the temple, there is a three-room building, with a small portrait of Zeng Wenzheng Gong hanging in the middle. Mr. Xue Weinong of Taicang wrote a couplet for the building: "In human society, a prime minister; in heaven, a deity. Indeed, returning to the true nature of Penglai, one can imagine that Yuanjiao and Fanghu have such water. A small troop once came, leaving behind a great name that will never fade. Leaving behind the loving memory of the lake and mountains, comparable to Xie An and Wang Dao, each possessing a thousand autumns." Climbing the building and looking far away, one can only see green clouds stretching for ten thousand acres, encircling without end, and the soaring green mountains, extending as far as the eye can see, are especially worthy of gazing upon. Imagining the scenes of flower viewing, there must be countless things to behold. Reciting Mr. Yuan Jianzhai's line, "Imagining the heart for flowers is deeper than seeing the flowers," one cannot help but sigh for a long time. On the side of the temple gate, there is a well, named Bronze Hook. According to the monks in charge, the well was dug more than two zhang deep, and a bronze hook was found, and the spring water gushed out. The taste is clear and cold, comparable to the Yongning Spring of Yuhuatai. Trying it, it is not mistaken. It is a pity that the bronze hook was presented to the county office and could not be seen, which is regrettable!</p>

<h3>Exploration of Health Care Issues</h3>
<p>— Cao Jian</p>
<p>Everyone knows that cities, due to their large population and polluted air, are also the places where various diseases are most rampant and prevalent. Since the war, the number of people coming to Shanghai from various places has increased day by day. For economic reasons, it doesn't seem to matter if several families live in a small house. If you are unlucky enough to have someone in your family get sick, it will be even worse. Sometimes the illness is contagious, and then you have to infect one by one. For the poor, it is not easy to see a doctor. They can't even get enough to eat, so how can they have money to see a doctor? Therefore, many poor people die of illness, either because of incompetent doctors or because they leave it to fate and pray for the arrival of death. This is such a tragic thing! I want to talk about social health care work here, nothing more than for the health of the public, and to hope to reduce the number of poor people who die unnatural deaths. I hope that those who are interested can pay attention to it.</p>
<p>I believe that the issue of social health care is not a simple matter, nor is it a personal matter, but a matter for the public. Social health care work is multifaceted, requiring the enthusiastic cooperation of everyone, as well as self-sacrificing people to come out and advocate and implement it, and many people to widely publicize it, so that everyone understands the true meaning of health care work. Everyone contributing a little more effort will also reap more rewards. The following points are my personal thoughts on social health care work, but they still need to be supplemented, researched, and explored by experts and other people.</p>
<h3>Compliance with Public Health</h3>
<p>Cities have large populations, and if everyone does not pay attention to public health, then diseases will be even more rampant. There are still many people who do not understand the true meaning of public health and still spit and urinate everywhere. We must all know that spitting on the ground may not seem to matter much, but if there are bacteria in the sputum, it is easy to spread to others. For the sake of our own and others' health, we should all change our bad habits.</p>
<h3>Establishment of Health Care Associations</h3>
<p>The main purpose of establishing health care associations is to give the general public the opportunity to receive diagnosis and treatment before their illnesses become serious. Many people neglect their problems when they first start, and only go to the doctor when they are terminally ill. How can they be cured then? Our current society needs some famous doctors to come out and establish health care associations so that everyone has the opportunity to get medical treatment. The Luo Luo Medical Clinic in Los Angeles, USA, is a famous health care association with thriving business. People who join the Luo Luo Medical Clinic only need to pay a certain fee each year to get famous doctors to diagnose and treat their diseases, and can also have regular physical health checkups to understand their physical condition. If everyone can go to the doctor when their problems are not serious, then the doctor will not have to make much effort to cure their problems, and the patients themselves can avoid suffering from serious illnesses.</p>
<h3>Doctors Must Have a Heart to Help the World</h3>
<p>Many poor people suffer from diseases and want to see a doctor, but they cannot afford it because the consultation fees are too expensive. Therefore, I hope that doctors must have a heart to help the world, and spend some time to treat the poor, either by providing free treatment or only charging for medicine.</p>
<h3>Widely Conduct Health Education Work</h3>
<p>There are many things that can be done in health education work, such as publishing regular health publications, broadcasting common health knowledge, investigating the health status of the poor, and holding health education weeks.</p>
<p>The above points are what I personally feel are the most needed social health care work, but I know that social health care work is certainly not that simple. I sincerely hope to elicit discussions and opinions from experts.</p>
<h3>Waste Utilization</h3>
<p>— Qing Hui</p>
<p>In the recruitment column, a large company is seeking two mute secretaries. I speculate that their intentions are no more than the following three points: First, they can strictly keep secrets; second, they can scold at will without protest; and third, the environment is dangerous, and free speech may lead to personal disaster. In addition to this, there are two other disabled people who can be used: one is a lame accountant, because the lame person is not easy to run around, and can guard the treasury to the death. The other is a blind servant, because he cannot recognize the true faces of the master's friends. However, in this time of unemployment panic, there may be people who are forced to pretend to be mute, blind, or lame. Recruiters must be cautious.</p>
<h3>Save the Poor Children Who Are Out of School – A Letter from a Teacher at a Summer Neighborhood Children's Voluntary School –</h3>
<p>— Yu Bi</p>
<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>We are a group of young middle school students. In order to serve the society and help out-of-school children in general, we have opened a voluntary school during the summer vacation. Tuition is free, and books are also provided by us.</p>
<p>In the short period of nearly one and a half months of teaching, we have found that among many poor children, there are many who are intelligent and have good grades. So the problem arises, if our voluntary school ends, won't these intelligent and excellent poor students have to drop out of school again? This makes us feel very unbearable, but we don't have the power to provide them with tuition fees. So I hope that the editor can publish this letter so that people from the society and charitable organizations can give us a hand to help these poor children continue their studies. We would be very grateful for that. I wish you</p>
<p>All the best! Teacher of the Shanghai YMCA Middle School Neighborhood Children's Voluntary School</p>
<p>If there are charitable people or organizations that can help us, please write directly to 599 Sichuan Road, and we will send someone to contact you. The China United Amusement Association has always spared no effort in promoting welfare for its members. Recently, a high-end barber shop has been added, costing one yuan for four times and shaving the face costing 9 jiao 6 for four times. Coupons are printed and sold by the association's consumer cooperative. For each haircut or shave, one coupon is paid, and no additional costs are required. According to those who have tried it, "life" is also done well, so many people have been going to the barber shop to get "economic haircuts" recently.</p>

<h3>The Final Destination of the Dance Queen</h3>
<p>— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter 5 Bad News</p>
<p>The old man stared at him fiercely and asked, "What are you doing?"</p>
<p>The young man said, "I want to find that Zhao person."</p>
<p>"No, get out of here!"</p>
<p>"He was here yesterday."</p>
<p>"I came here today. You're dreaming!"</p>
<p>Before the sound of "dreaming" had disappeared, the door slammed shut again. Yu Gantang seemed very annoyed. The right side of his clothes suddenly bulged, obviously a gun barrel. This guy is really too reckless. He knocked on the wrong person's room. Did he even want to shoot? Fortunately, at this time, a waiter in a white gown walked over from the east end. Seeing Yu Gantang about to raise his hand to knock on the door again, he rushed over to stop him. "Sir, who are you looking for?" "That Zhao person—uh, that Qian person." "You're mistaken. The person inside is named Jin." "He was here yesterday." "Yes, Mr. Qian moved out last night. You can't knock on people's doors like this."</p>
<p>I couldn't see the number of this waiter clearly, but it wasn't the 71 just now. His nimble words actually prevented Yu Gantang from acting out.</p>
<p>He glared at the waiter and asked, "Where did he move to?"</p>
<p>The experienced waiter also bravely returned his glare and replied coldly, "Who knows?" He then went back to the east end on his own.</p>
<p>At this time, I was only concerned with the tense situation in front of me, but I forgot about my own cover. A middle-aged man in a suit was walking over from behind me. I glanced at the corner of my eye, thinking it was Hawthorne. It wasn't. That man was also wearing a dark suit, and a black felt hat was pressed low, and the gaze under the brim was clearly fixed on me. I couldn't help but feel a little embarrassed. In fact, my posture was indeed easy to arouse suspicion. I simply stooped down, pulled out the knot of my shoelaces, and slowly retied it. This posture actually got me through two difficult situations. The middle-aged man and Yu Gantang both brushed past me in front of me. Except for the middle-aged man turning his head to look at me again, Yu Gantang walked straight to the west exit without looking sideways. When I stood up straight again, Yu Gantang's back was already gone. (75)</p>
<h3>The Automatic Sacrifice of Christ (II)</h3>
<p>Last time we mentioned that the automatic sacrifice of Christ teaches us what love is, what true friendship is, but what else? (III) It should teach us what "real" sacrifice is: The sacrifices that ordinary people shout about, shaking the heavens, are mostly not sacrifices at all. Some people who are used to swindling others think that defrauding others of a little less money is a sacrifice. There are also some ambitious people who think they are making a sacrifice by slightly reducing the level of their desires. In reality, strictly speaking, whether it is sacrificing time, energy, money, or anything else, as long as you harbor some hope, it is not a sacrifice. A big clearance sale in a store cannot be considered a sacrifice; only giving away for free can be considered a sacrifice. Jesus' sacrifice was without any return. He willingly gave his life so that the people of the world could be saved. (IV) It teaches us how the teachings can be completed: Jesus said, "Whoever wants to be first must be your slave, just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many." (Matthew 20:27) The meaning of "ransom for many" is that one person dies in place of many. This spirit is admired by believers and non-believers alike. Jesus was crucified, and all who believed in him and followed in his footsteps were saved. Moreover, the scope of this salvation is not limited by time, space, or race; the sins of mankind throughout the ages and in all nations are forgiven entirely through the death of Jesus.</p>
<p>There was once a poor widow who, through her earnings as a servant, painstakingly raised her orphaned child until he graduated from university. On the day her son graduated from university, she went to attend the graduation ceremony, hoping that her son would give her some comfort. Who knew that her son, because he already had the daughter of a wealthy man as his fiancée, did not want this lady to know that he had such a mother who worked as a servant. So, he buried his conscience and pointed at his birth mother, saying to others, "This is a longtime maid in my house. I only sucked on her milk a few times when I was little, and it's not a big deal." This university student, because he was afraid of losing his fiancée, actually had the heart to disown his birth mother. He was truly ungrateful and extremely shameful! Jesus is a friend who gave his life for us. How can we not recognize him as the Savior and only think of this as a tragic scene in history? Readers who wish to know more details, please send a letter to the Shanghai Aiwenyi Road No. 351 Literary Evangelism Society, and you will receive a detailed reply.</p>

<h3>A Glimpse of Guilin's Entertainment Industry</h3>
<p>— Xiao Qi</p>
<p>Guilin is now one of the six major cities in China, and it is full of vigor. No matter what kind of undertaking, it is constantly growing with a lively posture; the entertainment aspect is naturally no exception.</p>
<p>Guilin currently has nine theaters, with Peking opera, Cantonese opera, spoken drama, and Guilin opera, everything is available and complete. Guilin opera is a kind of local opera popular in the lower and middle classes of Guilin society, somewhere between Peking opera and Xiang opera. Although the three belong to the same origin, they have developed independently for a long time and have their own indelible local characteristics, carrying a unique color. Its tune does not seem as tactful and varied as Peking opera, and sometimes it is not as sonorous and crisp as Peking opera, but its simple style is especially suited to the tastes of the local people. Especially the words are relatively easy to understand, truly as clear as daylight, even old women can understand. Its performance is slower, and sometimes not as lively as Peking opera; but the acting is very delicate and comfortable, extremely moving.</p>
<p>The "Guangxi Drama Improvement Association" is organized by dozens of people from the Party, government, military, education, and art circles who are enthusiastic about cultural movements and have similar interests. The late Dr. Ma Junwu, president of Guangxi University, served as the president, and Mr. Bai Pengfei served as the vice president. They began to improve Guilin opera. Later, the playwright Ouyang Yuqian came to Guilin and organized a sound troupe. In the summer of last year, they began rehearsing the famous play "Liang Hongyu," and later successively rehearsed several famous works such as "The Peach Blossom Fan," "Mulan Joins the Army," "Searching the Temple and Reversing Justice," and "Victory Year," and the results were very good. As for the performance techniques, dance, set design, lighting, and costumes, they are all extremely advanced. For example, the expressive play "Human Face Peach Blossoms" has gained considerable praise. Therefore, the innovation and progress of Guilin opera are all due to the advocacy and reform of Dr. Ma Junwu and the guidance of Mr. Ouyang Yuqian. In addition, there are also modernized entertainments that have arisen with the times, such as swimming pools. In the Zizhou area of the Lijiang River in the eastern suburbs of Guilin, the river water is now used to develop swimming pools. The river water is clear, and the aquatic plants and pebbles at the bottom of the river are clearly visible. Compared with the seaside bays in Hong Kong and the Gaoqiao swimming pool in Shanghai, although the size is different and the equipment is simpler, the clear water is like oil, and the overlapping mountains on both sides are reflected in the water, lush and verdant, the scenery is far better than Hong Kong and Shanghai. Therefore, general modern men and women often come here in droves to enjoy their swimming addiction; or a leaf of a boat, let go in the middle of the river, let it go, sing loudly, there is a tendency to be happy and forget to return.</p>
<h3>Chen Yunshang's Family Life</h3>
<p>— Yan Ciping</p>
<p>There is a delicate study room to find spiritual food; there is a spacious platform to enjoy family happiness. There is a newly built Western-style house on Julai Road. There is often a beautiful car driving in and out. You can often see a lively and charming girl, using a brisk, almost dance-like pace, stepping onto or out of that car. She is the girl that the majority of movie fans care about—silver screen star Miss Chen Yunshang.</p>
<p>The three floors have a total of three large rooms, which are very comfortably assigned to three use rooms, one as a bedroom, one as a study room, and one as a rest room and reception room. The arrangement is exquisite and elegant. Her study room has many bookshelves and cabinets, filled with literary books, movie publications, and many other books that can increase knowledge. The girl often uses her soft fingers to caress them affectionately, like a loving mother caressing her own child.</p>
<p>Every day she has to sit there for several hours, reading the daily newspaper, reading movie publications, and paying more attention to the criticisms written about herself on them. She carefully cuts out the words and photos about her one by one and pastes them in a notebook, becoming a very interesting and valuable scrapbook. She also studies books about film expression or art. Although her expression is already top-notch, and her art is already on the road to success, she is still not satisfied and is still diligently pursuing all knowledge.</p>
<p>She not only spends time reading books, but also has to play the piano and sing. Every day at 2 pm, she has to study English, except when she is very busy and cannot spare the time, she never interrupts. Chen Yunshang is a Guangdong girl, but she can speak fluent and crisp Mandarin. Before she came to Shanghai, her Mandarin was not very pure, but after studying for a few months, she improved rapidly, which even made her Mandarin teacher He Jianfei admire. She is a pure 20th-century modern girl. In terms of private life, she will not go with the flow and be as romantic as ordinary female stars. She is a filial daughter and a good sister. When the situation in Hong Kong was tense, Chen Yunshang was worried about her father and sister living there, so she asked them to come to Shanghai. Adding two more people out of thin air meant that one floor of the house was not enough to live in. Yunshang could not bear to see her family crowded together uncomfortably, so she rented the four-story building in the public apartment and provided it for them to live in. The four-story building was more spacious than the three-story building. There were also two large rooms, and there was also a large platform. The cool summer breeze often blew from the platform. The platform was covered with canvas, which was very delicate, with the flavor of a night garden. Every night when Yunshang had time, she would sit on that platform with her family and enjoy family happiness.</p>
<h3>Li Shengzao's Entourage Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Wei Wo</p>
<p>Sheng (old male role) actor Li Shengzao, at the invitation of the Golden Grand Theater, took the Shuntian Wheel from Tianjin to Shanghai yesterday and arrived at the port at 10 am. In addition to supporting actors Tong Zhiling, Gao Shenglin, Jiang Shiyu, Sun Shengwu, and Li Shilin, Li's father-in-law Gao Qingkui also came along. According to Gao Qingkui, he was a popular actor ten years ago, famous throughout the north and south of the Yangtze River. Six years ago, he once cooperated with Kunling Zhang Guoyun to perform in the Golden Grand Theater. After the term expired, he returned north, and due to quitting smoking, his voice became ill. He couldn't utter a single word, so he couldn't re-present his great skills, and the audience couldn't help but regret it. This time, the Golden Grand Theater firmly invited Gao Ling to Shanghai to rehearse Gao-style masterpieces such as "Gifting a Silk Robe" and "Crying in the Qin Court" for his son-in-law, so he resolutely went south. The reporter met Gao Ling at the Cangzhou Hotel yesterday. Not only was he older than before, but he had also become a dumb voice, which made people feel unable to overcome the feeling of the past and present. According to Gao Ling, his son-in-law Shengzao has recently had an excellent voice, very similar to the heyday of Qingkui. Qingkui's early famous masterpieces have all been taught to Shengzao, so Shengzao has become Qingkui's successor. Gao Ling said with infinite emotion, showing a happy look, and expected that his son-in-law's art must be extraordinary. In addition, there is one more thing worth mentioning, that is, the Kunling Tong Zhiling, who came with Shengzao this time, has both beauty and talent, and has always been a rare talent among the rising Kun Dan. It is expected that Zhiling's performance this time will definitely become popular in Chun Shen (Shanghai), not letting Wu Suqiu monopolize the beauty in the past.</p>

<h3>Thirty Years in Film</h3>
<p>— Wen Qin</p>
<p>Wallace Beery has devoted himself to the film industry for thirty years. In terms of qualifications, among all the stars in Hollywood today, there is only one Lionel Barrymore who can match him. However, his appeal is not absolutely due to his "old" age, and precisely because of his age, we can draw a conclusion: if he does not have superior acting skills—with enough power to attract the audience, then he would have been eliminated in the competitive process of this long thirty years. This great artist was born in Kansas City as the youngest of three sons of a police officer named Noppilei; he was diligent and did not want to study, and liked to be friends with railroad workers. Before entering the film industry, he had worked as a worker in a screw factory and as a lion tamer in a circus.</p>
<p>In June 1910, Wallace began to devote himself to the screen. At first, he specialized in comedy, but at that time, it was the heyday of Keystone, and he was at a loss. So, after starring in Behind The Door and gaining success, he switched to playing knight-like and humorous roles; he successively played in several silent films such as The Four Horsemen, The Three Musketeers, Robin Hood, and Richard the Lionheart. Later, due to environmental factors, he once again switched to comedy.</p>
<p>Transitioning to the sound era, Wallace Beery played two works that were then regarded as transcendent: The Big House and The Champ. And his rough style was also greatly praised. Under the pursuit of various companies, he was finally extended to MGM. Up to now, I don’t know how many films he has starred in, and each film has a surprising (box office appeal, which is really rare.</p>
