<p>社評</p>
<h3>美國如何及時而動</h3>
<p>美日商約的時效，祇餘三日；盛傳美日之間，在東京有若斷若續的談話，日本駐美大使尤多方鑽營，使人不敢斷言於三日內絕對無所成就；但觀察大勢，不妨預測美日乃主遠東的一大轉捩點即在目前。原來此事在日本是咎由自取，在美國是主動而必成竹在胸；日本侵略政策將大受打擊，却是目食其報；美國爲本身正當利權的自衛行動，却有裨於中國的抗戰。因果若斯，宜無意外幻變；但經過了幾月　的醖釀，到了商約行將滿期的前夕，美國政府議會，對於禁止車火原料，尙未有斷然的決定；推原其故，大抵由於美國養成輿論有其必不可少的時間，目前在時間的過程之中。在日本力面，希望在二月二十六日商約滿期後，能與美國成立臨時協定，使最惠國待遇條款，能延長若干時；而在美國方面，則尙有一部分人希望日本能切實提出保證，尊重美國在華權益，以爲成立臨時辦法的先決條件。其實美國對日本的希望終屬虛願。日本自侵略中因以來，因日本軍事行動而造成損害美國在華權益的案件，據美國國務卿赫爾公佈，達六百件之多。舉其大者言之，如美國砲艦潘納號之在長江中被炸沉，中航機之在華南被擊毀；他如美國產業的被日機炸毀，自一九三七年八月起，至一九三九年九月止，有一百五十餘起之多，內中美國在華所設立的敎會，醫院，及敎育機關居多數，計敎會及學校炸毀達三十六所，傷美籍人民二十五人，死二十四人。這是美國所受損失的一部分，至今皆在懸案之列，絕未解決。其間雖經過美國的多次抗議，然而日本當局始終漠　，大多空言搪塞，甚且置之不理。不但如此，懸案已多，而損害美國權益的行動，侮辱美僑的事件，仍復層出不窮。日本前外相野村，自命爲美國友人，爲了續訂商約，不吝口角春風，似乎不復敢漠視；然在日本當局控制下的輿論，却又一再對美咆哮挑戰；誰不能覷破了他們的色厲內荏？誰不能證實了他們的毫無誠意？尤如華北日軍：在天津方面平時壓迫美僑，近頃變本加厲；其駐防日軍司令本間在美國駐華大使詹森赴北方之時。公開對美國示威，謂：「如華盛頓續訂新商約，而對日本表示新友誼姿態，則日人當竭力對美人的權益與事業，予以便利之處，但如無這好意的姿態，則兩國關係，將更趨惡化，而以廢約爲起點。」本間所謂「惡化」，雖沒有說明其內容，但至少可以知道他準備着對於美國在華的商人，更多留難。現在野村對美一無成就，下台而去；繼起的有田，雖日蕭規曹隨，一仍前內閣的外交方針；然有田又想拉攏英國，以便一面對美，一面制華；如此詭謀却因蛛絲馬跡而成爲公開的秘密了。但看日本報紙，所謂「如東亞新秩序與對美新約，吾人倘若不得而兼有之，則吾人不得不放棄後者。」這裏所謂東亞新秩序，就是把中國降爲附庸，由日本獨佔，而把第三國權益排斥於中國之外，關閉中國門戶的另一名辭。證之隔昨在香港方面所揭布的所謂妥協條件：日本在揚子江下游取得經濟優勢，及在華南某數島嶼居最高地位，在海關貿易稅源航空郵政電話及一般測重上另訂協定，予日本以特殊利益及利便（詳見昨報載香港路透電）；這是所謂「束亞新秩序」的具體說明，誠哉制華，然何嘗不足將美國的政策與主張以及條約上之權利義務，一舉而摧毀之！美國人士是有「嚴判是非的勇氣的」，美國政治家也是反對黷武主義最力的；當然不至於因爲維持買賣，因爲貪得「血錢」，置是非於不辨，予黷武以物資；然則三日之後，採取有效的，對於和平有建設性的行動，使侵略者受到打擊而使被侵略者受到實惠，正是美國朝野所應及時而動，義不容辭吧！</p>

<p>大使語人並無目的</p>

<p>外交界傳視察意義</p>
<p>惟　本埠外交界稱、大使此行、確為巡視何故不開放至漢口為止、據復稱大使兼為研究自揚子江被日方藉口軍事需要、加以封鎖後、對第三國之利益、遭擯奪無餘情形、亦有所注意、大使於　漢返抵此間、將　行所得、負責代表各國政府、加以決定一切、</p>
<p>潯蕪各埠亦須調查</p>
<p>據另一報告、大使更將研究與考慮關於日方允許第三國際在揚子江之通航問題、大使不僅於此、日將沿揚子江重要口岸、如蕪湖·九江·一帶美僑商務利益情形、大使等亦將作精密之調查、此亦主要原因之一、期以一星期之行程、抵達漢口、</p>
<p>留漢三日原艦歸滬</p>
<p>在漢將有三日之停留、會晤漢口美總領、聽取報告、與美僑主要商人、稍作接觸後、定二月二日仍乘原艦呂宋號南來、屆時改由瓜姆號保護來滬、可望於二月六日到達此間、</p>
<p>下月赴港轉飛重慶</p>
<p>留滬小住、然後偕同拉芳秘書　槕赴港飛渝、至於同來之瓜姆號、以沃湖號已在漢口駐防、故暫泊滬濱十一號海軍浮筒、以代沃湖號離滬之缺、際茲美日商約行將於本月二十六日廢止之時、故一般人對大使等一行赴漢、均予重視、</p>

<p>使用指定之第一號普通貨物碼頭兩處、與第四號危險貨物碼頭一處、同期中則有一百五十二艘船隻被迫在不適用之碼頭寄椗、載卸貨客、該碼頭在一九三八年日軍侵佔青島之前、從未加以使用、又同期中</p>
<p>駛入青島港之日船、除二艘外、其餘均立即在外洋輪船所用之四碼頭寄椗、其指定由外國輪船停泊之兩碼頭、亦逐漸供日船使用、直至九月份、迄無外輪應用矣、日當局輒藉</p>
<p>種種壟斷予日船以優先權、並種用許可制、統制土貨出口中、結果、外船僅能載運日船所不欲或不適於載運之貨物、</p>

<h3>糧食小麥已抬至十九元　回籠粉又創新高價　廠粉街銷限制更嚴</h3>
<p>小麥　昨小麥市價又創最新高峰、按近日內地來源、因被某方扣住、到貨日少、貨方居奇之心亦堅、加之投機者心理欲將小麥抬至二十元、昨日小麥由出口帮成交五六車、價達十九元五角之高峯、比前在漲元外、廠家吃盤、亦已到達十九元之價、計開蘇常麥十九元、南京鎭江麥十八元九角半至八角四分、太倉麥十八元七角、由福新廠辦去六百包、阜豐廠辦去一千包、尙有日廠收進一千餘包、售價亦須十九元、擯持多日之麥市、結果則實現驚人之在漲、洋麥昨成交七千噸、合二十五元、</p>
<p>麵粉　昨現粉市况、查二號粉本街批價、爲維持民食起見、尙不增加、惟限制供應、更爲嚴厲、客盤擯不開售、業已多日、一經關住、致一般需要者祗有回籠棧單貨可取、雖市價一再提高、亦不得飲鴆止渴、故昨日回籠貨又創新高價、綠砲車牌竟漲達十一元七角半、兵船牌去路較遜價仍爲十二元四角半、惟此係小票棧單、其整額者亦與砲車售價相去不遠也、在麥價暴騰之下、各廠更以居奇、誠亦平民副糧食之大患也、</p>
<h3>平糶開始　米銷遜色</h3>
<p>粳米內地來源、依然寥落、所由虹口轉出者仍祇靑角帮薄稻五百餘包、南港早晚稻二三百包、無如人心平庸、且作客心理、亦鑒於市面恐起變化、均各趦趄不前、而手中一般有貨者、有利可圖、反都趁機回出、以致銷塲旣淡、回籠貨到處皆是、故市價疲落、如新火紋米立貶三四角、自初開三十八元、至後僅售三十七元六角、餘外陳西貢及東京砶尖以脚地素屬堅固、去路較廣、尙守原盤、厚薄粳以日來到貨不繼、售意殊堅、且爲時令銷品、本鄕店胃納意殊旺、市面獨升半元左右、若蘇同帮之黎盛粳悉開四十元外、靑泗特薄亦開四十元、中市貨爲卅九元半、南港早晚稻三十九元、决至三十八元半、白元進出相埒、無所變化、近午形勢、因略受洋米影響、銷塲突又回呆、所以收市現象、已覺遜色、不若中早兩市之緊俏矣、</p>
<p>洋米昨日因匯水見縮、定價劃高、西貢一二號本難通劃、而碎米定價亦昂四五角、未克繼續成交、惟現洋米雖經貨方喊高、然以舖作納胃均淡、行囤亦復觀望、且在平糶開始之際、統市交易不足二千包、價祇微砌二三角、西貢一號三十九元三角、安南粳三十九元半、中次照別、</p>
<p>洋米昨又運到、係怡和洋行德生輪、自海防運來三千包、於香港裝來一萬二千六百包、共計一萬五千六百包、該輪昨晨進口、停靠羅斯福碼頭起卸、（砠）</p>
<h3>金融金市重振</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、隨匯市之轉軟而得重見回漲、惟初開依然萎靡、爲四千零三十元開盤、較上週末撳小十一元、原因外匯仍鬆、繼以金號吐塞再低二元、嗣因匯市轉定、證券帮首先撈進、同時其錢業吃胃甚佳、力代本港兩帮吸購、故市勢遂見回平、一度盤旋於四千零四十元左右、不意午刻外匯忽報緊軟、遂使買戶精神一振、證券帮與某銀號紛來拖人、價乃再高千餘元、將近收盤時、某金號復來吐售、遂回降達四千零五十一元收盤、午後初以匯市繼續微緊、開市遂抬至四千零五十九元高價、奈證券帮獲利復出、及金號再賣、故結果與午收相同、仍爲四千零五十一元、較上週六軋漲十元、至全天交易尙暢、共的一千二三百兩、銀樓飾余呆定、海關金等仍平、</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）初開因匯市鬆硬、人氣散漫、錢兌業與散戶均有賣胃、故開市即被壓小十一元、某銀號出同業二十兩、爲四千零三十元、少頃金號亦賣、再小二元、金號售予錢兌業十兩、爲四千零二十八元、此後外匯報定、某證券帮頓乘賤撈入、且錢兌業某號亦忽代客帮搜進、不久即回起十二元、某證券帮進金號三十兩、爲四千零四十元、其時另一證券帮塞出數十兩、一度又撳低至四千零三十七元、後匯市突報趨緊、激動人心、銀樓帮首來撈進、立跳三元、爲四千零四十元、後再以證券帮及某銀號競買、遂步高十五元、銀號互做十兩、爲四千零五十五元、旋以某金號見高塞出回落四元、某金號售予錢兌出二十兩、爲四千零五十一元作午收價、午後因外匯繼續略軟、開市遂抬起八元、金號進銀樓帮二十兩、爲四千零五十九元、嗣因證券帮趁高獲利復出、且買戶吃胃淡薄、遂回落九元、證券帮出錢兌業十兩、爲四千零五十元、後散戶稍來拖入、復提高至四千零五十五元、入後某現金號吐出、再形回跌、金號賣予證券帮二十兩、爲四千零五十一元作晚收價、而果比上週末軋漲十元、全天三十一元上落、現金號之本脾金售出價、照烚赤較高數元、收進减低二十元、現標金照掛牌金小五十餘元、均鮮成交、</p>
<p>飾金屹立不動</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、仍無變更、大同行依舊懸四百十元、新同行與上價相同、收進减低十五元光景、</p>
<h3>外幣升降互見</h3>
<p>昨日外幣、動盪未定、市價升降五見英美金鎊、供求稀少、市况穩定、英美金票、需要復盛、市價堅挺、晨初英金票升爲四十六元、美金票升爲十二元五角一分、午後市况更堅、美余票一度升達十二元五角七分、終因美匯緊勢甚微、市價回平、晚市爲十二元五角、香港票因港滙供給暢盛、市價跟隨鬆軟、法郞安南票、未見需要、市價稍疲、斐律濱票緊步美金票後、昂貴微升、日金票稍堅秀、晚市爲一元二角六分、朝鮮票晚市亦升爲一元零四分、昨日市價、英金票升二角、美金票升七分、香港票降五厘、法郞票降二厘、安南票降三分、斐律濱票升五分、其他各幣未更、</p>
<h3>外滙鬆後　頗有結進</h3>
<p>外滙昨日市况、滙年掛牌、仍無變更、英美滙暗市、雖值週初、但仍無生色、蓋因本日國內消息複雜、故投機商多數仍靜以待變、未敢動作、當日情况、先鬆後回、終則較上週末稍軟、至晨開均平、嗣經外行華比首來吐出、再加港電與華商互塞繼後、驟硬達四便士八七五及八元〇六二五、旋以洋行界見賤略吸、且外行對於七項賣價、頗有吃胃、是以爲狀轉定、呆滯殊久、直至午刻、不意滙豐突來吸購、更加沙遜多頭略來加碼、故市勢反吿緊軟、迨至午收、祗爲四便士八二八二五、及七元九六八七五、午後狀態極靜、惟市勢繼續略緊、結果以四便士八一二五及七元九三七五收盤、比上週六英緊〇三一二五、美軟〇六二五、期貨潛勢與現貨同途、</p>
<p>港方初有塞出</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條及美銀價均休業無電、倫敦生金呆定、滙兌英對美滬法等各滙俱平、美對英長一二五、對滬未更、對法大三七五、中央掛牌各滙如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金四便士八四三七五、美滙八不意迨至午刻、滙、突來吸購、加之沙遜亦略吃進、致市象反吿軟化、迄至午收、銀行現貨賣價、英金祗四便士八二八一二五、美匯七元九六八七五、比農開軋緊〇一五六二五　　　六二五、</p>
<p>美滙八元進</p>
<p>後市交易淸稀、惟　　　行頗有吃胃、故　　　形稍緊、某行吸進外行　　　匯七元九六八七五及有利　　納同行本月份英金四便士八　八一二五、迄至晚收、銀行現　賣價、英金四便士八一二五、義匯七元九三七五、下月期芙金四便士七五、美匯七元八一二五、結果比上週末現期英均緊〇三一二五、美各軟〇六二五、</p>
<p>香港滙市平穩</p>
<p>香港二十二日電、今晨滙市開盤吿平、各滙概無變動、十一時三十分平穩、各滙仍無榮辱、交易淸淡、下午二時三十分開盤平穩、申匯現貨升一元、爲三百〇六元、後收申滙現貨續升一元、爲三百〇七元、</p>
<p>天津亦無上落</p>
<p>天津二十二日電、今雖匯市開盤吿平、英美匯價均無上落、申匯微升二角五分、爲一百〇五元、「聯鈔」暗盤微昂半元、爲一百〇五元、</p>
<p>貼同稍挫</p>
<p>昨匯劃票據貼現率、續趨平疲每千元初仍二十四元半旋稍下挫、午刻爲二十四元、下午呆平、終仍二十四元、比上週六再降五角、錢業公會拆息晨午兩市均掛一角二分、又趨呆定云、</p>
<h3>證券內債多方　人數擁擠　丙戊曾出五十一元</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨日市况、初以中美借款之說、而再上騰環境消息、仍在閃爍不定、且多頭過於擁擠、一時上漲無力、丙戊兩種曾穿出五十一元關、旋又打破、浮多出籠、隨時可見、市便將光行回跌後、再行轉漲、亦未可知、昨日經過、午前趨勢甚堅、信孚大豐聯益買進大通鴻大天生賣出、茂泰同一順及十六號胃量亦佳、丙種曾一見五十一元之高價、戊種亦到五十一元外、源裕同康同裕恒孚均有供出、午後人心稍懈、丙戊種頓又復破入五十一元、久豐聯益雖有吃胃、但胡鶴記同順均有供給、故比午前回小二三角、全日結果、仍係漲一角至二角半、成交總數的共七八十萬元、茲列簡表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易成交寗波和豐紗廠股十股、價爲一百八十元正、十元正、</p>
<p>衆業公所股市、開盤極軟、下午形勢轉佳、各種信託公司股、上漲允勁、國際信託股一度高達十四元六角、揚子銀公司股十二元七角、上海銀公司股則爲十八元、雖然在此高價下、不乏獲利了結者、收盤市况極穩、雖假期已迫、活躍力亦未稍滅、橡皮股略有需求、</p>
<h3>糖市　粗白略好</h3>
<p>昨糖市略見振色、公會劃盤現貨二四粗白升五角、本棧五十六元半、外棧新到五十六元九角、老貨五十六元五角至三角、油包五十五元半、轉口貨四十五元半、太古車白無甚更動、B嘜西棧五十七元半、東淺五十七元、餘照退、H嘜車未四十二元、荷赤四十四元、本綿白及一號冰仍無上落、國糖聞暗盤略有成交、價與前彷彿、以實銷不多、大結束前不易轉好云、昨由海口裝來糖一千六百九十包、又香港來一百二十六包、</p>
<h3>紗花　客胃轉活　紗價上升　期貨交易熱鬧</h3>
<p>紗市略見穩定、同時客帮實需較爲活絡一些、港帮對於細紗納胃允健、而內地帮對於二一支紗亦有需要、於此一來、人心良好、多頭方面、復來拉提、二月期貨雙馬心思又見與奮、但存貨依然濃厚、有一部份拋出期貨、亦不乏人也、</p>
<p>現紗晨開人氣和平、而外匯又聞放長、塲內買者不旺、二十支雙馬開盤價爲七百二十六元、旋以多頭心思堅挺、某某等又來拖進期貨、同時應帮買進幾包、人心轉堅、市盤徐徐回升、雙馬到七百三十一元、查半日間各帮成交統計二千四百三十包、行情二十支雙馬漲三元半、天女漲二元、雙地球漲三元、廠方由永安廠開出二十支特金城一二百二十包、價爲七百二十五元、叉三二支特金城一百四十包、價爲九百三十八元至九百四十三元、茲將各帮買去之額量分列如左、</p>

<h3>大結束前　棉銷不旺　市價無大變遷</h3>
<p>本棉交易仍屬不旺、但氣勢尙穩、廠方需要依然平淡、此因廢歷年關逼近、大家準備結束、以待來年再作舉動也、就此而論、在此年內、棉市恐無多大變遷矣、蘇北來源、計通花一千一百四十包、常陰沙五十四包、茲將現棉成交情形列左、</p>
<p>外棉市價、紐約棉市、晨初開盤較爲靜寂、然殊堅定、現貨商略有購買、及空頭稍有抵補、結果市况整日靜寂異常、棉價亦無甚軒輊、較之上日凝跌二三磅音、印度棉市連同預測漲一羅比餘、埃及利物浦停市、</p>

<h3>波拉與麵包師</h3>
<p>— 黃嘉音</p>
<p>波拉死了，美國死硬的孤立派的首腦人物波拉死了。</p>
<p>在國際事件上，波拉的觀點也許有偏狹錯誤的而不正確地方，可是我們不能太怪他，人　總是有弱點的。</p>
<p>把他當個人來看，波拉是　　敢說話，有作爲，忠於人生理想，存心替大衆服務的人在這一點上，我們無論如何是應該敬重他的。</p>
<p>是的，他曾經反對美國羅斯　　統所推行的新政。可是他的目的是在於保全民衆的購實力。</p>
<p>在一九三四年，他爲了關切貧民的生活問題，會經高聲疾呼，反對麵包每塊加價一分的决議案。他爲此特地去訪問位麵包師。</p>
<p>麵包師向他叫苦連天，說他絕對反對麵包漲價　分的决定，並問波拉該怎麼辦。波拉叫他照原價出售，要是有人敢控吿他的話，他願意挺身出來做義務辯護律師。</p>
<p>結果美國全國的麵包都跌價一分了。雖然，祇是一分錢的差別，可是，對於平民生活上的帮助，却不祇一分錢。</p>
<p>報紙上說，波拉死後，美國舉國悲悼。這並沒有甚麼奇怪，因爲他曾經做全國民衆的朋友。</p>
<p>軍備</p>
<h3>短小精悍的新武器</h3>
<p>— 莫名</p>
<p>十六吋海岸砲和十四吋鐵道砲的時代巳經過去了，現在軍事的重心，漸漸轉移到短小精悍的武器上面。巨型大砲的威力誠然足以驚心動魄，但這種大傢伙的缺點就是太笨重太遲緩，它們只能被固定在陣綫的後方，而其破壞力所能及的也只是敵軍陣綫的後方。至於新式的小型砲則輕便簡易，流動性極大，可以隨最前綫的兵士同進退，而且可以隨心操縱，儘揀敵人最虛弱之點，予以猛烈的直接的攻擊，而收殲敵的最大效力。</p>
<p>本文所要介紹的是美國三種最新式的小型砲：</p>
<p>第一種是「坦克砲』。它脫胎於世界大戰時著名的三七　加農砲，但砲身加長一倍，砲彈推進力也擴大，因此造成了可性的速度和穿透力。它所發射出來的砲彈，飛行時幾成一直綫，任何坦克車當走近距離一千碼的危險地帶時，就非被它轟透不可，而且透入之後，還能在內部爆炸，經此嚴重的破壞，任何堅强的陸上怪物也就無能爲力了。</p>
<p>這種砲裝有橡皮胎輪，可以拖在高速度汽車後面任意移動，就是在非常粗劣的路面上，每小時五十英哩的速度也絕無困難。砲身全重半噸，四五個人可以把它扛着飛奔。</p>
<p>輕便高射砲</p>
<p>第二種是流動式自動高射砲、這種高射砲　成的火綱真是厲害得無以復加，它在發射時活像一架大型的機關槍，每分鐘能射出一百廿發爆炸性極烈的砲彈。而且發射的方向還可任意旋轉，角度也無限制，可以直射，可以斜射，也可以平射。它的砲彈導炸管極爲靈敏，甚至觸及飛機的翼子也能爆發，因此新式的全金屬飛機就最配它的胃口。</p>
<p>這種高射砲極爲輕便，也可以用汽車拖來拖去，而安置在任何地點，這上它最大的優點，也就是命名的由來。</p>
<p>短射程臼礮</p>
<p>第三種是短射程臼礮，它的射程最大是二千碼，最近七十五碼，剛巧是手溜彈所不能及到的。而它發射出來的三磅半重砲彈則威力遠在一切步槍子彈之上，同時它又輕便無比，包括附件在內全部重量五十磅，只需一人之力，就可以把它服侍得周周到，因此它可以說是戰塲上最實用的武器。這種臼礮極爲小巧玲瓏，兩脚深的濠溝或者幾尺高的灌木就可以把它遮得掩一乾二凈。還有一個優點就是它在發彈時不生絲毫烟霧，所以即使在極近的距離，敵人也絕難測出它的地位。</p>
<p>據軍事家的意見，波蘭倘若有幾百門這種新式的小型砲，去年九月中的歷史就將大大的改變，目前世界的大勢史不知將是怎樣的副棋局呢！</p>

<h3>給母親的信</h3>
<p>— 默然</p>
<p>在第一次世界大戰中，英國軍官中有一個二十八歲的中尉名希斯，於一九一五年七月十一日在法國寫一封信去安慰他的母親，函中表現一種很豁達的人生觀，文字樸實自然，情感眞摯動人，令人讀後感慨無限。希斯中尉於同年十月八日在歐洲前綫陣亡，返讀這封遺書更覺得浮生若夢。</p>
<p>我親愛的母親：</p>
<p>今天雖是星期日，可是我們幾小時後又要照常工作了。我覺得我要吿訴你一些久已想說的話。當我走上征程，和你作別的時候，我曾對你說過：我心裏覺得最憂煩不安的，是你因爲我上前綫或陣亡而到感悲哀。現在死亡的日子已近，所以我也有同樣的感想。我覺得死並不是很大的恐慌。我覺得如果我陣亡了，眞眞感到悲哀的一定是你以及其他愛我的人們。我說在寫這封信同你說明，請你別爲我悲哀。</p>
<p>我們素來把死生的界限分得很淸楚。可是在我們的一生中，我們有一半的時間是花在睡夢中的，所以當我們淸醒的時候，我們知道我們常常只是活了一半的。人生事實上是種質素而不是一些數量；在人生的某一些時候中，生命似乎是極偉大，極有價值的，以鐘錶去衡量其時刻，反而覺得沒有意義。這些寳貴的時候具有非常宏偉的力量，我們不知道它們何時終止，因爲它們能够渲染着我們的餘生，永遠成爲力量和歡樂的泉源。如果我們能够保存這種可貴的時候，而去掉其餘的時間，那是最好沒有的事。正如這些歡樂的時候充溢着我們自己的生命那樣，我希望它們也會在我們的親友的經騐中持久下去，在人們的生命中發揮威力，成造一種永久的重生。讓我舉一件個人的事情爲例。當我在欣賞昔樂的時候，我最能感覺到人生的眞意義；我希望那些愛我而比我後死的人們，能够把我對音樂的愛好不但常做一種過去的記憶，而且當做能够增加音樂之美的力量。又如，我們是愛故鄕的平原的；如果我陣亡了，我希望那些聯想」不至便你太過悲哀。我希望你不但把那平原視爲過去的記憶，而且會使它灌進你的生命裏，使你在那邊過假期時會感到一種新的喜悅。如果我陣亡了，請你至少別讓我所愛的事物使你痛苦，而反使之增加你的快樂，因爲我在這些事物中感到快樂。這麼一來，我所有的快樂便可以繼續存在下去。我眞不忍想到你爲我的死而痛苦啊。</p>

<h3>生活與信仰</h3>
<p>— 楊同芳</p>
<p>生活與信仰。有着密切的聯繫。許多人感到生活的空虛和乏味，像永遠陷於黑暗的深淵，我不着一點光與熱，就因爲他們的生活中沒有堅定的信仰。缺乏信仰的生活，有如失卻指針的大海中的孤舟，徬徨</p>
<p>不過，這裏所說的生活的信仰，並不是專指那些狹義的宗敎與主義、而是指一切反映於人類意識中的足以推進和提高生活向上的動力，這種動力，是爭取人類生活價值的發酵素，任何人都不能少了牠的。</p>
<p>經過歷史上長時期奮鬥和研磨而得的許多偉大的思想和眞理，都是我們生活中應該吸取和提揀的資料，我們須把這些偉大的思想和眞理，作爲生活的目標；使我們的生活能因這種堅定的信仰而奮發前進，努力向上。</p>
<p>世界不少的偉大人物，當他們遭受環境的磨折時，未嘗不感到沮喪和失望，但他們仍然鼓着勇氣，對於追求光明和快樂的希望始終沒有消失，他們舉究述到成功之路。這沒有別的原因，生活的信仰鼓勵着他們，激動着他們。</p>
<p>生活在艱苦困頓的境地裏的人們，應該亟早克服失望，沮喪，憂　愁悶的魔鬼，快加强生活的信仰吧。生活的信仰，可以增加追尋光與熱的勇氣，可以發揮個人內在的潛力，和充實生活的意義。從此我們將小會再感到生活的空虛和乏味了，因爲生活的信仰作了前導，牠會指示我們怎樣地去生活，怎樣地生活得更有意義</p>
<p>到了我們由空虛和乏味的生活中奮鬥出來而走向有信仰的生活的大道時，就如在枯寂的沙漢上望見了綠洲一般的快慰。</p>

<p>我們對我們的國家，應該像女人對她們所愛的男人一樣。一個愛丈夫的妻子，除了停止批評她的丈夫，叫他的丈夫改進以外，隨便甚麼事都情願替他的丈夫做。我們對於我們的國家，也應該注以同樣熱情而敏銳的眼光。我們應該愛護我們的國家，可是也要不斷地指出國家的錯誤。國中的危險份子不是批評家，而是那些空口唱高調的所謂愛國份子。　英國名作家勃里斯黎的話。</p>

<p>游藝界</p>
<h3>實行布衣運動</h3>
<p>— 守迅</p>
<p>最近在靑靑電影讀了嚴次平君「提倡電影界布衣運動」的文章，我非常贊同此舉，的確在這個非常時期中應該力戒奢華而崇尙節的，尤其是我們電影界中人，一般年靑的及少奶奶式的影迷，都異常注意電影演員的服裝從而效允。所以如果演員們平日布衣素服，她或他一定也起而模仿且認布衣爲　一種漂亮的經濟的大方的服裝。</p>
<p>在電影界中，除了少數地位較高，薪俸較大之外，其餘的薪水差不多都楚微乎其渺的，在百物昂貴的今日，本來已感覺困難了，可是他們都認爲　一個明星，是必須有華麗的服裝，吾則將引起人們的輕視，有失大明星的派頭，所以雖處在窘急的境况中，而服裝却非考究不可，這實在是大錯特錯。希望我們電影界同人，以後不要再有這奢華的惡習慣，一致起來擁護布衣運動，實行布衣主義。</p>
<h3>一年一度的「說會書」</h3>
<p>— 聿修</p>
<p>上海戲院，每到廢歷年關快要專賣店箱的時候，例必舉行一度「會戲」，書塲也有這種老例，一到舊歷歲尾，各一塲東」紛紛拉攏「大響擋」，舉行「會書」，情形相當熱鬧。</p>
<p>舉行「會書」的本意，原來是爲　說書業中的孤寡貧病，募集扶助經費，所以對聽客不供給茶水，參加會書的從業員，只有車錢，而沒沒「份子」，塲東也完全盡義務，不拿任何費用，以减少開支，而加多扶助經費的數目，可是現在上海各書塲所舉行的會書，籌價定的加倍高，擋數拉的特別多，「份子」照拿，大小照拆，說書從業員和塲東二方面，共同恃爲　「過年盤纏」的大宗來源，和原來救濟性質的善舉，已經不同了。</p>
<p>「會書」對說書從業員的技藝方面，還含有一種比較，考試的作用。一個平常不見經傳的普通脚色，只要能够在會書中唱紅起來，保管不難成爲　大響擋；像「飛機英烈的張鴻聲，和評話　　　　，過去　是在會書中冒出來，因而遂一舉成名的。</p>
<p>「送客」在會書中無疑是一個中要的脚色，也可以說就是這一塲會書中的臺柱子，可是非有種專門技藝，能叫聽客十分滿意，是很難把這許多聽客完全快快活活送掉的；說不定因送不掉而挨到「倒面湯」喊下來，那就未免要當塲出醜，大大丢臉了。所以對於「送客」，不但初出「社道」的「小晚生」不敢貿然據任，就是一等紅的大響檔，也莫不視爲　畏途。</p>
<p>往年廢歷大除夕，滙泉樓有全夜會書，俗稱之爲　「賴債書」。因爲　有好些滿身債務的聽客，弄到無法調排時，就索性統統來一倘「相應不理」，「大年夜飯」老早吃開，就向書塲裏鑽，聽到元旦早晨，在晨光熹微中再到虹廟去看北里姊妹燒香，飽餐秀色，倒也是作樂之一法。</p>
<h3>情天歌侶女主角麥唐納小史</h3>
<p>— 明明</p>
<p>珍妮麥唐納的誕生日期是六月十八日，她是三姊妹最小的一個，剛剛三歲，便在她姊姊的舞蹈學校裏，舉行獨唱。獻身紅　毺上，她從小便有這個志願。</p>
<p>有一個夏天，她的父親帶了她到紐約去辦公。父親自管自的夫接洽公務，她却到戲院裏去探望姊姊。墊本老板瞧見這位面目姣麗，秀髪如雲的小姑娘，答應她試習兩個禮拜，結果，她的父親舉家搬到紐約，以便她姊妹倆來居住。</p>
<p>在戲院表演一些時候，她在「愛爾蘭」劇中，担任了配角。接着她又得到表演的機會，雖然是小部份的演出，恰巧劇本著作人和她丈夫參觀，她倆同被麥唐納的演技迷醉了，立刻和她簽訂了合同，在「魔術戒指」一劇担任主角，逐漸進入明星的階級。</p>
<p>她在百老滙歌唱「安琪拉」一劇時，便有人聘請她做李却狄克斯的對象，第一度試鏡頭。等到導演怪作劉別謙攝製「璇宮艷史」，各處訪求片中女主角，恰巧這位導演看過她從前試鏡頭的片段，特地到紐約來禮聘她，簽訂了兩年的合同，一直紅到現在。</p>
<p>她在米高梅獅牌旗幟下，更製作了不少的歌唱鉅片，像「桃花恨」「鸞鳳和鳴」「比翼雙飛」「戰地笙歌」，都是賣座力絕强的片子。現在她的新作品「情天歌侶」，是張情感非常濃厚的歌唱鉅片，使人迥腸盪氣，涕淚不知何從，她的表演，出神入化，緊緊抓住了觀衆的情緒，像這樣多才多藝的女藝人，無怪全美影迷公舉她是一九三年的電影皇后了。</p>

<h3>上海劇藝社　試用旋轉舞台</h3>
<p>上海劇藝社第二期公演自遷往辣斐後，接連上演二個大劇目－「祖國」與陳圓圓」，極得觀衆的歡迎。第三個劇目爲　顧仲彝改編的「戀愛與陰謀」，爲　徐渠導演，而由新近被聘爲「孔夫子」女主角的莫容婉兒及維拉徐立胡導等合演。該劇內容頗利於利用旋轉舞台，而辣斐的旋轉舞台自造成以來，從未用過，現在也就很想乘機試用一下。不過，這台旣未用過於前，是否能用，尙未可知。所以事先得試騐一下。大概一二天內就可决定。如果沒有意外而能實現的話，則在話劇界還是破天荒的盛舉。附帶可以報吿的，英茵從重慶來滬，參加合衆拍攝「西太后」。劇藝社與她有着「血統「上的關係，所以廿一日上午請她來社里談談內地的戲劇狀况，她談鋒甚健，關於內地劇人動態，說得頗爲群盡，聽者也興奮得很。</p>

<h3>Chinese Army Divides Forces to Press Guangzhou, Completing Encirclement; Reports of Victory for Chinese Forces in Yongqin Road and Zhennanwei Areas; Japanese Troops Routed in Fierce Battle Northeast of Suixian</h3>
<p>Hong Kong – Japanese troops harassing northern Guangdong, having been defeated by the Chinese army, retreated to Guangzhou. The Chinese army, taking advantage of the victory, divided its forces to pursue and attack, achieving great gains. An encirclement has now been completed. The Japanese troops in Guangzhou are extremely panicked, and Japanese residents and military families are packing up to flee. Financial disorder prevails in the city, and prices are soaring. Japanese military scrip and counterfeit currency are being rejected by the people. Guangzhou has become a dead city. (22nd dispatch)</p>
<p>Somewhere on the Guangdong Front Line – After the Japanese troops in Zengcheng were besieged by the Chinese on three sides, the Japanese reinforced heavily day and night on the 20th, engaging in fierce battles with the Chinese forces for a day and two nights. Chinese officers and soldiers fought valiantly, launching more than a dozen fierce assaults, breaking into the city, and engaging the Japanese in street fighting. The Japanese also resisted stubbornly with concentrated artillery fire. The Chinese achieved considerable results and then safely withdrew on the 21st, awaiting another opportunity to attack. (22nd dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing – According to today's news, in the Zhennanwei area east of Yongqin Road, after three days of fierce fighting, an estimated 1,500 Japanese soldiers were killed and several Japanese officers were captured alive. However, since last night, 3,000 newly arrived Japanese troops equipped with advanced weaponry, heavy artillery, and a cavalry unit have launched a counterattack against the Chinese forces. Fierce fighting is ongoing. (22nd United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Fancheng – The Japanese troops northeast of Suixian have now increased to over 5,000. They have been engaged in fierce battles with the Chinese army in the Yinjiaodian area for several days. On the 21st, the Chinese launched a pincer attack on the Japanese from the left, right, front, and rear, killing over 1,000 Japanese soldiers and driving the routed Japanese troops towards Tumengchong near Gaocheng.

<h3>Chinese Army in Southeastern Shanxi Achieves Glorious Victories Again; Contested Battle Occurs Northeast of Gaoping, Japanese Army Defeated with Over a Thousand Killed</h3>
<p>Yu Ji – Amidst heavy snow, the loyal and brave soldiers of the Chinese army fought bitterly against the cold, repeatedly achieving extraordinary feats.

Chinese people in the northeastern provinces are generally prohibited from purchasing rice for consumption. According to foreign consulate officials, they have no choice but to ask their Japanese servants to purchase rice to supply to their Chinese employees and servants at home. The rice coupon system will be implemented first in areas with a high concentration of Japanese residents, as the demand for rice exceeds the supply in those areas. The "Manchukuo" government's Ministry of Agriculture is still experimenting with methods of cooking white rice and sorghum together. (22nd International News Service dispatch)</p>

<h3>Churchill's Speech: Reactions from Various Countries - Unfavorable Impression in Belgium</h3>
<p>London - British First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill's broadcast speech on Saturday night, advocating that small, weak, and neutral countries rise up together to resist aggressors, was welcomed by the French. However, it did not create a good impression in Belgium and Italy. Roman political circles claim that Italian newspapers often state that England and France are trying their best to expand the war, intending to turn all of Europe into a battlefield. Judging from Churchill's remarks, the Italian newspapers' criticism is not without reason. Although Belgian official circles have not yet expressed their opinions, the Belgian National Newspaper, a conservative publication affiliated with the Catholic party, titled Churchill's speech as "Churchill's Strange Accusations Against Neutral Countries." However, French newspapers uniformly welcomed it. The Paris Times stated that only the absolute victory of England and France can protect the people of Europe from death. The Strong Resolve Newspaper hopes that Churchill's remarks will be heeded and suggests that the Allied powers establish a liaison between the Dutch Group, the Scandinavian Peninsula Group, the Balkan Entente, and the Sadabad Pact (i.e., the group of Turkey, Iran, Iraq, and Afghanistan).

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>How America Should Act Promptly</h3>
<p>The validity of the US-Japan Commercial Treaty has only three days left; it is widely rumored that there are intermittent talks between the US and Japan in Tokyo, and the Japanese ambassador to the US, is doing his best, making it impossible to say that there will be absolutely no achievements within three days; but observing the general trend, it is worth predicting that the great turning point between the US and Japan in the Far East is imminent. Originally, this matter was the result of Japan's own fault, and America's initiative will certainly be successful; Japan's aggressive policy will be greatly hit, but it is a matter of time; America's self-defense action for its own legitimate rights and interests will benefit China's resistance war. If the cause and effect are like this, there should be no unexpected changes; but after several months of brewing, on the eve of the expiration of the commercial treaty, the US government and parliament have not yet made a firm decision on banning the raw materials of vehicles and fire; the reason for this is mostly because America has formed public opinion has its inevitable time; currently in the process of time. On the Japanese side, it is hoped that after the expiration of the commercial treaty on February 26, it will be able to establish a temporary agreement with the United States, so that the most-favored-nation treatment clause can be extended for a certain period; on the American side, there are still some people who hope that Japan can earnestly provide guarantees, respect American interests in China, as a prerequisite for the establishment of temporary measures. In fact, America's hope for Japan is ultimately a false wish. Since Japan's invasion of China, according to the US Secretary of State Hull's announcement, there have been as many as 600 cases of damage to American interests in China caused by Japanese military actions. To name a few major ones, such as the American gunboat Panay being sunk in the Yangtze River, and the China National Aviation Corporation plane being destroyed in South China; others such as the destruction of American industries by Japanese aircraft, from August 1937 to September 1939, there were more than 150 cases, most of which were churches, hospitals, and educational institutions established by Americans in China, with a total of 36 churches and schools destroyed, 25 American citizens injured, and 24 killed. This is a part of the losses suffered by the United States, and all of them are still pending, with no resolution at all. Although the United States has protested many times, the Japanese authorities have always ignored it, mostly giving empty words, and even ignoring it. Not only that, but the number of pending cases has increased, and actions that damage American interests and events that insult American residents continue to emerge. The former Japanese Foreign Minister Nomura, who claimed to be a friend of the United States, did not hesitate to put on a smiling face for the renewal of the commercial treaty, as if he dared not ignore it anymore; however, the public opinion controlled by the Japanese authorities has repeatedly roared and challenged the United States; who cannot see through their bluster? Who cannot prove their lack of sincerity? Just like the Japanese army in North China: in Tianjin, they usually oppress American residents, and recently they have become more intense; their commanding officer of the Japanese garrison army, Honma, publicly demonstrated against the United States when the American ambassador to China, Johnson, went to the north, saying: "If Washington renews the commercial treaty and shows a new friendly gesture to Japan, then the Japanese should do their best to give convenience to the rights and interests and careers of the Americans, but if there is no goodwill, the relations between the two countries will deteriorate further, starting with the abolition of the treaty." Honma's so-called "deterioration" did not explain its content, but at least it can be known that he is preparing to make more difficulties for American businessmen in China. Now Nomura has not achieved anything with the United States and has stepped down; his successor Arita, although follows the old rules, still adheres to the foreign policy of the previous cabinet; but Arita also wants to win over Britain, so as to face the United States on the one hand and contain China on the other; such a trick has become an open secret due to clues. But look at the Japanese newspapers, saying, "If we cannot have both the new order in East Asia and the new treaty with the United States, then we have to abandon the latter." The so-called new order in East Asia here is to reduce China to a vassal state, exclusively occupied by Japan, and to exclude the rights and interests of third countries from China, another term for closing the door of China. Evidence of this can be found in the so-called compromise conditions revealed in Hong Kong the day before yesterday: Japan obtains economic advantages in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, and occupies the highest position on certain islands in South China, and agrees on new agreements on customs trade tax sources, aviation, postal services, telephone and general survey, giving Japan special interests and conveniences (see yesterday's newspaper report on Hong Kong Reuters); this is the specific explanation of the so-called "East Asian New Order", truly controlling China, but how can it not completely destroy America's policies and propositions, as well as treaty rights and obligations! American people have the "courage to judge right and wrong strictly", and American politicians are also the strongest opponents of militarism; of course, they will not maintain trade because of it, or greedily obtain "blood money", putting right and wrong aside, and giving material resources to militarism; then, after three days, taking effective and constructive actions for peace, so that the aggressors are hit and the invaded are benefited, is what the American government and people should act promptly and have an inescapable duty to do!</p>
<h3>Japanese Government Decides Not to Impose Differential Tariffs on the United States, Avoiding a Tariff War Under No-Treaty Status, and Absolutely No Concessions on the China Issue</h3>
<p>Tokyo: As the Japan-U.S. Treaty of Commerce and Navigation will expire on the 26th of this month, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that it is virtually impossible to conclude a provisional agreement or establish a formal treaty before the 26th. Therefore, from the 26th, Japan and the United States will be in a no-treaty status. The Ministry has clarified the fundamental policies held by the Japanese government to cope with this no-treaty status, as follows: Regarding the Japan-U.S. commercial relationship under a no-treaty status, the U.S. government already issued a statement on December 22nd of last year, based on President Grant's proclamation of 1872, that the United States has decided not to impose differential tariffs on Japanese goods if Japan does not impose differential tariffs on American goods. At the same time, it also declared that tonnage taxes and lighthouse taxes would remain the same, and it also intends to seek appropriate measures regarding residence rights and other matters recently, so as not to cause any obstacles. Therefore, the Japanese government has also decided not to impose differential tariffs on the United States. Relevant parties are currently preparing an imperial edict on this matter, and it has been decided to announce it on the 24th of this month and implement it from the 27th. Furthermore, appropriate measures will also be taken regarding tonnage taxes, lighthouse taxes, and residence rights issues. In this way, based on the friendly measures of the Japanese and American governments, the worst possible situation imaginable under a no-treaty status, such as a retaliatory tariff war resulting from differential tax rates, can be avoided. It is expected that Japan-U.S. commercial relations will remain as before and will not be hindered. However, due to the expiration of the treaty guaranteeing commercial relations, Japan-U.S. trade will be exposed to an unstable state in the future. If the United States takes advantage of this no-treaty status to exert pressure on Japan, it may lead to a regrettable situation. The tangible and intangible losses resulting from this will naturally become the burden of both Japan and the United States. Therefore, the Japanese government earnestly hopes to conclude a commercial treaty. Just like the U.S. government, standing in the exact same position, it always has the same hope. Therefore, concluding a Japan-U.S. commercial treaty and rebuilding the friendly relationship between the two countries is the responsibility of both Japan and the United States. Based on the above views, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs hereby declares that regarding the various pending issues in China that the United States hopes to resolve, those that should be resolved based on Japan's independent views should be resolved urgently. As for the principled policy, it is determined to adopt a non-retreating attitude, not yielding a single step. Japan will also not impose undue pressure on American interests in China. Japan's policy is to fully express its actual autonomous spirit and earnestly hope for the conclusion of a new treaty from the standpoint of Japan-U.S. commerce. (Alliance News Agency dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<p>Tokyo: According to a statement by Japanese spokesman Suma, yesterday representatives of the Japanese Embassy in the United States discussed technical difficulties after the abolition of the Japan-U.S. Commercial Treaty with officials of the U.S. State Department. It is reported that the issue of "moral sanctions" by the United States was mentioned during the consultation. The Japanese spokesman said that regarding this kind of sanction, the Japanese side "considers it unsatisfactory." It is heard that before the commercial treaty is abolished, the Japanese side will issue an order to temporarily not impose discriminatory tariffs on imported American goods after the abolition of the commercial treaty. However, the date of issuance of this order has not yet been determined. We are now watching the development of the negotiations in Washington. (United Press dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<p>Tokyo: According to a statement by a spokesman for the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs today, rumors that the United States will exert pressure on Japan are inaccurate. If there is any pressure, it is only a moral embargo. This moral embargo has so far been limited to aircraft and started 18 months ago. It is now heard that the United States intends to extend this moral embargo to aircraft fuel. However, ordinary kerosene and crude oil are unlikely to be embargoed. (Associated Press dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<p>Tokyo: When meeting with reporters today, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed that an order related to the import of American goods is under consideration by the Japanese government. However, the date of the issuance of the order has not yet been decided. The spokesperson made this statement in response to a question from a reporter regarding a report in the Asahi Shimbun. According to a report in the Asahi Shimbun on the 20th of this month, the Japanese government will issue an order on the 24th of this month to take effect on the 27th of this month, stipulating that after the expiration of the U.S.-Japan Commercial Treaty, Japan will not impose discriminatory tariffs on imported American goods. American goods will still receive most-favored-nation treatment. The Japanese authorities will also take appropriate administrative steps to protect the rights of American residents in Japan. The spokesperson continued that the Japanese ambassador to the United States is currently discussing technical issues of great importance to the U.S.-Japan situation with the U.S. State Department. The situation without a treaty not only makes the Japanese people uneasy, but also makes American residents in Japan uneasy. Foreign Minister Arita is very willing and prepared to hold another conversation with the U.S. ambassador. The spokesperson also admitted in response to questions that the meeting between Wang Jingwei, Wang Kemin, and Liang Hongzhi will open tomorrow in Qingdao. Someone asked whether Wang wishes to merge the two regimes in North and South China to form a unified central government, and whether Japan agrees to this. The spokesperson replied that this is in line with the Japanese government's intention. (Reuters dispatch on the 22nd)</p>

<h3>Germans Aboard the Asama Maru Were Captured by the British Navy; Japanese Government and Public Opinion Consider This a Major Insult; Ministry of Foreign Affairs Lodges a Serious Protest with Britain</h3>
<p>Tokyo: The fact that German passengers of military age aboard the Japanese ship Asama Maru, including crew members of the former German ship Columbus which was scuttled, were captured by a British warship yesterday was published by Japanese newspapers this morning with large headlines. One newspaper referred to this as an act of piracy committed by a British cruiser in the ocean off the Japanese coast. The Asahi Shimbun said that the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs attaches great importance to this matter, and said that at the beginning of this month, the British Admiralty notified the Japanese naval attaché that Britain would detain the crew members of the Columbus aboard the Asama Maru. It is heard that the Japanese government replied on January 13 that the Japanese side could only hand over Germans currently serving in the military. However, yesterday afternoon, a British cruiser captured 21 people, who cannot be regarded as active-duty soldiers. It is expected that a spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will issue a statement on Japan's position. The captain of the Asama Maru told reporters, "The search party sent by the British cruiser to board the Asama Maru was very polite and expressed their apologies for having to stop the Japanese ship. However, they said that they were exercising the rights conferred by international law because they knew that the Asama Maru was carrying Germans listed on the active-duty roster and wanted to search them. I had no reason to refuse this request. I thought that goods transported to Germany were already being detained by the British side, and the Germans carried were contraband. Moreover, the British side's request was backed by force, and resistance would be futile. The British side also said that most of the Germans on board were crew members of standard oil tankers." A crew member of the Asama Maru said, "Although we cannot refuse the British side's request, our blood is boiling." (Reuters dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Yoshizo Suma stated here today that "The 'Asama Maru' incident occurred near our country's (referring to Japan) coast. We feel extremely displeased about this action." (United Press dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<p>Tokyo: At 5:50 p.m. on the 22nd, officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs invited the British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, to the Ministry, and Vice Minister Yamaya handed him a note of protest from the Japanese government to Britain regarding the Japanese ship Asama Maru incident. (Alliance News Agency dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<p>San Francisco, USA: According to sources in Tokyo, 22 crew members of the German mail ship "Columbus" (which was scuttled in December of last year) recently abandoned the Japanese mail ship Asama Maru in the port of San Francisco, attempting to return home via Japan and the Soviet Union. However, they were intercepted by a British warship in a certain sea area, and all the crew members were immediately arrested. This statement was firmly denied by the U.S. Immigration Bureau, which said, "All the crew members of the Columbus are still on Ellis Island (the location of the Immigration Bureau) outside New York Harbor. All kinds of rumors are not true." On the Japanese side, the Nippon Yusen Kaisha admitted that the Asama Maru might have carried some Germans, but declined to comment further. (Havas dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Japanese newspapers have reacted strongly to the Asama Maru incident. This is partly because British sailors arrested Germans on the Asama Maru, and mostly because of the location where the incident occurred, which was very close to the Japanese coast. The Nichi Nichi Shimbun stated, "Ruffians are now wandering in front of our door and must be driven away. Whether this is based on international law or not, it is an unforgivable and crude act." The Yomiuri Shimbun stated, "We have been deceived. This incident actually happened on the sea off Yokohama. I wonder how the experts of our navy feel." The Hochi Shimbun stated, "It is unexpected that a violent act occurred in our garden. That British warships are wandering near Tokyo Bay is already a great insult." The Japan Times stated, "This humiliating act must be rectified immediately. The actions of the British warships are like entering a Japanese port and arresting legally residing foreign residents." It is reported that when British warships sent officers and soldiers to board the Asama Maru to demand the 21 Germans, they disregarded the list presented by the ship's purser and took out their own list, searching according to the diagram. The efficiency of the British intelligence agencies can be seen from this. Even the Japanese newspapers admit this. (Havas dispatch on the 23rd)</p>

<p>New York: Handy Harman Company released an annual report on the silver market, stating that the silver market in 1939 can be divided into three stages: (1) From the beginning of the year to June 26, the silver market from foreign exports was maintained stable by the U.S. government's price support of $0.4; (2) In the following four months, from June 27, the world silver market fluctuated and stabilized, and the U.S. Treasury Department reduced the purchase price until October. At that time, the import of silver from Britain and India was not allowed without a license; (3) From then until the end of the year, two silver markets emerged: one was the world market represented by the U.S. Treasury Department's price of $0.35, and the other was the British-Indian market, represented by the British pound exchange rate. At the end of 1938, the amount of silver stored in the U.S. Treasury was 2,589,000,000 net ounces. In 1939, the United States purchased a total of 341,000,000 net ounces of silver, of which 61,000,000 net ounces came from domestic mineral production. At the end of the year, the amount of silver stored in the U.S. Treasury was 2,930,000,000 net ounces. According to the Silver Purchase Act passed in 1934, the goal was 2,910,000,000 net ounces. After five years of implementation, this number has now been exceeded. In 1939, the total supply of silver in the world was 403,000,000 net ounces, which was less than the previous year. The world's consumption of silver in that year was 441,000,000 net ounces, which was also less than the previous year. However, the United States alone purchased 341,000,000 net ounces. If the production of silver does not decrease significantly or consumption does not increase in addition to government purchases, both of which are unlikely to happen at present, the current price of foreign silver can only be maintained by the U.S. Treasury Department's continued purchases. If the U.S. Silver Purchase Act is not repealed, it can be expected that the purchase price may lower the world market price even further. If the circulation of silver is not restricted by artificial means, the current price, even if it rises, cannot be sustained. (Reuters dispatch on the 21st)</p>

<h3>U.S. Newspaper Reports Secret Agreement Between Britain and Japan; British Foreign Office Denies It, Saying Sino-British Harmony Makes Such Rumors Groundless</h3>
<p>London, Washington: The Washington Post quoted a certain member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee as saying that Britain and Japan have reached a secret agreement that Britain will remain neutral if a war breaks out between Japan and the United States. The British Foreign Office denied this. Furthermore, the Foreign Office also stated that the rumor that the British side allows Japan to conquer China in the secret agreement between Britain and Japan is completely groundless, as Sino-British relations are extremely harmonious. The senator was either misled by communist Germans or American isolationist propaganda, leading to these rumors. (United Press dispatch on the 22nd)</p>

<h3>Situation Eases in the Netherlands and Belgium; Dutch Army Set to Resume Regular Leave Tomorrow; Some Belgian Soldiers Will Also Be Demobilized</h3>
<p>The Hague: Regular leave for Dutch army officers and soldiers, which was previously cancelled due to tense border situations, will be resumed if no unexpected events occur before the 24th of this month, according to an official communiqué. The recent easing of the situation is clear evidence of this. According to diplomatic sources, Germany had indeed prepared to invade the Netherlands. However, due to a sudden cold snap, the large amount of resistance from abroad, and conflicting internal opinions, especially between the army and government authorities, Germany finally pulled back from the brink and abandoned the original plan. There is much to tell about the process. Since the afternoon of the 13th of this month, The Hague and Brussels had received reports from various sources that German troops were concentrating on the border. The Dutch government ordered a reduction in railway passenger and freight transport to clear out vehicles specifically for military transport. At the same time, the country's newspapers unanimously criticized the Netherlands for violating neutrality, intending to find a pretext for sending troops. This had already become clear. By the 15th, a German submarine had inexplicably sunk the Dutch ship Aalentscook, falsely accusing the ship of transporting contraband to an "enemy" country. At the same time, the Soviet government delivered threatening notes to Sweden and Norway, accusing them of sympathizing with Finland. The collusion between Germany and the Soviet Union became increasingly apparent. Later, according to reports from various sources, there were as many as 70 German divisions concentrating on the Belgian and Dutch borders. At that time, the tension in the area had reached its peak. Unexpectedly, the weather suddenly turned cold, and heavy snow fell in various places, making the situation change. In addition, the Dutch government calmly responded, taking various preventive measures on the one hand, and remaining calm and not being intimidated on the other. It did not fall into the German trap due to Germany's deliberate provocations. At that time, the Italian government openly invited a Dutch military delegation to visit its armaments factories. The intention behind this was also highly suggestive. The German General Staff, considering that the German troops stationed in the Rhineland area had been there for a long time and had nothing to do, and that morale had already declined, carried out a mobilization to boost morale</p>
<h3>France Punishes Anti-War Women</h3>
<p>Geneva: According to the "Independent" newspaper in Barbinnan, a French woman named Le Floch has been sentenced to two months in prison and a fine of 1,000 francs by a military court for telling her neighbors that fighting against Germany was a meaningless act. The court believed that Le Floch had "indirectly incited French soldiers to betray." (Haitong News Agency dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<h3>Finnish Aircraft Raid the Other Day: Soviet Naval Air Base. Southwestern Finland Continually Bombed; Fires Everywhere; Several Towns Reduced to Ruins</h3>
<p>Stockholm: According to news received here today from Helsinki, yesterday, twenty to thirty foreign air force personnel flew to the Soviet naval base, Kronstadt, and heavily bombed it for about an hour. The Soviets suffered heavy losses. After completing the mission, all pilots safely returned to Finland in their original aircraft. (United Press, 22nd)</p>
<p>Helsinki: Headquarters has just issued a battle report stating that our aircraft fleet bombed the Soviet naval base at Kronstadt. The port is heavily defended and is a key point of the Leningrad Military District. In addition, our bombers bombed two Soviet air bases south of Tallinn, the capital of Estonia, and along the Baltic coast. (Note: According to the mutual assistance agreement between the Soviet Union and Estonia, the Soviet Union has established air bases in Estonia.) (Havas, 21st) In short, the leaders of the German National Socialist Party hold differing views. The invasion of the Netherlands in November of last year failed to materialize due to this. As of now, the internal state remains the same. Although the military authorities are under Hitler's orders, they must carefully weigh the advantages and disadvantages of an advance to the west before making any decisions. This can be asserted. (Havas, 22nd)</p>
<p>London: It is reported that the British government is considering the demobilization of some soldiers recently called up for duty, as they are necessary to maintain the domestic economic life. All of this is a result of the continued relaxation of the tense situation. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>Helsinki: A total of 400 Soviet aircraft bombed cities in southern and southwestern Finland yesterday afternoon, using giant 500-kilogram bombs. Fires broke out everywhere. The ports of Kotka and Vyborg suffered heavy damage. Three-quarters of the houses in Hanko, one-half of the houses in Ekenäs, and one-third of the houses in Åbo have been reduced to rubble. According to Soviet prisoners, Soviet aircraft have been using Estonian airfields for two weeks now. (Havas, 22nd)</p>
<p>Helsinki: According to Finnish bulletins, although Soviet military activity has increased, they have not been able to make any progress in the Karelian Isthmus. Two attacks at Taipale failed, resulting in heavy casualties. On Saturday and Sunday of last week, Soviet aircraft operated in many places in Finland, with hundreds of aircraft dropping bombs on the war zone and behind the lines. A certain hospital with clear Red Cross markings was bombed for the second time. According to recent reports, two civilians behind the lines were killed and 23 injured by bombing. Information obtained yesterday from a captured Soviet pilot revealed that the Soviets are currently using air bases in Estonia to carry out air raids on southwestern Finland. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>Moscow: The headquarters of the Leningrad Military District issued a communique stating that there were no major developments on the front line on the 21st. Reconnaissance teams were active on all fronts. At the same time, artillery battles took place in several districts. The Soviet air force conducted reconnaissance flights and engaged enemy aircraft.

<h3>Lenin's Death: 16th Anniversary Commemoration. Soviet Leaders Attend Commemorative Meeting; Pravda Publishes Article Praising the Two Leaders</h3>
<p>Moscow: Today is the 16th anniversary of Lenin's death. People here held a commemorative gathering at the Moscow State Theatre. Representatives of the laboring masses gathered together, including Soviet hero Stakhanovite workers, representatives of science and art, and prominent Red Army commanders. They were all there to commemorate Lenin, the leader of the proletarian movement, the Bolshevik Party, and the creator of the Soviet state. Lenin's portrait was hung in the hall, along with various flags. At 6:50 p.m., Stalin, Molotov, Kaganovich, Voroshilov, Kalinin, Andreyev, Mikoyan, Beria, Shvernik, Nikolayev, Bulganin, Shcherbakov, and Dimitrov Budyonny, and others arrived at the scene. Everyone stood up and applauded enthusiastically to welcome Stalin, the great successor of Lenin, and his comrades. Kalinin, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, delivered the opening speech. Under Kalinin's leadership, everyone stood up again to pay tribute to Lenin. The band then played music, and Shcherbakov, Secretary of the Moscow City and District Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, delivered a speech. (TASS, 21st)</p>
<p>Moscow: Pravda recently published an article praising Lenin's life, saying, "Lenin dedicated his life to serving the working class. His spirit is as immortal as the laboring humanity. The goal of Lenin's lifelong struggle was the complete victory of Communism in the Soviet Union and throughout the world. This victory is as immortal as Lenin himself. Lenin was born during the successful period of Soviet socialist innovation. This great success was achieved under the guidance of Lenin's great successor, Stalin. Lenin was born during a period of great change in our motherland. In a short period of time, we have transformed ourselves from a backward country into a great socialist power. The Soviet people are now united and enjoying a happy life, and have achieved victories in the icy Arctic, in Finnish factories and laboratories, and in the arid Fuhana region under the scorching sun. Under the great and wise leadership of Stalin, the Soviet Union has repeatedly won victories. Stalin is the Lenin of the present. The irreconcilable contradictions have torn apart the capitalist world. The remnants of the Versailles Treaty system and the corruption of the Polish landlords, which were exposed by Lenin, have now collapsed. The great Soviet people, following Lenin's last instructions, have liberated 13 million people in western Ukraine and western Belarus from the shackles of the landlords, and are assisting the Finnish people in fighting against Mannerheim and the followers of Tanner. The ranks of the Soviet Red Army are gloriously fighting the most vicious enemies of the working people. Alas, the madmen who are reversing the course of history will surely be drowned by the angry tide of the masses. The teachings of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin are so powerful because of their accuracy." (TASS, 21st)</p>

<h3>Pope Issues Statement Saying: Mediation for Peace; The Time is Not Yet Ripe. Cooperation Between the U.S. Government and the Vatican Can Strengthen Hopes for Peace</h3>
<p>London: Pope Pius XII yesterday gave an important interview to Mr. Plaice, a special correspondent of the Daily Mail at the Vatican. He explained the attitude of the Holy See toward mediation for peace. The content of the interview has just been disclosed by the newspaper. The gist is as follows: He is deeply saddened by the devastation of life in Poland and Finland, and the daily tragedies at sea. Once the appropriate time comes, he will conduct mediation work based on a just peace. But at present, only preliminary efforts can be made to move people's hearts in a certain direction, so as to achieve a lasting solution. In the past, during the peace negotiations in 191, the Allied countries failed to adopt the advice of the Holy See, which led to a great mistake. It is hoped that those who are responsible for peace in the future will not repeat the same mistake. Recently, U.S. President Roosevelt sent a personal representative to the Holy See to establish a basis for cooperation between the U.S. government and the Holy See. This move undoubtedly strengthens the hope for mediation for peace. However, given the current situation, mediation for peace is still not possible. When the opportunity ripens in the future, I will certainly come forward and make efforts. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<h3>French Film Star Sentenced to Imprisonment</h3>
<p>Beijing: The French Third Military Tribunal today announced that it has sentenced the famous French film actor Cohn to ten years in prison. His crime was engaging in treasonous activities in August of last year. According to peacetime law, he was sentenced to ten years in prison. If judged according to the law after the outbreak of war, he should have been sentenced to death. (Haitong, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Prominent American Christians Issue Declaration: Expressing Deep Sympathy to England, France, and China</h3>
<p>New York: Thirty-three American Christian pastors and celebrities, including Episcopal Bishop DeGarle and Yale University President Dr. Seymour, recently issued a joint declaration stating that Christians can no longer remain neutral in the current international wars. "Because if England and France win in Europe, or China wins in the Far East, justice and peace will surely be established as a result. Conversely, if Germany, the Soviet Union, or Japan win, justice, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, international cooperation, and the basic principles on which Christianity is based will surely come to an end. Therefore, neutral Christians cannot remain indifferent to such possible outcomes, and should express sympathy and provide assistance to England, France, and China, so as to meet the expectations of those countries." (Havas, 22nd)</p>
<h3>British Inspection of American Mail: New York Times Comments</h3>
<p>Washington: James, the general manager of the New York Times, published an article on the British inspection of American mail, saying that if Washington and London do not act with extreme caution, a large-scale dispute is about to be created. During the last World War, a dispute arose over the British imposition of a contraband blockade against Germany. Now, there is a possibility that diplomatic differences may follow the same path. The inspection of American mail on the high seas will naturally cause friction. If the inspection continues, the friction will become even greater. At the beginning of this war, 80 percent of the American people's feelings were inclined toward the Allied countries. This is a valuable asset that should not be damaged by the inspection of American mail. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<h3>After Gao Zongwu and Others Published Documents, the Chinese Side Further Strengthened Its Resolve to Resist Japan; Gao and Tao's Letter to the Government Has Arrived; Chiang Decides to Ignore Wang's Telegram</h3>
<p>Chongqing – The official reaction here to the publication of various terms of the agreement signed between Jingwei and the Japanese side is that China's determination to resist Japan has become even stronger, and all possibilities for peace negotiations have been completely eliminated. Tonight, a certain government spokesperson stated that the Chinese side is not surprised by the harsh conditions proposed by Japan, as these conditions represent the basic policy previously followed by the Japanese army. The spokesperson said that the letters from Gao and Tao to the government arrived here yesterday, including documents exchanged between the Japanese authorities and Wang, and photographic copies of the agreement signed on December 30. It is said that the draft of this agreement was given to Wang by former Japanese Minister of the Army Itagaki in November last year. Wang immediately handed the draft to Gao Zongwu for detailed study. Gao then made photographic copies of it. Gao and Tao tried their best to oppose it without success. Wang finally signed the agreement on December 30. Regarding the two amended clauses in the aforementioned draft agreement, the government has ignored Wang's telegram. (Reuters dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<p>Chongqing – The government here has already received the telegrams sent by Gao Zongwu and Tao Xisheng last night, as well as the photographic negatives of the treaty concluded between Wang and the Japanese. People here are extremely indignant after seeing these conditions. Furthermore, Chiang Kai-shek has decided to ignore the telegram sent by Wang to Chairman Chiang on the 16th of this month. (United Press dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<p>Chongqing – According to a Chinese spokesperson today, the original text of the secret agreement signed between Jingwei and the Japanese side is in Japanese. Currently, Chairman Chiang is studying this agreement. When reporters asked what kind of reaction would occur on the Chinese side after the exposure of this secret agreement, the spokesperson said, "It is sufficient to strengthen the Chinese government's will to continue resisting Japan," and said that the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs is currently considering countermeasures. (United Press dispatch from the 22nd)</p>

<p>Annex 1: Principles for Adjusting the New Relationship between Japan and China: Japan, China, and Manchuria, under the ideal of constructing a new order in East Asia, will unite in mutual good neighborliness, with the common goal of being the axis of East Asian peace. The basic matters are listed as follows: (1) Establishing general principles for cooperation among Japan, China, and Manchuria, especially good neighborliness, friendship, joint anti-communism, and economic cooperation, based on reciprocity.

<p>Annex 2: Key Points for Adjusting the New Relationship between Japan and China: First, matters concerning post-war affairs and the future: Japan, China, and Manchuria, in order to respect each other's inherent characteristics, unite harmoniously, ensure peace in East Asia, and put good neighborliness and friendship into practice, should comprehensively seek means of mutual assistance, interconnection, and friendship promotion. (1) China recognizes the Empire of Manchuria; Japan and Manchuria respect China's territory and sovereignty. Japan, China, and Manchuria restore new national relations. (2) Japan, China, and Manchuria prohibit all measures and causes that could undermine mutual friendship in politics and propaganda, etc., and will prohibit them in the future. (3) Japan, China, and Manchuria will implement diplomacy based on mutual cooperation. In relations with third countries, they will not take any measures that violate this principle. (4) Japan, China, and Manchuria will cooperate in the integration, creation, and development of culture. (5) Japan will dispatch necessary advisors to be stationed in the central government to cooperate in refreshing construction, and advisors and staff will be assigned to institutions established especially in areas of strong combination. (6) As the concrete realization of good neighborly relations between Japan, China, and Manchuria progresses, Japan will gradually consider the return of concessions and extraterritorial rights, etc.</p>
<p>Second, matters concerning the principle of joint defense: Japan, China, and Manchuria will cooperate in joint anti-communism and make common efforts to maintain it. (1) Japan, China, and Manchuria will each eliminate communist elements and their organizations within their territories, and cooperate on matters related to anti-communist intelligence and propaganda. (2) For the purpose of implementing anti-communism, Japan will station necessary troops in key areas of North China and Inner Mongolia. (3) A Japan-China Anti-Communist Military Alliance will be concluded separately. (4) Troops other than those in item (2) will be withdrawn as quickly as possible depending on the circumstances, whether total or partial, but the troops currently stationed in North China and the lower reaches of the Yangtze River will continue to be stationed until security is established. (5) For the purpose of jointly maintaining security, it is recognized that Japanese warships and units may be stationed and anchored at specific locations along the Yangtze River and on specific islands in South China. (6) In principle, Japan reserves its military requisition rights and supervisory rights over railways, aviation, communications, and major ports and waterways within the areas where troops are stationed. (7) The deployment of armed groups such as police forces and troops of the Chinese side in the Japanese-stationed areas, and military facilities, will be temporarily limited to the minimum necessary for security and national defense. Japan will cooperate in the construction of Chinese troops and police forces through the dispatch of advisors and instructors, the supply of weapons, etc.</p>
<p>Third, matters concerning the principle of economic cooperation: Japan, China, and Manchuria, for the purpose of mutual assistance, interconnection, and the implementation of joint defense, will focus on industries and economies, etc., based on the principle of complementing each other's strengths and weaknesses and exchanging what they have and have not, with mutual benefit as the main objective. (1) Japan, China, and Manchuria will conclude necessary agreements regarding resource development, tariffs, trade, aviation, transportation, communications, meteorology, surveying, etc., in order to realize the above-mentioned objectives and the key points of the following items. (2) Regarding the resources of North China and Inner Mongolia, especially the development and utilization of buried resources, China should provide Japan with special convenience from the perspective of joint defense and economic integration. In other areas, necessary convenience should also be provided for the development and utilization of specific resources from the perspective of economic integration. (3) Japan will provide the Chinese side with necessary assistance for general industries, and regarding agriculture, will assist in its improvement and devise ways to increase production in order to stabilize the livelihood of the Chinese people. (4) Japan will provide necessary assistance in establishing Chinese financial and economic policies. (5) Regarding trade, appropriate tariff and customs systems, etc., will be adopted to promote general trade between Japan, China, and Manchuria. At the same time, the supply and demand of goods between Japan, China, and Manchuria, especially between North China, should be facilitated and made reasonable. (6) Japan will provide necessary assistance for the development of transportation, communications, meteorology, and surveying in China, and will even cooperate in the development of aviation throughout China. Railways in North China (including the Longhai Railway), major maritime transport between Japan and China and along the Chinese coast, water transport on the Yangtze River, and communications between North China and the lower reaches of the Yangtze River should be important for Japan-China transportation cooperation. (7) Japan and China will cooperate in building a new Shanghai.</p>
<p>Remarks: (1) The new central government will compensate for the losses of rights and interests suffered by Japanese nationals in China since the Incident. (2) Before the restoration of new national relations between Japan and China, the new central government should closely consult with the Japanese side on important matters related to Japan.</p>
<p>Annex to the Outline for Adjusting the New Relationship between Japan and China: First, key points for adjusting relations with the Provisional Government: (1) North China, as referred to in these key points, generally refers to Hebei Province, Shanxi Province, Shandong Province south of the Great Wall line (not included), and Henan Province generally north of the old Yellow River. (2) In view of the special nature of North China as a zone of strong combination with Japan and Manchuria for national defense and economic purposes, a North China Political Affairs Commission (tentatively named, hereinafter the same) will be established for the local handling of matters related to Japan and Manchuria based on the principles of adjusting the new relationship between Japan and China. (3) Specific matters regarding the authority and composition of the North China Political Affairs Commission should be discussed at the Central Political Conference. However, before the establishment of the central government, they will be decided by Wang and Wang. (4) The authority and composition of the North China Political Affairs Commission will be limited to what is necessary to concretely realize the following items at the time of the normalization of the new relationship between Japan and China, but even before that, the goal should be to achieve the right limit and gradually organize it. Abolish the name of the Provisional Government and temporarily inherit the established facts from the North China Political Affairs Commission in order to ensure the smooth operation of political affairs and avoid causing anxiety among the people.

(4) The United Reserve Bank system and related systems will be given necessary assistance by the central government for the period during which they need to continue to exist. (5) Temporary plans for major matters between the North China Political Affairs Commission and the central government. (1) The North China Political Affairs Commission will take measures to secure the necessary revenue to pay for its required expenses. For this reason, although customs duties, salt taxes, and consolidated taxes are in principle central taxes, a certain percentage of the surplus customs revenue, and the surplus salt tax revenue and consolidated tax revenue, will temporarily belong to the North China Political Affairs Commission. Furthermore, the central government will entrust the supervision of the aforementioned national tax micro-tax agencies to the North China Political Affairs Commission. (2) The North China Political Affairs Commission may have the right to issue bonds to some extent. (3) The existing property will remain with the North China Political Affairs Commission and will be gradually adjusted. (4) Customs, postal services, and aviation should be placed under the management of the central government. However, changes to the current situation will be implemented gradually. (5) The management and operation of the Longhai Railway will belong to the North China Political Affairs Commission. (6) The personnel power of subordinate officials, excluding specially appointed officials, will belong to the North China Political Affairs Commission. (7) Diplomatic negotiations with third countries will be conducted by the central government. Negotiations with Japan and Manchuria arising from local handling will be conducted by the North China Political Affairs Commission.</p>
<p>Second, key points for adjusting relations with the Reformed Government: (1) Respect the position of the Reformed Government and prevent its wavering. Similarly, encourage its integration and unification with the central government, so that it can continue to handle political affairs with peace of mind before the establishment of the central government. (2) Even after the establishment of the central government, the Reformed Government should be made to understand that political affairs commissions, etc., will not be established. However, Wang should consider the major figures and status involved. (3) When the central government is established and the Reformed Government is dissolved, the central government will temporarily inherit the established facts in order to ensure the smooth transfer of political affairs and avoid causing anxiety among the people. (4) In the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, in order to realize the strong economic combination of China and Japan, Japan's special requests are as follows: (1) Cooperation matters regarding the construction of a new Shanghai. (2) Handling matters arising from the stationing of Japanese troops in the new Shanghai. (3) Cooperation matters regarding aviation, major maritime transport, Yangtze River water transport, and communications in the new Shanghai. (4) Matters concerning other general Japan-China cooperation handled in the new Shanghai. (2) In order to easily realize the above-mentioned requests from the Japanese side, seek necessary measures such as establishing a Japan-China economic consultation mechanism.</p>
<p>Third, key points for adjusting relations with the Mongolian Government: (1) Inner Mongolia, as referred to in these key points, generally refers to the area north of the Great Wall line (included). (2) In view of the special nature of Inner Mongolia as a zone of strong combination between Japan, China, and Manchuria for national defense and economic purposes, with regard to administration, legislation, justice, military affairs, and negotiations with Outer Mongolia other than diplomacy (excluding negotiations with Japan and Manchuria), it is recognized that it has broad autonomy as a highly anti-communist autonomous region based on established facts. (3) In order to establish the relationship between the Mongolian United Autonomous Government and the new central government, before the convening of the Central Political Conference, Wang Jingwei or his representative and Prince De or his representative will agree in writing to the following matters in a meeting: First, the Chinese government recognizes the established fact of the Mongolian United Autonomous Government's high degree of anti-communist autonomy. Second, regarding the adjustment of relations between the two regimes, an agreement will be made separately after the establishment of the new central government based on this understanding. (4) When the aforementioned understanding is established, the Mongolian United Autonomous Government will send representatives to attend the Central Political Conference. (5) The Central Political Conference will not discuss matters outside the scope of the understanding in item (3).</p>
<p>Fourth, Amoy: Wang recognizes the fact that Amoy is a special administrative region.</p>
<p>Fifth, specific islands along the South China coast: The Chinese government will establish administrative organizations (including military handling agencies) directly under the central government in Hainan and other specific islands along the South China coast, with special status, to handle the following required matters: (1) Matters concerning those arising from the stationing of Japanese troops. (2) Matters concerning Japan-China military and security cooperation. (3) Matters concerning the development and utilization of specific resources necessary for defense. (4) Matters concerning aviation communications and maritime patrol.</p>
<p>Remarks: (1) These key points include matters requested by both parties to be agreed upon between Japan and China in the future, as well as matters of China's internal affairs that should be handled automatically. (Dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<p>In late August of last year, Wang submitted a document to the Japanese side titled "What Is Urgently Hoped for from the Japanese Side Before the Establishment of the New Government," containing six articles. A reply from the Japanese side in mid-October contained five articles. The full texts are recorded and translated below.</p>
<p>What Is Urgently Hoped for from the Japanese Side Before the Establishment of the New Government (Wang's document from late August, delivered by Zhou Fohai to Zongwu to take with him, noted by Zongwu): The Japanese side has previously provided a written reply regarding the implementation of the principle of respecting Chinese sovereignty, as desired by the Chinese side. The Japanese side has fully understood the aims of the Chinese side's proposals and is committed to making efforts to realize them. Now that the establishment of the central government is imminent, the Chinese side believes that the following items are necessary conditions for the establishment of the central government, and their implementation does not hinder the Japanese side's regional or timely considerations. It is hoped that the Japanese side will agree: (1) Since the Anglo-Japanese Customs Agreement of last September, customs duties have been deposited in the Yokohama Specie Bank. As of now, there are more than 180 million yuan in Jianghai Customs alone. The Chongqing government has already repaid the foreign debt and indemnity portions as of January 31 of this year. Therefore, please return the foreign debt and indemnity funds, as well as the customs surplus, from before January of this year to the central government. However, legal procedures must wait until the central government is established before they can be officially repaid. It is proposed that the Japanese side agree to two points: (1) Before the establishment of the central government, please order the Yokohama Specie Bank to first lend the government 40 million yuan from the customs deposit in the form of a loan, which will be transferred and repaid after the government is established. (2) After all customs deposits in the Yokohama Specie Bank are returned, the monthly customs revenue will also be transferred to the central government's treasury, but a portion may be deposited in the Yokohama Specie Bank, and the remainder deposited in Chinese merchant banks designated by the central government. (2) The Consolidated Tax Bureau of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces is currently an independent organization that does not belong to the Reformed Government. The monthly tax revenue is handed over to Japanese special agencies, which then hand over a portion to the Reformed Government. It should be agreed upon with the Japanese side that the Ministry of Finance should take over when the central government is established, and the tax revenue should be transferred to the national treasury. (3) Salt tax is a major source of revenue for our country, but currently there is no revenue. The so-called Zuo Company in Central China is a Japanese-run salt transportation and sales organization that pays almost no taxes. Before the establishment of the central government, it should be agreed upon with the Japanese side that after the establishment of the central government, the salt tax, tax administration, and tax payment methods should all be restored to the situation before the Incident. The above three points concern finance. If they are not handled, the central government cannot be established. (4) Please agree that within two months after the establishment of the central government, the Yangtze River from Shanghai to Nanjing will be opened. The negotiations will be presided over by the central government. As for preventing guerrillas from transporting weapons, strict measures can be taken along the coast. After the establishment of the central government, it must obtain de facto recognition from Britain, France, and the United States. If the Yangtze River is not opened, this point will be difficult to achieve. (5) The travel permits along the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway should be issued by the central government. (6) The inspection of Nanjing Station and the city gates should be carried out by Chinese military police. When Japanese military police arrest people in the city, please do so in conjunction with Chinese military police. Although the above two points seem like minor matters, they are of great importance in changing the people's perceptions and improving their psychology. However, this point must be thoroughly understood by the Japanese military authorities stationed in Nanjing in order to be effectively implemented. It should be noted by the Japanese side for handling.</p>
<p>Japanese Reply (Delivered in mid-October, noted by Zongwu): Summary of Our Reply Regarding the Chinese Side's Desires: (1) Regarding Customs Revenue: (1) Loans before the establishment of the central government: The Yokohama Specie Bank's Shanghai branch has the customs revenue of the Shanghai Customs in its deposits. Regarding the use of 40 million yuan from these deposits in the form of a loan before the establishment of the new central government, if the principles for formally adjusting the new national relations between Japan and China after the future establishment of the new central government, that is, the principles for adjusting relations with the Japanese government, and other transitional measures, can be fulfilled, then there are preparations to devise ways to meet your wishes. (2) Handling of Customs Duties After the Establishment of the New Central Government: Regarding the customs system and customs revenue after the establishment of the new central government, in principle, they should be under the unified management of the central government. However, the customs revenue of North China and Inner Mongolia, excluding the portion guaranteed by foreign debt, should belong to North China and Inner Mongolia. Furthermore, customs revenue should temporarily continue to be entrusted to the Yokohama Specie Bank. (2) Regarding the Consolidated Tax: After the establishment of the new central government, the consolidated tax of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces will be taken over by the Ministry of Finance of the central government, and the tax revenue will be transferred to the national treasury, etc., and there are no objections to gradually adjusting them. (3) Regarding the Salt Tax: After the establishment of the new central government, the salt administration and salt tax powder tax methods outside of North China and Inner Mongolia will be gradually handled in order to restore the situation before the Incident, and there are no objections. (4) Regarding the opening of the Yangtze River: The Japanese side also most hopes that the necessity of the Japanese army's combat operations in the Yangtze River basin will be eased, and that the situation in which the entire or at least a part of the Yangtze River region can be opened will arrive soon. However, under the current circumstances, it is still difficult to clearly determine the timing. (5) Regarding the issuance of travel permits for the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway and the inspection of the capital station, etc., there are no objections in principle in view of the aim of respecting the authority of the new central government. However, regarding the actual adjustment, it is hoped that it will be adapted to the actual conditions of the local security situation, etc., and discussed between the relevant Chinese and Japanese government agencies.

<h3>The US-Japan Commercial Treaty Is Nearing Its Expiration Date; The US Ambassador Leaves Shanghai for Hankou; Boards the Luzon Vessel Yesterday Morning to Go Upstream; The Significance of This Trip Is to Conduct On-the-Ground Investigation</h3>
<p>US Ambassador to China, , accompanied by Rear Admiral Glassford, Private Secretary La Fong, Naval Attaché Major Offley, Attaché Meyer, Army Attaché Major McCash, and others, boarded the US Yangtze River Patrol Commander vessel, the Luzon, yesterday morning amidst light snowfall, and left Shanghai to go upstream. The US vessel Wake followed to provide protection.</p>
<p>Ambassador Says He Has No Specific Purpose</p>
<p>Since the Chinese army withdrew from the banks of the Yangtze River in 1938 and the area came under Japanese control, the US Ambassador is the first ambassador to go to Hankou. Yesterday morning, officials from the embassy and Colonel Baker, commander of the US Fourth Naval Fleet, went to see him off. According to the ambassador before his departure, this inspection of the Yangtze River is a routine trip.</p>
<p>Diplomatic Circles Believe the Inspection Is Significant</p>
<p>However, diplomatic circles in this city say that this trip by the ambassador is definitely an inspection. Why not open all the way to Hankou? It is said that the ambassador is also studying the situation in which the interests of third countries have been deprived entirely after the Yangtze River was sealed off by the Japanese under the pretext of military necessity. The ambassador will return to this city from Hankou and, based on what he has learned, will be responsible for deciding everything on behalf of the governments of various countries.</p>
<p>Xun and Wu Ports Must Also Be Investigated</p>
<p>According to another report, the ambassador will also study and consider the issue of the Japanese side allowing third countries to navigate the Yangtze River. Moreover, the ambassador and his party will also conduct a detailed investigation of the situation of the American commercial interests in important ports along the Yangtze River, such as Wuhu and Jiujiang. This is also one of the main reasons. The trip is expected to take a week to reach Hankou.</p>
<p>Returns to Shanghai on the Original Vessel After Staying in Hankou for Three Days</p>
<p>He will stay in Hankou for three days, meet with the US Consul General in Hankou, listen to his report, and have brief contact with major American businessmen. It is scheduled to return south on the original vessel Luzon on February 2, and will be protected by the Guam vessel. It is expected to arrive here on February 6.</p>
<p>Flies to Hong Kong Next Month and Then to Chongqing</p>
<p>After a short stay in Shanghai, he will then travel to Hong Kong with Secretary La Fong and fly to Chongqing. As for the Guam vessel that came with him, since the Wake vessel is already stationed in Hankou, it will temporarily dock at Naval Buoy No. 11 in Shanghai to replace the Wake vessel's absence from Shanghai. As the US-Japan Commercial Treaty is about to expire on the 26th of this month, people generally attach great importance to the ambassador's trip to Hankou.</p>
<h3>Ashes of Japanese Naval Officers and Soldiers Transported Back</h3>
<p>The English-language *Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury* reports that the Japanese-language newspapers here say that the Nishi Honganji Temple on Wuchang Road will hold a memorial service at 3 pm on the 22nd for 20 Japanese naval officers and soldiers who were injured or died of illness in Central China. Their urns of ashes will be transported back to Japan at 10 am on the 23rd.</p>
<h3>Laundry Industry Increases Prices Due to Coal Prices</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Laundry Industry Association recently increased prices due to the sharp rise in coal prices, which have reached 100 yuan per ton. At the same time, the prices of laundry materials have also continued to rise several times to more than ten times. As a result, for the past few months, the costs for the industry have been huge, and all businesses have been operating at a significant loss. If this continues, it will be difficult to continue to operate. Reluctantly, the entire body held a general meeting and decided to slightly increase all laundry costs from February 1 in order to maintain capital. The newly revised laundry prices are listed below. Tablecloths, waiter uniforms, and chair covers from hotels, Western restaurants, and restaurants: general laundry cost is 6 cents per piece. General clothing for customers: large items are 22 cents per piece, medium items are 15 cents per piece. Ship uniforms for large ships: due to the inconvenience of transportation and higher freight costs, the general laundry cost is 15 to 25 cents per piece.</p>
<h3>Qingdao American Chamber of Commerce Doubts Reopening of Yangtze River, Similar to Opening Qingdao Docks, Resulting in Priority Use by Japanese Ships; American Chamber of Commerce Has Telegraphed Hull to Pay Attention</h3>
<p>The English-language "Great American Evening Post" reports, according to visitors from Qingdao, that the Qingdao American Chamber of Commerce has telegraphed U.S. Secretary of State Hull, stating that the United States should exercise extreme caution when considering accepting the proposal to reopen a portion of the Yangtze River.  The partial reopening of the Yangtze River may only be a facade, similar to the partial opening of Qingdao's docks for third-country shipping. This situation is vastly different from what the American Chamber of Commerce desires. From March 25th to December 31st of last year, a total of 116 ships were able to use the designated Pier No. 1 for general cargo and Pier No. 4 for dangerous goods.  During the same period, 152 ships were forced to anchor at unsuitable docks to load and unload cargo and passengers. These docks were never used before the Japanese occupied Qingdao in 1938.  Furthermore, all but two of the Japanese ships entering Qingdao Port during the same period immediately anchored at the four piers used by foreign ships. The two piers designated for foreign ships were also gradually used by Japanese ships. By September, no foreign ships were using them.  The Japanese authorities often use various monopolies to grant Japanese ships priority rights and employ a licensing system to control the export of local goods. As a result, foreign ships can only carry goods that Japanese ships do not want to or are not suitable to carry.</p>
<h3>Cold Weather Reduces Illnesses, Satisfactory Sanitary Conditions, but Extremely Polluted Conditions in Western Shanghai</h3>
<p>The sanitary conditions in the city last month can be described as peaceful, judging from the various infectious diseases recorded by the Public Works Department's Health Office. The detection of pulmonary diseases was not much different from the previous month. However, acute illnesses were sharply reduced. Other diseases such as meningitis, smallpox, and measles were almost eradicated. Although typhoid fever was still prevalent, it had slightly decreased. The two isolation hospitals for Chinese people were not as busy last month as in previous months. The total number of patients admitted was only 152. However, it is impossible to predict how long this satisfactory situation will continue.</p>
<p>Number of Deaths from Diseases</p>
<p>The number of recorded Chinese deaths was 2,730, including 1,607 exposed corpses. The main causes of death were tuberculosis, typhoid fever, and heart disease. Forty-five people suffering from rabies sought treatment from the Health Office. The New Gate Road branch of the Chinese Isolation Hospital admitted 91 patients, followed by inflammation of the stomach and intestines, typhoid fever, meningitis, scarlet fever, and dysentery. The Public Works Department Hospital admitted 61 patients, followed by inflammation of the stomach and intestines, measles, scarlet fever, and malaria. The medical affairs in the schools established by the Public Works Department continued as usual. Only 31 pigs were imported from other ports and landed on the Bund last month, less than one-third of the previous month. A total of 72,710 citizens were vaccinated by the Health Office, and 4,546 were injected with preventive medicine.</p>
<p>Conditions in Western Shanghai</p>
<p>Due to industrial development, the shanty towns in the area outside the Western Shanghai boundary and the surrounding rivers are extremely polluted. Moreover, the drainage ditches are blocked, causing the sanitary conditions there to gradually deteriorate. There are currently 28 refugee camps within the boundary, housing a total of 32,978 refugees. Small-scale refugee camps are still being merged. Few infectious diseases have been found in the refugee camps. A total of 1,760 corpses were cremated, and 853 coffins were buried.</p>
<h3>Shanghai City United Relief Association's Methods for Distributing Clothing and Rice</h3>
<p>The Shanghai City United Relief Association of the First Special District of Shanghai has formulated the following methods for distributing clothing and rice to impoverished people on the streets: (1) The distribution of clothing and rice to impoverished people on the streets by the Association shall be in accordance with these methods. (2) The Association has tentatively set a target of distributing 5,000 sets of cotton clothing and 500 bags of white rice this year. (3) The Association, in accordance with the above targets, has specifically printed 5,000 clothing distribution tickets (one set per ticket) and 50,000 rice distribution tickets (one catty per ticket) and is seeking donations from all sectors. (4) The distribution of clothing and rice shall be based on the principle of distribution by the donors. Those who declare that they do not wish to distribute the items themselves shall entrust various organizations, groups, or philanthropists to distribute them on their behalf. Whether the donors distribute the items themselves or entrust others to distribute them, the information will be published in newspapers to ensure transparency. (5) Methods for raising funds for the distribution of clothing and rice: 1. Conduct fundraising promotions; 2. Publish announcements in newspapers; 3. Send letters to all sectors for support. (6) The start and end dates for the distribution will be determined separately. (7) Donation location: No. 545, Hua Man Fang, Da Xin Street Intersection, Er Ma Road, at the Association.</p>
<h3>Japanese Side Claims to Force a Crossing of the Qiantang River; Fuyang May See Warfare; Shaoxing, Ningbo, Taizhou, and Wenzhou Telegraph Peace; Japanese Side Claims No Knowledge</h3>
<p>Since the Japanese Dommei News Agency telegraphed that the Zhejiang East troops would attack the south bank of the Qiantang River at 6 PM on the 21st and would forcibly cross the Qiantang River on the morning of the 22nd, the New Voice News Agency reporter specifically inquired with the relevant fellow-provincial organizations in Zhejiang East yesterday, such as the Shaoxing Seven Counties, Ningbo, Taizhou, and Wenzhou Fellow-Provincial Associations, as well as various shipping companies, but did not receive any information about the above-mentioned warfare. As for the coastal areas of Ningbo, Taizhou, and Wenzhou, they all telegraphed yesterday that they were peaceful as usual. However, according to observations from those familiar with the situation in Zhejiang East, it is feared that the warfare is in the Fuyang area above Hangzhou. Heavy troops are stationed in that area and the defenses are strict. The Japanese army has repeatedly invaded but has been repelled. If the Japanese army wants to cross the Qiantang River, it will definitely not be easy.</p>
<h3>Second Batch of Group Rice Orders at 1,000 Tons, Already Telegraphed to Saigon to Order, Expected to Arrive in Shanghai in Early February, Central District Rice Sales Are Not Crowded</h3>
<p>The Shanghai People's Food Adjustment Association, in order to regulate the food supply for the citizens of Shanghai, is organizing group purchases of foreign rice. All groups, organizations, companies, and firms can apply to the Association to register and entrust it to order foreign rice to be shipped to Shanghai for regulation. After the first batch of 600 tons (6,000 bags) arrived in Shanghai, the Jin Cheng Bank was entrusted with the funds to expedite the customs clearance procedures. The second batch of purchases has been decided to be 1,000 tons (10,000 bags). After being approved by the Standing Council, the Purchasing Committee checked the market price and shipping costs of foreign rice yesterday and telegraphed to Saigon to order. The foreign exchange will be settled at any time, and the ordering parties will be notified again. It is heard that the rice ordered is Saigon No. 2 and is expected to arrive in Shanghai in early February.</p>
<p>Continuing Rice Sales to Benefit the People</p>
<p>After the Rice Sales Committee entrusted the Rice Trade Association to handle the rice sales, a total of 50 rice sales locations were established in the two concessions. Each location was stipulated to sell 50 bags of rice. The day before yesterday was the first day. Except for locations 12, 13, 18, 19, 26, 28, 30, 40, and 48 in the Central District, which did not sell out, the remaining locations continued rice sales yesterday. Except for the temporary suspension of rice distribution, each location continued to distribute 50 bags to handle rice sales. In the northwestern districts, impoverished people carried cloth bags, pots, lead tubes, and other rice containers, standing in front of the rice shops, queuing up to buy discounted rice. They were still crowded, but fortunately, the police officers dispatched by the police station did their best to maintain order, so no unfortunate incidents occurred.</p>
<p>Actively Fundraising to Prepare for the Long Term</p>
<p>The Rice Sales Committee purchased 20,0618 bags of broken rice from the Shanghai market, scheduled to be sold out from the 8th to the 10th. Of the 15,000 bags ordered from Saigon, 3,000 bags had already arrived in Shanghai a few days ago. Yesterday, another 3,000 bags arrived in Shanghai on an Italian ship and were being processed for customs clearance by the British firm Jardine Matheson. It has been telegraphed that the remaining 9,000 bags are scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 15th. It has now been decided to continue handling rice sales and actively solicit donations, striving to make rice sales last longer and be able to continue without interruption. Therefore, it is hoped that people from all walks of life will act out of compassion for those who are hungry and drowning and contribute grain and gold. The receiving agencies are Jin Cheng Bank, Shanghai Bank, Zhong Nan Bank, and Tong Run Zi and two Qian Zhuang banks.</p>
<h3>Zhao Weizu Escapes to Hong Kong, More Than Fifty People Were Detained</h3>
<p>Zhao Weizu, formerly the principal of the Municipal Orphanage Middle School, residing at No. 2, Xin Ma An Li, Lao Da Gu Road, Public Concession, Nanhui County, was suddenly taken away by Public Works Department police officers together with Chinese and Western detectives from the police station on the morning of November 22nd, who rushed to Zhao's residence to search it. Although nothing was found as a result, Zhao Weizu himself was eventually detained. Zhao has always been enthusiastic about charitable undertakings. After this city became an isolated island, seeing that the families of most Boy Scouts had been destroyed by artillery fire, he felt sorry for their homelessness. Therefore, Zhao founded the Orphanage Middle School at No. 11, Shengjia Auditorium, Jisi Feier Road, in the area outside the Shanghai Concession, placing all the Boy Scouts in the Orphanage Middle School to prevent them from suffering the hardship of being displaced. The number of students admitted reached more than 200. In the autumn of last year, the buildings of the Orphanage Middle School were reported in various newspapers one after another. Zhao's resentment towards people may have been caused by this. As for the sudden and wrongful arrest, Zhao did not expect it. Since being detained, it has been more than fifty days. It is heard that he was once taken to the Japanese Headquarters in Hongkou and strictly interrogated many times. Finally, because there was no sufficient incriminating evidence and no crime could be alleged, it was heard that Mr. Zhao was released about a week ago and allowed to regain his freedom. However, very few people knew about Zhao's release. Even Zhao's relatives and friends were unaware. It is understood that Zhao has already bought a ticket to Hong Kong in order to avoid attention from all parties and to recover for a long time, in order to escape from this controversial situation.</p>
<h3>Public Works Department Establishes Industrial Training Class, Specializing in Machine Manufacturing and Safety Training</h3>
<p>Since the Public Works Department's Industrial Section established the Industrial Safety Training Class in 1934, it has been well-received by various factories and enthusiastically participated in by various mechanics and workers because the courses are relevant to the needs and the time is appropriate, without hindering the workers' work. By the end of last year, more than 300 people had graduated from each session. It is learned that the spring session of this year is about to begin. If factories wish to send trainees to receive training, they can first register with the Industrial Section of the Bureau at No. 209 Jiangxi Road, indicating "Registration" on the envelope. The detailed methods are as follows:</p>
<p>The training class is divided into two subjects, taught in the Western District, and no fees are charged.</p>
<p>A. Machine Manufacturing Class. This class specifically trains foremen and mechanics who manufacture machines in machine iron factories, teaching them more than ten subjects such as metal materials, industrial mathematics, machine design, safety, categories, installation, transmission, telegraph pole method, and machine drawing.</p>
<p>B. Metal Stamping Product Manufacturing Class. This class is specifically designed for factory owners and foremen of factories that manufacture metal such as hardware, cans, and lamps with machine presses. The Industrial Section, in view of the fact that workers in this type of factory often have their fingers cut off and injured due to carelessness at work, has specifically established this class. In addition to teaching industrial common sense, it also provides particularly detailed explanations on the manufacture of press molds and safety devices, in order to prevent problems before they occur. The dates for teaching and registration are as follows:</p>
<p>A. Machine Manufacturing Class (taught once every Tuesday and Friday), starting date: February 13th, 7:00 PM to 9:00 PM. Trainees must register in person at the following location from 7:00 PM on February 6th. Teaching location: Public Works Department Health Branch at the Great Self-Ming Zhong, Xiao Sha Du Road, quota: 100 people, training period: 14 weeks.</p>
<p>B. Metal Stamping Manufacturing Class (taught once every Monday and Thursday), starting date: February 26th, 7:00 PM to 10:00 PM. Trainees must register in person at the following location from 7:00 PM on February 19th. Teaching location: Public Works Department Health Branch at the Great Self-Ming Zhong, Xiao Sha Du Road, quota: 100 people, training period: approximately five weeks.</p>
<p>Appendix: The lecturers hired for each class are all well-known engineers and university professors in Shanghai, who are responsible for explaining and focusing on practicality, explaining various theories in a simple way, and using slides to project detailed mechanical drawings on the screen. Whether the workers are literate or not, they can understand. Upon graduation, those who pass the examination and do not miss classes will be given a certificate.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Congee Kitchen Sends Personnel to Shanghai to Solicit Donations</h3>
<p>Wuxi, on the Jinghu Line, was originally a county with industry and commerce. Since being invaded and occupied by the Japanese army, the people's livelihood has declined over the past two years, and the number of poor people has increased day by day. At present, there are at least three or four thousand people in the city who are crying out for food. Wang Zhiqing, Jiang Yinghan, and others from Wuxi have collected donations to open a congee factory for more than a month. Now that the funds have been exhausted, Wang and Jiang came to Shanghai the day before yesterday and stayed at the Zhenhua Hotel on Si Ma Road. Yesterday, they solicited donations from fellow villagers in Shanghai, Feng Yunchu, Xue Xuehai, Shun Qin Guan, and others, hoping to jointly do good deeds. Wang and Jiang will stay in Shanghai for about three or four days before returning to Wuxi.</p>
<h3>Expediting the Printing of the Fifth Batch of Fractional Currency Notes, Deciding to Continue Issuing, Shanghai Market Still Has a Strong Demand for Fractional Notes</h3>
<p>In order to remedy the shortage and panic of fractional currency notes in the Shanghai market, the Shanghai Branch of the Central Bank entrusted Yongning Company to print one-cent and five-cent fractional currency notes. The New Voice News Agency reporter learned from the Central Bank yesterday that the issuance of fractional currency notes will be determined according to the needs of the market. Batches 1, 2, 3, and 4 have already been issued, with each batch being 500,000 yuan, for a total of 2 million yuan. However, the market still has a strong demand for fractional currency notes, and there are many applicants from various industries. Therefore, the fifth batch is being expedited for printing. As soon as the four batches are completely issued, the fifth batch will be issued immediately and circulated in the market.</p>

<h3>Boiled Water Industry Asks Authorities to Find Ways to Purchase Kailuan Coal at Parity Prices, Earlier Registered with the Company but Now Completely Rejected, Businesses Closing One After Another, Related to Social Problems</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Boiled Water Industry Association, this time in order not to increase prices again, has aroused deep attention from all walks of life in the city. All agreed-upon measures have been implemented one by one. According to the chairman of the association's committee, Zhang Delong, and vice-chairman Yu Lianfa, speaking to the New Voice News Agency reporter yesterday, the industry has been severely hit by the impact of rising coal prices. Not only is there no profit to be made, but it is operating at a loss. The dire situation can be imagined. However, the industry believes that in order to solve the fundamental problem, the key lies in suppressing coal prices and reducing the burden on the industry.</p>
<p>Dispatching Representatives to Petition Separately</p>
<p>Specifically, at 10:30 AM yesterday, the association appointed the chairman of the committee, Zhang Delong, the vice-chairman of the committee, Yu Lianfa, and the supervisor, Shi Xingli, to petition the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce. The secretary of the association, Yan E'sheng, received them. Mr. Yan expressed deep sympathy for the industry's measures and was willing to find ways to help within the possible scope. From 1:00 PM that afternoon, they respectively went to the Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Public Concession and the Shanghai First Special District Citizens' United Association to continue petitioning. Tao Leqin received them at the Ratepayers' Association, and Zhu Yutao received them at the Citizens' Association. Both Tao and Zhu also agreed to assist. Today, it is planned to continue petitioning prominent figures in the business community, Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Ludeng, and Huang Yanfang, calling for assistance. Excerpts from their petition are recorded below:</p>
<p>Directly Purchasing Coal, Registered Long Ago</p>
<p>Submitting a petition regarding the Kailuan Coal Mine Company's rejection of issuing coal, the industry is in difficulty, requesting assistance to avoid serious social problems. We, the undersigned 310 members of the association, Shi Xingli, Chen Yishan, Qiu Tingsen, and others, jointly state, "After the Shanghai war, the Kailuan Coal Mine Company notified our industry to register for direct coal purchases. At that time, hundreds of businesses in our industry complied and registered, all of which have registration certificates and registration numbers that can be checked. From then on, we directly purchased and sold, eliminating middlemen from profiteering. The intention was very good. Unexpectedly, after the registration, the amount of coal issued gradually decreased, and recently it has been completely rejected, so that our industry cannot purchase the registered coal."</p>
<p>Coal Merchants Monopolize Coal Prices Skyrocketing</p>
<p>It is known that the coal merchants clearly know that the company has refused to sell coal to our industry, so they monopolize and hoard, raising the company's coal price of more than 40 yuan per ton to more than 100 yuan, a shocking and unprecedented increase. Although our industry has slightly increased the price of boiled water to help subsidize it, boiled water is related to the livelihood of ordinary people and has already been attacked by public opinion. Moreover, coal balls are inexpensive, and increasing the price of boiled water is tantamount to killing the goose that lays the golden eggs. Therefore, the industry cannot maintain it, and several businesses are closing every day. If this continues, the entire industry will inevitably close, but there are four serious social problems that will arise as a result: (1) As a result of the closure of boiled water shops or the increase in the price of boiled water, citizens will have to boil their own water. In this isolated island where the population is dense and the houses are like pigeon cages, the coal stoves are burning day and night, which can easily cause fires. (2) Not only is it easy to cause fires if the coal stoves are not extinguished, but the coal gas fumes will increase the number of people suffocating to death due to coal gas poisoning. (3) The working class will inevitably drink raw water, which will harm hygiene and cause diseases. (4) Approximately ten thousand people in the city rely on boiled water shops for their livelihood, and the closure of these businesses will deprive them of their livelihoods. These four major social problems are bound to occur. The root cause is the company's refusal to sell coal to our industry. Our industry needs approximately 3,000 tons of coal per month, which is not a small amount. It is truly incomprehensible that the company refuses to issue coal. We are transferring a letter to the company, still following the previous registration method, selling coal directly to our industry to alleviate the difficulties, and asking for assistance from various powerful groups and society as people, so that we can soon realize our goal. The industry will be fortunate, and the citizens will be fortunate. The members of the association are presenting the above facts and hope your organization will provide assistance, and forward a letter to the Kailuan Coal Mine Company to directly sell coal to our industry at parity prices, which will be deeply appreciated."</p>

<h3>工部局一九三九年份　保障兒童工作（續）</h3>
<p>Efforts to Improve the Contracting System</p>
<p>Female workers in a certain large cotton mill can be divided into three types: first, those who live freely in their own family homes and can come and go as they please; second, those who are housed in factory-provided dormitories; and third, those who are under the control of contractors. The factory owner is clearly aware of the malpractices inherent in the contractor system. Therefore, the number of female workers employed by contractors is strictly limited. Moreover, it is insisted that all female workers under the control of contractors must eat in the factory's canteen, where the food is quite good, with the cost borne by the contractors.</p>
<p>Methods for Handling Juvenile Offenses</p>
<p>In May 1936, the Ministry of Judicial Administration of the National Government issued fifteen special measures for handling juvenile offenses to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. However, these have not yet been implemented. Last [month], the director of the Child Welfare Section discussed special procedures for handling juvenile offenses with the Police Department. The Commissioner of Police agreed in principle but believed that the proposed plan could only be implemented after the affairs of both the courts and the police station gradually returned to normal. Currently, all juvenile offenders are tried by the court as usual, with detailed case information recorded. Last year, there was an average of 383 cases per month involving juvenile offenders under the age of twenty, of whom 267 were prosecuted under the Criminal Code and the Regulations for Punishment of Police Offenses, and the rest were prosecuted under the Bureau's regulations.</p>
<p>All Staff Members Have Specific Responsibilities</p>
<p>Last year, the section had one staff member specializing in social work. Currently, there are four social workers, one of whom is employed by the "Shanghai Local Church." Each of these staff members has specific responsibilities, which are allocated as follows: (1) handling cases transferred by the police station, including abandoned, abducted, abused, or exploited children (male and female); (2) researching and handling cases involving dancers and prostitutes; (3) handling issues related to child beggars and juvenile offenders; (4) studying the problems of workers in childcare facilities and seeking to provide them with supervision to ensure their protection.</p>

<h3>囚糧雜穀殼　傳訊米號主人　被告否認作弊諭再偵訊</h3>
<p>Prison Grain Mixed with Husks: Summons to Rice Shop Owner; Defendant Denies Cheating, Investigation Ordered to Continue</p>
<p>The Prison Grain Procurement Committee of the Shanghai Special District purchases the required prison grain through monthly bidding. On December 29th of last year, the bid was won by Jin Sheng Chang Sui Ji Rice Shop at 247 Mei Bai Ke Road, with a bid to supply 185 dan of brown rice at $32.70 per dan. However, when the rice shop delivered the rice by truck to the Special Second District Prison, the inspecting officer Xie Qingbai thoroughly inspected the rice and discovered that the rice contained as much as one-third of mixed grains and husks. He immediately notified the rice shop to send laborers to the prison to sift through all the brown rice, sifting out as many as twelve bags of rice husks. Xie reported this to Qiao Wanxuan, the Chief Prosecutor of the Third Branch of the High Court, requesting an investigation into the personnel of the Prison Grain Procurement Committee and Pan Jibin (39 years old, local), the owner of Jin Sheng Chang Sui Ji Rice Shop, etc., to deter unlawful fraud. The case has now been sent by the Procuratorate of the Third Branch of the High Court to the Procuratorate of the Special Second Court for handling in accordance with the law. Yesterday afternoon, a warrant was issued to Pan Jibin, the owner of Jin Sheng Chang Sui Ji Rice Shop, to bring his account books to the court, and Xie Qingbai, the inspector of the Special Second Prison, was also summoned to the court. The prosecutor opened an investigation hearing, and according to Xie's statement, the process of discovering the mixed grains in the brown rice for prison grain was described in detail. He also stated that all the prison staff and Zhang Dexian, the head of the kitchen, were fully aware of the matter. Pan Jibin argued that when submitting the bid, he first sent a sample of the rice, which was approved before the bid was won. If there were any mixed grains or husks in the delivered rice, it was not the merchant's fault. After reviewing the statements, the prosecutor ordered a recess for further investigation and scheduled another hearing.</p>

<p>Zhang Bingyan, a runner for the Ren Tai Pig Shop at 116 Da Zhan Road, a native of Jiading, 25 years old, residing at 8, Lane 288, Yunnan Road, was found to have embezzled $2,700 by secretly collecting customer accounts. The shareholder Wang Wentao discovered this and reported it to the Chengdu Road Police Station. Detective Cui Chengke and Constable Ni Runsheng were dispatched to arrest Zhang Bingyan and take him into custody at the police station. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Second Tribunal of the First Special Court. Zhang Tianyin, the police station's lawyer, presented the case and requested permission for detention to continue the investigation. Judge Xiao Peishen briefly questioned Zhang Bingyan and ordered him to be detained for seven days for further investigation and questioning.</p>
<h3>盜案彙誌</h3>
<p>Digest of Theft Cases</p>
<p>Wang A'gen, being unemployed for a long time and unable to make a living, colluded with Yi Zhaofu to obtain a pistol. On October 23rd of last year, at around 4:00 PM, they robbed Kang Yuqing of $97 in national currency at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Xiao Sha Du Road. After the crime, Wang was arrested and sent to the Criminal Court of the First Special Court, where Judge Xiao sentenced Wang A'gen to six years of imprisonment for armed robbery. Wang was dissatisfied and appealed to the Second Branch of the High Court. The case was concluded yesterday morning, and Judge Nie Cheyi changed the original sentence to three years of imprisonment for Wang A'gen.</p>
<p>The robbers Xia Lao Wu and others, who committed armed robbery at night at the Wan Long Tai water pipe shop on Gongguan Road in Jieqiu, were interrogated by Judge [ ] of the Second Special Court. The case was decided yesterday afternoon. Xia Lao Wu, Chen Xiao Long, and Wang Xiao Wu were each sentenced to nine years of imprisonment for being repeat offenders of armed robbery at night. Chen Xiao Er Zi was sentenced to five years of imprisonment. Chen Yanchun, who provided the gun and ammunition used in the robbery, was sentenced to six months of imprisonment. Xue Zhongren was found not guilty. The gun and ammunition were confiscated. After the verdict, the police of the Public Concession stated that Xia, Chen, and five Sun accomplices had committed similar crimes within the concession and requested their transfer for further investigation. The court, after verifying the information, ordered that the four suspects be handed over to the detectives for transportation.</p>
<p>The suspected thieves Wang A'san, Zhang Shixing, Han Fengzhao, and others from Jiangbei, on the 20th at 7:00 PM, conspired to carry a fake pistol at a location near Changping Road on Hart Road, intending to rob pedestrians of their property.

<h3>象牌商標涉訟　原告訴求禁止使用</h3>
<p>Elephant Brand Trademark Dispute: Plaintiff Seeks Injunction</p>
<p>Weng Fuqing, a native of Ningbo, 48 years old, residing at 266 Jiale Road, opened the Tongming Electric Appliance Factory, using the elephant head brand as a trademark for his domestically produced flashlight, which was legally registered with the Trademark Bureau and obtained exclusive rights. Recently, Weng discovered that the Zhengji Machinery Factory at 13 Xinmin Lane, Bai'erbu Road, was imitating his factory's products and also using the elephant head brand as a trademark, which obviously infringed upon his exclusive rights. He hired lawyer Wu Xiangyuan to represent him and filed a complaint with the Civil Tribunal of the Second Special Court, accusing Wang Hongzheng, the owner of the Zhengji Factory, seeking an injunction to prohibit the use of the elephant head brand trademark. Based on the complaint, the court summoned the defendant to court in the Fourth Civil Tribunal yesterday morning, but the defendant did not appear, only submitting a written request to the court to suspend the trial. The court considered this to be legally inappropriate and rejected the request in court, ordering a rescheduling of the hearing.</p>
<h3>和尚賭負服毒</h3>
<p>Monk Gambles Away Fortune and Attempts Suicide by Poison</p>
<p>Dao Cheng, a young monk from Qingliang Temple at 764 Niuzhuang Road, originally from Hubei, 19 years old, became a monk six or seven years ago. Over the years, he had accumulated some savings. Recently, Dao Cheng made friends unwisely, which led him to become addicted to gambling. A few days ago, he went to Caojiadu with friends and gambled all night, losing all his hard-earned money. Yesterday evening at 7:00 PM, he bought poison and returned to the temple to go to bed. Later, his companions noticed that his expression was very strange and that he was bleeding from his mouth. After questioning him in detail, they learned that he had taken poison and sent him to the hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>三成坊房東斷水　房客警告無效</h3>
<p>Landlord of Sanchengfang Cuts Off Water Supply; Tenant's Warning Ineffective</p>
<p>Tenants of Sanchengfang on Meizheke Road, due to their opposition to the separate installation of water meters, which would effectively increase their rent, had their tap water supply cut off by the landlord in an attempt to force their compliance. The tenants issued a warning, setting a deadline of yesterday for the restoration of the water supply, which proved ineffective. The dispute is in danger of escalating.</p>
<h3>昨晨再飛雪花　氣候驟轉寒冽　昨又凍斃數十人</h3>
<p>Snowflakes Fell Again Yesterday Morning; The Weather Turned Bitterly Cold; Dozens More Froze to Death Yesterday</p>
<p>After the snowfall stopped yesterday afternoon, there was no further snowfall last night. The weather turned sharply colder yesterday morning. According to the Observatory's records, the temperature between 5:00 AM and 6:00 AM yesterday morning fell to 0.6 degrees Celsius below freezing, which is 30.09 degrees Fahrenheit. The season has entered its normal, full winter state. The weather in both Hankou and Nanjing continued to snow from yesterday morning. Shanghai's weather is generally controlled by the climate of the Yangtze River basin. Therefore, sparse snowflakes continued to appear in the upper air at 9:00 AM yesterday morning, but they fell intermittently. Moreover, the weather in Qingdao turned from sunny to cloudy yesterday morning, and the weather in Fuzhou changed from mountain rain to cloudy [ ]. Therefore, based on the weather forecasts for nearby areas of Shanghai, it is unlikely that the weather in this area will clear up and become sunny.</p>
<p>Since the weather in this area suddenly turned bitterly cold yesterday, many refugees and beggars sleeping in the open have continued to freeze to death. According to the reporters from Da[ ] News Agency, who inquired at Pushan Villa, yesterday the church found twenty adult corpses and forty-nine child corpses on various roads in the concession. After collecting the bodies, the church's hearse transported them to the International Cemetery on Hongqiao Road for burial. With the advent of midwinter, the poor people sleeping on the streets are in a pitiful state of starvation and cold. It is hoped that all sectors of society will generously donate to enable them to eke out a precarious existence.</p>

The detectives immediately returned fire. The two sides exchanged a total of thirty or forty shots. As a result, one thug was shot down by the detectives, and a pistol was seized. In addition, two unarmed accomplices were also captured on the spot. Only one managed to escape. The detectives reported this to the police station, which dispatched a vehicle to transport them to Gordon Road. After initial questioning, it was learned that the injured thug was Xu Chunfu, 27 years old, who was shot in the chest. He was immediately transferred to the police hospital for treatment. The other two thugs were temporarily detained pending the capture of their accomplice for further investigation.</p>

<h3>浙省戰時文化考查團　考察浙西敎育文化　一切敎育文化工作已逐漸上軌道</h3>
<p>Zhejiang Province Wartime Cultural Survey Team Inspects Western Zhejiang Education and Culture; All Education and Cultural Work is Gradually Getting on Track</p>
<p>(Jinhua Correspondence) The Zhejiang Provincial Wartime Education and Cultural Affairs Committee, in order to fully understand the situation of education and cultural work in the western Zhejiang war zone, and to strengthen the guidance of education and cultural work in western Zhejiang, specially organized the Western Zhejiang Wartime Cultural Survey Team. Participants included inspectors from the committee Cai Ji and Zhu Jimin, as well as representatives from the Political Envoy Office of the [ ] Group Army Headquarters, the Southeast Daily, the China Cultural Construction Association, the Zhejiang Branch, the Provincial Wartime Cultural Organization Federation, the Provincial System Personnel Association, and the Provincial Fine Arts Work Association. Cai Ji was appointed as the head of the team by the [ ], and Liu Zirun, a representative of the Southeast Daily, was mutually elected as the deputy head by the representatives of various participating organizations and groups. The Zhejiang Provincial Department of Education, in order to assist the work of the team, specially ordered the supervisors and inspectors in western Zhejiang to provide assistance nearby. The team departed from Jinhua on November 21st of last year and, after more than forty days, has now completed its mission and returned to Jinhua in succession. The following is a record of the team's inspection process. After leaving Jinhua, the team went to the counties of Yuqian, Xiaofeng, Anji, and Wukang. After arriving at Mogan Mountain, they split into two routes: one route, led by Cai Ji and Liu Zirun, crossed the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway and went deep into the counties of Wuxing, Chongde, and Deqing; the other route, led by Zhu Jimin, Yu Naida, and Pan Changhan, returned to Anji and went to the counties of Changxing, Yuhang, Hangzhou, Lin'an, and Changhua. In all the places they passed, in addition to visiting party and government organs, political and cultural teams, and schools, they also held cultural seminars, exchanging many opinions with education and cultural workers in various counties. According to the person in charge, after the counties in western Zhejiang were ravaged in succession from the 26th year onwards, education and cultural work largely came to a standstill. However, after our military and political forces coordinated to attack and restore political power, everything has gradually gotten back on track. At present, the number of primary schools in the war zone has almost recovered to the pre-war level, and the spirit of those engaged in education and cultural work to persevere through hardships is especially admirable. However, the lack of both cultural work cadres and materials in the war zone is a serious problem. It is heard that the team is currently engaged in整理考察报[missing character]告 and will make work plans based on the actual needs of the western Zhejiang war zone, for the Provincial Education and Culture Association to adopt and implement, in order to seek the development of cultural work in western Zhejiang. In addition, the team collected various anti-Japanese propaganda materials in western Zhejiang, and the team members took and painted more than two hundred pieces of artwork, which will be exhibited by the Provincial Education and Culture Association at the Cultural Work Achievement Exhibition in April, and then compiled for exhibition.</p>
<h3>川敎廳長郭有守　報告敎育（二）</h3>
<p>Guo Youshou, Director of the Sichuan Department of Education, Reports on Education (2)</p>
<p>Vocational Schools</p>
<p>These include the Provincial Chengdu Dyeing and Weaving Vocational School, the Provincial Nanchong Senior [ ] Vocational School, and the Provincial Chengdu工艺 Vocational School, which is being planned. In addition, the New Life Movement Promotion Association held a miscellaneous supplementary school, which was very successful and mostly attended by housewives in the city. It has been changed to the Provincial Chengdu Women's Vocational Supplementary School. The Chongqing Sichuan Ceramics Vocational School was later merged into the Chongqing Senior Industrial Vocational School. Later, due to the relocation of the Senior Industrial School, it was entrusted to a ceramics factory in Jiangjin to run it. It has now been decided to establish the Provincial Jiangjin Ceramics Vocational School. In addition, the Zishu Joint Practical Vocational School is headed by the director of the Neijiang Alcohol Factory, integrating academics and practice. The above is a general overview of the vocational education reorganization last year. The Ministry of Education stipulates that vocational education should account for 35% of the funding for secondary education. In the past, it was far from that. After the reorganization, it is not far from the proportional standard. Next, I will talk about the central work this year. The first is to improve the salaries of primary school teachers, the second is to improve the quality of secondary schools, and the third is to universally establish township central primary schools and national schools. These central tasks were instructed by the President when I went to Chongqing to meet him. Regarding the improvement of primary school teachers, primary school education is the foundation of national education and is of great importance. In the past, primary school teachers in Sichuan had low salaries and poor treatment. Some had monthly incomes of only eight or nine yuan and were sometimes unable to receive their salaries on time. Therefore, changing the treatment of education is a matter of urgency. Therefore, the Department of Education has formulated measures for reorganizing local education funding and improving the treatment of primary school teachers, which have been submitted to the Provincial Affairs Conference for deliberation and decision.</p>

<h3>Grain Wheat Has Been Raised to Nineteen Yuan, Returned Flour Sets New High Price, Street Sales Restrictions for Factory Flour Are Even Stricter</h3>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday, the market price of wheat reached a new peak. According to recent domestic sources, the arrival of goods has been reduced due to being held back by a certain party, and the intention of the sellers to hoard goods is also firm. In addition, speculators want to raise the price of wheat to twenty yuan. Yesterday, five or six truckloads of wheat were traded by the export group, reaching a peak price of nineteen yuan and five jiao, an increase of more than one yuan compared to the previous day. The buying price for factories has also reached nineteen yuan. Specifically, Su Chang wheat was priced at nineteen yuan, Nanjing Zhenjiang wheat at eighteen yuan and nine jiao and a half to eight jiao and four fen, and Taicang wheat at eighteen yuan and seven jiao. Fuxin Factory bought 600 bags, Fufeng Factory bought 1,000 bags, and Japanese factories also purchased more than 1,000 bags, with a selling price of also needing to be nineteen yuan. The wheat market, which has been holding out for many days, has resulted in a shocking increase. Yesterday, 7,000 tons of foreign wheat were traded, at a combined price of twenty-five yuan.</p>
<p>Flour: Yesterday's spot flour market situation, the street wholesale price of No. 2 flour, in order to maintain the people's food supply, has not increased, but the restrictions on supply are even stricter. Customer orders have not been opened for sale, and it has been many days. Once closed, the general demanders can only take back the goods from the returned warehouse receipt. Although the market price has repeatedly increased, they have to drink poison to quench their thirst. Therefore, yesterday the returned goods set a new high price. The Green Artillery Carriage brand rose to eleven yuan and seven jiao and a half, while the Warship brand was less popular and the price was still twelve yuan and four jiao and a half. However, this is a small ticket warehouse receipt, and the whole amount is not far from the selling price of the Artillery Carriage. Under the soaring wheat price, the factories are even more hoarding goods, which is a major disaster for the staple food of the common people.</p>
<h3>Price Stabilization Begins, Rice Sales Are Weak</h3>
<p>The domestic supply of japonica rice is still scarce. Only 500 bags of Qingjiao Bang Bo early rice and 200-300 bags of South Port early and late rice are transferred from Hongkou. However, people are mediocre and the psychology of being a guest is also aware that the market may change, and they are all hesitant to move forward. Those who have goods in hand, with profit to be made, are taking the opportunity to sell back, so the sales market is weak and returned goods are everywhere, so the market price is falling. For example, the new Huowen rice has depreciated by three or four jiao, from the initial opening of thirty-eight yuan to only thirty-seven yuan and six jiao. The rest of the old Saigon and Tokyo Yu Jian have a solid foundation and a wider sales channel, and are still holding the original price. The thick and thin japonica rice is sold firmly due to the lack of arrival of goods. Moreover, it is a seasonal product, and the local shops have a strong appetite. The market has risen by about half a yuan. For example, the Qingsi special thin of the Su Tong Bang Lishang japonica rice is priced at over forty yuan, and the Qingsi special thin is also priced at forty yuan. The central market price is thirty-nine yuan and a half, and the South Port early and late rice is thirty-nine yuan, determined to be thirty-eight yuan and a half. The White Yuan’s in and out are equal, with no change. The situation near noon, due to being slightly affected by foreign rice, the sales market suddenly returned to being dull, so the closing phenomenon has become weak, not as tight as the mid-morning market.</p>
<p>Yesterday, due to the shrinking exchange rate, the price of foreign rice was raised. Saigon Nos. 1 and 2 were difficult to calculate, and the price of broken rice was also increased by four or five jiao, failing to continue trading. However, although the price of foreign rice has been increased by the seller, the shops have a weak appetite, and the wholesalers are also watching. Moreover, at the beginning of price stabilization, the total market transaction was less than 2,000 bags, and the price only increased by two or three jiao. Saigon No. 1 was thirty-nine yuan and three jiao, and Annam japonica rice was thirty-nine yuan and a half, with the middle and second grades priced separately.</p>
<p>Yesterday, foreign rice was shipped again, by Jardine Matheson's Desheng wheel, carrying 3,000 bags from Haiphong and 12,600 bags loaded in Hong Kong, totaling 15,600 bags. The ship arrived yesterday morning and berthed at the Roosevelt Wharf to unload. (砠)</p>
<h3>Financial Gold Market Revives</h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot gold dark market conditions, following the weakening of the exchange market, rebounded. However, the initial opening was still sluggish, opening at four thousand and thirty yuan, a decrease of eleven yuan compared to last weekend. The reason was that the foreign exchange was still loose, followed by the gold shops selling, lowering the price by another two yuan. Later, due to the stabilization of the exchange market, the securities firms first bought in, and at the same time, the money industry had a very good appetite, vigorously absorbing purchases on behalf of the Hong Kong gangs, so the market situation returned to being level, fluctuating around four thousand and forty yuan. Unexpectedly, at noon, the foreign exchange suddenly reported tightening, which boosted the morale of buyers. Securities firms and a certain bank came to buy people, and the price was raised by more than a thousand yuan. Near the close, a certain gold shop came to sell again, and it fell back to four thousand and fifty-one yuan at the close. In the early afternoon, due to the continued slight tightening of the exchange market, the market opened at a high price of four thousand and fifty-nine yuan. However, the securities firms took profits and came out again, and the gold shops sold again, so the result was the same as the noon close, still at four thousand and fifty-one yuan, an increase of ten yuan compared to last Saturday. The overall transaction was still smooth, totaling one thousand two to three hundred taels. Jewelry shops were dull, and customs gold was still level.</p>
<p>Since the morning, each bar (ten taels) initially opened, the market was loose due to the weak exchange rate, and money changers and retail investors had selling sentiment. Therefore, the market was suppressed by eleven yuan at the opening. A certain bank sold 20 taels to the industry at four thousand and thirty yuan. A little later, the gold shop also sold, reducing the price by another two yuan. The gold shop sold 10 taels to the money changer for four thousand and twenty-eight yuan. After that, the foreign exchange was fixed, and a certain securities firm took the opportunity to buy at a low price, and a certain number of money changers also suddenly searched for goods on behalf of customers, and soon rebounded by twelve yuan. A certain securities firm bought 30 taels from the gold shop for four thousand and forty yuan. At that time, another securities firm sold dozens of taels, and once again suppressed the price to four thousand and thirty-seven yuan. Later, the foreign exchange suddenly reported tightening, arousing people's hearts. The jewelry shops came to buy in first, jumping three yuan to four thousand and forty yuan. Later, the securities firms and a certain bank competed to buy, and then gradually increased by fifteen yuan. The banks did ten taels to each other for four thousand and fifty-five yuan. Soon, a certain gold shop sold out at a high price, falling back four yuan. A certain gold shop sold 20 taels to the money changer for four thousand and fifty-one yuan as the noon closing price. In the afternoon, because the foreign exchange continued to be slightly weak, the opening was raised by eight yuan. The gold shop entered 20 taels into the jewelry shops for four thousand and fifty-nine yuan. Later, because the securities firms took profits and came out at a high price, and the buyers' appetite was weak, it fell back nine yuan. The securities firms sold 10 taels to the money changer for four thousand and fifty yuan. After that, retail investors came to buy in a little, and it rose again to four thousand and fifty-five yuan. After entering, a certain spot gold shop sold out, and the price fell back again. The gold shop sold 20 taels to the securities firms for four thousand and fifty-one yuan as the evening closing price, and the fruit rose by ten yuan compared to last weekend. The daily fluctuation was thirty-one yuan. The selling price of spot gold from spot gold shops was several yuan higher than the spot gold, and the purchase was reduced by twenty yuan. The current standard gold is more than fifty yuan smaller than the listed gold, and there are few transactions.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Stands Firm</p>
<p>The selling price of jewelry gold per tael has not changed. Da Tong Hang still hangs at four hundred and ten yuan. The new shop has the same price, and the purchase is reduced by about fifteen yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currencies See Mixed Gains and Losses</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currencies fluctuated and were uncertain. The market price of British and American gold pounds rose and fell. The supply and demand were scarce, and the market situation was stable. The demand for British and American gold notes was strong, and the market price was firm. In the early morning, the price of British gold notes rose to forty-six yuan, and the price of American gold notes rose to twelve yuan and five jiao and one fen. In the afternoon, the market situation was even firmer, and the price of American surplus notes once rose to twelve yuan and five jiao and seven fen. Because the tightening trend of the US exchange rate was very slight, the market price returned to being level, and the evening market was twelve yuan and five jiao. The price of Hong Kong notes followed the loose softness due to the smooth supply of Hong Kong exchange. The market price of French francs and Annam notes was slightly weak due to a lack of demand. The price of Philippine notes followed closely behind the US gold notes, rising slightly expensively. The price of Japanese gold notes was slightly firmer, and the evening market was one yuan and two jiao and six fen. The price of Korean notes also rose to one yuan and four fen in the evening market. Yesterday's market price: British gold notes rose two jiao, American gold notes rose seven fen, Hong Kong notes fell five li, French franc notes fell two li, Annam notes fell three fen, Philippine notes rose five fen, and the other currencies did not change.</p>
<h3>After the Foreign Exchange Loosened, There Was Quite a Lot of Settlement</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market conditions, the exchange rate listing, still no change. The dark market of British and American exchanges, although it was the beginning of the week, still had no color. Because the domestic news was complicated today, most speculators remained quiet and waited for changes, and did not dare to act. The situation on the same day was loose first and then back, and finally slightly softer than last weekend. The morning opening was flat. Then, after the foreign bank Huabi first sold out, and then the Hong Kong Telegraph and China Merchants followed each other, the price suddenly hardened to four pence eight seven five and eight yuan six two five. After the foreign firms saw the cheap price and absorbed it slightly, and the foreign banks had a good appetite for the selling price of the seven items, the situation turned stable and was stagnant for a long time. Until noon, unexpectedly, HSBC suddenly came to absorb purchases, and Sassoon's bulls slightly increased their bets, so the market turned tight and soft. By noon, it was only four pence eight two eight two five and seven yuan nine six eight seven five. The afternoon state was extremely quiet, but the market continued to be slightly tight. The result was four pence eight one two five and seven yuan nine three seven five at the close, which was tight 〇 three one two five for British and soft 〇 six two five for US compared to last Saturday. The potential of futures was the same as the spot market.</p>
<p>Hong Kong First Had Sales</p>
<p>In the early morning, because the London big strip and the American bank price were closed for business and there was no electricity, the London raw gold was stagnant. The exchange rates of British, American, Shanghai, and French currencies were all level. American to British was long one two five, to Shanghai unchanged, to France big three seven five. The central listing exchange rates were as before. The bank's morning opening spot selling price: British gold four pence eight four three seven five, American exchange rate eight. Unexpectedly, until noon, the exchange, suddenly came to absorb purchases, plus Sassoon also slightly absorbed, resulting in the market situation turning soft. Until the noon close, the bank's spot selling price: British gold was only four pence eight two eight one two five, and the American exchange rate was seven yuan nine six eight seven five, a squeeze of tight 〇 one five six two five and six two five compared to the opening of the agricultural market.</p>
<p>US Exchange Rate At Eight Yuan</p>
<p>The post-market transaction was light, but the line had a good appetite, so the form was slightly tight. A certain line absorbed the foreign exchange seven yuan nine six eight seven five and a profit of the same line's British gold for the current month four pence eight eight one two five. Until the evening close, the bank's spot selling price: British gold four pence eight one two five, Italian exchange rate seven yuan nine three seven five, next month's futures French gold four pence seven five, American exchange rate seven yuan eight one two five.

<h3>Securities Domestic Debt Multiple Parties, Crowded with People, C and E Once Exceeded Fifty-One Yuan</h3>
<p>The securities dark market, yesterday's market conditions, initially due to the talk of Sino-American loans, and the environment of further rising news, was still flashing and uncertain, and the bulls were too crowded. For a time, the rise was weak, and C and E once broke through the fifty-one yuan mark, and then broke it again. Floating multiples came out, and it could be seen at any time. The market will go back to falling after the light, and then turn to rising again, which is also unknown. Yesterday's experience, the morning trend was very firm, Xinfu Dafeng Lianyi bought in, Datong Hongda Tiansheng sold out, and Maotai Tongyishun and No. 16 also had good stomach capacity. The C species once saw a high price of fifty-one yuan, and the E species also reached outside of fifty-one yuan. Yuanyutong Kang Tongyu Hengfu all had supplies. In the afternoon, people's hearts were slightly lax, and the C and E species immediately broke into fifty-one yuan again.

The result for the whole day was still a rise of one jiao to two jiao and a half. The total number of transactions was 700,000 to 800,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below.</p>

<h3>Yarn Cotton: Customer Appetite Turns Active, Yarn Price Rises, Futures Trading Is Lively</h3>
<p>The yarn market is slightly stable, and at the same time, the real needs of the customer group are more active. The Hong Kong group has a healthy appetite for fine yarn, and the mainland group also needs 21-count yarn. As a result, people's hearts are good, and the bulls are coming to pull up again. The February futures Shuangma's thoughts are also excited again, but the inventory is still thick, and there are also people who sell futures.</p>
<p>The spot yarn morning opening market is peaceful, and the foreign exchange is heard to be lengthening. There are not many buyers in the field. The opening price of 20-count Shuangma is 726 yuan.

<h3>Before the Big End, Cotton Sales Are Weak, Market Price Has No Major Changes</h3>
<p>This cotton transaction is still not prosperous, but the momentum is still stable. The factory's needs are still flat. This is because the Lunar New Year's Eve is approaching, and everyone is preparing to end the year and wait for next year to take action. From this point of view, there may not be much change in the cotton market this year. The sources in northern Jiangsu include 1,140 packages of Tonghua and 54 packages of Changyinsha. The transaction situation of spot cotton is listed on the left.</p>
<p>The market price of foreign cotton, the New York cotton market, was more quiet at the opening of the morning, but it was very firm. Spot merchants had a slight purchase, and the shorts slightly offset. As a result, the market situation was unusually quiet all day, and the cotton price was not much different, compared to the previous day's cohesion of two or three pounds of sound. The Indian cotton market, together with forecasts, rose by more than one rupee. Egypt Liverpool closed the market.</p>
<p>The inquiry for foreign cotton transactions in Shanghai is more than the actual transaction. The yarn price rose slightly again yesterday, so the industry is also on the path of excitement. The general observation is that the cotton price is rising, but because the end of the year is approaching, the funds of all parties are tighter, so the transaction is becoming more and more dull. The factory is also the same. The factory price of yesterday's cotton market converted at the US exchange rate of seven yuan nine three seven five is recorded below.</p>
<h3>Silk Tea: Japanese Silk Plummets, This City's Silk Merchants Wait and See</h3>

<p>The silk market in this port is in a trance, and the market is uneven. Foreign firms and manufacturers are taking a wait-and-see attitude. Even if there are a few transactions, their market price cannot be used as a standard. Yesterday, Jardine Matheson and Bill each entered 20 to 30 dan of white factory, and Jieli Jing Zhengfu brand yesterday Dachang and other entered 80 dan. The silk price is still stable compared to the decline of white factory, it is said.</p>
<h3>Oilcake: Raw Oil Is Firm and Expensive, Soybean Oil Is Mediocre</h3>
<p>The soybean oil market is as mediocre as ever. The Dalian soybean oil, which has been brewing for many days, has also been opened, priced at 97 yuan and five jiao, with 550 barrels traded. Other opened 50 pieces of Yanqi oil, priced at 75 yuan, 250 pieces of Qingqi oil, 73 yuan, 150 pieces of Jiaozhou oil, 70 yuan, and 280 barrels of Hankou bucket factory oil, 97 yuan and five jiao. At the moment, the overall situation is that because the big end is approaching, the buying and selling is not prosperous, and there are still more than 4,000 barrels of Dalian crude oil in the bottom, so there are still few waves.</p>
<p>The production price of raw oil has been reported to be rising. The sellers are firm and expensive, and the market continues to be strong. This street has purchased 300 cans of Yantai Ting oil, priced at 98 yuan, 200 barrels of Tianjin bucket oil, 99 yuan, 50 barrels of Qingdao bucket oil, priced at 100 yuan, and 5,500 cans of raw oil came from Yantai on the 22nd.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains: Yellow Bean's Rising Wind Is Still Fierce</h3>
<p>The price of yellow beans is soaring under the enthusiastic pull of general hoarders. Yesterday, the hoarders of Nanyang Guangshan on this street were eager to buy, and each bean rose by two or three jiao.

On the 22nd, 1,300 bags of raw kernel came from Yantai.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Black Dates Fall Back Slightly</h3>
<p>Black dates have seen an increase in arrivals recently, but the appetite of all parties is turning quiet because the end is approaching, so the market is weak. It was heard that the higher-priced Tongshou dates were priced at over 36 yuan, but the sales received by the trade were still small, it is said.</p>
<h3>Metals: Black Iron Billets Have a Large Number of Sales</h3>
<p>The market for black iron billets, which has been jumping for a long time, has recently seen a surprisingly strong demand from factories on this street, and the market has risen to 87 or 88 yuan. Now, because hoarders and foreign firms have seen this good price, they have sold out in large quantities. The market is full of goods, and the market is in a chaotic state. People's hearts have turned soft, and the opening price has fallen non-stop, from 87 or 88 yuan to 82 or 83 yuan, and by the final closing, it has fallen to 78 or 79 yuan per box (200 pounds), a miserable drop of nearly ten yuan compared to before. It is found that the current stock of this cargo in Shanghai is surprisingly abundant. Although there are purchases from various factories, the amount of sales is even more amazing, so it is inevitable that there will be concerns about oversupply for a while.</p>
<h3>Coal: Charcoal Inventory Is Sufficient</h3>
<p>The charcoal market has also shown a meteoric rise recently due to the snow. The daily market transaction reaches 3,000 to 4,000 loads. Fortunately, the Muller wheel has loaded more than 14,000 loads of Wenzhou charcoal, and miscellaneous goods from various places have poured in, so the inventory is sufficient, the supply and demand are equal, and there is no shortage. Wenzhou Grade A wood charcoal is priced at 11 yuan and five jiao per load, Haimen flat hat charcoal is 7 yuan and eight jiao per load, and retail sales at Menzhuang are one jiao and five fen per pound, it is said.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth Firm Is Preparing to Close Accounts, Foreign Sales Are Still Strong</h3>
<p>The cloth market is slightly clearer in terms of actual sales. Each firm is settling customer accounts, preparing to spend the Lunar New Year, and most people's hearts are looking high. The opening price of each item is trending higher. Yesterday, Yihuo's fine twill suddenly rose by one yuan, and the prices of coarse and fine cloth, bleached cloth, and striped bleached cloth rose by two jiao and a half to five jiao. The prices of local factory's coarse and fine cloth twill have also been raised by one jiao to two jiao and a half per bolt. The sales price of the remaining goods is also firm. The Cantonese group is more prosperous in terms of actual sales, and more than 400 pieces of colored cloth, colored twill, bleached cloth, and coarse cloth have been traded. The Nanyang group has purchased tens of thousands of pieces of bleached, dyed, and printed cloths from foreign countries. This street has traded more than 500 pieces of coarse cloth, fine twill, satin, poplin, and blank cloth. More than 10,000 pieces of blank cloth for the February and March forward periods have also been traded. The demand from the Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Fujian groups has turned weak.</p>
<p>The market for Dongbu's white and colored goods is firm and has not changed much. The spot sale price of 12-pound Longtou fine cloth is 22 yuan and two jiao per bolt, and the price for February futures is 22 yuan and seven jiao and a half, but the amount is not large, only 100 to 200 pieces. The spot price of Longtou fine twill is 21 yuan and five jiao, and the price of Baby is 21 yuan and one jiao. This street has traded more than 500 pieces of fine cloth and fine twill in total. The Tianjin group continues to purchase more than 100 pieces of fine cloth. The market situation is peaceful and hidden.</p>
<h3>Raincoat Cloth Is Still Expensive and Popular</h3>
<p>The real sales of raincoat cloth have been stagnant, because the price has risen and there are few rainy days in winter, but its standard market is still firm. Those who hold the goods expect that there will be less arrival in the future, and wait for the plum rain season to sell at a good price. At the moment, the British-made 4026 single-sided open water rice raincoat cloth is sold at 14 yuan and seven jiao and a half per yard. Non-western double-sided yarn raincoat cloth No. 1 sells for 2 yuan and eight jiao and a half, No. 2 for 2 yuan and six jiao and a half, and Chonglu skin sells for 1 yuan and two jiao and a half. British-made wool surface yarn bottom raincoat cloth No. 1 is 11 yuan, Vice No. 9 yuan, Baobie Lei No. 1 is 16 yuan and a half, and No. 2 is 11 yuan and a half.</p>
<h3>Medicinal Materials: Recruitment of Zhi Zi Source Is Blocked</h3>
<p>The initial opening price of Zhaozhi Zi in the previous market was over 90 yuan. Because the owners all got a good price, it attracted people from all over to hear the news and transport them. The arrival of goods suddenly surged, and then fell sharply, selling for only 67 yuan. According to the news from the producing area, although there is no shortage of inventory, it is difficult to transport out due to being embarrassed, resulting in the source being blocked. At present, Shanghai sales are still active, so the market can be expected to bottom out.</p>

<h3>Bola and the Baker</h3>
<p>— Huang Jiayin</p>
<p>Bola is dead. Bola, the head of the die-hard isolationists in America, is dead.</p>
<p>In international affairs, Bola's views may have been narrow and mistaken, but we cannot blame him too much. People always have weaknesses.</p>
<p>Looking at him as an individual, Bola was a person who dared to speak, take action, be loyal to his life's ideals, and sincerely serve the public. In this regard, we should respect him no matter what.</p>
<p>Yes, he once opposed the New Deal promoted by President Roosevelt of the United States. However, his purpose was to protect the purchasing power of the people.</p>
<p>In 1934, out of concern for the living problems of the poor, he once loudly protested against the resolution to increase the price of each loaf of bread by one cent. For this, he specifically visited a baker.</p>
<p>The baker complained incessantly to him, saying that he was absolutely opposed to the decision to raise the price of bread by one cent, and asked Bola what to do. Bola told him to sell at the original price, and if anyone dared to sue him, he was willing to step forward as a volunteer lawyer.</p>
<p>As a result, the price of bread across the United States fell by one cent. Although it was only a difference of one cent, the help to the lives of ordinary people was more than just one cent.</p>
<p>The newspapers say that after Bola's death, the whole country mourned. This is not surprising, because he was once a friend to the people of the whole country.</p>
<p>Military Equipment</p>
<h3>Short, Agile, and Powerful New Weapons</h3>
<p>— Mo Ming</p>
<p>The era of 16-inch coastal artillery and 14-inch railway guns has passed. Now, the focus of military affairs is gradually shifting to short, agile, and powerful weapons. The power of giant cannons is certainly enough to be awe-inspiring, but the disadvantage of these large items is that they are too bulky and slow. They can only be fixed behind the front line, and their destructive power can only reach the rear of the enemy's front line. As for the new small cannons, they are light and simple, extremely mobile, can advance and retreat with the soldiers on the front line, and can be manipulated at will, choosing the weakest point of the enemy to give a fierce direct attack, and achieve the greatest effect of annihilating the enemy.</p>
<p>This article will introduce three of the newest types of small cannons in the United States:</p>
<p>The first type is the "Tank Cannon." It evolved from the famous 37mm cannon of the World War, but the barrel has been lengthened by one time, and the projectile propulsion has also been expanded, thus creating reliable speed and penetration. The shells it fires fly almost in a straight line. Any tank that approaches the danger zone within a range of one thousand yards will be pierced by it. Moreover, after penetrating, it can explode inside. With this serious damage, any strong land monster will be helpless.</p>
<p>This cannon is equipped with rubber tires and can be towed behind a high-speed car at will. Even on very rough roads, a speed of 50 miles per hour is not difficult. The entire cannon weighs half a ton, and four or five people can carry it and run away quickly.</p>
<p>Light Anti-Aircraft Gun</p>
<p>The second type is the mobile automatic anti-aircraft gun. The firepower of this anti-aircraft gun is really extremely powerful. When firing, it looks like a large machine gun, and can fire one hundred and twenty rounds of highly explosive shells per minute. Moreover, the firing direction can be rotated at will, and the angle is unlimited. It can fire directly, obliquely, or horizontally. Its shell fuses are extremely sensitive, and can even explode when touching the wings of an aircraft. Therefore, the new all-metal aircraft is most suitable for its appetite.</p>
<p>This anti-aircraft gun is extremely light and can also be towed around by car and placed at any location. This is its greatest advantage, which is also the origin of its name.</p>
<p>Short-Range Mortar</p>
<p>The third type is the short-range mortar. Its maximum range is 2,000 yards, and its minimum is 75 yards, which is just beyond the reach of hand grenades. And the three-and-a-half-pound shells it fires are far more powerful than all rifle bullets. At the same time, it is extremely light. Including accessories, the total weight is 50 pounds. It only needs the strength of one person to take care of it properly. Therefore, it can be said to be the most practical weapon on the battlefield. This mortar is extremely small and exquisite. A two-foot-deep trench or a few-foot-high shrub can completely cover it up. Another advantage is that it does not produce any smoke when firing, so even at a very close distance, it is extremely difficult for the enemy to detect its position.</p>
<p>According to the opinion of military strategists, if Poland had several hundred of these new small cannons, the history of last September would have been greatly changed. Who knows what kind of chessboard the current world situation would be!</p>

<h3>Letter to Mother</h3>
<p>— Mo Ran</p>
<p>During the First World War, there was a British officer, a lieutenant named Heath, 28 years old, who wrote a letter in France on July 11, 1915, to comfort his mother. The letter expressed a very open-minded view of life. The writing was simple and natural, and the emotions were sincere and moving, leaving people with endless feelings after reading it. Lieutenant Heath died on the European front on October 8 of the same year. Reading this last letter makes one feel that life is like a dream.</p>
<p>My Dearest Mother:</p>
<p>Today is Sunday, but we will have to work as usual in a few hours. I feel I need to tell you some things I have been wanting to say for a long time. When I set out on my journey and said goodbye to you, I told you that the thing that worried and disturbed me the most was that you would be saddened by my going to the front or dying in battle. Now that the day of death is near, I have the same feeling. I don't think death is a very great fear. I think that if I die in battle, the people who will really be saddened will definitely be you and other people who love me. I am writing this letter to explain to you, please don't be sad for me.</p>
<p>We have always distinguished the boundaries between life and death very clearly. But in our lives, we spend half of our time in sleep, so when we are awake, we know that we are often only half alive. Life is actually a kind of quality rather than a quantity; at certain times in life, life seems to be extremely great and valuable, and measuring its moments with a clock seems meaningless. These precious moments have very grand power. We do not know when they will end, because they can color our remaining lives and forever become a source of strength and joy. If we could preserve these precious moments and get rid of the rest of the time, that would be the best thing. Just as these joyful moments fill our own lives, I hope they will also last in the experiences of our relatives and friends, exert power in people's lives, and create a permanent rebirth. Let me give a personal example. When I am appreciating music, I can best feel the true meaning of life; I hope that those who love me and die after me can not only make my love of music a memory of the past, but also regard it as a power that can increase the beauty of music. Also, we love the plains of our hometown; if I die in battle, I hope that those "associations" will not make you too sad. I hope that you will not only regard that plain as a memory of the past, but also make it infuse into your life, so that you will feel a new joy when you spend your vacation there. If I die in battle, please at least do not let the things I love make you suffer, but rather increase your happiness, because I feel happy in these things. In this way, all my happiness can continue to exist. I really can't bear to think of you suffering because of my death.</p>

<h3>Life and Faith</h3>
<p>— Yang Tongfang</p>
<p>Life and faith. Have a close connection. Many people feel the emptiness and boredom of life, as if they are forever trapped in a deep abyss, not seeing a trace of light and heat, because their lives lack a firm faith. A life lacking faith is like a lone boat in the sea that has lost its compass, wandering.</p>
<p>However, the faith in life mentioned here does not refer specifically to those narrow religions and doctrines, but to all the driving forces that are reflected in human consciousness and that are sufficient to promote and improve life upwards. This driving force is the fermenting enzyme for striving for the value of human life, and no one can be without it.</p>
<p>Many great ideas and truths obtained through long-term struggles and studies in history are all materials that we should absorb and extract from our lives. We must regard these great ideas and truths as the goals of life; so that our lives can move forward and strive upward because of this firm belief.</p>
<p>Many great figures in the world, when they suffered the tribulations of the environment, never failed to feel frustrated and disappointed, but they still mustered their courage, and their hope for the pursuit of light and happiness never disappeared. They ultimately reached the road to success. There is no other reason for this. The faith in life encourages them and excites them.</p>
<p>People living in difficult and distressed situations should overcome the demons of disappointment, frustration, worry and depression as early as possible, and quickly strengthen their faith in life. Faith in life can increase the courage to pursue light and heat, can unleash the inherent potential of individuals, and enrich the meaning of life. From then on, we will no longer feel the emptiness and boredom of life, because the faith in life is the guide, it will tell us how to live and how to live a more meaningful life.</p>
<p>When we struggle out of a life of emptiness and boredom and walk towards the avenue of a life of faith, it is like seeing an oasis in a desolate desert, a kind of joy.</p>
<h3>Dangerous Elements</h3>
<p>— Gu</p>
<p>We should treat our country like women treat the men they love. A wife who loves her husband is willing to do anything for her husband except stop criticizing her husband and asking her husband to improve. We should also focus on our country with the same enthusiasm and keen eyes. We should love our country, but we must also constantly point out the country's mistakes. The dangerous elements in the country are not critics, but those so-called patriots who chant high-sounding slogans. – Words of the famous British writer Blisley.</p>

<h3>Practicing the Plain Clothing Movement</h3>
<p>— Shou Xun</p>
<p>Recently, I read Mr. Yan Ciping's article "Advocating the Plain Clothing Movement in the Film Industry" in Qingqing Movie, and I very much agree with this move. It is indeed necessary to abstain from luxury and advocate thrift during this extraordinary period, especially for people in our film industry. The average young and young mistress-style movie fans pay special attention to the clothing of movie actors and thus imitate them. Therefore, if actors wear plain clothes on weekdays, she or he will definitely rise up to imitate them and recognize plain clothes as a kind of beautiful, economical, and generous clothing.</p>
<p>In the film industry, except for a few people with higher status and larger salaries, the rest of the salaries are almost insignificant. It is already difficult in today's expensive world, but they all think that a star must have gorgeous clothes, otherwise they will arouse people's contempt and lose the style of a big star. Therefore, even if they are in a difficult situation, their clothes must be exquisite, which is really a big mistake. I hope that our film industry colleagues will not have this bad habit of luxury in the future, and will unite to support the plain clothing movement and practice the plain clothing doctrine.</p>
<h3>The Annual "Storytelling Gathering"</h3>
<p>— Yu Xiu</p>
<p>Every year when the Lunar New Year is approaching, Shanghai theaters are bound to hold a "gathering performance," and storytelling venues also have this old tradition. When the Lunar New Year's Eve arrives, each "venue owner" tries to rope in "big name" storytellers to hold a "storytelling gathering," and the situation is quite lively.</p>
<p>The original intention of holding a "storytelling gathering" was to raise funds to help the orphans, widows, the poor, and the sick in the storytelling industry. Therefore, tea and water were not provided to the audience, and the participating employees only received travel expenses, without any "shares." The venue owner also acted entirely out of obligation, without taking any fees, in order to reduce expenses and increase the amount of aid funds. However, the storytelling gatherings held in various Shanghai venues today charge double the price, rope in particularly many "names," take shares as usual, and split the profits equally. The storytellers and the venue owners jointly rely on it as a major source of "New Year's expenses," which is already different from the original charity with a relief nature.</p>
<p>The "storytelling gathering" also contains a kind of comparison and examination effect on the storytelling skills of the employees. An ordinary character who is usually unknown can become a big name as long as he can become popular in the storytelling gathering. For example, Zhang Hongsheng, the "Hero of the Air Force," and storytellers, emerged from the storytelling gathering in the past, thus becoming famous in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>"Sending off the guests" is undoubtedly an important role in the storytelling gathering. It can also be said to be the mainstay of this storytelling gathering. However, it is difficult to send off so many guests completely happily without a special skill that can make the audience very satisfied. It is possible that because they cannot be sent off, they will be shouted down to "pour out the soup," which would inevitably be embarrassing on the spot and greatly lose face. Therefore, not only do "small juniors" who have just come out of the "guild" not dare to take on the responsibility rashly, but even first-class big names regard it as a daunting task.</p>
<p>In previous years, on Lunar New Year's Eve, Huiquanlou had an all-night storytelling gathering, commonly known as the "Debt-Evading Storytelling." Because some audience members who were full of debts would simply come to a "don't bother," "New Year's Eve dinner" was already served, and they would drill into the storytelling venue, listening until the morning of New Year's Day, and then go to the Rainbow Temple in the faint morning light to see the sisters from the northern quarter burning incense, feasting on beauty, which was also a way to have fun.</p>
<h3>Biography of Jeanette MacDonald, the Female Lead in *The Girl of the Golden West*</h3>
<p>— Ming Ming</p>
<p>Jeanette MacDonald was born on June 18. She is the youngest of three sisters. She gave a solo performance at her sister's dance school when she was just three years old. She had this ambition from an early age to dedicate herself to the red carpet.</p>
<p>One summer, her father took her to New York for business. Her father went to handle business on his own, but she went to the theater to visit her sister. The theater owner saw this beautiful little girl with cloud-like hair and agreed to let her try out for two weeks. As a result, her father moved the whole family to New York so that her sisters could live there.</p>
<p>After performing in the theater for a while, she played a supporting role in the play "The Irish." Then she got another opportunity to perform. Although it was a small part of the performance, it happened that the playwright and her husband were visiting. They were both fascinated by MacDonald's acting skills and immediately signed a contract with her to play the leading role in the play "The Magic Ring," gradually entering the ranks of stars.</p>
<p>When she was singing in the play "Angela" on Broadway, someone hired her to be Litch Dex's partner, and the first test shot. When director Ernst Lubitsch was making "The Love Parade," he visited everywhere to find the female lead in the film. It happened that this director had seen the fragment of her previous test shot and specially came to New York to hire her and signed a two-year contract, and has been popular ever since.</p>
<p>Under the banner of MGM's lion, she has produced many more singing blockbusters, such as "The Merry Widow," "Naughty Marietta," "Rose-Marie," and "San Francisco," all of which have strong box office appeal. Now her new work, "The Girl of the Golden West," is a singing blockbuster with very strong emotions, making people feel sad and not knowing where to shed tears. Her performance is superb and closely captures the audience's emotions. It is no wonder that a multi-talented female artist like this was elected by American movie fans as the 1930s movie queen.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Drama and Art Society Tries Out Revolving Stage</h3>
<p>After moving to Lafayette Avenue, the second public performance of the Shanghai Drama and Art Society successively staged two major dramas - "Motherland" and "Chen Yuanyuan," which were extremely popular with the audience. The third drama is "Love and Intrigue," adapted by Gu Zhongyi and directed by Xu Qu, and co-starring Mo Rong Wan'er, the newly hired female lead of "Confucius," and Vera Xu Lihu Dao, etc. The content of the drama is quite conducive to using the revolving stage, and the revolving stage of Lafayette has never been used since it was built. Now I really want to take the opportunity to try it out. However, since this stage has never been used before, it is not yet known whether it can be used. So it has to be tested beforehand. It will probably be decided in a day or two. If there are no accidents and it can be realized, it will still be an unprecedented event in the drama world. By the way, it can be reported that Ying Yin came to Shanghai from Chongqing to participate in the filming of "Empress Dowager Cixi" by United Artists. The Drama and Art Society has a "blood" relationship with her, so she was invited to the society on the morning of the 21st to talk about the drama situation in the mainland. She was very good at talking, and talked about the dynamics of the drama people in the mainland in great detail, and the listeners were very excited.</p>
<h3>Unofficial History of the Pear Garden</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>Zhang Rongkui is old but strong (Part 1)</p>
<p>It's been a long time since I saw old actors perform. The day before yesterday was the birthday of Master Huihai. There was the old actor Zhang Rongkui's "Wu Zhaoguan." He is known for his "kao ba" old man roles, so I went to watch it. There were many old amateur actors in the audience who came for this play. Rongkui worked extra hard to reward the confidants. Singing, acting, reading, and fighting were all wonderful. Although he has been teaching drama for years and does not often practice his voice, his pitch is still above the zhenggong. The words all come from the dantian, and his high notes can really shake the roof tiles and stop the clouds. Several postures are beautiful and stylish. This is all thanks to his deep childhood skills, so although his voice has not been practiced for years and his skills have not been practiced for months, he is still high-pitched, round, and smooth when he occasionally performs. There is a special point in this play, that is, the male and female leads sing a reverse board "[(Female) The soldiers are trapped in Chanyu (Male) Empress Ma is sad]." This kind of singing is not often seen in other plays. The popular plays in Shanghai have so-called five-tone and nine-tone ensemble, often three or four people singing together, connecting dozens of sentences, and also two people singing one sentence together, one person singing the first half of the sentence and the other person singing the second half of the sentence. At first, it feels quite novel. In fact, this kind of singing is all transformed from plays such as "Er Jin Gong" and "Wu Zhaoguan." It can be seen that if you want to create something new, you still need to study the old ones more. There are indeed good things in the old goods. Zhang Rongkui started out in the Xiao Rongchun Opera Troupe, which was presided over by Yang Rongshou (named Quan, the grandfather of Yang Shengchun). He, Yang Xiaolou, and Cheng Jixian were all fellow apprentices. Da Li Wu (Shunting) could not sing in his later years, so he often recommended Rongkui to partner with the old Tan as Zhou Dewei in "Zhu Lian Zhai" (Zhou has two types of faces, one with makeup and one without. If it is played by Qian Jinfu, it belongs to the Jing line and wears makeup; if it is played by Da Li Wu, it belongs to the Sheng line and wears no makeup. Rongkui is a follower of Li.</p>
