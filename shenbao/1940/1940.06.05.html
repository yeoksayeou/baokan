<h3>義大利參戰問題的檢討</h3>
<p>在所有的各種國際問題中，關於義大利的問題，是使觀察家最難了解的一個。事在當前，爲全世界人們關心着，國際問題研究者探索着，各國當政者奔忙着的，尤其是義大利參戰與否的問題。不過，我們透過了煙幕，撇去了枝葉，一下子就從根本地方去檢討的話，那末，一幅非常明顯的圖畫，就立刻會展在了我們的面前。</p>
<p>首先，我們應當指出來的是；自英法對德宣戰以來的義大利態度，在法理上，祗是宣稱了「暫不參加」，而不是國際法上的宣佈「中立」。在實質上，他所謂「暫不參加」，却正是參加這次不同通常戰爭的一種特殊方式。換句話說：從開戰到目前爲止的這一時期、他以「暫不參加」的武器，參加了德國對英法的戰鬥。何以見得？簡單地說（一）在米源方面，德義兩國的關係，恰如英法之間一樣，存在着同盟關係，而義大利　採取「不戰一態度，是出於德國的授意，他自已的同意。析言之，在一個整套雙簧戲裏，這一時期，德國扮的角色　「戰　；而義大利却是「不戰」。（二）在作用方面，可以分　兩點；第一，義大利不參戰　英法對於地中海不能封鎖；售又國爲與德國是同盟國家，不構成國際法上的「中立」，所以也就沒有不替同盟國運輸軍火原料等物的義務。因此，義大利算是爲德國組織了龐大的海上運輸隊，使英法視爲唯一致德國死命的封鎖手段完全失了效。第二，在央，法對德宣戰後，同時對於義大利又不得不以龐大軍力，從事於戒備；隨着戰爭的演進，義大利的「參戰與不參戰」這一着棋可以連用的地方，眞是多極了，而加於國際政治上的力量也是大極了。在這擒縱之間，究竟義大利出以實際參加戰鬥的方式與德有利呢，還是保持所謂「暫不參加」與德有利？關於這一問題，牽涉到軍事等種種方面，非可簡單說明；但據一般研究者的共同結論，大多認爲不參戰的有利於德國，尤大於參戰。</p>
<p>因此之故，澈底說起來，目前並不發生義大利參戰與吾的問題。而當前問題的核心，祇是義大利是不是曾由特殊方式的參戰，渡到普通方式的參戰；亦即是否將由所謂「暫不參戰」的戰略，演進爲兵戎相見？</p>
<p>如果義大利這一次劍拔弩張的　現，祇是政治作用，祇是爲了助長所謂德國方面行將開始的「和平攻勢」，則終於不參加實際戰鬥。不然，假設他所表現的恣態，確是有其實際內容，則決定他參加實際戰鬥與否的關鍵，在於英，法對地中海封鎖問題的態度。</p>
<p>在目前戰爭這樣擴大的局面下，英，法方面爲了爭取對德戰爭的勝利，則像這幾個月來義大利爲德國在地中海輸運軍火，原料等物品的現象，當然爲英法所再不能坐視的，挪威戰爭中，英法堵塞德國仆北海通路的目的，已經完全達到。當前的德國所有通路兩條，一條是大陸上的穌聯方面，另一條就是地中海。關於堵塞陸路，英法方面無施用實力的可能，也沒有必要，大槪可以由外交途徑去設法解決；至於地中灣方面，英法當前可循的途徑却有三條：第一，不管義大利反應如何，强制封鎖地中海；第二，强迫義大利宣佈「中立」，然後嚴格施行海上檢查：第三，强迫或以利誘，使義大利提出保證，不以軍火，原料等物供給德國。這三者，都不是當前的義大利所願　受。他的唯一答覆。據他自己暄嚷着，就是　行加入戰爭；亦即暗示着：旣然「暫不參加」的作用失去了，那惟有明明白白地揭去面幕而參戰。</p>
<p>所以，英法倘若放任地中海通路的原狀，則不能遂行對德戰略；倘若堵塞地中海上德國的通路，則將促使義大利實際參加戰鬥。這兩方式，是有待英法選擇的歧途。至於義大利，於英法採取第二途徑時，倘若在取得某種條件之下，接受了英法辦法。即等於取銷德義同盟；倘若反對英法辦法，忠於德義同盟，即須與英法開戰。這兩方式，是有待義大利選擇的歧途。自然，當事者在決策的時候，多多少少的，有着受拘束的地方，也還都有點伸縮的餘地。不過，我們把各種因素和趨勢綜合觀察，其勢終於趨向決裂之途。所爭者、祇是時日遲早而已。</p>
<h3>歐局緊張聲中　日對荷印懷抱野心　有田外相之露骨表示　儼然以東亞霸主自居</h3>

<h3>邱吉爾在下院　報告戰事形勢　德政北路來勢兇猛　英法聯軍艱苦應戰</h3>
<p>倫敦　首相邱吉爾今日在下院陳述戰事之進行情形曰、自色當與末斯河法軍之防綫在五月之第二星期被突破後、應比王籲請開入比境之英法軍於是僅有疾退至阿米安與南部、始能自保、但此事實未　實現、法軍總司令初以爲法軍力能彌補缺口、而北部大軍同在其指揮之下、且在當時退却、將令二十師以上比國精良之陸軍遭敵摧毀、並委棄比利時全部土地、此點幾可豫決者也、故當發覺德軍侵入之力量與範圍、及當魏剛將軍代甘茂林將軍任法軍總司令時、比境英法軍乃努力堅守比軍之右方、並將彼等自已之勁旅給予新成之法軍、該軍須以强厚之實力進至索美河而扼守之、惟惟德軍未幾即湧至北部大軍之右翼與後方、計用鐵甲師八九師之多、每師約有各種鐵甲車四百輛、該軍截斷我軍與法國主力軍間之一切交通、於是我軍糧食　與軍火接濟之路遂斷、蓋一切接濟首須經過阿米安、繼須經過阿白維爾也、德軍施疾達海濱波洛業與加萊、且幾達鄧扣克、在此鐵甲與機械化軍隊逆襲之後、有巨數德國師團分乘卡車、卡車之後、始爲密集之德國尋常陸軍、徒步而進、比較稍慢、德國人民固時時準備被導蹂躪他國土地、至於自由與安舒、彼等皆從未領略者也、</p>
<p>此鐵甲師之打擊幾達鄧扣克、雖未確定、然幾可必、波洛業與加來旋皆成苦戰之地、波洛業之守軍作短時之抵禦後、奉英政府之命令而撤退、來福槍兵一旅第六十來福槍隊、維多利亞后來福槍隊、與英坦克車兵一大隊及法兵千名、共約四千名、則堅守加萊到底、（衆歡呼）德軍曾限英旅長在一小時內投降、即爲該員斥拒、（衆歡呼）經四日之劇烈巷戰後、加萊遂寂無聲息、此可以紀念之抵禦戰、遂告終止、海軍僅救出未傷之餘生者三十人、至其同袍之命運、則吾人未能知之、惟彼等之犧牲、未擲諸虛牝、至少有鐵甲兵兩師曾調至克服彼等、否則該兩師將往攻擊英逮征軍矣、彼等之牽制德軍已在輕裝師團戰史中增加光榮之一頁矣、蓋在此時、使水路至格拉維里納止、得仍開啟、而由法軍扼守、藉此使鄧扣克港仍得通行、迨北部大軍發覺不能重行組織經阿米安而與法車互相策應之交通錢時、則祇有一途可擇、此時似確陷於絕望矣、英法比軍幾被包圍、其唯一退却路綫、爲退至一港與其附近之海灘、彼等當時曾受各方面之猛攻、而敵軍人數超出多倍、</p>
<p>余於一星期前請下院擇定本日下午陳述戰情時、余深恐屆時不宣布吾人悠久歷史上之最大軍事劫患、將甚感困難、精於許斷者數人與余同見、當時余意　得登船者殆不過二三萬人而已、法國第一軍全部與駐守阿米安至阿白維爾間缺口北面之英遠征軍全部似必將在平野遭敵擊破、或因糧食軍火告罄而投降矣，此種嚴重之消息、爲余將請下院與全國凖備聆之者、吾人往日與將來所依賴以建造戰軍今幾階段中之英國偉大陸軍之英國陸軍、其根蒂核心與腦髓似全將在戰地湮滅、或將陷入屈辱或飢餓之投降、此爲一星期前之氣象、但另一打擊可以證明其爲致命的、而父突然降於吾人比王前曾籲請吾人予以援助、苟此君主與其政府未與在上次戰爭中拯救比國免於滅亡之協約國斷絕、茍彼等木圖藏身於致命的中立中、則法英軍目始不特可以保全比利時、甚至或可保全波蘭也、（四日路透電）</p>

<h3>歐戰背景　使德辱命記（五）　節譯漢德森爵士原著</h3>
<p>一九三八年九月二十九日午後一時三十分，英法德義四國巨頭，會議於慕尼克之國社黨新厦。墨索里尼自羅馬乘火車至，達拉第則自巴黎乘飛機至，張伯倫接踵而至。德國民衆夾道歡呼。四巨頭討論歷十三小時，至星期五午前二時三十分始舉。各方均能平心靜氣從長計議。墨索里尼在座，希特勒尤未便發作。墨索里尼之調洽雙方建議，更使妥協易成。里本特洛甫之計乃不售。會議所以延緩結束者，多因每人發言，皆須譯成英法德三國言語，目因草案難以忽遽擬定。叫巨頭中能操此三種言語者，唯墨索里尼一人而已。卒乃參酌希特勒在戈得斯堡所提備忘錄，及英法絡續所提修正案，擬定最後協定，即世界聞名之慕尼克協定是也。</p>
<p>慕尼克協定使希特勒未能外願以償者，約有三事，即予德軍以作戰經騐，本人自爲征服他國之英雄，向捷克總統貝余斯及捷人洩憤是。張伯倫消弭德國軍民所反對之世界大戰，在某種意義上，或爲希特勒所當銘感者。特在另一方面言之，希特勒被迫變更用兵計劃，即有感荷之意，亦必爲其滿腔怨憤所湮沒矣。抑希特勒一部份僚屬，恒促其乘英國小備之時，與之一戰，今竟接受慕尼克協定，無乃坐失良機。事後，希特勒深恐此輩主戰派之言不謬，大感不安，暴躁者多。</p>
<p>即以慕尼克會議經歷而論，希特勒所與折衝者三人，身份相等，無一低首伺奉之輩。希特勒獲此經騐，自是厥後，遂不喜談判解決各種問題。而張伯倫先生在德時，衆望所歸，未免有損希特勒威望，此希特勒所不快者也。</p>
<p>希特勒奧人也，奧人僥倖取巧之特性，實希特勒所具備。經緯萬端，不知所終。所不幸者，希特勒適逢具會，乃得日益猖在，不可一世。其行險取巧也，羽黨暗中準備，希特勒本人則靜候對方有所失着，即乘機而入。一九三八年三月，奧總理許斯尼格，舉行公民投票，翌年三月，捷克政府妄自干涉斯洛伐克，希特勒不露聲色，乘機進取，均其實例。慕尼克協定成立之後，德國實稱徊於冒險進取與保守現狀兩途之聞。就常　論，德國若循保守現狀之途，則民眾安居樂業，希特勒本人，六年來旣建偉績，亦應稍息，俾得進行其復興德國計劃。希特勒所謂祈求長期和平，應屬出衷之言。一九三九年二月中旬，余返柏林時，希特勒對於保守途，縱未計議及，特何日再度冒險，亦未決定耳。數日後，余與之相値，彼似眞樂於見余者。時戈林將赴義大利海賓休假。里本特洛甫信余久離職守，實因染恙，而與十一月間虐侍猶太人後美大使被召回國事無關，對余態度亦佳。此種印象，使余遽抱樂觀，惟迅知其謬矣。</p>
<p>三月一日，希特勒招待外交團年宴，余首覺大局又凶多吉少。蕓希特勒恒於宴畢立於會客室中，與各國使節分別談話五分鐘十分鐘不等。上月間與余相値時會與余握手三次之多，狀頗親善，此次已不然，向余發言時，態度閃爍，目不直視，所言多空泛，力稱英國不必在中歐阻撓德國。此言余前已熟聞，雖無新奇驚人處，但其態度則不無令人生惘然不安之感。事後思之，彼必已權衡對捷用兵之輕重，而決定於三月十五日發動矣。余乃憶及隔年三月三日與之會晤情况。時彼念念不忘維也納，德軍卒於三月十一日長驅入奧。是年則於三月十一日決定佔領捷克。其時維也納大軍雲集，以待希特勒檢閱，慶祝德奧合併一週年紀念，且陳兵德國南部，以壯一義國向法國要索之聲勢焉。</p>
<p>希特勒一旦決定，必使之在合理空氣中進行。三月十一日遂召斯洛伐克天主敎蒂梭神父辛柏林，勸其宣佈獨立，自任總統，置期洛伐克蕞爾小邦受德保護。捷克總統哈嘉，爲望本國倖免侵略恐怖，至少兾獲人道的待遇計，乃亦繼蒂梭之後，於三月十四日抵柏林，此行實完全出於目動。</p>
<p>殊不知希特勒絕無人道可言。哈嘉年邁體弱，其女隨行照顧。德方迎之如禮。其女抵車站，里本特洛甫贈以鮮花一束，比抵旅舍，希特勒贈糖一盒。此其所謂人道也。捷克外長契伐柯期基隨總統同行。哈嘉與里本特洛甫互相拜會後，希特勒以晨間一時延見哈嘉於總理府。德籍醫師一人隨待於總理府，俾哈嘉於談話時病體不支，時爲之診治，第哈嘉未抵總理府前，德軍已關人捷克矣。</p>
<p>希特勒與哈嘉至晨四時乃止。哈嘉告希特勒，深以捷克軍隊中之志十迎擊侵略者爲慮。希特勒即向之警告，果若是，則德空軍立當轟炸捷京，時戈林已趕回，亦作是言。迭經掙扎，哈嘉乃親田電話以此意告各閣員。除此而外，哈嘉唯有簽訂怕擬之賣國條約耳。</p>
<p>哈嘉垂垂老矣，吾則當能勉力保持一國元首之尊而拒絕簽字。三月十五日晨，希特勒已先哈嘉而抵捷京，向衆宜佈置捷克爲德附席。</p>
<p>波蘭問題旋亦緊張，余乃於七月二十九日擬一晤希特勒未果。時希特勒正偕里本特洛甫視察齊格斐防綫，不祥之兆也。幾而戰雲漸密，法軍已動員，英海軍亦劍及履及。此其作用乃欲向希特勒表示準備作戰。特里本特洛甫處之泰然，彼始終以爲英國決不致作戰。</p>
<p>希特勒時亦夜郞自大，竟目里本特洛甫爲卑斯麥第二。而里本特洛甫亦以此自許，因主一戰，以證實其地位，卑斯麥會不惜僞造伊姆斯一電以挑動普法之戰，里本特洛甫，自不妨東施效顰，抹煞英國眞意，以圖一逞。彼對於但澤及波蘭甬道問題之解決條件，拒不交余，豈非卑斯麥之故智歟。戈林會謂余曰，「君所不喜里本特洛甫者，乃其剛愎耳」。余答曰，彼之剛愎處，有時竟昏庸也。</p>
<p>希特勒何時開始與斯太林談判，固屬疑問。關於希特勒四月二十八日之演說、其往時敵視蘇聯之論調，顯已不見；迨至五月三日，擁護國聯食之李維諾夫，亦解除外交委員長之職；更數星期，蘇聯新任駐德大使由希特勒延見，優禮有加；凡此種種，要皆爲其蛛絲馬跡。蘇聯所以與德成立協定者，無非欲使之與英法同歸于盡，俾得從中漁利耳。</p>
<p>直至八月，希特勒以下諸人，亦莫不以此抨擊英法與蘇聯之談判。</p>
<p>八月二十三日余往貝許德期加登會見希特勒。時里本特洛甫已抵莫斯科簽訂德蘇條約，希特勒意志得意滿，不惜以此約價值如何如何爲言。余乃以其往日反蘇聯態度詰之。彼一時瞠目不知所止，繼乃曰，驅其投入蘇聯懷抱者英法也。</p>
<p>德蘇條約旣成，波蘭局勢乃尖銳化。八月三十一日，德方宣佈對波最後要求。翌晨，余自戈林左右得知其詳，即以之轉告波蘭大使李普期基，呈報該國政府。此乃波蘭大使得與本國當局通電話之最後一次，迨至晚間，即被禁止矣。是日中午，余通告德外部，謂波政府已接受英政府勸告，正飭李普斯基大使與德政府接洽，對于但澤問題，務當立即實行一種臨時辨法。德方迄未作復。波政府旋飭李普斯基大使晤里本特洛甫。局勢因又得延　十二小時。但希特勒所欲知者，李普斯基是否係全權代表。否則箭已上弦，波蘭非屈服，即須被痛擊。</p>

<h3>趁高不乏了結　金市漲勢受阻</h3>
<p>昨現金烚赤暗　市况、徘徊於六千四百元內外、雖匯市走緊、買氣頗濃、終因散戶浮多守　高　　出、漲勢受阻、晨開為六千四百八十元、較上日猛跳一百五十元、聞係某金號搜購殷切所致、嗣以散戶錢兌業等斷續吐售、及匯市回硬、緩緩降至六千三百二十元、惟結果外匯仍緊、證券帮金號前來扒進、午收告六千四百元、午後初時情况仍熱烈、證券帮金號再撈、遂由六千四百二十元高達四百五十元、至收盤前散戶錢兌業曁銀號一致力賣、結果為六千三百七十元、較上日續漲四十元、收盤後市勢疲弱、最後六千三百四十元、尚無買戶、全天交易約三千數百兩、銀樓飾金結果平平、海關金等呆定、</p>
<p>烚赤尚漲四十元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初以外匯報緊、人心堅挺、某金號首來吸入證券帮二十兩、為六千四百八十元、以隔昨做好一百五十元、繼因散戶頗願賣出、不時傾吐、且斯時銀樓帮錢兌業等亦紛來拋賣、而不久匯市忽告回硬、銀號帮吃胃漸弱、未幾即回落一百三十元、銀號出錢兌業十兩、遜為六千三百五十元、旋賣者漸少、銀號帮及證券帮互相搜入、價復向上、重出六千四百元大關、錢兌業進銀號二十兩、為六千四百二十元、卒因外匯仍報回鬆、錢兌業散戶等復來拋賣、月同時金號亦塞、復見回落一百元、金號出銀號二十兩、為六千三百二十元、午刻外匯復走緊勢、買風重起、證券帮金號一再搜買、再又提升一百元、錢兌業進銀號二十兩、為六千四百二十元、將近收盤時、重稍回落、銀號出金號二十兩、為六千四百元作午收價、午後開時景况頗佳、銀號進金號等五十兩、為六千四百二十元、此後賣者尚多、銀號互做三十兩、遜為六千四百十元、嗣因某金號及證券帮猛吸、重拉起四十元、金號進銀號三十兩、為六千四百五十元、後以買者轉少、浮多見景脫手、市勢頓告向下、立退至六千四百元關邊、後再加錢兌業銀號不斷吐塞、回落數十元、金號出錢兌業十兩、為六千三百六十元、入後證券帮進銀號三十兩、為六千三百七十元作晚救價、結果比上日軋漲四十元、收後銀號猛吸、而錢兌業及散戶等頗有賣胃、六千三百六七十元成交頗旺、入後卒因進者止扒、最後六千三百四十元、尚無買戶、全天一百六十元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤較高　數　、收進减低　十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十餘元、均鮮　　、</p>

<h3>外幣起落倐忽</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市况、起落極端倐忽、英美金鎊晨以烚赤猛跳、各方需要頗殷、市價繼續挺漲、後以金市因獲利多頭了結回跌、金鎊價亦回平、英金票稍有需要、市價略漲、美金票於九點半左右、竟高至二十元、午後則傳義大利已決定參戰、晚市退為十九元三角、比上日仍略漲　分、香港票隨港滬滙兌續漲七分、日金票及朝鮮票供求尚勻、晚市前者為一元一角三分、後者為九角六分、</p>

<h3>證券　內債人心一振</h3>
<p>外股沉悶已極　中比美債抽籤</p>
<p>證券暗　、昨日市况均起漲風、蓋　棗陽克復後、人心為之一振、空頭不無恐慌、現多空雙方因其不接不離無從措手、故買賣亦閃爍不定、一度高漲後、每易受挫折、尚未達真正漲風時期也、昨日交易較旺、甲種穿出六十元、戊種亦衝出五十元、通記聯益及　昌收進甲戊兩種為多、鴻康潤利同康　有賣出、午收市價高起三五六角、午後初開尤勁、聯益生大庚興及益昌均有需要、惟十六號出戊遵逢收者甚少、頓見疲軟、潤利久豐及胡鶴記均有賣出、市况頓見回鬆二三角、但結果仍好　一角半至五角半不　、成交總數共計五十餘萬元、茲外簡明表於　、</p>

<p>股票交易、成交紗布交易所股五十股、倡為現鈔四十　　　、</p>
<p>衆業股市交易、復甚缺乏、價格竟日無大變化、空氣沉悶已極、將近收盤趨勢驟軟、賣風轉厲、各股幾俱以最低價收盤、雖所跌並不能謂為激烈、</p>
<p>一九二八年中比美金六釐債券第二十五次抽籤還本、已於本月三日在滬舉行、計抽中債票二千二百四十七張、每張票面美金一百元、應還本美金二十二萬四千七百元、規定於本年七月一日償還、茲將其中籤號碼及中籤債票張數彙誌如次、（括號內為債票張數）一四（三八四）、一六（三三八）、五五（二八四）、八五（三八五）、九〇（四四〇）、〇二五（四九）、一四九（四五）、三四九、五三〇、六三〇、七四九、（各五〇）、九二二（四九）、九三〇（五〇）、二〇三〇、四一二五、五六二二、八四四九（各五）、〇三四二五、〇六四四九、四二一二五、（各一）、</p>

<p>倫敦三日（週一）電、今日中國外債掛牌行市、仍告平穩、上下檔各債券概無變動、</p>
<h3>紗花　紗號清理　投機膽寒　市場買賣已非昔比</h3>
<p>紗市平靜、不脫盤旋之境、此因原料甚　、廠方獲利　厚、且一般投機商　心思、不及昔日之濃厚、所以市場成交較為减少、且報載清理紗號之啟事紛繁、於是人心愈見膽寒、雖有一部份仍在買進賣出、然多數鑒於如斯情形、大有放手旁觀、等待時機、再決雌雄矣</p>
<p>現紗晨開、二十支雙馬承上日午後、人氣熱烈、續進為一千四百元、微跌至一千三百八十五元、旋聞滙票仍見下縮、買風忽熾、漲至一千四百二十五元、詎料價格一高、引起獲利者出籠、檯面一鬆、市盤頃刻下瀉、至一千三百六十元、收盤稍回好、查半日間成交統計一千五百九十包、行情二十支雙馬漲二十元、今日有紗六百五十件運香港、茲將各帮口買去之額量、分別如左、</p>

<h3>廠紗出貨較艱　棉市凋零</h3>
<p>本棉交易、異常凋零、廠方仍無需要、此因廠家高價開出之紗、近受市面影響、出貨　艱、所以原棉生意、仍屬呆滯也、茲將現棉做開者列後、</p>
<p>康江花　二〇五·〇〇　同行進　一〇〇件</p>
<p>奧姆拉　二〇四·〇〇　又　一〇〇件</p>
<p>大中集　二四五·〇〇　又　一五〇包</p>
<p>另訊、外棉市價、紐約棉市、市况靜寂、因無重要之買戶、及現貨商、海外棉商在市上拋賣、結果收盤價格較之上日跌落五六八九磅音不等、印度棉市、昨日連同預測跌落八羅比之巨、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、日來始終靜寂異常、滙兌雖形緊縮、原棉交易並未活躍、祇同業間之心思較形堅定耳、然洋行方面之售價、按照滙兌結算、彼等之售價、故較之一般同業者為巨、茲將昨棉市、以美滙五元〇六二五折合期貨送廠價如下</p>
<p>二十支　美米特林　二三·九〇</p>

<h3>疋頭　棉布底豐厚</h3>
<p>布市先漲　回、蓋邇來布價轉機、本街客幫伺機落手、成交數量、頗為可觀、惟市上存底殊豐、仍有供過於求之勢、故售盤欲漲無力、然較之週前、市面已帶緊一步、白貨粗細布斜紋漲一角至二角半、色布漲二角半至五角、夏令淺色貨以銷令短促、售盤大都鬆廉、本街染廠及批發號成交坯布·府綢·色布·漂布等貨五六萬疋、浙路溫·甬幫辦粗布·斜紋·色布等貨二百餘件、北路烟·津幫辦藍布·漂布·綫呢等貨近百件、粵滇幫辦藍布·色斜·印花貨一百數十件、五日疋　運香港二百二十五件、運新加坡五十五件、</p>
<h3>糧食　洋米一哄　旋卽疲落</h3>
<p>昨日上午米市、　盪特甚、先後一升一降、計有二元之巨結果仍無榮辱、晨間開市、承上日午後漲風、心思殊堅、內地　紹甬等帮及鄉莊客戶即在多方搜求、洋米買氣旺盛、節節上騰、繼聞金價高漲至六千六百元之訊、一般投機家更復從中推波助瀾、吸收不已、頓覺滿市夙雨、形勢愈混、喊聲狂飛、一號陳西貢竟達五十七元、二號五十四元半、火絞五十五元半、二號　　五十四元、小絞五十三元半、東京砶尖五十三元、但亂哄亂嚷、恁你信口開河、而市有準則、若斯無限制之高漲、人心未免亦多顧忌、致前價既未實現、而銷場反見挫折、束手觀望、於是市面之變化立起、頓見出多進少、市貨充斥、轉現軟勢、再兼一般客販、屆此節邊、急需銀根者、紛紛甩脫、霎時間驟降二元之砠、迄午市收盤、各色洋米價已悉與前市相仿、午後各方進胃仍淡、市乃續見趨軟、二號　　自五十三元半降至五十二元左右、小絞自五十三元小至五十一元半、二號西貢五十四元四角小至五十三元、收市形勢仍軟、因暹米尚有電洽外、小絞米報價六十一元、昨有六十元還價四千　電訂、倘能成議、則後市尚須趨落云、</p>
<p>洋米昨又到滬、係怡和洋行永生輪、自香港裝來、計六千二百六十包、停靠法租界羅斯福碼頭起卸、</p>
<p>厚薄粳等國米、昨日內地無到、而場外暗盤、傳聞因節日一轟太高、特粳將近六十元大關、一般作客對於門售感難推銷、交易頓减、形勢反覺疲軟、常帮無錫特清粳五十八九元、常崑粳特自五十七八元、次至五十五六元、青泗厚薄五十五六元、南港早稻五十五元半至五十五元云、</p>
<p>糯米在早市洋米　初之際、人心亦佳、喊聲並猛、　金溧特元曾喊五十元、但後未能做開、且以他貨回疲、　隨特懈、所以結果實　價亦守原盤、無甚軒輊、計金溧特元仍為四十七元、常丹白元四十五六元、江北白元四十三四元、</p>
<h3>粉廠限制　供應客銷</h3>
<p>粉市續形堅俏　查、一號粉廠盤、仍為十三元八角、　於客盤則逐見俏　、雖有十五元七角半之高價、尚且限制供應、聞南北洋帮均有零星裝辦、本街零批交易、亦屬有增無减、盡以目下內地粉存到兩枯、順風牌已開過十三元八角、尚鮮售出、老車牌回籠貨、亦見少出、市面之緊俏、實　於新麥來源、發生問題、雖在籌措補救辦法、迄無通運端倪、</p>
<h3>雜糧　閩幫動辦　新蠶豆　黃豆市勢挺進</h3>
<p>新蠶豆　來源不湧、交易多在場外談判、聞上日所到之嘉定白皮蠶豆、及　行青皮蠶豆、均在隔昨晚上做開、由厦門泉州幫採辦、白皮因泥灰稍重、且北洋幫暫取觀望、故價作十九元、青皮為十九元五角、昨日本街問津白皮一百五十餘包、價為十九元十七元半、廣幫本街分取青皮白餘包、　行為二十元、北港為二十元零八角、黃豆一致向上邁進、榨油廠銷場因油價騰躍、豆餅俏俐非常、故不論日華商均有殷切辦胃、本街出口囤戶益　烈、但買氣熾盛、賣戶見缺、成交反呈减色、結果共祗做開各豆四千餘包云、</p>
<p>豆子五日出口、運香港一百八十九包、運新加坡七百八十包生油運香港五百聽、</p>
<h3>糖市　洋糖結果微漲</h3>
<p>昨糖市趨勢仍緊、公會　盤、初堅後軟、現貨二四粗白本棧貨上午曾到七十五元、下午四至七十三元八角、與前日上午尚漲一元八角、外棧貨上午漲元許、初為七十四元四角至七角、後為二角、下午回鬆為七十三元半、比前日僅　一角、轉口現貨初為六十元三角至六十元、後為五十九元、升半元、十四號打棧單為六十一元二角至六十元、升元許、太古車白B嘜八十五元三角、升一元三角、H嘜車赤六十元、荷赤六十二元、升一元、本廠雪白七十四元半、升二元半、一號冰九十六元、晶明冰九十七元半、升三元半、國糖有建帮開出日輪到　青二百五十包、六十三元、升半元、</p>

<h3>愛情的日新月異</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士姚崇培　性病專科醫師詹念曾合著</p>
<p>（診所）北京路四川路口中國信託公司二樓</p>
<p>（時間）上午十時至下午六時　星期日休息</p>
<p>男子精力即有繼續不斷增强的必要……</p>
<p>雖然說：朝秦暮楚，無論男子或女人都不應該這樣子的做。但喜新厭舊却是人之常情。所以聰明的妻子，她一定會隨時地改變着她的服飾，裝扮，以及家庭裏的佈置，陳設，有時或竟至連他們在愛情生活中所用的術語，姿態，言容笑貌……都換上一套新花樣，來博得丈夫的歡心。誠有這樣聰明而美妙的妻子，做丈夫者是多麽的幸福呢！</p>
<p>因為人情的喜新厭舊，愛情是需要日新月異地的。若老是這麽一套，呆板妻子的丈夫，恐怕就要喊出「家花那有野花香」的情調了！這是在女子一方面說，若在男子方面說：男子在夫婦愛情中實處於主動的地位，尤其是有着摩登夫人的時代丈夫，妻子在用着她愛的技巧，而丈夫不能與之相和，使愛情生活歡暢協調，這是最惹妻子憎惡的。然丈夫欲使夫婦間愛情生活美滿，除需要愛的技巧外，尤需要身體的健壯與精力的豐足，然後夫婦生活才能如膠似漆，朝歡暮樂，生育着伶俐的子女，組織着快樂的家庭，這是何等的幸福！可是男子若於早年犯有自凟遺精，或荒淫縱慾，虧損了生殖腺內分泌液，則凡陽痿，發育不全，精力渙散，神經衰弱，精薄不育，未老先衰等症，卽相繼叢生，此種病夫，恐越有嬌妻美妾，在愛情生活中越是弄巧成拙，或竟完全不能人道，使夫婦成掛名的關係，長此以往，使她蹉跎青春，犧牲人生幸福，這怎能不引起她的憎恨，而演出私奔離婚等種種的家庭悲劇呢？</p>
<p>愛情在日新月異地前進，男子精力卽有繼續不斷增强的必要。萬一男子已有上述症象，則須當機立斷，以根治其暗疾，千萬不可因循苟且致自誤而復誤人！上述症象的治療方法，世界名醫均推崇服生殖腺互製劑「生殖互」最為對症特效。因此劑係根據近代醫學上最進步的補給療法之原理，由雄壯動物如猿猴，猩猩，虎狼，熊鹿，海狗等體中提取其生殖腺內分泌精華，用科學複製法精製成劑，所以品質之貴重，功效之確實，實為任何類似製劑所不及其萬一。所以男子於服後一日夜間卽可生精補腎，健腦活血，繼續連服，則更助長發育，滋養神經，調整新陳代謝，必於短期內根治各症。使精力强壯，愛情美滿。惟有遺精者，須兼服「希米脫氏固精片」（中西五洲華美太和等大藥房均售）以固精關，制止遺洩，收效尤速</p>
<p>健美</p>
<h3>乳峯是幸福的泉源</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士姚崇培</p>
<p>蘭湯浴罷出晚遊，</p>
<p>窈窕豐姿超凡儔，</p>
<p>雙蜂隱約肌理顯，</p>
<p>引得路人盡回眸。</p>
<p>依着極輕薄的服裝，輪廓是這樣的曼妙，曲線是那麽明朗，更兼胸前的一對乳峯，在薄薄的衣襟里一聳一聳，他也要噴噴豔羨，私心愛慕不已。所以愛美的確是人類的天性，無論他怎樣的愚蠢，可是看到健美的少婦，特徵發達的健美女郎，在高唱女子須有「健康美」的今日，她們好像天上的安琪兒，又好像社會中的環實，人人對她表示尊敬與愛護，因此她們出入交際場中，不但佔盡了種種便宜，就是在家庭里，說得廣泛點，無論在那種場合，她們物質上與精神上都得到充分的享受與愉快。</p>
<p>可是話又要說回來了，『健美』兩字不是個個女性所得共有，倘過去曾犯束胸自凟，月經不調，白帶淋漓，貧血咯血，重症淹纏等等，則生殖腺卵巢機能遭遇摧殘，影響新陳代謝作用，乳峯便不能得良好之發育，卽已有良好之發育者。至此亦必漸漸萎　下去，馴至平坦得一似男子。同時臀部亦心瘦削無肉，失圓潤豐腴狀態，要知女性之可愛，說得明白點，全在一對乳峯與臀部，倘乳部平坦得而似男子，則尚有何美感使人顛倒溺愛乎？所以健美喪失的女郎，雖過去幸福無量，但其結果，往往悽慘得不堪問了。至於補救之法，中西醫師咸一致公認以服女用『生殖素』最為對症而特效。蓋本劑為德國斯丹那博士所發明，成分之高貴，配製之精密，為任何內分泌製劑所不逮，故一經進服，卽能在廿四小時內發揮强大藥力，調整月經，發育乳腺，倘繼續服用，必可統治上述各症，使乳峯隆然高聳，紅潤面頰，長駐青春。</p>
<h3>遺精症的特效療法</h3>
<p>— 性病專科醫師詹念曾</p>
<p>有人說：青年男子遺精並不是病。更有人說，遺精雖是病，但這種病很難治。因為有這兩種錯誤的觀念，存在遺精青年的腦中，就貽誤了不知多少青年前途！遺精不是病，但可送人命！某專家醫師曾在實騐報告中說：『遺精一次，甚於失血一磅』其嚴重性有如此者，那末，遺精恐非與普通病可比，簡直是最利害的病了。然遺精雖為最利害的病，但並不是難治的病。普通人之所以稱遺精為難治者，蓋未明遺精之病根所在，又無特效藥物可用之故。據我們調查所得，遺精青年為一般庸醫愚弄，喪時費錢，而又貽誤治療機會者，真不知凡幾？其結果，遺精日漸增多，神經益形衰弱，凡腦衰健忘，失眠心悸，腰酸背痛，發育不全，未老先衰等症象叢生，於是葬送了青春，躭誤了前程，豈不悲慘？</p>
<p>考青年人之所以患遺精症，大半因曾犯自凟縱慾，或憂勞過度，　傷了性神經，使精關鬆弛之故，能明此　結所在，故於治療上必須謀所以鞏固精關之道。則服『希米脫氏固精片』卽具有鞏固精關，寗神止遺之特效。依余之經騐，採用此劑治愈遺精患者，已不下數萬人矣。惟遺精已久有上述症象者，須兼服生殖腺素製劑『生殖素』以培補腦腎，精血，神經……連服一月，必可使百病霍然，而精力倍增豐足。這實是治標與治本並用的遺精最特效的療法。患者如在本埠能親來本診所診治者，則亦尤為可靠，計日見功。</p>
<h3>鐵一般的事實</h3>
<p>— 性病專科醫師詹念曾錄</p>
<p>（一）　遺精青年莫因循自誤</p>
<p>喬榮祖君，年二十歲，寗波人，為家鄉常遭轟炸，客歲來滬，寄宿於本埠某中學肄業。但滬地環境過於淫靡，校中又無良好之訓育設施，寄宿學生常可以出外閒遊，曾有一次為妓拉去，因時興淫念，或犯自凟，詎知自凟一犯，極易成癖，致精關鬆弛，爆發遺精症，初時每月不過二三次，繼漸增至五六次十數次，於是面黃肌瘦，記憶不良，腦昏頭痛，耳鳴耳花，四肢疲憊，腰酸背痛等症象叢生，校中功課因此亦一落千丈，春假前考試未能及格，喬君此至，乃覺悟自凟遺精之為害，然屢服市上成藥，均鮮效果，上月初始來本診所診治，欲決心治愈其病症，由專家醫師詳細診察其病狀後，知確係由遺精失治之故，即囑其赴中西大藥房購治遺特效藥「希米脫氏固精片」兩匣，及生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」兩打，使之兼服，並間日施用「迭門氏」電療術，經三星期之悉心治療，頃已精神振足，頭腦清明，上述症象已完全霍然矣。</p>
<p>（二）　結婚後丈夫的悲哀</p>
<p>高明君，年廿六，於去年冬間結婚，夫婦間從未能融洽，因高君於婚後發現陽痿症，且略有遺精，夫婦感情惡劣異常，然高君內心中之痛苦又豈能以言語形容，雖曾服市上所謂「補腎生精內分泌劑」甚少效果，心益懊喪！上月因其友介紹（其友顧君亦曾在本診所治愈其暗疾者）親至本診所診治，經察知其病狀後，卽囑其購生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」三打，「希米脫氏固精片」一盒，使之兼服，并每日施用電療注射等新醫術，一月於茲，頃已精强力壯，夫婦愛情不勝　綣云·</p>

<p>法租界納稅華人會、鑒於界內居民生活艱難、昨特致函法租界公董局、對下月起實行加捐事、請冉予以考慮、并籲請抑平物價、對於非法增加房租、亦曾議決、推選代表四人、負責進行、與當局接洽、藉以安定界內民生、茲探得各情誌后、</p>
<p>普通加捐力有未逮</p>
<p>法租界公董局、爲平衡預算、定七月一日起、增加地捐·房捐·車捐等、藉資挹注、惟際此時期、生活維艱、各納稅人殊有不克勝任之憾、法租界納稅華人會除請該局華董另行據理交涉外、昨特函致公董局、請予考慮、原函略稱、敬啟者、茲悉貴局擬自本年七月一日起、對於各項捐稅如地捐·房捐·車輛執照等實行普遍加捐、其增加比率、最高竟達百分之四十以上、實開罕見先例、溯自戰事西移、滬凟形成孤島、我法租界侷處一隅、居民驟增、各項營業、雖現欣榮之象、然試考察整個社會狀况、實有漸趨乾涸之虞、民不聊生、深堪隱憂、查此次加捐、地捐房捐之增加比率特鉅、房東方面、勢必以此藉口益行加租、際此時期、租戶當然難以勝任、於是加租糾紛、又將繼續演進、不寗惟是、萬一因加捐而激成物價之再行抬高、不特與抑平物價原則、背道而馳、租界內治安、亦恐難免不受影響、况查貴局歷屆決算、年有盈餘、此次增稅、似屬無需、開源固爲要圖、節流亦不容緩、謹陳微末、尚希貴局以民生爲重、再予熟慮之、用特函達、即祈查復爲荷、</p>
<p>籲請限制非法加租</p>
<p>法租界納稅華人會、鑒於界內業主增加房租之舉、迭有發生、而市民僉因物價飛漲、不勝負担、因此糾紛迭起、該會各委員迭經討論、業已獲有結果、由該會推選代表四人、負責向法當局接洽、限制非法加租、此四代表、爲業主兩人、及房客兩人、藉由雙方研究、獲得一公尤辦法、使一般趁火打刦之徒、無從藉口、該代表昨巳經決定者、計業主方面之一人由徐懋棠氏祖任、其餘業主方面一人及房客方面二人、則尚在物色中、</p>
<h3>紗號倒閉鷺起　達九十家　已清理者三十家　未宣佈者六十家</h3>
<p>棉紗黑市投機猖獗、紗價劇變、以致多家虧本倒閉、至昨日續有仁德·愼餘·鼎隆·三家宜告停業淸理、隱憂未艾、</p>
<p>滬戰以後</p>
<p>紗業廠商、初爲便利買賣現貨起見、曾由紗業公會之業務研究會、組成茶會形式暗市、專門經營現貨交易、確遵政府命令、不營期貨、詎歷時未久、竟有紗業敗類、利用時機、非法組成所謂「居間執中社、」立、將現貨組織、變成非法之期貨交易市塲、且買賣日本紗貨、誘致外界參加者、竟有三百家以上、未正式加入而附以別家牌號人該市塲買賣者、亦有</p>
<p>四五百家</p>
<p>之多，該市塲中持者祗顧私利、而不顧國法民生、事經財政經濟兩部迭次令禁買賣期貨與日紗、乃若輩竟置若罔聞、仍照常營業、且變本加厲、放縱盲目投機、紊亂市面、並有某大紗號操縱投機、因之造成自殺傾家蕩產者、不可勝計、上月紗價由八百元躍至一千八百元、嗣又跌至一千二百元、</p>
<p>各多空頭</p>
<p>均蒙鉅大損失、故延至目前倒閉　起，據悉業經宣布淸理者、約有三十家之譜、至未經宣佈淸理者、尚有六十家左右、此均爲買賣日紗失敗者、且均非紗布交易所原有之正當紗商、此次失敗倒閉者、　上月以日紗「月琴」爲投機目標者、平均每家投機「月琴」日紗約達三千包之鉅、又悉各該倒閉紗號</p>
<p>所負債務</p>
<p>數額、自五六萬元起至二三十萬元不等、甚至亦有負債數百萬元者、就中確係虧累倒閉者有之、而故意乘機倒閉者、亦大有人在，</p>
<h3>英軍捕獲兩歹徒　抄出重要文件　現正研究文件槍械　或將有驚人之揭露</h3>
<p>字林西報云、昨日（三日）上午九時十分、英軍東塞萊聯軍第二大隊巡暹兵一隊、沿億定盤路前行、忽有不穿任何制服之持械華人一羣、見巡邏隊行近、四散逃逸、惟有兩人被英兵捕獲、其一</p>
<p>持搶攜彈</p>
<p>並在身畔抄出或有重大關係之文件若干、　現英軍當局仍將兩人扣留　並與公共租界警務處進行偵查中、又英文大美晚　云、公共租界警務處今州四日）晨繼續研究英兵抄獲之槍械及文件、詳情未悉、據某警官稱、抄獲之槍械、非一時所能查明、而文件亦須數日</p>
<p>如能譯畢</p>
<p>云、警務方面偵查未竣、故不發喪消息、一說該被捕兩人、或輿秘密政治圖　有關、今遵捕獲、將有潤人之揭　云、現兩人仍遭東塞萊隊拘禁、預料即將移交警務處、解法院審問、</p>
<h3>錫滬公路橋樑　已燒壞十三座　新四軍在常熟一帶行動　白橋工程浩大難修復</h3>
<p>據新近由鄉間來人談、錫滬公路之常熟段、巳爲新四軍作極度之破壞、燒毀橋樑大小達十三座之多、現該路交通停止、已達四日、短時間內難望恢復常態、緣自錫滬公路淪陷日手後、即賴爲運兵交通要道、日人經營之「華中鐵道司」亦開放車輛、往來於蘇錫滬常之間、獲利殊豐、</p>
<p>蘇常一段</p>
<p>曾經游擊隊屢度破壞、卒被日軍將河道阻塞、改爲泥壩、勉强行駛、最近新四軍方面、獲悉日軍將有大批調動、乃於本月一日夜、由西面派遣流動步隊、將常熟段之橋樑、大量破壞、計自支塘之六十二號橋起、至古里村之四十九號橋止、全部燒毀、焚燒</p>
<p>達一畫一</p>
<p>附近之支塘鎭，雖駐有日軍、但因華軍有計劃之行動、該日軍咸不敢出擊、及至翌日中午，始出外强迫鄉民將火勢灌熄、事出之後、沿綫如支塘·白茆·直塘·窰鎭·一帶居民、鑒於此種狀態、恐將引起戰鬥、紛粉遷移、旋悉華軍目的、在破壞日軍之交通綫、故於事成之後、仍</p>
<p>向西引退</p>
<p>日軍爲維持運輸、急須將該毀壞橋棵趕修、惟其中有白　橋一座、工程浩大、河流又因有潮汎關係、不易用泥阻塞、預計至少須二月之久、現「華中鐵道公司」之載客汽車、巳告停止、至於華人經營之滬常各運輸公司、均經改道運輸貨物、</p>
<h3>安全運動　協力推行</h3>
<p>工部局因戰後滬市人口激增、馬路車輛、往返頻繁、爲求減少車輛肇禍之不宰事件起見、曾於去年六月十八至廿四日發起安全運動宣傳周、而過去一年中、　　事件得以說減、爲此特定本月十八日起、繼續聯台法租界當局舉行安全宣傳、其組織分營華汽車組·自備汽車組·機車組·電汽車組·人力車組·推請各方負責人士、分任指導各該組推行工作、工部局車務處及警務處並聯合訂定宜傳方式、屆時除在車輛上馬路電桿上、張貼標語傳單外、並決演映電影、及播音宜傳、及策動童子軍在各馬路指導行人交通、</p>
<h3>乍配林等　捐助比紅會</h3>
<p>比國紅十字會、在華募捐、截至最近止、巳募集華幣一一六、三八三·五〇元、內上海郵政局長乍配林捐洋一百元、法租界巡捕房總監法潑捐一百元、另收外幣捐款計比幣一二七、六八一·二五佛郞、法金三、五〇〇法郎、英金卅九鎊一便士、美金六九五元、</p>
<h3>薛耕莘　辭職照準</h3>
<p>法警務處政事部繙譯主任兼督察長薜耕莘、因積勞致疾、臥病醫院巳達月餘、茲以亟須休養、故已呈請辭職、業經准許辭退、</p>
<h3>江海關港務課　疏浚黃浦水道　先在陳家嘴一帶分兩步進行　規定施行工程區域航行辦法</h3>
<p>江海關鑒於浦江水道亟待疏濬、以利航行交通、已由港務課派挖泥船海虎號、於昨日起疏濬陳家嘴一帶主要水道、茲錄其布告云、查濬浦局挖泥船海虎號、將於浦江主要水道、陳家嘴一帶施行疏濬工作、從東溝浮（高橋沙新水道第六浮）下游約三千八百英尺處起、至東溝浮上游約二千二百英尺處止、</p>
<p>此項疏濬</p>
<p>工程、定於本年六月四日開始工作、分兩步進行、第一步在上述區域內之上海江岸一面、由下端向上游疏濬、第二步則在浦東江岸一面、亦由下端向上游疏濬、該挖泥船當工作休息時、分別在上述區域、靠上海或浦東之深水道內停泊、在此項工程進行之際、浦江內駕駛輪船之船員、於駛近挖泥船時、應</p>
<p>極端慎重</p>
<p>於可能範圍內、用極緩之速率、保持安全、並應長鳴汽笛一聲、俾該挖泥船船主、得斟酌情形、停止挖泥船向側面行動、至本課前於民國二十一年八月二十五日第十號佈告內、所示挖泥船工作信號、務須注意、此次除用前項信號外、並於挖泥船之首尾兩端、各懸告白牌一面、標明挖泥船字樣、夜間並用燈光以便照着、此外各航行人員、尤</p>
<p>不可忽視</p>
<p>者、在挖泥船　近水道之一邊、有側面錨練兩隻、因之往來船隻、距離挖泥船、不宜過近、又在挖泥船近處、駛近船隻、後船不得追越前船、或駛過對面開來之船、再此項挖泥工程圖樣、可向本課及領港公會、或濬浦局工程處索閱、仰各航商人等、一體周知、持此佈告、</p>

<h3>寗波紹興兩同鄉會　會商救濟米荒　滬甬輪仍擬增徵水腳　石契亢旱收成已絕望</h3>
<p>寗波旅滬同鄉會、爲勸募甬屬平糶捐款、由主席委員會虞洽卿·秦潤鄉·張繼先等、定於本月七日召集同鄉勸寡大會、昨發通告云、吾甬地狹人稠、食糧向感不敷、近因米源枯竭、頓告恐慌、上月中旬米價竟飛漲至六十餘元、尚無慮購買、升斗小民、勢難爲生、且當今春播種時期、雨澤稀少、早禾大都枯萎、人心惶惶、不可終日、誼關桑梓、休戚與共、除由本會積極籌措運米接濟、舉辦平糶外、惟茲事體大、端賴羣策羣力、方克有濟、茲特定於本月七日下午新鐘點五時、在本會舉行勸募大會、凡我同鄉熱心人士、一致踴躍參加、共襄義舉、無任感禱、</p>
<p>輪運水腳仍擬加徵</p>
<p>寗波民食救濟會鑒於米荒嚴重、擬依照海關估價、對進出口貨及進口在棧未提各貨、一律徵收百分之五救濟費、旋因旅滬同鄉堅決反對、乃決定改爲滬甬輪船來回增加水脚百分之五十、藉以救濟、曾由該地商會函滬虞洽卿徵求意見、當時虞氏即函復不予贊同、主張多慕捐款、並由上海先墊五十萬元、向港訂購洋米一萬八千包、裝格蘭輪由港直放寗波、同時並決定步驟、預備分二步訂米共十萬包救濟、茲經新聲社記者向航業界探悉、寗波民食救濟會乃擬自本月六日起實行進出口輪船一律徵收救濟費、依照水脚附加白分之五十、以充救濟民食之需、</p>
<p>運米接濟紹興平民</p>
<p>紹興七縣旅滬同鄉會、前因由紹地人氏託辦洋米運紹接濟、該會即籌集款項、向滬地購得大量貢米裝輪運往、共計三千九百九十六包、除一千九百九十包已分別抵達目的地外、其餘二千包、即於今日可抵甬該會已派定人員赴甬、轉運紹地、又一千五百包尚在採辦中、日內或可啟運、惟各該米糧運費損耗、皆由該會分半負担、聞浙省府已向江西台州兩地、採辦大量國米、運紹放賑、紹興上虞兩地、缺米爲最、</p>
<p>甬屬推行集團購米</p>
<p>寗波旅滬同鄉會昨開平　勸募委員會總幹事會議、柳良材提議電請甬屬各商會勸令各業積極推行集團購米、俾來源　實、糧價得以抑平、並勸各業儘量訂購、至少就各該號所需半年食糧、以資調節、衆通過、巳於今日電致甬屬各縣商會矣、</p>
<p>石契派員來滬募款</p>
<p>寗波各鄉、此次　生米荒、致搶米風潮繼起、鄉民以糠粃果腹、懷慘情形、迭誌本報、茲聞寗波西南鄉、石碶鎮所馬各鄉、米荒尤爲嚴重、最近更以亢旱、田成龜裂、收成絕望、人心惶惶、不可終日、該鎭鎭長陳曉麓力謀救濟、特於前日來滬、勸募捐款、購米運甬平糶、又聞近日旅滬鄉人、及各界熱心公益人士、自動捐助者、頗不乏人云、</p>
<h3>法租界麵包商　抬價罰鋝</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報云、法租界物價平準委員會及法警務處代表組成之委員會、昨（三日）赴若干麵包店及日用品商店調查、發覺內有數店在已往一月來、乘法幣低落　抬高物價、乃分處罰鍰、</p>
<h3>美巡洋艦大理石號　有駛滬訊</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報云、聞美國亞洲艦隊輕巡洋艦大理石號、可望於下週間從馬尼刺駛抵上海、惟本市海軍界未能證實此說、因美艦行動之消息、目下皆在四十八小時內始發出也、又聞美亞洲艦隊旗艦奧古斯泰號、將於六月十二日駛往秦皇島、　赴長江各口岸之美艦依沙佩爾號、定九日返滬、或將隨同奧古斯泰號北駛、</p>
<h3>英遠東艦隊司令易人　由李頓少將繼任　諾貝爾上將奉調返英　李氏定於九月初履新</h3>
<p>英駐遠東艦隊司令諾貝爾上將、自於一九三八年二月就職後、駐遠東服務、巳歷兩年餘、（根據英海軍司令外任期間原定任期爲兩年、但有時因環境關係、亦可延長任期）、茲據可靠消息、諾氏已奉調返英、另有重要任務、所遺遠東艦隊司令一職、由英當局另委李頓少將繼任、李氏已定下月十日、在防决就新職、幷定八月一日、由歐前來遠東、約九月初可抵港履新、按李氏於二次歐戰爆發時、駐防於地中海、此次被任新職、亦在地中海防决奉到任命、至李氏刻在地中海與吾、則尚不可知、因在戰事期間、海軍入員之行踪、均嚴守秘密也、</p>
<h3>本埠英僑　待命從戒</h3>
<p>英大使館通告歐戰發生以來、本埠英國年壯力强僑民之返國參戰者、極爲踴躍、而其他英僑、無分老幼男女、激於愛國熱忱、願爲國家服務者、情緒亦頗高漲，昨據本埠英國大使館發表消息云、「歐戰發生以還、英政府曾授權英大使、通知該國僑民、凡願返英參戰者、可先儘量在英各自治領地、發揮其愛國熱忱、或在各僑民現處之地域、代表英王之利益、作更佳之服務、日來歐戰遂漸擴大、本埠英國總領事又向政府表示僑民願返國在任何方面參加服務、幷詢問政府如不便安排此等義勇隊返英、是否反對本埠舉軟、以供彼等達到目的、現英政府已由英大使館轉交來電、答稱對於徵用遠處英僑、政府正在考慮中、對於當地舉款以供英僑返國、則無異議、但上船返國前、須再等來電指示、」</p>
<h3>法租界　徵火柴稅</h3>
<p>捲烟稅亦派員監收法國總領事署、近來發出命令徵收法租界內之化學火柴統稅、凡化學火柴廠之設在法租界者、無論其爲華人或外僑所辦、均須繳納統稅、其稅率甲等小盒火柴每箱繳納稅八元、乙等中盒火柴、每箱繳稅九元、丙等大盒火柴、每箱繳稅十六元、（每箱約共七千二百盒）此項統稅、聞係就廠徵收、不日即將見諸實施、而法租界所屬之捲烟統稅檢查處、亦當每廠派員一名、以實行監察之責、至其徵稅之法、則由法公董局捐務處發售印花票、貼於箱上爲證、如箱上未貼印花者、認爲私貨、須處以原稅額稅額二倍以上三十倍以下之罰金、並將另處以五元至五百元之罰鍰、</p>
<h3>日商「市場」載運腌豬　突遭民船械卻　押貨日人被毆受傷　讓權奪利案情嚴重</h3>
<p>社聞社云、前日（三日）下午四時許、　口吳淞路六十一號日商「上海食品市塲」日職員五名、押帶監豬三百叟、乘坐小船、挺至浦東公共碼頭、不料突來小川三艘、載有持帶鐵棍等武器之男子二百餘人、將該日商豬船包圍、並將押豬之日人五名擊傷、一聲呼嘯、立即遠遁、事後經日方得訊、立往追捕、已杳無踪跡、當將傷者車送老靶子路木原醫院、日方因查得來襲之船隻、上懸「中央市塲」旗幟、故已在嚴查真相云、</p>
<p>聚眾攔劫</p>
<p>六中社云、前　日（三日）下午　四時、吳淞　　日商「上海食料品市塲』運輸組長大淵勇藏·及其組員普久原朝吉·神田義二、野田龍美·海津高則等、由浦東運醃猪三百頭、擬至公共碼頭卸貨、不料距碼頭約三百公尺時、突有懸掛偽「中央市塲」旗幟之民船三隻，由蘇州河駛出、包圍該醃猪船、當有華人約二百名、各執鐵器、向大淵等攻擊、將醃猪三百頭全數搶完後、復向蘇州河上游逃去、聞大淵等受傷甚重、但無性命之虞、正在老靶子路太原醫院調治中、</p>
<p>已非一次</p>
<p>據悉浦江中搶貨事件、已非一次、約一個月前、曾連　發生搶猪及　他貨物情事、本月二日上午十時、某船爲『上海食料品市塲』搬運醃猪之際、曾有人加以威脅、令其開往滙山碼頭、惟已往各案、從無此次情形之嚴重、聞此次被搶醃猪、價値不下十五六萬元、</p>
<p>日人談話</p>
<p>此次事件發生</p>
<p>後、大淵曾發月餘來、本「市塲」運貨船、途中往往遇自稱「中央市塲」所派之華人、謂該貨爲「中央市塲」者、令往匯山碼頭停泊、查本「市塲」與「中央市塲」之間、並無交易關係、該「市塲」亦即無與本「市塲」糾萬之理由，此次事件、想係海賊船　懸「中央市塲」旗幟、至於是否「中央市塲」之員工所爲、在當局未調查明白以前、實　推測云云、</p>
<h3>今春蘋果進口　數量驚人</h3>
<p>纍纍然銷行於上海市上之蘋菓、大部來自日本及朝鮮、據大通社記者昨向江海關查　數字、至爲可觀、查本年一月至三月、蘋菓之進口數値、二三九·九七八海關金單位、折合國幣危六十四萬九千六百二十元、去年同期間則紙一一九·七八五海關金單位、折合國幣祗二十六萬七千二百九十七元、今年幾乎超過二倍、上項蘋菓進口國別、日本佔第一位、計一三〇·九二一海關金單位、朝鮮佔第二位、計一〇三·二六〇海關金單位、美國佔第三位、計三·三六〇海關金單位、</p>
<p>實堪驚異</p>
<p>同時偽「中央　市場」庶務科長下平、亦發表談話、謂海賊船　懸「中央市塲」旗幟、襲「擊上海食料品市場」、事屬初聞、本人認為此種暴亂事件、必係不逞之徒所爲、吾人自無爲此之動機與原因、惟「中央市場」與「上海市塲」之閒、上月初旬以來、曾因醃猪交易問題、略有混亂、尚未解　、亦係事實、而此次「上海市塲」被搶之貨、又適爲醃猪、實堪奇異、所望世人不致因此而誤解耳、</p>
<p>案情推測</p>
<p>記者以此事確甚奇特、會向熟悉本埠地方情形者詢其觀感、據稱浦江中搶刦事件、雖間或有之、但若此案之大規模動作、誠屬僅見、且搶貨者不在江中分途逃逸、而仍以三船結隊回向蘇州河上游駛去、不慮事主報官追捕攔截、尤爲可怪、吾人據此判斷案情、思過半矣、</p>
<h3>爪哇　抽練壯丁</h3>
<p>華僑一批被徵入伍携銀出境限五百盾渣華郵船公司之芝巴德輪、係於荷蘭戰事發生後離南洋駛來上海、據搭乘該輪來滬之華僑稱、自荷蘭捲人漩渦、繼而荷屬東印度形勢緊張後、爪哇當局巳採取一切戰時措置、最近規定抽徵壯丁保衛地方、外僑亦在波徵之列、其辦法係每一店舖、必須抽調壯丁一名、由爪哇當局予以訓練、作必要時保衛之需要、故華僑被徵者、已不在少數、現第一批已被徵人伍、至商店營業、夜間因實行燈火管制、巳停止營業、</p>
<p>限制外僑銀出境</p>
<p>爪哇富局爲實施戰時金融管理對於外儲攜銀出境、已加限制、其限制數目、以每人荷幣五百盾爲限、多則沒收、故此次返國華僑、已不能無限制携帶荷幣出境、現當局對於瓜哇各種物品、已加統制、商店售出貨品、應予記名、以憑查考、同時評定物價、不准商人擅自高抬價格、</p>
<p>大批華僑準備返國</p>
<p>現瓜哇華僑因在外商業已受影響亦受限制、故多數華僑、均準備返國、在芝巴德以後由南洋駛來上海之芝渣連加輪、約有千餘華僑搭乘來滬、聞該輪約本月十日左右抵滬、至芝巴德輪已定六日由滬續航南洋、</p>

<h3>寗群蠶桑局條規</h3>
<p>寗群宗太守倡設蠶桑局，其條規如下，計開：一在鄞南蔡郞橋設立教導蠶桑局，分別男女二室，男室在明心寺，女室在麗山廟，各歸各處，分班學習，以杜混跡。一局中蠶師四人，蠶婦二人，以三月十七日為始，四月十七日為止，六十日中，常川住局。一葉價高低不定，現在設局教導，事属因公，有桑各業戶，各宜存急公之意，不得抬價居奇。遇蠶大眠開口，食葉浩繁之際，悉聽局中官紳，從公酌定，隨時過稱給錢，不得攙前論後，意存壟斷，致阻善舉。　一飼蠶繅絲各器具，必須應手，所謂工欲善其事，必先利其器也，現係工欲善其事，必先利其器也，現係本局在湖州擇要辦來一二，來學者有心此事，均宜細觀，便知仿製。絲車尤為要具，知養蠶而不能繅絲，此寗人之通病，其關鍵在不知造車之法。有志者於事畢之後，儘可與局中官紳商明借樣，雇工匠照此仿造。　一蠶桑以勤儉一點要，除在局委員，凖帶家丁一名，其餘粗工散夫，均由紳董隨時添僱之。</p>

<h3>生命之星（三）</h3>
<p>我們還得知道，遮沒星子使我們看不見的，不但是黑　。諸位於日中能看出星子嗎？看不出。這不是因爲星不在，乃是因爲太陽光更大的原故，我們只見陽光，不看星子。這樣，遮沒上帝，使我們看不見的，不但是　　，疾病，死亡等等，黨我們平安快樂，眼光中充滿着世上榮華富貴時，也極容易陷入這危險中，就是看不見這生命的明星。日間看　有一法，即下井向天望，我們要見這生命的明星，始終不離關我們，作我們的導師，我們得　出工夫，暫時放下世事，與他親近。還有一個意思，這「明亮的晨星，」是東昇太陽時徵兆。諸位夜間行路，覺得艱苦難行，又冷寂，又累贅，一切覺得乏味，及見東方現市晨星，則精神百倍，因你知道這黑暗而難危的夜，快過去了。明星基督在我們心中升起照耀時亦然，換言之當基督對於我們不再爲一個空名，乃爲我們一位至好的活朋友時，即爲我們疑惑，罪孽，自私，危險利死亡等黑夜過去的先兆了。我們見了晨星，覺得歡喜，這不但因爲黑夜將去，也是因爲白日將到。我們知道不一會太陽要升起照遍大地了。當明星基督照耀我們生命時，我們歡喜，這不但因爲人生一切痛苦將去，也是因爲天堂快樂日子即到，那時上帝要給我們抹去一切眼淚給我們享受永生幸福。（完）</p>

<h3>謹請原諒</h3>
<p>— 編者</p>
<p>爲張毅聲待聘事答讀者</p>
<p>第一，我先得聲明：我並不認識張毅聲，這是他的第二封來信可以證明的。不過我所以破例替他登這段義務廣吿，一方面果然是同情他的境遇，同時覺得一般公子哥兒們有了那樣優越的環境，反而以求學爲兒戲，甚至冒騙支票，在跳舞塲偷大衣等，見了有這樣可憐的學生，使他們也有所警惕。更且現在有許多學校，祇知加費，而對於獎勵學行優良學生，及優待淸寒子弟等工作，都無暇顧到，所以在「待聘」之外，我特別提出這個「要求」。</p>
<p>可是出於意外的，並使我爲難的，希望同登「待聘」之例的來信來了許多，有的並先下手爲强，說我一定不會厚於此而薄於彼；有的懷疑張毅聲是我的親戚朋友，否則不會如此「起勁」吧？不問這些話是「請將」還是「激將」，我都十分同情他們，因爲他們是希望在這生活程度高漲的壓迫下求得一個職位，可是我實在不能在現在狹小的篇幅中再添闢自我介紹」一欄。至於有些來函中，還有偏激的話，我也完全接受，因爲怪我自己已「多事」。</p>
<p>一切尙祈原諒，恕不一一函覆了。</p>
<h3>一個小生命的死亡</h3>
<p>— 郭漣</p>
<p>避難造成上海表面的繁榮，我們開店的這一幢房子，住家倒佔十之七八，所以小孩也特別多，從抱在手上的起，數目大概要超過成人的總和，整天空氣裏充滿了小孩的嘈雜聲，除非天上垂下黑幕，實際是無時可以安靜。</p>
<p>今天突然異樣！太陽還還懸在高空，的十分鐘時間，失去了小孩的嘈雜。</p>
<p>在這十分鐘沒有到來之前，開始是一個胖婦人指揮她的兒女躱到我們店裏面來，並且還不許他們有一個站立在眼睛可以看見門以外東西的地方；天井裏，客堂裏，也統沒有小孩的踪跡。</p>
<p>因爲耳朶聽慣了嘈雜的聲音，這時反而感到空氣格外死寂得可怕。</p>
<p>後來才知道，因爲房子小，人家多，這兩天天氣又然起來，空氣格外窒悶，在這種情形下，樓上寗波嫂嫂家；犧牲掉一個小孩。爲的小——是拿蒲包裝出去的。這幢房子裏突然異樣的時候，正是這脫離了靈魂的小軀壳裝進一只蒲包裏預備提下樓的時候。小孩躱避的原因：據說是小孩假使看見一個死小孩，將來自己會發生「不幸」的，雖然外面還有蒲包，但是他門的父母，都鄭重地把他們藏起來，以免給他們看見，發生將來的「不幸」，因此也就造成這十分鐘死寂的空氣</p>
<p>可是這死去的小孩，爲甚麼「不幸」偏會臨到他身上，是不是他的父母在他生前忽略了而使他見過別個死小孩呢？但我可以說：吾！一百個吾……！因爲從這小生命臨到人間那天起，我記住我祇由掛在墻上的日歷上撕去了四十一頁，然而他——這小命就完結了！</p>
<p>還沒有到過大門口，那裏來的死小孩會使他見過面發生今日的「不幸」呢？</p>
<p>這生命的不幸一完全應該歸結到：房子的窄小；空氣的窒悶；尤其是父母的疎忽！因爲前兩者還可以推說到經濟方面的限制。</p>
<p>新時代的父母們，請你們不要再迷信形式吧！兒童爲中國未來的主人翁，希望你們爲父母的好好地　負起培植的責　！</p>
<h3>爲什麽要「化名」</h3>
<p>— 羽</p>
<p>讀前幾天春秋，知道有一「粒張毅聲」君寫信給本刋編者，要求他公開代爲介紹敎職，以資助下學期攻讀揚州中學學雜各費。編者很慷慨地破例了　次；不意過了二天，一編者謹覆　中又說有沈陸　君打電話給揚中，說是該校沒有「張毅聲」其人。使無窮的讀者感到惆悵。等到六月三日，張君來函，說毅聲本係化名」，故「學校當局不能通知學生」。</p>
<p>事情就這樣完結了，但我們要敬質這位一張毅聲”君，幹什麽要化名」呢？難道是怕沒有學費給人家知道嗎？難道沒有學費就算是雖爲　的事嗎？</p>
<p>我想張君因無學費而欲出勞力以使繼續求學的精神，是每個有理智的人觔應該贊揚稱頌的，決不是一件害羞的事情</p>
<p>相反的，每個有像張君那樣志願的人，應當都起來效仿（但並不是叫大家都把「春秋」當作職　介紹　，因爲事實上「春秋沒有這樣多的篇幅，而且我職業自有其別的方法），破除虛榮的觀念，爲自己打出條出路來！</p>
<h3>「留額」有贈品</h3>
<p>— 三三</p>
<p>每逢放假之前，各校爲統計下學期學生一計，例有繳　「留額金」之舉，現在自然又是時候了，某校更舉行「大贈品」，鼓勵學生及早「留額」，其辦法如下。</p>
<p>中學每人七元，小學四元，先繳者中學贈以價値二角的圖畫紙（都蓋上校章，平常所用簿籍亦如此，皆須向校中商店購買，以示整齊劃一）；小學先繳贈校中商店「代價券」一角云。</p>
<p>霍桑探案</p>
<h3>舞后的歸宿</h3>
<p>— 程小青著</p>
<p>第一章「一位挺漂亮的小姐！」</p>
<p>「安娜？包朗，我有些兒糊塗了。「百家姓」上句是有複姓安娜的嗎？」</p>
<p>我冷冷地答道：「這不是姓。這是外國女子的閨名Anna的譯音。」</p>
<p>霍桑也裝作恍然大悟地點了點頭。「晤。原來如此。那末，我委實不應當用　姑娘　」或「小姐，」應得稱呼，密司才是。對不對？」</p>
<p>安娜的眼角裏好像露出一小塊眼白，却並不答覆。</p>
<p>霍桑又說：「密司安娜－唉－對不起，我本來不應當這樣稱呼，可是沒有法子－請問密司尊姓？」</p>
<p>伊不高興地說：「姜！」</p>
<p>「哎喲，請恕我唐突，這個姓似乎不大稱配。這姜　姓是我們百家姓上本來有的中國姓啊！」</p>
<p>安娜有些不安起來了。伊的眼角裏不但露白，而且眼黑部分也漏出近乎惱怒的光彩。</p>
<p>「我不是來請你批評我的姓跟名字的，我是來託你辦一件案子的。」伊隨手將大半支紙烟丢在灰盆裏。</p>
<p>霍桑瞧著伊的頭髪，自順自地說：「這頭髮染得正好，眞像外國人的勃郞色，要是有方法可以把黑眸子染得煤油藍的話，密司姜，我倒勸你値得試一試！」</p>
<p>蘇媽走進來收拾碗碟，才把霍桑的諷刺話打斷。可是安娜並不羞窘，還祗是露著那種怨恨之色。</p>
<p>「霍先生，我是爲了一件命案來請敎你的。你怎麽拿我開玩笑？」</p>
<p>伊的語調已顯然有了變異，神態上的那股「火氣」也消退了不少。霍桑也點了點頭。</p>
<p>他說：「抱歉得很，我怎敢玩笑？這是我的一種貢獻。……唉，你說是一件命案？死的誰？」（五）</p>

<h3>卓別麟的家庭生活</h3>
<p>— 新良</p>
<p>卓別麟除了星期日的下午之外，是不很　意接見來訪的客人，因爲實在太忙的緣故。這是一個星期日，我們一起到他家裏去訪候他，他的妻子，寳蓮高黛與他的兩個兒子。</p>
<p>到達他家的時候正是中午。却利在昨晚爲了多做些工作，所以剛才起身。我們大家在會客室裏見了面。</p>
<p>會客室四面的牆壁上放滿的儘是些一流行』的文學書，其中大部份倒是題了名姓由原作者贈送給他的。</p>
<p>當我們大家携着手走上他那座房子時（築在峻峭的山上）他告訴我們他是怎樣地喜歡花朶－它們的美麗常常會使他感動。「它們的容易凋謝太使我悲傷了。』他微笑地說着。</p>
<p>當我們走了　回來時，寳蓮已經梳妝好了。她正與一只捲毛的獵狗玩着，看見我們之後，她立即衝向前來招呼我們。我曾經聽說有人用「發燐光的』這四個字來形容她，的確，是再適配也沒有了。她有一種生氣，有一種活力，她不需要化裝，她有一種曬黑的皮膚可以來吸引你。</p>
<p>她的眼睛也是挺有神的。眼眶並不大，但不時地在轉動，在跳躍，好像是與你在說話的樣子。</p>
<p>在星期日，他們吃午餐的地方大概都是在游泳池旁邊幾株大樹的蔭下。星期日，却利的兩個兒子，一個叫小却利，十三歲，一個叫雪尼，十二歲，也都從陸軍小學校中回來住在家裏。他們的體格，也是非常的强健，而且都有飽滿的精神；他們的舉動，雖然好似很粗，但是却非常可愛。在吃飯的時候，他們好像很怕難爲情，對於陌生的人客，他們連一句話都不說。這兩個孩子都很愛寳蓮，寳蓮呢，同樣地也歡喜他們，她常到他們的學校中去參覜，看比賽各種球戲，有時候，給獎的也就是她。</p>
<p>寳蓮最高興結絨綫，只要有空，她就會坐下來打結的。『噢，這原是我的嗜好呀，』她告訴我們道：『我自己穿的羊毛衫與汗衫，都是我自己編結的。在攝影塲中，當工人在排置佈景等時，我一個人就拿了副針錢結衣服。你要我編絨衫嗎？下個耶誕節時我可以送你一件。」</p>
<p>吃過了晚飯之後，我們大家重新又回到了圖書館裏來。有時候，如果我們幸運的話，準會聽得却利的親自來彈奏鋼琴，從這裏，我們又可以知道：却利非但是個演戲的天才，而且也是一個音樂的能手呢。當他感到「煩悶』時，他也喜歡高聲朗讀幾句書中的精彩的文字。</p>
<h3>歐戰上銀幕</h3>
<p>— 新方</p>
<p>歐戰的發生，使好萊塢各影片公司相當的改變了攝片的方針，一方面爲了調劑世界人士的性情，喜劇片是不可缺的；另一面爲了迎合時代的怒潮，戰爭片當然亦是需要大量來攝製的。</p>
<p>派拉蒙公司正在動議開攝一張巨片，片名「神秘的船」“Mystery　Shlp”，預備將此次北海的海戰及德國袖珍艦斯比上將號，與英國三巡洋艦作戰後在烏拉圭附近領海自沉這一幕史實，一一搬上銀幕，介紹在觀衆們的面前。</p>
<p>環球公司當局現在亦有一部關於歐國的故事編成，內容所述是最近芬蘭所發生的戰事的前後經過；這部故事已定名爲海上的巡邏隊」“Ses　Patrol”。不久後，即將分派各部工作人員。</p>
<p>米高梅公司亦有二張正當動工開拍中，一張片名“Escape”另一張爲“MortolStorm”，內容全係描寫德國境內的納粹黨情形，及今日歐戰的背面詳情。</p>
<p>附帶在這裏要報告的，是好萊塢最近又有一重大發展；預備把它們的出品，能够跟着每日的報紙在全世界人士前同樣的負起報導的責任來，照　種情形，將來總有一日，新聞事業是由電影界方面來做領導的地位呢。</p>
<h3>少年社初度演出紀</h3>
<p>— 裕</p>
<p>靑年是好動的，窒息在孤島上求學，課外活動應當和求學相兼並願。少年戲劇研究社的演出是提高青年課外活動的興趣，他們第一次的演出，就是成立的一天，是在四川路青年會。演出的劇名是富於現代性，針對著目前的社會；第一齒是「劉三爹」，寫述一個鄉下老紳士，爲着他兒子爲利引誘而出賣了一個朋友，結果那父親爲着保持他們世代淸白的家史而犧牲了一個汚穢的兒子。第二齣是『敎訓』。一個背鄉離井的女子，執敎鞭於一羣可愛的小學生中，她脫離了固執信家庭和劣的環境，悄然投向祖國後方去了。在她最後的草率中有這麽兩名：「我已把我的千元嫁妝捐費去了，捐給國五家，免我消耗恥辱…」這深刻的二句，不但對劇中人一個刺激，並且對現在處僞的入，不啻也是一個警告。那女主角流利的對白，增加了全劇的生氣不少。</p>
<p>第三齣最長，比較最能動人。劇名曰『被迫害的』。一個寗受饑餓不爲惡人做工的壯士，一個惡色圈內掙扎的女孩，一個染病在床的老人，一個被利誘志的婦人，——合成了一幕慘劇，結果；老人不能眼睜睜的見他們！一對惡勢力下的戀人受飢，去犯了法，女孩意志薄弱，不能奮鬥到底而自戕，等待殺完惡人想和他愛人到光明去的壯士回來，衹能空負了一個偉大的希望，孑然一身的匆匆往內地去了。被迫害的就如此的結了束，三幕獨慕劇也閉幕了。</p>
<p>雖然他們的佈鱟，燈光不够偉大，但是他們的演出可說是成功，並不過火，恰到好處，實能鼓勵靑年對話劇發生了好感。</p>

<p>— 海星</p>
<p>年內有出版希望周貽白執筆之一中國戲曲史」，多六十餘萬言，自元代迄今，都有批判的紀述，堪稱中國劇壇之空前佳作，戰前已有某大書局要求出版，「八一三」烽火旣起，書局以成本激增，而各地交通梗阻，銷路殊無把握，遂作罷，年來周又數度校訂，加入新資料甚多，茲聞由周越然介紹，將在商務印書館出版，分三期發行，第一期年內可以問世。</p>
<h3>正告播音電台</h3>
<p>— 瑞</p>
<p>無綫電廣播電台，在上海已有着相當的歷史和地位，當戰事未發生以前，上海全埠就有了二十多家不過那時因爲受着交通部的嚴密監視和控制，所以每個電台對於牠自已的周波都是非常的注意，而一般設備較爲簡陋的電台，是不能得到交通部的尤許而營業的。</p>
<p>但是從戰事發生以後，政府從南京遷到了重慶，上海也因此而成了特殊地方；由於人口的增加，和各業的畸形發展，所以播音台也就像雨後春筍股的成立了好多家。可是因爲環境特殊，受不到交通部控制的緣故，對於電台的周波方面不大法意，往往會和其它周波相鄰近的　台互相混雜，雖然是較好的收音機也不能把它分隔淸楚，縱有好的播音節目也使聽衆感到壓惡，這樣一來以營業爲目的的電台，將因了聽衆的减少，而减低牠播昔的效力。</p>
<p>其次，聽衆引爲憾事的，就是報告員把廣告不絕或重複的報告着，雖然，電台是以營業爲目的，廣告當然是主要營業，但是如果在播送的時候，一面唱片不過唱了三分鐘，而報告員的商業廣告，却繼續到五分鐘或甚至十分鐘，這樣不但不能增加廣告的效力，反而使牧聽的人感到　惡而不願繼續的聽下去，致使廣告的效力因之减低。所以廣告的報告必須簡要，分量不可過多，希望各電台注意才是。</p>
<p>簡訊　中國劇社的漢高祖」，預告已久，但作者費泰爲鄭重起見，曾數易原稿，到現在剛才五幕完全竣事。同時導演費穆也剛才把「孔夫子」拍完，等剪接完畢，馬上開始「漢高祖」的工作，所以外傳費穆將導演「文天祥」之說，完全不確。（二）本埠友聲國劇團團員戎樹棠許振泰二君得名師諸鼎元君之悉心指導，藝益猛晋。該團將於本月九日假座寗波同鄉會作本年度第一次彩排，我許二君亦將主演「珠　寨」，尚有組長徐通蓀君中演之御果園。此次演出，必甚美滿。（三）海上顏料富商周曾祚，昨假靜安寺路仙樂舞宮大禮堂與邱志潔女士舉行訂婚典禮由名樂隊洛平率領全體伴奏，盛極一時。仙樂佈置當麗，取費低廉，尚有冷熱氣之設備，各界均可租用。</p>

<h3>Review of the Question of Italy's Entry into the War</h3>
<p>Of all the various international problems, the question of Italy is one of the most difficult for observers to understand. The world is concerned, international researchers are exploring, and leaders of various countries are busy, especially about whether Italy will enter the war. However, if we look through the smoke, remove the branches, and examine the fundamental issues, then a very clear picture will immediately be presented to us.</p>
<p>First of all, we should point out that Italy's attitude since the declaration of war by Britain and France against Germany is, in legal terms, only a declaration of "temporary non-participation," rather than a declaration of "neutrality" in international law. In essence, its so-called "temporary non-participation" is actually a special way of participating in this unusual war. In other words, in this period from the start of the war to the present, it has used the weapon of "temporary non-participation" to participate in Germany's battle against Britain and France. How can we see this? Simply put: (1) In terms of the source, the relationship between Germany and Italy is just like that between Britain and France, there is an alliance relationship, and Italy's adoption of a non-war attitude is due to Germany's instruction and its own consent. In other words, in a whole set of double act, Germany plays the role of "war" in this period; while Italy is "non-war". (2) In terms of function, it can be divided into two points; First, Italy's non-participation in the war means that Britain and France cannot blockade the Mediterranean; and since Italy is an ally of Germany, it does not constitute international legal "neutrality", so it has no obligation not to transport military supplies and raw materials to allied countries. Therefore, Italy can be regarded as having organized a huge maritime transport team for Germany, making the only means of blockade that Britain and France regard as fatal to Germany completely ineffective. Second, in the center, after France declared war on Germany, it had to use a huge military force to guard against Italy at the same time; As the war evolves, the "participation or non-participation in the war" of Italy can be used in many places, and the power added to international politics is also extremely great. In this back and forth, is it more beneficial to Germany for Italy to participate in actual combat, or is it more beneficial to maintain the so-called "temporary non-participation"? This question involves various aspects such as military affairs and cannot be simply explained; however, according to the common conclusion of general researchers, most believe that non-participation in the war is more beneficial to Germany, especially more than participation in the war.</p>
<p>Therefore, to put it thoroughly, the question of whether Italy will participate in the war does not arise at present. The core of the current problem is only whether Italy has changed from a special form of participation in the war to an ordinary form of participation in the war; that is, whether the so-called "temporary non-participation" strategy will evolve into armed conflict?</p>
<p>If Italy's current tense appearance is only a political act, only to promote the so-called "peace offensive" that Germany is about to launch, then it will not participate in actual combat in the end. Otherwise, assuming that its demonstrated attitude does have its actual content, then the key to determining whether it will participate in actual combat lies in the attitude of Britain and France towards the Mediterranean blockade.</p>
<p>In the current situation where the war is expanding, in order to win the war against Germany, Britain and France will certainly not be able to sit idly by the phenomenon that Italy has been transporting military supplies, raw materials and other goods to Germany in the Mediterranean for the past few months. The purpose of Britain and France blocking Germany's path to the North Sea in the Norwegian war has been fully achieved. Currently, Germany has two paths, one is the Soviet Union on the mainland, and the other is the Mediterranean. Regarding blocking land routes, Britain and France have no possibility of using force, nor is it necessary. It can probably be solved through diplomatic means; as for the Bay of the Mediterranean, there are three paths that Britain and France can follow: First, regardless of Italy's reaction, forcibly blockade the Mediterranean; Second, force Italy to declare "neutrality" and then strictly implement maritime inspections: Third, force or induce Italy to provide guarantees not to supply Germany with military supplies, raw materials and other goods. None of these three are what Italy is willing to accept at present. Its only reply, according to its own claims, is to join the war; that is, it implies: since the role of "temporary non-participation" is lost, then there is no other way but to clearly remove the veil and participate in the war.</p>
<p>Therefore, if Britain and France allow the original state of the Mediterranean passage, they will not be able to carry out their strategy against Germany; if they block Germany's passage on the Mediterranean, it will prompt Italy to actually participate in the battle. These two methods are divergent paths for Britain and France to choose from. As for Italy, if it accepts the British and French methods under certain conditions when Britain and France take the second path, it is equivalent to canceling the German-Italian alliance; if it opposes the British and French methods and is loyal to the German-Italian alliance, it must go to war with Britain and France. These two methods are divergent paths for Italy to choose from. Naturally, when decision-makers make decisions, they have more or less constraints and still have some room for flexibility. However, when we comprehensively observe various factors and trends, the trend will eventually tend towards a break. The only thing in dispute is the time.</p>
<h3>Amidst the Tense Situation in Europe, Japan Harbors Ambitions towards the Dutch East Indies; Foreign Minister Arita's Blatant Expression Resembles the Self-Image of an East Asian Hegemon</h3>
<p>Tokyo. Japanese Foreign Minister Hachiro Arita said in a speech to the Pacific Society last night that unless the powers allow Japan to fully participate in the economic development of the Dutch East Indies, conflicts between Japan and other powers in East Asia will be unavoidable. Japan "cannot be indifferent" to any developments that may change the situation in the Dutch East Indies. He said, "Our concern is not only limited to maintaining the political status quo of the Dutch East Indies. Due to the resources, trade potential, and industrial possibilities of the island, it is natural for Japan to seriously care about the economic status of the East Indies. The Dutch East Indies have relations with Europe through the Netherlands, but the East Indies are located in East Asia and are surrounded by the destiny of all East Asia. No one can bear to look at the East Asian nature of the islands." Arita compared Japan's concern for the Dutch East Indies with Britain's concern for Poland and Norway and the United States' concern for the Western Hemisphere. He said that Japan cannot be indifferent to the situation in China, so we are also concerned about "the evolution of the territory south of our country." Arita did not clearly explain the southern land and criticized immigration and business restrictions, so it seemed to warn that the Philippines may have conflicts with Japan in the future. Arita claimed that Japan's foreign policy is roughly to build a new East Asian order on a stable foundation. He said, "Japan should be a stabilizing force in East Asia and should enjoy special interests in mainland China and the territory south of our country." Arita said, "In its true sense, peace and stability depend on economic mutual benefit and mutual assistance. To give an example, there are now two countries, one with a small area and no rich resources, but a very large population, and the other with a large area and rich resources, but a very small population. Imagine that these two countries have no normal trade relations and allow each other to circulate goods. In this situation, how can we hope to maintain peace and stability in this region? In addition, assuming that the flow of goods between these two countries is restricted by tariff barriers and restrictions on immigration, then conflicts between these countries will be inevitable." Although Arita did not specify what these "countries" are, listeners all believe that he is referring to the Philippines and the Dutch East Indies. Arita continued, "This principle is suitable for any situation. I believe that the crux of the Pacific disputes is indeed due to this conflict and inequality. After this war, a new world order will be established, and this new order must be based on the solution of this problem." (4th Taiwan Public Power dispatch)</p>

<p>Paris: The General Headquarters released a war bulletin this morning stating, "Enemy forces have launched fierce attacks on our positions near Dunkirk. Our troops are bravely resisting and constantly counterattacking. Our fleet, amidst enemy fire, is cooperating with the British Navy to defend the port of Dunkirk and cover the troops boarding ships from the port, with considerable success. Their brave fighting spirit is exemplary. In the Saint-Avold area, enemy forces have repeatedly attacked our outposts, but have not succeeded. They are only reinforcing their strength on the right bank of the Ena River and intensifying their attacks on our positions on the west bank of the Sa'ar River. In addition, our bomber squadrons attacked enemy positions and bombed their communication lines yesterday and today. Enemy bomber groups, escorted by many fighter planes, flew over the suburbs of Paris for the first time this afternoon, dropping bombs. They were immediately met with resistance from our fighter planes and anti-aircraft artillery, and suffered heavy damage. Most of our fighter planes are the latest models. According to initial reports, we shot down a total of seventeen enemy aircraft." (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<p>Paris: Military figures here recently stated that the battle in the Dunkirk area has been extremely fierce in the past two days. After more than twenty days of hard fighting, the Allied forces have been constantly bombed by German aircraft. With their backs to the sea, they can obtain sufficient supplies from the sea, but they have not received any reinforcements. On the German side, the number of personnel is far greater, and fresh troops are constantly being added. The differences in work and rest and the disparity in numbers are significant. However, the Allied forces have not only resisted bravely, repeatedly repelling the German forces, but also counterattacked repeatedly, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. Yesterday, the German forces besieged the Allied positions all day, but were repelled. On one occasion, they penetrated the French army</p>
<h3>Circumstances of the Fall of Lille</h3>
<p>Berlin: According to German war correspondent Xu Mi, on May 27th and 28th, German troops attacked the Darati defense line east of Lille, advancing towards Lille in three routes. The French army resisted stubbornly, leading to fierce street fighting. Finally, the French army surrendered, and German troops occupied Lille. (Haitong, 4th)</p>
<p>Berlin: A special correspondent from the German war zone broadcasted today about the chivalrous behavior of the German troops after occupying Lille. It is claimed that when the German commander occupied Lille, he issued an order allowing the French soldiers defending the city to retreat with their entire force without harm. There were three teams of French soldiers defending the city, fully armed, parading through the most prosperous area of the city, led by four French generals. Although the French soldiers had been trapped for many days and without food for several days, they still maintained the spirit of soldiers, commanding respect. Four German generals stood watching, and when the French soldiers passed in front of them, they also saluted. The German army deeply valued the French soldiers who had fought hard to defend the city. It is said that heroes cherish heroes. After the French army withdrew, a large group of prisoners followed. It is reported that these prisoners were soldiers who had fought hard near Lille for four days and surrendered after exhausting their strength. (Haitong, 4th)</p>
<p>position in one location. By dusk, the French army launched a major attack and finally repelled the German troops. By this morning, the German troops had begun to attack again. Detailed information is still unknown, but in general, the German troops have a local advantage, but the price is extremely high. The battle is fierce and unprecedented. As for other places, they are relatively calm. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<p>Paris: The French General Headquarters released a war bulletin stating, "On the Dunkirk front, our troops are resisting with all their might, despite the enemy's significant pressure, preventing the enemy from advancing. Allied troops were therefore able to retreat gradually from the port last night. As for other fronts, there is nothing major to report." (Havas, 4th)</p>
<p>London: A Reuters military correspondent learned that a large number of French troops are still fighting hard in the Dunkirk area and continuing to prepare for local counterattacks. As Allied Commander-in-Chief General Weygand is deploying a major offensive, he is preventing at least fifteen German divisions in the Dunkirk area from being transferred to other operations. The French defense line extends from the coast to the Maginot Line. Between them, apart from a few places, there are strong natural obstacles such as rivers. There is currently a 12-mile gap between the Somme and Vas Rivers, and an 18-mile gap between the Aisne and Moselle Rivers. The possibility of the German army attacking between Abbeville and Amiens must also have been taken into account, but General Weygand may not be waiting for the German attack. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<h3>British Admiralty Announces, Three More Destroyers Sunk, Twenty-Four Small Warships Lost</h3>
<p>London: The Admiralty announced that the battles of the past week can be described as one of the most difficult battles in naval history. The number of British, French, and Belgian troops safely transported back to Britain from Belgium and northern France will shock the world when detailed figures can be released. The retreat of these troops was carried out under intense and continuous air raids and artillery and machine-gun fire. Its success depended on the close cooperation of the Allied naval, land, and air forces, and the firm determination and courage of all parties involved. The British Navy participated in this military operation with several destroyer squadrons and a large number of various types of small ships. The number quickly increased to 222 British warships and 665 other British ships. The above figures do not include the French warships and merchant ships that participated. The rapid gathering of more than 600 various types of small ships was due to the voluntary participation of volunteers. They have shown great and tireless spirit. "As soon as the order to collect various types of small ships was issued, respondents from all parties came one after another, and voluntarily sent personnel to drive the ships to the gathering point. At that time, they did not know what these ships would be used for. These volunteers worked hard day and night under the most difficult conditions, and made a great contribution to the success of this military operation and the rescue of hundreds of thousands of lives. The troop withdrawal took place on the beaches in and around Dunkirk. Enemy forces constantly disrupted the process with air raids and artillery fire. The British Navy opened fire to destroy enemy artillery positions and protect the flanks of the retreating troops. Enemy submarines and high-speed motorboats were also quite active, but were all heavily damaged by the British Navy. The water there is very shallow, the strait is quite narrow, and the tide is extremely strong, making it extremely difficult for any warship to maneuver. If any ship is driven carelessly, there is a risk of blocking important straits and usable parts of the port of Dunkirk. In addition, the weather was not entirely conducive to military operations. A northwest wind blew for two days, causing many waves on the beach, slowing down work on the beach and making it more difficult. Only on one afternoon was there a dense fog, greatly reducing enemy air force activity. It is not difficult to imagine the degree of danger involved in carrying out this large-scale retreat under intense and continuous air raids. The success of the retreat was a victory for the Allied naval and air forces, preventing the enemy's most powerful air force, which took off from nearby, from doing any harm. The port of Zeebrugge has been sealed off with ships filled with cement, and the gates to the sea entrance of the canal and the hydraulic machinery have been destroyed, and the gates have also been closed. In fact, the remaining ports that have fallen into enemy hands have become useless. All the remaining fuel has been destroyed. The losses of the British Navy are relatively minor. The sinking of the destroyers Grafton, Grenade, and Wakeful Three was announced on May 30th. The destroyers Basilisk, Keith, and Havant Three have also been sunk due to enemy action. Among the other 170 small warships participating in the battle, a total of twenty-four were lost, including one naval aviation supply ship, one minesweeper, and one gunboat, five small minesweepers, eight fishing boats, and eight various types of small warships.

<p>Berlin: Yesterday, German military authorities claimed that the British battleship "Nareldi" sank as early as May 11th. (Haitong News Agency, 4th)</p>
<p>Swedish Capital: London announced yesterday that the British ship "Yongjia" had sunk. The ship displaced 1,478 tons and had a crew of twenty-two sailors, fourteen of whom are missing. (Haitong News Agency, 4th)</p>
<h3>Allied Forces in Northern Norway Surround German Troops</h3>
<p>Paris: The Norwegian Embassy here issued a communiqué stating that the Norwegian Telegraph Agency's correspondent in Narvik reported that the Norwegian, French, and Polish troops in Narvik are continuing to advance to surround the German troops. The cleanup operation in the area is currently underway. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>London: The Norwegian Telegraph Agency reported that most of Narvik has become a rubble field after seventeen German aircraft bombed it fiercely on Saturday afternoon. As a result of the high-explosive bombs and incendiary bombs that were dropped, the residential area was severely damaged, and the commercial area was almost completely destroyed. The German aircraft were eventually chased away by fighter planes, and many of the migrating aircraft were shot down. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<h3>During the Major Air Raid on Paris This Time, German Air Force Dropped Over a Thousand Bombs, Seventy-Six Fires Broke Out in the Suburbs After the Bombing, French Communiqué Claims Seventeen Enemy Aircraft Shot Down, Britain and France Will Take Retaliatory Action</h3>
<p>Paris: The Prime Minister's Office issued a communiqué stating that enemy aircraft flew over the suburbs of Paris for the first time this afternoon, dropping bombs, mostly attempting to bomb military targets, dropping over a thousand large and small bombs, killing and injuring over two hundred civilians, including forty-five deaths. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<p>Paris: When the alarm was sounded at 1:15 yesterday afternoon, the citizens of Paris were having lunch. After hearing the alarm, they quickly took cover. Within a very short time, there was no one on the streets. Anti-aircraft guns suddenly fired, and the sky was filled with white smoke. The air was shaken by the sound of anti-aircraft shells exploding and the sound of airplanes rattling. This was followed by the heavy explosion of a German plane crashing to the ground. The anti-aircraft fire continued for twenty minutes before stopping. Soon after, the sound of French fighter planes intercepting enemy planes was heard. A wisp of black smoke in the air indicated that one enemy plane had been hit and crashed. The alarm was lifted at two o'clock. Several buildings in the city caught fire after being hit by bombs, and firefighters quickly arrived at the scene to put out the fires. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>Paris: Yesterday's first group air raid on Paris by German aircraft is expected to be the prelude to a large-scale attack on this French capital. There were six large squadrons of German aircraft flying over Paris, at an altitude of about 8,000 meters. The bombing lasted from 1:15 p.m. to 2:50 p.m., dropping 10,680 bombs, 83 of which fell within the city and 977 of which fell outside the city. A total of 45 French people were killed, including 8 in the city, and a total of 149 were injured, including 54 in the city. Most of the bombs dropped were incendiary bombs, so 70 holes caught fire, 14 in the city. Eight schools were hit, one of which was hit by 15 bombs, killing 10 students and injuring 18. A temporary hospital was also hit, killing two male nurses and injuring an unknown number of people. When the alarm first sounded, thousands of employees from various offices who had just finished lunch were returning to their offices. As soon as they heard the alarm, they hurriedly left their offices to take cover. However, within three minutes, the streets were empty. As soon as the German aircraft entered the city's airspace, large squadrons of French fighter planes were waiting in formation, and the two sides fought fiercely. The citizens of Paris were deeply stimulated. According to official announcements, 17 German aircraft were shot down. (International News Agency, 4th)</p>
<p>Paris: Yesterday, a German radio station predicted that the Allied forces would take retaliatory action for yesterday's German air raid on Paris. According to a radio reporter, Germany's actions will likely be answered, and German cities and towns will have to endure the consequences of this bombing. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>German Supreme Headquarters: This afternoon's German war report stated that German fighter planes attacked French air force bases near Paris, breaking through the French air defenses, attacking French airfields and air force bases, causing fires in many places and explosions. 79 French aircraft were shot down, and no less than 300 to 400 aircraft parked on the ground were destroyed by bombs. Yesterday, German anti-aircraft guns shot down 21 enemy aircraft, and nine German aircraft were missing. Last night, enemy aircraft dropped bombs in the Netherlands and western and southern Germany, but with little effect. Near Rotterdam and in western Germany, one enemy aircraft was shot down by anti-aircraft guns, and two more were shot down by German fighter planes. (Haitong News Agency, 4th)</p>
<p>Paris: Regarding the air raid on the Paris metropolitan area, according to initial reports, the German side dispatched large bombers, capable of carrying several tons of bombs, divided into multiple batches, attacking in turns. One batch had as many as eighteen aircraft. The number of incendiary bombs and ordinary explosive bombs dropped was no less than a thousand. The scale was unprecedented. This air raid had two purposes: to destroy various military targets and to cause panic among the residents. At the time, some enemy aircraft deliberately used large bombs to bomb railway stations and airfields, while other enemy aircraft selected an area and scattered smaller bombs. Their power was not enough to destroy five- or six-story buildings. In addition, the enemy aircraft were flying at high altitude, about 7,000 to 8,000 meters above the ground. When dropping bombs, they did not fly down quickly, so few of them hit the target. Many bombs fell in the forests in the suburbs. Most of the fires that broke out in the city were quickly extinguished due to effective firefighting efforts. However, a large factory in the suburbs suffered more damage. Many of the factory's workers were killed or injured. The injured were immediately sent to nearby hospitals for treatment, while the other workers continued to work as usual. In addition, many civilian houses were hit. In the suburbs, an eight-story building had a bomb fall on the roof, going straight down to the second floor. Most of the houses in the residential areas of Paris had few intact windows. The farthest place that was bombed was about 60 kilometers from the city of Paris. Three fires broke out in the Paris metropolitan area and the southwest suburbs. Although they were quickly extinguished, the thick smoke did not dissipate and was still visible by evening. In addition, a military hospital in the suburbs was hit by 20 bombs. The main part of the hospital was destroyed, and two female nurses were killed and several others were injured. At that time, German aircraft also attacked nearby military targets. It is difficult to deny that the bombing of the hospital was intentional. A middle school in Paris was not hit and fortunately there were no deaths or injuries, only material losses. After the bombing ended, Paris returned to normal, and people from all walks of life continued to work as usual. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<p>Paris Citizens Calm, Many Schools Destroyed</p>
<p>Paris: After Paris was bombed by German troops yesterday, the citizens remained calm as usual. The residents strictly maintained order during the bombing and did not panic at all. Most of the victims (about 200 dead and injured) were careless or too adventurous, so they did not take cover in time. The number of German aircraft participating in the bombing was about 240 to 300. No fewer than a thousand bombs were dropped on Nannai, including high-explosive and incendiary bombs. As far as is currently known, at least 45 people, including one American expatriate, have now died. After the bombing, all the bombed streets were cordoned off with ropes to prevent curious citizens from gathering to view the bomb craters and collapsed houses. The streets on both sides of the Seine River were filled with rubble and shattered glass. There are countless bomb craters throughout the city, several of which are very deep, causing gas, electricity, and water pipes to be cut off. Among the bombed houses, there was one boys' middle school, one girls' middle school, two primary schools, and four rural schools. One of the schools had been converted into a hospital and was hit by 15 bombs. Two hospital staff died. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<h3>British and French Air Forces Bomb German Airfields and Attack German Supply Columns</h3>
<p>Paris: The Ministry of Aviation issued a communiqué stating, "A squadron of our heavy bombers flew to Germany last night and bombed various airfields, dropping no less than 30 tons of bombs. Our aircraft squadrons also flew repeatedly to the north of our country to attack German supply columns, inflicting heavy damage on them. In addition, our reconnaissance aircraft took photos on the front line and safely returned to their bases after completing their missions. As for the large German bomber squadrons, they were also active in our country this afternoon. Our fighter planes immediately took off to meet them, and anti-aircraft artillery also opened fire, resulting in the shooting down of several enemy aircraft, with as many as 17 planes in the Paris metropolitan area alone." (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<p>London: The Ministry of Aviation issued a communiqué last night stating that during a large-scale attack on northwestern Germany last night, bombers bombed troop assembly areas and set fuel tankers on fire. They also flew low to strafe transport columns with machine guns. When the aircraft bombed the important railway junction of Sost east of Dortmond, a row of high-explosive bombs landed in the center of the crowded train station. Trains in operation were hit and stopped, and freight cars loaded with goods were directly hit. Shortly after midnight, an attack on a troop assembly area was also quite successful, first destroying several fuel tankers, then setting them on fire with incendiary bombs. The road and rail junction at Osnabrück was attacked for the second night, and it was reported that one end of a canal bridge had been destroyed and the nearby railway tracks had been bombed. The enemy air force bases at Rotterdam, Deventer, and Wesel were all attacked at night. Several buildings on the Rotterdam airfield were hit by large quantities of large bombs. A large hangar at the Wesel airfield, which is currently used by German bomber squadrons, was seen with bombs landing on it and exploding. (Reuters, 4th)</p>

<h3>The Italian War Participation Issue: An Arrow Nocked and Ready to Be Released. The Cabinet Approved Four Important Administrative Matters. Rome is Filled with a Wartime Atmosphere. Wartime National Organization Law Applies to Philippine Territories</h3>
<p>Rome: The Cabinet held a State Council meeting today, chaired by Prime Minister Mussolini, which lasted for one and a half hours. Afterwards, a public statement was issued stating that the State Council had passed various measures, especially those concerning administrative issues. According to well-informed sources, the most important of these measures are: (1) Male civil servants in various civil administration agencies who have been drafted into the military will be replaced by women or elderly retired personnel; (2) Additional funds will be allocated to the Navy to build warships, the number of which has not been disclosed; (3) Increase the number of naval academy admissions; (4) The wartime national organization law will be extended to all African territories. (Havas dispatch on the 4th)</p>
<p>Rome: Today's meeting of the Italian Cabinet in Rome is seen by many as perhaps the most important meeting in history. However, the atmosphere in Rome today, at least on the surface, is very calm. There seemed to be extraordinary activity in the sky in the early morning, and the sound of artillery could be heard from afar. This is probably to make people aware of the scenes that may occur this week. The current hesitation will end sometime between Friday and next Tuesday. This is the unanimous opinion of the people, but there is no real basis for it. Rumor has it that the Fascist Grand Council has scheduled a meeting for tonight, and it is expected that the Supreme National Defense Committee will also hold a meeting. News from Paris claims that the next action of the Italian government will be to put forward a recent proposal to convene an international conference. Few believe this. The authorities allowed the newspapers in Rome to reprint this news, with the addition of a lukewarm response from London and Paris. (Reuters dispatch on the 4th)</p>
<p>Paris: After the Italian Cabinet held a meeting today, a public statement was issued stating that the measures passed were all administrative matters. Political figures here were not surprised to hear this, nor did they think that the Italian authorities were still hesitant. It is likely that Italy wants to delay for a few more days before taking final action. If Italy does make a final decision in the future, it will not be able to use the provocative attitude of France as an excuse. Since the outbreak of the current European war, all French newspapers have been cautious, and the French people and Italian expatriates in France have been able to live in peace. Even the French and Italian troops in the Alps have been able to show camaraderie. As for the economic demands made by Italy, France is also willing to negotiate with Italy. Although these negotiations have broken down, the blame should be borne by Italy. (Havas dispatch on the 4th)</p>
<p>New York: Columbia Broadcasting Company has just announced that it has received a broadcast message from Germany stating that Italian Crown Prince Umberto has left Rome and is heading to the headquarters of the army group. (Note: The Italian army is divided into two army groups, commanded by Crown Prince Umberto and Chief of General Staff General Graziani, respectively.) (Havas dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>Rome: Regarding the issue of Italy's participation in the war, political figures here generally believe that the country will inevitably participate in the war by the 8th of this month at the latest. Although all parties have tried their best to dissuade Italy from pulling back from the brink, it seems that Prime Minister Mussolini has decided to resort to war, with the attitude of letting the cannons speak. Even the Vatican has tried to maintain peace, but the Italian government has not yet responded to the most recent mediation. Generally, Italy firmly believes that although France's military strength is extremely strong, it will be difficult to resist the joint offensive of the German and Italian armies for a long time. It is expected that the war will be over before Britain continues to send expeditionary forces to France and the United States provides substantial assistance to Britain and France. In short, after the Italian Cabinet holds a cabinet meeting tomorrow morning, everything will be clear. (United Havas dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>Rumor Has It That German Troops Are Concentrating on the Austrian Border, Preparing to Help Italy Launch a Flanking Attack on France</p>
<p>New York: New York Special Report: A reporter in Belgrade reports that, according to unverified news, German troops are currently concentrated near Vienna. It is now believed that these troops are preparing to cross the Italian border to assist the Italian army in a flanking attack on France. It is also learned that German submarines piloted by Germans have now docked at the bases of the Dodecanese Islands, which shows that Italy apparently intends to accept German assistance. (Reuters dispatch on the 4th)</p>
<p>Rome: According to a report from the Rome correspondent of the Haitong News Agency, decisive events may occur this week. The reasons are as follows: (1) The news of the German army's continuous victories has left an extremely deep impression here; (2) Franco-Italian relations, according to news from Africa, have become increasingly tense, and Italians in Morocco and Algiers have been persecuted; (3) It is rumored in Tangier that Britain and France have plans to occupy the area; (4) Demonstrations demanding the return of Gibraltar have been held in Spain for days, showing the solidarity between Italy and Spain; (5) After German planes bombed Marseille yesterday, they flew south, making Italians feel that the war zone is getting closer and closer. Patriotic demonstrations have been held in Italy for days. 400,000 workers in Turin marched yesterday, showing their determination to obey the Duce's orders and decided to send a telegram to the Duce, which read: "Waiting for your command to advance and strive for victory." (Haitong dispatch on the 4th)</p>
<p>Rome: Italian figures are now increasingly convinced that Italy will soon participate in the war, and regard the postponement of the Rome World Exposition as another clear indication. Military doctors and veterinarians will be called up on Thursday. Italian newspapers are now filled with news against the Allied powers, such as a report from Italian East Africa stating that the Allied powers are planning to attack the area. Other news claims that Italian expatriates in French North Africa are being abused. Newspapers predict that the German army will use 8,000 aircraft to assist in a large-scale offensive along the French front lines of the Somme and Aisne rivers. "Il Popolo di Roma" stated, "Germany has divided the enemy forces and is now preparing to conquer them individually." (Reuters dispatch on the 4th)</p>
<h3>Britain and France Are Fully Prepared to Deal with Contingencies</h3>
<p>Italy's Request to Establish Bases in Spain Was Reportedly Rejected by Franco in Harsh Terms</p>
<p>Paris: According to the opinions of well-informed French figures, although the possibility of Italy joining the German side in the war cannot be ignored, it may not take decisive steps immediately. There are various reasons to believe that Germany intends to launch a new offensive against France. From the German point of view, it is naturally hoped that the majority of French manpower reserves can be contained in other areas. If Italy participates in the war, France will undoubtedly dispatch troops to the southeast. However, before sending troops, France must first determine whether Italy is one of us. (Reuters dispatch on the 4th)</p>
<p>Paris: Amid French preparations to deal with any emergency situation and any Italian attack, French political observers today stated that whether Italy immediately starts a war against the Allied powers or first launches a "peace offensive," the French see little difference. Observers also stated that Italy's open intervention is already generally expected. However, if the peace plan proposed by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini is based on territorial changes, as Germany has done, or is based on demands on the Mediterranean, then the Allied powers will only have a negative response to such a plan. France is fully prepared to deal with any Italian action, whether it is launched on the Alpine border, in Corsica, in Africa, or in Syria. Even if Italy has decided on its actions, the basis of cooperation between Germany and Italy remains unclear. Whether Italy's operations are independent or attached to Germany's coattails is a question that is worth discussing. French journalist Mr. Taybo said, "Important Nazi figures believe that if Mussolini participates in the war, he may not strictly follow Hitler's words. Mussolini may violate Hitler's wishes and hope to gain something in the Balkans, which will inevitably cause the consequences that Hitler fears." In addition, "Le Paris-Soir" believes that one of the purposes of the German planes bombing southeastern France is to create a Franco-Italian dispute and force Italy to take action. According to the newspaper, the German planes initially flew downstream along the Rhone River to the sea, and then turned north to make the French suspect that the planes came from the Mediterranean. The newspaper said, "If the German side wants to confuse right and wrong and create a Franco-Italian dispute in the two days before Mussolini's speech, is it not the case that the German planes did this? Italy's dangerous intervention is generally expected, because the situation in the Balkans has already become serious." (United Press dispatch on the 4th)</p>
<p>London: The Allied powers are now fully prepared for the possibility of Italy joining the war to help Germany. They will no longer make diplomatic efforts to ease Mussolini's decision. Political circles here mostly expect Italy to launch between June 5th and 10th. The Allied powers have completed their defenses on both the east and west sides of the Mediterranean and on land along the borders of Italy and Libya. Regarding Italy's position, two developments are enough to clarify it: first, Italian Foreign Minister Ciano has notified the Allied powers of Italy's decision and said that our country is about to participate in the war; second, diplomats from neutral countries have received a report from Madrid stating that the Italian Prime Minister's request to use Spanish territory for Italian military operations has been rejected. According to this report, the Italian Duce began making this request to Franco three months ago. Recently, he made the request again, wanting to use Algeciras, the Balearic Islands, La Línea, and Spanish Morocco as operational bases. It is heard that Franco was still hesitant when the Italian Prime Minister made the first request, but the second time he simply rejected it. If Italy obtains La Línea and Algeciras as bases, it can use them to threaten Gibraltar. If Spanish Morocco is used by Italy for military purposes, it will be difficult for the Allied forces to prevent Italy from controlling the gateway to the western Mediterranean. If the Balearic Islands are occupied by Italy, the French army will not be able to transport its colonial troops to the European continent to fight. British newspapers reported that the Axis powers are pressuring General Franco, saying that if he does not cooperate with Germany and Italy, they will overthrow his regime with the Falange party.

<h3>Nice Listed as a Territorial Claim</h3>
<p>Rome: The "Nice and Savoy Action Committee" has recently been established here, with former diplomat Gonsaudin as chairman. According to the committee, Nice and Savoy were ceded to France when Italy was unified in 1860 and are part of Italy's territorial claims against France. (Havas dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<h3>World Expo Postponed</h3>
<p>Rome: The Italian government's announcement of the postponement of its 1942 World Exposition was considered here yesterday to be the most serious indication that Italy will participate in the war in the past two weeks. Well-informed sources pointed out that Prime Minister Mussolini has repeatedly indicated that the preparations for the Expo are proof of Italy's intention for peace. Recently, most of the 53 members of the British Remote Prohibited Goods Control Committee stationed in Rome left here by train to France yesterday. It is heard that other members will leave the country on Tuesday. (United Press dispatch on the 4th)</p>
<h3>Italian Expatriates in the Egyptian Capital Are Withdrawing One After Another</h3>
<p>Egyptian Capital: Due to the tense situation in the Mediterranean, the number of Italian expatriates returning to their country by taking domestic ships is increasing daily. Today, many Italian elementary school students boarded ships at Port Said to return to their country. Those residing in Egypt are extremely anxious about the news that Italy is about to participate in the war. (Havas dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<h3>Rumor Has It That Adriatic Sea Strengthens Its Power; German Consulate in Split, Yugoslavia, Expands</h3>
<p>Paris: The German consulate in Split, Yugoslavia, has recently been expanded and handed over to the counselor of the German embassy in Belgrade for management, replacing the original administrator, a Yugoslavian. This move is clearly intended to strengthen Germany's power in the Adriatic Sea. According to reports, Split, also known as Spalato, is a seaport in Dalmatia, located on a peninsula extending into the Adriatic Sea. (Reuters dispatch on the 4th)</p>
<h3>Churchill Reports on the War Situation in the House of Commons; The German Northern Route Is Coming Fiercely; The British and French Allied Forces Are Fighting Hard</h3>
<p>London: Prime Minister Churchill stated in the House of Commons today about the progress of the war, saying that after the French defense line on the Sedan and Meuse rivers was breached in the second week of May, the British and French forces that had entered Belgium at the request of the King of Belgium could only retreat quickly to Amiens and the south to protect themselves. However, this fact was not realized. The French commander-in-chief initially thought that the French army was capable of making up for the gap, and the northern army was under his command, and that retreating at that time would cause more than twenty divisions of the Belgian army to be destroyed by the enemy and abandon the entire land of Belgium. This point could be predicted. Therefore, when the strength and scope of the German invasion were discovered, and when General Weygand replaced General Gamelin as the French commander-in-chief, the British and French forces in Belgium worked hard to defend the right side of the Belgian army and gave their own elite troops to the newly formed French army, which had to advance to the Somme River with strong strength and defend it. However, the German army soon poured into the right wing and rear of the northern army, using as many as eight or nine armored divisions, each division with about 400 armored vehicles of various types. The army cut off all communication between our army and the main French army, and thus our army's food and ammunition supply route was cut off, because all supplies had to pass through Amiens first, and then through Abbeville. The German army quickly reached the coastal cities of Boulogne and Calais, and almost reached Dunkirk. After the counterattack of these armored and mechanized troops, a large number of German divisions took trucks, and behind the trucks were the dense German regular army, advancing on foot, which was relatively slow. The German people have always been prepared to be led to trample on the lands of other countries. As for freedom and comfort, they have never experienced them.</p>
<p>The attack of this armored division almost reached Dunkirk. Although it was not certain, it was almost certain. Boulogne and Calais soon became places of fierce fighting. After a short period of resistance, the garrison in Boulogne retreated under the orders of the British government. A brigade of riflemen, the 60th Rifle Regiment, the Queen Victoria's Rifles, and a large British tank corps, along with thousands of French soldiers, totaling about 4,000, defended Calais to the end. (Applause) The German army demanded that the British brigadier surrender within an hour, but the officer refused. (Applause) After four days of fierce street fighting, Calais fell silent. This memorable defensive battle came to an end. The navy only rescued thirty survivors who were not injured, and we do not know the fate of their comrades. However, their sacrifice was not in vain. At least two armored divisions had been transferred to overcome them, otherwise the two divisions would have attacked the British Expeditionary Force. Their containment of the German army has added a glorious page to the history of light armored divisions. Because at this time, the waterway to Gravelines was still open and defended by the French army, which allowed the port of Dunkirk to remain passable. When the northern army realized that it could not reorganize its communication with the French army through Amiens, there was only one way to choose. At this time, it seemed to be in despair. The British, French, and Belgian forces were almost surrounded, and their only retreat route was to retreat to a port and the nearby beaches. They were then subjected to fierce attacks from all sides, and the enemy outnumbered them many times.</p>
<p>When I asked the House of Commons a week ago to set this afternoon to state the war situation, I was deeply afraid that it would be difficult to announce the greatest military catastrophe in our long history at that time. Several experts and I saw the same thing. At that time, I thought that only about twenty or thirty thousand people could get on board. The entire French First Army and the entire British Expeditionary Force stationed north of the gap between Amiens and Abbeville seemed destined to be defeated by the enemy in the plains, or to surrender due to lack of food and ammunition. This serious news is what I will ask the House of Commons and the nation to prepare to listen to. The British army, which is the root, core, and brain of the British army on which we have relied in the past and will rely on in the future to build a war army, seems to be completely annihilated on the battlefield, or will fall into humiliating or hungry surrender. This was the atmosphere a week ago. But another blow could prove to be fatal, and Father suddenly descended on us. The King of Belgium had previously called on us to provide assistance. If this monarch and his government had not broken off with the Allied powers that had saved Belgium from destruction in the last war, if they had intended to hide in deadly neutrality, then the French and British armies could not only save Belgium, but perhaps even save Poland.

<h3>The Situation in the Mediterranean Is Becoming Tense; Egypt Is Intensifying Its Alert; Britain and France Have Strong Military Power in the Near East; If Italy Challenges, It Will Encounter Misfortune</h3>
<p>Cairo: Although newspapers around the world believe that Italy will soon join the war, Egyptian figures do not think so. The creation of this psychology is largely due to the strong naval and land forces stationed by the Allied powers in the Near East. Many people believe that if Italy dares to challenge these well-equipped and strategically stationed troops, it will be tantamount to madness, because the initial action of the Allied troops will be to blockade the Suez Canal and cut off the connection between Abyssinia and Italy. However, the Egyptian government is now engaged in preparedness to defend the country. (Reuters dispatch on the 4th)</p>

<h3>European War Background: Memoirs of Ambassador Henderson (Part 5) Translated by Section</h3>
<p>At 1:30 PM on September 29, 1938, the leaders of Britain, France, Germany, and Italy convened at the Nazi Party's new building in Munich. Mussolini arrived by train from Rome, Daladier by plane from Paris, and Chamberlain followed closely behind. The German people cheered along the streets. The four leaders discussed for thirteen hours, concluding at 2:30 AM on Friday. All parties were able to calmly deliberate at length. With Mussolini present, Hitler was less inclined to lose his temper. Mussolini's mediation between the two sides made compromise easier. Ribbentrop's scheme failed. The meeting's delayed conclusion was largely due to the need to translate each person's speech into English, French, and German, and the difficulty in hastily drafting the agreement. Among the leaders, only Mussolini could speak all three languages. Finally, after considering Hitler's memorandum presented at Godesberg and the successive amendments proposed by Britain and France, the final agreement was drafted, which is the world-renowned Munich Agreement.</p>
<p>The Munich Agreement deprived Hitler of three things he desired: giving the German army combat experience, personally becoming a hero conquering other countries, and venting his anger on Czech President Beneš and the Czech people. Chamberlain, by eliminating a world war opposed by the German military and civilians, might, in a sense, be something for which Hitler should be grateful. However, on the other hand, Hitler being forced to change his military plans meant that any sense of gratitude would be overwhelmed by his resentment. Furthermore, some of Hitler's subordinates constantly urged him to fight Britain while it was underprepared, but now he had accepted the Munich Agreement, missing a golden opportunity. Afterward, Hitler was deeply disturbed, fearing that these pro-war voices were correct, and he became increasingly irritable.</p>
<p>Even based on the Munich Conference experience, Hitler was negotiating with three individuals of equal status, none of whom were subservient. Having had this experience, Hitler thereafter disliked resolving issues through negotiation. Moreover, the widespread popularity of Mr. Chamberlain in Germany somewhat diminished Hitler's prestige, which displeased him.</p>
<p>Hitler was Austrian, possessing the opportunistic traits characteristic of Austrians. Complex schemes with uncertain outcomes were typical of him. Unfortunately, Hitler's opportune timing allowed him to become increasingly arrogant and domineering. His risky maneuvers involved his close associates preparing in secret, while Hitler himself waited for the other side to make a mistake, then seizing the opportunity. In March 1938, Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg held a plebiscite, and in March of the following year, the Czech government rashly interfered in Slovakia. Hitler, without revealing his intentions, seized the opportunity to advance, all of which are examples of this. After the Munich Agreement was signed, Germany was truly at a crossroads between adventurous advancement and maintaining the status quo. Generally speaking, if Germany had followed the path of maintaining the status quo, the people would have lived in peace and prosperity, and Hitler himself, having achieved great accomplishments over the past six years, should have rested and proceeded with his plan to restore Germany. Hitler's so-called desire for long-term peace should have been sincere. When I returned to Berlin in mid-February 1939, Hitler, even if he hadn't considered the path of maintaining the status quo, had not yet decided when to take another risk. A few days later, when I met him, he seemed genuinely pleased to see me. Göring was about to leave for a vacation on the Italian coast. Ribbentrop assured me that my long absence from duty was due to illness and had nothing to do with the recall of the American ambassador in November after the mistreatment of Jews. His attitude towards me was also good. This impression led me to be optimistic, but I quickly realized my mistake.</p>
<p>On March 1, Hitler hosted the annual banquet for the diplomatic corps, and I first sensed that the overall situation was more ominous than promising. Typically, Hitler would stand in the reception room after the banquet and speak with the envoys of various countries for five to ten minutes each. The previous month, when I met him, he shook my hand three times and seemed quite friendly, but this time it was different. When speaking to me, his attitude was evasive, his eyes did not meet mine directly, and his words were mostly empty, strongly asserting that Britain should not obstruct Germany in Central Europe. I had heard this before, so there was nothing new or surprising, but his attitude gave me a sense of bewilderment and unease. Looking back, he must have weighed the pros and cons of using force against Czechoslovakia and decided to launch an attack on March 15. I remembered the situation when I met him on March 3 of the previous year. At that time, he was constantly thinking about Vienna, and the German army finally marched into Austria on March 11. That year, he decided to occupy Czechoslovakia on March 11. At that time, a large army was gathered in Vienna, waiting for Hitler to inspect them and celebrate the first anniversary of the annexation of Austria to Germany, and troops were also deployed in southern Germany to strengthen Italy's demands on France.</p>
<p>Once Hitler made a decision, he would ensure that it proceeded in a rational manner. On March 11, he summoned Slovak Catholic priest Jozef Tiso to Berlin, urging him to declare independence and assume the presidency, placing the small state of Slovakia under German protection. Czech President Hácha, hoping to spare his country from invasion and terror and at least obtain humane treatment, also followed Tiso and arrived in Berlin on March 14, entirely on his own initiative.</p>
<p>Little did he know that Hitler had no humanity to speak of. Hácha was old and frail, and his daughter accompanied him to take care of him. The Germans welcomed him with courtesy. Ribbentrop presented his daughter with a bouquet of flowers upon arrival at the station, and Hitler gave her a box of chocolates when they arrived at the hotel. This was what he called humanity. Czech Foreign Minister Chvalkovský accompanied the president. After Hácha and Ribbentrop exchanged greetings, Hitler received Hácha at the Chancellery at one o'clock in the morning. A German doctor was on standby at the Chancellery to treat Hácha if he became unwell during the talks. However, before Hácha arrived at the Chancellery, the German army had already entered Czechoslovakia.</p>
<p>Hitler and Hácha continued until four o'clock in the morning. Hácha told Hitler that he was deeply concerned that Czech troops would resist the invaders. Hitler immediately warned him that if that were the case, the German air force would immediately bomb Prague. Göring, who had returned, also said the same. After repeated struggles, Hácha personally called his cabinet members to convey this message. Besides that, Hácha could only sign the prepared treasonous treaty.</p>
<p>Hácha was old and frail, but I would have been able to maintain my dignity as head of state and refuse to sign. On the morning of March 15, Hitler arrived in Prague before Hácha and announced to the public that Bohemia and Moravia were now German protectorates.</p>
<p>The Polish question soon became tense, and I tried unsuccessfully to meet with Hitler on July 29. At that time, Hitler was inspecting the Siegfried Line with Ribbentrop, an ominous sign. Soon, the clouds of war thickened, the French army was mobilized, and the British navy was also taking swift action. This was intended to show Hitler that they were prepared to fight. But Ribbentrop remained calm, always believing that Britain would never fight.</p>
<p>Hitler was also self-aggrandizing at the time, actually considering Ribbentrop to be the second Bismarck. And Ribbentrop also considered himself such, advocating for war to prove his position. Bismarck would not hesitate to falsify the Ems Dispatch to provoke the Franco-Prussian War. Ribbentrop might as well imitate him, obscuring Britain's true intentions to achieve his ambitions. His refusal to give me the conditions for resolving the Danzig and Polish Corridor issues—wasn't that Bismarck's old trick? Göring once told me, "What you dislike about Ribbentrop is his obstinacy." I replied, "His obstinacy sometimes borders on idiocy."</p>
<p>When Hitler began negotiations with Stalin is a question mark. In Hitler's speech on April 28, the anti-Soviet rhetoric of the past was noticeably absent. On May 3, Maxim Litvinov, a supporter of the League of Nations, was also removed from his position as Foreign Minister. Several weeks later, the new Soviet ambassador to Germany was received by Hitler with great courtesy. All of these were clues. The Soviet Union's agreement with Germany was nothing more than a desire to see it and Britain and France destroy each other, so that it could profit from the chaos.</p>
<p>Until August, Hitler and his subordinates also criticized Britain and France's negotiations with the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>On August 23, I went to Berchtesgaden to meet with Hitler. At that time, Ribbentrop had arrived in Moscow to sign the German-Soviet Pact. Hitler was triumphant, not hesitating to talk about how valuable this pact was. I then questioned him about his past anti-Soviet stance. He was momentarily stunned and speechless, then said that Britain and France had driven him into the arms of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>With the German-Soviet Pact completed, the situation in Poland became acute. On August 31, the Germans announced their final demands on Poland. The next morning, I learned the details from Göring's aides and immediately conveyed them to Polish Ambassador Lipski, reporting them to his government. This was the last time the Polish ambassador was able to speak to his authorities by phone. By the evening, he was banned from doing so. At noon that day, I informed the German Foreign Office that the Polish government had accepted the British government's advice and was instructing Ambassador Lipski to contact the German government to immediately implement a temporary solution to the Danzig issue. The Germans never responded. The Polish government then instructed Ambassador Lipski to meet with Ribbentrop. The situation was thus extended by twelve hours. But what Hitler wanted to know was whether Lipski was a plenipotentiary representative. Otherwise, the arrow was already on the string, and Poland would either have to submit or be severely beaten.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Directives to Universities: Graduation Exams Changed to Comprehensive System; Main Subjects from Previous Years Included Before Overall Change; Lingnan University Decided to Hold Exams in Mid-June</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong Dispatch) In order to improve and assess the academic performance of universities and vocational schools, the Ministry of Education has formulated six measures, the most important of which is to stipulate that, starting this semester, graduation exams will be changed to a comprehensive system. In addition to testing subjects from the last semester, it will also test major specialized subjects from previous years. Those who fail will not be allowed to graduate. It is reported that Lingnan University, Guangzhou University, and National University in Hong Kong have all received this directive and have decided to implement the comprehensive system starting with this year's graduation exams, and have decided to hold the exams on June 14th and 15th. The Ministry of Education's Measures for Assessing Academic Performance and Comprehensive Examinations for Vocational Schools and Above are copied below:</p>
<p>It has been observed that the level of students in vocational schools and above has slightly improved compared to the past, but the qualitative development of vocational schools and above has not been able to fully match the quantitative development. In order to improve the level of students in vocational schools and above and seek to improve the quality of higher education, the key points of the Measures for Assessing the Academic Performance of Students in Vocational Schools and Above are hereby formulated as follows: (1) Periodic tests must be held at least once per semester. The test papers should be properly kept by the school, and the Ministry may order their review at any time during the year, or review them according to the curriculum when sending personnel to inspect. (2) Students' usual lecture notes, reading notes, as well as reading practice and experiment reports, should be combined and assessed separately from temporary experiments to form the usual grades. The method of review is the same as in the previous article. (3) Semester exams should be strictly implemented at the end of each semester and should not be held early. Semester exam grades should also be combined with usual grades to form semester grades. The semester exam grades mentioned above must be registered and submitted to the Ministry for review at the end of the semester in accordance with academic regulations. The Ministry may also randomly review test papers of certain subjects. (4) Students who fail a semester exam but score between 40 and 60 points may be given a make-up exam or required to repeat the course. If the number of failed credits exceeds one-third of the total number of credits taken in the semester, the student should be required to repeat the grade. If it exceeds one-half, the student should be required to withdraw from the school. (5) Graduation exams will be changed to a comprehensive system. In addition to testing at least four subjects in the final semester (at least five for vocational schools and specialized schools), at least two of which must be from the entire academic year (at least three for vocational schools and specialized schools), at least three major specialized subjects from previous years must also be tested. Those who fail will not be allowed to graduate. The graduation exam subjects mentioned above must be reported to the Ministry for approval when submitting the list of graduates. (6) The Graduation Examination Committee and students' graduation theses (graduation theses are required for vocational schools and specialized courses) must be strictly implemented in accordance with the university regulations and the revised regulations for vocational schools. Starting this semester, all schools should strictly implement the above-mentioned regulations. In addition to separate orders, this order is hereby issued for compliance and reporting. [Signed] Minister Chen Lifu.</p>
<h3>Provincial and Municipal Training of National Education Teachers (1): Outline of Measures Promulgated by the Ministry</h3>
<p>(Chongqing Airmail) Since the promulgation of the Outline of Organizations at All Levels of Counties, the implementation of national education throughout the country needs to be promoted urgently and without delay. It is learned that the Ministry of Education, in order to lay the foundation for the implementation of this education, has promulgated the Outline of Measures for Training National Education Teachers in Various Provinces and Municipalities in accordance with the provisions of the Outline for the Implementation of National Education, and ordered the education departments and bureaus of various provinces and municipalities to strictly comply. The main points are disclosed below:</p>
<p>(1) Principals and teachers of central schools and principals of national schools should, in principle, be trained by normal schools and special normal courses. Teachers of national schools should, in principle, be trained by simplified normal schools and simplified normal courses.</p>
<p>(2) When provinces and cities begin to prepare for the establishment of central schools and national schools, they should open training classes for principals of central schools and national schools, gather personnel preparing to serve as principals of central schools and national schools, and provide them with one to three months of training. The training subjects will be determined separately. The above-mentioned training may be jointly held by the provincial and municipal educational administrative organs and the local administrative cadre training committees.</p>
<p>(3) Provinces and cities should conduct a general registration and assessment of primary school teachers in accordance with the ministry's regulations for provinces and cities. For teachers who fail the assessment but whose academic ability is still competent, national education teacher refresher courses may be organized and given three to six months of training to serve as substitute teachers. The subjects will be determined separately.</p>
<p>(4) If there is a special shortage of national education teachers in a province or city, a short-term national education teacher training class may be organized with the approval of the Ministry of Education to train substitute teachers for national schools.</p>
<p>(5) In order to meet the needs of the number of teachers, normal schools and simplified normal schools may adopt a "training-internship period system." The methods are as follows:</p>
<p>1. Normal school: Two years of training at school - two or one years of internship - one year of training back at school. 2. Simplified normal school: Three years of training at school - two or one years of internship - one year of training back at school.</p>
<p>(6) Schools implementing the "training-internship period system" must continue to provide students with regular correspondence guidance during the internship period, and must set up traveling internship instructors. The curriculum distribution for the "training-internship period system" will be determined separately.</p>
<p>(7) If there is an extraordinary shortage of national education teachers in each county within the normal school district, and there is no formal teacher training institution in the area to train teachers, the provincial educational administrative organ may temporarily designate a public junior high school or the county government may submit a request for approval to add teacher training subjects to the third grade of the county junior high school in accordance with the Ministry's Measures for Adding Teacher Training Subjects to the Third Grade of Junior High Schools to train substitute teachers for national schools.</p>
<p>(8) In order to train a large number of national education teachers in provinces and cities, during the first phase of national education implementation, special normal courses and simplified normal courses attached to normal schools and secondary schools may be utilized as much as possible, and refresher courses and short-term training classes may be organized to train substitute teachers. However, at the beginning of the second phase, the number of classes in various types of normal schools should be gradually increased, and the number of various short-term training classes should be reduced.</p>
<p>(9) In order to facilitate the advanced studies of in-service teachers or volunteer teachers, provinces and cities should organize correspondence schools or summer seminars to assist their advanced studies and examine their performance.</p>
<p>(10) Provinces and cities should set up traveling instructors for correspondence schools for primary school teachers to hold short-term seminars for correspondence school students in different subjects and regions.</p>
<p>(11) Provincial and municipal educational administrative organs should formulate measures to guide graduates of central schools (or senior primary schools) to enter simplified normal schools, and to guide graduates of junior high schools to enter normal schools, and supervise and order schools to earnestly implement them, in order to guide students to the rational aspirations of entering normal schools.</p>
<p>(12) Provincial and municipal educational administrative organs should formulate guidance measures for the admission of new students to normal schools, and supervise and order all types of normal schools (departments) to earnestly implement them, in order to establish the understanding and aspirations of normal school students to engage in education and grassroots political work.</p>
<p>(13) Provinces and cities should designate appropriate villages (towns, pao) as the sites for students of all types of normal schools (departments) to intern in village (town) and pao administration.</p>
<p>(14) When provinces and cities implement the newly promulgated teaching subject and hour tables for various types of normal schools (departments), training classes, and refresher courses, before the curriculum standards are revised and promulgated by the Ministry of Education, they should report the implementation situation and the content of the textbooks they have revised, supplemented, or compiled to the Ministry for filing at any time.</p>
<p>(15) Substitute teachers and teachers who have completed refresher courses in provinces and cities should be examined annually in accordance with the regulations for the examination of primary school teachers, so as to obtain qualifications in accordance with the examination.</p>
<p>(16) Provincial and municipal educational administrative organs should formulate a four-year plan for training national education teachers in accordance with the various existing provisions of this outline of measures, referring to the normal education facility plans and the national education implementation plans of the respective provinces and cities, and the number of teachers needed annually, and submit it to the Ministry of Education for approval and implementation.</p>
<p>(17) When provinces and cities plan to train teachers needed for popularizing national education, they should still set up normal schools in each district according to the original normal education implementation plan of each province and city. If each district cannot set up a separate women's normal school, a women's normal department should be set up in the normal school.</p>

Only eight people are participating in this event, with six scheduled to qualify, so only two will be eliminated.</p>
<p>Looking at the situation, Sun Hupei of the Chinese team has the strength to finish within one minute, and not only is there strong hope for him, but he should also have a good result. Guan Youwen should also be able to get a place. On the Western side, MacLaine, Jacobs, and Lumbo have strong momentum. H. Turner of the School League and Talbolin of the Western Youth also have hope of qualifying in the preliminaries. According to the record for the event, the highest record is held by Finke at exactly 59 seconds. In international track and field, which is measured in meters, Tao Yingjie holds the record at exactly 60 seconds. The national record, also measured in meters, is Jin Guan's 58.3 seconds, which is the best result.</p>
<p>Special Treatment for Students: Tickets for this meet were originally priced at one yuan and one jiao in national currency. Now, in order to give students a discount for attending, student discount tickets will be sold for only five jiao in national currency for the exciting final events on Saturday. Anyone wearing a formal school badge and having sufficient proof of being a student will be able to enjoy this discount.</p>

<h3>Grass-Roots Group B Tournament Opens</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, No Chinese Participate: The 1940 Shanghai tennis season has unfolded with the rising heat. The most important events to punctuate this season are the Group A and B leagues.

<h3>Finance: Foreign Exchange Gradually Stabilizes After Tightness</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market conditions: HSBC's listed rates were announced at 9:30 AM. The British exchange rate was reduced by 25, to 3 pence and a halfpenny. The US exchange rate continued to decrease by 375, to $4.625. The German exchange rate remained unavailable. The Dutch exchange rate reappeared, at 8 florins and 625 cents, an increase of 75 cents compared to the listed price on the 11th of last month. Exchange rates for Hong Kong, Japan, etc., also uniformly decreased. The unofficial British and US exchange markets initially experienced extreme tightness, then suddenly rebounded slightly. The spot market continued to tighten sharply. According to a source in the exchange market, the New York market recently saw a sharp decline in US stocks and commodities. Chinese speculators in this city suffered significant losses, estimated at around US$5 million. Most had to cover their positions in the black market, resulting in a severe shortage of funds. Hong Kong speculators have also been telegraphing in repeatedly recently. Therefore, during the buying frenzy yesterday, the spot pound initially rose sharply to 3 pence and 625 cents, and the US dollar fell to its lowest point at $4.90625. Fortunately, HSBC, American Bank, and the British firm Sassoon sold, and Hong Kong funds and local Chinese firms re-entered the market.

<h3>Profit-Taking Not Uncommon, Gold Market's Rise Hindered</h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot gold market fluctuated around 6,400 yuan. Although the foreign exchange market was tightening and buying interest was strong, the rise was hindered by retail investors holding onto profits and selling at high prices. The morning opening was at 6,480 yuan, a sharp increase of 150 yuan compared to the previous day, reportedly due to eager buying by a certain gold firm. Subsequently, continuous selling by retail investors and money changers, as well as a rebound in the foreign exchange market, caused the price to gradually decrease to 6,320 yuan. However, as the foreign exchange market remained tight, securities firms and gold firms bought in, and the afternoon closing was at 6,400 yuan. Initially, the afternoon situation was still heated. Securities firms and gold firms bought again, driving the price from 6,420 yuan to as high as 450 yuan. Before closing, retail investors, money changers, and banks uniformly sold aggressively, resulting in a closing price of 6,370 yuan, a further increase of 40 yuan compared to the previous day. The market momentum weakened after closing. The final price was 6,340 yuan, with no buyers. The total trading volume for the day was approximately several thousand taels. Sales of gold jewelry in silver shops were flat. Customs gold, etc., remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Spot Gold Still Up 40 Yuan</p>
<p>From the morning, each bar (ten taels) initially reported tightening foreign exchange rates, strengthening confidence. A certain gold firm first absorbed 20 taels from a securities firm at 6,480 yuan, up 150 yuan from the previous day. Subsequently, retail investors were willing to sell, frequently selling off. At that time, silver shops and money changers were also selling off. Soon, the foreign exchange market suddenly rebounded, and the appetite of the banks weakened, and the price soon fell by 130 yuan. A silver shop sold 10 taels to a money changer for 6,350 yuan. As sellers gradually decreased, banks and securities firms bought in, and the price rose again, exceeding the 6,400 yuan mark. A money changer bought 20 taels from a bank for 6,420 yuan. As the foreign exchange market reported loosening again, money changers, retail investors, etc., sold off again, and gold firms also sold, causing a decline of 100 yuan. A gold firm sold 20 taels to a bank for 6,320 yuan. At noon, the foreign exchange market strengthened again, buying interest revived, and securities firms and gold firms bought again, raising the price by another 100 yuan. A money changer bought 20 taels from a bank for 6,420 yuan. Near closing, the price slightly declined. A bank sold 20 taels to a gold firm for 6,400 yuan as the noon closing price. The afternoon opening situation was quite good. A bank bought 50 taels from a gold firm, etc., for 6,420 yuan. Thereafter, there were still many sellers. Banks mutually dealt 30 taels, slightly lower at 6,410 yuan. Subsequently, as a certain gold firm and securities firms bought aggressively, the price rose by another 40 yuan. A gold firm bought 30 taels from a bank for 6,450 yuan. Later, as buyers decreased, profit-taking investors sold, and the market momentum suddenly turned downward, immediately retreating to the 6,400 yuan mark. Subsequently, money changers and banks continued to sell off, falling back by several tens of yuan. A gold firm sold 10 taels to a money changer for 6,360 yuan. Afterwards, a securities firm bought 30 taels from a bank for 6,370 yuan as the closing price. The result was an increase of 40 yuan compared to the previous day. After closing, banks bought aggressively, while money changers and retail investors had a strong selling appetite. Trading was brisk at 6,360-70 yuan. Afterwards, as buyers stopped buying, the final price was 6,340 yuan, with no buyers. The entire day saw fluctuations of 160 yuan. The selling price of the current gold firm's brand gold was slightly higher than the spot price. The buying price was reduced by several tens of yuan. The current standard gold price was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price, with few transactions.</p>
<p>Gold Jewelry Rises and Falls Back</p>
<p>The initial selling price of gold jewelry per tael was still 650 yuan at Da Tong Heng. At 9:30 AM, the price increased by 10 yuan. At 11:00 AM, the price fell back by 10 yuan. After that, there were no changes. The result was flat, with Da Tong Heng still offering 650 yuan. The new firms had the same prices as above.

<h3>Silver Bar Sharply Increases by One Penny</h3>

<h3>Securities: Domestic Debt Sees a Boost in Confidence</h3>
<p>Foreign Stocks Are Extremely Dull; China-Belgium-US Bonds Drawn</p>
<p>The securities market saw a general increase in prices yesterday. After Zao Yang was recaptured, confidence was boosted, and short sellers were somewhat panicked. Currently, both long and short positions are unable to take action due to their indecisiveness, so buying and selling are also flickering and uncertain. After a period of high prices, it is easy to suffer setbacks. It has not yet reached the stage of a true price increase. Trading was relatively active yesterday. Type A broke through 60 yuan, and Type E also broke through 50 yuan. Tong Ji, Lian Yi, and Yu Chang received more Type A and Type E. Hong Kang, Run Li, and Tong Kang saw selling. The noon closing price rose by 35 to 60 cents. The opening was particularly strong in the afternoon. Lian Yi, Sheng Da, Geng Xing, and Yi Chang all saw demand. However, sellers of Type E from No. 16 were scarce, and the market weakened. Run Li, Jiu Feng, and Hu He Ji saw selling. The market momentum suddenly weakened by 23 cents. However, the results were still good, ranging from 15 cents to 55 cents. The total number of transactions was more than 500,000 yuan. A simplified table is shown below:</p>
<p>Category | Highest | Lowest | Closing | Previous Closing Day</p>
<p>------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | --------</p>
<p>Unified A | 60.75 | 59.95 | 60.50 | Up 0.55</p>

<p>Stock trading: 50 shares of the Shanghai Yarn Exchange were traded, advocating for cash at 40.</p>

Selling pressure increased. Almost all stocks closed at their lowest prices. Although the decline cannot be said to be drastic.</p>

<h3>Cotton Yarn: Yarn Firms Being Liquidated, Speculators Fearful, Market Trading Is No Longer the Same</h3>
<p>The yarn market is calm, not escaping its state of stagnation. This is because raw materials are scarce and factory profits are thin. Furthermore, the general speculators' thoughts are not as strong as they used to be, so market transactions have decreased. In addition, the advertisements for the liquidation of yarn firms are numerous, so people are increasingly fearful. Although some are still buying and selling, most are aware of this situation, and many have let go and are watching, waiting for the opportunity to decide the outcome.</p>
<p>The current yarn market opened in the morning. 20-count Double Horse continued the heat from the afternoon of the previous day, rising to 1,400 yuan, then slightly falling to 1,385 yuan. Then, it was heard that the exchange rate was still decreasing, and the buying wind suddenly ignited, rising to 1,425 yuan. Unexpectedly, the high price caused profit-takers to emerge, the market loosened, and the market immediately fell to 1,360 yuan. The closing slightly improved. It was found that the transaction volume for half a day was 1,590 bales. The price of 20-count Double Horse rose by 20 yuan. 650 pieces of yarn were shipped to Hong Kong today. The amount of yarn bought by each group is listed separately below:</p>
<p>Hong Kong: 700, Counterparts: 890</p>
<p>Total: 1,590</p>
<h3>Factory Yarn Shipments More Difficult, Cotton Market Declining</h3>
<p>The cotton market trading is exceptionally sluggish. Factories still have no demand. This is because the yarn sold at high prices by the factories has been affected by the market, and shipments are difficult. Therefore, the raw cotton business remains stagnant. The current cotton trading is listed below:</p>
<p>Kang Jiang Hua: 205.00, Counterparts bought 100 pieces</p>
<p>Omura: 204.00, Counterparts bought 100 pieces</p>
<p>Da Zhong Ji: 245.00, Counterparts bought 150 bales</p>
<p>In other news, the foreign cotton market price: The New York cotton market was quiet. Due to the lack of important buyers and spot merchants, overseas cotton merchants sold off in the market. As a result, the closing price fell by 5, 6, 8, and 9 pounds. The Indian cotton market: Yesterday, the forecast fell by 8 rupees.</p>
<p>The Shanghai foreign cotton trading has been exceptionally quiet in recent days. Although the exchange rate has tightened, raw cotton trading has not been active. Only the thoughts of counterparts have become more firm. However, the selling price of foreign firms, according to the exchange rate settlement, their selling price is larger than that of ordinary counterparts. The yesterday's cotton market, converted to a futures price for delivery to the factory at a US exchange rate of $5.0625, is as follows:</p>
<p>20 count: US Metrin: 23.90, Lower Grade: 32.0</p>
<p>32 count: US Metrin: 344.10, Lower Grade: 323.20</p>
<p>42 count: US Metrin: 347.90, Lower Grade: 337.0</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth Has a Solid Foundation</h3>
<p>The cloth market initially rose and then fell back. The recent turnaround in cloth prices has led local customer groups to seize the opportunity, and the number of transactions has been quite considerable. However, the inventory in the market is particularly large, and there is still a surplus of supply over demand, so sellers are unable to raise prices. However, compared to the previous week, the market has tightened slightly. White goods, coarse and fine cloth, and twill have increased by 10 to 25 cents. Colored cloth has increased by 25 to 50 cents. Summer light-colored goods have a short sales period, and sellers mostly offer lower prices. Local dye factories and wholesale houses have transacted 50,000 to 60,000 bolts of grey cloth, pongee, colored cloth, and bleached cloth, etc. The Zhejiang Road Wen and Yong groups have transacted more than 200 pieces of coarse cloth, twill, and colored cloth, etc. The North Road Yan and Jin groups have transacted nearly 100 pieces of blue cloth, bleached cloth, and serge, etc. The Guangdong and Yunnan groups have transacted 100 to 130 pieces of blue cloth, colored twill, and printed cloth. On the 5th, 225 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong and 55 pieces were shipped to Singapore.</p>
<h3>Grains: Foreign Rice Rushes Up and Then Quickly Declines</h3>
<p>The rice market was exceptionally turbulent yesterday morning, rising and falling twice, totaling two yuan. In the end, there was no glory or shame. At the morning opening, continuing the rising momentum of the previous afternoon, confidence was very firm. Inland Shao and Yong groups and rural customers immediately searched for it everywhere. The buying interest in foreign rice was strong, rising steadily. Later, the news that the gold price had risen to 6,600 yuan led to speculators fueling the fire, absorbing endlessly, and suddenly the entire market was in chaos. The situation became increasingly chaotic, and cries of prices soared. Number 1 Chen Saigon reached 57 yuan, Number 2 was 54.5 yuan, Huo Jiao was 55.5 yuan, Number 2 was 54 yuan, Xiao Jiao was 53.5 yuan, and Tokyo polished rice was 53 yuan. However, the chaos and noise meant that you could say anything, and the market had no standard. Such unrestricted price increases caused people to be wary. The previous prices were not realized, and sales were frustrated. People stood by and watched. Then the market changed, and the market quickly showed a soft trend again, with more sellers than buyers and abundant market goods. Furthermore, general customers and vendors, on the edge of the holiday, desperately needed funds and sold off one after another. In an instant, it suddenly fell by two yuan. By the noon market closing, the prices of all kinds of foreign rice were the same as the previous market. In the afternoon, the buying appetite from all parties was still weak, and the market continued to soften. Number 2 fell from 53.5 yuan to around 52 yuan, Xiao Jiao fell from 53 yuan to around 51.5 yuan, and Number 2 Saigon fell from 54.4 yuan to 53 yuan. The closing market situation was still soft. Siamese rice still had telegrams, and Xiao Jiao rice was quoted at 61 yuan. Yesterday, there was a counteroffer of 60 yuan for 4,000 electric orders. If an agreement can be reached, the market will fall in the future.</p>
<p>Foreign rice arrived in Shanghai again yesterday, transported by Jardine Matheson's Yong Sheng ship from Hong Kong, totaling 6,260 bags, and docked at the Roosevelt Wharf in the French Concession to unload.</p>
<p>There were no domestic rice shipments of thick or thin Japonica rice yesterday. Off-market rumors said that the holiday rush had been too high, with special Japonica rice approaching the 60 yuan mark. General customers felt that it was difficult to promote sales, and transactions decreased suddenly. The situation felt weak. Chang group Wuxi special clear Japonica rice was 589 yuan. Chang Kun Japonica special was 578 yuan, second grade was 556 yuan, Qing Si thick and thin was 556 yuan, and Nan Gang early rice was 55.5 yuan.</p>
<p>The market for glutinous rice was also good and shouted vigorously during the initial rise of foreign rice in the morning, but later failed to take off, and due to the fatigue of other goods, it also slackened. The results showed that the actual prices remained unchanged, with no difference. Jin Li special was still 47 yuan, Chang Dan white was 456 yuan, and Jiang Bei white was 434 yuan.</p>
<h3>Flour Mills Limit Supply to Customers</h3>
<p>The flour market continued to be firm and strong. The price for Number 1 flour mill remained at 13.8 yuan, and the price for customer purchases gradually became strong. Although it was as high as 15.75 yuan, the supply was still limited. It was heard that both northern and southern groups had sporadic purchases, and local retail transactions also increased. This is because the flour inventory in the inland is almost exhausted, and the Shun Feng brand had already opened at more than 13.8 yuan, but it had not yet been sold. The number of old car brand recycled goods has also decreased. The tightness of the market is truly due to problems with the source of new wheat. Although remedial measures are being prepared, there is still no sign of transport.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains: Min Group Actively Purchases New Broad Beans; Soybean Market Advances Strongly</h3>
<p>The new broad beans are not arriving in large quantities, and transactions are mostly negotiated off-market. It was heard that the Jiading white-skinned broad beans and Qing-skinned broad beans that arrived the previous day were traded the previous night, purchased by the Xiamen and Quanzhou groups. The white-skinned beans were priced at 19 yuan due to slightly heavy mud, and the North Sea group temporarily took a wait-and-see approach. The Qing-skinned beans were priced at 19.5 yuan. Yesterday, the local merchants inquired about more than 150 bags of white-skinned beans, priced at 19 yuan and 17 yuan. The Guang group and local merchants took more than 300 bags of Qing-skinned and white beans, priced at 20 yuan for the local merchants and 20.8 yuan for the Bei Gang. The soybean market is moving steadily upwards. Oil pressing plants and sales outlets are very popular due to rising oil prices and excellent bean cakes. Therefore, both Japanese and Chinese merchants have eager buying appetite. The number of exports from local merchants is even greater, but the buying interest is strong and sellers are short, so the number of transactions has decreased. In the end, only more than 4,000 bags of various beans were traded.</p>
<p>On the 5th, 189 bags of beans were exported to Hong Kong, 780 bags were exported to Singapore, and 500 cans of vegetable oil were exported to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Foreign Sugar Slightly Up</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend remained tight. At the association's opening, prices were initially firm but later softened. Spot prices for second-grade coarse white local warehouse goods reached 75 yuan in the morning, and 73.8 yuan in the afternoon, an increase of 1.8 yuan compared to the morning of the previous day. Foreign warehouse goods rose about one yuan in the morning, initially at 74.4 to 74.7 yuan, then to 74.2 yuan, before easing back to 73.5 yuan in the afternoon, only a slight increase of 0.1 yuan compared to the previous day. Spot transshipment goods started at 60.3 to 60 yuan, then rose to 59 yuan, an increase of 0.5 yuan. Fourteenth day warehouse receipts were at 61.2 to 60 yuan, a rise of about one yuan. Taikoo Granulated White B mark was at 85.3 yuan, up 1.3 yuan. H mark car red was at 60 yuan, Dutch red was at 62 yuan, up one yuan. Our factory’s snow-white sugar was at 74.5 yuan, up 2.5 yuan.

<h3>The Ever-Changing Nature of Love</h3>

<p>It is necessary for a man's energy to continuously increase…</p>
<p>Although it is said: "Do not be fickle like Qin in the morning and Chu in the evening," neither men nor women should do such things. However, it is human nature to like the new and dislike the old. Therefore, a clever wife will always change her clothes, her appearance, and the furnishings and arrangements in the home. Sometimes, she may even change the terms, gestures, expressions, and smiles she uses in their love life... all to win her husband's favor. How fortunate is the husband to have such a clever and wonderful wife!</p>
<p>Because human nature is to like the new and dislike the old, love needs to be ever-changing. If it is always the same old thing, the husband of a dull wife may cry out with the sentiment of "domestic flowers are not as fragrant as wildflowers!" This is from the wife's perspective. From the husband's perspective: Men are in a proactive position in marital love, especially in the era of modern women. If the wife is using her loving skills, and the husband cannot harmonize with them, making the love life joyful and coordinated, this is most irritating to the wife. However, if a husband wants to make his marital love life fulfilling, in addition to love skills, he also needs a healthy body and abundant energy. Only then can the couple's life be like glue, full of joy and pleasure from morning to night, giving birth to clever children, and forming a happy family. How wonderful is this! However, if a man has committed self-indulgence, nocturnal emission, or promiscuous indulgence in his early years, and has depleted the endocrine fluid in his reproductive glands, then symptoms such as impotence, incomplete development, scattered energy, neurasthenia, thin sperm and infertility, and premature aging will successively arise. Such a sick husband, the more he has a charming wife and beautiful concubines, the more he will bungle things in their love life, or even be completely unable to perform, making the couple's relationship nominal. Over time, this will cause her to waste her youth and sacrifice the happiness of her life. How can this not arouse her hatred, leading to various family tragedies such as elopement and divorce?</p>
<p>Love is moving forward in an ever-changing way, and it is necessary for a man's energy to continuously increase. If a man already has the above-mentioned symptoms, he must take decisive action to completely cure his hidden ailments, and never procrastinate and mislead himself and others! The treatment method for the above-mentioned symptoms is that world-renowned doctors all recommend taking the reproductive gland reciprocation preparation "Shengzhi Hu" as the most effective and targeted treatment. This agent is based on the most advanced supplementation therapy principle in modern medicine. It extracts the endocrine essence from the reproductive glands of strong animals such as apes, gorillas, tigers, wolves, bears, deer, and sea dogs, and is refined into an agent using scientific replication methods. Therefore, the value of its quality and the certainty of its efficacy are unmatched by any similar preparation. Therefore, after taking it, a man can produce sperm and tonify the kidneys, invigorate the brain and blood overnight. Continued use will further promote development, nourish nerves, and regulate metabolism, and will surely cure all symptoms in the short term. It will strengthen energy and make love fulfilling. Only those with nocturnal emission must also take "Hximituo's Essence-Consolidating Tablets" (available at large pharmacies such as Sino-Western Wuzhou Huamei Taihe) to consolidate the essence gate, stop leakage, and achieve even faster results.</p>
<p>Beauty</p>
<h3>The Source of Happiness is the Breasts</h3>
<p>— American Medical Doctorate Yao Chongpei</p>
<p>Having bathed, she ventures out for an evening stroll,</p>
<p>Her graceful figure surpassing all others,</p>
<p>The twin peaks subtly revealed beneath her attire,</p>
<p>Capturing the gaze of every passerby.</p>
<p>Clad in the sheerest of garments, her silhouette is so enchanting, her curves so defined. Adding to this, her breasts, gently rising and falling beneath the thin fabric, evoke envy and secret admiration. Indeed, the love of beauty is an innate human desire. No matter how foolish one may be, the sight of a healthy, beautiful woman, a woman with well-developed features, evokes admiration. In today's world, where "healthy beauty" for women is highly touted, they are seen as angels from heaven, or treasures of society. Everyone shows them respect and care, giving them an advantage in social settings. Broadly speaking, in any circumstance, they enjoy material and spiritual fulfillment and pleasure.</p>
<p>But, let's consider the other side. "Healthy beauty" is not something every woman possesses. If a woman has previously suffered from chest binding, menstrual irregularities, leucorrhea, anemia, hemoptysis, or severe illnesses, the function of her reproductive glands and ovaries will be impaired. This will affect her metabolism, and her breasts will not develop properly. Even if they have developed well, they will gradually atrophy, becoming as flat as a man's. At the same time, her hips will become thin and lacking in flesh, losing their roundness and fullness. The loveliness of a woman, to put it plainly, lies entirely in her breasts and hips. If her breasts are as flat as a man's, where is the beauty that would cause infatuation and adoration? Therefore, women who have lost their healthy beauty, despite past happiness, often face a tragic fate. As for remedies, both Chinese and Western doctors agree that taking women's "Germinal Essence" is the most effective treatment. This agent was invented by German Doctor Staner, and its noble ingredients and precise formulation surpass any other endocrine preparation. Once taken, it exerts a powerful effect within 24 hours, regulating menstruation and developing mammary glands. Continued use will surely conquer the above symptoms, making the breasts round and high, the cheeks rosy, and maintaining youthfulness.</p>
<h3>Effective Treatment for Spermatorrhea</h3>
<p>— Sexually Transmitted Disease Specialist Zhan Nianceng</p>
<p>Some say that spermatorrhea in young men is not a disease. Others say that while it is a disease, it is difficult to treat. These two misconceptions exist in the minds of young men with spermatorrhea, delaying the treatment and harming their futures! Spermatorrhea may not be a disease, but it can cost a life! A certain expert physician once said in a research report, "One instance of spermatorrhea is worse than losing a pound of blood!" Its severity is such that spermatorrhea is not comparable to ordinary diseases; it is simply the most harmful disease. However, while spermatorrhea is the most harmful disease, it is not a difficult disease to treat. Ordinary people call it difficult to treat because they do not understand the root cause and have no effective medicines. According to our investigations, countless young men with spermatorrhea are fooled by incompetent doctors, wasting time and money and delaying treatment. As a result, spermatorrhea increases daily, and the nervous system weakens. Symptoms such as weakened memory, insomnia, palpitations, lower back pain, incomplete development, and premature aging arise, burying their youth and delaying their futures. Is this not tragic?</p>
<p>The reason why young people suffer from spermatorrhea is mostly due to masturbation, excessive indulgence, or overwork, which injures the sexual nerves and causes the spermatic duct to relax. Knowing this root cause, the treatment must focus on strengthening the spermatic duct. Taking "Hymitol's Spermatic Solidifying Pills" has the specific effect of strengthening the spermatic duct, calming the nerves, and stopping spermatorrhea. According to my experience, I have used this agent to cure tens of thousands of spermatorrhea patients. However, for those who have had spermatorrhea for a long time and have the above symptoms, it is necessary to also take the gonadotrophic hormone preparation "Germinal Essence" to nourish the brain, kidneys, sperm, blood, and nerves. Taking it continuously for a month will surely eliminate all ailments and double their energy. This is truly the most effective treatment for spermatorrhea, treating both the symptoms and the root cause. Patients who can come to my clinic in person for treatment will find it especially reliable, with visible results in days.</p>
<h3>Ironclad Facts</h3>
<p>— Sexually Transmitted Disease Specialist Zhan Nianceng Records</p>
<p>(1) Young men with spermatorrhea should not delay treatment</p>
<p>Mr. Qiao Rongzu, 20 years old, from Ningbo, came to Shanghai last year due to the frequent bombings in his hometown. He boarded at a certain middle school in Shanghai. However, the environment in Shanghai was too dissolute, and the school lacked good educational facilities. Boarding students could often go out for leisure. Once, he was pulled into prostitution and aroused lustful thoughts, resulting in masturbation. He did not know that once masturbation becomes a habit, it is easy to cause the spermatic duct to relax and trigger spermatorrhea. Initially, it was only two or three times a month, but gradually increased to five or six or ten times. As a result, his face was sallow, his memory was poor, his head was dizzy and achy, he had tinnitus and blurred vision, his limbs were tired, and he had lower back pain. His schoolwork also plummeted as a result. Before the spring break, he failed the exams. Mr. Qiao now realized the harm of masturbation and spermatorrhea, but repeatedly taking over-the-counter medicines had little effect. Last month, he came to my clinic for treatment, determined to cure his disease. After a detailed examination by an expert physician, it was determined that it was indeed due to untreated spermatorrhea. He was immediately instructed to go to the Sino-Western Pharmacy to purchase two boxes of the special spermatorrhea drug "Hymitol's Spermatic Solidifying Pills" and two dozen of the gonadotrophic hormone preparation "Germinal Essence" to take together. He was also given "Diement's" electrotherapy every other day. After three weeks of careful treatment, his spirits were revitalized, his mind was clear, and the above symptoms had completely disappeared.</p>
<p>(2) The husband's sorrow after marriage</p>
<p>Mr. Gao Ming, 26 years old, got married last winter. There has never been harmony between the couple because Mr. Gao developed impotence after marriage and had slight spermatorrhea. The couple's relationship was unusually poor, but Mr. Gao's inner pain could not be described in words. Although he had taken so-called "kidney tonifying and sperm producing endocrine agents" on the market with little effect, he was even more frustrated! Last month, introduced by his friend (his friend Mr. Gu also cured his hidden illness at this clinic), he came to my clinic for treatment. After examining his condition, he was instructed to purchase three dozen of the gonadotrophic hormone preparation "Germinal Essence" and one box of "Hymitol's Spermatic Solidifying Pills" to take together. He was also given daily electrotherapy and injections of new medical techniques. A month has passed, and he is now strong and vigorous, and the couple's love is indescribable.</p>

<h3>Statement by the French Concession Taxpayers' Association: Increased Taxes are Unbearable, May Cause Rent Increases and High Prices. Letter to the French Municipal Council Requesting Reconsideration, and Appointing Representatives to Negotiate with Authorities to Restrict Rent Increases.</h3>
<p>The French Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association, in view of the difficult living conditions of residents within the concession, sent a special letter to the French Municipal Council yesterday regarding the implementation of increased taxes starting next month, requesting reconsideration and urging price stabilization. They also resolved to appoint four representatives to be responsible for negotiating with the authorities to restrict illegal rent increases, in order to stabilize the livelihood of residents within the concession. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Ordinary Tax Increases are Beyond Capacity</p>
<p>The French Municipal Council, in order to balance the budget, has decided to increase land tax, house tax, vehicle tax, etc., starting July 1st, to supplement funds. However, at this time of difficult living, taxpayers feel unable to bear the burden. The French Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association, in addition to requesting the Chinese director of the council to negotiate reasonably, sent a special letter to the Municipal Council yesterday, requesting reconsideration. The original letter stated: "Respectfully, we have learned that your council intends to implement a general increase in various taxes, such as land tax, house tax, and vehicle licenses, starting July 1st of this year. The rate of increase is as high as 40% or more, which is an unprecedented precedent. Since the westward shift of the war, Shanghai has become an isolated island. Our French Concession is in a corner, and the number of residents has increased sharply. Various businesses show signs of prosperity, but examining the overall social situation, there is a risk of gradual depletion. The people are struggling to make a living, which is deeply worrying. The rate of increase in land tax and house tax is particularly large this time. Landlords are bound to use this as an excuse to increase rents even more. At this time, tenants will naturally be unable to afford it. Therefore, rent disputes will continue to escalate. Furthermore, if the increased taxes trigger another rise in prices, it will not only run counter to the principle of stabilizing prices, but also affect the security of the concession. Moreover, previous council settlements have shown annual surpluses, and this tax increase seems unnecessary. While increasing revenue is important, reducing expenditure is also essential. We respectfully submit our humble opinions, hoping that your council will prioritize the livelihood of the people and reconsider it carefully. We specially send this letter, hoping for a reply."</p>
<p>Urging Restrictions on Illegal Rent Increases</p>
<p>The French Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association, in view of the repeated occurrence of landlords increasing rents within the concession, and the citizens being unable to bear the soaring prices, has led to repeated disputes. The committee members have repeatedly discussed and reached a result, appointing four representatives to be responsible for negotiating with the French authorities to restrict illegal rent increases. These four representatives are two landlords and two tenants, to study and obtain a fair method through both sides, so that opportunists have no excuse. The representatives decided yesterday include Mr. Xu Maotang as one of the landlords, and the remaining landlord and two tenants are still being sought.</p>
<h3>Rise of Bankrupt Yarn Companies, Reaching 90, 30 Already Liquidated, 60 Not Yet Announced</h3>
<p>Black market speculation in cotton yarn is rampant, and yarn prices are fluctuating drastically, causing many companies to lose money and go bankrupt. Yesterday, Rende, Shenyu, and Dinglong also announced the suspension of business and liquidation, and the hidden worries have not subsided.</p>
<p>After the Shanghai War</p>
<p>Yarn manufacturers, initially for the convenience of buying and selling spot goods, established a tea party-style dark market through the business research association of the Yarn Industry Association, specializing in spot transactions and strictly complying with government orders not to engage in futures. However, it did not take long for unscrupulous elements in the yarn industry to seize the opportunity and illegally establish so-called "Intermediary Societies," turning the spot organization into an illegal futures trading market. Moreover, they bought and sold Japanese yarn, attracting more than 300 outside participants. There were also</p>
<p>four to five hundred</p>
<p>who participated in the market under the names of other companies without formally joining. These people in the market only cared about their own interests and disregarded national laws and the people's livelihood. The Ministries of Finance and Economic Affairs repeatedly ordered them to prohibit trading in futures and Japanese yarn, but they turned a deaf ear and continued to operate as usual, intensifying blind speculation, disrupting the market, and leading to suicides and bankruptcies due to manipulation and speculation by certain large yarn companies. Last month, the yarn price jumped from 800 yuan to 1,800 yuan, and then fell to 1,200 yuan,</p>
<p>causing all bulls and bears</p>
<p>to suffer huge losses. Therefore, bankruptcies have been rising until now. It is reported that about 30 companies have announced liquidation, and about 60 have not yet announced liquidation. These are all those who failed in trading Japanese yarn and are not legitimate yarn merchants of the Yarn Exchange. Those who failed and went bankrupt this time</p>
<p>speculated in "Moon Harp"</p>
<p>Japanese yarn last month, with an average of about 3,000 bales of "Moon Harp" Japanese yarn per company. It is also learned that the</p>
<p>debts</p>
<p>of each bankrupt yarn company range from 50,000 to 300,000 yuan, and some even have debts of several million yuan. Among them, some have indeed gone bankrupt due to losses, while others have deliberately taken the opportunity to go bankrupt.</p>
<h3>British Troops Capture Two Thugs, Confiscate Important Documents, Currently Studying Documents and Firearms, May Have Shocking Revelations</h3>
<p>The North-China Daily News reported that yesterday (3rd) at 9:10 am, a team of the 2nd Battalion of the British East Surrey Regiment was patrolling along Edinburgh Road when a group of armed Chinese men without uniforms scattered and fled as the patrol approached. However, two were captured by British soldiers, one</p>
<p>carrying a gun and ammunition</p>
<p>and several documents of significant importance were seized from his person. The British military authorities are still detaining the two men and are investigating with the Shanghai Municipal Police. The China Press also reported that the Shanghai Municipal Police continued to study the firearms and documents seized by the British troops this morning (4th), and the details are unknown. According to a police officer, the seized firearms cannot be identified in a short time, and the documents will also take several days</p>
<p>to translate.</p>
<p>Because the police investigation has not been completed, no news has been released. One theory is that the two arrested men are related to secret political plots. Their arrest will have shocking revelations. The two men are still being detained by the East Surrey Regiment and are expected to be handed over to the police for questioning in court.</p>
<h3>13 Bridges on the Shanghai-Wuxi Highway Have Been Burned, New Fourth Army Operates in the Changshu Area, White Bridge Construction is Huge and Difficult to Repair</h3>
<p>According to recent reports from the countryside, the Changshu section of the Shanghai-Wuxi Highway has been severely damaged by the New Fourth Army, with as many as 13 bridges of various sizes burned. Traffic on the road has been stopped for four days and is unlikely to return to normal in a short time. Since the Shanghai-Wuxi Highway fell into Japanese hands, it has been relied on as a key transportation route for troops. The "Central China Railway Company" operated by the Japanese also opened vehicles to travel between Suzhou, Wuxi, Shanghai, and Changshu, earning considerable profits.</p>
<p>The Suzhou-Changshu section</p>
<p>has been repeatedly damaged by guerrillas, but was eventually blocked by the Japanese army, who converted the river into a mud dam for forced passage. Recently, the New Fourth Army learned that the Japanese army was about to make a large-scale deployment, so on the night of the 1st of this month, they sent mobile troops from the west to destroy a large number of bridges on the Changshu section, from Bridge No. 62 in Zhitang to Bridge No. 49 in Gulicun, all burned down, and the burning</p>
<p>lasted a whole day.</p>
<p>Although Japanese troops were stationed in the nearby town of Zhitang, they did not dare to attack due to the planned actions of the Chinese army. It was not until noon the next day that they went out and forced the villagers to extinguish the fire. After the incident, residents along the line, such as Zhitang, Baimao, Zhitang, and Yaozhen, were concerned about this situation and feared that it would lead to combat, so they moved one after another. It was then learned that the purpose of the Chinese army was to disrupt the Japanese army's transportation line, so after the event, they still</p>
<p>retreated westward.</p>
<p>In order to maintain transportation, the Japanese army urgently needs to repair the damaged bridges, but the White Bridge is a huge project, and the river is difficult to block with mud due to tidal influences. It is estimated to take at least two months. The "Central China Railway Company's" passenger cars have stopped, and the Shanghai-Changshu transport companies operated by the Chinese have changed their routes to transport goods.</p>
<h3>Safety Movement, Jointly Promoted</h3>
<p>Due to the sharp increase in Shanghai's population after the war and the frequent traffic on the roads, the Municipal Council launched a Safe Driving Week from June 18th to 24th last year to reduce traffic accidents. In the past year, accidents have been reduced. Therefore, it is scheduled to continue the safety campaign with the French Concession authorities starting on the 18th of this month. The organization is divided into Chinese Motor Vehicle Group, Private Car Group, Motorcycle Group, Trolley Group, and Rickshaw Group, inviting responsible persons from all parties to guide the work of each group. The Traffic Department and Police Department of the Municipal Council also jointly formulated publicity methods. At that time, in addition to posting slogans and leaflets on vehicles and utility poles, it was also decided to screen movies, broadcast publicity, and mobilize Boy Scouts to guide pedestrian traffic on various roads.</p>
<h3>Zha Peilin et al. Donate to the Belgian Red Cross</h3>
<p>The Belgian Red Cross has raised $116,383.50 in Chinese currency in China as of recently. Among them, Zha Peilin, Director of the Shanghai Postal Bureau, donated 100 yuan in foreign currency, and Fap, Director of the French Concession Police Department, donated 100 yuan. Other foreign currency donations included 127,681.25 Belgian francs, 3,500 French francs, 39 pounds and 1 penny in British gold, and 695 US dollars.</p>
<h3>Xue Gengxin's Resignation Approved</h3>
<p>Xue Gengxin, Chief Translator and Inspector of the Political Department of the French Police Department, has been hospitalized for more than a month due to illness caused by overwork. Now that he urgently needs to recuperate, he has submitted his resignation, which has been approved.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Maritime Customs Port Affairs Department Dredges the Huangpu Waterway, First Carried Out in Two Steps in the Chenjiazhui Area, Stipulating Navigation Measures for the Construction Area</h3>
<p>In view of the urgent need to dredge the Huangpu River waterway to facilitate navigation and traffic, the Shanghai Maritime Customs has dispatched the dredger Haihu from the Port Affairs Department to dredge the main waterway in the Chenjiazhui area starting yesterday. The announcement is recorded as follows: "The dredger Haihu of the Shanghai Dredging Bureau will carry out dredging work in the main waterway of the Huangpu River in the Chenjiazhui area, from about 3,800 feet downstream of the Donggou Buoy (New Waterway No. 6 Buoy of Gaoqiao Sand) to about 2,200 feet upstream of the Donggou Buoy.</p>
<p>This dredging</p>
<p>project is scheduled to start on June 4th of this year, and will be carried out in two steps. The first step is to dredge the Shanghai riverbank in the above area, from the lower end to the upstream. The second step is to dredge the Pudong riverbank, also from the lower end to the upstream. When the dredger is working and resting, it will moor in the deep waterway near Shanghai or Pudong in the above area. During this project, ship operators navigating ships in the Huangpu River should</p>
<p>be extremely cautious</p>
<p>when approaching the dredger. Keep safe at the slowest possible speed and sound a long whistle so that the dredger's master can assess the situation and stop the dredger from moving sideways. The working signals of the dredger shown in this department's Announcement No. 10 of August 25, 1932, must be noted. In addition to the previous signals, a white sign is hung at both ends of the dredger, marked with the word "Dredger," and lights are used at night for illumination. In addition, all navigators</p>
<p>must not ignore</p>
<p>that there are two lateral anchor chains on the side of the dredger close to the waterway. Therefore, passing ships should not get too close to the dredger. Also, when ships are approaching the dredger, the ship behind must not overtake the ship in front or pass the oncoming ship. The drawing of this dredging project can be obtained from the department and the Pilotage Association, or the Engineering Department of the Dredging Bureau. Let all navigators know this and hold this announcement."</p>

<h3>Ningbo and Shaoxing Native Place Associations Discuss Relief for Rice Shortage, Shanghai-Ningbo Ships Still Plan to Increase Freight, Drought in Shiqi Leads to Hopeless Harvest</h3>
<p>The Ningbo Shanghai Native Place Association, to solicit donations for rice at low prices in Ningbo, the chairman committee Yu Qiaqing, Qin Runxiang, Zhang Jixian, etc., scheduled to convene a Ningbo fellow townspeople appeal conference on the 7th of this month, yesterday issued a notice saying: "Our Ningbo has a small area and dense population, and the food supply has always been insufficient. Recently, due to the exhaustion of rice sources, there is a sudden panic. In mid-last month, the price of rice soared to more than 60 yuan, and there is no worry about buying it. Small people can hardly make a living. And when the spring sowing season is now approaching, there has been little rain, and most of the early rice has withered, making people uneasy and worried every day. The welfare of our native place is closely related to us. In addition to the active fund-raising of rice transportation to help and organize flat prices, this matter is important and relies on the efforts of all to be effective. We have set a special time at five o'clock on the afternoon of the 7th of this month to hold a fundraising conference at this association. All our fellow townspeople who are enthusiastic will participate together to support justice and will be grateful."</p>
<p>Shipping Freight Still Planned to Increase</p>
<p>The Ningbo People's Food Relief Association, in view of the severe rice shortage, plans to levy a 5% relief fee on all imports and exports and imported goods in the warehouse that have not been collected, according to customs valuation. However, due to the firm opposition of fellow townspeople in Shanghai, it was decided to change the Shanghai-Ningbo ships to increase the shipping freight by 50% back and forth for relief. The local Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to Shanghai to Yu Qiaqing seeking opinions. At that time, Yu replied that he did not agree, advocated more donations, and first advanced 500,000 yuan from Shanghai to order 18,000 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, which was loaded on the Granton wheel and went directly from Hong Kong to Ningbo. At the same time, the steps were decided to prepare to order a total of 100,000 bags of rice in two steps for relief. The Xin Sheng News reporter inquired from the shipping industry that the Ningbo People's Food Relief Association plans to implement a relief fee on all import and export ships from the 6th of this month, adding 50% to the shipping freight to meet the needs of relieving the people's food.</p>
<p>Transporting Rice to Help Shaoxing Civilians</p>
<p>The Shaoxing Seven Counties Shanghai Native Place Association, because a person from Shaoxing entrusted the transportation of foreign rice to Shaoxing for relief, the association raised funds and purchased a large amount of tribute rice in Shanghai and loaded it onto ships for transportation, a total of 3,996 bags. Except for 1,990 bags that have arrived at their destinations, the remaining 2,000 bags will arrive in Ningbo today. The association has sent personnel to Ningbo to transfer it to Shaoxing. Another 1,500 bags are still being purchased and may be shipped within days. However, the transportation costs and losses of the grain are borne by the association in half. It is heard that the Zhejiang Provincial Government has purchased a large amount of national rice from Jiangxi and Taizhou and transported it to Shaoxing for relief. Shaoxing and Shangyu are the most in need of rice.</p>
<p>Ningbo Promotes Group Rice Purchases</p>
<p>The Ningbo Shanghai Native Place Association held a meeting of the Executive Committee of the Flat-Price Fundraising Committee yesterday. Liu Liangcai proposed to cable each chamber of commerce in Ningbo to urge all industries to actively promote group rice purchases, so that the source is solid and the price of grain can be suppressed, and to persuade all industries to order as much as possible, at least half a year's food for each shop, for regulation. The public passed the resolution and has sent a telegram to the chambers of commerce in Ningbo County today.</p>
<p>Shiqi Sends Personnel to Shanghai to Raise Funds</p>
<p>The rice shortage in the Ningbo countryside has led to rice riots one after another. Villagers are filling their bellies with chaff and bran. The tragic situation has been repeatedly reported in this newspaper. It is now heard that the rice shortage in the southwest of Ningbo, the Shiqi Town Suoma Township, is particularly severe. Recently, due to drought, the fields have become cracked, the harvest is hopeless, and people are uneasy. The town chief of the town, Chen Xiaolu, is trying to provide relief and came to Shanghai the day before yesterday to solicit donations, buy rice and transport it to Ningbo at a flat price. It is also heard that in recent days, there are quite a few native townspeople in Shanghai and enthusiastic people from all walks of life who have automatically donated.</p>
<h3>French Concession Bakers Fined for Raising Prices</h3>
<p>The China Press reported that a committee composed of representatives from the French Concession Price Equalization Committee and the French Police Department went to several bakeries and daily necessities stores yesterday (3rd) to investigate and found that several stores had raised prices in the past month due to the fall in the French currency and were fined accordingly.</p>
<h3>US Cruiser Marblehead May Sail to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The China Press reported that the US Asiatic Fleet light cruiser Marblehead is expected to sail from Manila to Shanghai next week, but this has not been confirmed by naval circles in the city, as news of US ships' movements is only released within 48 hours. It is also heard that the flagship of the US Asiatic Fleet, the Augusta, will sail to Qinhuangdao on June 12, and the US ship Isherwood, which goes to various ports along the Yangtze River, is scheduled to return to Shanghai on the 9th and may sail north with the Augusta.</p>
<h3>Change of Commander of the British Far East Fleet: Rear Admiral Layton to Succeed, Admiral Noble Recalled to England, Layton Expected to Take Office in Early September</h3>
<p>Admiral Noble, Commander of the British Far East Fleet, has been serving in the Far East for over two years since taking office in February 1938 (according to the original term of office for the British Naval Commander's foreign assignment, which is two years, but sometimes the term can be extended due to environmental factors). Reliable sources now indicate that Admiral Noble has been recalled to England for another important mission. The position of Commander of the Far East Fleet left vacant will be taken over by Rear Admiral Layton, newly appointed by the British authorities. Layton is scheduled to receive his new post on the 10th of next month at the defense headquarters, and will leave Europe for the Far East on August 1st, expected to arrive in Hong Kong in early September to take office. It is reported that Layton was stationed in the Mediterranean when the Second European War broke out, and this new appointment was also received at the Mediterranean defense headquarters. It is not yet known whether Layton is still in the Mediterranean, as the whereabouts of naval personnel are kept strictly confidential during wartime.</p>
<h3>British Residents in Shanghai Await Orders to Enlist</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the European war, the British Consulate has announced that young and strong British residents in Shanghai have been actively returning to their country to participate in the war. Other British residents, regardless of age or gender, are also highly motivated by patriotic enthusiasm and are willing to serve their country. According to a message released yesterday by the British Consulate in Shanghai, "Since the outbreak of the European war, the British government has authorized the British Ambassador to inform British residents that those who wish to return to England to participate in the war can first exert their patriotic enthusiasm in the British dominions as much as possible, or represent the interests of the British Crown in the region where the expatriates are currently located, to provide better service. As the European war has gradually expanded, the British Consul-General in Shanghai has also informed the government of the expatriates' willingness to return to their country to participate in service in any capacity, and asked the government if it would object to raising funds in Shanghai to help them achieve their goals if it is inconvenient to arrange for these volunteer teams to return to England. The British government has now relayed a telegram through the British Embassy, ​​stating that the government is considering conscripting British expatriates from remote areas, and has no objection to local fundraising to help British expatriates return to their country, but they must wait for further instructions before boarding ships to return home."</p>
<h3>French Concession to Levy Match Tax</h3>
<p>Cigarette tax also to be monitored by appointed personnel. The French Consulate General has recently issued an order to levy a unified tax on chemical matches within the French Concession. All chemical match factories located in the French Concession, whether owned by Chinese or foreigners, are required to pay the unified tax. The tax rates are 8 yuan per box for Grade A small box matches, 9 yuan per box for Grade B medium box matches, and 16 yuan per box for Grade C large box matches (each box contains approximately 7,200 matches). It is reported that this unified tax will be levied at the factory and will be implemented soon. The cigarette unified tax inspection office under the French Municipal Council will also send one person to each factory to carry out the responsibility of supervision. The method of taxation is that the Donation Office of the French Public Works Bureau will sell stamp tickets, which will be affixed to the boxes as proof. Boxes without stamp tickets will be considered contraband and will be fined from two to thirty times the original tax amount, and will also be subject to a fine of 5 yuan to 500 yuan.</p>
<h3>Japanese Merchant "Market" Transporting Salted Pork Suddenly Attacked by Civilian Boats, Armed Robbery, Japanese Escorting Goods Beaten and Injured, Serious Case of Power Struggle</h3>
<p>According to the Social News Agency, at around 4:00 PM on the third, five Japanese staff members from the "Shanghai Food Market," a Japanese merchant located at No. 61 Wusong Road, escorted three hundred head of salted pork on a small boat to the Pudong Public Wharf. Unexpectedly, three small boats carrying over two hundred men armed with iron rods and other weapons suddenly arrived and surrounded the Japanese merchant's pork boat. The five Japanese escorting the pork were beaten and injured, and the attackers fled immediately after shouting. After the Japanese side received the news, they immediately went to pursue them, but there was no trace of them. The injured were taken to the Muhara Hospital on Lao Baizi Road. The Japanese side learned that the attacking ships were flying the flag of "Central Market," so they are investigating the truth.</p>
<p>Gathering to Rob</p>
<p>According to the Sixth Central News Agency, at 4:00 PM on the [blank space] day (the 3rd), Oyauchi Yuzo, the transportation group leader of the Japanese merchant "Shanghai Food Market" in Wusong, and his group members Hokuhara Asakichi, Kanda Yoshiji, Noda Tatsumi, and Kaizu Takanori, were transporting 300 heads of salted pork from Pudong, intending to unload the goods at the public wharf. Unexpectedly, when they were about 300 meters away from the wharf, three civilian boats flying the false flag of "Central Market" sailed out of Suzhou Creek and surrounded the salted pork boat. About 200 Chinese men, each holding iron weapons, attacked Oyauchi and others. After robbing all 300 heads of salted pork, they fled back upstream on Suzhou Creek. It is said that Oyauchi and others were seriously injured, but their lives are not in danger, and they are being treated at the Taihara Hospital on Lao Baizi Road.</p>
<p>Not the First Time</p>
<p>It is reported that the incident of robbing goods in the Huangpu River is not the first time. About a month ago, there were incidents of robbing pork and other goods. On the 2nd of this month, at 10:00 AM, when a certain ship was transporting salted pork for the "Shanghai Food Market," someone threatened them and ordered them to go to Huishan Wharf. However, none of the previous cases were as serious as this one. It is said that the stolen salted pork is worth no less than 150,000 to 160,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Japanese Interview</p>
<p>After this incident occurred, Oyauchi said that for more than a month, the "Market's" cargo ships often encountered Chinese people claiming to be from the "Central Market" on the way, saying that the goods belonged to the "Central Market" and ordering them to dock at Huishan Wharf. After investigation, there is no trading relationship between the "Market" and the "Central Market," and the "Market" has no reason to have disputes with the "Market." This incident is suspected to be the work of pirate ships flying the flag of the "Central Market." As for whether it was done by employees of the "Central Market," it is impossible to speculate before the authorities have investigated it thoroughly.</p>
<h3>Astonishing Amount of Apple Imports This Spring</h3>
<p>The apples sold in Shanghai mostly come from Japan and Korea. According to the Great Eastern News Agency reporter's inquiry to the Jianghai Customs, the figures are quite considerable. The import value of apples from January to March this year was 239,978 Customs Gold Units, equivalent to 649,620 yuan in national currency. During the same period last year, it was only 119,785 Customs Gold Units, equivalent to only 267,297 yuan in national currency. This year, it is almost more than twice as much. Among the countries importing apples, Japan ranks first, accounting for 130,921 Customs Gold Units, Korea ranks second, accounting for 103,260 Customs Gold Units, and the United States ranks third, accounting for 3,360 Customs Gold Units.</p>
<p>Truly Astonishing</p>
<p>At the same time, Xia Ping, the general affairs section chief of the pseudo-"Central Market," also gave a statement, saying that the incident of pirate ships flying the flag of the "Central Market" and attacking the "Shanghai Food Market" was heard for the first time. He believes that this kind of violent incident must have been done by unscrupulous elements, and they have no motivation or reason to do so. However, it is also a fact that there has been some confusion in the salted pork transaction between the "Central Market" and the "Shanghai Market" since the beginning of last month, which has not yet been resolved. And the goods robbed from the "Shanghai Market" this time happened to be salted pork, which is truly amazing. He hopes that the world will not misunderstand because of this.</p>
<p>Case Speculation</p>
<p>The reporter believes that this matter is indeed very peculiar, and consulted those who are familiar with the local situation in Shanghai for their views. According to them, although incidents of robbery in the Huangpu River occur occasionally, the large-scale operation of this case is indeed rare. Moreover, the robbers did not escape in different directions in the river, but still returned upstream on Suzhou Creek in three ships, without considering that the principal might report to the authorities to pursue and intercept them, which is even more strange. Based on this, we judge the case and think it is half understood.</p>
<h3>Java Conscripts Young Men</h3>
<p>A Group of Overseas Chinese Conscripted into the Army, Limited to Carrying 500 Guilders Out of the Country. The Chibadak ship of the Java Mailboat Company left Southeast Asia and sailed to Shanghai after the Netherlands became involved in the war. According to the overseas Chinese who took the ship to Shanghai, after the Netherlands was drawn into the whirlpool and then the situation in the Dutch East Indies became tense, the Java authorities have taken all wartime measures. Recently, it has been stipulated that young men should be conscripted to defend the local area, and foreigners are also included in the conscription. The method is that each shop must transfer one young man to be trained by the Java authorities for the needs of defending the country when necessary. Therefore, not a few overseas Chinese have been conscripted. The first batch has been conscripted into the army. As for the business of the stores, they have stopped operating at night due to the implementation of lighting control.</p>
<p>Restrictions on Foreigners Taking Silver Out of the Country</p>
<p>In order to implement wartime financial management, the Java authorities have restricted foreigners from taking silver out of the country. The limit is 500 Dutch guilders per person. More will be confiscated. Therefore, the overseas Chinese returning to their country this time cannot carry Dutch currency out of the country without restrictions. The authorities have now imposed control over various items in Java. Stores should record the goods sold for verification, and at the same time assess the prices and do not allow merchants to raise prices arbitrarily.</p>
<p>Large Number of Overseas Chinese Preparing to Return Home</p>
<p>Currently, the overseas Chinese in Java are affected and restricted by their business abroad, so most of them are preparing to return home. After the Chibadak, the Chizhalianka ship sailed from Southeast Asia to Shanghai, carrying about a thousand overseas Chinese to Shanghai. It is heard that the ship will arrive in Shanghai around the 10th of this month. The Chibadak ship is scheduled to continue sailing from Shanghai to Southeast Asia on the 6th.</p>

<h3>Sparse Rainfall, Severe Drought in Various Places, Farmland Water Dried Up, Early Rice Cannot Be Planted, No Hope of Rain in Recent Days of Severe Drought</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of spring in Shanghai, there has been little rainfall, and various places are also suffering from severe drought. Most of the farmland has dried up, and early rice cannot be planted. Seedlings that have been transplanted are also withering, and autumn grazing is worrying. Rivers in various places have also cracked due to drought. The general public is hoping for heavy rain to relieve this severe drought. Farmers in Pudong and other places have already banned slaughtering and prayed for rain, hoping to welcome peace. However, according to a reporter from the Great Eastern News Agency who inquired at the Observatory, the sky over Shanghai has been clear and the weather has been hot recently, and there is no hope of rain.

<h3>Regulations of the Ningqun Sericulture Bureau</h3>
<p>Prefect Zong of Ningqun has advocated the establishment of a Sericulture Bureau, and its regulations are as follows: First, a sericulture teaching bureau will be established at Cai Lang Bridge in Yin Nan, with separate rooms for men and women. The men's room will be in Mingxin Temple, and the women's room will be in Lishan Temple. Each will be assigned to their respective locations for class study, to prevent mixing. Second, the bureau will have four silkworm masters and two silkworm women, starting on the seventeenth day of the third month and ending on the seventeenth day of the fourth month, staying at the bureau full-time for sixty days. Third, the price of mulberry leaves is variable. Now that the bureau is established for teaching, it is a matter of public service. All households with mulberry trees should have a sense of urgency and public interest and must not raise prices or hoard them. When silkworms are entering their large sleep or beginning to eat a lot of leaves, officials and gentry in the bureau shall consult and decide on prices fairly, weighing them and paying accordingly. They must not go back on their word or attempt to monopolize, thereby hindering this good deed. Fourth, all silkworm rearing and silk reeling tools must be easy to use. As the saying goes, "To do a good job, one must first sharpen one's tools." Currently, the bureau has selected and purchased one or two of these tools from Huzhou. Those who come to learn with a genuine interest in this matter should observe them carefully to learn how to replicate them. Silk reeling machines are especially important. Knowing how to raise silkworms but not how to reel silk is a common problem in Ningbo. The key lies in not knowing how to build a reeling machine. Those with ambition can discuss the matter with officials and gentry in the bureau after the event, borrow a sample, and hire craftsmen to replicate it. Fifth, diligence and thrift are essential for sericulture. Except for committee members in the bureau, who are allowed to bring one family servant, all other laborers will be hired by the gentry and directors as needed.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Star of Life (3)</h3>
<p>We must also know that it is not only darkness that obscures the stars, making them invisible to us. Can you see the stars during the day? You cannot. This is not because the stars are not there, but because the sunlight is brighter. We only see the sunlight and not the stars. Likewise, it is not only suffering, illness, death, etc., that obscure God, making Him invisible to us. When we are at peace and happy, our eyes filled with worldly glory and wealth, we are also very easily caught in this danger, which is not seeing the star of life. There is a way to see the stars during the day, which is to go down a well and look up at the sky. If we want to see this star of life, which is always close to us and guides us, we must put in the effort, temporarily putting aside worldly affairs and drawing closer to Him. There is also another meaning: this "bright morning star" is a sign of the rising sun. When you are walking at night, feeling hardship and difficulty, cold and lonely, everything feels dull and cumbersome, when you see the morning star appearing in the east, your spirits are renewed, because you know that this dark and dangerous night is about to pass. It is the same when the star Christ rises and shines in our hearts. In other words, when Christ is no longer just an empty name to us, but our best living friend, it is the prelude to the passing of our doubts, sins, selfishness, dangers, and the darkness of death. When we see the morning star, we are happy, not only because the night is going to pass, but also because the day is coming. We know that the sun will rise and shine all over the earth in a short time. When the star Christ shines in our lives, we rejoice, not only because all the suffering of life will pass, but also because the happy days of heaven are coming, when God will wipe away all tears from our eyes and give us eternal happiness.

<h3>Please Forgive Me</h3>
<p>— Editor</p>
<p>Answering Readers Regarding Zhang Yisheng's "Seeking Employment"</p>
<p>First, I must state: I do not know Zhang Yisheng. This can be proven by his second letter. However, the reason I made an exception and published this free advertisement for him is that, on the one hand, I sympathize with his situation, and on the other hand, I feel that many young masters who have such privileged backgrounds treat their studies as a game, even forging checks and stealing coats in dance halls. Seeing such a pitiful student makes them also aware. Moreover, many schools now only know how to increase fees and have no time for work such as rewarding students with excellent academics and conduct, and treating poor students preferentially. Therefore, in addition to "Seeking Employment," I specifically raised this "request."</p>
<p>However, unexpectedly, and to my embarrassment, many letters came hoping to also publish "Seeking Employment" examples. Some even took the initiative, saying that I certainly would not be more generous to him and stingy to them; some suspected that Zhang Yisheng was my relative or friend, otherwise, why would I be so "enthusiastic"? Regardless of whether these words are "inviting" or "provoking," I sympathize with them very much because they hope to find a job under the pressure of rising living standards. However, I really cannot add another "Self-Introduction" column in the current narrow space. As for some letters with extreme words, I fully accept them because I have already been "meddlesome."</p>
<p>Please forgive everything, and I will not reply to each letter individually.</p>
<h3>The Death of a Little Life</h3>
<p>— Guo Lian</p>
<p>The refugee crisis has created a superficial prosperity in Shanghai. In the building where we have our shop, residential households account for 70-80%, so there are especially many children. From those held in arms upward, the number probably exceeds the total number of adults. The air is filled with the noisy sounds of children all day long, and there is practically no time to be quiet unless a black curtain descends from the sky.</p>
<p>Today is suddenly different! While the sun is still hanging high in the sky, for ten minutes, the noisy sounds of children disappeared.</p>
<p>Before these ten minutes arrived, it began with a fat woman directing her children to hide inside our shop, and she did not allow any of them to stand in a place where they could see anything outside the door; there were also no traces of children in the courtyard or the living room.</p>
<p>Because my ears are accustomed to noisy sounds, at this time, I felt the air especially deadly and terrifying.</p>
<p>Later, I found out that because the house is small and there are many people, and the weather has become hot in the past two days, the air is especially stifling. Under these circumstances, on the upper floor, a child in the Ningbo wife's home was sacrificed. A small child - was taken out in a cattail bag. The time when this building was suddenly different was precisely when this small shell, now separated from its soul, was put into a cattail bag, ready to be carried downstairs. The reason why the children hid: it is said that if children see a dead child, they will have "misfortune" themselves in the future. Although there was still a cattail bag outside, their parents seriously hid them to prevent them from seeing it and having future "misfortune." Therefore, this ten minutes of dead silence was created.</p>
<p>But why did this "misfortune" especially befall this dead child? Was it because his parents neglected him before he was alive and let him see another dead child? But I can say: Oh! A hundred ohs...! Because from the day this little life came into the world, I remember that I only tore off forty-one pages from the calendar hanging on the wall, yet he - this little life ended!</p>
<p>He hadn't even reached the gate yet, so where would a dead child have made him meet and cause today's "misfortune"?</p>
<p>This life's misfortune should entirely be attributed to: the narrowness of the house; the stifling air; and especially the parents' negligence! Because the first two can still be attributed to economic limitations.</p>
<p>Parents of the new era, please stop being superstitious about forms! Children are the future masters of China. I hope you, as parents, will properly shoulder the responsibility of nurturing them!</p>
<h3>Why Use a "Pseudonym"?</h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>Reading "Spring and Autumn" a few days ago, I learned that a certain "grain of Zhang Yisheng" wrote a letter to the editor of this publication, requesting him to publicly introduce him for a teaching position to help pay for tuition and miscellaneous fees at Yangzhou Middle School next semester. The editor was generous and made an exception; unexpectedly, two days later, an editor's reply said that a Shen Lu called Yangzhou Middle School and said that there was no such person as "Zhang Yisheng" at the school. This made countless readers feel disappointed. It wasn't until June 3 that Zhang wrote a letter saying that "Yisheng" was actually a pseudonym, so "the school authorities could not notify the student."</p>
<p>The matter ended like this, but we want to respectfully ask this "Zhang Yisheng" why did you use a pseudonym? Is it because you were afraid of people knowing that you didn't have tuition? Is it because not having tuition is considered a shameful thing?</p>
<p>I think Zhang's spirit of wanting to work to continue his studies because he has no tuition should be praised by every rational person and is definitely not a shameful thing.</p>
<p>On the contrary, everyone who has the same ambition as Zhang should stand up and imitate (but that doesn't mean everyone should use "Spring and Autumn" as a job introduction agency, because in fact, "Spring and Autumn" doesn't have that much space, and the occupation itself has its own separate methods), break the concept of vanity, and create a way out for themselves!</p>
<h3>"Leaving Quota" Has Gifts</h3>
<p>— San San</p>
<p>Before every holiday, in order to count the number of students for the next semester, each school has the practice of paying a "leaving quota fee." Now is naturally the time again. A certain school is even holding a "grand giveaway" to encourage students to "leave their quota" early. The methods are as follows:</p>
<p>Middle school students, 7 yuan per person; elementary school students, 4 yuan per person. Those who pay first will receive drawing paper worth 2 jiao (all stamped with the school seal; ordinary notebooks are also like this, all must be purchased from the school store to show neatness and uniformity); elementary school students who pay first will receive a "voucher" worth 1 jiao from the school store, it is said.</p>
<p>Hawthorne's Detective Cases</p>
<h3>The Homecoming of the Dancing Queen</h3>
<p>— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter One: "A very pretty young lady!"</p>
<p>"Anna? Bao Lang, I'm a little confused. Is there a compound surname Anna in the 'Hundred Family Surnames'?"</p>
<p>I replied coldly, "That's not a surname. That's the transliteration of the foreign woman's given name, Anna."</p>
<p>Hawthorne also pretended to suddenly understand and nodded. "Oh, I see. So, I really shouldn't use 'girl' or 'Miss,' I should call her Miss. Right?"</p>
<p>A small patch of white seemed to show in Anna's eyes, but she didn't answer.</p>
<p>Hawthorne said again, "Miss Anna - sigh - sorry, I shouldn't call you that, but there's no other way - may I ask Miss your surname?"</p>
<p>She said unhappily, "Jiang!"</p>
<p>"Oh dear, please forgive my rudeness, but this surname doesn't seem very fitting. This surname Jiang is a Chinese surname that we have in the Hundred Family Surnames!"</p>
<p>Anna became a little uneasy. Not only did white show in her eyes, but the black parts also showed a light of almost annoyance.</p>
<p>"I'm not here to ask you to criticize my surname and name. I'm here to ask you to handle a case." She casually threw most of her cigarette into the ashtray.</p>
<p>Hawthorne looked at her hair and said smoothly, "This hair is dyed perfectly, it really looks like a foreigner's blonde color. If there was a way to dye black eyes petroleum blue, Miss Jiang, I would advise you that it's worth trying!"</p>
<p>Auntie Su walked in to clear the dishes, interrupting Hawthorne's sarcastic words. But Anna wasn't embarrassed, she only showed that kind of resentful look.</p>
<p>"Mr. Hawthorne, I'm here to ask you about a murder case. Why are you making fun of me?"</p>
<p>Her tone had clearly changed, and the "fire" in her expression had also subsided a lot. Hawthorne also nodded.</p>
<p>He said, "I'm very sorry, how dare I joke? This is my contribution... sigh, you say it's a murder case? Who died?" (5)</p>

<h3>Chaplin's Family Life</h3>
<p>— Xin Liang</p>
<p>Chaplin doesn't really like to receive visitors except on Sunday afternoons, because he's really too busy. One Sunday, we went to visit him at his house, his wife, Paulette Goddard, and his two sons.</p>
<p>We arrived at his house at noon. Chaplin had worked too much last night, so he had just gotten up. We all met in the living room.</p>
<p>The walls of the living room were full of the latest popular books, most of which were signed and given to him by the original authors.</p>
<p>As we all walked hand in hand up to his house (built on a steep mountain), he told us how much he loved flowers - their beauty often moved him. "Their easy fading makes me very sad," he said with a smile.</p>
<p>When we walked back down, Paulette had already dressed up. She was playing with a curly-haired dog, and when she saw us, she immediately rushed forward to greet us. I've heard people use the words "phosphorescent" to describe her, and indeed, it couldn't be more fitting. She has a kind of vitality, she doesn't need makeup, she has a tanned skin that can attract you.</p>
<p>Her eyes are also very bright. The eye sockets aren't very big, but they're constantly moving, jumping around, as if they're talking to you.</p>
<p>On Sundays, they usually have lunch under the shade of several big trees next to the swimming pool. On Sundays, Chaplin's two sons, one named Little Chaplin, thirteen years old, and one named Sidney, twelve years old, also come home from military school. Their physiques are also very strong, and they're both full of energy; their actions, although seemingly rough, are very lovable. At meal times, they seem very shy, and they don't say a word to strangers. These two children love Paulette very much, and Paulette, in turn, also likes them. She often goes to their school to visit, watch various ball games, and sometimes, she's the one who gives out the prizes.</p>
<p>Paulette's greatest pleasure is knitting yarn. Whenever she has free time, she'll sit down and knit. "Oh, this is my hobby," she told us: "The wool sweaters and undershirts that I wear myself are all knitted by me. In the photography studio, when the workers are arranging the scenery, etc., I take out my knitting needles and knit clothes. Do you want me to knit you a sweater? I can give you one next Christmas."</p>
<p>After dinner, we all went back to the library. Sometimes, if we're lucky, we'll hear Chaplin play the piano himself. From this, we can know that Chaplin is not only a theatrical genius, but also a musical master. When he feels "bored," he also likes to read aloud a few lines of brilliant text from books.</p>
<h3>The European War on the Silver Screen</h3>
<p>— Xin Fang</p>
<p>The outbreak of the European War has caused Hollywood film companies to significantly change their filming policies. On the one hand, to adjust the mood of people around the world, comedies are indispensable; on the other hand, to cater to the tide of anger of the times, war films are certainly needed to be produced in large quantities.</p>
<p>Paramount is currently considering filming a blockbuster, titled "Mystery Ship," preparing to put the historical facts of the naval battle in the North Sea and the sinking of the German pocket battleship Admiral Graf Spee in the territorial waters near Uruguay after the battle with the three British cruisers on the silver screen, introducing them to the audience.</p>
<p>The authorities at Universal also have a story about European countries that has been compiled, the content of which describes the before and after of the recent war in Finland; this story has been named "Sea Patrol." Soon, personnel will be assigned to various departments.</p>
<p>MGM also has two films that are currently under construction, one titled "Escape" and the other "MortolStorm." The content is entirely a description of the situation of the Nazi Party in Germany and the detailed information on the back of the current European War.</p>
<p>In addition to what I want to report here, there is another major development in Hollywood recently; they are preparing to make their productions able to take on the responsibility of reporting to people all over the world every day, following the daily newspapers. According to this situation, there will eventually be a day when the news industry is led by the film industry.</p>
<h3>The First Performance of the Youth Society</h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>Youth is active. Studying on an isolated island is suffocating. Extracurricular activities should be combined with studying. The performance of the Youth Drama Research Society is to increase the interest of youth in extracurricular activities. Their first performance, which was also the day of their establishment, was at the YMCA on Sichuan Road. The names of the plays performed were modern and aimed at the current society; the first was "Uncle Liu San," which described an old gentleman in the countryside who, for the sake of his son, was lured by profit and sold out a friend. As a result, the father sacrificed a dirty son to maintain their family's history of integrity. The second play was "Lesson." A woman who left her hometown and taught a group of lovely elementary school students quietly went to the rear of the motherland, breaking away from stubborn family beliefs and inferior environments. In her last hasty words, there were these two lines: "I have donated my thousand-dollar dowry to the country, to avoid consuming shame..." These two profound sentences are not only a stimulus to the characters in the play, but also a warning to those who are currently in a dangerous situation. The heroine's fluent dialogue added a lot of vitality to the whole play.</p>
<p>The third play was the longest and most touching. The name of the play was "The Persecuted." A strong man who would rather starve than work for bad people, a girl struggling in a circle of lust, an old man sick in bed, a woman tempted by profit - combined to form a tragedy. In the end, the old man couldn't bear to see them! A pair of lovers under the evil forces committed a crime due to hunger. The girl was weak-willed and couldn't fight to the end, so she committed suicide. The strong man, waiting to kill the evil people and go to the light with his lover, could only bear a great hope in vain and hurriedly went to the interior alone. "The Persecuted" ended like this, and the three one-act plays also closed.</p>
<p>Although their sets and lighting were not grand enough, their performance can be said to be a success. It was not excessive, just right, and really encouraged young people to have a good impression of spoken drama.</p>
<p>Finally: I myself am also a depressed youth. I use the feelings and interests of a youth to introduce it to youths who regret having no extracurricular activities; I probably won't disappoint them! (Moved to help those in need)</p>
<h3>A History of Chinese Opera</h3>
<p>— Hai Xing</p>
<p>There is hope for the publication this year of "A History of Chinese Opera" written by Zhou Yibai, with more than 600,000 words. It has critical descriptions from the Yuan Dynasty to the present and can be called an unprecedented masterpiece in the Chinese drama scene. A major bookstore had requested its publication before the war. After the "August 13th" incident, the bookstore gave up because of the sharp increase in costs and the obstruction of transportation in various places, making sales uncertain. In recent years, Zhou has revised it several times and added a lot of new information. It is now heard that it will be published by the Commercial Press under the recommendation of Zhou Yueran, and will be released in three installments. The first installment may be released this year.</p>
<h3>A Formal Announcement to Broadcasting Stations</h3>
<p>— Rui</p>
<p>Radio broadcasting stations have a considerable history and status in Shanghai. Before the war, there were more than 20 broadcasting stations in Shanghai. However, at that time, because they were under the strict supervision and control of the Ministry of Communications, each broadcasting station paid very close attention to its own frequency, and broadcasting stations with less sophisticated equipment were not allowed to operate by the Ministry of Communications.</p>
<p>However, since the outbreak of the war, the government has moved from Nanjing to Chongqing, and Shanghai has therefore become a special place. Due to the increase in population and the abnormal development of various industries, broadcasting stations have sprung up like mushrooms after rain. However, because the environment is special and not subject to the control of the Ministry of Communications, they don't pay much attention to the frequency of the broadcasting stations. The neighboring broadcasting stations often interfere with each other, and even the better radios cannot separate them clearly. Even if there are good broadcasting programs, the audience feels disgusted. In this way, broadcasting stations that aim to make a profit will reduce their broadcasting effectiveness due to the reduction in the audience.</p>
<p>Secondly, what the audience regrets is that the announcers report advertisements incessantly or repeatedly. Although the broadcasting station aims to make a profit, advertising is of course the main business. However, if the record is only played for three minutes, and the announcer's commercial advertisement continues for five minutes or even ten minutes, this not only fails to increase the effectiveness of the advertisement, but instead makes the audience feel disgusted and unwilling to continue listening, causing the effectiveness of the advertisement to be reduced accordingly. Therefore, the reporting of advertisements must be concise and the amount must not be excessive. It is hoped that the broadcasting stations will pay attention.</p>
<p>Brief News: (1) The China Drama Society's "Han Gaozu" has been announced for a long time, but the author, Fei Tai, has revised the original manuscript several times out of seriousness, and has only now completed all five acts. At the same time, director Fei Mu has just finished filming "Confucius." After the editing is completed, he will immediately begin work on "Han Gaozu," so the rumor that Fei Mu will direct "Wen Tianxiang" is completely inaccurate. (2) Rong Shutang and Xu Zhentai, members of the Friendship National Opera Troupe in this city, have received careful guidance from the famous teacher Zhu Dingyuan, and their skills have improved rapidly. The troupe will hold its first rehearsal of the year at the Ningbo Fellow Association on the 9th of this month. Rong and Xu will also star in "Zhujia Village," and group leader Xu Tongsun will play in the Imperial Orchard. This performance will be very satisfactory. (3) Zhou Zenzuo, a wealthy paint merchant in Shanghai, held an engagement ceremony with Miss Qiu Zhijie at the Grand Ballroom of the Xianle Dance Palace on Jing'an Temple Road yesterday. The famous band Luo Ping led the entire orchestra to accompany the ceremony, which was extremely grand. The Xianle has a beautiful layout and low fees, and is equipped with hot and cold air conditioning. All sectors can rent it.</p>
