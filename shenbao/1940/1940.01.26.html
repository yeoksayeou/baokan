<h3 id="c15">廢止美日商約聲上的英日關係 <a href="#c15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>美日現行商的，即將於今日起廢棄無效，以後兩國關係怎樣調整，已爲世界各國關心遠東局勢者所注意。以美國對遠東經濟控制力的强大，倘能有所舉動，常確能左右遠東的大局而無疑；至於究竟作何舉動，大的不久漸見分明，容待他日就事探討。至於目前，我們深覺不能忽視了英日關係。英幽在華的經濟權益，在遠東的殖民地，都和英帝國有極密切的關係；所以她的遠東政策，也很足以影響到中日戰爭的整個局勢；尤其是在美日商的實行廢棄的前後，日本在外交上利用聲東擊西聯甲制乙的時候，英日兩國關係的動向，更具有極深長的意義。</p>
<p>自第二次歐戰發生之後，英國對於遠東，據官方屢决所聲明，乃是繼續其過去的一貫政策，始終維持中日兩國間的和好友誼；但在事實上，英國已有不少的小動作，使日本方面認爲英國最易對；而在第三者看來，英國却也顯有對日逐漸讓步的傾向。其中最顯著的例，如去年日輪山陽丸滿載德貨，安然通過英國封鎖綫而返歸本國；嗣後更無其他日輪遭受英力檢查的消息。無疑的，這是英國爲着對日表示柔和，遂不恤犧牲他自己一部分的經濟武器。又如英國以歐戰爲藉口而逐漸撤退華北駐軍，這又和日本對英提出撤退在華軍隊的要求恰相呼應。又如前不久所傳天津存銀，即將如何解決，這固然不利於中國，却也是英國希圖結歡於日本的又一證。英國這樣一再委屈求全，不能不說是犧牲重大，其趨向也正和歐戰未爆發前，他的歐洲綏靖政策一樣。</p>
<p>在幾天以前，國際間曾傳出過一個荒謬的謠言，謂英日已經訂有密約，此事業經各有關方面正式否認；而製造這種謠言的，却正幻想恢復過去的英日同盟，欲藉英日同盟而獲得巨大的收穫，這又是無可諱的事實。可是不旋踵間，華北的反英運動又復重起；而日本國內，更以英國在日本海外公海上搜查日輪「淺間丸」，捕去德人二十一名事爲藉口，發動反英高潮。據日方宣稱，英國此舉是否合乎國際法還是問題；至於在日本海外捕獲德人。則實有損於日本威望，爲對日的不友好行動。英國究竟可吾在日本海外公海上捕獲敵人，這自有國際法典可依，日本儘可據以抗議；不過無論是法律，是威望，是友誼，都是應該雙方遵守，而絕不是單方面的義務。所謂「己所不欲勿施於人」的原則，日本根本上就不遵守；她在這决侵華戰爭中，任意破壞第三國在華財產，妨碍第三國對華的貿易和航業，侮辱第三國在華的僑民和官吏，這種事件的不斷發生，已成司空見慣，毫小足奇。如美艦潘南號的無故被炸，英大使的被飛機攻擊，英武官的被拘囚，英帝航機的被擊落，英美法各國在內地的教會被燬滅，這都是國際間很少看到的暴行；便單就日本對英國的遠東航業來說，經過中國沿海和香港近海的英船，亦是屢决受日本軍艦的檢查。他如扣留英船上的貨物，拘捕英船上的華人，這更是事實孔多。日本既未向中國宣戰，她有什麼權力可以干涉英船在中國沿海和香港海外公海上的航行？爲什麼她自己又不顧全英國的友誼和威望？</p>
<p>日本以淺間丸事件而重新激動反英高潮，這和法律友好及威望的關係都很少；而和他目前整個外交活動的關係却大。日本强謂英國此舉的用意，係在響應美國的廢止美日商的，表示英美會聯合對日加以壓迫。其實日本這决故意渲染，其眞正用意，恐怕第一還是想藉此以試探英國的態度，看他對遠東問題現在是否眞的還能和美國密切合作，以便決定其如何對美談判；其决便是想要迫使英國再作讓步，以便什遠東更得爲所欲爲。</p>
<p>英國在日本這樣裝腔作勢的壓迫情形下面，以後對於英日問題，是否眞的要走上英美合作的道路夾對付日本呢？還是運用過去延挨和遷就的手段來敷衍了事？目前確又是一個新的轉機；我們以爲在日本所謂，「東亞新秩序」下，無論英國如何犧牲，總絕難保持其所有在華權益。前兩天各報所揭佈的「妥協文件」。日昨蔣委員長所發表的告友邦人士書，都已將這種趨勢完全暴露；而一週以前，天津日軍司令本間發表談話，謂「日本的目標，即在摧毀華北英人的宰制，」這更足以促使英國猛醒。英國現在歐洲作、戰，昌言阻止侵略，維持正義，對遠東又豈能長此伈伈睍睍，步步退讓？英國如果善用時機的話，在這美日商的廢止聲中，爲着保護自己權益，爲着挽回自己威望，爲着維持人類正義，也就應該有着桴鼓相應的嚴正舉動衣示。德有鄰，道不孤，英國不會失去目前一個最好的和美合作機會吧！</p>

<p>重慶　（續昨）我們同胞更可以知道、山近衛聲明東亞新秩序所推演出來的毒計、畢竞是怎樣的險惡、如果我們不堅決抗戰、不但中國國家和民族將皮骨無存、就是太平洋有關的各國、也將要陷於不能倖免的刦運、這可以讓世界各友邦知道他們軍閥是怎樣的認識自己兵力不够、要涕泣嘆氣的假手傀儡來結束中日戰爭、而一方面又是如何的在妄以日本的國運爲孤注、來對世界作更大的冒險、我們全國抗戰有堅强無比的決心、可是我時刻懸念着我們淪陷區域內受盡僞組織壓迫、欺騙的同胞、我知道傀儡蠱惑欺騙的對象、是始終集中於我們海內外忠厚同胞、尤其是在淪陷區內同胞身上的、這一年以來、在兆銘發什麼「和平無望、我也跟着殉國、如果和平有望、而和平條件無害於中國之獨立自由、爲什麼不可講和平、」又說什麼、（日本所求、祗是經濟合作、）又說什麼、（日本以道義觀念代功利思想、不以戰勝者自居、且有同憂患之誠意、）又說什麼、（日本輿論主張尊重中國之主權與獨立、）又說什麼、（日本若要滅亡中國、則以全力繼續作戰便了、何必更爲託詞、）我們同胞中間、存心過於忠厚的、聽了他這些話、或不免多少爲其所麻醉、覺得其事可疑、而其言或非無因的樣子、現在他的本來面目、隨着文件一齊揭露出來了、我們同胞想一想、在兆銘翻來覆去所說的（老實話、）那一句不是絕對的謊話，他假作慈悲關心同胞痛苦的蜜語甘言、原來就是要騙我們同胞世世子孫、跌入萬丈深淵爲虎作倀的慣技、他一年以來、殫盡心力、和日本朝野開誠討論的（和平方案）、現在分明擱在國人的面前、就是這樣的一個方案、我們同胞道就可以明白、汪兆銘一年以來所殫盡心力的、無非是替人建造滅亡中國的路、替人搆築陷死中國國民的圈套、大家當還記得、他在去年七月九日對海外的廣播、他不是說（兩國交戰都是由停戰而議和、山講和而撤兵、交戰形勢依然存在、撤兵從何說起）拿這一套說法來勸誘來辯護嗎、他不是還到了廣州坐在日軍司令部裏、說要實現廣東的局部停戰嗎、同胞們想一想、自去年以來、我們前綫幾次血戰、愈打愈强、現在連汪兆銘機關報中華日報、也可以藉着前綫將士的犧牲、來說幾句騙人硬話、像所謂（日本希望和平、乃出發於不能擊敗中國）等等一類言語、日人所探懷而出迫令簽訂的、還是這樣一個（日支新關係調整要綱）、如果眞像在兆銘所說的先停戰後講和、那還有什麼和可講呢、一經停戰、還不是無條件的要中國乾脆投降就完事呢、還不是將這個（日支新關係調整要綱）、更加可以用猙獰的面目放肆無忌的擲了出來、一要你承認嗎、那還有什麼撤兵不撤兵可講呢、唯其我們全國一致沒有人上他的當、所以在兆銘祗好千辛萬苦的在偷偷摸摸中問、私訂這種契的、當他的主子不肯交付千萬元借款的時候、便從他的機關報裏發出（吾等又何必組織中央政府豈吾等亦將淪爲漢奸之流乎）一類的呼聲、這足以證明、祗要我們同胞意志堅定、汪兆銘的奸謀、是斷然沒有法子稱心遂願而成功的、日閥也沒有法子實現他這樣僥倖的毒計的、汪兆銘簽訂這個密的以後、他再打算如何做法呢、日人又將採取怎麼樣的手段呢、這都是我們全國同胞心中所必然引起的問題、但我以爲這些都不重要、不値得注意、只要我們安定一貫不變的國策、堅强抗戰、自然能够以最後勝利的光明消散這種鬼蜮的黑影、先說汪罷、汪在這個契的將近簽訂的時候、他躊躇滿志極了先是他的機關報（中華日報）說什麼（全面的和不能實現、除以局部的和蘄致於全面的和以外無辦法、）繼而汪自己在去年十二月廿九日又發表了一則通電後、說（目前所餘的問題、只是和平原則能吾實現、和平方案能吾完成的問題、）又說、（其體和平條件的能否獲得、有待於和平運動獲得之後、期其實現、亦有待於和平運動、）這一半是他還想掩飾其秘密簽字的事實、一半也是要仰望他主子的顏色、所以他今天以後必然還是致力於他的所謂（和平運動、）就是想（以局部的和蘄致全面的和、）他一定是想拉攏醜類、糾成僞府、盜竊名義、作爲執行這個（日支新關係調整要綱）的主體、他或者還想、即使沒有第三國承認他的偽府、亦必然可以造起一些糾紛和麻煩來、使若干國家同他的僞政府發生事實上的往來、至於（局部的和、）他所謂（局部、）是怎麼說呢、這就是說、日軍所佔領的南京城、就是他所能作主出賣的（局部、）再以這個（局部）作基礎、假借他主子的力量、和我們全國抗戰軍民作對敵、來殘害我們全國不願作亡國奴的每一個同胞、而妄想由此達到（全面的和、）就是出賣整個的國家、以償他主人的大欲、他的打算、就是如此、他說已不能冉有顧慮了、但我要問我們同胞、我們難道對於這種還沒什麼顧慮嗎、我們不注意他這種偽組織、更不屑注意他將怎麼樣（蘄致於全面的和、）我們只認定仟憑僭竊着什麼名義、終不過是日本的一個奴隸、奴隸是沒有獨立的人格的、我們現在一心抗戰、到消滅了他的主子軍閥爲止、他的主子消滅了、寄生體的奴隸、豈不也就完了、不過中國歷史上又多添一個秦檜劉豫張邦昌的後身、供後人痛憤而已、中國的民族意識、和夷夏大義、是每逢有漢奸國賊出現之時、更是砥礪發揚之會、我相信我們全國軍民、忠義激烈的奮鬥、必然隨着賣國行爲的具體化、而更見堅强、更見驍勇、更見普遍、至於日人以後怎麼樣、我們也大略可以推測、我猜想日人以後的行動、不外兩條路、一條路是一面捧出愧儡、一面（悉索敝賦）的、把他僅餘可調的兵力、調了出來、繼續加緊向我們進攻、以便他們軍部可以向議會要索軍費、同時可以搪塞他民間的不滿、第二條可能的路、或者是他自己覺得實力已竭、如冉調其他兵力、連到他國內都要發生變亂了、一等到傀儡出塲以後、他便借此名義宣吿他的（事變結束）、祗把軍隊放在佔領區內、旣不敢再向前進攻、亦不向後撤退、藉此安慰他國內反戰厭戰的情緒、以期山此稍紓喘息、而後扶植傀儡來以華制華、但是這兩條路、分明都是他的死路、先從第二條路來說、老實講、如果他想藉此結束、想藉此停息、決沒有這樣便宜的事、日軍一天不整個撤退、我們的戰鬥是一天也不中止的、他要退守、難道我們就不會反攻嗎、他想用全力鞏固佔領區、我們不會乘機收復失地嗎、再從第一條路來說、那就是把他在國內國外所僅餘可調的五個師團抽調出來、加緊進攻、這個在我們本是時時準備着的、而且必有十分把握的、全國同胞都知道、自從去年年底桂南粤北戰事至今、一個半月來、他屢决抽調增援、屢决喪兵折將、我們已測騐過他號稱最精銳的第五師團、和近衛師團的力量了、我今天可以明白的說、在三年以前敵人妄想我們中國在華北對他不戰而屈、到三年後的今天、我們就要使日本軍閥在華南戰塲上不戰而死、乃至不戰而敗、日軍現在軍紀的精神、都出乎我們意料之外、他現在所憑籍者、不過是他比較優勢的武器、但武器是要有戰鬬精神的部隊來使用的、現在國內經濟危機日深、外交徬徨無措、毫無出路、厭戰反戰的空氣、瀰漫全國、這種動盪不安的因素、當然反映到他前綫士氣、我在去年五中全會時、已經透切論述日人必敗之道、說他已陷入於桂形和死地、處處都處於欲進不得欲退不能的地位、自從他侵佔南寗之後、無論天時地利與人和上、他更是陷於絕境了、他的最後失敗的時期、必不在遠了、我們祗待他最後覆滅的時期到來、加以一舉的殲滅、現在姑不論我們隨時隨地都給日軍以積極的不斷的打擊、即使我們和他作消極的防禦戰、我們亦必可使他不戰而死、促起他最後的失敗　我們祗看山西戰塲、他始終保持六個師團以上的兵力、一度度的補充、不知道補充多少回了、到如今已經打了兩年之久、而我們山西依然如故、現在拿山西來和兩廣的地形和氣候相對比、莫說兩廣地形嶂巒重疊、交通困難、而且瘴癘迷漫、疾疫盛行、日軍以島國人民的生活習慣、以平原地區作戰的訓練、而進人到這樣地帶、豈非不戰死也要病死麼、我還可以說、日軍進入這一地帶、就是不病死也要困死、就是我們不用兵力去圍困他、而那裏特殊的天然地形和氣候、這點自然力量、就可以制日軍的死命、使他全數困憊而死、他開來的軍隊愈多、我們殲滅他的機會愈大、而最後勝利也愈快、所以日人進犯兩廣、本來是自尋死路、他前年僅佔廣州、或者還沒有嘗足這種病死的苦味、更沒有想到困死的一着、所以去年年底敢來進攻南寗際这就是他最後的冒险、我们就要在这个地带、逼得他大部增援、實現使他不戰而死的原則、以造成我們的最後勝利、至於其他戰塲上、我們一方面不斷的與以消耗、一方面積極的與以打擊、要使他應合了我們的有利的戰術、來自尋覆滅、總之、在軍事上我早經屢次聲明、自信有十分勝利的把握、何况這一次日汪協定的披露、更加深我們前綫將士的憤恨、不當對全國官兵下一道激勵軍心最有力量的檄文、我們全國同胞和將士、現在必然知道不奮門就是滅亡、不血戰就是要束手待斃、就要被出賣做奴歀、我們如何能受此汙辱、我們如何能不求取我們國家的生存、爭回我們國家的人格叱、現在日內閣一換再換、少壯軍閥的孤注一擲、不但要牽累日本六千萬人民自尋死滅更要攪亂東亞、引起全世界人類莫大的禍患、這是東亞禍福世界安危最要關頭的一瞬、我們抗戰的意義、就在不惜一切犧牲、爲國家民族獨立生存作護衛、爲國際公約東亞幸福作干盾、我們的責任、實在是萬分重大、我們現在正是踏上最後勝利前所必經的最艱鉅的階段、深願我全國同胞、全軍將士、乘此時機、加倍黽勉努力奮鬥、光復山河、完成國民革命實現三民主義的莊嚴使命、（二十四電）</p>

<p>倫敦　倫敦羅國官塲通信社頃發表一文說叫羅國實施新計割、對於油礦之出產與提煉加以統制、與調整事、謂羅國油礦之改組、純出於內部之需要不應發生國外惶慮之理由云、此文之發表蓋欲袪除協的國所具今後德國將因此而進有羅國大批油供給之疑慮也、聞羅國立塲以爲新油部之設立與供應部之設立同一旨趣、原意在應合羅國國防之需要、據該文告稱、油與其副產品、佔羅國全部輸出百分之六二、故有設立國內機關以期調整其出產與國內銷費與對外輸出之必要、乃於一月十五日通過設立油部之法律、授權該部管理油礦之發展、油之問題與新油之設立乃羅政府所擬振興與調整國內生產總綱之一部、目前並擬設立同樣機關以調整國內礦業與冶金業、此種計劃純以國內需要爲起點、不應發生國外惶慮之理山、（二十五日路透電）</p>
<p>倫敦　據此間消息靈通人士談稱、關於羅馬尼亞國與德國商務關係、英國政府現機向羅國政府提出詢問、以明眞相、尤其是關於羅國煤油供給德國問題、外間傳說紛紜、因此英法兩國業已開始交換意見、據聞羅國近頃會以大批煤油運往德國、但其數量、是否確較雙方商務協定所規定者為多、抑或羅國雖擬提高煤油供給數量、而尙未行、此際猶難斷言、惟以目下運輸困難情形觀之、似以第二種猾想、較爲正確、此在英國政界人士、均表不滿、並謂英國對於羅國滿足德國經濟需要之所爲、決小能長此容忍、但此間羅國人士談稱、邇來德國對於羅國行使壓力、日甚一日、英國未能向羅國提高購貨數量、俾羅國得以抵抗德國之壓迫斯免令人失望、（二十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>巴黎　關於德國在經濟上壓迫羅馬尼亞國事、法國一般人雖極注意、但焦念情形、初不若英國之甚、咸信園團國王加洛爾二世、決不致向德國宣告屈服、德國經濟　家克洛第斯、近雖迭决前往羅國京城、與羅國當局進行談話、企圖促使羅國將供給德國煤油之數量予以提高、羅國政府並已組織全國煤油委員會、統制全國煤油之生產與出口、而使英法兩國在該國境內之煤油公司、受其節制、但德羅兩國商務關係、仍有若干種困難爲之障礙、例如運輸困難運油車缺少、即其一端、惟在外交界人士則稱、德國軍隊業已開人蘇聯佔領區域伽里西亞省東部、用以保護德羅兩國間經山該省之鐵路交通、此舉顯爲對於羅國之一重大威脅、加之德國軍隊開入伽里西亞省東部之後、謠言甚熾、自足使羅國當局深感不安、顧按之實際、德國未必欲在巴爾幹半島立即採取軍事行動、其眞正用意、殆欲威脅巴爾幹半島各國、從而覓取最大限度之經濟助力、如此而已、（二十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>羅京　今日此間發表負責方面文吿、否認羅國新煤油統制辦法、含有便利德國之意、據稱因煤油產額下跌、對於油業已有加以調整之必要、羅國鑒於目前國際局勢之危險、其本身亦亟須秋蓄油類、（二十五日路透電）</p>

<p>在同興東面的隘道口下車、踏上在十天前還是決生死定主奴的戰塲、山坡上、碗口粗細的樹幹給彈片截斷了、在這之間、彈窟帶着焦黑的邊緣展佈着、剩下了死的寂寞、這一帶的高地、是崑崙關正面的日陣、曾由頑强的第五師團憑險堅守、擁護崑耑關、可是曾幾何時、它又重復回到祖國的懷抱、做了我們的崑耑關的强有力的後衛、山麓日軍的工事、宛然尚在、那是傍山挖掘的掩體、非常狡猾地躱在多方面的死角下、而它自己却可以相互構成綿密的交叉火網、中國的士兵、就在這種火網下利用手溜彈來衝鋒、有些掩體給炸塌了、有些却空着、那裏面的日本靑年逐步退上了山巓、而且卒不免就在那邊做了異國的戰鬼、—有一個土坑裏就葬着八十多個屍體、在公路左側的界首、是日軍最後放棄的所在、我們曾掘到一個六十餘屍的墓坑、日人在這兩個據點附近、曾配備它僅有的二門戰車防禦砲、防中國　車的衝擊、可是終於給中國甚少數的戰車三度突破、——而且照戰鬥原理上來講、這地帶原不是戰車可以發揮威力的所在、公路到了崑崙關北首、便向西作一個馬蹄形的灣曲、繞過崑崙關右側的高地、再同復到關南的下坡道到九塘去、我們却取古道向崑崙關北口去、一個衛士提着一挺輕機關槍引路、明代國子祭酒景陵魯鐸曾賦詩描寫這一段的景色道、「路上崑崙山、中林不見天、巢卑幽鳥護、樹老怪籐纏、空翠疑成滴、陰崖戒道邊、前趨知不遠、　築隔蒼烟、」然而詩人已往、境蹟猶存、幾百年來猶不失它巖險的形勢、仍爲兵家必爭的地帶、路邊的屍味、隨風撲來、使人不能不掩鼻而過、想起這些被驅來做侵略戰爭的犧牲者的父母妻女、還遠遠的在東海之東、每日朝拜默祝、眞有些不勝感慨、峯迴路轉、崑崙屹然相迎、藏在這巉巖高處的關隘、初見時並沒有雄奇的感覺、這是因爲用近代的眼光來看的緣故、大約古代的戰鬥第一在奪取關隘、以便大軍的行動、現代的却是爭奪高地、以控制某一要隘、從而佔領之、在這一次崑崙關的戰役中、雙方就都以全力爭奪崑崙關四過的各高地、它本身反不是砲火的焦點因此這古代的名關、並沒有受近代砲火的洗禮、依然保持着它盎然的古趣、我們在「崑崙關」關口攝影後、進入關內、夕陽已掛在遠處的山坳、從叢林密菁中斜射過來、使「威鎭南疆」四字的匾額、顯得特別淸楚、關門的亂石縫中、垂下一枝枝不知名的紅花、嬌艷地在微風中蕩漾、由左首石堦登關、有樓三楹、是道光二十六年邑　知縣柳際淸所重建的、已經很殘破、中祀狄武襄公（靑）</p>
<p>關於狄靑討儂智高事、正史稗官、都有詳細記載、道裏可引淸劉元淸「崑崙觀狄武襄戰處詩」來做一個複述、詩云、「粤之西兮有崑崙、嶙峋聳拔勢獨蹲、一山兩踞賓邕界、不减泰行與劍門、憶惜廣源州蠻寇、嶺南疆域盡蹂躪、問誰秉鉞專征者、武襄合兵孫合從、維時恰値上元節、飲府厭厭夜不輟、忽報二鼓破崑崙、神機不測稱神哲、迄今五百有餘年、人往蹟存勳可傳、登山眺望覓遺處、漠然徒見草芊芊」、</p>
<p>關內有屋數十棟、原已很破舊、再經日軍蹂躪、現在僅存四壁、向南下坡數十級、又有關門一道、和普通門戶沒有多大分別、但較堅固、出門、就聽到冷冷的水聲從坡道邊傳來、元代陳孚過崑崙詩云、「昨日過大林關、酸烟毒霧山復山、今日過崑崙關、寒泉怒　聲潺潺、道傍榕葉密如織、千柯萬葉巖崖間、……鐵鞭一揮出關去、孔雀飛下滄江灣、」上元謝少南崑崙關二十韻、中亦有云、「仄足崑崙上、巍然虎豹雄、峯凌萬石出、關闢兩紅、地高南逼　、山遠北連空、絕壁含槎古、飛岩拂草豐、………竣阪防旋馬、渟窪忽起虹、……瓴建無前　、梯懸失仰攻、……實在是至今未移的寫景詩、同時也可見得崑崙關南面形勢、（未完）</p>

<p>緬甸出席世界重整道德運動第二次大會代表馬寗泰女士，於返國途中，來滬小住，迭决應各界演講及參加軍整道德運動集會，均受熱烈歡迎。記者咋趨訪於博物院路旅决，女士身穿緬甸服裝，高髻，架銀色眼鏡，神采突然。當叩以重整迫德在緬甸推行情形，女士稱：緬甸爲　民族複雜之國家，宗敎派別，亦甚繁多。國內緬甸族與印度族或回敎與印度敎間，常因經濟利益，互相衝突。每年逢到國慶日，各族或各敎間，糾染羣衆，列隊遊行，每因情感衝動，發生毆鬥，各城鎭商號櫉窗，爲之燬壞，甚至電燈亦吿熄滅，仇隙殊深，以致到處充滿仇恨，嫉妬，自私之表現。自推行重整道德後，情勢爲　之一變。去年三月間，在仰光市政廳舉行重整道德運動大會，各族各敎領袖，均集會一堂，開誠相與，不僅往常意氣之爭爲　之消除，甚至相互道歉，表示携手台作，同負新責任。於是影響所及，不論在機關，團體，學校間，亦能相忍相諒，臻於和諧。因此，去年十二月國慶日，羣衆雖照常集隊遊行，秩序井然，巳無若前不幸事件之發生，於此可知推行重整道德運動，實造創人類眞實幸福。旋記者復叩詢重整道德運動的意義及推行方式，女士稱：重整道德運動四項生活準則，爲至誠，純潔，無私，博愛，誠能人人實行，則人與人間，家庭間，團體間，國家間，紛爭自息。吾人不應動輒指摘他人，應先審察自己，所言所行是否違反至誠，純潔，無私，博愛之準則；苟能深自審察，則必覺有許多不是處，須待改正。所以推行重整道德運動，重在個人身體力行，注意本位審察。聞女士離滬後將往中國內地兄明，重慶等處一遊，離滬日期，的在本月杪。</p>

<p>— 佛</p>
<p>斯時我兄弟共同辦事者的四五年。余因怔忡病發，歸家養疴。及辛亥革命，帝制推翻，而申報亦於是時，由席君經理而改由量才先生經理矣。民元，余擔任江穌省公報編輯。二次革命事起，離去。又入新聞報，年餘，因袁氏稱布，乃與吳君叔子，周君夢熊，同時辭職。後又至浦東中學，滬江大學敎書，的五六年，舊病復發，幾殆。據醫家云，若再吃敎員飯，必喪生命矣。余乃將滬江敎課辭去。其間余脫離申報者，的十年。至民九而重入巾報，在此十年之中，我兄弟聚首之時甚少，因各有職務，無法時時唔面也。</p>
<p>編輯生涯，實行飲食無節，起居無時八字，但日間最空最無聊之時間，即爲午後一二時至四五時。我兩人旣不喜賭博，又無其他嗜好，萬分無柳，故每日午後，我兄必偕周君夢熊及余，至仝羽春或一樂天啜茗二三小時。假定余有事他往，則兄如失羣之鳥，爲之不歡。兄每日下午五六時不辦公室，除吃晚膳外，必至次晨四五時，方始上樓就寢，在夏間則天已大明矣。我兄工作有恒，任事無怠，數十年如一日。我兄以報館爲家，而家事轉不大顧問。報紙舊例，一歲中惟寒假停刋七日，故我兄必至十二月二十八九日，方始歸家。元旦兄至弟處吃飯，或弟至兄處吃飯，有時作捉雀之戲，次日反之，此常例也。至初一日，又須赴　辦公，故在此四五日，得叙天倫之樂，此爲我兩人最快樂之時期矣。</p>
<p>民二十年春，余舊病又大發，乃入同孚路同德醫院開刀，住院中約二月，兄每日午後必至院中一次，無或間也。詢飲食，詢瘡口，備極周至。余以其年老，不必天天來，兄必曰，我本無事，故走走也。及余病痊，量才先生以余病後，不忍澈夜服務，乃調主本埠增刊。量才先生體諒鄙人，固無微不至矣。自是而後，我兩人服務時間不同，故相叙時間亦少。二十二年夏，陳冷先生因事辭職。二十三年秋，量才先生遇難於海寗之翁家埠，全館重務叢集家兄一身，而應付環境又十分困難。家兄黽勉從事，心力交悴，乃於二十四年春，中風之症作矣。住醫院中數月，回松養疴。間四五日余必往視一次，兄必詢問國事館事甚詳。及八一三事起，松地炸彈頻驚，松人避滬避鄉，見解各異。有人勸兄來滬者，兄曰我必以我弟之言決之。余聞之，乃僱車迎接來滬。在滬寓中，若遇風和日暖，必僱車至余寓談話。余間二三日亦必往視）次。假定數日不往，必詢其女曰：叔父來乎，何以此數日不見也？見余至，則　喜，閒談瑣碎事，因余不願與兄多談國事與館事，恐傷兄之心也。若見余離坐欲去，則必曰，天尙早，再談談，一若戀戀一刻不忍離去也者。吁！早知如此，我安忍離兄而去也。兄臨終又屬其家人曰，我死速電叔父，嗚呼，兄病危時，余因他事，不克前往，至死後而去，余之罪尙可言哉！</p>
<p>余與兄先後共事凡二十七八年。我兩人有時見解雖各不同，從未有半語齟齬，因此兩人感情，老而彌篤。吁！今尙欲與吾兄共同辦事，安可得耶？即欲復見吾兄之面與我兄談話，亦安可得耶？雖然，余亦老矣，追隨我兄於地下，亦恐無幾時矣！此時兄雖舍我而去，則我與兄相聚之期豈無日耶？　（完）</p>

<p>第二十回　世界交通同文共語　兒童敎育獎學憐才</p>
<p>西洋的婚禮中，常常開什麼跳舞會之類，依着蘇理雅太太的意思，最好也要熱鬧一下。但金澹雲說：『我們還是守着東方禮俗，何必事事要學四洋呢？雖然　班西賓，都喜歡跳舞，我們留學歐美的，也都能跳舞。但是那種交際舞，我們中國的中年人，未必都會，尤其中年太太們。因此若開跳舞會，就有不少人向隅。』許多中國朋友，要湊了公份，送堂會戲，都被金澹雲謝絕。至於雜要滑稽之類，倒可博來賓　笑，但在此刻又覺得有些低級趣味了。今天萬國大飯店的膳廳上，賓從如雲，士女雜　，一　也坐了三百餘人。新郞新娘，坐了正中主席，此外各有名片，依着了名片坐下。西餐是這裏最好的了，却也價錢不能太貴。酒是用葡萄酒，與中國固有的紹興黃酒。因爲中國近來各處種葡萄的地方很多，而葡萄製酒，也是中國　來釀酒家所著名的。中國的唐詩上，不是有什麽葡萄美酒夜光杯　之句嗎？中國並不是禁酒國，所以酒是可以盡量喝的。况且酒以合歡，　說吃喜酒，當然主人不能惜酒。但是中國如　還是守着古人所說的「惟酒無量不及亂」的意思，各地力的衛生機關，不許儘管賣酒給醉人喝，對於各賣酒的店肆都有一個禁咧。我今且說這蘇州來吃喜酒的六位小姐，她們本來也坐在一處。吃到將要散席時，吳君　提議道：『我們不如到澹雲姊的家裏去游玩吧！你們高興去嗎？高興去，我六個人便一同去。』大家自然　高興去。朱愛人道：『不過他們新郞新娘都沒有回去，我們倒先闖了去。只怕她家裏沒有人，都在這裏吃喜酒，到她家裏，也沒有人招待。』邵慧華道：『那是不會沒有人招待的，停　刻兒工夫，他們就要回去了。就是沒有人招待，我們幾個人，可以互相招待。停刻兒，他們回來時，只怕還有許多黃頭髪綠眼睛的人，要跟了他們來咧。我們先去佔據了她的新房，我們去吃她的喜果糖食，我們可以捷足先得。」這六位小姐中，要算朱愛人年紀最長，吳君可年紀最小，而最鬧的，便是吳君素與邵慧華兩人了。　（二三二）</p>

<p>— 新影</p>
<p>卡通片鼻祖米老鼠發明人華脫狄斯耐Walt　Disney，照例經過了一個年頭之後，在歲尾年頭的時節，要決定未來一年中的製片計劃。而現在他對於一九四〇年度的製片計劃，又全部決定了，在他的工作計劃中，特別可舉出的，就是唐老鴨本年度將大出風頭，而繼「白雪公主」之後，第二部長篇作品亦將攝製完成，和影迷相見了。</p>
<p>唐老鴨Donald　Duck在銀幕上的出現，要比米老鼠Mickey　Mouse遲過幾年。狄斯耐在一九三二年方有創造</p>
<p>唐老鴨計劃而實際上唐老鴉在一九三四年才登上銀幕。牠的聞名也遠沒有米老鼠之甚。但現在的唐老鴨却不然，在銀幕上面，也很受人歡迎。每天所接到影迷的來信，有時和米老鼠相等，有時竟超過米老鼠。唐老鴨自一九三四年在「聰明的小鷄」一片中演出之後，接着在「孤兒的福利」，「孤兒的野宴」等畫片中，都有牠的戲，而且常和米老鼠台作。自一九三七年起，牠已能獨樹一幟，爲一般電影觀衆所歡迎。而且根據華脫狄斯耐的製片表上一九三九—四〇年度，將成唐老鴨的世界，排在春季中製作的上八部短片之中，由唐老鴨主演者將有十二部之多，所以米老鼠相形見絀，好比被唐老鴨吃癟的樣子。</p>
<p>迭斯耐的第一部長篇畫片「白雪公主」，公映結果，獲得莫大的成功。現在他第二部長篇作品</p>
<p>木偶奇遇記Pinocchio又快要攝製完成，不久將在美國公映，大致本年內決可和上海影迷相見。這部畫片的故事，正和「白雪公主」相同，和我們並不生疏。雖然全部工作，目前沒有完竣，但狄斯耐遠在兩年之前，就在規劃把「木偶奇遇記」搬上銀慕，並曾迭次和幹部職員會議，決定用何種方式使「木偶奇遇記」在銀幕上演出。他對於這部畫片的審愼處理，即此已可見一斑。經過了兩年的工作，還沒全部攝成。他日問世之後，將和「白雪公主」先後媲美，乃爲必然之事。我們且期待着公映之後，以事實來證明預測吧。</p>

<p>勞萊哈台合演之「壽頭丘八」之後，多年的老搭擋曾一度拆散，哈台也獨當一面主演了一部「大地良心」。按勞萊哈台的受人歡迎，不外是一副傻頭傻腦的動作使人發笑而已，其他都是胡鬧。所以，他們的「護花天使」，居於次要的地位來襯托另外一個故事，是獲得了意外的成功。但是不幸他們拆擋了。哈台果然是個喜劇演員，然在「天地良心」中因劇本的限制，未見特色。現在重復合作的第一部作品「色星高照」又和以前的作品一樣，以兩人爲主體，而以胡鬧滑稽來完成一個故事的。</p>
<p>故事是叙述哈台失意後，頓萌自殺之念，因一軍官之勸勉，赴菲洲投軍；但又不慣軍隊生活之苦，擬整裝歸國，於是鬧出了許多笑話。最後哈台墮機喪生，投胎爲馬，更是想入非非，引人笑痛了肚皮。</p>

<p>鳳凰加入國華公司時「李三娘」正須要着這個角色，於是造成她的一鳴驚人，接着又演「新地獄」我覺得　很會演戲。她今年十二歲上海人。</p>
<p>我第一次見她，她正偎倚着她的母親，烏黑的眸子直對我這陌生面孔，像要找尋出什麽寳貝似的。見面印象極好，因爲比銀幕上來得俊美。說話輕悄悄地，又是那樣彬彬有禮，可是不像大人。她一面拍戲，一面還在求學，這是很要緊的敎育問題。有些人往往做了「電影明星」，就丢了功課，我希望愛護童星者注意這一點。</p>

<p>Chongqing: According to a Chinese military spokesman today, the Japanese troops that occupied Xiaoshan on the 22nd have now been contained by the Chinese forces. The Japanese objective appears to be to attack Zhuji, located thirty-five miles south of Xiaoshan on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. The Japanese forces number approximately one division, and their aim is to divert Chinese forces from the offensive in the Taihu Lake region. Recently, Chinese guerrillas have been very active along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, destroying countless Japanese munitions depots. (25th Associated Press Dispatch)</p>

<p>Qingdao: The second day of the official Qingdao conference, which began at 10 AM today at the Guest House. Attendees today included Wang Jingwei, Chu Minyi, Zhou Fohai, Mei Siping, Lin Baisheng, Liu Yufen, Wang Kemin, Wang Yitang, Qi Xieyuan, Liang Hongzhi, Wen Zongyao, Chen Qun, Ren Yuandao, and other representatives. They first engaged in detailed discussions of the contents of the "Political Program" that had been decided on the 24th, and they were scheduled to present the organization of the "Central Political Council" for discussion within the day. (25th Domei News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Qingdao: The Qingdao conference, regarding the handling of the troops and government employees of the "Provisional" and "Reformed" governments after the establishment of the "New Central Government," has determined, as a result of discussions, that the administrative affairs of the "Provisional" and "Reformed" governments, as well as all current troops and government employees, will be inherited and that no changes will be made. The conference also considered economic and financial issues. (25th Domei News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Qingdao: In his opening address at the Qingdao conference today, Wang Jingwei stated that the Chinese "New Central Government" would adopt the system of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek's regime in order to avoid difficulties in obtaining recognition from various countries. "We now have only two paths to follow, one is to start from scratch and create a new constitution, which is close to a revolutionary nature. We can do this, but if we overthrow the current system, difficulties will inevitably arise, so we must adopt it and make slight revisions to remedy its weaknesses. As for where the capital will be located, it is too early to say now. The distribution of positions cannot be discussed yet." Wang also told Reuters that this meeting was only a preparation for the meeting of the Central Political Committee and that he, Wang Kemin, and Liang Hongzhi had gathered here for this purpose. The first meeting would most likely be held in Shanghai next month. "The government we are now organizing will follow the old system. We will strive to achieve internal peace throughout the country. Japan has declared that it will respect China's administrative integrity. We will solve all problems based on the principles established in the Konoe Declaration. Our pro-Japan peace policy will not harm the legitimate rights of other countries." Wang continued to discuss the peace terms published in Hong Kong, saying that this document was a draft plan proposed by some Japanese people in China on November 5 of last year and was not sufficient to represent the views of the Japanese government and that this document was not the original text and had additions and subtractions. Wang also said that he did not trust Gao Zongwu and Tao Xisheng after discovering their conspiracy to oppose him, but because the two were the earliest supporters, he had always been tolerant of them. As for the new government's policy towards Chongqing, it will be based on his telegram to Chiang on January 16. If Chiang refuses to compromise, we will not have peace and must continue to move forward with the peace movement, which is difficult at present, but he believes that it can be achieved and that the foundation for peace has been completed. In the past few months, discussions between China and Japan have repeatedly achieved mutual understanding. Some people have asked why we do not publish the truth when others have published fictitious situations, but for the sake of the country, we cannot reveal this delicate negotiation, which is still in progress. Someone asked Wang Jingwei whether the current "Provisional Government" would be changed to the North China Political Affairs Committee and what status North China would have in the new regime after the "New Central Government" was established. Wang replied that he could not discuss the North China government under the name of a special status and that this was only to restore the old system. According to today's announcement, the Mongolian representatives participating in the meeting have left Qingdao because they will no longer participate in any future discussions. They have already conveyed their opinions to the main representatives. (25th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>Chongqing: The Chongqing Garrison Headquarters, the Gendarmerie Headquarters, and the Police Department conducted house-by-house inspections of "residence permits" today, aiming to force all Chongqing residents without such permits to evacuate. The reason for taking this measure is that a large number of people have returned to Chongqing in the past few winter months, and there are concerns that overpopulation will result in significant civilian casualties during Japanese air raids, as happened during the air raid in May of last year. The general public believes that Japanese planes have not attacked Chongqing due to the bad weather. According to reports from Hunan and Zhejiang provinces, nine Japanese planes bombed the outskirts of Changsha yesterday afternoon, killing and wounding twenty people. Five bombs were also dropped on the outskirts of Jinhua yesterday, destroying thirty houses. (25th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e15">Anglo-Japanese Relations in the Wake of the Abolition of the US-Japan Commercial Treaty <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>The existing US-Japan commercial treaty will expire today, and the adjustment of relations between the two countries is being closely watched by those concerned about the situation in the Far East. Given the strength of the United States' economic control over the Far East, any action it takes will undoubtedly have a significant impact on the overall situation in the Far East. As for what action it will take, it will likely become clear soon, and we will discuss it further at a later date. For the time being, we feel that we cannot ignore Anglo-Japanese relations. Britain's economic rights and interests in China and its colonies in the Far East are closely linked to the British Empire, so its Far Eastern policy is also sufficient to affect the overall situation of the Sino-Japanese War. In particular, in the period before and after the US-Japan commercial treaty is abolished, when Japan is using diplomatic tactics of diversion and alliance, the direction of Anglo-Japanese relations is even more significant.</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Second European War, Britain's official declarations on the Far East have been to continue its consistent policy of maintaining friendship with both China and Japan. In practice, however, Britain has made a number of small moves that have led Japan to believe that Britain is the easiest to deal with. To third parties, however, Britain also appears to be gradually making concessions to Japan. The most prominent example is the fact that last year, the Japanese ship Sanyo Maru, fully loaded with German goods, safely passed through the British blockade line and returned to its own country. Since then, there has been no news of other Japanese ships being inspected by British forces. Undoubtedly, this was Britain's way of showing its gentleness to Japan, sacrificing part of its own economic weapons. Also, Britain's gradual withdrawal of its troops stationed in North China, citing the European war as an excuse, coincides with Japan's demand that it withdraw its troops from China. Also, the recent reports of how to resolve the Tianjin silver reserves, while unfavorable to China, are also another indication of Britain's attempt to please Japan. Britain's repeated concessions and compromises cannot be said to be a significant sacrifice, and the trend is similar to its European appeasement policy before the outbreak of the European war.</p>
<p>A few days ago, an absurd rumor circulated internationally that Britain and Japan had concluded a secret agreement. This has been formally denied by all parties concerned, but it is an undeniable fact that those who created this rumor were fantasizing about restoring the old Anglo-Japanese alliance and wanted to gain huge benefits from it. However, before long, the anti-British movement in North China resurfaced. Moreover, Japan, using the pretext of the British search of the Japanese ship "Asama Maru" on the high seas outside Japan and the capture of twenty-one Germans, launched an anti-British upsurge. According to Japanese claims, whether Britain's actions are in accordance with international law is still a question. As for capturing Germans outside Japan, it really damages Japan's prestige and is an unfriendly act towards Japan. Whether Britain can capture the enemy on the high seas outside Japan is a matter for international law to decide, and Japan can protest accordingly. However, law, prestige, and friendship should all be observed by both sides and are by no means unilateral obligations. Japan simply does not observe the principle of "do not do to others what you do not want done to yourself." In this war of aggression against China, it has arbitrarily destroyed the property of third countries in China, hindered the trade and shipping of third countries with China, and insulted the residents and officials of third countries in China. The continuous occurrence of such incidents has become commonplace and is not at all surprising. The unprovoked bombing of the American ship Panay, the attack on the British ambassador by aircraft, the detention of British military officers, and the downing of British Imperial Airways aircraft, and the destruction of churches of various countries including Britain, the United States, and France in the interior are all atrocities rarely seen in the international community. Simply in terms of Japan's treatment of Britain's Far Eastern shipping, British ships passing through the Chinese coast and the waters near Hong Kong are repeatedly subjected to inspections by Japanese warships. Furthermore, the detention of cargo on British ships and the arrest of Chinese people on British ships are even more numerous facts. Japan has not declared war on China, so what right does it have to interfere with British ships sailing on the Chinese coast and in international waters outside Hong Kong? Why does it not consider Britain's friendship and prestige?</p>
<p>Japan's re-stimulation of the anti-British upsurge with the Asama Maru incident has little to do with law, friendship, and prestige, but has a lot to do with its current overall diplomatic activities. Japan strongly claims that Britain's intention in this move is to respond to the United States' abolition of the US-Japan commercial treaty, indicating that Britain and the United States will jointly put pressure on Japan. In fact, Japan's deliberate exaggeration is probably intended, first of all, to test Britain's attitude and see if it can really cooperate closely with the United States on the Far Eastern issue, in order to decide how to negotiate with the United States. Secondly, it wants to force Britain to make further concessions so that it can do whatever it wants in the Far East.</p>
<p>Under Japan's high-handed pressure, will Britain really take the path of Anglo-American cooperation to deal with Japan on the Anglo-Japanese issue in the future? Or will it use the means of procrastination and appeasement in the past to muddle through? At present, there is indeed a new turning point. We believe that under Japan's so-called "New Order in East Asia," no matter how much Britain sacrifices, it will be difficult to maintain all of its rights and interests in China. The "Compromise Document" revealed in the newspapers two days ago and Generalissimo Chiang's declaration to friendly countries yesterday have fully exposed this trend. Moreover, a week ago, the commander of the Japanese army in Tianjin, Homma, made a statement saying that "Japan's goal is to destroy British dominance in North China," which is even more sufficient to prompt Britain to wake up. Britain is now fighting in Europe, advocating stopping aggression and maintaining justice. How can it continue to be so cautious and give way step by step in the Far East? If Britain makes good use of the opportunity, in the wake of the abolition of the US-Japan commercial treaty, in order to protect its own rights and interests, to restore its own prestige, and to maintain human justice, it should also show a solemn response with immediate action. A virtuous neighbor is not isolated. Britain will not lose the best opportunity to cooperate with the United States, will it?</p>

<p>Washington: With only one day remaining until the expiration of the 1911 US-Japan commercial treaty, several members of the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee announced yesterday that they would support the State Department's policy toward Japan, that is, the future US-Japan commercial relations will be determined by the evolution of the situation in the Far East. Democratic Senator King opposed immediately negotiating a new commercial treaty with Japan. King stated, "I strongly oppose Japan's disregard for treaties. I feel that now is the appropriate time to sever all relations with Japan." Democratic Senators Connally and Norris both stated that there is currently no reason to urgently sign a new commercial treaty with Japan to replace the treaty that expires tomorrow. In addition to Japan's infringement of US rights and interests in the Far East, the US government has denounced the Japanese military's occupation of Chinese territory as a direct violation of the guarantees proposed by Japan in the Nine-Power Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact. The US government has also denounced Japan's attempt to obtain international recognition of Japan's proposed "New Order in East Asia" as an attempt to obtain legal basis for Japan's past actions of violating treaty guarantees and international public law. The current attitude of the State Department seems to have decided not to sign treaties with Japan until Japan can respect other treaties in which both Japan and the United States participate (such as the Nine-Power Treaty, the Non-Aggression Pact, etc.). (25th Associated Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>London: As the 1911 US-Japan commercial treaty is about to expire, the various departments of the British government have divergent opinions on this matter. The British Foreign Office believes that Britain should not take the opportunity to expand its imperial exports to Japan, but other departments such as the Treasury and the Department of Economics advocate determining a certain policy to meet Britain's foreign exchange needs and other markets. Britain believes that the tension between the United States and Japan is likely to become more serious. According to general opinion, the tension between the United States and Japan has caused Britain to encounter unpleasant problems. The British Foreign Office believes that Britain must act cautiously in order to avoid interfering in the United States' semi-closed door policy toward Japan. However, some believe that this sentiment will not be widespread at a time when the country's need for markets and foreign exchange is increasing. It is generally expected that the government will be in a difficult position to refuse Japan's proposals, as Japan will turn to the British market. It is said that the British government will give special consideration to avoiding further tension in Anglo-Japanese relations. British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax recently told Japanese Ambassador to Britain Mamoru Shigemitsu that Germany is systematically recalling German technicians, mechanics, and other Germans of military value from the Far East. The British side believes that it has an obligation to prevent them from returning to Germany and to benefit the British government. (25th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo: The Asahi Shimbun published an article stating that the expiration of the 1911 US-Japan commercial treaty will not hinder commercial relations between Japan and the United States. The newspaper predicted that the bill proposed by US Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Pittman to impose a ban on the export of munitions and raw materials to Japan would soon be submitted for discussion in the US Congress. "Under the current circumstances, the Pittman Bill will pass Congress." The newspaper said that Japan's diplomatic policy has been largely declared, and that the United States has now become Britain's watchdog in the Far East, patrolling the world. The newspaper also believed that the Asama Maru incident occurred because Britain had foreseen that the United States would support Britain's actions. Therefore, the newspaper also said, "If Britain and the United States swallow the propaganda of economically trapping Japan and rashly provoke Japan without thinking, they will soon feel their mistake." (25th Associated Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo: The Japan Times' editorial today, "End of the US-Japan Commercial Treaty," stated that US-Japan relations will enter a state of instability in the future. It is reported that there are thousands of Japanese merchants in the United States who enjoy the rights under the commercial treaty. If they have to give up their businesses and return to the East, they will suffer great hardship. The total number of American merchants in Japan, Manchuria, and China is approximately equal to the number of Japanese merchants in the United States. Last June, foreign residents in Japan were required to register with the police, and the police issued a "prefectural permit" valid for one year. When the term expires, American or any other foreign residents must leave Japan unless they obtain a new permit. There is good reason to believe that this measure will be extended to Manchuria and extended to occupied areas of China through cooperative arrangements. (25th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Today, the local newspapers published editorials on the eve of the abolition of the US-Japan commercial treaty, urging all countries to take effective measures to stop Japan's aggression against China. An editorial in the Central Daily News, entitled "The Fundamental Problem of the Pacific," stated that the current world situation is entirely the result of Japan's aggression against China over the past decade, resulting in chaos in the Pacific. If the Japanese militarists continue to control the government, China must continue to resist with arms, and peace in the Pacific cannot be restored. "We hope that friendly countries will understand that the source of global unrest can be found in the Pacific, and that the fundamental problem of the Pacific lies in overthrowing the Japanese militarists and the Japanese army's withdrawal from China. We hope that all countries will provide China with effective assistance and ban the shipment of military supplies to Japan, so that the Japanese militarists will collapse. The fundamental problem of the Pacific can then be solved." (25th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>Washington — The Senate Foreign Relations Committee yesterday received a petition from 48,000 Philippine people requesting the U.S. government to impose an embargo on the export of military supplies and raw materials to Japan. Vice President Garner submitted three signature books from the petitioners to the Senate. The Senate then voted to refer the signature books to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for review.

<p>Tokyo — After Young, the Tokyo correspondent for the United Press International News Agency, was arrested by the Japanese police authorities, Mrs. Young was able to send daily necessities to the detention center and learned that her husband was being treated well, but she was still not allowed to meet him directly. The U.S. Embassy is maintaining close contact with the Japanese authorities. The details of the case are being kept strictly secret by the authorities. However, the "News of News" newspaper here has provided some details, claiming that Young was interrogated for "inciting behavior." Reportedly, after returning to Tokyo from Chongqing, China, he held a meeting with 50 people from the Japanese business community to exchange opinions. It is said that the discussion involved issues considered by the Japanese authorities to be military secrets. In addition, he published an article in the March issue of "Japan Review," describing his trip to Chongqing. One passage stated that the Japanese army seemed theoretically capable of breaking the Chinese army's resistance, but this might not be entirely true. This kind of opinion, even if expressed by a foreigner, is unacceptable to the Japanese authorities, and this is said to be one of the reasons for Young's arrest. In addition, the foreign affairs editors of "Yomiuri Shimbun" and "Hochi Shimbun," who were close to Young, had articles from Young sent to their newspapers for publication. As a result, those editors are also being questioned by the police authorities. (Havas, 24th)</p>

<p>London — British Prime Minister Chamberlain reiterated yesterday in the House of Commons that Britain guarantees to assist Belgium if it is unjustly invaded by Germany. A member of the House of Commons asked two questions, requesting the Prime Minister to answer them: (1) Does the statement by General Gort, Commander-in-Chief of the British Expeditionary Force in France, that if Belgium is attacked, Britain and France will quickly implement their guarantee as if by electricity, represent the opinion of the British government? (2) Has Britain prepared a military plan to implement the guarantee? Chamberlain replied that, according to the Treaty of Locarno, the British government guarantees to immediately assist Belgium in the event of an unjust German invasion of Belgium. This guarantee was reaffirmed to the King of Belgium last August by the British Ambassador to Belgium. However, the British government must maintain the right to determine what constitutes aggression. As for the question of how Britain's guarantees will be implemented, the government has already given it full attention. A Reuters diplomatic correspondent said that Belgian sources in London commented on the Prime Minister's statement, saying that the main factor in implementing this guarantee must be Belgium's request to invoke the guarantee. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<p>London — Regarding the issue of guaranteeing the security of Belgium, the statement made by Prime Minister Chamberlain in the House of Commons has recently been commented on by Belgian diplomatic circles here, stating that the implementation of the guarantee should be determined by the Belgian government's request for the guarantor countries to provide assistance, and whether to make that request is up to Belgium. This has never been denied by Britain and France. Observers say that the issue of Britain and France providing practical assistance to Belgium should be studied in two steps: first, if Belgium does not request assistance, Britain and France will not intervene; second, after Belgium requests assistance, Britain and France will consider the circumstances before deciding whether to intervene. In particular, the timing of Belgium's request should not be too late, so that Britain and France can quickly rush to the scene and not repeat the disaster of Charleroi (the British and French allied forces failed to fully assist Belgium in the late August 1914 incident, resulting in a defeat in the city of Charleroi in Belgium). In short, both the restrictions accepted by Britain, France, and Belgium should be flexible. The right to request assistance rests with Belgium, while the right to weigh the advantages and disadvantages and make a decision on whether to provide assistance rests with Britain and France. Politicians also advocate for advance arrangements to avoid Belgium requesting assistance only after German troops have invaded. The governments of Britain, France, and Belgium are closely studying this matter. (Havas, 24th)</p>

<p>London — German planes made the 13th attack since the start of the war on the Shetland Islands in northern Scotland yesterday. It is reported that the German planes dropped six bombs, four of which landed in sparsely populated areas with no military targets. The invading German planes, a total of three, flew back and forth over the islands for nearly two hours. Their main target seemed to be ships. One German plane dropped two bombs on a fishing boat on the east side of the island, but both missed. Another German plane dropped three bombs on a ship off the southeast coast, but also missed. British fighter planes attempted to engage, but did not encounter the German planes. According to witnesses, the German planes retreated into the clouds when the British planes approached. The Air Ministry announced that "an invading enemy plane attacked a cargo ship off the Shetland Islands and flew over the island to drop bombs. The bombs landed in the open field and there was no material damage." (Reuters, 25th)</p>

<p>Stockholm — According to reports from this city's newspaper correspondents in London, people in the British capital now generally believe that the Soviet-Finnish war will enter a critical stage in April. Therefore, the central government will quickly supply Finland with aircraft, anti-aircraft guns, artillery, etc. At the same time, the British government attaches great importance to the fact that the United States and other countries are sending volunteer soldiers to aid Finland. (Haitong News Agency, 25th)</p>
<p>Helsinki — Fierce fighting continues north of Lake Ladoga. The Soviet army is now planning to flank the Finnish forces. The Soviet commander seems to be trying to decide the outcome with this offensive. The fighting is now concentrated in the area around the only railway there, part of which is owned by the Soviet army and part of which is still in Finnish hands. Finnish soldiers there claim to have seen the image of a white-clad angel, facing the Soviet front line, extending its arms in a protective gesture. More than 600 Finnish soldiers have spoken of this apparition, both believers and non-believers. The areas where the Soviet army is now planning to attack are mostly forests and marshes. The entire area has only one major road, but if the Soviet army seizes this road, they can directly reach the center of Finland. Judging from the current situation, the Finnish army seems still able to hold its position to resist the repeatedly attacking Soviet army. A Finnish military communique recently stated that the fierce fighting in that area did not stop from morning to night yesterday. Yesterday, the Soviet army also launched an offensive between Summa and Muolaanjärvi, under the cover of artillery fire, but was driven back by the Finnish army. The Soviet army also attempted to advance across the ice in Muolaanjärvi, but also made no progress. Finnish artillery bombarded Soviet artillery positions and machine-gun nests with great effect. On the eastern front, the Soviet army launched attacks on several points, but all were repelled. It is reported that the Soviet side suffered considerable losses, and seven tanks were destroyed. In northern Finland, several Soviet planes bombed several places, and hospitals were again their target, with 21 civilian deaths and injuries, including several hospital staff. The Finnish military communique concluded by saying that the Finnish Air Force has repeatedly carried out reconnaissance and bombing flights, which have been quite successful. (Reuters, 25th)</p>

<p>Helsinki — The Soviet army is still continuing its largest offensive in recent weeks, desperately trying to cross the frozen swamps north of Lake Ladoga, with the aim of encircling Finland's main Mannerheim Line. The terrain the Soviet army is currently passing through is easier than the Karelian Isthmus, but they are still finding it difficult to advance and are suffering heavy losses. According to a Finnish military doctor who has just returned from the front, among the wounded Soviet soldiers he treated were two women, wearing lieutenant uniforms, who were wounded while serving in the forward troops. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<p>Helsinki — On the north side of Lake Ladoga, the Soviet army is launching a full-scale offensive in more than a dozen places simultaneously, with a fierce momentum, especially in the Kollaanjoki and Ägläjärvi areas. Both sides are still fighting fiercely. As for the Karelian Isthmus, the Red Army has once again regrouped and launched a fierce attack on the Mannerheim Line, but failed, leaving hundreds of bodies behind. (Havas, 25th)</p>

<p>Rome — The Italian newspaper "Il Popolo d'Italia," the mouthpiece of Prime Minister Mussolini, recently published an article stating that we do not pay attention to the speeches made by British and French authorities, because we already know very well what the goals of these countries are and what they will do after they win in the future. If these countries deem themselves to be "peacekeepers," we will certainly not be willing to be controlled by them. For this reason, our compatriots must not continue sleeping soundly. Fascist Italy loves peace, but must be prepared for war. The Catholic newspaper "Avvenire d'Italia" stated that Italy's various aspirations must be satisfied as soon as possible. If there is further delay, Italy's position on the current war in Europe will inevitably be affected. (Havas, 25th)</p>

<h3 id="e28">Chiang Kai-shek's Message to the People and Soldiers of the Nation <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing (Continued from Yesterday) Our compatriots can further understand the insidious nature of the East Asia New Order touted in Konoe's statement. If we do not resolutely resist Japan, not only will China as a nation and a people be utterly destroyed, but all countries concerned with the Pacific will also face inevitable calamity. This will allow friendly nations around the world to understand how their militarists recognize their own insufficient military strength and hypocritically seek to end the Sino-Japanese War through puppets, while also recklessly gambling Japan's national destiny on a greater risk to the world. Our nation has unwavering determination in its resistance, but I am constantly concerned about our compatriots in the occupied areas who are suffering from the oppression and deception of puppet organizations. I know that the targets of the puppets' deception are always our loyal compatriots at home and abroad, especially those in the occupied areas. Over the past year, Wang Jingwei has declared, "If there is no hope for peace, I will die for the country. If there is hope for peace, and the peace conditions do not harm China's independence and freedom, why can't we talk about peace?" He has also said things like, "What Japan seeks is only economic cooperation." And, "Japan replaces utilitarian thought with moral concepts, does not consider itself a victor, and has sincere intentions to share our hardships." And, "Japanese public opinion advocates respecting China's sovereignty and independence." And, "If Japan wants to destroy China, it can simply continue fighting with all its might; why bother with excuses?" Some of our compatriots, who are overly trusting, may have been somewhat deceived by these words, feeling that his actions are suspicious, but his words may not be without reason. Now, his true face is revealed along with the documents. Our compatriots, think about it, of all the "honest words" that Wang Jingwei has repeatedly said, which one is not an absolute lie? His honeyed words, feigning compassion and concern for the suffering of our compatriots, are actually the same old trick to deceive our compatriots, generation after generation, into falling into an abyss and working for the enemy. For the past year, he has exhausted his efforts to openly discuss a "peace plan" with the Japanese government and people. Now, this plan is clearly presented before the people of the nation. Our compatriots can understand that Wang Jingwei has spent the past year doing nothing but paving the way for the destruction of China and building a trap to kill the Chinese people. Everyone should remember that in his broadcast to overseas communities on July 9th last year, didn't he say, "All wars end with armistice and peace talks, and peace talks lead to troop withdrawal. The state of war still exists; how can we talk about troop withdrawal?" Didn't he use this kind of argument to persuade and defend his actions? Didn't he even go to Guangzhou and sit in the Japanese military headquarters, saying that he wanted to achieve a local armistice in Guangdong? Compatriots, think about it, since last year, our front lines have fought several bloody battles, becoming stronger with each fight. Now, even Wang Jingwei's mouthpiece, the China Daily, can use the sacrifices of the soldiers on the front lines to say a few hard-talking lies, such as the so-called "Japan hopes for peace because it cannot defeat China," and other such words. What the Japanese have forced upon us to sign, with ulterior motives, is still this "Outline for the Adjustment of the New Sino-Japanese Relationship." If it were really like Wang Jingwei said, that we should first have an armistice and then talk about peace, then what peace is there to talk about? Once there is an armistice, wouldn't it simply mean that China has to surrender unconditionally? Wouldn't it mean that this "Outline for the Adjustment of the New Sino-Japanese Relationship" can be thrown out even more brazenly and recklessly, demanding your acceptance? Then what troop withdrawal is there to talk about? It is precisely because our entire nation is united and no one is falling for his tricks that Wang Jingwei has to painstakingly conduct secret negotiations. When his master refuses to provide the millions of dollars in loans, his mouthpiece newspapers cry out, "Why should we organize a central government? Are we also going to become traitors?" This is enough to prove that as long as our compatriots are resolute, Wang Jingwei's treacherous schemes will definitely not succeed, and the Japanese warlords will not be able to realize their lucky, insidious plot. After Wang Jingwei signs this secret agreement, what does he plan to do next? What means will the Japanese take? These are questions that are bound to arise in the minds of all our compatriots, but I believe that these are not important and not worth paying attention to. As long as we maintain our consistent national policy and resolutely resist Japan, we will naturally be able to dispel these ghostly shadows with the light of ultimate victory. First, let's talk about Wang. Wang was extremely complacent as the agreement neared signing. First, his mouthpiece, the China Daily, said something like, "A comprehensive peace is impossible to achieve; there is no other way but to strive for a comprehensive peace through local peace." Then, Wang himself issued a telegram on December 29th last year, saying, "The only remaining questions are whether the principles of peace can be realized and whether the peace plan can be completed." He also said, "Whether the specific conditions for peace can be obtained depends on the peace movement after it is achieved, and its realization also depends on the peace movement." This is partly to conceal the fact that he is secretly signing the agreement, and partly to look up to his master's countenance. Therefore, from today onwards, he will inevitably still devote himself to his so-called "peace movement," which is to try to "strive for a comprehensive peace through local peace." He will certainly try to gather ugly elements, form a puppet government, steal legitimacy, and act as the main body for implementing this "Outline for the Adjustment of the New Sino-Japanese Relationship." He may even think that even if no third country recognizes his puppet government, he can still create some disputes and troubles, so that some countries will have de facto relations with his puppet government. As for "local peace," what does he mean by "local?" This means that the city of Nanjing, occupied by the Japanese army, is the "local" that he can sell. Then, using this "local" as a base, and borrowing the power of his master, he will confront the soldiers and civilians of our nation resisting Japan, and harm every compatriot who does not want to be a slave to a foreign power, and thereby vainly attempt to achieve "comprehensive peace," which is to sell the entire nation in order to satisfy his master's great desires. This is his plan. He says he can no longer have any concerns, but I want to ask our compatriots, do we have no concerns about this? We do not pay attention to his puppet organization, and even less do we care about how he will "strive for a comprehensive peace." We only recognize that no matter what name he steals, he is ultimately a slave of Japan. Slaves have no independent personality. We are now focused on resisting Japan until we eliminate his master, the warlords. Once his master is eliminated, wouldn't the parasitic slave also be finished? However, Chinese history will simply add another Qin Hui, Liu Yu, and Zhang Bangchang to be reviled by later generations. Chinese national consciousness and the distinction between Chinese and barbarians is a time for sharpening and promoting every time there is a traitor and national scoundrel. I believe that the loyal and passionate struggle of our soldiers and civilians will inevitably become stronger, more valiant, and more widespread as the act of treason becomes more concrete. As for what the Japanese will do afterwards, we can also roughly predict. I guess the Japanese actions will be one of two paths. One path is to present the puppet while "scraping together their meager resources" and mobilizing their remaining forces to continue to intensify their attacks on us, so that their military can demand military expenses from the parliament and at the same time appease the dissatisfaction of their people. The second possible path is that they themselves feel that their strength is exhausted. If they mobilize other troops, even their own country will experience turmoil. Once the puppet appears, they will take the opportunity to declare the "end of the incident," and simply station their troops in the occupied areas, neither daring to advance further nor daring to retreat, in order to comfort the anti-war sentiment in their country, in order to ease their breathing, and then support the puppet to use Chinese to control Chinese. However, both of these paths are clearly dead ends for them. First, let's talk about the second path. To be honest, if they want to end this way, if they want to stop this way, there is no such cheap thing. If the Japanese army does not withdraw completely, our battle will not stop for a single day. If they want to retreat and defend, can't we counterattack? If they want to use all their strength to consolidate the occupied areas, won't we seize the opportunity to recover our lost territories? Let's talk about the first path, which is to extract the five divisions they can mobilize at home and abroad to intensify their attacks. We have been preparing for this all along, and we are confident that we will be able to succeed. The people of the whole country know that since the battles in southern Guangxi and northern Guangdong at the end of last year, in the past month and a half, they have repeatedly decided to mobilize reinforcements, and they have repeatedly lost troops and generals. We have already tested the strength of their supposedly most elite Fifth Division and the Konoe Division. Today, I can clearly say that three years ago, the enemy妄想thought we China would surrender in North China without a fight. Today, three years later, we will make the Japanese warlords die in the battlefield of South China without a fight, or even be defeated without a fight. The discipline and spirit of the Japanese army are beyond our expectations. What they are relying on now is only their relatively superior weapons, but weapons must be used by troops with fighting spirit. Now, the domestic economic crisis is deepening day by day, diplomacy is at a loss, and there is no way out. The atmosphere of anti-war sentiment is permeating the whole country. This unstable factor is naturally reflected in the morale of the front lines. At the Fifth Plenary Session last year, I thoroughly discussed the ways in which the Japanese would inevitably be defeated, saying that they have fallen into a difficult and deadly situation, and are everywhere in a position where they cannot advance or retreat. Since they invaded Nanning, whether in terms of weather, geography, or human relations, they have been in a desperate situation. The time of their final defeat is not far away. We are only waiting for the time of their final destruction to come, and then we will annihilate them in one fell swoop. Now, not to mention that we are giving the Japanese army active and continuous blows anytime and anywhere, even if we wage a passive defensive war with them, we can still make them die without a fight and hasten their final defeat. Just look at the battlefield in Shanxi. They have always maintained more than six divisions, supplementing them time and time again. I don't know how many times they have been supplemented, and it has been fighting for two years now, but our Shanxi remains the same. Now, comparing Shanxi with the terrain and climate of Guangdong and Guangxi, not to mention that the terrain of Guangdong and Guangxi is mountainous and the transportation is difficult, and the miasma is pervasive and diseases are prevalent, how can the Japanese army, with the living habits of island people and the training of fighting in the plains, enter such an area without dying from disease? I can also say that if the Japanese army enters this area, they will die from exhaustion even if they don't die from disease. Even if we don't use our forces to surround them, the special natural terrain and climate there, this natural force, can control the fate of the Japanese army and make them all exhausted and die. The more troops they send, the greater our chance of annihilating them, and the faster our final victory will be. Therefore, the Japanese invasion of Guangdong and Guangxi is originally a suicide. They only occupied Guangzhou the year before last, or they have not tasted enough of this bitterness of dying from disease, and they did not even think of the trick of dying from exhaustion, so they dared to attack Nanning at the end of last year. This is their final adventure. We will force them to increase their reinforcements in this area, realize the principle of making them die without a fight, and create our final victory. As for other battlefields, we will continue to consume them on the one hand, and actively strike at them on the other hand, so that they will meet our favorable tactics and come to seek their own destruction. In short, in military terms, I have repeatedly stated that I am confident that we have a full grasp of victory. Moreover, this time the disclosure of the Japanese-Wang agreement has deepened the resentment of our soldiers on the front lines and should serve as a powerful proclamation to boost the morale of the officers and soldiers of the nation. Our compatriots and soldiers throughout the country must now know that not fighting is extinction, not fighting bloody battles is to wait to be killed, and to be sold as slaves. How can we endure this humiliation? How can we not seek the survival of our country and win back our country's dignity? Now, the Japanese cabinet has been changed again and again, and the desperate gamble of the young militarists will not only drag down the 60 million people of Japan to seek their own death, but also disrupt East Asia and cause great disasters for all mankind. This is the most critical moment for the fate of East Asia and the safety of the world. The meaning of our resistance is to safeguard the independence and survival of the nation and the people at all costs, and to act as a shield for international conventions and the happiness of East Asia. Our responsibility is truly of utmost importance. We are now stepping on the most difficult stage that must be passed before the final victory. I deeply hope that all my compatriots and all the soldiers of the whole army will take this opportunity to redouble their efforts and struggle to recover our rivers and mountains, complete the national revolution, and realize the solemn mission of the Three Principles of the People.

<h3 id="e29">Romania's Control of Oil Production and Sales Causes Anxiety in Britain and France; Romania Claims It Is for National Defense Needs, and the Amount of Oil Shipped to Germany Has Increased <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>London A recent article published by the London Romanian official news agency, discussing Romania's implementation of a new plan to control and adjust the production and refining of oil mines, stated that the reorganization of Romania's oil mines is purely for internal needs and should not cause concern abroad. The publication of this article is intended to dispel the Allies' concerns that Germany will now have a large supply of oil from Romania. It is reported that Romania believes that the establishment of the new oil department and the supply department have the same purpose, which is to meet Romania's national defense needs. According to the statement, oil and its by-products account for 62% of Romania's total exports. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a domestic agency to adjust its production, domestic consumption, and foreign exports. The law establishing the oil department was passed on January 15, authorizing the department to manage the development of oil mines and oil issues. The establishment of the new oil department is part of the Romanian government's outline for revitalizing and adjusting domestic production. Currently, it is also planning to establish similar agencies to adjust the domestic mining and metallurgy industries. This plan is purely based on domestic needs and should not cause concern abroad. (Reuter, 25th)</p>
<p>London According to well-informed sources here, regarding the commercial relations between Romania and Germany, the British government is now making inquiries to the Romanian government to clarify the truth, especially regarding the issue of Romania's oil supply to Germany. There are many rumors outside. Therefore, Britain and France have already begun to exchange views. It is reported that Romania has recently shipped a large amount of oil to Germany, but whether the quantity is actually greater than that stipulated in the bilateral commercial agreement, or whether Romania intends to increase the oil supply quantity but has not yet done so, is still difficult to say at this time. However, considering the current transportation difficulties, the second speculation seems to be more accurate. This is expressed dissatisfaction among British political figures, who say that Britain will never tolerate Romania's actions to satisfy Germany's economic needs. However, Romanian figures here say that Germany has been exerting increasing pressure on Romania, and that Britain has failed to increase its purchases from Romania, so that Romania can resist German pressure. This is disappointing. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<p>Paris Although the French public pays close attention to Germany's economic pressure on Romania, the level of concern is not as great as in Britain. It is generally believed that King Carol II of Romania will not yield to Germany. The German economist Clodius has recently visited the Romanian capital several times to hold talks with the Romanian authorities, attempting to persuade Romania to increase the amount of oil supplied to Germany. The Romanian government has also organized a national oil committee to control the production and export of oil and to regulate British and French oil companies within the country. However, there are still some difficulties hindering German-Romanian commercial relations, such as transportation difficulties and a shortage of oil trucks. However, diplomatic figures say that the German army has already entered the Soviet-occupied region of eastern Galicia to protect the railway traffic through the province between Germany and Romania. This move is clearly a major threat to Romania. In addition, after the German army entered eastern Galicia, rumors were rampant, which was enough to make the Romanian authorities feel uneasy. But in reality, Germany may not want to take immediate military action in the Balkans. Its real intention is to threaten the Balkan countries and seek the maximum amount of economic assistance. That is all. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<p>Bucharest Today, a responsible statement was issued here denying that Romania's new oil control measures are intended to benefit Germany. It is claimed that because oil production has declined, there is a need to adjust the oil industry. Romania, in view of the current dangerous international situation, also urgently needs to stock up on oil. (Reuter, 25th)</p>

<p>London According to today's news, among the tens of thousands of packages and letters confiscated by the British authorities as contraband from the start of the war until January 22, one package was sent from Japan to Germany and contained pearls worth 8,000 British pounds. According to the Department of Economic Warfare, a total of 6,000 contraband letters and 50,000 packages were confiscated during this period. There were many food packages sent from the United States to Germany, all of which were considered contraband and confiscated. Many letters contained remittances or letters of credit, and some contained mark notes. It is reported that the British authorities have confiscated a total of 5,279,000 German marks worth of gold marks, 426,000 US dollars in drafts, 7,900 US dollars in cash, and 7,800 British pounds in cash. Those sending marks from the United States to Germany would purchase marks from German banks in the United States, obtain a paper receipt, and send it directly to Germany. The recipient could then use the receipt to withdraw cash from the bank. Therefore, German banks in the United States have obtained a considerable amount of foreign currency. Industrial diamonds worth one million British pounds were found in the mail, but most of them were sent to neutral countries, so they were allowed to pass. It was also found that large envelopes sent to neutral countries often contained letters entrusted to be sent to Germany. (Reuter, 25th)</p>

Japan has long attached importance to countries bordering the Soviet Union. As for Hungary, it has already occupied the Czech Carpatho-Ukraine province, and the Soviet Union has already occupied the Polish Galicia province. The territories of the two countries have already met, and it is natural that Japan pays attention to them. Generally speaking, the Japanese envoys and consuls should exchange information about the Soviet Union obtained in the capitals of their respective countries for reference. (Havas, 25th)</p>
<p>Rome Japanese envoys and consuls stationed in European countries are scheduled to hold a meeting in the capital of Hungary on the 27th and 28th of this month. The Japanese Ambassador to Italy, Ōba, has already departed to attend and had a long conversation with Foreign Minister Ciano before his departure. The discussion focused on the Far East situation.

<h3 id="e33">Shigemitsu Visits British Foreign Secretary to Discuss the Asama Maru Incident; Japanese Steamship Company Denies Unconfirmed Reports of Refusing Passage to Germans of Conscription Age and Inspection of the Tatsuta Maru <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>London - Ambassador Shigemitsu, acting on instructions from the Foreign Ministry, visited British Foreign Secretary Halifax at 10:00 AM on the 24th to explain the Japanese government's attitude towards the Asama Maru incident and public opinion in Japan. He requested the British government to give the matter careful consideration. The British Foreign Secretary replied that there was no change in the British policy of maintaining friendly relations with Japan. He stated that the British government, due to the German government recalling submarine pilots from around the world based on their operational intentions, inspected the Asama Maru to prevent their plans. Their intention was solely to prosecute the war against Germany and did not intend to harm Japanese feelings. The British Foreign Secretary also hoped that Japan would understand Britain's position in trying to prevent Germany's plans. The meeting concluded at 10:30 AM. It is reported that Ambassador Shigemitsu will continue to meet with the Foreign Secretary in the future. (24th, Domei News Agency)</p>
<p>London - Regarding the case of the Japanese steamship Asama Maru, after the Japanese government lodged a protest with the British government, the British government submitted a reply today. The content of the reply remains undisclosed by informed sources. However, according to diplomatic sources, the 21 Germans captured by the British Navy on the Asama Maru will likely not be released. There is still a possibility of a compromise between Britain and Japan, namely, a solution that respects Japan's prestige while not violating Britain's blockade policy against Germany. Political figures state that, according to reports from San Francisco, the Japanese steamship company has decided not to carry German nationals of conscription age in the future. If this measure is widely implemented, it could completely resolve the current dispute. In Tokyo, the indignation expressed regarding this case stems from the fact that the Asama Maru was intercepted by a British warship within a Japanese naval protection zone. However, from the British perspective, any action that could aid Germany must be prevented, regardless of the circumstances. In short, if Japan can provide some guarantees, a solution to the Asama Maru case should be found. However, given the difficulty in verifying the practical implementation of these guarantees, further friction may arise in the future. (25th, Havas News Agency)</p>
<p>Tokyo - British Ambassador Sir Robert Craigie issued a statement today, saying, "Based on the commentaries in Japanese newspapers and the opinions expressed by many Japanese visitors to the British Embassy, I feel that the Japanese people have many misunderstandings about the real points of contention in the Asama Maru case. For example, the general public is talking about the interception of a Japanese ship as an insult to Japan. Therefore, I want to assure my Japanese friends that Britain does not wish to take any action that would harm Japan's prestige unless absolutely necessary. The actions of the British warships against the Asama Maru were an exercise of belligerent rights, and there was no other intention. German warships have repeatedly exercised belligerent rights against the ships of neutral countries and taken British people off ships. This shows that the real issue between Britain and Japan is whether German men of military age, who are under orders to return home to serve in the military and whose expenses are paid by the German government, can be intercepted and taken off neutral ships according to international law, and whether such action is limited to enemies actually serving in the German military. This question can certainly be resolved by our two governments in a calm atmosphere, avoiding mutual resentment. I hold this hope, so I have given a brief explanation of this point of contention based on what I have seen." (25th, Reuters)</p>
<p>San Francisco - After the Asama Maru, belonging to the Japanese steamship company, was intercepted by a British warship and the Germans on board were captured, the company decided that in the future, it would not allow any German passengers of conscription age to board. Takahashi, the manager of the company's San Francisco branch, told the press that German passengers who wish to travel on the company's steamships in the future must provide documentation proving that they are not affiliated with the army or navy and are not returning home under orders from the German government before being allowed to board. It is noted that the 512 crew members of the escaped German steamship Columbus originally planned to board a Japanese ship at Ellis Island to return home. Now that the company has taken the above decision, these crew members will likely be unable to return home. (25th, Havas News Agency)</p>
<p>Tokyo - According to a Japanese Navy spokesperson at a press conference today, "The Japanese Navy is now preparing to prevent the recurrence of the Asama Maru incident." However, the Japanese side is unwilling to disclose the measures it is preparing during the negotiation process. "The current issue is not the capture of the 21 Germans, but the fact that this incident, which damages Japan's 'prestige,' occurred right at Japan's doorstep. It would be extremely foolish to let this incident harm the relations between Britain and Japan." The public sentiment in Japan is now very agitated and cannot be resolved by negotiations on whether it complies with international law. Japan may follow the example of the neutral zone in the Americas and set up a neutral zone to prevent the recurrence of this type of incident. Furthermore, the British warship that searched the Asama Maru did not observe the etiquette stipulated by international law. The British warship did not inform the captain of the Asama Maru of the name of the warship, nor did it leave a document certifying the capture of the 21 Germans. As for Japan, in its war against China, it has always adopted strict measures to prevent the shipment of arms to China, fearing that it would hinder the shipping of third countries. (25th, United Press)</p>
<p>Tokyo - The Japanese Foreign Ministry received news that the steamship Tatsuta Maru had been detained and searched by British warships in the waters near Hawaii. On the afternoon of the 24th, it immediately sent a telegram to Kato, the Consul-General in Honolulu, to investigate the truth of the incident. However, contrary to this, Consul-General Kato sent a telegram to the Foreign Ministry reporting that, "The Tatsuta Maru departed from San Francisco on the 18th, and while sailing towards Honolulu, there was a rumor that it was suddenly detained and searched by a British warship. We immediately telegraphed the Tatsuta Maru to inquire about the truth, and received a reply from the ship stating that at 10:50 PM on the 18th, 70 miles from San Francisco, an unidentified vessel, resembling a warship, signaled from a distance of 2 miles inquiring about the ship's name and destination. After replying, another reply was received at 11:05 AM stating that it was continuing to sail. As the telegram states, the Tatsuta Maru was only questioned about its name and destination by a ship of unknown nationality in the Pacific Ocean near San Francisco, and was not detained or searched in any way."

<h3 id="e36">Visiting the Battleground of Kunlun Pass: The Strong Wind on the Mountain Top Cannot Sweep Away the Stench of Japanese Corpses; Japanese Troops Tenaciously Defend Batang to Prevent Chinese Troops from Advancing Towards Yong; the Perilousness of Kunlun Pass is Evidenced by Poetry <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>Qianjiang Correspondence, January 10, 3:00 PM - The desperate cries of the Japanese war eagles disappeared from the skies above the Guinan Front. I left the command post of the Xth Army, following General Du Yuming, who directly commanded X0,000 troops to retake Kunlun Pass, and proceeded south along the highway. From XX to Kunlun Pass, there are only X kilometers. All along the mountain road, with unusual excitement, I searched for the glorious battleground with hungry eyes, scaling mountain after mountain.</p>
<p>The sun cast dark shadows on everything, as if it were the early summer in the north. High and low, soldiers sang while working. Tanks wore coats of green leaves like Adam and Eve. Large trucks, fully loaded with ammunition, went ahead, and lightly loaded trucks carried a few wounded soldiers back. Thick dust could not cover their clean white bandages. The bright red bloodstains on them were such a dazzling color in this green mountain country. Especially their eyes, although somewhat tired, were full of the light of victory.</p>
<p>Getting off the car at the mouth of the mountain pass east of Tongxing, I stepped onto the battlefield where life and death, master and slave, were decided ten days ago. On the hillside, tree trunks as thick as bowls were cut off by shrapnel. Between them, shell craters with scorched edges were spread out, leaving behind only the loneliness of death. This area of high ground was the Japanese position in front of Kunlun Pass, stubbornly defended by the 5th Division to protect Kunlun Pass. But how long ago was it that it returned to the embrace of the motherland, becoming a strong rear guard for our Kunlun Pass? At the foot of the mountain, the Japanese fortifications were still intact. These were embankments dug along the mountain, cleverly hidden in dead corners in many directions, while they themselves could mutually form a dense crossfire network. Chinese soldiers used hand grenades to charge under this crossfire. Some embankments were blown up, some were empty. The Japanese youths inside gradually retreated to the top of the mountain, and eventually became war ghosts in a foreign country. - One earthen pit contained more than eighty corpses. On the left side of the highway, at Jieshou, was the last place abandoned by the Japanese. We dug up a mass grave of more than sixty corpses. Near these two strongholds, the Japanese had deployed its only two tank defense guns to prevent the impact of Chinese tanks. But it was finally broken through three times by a very small number of Chinese tanks - and according to the principles of combat, this area was originally not a place where tanks could exert their power. The highway reached the north end of Kunlun Pass, then made a horseshoe-shaped curve to the west, bypassing the high ground on the right side of Kunlun Pass, and then returning to the downhill road south of the pass to Jiutang. We took the ancient road to the north entrance of Kunlun Pass. A guard led the way with a light machine gun. Lu Duo, the Ming Dynasty Guozijijiu of Jingling, once wrote a poem describing the scenery of this section: "On the road to Kunlun Mountain, in the middle of the forest, the sky cannot be seen. The nest is low and the birds protect it, the trees are old and the strange vines are entwined. The empty green seems to drip, the shady cliffs warn the roadside. Moving forward, you know it is not far away, the buildings are separated by the misty smoke." However, the poet has passed away, but the scenery still exists. After hundreds of years, it has not lost its steep and dangerous shape, and it is still a strategically important area for soldiers. The smell of corpses on the roadside assaulted us with the wind, making us unable to help but cover our noses and pass by. Thinking of the parents, wives, and daughters of these victims who were driven to wage a war of aggression, still far away in the east of the East China Sea, praying and silently blessing every day, I couldn't help but feel some emotion. The mountain peaks turned and the road twisted, and Kunlun stood to greet us. The pass hidden in these jagged heights did not give a feeling of majesty at first sight. This is because it is viewed with modern eyes. In ancient times, the first thing in battle was to capture the pass, so that the army could move. In modern times, it is to seize the high ground to control a certain strategic pass and then occupy it. In this battle of Kunlun Pass, both sides fought with all their strength to seize the high ground around Kunlun Pass. It itself was not the focus of artillery fire. Therefore, this ancient famous pass has not been baptized by modern artillery fire and still retains its vibrant ancient charm. After taking pictures at the "Kunlun Pass" pass, we entered the pass. The setting sun was already hanging in the distant mountain depression, shining obliquely through the dense jungle, making the plaque with the four characters "Wei Zhen Nan Jiang" (Majestically Guarding the Southern Border) particularly clear. Branches of unknown red flowers drooped from the gaps in the rubble of the gate, swaying delicately in the breeze. Ascending the pass from the stone steps on the left, there are three halls, which were rebuilt by Liu Jiqing, the magistrate of Dao Guang in the 26th year, but they are already very dilapidated. Di Wuxiang Gong (Qing) is enshrined in the middle.</p>
<p>Regarding Di Qing's suppression of Nong Zhigao, both official history and unofficial history have detailed records. The story can be retold by quoting Qing Liu Yuanqing's "Kunlun Guan Di Wuxiang Zhan Chu Shi": "West of Yue is Kunlun, rugged and towering, uniquely squatting. One mountain sits on both sides of the boundary between Bin and Yong, no less than Taihang and Jianmen. I remember that the Guangyuan Zhou barbarians invaded, and the Lingnan territory was ravaged. Who asked who held the ax to specialize in the expedition? Wuxiang combined his troops with Sun Hecong. At that time, it happened to be the Lantern Festival. Drinking in the mansion was full of joy, but suddenly reported that Kunlun was broken at two drums. The divine machine was unpredictable and called a divine philosopher. It has been more than five hundred years since then. People have gone and the traces remain, and the achievements can be passed on. Climbing the mountain and looking for the relics, I only see grass and grass."</p>
<p>There are dozens of houses inside the pass, which were already very old. After being ravaged by the Japanese army, only the four walls remain. Descending dozens of steps to the south, there is another gate, which is not much different from ordinary doors, but more solid. Outside the gate, the cold sound of water came from the side of the slope. Chen Fu of the Yuan Dynasty wrote a poem about Kunlun: "Yesterday I passed Dalin Pass, the sour smoke and poisonous fog of mountains and mountains. Today I passed Kunlun Pass, the cold spring roared and the sound was gurgling. The banyan leaves by the roadside are as dense as woven, thousands of branches and leaves between the cliffs... I waved my iron whip out of the pass, and the peacock flew down to the Cangjiang Bay." Shangyuan Xie Shaonan's twenty rhymes of Kunlun Pass also said: "Walking on Kunlun, majestic as tigers and leopards. The peaks rise out of ten thousand stones, and the pass opens two red. The land is high and south is pressed, and the mountains are far and north are connected to the sky. The cliffs contain ancient rafts, and the flying rocks brush the grass. ... The sloping slope prevents the spinning horses, and the stagnant depression suddenly rises the rainbow... The tiles are built without front, and the ladder hangs and loses its upward attack..." It is really a descriptive poem that has not changed to this day, and at the same time, it can be seen that the southern side of Kunlun Pass is shaped. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Taixian Correspondence - The Chinese guerrilla units in northern Jiangsu are constantly launching counterattacks against the Japanese troops on various lines, and have achieved significant victories. The Chinese troops on the Tongyu Road have recently closely encircled the county town of Rugao, and once recaptured Dongchen Town in the county, and charged into the streets for street fighting. Many Japanese and puppet troops were annihilated. The Japanese army has repeatedly telegraphed Nantong for reinforcements, showing great panic. The main purpose of this Chinese military offensive is to disrupt the Japanese attempt to absorb economic resources from northern Jiangsu. A Chinese troop recently charged into Tangjia Zha in Nantong and destroyed the cotton collection company established by the Japanese. All the capital in the company was also taken away. Due to the continuous defeats in recent days, the Japanese army has launched a "rumor offensive." On the morning of the 14th, a Japanese plane flew over Taixian and dropped absurd leaflets containing threats, attempting to ease the siege on that front. Recently, the Japanese navy also attempted to invade Yangzhong County in the Yangtze River, assembling warships and engaging in fierce battles with the defending troops on the shore. The troops stationed there are under the command of the Xth Advance Detachment of the New Fourth Army in southern Jiangsu, and their strength is exceptionally strong. The Japanese army has so far been unable to make progress, and fierce fighting is still ongoing.</p>

<p>Suzhou Correspondence - Mudu Town is located more than 30 miles outside the Xu Gate of Wuxian County. It is the most important town in Wuxian County. There is the Su-Fu Highway for transportation. Since the fall of the town, Japanese troops have been stationed in places such as the Shijia Hotel. Some local bullies took the opportunity to loot, abduct people for ransom, and the villagers suffered greatly. At the end of last year, a Chinese militia battalion secretly moved into the nearby XX villages and established contact with the regular army. They actively destroyed the highway and attacked Japanese trucks. On the 14th of this month, the puppet district office in this town convened a joint celebration for Japanese and puppet troops. Dozens of Japanese officers, as well as puppet police officers and puppet personnel, attended, totaling nearly a hundred people. The entire town was placed under martial law by the puppet self-defense corps. The Chinese militia team learned of this and the battalion commander, Wang Yangxiao, led the entire militia to surround the puppet district office in four directions, and bravely charged in. After an hour of fighting, rifles and hand grenades exploded. Seeing the situation was not good, the Japanese and puppet troops rushed to escape. As a result, forty to fifty Japanese and puppet personnel were killed or injured. More than ten Chinese militiamen also died heroically. The puppet district chief, Mr. Mi, was captured alive by the militiamen. After being interrogated by battalion commander Wang Yangxiao, he was executed on the spot. Seeing that the objective had been achieved, the Chinese militiamen safely returned to their original defenses. Later, the Japanese army in Suzhou sent a battalion to rush to the scene and searched every household in the town, arresting dozens of innocent civilians, who have not yet been released.</p>

<p>The annual Sino-Western Open Seven-Mile Team Cross-Country Championship, organized by the Hongkou Cross-Country Team, will start at 8:00 AM on the 4th of next month in front of Guangxia Middle School on Mulmein Road. Registration closed last Saturday. A total of fifteen teams are participating, including Dong Sele, Qingguang A, B, and C, Youqiang A and B, Mingfeng, Jiyi, Dongguang, and Hongkou A, B, and C. Each team will field eight players, and the scores of the top six will be counted. Huizhen Cross-Country Team, which won double championships in the previous competition and has held the "Hongkou Cup" for one year, will be absent. The organizers hope that Huizhen will return, and even if they have missed the registration deadline, their request will not be rejected. The third practice race this weekend will still gather and start at Guangxia Middle School on Mulmein Road at 7:15 AM, rain or shine. The Hongkou Cross-Country Team was organized by Mr. Liang Yaoting, a passionate figure in the sports community, and has a long history. The team once organized a sixteen-mile long-distance relay race on May 23, 1937, before the war, which was a grand event and very successful. Recently, Mr. Liang decided to restore and continue to organize it, and plans to increase the distance. The starting location is still under discussion.</p>

<h3 id="e55">Rice is Expensive, Oil is Expensive, Flour is Expensive, Soybeans and Wheat are Expensive: The Necessities of Life are All Expensive; Are the People's Food Being Used as a Football by Speculators? How Can Half the People's Livelihoods Not Be Difficult? <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>Jing Rice: The manipulation of the market is the same as flour and wheat, with each manipulating each other, harming people's livelihoods, which has been happening for days. Therefore, it has repeatedly risen recently. Yesterday, it was further raised sharply due to strong demand. Those hoarding goods and merchants from other places, seeing that the opportunity had arrived, were unwilling to release goods. Although there was still some buying and selling of returned goods, it was still not enough. Under this environment, the prices of all goods continued to rise. For example, each type of thick Jing rice was scarce on the market. Only Li Sheng Jing was offered at 40 yuan, and Qing Si Te Bo was also offered at 40 yuan. Songfeng and other goods were also sold for 39.8 yuan to 39.5 yuan. The early rice from Nangang was similar. Baiyuan Gao was offered at 40 yuan, and then down to 38 yuan, which was more than half a yuan higher than the previous closing price, depending on the quality of the rice.</p>
<p>Foreign Rice: Yesterday, the market had a more active demand from shops. Merchants and hoarders from Nanjing, Zhenjiang and other places were greedy, and the prices abroad were also high. The market showed a prosperous scene. The prices of various grades were consistently rising. Spot goods were 300 to 400 yuan more expensive. Saigon and Huojiao rice were the most popular and were traded in bulk. From morning to noon, the prices kept rising, with no less than 6,000 to 7,000 bags traded. The prices also rose by 500 to 600 yuan. For example, No. 1 Saigon was offered at 40 yuan, and No. 2 Saigon was priced at 39.7 to 39.8 yuan, No. 2 Saigon at 39.2 to 39.3 yuan, Huojiao rice at 38.5 yuan, Tokyo Tip Top at 37 yuan, then down to 35.8 yuan, Siamese rice Lu at 35.6 to 35.7 yuan, Saigon broken rice at 33 yuan, rice bran at 31 yuan to 30 yuan, and Hong Kong glutinous rice Lu at 35 yuan. However, grain merchants were quite active in ordering. Due to the increase in water freight and military insurance, the asking price for No. 1 Saigon had risen to 50 yuan, and No. 2 Saigon was also asking for 49 yuan. Subsequently, grain merchant Xinfeng contacted Jianyuan and agreed to a 1,000-ton telegraph agreement at a price of 48.7 yuan. In terms of price control, Ding'an broken Saigon rice was set at 500 tons at a price of 17.65 yuan.</p>
<p>Flour: Yesterday, the spot flour market was deliberately quiet by the manufacturers, who stopped selling to merchants and restricted retail sales in this street. Therefore, only 30 to 50 bags and 100 to 200 bags of actual sales were made throughout the day. Larger quantities were rejected and not opened. The selling price of returned goods was very different from the factory price, and there was also fear of repeated price hikes, which would cause more public criticism. Therefore, those with order forms generally kept them and did not release them, making the market more deserted. Foreign flour holders were still unwilling to let go easily. There were occasional transactions of invoices. The prices of brands such as Double Eagle and Paotai were still between 11.5 and 11.6 yuan. The foreign soldier ship brand of the northern gang was more popular and sold at a higher price than other brands. At a time when all parties were hoarding goods, the future of flour prices was destined to rise easily and fall with difficulty.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday, the wheat market trend was unusually firm. The source from the mainland was blocked, the inventory in Shanghai was dwindling, and foreign flour wheat could not be shipped to Shanghai for a while. Therefore, those who held the goods had been hoarding them for a long time. Although new high prices were emerging one after another, their ambition had not diminished. Yesterday, the price for Chinese flour mills was also at 20 yuan. Fufeng Mill took 2,000 bags, and Fuxin Mill took 500 bags. Wheat from Suzhou, Changzhou, and Wuxi was all offered at 20 yuan, wheat from Zhenjiang at 19.9 yuan, and wheat from Yangzhou, which was offered at 19.75 yuan to 19.7 yuan the day before yesterday, was offered at 19.8 yuan yesterday. The market situation was even tighter than before.</p>
<p>Soybean Oil: The hearts of people in the market were excited again. Speculators opened their bloody mouths, put on smiling faces, and were extremely excited, regardless of the fact that ordinary people could not afford oil. As a result, Dalian crude oil opened at 97.5 yuan and rose in a straight line to 100 yuan. The "kicking the ball" market reached 102 yuan at the close, a sharp increase of 4.5 yuan in one day. The frenzy in the market was no less than the situation in early last year. Therefore, actual sales were squeezed out in the afternoon. A total of 100 pieces of Kai Yanqi oil were sold at a price of 80 yuan, 100 dans of Dayou factory oil were sold at a price of 82 yuan, and 400 barrels of Dalian crude oil were sold at prices ranging from 97.5 yuan to 102 yuan. Peanut oil: Merchants from Hong Kong suddenly inquired, and the market became clear and lively. More than 1,000 cans of Jiangbei oil, 1,500 cans of Yantai oil, and 500 cans of Qingdao oil were traded.</p>
<p>Soybeans: Since the arrival volume of soybeans has decreased, traders have been buying retail in the market, leading to powerful figures fanning the flames and creating an unprecedented record. Yesterday, the soybean market rose by 500 yuan, but the trading volume decreased. Actual sales accounted for only one-third of the total. A total of more than 1,000 bags of Kai Jiaozhou soybeans were traded, with prices rising from 21 yuan to 21.5 yuan. Two cars of Nanjing soybeans were successfully traded at a price of 19.56 yuan. More than 600 bags of Wuhu soybeans were traded at prices ranging from 20.05 yuan to 21 yuan. Other Pinghu soybeans were traded for 50 bags at a price of 22.55 yuan, and 300 bags of Chongming sand yellow soybeans were traded at a price of 20.09 yuan and 21.45 yuan.</p>
<p>Exports: Yesterday, 1,377 bags of soybeans, 2,680 bags of raw peanuts, and 4,266 cans of raw oil were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3 id="e56">Finance: Sassoon Actively Covers Forward Positions; Hong Kong Continues to Hold Back Foreign Exchange <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>The foreign exchange market yesterday showed no fluctuations in the HSBC listing. The informal markets for British and American exchange rates were unremarkable. Although the trend showed a slight easing, the overall situation was still not optimistic. However, the bullish sentiment of Chinese and Western speculators could not be dispelled, so it was not easy to see lower prices. But the basis for Hong Kong electricity exports was still maintained, so there was still equilibrium. The trading situation today initially showed a state of British equilibrium and American easing due to the rise of overseas American and British exchange rates by 1.375. Later, because Sassoon had been accumulating forward positions, the situation once tightened to 4 pence 65625 and 7 yuan 71875. Subsequently, because there was profit-taking, and Hong Kong electricity exports and China Bank were also selling, although Sassoon came back to absorb, the market finally hardened. By noon, it had extended to 4 pence 6875 and 7 yuan 78125. The afternoon situation was very quiet. Although Chinese merchants were accumulating, China Bank was selling, and the price was unaffected. At the evening close, it was still 4 pence 6875 and 7 yuan 78125. As a result, it eased slightly by 0.015625 and 0.0625 compared to the previous day. The potential for futures was similar to the spot market, but the American exchange rate for January and February was slightly higher.</p>
<p>Morning: Tightened Once</p>
<p>In the early morning, London's big bar and American bank prices remained flat. London raw gold was fixed, and the exchange rates for British against American, Shanghai, and French were all flat. American was up by 1.375 against British, unchanged against Shanghai, and up by 1 against French. The central listing of various exchange rates remained the same. The bank's morning opening selling price for spot goods was 4 pence 671875 for British gold and 7.75 for American exchange, slightly easing by 0.03125 for American exchange compared to the previous close due to the continued rise in exchange rates. Later, Sassoon first came to the outer lines of Daitong, Huabi, etc. to accumulate the American exchange rate for the month of 7.625 and the British gold for the same month at 4 pence 609375, and the situation was still relatively stable. When HSBC announced that its listing was unmoved and the balancing tax on silver was also unchanged, Sassoon continued to cover American exchange in February at only 7.59375, and the market slightly softened. At that time, the spot price also shrank to 4 pence 65625 yuan and 71875 yuan. Later, Sassoon stopped accumulating, and external lines came forward to release profits, so the situation returned to equilibrium. It is calculated that Hong Kong electricity sold to the external line spot British gold at 4 pence 6875 and the spot American exchange rate at 7 yuan 78125. At that time, China Bank sold to Sassoon the American exchange rate for the month of 7.65625. Extending to the noon closing, the bank's spot selling price was still 4 pence 6875 for British gold and 7.75 for American exchange, slightly easing by 0.05625 for British compared to the morning opening, but American was unchanged.</p>
<p>Closing Ultimately Saw Easing</p>
<p>The afternoon market was calm, and the market continued to harden slightly. China Bank, Overseas Chinese, once sold the American exchange rate for February to Chinese merchants at 7.625. Until the evening closing, the bank's spot selling price was 4 pence 6875 for British gold, 7 yuan 78125 for American exchange, the same as the previous month for British gold, 7 yuan 75 for American exchange, 4 pence 625 for British gold for the next month, and 7 yuan 625 for American exchange. As a result, the spot price eased by 0.015625 for British gold and rose by 0.625 for American exchange compared to the previous day. The futures price also eased by 0.015625 for British gold and rose by 0.02125 for American exchange.</p>
<p>Hong Kong British Exchange Slightly Shrank</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 25th: The market opened flat this morning. The spot price for British exchange tightened by 0.02125 to 1 shilling 2 pence 90625. The forward price was unchanged. The spot price for American exchange eased by 0.0625 to 24 yuan 6875. The spot price for Shanghai exchange decreased by 1 yuan to 316 yuan. The Japanese exchange rate increased by 25 to 104 yuan 75. At 11:30 AM, it was calm and unchanged. The market opened steadily at 2:30 PM in the afternoon. The British exchange rate and the Japanese exchange rate were unchanged. The spot price for American exchange continued to ease by 0.0625 to 24 yuan 75. The spot price for Shanghai exchange continued to decrease by 1 yuan to 315 yuan.</p>
<p>The Situation in Tianjin Did Not Change Much</p>
<p>Tianjin, 25th: The market opened flat this morning. The spot prices for British and American exchange rates tightened slightly by 0.0625. The British exchange rate was 4 pence 3125, and the American exchange rate was 7 yuan 1875. The Shanghai exchange rate rose by half a yuan to 106.5 yuan. The informal market for "United Notes" was 2.5 yuan cheaper, at 98.5 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e57">Discount Rate Rose and Fell Only Slightly <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>The discount rate for yesterday's exchange drawing bills was consistently around 24 yuan per thousand yuan throughout the day. In the morning, it went from 24.25 yuan to a low of 23.75 yuan, and then rose back to 24 to 25 yuan near noon. In the afternoon, it was 24 yuan, a slight decrease of half a yuan compared to the previous day. The interest rate for money changers' associations was still listed at 2.5 yuan in both the morning and afternoon markets.</p>
<h3 id="e58">The Gold Market Deviated from Foreign Exchange <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>The informal market situation for yesterday's cash chiseled red was quite good, which was unexpected by ordinary operators. Although the foreign exchange market was in a state of easing and equilibrium, merchants from Hong Kong and other places had a surprisingly strong appetite, and a certain money changer was aggressively searching for goods in the later market. As a result, it ultimately rose by 12 yuan. The process on the same day initially rose slightly by 5 yuan, to 4,120 yuan, because the gold firm first bought, and another gold firm sold, which was diminished to 4,114 yuan. However, Hong Kong merchants suddenly frantically bought in, and the foreign exchange market reported softening, which caused retail investors to follow suit. Therefore, it once rose to 4,130 yuan. Subsequently, as the foreign exchange market turned hard, the silverware merchants competed to sell, and Hong Kong merchants had less appetite. Therefore, the noon closing was only called at 4,115 yuan. The afternoon situation was firm again, because a certain money changer was competing to accumulate, and as a result, it rose by 12 yuan, to a closing price of 4,127 yuan. The entire day's trading was still strong, at about 1,500 taels. The selling price of silverware jewelry was the same as before, and the customs gold and other items were still flat.</p>
<p>Chiseled Red Rose Back Up by 12 Yuan</p>
<p>Since this morning, a certain gold firm initially purchased on behalf of customers for each bar (ten taels), causing the opening to rise by 5 yuan. The silver store entered 20 taels, for 4,120 yuan. After the opening, another gold firm and money changers mutually sold, which fell back by 6 yuan. The gold firm exited the money exchange business for 10 taels, for 4,114 yuan. After this, a certain silverware store suddenly bought aggressively on behalf of Hong Kong merchants, and because the foreign exchange market was slightly soft, plus a certain securities firm also slightly followed suit, it soon rose by 17 yuan. The securities firm entered 10 taels of gold, for 4,130 yuan. Subsequently, the foreign exchange turned flat, and a certain silverware store and securities firm suddenly had a strong selling intention, and immediately returned low by 9 yuan. A certain silverware store exited the money exchange business for 10 taels, for 4,122 yuan, and at that time, Hong Kong merchants came back to buy, and again it rose by 7 yuan. The silverware store entered 30 taels for the securities firm, for 4,129 yuan. Then, as the Hong Kong merchants stopped buying, and the foreign exchange market suddenly reported hardening, the gold firms, silverware merchants, and money changers competed to sell forcefully, and the price could not be sustained, and it fell together by 4 yuan. The money changers mutually traded 20 taels, for 4,115 yuan as the noon closing price. The afternoon market situation was firm, and the opening immediately rose by 1 yuan. The silverware store entered 10 taels for the securities firm, for 4,116 yuan. Later, a certain second-rate money changer bought enthusiastically, mutually raising the price to search for goods, and the sellers' selling intention was particularly weak, rising steadily by 13 yuan. The money changers entered 20 taels for the Yu firm, for 4,129 yuan. At that time, the securities firm came forward to sell, and had previously returned small to 4,123 yuan. The money changers came back to pull in again, and again raised by 4 yuan. The money changers entered 20 taels for the gold firm, for 4,127 yuan, as the closing price for the evening. As a result, it rose by 12 yuan compared to the previous day, with a fluctuation of 17 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of the current gold firm's own brand gold, medal gold, etc. was several yuan higher than the chiseled red, and the buying price was reduced by 20 yuan. The current marked gold was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and transactions were rarely opened.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Remained Unchanged All Day</p>
<p>The selling price of jewelry gold per tael at the silverware stores remained unmoved all day. Datongxing was still listed at 415 yuan, and the new Tongxing was the same as the listed price, with the buying price reduced by about 15 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e59">American Gold Notes First Firm, Then Weak <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the supply and demand of foreign currencies, British and American gold pounds, were balanced, and the market price was stable. British gold notes were sluggish throughout the day, with no fluctuations. The evening market was still 47.5 yuan. The supply and demand of American gold notes was fickle, with slight twists and turns. The morning initially had very strong demand, and the market price was firm, having risen to 12.84 yuan. Subsequently, as the foreign exchange market eased back, the supply of American notes became more abundant, and fell to 12.74 yuan. As a result, the evening market was 12.78 yuan, unchanged from the previous day. The demand for Hong Kong notes continued to be strong, and the market price remained firm. The demand for French notes was rare, and the market situation was slightly soft. The supply and demand for Singapore, Dutch, and Annam notes, etc., was very rare, and the market prices were all unchanged. Siamese gold notes were slightly soft, and the evening market was 1.26 yuan. Korean notes were also weak, and the evening market was 1.05 yuan. Yesterday's market prices: Only Hong Kong notes were 31 yuan, French notes decreased by 2 yuan, and the other currencies were unchanged.</p>
<h3 id="e60">Securities: Domestic and Foreign Bonds Both Firm, Stock Trading Quiet <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Securities in the gray market remained firm yesterday, but trading failed to pick up, and morale did not improve. Too many rumors about the current situation dampened the spirits of bullish investors. Bearish investors saw no profit and also remained on the sidelines. However, Class D shares broke through the five-yuan mark. Yesterday morning, Xinfu Company moved from E to C, so the market prices of both Class C and E shares were the same. No. 35 was the main buyer of Class D shares, and the price gradually rose, breaking through the 50-yuan mark. Xie Da Lianyi and No. 16 also absorbed some, while Yongkang sold off slightly. Nos. 31 and 38 successively offered a considerable amount, keeping the market price stable. In the afternoon, No. 35 returned to buy Class D shares, but No. 28 continued to sell a lot of Class D shares, causing the market to weaken. Lianyi and No. 38 still had demand, while Renchang Runli and Lianhe were only selling, causing the market price to be briefly strong before weakening again. Overall, the bullish and bearish forces were evenly matched, showing a pattern of consolidation. The market price ultimately recovered by about one jiao (tenth of a yuan). The transaction volume was approximately 500,000 yuan. A simplified table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock trading: 100 shares of Zhabei Electric Power were traded at a price of 6.30 yuan.</p>
<p>Also, yesterday's stock market at the Public Industry Exchange was quiet and stable, with prices fluctuating narrowly. Rubber stocks remained in good demand, and there were no major developments for industrial stocks worthy of attention.</p>
<p>London, 24th—Today, the listed prices of British Far East companies' stocks trended upward again. Shanghai Tramways shares rose two shillings to fifteen shillings.

<h3 id="e62">Yarn and Cotton: Actual Sales Comparatively Active, Yarn Market Morale Slightly Boosted <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market is stable, with a tendency to remain in a state of consolidation. This is because the overseas cotton market is volatile, making it difficult to grasp. As for current yarn sales, although there is no significant development in Hong Kong, it is slightly more active compared to the past, which has boosted morale slightly. Generally, bulls are optimistic, but inventories are also high, and there are no extreme fluctuations in foreign exchange. Therefore, a hesitant, standstill situation is presented.</p>
<p>The opening price of current yarn in the morning showed a rebound in March cotton prices, which had plummeted the previous day, slightly restoring morale. However, with the foreign exchange rate stabilized and relaxed, buyers lacked enthusiasm. The opening price for 20-count Shuangma yarn was 737 yuan. After this opening, there were no significant changes, with a slight drop of one and a half yuan. The closing price remained at 736 yuan, creating a stalemate in the market. According to half-day transaction statistics, 1,445 bales were traded. The price of 20-count Shuangma yarn rose by one yuan, while the rest remained about the same as the previous day. Today, 316 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong. The purchase volume of each group is listed as follows:</p>

<p>Local cotton trading remains flat, but the trend is still upward. This is because American cotton has rebounded again, boosting morale slightly. However, factory demand has not been particularly strong. Only Defeng Factory purchased 500 bales of Tonghua cotton. There were no other transactions. The market remains bullish. The supply of Tonghua cotton from northern Jiangsu totaled 2,164 bales. The current cotton transaction situation is listed on the left.</p>
<p>In other news, regarding the foreign cotton market price: In the New York cotton market, the situation turned firm again yesterday morning. Initially, speculative buying and selling triggered buying by other firms, causing prices to surge by more than ten points. Later, aggressive short covering caused the market to turn firm, with closing prices more than thirty points higher for near-term contracts and more than forty points higher for distant contracts compared to the previous day. Indian cotton, including forecasts, rose over a rupee, Egyptian cotton rose over ten points, and Liverpool cotton rose over ten pence.</p>
<p>In the Shanghai foreign cotton market, the situation has been very dull recently. The decline in overseas cotton prices in the past few days has made morale quite weak. Yesterday's rise in the cotton market also improved morale somewhat, but trading remained sluggish. It is expected that there is no hope for a turnaround within the next few days as the end of the year approaches. Factory trading is extremely quiet. The ex-factory price of yesterday's cotton, converted at a US dollar exchange rate of 7.75 yuan, is as follows:</p>

<p>Hardware trading is seeing reduced demand as the end of the lunar year approaches. Yesterday, only a hot water bottle factory and an iron factory purchased over a hundred boxes of pig iron at a price of 78 yuan. Original bundles of one thousand pounds of steel are selling for around 800 yuan. Since the Hakka merchants stopped handling galvanized iron (i.e., tinplate), business relies solely on a few local factories. It is reported that recent sales have been quite strong, so the market is also good. Standard prices remain firm. For example, Italian goods of 180 pounds are selling for 180 yuan per box, American goods of 180 pounds are selling for 185 yuan, and prime-grade goods of 200 pounds are selling for 205 yuan. Yesterday's trading volume reached about seventy or eighty boxes.</p>

<p>After the Japanese troops secretly crossed the Qiantang River and landed at Kanshan in Xiaoshan, the Third War Zone Command dispatched a large force to block them. Frontline troops have been encircled and are being annihilated. The battle remains fierce. The Japanese troops who crossed the river are faltering and will soon be wiped out. Yuyao and Ningbo remain peaceful. Shipping between Shanghai and Ningbo is smooth. Detailed information is as follows:</p>
<p>The South Bank of the Qiantang River Will Soon Be Cleared</p>
<p>After the Japanese troops secretly crossed the Qiantang River and landed, they split into two routes to invade Xiaoshan and Shaoxing. After large units of Chinese troops rushed to block them, the battle became very fierce. The vanguard of the Japanese troops on the eastern route has been encircled and annihilated by Chinese troops at Linpu Station in Xiaoshan County. The Japanese troops on the western route have been blocked at Qiaoqiao in Shaoxing County. The purpose of the Japanese troops was to cut off the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway and invade Zhuji and Jinhua. Now, these Japanese troops have been blocked at Wenjiayan in Xiaoshan County. The other route was to cut off the Yongjin Highway, invade Shaoxing, and threaten Ningbo. However, the Japanese troops were surrounded and blocked by Chinese troops at Qianqingzhen, west of Qiaoqiao. It is reported that Chinese troops recovered Yiqiao on the 24th. The Japanese troops who landed are faltering and have fled back to the banks of the Xiaoshan River. The Japanese troops who fled to Anchang have also been completely wiped out. Yesterday, a reporter from the New Voice Agency learned from relevant sources that rumors of the fall of Shaoxing and a large fire in Ningbo have been proven to be absolutely false. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, a telegram arrived in Shanghai from Ningbo, reporting, "Ningbo is peaceful, morale is calm, and the situation in Xiaoshan is improving," which proves that the rumors of a large fire in Ningbo are inaccurate. A telegram also arrived in Shanghai from Shaoxing, stating, "The people of Shaoxing City are panicked, and residents are relocating," which proves that the rumors of the fall of Shaoxing are inaccurate. As for the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications in Shaoxing, although they have prepared everything, they have not withdrawn as of last night.</p>
<p>Zhenhai Is Under Martial Law; Shipping Continues as Usual</p>
<p>Shipping between Shanghai and Zhenhai continues as usual. The Dabu Wheel, operated by the Norwegian China Steam Navigation Co., telegraphed Shanghai yesterday, reporting that it left Zhenhai at 4:00 PM yesterday and is expected to arrive in Shanghai this morning. The Deping Wheel, operated by the Italian China-Italy Company, is scheduled to leave Zhenhai for Shanghai today. There are still four foreign ships berthed in Zhenhai: Moufu, Haifu, Shenglilai, and Haida. Also, the highway from Ningbo to Jinhua has been closed to passenger and freight vehicles due to military reasons. Therefore, the Zhejiang-Jiangxi customer groups stationed in Shanghai have stopped shipping goods and are rushing to transport the local goods滞甬 that have been detained in Ningbo. Yesterday, it was learned from the shipping industry that since the Japanese troops secretly crossed the Qiantang River and landed in Xiaoshan, the Ningbo Defense Commander and the Wenzhou-Taizhou Defense Commander have been ordered by General Liu, Commander of the Tenth Army Group, to be especially vigilant along the coast and to conduct strict inspections of passengers entering and leaving. All ports are closed to ships at night, and large units of troops have been deployed to garrison and construct solid defensive works to prevent the Japanese troops from taking the opportunity to invade eastern Zhejiang. All highways along the coast have been ordered to be completely destroyed, and the county towns are taking measures to evacuate the population.</p>
<h3 id="e68">The Four Banks Headquarters Cut off Japanese Forgery of Legal Tender; Old Notes Kept in Stock and Issued in Lost Areas and Nearby; Negotiate with Foreign Note Companies Regarding Forgery Institutions <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>The Joint Office of the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank is working to cut off the Japanese forgery of Chinese legal tender in order to disrupt finances, and has formulated nine countermeasures: (1) The four banks will find ways to prevent the transfer of new legal tender into the lost areas, and in branches close to the lost areas,</p>
<p>Keep More Old Notes in Stock</p>
<p>Issue them, so that all those circulating in the lost areas are old notes, so that the new forged notes made by the Japanese are not easy to confuse with the real thing. (2) The Ministry of Finance should issue a general order to all customs checkpoints to strictly inspect the forged notes printed by the Japanese, and absolutely prevent them from entering the areas that have not been lost, so that the affected areas will not spread. (3) The Ministry of Finance should notify the provinces to instruct their subordinates to pay special attention to prevention, and ensure that the forged notes made by the Japanese within their borders are not allowed to remain. (4) The four banks should selectively send various sample notes to the county governments close to the lost areas, and ask them to post them for public display, so that when the people discover forged notes, they can verify them nearby and not be deceived. (5) The four banks should publicize the differences between genuine and forged notes, and clearly list the harms of using forged notes, print publicity materials, and carry out various publicity methods by the central propaganda agencies or the political departments of the military commissions stationed near the lost areas at the same time, so that the people can follow them and refuse to use them. (6) Whenever information is received that the Japanese are forging legal tender, printing, transporting, etc., it should be</p>
<p>International Propaganda</p>
<p>The scheme should be vigorously publicized to all friendly countries by the agencies. If the serial numbers and amounts of the forged notes are known, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs should formally declare to all friendly countries that China cannot recognize the forged notes, so that the abnormal ugly state of the Japanese will be fully exposed to the world. (7) If there are forgery institutions in the lost areas, because our military and police power cannot reach them, foreign banknote companies that print banknotes should be entrusted to negotiate. The Japanese manufacture of forged notes is to destroy credit for the banks, to disrupt finances for the country, and to infringe legal interests for the banknote printing companies. From a legal point of view, the banknote company has the right to come forward and negotiate. (8) Regardless of the location, if anyone is found to be storing, transporting, or using forged legal tender for the Japanese side, or is colluding with the Japanese side to use it, or is forging legal tender or collecting it, after investigation or reporting is verified, the second article of the revised Provisional Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors should be followed according to the circumstances of the crime. According to the provisions of Article 10, or Article 4 of the revised Provisional Regulations for the Punishment of Those Who Hinder the National Currency, the punishment shall be severe. The agency that investigates or the person who reports, after the case is closed, shall be rewarded handsomely according to the case and the amount of forged legal tender seized, according to the example of awarding rewards for destroying forged banknotes by the issuing banks. If the person is falsely accused for no reason, the original trial agency shall investigate and deal with it strictly in accordance with the Criminal Law. (9) The legal tender of the four banks currently circulating in the market is</p>
<p>Many Types</p>
<p>Because it is difficult for the people to identify, it is easy to mix and use forged notes. Therefore, to deal with the Japanese forgery of legal tender, unifying the banknote format is the fundamental solution. The four banks should select the best one from the existing various formats as the standard, and gradually withdraw other miscellaneous versions. In the future, it will be stipulated that each bank shall not use two types of formats at the same time, so as to unify the currency and resist forgery.</p>

<h3 id="e72">The French Tram Company's Salary Increase Issue Resolved; Each Worker Can Receive More Than 43 Yuan in Salary; The Work Stoppage Lasted Only Eight Hours and Ended Satisfactorily <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>All the workers of the French Tram Company felt that the cost of living had risen sharply, and all companies and major stores had automatically proposed salary increases, but the company authorities had not made any indication regarding the workers' salaries. Therefore, at 7:30 AM on the 24th, all the workers, including drivers and ticket sellers, totaling more than 700 people, went on strike. They elected representatives to visit the manager, Mr. Fafort, to request an increase in rice subsidies and wages, which lasted for eight hours. The workers' representatives stated that they would not resume work until a satisfactory reply was received, requesting an increase of two months' salary for the year-end bonus and a 20% increase in wages based on salary. It is reported that the French Tram Company had previously increased salaries by 3 yuan per person in August last year, and the rice subsidy had also increased from 4.5 yuan to 7.5 yuan. According to reporters' inquiries with the company, the labor dispute has been resolved. Each person has been given a universal salary increase of 3 yuan, and the rice subsidy has been increased by 4.5 yuan. For example, the lowest salary for each driver was originally 0.65 yuan in wages, 0.35 yuan in meal subsidy, and 0.20 yuan per day in compensation, with a monthly salary of about 36 yuan. After the salary increase, each worker will receive about 43.50 yuan per month. The workers were satisfied and resumed work at 2:15 PM that afternoon.</p>
<p>Business as Usual</p>
<p>The mainland newspaper reported that more than 700 workers of the Shanghai French Tram and Power Company went on strike from 7:00 AM yesterday (the 24th). Later, the company's general manager, Mr. Frett, guaranteed that the workers' demands would be considered and replied to the next day. The workers resumed work at 3:00 PM in the afternoon. During these eight hours of strike time, the tram and power plants in the French Concession did not stop working. The tram drivers and ticket sellers continued to work all day, and when the Chinese staff of the power plant went on strike, the European staff勉予勉力 maintained it.</p>
<p>Long in the Works</p>
<p>It has been brewing for months that the company workers are dissatisfied and strike. At the end of last year, the workers requested a year-end bonus of two months' salary and a 12% salary increase, but the company considered this request unreasonable and rejected it. They did not allow the workers' recent request, but expressed willingness to increase the workers' monthly rice subsidy from 7.5 yuan to 12 yuan.</p>
<p>Involved in the Tu Case</p>
<p>The workers still felt a little uneasy about this, which led to yesterday's strike. The intermediary was Mr. Tu Jingshan, the company's comprador. His younger brother, Tu Kunshan, was assassinated on Melrose Avenue on the 3rd of this month, and was shot in the arm and leg. The police believe that the murderer actually intended to assassinate Tu Jingshan, but mistakenly stabbed his younger brother. It is heard that the attempted assassination case was politically motivated, and that a certain party intended to use this to incite labor disputes in the Shanghai French Tram and Power Company.</p>
<h3 id="e73">Rickshaw Rental Increase Approved; Fares Also Increased <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Rickshaw Industry Association had twice submitted applications to the工部局 (Municipal Council) in May and June of last year to allow the owners to increase rickshaw rentals, but both were rejected. Now, the association has re-submitted a petition to the Bureau, detailing the huge expenses of the rickshaw industry and the</p>
<p>Prices of hardware components for rickshaws soaring, making business difficult, and mentioning that public buses, trams, and other public utilities have been approved to increase prices, requesting permission to increase rickshaw rentals by 30%. The Municipal Council's Public Utilities Committee met on the 15th of this month and discussed the case, and carefully reviewed the association's operating expenses. The commissioners all said that the cost of new cars</p>
<p>The cost per car has risen from 100 yuan to 145 yuan, and the owners' claim that expenses have increased is indeed the case. Allowing them to increase car rentals to increase income and maintain the vehicles in good condition within their financial capacity to satisfy passengers is desirable. Moreover, at a time when copper coins are extinct, passengers are switching to角币 (dime) to pay fares, which benefits the rickshaw pullers. Based on the above, it was decided that,</p>
<p>From February 1st, rickshaw rentals will be increased from 7.70 角 per day to 8.30 角 (an increase of approximately 8%). At the same time, the minimum number of fares, calculated by distance, will be increased from 8 角 to 1 角 per half mile, and calculated by time, will be increased from 5 角 to 6 角 per hour. Also, regarding cracking down on owners overcharging rentals, the Committee believes that the current Police Department is only retaining rickshaw licenses, which is not a</p>
<p>Thorough solution. After this decision to approve the increase in rentals, strict measures must be taken to crack down on overcharging. The Bureau should be asked to grant the Police Department the power to revoke rickshaw licenses, and drivers should be made aware of this measure as much as possible to encourage them to report cases for verification. The suggestions were approved by the Municipal Council Board of Directors on the 24th of this month.</p>

<h3 id="e76">After the Opening of the Iron Gates in the French Concession, It is Not Crowded; Cars Are Allowed to Pass Through the Iron Gates on Xinqiao Street <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Since the four iron gates in the French Concession connecting to the Nanshi area, namely the斜桥 (Xie Bridge), 南阳桥 (Nanyang Bridge), 新桥街 (Xinqiao Street), and 典当街 (Diandang Street), were opened from the day before yesterday, yesterday was the second day after the opening. The residents entering and leaving the four locations are not very crowded. This is because the situation in the Nanshi area is currently depressed, and there are very few residents. Those who enter and leave the area these days are mostly going to visit their former residences after the劫 (robbery).</p>
<p>Strict Inspection</p>
<p>In order to maintain good order, the French Concession police have dispatched many French-Chinese-Vietnamese detectives. Each iron gate is divided into two entrances, one for entering and one for exiting. Residents entering the concession from Nanshi are subject to strict inspection by police officers. Women are also selectively inspected by female inspectors if they are suspected. Because there is not a lot of entry and exit, the order is still quite good.</p>
<p>Vehicles Pass Through</p>
<p>As for vehicles, currently only the iron gate on Xinqiao Street opposite the Tongren Fuyuantang allows cars to pass through. The remaining gates are still closed to vehicles. At the gap in the 新开河 (Xinkai River) cordon, in addition to cars being able to enter and exit freely, free cars can also pass through, but they must get off and walk across to be allowed to pass.</p>
<h3 id="e77">Rampant Crime in the Badlands: Gambling Dens, Opium Dens, and Flower Associations Flourish, Leading to Assassinations and Kidnappings <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>The *North-China Daily News* reports that gambling dens, opium dens, and flower association organizations are flourishing in the "badlands" of western Shanghai as never before. Assassinations, kidnappings, embezzlement, and other crimes arise as a result. These criminal venues all hold licenses issued by the authorities outside the Settlement, who profit handsomely by issuing permits and providing "protection." Today, in the Western District, from magnificent buildings to dark and squalid alleys, there are more than twenty large and small gambling establishments. All of them obtain licenses from a management office in Lane 470, Yu Yuan Road, run by a certain Japanese national. They must pay daily protection fees ranging from 150 to 1,000 yuan. Flower associations are also very harmful. Many people, due to gambling debts from flower associations, resort to desperate measures or commit suicide in despair. There are approximately two hundred flower association organizations, managed by a central office. They pay a daily protection fee of 350 yuan to the "badlands" authorities in Lane 470, Yu Yuan Road. The opium business is flourishing alongside gambling dens and dance halls, as gambling dens all have opium rooms for customers to smoke. It is estimated that there are about one hundred opium dens attached to gambling dens or operating independently. In addition, there are many opium paste shops, all of which need to pay business fees. However, the amounts are not as large as those paid by the gambling establishments; what they pay is a huge sum. It is heard that opium dens pay a monthly fee of 100 to 150 yuan to a management office headed by a certain Japanese national within the West District Japanese Gendarmerie Headquarters at 94 Jessfield Road. Heroin is clearly discriminated against in the "badlands" area. The "Municipal Police" recently raided and shut down several heroin dens.</p>
<h3 id="e78">Rumor That Zhabei Is About to Open Breaches <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>In order to control the vegetable business in this city, the Japanese side has specially converted the Continental Bank warehouse and the Sihang Warehouse buildings on the eastern end of Guangfu Road in Zhabei into the "Shanghai Central Municipal Market." They have also forcibly seized civilian land behind the warehouse to build a market. To attract vegetable merchants, peddlers, travelers, and others to buy and sell, the Japanese side is simultaneously opening two breaches. One is north of the vegetable market, directly across from the intersection of Avenue des Sœurs Blanches in the Settlement; the other is south of the vegetable market, behind the Continental Bank warehouse. The sidewalk along North Tibet Road at that location will be widened. On the west side, along Manchuria Road in the Chinese area, two breaches will also be opened, specifically for merchants and peddlers from various places in the Zhabei interior, such as Wusong, Jiangwan, Dachang, Luodian, Nanxiang, and Zhenru, who have family repatriation permits to enter and exit.</p>
<h3 id="e79">The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Wharf at Yangjiadu Is Coveted Again; The Japanese Toa Kaiun Kaisha Attempts to Control Shipping on the Southern Huangpu River <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>The Toa Kaiun Kaisha (East Asia Shipping Co., Ltd.), formed by the merger of the three major Japanese shipping companies, is now actively seeking to restore shipping on the southern Huangpu River above the Sixteenth Pier blockade line. At the old Pootung Wharf, there used to be warehouses and wharves belonging to the Japanese Nisshin Kisen and Osaka Shosen Kaisha. Some were destroyed by fire during the war. Personnel have been dispatched to take over the above-mentioned two warehouses and wharves. However, because the old Pootung Wharf along the riverbank has been designated as a security zone, it is inconvenient for workers to enter and exit. Therefore, Toa Kaiun Kaisha is currently negotiating with the Japanese garrison to open the old Pootung Wharf security line to facilitate worker access. In addition to the Nisshin Kisen and Osaka Shosen wharves, the new China Merchants Steam Navigation Company wharf at Yangjiadu in Pootung, which was formerly owned by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, is also intended to be taken over, with plans to restore the wharf business and put it under the management of Toa Kaiun Kaisha. Therefore, the shipping rights of the southern Huangpu River are likely to fall completely into Japanese hands.</p>

<p>Recognizing that underground gasoline tanks and fixed gasoline pumps are often inconvenient to use, and that various iron drums, iron cans, and other containers for storing gasoline are prone to danger, the Shanghai Municipal Council has decided to allow the installation of mobile gasoline tanks and pumps with wheels. However, the maximum capacity of each tank must not exceed sixty gallons. Regarding this installation, the Municipal Council has established the following regulations: "Any mobile gasoline tank with wheels containing flammable liquids, if placed indoors, must not exceed sixty gallons in capacity. The tank must be made of iron or steel at least three-sixteenths of an inch thick. All tank openings must be at the top and fitted with a lid (preferably made of non-corrosive wire mesh, forty inches long and forty inches wide, or of a similar material, but at least thirty inches long and thirty inches wide). The tank wheels must have rubber tires. The tank body must be properly secured to prevent overturning during normal use. When extracting liquid from the tank, a securely fitted pump must be used."</p>
<p>Furthermore, these tanks are not allowed to be placed on sidewalks, roads, or public streets to prevent damage by vehicles and the risk of fire.</p>

<p>Last winter, the Philippine government planned to restrict retail trade, and the Manila Municipal Council passed a law stipulating that "only Filipino and American citizens have the right to engage in any business in the Manila public markets." Since most Chinese in the islands are engaged in retail trade, the implementation of this law would have greatly affected the Chinese community in the Philippines. The Chinese government specially instructed Consul General Yang Guang-sheng in the Philippines to lodge a protest with the Philippine government based on the Sino-American commercial treaty of 1880. After Consul General Yang's repeated consultations with Mr. Cellis, the U.S. Commercial Commissioner to the Philippines, and Philippine President Quezon, the implementation of the law was temporarily suspended, pending further discussion between the Philippine government and the U.S. State Department.</p>

<p>Xiao Shou-pei, thirty-seven years old, from Wuxi, the owner of the Heli Foundry at No. 9-5, Nancaojiazhai, Bailinan Road, Western Shanghai, was kidnapped by four bandits at around 6:00 AM yesterday morning. The bandits pulled out box cannons, forced Xiao to board a car that was waiting there, and drove quickly westward. Afterwards, a reporter from China News Agency questioned Xiao's wife, who said that her husband had not received any threatening letters beforehand. However, on the evening of the 11th of this month, at a banquet hosted by a certain Mr. Zhu, the owner of a gambling den, someone suddenly said that his wife might encounter misfortune within days. Xiao did not take it to heart at the time, so he did not investigate. This sudden kidnapping makes it difficult to understand the truth.</p>

<p>Jin Ding Qi Incense and Candle Shop at No. 315 Avenue Edward VII, and its branch at No. 2, Lane 1243, Yu Yuan Road, are both owned by Ma Shang-xian. Yan De-qing, a twenty-one-year-old local man, was employed as an accountant at the Yu Yuan Road branch. However, Yan's character was poor. In addition to having bad habits, he was fond of gambling, leading him to embezzle 63 yuan from the accounts. Ma Shang-xian discovered this and dismissed Yan in November of last year. Unexpectedly, on February 24th, Ma received a phone call from Yan, accusing Ma of sodomizing him and infecting his anus with syphilis. Now that he had been abandoned, he demanded compensation of 500 yuan in legal tender. On December 28th, Ma received an invitation to a Sichuan restaurant, inviting Ma to meet at Fengdu Hall on the 31st. The signatory was [unclear name, sounds like "Yan Za Wang"]. Ma knew that these malicious acts were all committed by Yan and did not take them seriously. He reported the information to the Xinzha Police Station. Recently, in addition to constantly receiving threatening phone calls, Ma also received a letter from attorney Yuan Xizui representing Yan De-qing, reiterating that Ma had committed sodomy, which is prohibited by law, and demanding compensation of 500 yuan. Ma also hired attorney Shen to send a letter in response. Until the day before yesterday, Yan De-qing's father, Yan Geng-shan, invited Ma to a tea house at No. 247, Baike Road, to negotiate. Ma secretly reported this to the police station and, while negotiating with Yan, first handed over 100 yuan. The detectives then arrested the Yan father and son and took them to the police station. Because Yan De-qing continued to claim that Ma had sodomized him and that his anus was infected, the police sent him to the Shanghai Municipal Council Hospital. An examination revealed that there were no unusual conditions in Yan's anus and no signs of syphilis. He was ordered to be detained. Yesterday morning, police station lawyer Zhang Tianyin was sent to the First Special District Court to prosecute him on charges of extortion and intimidation, and presented the case, requesting a postponement of the hearing. After presiding judge questioned him once, Yan Geng-shan was ordered to post bail of 100 yuan, and Yan De-qing was detained. The hearing was postponed for seven days for further investigation.</p>

<p>Zhu Fei-jun, a well-known Chinese medicine practitioner from Jiaxing, fifty-one years old, fled to Shanghai with his wife and concubine, Zhu Lu-shi, in March of last year due to the fall of Jiaxing. He set up a clinic at No. 3, Fuming Village, Avenue Foch, in the French Concession. His wife lived in the clinic, while his concubine, Lu-shi, rented a room at No. 7, Shanqingfang, Huanlong Road. However, Zhu Lu-shi, thirty-six years old this year, was of poor character and often hung up phone calls from outside to the husband of her co-tenant, Madam Liu Zhang, a native of Ningbo. The telephone was installed by the sub-landlord and was for the common use of the tenants. Because Zhu Lu-shi repeatedly hung up phone calls to the Liu family, they quarreled on December 30th of last year. The next morning, Madam Liu Zhang went to the drying platform to dry diapers. Zhu Lu-shi first verbally abused Zhang, and then joined her husband, Zhu Fei-jun, and her younger brother, Lu Yong-jun, in assaulting her. Liu Zhang's younger sister, Zhang Man-ying, twenty-six years old, who recently arrived in Shanghai from Ningbo seeking marriage, rushed to mediate. However, she was also beaten by Zhu and his family, causing serious injuries and coughing up blood. Therefore, Zhang Man-ying hired attorney Wang Shou-an to represent her and submitted a complaint to the First Special District Court Prosecutor's Office, requesting verification of the injuries and filing a private prosecution against Zhu Fei-jun, Zhu Lu-shi, and Lu Yong-jun (twenty-four years old, from Jiaxing, working at the Taiji Sawmill at No. 76, Wuding Road) for assault, requesting that they be investigated and dealt with according to the law. Upon receiving the complaint, the court, presided over by Judge Zhu Chu-zhe, held a hearing yesterday morning. The plaintiff, Zhang Man-ying, was helped to the court by her mother and accompanied by her attorney, describing the assault and injuries. The defendants also appeared with their defense attorneys, absolutely denying that they injured the plaintiff. The court ruled that the case required the summoning of witnesses for investigation and announced a postponement for further questioning. The defendants were each required to post substantial bail. If they could not provide bail, they would be detained. The defendants' defense attorneys requested temporary release on bond, but the court refused.

<p>— Representative of Moral Rearmament from Burma</p>
<p>Ms. Ma Ningtai, the representative from Burma to the Second World Assembly for Moral Rearmament, stopped in Shanghai for a short stay on her way back to her country. Her lectures and participation in Moral Rearmament gatherings have been warmly welcomed by all circles. This reporter visited her at the Museum Road Hotel yesterday. The lady wore Burmese clothing, her hair in a high bun, and she wore silver glasses. Her demeanor was striking. When asked about the progress of Moral Rearmament in Burma, the lady said: Burma is a country with a complex ethnicity, and there are also many religious sects. Within the country, there are often conflicts between the Burmese and Indian ethnic groups, or between Islam and Hinduism, due to economic interests. Every year on National Day, various ethnic groups or religions gather crowds and parade in lines. Often, due to emotional impulses, fights break out, and the shop windows in various towns are destroyed, and even the electric lights go out. The hostility is so deep that it is filled with hatred, jealousy, and selfishness. Since the implementation of Moral Rearmament, the situation has changed significantly. In March of last year, a Moral Rearmament Movement conference was held at the Yangon City Hall. Leaders from various ethnic groups and religions gathered in one hall, sincerely communicated with each other. Not only was the past争争 of emotions eliminated, but even mutual apologies were made, expressing that we will hold hands to work together, share new responsibilities. The influence affected, in institutions, bodies, schools, to be able to show tolerance and understanding, reaching harmony. Therefore, on National Day in December of last year, although the crowds gathered and paraded as usual, the order was orderly, and there were no previous unfortunate events. From this, it can be known that the promotion of Moral Rearmament is truly creating true happiness for mankind. Then the reporter asked about the meaning and promotion method of the Moral Rearmament Movement. The lady said: Moral Rearmament has four standards of living, namely, absolute honesty, absolute purity, absolute unselfishness, and absolute love. If everyone can implement it, then disputes between people, families, groups, and countries will cease. We should not always point fingers at others; we should first examine ourselves to see if what we say and do violates the standards of absolute honesty, absolute purity, absolute unselfishness, and absolute love. If we can deeply examine ourselves, then we will realize that there are many things that are not right and need to be corrected. Therefore, the promotion of Moral Rearmament focuses on personal practice and attention to self-examination. It is heard that after leaving Shanghai, the lady will visit various places in mainland China, such as Kunming and Chongqing. The date of departure from Shanghai is at the end of this month.</p>

Therefore, according to the astronomical observatory's observations, the atmosphere is expected to warm up slightly in the coming days. The weather across the country is extremely stable. The continuation of clear and refreshing weather in Shanghai is inevitable. Furthermore, the various infectious diseases in this city have greatly decreased recently, but the air still feels dry, and diphtheria is still prevalent.</p>

<h3 id="e100">Discussing My Brothers' Profound Affection: Serving Together for Over Twenty Years <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>— Buddha</p>
<p>At that time, my brother and I had been working together for four or five years. I fell ill with neurasthenia and returned home to recuperate. During the Xinhai Revolution, the imperial system was overthrown, and the *Shen Bao* also changed management, from Manager Xi to Manager Liangcai. In the first year of the Republic, I served as editor of the *Jiangsu Provincial Gazette*. When the Second Revolution broke out, I left. I then joined the *Xinwen Bao* for over a year, but resigned simultaneously with Wu Shuzi and Zhou Mengxiong when Yuan Shikai proclaimed himself emperor. Later, I taught at Pudong Middle School and Shanghai University for five or six years until my old illness relapsed, nearly taking my life. According to the doctors, if I continued to work as a teacher, I would surely die. So, I resigned from my teaching position at Shanghai University. I was away from the *Shen Bao* for ten years. During these ten years, my brother and I rarely met because we each had our own duties and could not see each other often.</p>
<p>The editing life essentially embodies the eight characters of "unrestrained diet and irregular hours." However, the most empty and boring time of day was from one or two o'clock to four or five o'clock in the afternoon. Since neither of us liked gambling nor had other hobbies, we felt extremely dull. Therefore, every afternoon, my brother would always accompany Zhou Mengxiong and me to Tong Yu Chun or Yi Le Tian to sip tea for two or three hours. If I happened to be busy elsewhere, my brother would be like a bird that had lost its flock, feeling unhappy. My brother would not leave the office until five or six o'clock every afternoon. Besides having dinner, he would not go upstairs to sleep until four or five o'clock the next morning. In summer, the sky would already be bright. My brother was consistent in his work and never negligent, always the same for decades. My brother treated the newspaper office as his home, but did not pay much attention to family matters. According to the old custom of the newspaper, it was closed for only seven days during the winter vacation. Therefore, my brother would not return home until the 28th or 29th day of the twelfth lunar month. On New Year's Day, my brother would come to my place for dinner, or I would go to my brother's place for dinner. Sometimes we would play games like catching sparrows, and the next day we would do the opposite. This was a common practice. On the first day of the new year, he had to go to the office. Therefore, these four or five days were the happiest time for us to enjoy family happiness.</p>
<p>In the spring of the twentieth year of the Republic, my old illness recurred seriously, so I entered Tongde Hospital on Tongfu Road for surgery, staying in the hospital for about two months. My brother would visit me in the hospital once every afternoon without fail. He would ask about my diet and wound, showing great care. I told him that he was old and did not need to come every day, but my brother would always say, "I have nothing to do anyway, so I'll just take a walk." After I recovered, Manager Liangcai, considering my condition after the illness, could not bear to have me work through the night, so he transferred me to be in charge of the local supplement. Manager Liangcai was truly considerate to me in every way. From then on, our working hours were different, so we had less time to see each other. In the summer of the twenty-second year of the Republic, Mr. Chen Leng resigned due to certain matters. In the autumn of the twenty-third year of the Republic, Manager Liangcai met with misfortune at Wengjiabu in Haining. All the heavy responsibilities of the newspaper office fell on my elder brother alone, and coping with the environment was extremely difficult. My brother worked diligently, exhausting both his mind and body, and in the spring of the twenty-fourth year of the Republic, he suffered a stroke. He stayed in the hospital for several months and returned to Songjiang to recuperate. I would visit him once every four or five days. My brother would ask me about national affairs and the affairs of the newspaper office in great detail. When the August 13th Incident occurred, bombs frequently exploded in Songjiang, and the people of Songjiang had different views on whether to evacuate to Shanghai or the countryside. Some people advised my brother to come to Shanghai, but my brother said, "I will decide based on what my younger brother says." When I heard this, I hired a car to pick him up and bring him to Shanghai. When the weather was calm and sunny in his Shanghai residence, he would hire a car to my residence to talk. I would also visit him every two or three days. If I did not visit him for several days, he would ask his daughter, "Has Uncle come? Why haven't I seen him for these few days?" When he saw me arrive, he would be very happy and chat about trivial matters because I did not want to talk to my brother about national affairs or the affairs of the newspaper office, fearing it would hurt his heart. If he saw me get up to leave, he would always say, "It's still early, let's talk a little longer," as if reluctant to part for even a moment. Alas! If I had known this would happen, how could I have borne to leave my brother? On his deathbed, my brother instructed his family to telegraph his younger brother immediately upon his death. Alas, when my brother was critically ill, I was unable to go due to other matters and only went after his death. How can I be forgiven for my fault?</p>
<p>My brother and I worked together for a total of twenty-seven or eight years. Although our views sometimes differed, we never had even half a word of disagreement. Therefore, our affection for each other grew stronger with age. Alas! How can I still work with my brother now? How can I even see my brother's face and talk to him again? Although I am also old, I fear it will not be long before I follow my brother to the afterlife. Although my brother has left me now, will there not be a day when my brother and I will be reunited? (The End)</p>

<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 20: World Transportation, Common Language; Children's Education, Rewarding Talent</p>
<p>In Western weddings, they often have dance parties and such. According to Mrs. Sulia's idea, it would be best to have some excitement. But Jin Danyun said, "We should still follow Eastern customs. Why must we imitate everything from foreign countries? Although those *bons vivants* all like to dance, those of us who have studied in Europe and America can also dance. But those social dances, our Chinese middle-aged people may not all know them, especially the middle-aged ladies. Therefore, if we have a dance party, there will be many people who are left out." Many Chinese friends wanted to pool their money to present a theatrical performance, but Jin Danyun declined them all. As for miscellaneous humorous performances, they could amuse the guests, but at this moment, they felt somewhat low-grade. Today, in the dining hall of the International Hotel, the guests were like clouds, men and women mingling, with more than three hundred people seated. The bride and groom sat at the head table in the center, and everyone else sat according to their name cards. The Western food was the best here, but the price could not be too expensive. The wine was both wine and the Chinese traditional Shaoxing yellow wine. Because China has many places growing grapes recently, and the art of wine making is well-known by Chinese brewers. Does not Chinese Tang poetry have the line of "Grape wine, luminous cups at night"? China is not a prohibition country, so wine can be drunk freely. Moreover, drinking celebrates happiness, so when drinking wedding wine, of course, the host cannot skimp on the wine. However, China still adheres to the ancient saying "Drink in moderation, avoid chaos." Health authorities in various places do not allow the sale of wine to drunkards, and there are restrictions on shops that sell wine. Now, let me talk about the six young ladies from Suzhou who came to the wedding. They were originally sitting together. When the banquet was about to end, Wu Junke proposed, "Why don't we go to Danyun's house to play? Are you happy to go? If you are happy, we six will go together." Everyone was naturally happy to go. Zhu Airen said, "But the bride and groom have not gone back yet, and we are going there first. I'm afraid there is no one at her house, everyone is here eating wedding wine. There will be no one to entertain us at her house." Shao Huihua said, "There will definitely be someone to entertain us. They will be back in a moment. Even if there is no one to entertain us, we can entertain each other. In a moment, when they come back, I'm afraid there will be many yellow-haired, green-eyed people following them. Let's go and occupy her bridal chamber first. Let's eat her wedding fruits and sweets. We can be the first to arrive." Among these six young ladies, Zhu Airen was the oldest, Wu Junke was the youngest, and Wu Junsu and Shao Huihua were the most mischievous. (232)</p>
<h3 id="e102">Anecdotes of Yu Hua <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Yizhi, sent from the Netherlands</p>
<p>On November 13th of the twenty-eighth year of the Republic, Du Hua, styled Manto, originally named Qingyun, the criminal court president of the Second Branch of the Higher Court, died for his duty because of the Zhaofa Letter. Before he went abroad to study, he was the best among my old classmates. Yu was quick-witted and had an exceptionally strong memory. His works were especially creative. He did not often take notes in class, and during breaks, those who sought his advice would follow him and listen attentively without getting tired. His daily knowledge was as rich as an encyclopedia. Every year at the final exam, when he needed to prepare answering materials, he would temporarily sit down at a classmate's desk and borrow them. When he read a book, he would quickly flip the pages back and forth. After finishing the book, he could silently write out the essentials, having a glimpse like reading ten lines at a glance. Therefore, at a young age, he had already read the Thirteen Classics and the Twenty-Four Histories, which was something that other classmates could not match. Sometimes, when he was in the mood, he was good at painting with ink, expressing both the surface and the inner truth, and decorating everything perfectly. One year, during the physics exam, Yu did not prepare in advance and could not answer in detail. He suddenly had an unusual idea and drew all the experimental instruments in the classroom on the exam paper, adding slight explanations. With a small effort, he exceeded and was more exquisite than those who wrote the answers blankly. The teacher was delighted to read the paper and still ranked him high. Before the early years of the Republic, Jiang Xunru from Tangxi, Zhejiang, who headed the Jiaxing Higher Reviewing Court, followed the style of Yuyang in poetry. When leaving the school, he composed a farewell poem with four lines, including "Throwing away the mountains and rivers, is it not my original intention? How can I bear the sound of the flute in this farewell pavilion? Today, my soul is consumed by Jiang Yan's rhapsody, in the future, do not make cold promises." Yu immediately replied with four poems from the Ding'an Collection, such as "Occasionally soaring into the clouds, occasionally tired of flying, I will only wet my clothes with tears and sweat. Whom should I be ashamed of for the moral teachings of a thousand years? Filial piety comes from poor families, as the saying goes." They were seamless and natural, and all the students in the school praised them. When Yu took the exam for government-funded students to study abroad, the original plan was to select 100 people, but thousands of people took the preliminary exam. The exam started at 9 am, and Yu sat down, writing quickly until 3 pm, resulting in a draft of dozens of pages, looking like a thick book. After briefly reciting it once, he still thought it was not appropriate, so he threw it on the corner of the table and wrote another one. He wrote until 5 pm, even handing in the paper earlier than all the other students. Those classmates with dull writing abilities had not even finished half a page. Seeing him walking away proudly with a stack of discarded drafts, they felt a great difference in mood, looking at him as if he were a celestial being. Ten days later, when the full list was announced, Yu was ranked high again. Among the works Yu created during his study abroad period, there was "Dream of Returning Home," written to commemorate his late wife, Wang. His most famous early work was the "Tokyo Bamboo Branch Songs," published in the Shanghai Minli Daily three years before the Republic, with fifty or sixty poems describing the scenery of overseas, truly being rare masterpieces in the last fifty years. Yu's literary relationship with the founding members of the party and the country began with this. Yu was frugal in his official position, with clean sleeves. He benefited from the low cost of living in his hometown and only thought of building a villa in the hills of the Fuchun River, where he could enjoy the scenery and the sound of birds singing in his old age. Twenty years ago, when I was transferring from North America to South America, Yu gave me a farewell poem with the line "Cherish the agreement in Yan Tan, and form a secluded alliance outside the world." Life is like a fleeting dream, and this agreement has ultimately become empty. Recalling how easy it was to study and read good books in my youth, I am increasingly saddened by the gradual backwardness of material resources and talent in the economic invasion of recent years. However, adversity builds nations, and every man has a responsibility. Establishing a nation and a country, death is more important than Mount Tai. Yu gave up his life to uphold justice in the face of the "Zhaofa Letter" during a time of turmoil. His physical body may change, but his spirit remains undiminished. He has made a great contribution to the spirit of national defense in the new era, which is unique. Therefore, I write: "Flawless is a god, with clean sleeves, the western sky is vast and ethereal. With righteousness as armor, with vast courage, the eastern sea is boundless."</p>

<h3 id="e103">Walt Disney's 1940 Production Plan: "Donald Duck" Takes Center Stage, "Pinocchio," a Feature-Length Film, to Be Released <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>— New Film</p>
<p>Walt Disney, the inventor of the cartoon film pioneer Mickey Mouse, as usual, after a year, at the turn of the year, has to decide on the production plan for the coming year. Now he has fully decided on the production plan for 1940. In his work plan, what is particularly noteworthy is that Donald Duck will take center stage this year, and the second feature-length film after "Snow White" will also be completed and meet the movie fans.</p>
<p>Donald Duck's appearance on the screen was a few years later than Mickey Mouse. Disney only had a plan to create Donald Duck in 1932, and Donald Duck actually did not appear on the screen until 1934. His fame is far less than that of Mickey Mouse. But now Donald Duck is different, he is also very popular on the screen. The number of letters received from fans every day is sometimes equal to Mickey Mouse, and sometimes even exceeds Mickey Mouse. Since Donald Duck appeared in "The Wise Little Hen" in 1934, he has also had roles in "Orphan's Benefit", "Orphan's Picnic" and other films, and often teamed up with Mickey Mouse. Since 1937, he has been able to stand alone and be welcomed by general movie audiences. Moreover, according to Walt Disney's production schedule for 1939-40, it will become the world of Donald Duck. Among the top eight short films produced in the spring, there will be as many as twelve films starring Donald Duck, so Mickey Mouse is eclipsed, just like being eaten by Donald Duck.</p>
<p>Disney's first feature-length film, "Snow White", was released and achieved great success. Now his second feature-length film, "Pinocchio", is about to be completed and will soon be released in the United States, and will probably meet Shanghai movie fans this year. The story of this film is the same as "Snow White", and it is not unfamiliar to us. Although the entire work has not yet been completed, Disney had been planning to bring "Pinocchio" to the screen two years ago, and had repeatedly held meetings with executives and staff to decide how to present "Pinocchio" on the screen. His careful handling of this film is evident from this. After two years of work, it has not yet been fully filmed. After it is released in the future, it will definitely be comparable to "Snow White". Let us look forward to the release and prove the prediction with facts.</p>

<p>— Qihua</p>
<p>After Laurel and Hardy co-starred in "Block-Heads", the old partners of many years once broke up, and Hardy also starred alone in a "Zenobia." The reason for Laurel and Hardy's popularity is nothing more than their silly actions that make people laugh, and everything else is nonsense. Therefore, their "Way Out West", which was in a secondary position to set off another story, gained unexpected success. But unfortunately, they broke up. Hardy is indeed a comedian, but his characteristics were not seen in "Zenobia" due to the limitations of the script. Now the first work "The Flying Deuces" of their reunion is the same as the previous works, with the two as the main body, and using nonsense and humor to complete a story.</p>
<p>The story tells that after Hardy was frustrated, he suddenly had the idea of committing suicide. After being encouraged by a military officer, he went to Africa to join the army. But he was not used to the hardship of military life and planned to return home, so he made many jokes. In the end, Hardy died in a plane crash and was reincarnated as a horse, which is even more absurd and makes people laugh until their stomachs hurt.</p>

<p>— Jiaming</p>
<p>When Fenghuang joined the Guohua Company, "Li Sanniang" happened to need this role, so it created her astonishing debut. Then she acted in "New Hell". I think she is very good at acting. She is twelve years old this year and is from Shanghai.</p>
<p>The first time I saw her, she was nestled against her mother, her dark eyes staring straight at my unfamiliar face, as if searching for some treasure. The first impression was excellent because she was more beautiful than on the screen. She spoke softly and was so polite, but she didn't act like an adult. She is still studying while filming, which is a very important educational issue. Some people often lose their studies after becoming "movie stars". I hope those who love child stars will pay attention to this point.</p>

<p>Yellow Crane Tower (Part Two)</p>
<p>The Peking opera *Yellow Crane Tower* is excellent and must have a basis. I once saw in the Yuan drama catalog that Gao Wenxiu wrote the play *Liu Xianzhuan's Xiangyang Meeting*, which may be related to this play. However, the miscellaneous drama *Xiangyang Meeting* is lost and does not exist, so there is no way to consult it. Yesterday, I read *Northern Drama Remnants*, which includes *The Clever Scholar Breaking Wine, Lust, Wealth, and Anger* in four acts. The first act is *Breaking Wine*, and its *Jisheng Cao* aria says: "For you, Han Xin was executed in Chang'an City, and the King of Han was trapped in the Yellow Crane Tower..." The following are all stories of drinking. *The King of Han was trapped in the Yellow Crane Tower* is exactly a plot point in the drama *Yellow Crane Tower*. In the book *Northern Drama Remnants*, some are copied from Yuan people's songs, and some are Northern dramas written by Ming people themselves. Judging from this allusion, the drama *Yellow Crane Tower* must have had this special drama before the Yuan Dynasty, or notes and unofficial histories were popular in society, known to every household. It is a pity that most of them are scattered and lost, and we cannot know their source. Now, let me give a general statement: most of the best dramas that are popular in modern times, with stories before the Song Dynasty, were once compiled into dramas by Yuan people and spent a lot of effort organizing them. Later generations used them as blueprints and re-adapted them into tunes. For example, *Qiu Hu Teasing His Wife*, *Xue Rengui*, etc., especially the Xipi opera. Xipi originated from Bangzi opera, and Bangzi originated in the north, which is a direct system of Yuan drama.</p>

<p>— Drunkard</p>
<p>Amateur theatrical performances have become commonplace. People with a little bit of face will always do this for festive occasions. A friend of mine recently held a wedding at Lake Society, and a few friends and I also initiated an amateur theatrical performance, asking an amateur theatrical troupe to perform Peking opera. The repertoire was solid, the performance was wonderful, and the guests and hosts were happy. However, I heard afterwards that the host side had some complaints about the amateur theatrical performances' banquet, which was regrettable. The reason is that there were twenty amateurs that day, and many of their relatives and friends went to watch or support them. When it came time to sit down, these relatives and friends also sat at the same table for the meal, resulting in the amateur theatrical performances' table actually having more than four tables. This amateur theatrical troupe was newly established, and this was the first time this happened. At the time, they just put it aside, but they didn't expect to be criticized afterwards, which was unexpected. Now, in order to protect the reputation of the amateur theatrical world and avoid repeating the same mistakes in the future, the amateur theatrical troupe is gathering to discuss a proper response method. I am also an amateur, and I am thinking about how to solve this troublesome problem. There are many amateur theatrical troupes in Shanghai, and there is no shortage of talented people. Gathering wisdom and benefiting from each other, I would be very grateful if you could give me your advice so that this kind of bad habit can be abolished.</p>
<h3 id="e109">The Pharmaceutical Association's Drama Performance <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>— Organized</p>
<p>The Pharmaceutical Association of pharmacists in the city's pharmacies and pharmaceutical factories is based to study academics and contact friendships. Recently, the drama team is actively rehearsing, and already has achievements. Formerly once performed in the Xiangsun Hall of the New Pharmaceutical Industry Association. Of course, according to achievements, it will certainly not satisfy you, but each actor has the passion for art. They are not afraid of acting badly, but are how to pursue acting well, so I hope the guests and friends give honest criticism. The first play to be performed is "Zhang Guan Li Dai", directed by Wu Ming, Xin Qian plays the old woman, indeed has the demeanor of an old woman, Zhi Liu plays male guests, Chen Ni plays land lady, expressions and lines are fairly palatable. Wu Hong plays Nv Rong, Beijing dialect is very fluent, Shou Ying plays police, also very commensurate. The second play performed is Yang Yan's "Divorce"), Uncle of Shuguang, the identity is just right, the dialogue of Nan Zhen and Ya Sheng of Su Yilin and Yunzhu, the needle points against each other, can be called perfect. Zhou Ming's land lady, just right. The third scene "A Midsummer Night's Dream", directed by Han Bai, Sha Xia and Xin Qian play young men and women separately, the love scene, acted in a sentimental reason, the gentlemen's first time on stage, to have this achievement, is truly commendable.</p>
