<p>日本一部分衆議貝於去年底發動倒閣運動，日來形勢漸趨嚴重。據日昨東京電訊，傳陸相畑俊六已率直向首相阿部表示，企圖「中國事件」的「解決」，不足為延長內閣壽命的理由云、意在促阿部去職。同時政界中一般高級人員，也因為阿部忽視衆議員的要求，表示不滿。昨夜某方所得東京消息，據稱畑俊六已在幕後着手於組織新內閣。顯見這次倒閣運動的主潮、已由議會而擴張到內閣的本身，已由主張發展為具體問題。近幾年來的日本內閣，完全是在軍部操縱之下：內閣的組成或解體，決之於軍部的支持或反對。四個月以前阿部是這樣上台的；現在行將下台，又豈能逃此例外？</p>
<p>不過到目前為止，阿部方面尚未表示退讓，而在竭力掙扎之中；最近有無急遽變化，還難斷言。至於這次發生閣潮的眞相束京電訉不夠做參考。表面上是為了內政，為了糧食和物價等政策，不能盡如人意；但從軍部的表示態度看米，就可知道實際決不會這樣簡單。阿部對於這種情形，當然體認淸楚，所以他不在糧食和物價等政策上作亡羊補牢的工作；而想從另一方面去設法，延長現內閣的生命，因此也採取過去一般日本政治家利用國外事件來緩和國內問題的老辦法。盡全力以進行所謂建立中國「新中央政權」的工作，以冀藉此拔出其在華的泥足；並利用牠來引誘美國，締結新的通商條約。據傳此事已在日本內閣會議中通過，業已奏請日皇核准；東京且有所謂和平條約（？）的傳出，其要點即為，（一）承認「滿洲國」，（二）簽訂反共同盟，（三）日本駐兵華北內蒙，（四）中日共同開發中國資源，（五）兩年後日本撤退華中華南駐軍，（六）中國鐵路收為國有。</p>
<p>阿部想以結束「中國事件」來對付倒閣運動，這是恰逢其會的政略。原來一九四〇年乃是日本國運上千鈞一髮的危險關頭：第一，國內的經濟，不僅無法支持長期的戰爭，甚至已不能維持社會的機能。去年年底日本國內紙幣，已膨脹到四十億圓；去年所發行公債，尙有百分之八十還存在政府的金庫裏；各種稅率，大多都是增高了，而稅額的收入却較過去减少；同時所編全年新預算，龐大到了一百零三億圓，較去年度增加約九億五千萬圓。試問要從何處才能取得偌大財源。其次，對美國的商約，轉瞬即將廢止，眼見新商約或臨時商約決無實現的可能，也即美國隨時有施行經濟制裁的可能；則日本一切經濟活動，都將有因原料和市塲問題而遭受巨大打擊。本月二十日日本國會開會的時候，縱然糧食和物價政策的攻訐，不夠壓迫阿部下台，但基於上述的嚴重問題，也將使他一籌莫展而終於引退。因此之故，他滿望「中國事件」能因所謂，「新中央政權」的成立而宣告解決，庶幾下野而猶榮。</p>
<p>可是事實與幻想，時　不知相差幾千萬里。阿部祗是有權保持他自己的幻想，可是事實豈能與幻想適應？過去的近衛和平沼，又何嘗不曾作過同樣的幻夢，無如事實都使他們失望。現在阿部企圖解決「中國事件」的計劃，在內容上並無一點新的進步，又豈能獲得什麼意外的發展。像上述的所謂「中日和平條約」，不問他的內容究竟怎樣，至少戰爭還是戰爭，泥足還是泥足，試問和平在那裏？</p>
<p>阿部解決「中國事件」的計劃之不會成功，日本軍部早已很明顯地指出。畑俊六表示內閣不應以中國事件的解決為延長壽命的理由，這就是說明「中國事件」的遙遙無期。軍部是中國事件的製造者，控制了日本國內的政治，同時也是身陷泥淖中的人。所以他們對於阿部的幻想，必能了解它祗是幻想而已。</p>

<p>華盛頓　據可靠消息、聯邦航業委員會、現擬建造三萬五千噸之巨輪兩艘、在平時加入太平洋航綫駛行、但一旦發生戰事、即可改成航空母艦、關於此事、該委員會當在短時期內、正式有所聲明（九日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>香港　東京電、宇垣大將昨日自海濱別墅返東京私邸、當日下午即返別墅、拒絕接見新聞記者、據稱、彼此來僅係携取書籍數册、朝日新聞系報紙、前曾預測、當議重開時、阿部將不顧倒閣派之決議仍擬應付議會到底、今日載稱、阿部對政局之心理已有變化、陸軍人士表示解決「中國事件」為彼等之責任、此舉至堪重視、蓋阿部首相曾稱解決「中國事件」為現內閣之最大使命、今陸軍人士有此項表示、益增政局之不安、阿部目前之地位、又有應有陸軍方面人士之必要、其性質與應付倒閣派之決議、完全不同、首相認為議員倒閣之行動、在議會之外、即不負責也、預料數日內政局之危機、即將急轉直下、（十日電）</p>

<h3>證劵　外債猛漲　內債平穩</h3>
<p>證券暗盤咋臼市况疲而復堅、多方似有漸感滿足之意、大戶之進少出多、或進而復出者隨時可見、久漲之後、稍起回風、亦爲極合理之趨嚮、昨日上午四號三十五及五十八號等需要仍多、大豐亦頗有吸收、但同時賣出者反較其收入爲多、而聯和聯益信孚潤利大通恒孚或斬多或新空、氣勢亦旺、市價乃堅而復疲、丙種又進五十元關、午後三十五號忽進忽出、已不一致、十一及三十八號仍有搜購、鼎康昨有需要、賣方浮多了結爲多、久豐聚鑫等亦均有出脫、而市價又略爲趨高、丙種冉出五十元、關裏關外、盤旋不已、始終未能穿出五十元零三角之新高價、或將再行盤小、以待新消息之刺激矣、市價結果略好五分一角、成交總數約共一百二十餘萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>倫敦九日電、今日中國外債掛牌行市續告猛漲、上檔之英法（英發）及善後（英發）各漲五鎊、英法爲五十鎊、善後爲四十五　、中法美金漲三鎊、爲五十一磅、其餘三種各漲二鎊、英德　（英法）爲六十鎊、克利斯浦爲三十鎊、費克斯爲十二鎊、　檔鐵路債券北寗隴海及廣九告平、京滬路獨升二鎊、爲二十鎊、其餘各升一鎊、道淸爲十六鎊、湖廣非德發爲十八鎊、又德發十六鎊、津浦均爲十五鎊、</p>
<p>有謂外債之漲、據本埠所傳、一謂與和平有關、一謂與穩定金融有關、但和平照目前情形絕不可能、金融如何辦法尤非一時所能窺測、特倫敦外債之漲、終不少與時事有關、惟謎底尙未揭曉耳、</p>
<h3>滙豐銀行派息</h3>
<p>全年共計五鎊　耶松派廿四元</p>
<p>滙豐銀行昨接香港總行電、本年份末次股息、每股可派英金二鎊十先令、（應扣所得稅）連中期股息二錢十先令、全年共派英金五鎊、（應扣所得稅）、並悉本屆盈餘項下、除分派股息外、並提營業用房產折舊準備金港幣三十萬元、餘港幣三百四十一萬一千元、滾人下屆、又該銀行本屆股東大會、亦定於　月二十八日在香港舉行云、</p>
<p>本市耶松船塢有限公司第三十四屆股東大會、定於一月二十九日假座怡和洋行舉行、一九三九年份末次股息、决定每股分派國幣二十元、連中期股息每股國幣四元、共派國幣二十四元、又此次大會會畢後、縱開臨時股東會、討論自動淸理事宜、據悉該公司股份一股、可派英聯船塢股九股、至其產業船塢一處、須俟出售後、再行分配云、</p>
<h3>股票頻高</h3>
<p>股票交易、昨日成交慶豐紗廠四十股、價爲五十二元正、比前又漲一元餘、</p>
<p>昨日衆業公所股市、開盤極堅、所有橡皮股及大部實業股之價、前日所跌去者、一度回復不少、嗣以獲利了結之風再起、各股重又遭殃、但不久跌風頓止、市况略趨寗靜、潛勢則堅、四海保險公司股上騰至十一元、耶松船塢股二百三十五元亦有做開、爲昨日實業股交易中之二大特色、</p>
<p>倫敦九日電、今日英商遠東各公司股票掛牌行市、漲多跌少、保安保險股漲一鎊五先令、爲二十四鎊十五先令、匯豐銀行英倫註册股、漲二鎊半、爲八十七鎊半、又香港註册股漲三鎊、爲九十鎊、古拉客林傍橡皮股跌落七便士半、爲二十一先令十便士半、其餘告平、</p>
<h3>金融　投機觀望　金市無榮無辱</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、變化殊小、起伏不大、交易隨之减少、惟某金號仍續有塞出、錢兌業方面不時代客方吸進、結果軋小二元、晨開提高十元爲四千零九十元、原因外匯報緊、及錢兌業收買、繼因滙市驟形轉鬆、某金號首來拋塞、某錢兌業跟踪亦代多戶出籠、遂即降達四千零七十六元低價、惟此時　市倐又趨緊、證券帮乘機撈人、且同時某銀號等亦代客戶拖進、遂被拉高至四千零九十四元頂價、旋乃外　回硬、獲利多戶紛紛來脫手、且金號重有　出若干、故迄午收祇四千零八十二元、午後因外滙無市、愈形平靜、祇證券帮稍來復出、價格略撳小、收盤爲四千零七十八元、全天交易僅千兩光景、銀樓飾金平定、海關等仍平、</p>
<p>烚赤再小二元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）初開匯市報緊、某錢兌業首來抬價買入、開市遂高十元、錢兌業進銀樓帮三十兩、爲四千零九十元、少頃外匯突報轉鬆、人心頓挫、某金號即來喊賣、同時另一錢兌業亦塞出不少、而買者大多旁觀、不久即降落十四元、錢兌業出銀樓帮二十兩、爲四千零七十六元、旋以證券帮見賤撈進、且滙市重形軟化、加之錢兌業某號及某銀號亦代客收買、遂步漲十八元、證券帮進金號十兩、爲四千零九十四元、此後外滙復又回平、證券帮趁高復吐、而某金號亦再來賣出、故徐徐回下、錢兌業售予銀樓帮二十兩、爲四千零八十元、繼而錢兌業互做廿兩、爲四千零八十二元作午收價、午後趨勢平疲、首由錢兌業互做十兩爲四千零八十一元、比午收撳小一元、後二時半證券帮稍來復出、又做低三元、證券帮寶予錢兌業二十兩爲四千零七十八元作晚收價、結果比上日續跌二元、全天十八元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤較高數元、收進减低二十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十餘元、均鮮做開、</p>
<p>飾金鎭日無變</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、始終未更、大同行仍懸四百十元、新同行與上價相同、收進减低十五元光景、</p>
<p>寗波最近金價</p>
<p>自國府公佈金銀辦法後、寗波銀樓業、即停止發兌金飾、人民欲求飾物、僅銀件尙可兌得、現甬地銀樓如天寶成·方紫城·新鳳祥等、均設立「中央銀行收金代理處」｝收兌掛牌、每兩雖爲三百六十元、然暗盤巳做到三百八九十元、人民方面、以兩滬市價相仿、且帶滬殊多危險、因出口金飾以一市兩爲限、故均在甬兌換矣、（濤）</p>
<h3>外滙起伏　範圍狹隘</h3>
<p>外匯昨日市况、滙豐掛牌、俱無上落、英美匯暗市、上落狹小、靜中微現緊勢、惟結果則無甚榮辱、晨初以美英匯兌續報上漲、致開市遂現英緊美平之象、價爲四辦士八五九三七五曁八元、嗣經日行三井首來扒吸、且因外行供意極淡、驟緊　四辦士八一二五及七元九零六二五、旋以港電突來拋塞、且沙遜與出口商及華行上海等亦互相吐出現貨、並聞匯豐亦有　出、價遂一度反硬、美匯　出八元關口、達八元零三　二五、英金亦長至四辦士八七五、第因洋行界見賤扒人遠月美匯、同時華商亦稍跟進、故重告趨緊、又縮至四辦士八四三七五及七元九三七五、入後扒者知足、而美行大通等仍富供意、是以復形回平、迄至收盤、與晨開相彷、結果英緊零一五六二五、美則無分軒輊、期貨潛勢、與現貨無異、</p>
<p>沙遜賣出英美滙</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條、近遠各長零六二五、紐約銀價仍平、倫數生金呆定、匯兌英對美長半分對滬升一二五、對法漲五十生了，美對英升八七五、對滬未更、對法大六二五、中央掛牌如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金四辦士八五九三七五、美匯八元、較前、英緊零一五六二五美則平平、乃匯兌續漲之故、開後三井首扒、且外行供意極淡、故市勢驟見軟化、迨九時一刻、英金已縮至四辦士八一二五、美匯亦緊達七元九零六二五、後幸港電適來塞出、不久再賴沙遜與出口商亦來吐出現貨英美匯、且華行上海亦拋賣現貨美匯、並聞其時匯豐亦有賣出、故一時頭寸頓感寬裕、是以情况步見回鬆、迨匯豐掛牌揭曉勿動、白銀平衡稅揭曉大半分、此後至九時三十九分、英金已回至四辦士八七五、美匯亦回至八元零三一三五、嗣以洋行界見賤扒入、同時華商亦稍結進、而賣者巳漸减少、致　象復見微緊、迨十時一刻、英金至四辦士八四三七五、美匯達七元九三七五、旋以扒者轉少、且美行大通某行等供意尚佳、致未幾已告回平、此後買賣觀望趨勢遂形呆定、迄至收盤、銀行現貨賣價、英金四辦士八五九二七五、美匯八元、本月份英金四辨士八四三七五、美匯七元九六八五•結果比上日期現英均軋緊零一五六二五、美則未分榮辱、下午週三無市、</p>
<p>香港申滙升四元</p>
<p>香港十日電、今晨匯市開盤平穩、英匯現貨不動、遠期鬆零三一二五、爲一先令二便士九零六二五、美匯現貨鬆零六二五、爲廿四元五六二五、申匯現貨升三元、爲三百零四元、日匯現貨微鬆二五，爲一百零三元七五、十一時三十分申匯現貨續升一元、爲三百零五元、其餘平穩、下午週三無市</p>
<p>天津英美俱見縮</p>
<p>天津十日電、今晨匯市開盤呆滯、英匯現貸緊二一八七五、爲四便士六二五、美匯現貨縮三一二五、爲七元六二五、申匯升二元、爲三百零四元、『聯鈔』暗盤續昂五角、爲九十六元五角、</p>
<h3>外幣盤旋帶軟</h3>
<p>昨日外幣、過程趨狹、勢成盤旋、英美金鎊供求稀少、市况穩定、金票中途供給較殷、結果美余票無榮辱、晚市仍爲十二元六角、英金票稍升、良以鎊價堅挺所致、港票需要微殷、市况稍堅、法郎新加坡荷蘭安南票等吸納未盛、市况鬆軟、坎票供給見增、市價稍賤、日金票供求勢均、市况盤旋帶軟、晚市爲一元、角六分四厘、朝鮮票供給趨盛、市價虛弱、晚市爲一元零五分、昨日市價、英金票升一角、香港票升一分、法郎票降二厘、新加坡票降二角、荷蘭票降一角、安南票降七分、坎票降五分、其他各幣未更、</p>
<h3>糧食　洋米定價略鬆　粳尖上落甚微</h3>
<p>粳尖米市前又一度回昂後、開手形勢續緊、一般客販依然不肯輕脫、喊聲頗高、若洋米仍爲大宗生路、一號西貢曾至三十七元、一號西貢亦至三十五元八角、其他早晚稻亦開至三十七元外、但本鄉店胃一動即懈、不敢多進、迺以臼來平糶事業將開始、故因種種關係、未免頗多影響、因之午時趨勢突又轉呆、無論零躉銷塲均鮮問津、市面遂難維持、反呈疲態、雖各地來源猶屬寥落、終覺難挽人心、結果實售開一號西貢三十六元半、二號西貢二十五元三角、早晚稻三十七元、全日市面僅一二角上落、</p>
<p>洋米來源不絕、除香港絡繹搬到外、西貢定貨亦在相繼運到中、國外定價昨電略鬆、會有一一號及砟米等多批接洽、大部份尚待復電作實外、昨市僅有一號西貢二百噸成議、價爲四十二元半、回籠原包售意略鬆、昨市已經做開四十四元、現貨被阻已經運出、人心回定、市亦回削五六角、西貢開三十六元七角、碎米三十二元八角、東京米三十三元一二角、中次照別、久未見市况之大絞昨亦售開三十二元八角云、</p>
<p>另訊、前傳某法輪自西貢運來大批洋米、今已證實、係法國火輪公司之阿島斯號、共裝二萬八千二百餘包、約今晨進口、停靠虹口公和祥碼頭起卸、</p>
<h3>麵粉堅俏　——小麥亦昂——</h3>
<p>麵粉　自廠盤漲達九元叫角後、而麥價同時亦昂貴、已到十六元以上、且洋麥以船位奇缺、祇證實阜豐廠定成一船、其餘均未妥交、所以人心更爲望好、各廠除供給本銷外、對於客盤不願開售、良以前兩日本盤與客盤相差竟有半元上落、目下本盤已加四角、客盤亦須照加、致客銷無形停滯、統　僅本衡及內地帮交易共一萬五六千包、聞回籠貨綠砲車喊價已近上元大關、但無正式成交、日廠粉步有起色，投機者趨之若騖、一月份鳳凰牌價開九元六角至六角半、二月份買戶多、已逼近十元大關云、</p>
<p>小麥　昨市亦形堅俏、蓋自廠家吃盤到達十元大關後、人心莫不興奮、市塲囤戶反不嫌價昂而暗中吸收、大都售於日廠、其價較普通可放大二三角不等、故華廠進價亦不得不被日廠所帶高、昨日貨方再擬喊高、而廠已不受、結果出阜豐及福新兩廠各辦穌常麥一車、價仍爲　六元原　、</p>
<h3>雜糧　黃豆銷塲活潑</h3>
<p>黃豆行市、續砌二三角、大局全由銷塲支持、故潛勢堅穩、昨南洋及本街行囤榨油廠都有問津、統計做開丁家州豆六七車、價爲十八元八角至五角、高品爲十九元、蕪湖豆四車、價爲十八元四角至十八元一角、南京豆二千餘包、價自十八元三角至十七元九角半、六合豆三車、價爲七元八角、江北豆四百餘包、價爲十七元六角半、太倉豆二百餘包、價爲十八元三角、及平湖杜豆二百餘包、價爲二十一元二角至二十元零二角、崇明沙黃一百餘包、價爲十八元六角至二角、又豆子昨由北沙來三百五十包、</p>
<h3>紗花　紗市難期振作</h3>
<p>紗市平靜、但趨勢依然萎靡乏力、此內現紗銷路、北帮雖有採辦、然皆係十支粗紗、二十支紗走勢獨遲滯也、故人心仍難振作、且二十支雙馬一月期廠開五六千包之貨、業已到期、非墊銀出貨不可、就此而論、市塲上添增一批籌碼、所以多方雖拉緊不放、但有部份對於遠期紗頗有拋空之念、於是雙方相爭尤烈、不知鹿死誰手也、</p>
<p>現紗晨開聞外匯微縮、塲內空氣稍盛、二十支雙馬開價爲七百二十六元、然買戶並未踴躍、市象益呈趦趄不前之狀態、少頃略跌至七百二十三元、旋以多方復來拉進、再升幾元至七白二十七元、然成交不旺、查半日間成交千九百五十五包、行情二十支雙馬漲五角、其他與上日不相上下、茲將各帮　買出之額量分別如下，</p>
<p>同行一、〇九〇　天津五三五寗波　四五　香港　七〇內地　二一五統計一、九五五</p>
<p>棉花祇同業買賣</p>
<p>本棉交易尙稱起色、不過均係同業互相賣買、廠方因紗價難以看升、反見下挫，只包未曾動辦、加之海外棉市亦在盤旋之勢、而外匯趨勢放長、所以人心硬中帶軟矣、蘇北來源、計通花一千五百六十七、包常陰沙一千五百九十包、北沙來六百八十六包、茲將現棉成交情形錄左、火草包　一六三·五〇　同行進二三〇包大中集　二一五·〇〇　又　一七〇件又　二一四·〇〇　又　二七四件火木架　一六六·〇〇　又　一四〇件南太　一六四·七五　又　五八包大中集　二二二·二五　又　一九四件火機　一六二·五〇　又　三二〇包通州　一七五·五〇　又　一八〇包下沙美　一八六·〇〇　又　九八包沙夾洋　一七八·〇〇　又　一四〇包三餘花　一九四·五〇　又　一八〇包大中集　一一四·四五　又　二〇一包</p>
<p>另訊外棉市價、紐約棉市、昨日因受大衆賣出之壓力及海外商之賣出、市况較形疲乏、然尚稱堅定、結果收盤價格較之上日跌落五六磅音、遠期跌九磅音、印度連同預測漲一羅比餘、埃及跌三五十磅音、利物浦跌十便士、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易殊爲靜寂、日來殊屬沉悶、各方俱以匯兌之捉摸不定、不知究將是鬆是緊也、同業間以現貨交易手續麻煩、不若購買紐約遠期之簡易也、故改操是業頗衆、茲將昨日棉市以美滙八元折合送廠價如下、二十支美　米特林　二二八·八五又　下級　二二四·七〇三二支　二四〇·〇〇又　下級　二二二·〇〇四二支　二四五·〇〇又　下級　二三七·七</p>
<h3>糖市　粗白步鬆</h3>
<p>昨糖市　見下游、公會劃盤現貨二四粗白、本棧五十六元半、小一元、外棧新到降度近元至數角、爲五十七元至五十六元八角、老貨五十六元二角、轉口貨小五角、爲四十五元半、太古車白略鬆、東棧B嘜五十八元半、西棧五十八元八角、CW嘜五十八元半、CX嘜元十八元三角、DY嘜五十八元、HX喀五十七元半、H嘜車赤亦小半元、爲四十二元半、荷赤四十五元、木綿白小一元、振記一號五十六元半、一號五十六元、本一號冰六十七元半、晶明冰六十九元、國糖僅開出惠州次白五十餘包、價爲五十一元八角至五十二元、刁靑雖叫四十六元、行方觀望未進、今日有糖二千包運寗波、</p>
<h3>疋頭　棉布明鬆暗緊</h3>
<p>去路仍以南洋獨盛</p>
<p>咋布市堅定、客路及海外實需蟬聯、雖匯市盤旋、囤戶態度猶豫、市盤呈明鬆暗緊之狀、略有一二角上落、申新富貴細布一度低至二十二元、旋又回漲至二十二元二角半至五角、英商怡和綸昌各貨售盤最爲挺秀、因兩廠出品現多數直接銷往國外、而浙贛帮亦點牌採辦、昨浙贛辦去粗布漂布等二百餘件、港帮南洋帮辦細斜色丁色布漂布一萬餘疋、本街成交粗布細布斜紋府綢漂布等三百餘件、天津帮辦粗斜藍布府綢一百數十件、又布疋今有五百六十件、運往寗波、</p>

<h3>人體秘密公開的研究　智慧萬能，果何來乎？　愛情幸福，今有法矣！</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士姚崇　性病專科醫師詹念合著</p>
<p>（診所）北京路四川路口中國信託公司二樓　（時間）上午十時至下午六時星期臼休息</p>
<p>近來有人，以發覺人體生殖機能的秘密爲奇怪！其實，這早已有人研究精深，將偉大的發明貢獻於普天下的人類了。凡讀過生理學或動物學的人，誰都知道我們的身體，除皮骨血肉之外，尙有更可貴的東西在；即神經　與生殖腺內分泌。神經系有感覺，傳達，大腦，小腦，脊髓，性神經等多種，均由神經細胞組合而再聯系而成。所以神經系好像網絡一樣，密佈在全身，專營感覺與反應的功能。但神經系有賴於滋潤者，那就是生殖腺內分泌液。</p>
<p>生殖腺內分泌係一種無管腺。乃腦下垂體，松果腺，腎與副腎腺，睪丸腺等的總和而成。在春情發動期間，此種腺體就特別發達，所以智力頓開，身體發育，面現桃色，聲音洪大……因此種腺體，不特主持生殖作用；且輔助發育，滋潤神經，調整新陳代謝，增强低抗能力；在受某種特殊環境的刺激時，尤能興奮神經，聚精會神，發揮奇才異能，成大聰明人，其喜怒哀樂的情緒，形之於外，乃成激昂慷慨道德文章之士！聰明是我人的至實，昔楚漢相爭。項羽的劉邦作殊死戰，時劉邦兵力不如項羽，乃答項羽曰：「不欲與君鬥力而欲與君鬥智」。結果，劉邦終成漢業。此歷史上昭彰之事實，足見智　誠萬能。</p>
<p>生殖腺內分泌與神經系的相互作用及其重要旣如此，所以男子必須自愛，力保其健全，萬一不幸因早年無智與好奇，犯有自凟遺精，早婚縱慾，或憂勞刺激過甚，致傷害了神經系，或虧損了生殖腺內分泌液者，則凡腦衰健忘，失眠心悸，腰酸背痛，腎痿不舉，早洩遺精，發育不全，精薄不育等症象即不一而足。此種痿弱男子，不特因精力萎靡，前途茫然；就是在戀愛塲中，或夫婦間的性生活上，亦必爲女性所棄，妻妾所憎恨，陷於人世間最悲慘之境地！</p>
<p>治療與預防方法，唯有速服健壯動物生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」最爲對症特效。爰此劑自德國生理學及醫學泰斗（Professon　Stenah＇s斯丹那敎授歷一生之艱辛實騐而發明後，曾震驚於世界之醫壇，認爲却病延年，返老還童確已有了新法。余在美國研究性病的特效療法時，亦曾以此劑作不斷的實騐，在一千僩性病患者中，服此劑而獲全愈者，佔百分之九十以上，其療效記錄，從無他劑可以超出者。誠以此劑質料貴重，監製精良，功效確實，補力偉大，爲任何類似製劑所來及。服後於一日夜間即生精補腎，健腦活血，尤貴不斷連服，則更助長發育，滋稠精血，補養神經，調整新陳代謝，上述各症，必於短期內痊愈。中老年人常服則延年益壽，返老還童。惟患遺精者，須兼服治遺特效藥「希米脫氏固精片」（中西五洲華美中英等大藥房均售每匣實價兩元）以制止遺洩，此效尤速。</p>

<p>女性的健美方法，差不多比男子還要費力，因爲女子有生理上的特殊徵象，如月經，妊娠等，所以一個女子，要達到健美的標準，必須要照下列的方法實行，方能保持長久，據全世界最著名的美容專家兼婦科能手法國威泥基博士及美國百特生醫院愛禮法克司博士，與魯興院長等的研究，認爲女性美的成功，必須有高聳的乳峯美，及豐腴而曼妙的臀部美，此外步行時的姿態等。但上述條件，均須健康來做基礎，尤其是女性體肉的靑春腺不健全，則乳峯即形萎癟，月經紊亂，肌肉削瘦，曲線喪失，甚至婚後生育艱難，即使一旦妊娠，必無健全的子女產生。因此之故，講求健美者，若一旦釀成如上的不幸，應迅即服以卵巢內分泌製劑女用『生殖素』，以使靑春腺卵巢機能發育　榮，則新陳代謝作用旺盛，自然月經準確，乳峯高聳，臀部豐腴，曲線明朗，同時面容亦必嬌艷欲滴，肌肉滑潤，皮下脂肪充實，一切充滿「健美」的活躍姿態，不媿爲一位時代的前進女郎了。</p>
<p>實例：本埠××著名百貨公司女職員，因爲體弱，生殖腺（即靑春腺）卵巢分泌不足，致乳峯萎癟，臀部瘦削，容顏憔悴，後來經西藥部某親戚介紹，服女用「生殖素」不到二月，前後竟判若兩人。不但乳峯驟然高聳，挺綻堅實而富有彈性，同時連得一向的月經不調症，也根本治好，面色紅潤，肌色晶瑩，見之者驚爲天人，咸一致稱道其健美不置云。</p>
<h3>遺精失治等於失火</h3>
<p>— 性病專科醫師詹念曾</p>
<p>星星之火，可以燎原，這是誰都知道是危險的。不幸而一個靑年，因無知與好奇，犯上自凟縱慾，或因憂勞斵傷，摧殘了性神經，使精關鬆弛後，則必爆發可怕的遺精。雖然在初起時，遺精的次數尚少，並且無痛無癢，似乎無關緊要，但日子久了，涓滴不塞，會潰成江海。不知有多少靑年，因輕症的夢遺失治，而釀成險症的滑精漏精；更不知有多少男子因遺精失治，而致身體大虧，患腦衰健忘，失眠心悸，腰酸背痛，腎痿早洩，發育不全，精薄不育等症，此種男子，必然精力不振，體貌不揚，求學不進，習業雞成，爲女性所厭棄，爲妻妾所憎恨，陷於失學失業失戀失歡的慘境；或竟因體無藏精，猶如機器的缺乏油料，致未老先衰，短命殀殤者，亦屬多不勝計！</p>
<p>治療遺精，等於救火！救火應迅速而澈底，治療遺精尤然！治療之法，據中外名醫及余等多年經騐，均以服治遺特效藥「希米脫氏固精片」最爲迅速而澈底，因此劑確能鞏固精關，鎭靜神經，服後於當夜即可收安眠止遺之神效，連服兩星期後，保證可澈底斷根。惟身體虧損已有上述症象之一種或數種者，須兼服健壯動物生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」，則於服後廿四小時內即生精補腎，健腦補血，輔助發育，滋稠精血，連服一月，保證可使百病霍然，精力倍增。中老年人常服則延年益壽，返老還童。患者若能親來診所兼施電療注射等新療法，則收效尤速！</p>

<p>根據工部局的統計，月前公共租界內共有難民收容所三二處，收容難民三七三一九名；從這些數字中，我們便可以想像到這許多無家可歸，顛沛流連的難胞，是在怎樣困難中過着生活，而迫切地需要着人們的援助呵！</p>
<p>最近，本埠慈善團體聯合會，鑒於目前物價的騰漲，一般貧民以及避難來滬難民生活的困苦，特斥資在北福建路三百三十號及徐家滙天主堂分設了庇寒所，第一庇寒所已經收容貧苦民眾八百餘人。解決了他們過渡寒冬的困難。同時爲了救濟凍餓交迫的貧民起見，在前天（舊曆十二月初一日）晚上起，更在馬路上施賑饅首和熱薑湯。</p>
<p>往年各善團賑放的地方，原在跑馬應南首　門路一帶，今年因為廿路無軌電車開始行駛的關係，為了維持良好的秩序，不得不遷到比較便利的地方去。</p>
<p>前晚七時光景，慈善團體聯合會的運輸車，載了三千五百多隻饅首，和二大木桶的熱生薑湯，到新大沾路中段一帶去施賑。在那裏事先已經結集了一千餘個待賑的貧民，衣衫都着得是很單薄襤褸，他們大都是小工·人力車夫·難民·和流浪街頭的乞丐·癟三·老的·幼的·懷着希望趕到這裏；把不很寬大的新大沾路擠得水洩不通了。</p>
<p>經慈聯會的幾位職員和捕房探警竭力維持，把所有聚着的貧民用繩索圈圍在行人道上，魚貫出來，每人分給麵粉製造的饅首兩隻（每隻重四兩，第一天共化麵粉八包，每包重卅六斤），和火熱的生薑湯一碗（是用土產生薑和黃糖煮沸而成，味道甜辣，吃了能增加體溫，抵禦寒氣的侵襲。）</p>
<p>這項施賑工作，是很實惠於貧民，自從九日開始以後，將到二月七日（即舊曆年終）始告結束。這消息應該替凍餓途上的貧民慶幸！不過，據說慈聯會裏施賑經費是異常拮據，尤其是目前［孤島］陰暗而逐漸擴大加深的今日，他們的施賑，更有僧多粥少之感。希望各界慷慨解囊捐濟！</p>

<p>英文大美晚報云　公共租界警務處試用西捕頭克蘭格、年二十一歲、今日（十日）午刻在北穌州路郵政總局排解爭吵時、突遭槍擊、胸中一彈、受傷頗重、今臥公濟醫院醫治、肇事者爲某淸潔公司經理某甲、已經滙司捕房探員捕獲、查該淸潔公司工人昨（九日）在老虎灶與郵政總局某局員發生爭執、淸潔公司經理某甲、乃於今日晌午持手槍一支、偕數人同往郵政總局、覓得隔昨和爭之某局員理論、復起劇烈爭吵、時在北穌州路搜查行人之巡捕聞報、人郵局查問、當克蘭格步入郵局時、上胸部突中一彈、發槍者是否有意開放、或忿怒中失愼所致　尙未可决、惟當時發槍　少兩響、開槍之某甲、乃被滙司捕房警員捕獲、</p>
<p>（本報特訊）昨日中午十二時後、北四川路郵政管理局大天井內、發生槍擊西捕克蘭格血案、此案發生後、虹口滙司捕房曾將肇禍兇犯鮑德培·及郵局包裏投遞組苦工翁永源·空袋間苦工孟某·」併逮捕拘押、茲據木報所得消息、分誌如下、</p>
<p>肇禍起因</p>
<p>郵政管理局於樓下底層設有老虎灶、專供局內員役應用、近以煤價飛漲、故對局內信差等取水　限制較嚴、規定穿制服者、方可取水、而該局之淸潔事宜、則包　遠東淸潔公司承辦、派有工人二十餘名、常川在局工作、並派由鮑德培者督率工役、該工人等近以取水時遭拒絕、與局工時常爭執、各不示弱、種因已非一日、</p>
<p>互起爭論</p>
<p>乃昨日中午、訴請鮑某前往老虎灶交涉、不意言語間互起爭論、鮑某當爲該局包裹投遞組苦役江北人翁永源·空袋間苦役孟某等二十餘人所包圍、鮑某情急、竟出自佩手槍示威、被圍者見槍、方始避走、不意走近大天井時、復爲共他二人所圍、鮑某之槍彈竟脫膛而出據目擊者談、曾擊穿遠東淸潔工人之鞋底、足部則並未受傷、</p>
<p>西捕中彈</p>
<p>雙方衝突方濃之際、旋聞於在北四川路擔任巡邏工作之見習西捕頭克蘭格氏、克氏當即進入郵局、偵悉前情、企圖將鮑德培之手槍奪下、詎此時大禍隨之發生、槍彈擊中西捕之上胸、一說檢彈走火所致、克氏於傷後、復扶痛上三樓用電話通知該管匯司捕房、立派大批探捕前往彈壓、並將行兇之淸潔公司中人鮑德培·郵局苦工翁永源·孟某等捕獲、解送滙司捕房偵訊、一面召救護車將西捕克蘭格車送公濟醫院救治、</p>
<p>克氏略歷</p>

<p>小談</p>
<h3>大家都來談</h3>
<p>— 黃嘉音</p>
<p>外國讀書閱報看雜誌的人所以多的原因，除了敎育普及以外，不能不歸功於西洋雜誌文選材的精當與切近人生社會，以及文體筆調的活潑了。世界上可說沒有一個天生不喜歡看書讀報的人。中國看書讀報的人少，文章不能引起讀者的興趣似乎是該負一部份的責任的。</p>
<p>外國不但讀者多，而且寫文章者也不限於文人。作家記者固然寫文章，達官貴人也寫文章，敎師學生寫文章，店員小販也寫文章，甚至舞女妓女流浪漢吿化子都寫文章，所以他們文章材料的範圍較爲廣泛，趣味也較爲濃厚。我們覺得這一點是我國的出版界所應效法的、</p>
<p>世界上何止三百六十行，要行行中狀元當然是不可能的。因此，我們唯有依靠筆與墨，印刷機與紙張，來傳達我們的思想，來表現我們的情感，來喜笑怒駡，來痛哭流涕。</p>
<p>我們相信每個人至少有一篇好文章可寫，問題就在肯不肯寫，所以我們希望每個申報的讀者都寫文章，每個自由談的讀者都寫文章。</p>
<p>自由談是一塊自由而公開的園地，我們爲鼓勵讀者寫文章起見，特先在這發起「自由微文」。以下是簡單的投稿規則；</p>
<p>（一）題目：如此上海（請把你心目中所見的上海社會的矛盾與黑暗，把你所親身經歷的悲哀與痛苦，以簡潔的筆調毫不留情地暴露出來）</p>
<p>（二）字數：不得超過五百字</p>
<p>（三）文體：自由</p>
<p>（四）信封請註明「自由微文」宇樣</p>
<p>（五）來稿請蓋章，不用概不退還</p>
<p>（六）稿寄自由談編輯部</p>
<p>（七）當選稿件隨時在自由談中發表</p>

<h3>緬甸小誌</h3>
<p>— 大年</p>
<p>此次緬甸訪華團到中國來，並在渝成立了中甸文化協會，可說是中緬邦交上的一大盛事。本文吿訴我們緬甸是一個甚麼樣子的地方。　編者</p>
<p>早上八點鐘了，你的緬甸僕人來喊你起床。他會向你說，「太陽已有一顆棕樹高了。」緬甸人一向是拿這句帶有詩意的話來代表早晨八點鐘的。同樣地，緬甸人深夜不叫深夜，他們叫那時作「人們不走路的時候。」</p>
<p>緬甸人是富有詩意的，因此他們的脾氣是那麼和藹，生活是那麼歡愉而有味。他們是遠東頂會尋快樂的人民，永遠帶着一副笑臉。緬甸有的是廟宇和塔。他們一直就在塔的鐘聲裏渡着他們的生活。佛敎中最精彩的敎義也就是他們的哲學。地理書上吿訴我們緬甸是以出口大米，油，和麻栗樹而知名的。不過偶然到緬甸來的游客也許會不相信緬甸人竟還有工夫去出口他們的土產，因爲除了九月和十二月兩個月外，緬甸人整個的時間都是忙着去吃喝玩樂的。平心而論，緬甸人是最不願多作事也是最不願常作事的人。他們讓象代他們在麻栗樹林裏作伐木的工作，讓蘇格蘭人去壟斷油業，讓女人去替他們照料米田。</p>
<p>緬甸的婦女在社會上是同男人一樣自由平等的。她們所做的事情比緬甸的男人來得多，同時享受的利益也比男人大。家庭的經濟權都操在她們的手中。市內選舉的時候，她們有權投票。她們可以私有財產，而且婚後所享受的權利跟男子相同。</p>
<p>在緬甸，男女都不穿褲子的。他們上身都穿一件棉織的短衫，下身圍一條裙子。每個家庭每星期之所需連房租在內也不過一先令（約合國幣四五元）左右。只有穿衣服算是緬甸人比較耗費的一項開支。</p>
<p>緬甸人一般是富裕的，這從他們的好吃雪茄烟就可看得出來。方頭雪茄烟在緬甸二先令可以買一百枝。因爲這樣的便宜，所以差不多的人都吃得起。婦女們閑着沒事，一天可吸上二十支之多。</p>
<p>娛樂方面緬甸人愛有鬥鷄和閹牛競走。後者在外國人看起來實在同烏龜競走同樣的有趣。</p>
<p>緬甸是文盲最少的國家，人民百分之八十七都能够看書寫字。因爲緬甸的敎育同宗敎有密切的關係，所以很多敎書先生由僧人來担任。緬甸人使他們的宗敎成爲一種給人快樂的東西，來適合他們那種樂天的態度。</p>
<p>各式各樣的交通和述輸工具緬甸都有。這裏有人力車，也有最新式的電車，還有二千英哩長的鐵路連絡着全緬甸。伊羅瓦底江中有名的小艦隊至今還不時駛往曼得利去。緬甸的交通工具雖然這樣完備，可是緬甸人却仍然認爲坐在象背上是一件最令人羨慕的事。緬甸人呼象作「兄弟』，因爲他們以爲象是最忠誠的動物。</p>
<p>史話</p>
<h3>誰是陳圓圓？</h3>
<p>— 蔣旂</p>
<p>『陳圓圓』將於今晚初次上演，該劇的作者特在這裏吿訴我們：誰是陳陳圓。－編者</p>
<p>陳圓圓倒底是怎麼的一個人物呢？也許有人會關心地這樣問。</p>
<p>翻閱許多傳記稗史，對於陳圓圓很多貶語，有的甚至把她比作一笑傾國的褒姒之流，眞爲陳圓圓洗脫的很少很少。</p>
<p>女人是禍水的這句成語是由來久矣，再加上古來的騷人墨客們總愛把英雄美人的『兒女情長」特別强調，特別渲染，不幸陳圓圓又沒有生得缺嘴或是麻子，於是，單單是她的美貌，已足够担當起『傾國傾城』的罪名了。</p>
<p>可是，然而未必盡然。歷史家們總算還沒有抹煞良心，他們寫出了吳三桂是怎樣甘心薙髮留辮，投降滿洲，怎樣苦苦追逼，把李闖逼得山窮水盡，又怎樣殘忍慘酷，親手殺死了明朝最後的一滴血統，－永歷帝，在無意中，我們却發覺了吳三桂不完全爲陳圓圓而才背叛祖國，投降敵人的反證，倒正相反吿訴我們，吳三桂是主要因爲他的政治野心而才這樣甘心傾國的。</p>
<p>如果這理，由還不够充分，那末，我想舉陳圓圓晚年入山修道，以了殘年的這一個史實，來說明陳圓圓沒有得寵，終於鬱鬱不得志之外，我更要武斷陳圓圓不是一個沒有靈魂，不明大義的女人。</p>
<p>陳圓圓早年是玉峯班子裏的名妓，但原本是大家閨秀，幼時也曾知詩識禮，因爲遭受兵焚之禍，被奸人所拐賣，這是可以從多方面來證實的。烈女殉節，大丈夫精忠報國，這一點道理，要求一個讀過聖賢書的陳圓圓理解，總不是過份的吧？</p>
<p>吳三桂，一個少年有爲的英雄，名將；自從陳圓圓嫁給了他以後，她是如何熱烈的愛戀着他呵，對於他的中途變節，投降滿洲，事先她可能不知道，但在事後，對於這行將遺臭萬年的作爲，陳圓圓會甘於緘默嗎？不會的，决不會的。</p>
<p>不論怎樣陳圓圓曾向吳三桂進了什麼忠言，這些忠言曾吾或多或少影響了吳三桂晚年再度向滿淸的反叛，陳圓圓，一個在常時社會裏沒有絲毫地位的弱女子，我們即使不能說她有功；但至少，從各方面的反證，我敢說，她是無辜的，淸白的。</p>

<h3>希特勒的戰時生活</h3>
<p>— 溫和</p>
<p>歐戰爆發之後，希特勒自稱是「德國第一名兵士」，現在他的日夜生活，就是「德國第一名兵士」的生活了。</p>
<p>從淸早一直到深夜，他總是同軍事顧問和外交顧問討論戰事。討論的地點是在保衛嚴密的希特勒新造的總理衙門裏，他的衣櫉裏總掛好一頂鋼盔，所以他可以隨時穿上他的總司令的軍服。</p>
<p>他的日常工作雖然緊張，他的生活還是同以前一樣的簡樸。他對全德國人都發了糧食證，可是這並沒有影響到他自己的簡單的食物。上午七時，他進第一次的早餐：喝的是些牛奶或菓汁，吃的是兩三片的焦黃麵包或是果醬麵包。兩個鐘頭之後，他還有一次早餐，這次添了些鮮果。</p>
<p>第二次早餐以後，他開始接見賓客。戈林差不多天天來看他，季特爾總司令也親自來報吿前綫的情况。此外常常來來去去的人員有新聞局局長台德里博士，納粹第三號大亨，希特勒個人代表赫思，外交部長里賓特洛浦，返國的大使們，還有元首私人參謀部裏的參謀們。</p>
<p>午餐的時候，希特勒四圍常有幾位親密的朋友。這一頓仍舊是很簡單的，通常是些煨燉的蔬菜。他不吃肉，可是也常有些淡酒或淡啤酒。餐後，再接見賓客。</p>
<p>只有十分要緊的事情時，他才離開總理衙門。他每天要到房子後面的園裏去散步，作爲健身的運動，走道上面有東西掩蓋住的，所以不論天氣好壞，他總要去走一次。</p>
<p>希特勒是個大影迷，衙門裏備有一間放映室，他夜裏就消磨在看電影上：看新聞片和新出的各國影片。</p>

<p>神秘明星葛萊泰嘉寶女士，最近因為芬蘭國遭受侵略，特將私人捐款五千美金，用「無名氏」的銜頭，匯往芬國，作抗戰經費，引起一般人非常的興趣。</p>
<p>嘉寶原籍瑞典，她很愛祖國，芬蘭的遭受侵略，會直接影響瑞典的安危，因此她便義憤填膺，毅然捐款援助芬人。據好萊塢影人們所傳聞的，嘉寶已用隱名捐了不少的款項，外間都沒有知道。而且當瑞典一旦遭受威脅而抗戰時，她是準備歸國服務的。</p>
<p>以前的嘉寶以反常著名，她歡喜淡泊沉默獨身，很少知道她內心藏着愛國的火焰。據聞她最近開拍一張喜劇片，即以莫斯科女間諜為背景的，情節將加以修正，且根本改為反侵略的影片，而由她自己任編導之職。</p>
<h3>藝壇雜寫</h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>于伶編寫女兒國</p>
<p>上海劇藝社的「祖國」，和「明末遺恨」一樣，一再延長演期：但演員都已不能支撐，最後幾天廢暦新年調了B組上去。「陳圓圓」的演期自然也不能確定，據預料，至多再接一個戲，可以演到農曆新年了。所以，于伶又在埋頭苦幹，編寫「女兒國」，預備新年上演。于伶曾寫過「女子公寓」和「花濺淚」，與這本「女兒國」，可以說是「女人」三部曲。</p>
<p>藍蘭再度上銀幕</p>
<p>藍蘭曾在陳鏗然的「女子公寓」中客串過陳佩佩，最近「祖國」下來之後，她有一個較長時間的空閑，恰巧國華公司定在廢暦新年公映的「董小宛」中缺少一位演員，就請舒適同藍蘭商量，再來客串一下。這角色戲並不多，據張石川表示，幾天就能完畢，趕上排「女兒國」是沒有問題的，藍蘭決定答應再上一次銀幕了。</p>

<h3>難童的集體　難光歌劇團</h3>
<p>— 晚萸</p>
<p>難光歌劇團，是全滬收容所裏的優秀難童們所組織的，他們的宗旨是「要從危難中奮鬥，去取得光明！」很明顯：在此時此地，連在困苦裏生活着的苦難的孩子們，也這麼地集體動員起來了。因為便於表現，他們的訓練，比較地歌曲重於歌劇。成立八個月的過程中，他們學會了幾十支雄壯激昂，刺人心靈的歌曲；以及排演了將近十個的獨幕劇，劇本的含蓄自然也是相當有意義的。</p>

<h3>完全女人主演的奇片　「女人」的花花絮絮</h3>
<p>— 徐徐</p>
<p>米高梅傾全力攝製的「女人」影片，根本找不到一隻雄蒼蠅，演員當然是女性，不在話下，連得貓狗衆牲，也是隻隻雌性，牆上懸掛的照相，櫃上陳列的擺設，也全是陰性。圖書室裏架上的書册，都是女作家的作品。</p>
<p>瑙瑪希拉瓊克勞馥賽琳羅姍三大女星，是「女人」影片中三隻香盧脚，一個是持家有方的賢妻，一個是迷人的尤物，一個是挑逗是非的長舌婦。笑匠卓別林婦人高寶蓮　，也在「女人」一片担任極重要的硬裏子。</p>
<p>瓊克勞馥的出浴鏡頭，足足拍了十一個鐘頭。浴缸是最新式的玻璃，滿滿的盛着人工泡沫，瓊克勞馥全部裸裎，演出非常精彩。因為特製的肥皂泡沫，只能持久—五分鐘，每次瓊克勞馥不惜犧牲，等待人工泡沫，加工製造，結果辛勞過度，這場戲拍完，睡了整整兩天，體重輕了六磅。</p>
<p>貴重的首飾，價值到美金五萬元，拍攝時候，爲了防萬一起見，特地雇用保鑣，四周保護。</p>
<p>服裝全是一九四〇年最新的式樣，有到二百三—七　，佈景三十五堂。一千三百尺見方的美容院，按摩體操，洗浴，整容，無不全備。</p>
<p>最精彩的一幕，是女人打相打的一場戲，雙方擄袖勒臂，先打耳光，再攢頭髮，一個恨得把她亵褲褪下來，一個恨得咬她一口。出現在銀幕上不到一千尺，却需要三天拍攝，才得功德圓滿。「女人」不日在大華大戲院上映，等着瞧吧！</p>

<h3>Prince Sha Issues a Letter to Fellow Compatriots</h3>
<p>Yulin: On New Year's Day, Prince Sha issued a letter to Mongolian compatriots in Yikezhao League, stating that, "On the occasion of the New Year, we should get rid of the old and bring in the new." He specifically listed eight matters that should be actively worked on in the future, pooling our collective wisdom and efforts to achieve them. (1) Omitted. (2) "For the popularization of Mongolian education, Mongolian culture is extremely backward, and the implementation of education is extremely urgent. Last summer, the Yikezhao League Middle School was established, and the primary schools in various banners have been restored one after another, clearly marking this purpose. The Yikezhao League Middle School should expand its facilities and recruit young people from Mongolian banners and war-torn areas to the school this year. Each banner should establish complete primary schools this year to popularize education." (3) Omitted. (4) "For health facilities, Mongolian banners have always lacked these. Last year, the Suiyuan-Mongolia Association decided to establish medical clinics and mobile hospitals in the association and various banners. The medical clinic of the Mongolia Association has now been established and has begun treatment. Each banner should also widely establish these clinics this year in order to benefit poor and sick compatriots." (5) "For the investigation of household registration and organization of Baojia, this is the basic mechanism for implementing autonomy. During this time of resistance war, we should actively engage in this. In addition to ordering each banner to strictly comply, the Suiyuan-Mongolia Association will regularly send personnel to various banners this year to provide concrete guidance." (6) "For increasing production, Mongolian banners span the north and south of the Yellow River, with vast territories and abundant resources. In addition to encouraging people to work hard in production, the Suiyuan-Mongolia Association will immediately develop all kinds of resources and control the economy to shatter the Japanese troops' dream of using war to support war." (7) "For improving animal husbandry, before the 'July 7th' Incident, the Mongolia Association had established a number of ranches in Suiyuan, specializing in improving livestock breeds and disease prevention. Subsequently, due to the Mongolia Association's move south, it was virtually suspended. It was decided last autumn to continue the work. This year, we will first improve the existing ranches in various banners and hire experienced veterinarians to prevent diseases." (8) "For banning opium, opium is extremely harmful in Mongolian banners. This year, we must strictly prohibit the cultivation and smoking of opium in order to eradicate it." The above eight matters are all urgent tasks for Mongolian banners and must be implemented this year. I hope that my Mongolian compatriots will work hard and concentrate our strength to achieve them together," and so on. (8th dispatch)</p>
<h3>Chinese Troops in Southern Hubei Charge into Puqi</h3>

<h3>Japanese Troops Break into American Church in Longzhou</h3>
<p>Beiping: According to a report today by Mr. Lang, a pastor at the American Church in Longzhou, Guangxi, when Japanese troops arrived in Longzhou on December 21st last year, they broke into the American Church and looted it extensively. They came again the next day and acted wantonly, setting fire to church property. However, the church had an American flag and other written markings, so there was no possibility of misunderstanding. (United Press dispatch from the 10th)</p>
<h3>American Ambassador Scheduled to Go South</h3>

<h3>Shandong Guerrilla Teams Active Again; British Consulate Notifies Nationals to Report Property Details</h3>
<p>Qingdao: The British Consulate recently issued a notice asking British nationals in Qingdao to report details of British property throughout Shandong Province, especially in the vicinity of Laiyang between Qingdao and Yantai. It is widely believed that the reason for this notice from the British Consul General is that the Shandong guerrilla teams have suddenly become active again. The notice stated, "The Consulate has received written notice from the Japanese Consul General, stating that the Japanese side has begun military operations on land and sea against bandits in the interior of Shandong, and in order to take steps to prevent nationals of third countries from suffering losses in military operations, the Qingdao Japanese authorities hope to obtain detailed reports stating the location and facilities of British property in various parts of Shandong where bandits are active, especially in the vicinity of Laiyang, and please indicate the markings on these properties that can be seen from the air. We hope to reply as soon as possible." The British Consul General's notice was issued at a time when guerrilla activity in Shandong has resumed. The guerrilla teams in Laiyang, Qixia, and other places are the most active. The railway between Qingdao and Jinan has been blocked for two days west of Qingdao in Gaomi. Japanese naval aircraft took off from aircraft carriers anchored here and flew repeatedly to the interior to bomb, presumably attacking the guerrilla teams. (Reuters dispatch from the 10th)</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang Sends Personnel to Inspect Opium Suppression Administration</h3>
<p>Chengdu: Since Chairman Chiang concurrently took charge of the Opium Suppression Administration in Sichuan Province, he has vigorously enforced the suppression of existing opium, abolished opium dens, set deadlines for addicts to quit, established many opium addiction treatment centers, allocated opium quitting medications, and evaluated local officials. He is carrying out all these matters simultaneously and with all his might. Fearing that officials at all levels are not implementing these policies effectively, he has divided the entire province into ten districts and dispatched inspection commissioners to various counties to investigate the implementation of opium suppression administration. They will depart within days. (9th dispatch)</p>
<h3>Sun Ke Discusses Constitutional Government Issues</h3>
<p>Chongqing: The issue of constitutional government has now become the focus of national attention and heated discussion. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited Legislative Yuan President Sun Ke on the morning of the 10th to inquire about his views on the implementation of constitutional government. He said that, strictly speaking, our country does not yet fully possess the general basic conditions for the implementation of constitutional government, but at this time of resistance war and national reconstruction, it is an important path, because constitutional government and political tutelage are complementary from a broad perspective. Political tutelage is the cornerstone of constitutional government, and constitutional government is indeed the compass for making political tutelage reach perfection. Therefore, the early implementation of constitutional government does not hinder the promotion of political tutelage. On this point, Premier Sun Yat-sen had incisive explanations. I believe that what should be paid attention to in the future is how to organize good local representative organs and how to earnestly complete local self-government. Constitutional government is greatly related to the development of civil rights, and I hope that the whole country will work together to achieve it. When I was in Europe, I saw that people from various countries praised our constitutional movement and believed that China, in the midst of a difficult and arduous resistance war, can still strive to develop democratic politics. The revival of the nation can be seen in this spirit. President Sun continued, "This year, many democratic countries in Europe have changed to a centralized system, and after the outbreak of the European War, even more countries are tending to reduce democracy. Only our country has actively promoted democratic politics for more than two years of resistance war. This characteristic is indeed a great development that has attracted international attention." President Sun concluded that the functions of the implementation of constitutional government can be summarized in three points: first, to complete political tutelage and consolidate the foundation of civil rights; second, to build people's political education and cultivate a standard democratic spirit; and third, to concentrate the people's will and complete the work of national reconstruction.

<h3>University Presidents Send Telegrams to US Senate and House of Representatives Calling for Economic Sanctions Against Japan</h3>
<p>Chongqing: The presidents of various universities in China recently sent telegrams to members of the US Senate and House of Representatives, requesting that Japan be subjected to economic sanctions during its war of aggression against China. (10th dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: According to Methodist Bishop Huade today to the United Press, "In my observation, there will be no new commercial treaty between Japan and the United States, because a treaty is not something that can be created overnight. However, economic sanctions against Japan will not be realized, but the export of military materials and raw materials from the United States to Japan will be stopped, because the American people do not want this trade to continue. As for a temporary agreement, I don't think there will be one, because if the United States signs a temporary commercial agreement with Japan, it is tantamount to helping the wicked and participating in Japan's war against China." In short, the American people sympathize with any nation striving for independence and autonomy. (United Press dispatch from the 10th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Invade Fengxi, Chaozhou; Major General Xi Killed in Action; Lieutenant Colonel Nishio and 1,500 Others Killed</h3>
<p>Meixian: Japanese troops who invaded the Fengxi and Xitang area have been fiercely attacked by Chinese troops for days, resulting in the death of over 1,500 Japanese troops. The remaining Japanese troops retreated in disarray to Chaozhou City. Recent diaries found on Japanese corpses confirm that Japanese Deputy Commander Major General Xi, Battalion Commander Lieutenant Colonel Nishio, Company Commanders Watanabe, Okata, Wakanaga, Nagao, Yoshida, and Cavalry Regiment Commander Colonel Nishida, and many other important officers were all killed in action. The heavy casualties suffered by the Japanese troops have made them afraid to act recklessly again. (10th dispatch)</p>
<h3>Jiangxi Department of Finance Improves Financial Institutions</h3>
<p>Ji'an: In order to establish a financial system, the Jiangxi Department of Finance will strictly divide the four powers of collection, disbursement, accounting, and auditing, implement them throughout the province, strengthen their efficiency, and improve their institutions. It will also formulate drafts in accordance with the outline of county-level organizations to plan the division of provincial and county finances and the establishment of township finances. It is expected that preparations for determining the implementation procedures and training service personnel will be completed this year, and implementation will begin in the 30th year of the Republic. (9th dispatch)</p>
<h3>Situation in Xi'an Remains the Same After Bombing</h3>
<p>Qingdao: Some foreigners who entered the Japanese-controlled area from the free area of the Chinese side, traveling through Zhengzhou and Kaifeng, have recently arrived in Qingdao. They claimed that the number of Soviet military advisors in Xi'an has greatly increased in recent months. The Japanese side claimed that Xi'an had been "destroyed" after being heavily bombed in October, which is actually inaccurate. The city is still in a normal situation. One corner of the old Drum Tower in the city center was bombed off, and the YMCA dormitory is no longer there, leaving only a pile of rubble. The Bank of China and the newly built Jiabin Hotel (transliteration) were damaged, but there are few other signs of damage. The morale of the people in Xi'an is surprisingly high, but merchants have many difficulties in handling goods. (Reuters dispatch from the 10th)</p>
<h3>Donations Received by the British Relief Association's Chongqing Branch</h3>
<p>Chongqing: The British Fund for the Relief of Distress in China (formerly known as the Lord Mayor's Fund) has received a total of 140,000 yuan since it established a branch in Chongqing in March last year. More than 80,000 yuan has been distributed, and it is estimated that about 60,000 yuan is still left. The Chongqing branch was established by the central executive committee of this organization in Shanghai after Chongqing suffered heavy bombing last year. Other cities such as Xi'an and Yichang have also established such branches after being heavily bombed by Japanese aircraft. It is reported that Shanghai has remitted 120,000 yuan to Xi'an and Yichang. The Chongqing branch has received a donation of 75,000 yuan from the Chongqing branch of Butterfield &amp; Swire, and also a donation of 3,000 yuan from British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr. It is said that this money was given by the British Ambassador to Chairman Chiang's wife in person for the relief of the bombed people when Chongqing was bombed in May last year. The Chongqing branch has allocated funds to provide relief after Chengdu, Jiading, and Luzhou were bombed, and has also allocated funds to provide relief to Henan Province.

<h3>Brief News</h3>

<h3>US Congressman Suggests China Not Station Foreign Troops, a Reasonable Solution to Far East Problems</h3>
<p>Washington: Democratic Congressman Voorhis told reporters last night that the troops of the United States, Japan, and other countries must be completely withdrawn from Chinese territory so that the Chinese can handle everything themselves without interference from other countries, because "this is a reasonable solution to the various difficulties in the Far East. This concept should not be regarded as strange. I believe that the Japanese will not completely ignore my suggestion." If this can be done, then after the outbreak of the European War, Britain and France have already withdrawn their troops stationed in China, and the United States and other countries may also follow in the footsteps of Britain and France and withdraw their troops stationed there. Voorhis then criticized members of Congress who "do not fully understand the situation in the Far East" and rashly made discussions, saying that congressional members issuing statements at will will hinder "others from trying to do constructive work." He plans to hold several meetings with government leaders this week to learn the truth about the status of US-Japan trade after the 1911 US-Japan Commercial Treaty expires on January 26.

<h3>The Struggles of the Japanese Abe Cabinet</h3>
<p>A segment of the Japanese Diet members launched a movement to overthrow the cabinet at the end of last year, and the situation has gradually become serious in recent days. According to a Tokyo telegram yesterday, it is rumored that Army Minister Shunroku Hata has directly stated to Prime Minister Abe that the "resolution" of the "China Incident" is not a sufficient reason to extend the life of the cabinet, intending to urge Abe to resign. At the same time, senior officials in political circles also expressed dissatisfaction because Abe ignored the demands of the Diet members. According to Tokyo news obtained by a certain party last night, it is claimed that Shunroku Hata has begun working behind the scenes to form a new cabinet. It is evident that the main trend of this cabinet overthrow movement has expanded from the parliament to the cabinet itself, and has developed from advocacy to concrete issues. In recent years, Japanese cabinets have been completely manipulated by the military: the formation or dissolution of the cabinet depends on the support or opposition of the military. Abe came to power in this way four months ago; now that he is about to step down, how can he escape this exception?</p>
<p>However, so far, Abe's side has not shown any signs of concession and is struggling to the utmost; it is still difficult to predict whether there will be rapid changes in the near future. As for the truth of this cabinet crisis, the Tokyo telegram is not sufficient for reference. On the surface, it is for domestic affairs, for policies such as food and prices, which cannot be fully satisfactory; but judging from the attitude of the military, it can be known that the reality will not be so simple. Abe is, of course, fully aware of this situation, so he is not doing any remedial work on policies such as food and prices; instead, he wants to find ways to extend the life of the current cabinet from another aspect. Therefore, he also adopted the old method of past Japanese politicians, using foreign events to ease domestic problems. He is doing his best to carry out the so-called establishment of a "new central government" in China, hoping to use this to extricate himself from the quagmire in China; and to use it to entice the United States to conclude a new trade treaty. It is rumored that this matter has been passed in the Japanese cabinet meeting and has been submitted to the Emperor for approval; Tokyo also has rumors of a so-called peace treaty (?), the main points of which are: (1) Recognition of "Manchukuo," (2) Signing of an anti-communist alliance, (3) Japanese troops stationed in North China and Inner Mongolia, (4) Joint Sino-Japanese development of Chinese resources, (5) Japanese troops withdraw from Central and South China in two years, (6) Chinese railways are nationalized.</p>
<p>Abe's attempt to end the "China Incident" to deal with the cabinet overthrow movement is a timely political strategy. Originally, 1940 was a critical juncture in Japan's national fortune: First, the domestic economy not only cannot support a long-term war, but it cannot even maintain the function of society. At the end of last year, Japanese domestic banknotes had expanded to 4 billion yen; 80% of the government bonds issued last year were still in the government's treasury; most tax rates have been increased, but tax revenues have decreased compared to the past; at the same time, the new budget compiled for the whole year is as high as 10.3 billion yen, an increase of about 950 million yen compared to the previous year. May I ask where such a large source of funds can be obtained? Secondly, the trade agreement with the United States will soon be abolished, and it is clear that there is no possibility of a new trade agreement or a temporary trade agreement being realized, which means that the United States may impose economic sanctions at any time; then all Japanese economic activities will suffer huge blows due to raw materials and market problems. When the Japanese Diet meets on the 20th of this month, even if the attacks on food and price policies are not enough to force Abe to step down, the above-mentioned serious problems will also make him at a loss and eventually lead to his retirement. Therefore, he is full of hope that the "China Incident" can be declared resolved due to the establishment of the so-called "new central government," so that he can retire with honor.</p>
<p>However, reality and fantasy are often tens of millions of miles apart. Abe only has the right to maintain his own illusions, but how can reality adapt to illusions? How could Konoe and Hiranuma in the past not have had the same illusions, but the facts have disappointed them all. Now Abe's plan to resolve the "China Incident" does not have any new progress in content, so how can it obtain any unexpected development? Like the above-mentioned so-called "Sino-Japanese Peace Treaty," regardless of its content, at least the war is still the war, the quagmire is still the quagmire, may I ask where is the peace?</p>
<p>The Japanese military has long clearly pointed out that Abe's plan to resolve the "China Incident" will not succeed. Shunroku Hata said that the cabinet should not take the resolution of the China Incident as a reason to extend its life, which means that the China Incident is far away. The military is the creator of the China Incident, controls the domestic politics of Japan, and is also trapped in the quagmire. Therefore, they must be able to understand that Abe's fantasy is only a fantasy.</p>
<h3>The US Navy Focuses on the Pacific: Strengthening Guam's Defense Works; Building a Super Battleship of 50,000 Tons - A Congressional Proposal Is Worth Noting</h3>
<p>Washington - Admiral Harold R. Stark, Chief of Naval Operations, testified before the House Naval Affairs Committee yesterday that the Navy Department requested an appropriation of $4,000,000 in the next fiscal year for improving Guam's defense facilities, such as deepening seaplane runways and building breakwaters. This appropriation is included in the budget of the Fourteenth Naval District in Hawaii. Admiral Stark told reporters that Guam has unlimited value for the United States, not only for the use of the air and naval forces, but also for the needs of commercial aircraft. "After Guam is fortified, its value is equal to two or three battleships." He estimates that it would cost $80 million to use Guam as a base for maritime aircraft, submarines, and small warships, and that it would cost $500 million to fully fortify the island. (United Press, 10th)</p>
<p>Washington - Admiral Stark's statement in the House of Representatives that there is an urgent need to establish a maritime aircraft base on Guam in the Pacific Ocean has aroused the excitement and attention of people in the House. Stark said that the required funding is quite large, and the first phase is requested to be $4 million (US dollars). Last year, the Navy Department made this request, but it was rejected by the House of Representatives. The main reason for the rejection was that Guam is only 1,500 miles from Tokyo, and building a maritime aircraft base on the island would be regarded as a provocative action by Japan. Now that senior officials of the Navy Department have reiterated the old matter regardless of the opposition of the House, it seems that they are determined to implement their proposal. (Haitong Telegram, above date)</p>
<p>Washington - Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Stark recently continued to report on the contents of the naval expansion plan to the House Naval Affairs Committee, saying that Congress had approved the Navy Department's construction of two battleships of 45,000 tons last year. The Navy Department is now planning to build super battleships of 50,000 to 52,000 tons, and plans to test 18-inch caliber guns. If the test is successful, it will be the largest naval gun in the world. However, such a giant warship will not be started this year. As for the two battleships that President Roosevelt requested Congress to build last week, their average speed per hour is set at 32 miles, which is actually no different from the 45,000-ton battleships. In addition, the Navy Department also requested an appropriation of $4 million to improve Guam's port facilities (Havas, 9th)</p>
<p>Washington - According to reliable sources, the Federal Shipping Commission is now planning to build two giant ships of 35,000 tons, which will be added to the Pacific route during peacetime, but can be converted into aircraft carriers in the event of war. Regarding this matter, the committee will formally issue a statement in the short term (Havas, 9th)</p>
<h3>Wang Zhengting Arrives in Hong Kong from the Philippines</h3>
<p>Manila - Dr. Wang Zhengting, former Chinese Ambassador to the United States, and his wife and two daughters took the "President Coolidge" mail ship to Hong Kong today. It is reported that Dr. Wang has been here for three weeks (United Press, 10th)</p>
<h3>The United States Actively Promotes Its Far East Policy: Philippine Newspaper Comments on Gauss's Appointment as Minister to Australia</h3>
<p>Manila - The "Manila" Gazette commented today that the US government's appointment of the current Consul General in Shanghai, Gauss, as the first US Minister to Australia is a manifestation of the "United States'" further attention to its Far East policy. It also said that although Australia is no longer within the scope of Far Eastern diplomacy, it is extremely relevant to the entire Far Eastern policy. This time, the US government has selected a competent person for this position, and we are also deeply fortunate that the US government has found the right person. Because Gauss was appointed to this new position after the talks held in Manila between Gauss and the commander of the US Asiatic Fleet, Hart, and the US High Commissioner to the Philippines, Sayre, it has made all parties pay more attention (United Press, 10th)</p>
<h3>The Philippines Increases Reserve Officers</h3>
<p>Manila - Philippine President Quezon appointed 48 Philippine reserve army officers yesterday to enhance the Philippine defense program. US High Commissioner to the Philippines Sayre inspected the US Army stationed in Ricochete yesterday and plans to inspect Fort Drum today (United Press, 10th)</p>
<h3>Under Military Pressure, the Abe Cabinet Is Shaking: Abe's Attitude Suddenly Turns Negative, Successor Being Sought</h3>
<p>Tokyo - The local morning papers still focus on the cabinet crisis. The Asahi Shimbun reported, "Prime Minister Abe is exhausted, and after talking with Army Minister Shunroku Hata yesterday, his attitude has shown a significant change, and it seems that he has reached a conclusion that the resignation of his cabinet is inevitable." At the same time, the army generals are still holding meetings and paying close attention to the overall situation, and feel that the current state of political unrest cannot be tolerated for longer. The public is concerned about the overall situation and predicts that the candidate to succeed Abe is the former Prime Minister Konoe, who is now actively meeting with various politicians. However, it is heard that Konoe may not accept this position. Sugiyama, Terauchi, and the current Army Minister Shunroku Hata may also serve as Prime Minister, but the financial and political circles are still listening to Ugaki (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<p>Hong Kong - Tokyo telegram: General Ugaki returned to his private residence in Tokyo from his seaside villa yesterday, and returned to the villa in the afternoon, refusing to meet with reporters. It is claimed that he only took a few books with him. The Asahi Shimbun newspaper, which previously predicted that Abe would still try to deal with the parliament to the end regardless of the decision of the cabinet overthrow faction when the parliament reopens, reported today that Abe's psychology on the political situation has changed. Army personnel said that resolving the "China Incident" is their responsibility. This move is extremely important, because Prime Minister Abe has stated that resolving the "China Incident" is the greatest mission of the current cabinet. Now that the army personnel have made this statement, it has increased the political unrest. Abe's current position also requires the presence of army personnel, which is completely different in nature from dealing with the decision of the cabinet overthrow faction. The Prime Minister believes that the actions of the Diet members to overthrow the cabinet are outside the parliament, so he is not responsible. It is expected that the crisis in the political situation will take a sharp turn in the next few days (Telegram, 10th)</p>
<h3>Japan Seeks to Enhance Friendship with the United States: Hoping for Further Development Before the Expiration of the Trade Treaty</h3>
<p>Tokyo - According to Foreign Ministry spokesman Suma today, although the date of the next meeting between US Ambassador to Japan Grew and Japanese Foreign Minister Nomura has not been determined, Japan hopes to have constructive development before the US-Japan Trade Treaty expires on January 26. Japan is now doing its utmost to resolve the pending issues between the two countries. According to the spokesman, the problem between Japan and the United States is not a matter of responsibility but a matter of friendship. He also said that Japan's feelings towards the United States are still extremely friendly, so it hopes that the United States also has the same feelings towards Japan (United Press, date withheld)</p>
<p>Tokyo - When a Foreign Ministry spokesman met with reporters today, he was asked whether many of the issues between Japan and the United States in China had been resolved last month. The spokesman said that several issues were under consideration, but none had been truly resolved. He was also asked whether there were any results from the Tianjin American Chamber of Commerce's request to improve the blockade restrictions. The spokesman replied that the Japanese authorities are doing their best to respect foreign rights in China (Reuters, 10th)</p>

<h3>Another Link in Balkan Diplomacy: Italy Courts Turkey; Turkish Economic Delegation Arrives in Rome; The Italy-Hungary-Yugoslavia Triangle Group Takes Concrete Form</h3>
<p>Paris - Italy and Turkey are both extremely concerned about the situation in the Balkan Peninsula. Therefore, the relationship between the two countries has become one of the most important links in the Balkan problem. Political figures here recently commented on this matter, saying that Turkey, as one of the Balkan Entente countries (Greece, Romania, Yugoslavia, and Turkey), naturally shares the same fate as the rise and fall of Southeast Europe. When the foreign ministers of Italy and Hungary met in Venice, Italy a few days ago, they had already thoroughly discussed the issue of the balance of power in the Balkan Peninsula. Once the Balkan Entente countries hold a meeting in the capital of Yugoslavia on the 2nd of next month, they will inevitably discuss the "Venice Plan," which is to avoid the invasion of the Balkan Peninsula by other countries, which has been decided by Italy and Hungary, to see if it can be implemented. Also, Hungarian Foreign Minister Csáky will visit Italy again in the shortest possible time to meet with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini to explain Hungary's views on the "Venice Plan." In short, the Balkan problem is a complex problem that urgently needs to find a concrete solution. However, whether it can be resolved depends entirely on the attitudes of Hungary, Italy, and Turkey. This is because Hungary must temporarily abandon its territorial claims against Romania (the Transylvania province of Romania originally belonged to Hungary before the last European war, and Hungary has always intended to reclaim it), pending further deliberation after the end of this European war. Secondly, the attitudes of Romania and Yugoslavia must also be paid attention to. Because Transylvania, Romania can be regarded as the outpost of Southeast Europe resisting Soviet invasion, this is one reason. If Italy wants to send troops to Hungary to help it resist invasion, it must pass through Yugoslavia, so the position of Yugoslavia is also extremely important, this is the second reason. Moreover, both Yugoslavia and Hungary are Balkan Entente countries, and when accepting any plan, they must take into account their connection with the other two signatory countries of the Balkan Entente, namely Turkey and Greece. Among them, Turkey has always occupied an extremely important position in the Balkan Peninsula and has the decisive power over the situation in the Balkans. Therefore, any Balkan plan is unlikely to succeed unless it obtains the consent of Italy and Turkey. From this, it can be seen that the arrival of the Turkish economic delegation in Rome today is a good sign of the good relationship between the two countries (Havas, 9th)</p>
<p>Hungary - The semi-official Hungarian newspaper "Hungarian Jing Lao Yi Bao" recently carried a telegram from a visiting reporter in the capital of Yugoslavia, saying that the relations between Hungary and Yugoslavia have improved, and the Italy-Hungary-Yugoslavia triangle group has gradually taken concrete form, which will form an important factor in the situation in Southeast Europe. In addition, Bulgaria and Greece may also join the triangle group (Havas, 10th)</p>
<p>Rome - Regarding the rumors carried in the London "Daily Mail" and other foreign newspapers that Romania is trying to obtain Italian assistance to protect Romania's interests in Bessarabia in exchange for Hungary's territorial demands, political figures here dismissed it as nonsense. Political figures solemnly stated that Romania is prepared to negotiate on the issue of ethnic minorities, but the cession of territory is not being considered, and the Hungarian government has not clearly expressed its demands for amending the Treaty of Trianon. Only Hungarian public opinion generally demands the return of all territories before the Treaty of Trianon was signed. According to the Treaty of Trianon, Hungary ceded a total of 102,282 kilometers of territory to Romania (Haitong Telegram, 10th)</p>
<p>Budapest - The semi-official Hungarian News Agency announced last night that the rumor spread by the Roman newspaper "Lavoro Bao" that Hungarian Foreign Minister Csáky will visit Rome on the 11th of this month is not in line with the facts (Haitong Telegram, 10th)</p>
<p>Rome - Political observers here learned that Hungarian Foreign Minister Chai Ji flew from Budapest to Rome to meet with Mussolini after the news that Italian Foreign Minister Ciano had proposed a definite cooperative proposal from the Italian government at a meeting in Venice at the end of the week. The communiqué issued at the time stated that the opinions of the two governments were completely consistent. Generally, it is expected that Chai Ji will announce that Hungary and Italy have reached a complete agreement. Chai Ji originally planned to go to San Remo for vacation, but after the talks in Venice, he suddenly urged to return to Budapest. It is believed that Chai Ji had to change his original plan because Italy had some important suggestions (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<p>Rome - The news carried in yesterday's evening papers confirmed that Hungarian Foreign Minister Sáki will come to Rome to discuss important matters with Italian Foreign Minister Ciano, and plans to pay respects to Prime Minister Mussolini and report everything. It is generally believed that Hungary's political activities this time are related to the resolution of the Danube Basin and the Balkan issue, and Italy is paying close attention to it (Haitong Telegram, 10th)</p>
<h3>Hungary and Greece Sign Temporary Trade Agreement</h3>
<p>Budapest - The trade agreement between Hungary and Greece has expired. Foreign Minister Csáky signed a temporary agreement with the Greek Minister to Hungary, Bibi Nairis, at the Foreign Ministry yesterday, stipulating that the trade agreement and clearing agreement between the two countries will be extended, and some of its provisions will be revised (Havas, 10th)</p>
<h3>Lithuania Achieves Considerable Success in Trade Negotiations with Three Countries</h3>
<p>Kaunas - The Lithuanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs is currently conducting trade negotiations with several countries, of which the negotiations with Germany are particularly prominent. Due to the European War, Lithuania has encountered difficulties in trade with distant countries, so it wants to increase trade activities with neighboring countries to compensate for its losses. Therefore, the possibility of promoting the exchange of goods is being discussed. The commercial representatives of Latvia and Estonia will arrive in the Lithuanian capital in the middle of this month to continue the negotiations held by the heads of the economic departments of the three countries in Riga. It is heard that the main purpose is to adopt common principles in international trade and take common actions in purchasing raw materials. Currently, the Lithuanian commercial delegation is in Berlin discussing the technical issues of the free port zone in Memel, such as issues related to the customs organization. The responsible party believes that normal trade can begin in the Lithuanian free port zone on January 15 (Haitong Telegram, 10th)</p>
<h3>London Newspapers Report on German-Italian Relations: Göring and Others Dissatisfied with Pro-Soviet Stance</h3>
<p>London - According to reports in local newspapers, a dispute has arisen between Germany and Italy since Germany refused to allow Italian arms to transit through the country to Finland, and it is likely to cause serious consequences in the future. The Times correspondent in Rotterdam, Netherlands also telegraphed that Italy's determination to prevent the Soviet Union from expanding its influence in Southeast Europe is enough to strain relations between Germany and Italy. Germany will have to choose between Italy and the Soviet Union, two allied countries, in order to determine which country it is most beneficial to befriend. The Daily Express published a telegram from a correspondent in the capital of Denmark, saying that after the Soviet Union used troops against Finland, it suffered repeated setbacks. German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and Aviation Minister General Göring had become increasingly at odds with each other as a result. General Göring openly criticized the government's pro-Soviet policy, which became increasingly blatant. Although some generals previously supported the establishment of an alliance treaty with the Soviet Union to protect the security of the eastern front, at this point, these generals all believe that the Soviet Union is no longer a threat to Germany, and they are gradually dissatisfied with the government's current policy. The decline in Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's prestige is also an important reason (Havas, 10th)</p>
<h3>Belgium and the Netherlands Continue Economic Cooperation</h3>
<p>Brussels - Officials here said that the rumors that Belgium does not intend to cooperate with the Netherlands in overseas cargo transportation in the future are not credible. The purpose of the economic negotiations recently conducted in the capitals of Belgium and the Netherlands is none other than to maintain the commercial agreements between the two countries (Haitong Telegram, 10th)</p>

<p>London - Another large British merchant ship (10,000 tons) was recently hit by a mine in a minefield off the southeast coast of England. The ship was the mail ship Dunbar Castle, which sank after hitting a mine last night. There were a total of 200 passengers and crew on board, and 78 passengers have been rescued ashore, while the rest are feared to have died. The captain and first mate were among the injured. It is reported that the Dunbar Castle was built in 1930 (Reuters Telegram, 10th)</p>
<p>London - The Dunbar Castle sank yesterday after hitting a German mine off the southeast coast of England. The ship was sailing from England to Cape Town and carried a total of 200 passengers and crew. The wheelhouse and deck were destroyed by the explosion after hitting the mine. Captain Canston and two crew members were killed on the spot. A total of about 48 passengers boarded lifeboats and drifted at sea before being rescued by a motor barge and sent ashore. According to survivors, the ship set anchor at 9:00 a.m. yesterday, and shortly after lunch, a huge explosion was heard, shaking the entire ship. The lights went out, and the ship began to list to starboard. At that time, the passengers on board were not flustered and all wanted to return to their cabins to pack their clothes and valuables, but they all failed to do so. Later, they all gathered on the deck and boarded the lifeboats before being rescued. The surviving crew and passengers expressed their condolences for the heroic death of Captain Canston (Reuters Telegram, 10th)</p>
<p>Berlin - The official gazette issued here yesterday stated that German fighter planes flew to the east coast of England and Scotland on the morning and evening of the 9th to scout and attack several British munitions ships and armed merchant ships. The German planes safely returned to their defense zone after completing their mission (Haitong Telegram, 10th)</p>
<p>London - German pilots yesterday again carried out their terror tactics against merchant ships, fishing boats, and other non-combatant vessels, with the attack on a ship of Trinity Church being the most brutal. At the time, the ship was performing relief work, so it was carrying a large number of people. An injured person recently described the situation of a German plane dropping bombs, saying that several bombs hit the ship, and everyone rushed to the lifeboats in an attempt to escape. However, the German plane dived down and strafed with machine guns, piercing the boats, causing the deck to be covered with wounded. Some of the wounded are now being treated in hospitals, and they have been injured by bullets and shrapnel, and their injuries are quite serious (Reuters Telegram, 10th)</p>
<h3>Stagnant Soviet-Finnish War Situation; Soviet Troops Retreat in the Märkäjärvi Area; Finnish President Condemns Soviet Bombing</h3>
<p>Helsinki: Yesterday, Finnish military reports stated that, apart from reconnaissance activities and small-scale artillery battles, no major events occurred on the front lines. (Hai Tong News Agency, 10th)</p>

As a result, Soviet troops retreated several kilometers east of Suomussalmi. Reconnaissance activities occurred in the Repola and Petrozavodsk districts. Artillery fire in the Karelian Isthmus gradually diminished. Air force activities were limited by adverse weather conditions. (TASS, 10th)</p>
<p>Helsinki: A large number of Soviet troops concentrated in the Salla area have begun to launch an offensive after weeks of fierce fighting in the forests. It is reported that Soviet troops have occupied the village of Salla, located 65 kilometers from the Soviet border, and advanced 40 kilometers towards Kemijärvi.

<p>Helsinki: The Finnish President received foreign journalists today and issued a statement, strongly condemning the Soviet aircraft for indiscriminately bombing undefended cities and strafing civilians with machine guns. He stated, "Soviet bandits are fighting against our troops, and furthermore, they send aircraft to our rear every day to massacre civilians and bomb civilian houses. Fortunately, our country has taken effective preventive measures in advance. Although the casualties among the people are not extremely high, they are still appalling. In the past month, there have been over 700 casualties, including 234 deaths, 269 seriously injured, and 210 slightly injured. As for enemy aircraft shot down by us, there have already been as many as 170. Our air defense capabilities are also increasing daily due to the capture of many Soviet anti-aircraft guns."

<p>Stockholm: The "Svenska Dagbladet" here reports that Finnish troops have captured several Soviet armored snowmobiles on the front line of Suomussalmi. This is a secret weapon used by the Soviet Union to invade Finland. This type of snowmobile is shaped like a torpedo and equipped with a propeller, with a speed of up to 160 kilometers per hour. It is also equipped with a small cannon and is superior to tanks in traveling on snow. However, the armor is not thick. Under the intense machine gun fire of the Finnish troops, the drivers become overly excited and often lose control, which is its biggest weakness. According to Finnish officers, this new weapon is very easy to deal with. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<p>London: According to Rome radio news, the railway between Leningrad and Murmansk has repeatedly been cut off by Finnish ski patrols and bombers.

In the past few days, he has met with delegations from the American Christian Lutheran Church, the Sabbath Church, and the Baptist Church to discuss the mission undertaken by Mr. Taylor. All of these delegations have not raised any objections to mutual cooperation in establishing lasting peace when the war ends.

<h3>British War Cabinet Approves Establishment of Air Force Command in France; Barratt Appointed Commander-in-Chief, Will Take Office Soon; Artillery Battles on the Western Front, British Aircraft Reconnoiter Northwest Germany</h3>
<p>London: 10 Downing Street announced last night that all British Royal Air Force units in France would be merged into the British Air Force in France, commanded by Air Marshal Barratt. (United Press, 10th)</p>
<p>London: Official circles announced that an Air Force Command will be established to govern all British Air Force units in France, named the "British Air Force in France" and placed under the command of the Air Force Commander-in-Chief. The Commander-in-Chief will consult with the relevant Army Commander-in-Chief and be responsible for ensuring that the British Air Force provides the most effective assistance to the British Expeditionary Force and the French Army on the Western Front. He will also work with the French Air Force Commander-in-Chief to coordinate the actions of the British and French Air Forces in France. The above arrangement does not change the principles of the relationship between the Army and the Air Force, but is based on the existing relationship between the British Navy and the Coastal Air Force Command, in order to ensure the closest cooperation between the land and air forces on the battlefield. In November of last year, the British authorities conducted a detailed review of the experience gained by the British Air Force in assisting the British Army in France. As a result, a proposal was made to establish the British Air Force Command in France. It was approved by the War Cabinet in early December. The Air Ministry stated that Air Chief Marshal Barratt has been appointed as the Commander-in-Chief of the British Air Force in France and will take office soon. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<p>London: Regarding the appointment of Air Chief Marshal Barratt as the Commander of the British Air Force Front, responsible sources here recently stated that Commander Barratt is not subject to the control of General Gort, Commander of the British Expeditionary Force, but is directly responsible to Air Chief of Staff Newall. Air Chief Marshal Barratt is 48 years old this year and is one of the youngest British Air Force generals. He made outstanding military achievements during the last European War. After the war, he served as the chief instructor at the Andover Air Force College. In 1931, he was transferred to India as the commander of the Air Force Brigade in North Chahar. In 1936, he was transferred to the president of the Air Force College, and he has been there ever since. (Havas, 9th)</p>

<h3>German Naval Commander Delivers Speech Encouraging Dock Workers</h3>
<p>Berlin: German Naval Commander-in-Chief Admiral Raeder delivered speeches to naval dock workers in Kiel and Wilhelmshaven on the previous two days, explaining the war aims of Germany and the Allied countries. His remarks were roughly as follows: "We are fighting for Germany's rights and for the future of Germany's descendants. If we unite and always stand behind the leader, Hitler, victory will surely belong to us. Our current responsibility is to lay a solid foundation for the country's livelihood. Our responsibility for creating history today is worth any sacrifice. Dock workers should work even harder in the future and strive to produce. Everyone should stick to their positions and do their best, so that whether they are at the front or in the rear, they will have great benefits for the motherland." (Hai Tong News Agency, 10th)</p>
<h3>Strange Aircraft Bombs Rømø Island, Denmark; Strange Aircraft Also Discovered in The Hague; Dutch Aircraft Lost and Lands in Belgium</h3>

According to the officers, they lost their way and lacked gasoline, so they had to land in Belgium. It is generally believed that since the aircraft belongs to a neutral country, it should be allowed to fly away. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<p>The Hague: This morning, an aircraft of unknown nationality flew over the vicinity of The Hague. Local anti-aircraft artillery immediately opened fire to drive it away. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<h3>Chamberlain Condemns Soviet Attack on Finland and Reiterates the Purpose of the Allied War</h3>
<p>London: British Prime Minister Chamberlain strongly condemned the Soviet attack on Finland yesterday at the Mansion House, beginning a national propaganda campaign. Members of the War Cabinet will also address the public to reiterate the purpose of the Allied war and strengthen the public's determination to make sacrifices for the war. In his speech, Chamberlain (1) explained his firm intention to make every effort to achieve a victorious end to the war, (2) refuted the absurd claim that the Allied countries wanted to destroy the German people, (3) stated the necessity of increasing exports and reducing imports, (4) reviewed Britain's victory at sea, and (5) expressed the hope that the British-French commercial and economic agreement would continue until after the war. When Chamberlain mentioned Finland, he said, "When I look beyond the borders of this country, I always feel that the disasters I have mentioned before can easily and quickly spread if they are not quickly stopped. After Germany imposed barbaric force on unfortunate Poland, today we can see how it treats the people of Poland and Czechoslovakia, occupying its resources, seizing its food, shooting its people, and destroying its homes in order to relocate Germans. And Germans are also forced to leave the land where they have lived for generations. Germany and the Soviet Union signed an alliance and set an example for the Soviet Union to invade. So Finland is now attacked by the Soviet Union. Finland today is treading on snow and ice, fighting against stubborn enemies, and like us, what it is fighting for is also freedom and justice. Its patriotic enthusiasm and amazing victory make us admire it endlessly. What we can tell this loyal and brave people with certainty is that we must respond to the resolutions passed in Geneva and never make it a mere formality." The British Prime Minister continued to talk about his efforts to seek victory in the war, saying that since the day the war was declared, his thoughts and actions have been concentrated on one thing, that is, to make the war a victorious end through the closest cooperation between Britain and France. In order to achieve this goal, he considers the idea of fatigue, the views of parties, and personal feelings to be unimportant. As long as he is in office, no matter how difficult it is, he will never give up what he believes is a proper and inevitable responsibility until the war ends. This New Year is almost an eventful day in world history. Although the New Year has quietly passed, this is just the tranquility before the storm. The war can be said to be in full swing. Now, just reviewing the trends of the first four months after the start of the war at sea, the results are satisfactory. There are no more German ships in the world's oceans. Germany had less than a quarter of the number of ships as Britain at the beginning of the war. Now, due to being captured, sunk, or scuttled, it has lost 228,000 tons. The rest either hide in neutral ports or are in the Baltic Sea. Attacking our ships with submarines, raiding ships, or torpedoes is of course a broader target, but so far the results have been extremely small. If we offset our ship losses with the enemy ships we captured, the new ships we built, and the foreign ships we obtained, then our losses are now only 122,000 tons, which is less than 1% of our total ships. One thousand and one hundred million tons of British ships travel to and from the major oceans every day. During this period, we lost two large warships and several small warships. The more serious thing is that I am sure that our experience in wartime communication can be a valuable link that remains in place after the war and creates a broader and deeper connection. Because the work that can most easily facilitate peacebuilding is none other than this. And what can most promote the results of expanding British and French financial and economic cooperation to the European countries or to the entire world is also none other than this. "The British Prime Minister spoke again about domestic affairs, saying that since the implementation of compulsory military service, 2.5 million to 2.75 million people have registered and are ready to be called into the army at any time. With the addition of the regular army, reserve team, and auxiliary team before the war, the war will inevitably reduce this, or ask why not use the unemployed to manufacture civilian products. It is important to know that the number of unemployed people is misleading, because it includes 500,000 people who are doing this job today and changing to other things tomorrow. The rest are only temporarily unemployed, and their number will decrease day by day, because most of them are gradually being absorbed by military factories. Increasing exports and reducing imports are essential plans for us. Civilian meat will also be subject to a distribution system soon to limit it. There is no reason to say that there is a lack of healthy food in the country, but when necessary, we should expand the food distribution system. What is sad is the loss of some valuable lives in the navy and merchant fleet, but our maritime power has not been damaged at all. The failure of the German ship Spee is one of the best naval achievements in British history. The German ship sank itself without a fight, which not only eliminated the threat of the enemy ship wreaking havoc in the South Atlantic, but also caused irreparable damage to the reputation of the German navy in the world. The pressure of British maritime power on the enemy is now increasing its difficulties, and the results are not yet clear to the public, but it can be seen from the German leader's Christmas speech that they are paying attention to this. "The British Prime Minister then spoke about Britain's sympathy for the Turkish earthquake and flood, saying that the disaster in Turkey was very serious, and the number of casualties was more than all the casualties in the many weeks of the warring countries. The British and French governments have provided relief funds and will provide further assistance in the future. The cooperation between Britain and France in humanitarian undertakings is a testament to the close cooperation between the two countries, because Britain and France cooperate in all aspects of military, political, financial, and economic matters during the war. The automatic enlistment of volunteers and the increasingly expanding air force and navy show that the mobilization of British manpower for military purposes has now reached a very large scale. In addition, Britain also has a military-civilian defense system based on air defense preparations. The danger of air raids cannot be said to be over or reduced. It would be a big mistake not to continue the policy of defending against air raids. The children who had been evacuated have now returned to the cities. This is regrettable. I hope that parents will put their children in a safer place and endure the temporary separation of the family. This is also one of the sacrifices necessary to achieve the final victory. The British people are all determined to win victory and eliminate Germany's aggression policy, but they must not think that they can live a carefree life like in peacetime because the current war does not have the form of 1914. Although we are not currently having actual warfare on land, we are preparing to launch a major offensive at the appropriate time. Therefore, we are now pouring our manpower into the production of ammunition, so we are not hesitant about the manpower needed for civilian products. Finally, the British Prime Minister said, "Now it is becoming clearer and clearer that the German government has long planned a progressive stage of aggression. The more it gets, the more it wants. Today, German government officials openly claim that they want to achieve the goal of destroying the British Empire. Undoubtedly, they are eager to be able to treat us in the same way that they treat those in their grasp. But we have no such retaliatory intentions. To say that the Allied countries want to destroy the German people is absurd and malicious and can only be used for domestic propaganda. The German people must know that the responsibility for prolonging the war and causing suffering is not only borne by the German authorities, but also by the German people. They must know that the Allied countries' desire for a truly humane, just, and Christian solution is by no means satisfied by empty words that have been proven to be worthless by past experience. The methods adopted by the Hitler government are always a danger to the independence of the weak countries in Europe and always a great threat to the moral standards on which the entire Western civilization is based. The countries of North and South America have expressed particular disgust at this. President Roosevelt recently said in his speech, "Only the union of those who seek light and peace everywhere can stop the evil forces." I very much agree with this, but I have one thing to add. If the forces of justice are to prevail, we must sacrifice our blood and money to achieve this noble goal. We are now united with the determination to achieve this goal, and we have the support of the entire people of the Empire and the strength and determination of France." (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<h3>Eighteen Countries Respond to the League of Nations Appeal</h3>
<p>Geneva: The Secretary-General of the League of Nations, Mr. Avenol, sent telegrams to member states and non-member states in December of last year, in accordance with the resolution of the League of Nations General Assembly (passed on December 14), appealing for assistance to Finland. So far, the governments of 18 countries have submitted replies (including 10 countries in the Americas). The reply from the government of the South African Republic stated, "We are discussing with the Red Cross how to provide humanitarian assistance to Finland." The reply from the Australian Federal Government stated, "We have decided to donate £10,000 to the Finnish government for Red Cross expenses and to allow fundraising throughout the Australian Federal Territory to assist the Finnish Red Cross." The reply from the Brazilian government stated, "Our government will fully support any fundraising campaign launched by private individuals." It is important to note that 12 member states that voted in favor of this resolution at that time have not yet replied. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<h3>German Birth Rate Exceeds That of Britain and France</h3>
<p>Berlin: According to a report released by the German Statistics Bureau, the number of children born in Germany in 1939 was one million more than in France. According to reliable statistics, in 1939, Germany, excluding the "Eastern District," had a total of 1,640,000 births, while France had 612,000 births and Britain had 740,000 births. In other words, in the past year, the population increase in Germany exceeded the combined increase in Britain and France by 300,000. (Hai Tong News Agency, 10th)</p>

<h3>Yang Shoutong, Puppet Magistrate of Wuxi, Assassinated</h3>
<p>Japanese Troops Close City for Search</p>
<p>Wuxi Correspondent: Since the puppet magistrate Qin Lianggong was transferred to the "Renovation Government" to serve as a puppet councilor, his vacancy was filled by Yang Shoutong. For more than a year, Yang has been trying to please the Japanese in every possible way and has won the favor of the Japanese side. At about 4 p.m. on the 9th of this month, Yang and two guards went out of the puppet office. After walking a few steps, they were suddenly attacked by several young and strong men who opened fire indiscriminately. Yang was seriously injured and died before he could be treated. Afterwards, the Japanese military police and the puppet police urgently closed the city gates and searched house to house, but there were no results. The city has now been closed for two days, and the outside of the city is also very strict. The searches at the station are even tighter. Regardless of gender, people must undress for inspection. Since this incident occurred, Japanese and puppet officials have been extremely panicked.</p>
<h3>The Tragic Situation of Japanese Bombing in Henan Province: Zheng County, Luoyang, Xinyang, and Nanyang Suffer the Greatest Damage; Remote Villages Also Unable to Avoid Japanese Bombing</h3>
<p>Luoyang Dispatch: Since the War of Resistance, the Japanese army has dispatched a large number of air forces to bomb undefended Chinese cities, resulting in ruins everywhere and the suffering of the people. Not only have important cities been bombed, but even remote villages have been unable to avoid it. The extent of the damage is difficult to describe. The following is a summary of the damage suffered by Henan Province since the War of Resistance and the situation of air defense measures:</p>
<p>A. The Rampage of Japanese Aircraft in Various Regions of Henan Province</p>
<p>(1) The Situation of Bombing in Important Cities: 1. Kaifeng: In March of the previous year, during the Battle of Xuzhou, the Japanese army, while attacking Kaifeng, dispatched a large number of aircraft to bomb it extensively. It is estimated that Kaifeng alone suffered a total of sixteen bombings from the beginning of the War of Resistance until its fall. In particular, in May of the millennium, alarms were frequent, and tiles and pottery were destroyed in the Nanguan area. 2. Xinyang: Xinyang is a barrier to southern Henan and a gateway to Wuhan. In October of the year before last, the Japanese army launched a full-scale land and air offensive, attempting to cut off the Pinghan (Beijing-Hankou) Railway to capture Wuhan. Therefore, among the important cities in this province, besides Zheng County, Luoyang, and Nanyang, Xinyang suffered the most air raids. It is estimated that from the beginning of the War of Resistance until before its fall, it was bombed by Japanese aircraft twenty-two times. 3. Nanyang: Nanyang is an important town in southwestern Henan and also a bombing target for the Japanese army. In May of last year, the Japanese army, from Hubei Province, followed the Zaoshu River to harass Xinye Tanghe, attempting to capture Nanyang in order to threaten Xiangfan and Longdong. Thanks to the brave Chinese soldiers who fought hard for dozens of days, they successfully repelled the strong enemy. The Japanese army, due to military failure, vented its anger on innocent people. It is estimated that Nanyang has been bombed twenty-four times since the War of Resistance. 4. Zheng County and Luoyang: Zheng County is located at the intersection of the Pinghan and Longhai Railways, serving as a hub for the northern provinces. Its strategic importance far exceeds that of Kaifeng. Luoyang controls Hulao in the east and Hangu Pass in the west, and has always been a strategic location for military strategists. Therefore, the two cities of Zheng and Luo have long been under the Japanese army's attempt to occupy them. Knowing that the Yellow River is a natural barrier and the Chinese side's defense is tight, making it impossible to cross secretly, they had to use air power to kill and injure innocent civilians and destroy prosperous cities. Therefore, since the War of Resistance, Zheng and Luo have suffered the most air raids in the province, and the number of civilian casualties is the highest.</p>
<p>(2) The Situation of Bombing in Cities, Towns, and Villages: It has been found that since last year, the targets of Japanese aircraft bombing have gradually expanded from cities to remote villages. Taking Lin County, which has already fallen, as an example, it has been bombed a total of eleven times. Other examples include Huayuankou, Jingshui, and Dongzhao Village in Zheng County; Shahe and Jiezhong in Tanghe County; Wadian and Yuantan in Nanyang County; Yusi in Meng County; Zicheng and Shanhe Bailan in Jiyuan County; Jinjiaqiao in Tongbai County; Gu County, Ping氏 (unclear), Huiyu Town in Shan County; Guodi Town and Panlong Town in Guanxiang County; and Tiexie Baihe and other villages in Mengjin County, which have also been subjected to air raids. Taking Pingmin Town in Tongbai County as an example, on May 2nd of last year, eighteen Japanese aircraft arrived in batches, dropping 150 bombs, with flames spreading everywhere and people in panic. Although the above examples are not large-scale bombings, they demonstrate their tactics of disrupting local tranquility and harming innocent old, weak, women, and children.</p>

<p>(Hong Kong, 9th, United Press) The Hong Kong-Shanghai Interport Football Match, which has been suspended for two sessions, will be held in Shanghai during the Spring Festival. The Hong Kong representative team, led by Da Gao Shan Nu, will make a short trip. The Hong Kong representative team was announced by the General Association yesterday (8th). A total of 15 people were selected, four of whom were soldiers (Marx Han, Schmohr, Hershey, Burras). The captain is Da Gao Shan Nu, and the leader and manager is the General Association member Ju Bi. The whole team is scheduled to travel to Shanghai in the first week of next month. All players have obtained special permission from the Hong Kong government to take leave, including the players currently serving in the military. The schedule for the interport competition has also been determined to be three matches. In addition to the official Hong Kong-Shanghai match, the other two matches are likely to be the Hong Kong team against the Shanghai Chinese United team and the Shanghai Military United team. The Hong Kong team's lineup is as follows:</p>
<p>Shanghai Has Not Yet Received It According to Mr. Spike, Secretary of the Shanghai Westerners Football Club, although it has been rumored for several weeks that Hong Kong has accepted Shanghai's invitation, the Shanghai club has not yet received a formal reply from Hong Kong. According to the Hong Kong Association, its formal notification acknowledging acceptance of the invitation has long been sent, but the Shanghai side has not yet received it. Mr. Spike also pointed out that the contact with the Polish side for the interport competition was still in October last year, and there has been no exchange of documents or letters since then. He hopes that the misunderstanding will be delayed by the postal and telecommunications aspects, and he hopes that he will receive a formal letter from Hong Kong in the near future.</p>
<h3>Little Bears Lost to Qianghua; Maihong Defeated Military Officers in West Qing Basketball Last Night</h3>
<p>In the West Qing Basketball Class A match last night, Qianghua played against Little Bears. After losing to Hualian, Qianghua tried to cheer up. Although the subsequent Saiqing was in Shanghai, its strength was not affected. Yesterday, it controlled the whole game, causing the Little Bears, who had won every game, to be captured. Hualian's grievances for being defeated by the Little Bears were also replaced by Qianghua, which can be called a happy event. After the contact, Shao Liao scored a free throw to open the record. Jinghu Wen Kui and Shao Liao also scored in succession, and Qianghua quickly led with seven to zero. The Little Bears quickly chased up and became seven to five, only two points behind. This was the closest situation in yesterday's game. Qianghua aggressively attacked, and Xu Zhangzai scored again, adding nine points. At the beginning, Qianghua led with fifteen to nine. After changing sides, Wen Kui and Jiang Long both made contributions, making it thirty-three to twenty. The Little Bears launched a desperate counterattack, and Qiang Tuolie and Tao Bolunji each scored three points, making it thirty-six to twenty-four, twelve points behind. At that time, Wen Kui was fouled out of the game, but the victory was already set. Finally, Jiang Long broke through the basket, and the final score was thirty-six to twenty-six. Qianghua captured the Little Bears alive. In the same group, Maihong defeated Military Officers forty to twenty-six. In the first half, twenty-four to fifteen, Maihong also took the lead. In addition, there was another Class B game where Skull lost to Giant forty to twenty-six, and Military Officers defeated by twenty-four to fifteen in the first half, also Maihong took the lead.

<h3>Securities: Foreign Debt Soars, Domestic Debt Steady</h3>
<p>The securities black market yesterday showed a recovery after weakness. Bulls seemed to have a gradually growing sense of satisfaction. Large investors were seen more selling than buying, or buying and then reselling. After a long rise, a slight correction is a very reasonable trend. Yesterday morning, demand for No. 4 (Stock) at 35 and No. 58 remained high, and Da Feng also absorbed a considerable amount, but at the same time, sellers outnumbered buyers. United, United Profit, Sin Faith, Ruen Li, Da Tong, and Heng Fu either liquidated long positions or created new short positions, and their momentum was strong. The market price recovered after a period of weakness. Category C stock prices approached the 50-yuan mark. In the afternoon, No. 35 stock prices fluctuated inconsistently. Nos. 11 and 38 were still being sought after. There was demand for Ding Kang stock yesterday, with sellers mostly taking profits. Jiu Feng and Ju Xin also sold off their holdings, and the market price rose slightly again. Category C stocks again approached the 50-yuan mark, fluctuating within and outside the "Guan" (price level), but ultimately failing to break through the new high of 50 yuan and 3 jiao. The market may consolidate further, awaiting new catalysts. The market price ultimately closed slightly better by 5 fen and 1 jiao. The total transaction volume was approximately 1.2 million yuan. A summary table is provided below:</p>
<p>London, 9th - Today, Chinese foreign debt listed on the market continued to surge. The high-end Anglo-French and Consolidation (both issued in London) each rose by 5 pounds, with Anglo-French at 50 pounds and Consolidation at 45 pounds. Sino-French US dollar bonds rose by 3 pounds, to 51 pounds. The other three types each rose by 2 pounds, with Anglo-German (issued in London) at 60 pounds, Crisp loan at 30 pounds, and Fix at 12 pounds. Among the high-end railway bonds, the Beining, Longhai, and Guangzhou-Kowloon railways were flat, while the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway alone rose by 2 pounds, to 20 pounds. The others each rose by 1 pound, with Daocheng at 16 pounds, and Huguang non-German and German at 18 and 16 pounds respectively, and Jinpu both at 15 pounds.</p>
<p>It is said that the rise in foreign debt is related to peace and the stabilization of finance, according to reports from this city. However, peace is impossible given the current situation, and how to stabilize finance is not something that can be predicted in the short term. The rise in London foreign debt is ultimately somewhat related to current events, but the answer has not yet been revealed.</p>
<h3>HSBC Bank Dividend</h3>
<p>Total of 5 pounds for the year, Yie Song distributes 24 yuan</p>
<p>HSBC Bank received a telegram from its Hong Kong head office yesterday stating that the final dividend for this year will be 2 pounds and 10 shillings per share (subject to income tax), combined with the interim dividend of 2 shillings and 10 pence, totaling 5 pounds per share for the year (subject to income tax). In addition to the dividend distribution, 300,000 Hong Kong dollars will be allocated to the depreciation reserve for business properties, and the remaining 3,411,000 Hong Kong dollars will be carried forward to the next year.

The final dividend for 1939 has been decided at 20 yuan in national currency per share, combined with the interim dividend of 4 yuan in national currency per share, totaling 24 yuan in national currency. An extraordinary shareholders' meeting will be held after this meeting to discuss voluntary liquidation matters. It is understood that each share of the company can be distributed as 9 shares of Union Dockyards. The dockyard property will be distributed after it is sold.</p>
<h3>Stocks Frequently Rise</h3>
<p>In stock trading, 40 shares of Qing Feng Textile Factory were traded yesterday at a price of 52 yuan, up more than 1 yuan from the previous day.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the stock market at the Public Brokers' Association opened very strong. The prices of all rubber stocks and most industrial stocks recovered much of what they had lost the previous day. Subsequently, as profit-taking re-emerged, the stocks suffered again. However, the decline soon stopped, and the market stabilized slightly. The underlying trend was firm. Shares of the Four Seas Insurance Company rose to 11 yuan, and shares of Yie Song Dockyard were traded at 235 yuan, which were the two major highlights in the industrial stock trading yesterday.</p>
<p>London, 9th - Today, the listed prices of British-owned Far East companies' stocks mostly rose and fell less. The Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Insurance shares rose 1 pound and 5 shillings, to 24 pounds and 15 shillings. HSBC Bank's UK-registered shares rose 2 and a half pounds, to 87 and a half pounds. Hong Kong-registered shares rose 3 pounds, to 90 pounds. Kulai Grampian Rubber shares fell 7 and a half pence, to 21 shillings and 10 and a half pence. The rest were flat.</p>
<h3>Finance: Speculation and Wait-and-See, Gold Market Neither Prosperous nor Disappointing</h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot gold black market situation saw little change, with only small fluctuations. Trading decreased accordingly. However, a certain gold firm continued to sell off, while money changers occasionally absorbed from customers, resulting in a small decrease of two yuan. The morning opening price rose by ten yuan to four thousand and ninety yuan, due to tight foreign exchange rates and purchases by money changers. Subsequently, as the foreign exchange market suddenly loosened, a certain gold firm started to sell off, and a certain money changer also released holdings on behalf of many clients, resulting in a drop to a low price of four thousand and seventy-six yuan. However, at this time, the foreign exchange market suddenly tightened again, and securities firms took the opportunity to buy in, and at the same time, a certain bank also absorbed on behalf of its customers, which pushed the price up to a high of four thousand and ninety-four yuan. Subsequently, as foreign currencies returned to strength, many profit-takers came to sell off, and gold firms again sold off a certain amount, so the closing price at noon was only four thousand and eighty-two yuan. In the afternoon, the market became even quieter due to the lack of foreign exchange trading. Only the securities firms made a few further sales, slightly suppressing the price. The closing price was four thousand and seventy-eight yuan. The total trading volume for the day was only about a thousand taels. Jewelry gold at gold shops remained stable, and customs duties also remained stable.</p>
<p>Spot Gold Down Another Two Yuan</p>
<p>Since the market opened in the morning, with tight foreign exchange rates, a certain money changer took the lead in raising prices to buy in, and the opening price rose by ten yuan. The money changer bought 30 taels from the gold shop at four thousand and ninety yuan. Shortly afterwards, the foreign exchange rate suddenly showed signs of easing, and market sentiment deteriorated. A certain gold firm immediately started to sell, and another money changer also sold off a lot. Most buyers were on the sidelines. Before long, the price fell by 14 yuan. The money changer sold 20 taels to the gold shop at four thousand and seventy-six yuan. Then, with the securities firms seeing a bargain and buying in, and the foreign exchange market showing signs of softening again, coupled with a certain money changer and a certain bank also buying in on behalf of their customers, the price gradually rose by eighteen yuan. The securities firm bought 10 taels from the gold firm at four thousand and ninety-four yuan. After that, the foreign exchange rate returned to its previous level, and the securities firms took the opportunity to sell at a high price, and a certain gold firm also sold off again, so the price gradually declined. The money changer sold 20 taels to the gold shop at four thousand and eighty yuan. Then, the money changers traded 20 taels among themselves at four thousand and eighty-two yuan as the noon closing price. The trend in the afternoon was flat and weak. First, the money changers traded 10 taels among themselves at four thousand and eighty-one yuan, down one yuan from the noon closing price. Later, at half past two, the securities firms came to sell again, bringing the price down another three yuan. The securities firm sold 20 taels to the money changer at four thousand and seventy-eight yuan as the evening closing price. As a result, the price continued to fall by two yuan compared with the previous day. The price fluctuated by 18 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of gold from cash gold shops was a few yuan higher than the spot gold price, and the buying price was 20 yuan lower. The margin gold price was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price, and there was little trading.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Unchanged All Day</p>
<p>The selling price of jewelry gold per tael has not changed. Datongxing still quoted 410 yuan, and the price of new firms was the same as the previous price. The buying price was about 15 yuan lower.</p>
<p>Recent Gold Prices in Ningbo</p>
<p>Since the National Government announced the gold and silver regulations, the Ningbo jewelry industry has stopped issuing gold jewelry. People who want jewelry can only exchange for silver items. At present, Ningbo jewelry stores such as Tianbaocheng, Fangzicheng, and Xinfengxiang have all established "Central Bank Gold Collection Agency" outlets to collect gold at the listed price. Although the price per tael is 360 yuan, the black market price has already reached 380 or 390 yuan. People believe that the prices are similar to those in Shanghai, and it is too dangerous to bring jewelry to Shanghai, because the export of gold jewelry is limited to one Shanghai tael. Therefore, they all exchange in Ningbo. (Tao)</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Fluctuates Within a Narrow Range</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no changes in HSBC's listed prices. The black market prices of British and American exchange rates fluctuated within a narrow range, showing a slight tightening trend in the calm market. However, the end result was neither particularly good nor bad. At the beginning of the morning, the continued rise in American and British exchange rates caused the market to show a tight British and flat American trend, with prices at 4 pence 859375 and 8 yuan. Subsequently, the Mitsui Bank of Japan took the lead in buying, and because the supply from foreign banks was very weak, the prices tightened sharply to 4 pence 8125 and 7 yuan 90625. Later, due to a sudden sell-off from Hong Kong and the fact that Sassoon, exporters, and Shanghai Chinese firms were also releasing spot goods to each other, and it was also heard that HSBC was also selling, the prices once turned firmer, with the American exchange rate breaking the 8-yuan mark, reaching 8 yuan and 3125. The British pound also rose to 4 pence 875. However, due to foreign firms buying distant-month American exchange rates at low prices, and Chinese merchants also slightly following suit, the prices tightened again, shrinking to 4 pence 84375 and 7 yuan 9375. Later, buyers were satisfied, and American banks, Datong and other banks still had ample supply, so the market returned to flatness. Until the closing, it was similar to the morning opening. As a result, the British exchange rate tightened by 0.015625, while the American exchange rate showed no difference. The underlying trend of futures was no different from that of spot prices.</p>
<p>Sassoon Sells British and American Exchange</p>
<p>At the beginning of the morning, London telegraphs reported gains of 0.0625 for both near and far months, while New York silver prices remained flat, London spot gold remained unchanged, the exchange rate of the British pound against the US dollar rose by half a point, the exchange rate against Shanghai rose by 0.125, and the exchange rate against France rose by 50 centimes. The exchange rate of the US dollar against the British pound rose by 0.0875, the exchange rate against Shanghai remained unchanged, and the exchange rate against France rose by 0.0625. The central government's listed prices remained the same. The bank's opening spot selling prices were 4 pence 859375 for the British pound and 8 yuan for the American dollar, which was 0.015625 tighter for the British pound and flat for the American dollar compared to the previous day, due to the continued rise in exchange rates. After the opening, Mitsui took the lead in buying, and the supply from foreign banks was very weak, so the market situation suddenly weakened. At 9:15, the British pound had shrunk to 4 pence 8125, and the American dollar had tightened to 7 yuan 90625. Fortunately, a sell-off from Hong Kong came in time, and soon Sassoon and exporters also released spot British and American exchange rates, and Shanghai Chinese firms also sold spot American exchange rates, and it was also heard that HSBC was also selling at that time, so the position suddenly felt abundant, and the situation gradually eased. When HSBC's listed prices were announced, they did not move, and the silver equalization tax was announced to be up by half a point. After this, until 9:39, the British pound had returned to 4 pence 875, and the American dollar had also returned to 8 yuan 03135. Later, due to foreign firms buying in at low prices, and Chinese merchants also slightly following suit, the sellers gradually decreased, and the trend showed a slight tightening again. At 10:15, the British pound reached 4 pence 84375, and the American dollar reached 7 yuan 9375. Then, with fewer buyers and American banks such as Datong still having a good supply, the market soon returned to flatness. After this, the buying and selling wait-and-see trend became stable. Until the closing, the bank's spot selling prices were 4 pence 859275 for the British pound and 8 yuan for the American dollar. This month's British pound was 4 pence 84375, and the American dollar was 7 yuan 9685. As a result, the current and futures British pounds both tightened by 0.015625 compared to the previous day, while the American dollar did not show any gains or losses. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Shanghai Exchange Rate Rises by Four Yuan</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 10th - This morning, the foreign exchange market opened steadily. The spot British exchange rate remained unchanged, and the forward rate loosened by 0.03125, to 1 shilling, 2 pence and 90625. The spot American exchange rate loosened by 0.0625, to 24 yuan 5625. The spot Shanghai exchange rate rose by three yuan, to 304 yuan. The spot Japanese exchange rate loosened slightly by 0.025, to 103 yuan 75.

<p>Tianjin British and American Currencies Both Contract</p>
<p>Tianjin, 10th - The foreign exchange market was sluggish at the opening this morning. The spot British exchange rate tightened by 0.021875, to 4 pence 0625. The spot American exchange rate contracted by 0.03125, to 7 yuan 625. The Shanghai exchange rate rose by two yuan, to 304 yuan. The "Joint Currency" black market continued to rise by 0.5 yuan, to 96 yuan 0.5 yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currencies Fluctuate with Softness</h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreign currencies moved within a narrower range and tended to fluctuate. Supply and demand for British and American gold pounds were scarce, and the market was stable. The supply of gold certificates was relatively abundant midway, and as a result, the American yuan certificates saw no gains or losses, and the evening price was still 12 yuan 6 jiao. British gold certificates rose slightly, mainly due to the strength of the pound price. Demand for Hong Kong notes was slightly strong, and the market was slightly firm. Absorption of French francs, Singapore dollars, Dutch guilders, and Annam piasters was not strong, and the market was soft. The supply of "Kantou" (Cantonese) notes increased, and the market price was slightly lower. The supply and demand for Japanese gold certificates were balanced, and the market fluctuated with softness. The evening price was 1 yuan, 6 fen and 4 li. The supply of Korean notes increased, and the market was weak. The evening price was 1 yuan and 5 fen. Yesterday's market prices saw British gold certificates rise by 1 jiao, Hong Kong notes rise by 1 fen, French franc notes fall by 2 li, Singapore notes fall by 2 jiao, Dutch notes fall by 1 jiao, Annam notes fall by 7 fen, Kantou notes fall by 5 fen, and the prices of other currencies remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Grains: Saigon Rice Prices Slightly Looser, Japonica Tip Rice Fluctuation Very Small</h3>
<p>After the japonica tip rice market rose again, the opening trend continued to be tight. General merchants and traders were still unwilling to sell easily, and the bidding prices were quite high. If foreign rice is still the main source, No. 1 Saigon rice once reached 37 yuan, and No. 2 Saigon rice also reached 35 yuan and 8 jiao. Other early and late rice also opened at over 37 yuan, but local shops became slack as soon as they moved, and dared not buy in too much. Because the rice-selling business from public sources will soon begin, there are bound to be many effects due to various reasons. As a result, the trend suddenly turned dull at noon, and there were few inquiries in both retail and wholesale markets, so the market was difficult to maintain and showed weakness. Although the sources from various places were still scarce, it was ultimately difficult to reverse market sentiment. The actual selling price of No. 1 Saigon rice was 36 yuan and a half, No. 2 Saigon rice was 25 yuan and 3 jiao, and early and late rice was 37 yuan. The market fluctuated by only 1 or 2 jiao throughout the day.</p>
<p>The source of foreign rice is continuous. In addition to the continuous shipping from Hong Kong, Saigon orders are also being shipped one after another. Yesterday's telegraph reported that foreign prices were slightly looser. There were many batches of No. 1 and broken rice under negotiation. Most are still awaiting confirmation. Yesterday, only 200 tons of No. 1 Saigon rice were agreed upon, with a price of 42 yuan and a half. The intention to sell the original return packages was slightly looser. Yesterday's market had already reached 44 yuan. Spot goods have been blocked from being shipped out, market sentiment has returned to stability, and the market has also rebounded by 5 or 6 jiao. Saigon opened at 36 yuan and 7 jiao, broken rice at 32 yuan and 8 jiao, Tokyo rice at 33 yuan 1 and 2 jiao, and secondary grades were priced accordingly. The market had not seen a large squeeze for a long time, and yesterday it also sold out at 32 yuan and 8 jiao.</p>
<p>Another report: It was previously reported that a certain French steamer brought a large batch of foreign rice from Saigon. It has now been confirmed that it is the "Adous" of the French Fire Wheel Company, which carried a total of 28,200 bags, and is expected to be imported this morning and docked at the Gonghexiang Wharf in Hongkou for unloading.</p>
<h3>Flour is Firm ——Wheat Also Rises——</h3>
<p>Flour: Since the factory prices have risen to 9 yuan and jiao, the price of wheat has also become expensive, reaching over 16 yuan. Moreover, due to the extreme shortage of ship space for foreign wheat, only one ship ordered by Fufeng Factory has been confirmed. The rest have not been properly delivered, so market sentiment is even more optimistic. Except for supplying their own sales, the factories are unwilling to sell to outside traders, because the difference between the factory price and the trader price was as much as half a yuan in the previous two days. At present, the factory price has increased by 4 jiao, and the trader price must also be increased accordingly, resulting in the invisible stagnation of trader sales. Altogether, only this company, Heng and traders from the interior transacted a total of 15,000 to 16,000 bags. It is reported that the return goods' "Green Cannon Car" is close to the upper yuan mark, but there has been no formal transaction. The flour from the Japanese factories has gradually improved, and speculators are flocking to it. The price of Phoenix brand in January is 9 yuan 6 jiao to 6 jiao half. There are many buyers in February, and it is close to the 10 yuan mark.</p>
<p>Wheat: The market was also firm yesterday. Since the factory's purchase price reached the 10-yuan mark, market sentiment was excited. Market hoarders did not mind the high prices and secretly absorbed them. Most of them were sold to Japanese factories, and the price was 2 to 3 jiao higher than the normal price. Therefore, the purchase price of Chinese factories had to be driven up by the Japanese factories. Yesterday, the goods' side planned to raise the price again, but the factories did not accept it. As a result, Fufeng and Fuxin factories bought one car of ordinary wheat each, and the price was still yuan.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains: Soybean Sales Market Lively</h3>
<p>The price of soybeans continued to rise by 2 or 3 jiao, and the overall situation was supported by the sales market. Therefore, the underlying trend was firm. Yesterday, Nanyang and local street warehouses and oil factories all inquired. According to statistics, 6 or 7 cars of Dingjiazhou beans were traded at a price of 18 yuan 8 jiao to 5 jiao, and high-quality beans were 19 yuan. Four cars of Wuhu beans were traded at a price of 18 yuan 4 jiao to 18 yuan 1 jiao. More than 2,000 bags of Nanjing beans were traded at a price of 18 yuan 3 jiao to 17 yuan 9 jiao and a half. Three cars of Liuhe beans were traded at a price of 7 yuan 8 jiao. More than 400 bags of Jiangbei beans were traded at a price of 17 yuan 6 jiao and a half. More than 200 bags of Taicang beans were traded at a price of 18 yuan 3 jiao, and more than 200 bags of Pinghu Doudou beans were traded at a price of 21 yuan 2 jiao to 20 yuan 02 jiao. More than 100 bags of Chongming sand yellow beans were traded at a price of 18 yuan 6 jiao to 2 jiao. In addition, 350 bags of beans came from Beisha yesterday.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: It is Difficult to Expect the Yarn Market to Revive</h3>
<p>The yarn market is calm, but the trend is still weak and listless. Although Northern traders purchase for domestic sales of yarn, they are all 10-count coarse yarn. The sales of 20-count yarn is particularly slow, so market sentiment is still difficult to revive. Moreover, the 20-count Double Horse factory's shipment of 5,600 bags due in January has already arrived, and it is necessary to advance money to ship the goods. In this regard, a batch of chips has been added to the market, so although the bulls are tightening and not letting go, some have the idea of shorting distant-month yarn. Therefore, the competition between the two sides is particularly fierce, and it is unknown who will win.</p>
<p>At the opening of the spot yarn market this morning, it was heard that foreign exchange had shrunk slightly, and the atmosphere in the market was slightly strong. The opening price of 20-count Double Horse yarn was 726 yuan, but buyers were not enthusiastic, and the market situation was increasingly hesitant. After a while, it fell slightly to 723 yuan. Soon, as the bulls came to buy in again, it rose again by several yuan to 727 yuan, but the transaction was not strong. It was found that 1,955 bags were traded in half a day, and the price of 20-count Double Horse yarn rose by 5 jiao. The rest were about the same as the previous day. The amount of buying and selling by each party is as follows:</p>
<p>Same trade 1,090, Tianjin 535, Ningbo 45, Hong Kong 70, Inland 215, Total 1,955</p>
<p>Cotton Only Traded Among Peers</p>
<p>The transaction of local cotton is still improving, but it is all among peers buying and selling each other. Because the factories have difficulty seeing the price of yarn rise and have even seen it fall, they have not done anything about the bales. In addition, the overseas cotton market is also in a fluctuating trend, and the foreign exchange trend is loosening, so market sentiment is firm but with some softness. As for the source of cotton from northern Jiangsu, there are 1,567 bales of Tonghua (ordinary cotton), 1,590 bales of Changyinsha cotton, and 686 bales from Beisha. The current cotton transaction situation is recorded on the left: Fireweed bale, 163.50, Same trade buys in 230 bales. Great Zhongji, 215.00, also 170 pieces, also 214.00, also 274 pieces. Firewood frame, 166.00, also 140 pieces. South Thai, 164.75, also 58 bales. Great Zhongji, 222.25, also 194 pieces. Fire engine, 162.50, also 320 bales. Tongzhou, 175.50, also 180 bales. Lower sand America, 186.00, also 98 bales. Sand mixed ocean, 178.00, also 140 bales. Sanyu flower, 194.50, also 180 bales. Great Zhongji, 114.45, also 201 bales.</p>
<p>Another report on the market price of foreign cotton: The New York cotton market was weaker yesterday due to the pressure of mass selling and overseas merchants' selling, but it was still relatively firm. As a result, the closing price fell by 5 or 6 points compared with the previous day, and the distant month fell by 9 points. Indian cotton, including forecasts, rose by more than one rupee. Egyptian cotton fell by 3.5 pounds. Liverpool fell by 10 pence.</p>
<p>Trading of foreign cotton in Shanghai is very quiet. It has been very dull in recent days. All parties are uncertain about the foreign exchange rate, not knowing whether it will be loose or tight. Due to the cumbersome procedures of spot trading among peers, it is easier to buy New York distant-month cotton, so many have switched to this industry. The factory price with a 美匯 rate of 8 yuan is as follows: 20-count US cotton, Mitchell, 228.85, also lower grade, 224.70; 32-count, 240.00, also lower grade, 222.00; 42-count, 245.00, also lower grade, 237.7.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Coarse White Gradually Loosening</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw a downstream trend. The association's price for spot 24 coarse white was 56 yuan and a half at the local warehouse, down one yuan. The price of newly arrived imported sugar at other warehouses dropped by nearly a yuan to several jiao, to 57 yuan to 56 yuan and 8 jiao. Old goods were 56 yuan and 2 jiao. Transshipment goods were down 5 jiao, to 45 yuan and a half. Taikoo refined white sugar was slightly looser. Eastern warehouse B mark was 58 yuan and a half, western warehouse was 58 yuan and 8 jiao, CW mark was 58 yuan and a half, CX mark was yuan 18 yuan 3 jiao, DY mark was 58 yuan, and HX Ka was 57 yuan and a half. The H mark coarse sugar also fell by half a yuan, to 42 yuan and a half. Dutch coarse sugar was 45 yuan. Mumian white sugar was down one yuan, Zhenji No. 1 was 56 yuan and a half, No. 1 was 56 yuan, local No. 1 bingtang (rock sugar) was 67 yuan and a half, and Jingming bingtang was 69 yuan. The price of the 50 bags of Huizhou secondary white sugar opened by the domestic sugar mill was 51 yuan and 8 jiao to 52 yuan. Although the price of Diaoqing was called 46 yuan, the traders were on the sidelines and did not buy. Today, 2,000 bags of sugar are being shipped to Ningbo.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth Ostensibly Loose, Actually Tight</h3>
<p>The Nanyang Route is Still the Most Prosperous</p>
<p>The cloth market was firm yesterday. Trader routes and overseas actual demand were sustained. Although the foreign exchange market was fluctuating, the hoarders' attitude was hesitant. The market showed an ostensibly loose but actually tight situation, with fluctuations of slightly one or two jiao. Shenxin Fugui fine cloth once fell to 22 yuan, but then rebounded to 22 yuan 2 jiao half to five jiao. The selling prices of Jardine Matheson and Linchang of British firms were the most attractive, because most of the products from the two factories are now directly sold overseas. The Zhejiang and Jiangxi traders also ordered by brand, with the Zhejiang and Jiangxi traders buying more than 200 pieces of coarse cloth and bleached cloth yesterday. The Hong Kong and Nanyang traders bought more than 10,000 pieces of fine twill, satin, colored cloth, and bleached cloth. The local street traded more than 300 pieces of coarse cloth, fine cloth, twill poplin, and bleached cloth. The Tianjin traders bought more than 100 pieces of coarse twill, blue cloth, and poplin. In addition, there are 560 pieces of cloth being shipped to Ningbo today.</p>

<h3>The Unveiling of Human Body Secrets: Where Does the Omnipotence of Intelligence Come From? Now There's a Method for Love and Happiness!</h3>
<p>— By American Medical Doctor Yao Chong, Specialist in Venereal Diseases, and Physician Zhan Nianhe</p>
<p>(Clinic) 2nd Floor, China Trust Company, Intersection of Beijing Road and Sichuan Road (Time) 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM, Closed on Sundays</p>
<p>Recently, some people are surprised by the discovery of the secrets of human reproductive function! In fact, there are people who have studied this deeply and contributed great inventions to humankind. Anyone who has read physiology or zoology knows that our bodies, in addition to skin, bones, blood, and flesh, also have something more precious; namely, nerves and endocrine secretions within the reproductive glands. The nervous system includes various types such as sensory, transmitting, cerebrum, cerebellum, spinal cord, and sexual nerves, all composed of nerve cells that are connected to each other. Therefore, the nervous system is like a network, densely distributed throughout the body, specializing in the functions of sensation and response. But the nervous system relies on nourishment, which is the endocrine fluid of the reproductive glands.</p>
<p>Reproductive gland endocrine secretions are a type of ductless gland. They are the sum of the pituitary gland, pineal gland, adrenal and adrenal glands, testicular glands, etc. During the period of spring arousal, these glands are particularly developed, so intelligence suddenly opens up, the body develops, the face shows rosy color, and the voice is loud… Therefore, this type of gland not only presides over reproductive function, but also assists in development, nourishes nerves, adjusts metabolism, and enhances resistance; especially when stimulated by certain special environments, it can excite nerves, concentrate the mind, exert extraordinary talents and abilities, and become a very intelligent person. The emotions of joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness, expressed outwardly, become passionate, righteous, and literary individuals! Intelligence is the most essential thing for us humans. In the past, during the Chu-Han contention, Xiang Yu and Liu Bang fought to the death. At that time, Liu Bang's military strength was inferior to Xiang Yu's, so he replied to Xiang Yu: "I do not want to fight with you in strength, but I want to fight with you in intelligence." As a result, Liu Bang eventually established the Han dynasty. This clear fact in history shows that intelligence is indeed omnipotent.</p>
<p>Since the interaction and importance of reproductive gland endocrine secretions and the nervous system are so significant, men must cherish themselves and strive to maintain their health. In the unfortunate event of early ignorance and curiosity, committing masturbation, nocturnal emission, early marriage and indulgence, or excessive worry and stimulation, which damages the nervous system or depletes the endocrine fluid of the reproductive glands, then symptoms such as brain weakness and forgetfulness, insomnia and palpitations, back pain, kidney failure and impotence, premature ejaculation, incomplete development, and infertility will be numerous. Such weak men not only face a bleak future due to their declining energy, but also in the arena of love, or in the sexual life between husband and wife, they will inevitably be abandoned by women and hated by wives and concubines, falling into the most tragic situation in the human world!</p>
<p>The only method for treatment and prevention is to quickly take the "Reproductin," a preparation made from the hormones of healthy animal reproductive glands, as it is the most effective remedy for these conditions. This remedy, since its invention by Professor Stenah, a master of physiology and medicine in Germany, after a lifetime of arduous experiments, has shocked the medical community around the world, as it is believed to be a new method for preventing disease, prolonging life, and rejuvenating oneself. When I was studying effective treatments for venereal diseases in the United States, I also used this remedy for continuous experiments. Among thousands of venereal disease patients, more than 90% who took this remedy recovered completely. The recorded efficacy of this remedy is unmatched by any other. It is indeed because of its precious ingredients, excellent manufacturing, reliable efficacy, and great restorative power that it surpasses any similar preparation. Taking it will generate semen and tonify the kidneys, strengthen the brain and activate blood circulation within one day and night. It is especially valuable to take it continuously, as it further promotes development, nourishes semen and blood, nourishes nerves, and regulates metabolism. The aforementioned symptoms will surely be cured in a short period. Regular consumption by middle-aged and elderly people will prolong life and rejuvenate oneself. However, those suffering from nocturnal emission must also take the effective remedy for nocturnal emission, "Hemitol's Semen-Consolidating Tablets" (available at major Chinese and Western pharmacies such as China-West Five Continents Hua Mei and Sino-British, priced at two yuan per box), to stop leakage, which will be even more effective.</p>
<p>Beautification</p>
<h3>A New Method for Breast Development</h3>
<p>— American Medical Doctor Yao Chongpei</p>
<p>Methods for female beautification are almost more strenuous than those for men, because women have special physiological characteristics, such as menstruation and pregnancy. Therefore, for a woman to achieve the standard of beauty, she must follow the following methods to maintain it for a long time. According to the research of the world's most famous beauty experts and gynecologists, Dr. Wei Niji of France and Dr. Eli Faks of the American Baxter Hospital, and Director Lu Xing, the success of female beauty must have high and prominent breast beauty, and plump and graceful buttocks beauty, in addition to the posture when walking. However, the above conditions must be based on health, especially if the female body's youth glands are not healthy, then the breasts will be atrophied, menstruation will be disordered, muscles will be thin, curves will be lost, and even after marriage, it will be difficult to bear children. Even if pregnancy occurs, healthy children will not be produced. Therefore, those who seek beauty, if they encounter such misfortunes, should quickly take the ovarian endocrine preparation for women, "Reproductin," to make the youth glands and ovarian function develop and flourish, so that metabolism is vigorous, menstruation is naturally accurate, breasts are high and prominent, buttocks are plump, curves are clear, and at the same time, the face must be delicate and charming, the muscles are smooth, the subcutaneous fat is full, and everything is full of the active posture of "beauty," worthy of being an advanced woman of the times.</p>
<p>Example: A female employee of a famous department store in this city, due to physical weakness and insufficient secretion of the reproductive glands (i.e., youth glands) and ovaries, had atrophied breasts, thin buttocks, and a haggard face. Later, through the introduction of a relative in the Western medicine department, she took "Reproductin" for women for less than two months, and her appearance was completely different. Not only did her breasts suddenly become high and prominent, firm and elastic, but also her long-standing menstrual irregularities were completely cured. Her complexion became rosy, and her skin was crystal clear. Those who saw her were amazed and praised her beauty.</p>
<h3>Untreated Nocturnal Emission is Like a Fire</h3>
<p>— Specialist in Venereal Diseases, Physician Zhan Nianceng</p>
<p>A single spark can start a prairie fire, and everyone knows that this is dangerous. Unfortunately, if a young person, due to ignorance and curiosity, commits masturbation or indulgence, or due to worry and labor, damages the sexual nerves and loosens the seminal vesicle, then a terrible nocturnal emission will surely erupt. Although in the beginning, the frequency of nocturnal emission is still low, and there is no pain or itching, it seems insignificant, but over time, if drips are not stopped, they will form rivers and seas. How many young people have turned mild nocturnal emissions into dangerous spermatorrhea due to lack of treatment; and how many men have suffered great physical losses due to untreated nocturnal emission, suffering from brain weakness and forgetfulness, insomnia and palpitations, back pain, kidney failure and premature ejaculation, incomplete development, and infertility. Such men will inevitably be sluggish in energy, unsightly in appearance, unable to advance in studies, and unable to succeed in their careers, despised by women, hated by wives and concubines, and fall into the miserable situation of losing education, losing jobs, losing love, and losing happiness; or even because their bodies have no stored essence, just like machines lacking oil, they will prematurely age and die young.</p>
<p>Treating nocturnal emission is like fighting a fire! Firefighting should be swift and thorough, and so should the treatment of nocturnal emission! According to the years of experience of famous doctors at home and abroad and ourselves, taking the effective remedy for nocturnal emission, "Hemitol's Semen-Consolidating Tablets," is the fastest and most thorough method, because this remedy can indeed consolidate the seminal vesicle and calm the nerves. After taking it, it can achieve the miraculous effect of sleep and stopping nocturnal emission on the same night. After taking it continuously for two weeks, it is guaranteed to be completely eradicated. However, those whose bodies have been depleted and have one or more of the aforementioned symptoms must also take the "Reproductin," a preparation made from the hormones of healthy animal reproductive glands, which will generate semen and tonify the kidneys, strengthen the brain and replenish blood, assist development, and nourish semen and blood within 24 hours after taking it. Taking it continuously for one month guarantees that all diseases will suddenly disappear and energy will be doubled. Regular consumption by middle-aged and elderly people will prolong life and rejuvenate oneself. If patients can come to the clinic in person for new therapies such as electrotherapy and injections, the effect will be even faster!</p>

<h3>The Chinese Army Achieves Successive Victories on Two Routes; Landmines Explode Under Shanghai-Hangzhou Passenger Trains; More Than Ten Passenger Trains Destroyed with Heavy Casualties; Japanese Automobiles in Suzhou Attacked by the Chinese Army</h3>
<p>According to people from Tianhang, the Chinese army in the suburbs has been exceptionally active recently, so gunshots have been heard frequently in the vicinity, and residents are panicked. Recently, a large number of security soldiers stationed in Hangzhou secretly crossed the Qiantang River to surrender. The Chinese army authorities not only reassured them but also rewarded them. Recently, the Japanese have been fleeing in droves, so it is rumored that troops have been dispatched to guard the area. It is also reported that the Japanese stationed on the north bank of the Qiantang River are not only buying from the south bank but also proclaiming that they will attack Shaoxing and other places in the near future. The Chinese army authorities, in addition to preparing to defend themselves, are also preparing for a bold attack on the provincial capital.</p>
<p>Beijing-Shanghai Areas</p>
<p>Japanese Suffer Heavy Losses</p>
<p>Also according to people from Suzhou, in the past half month, the Chinese army in the Beijing-Shanghai area has been active again. All Japanese troops in the area are panicking, especially in Suzhou and Changzhou. It is rumored that yesterday (the 10th) morning, a Japanese military vehicle traveling from Beijing to Suzhou was attacked by the Chinese army in the area near Suzhou. It is also learned that the Chinese army near Jintan attacked the Japanese military headquarters the night before (the 8th), inflicting heavy losses on the Japanese. The New Fourth Army in the suburbs of Nanjing has also been quite active recently. In addition to repeatedly attacking the Japanese army, they have also warned residents to quickly move out to minimize casualties during the general counterattack.</p>
<p>Shanghai-Hangzhou Passenger Trains</p>
<p>Landmines Detonate in Wangdian</p>
<p>The 108th Division of the Chinese Army in the Shanghai-Hangzhou area was ordered to move out a few days ago and laid landmines near Jiaxing and Wangdian. The next day, a passenger train from Hangzhou to Shanghai detonated the landmines. About 60 Japanese soldiers were killed or injured in the train, and many passengers were also killed or injured. It is reported that the injured were immediately sent to the "Jiaxing Hospital," and the dead were buried on the spot. It is reported that after the incident, the Japanese army in Wangdian not only searched the area extensively but also forced nearby shop residents to repair the road for about two hours before it was over. All uninjured passengers were transported to Shanghai on vehicles sent from Hangzhou.</p>
<p>No Banditry in Ganyaol Area</p>
<p>The Ganyaol People's National Salvation Army is quite ambitious. Since Mr. Gu personally reorganized it, its strength has become even greater. It is reported that in addition to repeatedly defeating the Japanese army, Mr. Gu's troops are concerned that bandits may take the opportunity to run rampant as winter approaches, so he has ordered his subordinates to strictly apprehend them. Anyone captured will be punished severely by Mr. Gu without exception. Therefore, there is no banditry in Ganyaol, Youchegang, Nanhui, Darenzhuang, and other places under the jurisdiction of Mr. Gu.</p>
<h3>The Yue-Gui New Road</h3>
<p>With the loss of Ningming County in Guangxi Province, the Yue-Gui transportation was suddenly interrupted, and various cargo transportation companies felt quite inconvenienced. The only thing that could be relied upon to communicate was the Zhenyue Railway. However, goods stored in Haiphong could not be cleared out for a while, and new goods could not be transported. Passenger transportation was also quite crowded. The Chinese and Vietnamese authorities, concerned about this, planned to open a new road to communicate. Recently, a new road connecting Vietnam and Guangxi Province has been completed. Its starting point is Gaoping in Vietnam, passing through Jingxi, Dabao, Tiandong, Tianyang, Donglan, and Chehe in Guangxi Province, and reaching Liuzhai, connecting with the Yue-Gui Highway. From there, it is convenient to go to Guiyang, Chongqing, and other places.</p>
<h3>Background of the Phillips Case: A Rumor Circulates That the Goal Was to Halt Negotiations on Cross-Boundary Road Construction, Allegedly to Show That the "Mayor" of Chuan Xiao'an Had Suffered a Political Failure</h3>
<p>The English-language "Ta Mei Evening Post" reported that, according to news from the "Badlands," the underlying cause of the assassination attempt on Phillips, the chief executive and director-general of the Shanghai Municipal Council, on Saturday morning on Haig Road, was a power struggle for the position of mayor of Shanghai. It was alleged that certain people within a faction were eager to obtain the position of "mayor" of Shanghai and therefore planned to assassinate Phillips in order to halt the negotiations led by Chuan Xiao'an, the "mayor" appointed by the Japanese side, regarding the issue of cross-boundary road construction. According to this faction, if Chuan succeeded in the negotiations, it would greatly reduce their chances of ascending to the position. It was reported that those who planned this conspiracy also intended to have the assailants flee into the "Badlands" after committing the crime, and then spread rumors that the case was the work of people sent by Chongqing. However, the three assailants were unexpectedly captured by the bodyguards of the New New Casino, and their meticulously planned conspiracy failed.</p>
<h3>Flat-Price Rice Relief Measures Prepared; Authorities to Assist in Protection; More Than 28,000 Bags of Gongshan Rice Imported This Morning; Free Rice Porridge Distribution Changed to New Dagulu</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Flat-Price Rice Relief Committee sent a letter to the chief executive of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession and the director-general of the Shanghai French Concession, stating, "Respected Sirs, recently, rice prices in this city have skyrocketed, making life difficult for the people, and the poor who live day to day have found themselves in dire straits. If relief is not provided, the future is unimaginable. We have been concerned about providing assistance and have invited representatives from various commercial societies and national organizations, as well as enthusiastic individuals from all walks of life, to organize the Shanghai Flat-Price Rice Relief Committee to raise funds for flat-price rice relief and handle flat-price rice relief matters. It has been agreed that starting from the 18th of this month, within the two concessions, one hundred rice shops will be entrusted to issue tickets at fifty shops and distribute rice at fifty shops to begin operations, with the intention of distributing to sixty shops in the Public Concession and forty shops in the French Concession to achieve widespread coverage. We respectfully send this letter and request that Your Excellency the Chief Executive provide assistance and protect your subordinates, and extend our friendly greetings."</p>
<p>Foreign Rice Arrives in Shanghai</p>
<p>The continuous arrival of foreign rice in Shanghai has been reported in previous newspapers. It is now learned that another large batch of approximately 28,200 bags of Gongyou rice, loaded from Saigon on the French mail ship "Adomos First," is scheduled to be imported this morning. The ship is scheduled to dock at the Gonghexiang Wharf in Hongkou. The foreign rice will also be temporarily stored in the Gonghexiang warehouse.</p>
<p>Consultations on Flat-Price Relief</p>
<p>After the Rice Shop Trade Association resolved to accept the Flat-Price Rice Relief Committee's delegation to handle flat-price relief, it has designated one hundred member rice shops in the two concessions to handle the matter. It has now dispatched personnel to solicit the consent of each member and will soon convene a meeting to handle the procedures, with the intention of implementing it from January 18th. The first round of flat-price rice relief involves 16,000 bags of broken rice purchased by the Flat-Price Rice Relief Committee in Shanghai, and it is stipulated that each shop will distribute 50 bags of flat-price rice per day, with the intention of distributing them within one week. After 15,000 bags ordered from Saigon arrive, the distribution will continue.</p>
<p>Free Rice Porridge and Mantou</p>
<p>The Shanghai Charity Federation, in view of the current high prices of everything in the city and the difficulty for the poor to make a living, especially those who are freezing and starving, which are more numerous than in previous years, advanced its schedule to distribute free rice porridge and mantou (steamed buns) in the New Dagulu area starting at 7:00 PM the night before (the 9th). Yesterday, the poor who heard the news flocked to receive the free aid and were quite crowded, totaling more than eight hundred. Eight bags of flour were distributed, making more than two thousand mantou, each weighing four taels, and three large wooden barrels of hot rice porridge. In view of the large number of poor people waiting for aid, the flour was specially increased to fourteen bags last night, making a total of more than five thousand mantou. The poor waiting for aid were mostly workers and rickshaw pullers. After receiving the mantou and rice porridge, they all smiled happily. The original location for the distribution the night before was in the Longmenlu area, but due to the inconvenience caused by the Lei trolley, it was changed to the middle section of New Dagulu for distribution. The federation dispatched Mr. Lu Deshen, Mr. Cheng Tongsheng, and Mr. Wang Limin to take care of the scene. Chief Zhang Wenjun of the Chengdu Road Police Station, leading Chinese and Western detectives, was responsible for maintaining order, and the process went quite well.</p>
<p>Aid Distribution Method</p>
<p>The aid distribution work continued last night and will end at the end of the old lunar year. As for the amount distributed, it is currently stipulated that each person can receive two mantou and a bowl of hot rice porridge. However, last night, because many people brought cups and pots, the order was slightly chaotic. The federation has now posted a notice stating that each resident waiting for aid must bring a cup or bowl to collect the hot rice porridge to maintain order.</p>
<p>The Situation of Distributing Free Mantou on New Dagulu</p>

<h3>Rumor that the Pseudo-Army in the Nanshi Area Was Suddenly Disarmed</h3>
<p>A few days ago, pseudo-army suddenly stationed at the Guandi Temple on Zhaojiabang Road in the old Ximen area of Nanshi, strictly resembling a military institution. Unexpectedly, from 5:00 AM on the 9th to 6:00 AM on the 10th, Jun Ning soldiers stationed in Nanshi and Chongdao Zhengichi, the Nanshi squad leader of the Shanghai Special Affairs Agency, Saito, the Japanese instructor of the Nanshi Police Sub-bureau, and others supervised more than 30 fully armed Japanese soldiers of the Nanshi Garrison Force, drove many cars and military trucks, established a cordon and surrounded the area, and copied and detained more than 200 people in all uniforms and documents, and more than 500 rifles, loaded them onto trucks, and drove them to the original site of the former Municipal Police Bureau on Penglai Road to temporarily detain the Japanese Nanshi Ningbing branch. At the same time, there were also so-called branch troops of a certain army's presidential branch in Jingjiang Guild Hall outside the old Ximen Gate, and a certain surname garden house next to the Chen Yingchishi Memorial Tower, Jiangxi Guild Hall on Dongjiadu Xiaoputuo Bridge, Catholic Church, and Merchant Guild Hall on Guild Hall Street, but there were only a few people listening and guarding the door, and they were also detained. As for the inside story of the case, it is not known to outsiders.</p>

<h3>The Battle of Nicheng in Nanhui Captain Huang Martyred</h3>
<p>In the battle of Nicheng in Nanhui, the Japanese and puppets asked Nakamura for help from Datuan, and Nakamura immediately sent a team of about 300 soldiers to reinforce them, and a fierce battle broke out with the Chinese side's Gu troops. Huang Jianzhong, the second captain, led his soldiers bravely to meet the enemy, but due to the disparity in numbers, Chen Shang was shot twice. One bullet entered from the right waist and exited from the left waist, and the other bullet entered from the right shoulder and exited from behind the shoulder. Soldiers helped him away and hired a boat overnight to try to transport him to Shanghai for treatment, but he died halfway. Captain Huang was about thirty years old, honest and brave in combat, and had a good relationship with the people. He was formerly the captain of the first company of the special service brigade, and was promoted to the first captain of the first brigade of the independent second team last month, and was still attached to Gu Jimin's troops, and the local people were extremely distressed.</p>

<h3>U.S. Consul General Gauss to Take Up Post After Meeting with Johnson; Will First Return to the U.S. with Family Before Going to Australia; Appointment Awaits Approval from the U.S. State Department</h3>
<p>U.S. Consul General in Shanghai, Gauss, received an order from President Roosevelt on the evening of the 8th to serve as the first U.S. Minister to Australia. Mr. Gauss is a veteran in diplomatic circles, having entered the diplomatic service in 1906. He first came to China in 1907 as the U.S. Vice Consul in Shanghai and was promoted to Consul General in Shanghai on December 9, 1935. Mr. Gauss has twice</p>
<p>gone to Washington to report on his duties. He has spent most of his years in China. Mr. Gauss is scheduled to meet with Ambassador Johnson in mid-month and then take his family via Kobe, Honolulu, and San Francisco back to the United States before taking up his new post in Australia. According to Mr. Gauss, after being appointed as the first minister to Australia, he was very pleased. He believes that Australia is an independent</p>
<p>republic within the British Empire. Its friendship and diplomatic contact with the nations of the Pacific and the United States are of great importance, as contact between the two sides will strengthen practical work. After taking office, he will do his best to foster sincere affection and love between the two countries. Having lived in Shanghai for a long time,</p>
<p>parting is naturally filled with reluctance and melancholy. He feels deeply saddened to be separated from the Allied forces in Shanghai, but driven by orders, he has no choice but to temporarily bid farewell. President Roosevelt's dispatch of Gauss to assume this important post undoubtedly relies on Gauss's extensive experience in diplomatic affairs. However, the order is still subject to</p>
<p>the approval of the U.S. State Department, so Mr. Gauss has not yet received official notification. He also does not know who the successor will be, but it is generally believed to be Mr. Locke Heed, who served as Acting Consul General when Mr. Gauss left Shanghai for Manila last year. Mr. Gauss has no so-called opinions to express before taking office. Regarding the transfer of consulate staff, it is said that there will be no changes due to his departure from Shanghai. Before taking office, he will mostly need to first</p>
<p>return to the United States and then proceed to take over the new post. Before coming to Shanghai, Mr. Gauss worked in Washington for several years, then transferred to the Consulate General in Paris. After coming to China, he served in the U.S. Embassy in Beijing for diplomatic affairs and concurrently as Consul in Beijing. Later he was</p>
<p>transferred to Shanghai to serve as the U.S. Consul General in Shanghai. Last year, on November 21, Mr. Gauss accompanied General Heard to Manila for a special meeting to discuss the general interests of the United States in the Far East. He also discussed the upcoming abolition of the U.S.-Japan Commercial Treaty on the 26th of this month, which aroused widespread attention. On the evening of the 2nd of this month, he returned to Shanghai from leave on the President Pierce ship with his wife and eldest son, Charles.</p>
<h3>Strict Prohibition on Silver Shops from Buying or Selling Gold; No Further Production of Gold Ornaments Allowed; Violators Will Be Punished</h3>
<p>An order from the Executive Yuan to the municipal governments of each province stated: According to Electricity No. 1513 of the Ministry of Finance in Chongqing, it is stated that the centralized storage of gold is an important policy during extraordinary times. The Ministry has repeatedly issued measures for exchanging gold for legal tender,</p>
<p>measures for encouraging exchange,</p>
<p>measures for supervising silver shops, and has urged the four banks, namely, Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Communications Bank, and Farmers Bank of China, to earnestly collect gold and silver. All provincial governments and their affiliated agencies should thoroughly assist in the process. Since the announcement of the measures for supervising silver shops, the purchase of gold by silver shops, to be used as raw materials, has been limited to gold in the form of ornaments; they are not allowed to purchase gold bars, gold leaves, gold nuggets, or any raw gold. The original intention was to conserve extravagance and eliminate the waste of precious gold.</p>
<p>Since implementation, there has been no shortage of silver shops abiding by government orders. However, there are still many who outwardly comply but inwardly defy, purchasing gold to make ornaments. Some local silver shop owners even secretly raise prices to compete for purchases, entrusting silver shops to crudely make ornaments to facilitate smuggling and hoarding for personal gain. It has been repeatedly reported that in provinces such as Sichuan and Hunan, which are known for gold production, newly produced gold is mostly</p>
<p>purchased at inflated prices, making it difficult for legal and authorized agencies to collect gold according to the official listed prices. If fundamental measures are not taken, it will be difficult to uphold government orders and</p>
<p>national strength. Eleven articles on measures to ban the purchase and sale of gold have now been formulated, announced, and implemented. From the date of implementation, silver shops, or any organization or individual, are strictly prohibited from buying gold bars, gold leaves, gold nuggets, any raw gold, gold utensils, or gold ornaments. Silver shops are also</p>
<p>not allowed to produce</p>
<p>gold ornaments for sale. Existing gold finished products, semi-finished products, and gold materials will be checked and counted by the four banks' collection offices and branches, together with local administrative officials, in accordance with these measures. The collection agencies will collect the items in accordance with the preferential reward measures. Any violations will be punished in accordance with the provisions of these measures. In addition to the Ministry's announcement and telegraphic report to the Military Affairs Commission,</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang</p>
<p>for review, a letter was sent to the joint office of the four banks, the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, the Communications Bank, and the Farmers Bank of China, and forwarded to the gold and silver collection office for compliance, and a separate message was sent to the provincial governments for compliance and assistance. The original measures are listed and sent to the Judicial Yuan to forward to all subordinate courts for compliance. This order (measures omitted)</p>
<h3>Two Chinese Police Officers Arrested, Then Released</h3>
<p>The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reported that yesterday (the 9th) at 7:30 p.m., two Chinese police officers of the Public Concession, on duty at Wujiaochang on Baiduhui Road and Nanhui Road, entered a teahouse outside the Concession boundary and were arrested by Japanese military police. Their service pistols and ammunition were confiscated. The Japanese military police immediately notified the Jing'an Temple police station. Within half an hour, a senior police officer from the Police Department retrieved the two Chinese police officers and their pistols. At approximately 7:40 p.m. yesterday, on Kangding Road and Jiesfei Road, in the alley next to Yifengli, three Chinese police officers were urinating when two Japanese military police officers approached and disarmed the Chinese police officers of their three pistols. The three Chinese police officers immediately protested, and the Japanese military police, unable to prevail, quickly returned to the police station to report the incident.</p>
<h3>Commander Minjun of Northern Jiangsu, Ma Yuren, Dies for His Country; Killed in Action at Sanhejian on the 2nd of This Month</h3>
<p>Ma Yuren, Commander of the Northern Jiangsu Republic's Anti-Japanese Forces, died heroically at noon on the 3rd of this month in the Sanhejian area of Xinwu Township, District 9, Funing, leading his troops in hand-to-hand combat with the Japanese army. The Jiangsu Provincial Government immediately reported to the central authorities, requesting that he be given a posthumous commendation and that Commander Ma's heroic deeds in resisting Japan be praised. Commander Ma Yuren, whose courtesy name was Bolang, was 63 years old. He was originally from Yancheng, Jiangsu. During the era of the Northern Warlords, he served as the Garrison Commander of Huaiyang for many years and also served as the commander of the 32nd Army of the Northern Expeditionary Army. Later, as he aged and his strength waned, he retired to Shanghai. Until the "August 13th" Shanghai Battle, President Chiang, recognizing Ma's familiarity with the geography of northern Jiangsu, appointed him to the important position of Commander of the Northern Jiangsu People's Anti-Japanese Forces. He then equipped various locations, summoned his old troops, and launched surprise attacks on the Japanese army, repeatedly achieving military successes. After Ma's death, his fellow villagers sent telegrams to express their condolences to his family. It is said that Ma only left behind one grandson and his posthumous affairs are very bleak.</p>
<h3>Revival Bonds Drawn Yesterday; 1.7 Million Yuan in Principal to Be Repaid; Payments to Begin at the End of February</h3>
<p>The eighth repayment of principal for the 25th Year of the Republic Revival Bonds was held yesterday morning at 10:00 a.m. at the Bank Club. Fan Jietang of the National Debt Fund Management Committee, Pei Yunqing of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, Wu Yunzhai of the Bankers' Association, Shen Jingxue of the Money Trade Association, Wang Lin of the Central Bank of China, Fan Chuchen of the Communications Bank, and Tang Yuesun of the Bank of China attended. Chairman Pei Yunqing reported,</p>
<p>"Today is the eighth repayment of principal for the 25th Year of the Republic Revival Bonds. The drawing method uses the last three digits. I will briefly report to everyone on the circumstances of these bonds. The Revival Bonds were issued in February of the 25th Year of the Republic with a fixed amount of 34 million national currency. This is the eighth repayment of principal, with five draws, each worth 340,000 yuan, for a total principal repayment of 1.7 million yuan. The principal and interest due on the drawn bonds will be paid starting on February 29, 29th Year of the Republic, in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry of Finance. Payments will be made by the Central Bank of China and its entrusted banks, the Bank of China, the Communications Bank, and the Central Trust Bureau. Now, please inspect the counterfoil books so that the lottery can be carried out." After the inspectors verified that the counterfoils were correct, the representatives of the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, and the Communications Bank carried out the lottery. The drawn numbers are listed below: [170], [483], [591], [696], [837]. As for the numbers, types, number of sheets, and total amount of all the drawn bonds, they will be publicly announced and widely known.</p>
<h3>High Pressure System Advances; Weather Turns Cold</h3>
<p>Yesterday's weather in the city was affected by the advance of a high-pressure system to the Yangtze River basin, resulting in a sudden cold snap. A strong northeast wind blew all day, but the sky had already cleared, turning from cloudy to sunny, with sunshine. There was no sign of rain.</p>
<p>As the high pressure system approaching the Yangtze River basin will not cause major changes, the mornings and evenings already feel heavy with dew and frost. The scantily clad poor and beggars cannot withstand the cold.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of winter, there has been no snowfall in various parts of China. According to the observatory, Dalian experienced its first snowfall yesterday. The temperature in Dalian yesterday was 0 degrees Celsius, slightly lower than the previous day.</p>
<p>A low-pressure system seems to be forming in the Tianjin area, so the temperature there is also higher than the previous day. If a low-pressure system does develop there, the weather in the city may also be affected, resulting in rain or snow. However, it is still difficult to predict whether it will form. There has been no rainfall in the city since the rainfall on November 26 last year.</p>
<p>After the weather turned cold, the death rate of beggars sleeping on the streets and refugees in various shelters increased sharply. According to a reporter from the Datong News Agency's inquiry at the Pushan Villa, the hall had collected 12 corpses of people who had frozen to death on the road the day before, which had increased to 22 yesterday.</p>
<p>The temperature in the city decreased further yesterday, dropping below freezing in the morning between 5:00 and 6:00 a.m. Observing the weather, it may become even colder during the day. Also, since the 8th, the high tide in the Huangpu River has erupted suddenly, and it will take until the 11th to subside. As a result, there has been accumulated water on the roads in the shady areas at zero hour in the afternoon for several days.</p>
<h3>British Straits Settlements Government Limits Import of Goods Not from Sterling Countries; Shanghai National Product Manufacturers Are Very Anxious</h3>
<p>In addition to doing everything possible to sell domestically, most of the national products produced by various national product factories in the city are shipped to various territories in the Nanyang region, namely, the Malay Peninsula, the Philippine Islands, the Dutch East Indies, Vietnam, Thailand, and Burma. Approximately 8 million overseas Chinese reside in these regions and enthusiastically adopt national products from their motherland. Therefore, the value of national products sold to the south each month is quite substantial. Now, the British Straits Settlements government has issued a ban, and Shanghai is one of the places listed as prohibited. Upon hearing this, the various national product factories in the city are extremely anxious and have jointly sent a letter to the national product inspection representatives stationed overseas. The original letter is recorded below: [Dear Sirs, We have heard that the British Straits Settlements government, in order to control foreign trade and strengthen the domestic economic base, issued a ban and restriction on the import of goods from non-sterling countries on November 17 of last year. Goods from sterling countries are not subject to the ban. A large number of national products from Shanghai are shipped to the region each month. If this is implemented, it will inevitably suffer a severe blow. Therefore, the various national product factories in Shanghai are extremely anxious. We have learned that 76 types of goods are subject to restrictions on import into the Straits Settlements, and 236 types are prohibited from import. We dare to ask you to investigate and reply on our behalf.]</p>
<h3>Sketches of Charity Food and Ginger Tea Distribution</h3>
<p>— Yangtze River</p>
<p>(Special Feature by this Newspaper) The cold wave has struck, and the temperature has plummeted to below zero again. The numerous collection vehicles of the charity halls are shuttling back and forth, which clearly reflects how the dark side of the extremely "prosperous" "isolated island" is expanding and deepening.</p>
<p>According to the statistics of the Public Works Department, there were 32 refugee shelters in the Public Concession a month ago, housing 37,319 refugees. From these numbers, we can imagine the difficulties these many homeless and wandering compatriots are facing, and the urgent need for assistance they have!</p>
<p>Recently, the Shanghai Charity Organizations Federation, in view of the rising prices and the hardship of the lives of ordinary poor people and refugees who have come to Shanghai to take refuge, has specially allocated funds to set up shelters at 330 North Fujian Road and the Catholic Church in Xujiahui. The first shelter has already accommodated more than 800 poor people, solving their difficulties in getting through the cold winter. At the same time, in order to relieve the poor who are suffering from hunger and cold, they have been distributing steamed buns and hot ginger tea on the streets since the night before last (the first day of the twelfth lunar month).</p>
<p>In previous years, the places where various charity groups distributed relief were originally in the area south of the racecourse and Huangmen Road. This year, because the 20-road trolley bus has started operating, in order to maintain good order, it has been necessary to move to a more convenient location.</p>
<p>Around 7:00 p.m. the night before last, a transport vehicle from the Charity Organizations Federation carried more than 3,500 steamed buns and two large wooden barrels of hot ginger tea to the middle section of Xin Datian Road for distribution. More than 1,000 poor people waiting for relief had already gathered there. They were all dressed in very thin and ragged clothes. Most of them were laborers, rickshaw pullers, refugees, and street beggars. Old and young, carrying hope, they rushed here, crowding the not very wide Xin Datian Road.</p>
<p>With the efforts of several staff members of the Charity Organizations Federation and patrol police officers to maintain order, all the gathered poor people were cordoned off with ropes on the sidewalks and came out in single file. Each person was given two steamed buns made of flour (each weighing four ounces, with a total of eight bags of flour used on the first day, each bag weighing 36 catties), and a bowl of hot ginger tea (made by boiling local ginger and brown sugar, the taste is sweet and spicy, and eating it can increase body temperature and resist the invasion of cold air).</p>
<p>This relief work is very beneficial to the poor. It started on the 9th and will end on February 7 (that is, the end of the lunar year). This news should be celebrated by the poor on the frozen and hungry road! However, it is said that the Charity Organizations Federation is extremely short of funds for relief, especially today when the dark side of the "isolated island" is expanding and deepening, and their relief work has more of a feeling that there are more monks than there is gruel. We hope that all sectors will generously donate!</p>
<h3>Resolution to Eliminate Commissions for Prescriptions; New Pharmaceutical Industry Immediately Notifies Member Pharmacies to Implement</h3>
<p>The Shanghai New Pharmaceutical Industry Association, acting on the advice of ten doctors, including Zhun Diaoxinde, Wang Wanbai, and Shi Siming, suggested that pharmacies often give commissions to doctors for prescriptions as a means of liaison. This expense is indirectly taken from the patients, and from a moral standpoint, it is not appropriate. They requested that a resolution be established and that member pharmacies be notified to eliminate this long-standing practice. The association specially convened a meeting of the Standing Committee at its meeting place on Longmen Road at 3:00 p.m. yesterday, and decided to accept the proposal. It immediately notified the member pharmacies to follow the instructions.</p>
<h3>Gonorrhea Lecture: Prostatitis Has Been Resolved</h3>
<p>— Written by Dr. Yao Juyan</p>
<p>Clinic: 9 Ningbo Road, intersection of 430 Road. Clinic hours: 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.</p>
<p>If gonorrhea is not treated promptly, it often becomes chronic gonorrhea, and in most cases, it easily turns into prostatitis. Once it becomes prostatitis, the symptoms fluctuate and are difficult to eliminate. The symptoms are initially difficulty in urination, frequent urination, and swelling in the anus and perineum. Later, these symptoms gradually disappear, and the urine changes from turbid to clear and transparent. On the surface, it is almost the same as before the illness. However, it is not known that these gonococci are deeply lurking and waiting for an opportunity to act. Whenever one encounters drinking, labor, or sexual intercourse, the disease suddenly recurs. If this continues to recur, the body will weaken day by day, and there is a risk of prostatitis leading to infertility. It is necessary to seek treatment quickly. Recently, there has been a fundamental solution for this difficult-to-treat prostatitis. That is, to use the gonorrhea holy medicine [Kelinong] as an internal medicine to resist bacteriophages, so that the gonococci in the prostate gland have no room to survive and are eliminated. For those with enlarged glands, alternating use of German electrotherapy and X-ray electrotherapy can be used to eliminate gonorrhea toxins, correct the disease, and restore original health. I have been in clinical practice for nearly 20 years, and I have used almost all kinds of gonorrhea treatments. However, their advantages and disadvantages are half and half, or the good does not cover the bad. None of them are as safe and thorough as the treatment I described above. Moreover, there are no residual undesirable symptoms after curing gonorrhea, which is especially commendable. Clinic hours: 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Starting today, 20 consultation tickets will be sent out every day. Each ticket costs only 5 dimes and comes with a copy of the book "Complete Book on Sexually Transmitted Diseases." Also treats syphilis, gonorrhea, and sexual neurasthenia.</p>

<h3>Postal Headquarters Bloodshed; Western Police Officer Shot; Head of Cleaning Workers Enraged; Police Officer Wounded in Chest While Investigating; Seriously Wounded, Perpetrator Arrested on the Spot</h3>
<p>The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reported that Crane Kerr, a 21-year-old Western police officer of the Public Concession Police Department, was shot while mediating a dispute at the postal headquarters on North Suzhou Road at noon today (the 10th). He sustained a chest wound and is seriously injured. He is now being treated at the Country Hospital. The perpetrator is a Mr. A, the manager of a cleaning company, who has been arrested by detectives from the Wayside police station. It is reported that workers from the cleaning company had a dispute with an employee of the postal headquarters at the tiger stove yesterday (the 9th). Mr. A, the manager of the cleaning company, took a pistol and went to the postal headquarters with several people at noon today to reason with the employee who had the dispute yesterday. Another heated argument ensued. Patrol officers on North Suzhou Road who were searching pedestrians heard the report and went to the post office to inquire. As Crane Kerr entered the post office, a bullet suddenly struck his upper chest. Whether the shooter intended to fire or it was accidental due to anger cannot yet be determined. However, there were two shots fired at the time. Mr. A, who fired the shots, was arrested by police officers from the Wayside police station.</p>
<p>(Special report from this newspaper) After 12:00 noon yesterday, a shooting occurred in the courtyard of the North Sichuan Road Postal Administration, injuring Western police officer Crane Kerr. After this incident occurred, the Hongkou Wayside police station arrested and detained the perpetrator, Bao Depei, as well as Weng Yongyuan, a coolie from the parcel delivery team of the post office, and a Mr. Meng, a coolie from the empty bag room. According to news obtained by this newspaper, the details are as follows:</p>
<p>Cause of the Incident</p>
<p>The Postal Administration has a tiger stove on the ground floor, which is exclusively for the use of the bureau's staff. Recently, due to soaring coal prices, the restrictions on water collection by letter carriers in the bureau have been tightened. It is stipulated that only those wearing uniforms can collect water. The cleaning of the bureau is contracted to the Far East Cleaning Company, which dispatches more than 20 workers to work in the bureau on a regular basis, and dispatches Bao Depei to supervise the workers. Recently, the workers have been refused water collection, and often argue with the bureau workers, and neither side will give in. This has been the cause of the incident for more than a day.</p>
<p>Mutual Disputes</p>
<p>Therefore, at noon yesterday, Bao requested that the bureau go to the tiger stove to negotiate. Unexpectedly, the words caused mutual disputes. Bao was surrounded by more than 20 people from the parcel delivery team of the bureau, including Weng Yongyuan from Jiangbei and Meng from the empty bag room. Bao was anxious and took out his pistol to demonstrate. When the besieged saw the gun, they began to flee. Unexpectedly, when they approached the courtyard, they were surrounded by two other people. Bao's bullets were ejected from the chamber. According to eyewitnesses, it penetrated the sole of the shoe of a worker from the Far East Cleaning Company, but the foot was not injured.</p>
<p>Western Police Officer Shot</p>
<p>While the conflict between the two sides was intensifying, Crane Kerr, a Western police officer trainee on patrol on North Sichuan Road, heard about it. Kerr immediately entered the post office to investigate the situation, and attempted to take Bao Depei's pistol. Unexpectedly, a disaster followed. The bullet struck the upper chest of the Western police officer. It is said that the gun was discharged due to accidental discharge. After being injured, Kerr used the phone on the third floor to notify the Wayside police station in charge, which immediately dispatched a large number of detectives to suppress the incident, and arrested Bao Depei, a member of the cleaning company who committed the crime, and Weng Yongyuan and Meng, coolies from the post office, and sent them to the Wayside police station for interrogation. An ambulance was called to transport Western police officer Crane Kerr to the Country Hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>Kerr's Brief History</p>
<p>According to reports, Kerr is 20 years old and a graduate of Shanghai West College. He is the brother-in-law of Western police officer patrol Da Huier. Another sister has already passed away. Her husband, Clolai, once worked at the Jianghai Customs and was killed in Hankou in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River last year. His old mother lives in Shanghai, and his father died early. Kerr is currently a Western police officer trainee at the Wayside police station. After being injured, he was sent to the Country Hospital for treatment. It is said that the bullet did not penetrate and the injury is quite serious.</p>
<h3>Thugs Intend to Rob; Frightened and Flee</h3>
<p>The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reported that Dr. Mark Kang, a physician at the American International Assurance Company, lives at 244 Hongkou Road. At 9:15 p.m. last night (the 9th), Dr. Mark suddenly heard a loud noise downstairs on the second floor of his residence. He leaned out the window and seemed to hear the sound of a pistol being cocked. He went downstairs and asked in Chinese, "Who is it?" He faintly heard someone answer, "Telephone." Dr. Mark returned upstairs and rang for the servant. As the servant was about to go upstairs, he was struck hard on the back of the head and fell to the ground with a loud noise. The thugs seemed to have been frightened and fled in groups. Afterwards, Dr. Mark found out that the loud noise he had heard earlier was caused by the shattering of glass on the doors of the dining room and study. The stool in front of the piano was also slightly damaged. The chauffeur then called the Public Concession Police Department, and the Jing'an Temple police station dispatched a team of detectives, who cooperated with the Japanese military police to investigate the scene.</p>
<h3>Japanese Transportation Company: Chauffeur Embezzles Raw Silk, Sells It for 19,000 Yuan, Chauffeur at Large, Accomplices Sentenced to Detention</h3>
<p>The Japanese Tongyun Transfer Company, located at 213 Shandong Road, instructed chauffeur Feng Zixiang on the 19th of last month to transport raw silk worth 41,600 yuan to the Dehua Transfer Company in the Securities Building on Jiujiang Road. Unexpectedly, Feng embezzled the silk and</p>
<p>Fled Without a Trace</p>
<p>After Tongyun Company reported the incident to the General Inspectorate, Japanese Detective Kobayashi, Chinese Detective Jiang Shangpei, Detective Inspector Yan Heng, and Ren Fengwu launched an investigation. They discovered that Feng had prior knowledge of the shipment before being instructed to transport it, indicating malicious intent. He consulted with his friend Cui Zhenmin regarding the sale of the embezzled goods. Cui introduced him to Xu Yusheng, who in turn introduced him to Shou Chunlin. Shou then connected him with someone named Yang Yiqing, who</p>
<p>Intended to Purchase</p>
<p>and instructed Feng to deliver the goods to the Zhonghua Transfer Company at 16, Lane 305, 16 Fujian Road, to be handed over to Zhang Huaiting from Shaoxing. Consequently, Feng delivered the silk to the Zhonghua Transfer Company as ordered, and Yang paid Feng 19,000 yuan in legal tender, completing the transaction. Yang then immediately pawned the goods to Ruihe Foreign Firm. The detectives subsequently</p>
<p>Arrested</p>
<p>Zhang Huaiting, Xu Yusheng, Cui Zhenmin, and Shou Chunlin one after another. Feng Zixiang and Yang Yiqing remain at large. Under interrogation, it was learned that Xu, Cui, and Shou each received 700 yuan in compensation from Feng. The detectives recovered 1,555 yuan of the compensation. Yesterday morning, the Shanxi Prefectural Court, represented by lawyer Ru Baozuo, prosecuted them under Article 349 of the Criminal Law for acting as intermediaries in the sale of stolen goods. They stated that when Yang paid Feng the selling price of 19,000 yuan, 800 yuan was missing, and Zhang Huaiting</p>
<p>Advanced 800</p>
<p>yuan to cover the shortage. This 800 yuan has not yet been recovered. After questioning by Qian Hongye, the presiding judge of the criminal court, Xu Yusheng, Cui Zhenmin, and Shou Chunlin were found guilty of acting as intermediaries for stolen goods and sentenced to 50 days of detention and fined 100 yuan each. Zhang Huaiting was found not guilty.</p>
<h3>Paternal Uncle Indecently Entices Woman into Adultery, Sentenced to Eight Months Imprisonment</h3>
<p>Zhou Jinhui, a Ningbo native residing at 699 Maigen Road, is a coppersmith foreman in the machinery department of a coal briquette company. His daughter, Yunmei (18 years old), was lured out by Zhou Zongpin, a fellow townsman, around 10 a.m. on June 2 of last year, under the false pretense of introducing her to work at the Hongda Silk Factory on Singapore Road. He tricked her into staying overnight at the Xinzha Inn on Xinzha Road. The next day, he took her to the home of Wang Wenyu, a Jiaxing native, at 33 Yongshun Lane, Jiaozhou Road, renting the upper floor and cohabiting with her until August of this year. When Zhou Zongpin ran out of money, he instructed Yunmei to secretly return home. Her father, Zhou Jinhui, learned the truth and reported it to the Gordon Road Police Station. Detectives were dispatched to arrest Zhou Zongpin, but were unsuccessful. The informant learned that Zhou Zongpin was hiding in the Xinpíng Coal Briquette Shop on Route Ferguson in the French Concession. They secretly went to the address and arrested him, taking him into custody at the police station. Yesterday, he was handed over to the Special Court. Police lawyer Qian Xun prosecuted him for enticing adultery and disrupting the family. He stated that the defendant claimed at the police station that he had a physical relationship with Yunmei around May of the 16th year of the Republic and that the woman was willing, requesting prosecution. Subsequently, Yunmei and her father, Zhou Jinhui, testified about the events. Zhou Jinhui stated that the defendant was a distant cousin and should not have committed such an indecent act. When questioned, the defendant claimed that he and Yunmei were cousins, that his mother was the plaintiff's sister, and that the relationship with Yunmei occurred before August 12. The plaintiff was aware of the situation, and he paid 20 yuan per month for household expenses. Recently, he was unable to pay, so he reported the matter to the police. He pleaded for leniency. Judge Xiao Peishen, finding Zhou Zongpin's behavior immoral and indecent for enticing a woman under twenty years old away from her family, sentenced him to eight months in prison as a warning.</p>
<h3>A Dancing Girl is Murdered in Jing'an Villa, Chen Aimei Found Dead in Her Room with Knife Wounds, Neighbors Report to Police, Body Removed for Examination, Murderer at Large, Room in Disarray</h3>
<p>Chen Aimei, a young woman of 29, worked as a dancer at the Huideng Ballroom. She resided in Room 11 on the upper floor of Building 109 in Jing'an Villa on Jing'an Temple Road. The woman was quite attractive, so she had many admirers. Previously, Aimei had lived there with her older sister. However, her older sister was violent and had been reported to the police by neighbors for mistreating a servant several months ago,</p>
<p>leading to her prosecution for assault and imprisonment. Therefore, Aimei</p>
<p>lived alone</p>
<p>in the residence. Around 8:50 p.m. last night, residents on the lower floor of Building 109 heard noises coming from Room 11. Because each person minds their own business, they did not investigate further. After a while, everything went silent. However, soon after, they heard faint groans,</p>
<p>arousing suspicion.</p>
<p>They went upstairs and knocked on the door, but it was locked from the inside and there was no response. Looking through the keyhole, they saw Chen Aimei lying on the bed, the room in disarray. Believing that she had taken poison, the residents immediately telegraphed the police and requested an ambulance. Police officers managed to open the door and enter the room. Unexpectedly, they found no one else inside. The woman was lying in a pool of blood, which had splattered everywhere. There were five or six knife wounds on her body, and she was already</p>
<p>dead.</p>
<p>A closer examination of the room revealed that everything was in disarray, as if there had been a struggle before her death. Police detectives, understanding the situation, immediately dismissed the ambulance and dispatched a hearse to take the woman's body to the hospital for a preliminary examination before transferring it to the coroner's office for an autopsy, pending a court-ordered examination. Meanwhile, detectives searched the woman's room for evidence to track down the murderer. According to nearby residents, two or four days prior, the woman had</p>
<p>A Young Man</p>
<p>had an argument at the side entrance of the building. Their dispute was quite heated. It turned out that the woman had an appointment with a male friend and had just dressed up and left the house. The young man also arrived in a car to pick her up, but she politely declined. The young man appeared displeased, and there were</p>
<p>Signs of Jealousy</p>
<p>in his words. The woman tried to explain, but she was unable to contain her anger and retorted. This sparked an argument that almost led to physical violence. Eventually, bystanders intervened, and the young man drove away angrily in his car. However, whether this is related to the case remains to be seen.</p>
<h3>Public Bus Accident, Driver Sentenced to Imprisonment</h3>
<p>On the 21st of last month, Public Bus No. 1506 on Route 5, due to the driver Hu Baozai's careless driving, crashed into the Hentaly Watch Store at the intersection of Henan Road and Nanjing Road. At the same time, it ran over and killed Hu Huanrong, who was riding a bicycle. The police prosecuted Hu Baozai in the Special First Court for causing death due to negligence in the course of his business. Hu Baozai hired lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Enliang to defend him. After the trial concluded, Judge Feng Shide announced the verdict in the First Criminal Court yesterday. Hu Baozai was sentenced to one year of imprisonment with a two-year suspended sentence. Police lawyer Ru Bao Yi requested that he be remanded in custody pending the appeal period. The court ordered Hu Baozai to be remanded in custody at the police station during the appeal period.</p>
<h3>Social Miscellany</h3>
<p>Around 7 a.m. yesterday, 18 bandits suddenly broke into a residence at 1032 Chengdu Road. Seven of the bandits pulled out pistols and threatened the occupants. They robbed them of clothing and cash worth approximately 5,000 yuan before fleeing without a trace. Afterward, the victims filed a list of stolen items and reported the incident to the local police station, requesting an investigation.</p>
<p>At 4646 Seymour Road, three bandits broke in at 9:50 a.m. yesterday. One of the bandits held a gun and ordered silence. They robbed them of over 600 yuan before fleeing. Li Zhenyuan (18 years old), a guest at the Southeast Hotel on Baike Road, suddenly slit his throat with a sharp blade in his room around 8 a.m. yesterday. He was discovered and rushed to the hospital, but he died because his throat was severed.</p>
<p>Yang Shicheng (21 years old), a Jiangbei native and a worker at the Riya Silk Factory at 1628 Pingliang Road in Pudong, was working when a large piece of iron fell from above and struck him in the chest. Due to the severity of the injury, he was taken to the Shanghai East Hospital, where he died.</p>
<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>Having recently read in your newspaper about eight burly men suddenly appearing at the Fusheng Entertainment Society in Wujiaochang, Caoyang, and arresting an accountant named Zhu Pinfang, the reason for which was unknown, I was deeply shocked. I have always been law-abiding and have been assisting in the Zhulongtai Noodle Shop established by my cousin to make a living. I have absolutely no involvement in the above situation. I believe that the report is inaccurate. I am deeply concerned that my friends and relatives may misunderstand the truth, so I am writing this letter requesting a correction. Sincerely, Zhu Pinfang. Witnessed by Wanshenghao.</p>
<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>In the Shanghai Local News section of your newspaper dated January 8, there was a news item about Chen Yuqin being shot. It mentioned that she had been a teacher at the Shanghai Chinese Girls' Middle School after the August 13th Incident. After investigation, there is no Chen Yuqin or Chen Yuqing among the faculty and staff of our school. I am writing to inform you accordingly, hoping that you will investigate and make a correction. Respectfully, Chinese Girls' Middle School, January 10th.</p>

<p>A Brief Discussion</p>
<h3>Everyone Talk</h3>
<p>— Huang Jiayin</p>
<p>The reason why so many foreigners read books, newspapers, and magazines is not only due to the popularity of education, but also to the precision and relevance of the selection of materials for Western magazines to life and society, as well as the lively style of writing. There is probably no one in the world who is not naturally fond of reading books and newspapers. The reason why fewer Chinese people read books and newspapers seems to be partly due to the fact that articles fail to arouse readers' interest.</p>
<p>Not only are there many readers abroad, but also writers are not limited to literary figures. Writers and reporters write articles, officials and dignitaries also write articles, teachers and students write articles, shop assistants and vendors also write articles, and even dancing girls, prostitutes, and vagrants write articles. Therefore, the range of their article materials is wider, and the interest is also stronger. We feel that this is something that our country's publishing industry should emulate.</p>
<p>There are more than 360 industries in the world, and it is impossible to become a champion in every one of them. Therefore, we can only rely on pens and ink, printing presses and paper, to convey our thoughts, to express our emotions, to laugh and scold, to cry and weep.</p>
<p>We believe that everyone has at least one good article to write. The question is whether or not they are willing to write it. Therefore, we hope that every Shen Bao reader writes an article, and every Free Talk reader writes an article.</p>
<p>Free Talk is a free and open garden. To encourage readers to write articles, we are launching "Free Micro-Essays" here first. The following are simple submission rules:</p>
<p>(1) Topic: Shanghai Like This (Please expose the contradictions and darkness of Shanghai society as you see it in your mind, and the sorrows and pains you have personally experienced, in a concise style without mercy)</p>
<p>(2) Word count: Do not exceed 500 words</p>
<p>(3) Style: Free</p>

<h3>A Brief Account of Burma</h3>
<p>— Da Nian</p>
<p>The visit of the Burmese delegation to China this time and the establishment of the Sino-Burmese Cultural Association in Chongqing can be said to be a major event in Sino-Burmese relations. This article tells us what kind of place Burma is. - Editor</p>
<p>It's eight o'clock in the morning, and your Burmese servant is calling you to get up. He will say to you, "The sun is already as high as a palm tree." The Burmese have always used this poetic phrase to represent eight o'clock in the morning. Similarly, the Burmese do not call late at night late at night; they call that time "when people don't walk."</p>
<p>The Burmese are poetic, so their temperaments are so amiable, and their lives are so happy and tasteful. They are the most fun-loving people in the Far East, always with a smile on their faces. Burma is full of temples and pagodas. They have been living their lives in the bell sound of the pagodas. The most wonderful teachings of Buddhism are also their philosophy. Geography books tell us that Burma is known for exporting rice, oil, and teak. However, tourists who occasionally come to Burma may not believe that the Burmese even have the time to export their native products, because except for September and December, the Burmese are busy eating, drinking, and having fun all the time. Frankly speaking, the Burmese are the least willing to do much work and the least willing to do it often. They let elephants do the logging work for them in the teak forests, let the Scots monopolize the oil industry, and let women take care of the rice fields for them.</p>
<p>Burmese women are as free and equal as men in society. They do more things than Burmese men and enjoy more benefits than men. The economic power of the family is in their hands. They have the right to vote in city elections. They can own private property, and they enjoy the same rights after marriage as men.</p>
<p>In Burma, neither men nor women wear trousers. They both wear a cotton short shirt on the upper body and a skirt on the lower body. The weekly needs of each family, including rent, are only about one shilling (approximately 4-5 yuan in national currency). Only clothing is considered a relatively expensive item for the Burmese.</p>
<p>The Burmese are generally wealthy, which can be seen from their fondness for cigars. Square-headed cigars can be bought for two shillings for a hundred in Burma. Because they are so cheap, almost everyone can afford them. Women can smoke as many as twenty a day when they have nothing to do.</p>
<p>In terms of entertainment, the Burmese love cockfighting and castrated cattle racing. The latter seems as interesting as turtle racing to foreigners.</p>
<p>Burma is the country with the fewest illiterates, with 87 percent of the people able to read and write. Because Burmese education is closely related to religion, many teachers are monks. The Burmese make their religion a source of happiness to suit their optimistic attitude.</p>
<p>Burma has all kinds of transportation and transportation tools. There are rickshaws, the latest model trams, and 2,000 miles of railways connecting all of Burma. The famous small fleet in the Irrawaddy River still travels to Mandalay from time to time. Although Burma has such complete means of transportation, the Burmese still think that sitting on the back of an elephant is the most enviable thing. The Burmese call elephants "brothers" because they believe that elephants are the most loyal animals.</p>
<p>Historical Anecdotes</p>
<h3>Who is Chen Yuanyuan?</h3>
<p>— Jiang Qi</p>
<p>"Chen Yuanyuan" will premiere tonight. The author of the play tells us here: Who is Chen Yuanyuan? - Editor</p>
<p>What kind of person is Chen Yuanyuan after all? Maybe someone will ask this question with concern.</p>
<p>Flipping through many biographies and unofficial histories, there are many derogatory words about Chen Yuanyuan, and very few who clear her name.</p>
<p>The saying that women are a source of trouble has been around for a long time. In addition, ancient poets and writers always like to especially emphasize and exaggerate the "love of heroes and beauties." Unfortunately, Chen Yuanyuan was not born with a harelip or pockmarks. Therefore, her beauty alone was enough to bear the crime of "overthrowing the country and the city."</p>
<p>However, that is not necessarily the whole truth. Historians have not completely erased their conscience. They wrote about how Wu Sangui was willing to shave his hair and keep a braid, surrender to the Manchus, how he bitterly pursued and forced Li Chuang to the point of exhaustion, and how cruelly and cruelly he personally killed the last drop of Ming blood, the Yongli Emperor. Unintentionally, we discovered the evidence that Wu Sangui did not completely betray his country and surrender to the enemy for Chen Yuanyuan. On the contrary, it tells us that Wu Sangui was mainly willing to overthrow the country because of his political ambitions.</p>
<p>If this reason is not sufficient, then I would like to cite the historical fact that Chen Yuanyuan entered the mountains to practice Taoism in her later years to end her remaining years to illustrate that Chen Yuanyuan was not favored and eventually died in depression. More decisively, I want to assert that Chen Yuanyuan was not a woman without a soul or understanding of righteousness.</p>
<p>Chen Yuanyuan was a famous prostitute in the Yu Feng troupe in her early years, but she was originally a lady from a wealthy family. She also knew poetry and etiquette when she was young. Because she suffered from the disaster of war and was abducted and sold by villains, this can be confirmed from many aspects. It is not too much to ask a Chen Yuanyuan who has read the books of sages and sages to understand the principles of heroic women sacrificing themselves for righteousness and great men serving the country with loyalty, right?</p>
<p>Wu Sangui, a young and promising hero and famous general, since Chen Yuanyuan married him, how passionately she loved him! She may not have known about his mid-way change of heart and surrender to the Manchus in advance, but afterward, would Chen Yuanyuan be willing to remain silent about this act that would be condemned for all ages? No, definitely not.</p>
<p>No matter what kind of loyal words Chen Yuanyuan had given to Wu Sangui, these loyal words had more or less influenced Wu Sangui's rebellion against the Qing Dynasty in his later years. Chen Yuanyuan, a weak woman without any status in the normal society, even if we cannot say that she has merit, at least, from all aspects of indirect evidence, I dare to say that she is innocent and pure.</p>

<h3>Hitler's Wartime Life</h3>
<p>— Wen He</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the European War, Hitler claimed to be "Germany's number one soldier." Now his day and night life is the life of "Germany's number one soldier."</p>
<p>From early morning to late at night, he is always discussing the war with military and diplomatic advisors. The discussion takes place in Hitler's newly built, heavily guarded Prime Minister's Office. A steel helmet is always hanging in his closet, so he can put on his commander-in-chief's uniform at any time.</p>
<p>Although his daily work is tense, his life is still as simple as before. He has issued food coupons to all Germans, but this has not affected his own simple food. At 7 a.m., he has his first breakfast: drinking some milk or juice, and eating two or three slices of toasted bread or jam bread. Two hours later, he has another breakfast, this time with some fresh fruit.</p>
<p>After the second breakfast, he begins to receive guests. Goering comes to see him almost every day, and Commander-in-Chief Keitel also comes in person to report on the situation on the front line. In addition, the people who come and go often include Dr. Diedrich, Director of the Press Bureau, Nazi No. 3 tycoon Hess, Hitler's personal representative, Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, returning ambassadors, and the staff of the Führer's personal staff.</p>
<p>At lunch, Hitler is often surrounded by several close friends. This meal is still very simple, usually some stewed vegetables. He does not eat meat, but he often has some light wine or light beer. After the meal, he receives guests again.</p>
<p>He only leaves the Prime Minister's Office when something is very important. He goes for a walk in the garden behind the building every day as a physical exercise. The sidewalk is covered, so he goes for a walk every time, regardless of the weather.</p>
<p>Hitler is a big movie fan. There is a screening room in the Prime Minister's Office, and he spends his nights watching movies: newsreels and newly released films from various countries.</p>

<h3>Garbo Helps Finland</h3>
<p>— Hua Zhi</p>
<p>The mysterious star Greta Garbo recently donated US$5,000 from her private funds, under the title of "Anonymous," to Finland, which has been invaded, as war funds, arousing great interest among people.</p>
<p>Garbo is originally from Sweden. She loves her motherland very much. Finland's invasion will directly affect Sweden's safety. Therefore, she was filled with righteous indignation and resolutely donated funds to help the Finns. According to rumors from Hollywood filmmakers, Garbo has donated a lot of money anonymously, and no one outside knows. Moreover, if Sweden is threatened and resists, she is ready to return home to serve.</p>
<p>Garbo used to be famous for her eccentricity. She liked to be indifferent, silent, and single. Few people knew that she had a patriotic flame hidden in her heart. It is said that she has recently started filming a comedy, which is based on a female spy in Moscow. The plot will be revised, and it will be completely changed into an anti-aggression film, with herself as the screenwriter and director.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Writings in the Art World</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>Yu Ling writes Daughter Country</p>
<p>The Shanghai Drama Society's "Motherland" and "Regret at the End of the Ming Dynasty" have been extended again and again, but the actors are no longer able to support it. In the last few days of the lunar New Year, Group B was transferred up. The run of "Chen Yuanyuan" naturally cannot be determined either. It is expected that at most one more play can be performed until the lunar New Year. Therefore, Yu Ling is burying himself in hard work, writing "Daughter Country," preparing to stage it in the New Year. Yu Ling has written "Girls' Apartment" and "Tears Splashed on Flowers," and this "Daughter Country" can be said to be a "women" trilogy.</p>
<p>Lan Lan on the screen again</p>
<p>Lan Lan once made a cameo appearance as Chen Peipei in Chen Kengran's "Girls' Apartment." After "Motherland" was taken down recently, she had a longer period of free time. Coincidentally, the Guohua Company was lacking an actress in "Dong Xiaowan," which was scheduled to be released on the lunar New Year, so they asked Shu Shi to discuss it with Lan Lan to make another cameo appearance. There are not many scenes in this role. According to Zhang Shichuan, it can be completed in a few days, and there is no problem catching up with the rehearsals for "Daughter Country." Lan Lan decided to agree to appear on the screen again.</p>
<h3>Announcement of Thunderstorm Lineup</h3>
<p>— Ti Gong</p>
<p>After the announcement of the "Thunderstorm" advertisement, the audience remained questioning. The reason for the delay in making the announcement was that Tian (probably a performer's name) had just returned from Chongqing and, after a short stay, was unable to participate in the performance. Repeated discussions and deliberations were held, and a final decision was reached only at midnight on the 6th, to present the following lineup:</p>
<p>Zhou Puyuan: Xin Fang</p>
<p>Fanyi: Su Wen</p>
<p>Zhou Ping: Ti Gong</p>
<p>Zhou Chong: Sang Hu</p>
<p>Lu Gui: Chang Shan</p>
<p>Hui Feng: Hui Cong</p>
<p>Shi Ping: Hui Lan</p>
<p>Da Hai: Bo Sui</p>
<p>Servant A: Da Lang</p>
<p>Servant B: Hai Sheng</p>
<p>Old Servant</p>
<p>Chang Shan is also a member of the Yi Feng troupe and should (a word missing, likely "originally") have been in the "Four Texts of Su Chen." (He) previously participated in performances with the China Arts Troupe in Hong Kong, and his portrayal of Lu Gui was widely praised as being no less than Jiang Ming's. This time, with his familiarity, success is assured. Bo Sui's change to the role of Da Hai, with his rough and straightforward personality, is fitting. Hui Lan, formerly the Ming opera actress Ma (missing part of name) Yun, has been praised by director Zhu Duanjun since rehearsals began as comparable to Ruo Qing. As for the polished and profound acting skills of Xin Fang, Su Wen, and Hui Cong, there is little need for further elaboration. The weaker ones are undoubtedly Sang Hu and myself. However, although the new recruits are tired, placing them in a battle-tested elite team may be enough to inspire them to forget themselves, strive to repay the country, and I and Sang Hu should encourage each other to live up to the earnest expectations of the gentlemen who appreciate our efforts.</p>
<h3>The Collective of Refugee Children: The Nanguang Opera Troupe</h3>
<p>— Wan Yu</p>
<p>The Nanguang Opera Troupe is organized by outstanding refugee children from all the Shanghai shelters. Their goal is "to struggle out of danger and strive for light!" It is evident that, at this time and in this place, even the suffering children living in hardship are mobilizing collectively. For the sake of easier expression, their training emphasizes songs more than opera. In the eight months since its establishment, they have learned dozens of magnificent and inspiring songs that touch the heart, and have rehearsed nearly ten one-act plays, the scripts of which are also quite meaningful in their implicit and natural expression.</p>
<p>In the past, they have performed extensively at Jinghua Middle School, the YMCA, and at memorial programs of various children's organizations, once, twice, and three times. The achievements have given them great encouragement, which in turn has inspired them to continue. In addition, they respond to invitations from various parties, implement a "little teacher" system, and serve as teachers in many places where children gather.</p>
<p>Now, in addition to receiving general education every day, they devote their remaining time to opera. Their only mentor is that young man, whose face never shows a trace of fatigue, named Mr. Gao Ge.</p>
<h3>A Wonderful Film Starring Entirely Women: Snippets of "The Women"</h3>
<p>— Xu Xu</p>
<p>The film "The Women," produced by MGM with all its might, has not a single male fly in it. The actors are of course female, and even the cats, dogs, and other livestock are all female. The photographs hanging on the walls and the decorations displayed on the cabinets are all feminine. The books on the shelves in the library are all by female authors.</p>
<p>Norma Shearer, Joan Crawford, and Rosalind Russell, the three leading ladies, are the three fragrant shoes in "The Women." One is a virtuous wife who manages the household well, one is a charming enchantress, and one is a gossipy troublemaker. Charlie Chaplin's wife, Paulette Goddard, also plays a very important role in "The Women."</p>
<p>Joan Crawford's bathing scene took a full eleven hours to shoot. The bathtub was the latest style of glass, filled with artificial foam. Joan Crawford was completely naked, and her performance was very impressive. Because the specially made soap foam only lasted for five minutes, Joan Crawford spared no effort, waiting for the artificial foam to be processed and manufactured each time. As a result of overwork, she slept for two full days after filming this scene and lost six pounds.</p>
<p>The valuable jewelry, worth US$50,000, was protected by bodyguards all around during filming to prevent any accidents.</p>
<p>The costumes were all the latest styles of 1940, numbering between two hundred and thirty to seven. The set had thirty-five halls. The 1,300-square-foot beauty salon was fully equipped with massage exercises, bathing, and facials.</p>
<p>The most exciting scene is the women's fight, in which both sides roll up their sleeves and arms, first slap each other, then grab each other's hair, one hating to pull down her underpants, and the other hating to bite her. It appears on the screen for less than a thousand feet, but it took three days to film before it was successfully completed. "The Women" will be released soon at the Dahua Grand Theater, so wait and see!</p>
