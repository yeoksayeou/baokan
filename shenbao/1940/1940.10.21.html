<p>社評</p>
<h3>在進行中之美蘇談話</h3>
<p>最近數日，蘇聯的塔斯社幾乎每天由蘇聯當局授權闢謠；查玫那些謠諑的來源，民治國與同盟國各居其半，此外雖也有來自中立國方面的消息，但也各自淵源於各交戰國某一方面的立塲。這固然是蘇聯本身態度微妙與處境錯綜使然，要亦足見在最近國際角逐當中，蘇聯最爲舉足重輕、且形成國際雙力陣營競相羅致的主要對象。再推究這些離奇紛披謠詠的效果，非惟不足以影響蘇聯對外立塲，且在另一意識之下，很可能的，使蘇聯愈益增加其矜持與審愼，愈益認爲超然於一切國際紛爭之外爲得計。</p>
<p>自從三國締盟以來，關於蘇方態度，本報已屢爲詳盡之論列，昨日復就英德對蘇外交試爲剖析，斷言今後；巴爾幹局勢的發展，其關鍵端在英德對蘇外交之消長；同時，與此一角逐平行存在着的，則有美日對蘇談判的競賽；而此後太平洋局勢之安危亦無疑的大半視乎此一談判的前途而轉移。現在國際的分野，雖已遠較前此爲鮮明，亞歐雙方所進行着的戰爭也有日趨接近之勢；而同盟國家之於蘇聯，旣已於盟的中暗示其並小因締盟而產生新的的束，蘇聯之於個別同盟國，亦未必不因其間緩急輕重關係之不同而予以差別的應付。假如巴爾幹與黑海形勢再告緊張，則徵之蘇方當局一貫的視西疆於東疆的傳統見解，殆將於美日同時對蘇聯進行的談判發生重大影響：或因一時策略而與日本姑相接近，使蘇日不侵協定的醞釀，獲得意外成就；或因根本矛盾而與日本對立尖銳，使國際錯綜混沌之局，不復持續；這兩種趨歸，實屬背道而馳，然居今日而平心論其可能性，則各居一半與一半。日來美國方面的輿情，似已因美蘇關係的依然沉滯無所進展而微示其不耐，甚且流露其怨懟之情：由此推演，當然變幻不可端倪：謂必蘇聯將親日而疎美，自是武斷而誇妄；然謂美蘇聯合制日之局，必可實現，亦近逾分樂觀；總之，前途未可知也。</p>
<p>以近頃國際情勢而論，任何國家對外政策絕不容把感情上的好惡和實際上的利害雜揉在一起而不加分辨；這一點，知之最切且運用最精嚴者，無如德國，顯非民治國家所能企及。納粹黨反共反蘇的基本抱負，並小妨害其對蘇不侵協定的締結；此一作風，日本的右翼政客軍人現在正竭力試行學步。而在民治國家，則大資產者的反共直覺，反而往往有時妨礙有利對外政策的遂行，這是若干年來最可痛心的現象，時屆今日，非促使其澈底省覺不可。此際美日之於蘇聯，頗與去歲八月以前英法與德國對蘇聯的外交角逐的略相似，彼時英法蘇三國互助之議，久久無所成就，而蘇德不侵協定的締結反而有水到渠成之觀，蘇聯曾經以此招致國際反侵略份子的反感，但平心而論，這並非蘇聯於英法及德國兩個敵對陣營之間有所偏袒，而實由於該兩建議本質上的不同。互助協定是積極的，結果義務必不免多於權利；不侵協定是消極的，　足以確保自身一時間的安全；任何國家如果專爲自身一時利害着想而不計其他，無疑不侵協定當較助互公的易被接受。目前美日雙方的對蘇談判，美政府固不像彼時英當局之欠缺誠意，且已以相當經濟利益給予蘇聯，但美方之所需求於蘇者亦較日本之僅求互不侵犯者較進一步（如果日方要求超出互不侵犯範圍之外，預料亦絕無成功可能），則兩者間談判的難易亦必致影響釗此一三角關係的前途。但這同樣也並不是蘇聯於美日之間的親疏軒輊適與世人意念相反，而恰是「中立和平政策」與避免火中取栗的自然結果。</p>
<p>假如蘇當局的考慮恰與上述推測相符合，則蘇聯主觀上的「中立和平」，在客觀上自不免在另一地帶發生侵略和擾攘的後果；因爲這一「不侵」的保障，正是懷有大欲者用以減除後顧之憂而恣行侵略的號誌。是以世人之切望　當局於此特加審愼將事，正無以異於期待美國某一部分人士之修正其反蘇直覺。</p>
<p>以吾人之見：所謂共同對日問題應該只佔美蘇談判當中的一部分。要知道其間更重要的中心任務，却應該是彼此緊密配合的共同援華。因爲蘇美之間，只有關於援華一點，必可獲得絕對一致，而且援華的結果，一面是直接的利己，一面是間接的制日。藉令蘇日不侵協定眞告成立，只要蘇聯不改變其一貫堅決援華的宣示，則此一紙空文協定所能給予日本的實際裨益終屬有限，絕不足與蘇美共同援華的效果相提並論；而蘇聯在太平洋上所分擔的牽制作用，亦將由中國發揮更大的功效。這是目前美蘇談話中，必已爲雙方所體認明白的。</p>

<h3>溫莎公的新職</h3>
<p>「不愛江山愛美人」的溫莎公，即英遜王愛德華八世，自與美國籍的辛博森夫人結褵以來，鶼鶼蝶蝶，常常厠守在一起形影不離，眞不愧爲世界上第一對有情眷屬。他們原在法國作寓公，歐戰爆發後，曾遄返視國效勞，初任英法聯軍聯絡官，旋由其弟喬治六世，授以巴哈馬總督之職，同時爲對於美國的一個意義深長的「親善使命」。溫莎公欣然受命，已於八月初離歐赴百慕大島轉巴哈馬；十七日在首都拿沙行官誓授職禮。以這樣一個棄王冠如敝屣，曾經哄動過全世界人士耳目的英遜王，來到這大西洋小島，作一個民政總督兼海陸軍總司令，單就人物而論，已大有號召之力，又經美國報紙力加煊染，一時好奇心殷，和表同情於溫莎公的美國人士，趁着熱鬧，競作巴哈馬之遊，所謂「人傑地靈」者，詢屬不誣。茲根據“The　New　YorK　Times”“The　Christian　ScienceMonitar”及“Time”各報的紀載，譯述如决：</p>
<p>以巴哈馬總督的職位與大不列顚王位相比較，眞可謂如小巫之見大巫了。巴哈馬羣島在古巴之東北，除首都拿沙所在的「新省」一島之外，尙包括一十八個小島，六百六十一個巖礁，及散處在大西洋中之礁脈二千餘處。英遜王愛德華八世從前所轄治的不列顚領土計有一千三百三十二萬餘方哩，人民的四萬萬九千五百萬；現在呢，巴哈馬島的面積的爲四千六百六十六方哩，全人口的六萬七千人，其中四分之三的人民居於「新省」。</p>
<p>溫莎公所放棄的王位，與現在親任的總督，其間大少輕重的懸殊已不可以道里計，姑置不論；還有奇怪的事情，就是他所宣誓效忠，順服聽命的對象，即是他的胞弟喬治六世。奇人多奇事，溫莎公亦可當之而無愧色。</p>
<p>離歐赴百慕大的一天，他們夫婦倆所乘的爲載重九千三百五十九噸，客貨兼搭的輪船「愛克斯喀立勃」號。橫渡大西洋一决，全程須航行八天。這船雖是隻貨船，這一决倒着實裝載了些貴客，那張乘客名單，領銜的爲溫莎公夫婦？美國駐義大使費立普及其女公子，美國駐波蘭大使皮特爾夫婦，美國駐荷蘭公使戈登夫婦等要人。</p>
<p>溫莎公爵夫人係在葡京斯里本登船，隨身帶了三隻小獵犬，五十二件行李，一架手搖縫衣機，高爾夫球棍，四隻滿裝上好遠年葡萄酒的柳條籃，一輛一九四〇年式的汽車及家庭式拖車。至於溫莎公則在葡國鉅商雪爾伐家裏酬酢，遲遲始到碼頭。這艘「愛克斯喀立勃」號只好等待暫不啟椗，在碼頭上預備恭送的尙有好幾位大老，像英國駐葡大使薛爾倍夫婦等人，也只好等在那裹。英國王室第一條家規說：「準時爲帝王謙遜之表示」，而這位溫莎公却是放浪不羈，十足遲延了四十分鐘之久，纔見他和東道主雪爾伐等施施而來。和他一同上船的，尙有三位僚屬，都是伊頓出身的老同學</p>
<p>公爵本人最好搭乘「飛剪」號飛船橫跨大西洋，但是他的夫人常常堅持着說「我不願坐飛機」。溫莎不欲過拂他太太的意思，這是無可諱言的，而在公爵夫人方面，實在另有緣故。原來辛博森夫人三位前夫中，會有一位擔任過美國海軍飛機駕駛員，她對於飛機肇禍的事，不但耳熟能詳，抑且目曾經覩。因之她痛恨飛機，像她不願意看到貓」般。她常說：「我祝禱火車不耍有停頓的一天」</p>
<p>自里斯本啟椗後，風和日暖，浪寂水平，大舟行於海洋，宛若溫莎夫人理想中的火車一樣。未幾·頂上有一架「飛剪號飛過，在空中發着吼聲。溫莎公爵上昇船橋，對着那飛船揚手示意，並與飛船船長用無綫電交換祝詞。飛船上也有一位貴客，這時他正在休息，沒有注意到在輪船上揚手的溫莎公。他是出國避難的法國財閥羅斯吉爾男爵，愛德華遜位之後，未與辛博森夫人結婚之前，曾一度住在他別墅中，過了若干時間的退隱生活。</p>
<p>溫莎夫婦在船七住着套間式的房艙，還有一個私用陽台。他們曾招待同船的美國外交家夫婦私宴，但亦不時牽着犬在公共甲板上散步。溫莎公爵夫人與美國駐荷蘭公使戈登夫人。原是在華盛頓相識的老友。戈登太太阿麗斯本是富室之女，往年每次由歐洲返美，總要從巴黎帶轉許多時裝衣服。辛博森夫人那時手頭並不寬裕，當然無力購買巴黎最新時裝，阿麗斯却常叫她喊個女裁縫來，儘量的把那些時裝依樣葫蘆的「考貝」。因之兩人情投意合，交非泛泛了。一</p>
<p>八月八日到達百慕大，溫莎夫婦上岸，五十多件行李也一併登陸。但這些箱籠物件，還不過是私人日用品而已。單就「公事」行李中的制服，徽章，寳星綬帶等而論，就有好幾箱之多。溫莎公已把這些物事一起擱在法國，沒有搬運出境。</p>
<p>八月十四日，溫莎公夫婦，搭乘加拿大輪船公司的「索茂士夫人」號，由百慕大啟程赴巴哈馬履新。紐約泰晤士報記者隨船同行，在二日半之海程中，得與溫莎夫婦有晋接之機會。其觀察所得，大概如决</p>
<p>自百慕大往巴哈馬七百八十英里，沿途有英國輕巡洋艦保護，那軍艦駛行起來忽東忽西，到處偵察。「索茂士夫人」號於星期三下午二時啟椗，一路駛行，並未發生事故。十六日午後，東水平綫上忽然發現一股濃烟，那艘巡洋艦便朝東駛出，窺探究竟。後來發現那股烟原來是一艘美國油船的烟囱裹冒出來的。這時候公爵夫婦正坐在甲板的椅子上，看見船員們拿望遠鏡向東窺察不已，便發問道：「是不是要開火」？</p>
<p>每到夜間，全船熄燈，在甲板上抽烟亦在禁止之例。船上乘客不多，大家倒還消遙目然。溫莎公夫婦與緻頗好。（未完）</p>

<h3>試論戰後中國之對外收支平衡</h3>
<p>— 余崇賢</p>
<p>奇蹟乎？必然性乎？</p>
<p>中國對外作戰，已屆四十閱月：但中國法幣之對外匯價，雖一無武裝配備，且處於四面受敵的地位；但仍能泰然自若，中外之觀察者，無不認此爲戰爭金融史上之奇蹟。純從經濟的觀點出發，中國法幣之對外滙價（指上海之黑市匯率而言），殊無長時期站定於現有水準之理由。單就上海一埠之對外貿易而言，每月入超，近來常在三百萬鎊以上。而全國之貿易入超，近月來每月亦常逾六百萬鎊。上海本埠之入超，固應自上海之外滙市塲中搜求頭寸以支付；至於其他各地之入超，亦有一部份經由各地對上海之滙兌，而在上海之外匯市塲中實現對外之支付。上海一地之外滙供給，非可以取之不窮用用不竭竭，故從此種觀點出發者，殆無不　中國貨幣之對外匯價，殊無不往下崩跌之理由。然而事實上上海黑市中之法幣匯率，仍能始終表現其堅强之抵抗力量；於有利之機會時，且能挺勁上漲；其所以爲戰時金融史上之奇蹟者，卽在於此。</p>
<p>可以能有此種景象？在目前實無任能作出可以使人滿意之解釋，或以爲數月來滙率之堅挺，原因在國內外局勢變幻莫測，不時有利空事實之突發，盛利空傳言之流佈。然利空事變雖接續發生，利空傳說雖不絕如縷，但其作用當僅如人身之施用刺激藥劑，屬暫時性質；法幣匯率，決不能長藉流言以支持。就長時間言，空洞之傳言，決不能抗阻經濟上之壓力；故法幣滙率之穩定，當屬另有原因。</p>
<p>在任何情形下，有形之入超，均應以無形之收入支付之。滙率能保持穩定，卽等於說吾人之對外收支，能支持現有之滙價水準。而事實上吾人有形貿易之輸進出，有如許巨額之入超，是必吾人無形貿易之收支，有數額相同之剩餘；非然者，滙率必將不能保持。目前所應硏究者：卽爲構成此無形收入之項目爲何？其仲縮之彈性，變動之方向又如何？如能於此有透澈之硏究，則對於中國戰時對外滙價趨向之認識，當有甚大之貢獻。然此事之進行甚難，原因在關涉問題之複雜，與若干前提問題之非費極長之調查時間不易解決。故在目前要作透澈的硏究，殊爲事實所不可能，茲就筆者個人見解，對此問題略作陳述。</p>
<p>戰時有形收支比較</p>
<p>中國有形貿易向爲入超，但中國之對外收支，不能長期虧空；是以必有其平衡之方法。目前所應硏究者，卽爲此種平衡方法，是否仍然存在？數額有無變更？同時觀察現在之入超數額，與過去之入超數額比較，增如减伺？是吾爲現尙存在之平衡收支方法所能抵補？如此反證，似可明瞭其大概、茲分別言之。</p>
<p>請先測度吾人對於歷來入超之支持能力如何？此一問題之研究，應以歷史資料作爲參考，據筆者粗略之計算，自一九二〇年至一九二九年之十年中，中國每年平均之入超額的爲二萬萬元。照此十年中的略之平均滙率計算，每年的爲二千萬鎊有零；每月的爲一百八十萬鎊。惟一九三〇年以後，入超額迅速增加，自一九三〇年至一九三六之七年中，每年平均入超額的爲五萬萬元；照此七年中的略之平均滙率計算，每年的爲三千六百萬英鎊，每月平均百三百萬鎊。如將此十七年併爲一時期計算，則每年之平均入超的爲二千七百萬鎊，每月平均的爲二百二十五萬鎊。吾人之對外收支，旣不能長爲虧空，而必有平衡之方法，是必吾人在此十七年中，其他項目之收支，必有與此數額的略相等之剩餘。非然者，貿易上及滙兌上將不能圓滑進行。</p>
<p>然有形貿易之虧空，旣必以無形貿易之收支剩餘以爲抵補；則在此十七年中，我國之對外無形貿易，每年必有數額的近二千七百萬鎊之剩餘；每月平均之無形收支剩餘，當在二爲二十萬鎊左右。如單就一九三〇年以後之情形計算，則每年平均之無形收支剩餘，應爲三千六百萬鎊，每月平均爲三百萬鎊。蓋長期間之收支必歸平衡，此爲國際收上之定則。如此吾人可以假定上述之平均數，爲我國平常時期忍受商品入超之力量。（Ability　to　foartd　import　surplus　of　commodityrradfng　items）吾人之有形貿易入超，如超乎上述之平均數字，則吾人之對外收支將出現虧空；外滙準備，將受侵蝕。如吾國幣制當局，不願以外匯準備售出，供平衡此項入超之用；則吾人之對外滙率，將被壓低。反是，如吾人有形貿易之入超，低於上述之數字；則我國之國際收支，將有剩餘；外滙準備將更充實；如幣制當局拒絕照定價吸淮外滙，則我國之對外匯價將被擠高。根據上述歷史材料之計算，吾人卽可進而討論戰後之問題。</p>
<p>戰前國際收支大勢</p>
<p>於此有二問題値得注意者：戰後有形入超與戰前比較之增减情形如何？一爲構成吾人無形收入之內容，在戰後有無變化？及其變化之可能限度如何？將此兩變數加以估定，然後觀察其盈虧之情形，當可明瞭戰後收支之大體情形矣。茲分別言之如次。</p>
<p>第一，先從有形貿易之入超方面言：自民國二十六年開戰後計算至現在，每年之平均入超，折合英鎊計算，的爲四千五百萬鎊，每月平均之入超數額，的爲三百八十萬鎊弱。以此數與戰前十七年之平均數字比較，每年入超額的增加一千八百萬鎊，每月平均的增加一百五十萬鎊，如單與戰前七年之平均數字相較，則每年之入超額的增加九百萬鎊，每月平均增加八十萬鎊，時代遠者不足爲憑，故以後者之計算爲立論根據，似較爲可靠。總上所述，知我國戰後之有形入超，確比戰前增加，且稍微超過前所計算吾人正常時期所能忍受人超之力量；每年的超過九百萬鎊，每年平均的超過八十萬鎊弱。此從吾人之支出方面言者。</p>
<p>戰時無形收支比較</p>
<p>其决請冉行分析我國無形收入之內容，及其在戰後可能發生之變化茲先說明原有收入項目之變遷，至後再申述戰後新增之項目。</p>
<p>按中國無形收入之主要項目有二：一爲華僑滙款，一爲外人在華之用費。前者戰前估計每年的在三萬萬至五萬萬元之間，而後者一般估計亦在一萬萬元以外照戰前法幣對外之法定滙率計算，則華僑滙款，每年的在二千二百萬鎊至三千萬鎊之間；外人在華用費，則的爲八九百萬鎊。因各家估計稍有參差，吾人茲採折中而較爲概括之說法，假定此兩項在戰前每年之所得爲三千五百萬鎊，此己的略可以與戰前七年間每年之有形貿易入超相抵。</p>
<p>吾人茲所欲研究者，卽爲此種收入在戰後之增减如何？茲先說華僑滙款：按閩越之沿海城市，雖多淪陷，但滙款之通路未斷，惟困難稍爲增加而已。戰後因物價之高漲及遷移費用之增多，僑民之滙款供給家用者，當非增加其數額不可。但此一因素又當爲外幣之騰價所抵消；因同量之外幣可滙得較多之法幣也。此外又有一部份僑民家屬遷移香港或海外，故戰後之華僑滙款，以法幣計算，數當大增；如以外幣計算，或反有减少。但於此又有一點値得注意者，卽僑民愛國情殷，戰後對政府獻捐之數額，頗爲可觀。據估計政府由此所得之外幣收入，戰後三年中總計的在五千萬萬元以上。如此數抵充私人滙款减少之數，似可有餘。故戰後之華僑滙款數似未减而反微有增加；最少可以假定其並未减少。</p>
<p>關於外人在華之用費，戰後似有减少；原因在各地外人之退出及駐軍之减撤。惟其减少之數當亦無多，因戰後具特殊目的而來華之外人爲數頗多；其新增之支出可以抵補原有外人用費之减少一部份也。且戰後外人對我國醫藥救濟等之獻捐爲數頗多；此之累總扯計，戰後外人在華之用費或亦反有增加。</p>
<p>總上分析，可知我國無形收入之剩餘對於有形入超之抵補力量，戰後似未較戰前减弱。苟戰後之有形入超仍保持戰前之水準，則戰後之收支平衡可以不生困難。惟如上所述，吾人戰後之有形人超實較戰前增加。三年來累計的增加三千餘萬鎊。此數究竟如何平衡？同時且仍能有巨額外滙爲人民所握存，此又將如何加以解釋？凡此皆爲筆者最後所要說明者。</p>
<p>關於此點，吾人似應於戰後新增之收入項目加以硏究。此新增之收入項目爲何？茲舉之如决：</p>
<p>政府一部份外滙準備金之措置。按戰事開始至翌年三月實行外滙審核制時止，政府爲穩定滙市所出售之外滙，估計達二千萬鎊左右。此後在施行外滙審核制期中，又先後措置的五百萬鎊；自前年八月作穩定滙市之企圖後，以至中英平準會活動時期中售出而未曾買回之外滙，估計亦在五百萬鎊左右。是政府在此三中放出之外滙頭寸，亦已在三千萬鎊之間。此數已足平衡戰後有形與無形收支相加後之總收總支差額。</p>
<p>就上推算，加上政府所措置之外滙，戰後三年間。我國對外之總收總支，似可平衡。然則上海以仍有一部份外滙爲民間所握存？此殆可視爲過去三年間之收支積餘，因未曾用爲對外支付之用也。但何以必仍有其他之收入，此部份之外滙始可未被動用？關於此點，本人有如下之意見：</p>
<p>（一）戰後有數額相當巨大之法幣，流往海外變價；此當爲構成吾人新增的收入之一。估計流往香港之法幣，除政府所有者不計外，的爲四萬萬元，折價的爲一千萬鎊。</p>
<p>（二）南洋一帶之資金（香港在內），近一年來頗有內流。此一數額現雖不能作出可靠之估計，但總數必相當可觀。以上二因素對於吾人三年來何以有對外剩餘？（卽上海民間有一部份外滙未用）關係似頗重要。</p>
<p>上面係本人對於三年來中國對外收支平衡試作之解釋。由此可知吾人可以抵付有形入超之無形收入，戰後較之戰前並未减少。惟吾人之有形入超，較戰前之牛均水準略有减加；但並未减加至不能支持之地步。此殆爲我國法幣對外滙價所以於經過三年之長期戰爭後，仍能保持於一相當穩定之水準上，今父大步回鬆之一種內在偉力歟。</p>
<p>者按：上海黑滙市塲之波動，買不能完全以國際收支情形加以解釋；而滙市之變動，則反能影響國際收支。統制外滙以前滙市之穩定，余先生指爲政府充分供給之結果，所論極然，惟當時入超額不若今日之大，而國外捐款獻金之數則實大，所惜開戰前後資金外逃者亦極鉅，然兩者相抵，縱仍虧空，恐亦不大。故所謂政府因維持而所受之損失，亦未必甚大。但實施匯兌統制乃至發生黑滙市塲後，情形卽大變，因黑滙與法價之距離闊度愈大，資金之逃避性與投機性之程度亦愈高；資金逃避之動力，除出之經濟的觀點外，必又出之政治的觀點。而投機熱度之亢進，苟有切實之取締，則必不致此；故亦可謂爲與政治有關。資金逃避性與投機性之增大，乃大大影響於國際收支；更反射其影響於黑滙市塲，終於造成今日之現象。時至今日，情形則又不同，蓋由政治觀點而誘發之資金逃避的現象，業已减少，甚至歛跡；且多流回，資金逃避之减退，外滙之多頭投機陣綫於焉動搖；外加逃避資金之回歸，益增强空頭投機之陣錢。而國際戰雲密佈，戰機日迫；今後國際貿易之軍行可能性益小，外滙之需耍更受影饗。此等事實，心理上更足以助長空頭勢力。故依余所見，黑滙價變動，非國際收支之結果；而國際收支之現狀，則反受黑滙價之影響；而黑滙市塲，主要者乃由投機商所構成；而此項投機商之觀點，什九都是悲觀論者。故與其以經濟觀點來分析黑滙市塲上所表現之法幣購買力，母寗以政治觀點解釋之幾近似。惟在黑滙市塲影響下之我國國際收支情况爲何如？則余先生此文所貢獻諸點，頗多獨具慧眼之處矣。</p>
<h3>我國戰時財政（續完）</h3>
<p>— 兪爕麟</p>
<p>戰時公債政策之適宜</p>
<p>按各國戰時財政之成例，應付戰費之支出，取自增稅者少，而取自募債者多。因募債合乎敏捷，簡便之原則，能於短時期內募集鉅款，以應付非常時期之突變，或戰時浩大戰費之支出，此爲租稅所莫及者也。但若將戰費，全仰給於公債，則其發行逾量，其必陷於惡性通貨膨脹，上屆大戰時德法之之覆轍，尙不連也。是故戰時公債政策，偶一不旗，其必遺害無窮。是故我國財政當局，對於公債政策，素採穩健態度，終始未有鉅額之發行，使國民經濟受莫大之害。我國自開戰以來，先後發行二十六年救國公債五萬萬元；二十七年國防公債五萬萬元；二十七年金公債內計關金一萬萬單位，英金一千萬鎊，美金五千萬元，按政府所定價格折合，的爲國幣五萬五千餘萬元；二十七年賑濟公債一萬萬元，第一期發行三千萬元，二十八年建設公債六萬萬元：二十八年軍需公債六萬萬元；二十九年建設金公債，內引英金一千萬鎊，美金五千萬元，按政府所定價格折合，的爲國幣七萬萬餘元；二十九年軍需公債十二萬萬元。合計亦不過西十七八萬萬元而已，目尙有一部份，實際上尙未發行，如二十九年建設金公債分兩期發行，第二期須於本年十一月一日發行。以此數量，與日本相較，實屬微甚。由上述可得下列之特點。（一）抗戰至去年，卽第二時期，政府對於抗戰建國，同等重，故發行軍需公債以應付戰費，發行建設公以從事建國。（二）發行金公債，以吸收國內人民所有之外滙或外幣，以及便於海外華僑之購買，籍以充實法幣準備，及增强我國戰時對外之買購力。（三）在此戰時，政府尙不忘地方所受之天災，故發行賑濟公債以救濟遭受黃河水災之人民觀乎我國戰時公債之發行條例，又可得下列之特點：（一）利率較低，如救國公債烏二釐，此堪稱我國內債史上之創舉，一十七年金公僓爲四釐，二—九年建設金公債爲五釐，其餘者仍爲六釐。（二）折扣减低，戰時公債僅二十七年賑濟公債九八發行，二十九年軍需公債九四發行，其餘者均爲十足發行，此實爲我國公債制度之一大改革也。我國戰時公債之　行，反能較平時公債减低利息，降　折扣，此種現象，徵諸中外史乘，實屬罕　。此實因我國財政之漸臻健全，與人民之踴躍認購。</p>
<p>語云：「得道者多助一。我國爲世界正義而戰，故英美人士對我國之抗戰，咸表同情，並給我財政上上援助。如一十七年叫月之鐵路借款一萬萬五千萬法郞，十叫萬四千鎊；同年之蘇聯兩决易貨借款萬萬美元：同年十一月之美國借款二千五百萬　元；二十八年一月之英國貨幣借款五百萬鎊。其業經成立而未經官方發表者，爲數尙多。其餘一部份係以視金還本付息者，大部均採易貨方式。外資如此之利用，對於我國建設之推進，必有莫大之助益。且於還本付息之際，不足以加重財政上之負擔，並能改善國際收支平衡。</p>
<p>戰時發行制度之穩健</p>
<p>籌集戰費之方法，除增稅募債之外，尙有發鈔。若賴於發鈔以應付浩大之戰費，其雖最爲方便，但亦最危險。其最易造成惡性通貨膨脹，使財政趨於崩潰，無法自拔。故我國戰時之發行，仍採過去之穩健政策。當二十六年六月底—戰爭爆發之前中—中中交農四　發行總額爲十四萬萬零七百二十萬零千二百三十四元，當時之現金準備爲九萬萬一千六百五十一萬八千三百五十三元，比例爲百分之六十五强。至二十七年六月底，發行總額爲十七萬萬二千六百九十九萬七千八百三十五元，現金準備惟十一萬萬三千二百八十一萬一千零六十七元，其比例仍爲百分六十五强、至一十八年六月底，發行總額爲二十六萬萬二千六百九十二萬九千二百元，現金準備爲十一萬萬五千六百零八萬八千九百七十四元，比例爲百分之四十四。今年六月底，發行總額爲三十九萬萬六千一百十四萬四千二百零五元，現金準備爲十九萬萬一千七百五十二萬六千零五時元，比例爲百分之四十八强。由表面觀之，三載以來，法幣之發行數額增加二倍。但因法幣之流通區域日益推廣，各地對於通貨之需要日益殷切？發行數額，自當增加。在戰前發行數額，本屬太少，在內地各省均感籌碼不足。而現今發行數量雖已激增，但各地尙時有通貨緊縮之感。可知我國發行數額，非但尙未逾量也。至於現金準備之百分數雖已降低，但至今尙任百分之四十八以上，較之先進各國，有過之而無不及。至於存銀之收兌，金產之增加，且將所收之金銀，悉充發行準備，故現金準備亦能隨發行總額迅速增加，而使法幣之基礎，益臻鞏固。</p>
<p>結論</p>
<p>經濟落後與財政困乏之我國，竟能抗戰三載，對於浩大之戰費，竟能應付裕如，毫無困難，此實出乎衆人意料之外。由此可見我國潛勢力之偉大矣。我國財政當局能於萬分困難之際，埋頭苦幹，改善稅制，廣募公債，運用發鈔，以應付浩繁之戰費。俾我財政制度日臻健全，財政基礎日益鞏固。端緒方開，尙待繼續努力。</p>
<h3>蘇聯貿易子都</h3>
<p>— 武堉幹　先生答</p>
<p>沈承昭君：承詢各問題，除蘇德金融制度，業於本刊前期答復外，關於蘇德貿易制度，早經國際貿易專家武堉幹敎授代答，關於德國者，已於上期發表，續蘇聯部份，茲續將發表如决：</p>
<p>蘇聯與英美國際貿易方式有何不同？，</p>
<p>蘇聯與英美國際貿易不同之點，自是蘇聯的國外貿易，完全由國家來經營，並且是由國家獨佔；而英美各國却是由民間自由經營。蘇聯的國際貿易是把貿易指導，組織，計劃，經營一切有關的事情，都由國家辦理。由她的貿易的中央機關（對外貿易人民委員會）和其他重要機關如對外商務代表等，指導一切，又組成許多的公司。把進口和出口的業務，都分配結這些進出口貿易公司。關於對外定貨銷貨等事，都由這些公司出面辦理。不過對外定貨須經貿易人民委員會的特許（Licences）而出口只須報吿而已。又對於外國行家簽訂貿易協定等事，也嘗由政府授權辦理。這些公司大都各自經營不同性質之特種商品，如機械進口，完全委之於“Mlachinoimporc”進口公司，油類出口則全交給“Soyusneftoxport”出口公司；也偶有對於一定地域的進出口貿易，完全由一個公司經營的。牠們都是由貿易人民委員會來管理。蘇聯用這種國營貿易的方式，結果自是特別足以適應本國經濟的需要，而同時又很容易推進國際政治外交的關係，這是英美由民間自由經營貿易的方式所不及的地方。　（完）</p>

<h3>金融述評　—十月十九日—</h3>
<p>— 聖凱瓊</p>
<p>中·中·交四農四行聯合辦事總處，爲使儲蓄業務能够不僅在各大都普遍的推行，並且要能够廣泛地在各地較小的縣鎭及各種工商集中地去推行起見，特議決普設簡易儲蓄處辦法六條，由中央信託局及中·交，農三行積極籌設。</p>
<p>按四行聯合辦事總處自二十八年九月改組之後，在中國最高統帥蔣委員長的主持之下，對於擬定的戰時金融經濟大計，業已决第見諸實施，如推進貼放業務，設置金融網四行發行準備的公開檢查，金銀收兌工作的普遍推進。而目前的工作，則正集中在資金的集中及特種儲蓄的提倡。關於資金集中的辦法，最具體的是管理銀行辦法中的由四行收受各銀行存款的百分之二十底準備金；特種儲蓄提倡的辦法，是組織了一個節的建國儲蓄勸儲委員會，本年九月六日更與全國節的建國儲蓄運動委員會共同組織一個節的建國儲蓄團，及着由中信局與中·交·農三行積極籌設商易儲蓄處。</p>
<p>細讀簡易儲蓄處設立的辦法，覺得有三個特點是必須指出：第一是設立簡易儲蓄處的經濟環境不同於金融網所展佈的經濟環境，凡是（一）人口超過三萬以上並無任何金融機構的地方；（二）工人衆多的鑛區。或鐵路綫與公路綫工作集中的段站；（三）學校集中的文化區；（四）大宗特產品的生產地與集散地；（五）商務繁盛鈔券流通較多的內地口岸；（六）超過五百工人以上的大工廠。第二簡易儲蓄處雖然是和一般儲蓄銀行一樣可以辦理一切儲蓄業務，但主要的是偏於吸收存款，如特別注意於吸收小額存款，及推銷節的建國儲蓄券，以及有獎儲蓄券，滙兌及放款不過居於輔助地位，如小額滙兌，小額放款，在必耍時可以兼辦。第三簡易儲蓄處對於吸收儲款的利率，較之一般儲蓄銀行所吸收儲款的利率爲高，它以活期年利率五厘，定期年利率一分爲原則，並可參照地方情形酌量增减，不受一般儲蓄條例的限制。</p>
<p>由於上面所分析而得的三點，可知簡易儲蓄處在中國戰時金融上所具有的機能，是與管理銀行暫行辦法相同，而具有三大作用：（一）可使國家銀行增加存款，利用以開發資源和一切生產事業，所以簡易儲蓄處以收受存款爲主要，俾資金集中後，國家銀行得統籌運用；（二）可以節的消費减少社會上流通籌碼，平抑物價的上升，所以簡易儲蓄處訂定利率較一般銀行活定利率爲高；（三）可使法幣流通額减少，流回發行銀行以阻遏通貨膨脹；所以簡易儲蓄處設立的經濟環境，要在各地較小的縣鎮及各種工商集中地。</p>
<p>簡易儲蓄處不但具有管理銀行辦法的機能，也具有節的建國儲蓄的機能，並且具有補救管理銀行辦法和節的建國儲蓄兩者所不及地方的功能。以管理銀行辦法論，則其所能集中的資金，僅銀行所能集中的百分之二十，尙有散在民間的資金，並非銀行所能吸收，政府銀行更無從去吸收百分之二十的準備金；今以四行的聲譽普遍設立簡易儲蓄處，雖屬事繁，然較之僅能轉行吸收百分之二十，甚成績必遠超過這水準之上。至於節的建國儲蓄券，無論爲甲種爲乙種，均是定期性質，最短的存期是六個月，便於定期存款者，對於祗願存活期者卽感不便，今簡易儲蓄處以五厘年利率來吸收活期存款，存款者旣享受優厚的利息，又得存取隨時的便利，更得資金安全的保障，簡儲處不營其私人的銀庫，結果必能大量集中資金，而發揮前面所論的三大作用。</p>
<p>所以四行普設簡易儲蓄處，實在是全國儲蓄網的展佈，希望它能在各地迅速成立，以適應蔣委員長所親自主持的全國節的建國儲蓄運動底偉大的展開。</p>
<p>烚赤專做期貨否</p>
<p>十八日本報載一新聞大意說烚赤的買賣以現貨爲限，雖亦有買空賣空，而均以實貨作爲準備。近因本埠游資充斥，富有者及一般商人無不購金儲藏，更有人暗中巨額搜買，致籌碼枯竭，同業無法收解，市塲當局將加改革擬專做期貨，到期以結價方法交割云。</p>
<p>上海標金市塲自戰後停止，一般經紀人乃另組烚赤賣買市塲在某銀號內，過去烚赤市價每以外匯爲進退，故自外匯暗市波濤迭起之後，烚赤市價亦屢見高價，最高見七千二百之紀錄。惟其間因爲英國在歐戰中，鎊價挫落，雖經統制外滙，而紐約市塲自由鎊價，輒難穩定，因之烚赤的起伏，乃轉以美滙的起伏爲歸依。</p>
<p>但是本週來大體上雖然仍跟美匯而走，但是因爲軋空關係，烚赤的變動已經不受美滙的拘束，它漲跌的程度，已不與美滙相吻合。如本週外匯美金收盤自五·七八一二五長至五·八四三七五，而烚赤則自五千六百五十八元漲至五千八百三十元。</p>
<p>查此决軋空所以發生者，則以遠東局勢危險日甚，外匯放長，一般保存美滙者以爲美日一旦在太平洋上發生戰事，美金勢必跌價，故以藏金爲保財的妙法，但讀一讀四行聯合辦事總處所發表的文吿；「或謂購藏條金，究屬實貨，最爲可靠，殊不知黃金早已收歸國有，上海環境特殊，政府法令一時不及，乃有黃金黑市產生，價値飛昂，…他日抗戰完成，政府縱不予沒收，而以法定價格收集之，購藏者損失已屬不貲，」故今日的上海購金者，如以藏金是保財的妙法，眞正大誤特誤了。</p>

<h3>維護南太平洋現狀　美國具援華決心　撤退僑民卽位事實證明　美步因日溫和而受蒙蔽　在歐洲方面則極援助英國</h3>
<p>本埠美籍觀察家某君、昨對訪者縱談國際局勢、據謂美國現行政策、在歐洲爲積極援助英國、在亞洲則積極援助中國、羅斯福總統最近曾發表演說稱、美國已決定繼續對英之援助、因該國之央勇戰爭、使侵略者不能近美國海岸、誠以英國此决對德作戰、不僅爲衛護英國之本身利益已也、</p>

<h3>融五社講經　論儒釋之持戒　佛教經論所說爲四項</h3>
<p>上星期融五講經社二次講經、來賓有上次所未到者、講經者楊中一·姚太平。二君、沈達齡君已預備五敎皆同之購題、因時間已晚、未及講、楊君講詞、錄要於下、</p>
<p>儒釋相同之點六、波羅密之一、復次曰尸羅波羅密、尸羅、華言持戒、謂能受持戒律而無破壊、卽是遵守規律、不染嗜好之自治心、或曰佛家有戒、儒家亦有戒乎、余曰有、見於論語君子三戒及元史廉希憲傳、「臣已受孔子戒」是也、歸納佛敎經論所說、的爲四項、</p>
<p>所受之品</p>
<p>大方便佛報恩經云、「戒有上中下、五戒是下品、十戒是中品、具戒是上品」、五戒者、不殺、不盜、不淫、不妄語、不飲酒、君子遠庖廚、賽不殺之心也、非義不取、養不盜之心也、思無邪、養不淫之心也、人言爲信、養不妄語之心也、禹流儀狄、衛武作酒戒、養不飲酒之心也、十戒者於五戒之外、加不着華鬘好香塗身、謂裝飾奢侈之服、戒之者不敢冶容也、不歌舞倡伎、亦不往觀聽、謂挾邪荒亡之行、戒之者不敢冶遊也、不得坐高廣大牀上、謂簡慢懈惰之態戒之者不敢晏安也、不得非時食、所以節口腹之欲、不得捉踐金銀寳物、所以惜財物之用、士志於道、而恥惡衣惡食者、未足與議也、惡衣服孔子稱禹無間然、衣敝縕袍、孔子美由之不恥、鄉黨一篇、記聖人之衣食居遊頗詳、誠士之模範也、具足戒者、比丘二百五十戒、比丘尼五百戒、實三百四十八戒、八宗綱要云、「受具戒時、並得如是無邊等戒、量等虛空、境徧法界、莫不圓足、故名具足戒、」具戒何以多至五百、曰五戒不爲少、五百戒不爲多、一言而可以終身行之者其恕乎、恕字、終身行之而不盡不爲少矣、禮儀三百、威儀三千、不厭其繁也、</p>
<p>所得之果</p>
<p>佛教恩經又云、「五戒中又分三、如若微品心受戒、得微品戒、若中品心受戒、得中品戒、若上品心受戒、得上品戒、十戒具戒、亦各三品、如五戒說、上品心得五戒、是上品戒、中品心得十戒、是中品戒、下品心得具戒、是下品戒、以是義故、隨心有上中下、得戒不同、無定限也、」受戒於形、不若受戒於心、受戒於形、可睹可聞、受戒於心、視於無形、聽於無聲、中庸曰、戒愼乎其所不睹、恐懼乎其所不聞、」大學曰、「十目所視、十手所指、」「是故君子必愼其獨、」學庸之愼、其卽受戒於心者乎、</p>
<p>智度論云、「下持戒生人間、中持戒生六欲天、持戒又行四禪、四空定、生色無色界、上持界有三種、下淸淨持戒得阿羅漢、中淸淨持戒得辟支佛、上淸淨持戒得佛道、」案下持仍投人間、還復得人身、差幸不致墮落於三途耳、中持戒生六欲天者、所謂脫離人間、上昇於天堂矣、欲界有六重天、（一）四犬王天、（二）切利天、（三）夜摩天、（四）兜率天、（五）樂變化天、（六）他化自在天、是六天者、忉利以下名地居天、兜率以上名空居天、若持戒又行四禪定、則脫離欲界而生色界天、又行叫空定、則史超出色界、而生無色界天、內分四層、一曰空無邊處定、二曰識無邊處定、三曰無所有處定、四曰非想非非想處定、中持戒者、能超出人問、而不能超出三界、故其究在於上持戒、而下淸淨持戒之上持戒者、得第四阿羅漢果、中淸淨持戒之上持戒、得辟支迦羅、卽緣覺是也、必待上淸淨持戒之持戒者、方得究竟最上一乘、佛上菩薩道、此皆以所受之品不、同而所得之果如是也、</p>
<p>論語記顏淵·仲·司馬牛·樊遲·問仁而孔子所吿之語不同、又記孟懿子，孟武伯·子游·子夏·問孝、而孔子所吿之語不同、子貢問士、孔子旣吿之以行己有恥、使不辱命矣、父問其次、則曰、宗族稱孝焉、鄉黨稱弟焉、又問其次、則曰言必信、行必果、經硜然小人哉、抑亦可以爲次矣、何者、此所受之品不同、所得之果故有勝劣也、是故孟子之論樂正子定中四之下、曰可欲之謂善、有諸己之謂信、充實之謂美、充實而有光輝之謂大、大而化之之謂聖、聖而不可知之之謂神、同一聖也、而伯夷聖之淸者也、伊尹聖之仟者也、柳下惠聖之和者也、孔子聖之時者也、</p>
<p>所持之律</p>
<p>梵綱經心地品云、「佛吿諸佛子言、有十重波羅提木又若受菩薩戒不誦此戒者、非菩薩、非佛種子、」木又華言解脫、謂處處解脫、或隨順解脫、七衆所受之戒律、解脫身口七支之罹惡、七支者、卽身三口四七支　業也、又云、佛吿佛子若自殺、敎人殺、方便殺、讀歎殺、忽作隨喜殺乃至咒殺、殺因殺緣、殺法、殺業、乃至一切有命者、不得故殺、」其餘如盜·淫·妄言·綺語。惡口·兩舌。皆同此十重、故以十重波羅提木又名、又云、「菩薩應起慈悲心救護、而恣意殺者、是波羅夷罪波羅夷斷頭之誼、謂無司懺悔也然則菩薩慈悲、乃在救護善人、不能庇袒惡人也、破戒作惡、至於無可懺悔、菩薩亦不能强爲姑息、此所以獲罪於天、無所禱也、獲罪而至無所禱、聖人亦末如之何、惟有哀矜而勿喜爾、</p>
<p>所戒之目</p>
<p>佛說四十二章經云、「佛言衆生以十事爲善、亦以十事爲惡、何等爲十、身三·口四·意三。身三者、殺·盜·淫、口四者兩舌·惡口·妄言·綺語、意三者、嫉·恚·痴、如是十事、不順聖道、名十惡行、是惡若止、各十善行、」如來設敎、無非欲人心惡行善、持此身口意三業之戒身、</p>
<p>身者庸德之行也、口者庸言之謹也、意者內省不疚也、言行君子之樞機、大戴禮曰、言不遠、」身言之主也、行不遠身、行之本也、故德行言語聖門四科、崇於政事、文學之上、此重尙言行之有足徵者、</p>
<p>姚君講孝經生民之本盡、死生之義備一句、發揮盡致、聽者動容、卽由死生之義講釗五敎之皆同、</p>
<h3>中央信託局舉辦　門市存貨兵險　每一商店總額以五千元爲限　各商店每日營業報吿存貨</h3>

<h3>各銀行努力　遊資內移　確數無可稽攷　但成績已車著</h3>
<p>上海游資流入內地、究有幾何、雖無確切數字可考、但據佔計、上海銀行界及其顧客、往渝及其他內地各處投資之總額、不下十五萬萬元之額、今年上半年又有十萬萬元流入內地、內中大部爲私營商號及個人滙軟、以發展企業者、此點允令人有深刻之印象、上海游資內流、爲一般人所贊同、因一方可使資金獲有正當用途、得開發西南之功效、一方可使上海投機風潮趨於减少、上海投機份子常在市塲興風作浪、每以滙兌市塲及重要商店、爲其投機之目標、而遺害於社會匪淺、上海資金之內移、係由中中交農四行、聯合各商業銀行共同努力所致、將來政府獎勵資金內移成功、戰時財政及經濟建設、自更益趨樂觀、</p>

<p>西捕之勝</p>
<p>西捕之中綫、昨日奇佳、使葡人望而却步、是爲獲勝要因之一、目得前聖芳濟名將史登茄、及短跑名將芳雪加之助、威風凜凜、使葡商爲之低首、而最後在三比五、被葡商追成四比五、相差僅一球時、葡商攻勢之猛、無以復加、惜乎終於功虧簣也、</p>

<p>西捕除史登茄與芳雪加兩雄外、其餘咸屬一班老人馬、門將勃爾賓、去屆之乙組人物也、但身手亦自不凡、昨晨兩陣旣圓以後、警員卽取包抄攻勢、向葡商陣地突襲、葡商俱爲一班老將、但前綫缺少兩羅柴遼昆仲、中衛少一雪而佛、動作便受陣碍、加以久疎弓馬、一旦臨塲、一轉瞬間、葡商內室、已被三道頭鮑台搜查一次、沒收一城、曾幾何時、新蒙虎皮之聖芳濟舊人史登茄、演出「帽子戲法」、三元連中葡商失風四次、軍心動盪、四座亦爲之愕然、相隔多時、葡商終在艱苦反抗中、由左內鋒蓋恩擊中勃爾賓一彈、上半時遂以四比一結束、</p>

<h3>解職。偷竊。懸賞緝捕之類  昱火</h3>
<p>昨天，一個習見的故鄕的同學，一淸早就奔到我的地方來，臉上顯現着稀有的驚惶。我急忙問他是着了什麽亂子。</p>
<p>「我也失業了！」這是他的一個悽厲的聲音。</p>
<p>我愕然感到迷離。因爲就我所知，他不僅僅是一個謹愼可愛的靑年，而且在他所服務的那爿襪廠裏，更是個勤學守正的店員，一向是很得他經理的信任的；這番的驟吿失業，寗不叫人奇怪！</p>
<p>根據他的吿訴，才知道被認爲不規而致解職的原因，經理說他「不專誠於業務！」而這所謂「不專誠」的事實，就是因爲我的同學乘了在外交遊之便，附做了些職務以外的生意，——關於零碎衣料的販售。不幸而有一次一個朋友跑到他的店中，大聲地來接洽那一椿的交易，致被經理發覺。晚上就被叫到經理窒去，迫詢之下，我的同學忠實地承認了，於是經理先生馬上發表了他的命令</p>
<p>「哦，那末就請另行高就吧！……」</p>
<p>他感到哭笑無從，昨天不得不反肩舖蓋離開店門，雖然只有一個人的負擔，但職業在今天畢竟還是他的生活的源泉，因此他苦喪着臉，要我替他找一處噉飯的地方。</p>
<p>我怪感覺到惶悚無已！雖然瞧着他那身歷的遭遇，不禁爲之一揮同情之淚，但由於自己的人微言輕，徒具有心而無從着力之慨。</p>
<p>但由於同學的被驟然解職，不覺又使我記起幾天前，本報本市新聞欄上所載先施公司四個職昌因犯偷竊而致被捕伏法的一件事來；同時從廣吿欄上不時可以發見的「縣賞緝捕逃夥×××」的廣吿，像這些案件的發生，和我的同學遭遇到的情形，雖屬二個樣子的，但貫穿於這一個時期中間的工商職工們左右的生活上的苦難，或多或少地有着他的共通之點的。</p>
<p>自從孤市物價的漲潮，愈趨愈烈以來，萬千的工商職工，處於米珠薪桂的狀態下，大多數臨着了他們飢寒困迫的死亡綫，在「求生」的願望下，誰不企圖從已有的低薪職務以外，找尋別的有利的「出路」呢？因此像我的同學的附置副業，實在不是件意外的妄圖，而且對業務並沒有仟大的影響，因爲他多方面的活動，完全是在業餘之暇，何能算作是「不專誠於業務」的罪疚呢？同時有些在「求路」無法，欲生又無能的情狀下，意志薄弱的，就釀出了自殺的慘劇；有着生的强烈的意望外，則不是假公濟私，便是作出種種竊偷，侵蝕公款財物的卑劣的仃爲來了，我們能說這是個人的罪惡，無恥的敗類嗎？（當然一些因迷戀於歌榭舞臺而致竊偷以資彌補的人也不是沒有，但不是最多數。）</p>
<p>這是產自社會的病源。只要不是忽視於現實的人，誰也都能洞悉今天孤市四周的魔鬼，（包括囤積，居奇的投機商人）所加予全市人民的死亡的威脅，造成了無盡數的苦痛與罪惡！</p>
<p>在這個大時代裏，我始終認爲上層與下層，鄰人和親人的打成一片的重要性，相互間的和洽無間，才能勿爲時代的惡魔所乘，而謀保共同的安全，渡過這艱危的階段。從我的同學的失業，和一些「懸賞緝捕」，「呑毒自殺」等的社會新聞中，我允其希望工商界的當局者們，能多多爲職工們的生活處境體諒和幫助，直接解除同仁們的苦痛；間接却也就是爲社會减少罪惡的發生。</p>
<h3>「登革熱」考  柯德瓊</h3>
<p>「登革」Dengue爲本症國際通用名稱，登革二字，並非人名，乃西班牙語裝飾之意，當指滿佈全身之紅疹而言。英國又名Dendy　Fever，意卽「花花公子熱」，殆以息者大都顏面紅潮，有類修飾富麗之紈袴子歟。，又稱折骨熱，蓋因肢骨奇痛，有如骨折者。我國舊名疳症，按　，痠痛也，亦以痠痛爲特徵而故名。</p>
<p>本症之流行，多在秋夏間，近河濱海低下之處，高原地甚罕，故與蚊類有密切關係。本症流行之速，傳播之廣，爲各種流行症之巨擘，傳染率之高，無出其右。一七七九年世界第一次發見於埃及和爪哇，一八七二年福建厦門，一九〇二年廣東汕頭潮州，均曾有劇烈之流行，居民患者達百分之八十。而此次流行，原發於松江一帶，七八月間，松人已十病其九，其時有認爲副傷寒，有認爲流行性感冒。近一月以來，滬上亦巳波及，且在迅速蔓延中。查上海人口過密，蚊類雖較內地爲少，但臭蟲遍處皆有，吃人血液，似亦可爲傳佈之媒介。若照歷屆傳染率估計，受害人數至少將達百萬人以上，誠屬駭人聽聞。所幸本症雖無特效治療，又乏預防之方，但經過順利，絕少危險，且流行期不長，至多不出兩月，故不久當見自歸消滅也。</p>

<h3>說到吃蟹  博文彥</h3>
<p>「今年的蟹眞貴，又是小年！」已不止一次聽到這樣慨嘆了。</p>
<p>在有錢人，比蟹更貴的米也整千包的堆在倉庫里，幾塊錢一隻蟹在他們或許還覺得不够味呢。窮得擠在隊伍中買平糶米的，大槪也不會再有雅興到蟹灘前去吟什麽詩吧？這樣說來，「眞貴」與「小年」有什麽關係呢。</p>
<p>可是我已不止一次聽到這樣的慨嘆了。</p>
<p>是誰在慨嘆呢？</p>
<p>米珠薪桂似乎已經厭彎了腰，可是「口福之好」如應時應節的點綴品的蟹之類却還是有「嘗試」之心，於是感到太貴了；而且，又是小年！</p>
<p>僅僅是慨嘆，當然不免有點「饞涎欲滴」，望望米缸中的米之後，還是揀小的買幾隻罷。吃過了，才像放下了做人的責任；然而，或許仍然不甘心地補一句，「在往年，這樣的蟹一塊錢可買一串呢！」然後再計算這一頓大嚼總共化了幾塊錢，再以之折合可購米若干升。這時候不免又是慨嘆一番；這慨嘆是嘆自己沒有錢的悲哀。</p>
<p>這類人不在少數。吃蟹如此，其他何獨不然！</p>
<h3>霍桑探案　舞后的歸宿  程小靑著</h3>
<p>第九章　驚人消息</p>
<p>我瞧見他這種神氣，也不能不感到驚異。「什麽？說啊。你想起了什麽？」</p>
<p>老毛訥訥地說：「這——這雙皮鞋——是陸經理的，他穿舊了送給我的。」</p>
<p>我暗忖老毛的解釋如果不虛，的確可以破除一個疑團，吾則那地版上的甲印，竟和陸健笙跟老毛的皮鞋都相同，未免太巧。我問道噢，這皮鞋是陸經埋送給你的嗎？什麽時候送你的？」</p>
<p>老毛想了一想，答道：「那還是去年年底——先生，你不必疑心，這不會假。這皮鞋不是陸經理直接給我的，是王小姐給我的。伊給我時，金梅也瞧見的，你可以問伊。——先生，我想——」他又停頓了不說。</p>
<p>我催着說：「你怎麽不說？想什麽」？</p>
<p>老毛舔着他的嘴脣，答道：「我想地板上的脚印旣然和這雙皮鞋的尺寸相同，也許昨夜陸經理進去過的。」</p>
<p>我低頭想了一想，並不回答，再問道：「昨夜裏你的確不曾進去過嗎？」</p>
<p>老毛直瞧着我的臉，理直氣壯地說道：「的確不會。我的話沒有半句假，我可以發誓的。」</p>
<p>我覺得他的話富眞不像虛假，一時又想不出其他足以證明的問句，便點點頭說：「好，現在金梅可在裏面？我要跟伊談談」。</p>
<p>老毛應道：「伊在樓上，我去叫伊」。他就回身走出門房去，在階級上又站住了，旋轉頭來，「叫伊到這裏來嗎？」</p>
<p>我搖頭道：「到會客室裏去。」</p>
<p>老毛走下了那水泥的階級，便穿出了冬靑的短籬，沿着那條早已乾透的水泥徑向正屋裹進去。我還在門房裏站了一站，向這小小的斗室察看了一下。除了一隻木架子的板舖，一隻小方桌和兩隻西式的直背椅子以外，牀底下還有一隻柳條的箱子　（一四二）</p>

<h3>安迪生傳略</h3>
<p>美國的幽默生（Raiph　Waldo　Emerson）曾經說過：「文化進步的眞正衡量方法，不在乎戶口的調查，也不在乎城市的大小，也不是田中的收穫，而在於國家所產生的人才」，這話是不錯的，所以對於安迪生的一切，正是每一個美國人所認爲自豪的。</p>
<p>安迪生可以代表一個典型的美國人，他有幽默感，他愛他的家庭，他有耐心和勇氣，他又仁慈而近乎人情。他根本和街上任何入差不多，他始終爲人着想而很少顧到他自已，因此美國的惠爾羅吉斯（Will　Rogers）說，卽使安迪生一件東西也沒有發明，他還是偉大的。</p>
<p>好萊塢米高梅影片公司，爲紀念安迪生發明電影五十周年，特地把他的一生，拍成二部影片幼年安迪生」和「偉大安迪生」。</p>
<p>十月二十一日是他發明電燈泡的紀念日，本報特輯是刋，表示對他十二分的景仰，同時並將本報主辦預定昨日發表的小學生暑期作業競賽得獎名單，改在今日本刊揭曉，希望小朋友們效法他，模仿他，將來和他一樣的偉大，則本刊之輯，更有意義了。　—編者誌</p>
<p>安迪生是一八四七年二月十一日在美國渥海歐州米蘭鎭誕生的，他的祖先是荷蘭人，他的祖父是一個保皇黨所以在革命以後，就被放逐到埃拿大去，而他的父親是一個革命家，所以又從坎拿大移居到美國，他的母親是一個女敎師，原籍蘇格蘭和奎格的合種。他的幼年時的家境並不好，但他勤於硏究的天性，在很早的時候就流露出來的。譬如看見鵝在蛋上伏着，日久小鵝孵化，他就去坐在鷄蛋上，希望孵出小鷄來。</p>
<p>他曾經到學校裏去讀書，但敎師以爲他是昏庸的，所以只上了三個月的學，就被送回家。在十一歲的時候，他就開始在家裏一間小屋子裹試騐各種化學，他有二十個大瓶，上面都貼着「有毒」的字樣，防止家人去玩弄，他又從鄉村裹的藥房中買了其他的化學品，自己配合。這種資產一點點的增多，到了十五歲時，已經有許多關於化學和物理的重要書籍</p>
<p>那時候，他的家搬到了泡脫河朗去，他在火車上買賣糖菓和報紙，有多餘的錢就添購化學用品，在行李室裏試騐，並且出版星期週報一種。但不幸得很，因爲有一天燐粉散去，卽時火起，立刻和車長用水撲滅，但楚車長的餘怒未熄，在火車停時，把他驅逐出去，同時因爲將他的耳朶重軍的敲了一下，使他成爲聾子。而印刷機化學品等，倒了滿地，使他大哭。</p>
<p>他把化學品和印刷機收到家裏，出版一張小報，評論本鎭的人物，激起了鎮人的衆怒，把他投到小河裹去，小報也就宜吿停版。</p>
<p>那時候，他很有讀書的志願，可是沒有機會上學，只得在空暇的時候，在藏書樓裏讀書，對於各種科學，就粗識門徑。</p>
<p>當他在火車上賣報的時候，因爲有一天站長的兒子遇難，幸虧他去救護，站長十分感激，所以敎他雷報，四個月後，他已經練習得很熟，於是加入鐵路服務。</p>
<p>一八六八年，他到巴士頓去，加入西聯電報公司，他在那裏是發報最快的一個。同時在那裹，發明了選舉記錄機，那時候他還只二十一歲。一八六九年他到紐約，在一八七〇年做成了股票記錄機，得到了四禹元的代價。在一八七三年上與瑪利·司蒂惠爾女士結婚</p>
<p>他利用那一筆收入，建造一個試騐室，後來在一八七六年遷到門羅公園鎭去。</p>
<p>在許多同志共同努力下，經過多次的失敗，屢次幾乎破二五五號。</p>
<p>一八八四年瑪利·司蒂惠爾女士逝世，在一八八六年續娶妮娜·密勒女士，到一九三一年十月十八日，這位偉大的科學家與世長辭，但他給予人們的幸福，將永遠受到人類的歌頌。</p>
<p>安迪生一生的事蹟，足資靑年效法的地方很多，第一是他刻苦的精神，當他發明電燈產，到一八七九年十月一十一日發明了電燈泡，這是他一生最大的發明，其他經他發明而專利的東西，共有一千一百五十多種。</p>
<p>在一八七九年十二月二十一日紐約導報登了全頁的新聞詳細記　他發明的燈泡，並在當年的聖誕節公開試騐，參觀的人數，共有三千多人。</p>
<p>在一八八年，他創設一個發電廠，成立於紐約珍珠街泡的時候，即使是燈絲一項，他曾經試騐了九千次，方始成功。</p>
<p>他往往工作日以夜繼，沒有充分的休息時間，而當他初到紐約的時候，實在沒有錢去租房子住，所以就在工塲上休息四個鐘點，因爲他每天工作十六小時，所以他的生命，實在比別人要長一倍。他曾經說過時間是世界上最寶貴的東西，因爲牠不是金錢所能購買的。</p>
<p>他一生努力發明，但他所發明的東西，都是人類所需要的，凡是人類不需要的東西，他就不願發明。</p>
<p>他努力工作，對於衣着毫不在意，他把所有的錢都化在書籍和用具上面，他從不走進酒店去消磨他的時間。</p>
<p>他有隨時做摘記的習慣，他所有的書籍上面註滿了許多註解。書籍是他最好的伴侶，有一次他發明一種東西，會經硏究了六個星期，就在工作的地方吃飯睡覺，而做了二千次的試騐，方始成功。</p>
<h3>電燈泡進化述要</h3>
<p>·安迪生發明電燈泡</p>
<p>·柯立奇博士發明鎢絲眞空泡</p>
<p>·蘭格米博士發明氬氣泡</p>
<p>·彼金氏發明裹面磨砂泡</p>
<p>·現代最新式的絞絲泡</p>
<p>世界上對於發明電燈泡曾經努力的人有好幾個，在安迪生發明之前，有幾個英國人也曾經有同等的企圖，但是他們都沒有成功。</p>
<p>安迪生在紐約裝成了股票紀錄機後，得到了四萬元的酬報，他就利用這一筆錢，建起了一座試騐室，在許多同志的共同努力下，發明了許多東西</p>
<p>當時所用的弧光燈，他以爲有改造的必耍，所以他一心要發明電燈。他想用電流去使某種物體受熱，而不致於燒斷，因爲熱和光是不能分離的，熱度愈高，發光也愈大。根據許多書籍上的記載，他決定先用炭精來試騐，但牠雖則可以在空氣裏燃燒，終究是要燒完的，所以一定耍把空氣除去。</p>
<p>他就用紙條，放在玻璃瓶裹，結果燒了八分鐘便熄滅了，炭精似乎並不可靠，但經他一度用其他金屬質如白余等合金試騐之後，還是仍舊用炭精，不過電流通過以後，往往要把炭精溶化，而他的抽氣機並不高妙，所以做成的燈泡，至多祗燃點十五分鐘。</p>
<p>在一八七九年，他得到了一架完美的抽氣機，可以將全部的空氣抽去，於是又用炭精來試騐。他當時先用普通的棉綫做成一個像髮又一樣彎形的東西，然後把牠放到爐子裏燃燒，再鑲在鎳質的模型裏而放到玻璃泡裏去，就在一八七九年十月二十一日的晚上，成功了第一隻燈泡，繼續的燃燒了四十小時。</p>
<p>安迪生會經說過：我們坐着看道隻電燈繼續燃燒着，燒得愈長久，我們更驚奇而快樂。</p>
<p>不過那時候所做成的燈泡，還不能合乎理想，所以歷次改良，因爲第一隻電燈泡是在安迪生手中創造出來的所以安迪生是現代燈泡的鼻祖。</p>
<p>在他第一次發明以後，他和各國工程師，歷加改良，一九〇五年，德國威爾白博士（Dr．Aner　Von　Wklsb</p>

<h3>安迪生所辦的星期週報</h3>
<p>當安迪生到火車上去做報紙和糖菓的販賣員後，他除了把一部份所賺得的錢，寄回到家裏去外，就陸續　在行李室裏添置他的產業。有一次他買了一架手搖的印刷機就出版一種星期週報Weekly　Herald，利用他所學得的電報的經騐，同時向各分站的電報室中探聽消息，所以他所登載的新聞，完全是最新的。</p>
<p>安迪生辦報的時候，雖則只有十五歲，但對於經營的方法，是很足驚人的。他懂得新聞學的眞諦，他也懂得報紙的正當經營的方法。</p>
<p>在那張週報中，有下列一段啟事：</p>
<p>「Grand　Trunk各地經理人鑒：請把定報單交給第屈勞綜合車站賣報童T.安迪生，我們將十分感激，請附入報費每月八分，絕對先付。」</p>
<p>在那週報中，分為幾欄，「欄有一欄的特色，在「希望」一欄之中，曾經登載過下列一段：據最近公佈的法律，限制所有泡脫河朗的酒館開到本星期日為止，這一種舉動，確是很需要的，因為這種酒館，實在使人可厭。</p>
<p>從他所主編，採訪，出版，發行的報紙裏面，還可以看出他對於詩詞方面的天才，因為他時常發表幾首詩。</p>
<p>雖則他的報紙的篇幅並不大，但是內容方面，可說是包羅萬象的。對於國際新聞，也受到他相當的重視，所以在某一期裏，就有一段新聞說：據巴黎消息，中國皇帝，將派特任大使，常駐英法兩國。</p>
<p>「物價」一欄，也可以說是週報的特色之一，從這一欄裏告訴我們當時的物價是：</p>
<p>雞蛋　每打一角二分。</p>
<p>雞　每隻一角到二角。</p>
<p>火雞　每隻五角到六角。</p>
<p>鴨　每對三角。</p>
<h3>安迪生所發明的東西</h3>
<p>安迪生所發明的東西，多得不可勝數，在這裏所舉的是幾種比較重要的。</p>
<p>選舉紀錄機：這是他第一次專利的發明品，但當時曾遭到當局的拒絕應用。</p>
<p>電話傳導器：亞歷山大倍爾對於電話的發明，決不會成功，如果沒有安迪生發明炭精傳導器。</p>
<p>股票紀錄機：他從這一件發明品，得到了四萬元的酬報他不信任銀行，所以把現款帶到工塲去。</p>
<p>電報重復收發機：從這次發明，在同一發報機上可以同時發出四個電報，他得到了三萬元的凈利，但要想發明更複雜的收發機，結果是失敗的。</p>
<p>美奇風：這種發明可以使人的聲音傳到一哩之外去，其實就是長途電話的前身。</p>
<p>電影：他所發明的就是着名的Kinetoscope。</p>
<p>留聲機：許多發明家都以為這是最簡單的發明。</p>
<p>電燈：這是安迪生最重要的發明，在成功之前，不知失多了敗少次。</p>
<p>開鑛機：在在紐求賽州安迪生城，有許多對於開鑛工程的發明。</p>

<p>此後又經過幾個進步的步驟：一九二九年蘭格米博士（Dr.　Irving　Langmuir）發明氮氣泡，再改進而成為氬氣泡（俗稱哈夫泡）</p>
<p>一九二四年米給蘭和惠脫二人（Louis　E.　Mitchell,　ArthurJ.　White）又發明把燈泡上的尖端除去，不久，奇異電器公司工程師彼金氏（Mr.　Marvin　Pipkin）發明一種裏面磨砂燈泡。</p>
<p>電燈的改良，是沒有窮盡的，最新的是絞繞光，把燈泡絲雙重絞繞，在二生的米突的地位裏要絞繞三千二百次，發光更亮，上海奇異安迪生廠，根據美國總廠的種種新發明，製造奇異安迪生燈泡，用同等電量，發光可以較安迪生所發明的燈泡強大十倍，該廠還在不斷繼續努力，竭求改進，還有一件有趣味的事情，就是該廠廠長金氏（Mr.　J.　S.　King）還是安迪生當時工作的同事。就是擔任奇異安迪生燈炮發行的中和燈泡公司總經理毛克儉（Mr.　J.　Mokerjs）和上海營業部主任傅耀誠君等曾在美國奇異電器公司服務過很多時候。</p>

        <h1>1940.10.21</h1>
<h3>U.S. Establishes New Naval Policy: Preparing to Deal with Incidents Alone; Maintaining the Status Quo in the Far East with Full Strength; U.S.-Canada Understanding and Cooperation to be Expanded</h3>
<p>Washington, D.C. It seems that the United States has made a decision today to achieve naval leadership in both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans in order to protect the Western Hemisphere and the interests of major powers in the Pacific. The Navy Department is establishing a new naval policy based on the "Two-Ocean Navy Act" passed by Congress and the lease of British air and naval bases in Newfoundland. It is reported that the purpose of this new policy is to maintain sufficient naval strength so that it "can conduct large-scale battles in both oceans simultaneously." Military strategists with access to naval information here believe that this policy is sufficient to deal with the current chaotic new world situation. These experts say that the United States traditionally relied on cooperation with the British Navy to protect its Monroe Doctrine and maintain the "status quo" in the Far East. However, today, Britain's strength has been constrained by the European war and is no longer reliable. Therefore, the United States must prepare to deal with incidents alone. According to their opinion, the policy of the U.S. Army and Navy Department is based on the following three possibilities: (1) Britain may be able to defeat the German attacks and continue to maintain the naval balance of power in the world. If this can become a reality, then the combined naval strength of Britain and the United States will be sufficient to remove the threat of omnipotent countries. (2) If the British Isles are conquered by Germany, the British fleet will inevitably flee to Canada and Australia and cooperate with the U.S. Navy. If so, the U.S. Navy will be the main force in protecting the English-speaking peoples from being conquered by Germany. (3) If the British fleet is seized or destroyed by Germany, the United States must take Britain's place and replace it, striving to build the largest navy and be the "lord of the sea." It is said that, according to the new naval program, the United States has the strength to deal with any naval threat from Japan or from the combined forces of Germany and Italy. Military leaders generally believe that the first or second option is likely to be realized, because they have repeatedly received assurances from British Prime Minister Churchill that the British fleet will never surrender or scuttle itself. However, they admit that, in fact, Britain is constrained by the European war and can no longer take any action in the Far East. Therefore, the United States must shoulder the responsibility of maintaining the "status quo" in the East alone. These military leaders are very clear about Japan's "ambitions in Greater East Asia." Therefore, they believe that if the United States wants to protect the Philippines, which will become independent in 1946, and other U.S. interests in the Pacific, the United States must have a reliable naval guarantee so that it can speak with authority. They also feel that once Japan controls the Dutch East Indies and other parts of the Far East, the position of the Hawaiian Islands will no longer be as important as it is today. The new naval policy states the following principle for U.S. naval policy toward U.S. overseas territories: "Maintain naval strength and be ready at all times to maintain national policy and domestic and foreign interests." The new policy will also be fully developed to establish three major bases, two on the American continent and one in Hawaii. (United Press dispatch from the 20th)</p>
<p>Quebec. Canadian Governor-General Earl of Athlone and his wife, along with their daughter, arrived yesterday at President Roosevelt's villa in Hyde Park, New York. The Earl and Countess will be hosted by the U.S. President there later this week. (Reuters dispatch from the 20th)</p>
<p>Hyde Park, New York. The Canadian Governor-General arrived at President Roosevelt's home here yesterday and subsequently held talks with President Roosevelt. It is believed that the talks between the Canadian Governor-General and President Roosevelt this weekend will expand the current understanding and cooperation between the United States and Canada. (United Press dispatch from the 20th)</p>
<h3>U.S. to Close Consulates in Various Parts of Japan; Evacuation Ships to Sail to the Far East Immediately; American Women and Children to Arrive in Shanghai Within the Month</h3>
<p>Tokyo. According to sources here, the U.S. Consulate in Nagoya, Japan, will be closed because there are no more American expatriates in the city. It is said that the same situation has occurred in other cities in Japan, and U.S. consulates will also be closed. "Nichinichi Shimbun" reported that the U.S. Consulate General in Tokyo will be closed. (Haitong News Agency dispatch from the 20th)</p>
<p>Washington, D.C. The State Department announced last night that the Matson Navigation Company's ships "Mariposa" and "Monterey" will soon sail to the Far East to evacuate American expatriates from the East. The "Monterey" sailed from Los Angeles on October 16 and is expected to reach Yokohama on the 29th and Shanghai on November 1. According to the State Department, the "Monterey" can carry 423 American expatriates at each Far Eastern port. The "Mariposa" will sail from Honolulu on October 30.</p>
<h3>Pro-German Slogans Found at U.S. Recruitment Office</h3>
<p>New York. U.S. Army authorities recently found Axis propaganda slogans at an army recruiting office a few days ago, which they believe to be the work of pranksters. Papers printed with Nazi swastikas were posted all over the walls of the office, and other places were plastered with slogans such as "Heil Hitler," "Long Live the Nazis," and "Long Live the Fascists." Also, many people in New York recently received various types of small coins in the mail, all engraved with swastikas. (United Press dispatch from the 20th)</p>
<p>Washington, D.C. The State Department declined to comment on reports that German Consul in New York, Trangue, was directing Nazi activities in the United States. (United Press dispatch from the 20th)</p>
<p>It will arrive in Shanghai on November 9. It is said that the ship can carry 1,100 passengers. In addition, the "Monterey" will also go to Qinhuangdao to pick up American expatriates there, and then return to the United States via Kobe. (United Press dispatch from the 20th)</p>
<p>New York. The U.S. Lines' ship "Washington," after urgently installing 2,000 hammocks, sailed to the Far East yesterday afternoon to accelerate the emergency evacuation of American expatriates. The ship carried 135 officers and soldiers of the Second Marine Division to serve in the Panama Canal. This is the first batch of naval reservists to be called up for service. The "Washington" will also transport a large quantity of military supplies in San Pedro to supply the U.S. Army and Navy in the Far East. The person in charge of the "Washington's" speedy voyage to the Far East is shipowner Manning. After adding 2,000 hammocks to the ship, it can evacuate 3,100 American expatriates from the Far East. (United Press dispatch from the 2nd)</p>
<p>San Francisco. The President Taft mail ship, after being delayed by a two-day sailors' strike, departed yesterday for Honolulu and other Eastern countries in order to evacuate American expatriates from the Far East. (International News Service dispatch from the 20th)</p>
<p>Beijing. There are a total of 900 American expatriates in Beijing, including 350 women and children. In addition, there are 400 Marines, for a total of 1,300 people. Although the American expatriates in Beijing have received a notice from the State Department advising them to evacuate as soon as possible, their actions have not yet been fully determined and they seem to be taking a wait-and-see attitude. What is known is that most of the women and children will go to Shanghai first this month in order to wait for ships to return home. (Havas dispatch from the 19th)</p>
<h3>Britain Intensifies Blockade Against Japan in the Far East; Buys Up All Aircraft Fuel in the Dutch East Indies; Netherlands Denies Agreement with Japan</h3>
<p>London. The British government announced today that a new competition for economic footholds in the Far East has begun, and stated that the British Empire has bought up all the aircraft gasoline produced in the East Indies. Just as Japanese bombers are attempting to cut off the Burma Road and Japanese envoys are trying to buy oil in the East Indies, the British side revealed that all high-grade gasoline in the East Indies has now been "branded" and is ready to be shipped to Britain. At the same time, London officials expressed skepticism about the reports in Tokyo newspapers that the Batavia-Japan-Netherlands negotiations had reached a consensus, but stated that the export of low-grade gasoline and oil from the East Indies to Japan would not be prevented. It is generally known that the Japanese had requested the East Indies to sell them 14,000,000 barrels of gasoline and kerosene annually, but the British side stated that it was "very remote" that this request would be agreed to. It is said that London is "closely watching" the Batavia negotiations, but the general impression is that "the United States has more to do with this matter than Britain." From the information obtained here, the general impression is that unless Japan uses force, the blockade of high-grade aircraft gasoline in the East Indies is already in effect. (International News Service dispatch from the 20th)</p>
<p>New York. Washington officials are very interested in Britain's purchase of all aircraft gasoline stocks in the Dutch East Indies. It is emphasized here that this new measure by Britain will have a significant impact on Japan, because since the United States implemented a fuel embargo, it has forced Japan to seek gasoline from "elsewhere." According to reports from Batavia, oil rights negotiations between Japan and the Dutch East Indies are also at an impasse. (Haitong News Agency dispatch from the 20th)</p>
<p>Washington, D.C. The Dutch delegation here stated yesterday that, to their knowledge, the talks currently being held between Japan and the Dutch East Indies authorities in Batavia are only to find ways to ensure that the Dutch East Indies can continue to supply gasoline to Japan. They denied the rumors that Japan has reached an agreement with the Dutch East Indies, and that 40% of the gasoline needed by Japan in the next six months should be supplied by the Dutch East Indies. (United Press dispatch from the 10th)</p>
<h3>British Cabinet Member Greenwood Warns Japan: Rashly Participating in the War Will Lead to Unfortunate Consequences</h3>
<p>London. Greenwood, a cabinet member without portfolio, said in a speech in Wakefield last night that although Britain has scars on its face, its spirit remains unchanged and cannot be subdued. No one can predict at this time who will join the war and who will stay out of it before the war ends. I hope that Japan will not be so foolish as to participate in the war. However, neutral countries now know that Britain cannot be threatened, humiliated, or defeated, as they imagined a few months ago, and they know that Britain is now stronger than it was at the beginning of the war. We can now speak to Japan in a way that we considered dangerous four months ago. (Reuters dispatch from the 20th)</p>
<h3>Australian Prime Minister Calls Out: The War Crisis is Approaching</h3>
<p>Canberra. Australian Prime Minister Menzies said in a broadcast last night that if anyone believes that the war danger in Australia is not as serious as what Britain is currently experiencing, then that person is currently living in a fool's paradise, and this paradise will turn into a fool's hell in a few days. (Reuters dispatch from the 20th)</p>
<p>Melbourne. The Australian Minister for the Army announced that British recruitment matters in Australia will be carried out again early next year. (Reuters dispatch from the 20th)</p>
<p>The American People All Support Banning the Sale of Military Equipment to Japan</p>
<p>New York. There was an initiative to solicit public opinion on the question of "should the government ban the sale of arms, aircraft, gasoline, and other war goods to Japan." The results showed that 90% of the respondents supported the embargo. (Reuters dispatch from the 20th)</p>
<h3>U.S.-Soviet Talks Progress; Japan Feels Anxious; Kensuke Horiuchi Departs Washington to Return Home; Ishii Says Japan Will Avoid Conflict with U.S.</h3>
<p>Tokyo. Asahi Shimbun's comments on the U.S.-Soviet talks reflect Japan's anxiety, stating that the Soviet Union does not seem to fully support the alliance between Japan and the Axis powers. The Japanese people should pay close attention to future developments. The United States is now trying its best to bring the Soviet Union into the Anglo-American bloc. The United States' permission for the Soviet Union to charter ships to transport goods to Vladivostok and allow the export of machinery shows that there has been progress in U.S.-Soviet negotiations.

Horiuchi visited Secretary of State Hull yesterday for a brief farewell.

<p>San Francisco. Ishii, the new Japanese Ambassador to Chile, said here yesterday that war between the United States and Japan is impossible, because Japan joined the Axis alliance to avoid conflict. Ishii arrived here aboard the Asama Maru to take up his new post. Ishii said that Japan believes that if it joins the Axis powers, a war with the United States will be impossible. Therefore, Japan concluded this public agreement to avoid conflict. He further stated that there are still many ways for U.S.-Japan cooperation to be pursued, and sufficient time to seek and improve all current difficulties. He continued that Japanese Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka instructed him to make this statement upon arriving in the United States. Ishii declined to discuss rumors that Japan is negotiating a non-aggression pact. (United Press dispatch from the 10th)</p>
<h3>Roman Pope Broadcasts to the U.S., Urging Prayers for Peace</h3>
<p>Vatican City. Pope Pius XII broadcast to the American people yesterday on the eve of "Missionary Sunday," urging prayers for peace. The Pope said that "world peace is part of the Church's missionary goals," and denounced the war as hindering the work of the clergy. The Pope said, "Missionaries are heroes of Christ. They suffer and labor, fighting in danger, poverty, and destruction." He hoped that through the prayers of believers, "peace based on equal treatment and order among people and countries will be realized." The Pope also gave his blessing to the Catholics in the United States. (United Press dispatch from the 20th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The U.S.-Soviet Talks in Progress</h3>
<p>In recent days, the Soviet Union's TASS news agency has been authorized by the Soviet authorities to refute rumors almost every day. Upon investigation, half of the sources of these rumors are from democratic countries and Allied countries, and although there are also reports from neutral countries, they each originate from one side of the belligerent countries' positions. This is naturally due to the subtle attitude and complicated situation of the Soviet Union itself, but it also shows that in the recent international competition, the Soviet Union is the most pivotal and has become the main object of contention for both sides of the international power camp. Further investigation of the effect of these bizarre and diverse rumors reveals that they not only fail to influence the Soviet Union's external position, but also, under another consciousness, very likely increase the Soviet Union's restraint and prudence, and increasingly believe that it is wise to remain aloof from all international disputes.</p>
<p>Since the Tripartite Pact, this newspaper has repeatedly made detailed comments on the Soviet Union's attitude. Yesterday, it analyzed the British-German diplomacy towards the Soviet Union and asserted that in the future, the key to the development of the Balkan situation lies in the rise and fall of British-German diplomacy towards the Soviet Union. At the same time, parallel to this competition, there is a race between the U.S. and Japan for negotiations with the Soviet Union. And the safety of the Pacific situation in the future will undoubtedly depend on the future of this negotiation. Although the international division is now much clearer than before, the wars being waged on both sides of Asia and Europe are also trending closer. However, the Allied countries have implied that the pact will not create new constraints, and the Soviet Union may not fail to deal with individual Allied countries differently due to the different relationships between urgency and importance. If the situation in the Balkans and the Black Sea becomes tense again, then, considering the Soviet authorities' consistent view of the western border over the eastern border, it will have a significant impact on the negotiations being conducted by the U.S. and Japan with the Soviet Union at the same time: either temporarily approaching Japan for strategic reasons, so that the醞釀 of a Soviet-Japanese non-aggression pact gains unexpected success; or the fundamental contradictions will sharpen the confrontation with Japan, so that the international mixed and chaotic situation will not continue; these two trends are diametrically opposed, but today, to calmly discuss their possibilities, each occupies half and half. In recent days, American public opinion seems to have shown impatience and even resentment due to the U.S.-Soviet relationship remaining stagnant and unimproved: from this deduction, of course, changes cannot be foreseen. To say that the Soviet Union will inevitably be pro-Japanese and anti-American is certainly arbitrary and exaggerated; but to say that the situation of a U.S.-Soviet joint containment of Japan will inevitably be realized is also overly optimistic; in short, the future is unknown.</p>
<p>In terms of the recent international situation, the foreign policy of any country must not allow emotional likes and dislikes to be mixed with actual interests without distinguishing them; the one who knows this best and uses it most precisely is Germany, which is obviously beyond the reach of democratic countries. The Nazi Party's basic ambition to oppose communism and oppose the Soviet Union does not hinder its conclusion of a non-aggression pact with the Soviet Union; Japanese right-wing politicians and soldiers are now trying their best to follow suit. In democratic countries, however, the anti-communist instincts of the big capitalists often hinder the implementation of beneficial foreign policies, which is the most distressing phenomenon in recent years. As of today, it is necessary to urge them to thoroughly reflect on this. At this moment, the U.S. and Japan towards the Soviet Union are quite similar to the diplomatic competition between Britain, France and Germany towards the Soviet Union before August last year. At that time, the British-French-Soviet mutual assistance agreement failed to achieve anything for a long time, while the conclusion of the Soviet-German non-aggression pact had the appearance of water flowing to a ditch. The Soviet Union once incurred the aversion of international anti-aggression elements because of this, but in all fairness, this was not because the Soviet Union was biased between the two hostile camps of Britain, France and Germany, but because of the essential differences between the two proposals. The mutual assistance agreement is active, and the result is inevitably that obligations will be more than rights; the non-aggression agreement is passive and sufficient to ensure one's own safety for a period of time; if any country only considers its own temporary interests and does not consider others, there is no doubt that the non-aggression agreement is easier to accept than the mutual assistance agreement. At present, in the U.S. and Japanese negotiations with the Soviet Union, the U.S. government does not lack sincerity as the British authorities did at that time, and has given the Soviet Union considerable economic benefits, but what the U.S. demands from the Soviet Union is more advanced than Japan's mere request for mutual non-aggression (if the Japanese side's request goes beyond the scope of mutual non-aggression, it is expected that there will be absolutely no chance of success), then the ease or difficulty of negotiations between the two will inevitably affect the future of this triangular relationship. But this is also not that the Soviet Union's affinity for the U.S. and Japan is contrary to the world's ideas, but precisely the natural result of a "neutral and peaceful policy" and avoiding taking chestnuts out of the fire.</p>
<p>If the Soviet authorities' considerations are in line with the above speculation, then the Soviet Union's subjective "neutral peace" will inevitably lead to the consequences of aggression and disturbance in another area in an objective sense; because this guarantee of "non-aggression" is precisely a signal for those with great desires to reduce their worries and carry out aggression arbitrarily. Therefore, the world's hope that the Soviet authorities will be particularly cautious in handling matters is no different from expecting a certain part of the United States to correct its anti-Soviet instincts.</p>
<p>In our view, the so-called joint problem with Japan should only occupy a part of the U.S.-Soviet negotiations. What should be known is that the more important central task should be the closely coordinated joint aid to China. Because between the Soviet Union and the United States, only on the point of aid to China can absolute consistency be achieved, and the result of aid to China is directly beneficial to oneself on the one hand, and indirectly restrains Japan on the other. Even if the Soviet-Japanese non-aggression pact is truly established, as long as the Soviet Union does not change its consistent and firm declaration of aid to China, then the actual benefits that this empty paper agreement can give to Japan will ultimately be limited and cannot be compared with the effect of joint Soviet-American aid to China; and the restraining effect that the Soviet Union shares in the Pacific will also be exerted more effectively by China. This is what both sides must have realized in the current U.S.-Soviet talks.</p>
<h3>China Adopts Special Precautions to Maintain the Traffic of the Yunnan-Burma Road; Important Bridges are Equipped with Anti-Aircraft Guns; Road Repair Teams are Ready to Work at Any Time</h3>
<p>Chongqing. Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek has decided to maintain the traffic of the Burma Road at any cost, and has adopted special precautionary measures to eliminate the impact of Japanese air raids. Anti-aircraft guns have been installed, and a large number of road construction materials have been stockpiled at key points. Road repair teams are stationed along the way, ready to work at any time. Former Ambassador to the Soviet Union Chiang Ting-fu broadcast yesterday that the Burma Road will always exist. This is not only a physical link among democratic countries, but also a spiritual bond. Chinese military and transportation authorities recently told a Reuters visitor that the Japanese bombing of the Burma Road does not seem to hinder the passage of the road. Emergency construction materials have been prepared along the way, and important bridges are protected by anti-aircraft gun teams. (Reuters dispatch from the 20th)</p>
<p>New York. According to radio broadcasts obtained here, the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun declared today that Japan has the right to bomb the Burma Road in Burma. According to the broadcast by the Domei News Agency, since Britain has recognized that a state of war exists between China and Japan, its reopening of the Burma Road proves that Britain has made itself Japan's enemy. Therefore, Japan can have the same right to bomb the section of the highway in Burma as it does in China. (Taiwan Public News Agency dispatch from the 10th)</p>
<h3>Chinese Aircraft Shot Down Two Aircraft Northwest of Yichang</h3>

<h3>Military Commission Announces Weekly War Report: October 13th to 19th</h3>
<p>Chongqing: A spokesperson for the Military Commission stated that since this week (October 13th to 19th), the battles in the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui-Jiangxi area have been particularly fierce. Our troops, following pre-arranged plans, fiercely attacked the Japanese army, captured key positions, and achieved numerous victories. Other fronts have also had successive victories. The following is a summary of the combat operations:</p>
<p>Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Border Area: The Japanese troops in the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui area launched a large-scale offensive this week. The Japanese army invading western Zhejiang advanced along the northern and southern routes of Tianmu Mountain. The Japanese army that invaded Xiaofeng and Anji from Wukang in the north of the mountain was repelled by our forces. The Japanese troops who invaded Guangde from Si'an were also surrounded and severely attacked by our forces, suffering heavy casualties. The remaining Japanese troops retreated towards Langxi in southern Anhui and were intercepted by our forces along the way, resulting in many casualties. The Japanese troops south of the mountain repeatedly attacked Lin'an and Xindeng but were defeated by our forces. The county seat was lost and regained. The Japanese suffered heavy casualties and attempted to cross the Fuchun River to attack Zhuji. They were intercepted by our forces midway, suffering significant losses. Fierce fighting is still ongoing. The Japanese troops invading from Jurong and Jintan in southern Jiangsu attempted to join the Japanese forces invading Xiyang in western Zhejiang but were attacked by our forces. The Japanese suffered heavy losses. The important Japanese stronghold of Huangjin Town west of Jintan has been recaptured by our forces, who seized a large amount of spoils of war. The Japanese troops invading Yicheng from southern Anhui once entered the city but were surrounded and severely attacked by our forces, with nearly all of them annihilated. The remaining Japanese troops were defeated and retreated, and there are now no Japanese troops in the area. Another unit of our forces captured Yinjiahui and several nearby high grounds west of Guichi on the 15th, posing a significant threat to Japanese shipping on the Yangtze River.</p>
<p>Hubei-Jiangxi Area: Our forces in Hubei Province have launched continuous attacks in Qianjiang, Mianyang, Jingzhou, Shashi, and areas east of Dangyang and Yichang. Following the capture of Lijiafu, Yuquan Mountain, and Ganxi Township, they successively captured Huanglong Temple, Huiwang Mountain, Daxiaoguan Pass, Haozikou, and other strongholds.

Our forces in northern Jiangxi successively captured Wangjiaguan, Xiao'ao, Shuangsong Bridge, Guantou, and other strongholds along the Ruiwu Road, boosting morale. On the night of the 11th, they recaptured Madang, a key strategic point and the throat of the Yangtze River, effectively cutting off Japanese shipping on the Yangtze River. Subsequently, the Dajiao River and Henggang in the Ruiwu area were also successively recaptured. The Japanese troops who invaded Xin'gan have been repelled by our forces.</p>
<p>Guangdong-Guangxi Area: Our forces in eastern Guangdong continuously attacked Bijia Mountain, an important Japanese stronghold in Chao'an County, completely destroying the Japanese construction works and inflicting heavy casualties on the Japanese.

<p>Southern Shanxi Area: Our forces along the Tongpu Railway in southern Shanxi have continuously destroyed five Japanese tanks and over ten vehicles, killing hundreds of Japanese soldiers. The Japanese troops in Zhao'cheng who invaded Haoyi Village were surrounded and severely attacked by our forces, suffering heavy casualties. Our forces also launched frequent attacks on the Japanese troops in Nanmo, Nan Town, Moshang Village, and Fengqian Village south of Jiexian, achieving considerable victories. Japanese Lieutenant General Otsuka Takeo, who was severely wounded during our forces' mopping-up operation against the Japanese troops near Taiyuan last month, has died. The Japanese troops in Xinyang Liulin in southern Henan once launched an attack on Zhanqiao. Our forces met them head-on and defeated them one by one. The Japanese troops who invaded western Mianyang in northern Henan have been repeatedly defeated by our forces. Our forces have advanced to the outskirts of Qinyang City and are currently surrounding and fiercely attacking them.</p>
<p>Other Areas: The Japanese troops who branched out from Yishui in southern Shandong to provide reinforcements, the Japanese troops in Xintai and Laiwu who colluded to attack Lucun, and the Japanese troops in Laiwu and Tai'an who colluded to attack Miaoshanji and Chayekou have all been defeated by our forces. On the 13th, our forces also recaptured Yuanhe, Meiguanzhuang Gushan, Shuangyan, and other strongholds northeast of Juxian County. Our forces in Deping, northern Shandong, killed Japanese officer Kiyama during a mopping-up operation, seizing a large amount of military supplies. The Japanese troops invading Fanchuan in northern Jiangsu suffered over 300 casualties. Recently, trains at Lingkou Station (southeast of Danyang), Suzhou Bridge, and Longtan on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway have been blown up by landmines laid by our forces, killing over 800 Japanese soldiers. On the coast of Fujian Province, several Japanese warships and motorized boats towed civilian ships full of Japanese soldiers, attempting to raid Hanjiang in Putian on the night of the 3rd. They were fiercely attacked by our forces and immediately retreated. (10th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Warship Near Dongliu Hit by Chinese Artillery</h3>

<h3>Overseas Chinese Construction Company to Be Established Within the Year</h3>
<p>Fuzhou: The Overseas Chinese Construction Company, organized by overseas Fujianese such as Zheng Yushu, Hu Wenhu, Dai Kuiheng, and Huang Hanliang, will be established within the year to pool the financial resources of overseas Fujianese and develop their hometowns. Its construction plans are divided into wartime and postwar periods. During wartime, the main focus will be on reclaiming wasteland, cultivating special products, and establishing more factories. The company plans to raise 50 million in overseas Chinese shares. Zheng Yushu and Hu Wenhu also held a meeting in Hong Kong in mid-last month and decided to actively collect share capital. Fujian Chairman Chen Yi hopes that Hu will return to Fujian for a visit to conduct preliminary investigations to facilitate investment by overseas Chinese.</p>
<h3>Shuangpo River Resumes Navigation; Yellow River Breaches in Henan Province Closed</h3>
<p>Zhengzhou: After the Yellow River changed its course southward in the summer of 1938, the Shuangpo River in central Henan was affected, becoming silted up and halting navigation. The entire river, from Xinzheng to Fugou, flows into the Jialu River for forty kilometers. The Yellow River Commission, in order to restore navigation, has been renovating it since April of this year. First, the accumulated water in Weimou territory was drained, and the Hongmao ditch and the tail of the Shuangpo River were dredged. Then, hard beaches were excavated and bridges were renovated in counties such as Dunling and Weichuan, and over 4,000 trees obstructing navigation were cut down. The two breaches in Weishi Gaomiao and Weichuan Nanguan have also been blocked. Now that river transportation has resumed, the residents on both banks are delighted. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Zheng County: The new Yellow River flood control embankment was completed last autumn. From Zheng County to Shouji in Anhui Province, it is over 500 li long. Due to the large amount of work and limited funds during construction, the height of the embankment is only about 1.1 meters, and there is no revetment engineering, so the flood control capacity is relatively weak. The most dangerous section is in the Weishi area. During this year's major flood, the Yellow River water rose sharply, with a flow rate of over 10,000 cubic meters per second. The water overflowed the top of the embankment. During the spring, a sub-levee of high width and meters was urgently built to resist the water. However, due to the excessive water force and wind and waves, the sub-levee could not withstand it, and four breaches occurred successively at Shilipu, Shaojiuhuang, Siqian Zhangkou, and Zhang Tie (all in Weishi territory). The Shaojiuhuang opening is 97 meters long, the various Qiankou gates are 734 meters long, and the Siqian Zhangkou opening is 2,605 meters long. Subsequently, after day and night emergency blocking by Yellow River Commission stationed personnel, the Shaojiuhuang and Shilipu two openings have been closed. The Siqian Zhangkou and Zhang Tie two departments can be completed by the end of this month, not only will farming continue uninterrupted, but the river defense will also be further consolidated.

<h3>Residents of Xiangyang and Fancheng Enjoy Increasing Stability; Abundant Autumn Harvest and Low Prices; Various Businesses Flourish</h3>
<p>Fancheng: I have worked in the Xiangyang and Fancheng area for over two years and have witnessed all the wartime dynamics of a city. Although it has been repeatedly shaken, it can still stand firm, support the remnant situation in Henan and Hubei, and ensure the southeast gateway of the great northwest. The staunch spirit is admirable. I will briefly describe the past situation and current situation of Xiangyang and Fancheng. For more than a year, Xiangyang and Fancheng have been located on the front line of the war, and have been subjected to fierce bombings by Japanese aircraft from time to time, and property and life have inevitably been slightly damaged. However, the general residents are eager to return to their homeland, and their determination to defend is firm. Under the guidance of the authorities, they work together to resist the war. Houses are repeatedly destroyed and rebuilt, and the market becomes more prosperous. Various businesses have never been shaken by the ravages of Japanese aircraft or the presence of Japanese troops. During this summer's war in Henan and Hubei, Xiangyang was briefly entered by Japanese troops on the afternoon of June 1st, but it was recaptured by our forces the next morning. However, tens of thousands of houses inside and outside the city were almost reduced to ashes, with only about 2-3% remaining. Fancheng and Xiangyang are across the river from each other. Since the Japanese army could not occupy it, they first bombed it with aircraft and artillery. Thick smoke rose, and the fire shone for ten miles at once. Although the Chinese soldiers and civilians were a hundred times braver, and did not avoid the rain of bullets, they drove away the Japanese while putting out the fire. Half of the houses in the city were destroyed by artillery fire. As a result, Xiangyang, a city famous in history, became a rubble yard, with broken bricks and broken machinery scattered in the alleys, and sheer walls and ruined walls standing on the streets. More than 100,000 people were displaced and homeless. Later, after being comforted and relieved by the authorities, they first ate and slept in the open air and ran hundreds of businesses in the mounds and alleys, and then, with the assistance of the engineering troops of various units, built new houses and rectified the shops. They received enthusiastic relief from all parties, including: (1) 200,000 yuan from the Central Government, (2) 100,000 yuan from Chiang Kai-shek's wife for the rescue of women and children, (3) 10,000 yuan from the Hubei Provincial Government, and (4) several tens of thousands of yuan from a certain group army stationed there. Life has gradually stabilized. In addition, this autumn is a year of good harvests, and prices are low. Top rice costs five yuan per dou, and the market is very active. All kinds of businesses are showing a thriving trend. The people have suffered this painful lesson and have universally participated in various organizations such as transportation and rescue teams, and are very enthusiastic about national construction savings and winter clothing fundraising. Recently, a certain group army has used 10,000 yuan from the fines for handling private goods to purchase 100 mu of land in the Guangchang Square of Fancheng's Four Officials' Store, and during the slack season, they use military engineering to provide relief and use the abandoned bricks from the city walls to build a park for the military and civilians to enjoy after work. From now on, the scenery on the banks of the Xiangjiang River will be renewed, the military and civilians will be invigorated, and the construction force will be so great that it is a proof of the inevitable victory of the Chinese army.

<h3>Yu Hongqi and Zhang Shanzi Pass Away in Sichuan</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Yu Hongqi, Supervisor of the Control Yuan of the National Government, courtesy name Fanting, was a native of Louxia, Shandong.

When the National Government established its capital in Nanjing and the Control Yuan was established, he was immediately appointed as a member of the first session, serving until now. He was loyal, honest, and dedicated to his duties. He died of accumulated overwork on the 18th of this month in the Beibei residence, at the age of 64. President Yu and all his friends deeply mourned his passing. Yesterday, Central Committee Member Ding Weifen and Zhang Youlun, a member of President Yu's advisory staff, went to Beibei to pay their respects.

<h3>German and Italian Actions in the Balkans Increase Tension</h3>
<p>Hungarian Capital: Tension in the Balkans is increasing daily as news reaching here indicates that over 500,000 troops have been amassed along the Bulgarian-Greek border. A direct telephone line is reportedly in operation between Salonica and Istanbul. It is also said that Soviet-Axis military talks are underway at a port on the Adriatic Sea, though this has not been confirmed. The semi-official newspaper "Slovo" stated today that Turkey "may encounter the same tragedy as Holland and Belgium" and that the Soviet Union is unwilling to aid Turkey. (20th International News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Rome: Italian Prime Minister Mussolini departed last night for Fiume (Finme) on Italy's southern border. There are signs that the Axis powers are eager to consolidate their control over Southeastern Europe, and Mussolini's trip is one of them. Rome Radio stated that the Italian Prime Minister arrived in Forli and explained that "the Premier will inspect troops along the eastern border tomorrow." It is unknown whether Italian Foreign Minister Ciano has also left Rome. News from the Hungarian capital indicates that the Axis powers are threatening Greece and Turkey with military action, demanding that they leave Britain and join the Axis group. The Italian Foreign Ministry's organ, International Relations, stated that all Balkan issues must be resolved immediately. The newspaper also said, "The shadows in the Balkans must be resolutely removed by Italy with the firmest means. Italy's influence in the Balkans must not be curbed, hesitation is unreasonable, and delay is illegal." (10th International News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Rome: Italian Prime Minister's mouthpiece Gayda published an article warning Greece and Turkey against falling into Eden's trap and stating that if Britain interferes in Greece and Turkey, it will be retaliated against. (20th Huitong News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Turkey Concentrates Large Army, Determined to Resist Aggression</p>
<p>Istanbul: It was indicated here last night that Turkey is currently planning to mobilize all reserve officers who have not yet reached the expiration of their term, those aged between twenty and forty, who have special proof of having completed university courses, have been ordered to report before the end of this month to complete one year of service. (20th United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Rome's "People's Daily" carried an article today stating that Turkish troops are now concentrated along the Çaatalca line, estimated to number between 400,000 and 500,000. It is also reported that the Turkish General Staff has set up a headquarters in Adrianople. The report goes on to say that the Greek capital attaches great importance to the British Minister of War, Eden, visiting Istanbul or the capitals of Turkey and Greece, believing that the strength of the British fleet in the Mediterranean will be enhanced as a result. In short, the attitude of Turkey and Greece is now gradually becoming firmer. (20th Huitong News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Cairo: A Reuters correspondent recently traveled 1,300 miles from Istanbul via Syria and Palestine to Cairo and gained two major impressions: one is Turkey's determination to resist foreign aggression, and the other is the treacherous and difficult terrain of Anatolia in winter. Former Turkish President Kemal, knowing that the Turkish army is weaker than the Western powers in terms of mechanized units, has laid out dangerous roads and stopped building some roads that could benefit invading troops. If German troops enter Turkey, they will feel a lack of oil, food, and munitions because the Danube River freezes for many months and cannot transport these essential items.

<p>Berlin Denies Ultimatum to Greece</p>
<p>Athens: Last night, the Greek government denied reports that the Axis powers had issued a three-part ultimatum to the Greek government. Senior government officials here stated that the report was pure mythology and denied rumors that Greek King George had abdicated. (20th United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Berlin: Yesterday, responsible authorities here denied rumors spread abroad that the Axis powers were putting pressure on the Balkans to join the Axis bloc. When receiving reporters yesterday, the German spokesman said that Germany had not made a final request to Greece, and the English claims that the relationship between Germany, Greece and Turkey was strained were also completely unfounded. The new Europe must be based on the political system of the Axis powers, which is inevitable, so there is no need for pressure from Berlin. If there are still people in Europe who believe in democracy, they can follow the policies they adopt, but for the newly created Europe, they will miss the opportunity. Regarding this level, there seems to be no need for the German government to formally notify the governments of various countries. The war against England has now progressed to the fourth act, and if ignorant amateur diplomats still believe that it is in the first act, we cannot care. The meeting of English diplomats in Istanbul must be in preparation for retreat, and the Axis powers will undoubtedly be able to take the lead in Southeastern Europe. (20th Huitong Electric)</p>

<p>German Troops Enter Romanian Territory; Soviet Union Protests to Germany</p>
<p>Bucharest: According to unconfirmed reports circulating in Viennese political circles, the Soviet Union has sent two dispatches to Germany regarding the entry of German troops into Romanian territory. The first dispatch urged Germany to note that Southeast Europe is regarded as Germany's economic hinterland, but not its political hinterland. It is said that Germany replied that there are signs that Britain is preparing to attack Southeast Europe, and Germany has therefore had to adopt a military plan to ensure the fulfillment of Southeast Europe's economic obligations to Germany. The Soviet Union's second dispatch inquired as to the purpose of the German troops' deep penetration into Romanian territory, and whether Germany was aware that some Romanian and Hungarian elements harbored the idea of assisting Germany in attacking the Soviet Union. Germany reportedly replied that Germany's mission was to create a defensive structure in Romania, not an offensive one. According to people in Bucharest, German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop will soon go to Moscow in an attempt to persuade the Soviet Union to join the German-Italian-Japanese alliance. Nazi propaganda in the area is now trying to promote the idea that German-Soviet relations will be closer in the future and will not be alienated by Britain. However, military authorities are still receiving reports that the Soviet Union is engaged in large-scale defense plans in Bessarabia, and it is rumored that the railroad there is now dedicated to military transport. However, the Romanian Communist Party does not believe that there will be a rapid conflict between Germany and the Soviet Union, because, according to telegrams from Moscow, the Soviet Union will not suddenly change its attitude toward Germany, because the Soviet Union does not want to conflict with Germany at this time.

<p>Romania's Situation Deteriorates Daily; People Filled with Sadness and Indignation</p>
<p>Vienna: The entry of German troops into Romania is still more a matter of moving troops to find food than a military occupation. German staff members and soldiers seem to be focusing on finding the best restaurants, rather than finding strategic gun emplacements. Political circles here believe that Germany's flaunting of its mechanized forces is intended to protect the Iron Guard, to avoid internal political opposition or the disloyalty of soldiers, and not only to defend the borders. German soldiers are now systematically sending food packages home every week. German officers have begun to make dissatisfied criticisms of entering and leaving the streets, so they have changed into civilian clothes to avoid people's attention. There is now evidence to show that even members of the Iron Guard do not fully welcome the deep penetration of German troops. The Iron Guard members in outer Transylvania are said to be extremely resentful that Germany not only transferred most of outer Transylvania to Hungary, but also sent troops directly into Romania, and they have destroyed their blue shirts and accused their Iron Guard comrades of not agreeing to the Vienna territorial cession to Hungary, and have asked them to join the Aid to Outer Transylvania Association led by former Romanian Prime Minister Maniu, which aims to recover lost territory. Secret short-wave wireless broadcasts have recently been heard throughout Romania, warning Iron Guard leader and acting Prime Minister Sima that if he does not want to die, he should quickly go to the mountains. These wireless broadcasts are definitely being sent out by dissatisfied members of the Iron Guard. At the same time, the Romanian newspapers are also crying out about the rapid rise in the cost of living, with the price of bread and other goods doubling, and the people's food is gradually becoming scarce. In order to comfort the people, the government has announced measures to improve stores, selling food only to registered customers. (20th Reuters Electric)</p>

<h3>Hungarian Miners Brew Strike with Political Background</h3>
<p>Budapest. The strike wave involving 40,000 miners and thousands of other workers has now reached its extreme. The Sakota mine was restless last week. The miners demanded a 50% wage increase. The Hungarian government immediately prepared to make concessions to compensate for the sharp rise in living costs, but the labor unrest gradually spread, and other mines followed suit, which was obviously related to the activities of the fifth column of the Hungarian Arrow Cross Party, which was instructed by the Nazi Party. The radical elements of the party are suspected of inciting the miners. This labor unrest coincided with Major General Czelassy's visit to Vienna to meet with senior Nazi Party members. The beggar government is now handling the labor unrest with vigilance and gentle means to prevent it from turning into a major political event. Observers regard this entire event as extremely meaningful. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)</p>

In addition, several other houses and residences were also bombed. German planes used the bright moon and clear weather to bomb the British capital for several hours without ceasing.

At the same time, it was also heard that Liverpool encountered the longest air raid. Many residences were destroyed and damaged, including an uninhabited nursery. The Nazi night hawks spread throughout the three islands of Central England last night and concentrated their fierce attacks on London.

<p>Washington – With the U.S. presidential election just weeks away, the Democratic and Republican parties have entered the final decisive stage of a large-scale political battle. Political observers here believe that the Democratic Party has recently shown signs of unease, while the Republican Party has become more optimistic.

<h3>New Position for the Duke of Windsor</h3>
<p>The Duke of Windsor, who "gave up his kingdom for love," formerly King Edward VIII of England, has been inseparable from his American wife, Mrs. Simpson, ever since their marriage.

They were originally living in France as residents, and after the outbreak of the European war, they returned to their country to serve. He initially served as a liaison officer for the Anglo-French Allied Forces, and later his brother, George VI, appointed him as the Governor of the Bahamas, which was also a significant "goodwill mission" to the United States. The Duke of Windsor gladly accepted the appointment and left Europe for Bermuda in early August, then transferred to the Bahamas. On the 17th, he took his official oath in the capital, Nassau. To have such a former King who abandoned his crown as if it were worn-out shoes and once caused a sensation around the world, come to this small island in the Atlantic Ocean to serve as a civil governor and commander-in-chief of the army and navy is already a great appeal in terms of personality alone. With the American newspapers adding to the hype, people with strong curiosity and Americans who sympathized with the Duke of Windsor took advantage of the excitement to visit the Bahamas. The saying "outstanding people make a place outstanding" is certainly true. The following is a translation based on reports from "The New York Times," "The Christian Science Monitor," and "Time":</p>
<p>Compared to the position of King of Great Britain, the position of Governor of the Bahamas is truly insignificant. The Bahamian archipelago is northeast of Cuba and includes 18 small islands, 661 reefs, and more than 2,000 reef chains scattered in the Atlantic Ocean, in addition to the island of "New Providence," where the capital, Nassau, is located. The British territory formerly ruled by King Edward VIII of England covered more than 13.32 million square miles, with a population of 495 million. Now, the area of the Bahamas Islands is 4,666 square miles, with a total population of 67,000, three-quarters of whom live in "New Providence."</p>
<p>The disparity in importance between the throne relinquished by the Duke of Windsor and the governorship he now holds is immeasurable, so let's not dwell on it. Another strange thing is that the object to whom he swore allegiance and obedience is his own brother, George VI. Extraordinary people do extraordinary things, and the Duke of Windsor can be said to deserve the title.</p>
<p>On the day of their departure from Europe for Bermuda, they boarded the 9,359-ton passenger-cargo ship "Excalibur." The entire voyage across the Atlantic takes eight days. Although this ship is a freighter, this particular voyage was indeed carrying some distinguished guests. The passenger list was headed by the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, followed by U.S. Ambassador to Italy Philip and his daughter, U.S. Ambassador to Poland Biddle and his wife, U.S. Minister to the Netherlands Gordon and his wife, and other dignitaries.</p>
<p>The Duchess of Windsor boarded in Lisbon and brought with her three beagles, 52 pieces of luggage, a hand-cranked sewing machine, golf clubs, four wicker baskets filled with fine vintage wines, a 1940s-style car, and a family-style trailer. As for the Duke of Windsor, he lingered at a reception at the home of the Portuguese tycoon Sherva and arrived at the dock late. The "Excalibur" had to wait and not set sail for the time being. Several dignitaries, such as British Ambassador to Portugal Sir Campbell and his wife, were also waiting there to see him off. The first rule of the British royal family states: "Punctuality is the politeness of kings," but the Duke of Windsor was unrestrained and delayed for a full forty minutes before he and his host Sherva and others arrived leisurely. Three of his subordinates, all old schoolmates from Eton, also boarded the ship with him.</p>
<p>The Duke himself would have preferred to cross the Atlantic by "clipper" flying boat, but his wife often insisted, "I don't want to fly." It is undeniable that Windsor did not want to go against his wife's wishes, but there was another reason on the Duchess's side. It turned out that one of Mrs. Simpson's three ex-husbands had been a U.S. Navy pilot, and she was not only familiar with aircraft accidents but had also witnessed them. As a result, she hated airplanes as much as she "didn't want to see cats." She often said, "I pray that trains never have a breakdown."</p>
<p>After leaving Lisbon, the weather was calm, the waves were quiet, and the sea was smooth. The ship sailed on the ocean like the train in Mrs. Windsor's dreams. Before long, a "clipper" flying boat flew overhead, roaring in the air. The Duke of Windsor went up to the bridge, waved to the flying boat, and exchanged greetings with the captain of the flying boat by wireless. There was also a distinguished guest on the flying boat, but he was resting at the time and did not notice the Duke of Windsor waving on the ship. He was the French financier Baron Rothschild, who had gone abroad to take refuge. After Edward abdicated and before marrying Mrs. Simpson, he had once lived in his villa for a period of retirement.</p>
<p>The Windsors lived in a suite on the ship, which also had a private balcony. They hosted private banquets for the American diplomat couples on board, but they also occasionally took their dogs for walks on the public deck. The Duchess of Windsor and Mrs. Gordon, the wife of the U.S. Minister to the Netherlands, were old friends who had met in Washington. Mrs. Gordon, Alice, was the daughter of a wealthy family. In the past, every time she returned to the United States from Europe, she would bring back many fashionable clothes from Paris. Mrs. Simpson did not have much money at the time and could not afford the latest Parisian fashions, but Alice often asked her to call a female tailor to "copy" those fashions as much as possible. As a result, the two hit it off and became more than just casual acquaintances.</p>
<p>On August 8th, they arrived in Bermuda. The Windsors disembarked, and their 50-plus pieces of luggage were also landed. However, these boxes and bags were only personal necessities. Just the uniforms, badges, and ribbons in the "official" luggage filled several boxes. The Duke of Windsor had left these items in France and had not taken them out of the country.</p>
<p>On August 14th, the Windsors boarded the Canadian Steamship Company's "Lady Somers" and set off from Bermuda for the Bahamas to take up their new posts. A reporter from the New York Times traveled on the same ship and had the opportunity to meet the Windsors during the two-and-a-half-day voyage. His observations are roughly as follows:</p>
<p>The 780 miles from Bermuda to the Bahamas were patrolled by a British light cruiser, which sailed east and west, scouting everywhere. The "Lady Somers" set sail at 2:00 PM on Wednesday, and the journey proceeded without incident. In the afternoon of the 16th, a plume of smoke was suddenly spotted on the eastern horizon, and the cruiser sailed east to investigate. It was later discovered that the smoke was coming from the chimney of an American oil tanker. At this time, the Duke and Duchess were sitting in chairs on the deck, and when they saw the crew members looking east with binoculars, they asked, "Are they going to open fire?"</p>
<p>Every night, the entire ship was blacked out, and smoking on the deck was prohibited. There were not many passengers on board, and everyone was quite relaxed. The Windsors were quite amiable. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Preliminary Discussion on China's Post-War Balance of Payments</h3>
<p>— Yu Chongxian</p>
<p>A Miracle? Or Inevitability?</p>
<p>China's war of resistance has now reached forty months: but the external exchange rate of Chinese legal tender, despite being unarmed and surrounded by enemies, is still calm and composed. Observers both within and outside the country cannot but recognize this as a miracle in the history of war finance. Purely from an economic point of view, there is no reason for the external exchange rate of Chinese legal tender (referring to the Shanghai black market exchange rate) to remain at its current level for a long time. Considering only Shanghai's foreign trade, the monthly trade deficit has recently often exceeded three million pounds. And the national trade deficit has often exceeded six million pounds per month in recent months. Shanghai's own trade deficit should of course be paid for by seeking funds from Shanghai's foreign exchange market; as for the trade deficits in other places, a part of them is also realized through foreign payments in Shanghai's foreign exchange market through remittances from various places to Shanghai. Shanghai's foreign exchange supply cannot be inexhaustible, so from this point of view, almost everyone believes that there is no reason for the external exchange rate of Chinese currency not to collapse. However, in fact, the exchange rate of legal tender in the Shanghai black market can still show its strong resistance force; and can even rise sharply in favorable opportunities; this is the miracle in the history of wartime finance.</p>
<p>How can such a scene be possible? At present, there is no satisfactory explanation, or it is believed that the firmness of the exchange rate in the past few months is due to the unpredictable changes in the domestic and international situation, and the sudden occurrence of negative facts, and the spread of rumors of heavy losses. However, although adverse events continue to occur and rumors of adverse events are endless, their effect is only like the use of stimulants on the human body, which is temporary in nature; the exchange rate of legal tender can never be supported by rumors for a long time. In the long run, empty rumors cannot resist economic pressure; therefore, the stability of the legal tender exchange rate must be due to other reasons.</p>
<p>In any case, tangible trade deficits should be paid for with intangible income. Maintaining a stable exchange rate is equivalent to saying that our balance of payments can support the existing exchange rate level. In fact, our tangible trade imports and exports have such a huge deficit, so our intangible trade receipts and payments must have a surplus of the same amount; otherwise, the exchange rate will not be maintained. The current research should focus on: what are the items that constitute this intangible income? What is the elasticity of its contraction, and what is the direction of its change? If we can have a thorough understanding of this, it will greatly contribute to the understanding of the trend of China's wartime foreign exchange rate. However, this is very difficult to carry out, because the complexity of the issues involved, and the fact that some prerequisite issues are not easily resolved without a very long investigation time. Therefore, it is impossible to conduct a thorough study at present. Now, based on my personal views, I will briefly state this issue.</p>
<p>Comparison of Tangible Receipts and Payments During Wartime</p>
<p>China's tangible trade has always been in deficit, but China's balance of payments cannot be in deficit for a long time; therefore, there must be a method to balance it. The current research should focus on whether this balancing method still exists? Has the amount changed? At the same time, observe the current amount of the deficit and compare it with the amount of the deficit in the past. Is it increasing or decreasing? Can it be offset by the existing balance of payments method? Such indirect evidence seems to be able to clarify its general situation. Now I will explain it separately.</p>
<p>First, please measure our ability to support the deficit over the years. The study of this issue should use historical data as a reference. According to my rough calculation, from 1920 to 1929, in the ten years, China's average annual deficit was 200 million yuan. According to the average exchange rate in these ten years, it was 20 million pounds per year; and 1.8 million pounds per month. However, after 1930, the deficit increased rapidly. From 1930 to 1936, in the seven years, the average annual deficit was 500 million yuan; according to the average exchange rate in these seven years, it was 36 million pounds per year, and 3 million pounds per month. If these seventeen years are combined into one period, the average annual deficit is 27 million pounds, and the monthly average is 2.25 million pounds. Our balance of payments cannot be in deficit for a long time, and there must be a method to balance it. Therefore, in these seventeen years, the receipts and payments of other items must have a surplus roughly equal to this amount. Otherwise, trade and exchange will not be able to proceed smoothly.</p>
<p>Since the tangible trade deficit must be offset by the intangible trade surplus, then in these seventeen years, my country's foreign intangible trade must have an annual surplus of nearly 27 million pounds; the monthly average intangible balance of payments should be around 2.2 million pounds. If we only calculate the situation after 1930, the average annual intangible balance of payments should be 36 million pounds, and the monthly average should be 3 million pounds. The balance of payments over a long period of time must be balanced, which is a fixed rule in international receipts. In this way, we can assume that the above-mentioned average is my country's ability to tolerate commodity import surplus during normal times. (Ability to foartd import surplus of commodityrradfng items) If our tangible trade deficit exceeds the above-mentioned average figure, our balance of payments will have a deficit; foreign exchange reserves will be eroded. If our country's monetary authorities are unwilling to sell foreign exchange reserves to balance this deficit; then our foreign exchange rate will be lowered. On the contrary, if our tangible trade deficit is lower than the above-mentioned figure; then my country's balance of payments will have a surplus; foreign exchange reserves will be more abundant; if the monetary authorities refuse to absorb foreign exchange at a fixed price, then my country's foreign exchange rate will be squeezed higher. Based on the calculation of the above-mentioned historical data, we can proceed to discuss the post-war issue.</p>
<p>General Trend of International Balance of Payments Before the War</p>
<p>There are two issues worth noting here: how does the post-war tangible deficit compare with the pre-war period? One is what is the content of our intangible income, and has there been any change in the post-war period? And what is the possible limit of its change? Estimating these two variables, and then observing the profit and loss situation, we can understand the general situation of the post-war balance of payments. Now I will explain them separately as follows.</p>
<p>First, let's talk about the tangible trade deficit: from the beginning of the war in 1937 to the present, the average annual deficit, converted into pounds, is 45 million pounds, and the average monthly deficit is slightly less than 3.8 million pounds. Comparing this number with the average figure of 17 years before the war, the annual deficit has increased by 18 million pounds, and the monthly average has increased by 1.5 million pounds. If we compare it with the average figure of 7 years before the war, the annual deficit has increased by 9 million pounds, and the monthly average has increased by 800,000 pounds. The earlier the era, the less reliable it is. Therefore, it seems more reliable to base the argument on the latter calculation. In summary, we know that my country's post-war tangible deficit is indeed higher than before the war, and slightly exceeds the strength of the human overspending that we calculated earlier that we could tolerate during normal times; the annual excess is 9 million pounds, and the annual average excess is slightly less than 800,000 pounds. This is from the expenditure side.</p>
<p>Comparison of Intangible Receipts and Payments During Wartime</p>
<p>Please analyze the content of my country's intangible income, and the possible changes in the post-war period. First, explain the changes in the original income items, and then explain the newly added items in the post-war period.</p>
<p>According to the main items of China's intangible income, there are two: one is remittances from overseas Chinese, and the other is the expenses of foreigners in China. The former was estimated at between 300 million and 500 million yuan per year before the war, and the latter was generally estimated at more than 100 million yuan. According to the legal exchange rate of legal tender against foreign currency before the war, remittances from overseas Chinese were between 22 million and 30 million pounds per year; and the expenses of foreigners in China were 8-9 million pounds. Because the estimates of each company vary slightly, we now adopt a moderate and more general statement, assuming that the income from these two items before the war was 35 million pounds per year, which can roughly offset the annual tangible trade deficit in the seven years before the war.</p>
<p>What we want to study now is how has this income increased or decreased in the post-war period? First, let's talk about remittances from overseas Chinese: although most of the coastal cities of Fujian and Guangdong have fallen, the remittance channels have not been interrupted, but the difficulty has increased slightly. After the war, due to the rise in prices and the increase in relocation costs, the remittances from overseas Chinese to provide for their families must increase their amount. However, this factor should be offset by the appreciation of foreign currency; because the same amount of foreign currency can be remitted for more legal tender. In addition, some overseas Chinese families have moved to Hong Kong or overseas, so the amount of remittances from overseas Chinese after the war has greatly increased in terms of legal tender; if calculated in foreign currency, it may be reduced instead. But there is another point worth noting here, that is, overseas Chinese are very patriotic, and the amount of donations to the government after the war is quite considerable. It is estimated that the government's foreign currency income from this source totaled more than 50 million yuan in the three years after the war. This amount seems to be more than enough to offset the reduction in private remittances. Therefore, the amount of remittances from overseas Chinese after the war seems to have not decreased but increased slightly; at least it can be assumed that it has not decreased.</p>
<p>Regarding the expenses of foreigners in China, it seems to have decreased after the war; the reason is the withdrawal of foreigners from various places and the reduction and withdrawal of troops. However, the number of reductions should not be large, because there are many foreigners who come to China for special purposes after the war; the newly added expenses can offset a part of the reduction in the original foreign expenses. And after the war, foreigners donated a lot to my country for medical relief, etc.; the total of this cumulative calculation, the expenses of foreigners in China after the war may have increased instead.</p>
<p>In summary, it can be seen that the surplus of my country's intangible income to offset the tangible deficit seems to have not weakened compared with the pre-war period. If the tangible deficit after the war still maintains the pre-war level, the balance of payments after the war may not be difficult. However, as mentioned above, our tangible deficit after the war has indeed increased compared with the pre-war period. The cumulative increase in the past three years has been more than 30 million pounds. How is this number balanced? At the same time, there is still a huge amount of foreign exchange held by the people, how should this be explained? All of this is what I want to explain finally.</p>
<p>Regarding this point, we should study the newly added income items in the post-war period. What are these newly added income items? Now I will list them as follows:</p>
<p>The government's disposition of a portion of foreign exchange reserves. According to the statistics, from the beginning of the war to the implementation of the foreign exchange examination system in March of the following year, the government sold foreign exchange to stabilize the exchange market, which is estimated to be about 20 million pounds. After that, during the period of implementation of the foreign exchange examination system, another 5 million pounds were disposed of successively; since the attempt to stabilize the exchange market in August of the previous year, to the period of activity of the Sino-British Equalization Fund, the foreign exchange sold but not bought back is also estimated to be about 5 million pounds. The foreign exchange positions released by the government in these three is also between 30 million pounds. This number is enough to balance the total expenditure difference after adding the tangible and intangible receipts and payments after the war.</p>
<p>Based on the above estimation, plus the foreign exchange disposed of by the government, in the three years after the war. My country's total receipts and payments seem to be balanced. But why is there still a part of the foreign exchange held by the people in Shanghai? This can be regarded as the accumulated surplus of receipts and payments in the past three years, because it has not been used for foreign payments. But why must there still be other income, so that this part of the foreign exchange can not be used? Regarding this point, I have the following opinions:</p>
<p>(1) After the war, a considerable amount of legal tender flowed overseas for price changes; this should be one of the newly added income for us. It is estimated that the legal tender flowing to Hong Kong, excluding the government's, is 400 million yuan, which is equivalent to 10 million pounds.</p>
<p>(2) Funds from the Nanyang area (including Hong Kong) have flowed inward in the past year. Although a reliable estimate cannot be made for this amount now, the total amount must be quite considerable. The above two factors seem to be very important for the question of why we have a foreign surplus in the past three years? (That is, some foreign exchange in Shanghai's private sector has not been used)</p>
<p>The above is my tentative explanation of China's balance of payments in the past three years. From this, we can know that the intangible income that we can use to offset the tangible deficit has not decreased compared with the pre-war period. However, our tangible deficit is slightly higher than the average level before the war; but it has not decreased to the point where it cannot be supported. This is probably an intrinsic great force for why the external exchange rate of my country's legal tender can still maintain a relatively stable level after a long war of three years.</p>
<p>Editor's note: The fluctuations in the Shanghai black market exchange market cannot be fully explained by the international balance of payments situation; and the changes in the exchange market can in turn affect the international balance of payments. Mr. Yu pointed out that the stability of the exchange market before the foreign exchange control was due to the government's full supply, which is very true. However, the amount of the deficit at that time was not as large as it is today, and the amount of foreign donations and offerings was indeed large. It is a pity that the capital flight before and after the war was also extremely large. However, the two offset each other, and even if there was still a deficit, it would probably not be large. Therefore, the so-called loss suffered by the government due to maintenance may not be very large. However, after the implementation of the exchange control and even the occurrence of the black market exchange market, the situation changed greatly. Because the greater the distance between the black exchange and the legal price, the higher the degree of capital flight and speculation; the driving force of capital flight, in addition to the economic point of view, must also come from the political point of view. And the advancement of speculative fever, if there is effective crackdown, it will definitely not be like this; therefore, it can also be said that it is related to politics. The increase in capital flight and speculation has greatly affected the international balance of payments; and further reflects its impact on the black market exchange market, and finally creates the current phenomenon. Today, the situation is different again, because the phenomenon of capital flight induced from a political point of view has decreased, even disappearing; and most of it flows back. The decline in capital flight has shaken the foreign exchange bullish speculative front; and the return of fleeing capital has further strengthened the short speculative front. And the international war clouds are dense, and the war is approaching; the feasibility of international trade is becoming smaller, and the need for foreign exchange is even more affected. These facts, psychologically, are even more sufficient to promote the short-selling force. Therefore, according to Yu's view, the change in the black exchange price is not the result of the international balance of payments; and the current situation of the international balance of payments is affected by the black exchange price; and the black market exchange market is mainly composed of speculators; and the views of these speculators are mostly pessimistic. Therefore, it is more approximate to explain the purchasing power of legal tender expressed on the black market exchange market from a political point of view than to analyze it from an economic point of view. However, under the influence of the black market exchange market, what is the situation of my country's international balance of payments? Mr. Yu's article has contributed many unique insights.</p>
<h3>Our Wartime Finance (Continued Completion)</h3>
<p>— Yu Xielin</p>
<p>Appropriate Wartime Public Debt Policy</p>
<p>According to the established practice of wartime finance in various countries, the expenditure to pay for war expenses is less taken from increased taxes, and more taken from raising debts. Because raising debts conforms to the principles of agility and convenience, it can raise huge sums of money in a short period of time to cope with sudden changes in extraordinary times, or the huge expenditure of war expenses, which taxes cannot match. However, if all war expenses are relied on public debt, the issuance of excess amounts will inevitably lead to vicious inflation. The repeated mistakes of Germany and France during the last war are still vivid. Therefore, the wartime public debt policy, if not handled properly, will inevitably leave endless harm. Therefore, our country's financial authorities have always adopted a prudent attitude towards the public debt policy, and have never had a huge amount of issuance from beginning to end, so that the national economy has suffered greatly. Since the beginning of the war, our country has successively issued the 26th Year National Salvation Public Debt of 500 million yuan; the 27th Year National Defense Public Debt of 500 million yuan; the 27th Year Gold Public Debt includes 100 million units of customs gold, 10 million pounds of British gold, and 50 million yuan of US gold. According to the price set by the government, it is equivalent to more than 550 million yuan of national currency; the 27th Year Relief Public Debt of 100 million yuan, the first phase of 30 million yuan; the 28th Year Construction Public Debt of 600 million yuan; the 28th Year Military Public Debt of 600 million yuan; the 29th Year Construction Gold Public Debt includes 10 million pounds of British gold and 50 million yuan of US gold. According to the price set by the government, it is equivalent to more than 700 million yuan of national currency; the 29th Year Military Public Debt of 1.2 billion yuan. The total is only 1.7-1.8 billion yuan, and a part of it has not actually been issued yet, such as the 29th Year Construction Gold Public Debt, which is issued in two phases, and the second phase must be issued on November 1 this year. This quantity is very small compared with Japan. The following characteristics can be obtained from the above. (1) From the Anti-Japanese War to last year, that is, the second period, the government attaches equal importance to the Anti-Japanese War and national construction, so it issued military public debt to pay for war expenses, and construction public debt to engage in national construction. (2) The issuance of gold public debt is to absorb the foreign exchange or foreign currency owned by the people in the country, and to facilitate the purchase of overseas Chinese, so as to replenish the legal tender reserve and enhance my country's wartime foreign purchasing power. (3) During this wartime, the government did not forget the natural disasters suffered by the localities, so it issued relief public debt to relieve the people who suffered from the Yellow River flood. Observing the issuance regulations of our country's wartime public debt, the following characteristics can also be obtained: (1) The interest rate is lower, such as the National Salvation Public Debt of 2%, which can be called the first in the history of our domestic debt. The gold public debt in the 17th year is 4%, and the construction gold public debt in the 29th year is 5%, and the rest are still 6%. (2) The discount is reduced. The wartime public debt was only issued at 98 for the relief public debt in the 27th year, and 94 for the military public debt in the 29th year, and the rest were all issued at full value, which is indeed a major reform of our country's public debt system. The issuance of our country's wartime public debt can reduce the interest and discount compared with peacetime public debt. This phenomenon is rare in Chinese and foreign history. This is because our country's finances are gradually becoming sound, and the people are enthusiastically subscribing.</p>
<p>As the saying goes: "Those who gain the Tao get more help." Our country is fighting for world justice, so British and American people have expressed sympathy for our country's Anti-Japanese War and have given us financial assistance. For example, the railway loan in the 17th year and October was 150 million French francs and 140,000 pounds; the Soviet Union's two-way barter loan of 100 million US dollars in the same year; the US loan of 25 million yuan in November of the same year; the British currency loan of 5 million pounds in January of the 28th year. There are many others that have been established but have not been officially announced. The rest are mostly used for barter in the form of gold to repay principal and interest. The utilization of foreign capital in this way will surely be of great help to the promotion of our country's construction. And at the time of repayment of principal and interest, it is not enough to increase the financial burden, and can improve the balance of payments.</p>
<p>Sound Wartime Issuance System</p>
<p>In addition to increasing taxes and raising debts, there is also issuing banknotes to raise war expenses. If we rely on issuing banknotes to pay for huge war expenses, although it is the most convenient, it is also the most dangerous. It is most likely to cause vicious inflation, making finance collapse and unable to extricate itself. Therefore, our country's wartime issuance still adopts the prudent policy of the past. At the end of June in the 26th year—before the outbreak of the war—the total amount of issuance by the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank was 1.40720234 billion yuan, and the cash reserve at that time was 916.518353 million yuan, and the ratio was more than 65%. By the end of June of the 27th year, the total amount of issuance was 1.726997835 billion yuan, and the cash reserve was only 1.132811067 billion yuan, and the ratio was still more than 65%. By the end of June of the 18th year, the total amount of issuance was 2.6269292 billion yuan, and the cash reserve was 1.156088974 billion yuan, and the ratio was 44%. At the end of June this year, the total amount of issuance was 3.961144205 billion yuan, and the cash reserve was 1.917526050 billion yuan, and the ratio was more than 48%. From the surface, in the past three years, the amount of legal tender issued has increased by two times. However, because the circulation area of legal tender is increasingly expanding, and the demand for currency in various places is increasingly urgent, the amount of issuance should naturally increase. Before the war, the amount of issuance was too small, and all provinces in the interior felt that the chips were insufficient. Although the current amount of issuance has increased sharply, there is still a feeling of currency contraction in various places from time to time. It can be seen that the amount of issuance in our country is not only not excessive. As for the percentage of cash reserve, although it has been reduced, it is still more than 48% to this day, which is more than that of advanced countries. As for the redemption of silver deposits, the increase in gold production, and the fact that the gold and silver collected are all used to replenish the issuance reserve, the cash reserve can also increase rapidly with the total amount of issuance, so that the foundation of legal tender is becoming more solid.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Our country, which is economically backward and financially poor, has been able to fight for three years, and has been able to cope with the huge war expenses with ease and without difficulty. This is really beyond everyone's expectations. From this, we can see the greatness of our country's potential power. Our country's financial authorities have been able to bury themselves in hard work, improve the tax system, raise public debt extensively, and use the issuance of banknotes to cope with the vast war expenses in the midst of great difficulties. So that our financial system is becoming sounder day by day, and the financial foundation is becoming more and more solid. The beginning has just been opened, and continued efforts are still needed.</p>
<h3>Soviet Trade Capital</h3>
<p>— Mr. Wu Yugan's Answer</p>
<p>Shen Chengzhao: Thank you for your questions. In addition to the Soviet-German financial system, which was answered in the previous issue of this magazine, the Soviet-German trade system was answered by Professor Wu Yugan, an international trade expert, a long time ago. The part about Germany has been published in the previous issue. The Soviet part will be published as follows:</p>
<p>How is the Soviet international trade method different from that of the United States and Britain?</p>
<p>The difference between Soviet international trade and that of the United States and Britain is that Soviet foreign trade is completely operated by the state, and is monopolized by the state; while the United States and Britain are freely operated by the private sector. Soviet international trade is to handle all matters related to trade guidance, organization, planning, and operation by the state. The central organ of her trade (People's Committee for Foreign Trade) and other important organs such as foreign commercial representatives guide everything, and also form many companies. The import and export business is distributed to these import and export trading companies. These companies handle all matters related to foreign orders and sales. However, foreign orders must be licensed by the People's Committee for Trade, and exports only need to be reported. It has also been authorized by the government to sign trade agreements with foreign experts. These companies mostly operate different types of special commodities, such as machinery imports, which are completely entrusted to the "Mlachinoimporc" import company, and oil exports are completely handed over to the "Soyusneftoxport" export company; occasionally, the import and export trade of a certain region is completely operated by one company. They are all managed by the People's Committee for Trade. The result of the Soviet Union's use of this state-run trade method is that it is particularly sufficient to meet the needs of its own economy, and at the same time it is easy to promote international political and diplomatic relations, which is beyond the reach of the trade method freely operated by the private sector in the United States and Britain.

<h3>Financial Review —October 19th—</h3>
<p>— By Sheng Kaiqiong</p>
<p>The joint office of the Central Bank, Bank of China, Communications Bank, and Farmers Bank has resolved to implement six measures for broadly establishing simple savings offices, aiming to promote savings services not only in major cities but also extensively in smaller counties, towns, and various industrial and commercial centers. The Central Trust Bureau and the Central Bank, Communications Bank, and Farmers Bank will actively prepare for this.</p>
<p>Since its reorganization in September of the 28th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1939], under the leadership of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, the joint office of the four banks has already decided to implement the wartime financial and economic plans it formulated. This includes promoting rediscounting operations, establishing a financial network, publicly inspecting the reserve funds issued by the four banks, and broadly promoting the work of gold and silver purchase. The current focus is on concentrating capital and promoting special savings. The most concrete measure for concentrating capital is the requirement in the management regulations for banks that the four banks receive 20% of the reserve funds from the deposits of other banks. The method for promoting special savings is the establishment of a National Savings Promotion Committee for Saving the Nation. On September 6th of this year, it jointly organized a National Savings Movement Committee for Saving the Nation, together with the national committee, and directed the Central Trust Bureau and the Central Bank, Communications Bank, and Farmers Bank to actively prepare for the establishment of simple savings offices.</p>
<p>After carefully reading the measures for establishing simple savings offices, I believe there are three characteristics that must be pointed out: First, the economic environment for establishing simple savings offices differs from the economic environment where the financial network is deployed. This includes places that (1) have a population of over 30,000 but no financial institutions; (2) mining areas with a large number of workers, or concentrated sections and stations along railway and highway lines; (3) cultural areas with a concentration of schools; (4) production and distribution centers for major special products; (5) inland ports with flourishing commerce and a large circulation of banknotes; and (6) large factories with over 500 workers. Second, although simple savings offices can handle all savings businesses like general savings banks, their main focus is on attracting deposits, such as paying special attention to attracting small deposits, promoting national savings bonds for saving the nation, and prize-linked savings bonds. Remittances and loans are only auxiliary, such as small remittances and small loans, which can be handled concurrently when necessary. Third, the interest rate for attracting savings in simple savings offices is higher than the interest rate for attracting savings in general savings banks. The principle is a 5% annual interest rate for demand deposits and a 10% annual interest rate for time deposits, and adjustments can be made based on local conditions, without being restricted by general savings regulations.</p>
<p>From the three points analyzed above, it can be seen that the function of simple savings offices in China's wartime finance is the same as the temporary measures for managing banks and has three major effects: (1) It can increase deposits in national banks, which can be used to develop resources and all production undertakings. Therefore, simple savings offices focus on receiving deposits so that national banks can centrally manage funds after they are concentrated. (2) It can reduce social circulation of money by saving consumption and stabilize rising prices. Therefore, simple savings offices set interest rates higher than general banks' demand deposit rates. (3) It can reduce the amount of legal tender in circulation and return it to the issuing bank to curb inflation. Therefore, the economic environment for establishing simple savings offices should be smaller counties and towns and various industrial and commercial centers.</p>
<p>Simple savings offices not only have the function of managing banks but also have the function of saving the nation through national savings. Furthermore, they have the function of remedying the shortcomings of both managing banks and saving the nation through national savings. Regarding the management of banks, the funds that can be concentrated are only 20% of what banks can concentrate. There are still funds scattered among the people that banks cannot absorb, and government banks cannot absorb 20% of the reserve funds. Now, by universally establishing simple savings offices with the reputation of the four banks, although it is a complex matter, the results will far exceed the level of only being able to transfer and absorb 20%. As for national savings bonds for saving the nation, whether they are type A or type B, they are all time-bound, with the shortest deposit period being six months. This is convenient for those who prefer time deposits, but inconvenient for those who only want demand deposits. Now, simple savings offices use a 5% annual interest rate to attract demand deposits. Depositors enjoy preferential interest, the convenience of depositing and withdrawing at any time, and the guarantee of capital security. The simple savings offices do not operate their private silver vaults, and as a result, they will be able to concentrate funds on a large scale and exert the three major effects discussed earlier.</p>
<p>Therefore, the widespread establishment of simple savings offices by the four banks is indeed the expansion of the national savings network. It is hoped that it can be established quickly in various places to adapt to the great development of the national savings movement for saving the nation personally led by Generalissimo Chiang.</p>
<p>Is Zha Chi Specializing in Futures?</p>
<p>Yesterday's newspaper published a news item stating that Zha Chi's trading is limited to spot goods. Although there is also buying and selling short, all are prepared with real goods. Recently, due to the abundance of floating capital in this port, the wealthy and general merchants are all buying gold for storage, and some are secretly buying large amounts, leading to a shortage of funds. The industry cannot close positions, and the market authorities will reform and plan to specialize in futures, with settlement at maturity.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Gold Standard Market was suspended after the war, and general brokers formed the Zha Chi trading market in a certain bank. In the past, the market price of Zha Chi fluctuated with foreign exchange, so since the black market of foreign exchange has seen repeated ups and downs, the market price of Zha Chi has also seen high prices, with a record high of 7,200. However, during that time, because the pound price fell in the European war, although foreign exchange was controlled, the free pound price in the New York market was difficult to stabilize. As a result, the fluctuations of Zha Chi turned to depend on the fluctuations of the US dollar.</p>
<p>However, although it has generally followed the US dollar this week, due to the short squeeze, the fluctuations of Zha Chi are no longer restricted by the US dollar. The degree of its rise and fall no longer coincides with the US dollar. For example, this week, the closing price of the US dollar in the foreign exchange market increased from 5.78125 to 5.84375, while Zha Chi increased from 5,658 yuan to 5,830 yuan.</p>
<p>The reason for this short squeeze is that the situation in the Far East is becoming increasingly dangerous, and foreign exchange is being held long. Those who generally preserve US dollars believe that if the United States and Japan have a war in the Pacific, the US dollar will inevitably fall in price. Therefore, storing gold is a great way to preserve wealth. However, read the announcement issued by the joint office of the four banks: "Some say that buying and storing gold bars is the most reliable because it is real goods. However, it is not known that gold has long been nationalized. The environment in Shanghai is special, and government laws and regulations cannot be implemented in time, so a black market for gold has emerged, and the value is soaring... In the future, when the war of resistance is completed, even if the government does not confiscate it, it will collect it at the legal price, and those who buy and store it will suffer a great loss." Therefore, those who buy gold in Shanghai today and think that storing gold is a great way to preserve wealth are truly mistaken.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Trading Is Quiet</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend was stable, and trading was quiet. The spot price of No. 24 raw white sugar at the outer warehouse was 74.2 yuan, and the price of transshipment goods was 59 yuan, both slightly lower. The price of Taikoo refined white sugar DY mark was slightly soft, 68.7 yuan at the east warehouse, slightly lower, and 69.1 yuan at the west warehouse. The spot price of Dutch red sugar continued to soften, at 56.35 yuan, slightly lower.</p>
<h3>Charcoal Sales Are Limited, Shortage of Wen Charcoal Is Not Important</h3>
<p>Although the source of charcoal is hopeless because the Hana round ship on the Shanghai-Wenzhou line was forced to turn back, charcoal merchants are taking this opportunity to raise prices. Wenzhou grade A charcoal is already shouting for 18 yuan per bundle. However, the spot goods are exhausted, and drawing cakes to satisfy hunger is in vain. Other charcoals, such as Haimen flat-cap charcoal, are sold for 15 yuan per load, and small basket Huangyan charcoal also requires about 13 yuan. Although there are some spot goods on the market, they are also collected at high prices by large households and concentrated for hoarding. In fact, since the manufacture of briquettes as fuel, the sales of charcoal are limited to households for cooking and kindling fire. The market is limited, so the shortage is not a problem for people's livelihood. However, most of the firewood and charcoal shops in this street have no goods to sell. Only a few who have stocks in storage live as rare goods, and some even sell for 5 jiao per catty, asking for prices from the sky, which is astonishing.</p>

<h3>Maintaining the Status Quo in the South Pacific, the United States Has the Determination to Aid China, the Evacuation of Overseas Chinese Proves This Fact, the United States Was Deceived by Japan's Temperance, and in Europe, it Is Extremely Helpful to Britain</h3>
<p>A certain American observer in this port had a long conversation with a visitor yesterday about the international situation. According to him, the current policy of the United States is to actively assist Britain in Europe and actively assist China in Asia. President Roosevelt recently gave a speech stating that the United States has decided to continue its assistance to Britain, because the country's heroic war prevents aggressors from approaching the American coast. It is true that Britain's decision to fight against Germany is not only to defend Britain's own interests.</p>
<p>The United States Will Deliver Flying Fortresses</p>
<p>According to the gentleman, British mainland and colonial arsenals are now rushing to build various new types of tanks, automatic cannons, light anti-aircraft guns, flat-shooting guns, and tractors. It is expected that Britain will have the upper hand in future battles. As for the news in the New York Herald that the United States has delivered 36 "Flying Fortresses" to Britain, although the British War Office has not explicitly admitted it, according to the observer, there is a great possibility.</p>
<p>Evacuation of Overseas Chinese Indicates Determination to Aid China</p>
<p>As for the Far East, the United States not only has the determination to aid China, but also has a major determination to maintain the status quo in the South Pacific. This can be proved by the US government's active evacuation of overseas Chinese. The US government's evacuation of overseas Chinese in the Far East has not been suspended due to Japan's temporary moderation. The Americans know Japan's diplomatic skills very well. When the general situation is favorable to Japan, they will become tough again.</p>
<p>Not Deceived, Expanding the Embargo</p>
<p>Recently, Japanese spokespersons have repeatedly explained that the Tripartite Pact is not aimed at the United States, but to ease the general anti-Japanese sentiment of the American people. Now, the US authorities have clearly stated that they will not be deceived and will plan to expand the scope of the embargo and impose economic sanctions on Japan. On the other hand, they are considering huge loans to China and, if necessary, sending aircraft to China to protect the reopened Yunnan-Burma Road. All these measures will slightly adjust and stabilize the world order.</p>
<p>American Overseas Chinese in Pingjin Prepare to Come to Shanghai</p>
<p>Since Pingjin was occupied by the Japanese army, American commercial firms have been squeezed out and cannot stand. Even the Mobil Oil Company, which used to be very prosperous, has seen its business exceptionally depressed due to the Japanese merchants' seizure of the market for kerosene. Japan is not an oil-producing country. Japanese oil is purchased from the United States, Iran, the Dutch East Indies, Mexico, and other places. It is purchased and transported to China by the Japanese and is completely monopolized. The profits of American merchants are seized by the Japanese, and the people in the interior are also exploited by the monopoly. In recent months, Japanese oil has accounted for two-thirds of the imported kerosene in North China, while companies such as Mobil, Asiatic, and Texaco account for only one-third. It is said that the monopoly system in North China has also been extended to Central China. The Tianjin Mobil Oil Company has decided to close down due to business difficulties and the current situation. Chinese employees have been dismissed, and American employees are also preparing to leave Tianjin for Shanghai and take a boat back home. As for the American commercial banks in Pingjin, due to the unstable local situation and unstable currency, deposits have increased and business is still good. The Citibank in the British Concession of Tianjin, which is the leading foreign bank in Tianjin, is said to be preparing to close down.</p>
<p>Evacuation Ships Continuously Sail West</p>
<p>Yesterday, according to news from the American overseas Chinese, the ships sent by the US government to the Far East to carry back evacuated overseas Chinese are now continuously sailing west. The Washington has already set sail the day before yesterday, and the Montclair also sailed from Los Angeles on the 16th and will arrive in Yokohama on the 29th. 425 American overseas Chinese in this port have decided to take the ship back to their country. It is also said that the ship may go to Qinhuangdao to pick up the American overseas Chinese there. The Mariposa is scheduled to depart from Honolulu on the 30th of this month and will also arrive in Shanghai on the 9th of next month.</p>
<p>All Four American Mail Ships Are Fully Booked</p>
<p>Currently, the passenger seats on the scheduled President ships of the American Mail Steamship Company in this port to the United States are fully booked. These four scheduled American mail ships are: (1) the President Pierce, which will depart on the 31st of this month; (2) the President Harrison, which will depart on the 3rd of next month; (3) the President Coolidge, which will depart next month; and (4) the President Garfield, which will depart in the middle of next month. Although the above four mail ships are fully booked.</p>
<h3>Taking Action Against Illegal Activities of Industrial and Commercial Groups, Two Ministries Approve Punishment Measures</h3>
<p>Since the winter of the 26th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1937], many employees of industrial and commercial groups have understood the righteousness and worked hard for the war of resistance, but there are also some who abuse the name of the group and engage in illegal activities. Now, the National Government has approved three draft measures for punishing illegal activities of employees of industrial and commercial groups. These measures have been slightly revised by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and have been reviewed by the Central Social Affairs Ministry and found to be no different. They have been promulgated to the provincial governments and ordered to inform their subordinates.</p>
<h3>Lin'an and Zhuji Are Recaptured One After Another</h3>
<p>Since the Japanese army secretly crossed the Qiantang River last year, they have been entrenched in Xiaoshan. The troops who attempted to invade Linpu were blocked and repelled by the Chinese army, and there was no major deployment, so the battle situation was relatively stable. Unexpectedly, starting on the 11th of this month, the Japanese army suddenly moved in several directions. Lin'an and Zhuji were once lost, but were recovered after a fierce counterattack by the defending army. The Datong News Agency reporter recently investigated the situation from Zhejiang groups in Shanghai, as follows.</p>
<p>The Chinese army counterattacked the Japanese army in Xiaoshan County. On the 11th of this month, the Japanese army suddenly advanced from Puyang to Zhuji. The Japanese army along the Fuchun River also secretly crossed the river and infiltrated Tonglu, Xindeng, and Lin'an in several directions. On the 14th, Xindeng and Lin'an were lost. The commander-in-chief of the × Army Group of the Eastern War Zone personally led reinforcements to launch a fierce counterattack, and finally recovered Lin'an. The Japanese army invading Tonglu also burned civilian houses along the way and retreated.</p>
<p>The battle was fierce, but the Japanese army constantly reinforced from Xiaoshan to Zhuji and sent aircraft to cover the Japanese army's ground operations. The fighting was very intense. The battle spread from the northwest of Zhuji to the suburbs. On the afternoon of the 17th, the Chinese army's reinforcements lost contact, and the county seat was finally lost. At that time, the troops that had recovered Lin'an had already crossed the river and arrived, and the elite troops in the rear also arrived one after another, so they surrounded Zhuji City on three sides, west, south, and north, and attacked fiercely. The Japanese army could not hold on and broke through on the dawn of the 18th. The Chinese army recovered Zhuji County on the morning of the 19th.</p>
<p>The Japanese bombed Zhejiang Province. Zhejiang groups in Shanghai received the following telegram from eastern Zhejiang: (1) At 3:24 PM on the 19th, a Japanese ship sailing from the northwest in the Chuanshan waters fired five shells at Jintang Mountain. The shells fell on the sandy beach and there was no loss to the Chinese side. It then sailed east. (2) At 3:25 PM on the 19th, a Japanese ship sailing from the north in the Shipu waters fired two shells at the Shipu coast. After firing the shells, the ship and the previously anchored Japanese ship left to the north. (3) On the 19th, it was drizzling and foggy in Ningbo, and the weather was bad. Japanese aircraft disappeared and did not dare to move. Also, yesterday (20th) at 9:30 AM, although it was also drizzling and foggy, the air pressure was higher. A Japanese aircraft invaded Fengqiao from Zhuji and dropped four bombs. The bombs fell in the wilderness and there was no loss. After the Japanese aircraft ravaged, it fled to the southwest. Ningbo did not issue an alarm.</p>
<h3>Pingmei Increased Prices</h3>
<p>It is learned that the Kailuan Mining Bureau has notified the coal industry that it plans to increase the price of Pingmei by 20 yuan per ton. Therefore, the cooked water industry has prepared to file a protest and will appeal to the city Chamber of Commerce and other public organizations to uphold justice. It is hoped that the Kailuan Mining Bureau will consider the difficulties of the people and withdraw the agreement.</p>
<h3>The Shanghai-Ningbo Train Was Again Hit by a Chinese Army Landmine, Destroying Four Cars and Killing More Than Ten Japanese Soldiers, No Casualties Among Passengers Due to the Absence of Passenger Cars</h3>
<p>Recently, the Chinese army on the Shanghai-Ningbo and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines has become very active, taking advantage of the fact that the Japanese army has been almost completely withdrawn. The Shanghai-Ningbo line is the worst. Since the beginning of this month, there have been three incidents of overturned trains due to landmines. The Japanese army is extremely panicked. Unexpectedly, at about 1:00 AM yesterday morning, the track near Qishuyan in Changzhou was again laid with landmines by the Chinese army, causing an uptown train to overturn after hitting the landmine. According to investigations, a row of uptown freight cars drove from Shanghai to Nanjing at 11:00 PM the night before. Around 1:00 AM, when driving near Changzhou, to the east of Qishuyan and the west of Henglin, it hit a landmine planted by the Chinese army. The locomotive and three freight cars were destroyed on the spot, and the rest overturned. The driver and more than ten Japanese soldiers escorting the cars were killed. Fortunately, the train was not attached with passenger cars, so there were no passenger casualties. Traffic on the Shanghai-Ningbo road was interrupted, and the track was destroyed for more than a dozen feet. It has not yet been repaired. Yesterday morning, although the Shanghai-Ningbo train still operated as usual, it only drove to Henglin Station. Passengers had to get off the bus and walk to Qishuyan before changing buses to Ningbo. Passengers all felt apprehensive.</p>

<h3>Goods Transported Inland Along the Yunnan-Burma Road are Loaded onto Ships to Singapore, and Then Transferred to Rangoon for Unloading and Loading onto Trains</h3>
<p>The Zi Lin Report said that it was learned from reliable sources that after the reopening of the Yunnan-Burma Road, the first ship from Shanghai to Singapore would arrive at its destination. The second ship, Guonan (transliteration), is scheduled to set sail from Shanghai on Thursday. The ship carries thousands of tons of goods manufactured in Shanghai, which will also be transported inland along the Yunnan-Burma Road.</p>
<p>Investigating the Shipping Situation of Goods</p>
<p>According to information from the shipping industry, another ship, Shenguang (transliteration), which was originally scheduled to leave Shanghai for Singapore yesterday (the 19th), will be delayed for a few days. It is said that Shanghai transportation companies have sent representatives to Rangoon to investigate the transportation situation, so that goods manufactured in Shanghai can be transported to Sichuan and Yunnan.</p>
<p>Difficulty in Landing in Singapore</p>
<p>Datong News Agency said that passengers traveling from Shanghai to the interior by boat to Singapore need to have a passport, which must be approved by the British Consulate before they can buy a ticket. The procedure for signing the passport to enter Singapore is very complicated. The Consulate must investigate the guarantor of the passport applicant with the Singapore Immigration Bureau before it agrees to sign. It takes more than a month, and the signing fee is one pound and six pence. The procedure for signing a passport to Rangoon is simpler, and only a guarantee from a solid group shop is required. Therefore, for those who travel from Shanghai to Rangoon by boat and do not land in Singapore, the passport signing procedure is still convenient.</p>
<h3>The French Concession Replaces Rickshaw Puller Licenses</h3>
<p>From November 4th of this year, the public rickshaw puller licenses will be replaced at the Vehicle Office of the French Police Station at 28 Xuehuali Road. The office hours are from 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM every day except Sunday. Armbands will be issued. License holders can go to replace their licenses according to the following dates. License numbers 1 to 10,000, replacement dates November 4th to 9th, 10,001 to 20,000, November 11th to 16th, 20,001 to 30,000, November 18th to 23rd, 30,001 to 40,000, November 25th to 30th, December 2nd to 7th, is the period for delayed replacements. Those who are overdue will no longer be replaced, and all licenses that have not been replaced before December 7th of this year will be invalidated.</p>
<h3>British Sportsman Hunter Suddenly Dies on the Golf Course, Suddenly Falling to the Ground While Playing Golf, His Companions Rushed to See That He Had Already Died</h3>
<p>The Zi Lin Report said that a British sportsman in this city, Hunter, participated in the first day of the Chinese Amateur Golf Championship on the golf course in Sijingqiao yesterday (the 19th). His activities were as usual and there were no signs of illness. At 10:30 AM, when Mr. Hunter and his ball partner Kenmins were playing the fourth round, he suddenly fell to the ground and did not get up. Other participants rushed forward to see and help. Dr. Uhara was also among them. After examining Mr. Hunter, he had already died and there was no way to save him. Therefore, the body was carried into the golf course building, and the flag of the Shanghai Golf Association was lowered to half-mast in mourning. Mr. Hunter came to Shanghai 20 years ago and worked for Deji Foreign Company for many years. Later, he established Hunter Foreign Company, which operated wool goods and was also the deputy agent of the United Motorcycle Insurance Company. Mr. Hunter is survived by his wife and a daughter.</p>
<h3>Five Societies Jointly Discuss the Sutras: On the Precepts of Confucianism and Buddhism; Buddhist Scriptures and Treatises Speak of Four Items</h3>
<p>Last week, the Five Societies Jointly Discussed the Sutras held its second lecture. Among the guests were some who had not attended the previous one. The lecturers were Yang Zhongyi and Yao Taiping. Mr. Shen Daling had prepared a topic that was common to all five teachings, but because it was late, there was no time to discuss it. The main points of Mr. Yang's lecture are recorded below:</p>
<p>Six similarities between Confucianism and Buddhism: One of the Paramitas is Shila Paramita. Shila, in Chinese, means "holding precepts," which means being able to uphold the precepts without destroying them. It is the self-governing mind that observes rules and is not tainted by habits. Someone may ask, "Do Buddhists have precepts, and do Confucians also have precepts?" I say, "Yes, it is seen in the Analects 'The gentleman has three cautions' and the History of Yuan, Biography of Lian Xixian, 'Your subject has received the precepts of Confucius.'" Summarizing what the Buddhist scriptures and treatises say, there are four definite items:</p>
<p>The Categories of Precepts Received</p>
<p>The Great Expansive Buddha Repaying Kindness Sutra says, "Precepts have superior, middle, and inferior categories. The Five Precepts are the inferior category, the Ten Precepts are the middle category, and the Complete Precepts are the superior category." The Five Precepts are: not killing, not stealing, not engaging in sexual misconduct, not lying, and not drinking alcohol. "The gentleman keeps away from the kitchen" is the heart of not killing. "Not taking what is unrighteous" is cultivating the heart of not stealing. "Thinking no evil" is cultivating the heart of not engaging in sexual misconduct. "Speaking with trustworthiness" is cultivating the heart of not lying. "Yu banished Yi Di, and Wei Wu made the alcohol prohibition" is cultivating the heart of not drinking alcohol. The Ten Precepts, in addition to the Five Precepts, add not wearing garlands, fine fragrances, or smearing the body with them, which means not wearing extravagant clothes, and those who hold this precept dare not be coquettish. Not singing, dancing, or acting, nor going to watch or listen, which means engaging in wicked and荒亡 (wasteful) acts, and those who hold this precept dare not go on pleasure trips. Not sitting on high, wide, and large beds, which means being disrespectful and lazy, and those who hold this precept dare not be at ease. Not eating at improper times, so as to restrain the desires of the mouth and stomach. Not grasping or treading on gold, silver, or precious objects, so as to cherish the use of wealth. A scholar who is devoted to the Dao but is ashamed of wearing bad clothes and eating bad food is not worth discussing. Confucius did not criticize Yu for wearing coarse clothes and eating poor food. He praised Yu for wearing a worn-out cotton robe without shame. The chapter on "The Village Party" records the Sage's clothing, food, dwelling, and travels in great detail, and it is truly a model for scholars. The Complete Precepts are 250 precepts for monks and 500 precepts for nuns, actually 348 precepts. The Eight Schools Outline says, "When receiving the Complete Precepts, one obtains such boundless precepts, which are as vast as space and encompass the entire Dharma realm, all perfectly complete, hence the name Complete Precepts." Why are there as many as 500 Complete Precepts? It is said that the Five Precepts are not too few, and the Five Hundred Precepts are not too many. Can the word "forgiveness" be practiced for a lifetime? The word "forgiveness" can be practiced for a lifetime without exhausting it, so it is not too few. The three hundred rules of etiquette and the three thousand rules of deportment are not too many.</p>
<p>The Fruits Obtained</p>
<p>The Buddhist Kindness Sutra also says, "Among the Five Precepts, there are also three categories. If one receives the precepts with an inferior mind, one obtains the inferior category of precepts. If one receives the precepts with a middle mind, one obtains the middle category of precepts. If one receives the precepts with a superior mind, one obtains the superior category of precepts. The Ten Precepts and the Complete Precepts also each have three categories, as said of the Five Precepts. If one obtains the Five Precepts with a superior mind, they are the superior category of precepts. If one obtains the Ten Precepts with a middle mind, they are the middle category of precepts. If one obtains the Complete Precepts with an inferior mind, they are the inferior category of precepts. Therefore, depending on the mind, there are superior, middle, and inferior categories, and the precepts obtained are different, without a fixed limit." Receiving precepts in form is not as good as receiving precepts in mind. Receiving precepts in form can be seen and heard. Receiving precepts in mind is seeing in the formless and hearing in the soundless. The Doctrine of the Mean says, "Be cautious of what you do not see, and be fearful of what you do not hear." The Great Learning says, "What ten eyes see and what ten hands point to." "Therefore, the gentleman must be cautious when he is alone." The caution of the Doctrine of the Mean and the Great Learning is receiving precepts in the mind.</p>
<p>The Treatise on the Perfection of Wisdom says, "Those who uphold precepts in an inferior way are born in the human realm. Those who uphold precepts in a middle way are born in the six desire heavens. Those who uphold precepts and also practice the four dhyanas and the four formless trances are born in the form and formless realms. Those who uphold precepts in a superior way have three types. Those who uphold precepts purely in an inferior way attain Arhatship. Those who uphold precepts purely in a middle way attain Pratyekabuddhahood. Those who uphold precepts purely in a superior way attain Buddhahood." According to this, those who uphold precepts in an inferior way are still reborn in the human realm, and they are fortunate enough not to fall into the three evil paths. Those who uphold precepts in a middle way are born in the six desire heavens, which means escaping the human realm and ascending to heaven. The desire realm has six heavens: (1) the Heaven of the Four Heavenly Kings, (2) the Heaven of the Thirty-three, (3) the Yama Heaven, (4) the Tushita Heaven, (5) the Nirmanarati Heaven, and (6) the Paranirmita-vasavartin Heaven. Of these six heavens, the Heaven of the Thirty-three and below are called earth-dwelling heavens, and the Tushita Heaven and above are called air-dwelling heavens. If one upholds precepts and also practices the four dhyanas, one escapes the desire realm and is born in the form realm heavens. If one also practices the formless trances, one transcends the form realm and is born in the formless realm heavens, which are divided into four levels: (1) the Plane of Infinite Space, (2) the Plane of Infinite Consciousness, (3) the Plane of No-thingness, and (4) the Plane of Neither Perception nor Non-perception. Those who uphold precepts in a middle way can transcend the human realm but cannot transcend the three realms, so their ultimate attainment lies in upholding precepts in a superior way. Among those who uphold precepts purely in a superior way, those who uphold precepts in an inferior way attain the fourth Arhatship. Those who uphold precepts purely in a middle way attain Pratyekabuddhahood, which is also called a Self-Realized One. Only those who uphold precepts purely in a superior way can attain the ultimate supreme vehicle, the Buddha's path of the Bodhisattva. This is because the categories of precepts received are different, and the fruits obtained are thus different.</p>
<p>The Analects records that Confucius's answers to Yan Yuan, Zhong Gong, Sima Niu, and Fan Chi when they asked about ren (benevolence) were different. It also records that Confucius's answers to Meng Yizi, Meng Wubo, Ziyou, and Zixia when they asked about filial piety were different. When Zigong asked about the qualities of a shi (gentleman), Confucius first told him to act with a sense of shame and to fulfill his mission without disgrace. When asked about the next level, he said, "The clan praises him for being filial, and the village praises him for being fraternal." When asked about the next level, he said, "He is trustworthy in his words and decisive in his actions. He is a stubborn and petty man, but he can still be considered next in line." This is because the categories of precepts received are different, and the fruits obtained are thus superior or inferior. Therefore, Mencius, in his discussion of Le Zhengzi's determining what is beneath the center, says, "What is desirable is called good. Having it within oneself is called trustworthiness. Filling it up is called beauty. Filling it up and having radiance is called greatness. Being great and transforming it is called sageliness. Being sagely and unknowable is called divinity." Although they are all sages, Boyi is the pure sage, Yi Yin is the responsible sage, Liu Xiahui is the harmonious sage, and Confucius is the timely sage.</p>
<p>The Precepts Held</p>
<p>The Brahma Net Sutra, Mind-Ground Chapter, says, "The Buddha told all the Buddha-sons, 'There are ten heavy Pratimokshas. If one receives the Bodhisattva precepts but does not recite these precepts, he is not a Bodhisattva and not a Buddha-seed.'" Pratimoksha in Chinese means liberation, which means liberation in all places or following liberation. The precepts received by the seven assemblies liberate the seven branches of the body and mouth from evil. The seven branches are the three of the body and the four of the mouth, which are the seven branches of karma. It also says, "The Buddha told the Buddha-sons, 'If one commits suicide, teaches others to kill, facilitates killing, praises killing, casually agrees to killing, or even uses spells to kill, causes of killing, conditions of killing, methods of killing, or karma of killing, even all beings with life, one must not intentionally kill them.'" The same applies to stealing, sexual misconduct, lying, harsh speech, and divisive speech, hence the name Ten Heavy Pratimokshas. It also says, "Bodhisattvas should have a compassionate heart to protect and rescue, but if they kill willfully, it is a Parajika offense." Parajika means "severing the head," which means there is no possibility of repentance. Therefore, a Bodhisattva's compassion lies in protecting good people and not shielding evil people. If one breaks the precepts and commits evil to the point of being beyond repentance, even a Bodhisattva cannot forcibly indulge them. This is why one incurs guilt from Heaven and has nowhere to pray. When one incurs guilt to the point of having nowhere to pray, even the sages can do nothing about it but have compassion and not rejoice.</p>
<p>The Items Prohibited</p>
<p>The Sutra of Forty-two Sections Spoken by the Buddha says, "The Buddha said, 'Sentient beings consider ten things to be good and ten things to be evil. What are the ten? The three of the body, the four of the mouth, and the three of the mind. The three of the body are killing, stealing, and sexual misconduct. The four of the mouth are divisive speech, harsh speech, lying, and frivolous speech. The three of the mind are jealousy, anger, and delusion. These ten things are not in accordance with the holy path and are called the ten evil deeds. If these evils are stopped, they are each the ten good deeds.'" The Thus Come One's teachings are nothing more than wanting people to turn from evil and do good, holding these precepts of the three karmas of body, mouth, and mind.</p>
<p>The body is the practice of ordinary virtue, the mouth is the caution of ordinary speech, and the mind is introspection without guilt. Speech and action are the pivot of a gentleman. The Great Dai Ritual says, "Speech does not go far away." The body is the master of speech. Action does not go far from the body, which is the root of action. Therefore, the four subjects of virtue, conduct, speech, and language in the sage's gate are valued above politics and literature. This emphasizes that speech and action must be verifiable.</p>
<p>Mr. Yao's lecture on the Classic of Filial Piety covered "The root of the people is exhausted in life, and the meaning of death and life is fully prepared" in great detail, moving the listeners. Then, he spoke of the similarities of the five teachings in the meaning of death and life.</p>
<h3>The Central Trust Bureau Organizes Insurance for Inventory in Stores Against Military Disasters; The Total Amount for Each Store is Limited to 5,000 Yuan; Each Store Must Report Inventory After Business Hours Every Day</h3>
<p>After the Central Trust Bureau was ordered to organize military disaster insurance, the military disaster insurance policies issued have reached 86.5 million yuan, of which transportation insurance accounts for 60 million yuan, and the rest are bombing insurance, etc. The insurance premiums charged are lower than any foreign military disaster insurance. The insurance premium does not exceed 1% of the total amount of insurance. Special discounts are also given to long-term insurance and industrial insurance related to construction. Recently, the bureau has handled the method of individual insurance for inventory in business stores during extraordinary times: (1) Stores approved for insurance by the Social Bureau may also insure their inventory at the same time, but the total amount for each store shall not exceed 5,000 yuan. (2) Each store shall fill out three copies of the daily inventory report after business hours. In addition to keeping one copy for their own record, the other two copies shall be delivered to the trade association and the Social Bureau before 8:00 a.m. the next day. (3) The figures filled in the daily inventory report must be consistent with the actual situation and shall not be falsely reported. (4) All books and documents related to the quantity of goods must be properly preserved for verification at any time.</p>
<h3>Various Banks Strive to Shift Fluid Capital Inland; The Exact Number Cannot Be Investigated, But the Results Are Already Evident</h3>
<p>Although there is no definite figure to investigate how much fluid capital has flowed into the interior from Shanghai, it is estimated that the total amount of investment in Chongqing and other inland areas by the Shanghai banking community and its customers is no less than 150 million yuan. In the first half of this year, another 100 million yuan flowed into the interior, most of which was remitted by private businesses and individuals to develop enterprises. This point is indeed impressive. The outflow of fluid capital from Shanghai to the interior is generally agreed upon because, on the one hand, it can enable funds to be used properly and develop the southwest, and on the other hand, it can reduce the speculative trend in Shanghai. Shanghai speculators often create trouble in the market, with the exchange market and important stores as their speculative targets, which is very harmful to society. The transfer of Shanghai funds to the interior is the result of the joint efforts of the four banks of China, Central, Communications, and Agriculture, together with various commercial banks. In the future, if the government rewards the successful transfer of funds to the interior, wartime finance and economic construction will naturally become more optimistic.</p>
<h3>Settlement of Un-dispatched Refugees; Arrangement Methods; Continued Care; Shared Responsibility</h3>
<p>The Refugee Relief Association issued a public notice yesterday stating that the association has been working with various charitable organizations to carry out relief work for two years. After repeated meetings of the board of directors, all Chinese and foreign directors unanimously decided to divide the refugees in the reception centers into four categories: the elderly, disabled, orphans, women, children, and school-age refugee children, and continue to provide care for them separately. Those who are adults and able to support themselves will be transferred to the dispatch center, and each person will be given funds and dispatched step by step, etc. This proposal was agreed upon unanimously after convening a meeting of various charitable organizations. It is now found that the total number of refugees in the reception centers is still more than 16,000, and the refugees who should continue to receive care account for three-quarters of the total. Four centers, "Elderly, Disabled, Women, Children, Orphans, and Refugee Children," have been established, and the Cilian General Association, the Cilian Branch Association, and this association are responsible for them respectively. They have been handed over to the sub-committee for implementation and adjusted according to the above methods. For the sake of the long-term safety of the refugees who cannot support themselves, the purpose of relief is to be thoroughly implemented. We are sincerely afraid that there are rumors outside that all the reception centers have been disbanded due to a lack of understanding of the truth, so we have truthfully narrated the association's decision-making methods as above to avoid misunderstandings. However, after this, the time for caring for the refugees who remain will be longer, and the cost will be higher. The responsibility of this association and various charitable organizations will be heavier. Although the number of people has decreased, even if we take the item of rice as an example, it has increased more than four times, and a large amount of funding is still needed to maintain it. We deeply hope that all people in Shanghai will continue to support the relief effort with the same spirit as in the past so that the relief work can be carried out from beginning to end. We cannot help but offer our most sincere prayers and hereby issue this public notice.</p>
<h3>Unseasonal Weather; High Fever Epidemic</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of autumn in this city, the weather has been cool, and the seasonal epidemics have gradually subsided. However, recently, due to the unseasonal weather, influenza and another type of high fever, one of Shanghai's diseases, are extremely prevalent. Many hospitals in the two concessions have admitted many patients. The health department is now paying attention to it and hopes that residents will take proper precautions.</p>

<h3>Case of Mother and Daughter Eloping; Paramour Accuses of Theft; Old Paramour Steals from Daughter and Paramour Runs Away; Also Sends Letter to Bank Prohibiting Reporting Loss</h3>
<p>Yang Haifeng, a native of Shandong who resides at 434 Jiujiang Road and runs the Haifeng Plaster Shop, had a case of his wife and daughter eloping a few days ago. The newspapers have reported on the matter in detail. It is now learned that the mother and daughter are Yang Haifeng's paramour and stepdaughter. Yang began cohabitating with a woman named Zang twelve years ago. At that time, the paramour brought her stepdaughter, Zang Mingfeng, who was only six years old. In the past twelve years, Yang not only treated the paramour</p>
<p>As if she were his wife,</p>
<p>But also regarded the stepdaughter as his own, cherishing her as the apple of his eye. Zang Jinfeng is now twenty-nine years old and has fallen in love with a certain young man. Yang often advised Jinfeng with words to guard against gigolos. However, Jinfeng actually eloped on the morning of the ninth of last month. The woman surnamed Zang, although she had lived with Yang for twelve years, was just a temporary partner. Therefore, while Yang was sound asleep, she took the passbooks, seals, dozens of silk and satin clothes, many gold ornaments, and hundreds of yuan in cash from Yang's deposits in various banks.</p>
<p>All of which were taken away</p>
<p>And eloped tracelessly with her biological daughter, Zang Jinfeng. Yang urgently commissioned lawyer Zhang Danping to file a complaint with the First Court, accusing the paramour and stepdaughter of colluding to steal. The Zang Jinfeng mother and daughter did not appear in court, and they even sent a letter to the Bank of Communications requesting a prohibition on reporting the loss. Yang was even more infuriated that his paramour had stolen his deposits, covered them with seals, and prohibited reporting the loss. Now, the father has commissioned lawyer Zhang to file a lawsuit in the Civil Court to confirm the loss.</p>
<h3>Owner of Underwear Company Flees After Defrauding Goods; Court Discusses Issuing Arrest Warrant</h3>
<p>Xue Fengxiang, a local Shanghai resident, is sixty years old and lives at 77 Hengmao Lane, Min Ti Ni Yin Road. Recently, he hired lawyer Fang Junjie to file a complaint with the Second Criminal Division of the Special Court, accusing Mo Baiqing of fraud under Article 339 of the Criminal Law. His complaint stated that the defendant is the owner of the Meiguang Underwear Company on Caizhong Road. From the 20th of last month, he went to the Wuzhou Wool Fabric Factory and the Luye Cosmetics Company, which were opened by the plaintiff, to</p>
<p>Purchase towels</p>
<p>One hundred and fifty dozen, worth 885 yuan, and twenty-three dozen of cosmetics worth 221 yuan and 40 cents. The defendant instructed them to be packed in two batches and delivered to Room 24, 3rd Floor, Taian Trading House, Zhubaosan Road. The plaintiff complied and ordered people to deliver the purchased goods to the address that day. After the goods were inspected and accepted by the defendant, he paid with a</p>
<p>Check</p>
<p>From the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, dated September 21, for 900 yuan in national currency. He also said that he was short 140 yuan and asked them to come back the next day to collect the balance. The plaintiff believed him and transferred the check to the Ankang Money Exchange in Xingren Lane, Henan Road, the next day. The money exchange went to the</p>
<p>Bank to cash it, but it was rejected due to insufficient funds. The original check was returned. The plaintiff was shocked and horrified when he heard the news. He immediately went to the defendant's factory to negotiate, but he did not expect to find that the factory had already closed down and the defendant had also</p>
<p>Fled far away</p>
<p>In this situation, the defendant had the intention to defraud goods by fraud. Please, Your Honor, punish him with the crime he deserves. The court, based on the complaint, opened the Second Criminal Division for trial by Judge Tang yesterday morning. The defendant did not appear in court after being summoned. The court immediately ordered the issuance of an arrest warrant and adjourned the hearing indefinitely.</p>
<h3>Peddler of Old Bottles Narrowly Escapes Kidnapping; Two Kidnappers Arrested on the Spot</h3>
<p>Shi Tiannai, a native of Huzhou, is thirty-one years old and currently resides on the third floor of the Zhang Dexing Board Box Shop opposite the Dahua Hotel on Zhili Road. He owns a small property in his hometown. After the war broke out and the countryside was occupied, he came to Shanghai with his fellow villager Shen Yilin (fifty-three years old, residing at No. 8, Lane 173, Tangjia Lane, engaged in the used goods business). Shi rented a place to live and made a living by collecting old glass bottles. However, Shen recently learned that Shi had some savings and suddenly had evil intentions. He colluded with his fellow villager Shi Zhangdu (twenty-eight years old, residing at No. 190, Laian Lane, Xinmin Road) and invited a certain foreigner to go to Shi's residence at 7:20 yesterday morning to threaten Shi and drag him to Beijing Road, intending to kidnap him onto a rickshaw. However, at that time, all the rickshaw pullers refused. Shen and Shi then forcibly dragged Shi to the southern end of the Zhabei Bridge on Fujian Road when they were spotted by a Chinese constable from No. 79, who stopped them from proceeding. The foreigner took the opportunity to escape north, while Shen and Shi were arrested and taken to the Zhabei Police Station along with Shi Tiannai for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Owner of Zhengxiang Trading Company Accused of Breach of Trust and Embezzlement; Court Orders Bail and Further Verification</h3>
<p>Zhang Xiangqing of Zhengxiang Trading Company, No. 25 Zhubaosan Road, was entrusted by Yu Debao (local Shanghainese, twenty-eight years old) in November of the 27th year to build five residences on Amoy Road and add a small house inside the residence on Gaoteng Road. After the completion in September of the 28th year, Yu discovered that there was a suspicion of forgery and alteration of accounts, so he asked accountant Li Wenjie to check the accounts. It was found that Zhang did have many dishonest points. Yu then commissioned lawyer Lan Xuzhang to file a complaint with the Second Criminal Division of the Special Court, accusing Zhang Xiangqing of breach of trust and forgery. The court, based on the complaint, opened the Second Criminal Division for trial by Judge Li on the afternoon of the 17th. After interrogating the defendant and inquiring in detail about the witness Zou Guozhu, it was confirmed that there was indeed alteration of accounts and other circumstances. He was ordered to post bail of 1,000 yuan and reschedule the trial.</p>

<h3>Improved Treatment for Paint Workers Resolved; Labor and Management Agreed on Methods; Implementation on November 11</h3>
<p>There are about four or five thousand paint workers in this city. Recently, due to the increasing cost of living, the union representatives have requested the employers to increase wages and food allowances to maintain their livelihoods. On the 28th of last month, representatives of the paint workers' union and the trade association conducted negotiations on the sixth floor of the Pudong Fellow Villagers Association. The employers also expressed sympathy for the workers' difficult lives at this time. After two meetings, representatives of both sides agreed on the afternoon of the 19th to increase the wage by 50 cents per worker, that is, the wage per worker is 1 yuan and 25 cents, and the food allowance per worker is 1 yuan and 25 cents, for a total of 2 yuan and 50 cents per worker.

<h3>Strict Alert by Japanese Soldiers in West Shanghai; Tense Situation; Increased Posts, Arrangement of Barbed Wire; Mobile Searches of Pedestrians and Vehicles</h3>
<p>Since Warrant Officer Sato Seiichi of the Japanese military police platoon in West Shanghai was shot and killed near Qianjia Lane, Pingyuan Road on the afternoon of the 18th, the Japanese soldiers have immediately implemented emergency alert measures in the vicinity, and the situation is tense. According to a reporter from Daguan News Agency who drove to inspect yesterday, armed Japanese military police and "municipal police" patrolled back and forth on foot or by motorcycle on the sections of the outer boundary roads Yuyuan Road, Jessfield Road, and Connaught Road, frequently throughout the day. There were also five or six Japanese officers and soldiers taking turns checking pedestrians and vehicles at the corner of Dibang Road and Eddington Road, Jessfield Road, and Kangjiaqiao. The No. 1 Road bus and the No. 20 tram passing through the area were also stopped several times. The Japanese military police headquarters on Jessfield Road, the Benham Road detachment, and the gate of the Xihu Police Station at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII were all heavily guarded by armed sentries and placed with barbed wire obstacles. All vehicles and pedestrians deemed suspicious were forced to stop and subjected to harsh inspections.</p>
<h3>French Company Water and Electricity Workers' Strike; No Negotiations Yesterday; Both Sides Will Continue to Negotiate; Restore Traffic at Any Time</h3>
<p>Since the French Tram Company went on strike on the 25th of last month, more than 20 days have passed. Initially, with the efforts and cooperation of the French authorities and the company, necessary traffic was still maintained as usual. Later, due to the addition of coppersmith workers to the strike, all traffic was completely suspended. However, since labor and management have held direct negotiations in the past few days, there is hope for a resumption of work. On the mornings and afternoons of the previous day, the company's manager, Favreau, and eight worker representatives, including four representatives from the vehicle department and a representative from the mechanical department, held two long direct negotiations. There are no longer any problems with increasing wages. The only thing that has not been settled is that the workers insist that all 45 dismissed workers must be reinstated. It is rumored that negotiations will continue yesterday morning, but this is not accurate. However, the negotiations between the two sides have not broken down and will continue to conduct direct negotiations to seek a solution. However, the time for the next negotiation has not been agreed upon. The company can wait for the worker representatives to come to negotiate at any time. As for the company's preparations for restoring traffic, they are making preparations every day.</p>
<h3>Swindling Jewelry and Ornaments; Japanese Swindler Caught; Many Cases; Finally Arrested by Police</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that for the past few weeks, a Japanese man in the central district of the Public Concession has repeatedly defrauded jewelry and fled without a trace. The Shanghai Municipal Police has been searching for the suspect vigorously. Just after noon yesterday (the 19th), the Japanese man went to the Huamao Jewelry Store on Jiangxi Road again to carry out his old tricks and was finally arrested by detectives from the Central Police Station. The method used by the suspect to swindle jewelry and other items is much the same. The targets of the swindle are mostly Chinese jewelry stores. He claims to represent a large Japanese trading company on the Bund and wants to purchase jewelry on behalf of the principal. The jewelry store owners do not suspect anything and take out exquisite ornaments for him to choose from. The Japanese man selects several items and asks the store owner to order someone to go to the office on the Bund to collect the money. After arriving at the office, the Japanese man asks the person collecting the money to wait outside while he goes to get the money. In reality, he takes the ornaments and seizes the opportunity to escape. For the past few weeks, the suspect has defrauded jewelry and ornaments worth no less than several thousand yuan. After receiving the report, the police dispatched detectives everywhere. Yesterday, when the suspect went to the Huamao Jewelry Store to try his old tricks, he was caught by the detectives who were tracking him. It is believed that the Japanese man previously committed many crimes in Hongkou before coming to the central district to swindle jewelry. He has finally been caught.</p>
<h3>Yan Liu Shi Comes to Shanghai from Peiping to Accuse Son-in-Law of Obstructing Morality; Ma Ziren Guilty of Adultery and Intimidation of Younger Sister-in-Law, Already Convicted, Case Re-Opened for Further Inquiry</h3>
<p>Ma Ziren, a graduate of Northeast University from Peiping, was instructed by his mother-in-law, Yan Liu Shi, two years ago in winter, to take travel expenses of seven hundred yuan and accompany her younger daughter Yan Jing (also known as Jingbo, 20 years old this year) to Kunming for studies. Unexpectedly, when Ma and Jing passed through Shanghai from their hometown, he raped Jingbo in the Hui Jin Hotel on Sanma Road. When the travel expenses ran out, Ma forced the girl to the</p>
<p>Great Eastern Ballroom</p>
<p>to work as a dance hostess.</p>
<p>Before long, Jingbo met a dancer from Ningbo, Chen Dingming (43 years old, residing at No. 25, Lane 42, Bei Di Aolong Road, employed at Leli Foreign Firm, No. 91 Beijing Road). A relationship developed from friendship. Chen then told the girl to quit dancing and they lived together at Chen's house. Ma also went along, but Ma secretly strongly opposed this matter. Chen paid 300 yuan and told Ma to leave Chen's house. Ma held a grudge and threatened Chen and Yan with a kitchen knife. Chen had no choice but to report to the police and have Ma detained and sent to the Second Branch of the Court, according to the</p>
<p>obstructing freedom</p>
<p>crime, sentenced to nine months in prison. Recently, Yan's mother, Yan Liu Shi (Ma Ziren's mother-in-law), came to Shanghai and, in her capacity as a legal representative, commissioned a lawyer to file a lawsuit with the First Special Court Criminal Division, accusing Ma of obstructing morality. The court approved the lawsuit. Yesterday, Judge Jiang issued an official letter to the authorities of the Second Special Prison, stating the cause of the case, and brought Ma Ziren up for trial. According to the plaintiff Yan Liu Shi's</p>
<p>Confession</p>
<p>Last winter, my daughter Jingbo's uncle sent a letter from Chongqing, instructing Jingbo to study in Chongqing. At that time, my eldest son-in-law (referring to the defendant Ma Ziren) voluntarily requested me and was willing to accompany my younger daughter to Chongqing, and swore to heaven that he had no ulterior motives. I thought he was my son-in-law and did not suspect anything else. I immediately raised 700 yuan for travel expenses and handed them to the defendant to accompany my daughter south. Who knew he was actually</p>
<p>A beast in human form</p>
<p>two-faced, destroyed my younger daughter's chastity, and forced her to work as a dance hostess. Therefore, I request the court to sentence the defendant to the punishment he deserves, etc. The court then cross-examined the defendant Ma Ziren, who confessed that because the plaintiff's eldest daughter did not abide by the way of women and ruined my reputation, I deliberately raped my younger sister-in-law in order to ruin the reputation of her Yan family ancestors. Judge Jiang examined the situation and ordered the defendant to be detained and await another hearing at a later date.</p>
<h3>Precautionary Measures in Both Concessions Continue</h3>
<p>According to the report of the Public Concession Police Department, since the precautionary measures were taken in the territory on August 9, the security achievements have improved day by day. The number of criminal cases occurring within the boundaries in the past week has been reduced to 417. As for the ordinary precautionary facilities within the boundaries, the authorities have not considered removing them at present, as they have been quite effective in maintaining security, and public transportation has not been hindered in any way. The French Concession has also continued to extend the measures indefinitely.</p>
<h3>After the Consecration of the Panchen Lama Statue, the Grandeur of the Thousand Lamps Ceremony; The Footprints of Esoteric Buddhist Images in Jiangnan Begin with the Panchen Lama Master</h3>
<p>The Panchen Lama statue consecrated in Jueyuan was cast solely by Rongzeng Kanbu. Its cost reached 30,000 gold due to the high price of copper. It is noted that before the war, the Shanghai Buddhist community cast a copper bell weighing 10,000 jin at Jiuhua Mountain, named Youming Bell, and hung it on the mountain. The casting of this Panchen Lama statue is a major event in the Buddhist community that shines before and after.</p>
<p>Ascending the Platform to Preach</p>
<p>Since the consecration of the Panchen Lama statue the day before yesterday, the Dharma Assembly was held as usual yesterday. Rongzeng Kanbu presided over the altar and preached, with ten lamps set up inside the altar, shining like stars. Buddhist celebrities Guan Jiongzhi, Huang Hanzhi, Wen Lanting, Zhao Yunshao, Shen Binhan, Zhao Puchu, etc., all personally attended the altar to take care of the ceremony. Hundreds of Buddhist men and women listened to Rongzeng's preaching. The altar was packed.</p>
<p>Footprints in Jiangnan</p>
<p>This Thousand Lamps Offering Dharma Assembly must be held continuously for ten days before the altar is removed. The Panchen Lama statue will be temporarily placed in Jueyuan, and then sent to Putuo Mountain in the future when the situation is peaceful, to build temples for worship. The footprints of esoteric Buddhist images in southern China begin with the Panchen Lama statue, which is a unique highlight in the history of Jiangnan Buddhism.</p>
<h3>Registration of Trademarks for Domestic Goods; No More Delays or Evasions</h3>
<p>Previously, in order to prevent privately produced goods from changing their appearance, being sold in the interior, and disrupting the wartime financial foundation, there were strict measures for the registration and certification of goods from various countries. However, over time, the regulations have been played with. A relevant authority has submitted a petition to the Ministry of Economy, suggesting that trademarks for all domestic goods must be registered with the Ministry of Economy. The Ministry of Economy has replied to the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, stating that merchants have the freedom and sovereignty to register trademarks for goods and cannot be forced to do so. However, for the sake of their own interests and business reputation, merchants will also be happy to register and will never want to bring trouble on themselves. It is hoped that all domestic goods organizations will be notified to instruct their employees, factories, and shops to voluntarily register with the Ministry of Economy, no longer delay the registration of trademarks, eliminate the flow of privately produced goods into the interior, and strengthen the wartime economic foundation.</p>
<h3>Machine-Made Noodles; Revised Price; Thirty-Six Cents Per Jin; Implemented from Tomorrow</h3>
<p>All members of the Shanghai Machine-Made Noodle Industry Association have been repeatedly subjected to panic over flour. They have been operating reluctantly with the efforts of the concession authorities to mediate. This time, they have resumed negotiations with the flour mills and agreed to supply 2,030 bags per day at a limited price of 16.5 yuan per bag, plus a handling fee of 0.3 yuan. Compared with the current market price of cut noodles, the losses are quite large. Therefore, with the consent of the concession authorities, from the 22nd of this month, the retail price of cut noodles will be changed to 36 cents per jin. All businesses must not exceed the limit.</p>
<h3>Puji Hospital Opens</h3>
<p>Shanghai silk tycoons Zhu Jing'an and Shen Huachen, etc., founded Puji Hospital at No. 38, intersection of Route Doumer and Rue Lupan in the French Concession, with the aim of serving the society and providing universal relief from illness. Free clinics and medicine are provided daily from 8:00 am to 10:00 am, which is charitable in nature. Dr. Li Shusheng is in charge, and it opened a few days ago.</p>
<h3>Weather Report</h3>
<p>The Xuhui Observatory announced yesterday at 4:30 pm that the weather in Shandong is partly cloudy. It is quite sunny and cool, with northwesterly to northeasterly winds. Here and south of Ma'anshan Island, the weather will turn cloudy, with localized fog or light showers, with northeasterly winds. South of Japan, there is a cyclone due to the low pressure moving northeast-east. Also, in the four hours before 3:00 pm yesterday, the highest temperature in Shanghai was 75.4 and the lowest was 66.9. On the same day last year, the highest was 73.4 and the lowest was 57.9.</p>

<h3>Sino-British Cultural Association; Concerned About London Bombing Victims; Launches Relief Donation Campaign</h3>
<p>(Chongqing Airmail) The Sino-British Cultural Association, in response to the London bombing victims, has launched a relief donation campaign. A donation notice was issued on the 13th, roughly stating: "During China's three years of resistance, the British people have raised funds to help Chinese wounded soldiers and refugees, such as the London Mayor's fundraising and the British dispatch of medical teams to China, which are clear to everyone. Recently, the British capital London and other places have also suffered fierce bombings. The Chinese people, in view of the courtesy of returning a favor, cannot but have a concrete expression. Although we cannot widely solicit donations or obtain large sums of money, we hope that you will donate according to your ability, so that we can gather the strength of the many and transfer the funds to the British Ambassador in China for remittance to Britain to help the bombing victims." This fundraising is scheduled to end at the end of this month. The initiators are Wang Shijie, the chairman of the association, as well as Zeng Rongfu, the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Luo Jialun, the president of Central University.</p>

<h3>Heads of Departments Appointed for Fujian Provincial Research Institute</h3>
<p>(Fuzhou, 20th) In order to attract outstanding talents who have studied abroad and graduated from universities to engage in various types of advanced academic research, and to cultivate true specialists to meet the needs of national construction, the Fujian Provincial Government established the Provincial Research Institute last year. Sa Benting (President of Xiamen University), who also served as the director of the institute, recently resigned. The Provincial Government has now appointed Shen Mingxun to serve concurrently. The location of the institute has also been moved. The institute is internally divided into five departments: Natural Sciences, Agriculture, Industry, Medicine, and Society. Each department is headed by one director, and Xie Yuming, Yan Jiaxian, Bao Keyong, He Jiaqian, and Wu Zhigou have been appointed respectively.</p>
<h3>Hunan Provincial Government Holds Educational Symposium; Discussing Production in Various Schools; Producing to Achieve Self-Sufficiency</h3>
<p>(Laiyang Correspondent) Chairman Xue (Yue) of the Hunan Provincial Government attaches great importance to school education. All public and private schools in the province should be thoroughly inspected. Those with outstanding achievements will be rewarded, and those with poor management and poor performance will be punished or banned depending on the severity of the circumstances. Secretary-General Li (Yangjing) followed the discussion and conducted a thorough investigation. On the afternoon of September 24, he sent letters to Speaker Zhao of the Provisional Council, Deputy Speaker Chen, and heads of various agencies, inviting them to attend the Educational Symposium in the Provincial Government Auditorium to discuss matters related to the rectification of private secondary schools. A total of more than ten people attended, including Secretary Li (Yangjing) of the Provincial Government, Speaker Zhao (Hengti) and Deputy Speaker Chen (Runlin) of the Provisional Council, Secretary Xiang (Yujie) of the Council, as well as council members Chang (Bucheng) and Fang (Zhenggang), Secretary-General Liao (Weifan) and Committee Members Chen (Diguang), He (Chuqiang), and Xiao (Xun) of the Provincial Party Headquarters, Committee Members Tan (Yiru) and Wang (Guanghai) of the Provincial Government, and the heads of various departments, Deputy Commander Liao (Mingou), Acting Chief Committee Member Qiu (Ao), Li Zhongren, Shusen), Accounting Director Zhou (Sen), Director Yong (Jiayuan), and Manager Qiu (Guowei).</p>
<p>First, Secretary-General Li reported on the purpose of the meeting. Then, Director Zhu reported that the deadline for the unapproved private secondary schools to apply for approval according to the regulations on banning them had long passed, and they had been repeatedly urged, but some had not yet been approved. The government had not enforced the regulations to order them to close down. He hoped that everyone would provide guidance on this difficult situation so that a satisfactory solution could be obtained. Then, various proposals were discussed. First, regarding unapproved private secondary schools, the Hunan Province's regulations on banning unapproved private secondary schools have been promulgated, but there are many difficulties in enforcement. How should this be resolved? Second, regarding approved private secondary schools, (1) Is the draft plan for assessing the subsidy standards for each school appropriate? (2) Implement a production movement in each school so that they can be self-sufficient. The period for receiving school subsidies is proposed to be limited to a maximum of ten years from the 30th year of the Republic. The progress of production in each school should be reported to the department for record. Is this approved? (3) How should the location of approved private secondary schools be distributed in the future? Acting Chief Committee Member Qiu (Ao), Secretary-General Liao (Weifan), Committee Members Chen (Diguang), He (Chuqiang), and Fang (Zhenggang) all expressed important opinions on the above two conditions. Except for the first item, they all unanimously advocated that the government should conduct a thorough investigation, grant a generous time limit, and strictly follow the official orders. For the first item of the second case, the participants will submit their written opinions to the Education Department within one week for further processing. The second and third items were also discussed and satisfactory resolutions were reached. The meeting resulted in a very satisfactory outcome.</p>

<h3>Cold Outcome in Western League First Division Soccer; Portugal Unexpectedly Loses to Western Patrol; Results in a Miserable 5-4 Defeat by One Goal; Portuguese Trailed 4-1 in the First Half</h3>
<p>In the Western League First Division soccer match, Portugal and Western Patrol met at Yiyuan yesterday, resulting in an unexpected cold outcome where Portugal was defeated by Western Patrol with a score of 5-4. Western Patrol took the lead with a score of 4-1 in the first half, leaving Portugal helpless. Despite their efforts to attack in the second half, they still lost by one goal. The lineups of the two teams are as follows:</p>
<p>Western Patrol</p>
<p>Bo'erping</p>
<p>Hutelai Weiketai</p>
<p>Lueliezitefei Jibosheng</p>
<p>Que Lunzifu Fangsaiga Feihuate Beida Shitengqie</p>
<p>Portugal</p>
<p>Sueshi</p>
<p>Aikuinuo Leimidi</p>
<p>Aolieweila J. Kao Sitai J. Leimidi</p>
<p>Leimidi Gain Fafanxiao Kelasha Leimidi</p>
<p>Western Patrol's Victory</p>
<p>Western Patrol's mid-line was exceptionally good yesterday, causing the Portuguese to retreat in fear, which was one of the key factors for their victory. With the help of the former St. Francis star Shitengqie and the sprinting star Fangxuejia, they were majestic and made the Portuguese merchants bow their heads. When the score was 3-5, the Portuguese merchants chased to 4-5, with only one goal difference, the Portuguese merchants' offensive was unstoppable. Unfortunately, they failed in the end.</p>
<p>Policeman's Majesty</p>
<p>In addition to the two heroes Shitengqie and Fangxuejia, the rest of the Western Patrol team are all veterans. Goalkeeper Bo'erbin was a member of the B team last year, but he is also quite skilled. After the two teams were ready in the morning, the police took a flanking offensive and raided the Portuguese merchants' position. The Portuguese merchants are all veterans, but the front line lacks the Luo Chailiao brothers and the central defender lacks Xue Erfo, so their movements were hindered. In addition, they have been away from the battlefield for a long time. Once they entered the arena, the Portuguese merchants' inner room had been searched once by Santou Bao, and one city was confiscated. Before long, Shitengqie, a former member of St. Francis who had just donned the tiger skin, performed a "hat trick," scoring three goals in a row, causing the Portuguese merchants to lose four times. The morale of the army was shaken, and the audience was also stunned. After a long time, the Portuguese merchants finally hit Bo'erbin once in a difficult resistance, and the first half ended with a score of 4-1.</p>
<p>A Pity to Lose</p>
<p>After eating the lemons, the fire continued. Shitengqie was particularly energetic and added another arrow to the Portuguese merchants in an instant. Although the Portuguese were hit once by Leimidi, they still lacked vitality, and the police veterans' arrogance was still fierce. But a strange peak suddenly rose, and after Fafanfan broke through the center, Gain hit the red heart again. Thus, from an absolute downward trend of 0-4, they closely chased to a close situation of 4-5, and a glimmer of light had been revealed for the future, and hope was even stronger. The Portuguese soldiers were a hundred times more courageous, and launched a melee battle in the last ten minutes. Unfortunately, the Portuguese merchants were unlucky. When Fafanxiao succeeded and tied the score at 5-5, the judge Wu Shouheng judged it as offside and invalidated it. All the hopes were suddenly wiped out. One minute later, the final whistle blew, and the Portuguese merchants were finally defeated by Western Patrol with a score of 4-5.</p>
<h3>Qibu Table Tennis Association Launches Table Tennis Hard Ball Competition; Chen Linsheng Donates a Large Silver Cup; Meeting to Discuss Matters at Da Sanxing Today</h3>
<p>Since table tennis in Shanghai has been enthusiastically promoted by all sectors of society, it has sprung up like mushrooms. However, table tennis balls are divided into two types: soft and hard. European and American countries use hard balls, while China adheres to the old rules and still uses soft balls. However, in order to seek progress in technology and step onto the world table tennis stage, it is necessary to quickly reform and practice hard balls more. It is learned that Chen Linsheng, chairman of the Qibu Table Tennis Association, has spared no effort in promoting hard balls and has repeatedly launched appeals over the years, requesting all sectors of society to promote them. However, due to a lack of response, it has been delayed until now, making it difficult for China's table tennis level to reach its peak. Mr. Chen is now donating a large silver cup in order to improve table tennis standards, promote international glory, and cultivate talents, to hold a hard ball table tennis individual championship to promote it. However, due to limited capacity, participants are temporarily limited to members. If the trial run achieves excellent results, a full Shanghai public group league will be launched. The association is scheduled to hold a staff meeting at 2:00 pm today (the 21st) on the third floor of the Da Sanxing Restaurant to discuss all the proceedings of the cup competition and to determine the opening date and competition rules. According to the table tennis cup competitions launched by all sectors of society in Shanghai for more than ten years, none have been held with hard balls. The association has taken this into consideration and has taken the lead in launching it. Its contribution to the table tennis community is very great. It is expected that various groups will promote it one after another in the future. Not only will China's table tennis level be improved from now on, but also, if we plan ahead, we will be able to compete on the world stage and definitely promote and earn international glory. The following members are requested to attend on time:</p>
<p>Chen Linsheng, Chuan Guiqing, Cheng Shuming, Mao Yong, Yang Kaiyun, Hu Yiping, Feng Chanchu, Weng Zhichao, Fan Hanqing, Xiao Fei, Hu Zhongfa, Cheng Zhichun, Jiang Zongdi, Xu Junyan, Xia Guisheng.</p>
<h3>Guangshi Cup Basketball; Was Not Held Yesterday Due to Rain</h3>

<h3>Dismissal. Theft. Rewards for Arrest, etc. Yu Huo</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a familiar classmate from my hometown rushed to my place early in the morning, his face showing rare panic. I hurriedly asked him what trouble he was in.</p>
<p>"I'm unemployed too!" This was his mournful voice.</p>
<p>I was stunned and confused. Because as far as I knew, he was not only a cautious and lovable young man, but also a diligent and upright clerk in the sock factory where he worked, and had always been trusted by his manager. This sudden announcement of unemployment was bound to make people wonder!</p>
<p>According to his account, I learned that the reason for his dismissal for being considered irregular was that the manager said he was "not dedicated to his work!" The so-called "not dedicated" was because my classmate, taking advantage of his social activities, took on some business outside of his duties—selling small pieces of clothing. Unfortunately, one day a friend ran into his shop and loudly contacted him about that transaction, which was discovered by the manager. That evening, he was called to the manager's room and, under questioning, my classmate honestly admitted it. Thereupon, the manager immediately issued his order:</p>
<p>"Oh, in that case, please seek employment elsewhere!..."</p>
<p>He felt unable to laugh or cry. Yesterday, he had to leave the shop with his bedding on his shoulder. Although he only had his own burden, his job was, after all, the source of his livelihood today. Therefore, he looked distressed and asked me to find him a place to eat.</p>
<p>I felt inexplicably uneasy! Although I looked at his personal experience, I couldn't help but shed tears of sympathy for him, but because of my humble position and lack of influence, I only had the intention but couldn't find a way to help.</p>
<p>However, the sudden dismissal of my classmate made me recall the incident a few days ago, reported in the local news section of this newspaper, about the four employees of Sincere Company who were arrested and executed for theft. At the same time, the advertisements "Reward for the Arrest of Fugitive Partner ×××" that can be found from time to time in the advertisement section, like these cases and the situation encountered by my classmate, although they are two different things, the hardships in the lives of industrial and commercial workers during this period have more or less some common ground.</p>
<p>Since the surge in prices in this isolated city has become increasingly fierce, thousands of industrial and commercial workers, living in a state of expensive rice and firewood, are mostly facing their line of starvation and cold. Under the desire for "survival," who doesn't try to find other profitable "outlets" besides their existing low-paying jobs? Therefore, my classmate's additional side business was really not an unexpected attempt, and it did not have a great impact on his work, because his diversified activities were entirely done in his spare time. How could it be considered a crime of "not being dedicated to his work"? At the same time, some, unable to "find a way out" and unable to make a living, and with weak wills, have created the tragedy of suicide. Those with a strong desire to live, either abuse their power for personal gain or commit various acts of theft and embezzlement of public funds and property. Can we say that this is a personal crime, a shameless scum? (Of course, there are also some who steal to compensate for their infatuation with theaters and dance halls, but they are not the majority.)</p>
<p>This is a social disease. As long as one is not oblivious to reality, everyone can see the threat of death that the demons (including speculators who hoard and manipulate) around this isolated city are imposing on the people of the city, creating countless pain and sin!</p>
<p>In this great era, I have always believed in the importance of unity between the upper and lower classes, neighbors and relatives. Only mutual harmony can prevent us from being taken advantage of by the demons of the times and seek common safety to tide over this difficult stage. From my classmate's unemployment and some social news such as "reward for arrest" and "suicide by poison," I sincerely hope that the authorities in the industrial and commercial sectors can show more understanding and help for the living conditions of workers, directly relieve the suffering of colleagues, and indirectly reduce the occurrence of crime in society.</p>
<h3>On "Dengue Fever" Ke Deqiong</h3>
<p>"Dengue" is the internationally used name for this disease. The word "dengue" is not a personal name, but means "decoration" in Spanish, probably referring to the red rash that covers the whole body. In English, it is also called Dendy Fever, meaning "dandy fever," probably because those who suffer from it mostly have flushed faces, like richly decorated dandies. It is also called breakbone fever, because the limbs and bones are so painful that it feels like a fracture. Our country used to call it "gan zheng," which means "sore pain," also named for its characteristic of soreness and pain.</p>
<p>This disease is mostly prevalent in autumn and summer, in low-lying areas near rivers and seas, and is rare in highlands, so it has a close relationship with mosquitoes. The speed and scope of the spread of this disease are the giants of various infectious diseases, and no other disease can surpass its high infection rate. It was first discovered in Egypt and Java in 1779. In 1872, Xiamen, Fujian, and in 1902, Shantou and Chaozhou, Guangdong, there were severe epidemics, with up to 80% of residents being infected. The current epidemic originated in the Songjiang area. In July and August, nine out of ten people in Songjiang were ill. At that time, some thought it was paratyphoid, and some thought it was the flu. In the past month, Shanghai has also been affected and is spreading rapidly. Shanghai has an extremely dense population. Although there are fewer mosquitoes than in the interior, bedbugs are everywhere and suck human blood, so they may also be a medium for transmission. According to the infection rate of previous years, the number of victims will reach at least one million, which is truly alarming. Fortunately, although there is no specific treatment for this disease, nor is there any way to prevent it, it is rarely dangerous if it goes well, and the epidemic period is not long, at most two months, so it will soon disappear on its own.</p>

<h3>Speaking of Eating Crabs Bo Wenyan</h3>
<p>"This year's crabs are really expensive, and it's a small year!" I've heard this lament more than once.</p>
<p>For the rich, rice, which is even more expensive than crabs, is piled up in warehouses in thousands of bags. A few dollars for a crab might not even be enough to whet their appetites. Those who are poor and squeezed in line to buy cheap rice probably won't have the mood to compose poems in front of the crab stalls, right? So, what does "really expensive" and "small year" have to do with it?</p>
<p>But I have heard this lament more than once.</p>
<p>Who is lamenting?</p>
<p>Expensive rice and firewood seem to have already bent their backs, but those with a "love of good food," such as seasonal delicacies like crabs, still have the desire to "try" them, so they feel it's too expensive; and, it's a small year!</p>
<p>Merely lamenting, of course, is bound to be a bit "mouthwatering." After looking at the rice in the rice jar, they still choose to buy a few smaller ones. Only after eating them do they feel like they've fulfilled their responsibility as a person; however, they might still reluctantly add, "In previous years, you could buy a bunch of crabs like this for one dollar!" Then, they calculate how many dollars this feast cost in total, and then convert it into how many liters of rice could be bought with that amount. At this time, they can't help but lament again; this lament is the sorrow of lamenting one's lack of money.</p>
<p>There are not a few people like this. Eating crabs is like this, how can other things be any different!</p>
<h3>The Hawthorne Case: The Dancer's Fate Cheng Xiaoqing</h3>
<p>Chapter 9 Amazing News</p>
<p>I couldn't help but be surprised to see him like this. "What? Tell me. What did you remember?"</p>
<p>Old Mao stammered, "These—these leather shoes—belong to Manager Lu. He gave them to me when they were old."</p>
<p>I thought to myself, if Old Mao's explanation is not false, it can indeed dispel a suspicion. Otherwise, it would be too coincidental that the nail print on the floor is the same as the shoes of both Lu Jiansheng and Old Mao. I asked, "Oh, Manager Lu gave you these leather shoes? When did he give them to you?"</p>
<p>Old Mao thought for a moment and replied, "That was still at the end of last year—Sir, you don't have to be suspicious, this isn't fake. Manager Lu didn't give me these leather shoes directly, Miss Wang gave them to me. Jinmei saw it when she gave it to me, you can ask her—Sir, I think—" He paused again.</p>
<p>I urged, "Why don't you say it? What do you think?"</p>
<p>Old Mao licked his lips and replied, "I think since the footprint on the floor is the same size as these leather shoes, maybe Manager Lu went in last night."</p>
<p>I lowered my head and thought for a moment, not answering, and asked again, "You really didn't go in last night?"</p>
<p>Old Mao looked straight at my face and said confidently, "I really didn't. There's not a word of falsehood in what I'm saying, I can swear to it."</p>
<p>I felt that his words seemed true and not false. For a moment, I couldn't think of any other questions that could prove it, so I nodded and said, "Okay, is Jinmei inside now? I want to talk to her."</p>
<p>Old Mao replied, "She's upstairs, I'll go call her." He turned around and walked out of the guardhouse, stood on the steps again, turned his head, "Should I call her here?"</p>
<p>I shook my head and said, "To the drawing-room."</p>
<p>Old Mao walked down the cement steps, passed through the short privet hedge, and walked along the already dry cement path towards the main house. I stood in the guardhouse for a while and looked around the small room. In addition to a wooden-framed bed, a small square table, and two Western-style straight-backed chairs, there was also a wicker box under the bed. (142)</p>

<p>Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation Edison Special Issue</p>
<h3>A Brief Biography of Edison</h3>
<p>The American humorist Ralph Waldo Emerson once said: "The true measure of cultural progress is not in the census, nor in the size of cities, nor in the harvest in the fields, but in the talents produced by the country." This is true, so everything about Edison is what every American considers to be a source of pride.</p>
<p>Edison can represent a typical American. He has a sense of humor, he loves his family, he has patience and courage, and he is kind and humane. He is basically the same as anyone on the street. He always thinks of others and rarely considers himself. Therefore, Will Rogers said that even if Edison had not invented anything, he would still be great.</p>
<p>To commemorate the 50th anniversary of Edison's invention of motion pictures, Hollywood's MGM Pictures has made his life into two films, "Young Edison" and "The Great Edison."</p>
<p>October 21st is the anniversary of his invention of the electric light bulb. This newspaper is publishing a special issue to express our utmost admiration for him. At the same time, the list of winners of the primary school students' summer homework competition, which was originally scheduled to be announced yesterday by this newspaper, will be announced in today's special issue. We hope that the children will learn from him, imitate him, and be as great as him in the future. Then the publication of this special issue will be even more meaningful. —Editor's Note</p>
<p>Edison was born in Milan, Ohio, USA, on February 11, 1847. His ancestors were Dutch. His grandfather was a royalist, so after the revolution, he was exiled to Canada. His father was a revolutionary, so he moved from Canada to the United States. His mother was a teacher, originally from Scotland and a combination of the Quaker religion. His family was not well-off in his childhood, but his nature of diligent study was revealed very early on. For example, seeing geese sitting on eggs and hatching goslings after a long time, he would sit on chicken eggs, hoping to hatch chicks.</p>
<p>He went to school, but the teacher thought he was foolish, so he only attended school for three months before being sent home. At the age of eleven, he began to experiment with various chemicals in a small house at home. He had twenty large bottles, all labeled "Poisonous" to prevent family members from playing with them. He also bought other chemicals from pharmacies in the countryside and mixed them himself. This asset gradually increased, and by the age of fifteen, he already had many important books on chemistry and physics.</p>
<p>At that time, his family moved to Port Huron. He sold candy and newspapers on the train, and used the extra money to buy chemicals and experiment in the baggage car, and published a weekly newspaper. But unfortunately, one day the phosphorus powder spilled and immediately caught fire. The conductor immediately put it out with water, but the conductor's anger did not subside. When the train stopped, he expelled him and severely hit his ear, making him deaf. His printing press and chemicals were scattered all over the ground, causing him to cry bitterly.</p>
<p>He collected the chemicals and printing press and published a small newspaper, commenting on the people of the town, which aroused public anger, and he was thrown into the small river. The small newspaper was forced to cease publication.</p>
<p>At that time, he had a strong desire to read, but he had no opportunity to attend school, so he had to read in the library in his spare time, and he gained a rough understanding of various sciences.</p>
<p>When he was selling newspapers on the train, the stationmaster's son was in distress one day. Fortunately, he rescued him. The stationmaster was very grateful, so he taught him telegraphy. Four months later, he had practiced very well, so he joined the railway service.</p>
<p>In 1868, he went to Boston and joined Western Union Telegraph Company. He was one of the fastest telegraphers there. At the same time, he invented the election recording machine there. At that time, he was only twenty-one years old. In 1869, he went to New York, and in 1870, he made a stock ticker, which he got a reward of four yuan for. In 1873, he married Miss Mary Stilwell.</p>
<p>He used that income to build a laboratory, which he later moved to Menlo Park in 1876.</p>
<p>With the joint efforts of many comrades, after many failures, and numerous times of approaching the number two-five-five.</p>
<p>In 1884, Miss Mary Stilwell passed away. In 1886, he remarried Miss Nina Miller. On October 18, 1931, this great scientist passed away, but the happiness he gave to people will always be praised by mankind.</p>
<p>There are many things in Edison's life that are worthy of young people to emulate. The first is his spirit of hard work. When he invented the electric light, he invented the electric light bulb on October 11, 1879. This was his greatest invention in his life. He has patented a total of one thousand one hundred and fifty inventions.</p>
<p>On December 21, 1879, the New York Herald published a full page of news detailing his invention of the light bulb, and a public trial was held on Christmas of that year. More than 3,000 people visited.</p>
<p>In 1880, he founded a power plant, which was established in New York's Pearl Street. Even for the filament alone, he tested it 9,000 times before succeeding.</p>
<p>He often worked day and night, without sufficient rest time. When he first arrived in New York, he really didn't have the money to rent a house, so he rested in the factory for four hours. Because he worked sixteen hours a day, his life was actually twice as long as others. He once said that time is the most precious thing in the world because it cannot be bought with money.</p>
<p>He worked hard throughout his life to invent, but the things he invented were all needed by mankind. He was unwilling to invent anything that mankind did not need.</p>
<p>He worked hard and didn't care about his clothing. He spent all his money on books and equipment. He never went to hotels to waste his time.</p>
<p>He had a habit of taking notes at any time. All his books were full of annotations. Books were his best companion. Once, when he invented something, he studied it for six weeks, eating and sleeping at the workplace, and did 2,000 trials before succeeding.</p>
<h3>A Summary of the Evolution of Electric Light Bulbs</h3>
<p>· Edison invented the electric light bulb.</p>
<p>· Dr. Coolidge invented the tungsten filament vacuum bulb.</p>
<p>· Dr. Langmuir invented the argon gas bulb.</p>
<p>· Mr. Peake invented the frosted bulb.</p>
<p>· The latest modern coiled filament bulb.</p>
<p>Several people in the world have worked hard to invent the electric light bulb. Before Edison's invention, several British people also had the same intentions, but they did not succeed.</p>
<p>After Edison installed the stock ticker in New York, he received a reward of 40,000 yuan. He used this money to build a laboratory. With the joint efforts of many comrades, he invented many things.</p>
<p>He thought that the arc lamp that was used at that time needed to be transformed, so he was determined to invent the electric light. He wanted to use electric current to heat a certain object without breaking it, because heat and light cannot be separated. The higher the temperature, the greater the light. According to the records in many books, he decided to use carbon first. Although it can burn in the air, it will eventually burn out, so the air must be removed.</p>
<p>He put a paper strip in a glass bottle, and it burned out after eight minutes. Carbon seemed unreliable, but after trying other metals such as platinum alloy, he still used carbon, but after the current passed, the carbon tended to melt. His exhaust fan was not sophisticated, so the light bulbs he made could only burn for fifteen minutes at most.</p>
<p>In 1879, he got a perfect exhaust fan that could remove all the air, so he used carbon again. At that time, he first made an object like a hair from ordinary cotton thread, then put it in the stove to burn, and then put it in a nickel model and put it into a glass bulb. On the evening of October 21, 1879, the first light bulb was successfully created and continued to burn for forty hours.</p>
<p>Edison once said: We sat and watched the electric light continue to burn. The longer it burned, the more surprised and happy we were.</p>
<p>However, the light bulbs made at that time were not ideal, so they have been improved many times. Because the first electric light bulb was created by Edison, Edison is the ancestor of modern light bulbs.</p>
<p>After his first invention, he and engineers from various countries continued to improve them. In 1905, German Dr. Aner Von Wklsb</p>

<h3>Edison's Weekly Newspaper</h3>
<p>When Edison went to the train to work as a newspaper and candy vendor, in addition to sending part of the money he earned back home, he successively added his property to the baggage car. Once he bought a hand-cranked printing press and published a weekly newspaper Weekly Herald. Using his experience in telegraphy, he also inquired about news from the telegraph offices at each station, so the news he published was the latest.</p>
<p>Although Edison was only fifteen years old when he ran the newspaper, he was very amazing in terms of management methods. He understood the true meaning of journalism, and he also understood the proper way to run a newspaper.</p>
<p>In that weekly newspaper, there was the following announcement:</p>
<p>"To the managers of the Grand Trunk Line: Please give the subscription form to the newsboy T. Edison at the Drew Combined Station. We will be very grateful. Please attach the newspaper fee of eight cents per month, absolutely paid in advance."</p>
<p>In that weekly newspaper, it was divided into several columns. Each column has its own characteristics. In the "Hope" column, the following passage was published: According to the recently announced law, all the pubs in Port Huron are restricted to opening until this Sunday. This kind of move is really necessary, because this kind of pub is really disgusting.</p>
<p>From the newspaper he edited, interviewed, published, and distributed, it can also be seen that he had a talent for poetry, because he often published several poems.</p>
<p>Although the size of his newspaper was not large, the content can be said to be all-encompassing. International news was also given considerable importance, so in one issue, there was a piece of news saying: According to news from Paris, the Chinese emperor will send a special ambassador to be permanently stationed in Britain and France.</p>
<p>The "Prices" column can also be said to be one of the characteristics of the weekly newspaper. From this column, we can see that the prices at that time were:</p>
<p>Eggs 12 cents per dozen.</p>
<p>Chickens 10 to 20 cents per piece.</p>
<p>Turkeys 50 to 60 cents per piece.</p>
<p>Ducks 30 cents per pair.</p>
<h3>Things Invented by Edison</h3>
<p>The things invented by Edison are too numerous to count. Here are some of the more important ones.</p>
<p>Election Recording Machine: This was his first patented invention, but it was rejected by the authorities at the time.</p>
<p>Telephone Transmitter: Alexander Bell's invention of the telephone would not have been successful without Edison's invention of the carbon transmitter.</p>
<p>Stock Ticker: He received a reward of $40,000 from this invention. He did not trust banks, so he brought the cash to the factory.</p>
<p>Telegraph Repeater: From this invention, four telegrams could be sent simultaneously on the same transmitter. He earned a net profit of $30,000, but attempts to invent more complex transceivers failed.</p>
<p>Megaphone: This invention could transmit a person's voice over a mile away and was actually the predecessor of the long-distance telephone.</p>
<p>Motion Pictures: He invented the famous Kinetoscope.</p>
<p>Phonograph: Many inventors thought this was the simplest invention.</p>
<p>Electric Light: This was Edison's most important invention. Before its success, he experienced countless failures.</p>
<p>Mining Machine: In Edison, New Jersey, there were many inventions for mining engineering.</p>
<p>Submarine: He made many contributions to the submarine.</p>
<p>Wireless Telegraph: After this invention, telegrams could be sent at any time from vehicles in motion.</p>
<p>Other Inventions: Address printing machine, document copier, glass plate, real-piercing fruit packaging method, phonograph, electric train, improved typewriter, storage battery, etc.</p>
<p>(Continued from page fifteen)</p>
<p>, invented the Osmium Lamp. Later, because osmium was scarce and expensive, it was not practical. In the same year, Dr. Whitney, an engineer at the American General Electric Company, invented the Gem Lamp, which still used carbon filaments but subjected them to high heat, making them more energy-efficient and brighter than previous carbon filament lamps.</p>
<p>In 1906, Dr. Werner V on Bolton of Germany invented the Tantalum Lamp, but it was still easy to burn out. It was not until 1907 that two Austrian youths, Alexander Just and Franz Hanaman, used a metal called tungsten to make filaments and sold the patent rights to General Electric Company. Dr. W. D. Collidge of the company improved it in 1911, and the filaments of current light bulbs are all made of tungsten.</p>
<p>Since then, there have been several more progressive steps: In 1929, Dr. Irving Langmuir invented the nitrogen-filled bulb, which was later improved to become the argon-filled bulb (commonly known as the "half bulb").</p>
<p>In 1924, Louis E. Mitchell and Arthur J. White invented the method of removing the tip of the bulb. Soon after, Mr. Marvin Pipkin, an engineer at General Electric Company, invented a type of bulb with a frosted interior.</p>
<p>The improvement of electric lights is endless. The latest is the coiled coil filament, which doubles the coiling of the filament, coiling it three thousand two hundred times in a space of two centimeters, making the light brighter. Shanghai General Electric Edison Factory, based on the various new inventions of the US headquarters, manufactures General Electric Edison light bulbs, which can produce ten times the light of Edison's invented light bulbs using the same amount of electricity. The factory is constantly continuing its efforts and striving for improvement. An interesting thing is that the factory director, Mr. J. S. King, was a colleague of Edison at the time. Mr. J. Mokerjs, the general manager of China and Bulb Company, which is responsible for the distribution of General Electric Edison light bulbs, and Mr. Fu Yaocheng, the director of the Shanghai business department, have also served at General Electric Company in the United States for a long time.</p>
