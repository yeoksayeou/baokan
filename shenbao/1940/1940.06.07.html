<h3>德軍渡索美河　猛攻法軍陣地遭阻遏　坦克隊衝入香巴臬區被擊毀　德方宣稱突破魏剛防綫數點</h3>
<p>巴黎此間軍界入士頃談稱、今晨前錢　事、又趨劇烈、德軍除分三路（一在亞眠區·二在貝隆納區·三在埃納河與瓦士河間之亞勒說運河）進攻而外、其砲隊並在索美河下游、向香巴臬區我軍陣地猛轟、似欲掩護陸軍進攻但我軍陣地、均置有抵抗戰車之工事、頗篇得用、是以陣地屹然未動、五日傍晚、德國戰車多輛、雖一度衝過我軍陣地、但因陸軍部隊未能及時跟進之故、卒爲我軍所擊毀、（六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>巴黎　敵軍在索美河下游集中大批坦克車向我陣地進攻、該處我軍前哨站、曾於昨日一度擊退敞軍、茲爲戰略關係、已於昨夜自動後撇矣、（六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>巴黎　此間軍界人士頃談稱、德軍昨在亞勒脫運河流域夫人大道、猛烈進攻、迨至今晨、又運到各種口徑之大砲甚多、當即開砲轟擊、勢甚猛烈、似　掩護陸軍都隊進攻模樣、此外、並放出大批烟幕彈、以致前綫上空幾爲濃烟所蔽、視綫爲之不明、其用意除掩護軍隊進攻而外、並欲阻止法國飛機偵察、至於雙方空軍、均極活躍、英法兩國飛機、昨曾與德發生空戰、並在前綫轟炸德軍步兵及坦克車隊、（六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>巴黎　總司令部　於今夜發出公報稱、「自本日清晨四時起、敵軍採取新攻勢右亞眠城貝羅納城及亞勒脫運河流域一帶、以坦克隊爲先鋒、向我軍陣地進攻、但均被擊退、我軍扼守陣地屹然未動、此外我國空軍極爲活躍、轟炸機一隊、曾於昨夜飛往德國慕尼黑城路特魏哈芬港、轟炸各重要工廠飛行塲與鐵路車站、類皆命中、並有數處地力、中彈起火、我方機羣又乘機作偵察飛行、獲有重要情報、」（五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>巴黎　此間軍界人士頃談稱、德軍自本日淸晨四時起、不斷向我　陣地猛攻、迄至傍晚始止、其攻勢共分三路、一在亞眠區、二在貝隆納區、三在埃納河與瓦士河間之亞勒脫運河流域、其他地方、戰事不甚激烈、亞眠與貝隆納一綫德軍在索美河左岸佔有橋頭二處、乃以此爲　點、在大砲飛機坦克車掩護之下、向法軍陣地猛攻、來勢愈演愈烈、但法軍陣地以天險爲屏障、防綫重疊、是以德國坦克車之前進、匪特遭遇堅決抵抗、且有河流森林爲之陣礙、縱使衝過法軍陣地、但步兵隊伍及輜重隊、未能接踵前進、則坦克車隊無從取獲接濟、孤軍深入、法軍大可拊其背而予以重創、本日情形正復如是蓋德國坦克車隊雖在某處地方突破法軍陣地、但在大體上法軍陣綫完整無缺、一般情形、可認爲順適云、（五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>巴黎　昨夜據法方負責人士聲稱、法軍刻正堅守以抗極劇烈之敵軍攻擊、或須有放棄若干不重要陣地之必要、德方以特別雄厚之軍隊進撲索美河法軍左翼、已在索美河上架橋三座而達南岸（六日路透社電）</p>
<p>巴黎　今晨黎明、索美河戰爭重開之際、法國軍隊因戰略關係、已自海濱至亞眠之陣綫、略爲退一却、惟仍固守其他未經衝破之陣地、德軍因圖轉向勒哈佛爾及森河下游、遂對號剛陣綫之極右部、施以極重大之壓力、（六日合衆電）</p>
<h3>德軍戰報</h3>
<p>柏林　德軍總司令部昨晚宣稱、我軍今晨展開戰檢、進攻法軍、越過索美河、將所謂「魏剛防綫」擊破數點、（六日海通電）</p>
<p>柏林　此間權威方面稱、德國軍隊將於一星期內開入巴黎、法軍二度反攻、均被德軍擊退、昨晚八時、德軍在英吉利海峽與馬奇諾防綫間之「極廣闊戰綫推進、其目標有二、「第一、完全切斷英法間之聯絡、第二、造成足以進犯英國之新據點、」衆信德軍將向西南海沿岸由索美河至勒哈弗爾進擊、而斯瓦松附近另一支軍則將直指巴黎挺進、此乃史萊芬計劃之變相、（六日合衆電）</p>
<p>柏林　德國軍事專家頃向海通社訪員評論德軍司令部之戰報稱、吾軍於佔領鄧扣克之後一日、俘獲法軍人數、足有四萬名、中有將官三人、但未俘獲英軍、吾軍已在該處組成防綫、開始向前進攻、吾軍在西綫發動進攻後之四星期內、殲滅英國遠征軍、將其殘餘部隊驅出大陸、法軍現已陷入單獨作戰之地位、前日戰報所載吾軍琴克斯式轟炸機轟炸集中在阿白維爾迤南之軍隊、此乃殲毀敵軍兵力之又一例證、德機之轟炸哈佛港、可謂對法國北岸海港之重大打擊、按該港與法國經濟上極有關係、法國輸入之煤油多數均由該港入口、（六日海通電）</p>
<p>柏林　據此間所接消息稱、阿白維爾附近昨日敵軍以坦克車來犯、德軍高射砲隊與守軍聯絡、加以擊退、計坦克車七輛中高射砲彈而炸燬、（六日海通電）</p>
<p>柏林　以昨晚此間各方情形觀之、德國計劃係於最後大舉進犯英國以前、首先壓倒法國、納粹方面指稱、苟此次之進攻得令法國屈膝、置彼於戰爭以外、則德國可以集中之力量攻擊英國、而免後顧之憂、非然者、倘德國迅即淮擊央國、則將分散其軍力、且有兩面受敵之危險、（六日合衆電）、候於平射砲旁、俟坦克車駛近、即在短距離內開砲猛轟、德軍乃陷於交織之火網中、法軍機關槍手則迫使德軍傳寫即摩托自動車兵與機械化步兵止於其彈雨前、坦克車數輛曾無輔助、賡續前駛且有數輛竟達法軍後方、而在該地爲法軍聚攻而毀之、發言人切實聲明此僅爲德方所望決勝的大戰之發軔、故旦夕將見展至兩翼更劇烈之戰鬥、今日黎明德軍無數坦克車駛至索美河下游、大約今日將在該地作主要之進攻、他翼位於埃萊特與夫人大道之右者、德軍砲隊曾猛轟不巳、此顯爲新大攻勢之先聲、昨夜法飛機空襲之際、曾在諾曼第境擊落德飛機七架、大約尚在中央境擊落三架、據倫敦負責方面消息、德軍此次之攻勢、其戰術與前施諸比國及北法者大同小異、彼等現圖在法軍防綫覓一弱點、一經發見將傾其所有之全力衝入、法方現承認德軍已在數處獲有進步、但須知法軍佈防甚深、德軍之進步、不能稱爲攻入也、惟今次之大戰現尚無確切消息、德軍且在阿米安·尤其爲貝隆納附近、及旭尼索瓦遜區攻擊、但德軍尚未到達索瓦遜、聞以上各區均有德軍之鐵甲車出現（六日路透電）</p>
<p>法軍在嚴重情勢下　沿兩河建立新防線</p>
<p>法軍前綫　昨日德軍意圖佔領巴黎而發動有力攻勢之後、記者即往索美·埃納前綫視察、發見法軍、於忽促之間盡力振作、以應付此次戰事、法軍現時防綫、即在此兩河流域以南之地帶、自海邊起至末期河區域止、駐於此防綫之法軍即係自比境退出後經改編者</p>
<p>法軍採新防禦策略　力阻德坦克隊攻勢</p>
<p>巴黎　權戚方面今日承認、向法京推進之德坦克車隊已衝破索美河陣錢、然否認該坦克車隊有「斧」之功效、據稱德方此項鋼甲怪物、已爲新防禦策略所圍、被制止於亞眠至拉翁一綫、又聞法軍對固定堡壘之理論、如建築馬奇諾陣綫之類、已放棄不用、現方集中其防守力量、以圖擊退德方坦克車隊之進攻、消息靈通人士稱、所謂新防禦策略、係將裝甲自動平射砲、配置於許多要點、據軍事專家估計、德方此次進攻、發兵四十五師、計有士兵七十五萬人、急降轟炸機一千架、坦克車二二五〇輛、摩托化戰具一萬五千具、又據目擊者謂、急降轟炸機均裝有銳鳴器、當其從數千呎高空疾降投彈時、慘厲之銳呼聲、與如雨之機槍彈齊發、至離地數百呎處、及投强烈炸彈、而後迅即上昇、（六日國際社電）</p>
<p>倫敦　巴黎法軍發言人今日聲稱、戰事今實際巳沿自海濱迄埃納河陣綫全部發展、戰至夜色蒼茫始見靜止、法軍所守之各支持點、　經德軍坦克車衝擊、屹然未動、敵坦克車會被迫停進、吾則前方許多坦克車陷阱正待之也、法軍堅守各村落與平原　播之障碍物、及狹谷或樹林兩面之矮林、此一防綫應稱、（一）索美埃納陣綫、在埃納河一段之軍隊、即構成抗戰軍隊之右翼、兩星斯前尚無所謂埃納防綫存在、因此一部分未曾進入比境之法軍、原沿比利時邊境駐守、因色當沙勒維爾梅西爾綫爲德陸空軍聯合勢力攻陷、於是不惜任何代價以建設新防錢、乃成爲必要此一問題之解決、在法軍司令部實際乃不可能、因法軍其時須盡力阻止德軍之前進、且阻止德軍前進之結果、就法總理萊諾所稱、巳使此第九軍完全趨於零亂無序、而萊諾之演詞中、並認此一軍隊之組織　亂爲一不幸之事實、爲遏制德軍及重建防錢、法坦克車隊遂立即奉令向前、不顧任何犧牲、猛力抵抗德機械化部隊、以少數之坦克車、（在若干戰鬥中德坦克車之數目、均較法坦克車多十倍、）與配備充分之巨坦克車周旋、法國機械化隊、在若干地帶損失頗巨、當時幸將德軍之　　阻止、當法國坦克車奮力拒敵之際、法司令部即命令法軍數師佔據埃納及亞丁納運河一帶之　綫、各師各團之司令官於接受命令時、尚不知德軍之　入色當、沙勒維爾及梅西也爾以南究有多遠、法軍各司令均係接受迅速之命令而佔據該陣綫、以極大之犧牲抵抗不知所在之敵人、據上次歐戰中服務美幽遠征軍之某一軍官語記者云、渠之軍隊、於接受開拔命令後、抵此方四小時、法國軍隊、雖曾遭受德軍之猛力衝擊、然其士氣仍極壯盛、與記者談話之兵士、均不約而同咸謂德軍此後、或不能再以其坦克車及飛機對若輩施行恫嚇、（六日合衆電）</p>
<h3>挪北聯軍　追擊德軍</h3>
<p>瑞典京城　阿夫頓報萊普斯蘭邊界訪電稱、恊約軍自那維克出發、沿運鐵砂之鐵路向瑞典邊陲挺進約十哩、而抵錫爾特維克、該地潰退德軍正據壕堅守、鐵路綫正遭軍纔及架置那維克高地之砲隊轟擊、協約軍則進迫巴恩斐爾（六日路透）</p>
<p>那維克　哈瓦斯社駐挪威國北部前綫訪員頃來電稱、聯軍於前日克復那維克港之後、法軍即在該港東面十七公里之錫爾狄克期區、沿鐵路東進、肅淸殘敵本日共俘獲　國士兵一百餘名、（六日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>美國禁軍需與日本</h3>
<p>美國對遠東，有其堅定之政策，而所以貫澈其政策者，尤能保持雍容之風格；蓋未嘗疾言厲色，夫嘗劍拔弩張，行之以各種不同之方式而不屈不撓，此誠美國外交之特徵。最近復有嶄新作爲，謂非對日，然證以往事，則制裁性質灼然可覩；特溫和而强健，殆有待侵略者在不甚難堪之中，省悟悔禍而已。往者，一九三八年十二月卅一日，美國致日通牒，表示維持九國公約曁中國門戶開放之決心，初未謂將以行動繼其後。一九三九年七月二十六日，通告廢止美日通商航海條約，以時代環境之變遷爲理由，亦未明言其爲制裁之始。十月十九日，駐日大使格魯氏在東京以演說之方式，轉述美國對日輿情之意態，剴切曉暢，婉轉而不示憤懣，不事攻訐。本年一月間，示意拒絕續訂商約之談判，及二十六日而如期實行宣告商約之失效。三四月間，調集海空大軍，破例演習於太平洋中心，並於事後明令留駐夏威夷；謂以自衛而警戒，非以示威。更於二年餘以來，再三貸中國以鉅款。凡此舉措，雖日人亦不諱言於其含義之嚴重，而美國則舉重若輕，如行所無事。及至昨日，更有二事焉：其一，國防軍需品一律禁運出口；其二，在阿拉斯加州規畫設立軍事根據地。阿拉斯加者，北美西北之半島，接近蘇聯而與日本對峙，隔離日本本部最近之美國領域也。據美國陸軍當局之說明：蘇聯在極東設防，距美國領域不足一百英里；蘇聯意在防範日本之侵襲西比利亞，但安知永無據以對付美國之日，故美國應有以與之抗衡云。其說甚妙，識者必能覘知美國之急起直追，果爲他日防俄，抑爲今日對日？關於國防軍需品之禁運出口，據美國國務院之說明：此舉並不包括於對日道德禁運範圍之內，僅因美國本國國防需要關係，始行禁止輸出云。頗傳美國禁運辦法，雖曰對各國一視同仁，但對英法與中國當另訂辦法，固不問所傳之確吾，通融之程度如何，然在事實上最受打擊者乃爲日本，則顯而易見者也。昨日字林西報東京特電稱：「美國行將禁運各種主要物品至其他國之消息，使日本復大爲震撼。此間均覺蒙受是項步驟之嚴重影響者，厥爲日本；雖美國表示爲自已需要之故而禁止輸出，但日本仍疑慮美國對於所同情之國家將予以優容，而日本則爲受此新規定之不利者。日本陸軍界消息靈通者稱，假使西方國家堅欲截斷日本之主要需要品，則日本當然將被逼向南進取」云。然則吾人謂美國對遠東有其堅定之政策，而雍容貫澈之於各種方式之下，竊自信爲不誣也。</p>
<p>電訉遙傳，語焉不詳。美國茲所禁止輸出者，或傳爲機械，或傳爲軍需品，或傳爲若干種主要物品，其細目與範圍，目前尚無確報。然察之日方今日反應之嚴重，考之日方歷來依恃美國物力之廣大，不斷想像美國禁令所影響及於日本之侵略者，將有何等意義。就一般貿易觀之：自一九三四年至一九三八年，計五年之間，日本對美輸出總額的共二十六萬萬圓，對美輸入約共四十五萬萬圓，日本入超達十九萬萬圓之鉅；此一方面固得視日本爲美國之大主顧，然一方面可見日本需要美貨之殷，美國供給日本物力之鉅。就美日兩國貿易商品觀之：日貨輸美者除生絲一項爲之大宗而外，則罐頭食品也，陶器也，磁器也，織物也，玩具也，茶也，菊也，凡此並非美國人民生活所必不可缺，抑且幷非必須取給於日本；顧日本以此交易之於美國者，以軍需品爲絕對多數。例以一九三七年之統計、美棉輸入日本者美金六千一百萬圓强，是爲大宗；此外，如屑鐵値美金三千七百萬圓强，銅一千八百萬圓弱，銑鐵一千萬圓弱，鋼塊八百七十萬圓强，汽油七百萬圓强，鋼鐵板五百七十萬圓强。片鋼四百四十萬圓强，皆轟炸中國之砲火原料也，以此數量，與日本自各國輸入之軍需品總數對比之，則佔總數百分之七十五乃至八十五，美國資日之比重，蓋可知矣。惟此比重，謂日本聞美國禁運而「大爲震撼」，情也，理也，勢必然也。彼於是悻然作色曰，我更不得不南進。日本蓄意南進，本報昨旣論之，初不以美國禁運而然；而美國亦把握其堅定政策，當然不因日本南進之恐嚇而放棄其禁運；吾人所欲拭目以觀者，遠東之侵略暴行，中國不但躬遭荼毒，且以抗戰使太平洋之他方面獲得苟安，則他方面固將如何追隨美國之後，一體禁止軍需品之輸出，以短縮侵略之荼毒耶！</p>

<p>羅馬　義大利是否參戰一事、本日在政治方面並無何種跡象可尋、外傳墨索里尼將於今晚發表重要演說、亦無從證實、據政界人士所獲印象、義當局或尚須延宕數日、始作最後決定、惟本日午後、曾有飛機數隊、每隊八架或十架不等、在此間作低空飛行、殆欲刺激人心、使國民在心理上、有所準備、迄至晚間、燎火管制亦較爲嚴密、多數街道、僅燃有黯淡之綠色電燈、（六日哈瓦斯社電）</p>

<h3>歐戰初起時的一片「中立」聲（一）</h3>
<p>— 叔棣</p>
<p>小引</p>
<p>去年九月初，英·法·波與德國正式開了戰。</p>
<p>當時，我正在倫敦，因爲想着現代戰爭破壞性的可怕，終日在擔心着，另一面，又因爲　有　　這人類史上重大事　　之好機會，終日在興奮着，我所研究的課目，恰恰又是「國　　　」，　是患着相當厲害的　氣病，也還是從早到晚地各處　　着，學校裏的研究　，大英博物館的參考　，敎授，同學，朋友們的地方，國會裏聽演說　論，出席各種研究會，街頭巷尾留心各式各樣人們的議論，……讀着，觀察着，聽着，討論着，　素着……。　了晚間—有時是深夜—疲乏地回到我的住處，煮起一壺濃濃的咖啡，對着一盞孤伶伶，似乎出奇地發着亮光的電燈，把當日所得的東西，片片段段地做着筆記，偶爾也撫摸着有點發麻微腫着的兩腿，但現在回想起來，當時似乎並沒有什麽感動，頂多不過是深深地抽一口氣；就又埋下了頭，去進行我的筆記，然而，目前翻　當時的筆記，浮到記憶上來的，却是另外碰到好幾次的兩　　　。</p>
<p>一件：</p>
<p>當正在專心做着筆記的時候，好些次，忽然被門上的，輕輕的叩　聲驚動了。</p>
<p>「誰在那裏」？</p>
<p>「原諒我，X君，你的「遮窗　」（“Blinder”）……」這是房東太太的聲音，有時是她的小姐的聲音。</p>
<p>「啊！我真抱歉得很呀！」　着忘記關嚴的，爲防止戰時空襲剛剛裝起來的「遮窗　」，我連忙跑過去關上牠，一面道着歉。</p>
<p>「原諒我的打擾。晚安」！</p>
<p>「原諒我的疏忽。晚安」！聽着下樓梯的脚步聲，我方悟　房　一夜有幾回是起來巡視各房間的燈光是否遮好的，這樣的時候，往往有一種不安的感覺，　　襲擊着我，以致　在凝　裏，好幾分鐘住了筆。</p>
<p>另一件：</p>
<p>在研究院，博物院等門口，因爲出神地思索着，沒有注意到遇遭，剛剛要跨進去的時候，忽然肩上受了輕輕的一拍。</p>
<p>「……」我驚異地掉轉頭。</p>
<p>「對不起，先生，我相信你是帶着你的防毒面具？」一個至少有我兩倍高的巡警，灣着腰，俯着頭，臉上浮着我們年書上老壽星式的那種微笑。</p>
<p>「當然的」！我連忙開開了手提箱。</p>
<p>一瞥到塞在箱角上的防毒面具，他立刻替我關上了箱　，一面點點頭，有時舉手行了一個禮。「原諒我們的阻擋。謝謝你」！</p>
<p>「原諒我的沒有　在肩上。謝謝你」！</p>
<p>這樣的時候，也有一種肅然的感覺籠罩了我的心頭，好久不散，以致好半天書都看不下去。</p>
<p>也不知爲了什麽緣故，我總覺得，好像在什麽處所，這些瑣事與一切英國對內，對外的地位和措施之間，有着什麽關連似的。因而，一翻開當時的筆記，不由地，就會聯帶想到這兩件瑣事。</p>
<p>回到國內來，轉瞬已經三個月了。現在翻翻當時的筆記，有的已經失去了時間性，有的，需要再整理或充實一下。而需要大大修改的處所，當然也很多，這一兩個月來歐洲局勢的演變，表面上，似乎令人有點目眩，其實呢，即使從當時各種情勢研究起來，推論起來，都是必有的發展。我當時的筆記裏，有一部份正是關係到當時歐洲各國中立問題的。現在給牠起一個篇名，發表出來，以供大家的參考，因爲保留當時觀感的真象，一切都沒有改動。每篇下面當時附着的日期，也都沒有塗去。</p>
<p>（一）「中立」</p>
<p>我們回憶到上次所謂歐戰正式宣佈後的第二幕，是各第三國的紛紛對德宣戰，再看一看　次英法對德宣戰後各第三國的紛紛宣佈着着「中立」，則其間的不同處所，是非常之明顯地，一下子就可以體會出來了。</p>
<p>當然，隱在這鬧嚷嚷「中立」聲音的底裏的，是近來各方面的緊張外交活動：做着根本決定的，却是整個的國際形勢的推移。</p>
<p>英法在歐洲方面，他們基本態度是這樣：一貫的根本政策，是打算和德意妥協，以東歐南歐，北歐作爲德意勢力範圍爲交換條件，以獲取他們對自己海外殖民地不作威脅的保證，在這陣綫裏，同樣拉上西歐也是擁有海外廣大殖民地的荷蘭，比利時，另外搭上一個瑞士。可是，假如德意對這些東歐，南歐，或北歐各國的領土與獨立，露出侵害行爲時，英法當取什麽態度呢？這一點，要分兩個情形說，第一個情形，假如事先未得英法同意時，則當然表示反對；第二個情形，假如事先向英法取得默契，並提出相當交換條件時，那末，是也可以加以贊助的。前者的例子，像今年春天亞爾巴尼亞的受侵；後者的例子，最明顯的是捷克。不過，萬一德意直接威脅到英法自己的身上來時，英法對這些小國的希求是什麽呢？毫無問題的，是希望牠們對德意宣戰！在一意義上，你可以了解，這一次戰爭裏，所謂「協約國」（Allies）這一面，三國彼此間以內部關係：與其說是英法爲波瀾的受威脅，因而對德强硬，又因而就爆發了戰爭時，還不如說，波瀾因爲英法與德意間糾紛解除不了，而同時，又認爲無論如何，德國是不至對自己用兵的，所以，爲了希望利用這一情勢，得到向外擴張的滿足，因而，在但澤問題上，對德强硬到底，又因而，就爆發了戰爭。所以，在研究這一問題的時候，我們必須時時刻刻地緊記着戰時爆發的當時形勢，那是：（一）自始至終，德波妥協約門，並沒有關閉，一直到英法宣戰時爲止；（二）德意對英法最大的駭人聽聞的要求，雖然已經傳了很久，可是爲了牠們忙於收拾歐洲各小國，一直還沒有提出的機會；大概一等在歐洲事完，三年兩載，海軍已經擴張完成時，則，立刻會向英法提出來的要求是：平分世界殖民地！</p>
<p>再看德國方面。牠的一貫地藐視其他各民族和國家，一貫地認歐洲各小國臣服德意志是當然的結論，在這一點上，今天的德國執政者納粹黨人們，和二十五年前牠的執政者威廉皇帝之間，是並無區別的。不過，所不同的，在遂行他的野心的武器方面，希特拉比起威廉第二來，却多了兩個武器：一個是經濟的統制，另一，則是宣傳。這一回，當全世界的目光，都被希特拉侵波戰爭的火光血影吸引著當兒，在不聲不響裏，這時，大家却忽略了德國同時在進行着的，對另一些國家的經濟統制：牠包辦了羅馬尼亞的全部煤油，石油的出口，包辦了匈牙利，西班牙的全部農產品的銷路，又包辦了大部份南斯拉夫的牲畜和家禽的出口。比起這，更爲大家所忽略了的，却是德國宣傳的不斷猛襲。直到今天，歐洲各小國的情形是：一面對德國的軍力，在慄慄危懼着；另一面，那些主張親德意的內部法西斯性政黨的勢力，是一天一天地在昂起頭來了。這是說明什麽呢？這是說明在牠的下面，德國宣傳武器收了功效；在牠的上層，各小國國內的傳說親英法論，在受着動搖了。那末，牠們對這次戰爭的具體態度上，德國希冀的，是什麽呢？祗要德國沒有下大決心和英法決戰時，牠是希望牠們保守所謂「中立」的，那意思。是在替牠自己開着大大的原料進口和製造品出口的大門，使英法的海軍封鎖，變爲無效；同時，還希望牠們抵抗英法的封鎖，藉了「破壞中立」的名，挑撥牠們與英法之間的關係。如果一朝德國下大決心和英法決戰，那末，除了意大利和西班牙勢必參戰外，對其餘的各國，德國當然還是希望牠們「保守中立」，替德意作物品的轉送機關，不過那時爲了軍略的必要，也許荷蘭，比利時或瑞士等三國中有一國或一個以上的國家，要終於被牽了進去。至於在目前，德國的要人們，公開地以及機密地，侵波戰的前夜以及戰爭爆發後的這些天來，都在一再地，向牠們表示：「希望你們中立」；又說，「祗要英法尊重你們的中立，德國也絕對尊重之」。</p>
<p>將英法爲一面德國爲一面的兩方態度一對照，到這裏，我們可以粗粗地有了一個結論：各國的「中立」在英法，是不利的；在德國則是固定的計劃，而且是理想的結果。——還要贅上一句：這裏我所用的「中立」字樣，是絕對的是抽象的，並不受其他條件的影響。比如說，假如任何小國參戰的話，縱使牠參戰的一邊，是在德國那一面，而與英法爲敵，其結果呢，還是與英法有利。與德國不利；反過來却對德有利，對英法爲不利了。如果用實例，我們不妨隨便舉出一個國家：假如保加利亞（或者南斯拉夫）參戰助德的話，形勢怎樣，那樣情勢下，首先在兩方軍力對比上，並無很大的變動；可是其次，第一，英，法可以立刻封鎖黑海（或亞得利亞海）中的，牠的一切進口出口貨物，第二，英，法軍隊可以立刻在牠境內登岸，通過羅馬尼亞，去援助波瀾，把東，西兩戰塲打爲一氣。</p>
<p>所以，這些時來，德國外交和宣傳兩方面所做的工作，是所謂一衝突地方化。「英，法方面的工作呢，却是：「憑着人道的名義，」也在「希望着衝突的地域，有所限制；」不過，憑了戰略的名義，——雖然沒有說出來——牠們事實上却向戰場擴大的那一方向，眺望着，而且慢慢進行着。</p>
<p>可是，事實揭曉出來，却是普遍「嚴守中立的」的聲音——（九月十六日於倫敦）</p>

<h3>外幣升降不一</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市况、烚赤盤旋略堅、英美金鎊因亦回起一元、英金票供求均勻、市價站穩、美金票始因紐約市塲之英鎊一再下趨、晨開略高至十八元八角、嗣因黑市外滙頻鬆、賣氣又盛、卒爲十八元五角半、比上日軋跌五分、香港票隨港滬滙兌續降三分、坎拿大票梢有需要、市價略漲、日金票及朝鮮票、各方供塞小絕、市價一致趨疲、前者退爲一元一角三分、後者退爲九角四分、</p>
<h3>金巿欲跌又止　一度進六千元大關</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、欲跌不能、市面恍惚、尤以午盤走勢靡定、高低互見、晨開僅六千零三十元、乃外匯開出續硬所致、繼有散戶及錢兌業絡繹吐塞、霎時退入六千元大關、慘告五千九百四十元、忽因某證券帮多頭乘賤猛吸、銀號帮在扒、時外滙亦略轉軟、於買戶維持之下、重告回出六千元大關、且升達六千一百五十元高價、惟前述某證券帮立意不堅、不久吐售、並錢兌業等俱來拋賣、復跌至六千零　十元、午收爲六千零九十五元、後市爲狀、靜中堅穩、初開六千二百元、買賣膠持、　銀號錢兌業肯放出拋空、曾降二十餘元、然某銀號進意甚殷、收盤前再漲爲六千一百二十元、而結果終告六千一百元、較隔昨尚好二十元、全天交易約三千數百兩、銀樓飾金掛高十元、海關金等仍平、</p>
<p>烚赤軋漲念元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初以外匯鬆硬、人心軟弱、開時大衆賣出、乃金號出銀號十兩、爲六千零三十元、較前收撳小五十元、繼因賣風仍濃、而進者奇少、立破入六千元大關、某戶出金號二十兩、遂爲五千九百四十元、後以某證券帮見賤在吸、且斯時滙市已告轉緊、銀號帮亦跟之猛拖、而拋空者見　紛起抵補、猛跳二百十元、銀號出同業共五十兩、爲六千一百五十元、　某　券帮多頭獲利出籠、而某銀號及錢兌業亦互相力吐、市勢復疲、證券帮金號各出錢兌業十兩、均爲六千零五十元、十一時後金號帮忽來競扒、某錢兌業亦傾向吸收、重又回升七十元、銀號出證券帮二十兩、爲六千一百二十元、午刻買者漸少、金號銀號帮吐出、再父步降二十五元、金號出錢兌業五十兩、爲六千零九十五元作午收價、午後開市略高五元、銀號進錢兌業十兩、爲六千一百元、隔手金號對做十兩、爲六千一百零五元、後錢兌業銀號賣出、步挫二十五元、金號出銀號十兩、爲六千零八十元、旋因另一銀號頻吸、且證券帮亦有扒進、未幾提升四十元、證券帮進銀號　兩、爲六千一百二十元、入後某銀號反來復吐、而散戶亦售、遂回落二十元、銀號互做十兩、爲六千一百元、作晚收價、結果比上日軋漲二十元、全天二百十元上落、現金號之本脾金售出價、照烚赤較高十數元、收進减低三十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十餘元、均鮮做開、銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、初時</p>

<h3>煤炭　鴻基屑削盤</h3>
<p>鴻基白煤塊、自日昨做高以來、惟鴻基二號白煤屑、因係製造煤球原料、經各小煤球廠一再請求、即日起義泰興、大隆興、同業行拆、酌量减低、計開碼頭過駁、每噸一百二十元、送到另加車力、照前已减去十四元行情云、</p>
<h3>藥材　益智仁隨到隨開　此前好起五六十元</h3>
<p>益智仁以來源久寂、市間頗覺缺乏、聞最近由瓊州運到數件、隨即開通、成交爲二百二十元、較之前市、漲起五六十元、苟後無續到、尚看再升、</p>
<h3>糧食　洋米不斷到滬</h3>
<p>米巿昨晨因承上日之疲勢、人心尙虛、零　銷塲旣滯、而投機者更紛紛出籠、各色洋米行情　貶三五角、若小紋衹開五十元左右、東京　尖四十九元半、轉　因原根客販之始終　持不說、而杭紹甬幫突父乘廉活動、兼之鄉莊客戶與本街店胃以明後九十兩日端節結束帳款、期米市塲休業無市、爲謀未雨綢繆計、預爲添備、追踪暢辦、一時需要頓繁、在多方拽求之下、造成賣方之良機、一遇問津、喊聲迭起、於是市面即反疲還緊、</p>
<p>洋米昨晨一度平軟後、即被杭嘉與各內地幫趁平添辦、而建源接洽之暹米二千噸、亦因定額問題未妥、市面即在客囤復活中抬高元外、旋因合義洋行又照前價减小一角、爲五十九元八角、售出六月下七百五十噸、其他亦有接洽、市乃始見回平、午後升降不一、晚收則仍比前晚較大五六角至七八角不等、惟最近成交暹邏米等已近十萬包、接洽迄未中止、如匯水小縮、勢必源源　來、則後市未必再見騰漲、</p>
<p>又訊、洋米又有大量到滬、昨日太古公司穎州輪到埠、自港運來九千九百包、又瓊州輪同時抵滬、亦由香港裝來八千九白零七包昨日共到一萬八千八百零七包、兩輪分靠於法租界本行一二兩號碼頭、昨日下午二時起、船上起卸貨之工人罷工、故昨日未能起卸、</p>
<p>粳糯國米、糯米雖昨續到五六車、但粳貨以產地售價上漲、與滬市難合、致傳聞塲外暗盤成交雖寥、而售意殊堅、悉守原盤、糯米早市亦軟、後因洋米回昂、相隨轉緊、結果先後售價堪稱定局、計金溧特元四十六元八角至四十六元半、常丹白元四十五六元、江北白元四十三四　、</p>
<h3>粉麵客銷減退　因裝運頗多困難</h3>
<p>日昨粉巿仍趨堅挺之局、惟客銷已較前兩日爲减、因裝　殊多困難、故新交易漸形呆懈、本街零批交易約計六千包、各廠爲維持性質、仍照十三元八角原盤、除供給日常需用外、均不願多量供給、內地粉亦以存到兩枯、供求兩寂、聞內地產價須十四元以上、故來源一時無望、市面因此沉靜、市面開展、且待新麥上市之秋耳、又麵粉昨日有五萬元千包運往泉州、今日有一千三百六十二包運往烟台、</p>
<h3>證劵　內債漲跌互見　外股跌風未戢</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨日市况又入於盤旋漲跌不等之象、丙種始終在五十元關口左右盤旋、多方欲乘低買進、空方欲乘高賣出、雙方互不相讓、市價愈無波動、戊種明日舉行抽籤、此後則輪到八月係甲種第十次抽籤、故甲種行市獨强、數日來漲起一元七八角之多、各債亦以利息迫近、賣戶亦逐見稀少、昨日交易、上午協大益昌頗有吸收、鴻康及十六號三十八號等稍有供出、市况均衡、午後義泰同順益昌大通等買進、潤利聯和及散戶賣出、市價比較稍稍回堅、但結果仍係高低互見、爲數祇一二角而已、成交數約七十餘萬元、茲列簡明表於後</p>
<p>股票交易、成交交通銀行股三十股、價為六十七元七角半、</p>
<p>衆業股市、人心復現猶豫、對於戰事消息之期待、尤甚於商業興趣之激發、全日交易衹十四萬四千股、價格一致下游、英聆股較前收跌一元七角五、會　　小二元、墾殖八角、怡和二元二角半、國際上海揚子前收各爲十三元三角、十四元三角、贊九元三角、昨收衹十一元　角、十三元一角、及八元六角半</p>
<p>地產股票中、中營股水嘗有何變動、中和股退去數角爲十四元六角、業廣亦略跌而爲十元、華懋股二元半有人賣出、</p>
<p>橡皮股較有人問津、但在價格减低後、始能招致買方購吸、</p>
<p>倫敦五日（週三）電、今日中國外債掛牌行市仍告平穩、上下檔各債券、概無變動、</p>
<p>倫敦五日（週三）電、今日英商遠　各公司股票掛牌行市、略有疲落、上海自來水A種股跌一鎊、價爲十四鎊、保安保險股跌三鎊、價爲二十五鎊、其餘不動、</p>
<h3>紗花　期紗交割成問題　本紗跌風仍烈</h3>
<p>紗市續疲、且跌風仍烈、此因外滙寗謐、海外棉市無起色之望、兼之某紗交割問題、尚無相富辦法、現紗售價步步下降、於是華紗間接受其　脅、因之多頭灰心而吐出、市盤乃不穩矣、</p>
<p>現紗晨間人氣仍虛弱、塲中買戶寥寥、二十支雙馬價爲一千三百元、旋聞外滙開出、無大變化、賣氣忽濃、市價步步下落、至一千二百六十元、市塲忽傳蘇俄加人聯軍陣綫買聲稍振、又回至一千二百八十元、收盤略疲、結果二十支雙馬行情跌三十六元、查半日間成交統計一千四白四十五包、今日有紗一百二十件運烟台、一千七百十件運天津、又昨日有四百三十二件運泉州、茲將各帮口買去之額量、分列如左、</p>
<p>同行　一·〇三〇　香港　四一五</p>
<p>統計　一·四四五</p>
<h3>紗價不穩　棉巿更疲</h3>
<p>本棉交易、異常靜寂、此內印美棉市在大跌小漲中、加之紗價不穩、所以人心渙散、廠方束手勿動、市態更疲、茲將現棉成交情形列左、</p>
<p>大中集二四二·〇〇　同行進一〇〇包</p>
<p>康江花二〇二·〇〇　同行進一〇〇件</p>
<p>米特林二九二·〇〇　同行進一〇〇件</p>
<p>又　二九八·〇〇　新裕進一〇〇件</p>
<p>另訊外棉市價、紐約棉巿、日來殊無起色、先因市上缺乏重要之買戶、後因華爾街股票價格之低落、及一部份現貨之賣出、結果收盤價格、近期平平、遠期降落七八磅音印度市况已趨穩定狀態、昨日　同預測漲一羅比、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、近日未見鬆動、天津帮雖間　略有交易、然爲數不巨、故未能影響市况也、茲將昨日棉市以美滙五元三一二五折合期棉送廠價如下、</p>
<p>二十支　美米特林　三一六·九五</p>
<p>又　又　下級　三〇七·〇</p>
<p>三十二支　又　三二五·〇〇</p>
<p>又　又　下級　三二四·一〇</p>
<p>四十二支　又　三三八·九〇</p>
<p>又　又　下級　三二九·八〇</p>
<h3>疋頭　府綢洋紗漂布　交易絕盛</h3>
<p>國布　市况近日各路現銷漸見發展、惟以囤貨擱置數量甚巨、昨遭紗價下跌影響、人氣虛怯、小額浮囤售盤最鬆、故大市雖屬平穩、而一部份散額粗細布及漂染布每疋跌二角半至五角、客方又抱觀望態度、交易銳减、本街成交組布坯布一百餘件、本外埠零疋批發生意成交三千餘疋、以當令府綢洋紗漂布居多、客帮粵銷較旺辦色布色斜一百數十件、川滇帮辦藍布　貨四五十箱、</p>
<p>東布　疲滯如故、售盤續降、龍頭細布晨開僅三十九元五角、後市回升至四十元〇二角半、四君子嗶嘰一度跌至一元〇二分半、收盤爲一元〇三分半、中檔雜牌細布較前日又跌每疋一元外、形勢殊　、</p>
<h3>法西襯上升</h3>
<p>昨日呢羢大盤行情仍堅、各貨趨勢悉多優秀、交易零躉皆盛、法西襯市面、刻均見軋情、蓋其舶品東貨多已斷檔、西貨愛二七七未有進口、市存有限、國產本廠貨除洪盛　二八八與寅豐一四七〇外、餘無出品、現貨供不敷求、標準即行升漲矣、昨愛二七七法西襯　碼現批售二　淨盤、二八八售一元四角、一四七〇售一元〇五分、</p>
<h3>派列斯條子最俏</h3>
<p>派列斯正値　銷之時、中西裝衣着走銷皆廣、所銷則以條子等花色貨爲最俏、市盤因之見漲、素色似較平疲、其出路雖亦繁盛、而其供給充斥、致雜能　升、查素色派列斯、目下祇門莊店中裝衣料爲旺銷、條子花色派列斯、中西裝需要均股、而其運到及本廠出品、則素色反多於條子、市况隨造成條子俏漲、而素色平淡矣、查近市條子與素色派列斯、大路躉批現交、每碼平均高低相差一二元不等</p>
<h3>絲茶　海外絲價下降　錫繭竟過五百元</h3>
<p>國外絲　、因受上月份紐約生絲實銷慘淡之刺激、日美均一致下降、計日絲八三分七五分各跌四分、中國絲各跌三分、紐約近遠期各跌二分半、橫濱現貨跌四十元、遠期跌二十三元、上海絲交沉寂、絲本旣巨、洋行吃價又回、內外絲價相距甚大、故無成交、</p>
<p>無錫繭市、因各小絲廠五抬行盤放價、改良鮮繭、每担竟過五百元、是故「華中」不易購得原料、乃於前日「飭令」停秤、以期壓低蘭價、</p>
<p>人造絲前日有二十包、由太古公司頴州輪自香港裝來、今日本市原有人造絲四百五十餘包、裝太古公司湖南輪、運往天津、因船上起卸貨工人罷工、恐今日不能運出、（祖）</p>
<h3>綠茶歐銷仍滯</h3>
<p>昨日洋莊綠茶市况、各歐莊均以國際風雲日惡、進意非常消極、抽芯珍眉綠茶、因國外來電、並不急需、一星期來幾無交易、昨市僅協和間孚杜德等行、買進普通珍　及細針等貨、共計一百六十餘箱、珍眉售價三百六十五元、細針售價自九十五元至一百零五元、與前均無變動、</p>
<p>又茶葉昨由香港來七百七十件、另由寗波來三十六件、由　州來二千三百二十二件、今日有八十件、運往烟台、又有六百零五件、運往天津、</p>
<h3>糖巿　洋糖續鬆</h3>
<p>昨搪市續鬆、公會劃盤、二四粗白現貨本棧七十一元、下午七十一元半、外棧貨起伏不定、初爲七十元、後退半元、再回至七十一元、下午七十元八角、計跌四角、轉口貨五十七元二角至五角、下午亦五十七元半、太古車白B嘜八十二元半、跌七角、H嘜赤五十八元半、荷赤六十元半、均降五角、本廠寫白七十一元、小二元、本廠冰九十二元半、晶明冰九十四元、均見下游、又糖昨由香港二千九百三十七包、</p>
<h3>南北貨　金針菜改售現鈔</h3>
<p>金針菜向以匯　交易、邇來以貼現升降無定、致售價方國頗感不便、昨由鎮江帮做開中與菜一批、成盤爲現鈔三十七　五角、</p>
<h3>海味　西海參到銷相埒</h3>
<p>西洋海參邇來到銷相埒、勢亦穩定、昨日又售開一批、計赤參揀條二百二十元、出辦二百零四元、一號赤一百八十六元、二號一百七十六元、三號一百五十二元、四號一百二十六元、玉參揀條三百四十六元、出辦三百五十九元、一號玉三百五十元、二號三百三十九元、三號三百二十九元、四號三百二十八元、五號三百十三元、中玉二百零九元、</p>

<h3>法大使正式声明　未與美當局談判　所謂託管租界毫無根據日又謠傳德使奔走和平　新新公司否認出售日方之消息</h3>
<p>哈瓦斯社本埠消息、法國駐華大使館、頃發出聲明如次、若干時來、中國境內傳開上海法國當局、正與　國當局進行秘密談判、擬以法租界行政權與警察權、暫時移交美國當局法國駐華大使館對於此項謠傳、茲特堅決予以否認、美國合衆社本埠六日訊、上海美法當局今日復否認日本方面謠傳法國擬將上海法租界移交美國之消息、美國當局聲稱、彼等對於該項建議、一無所聞、法方發言人聲稱、「該項謠言、毫無根據、」</p>
<p>東京方面認真作態</p>
<p>美國合衆社東京六日電、日今日載稱、日本政府「重視」上海方面日人所載關於法國擬將上海法租界權利栘交美國之消息日本報章暗示、日本外務省鑒於日本爲「東亞之安定勢力」、擬向法國兩國提出抗議、頃聞與亞院已注意上海方面傳來消息、但日報未載上海美法兩國官員之否認、據與亞院發表之正式文告云、法國須與「汪政權」接洽、并將法租界移交「南京政權云、日本海軍發言人金潭少將、今日亦在招待新聞記者席上聲稱「倘法國真欲將上海法租界移交美國、則日本政府對此不能忽視、」</p>
<p>又復謠傳　德使歸國</p>
<p>日方自戰事趨於逆境、一再敗北以後、即轉移目標、致力於所謂「謠言攻勢」之佈置、英法美三國大使進行和議之說散播於前、羅馬方面傳佈「和平」之訊於後、但謠　無根、</p>
<p>自生自滅</p>
<p>不旋踵間、往往爲事實所廊清、最近上海日文報紙於造作「美國撤退駐軍」「法租界警權移交美國」等等　言以後、前（五日）之日文大陸新報上、竟又刊佈德駐華大使裴沙將於最近期內返德之訊、並稱「此行與中日議和事有關」云云、大中社記者特於昨日以此事叩詢於</p>
<p>德大使館</p>
<p>駐滬辦事處之負責人、證　此種消息、又屬完全無稽、據辦事處負責人稱、「德駐華大使裴沙、絕無離滬返國之舉、日文報紙或係將最近德駐華大使館曅德（Bidde）君返德之誤傳、」足證其造謠之技窮、</p>
<p>荷輪未由美艦護送</p>
<p>昨日日方同盟社又稱日前有荷輪一艘、由一美艦護送來滬、於本星期二抵埠云云、當由此間美國亞洲艦隊參謀官某員予以否認、當經指出、星期二日、並無美國海軍艦隻抵滬云、據觀察者稱、日方一再虛構事實、散播種種無稽謠言、　屬有計劃的而別有用心、</p>
<p>新新公司否認出讓</p>
<p>日方昨又傳本埠新新公司、將出日方以三千萬元收買、並謂雙方刻已進行談判、但昨日新新公司當局、業已正式否認、據該公司當局　大中社記者稱、此項消息、全係無稽之談、新新公司既從未召盤、而日方及其他方面、亦從未向公司方面</p>
<p>要求收買</p>
<p>也按此項消息、於四月二日、亦會見日文每日新聞、該公司即於四月四日刊登聲明於本埠各華文報紙、聲稱、此事絕　不確、不意時隔一月、竟又捏造此同樣之消息、該公司之資金、總額爲三百萬元、而目前之營業、且較前爲佳云、日方</p>
<p>捏造謠言</p>
<p>之動機、殊難臆測、　該公司當局、亦表示難加說明、但該公司營業部則表示、日方此舉、　係因日本商人、亟欲在滬謀其貨物傾銷之根據地、又據探悉、二月前日方首次宣佈購買新公司之消息後、日文報紙即數度</p>
<p>予此披露</p>
<p>並加渲染、昨日日方又稱、「日方購買新新公司之談判、已有　著之進步、據可靠方面探悉、日方現已　以日元二千五百萬、購買其建築物所有物及設備、而公司方面、則非日金三千萬元不辦、」</p>
<h3>長城保險公司　開業盛況</h3>
<p>長城保險公司爲本市金融界實業界諸領袖所組織、呈請經濟部核准設立、延聘保險專家管理、昨日開幕、各界前往道賀者、絡繹不絕、一日中接受各大國貨廠商及銀行錢莊投保額、爲數至鉅、該公司營業方針、除全力承保當地國人產業外、又鑒於南洋華島及荷屬東印度等僑胞衆多、故將前往設立分公司、</p>
<h3>美實行禁運　日當局感不安　美國目的在於消弭戰禍　日竟以南進計劃相恫嚇</h3>
<p>據外人方面消息、美國政府於本月三日通知日本當局、已發出命令、禁止一切對於實現本國擴軍計劃所需要之原料、運往外國、東京方面獲訊後、極為震恐、蓋此次禁運範圍、較前更為廣泛、日本首當其衝、影響至大、眾信此次美國當局於日機最近</p>
<p>空襲重慶、與納粹德國在比利時及法國北部之活動取得呼應、至為不滿、故決定採取此項行動、警誡日本、又從華盛頓傳來之私人訊息、稱美國當局以後將不再向日本送達任何警告這外交文書、決定使日本就範、而其目的並不在於發動戰爭而在於消弭戰禍、美國民意、一致主張向日本實施經濟制裁之時機已至、日本如再橫行無忌、則其將獲最不利之後果、可無疑義、但東京方面日軍某要員向外籍記者表示、倘西方各國拒絕供給原料於日本、日本必將實現其南進計劃云云、日方不知悔禍、一味向列強恫嚇、居心殊屬叵測也、</p>
<h3>金融界潛勢　未可樂觀</h3>
<p>節關放款　特予慎重</p>
<p>滬工商業之端節結賬將屆、各業對放出之客賬、已分別派員催收、銀錢兩業收解繁忙、四行聯合辦事處上海分行、竭力調劑同業金融、務使金融得以持久穩定、各行莊等、決定於端節（六月十日）循例休假一天、並鑒於上海之金融表面上異常穩定、而潛勢實有未可樂觀、且活定期存款之比、活期竟佔百分之廿十之多而趨勢增加、蓋自今上海資金之所有者、競以投機操縱為目的、資金之利用、端在有隨時應付之便、庶有暴利可求、區區定期存息、寗在意計之中、自惟有相率趨於活期之途、待機而動乘機而用、所以各行莊對於一切放款、不得不予慎重、防止投機操縱、</p>

<p>定海石碶　米荒慘狀</p>
<p>據定海來客談、該縣孤　海外、集島成治、全境多山少田、產米甚少、民食所需、素賴外縣接濟、自縣城淪陷後、城內因交通斷絕、米價高漲、鄉郊各地、則經縣府統籌調整、得形壓平、惟近來因各地糧價飛漲影響、故城內米價、每担已達七十三元之巨、創空前未百之新紀錄東鄉及各海島等地、亦達五十元左右、食糧恐慌、日益嚴重、</p>

<h3>法租界納華人會　警告投機壟斷　滬巿商民均應本位救國　外滙平準基金確屬雄厚</h3>
<p>法租界納稅華人會警吿界內商民云、溯目五月初旬、本市金融突起騷動、外滙暴縮、市况混亂、多數商鋪、假此藉口、競抬物價、一日數漲、漫無止境、然試一究其抬價貨物、皆屬事先所進、其與外匯暴縮、風馬牛不相關、昭昭阴甚、及今外匯回鬆、市塲安定、而往日加價貨物之恢復原狀者、可謂絕無僅見、則抬高物價、顯屬投機性質、希圖非份利得、人所共知、天商人將本求利、固不足誹議、然僅以利慾爲先、敲骨吸髓、祇圖自肥而置民衆於溝堅、視社會安全若無覩、荒謬絕倫、令人切齒、際此非常時　、諸事維難、凡吾國人、應各認消目標、至少必須造成本位救國之地位、商人之本位救國云何、不壟斷、不居奇、不投機、不抬價是也、不壟斷居奇、不投機抬價、是非奸商、非社會罪人、不愧爲黃帝之皇皇華胄也、茲悉本市租界當局、對於壟斷居奇、投機抬價者、訂有嚴厲制裁法則、即將施行、用敢掬誠吿誡、凡吾界內全體商民、應即猛省、自相惕勵、將所抬物價、恢復五月以前原狀、切勿以身試法、漠然置之、實深企翹之至、</p>
<p>平準基金</p>
<p>據法文上海日報云、依一般人之所知、外匯平準基金委員會、確尙握有二百萬鎊或二百五十萬鎊以上之外匯、足以壓制投機者、不能在六月份間、過於興風作浪、據市塲上之估計、本埠尚有一千二百萬元之美金游資、在市面流轉、現聞此款、計在外匯平準基金會手中者、有五百萬元美金、在各銀行手中者、有三百萬元美金、其在投機者手中者、則僅有四百萬元美金也、依此推測、如各銀行不爲投機者之助、則投機者聲勢已弱、而平準會之基金、又復極其雄厚、如無出人意表之謠言、則在六月份內、本埠之外匯市塲、當可穩定、蓋投機者在此環境、勢必歛跡、而不敢任意橫行、</p>
<p>嚴查米蠹</p>
<p>本巿整個米巿、自經各米業團體設法整頓後、同業買賣已漸入正軌、僅米棧存底一項、據豆米業公會稱、現在一百萬包以上、雖際此靑黃不接之時、然滬市米價或可轉趨鬆懈、其原因不外氣候轉熱、棧貨易起變化、故各大戶已無意再行扒吸、現各有關米業團體對於轉輾買賣、從中漁利者、決將嚴厲取締、以輕各該行號負擔、頃甫在洽商中、一俟就緒、即公佈市塲、予以實行</p>
<p>外滙停止掉期觀感</p>
<p>最近出版之英文金融商業報載稱、自上週間中外銀行、宣布停止外匯掉期後、市塲曾發生混亂、照中外各銀行宣布之辦法、以後除銀行相互間之拆做、或正當商業之交易外、對投機份子之外匯掉期、一致拒絕、此項措置、多數人之見解、以爲各銀行此舉、係徇平準委員會之請、目的在</p>
<p>取締投機</p>
<p>安定匯市、原則上自當爲大衆所贊同、蓋平準基金之設立、反　人用爲攻擊匯市、使投機份子之損失機會减至極少限度、盈餘之希望則無限度、實際上等於獎勵投機、在平時投機爲進出之兩面作法、（有購進亦有拋售）尚無須力加糾正、但在現時投機之行動均趨於一面、自有予以料正之必要、但現今採取之拒絕外匯掉期辦法、是否能達預期之目的、</p>
<p>似未可必</p>
<p>外匯掉期在商業上亦有其需要、但與投機上需要比較、不過滄海之一栗、若干銀行對於掉期交易、凡能提出商號名稱、表明爲正當商業用途香、均予通融辦理、自與拒絕掉期交易之原旨相悖、即使各銀打嚴格遵行拒絕掉期、亦不難以同時賣買期貨之方法、爲顧客轉期、祇須匯率差額英金不低於三十二分之一、美金不低於十六分之一、其結果不過爲經紀人</p>
<p>增多交易</p>
<p>而已、某銀行家曾表示意見、據稱、何以銀行之一般存戶、不能利用其銀行中之存款爲外匯之套利、此種套利常在週息五分六分左右、甚少風險、何以存戶僅能以現款存入銀行、使銀行利用存款經營套利、新辦法僅能打擊資力薄弱之投機份子、對大戶則難有何效果、此種論調、實誤解平準會之原意、惟吾人小能忘却上海銀行衆多</p>
<p>經營範圍</p>
<p>亦不一致、其經營存款放款之正常業務者、自願見投機之消滅、但亦有以投機爲業之銀行、一旦不能實行投機之伎倆、其本身自必隨之倒閉、吾人所聞、掉期交易原則雖已取消、但市塲變更甚少、掉期依然便利、不過無此名目而已、賣出買進僅隔三分鐘、市上有表示絕對遵守隨章者、其賣買均分別銀行辦理、故市塲人士均爲滿意、實際情形依然如常云、</p>

<h3>老公茂保險部買辦　陳上達被綁架　匪徒事先刦用雲機汽車　綁架後向滬西疾駛而逸</h3>
<p>愛文義路張家宅、於昨晨八時三十分許忽發生綁票案、被綁者係本埠老公茂康記保險部買辦陳上達、架上雲飛出差汽車、向西疾馳而逸、茲將詳情探誌於次、</p>
<p>赴行辦公</p>
<p>甬藉慈谿人陳上達、現年五十二歲、庽愛文義路張家宅七十三弄六十號、向在廣東路十七號英商老公茂康記保險部爲買辦、已歷十有餘年、當陳少時、曾爲該行練習生、因辦事勤奮、始升爲職員、繼爲買辦、現出人乘坐一七九九號包車代步、包車夫爲江北人裴世松（年三十七歲）、於昨晨八時三十　左起、　　　起行　公、由張家宅拉出至友華汽車行門口、詎路側停有一二三四四號被匪所刦之雲飛出差汽車一輛、瞥見陳之包車行近、車上匪徒、亦撥動引擎、蠕蠕而動、兩車並行、</p>
<p>架登汽車</p>
<p>不料車抵愛文義　口時、右面路側另閃出匪徒二名、用手攔住包車車槓、左側又有御長衫者、出示手槍、一面將包車夫裴世松披摑一下、威脅停駛、裴因懾於淫威、遂放下車槓、呆立於側、當被一匪脚踢、令其速去、隨將陳拖下包車、架登一二三四四號汽車、向西逸去、</p>
<p>匪逸無踪</p>
<p>出事後、包車夫裴世松亟奔回其家、據情報吿其家屬、轉報新閘捕房派大批中西探捕馳往、奈匪已杳如黃鶴、現捕房正在跴緝中、據悉一二八前、陳寓居閘北早橋附近、嗣遷入該處、生有子女七口、幼子尚在襁褓中、因食指浩繁、並無積蓄、聞陳月得薪水三百元、徒有虛名、毫無實際、</p>
<p>刦車經過</p>
<p>又悉靜安寺路雲飛汽車分站、於昨晨六時卅分許、突來一顧客、當由汽車夫談毛弟（年四十八歲本地人）駕駛一二三四四號汽車、駛抵梵王渡靑年小學弄口、該顧客喝令將車掉頭停止、囑隨同入弄取箱子一隻、談不疑有他、乃跟踪進內、詎行未　武、弄內竄出短衣者四名、兩人持有搶械、禁止聲張、遂將其號衣褫去、由另一匪穿上、</p>
<p>事後交還</p>
<p>適該處後面毘連兆豐花園、隨有三人將其監視、伴遊於花園中、其餘兩人、將車架去、逾二時半許、該車始返回原處、入園會晤三匪後乃語汽車夫云、該車在惇信路、自去　回、此時談脫樊籠、亟至該處、果見停有原車、遂開回車行、立即據情投報捕房、按該汽車即係匪徒用以綁架陳上達者、</p>
<h3>肥皂內　隱藏烟土</h3>
<p>中央捕房禁毒部華探目劉兆年、得綫人報吿、謂有販土犯將於昨晨七時半經過麥根路武定路附近、自帶有多量烟土、乃協同華探長葉毓泗·探員郭守信·王樹森等、準時前往守候、果見有靑浦人姚寳興、手携肥皂兩大條、迎面而來、形跡可疑、乃將逮捕、在該特製之肥皂內、抄出烟土二十八兩、價值千餘元、帶入新閘房收押、候解送特一院訊辦、</p>

<h3>西湖近事</h3>
<p>杭垣之西湖，亦名西子湖，又名金牛湖，風景之佳，著名中外，其中之三潭映月，為十景之一，風亭水榭，碧檻紅闌，環以藕池，通以略彴，為消夏第一佳處。兵燹後，經前方伯湘鄉蔣公，重為修茸，規模較前宏整焉。其地之東，由小橋迤邐而入，則為退省菴，乃彭雪琴宮保之別墅。宮保於巡江閱武之暇，必過此小住月餘。蓋前曾奏明朝廷，乞以為養疴之所，如賀季真之鑑湖一曲也。時前河南學政德清俞蔭甫，掌勃詁經精舍，舍中肄業生醵金鳩工於講舍之東，創建俞樓，以為公來省時憇息之地，於去冬始得吿成。先生於前月詣杭開課，從諸弟子之請，置榻其中。其地背山面水，全湖在目，足點一湖之勝。宮保方在退省菴養靜，聞先生至，欣然鼓棹而來，先生亦時往訪；蓋兩地相去只一蘇隄之隔，命車呼櫂，往返皆便。艷之者皆謂文昌文曲，隔水相望，真如南北兩峯並峙矣。宮保於前月二十三日起程，先生亦於是日返舟蘇垣矣。</p>

<h3>救護生命（二）</h3>
<p>然而我們須知道，基督並未曾說，凡一切屬世的情事其本質是不好的。他並未曾指斥世人，不應有家庭，愛，快樂，藝術，美麗，科學，知識，以及其他與人生有關的種種活動。也並未吩咐人拒絕這一切的活動。他乃是吿訴我們：世人若以這些事情爲人生的最大目的，反倒會把這一切喪掉了。反過來，世人不爲這一切的事情所役，却爲基督和他的福　的緣故，甘願喪失這一切，倒能救護牠們。這實在是一種顚撲不破的眞理。某君嘗說，「我是一個基督徒，因爲做基督徒十分有趣。」這話說的不錯。平常不虔奉宗敎的人，看人生爲枯　無味，其實並不是人生如此，乃是他們沉溺于酒色，影戲，和跳舞等方面去，把生命喪掉了，所以他們看人生枯　無味。基督徒却不是這樣的，他看人生爲最有趣，因爲他相信他的所爲所產生的結果，決不致及身而沒，乃要影響到後世。他看自己的生命，爲一種戲劇，上帝和天使都是觀看者，他演到得意之處，上帝卽爲他歡喜，演到失意之處，上帝亦爲他悲傷。他看自己一切的活動，都有一種高尙的意義。他把藝術和美麗獻給上帝，爲贊美和敬拜上帝之用。他看知識和科學，爲證明上帝的大智大能的確證。他看上帝是愛的本源，光明，眞理，權能和生命的本源，所以他的人生觀，是充滿了興趣的。總而言之，基督所說的這句話，實在有顚撲不破的眞理。我們若爲自己的緣故，去尋求娛樂等等，結果，我們不但得不着娛樂的眞幸福，反倒會使精神上受痛苦，喪掉原有的生命。若爲義督的緣故，犧牲我們的幸福，結果，我們不但能救護原有的一切，更是能得着新興趣，新快樂，新希望—新生命。（完）</p>

<h3>電話荒</h3>
<p>— 前車</p>
<p>因爲電話機的求過於供？發現了「出頂電話」的新事業，且每架達二三千元之巨。電話公司當局雖然刊登廣告，嚴厲取締，却爲了都是私下授受，無法禁止，並且因之而發生更甚的弊端。因爲賣買雙方成交之後，電話機的「喬遷」還是要經過公司的手續的，於是，甚至原戶的電話因遷居而拆搬電話機時，也要勒索巨款了。昨犬的本報本埠新聞欄中就載着一條破獲勒款之案件，其中多數被吿就是該公司的職員。</p>
<p>私下授受電話是越出電話公司的章程的，而電話公司的職員竟然利用了這弱點作爲勒索的機會，這小但是「欺騙敲詐」，而且是「助紂爲虐」，因爲電話公司的無法禁止「出頂電話」，大概就是在「喬遷」手續上出了毛病。以後公司當局祇要注　請求遷拆電話機時，加以調查，是否是「原戶電話」或是「出頂電話」，比登廣吿要有力得多了。</p>
<p>同時筆者又想到了另一個問題，就是現在新機將到上海，聽說等到電話綫配備吿畢後，年內就可以裝置新機了。可是據一個請求裝置電話機的朋友前去登記後回來說：登記的戶名或許還要超出新機的數目，所以得請公司在事先把登記的先後（收款單有號碼的），調查淸楚，依次而行，否則在「先裝」與「後裝」之間，還是使那些不法之徒有從中漁利的機會。</p>
<h3>愛護圖書館書籍</h3>
<p>— 新夢</p>
<p>前幾大在本報上讀到一則新亞圖書館的啟事，大意說是近來該館所借出的書籍，時常發現被人毀損，如撕去幾頁，或任意在書上塗些評語等，使入防不勝防，這的確是一件痛心的事。</p>
<p>不僅是新亞圖書館，我們知道一般的圖書館發生過類似的事惰，尤　是在學校圖書館裏，當天的報紙一到，評論被人剪去了，副刋被人挖去了一個洞，不到半天，一份報紙已四分五裂，所剩無多。這雖然爲了私人的愛好，需要剪藏，但別忘了圖書館是公有的，不能爲你私自剪去，使別人讀小到。他如借書不還，在書上塗字句等，也常有發現。</p>
<p>公物每一個人應當愛護，尤其是書圖館裏的書報，更不應任意去毀損絲毫，這樣才能使大家都看到。因此，筆者要望上圖書館的人，或是向圖書館借書的人，每一個都能愛護書報，比自己的書報更要愛護。因爲你自己的書報，毀損了祇使你一個人受到影饗和損害，但毀壞了圖書館裏的書報，將使無數人受到影饗和損害。大家把這惡習除去才好呢！</p>
<h3>謾「戴」誨盜</h3>
<p>— 陳麟</p>
<p>執事先生：</p>
<p>今日上午九時許，我因有要事至八仙橋去，路過敏體尼蔭路寗波路口，見一個身穿印度綢旗袍的婦人，頭上燙髮，脚穿高跟皮鞋，手內攙了一個八九歲的男孩，後面跟着二個廿餘歲的男子，一個穿派　斯長衫，一個穿米色的西裝，都是頭戴呢帽，足登皮鞋，那婦人將行至轉灣的地方，忽見後面兩男子撲上，一個把其喉嚨及右手按住。一個把其左手上的鑽戒和手表搶去，後把婦人推倒在路上，他們却向西逸去。那婦人從地上爬了起來，口內在喊捉盜，但盜已影跡全無了。在旁的小孩，只是呆呆的立着大哭，在路看熱鬧的都擠攏上來，我就於嘈雜聲中走了</p>
<p>奉勸上海的士女們，現在市上竊盜很多，白天在路上竟也被搶，我們只有積儉樸素，不要以爲戴了美觀，出風頭而失去物件，還要受到驚嚇，你想値得嗎？</p>

<p>霍桑忙着把頭回到了正常狀態。「什麽話！—萬能？人誰是萬能？對不起，我可受不住。」霍桑連連搖着頭，臉上浮出不自在的慍色，嘴裏仍吐吸着紙烟。</p>
<p>霍桑本來不喜歡人家不合理的恭維，何况道「萬能」兩個字，更超越了恭維的限度。</p>
<p>安娜顫聲說：「霍先生，麗蘭死得很苦，又十分奇怪。你就是不爲酬報，爲着一個可憐女子的慘死，也得費一些心力，把這件案子的眞相查個明白。」</p>
<p>伊的聲音近乎哀求了。而且「奇怪」的字樣也打動了霍桑的好奇心。</p>
<p>霍桑正色答道：「好，我去看一看。伊在那裏？」</p>
<p>伊死在伊的家裏靑蒲路二十七號。伊家裏本來沒有一個親人。……眼前有一個伊的姑夫，叫李芝範。」</p>
<p>「是這個姑夫告訴你的嗎？」</p>
<p>「不，金梅打電話通報我的—金梅是麗蘭的女傭人。我一接到伊的電話，就趕得去。伊死得眞悽慘啊！」</p>
<p>霍桑把身子坐直了，兩指夾着紙烟，向我瞧瞧，似乎暗示我如果有意一塊兒去，必須立刻去換衣裳了。我覺得沒有向這姜安娜作什麽吿退表示的必要，便自顧自走出辦公室的鬥，到樓上去。我在上樓梯的時候，聽得安娜又在說話。　（七）</p>

<h3>富連成五科人才總檢閱（上）</h3>
<p>— 唯我</p>
<p>前奏　北平的當速　科班，是我國唯一的京劇演員養成所。當令的名伶，差不多都是富連成所敎養出來的。但二三十年來，從富運成出來的伶人；掛頭牌成大角兒的從喜，輩到世字輩，錄科却只有一個人，那就是：喜字輩的　喜福，連字輩的馬連良，富字輩的譚富英，盛字輩的李盛藻，和世字輩的毛世來了。最巧不過的，這五個人當中，倒有四個是唱老生的，只有未一科世字輩的毛世來是旦角。</p>
<p>據現在調查所得，富連成頭科喜字輩中人猶在演戲的，祇剩需喜福侯喜　陳喜星這三五個人。連字輩和當字輩的人，爲數也不多了。現在分散各班最多的是盛字世字兩科中人，盛宇輩中人，曾在滿師後，由李盛藻領銜來滬出演，故予滬人印象頗深。世字輩中人出科未久，來滬者不多，諒滬人必不詳細，因將該科所產生之諸人，作一統計如左：</p>
<p>生行　世字輩中以鬚生人才爲最多，其中年齡最長，最早露頭角者爲李世霖；　世霖習藝不久，即改應硬裏子。（此人去歲曾隨王玉蓉來滬）此後在　和樓（富連成演戲之戲館）演正工老生戲者，爲劉世勛，俞世龍，王世緒，此三人坐科時藝均不弱，人皆以他日之馬（運良）譚（富英）目之，其中尤以世勛世龍二人唱唸做表無一不住；不期此三人在將出科前突然倒嗆，以致　虧一簣未能成名，至今嗓音猶未復原，故皆在平居家不出。劉世勛等倒嗆後，繼起之人物爲沙世鑫，業世長，遲世恭，此三人雖當時似取劉俞王之位而代之，然實際受人歡迎者，祗一沙世鑫，世長世恭皆甚勉强。出科後世鑫首　大班，與毛世來合作南來，不料在滬竟一籌莫展，於是由時勢之造成，遲世恭葉世長反駕乎世鑫之上。以藝術論，目前當推世恭爲最佳，（現與宋德珠苟令香二人合作）世長力學馬連良，以做工身段見長，嗓音不甚響亮；但以世長爲富連成之小主，其將來之命運，或爲世恭所不及也。現在更新舞台出演之李世琦，原習武老生，後改硬裏子，爲一可造之才。此外尚有一李世章，亦爲裏子老生，世字輩中所產生之裏子老生，皆姓李，（世霖世琦世章）往往使人弄不淸楚，亦巧事也。至於世字輩中之武生，最缺乏人才，在科時也小過江世升高世壽二人而已。高世壽爲高慶奎之子，本亦可造之才，惜不岡上進，以致半途而廢，今淪爲二路武生，（世壽現隨　兄盛　曾數度隨盛麟南來）江世　藝頗不弱，以短打戲見長，今雖出科猶未搭班，以富連成世字輩之武生人才少，故世　乃爲人視爲鳳毛麟角矣。餘爲小生，江世玉爲最佳之一人，其藝雖難與葉盛蘭較，要亦一不可多得之才。尚有一張世孝，（前次曾隨徐　雯來滬但未能使人注意）原工旦，後改小生，江世玉滿師出科後，世孝代世玉而演小生諸戲，藝尚不惡，此外有一朱世芬，則平平而已。</p>
<h3>華聯同樂會之平劇</h3>
<p>— 籌成</p>
<p>華聯　樂會，以聯絡感情，研究　術，修養身心，改善生　，提倡正當娛樂爲宗旨，昨舉行　四屆徵求會員運動大會，到者數百人，由袁履登君報吿開會意旨後，該會平劇組會員表演平劇三齣，以助餘與。臺上高懸扮紅　緞黑字橫額二，一日「樂奏鈞天」，一日「樂正誼重」，旁有聯日，「往事描摹，欲借悲歡勵忠孝；」「高歌慷慨，敢云娛樂忘憂危！」係陳璉璋君所贈。第一齣鴻　禧，自跌雪求乞起，至洞房棒打止，程紫貞女士飾金玉奴，貌旣娟秀，嗓又甜潤，開門望父時，見人　臥雪中，憐具苦楚，令　入屋，給以殘羹，旋聞其自述，曾入　門，憐才之念，油然而生，　許以終身，含羞而不敢啟齒之態，將小兒女心　，描摹殆盡，堪稱面部有戲。厥後二次洞房，歷數乃夫以往劣跡，義正辭嚴，述至良心何在句，咬牙切齒，怨憤極矣。事下觀衆，爲其感動，均嫌僅責以棒，太覺便宜。實廣餘君之莫稽，唱做俱佳，相得益彰。第二齣討漁稅連殺家，應文源君之蕭恩，工架老到，李耀祖君之桂英，天眞爛　，沈覺民君之敎師，突梯滑稽，工力悉敵，並佳皆妙。第三齣貴妃醉酒，翟志馥君飾貴妃，堂皇富麗，幾個身段，表演得如風拂柳，滬飄若仙，令人目迷，調戲太監時，醉眼朦朧，亦演得恰到好處，票友中有此本領，殊不多覯。故彩聲如雷，停鑼已鐘鳴午夜矣。</p>
<h3>劇訊</h3>
<p>— 夏</p>
<p>麗都劇社，自成立以來，在社長高行君領導之下，積極籌備試演，該社演員，大都係國華及民華兩影片公司基本演員，陣綫相當堅强，聞下月中旬，將在本市某大劇塲公演云。</p>
<h3>新西千金</h3>
<p>— 星</p>
<p>國華的新作</p>
<p>吳村旣完成「黑天堂」後，有意繼續向時裝片發展，聞已決定下期新作爲「新四千金」，主角內定者已有周璇周曼華兩人。按　村曾於戰前編導「四千金」一片，由白楊龔秋霞舒繍雯黃耐霜主演，調子輕鬆明快，彷彿好萊塢作品。</p>
<h3>上海劇藝社　搜羅劇本　曹禺寄來一部</h3>

<h3>隨風而去（二）</h3>
<p>— 姚森元</p>
<p>＂Gone　with　the　Wind＂by　MargaretMitchell</p>
<p>一天史嘉蘭的父親回家說，阿許蘭同曼倫尼明天在阿脫浪泰別墅中要宜佈訂婚了，她聽之下，心中很難受，想不到這個消息眞的變成事實了，因此她想內中一定有個原因，一定是因爲她沒有表示過如是愛他的，况且她常把Touchme-not的態度對恃他，當然他會因失望而許同曼倫尼結婚了。所以她打算明天想個法子，使他們不能訂婚，因此一夜未睡。到了明天，她回她的父母和兩個妹妹，一同到阿脫浪泰去，在那裏她遇見曼倫尼的兄弟却爾斯蘇倫的情人法郞克與雷脫白脫勒等人，這許多人是她所不願意交　的，因爲她的心目中是急切地要找阿許萊。她找了好久，亦沒有找着他，後來遇見却爾斯，他吿訴她南北戰爭將要爆發，林肯已在招兵，他講得很高興，而他不知道這在史嘉蘭是不感到絲毫興趣的。忽然閒却爾斯向史嘉蘭求婚，這突然而來的請婚，使她一時亦不能回答什麼話。後來她遇見阿許萊，她表示她的愛他，願意與他結婚，那知這時的阿許萊已決定同曼倫尼結婚了，史嘉蘭失望之下，決定同却爾斯結婚，一則因爲他是曼倫尼的兄弟，她可以直接向曼倫尼有所報復，二則壘倫尼的親戚享尼亦愛着却爾斯，所以她同他結婚亦可以使享尼失望。</p>
<p>在二星期中史嘉蘭與却爾期結婚了，在兩個月後史嘉蘭已成了一個寡婦，因爲當他們結婚後，南北戰爭立即爆發，壯丁多被抽去作戰，却爾斯同阿許萊當然不能例外，但却爾斯則不幸戰死，阿許萊則仍在作戰，不久史嘉蘭產一子，名偉達。她在阿脫浪泰與曼倫尼同住漸漸變了很好的姊妹，因却爾斯的死曼倫尼對待史嘉蘭更親熱了。</p>
<p>一天，在募集醫院基金的一個跳舞會中，史嘉蘭遇見雷脫白脫勒，他們在阿許來與曼倫尼訂婚的時候已見過，而且雷脫當在第一次看見史嘉蘭就愛了她，可是他一向沒有表示，現在可巧在這裏遇見，他想一定能達到他的目的了，因此他即以史嘉蘭的名義捐款一百五十元以博她的歡心。現在雷脫已很當了他靠他的勇氣，在封鎖區域中進行他的商業投機，因此可提高物價而得厚利。自從他這次遇見史嘉蘭以後他常常來看她，並且送了很多禮物。有幾次他向她求婚，但都被史嘉蘭拒絕了，因爲她在世界上所眞愛的紙有阿許萊一人。</p>

<h3>German Troops Cross the Somme River, Fiercely Attacking French Positions but Repelled, Tank Units Penetrating the Champagne Region Destroyed, Germans Claim Breakthroughs at Several Points in the Weygand Line</h3>
<p>Paris - Military sources here say that the situation this morning was even more intense than before. The German army is attacking in three directions (one in the Amiens area, one in the Péronne area, and one along the Arleux Canal between the Aisne and Oise rivers). Their artillery is also heavily bombarding French positions in the Champagne region from the lower Somme River, seemingly to cover the army's advance. However, our positions are well-defended with anti-tank fortifications, which are proving effective, so the positions remain unshaken. On the evening of the 5th, many German tanks briefly broke through our lines, but because infantry units failed to follow up in time, they were ultimately destroyed by our forces. (Havas, June 6)</p>
<p>Paris - The enemy has concentrated a large number of tanks along the lower Somme River, attacking our positions. Our outposts there briefly repelled the enemy yesterday, but for strategic reasons, they were withdrawn voluntarily last night. (Havas, June 6)</p>
<p>Paris - Military sources here say that the Germans fiercely attacked the “Avenue de la Dame” region in the Arleux Canal basin yesterday. This morning, they brought in many cannons of various calibers and immediately opened fire with great intensity, seemingly to cover an infantry advance. In addition, they released a large number of smoke screens, causing the front lines to be obscured by thick smoke, making visibility poor. Their intent is both to cover the army's advance and to prevent French aircraft from reconnaissance. As for the air forces of both sides, they are extremely active. British and French aircraft engaged German planes in aerial combat yesterday and bombed German infantry and tank formations on the front lines. (Havas, June 6)</p>
<p>Paris - General Headquarters issued a communiqué tonight stating, "Since 4:00 AM today, the enemy has launched a new offensive in the areas of Amiens, Péronne, and the Arleux Canal basin, using tank units as spearheads to attack our positions. However, all attacks have been repelled. Our forces are holding their positions firmly and unmoved. In addition, our air force has been extremely active. A squadron of bombers flew to Munich and Ludwigshafen in Germany last night, bombing important factories, airfields, and railway stations. All targets were hit, and fires broke out in several places. Our aircraft also took the opportunity to conduct reconnaissance flights, obtaining important intelligence." (Havas, June 5)</p>
<p>Paris - Military sources here say that the Germans have been fiercely attacking our positions continuously since 4:00 AM this morning, ceasing only towards evening. The offensive was launched in three directions: one in the Amiens area, one in the Péronne area, and one along the Arleux Canal basin between the Aisne and Oise rivers. Elsewhere, fighting was less intense. In the Amiens and Péronne sector, the Germans hold two bridgeheads on the left bank of the Somme River, and using these as a base, they are fiercely attacking French positions under the cover of artillery, aircraft, and tanks. The attacks are becoming increasingly intense, but the French positions are protected by natural defenses and have overlapping lines of defense. Therefore, the German tanks are encountering strong resistance and are hindered by rivers and forests. Even if they break through the French positions, the infantry and supply units cannot follow up, and the tank units are unable to obtain supplies. As a result, they become isolated and vulnerable to French counterattacks. The situation today is exactly like that. Although German tank units have broken through French positions in some places, the French line as a whole remains intact. The general situation can be considered satisfactory. (Havas, June 5)</p>
<p>Paris - Last night, French officials stated that the French army is currently firmly resisting extremely intense enemy attacks, and it may be necessary to abandon some unimportant positions. The Germans, with particularly strong forces, are attacking the French left flank on the Somme River, having built three bridges across the Somme to reach the south bank. (Reuters, June 6)</p>
<p>Paris - At dawn this morning, as the battle of the Somme River resumed, French forces, for strategic reasons, withdrew slightly from the line from the coast to Amiens, but continued to hold other unbreached positions. The Germans, in an attempt to turn towards Le Havre and the lower Seine River, are applying extremely heavy pressure on the extreme right of the Weygand line. (United Press, June 6)</p>
<h3>German War Report</h3>
<p>Berlin - The German High Command announced last night that our army launched a battle inspection this morning, attacking French forces, crossing the Somme River, and breaking through the so-called "Weygand Line" at several points. (Haitong Press, June 6)</p>
<p>Berlin - Authoritative sources here say that German troops will enter Paris within a week. Two French counterattacks have been repelled by German forces. At 8:00 PM last night, German forces advanced on a "very broad front" between the English Channel and the Maginot Line, with two objectives: "First, to completely cut off communications between Britain and France. Second, to create a new base of operations for invading Britain." It is widely believed that the Germans will advance southwest along the coast from the Somme River to Le Havre, while another force near Soissons will advance directly towards Paris. This is a variation of the Schlieffen Plan. (United Press, June 6)</p>
<p>Berlin - German military experts, commenting to a reporter from the Haitong News Agency on the German High Command's war report, said, "One day after our troops occupied Dunkirk, the number of French soldiers captured was as high as 40,000, including three generals. However, no British soldiers were captured. Our army has established a defensive line there and begun to advance forward. In the four weeks after our army launched an offensive on the Western Front, it annihilated the British Expeditionary Force, driving the remnants off the continent. The French army has now fallen into a position of fighting alone. The previous day's war report stated that our Junkers bombers bombed troops concentrated south of Abbeville, which is another example of destroying enemy forces. The bombing of the port of Le Havre by German aircraft can be said to be a major blow to the French northern coast, as this port is extremely important to the French economy, and most of France's imported oil enters through this port." (Haitong Press, June 6)</p>
<p>Berlin - According to news received here, enemy tanks attacked near Abbeville yesterday. German anti-aircraft gun units and defending troops coordinated to repel the attack, with seven tanks destroyed by anti-aircraft shells. (Haitong Press, June 6)</p>
<p>Berlin - Judging from the situation here last night, the German plan is to defeat France first before launching a final major invasion of Britain. Nazi sources claim that if this offensive compels France to surrender, removing it from the war, then Germany can concentrate its forces to attack Britain, without having to worry about its rear. Otherwise, if Germany immediately attacks Britain, it will disperse its military strength and risk being attacked on two fronts. (United Press, June 6) ...waiting next to the direct-fire guns, waiting for the tanks to approach, and then opening fire fiercely at close range. The German troops were trapped in a web of fire, and French machine gunners forced German dispatch riders, motorized vehicle soldiers, and mechanized infantry to stop before their rain of bullets. Several tanks continued to move forward without assistance, and several even reached the French rear, where they were surrounded and destroyed by French forces. A spokesman firmly stated that this was only the beginning of the decisive battle that the German side hoped for, so more intense fighting would be seen on both flanks sooner or later. At dawn today, countless German tanks drove to the lower reaches of the Somme River, and major offensives would probably be launched there today. On the other flank, located to the right of Élet and the “Avenue de la Dame,” German artillery had been bombarding relentlessly, which was clearly a prelude to a new major offensive. When French aircraft raided last night, they shot down seven German aircraft in Normandy and approximately three more in the central region. According to responsible sources in London, the tactics of this German offensive are very similar to those used in Belgium and northern France previously. They are now trying to find a weak point in the French line, and once found, they will pour all their strength into the breach. The French side now admits that the Germans have made progress in several places, but it should be noted that the French defenses are very deep, and the German progress cannot be described as a breakthrough. However, there is still no definitive news about this major battle. The Germans are attacking in the Amiens area, especially near Péronne, and in the Soissons area, but the Germans have not yet reached Soissons. Armored vehicles have been reported to have appeared in the above areas. (Reuters, June 6)</p>
<p>French Army Establishes New Defense Line Along the Two Rivers Under Severe Circumstances</p>
<p>French Front - After the German army launched a powerful offensive yesterday with the intention of occupying Paris, the reporter went to inspect the Somme and Aisne fronts and found that the French army was doing its best to rally in a hurry to cope with this battle. The current French defense line is located in the area south of these two river basins, from the coast to the upper reaches of the Aisne River. The French army stationed on this defense line is the one that has been reorganized after withdrawing from Belgium.</p>
<p>French Army Adopts New Defense Strategy to Vigorously Block German Tank Offensives</p>
<p>Paris - Today, the authorities acknowledged that the German tank units advancing towards the French capital have broken through the Somme River line, but denied that the tank units have the effectiveness of an "axe." It is said that the German armored monsters have been surrounded by a new defense strategy and stopped on the Amiens to Laon line. It is also heard that the French army has abandoned the theory of fixed fortifications, such as building the Maginot Line, and is now concentrating its defensive forces to repel the German tank offensives. Well-informed sources said that the so-called new defense strategy is to deploy armored self-propelled direct-fire guns at many key points. According to military experts' estimates, the German offensive this time has mobilized 45 divisions, with 750,000 soldiers, 1,000 dive bombers, 2,250 tanks, and 15,000 motorized vehicles. According to eyewitnesses, dive bombers are equipped with sirens. When they descend rapidly from thousands of feet to drop bombs, the shrill whistling sound is accompanied by a rain of machine-gun bullets. They release powerful bombs when they are hundreds of feet above the ground and then ascend quickly. (International News Service, June 6)</p>
<p>London - A French military spokesman in Paris declared today that the battle has actually developed along the entire line from the coast to the Aisne River, ceasing only at nightfall. The support points held by the French army, after being hit by German tanks, remained unmoved. The enemy tanks were forced to stop, and many tank traps are waiting for them in front. The French army is holding villages and plains, obstacles planted in the fields, and low forests on both sides of ravines or woods. This defense line should be called the (1) Somme-Aisne Line. The army in the Aisne River section constitutes the right wing of the resistance army. Two weeks ago, there was no such thing as the Aisne Line. Therefore, the French army that had not entered Belgium originally garrisoned along the Belgian border. Because the Sedan-Charleville-Mezières line was captured by the combined forces of the German army and air force, it became necessary to build a new defense line at any cost. The solution to this problem was actually impossible for the French High Command, because the French army had to do its best to stop the German advance. The result of stopping the German advance, according to French Premier Reynaud, was that the 9th Army was completely disorganized. In his speech, Reynaud acknowledged that the disorganization of this army was an unfortunate fact. In order to contain the German army and rebuild the defense line, French tank units were immediately ordered to advance, regardless of any sacrifice, and to resist the German mechanized forces vigorously. With a small number of tanks (in some battles, the number of German tanks was ten times greater than that of French tanks), they engaged with the well-equipped German tanks. French mechanized units suffered considerable losses in some areas, but fortunately, the German [advance] was stopped at that time. While French tanks were fighting hard to resist the enemy, the French High Command ordered several French divisions to occupy the Aisne and Ardennes Canal Line. When the commanders of each division and regiment received the orders, they did not know how far the German [penetration] south of Sedan, Charleville, and Mezières was. French commanders occupied the line after receiving rapid orders, resisting the unknown enemy at great sacrifice. According to a certain officer who served in the American Expeditionary Force in the last European war, his troops arrived here four hours after receiving the deployment order. Although the French army has been subjected to fierce German attacks, its morale is still extremely high. The soldiers who spoke with the reporter all agreed that the German army would no longer be able to intimidate them with their tanks and aircraft. (United Press, June 6)</p>
<h3>Allied Forces in Norway Pursue German Troops</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden - Aftonbladet's report from the Lappland border states that the Allied forces have advanced about ten miles from Narvik along the railway transporting iron ore towards the Swedish border and reached Sildvik. The retreating German troops are holding the trenches there. The railway line is being bombarded by military installations and artillery units stationed in the highlands of Narvik, while the Allied forces are pressing towards Bjørnfjell. (Reuters)</p>
<p>Narvik - A Havas news agency reporter stationed on the northern front in Norway recently reported that after the Allied forces recaptured the port of Narvik the day before yesterday, French troops advanced eastwards along the railway in the Sildvik region, 17 kilometers east of the port, clearing out the remaining enemy forces. A total of more than one hundred German soldiers were captured today. (Havas, June 6)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The United States Bans Military Supplies to Japan</h3>
<p>The United States has a firm policy towards the Far East, and it is able to maintain a dignified style in implementing its policy; it has never been harsh or threatening, nor has it ever drawn its sword or brandished its spear, but it acts in various ways without yielding. This is truly a characteristic of American diplomacy. Recently, there have been new developments that are said to be not directed at Japan, but judging from past events, the nature of the sanctions is clearly visible; they are especially moderate and strong, probably waiting for the aggressor to realize his mistakes and repent in a not too embarrassing manner. In the past, on December 31, 1938, the United States sent a note to Japan, expressing its determination to maintain the Nine-Power Treaty and the Open Door Policy in China, without initially saying that it would follow up with action. On July 26, 1939, it announced the abrogation of the U.S.-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation, citing changes in the times and environment as the reason, without explicitly stating that this was the beginning of sanctions. On October 19, Ambassador Grew, stationed in Japan, conveyed the sentiment of American public opinion towards Japan in Tokyo in the form of a speech, which was earnest and clear, gentle without showing anger or resentment, and avoided attacking and denouncing. In January of this year, it indicated its refusal to continue negotiations on renewing the commercial treaty, and on the 26th, it declared the expiration of the treaty as scheduled. In March and April, it mobilized a large naval and air force and conducted an unprecedented exercise in the central Pacific, and after the event, it explicitly ordered them to remain stationed in Hawaii; it said that it was for self-defense and vigilance, not for demonstration. Furthermore, it has repeatedly loaned large sums of money to China for more than two years. Although the Japanese also frankly admitted the seriousness of the meaning of all these measures, the United States handled them lightly, as if nothing had happened. Until yesterday, there were two more things: first, a complete ban on the export of national defense military supplies; second, the planning and establishment of a military base in Alaska. Alaska is a peninsula in northwestern North America, close to the Soviet Union and confronting Japan, and is the closest American territory to mainland Japan. According to the U.S. Army authorities' explanation: The Soviet Union has fortifications in the Far East, less than 100 miles from U.S. territory; the Soviet Union intends to prevent Japan's invasion of Siberia, but who knows if there will ever be a day when it will use it to deal with the United States, so the United States should have something to counter it. The statement is very clever, and those who are knowledgeable must be able to see whether the United States' sudden rush to catch up is really for defending against Russia in the future or for dealing with Japan today? Regarding the ban on the export of national defense military supplies, according to the U.S. State Department's explanation: This measure is not included in the scope of the moral embargo against Japan, and it is only because of the needs of the U.S. national defense that exports are prohibited. It is widely rumored that although the U.S. embargo measures are said to treat all countries equally, separate measures will be made for Britain, France, and China. Regardless of the truth of the rumors, no matter how much the degree of accommodation, it is obvious that the most affected in practice is Japan. Yesterday, the North China Daily News telegraphed from Tokyo: "The news that the United States is about to ban the export of various major items to other countries has greatly shocked Japan again. It is felt here that Japan is the one most seriously affected by this step; although the United States has stated that it is prohibiting exports for its own needs, Japan still suspects that the United States will give preferential treatment to countries it sympathizes with, while Japan will be adversely affected by these new regulations. Sources well-informed in the Japanese army say that if the Western countries are determined to cut off Japan's main necessities, then Japan will naturally be forced to advance south." In that case, we say that the United States has a firm policy towards the Far East, and it implements it in a dignified manner in various ways, and we confidently believe that we are not being untruthful.</p>
<p>Telegraphic news is vague and lacks details. What the United States has now prohibited from exporting is rumored to be machinery, military supplies, or certain major items. The details and scope of the ban are currently unknown. However, judging from the severity of the Japanese reaction today, and considering the great extent to which Japan has historically relied on American material resources, it is not difficult to imagine the impact of the American ban on Japan's aggression and what kind of meaning it will have. From a general trade perspective, from 1934 to 1938, a total of five years, Japan's total exports to the United States amounted to 2.6 billion yen, and imports from the United States amounted to about 4.5 billion yen, with Japan's import surplus reaching a huge 1.9 billion yen. On the one hand, Japan can be regarded as a major customer of the United States, but on the other hand, it can be seen that Japan's need for American goods is great, and the amount of material support that the United States provides to Japan is huge. Judging from the trade commodities between the United States and Japan: apart from raw silk, which is a major item in Japanese exports to the United States, there are also canned foods, pottery, porcelain, fabrics, toys, tea, and chrysanthemums. All of these are not indispensable to the lives of the American people, nor are they necessarily sourced from Japan; however, the vast majority of what Japan trades with the United States consists of military supplies. Taking the statistics for 1937 as an example, the import of American cotton into Japan was a strong 61 million U.S. dollars, which was the largest item; in addition, scrap iron was worth more than 37 million U.S. dollars, copper was slightly less than 18 million U.S. dollars, pig iron was slightly less than 10 million U.S. dollars, steel ingots were more than 8.7 million U.S. dollars, gasoline was more than 7 million U.S. dollars, and steel plates were more than 5.7 million U.S. dollars. Sheet steel was more than 4.4 million U.S. dollars, all of which are raw materials for the artillery fire used to bomb China. Comparing this amount with the total amount of military supplies imported by Japan from various countries, it accounts for 75% to 85% of the total. The proportion of American support to Japan can be seen. Only because of this proportion, it is understandable that Japan is "greatly shocked" upon hearing the American ban, it is reasonable, and the situation is inevitable. They then sullenly said, I will have no choice but to advance south. Japan intends to advance south, as this newspaper discussed yesterday, and it does not stem from the American ban; and the United States naturally adheres to its firm policy and will not abandon its ban because of Japan's threat of advancing south; what we want to wait and see is how other parties in the Pacific will follow the United States and collectively prohibit the export of military supplies, shortening the scourge of aggression, since the aggression and atrocities in the Far East have not only been suffered by China, but the resistance war has allowed other parties in the Pacific to gain temporary peace.</p>
<h3>Mediterranean Situation Increasingly Urgent: Italy Declares "Danger" Zone, Plants Mines in Territorial Waters of Mainland and Colonies, Prepares to Implement Blackouts to Prevent Air Raids</h3>
<p>Rome – The Italian government announced last night that mines have been laid in the territorial waters of Italy, Albania, and its colonies, creating a "danger" zone within twelve nautical miles of the aforementioned areas. This declaration coincides with the escalating crisis in the Mediterranean. Italy has begun preparing its people for war. Italian newspapers continue to attack the Allied powers for persecuting Italians. Premier Mussolini, yesterday, during the celebration of the 126th anniversary of the Italian cavalry, received General Moro, commander of the cavalry, and senior generals, giving them orders concerning the possibility of Italy joining the European war. To implement blackouts, Italian authorities have ordered all residents, shop owners, and hotel owners to prepare everything to prevent light from escaping during air raids. All vehicles must install low-intensity headlights. Violators will be subject to three months imprisonment and a two thousand lira (Italian currency) fine. Meanwhile, the official Italian Stefani News Agency published news from Beijing, stating that it received a report from the Italian consulate in Charleroi that, before the German occupation of Belgium, French officers had executed seven Italians in Vieu and Cabanal for espionage. "Is this the only crime of France in persecuting Italians in Belgium?" (United Press, 6th)</p>
<p>Rome – The government has just issued a communiqué stating, "The sea within twelve miles of the coast of mainland Italy and its overseas territories will henceforth be a dangerous navigation area. All ships wishing to enter ports within this area must obtain permission and instructions from Italian consular or military authorities. Those already en route to these ports must promptly notify the port authorities of their location, the date, and time of entering the dangerous area so that pilots can be dispatched. Failure to comply with these measures will result in assuming all risks." In addition, the government issued a communiqué stating that, effective immediately, the sound of a siren will be used as an air raid warning. Factories are generally prohibited from using them at other times. (Havas, 6th)</p>
<p>Rome – It is reported that Mussolini will deliver a speech to the nation from the balcony of the Palazzo Venezia tonight. All evening newspapers featured news of the new German offensive on the front page with large headlines. The Rome Mail stated that the French army could not win, while the Fascist newspaper ridiculed the Maginot Line. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<p>Rome – There are no political indications today regarding Italy's possible entry into the war. Rumors that Mussolini would deliver an important speech tonight could not be confirmed. According to political figures, Italian authorities may need to delay the final decision for several days. However, this afternoon, several squadrons of aircraft, each with eight or ten planes, flew low over the city, likely to stimulate the people and prepare them psychologically. By evening, blackout regulations were more strictly enforced, with most streets only lit by dim green lights. (Havas, 6th)</p>
<p>Paris – Observers here are still unclear about the date and manner of Italy's entry into the war. It is generally believed that Italy will join the war when the current German offensive reaches its peak. This is after France notified Italy that it was prepared to negotiate, but Italy has not yet responded. Therefore, if Italy does enter the war, it will have no valid excuse, regardless of what pretext it uses. Italian newspapers are currently making efforts to spread propaganda, pointing to difficulties between Turkey and Greece, but both Turkey and Greece have denied this. In addition, German propaganda has claimed that Swiss aircraft pursued German aircraft in French airspace, which is similar to the situation before Germany invaded Belgium and the Netherlands. (Havas, 5th)</p>
<p>Rome – Yesterday, well-informed Italian sources claimed that reports that former French Premier Laval is currently residing here were rumors. (Reuter, 6th)</p>
<h3>U.S. President and Italian Premier Continue to Exchange Views, Advising Against Entanglement in European War: Rumors of Italy Willing to Mediate European Situation with Conditions</h3>
<p>Washington – The White House announced last night that President Roosevelt is continuing to exchange documents with Premier Mussolini, with the initial aim of avoiding the expansion of the European war. The White House and the State Department yesterday again refused to disclose any content of this exchange. No indication was given as to the extent to which the United States is considering Italy's demands on the Allies to help maintain peace in Southern Europe. The Italian government's lack of action regarding entering the war on Tuesday led some here to believe that there is a possibility of Italy not directly entering the war. Well-informed sources stated that Italy did not enter the war on Tuesday, which means that, at a minimum, Washington and Rome still have time to exchange views. It is understood that this exchange of documents has also extended to other capitals. There have been various reports published here about the documents between President Roosevelt and Premier Mussolini, but none have been officially confirmed. Well-informed circles stated that outside reports about the U.S.-Italy talks are clearly the result of unofficial observations by second-rate news outlets. The information in these reports did not come from the White House. (United Press, 6th)</p>
<p>Washington – Well-informed sources here generally believe that President Roosevelt is continuing to exchange views with the Italian government authorities, seeking to maintain the country's non-belligerent status. However, it is reported that Mussolini has expressed a willingness to mediate the current European war, but only on the condition that France cede certain territories in its mainland and African colonies to Italy. According to diplomatic figures, President Roosevelt has likely advised Mussolini that if Italy participates in the war, 250 million people living in countries along the Mediterranean coast will be drawn into the vortex, and American public opinion will react strongly. In the eyes of the American people, Mussolini's position will automatically become the same as Hitler's. In addition, although the President did not explicitly tell him that the United States would intervene after Italy entered the war, he stated that American anxiety is growing and public opinion is becoming increasingly hostile toward dictatorial countries, making it highly likely. Moreover, since Britain and France have recently reaffirmed their determination to fight to the end, President Roosevelt can rely on this determination to inform Mussolini that the war will definitely be protracted. Regarding this matter, sources close to the White House recently mentioned that the remarks made by Democratic Senator Pepper are worthy of attention. Pepper said, "I firmly believe that President Roosevelt will definitely express something clearly to Premier Mussolini, with no possibility of misunderstanding. I believe that if Premier Mussolini involves Italy in the war's vortex, he will suffer a whiplash from the United States, like a slave crawling into a dungeon, with eternal regret for the rest of his life." White House officials stated that President Roosevelt did not use such strong language when communicating with Premier Mussolini, but they said that Pepper's remarks were made after a visit to the President. In short, the President's efforts have delayed the date of Italy's entry into the war. If Italy does enter the war after all, the President can make Italy bear the responsibility for expanding the war, making this public to national and world opinion. (Havas, 6th)</p>
<h3>British and French Air Forces Penetrate Deep into German Territory, Bombing Military Targets</h3>
<p>Paris – An Air Ministry communiqué stated that yesterday our air force was extremely active. French bomber squadrons flew to Mannheim, Ulm, Ludwigshafen, and Munich, bombing various military targets. A factory in Badische Anilin und Soda Fabrik was bombed, and a fire broke out, which was visible far from the French border. In the evening, French bombers again heavily bombed important targets in Saint-Quentin, Péronne, and Cambrai. Stations and roads were bombed, and transportation was completely disrupted. German troops resting in these areas were also bombed. French aircraft dropped six tons of bombs. Since the German offensive, intense air battles have broken out. French fighters have been very effective in assisting the army. French infantry and tanks advance together with air support. In addition to intercepting enemy transportation lines, French aircraft have also inflicted heavy damage on enemy motorized units. A large number of enemy aircraft were shot down by our forces. Detailed information cannot be released at this time. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<p>London – The Air Ministry announced that British medium bombers heavily bombed enemy transportation lines to the Somme battlefield yesterday. British fighters operating from France maintained offensive patrols throughout the day, destroying six enemy aircraft. One British aircraft was lost. British bombers attacked enemy troop concentrations last night and disrupted enemy activities in the rear. Another group of British bombers bombed railway junctions and troop assembly areas west of the Ruhr and military targets inside Germany. Two British aircraft are missing. British aircraft also attacked oil depots in Belgium. This morning, when British aircraft bombed Ghent, they not only hit the oil depots with heavy bombs, but also descended from high altitudes using the light from the burning gasoline to spread the fire further with incendiary bombs.

<h3>French Cabinet Reshuffle: Foreign Minister and Minister of National Defense Positions Concurrently Held by Premier Reynaud</h3>

<h3>Major Battle Imminent on West Bank of Han River: Japanese Troops Crossing River Attempt to Attack Yichang, China Has Thorough Preparations in Place</h3>
<p>Chongqing – A Chinese military spokesman announced that a major battle is expected to occur on the west bank of the Han River soon. It is estimated that one-third of the Japanese troops attacking Yichang have crossed the Han River. 15,000 Japanese troops have crossed the river east of Shashi, and a total of 30,000 troops are currently crossing the river. Chinese commanders have made thorough preparations to deal with the Japanese attack on Yichang. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<p>Chongqing – According to Chinese sources, the Japanese troops in Hankou clearly intend to seize Yichang. Japanese troops who arrived in Xiangyang on the west bank of the Han River on June 1 are reportedly moving southwest towards Nanzhang, forming the northern force attacking Yichang. Further south, Japanese troops gathered on the east bank of the Han River between Zhongxiang and Qianjiang are reportedly crossing the river in several places near Shayang, northeast of Shashi, yesterday under the cover of artillery fire and aircraft, in order to advance towards Yichang along the Hanyi Highway and the north bank of the Yangtze River. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<p>Chongqing – By dusk on June 4, the major battle on the border of Henan and Hubei provinces had concluded with a glorious Chinese victory. To cover up their disastrous defeat, the Japanese are again crossing the river at various points upstream and downstream of the Xiang River. Currently, the Japanese crossing plan has encountered unexpected setbacks at various crossing points and is in a difficult situation. The evolution of the situation has gradually progressed to the eve of a major battle on the west bank of the Xiang River. Recently, a certain authoritative military observer discussed the future of the war, stating that the Japanese defeat on the east bank of the Xiang River is a foregone conclusion, and the fate of launching a major battle on the west bank of the Xiang River will inevitably be the same, because China has made full preparations in advance and can use agile and proactive strategies to control the situation. Regarding the general results of the major battle on the border of Henan and Hubei provinces and the recent situation of the battle on the west bank of the Xiang River, a certain military spokesperson told the Central News Agency reporter as follows: By June 1, most of the remaining Japanese troops were concentrated in Zhaoyang, and the Chinese troops from various directions also calmly and actively pressured and besieged Zhaoyang. By noon on the 2nd, the Chinese forces entered the city, and fierce street battles broke out immediately. The Japanese troops fled in several directions. The Chinese forces completely recovered Zhaoyang and fiercely intercepted and blocked the Japanese troops in the Wujiaji area of the Xianghua Road. On the 3rd, the Chinese forces launched a fierce battle against the retreating Japanese troops near Tangxian Town and Zhangjiaji, completely defeating the Japanese troops in one fell swoop. The remaining Japanese troops fled towards the Dahong Mountains. The Chinese elite forces in the Dahong Mountains carried out a large-scale mop-up operation against the Japanese troops. As a result, most of the Japanese troops were annihilated, and a small number fled towards Zhongxian, Jingshan, and Anlu. The major battle on the border of Henan and Hubei provinces has completely ended. The current situation is that, except for the key points on the highway north of Suixian, which have been recovered by the Chinese forces, other areas have completely returned to the state before April 30. The Japanese troops have suffered this disastrous defeat, and it is judged that they will soon launch another large-scale operation in an attempt to cover up their defeat. As expected, from the late night of May 31, the Japanese troops crossed the river at Wangjiaji and Oujiamiao between Xiangyang and Yicheng, with a number of about 12,000 people. After crossing the river, they attacked in three directions: one towards Yicheng, one towards Nanzhang, and the main force of the third towards Xiangyang in the north. On June 1, the Japanese troops once charged into Xiangyang. The Chinese troops fought bravely and counterattacked. By the morning of the 3rd, they defeated the Japanese troops and recovered Xiangyang. The Japanese troops attacking Yicheng had very weak combat power and made no progress. The Japanese troops near Nanzhang were defeated by the Chinese forces in one fell swoop and retreated towards Wu'an Weir. The Chinese forces fiercely pursued them, and the Japanese troops continued to flee southeast. In addition, there were Japanese troops crossing the river in the lower reaches of the Xiang River. From 11:00 PM on June 4, the Japanese troops on the front of the Hanyi Highway began to forcibly cross the Han River in several directions, one north of Luohan Temple (north of Shayang), one at Sigang, and one near Qianjiang. By dawn today, more than 10,000 Japanese troops had reached the west bank of the Xiang River. The Chinese troops along the river used intense firepower to inflict heavy damage on the Japanese troops while they were crossing the river. The Japanese troops suffered serious difficulties. As of now, there are still small groups continuing to cross the river. In summary, the number of Japanese troops who have crossed the river north of Yicheng and in this area is about 20,000. It is expected that a second major battle will unfold in a few days. The Chinese army has an early and clear judgement and full preparation. The result of this battle, the Japanese side will inevitably suffer another defeat, can be asserted. (6th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing – A Chinese military spokesman stated that one of the most important battles of the Sino-Japanese War will occur this week between Yichang and the west bank of the Han River in central Hubei. About 30,000 Japanese troops have crossed the Han River and are approaching Xiangyang. Another 15,000 Japanese troops have approached Shayang and Qianjiang in the lower reaches of the Han River. The Chinese army recaptured Xiangyang on June 3. Although the Japanese army is launching a fierce counterattack, the Chinese army is still firmly defending the city. The Japanese side has now dispatched more than 30,000 troops to fight in the area between Yichang and Xiangyang, and there are about 20,000 reserve troops in the Hanyi Highway area, preparing to supplement the attack on the west bank of the Han River. This move by the Japanese is clearly to obtain Yichang, but the defense of the city is very strong. It will be difficult for the Japanese to penetrate deeply. The Chinese army has been building fortresses in the area for two years. The city is now like an impenetrable wall of iron. It is feared that the main battle next week will not be in Xiangyang but near Yichang. (United Press, 6th)</p>

They are still fighting fiercely on the west bank of the Xiang River, which is crisscrossed by rivers and dotted with lakes. (6th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>US Government Uses Huge Sums to Build Strong Navy - Daily Expenditure of 2 Million Gold Dollars - Another Battleship to be Launched This Summer</h3>
<p>Washington. The U.S. government is spending approximately 26 million U.S. dollars daily to build the world's strongest navy. By 1941, the government's daily construction expenditure will reach 2 million U.S. dollars. According to the Navy Department's estimates, the average daily expenditure for machinery and construction is 20 million U.S. dollars, while armaments, armor, and munitions cost 6.5 million U.S. dollars monthly. This monthly expenditure will soon increase to 24.5 million U.S. dollars and 7.083 million U.S. dollars. This expenditure will increase further when the additional shipbuilding facilities approved by Congress are completed. By the end of 1939, the United States had eighty warships under construction in government and private shipyards, including eight battleships, two aircraft carriers, thirty-three destroyers, sixteen submarines, and numerous other small vessels. These expenses only cover the cost of new ship construction and do not include the expenses for naval bases and personnel. According to Navy Secretary Edison's recent announcement to Congress, government shipyards employ 67,000 civilians. Among the battleships under construction, the 35,000-ton "North Carolina," costing 65 million U.S. dollars per ship, will be launched this summer. Another 35,000-ton "Washington" was launched last week. Construction of battleships began in 1937. According to Edison, these battleships will equal or exceed the power of other warships of "the same type." Edison claimed that if these warships were planned today, their designs would undergo significant changes. Although shipbuilding expenses have increased sharply in recent years, future shipbuilding expenditures will not be relaxed. Naval officials feel that the United States can no longer rely on the assistance of other countries and must possess a fleet capable of resisting any enemy or coalition of enemies. Since the end of the Soviet-Finnish War and the weakened position of the Allied powers, "the naval community feels that the nation's self-reliance in defense is more necessary than before. They feel that Britain's great fleet, once regarded as America's guard dog and a supplement to American strength in the Atlantic, must now remain very close to Britain."

<h3>United States Expands Monroe Doctrine - Foreign Affairs Committees of Both Houses Pass Important Declaration</h3>

<h3>Churchill Reports on the War Situation (Conclusion) - National Defense Forces Strong and Robust</h3>
<p>However, while we are gratified by the safe escape of the great army, and those who love them should feel comforted after this painful period, we cannot ignore the recent events in France and Belgium. The consequences of these events, in addition to the aforementioned, have also caused us to lose a large part of the fortified lines on which our confidence rested, and many valuable mining areas and factories have fallen into enemy hands. We often hear that Hitler has a plan to invade the British Isles. This plan has been considered frequently in the past. The current military strength of this island is stronger than at any time during this or the last war. Therefore, the issue of domestic defense against invasion has, of course, undergone a significant change. However, we must not be complacent because we are capable of defense. We still have obligations to the Allied powers. Therefore, we must reorganize the Central Expeditionary Force, and it will still be led by General Gort. All of this must be done in succession. However, in the meantime, we must place the defense of the British Isles in an extremely secure position, so that it can be defended with the fewest possible troops, and we can achieve the greatest possible potential offensive effort. We are currently working on this.</p>
<p>If the House wishes to discuss this issue (cheers), it is appropriate to hold a secret session to discuss it. This is not because the government must reveal the secrets of the army and navy, but because it wishes to allow our discussions to be free, without having to worry about the enemy reading them the next day, thus preventing us from expressing ourselves fully. The government can benefit from the opinions expressed by the various parties in the House.</p>
<h3>Strict Prevention of Espionage Activities</h3>
<p>We now feel that we should implement an increasingly strict plan, not only to deal with enemy aliens and other foreigners whose actions are suspicious, but also to deal with British citizens who could be disruptive if the war extends to Britain. (Cheers) I know that many people will be affected by the government's orders. These people are ardent enemies of Nazi Germany, but I cannot express enough apologies to them, because in the current situation, we do not have time to make the detailed distinctions we would like to make. If the Germans attempt to land paratroopers in Britain, causing fierce fighting, then it is better for these unfortunate people, for their own sake and for the sake of others, to leave the war zone. There is another type of person for whom I have no sympathy. Parliament has given us powerful means to stop the activities of the "Fifth Column." We will use this power without hesitation. Everything will be supervised and corrected by the House until we are satisfied that we have eradicated the harmful elements mixed in among the masses, and even more than satisfied.</p>
<h3>Lesson from Napoleon's Failure</h3>
<p>Returning to the issue of the invasion of Britain, I dare say that in all the long centuries, there has never been a time when we could boast of being able to resist invasion, nor has there ever been an absolute guarantee against serious air raids to the people as there is today. In the Napoleonic era, a great wind arose, seemingly about to blow his troop transports across the Channel. Today, the same wind, or even worse, is in the path of fleets tasked with maintaining a blockade. Opportunities arise frequently. This is an opportunity to create illusions that mislead many tyrants on the Continent.</p>
<p>Lately, hearsay has frequently reached our ears, asserting that the enemy will definitely use novel methods to attack. Having seen the source of the evil and the ingenuity of aggression displayed by the enemy, we must, of course, prepare to respond to various novel tactics and all kinds of barbaric and treacherous movements. I do not think it should be dismissed as fantasy, believing it should not be given consideration. We must not fix our eyes on it and pay close attention. However, we should never forget the firm protection of the sea, and the protection of air power, if used properly, is also very reliable.</p>
<h3>Hope Everyone Will Fulfill Their Duty</h3>
<p>I firmly believe that if the people can fulfill their responsibilities, not relax in the slightest, and make the best arrangements they are currently making, then we can once again prove that we have the power to defend our island nation and escape the storms of war. Our existence can be forever free from the threat of tyranny, and if necessary, we will do so for years. If necessary, we will accomplish this alone. (Cheers) This is what we are striving to do today. This is the determination of the British government, and everyone in the government feels the same. This is the will of Parliament and the nation. After the Prime Minister finished speaking, Smith rose to speak on behalf of the Labour Party. He was very pleased to hear that the Prime Minister had informed the nation in the simplest of terms what efforts they would be asked to make. Following this, Labour MP Ellen Wilkinson asked the Prime Minister to guarantee an early opportunity to hold a secret debate. The Prime Minister replied, "I understand that next Tuesday may be convenient." (Reuters dispatch, 5th)</p>

<h3>A "Neutral" Voice at the Beginning of the European War (1)</h3>
<p>— Uncle Di</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>In early September of last year, Britain, France, and Poland officially went to war with Germany.</p>
<p>At the time, I was in London. Because I was thinking about the terrible destructiveness of modern warfare, I was worried all day long. On the other hand, because I had such a good opportunity to witness this major event in human history, I was excited all day long. The subject I was studying happened to be "International Relations." Even though I was suffering from quite severe asthma, I was still going everywhere from morning till night. I went to the university for research, to the British Museum for reference materials, to professors, classmates, and friends, to Parliament to listen to speeches and debates, to various research conferences, and I paid attention to the discussions of all kinds of people in the streets and alleys... I was reading, observing, listening, discussing, and thinking... In the evening—sometimes late at night—I returned wearily to my residence, brewed a pot of strong coffee, and facing a lonely electric light that seemed to be shining extraordinarily brightly, I took notes of what I had gained that day, piece by piece. Occasionally, I would stroke my slightly numb and swollen legs, but now, looking back, it seems that I didn't feel much emotion at the time, at most just a deep breath; then I would bury my head again and continue with my notes. However, now, when I turn over my notes from that time, what comes to mind are two other things I encountered several times.</p>
<p>One thing:</p>
<p>When I was concentrating on taking notes, I was startled many times by a gentle knock on the door.</p>
<p>"Who's there?"</p>
<p>"Excuse me, Mr. X, your 'Blinder'..." This was the voice of the landlady, or sometimes her daughter's voice.</p>
<p>"Ah! I'm very sorry!" I had forgotten to close the "Blinder," which had just been installed to prevent wartime air raids. I hurriedly ran over to close it, apologizing at the same time.</p>
<p>"Excuse my interruption. Good night!"</p>
<p>"Excuse my negligence. Good night!" Hearing the sound of footsteps going down the stairs, I realized that the landlady got up several times a night to inspect whether the lights in each room were properly covered. At times like these, I often felt a sense of unease, which made me stop writing and stare blankly for several minutes.</p>
<p>Another thing:</p>
<p>At the entrance of the graduate school, the museum, etc., because I was lost in thought, I didn't notice and was about to step inside when I suddenly felt a gentle tap on my shoulder.</p>
<p>"..." I turned my head in surprise.</p>
<p>"Excuse me, sir, I believe you are carrying your gas mask?" A policeman who was at least twice my height, bent over, looked down, and had the kind of smile on his face that we see in pictures of the old god of longevity.</p>
<p>"Of course!" I hurriedly opened my briefcase.</p>
<p>Glancing at the gas mask stuffed in the corner of the box, he immediately closed the box for me, nodded, and sometimes raised his hand in a salute. "Excuse our stopping you. Thank you!"</p>
<p>"Excuse me for not having it on my shoulder. Thank you!"</p>
<p>At times like these, I also felt a sense of solemnity engulf my heart, and it lingered for a long time, making it difficult for me to read for quite a while.</p>
<p>I don't know why, but I always felt as if there was some connection between these trivial matters and all of Britain's internal and external positions and measures. Therefore, when I open my notes from that time, I can't help but think of these two trivial matters.</p>
<p>I have been back in China for three months in the blink of an eye. Now, flipping through my notes from that time, some have lost their timeliness, and some need to be reorganized or supplemented. And of course, there are many places that need to be greatly revised. The evolution of the European situation in the past month or two seems a bit dazzling on the surface, but in fact, even if we study and infer from the various situations at that time, they are all inevitable developments. A part of my notes at that time was related to the issue of neutrality of various European countries at that time. Now I give it a title and publish it for everyone's reference, because I have preserved the true picture of the impressions at that time, and nothing has been changed. The dates attached to each article at that time have not been erased.</p>
<p>(I) "Neutrality"</p>
<p>When we recall the second act after the so-called official declaration of the European war, which was the successive declarations of war by various third countries against Germany, and then look at the successive declarations of "neutrality" by various third countries after Britain and France declared war on Germany, the differences between them are very obvious and can be understood at once.</p>
<p>Of course, hidden beneath the noisy voices of "neutrality" are the recent tense diplomatic activities in various areas; what is making the fundamental decisions, however, is the shift in the overall international situation.</p>
<p>In Europe, the basic attitude of Britain and France is this: their consistent fundamental policy is to compromise with Germany and Italy, using Eastern, Southern, and Northern Europe as a bargaining chip to obtain their guarantee not to threaten their overseas colonies. In this line, they also pull in the Western European countries of the Netherlands and Belgium, which also have vast overseas colonies, and add Switzerland. However, if Germany and Italy show signs of infringing on the territory and independence of these Eastern, Southern, or Northern European countries, what attitude should Britain and France take? This can be divided into two situations: first, if Britain and France do not agree in advance, they will of course express their opposition; second, if they obtain tacit consent from Britain and France in advance and offer considerable exchange conditions, then they can also support it. An example of the former is the invasion of Albania this spring; the most obvious example of the latter is Czechoslovakia. However, if Germany and Italy directly threaten Britain and France themselves, what do Britain and France hope from these small countries? There is no question that they hope that they will declare war on Germany and Italy! In this sense, you can understand that in this war, the so-called "Allies," the relationship between the three countries is like this: rather than saying that Britain and France were tough on Germany because of the threat to Poland, and thus the war broke out, it would be better to say that Poland, because the disputes between Britain and France and Germany and Italy could not be resolved, and at the same time, believed that Germany would not use force against itself no matter what, therefore, in order to use this situation to obtain the satisfaction of expanding outwards, it was tough on Germany on the Danzig issue to the end, and thus the war broke out. Therefore, when studying this issue, we must always keep in mind the situation at the time of the outbreak of the war, which was: (1) from beginning to end, the door to German-Polish compromise was not closed until Britain and France declared war; (2) the biggest and most sensational demand of Germany and Italy on Britain and France, although it has been rumored for a long time, has not had the opportunity to be put forward because they are busy cleaning up the small European countries; probably once the European matter is completed, and the navy has been expanded in three or two years, the demand that will be immediately put forward to Britain and France is: to divide the world's colonies equally!</p>
<p>Let's look at the German side. Its consistent contempt for other ethnic groups and countries, and its consistent belief that the submission of various small European countries to Germany is a natural conclusion, on this point, there is no difference between today's German rulers, the Nazis, and its ruler, Emperor Wilhelm, twenty-five years ago. However, the difference is that in terms of the weapons to achieve his ambitions, Hitler has two more weapons than Wilhelm II: one is economic control, and the other is propaganda. This time, when the eyes of the whole world were attracted by the fire and blood of Hitler's war of aggression against Poland, everyone silently overlooked that Germany was simultaneously carrying out economic control over some other countries: it monopolized the entire export of kerosene and oil from Romania, monopolized the sales of all agricultural products from Hungary and Spain, and monopolized most of the exports of livestock and poultry from Yugoslavia. What was even more overlooked than this, however, was the constant onslaught of German propaganda. To this day, the situation in various small European countries is: on the one hand, they are trembling with fear of Germany's military power; on the other hand, the forces of those pro-German and pro-Italian internal fascist parties are raising their heads day by day. What does this mean? This means that under it, the German propaganda weapon has been effective; on its upper level, the pro-British and pro-French arguments in the small countries are being shaken. Then, what does Germany hope for in their specific attitude towards this war? As long as Germany has not made a great determination to fight Britain and France, it hopes that they will maintain so-called "neutrality," which means to keep the door wide open for its own import of raw materials and export of manufactured goods, making the naval blockade of Britain and France ineffective; at the same time, it also hopes that they will resist the blockade of Britain and France, and use the name of "violating neutrality" to provoke the relationship between them and Britain and France. If one day Germany makes a great determination to fight Britain and France, then, in addition to Italy and Spain inevitably joining the war, Germany will of course still hope that the remaining countries will "maintain neutrality" and act as transshipment agencies for goods for Germany and Italy, but at that time, for the sake of military necessity, perhaps one or more of the three countries, the Netherlands, Belgium, or Switzerland, will eventually be dragged in. As for the present, the important people of Germany, openly and secretly, on the eve of the invasion of Poland and in the days after the outbreak of the war, have repeatedly expressed to them: "We hope you will be neutral"; and said, "As long as Britain and France respect your neutrality, Germany will absolutely respect it."</p>
<p>Comparing the attitudes of Britain and France on one side and Germany on the other, we can roughly come to a conclusion: the "neutrality" of various countries is unfavorable to Britain and France; to Germany, it is a fixed plan and an ideal result. – I must add one more sentence: here, the word "neutrality" that I use is absolutely abstract and is not affected by other conditions. For example, if any small country joins the war, even if the side it joins is on the German side and is against Britain and France, what will be the result? It is still beneficial to Britain and France, and unfavorable to Germany; conversely, it is beneficial to Germany and unfavorable to Britain and France. If we use an example, we can just cite a country at random: if Bulgaria (or Yugoslavia) joins the war to help Germany, what will the situation be? In that situation, first of all, there will not be a big change in the comparison of military strength on both sides; but secondly, first, Britain and France can immediately block all its imports and exports in the Black Sea (or the Adriatic Sea), and second, British and French troops can immediately land in its territory and go through Romania to assist Poland, uniting the eastern and western battlefields.</p>
<p>Therefore, the work done by Germany's diplomacy and propaganda in recent times is the so-called localization of a conflict. The work of Britain and France, however, is: "In the name of humanity," they are also "hoping that the area of conflict will be limited;" however, in the name of strategy – although they have not said it – they are in fact looking towards the direction of the expansion of the battlefield, and proceeding slowly.</p>
<p>However, the fact revealed is the voice of universal "strict neutrality" – (September 16, London)</p>

<h3>Teachers' Day and Confucius' Birthday Are Held at the Same Time</h3>
<p>The Shanghai education community initiated the celebration of Teachers' Day on June 6th and held it for several sessions. Subsequently, after the authorities approved it, Teachers' Day should be held jointly with Confucius' birthday on August 27th. Therefore, since last year, Teachers' Day has been changed to be held on Confucius' birthday. However, some school teachers in this city still take today as Teachers' Day and take a holiday, which is actually due to a mistake in memory, according to the Dahua News Agency.</p>

<h3>International Cup Miniature Football Final: The Chinese Team's Lineup is Revealed, to Compete for the Championship with the British Team Tomorrow Afternoon</h3>
<p>The International Cup miniature football tournament, in which eight heroes competed, has been eliminated after fierce competition. The final will be held tomorrow (Saturday) at 5:30 pm. The champions will be decided between China and Britain. Both sides are strong and evenly matched. It is hard to say who will win. The Chinese team broke through the Jewish and French teams in the past to reach the final week. The British team suffered the poison of failure in the first battle, but fortunately entered the quarter-finals with a one-goal advantage. Their victory over Portugal was a masterpiece of surprise attack. Their strength cannot be underestimated. The Chinese team has specially selected the strongest and most balanced lineup. The selection of personnel is not exactly the same as in the previous two games against the Jews and the French. Strong players such as Cai Shengson, Gao Baozheng, etc. have come to the team. Zhang Mingsheng's foot injury has recovered and he has also decided to play, forming a resolute and persistent firepower with Sun Jinshun and Zhang Mingsheng. The lineup is announced as follows:</p>
<p>Chinese Lineup</p>
<p>Shi Xin (Lido) Sun Jinshun (Lido)</p>
<p>Qin Biga (Golin) Sheng Sensen (Golin) Huang Kehou (Lido) Zhang Songgen (Lido) Zhang Mingsheng (Lido)</p>

<h3>Zhen Ri Cup Small Football Tournament Coming to a Close: Two Years of Achievements</h3>
<p>The Second Zhen Dan Cup Small Football League and International Cup, sponsored by the Aurora University Sports Committee, has been underway since the middle of last month. The champions of each division in League A and B, as well as the finalists in the international competition, have already been determined. After the championship battles to be held tomorrow and the day after, and the charity competition at the end of next week, this grand event will come to a successful conclusion. The organizers specially hosted a banquet last night at the aforementioned location on Rue Luber to entertain Chinese and foreign newspaper reporters. The Zhen Dan Cup, over the past two years, has earned immense praise from society. The motivation behind its initiation is worth recounting, as follows:</p>
<p>The Zhen Dan Cup small football tournament was conceived around the spring and summer of [year]. At that time, countless refugees in Shanghai were facing hardships. Aurora University, in the spirit of Catholicism, provided a football field as a site and opened a refugee shelter. To raise funds, they initiated the small football tournament. Its founding purpose was to merge charitable work with the promotion of sports. The income accumulated has reached a considerable amount and has been entirely allocated to relief efforts, benefiting the refugees, which is no small feat. Last year, it was originally intended to continue the event, but it was abandoned due to the closure of the refugee shelter and the holding of the French-Chinese Er Cup competition by the Sino-French Institute of Technology. This spring, Ma Xiangbo, a senior member of the National Government, passed away in Liangshan, Vietnam. In commemoration of Ma's achievements, Aurora University decided to construct a Ma Xiangbo Memorial Hall in the northwest corner of the new campus. The scale is extremely grand, with facilities such as a gymnasium and swimming pool. The plans have been completed and construction is scheduled to begin soon. To raise funds for the project, the second Zhen Dan Cup small football tournament was initiated. All ticket revenue will be allocated to the construction of the Ma Xiangbo Memorial Hall. As for the ticket revenue from the two championship finals tomorrow and the day after, it will be donated to the French Red Cross. The ticket revenue from next week's match between the Chinese United and the Western United teams will be allocated to the Sacred Heart Hospital in Shanghai. Over the past two years, the Zhen Dan Cup small football tournament has not only promoted sports but has also used every bit of the audience's contributions to benefit humanity. This is truly admirable.</p>

<h3>Fluctuations in Foreign Currencies</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market was volatile and slightly firm. British and American gold pounds also rebounded by one yuan. The supply and demand of British gold notes was balanced, and the market price stabilized. American gold notes initially opened slightly higher at 18.8 yuan due to the continuous decline of the British pound in the New York market.

<h3>Gold Market Wants to Fall But Stops, Once Entering the 6,000 Yuan Mark</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cash gold black market, wanted to fall but couldn't, and the market was uncertain, especially in the afternoon session where the trend was undecided with high and low points alternating. The opening was only 6,030 yuan, due to the continued strengthening of the opening exchange rate. Then, retail investors and money changers continuously released and sold, and suddenly fell into the 6,000 yuan mark, miserably reaching 5,940 yuan. Suddenly, a certain securities firm's bulls aggressively bought on the cheap, and silver firms also pulled. At the same time, the exchange rate also slightly turned softer. With the support of buyers, it returned to the 6,000 yuan mark and reached a high price of 6,150 yuan. However, the aforementioned securities firm had an unstable intention and soon sold out, and money changers and others also came to sell, and it fell back to 6,010 yuan. The afternoon closing was 6,095 yuan. The market outlook was stable in the quiet. The initial opening was 6,200 yuan, and buying and selling were in stalemate. Because silver firms and money changers were willing to release short positions, it once fell by more than 20 yuan. However, a certain silver firm's buying intention was very strong, and it rose again to 6,120 yuan before closing. The result was a final 6,100 yuan, which was 20 yuan better than the previous day. The total transaction was about three thousand and several hundred taels. Jewelry gold in silver shops was listed 10 yuan higher, while customs gold and other items remained level.</p>
<p>Gold Increased by 20 Yuan</p>
<p>Since the morning, each bar (ten taels), initially due to the weakening of the exchange rate and the weakness of people's hearts, the public sold at the opening, so gold shops gave silver firms ten taels for 6,030 yuan, which was a small 50 yuan less than the previous closing. Then, because the selling trend was still strong, and there were very few buyers, it immediately broke into the 6,000 yuan mark. A certain household gave a gold shop twenty taels, which became 5,940 yuan. Later, because a certain securities firm saw it cheap and was absorbing, and at that time the exchange rate market had turned tight, silver firms also followed by pulling vigorously, and short sellers saw [the situation] and rushed to cover their positions, jumping by 210 yuan. A silver firm gave a fellow firm a total of fifty taels, for 6,150 yuan. [Because] a certain [securities] firm's bulls made a profit and came out, and a certain silver firm and money changers also vigorously released each other, the market situation recovered and weakened. Securities firms and gold shops each gave money changers ten taels, all for 6,050 yuan. After 11:00 AM, gold shop [firms] suddenly came to compete and absorb, and a certain money changer also tended to absorb, and it rebounded again by 70 yuan. A silver firm gave a securities firm [a number of] taels, for 6,120 yuan. At noon, there were gradually fewer buyers, and gold shops and silver firms released and then stepped down by 25 yuan. A gold shop gave money changers 50 taels, for 6,095 yuan as the noon closing price. The afternoon opening was slightly higher by five yuan. A silver firm bought ten taels from a money changer, for 6,100 yuan. An off-hand gold shop did ten taels, for 6,105 yuan. Later, money changers and silver firms sold, and it stepped down by 25 yuan. A gold shop gave a silver firm ten taels, for 6,080 yuan. Then, because another silver firm frequently absorbed, and securities firms also had buying, it soon rose by 40 yuan. A securities firm bought [] taels from a silver firm, for 6,120 yuan. After entering, a certain silver firm released back, and retail investors also sold, so it fell back by 20 yuan. Silver firms made ten taels with each other, for 6,100 yuan, as the evening closing price. As a result, it increased by 20 yuan compared to the previous day. The high and low trading for the whole day was around 210 yuan. The selling price of spot gold by cash shops was tens of yuan higher than [the price of] gold, and the purchase price was reduced by 30 yuan. The current margin gold was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and both were rarely traded. The exchange of gold jewelry in silver shops was initially</p>
<p>Jewelry Listed 10 Yuan Higher</p>
<p>The exchange of jewelry gold in silver shops, initially Da Tong Hang still suspended 620 yuan, and at 9:45 it listed 10 yuan higher, and at 10:30 it fell back 10 yuan, and at 11:20 it listed 10 yuan higher again. There were no changes after this. It is estimated that Da Tong Hang changed to suspend 630 yuan, and the new peers had the same price, and the purchase price was reduced by about 30 yuan.</p>
<h3>Coal: Hongji Slag Discounted</h3>
<p>Since the price of Hongji white coal lumps increased yesterday, only the price of Hongji No. 2 white coal slag, because it is the raw material for manufacturing coal balls, has been repeatedly requested by various small coal ball factories. From today, Yitai Xing, Dalong Xing, and fellow firms will dismantle and appropriately reduce the price. It is estimated that the port handling is 120 yuan per ton, and the delivery charge is added, which is 14 yuan lower than the previous market price.</p>
<h3>Medicinal Materials: Yizhiren Opens as Soon as it Arrives, Up 50-60 Yuan from Before</h3>
<p>Yizhiren has been out of stock for a long time, and the market feels quite scarce. It is heard that several pieces have recently arrived from Qiongzhou and are immediately opened for sale. The transaction price is 220 yuan, which is 50-60 yuan higher than the previous market price. If there are no more arrivals later, it may rise again.</p>
<h3>Grains: Foreign Rice Continues to Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Due to the fatigue of the previous day, the rice market was still soft yesterday morning, retail sales were sluggish, and speculators were also selling off. The prices of various foreign rice fell by 30-50 cents. Xiaowen opened at around 50 yuan, and Tokyo [type] rice was 49.5 yuan. [The market] turned because the original brokers have been holding [prices] steady. However, Hangzhou, Shaoxing, and Ningbo gangs suddenly took advantage of the cheap prices, and rural customers and local shops are preparing for the upcoming Dragon Boat Festival. In order to prepare for the market closure, they are preparing in advance. Temporarily, demand increased. Under various requests, a good opportunity for sellers was created, and shouts rose one after another. As a result, the market turned from fatigue to tightness.</p>
<p>Foreign rice once softened yesterday morning, but was quickly replenished by Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and other inland gangs. The 2,000 tons of Siam rice contacted by Jianyuan were not settled due to quota issues, and the market was raised by more than one yuan in the customer hoarding revival. Then, Heyi Foreign Company sold 750 tons of June lower rice at 59.8 yuan, which was a small corner less than the previous price. There were also other contacts, and the market began to return to level. The ups and downs were mixed in the afternoon, and the evening closing was still 50-80 cents higher than the previous evening. However, nearly 100,000 bags of Siam rice have been recently traded, and contact has not stopped. If the exchange rate shrinks slightly, it will inevitably come from the source, and the market may not see another surge.</p>
<p>Also, a large amount of foreign rice has arrived in Shanghai. Yesterday, Taikoo Company's Yingzhou ship arrived, carrying 9,900 bags from Hong Kong. At the same time, Qiongzhou ship arrived in Shanghai, also loaded with 8,907 bags from Hong Kong. A total of 18,807 bags arrived yesterday. The two ships were docked at piers 1 and 2 of the company in the French Concession. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, the workers unloading cargo from the ship went on strike, so it could not be unloaded yesterday.</p>
<p>Although five or six cars of japonica rice and glutinous rice continued to arrive yesterday, the selling price in the production area of japonica rice has risen and it is difficult to meet the Shanghai market, so although there are few rumors of off-market transactions, the selling intentions are very strong and all keep to the original market. The glutinous rice market was also soft in the early morning, and then it turned tight with the rise of foreign rice. As a result, the prices before and after can be called a settlement. It is estimated that Jinli special rice is 46.8-46.5 yuan, Changdan white rice is 45.6 yuan, and Jiangbei white rice is 43.4 yuan.</p>
<h3>Flour Sales Decline Due to Difficult Shipping</h3>
<p>The flour market still tended to be strong yesterday, but sales have decreased compared to the previous two days. Because shipping is very difficult, new transactions have gradually become sluggish. It is estimated that about 6,000 bags were traded in small batches in the street. In order to maintain their nature, each factory still used the original price of 13.8 yuan. Except for supplying daily needs, they are unwilling to supply a large amount. Inland flour is also in a state of dwindling, and supply and demand are both quiet. It is heard that the production price in the mainland must be above 14 yuan, so there is no hope of a source for a while. Therefore, the market is calm, and the market will expand, waiting for the autumn when the new wheat is on the market. Also, 50,000 yuan of flour was shipped to Quanzhou yesterday, and 1,362 bags were shipped to Yantai today.</p>
<h3>Securities: Domestic Bonds See Mixed Gains and Losses, Foreign Stocks Continue to Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday's securities black market entered a state of rotating ups and downs. Category C hovered around the 50 yuan mark. Buyers wanted to buy low and sellers wanted to sell high, and neither would give way, so the market price was increasingly stagnant. The Category E bonds will be drawn tomorrow, and then it will be the turn of the 10th draw for Category A bonds in August, so the Category A market is uniquely strong, rising by as much as 1.7-1.8 yuan in recent days. As interest rates approach, there are also fewer sellers in each bond. In yesterday's trading, Xie Da Yichang absorbed quite a bit in the morning, while Hongkang and Nos. 16 and 38 offered a bit. The market was balanced. In the afternoon, Yitai, Tongshun, Yichang, Datong, and others bought in, while Runli, Lianhe, and retail investors sold out. The market price rebounded slightly, but the result was still mixed gains and losses, with only one or two corners. The transaction volume was about 700,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock Trading: 30 shares of Bank of Communications stock were traded at a price of 67.75 yuan.</p>
<p>The stock market has renewed hesitation. The expectation of news about the war is even greater than the stimulation of commercial interests. The total daily trading volume was only 144,000 shares, and prices uniformly went downstream. British Listening stock fell by 1.75 yuan compared to the previous closing, [Company] [Small] by 2 yuan, Reclamation by 80 cents, Yihe by 2.25 yuan, and the previous closing prices for International, Shanghai, and Yangzi were 13.3 yuan, 14.3 yuan, and Zan 9.3 yuan respectively, while yesterday's closing prices were only 11.1 yuan, 13.1 yuan, and 8.65 yuan.</p>
<p>Among real estate stocks, Zhongying stock had no changes, while Zhonghe stock retreated by several corners to 14.6 yuan, Yeguang also fell slightly to 10 yuan, and Huamao stock was sold at 2.5 yuan.</p>
<p>There were more inquiries about rubber stocks, but buyers could only be attracted after prices were reduced.</p>
<p>London, 5th (Wednesday) - The listed market prices of Chinese foreign debt remained stable today, and there were no changes in bonds across the board.</p>
<p>London, 5th (Wednesday) - The listed market prices of various British companies' stocks fell slightly today. Shanghai Waterworks A shares fell by 1 pound to 14 pounds, and Security Insurance shares fell by 3 pounds to 25 pounds. The rest remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Delivery of Futures Yarn Becomes Problematic, Decline in Local Yarn Remains Fierce</h3>
<p>The yarn market continued to be weak, and the decline remained fierce. This is because the exchange rate is stable, there is no hope of improvement in overseas cotton markets, and the delivery of certain yarns is still facing problems. The selling price of existing yarn is declining step by step. Therefore, Chinese yarn is indirectly threatened. As a result, bulls are discouraged and sell out, and the market is unstable.</p>
<p>Sentiment in the existing yarn market remained weak in the morning, and there were few buyers in the market. The price of 20s Double Horse yarn was 1,300 yuan. It was later heard that the opening exchange rate had not changed much, and selling sentiment suddenly increased, and the market price fell step by step to 1,260 yuan. The market suddenly rumored that the Soviet Union had joined the Allied Forces, and buying increased slightly, returning to 1,280 yuan. The closing was slightly weak. As a result, the price of 20s Double Horse yarn fell by 36 yuan. The statistics of transactions in half a day totaled 1,445 bags. Today, 120 pieces of yarn will be shipped to Yantai and 1,710 pieces will be shipped to Tianjin. Also, yesterday, 432 pieces were shipped to Quanzhou. The amounts purchased by each gang are listed as follows:</p>
<p>Peers: 1,030, Hong Kong: 415</p>
<p>Total: 1,445</p>
<h3>Unstable Yarn Prices, More Tired Cotton Market</h3>
<p>Cotton transactions were exceptionally quiet. This is due to the ups and downs of the local Indian and American cotton markets, coupled with unstable yarn prices, so morale is scattered, and factories are at a loss. The market is even more tired. The details of current cotton transactions are listed below:</p>
<p>Dazhong Collection 242.00 - Peers bought 100 bags</p>
<p>Kangjiang Flower 202.00 - Peers bought 100 pieces</p>
<p>Mittelring 292.00 - Peers bought 100 pieces</p>
<p>Also 298.00 - Xinyu bought 100 pieces</p>
<p>Also, concerning the market price of foreign cotton, the New York cotton market has not improved in recent days. First, the market lacks major buyers, and then due to the decline in stock prices on Wall Street and the sale of a portion of spot goods, the closing prices were flat for the near term and fell by seven or eight pounds for the long term. The Indian market has stabilized. Yesterday's [price] predicted an increase of one rupee.</p>
<p>The foreign cotton transactions in Shanghai have not loosened recently. Although the Tianjin gang occasionally has some transactions, the number is not large, so it has not affected the market. The prices of term cotton sent to factories, converted at the US dollar exchange rate of 5.3125 yesterday, are as follows:</p>
<p>20s - American Mittelring - 316.95</p>
<p>Also - Also - Lower Grade - 307.00</p>
<p>32s - Also - 325.00</p>
<p>Also - Also - Lower Grade - 324.10</p>
<p>42s - Also - 338.90</p>
<p>Also - Also - Lower Grade - 329.80</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Poplin, Foreign Yarn, and Bleached Cloth See Extreme Transactions</h3>
<p>In the domestic cloth market, current sales in various directions have gradually developed recently. However, due to the large number of hoarded goods, sentiment was weak under the influence of the yarn price decline yesterday. Small floating hoards of selling orders are the loosest, so although the overall market is stable, a portion of scattered coarse and fine cloth and bleached and dyed cloth fell by 25-50 cents per piece. Customers are also taking a wait-and-see attitude, and transactions have sharply decreased. Approximately 100 pieces of woven cloth and greige were traded on the street. Wholesale and retail business for local and out-of-town [customers] traded more than 3,000 pieces, mainly poplin, foreign yarn, and bleached cloth. Guangdong sales of printed cloth and twill are relatively strong at approximately 100 pieces, and the Sichuan and Yunnan gangs sold forty to fifty boxes of blue cloth.</p>
<p>The Eastern cloth market remains sluggish, and selling orders continue to decline. Longtou fine cloth opened at only 39.5 yuan in the morning, and later rebounded to 40.025 yuan. Sizijun serge once fell to 1.025 yuan, and the closing price was 1.035 yuan. Mid-range miscellaneous fine cloth fell by another yuan per piece compared to the previous day, and the situation is particularly [].</p>
<h3>French-Western Lining Increases</h3>
<p>The overall market for woolen fabrics remained strong yesterday, and all goods tended to be excellent. Both retail and wholesale transactions were strong. The French-Western lining market is currently seeing a squeeze. Both imported and domestic goods are mostly out of stock. Western goods, Love 277, have not been imported, and market inventory is limited. In addition to Hongsheng 288 and Yinfeng 1470, there is no production of domestic factory goods. The current supply does not meet the demand, and the standard will be immediately increased. Yesterday, the current wholesale price of Love 277 French-Western lining was traded in the marketplace, 2 [units] net, 288 sold for 1.4 yuan, and 1470 sold for 1.05 yuan.</p>
<h3>Palles Stripes are the Most Popular</h3>
<p>Palles is at the peak of its sales season. Sales of clothing for both Chinese and Western styles are widespread. The sales are mainly for striped and other patterned goods, which are the most popular, and the market has seen an increase as a result. Plain colors seem to be more tired. Although their outlets are also prosperous, their supply is abundant, so they cannot rise. Currently, plain Palles are only sold in store clothing stores, while striped and patterned Palles are needed for both Chinese and Western styles. The shipment and local production of plain colors are more than stripes, and the market conditions have created popular stripes and plain colors. Recently, the average high and low difference in the current wholesale price of striped and plain Palles is one or two yuan per yard.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea Overseas: Silk Prices Decline; Filature Cocoons Exceed 500 Yuan</h3>
<p>Overseas silk prices have declined uniformly in Japan and the United States, stimulated by poor actual sales of raw silk in New York last month. Japanese silk has fallen by 4.75 points on the 83rd grade, Chinese silk has fallen by 3 points, New York's near and far futures have each fallen by 2.5 points, Yokohama spot prices have fallen by 40 yuan, and far futures have fallen by 23 yuan. The Shanghai silk market is quiet. The silk itself is already expensive, and foreign firms are further reducing prices. The price difference between domestic and foreign silk is significant, so no transactions are taking place.</p>
<p>In the Wuxi cocoon market, because small silk factories and the brokers are raising prices, improved fresh cocoons have exceeded 500 yuan per picul. Consequently, "Central China" is finding it difficult to purchase raw materials, so it issued an "order" to stop weighing cocoons the day before yesterday, in order to lower the price of low-grade cocoons.</p>
<p>Twenty bales of rayon, shipped from Hong Kong by the Taikoo Company's Yingzhou轮 [steamer], arrived the day before yesterday. Today, more than 450 bales of rayon originally in this city are being loaded onto the Taikoo Company's Hunan轮 [steamer] to be transported to Tianjin. Due to a strike by dockworkers on the ship, it is feared that they will not be able to be shipped out today. (Zu)</p>
<h3>Green Tea: European Sales Remain Sluggish</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the green tea market situation for foreign firms was as follows: European firms are very pessimistic about importing due to the worsening international situation. The market for Chun Mei green tea has seen almost no transactions in the past week because overseas dispatches do not urgently need it. Yesterday, only Xiehe, Jianfudede, and other firms purchased ordinary Zhen Mei and Fine Needle teas, totaling just over 160 boxes. Zhen Mei sold for 365 yuan, and Fine Needle tea sold from 95 to 105 yuan, unchanged from before.</p>
<p>In addition, 770 pieces of tea arrived from Hong Kong yesterday, another 36 pieces from Ningbo, and 2,322 pieces from Wuzhou. Today, 80 pieces will be transported to Yantai, and another 605 pieces will be transported to Tianjin.</p>

In addition, 2,937 bags of sugar arrived from Hong Kong yesterday.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Daylily Now Sold for Cash</h3>
<p>Daylily was previously traded with drafts, but recently, because the discount rate fluctuates unpredictably, sellers in various regions feel quite inconvenienced. Yesterday, the Zhenjiang gang sold a batch of daylily, with the deal being 37.5 jiao in cash.</p>

<p>United Press, Tokyo, June 6: Japanese newspapers today report that the Japanese government "attaches importance" to news carried by Japanese sources in Shanghai regarding France's plan to transfer the rights of the French Concession in Shanghai to the United States. Japanese newspapers hinted that, given Japan's role as a "stabilizing force in East Asia," the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs plans to lodge a protest with both France and the United States. It is reported that the Asia Bureau has taken note of news coming from Shanghai, but Japanese newspapers did not carry denials from U.S. and French officials in Shanghai. According to an official statement issued by the Asia Bureau, France must contact the "Wang regime" and transfer the French Concession to the "Nanjing government." Japanese Navy Spokesperson Rear Admiral Kanatake stated today at a press conference, "If France truly intends to transfer the French Concession in Shanghai to the United States, the Japanese government cannot ignore this."</p>
<p>Rumors Resurface: German Envoy to Return Home</p>
<p>Since the war situation has turned unfavorable for the Japanese, with repeated defeats, they have shifted their focus to deploying a so-called "rumor offensive." The story of the ambassadors of Britain, France, and the United States conducting peace talks was spread previously, followed by news of "peace" being transmitted from Rome, but rumors are groundless and self-defeating, and often clarified by facts in short order. Recently, after fabricating rumors such as "U.S. troops withdrawing" and "police power of the French Concession being transferred to the United States" in Japanese newspapers in Shanghai, the Japanese *Continental New Report* even published a message the previous day (May 5th) stating that German Ambassador to China, Dr. Trautmann, would return to Germany in the near future, and claiming that "this trip is related to the Sino-Japanese peace negotiations." A reporter from the *Great China News Agency* specifically inquired about this matter at the</p>
<p>German Embassy</p>
<p>The person in charge of the Shanghai office confirmed that this news was also completely unfounded. According to the person in charge of the office, "German Ambassador to China, Dr. Trautmann, has absolutely no plans to leave Shanghai and return to Germany. Japanese newspapers may have mistakenly transmitted the recent return to Germany of Mr. Bidde of the German Embassy in China." This proves the exhaustion of their rumor-mongering skills.</p>
<p>Dutch Ship Not Escorted by U.S. Warship</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Japanese Domei News Agency also claimed that a Dutch ship had arrived in Shanghai escorted by a U.S. warship on Tuesday of this week. This was denied by an officer of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet here, who pointed out that no U.S. Navy ships had arrived in Shanghai on Tuesday. Observers say that the Japanese are repeatedly fabricating facts and spreading all kinds of unfounded rumors, which is obviously a planned and purposeful effort.</p>
<p>Sincere Company Denies Transfer</p>
<p>The Japanese side yesterday also reported that the local Sincere Company would be purchased by the Japanese side for 30 million yuan, and said that the two sides are currently negotiating. However, yesterday the authorities of the Sincere Company officially denied the rumors. According to the company authorities, speaking to the *Great China News Agency*, this news is completely unfounded. The Sincere Company has never offered the company for sale, and the Japanese and other parties have never requested to purchase the company.</p>
<p>Also, this news was seen in the Japanese *Daily News* on April 2nd, and the company published a statement in the Chinese newspapers of this city on April 4th, claiming that the matter was absolutely incorrect. Unexpectedly, after a month, they fabricated the same news again. The company's total capital is 3 million yuan, and current business is even better than before. The Japanese</p>
<p>fabrication of rumors</p>
<p>The motives are difficult to fathom, and the company authorities also said they could not explain it. However, the company's business department said that this move by the Japanese side is because Japanese merchants are eager to seek a base in Shanghai for dumping their goods. It is also learned that after the Japanese first announced the news of purchasing the Sincere Company two months ago, the Japanese newspapers repeatedly</p>
<p>revealed</p>
<p>and hyped up this news. Yesterday, the Japanese side also claimed, "The negotiations for the Japanese purchase of the Sincere Company have made significant progress. According to reliable sources, the Japanese side has now offered 25 million yen to purchase all the buildings and equipment, while the company insists on 30 million Japanese yen."</p>
<h3>Grand Opening of Great Wall Insurance Company</h3>
<p>Great Wall Insurance Company was established by leaders of the financial and industrial circles in this city, with the approval of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Insurance experts have been hired to manage the company. The grand opening was yesterday, and people from all walks of life came to offer congratulations in an endless stream. In one day, the company accepted a large amount of insurance from major domestic goods manufacturers and banks. The company's business policy is to fully underwrite the assets of local Chinese people, and, given the large number of overseas Chinese in Nanyang islands and the Dutch East Indies, the company will also establish branches there.</p>
<h3>U.S. Implements Embargo; Japanese Authorities Feel Unease; U.S. Aims to Eliminate War; Japan Threatens with Southern Advance Plan</h3>
<p>According to foreign sources, the U.S. government notified the Japanese authorities on the 3rd of this month that it had issued an order prohibiting the shipment of all raw materials needed to realize the country's military expansion plan to foreign countries. Tokyo was extremely shocked upon receiving the news, as the scope of this embargo is wider than before. Japan will bear the brunt of it, and the impact will be significant. Many believe that the U.S. authorities took this action because they were extremely dissatisfied with the recent</p>
<p>air raids on Chongqing by Japanese aircraft, which echoed the activities of Nazi Germany in Belgium and northern France. The United States decided to take this action to warn Japan. Also, a private message from Washington stated that the U.S. authorities will no longer send any warnings or diplomatic documents to Japan, but have decided to bring Japan to heel, and its purpose is not to start a war but to eliminate war. U.S. public opinion unanimously believes that the time has come to impose economic sanctions on Japan. If Japan continues to act recklessly, it will undoubtedly suffer the most unfavorable consequences. However, a senior Japanese military officer in Tokyo told foreign reporters that if Western countries refuse to supply raw materials to Japan, Japan will inevitably implement its southern advance plan. Japan, unrepentant, continues to threaten the great powers, with malicious intent that is truly unpredictable.</p>
<h3>The Latent Financial Trend Is Not Optimistic</h3>
<p>Year-End Loans: Special Prudence</p>
<p>The Dragon Boat Festival settlement for Shanghai's industry and commerce is approaching. Each industry has separately sent personnel to collect outstanding debts. The banking industry is busy collecting and settling accounts. The Shanghai branch of the Four Banks Joint Office is working hard to regulate the finances of its peers, ensuring the continued stability of the financial system. Banks have decided to take a day off for the Dragon Boat Festival (June 10th) as usual. They are also aware that while Shanghai's financial situation appears very stable on the surface, the latent trend is not optimistic. The ratio of current to fixed-term deposits is high, with current deposits accounting for as much as 20%, and the trend is increasing. Nowadays, those with funds in Shanghai are competing to speculate and manipulate the market. The use of funds lies in being able to cope with any situation at any time, so that windfall profits can be sought. Meager fixed-term deposit interest rates are not considered, so everyone is flocking to current accounts, waiting for an opportunity to move and use funds. Therefore, banks must be prudent with all loans to prevent speculation and manipulation.</p>
<h3>Stamp Tax in Shanghai Concession Areas Transferred to Direct Tax Office</h3>
<p>In order to collect inheritance tax and other direct taxes, the Ministry of Finance has specially established a Direct Tax Office, with Gao Bingfang as the director. The responsibilities of the office are: (1) Collecting national income tax, inheritance tax, and other direct taxes, and also handling stamp tax collection; (2) Studying and improving the systems and tax rates of the various taxes under its jurisdiction, and reviewing tax rates; (3) Handling cases of tax reduction, tax exemption, and tax refunds for the various taxes under its jurisdiction; (4) Calculating, auditing, registering, and reporting tax revenues for the various taxes under its jurisdiction; (5) Drafting, reviewing, interpreting tax laws and regulations for the various taxes under its jurisdiction, and handling disputes with the Ministry; (6) Appointing, dismissing, transferring, and evaluating tax personnel for the various taxes under its jurisdiction; (7) Other matters related to the tax affairs of the various taxes under its jurisdiction. It is heard that the stamp tax in the Shanghai concession areas, which was previously handled by the Tax Affairs Bureau, has now been transferred to the Direct Tax Office. Before the establishment of the Direct Tax Office, it will be temporarily handled by the Shanghai branch of the Income Tax Office.</p>
<h3>Municipal Government Documents in the Custody of the Public Works Department</h3>
<p>The puppet "Mayor" Fu Xiaoan recently "requested" the Public Works Department to return the documents of the former Shanghai Municipal Government Land Bureau that were deposited with the Public Works Department. The Public Works Department resolutely refused, as it was its duty to do so. In the previous year, the puppet "government" had once attempted to seize these documents by illegal means. The Bureau specially mobilized a large number of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps to guard day and night to prevent accidents. Later, in order to make it permanent, the Bureau built extremely thick walls around the room where the documents were stored, and all doors and windows were dismantled and replaced with walls. It is not only extremely sturdy, but also has no gaps. Armed volunteer corps are still stationed around to guard the area.</p>
<h3>The Puppet "Shanghai Market" Commodity Tax Collection Issues</h3>
<p>In addition to the "Central Market" at the Xizang Road bridge and the "Food Market" on Wusong Road, which are Japanese puppet organizations controlling vegetable and local product prices in this city, a "Shanghai Market" has recently emerged. Competition among them has become increasingly fierce, and vegetable and local product merchants are in dire straits, caught in the net. The control methods of the "Shanghai Market" are the same as those of the "Food Market" on Wusong Road. A "donation tax" of 3% is levied on the price of goods, and then merchants are allowed to "operate freely." However, according to a letter from lawyer Hu Fenglian, there is no matter of donating 3% at "Shanghai Market".</p>
<h3>Summary of Important News</h3>
<p>Postal Notice: (1) Due to the special local situation, all parcels and bulk small package mail items to the Tanghu Town, Xishan Beizhen, and Baibao Town agency offices under the Yixian Bureau in the Beiping District should be temporarily suspended for acceptance. (2) Insured parcels to the Xiuwu Bureau (temporarily transferred from the Henan District to the jurisdiction of the Beiping District) can now be accepted again.</p>
<p>The puppet "Shanghai Municipal Government Finance Bureau" has "established a so-called Collection Office for Paper Money and Paper Products," occupying the site of the China Morality Oil Factory on Wusong Road in Hongkou as its location. It was declared "established" on the 1st of this month, and all tin foil paper will be subject to a heavy tax.</p>
<p>The Nanshi "Local Court" is planning to take over the Pudong and Huxi "Sub-Courts." Because the Japanese special affairs agency firmly opposed cooperation in Pudong, the attempt to take over on the previous day did not succeed.</p>

<h3>Shaoxing Rice Allows Free Exchange; Rice Bound for Ningbo Arrives Today; Ningbo Fellow Association Holds General Meeting Today</h3>
<p>A rice shortage has occurred in seven counties of Shaoxing, and the situation is severe. The Shanghai Shaoxing Fellow Association is actively raising funds to purchase rice and transport it to their hometowns for relief, in order to serve their homeland. They also telegraphed the Ministry of Finance, earnestly requesting free exchange of foreign currency. Yesterday, the Shaoxing Fellow Association revealed that it had received a reply telegram from Shanghai gentry Wang Xiaolai regarding the matter of telegraphed request for free exchange of foreign currency for disaster relief, as follows: "Telegram received. Deeply concerned about the rice shortage in our hometown. I visited Kong, and it has been approved as requested, totaling two million yuan in total. Wang Detian (5th)"</p>
<p>Second Batch of Foreign Rice</p>
<p>The association began relief work last winter after Xiaoshan fell. When Shangyu was ravaged by Japanese aircraft on March 28th and 29th, they organized the Shangyu Emergency Relief Association and the Shangyu People's Food Regulation Association to plan relief methods. They also commissioned Association member Lu Zhinan to take 154,000 yuan to return to his hometown for emergency relief. Furthermore, they ordered 4,000 bags of貢 [tribute] rice from Hong Kong. In addition to the 2,000 bags already shipped, the remaining 2,000 bags, added to the rice shipment on the Glen Line [steamer], are being shipped from Hong Kong to Ningbo and then to Shaoxing, and are expected to arrive today. The association has commissioned four people to go to Shaoxing to handle price stabilization, with a stabilized price of 40 yuan per stone. The total loss is about 100,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Shangyu People's Food Association Appeals for Donations</p>
<p>The Shangyu People's Food Regulation Association wrote to Shangyu compatriots, calling for donations for disaster relief. The original letter said, "We are writing to you to report that, according to Commissioner Zhao's report in Shanghai, the rice shortage in the interior has reached its extreme. Eating bran and gnawing grass is common. In addition, the weather is arid, rivers are drying up, and 30-40% of the rice paddies have not been planted. If it does not rain in another five days, the seedlings that have already been planted will also crack and die. The arrival of rice from Shanghai this time was a great joy for the town. At the same time, a letter from Mr. Yu Yixuan also stated that the rice shortage and early drought have come one after another. Women cry in the kitchen, and farmers sigh in the fields. The sad words are unbearable to read. We think of the Shangyu compatriots in Shanghai, most of whom are enlightened and generous. In this time of hardship in our hometown, with the people's lives hanging by a thread, we dare to ask you to give generously, widely appealing to everyone, to continue the survival of our community. Donations should be delivered to the Tongrun Qianzhuang at No. 13 Ji Yi Lane, Tianjin Road, or the Zi Ze Qianzhuang on Ningbo Road, and a receipt should be obtained."</p>
<p>Ningbo Fundraising Association Holds General Meeting Today</p>
<p>The Ningbo Price Stabilization Fundraising Association will hold a general meeting at the Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Association at 4:00 PM today. Association Chairman Yu Qiaqing has personally donated 100,000 yuan in national currency, and Vice Chairmen Qin Runqing and Zhang Jiguang have each pledged to raise 100,000 yuan to promote the cause. Various industries, such as the new medicine industry, the coal industry, the jewelry industry, and the sugar industry, have already collected significant amounts. The association's fundraising goal is a total of 1.5 million yuan. With the support of various sectors, it should not be difficult to exceed the original target. Today's general meeting will be attended by the Fenghua Shanghai Fellow Association. It is reported that the association has recently raised more than 200,000 yuan, and has sent commissioners Le Zhenbao, Mu Zixiang, and others to Ningbo to handle price stabilization. It is heard that the 20,000 bags of foreign rice loaded on the Glen Line are expected to arrive in Ningbo today and will be used for price stabilization immediately.</p>
<p>Dire Rice Shortage in Dinghai Shiqi</p>
<p>According to visitors from Dinghai, the county is isolated overseas, consisting of a group of islands. The entire territory is mostly mountainous with little farmland, and rice production is very low. The food needed by the people has always depended on supplies from other counties. Since the county seat fell, rice prices within the city have soared due to the disruption of transportation. In the rural areas, the county government has coordinated adjustments to stabilize prices. However, recently, due to the impact of soaring grain prices everywhere, the price of rice in the city has reached a record high of 73 yuan per picul. In the eastern township and various islands, it has also reached around 50 yuan. The food panic is becoming more serious.</p>
<p>Chen Xiaolu, the town head of Shiqi, came to Shanghai to raise funds to transport rice for disaster relief, as detailed in this newspaper. We now know that the town government sent an urgent telegram to Shanghai yesterday, saying that all the rice in the villages has run out, and the villagers are filling their stomachs with grass roots. Please quickly raise funds to purchase rice for relief. After receiving the telegram, Chen immediately asked the local tycoons Yuan Ludeng, Zhang Shenzhi, and Fang Jiaobo to assist, and they are actively soliciting donations from local villagers in Shanghai and enthusiastic people from all walks of life. Starting today, they have entrusted the Ningbo Gazette on Guizhou Road to collect donations on their behalf. Last night, Yang Zhishui donated 100 yuan and Li Shenru donated 50 yuan after hearing the news, and both were sent to the newspaper for collection.</p>
<h3>Labor Unrest at British Tram Company Branch Resolved</h3>
<p>The labor strike by 300 workers at the Kerr Road branch of the Shanghai British Tram Company last week has been resolved. The patrol officers stationed at each branch of the company have also been withdrawn.</p>
<h3>Schools and Entertainment Industry Mobilize to Support Road Safety Campaign; Cooperate to Intensify Publicity; 1 Million Leaflets for Each Group</h3>
<p>The Public Safety Week, initiated by the police authorities of both the Public and French Concessions this year, is scheduled to be held from the 17th to the 23rd of this month. The details of the strong support received from all walks of life have already been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday, Chen Xuanshan of the Education Department and Yao Jiakun of the General Traffic Department of the Public Works Department convened the principals of various middle schools at the Public Works Department School on Ximo Road to discuss everything. It was decided to send about 20 students from each of the "Safety Week" patrols to various designated locations to advise pedestrians and distribute leaflets. It is heard that armbands will be issued to the students by the General Traffic Department, and they can ride buses and trams free of charge during Safety Week. As for the radio stations, they have already been broadcasting the three safety records daily. The entertainment industry, such as Liu Ziyun, Zhang Yezhi, Li Zhuan, Huang Zhaolin, Dong Tianmin, and others, are also said to have been contacted by Yao to step up their publicity efforts during the period to reduce road accidents. A million leaflets are said to be needed for each group of pedestrians, car drivers, rickshaw pullers, rickshaw pullers, and small car drivers.</p>
<h3>French Concession Chinese Ratepayers Association's Warning Against Speculation and Monopoly: Shanghai Merchants and Citizens Should Uphold Native Land Salvation; Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Indeed Robust</h3>
<p>The French Concession Chinese Ratepayers Association issued a warning to merchants and citizens within the concession, stating: Since early May, the city's financial situation suddenly became turbulent, foreign exchange shrank drastically, and the market situation was chaotic. Many shops, using this as an excuse, competed to raise prices, with multiple increases a day, without end. However, upon investigation, the goods with raised prices were all acquired beforehand, bearing no relation to the drastic shrinkage of foreign exchange. This is very obvious. Now that foreign exchange has eased and the market has stabilized, there are hardly any cases of goods with past price increases returning to their original state. Therefore, raising prices is clearly speculative in nature, seeking undue profit, which is known to all. Merchants seeking profit is not something to be criticized, but only prioritizing profit, sucking the marrow of the bones, only seeking self-enrichment while placing the public in danger, and disregarding social safety is absurd and infuriating. In this extraordinary time, everything is difficult. All Chinese people should recognize their respective goals and at least create a position of native land salvation. What is the merchant's native land salvation? Not monopolizing, not hoarding, not speculating, and not raising prices. Not monopolizing, hoarding, speculating, or raising prices means not being a treacherous merchant, not being a social criminal, and being worthy of being a descendant of the Yellow Emperor. It is understood that the concession authorities in this city have established strict sanctions against those who monopolize, hoard, and speculate, and will implement them soon. Therefore, we dare to sincerely advise all merchants and citizens within the concession to immediately awaken, encourage each other, and restore the raised prices to their original state before May. Do not test the law and disregard it, which is deeply anticipated.</p>
<p>Stabilization Fund</p>
<p>According to the French-language Shanghai Daily, as generally known, the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee does indeed hold foreign exchange of £2 million or £2.5 million or more, sufficient to suppress speculators from causing too much trouble in June. According to market estimates, there are still 12 million US dollars of hot money circulating in the local market. It is now heard that of this amount, 5 million US dollars are in the hands of the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund, 3 million US dollars are in the hands of various banks, and only 4 million US dollars are in the hands of speculators. Based on this speculation, if the banks do not assist speculators, then the momentum of speculators has weakened, and the fund of the Stabilization Fund is extremely robust. If there are no unexpected rumors, then in June, the local foreign exchange market should be stable, as speculators will inevitably restrain themselves in this environment and dare not act arbitrarily.</p>
<p>Strict Inspection of Rice Weevils</p>
<p>The entire rice market in this city, after various rice industry groups devised methods for rectification, buying and selling by the same industry has gradually entered the right track. Regarding the stock of rice warehouses alone, according to the Bean and Rice Industry Association, there are now more than one million bags. Although this is a time of year when the old harvest is exhausted and the new one is not yet in, the rice price in Shanghai may turn to loosen. The reason is nothing more than the weather turning hot, and warehouse goods are prone to change, so major households have no intention of further hoarding. Currently, relevant rice industry groups are determined to strictly crack down on those who buy and sell repeatedly, seeking profit from the middle, in order to alleviate the burden on each firm. This is currently under discussion, and once it is ready, it will be announced to the market and implemented.</p>
<p>Impressions of Stopping Foreign Exchange Swaps</p>
<p>A recent issue of the English-language Financial and Commercial News reported that since the Sino-Foreign banks announced the suspension of foreign exchange swaps last week, the market has experienced chaos. According to the methods announced by the Sino-Foreign banks, after that, except for interbank lending or legitimate commercial transactions, foreign exchange swaps for speculators will be unanimously rejected. The majority opinion on this measure is that the banks are acting at the request of the Stabilization Committee, with the aim of</p>
<p>Cracking Down on Speculation</p>
<p>Stabilizing the exchange market. In principle, it should be supported by the public. The establishment of the Stabilization Fund, on the contrary, allows people to attack the exchange market, minimizing the opportunity for speculators to lose and maximizing the hope of profit, which is actually equivalent to encouraging speculation. In normal times, speculation is a two-sided approach (there is both buying and selling), so there is no need to force correction. However, at present, speculative actions tend to be one-sided, so it is necessary to correct them. However, whether the currently adopted method of refusing foreign exchange swaps can achieve the expected purpose,</p>
<p>Seems Uncertain</p>
<p>Foreign exchange swaps also have their needs in commerce, but compared with the needs in speculation, it is just a drop in the ocean. For swap transactions, some banks will accommodate those who can provide the name of the firm and indicate that it is for legitimate commercial purposes, which is contrary to the original purpose of refusing swap transactions. Even if all banks strictly comply with the refusal of swaps, it is not difficult to transfer swaps for customers by simultaneously buying and selling futures, as long as the exchange rate difference is not lower than one thirty-second of an English pound or one sixteenth of a US dollar. The result is just for brokers to</p>
<p>Increase Transactions</p>
<p>That's all. A banker once expressed the opinion that why can't the general depositors of banks use their deposits in the bank for foreign exchange arbitrage, which often has a weekly interest rate of around five or six points and has very little risk. Why can depositors only deposit cash into the bank, allowing the bank to use the deposits to engage in arbitrage? The new method can only attack speculators with weak financial resources and has little effect on large households. This kind of argument misunderstands the original intention of the Stabilization Committee. However, we cannot forget that there are many banks in Shanghai and</p>
<p>Operating Scope</p>
<p>Is also inconsistent. Those who operate normal deposit and loan businesses are naturally willing to see the elimination of speculation, but there are also banks that specialize in speculation. Once they cannot implement speculative tricks, they themselves will inevitably collapse. We have heard that although the principle of swap transactions has been abolished, market changes have been very small, and swaps are still convenient, but without this name. Selling and buying are only three minutes apart. There are those in the market who express absolute compliance with the rules, and their buying and selling are handled by separate banks, so people in the market are satisfied. The actual situation remains the same.</p>
<h3>Norwegian Merchant Wilhelm's Ships: Shipping Operations Concentrated in Shanghai: Over Sixty Ships are Extremely Large: The Last Ship Leaving Norway Arrives in Shanghai Today</h3>
<p>The British firm Butterfield &amp; Swire in this city has been operating the Daiping, Taiping, Taiyang, and Taiyi ships on the Pacific route for many years. After the outbreak of the Second European War, it happened that the Norwegian shipowner of the Pacific Line, Wilh Wilesen (transliteration), had many new ships completed. They originally planned to send the four Tai ships to Europe and the new ships to the Far East. Recently, due to the expansion of the European war, navigation to Europe is difficult. All of Wilhelm's ships have come and concentrated in Shanghai. The Pacific and other ships will also come to Shanghai soon. It is heard that Wilhelm's ships are</p>
<p>Solely Owned</p>
<p>There are over sixty ships, and the ship bodies are huge, with the largest tonnage being 11,334 tons and the smallest being 6,608 tons. They operate on global routes, and the Far East is entrusted to the British firm Butterfield &amp; Swire as the general agent. It is heard that after the fall of Norway, Norwegian ships all operate in their own country. Wilhelm's last</p>
<p>Norwegian</p>
<p>Ship, the Talieyrand, is expected to arrive in Shanghai this morning and is scheduled to dock at the Huashun Pier in Hongkou. The ship is carrying a large amount of steel materials and foreign paper, which can also be considered the last batch of Norwegian goods to arrive in Shanghai. Before the cessation of the European war, Norwegian ships can only take the Far East as their starting point. Also, the regular fast mail ship of the Swedish Postal Company,</p>
<p>The Kantiefotian, entered the port of Shanghai and docked at the Gonghexiang Pier at 2:30 PM yesterday. This is the last ship to come to Shanghai</p>
<p>One. The ship is carrying a total of 586 passengers, most of whom are Jewish refugees seeking refuge in Shanghai and overseas Chinese affected by the European war. In addition, due to the war, there are few goods, only 160 pieces, and a piece of mail sent from Europe on May 10. After the ship unloads passengers and goods,</p>
<p>Afterwards, it is scheduled to depart from Shanghai and return to Europe on the 9th (Sunday) at 10:00 AM, following the</p>
<p>Original Route, also calling at ports such as Hong Kong, Singapore, Manila, Mumbai, and Colombo, and returning to Genoa via the Suez Canal, with no changes. Upon arrival in Shanghai, it will enter</p>
<p>Stop and anchor, and will be slightly repaired, waiting for changes in the war situation to determine its future actions. If Italy joins the whirlpool of the European war, it may be requisitioned by the government. If news of Italy's participation in the war arrives while the ship is sailing from Shanghai to Europe, it will temporarily stay on the coast of a neutral country. However, this time, due to the intense European war and the tense situation in the Mediterranean, both passengers and goods are extremely light. Furthermore, according to news from foreign merchants in the shipping industry, the Hong Kong government</p>
<p>Recently issued a notice prohibiting the import of automobiles, wireless electrical equipment, and other parts. If they need to be transported, they must obtain a special permit from the Hong Kong government in advance and be given a passport before they can be transported in.</p>
<p>According to those in charge of the Shanghai Postal Administration, regardless of domestic and foreign mail delivery, the bureau handles it according to bureau</p>
<p>Regulations. Before receiving orders, it will still be sealed, sent, and transported on ships on time. European mail delivery currently has no problems and will still be transported via the Pacific and Suez lines. Currently, mail from Shanghai to European countries is all forwarded through Hong Kong, and all kinds of large and small postal parcels are also being collected and sent. In short, the post office will try to deliver within its capacity so that people in Shanghai can inquire about family news at any time. Although the bureau has temporarily suspended receiving parcels to Germany, if the sender indicates "Transferred through domestic postal routes" on the cover, and the domestic postal route is indeed passable, it can still be collected and sent, and sample postal parcels transported via Vietnam, containing German goods and sent from or consigned to German people, will be handled in the same way.</p>
<p>Although the European war is in full swing, postal delivery between Shanghai and Europe can still be carried out as usual.</p>
<h3>Musician Zhu Qidong's Reputation Overseas: For National Glory</h3>
<p>Mr. Zhu Qidong is a famous musician in Shanghai, the younger brother of Professor Zhu Xiluo, the conductor of the Youth Symphony Orchestra. Since going abroad last year and entering the Chicago Academy of Music in the United States to specialize in music, he has made rapid progress and is highly regarded by the faculty and students of the academy. In his spare time, he is often invited to perform in various places, receiving enthusiastic praise from the American people. It is heard that Mr. Zhu has been hired as the conductor of the Chicago Graham Church Orchestra. The orchestra has received good reviews every time it plays, adding a lot of glory to the country.</p>
<h3>German Intelligence Officer Receives Reporters: Changed to Embassy</h3>
<p>German Embassy intelligence officer Mr. Kordt reported at yesterday's reception for reporters that the Shanghai Municipal Council recently notified the International Hotel, specifically pointing out Article 5 of the hotel regulations, stating that any political or political discussion meetings may not be held in the hotel without prior permission from the Shanghai Municipal Council. Considering the situation of the hotel, next Thursday's reception will be changed to a gathering at the German Embassy at No. 2 Beijing Road.</p>

<h3>Butterfield &amp; Swire Steamboat Company: Stevedores' Strike: Workers Demand Wage Increase from Foremen: Import and Export of All Ships Stalled</h3>
<p>The British firm Butterfield &amp; Swire Steamboat Company has 46 oceangoing vessels and 18 river steamers, with routes covering various ports along the Yangtze River, the coast of China, and various ports in Southeast Asia. Before the founding of the Republic of China, it once sent ships to operate on the China-Japan route. After the Japanese established Nippon Yusen Kaisha (i.e., Toyo Kisen Kaisha), the company's China-Japan route was excluded. The company can be called the largest organization among British shipping companies in China. Since the outbreak of the August 13th Sino-Japanese War, the Yangtze River steamers have been forced to suspend sailing. They have relied on the prosperous business of the Southeast Asia route, and have not actually suffered losses. Because freight rates have repeatedly increased, and since the change to collecting Hong Kong dollars last year, the surplus is even more abundant than before the incident. The company provides Chinese employees with allowances in addition to their salaries. As for the import and export of various ships,</p>
<p>Cargo Loading and Unloading</p>
<p>Crane workers on the ships, in the hold, and on deck are contracted by Wang Asong of Changshun Warehouse and Guo Jiaji of Lianxin Warehouse to hire workers. Yesterday afternoon, around 1:00 PM, a labor dispute suddenly occurred. The workers demanded a wage increase from the contractors but were unsuccessful, so they immediately stopped work and went on strike. The workers gathered in Pudong for a meeting, and the situation was tense. According to the contractors, the workers' representatives verbally demanded an increase of 30% per worker, plus 80 cents for meals. The demanded amount was too far apart, and they were unable to bear it. Moreover, on February 10 of this year, both parties signed an agreement to increase wages by 440 cash, plus 150 cash for night meals, totaling a wage of one yuan and nine cents per worker.</p>
<p>Agreement Contents</p>
<p>Article 2 states that from the date of the treaty, the labor side may not demand a price increase again within six months, no matter how high prices rise. Considering that prices are rising and life is indeed difficult, wages are still paid at the highest price of other wharves in the city, but work must also be done according to the methods of other wharves. It is learned that there is a big difference in the work aspect, and the workers cannot accept it, so they went on strike abruptly. Therefore, from 2:00 PM yesterday, work at the Butterfield &amp; Swire Wharf was completely suspended. The Hunan ship was originally scheduled to leave for Yantai and Tianjin this afternoon, but because no one was loading goods, it is</p>
<p>Feared that it will be difficult to export today</p>
<p>The Yingzhou and Qiongzhou ships, which arrived in Shanghai from South China yesterday afternoon, docked at the company's wharves No. 1 and 2 in the French Concession, but were also unable to unload their cargo. It is heard that the two ships also brought in a large batch of foreign rice. According to general speculation, the above-mentioned disputes may be difficult to resolve for a while. It is heard that after the workers met in Pudong yesterday, they will probably submit a written request to the two contractors, Wang Asong and Guo Jiaji, again today. There are more than 500 workers, but if this is prolonged, ships will not be able to load or unload cargo, delaying the schedule, and the company will suffer huge losses. For the sake of both parties, the company and the contractors should consider it.</p>
<p>Police Protection</p>
<p>Also, it is reported that there are a total of 400 to 500 stevedores at the British firm Butterfield &amp; Swire Wharf in the French Concession. They originally belonged to a contracting system, and the contractors are Wang Asong and Li Shibai. The daily wage for these workers is one yuan and eight cents. Recently, due to the high cost of living, they are unable to maintain their livelihoods. At 12:00 PM yesterday, they went on strike together and elected eight representatives, Zhu Dingxiang, Zhou Guangcai, Sun Kehua, Geng San, Hu Zhaoyang, Yu Jianian, Ding Duzhen, and Lao Wei, to demand a 50% wage increase from the contractors, as well as a daily meal allowance of 80 cents and a night meal allowance of 40 cents, to maintain their livelihoods. The customs water patrol police and the French police were dispatched to protect them separately. The workers are waiting for a reply, while the contractors need to negotiate with the factory again, so it was delayed until the evening and has not been resolved. There are also more than 500 coolies carrying bags, who are also unable to work because there is no one to load or unload. The work of loading and unloading cargo on the three ships Hunan, Qiongzhou, and Yingzhou, which were docked at the wharf, was completely at a standstill yesterday afternoon.</p>
<h3>Simmons' Injury is Trending Towards Recovery</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Garrison Commander, Mr. Simmons, suffered a fracture on the previous day (5th) due to a fall while playing polo. He was treated at the Hong En Hospital, and his injury is trending towards recovery. He should be able to leave the hospital in a few days. It is said that Mr. Simmons is in a very cheerful spirit and continues to exercise his authority as commander of the garrison in the hospital, issuing necessary orders from time to time.</p>
<h3>Member of the Puppet Military Committee, Wen Yingbiao, Shot: Bullet Hit a Vital Point and His Injury is Very Critical: The Two Shooters Escaped Without a Trace</h3>
<p>At around 6:00 AM yesterday morning, a shooting incident suddenly occurred at No. 47 Daodeli, Beile Road, in the French Concession. The person shot was Wen Yingbiao, a member of the puppet military committee, who was shot once on the spot, hitting a vital point, and his life is in great danger. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Holding a Puppet Position: Actually a New Noble</p>
<p>Wen Yingbiao, a native of Guangdong, is 38 years old this year. In his youth, he studied in Austria. He is the nephew of Wen Zongyao, the current president of the puppet legislative yuan of the puppet organization in Jiangning. He is a large man, resembling a brawny man. When Cai Jingjun was the director of the municipal public security bureau, Wen served as an inspector in the inspection department and later rose to the position of director of the foreign affairs section of the department. In the 26th year of the Republic of China, he was transferred to the police station on Wenmiao Road in Nanshi. After the outbreak of the Shanghai War, his attitude suddenly changed. He once held a position in the puppet police station in Pudong. He is currently a member of the puppet military committee. Recently, he was sent to Guangzhou by the puppet regime to serve as the "Principal of the Military Branch School," but has not yet taken office.</p>
<p>Awakened from a Dream: Bullets Suddenly Came</p>
<p>His family resides at No. 47 Daodeli, the intersection of Beile Road and Kaizier Road, in the French Concession, living with his concubine, Ms. Li (22 years old). The night before, Wen and Ms. Li were sleeping together in a small room behind the living room of the house. At around 6:00 AM yesterday morning, two men wearing Western suits suddenly came and knocked on the door, claiming to "visit Mr. Wen Yingbiao." At that time, the maid, Ms. Xu Liu (a native of Jiangbei, 30 years old), opened the door. The men said, "Mr. Wen is not here." Just as the two young men were about to leave, Wen woke up in his sleep, put on his clothes, and went out to check. Unexpectedly, the young men saw him and, without asking any questions, drew their pistols and fired. Wen was caught off guard, and the bullet hit Wen's chest, penetrating his back. Wen fell to the ground after being injured. The maid, Ms. Xu, stood at the door in shock, as if turned to wood. The shooters, seeing that their goal had been achieved, fled out the door and disappeared. When his concubine, Ms. Li, heard the alarm and got up, the shooters had already disappeared.</p>
<p>Sent to the Hospital for Treatment: Life is in Great Danger</p>
<p>She then reported to the French police, who urgently ordered a large number of detectives to rush to the scene. They found Wen lying in a pool of blood at the doorway, barely breathing. Because the Nanyang Hospital was nearby, they borrowed its ambulance and rushed him to Ward No. 214 of the Baolong Hospital for treatment. Because the injury was very serious, his life was in danger. Afterwards, the Daodeli police constable, Zhu Denglu, arrested a suspect in the alley and seized a live ammunition pistol. According to the suspect, Wang Keren (23 years old, a native of Wuxi), the French police are currently investigating.</p>
<h3>Abortion Caused Death: Midwife Arrested Pending Investigation</h3>
<p>A Ningbo woman, Gui Xu, residing at No. 324 Jiaxiyi Road in the French Concession, is 24 years old. Her husband works on an ocean-going ship and they have a seven-month-old child. Recently, she suddenly became pregnant again, so at 4:00 PM on the 1st of this month, she went to Gao Amao (also known as Little Old Lady), a Changshu midwife who has a flat in Fangjiazhai, Chengdu Road, to request an abortion. Gao performed the surgery, using a grass root to induce the abortion. Ms. Gui then temporarily resided in a room in the Qinghe Hostel in Qinghefang, Zhejiang Road. On the 2nd, the male fetus in her womb was aborted, but it was already dead, so she discarded it in the chamber pot. Unexpectedly, although the fetus was aborted, Ms. Gui suffered from blood poisoning, causing a serious illness. She then went to the Guangren Hospital for treatment. The doctor confirmed the abortion and reported it to the Chengdu Road police station. Detective Wang Bingtan was dispatched to arrest Gao Amao and take her to the police station. Yesterday morning, she was escorted to the Second Criminal Division of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated the case and requested a postponement. After questioning by Judge Xiao, he ordered her to be detained for seven days pending further investigation.</p>
<h3>Kidnapping of Leather Factory Owner: Two Criminals Arrested: Zhou Xilian and Ni Wenhuan Detained Pending Investigation: Nine Suspects Found Not Guilty and Released</h3>
<p>Gu Huanzhang, the owner of the Gongyi Leather Factory at No. 1097 Connaught Road and a native of Nanxiang, was kidnapped by bandits at 10:30 PM on April 8 and hidden somewhere in western Shanghai. They sent a letter demanding a ransom of 35,000 yuan, otherwise his life would be in danger. The words were very intense. Afterwards, Gu's family paid the ransom. They then reported the situation to the Gordon Road police station, which had jurisdiction over the area. After investigation by Chinese detective Wang Chengying and detectives Sun Jianwen and Xu Decheng, the criminals, Zhou Xilian, a local, and Ni Wenhuan, a native of Jiangbei, were arrested along with nine suspects, Qu Liangcai, Qin Zurong, Pan Hongshou, Huang Weichuan, Wang Jiayun, Li Linsen, Huang Yougan, Xiang Guirong, and Sun Wenzhang, at Room No. 1 of the Lao Jinlong Hotel at No. 400 Yuqiaxiang Road. They were taken to the police station and sent to the First Special Court, requesting detention. Qu Liangcai and the other nine hired lawyers Wang Yaotang, Fan Gang, and Yu Enliang to defend them. The court adjourned the hearing for further investigation. During the adjournment, the police found that Qu Liangcai and the others were not actually involved. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Third Criminal Division. Police lawyer Jiang Baolian stated that Zhou Xilian and Ni Wenhuan were being prosecuted for kidnapping and extortion, while the others were found not guilty and requested to be released. Judge Jiang Shuzi briefly questioned the defendants and ordered Zhou and Ni to be remanded in custody. The other nine, Qu Liangcai and the others, were released after the police withdrew the prosecution.</p>
<h3>Comprador of Old Cathay Insurance Department, Chen Shangda, Kidnapped: Gangsters Previously Seized a Yunfei Taxi: Drove Off Towards Western Shanghai After the Kidnapping</h3>
<p>A kidnapping case suddenly occurred at Zhangjiazhaikou, Avenyue Edward VII, at around 8:30 AM yesterday. The person kidnapped was Chen Shangda, the comprador of the Old Cathay (康記) Insurance Department in this city. He was forcibly put into a Yunfei taxi and driven off to the west. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Going to the Office</p>
<p>Chen Shangda, a native of Cixi, Ningbo, is 52 years old. He resides at No. 60, Lane 73, Zhangjiazhaikou, Avenyue Edward VII. He has been working as a comprador for the British firm Old Cathay (康記) Insurance Department at No. 17 Guangdong Road for more than ten years. When Chen was young, he was a trainee in the firm. Because of his diligent work, he was promoted to employee and then to comprador. He currently goes in and out in taxi No. 1799, driven by Pei Shisong (37 years old, a native of Jiangbei). Yesterday morning, around 8:30 AM,</p>
<p>Set off to the office. He was pulled out of Zhangjiazhaikou to the entrance of the Youhua Taxi Company, when a Yunfei taxi No. 12344, which had been seized by bandits, was parked on the side of the road. Seeing Chen's taxi approaching, the gangsters in the car also started the engine and moved slowly. The two cars were side by side.</p>
<p>Forcibly Boarded the Car</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, when the car reached the intersection of Avenyue Edward VII, two gangsters suddenly flashed out from the right side of the road and used their hands to block the taxi's bumper. Another person wearing a long robe on the left side showed a pistol, slapped the taxi driver Pei Shisong, and threatened him to stop. Pei, intimidated by the threat, put down the bumper and stood aside in a daze. One of the bandits kicked him and told him to leave quickly. Then, Chen was dragged out of the taxi, forcibly put into taxi No. 12344, and driven off to the west.</p>
<p>Bandits Disappeared</p>
<p>After the incident, taxi driver Pei Shisong rushed back to his home and reported the information to his family, who then reported it to the Xinzha Police Station, which dispatched a large number of Chinese and Western detectives to rush to the scene. However, the bandits had disappeared without a trace. The police are currently investigating. It is learned that before the January 28th Incident, Chen lived near the early bridge in Zhabei. He then moved to that place. He has seven children, and the youngest is still in swaddling clothes. Because he has a large family to feed, he has no savings. It is heard that Chen earns a salary of 300 yuan a month, which is just a nominal amount, with no real substance.</p>
<p>Robbery of the Car</p>
<p>It is also learned that at around 6:30 AM yesterday morning, a customer suddenly came to the Yunfei Taxi Branch on Jing'an Temple Road. The taxi driver, Tan Maodi (48 years old, local), drove taxi No. 12344 to the entrance of the Qingnian Primary School Alley in Fanwangdu. The customer ordered the car to turn around and stop, and told him to go into the alley with him to retrieve a box. Tan did not suspect anything and followed him inside. Unexpectedly, before he had gone far, four men in short clothes suddenly emerged from the alley. Two of them were holding weapons and forbade him to shout. They then stripped off his uniform and another bandit put it on.</p>
<p>Returned Afterwards</p>
<p>Coincidentally, behind that place was the Zhaofeng Garden. Three people were monitoring him and escorted him around the garden. The other two drove the car away. More than two and a half hours later, the car returned to its original location. After meeting the three bandits in the garden, they said to the taxi driver that the car was on Dunxin Road, and he could go and drive it back. At this time, Tan broke free and rushed to that place. He indeed saw the original car parked there, so he drove it back to the taxi company and immediately reported the situation to the police station. It has been confirmed that the car was used by the bandits to kidnap Chen Shangda.</p>
<h3>Hidden Opium Within Soap</h3>
<p>Central Police Narcotics Department detective Liu Zhaonian received a tip from an informant stating that a drug trafficker would be passing by the intersection of Machen Road and Wuding Road around 7:30 AM yesterday, carrying a large quantity of opium. He, along with detective chief Ye Yusi, detectives Guo Shouxin, and Wang Shusen, went to the location on time to stake out the area. They saw Yao Baoxing, a man from Qingpu, carrying two large bars of soap, approaching. His demeanor seemed suspicious, so they arrested him. Inside the specially made soap, they found twenty-eight taels of opium, worth over a thousand yuan. He was taken to the Xinzha precinct for detention, pending transfer to the First Special Court for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Old Copper and Tin Industry Guild Requests the Abolition of Illegal Fees</h3>
<p>The Old Copper and Tin Industry Guild of this city recently noted that its members are facing extreme difficulties in making a living. Therefore, the standing committee members Lü Deyou, Chen Wenmai, and Wang Hanqing convened a meeting of supervisors and directors. They decided to abolish all "illegal fees," in order to rectify industry practices and ease the burden on members. They submitted a document to the authorities of the two concessions yesterday, requesting approval for the record and formally abolishing the illegal fees. At the same time, all members were notified to comply with the implementation.</p>
<h3>Lost Savings Passbook</h3>
<p>A ten-year fixed savings passbook from the Four Banks Joint Savings Society was found yesterday afternoon on Nanjing Road, without any specimen signature. Payment can be made upon presentation of the passbook. The loser, if they can state the account holder's name, the amount, and the maturity date, can claim the passbook from Mr. Bo Shude of the towel department at the China National Goods Company.</p>
<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>With utmost respect, we read in your newspaper's local news column of June 5th the statement that "The company's workers demanded a 30% wage increase, which was rejected by the factory, and the factory gates were closed, preventing workers from entering to work," which greatly surprised us. Upon investigation, we found that at noon on the 5th, three workers, Chen Wenyuan, Xu Dinggao, and Wang Yizhen, coerced all the workers into going on strike. After investigation by the factory, the three workers were dismissed. At the same time, the remaining workers resumed normal work. The three workers then resorted to violence, intimidating other workers and preventing them from working, and coercing the factory manager to increase wages by 30%. Such unreasonable behavior disrupted work, and we reported this to the Chengdu Road Police Station, requesting protection. The three workers then left. In summary, the facts are significantly different from what was reported. Accordingly, we request a correction. Respectfully, The Editorial Department of Shen Bao, China Yilin Color Printing Co., Ltd., June 6th.</p>
<h3>Weather Report</h3>
<p>The Xujiahui Observatory issued a weather forecast at 4:30 PM yesterday, stating that Shandong and surrounding areas are clear with fog, and strong southwest to northwest winds. Here and in the East China Sea, it is cloudy with morning fog and no prevailing wind direction. There is rainfall in South China. Also, in the 24 hours before 3:00 PM yesterday, the highest temperature in this city was 80.1 degrees, and the lowest was 65.7 degrees. There are no records for the same day last year.</p>

<h3>Recent Events at West Lake</h3>
<p>West Lake in Hangzhou, also known as Xizi Lake and Golden Ox Lake, is renowned both domestically and internationally for its beautiful scenery. The Three Pools Mirroring the Moon is one of the ten scenic spots, with its pavilions and waterside gazebos, green railings and red balustrades, surrounded by lotus ponds and connected by small bridges, making it a prime location for escaping the summer heat. After the ravages of war, the former Governor of Hunan, Lord Xiangxiang, Jiang, oversaw its reconstruction, making it even grander than before. To the east of this location, leading in through a small bridge, is the Tuixing Hermitage, which is the villa of Grand Tutor Peng Xueqin. During breaks from inspecting the river and reviewing military affairs, the Grand Tutor would always spend a month or so here. He had previously requested permission from the court to use it as a place to recuperate, like He Jizhen's Jian Lake. At that time, Yu Yinfu of Deqing, the former Education Commissioner of Henan, was in charge of the Bo Gu Jing 精舍 Academy. The students of the academy pooled money and hired workers to build the Yu Building to the east of the academy, as a place for the commissioner to rest when he came to the province. It was completed last winter. The commissioner went to Hangzhou last month to start teaching and, at the request of his disciples, set up his bed there. The building is located with its back to the mountain and facing the water, with the entire lake in view, fully showcasing the beauty of the lake. The Grand Tutor, who was recuperating at the Tuixing Hermitage, was delighted to hear of the commissioner's arrival and happily rowed over. The commissioner also visited the Grand Tutor from time to time. The two locations are only separated by the Su Causeway, making it easy to travel back and forth. Those who admire them say that the Gods of Literature and Talent are gazing at each other across the water, truly like the Northern and Southern Peaks standing side by side. The Grand Tutor departed on the 23rd of last month, and the commissioner also returned to Suzhou on the same day.</p>

<h3>Saving Life (2)</h3>
<p>However, we must understand that Christ never said that all worldly things are inherently bad. He did not condemn people for having families, love, happiness, art, beauty, science, knowledge, and all other activities related to life. Nor did he command people to reject all these activities. Instead, he told us that if people make these things the greatest purpose of their lives, they will lose them all. Conversely, if people are not enslaved by these things, but are willing to lose them all for the sake of Christ and his blessings, they can save them. This is truly an unbreakable truth. Someone once said, "I am a Christian because being a Christian is very interesting." This is true. Ordinary irreligious people see life as boring, but it is not life that is so, but rather that they are indulging in alcohol, sex, movies, and dancing, losing their lives, so they see life as boring. Christians are not like that. They see life as very interesting because they believe that the results of their actions will not end with their own lives, but will affect future generations. They see their own lives as a drama, with God and angels as the audience. When they perform well, God is pleased for them, and when they perform poorly, God is sad for them. They see all their activities as having a noble meaning. They offer art and beauty to God for praise and worship. They see knowledge and science as proof of God's great wisdom and power. They see God as the source of love, light, truth, power, and life, so their outlook on life is full of interest. In short, what Christ said has an unbreakable truth. If we seek entertainment etc. for our own sake, we will not only fail to obtain the true happiness of entertainment, but will also suffer mental pain and lose our original life. If we sacrifice our happiness for the sake of righteousness, we will not only save all that we originally had, but also gain new interests, new happiness, new hope—new life. (The End)</p>

<h3>Telephone Shortage</h3>
<p>— Previous Experience</p>
<p>Because the demand for telephones exceeds the supply, a new business of "selling telephone subscriptions" has emerged, with each subscription costing as much as two or three thousand yuan. Although the telephone company authorities have published advertisements, to strictly prohibit this practice, it is all done privately, making it impossible to prevent, and leading to even worse malpractices. Because after the buyer and seller have reached a deal, the "relocation" of the telephone still has to go through the company's procedures, even the original subscriber is extorted for huge sums of money when moving and having the telephone removed. Yesterday's local news column in this newspaper contained a report on a case of extortion that was cracked, in which most of the defendants were employees of the company.</p>
<p>Privately selling telephone subscriptions violates the telephone company's regulations, and the telephone company's employees are taking advantage of this weakness to extort money. This is not only "deception and extortion" but also "aiding and abetting the wicked," because the telephone company's inability to prohibit "selling telephone subscriptions" is probably due to problems with the "relocation" procedure. In the future, the company authorities only need to pay attention to investigate when someone requests to move or remove a telephone, to determine whether it is the "original subscriber's telephone" or a "telephone subscription that has been sold," which would be much more effective than publishing advertisements.</p>
<p>At the same time, the author also thought of another problem, which is that new telephone equipment will soon arrive in Shanghai. It is said that once the telephone lines are fully equipped, new telephones can be installed within the year. However, according to a friend who requested to have a telephone installed and went to register, the number of registered users may exceed the number of new telephones, so the company should investigate the order of registration in advance (the receipt has a number) and proceed accordingly. Otherwise, the "first installation" and "later installation" will still give unscrupulous people the opportunity to profit from it.</p>
<h3>Protect Library Books</h3>
<p>— New Dream</p>
<p>A few days ago, I read a notice from the New Asia Library in this newspaper, which stated in essence that the books borrowed from the library recently have often been found to be damaged, such as having pages torn out or having arbitrary comments written on them, making it impossible to prevent. This is indeed a heartbreaking thing.</p>
<p>Not only the New Asia Library, we know that similar things happen in general libraries, especially in school libraries. As soon as the newspapers arrive, the reviews are cut out, and a hole is cut out of the supplement. In less than half a day, a newspaper is torn to pieces, with little left. Although this is for personal preferences and the need to clip and store them, do not forget that the library is public and cannot be cut off for your own private use, making it impossible for others to read it. Other things, such as borrowing books and not returning them, and writing words and sentences on books, are also often discovered.</p>
<p>Public property should be cherished by everyone, especially the books and newspapers in the library, and should not be arbitrarily damaged in the slightest, so that everyone can see them. Therefore, the author hopes that everyone who goes to the library or borrows books from the library can cherish the books and newspapers even more than their own books and newspapers. Because if your own books and newspapers are damaged, only you will be affected and harmed, but if the books and newspapers in the library are damaged, countless people will be affected and harmed. Everyone should get rid of this bad habit!</p>
<h3>Scolding "Dai" and Teaching Theft</h3>
<p>— Chen Lin</p>
<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p>At around nine o'clock this morning, I had an important matter to attend to in the Eight Immortals Bridge area. While passing through the intersection of Mintiniyin Road and Ningbo Road, I saw a woman wearing a silk Indian cheongsam, with her hair permed and wearing high-heeled leather shoes. She was holding the hand of a boy of eight or nine years old, and behind them were two men in their twenties. One was wearing a Mandarin gown, and the other was wearing a beige suit. Both were wearing felt hats and leather shoes. As the woman approached the turning point, I suddenly saw the two men pounce on her, one holding down her throat and right hand, and the other snatching the diamond ring and watch from her left hand. Then they pushed the woman to the ground and fled westward. The woman got up from the ground and shouted to catch the thieves, but the thieves had already disappeared. The boy stood there crying blankly. The onlookers crowded around to watch the excitement, and I left amidst the noise.</p>
<p>I would like to advise the ladies and gentlemen of Shanghai that there are many thieves in the city now, and people are being robbed even on the streets during the day. We can only be frugal and simple, and not lose our belongings for the sake of beauty and showing off, and also be frightened. Do you think it's worth it?</p>

<p>Hawthorne's Case</p>
<h3>The Ballerina's Ending</h3>
<p>— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter One: "A Very Pretty Lady!"</p>
<p>Anna also said, "Mr. Hawthorne, if you can catch the murderer, I am willing to reward you handsomely. I heard that you are an omnipotent detective!"</p>
<p>Hawthorne hurriedly returned his head to a normal state. "What are you talking about!—Omnipotent? Who is omnipotent? Sorry, I can't stand it." Hawthorne shook his head repeatedly, an uncomfortable look on his face, still exhaling from his cigarette.</p>
<p>Hawthorne never liked unreasonable flattery, let alone the word "omnipotent," which exceeded the limit of flattery.</p>
<p>Anna said in a trembling voice, "Mr. Hawthorne, Lilan died miserably and very strangely. Even if you don't do it for the reward, you must put some effort into finding out the truth of this case for the tragic death of a poor woman."</p>
<p>Her voice was almost begging. Moreover, the word "strange" also touched Hawthorne's curiosity.</p>
<p>Hawthorne said seriously, "Okay, I'll take a look. Where is she?"</p>
<p>"She died at her home at No. 27 Qingpu Road. She originally had no relatives at home... There is currently an uncle-in-law, named Li Zhiban."</p>
<p>"Did this uncle-in-law tell you?"</p>
<p>"No, Jinmei called me—Jinmei is Lilan's maid. As soon as I received her call, I rushed over. She died so tragically!"</p>
<p>Hawthorne sat up straight, held the cigarette between two fingers, and looked at me, as if hinting that if I intended to go with him, I had to change my clothes immediately. I felt that there was no need to say goodbye to this Jiang Anna, so I walked out of the office door to the upstairs. As I was going up the stairs, I heard Anna speaking again. (7)</p>

<h3>General Review of the Five Classes of Talent at Fuliancheng (1)</h3>
<p>— Only Me</p>
<p>Preamble: The Ke Ban Opera School in Beiping is the only Peking Opera actor training institute in China. Almost all of today's famous performers were trained by Fuliancheng. However, in the past two or three decades, among the performers who have come out of Fuliancheng and become leading actors, from the Xi generation to the Shi generation, there has only been one person in each class: Xi generation: Tan Xinxi; Lian generation: Ma Lianliang; Fu generation: Tan Fuying; Sheng generation: Li Shenghao; and Shi generation: Mao Shilai. Coincidentally, four out of these five people sing Lao Sheng roles (old male roles), and only Mao Shilai, the Shi generation, is a Dan role (female role).</p>
<p>According to current surveys, only Xu Xifu, Hou Xi , and Chen Xixing, remain active among the first Xi generation of Fuliancheng graduates. The number of Lian and Dang generation graduates is also declining. The Sheng and Shi generations are the most widely dispersed. The Sheng generation, led by Li Shenghao, performed in Shanghai after graduation, leaving a deep impression on Shanghai audiences. The Shi generation graduated recently, and few have come to Shanghai. Therefore, Shanghai residents may not be familiar with them. Here is a summary of the talent produced by this class:</p>
<p>Sheng Role (Male Role): The Shi generation produced the most talent in Xusheng (bearded male) roles. Li Shilin is the oldest and earliest to emerge among them. Li Shilin switched to Yinglizi (clown) roles soon after learning opera. (This person came to Shanghai last year with Wang Yurong.) Later, Liu Shixun, Yu Shilong, and Wang Shixu performed formal Laosheng opera at Hehelou (a theater where Fuliancheng performers played). These three were all skilled during their training, and people predicted that they would become the next Ma (Lianliang) and Tan (Fuying). In particular, Shixun and Shilong were skilled in singing, reciting, acting, and performance. However, unexpectedly, these three suddenly had voice problems before graduating, which resulted in failing before success and never becoming famous. To this day, their voices have not recovered, so they all stay at home in Beiping. After Liu Shixun and others had voice problems, Sha Shixin, Ye Shichang, and Chi Shigong replaced them. Although these three seemed to replace Liu, Yu, and Wang at the time, only Sha Shixin was actually popular. Ye Shichang and Chi Shigong were both very reluctant. After graduation, Shixin first joined a major troupe and came south to cooperate with Mao Shilai. Unexpectedly, he failed to make a name for himself in Shanghai. As a result of the circumstances, Chi Shigong and Ye Shichang surpassed Shixin. In terms of art, Shigong is currently the best (he is currently working with Song Dezhu and Gou Lingxiang). Shichang learns from Ma Lianliang and excels in acting and body movements. His voice is not very loud. However, as Shichang is a junior figure in Fuliancheng, his future may be better than that of Shigong. Li Shiqi, who is currently performing on stage, originally studied martial Laosheng roles but later switched to Yinglizi roles and is a promising talent. In addition, there is also Li Shizhang, who is also a Yinglizi Laosheng. All the Yinglizi Laosheng produced by the Shi generation are named Li (Shilin, Shiqi, Shizhang), which often confuses people. It is also a coincidence. As for Wusheng (martial male) roles in the Shi generation, there is a great lack of talent. During their training, there were only Jiang Shisheng and Gao Shishou. Gao Shishou is the son of Gao Qingkui and was also a promising talent, but unfortunately, he did not strive to improve, so he gave up halfway. Now he has been reduced to a second-rate Wusheng. (Shishou is currently with his elder brother Shenglin and has come south with Shenglin several times.) Jiang Shisheng is quite skilled and excels in short-fighting plays. Although he has graduated, he has not yet joined a troupe. Because there is a lack of Wusheng talent in Fuliancheng's Shi generation, Shisheng is regarded as a rare gem. As for Xiaosheng (young male) roles, Jiang Shiyu is one of the best. Although his skill is difficult to compare with that of Ye Shengzhu, he is also a rare talent. There is also Zhang Shixiao (who came to Shanghai with Xu Yingwen before but failed to attract attention). He originally played Dan roles but later switched to Xiaosheng roles. After Jiang Shiyu graduated, Shixiao replaced Shiyu in performing Xiaosheng operas. His skill is acceptable. In addition, there is Zhu Shifen, who is only mediocre.</p>
<h3>Peking Opera at the Hualian Tongle Society</h3>
<p>— Planned Success</p>
<p>The Hualian Tongle Society aims to connect feelings, study art, cultivate the mind and body, improve life, and promote proper entertainment. Yesterday, the society held its fourth membership drive, with hundreds of people attending. After Mr. Yuan Ludeng reported the purpose of the meeting, members of the society's Peking Opera group performed three Peking Opera excerpts to add to the enjoyment. On the stage, there were two black-letter banners on red satin, one saying "Music Plays Jun Tian," and the other saying "Music Corrects Righteousness and Values Weight." There were also couplets that read, "Depicting the past, hoping to use joy and sorrow to encourage loyalty and filial piety"; "Singing heroically, daring to say that entertainment forgets worries and danger!" They were donated by Mr. Chen Lianzhang. The first excerpt was *Hong Bi Xi*. It started with the scene where she begged in the snow and ended with the beating in the bridal chamber. Ms. Cheng Zizhen played Jin Yu Nu. Her appearance was beautiful, and her voice was sweet and smooth. When she opened the door and saw her father lying in the snow, she felt pity for his suffering and asked him to enter the house and gave him leftover food. Soon, she heard him talk about his life. She admired his talent and hoped to marry him, but she was too shy to say so. She perfectly depicted the mentality of a young girl and can be said to have acted with great expression. Later, in the second bridal chamber scene, she recounted her husband's past misdeeds. She was righteous and strict. When she spoke of where his conscience was, she gritted her teeth and was extremely resentful. The audience was moved by her performance and thought that it was too cheap to only punish him with a beating. Shi Guangyu's Mo Ji was excellent in both singing and acting, which enhanced the performance. The second excerpt was *Begging for Fishing Tax and Killing the Family*. Ying Wenyuan's Xiao En was skilled and experienced. Li Yaozu's Guiying was innocent and lively. Shen Juemin's teacher was ridiculous and funny. All of them were equally skilled and wonderful. The third excerpt was *The Drunken Concubine*. Zhai Zhibi played the Concubine Yang. She was dignified and gorgeous. Her body movements were like a willow in the wind, floating like a fairy, making people dizzy. When she teased the eunuch, her eyes were blurred with drunkenness, which was also acted appropriately. It is rare to find such talent among amateur performers. Therefore, the applause was thunderous, and the gongs stopped at midnight.</p>
<h3>Theater News</h3>
<p>— Xia</p>
<p>Since its establishment, the Lido Drama Society, under the leadership of President Gao Hang, has been actively preparing for its trial performance. The society's actors are mostly basic actors from the Guohua and Minhua film companies, and the lineup is quite strong. It is rumored that they will perform in a major theater in this city in mid-July.</p>
<h3>New Four Thousand Golds</h3>
<p>— Xing</p>
<p>Guohua's new work</p>
<p>After completing *Black Paradise*, Wu Cun intends to continue developing fashion films. It is rumored that he has decided that his next new work will be *New Four Thousand Golds*. Zhou Xuan and Zhou Manhua have been tentatively selected as the main actors. Wu Cun had previously directed the film *Four Thousand Golds* before the war, starring Bai Yang, Gong Qiuxia, Shu Xiuwen, and Huang Naishuang. The tone was light and cheerful, reminiscent of Hollywood works.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Theater Arts Society: Searching for Scripts, Cao Yu Sent One</h3>
<p>After *Thunderstorm*, *Sunrise*, and *Wilderness*, Cao Yu's new work *Metamorphosis* has been sent to Shanghai. This new work will undoubtedly be enthusiastically supported by Shanghai audiences. In addition, Zhang Junxiang, who recently returned from studying drama in the United States, also sent a script called *The Story of a Small City*, which is his friend's masterpiece and a very excellent script. In addition, playwrights from the mainland have all sent letters to the Shanghai Theater Arts Society, promising to submit scripts within a short period of time. On the other hand, to encourage new writers, the society is establishing a script prize to welcome external submissions (the society's basic and special playwrights are not allowed to participate). The prizes are set at 500 yuan, 300 yuan, and 200 yuan. There will definitely be a lot of submissions in this area. In addition, technical personnel and actors are being sought from all over.</p>

<h3>Gone with the Wind (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Yao Senyuan</p>
<p>"Gone With the Wind" by Margaret Mitchell</p>
<p>One day, Scarlett's father came home and said that Ashley and Melanie would announce their engagement tomorrow at Twelve Oaks Plantation. Upon hearing this, she felt deeply distressed. She hadn't expected this news to actually become a reality. She thought there must be a reason, surely because she hadn't expressed her love for him. Moreover, she often treated him with a "touch-me-not" attitude. Naturally, he would marry Melanie out of disappointment. So, she planned to come up with a way to prevent them from getting engaged tomorrow, and thus didn't sleep all night. The next day, she went with her parents and two younger sisters to Twelve Oaks, where she met Melanie's brother Charles Hamilton's fiancée, Frank, and Rhett Butler, among others. These were many of the people she didn't want to associate with, because she was eagerly looking for Ashley. She searched for a long time, but couldn't find him. Later, she met Charles, who told her that the Civil War was about to break out and Lincoln was recruiting soldiers. He spoke excitedly, but he didn't know that Scarlett wasn't interested in the slightest. Suddenly, Charles proposed to Scarlett. This sudden proposal left her speechless for a moment. Later, she met Ashley and expressed her love for him, wanting to marry him. But by this time, Ashley had already decided to marry Melanie. Disappointed, Scarlett decided to marry Charles, partly because he was Melanie's brother, so she could directly take revenge on Melanie, and partly because Melanie's cousin, Honey, was also in love with Charles, so marrying him would also disappoint Honey.</p>
<p>Scarlett married Charles in two weeks. Two months later, Scarlett became a widow, because after they got married, the Civil War immediately broke out, and many young men were drafted into the war. Charles and Ashley were naturally no exception, but Charles unfortunately died in battle, while Ashley was still fighting. Soon after, Scarlett gave birth to a son named Wade. She lived with Melanie at Twelve Oaks and gradually became very good sisters, because Melanie treated Scarlett even more warmly after Charles's death.</p>
<p>One day, at a dance to raise funds for the hospital, Scarlett met Rhett Butler. They had met when Ashley and Melanie were engaged, and Rhett had fallen in love with Scarlett at first sight, but he had never expressed it. Now, by chance, they met here, and he thought he would definitely be able to achieve his goal. Therefore, he immediately donated one hundred and fifty dollars in Scarlett's name to win her favor. Now, Rhett was very successful and relied on his courage to carry out commercial speculation in the blockade area, thus raising prices and making huge profits. Since he met Scarlett this time, he often came to see her and brought many gifts. He proposed to her several times, but Scarlett rejected him, because the only person she truly loved in the world was Ashley.</p>
