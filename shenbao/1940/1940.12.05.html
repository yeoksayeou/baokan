<p>社評</p>
<h3>美加緊援華與日美關係</h3>
<p>縱觀這半年以來的太平洋方面種種演進，雖有理由可以相信遠東方面的無政府狀態漸成過去；每一新的侵略企圖或步驟暴露於外，輒立即引起重大對抗行動，不再能夠像已往那樣爲所欲爲。有如日本與德義締結同盟，美英立即宣布對華貸款和對日禁運，以及緬甸公路的重開；此决阿部在南京簽訂了文件，美國又復通過一萬萬元的貸華巨欵，同時還紛傳英蘇亦將繼而貸欵中國。此等情形，一方證明了中國之得道多助，另一方面，則適足暴露日本的估量錯誤與顧此失彼，因而招致重大的挫逆。</p>
<p>幾年來日本的外交政策，一向最着重於對美關係，且曾以此爲內閣生命所寄託：日當局深知其擴展企圖最爲美方所反封，而美國的無比經濟偉力又爲日本命脈所依託；杲以歷年對美竭盡卑辭厚禮的能事，無非希冀减輕美方壓力，並阻撓美國的援華，俾遂其獨占遠東的大慾。在美國方面，原無對日武裝衝突的用心與準備：更有一部分人復斤斤於美日間的商業利益，不願兩國關係過涉僵持；是以白宮當局縱對於遠東問題具有明確認識與偉大抱貢，而已往在運用上則始終未能趨於十分積極。因之日本之於美國·雖屢遭碰壁，亦並不完全放棄其緩和對美關係之夢想。他們並不暸解那時的美國是因爲多少還冀其覺悟，因此不願過爲已甚；那知日方誤以爲可欺以其方，於是任意損害美方權益之不足，更肆其所謂新秩序之在想：乃値歐戰突變，法國敗北，日當局復誤信大英帝國傾圯在即，乃深與德義深相結納以期嚇退美國，遂行世界之冉分割。繼復以恫嚇與親善姿態交相爲用，以期於避免美方重壓之下，完成其侵華與南進的企圖。然而近頃的國際情勢已絕非蓄意欺騙者所能奏效，即如美國此度貸華巨款之適與在阿文件同時成立，足見美方早在保持警覺及準備對策，並未爲日方外交攻勢所蒙蔽或延宕。已往中國之厚望於美方而未獲者，於茲乃以日方在妄行徑而促其實現。這是日本對美外交的重大打擊，也是近衛政策的致命失敗，但却又都是日本所自召。</p>
<p>此次美國的對華貸款，已屬中日戰事爆發後的第四决；前此一九三八年十二月的二千五百萬桐油借款與本年三月間的二千萬錫鑛借款，雖同屬美國對華支援和友誼的表現，但尚未脫商業借款性質，用途方面亦有所限制。及至九月間爲了對抗三國同盟而成立的二千五百萬借款，則屬直接貸予中國政府，且不復限制用途、已漸進於政治借款的範圍。至於最近成立的一萬萬美金借欵，其數額之巨，已超過前此三度借款的總和，其政治性質與意義亦更明顯；此外並進而考慮以軍用飛機及其他軍用品供給中國。此一賢明措置，當益使中國抗戰之勇氣與堅定爲之提高，其所加於中國的精神上的影響，亦與其實際效果同樣彌可珍視。深信此太平洋東西兩岸的二大民主國家，此後當愈益親密携手比肩作戰，以求彼此共同信念與目標的貫澈。至於蘇聯和英國，無論所傳貸款消息是吾實現，在遠東現行情勢下，料其必能採取與美政府類似以至平行的措置。如果此一合作關係能繼續擴大與深人，則杌隉的遠東局勢，此後當不難漸趨安定。</p>
<p>連日日方與論，又已紛起咆哮，對美大事抨擊；日方此一姿態前此已一再見於九月間美國之貸款與禁運以及十一月初旬羅斯福的三度當選。然而那些輿論都亚未發生實際效果，日政府所採取的政策不只不趨強硬，反而以緩和步驟爲應付，目前日本處境既未因其在妄行徑而獲得進步，則此度對美政策之運用，亦必不能超過其實力所能允許的範圍以外。現在野村大使尚未赴美就任，代表極端派的國民新聞已斷言其並不能改進美日間的事件；但是除却訴諸一戰而外，究竟有何方策可資應付，日當局於此殆將至感焦慮，說不定也許會因此危及近衛內閣的前途。然而今日的日本，保守勢力在短時間內尚無恢復原有聲勢可能，極端分子的大言不慚又絕無何等實際把握；因此在這一新的形勢之下日本究竟要往何處去，還是一個待決的問題。</p>

<h3>重慶米價飛漲　舉行平糶</h3>
<p>重慶　邇來渝市米價、幾已上漲一倍、計八月間每斗售價三十元、（按渝市所用之斗較大、與上海所通用者不同）、目下則已增至五十二元、政府機關雖出售碎米、以救濟平民、惟數量極少、市民向各平糶體購米者、頗爲擁擠、依目前情勢而論、常人每月所費於米粉者、爲數不貲因此一般薪水階級下級公務員及普通工人之生活狀况、不免深感拮据、政府當局爲謀救濟起見擬按月採辦米糧、以資調劑、全國糧食管理局已定於十二月一日起、爲一般平民士兵家屬學生與公務員等，舉辦平糶、每擔售價六十元、每日以一千擔爲限、惟查全市每月的需米二十五萬擔、因此該局每日平糶一千　之數、自嫌不妙分配今　須當酌量增加、此外、當局亚採取各項步驟、以便利糧商自附近各區購米運渝銷售、而現行請領運米許可證辦法、亦當隨之取消、自不待言、更就一般情形觀之、渝市物價高漲、不僅米糧爲然、其他日用品莫不皆然、一般經濟專家對於此種漲風、議論紛紛、莫衷一是、有歸咎於運輸不良者、亦有歸咎於通貨膨脹成奸商囤積者、但重慶之國外滙市、及重慶上海間之滙率、近來旣較前益見堅定、可見所謂通貨膨脹、促成物價上漲一說、顯已不能成立、倘就最近漲價情形作客觀的分析、似其眞正原因、實以市庫存貨缺乏所致、例如四川省米糧原有適量供給、今者大部份業已供給軍用、或爲各銀行各商人所囤積、自感供不應求、允可惡者、被囤積者利慾薰心、往往有博得三四倍之厚利、而尚不能　望者、是以米價之上漲無已此輩實應　其咎也云、（四日哈瓦斯航訊）</p>

<p>歐戰痛史（四）</p>
<h3>達拉第萊諾　桃色誤國的內幕</h3>
<p>這篇是法國史家莫樂Andre　Maurois所作「法蘭西的悲劇」新著中另一章，茲迻譯如下：</p>
<p>從來黨同伐異，當局傾軋，足以影響戰事，妨害國政，在歷史上已數見不鮮。一九一八年，法國幸而領導得人，魄力雄偉，鎭壓住了一班搗亂份子。這人卽號稱「老虎總理的克來孟梭。一九三九年的法國則不然，當權用事的達拉第和萊諾，雖則忠心耿耿，却是互相水火，在戰爭期內，始終植黨爭權，衝突不已，法國遭遇不幸，他們兩人的不解之仇，也是一大原因。</p>
<p>英王喬治六世，在西大敎堂加冕的那一天，我也參加典禮，萊諾進來時，和我並坐的一位英國軍官忽然問我道，「這位身材矮小日本人面孔的是誰？」</p>
<p>我答道，「你休看他生得矮小，他是未來的法國總理呢。」</p>
<p>萊諾夫人琪央亨利洛勃脫是著名律師的愛女，她和我的內人是手帕交，因此淵源，我對於萊諾的一生事業，便特別注意。他爲人聰明勇敢，在政治家中不可多得，英鎊跌落時期，敢於主張法郞貶値的，祗有萊諾一人，後來爲勢所迫，法郞貶値到底無可避免。特戈爾上校曾主張軍隊機械化，並編練强有力的裝甲師團，在法國袞袞諸公，能加以注意硏究的，也祗有萊諾一人。法國對於靑年一味放任，聽其自然，萊諾却寫了一本小册，題曰「靑年們所期望的法國，」大聲疾呼，以警醒國人。</p>
<p>開戰之前，法國財政遭逢危機，萊諾出任財長，就職不過數星期，國庫中便增加了億兆法郞的金貨。他偶或心有所觸，突然一躍而起，兩手插在衣袋，挺胸昻首，發出槌擊一般的聲音，語語有力，最足使我神往。我們常戲稱他爲「小鬥鷄，」希望他能爲正義而奮鬥。</p>
<p>可是他人雖聰明，却爭强好勝，祗因自信太過，態度不免傲慢，持論雖極光明，言語水免深刻，和門外漢談到財政經濟問題，更有一種唯我獨尊之槪，當然要引起一班政治家的反感，達拉第允和他積不相能。</p>
<p>達拉第口才流利，不亞於萊諾，只是他說話的方式，不像萊諾那樣的揚揚得意，盛氣凌人。他熊度懇切，言語動人，似有滿懷愁緒。每逢達拉第當衆演說戰事，不論農工商賈，聽到他親切的語氣，莊重的聲調，和誠心誠意的愛好和平，都把達拉第當作法蘭西全國人民的導師了。</p>
<p>達拉第担任過歷史敎授，他原有一片赤誠，再經歷史薰陶，益增他爲國盡瘁的熱忱。可是他好處雖多，却被兩大過失抵消了。第一是性情褊急多疑，對同事們都懷猜忌；第二是意志不堅，有時竟然主張毫無。他忽而勃然大怒，以拳抵桌，雖是聲色俱厲，他的同僚們却說他不過是「空心拳頭，」又說他好像「鋼鐵手套中的一雙柔荑，」外强中乾。可是民衆祗看見他外貌奮發有爲，却不知道他的眞實性格，所以把「卡馬加小牛」的綽號贈他，希望他會有果敢驚人的行動。</p>
<p>一日，我問萊諾，「達拉第一朝去職，理想中的繼任人物是誰？」</p>
<p>他回答道，「在法國人的意中，還是達拉第。」</p>
<p>達拉第的輕躁易怒，猜忌性成，竟食和衆議院議長赫禮歐鬧翻。他兩人同屬急進社會黨，同名愛德華，却是形同冰炭，把急進黨攪得四分五裂。貝特所作喜劇中描寫一個角色，性情多疑，主見不定，甚至在結婚那天，還是猶豫躇躇，不敢到禮拜堂去做新郞。萊諾常說達拉第就是道種人物，他本來標榜急進，後來組織人民陣錢，爲保守性的中產階級所屬望，就因他的性質善變吧！達拉第也常反唇相譏說，「萊諾演說時，總是洋洋自得，神氣活現，使人難受，我想他好似一頭孔雀張着尾巴，在那裹高視闊步，自已賣弄。」</p>
<p>那時法國正在從事生死存亡之戰，他兩人身負國家重任，理應如何同心協力，共濟時艱。可是他們各逞意見，相持不下，又中了婦人枕　讒言之毒，自然要因怨生恨，因恨成仇了。</p>
<p>這事初看，似乎無足經重，與法蘭西的大悲劇，渺不相涉，何必多提。然而一方面因爲各種主要事實，舉世已經盡知，另一方面又因法國若干政治家的私生活，足以妨害公務，無可諱言，所以不能不表而出之。</p>
<p>若說一九三九年時，法國民族已經腐敗，未免大錯。無數良民，正度着他們簡單安寗的生活。不過在巴黎方面却有三千多人，與衆不同。他們正像詩人拜倫所說，「只因睡得　，便自以爲是世界上的領袖了。」他們縱請聲色，不以爲意，却不知道這些桃色的糾紛，寬會貽禍及於國家，所以要作一國領袖，必先能節制自己的情慾。</p>
<p>達拉第斷弦之後，卽與特克魯索爾侯爵夫人相繾綣。夫人恣容美麗，體態風流，雪膚花貌，一見傾城。她雖喜歡權勢，酷愛政治經濟，可是她身居幕後，並不想把她的愛人高抬天上，誇耀世人。因她謹守　範，於國家尚無大害。</p>
<p>萊諾的情婦寳爾蒂伯爵夫人却帶些風在刺激，好管閒事，實在是一個危險性的人物，但看後事便知。</p>
<p>有一天，我當着萊諾的面，批評達拉第一個舉措乖方的任命。</p>
<p>萊諾說，這事本不是達拉第的意思，而是「她」的意思」。</p>
<p>我說，「這是無可推託的」。</p>
<p>萊諾嘆了一口氣道，「你不知道整天忙碌的人，何等需要晚上的甜蜜啊」！</p>
<p>戰事一起，她—萊諾的情婦—便野心勃勃，不以萊諾做到財政部長爲滿足，她嬰不顧一切，把他抬上總理高位。她到處宣傳達拉　缺乏毅力，毫無建樹，逢人便說萊諾繼仟總理，已是急不容綏。這種蜚語，自會有人傳到達拉第耳中，他的痛恨萊諾，因此益深。這兩人同爲戰時內閣的閣員，有一時期，竟至面不相交談。這眞是一種荒謬絕倫的事，國家大局亦因此不堪設想了。</p>
<p>三月十九日，達拉第內閣搖搖欲倒。芬蘭戰事的失敗，使議院中羣情憤激，指摘達拉第不能及時援助。這種批評或不公允，因爲要編成遠征軍，派往芬蘭，眞是談何容易，就是派去了，也許會一敗塗地的</p>
<p>但是議員們却不管這些，他們要求召開一次秘密會議，討論整個下午，還沒有結果，就在當夜十點鐘檔續會議。</p>
<p>萊諾在晚上八點鐘到我家裏一同進餐。對我們說，「那個倒霉的達拉第，今天可够受用了。假使他今晚倒閣，我一點也不以爲奇」。</p>
<p>我的內人接口問道，「繼任總理是誰呢」？</p>
<p>萊諾答道，「那要看總統的意思，也要看打倒達拉第的因素而定」。（未完）</p>

<h3>男子婚後腎虧的原因合療法</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士姚崇培　性病專科醫師詹念曾　合著</p>
<p>（診所）北京路四川路口中國信託公司二樓　（時間）上午十時至下午六時星期日休息</p>
<p>腎虧是夫婦間愛情的蟊賊，壽命縮短使者</p>
<p>婚後男子一有腎虧症，夫婦間的愛情沒有不大受其影響，因爲夫婦是性關係的結合，一個精力豐沛的男子娶了一個健美多姿的女郞，沒有不度其甜蜜的生活的。因此夫婦愛情濃厚，生育着伶俐而健壯的子女，組織着美滿而快樂的家庭，道是多麼的幸福呀！要是男子有了腎虧，精力渙散的病症，那夫婦生活就無從圓滿，他們的愛情沒有不大受打擊的，我們在近來的報章雜誌中，或是茶餘酒後的談話間，時常的可以聽到看到關於夫婦糾紛或法院離婚的案件中，因爲丈夫的不能人道，妻子蹉跎靑春，不堪犧牲說得振振有詞的事實，此外丈夫腎虧症的放任不治，致身體日漸衰弱，一病嗚呼！遺下孤兒寡妻於不顧者，據某醫師所作靑年丈夫死亡統計與硏究中，亦有大可駭人的數字！所以婚後男子的腎虧一症，實爲當今醫家大可注意一的個嚴重問題。</p>
<p>爲何男子婚後多腎虧症？其原因大都爲男子於春情發動期多自凟遺精，或婚後的荒淫縱慾之故，至於用腦過度或工作斵傷，先天衰弱或病後失調等原因亦間或有之。此症在輕微時，在外表上每無甚異狀，繼之常與神經衰弱，新陳代謝機能减退諸種症象相伴而來，因此。時覺頭腦脹痛，健忘失眠，耳鳴眼花，腰酸背痛，滑精漏精，早洩陽萎，面黃肌瘦，怕寒畏熱，精神萎靡等症象卽相繼而來，終日困頓在憂鬱與疲憊之中，生活之痛苦，殊難以言喩！</p>
<p>關於此症的最對症而特效的療法，據世界名醫及余多年經騐，均一致推頌生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」，因此劑係根據事實需要，由無數的世界醫業專家，竭其畢生經騐，相互研究實騐，始由雄壯動物如猿猴猩猩等體中提取生殖腺素製成藥劑，結果始獲却病延年，返老還童之效，以是震驚於現代的世界醫壇，對於此劑發明最具功績者，爲歐洲生理學大家斯丹那博士，所以此劑卽以「斯丹那氏生殖素」名之。誠以此藥品質純粹，藥性王道，補力積極，服後於一日夜間卽能生精補腎，健腦活血，滋養神經，促進新陳代謝機能，而絕無刺激陽胃，興奮神經等副作用，若繼續服用，必可於短期內將上述各症完全治愈，幷可延年益壽，惟有遺精者，須兼服「希米脫氏固精片」，以固精關，制止遺洩，則收效允速，若患者能親來本診所就專家醫師診斷後，施用電療，注射，手術等科學療法，更可保證治愈。</p>
<h3>遺精失治的悲哀與挽救</h3>
<p>— 性病專科醫師詹念曾</p>
<p>每個男子。在靑春時期最易犯的弊病，無疑地是手淫，手淫這樣毛病，說起來雖很簡單而可鄙。但靑年一經沾玩以後。極易忽變成習慣。習慣旣成，於是正似吸煙上了癮，雖知共害而終不能澈底戒除。因其不能澈底戒除，由是靑春腺首受摧殘，精關鬆弛，繼起的便是遺精。</p>
<p>遺精從健康上講，牠是危害腦，性，脊髓三大神經最厲害的，所以靑年一旦患有此種惡症以後，思考力便急遽衰退。同時記憶不良。腰痠背痛，耳鳴心悸，夜眠盜汗等症叢生，而允其覺得可怕者，發靑機能大受打擊，性器的短小一如童稚，更有因精關開闔過頻，精囊括約筋鬆弛而突發滑精，漏精，因而引起陽萎早洩等症者，此種靑年，不特對於自身的健康與偉大的前途，均得遭遇劇烈的打擊，即於夫歸間的兩性生活上，亦每因不能盡責應付而爲妻所憎恨！於是內疚於心，外制於妻，羞愧惱恨！其痛苦殆非筆墨言語所能形容也！</p>
<p>關於本症的挽救方法，第一患者須淸心寡慾，週免不良的接觸，勤運動，戒絕惡癖，每晚臨睡前以冷水摩擦局部，注意排尿，並服『希米脫氏固精片』四片以固精關，則遺精自可於當晚立止，如因遺洩過頻而有上述各種衰弱症象者，則應同時兼服生殖腺素製劑「生殖素』，因該劑係提取獅，虎，猩猩，海狗等之生殖腺素，更和以珍貴的礦植物質，經過科學的方法，監製而成，故服後一日夜問，即能生精補腎，健腦益髓，如能繼續服用，持之以恒。則雖極虧弱的身體，與極兇惡的遺精，滑精，均能在短期內，澈底治愈。</p>
<p>健美</p>
<h3>乳峯如何能臻健美</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士姚崇培</p>
<p>健美的乳峯是時代　婦女必要的條件</p>
<p>在女性的胸前，有着一雙高聳的乳峯，的確有助於女性健美的增進，生育子女的把握以及哺育子女的便利。那末，提倡乳峯發達，實有無上的價値，時代的輪子是前進的，女性乳峯的發達，這是時代前進的例證，我們應一致的贊伺而幷努力以輔助她們的成功！可是積重難返，我們所見的女性，大都是乳癟顏瘦，呈未老先衰狀態，因此，略有些新智識的婦女，如何使乳峯健美？的確已成了一個普遍而重要的問題。哦們在醫學上的論斷，乳峯的特別發達，爲女性生理上的特徵，這種生理上特徵的發達，是根據於婦女的卵巢機能。如果卵巢機能健全，那不特乳峯會自然的聳起來，就是臀部亦必發達，聲調亦呈姊囀而優美，性情亦呈溫和而多情，伺時新陳代謝作用亦必旺盛，在皮膚，肌肉，血液等部分，均充滿着新生細胞，因此皮膚白嫩，肌肉鹽腴，血液充盈而鮮紅在面部就泛起了桃花，無須脂粉，已美麗非常，年齡雖增，可長駐靑春，夫婦生活，必甜蜜非常，生靑着伶俐而健壯的子女，組織着快樂而美滿的家庭，這是多麼幸福的女性呀！可是因過去束胸，或有白帶，不感，月經不調等隱疾的婦女，卵巢機能必受其摧殘，遂致乳癟而顏衰，生育無望，夫婦愛情淡薄，她的命運必悲慘之至！唯一補救辦法，即服卵巢製劑女用『生殖素』，以培補卵巢機能，旺盛新陳代謝作用，則乳峯於旬日內卽可聳起，上述隱疾可一旦肅淸，誠爲相進健美却除疾病的唯一婦科良藥也。</p>

<h3>糧食　投機米商如願以償　崑山粳一百零六元　洋米到源又是一萬多包　昨日售價午後已見回小</h3>
<p>米市自經連朝暴漲後、米業公會通告自卽日起、所有市塲費買、務須依照三日上午市價、不得超越、如有故違私作暗盤、一經查確卽報告當局從嚴懲罰後、昨米市直延至近午方開、一般投機大戶、尚在觀望、不思脫手、僅浮囤散戶、爲因銀根關係、無力堅守者、稍事出籠、然對方買戶當斯環境、納　已淡、銷塲旣淸、賣方遂不得不貶價相邀、並因新交易續有正式公布、且有直接訂購、因此一般投機浮多至楚亦心虛求脫、故中市回疲、午市立小二三元、午後賣氣愈旺、而華洋商紛紛打電接洽、浮戶以獲利斬多、市乃再小一元外、結果現貨小二三元、期貨小三四元、新交易除泰和洋行之小絞一千五百噸一月份價七十八元外、其他未有公布、回籠貨計有開出一號西貢現貨一百〇五元、十二月九十六元半至九十五兀、二號九十六元至九十五元半、小絞八十六七元、且執貨者競相求售、故回籠交易又加至一千多噸、現貨實銷既呆、囤胃觀望、成交祗五六千包、</p>
<p>厚薄粳國米、自經界外來　告斷、所有市貨逐日居奇扳俏、前日上午斛見開九十八元、午後又傳說竟有驚人之高價開出、原包崑粳穿越百元大關、達百零四元後、昨則續在此種狀態中、繼升二元譜、聞原包崑粳開百零六元半之最高峰、斛見亦須一百元、特別原包薄稱一百零二元至一百元斛見九十七八元、杜洋尖依然無市、今年新正所謂百元一石之米價投機米商靠外力、如願以償、且又過之、</p>
<p>糯米因洋糯遭洋米牽制、致國糯去路並見轉遜、不過售價尚因貨主以籌碼有限、不肯鬆脫、未起變化、計開宜溧貨仍爲九十五元、香港白元八十六元至八十四元、糯　七十五元至七十二元半、</p>
<p>洋米接踵到滬、咋日怡和洋行阜生輪、　香港裝來千零十六包、太古公。濟南輪亦自香港裝來九千九百九十二包、兩輪同於昨晨抵埠、分泊於羅斯福碼頭及法租界外灘該行碼頭起卸洋米不斷而來、米價連續猛漲、平民生計堪虞、不知何　得平也、（祖）</p>
<h3>洋粉步漲不已</h3>
<p>麵粉　日昨洋粉市况、因本粉缺乏、需要者莫不注意於洋粉、更有客幫轉口交易、其銷塲愈覺普遍、統市做開鐘樓花鳥脾等澳州洋粉一萬包以上、現貨售價二十允零二角至二十元、路貨亦抵二十元大關、漲勢亦可謂神速矣、惟聞米價已告回跌、人心漸臻平穩、叉聞本月十日左右、卽有洋粉一船可到、額計二十餘萬包、屆時市面或可抑平也、至華廠粉批出仍爲八千包强、廠盤仍爲十八元、</p>
<p>小麥　昨日交易仍無特殊開展、租界棧存麥價須二十九元、華廠暫無接受，惟外傳三鑫廠又收進期貨三萬餘包、價扯二十八元、均係十二月下期交貨、陸續交解、至門市收進者、爲數不過二三百包、</p>
<h3>證劵　外債漲風　日見騰高　內債亦向上進</h3>
<p>倫敦三日（週二）電、今日中國外債及遠東英商各公司股票掛牌行市、中國外價、市氣堅强、各債概漲一鎊、前檔之英德　借款（英發）爲三十八鎊半、中法美金爲四十一鎊至四十六鎊、英法借款（英發）爲四十三鎊、克利斯浦爲二十鎊、善後借款（英發）爲三十一鎊、費克斯飛機借款爲十鎊、後檔鐵路債券、北寗爲四十七鎊、道　為十六鎊、湖廣（非德發）與京滬、爲十五鎊、隴海爲十四鎊、湖廣（德發）與津浦原續發、各爲十三鎊廣九為十二鎊、速東股票、銀行股稍有上落、麥加　銀行股漲二先令六便士、價爲七鎊七先令六便士、滙豐銀行英倫註冊股升一鎊、價爲七十鎊、父香港註冊股跌落三鎊、價爲七十鎊、有行無市、其餘不動，</p>
<p>證券暗盤、昨日市况漸有　機、多空相持多日、仍爲多方佔優勞，環境上漸起顯者變化、美國　借款之後、又有其他友邦鉅額貸款、雖尚在傳說時期、實現當亦不遠、維持法幣、漸覺有力、幷聞政府對於商業滙兌率、有相當放長之擬議、公債因此又到抬頭時期、投資漸多，市價日高、前途當有新發展也，昨日上午、十六號首先買淮丙種、抬高三四角，鴻大淮胃亦極强、餘如怡泰同　同康聯和聯益亦有相當抵補或新做、萎靡不振之市價、乃稍有生氣、午後消息大盛、均鳥利多、鴻大他續買進、順昌同順長康皆有需要、聯益聯和稍有供出、丙伯曾達四元、怡泰復出、德昌潤利亦有結賣、回小一二角、而協康生大牲昶及六十四號又來搜羅丙　、復又回上、形勢堅俏、市塲購買力極為雄厚、結果一致回漲二三角至七角辦、成交總數的計二百萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交仁元地產公司股二百股、價為二十六元半、</p>
<p>衆業公所股市、開盤仍軟、不久恢復穩勢、多空雙方俱鮮大量進出、會德豐一度會低至八十二元半、收盤回至八十四兀成交、茲有理由相信、明日開認之上海毛絨公司新股、認股者必將大量逾額、此點或足使未來一般市况同蒙改進、橡皮股靜穩、</p>
<p>金融　外匯賣戶踵相接　重慶商業匯率有放長說　一般以為此時不致實現</p>
<p>外匯昨日市況、滙豐掛牌、悉無上落、英美　暗市、仍　鬆途、賣風銜接、尤以港電吐寨爲力、中途又傳重慶商業滙率、對英改懸六便士、對美改爲十元、較前放長之說、惟一般僉以爲不致實現、蓋如果實現、則正如日本外務省發言人須磨所謂、「美國此項借款，或可使日本在華之商業，獲得間接之利益、」故對於上海滙市、政府若無强有力之管理辦法、責外滙如果予以維持、冉行放長、非中國之福、故至大之限度、提高自由中國區域內外匯水準、或許有此說、但亦一時如無準備而卽實現、難免不影響於滬市、惟法幣前途終屬樂觀、故外滙終有放長之一日但處於目前環境下、爲尚非其時耳、前日重慶電訊、有某强國予中國以經濟援助、貸款牧買鵭錫之信、昨日市塲上遂有英國借款之說、並有蘇聯對華貸款之說、於是昨日匯市人心激動、投機商羣相出賣、最硬美滙做開價六元、成交不少、至午收價、英金三便士七八一二五、美匯五兀九六八七五、午後週三無市、比上日英美各硬〇一五六二五與〇三一二五、期貨均與現貨軋乎、</p>
<h3>投機港幫均售</h3>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條、近期平遠期回升〇六二五、紐的銀價平定、倫敦生金呆定、匯兌英對美勿動、對滬長〇三一二五、美對英未史對滬平、對法無市、中央掛牌各匯如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金三便士七六五六二五、美匯五元九三七五、與上日晚收價一樣、開盤日行正金曾先吃入外銀行本月份美匯五元九三七五、未幾　電來塞、正金復吐同月美滙、計由有利及某美商銀行進五元九三七五、以至九六八七五、匯豐掛牌褐曉、一致無上落、白銀平衡稅揭曉亦平、此後一度因費戶中止、而徵回軟、但不久華銀行對做現貨先令、賤爲三便士七九六八七五、而斯時投機家力售、港電續出、價破硬化、美匯達六元關、計美銀行暨外行吸人彼輩、本月份美滙六元、午收價尚穩、計現貨近遠期英金均告三便士七八一二五、美滙五元九六八七五、比上日現貨近期英長〇一五六二五、美硬〇三一二五、下月份英美各鬆〇三一二五及〇六二五、</p>
<h3>香港英平美鬆</h3>

<h3>天津匯價同長</h3>
<p>天津四日（週三）電、今晨海市開盤先告鬆倫敦電匯硬一八七五、爲四便士一八七五，紐的電滙長二五、爲六元五三一二五、申滙降二元五角，爲八十九元五角、「聯鈔」暗盤賤二元二角五分、爲八十九元、</p>
<h3>一片翻空聲中　金價慘落</h3>
<p>昨日金中烚赤暗市、跌勢益銳、價已　入五千八百元大　內、乃聞重慶商業　　掛牌將放長志傳說、且滬西某　頭公司來出籠、人心大見虛疲、開始卽低微五千七百八十元、在金號等賣風續　三十元、此後曾起意外漲勢，銀號錢莊傾向補空約二千兩、遂見飛出至五千八百二十元、不久利空傳說忽起、外滙鬆勢忽動、且岷號幫代匯票商與多頭公司來儲賣、遂見在退至五千七百二十五元、終爲五千七百三十允、軋小八十五元、收後又退至五千七百二十元無買戶、半日交易共五千數百兩、下午週三無市，現金比期交價低十元、金號銀號出錢莊數十兩、掉期兩銀號互做六十兩、買方貼出予賣方十二元、飾金掛小十元、至五百九十元，關金等均平、</p>
<h3>烚赤跌八十三元</h3>
<p>晨初已極不振、買氣銷沉，金號先售予銀號二十兩、五千七百八十元、作開盤價、比上日做低三十餘元、而金銀號等聯袂吐塞、再降三十元、計銀號對做三十兩、五千七百五十元、此時外滙　長、走勢尚緩、散胡見賤、紛紛撈進、致見回高、計證券幫進銀號二十兩、五千八百元、霎時內金號欲售、又撳二十元、計余號出錢兌業三十兩、五千七百八十元、嗣賴銀號錢兌業突然搜購、挺出八百元關外、計證券幫入金號二十兩、漲至五千八百二十元、不意好景不常、反起盛大賣風、乃外滙報鬆、美匯到六元、金銀號等莫不吐出、慘落至五千七百二十五元、計金　出銀號一十兩是也、結果銀號對做三十兩、五千七，百三十元、午後週三無市、比隔昨跌八十三元、半日商落九十元、現金號之木牌金售價、較拾赤高十餘元、收進低三十元、現標金照掛牌金低五六十元、均鮮做開、</p>
<h3>飾金亦掛小十元</h3>
<p>銀樓師金每兩兌出價低十元、計大同行改觀五百九十元、新同行與上價相仿、收進低三十元云、</p>
<p>明年銀行休假日期</p>
<p>上海市銀行業同業公會會員銀行、民國三十年休假日期表、業已訂定、茲抄錄於後、</p>
<p>外幣供求不勻</p>
<p>昨日外幣市况、烚赤市價、起落不定，終見續跌、英美金鎊因亦各跌一元、英金票供求均勻、市價站平、美金票起落不定、始則退至十六元七角二分、繼而步漲至八角叫分、旋又退爲五角七分卒爲十六元六角二分、比上日終低一角八分，香港票則因需要不稀、市價略漲、日金票漲後回落、晚市爲一元五角三分、朝鮮票需要仍殷、晚市高至一元二角一分、</p>
<h3>紗花　金矛幫大量出籠　紗價急轉直下</h3>
<p>紗市又入迴旋之境、但實際交易尚稱不惡、香港幫對於卅二支單紗納胃奇健、故卅二支犬女獨漲三十元外、所以同業人心振作、惟一般金子幫時抱投機觀念、因金子價昂、將紗則斤、如果反之則出一時五十分外、塲內謠風皺起、謂消　利空、金子幫一致拋賣、一霎間忽落十元外、旋後稍形回昻、惟同業依然購進也、今日有紗二千五百十件運香港、</p>
<p>雙馬晨開氣勢和養、首盤價爲一千二百二十八元、塲內尚稱平靜、價跌至一千二百二十五元、旋聞香港幫對於現紗需求繼續良好、三二支　馬大女售價跳起二三十元之譜、同時外匯長後稍縮、於是買氣瀰漫、一般空頭搶進抵補市盤越開越緊、直漲至一千二百四十三元、但有一部獲利多頭吐出、情况又平、回下時近十一時半、以後謠言突乎其來、外滙將放長、一刻間金子幫亦來大量出籠、形勢急變、直落至一千二白二十五六元、但某大紗號等依然吸進，收盤回上爲一千一百二十九元、查半日間成交統計五千四百五十包、行情二十支雙馬跌十元、茲將各幫口冒去之額量、分列如左、</p>
<p>同行　四、六〇〇　香港五七〇天津二七〇　寗波　一〇統計五、四五〇</p>
<h3>棉花廠胃稍活</h3>
<p>現棉情况、較爲起色、因各方來源不爽、且手續麻煩極甚、風險允大，所以存貨日趨减弱矣、同行中對於米特林棉搜羅殷切也、故棉市基礎、日見鞏固矣、</p>
<p>另訊外棉市價、紐的棉市、晨初卽呈堅定狀態、先因投機者之購買、續後則父因政府報告、美國內紗廠用棉數量之增加、同時同業購買亦極踴躍、結果收盤較之上日漲六七磅音、印度停市、預測漲一羅比餘、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、廠方較形活躍、頗有購意、但限於現貨者，　數亦屬有限、以二十支原料爲大宗、日方廠力亦略見採辦、</p>
<h3>疋頭　棉布達市見疲</h3>
<p>廠布　昨市微落、有盤旋之勢、蓋外傳中蘇新貸款又將成立、外匯放長、原紗趨跌、布價受挫、白貨粗細布斜紋大部穩定、小額跌一角至二角牛、漂染布互有參差，重漿及下檔淸水漂布絲光士林布價最堅、乃因市上需要較殷之故、本街成交、坯布漂染布絨布等七百餘件、粤港幫辦色布漂布粗細布府綢三百餘件、浙閩幫亦辦一百餘件、北路烟台幫辦粗布色布等一百數十件、</p>
<p>東布　因東紗續降、市盤略軟、龍頭細布跌落每疋一二角、收盤價三十五元五角、中檔細布、因本街需要殷切、仍頗堅俏、提升一二角、四君干嗶嘰晨開一元〇九分二五、後市回至一元〇八分六二五、</p>
<p>出口　咋日有疋頭三千二百九十件、運往香港、又二十九件、運往新加坡、</p>
<h3>雜糧　囤戶出籠　油豆漲勢稍殺</h3>
<p>昨日雜糧市况因金跌匯鬆先日謠傳種種、均非事實、兼受米價陡落、投機米蠧尤感華頭喪氣、致漲風　戢、嚴開後業內外囤戶大都止進爲出、盲從散戶亦多束手觀望、故市勢逐漸轉平、結果生荳油現貨回低半元左右、期貨見降兀半、黃豆亦帶平疲之象、統市售開大有廠豆油三百担、烟歧豆　三十件、膠州豆油五十件、膠州生油三百件、父新貨一百件、烟台生油五十件、靑島生油四十五桶、又十二月下期一千二百桶、又二月期四白五十桶、天津金元一百八十包、靑烏黃豆一百包、</p>
<h3>煤炭　二批鴻基煤　共到九千噸</h3>
<p>鴻基白煤、自月前七千噸抵達以來、日昨第二批定貨、亦已裝到、由法商航務公司「阿卡脫」輪戰來、計塊煤三千噸、煤屑六千噸，在外灘碼頭排車、由義泰興南洋兩行經理代售、除一部份以解老棧單、大多數可供給同業行拆及客戶零售云、</p>
<h3>糖市　糖價回鬆</h3>
<p>咋糖市以外匯復長、趨勢回軟、公會劃盤現貨二四粗白外棧七十二元七角、小三角、荷棉白K嘜七十二元、荷赤現貨五十六元三角、小四角、本月十日打單五十六元七角、小三角、太古車白B嘜四棧七十五元六角、小五角、DY西棧六十九元三角、東棧六十九元二角、後稍緊爲六十九元半、HX嘜四棧六十九元、東棧同價，後升至六十九元二角牛、比前日尚跌五角至九角許、三日香港來糖五千四百包、四日又來四百六十八包、</p>
<h3>南北貨　興化圓猛跌</h3>
<p>興化桂圓自首批到過數十擔後，因原頭不易運出、以致中斷多時、至近日始有續到一批、但雜路貨源源有到、市價已降去不少、故興圓亦難例外、昨開出一批、降度竟達百分之四十強、幾與首市相差一半云、</p>

<h3>滬西界外警　竟成立最後協定　一俟經過所謂『核准』手續　『市警』卽入局方管轄區域</h3>
<p>據工部局情報處公告、關於滬西界外馬路區域之警權問題、由於警務處長與盧英會談之結果、已成立協定、此項協定、尚須經工部局董事會與「上海特別市政府」之核准、不久可望山「市政府」正式送達工部局、</p>
<p>內容透露　人數增多</p>
<p>關於滬西越界築路區「聯合問題、昨日已由警務處總巡包文少校及市警局長盧英成立最後協定、據包氏昨對新聞記者稱、此項協定、係一手繕之文件、已提交工部局、呈請核准、又稱、以前對協定中各要點、均係包文氏與盧英當面交涉、但協定之成立、則係公文之交換、協定內容、雖未發表、但據權威方面消息、聯合警權之人數、將較以前工部局與傳筱庵所規定者爲多、並悉聯合警權」之首領、將由「市府」委任、其副首領則由工部局委任、以此二人作爲雙方之聯絡員、此决最後協定之成立、業經雙方警務當局數月之談判、臨時協定、則係一年前所簽訂、當時「市警一卽移入越界築路區域、該區以前本在公共租界警務處管轄之內、</p>
<p>原擬條款　頗多變更</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、工部局發言人今（四日）晨正式披露、公共租界與「市」方警務首腦、對於滬西界外馬路區聯警隊成立事、已於今日商獲最後協定、其全文不久將交「市府」核准、協定詳則、今晨未能官布、惟聞工部局警務處長包文與「市警局長」盧英對於西區聯警隊成立事、經兩閱月之討論後、已滿意商妥協定、預料公共租界當局與傳筱庵締結草的中所訂定之條款有若干變動、大的係聯警隊成立後、界外馬路區所設警局總數、予以增加、此外、負責人士相信聯警隊長將由「市府」委華人仟之、而由公共租界當局委仟副隊長、在雙方間擔任聯絡工作、</p>
<h3>全國驛運綱　年內完成　恢復驛運制度</h3>

<h3>朱博泉　昨已脫險</h3>
<p>昨晨朱已安然返家</p>
<p>上海市票據交換所主席朱博泉、自于上月廿九日在億定盤路被架後、茲據消息靈通方面稱、朱業于昨晨安然返家、但脫險詳情、則未探悉、</p>
<p>非涉金錢　恐有背景</p>
<p>大陸報云、上海銀行家朱博泉被綁已多日、迄無下落、頃據朱氏友好聲稱、朱氏家屬、尚未接綁匪之通知、欲與綁匪獲取接觸亦未果、觀於綁匪久守緘默、恐此罪案有政治背景、而其動　非在勒索贖款云、按朱氏係赴辦公室時、途經億定盤路海格路口被綁、出事後、本市銀行界紛紛揣測此案、或係政治份子主謀、蓋若輩曾籍絡朱氏爲某方金融事業服務、遭其拒絕乃出以綁　手段、迫使朱氏附從也、租界警務當局仍以不知此綁案爲言、據稱、朱氏如果被綁、事必發生於租界區外、又聞朱氏車夫曾於出事後一度返海格路六百號朱寓、其後卽告失蹤、迄未探悉其蹤跡、</p>
<h3>大塲日機場　昨日忽大火　延燒數小時　燬飛機多架</h3>
<p>大塲日本飛機場、於咋日下午忽告大火、聞是役焚去飛機多架及戤司令多箱、損失殊鉅、延燒的二三小時、始行撲滅、事後蘇州河麥根路橋停泊之各船隻、均由日憲兵會同「市警」驅逐、不得逗留、聞與大塲機塲失愼有關、</p>
<h3>滬西封鎖經交涉後　局勢稍見和緩　准許輸入食物但須檢查　昨日挨戶搜索仍未停止</h3>
<p>日方在憶定盤路旁封鎖區實施嚴格限制、歷三天後、至昨（四日）晨情勢漸弛、惟封鎖區內、仍有日憲兵挨戶搜查、據警方披露、前夜外僑沿憶定盤路而行、遭日憲兵略施檢查、華人則准經過、未遇重大困難、僅携包裹者受檢、英文大美晚報記者昨晨以日方封銷、諒將維持多久一問、叩諸各官方人士、彼等皆未能斷言、</p>
<p>領團交涉　情勢漸鬆</p>
<p>惟據某領署官員聲稱、駐滬日總領事崛內與丹麥總領事兼領袖領事希爾商討封鎖事後、現正給予密切之合作，聞丹日兩領事討論時、和睦商妥日當局僅將在西區採取對付恐怖份子所必要之手段、並就可能範圍、儘速撤除封鎖食物物郵件及其他必需品、亦將准許送入封鎖區、但須受檢查、昨晨警方消息稱、衆信日憲兵現施搜查、旨在發現曲折里弄內之恐怖份子「巢穴」、惟日當局對於封鎖事、昨晨仍守緘默、亦不披露有無被捕之消息、</p>
<p>多數外僑　享領判權</p>
<p>字林報云、上星期六日、日憲兵一名在大西路遇刺、日當局卽在該「歹土」區實施限制、據昨日（三日）消息、上海領事團與日方進行折衝後此項限制、稍告寬放、外僑聞訊、頓覺寬心、此間領袖領事希爾昨日午後與日總領事崛內會談、交換雙方對於西區封鎖事之觀點、聞希兩　崛內時、代表領事團對日人遇刺、表示遺憾、惟稱、渠希望就可能範國、儘速撤除封鎖、而該區外僑因日力出此手段、諸多不便、希爾並請日方搜查外僑及其汽車、應儘可能審愼從事、因該區外僑、多數享有領判權，而不受他人搜查也、</p>
<p>百餘華人　已遭逮捕</p>
<p>此外、希爾又請日方准許醫　員學童與食物、出入封鎖區卽崛內答稱、日方並無　害該區外僑之意、但日方捨此別無他法可取、故日方將維持封鎖、至其認為不必搜查時為止查日方進行搜查　已歷三日、據可靠消息、在此三日內、日方已逮捕華人逾一百人、關於搜查外僑汽車事、崛內雖表歉意但謂不得不有此舉、因日方知刺客將其武器暗藏停留道旁之汽車藉以夾帶、而車中　車夫皆不知之、此卽日方搜查之原因、至於封鎖區內、華人糧食問題影響最甚、聞該區食米、已採購一空、蛋每枚售八角肉每磅三元、煤球每元僅卅枚</p>
<p>錢家巷曾　一度開放</p>
<p>據平明社記者訪悉、日方封鎖之範圍　東自地豐路至憶定盤路、南自大西路至愚園路、此一區域內之居　、均失自由、愚園路錢家巷、已被日方拆除之斷壁殘垣中、曾開放一缺口、惟至午後、又加封鎖、所允許出入者、僅婦女及幼童、並嚴禁攜物出外、</p>
<p>中西學童　已可進出</p>
<p>滬西憶定盤路工剖局華童公學大西路工部局小學等學校、亦屬封鎖綫內、惟合學生出人、已由日方在愚園路和平路口開啟一缺口、准許中外學童進出、多數西童上學及放學進出時、成羣結隊、由敎師領導、以防發生意外之事件、該處缺口、僅作學生進出之用、其餘西僑·日僑、及車輛出入、則限於大西路地豐路轉角一處、</p>
<p>糧食問題　最為嚴重</p>
<p>被困封鎖區內之居民、　嚴重者、殆爲食糧問題、各食物商店爲預防長期封鎖起見、均不願將食物出售、致居民無法獲得食品、昨日靜安寺路和平路有居民數百人鵠立於障碍物傍佇候素識之人、請求接濟糧食、據界內一婦人談、彼之丈夫在租界作工、上月三十日出事後、至今未能歸家、因之家內經濟、遽告匱乏、小兒啼飢號寒、痛苦不堪、</p>
<p>汪家弄房　屋將拆除</p>
<p>日軍曹佐木前在大西路在家弄口被狙擊殞命後、滬西愚園路大西路等均被擴大封鎖、迄今尚在繼續封鎖中、探悉該案發生地點在家弄、日方已於昨日派員前往丈量、並在在家弄口樹立紅旗、據悉日方已決定將該弄仿錢家巷辦法、將該弄民房拆去、拓寬成馬路、</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<p>人物</p>
<h3>「病」</h3>
<p>— 寗靜</p>
<p>現在，每聽說有年靑的朋友病了，我不禁要懷疑起牠的眞實性來；同時，往往的在眼前好像浮出了一幅像片似的。有一個有着畏頭髮，大而亮的眼睛，和帶黑色的皮膚的而影在閃動着；耳中也彷彿聽見他低而急的聲音，很有力的饗了。他的「病」的事自然地湧上我的心頭，也自然地加强了我的信念：「中國是有救的，她有着這樣的靑年。」</p>
<p>他就是績民，矮矮的身材，稍微有點兒胖，天眞而又熱情。有一决，他騎着的自由車，撞到了牆上，他於是像小孩子般的尖叫起來；我們笑了，他險紅了一紅，走了開去。不一會兕，叉聽見他高吭雄壯的歌聲了。在急於得到一個解答的時候，他會抓住了我的肩頭，輕輕的搖着，他的眼暖着我，很正經地，「你說呀？你說呀？一摧促着我。可是當他在不快活着或是沉思着，他又變得出奇的寗靜，像一個幽穆的詩人在苦思他的詩句一樣，就在他那圓圓的大眼中，也似乎帶有憂　的光彩。</p>
<p>兩年前，我們是同學，可是不久他就轉學了，我們的見面就漸漸稀少起來。他的家離開我的住址很遠，我去過一次；高大的鐵門，和他平時衣着的儉樸好像不大相稱，一撳鈴，就有狗叫起來，門上開了一個小洞，一隻眼在張望着，經過詢問之後，那看門的向裏面叫了：「喊一聲少爺，朋友來了。」於是他飛跑了出來，很熱情的招待我進去，不過我看了那種情形，不自主的覺得拘束起來了。這樣，因爲沒有什麼重要的事，後來我也就沒再到他那裏去。</p>
<p>在去年秋天的一個下午，我遇到了他的弟弟，背着書包，和幾個同學在一起走。我叫住了他，想從他的口裏得到一些他哥哥的消息，可是只聽到了一句：</p>
<p>「他嗎，病了兩三天了。」不等我再問，他就跑去追上他的同學了。於是我決定去望望他。</p>
<p>第二天黃昏前，我去了。又經過詢問之後，一個傭婦把我引到了他的房門前。推開房門，就看見他正張大了眼望着天花板在沉思，聽見門饗，回頭望了望，就熱烈地叫了：</p>
<p>「哈！是你嗎？怎麼會來的？」一面就坐了起來。</p>
<p>「來看你呀！」我回答了。「晤！睡着談，不要坐起來。」我望了他一眼，開始有些懷疑了，他的　依舊是那樣，而且因爲興奮的緣故，黑裏還透出些紅，眼睛露着光輝，頭髮雖也蓬着，可也看不出病了兩三天的痕跡。</p>
<p>他却微笑了，囑附我關上了門，於是像小孩子躱在柴房裏講故事似的，用一種謹愼而高興的聲調開始說了：</p>
<p>「你會奇怪吧，我是在裝病呢！」</p>
<p>「甚麼？」我有點不大相信我的耳朵。</p>
<p>他司不管我，繼續地向下說了，臉也變得很嚴肅。</p>
<p>「我就耍離開上海了，到後方去，我不願再在這裏挨下去！……」門開了，一個傭婦捧了杯茶進來，放在我旁邊，又向他說：</p>
<p>「太太叫你不要坐起來，常心受凉；話也少說些。」他隨便地答應了一聲，目送着傭婦出去，對我感嘆了：</p>
<p>「母親待我眞好！……」可是他又不讓他心上離別的悲傷擴大起來，就把話題轉了一個方向，「後天有好多朋友要走了，我已經決定一同去。前天我在爹媽前試探一下他們的意思，可是他們都不贊成，而且反嚴密地防備起我來。我只好裝病了，後天準要偷個空逃走。」</p>
<p>「兩天了，只吃些粥，肚子餓得眞難受。」他苦笑著。「其實他們用溫度計一量就知道了，但是他們卻請了一個中醫，那個糊塗交貨竟就開起方子來，哈哈！」天晚了，黑暗侵進了這間小室，房裏精美的傢具，都模糊地立着，好像很沉默地悲傷和牠小主人的離別。而他的聲音是低低的，沉着地在空氣中揮動着。</p>
<p>「寗！替我送封信好嗎？」他向我要求。</p>
<p>自始至終，我一聲不響的聽着他譯，我是完全被他感動得陶醉了。到這時候，才醒了過來；我點點頭，沒有響，心中千頭萬緒，複雜得很。我替他開了燈，拿了紙筆給他，他立刻把信寫了起來，封好，交給了我。</p>
<p>「給振之，那個戴眼鏡的瘦長子……你或許見週的吧，請你千萬要告訴振之，後天我一定來，要等候我一下。」於是我們緊緊地握了手，他的眼閃著閃的，彷彿有眼淚要流出來了。</p>
<p>「續民，再會了！以後寫信來吧！」這是我底最後一句話。</p>
<p>兩天後，我又到他家去，整個的家庭已經鬧得一團糟了，他的弟弟看見了我就立刻告訴我說他走了。一早，趁着看門的帶了狗出去，他偷偷地帶着一只小皮箱走了；房門仍舊掩着，他們還當他夜裏失眠，早晨要多睡一會兒呢。到九十點鐘才發覺，趕到碼頭，船已經開了。我沒等到聽完，就跑了回來；熱血沸騰了。</p>
<p>之後，每逢到有朋友病了，我不禁懊疑他們是生了和績民同樣的病症，我立刻就趕到他們的家裏，因爲這或許也會成爲我和他們的最後一次會面呢。</p>
<p>霍桑探案</p>
<h3>舞后的歸宿</h3>
<p>— 程小青著</p>
<p>第十二章　報告和解釋</p>
<p>我曾向他說道：「我們的國家在處在危急的時代，未來的禍雖，隨時可以發生，而且也沒法避免。靑年是國家的命脈，民族的柱石，你是個優秀的知識份子，怎麽自暴自棄，投進了迷人的魔窟裏去，幹這自殺的行爲？」霍桑的話，當然更婉轉些，不比我這樣率直。余甘棠顯着羞愧無地的樣子。我暗暗歡喜，料想這少年還有自新的可能，國家也可多留一分元氣。因爲一個人有了錯誤而能够感到羞愧，可見他的知恥心還沒有完全消滅。我所期望他的自新，就寄託在這一點上。</p>
<p>霍桑在和倪余壽作別的時候，對於報紙上的新聞字句，曾可囑過幾句。他果眞爲趙伯雄留些地步，不會把他的名字牽速進去，速余甘棠也祗寫余某字樣。就是我此刻記載，甘棠二字，也出於杜撰。還有幾個人的姓名，也是都曾變易過的。</p>
<p>這一夜我們回寓所時已交十一點鐘。第二日，李守琦到上海來，受過倪金壽的訊問，證實了霍桑所推測的李芝範的動機。不過他對於他父親行兇的計謀，決不知情。這件案子既然借宿，霍桑業不主張多所牽累。出來將郵匯的四千五百六十元追回以外，李守琦就完全沒有什麼處分。關於那舞后的財產，李守琦當然不敢耍求承繼。陸健笙却曾提出收回的請求。霍桑曾竭力反對，結果連同他送給霍桑的酬報，都捐給了慈善機關。</p>
<p>姜安娜曾來謝過霍桑。霍桑拒絕了伊的酬金，回答了幾句忠告。伊因着伊同伴的不幸的歸宿，也有相當的覺悟。那個乘黑汽車的雨衣客業始終沒有下落。還有麗蘭的好朋友鮑玉美，也不曾事件伊的諾言·伊到底不曾麗蘭家去。趙伯雄曾否找到伊，我們也沒有知道道。不過從這件案子披露以後，這位鮑玉美小姐，忽然離開舞塲，從此便銷聲匿跡地不知去向了。（一八六）（完）</p>

<h3>關於「傳人安迪生」</h3>
<p>— 新影</p>
<p>跟著「幼年安迪生」之後，「偉人安迪生」（Edison，the　Man）又將在大華公映了。茲將米高梅拍攝此片的經過，約略寫些在下面：</p>
<p>故事內容</p>
<p>「偉從安迪生」的電影脚本，根據陶爾斯卡萊與休哥勃脫萊兩氏所寫的故事，而和「幼年安迪生」所不同的，就是後者描寫安迪生幼年時的生活，前者是寫安迪生成年後種種的努力研究科學和發明各種物品，成功一個大發明家，為世人所尊崇的經過。</p>
<p>攝製經過</p>
<p>在本年度的製片計劃表上，米高梅早就確定把安迪生的歷史攝成兩部影片：一部是「幼年安迪生」，一部是「偉人安迪生」。所以年度開始，便同時開拍這兩部影片，攝製的時間雖不很久可是對於考據工作，相當完備，而且有好多鏡頭，是到安迪生的實騐室裏去拍攝的。</p>
<p>演員陣容</p>
<p>「幼年安迪生」的由米　羅納主演，正和一偉人「安迪生」的由史本賽屈塞主演一樣，是理想的角色，女角由海蒂拉摩充任。一個　超羣的男星，一個是著名的漂亮女星，他們合演這部「偉人安迪生」，自有超特的成績。此外的配角有麗泰約蓀，琳奧維門，却　斯柯朋，琴落支哈，亨利脫萊佛斯等十多人，全是聞名的明星。</p>
<p>攝影問題</p>
<p>「偉人安迪生」由却倫斯勃龍導演，小約翰　新頓監製，攝影一職由名攝影家哈勞爾羅遜担任。據這位攝影師事後表示：海蒂拉摩的美貌攝上影片，格外成功。而此片在實騐室攝影時，百分之九十的銳頭用煤氣燈，以及實騐室的天花板祇十呎高，不能使開麥拉利用角度，成為最大問題。要非對攝影有專長者，難能有良好的效果呢！</p>
<h3>「孔夫子」獻映有期</h3>
<p>民華影業公司首次貢獻費穆先鋒一導演的「孔夫子」，外問屢傳將在大光明或大華大戲院公映。民華對該片籌攝逾年，千錘百　，鄭重將事，耗資達二十萬之巨，願歸國片戲院放映，茲於前晚（一日）與金城大戲院簽訂合同，准於耶穌聖誕節左右作榮譽獻映。金城大戲院獲此鉅片，為示隆重起見，除自卽日起裝修全院外，並決於獻映期前，休業二日，以期屆時以全新面目與觀衆相見。觀眾對「孔夫子」渴望已久，曾觀該片試映者莫不交相稱譽，獻映有期，　此音訊，都拭目以待。</p>
<h3>國聯合同期滿　白虹加入金星　將演上海之歌</h3>
<p>— 家影</p>
<p>白虹主演「人間仙子」以後，便由歌壇一躍而為電影藝人，她的演技，近年來是更進步了。不久以前，有人說她要離開上海，結果事實粉碎了毀謗者的陰謀，最近她的國聯的合同期滿了，關於她今後的行止頗引起各方注意。</p>
<p>記者昨晤之於新新公司新商塲裏買東西，為了便利談話起見，便　到新商　附設的飲食部作簡要談話。</p>
<p>她說她和國聯合同到十一月十五日期滿，近來各公司都曾向她作幾次接洽，不過，經她幾次考慮之下，業於昨日下午接受金星的邀請而正式簽字了。</p>
<p>加入金星以後的白虹，其第一張影片大概是「上海之歌」。</p>
<h3>女藝人羣像</h3>
<p>— 唐塑</p>
<p>白玉艷</p>
<p>近一時期，刀馬旦的「打出手」在舞台上，行一時，擅長「打出手」工夫的，北伶以宋德珠閻世善稱一時瑜亮。在上海，以「打出手」而享盛名的男性刀馬旦，簡直是沒有；倒是坤角兒中出了一個白玉艷，以「打出手」負譽於時，為南方的紅氍毺上生色不少。</p>
<p>白玉艷小字玲弟，原籍杭州，而生長於上海，今年一十九歲，是白叔安（大世界乾坤大劇塲的後台經理）的女兒，白叔安科班出身，文武崑亂都來得，於是將腹笥中所有的都傳授給了女兒，其後又命玉艷從郭坤泉練武功，從水上飄（武錫堃的藝名練把式，而「打出手」則是　俊卿所授。此外男伶葛華卿趙綺霞谷玉蘭李琴仙，女伶碧玉貞等，都曾為玉艷說過戲，所以她除了刀馬戲之外，也兼工青衣花衫，筆者曾在更新舞台看過她的「四郎探母」，飾鐵鏡公主，演與唱都很不錯；但她的享名，則不是由於「打出手」，宋德珠閻世善所有的她無一不能，而她所能的技巧有些F却是宋閻所沒有的；就是內行，也一致承認她的出手，衝而又穩，能兼賅宋閻二家之長。環願江南戲壇，能「打出手」的坤角兒，白玉艷之外，確是沒有一個能與抗手的。</p>
<p>就為了她擅長「打出手」的緣故，當她在秋初加入共舞台之時，共舞台特地為她在「天河配」中排了一個武裝的織女，添了一幕殲妖的戲，使她有展其所長的機會。「天河配」中的織女表演大間打，這是先例所無的，而以白玉艷為首創。現在共舞台排演九本「濟公活佛」，她有打四根鞭的表演，精彩百出，大　戲觀衆所歡迎</p>
<p>她是一個皮簧劇從業員，但是她却嗜好話劇，她與唐若青很熟稔，她曾說：「如果有機會的話，我很想演一次話劇呢！」</p>
<h3>藝華攝「啼笑因緣」</h3>
<p>最近各製片公司，對於時裝片　漸趨熱烈，自張恨水「秦淮世家」被金星攝製後，繼之者有藝華公司之「啼笑因緣」，藝華籌攝此片之初，頗有以李綺年主演之意，後經數次會議，始決定用李麗華。聞李麗華在是片中歌大鼓一節，非常生動，一般認為李麗華將因「啼笑因緣」問世而更紅，藍「啼笑因緣」固為世人熟知之傑作；而李麗華演沈鳳喜，不啻為張恨水之理想人物。</p>

<h3>Ambassador Guo Visits the British Foreign Office; Britain Will Continue to Provide Loans to Aid China Following the US; Opinions Have Been Exchanged with Canada; The Soviet Union Guarantees Aid to China and Will Not Enter into Treaties with Japan</h3>
<p>London – Yesterday, leaders of the Foreign Office met with the Chinese and Japanese ambassadors stationed in London, causing a great stir in British diplomatic circles regarding Far Eastern issues. Japanese Ambassador Mamoru Shigemitsu visited Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax, while Chinese Ambassador Guo Taiqi held talks with diplomatic officials. It is understood that Shigemitsu visited of his own volition, attempting to explain the "Japan-Nanjing Treaty" and reaffirming Japan's repeated pledges to earnestly avoid friction with Britain and the United States. British officials anticipate that this treaty will be followed by further threats to the rights and interests of foreigners in Chinese-occupied areas, especially in Shanghai and treaty ports. Shigemitsu's conversation with Halifax apparently failed to alleviate British anxiety over this issue. British officials welcomed President Roosevelt's announcement of substantial new economic assistance. Ambassador Guo Taiqi also emphasized the willingness of Britain to provide new export loans to China. Britain is unconditionally happy to increase aid to China, but given that Britain itself has dramatically increased its wartime burden by aiding Greece, Turkey, and Egypt, the difficulty of the matter cannot be concealed. These obstacles may be somewhat reduced by obtaining the consent of British colonies to assist China. It is believed that London has exchanged views on this matter with Canada. (United Press dispatch from the 4th)</p>
<p>Stockholm – According to a report from the British News Agency, after the recent large loan from the United States to the Chinese government, those concerned in London are now also discussing the possibility of providing credit loans to Chongqing, with China supplying tungsten and antimony as collateral, as these minerals are needed by the British munitions industry. (Haitong News Agency dispatch from the 4th)</p>
<p>London – Due to the late arrival of the news of the US loan to China, Sunday's newspapers did not comment on it, but the Observer and the Reynolds News described the matter prominently. The front page of the Reynolds News also carried news of Foreign Secretary Halifax discussing war issues and rapid British-American cooperation in aiding China with Chinese Ambassador Guo Taiqi. The Reynolds News political correspondent stated that reports from the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Sir Stafford Cripps, and the US Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Steinhardt, have confirmed that the Soviet Union will continue to aid China and will never enter into any treaties with Japan that are hostile or provocative towards the United States. (Dispatch from the 4th)</p>
<p>Washington – US Secretary of State Hull declared that matters concerning the loan to China will henceforth be handled by the Treasury Department and the Export-Import Bank. Hull and Song Ziwen, Governor of the Central Bank, have already completed their discussions and will not hold any more meetings in the short term. The loan has already been approved by the joint meeting of the relevant committees of the Senate and the House of Representatives. (United Press dispatch from the 4th)</p>
<p>Washington – Yesterday's editorial in the Washington Star stated that if the "veiled threats" issued by Domei News Agency are true, then a major crisis in US-Japanese relations may not be far off. Domei News Agency recently stated that Japan and "Nanjing" may have to adopt drastic measures to deal with the United States, so the Star commented that while Japan's recognition of the "Nanjing regime" may be a farce diplomatically, it is also a serious and dangerous event. (United Press dispatch from the 4th)</p>
<p>Tokyo – Japanese newspapers in Tokyo continue to vehemently attack the US loan to China. The Miyako Shimbun called the loan an "unforgivable act of war" and stated that Japan may be forced to accept the challenge from the United States in order to protect Japanese interests and national honor. The Asahi Shimbun urged the Japanese government to resolve the Thai-Indochinese conflict in order to maintain its position as "leader of East Asia" and prevent Britain and the United States from "profiting from it." (Central News Agency dispatch from the 4th)</p>
<p>Chinese Military Has Made Progress; Financial Position Is Becoming More Solid</p>
<p>Washington – Financial experts here stated yesterday that they believe that Song Ziwen's success in obtaining the cooperation of the US Treasury Department will break through the recent mistrust of Chinese finances in Shanghai and other commercial ports. Song Ziwen and Hu Shi, the ambassador to Washington, have both striven to obtain a $50 million loan from the United States and the official expression that another $50 million will eventually be provided to consolidate Chinese finances. Financial experts further stated that although China's military position has improved, a lack of confidence is the main factor affecting the Chinese currency. The foreign exchange market in Shanghai is practically unrestricted, as the National Government under the leadership of General Chiang Kai-shek lacks regular national measures to restrict financial transactions and controls. The purchase of Chinese currency by Japan in various places to obtain foreign exchange is another reason for the decline in the Chinese yuan. Experts pointed out that the Sino-Japanese war and Japan's control of Chinese exports have restricted the export of goods, but this has little impact on the currency. The lack of factory goods has reduced exports, and Japan is also seizing raw materials shipped abroad. Authorities believe that the loan from the US Export-Import Bank will enable China to purchase more US raw materials and stabilize the legal tender. It is understood that Song Ziwen did not go to the Ministry of Finance yesterday to negotiate. (United Press dispatch from the 4th)</p>
<p>Chongqing Newspapers Continue to Praise the United States; Welcome the Dispatch of Experts to China</p>
<p>Chongqing – Newspapers here have recently continued to praise the US loan to China and especially welcome the dispatch of military and technical experts. Well-informed sources believe that the new loan strengthens China's morale and resistance, and that the American artillery and aircraft are needed to determine the struggle. They also stated that in order to facilitate the supply of American armaments to China, the area along the Burma Road and various airfields must be used as transport stations, and Chinese experts must be responsible for this important work. It was also stated that Chinese aviators have demonstrated excellent ability in the past eleven months, but they still need to cooperate with ground artillery personnel. Everyone here believes that US aid to China is a wise plan, and that the United States is currently paying a low insurance premium to maintain peace in the Pacific. (United Press dispatch from the 4th)</p>
<h3>British and American Cooperation in the Far East; To Be Discussed in the House of Commons</h3>
<p>London – The British House of Commons will now raise a very interesting question regarding British-American cooperation in the Far East, requesting the government to respond as soon as possible. Conservative Party member Morgan intends to suggest that Britain and the United States should jointly declare their opposition to the new order that Japan seeks to establish, not only in China but throughout the Pacific. Conservative Party member Conway will also ask the British government whether it can reiterate its policy towards the Nanjing regime to show that British and American objectives in the Far East are the same. (Reuters dispatch from the 4th)</p>
<h3>Anti-American Incidents Occur in Various Parts of Japan; The United States Has Called the Attention of the Japanese Foreign Ministry</h3>
<p>Tokyo – People here believe that the recent anti-American incidents in Japan are an organized movement by the Japanese to expel all foreigners from Japan. The incident on Monday at noon, where a Japanese person threw two baskets of excrement at the US Embassy in Tokyo, was not the first anti-American incident. A similar incident occurred in Kobe this summer, and the American consulate there was the target of the Japanese. In October and November, many disturbances occurred in the Hiroshima area, such as the publication of anti-American announcements in newspapers, the throwing of stones at American churches, and the forced entry into American church properties. On November 14, a group of Japanese rioters smashed the windows of the Hiroshima Girls' School, which has been run by Americans for fifty years, with large stones. On the same day, a group of Japanese thugs rioted in front of the American church, and advertisements with words such as "schools related to blockades and espionage," "expel foreign teachers of the Fifth Column from the country," and "resist Christian schools established by the enemy" have been found in newspapers such as the Nichinichi Shimbun. Currently, six female teachers at Hiroshima Girls' School have resigned and gone to Kobe and Osaka to recuperate. The remaining eight American professors are all Christians. The school authorities believe that their continued efforts seem impossible, because the students of the school are under pressure to continue their studies and stop studying at the school. What a Japanese person did at the American Embassy on Monday was witnessed by a female secretary. As a result, the US Embassy called the attention of the Japanese Foreign Ministry and requested that police be sent to protect the residence of US Ambassador to Japan, Joseph Grew. The female secretary said that she personally saw the Japanese person throw the excrement inside the walls of the embassy and immediately flee. Afterwards, the Japanese police patrolled the neighborhood all day to prevent accidents. (United Press dispatch from the 4th)</p>
<h3>British Far East Commander-in-Chief Issues Statement; Criticizes British-Japanese Relations; Cannot Guarantee Peace</h3>
<p>Singapore – Air Chief Marshal Sir Robert Brooke-Popham, the new Commander-in-Chief of the Far East Command, told a reporter from the Singapore Min Sheng Pao, which is run by the Japanese, today that although he is responsible for preparing for the eventuality that the war will extend to Malaya, he will do his best to prevent it. The reporter also asked for his criticism of British-Japanese relations, and he replied that there is no reason for a conflict. However, he cannot guarantee peace. Although there is no reason to panic at the moment, what happened in Europe could also happen in Asia. Finally, he answered questions about the preparedness of Malaya to resist, saying that Malaya can make it very difficult for the aggressor. The current position is capable of repelling any attack. (Reuters dispatch from the 4th)</p>
<h3>Kiichiro Hiranuma Enters the Cabinet Again</h3>
<p>Tokyo – Authorities announced today that former Prime Minister Baron Kiichiro Hiranuma will be appointed as a minister without portfolio in the current cabinet on Friday. Many believe that Hiranuma's entry into the cabinet will strengthen the position of the government. Hiranuma resigned on August 19 last year after the conclusion of the German-Soviet Pact. (Reuters dispatch from the 4th)</p>
<h3>Chinese Side Expresses Satisfaction with Germany's Attitude Towards Nanjing; Will Benefit Sino-German Relations; Abe Will Resign and Return to China Within the Month</h3>
<p>Chongqing – Germany issued a message yesterday stating that it has no intention of recognizing the "Nanjing regime" at present. Upon hearing this, people here expressed satisfaction, saying that according to the German-Italian-Japanese alliance, even if the signatory countries maintain close relations with each other, they can still maintain different relations with third countries. Well-informed sources said that if the above message is confirmed, then Sino-German relations will definitely benefit. (Havas dispatch from the 3rd)</p>
<p>London – London Radio announced today that although Japan has signed a treaty with the Wang Jingwei regime in Nanjing, Germany will continue its diplomatic relations with the National Government in Chongqing. Tokyo has not yet had any formal reaction to Germany's non-recognition of the Wang regime. (Reuters dispatch from the 4th)</p>
<p>Tokyo – It is heard that General Abe will resign from his position as ambassador to Nanjing and set off to return to China within the month. (Reuters dispatch from the 4th)</p>
<h3>The Greek Army's Victory Has Far-Reaching Repercussions; Japanese Confidence in the Axis Powers Is Gradually Shaken</h3>
<p>Washington – The victory of the Greek army in yesterday's war has had repercussions as far away as the Pacific. It is clear that Tokyo is now concerned about this. Well-informed diplomatic circles here believe that Japan will not take further steps to pursue any plans against the Dutch East Indies until the European political situation becomes clearer. People here believe that Japan joined the Axis powers because it believed that the Axis powers would win. Now that it has seen the unfavorable situation in Asia, it has suspended its plans for major actions near Saigon and Cam Ranh Bay. (Reuters dispatch from the 4th)</p>
<p>London – The manager of the London branch of the Yokohama Specie Bank recently expressed the opinion that the Japanese people are tired of war, have begun to expose German propaganda, and are gradually believing that Britain will win the war. German Propaganda Minister Goebbels has released a thick smoke screen in the world, and even Japan has been deceived by it. They are only now realizing that Hitler's invasion of Britain has failed. They recalled that Hitler had declared that he would arrive in London in August, September, and October, but he has not yet done so. (Reuters dispatch from the 4th)</p>
<h3>President Roosevelt Sails on a Ship; Allocates Funds to Develop Bases</h3>
<p>Miami – Roosevelt continued to travel by special train here yesterday afternoon. Immediately after arriving here, he transferred to the cruiser USS Tuscaloosa to patrol the Caribbean Sea. The destroyer USS Maury and USS Dupont escorted the president's ship. When the president departed, thousands of people gathered on the shore to cheer. The President is scheduled to return to the capital around December 15th and told the press before leaving that this trip was entirely for official business, meaning that it was not a fishing trip. This journey may stop at Jamaica, near the British naval base there. The United States has recently obtained a naval base from Britain. In addition, he may visit Culebra Island on December 7, where US Marines are currently conducting exercises. (United Press dispatch from the 4th)</p>
<p>Washington – The Army Department announced today that President Roosevelt has allocated $25 million to the Army for the development of the air and naval bases recently leased by Britain. (Reuters dispatch)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The United States Intensifies Aid to China and US-Japanese Relations</h3>
<p>Looking at the various developments in the Pacific in the past six months, there is reason to believe that the state of anarchy in the Far East is gradually becoming a thing of the past. Every new attempt at aggression or step taken is immediately met with major countermeasures and can no longer be carried out arbitrarily as in the past. For example, when Japan concluded an alliance with Germany and Italy, the United States and Britain immediately announced loans to China and embargoes on Japan, as well as the reopening of the Burma Road. After Abe signed the document in Nanjing, the United States passed a huge loan of 100 million yuan to China, and there were rumors that Britain and the Soviet Union would follow suit and provide loans to China. These situations prove on the one hand that China is supported by many, and on the other hand, it is enough to expose Japan's miscalculations and failures, which have led to major setbacks.</p>
<p>For several years, Japan's foreign policy has always focused on relations with the United States, and it has relied on this for the life of the cabinet. The Japanese authorities know that its expansion attempts are most opposed by the United States, and that the United States' unparalleled economic power is the lifeline of Japan. Therefore, it has exhausted all its efforts to be humble and respectful to the United States over the years, hoping to reduce the pressure from the United States and obstruct the United States' aid to China, so as to realize its great desire to monopolize the Far East. On the American side, there was no intention or preparation for armed conflict with Japan. Moreover, some people are concerned about the commercial interests between the United States and Japan and are unwilling to let the relations between the two countries become too rigid. Therefore, although the White House authorities have a clear understanding and great ambition for the Far Eastern issue, they have always failed to be very active in its application. As a result, although Japan has repeatedly encountered setbacks in the United States, it has not completely abandoned its dream of easing relations with the United States. They do not understand that the United States at that time was still hoping that Japan would realize its mistakes, so it was unwilling to go too far. Who knew that Japan mistakenly believed that it could deceive the United States, so it arbitrarily damaged the rights and interests of the United States, and even promoted its so-called new order. When the European war suddenly changed and France was defeated, the Japanese authorities mistakenly believed that the British Empire was about to collapse, so it deeply colluded with Germany and Italy in order to scare off the United States and carry out the division of the world. It then used threats and friendly gestures alternately in order to complete its invasion of China and its southward advance while avoiding the heavy pressure from the United States. However, the recent international situation is no longer effective for those who intentionally deceive. For example, the fact that the United States' huge loan to China was established at the same time as the Abe document shows that the United States was already alert and prepared for countermeasures, and was not deceived or delayed by Japan's diplomatic offensive. In the past, China had high hopes for the United States but did not receive them. Now, Japan is recklessly promoting its realization. This is a major blow to Japan's diplomacy towards the United States and a fatal failure of the Konoe policy, but it is also something that Japan has brought upon itself.</p>
<p>This US loan to China is the fourth since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese war. The previous $25 million tung oil loan in December 1938 and the $20 million tin ore loan in March of this year were both expressions of US support and friendship for China, but they were still commercial loans in nature and their uses were limited. The $25 million loan established in September to counter the Tripartite Pact was a direct loan to the Chinese government and was no longer restricted in its use, and gradually moved into the scope of political loans. As for the recently established US$100 million loan, its amount is greater than the sum of the previous three loans, and its political nature and significance are more obvious. In addition, it is considering providing China with military aircraft and other military supplies. This wise measure will increase China's courage and determination to resist the war, and its spiritual impact on China is as valuable as its actual effect. It is believed that these two great democratic countries on the east and west coasts of the Pacific will become more closely united in the future to achieve their common beliefs and goals. As for the Soviet Union and Britain, whether the rumors of loans are realized or not, under the current situation in the Far East, it is expected that they will be able to take similar or even parallel measures to the US government. If this cooperative relationship can continue to expand and deepen, then the precarious situation in the Far East will not be difficult to gradually stabilize in the future.</p>
<p>In recent days, Japanese rhetoric has been roaring again, and it has launched a major attack on the United States. Japan's attitude was repeatedly seen in September when the United States loaned money and imposed embargoes, and in early November when Roosevelt was elected for the third time. However, those opinions have not had any practical effect. The policy adopted by the Japanese government is not only not becoming tougher, but is responding with easing measures. Japan's current situation has not made progress due to its reckless actions, so the application of this policy towards the United States must not exceed the scope allowed by its strength. Now that Ambassador Nomura has not yet taken office in the United States, the Kokumin Shimbun, which represents the extreme faction, has asserted that he cannot improve the situation between the United States and Japan. However, apart from resorting to war, what other measures can be taken to deal with it? The Japanese authorities are probably very anxious about this, and it may even endanger the future of the Konoe cabinet. However, in today's Japan, it is impossible for the conservative forces to restore their original momentum in a short period of time, and the extreme elements' boastful words have no practical basis whatsoever. Therefore, under this new situation, where Japan is going is still a question to be decided.</p>
<h3>The National Government Rewards the Soldiers of Suiyuan; Fu Zuoyi Presents Medals on Behalf; The Ceremony of the Conferment Ceremony Was Grand</h3>
<p>A dispatch from a certain place in Suiyuan: The medals, certificates, and rewards issued by the former National Government and the Electrical Commission to the heroic soldiers of the previous battle in Suiyuan have recently arrived in Suiyuan and were ordered to be presented on behalf of Deputy Commander-in-Chief Fu.

<h3>Soviet Newspaper Comments on the Sino-Japanese War</h3>
<p>Chongqing – A Moscow message: The Red Star newspaper published an article today reviewing the war situation in China. It stated that after the Chinese army launched a counteroffensive in Central China, the Japanese army had stopped advancing on all fronts. The Chinese army had advanced to Jingmingpu. The main reason for the Japanese army's failure was that the Chinese army had too many soldiers, resulting in a disparity in numbers. In mountainous areas, the Japanese army could not use its combat techniques, such as using tanks. In the Yangtze River area, the Chinese army was extremely active. Since the Chinese army laid mines on the Yangtze River, it has been very difficult for the Japanese army to transport troops and munitions to the front lines in Hubei by water. The newspaper paid great attention to the activities of the Chinese army in North China, especially in the northern half of the city, and stated that after the Japanese army withdrew from Guangxi, the Chinese army had occupied various places at the junction of Guangxi and Guizhou. The Chinese army's position in South China is extremely consolidated. (Dispatch from the 3rd)</p>

<h3>Chongqing Rice Prices Soar, Government Implements Price Controls</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Recently, rice prices in Chongqing have nearly doubled. In August, the selling price was 30 yuan per *dou* (a unit of dry measure) (note: the *dou* used in Chongqing is larger and different from the one commonly used in Shanghai). Now, it has increased to 52 yuan. Although government agencies are selling broken rice to relieve the common people, the quantity is extremely small. Citizens are crowding to buy rice from various price-controlled entities. Based on the current situation, the amount spent on rice noodles by ordinary people each month is considerable. Therefore, the living conditions of general salaried workers, lower-level civil servants, and ordinary laborers are inevitably deeply strained.</p>
<p>In order to seek relief, the government authorities plan to procure rice and grains monthly to regulate the market. The National Food Administration has scheduled to implement price controls starting December 1st, for the general public, soldiers' families, students, and civil servants, etc., with a selling price of 60 yuan per *dan* (a unit of weight, about 50 kg), limited to 1,000 *dan* per day. However, it is found that the city's monthly rice demand is 250,000 *dan*. Therefore, the agency's daily price-controlled amount of 1,000 *dan* is obviously insufficient for distribution and must be increased accordingly.</p>
<p>In addition, the authorities are also taking various steps to facilitate grain merchants in purchasing rice from nearby districts and transporting it to Chongqing for sale. The current procedure for applying for rice transportation permits will naturally be abolished. From a general perspective, the price increases in Chongqing are not limited to rice and grains; all other daily necessities are also increasing. Economic experts have varied and inconclusive opinions on this price surge. Some attribute it to poor transportation, while others attribute it to currency inflation and hoarding by unscrupulous merchants. However, the foreign exchange market in Chongqing and the exchange rate between Chongqing and Shanghai have recently become more stable than before, indicating that the argument that currency inflation is promoting price increases is clearly untenable.</p>
<p>An objective analysis of the recent price increase situation suggests that the real reason is the lack of inventory in the city treasury. For example, Sichuan province originally had an adequate supply of rice and grains, but now a large part has already been supplied for military use or hoarded by various banks and merchants, leading to a sense of supply falling short of demand. What is even more hateful is that those who hoard are blinded by greed, often reaping profits three to four times their investment, yet they are still not satisfied. Therefore, the rice price increase has no end. These people should be held accountable. (Havas News Agency, 4th)</p>

<h3>Greek Army Advances on All Fronts Through Snow, Significant Progress Made, Northern Route Only Thirty Miles from Argyrokastron, Southern Route Occupies Bremi Heights</h3>
<p>Athens: Yesterday, Greek troops continued their fierce attacks on the Italian forces on all fronts, and have penetrated further into the eastern border of Albania. Correspondents from the Associated Press accompanying the leading Greek units reported that the main Greek forces are steadily advancing, undeterred by terrain obstacles such as mountains and wetlands, or climatic obstacles such as ice, snow, and cold. Greek forces are currently launching fierce attacks on the Italian forces entrenched in trenches on the shores and at the foot of the mountains near Lake Ohrid. According to the latest news received here, the Greek forces are only 400 yards away from the Italian forces. Wounded soldiers from both sides fighting fiercely in the wetlands are covered in mud. News from the captured cities of Ohrid and Struga in Yugoslavia also reported that Greek forces are clearing out the defeated Italian forces, and that the Greek forces in every area are advancing. Apart from an earlier report that the Italian forces had transferred reinforcements from their country to block the retreat of the Italian forces in Albania's Përmet region, no further news on this matter has been received since then. It is reported that the Greek forces' current progress in Albania has exceeded twice the area previously invaded by the Italian forces into Greek territory. (Associated Press, 4th)</p>
<p>Athens: Unofficial news came yesterday from the battle zone in Albania that the Greek forces on the southern front had won after a six-day battle with the Italian forces. They have now crossed the Thyrion, broken through the Italian defensive lines between Argyrokastron and Sarandë. It is claimed that another Greek detachment is advancing north along the coast towards Sarandë, so that this most important southern base of the Italian side has actually been isolated by the Greek forces. Although there is five feet of snow on the second line in the central district and on the front line in the far north, the Greek forces are also reported to be advancing. According to front-line reports, the Greek forces on the central and southern lines in the Pindus Mountains climbed barefoot the steep, cliff-like peaks of Mount Policia, which reach 7,500 feet, and then charged down at risk, directly attacking the Italian forces with bayonets. As a result, the Greek forces gained control of Bremi and are now planning to attack Tepelenë from there. (International News Service, 4th)</p>
<p>Athens: Semi-official sources claim that the Greek forces, advancing rapidly through the snow, have reached a point less than one and a quarter miles from Sarandë (the Italian side's main landing port in Albania). The Greek forces have also captured an important high ground controlling the city of Argyrokastron from the east. Both places are currently continuing to attack the Italian forces amidst heavy wind and snow. The snow is thickest on the northern front, where the Italian forces are retreating from Pogradec towards Elbasan, while the Greek forces are pursuing directly north along Lake Ohrid. Now that the fall of Sarandë is imminent, the Italian forces are suddenly expediting the continued northward movement of their supply lines. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>London: The Greek forces have made new progress northeast of Argyrokastron, occupying a village and high ground overlooking Bremi. Bremi is a small town on the central front and is very important strategically. It is now believed that the Italian forces will be forced to abandon the town without a fight. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>Budapest: According to news arriving here from the battle zone, the Greek forces, unexpectedly detouring through the high mountains in central Albania, reached a point thirty miles from the Albanian capital, Tirana, this morning. (International News Service, 4th)</p>
<p>Struga, Yugoslavia: According to reports received here, the Greek forces in the Konispol area advanced ten kilometers forward on Sunday and occupied the village of Markat. The Greek forces in the Gjirokastër area advanced nine miles on Sunday night and reached Mount Radonës. The Greek forces in the Moscopole area have also advanced ten kilometers in the past 24 hours, occupying the village of Kinikas on the river of Socha. Greek and Italian artillery are very active there. Another Greek force departed from Moscopole, crossed the wide river of Kalama, and advanced southwest. The Italian forces' attack on the village of Velezhda yesterday was repelled. (Associated Press, 4th)</p>
<p>Athens: It is reported that the Greek forces today occupied the last mountain pass between the Platorvouni Mountains and the Sarandë Mountains in northwestern Albania. Battle reports said that the Greek forces in the Bremi area occupied the perilous 4,000-foot high Mount Orgeni last night after a bloody battle. Greek forces in the northern district, in severe weather, drove out the enemy from the northwest fortress of Moscopole and captured strategically important positions. Sources in Athens said today that the Greek forces have captured a large number of prisoners in the northern district. Unofficial sources in Athens claim that the Greek forces heading towards Sarandë have broken through the Italian defensive lines between Argyrokastron and the Adriatic Sea. (Note: London's News Chronicle reported today that the Italian side has not been able to send a single troop ashore in Albania in the past eight days, and can only transport reinforcements by air, as the Greek side's bombing has rendered the main ports useless.) (International News Service, 4th)</p>
<p>London: Reuter's Athens correspondent recently stated that the left flank of the Greek forces, closely pursuing the retreating Italian forces, has now advanced to a key point only two miles from Sarandë, a major seaport in southwestern Albania. The correspondent also relayed authoritative news that the central wing of the Greek forces has occupied Mount Platorvouni. The Greek forces can launch further attacks from this mountain, or suppress the strong resistance of the Italian forces. In the eastern region, the Greek forces, after a fierce battle that caused heavy casualties to the Italian forces, advanced to a key point northeast of Libohovë. Near Bremi, the Greek forces captured 100 Italian soldiers. The Italian forces on Mount Quenia have been forced to withdraw from the mountain, as a force of Italian soldiers north of the mountain has been defeated. The right wing of the Greek forces, despite the severe weather, continues to attack relentlessly and has now advanced east of Moscopole, forcing the Italian forces to withdraw from this strategically important plateau. (Associated Press, 4th)</p>
<p>British Air Force Assists Greek Operations, Vlorë Port Heavily Attacked</p>
<p>London: In the past 24 hours, the port of Sarandë in Albania has felt the threat of the Greek forces even more intensely than before, so the retreat of the Italian forces in the Argyrokastron area is said to be even faster than their retreat from Korçë. British bombers are harassing the Italian rear. The Italian forces retreating from the Argyrokastron area will inevitably retreat to the port of Vlorë. The British Air Force, braving severe weather, heavily bombed the port of Vlorë. Although the Italian side had a large number of fighter planes patrolling, they were unable to prevent the British planes from bombing. A large building near the port of Vlorë was hit and caught fire, with continuous explosions like thunder. The British planes also dropped a batch of bombs on the main docks. One bomb hit a shipyard, and an Italian fighter plane was shot down. In the Argyrokastron area, British fighter planes also shot down an Italian reconnaissance plane. The squadron leader of the British planes that bombed Vlorë stated after returning to base that the mission was very successful. The British planes flew quite low due to cloud cover. Although the Italian fighter planes engaged, some British planes lured the enemy planes away, and the remaining planes took the opportunity to fly in and drop bombs. They saw warehouses being hit and exploding, with black smoke everywhere. The British planes dropped their bombs on target, and all planes returned safely. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>Greek Navy Achieves War Successes, Cunningham Expresses Admiration</p>
<p>Athens: Sir Andrew Cunningham, Commander-in-Chief of the British Mediterranean Fleet, recently sent a letter to the Greek Navy, expressing his admiration for the Greek Navy, from the commander to the sailors, for carrying out their arduous work in this time of war. He specifically mentioned the successes achieved by Greek destroyers and submarines in areas frequently patrolled by superior enemy naval forces. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>Blackshirts Can't Endure Hardship, Stricken by Hunger and Cold, Many Die</p>
<p>London: It is heard that the number of Italian soldiers captured by the Greek forces in the recent Battle of Pogradec who are sick is increasing daily. The Italian soldiers are suffering greatly from the extreme cold and heavy snow. Most of the Italian soldiers cannot endure this hardship. According to news from the battle zone, the Greek forces, after winning, closely pursue the fleeing Italian forces, often leaving their camps amidst wind and snow before finishing their meals. The Italian forces wanted to bury landmines on their retreat route, but the Greek forces had already reached the mountain passes, so they fled in haste before they could bury them. The Greek forces were thus spared danger and continued to pursue and encircle several units of the Italian forces. Many Italian soldiers have died, causing the Greek commander-in-chief to have to designate several special areas to bury enemy corpses, lest they hinder the hygiene of the advancing Greek forces. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>Italy Continues to Call Up Young Men, Turkey Watches Italo-Greek War Situation</p>
<p>London: It is heard that Italy is currently calling up 19-year-old young men to enlist in the army. Turkey is closely watching the Greek war of resistance. According to news from Ankara, it is said that their opinion is that the Greek forces' advance, especially those on the southern front, is making steady progress, without encountering any strong resistance. The Italian forces are currently in a very difficult situation. With the high ground controlling Argyrokastron occupied by the Greek forces, the fall of the city is imminent. (Reuters, 4th)</p>

<h3>Soviet Military Delegation Arrives in Bulgaria, Soviet-Bulgarian Relations Improve, Bulgarian Foreign Minister Clarifies Policy, Maintains Friendship with Neighboring Countries</h3>
<p>Sofia: A Soviet military delegation arrived yesterday at the Bulgarian port of Burgas on the Black Sea coast. At the same time, Bulgarian officials announced that Soviet-Bulgarian relations have "further improved." Although the purpose of the delegation's visit was kept secret, political observers generally believe that the delegation's arrival is an indication of closer relations between the Soviet Union and Bulgaria. At the time of the delegation's arrival, Bulgarian Foreign Minister Ivan Popov was giving a speech in the National Assembly, subtly attacking Germany's pressure to include Bulgaria in the Axis powers. Popov said, "The main goal of the Bulgarian government is to avoid war, and the best way to maintain peace is to increase military preparedness and refuse to sign new international conventions. Our relations with the Soviet Union are improving." When mentioning the recent friction over the Macedonian issue, Popov said, "Bulgaria intends to work hard to contact Yugoslavia, so as to meet our goal of permanent friendship." When mentioning Turkish-Bulgarian relations, Popov only said, "Our relations with Turkey are also quite friendly." According to news from Ankara, Turkey has decided to double its annual military spending, bringing the total to 26,000,000 yuan. (International News Service, 8th)</p>

<h3>Birmingham, the Industrial Center of London, Suffers Another Air Raid, British Planes Attack German Naval Bases at Night, Naples Port in Italy Hit and Catches Fire</h3>
<p>London: Yesterday evening, a swarm of German planes flew to East Anglia and southwestern England, with about a dozen planes dropping bombs on the outskirts of London. It was also heard that bombs fell in Sussex and East Anglia, but the losses and casualties were minimal. Last night's alarm in London was the earliest in recent days, starting at 4:30 PM (London time). (Associated Press, 4th)</p>
<p>A City in West Midland: Last night, a swarm of German planes launched a fierce attack on this city, continuing to wreak havoc for four hours from dusk, with only a 25-minute pause in between. The German planes first dropped a number of incendiary bombs here, and then several squadrons of bombers flew in, following their usual tactics, dropping a large number of high-explosive bombs and time bombs. Before dropping the high-explosive bombs, the German planes first dropped flares, and also dropped incendiary bombs to create light to illuminate the targets. However, the fires caused by the incendiary bombs were quickly extinguished. (Reporters say that this city is clearly Birmingham, as German sources in Berlin had said that Birmingham was the main target of the German planes last night. This city had previously suffered two fierce bombings. The heavily damaged areas include six locations. However, it is heard that the casualties were very few. The first air raid last night lasted 90 minutes. After a short pause after the first bombing, the second bombing started again, with the German planes repeating the fierce tactics of the previous time, bombing the city for two and a half hours without stopping. Two schools, two furniture warehouses, and many residences were the targets of the German planes. The bombed residences have been razed to the ground. A strongly built basement was also hit by a bomb. Nineteen civilians were living in the basement, but only one was killed. The rest fled in a panic in the midst of the crisis. (Associated Press, 4th)</p>
<p>London: According to the British Air Ministry, London and the Midlands were again the targets of German bombing last night, but after 10:00 PM, the raiders left, and the British skies were then clear of German planes. Yesterday's air raid in England, although quite active, was not very large in scale. Last night's Nazi attack seemed to be a complete failure, as only a few places caught fire in the Midlands area, and the fires were soon brought under control. No major fires were reported in the London area either, and no important facilities were damaged in London's capital area. Some bombs also fell in the area between London and the Midlands coast, but the casualties were minimal. Only three places caught fire in the London area, and they were immediately extinguished. Two cinemas in London were hit by several incendiary bombs, and the bombs exploded in the crowd of spectators. However, the spectators calmly left the cinemas and walked to the streets without panic. A monastery recently converted into a public shelter was also hit by a high-explosive bomb yesterday, killing several people. Several high-explosive bombs also fell on the outskirts of London. Several high-explosive bombs also fell in front of a hospital in an outlying area. The walls and water pipes of the hospital were destroyed by the explosions, and a large fire broke out, with flames lasting half an hour. However, there were no casualties in the hospital and nearby houses. Two bombs fell in another area, damaging several buildings and causing several casualties. (Associated Press, 4th)</p>
<p>London: Last night, the British Air Force's bombing of the German naval bases was quite successful. The German submarine base of Lorient in the Bay of Biscay was heavily attacked by British planes, with large and small bombs raining down. A German ship off the coast of Norway was hit, and a supply ship also had its stern hit. The British planes all returned safely afterwards. Last night, long-range bombers of the British Air Force in the Near East flew over the Mediterranean Sea and dropped bombs on the port of Naples in Italy, hitting railway junctions and oil refineries. A large fire suddenly broke out, illuminating the area 20 miles away. The main tracks were also bombed. At the same time, the Catania airfield was also attacked. Incendiary bombs were dropped and fires broke out in several places. One enemy plane on the ground was completely destroyed. The Augusta airfield was also hit and caught fire. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<h3>German Air Force Hero Wick Dies</h3>
<p>Berlin: This afternoon, the German military bulletin claimed that a German submarine had once again achieved a great feat, sinking as many as six enemy merchant ships (31,500 tons) with armed escorts with one submarine. This is truly rare. The night before, German planes bombed the harbor of Bristol, and although the weather was bad, the bombs were quite accurate. Southampton and London were both bombed. Several planes parked in the airfield of Sheringham were destroyed by explosions. Ordnance factories, barracks, and transportation equipment were hit. Last night, German planes bombed central and southern England. British planes attacked central and southwestern Germany, causing minimal losses. Major Wick, who had achieved the special achievement of shooting down 56 enemy planes, is unfortunately missing and is feared to have died for his country. (Haitong News Agency, 4th)</p>
<h3>Germany Will Launch New Submarine Tactics Against Britain, Germany Claims to Have Sunk a Total of Twenty British Ships in One Day, Totaling 160,000 Tons</h3>
<p>Berlin: Neutral sources say that Germany will use at least 100 submarines, divided into several large groups, as the mainstay of its winter war against Britain. In the past, German submarines lurked alone in various seas, but now they will change to new tactics, deploying entire teams in key locations to search for convoys, replacing the previous single submarines. This statement has been officially confirmed. (Associated Press, 4th)</p>
<p>Berlin: Well-informed sources in Germany claim that German submarines sank 165,000 tons of British ships on Sunday. Another two ships, totaling 16,000 tons, were also mostly sunk. Of the 165,000 tons, 110,000 tons belonged to an entire convoy. In this attack, Captain Mengersen's submarine sank 41,000 tons. Another submarine sank two ships totaling 21,000 tons, one of which was the "Victoria" ship. (Associated Press, 4th)</p>
<p>Berlin: This morning, German newspapers published on their front pages the great achievement of German submarines sinking 20 enemy ships in one day, totaling 160,000 tons. According to the Berlin Morning Post, 160,000 tons in wartime is equivalent to 230,000 tons, which is the equivalent of 11,500 modern railway freight cars, with each car carrying a load of 20 tons. The loss of such a large amount of goods is particularly serious during wartime. Britain suffers the loss of shipwrecks day and night, and as the days and months accumulate, Britain's situation will become unbearable. There will be less and less external supply, and the scope of destroyed factories will become wider and wider. Eventually, an Englishman will suffer the pain of starvation.

<h3>The Pope Appeals to the Warring Nations to Temporarily Cease Hostilities on Christmas, Berlin Expresses Its Attitude</h3>
<p>Vatican City: Authorities in the Diocese indicated today that Pope Pius XII is currently using diplomatic means to appeal to the warring nations to cease fire on Christmas Day. It is believed that the Pope will use diplomatic pressure to achieve his goal. Although Germany and Britain have already stated that they cannot accept this truce, the Pope has still issued a declaration, urging all nations to at least temporarily cease hostilities on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. (International News Service, 4th)</p>
<p>Vatican City: Since the Catholic bishops of the warring nations asked the Pope how to hold this year's Christmas Eve Mass, the Pope immediately instructed the bishops to move the Mass to the afternoon so as not to violate the lighting control regulations. At the same time, the Pope expressed his hope for peace in his instructions. (Associated Press, 4th)</p>
<p>Berlin: When foreign reporters here inquired about the proposal for a ceasefire during the Christmas season, German authorities replied that Berlin had not heard anything about it, and that British Prime Minister Churchill had already declared that Britain would never consider the proposal for a ceasefire. Therefore, discussing this matter again under such circumstances would be fruitless. (Haitong News Agency, 4th)</p>
<p>Painful History of the European War (4)</p>
<h3>The Inside Story of Daladier and Reynaud: A Nation Misled by Romance</h3>
<p>This chapter is another excerpt from "The Tragedy of France," a new work by French historian André Maurois, translated below:</p>
<p>Throughout history, partisanship and infighting among authorities have frequently impacted battles and hindered national governance. In 1918, France was fortunate to have a strong and capable leader who suppressed disruptive elements. This man was Georges Clemenceau, known as the "Tiger Premier." However, France in 1939 was different. While Daladier and Reynaud, the men in power, were undoubtedly loyal, they were fundamentally incompatible. Throughout the war, they continued to plant parties and fight for power, causing conflict without end. France's misfortune was, in large part, due to their irreconcilable feud.</p>
<p>On the day of King George VI's coronation at Westminster Abbey, I was also in attendance. As Reynaud entered, a British officer sitting next to me suddenly asked, "Who is that short man with the Japanese face?"</p>
<p>I replied, "Don't let his small stature fool you; he is the future Prime Minister of France."</p>
<p>Mrs. Reynaud, Christiane Henriette Robutel, was the beloved daughter of a famous lawyer and a close friend of my wife. Because of this connection, I paid particular attention to Reynaud's career. He was intelligent and courageous, a rare quality among politicians. During the sterling depreciation, Reynaud was the only one who dared to advocate for the devaluation of the French franc. Later, when forced by the situation, the devaluation of the franc was ultimately unavoidable. Colonel de Gaulle advocated for the mechanization of the army and the formation of powerful armored divisions, and Reynaud was among the few French officials who paid attention to and studied his ideas. France generally allowed its youth to drift, but Reynaud wrote a pamphlet titled "France as Expected by the Youth," a loud call to awaken the nation.</p>
<p>Before the war, France faced a financial crisis, and Reynaud took office as Minister of Finance. Within weeks of his appointment, the national treasury had increased by billions of francs in gold. He would occasionally be struck by an idea, suddenly leap up, put his hands in his pockets, stick out his chest, raise his head, and speak with a hammering voice, full of power, which I found particularly captivating. We often jokingly called him "Little Rooster," hoping he would fight for justice.</p>
<p>However, despite his intelligence, he was competitive and overly confident, which made him arrogant. While his arguments were often brilliant, his language could be sharp. When discussing financial and economic issues with outsiders, he had an air of self-importance, which naturally aroused resentment among politicians. Daladier, in particular, could not stand him.</p>
<p>Daladier was as eloquent as Reynaud, but his manner of speaking was not as boastful or overbearing. He was sincere and his words were moving, suggesting a heart full of worries. Whenever Daladier gave public speeches about the war, regardless of whether the audience was farmers, merchants, or industrialists, they all regarded him as a mentor to the French people due to his friendly tone, dignified voice, and sincere love of peace.</p>
<p>Daladier had been a history professor, and his original sincerity, combined with his historical background, further fueled his enthusiasm to serve the country. However, his many virtues were offset by two major flaws. First, he was impatient and suspicious, distrusting his colleagues. Second, he was indecisive, sometimes holding no opinion at all. He would occasionally fly into a rage, pounding the table with his fist, but despite the fierce expression, his colleagues said he was nothing more than an "empty fist" and that he was like "a pair of tender hands inside an iron glove," strong on the outside but weak on the inside. However, the public only saw his outwardly motivated and capable appearance and did not know his true character. Therefore, they gave him the nickname "Little Bull of Camargue," hoping he would take decisive and surprising action.</p>
<p>One day, I asked Reynaud, "If Daladier were to leave office, who would be your ideal successor?"</p>
<p>He replied, "In the minds of the French people, it would still be Daladier."</p>
<p>Daladier's impetuousness, irritability, and suspicious nature led him to quarrel with Édouard Herriot, the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies. They both belonged to the Radical Socialist Party, both named Édouard, but they were like fire and water, tearing the Radical Party apart. A play by Bette described a character who was suspicious and indecisive, even hesitant to go to church as the groom on his wedding day. Reynaud often said that Daladier was that kind of person. He originally promoted radicalism, but later organized the Popular Front, which was hoped for by the conservative middle class, precisely because of his changeable nature! Daladier would often retort, "When Reynaud speaks, he is always smug and self-satisfied, making it unbearable. I think he is like a peacock spreading its tail, strutting around and showing off."</p>
<p>At that time, France was engaged in a battle for survival, and the two men, burdened with the important task of leading the nation, should have worked together to overcome the difficulties. However, they each clung to their own opinions and were unable to reach an agreement. They were also poisoned by the gossiping whispers of women, which naturally led to resentment and hatred.</p>
<p>At first glance, this matter may seem insignificant and unrelated to the great tragedy of France, so why mention it? However, on the one hand, all the main facts are already known to the world, and on the other hand, the private lives of some French politicians undeniably hindered their public duties, so it cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>It would be a mistake to say that the French nation was corrupt in 1939. Countless good people were living their simple and peaceful lives. However, in Paris, there were more than three thousand people who were different from the rest. They were like the poets Byron described, "Because they slept well, they thought they were the leaders of the world." They indulged in pleasure without regard, unaware that these romantic entanglements would bring disaster to the country. Therefore, to be a leader of a nation, one must first be able to control one's desires.</p>
<p>After Daladier's marriage ended, he became entangled with the Marquise de Crussol. The Marquise was beautiful, elegant, and had skin as white as snow and a face that could captivate a city. Although she liked power and loved politics and economics, she stayed behind the scenes and did not want to elevate her lover or flaunt him to the world. Because she adhered to her role, she did not cause much harm to the country.</p>
<p>However, Countess Hélène de Portes, Reynaud's mistress, was somewhat restless, meddlesome, and truly a dangerous figure, as will be seen later.</p>
<p>One day, in front of Reynaud, I criticized a questionable appointment made by Daladier.</p>
<p>Reynaud said that it was not Daladier's intention, but "hers."</p>
<p>I said, "There is no excuse for that."</p>
<p>Reynaud sighed and said, "You don't know how much a busy man needs sweetness at night!"</p>
<p>When the war broke out, she—Reynaud's mistress—became ambitious, not satisfied with Reynaud being Minister of Finance. She disregarded everything and pushed him to the position of Prime Minister. She spread rumors everywhere that Daladier lacked perseverance and had no achievements, saying that Reynaud's succession as Prime Minister was imminent. These rumors would naturally reach Daladier's ears, which deepened his hatred for Reynaud. The two men were members of the wartime cabinet and, for a time, did not even speak to each other. This was truly an absurd situation, and the overall situation of the country was therefore unimaginable.</p>
<p>On March 19, Daladier's cabinet was on the verge of collapse. The failure of the Finnish war caused anger in the parliament, accusing Daladier of failing to provide timely assistance. This criticism may not have been fair, because it was truly difficult to form an expeditionary force and send it to Finland. Even if it had been sent, it might have ended in utter defeat.</p>
<p>However, the parliamentarians ignored these considerations. They requested a closed-door meeting, which lasted all afternoon without a result. The meeting continued at ten o'clock that night.</p>
<p>Reynaud came to my house at eight o'clock for dinner. He said to us, "That unlucky Daladier is really suffering today. I wouldn't be surprised if his cabinet falls tonight."</p>
<p>My wife interjected, "Who would be the next Prime Minister?"</p>
<p>Reynaud replied, "That depends on the President's intentions and the factors that led to Daladier's downfall." (To be continued)</p>

<h3>The Reasons and Treatment for Kidney Deficiency in Men After Marriage</h3>
<p>—Co-authored by Dr. Yao Chongpei, American Medical Doctor, and Dr. Zhan Nianceng, Venereal Disease Specialist</p>
<p>(Clinic) 2nd Floor, China Trust Company, corner of Beijing Road and Sichuan Road (Hours) 10 AM to 6 PM, Closed on Sundays</p>
<p>Kidney deficiency is the destroyer of love between couples and shortens lifespan.</p>
<p>If a man develops kidney deficiency after marriage, the love between the couple will inevitably be affected. This is because marriage is a union based on sexual relations. A man with abundant energy and a beautiful and graceful woman will undoubtedly lead a sweet life. Therefore, the couple's love is strong, they bear clever and healthy children, and they form a happy and fulfilling family. How wonderful is that! But if a man has kidney deficiency and a lack of energy, the couple's life cannot be complete, and their love will inevitably be damaged. In recent newspapers and magazines, or in casual conversations, we often hear or see cases of marital disputes or divorces in court, where the wife speaks eloquently about how the husband is unable to perform his marital duties, and she is wasting her youth, unable to make sacrifices. In addition, if a husband's kidney deficiency is left untreated, his body will gradually weaken, and he may die from illness, leaving behind orphans and a widow. According to statistics and research on the deaths of young husbands by a certain doctor, there are alarming numbers! Therefore, kidney deficiency in men after marriage is a serious problem that should be given attention by doctors today.</p>
<p>Why do so many men have kidney deficiency after marriage? The main reason is that men often masturbate or experience nocturnal emissions during their spring awakening, or because of marital debauchery and indulgence. Overuse of the brain, or damage from work, congenital weakness, or imbalances after illness are also occasional causes. In mild cases, there are often no obvious symptoms on the outside. As the condition progresses, it is often accompanied by neurasthenia and decreased metabolic function. Therefore, symptoms such as headaches, forgetfulness, insomnia, tinnitus, blurred vision, back pain, seminal emission, spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, impotence, sallow complexion, thin muscles, fear of cold, aversion to heat, and mental fatigue will follow one another, leaving the person struggling in depression and fatigue all day long. The pain of life is difficult to describe!</p>
<p>According to world-renowned doctors and my many years of experience, the most effective and specific treatment for this condition is the "Testosterone" preparation, which is a reproductive hormone preparation. This preparation is based on actual needs, and countless world medical experts have devoted their life's experience to researching and experimenting with each other. It is made by extracting reproductive hormones from strong animals such as apes and chimpanzees, resulting in the effects of curing diseases, prolonging life, and rejuvenating. This has shocked the modern world medical community. Dr. Steinach, a leading European physiologist, has made the greatest contribution to the invention of this preparation, so the preparation is named "Steinach's Testosterone." This drug is pure in quality and acts through the principle of replenishing. After taking it, it can produce sperm and replenish the kidneys, strengthen the brain, activate blood circulation, nourish nerves, and promote metabolism within a day and night, without stimulating the yang, invigorating the stomach, exciting the nerves, or causing other side effects. If you continue to take it, you will be able to completely cure the above symptoms in a short period of time, and it can prolong life. However, those with seminal emission must also take "Himeito's Jing Solidifying Pills" to strengthen the seminal gate and stop leakage, which will make the effect faster. If patients can come to our clinic for expert diagnosis and receive scientific treatments such as electrotherapy, injections, and surgery, a cure can be guaranteed.</p>
<h3>The Sorrow and Salvation of Untreated Seminal Emission</h3>
<p>—Venereal Disease Specialist Zhan Nianceng</p>
<p>Without a doubt, the most common problem that every man faces during adolescence is masturbation. Although this habit seems simple and contemptible, once a young person engages in it, it can easily become a habit. Once the habit is formed, it is like being addicted to smoking. Although one knows the harm, one cannot completely quit. Because one cannot completely quit, the reproductive glands are the first to be damaged, the seminal gate relaxes, and the ensuing result is seminal emission.</p>
<p>From a health perspective, seminal emission is the most harmful to the brain, sexual organs, and spinal cord nerves. Therefore, once a young person suffers from this evil disease, their thinking ability will decline rapidly. At the same time, memory loss, back pain, tinnitus, heart palpitations, and night sweats will occur. What is even more frightening is that the youth-producing function is severely affected, and the sexual organs become as small as a child's. Moreover, because the seminal gate opens and closes too frequently, the muscles around the seminal vesicle relax, leading to sudden spermatorrhea and leakage, which can cause impotence and premature ejaculation. This kind of young person not only suffers severe blows to their own health and great future but also often causes their wife to hate them because they cannot fulfill their responsibilities in their marital life! As a result, they feel guilty inside, are restrained by their wives outside, and feel ashamed and resentful! Their pain is almost indescribable!</p>
<p>Regarding the method of rescuing this condition, first, the patient must clear their mind of desires, avoid bad contacts, exercise diligently, and quit bad habits. Every night before going to bed, wash the area with cold water, pay attention to urination, and take four "Himeito's Jing Solidifying Pills" to strengthen the seminal gate. Then seminal emission can be stopped on the same night. If, due to frequent sperm leakage, there are various symptoms of weakness as mentioned above, then the reproductive hormone preparation "Testosterone" should also be taken. This preparation is extracted from the reproductive glands of lions, tigers, chimpanzees, sea dogs, etc., and is mixed with precious minerals and plant substances, and is scientifically produced. Therefore, within a day and night of taking it, it can produce sperm, nourish the kidneys, strengthen the brain, and benefit the marrow. If you continue to take it and persevere, then even an extremely weak body and extremely vicious seminal emission and spermatorrhea can be completely cured in a short period of time.</p>
<p>Beauty</p>
<h3>How to Achieve Healthy and Beautiful Breasts</h3>
<p>—American Medical Doctor Yao Chongpei</p>
<p>Healthy and beautiful breasts are a necessary condition for modern women</p>
<p>A pair of towering breasts on a woman's chest certainly helps to enhance her beauty, ensure her ability to have children, and facilitate the convenience of breastfeeding. Therefore, promoting breast development is of utmost value. The wheels of time are moving forward, and the development of women's breasts is an example of the progress of the times. We should unanimously agree with and strive to assist them in their success! However, with deeply rooted habits, most of the women we see have flat breasts and thin faces, showing signs of premature aging. Therefore, for women with some new knowledge, how to make their breasts healthy and beautiful has indeed become a common and important issue. In our medical judgment, the special development of breasts is a characteristic of female physiology. The development of this physiological characteristic is based on the function of the woman's ovaries. If the ovarian function is sound, then not only will the breasts naturally rise, but the hips will also develop, the voice will be like a warbling bird, and the temperament will be gentle and affectionate. At the same time, the metabolic function will be vigorous, and the skin, muscles, blood, and other parts will be filled with new cells. Therefore, the skin is white and tender, the muscles are plump, and the blood is full and bright red, which makes the face flushed like a peach blossom. Without the need for makeup, she is already extremely beautiful. Although age increases, she can maintain her youth. Marital life is bound to be very sweet, and she will bear clever and healthy children, forming a happy and fulfilling family. What a happy woman! However, women who have had their chests bound in the past, or who have hidden ailments such as leukorrhea, a lack of sensation, or irregular menstruation, will inevitably have their ovarian function damaged, resulting in flat breasts and a fading face. There is no hope for fertility, and the love between husband and wife is weak. Her fate must be extremely miserable! The only remedy is to take the ovarian preparation "Testosterone" for women to nourish the ovarian function and invigorate the metabolism. Then the breasts can be raised within ten days, and the above-mentioned hidden ailments can be eliminated at once. It is truly a good gynecological medicine for promoting beauty and eliminating diseases.</p>

<h3>Tensions Subside on Thai-Vietnamese Border; Officials Hope for Successful Negotiations; Thai Artillery Fires on French Armored Transport Ship</h3>
<p>Hanoi: Yesterday, there were no major battles on the Thai-Vietnamese border. Officials hope that the negotiations by French Minister to Bangkok, Mr. Garreau, will succeed before the dry season arrives, as the dry season would provide an opportunity for large-scale battles. Although the border situation is serious, French officials are still making sarcastic remarks, saying, "Will Vietnam attempt to invade with armored elephant brigades?" According to French sources, the Siamese fired machine guns at the town of Dak To (phonetic translation) on Sunday night and dropped leaflets along the Mekong River. Fighting has occurred intermittently along the Thai-Vietnamese border from Vientiane, the capital of Laos, to the Gulf of Siam, but these have been minor skirmishes. French officials do not believe Bangkok's claims that a French warship was sunk in the Mekong River. The French side claims that the activities of native "Fifth Columns" in the Binh Dinh province are forcing French authorities to make efforts to suppress native rebellions. A Thai pilot and a Thai reconnaissance officer were reportedly captured after mistakenly landing at the Cambodian airfield of Loviéa on the Thai border. (United Press, 4th)</p>
<p>Saigon: According to an official announcement, a Thai military aircraft invaded French Vietnamese airspace this afternoon and was forced to land in the Bansi Sisa Phon district of Cambodia. The pilot was not injured and has been detained by Vietnamese authorities. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<p>Kunming: It is reported that some French nationals in Yunnan Province, including some men, have been ordered by the French government to serve in the military to resist the Thai invasion of Vietnam. Many of these French nationals will be leaving Yunnan soon. (United Press, 4th)</p>
<p>Vichy: Regarding the border dispute between Vietnam and Thailand, authorities here announced yesterday that a foreign news agency had issued a report stating that fighting had occurred on the Thai-Vietnamese border and that Thai forces had occupied three locations within Vietnamese territory. This report is purely fabricated and has no basis in reality. Since November 27th, the Thais have caused various incidents in Vietnam, and on November 27th and 29th, and December 1st and 2nd, they bombed the Vietnamese villages of Thakhek and Savannakhet four times. Vietnamese authorities have taken all necessary measures on the border to maintain order. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<p>London: According to an official statement released in Bangkok, a warship carrying French troops invaded Thai territory, and border troops intercepted them. Thai aircraft also attacked the warship, hitting it with three rounds. The French troops were driven out of Thai territory, and the warship has returned. Another report states that the landed French troops were repelled on the northeast bank of the Mekong River, suffering heavy casualties. French sources say that several villages on the French border have been destroyed by machine gun fire. There may still be hope for a peaceful resolution of the current dispute between Thailand and Vietnam. The Thai Supreme Command has issued a warning, demanding that the French immediately cease their border incursions, or they will face a fierce retaliation. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: The Central Daily News reported that the outbreak of war between Vietnam and Thailand may indicate Japan's determination to proceed with its southern strategy. It is noteworthy that Thailand resorted to force only after negotiations between Japan and the Dutch East Indies in Batavia were suspended. Japan is currently using Thailand to fulfill its desire to completely occupy Vietnam as a base for its southward expansion. At the same time, if the Dutch East Indies refuses to comply, Japan will take military action against them. It is reported that as a result of negotiations between Vichy and Tokyo, Japan obtained the French government's consent to establish an air base in Saigon. The newspaper believes that the conflict between Vietnam and Thailand is closely related to the situation in the Dutch East Indies. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: According to semi-official Japanese sources, French authorities in Hanoi announced today that all telegraph and telephone communications between Thailand and Vietnam have been interrupted, except for those via Singapore. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>Hanoi: Mr. Hermann, a Dutch journalist for the Handelsblad newspaper of the Dutch East Indies, was shot and killed by a Thai soldier last night. Mr. Hermann was sitting in a guardhouse at the border town of Poipet (phonetic translation) at 6:30 PM when he was hit by a bullet. It is believed that the bullet was fired by a Thai soldier who had entered Vietnam. (United Press, 4th)</p>
<p>Hanoi: The government here, in an effort to promote a peaceful resolution to the Thai-Vietnamese dispute, has now agreed to postpone the implementation of retaliatory measures. It also stated that the border was very quiet last night. (United Press, 4th)</p>
<p>Vichy: An official statement here said that Thai aircraft had repeatedly bombed Thakhek and Savannakhet in the previous four days, causing heavy casualties. The statement denied reports that Thai forces had occupied Aranyaprathet, that French aircraft had bombed Thai territory, and that French aircraft had been shot down. The statement said that the Thai army has 100,000 men, including 22 infantry divisions, four cavalry divisions, 80 tanks, and several American aircraft. It also estimated that the Thai navy is stronger than the French Far East Fleet. (United Press, 4th)</p>
<p>Bangkok: The Thai Supreme Command stated that on Monday, Thai anti-aircraft artillery fired on a French armored transport ship on the Mekong River, scoring multiple hits. The ship was attempting to land soldiers on the Thai bank of the Mekong River. It also stated that French long-range artillery had shelled the Thai bank of the Mekong River. A police station and a tower near the northern Thai border city of Tha Pa Klang (phonetic translation) were hit. Thai artillery returned fire, and Thai aircraft strafed the French long-range artillery with machine guns. There were no Thai casualties, and French casualties are unknown. Radio Saigon also broadcast a message in Thai yesterday, warning Vietnam not to send troops to the border to confront Thai actions. (United Press, 4th)</p>

<h3>Guangdong Province Intensifies Land Reclamation Efforts</h3>
<p>Shaoguan: The Guangdong Provincial Steering Committee, in order to reclaim wasteland, increase production, and provide relief to righteous people, has planned to carry out large-scale land reclamation. To determine the amount of wasteland in each county, it has first launched an investigation to develop the land according to actual conditions and needs. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Regarding the Wang Jingwei-Japan Treaty: A Glimpse of British Newspaper Commentary - It Cannot Influence the Situation in the Far East, Nor Can It Change the Policies of the Powers</h3>
<p>London: Various newspapers here have commented on the signing of the Wang-Japan treaty. The London Times published an analysis on Monday, examining the wording and implied conditions of the Wang-Japan treaty. It concluded that Japan's recognition of the "Wang organization" cannot influence the situation in the Far East, nor can it affect the established policies and attitudes of the powers. The Axis countries are naturally cheering and praising it, and the Vichy government has no choice but to tacitly acknowledge it. However, at this moment, the United States is providing China with another $50 million in aid. The British policy remains steadfast, and the Soviet Union maintains its freedom of action. Japan's recognition of Wang Jingwei cannot depress the Chinese government because of the recent large-scale withdrawal of Japanese troops from South China and the failure of the Japanese army to maintain order in North and Central China. The Chinese government will not become more worried because of the Wang-Japan treaty. Japan's recognition of the "Wang organization" does not reduce Japan's military responsibilities. Japan still needs to conscript hundreds of thousands of soldiers every year to protect the survival of its regime. The newspaper also prominently published a dispatch from Washington stating that the United States should announce a loan at this time, which would be the first major diplomatic action since President Roosevelt's election and would be of great significance to the Japanese government and its new ambassador, Nomura. Nomura's appointment as the new ambassador clearly aims to improve Japanese-American relations. Tokyo's attempt to get the United States to accept the fait accompli as a basis for negotiations has never come close to realization since the United States abolished the commercial treaty. Secretary of State Hull's statement on the 30th of last month that the Chongqing government has the support of the vast majority of the Chinese people is indeed true. The newspaper's Tokyo dispatch analyzes the nature of the Wang-Japan "treaty." Between the lines, it specifically clarifies that this document cannot change the current state of the war, stating that as long as the Chinese government continues to fight, Japan will never achieve the objective conditions it requires. A spokesman for the Japanese Foreign Ministry explicitly stated that this condition will only be achieved when Japan acknowledges that anti-Japanese sentiment has been eradicated. In addition, the News Chronicle's brief and clear editorial stated that the Wang-Japan "treaty" has suffered two major blows. If Japan still hopes that China will stop the war, admit defeat, and accept the "new order," then this hope has quickly become a pipe dream. The United States' loan to China shows the United States' determination to prevent Japan from realizing its ambitions in the Far East. China continues to fight, holding a crucial front line on the world's battlefield. The Manchester Guardian also has a penetrating editorial discussing this matter, stating that "'Good Neighborliness and Economic Cooperation' means that China accepts Japan's political and economic sanctions. Japan's stationing of troops in China under the pretext of anti-communism is extremely important. Japan is trying to expel the rights and interests of various countries in China. If China does not submit, Japan cannot advance south. If Japan withdraws from China without suffering damage, it can turn to advance south. After advancing south, it will advance north again."

<h3>Tianjin British Municipal Council Establishes Japanese Advisor</h3>
<p>Tianjin: The Tianjin British Concession Municipal Council has newly established the position of Japanese Affairs Advisor. It was announced today that Japanese national Nakagawa has been appointed to the position. (4th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>Food Prices in Peiping Triple</h3>
<p>Peiping: Since the assassination of a Japanese lieutenant colonel here on November 29th, food prices in Peiping have tripled because the Japanese closed the city gates to search for the assassins. The Japanese are still conducting searches, but so far have found nothing. (4th United Press dispatch)</p>
<h3>Greek Cargo Ship Sends SOS Signal</h3>
<p>Hong Kong: The tugboat "Henry Keswick" is currently en route to assist the cargo ship "Greek Merchant," which was en route from Hong Kong to Hongji, Vietnam, on Sunday. The radio station received a distress signal from this cargo ship last night, stating that it had run aground and was damaged north of Hainan Island at 20.14 degrees north latitude and 110.58 degrees east longitude, and urgently needed rescue. Although the radio company stated that the signal received was sent by a British cargo ship, it is generally believed that it must be the cargo ship "Greek Merchant," owned by the Greek Yannoulatos, with a registered tonnage of 1,052 tons.

<h3>Yunnan Education Announces Recent Status of Education Throughout the Province (Part 2)</h3>
<p>Elementary Education</p>
<p>The goal of elementary education is to implement the basic national education, that is, compulsory education and preparatory education for further education. The facilities for elementary education in this province, the important statistics of elementary education in the province last year, (1) Number of schools: 15,579, including 56 kindergartens, 12,618 four-year primary schools, 422 six-year complete primary schools, 102 three-year simple primary schools, and 2,382 one-year short-term primary schools. (2) Number of classes: 25,339. (3) Children: 774,816, including 621,815 boys and 53,001 girls (accounting for one-quarter of the total). (4) Number of faculty and staff: 29,734 (including 27,425 men and 2,309 women). (5) Expenditure: 3,271,918 yuan, calculated as 4.02 yuan per child per year for education, an average of 26 students per teacher, and an average salary of 104.52 yuan for each primary school teacher, with an average income of 8.71 yuan. Rural primary schools still have some support in terms of firewood and rice, but the treatment of primary school teachers is indeed too meager. Beginning this year, the Department promulgated the compulsory education plan for the entire province. The main point is to promote compulsory education on the one hand and improve elementary education on the other. The main methods are: the units implementing compulsory education, the establishment of short-term primary schools in villages and towns, four-year primary schools, and then the establishment of six-year complete primary schools in districts, with special attention to the establishment of senior departments. Furthermore, county towns should establish large-scale, high-quality six-year complete primary schools, purely for the purpose of preparing for further education, and kindergartens should be established simultaneously, with the principle of being able to separate boys' and girls' schools. The number of school-age children in the province is 1,645,985, accounting for more than one-seventh of the province's population of 11,954,802. The number of students currently enrolled is 774,816, accounting for more than 45 percent of school-age children, which is less than half of the number who should be enrolled. In recent years, short-term primary schools that do not cost manpower or financial resources have been promoted as much as possible, and the Provincial Department has established experimental short-term schools in various counties. The intention is to quickly complete the national coverage of popular education. The national completion of popular education is only six years, so we must catch up quickly. The counties and districts along the northwestern, southwestern, and southern borders of this province are the distribution areas of Tusi Yi people. Because their language, customs, and habits are very different from those in the interior, the local educational and cultural standards are far behind those in the interior. Previously, the Education Department held border education in border counties, establishing one provincial primary school in each county. There are currently 34 border provincial primary schools, with 154 classes and 7,930 students, of which Yi students account for four-tenths.</p>
<p>Social Education</p>
<p>The facilities and methods of social education and people's education can be broadly divided into two types: social type and school type. Social-type undertakings include 5 provincial-level people's education centers, 51 county-level people's education centers, 1 provincial-level library, more than 10 county-level libraries, 2 provincial-level public sports fields, 36 sudden-establishment sports fields, 5 provincial-level film and broadcasting patrol education teams, and 2 provincial-level drama, music, and song patrol education teams. School-type undertakings mainly focus on adult education that popularizes literacy training to eliminate illiteracy and popularizes civic training to cultivate citizens. Its facilities can be further divided into peacetime people's education and wartime people's education. Wartime people's education is promoted in Kunming City and County, with significant results. It is estimated that by the end of this year, 70,000 illiterate people can be eliminated, with an average education cost of 1.60 yuan per person. It is now planned to designate 29 counties, including Chenggong, to implement wartime people's education, with a time limit of one year to eliminate illiteracy for 1 million people in three years, and 3 million people. All are young and strong backbones of the province aged 17 to 35. If it can be done, the impact will be significant. (The End)</p>

<h3>Food: Speculative Rice Merchants Get Their Wish - Kunshan Japonica Rice at 106 Yuan - More Than 10,000 Bags of Foreign Rice Arrive at the Source - Yesterday's Selling Price Saw a Slight Rebound in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>After the rice market experienced consecutive days of skyrocketing prices, the Rice Industry Association announced that from today onwards, all market purchases must be based on the morning market price on the 3rd and must not be exceeded. If there are any violations of private secret transactions, once verified, they will be reported to the authorities for strict punishment. The rice market yesterday did not open until nearly noon. Most speculative large households were still watching and not thinking of selling. Only some small scattered households, due to tight funds and inability to hold on, slightly released their holdings. However, the buying households were indifferent in this situation. With the sales market cleared, the sellers had to lower their prices to solicit buyers. In addition, because new transactions continued to be officially announced and there were direct orders, most speculators became timid and sought to sell. Therefore, the market weakened in the middle of the day, and the market rebounded by two or three yuan in the afternoon. After the sellers became more active in the afternoon, Chinese and foreign merchants contacted them by telegram. The floating households made a lot of profits and cut their positions, and the market rebounded by one yuan. As a result, the spot price rebounded by two or three yuan, and the futures price rebounded by three or four yuan. In addition to the 1,500 tons of small twisted rice from Taihe Foreign Bank in January at a price of 78 yuan, other new transactions have not been announced. The returned goods included Saigon spot goods opened at 105 yuan, December at 96.5 yuan to 95 yuan, No. 2 at 96 yuan to 95.5 yuan, and small twisted rice at 86 or 7 yuan. The holders competed to sell, so the returned transactions increased to more than 1,000 tons. The actual sales of spot goods were sluggish, and the prices were speculative. Only five or six thousand bags were traded.</p>
<p>Since the announcement of the cut-off of thick and thin Japonica national rice from outside the border, the price of all market goods has risen day by day. On the morning before yesterday, the price was 98 yuan per picul. In the afternoon, it was rumored that an astonishingly high price was opened. The original packaged Kunshan Japonica rice crossed the 100-yuan mark and reached 104 yuan. Yesterday, the price continued to rise in this state, rising by another two yuan. It was heard that the original packaged Kunshan Japonica rice opened at the highest peak of 106.5 yuan, and the price of a picul was also 100 yuan. The special original packaged thin rice was 102 yuan to 100 yuan, and the price of a picul was 97 or 8 yuan. Du Yangjian still had no market. This year's New Year, the so-called rice price of 100 yuan per picul, speculative rice merchants rely on external forces to get their wish, and even exceed it.</p>
<p>Due to the foreign glutinous rice being restricted by the foreign rice, the sales of national glutinous rice have also turned sluggish. However, the price has not changed because the owners are unwilling to relax due to the limited chips. The price of Yili cargo is still 95 yuan, Hong Kong white is 86 yuan to 84 yuan, and glutinous rice is 75 yuan to 72.5 yuan.</p>
<p>Foreign rice arrived in Shanghai one after another. Yesterday, Yihai Foreign Bank's Fusheng wheel brought 1,016 bags from Hong Kong, and Taikoo Company's Jinan wheel also brought 9,992 bags from Hong Kong. The two wheels arrived in port yesterday morning and berthed at the Roosevelt Wharf and the company's wharf on the Bund of the French Concession to unload foreign rice. Foreign rice is constantly arriving, and the price of rice continues to rise sharply. The livelihood of ordinary people is worrying. I don't know when it will be leveled. (Zu)</p>
<h3>Foreign Flour Continues to Rise</h3>
<p>Flour: Yesterday's foreign flour market was short of domestic flour, and those who needed it paid attention to foreign flour. There were also guest gangs transshipping goods, and the sales market became more widespread. The whole market sold more than 10,000 bags of Australian foreign flour, such as Bell Tower, Flower Bird, and Spleen. The spot price was 22.2 yuan to 20 yuan, and the road cargo also reached the 20-yuan mark. The rising trend can be said to be rapid. However, it is heard that the price of rice has rebounded, and people's minds have gradually become stable. It is also heard that a ship of foreign flour will arrive around the 10th of this month, with a quota of more than 200,000 bags. At that time, the market may be able to suppress the price. As for the Chinese factory's flour, the wholesale volume is still more than 8,000 bags, and the factory price is still 18 yuan.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday's transaction still had no special development. The price of wheat stored in the concession warehouses must be 29 yuan, and the Chinese factory has not accepted it for the time being. However, it is rumored that Sanxin Factory has again received more than 30,000 bags of futures, priced at 28 yuan, all for delivery in the second half of December, and will be delivered one after another. As for those received at the stores, the number is only two or three hundred bags.</p>
<h3>Securities: Foreign Debt Soars, Domestic Debt Also Advances</h3>
<p>London, 3rd (Tuesday) Dispatch: Today's listed prices for Chinese foreign debt and Far East British company stocks show strong market sentiment for Chinese foreign debt, with most bonds rising by one pound. Previous British-German loans (British issue) were at 38.5 pounds, Sino-French-American gold at 41 to 46 pounds, British-French loans (British issue) at 43 pounds, Crisp at 20 pounds, Reorganization Loan (British issue) at 31 pounds, and Vickers Airplane Loan at 10 pounds. Subsequent railway bonds: Beining at 47 pounds, Daowei at 16 pounds, Huguang (non-German issue) and Jinghu at 15 pounds, Longhai at 14 pounds, Huguang (German issue) and Jinpu subsequent issues at 13 pounds each, and Guangjiu at 12 pounds. Far Eastern stocks: bank stocks fluctuated slightly. Mercantile Bank shares rose 2 shillings 6 pence to 7 pounds 7 shillings 6 pence. Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) London-registered shares rose one pound to 70 pounds, while Hong Kong-registered shares fell three pounds to 70 pounds. There were offers but no buyers; the rest remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Securities Grey Market: Yesterday's market gradually showed opportunity. After a multi-day stalemate between bulls and bears, the bulls still held the upper hand. The environment showed gradual and significant changes. Following the American loan, there are rumors of large loans from other friendly nations. Although still in the rumor stage, realization is not far off. Maintaining the legal tender has gradually gained strength, and it is rumored that the government is considering a considerable extension of commercial exchange rates. Government bonds have thus entered a period of resurgence, with investment gradually increasing and market prices rising daily. The future should see new developments. Yesterday morning, No. 16 first bought Huai Bingzhong (淮丙種), raising the price by three or four jiao. Hongda Huaiwei (鴻大淮胃) was also extremely strong. Others, such as Yitai (怡泰), Tongda (同大), Tongkang (同康), Lianhe (聯和), and Lianyi (聯益), also saw considerable covering or new positions. The sluggish market price thus showed some vitality. In the afternoon, the news was very strong, all favoring the bulls. Hongda and others continued to buy, and Shunchang (順昌), Tongshun (同順), and Changkang (長康) all showed demand. Lianyi and Lianhe offered some supply. Bingbo (丙伯) once reached four yuan. Yitai resurfaced, and Dechang (德昌) and Runli (潤利) also had some selling, falling back a jiao or two. Xie Kang (協康), Sheng Da (生大), Sheng Chang (牲昶), and No. 64 came to collect Bing (丙), and the price rose again. The situation was firm and brisk, and the market's purchasing power was extremely strong. The result was a unanimous rebound of two or three jiao to seven jiao. The total transaction volume was estimated at two million yuan. A brief summary table is listed below:</p>
<p>Stock Transactions: 200 shares of Rengyuan Land Company were transacted at a price of 26.5 yuan.</p>
<p>Public Industry Exchange Stock Market: The opening was still weak, but soon recovered to a stable position. Both bulls and bears saw little large-scale trading. Jardine Matheson once fell to 82.5 yuan, but closed back at 84 yuan. There is reason to believe that the new shares of Shanghai Woolen Company, which open for subscription tomorrow, will be heavily oversubscribed. This point may be sufficient to improve the general market situation in the future. Rubber stocks were quiet and stable.</p>
<p>Finance: Foreign Exchange Sellers Follow Each Other, Rumors of Extending the Chongqing Commercial Exchange Rate, Generally Believed Unrealizable at This Time</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw HSBC's listed prices unchanged. The grey market for British and American exchange rates remained on a downward trend, with selling pressure continuous, especially with Hong Kong Electric (港電) forcefully yielding ground. Midway, there were also rumors that the Chongqing commercial exchange rate would be changed to 6 pence for British exchange and 10 yuan for American exchange, a larger extension than previous rumors. However, it is generally believed that this will not be realized, because if it were realized, it would be as Suma, spokesman for the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said: "This American loan may indirectly benefit Japanese commerce in China." Therefore, if the government does not have strong management methods for the Shanghai exchange market, forcibly maintaining foreign exchange and then extending it would not be a blessing for China. Therefore, to the greatest extent possible, raising the foreign exchange level within the free China region might be a possibility, but even then, implementing it immediately without preparation would inevitably affect the Shanghai market. However, the future of legal tender is ultimately optimistic, so there will eventually be a day when foreign exchange is extended, but under the current circumstances, it is not yet the time. The Chongqing telegram from the previous day mentioned a certain powerful nation providing economic assistance to China, a loan for purchasing tungsten and tin. Yesterday, there were rumors of a British loan and a Soviet loan to China. As a result, people in the foreign exchange market were excited yesterday, and speculators sold in droves. The hardest American exchange opened at 6 yuan, with considerable transactions. At the midday closing price, British gold was 3 pence 78125, and American exchange was 5 yuan 96875. In the afternoon, Wednesday saw no market. Compared to the previous day, British and American exchange rates were harder by 0.015625 and 0.03125 respectively. Futures were in line with spot prices.</p>
<h3>Speculative Hong Kong Traders All Sold</h3>
<p>In the early morning, London large bars, recent forward prices rebounded by 0.0625, New York silver prices were stable, London raw gold was stagnant, exchange rates for British against American unchanged, against Shanghai rising by 0.03125, American against British unchanged, against Shanghai stable, no market for against French exchange. Central listed prices for various exchanges remained as before. Bank morning opening spot selling price: British gold 3 pence 765625, American exchange 5 yuan 9375, the same as the previous day's closing price. At the opening, Zhengjin (正金) once first bought American exchange for the current month at 5 yuan 9375 from foreign banks. Before long, telegrams came to fill in. Zhengjin then sold the same month's American exchange, calculated from advantageous and certain American banks entering at 5 yuan 9375 to 96875. HSBC listed prices were revealed, unanimously unchanged. The silver equalization tax was also announced as stable. Afterward, there was a time when the Feihu (費戶) suspended, and the tax collection softened, but soon the China Bank (華銀行) did spot transactions in shillings, cheap at 3 pence 796875. At that time, speculators forcefully sold, Hong Kong Electric continued to sell, and prices broke down. American exchange reached the 6 yuan mark. It is estimated that American banks and foreign banks absorbed their American exchange for the current month at 6 yuan. Midday closing prices were still stable, with both spot and near-term British gold reported at 3 pence 78125, and American exchange at 5 yuan 96875. Compared to the previous day's spot prices, near-term British rose by 0.015625, and American hardened by 0.03125. Next month's British and American softened by 0.03125 and 0.0625 respectively.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong British Stable, American Soft</h3>
<p>Hong Kong, 4th (Wednesday) Dispatch: This morning, the exchange market closed stable. British exchange spot and Japanese exchange spot were neither honored nor disgraced. British exchange forward prices have not yet opened. American exchange spot hardened by 0.0625, to 23.5 yuan. Shanghai exchange spot fell by 2 yuan, to 394 yuan (yesterday's closing was 396 yuan). Stabilized at 10:48. American exchange spot continued to soften by 0.0625, to 23.5625 yuan. Stabilized at 11:30. All exchange rates showed no change. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon.</p>
<h3>Tianjin Exchange Rates Also Rise</h3>
<p>Tianjin, 4th (Wednesday) Dispatch: This morning, the Haishi (海市) market opened, first reporting London telegraphic transfer hardened by 0.1875, to 4 pence 1875. New York telegraphic transfer rose by 2.25, to 6 yuan 53125. Shanghai exchange fell by 2.5 yuan, to 89.5 yuan. "Lianchao (聯鈔)" grey market cheapened by 2.25 yuan, to 89 yuan.</p>
<h3>Amidst a Wave of Bearish Sentiment, Gold Prices Plunge</h3>
<p>Yesterday's grey market for gold saw an increasingly sharp decline. The price had already entered the 5,800 yuan range. There were rumors of Chongqing commercial listed prices being extended, and a certain head company in western Shanghai came to sell. People's hearts were greatly exhausted. The opening was as low as 5,780 yuan, and gold shops continued to sell for 30 yuan. Thereafter, there was an unexpected rise. Silver shops and money houses tended to cover short positions of about 2,000 taels, which saw a rise to 5,820 yuan. Before long, negative rumors suddenly arose, and the foreign exchange softening trend suddenly moved. Moreover, the Minhao (岷號) gang and the substituting draft merchants and the bull companies came to sell, resulting in a retreat to 5,725 yuan, and finally to 5,730 yuan, 85 yuan less. After the close, it retreated again to 5,720 yuan with no buyers. Half-day transactions totaled 5,000 several hundred taels. There was no market in the afternoon on Wednesday. Cash was 10 yuan lower than forward prices. Gold shops and silver shops offered dozens of taels to money houses, and two silver shops did swaps of 60 taels each. The buyer posted 12 yuan to the seller, and jewelry was listed for 10 yuan less, to 590 yuan. Customs gold and other items were stable.</p>
<h3>Raw Gold Falls 83 Yuan</h3>
<p>The morning started extremely sluggish, with buying interest depressed. A gold shop first sold 20 taels to a silver shop at 5,780 yuan, opening 30 or so yuan lower than the previous day. Gold and silver shops sold together, falling another 30 yuan, with silver shops doing 30 taels at 5,750 yuan. At this time, the foreign exchange rose slowly, and scattered households saw the cheapness and rushed to buy, causing a recovery. The securities gang entered 20 taels into the silver shop at 5,800 yuan. Instantly, the gold shop wanted to sell, pushing down another 20 yuan, with the Yuhao (余號) offering 30 taels to the money exchange at 5,780 yuan. Relying on silver shops and money exchange suddenly buying up, it rose out of the 800 yuan mark, with the securities gang entering 20 taels into the gold shop, rising to 5,820 yuan. Unexpectedly, the good times did not last, and a grand selling trend arose. The foreign exchange reported softening, and the American exchange reached 6 yuan. Gold and silver shops all sold, falling miserably to 5,725 yuan, with the Jin gang (金　) selling 10 taels to the silver shop. As a result, silver shops did 30 taels at 5,730 yuan. There was no market in the afternoon on Wednesday, 83 yuan lower than the day before yesterday. Half-day trading fell 90 yuan. The wood-plate gold selling price of cash gold shops was more than 10 yuan higher than raw gold, and the purchase price was 30 yuan lower.

<p>Next Year's Bank Holiday Schedule</p>
<p>The holiday schedule for member banks of the Shanghai Banking Association in the Republic of China Year 30 has been determined and is copied below:</p>
<p>Uneven Supply and Demand for Foreign Currencies</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw erratic raw gold prices, which eventually continued to fall. British and American gold pounds also fell by one yuan each. The supply and demand for British gold notes were even, and market prices stood firm. American gold notes fluctuated erratically, initially retreating to 16 yuan 7 jiao 2 fen, then gradually rising to 8 jiao called, then retreating to 5 jiao 7 fen, and finally to 16 yuan 6 jiao 2 fen, 1 jiao 8 fen lower than the previous day. Hong Kong notes rose slightly due to infrequent demand. Japanese gold notes rose and then fell back, with the evening market at 1 yuan 5 jiao 3 fen. Korean notes still saw strong demand, with the evening market as high as 1 yuan 2 jiao 1 fen.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Gold Spear Gang Sells in Large Quantities, Yarn Prices Plunge</h3>
<p>The yarn market entered another period of fluctuation, but actual trading was still considered good. The Hong Kong gang was remarkably strong for 32-count single yarn, so in addition to the 32-count dog girl (犬女) rising by 30 yuan alone, the industry's morale was boosted. However, the general gold gang held speculative ideas. Because the price of gold was high, the yarn was weighed in jin (斤). If it was the opposite, it would come out at one time and five points. Rumors arose in the market, saying that the elimination was negative. The gold gang sold unanimously, suddenly falling by more than 10 yuan, and then slightly rebounding, but the industry still bought. Today, 2,510 pieces of yarn were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Shuangma (雙馬) opened in the morning with a harmonious and nourishing momentum, with the first plate price at 1,228 yuan. The market was still calm, and the price fell to 1,225 yuan. It was then heard that the Hong Kong gang continued to have good demand for existing yarn, and the selling price of 32-count ma danu (馬大女) jumped up by 20 to 30 yuan. At the same time, the foreign exchange rose and then shrunk slightly. Thus, buying momentum spread, and the general short sellers rushed to cover the market. The market opened more and more tightly, rising directly to 1,243 yuan, but some profitable bulls sold off, and the situation became flat again. It was close to 11:30 when it returned. After that, rumors suddenly arose that the foreign exchange would be extended, and in an instant, the gold gang also came to sell in large quantities. The situation changed rapidly, falling straight to 1,225 or 6 yuan, but a certain large yarn number continued to absorb it. The closing price returned to 1,129 yuan. The statistics for the number of bags traded in half a day were 5,450 bags. The price of 20-count Shuangma fell by 10 yuan. The amounts of each gang's mouth risk are listed below:</p>
<p>Same Industry 4,600 Hong Kong 570 Tianjin 270 Ningbo 10 Total 5,450</p>
<h3>Cotton Mill Stomach Slightly Active</h3>
<p>The current cotton situation is improving, because the sources of supply from all sides are not refreshing, and the procedures are extremely troublesome, and the risks are very large, so inventories are decreasing daily. Among the same industry, there is an eager search for Miterlin cotton. Therefore, the foundation of the cotton market is becoming increasingly solid.</p>
<p>In other news, the foreign cotton market price: The New York cotton market was firm from the start, first due to purchases by speculators, and then due to government reports of an increase in the amount of cotton used by domestic yarn mills in the United States. At the same time, the industry also purchased very enthusiastically. As a result, the closing price rose by six or seven pounds compared to the previous day. India stopped the market, and it is predicted that it will rise by more than one rupee.</p>
<p>Shanghai Port Foreign Cotton Trading: The factory side was more active, with quite a buying intention, but limited to spot goods, and the number was also limited, with 20-count raw materials being the majority. The Japanese factory force also slightly procured.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth Reaches a Tired Market</h3>
<p>The factory cloth market fell slightly yesterday and showed a rotating trend. It is rumored that a new Sino-Soviet loan will be established, foreign exchange will be extended, raw yarn will tend to fall, and cloth prices will be frustrated. White goods, coarse and fine cloths, and twills were mostly stable, with small amounts falling by 1 to 2 jiao. Bleached and dyed cloths were mixed. Heavy-sized and lower-end clean water bleached cloths and mercerized Prussian blue cloths were the most firm, due to higher demand in the market. Transactions on this street included 700+ pieces of raw cloth, bleached and dyed cloth, and flannel. The Guangdong-Hong Kong gang bought 300+ pieces of colored cloth, bleached cloth, coarse and fine cloth, and pongee. The Zhejiang-Fujian gang also bought 100+ pieces. The North Road Yantai gang bought 100+ pieces of coarse cloth and colored cloth.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: Because Eastern yarn continued to decline, the market was slightly soft. Dragon head fine cloth fell by 1 or 2 jiao per piece, and the closing price was 35 yuan 5 jiao. Mid-range fine cloth was still quite firm due to strong demand on this street, rising by 1 or 2 jiao. Si Jun (四君)干嗶嘰 opened in the morning at 1 yuan 09 fen 25, and the market returned to 1 yuan 08 fen 625.</p>
<p>Exports: Yesterday, 3,290 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong, and another 29 pieces were shipped to Singapore.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains: Stockpilers Sell, Oil Bean Rising Momentum Slightly Killed</h3>
<p>Yesterday's miscellaneous grain market situation was that various rumors such as gold falling and exchange softening were not true. It was also affected by the steep fall in rice prices, and speculative rice weevils were particularly disheartened, so the rising wind was suppressed. After a strict opening, most of the stockpilers inside and outside the industry stopped advancing and started to sell. Blind followers also mostly watched with their hands tied, so the market situation gradually turned flat. As a result, the spot price of raw soybean oil fell by about half a yuan, and futures saw a fall of yuan and a half. Soybeans also showed a flat and tired appearance. Tongshi (統市) sold a large amount of factory soybean oil, 300 dan, Yanqi (烟歧) soybean oil, 30 pieces, Jiaozhou (膠州) soybean oil, 50 pieces, Jiaozhou raw oil, 300 pieces, and another 100 pieces of new goods. Yantai raw oil, 50 pieces, Qingdao raw oil, 45 barrels, another 1,200 barrels in the lower half of December, and another 450 barrels in the February period. Tianjin Jinyuan (金元), 180 bags, Qingdao black soybeans, 100 bags.</p>
<h3>Coal: Second Batch of Hongji Coal Arrives, Totaling 9,000 Tons</h3>
<p>Since the 7,000 tons of Hongji white coal arrived a month ago, the second batch of orders arrived yesterday, transported by the French merchant shipping company "Arcade" (阿卡脫) wheel battle, including 3,000 tons of lump coal and 6,000 tons of coal chips. The vehicles were lined up at the Bund wharf, and Yi Tai Xing (義泰興) and Nanyang (南洋) banks were managing the sales. In addition to a portion to resolve old Zhaidan (老棧單), the majority can be supplied to the industry for dismantling and retail sales to customers.</p>

<h3>North-South Goods: Xinghua Longan Plunges</h3>
<p>Since the first batch of Xinghua longan arrived in dozens of dan, the source was difficult to transport out, resulting in an interruption for a long time. Recently, a batch continued to arrive, but miscellaneous road sources have been arriving continuously, and the market price has dropped a lot. Therefore, Xingyuan (興圓) is no exception. When a batch was opened yesterday, the degree of decline reached 40% strong, almost half the difference from the first market.</p>

<h3>The Shanghai Western Border Police Finally Established an Agreement. Once the So-Called "Approval" Procedures Are Completed, the "City Police" Will Enter the Bureau's Jurisdiction.</h3>
<p>According to an announcement by the Information Office of the Public Works Department, regarding the issue of police power in the Shanghai Western Border Road area, an agreement has been reached as a result of discussions between the Police Commissioner and Lu Ying. This agreement must still be approved by the Board of Directors of the Public Works Department and the "Shanghai Special Municipality," and it is expected to be officially sent to the Public Works Department by the "Municipal Government" soon.</p>
<p>Details Revealed - Increased Numbers</p>
<p>Regarding the "Joint Issue" of the Shanghai Western Border Road Construction Area, the final agreement was reached yesterday by Police Chief Superintendent Bao Wen and Municipal Police Bureau Chief Lu Ying. According to Bao, this agreement is a handwritten document that has been submitted to the Public Works Department for approval. He also stated that previously, Bao Wen and Lu Ying had directly negotiated various key points in the agreement, but the establishment of the agreement was through the exchange of official documents. Although the content of the agreement has not been released, authoritative sources say that the number of joint police powers will be greater than that previously stipulated by the Public Works Department and Chuan Xiao'an. It is also understood that the leader of the "Joint Police Powers" will be appointed by the "Municipal Government," and the deputy leader will be appointed by the Public Works Department, with these two acting as liaison officers between the two parties. The final agreement was reached after several months of negotiations between the two police authorities. The temporary agreement was signed a year ago, at which time the "City Police" immediately moved into the Border Road Construction Area, which was previously under the jurisdiction of the Public Concession Police Department.</p>
<p>Original Proposed Terms - Many Changes</p>
<p>The English-language "Da Mei Evening News" stated that a spokesperson for the Public Works Department officially disclosed this morning (4th) that the police chiefs of the Public Concession and the "City" have reached a final agreement today regarding the establishment of a joint police force in the Shanghai Western Border Road area. The full text will soon be submitted to the "City Government" for approval. Details of the agreement could not be officially announced this morning, but it is heard that Public Works Department Police Chief Bao Wen and "City Police Bureau Chief" Lu Ying have reached a satisfactory agreement after two months of discussion regarding the establishment of the West District Joint Police Force. It is expected that some changes will be made to the terms stipulated in the draft agreement concluded between the Public Concession authorities and Chuan Xiao'an. The biggest change is that the total number of police stations established in the Border Road area will be increased after the establishment of the Joint Police Force. In addition, those in charge believe that the head of the Joint Police Force will be a Chinese person appointed by the "Municipal Government," while the deputy commander will be appointed by the Public Concession authorities to serve as a liaison between the two parties.</p>
<h3>National Postal Transportation Network to Be Completed Within the Year - Restoring the Postal Transportation System</h3>
<p>In order to restore the postal transportation system, the Ministry of Transportation has decided to establish a postal transportation network throughout sixteen provinces and has issued an order to complete it by the end of the 29th year. At present, seven provinces, including Sichuan, Shaanxi, Guizhou, Guangxi, Gansu, Yunnan, and Hubei, have postal transportation routes that can transport goods, using means of transport such as back carriers, livestock, handcarts, and human labor. Currently, postal transportation from Kunming in the southwest and Lanzhou in the northwest can directly connect to Chongqing. The postal transportation networks in southeastern provinces such as Zhejiang, Guangdong, Fujian, Jiangxi, Anhui, Hunan, and Henan have been assigned personnel for deployment and are expected to be completed within the year.</p>
<h3>Moyler, H. O.</h3>
<p>Returned to Shanghai the Night Before Last, Took Leave of Absence Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>Customs Inspector General Moyler, H. O., left Shanghai for South China and the Philippines on the 9th of last month. He originally planned to return to Shanghai from Hong Kong via the Philippines at the end of last month, but because the Changxing Company's "Asian Empress" ship was requisitioned by the British Navy for military use on the 29th of last month, he changed to the Jardine Matheson Company's "Evershine" ship. He arrived in Shanghai the afternoon before yesterday and went to the Shanghai office of the Customs Inspectorate General as usual yesterday morning to work as usual.</p>
<h3>Wenzhou Compatriots Remit 50,000 Yuan to Relieve the Yongjia Rice Famine</h3>

It has already raised 50,000 yuan and remitted it to Wenzhou a few days ago.

<h3>Zhu Boquan - Now Safe</h3>
<p>Zhu Has Returned Home Safely Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>Zhu Boquan, Chairman of the Shanghai Clearing House, after being kidnapped on Yidingpan Road on the 29th of last month, sources say that Zhu returned home safely yesterday morning. However, details of his escape have not been ascertained.</p>
<p>Not Involving Money - Fear of Background</p>
<p>The "Continental News" reported that Shanghai banker Zhu Boquan has been kidnapped for many days and is still missing. Recently, a friend of Zhu stated that Zhu's family has not yet received notification from the kidnappers and has not been able to make contact with the kidnappers. Considering the kidnappers' long silence, it is feared that this crime has a political background and its motives are not in extorting ransom. According to reports, Zhu was kidnapped on his way to the office at the intersection of Yidingpan Road and Haig Road. After the incident, the banking industry in this city speculated about the case, suspecting that it was masterminded by political elements. Those people had once sought Zhu's services for a certain financial undertaking but were refused, so they resorted to kidnapping to force Zhu to comply. The Concession police authorities still claim to be unaware of the kidnapping case. It is said that if Zhu was kidnapped, it must have occurred outside the Concession area. It is also heard that Zhu's driver once returned to Zhu's residence at 600 Haig Road after the incident and then disappeared, and his whereabouts have not been ascertained.</p>
<h3>Large-Scale Fire at the Dajiao Japanese Airport Yesterday - Burning for Several Hours - Multiple Aircraft Destroyed</h3>
<p>A large fire suddenly broke out at the Dajiao Japanese Airport yesterday afternoon. It is said that multiple aircraft and many boxes of command flags were burned in the fire, resulting in huge losses. The fire burned for two or three hours before being extinguished. Afterwards, the Japanese military police, together with the "City Police," expelled all ships parked on the Suzhou River and MacKen Road Bridge and prohibited them from staying, which is said to be related to the negligence at the Dajiao Airport.</p>
<h3>Shanghai West Blockade - After Negotiations - The Situation Shows Some Relaxation - Allowed to Import Food But Must Be Inspected - House-to-House Searches Not Stopped Yesterday</h3>
<p>After three days of strict restrictions imposed by the Japanese side in the blockade zone next to Yidingpan Road, the situation gradually eased yesterday morning (4th). However, Japanese military police are still conducting house-to-house searches within the blockade zone. According to police disclosures, foreigners traveling along Yidingpan Road the night before were subjected to slight checks by Japanese military police. Chinese were allowed to pass without encountering major difficulties, with only those carrying packages being inspected. When an English-language "Da Mei Evening News" reporter asked various officials yesterday morning how long the Japanese blockade was expected to last, they were unable to say for sure.</p>
<p>Consular Group Negotiated - Situation Gradually Loosened</p>
<p>However, according to an official from a certain consulate, after the Japanese Consul General in Shanghai, Horiuchi, discussed the blockade with the Danish Consul General and Leader of the Consular Corps, Heer, close cooperation is now being provided. It is heard that during the discussion between the Danish and Japanese consuls, they amicably agreed that the Japanese authorities would only take the necessary measures against terrorists in the western district and would remove the blockade as soon as possible within the possible scope. Food, mail, and other essential items will also be allowed to be sent into the blockade zone, but must be inspected. Police sources said yesterday morning that the Japanese military police are currently conducting searches aimed at discovering "nests" of terrorists in winding alleys. However, the Japanese authorities remained silent on the blockade yesterday morning and did not disclose any information about arrests.</p>
<p>Most Foreigners - Enjoy Consular Jurisdiction</p>
<p>"Zi Lin Daily" reported that after a Japanese military policeman was assassinated on Daxilu last Saturday and Sunday, the Japanese authorities immediately imposed restrictions in the "bad land" area. According to news yesterday (3rd), after the Shanghai Consular Corps negotiated with the Japanese side, these restrictions were slightly relaxed, and foreigners felt relieved upon hearing the news. Heer, the leader of the consular corps, met with Japanese Consul General Horiuchi yesterday afternoon to exchange views on the western district blockade. It is heard that when Heer met Horiuchi, he expressed regret on behalf of the Consular Corps over the assassination of the Japanese, but stated that he hoped the blockade would be lifted as soon as possible within the possible scope. He also stated that foreigners in the area were greatly inconvenienced by the Japanese measures. Heer also requested that the Japanese side exercise as much caution as possible when searching foreigners and their cars, because most foreigners in the area enjoy consular jurisdiction and are not subject to searches by others.</p>
<p>More Than a Hundred Chinese - Have Been Arrested</p>
<p>In addition, Heer also requested that the Japanese side allow doctors, students, and food to enter and leave the blockade zone. Horiuchi replied that the Japanese side had no intention of harming foreigners in the area, but the Japanese side had no other way to take measures, so the Japanese side would maintain the blockade until it deemed it unnecessary to search. The Japanese search has been going on for three days. According to reliable sources, the Japanese side has arrested more than 100 Chinese during these three days. Regarding the search of foreigners' cars, Horiuchi expressed his apologies but said that it was necessary because the Japanese side knew that the assassins had hidden their weapons in cars parked by the roadside for smuggling, and the drivers in the cars were unaware of it. This is the reason for the Japanese search. As for the food problem for the Chinese in the blockade zone, it has been affected the most. It is heard that the rice in the area has been completely bought up. Eggs are sold for eight cents each, meat for three yuan per pound, and coal balls for only 30 cents per yuan.</p>
<p>Qianjia Lane - Was Once Open</p>
<p>According to an interview with a reporter from the "Pingming News Agency," the scope of the blockade by the Japanese side is from Difeng Road to Yidingpan Road in the east and from Daxilu to Yuyuan Road in the south. The residents in this area have lost their freedom. In the Qianjia Lane of Yuyuan Road, a gap had been opened in the broken walls demolished by the Japanese side, but by the afternoon, it was sealed off again. Only women and young children were allowed to enter and exit, and it was strictly forbidden to carry items out.</p>
<p>Chinese and Western Students - Can Now Enter and Exit</p>
<p>The Shanghai Western Border Road Labor Bureau Chinese Children's Public School and Daxilu Labor Bureau Primary School are also within the blockade line. However, for students to enter and exit, the Japanese side has opened a gap at the intersection of Yuyuan Road and Heping Road, allowing Chinese and foreign students to enter and exit. When most Western children go to school and leave school, they form groups and are led by teachers to prevent accidents. The gap is only used for students to enter and exit. Other Westerners, Japanese, and vehicles are restricted to one location at the corner of Daxilu and Difeng Road.</p>
<p>Food Problem - Is the Most Serious</p>
<p>For the residents trapped in the blockade zone, the most serious problem is the food supply. All food stores are unwilling to sell food to prevent a long-term blockade, making it impossible for residents to obtain food. Yesterday, hundreds of residents stood by the obstacles on Jing'an Temple Road and Heping Road, waiting for acquaintances to ask for food relief. According to a woman in the boundary, her husband works in the Concession. After the incident on the 30th of last month, he has not been able to return home. Because of this, the family's economy has suddenly become depleted, and the children are crying from hunger and cold, which is extremely painful.</p>
<p>Wangjia Lane Houses - Will Be Demolished</p>
<p>After Japanese Sergeant Sasaki was shot and killed in Wangjia Lane at Daxilu, the blockade on Yuyuan Road and Daxilu in Shanghai West was expanded and is still continuing. It is learned that the location of the incident was in Wangjia Lane. The Japanese side sent personnel to measure the area yesterday and erected red flags at the entrance of Wangjia Lane. It is reported that the Japanese side has decided to demolish the houses in the lane and widen it into a road, following the example of Qianjia Lane.</p>

<h3>Demands of Chinese Constables and Firefighters: Bureau Meeting for Discussion, Gathering This Afternoon for Comprehensive Planning, Expected Satisfactory Resolution After Research</h3>
<p>According to highly reliable sources, regarding the requests for improved treatment from Chinese constables and firefighters under the Public Works Department, the Public Works Department has decided to convene a meeting of the Personnel Committee this afternoon for a comprehensive discussion. Those requesting improved treatment are not limited to the aforementioned two departments; the matter concerns the entire financial situation, hence the need for thorough research.</p>
<p>Firefighter Demands: Expected Approval</p>
<p>According to foreign sources, the eight demands made by the 700 Chinese firefighters of the Public and Concession Fire Department were submitted to Fire Department Chief Captain Liddell on Tuesday (the 3rd). The Public Works Department is currently studying these demands. The Public Works Department believes that the demands are generally likely to be approved. As for the demands made by the Chinese constables, they have been submitted to the police department official in charge. At the same time, it is reported that Chinese Director Yu Qiaqing has expressed his willingness to donate 20,000 yuan to serve as the foundation for a Chinese constable mutual aid association, and to raise another 30,000 yuan to support the endeavor.</p>
<p>Chinese Constables Await Reply: Determined to Serve Peacefully</p>
<p>Another report states that regarding the issue of Chinese constables in the Public Concession requesting improved treatment, after the representatives of the Chinese constables submitted the various terms of their demands to the Deputy Chief Inspector of the Chinese Police Department the day before yesterday, the necessary steps are now being taken to handle the matter. It is expected that these terms will be submitted to Chief Executive Fessenden today, to be decided by the Board of Directors. At most, it will take one or two days, as the Chinese constables have requested that the authorities reply by Saturday afternoon. It is said that the Chinese and Western directors alike deeply desire an early resolution to this matter. If the demands do not have a major impact on the financial revenue and expenditure of the Public Works Department, it is highly likely that the Board of Directors will approve them. As for the Chinese constables, they are determined to work peacefully before receiving a reply, so as to ensure stable public order. Everything will be resolved through reasonable methods.</p>
<p>Public Association Meeting: Rice Industry Agrees</p>
<p>Immediately began the discussion. (1) Regarding the proposal for public granaries submitted by the Public Works Department for discussion, it was resolved that the proposal for public granaries submitted by the Public Works Department, with the aim of stabilizing rice prices and regulating food supply for the people, is well-intentioned and a good method. The industry associations of both public associations should agree with it. Regarding the subscription of 60,000 bags by the grain industry, they should also strive to take responsibility. However, as the industry's funds are limited and their business is not limited to rice alone, they rely on mutual support for capital turnover. Therefore, it is requested that the subscribed 60,000 bags can be freely bought and sold, and upon selling, they should immediately re-subscribe to replenish the amount. The above opinions will be represented by representatives to reply to the authorities, requesting approval in order to comply. At the same time, they will first advise the industry to continue to subscribe in large quantities as soon as possible, hoping that the rice price can be quickly stabilized. Starting from today, the number of subscriptions made will be registered with the association for calculation. (2) How to clear and stop the rice market in the afternoon was discussed, and it was resolved that the New Grain Industry Association should notify the brokers' association to copy all the brokers' lists to the association. All rice brokers will be refused entry into the Miscellaneous Grain Exchange, and their entry permits will be temporarily suspended. The remaining cases were omitted. The meeting adjourned at 5:15. In addition to posting the above resolutions in the Miscellaneous Grain Exchange Market today, the two associations also decided to send Chen Ziyi, Zhu Zixiang, and others to meet with the authorities tomorrow morning to report the various measures taken by the two associations. The ban on brokers entering the market will also be notified to the on-site supervisors and association members from today to ensure strict attention and completely eliminate rice and grain transactions in the market. The rice industry has also decided to continue to subscribe for 100,000 bags of foreign rice, and registration will begin immediately, which has been posted in rice shops and miscellaneous grain markets. The registration address is on the third floor of 15 Avenue Edward VII.</p>
<p>Assuming Responsibility for Granary Rice: Allocation of Quantities</p>
<p>Yu Qiaqing suggested that the concession authorities establish public granaries to store 200,000 bags of rice and grain, supplying the market to reassure the people and increase the spot goods. The 200,000 bags of stored rice should be replenished daily to prevent shortages. However, this matter is significant and relies on the cooperation of all sectors. Now, we explore the allocation of quantities for assuming responsibility for the stored rice as follows: (1) Enthusiastic people from all walks of life, 50,000 bags; (2) Silver and money industry, 50,000 bags; (3) Rice industry, 60,000 bags; (4) Other institutions and organizations, 40,000 bags. Each bag is paid for in advance by the subscribers at 32 yuan per bag, totaling 6.4 million national currency. The remaining half will be mortgaged and loaned by the silver and money industry to the respective subscribers after the rice arrives at the port, and it is stipulated that the goods should be shipped out within six months, and a considerable profit can be added when the goods are shipped out and sold. Now, Mr. Yu Qiaqing has personally sent the suggestion to the Public Works Department for review and handling.</p>
<p>Hongkou Stacked Rice: Already Available for Shipment</p>
<p>According to rice industry sources, the Japanese side approved the relocation of the rice stored in Hongkou to the concession for sale yesterday, but only allowed transportation by water, not by land. It is hoped that the authorities of the two concessions will raise this matter for negotiation. According to a reporter from the New Sound Society, the current quantity of rice flour stored in Hongkou has reached 100,000 bags, which can meet the needs of the citizens for two weeks. There are three stacks there, namely the Gonghexing Stack in Fair Road, the Shuntai Stack next to the Yeeson Shipyard, and the Huasheng Stack in Dent Road. The scope of these three stacks is very large.</p>
<p>Group Purchase of Rice: How to Expand</p>
<p>Yesterday, a letter from someone concerned about rice prices stated that the city of Shanghai has a population of about 4 million people, and 800,000 households of the bourgeoisie can be regarded as one-fifth of the total. The remaining three-quarters, or 3 million people (600,000 households), are mostly wage earners and those who struggle to make ends meet. Holding flat price sales cannot be popularized or sustained, and group purchases of rice can only be organized by employees of large companies and factories. Ordinary classes have no contact and lack organization. How can they seek group purchases? For the sake of the present, a long-term and fundamental solution should be sought for the vast majority of consumers who have no one to turn to for help. On behalf of the majority of consumers, a city-wide consumer cooperative group should be organized, advising the middle and lower classes to join together, raise funds to purchase rice directly, distribute it to members, and avoid exploitation by middlemen. All regulations should follow the principles of pure consumer cooperation. It may reduce difficulties if the municipal authorities come forward to negotiate. Some also advocate forming a food committee to investigate the amount of rice in Shanghai, as well as the owners, and limit the price to buy up all the rice within a specified period. If the owners fail to hand over the rice after the deadline, they should be confiscated and severely punished. It is also believed that the rice market is also responsible for the skyrocketing rice prices. If there is a rumor in the market, the owners will arbitrarily raise prices, and hoarders will rush to raise prices to collect rice. If all rice and grain are subject to prices set by the food committee, and all rights to buy and sell rice and grain are controlled by the committee, then there will be no need for the rice market to exist, and all kinds of malpractices can be eliminated.</p>
<p>Northeast Cold Wave: Will Not Affect Shanghai</p>
<p>Reports say that the weather in Northeast China is severe and it is snowing heavily. Checking the climate in Shanghai, it is often affected by the Siberian high pressure. The northeast cold wave is an attack by the high pressure. A reporter from the Datong News Agency inquired from the observatory that there is no strong high pressure occurring in Siberia, and the climate in this city will not be affected by it.</p>
<h3>Authorities and Rice Industry Discuss Establishing Public Granaries to Store Grain, Rice Industry Subscribes to 60,000 Bags of Granary Rice, But Requests Permission for Free Trading</h3>
<p>The Bean and Rice Industry Association and the Miscellaneous Grain and Oil Cake Industry Association held a temporary joint meeting of executive and supervisory committee members of the two industry associations at 3:00 p.m. yesterday at the association's location at 15 Avenue Edward VII. Zhu Ziyao, Xing Zhigang, Chen Shide, Jiang Hongbin, Yang Heqing, and others, totaling 15 people, were present. Chen Ziyi was elected as the temporary chairman. The chairman first stood up to report the purpose of the meeting, stating that the rice market is full of rumors, and people are uneasy. The rice price has risen by more than ten yuan per stone compared to before. The authorities care about the people's suffering and invited people to meet with Deputy Chief Executive He DeKui of the Public Works Department a few days ago to discuss the entire issue of food for the people. All agreed that the soaring rice price is related to the people's livelihood and social order. As a result of the discussion, the rice industry was instructed to continue to subscribe to 100,000 bags of foreign rice and 60,000 bags of public granary grain. The representatives promised to inform the industry and reply again. This measure by the authorities is admirable. It is hoped that everyone present will discuss it at length and jointly maintain food for the people. The committee members also expressed their opinions.</p>
<h3>Four Detained Foreign Vessels: Still Held and Not Released, Several Passengers Also Suffering Bad Luck, But Food Supply Not Expected to Be Lacking</h3>
<p>The Continental News reports that visitors from Wenzhou last week said that three German ships and one Chinese ship detained by the Japanese navy near Wenzhou last month are still held outside the port of Zhejiang Province. Several passengers from Southern Zhejiang to Shanghai on the ships are also being detained. The three German ships are the Elbhof of Reihher &amp; Co., the Monlenhof, and the Pelikan of Rohllin &amp; Co. The American ship is the Dasheng owned by Robert Dollar, chartered by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. The visitor from Wenzhou also said that there is no shortage of food supply for the detained ships, as the Japanese authorities allow the ship's cooks to go ashore to purchase supplies. However, the remaining people, including the foreign captains, are not allowed to move freely. The ship's radio room is guarded by Japanese sailors, and crew members are prohibited from communicating with Shanghai companies. According to shipping industry sources, the US Consulate authorities lodged a second protest with the Japanese Consul General last week regarding the detention of the Dasheng, and are still awaiting a reply.</p>

<h3>Villages Destroyed After Train Bombed on Shanghai-Nanjing Railway, Villagers' Wives and Children Crying, Too Horrific to Bear</h3>
<p>According to visitors from Suzhou, the Shanghai-Nanjing train was bombed by a landmine between Waitang and Guan Duli near Suzhou. The bodies of all the victims were piled up on the roadside for many days. Wild dogs devoured them fiercely, and the stench could be smelled for miles. Except for a few who were claimed by their families, the rest were covered in blood and flesh, and it was difficult to identify them. They were cremated by the Japanese in pits dug nearby. However, the Japanese were coffined and buried by Japanese personnel. The remaining injured passengers, now staying in Suzhou hospitals, still numbered around a hundred. The family members who went to inquire were almost all limited in number, and most of them were seriously injured. The train that was bombed and overturned on the roadside has been transported to Suzhou Station by workers hired by the Japanese. The Japanese army vented their anger on the villages near the scene of the accident. All the villages, large and small, have been burned to ashes. At this time of the year, when the north wind is whistling, all the innocent villagers who have no home to return to are crying, making it extremely tragic.</p>
<h3>Greater China Rubber Company Continues Strike, It is Feared That the Situation Will Not Subside for a While</h3>
<p>The Greater China First Rubber Company at 1102 Xujiahui Road, French Concession, has more than 1,500 male and female workers. Recently, due to the failure to request improved treatment from the factory, a strike was officially announced at 2:30 p.m. the day before yesterday (the 3rd). The second factory of the factory on Bailinan Road, now named Jiaotong Rubber Company, also has more than 500 male and female workers, who also participated at the same time. A total of more than 2,000 workers from the two factories are on strike. They are still waiting at the factory for representatives from both labor and management to resolve the issue. However, work in the two factories has been completely stopped. According to a reporter from the P'ing Ming News Agency, on the 20th of last month, the labor side, considering that life is difficult at present and the monthly wages are not enough to maintain a living, made a request to the management to improve treatment, and 11 articles were agreed upon. Now, because the management has not fulfilled the agreed articles, the labor side also believes that the previously agreed articles are not entirely satisfactory, so it intends to re-propose 17 new conditions to the management. It is feared that the situation will not subside for a while.</p>
<h3>Hongqiao Road Telephone Line Stolen Again</h3>
<p>The North China Daily News reports that, according to the Shanghai Telephone Company, a portion of the main telephone line in the Hongqiao area was stolen again yesterday morning. After the thieves stole the electric wire in the middle of Robegen Road and Hongqiao Road, all users in the area were blocked from making calls. The local police arrested a suspect, but the other person stole 90 feet, including 101 inches, of electric wire. This is the second theft in recent days. According to telephone company officials, repairs are now underway and can be restored that evening.</p>
<h3>Certification Rules for Overseas Chinese Industrial Products Promulgated by the Ministry of Economic Affairs</h3>

<h3>Coolidge Ship: Sailing to Little Luzon</h3>
<p>Originally Intended to Come to Shanghai, Temporary Change</p>
<p>The President Coolidge of the American President Lines, originally scheduled to sail from the United States to the Far East and arrive in Shanghai this Saturday (the 7th) before proceeding to Hong Kong and Little Luzon, the company announced yesterday that the ship had arrived in Kobe and would sail directly from Kobe to Little Luzon today. The ship will return from Little Luzon, passing through Hong Kong and Shanghai before returning to the United States. The reason for the temporary change in the itinerary of the ship, which originally sailed from the United States and did not come to Shanghai, but detoured directly to Little Luzon via Kobe, is not clear to the Shanghai office. The President Creford, originally scheduled to return from Little Luzon to Shanghai and the United States, was also scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 7th of this month. It is now postponed and is expected to arrive on the 9th and leave Shanghai on the 10th, returning to Los Angeles.</p>
<h3>London Evacuates Japanese Nationals: Passing Through Shanghai on the Kamakura Maru</h3>
<p>After the outbreak of the European War, Japanese nationals traveling in Europe evacuated to return home. Yesterday afternoon, the Kamakura Maru of the Nippon Yusen Kaisha arrived in Shanghai, docking at the Gonghexing Wharf in Hongkou, carrying a group of undecided evacuating male and female Japanese nationals from London. The ship is scheduled to sail back to Japan today.</p>
<h3>Donations for Poor Children's Winter Clothing</h3>
<p>More Than 10,000 Yuan Has Been Received, Various Elementary Schools Enthusiastically Contribute</p>
<p>The Shanghai Office of the China Children's Relief Association has received more than 10,000 yuan in donations and sold more than 500 new cotton-padded clothes since soliciting donations for winter clothing for poor children in the city. In addition to stepping up fundraising from all parties, the association is currently planning to rush to produce 2,000 sets of winter clothes first (the association's fundraising goal is 10,000 sets of winter clothes, each set costing six yuan). Once the donations reach a considerable amount, it will immediately invite merchants to undertake the production. It is hoped that all sectors will contribute as soon as possible so that poor children can get cotton clothes as soon as possible to survive the severe winter. Since the city's schools responded to the association's sponsored winter clothing campaign for refugee children, the students of various schools, under the leadership of teachers, have been able to actively promote and enthusiastically donate in the spirit of "children saving children," with excellent results, which is quite commendable. The association has received donations and clothing from Shengxin, Quanzhang, Jianming, Shangxintang, Huimin, Peiren, Shixue, Huanan, Wuben, Qingnian, Sino-Western First, Second, and other elementary schools, and the Baptist Joint Middle School. Other schools are still continuing to promote it.</p>
<h3>Russian Constable Dies in the Line of Duty: Funeral and Burial Yesterday</h3>
<p>On the 30th of last month, a robbery occurred on Avenue Edward VII. Russian constable No. 160 Xu Lianuof was seriously injured and died after exchanging gunfire with robbers. The funeral was held at 2:30 p.m. yesterday, departing from the morgue of Guangci Hospital and buried in Xujiahui Cemetery at 3:00 p.m. During the funeral, a Russian police officer led ten armed Russian constables to escort the coffin.

The deceased was 40 years old, unmarried, and had been serving in the French police station since 1937.</p>
<h3>Telephone Price Increase: Reconsideration Almost Impossible, The Company Will Implement it from the Day After Tomorrow, The Public Works Department Did Not Hold a Board Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Heavy burden, public sentiment is agitated, and the authorities are asked to reconsider and correct it. However, according to reporters' inquiries to relevant parties, the Public Works Department did not hold a board meeting yesterday. It is learned that reconsideration is almost impossible. Therefore, the new telephone price list will be implemented from the day after tomorrow (7th). A person in charge of a certain public group lamented that Shanghai citizens are facing high price pressures and have reached a serious stage. Speculation and manipulation by merchants is rampant, and public utilities are also frequently increasing prices. Alas, we ordinary people have no room to breathe. This is contrary to the purpose of maintaining public peace. Since telephones are relied upon by all industries, it is certainly impossible to dismantle them and not use them. All we can do is save by installing unnecessary telephones and not making unnecessary calls in order to save something if possible.</p>

<h3>Female Servant Turns Evil: Plots to Kill Mistress and Flee, Woman Stabbed to Death by Horse, Too Horrific to Behold, Stolen Valuable Clothing and Passbooks, etc.</h3>
<p>Wang Shen, a woman from Zhenhai, 46 years old, lived at No. 6 Avenue Petain, French Concession. Her husband had passed away, leaving behind a large amount of assets. She had a son named Zhaoyi, 25 years old, who worked at Hosin Trust Company at No. 119 Renji Road. He was married last year. Because Mrs. Wang was stubborn, disputes often arose between the mother and son. Her son rented a separate residence at No. 9, Lane 698, Route Paul Henry. Mrs. Wang's residence was a single-family shikumen, a landlord herself, living alone on one floor. The third floor was rented to a Cantonese woman, Chen Zhou. Mrs. Wang was</p>
<p>Eccentric in Nature</p>
<p>Therefore, the female servants she hired often did not stay long. Recently, she hired a female servant from Jiangbei, Cui Agui. Her husband was a coolie who wiped cars for a certain car company and often visited her. The morning before yesterday (the 3rd), Mrs. Wang ordered Agui to go to the market to buy a chicken, which cost four yuan. After Mrs. Wang brought the chicken back, she complained that the price of the chicken was too high. The master and servant started arguing, but soon calmed down. Chen, the tenant living on the third floor, did not see Mrs. Wang the next day at noon, and the female servant Agui was also</p>
<p>Nowhere to Be Found</p>
<p>The door was tightly closed. She thought that Mrs. Wang had gone out to visit relatives or shop and had not returned. Until dusk, there was no movement. Suspicion arose, so she peeped through the keyhole, but saw nothing. Chen opened the door and saw that the bed had been moved, and she found a huge cotton bag under the bed, tied with ropes.

<p>Mrs. Wang's Corpse</p>
<p>Lying there, wearing a cheongsam, with bare legs and feet, covered in six or seven horse wounds, and a horse stabbed into her neck, blood was dripping, too horrific to behold. She immediately reported it to the French police station, and then notified her son Zhaoyi to come, and then noticed that two gray back coats, a sea tiger velvet coat, a steel ring, and a bank passbook in the cabinet were all missing. It is learned that the husband of the female servant Agui had</p>

<p>The female servant was introduced by the female servant of No. 3's family. Then, police officers arrived and investigated everything, and brought all relevant persons, such as the three tenants, Chen, and the female servant of No. 3, to the police station for strict investigation, and at the same time investigated and arrested the fleeing female servant Agui and her husband. The body was sent to the autopsy room on Route Delastre.</p>
<h3>Slot Machine King: Hiding Without a Trace, Trial Opened Yesterday, Failed to Appear in Court, Confiscated Bail and Wanted</h3>
<p>The English-language Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury reports that the US Consular Court in China opened a trial this afternoon (the 4th) against Lai Ailai, the Shanghai Slot Machine King, for operating illegal gambling. US Consul Herrmick heard the testimony to prove that Lai Ailai was a US citizen. Unexpectedly, Lai Ailai had not appeared in court by 2:30 p.m. The Consul ordered Lai to be called three times, but no one answered, so he announced the confiscation of Lai's bail of 25,000 yuan and ordered the arrest of Lai. Lai Ailai admitted to the crime of operating illegal gambling during the previous trial, but the court must prove that he is a US citizen before a verdict can be made.</p>
<h3>Young Wu Xingfa Kidnapped Yesterday Morning; Father is Supervisor at Hotel Gramont; French Police Currently Trying to Rescue Him</h3>
<p>Wu Xingfa, from Wuxing, a sixteen-year-old youth, was kidnapped without a trace yesterday morning. His father, Wu Changlin (over sixty years old), from Hubei, is a supervisor at the Hotel Gramont on Route Lafayette and Rue Pichon in the French Concession, which is opened by Gramont, a French citizen who is a deputy general manager at the French Municipal Council. Wu Changlin is in charge of errands and store departures and lives at 7 Lane, Route Ratard, Latour Estate. At 5:10 AM yesterday morning, Xingfa took his private car No. 321 to the Ximo Road vegetable market to buy vegetables. Unexpectedly, when the car passed the entrance of No. 1325 Rue Lafayette and Rue Pichon, two kidnappers were stationed by the roadside, and two others in long robes stood in front of No. 1360, where a Xiang Sheng taxi, number unknown, was pre-parked. Seeing Wu's car approaching, the four bandits rushed up, drew their guns, and forbade anyone from shouting. They forcibly dragged Xingfa out of the car, forced him into the taxi, and sped away without a trace. Afterwards, the driver rushed back home and reported the kidnapping of his young master. Subsequently, the family went to the local Route Say Zoong police station to request an investigation. Police officers went to the scene to investigate and took a driver to the station for strict investigation. The whereabouts of the kidnapped hostage, Wu Xingfa, are still unknown. The French police are currently trying to rescue him.</p>

<h3>Two Construction Companies Dispute Over Purchase and Sale of Japanese Goods; Each Presented Their Case Yesterday, Court Ordered Judgment</h3>
<p>Yi Changtai Hong Construction Company owner Tong Zhihe, residing at No. 44 Tongchunfang, Baike Road, Public Concession, not only engages in construction business but also promotes Japanese cement for Japanese parties, profiting handsomely. Kang Zhaoji, owner of Yu Shengkang Ji Construction Company at No. 505 Henan Road, learned that Black Brand Japanese cement was inexpensive. Therefore, on October 16th and 22nd of this year, he ordered</p>
<p>Japanese cement</p>
<p>of 4,000 bags from Yi Changtai Hong Construction Company, at 9.6 yuan per bag, and paid a deposit of 11,600 yuan. Later, Yi Changtai Hong Construction Company failed to deliver the goods within the agreed period. Kang Zhaoji, owner of Yu Shengkang Ji Construction Company, recently hired lawyer Ma Shouhua to file a lawsuit in the First Special Court's Civil Division, requesting the court to order defendant Tong Zhihe, owner of Yi Changhong Construction Company, to return the deposit of 11,800 yuan and to order the defendant to</p>
<p>Compensate for Losses</p>
<p>estimated at 11,000 yuan in national currency. The case was heard yesterday by Judge Lu Dejun in the Civil Division of the First Court. Both parties commissioned lawyers to appear in court. First, the plaintiff's attorney stated the subject matter of the lawsuit and the defendant's breach of contract. Then, Zhang Yuji, the attorney representing defendant Tong Zhihe, stated that the defendant was engaged in the business of opening Yi Changtai Construction Company and that the plaintiff and defendant were in the same industry. During these extraordinary times, purchasing cement was</p>
<p>Relatively Difficult</p>
<p>The plaintiff knew that the defendant had access to buying Japanese cement, so he entrusted the defendant to buy it for him. Unexpectedly, after the contract was signed, the cement</p>
<p>Was Controlled by the Japanese Military</p>
<p>resulting in non-delivery. The plaintiff delivered a Korean Bank check for 9,000 yuan, which has not yet been used. The plaintiff wants to return the military funds and can come and take them at any time but is unwilling to bear the responsibility for compensating for losses. After reviewing the evidence and hearing the arguments of both parties, the court announced the conclusion of the hearing and scheduled the verdict for December 13th.</p>

<h3>"Illness"</h3>
<p>— Ning Jing</p>
<p>Now, whenever I hear that a young friend is sick, I can't help but doubt its authenticity. At the same time, a picture often seems to float before my eyes. There is a shadow flickering with bushy hair, big, bright eyes, and dark skin. I can also almost hear his low, urgent voice, resonating powerfully. The matter of his "illness" naturally surges into my heart, and it also naturally strengthens my belief: "China is saved; she has young people like this."</p>
<p>He is Xumin, short, a little fat, innocent, and enthusiastic. Once, he crashed his bicycle into a wall, and he screamed like a child. We laughed, and he blushed slightly and walked away. Not long after, we heard his loud, heroic singing again. When he was eager to get an answer, he would grab my shoulders, shake them gently, his eyes warming me, very seriously, "Tell me? Tell me?" urging me. But when he was unhappy or pondering, he became surprisingly quiet, like a secluded poet struggling with his verses, and in his round, big eyes, there seemed to be a light of melancholy.</p>
<p>Two years ago, we were classmates, but soon he transferred to another school, and our meetings gradually became less frequent. His home was far from my residence, and I had only been there once. The tall iron gates seemed out of proportion to the simplicity of his usual attire. When I pressed the doorbell, a dog barked, a small hole opened in the door, and an eye peered out. After inquiring, the doorman called inside, "Tell the young master, a friend has come." Then he ran out and warmly welcomed me in, but looking at the situation, I couldn't help but feel restrained. Thus, because there was nothing important, I didn't go there again later.</p>
<p>One afternoon last autumn, I ran into his younger brother, carrying his schoolbag, walking with some classmates. I called him over, wanting to get some news about his brother from him, but only heard the sentence:</p>
<p>"Him? He's been sick for two or three days." Before I could ask further, he ran off to catch up with his classmates. So I decided to visit him.</p>
<p>The next day before dusk, I went. After inquiring again, a maid led me to his door. Pushing open the door, I saw him staring at the ceiling in contemplation. Hearing the door creak, he turned and looked, then excitedly called out:</p>
<p>"Ha! Is that you? How did you come?" He sat up at the same time.</p>
<p>"Came to see you!" I replied. "Well! Talk while lying down, don't sit up." I glanced at him, beginning to have some doubts. His complexion was still the same, and because of his excitement, there was even some red showing through the darkness, his eyes shining, although his hair was disheveled, I couldn't see any traces of him being sick for two or three days.</p>
<p>But he smiled, instructed me to close the door, and then, like a child hiding in the woodshed telling a story, began to speak in a cautious and happy tone:</p>
<p>"You'll be surprised, I'm faking illness!"</p>
<p>"What?" I couldn't quite believe my ears.</p>
<p>He didn't care about me and continued, his face becoming very serious.</p>
<p>"I'm going to leave Shanghai, go to the rear. I don't want to stay here any longer!..." The door opened, and a maid brought in a cup of tea, placed it next to me, and said to him:</p>
<p>"Madam told you not to sit up, you'll catch a cold; talk less too." He casually replied and watched the maid leave, sighing to me:</p>
<p>"Mother is so good to me!..." But he didn't let the sadness of parting in his heart expand, so he changed the subject, "A lot of friends are leaving the day after tomorrow, and I've decided to go with them. The day before yesterday, I tested my parents' intentions, but they didn't approve and instead started guarding me closely. I have no choice but to fake illness. I'm sure I'll steal a chance to escape the day after tomorrow."</p>
<p>"For two days, I've only eaten porridge, and I'm really hungry." He smiled bitterly. "Actually, they would know as soon as they take my temperature, but they hired a Chinese medicine doctor, and that muddlehead even prescribed a prescription, haha!" It was getting late, and darkness invaded this small room. The exquisite furniture in the room stood vaguely, as if silently mourning the departure of its young master. And his voice was low and steady, waving in the air.</p>
<p>"Ning! Can you send a letter for me?" he asked me.</p>
<p>From beginning to end, I listened to him in silence, completely moved and intoxicated by him. Only at this moment did I wake up. I nodded, not responding, a thousand thoughts in my mind, very complex. I turned on the light for him, handed him paper and pen, and he immediately wrote the letter, sealed it, and handed it to me.</p>
<p>"Give it to Zhenzhi, that tall, thin guy with glasses... you may have seen him, please be sure to tell Zhenzhi that I will definitely come the day after tomorrow, he must wait for me." Then we shook hands tightly, his eyes glittering as if tears were about to flow out.</p>
<p>"Xumin, goodbye! Write letters in the future!" These were my last words.</p>
<p>Two days later, I went to his house again. The whole family was already in a mess. His younger brother saw me and immediately told me that he had left. Early in the morning, while the doorman took the dog out, he secretly left with a small suitcase. The door was still closed, and they still thought he was sleepless at night and wanted to sleep in a little longer in the morning. It was not until nine or ten o'clock that they discovered it and rushed to the dock, but the ship had already left. I didn't wait to hear the end before running back, my blood boiling.</p>
<p>After that, whenever a friend got sick, I couldn't help but suspect that they had the same illness as Xumin. I immediately rushed to their house, because this might also be my last meeting with them.</p>
<p>The Case of Hawthorne</p>
<h3>The Final Destination of the Dancing Queen</h3>
<p>— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter 12: Report and Explanation</p>
<p>I once said to him: "Our country is in a time of crisis, and future misfortunes can happen at any time and cannot be avoided. Young people are the lifeblood of the country and the pillars of the nation. How can you abandon yourself and throw yourself into the charming den, doing this act of suicide?" Hawthorne's words were of course more tactful, not as straightforward as mine. Yu Gantang looked ashamed and humiliated. I was secretly pleased, expecting that this young man still had the possibility of self-renewal, and the country could retain a bit more vitality. Because if a person feels ashamed of their mistakes, it shows that their sense of shame has not been completely extinguished. My hope for his self-renewal is pinned on this point.</p>
<p>When Hawthorne said goodbye to Ni Yushou, he had told him a few words about the wording in the newspaper. He truly left some room for Zhao Boxiong and would not drag his name into it, and Yu Gantang was also written as Yu Mou. Even the names I am recording now are fabricated. The names of several other people have also been changed.</p>
<p>We returned to our residence at 11:00 PM that night. The next day, Li Shouqi came to Shanghai, was interrogated by Ni Jinshou, and confirmed Hawthorne's speculation about Li Zhifan's motives. However, he definitely knew nothing about his father's murderous plan. Since this case was settled, Hawthorne did not advocate further involvement. Apart from recovering the four thousand five hundred and sixty yuan remitted by mail, Li Shouqi received no punishment at all. Regarding the property of the dancing queen, Li Shouqi of course dared not demand to inherit it. Lu Jiansheng did make a request to recover it. Hawthorne had tried his best to oppose it, and in the end, it, along with the reward he had given Hawthorne, was donated to charity.</p>
<p>Jiang Anna came to thank Hawthorne. Hawthorne refused her reward and gave her a few words of advice. She had a considerable realization due to the unfortunate end of her companion. The raincoat man in the black car was never found. Also, Lilans good friend, Bao Yumei, never fulfilled her promise. She never went to Lilans house. Whether Zhao Boxiong found her, we also did not know. However, after this case was disclosed, this Miss Bao Yumei suddenly left the dance floor and disappeared from then on. (186) (The End)</p>

<h3>About "The Story of Edison"</h3>
<p>— Xin Ying</p>
<p>Following "Young Tom Edison," "Edison, the Man" will soon be released at the Dahua Theater. Here's a brief overview of MGM's production of this film:</p>
<p>Story Content</p>
<p>"Edison, the Man"'s screenplay is based on a story by Tauries Carlyle and Hugo Butler, and unlike "Young Tom Edison," which depicted Edison's childhood, "Edison, the Man" depicts Edison's adult efforts to study science and invent various items, succeeding as a great inventor and being respected by the world.</p>
<p>Production Process</p>
<p>On this year's production schedule, MGM had already decided to film Edison's history into two films: "Young Tom Edison" and "Edison, the Man." So, at the beginning of the year, both films were started simultaneously. Although the production time was not very long, the research work was quite complete, and many shots were filmed in Edison's laboratory.</p>
<p>Cast</p>
<p>"Young Tom Edison" stars Mickey Rooney, and "Edison, the Man" stars Spencer Tracy. They are ideal roles. The female lead is played by Hedy Lamarr. One is a outstanding male star, and one is a famous and beautiful female star. Their joint performance in "Edison, the Man" naturally has extraordinary results. Other supporting roles include Rita Johnson, Lynne Overman, Charles Coburn, Gene Lockhart, Henry Travers, and more than ten others, all of whom are famous stars.</p>
<p>Photography Problems</p>
<p>"Edison, the Man" is directed by Clarence Brown, produced by John Considine Jr., and the photography is handled by the famous photographer Harold Rosson. According to this photographer afterwards, Hedy Lamarr's beauty was particularly successful when filmed. However, when filming in the laboratory, 90% of the shots used gas lamps, and the laboratory ceiling was only ten feet high, making it impossible for the camera to utilize angles, which became the biggest problem. It is difficult to achieve good results without someone with expertise in photography!</p>
<h3>"Confucius" Screening Imminent</h3>
<p>The Minhua Film Company's first contribution, "Confucius," directed by Fei Mu, has been rumored to be screened at the Grand Theater or the Dahua Theater. Minhua has been preparing for the filming of this film for more than a year, refining it through many trials, taking it seriously, and spending as much as 200,000 yuan. It is willing to release it in domestic theaters. The contract with the Jincheng Theater was signed the other night (1st), allowing it to be screened around Christmas. The Jincheng Theater has obtained this blockbuster film. In order to show its importance, in addition to renovating the entire theater from now on, it will also close for two days before the screening to meet the audience with a brand new look at that time. The audience has been eager for "Confucius" for a long time. Those who have watched the film's preview have praised it, and with the screening imminent, everyone is waiting with anticipation.</p>
<h3>Guolian Contract Expires; Bai Hong Joins Jin Xing; To Star in "Song of Shanghai"</h3>
<p>— Jia Ying</p>
<p>After starring in "Fairy of the World," Bai Hong leapt from the music scene to become a film artist. Her acting skills have improved even more in recent years. Not long ago, someone said that she was going to leave Shanghai. As a result, the facts shattered the conspiracy of the slanderers. Recently, her contract with Guolian expired, and her future actions have attracted much attention from all parties.</p>
<p>The reporter met her yesterday at the Xin Xin Company's New Market to buy things. For the convenience of the conversation, she was taken to the dining department attached to the New Market for a brief conversation.</p>
<p>She said that her contract with Guolian expired on November 15th. Recently, various companies have contacted her several times, but after several considerations, she formally accepted Jin Xing's invitation and signed the contract yesterday afternoon.</p>
<p>After joining Jin Xing, Bai Hong's first film will probably be "Song of Shanghai."</p>
<h3>Portraits of Female Artists</h3>
<p>— Tang Su</p>
<p>Bai Yuyan</p>
<p>In recent times, the "fighting skills" of female warrior actors have been popular on stage. Among those who are good at "fighting skills," Song Dezhu and Yan Shishan from Beijing are considered to be equally outstanding. In Shanghai, there are simply no male warrior actors who are famous for "fighting skills." However, Bai Yuyan, a female actor, emerged and was praised for "fighting skills" at the time, adding a lot of color to the red carpets in the south.</p>
<p>Bai Yuyan, nicknamed Lingdi, is originally from Hangzhou but grew up in Shanghai. She is nineteen years old this year and is the daughter of Bai Shuan (backstage manager of the Qiankun Grand Theater in the Great World). Bai Shuan comes from a professional acting school and is proficient in both literary and martial arts. Therefore, he taught everything in his mind to his daughter. Afterwards, he ordered Yuyan to practice martial arts with Guo Kunquan and practice moves with Shui Shangpiao (Wu Xikun's stage name), while "fighting skills" was taught by Hou Junqing. In addition, male actors Ge Huaqing, Zhao Qixia, Gu Yulan, and Li Qinxian, and female actors Bi Yuzhen, etc., have all spoken plays for Yuyan. Therefore, in addition to warrior plays, she also works as a Qingyi Huashan actor. The writer once watched her "Si Lang Visits His Mother" at the Xin Xin Stage, playing Princess Tie Jing. Her performance and singing were very good, but her fame is not due to "fighting skills." She is capable of everything that Song Dezhu and Yan Shishan have, and some of the techniques she is capable of are not available to Song and Yan. Even insiders unanimously admit that her moves are swift and steady, and can encompass the strengths of the Song and Yan schools. Looking around the Jiangnan opera scene, apart from Bai Yuyan, there is indeed no other female actor who can "fight skills" and compete with her.</p>
<p>Because of her proficiency in "fighting skills," when she joined the Gong Stage in early autumn, the Gong Stage specially arranged an armed Weaver Girl in "The Cowherd and the Weaver Girl" for her, adding a scene of eliminating demons so that she had the opportunity to show her strengths. The Weaver Girl in "The Cowherd and the Weaver Girl" performs large-scale fighting, which is unprecedented, and Bai Yuyan pioneered it. Now, the Gong Stage is rehearsing nine volumes of "Living Buddha Jigong," and she has a performance of playing four whips, which is full of highlights and greatly welcomed by the audience.</p>
<p>She is a Peking opera employee, but she is fond of spoken drama. She is very familiar with Tang Ruoqing, and she once said: "If I have the opportunity, I would really like to perform in a spoken drama!"</p>
<h3>Yi Hua Films "A Story of Laughter"</h3>
<p>Recently, various film companies have gradually become enthusiastic about fashion films. After Zhang Henshui's "The Noble Families of Qinhuai" was filmed by Jin Xing, it was followed by Yi Hua Company's "A Story of Laughter." When Yi Hua was preparing to film this film, there was a strong intention to have Li Qinian play the lead role. After several meetings, it was finally decided to use Li Lihua. It is said that Li Lihua's performance of singing a large drum song in this film is very vivid. It is generally believed that Li Lihua will become even more popular due to the release of "A Story of Laughter." "A Story of Laughter" is a well-known masterpiece; and Li Lihua playing Shen Fengxi is no less than Zhang Henshui's ideal character.</p>
