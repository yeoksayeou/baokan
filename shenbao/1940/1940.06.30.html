<h3 id="c6">羅馬尼亞危機與歐局 <a href="#c6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>歐洲大局的又一幕新發展，蘇聯於前日派兵開始進占羅馬尼亞北部。先一二日，蘇聯兩度向羅馬尼亞要求割讓比薩拉比亞及布柯維納北部；及至二十八日正午，其先遣部隊，逐通過羅國邊境，到達預定地點。同時據外電所傳，匈牙利也已向羅國提出割讓德蘭斯斐尼亞的要求，而保加利亞對於收回杜勃魯加問題，亦作積極行動。巴爾幹半島素有歐洲火山之稱，此度大戰發生以來，已十閱月，巴爾幹有如灼膚而火山竟未爆發；這正因為國際競爭過分複雜，彼此掣肘皆深，反而倖獲茍安。但是蘇羅問題的表面化，實不啻為一種嚴重警號。現在蘇羅業已推定代表，在奧德賽舉行談判，辦理割讓領土事宜；將來究竟能否順利解決，抑或枝節橫生，都難逆睹；而匈牙利保加利亞兩國的對羅交涉，其前途發展如何，亦在未可知之數。但是無論怎樣，當前羅馬尼亞危機之將嚴重影響未來歐局，那是可以斷言的。</p>
<p>現時羅國領土之成問題的，有下列四地區：（一）是比薩拉比亞，在羅馬尼亞東北部，介於普路斯和德聶斯脫兩河之間，於一八一二年由土耳其割讓給俄國。當地居民約三百萬人，其中羅馬尼亞人烏克蘭人俄羅斯人大概各占三分之一。因此在上次歐洲大戰期間，即一九一七年，俄國發生革命後，羅馬尼亞逐兼倂了比薩拉比亞。此項兼併，其後雖於一九二二·一九二四和一九二七年相繼為英法義三國所承認，但蘇聯則從未對此表示同意。（二）是布柯維納，位在羅馬尼亞北部，本屬奧國，上次歐戰之後，始割歸羅馬尼亞；人口約九十萬，其中半數為小俄羅斯人，多集中北部，此外尚有三分之一為羅馬尼亞人。（三）是德蘭斯斐尼亞，在羅馬尼亞西北角，本屬匈牙利，於第一次歐戰後為羅馬尼亞所得；人口約三百萬，半數為羅馬尼亞人，三分之一為匈牙利人；前者多屬希臘正教，後者多屬羅馬舊教；信仰既殊，種族互異；加之匈人文化較高，頗不願受羅馬尼亞統治，所以時起齟齬。（四）是杜勃魯加，在羅馬尼亞東南部，其中一部分是一八七八年被羅國取得的，極南端的一部分則於一九一三年從保加利亞手中奪來，因此杜勃魯加南部居民，幾盡為保加利亞人，其地位之不安定，可想而知。</p>
<p>我們從上述簡單的歷史回顧看來，就可約略曉得這四個問題內容之複雜；此中齟齬的是非曲直，實在不易斷言。羅馬尼亞也未嘗不知道本身處境之艱難，因之於一九二二年和捷克斯拉夫及南斯拉夫締約交歡，號稱小協約；又在一九三四年聯合希臘，土耳其以及南斯拉夫，共結巴爾幹協約，以謀鞏固本國之地位；對於英法和德國，也力採妥協政策，多方示好，以求安全。但是他的內政，頻年頗形混亂，國勢未見向上發展；營營終歲，亟亟於國際的緩衝，現在到了緊急關頭，到底難免於受人宰割。這就是今日羅馬尼亞的命運，一方面固然值得同情，一方面也頗足發人深省。</p>
<p>羅馬尼亞危機發展的結果，有一點已經很為顯明：就是蘇聯佔領了比薩拉比亞和布柯維納北部之後，蘇聯在歐洲的戰略地位，更形強固。過去蘇聯的取得波蘭東部，壓服芬蘭，並且駐兵於立陶宛·拉脫維亞·和愛沙尼亞，是增強了右翼；而現在的占領羅馬尼亞北部，則又是增強了左翼；不但如此，並且為將來開闢黑海門戶，取得一更前進的根據地。最近歐洲諸強國中，法國已被擊潰，德義和英國，方在積極準備賭國軍的大戰；而蘇聯則一面力避捲入戰爭漩渦，一面加緊增強本國國防地位。多方拓展，其範圍不僅限於歐洲；即如北冰洋區和西伯利亞區的海空航綫及陸地交通，近來均有長足進展；劇本月份美國「亞細亞」雜誌的調查，由海森崴到堪察加　蘇聯已建立空軍根據地十三處，常駐飛機至少有一千架，此其假想敵人，必然的，非日本莫屬。由此可知，倘因蘇聯之發展勢力於東南歐，逐謂其將放棄遠東而不顧，如日本方面所宣傳者，實為一種歪曲的觀察，自欺的慰藉。同時蘇聯之向黑海南進，事前雖得德義默契，但是國際的悲觀恩怨，輒因時因事而明中滋長，暗中演變，親疎角逐，向着正反兩面發展。倘若以三四天來羅馬尼亞所遭逢的危機，視為羅馬尼亞一國的榮辱，一國的消長，那是表面的問題，亦是平面的觀察；倘若視此為羅國與蘇聯匈牙利保加利亞諸國的爭訟，亦還不夠；倘若以所謂默契為衷誠歡洽，則未免十分厚道，要知道，羅國所遭逢的，亦正是蘇聯與德義以及與英國土耳其之間，方來的種種開展，將以此機微妙的契機，請拭目以觀之。</p>

<p>英駐華大使寇爾博士、昨日假座福音電台、於中午十二時四十五分及下午九時、先後作兩次播音、向旅華英僑作戰時捐款之呼籲、茲將其演講全文錄下、數月以來、每欲用無綫廣播、與在華之吾國人士接觸、但此項願望終未得價、返滬後、深覺與諸君之接觸、不容或　、今余所欲言者、際此艱難時期、余身　大使之職、與在華之英國當局、對諸君之一切困難、極　關懷、必要時、亦願予以指導、</p>
<p>英願應付任何艱難</p>
<p>諸君對首相最近發表之演辭諒已讀過、渠以激昂之語調、與勇毅之態度、說明吾國目前所處之環境、數日前、彼會在下院　稱、英國已準備應付任何艱難、今特摘數語如下、「吾人應　發精神勇往直前、千載以後、大英帝國設仍存在、人類回顧今日、將認為歷史上最偉大之時期、」此寥寥數句壯語、足徵今日吾國國民之精神、使目前奮鬬達到勝利之一日、凡我在華之國人、當視之為黑暗中之火炬、而循此前進、</p>
<p>決心運用自身力量</p>
<p>人不必諱言、今日自身所處之危機、在歷史上、亦不乏前例、吾人今日並不孤立、環繞吾人之左右前後者、有大英帝國聯邦之意志堅強之人民、同時帝國及友邦之無限資源與援助、五人對之、亦深可信賴、故時至今日、吾人對當前之事業、自身力量與運用此力量之決心、應具有信心、不應失望、余　諸君皆能運用沉毅之決心與勇氣以赴偉大的時代、</p>
<p>抑制情緒杜絕挑釁</p>
<p>於此余特以一事相告、明　如諸君、斯舉或屬多餘、吾人僑居之中國、係一中立國、尤其上海、為一國際都市、此後當深自抑制、不宜有挑釁之舉動、</p>
<p>縮食節衣猶虞不足</p>
<p>余深知居住中國境內之英國國民、際此時期咸願將其生命財產置諸國家支配之下、吾人若能節衣縮食、則貢獻於國家者、亦殊可觀、但此猶虞不足、茲特將余本人所擬之計劃、略述如次、</p>
<p>自動捐輸充實國庫</p>
<p>返滬後、余對英國國民之踴躍輸將精神、獲一深刻之印象、余深信此種精神、亦充份表現於旅華各地英僑之間、據余觀察、目前所缺者、即督促此種精神實現之領導、余今願負此領導之責任、向在華同胞與商號呼籲、務使自動捐輸、以充實國庫、余知諸君對此舉盼待已久、當熱誠　應、</p>
<p>先籌鉅款　募月捐</p>
<p>吾人刻已組織一小組委員會、以進行下述計劃、即立籌巨款、　以按月捐款、以作戰需、有人提議此項捐款應強迫施行、但余不予贊同、據余個人意見、一切捐款、應本個人良心、量力而為、茲為便利捐款事宜起見、在滬或其他地點組織小組委員會以資指導、並對遠東之特殊情形、與貿易狀況、加以相當考慮、此外、並與　　銀行·商恰代收捐款與給發收據、在其他未設有英國銀行之地點、捐款可　交英領事館代收、此項「志願戰時捐款」、可用支票繳付、辦理捐款之銀行、應按月將實收之款項、再由各地領事館負責將捐款經上海匯交英國政府、關於此項計劃之詳細辦法、當另函詳述之、</p>
<p>具體計劃已在進行</p>
<p>諸君諒已知曉上海刻已有戰時儲蓄之組織、吾人可以極微款目、投資於政府基金、自戰事爆發以還、吾國中央戰時捐款機關、業已收到巨量捐款、以充慈善、如英國紅十字會以及慰勞軍隊之用、其中詳情、母容贅述、惟此項工作、與余所提出之計劃、略有不同之處、余深知在華同胞中多數人對現有職務、尚覺未能盡力為國服務、余對此亦具有同樣之感想與深刻之同情、余前次廣播時、會稱彼等之責任、應繼續執行各有之職務、今堪以告慰者、目前具體計劃已在進行之中、余深望彼等之疑實與猶豫不決之心理、將因此而消除也、諸君幸母誤會政府對彼等之志願與忠心、置諸罔聞、其實際此多事之秋、百事待決、國內當局對吾人所視為急務者、未必能兼籌並願、吾人應諒解當局之苦衷也、</p>
<p>使館關懷各地英橋</p>
<p>在結束廣播以前、余再鄭重聲明、本使館與各地領事當局極願與各地英橋團體維持密切接觸、並盡量予以援助與指導、諸君對此當前應行事務自有可以自行決定之處、但際此非常時間、當局對諸君個人問題、亦極為關懷、且樂予以援助、</p>

<h3 id="c68">馮炳南紀念母壽詞（三）　闡揚八德精義歸於至孝　勤儉與自助為八德基礎 <a href="#c68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>我國的道德，舊說有孝•悌•忠·信·禮•義•廉·恥·八德之說，八德之中，以孝字當先，可見孝之一德，實爲八德之主，是爲人之木。古人說：「孝弟也者，其爲人之本歟，」這話是很對的，一個人的一切道德行爲，都要先從本身做起，所以大學重修身，念及本身所自來，自然就會發生孝念，一個人若要盡孝，則其餘的七德，都不可或缺。</p>
<p>孝經上說：「夫孝，天之經也，地之義也，民之行也」。所謂「民之行」，意思當然是說凡是人民都應該有孝行，可見古人亦已見到孝道與全民有很大的關係，照鄙人上面的說法，則尤其是民族的生存問題。</p>
<p>八德之中，第二是悌，悌是什麼？據朱子的解釋：「善事兄長爲悌，」說文的解釋，是「善兄弟也，」意思就是說，兄弟要友愛，不止弟順於兄，更要兄愛其弟，因爲兄弟都是父母所生，對於兄弟能友愛，就同對於父母能孝敬一樣，所以悌之爲德，亦不離乎孝。</p>
<p>曾子說：「居處不莊，非孝。」「莊，」就是恭敬有「禮」，又說：「事君不忠，非孝。」君、王時代，以君爲國家的元首，爲國家的代表，忠於君，就是忠於國。一個人不止對於國家要忠，就是做不論什麼事情，都要盡忠。忠，就是「內盡其心，而不欺也。」曾子說的「爲人謀，而不忠乎，」可見這個忠字，可以適用於一切。曾子又說「蒞官不敬非孝，」意思是說，做官的不可不尊重他的職責，做官的尊重他的職責，莫如盡力做他義所應爲之事，處己則莫尚於廉潔，如果不能廉潔，不能盡力，做義所應爲之事，那就是「蒞官不敬。」不止做官的要這樣，就是我們出來無論做什麼事，那一件不應該循義而行，廉隅自守呢？又說：「朋友不信，非孝。」信，就是誠實不欺，說了就要做。又說：「戰陣無勇，非孝。」論語說：「知恥近乎勇。」戰陣而能勇，就是知恥，一個人不止戰陳，要有勇，就是不論做什麼事，只要是義所應爲的，都要有勇氣，應付一切艱難困苦，都要有勇氣，能有勇氣，就是知恥。</p>
<p>據上所言，則悌·忠·信·禮·義•廉·恥，都包括在孝的範圍之內，一個人對於八德有虧其一的，便是辱及父母，與父母生育兒女的宗旨相背，所以要盡孝道，就八德都要顧到，所以說孝是八德之主。</p>
<p>做父母的生育兒女，目的固然是爲自己的宗族延續，此外還有一個更廣大而未必自覺的目的，就是要爲國家，爲民族，爲社會，爲人類，養成健全的分子。如果一個人在八德之中有所虧缺，就不能算得健全，就是道德上的不健全，這種不健全，會大傷父母之心，不惟傷父母之心，而且害及社會，這就是不孝，所以八德都包括在孝道之內。</p>
<p>古人所舉的八德，已經包羅很廣，但是鄙人以爲還有三件很切要，很具體的，應該補充進去。第一件就是自助，第二是勤，第三是儉，關於自助，等一會在下文講到社會福利事業時再細說。至於勤和儉，不止是做人的美德，簡直是做人的必要條件，因爲一個人最需要的就是能生活，而父母所期望於兒女的也是期望他能生活，能成功立業。要生活，就不能不勤，大禹治水，陶侃運　，都是好例證。世界上沒有勤而不能生活的人，世界上亦沒有成功的人不由勤苦中出來的。儉也是生活上不可少的德行，這種德行，不止影響個人的生活，而且可以影響全個社會，因爲一個人如果奢侈無度，所耗用的超過自己的生產能力，就必定會妄求非分，起初則貪婪，漸漸就成爲攘奪，不惜作奸犯科，傷天害理。一個社會中不能持儉的人多了，這個社會就會生出種種不安和混亂，孝悌忠信禮義廉恥八德是很好的，是做人的基礎，要維持這八德，則自助和勤儉，尤爲基礎之基礎。</p>

<p>昨日外幣市況、烚赤終於趨漲、英美金鎊跟隨上漲、英金票稍有需要、市價略漲、美金票以英鎊突又回落、故黑市美匯驟緊、致買氣又盛、晚市升至十六元三角半、比上日軋漲二角半、香港票需要激減、市價回落二分、坎拿大票稍有需要、市價略漲、日金票需要愈旺、市價晚市升至一元一角六分、朝鮮票供求均勻、晚市仍為九角七分半、</p>

<p>昨日现金烚赤暗盤市况、於買賣敵對之下、走勢堅穩、半日間上落亦小、而視經營概無長久心思、再以外匯今軟昨鬆、入徘徊之狀、金價亦跟之盤旋、晨開爲五千四百五十元、乃美匯報緊、惟不久證券帮銀號來售、跌落五十元、嗣爲金號錢兌業拉進後升三十餘元、然散戶此時突欲吐賣、故未幾軍告挫跌、收盤前匯市終軟、證券帮銀號曾撈吸若干、抬至五千四百三十五元、結果五千四百三十元收盤、較上日軋漲五十元、場外潛勢堅挺、五千四百五十元有買戶、而無售者、午後週六無市、又自今天星期日起、至下週二止、爲銀錢業半年結帳之期、循例休市三天、半天交易約一千餘兩、銀樓飾金掛大九十元、海關金等仍平、</p>

<p>飾金回高十元</p>

<p>證券暗盤昨市祗做半日交易、浮多因有三日休假、爲減少利息負擔起見、稍有賣出、適某銀行已停止收買、市價乃稍稍減軟、但交易極為清閑、故市價上落亦極微、絕無大戶參加、祗同裕聯益以及少數客戶買進、聯和天豐及六十四號賣出、總成交不過二十萬元之譜、市價略小五分一角、茲列簡明表於後、週一二兩天爲銀行決算期、停市兩天、</p>

<p>米市承上日午後漲勢、晨開即見帶緊、乃被港越事件影響、人心甚爲激昂、並以今明兩天停市、實銷方面亦復儘量收買、以應門市需要、而行囤納胃既貪、內地復有爭辦、市乃節節上升、午後買氣尤在、市面愈見奔騰、一路直上、再接再厲、迄將市未稍鐵羽、收盤行情較前收竟漲二三元之巨、若一號陳西貢又至六十五元半、六十五元、二號六十三元半、六十三元、火絞六十四元二角、六十四元、一號暹邏六十五元、六十四元六角、二號六十三元三角、六十二元八角、小絞六十二半、東京砶尖五十九元半、五十九元、混合碎五十二元、五十一元半、米　五十四元、五十三元、回　有十八裝二號邏米初開六十八元九角、旋至七十十元半、二十六裝六十九元半及六十九元、全日開二百多噸、現貨則開出近二萬包云、</p>

<p>又訊、本市當局方面、鑒於粉價之連漲三次、並零售粉價暗抬、頗為關懷、經前日召集粉商一度討論、對於粉號售價、不得過於抬高、根據現市廠盤每包規定售價十五元五角、不得超越、並應儘先供應切麵餅饅大餅油條各業、一俟新麥原料充分接濟後、廠盤亦當即予減低云、</p>

<p>現棉交易依然靜寂、各方皆無需要、此種景象、都係昔日購訂之棉充足、目前大衆有過剩之慮、所以市面絕無生氣也、微聞日廠稍有採辦、然銀款須遲一二個月交付、</p>
<p>另訊外面市價、紐約棉市、晨初開盛因投機者之購買而漲、後因現貨商之賣出、及一部份多頭了結、結果市況轉疲、收盤價格、較之上日跌落四五磅音、印度棉市、當地因運輸困難、存棉於孟買、政府究能否受報兵險、頗屬疑問、現貨商將棉交給交易所者頗衆、故昨日連同預測跌十羅比、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、日來雖見靜寂、然六月底之大關、業已穩靜渡過、且印棉之運輸、困難日增、兵險費亦高漲不已、滬上存底日見枯涸、一般棉商俱認按照目前形勢、能維持至一相當時期、日商廠首先採辦、屆時棉價即將高漲、故同業間之心思、已轉堅定矣、</p>

<p>國布　昨市六底交割、以本月份期額遠較前數期爲寡、故市面過程形勢平穩、後以棉紗報漲、囤戶覓廉略有拖進、缺檔各貨每疋回漲二角半至五角、本街成交白貨漂染布五百餘件、浙贛帮辦色布細布粗布一百數十件、港帮辦料紋粗布一百餘間、國外新加坡等地辦漂布漂斜色布一千數百疋、</p>

<h3 id="c110">英倫海峽的今昔 <a href="#c110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>杜佛港一帶白色的巉巖峭壁，乃是在外國領土上可以望得見的英國唯一部份。這天然的白堊墻垣突出英吉利海峽碧波三百英尺，這上面，在天氣晴明的時候，可以遙遙的看到二十英里外的法國海岸，形成一條細長的灰綫，亘延於地平綫下。英國人瞭解他們的民族性端由這杜佛一帶的海岸，而造成人類歷史的，也無出這英吉利海峽一衣帶水之右的了。</p>
<p>在這個年頭，人們的意念自然會直覺地轉到這結實的墻垣及其脚下的塹壕。英倫三島賴其保衛者已二千年於茲。海岸一帶碉堡羅列，弓箭爲其最古的防禦武器，現在則代以高射砲和探照燈。不過羅馬帝國時代所造的燈塔，曾親見英國的海軍胚胎而成舉世無敵的艦隊，今日仍在指示往來海峽的船隻，作爲這裏已是陸地的標誌。</p>
<p>這海峽，不僅在物質上使英國與歐陸隔離，且在精神上使英國懷着唯我獨尊的氣槪。她的文化雖出自歐洲，她的心胸却憶念着散佈海外的兒女。她早想啟椗離開歐洲的瘋人院。但是談何容易，她好歹須與歐洲共存亡呀。</p>
<p>數年前，英國前任首相鮑爾溫偶然在國會裏宣佈英國的邊境在萊茵河。當時一般英國人或者並不多大注意這句話，以爲英國的邊境要近得多哩。二千年前，凱撒大帝曾經編成了一個艦隊，在一天夜晚，從現在法國的波洛業港偷襲杜佛，發覺峭巖中守兵荷戰持戈，嚴陣以待，凱撒乃飭令水兵順流而下，開到現在的第爾港附近海灘，乘虛登陸。英國就這樣立國了。</p>
<p>六百年後，聖奧古斯德率領了許多傳敎士乘船駛過杜佛，到斯都爾河口上岸，英國的文化就此發軔。</p>
<p>到了一〇六六年，英國又被諾曼第的威廉公所征服，但一五八八年的西班牙艦隊和一八〇四年的拿破崙艦隊，雖想渡海征英，均被擊敗。</p>
<p>自是厥後，戰術日新月異。飛機可以飛渡，戰車亦可由空中運輸，英國自不得不在海峽外較遠的地方覔求國防的邊錢，她愈加不能對歐洲事掉頭不顧。所以一般人都說，法蘭西之戰就是不列顚之戰的前哨戰。</p>

<h3 id="c113">日斑的研究 <a href="#c113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>— 伯明</p>
<p>古代人民，幾無不崇拜太陽，求其一夜後再來。時至今日，我們對這供給光，熱，力的日球，却認爲當然必有之物。必遇日蝕或日斑擾亂地面電訊交通等特殊現象時，我們纔注意到太陽。</p>
<p>使人們不尊重太陽的是天文學家。他從望遠鏡和分光太陽攝影機中見到太陽祇是環繞宇宙無數星辰之一。這顆星辰旣不特別龐大，亦不格外明亮。從天文學家的觀點說，太陽的引人注意點，祗在它是最近的一顆星，距地球不過九千三百萬英里。一綫日光，祗需八分鐘，便可照到地面。其他最近的星光，至少需四年，才能觸及地面。</p>
<p>我們對於太陽和星辰能最感興趣的問題是：使他們發光的是什麼呢？人類最初求此解答時，以爲太陽是一大洪爐，以墜落其中的隕星和其他宇宙間殘物充燃料。近代天文學家開始用紙筆來計算，立刻發覺這種燃料的供給，顯極微少。</p>
<p>據最近估計，太陽本質，重二，〇〇〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇噸。假如太陽藉本質燃燒，祇能維持發熱二千年。可是，人們久已證明地面受着太陽的熱，至少已有二十萬萬年。更就太陽的熱度來說，它的熱度之高，已不容物質燃燒。卽使在太陽表面，熱達華氏一萬度，這上面的原子，激劇動盪，已不逞和氧氣合成所謂「燃燒」的化學混合物。這樣看來，太陽發射能力，實有一種不同的方法</p>
<p>這方法現經科學所承認的，是以相對論的一項公式爲基礎。這公式說小量的物就等於大質的力。然而，它是怎樣變化的呢？在地面實騐室中，人們還未能擬定實用的變化過程</p>
<p>凡是熱度騰高，各物便激動起來。在太陽內部火窟中，原子以每秒鐘許多英哩的速率，來往馳動。那裏酷熱異常，在地面上成固體的硬物，如鐵和碳，都像氣體模樣。原子便在這種狀態中極速的馳動，相互撞擊，而成新原子。這種新原子常較舊原子少些，兩者所差的原子，發揮一種光力。照目前的理論，這種光力便使太陽發光。</p>
<p>太陽中旣有這樣强大的力在動着，它當然不能安然存在。我們可料到太陽氣圈中有着巨大的風波和漩渦。我們在日斑和太陽紅燄中所發現的，恰正是這種風波和漩渦。太陽紅燄，在日蝕時，最易見到。</p>
<p>月亮有時剛在太陽和地球中間，遮沒地面所見的日光，便成日蝕。當太陽全被月亮黑影遮沒時，我們可用望遠鏡見到太陽邊緣上發出明亮的紅色氣燄，這便是太陽的紅燄，被日光的壓力所迫着升出。</p>
<p>在完全日蝕時，除紅燄外，還能見到一圈靑白色的朦光，名四日暈。日暈的眞正性質如何，天文學家還認爲是個疑團。不過現有一點綫索，卽日暈的形狀就像地面情勢，似乎照太陽面上的黑斑數目而定。黑斑多時，日暈作圓形，黑斑極少時，日暈便成歪斜。</p>
<p>那末，日斑究竟是什麼呢？原來這是隨時可見到的「黑斑」。這些「斑點」本身原是明亮的，熱的七千度。只是比較太陽表面主要部份的熱度低數千度。兩相比較，便見它似乎黑晤了，多數日斑太小，不用望遠放大鏡便望不見。可是，卽使是「小」的日斑，實在也大得足以吞下整個地面。</p>
<p>我們知道它的實在大小時，再以「斑」字稱之，不免有些小看了它。然而歷來都用「斑」字，我們只得服從沿革。從普通望遠鏡所攝照片看來，日斑確實很像微斑。這也許是日斑不同的深度，日斑漩渦中不同的原質發出光芒，使日斑本身糢糊所致。現有一種更好的方法，便是用分光太陽攝影機來攝取照片。</p>
<p>日光能化爲彩虹，而在特殊熱度中特殊原質發出的一種顏色，却是攝影機最易感受的。所以攝成照片，焦點異常準確。從這照片可見日斑好似太陽氣圈中的大漩渦，在地面上，也有和這類似的東西。這便是氣象地圖中所繪的熱帶旋風，發出風勢，成一大螺旋式。日斑就像太陽上的大漩渦，迴旋着的氣體被吸入漩渦時，乘機膨漲和冷却，正如家用冷藏箱中的蒸氣一般。</p>
<p>那末，這漩渦又是什麼呢？原來這裏面沒有空氣，也沒水份，只是微細的氣狀原子，和原子的各部份，充滿電氣，從旋轉着的電氣而產生磁性。威爾遜山天文臺故主任海爾博士曾發現日斑實卽是龐大的電磁，無疑的，它必使傳遞無綫電訊的人造電磁波受到影響。</p>
<p>日斑多寡不同，也是有時太陽上面同時有日斑達二十處之多，時而一處都不見。一世紀前，德國台梭地方曾有個初習天文學的人，名喚舒華勃，以藥劑師爲業，每日公餘，計算日斑數目，歷數年不輟。他還追溯往時的紀錄，而發現日斑的盛衰，的計十一年一轉，再用日斑數目製成圖表，和時間相對照，有時看來好像證券市塲的漲落表。很多人鄭重其事地說，日斑的週轉，乃是地球上輪期發生經濟恐慌，和繁榮的內在原因。</p>
<p>爲辯明這些說數起見，且先一述太陽對於我們有何「正常」的關係。太陽對地面每一方碼，平均施加一個瓩的力，這已足使一家大百貨商店的電泡，全都發光。這種力，吸起海水，並發風推動浮雲。我們知道日光有多種顏色，從紅色以至紫色，可從彩虹一一分出。此外，還有目不能見的顏色，這便是被照到時便覺熱的紅外綫和使皮膚發赤褐色的紫外綫。這些光綫中有幾種也使上層氣圈充電，造成目不能見的電層。無綫波受其反應，才使無錢電能隔重洋播音。</p>
<p>研究日斑的最高威權史蒂森博士曾蒐集很多材料，證明日光中紫外錢成份，跟着日斑的多寡而不同。紫外綫旣能發揮維太命而促進人類的健康。所以史博士預料日斑的或多或少，也許對人類性情有反感。史博士近著「日斑及其影響」一書中，臚列近年來證票市塲價格的漲落，和日斑數目相對照。</p>
<p>一九二八年問，日斑極多。一九二九年初市塲價格上漲極高。日斑减少後，市塲便告劇跌。一九三二年市塲價格極低，一九三三年的日斑數也極少。其後兩者都見增漲。日斑愈多，市塲也愈活潑。所以投機者最好跟着日斑而交易。不過這也許祇是碰釘而已。史博士以爲人們對於這一點，不可武斷的認爲必然或反對，因爲整個事情還需澈底研究呢。若竟發現地面溫度和人類性情，確和日斑有關係，還是未必能斷言日斑是其起因。日斑也許祗是太陽中更深處變化的徵象而已。</p>
<p>當新的日斑突然出現而長大時，地面上立刻感受到磁暴。磁暴也能發電。原來磁性在動時，產生電流，這便是電力廠發電的原理。所以磁暴發出强有力的電流通過人造的電綫時，將電報信號和電話聲浪都吸了去。日斑發出的磁暴，影響所及，擾亂無棧電波層。</p>
<p>一九三八年，日斑之多，幾乎創新紀錄。現在却不是十一年一轉的日斑最多時期。然而前幾個月內，曾有幾個較平常爲大的日斑出現，它所佔的總面積，雖祇及一九三七年到一九三八年日斑面積之半，有綫電和無棧電交通却已受極大阻碍了。</p>

<p>現代科學界致力於日斑之研究者甚多，美國天文學家牛康氏，前據精確之推算，謂最大之日斑，每隔十一年零四十三日而一見，日斑所畀地面之影饗，其著要者有三事，一爲地震，一一爲奇寒，三爲戰亂，計自一六一〇年發明望遠鏡以來，每見日球面，發生特大之黑斑，世上恒遇大地震，此殆因日球地球之本體，俱以鐵質占其大部分，日斑擴大之時，電磁力自亦隨之加大，或以引起地殼之推動也，一六一〇年以前，無望遠鏡可以窺天，然如耶穌紀元七十九年舉世震驚之大地震，其距紀元二百零二年三十五公里外可聞爆發聲之奇災，前後恰滿百二十三年，若準十一年又四十三日之數，的略推算，則最大日斑之經消退而復達於極大之時，至此正爲十一决，又如一九一七年·一九二九年·一九四〇年之歐美等地三度奇寒，先後之相距，各爲十一年，亦皆巧遇日斑最大之年，又我中華古說，每謂治亂有關乎天象。最近法國神父兼預言家謨烈，本其觀象台積久之經騐，描寫日斑加大與退减之歷程，且謂世界重大兵災，莫不發生於彼日斑向上加大之際，此君今按日斑起伏之跡爲論斷，預言本年耶穌聖誕節前，世界必將重見太平。</p>
<h3 id="c115">越南與中國的關係 <a href="#c115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>— 徐松石</p>
<p>今日所謂越南，包括東京·老撾·安南·交趾·柬埔寨五大區域。這五個區域，在一八八五年中法戰爭之前，統稱安南王國，乃是中國的藩屬。</p>
<p>越南最初稱爲南垂；史謂燧人氏遊於南垂，發明取火之術，就是這個地方。後來稱爲南交；路史引眞源賦，謂神農經土分域，南交北幽，靡不戾止。尚書堯典說，堯命羲叔宅南交。尚書大傳且說堯南撫交趾，於禹貢荊州之南垂，幽荒之處，故越也。南垂卽是南交，昭然可見。</p>
<p>周成王時，有越裳氏從這越南地方來貢方物。古今注說周公致太平，越裳氏重譯來獻白雉一，黑雉二，象牙一。使者迷其歸路，周公錫以文錦二疋，軿車五乘，皆爲司南之製，使越裳氏載之以南。當時越南顯然早已沾受中原的文化。</p>
<p>秦始皇開闢嶺南三郡，所謂象郡，卽大部包括越南之地。史記謂始皇遣發罪人戍卒以實三郡。可見秦時越南在血統方面，已與中原漢族混成一體。今日的安南人，只是漢人的後裔罷了。</p>
<p>當時越南的土著稱爲駱越。秦末蜀王子將兵三萬，佔有其地，自立爲安陽王。後來雄據嶺外的南越王趙陀破滅安陽，越南又與今日兩廣的地方聯成一片。袁枚有詩說，趙王父子開邊界，賴種蘭珠一朶花。銅弩三千隨婿去，女兒心太爲夫家。原來趙陀遣子詐降安陽，娶安陽王女蘭珠，而吞併越南全境，還有這樣的一段風流韻事呢。</p>
<p>漢武帝元鼎六年，平南越趙氏，立嶺南九郡。越南所包括的卽交趾九眞日南三郡。今日的兩廣和安南，當時統稱交州。治龍編縣，卽今越南河內。漢時越南在中國國防上的重要性，可以一想而知。</p>
<p>後漢光武時，交趾女子徵側微貳反，馬伏波將軍出兵討平之。且闢柬埔寨境地爲象林縣。前史家張勃說象林縣在交趾南，馬援所植兩銅柱以表漢界處也。援北還，留十餘戶於銅柱所。至隋有三百餘戶，悉姓馬，土人以爲流寓，號曰馬流人，亦曰馬留人。根據作者的研究，近代馬來人馬來由馬來亞馬來半島等名稱，均因是而起。北部馬來人雜有漢人血統，自無疑義。兩漢時代越南全境的治理，與中國內地實無分別。</p>
<p>唐朝越南隸屬中國，也與內地無殊。安南都護府的建設，規模非常宏偉。可惜蒙氏南詔割據滇境，安南都護府也曾一次失陷。迨後宋朝孱弱，元祚不長，安南始離中國而獨立，有阮氏黎氏陳氏等相繼爲主。然而在這數百年間，安南文化仍始終是中國文化的一部分而已。</p>
<p>明朝初年，越市又爲中國之所統一。永樂年間，在其地設交州·北江·諒江·三江·建平·新安·建昌·奉化··淸化·鎭蠻·諒山·新平·又安·順化·升華等十五府。爲時雖不久，復有黎氏僭立，但當時的州府名稱，至今還大部沿用。而且自淸初以至一八八五年，安南乃中國異常恭順的藩屬。越南與中國的關係，可謂密切極了。</p>

<p>— 盧冠六</p>
<p>小朋友們作文，最容易患以下三種毛病：</p>
<p>第一種毛病是敷衍塞責　有許多小朋友，不明瞭作文是一個人在日常生活裏應用的一種重要工具，只認為老師給他做的一種工作，學校裏規定的一種功課，所以不得不敷衍一下。往往馬馬虎虎，寫了幾句，做了幾行，就此交卷。字體既潦草模糊，文章也毫無意思。抱著態度作文，就是做了一輩子，也不會有進步的。</p>
<p>第二種毛病是存心抄襲　更有許多小朋友，倚賴心很重。自己不肯努力，却專想取巧。當老師的題目在黑板上出現以後，他自己不肯去思索，却東張西望，看同學們是在怎樣的下筆，自己好模仿一下？或者請問老師：這題目有甚麽意思，希望老師講給他聽，甚至帶了一本甚麼模範作文，翻來翻去，看有沒有現成的範文，可以抄抄？這樣存心倚賴，不肯苦心思索，文章一定不會進步的。</p>
<p>第三種毛病是容易灰心　更有許多小朋友，很知道作文的重要，很想求自己的作文的進步。起初的時候，也很用心的想，也很努力的做。但是過了幾星期，自己看不出有顯著的進步，因此就灰心起來，不肯再下苦工。其實一個人能夠發現自己的缺點，覺得不滿意的時候，已經是有進步了。只要肯繼續努力，加緊用功，一定可以竿頭日上，邁步前進。要知道工夫決沒有白用的；用一分工夫，得一分成績。古人說得好：「只要工夫深，鐵棒磨成針。」可見只要你肯下苦功，沒有不會進步，不會成功的道理。</p>
<p>「自有病，自得知」「自有病，自得知。」小朋友在作文時，是否有上面的毛病，只有你自己知道了。身體上發生了毛病，得請教醫生，依方服藥，才能恢復健康。作文發現了毛病，也得請教醫生，不過這個「醫生」，就是「你自己」。你得自己診斷，自己開方，自己糾正，才能使自己的作文恢復健康。</p>
<p>申報在暑期中舉行暑期作文競賽，無異替小朋友組織一個暑期作文健康營，使作文上患毛病小朋友，得利用假期的暇閑，恢復作文的健康。使作文上本來不患病的小朋友，也得以更增進作文的健康。這個好機會，小朋友，千萬別放過了。</p>

<p>— 俞俞</p>
<p>有些小朋友，作文題目到手，急急寫作，寫了一回，覺得不對，完全塗抹，重新再寫，費時間，費精神，作文成績，仍不高明，這不是你的程度不好，還沒有懂得作文的門檻！</p>
<p>第一想定意思　比方校裏舉行過禮貌周，老師也許要出個關於禮貌的作文題，教你寫些禮貌周的紀事，還可以勉強應付，如果帶些說理的意思，便無從入手了。其實你只要先就事實想想，禮貌周中，什麽事最有意義？什麽事最有成績？什麽事還嫌不夠？不是有了三層意思嗎？次向題外想想，大家隨隨便便，不是寫意得多，爲什麽要講禮貌？到了長大成人，再講禮貌，爲什麽不妥當呢？不是又多兩層意思麼？再就題內想想，如何懂禮貌？如何會禮貌？如何行禮貌？如何習慣於禮貌？不是更多四層意思麼？</p>
<p>第二排好次序　把上述九層意思，排一個次序，或者以記事做主，議論爲副，紀事說得詳些，理論說得略些；或者以理論做主，紀事爲副，理論放在前面，說得詳些，紀事放在後面，說得略些；先把大意列成一表，文字雖未寫出，層次已經井然了。</p>
<p>第三開始寫文　照著大意表，逐層寫去，句子要簡短，意思要明白，隨手寫成，便是一篇出色文字，因為你已經完備了作文的三個要件，就是意思豐富，層次清楚，字句明白。</p>
<p>小朋友，你把我這些作文的小門檻，同暑期作業競賽的作文題來試試看，我相信你的作文成績，一定比平時要好得多呢！</p>
<h3 id="c118">自造冰箱　（下） <a href="#c118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>— 金箴</p>
<p>「哥哥，爲什麽需要這許多東西呢？普通買來的冰箱從來沒有看見過木屑。」</p>
<p>「洋鐵皮釘在木箱外層，而且洋鐵皮必須要簇新而光亮的，這樣可以把熱反射，防止熱空氣傳入箱內，那油灰是阻止熱空氣從　間傳入或冷空氣的逃出，木屑是不十分傳熱的東西，可以使火油箱不與木箱相接觸，就是把箱內外的空氣隔絕，這和熱水瓶沒有空氣的夾層是同樣的功用。」</p>
<p>「那麼我們怎樣應用呢？」</p>
<p>冰和要冷藏的東西一同放在火油箱裏，所以我們要把冷藏的東西包裹起來，不與冰直接接觸，這是比較麻煩的，但是許多人依習慣是把東西放在冰上，譬如把水果放在冰的上面，其實這是不對的，因為在冰上已冷化了的空氣，就降到下面去，而周圍的熱空氣就升上來，所以我們要使東西冷却，那應該放在冰下，因為在冰下有冷空氣之故。入股把水放在冰上，那　所冷却僅僅是水的最下層，其餘部分仍被沒有冷却的空氣所包圍，如果放在冰下，則水冷却得很快，這是什麽道理？因為被冰冷却了，水的上層，就自行下沉在杯底，較熱的水便升上，直到杯中水全部都冷却才止，同時冰四周的冷空氣，亦可下沉去而包圍在杯子的四周，所以房間裏的冷藏箱，大都把冰放在上面，而不放在下面，如果放在下面，當然也會使東西冷却，不過慢得多了。反過來說，如果我們要燒熱水，把水壺放在火上面燒，那是對的，因為被火燒着的空氣，便大大地減輕，從水壺的各方面擠出來向上跑，使水壺的水很快的沸了。</p>

<p>— 民</p>
<p>末後雷蒙先先生來訪問我們了，他說在第一部影片中，就給我充任女主角沙爾梅，要是在這第一部中表演得好的話，以後還得給我主演別的影片哩。爸爸得了道好消息，快樂得什麽似的，他說電影真是一件神妙的東西，以後凡是他女兒所主演的影片，每一部都得去看，非仔細的看一看不可。後來爸爸果然遵守他的諾言，凡是我的影片，他委實沒有一部不看，竟看了十多次。</p>
<p>我主演了好多的影片，人家便都稱我爲電影老手了。珍娓甘諾在攝影場中也有一座平屋，和我的平屋隔開一條街，恰遙遙相對，前幾天伊曾到我這裏來，據說我前後所實演的影片，伊一一給我記着，在這兩年之間，已主演了八部巨片了。伊又對我說「你這種成績，已超過了一般成人的明星，秀蘭，你真是一位健將呀！」</p>
<p>如今我要和你說些表演得經騐了。這實在不算怎樣困難的事情，比了讀書寫字或做算術，要容易得多。這好像是一種裝假作為的把戲，在我看來，要算是世界上最容易玩的把戲了。你可還記得我先前曾對你說過，我慣常踏着三輪自由車</p>
<p>到園子盡頭處的有加利樹下，就假做是一路上支加哥去嗎？更知我一面在假做，一面却不妨自信是實有其事過了些時候，你自會不覺得有什麽真假之分了。你在影片中的表演，也是如此，譬如你假做不是秀蘭鄧波兒，而是一位小將軍或是一個別的女孩子，你只須忘却了自己，假的做得像真的，一會兒你就會不覺得自己是在假做，而是一位小將軍，或一個別的女孩子了。</p>
<p>據我想來，這是任何人都會做的。即使我不是在主演一部影片，而自己在玩着假做的把戲，也未曾不可。從我的平屋的小走廊下望出去，可以瞧見攝影場街道的盡頭處，有一艘大輪船，其實並不是真的輪船，完全是假的，那邊也並沒有什麽河或海，連一滴水都沒有。他們在攝製影片時，有時用得着它，你在銀幕上，簡直和真的一模一樣。老實和你說，這輪船只有前面可瞧見的一個平面的船身，後面却一無所有。我常常立在那裏，假做是搭着這輪船，遠遠的到各處旅行去。呀，假做一切真是最好玩的把戲呀！」</p>

<p>初夏的時候，我們可以在池沼中，聽到一種閣閣的聲音，這就是幫助農夫除害蟲的青蛙叫聲了。</p>
<p>它在冬天，長眠地下，不食不動，春天到來，它們才到池沼裏去交尾配合，雌雄雙方都發出厲害的叫聲，雄蛙因有氣囊，閣閣閣的叫聲還要大，雌蛙產卵後，即離開池沼，到陸地上去生活，產下的卵不久就浮到水面，呈一種膠質狀的結晶體，數目大約有一千到兩千個，每個都藏在膠狀物中。</p>
<p>過了不久，圓形的卵就變化了，便可看出未來蝌蚪的軀幹，後來再看它生出尾巴來，然後脫離膠狀物而成為蝌蚪，從卵到蝌蚪經過兩星期，蝌蚪沒有生嘴的時候，仍舊卵上的食料來維持生命，蝌蚪漸漸生了嘴，就用植物當食料，並且能到處游泳。</p>
<p>蝌蚪先由鰓呼吸，後來就生肺替代，那時的蝌蚪就常常浮到水面上來呼吸空氣了，再後逐漸生長四肢，後腿先長，前腿後長，這時蝌蚪仍有尾巴，奇怪得很，蝌蚪不得到外來的食物，便把自己的尾巴吃掉了，這樣腿子變大，成為完全的蛙，離開池沼，過他的陸地生活。</p>

<p>小朋友們，廿九年度的暑期來臨了！我想這種希望能使你們在煩重的考試中得到一些安慰；你們一定連想到怎樣的暢玩這二月有餘的假期。可是希望你們在未解決這念頭之前，先考慮一下，今年所得到的舉識和成績是否使你們滿意。我相信學識是無窮盡的，所以每個人一定都感到不夠，尤其是我們，在這時代中。</p>
<p>用作休息用的暑期，他佔有了整個年的長的時間；用時作單位來算算，也很長了；約有一千六百多小時。就是照工作時間來算，也要六百多小時。這樣長的時間，糊糊塗塗的被他逃走，也未免太可惜了！尤其是我們學生，更覺得可惜了，假設我們用作研究或溫習功課，那一定對於學業的進步是很見成效的；也就能打定了下學期學業的基礎。反之，祗知遊玩式的來消磨時間；無疑的，下學期一定沒有好成績。這好似古諺所說：「溫故知新」「不進則退」。</p>
<p>小朋友們，希望你們記得那「在困難中博得偉大的成功」的一句話。用堅苦的精神爭得我們畢業上的成功。</p>

<p>A war cloud has engulfed the entire Balkans. Yesterday, the Hungarian government announced it would strengthen its border defenses and has greatly increased troops on the Romanian border. Meanwhile, Romanian sources claimed last night that Romania will resort to force before ceding territory to Hungary and Bulgaria. Referring to the Romanian mobilization, they stated, "This is Romania's response to the demands of Hungary and Bulgaria." (June 29, Associated Press)</p>
<p>Following the Soviet Union's ultimatum demanding the cession of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina, the Romanian government in Bucharest began a full mobilization of its army, navy, and air force at midnight. The parliament has authorized the government to requisition property, and a nationwide moratorium on payments has been declared. (June 29, Reuters)</p>
<p>Due to Romania's mobilization, Hungary in Budapest has also moved a large number of troops to the border. This move is generally believed to be Hungary's firm desire to reclaim Outer Transylvania, annexed by Romania on December 1, 1918. (June 29, Associated Press)</p>
<p>The Romanian government in Bucharest ordered a full mobilization of its army, navy, and air force at midnight last night. Romania is anxiously awaiting territorial demands from Bulgaria and Hungary. The government is taking emergency military and political measures to address Hungary and Bulgaria's demands to partition Romania. Diplomatic circles have learned that the Soviet Union has notified Hungary that it is prepared to seize Carpathian Ukraine "and place it under its protection." Unofficial sources say that a cabinet meeting was held late last night in Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria. Romanian political circles are greatly worried about this news, fearing that Bulgaria will demand the southern part of Dobruja province. According to sources in Sofia received by political circles here, the Bulgarian Foreign Minister met with the Italian and German ambassadors yesterday and informed them that Bulgaria should reclaim southern Dobruja province, as it was ceded to Romania after the Second Balkan War in 1913. News from Budapest also indicates that Hungary is preparing to make a formal demand to Romania. (June 29, Associated Press)</p>
<p>The German, Italian, and Soviet ambassadors to Bulgaria in Sofia visited the Bulgarian Foreign Minister yesterday to discuss Bulgaria's demands on Romania. The content of the talks was not announced. The Bulgarian cabinet met last night at 9:00 PM and has not yet adjourned. Some military experts have been called into service, but the Bulgarian army has not been mobilized. (June 19, Associated Press)</p>

<p>Rome. According to a diplomatic correspondent for the Italian Stefani News Agency, responsible parties here have advised Hungary and Bulgaria to be patient and not rush to make demands on Romania, as these demands can be achieved peacefully when the time is right. Italy's sympathy for Hungary and Bulgaria remains unchanged. Italy and Germany are both</p>
<p>Three Powers Dividing Spheres of Influence in Southeast Europe</p>
<p>Berlin. According to well-informed sources within the National Socialist Party last night, Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union have reached an understanding regarding their respective spheres of influence in Southeast Europe. This understanding applies to all parts of Europe east of Vienna. Slovakia is considered to be within Germany's sphere of influence. The three countries recognize that the Soviet Union's sphere of influence in Southeast Europe is largely territorial, while Germany and Italy's spheres of influence are primarily economic. (June 29, Associated Press)</p>
<p>Berlin. A German government spokesman told reporters yesterday that there was no basis for rumors that Germany, the Soviet Union, and Italy would hold a Balkan conference. Regarding Germany's attitude toward the change of government in Romania, the spokesman stated that this change was Romania's problem and had nothing to do with Germany. He continued that the German people had not yet received detailed information about the situation in Romania. (June 29, Haitong News Agency)</p>
<p>Turkey Takes Precautions, Strengthens Black Sea Defenses</p>
<p>Istanbul. Turkish troops began moving heavy artillery to Turkey's northern border yesterday. Officials are anxiously watching the situation in the Balkans. Authoritative sources say Turkey has also increased troops in Thrace from Anatolia. The Turkish fleet was moved to the Black Sea on Thursday but remained in the Bosphorus Strait yesterday. After General Mittelhauser, commander-in-chief of the French forces in the Near East, declared that his troops had ceased hostilities in accordance with the armistice agreement signed by the Bordeaux government with Germany, it is believed that Turkey will take rapid action. Turkish officials believe that the seriousness of the war extending to the Near East has decreased, but they point out that Turkey should consider its future and does not want to see Germany or Italy have mandate rights in Syria. Officials acknowledge that Turkey therefore needs to increase its defenses on the Syrian border as a precaution. (June 29, Associated Press)</p>
<p>Ankara. Turkish political figures have stated that the situation in Romania does not affect Turkey and does not involve the obligations stipulated in the Anglo-French-Turkish mutual assistance pact, as the "Soviet clause" stipulates that Turkey is relieved of its obligations under this pact if fulfilling it leads to a Soviet-Turkish conflict. Turkish government officials emphasized that German diplomats in the Balkans are making every effort to localize the dispute. It is said that Turkey hopes that the situation in Romania can develop peacefully and avoid unrest in the Balkan Peninsula. (June 29, Haitong News Agency)</p>
<p>Red Army Recovers Lost Territory: Soviet Union Rejoices</p>
<p>Moscow. At 2:00 PM yesterday, Soviet troops crossed the borders of Northern Bukovina and Bessarabia. Red Army tanks and motorized infantry have entered the cities of Cernăuți, Săveni, Bălți, Chișinău, Bender, and Akkerman. The Soviet troops are advancing smoothly according to plan, with no unexpected incidents. In all cities, the people warmly welcomed the Red Army with flowers, shouting slogans such as "Long live Soviet Bessarabia! Long live the Soviet Union!" (June 29, TASS)</p>
<p>Moscow. Since the peaceful resolution of the Soviet-Romanian dispute, the people of the Soviet Union have unanimously expressed their celebration, and mass rallies have been held everywhere. (June 29, TASS)</p>
<p>Bucharest. Yesterday afternoon, Soviet troops entered Romanian territory in three columns, while the Romanian troops in the handed-over areas were withdrawing. A moratorium on cash payments is now in effect throughout Romania. Officials have begun to move money and files out of Bessarabia. Civilians are leaving the country by train in succession. All public entertainment venues have been closed for three days. (June 29, Reuters)</p>
<p>London. The first stage of the forced return of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina to the Soviet Union has now been completed. The Red Army has occupied Cernăuți, the capital of Bukovina, and Chișinău, an important city in Bessarabia, as well as the fortified city of Albacet near the Dniester River in Bessarabia. Romania requested a meeting to discuss the Soviet demands. The Soviet side replied that the Soviet Union wanted to occupy the land it demanded first and then discuss the details. Therefore, yesterday, Red Army mechanized units and infantry, covered by aircraft, crossed the Romanian border. There were minor clashes with the Romanian army during the occupation, as the Romanian army had not yet received orders to retreat without fighting. Moscow Radio broadcast last night that Romania had ceded Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina to the Soviet Union in accordance with Soviet demands. The Soviet Union has given Romania four days to withdraw its troops and officials. It is reported that the Romanian government has sent another note to Moscow requesting guarantees for the safe withdrawal of Romanian civil and military officials in the occupied areas and the return of state property in the area.

<p>Beirut. General Mittelhauser, commander-in-chief of the French forces in Syria, and Mr. Puaux, the French High Commissioner in Syria, have issued a declaration stating that the armistice conditions signed by France do not change the situation in the mandated territories. Therefore, they have ordered a ceasefire. The French flag will continue to fly, and France will continue its mission in the Near East. It is reported that the French administrative agencies in the two mandated territories of Syria and Lebanon will continue to operate as usual, and French troops will remain stationed there. Its relationship with Palestine will not be greatly affected, and British trade with Syria is expected to continue as usual. As the alternative French government was being established, Syria had shifted from the excitement of advocating continued struggle to the understanding of the need to cooperate with the Bordeaux government. However, many French public offices in Syria are undoubtedly deeply disappointed by the change in circumstances. The frustration felt in Syria due to the armistice conditions will be somewhat relieved by General Mittelhauser's announcement that the French flag will continue to fly there. Furthermore, the fact that the French flag flies there will reassure Palestine, Turkey, and the general Arab population. (June 29, Reuters)</p>

<h3 id="e6">The Romanian Crisis and the European Situation <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Another new development in the European situation: the Soviet Union sent troops to begin occupying northern Romania the day before yesterday. One or two days earlier, the Soviet Union had twice demanded that Romania cede Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina; by noon on the 28th, its advance units had passed through the Romanian border and reached their intended locations. Meanwhile, according to foreign reports, Hungary has also demanded that Romania cede Transylvania, and Bulgaria is taking active steps to recover Dobruja. The Balkan Peninsula has always been known as the volcano of Europe. Ten months have passed since the outbreak of this war, and the Balkans, like scorched skin, has not yet erupted in volcanic activity; this is precisely because international competition is overly complex, with deep mutual restraints, and has instead been fortunate enough to obtain temporary peace. However, the surfacing of the Soviet-Romanian issue is nothing short of a serious warning sign. Now that the Soviet Union and Romania have designated representatives to hold negotiations in Odessa to handle the handover of territory, it is difficult to predict whether it will be resolved smoothly in the future, or whether complications will arise; and the future development of Hungary and Bulgaria's negotiations with Romania is also unknown. But no matter what, it can be said with certainty that the current Romanian crisis will seriously affect the future European situation.</p>
<p>Currently, there are four problem areas in Romanian territory: (1) Bessarabia, located in northeastern Romania, between the Prut and Dniester rivers, was ceded to Russia by Turkey in 1812. The local population is about three million, of which Romanians, Ukrainians, and Russians each account for about one-third. Therefore, during the last European war, that is, in 1917, after the Russian Revolution, Romania annexed Bessarabia. This annexation was subsequently recognized by Britain, France, and Italy in 1922, 1924, and 1927, but the Soviet Union never agreed to it. (2) Bukovina, located in northern Romania, originally belonged to Austria, and was ceded to Romania after the last European war; the population is about 900,000, of which half are Little Russians, mostly concentrated in the north, and one-third are Romanians. (3) Transylvania, located in the northwestern corner of Romania, originally belonged to Hungary and was obtained by Romania after World War I; the population is about three million, half of whom are Romanians and one-third are Hungarians; the former mostly belong to the Greek Orthodox Church, and the latter mostly belong to the Roman Catholic Church; because of their different beliefs and ethnic groups, coupled with the higher culture of the Hungarians, they are very reluctant to be ruled by Romania, so disputes often arise. (4) Dobruja, located in southeastern Romania, part of which was acquired by Romania in 1878, and the southernmost part was seized from Bulgaria in 1913, so almost all the residents of southern Dobruja are Bulgarians, and its instability is conceivable.</p>
<p>From the above simple historical review, we can roughly understand the complexity of the contents of these four issues; the rights and wrongs of these disputes are really difficult to assert. Romania also knows the difficulty of its own situation, so in 1922, it signed treaties of friendship with Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia, known as the Little Entente; and in 1934, it united with Greece, Turkey, and Yugoslavia to form the Balkan Entente to consolidate its national position; it also adopted a policy of compromise with Britain, France, and Germany, showing goodwill in many ways to seek security. However, its internal affairs have been quite chaotic for many years, and the national situation has not improved; busy all year round, eagerly seeking international buffering, now at the critical moment, it is ultimately inevitable to be at the mercy of others. This is the fate of Romania today, which on the one hand deserves sympathy, and on the other hand is quite thought-provoking.</p>
<p>One thing that has become very clear as a result of the development of the Romanian crisis is that after the Soviet Union occupied Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina, the Soviet Union's strategic position in Europe became stronger. In the past, the Soviet Union's acquisition of eastern Poland, subjugation of Finland, and stationing of troops in Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia strengthened its right wing; and now the occupation of northern Romania has strengthened its left wing; not only that, but it also laid the foundation for opening up the Black Sea gateway and obtaining a more advanced base in the future. Among the major European powers recently, France has been defeated, and Germany, Italy, and Britain are actively preparing for a major national war; while the Soviet Union is avoiding being drawn into the whirlpool of war on the one hand, and stepping up strengthening its national defense position on the other. Expanding in many ways, its scope is not limited to Europe; for example, the sea and air routes and land transportation in the Arctic region and Siberia have recently made great strides; according to a survey in this month's American "Asia" magazine, the Soviet Union has established thirteen air force bases from Vladivostok to Kamchatka, with at least one thousand aircraft stationed there. Its hypothetical enemy must be Japan. From this, it can be known that if one says that the Soviet Union will abandon the Far East and ignore it because of its development of power in southeastern Europe, as propagated by Japan, it is a distorted observation, a self-deceiving consolation. At the same time, the Soviet Union's southward advance to the Black Sea, although it had the tacit consent of Germany and Italy beforehand, international grievances and grudges often grow secretly and evolve in the dark due to time and events, and the competition for closeness and distance develops in both positive and negative directions. If the crisis that Romania has encountered in the past three or four days is regarded as the honor or disgrace of Romania alone, the rise or fall of a country, that is the superficial problem, and also a one-dimensional observation; if this is regarded as the dispute between Romania and the Soviet Union, Hungary, and Bulgaria, it is still not enough; if the so-called tacit understanding is regarded as sincere and harmonious, it is too generous, you must know that what Romania is encountering is precisely the various developments in the future between the Soviet Union and Germany, Italy, and with Britain and Turkey, please watch carefully with this subtle opportunity.</p>

It has not been announced whether the British forces were naval or air forces. (June 29, Reuters)</p>

<p>Rome. Mussolini has ordered all public institutions across the country to fly their flags at half-mast tomorrow and Sunday in mourning for the fallen General Balbo. Fascist party headquarters and Fascist groups will cover their party emblems in black cloth. (June 29, Reuters)</p>
<p>Brief Biography of Balbo</p>
<p>General Balbo was born in 1896 and is now 44 years old. He came from a humble background. At the beginning of the last World War, he joined the volunteer corps as a soldier. He was later transferred to the Alps and promoted to lieutenant for his meritorious service. After the war ended, he participated in D'Annunzio's Fiume expedition and occupied the city. He then went to Florence and passed the bar exam many times. At that time, he was still opposed to the Fascist Party, but was persuaded by Mussolini to join. Shortly before the Fascist Party's march on Rome, he was appointed commander of the Blackshirt militia, which at that time had only a few thousand members. After Mussolini took power, he ordered Balbo to reorganize the air force. At that time, the strength of the Italian air force was minimal. Before long, he was appointed Undersecretary of Aviation, a position previously held by Mussolini himself. Balbo formed a new aviation department and modernized everything. Balbo himself was very frugal and led by example. All employees took the same simple lunch in the middle of the day, and alcohol consumption was regulated and not allowed to be exceeded. In December 1930, he led twelve air force planes across the Atlantic Ocean to South America, for which he received the Aviation Bravery Gold Medal. In May 1932, the Chairman held the International Atlantic Aviator Conference in Rome to discuss the possibility of regular transatlantic aviation services. In the summer of 1933, he led twenty-four seaplanes for the second time from Italy, via Iceland, Newfoundland, and Canada, to Chicago in the United States, and then returned home via the Azores. It is a pity that one plane crashed in Amsterdam and another in the Azores, a flaw in this great undertaking. Not long after returning home, he was promoted to General in recognition of his merits. In November 1933, he resigned from his position as Minister of Aviation and was immediately appointed Governor of Libya. Balbo, like Mussolini, was decisive in his actions and strict with himself, and was a major figure in Italy. It is said that he only slept eight hours a night. Balbo strongly advocated building heavier-than-air aircraft and vehemently opposed airships, believing that airships had no great future. (Reuters)</p>

<p>"On June 26th, the Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars of the Soviet Union, Molotov, sent the following ultimatum to the Romanian envoy to the Soviet Union, Davidescu: In 1918, Romania, taking advantage of the weakness of Russia's military forces, seized a part of the Soviet territory—Bessarabia—thereby disrupting the relationship between the Ukrainian Soviet Republic and Bessarabia (Bessarabia is largely populated by Ukrainians). The Soviet Union has never agreed to the seizure of Bessarabia. The Soviet Union has repeatedly made strong statements to the world on this matter. Now that the weakness of the Soviet Union's military forces has become a thing of the past, and the current international situation compels us to promptly resolve all outstanding issues from the past, in order to lay the foundation for lasting peace, the Soviet Union believes that it is necessary to negotiate with Romania to demand the return of Bessarabia and the transfer of Bukovina, which are closely linked. This is because the majority of the population of the latter, in terms of both language and composition, is connected to Soviet Ukraine. This action is extremely just, as the return of Northern Bukovina to the Soviet Union would partly compensate for the losses suffered by the Soviet Union due to Romania's rule over Bessarabia for twenty-two years. The Soviet government has now proposed the following suggestions to the Romanian government: (1) Return Bessarabia to the Soviet Union. (2) Transfer Northern Bukovina to the Soviet Union (the boundary line should be based on the attached map). The Soviet government sincerely hopes that the Romanian government can accept these suggestions, thereby resolving the dispute between the two countries peacefully. On June 27th, the Soviet government awaited Romania's response.</p>
<p>On June 27th, Romanian envoy Davidescu delivered the Romanian government's response to Molotov. The response stated: "The Romanian government shares the same desire as your country for a peaceful resolution to the dispute. At the same time, it deems your government's suggestions appropriate and is prepared to begin friendly discussions with your country. Please indicate the location for negotiations. Upon receiving your government's response, we will immediately dispatch representatives to consult and hope that the outcome of the discussions will further strengthen the friendly relations between the two countries."</p>
<p>As to whether the Romanian government accepted the Soviet proposal, Molotov questioned envoy Davidescu. According to the reply, the Romanian government has accepted it. Regarding this matter, Molotov delivered the Soviet government's reply to Davidescu yesterday. The reply stated: "The Soviet government considers the Romanian government's reply on the 27th to be extremely vague. In that reply, the Romanian government did not directly state whether it accepted the Soviet proposal, especially the return of Bessarabia to the Soviet Union and the transfer of Northern Bukovina to the Soviet Union. However, Davidescu stated that the Romanian government had expressed its agreement in the reply. Therefore, the Soviet government made the following suggestions to Romania:</p>
<p>(1) Within four days (starting from 2 PM Moscow time on the 28th), Romanian troops should withdraw from Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina. (2) Within the same time frame, Soviet troops will occupy Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina. (3) On June 28th, Soviet troops will occupy Cernăuţi, Chișinău, and Akkerman. (4) The Romanian government shall be fully responsible for protecting railways, trains, bridges, warehouses, airports, industrial facilities, power plants, telegraph communications, etc., and shall not allow anyone to damage them. (5) A committee composed of representatives from the Soviet and Romanian governments (two from each side) will resolve issues related to the withdrawal of Romanian troops and Romanian institutions from Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina.</p>
<p>Regarding the above suggestions, the Soviet government stated that Romania must respond by noon on the 28th. At 11 AM on the 28th, envoy Davidescu delivered the Romanian government's reply to Molotov. The reply stated: "In order to avoid causing war in Europe and serious consequences, the Romanian government believes it is necessary to accept the withdrawal proposal. However, the Romanian government sincerely hopes that the deadlines in the first and second proposals can be extended, as heavy rain has disrupted transportation, making it impossible for Romanian troops to withdraw within four days. The committee established according to the fifth proposal can discuss this issue. The list of Romanian representatives will be delivered today. Thus, the Romanian government has accepted the Soviet proposal to return Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina." Molotov immediately informed the Romanian envoy that the Soviet government had appointed Kotulov and Popov, who are prepared to depart immediately with the Romanian representatives to Odessa to begin work. Molotov also told the Romanian envoy that if the facts require it, the Soviet-Romanian committee could postpone the implementation deadlines in the first and second proposals of the Soviet Union on the 27th for a few hours. The Romanian envoy was also asked to immediately notify the Soviet government of the list of Romanian representatives on the Soviet-Romanian committee. Soviet troops are scheduled to cross the Romanian border at 2 PM on the 28th and occupy the three cities of Hotin, Cernăuţi, and Akkerman." (TASS dispatch on the 28th)</p>

<p>Hong Kong - According to a government gazette released this afternoon, the government has decided to forcibly evacuate European women and children. This evacuation will be completed by July 5th. Except for women without children who are registered as nurses, no exceptions will be made. All evacuees will first go to Manila, or may be transferred elsewhere. It is reported that the Australian government has offered cooperation and is willing to accept some refugees. Efforts are currently being made to provide financial and other assistance when needed. At the same time, the authorities here are also working on plans for the evacuation of women and children from other communities and will implement them as soon as possible. (Reuters, 29th)</p>

The Japanese forces are in a position to take other actions if necessary. (Reuters, 29th)</p>
<p>Britain to Reject Japanese Demands</p>
<p>Hong Kong - The Hong Kong government has today ordered the forced evacuation of British women and children in Hong Kong to Manila this week, and ordered that this evacuation of British women and children must be completed by July 5th. All British women and children in Hong Kong have now received notifications from the authorities to prepare to depart upon order. The Hong Kong government stated that after arriving in Manila, the British women and children will be transferred to Australia. Earlier, the Hong Kong government issued an order declaring a state of emergency, and due to the continued existence of dangerous conditions, it issued an order under the Emergency Regulations authorizing the police to order all women and children, and others not needed for the protection of the colony, to prepare to leave Hong Kong. The order also canceled weekly holidays. It is reported that the American mail ship President Coolidge will load American women and children and sail to Manila at 2 AM on Sunday morning. All military families have been ordered to prepare to leave Hong Kong at 7 AM on Monday morning. Each adult is allowed to bring two large suitcases, and each child is allowed to bring two travel handbags. The authorities also notified everyone to bring warm clothing, as the trip to Manila is only the first step of the evacuation, and they may be moved elsewhere in the future. According to unofficial sources, the first group of evacuees will be over 600 people. It is also reported that there has been a large number of depositors withdrawing funds from Chinese and foreign banks in Hong Kong this morning, mostly Chinese. Many Chinese people want to take the opportunity to withdraw their deposits and return to the mainland before Hong Kong is completely blockaded. Although some Europeans, who have barely recovered from last year's evacuation panic, are showing extreme anxiety, most of the population is not panicked. Military officials say that the border is as calm as usual today, while Chinese sources say that more Japanese troops have continued to arrive in Nantou and Shatoujiao. The Hong Kong Telegraph said that the Hong Kong government held a meeting this morning and is currently discussing the situation. A statement is expected to be released this afternoon. Well-informed sources believe that this statement will include the mobilization of volunteer troops. Although the merchant ships have not yet received orders to sail, foreigners in Hong Kong may be evacuated within six hours of receiving notification. The number of people preparing to evacuate has reached 3,000, including 200 American citizens. The American consulate has recently moved and has fully reported the situation here to the US State Department, but has not yet received instructions from Washington. There are 1,000 American citizens registered at the American consulate, but most are Chinese and Filipinos born in the United States. The consulate said that if the situation becomes urgent, 200 American citizens will be evacuated. (According to reports from Manila today, the Red Cross there has set up a refugee camp that can accommodate 5,000 refugees, ready to accommodate refugees from Hong Kong, and the US Army will also cooperate with the Red Cross and use barracks to house the refugees.) The Hong Kong authorities continue to urge residents not to panic, saying that there is no reason to panic simply because of Japan's blockade. Some believe that because the preparation for the evacuation of residents in Hong Kong was ordered by London, Britain will reject Japan's demand to blockade the Burma Road. The Hong Kong authorities have actually been preparing for the evacuation of residents for some time. Women and children have already been vaccinated, and the husbands have prepared travel expenses for their wives. They are only waiting for notification to depart. The evacuation is limited to Europeans. Military families will be evacuated first, including children under the age of four. However, many women will remain here to perform war work.

<p>Japan Claims to Have Revoked the Anglo-Japanese Agreement</p>
<p>Guangzhou - According to Japanese sources, a spokesman for the Japanese forces in South China recently claimed that the Japanese army has revoked the agreement concluded with Britain in November 1938. According to that agreement, the Japanese army must notify the British authorities 24 hours in advance of any military operations on the Hong Kong and Kowloon border. The spokesman accused Britain of not complying with the agreement, and therefore the Japanese army has taken this action. (United Press, 29th)</p>
<p>Hong Kong - A Hong Kong military spokesman recently denied the Japanese army's accusation that the British military authorities did not comply with the Anglo-Japanese agreement of November 1938. According to that agreement, the Japanese army should notify the British side 24 hours in advance of any military operations in Hong Kong and Kowloon. However, today a spokesman for the Japanese army in Guangzhou said that the agreement has been revoked because the Japanese army found that Britain did not comply with the agreement in Bao'an, reporting military information to the Chinese side. According to the British military spokesman, no protest has been received from the Japanese side regarding this matter, and Britain has always respected the agreement. (United Press, 29th)</p>

<p>Kunming - According to well-informed sources here, the government of French Indochina recently sent a high-ranking official here, reportedly on a mission to Chongqing to explain to the Chinese government the details of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway ban in order to avoid misunderstandings. The official made a statement to all sectors yesterday, saying that the rumors that the government of French Indochina had surrendered to Japan and that Japan had sent many inspectors to Vietnam to monitor freight transport were completely untrue. Governor-General Catroux of Vietnam only acted as an intermediary to "relay [the request] to the French government" when it received a request from the Japanese side. Bordeaux has not yet replied, and Admiral Decoux has been appointed to succeed Catroux. Therefore, it is too early to talk about a Franco-Japanese compromise. The official also joked that a few days ago, it was said that Japanese inspectors in Tokyo had "taken a plane" to Hanoi to take up "their positions," but so far, there has been no news of their arrival, nor have there been any reports of plane crashes. It can be seen that all the rumors about the Vietnamese authorities surrendering are purely Japanese propaganda tactics. (Express News Agency, 29th)</p>

<h3 id="e25">Japanese Foreign Minister Announces Unilateral Domination Policy in East Asia, South Seas Region Also Considered a Possession; Warns Powers Not to Interfere in Far East Affairs <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, today, Foreign Minister Arita delivered a radio address, reiterating Japan's non-involvement in the European war vortex, warning all foreign powers not to interfere in East Asia, declaring Japan's determination to eliminate all activities aiding General Chiang Kai-shek, and suggesting that the world be divided into regions for coexistence and co-prosperity. He stated that he hoped Western powers would not take any unnecessary actions that would affect the stability of East Asia. The fate of East Asia, including the South Seas region, and any developments or handling thereof, are of grave concern to Japan, as Japan bears the mission and responsibility of stabilizing East Asia. Since its establishment, Japan's concept has been that all countries should be able to find a proper place for themselves in the world. Our foreign policy is based on this concept. Therefore, we have sometimes risked the survival of the nation without hesitation. Although all mankind seeks to firmly establish world peace, it is not mentioned that this goal can only be achieved after all countries have obtained their rightful position. In the current stage of human progress, the establishment of world peace in this sense is difficult to achieve. Therefore, to realize this great concept, people who are mutually related geographically, racially, culturally, and economically should naturally form their own regions for coexistence and co-prosperity, and establish peace and order within this scope. At the same time, they should establish relations with other regions to live and prosper together. The cause of the struggles that mankind has experienced so far lies in the lack of adequate consideration for this natural and constructive need for world order, and the remedy of old irrationalities and injustices. The current European war further proves this. Therefore, to establish international peace on a permanent basis, various efforts must be made to correct all errors. Japan's current undertaking to build a "New Order in East Asia" is based on this spirit. We have repeatedly urged those who not only do not understand this great responsibility but also aid Chiang Kai-shek to obstruct the construction of the "New Order in East Asia" to reconsider their attitude. We still want to urge them to seriously reflect. We are determined to do everything in our power to eliminate all activities that aid Chiang. There are now those who, regardless of the reason, do not approve of changing the status quo by force. Japan's three years of war in China are aimed at promoting just and lasting peace. Japan's use of force is a preemptive action. The countries of East Asia and the regions of the South Seas are geographically, historically, racially, and economically closely related to each other. It is my opinion that all of the above regions should be united into a single region on the basis of common survival, and thereby ensure the security of the entire region. This is a natural result. When the current European war broke out, the Japanese government immediately announced a policy of non-involvement in the war vortex, and stated that Japan did not intend to interfere in the European situation, nor did it want the war to spread to East Asia. Japan's hope that Western powers would not take any unnecessary actions that would affect East Asia is entirely natural. While Japan is working hard to build its "New Order in East Asia," it is still paying close attention to the progress of the European war and its repercussions in all aspects of East Asia, including the South Seas. It is appropriate to declare that the fate of the aforementioned regions, and any developments or handling thereof, are of grave concern to Japan, as Japan bears the mission and responsibility of stabilizing East Asia.

<p>Tokyo, according to Miyako Shimbun, Foreign Minister Arita notified British Ambassador Craigie yesterday afternoon that if the British side does not respond to Japan's demand to stop the transportation of goods from Burma and Hong Kong to China soon, Japan may take what it considers to be appropriate measures. Asahi Shimbun reported that when British Ambassador Craigie met with Foreign Minister Arita yesterday, he stated that Japan's request required very full consideration, and that the main supporters of the government led by General Chiang Kai-shek were the United States and the Soviet Union, not Britain, and that Japan should protest to these two countries. The Japanese side obviously cannot regard this ambiguous reply as satisfactory.

<p>Tokyo, various newspapers believe that the statement issued by the Foreign Ministry spokesman last night, stating that the Netherlands and the Netherlands East Indies governments have both declared that they will not take any measures that would hinder the export of various major commodities needed by Japan from the Netherlands East Indies to Japan, and that they will comply with Japan's wishes, indicates that Japan and the Netherlands have reached a compromise on promoting trade between Japan and the Netherlands East Indies. Asahi Shimbun pointed out that Japan has sought to ensure the import of the required quantities of gasoline, tin, rubber, nickel ore, and other raw materials from the Netherlands East Indies, and the authorities of the archipelago have complied with Japan's request. As a result, Japanese Vice Foreign Minister Masayuki Tani and Dutch Minister Pabst began detailed negotiations yesterday afternoon to determine the quantity and value of goods to be exported from the Netherlands East Indies to Japan. According to the newspaper, in 1939, Japanese goods sold to the Netherlands East Indies were worth 137,802,000 yen, while those purchased from the Netherlands East Indies were worth 71,629,000 yen. The newspaper hopes that Japan's purchases from the Netherlands East Indies will increase significantly as a result of the current negotiations between the two countries.

<p>Philadelphia, the Republican National Convention yesterday elected Oregon Senator McNary as the vice-presidential candidate. Vice Willkie Republicans use the slogan for the 1940 candidate Willkie and McNary as peace preparation and prosperity. McNary is an old Republican leader. His election was unanimously supported by Hawaii and the Philippines. McNary has always been regarded as a moderate, not as outspoken as Willkie. He sympathizes with the Allies. He once opposed the revision of the Neutrality Act, but recently has not attacked President Roosevelt's foreign policy. (United Press dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>Philadelphia, it is reported that Republican presidential candidate Willkie is interested in Senate Minority Leader McNary as vice president, but McNary has expressed his unwillingness to be elected. McNary is currently 66 years old and has been a senator since 1917. (Reuters dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>Philadelphia, U.S. Senator McNary, known for his liberal ideas, originally announced that he did not want to be elected as the Republican vice presidential candidate, and then said that if forced to be elected, he would be willing to be elected. When the Republican Party first voted for the vice presidential candidate, McNary won as many as 890 votes. McNary was in Washington at the time, and immediately accepted the election after receiving a telephone report of the voting results. (Reuters dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>Willkie's Brief Speech</p>
<p>Philadelphia, before the Republican National Convention adjourned yesterday, Willkie gave a brief speech in public, clarifying his determination to uphold American policy. He said, "Democracy is now encountering a very serious test. We stand on the position of the American people and democracy, and should dedicate ourselves to America. This place is the last bastion of freedom. I, as candidate, hope very much to lead you in an aggressive and fighting way, to unite the Americas to defend freedom." (United Press dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>London, Londoners believe that Willkie's election as the Republican presidential candidate in the United States is a major blow to Hitler. Since the outbreak of the war, Nazi propaganda organs in the United States have tried their best to promote the policy of American isolation, but now they have encountered a serious setback. Britain is of course very happy to see that the Republican Party has elected Willkie, a candidate for president who supports the democracy of the Americas. (Reuters dispatch, 29th)</p>

<p>Berlin, the German Foreign Ministry released the fifth White Paper yesterday, titled "Archives of the Western Powers' Policy of Expanding the War," revealing the staff talks conducted by Britain, France, Belgium, and the Netherlands. It includes official documents from the four countries, all of which were seized by the German army during its advance. In addition to the original text, there is also a German translation for comparison. (Haitong dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>Berlin, the fifth German White Paper, which publishes orders from the military authorities of Britain, France, and Belgium, has proved that the Western European countries attempted to use Belgium and the Netherlands as bases for attacking German industrial areas, and had specified detailed plans with the staff departments of Belgium and the Netherlands. The orders published in the White Paper were issued between November last year and April this year, and have proven that the British and French headquarters had already made preparations. These orders mentioned the liaison between the British and French troops and the Belgian military headquarters, the issue of the French army's motorized units being supplied with gasoline by Belgium, and the date of the French army's stationing in Belgium. At the end of February, French soldiers were ordered to study the routes of advancing into Belgium. French officers also studied positions within Belgium. British and French troops had entered Belgium before May 10, that is, before the German advance. The orders of the Belgian military authorities mentioned the arrival of friendly troops, which were undoubtedly French troops. The invasion maps of Britain and France have proven the intention to attack Germany, and the fact that the Belgian staff department had approved this plan. The staff departments of Britain, France, and Belgium had closely cooperated and conducted negotiations before the German advance. Combining the various documents, the German White Paper reached two conclusions: (1) The staff departments of France and Belgium continued to discuss without interruption after the World War. The British and Belgian staff departments also cooperated in the same way. The German military headquarters had learned of this fact from various documents. The Belgian government did not conceal the fact that the Dutch government also had detailed agreements with Britain and France. (2) The documents seized by the German army in Belgium have proven that in September 1939, the staff departments of various countries had prepared a plan for British and French troops to attack the German Ruhr area through Belgium and the Netherlands, and the combat troops were also familiar with this plan. The German White Paper also published the British orders recently seized in Norway, proving that the British side's defense regarding the British military's actions in Norway was only a camouflage for the German military. On April 6, the British Admiralty issued an order to the expeditionary force in the direction of Narvik, announcing that the Swedish ore area was the target of British military action. This order did not mention that there were already German troops in Norway, and this order was issued before Britain advanced into Denmark or Norway. The Western European countries had used small and weak countries as tools from the beginning. The Nordic countries and the three countries of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg were successively subjected to infringement, and the German intervention prevented the Allied forces' plans from being realized.

<p>Washington, the U.S. Navy Department yesterday ordered another 19 new ships to be built and will start construction soon. At the same time, President Roosevelt indicated that the total amount of defense spending for 1941, originally set at 9 billion yuan, will be increased to 15 billion US dollars. According to the Navy Department, ten destroyers and nine submarines, worth US$154,575,000, will begin construction today. The cost will be paid from the US$750,000,000 supplementary funding signed by President Luo on Thursday. Five submarines will be built in Portsmouth, four will be built on Mare Island, five destroyers will be built in Boston, three will be built in Charlestown, and two will be built in Puget Sound. According to reliable sources, government designers are planning to expand the previously allocated US$5,082,310,080 to double it, so that the industry can have the greatest remaining power to expand its production. Some strategists admit that it is impossible to add a huge amount of weapons in this fiscal year. They hope that there will be large sums of money to ensure that the factories that are expanding are convinced that there is money to pay for the output next year and thereafter. President Luo hinted that he would ask for additional funds again, but he said that he does not know the amount yet. (International News Agency dispatch, 29th)</p>

<p>London, Britain has decided to recognize General de Gaulle, who recently organized the French National Committee in London to continue fighting against the Axis powers. An official statement was issued last night, claiming that the Fu government recognizes General de Gaulle as the leader of free French people everywhere, supporting Allied ideals. Gortell was the Minister of the Army in the Reynaud cabinet and was one of the French military leaders who predicted that Germany would use a large number of tanks and aircraft to launch a concentrated offensive. Since he organized the National Resistance Committee in England, French groups in various French territories have sent telegrams of support. (Reuters dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>London, a spokesman for General de Gaulle, the initiator of the French National Committee, recently stated that regardless of the attitude adopted by the French people in other parts of the world, General de Gaulle is determined to fulfill his promise to assist Britain in continuing the resistance. As for the French National Committee, it has been organized by General de Gaulle, but he does not want to establish a formal government outside of France, but only wants to serve as a liaison between the various parts of the French Empire and ensure that its activities can echo the activities of the British government. (Havas dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>London, General de Gaulle, the initiator of the French National Committee, recently gave a radio address, stating, "The British government has decided to recognize me as the leader of the free French who are resisting. This move is of profound significance. From now on, all free French compatriots can unite and continue to fight shoulder to shoulder with the allies." General de Gaulle has also taken various measures in accordance with the British government's decision to place the French people currently living in Britain and those who can come to Britain in the future under his leadership. He is also preparing to immediately recruit volunteers to form army and air force units to participate in the war. At the same time, he called on compatriots everywhere to rise up and resist. Regarding this point, his speech stated, "I hereby call on the governors and generals of the French Empire to contact me as soon as possible, so that we can gather our strength and fight for the motherland together."

<h3 id="e36">British Government Determined to Fight to the End; Internal Unity is Strong; Rumors Disappear Without Being Attacked <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>London, according to a semi-official statement released here, in the past two days, the German side has spread various rumors, saying that Britain is preparing to make peace with Germany, and that British Ambassador to Spain Hoare is seeking to make contact with Germany through the mediation of a certain royal person, and that Chamberlain is leading the Conservative Party to oppose Prime Minister Churchill in order to negotiate peace with Hitler. London officials in charge have denied these rumors particularly thoroughly. It is claimed that Hoare has not only never mentioned peace or ceasefire terms, but has also clearly stated Britain's determination to continue the struggle. The Conservative Party has also repeatedly and earnestly stated that under Chamberlain's leadership, it will wholeheartedly support the Prime Minister and the government's claim to fight for victory. The intention of the German side to spread these rumors can be seen from the time it chose to issue these rumors. When the American Republican Party held a convention, the German side made every effort to spread rumors. The purpose was nothing more than to make the American Republican Party believe that the Conservative Party would have actions to sell out the country, and that it would be futile to continue to assist Britain. The Republican Party could therefore adopt a policy of isolationism and elect a presidential candidate who advocates an isolationist policy. However, Willkie, who advocates aiding Britain, was finally nominated as the Republican presidential candidate, which shows that the German side's tricks have failed. This matter only shows that Germany is hesitant and worried about the difficulty of attacking the British Empire. (Reuters dispatch, 29th)</p>

<p>London, the evacuation of civilians from the Channel Islands is reported to have started a week ago. Although many people have gone to Britain, a large number of civilians have not yet been evacuated. According to internal announcements, enemy aircraft bombed the two islands of Jersey and Guernsey yesterday, causing material losses. Many civilians were strafed by machine guns. In Jersey, at least six people were killed and several were injured. In Guernsey, two to three people were killed and three to six people were injured. It is reported that enemy aircraft bombed Guernsey for a total of 50 minutes. The aircraft kept circling over the island, dropping explosive and incendiary bombs, and firing machine guns at civilians. An ambulance carrying the wounded to the hospital was destroyed by machine gun bullets and could not move. (Reuters dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>London, according to news from the British Home Office, since Germany has occupied the recent French territory of the Channel Islands, Britain has decided to remove the military equipment from the islands. All armed forces have been withdrawn. The Channel Islands are a number of small rocky islands located off the northwest coast of France, 90 and 100 miles south of Britain. The largest of them are Jersey and Guernsey. A certain military expert wrote that anyone familiar with the terrain should not be surprised by the British decision to disarm the Channel Islands. The islands are located within 30 miles of the French coast, with some islands even closer and within range of coastal artillery. The occupation of northern France has deprived the islands of any strategic value. In peacetime, the entire archipelago is garrisoned by only one regiment. Since the islands have no strategic use for either Britain or Germany, there is no need to continue to defend them, as this would only subject the residents to the unnecessary danger of German bombardment.

<p>British Ambassador to China, Dr. Archibald Clark Kerr, gave two broadcasts yesterday via the Gospel Radio Station, at 12:45 PM and 9:00 PM, appealing to British nationals in China for wartime donations. The full text of his speech is recorded below: "For several months, I have wanted to use wireless broadcasting to contact our nationals in China, but this wish has not been fulfilled. After returning to Shanghai, I deeply feel that contact with you is indispensable. What I want to say now is that during this difficult time, I, in my capacity as Ambassador, and the British authorities in China, are extremely concerned about all your difficulties and are willing to provide guidance when necessary.</p>
<p>Britain Willing to Face Any Difficulty</p>
<p>You have probably read the Prime Minister's recent speech. In an impassioned tone and with a courageous attitude, he explained the current environment in which our country finds itself. A few days ago, he stated in the House of Commons that Britain is prepared to face any difficulty. Now I would like to extract a few words: "We should move forward with a spirit of courage. Thousands of years from now, if the British Empire still exists, humanity will look back on today as the greatest period in history." These few grand words are sufficient to demonstrate the spirit of our nation today, so that the current struggle reaches the day of victory. All my fellow countrymen in China should regard it as a torch in the darkness and move forward accordingly.</p>
<p>Determination to Use Our Own Strength</p>
<p>It is undeniable that the crisis we face today is not without precedent in history. We are not isolated today. Around us, both before and behind, are the strong-willed people of the British Commonwealth of Nations. At the same time, we can deeply rely on the unlimited resources and assistance of the Empire and our allies. Therefore, at this moment, we should have confidence in our current cause, our own strength, and the determination to use this strength. We should not be disappointed. I hope that you can all use perseverance, determination, and courage to face this great era.</p>
<p>Suppress Emotions, Avoid Provocation</p>
<p>Here, I would like to tell you one thing. It may seem redundant to tell you, who are so clear-minded, but the country in which we reside, China, is a neutral country, especially Shanghai, which is an international city. We should exercise restraint and avoid provocative actions.</p>
<p>Reducing Food and Clothing is Not Enough</p>
<p>I am well aware that British nationals residing in China are willing to place their lives and property at the disposal of the country during this time. If we can reduce food and clothing, our contribution to the country would be considerable, but even this is not enough. I would like to briefly describe the plan I have devised:</p>
<p>Voluntary Donations to Replenish the National Treasury</p>
<p>After returning to Shanghai, I was deeply impressed by the enthusiastic spirit of British nationals who donated to the war effort. I firmly believe that this spirit is also fully expressed among British nationals throughout China. From my observation, what is currently lacking is the leadership to promote the realization of this spirit. I am now willing to take on this leadership responsibility and appeal to compatriots and businesses in China to make voluntary donations to replenish the national treasury. I know that you have been waiting for this action for a long time and will respond with enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Raise Large Sums First, Monthly Donations</p>
<p>We have now organized a small committee to carry out the following plan: raise large sums of money immediately, followed by monthly donations for wartime needs. Some have suggested that these donations should be compulsory, but I do not agree. In my personal opinion, all donations should be based on individual conscience and ability. To facilitate donations, small committees will be organized in Shanghai or other locations to provide guidance and to give appropriate consideration to the special circumstances and trade conditions in the Far East. In addition, we will negotiate with Chartered Banks to collect donations and issue receipts. In other locations where there are no British banks, donations can be handed over to the British Consulate for collection. These "Voluntary Wartime Donations" can be paid by check. The banks handling the donations should remit the actual amount received to the British government through Shanghai each month, with the consulates in various places responsible for the remittance. Detailed measures for this plan will be described in a separate letter.</p>
<p>Concrete Plans Are Underway</p>
<p>You are probably aware that there is already a wartime savings organization in Shanghai. We can invest in government funds with very small amounts. Since the outbreak of the war, the central wartime donation organizations in our country have already received huge amounts of donations for charitable purposes, such as the British Red Cross, and for the慰勞 of the troops. The details are not necessary to describe, but this work is slightly different from the plan I have proposed. I know that the majority of compatriots in China still feel that they have not been able to do their best for the country in their current positions. I have the same feeling and deep sympathy. In my previous broadcast, I said that their responsibility should be to continue to perform their respective duties. Now, I can say that concrete plans are underway. I hope that their doubts and hesitations will be eliminated as a result. I hope you will not misunderstand that the government ignores their ambitions and loyalty. In fact, in these troubled times, with so many things to be decided, the domestic authorities may not be able to take care of everything that we see as urgent. We should understand the difficulties of the authorities.</p>
<p>Embassy Cares for British Nationals Everywhere</p>
<p>Before ending the broadcast, I would like to solemnly declare again that this embassy and the consular authorities in various places are very willing to maintain close contact with British organizations in various places and provide as much assistance and guidance as possible. You have the autonomy to decide what to do, but in these extraordinary times, the authorities are also very concerned about your individual problems and are happy to provide assistance.</p>
<h3 id="e52">French Municipal Council's French Staff Distributes Savings to Aid Relatives in Home Country, but Difficulty in Remitting Causes Return of Funds <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>It was previously reported that the funds of the French Concession authorities had been transferred to the American Chase Bank. The French Municipal Council, fearing that it would be taken over by the Japanese, had begun liquidation. The council had already withdrawn and returned the employees' pension funds. At that time, the lack of clarity caused some psychological panic. Yesterday, Mr. Klausbai, chairman of the Provident Fund Committee of the French Municipal Council, strongly refuted this, calling it unfounded. He explained that what was returned was the employees' savings, deposited in the American Bank in the International Settlement, and managed by the Provident Fund Committee. The interest rate was very low, and it could not be used except in emergencies. Now, because the families of most of the 275 French employees are in Europe and are suffering terribly, the Provident Fund Committee decided to withdraw and return each person's savings, so that they could be sent back to Europe to help their families. The total amount returned was 4 million francs and 100,000 US dollars. However, it is heard that after the funds were returned, there were still difficulties in remitting them to France. Therefore, some employees, after receiving their deposits, returned them to the Provident Fund Committee to be kept in trust for continued management.</p>

<p>Since the French Pétain government made peace with Germany, some former members of the French government, such as Reynaud, who advocate continuing the war of resistance, will form another government in Britain. The British government has expressed deep regret for the Pétain government's capitulation to Germany. The British and French envoys in China continue to maintain close contact. According to a report by a reporter from the Pingming News Agency, who inquired with reliable sources in the diplomatic community in Shanghai yesterday, British Ambassador to China Sir Archibald Clark Kerr and French Ambassador to China Cosme are both currently in Shanghai. The British and French ambassadors have held several meetings. One of their recent meetings was two days ago, when French Ambassador Cosme visited British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr at the British Embassy's Shanghai office in Jardine Matheson Building on the Bund. It is known by informed sources in the diplomatic community in Shanghai that the British and French ambassadors to China are still continuing to cooperate and that the Far Eastern policies of the two countries remain consistent. As for the rumor that US Ambassador Johnson will come to Shanghai on a regular basis, reporters from the Buming News Agency repeatedly inquired with the US officials in Shanghai, and it was still said that as of yesterday, Shanghai had not received a definite date for the US Ambassador to leave Chongqing for Shanghai.</p>
<p>War Funds</p>
<p>The total amount of donations raised by the British War Fund in Shanghai has recently reached more than 891,000 yuan in legal tender and more than 17,760 British pounds. Recently raised funds include more than 2,300 yuan from Swire Company employees, 1,000 yuan from the Cohen couple, more than 1,150 yuan from the Xieqiao General Association, 3,000 yuan from the Cotton Trading Company, and 1,000 yuan from Jishi Brothers. According to a notice issued yesterday, under the name of charitable funds for the first half of this year (three months) of the Shanghai Race Club in Shanghai, a total of 124,391.33 yuan has been received. A total of 124,360 yuan has been spent, including 54,000 yuan for the British War Fund, 40,000 yuan for the Shanghai Joint Foreign Charitable Committee, 11,500 yuan for various charitable organizations, and 9,000 yuan for the British Sailors' Society.</p>

<h3 id="e54">French Municipal Council Declares Reasons for Increasing Taxes, Purely for Maintaining Security Within the Concession, It Is Reported that the Taxpayers' Association Will Continue to Negotiate <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>The increased taxes in the two concessions have been implemented since July 1st. The Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the French Concession has received a reply from the French Municipal Council stating, "In response to your letter of June 4th, which mentioned concerns about problems arising from the increased taxes by the Municipal Council due to the high prices of daily necessities, we have noted your concerns. (Omission)... The Council has reduced unnecessary expenses and has also reduced personnel in various departments while increasing working hours. Currently, the materials required by various departments have generally risen to 300%. Therefore, the house tax should be increased to 25%. However, in consideration of the difficulties of the residents within the concession, the Council has only resolved to increase the surtax on the house tax from 2% to 7% from July 1, 1940, to maintain the costs of the police and various departments of the Municipal Council in maintaining</p>
<p>security within the concession. Additional expenses will be covered by increasing the taxes on amusement venues (this type of increase has no noble impact on residents' lives) to make up for the shortfall. Since 1937, the police have increased personnel for the benefit of the residents within the concession as follows: 25 French police, 169 Russian police, 385 Vietnamese police, and 696 Chinese police. If taxes are reduced, police personnel will also be reduced accordingly,</p>
<p>which will affect security. Your Association should not oppose the tax increase on July 1st, as the surtax is quite appropriate and cannot be reduced any further." It is reported that the Taxpayers' Association of the French Concession will continue to negotiate, requesting a reduction or postponement of the implementation.</p>

<p>Cut Noodles Priced Today at 32 Cents Per Catty</p>
<p>In view of the rising rice prices, which are related to the security within the concession and the livelihood of civilians, the Bean and Rice Industry Association convened a temporary joint meeting with the Miscellaneous Grain and Oil Cake Industry Association at 3:00 PM yesterday at its headquarters on the third floor of No. 15 Avenue Edward VII to discuss concrete measures. A total of 18 people attended to discuss the entire food problem. Song Youchang, the representative who met with the authorities, reported on the meeting, saying that he met with Deputy Director Ho of the Public Concession Bureau some days ago. Mr. Ho personally received him and inquired about the recent rice market situation and discussed on the spot to convene a meeting immediately to maintain the food supply of the city,</p>
<p>including (1) how to increase stocks and register rice that has arrived or has not arrived, (2) agreeing on standard prices, and (3) preventing speculation in the market, and all goods must be sold in reality without raising prices on the pretext of lacking goods. Subsequently, the association resolved (A) that the miscellaneous grain market will be open from 9:00 AM (new time) to 12:00 PM during the summer heat from July 1st, and will be closed in the afternoon until the end of August, and (B) that rice industry groups related to buying, selling, and brokerage, and responsible personnel designated by the authorities of the two concessions will be invited to organize an</p>
<p>evaluation committee, which will be organized and handled after obtaining the consent of the concession authorities. The association also scheduled to send personnel to meet with the authorities again next Monday to report on the discussions of the industry. However, according to a report by a reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency to the rice industry in the city, Wan Xingyu of No. 14 Laoyongan Street said that he received a call from his counterparts in Hong Kong at 9:00 AM yesterday, saying that the Hong Kong authorities had recently ordered all shipping companies</p>
<p>to prohibit exports, so that ships that had already loaded rice were temporarily unable to leave port. The company immediately telegraphed to inquire whether Hong Kong had banned rice exports. As of 8:00 PM last night, it had not received a reply from Hong Kong. However, the market sentiment has recovered and strengthened. As for the sale of cheap flour, it has been agreed that (1) 79 households will be paid and distributed in two days, totaling 456 bags of flour, which can be purchased from Wanfeng Flour Number in Dongxinqiao, (2) 302 households will receive a total of 911 bags per day, which will be paid and distributed in four days, which can be purchased from Tongjulong Longshengchang Futai Tongfulu Changfengli Weng Xiaoji Yuanfeng Xiexin Fuju in Tianzhutang Street. The factory price is 15.3 yuan per bag, plus a handling fee, totaling 15.5 yuan per bag. The association's new members plan to ask the authorities for relief again. The price of cut noodles will be 32 cents per market catty from today.</p>
<h3 id="e56">After the Japanese Occupation of Xujiahui, the Area is Completely Changed <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>Japanese and Puppet Authorities Investigate Households; Many Factories and Shops have Relocated</p>
<p>Since the Xujiahui Refugee Zone was occupied, the local situation has been very chaotic. Yesterday, I drove to the area and inspected the situation along Pudong Road West, Ged Road, and Tianzhutang Road. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Stricter Security</p>
<p>The Japanese and puppet security line originally started from the barbed wire fence at Haige Road and Xujiahui Road. However, as of yesterday, it has been moved back to the Pu-Hui Tang Bridge, where Haige Road enters Xujiahui Road. Japanese soldiers and two puppet police officers guard the area. The fortress east of that location still flies the French flag. Furthermore, after more than a dozen robberies occurred in Xujiahui Town on the evening of June 26th, security was suddenly tightened. Yesterday, Ciyou Bridge and other locations on Pudong Road were patrolled by teams of puppet police officers, each consisting of one person. In addition, teams of puppet police officers led by two Japanese soldiers patrolled the area, searching pedestrians. As a result, there were very few pedestrians on the road. Yesterday, Japanese and Chinese special agents were in the Yude Road area of Pudong Road investigating households, forcing residents to obtain so-called "household registration certificates." Residents were at a loss, and the people were very panicked.</p>
<p>Migration Prohibited</p>
<p>Since the area was occupied and the local situation became chaotic, ordinary poor people were unable to move out. However, the slightly wealthier people moved to the concessions, especially shops and factories. For example, the Yiji Coal Company in Pudong and the Defeng Factory in Ged Road have closed their doors tightly. Although the Ciyunfang and Yongle Village on Pudong Road are newly built houses, most of the residents have moved elsewhere. Even the Chinese staff of the French church have moved out of the area. Therefore, the situation in Xujiahui is very bleak. It is said that a "sub-bureau" of the puppet "police station" has been established in the area. The puppet police station also posted a notice the other day prohibiting residents from moving elsewhere, otherwise they will be considered "spreading rumors and confusing the public." In addition, advertisements for gambling dens have been discovered, such as "Xing She," which are everywhere. It is said that these gambling dens are all located in Dongfahua Town.</p>
<h3 id="e57">Household Bread Saves 30,000 Yuan a Day <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>The maximum selling price of household bread is limited to 38 cents per pound. Since it was first sold on June 26th of this month, the results have been very good. There are a total of 40 bread factories in the Public Concession that produce this kind of cheap bread, and there are also this many in the French Concession. The Public Concession consumes 80,000 pounds of bread every day. According to the "household bread" price, it can save 15,000 yuan per day compared to the regular price. The French Concession's sales are also similar. Therefore, 30,000 yuan can be saved every day. Currently, several bread factories are selling household bread at prices that are several cents lower than the fixed price. A large-scale household bread market at the corner of Mai Gao Bao Lu Road in the French Concession is being renovated and will open soon.</p>
<h3 id="e58">French Concession Adequately Handles Flour Speculation <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>Bread Prices Also Closely Examined</p>
<p>Representatives from the French Concession's Daily Necessities Stabilization Committee, Consular Police, and Public Health Department inspected flour shops and bakeries throughout the French Concession on the 27th. The purpose of the inspection was to determine whether the selling price of household bread was in accordance with the newly established regulations. Regarding flour market speculation, there are appropriate countermeasures for speculators who are found to have factual evidence.</p>
<h3 id="e59">No Reason for Handing Over Land Bureau Archives to the Puppet Regime <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Chinese Side Expresses Opposition</p>
<p>Yesterday, the "North China Daily News" reported that "the negotiations between the Consular Body in this port and the puppet regime regarding the transfer of the Land Bureau's archive files have reached their final stage, and the transfer is only a matter of time." Since this news was released, people at home and abroad in the city have been extremely surprised. However, the general belief is that the concession authorities should not do this. This is because the Land Bureau's archives are officially entrusted to the 工部局 (Municipal Council) by the Chinese government. Regardless of the fact that the puppet "municipal government" has not been recognized by various countries and has no legal status, even from the perspective of ordinary legal principles, the Consular Body should not take such an act of abandoning its contract and betraying its faith. If this really happens, the Chinese side will file a serious protest.</p>
<h3 id="e60">Nanshi Refugee Zone to be Dispersed Today <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Since the Nanshi Refugee Zone announced the formal dispersal of all 19,000 refugees at the end of this month, our agency has learned that each refugee should receive one month's worth of grace rice. The Aftermath Association and the General Office of the district dispatched personnel yesterday to distribute these provisions completely. The formal dispersal begins today. At the same time, the staff of the various shelters and offices in the district are also scheduled to be dismissed today. The refugee zone, created single-handedly by Father Jacquinot, is being abandoned halfway, which is sadly disheartening. However, the situation in the district is very stable. Although the refugees are being dispersed, the district is inherently a safe zone and its original status will definitely not be changed.</p>

<p>Dance Halls Have Been Closed; Dancers Sent Back to Shanghai</p>
<p>Since the start of the Chinese War of Resistance, Haiphong and Hanoi have become conduits for people and goods traveling from the coast to the interior. The volume of travelers and goods has been quite large, leading to a distorted prosperity in the local area. Entertainment venues such as dance halls have also taken the opportunity to emerge. Recently, the French authorities, because the war is in full swing, have issued orders to ban them and sent the Chief of Police, Mr. Ziyetian, to order their closure. Dozens of Chinese dancers who had traveled from Shanghai have already been sent back to Shanghai. From now on, there will be no sounds of drums and music in Haiphong and Hanoi.</p>

<p>The "North China Daily News" Tokyo Special Cable reports that after the US fleet sailed from Hawaii, its whereabouts have been a mystery. This has caused all kinds of speculation in Japan. Some say that the fleet is heading to Manila or Singapore. However, most people do not hold this view, because they believe that President Roosevelt would not take such a direct provocative action against Japan. Many believe that the US fleet is heading to Panama, South America, or the Pacific.</p>

<h3 id="e63">Modernization is Advancing, Foretelling China's Revival; Six Christian Schools Held Graduation Ceremonies Yesterday; Speech by Mr. An Lide, American Commercial Officer <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Four hundred and fifty students from Christian Ginling Women's College, Shanghai Women's Medical College, Zhijiang College of Arts and Sciences, Soochow University, Shanghai University, and St. John's University held a graduation ceremony at the Grand Guangming Theater yesterday (29th) at 10:00 AM. Dr. An Lide, the American Commercial Officer in China, delivered a speech.</p>
<p>A Sign of Revival Before the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, China was already on the path to modernization. The vast modernization process that began was rapidly developing and demonstrating its potential for trade to the world. This modernization process has had an encouraging impact on all aspects of the lives of the Chinese people and throughout the country, foreshadowing the revival of the nation and determining the fate of a quarter of humanity. The rapid progress of transportation and communications is of particular significance. Modern industries are being established across the country, and the situation of the rural masses is rapidly improving.</p>
<p>Schools are Everywhere What is even more significant is that modern schools are everywhere. In terms of providing women with modern education opportunities in various countries in the Far East, no country has developed as rapidly as China. I believe that the temporary setbacks China has encountered on its path to modernization are truly one of the greatest tragedies in history. However, observers believe that the war in China is actually causing progress and modernization to penetrate the great west and more remote areas. Tens of thousands of Chinese educators, youth, and administrative personnel have, because of the war, traveled thousands of miles to remote hinterlands, not only becoming familiar with areas they were previously unfamiliar with, but also using their influence to break down conservative ideas in these backward areas.</p>
<p>Solidarity is Strengthened Therefore, the war has strengthened China's unity, promoted the development of the situation, and accelerated the spread of the spirit of modernization among the masses. Mr. An concluded by saying, "You are now encountering the most critical era in your country's history. Your gathering here today demonstrates your ability to work for a common purpose. The thoughts and actions of the Chinese people are becoming increasingly unified. Looking to the future, there is no fear. I urge you to do your best to develop a spirit of cooperation among your compatriots, so that your country will quickly achieve economic and political independence, and the resumption of the modernization process and the ensuing trade will be what the world expects."</p>
<h3 id="e64">Five Religions Lecture at Mother Feng's Birthday Celebration <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Lecture given by Jiang Zhuzhuang yesterday</p>
<p>Yesterday was the 70th birthday of the honorable mother of Mr. Feng Bingnan. Although Mr. Feng strongly declined to accept congratulations in advance, those who went to offer their congratulations yesterday were still very numerous. According to his son, every time it is his grandmother's birthday, even if it has been raining for a long time, it will definitely clear up. Yesterday morning, it was raining heavily, but by 9:00 AM, the rain stopped and the sky cleared. It can be said that this has been consistently verified. In the afternoon at 5:30 PM, the first day of the Five Religions lecture was held at the YMCA.</p>
<p>The turnout was so large that it set a new record. The upper and lower floors were completely full, and people continued to arrive. Those who arrived later had no place to stand. First, his son, Mr. Zhenwei, gave an opening speech on behalf of his father. Then, Mr. Jiang Zhuzhuang (Weiqiao), an old lay Buddhist, lectured on the moral essentials of Confucianism. Mr. Jiang has a unique understanding and deep cultivation of Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism, and has long been admired by those who listen to his lectures. Even though his voice is soft when he lectures, his words are clear. This is because he has benefited from his more than 40 years of meditation. He had previously published a book on quiet meditation methods, which is revered by those who practice meditation. Today (Sunday) he will lecture on Christianity, tomorrow (Monday) he will lecture on Buddhism, and the last two days will be</p>
<p>Taoism and Islam. There are very few lecturers on Taoism, and only Mr. Jiang is capable of doing so. Islam is rarely heard by people outside the religion. This is a rare opportunity to have an elder from Islam give a lecture. On each lecture day, various books are given away as gifts. Yesterday's gifts were the Entrance to Confucianism Preliminary Examination Tickets and the Twenty-Four Filial Piety Stories of Emperors of Past Dynasties. Therefore, it is believed that in the next four days, the audience will be even more crowded.</p>

<p>The English "China Press" reports that German youths born in 1921 who are living in Shanghai have received orders from the German Consulate in this city to report in person to serve in the military or for labor service. The German Consulate's notice states that this action is being taken in accordance with the "Order on the Management of Overseas Germans" issued by the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs on April 22 of this year, and is part of a plan to have overseas Germans serve in the current war in Europe. German citizens in this city who have received the order must report to the German Consulate in person as soon as possible, no later than July 15th. In addition, German citizens in older military grades who had previously obtained certificates of exemption from military service must also exchange them for new certificates at the German Consulate on July 15th.</p>

<p>Pan Lianbao, a teaboy from Yancheng at the Shanghai Branch of the Jiangsu Farmers Bank at 5219 Avenue Joffre, sneaked into the bank's vault on the third floor during the Sunday and Dragon Boat Festival holidays on the 9th and 10th of this month, stealing more than 20,000 yuan in cash and disappearing without a trace. It was not until the morning of the 11th, when the bank began to open for business, that Cheng Xiuming, the chief of general affairs, discovered tools such as a crowbar and iron rods outside the vault door, and realized that a large sum of money had been stolen. He then reported it to the French police, who dispatched detective Bi Minhhui from Danyang, employee number 137 of the bank, and Jiang Axing from Nantong, on suspicion of colluding with the fugitive Pan Lianbao. They were subsequently arrested by the police. After investigation, the charges were found to be true, and Bi and Jiang were sent to the Second Special Court for prosecution. After interrogation by Judge Liao, the verdict was announced yesterday. Bi Minhhui was sentenced to five years in prison for joint theft of public funds, and Jiang A was sentenced to three years in prison for the same crime. A warrant has been issued for the arrest of the main culprit, Pan Lianbao.</p>
<h3 id="e68">Feng Bingnan's Words to Commemorate His Mother's Birthday (3); Explaining the Essence of the Eight Virtues is Rooted in Supreme Filial Piety; Diligence, Frugality, and Self-Reliance are the Foundation of the Eight Virtues <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Regarding Chinese morality, the old saying includes the Eight Virtues of Filial Piety, Brotherly Love, Loyalty, Trustworthiness, Propriety, Righteousness, Integrity, and Sense of Shame. Among the Eight Virtues, Filial Piety comes first, indicating that the virtue of Filial Piety is the most important of the Eight Virtues and is the root of being human. The ancients said, "Filial piety and brotherly love, are they not the root of being human?" This statement is very true. All of a person's moral behavior must start from oneself. Therefore, the Great Learning emphasizes self-cultivation. Thinking about where one comes from, one will naturally develop filial thoughts. If a person wants to fulfill filial piety, the remaining seven virtues are indispensable.</p>
<p>The Classic of Filial Piety says, "Filial piety is the constant principle of Heaven, the righteousness of Earth, and the conduct of the people." The so-called "conduct of the people" of course means that all people should have filial conduct. It can be seen that the ancients also saw a great relationship between filial piety and the whole people. According to my statement above, it is especially about the survival of the nation.</p>
<p>Among the Eight Virtues, the second is Brotherly Love. What is brotherly love? According to Zhu Xi's explanation, "Serving older brothers well is brotherly love." The explanation in the Shuowen Jiezi (a Chinese dictionary) is "Being kind to brothers." The meaning is that brothers should be loving to each other. Not only should younger brothers obey older brothers, but older brothers should also love their younger brothers. Because brothers are all born of the same parents, being able to love brothers is the same as being able to respect parents. Therefore, the virtue of brotherly love is also inseparable from filial piety.</p>
<p>Zeng Zi said, "Not being dignified in one's residence is not filial piety." "Dignified" means respectful and "courteous." He also said, "Not being loyal when serving the ruler is not filial piety." In the era of rulers and kings, the ruler was the head of the country and the representative of the country. Being loyal to the ruler is being loyal to the country. A person should not only be loyal to the country, but also be loyal to whatever he does. Loyalty means "exhausting one's heart and not deceiving." Zeng Zi said, "In planning for others, is one not loyal?" It can be seen that the word "loyalty" can be applied to everything. Zeng Zi also said, "Not being respectful when holding office is not filial piety." This means that officials must respect their responsibilities. The best way for officials to respect their responsibilities is to do their best to do what they should do righteously. The most important thing for self-cultivation is integrity. If one is not incorruptible, unable to do one's best, and unable to do what one should do righteously, then that is "not being respectful when holding office." Not only should officials be like this, but no matter what we do, shouldn't we follow righteousness and maintain our integrity? He also said, "Not being trustworthy to friends is not filial piety." Trustworthiness means being honest and not deceiving, and doing what you say. He also said, "Not being brave in battle is not filial piety." The Analects says, "Knowing shame is close to courage." Being brave in battle is knowing shame. A person should not only be brave in battle, but should also have the courage to do whatever is right, and have the courage to face all difficulties and hardships. Being able to have courage is knowing shame.</p>
<p>According to the above, Brotherly Love, Loyalty, Trustworthiness, Propriety, Righteousness, Integrity, and Sense of Shame are all included in the scope of Filial Piety. If a person is deficient in any one of the Eight Virtues, he is humiliating his parents and going against the purpose of parents raising children. Therefore, to fulfill filial piety, one must take care of all eight virtues. That is why it is said that filial piety is the most important of the Eight Virtues.</p>
<p>The purpose of parents raising children is, of course, to continue their clan. In addition, there is a broader and not necessarily conscious purpose, which is to cultivate healthy members for the country, the nation, the society, and humanity. If a person is deficient in any one of the Eight Virtues, he cannot be considered healthy, that is, morally unhealthy. This kind of unhealthiness will greatly hurt the hearts of parents. Not only will it hurt the hearts of parents, but it will also harm society. This is unfilial piety. Therefore, all eight virtues are included in filial piety.</p>
<p>The Eight Virtues mentioned by the ancients are already very broad, but I believe that there are three very important and concrete things that should be added. The first is self-reliance, the second is diligence, and the third is frugality. I will discuss self-reliance in more detail later when I talk about social welfare. As for diligence and frugality, they are not only virtues of being human, but simply necessary conditions for being human. Because the most important thing for a person is to be able to live, and what parents expect of their children is also to expect them to be able to live and succeed in their careers. To live, one must be diligent. Yu the Great's control of the floods and Tao Kan's moving bricks are both good examples. There is no one in the world who is diligent but cannot live, and there is no one in the world who succeeds without going through hard work. Frugality is also an indispensable virtue in life. This virtue not only affects the individual's life, but can also affect the entire society. Because if a person is extravagant and uses more than his own production capacity, he will inevitably seek undue benefits. At first, he will be greedy, and gradually he will become predatory, not hesitating to commit adultery and violate the law, harming heaven and reason. If there are too many people in a society who cannot be frugal, this society will produce all kinds of unrest and chaos. Filial piety, brotherly love, loyalty, trustworthiness, propriety, righteousness, integrity, and sense of shame are very good and are the foundation of being human. To maintain these eight virtues, self-reliance, diligence, and frugality are especially the foundation of the foundation.</p>

<h3 id="e69">Robber Wei Shoulin and Others Cry Bitterly in Court; Mutually Testify that Wu Qilun's Murder Case is Unrelated to Gu Zhuxuan; Request a Speedy Trial to Avoid Continued Coercion <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Wei Shoulin and other notorious robbers were previously apprehended by the Public Concession Police. During questioning, they confessed to committing the murder of lawyer Wu Qilun and implicated Gu Zhuxuan as the instigator. The police subsequently arrested Gu. After repeated trials, the suspects, including Wei Shoulin, Wang Xingfang, Xia Guifu, Xia Shoufeng, and Zeng Changchun, all firmly asserted that Gu had indeed instigated the murder of Wu. However, when they appeared in the higher court for trial, all the defendants</p>
<p>suddenly recanted, claiming that the case had nothing to do with Gu. They stated that the murder of Wu was actually the result of a failed attempt to rob Wu's diamond ring. The court questioned why they had not recanted during previous interrogations and why they were suddenly changing their stories. The defendants responded that they had been held at the police station before, but now they were being held in the Western Prison, where they were free from all kinds of unimaginable treatment, allowing them to tell the truth. The court, deeming further investigation necessary, postponed the trial. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Feng Shide convened a criminal</p>
<p>court to continue the hearing. The police argued that the defendants' recantations were due to the influence of Zeng Changchun, an associate of Gu Zhuxuan, and presented the suspects' written confessions from the police station as evidence. The court then brought the suspects to the stand, questioning them one by one. The suspects hemmed and hawed in response to the court's questions. Wei Shoulin even burst into tears in court, unable to utter a word, pleading with the court to quickly sentence him and send him to the Western Prison. Zeng Weichun then</p>
<p>repeatedly slammed his head against the wooden post of the defendant's dock, causing a large lump to appear on his head immediately. The defendants' defense lawyers, Wang Yaotang, Wu Linkun, Jiang Pingfan, Fan Gang, and Yu Enliang, immediately stood up and stated that the defendants had been returned to the police station on the 21st of the month after being sent to the Western Prison. Therefore, if the defendants were to make truthful statements, it was necessary to guarantee that they would be sent directly to the Western Prison after the hearing and not returned to the police station. Otherwise, even if the defendants wanted to speak frankly, they would find it</p>
<p>difficult to achieve their goal due to the unbearable suffering of coercion. The situation today was already a glimpse of this. The court asked the suspects whether their recantations had been instigated by Zeng Changchun. All the defendants claimed that they had had no opportunity to speak with Zeng at all and could not have been influenced by him. After a detailed questioning by Judge Feng, the court adjourned the trial for a later date, ordering all the defendants to be returned to the Western Prison.</p>

<p>Chen Xinji from Jiading, 27 years old this year, is the son of Chen Jiruo, a prominent figure in the tea and food industry who owns seven well-known establishments including Laoda Fang, Tianlu, and Ye Biji. He currently works as an accountant at the Ye Biji branch at 541 Avenue Joffre. In 1934, he married Cao Junying (resident of 1 Minde Lane, Ladu Road), who was from the same hometown and of the same age, at the Nanshi Customs Brokerage Office.</p>
<p>After the marriage, the couple's relationship was relatively harmonious. They had a son named Huizhong (4 years old) and a daughter named Huihua (2 years old). However, Chen, feeling weary of his wife due to multiple pregnancies, began to frequent singing halls and theaters. He became deeply involved with a dancer named Lu Yingxia (also known as Lu Qipei, from Guangdong, 25 years old this year, residing at 322 Wenlin Road). Soon, he rented a house for her in the overpass building at 7 Shanqing Lane, Kangdi Road, spending thousands of gold on clothing and accessories. From then on, Chen treated his wife, who had shared his hardships,</p>
<p>as if she were worn-out shoes. He even stopped providing living expenses for his children. Cao initially filed a lawsuit against Chen in the Civil Division of the Second Special Court, demanding cohabitation and payment of living expenses, requesting 200 yuan per month. However, Chen was insincere, and the mediation failed. As she was preparing to formally sue, she learned from friends that her husband had a new lover. She hired lawyers Yuan Hanyun and Wu Xiaolin, who, based on a tip, requested the French Concession Police to dispatch detectives to the address at 6:30 AM on the 15th of this month.</p>
<p>They apprehended both individuals and confiscated a set of exquisite smoking paraphernalia. They were both sent to the Eighth Criminal Division of the Second Special Court. Judge Qiu Huaning presided over the trial and ordered both defendants to provide a 2,000 yuan surety for their appearance in court whenever summoned. Regarding the plaintiff Cao Junying's incidental civil lawsuit seeking 10,000 yuan in compensation for emotional and material damages, the court ordered both parties to attempt reconciliation during a rescheduled hearing. During the previous court session, both defendants failed to appear, and the court issued arrest warrants. They were apprehended in the afternoon. After a detailed interrogation by the court, the judge announced that</p>
<p>the arguments were concluded and a date would be set for sentencing. Both defendants were required to provide an additional 500 yuan in cash bail. Yesterday morning, the verdict was delivered: "Main text": Chen Xinji, being married, repeatedly committed adultery, sentenced to four months of imprisonment; for smoking opium, sentenced to three months of imprisonment, and fined 300 yuan; the sentences to be served concurrently for a total of six months of imprisonment and a fine of 300 yuan. Lu Yingxia, being involved with a married man in repeated adultery, sentenced to four months of imprisonment; for smoking opium, sentenced to three months of imprisonment, and fined 300 yuan; the sentences to be served concurrently for a total of</p>
<p>six months of imprisonment and a fine of 300 yuan. If imprisonment is commuted to a fine or a fine is commuted to labor, it shall be calculated at 3 yuan per day. Chen Xinji and Lu Yingxia are both required to undergo mandatory drug rehabilitation within one month, at their own expense. The smoking paraphernalia is confiscated. Both defendants are to remain on their original bail during the appeal period.</p>

<h3 id="e77">Six Christian Universities in East China Held Joint Graduation Ceremony Yesterday. President Yang Yongqing Wishes Graduates to Serve the Country Sincerely. A Total of 389 Graduates from St. John's and Five Other Universities. <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>The six Christian Universities in East China, namely Ginling College, Shanghai Women's Medical College, Hangchow University, Soochow University, Shanghai University, and St. John's University, held their third joint graduation ceremony yesterday at 10:00 AM at the Grand Theatre. Guests from all walks of life, along with the faculty, staff, and students from the six universities and their affiliated middle schools, numbering over three thousand, gathered together, creating a grand occasion. The Kuomintang flag was hung on the right side of the stage, the American flag on the left, and the flags of the six universities in the center. The stage was decorated with colorful flowers and floral baskets, creating an elegant and beautiful atmosphere. The ceremony began on time. The US Navy Band played music with uplifting and inspiring melodies. Guests watched as Chinese and Western faculty members from each university, wearing doctoral and master's gowns and hoods, entered the hall in succession and slowly took to the stage. The male and female graduates from each university followed, taking their seats in accordance with the proper etiquette. After singing the Kuomintang anthem and "America the Beautiful," Dr. Minside, Acting President of Hangchow University, gave a congratulatory speech and prayer. Then, the President of Soochow University delivered the opening remarks. This was followed by a speech from Dr. A. Bland Calder, the US Commercial Attaché in Shanghai. After that, the middle school graduation certificates were issued, and the degrees were conferred to the graduates of the six universities. Dr. Bu Fangji, President of St. John's University, then gave an address. The list of award-winning students was announced. Finally, Mr. Shen Siliang, Vice President of St. John's University, gave a thank-you speech. The ceremony ended at around 12:00 PM. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>A Summary of the Speeches: Dr. Yang Yongqing, the chairperson, briefly stated that this was the third joint graduation ceremony of the six Christian universities in East China. He was very honored to have so many guests present. The six Christian universities in Shanghai currently have several thousand students, with departments in liberal arts, science, law, commerce, education, theology, engineering, and medicine. Although the administrative organizations of each university are different, their educational goals are the same, and their spirit is consistent. Because the six universities are located in the same area, they have closer connections, such as joint libraries, joint laboratories, and other possible common facilities, maximizing the benefits of connection and cooperation. Education is a permanent and fundamental endeavor. Students at school cultivate their character and conduct academic research. Once they have completed their studies, they can serve society, promote various constructions, and even improve the country and the world. Therefore, university students bear a very important mission. Christian education promotes cooperation and mutual assistance. In a time of declining morality, we should uphold the Christian spirit of universal love and mutual benefit, sacrifice to ally with friendly nations, advocate justice, and save the situation from collapse. He also wished that the graduates would devote themselves to educational service for the country throughout their lives. Dr. A. Bland Calder, the US Commercial Attaché in Shanghai, gave a lengthy speech in English, which was of great interest to the audience. He essentially said that Chinese students achieve better academic results than students in the United States and other countries, but lack a spirit of cooperation. He also said that studying is for seeking true knowledge for oneself, not for perfunctory work. One must "overcome face." He also said that one should have "the habit of studying maps," so as to take advantage of geographical advantages. For example, China's inherent soybean milk has been around for over a thousand years, but its utilization has not been thoroughly explored. After more than a decade of research, the United States has realized that the function of Chinese soybean milk is equal to that of milk and has been widely used. Dr. Bu Fangji, President of St. John's University, delivered an address in English, highlighting three key points: (1) Knowledge must be applied appropriately, not misused, in order to maximize its effectiveness. (2) One must do things according to the situation, without prejudice and without being fixated on one's own opinions. (3) One must have a firm and decisive spirit when faced with challenges. Once one has confidence, one should not be discouraged by setbacks or give up halfway. Mr. Shen Siliang, Vice President of St. John's University, gave a thank-you speech, expressing his gratitude to the Asia Cinema Company for providing the venue, the YMCA for providing the reception room, and the US Navy Band for providing the music. He was very grateful for their kindness and also thanked Dr. Calder for his speech and the guests for their presence.</p>
<p>Conferring of Degrees</p>
<p>Relevant faculty members from each university announced the names of students who had passed and, in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry of Education, conferred degrees separately. Those who received doctoral and master's degrees, as well as bachelor's degrees from the theological seminary, stood up in turn to pay respects on the stage. The ceremony was solemn, and applause frequently erupted. In total, the graduates from the various colleges of the six universities included 24 medical doctors, 2 masters of science, 162 bachelors of arts from the liberal arts, science, and commerce colleges, 1 bachelor of education, 84 bachelors of law, 90 bachelors of science, 1 bachelor of theology, and 25 bachelors of engineering, totaling 389 people. As for the affiliated middle schools, only Soochow and Shanghai Universities participated in the joint ceremony. The others held their graduation ceremonies separately at their respective schools. There were 50 graduates from the Soochow University Affiliated Middle School, including Zhao Fuxin. The principal of the affiliated middle school, Zhou Chengen, nominated them, and Dr. Wen Naishi, the acting president, issued their certificates. There were 59 graduates from the Shanghai University Affiliated Middle School, including Yu Xinzheng. Dr. Li Haoshan, the director of the affiliated middle school, nominated them, and President Fan Zhengkang issued their certificates.</p>

<h3 id="e82">Opening of the United Cup Charity Basketball Tournament: Paramount Defeats Liangxi by a Large Margin, Youlian Reverses the Situation and Defeats Qifan. Today, Jia 2 Group's Shanghai Youth vs. Qunyi <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>The opening ceremony of the United Cup Summer Charity Basketball Tournament was held yesterday at 5:00 PM at the Paramount Sports Club on Jingan Temple Road and Jessfield Road. Three men's and women's matches were quite exciting, and a large crowd of spectators filled the venue. Mr. Yuan Lü and others attended the ceremony and gave opening speeches. The Nanyang Disabled Children's Home band played music to add to the atmosphere, which was very lively. As a result of the competition, the Women's Performance Team Jingwu defeated Shanghai Star by 38 to 22. In Group A, Youlian defeated Qifan by 46 to 43, and Paramount defeated Liangxi by 65 to 44. After the women's performance, Mrs. Zhu Daxun presented two silver cups to each team.</p>
<p>Each of the Three Men's and Women's Matches Was Exciting</p>
<p>In the women's performance, Shanghai Star played against Jingwu. In the first half, Shanghai Star performed extremely well, leading 20 to 14. However, in the second half, Jingwu replaced its players with fresh forces, and the situation immediately turned for the worse. Moreover, Jingwu had sufficient reserves, while Shanghai Star gradually ran out of steam and was defeated. The final score was 38 to 22. When the Group A teams appeared, the atmosphere was greatly invigorated. Qifan played against Youlian. Qifan was originally the Bomber team, but because former Hualian team members Chen Xuechong and others participated, they changed their name. However, Chen and others temporarily changed their minds and cooperated with Shanghai Youth, intending to compete with Paramount. The Bomber team had become Qifan. In the first half, Youlian was disjointed. Qifan's Xu Jusheng and Zhai Xilin and others attacked smoothly, leading all the way. The score at halftime was 23 to 17. But in the second half, Youlian gradually got the upper hand, chasing closely. Lu Gu was particularly accurate with long-range shots, leading 30 to 28. Qifan reversed from victory to defeat, falling into confusion and unable to catch up. Youlian reversed the situation and won 46 to 41. In the main match, Paramount played against Liangxi. Liangxi's Wang Nanqun, Zhang Jia, Zhuo Guorong, and others attacked with a step-by-step, cautious approach, not easily attempting shots. But Paramount ultimately had experienced players such as Li Zhenzhong, Zhang Shaoqing, Lu Zhongen, Feng Nianhua, and Chen Xianglong, who were well-matched. Liangxi repeatedly failed to attack and was at a loss. They were unable to defend against Paramount's sharp attacks. Until Paramount scored, Liangxi only managed to score one point through a penalty. Paramount led 21 to 1. Paramount did not overdo it, and Liangxi's counterattacks were effective. The score at halftime was 33 to 17. The final score was 65 to 44. The results of the three matches are listed below:</p>
<p>Jingwu defeats Shanghai Star (Women's Performance) 38 to 22, Youlian defeats Qifan (Group A) 46 to 41, Paramount defeats Liangxi (Group A) 65 to 44</p>

<p>(Singapore Dispatch) After arriving in Singapore, the Eastern Football Team first won against the Army Allied Team 4-1 and then drew with the Singapore League Team 2-2. In their final match yesterday (9th) afternoon against the Singapore All-Stars, ticket sales began at 1:15 PM. The fans entered the stadium like a flood of water. At that time, the scorching heat was intense, but they were still willing to stand in the sun, sweating profusely. The Chinese Consul-General in Singapore and his wife, as well as members of the Eastern Team, arrived at 5:00 PM. According to the General Association's Profession, there were about 20,000 spectators. At 5:10 PM, the Eastern Team, led by team captain Jingcheng, entered the field.

<p>Luo Weiquan, Xu Jingcheng, Xie Jinhong</p>
<p>Hou Chengtao, Cao Qiuting, Xu Wenkui, Zhang Jinhai, Zhong Yongsen</p>
<p>First Half</p>
<p>The visiting team, wearing red uniforms, kicked off the attack first. The momentum was strong, directly chasing into the main team's hinterland. Jinhai suddenly passed to Wenkui, who made a back-kick shot. Fortunately, the ball was too high and flew over the crossbar. Jinhai launched another attack and headed the ball near the goal, but it went out of bounds at an angle. After eight minutes, the home team took advantage of the danger and launched a counterattack. Terra's cavalry went straight in, lifted his leg to shoot, low and quick. Han rescued, the ball bounced out, and Cleland stood in front of the goal, sweeping the ball into the net. The home team took advantage of the victory to attack again. Terra made a comeback, chasing straight towards the Dragon Gate, doing the same thing. Cleland rushed over, drinking the Yellow Dragon. The Eastern Team was down 0-2 in the first half.</p>
<p>Penalty Kick</p>
<p>Changing sides to fight again, the Eastern Team launched a fierce counterattack. Jinhai continued to lose in the middle. Morey came to stop him, and his actions were rough and was called for a foul. Weiquan passed and Wenkui turned to shoot. Robb held up Ah Dou. After the ball crossed the midline, Xianhan was threatened twice. Qiuting passed high to Chengtao, who went straight into the hinterland. Gollin hooked him, and was called for a foul, giving a penalty kick. Jinhai kicked the ball with his right foot. The ball went in from the right corner, recovering one goal. The Eastern Team's morale improved, and the counterattack was even fiercer. Chengtao and Yongsen's excellent passes shot in a goal. However, the referee ruled that it was offside and invalid. The final result was 1-2, and the Eastern Team lost.</p>

<p>No ruler does not have a desire for good governance, and no ruler does not need people to assist in governance. Without such people, the ruler's power will be insufficient, his considerations will be incomplete, and the pursuit of order will result in disorder. Therefore, matters of law, finance, and grain are all entrusted to aides. The responsibilities of finance and grain are limited to matters of household affairs, marriage, land, and money, but the most crucial task is the handover of accounts. In the southeastern provinces, those dealing with grain transport emphasize finance and grain over law, while in the northwestern provinces, where finance and grain are less significant, they emphasize law over finance and grain, often handling both. Those handling finance and grain only need to be familiar with the funds to manage well. Legal matters, however, require detailed examination of precedents and reference to laws and regulations, making them seem more difficult than finance and grain. Thus, in the differences between emphasis and neglect, corruption arises. Therefore, officials rely more on those skilled in law than on those skilled in finance and grain. Those who handle legal matters are traditionally from Yue, because like attracts like, and things are grouped by type. Similarly, people from Hui are often salt or timber merchants, people from Cixi often run pharmacies, and people from Shanxi often open money-lending shops. People from Yue regard studying the doctrines of Shen Buhai and Han Fei as a back door for scholars. They often abandon their studies of other subjects and turn to studying the law. Some have astonishing skill with the pen and have been repeatedly hired for important positions. These people generally emphasize moral character, harbor no private prejudices, and show no favoritism, and employers rely on them as their right and left hands. After working as aides for several years, accumulating wealth, they can move from being aides to becoming officials, taking a familiar road with ease. They are knowledgeable about all precedents. The good aides of the past become the capable officials of today.</p>

<h3 id="e88">Financial Matters: End of Month Foreign Exchange – Many Forced to Close Positions <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday’s foreign exchange market saw no change in HSBC listings. The unofficial British and American markets saw fluctuating conditions, changing multiple times a day, with operators taking inconsistent steps. Both buying and selling occurred. Initially, the British and American exchange rates fell by 1 3/8 cents, leading to a weak state for both currencies. Subsequently, Japanese spinning mills settled some accounts and American banks showed appetite, creating tightening potential, with the American exchange rate reaching 6.15625 yuan. However, due to many Chinese speculators closing their long positions heavily at the end of the month, the rate rebounded. The June rate was 6.21875 yuan, but the Bank of England soon bought shillings and Hong Kong Electric purchased American exchange, causing the price to soften again. The closing market showed increasing tightening potential. Ultimately, British gold closed at 3/8/4.375 shillings, unchanged from the previous day's closing price. The American exchange rate was 6.125 yuan, a decrease of 0.015625 yuan from the previous day. Gold futures were slightly tighter, while American exchange futures shrank sharply by 0.01875 yuan. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday, and the banks were closed for the first half of the year-end settlement on July 1st and 2nd (next Monday and Tuesday), and there was no foreign exchange market.</p>
<p>Active Buying at Noon</p>
<p>In the early morning, the London cable was down 0.0625 for near-term and 0.125 for far-term. New York silver prices remained flat, and London raw gold remained stable. Exchange rates between British and American currencies, as well as with Shanghai, were all flat. The American exchange rate fell 1 3/8 cents against the British pound, 0.05 yuan against Shanghai, and there was no market against the French franc. The central bank's listed rates for various currencies remained the same. The banks opened in the morning with spot lending rates of 3/8/7.5 shillings for British gold and 6.25 yuan for American exchange, up 0.03125 shillings and 0.03125 yuan respectively from the previous night's close. After opening, foreign banks showed considerable interest in supplying, so even though American banks and Japanese spinning mills were absorbing, prices remained stable. It is estimated that American banks bought 6.25 yuan worth of American exchange from foreign banks in June, and Japanese factories bought forward American exchange at 6.0625 yuan. HSBC's listing was announced and remained unchanged. The silver balance tax was announced to be reduced by 0.50%. Afterwards, the market softened slightly, and the American exchange rate once fell below 6.15625 yuan. Later, Chinese speculators suddenly bought a large amount of near-term and far-term American exchange, causing it to harden slightly again. Chinese speculators sold July American exchange to foreign banks at prices from 6.125 to 6.15625 yuan, and June American exchange traded at 6.21875 yuan. However, the Bank of England suddenly developed buying interest, and Hong Kong Electric purchased, softening the market. The Bank of England entered into June British gold with speculators at 3/8/7.5 shillings, while Hong Kong Electric purchased July American exchange from American banks, pushing the price down to 6.09375 yuan. By noon, the potential remained tight. As a result, British gold closed at 3/8/4.375 shillings, and American exchange at 6.125 yuan. July British gold closed at 3/8/1.25 shillings, and American exchange at 6.00 yuan. Compared to yesterday's closing prices, spot British was flat, American tightened by 0.015625 yuan, July British shrank by 0.0315 shillings, and American softened by 0.01875 yuan. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday.</p>

<h3 id="e89">Foreign Currencies Rise <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw the "Shatse" (a term for local Shanghai currency) finally trend upwards, with British and American gold pounds following suit. British gold notes were slightly in demand, and market prices rose slightly. American gold notes, due to the sudden fall and then rebound of the British pound, caused the black market American exchange rate to tighten suddenly, leading to a surge in buying interest. The evening market rose to 16.35 yuan, up 0.25 yuan from the previous day. Demand for Hong Kong notes decreased sharply, and market prices fell by 0.02 yuan. Canadian notes were slightly in demand, and market prices rose slightly. Demand for Japanese gold notes became increasingly strong, and market prices rose to 1.16 yuan in the evening. Supply and demand for Korean notes were balanced, and the evening market remained at 0.975 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Discount Rates Step by Step Lower <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>

<p>London, 28th dispatch: The recent silver market saw a fall of 0.0625 for near-term and 0.125 for far-term. Some people covered short positions, and speculators sold.

<h3 id="e92">Before Year-End Closing, Gold Market Trend Remains Firm <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot "Shatse" unofficial market saw a firm trend amidst opposing buying and selling forces. The intraday fluctuations were small, and operators generally lacked long-term intentions. With foreign exchange fluctuating between softening and tightening, gold prices also fluctuated in tandem. The morning opening was 5450 yuan, due to the tightening American exchange rate. However, securities firms soon sold, dropping the price to 50 yuan. Subsequently, it rose by over 30 yuan after being pulled up by gold shops and money exchangers. However, retail investors suddenly wanted to sell, and the market soon declined again. Before the close, the exchange market finally softened, and securities firms absorbed some, raising the price to 5435 yuan. Ultimately, the market closed at 5430 yuan, up 50 yuan from the previous day. The off-market potential remained firm, with buyers at 5450 yuan and no sellers. There is no market in the afternoon on Saturday. Also, from today, Sunday, until next Tuesday, is the semi-annual closing period for the silver and money industries, and the market will be closed for three days as usual. The half-day's trading volume was approximately over 1000 taels. Gold jewelry shops quoted 90 yuan for large gold, while customs gold remained flat.</p>
<p>"Shatse" Rises 50 Yuan</p>
<p>From the morning, the price of each bar (ten taels) initially fell due to exchange quotes. The tightening American exchange rate caused the price to rise. Initially, gold shops sold silver to silver shops at 5450 yuan per ten taels, 70 yuan higher than the previous day. Afterwards, operators saw that this price was quite willing to supply, and buyers were hesitant, and with securities firms selling heavily, and retail investors also selling, the price immediately fell by a small 50 yuan. Silver shops sold 20 taels to money exchangers at 5400 yuan. Later, with fewer sellers, the absorption by silver shops and some money exchangers turned strong, and the price was raised again by 30 yuan. Silver shops sold 20 taels each to gold shops and money exchangers, both at 5430 yuan. Subsequently, the exchange rate rebounded, and securities firms sold off their long positions, while money exchangers also supplied, causing the price to fall back by 40 yuan. Gold shops traded 10 taels with each other, resulting in a price of 5390 yuan. After 11:00, the exchange market rebounded strongly, and the buying force was revitalized. Silver shops, securities firms, and some jewelry stores competed to purchase, raising the price by another 45 yuan before the close. Silver shops sold 10 taels to securities firms at 5435 yuan. Then, gold shops sold 20 taels to silver shops at 5430 yuan for the noon closing price, resulting in a rise of 50 yuan from the previous day, with a fluctuation of 60 yuan in half a day. The current selling price of gold in cash shops is about ten yuan higher than "Shatse", while the buying price is reduced by 30 yuan. The current standard gold is more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there is little trading.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Returns to a High of 10 Yuan</p>

<h3 id="e93">Securities: London British Commercial Shares - Decline Halted Slightly <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's securities unofficial market only conducted half a day's trading. Many floated positions sold slightly due to the three-day holiday, in order to reduce interest burden. Coincidentally, a certain bank had already stopped buying, so market prices softened slightly. However, trading was extremely quiet, so the market price fluctuations were also very minimal. No major players participated, only Tongyu Lianyi and a few clients bought, while Lianhe Tianfeng and No. 64 sold. The total turnover was no more than 200,000 yuan. Market prices decreased slightly by 0.05 to 0.10 yuan. The following is a simplified table. The market will be closed for two days on Monday and Tuesday for bank settlement.</p>

<h3 id="e94">Grains: "Du Yang" Rice's Momentum Surges Again - Yesterday's Price Soars by 2-3 Yuan <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>The rice market carried on the afternoon's rising trend from the previous day, opening with a tight tone. This was influenced by the Hong Kong-Vietnam incident, which greatly agitated people's hearts. Also, with the market closed for the next two days, actual sales also bought as much as possible to meet retail needs. The greedy traders were also participating, and there was competition for purchase from the interior, so the market rose step by step. The buying interest remained strong in the afternoon, and the market became even more volatile, rising all the way without any signs of slowing down. The closing prices were as much as 2-3 yuan higher than the previous close. For example, No. 1 Chen Saigon reached 65.5 yuan, 65 yuan. No. 2 was 63.5 yuan, 63 yuan. "Huojiao" (a type of rice) was 64.2 yuan, 64 yuan. No. 1 Siam was 65 yuan, 64.6 yuan. No. 2 was 63.3 yuan, 62.8 yuan. "Xiaojiao" (another type of rice) was 62.5 yuan. Tokyo "Pa Jien" was 59.5 yuan, 59 yuan. Mixed Broken was 52 yuan, 51.5 yuan. "Mi Tang" was 54 yuan, 53 yuan. There were 18 shipments of No. 2 Siamese rice, initially opening at 68.9 yuan, then rising to 70.5 yuan, and 26 shipments at 69.5 yuan and 69 yuan. Over 200 tons were opened for the whole day, and nearly 20,000 bags were opened for spot, it is said.</p>
<p>The source of glutinous rice has been cut off, and high-quality rice is lacking, causing the owners to become unusually proud. The selling prices have all been raised by one yuan or more. "Jin Piao Te Yuan" is out of stock and there is no market. Only "Zhong Guan" opened at 70 yuan. "Chang Dan Bai Yuan" was 60 yuan, 59 yuan, and even inferior "Su Ao" required 58 yuan. "Jiangbei" goods were 58 yuan, 57.5 yuan.</p>
<p>Although national rice such as thick and thin "Jing" rice continues to arrive, the quantity is not large, making the off-market unofficial prices feel increasingly firm. Not only are the holders of "Huai" goods hoarding, but the guests are also greedy, and the selling prices have all risen sharply by 1-2 yuan or more. "Chang Bang Te Qing Jing" requires 73-74 yuan. "Su Kun Chang Xi Bai Jing" is as high as 71-72 yuan, and inferior "Su" goods are 70 yuan. "Qing Si Te Bo Dao" is 73 yuan. Large quantities are 71-72 yuan, and "Su" is 70 yuan. "Nan Gang Zao Dao" is 70 yuan and inferior to 69 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Local Street Flour Sales Increase Frequently <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour trading was quite lively, mostly retail from local streets and rural villages. Due to the bank's semi-annual closing holiday, the number of people who needed it increased. The factory side, with the factory price rising three times in a row, was enough to cope with the actual sales in the local street, and the customer sales were still suspended. It is heard that the customer side, with the factory powder lacking supply, has secretly bought Japanese flour, creating an opportunity for Japanese flour to be dumped. Returned flour old car brand must be sold for more than 16 yuan, while Yuan Cannon and Tianzhu brand require 17.10 to 17.20 yuan, but there are no formal agreements. The total market turnover is estimated to be about 14,000 to 15,000 bags, and the No. 2 flour is still opening at 15.20 yuan, all handled by the local street.</p>
<p>Also, the local authorities in this city, in view of the continuous rise in flour prices and the secret increase in retail flour prices, are quite concerned. They convened a discussion with flour merchants the day before yesterday, stating that the selling price of flour should not be raised excessively, and according to the current market factory price, the selling price should be set at 15.50 yuan per bag, and should not be exceeded, and should give priority to supplying the noodle, cake, steamed bun, large pancake and fried dough stick industries. Once the new wheat raw materials are fully supplied, the factory prices should also be reduced immediately, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Yarn and Cotton: Many Floating Positions Cut Clear - Yarn Prices Rebound <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market turned upward, because the difficult end of the month has arrived, and the general lack of floating positions have been cut and cleared. The market has seen a bit of dryness. Long positions have become active again. The market has changed from tired to strong. In fact, it has been falling for days, and there may be a reaction, but the actual sales channels are still very rare.</p>
<p>The current yarn market opened flat in the morning, without much activity. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn was 875 yuan, falling to 70 yuan, fluctuating between 870 and 880 yuan for a long time. Then, because the actual product was slightly lacking, and the long positions came to drag in a few bales, and it was the time for the mid-year closing, the market will be closed on July 1st and 2nd for the silver and money industries to handle closing procedures, and the general small accounts would rather straighten it out to avoid a few days of risk, so the market rebounded to close at 925 yuan. The half-day transaction statistics totaled 2,265 bales, and the market price for 20-count Double Horse yarn rose by 75 yuan. Today, 20 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong, 85 bales to Haikou, and 10 bales to _________. The amounts purchased by each port are listed as follows:</p>

<h3 id="e97">Indian Cotton Military Insurance Costs Continue to Rise <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Current cotton trading remains quiet, with no demand from any party. This scene is due to the sufficient cotton purchased in the past, and there is currently concern that there is a surplus, so the market is lifeless. It is faintly heard that Japanese factories are slightly purchasing, but the payment must be delayed for one or two months.</p>
<p>Another message from the outside market: In the New York cotton market, the early morning opening was prosperous due to purchases by speculators, but later, due to sales by spot merchants and the closing of some long positions, the market turned tired. The closing price fell 4-5 pound notes compared to the previous day. In the Indian cotton market, due to transportation difficulties, cotton is stored in Bombay. It is doubtful whether the government will accept military insurance reports. Many spot merchants are handing over cotton to the exchange, so yesterday the forecast fell 10 Rupees.</p>
<p>Although the transaction of foreign cotton in Shanghai has been quiet recently, the major event at the end of June has been passed calmly, and the transportation of Indian cotton is becoming increasingly difficult, and the military insurance costs are rising. The inventory in Shanghai is gradually drying up. Generally, cotton merchants believe that, according to the current situation, it can be maintained for a considerable period. Japanese factories will start purchasing first, and the cotton price will rise. Therefore, the minds of the industry have become firm.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Piece Goods: Hoarders Become Active Again - Cotton Cloth Market Slightly Improves <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>National Cloth: Yesterday's market saw the settlement of June contracts. Because the amount of the current month's contracts was much lower than the previous ones, the market process was stable. Later, as the cotton yarn price rose, the hoarders dragged in goods for less money. The missing goods of each grade increased by 0.25-0.50 yuan per piece. The local street sold more than 500 pieces of white cloth and bleached cloth. The Zhejiang-Jiangxi merchants handled one hundred and several dozen pieces of colored cloth, fine cloth, and coarse cloth. The Hong Kong merchants handled more than one hundred pieces of twill coarse cloth. People from Singapore and other countries handled one thousand and several hundred pieces of bleached cloth, bleached twill and colored cloth.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: "Longtou" (dragon head) fine cloth opened in the morning at 29.8 yuan. With today being Sunday, and the next two days being bank closing days with no market, there is a three-day gap. Generally, thoughts and transactions tend to be long. The market gradually increased. By the noon closing, the selling price opened at 30.08 yuan. After the market, the price was 31 yuan. "Sijunzi" (four gentlemen) started from 0.87 yuan and rose to 0.88-0.89 yuan.</p>
<p>Export: Today, there were 80 pieces of piece goods shipped to Hong Kong, 55 pieces to Haikou, and 47 pieces to Siam.</p>
<h3 id="e99">"Zhigung" Woolen Cloth Inventory Not Large - Standard Market Price Stable <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>"Zhigung" woolen cloth has recently been sold mostly through the Tianjin-Sichuan merchants. Apart from the shoe merchants, the local street has little demand, so the import volume of imported goods is gradually decreasing. Except for two or three old brands, there are very few fixed orders. However, the Sichuan-Tianjin merchants have also reduced their activity due to various environmental changes and transportation difficulties. The shoe merchants on the local street mostly use cotton-woven fake "Zhigung" woolen cloth, so the industry rarely resells this "Zhigung" woolen cloth. Currently, most of the Yuan "Zhigung" woolen cloth that is traded on the market is domestically produced, such as those of Xie Xin, Yin Feng, Zhang Hua, and Da Long. Only a few manufacturers such as Chun He, Yong Hua, and Xin are selling British and German products. Because goods are lacking, the standards have always been firm. Yesterday, Rong Tai's 15330 "Laotou" brand "Li Tu" was sold for 44 yuan per yard, Lu was 5885 for 35 yuan, Hunterson was 2376 for 31 yuan, Yin Feng was 201 for 28 yuan, and Xie Xin was 1000 for 25 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Coal: Indian Coal is Strong Outside But Weak Inside <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>The sales market for Indian coal still shows little improvement. With frequent sources, people are inevitably weak. The market price is strong outside but weak inside. The Calcutta block is only shouting 250 yuan by a certain firm. If the industry negotiates, the plate can be cheaper by 7-8 yuan. Coal dross is 230 yuan, and a small travel fee is added to customers.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Oil Cake: Raw Soybean Oil Slightly Expands <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>The oil market has weakened this week because the price of Rong oil in the interior has loosened, resulting in a lack of transportation capacity, and people's minds have been deteriorating. The market has been trending downward. The local market showed a slight increase in inquiries yesterday. When the general merchants with goods intended to sell, both the upper and lower hands worked together. The market will be closed for two days, and the miscellaneous grains and oil cake market will be closed for the afternoon starting from the 1st of this month (until the end of August), so the various market prices have shifted from a sluggish and stagnant trend to a stable position. The statistics show 100 pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil, the price of which is detailed in the market price, 250 pieces of Yantai raw oil, and 300 cans of canned oil, 400 pieces of Jiaozhou soybean oil, 100 pieces of Qingqi soybean oil, 40 buckets of Qingdao soybean oil, 50 pieces of Yantai soybean oil, 20 buckets of Dalian soybean oil, 50 "dan" of Pudong factory soybean oil, and 200 "dan" of Dayouyu factory soybean oil.</p>
<p>Today, 580 bags of soybeans, 690 bags of sesame, and 500 "zhang" of soybean cake are shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3 id="e102">Sugar Market: Dutch Red Drops 3 Yuan <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market tightened due to quite a few new entrants. The Guild's marked price was 68.5 yuan for 24 coarse white at the foreign customs, up 0.8 yuan, and 54 yuan for transshipment goods. The Taishi brand B mark car white initially remained at 78.5 yuan, then rose to 79 yuan, rebounding 0.5 yuan. However, Dutch red opened at 56 yuan from the joint venture office due to more favorable prices, with 3,514 bags, down 3 yuan, and there were 137 bags of red sand shipped from Qingyuan.</p>
<h3 id="e103">North and South Goods: New Haikou Branches - The First Batch Has Arrived <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>The first batch of new Haikou branches arrived yesterday through Qingyuan, with a total of over 320 boxes. Samples have already been seen, and the water is still good, but the bodies are slightly soft. This is inevitable when new. Roughly today, the plates can be opened, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Silk and Tea: Foreign Firms' Silk Sales Stall <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign silk market was inaccessible due to the Reuters report of a worker strike, but according to private telegrams, the New York near-term was 2.62 yuan and the far-term was 2.545 yuan, up 4.5 to 5.5 yuan compared to the previous day. There was no improvement in the foreign firms' buying appetite. It is heard that Renji Foreign Firm's buying price for white factory 7-8 points is only 4700 yuan, which is nearly 500 yuan lower than at the beginning of last week. As far as silk merchants are concerned, the cost of raw silk is already very high, and it is difficult to ship, so they are all watching the market atmosphere. With limited trust goods, they do not want to sell, so the silk market feels quite stalled. Today, four bales of silk were shipped to Hong Kong, and ten pieces of tea leaves were shipped.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Seafood: Few Domestic Shrimp Tails <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>The arrival and sales of domestic shrimp tails have been rare recently. There are 7 pieces of Yantai goods that have arrived, which are immediately sold. Long Song Island tails are 326 yuan, and large tails are 352 yuan. There are also four pieces of Jiangbei red tails, double large and clean, with a price of 250 yuan. The trend is firm.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Pepper Sources Follow <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>The pepper sales channel is still active, and sources follow, so the situation can be described as stable. The current market price for black large pepper and No. 1 pepper is 107 yuan, Wendao white pepper is 200 yuan, and Dutch white pepper is 190 yuan, and the next grade is 160 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Medicinal Materials: New and Old Lily Slices Intersect - Visible in Ten Days <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Lily slices are in the process of intersecting new and old crops. As Xiang Gang is halfway through, the market is still tired. Old goods are as high as 31-32 yuan, and the next grade is 30 yuan to 29 yuan. The inventory is limited. If sales move, it would not be surprising to see a rise of 4-5 yuan. It is heard that the new goods of this session will probably be on the market in ten days, it is said.</p>

<h3 id="e110">The English Channel: Past and Present <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>The white, jagged cliffs of the Dover area are the only part of England visible from foreign soil. This natural chalk wall rises 300 feet above the blue waters of the English Channel. On a clear day, one can see the French coast 20 miles away, forming a thin gray line along the horizon. The British understand their national character stems from the Dover coast. No other body of water has so shaped human history as the English Channel.</p>
<p>In this day and age, people's thoughts naturally turn to this solid wall and the trenches at its base. The British Isles have relied on their defenders for two thousand years. Forts line the coast, with bows and arrows as their oldest defenses, now replaced by anti-aircraft guns and searchlights. However, the lighthouses built during the Roman Empire, which witnessed the birth of the British Navy and its rise to become the world's invincible fleet, still guide ships through the channel, marking the boundary of the land.</p>
<p>The channel not only physically separates Britain from continental Europe but also fosters a spirit of self-reliance in Britain. Although her culture originates in Europe, her heart remembers her children scattered overseas. She has long wanted to set sail and leave the madhouse that is Europe. But how easy is it? She must, for better or worse, share her fate with Europe.</p>
<p>Several years ago, former British Prime Minister Baldwin casually declared in Parliament that Britain's border was on the Rhine. At the time, most Britons may not have paid much attention to this statement, believing that Britain's border was much closer. Two thousand years ago, Emperor Caesar formed a fleet and, one night, launched a surprise attack on Dover from the port of Boulogne in present-day France. He discovered that soldiers in the cliffs were armed and ready for battle, and Caesar ordered his sailors to sail downstream and land on the beach near the present-day Port of Deal, taking advantage of the gap. That is how Britain was established.</p>
<p>Six hundred years later, Saint Augustine led many missionaries by ship past Dover and landed at the mouth of the River Stour, marking the beginning of British culture.</p>
<p>In 1066, England was conquered by William, Duke of Normandy. However, the Spanish Armada of 1588 and Napoleon's fleet of 1804, although attempting to cross the sea to conquer England, were defeated.</p>
<p>Since then, tactics have changed daily. Airplanes can fly across, and tanks can be transported by air. Britain has had to seek the edge of national defense further from the channel, and she can no longer turn a blind eye to European affairs. Therefore, it is commonly said that the Battle of France is the preliminary battle for the Battle of Britain.</p>

<p>— Bo Ming</p>
<p>In ancient times, nearly all peoples worshipped the sun, hoping it would return after each night. Today, however, we take this sun, which provides light, heat, and energy, for granted. We only pay attention to the sun when special phenomena like solar eclipses or sunspots disrupt ground-based telecommunications traffic.</p>
<p>What makes people disrespect the sun is astronomers. Through telescopes and spectroheliographs, they see the sun as just one of countless stars in the universe. This star is neither particularly large nor exceptionally bright. From an astronomer's point of view, the sun's noteworthy aspect is merely that it is the closest star, only 93 million miles from Earth. A beam of sunlight only takes eight minutes to reach the ground. The light from other nearby stars takes at least four years to reach the ground.</p>
<p>The most interesting question we can ask about the sun and stars is: what makes them shine? When humans first sought an answer, they believed the sun was a giant furnace, fueled by meteorites and other cosmic debris falling into it. Modern astronomers, using calculations, quickly discovered that the supply of such fuel was extremely insufficient.</p>
<p>According to recent estimates, the sun's mass is two followed by thirty zeros tons. If the sun were burning its own mass, it could only sustain heat for two thousand years. However, it has long been proven that the Earth has been receiving heat from the sun for at least two hundred million years. Furthermore, considering the sun's temperature, it is so high that matter cannot burn. Even on the sun's surface, where the temperature reaches ten thousand degrees Fahrenheit, the atoms are in such violent motion that they cannot combine with oxygen to form a chemical mixture called "burning." Thus, the sun's emission of energy must be by a different method.</p>
<p>This method, now recognized by science, is based on a formula from the theory of relativity. This formula states that a small amount of matter is equivalent to a large amount of energy. However, how does this transformation occur? In ground-based laboratories, people have not yet been able to devise a practical transformation process.</p>
<p>Whenever the temperature rises, everything becomes agitated. In the sun's internal furnace, atoms move back and forth at speeds of many miles per second. It is extremely hot there; hard substances that are solid on Earth, like iron and carbon, behave like gases. Atoms in this state move at high speeds, colliding with each other to form new atoms. These new atoms often weigh less than the old atoms, and the difference between the two is emitted as light energy. According to current theory, this light energy is what makes the sun shine.</p>
<p>With such powerful forces at work in the sun, it certainly cannot exist peacefully. We can expect to see huge storms and vortices in the sun's atmosphere. What we find in sunspots and solar prominences are precisely these kinds of storms and vortices. Solar prominences are easiest to see during solar eclipses.</p>
<p>A solar eclipse occurs when the moon is directly between the sun and the Earth, blocking the sunlight seen from the ground. When the sun is completely obscured by the moon's shadow, we can use telescopes to see bright red flares emanating from the sun's edge. These are the solar prominences, forced upward by the pressure of sunlight.</p>
<p>During a total solar eclipse, in addition to prominences, a ring of bluish-white haze can also be seen, called the solar corona. Astronomers still consider the true nature of the corona to be a mystery. However, there is some evidence that the shape of the corona resembles the Earth's terrain, and seems to depend on the number of dark spots on the sun's surface. When there are many dark spots, the corona is round; when there are very few dark spots, the corona becomes distorted.</p>
<p>So, what exactly are sunspots? These are the "dark spots" that can be seen at any time. These "spots" are themselves bright and hot, at seven thousand degrees. It's just that their temperature is thousands of degrees lower than the main part of the sun's surface. In comparison, they appear darker. Most sunspots are too small to be seen without a magnifying telescope. However, even "small" sunspots are large enough to swallow the entire Earth.</p>
<p>When we know its actual size, it's a bit of an understatement to still call it a "spot." However, the term "spot" has been used historically, so we must adhere to tradition. In photos taken with ordinary telescopes, sunspots do look like tiny spots. This may be due to the different depths of the sunspots, and the light emitted by different elements in the sunspot vortices, which blur the sunspot itself. A better method now is to take photos with a spectroheliograph.</p>
<p>Sunlight can be transformed into a rainbow, and a specific color emitted by a specific element at a specific temperature is most easily sensed by the camera. Therefore, the photographs taken are extremely accurate. From these photographs, sunspots look like giant vortices in the sun's atmosphere. There are similar things on Earth. These are the tropical cyclones drawn on weather maps, emitting wind in a large spiral pattern. Sunspots are like large vortices on the sun. As the swirling gas is drawn into the vortex, it expands and cools, just like steam in a household refrigerator.</p>
<p>So, what is this vortex? It contains no air or moisture, only fine gaseous atoms, and parts of atoms filled with electricity. Magnetism is generated from the rotating electricity. Dr. Hale, the former director of the Mount Wilson Observatory, discovered that sunspots are actually huge electromagnets. Undoubtedly, they must affect the artificial electromagnetic waves transmitted by radio communications.</p>
<p>The number of sunspots varies. Sometimes there are as many as twenty sunspots on the sun at the same time, and sometimes none at all. A century ago, a budding astronomer named Schwabe, a pharmacist by trade, in Dessau, Germany, counted the number of sunspots every day in his spare time, without stopping for many years. He also traced past records and discovered that the waxing and waning of sunspots occurs in cycles of about eleven years. He then used the number of sunspots to create charts, compared to time, which sometimes looked like stock market fluctuations. Many people solemnly say that the cycles of sunspots are the underlying cause of periodic economic panics and prosperity on Earth.</p>
<p>To clarify these claims, let us first describe the "normal" relationship the sun has with us. The sun exerts an average of one kilowatt of power on every square yard of the Earth's surface, which is enough to light all the light bulbs in a large department store. This force draws up seawater and uses wind to propel floating clouds. We know that sunlight has many colors, from red to purple, which can be separated into individual colors from a rainbow. In addition, there are invisible colors, which are infrared rays that feel hot when illuminated, and ultraviolet rays that tan the skin. Some of these rays also charge the upper atmosphere, creating an invisible layer of electricity. Radio waves react to it, which enables wireless radio to broadcast sound across oceans.</p>
<p>Dr. Stetson, the highest authority in sunspot research, has collected much material proving that the ultraviolet component of sunlight varies with the number of sunspots. Since ultraviolet rays can produce vitamins and promote human health, Dr. Stetson predicts that the presence or absence of sunspots may have adverse effects on human nature. In his recent book "Sunspots and Their Effects," Dr. Stetson lists the recent stock market price fluctuations, compared to the number of sunspots.</p>
<p>In 1928, there were many sunspots. In early 1929, market prices rose extremely high. After the number of sunspots decreased, the market plunged dramatically. In 1932, market prices were extremely low, and the number of sunspots in 1933 was also extremely low. After that, both saw increases. The more sunspots, the more active the market. Therefore, speculators should trade according to the sunspots. However, this may just be a fluke. Dr. Stetson believes that people should not arbitrarily assume that this is inevitable or oppose it, because the whole matter still needs to be thoroughly studied. Even if it is found that ground temperature and human nature are indeed related to sunspots, it is still impossible to assert that sunspots are the cause. Sunspots may just be a sign of deeper changes within the sun.</p>
<p>When a new sunspot suddenly appears and grows, magnetic storms are immediately felt on the Earth. Magnetic storms can also generate electricity. Originally, when magnetism is in motion, it produces electric current, which is the principle by which power plants generate electricity. Therefore, when powerful currents generated by magnetic storms pass through man-made electric wires, they absorb telegraph signals and telephone sounds. Magnetic storms emitted by sunspots disrupt the wireless radio wave layer.</p>
<p>In 1938, the number of sunspots almost set a new record. Now is not the period of maximum sunspots in the eleven-year cycle. However, in the past few months, several sunspots larger than usual have appeared. Although the total area they occupy is only half the area of ​​sunspots from 1937 to 1938, wired and wireless communications have been greatly hindered.</p>
<h3 id="e114">A Peace Dawn, according to a French Prophet <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>— Tian Shi</p>
<p>Many modern scientists are dedicated to the study of sunspots. American astronomer Newcomb, based on precise calculations, said that the largest sunspots are seen every eleven years and forty-three days. The main impacts of sunspots on the ground are threefold: earthquakes, extreme cold, and wars. Since the invention of the telescope in 1610, every time a particularly large sunspot has occurred on the sun's surface, the world has experienced a major earthquake. This is probably because the main substance of both the sun and the Earth is iron. When sunspots expand, the electromagnetic force also increases, which may cause the earth's crust to move. Before 1610, there were no telescopes to observe the sky, but like the earthquake that shocked the world in 79 AD, and the disaster in 202 AD, 35 kilometers away from which the sound of the eruption could be heard, the interval was exactly 123 years. If we accurately calculate based on the number of eleven years and forty-three days, then the time when the largest sunspots subsided and reached their maximum again, this is exactly a eleven cycles. Also, like the three periods of extreme cold in Europe and the United States in 1917, 1929, and 1940, the intervals between them were each eleven years, which also happened to coincide with the years when sunspots were at their maximum. Also, my ancient Chinese saying is that governance and chaos are related to celestial phenomena. Recently, French priest and prophet Mura, based on his long-term experience at the observatory, described the process of sunspots increasing and decreasing, and said that major world wars all occurred when these sunspots were increasing upward. This gentleman now judges based on the traces of sunspot ups and downs, and predicts that the world will see peace again before Christmas this year.</p>
<h3 id="e115">The Relationship Between Vietnam and China <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Songshi</p>
<p>What is today called Vietnam includes the five major regions of Tonkin, Laos, Annam, Cochin China, and Cambodia. Before the Sino-French War in 1885, these five regions were collectively called the Kingdom of Annam, which was a tributary state of China.</p>
<p>Vietnam was initially called Nantui (Southern Frontier); history says that Suirenshi traveled to Nantui and invented the art of making fire, which was in this place. Later, it was called Nanjiao (Southern Border); Lu Shi quotes Zhen Yuan Fu, saying that Shennong passed through the land and divided the territories, Nanjiao to the north, and nothing was left unsettled. The Shangshu Yao Dian says that Yao ordered Xishu to reside in Nanjiao. The Shangshu Da Zhuan also says that Yao comforted Jiaozhi in the south, in the southern frontier of Jingzhou in Yu Gong, a desolate place, hence Yue. It is clear that Nantui is Nanjiao.</p>
<p>During the reign of King Cheng of Zhou, the Yuèshāng tribe came from this Vietnamese place to offer tribute. Gujin Zhu says that Duke Zhou achieved great peace, and the Yuèshāng tribe sent interpreters to offer one white pheasant and two black pheasants, and one ivory. The envoy lost his way back, and Duke Zhou bestowed two rolls of patterned silk, and five covered carriages, all with the design of the compass, and had the Yuèshāng tribe carry them south. At that time, Vietnam had obviously already benefited from the culture of the Central Plains.</p>
<p>Emperor Qin Shi Huang opened up the three commanderies of Lingnan, and the so-called Xiang commandery largely included the land of Vietnam. Shiji says that Shi Huang sent criminals and soldiers to garrison the three commanderies. It can be seen that during the Qin Dynasty, Vietnam had already mixed with the Han Chinese in terms of bloodline. Today's Annamese people are just descendants of the Han people.</p>
<p>At that time, the natives of Vietnam were called the Lòuyuè. At the end of the Qin Dynasty, a prince of Shu led 30,000 soldiers, occupied the land, and declared himself King Anyang. Later, Zhao Tuo, the King of Nányuè who dominated outside Lingnan, destroyed Anyang, and Vietnam was once again connected with the regions of today's Guangdong and Guangxi. Yuan Mei has a poem saying, "The Zhao kings and fathers opened the border, relying on a single orchid flower. Three thousand copper crossbows followed the son-in-law, the daughter's heart was too much for her husband's family." It turns out that Zhao Tuo sent his son to pretend to surrender to Anyang, married Anyang's daughter Lánzhū, and annexed the entire territory of Vietnam. There is still such a romantic story.</p>
<p>In the sixth year of the Yuándǐng reign of Emperor Wu of Han, the Zhao family of Nányuè was pacified, and the nine commanderies of Lingnan were established. Vietnam included the three commanderies of Jiaozhi, Jiuzhen, and Rinan. Today's Guangdong and Guangxi and Annam were collectively called Jiaozhou at that time. It was governed from Longbian county, which is today's Hanoi, Vietnam. The importance of Vietnam to China's national defense during the Han Dynasty can be imagined.</p>
<p>During the reign of Emperor Guangwu of the Later Han, the Jiaozhi woman Zhēng Cè slightly rebelled, and General Ma Fubo sent troops to pacify it. He also opened up the territory of Cambodia as the Xianglin county. The former historian Zhang Bo said that the Xianglin county was south of Jiaozhi, where Ma Yuan erected two copper pillars to mark the Han boundary. Yuan returned north and left more than ten households at the copper pillars. By the Sui Dynasty, there were more than three hundred households, all surnamed Ma. The locals thought they were refugees and called them Ma Liúrén, also known as Ma Liúrén. According to the author's research, the modern names Malay, Malaysia, and the Malay Peninsula all originated from this. There is no doubt that the northern Malaysians are mixed with Han Chinese blood. The governance of the entire territory of Vietnam during the two Han Dynasties was no different from that of mainland China.</p>
<p>During the Tang Dynasty, Vietnam belonged to China, and it was no different from the mainland. The construction of the Annam Protectorate was very grand in scale. Unfortunately, the Meng clan of Nanzhao occupied the territory of Yunnan, and the Annam Protectorate was once lost. Later, the Song Dynasty was weak, and the Yuan Dynasty was short-lived, and Annam began to separate from China and become independent, with the Nguyễn, Lê, and Trần families succeeding each other as rulers. However, during these hundreds of years, Annam culture was still always part of Chinese culture.</p>
<p>In the early Ming Dynasty, the Yue city was once again unified by China. During the Yongle period, fifteen prefectures were established in its territory: Jiaozhou, Beijiang, Liangjiang, Sanjiang, Jianping, Xin'an, Jianchang, Fenghua, Qinghua, Zhenman, Liangshan, Xinping, You'an, Shunhua, and Shenghua. Although it was not long, the Lê family usurped power again, but the names of the prefectures and counties at that time are still largely used today. Moreover, from the early Qing Dynasty to 1885, Annam was an extraordinarily obedient tributary state of China. The relationship between Vietnam and China can be said to be extremely close.</p>

<h3 id="e116">Common Problems in Children's Writing <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>— Lu Guanliu</p>
<p>Children are most prone to the following three problems when writing:</p>
<p>The first problem is perfunctory performance. Many children do not understand that writing is an important tool used in daily life, and only consider it a task assigned by the teacher, a homework assigned by the school, so they have to be perfunctory. They are often careless, write a few sentences, do a few lines, and hand in the paper. The handwriting is sloppy and blurry, and the article is meaningless. Writing with this attitude will not lead to progress, even if you do it for a lifetime.</p>
<p>The second problem is intentional plagiarism. Even more children are very dependent. They are unwilling to work hard themselves, but want to take shortcuts. After the teacher's topic appears on the blackboard, they are unwilling to think for themselves, but look around to see how their classmates are starting to write, so they can imitate it? Or ask the teacher: what is the meaning of this topic, hoping the teacher will explain it to them, or even bring a model composition book, flipping through it to see if there is a ready-made model essay that can be copied? Writing with such an intention to rely on others and unwilling to think hard will certainly not lead to progress.</p>
<p>The third problem is easy discouragement. Even more children know the importance of writing and want to improve their writing. At first, they think very carefully and work very hard. But after a few weeks, they do not see any significant progress, so they become discouraged and are unwilling to work hard anymore. In fact, when a person can discover their own shortcomings and feel dissatisfied, they have already made progress. As long as they continue to work hard and intensify their efforts, they can certainly make progress and move forward. You must know that effort is never wasted; one point of effort yields one point of achievement. As the ancients said, "As long as you put in enough effort, an iron bar can be ground into a needle." It can be seen that as long as you are willing to work hard, there is no reason not to make progress and not to succeed.</p>
<p>"Only you know your own illness," "Only you know your own illness." Only you know if you have the above problems when writing. If there is a problem with your body, you must consult a doctor, prescribe medicine, and take it to restore your health. If you find a problem with your writing, you must also consult a doctor, but this "doctor" is "yourself." You must diagnose yourself, prescribe your own medicine, and correct yourself to restore the health of your writing.</p>
<p>Shenbao is holding a summer composition competition during the summer vacation, which is no different from organizing a summer writing health camp for children, so that children who have problems with writing can use their free time during the holidays to restore the health of their writing. Children who do not have writing problems in the first place can also further improve the health of their writing. Children, don't miss this good opportunity.</p>
<h3 id="e117">The Small Threshold of Writing <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Yu</p>
<p>Some children, as soon as they receive the composition topic, rush to write. After writing once, they feel it is wrong, completely erase it, and rewrite it. It takes time and energy, and the writing grade is still not good. This is not because your level is not good, you just haven't understood the threshold of writing!</p>
<p>First, determine the meaning. For example, if the school has held a civility week, the teacher may give a composition topic about civility, teaching you to write some chronicles of civility week, which you can barely cope with. If it contains some reasoning, you will not know where to start. In fact, you only need to think about the facts first. What is the most meaningful thing during civility week? What is the most successful thing? What is still not enough? Don't you have three levels of meaning? Secondly, think outside the topic, everyone is casual, isn't it more meaningful to write freely, why do you want to talk about civility? When you grow up and become an adult, why is it inappropriate to talk about civility again? Don't you have two more levels of meaning? Then, think inside the topic, how to understand civility? How to know civility? How to practice civility? How to get used to civility? Don't you have four more levels of meaning?</p>
<p>Second, arrange the order. Arrange the above nine levels of meaning in an order, or make the chronicle the main point and the discussion the secondary point, describe the chronicle in more detail and the theory in less detail; or make the theory the main point and the chronicle the secondary point, put the theory in front and describe it in more detail, and put the chronicle in the back and describe it in less detail; first make a list of the general idea, and although the words have not been written out, the levels are already well-organized.</p>
<p>Third, start writing. Write layer by layer according to the outline list. The sentences should be short and the meaning should be clear. Write it as you go, and you will have an excellent piece of writing, because you have already completed the three requirements of writing, which are rich meaning, clear levels, and clear words and sentences.</p>
<p>Children, try using these small thresholds of writing and the composition topics of the summer homework competition, and I believe your writing grades will be much better than usual!</p>
<h3 id="e118">Making Your Own Refrigerator (Part 2) <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>— Jin Zhen</p>
<p>"Brother, why do we need so many things? We've never seen sawdust in ordinary refrigerators."</p>
<p>"The sheet metal is nailed to the outside of the wooden box, and the sheet metal must be brand new and shiny, so that it can reflect heat and prevent hot air from entering the box. The putty is to prevent hot air from entering or cold air from escaping between the gaps. The sawdust is something that doesn't conduct heat very well, so that the kerosene can doesn't come into contact with the wooden box, which is to isolate the air inside and outside the box. This is the same function as the vacuum layer in a thermos bottle."</p>
<p>"So how do we use it?"</p>
<p>Ice and the items to be refrigerated are placed together in the kerosene can, so we have to wrap the items to be refrigerated so that they don't come into direct contact with the ice. This is more troublesome, but many people habitually put things on the ice, for example, putting fruit on top of the ice. In fact, this is wrong, because the air that has been cooled on the ice will sink to the bottom, and the surrounding hot air will rise. So if we want to cool things, we should put them under the ice, because there is cold air under the ice. If you put water on the ice, then only the bottom layer of the water is cooled, and the rest of the water is still surrounded by uncooled air. If you put it under the ice, the water will cool down quickly. What is the reason for this? Because when the upper layer of water is cooled by the ice, it sinks to the bottom of the cup, and the hotter water rises up, until all the water in the cup is cooled. At the same time, the cold air around the ice can also sink down and surround the cup, so most refrigerators in the room put the ice on top, not on the bottom. If you put it on the bottom, it will of course cool things down, but it will be much slower. Conversely, if we want to boil hot water, putting the kettle on the fire is the right thing to do, because the air that is burned by the fire is greatly reduced, squeezed out from all sides of the kettle and runs upward, so that the water in the kettle boils quickly.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Shirley Temple's Autobiography (Part 9) <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>— Min</p>
<p>Finally, Mr. Raymond came to visit us. He said that I would be cast as the female lead, Shalme, in the first film. If I performed well in this first film, I would be given the lead role in other films in the future. Dad was so happy when he heard the good news, he said that movies are a miraculous thing, and he would have to watch every movie starring his daughter, and watch it carefully. Later, Dad did keep his promise. He really watched every one of my movies, and even watched some of them more than ten times.</p>
<p>I starred in so many movies that people called me a movie veteran. Jane Ganor also has a flat in the studio, separated from my flat by a street, facing each other. A few days ago, she came to my place. She said that she had recorded every movie I had starred in, and that I had starred in eight big movies in the past two years. She also said to me, "Your achievement has surpassed that of the average adult star, Shirley, you are really a champion!"</p>
<p>Now I want to tell you about my acting experience. It's really not a difficult thing, it's much easier than reading, writing, or doing arithmetic. It's like a kind of pretending trick. In my opinion, it's the easiest trick in the world to play. Do you remember that I told you before that I used to ride my tricycle</p>
<p>to the eucalyptus tree at the end of the garden, and pretend that I was on my way to Chicago? What's more, I pretended, but I might as well be confident that it was really happening. After a while, you won't feel any difference between reality and fiction. Your performance in the movie is the same. For example, you pretend that you are not Shirley Temple, but a little general or another girl. You just need to forget yourself, and pretend so realistically that you will soon not feel that you are pretending, but that you are a little general or another girl.</p>
<p>I think anyone can do this. Even if I'm not starring in a movie, but just playing a pretending game myself, it's not impossible. From the small corridor of my flat, I can see a big ship at the end of the studio street. It's actually not a real ship, it's completely fake. There's no river or sea there either, not even a drop of water. They sometimes use it when making movies. On the screen, it looks exactly like the real thing. To be honest with you, this ship only has a flat hull that can be seen from the front, but there's nothing behind it. I often stand there and pretend that I'm taking this ship on a long trip to various places. Ah, pretending is really the most fun trick!"</p>
<h3 id="e120">The Life of a Frog <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>— Lu Lishi</p>
<p>In early summer, we can hear a croaking sound in ponds and swamps, which is the sound of frogs helping farmers eliminate pests.</p>
<p>In winter, they hibernate underground, neither eating nor moving. When spring arrives, they go to the ponds to mate. Both males and females make loud calls. The male frog, because it has an air sac, croaks even louder. After the female lays her eggs, she leaves the pond and lives on land. The laid eggs soon float to the surface of the water, appearing as a gelatinous crystalline mass, numbering about one to two thousand, each hidden in the gelatinous substance.</p>
<p>Soon after, the round eggs change, and the future tadpole's torso can be seen. Later, we see it grow a tail, and then separate from the gelatinous substance to become a tadpole. From egg to tadpole takes two weeks. Before the tadpole grows a mouth, it still relies on the nutrients in the egg to sustain its life. Gradually, the tadpole grows a mouth and uses plants as food, and is able to swim everywhere.</p>
<p>The tadpole first breathes through gills, and later grows lungs to replace them. At that time, the tadpole often floats to the surface of the water to breathe air. Then, it gradually grows limbs, the hind legs growing first, and the front legs growing later. At this time, the tadpole still has a tail. Strangely, if the tadpole cannot obtain external food, it eats its own tail. In this way, the legs grow larger, and it becomes a complete frog, leaving the pond to live its terrestrial life.</p>

<p>— Zhu Mingyi</p>
<p>Children, the summer vacation of the 29th year is coming! I think this hope can give you some comfort in the heavy examinations; you must be thinking about how to have fun during this more than two-month vacation. But I hope you will consider first, before solving this idea, whether you are satisfied with the knowledge and grades you have obtained this year. I believe that knowledge is endless, so everyone must feel that it is not enough, especially us, in this era.</p>
<p>The summer vacation, which is used for rest, occupies a long time of the whole year; calculating by the unit of time, it is also very long; about one thousand six hundred hours. Even if calculated by working hours, it is more than six hundred hours. It is a pity to let such a long time escape in a muddle! Especially for us students, we feel even more sorry. If we use it for research or reviewing homework, it will definitely be very effective for the progress of our studies; and it can also lay the foundation for the next semester's studies. On the other hand, if we only know how to spend time in a playful way; undoubtedly, there will be no good grades in the next semester. It's like the ancient saying: "Review the old and know the new," "If you don't advance, you will retreat."</p>
<p>Children, I hope you remember the saying "Achieve great success in difficulty." Use a hard spirit to strive for our success in graduation.</p>

<h3 id="e122">Revolution in Hollywood Film Production – Four Major Companies Implement New System <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Fu</p>
<p>The long-rumored bloodless revolution in the film industry has broken out. Warner Bros., RKO, Universal, and Columbia, four major companies, have begun to adopt the new system of "group production" - many independent producers, under the banner of large companies, use their technical equipment and talents to produce excellent products at a lower cost.</p>
<p>Warner Bros. has absorbed outside talent under this system. Recently, they signed contracts with George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart. The resulting works already include "The Man Who Came to Dinner." The addition of the American Musicians' Association to RKO is expected in the near future.</p>
<p>Most filmmakers believe that the new system of "group production" can solve many production difficulties. Under the huge production system, talent is often buried. The implementation of the new system will probably bring us better movies.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Increasing Rift Between Xinhua and Guohua <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Currently, Xinhua is simultaneously producing as many as nine folk films. Among them, Guohua has also indicated that it is producing "Du Shi Niang," "Pearl Pagoda," and "Jade Dragonfly." Yesterday, news spread in the film industry that Guohua is also simultaneously producing the other six films, including "Emerald Hairpin," "Gilded Phoenix," "Double Pearl Phoenix," "Courtesan," "Crafty Liu Shi," and "Wang Laohu Snatching a Bride." It is said that everything is very secret, as if the Allied countries in the European War are deeply afraid of the infiltration of a "fifth column."</p>
<p>The Haixing News Agency reporter has always regretted the act of competing head-on. Even from a purely business standpoint, both sides are bound to be hurt. Moreover, the impact goes beyond this. At the beginning of the "Three Smiles" dual-package case, the Haixing News Agency repeatedly appealed, hoping that film companies would have a proper solution for the future of the film industry. The guild has now made its final effort, but it has been ineffective. How it will develop in the future is difficult to predict. Thinking about it, I can't help but sigh.</p>

<p>— Lin Guangqing</p>
<p>Eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind are the six roots; form, sound, smell, taste, touch, and dharma are the six dusts. Buddhists emphasize the purity of the six roots, unstained by any dust. I can't do it, and I don't want to say a few mantras to deceive myself. I emphasize first doing no evil, not harming others to benefit oneself, even less harming others without benefiting oneself, nor am I willing to harm oneself to benefit others. At the same time, I like to be stained by all six dusts and enjoy all six roots. When I watch the plays of Mei Lanfang and Cheng Yanqiu, my ears are pleased, my eyes are pleased, and my mind is even more pleased; my nose and tongue are abandoned, and my body is forgotten as if in shackles. When I watch the plays of Ma Lianliang and Xi Xiaobo, the pleasure of my ears and eyes is not enough to make me forget the suffering of sitting in the theater. My mouth suddenly feels dry, and when the tea runs out, I expect water to arrive, and thus a feeling arises that suffering cannot overcome pleasure. When I watch some family's modernized Peking Opera with ever-changing mechanisms and continuous playing of five tones, my nose feels a foul odor, my body suffers squeezing, my head is dizzy and I sweat, and I feel impatient and agitated. I look but cannot distinguish its color, I listen but cannot discern its sound, and my constitution is weak and cannot bear it.</p>
<p>Now there is a place, if you enter it, what your eyes see are the colors of powder, white, and dark cosmetics; what your ears hear are the sounds of qin, drums, and strings; what your nose smells are the fragrances of all sorts; what your tongue tastes are the sweet and cool flavors that soothe the spleen; what your body touches is soft jade and warm fragrance, embracing in your arms. Whether you sit, stand, move, or stop, you are free to do as you please, and you may feel a cool breeze or a chilling air. And your mind will follow your body's pleasure. What is this place? Is it worth lingering in?</p>
<p>After a long rain, the bottle flowers seem to smile. Sitting alone in my study, sipping clear tea, exhaling light puffs, and occasionally perusing travel journals, a guest came and told me such things, so I dipped my brush and wrote them down. But lingering leads to delusion, and continuing leads to ruin. How is it better than understanding the realm and not being attached to it? The guest said, "I was just criticizing mantras, and now your words are approaching them?"</p>
<h3 id="e125">Recent Situation of Mei Wan-hua in Hong Kong – Letter from a Cousin – Many Sentiments Between the Lines – Great Poverty and Small Poverty are No Different in the North and South <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>— Xie</p>
<p>Mei Lanfang has been in Hong Kong for a long time, and he usually rents a small building with his close friends Feng Gengguang and others, spending all day befriending trees and rocks, and enjoying poetry and books. Initially, due to invitations from various parties requesting him to perform on stage, Mei once grew his hair long and became lazy in grooming. He was full of thoughts and took swimming as a pastime, sitting on the beach, bathing in the sun yesterday. Over time, his face became dark and no longer had its former charm. Some days ago, he sent a letter to Qin Yongshu in Beiping. Qin is Mei Lang's cousin. From it, we can know Mei's recent situation in Hong Kong. The original letter roughly states, "Yongshu, my dear cousin, I have been separated for a long time. I received your letter and learned that you are safe and well, which is comforting. I personally delivered the package of tea leaves from Mr. Tian Zongqi to him. They are very rare here, and greatly needed when one is away from home. I am extremely grateful to receive them as if I had found a treasure. Mr. Tian is a good conversationalist, and does not tire even after a long time. He told me about the situation in the north in great detail. The economic difficulties of relatives and friends and colleagues were long expected. At the same time, prices are high and life is oppressive. There is no difference between the north and the south, so that whether one is greatly poor or slightly poor, they will ultimately go to the same end. Seeing that I have been living in Hong Kong for two years, I also feel the pain of life. Since the outbreak of the European War, this place has become even more difficult to live in. In recent years, I have declined social engagements and lead a simple life. Occasionally, when I go out, I can only stroll in the mountains. When guests arrive, we can only have a clear conversation. Everything else is avoided. Because the cost of a meal is easily dozens of yuan. If converted into national currency, it would be more than two or three hundred yuan. Even the cheapest Sichuan restaurant in Chunhua Building, which is six yuan per person, is not available. I had previously heard the tragic news about my brother Huifang in Chongqing. After checking with people from the Li Family Opera Troupe, I learned that he is still alive. At this time, he may have gone to Chengdu, or he may have gone elsewhere. There is no definite information. The Li Family Opera Troupe is now in Kunming. Brother Hui left the troupe due to disagreements. The grand situation of the capital's singing stages is broadcast every night. It is heard clearly. Who is performing, who is playing the strings, and who is cheering is as clear as if they were right in front of me. Modern machines have become effective tools for propaganda. They are great and beneficial to people, whether they are here or there. With this, I pay my respects and wish you well. Your cousin Mei Lan sends his regards. June 11th."</p>

<p>He continued, "Miss Jiang really didn't make any indication?"</p>
<p>Jinmei glanced at Hawthorne, still lowering her head, and stammered, "No."</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou also noticed that the maid's attitude was not very natural. Based on my experience, I could also see that she was clearly hiding something.</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou said, "Be careful! If you try to be clever in front of us, you'll only suffer for it! I advise you to tell the truth."</p>
<p>The maid's head seemed very heavy, still unable to lift it. Hawthorne's powerful gaze remained fixed on her without blinking. Although she did not look up, she must have felt these two stern gazes making an invisible attack on her. But her expression was still very calm, without any trembling or fear.</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou urged again, "If you're not willing to say it here, then we'll have to let you say it at the police station!"</p>
<p>Hawthorne still said gently, "If you have any concerns, we can guarantee you. You don't have to be afraid."</p>
<p>Jinmei finally replied in a low voice, "It's not that. It's just that - it's actually just her casual guess, and it can't be considered accurate. It's best if you ask her yourselves, I don't want to be a busybody."</p>
<p>Hawthorne said, "This isn't being a busybody. What you saw and heard, you should tell us completely. This is your duty to the law."</p>
<p>She paused, and then said, "Miss Jiang said - this matter might be - done by Young Master Yu." (30)</p>
