<p>社評</p>
<h3>如何重建世界秩序</h3>
<p>近來接踵而起的種種事變，世界幾乎整個墜入擾攘的深淵，使最大多數的民族和人民備嘗着生活上與精神上的無匹痛苦。而惟少數以征服與支配爲事者，趾高氣揚。在歷史上雖也不難找到類似的經歷，而目前這種種事變的範圍和影響，則逈非往昔任何先例所能比擬。</p>
<p>這等局勢的形成，最大多數的人們固都至感痛心，但在征服與支配的遂行者，也未嘗不有其論據：例如謂『這是「有」與「無」的爭鬥』，『這是爲了遂行區域的安全』，『這是爲了促進世界秩序與和平』，『這是實行改造世界的方案』。與這種論據相對立的。是力量而不是理論；何况一切手段都告失敗而終於不能不訴之戰爭的關頭，理論上的爭論更屬决要問題。雖然，擾攘的深淵究竟祇是一時的變態現象；人類正常的要求究竟不是擾攘而是長治久安；因之，世界秩序如何纔能眞正建立，也就成爲不能不加以嚴重攷慮的課題。</p>
<p>希望維繫長治久安的一種秩序，必須建立在絕對平等的基礎之上，纔能有效；而且其參加者也必須是出於自發的願望，不是被迫而出於無可奈何，如果完全由於武力的凌逼，抑或只是遂行支配者的意欲，則即使勉强造成一種表面秩序也斷難獲得安定和持久；其內部矛盾因素的存在，縱即暫時相安，最後也必然要引導到新的衝突或變亂的爆發。就當前的事例來看：凡爾賽條的何嘗不曾一度帶來秩序與和平，然而另一方面，却正因爲缺乏上述的基本考慮，以致適成爲此度歐戰以及近頃若于糾紛的導火綫。這一類的例證在歷史上眞是數不勝數；所憾未能深切發揮其敎訓的效果，反而有人變本加厲，說秩序與和平可以在征服與支配之下建立起來，，這根本是一種支配者的邏輯。</p>
<p>在人與人之間，往昔也有過一階段，容許强凌弱衆暴寡的現象存在。但終於隨着人類文明而進步，在今日的社會中間，大體說來，已經是每一個人都具有同樣的生存權利與自由。而在國與國之間，却至今還遺留着野蠻時代的傳統，弱小國家竟始終不能獲得生存自由的保障，有時橫受凌逼，有時慘遭犧牲，有時其生存也竟遇到危脅；却找不到一個地方可以接受其申訴並予以有力有效的聲援。這是今日國際間最不合理事態之一，同時也就是某一些戰爭發生的主因。弱小國家而隸屬於强者支配之下，那不惟不足以保障弱小的安全，反而更促進另一種戰爭—爭奪霸權的戰爭—的危險。把世界重新分割，也無非等於把國際間的敵對勢力劃分得更尖銳更顯明，因之未來的戰禍也就更可怖。所以欲圖重新建立世界的秩序，必須首先使弱者與强者具有同樣的生存權利，實現絕對平等與自由，並把一切征服和支配現象祛除淨盡。這都是最起碼的條件，離開這一基本前提而侈談秩序，不是愚昧，就是欺騙。</p>
<p>在這暴力橫行正義避匿的今日，人類浩刧正不知幾時纔是止境，所以也只有運用實力對黑暗鬥爭纔是解決一切問題的唯一途徑；但上面所述却是值得時刻服膺的基本信念。只要這世界還不主因橫暴之來而竟歸沉淪，則未來國際秩序的重建，必以弱小者的由挣扎而獲自由平等的生存爲光明的始基。</p>

<p>匈京　此間空氣昨日大轉和緩、因權威界報告謂、義大利已勸告匈牙利及保加利亞稍加忍耐、待英國被擊敗後、始向羅馬尼亞提出要求、官塲認爲柏林方面已告知羅馬、謂多瑙河之要求目前應暫展緩、至英國屈膝以後始提出、以避免與羅馬尼亞或蘇聯發生衝突、（三十日合衆電）</p>
<p>羅京　羅馬尼亞兵士二百萬人、昨已準備反抗任何企圖分割該國土地之威脅、惟官方則謂、此時尚無戰爭之危險、據昨晚未證實而可靠之消息稱、羅國王卡洛爾昨在羅馬、正盼義相墨索里尼阻止匈牙利及保加利亞之行動、昨晚權威方面對合衆社記者云、關於蘇聯進兵比薩拉比亞及北布柯維納省事，德義並未給與羅國保證、因羅國已接受蘇聯完全尊重羅國邊界之諾言、軸心國家、已認無予羅國保證之必要、昨羅馬尼亞軍隊已開抵其新邊境、（三十日合衆電）</p>
<p>羅京　此間官塲否認國外報載蘇聯要求多瑙河與黑海根據地之消息、並否認羅匈邊界與羅保邊界皆發生衝突之謠言、羅國報紙對於比薩拉比亞與布柯維那之喪失、咸認爲無可奈何之事、親德之「時事報」希望羅國現所喪失者、不久可藉德國之援助而恢復之、政界人士咸恐蘇聯之要求、將擴展至黑海及韃靼海峽方面、據一部份人士之意見、羅馬尼亞將暫時徇從蘇聯之要求、而一方面迅速增强其與德國之政治、經濟及軍事合作、（三十日路透電）</p>
<p>蘇菲亞　保加利亞昨對羅馬尼亞之動員、仍守鎭靜、而權威方面亦告合衆社記者、謂保加利亞並未動員、保國現時之武裝軍隊究有多少、官方拒不發表、而非官方之估計、則言人人殊有一百萬者、亦有謂二百萬者、保國政府似仍將採用和平手段，以遂其土地之要求、據某接近政府之人士語合衆社記者云，「吾人不惟不能藉武力以收回多不魯甲、且吾人亦絕無施用武力以遂所願之意、然吾人相信吾人苟能忍耐、可以和平方法收回該地、况吾人深知吾人此項要求、甚屬公正、目下吾人之主旨卽在避免戰爭」云、（三十日合衆電）</p>
<p>羅境紅軍賡續推進　全部佔領羅割讓區</p>

<p>羅京　宣傳部公佈稱、蘇羅新疆界與羅國歐戰前之北部界綫相同、由蘇波邊界沿薩西華河至歐戰前之界綫、而由普魯特河向南以至多瑙河而入黑海、（三十日合衆電）</p>
<p>羅馬尼亞忍痛割地　正義必有重伸一日</p>
<p>羅京　羅國新任宜傳部長薛多里維西、昨對報界談話、認蘇聯佔領比薩拉比亞及布柯維納、爲羅國之「災禍」、且係一不公正之舉、然彼又認蘇聯此舉、已將未來東南歐洲更大之災禍消弭、薛氏稱、「吾人之忍受此項災禍、蓋爲免除更大之災禍、雖吾人受一極不公正之待遇、吾人並不感覺失望、吾人業已遭受苦痛、而仍將含辛茹苦、未來之時日終將以正義畀與否等、吾人將聯合吾人一切勢力、以從事吾人之神聖使命、必至此一不公正之事實、獲得糾正而後止」、（三十日合衆電）</p>
<h3>倫敦泰晤士報　論巴爾幹局勢　三國窺伺爾虞我詐　蘇聯行動早着先鞭</h3>
<p>倫敦　星期日「泰晤士報」對於此次蘇聯進佔比薩拉比亞、是否係獲得德方之同意一節、表示懷疑、該報於「蘇聯之行動」一文內、謂自法國崩潰以後、希特勒最可能行動之一、卽爲向東進取、史丹林亟思着共先鞭、故此次斷然併吞比薩拉比亞、並加緊其對於波羅的海各國之把持、惟巴爾幹實爲較波羅的海更含有爆炸性之區域、由羅馬尼亞以至希獵之各國、已形成德義蘇三國各有單獨及互相衝突利益之區域、迄今此三國似尚無在一種瓜分計劃之下已臻於妥協之徵象、彼等最後自或將有此妥協之日、但據目前之情形而觀、德義對於蘇聯之行動、似皆出於意外、且不表示歡迎也、今有三猫環立於所獲食物之前、互相窺伺、如共中之一突然伸爪攫取、其他二者勢必隨之、此事之反響、不久或將波及吾人之協約國土耳其、倘使該國早積極加入我方、則其所處之地位必將遠强於今日云、又有嘉爾文氏亦對此事在視察報中發表一文、內稱、吾人現正目擊羅馬尼亞問題之開始而非終了、此一戲劇之內容殊爲複雜、或將有若干分幕及休息、蘇聯對目前固無情感作用、對於將來亦無所謂幻想、不過一有機會卽爲其所應爲而已、同時蘇聯之目光頗爲深遠、欲與兩軸心國家作戰、則無論在目前或日後皆非其目的也、如認爲不然、則誠慇懃思想者之罔識也、「我之奮鬥」中較基本的原則及其中較大之決議、僅能依最後的規模重作「向東開拓」而實現之、此卽偉大的條頓開拓、由巴爾幹而達高加索與巴庫是也、德國在西歐與北歐所作之大侵略、就蘇聯利益論、已進行過連而過遠。故限制義大利在巴爾幹之活動、實屬必要、法國之崩潰與蘇聯之勸告、已使土耳其立於戰局之外矣、惟就顯明之狀態論、土耳其之防務、絲毫不因軸心强國而將轉弱、韃靼與博斯普魯斯兩海峽不得以直接或間接之方法危脅之、叙利亞與巴力斯坦不得落入義國掌握、此種狀態非無益於英國、彼等實爲地中海東部之保障、以，止騷亂之蔓延、俄國之處於蘇維埃制下、如昔處於帝制下然、茲已復爲一切斯拉夫人之希望所繫矣、此將爲抵抗謀使斯拉夫族降於劣位之納粹主義之基本的本能、希特勒謀圖變更愈甚、則渠之仍如舊態亦愈甚、希氏今僅變更其手設與其程序之次第而已、「我之奮鬥」中數種可畏的原則、屬於其心思與目的之固定的基礎、希氏將以强權與種族的卓越、建造歷史上所未前觀之大帝國、此必使之堅固建立、而在今後多世紀中長保霸權、而不能予以擊破、爲達此目的起見、凡虛其左近之每一可能的勁敵、必須打倒之、而使不能復振、羅馬尼亞所產油與糧食尚、永不足以成之、空前的幻想與長久的稱霸、必需及烏克蘭之沃土與巴庫之油礦也、（三十日路透社電）</p>
<h3>蘇聯維護　和平政策　蘇羅懸案解決　於此獲一明證</h3>
<p>莫斯科　關於蘇軍開入羅馬尼亞事、「消息報」頃評云、「昨日下午二時、吾英勇紅軍開始越過羅馬尼亞邊境、查此項邊境、係歐西帝國主義之陰謀及策動而造成、蘇聯從未予以承認、紅軍開入比薩拉比亞及北布柯維納、並不以征服者自居、彼等絕非該地人民之敵、實際上彼等確係被迫脫離祖國者之友人、紅軍在羅境前進、備受人民歡迎、此係蘇聯和平政策及蘇羅糾紛和平解決之直接結果、蘇羅對比薩拉比亞之糾紛、已有二十二年之久、查比薩拉比亞之脫離蘇聯、凡爾賽勝利者曾直接參與其事、彼等利用蘇聯革命後軍事力量之薄弱、曾以種種方法削弱蘇聯之實力、同時蘇聯反動份子亦參與其事、蓋彼等祇顧全彼等破產階級之利益、而置祖國生死存亡於不顧也、羅馬尼亞攫奪比薩拉比亞、係根據某團體之決定、此自命爲團體之團體、實際上與比薩拉比亞人民並無關係、該「團體」共有會員一六二人、但竟以三十八票而決定併吞比薩拉比亞、蘇聯對於此種不公尤及破壞行動、從未予以承認，在二十二年中、蘇聯屢次提及解決比薩拉比亞間題之重要、最近在蘇聯最高蘇維埃第六屆大會中、蘇聯人民委員會委長莫洛托夫亦會提及此項問題、蘇聯對用武力收還比薩拉比亞雖從未加以提及，但對於該地被羅方奪去、則亦未予以承認、自莫洛托夫發表該項演說後、蘇聯卽遣派公使至羅京、（按當時蘇聯駐羅公使已離任兩年半）蘇聯認爲該問題之延不解決、並非羅方本身之錯誤、因此蘇方擬以純粹和平方法解決之、顯明的兩隣邦糾紛之解決、對於和平當係極大之貢獻、目前蘇羅所成立之協定、就維護和平而言、尤爲有價值、良以該項糾紛之性質及延長、殊有阻礙兩國之友好關係也，矧該協定係在國際局面最複雜時簽訂、故尤覺其價值連城、戰爭之烽火已延及各國、吾人目覩無數之重要歷史變動、由帝國主義造成之國際矛盾結節、已由刀槍所戮破、在此環境下、蘇聯仍繼續其和平政策、卽不公尤如比蕯拉比亞問題、蘇聯亦不願訴諸武力、雖然、該問題之需要迅速解決、則極明顯、凡在雙方同意而解決之糾紛、必可鞏固各列强之和平、蘇羅協定已完全符合上項情形、該協定非特已解決比薩拉比亞問題、且已解決與該問題有連帶關係之北布柯維納問題、北布柯維納無論在語言及組構上、均與蘇維埃烏克蘭有密切之關係、自奧匈帝政崩潰後、布柯維納工農卽要求將布省併入蘇維埃烏克蘭此項要求曾由當時該地之國民大會所提出、總之、布省之歸併羅馬尼亞、亦係當時萬能之小協商國所策動、所謂羅馬尼亞人一致要求併吞布柯維納、實係僞造、由是觀之、蘇羅糾紛之解決、亦卽又一不公尤歷史事件之解決、况羅馬尼亞統治比薩拉比亞二十二年、蘇方損失甚大、北布柯維納之移交蘇聯、可作爲補償蘇方損失之用、無論蘇聯抑或比薩拉比亞民衆、均反對比省由羅方統治、彼等在二十二年統治下、已備受壓迫及困苦矣、關於此點、可由比省人民屢次起事加以證明、蘇聯現已爲比薩拉比亞及北布柯維納闢一偉大的社會主義途徑、彼等將與蘇維埃弟兄携手前進、受史丹林憲法及偉大紅軍之保護、無疑的過去之窮困業已消逝、此後比薩拉此亞及北布柯維納民衆將享受愉快安樂之生活、在資本主義鮮血戰塲中、偉大的蘇聯爲順從民衆及領袖之意志、仍置身事外、蘇聯現正努力解決一切糾紛、藉以消弭星火燎原之患、雖然蘇聯係以其本身方法、解決一切糾紛、蘇羅事件之解決、卽爲明證、蘇聯勞動大衆此次除向比薩拉比亞及北布柯維納人民祝賀外、並向賢明的和平史丹林政策表示擁戴、蓋苟無此種賢明之指導、決無如此良好之成績也、」（三十日塔斯电）</p>

<h3>日軍圖窺越南　日艦結集防城海面　越港貨運忽告中斷</h3>
<p>香港通信、邇來此間迭傳日本秉歐戰風雲動盪時機、圖窺越南、證以粤省南路及汕厦方面所報告日軍之動態、亦殊可信、特日軍能吾得逞、茲難預斷耳、據聞瓊崖潤洲兩島沿海及東京灣一帶、在五月下旬以前、日方艦隊祗有航空母艦一艘、大小戰艦二十餘艘、均爲第十一艦隊所屬、</p>
<p>日艦驟增</p>
<p>自六月上旬起、日艦卽大量增加、約達九十餘艘之多、分佈於防城海面以至瓊崖島之東南面、所有獨洲嶺·南榕嶺·三洲島·東羅島·西鼓島等、盡被佔領、並運到大批軍實、躉存於榆林·三亞·淸瀾·洋浦·各港灣同時有日艇在各該港灣分頭經營建築疏濬等工作、榆林港則有潛艇駛進、至於結集於瓊崖島之陸上日軍、亦陸續增加、約有三萬餘衆、除以一部應付當地華方游擊隊外、大都實施訓練爬山戰術及演習汽球升空等、日軍最高司令官西尾壽造、曾於十一日到達瓊崖視察對於擴築機塲軍港倉庫等重要設備、均有所指示、顯見其以瓊崖島爲軍事之根據地、亦無異實施其南進政策以越南爲對象也、</p>
<p>企圖進犯</p>
<p>防城海面日艦、十六日裝載日兵集中邁尾島、企圖沿江平墟直犯東興、經該處華軍沉着迎擊、日軍始不得逞、十七日又有日艦駛抵白龍尾、向華軍進襲、仍被華軍擊退、查東興白龍尾等處、皆密邇越南、日軍是舉、其爲威脅越南殆無疑義、故越南當局卽密切注意、越境之　街、亦結集越兵、預爲應付、又欽城日軍、月前增加萬餘、原係準備東犯、側攻西江華軍之綫、現均撤往瓊崖·周洲兩島、亦是預爲窺伺越南、</p>
<p>港越交通</p>
<p>在日軍窺伺越南之中、法國政府、忽接受日方提出不准中外貨物運經海防與河內之要求、越甫當局、遂決於二十日起、切實遵行、而直接遭受影響、厥爲越港運輸業、以其卽告停頓也、溯粤桂戰事發生後、中國國產如桐油蠶絲猪鬃毛等之出口路綫、大都係經滇越鐵路運至越南、轉到香港集中外銷、而歐美貨物及香港產品、亦多經港越轉運內地、故越南實成爲中外貨物出納重要孔道、而其貨運之數量、亦復甚鉅、茲因運輸停頓、各運輸公司、損失甚爲重大、其中積存在港待運入內地之貨物、約値港幣二百萬元以上、又躉存越南不能運輸來港之貨物、亦受同樣打擊、而香港所需食料如牲口米石等、亦向恃越南及康洲灣之接濟、目下勢有中斷之虞、故價格隨而高漲、至由港開往越南之船隻、屬於英商者、尙照常行駛、屬於法商者、自二十二日起、則完全停止、殆因遵守日方對法要求之故、是日赴越南之乘客、已登法商輪船者、均臨時改乘英商輪船前往、故港越貨運雖停頓、而旅客尚可往還者、祇賴少數英商輪船之聯繫而已、</p>
<h3>粵省北江激戰　華軍收復從化　日軍退守新街</h3>
<p>香港通信、粤省北江戰事、沉寂已久、延至五月中旬、日軍乃陸續調集盤踞於花縣從化一帶之部隊、冀圖侵犯琶江、自五月二十一日至一五日、即在良口西北之峯火嶺、發生混戰、石嶺及芝寨琶江田心村逕口等處、亦發生戰事、至二十七日、日軍復以飛機十二架爲掩護、衝破華軍獅逕陣地、後經華軍反攻、又將之擊退、並俘虜日軍一批、即送交粤北收管、本月初旬起、該方面戰事、愈趨激烈、華軍於五日晨、一路攻克黑山、一路攻克街口、日軍當由和睦逕及神岡趕調增援、計達三千餘人、其番號爲松尾聯隊、七日午與華軍發生遭遇戰、日軍死傷甚衆、</p>
<p>攻克從化　　八日晨、從化墟口各地、日軍又增至四千餘人、藉飛機大砲掩護分三路向華軍反撲、來勢甚兇、華軍乃全綫向北略移、但仍在鷄籠崗方面作拉鋸戰、九日、華軍始將鷄籠崗收復、鷄籠崗以南之佛子坳黑山一帶、發現日軍遺屍五百餘具、其中有日軍官三員爲少佐大隊長宮澤·及中尉隊長藤島。伊藤等、華軍自是以後、即向從化縣城猛進、至十二日、父將該縣城收復、並乘日軍兵疲力盡、攻擊廣州外圍、但雙方之主力仍在神岡及太平塲方面、</p>
<p>收復龍口</p>
<p>花縣日軍、七日下午、曾以五百餘衆由龍口向平山進犯、華軍某部、略向後退、籍引日軍深入平山以北地區、日軍果中其計、華軍當以奇兵截其歸路、日軍傷亡甚重、華軍即收復龍口、直達石角、九日、兩軍在石角互相衝鋒搏戰、日軍敗退新街三羊店等地、　華軍已將新街一帶、加以控制、十三日傍晚、華軍某部、復分兩路進攻龍翔、當由西北郊攻入墟內、與日軍更番肉搏、斃日軍百餘、人和鴉湖各地日軍聆訊、急忙增援、但華軍將士、不稍畏餒、繼續撲擊、十四日、雙方仍在龍翔近郊相持中、</p>
<p>廣州不安</p>
<p>自北江華軍收復從化縣城後廣州外圍、勢被威脅、故四郊之西村白雲出三元里河南寳崗士敏土廠各處、日軍均加重兵、各路要口、亦加派哨崗、並澈夜以鐵甲車巡邏各馬路、每晚七時後、禁絕行人來往、各客棧旅店、每晚均有日憲兵及偽警搜查情形極爲嚴重、</p>
<h3>歐洲無線電播音戰</h3>
<p>德國人對英廣播，比了英國廣播公司的對德宣傳，每天要多上五次，不過英國人倒是彈無虛發。任何德國人不惜犧牲去收聽英國廣播，這可說反納粹運動成熟的現象。不問罰則如何嚴厲——收聽外國廣播者處數年徒刑，再犯者可處以死刑——德國百姓甘之如飴。他們把一架收音機，高聲放送德國廣播，另外一架却隱藏着偷偷的收取外國電台播音。</p>
<p>英國廣播電台，常把德國老百姓不能聽取外國播音一事向德人刺激。「希姆萊（德國政治警察局長）對你們說，聽了外國播音與要妨害神經的。其實，德國人呀，他所怕的不是你們的神經，而是你們的思想呢。你們受欺騙了。我們在英國可以暢聽德國播音，即使警察站在窗外，也不妨事哩。」</p>
<p>英國向德廣播一向實事求是，竭力以正確來博取德人的信仰，常常先開奏幾張德國軍樂中的哀歌唱片，然後朗誦最近俘獲的德國海陸空方面的俘虜名單。這對於聽衆吸引力極大，因爲德國人對於這種消息向不在國內宣佈。東普魯士的一個婦人接得官方通知，說他的兒子因潛水艇出事殉國。定期在鄉村教堂中舉行追悼禮拜。英國的廣播電台却廣播着這孩子的姓名，說他還是生存着。城裹的雜貨商人秘密地把這好消息去告知孩子的母親。這婦人另外的四個朋友也冒着生命的危險來通知這同樣的訊息。追悼禮拜如期舉行，但事後還閉門來了一個歡宴。</p>
<p>關於食物等缺乏的廣播，最爲主婦們傷感。有時候英國播音員來一個「主婦節目」，若無具事的說出一個烹調方法，裹面說的是「四隻雞子，四份之一磅白塔油，和兩大匙糖」德國太太們聽了未免要反躬自問哩。英國人又常常轉播「德國自由」電台的節目，這種電台定設於德國境內，用卡車裝運來往各地。無綫電工程學家說，這種電台的裝置非得有五輛或六輛的卡車不能裝運，大部份這種電台是在法國邊境播音的。不問它所在何處，德國人總認爲這件事頭痛的哩。</p>
<p>法國的對德廣播情形與英國相仿——常把希特勒的演說提出加以註解，在他言而無信的地方，攻擊更力。法國播音員說：「希特勒堅持他要使歐洲免於赤化，現在他却投入史太林的懷抱了。你們且聽他在「我的奮　」第三四六頁中說些什麽。」德國對英的廣播主任爲伊哇灣人嘉爾坦白，一九一八年參與歐戰。四年前赴德，與一德女結婚，就加入了德國的宣傅機關。他的宜傳無非誇耀德國的武力，並要離間英美，不過來勢還不上分兇惡罷了德人對內常把無綫電廣播作爲振奮人心的工具，刺激德人對英憎恨無所不用其極。在德國境內發生了一件意外事情，總得有下面這幾句話：「在塲發現含有英國口音的嫌疑人，警廳現方偵查中。」德國人每天要把返自前綫首的報告，向衆廣播。德國飛機剛從前綫偵察回來，或剛從敵方轟炸飛回，就借重了袖珍顯音機對衆播音。潛艇艦長也把頭伸出了司令塔，叙述敵艦被擊沉的光景。曾經從事於新聞界的德國人，在朴茨登　了特殊訓練，便出來組織德國「宣傳公司」，專鬥從事於上面所說的各種廣播。他們的節目很是充實，德國家庭無不趨之若鶩。</p>
<p>所奇的，就是各國各自宣傳，從事無綫電的播音戰，却沒有一方在空氣中使對方電波受擾，根本上無從廣播。大槪擾亂電波的結果不免仇恨愈深，而雙方都認爲無綫電廣播是攻守咸宜的利器呢。（節譯Readeus　Dilest）</p>

<p>合衆杯慈善籃球、昨爲第二日、兩幕甲二組，始終緊張、上行對中一之戰、最初上行曾居下風、入後始以十四比九領先上半時、復以三十一對二十五秦凱、第二幕西華戰同仁之宜家班、實力稍見懸殊、西華之邱孝慈、與高兆龍、兩人共獲四十一分之多、致同仁始終於被控制之形勢下、以四十對六十三慘敗、前半三十三比十六、亦西華領先、壓軸戰羣毅對滬靑、無一秒鐘不在緊張之中、滬靑於大受威脅之餘、始於最後十分鐘始反敗爲勝、現合衆杯兩組錦標銀杯、已於昨日起陳列於愛多亞路一千號協興運動器具公司營業部、滬靑與羣毅戰情如後、</p>

<p>易籃以後、羣毅聲勢仍振、何孝光聯珠彈發、盡中紅心、于德海與沈聿恭連中兩鵠、仍維持均勢、迨沈聿恭一射、追至三十六與三十七之接近局面、稍停陳學崇因四次犯規罰出、觀衆亦均爲滬靑危、不圖李祖德調登後、卽籃下托中、而爲滬靑造成第三次抬頭機會、但羣毅立卽追成平等、自各三十九以及各四十、雙方均勢未破，惜羣毅長力不繼、滬靑則愈戰愈勇、大貓與于德海、一氣連增九分、遂使滬靑脫離險境、成四十八比四十、最後七分鐘、陶紹生四决犯規出塲、更使羣毅受一更大打擊、滬靑終以五十六對四十八反敗爲勝、</p>

<h3>兩法租界今日起加捐　滬市生活愈困難　勢將牽動物價及房租價　法租界納稅會再請考慮</h3>
<p>公共租借工部局增捐百分之五十、即房捐·地稅·執照費及其他一切應繳之費、均另加附加費百分之五十、法租界公董局加捐、計地捐附加稅、由千分之一增為千分之三、房捐附加稅、由百分之二增為百分之七、其他照會稅及雜稅之附加稅、均由百分之十增為百分之五十、兩租界上項加捐、均如期於今日起實行、兩租界納稅人負担、行見愈益增加、共可能的後果、勢將刺激物價、助長增租糾紛、</p>
<p>函請法當局再考慮</p>
<p>法租界納稅華人會、對加捐事、以公董局覆函、竟拒絕所請、昨特再函公董局據理力爭、請該局督辦白未地埃姆·總辦特吉底而·重加致慮、原函云、「敬啟者、接奉六月二十八日大函、敬悉種切、關於此次即將附之實行之加捐比率、敝會早已深切研討、並無加捐百分之四十之說、祗謂各項捐稅、其增加比率、最高者竟達百分之四十、如車輛執照然、此點敝會極需剴切剖明者也、查一九三七年戰事爆發後、法租界居民突形增加、</p>
<p>市容繁興</p>
<p>貴局各項支出驚務費用等、雖形增加、然往日無人租賃之空屋、乃得一掃而空、且空地建屋、風起雲湧、房捐之收入、亦隨之增加、故貴局之支出雖增、而收入亦同樣增加也、惟試請考查一九三九年後、法租界居民人數、顯有逐漸減少之象、其原因不外物價高漲、生活困難、而間接原因、則貴局之鉅額捐稅亦有</p>
<p>相當關係</p>
<p>蓋戰後各項捐稅之附加稅、為數頗鉅也、夫任何一區域之興衰、固以居民之增減爲準繩、倘貴局擬維持目前之繁興、自不宜使居民減少、則捐稅之增加、殊堪予以嚴重之打擊也、至於貴局之經濟基礎、</p>
<p>向稱穩固</p>
<p>考之經濟原則量入為出、收支相抵、故每屆財政預算、固屬需要、惟敢請貴局無需斤斤於斯、蓋按照歷届決算、年有盈餘、此盈餘亦堪補不足也、況最近法租界難民區域警務撤回、於支出上當可節減不少、總之、民為重、社稷次之、整個區域之盛衰、悉緊於民生之安危、皆操於此區域之行政者乎、相因相生相需相賴、是以此次加捐問題、擬請貴局再加考慮、能得中止實行、或減少增加比率、或緩期施行、我法租界鉅萬居民、實所悚惶企翹之至、用特函達、請煩查照見復爲荷、此致法租界公董局、」</p>

<h3>越南扣陰丹士林布　諮詢原委　重慶法大使館　已有電令到滬</h3>
<p>自越南政府實行扣留本埠各廠商運往內地經由該處轉口之國產陰丹士林布疋後、本埠市商曾以該陰丹士林商標、雖係德國註冊、惟布疋之原料、純係國產之自紡自織自染、今突被扣留、顯係誤會所致、特電經濟部轉請外交部向駐華法大使館提出交涉、並解釋一切、本埠方面、則函請法駐滬總領事根據越南政府、將被扣布疋、迅即放行、維緊固有之敦睦邦交、而利商運、聞重慶法大使館、已有電令到滬、囑領署召集有關方面、從事諮詢、以便相機辦理、本埠法總領署自接獲此項電令後、已正式函知市商會、轉令該業同業公會、囑被扣留會員廠商、迅即推派代表、會同商會代表前往領署、聽候諮詢、聞各代表已由該業推定、</p>
<h3>文卷移交於法無據　華方嚴重交涉　交還中國政府方爲合法　英美兩當局應審慎考慮</h3>
<p>前上海市政府寄存於工部局之土地局交卷自經偽「市府」方面迭向工部局提出要求後、該問題由工部局及領事團互相考慮、茲據平明社記者向公共租借當局方面探悉、領團方面少數意見、對於該項寄存文卷、似有尤許偽方要求之意向、惟華方則一致反對、幷已向英美兩當局提出交涉、促其注意、本案之法律據點、蓋以偽組織未經任何一國所承認、是不能貿然移交、且此項文卷、爲中政府所託為保管、殊應待諸異日、交還中國政府、方爲合法、現正由英美兩當局重爲審慎考慮、</p>
<p>嚴重背信不啻投降</p>
<p>宇林西報昨載讀者孫君來函稱、貴報頃載社評、題曰、「一個重要問題、」內主張將愈市長鴻鈞前寄存工部局之華方土地局卷宗移交傅筱庵、閱讀之餘、</p>
<p>殊深震驚</p>
<p>評內有言曰、「已往一年又三季來、情況好轉之程度、已臻無處駁斥而可安然謂局勢已恢復合理的預料中之常態矣、」抑其他中外人士是否抱此見解、殊可疑也、查工部局代表中國政府而接受卷宗、</p>
<p>妥為保管</p>
<p>茍以此卷宗、交予合法的中政府以外任何方面、實屬嚴重的背信之舉、英國民衆對於英同盟國之投降、而必使英國利益大受影響、嚴加抨擊、工部局茍尤以卷宗交予傅筱庵、不啻　　小規模的投降、然其卑鄙、則與降服、初無二致也、此時希望其英國友人已得妥協無濟於事之痛苦教訓者、固不僅中國民衆而已也、</p>
<h3>華流動部隊　已抵崑山　前午一時許　京滬路中斷</h3>
<p>禰來華方流動部隊、在沿京滬路綫又極活躍、最近數日前、除襲擊丹陽車站、並炸毀日軍用車一列外、茲又據昨晨到滬之京滬路旅客稱、前（二十九日）午一時許、在無錫附近之京滬路鐵路路軌、又被華方流動部隊掘去多段、以致京滬路交通、又一度中斷、惟詳情因旅客不便探問、故無從知悉、嗣經日方修理後、始得通行、並悉華方流動部隊、頃已陸續向滬郊伸展、其先頭部隊、聞已越過青陽港而到達崑山一帶、</p>
<h3>南市難區結束　印象深刻</h3>
<p>南市難民區遣散手續、業告終了、區內一萬九千人之遣散恩糧、已於昨日發放完畢、該區監察委員會總辦事處、亦隨區務結束而宣告撤銷、除區內尚有醫院兩所及新普育堂、由善後委員會暫維現狀外、所有八十八處收容所、均於昨日宣告結束、按區內難民、平日由區辦事處計口授糧、每名每日發米半磅、因多數從事小販作工等營生、尚能勉以渡日、今驟失賑糧接濟、來日大難、同時居處亦發生問題、因收容所房屋之爲私人產業者、將藉口難區結束而予收回也、南市難民區成立於八一三事變上海戰事最緊張之時、其時滬郊戰區、流亡載道、設無該區設置、生靈塗炭、自更慘重、該區正式成立日期、爲民國二十六年十一月十一日、至昨日（六月三十日）因　神父離滬而宣告結束、共歷時兩年七個月又十九日、予人之印象甚深、</p>
<h3>法僑接標語信函　悲憤填膺　舊游已成陳跡　何從消愁解悶</h3>
<p>法文上海日報云、本埠法僑、於前日收到法國五月底之來信、在其信封上、類皆蓋有標語宜傳之印戳、其中有謂「勝利尚在長期忍耐之後」、「某城（現已淪陷）之古屋及博物院值得參觀」等標語、法僑接信之下、撫今追昔、莫不悲憤填膺、蓋以事過境遷、曾幾何時、已成陳跡、尤令人低徊不置也、依法文報之意、現在本埠法僑、惟有努力工作、以振民氣、則以工作雖不足以忘憂、但亦可使緊張之神經、稍為鬆弛、而使已碎之心、有所依傍、不至傷神也、該報以為任何之工作、均當對於公衆有利、而在本身亦得安慰、</p>
<h3>米糧業會議結束　組評價委會</h3>
<p>上海市豆米行業同業公會、日昨會同雜糧油餅業公會協商、穩定米市具體辦法、經討論結果、秉承當局意旨、組織上海米業團體糧食評價委員會、以期專責辦理米價評定事宜、茲該會已推定委員會朱尤長·曹莘耕·嚴筱泉定於今日上午十時再度晋謁當局、報告同業集議經過、及目前組織糧食評價委員會之需要、如徵得當局同意、即着手辦理、預料當局或將促其實現、香港當局爲疏散人口、已禁止船隻出口、並未禁止米糧出口、故已裝米船隻、日內或可啟椗來滬、又悉日前自港裝米一千六百噸、本擬運滬應市、惟於中途、臨時決定、轉運寗波、七月初間即有大量抵埠、數達十三萬餘包、</p>

<p>昨日（六月卅日）爲馮炳南先生紀念母壽舉行五教演講之第二日、所講爲耶教之要旨三部曲、主講者爲有名之基督教學者徐松石先生、是日聽講者、仍極踴躍、基督教徒與非基督教徒均有之、徐先生對於基督教義、認識甚深、闡發至爲明白、關於教義與孝道聯成關係、極具卓見、於孔子思想舉說、亦引證頗多、足見宗教旨歸、原為一致、至謂基督教重任在實行、而不重理論、尤能摘發出該教立教精神之所在、而發人深省、結段所述糊塗蟲之笑話、令聽者哄堂、故聽衆始終精神飽滿、是日播音簡經裝置改善、故發音較第一日更爲清晰異常、場中增裝風扇數架、故涼風習習、今日爲演講之第三日、所講爲道教之要旨與道德、關於道教之公開演講、向極少有、預料戰衆必更形踴躍、在場並分贈德育古鑑一書、及道教入門贈書券、但為名貴之作物、</p>
<h3>猶太人在上海</h3>
<p>— 阿泉</p>
<p>如果我們偶爾踏進蘇州河以北，沿着北四川路橫浜橋轉折至匯山捕房舟山路百老匯路一帶……作一次環廻式的巡禮，至少，會給我們發現到許許多多亡命似的羔羊－底猶太人。</p>
<p>自從前歲德國下令排猶，猶太人便頓時變成「虎口殘餘底亡命者」；使他們深深地感到偌大的地球，早已沒有亡國者的立足地了！唉！試問破毀了牢穴的羔羊，徬徨滿目中，還有那一條路好走呢？終於遁不了屠夫血手的驅逐，他們遂被逼到這個天涯海角一生夢想不到的上海來。</p>
<p>猶太人在上海，可說虹口一帶是他們這一羣羔羊的唯一牢穴吧？所有那兒一帶任何戰後空遺着的房屋，沒有一間不給他們住滿了！</p>
<p>猶太人是素來以「經商獨特」聞於世的。講到謀逐什一之利得手腕，尤其「尖銳化」。因此，乃有人以「算盤精」或「落地水銀」來形容他們「經商才幹」；蓋言其「有隙則乘」，「無孔弗人」；此言很覺微妙！猶太人自從來上海不久，－還在虹口尚未開放以前－許許多多的猶太人，老早已經成羣聚族地在虹口一帶發展他們「單獨」或「集團」的經濟網式的林立般商店了。甚麼咖啡室咧，百貨商店咧，小型跳舞場咧，電影院咧，理髮室咧，報關行咧，甚至連猶太堂子……都在開得節比鱗次了！「猶太人是狡猾的狐狸，」又有人這般地說：「他們不論在任何事物上常常會乘着可取的小小機會，很輕便地佔人家的便宜；比仿你偶然向一個猶太人借一枝火柴點香烟，他也會向你討回一枝香烟來做火柴的代價。」</p>
<p>猶太人做生意，不獨單純地以門市招徠就認為滿足的；他們還要親自出馬帶了許多日常用品到附近一帶洋行的辦事地方，實行「兜攬」主義，說得玄妙一點，連理髮匠也有人登門求教哩！</p>
<p>猶太人在上海，生活在片面上還似乎過得去：但是他們內心的憂患和精神上的痛苦，我以為忒其可憐的吧！不信，且讓筆者舉兩個例來：</p>
<p>這雖然是去年的事情了，但至今仍舊深深地遺留在我的心頭。有一次：當×國郵輪抵上海－那時正是猶太人放逐到上海的時期－有着盈千累萬的猶太難民被儎到這個孤島來，扶老携幼，紊亂非常；教人看到了這一幅「羔羊流浪圖」不期然地就教你感到「國破家亡」的痛苦。一個猶太人偶然到我的公司寫字　借用電話，他打着不甚純粹的英語向我說道：「先生！不很有趣麼？這便是我很僥倖從德國帶來的全副家産了！」他說時，用手指着一個小小的手提皮夾帶着慘苦的微笑。他沒有哭，這大約他還算是個哲人？珍惜着不易流的眼淚，備以應付未來生命綫上更痛苦的環境吧！</p>
<p>又有一次：×國郵輪在大雨滂沱中，又儎來了第二批可憐的亡命者。（當然是猶太難民）但是，在碼頭的鐵柵外，又有許許多多的猶太人，被×國關員檳棄在門外，一個也不許跑進去，雖然他們都有着充分的理由；只許他們望洋興嘆，在大雨傾盆中做落湯雞而已　倒是非常湊巧，一雙洋狗反沒有被關員攔阻，得以揚長越進鐵柵內。我目擊了這一幕不覺爲感情驅動，發生了一種傷感：「唉！亡了國的痛苦，真是一條狗都不如！」</p>

<h3>香港緊張　華人紛紛離境　分往西南及馬尼刺等地　由港開滬各輪搭客滿傤</h3>
<p>香港自受威脅宣佈戒嚴後、情勢至為緊張、當地政府、巳下令撤退英國婦孺僑民、並限於木月五日前完成、一面召集華僑領袖、籌劃撤退、昨據航業界接獲香港電告、旅港華人、因鑒局勢之緊張、咸感不安、連日亦紛紛遷移離港、目前由港開滬各輪、船票巳爭購一空、然大多數則乘港越問交通未斷絕前、携眷撤退、離港赴西南各省、目前港越航輪、除正班兼灣各輪外、並有廣東海檀兩輪、專程往返、滇越鐵路雖未中斷、第因越南及香港兩地華人之撤退、與壅積貨物之趕運、車輛往返、已呈呆滯、又悉美國總統郵船公司之柯立芝總統號、於上週由滬返港後、卽被調載運外僑婦孺赴馬尼刺、故原定本月九日返滬、勢將延躭數日、</p>
<p>荷印　防務</p>
<p>荷印防務、現亦巳臻週密、目前共有步兵四圑，及二獨立營、並有坦克車隊、海防隊及高射砲隊、海軍數額計有輕巡洋艦兩艘、驅逐艦八艘、潛水艇十二艘、砲艦二艘、水雷敷設艦五艘、水雷掃除艦八艘、此外並在西星伯島安巴拿港（Amboyna）設有海軍飛機根據地、故實力極為雄厚、</p>
<p>英人　評論</p>
<p>本埠著名英籍評論家伍德海氏、在昨日英文大美晚報星期周刊發表一文、對於目前英日關係緊張有所評述、該文首稱、吾儕可以推定英政府當局警告港地婦孺準備撤退、顯係因日本軍隊最近採取敵對行動之故、日本軍隊自登陸九龍附近後、已完成包圍九龍邊境、對港實施封鎖、此項行動、企圖脅迫英政府停止利用香港及緬甸公路運輸「軍火材料」入中國內地、在</p>
<p>法理上言日政府實無樣提此要求、據日方自稱、「彼與中國國民政府並非在交戰狀態中」、則日本要求享受交戰國權利、純屬越權、日方固能以强力禁止貨物由佔領區運入內地、但彼毫無理由、可以要求干涉香港之貿易及滇緬路之運輸、港政府已正式否認軍火由港運入內地、香港純為分配中心、在法律上道德上、</p>
<p>無權阻止一切中立國貨物運華、苟英政府禁止美國貨車或汽油經港運華、則美當局當遷怒於英、自是意中事、至於滇緬公路、每月所能運入雲南者僅數百噸、該路是吾勝任運輸大砲坦克車及飛機發動機、尚屬疑問、同時該路實則僅任輸出之功用、英美兩國需用中國內地</p>
<p>各種士產故各種土產、雖支付萬款運費、亦不得已賴該路之運輸能力以獲得之、該文末謂港當局通知婦孺撤退、顯示英政府不願接受日軍金部要求、目前美國是吾予英以積極及道德之支持、尚須揣測、但無論如何、美國認為英如聽任該路被封鎖、則不營出賣中國政府、伍氏希望英日當局、不至因此問題而趨決裂、苟日方完全一味固執、則決裂或恐不免也、</p>
<p>港地　謠熾</p>

<p>鄙人不敢自承為能盡孝，但是深知道孝道為做人之本，未敢稍有疏忽。現値家母的七秩壽辰，不願以世俗豪奢的過眼雲烟方式，來舉行慶祝，而想用一個較有持久性的，對於人們的心靈和肉體，都有裨益的辦法，以為紀念。鄙人以為一個人的心靈與肉體，有同樣的重要，肉體固然當求其健全，而心靈上的健全，亦應該一樣加以注意。肉體的健全，可以靠科學而獲得，但是心靈上的健全，則不是科學所能為力。就是肉體的健全，有時亦不能乞靈於科學，所以人體的疾病，除了科學的治療以外，尚有許多要用精神來療治。世人只見科學的有形的煊赫的效果，有可以按索的準確跡象，便以為科學萬能，科學雖然有它的能力，然而不是萬能的。世人往往以為科學能創造，其實科學並無創造的能力，只是把已有的事物，加以說明，加以配合，或加以改良而已，斷斷談不上創造。嚴格的來說，人類是沒有創造的能力的，例如無綫電，能够超越千萬里的空間而傳聲，人們或者以為道是人類創造的功績，其實亦只是利用宇宙間原有的「以太」的作用，加以若干原有的物質上的配合而已。如果科學單獨發展，而沒有道德隨着它齊驅並進，則科學不但不能有益於人類，反而會有害於人類。我們但看兩决的歐洲大戰，便可見沒有道德相輔而行的科學，是會產生怎樣的效果了，所以道德與科學，應該交相為用，不可有所偏缺。科學是探求事物的眞理的方法，而道德則是探求做人的眞理的方法，做人的眞理，未曾獲得，則事物的眞理，何補於我們？道德與科學，能够合作，則人類日進於文明，若道德與科學分離，則不論科學進步，達到如何完善的程度，紙足以加速人類的退化而已。世界上沒有科學，人類還可以生存，如果沒有了道德，便不能生存了。現代的人，對於科學，推崇備至，在科學落後的我國，原也難怪，但是對於道德問題，似乎太忽略了。道德對於人類，旣是這般重要，則我們亟應積極提倡，萬不可任其墮落，故以為要改良社會，第一件要做的事，就是要將道德的條件，用最簡明的方法，使人人可知，人人可行的表彰出來。使人人的行為，都有所依歸，有所矜式。亦有人謂，現在世界尚强權，而子尙講道德，豈非不合時宜？我意不然，因為世界越不講道德越野蠻，我們越應當講道德，不能因為有多少人的不願聽，便不加以提倡。同時並應想出種種方法來，感化得大家願聽。我曾細想，世界上做人的態度，不外五種，（）一利人利己，（二）利人不損己，（三）利人損己，（四）損人利己，（五）損人不利己。第一種最合理，第二種亦可以行得，第三種不是普通人人人所能做的，第四種就要不得，第五種更要不得。所謂簡明的道德標準及方法，就是要教人如何可以做得到上面所說的最合理的態度，就是如何可以利人利己。</p>
<p>此次紀念家母壽辰，為求其較有意義，為求其較可以有益於社會人羣起見，舉辦下列的三件事。</p>
<p>第一件事，先請名儒碩學，將五教的要義，摘其與做人的道德有關係的，作概括簡易的演講。一方面延聘通才，編撰儒釋道耶回五教入鬥，鄙人鑒於一切科學，都能標準化，都有定律，有一定的程式，有事物的論據，而道德方面，則向來沒有這樣具體。在理論和方法方面，一向都是雜亂而無標準的，而且往往聚訟紛紜，莫衷一是，就是有志於道德上的依歸者，見效亦異常遲緩，不若科學之奏效速而功易見。因此，便覺得道德方面也有確定準程，教人入手的必要。儒釋道耶回五教崇奉的對象，雖有不同，採用的儀式，雖然各異，但其宗旨，總無非是勸人去惡修善，如果人人能了解宗教的眞義，人人能奉行宗教的眞旨，則全世界不難臻於至善。不過五教的學說，意義精深，未必人人都能懂得其奧妙，，然而其中亦有不少易於懂得易於實踐的，這就可以作爲做人的道德的入門方法，這部　，着手編纂，巳歷相當時日，每教各為一書，不久當可印行問</p>
<p>第二件事，就是翻繹英國大儒斯邁爾的自助論，人格論，職責論，節的論，人生與工作，五部名作，以補五教入鬥之不足。這幾部書，對於修身立業，處世做人的道理，闡發得很明白，而且所舉實例很多，最易發人深省。歐洲有了這麽幾部不朽的佳作，可以益世利人，可惜他們不會去研究，去利用，只知道注重物質的科學，以致造成一决二决的空前的浩刦，是多麽痛心的一件事！鄙人生平，對於這幾部書，服膺最篤，獲益最多，所以特地將他們來介紹給社會凡五教入門所未及道者，可以在這幾部書中求职，現在已經着手翻譯，不過工作是非常繁瑣的，希望在一二年內，可以完成。</p>

<h3>遺產稅開征之檢討</h3>
<p>— 草火</p>
<p>籌畫征稅之經過</p>
<p>喧傳巳久的遺產稅，從今天起，終於全國一體施行了。</p>
<p>遺產是百分之百的不勞而獲；約翰米爾說：「沒有人應當享受比他的相當獨立生活所需要的財富還多的遺產」理應課以重稅。英國早在一六九四年卽行開征；我國在民初也有征收之議，然而多年來，擬草案，定原則，還是「只聞扶梯響，不見人下來。」民十七年算是下決心了，五月國民政府有舉辦遺產稅以發展教育事業之宣言，同年七月全國財政會議又有舉辦所得及遺產二項租稅以充作敎育事業之專稅的議案。十八年更制定遺產稅條例及施行細則，木可按部推行，不料當時重金騁來改革財政的甘末爾委員會各洋專家認為我國習慣，富家子女，多仰賴遺產過活，若征收遺產稅，恐予中國以鉅大之不利（見該委員會稅制報告書），洋財政專家這樣看重我國大家庭制度，原是和洋教育專家勸我們讀論語孟子那樣尊敬我國舊道德同等一片婆心好意；結果，遺產稅底施行便又擱起不提。</p>
<p>之後，到二十五年，在孔財長增稅以平衡財政收支政策下，政府又重下實行決心；於是，原則，草案，多方修改，二十七年九月通過遺產稅暫行條例，二十八年十二月三十日頒布遺產稅暫行條例施行細則。現在正式開征了，我國財政在直接稅途上更跨前一大步，實在是抗戰建國期中又可慶幸之一事。</p>
<p>就公佈之暫行條例而論，縝密周詳，相當令人滿意。</p>
<p>首先，我們得指出：本條例採用總遺產制，實為其最大優點。總遺產稅（又名遺產稅）與分遺產稅（又名繼承稅）不同；前者就遺產總額課稅，後者就每一繼承人或受益人所分得的遺產，依其親等遠近，分別課稅。二者優劣，一般說素以為：總遺產稅計算者，收人多；但不計親等，則近親遠親，倖得機會不同，却受課以同一稅率，實為不公平；反之，分遺產稅就親等遠近課稅，固得公平，惟計算繁，並因免稅額不止一度，收入遂少。據說，立法院曾因草案採總遺產制，委員頗多異議，蓋由於認總遺產制不公，持上述見解也。其實，分遺產制分別親等遠近，是鼓勵遺產傳與近親，因而財產益集中在一二人手上（有錢人子女籍其父之地位。金錢。勢力，大概在其父去世前，也己發了不大不小的財吧）公平乎哉？且所謂遠親，在習慣傳統上遺產傳與最親之繼承人的我中國，而能獲得遺產之分給，則其對於被繼承人生前定有莫大功勞可知，較之最親之子女，悻得機會為大之說，實不知何所據而言。因此，我認爲總遺產制較分遺產制更為公平，加以手續簡，收入多，正適合此時此地之需要。我國遺產稅「爲中央稅，但中央應以其純收入，按下列標準分給省市縣：（一）省百分之十五，（二）市縣百分之二十五。省市縣應以前項純收入百分之四十充教育經費。」見二十四年公佈財政收支系統法第五條）地方政府得此分潤亦可彌補廢除苛雜所失，而其用途主要限於發展教育事業，在教育日臻重要而經費却日趨艱困拮据的今天，也是頗値得稱讚的。</p>
<p>遺產稅課稅範圍的規定原有二說：屬地主義與屬人主義。前者是：凡人於死亡時在本國遺有財產，均經課稅，不問其國籍為何，是否本國人民；後者是：凡本國人民，其遺產，不淪所在何地，他國抑本國，均須課稅。我國兼採之（見暫行條例第一條），因為單屬地主義易誘資本逃避國外，單屬人主義稅收又將不豐；二者並用，實出之考慮周詳。</p>
<p>「本條例所稱遺產為被繼承人之動產不動產及其他一切有財產價値之權利」（暫行條例第二條）是遺產之含義，採正統學說，以死亡與財產為遺產搆成要素。但有人認謂：「遺物之拾得，埋藏物之發見，其遺物者與埋物者，經過一定之公告手續後，仍不認領其所有物，便證明其無取回財產之可能，其財產便含有遺產之意味」，而且「遺產稅為限制人民偶然之悻得而設，拾遺者發埋者之倖運原不亞於領受遺產之人」因而主張將遺產擴張解釋，把拾遺與埋藏物之稅併入計算，並提議以「其領受人不能證明原所有人為生存時，推定其為繼承開始」依條例課稅。這意見有相當理由，我認為財政當局，今後仍不妨加以考慮。</p>
<p>遺產之評價，各國均採用市價為標準。我國亦然，（見暫行條例第五條），但一般財產依市價估定固為公平，土地房屋等不動產却不然，尤其是土地不易變現，幸施行條例有第十二條「土地房屋等不動產之評價，如不能依繼承開始時之市價評定時，但就其租金依週息百分之十二還原計算其價額」之規定，且另訂有優待辦法以資救濟，暫行條例第九條有自耕土地半價課稅之規則。當然這還有鼓勵自耕的意義，年來農村痛苦，蘇民困以復興農村，此規定實不可缺。同樣第十條規定「依法不得採伐或一未達採伐年齡之樹木應先扣除」，藉以提倡造林。凡此，皆我遺產稅優特處。</p>
<p>然而筆者對於暫行條例，尚有數點意見：</p>
<p>一，未成年之繼承人，應訂一定數額之教育基金；喪葬費用亦宜定一最高額，連同被繼承人最後病費三者應在計算被繼承人遺產總額時先扣除；這點可補列暫行條例第十條中。</p>
<p>二，第七條「（二）陸海空軍官佐士兵及公務員或戰時陣亡：或因戰地服務受傷致死者之一遺產」宜改為「陸……致死者其遺產總額未滿××元者」免稅額，宜有一定。因事實上我國軍人公務員多擁巨資，裹屍沙塲，雖曰為國，究不必如是過份優待也。</p>
<p>三，第七條（五）捐贈教育文化或慈善公益事業之財產未超過五十萬元者免稅。這也是値得重行考慮的。為政府貫澈其發展教育文化的一施行遺產稅最初動機計，為鼓勵國民捐慈善公益事業，消泯單顧一己家族舊觀念計，捐助部份應一律免稅才是。</p>
<p>四，第八條「已納遺產稅之遺產於三年內再有繼承開始情事者，其已納稅之遺價額免再征稅」：這政府太過「顧慮」民情了。我是贊成意人呂那拿Engenis　Rignano底主張的。他的主張（或辦法）是這樣：死亡者遺產之長一靠自己勤儉所得來的部份，課以普通稅率；其直接從共父親或他人繼承來的財產，課以百分一之五十稅率；其間接由其父或他人繼承下來的財產，課以百分之百分稅率。只有這樣辦法才能澈底限制人民偶然之倖得；只有這樣才能鼓勵人民勤儉心儲蓄心；才能增加收入（本年全國預算數僅列二百萬元）適應目前抗戰建國之需要；才能節制資本，完成民生主義之理想。假定如是辦理，則須依呂那拿辦法，於財產繼承開始時或最好於此種稅制公佈後調查人民財產時，把人民財產分為二部（一）二分之一或三分之二算作本人勤儉所得，（二）二分之一或三分之一算作已經經過一决轉移的遺產。</p>
<p>對於遺產稅制度本身，所要說的，大概不外乎此了。</p>
<h3>財產調查問題</h3>
<p>然而遺產稅之成功與否，半決於稅制本身良吾，半決於實施後有無困難，能吾防止逃稅。這裏就牽涉到財產調查一問題了。逃避，藏匿，私贈各式種樣方法，大概不可免的。在這裹，我們得記着中國今日的抗戰是全民的抗戰，祖宗光榮，子孫幸福，均繫於此。有錢出錢，有力出力」，天地良心。當大多數民衆與槍彈肉搏洒其熱血於前綫時，不勞而獲的偶然倖得實不容逃稅；實不能且不應姑息憐恕的。那末，有什麼方法以度過這財產調查難關呢？有！有民衆在；把民衆動員起來，組織起來，讓他們舉發，則輕而易舉，且確實可靠狐狸般狡猾的地主豪紳還是不能逃過多數貧苦民衆的耳目。參政會四屆大會閉會詞中說：「中國欲貫澈其絕對必要之作戰目的，更須動員全民，加强長期抗戰之一切設施」。至於戶名，堂名，別字，號等的須一律廢除，每人限用一名，更應馬上實行，已不必多說了。</p>

<p>（二）以前上海金價上落，根據英倫現金爲轉移，自一九三一年英停止金本位後，始改　美現金　套美　水而定漲落，然有時因供求之多寡及時局之變化，亦足以影響市價之漲落，（例如美金每　斯價為35元美金，則美元一元價為法幣十六元（合匯水517／32，而每盎斯重量，合前開平848495，現市兩　以8525成之，即得上海之金價。</p>
<p>（三）以港幣或越幣在香港或海防購買美金，因各該地政府限制，須經正當手續，向銀行申請，而上海黑市買賣不受限制，隨時可以交易，較為便利。</p>
<p>程濟義君來問</p>
<p>（一）歐戰後，英國統制匯兌，我國未列入英鎊集團，何以在申可以售出英鎊？雖云投機買空賣空，究必根據尋實，設甲商售出　匯一萬　與乙商，乙商如實際需要一英匯，理論上勢必向甲取得向設在英國境內之甲商辦事處或代理人取款之憑證或匯一票，以便提取英鎊；是與　英匯申無異，統制豈不失其效力？英政府豈能硯若無覩？（二）又如甲所有之芙匯在利物浦或香港，乙則需在倫敦取款，欲完成此筆交易，仍必須假手銀行；銀行豈肯干觸法令，為彼等効勞？又如甲有款存在倫敦銀行，勢必將存單交付乙，待乙將存單寄至倫敦提得款後，交易方能結淸；若果如是，需時甚久，手續亦繁，何以上海市塲買賣外匯甚為便捷？當天可以交割？</p>
<p>（三）如甲乙二商互不相識，而買賣金額甚鉅，經紀人是否擔保甲商於取得乙商之國幣後，在英交英鎊與乙商？與有無擔保能力？</p>
<p>（四）前據報載：香港限制鈔票出口與非英鎊集團外滙；但據大公報匯兌商情攔所載，每日港銀行買賣申滙，一如往昔，且數額恒在數萬數十萬以上；然個人託銀行兌款，則有種種限制；究莧此中實情如何？</p>
<p>（五）巿塲習聞某處英匯或美匯與某商，此英美匯諒必係不記名匯票，只記金額及取款銀行地點；在有外匯市塲之大都市一均可持以買賣者，未知是否？</p>
<p>（六）甲商需在香港交美匯與乙商，未知可吾在上海買進美匯或香港交付之美匯？然後持此憑單寄至香港，交與乙商？或轉售內商？</p>
<h3>—葉淸江先生答—</h3>
<p>關於「英國統制匯兌，我國未列入英磅集團何以在申可售出英磅一節」，因為付款係在倫敦，不違統制條例；故在申可售出英磅。例如甲方售於乙方英磅一萬，則甲方須開具英國代理銀行之一萬英磅支票與乙方，乙方可憑票向英國代理行家支現；而乙方所得者為英磅一萬磅，仍以一萬磅在英國境內使用，不得換美金票或其他外幣；英國資金仍未流出國外，故不在統制範圍之內。</p>
<p>銀行對於有正當用途之商人，為需用英磅，仍可申請；不受統制。故如甲所有之英匯在利物浦或香港，如經過正當手續，即甲開與乙之英磅支票，可向英國境內任何銀行代辦一切手續；干法令。至於「甲有款存在倫敦銀行……上海買賣英匯當天何以可交割？」即係屬電滙。賣出或買進全以報通電；知如以匯票交易，須經銀行手續方能兌現；手續自較麻煩。</p>
<p>除存款外，尚有我國輸出之農產物：如桐油豬鬚茶葉等及輕工業製造品運往國外，均可換取金磅；暫存英國倫敦之銀行，待善瀆而沽之。又國外華僑　款祖國，為數亦甚鉅。海外華僑往往　此間各銀行代售英磅作抵。</p>
<p>經紀人對於代理買賣　項，只能担保當天或限於在申交割；能担保在英交付英磅與否。唯事實上，買賣金磅匯票，如經可靠銀行之正當手被，可無問題。</p>
<p>香港政府雖下令禁止港銀出口；但事實上如有正當用途，而需用港鈔，仍可向香港政府特准買賣之官商銀行申請。如屬投機性質之賣買，絕對禁止。</p>
<p>本埠市塲上不記名即（Bearer）之英美匯票，均可轉購買賣。</p>
<p>如甲商需在香港交付美匯若干與乙商，可在申買進美匯或香港交付之美磁，乙商可持憑票在香港兌取美匯。如係Beare之匯票，亦可轉售與丙商。張事文君問題三則，茲簡答如次：</p>
<p>（一）報載美金價，係美金五元之硬幣的所含純金之價格；美票價，係美金一元之紙幣的滙兌。故兩者價格相差極大。英金英緊等亦然。</p>
<p>美金五元之硬幣，含純金〇·二四〇一七六市秤兩，乘以烚赤價，即得美金硬幣之市價。</p>
<p>美金五元硬幣</p>
<p>英金一鎊之硬幣，含純金〇·二三三八二市秤兩，乘以烚赤價即得，算式如上。</p>
<p>（二）關於各國硬幣重量及成色等，參看本刊三〇一期。</p>
<p>（三）Soverein係英國幣制中按鎊計算的硬幣名稱，有五鎊，二鎊，一鎊，半鎊之別。Sterling作標準的一英鎊解。</p>

<p>德國國內所用之封鎖馬克，在本國價値高，在國外並無市面，故價値極低。惟原則上自由馬克（即所TT馬克）之國外購買力，應與封鎖馬克之在德購買力等價。惟封鎖馬克之發生購買力，限於德國國內，故在國外雖可　自山馬克之滙率代表封鎖馬克之價値，應扣除其運送各費，因此而一發生之貼水。此項貼水，除包刮運送各費在內，又受市塲上之供需影響，故極大，尤其在戰時今日，德滙只有市塲價，運送又極不易。貼水多寡，更不易計算。因之封鎖馬克之國外價値，當然更不能與自由馬克並論。</p>
<p>在德尊友代閣　購書時以封鎖馬克支付，閣　擬以法幣償付其在滬之親族，致發生計價之困難。承垂詢本刊。依記者愚見，欲使變方不吃虧，莫如參照在滬德貨之定價方法計算，較便利。未知尊意以為如何李光周君問題二則，茲簡答如次：</p>
<p>（一）一十七年三月初，我國實施外滙申核制度，將外滙供給之權集中於中央銀行後，非法之徒，利用租界特殊情形，依然在中央銀行外自由　買外滙，於是購成此種外滙黑市塲。故進出黑市塲者，應受法律制裁</p>

<h3>上週外滙起伏之因素</h3>
<p>據上海經濟咨詢所報告，本週外匯市况，尚稱平靜，最高美匯六元三一二五，最低五元九三七五，英匯最高三便士九六八七五，最低三便士七五，考起伏因素，據市塲所傳，的有下列數端。</p>
<p>一·越南緊張　二·美艦隊出動　三·期近月底四·英美滙放長　五·物價低落</p>
<p>按週初以越南情勢緊張，香港邊境不穩，以及本地徐家匯被佔，原足使市面看緊，但成交數量極少，人心多存觀望，而美金對消息之感應反較匯票為敏捷，蓋由花旗票便於零星買賣，兩週來鑒於滙市平靜，大戶尚乏興趣，散戶則靜極思動，惟氣勢不堅，稍遇刺激，卽震盪不定，美艦隊出動，如旨在遠東，對匯市似有良好之影響，如為聲援英國，外幣疑雲愈厚，則匯市亦可看長，但國際局勢變化多端，見仁見智，胥視今後之發展而定，期近月底，兼以三日假期關係，經營者免担風險，殊少交易，况歐戰擴大以後，外國銀行如華義中法東方華比荷蘭等五家，滙市中己少與往來，今祇大通花旗有利三行較為活躍，華商銀行亦若隱若現，以致目前檯面枯竭，縱有買賣，亦少對手，英美匯率週五漲達四元〇一分，殆為英國加緊管理所致，內容究屬如何，目前尚無端倪，故對其解釋，言人人殊，有謂美國將以財力協助英國，有謂歐洲或將和平，惟滬市傳統觀念，多以法幣與金鎊連繫較切，故美匯做大，匯市便有看鬆之勢，物價低落，本足反映法幣之購買力提高，然目下生活指數未見更動，暴漲暴落，僅為投機之對象，過去滬人對法幣之信念，有時未免認識不淸，非爭購外匯，卽力事囤積，歐戰暴發，此夙尤熾，匯票與囤積因果相循，致呈空前之漲風，詎曾幾何時，物價竟告慘落，而匯價亦同時趨鬆，嚴顯著者，如外股棉紗等多跌至一二倍以上，顧因物價過跌，足以减少進口，致匯票需要無多，卽有外匯者亦擬脫手，以便轉購旣跌價之貨物，滙巿之供給於是增多，利用此種心理者，　乘機拋空，予市塲以相當之壓力，而一般浮多頗感恐慌，初則猶豫觀望，繼卽忍痛了結，致有今日之局面，比及週六，走勢稍異，英美匯做小，先令本應放長，反隨美滙略縮，此外紗巿忽見挺秀，滙劃貼現欲跌又止，其間雖不免補空及月底假前作用，但巿塲中不免躍躍欲試之意。</p>
<h3>煤球廠盤加價</h3>
<p>煤球廠盤、前週因先令回鬆、成木减輕、外表雖仍擯持、暗盤會一度降落、以資競爭、日昨因某項不利傳說、南洋·國華·義泰興·煤球價又堅挺、同業批發、一概加足、自車一百四十八元、送到另加車力、本街門莊零售每担概售八元云、</p>
<h3>府紅棗到百包</h3>
<p>府紅棗市上號貨早已告斷、行方手存亦已有限、故市勢頗勁、昨靑島帮聞有運到一百包、叫價三十八元、因行方還價離譜、尚未成交、</p>
<h3>荷赤回升八角</h3>
<p>昨糖市趨勢續緊、赤白糖一致回好、公會劃盤現貨二四組白、本棧六十九元四角、外棧六十九元、升五角、轉口五十五元、升一元、太古車白B嘜、初為七十八元半、後仍到七十九元、荷赤五十六元半至五十六元八角、前後升八角、國糖興化大宮粉會叫百元、但乏成交、昨開出普通宮粉三十包、八十六元五角、</p>
<h3>生粉西谷米　交易零星</h3>
<p>生粉市存不乏、近以去路轉懈、日來僅有零星交易、其勢見較、刻飛麒麟標售六十七元、KG與三X　標同為六十五元、雙TA嘜五十五元、孔雀五十五元、TT標五十二元、三〇標四十五元、比前鬆落元許、大粒西谷米仍售九十元、小敉者八十八元、小去二元、</p>
<h3>召枝鬆落四五元</h3>
<p>召枝近來雖無到貨、然去路轉稀、故市存尚稱充實、目前僅有零星交易、號盤亦見鬆落、較之前市最高價的下跌四五碼之度、</p>
<h3>桂圓肉高昂</h3>
<p>桂圓肉運來到貨無繼、而碼生晒貨更久無運來、以致市存告斷、聞零星存貨、曾售至二百十元，，昨據產區函訊、存已有限、而產價亦高至二百元、加上一切外費、自難合算、故在新貨未出以前、難望再到云、</p>
<h3>竹節鋼條巿勢呆滯</h3>
<p>竹節鐲條交易、近日來除本街建築幫微有採辦外、外埠客商、一無成交、市勢殊稱呆滯、市象亦因而蕭條、業中人因抱來源缺乏之念、行情不肯大量放鬆、雖無多量之成交、然空盤亦須居昂、刻市如三分四分每噸售一千三百五十元、五分至一寸每噸售一千三百元、均未見有驚人之下降云、聞前交易祇十餘噸光景、建築幫與零星買戶分勝之、　批生意殊無、</p>

<h3>銀洋漲跌</h3>
<p>錢莊為市面之一大宗，而銀洋之價，朝暮無定，有一日一盤者，有一日二盤者，有一日三四盤者，此其故何也？現銀短則銀價驟增，洋絀則洋厘暴漲，貿易者雖錙銖必較，是固無足怪者。而又有取巧之流，創為空盤之舉，不用現貨交易，但以過帳為憑，買小者，日冀價之增高；買大者，日冀價之中落，貪心所至，利令智昏。初則不見現錢盈千累百，竟同無厭之求，繼則臨期結帳，接二連三，遂成無窮之悔，此風寗紹蘇杭最為盛行，而因此傾家蕩產，並性命而斷送者，亦不乏人；故官憲出示禁止，煌煌曉諭，未嘗不深切著明，特無如陽奉陰違，此風卒難凈絕。近日以來洋價漲跌屢見於報，自七錢二分零，漲至七錢六分零，今又跌至七錢四分零，加以銀拆洋拆，時有出入，此正市面盛衰之機關，商賈通塞之畛域，而買空賣空，盈於此者，必絀於彼，是恐錢店中必將有變動。滬上洋價之定盤，七錢三分零，為日已久，而近來則難免變動矣。</p>

<p>衣食住行</p>
<h3>吃素運動</h3>
<p>— 草刑</p>
<p>考吃素之風，由來已久；以其有戒殺生物的含義，所以佛門信徒奉為唯一的解條。其實就是用科學的理解來說，亦不失是一種具有平和，經濟，及衛生三大意義的好教律。</p>
<p>我們現在所以提倡吃素的宗旨，並非替佛教作宣傳，完全是應付環境，節省經濟！作者雖然三月不知肉味，聽說肉價已漲到兩塊錢一斤，其他可想而知了。像這樣昂貴的肉價，除掉富有之家有資格享受外，我們靠薪水為生的人只好朝它看看。</p>
<p>本來世間最苦惱的，就是我們這一羣。一年三百六十五天，天天為着衣食奔忙，勉強圖個溫飽。不幸遭逢亂世，受了砲火的洗禮不算，還要捱奸商們的壓榨！這次自來水的漲價，工部局的加捐，又替二房東造了機會！</p>
<p>生活的威脅，既然這樣的嚴重，我們唯一的辦法，只有從刻苦上打算，竭力節省。節省之道，固非一端，可是吃素一事，倒佔很重要的地位。雖然素菜也不便宜，究比吃葷經濟得多。至少，在消費方面，可以節省三分之一的支出。所謂「一日不多，十日許多。」這一點，不妨實地試騐。</p>
<p>有人說：「人是食肉動物，一旦長期吃素，恐怕對於身體的健康，頗有妨碍吧？」我以為這話，不盡可信；舉一個例：佛門中信徒，終生茹素，而他們的身體，並不怎樣瘦弱；壽齡倒也七十八十，甚至百歲。可見吃素並不妨碍身體，只有比吃葷清潔而衛生。</p>
<p>常見一般養生家，一入夏令，就紛紛吃素。吃素到底是有益於人生的好辦法；既經濟，又衛生，一舉兩得，我們何樂而不提倡呢？總之，不吃飯，會有餓死的危險；不吃葷，不會有性命之憂的！</p>
<h3>提倡短衣</h3>
<p>— 白水</p>
<p>身上穿一件長衫，舉動就覺得不方便，尤其在夏天。我們在電車上，常常可以看到下車者因為長衫並不拉起，以致被後面的人踏住而扯破，因而兩方面發生了爭鬧。我們自己，有時候兩手拿滿了東西，走上樓梯而無法把長衫拉起，因而常常要踏住前裾，行走不便。，所以，穿了一件長衫，舉動隨處受到妨礙，使得我們不便多動，我們便也文弱起來了。大家都說中國人的身體衰弱，缺少活動，這是原因之一，而缺少活動的原因，穿了長衫也是原因之一，所以，我們講大一些，要強國須得打倒長衫：說小一些，要自己的舉動自由方便，須得打倒長衫。在今日生活高貴，棉布價格數倍於「八一三」之前我們添製一件衣服已很為難，更那能再去花費衣料而製長衫；所以要使穿衣合於經濟原則，自然也應該打倒長衫。</p>
<p>穿了長衫，褲子不再穿了，或許可以說還合經濟原則的；然而，穿了長衫褲子還是要穿的，那長長的下裾，使其浪費了不少的衣料製則縫工比短衣要高，洗則洗工比短衣要貴，而且再加上了不方便，我們何苦去多花了錢而買一個不方便呢！</p>
<p>有人說，不穿長衫，不免禮貌不周，這真是笑話！試問穿短衣的工人階級，他們都不懂禮貌嗎？穿了長衫而傲視一切面目中無人，試問這也算是禮貌的嗎？禮貌的有不有，完全在你內心向外表現的行動山，和長衫的穿不穿是根本沒有關係的。</p>
<p>有人說：我們穿慣了長衫，不穿便覺得不好看，這也是笑話！試問廣東人，他們不穿長衫者居多數，你一走到香港，穿了長衫而躑躅街頭，在那個時候，試問你覺得自己好看不好看呢？</p>
<p>在冬天，因為天氣冷的關係，所以穿了長衣，比較可以和暖一些。至於在夏天，硬要再穿上一件長衫實在是沒有意思的。記得在「八一三」之前，上海開明書店的編輯所同人，他們不管穿中裝或是西裝，大家一律穿短衫，再因草帽遮去的太陽很微，所以大家不戴草帽而張紙傘，這舉動我以為我們很可以效法一下的。</p>
<p>總說一句話，長衫不但浪費衣料，而且妨礙舉動，我們應該要革除它；就是短衫，衣袖也不要太長，以致舉動不便，這也是很要緊的。</p>
<h3>居住偶話</h3>
<p>— 鄭逸梅</p>
<p>壁濕懸畫，足損畫幅，不懸又似太覺素寂，無以適性。厥法祗有將報紙摺疊，較畫幅狹小半寸許，用釘按貼壁上，然後再懸畫幅；如此則濕氣得以隔絕，且報紙以較狹小故，完全被畫幅遮掩，又不失觀瞻之雅。此法如李笠翁有知，亦間情偶寄之資料也。</p>
<p>樓閣籠罩於斜陽薄霧中，自有飄渺欲仙之致。偶憶某前輩有「夕陽樓閣寫秋痕」句，予謂其意境勝於丹青書畫。</p>
<p>諺云：「牡丹雖好，全憑綠葉扶持。」實則綠葉則為一種植物，非牡丹本身之葉也。一斑錄有云：「牡丹宜綠葉同種一處，則並茂」。點綴庭園者，不可不知。</p>
<p>畫幅須時常更換，則不但縑楮不致黯舊，且有調劑目光氣象煥新之妙，且山水人物花卉仕女，須參互張之，若過於單純，則意味未免較遜也。既時常更換畫幅，書義不可不備。义列置於左右，當以細斑竹為之，一端裝雲白銅义頭，雖不精琢，亦須具玲瓏織巧之致，否則粗拙惡劣，有如嬌娃而勝醜女，殊不稱合也。</p>
<p>日常用品，如酒樽茶盎，往往隨便置備，不之考究，實則凡日接於眸，日觸於手者；愈宜以發人美感爲要，不然，憎厭之念生，非所以慰藉精神也。且精美之品，不妨加意愛護，俾得恃久，亦未始非經濟之道。</p>
<p>室中器具，求新穎無寗求古雅。蓋時代推演，無有已時，不旋踵間，而新穎者屬諸陳舊矣；反不若古雅之物，一成不變，厭久如常，較為妥善也</p>
<p>琴可以陶情，劍可以抒氣，書可以勵志，畫可以寗神，此四者，居室不可不備。</p>
<p>佈置宜巧不宜宏，宜疏不宜密，宜簡不宜繁，宜澹不宜華。</p>
<p>亡友胡寄塵君，謂：「美衣服不如美房室蓋衣服之美，悅人而已。惟居室之美，始得娛已。」旨哉斯言！</p>
<p>庭園之盡處，宜多植嘉樹，使之蔭濃似惺，掩蔽垣籬，則雖盡而不覺其盡，涉身其中，庶乎無褊窄之感矣。</p>

<h3>一星期經濟菜單</h3>
<p>— 華英女士</p>
<p>豬肉和黃魚，本來是葷菜中最平凡的東西，現在豬肉買到二元一斤，黃魚也要買到六七角一斤，試問這一張經濟菜單，叫我如何開法？然而飯總是要吃的，要吃飯，又不能不吃菜；我看葷菜既吃不起，只得在可能範圍中將數量縮減，而多吃一些素菜，好在夏天天熱，吃素也是衛生之道。不見有的地方，連飯米也沒有，正在掘草根樹皮吃，能在這孤島上吃飯吃菜蔬，還是享福的哩。如今我每天雖仍開著兩樣葷菜，但是避重就輕，力求經濟，吃不吃也悉聽尊便。</p>

<h3>觀白蕉畫蘭畫果蔬</h3>
<p>— 周瘦鵑</p>
<p>日為衣食住行作牛馬走，幾不知有金石書畫之樂；而吾友雲間白蕉則適反是，日夕沈浸金石書畫中，古香古色，弸彪手眼間，雅人，亦　人也。此以所作數百事，陳於大新畫廳，七月為期；書法篆刻，不同凡俗，復出其餘畫蘭畫果蔬，亦　寢入古。邇日物價勝貴，民不聊生，即此花草果蔬，已不易致；觀白蕉畫，彌足娛目快心，可以忘飢，蓋亦望梅止渴意爾。爲賦二絕：</p>
<p>一花一葉寫湘魂，漫道書生結習存，中有無　憂國淚，流經九畹種愁恨。</p>
<p>才流百輩無餐飯，太息長安不易居，臣朔竭來飢欲死，從君乞取畫中蔬。（按首句爲襲定愈句，今日襲用之，以詠時艱，誰曰不宜。）</p>
<h3>蕩馬路</h3>
<p>— 赤耳</p>
<p>普通一般人認為「蕩馬路」是有損無益的，無事還是在家裏坐坐，現在是亂世多事，免得出外受到意外的災禍；這種論調也是對的，但我却不以為然：因為我們在工作完畢後，在家覺得氣悶，還是到馬路上去走走，一方面可以散散步，藉此恢復身心上的疲乏，同時又可以留心社會上的動態，如洞悉路旁的象棋攤，舊貨攤，撲克牌等小騙局，以及看看兩旁的玻璃櫥窗內所陳列的東西，五花百門，美不勝收，開開眼界，曉得實價等；總之，在蕩馬路的時候，能夠時時注意，處處留心，沒有一處不能得到些嘗識的，清朝的會文正公說：「隨處留心皆是學」，我想這句話是對極了：因為宇宙之大，無奇不有，在學校中書本上所得知識是有限的，將來在社會上感覺到不敷應用，須得再求些活的知識來補充補充；又何樂而不為呢？</p>
<p>最後，我得聲明的就是請大家不要誤會，當作我是提倡「蕩馬路」的。須知這個須在工作完成後方能實行，因為本位的工作也忙得了不得，那有工夫去蕩馬路呢？現在我說的是有空閒的時候做的，決不是「馬路蕩」所做的「蕩馬路」啊。至於路上多危險，那祗要留心一些，不要湊熱鬧，軋鬧忙就得了。（移酬救難）</p>
<h3>食養小志　梅</h3>
<p>— 張鏡人</p>
<p>梅爲　業喬木之一種，犯寒者花，影滿水月，香遠益清，目目何遜材和靖品題之後，益增顏色；故每值歲尾年頭，詩人墨客，咸引爲書窗之清供焉。其花露實仁藥　梗根，均堪入藥，單藥綠葉者最良，含苞者力較勝，實結餘夏日梅雨時節，未熟色爲翠綠，成熟後則呈杏黃而間紅色，味酸多液。相傳　武帝與軍十失道，大渴而無水，遂令曰：前有梅林，結子甘酸，可以止渴。士卒聞之，皆口中水出，乃得及泉源，其生津之力，亦可以知矣。古時採取曝幹爲　　　　，而調和鼎　，亦以為上品，尚書曰：若作和　，爾惟　梅，蓋取其酸也。明時有以白梅肉少許，浸雪水，潤花露一宿，蜜浸　酒，曰，蜜漬梅花，又有梅花粥，則取落央和入熟米粥中，而再煮食之，尚有用半開花溶蠟到花口投蜜罐中，過時以一兩朵同蜜一匙點沸湯服，曰梅花湯，楊誠齋有脫蕊收將熬粥吃及蜜點梅花帶露餐之句，殆即指此。然此數法，俱屬文人好弄助雅之舉，若近人取黃熟梅榨汁加入紫蘇和糖製之梅醬，經年不敗，可和入麵包等物，夏季酷暑，又可代作冷飲，其法取梅醬二三佐，以涼開水沖飲，甘美遠勝市間所售果子露，且最合衛生。紫蘇散風寒，解飢表，治暑溼泄瀉，止霍亂轉筋，創法之時　實寓深意，但人多未之知耳。予因喜歡梅水，故亦喜閱梅詩，惟歷代詠梅寶者極少，最愛羅隱紅梅一首曰：天賜胭脂一抹腮盤中磊洛笛中哀，雖然未得知　便，曾爲將軍止渴來。讀者至此，其亦覺津津有味乎。</p>

<h3>五種社會福利事業的發動</h3>
<p>— 溪南</p>
<p>最近馮炳南君爲其母壽，他預備組織社會福利事業社，拿出一筆錢作為教育人員，新聞從業人員，宗教，失業自助及健康互保會五種補助基金。他爲什麽先指定這五種事業？在他沒有說明他的用意以前無從加以推測。不過就他平昔言行觀之，他是極富於人類同情心的人，他常與友朋間談話，要提出「為人類謀忠」及「自助，助人，互助」作為談話資料。他以爲人類中最值得欽佩的是自食其力。所以他說黃包車夫職業雖卑微，而用血汗換取金錢，是可欽佩的。最可恥是不勞而獲，無論他如何威赫勢要，然面其心其行，卑鄙之極了。他以為責任最重大的是教員和新聞記者，這是人人都知道的，用不着多說。然而他們生活，亦最是清苦，最為辛勤，要提高他們的待遇，固然是另一問題，要看他專業本身的能力如何。但是在社會方面，不可漠視他的勞績，也不可儘管自顧享用安適，而置真正對人製大有貢獻的人們一切於不顧，未免太不公尤，亦太冷酷了。雖則明知欲辦理得好，不是一件易事，可是認為事所當爲的，不應以其難而不為，所以應該籌一筆補助基金，對於造福社會人製卓著勞績的教員和新聞記者，有一點補助。這一種補助，不但是物質上的酬報，也可說是一種榮譽獎金。又如清貧的新聞記者，身後蕭條，撫養遺孤等等，也應該給予一點補助。其次他以為人生最痛苦的莫如疾病，除非真正生活寬裕的人們，尚可應付外，大概薪水階級的人們，無論收入如何，生活多已到了最痛苦的階段。再加以病魔纏擾，肉體上苦痛已不可當，精神上苦痛，更加利害，無病尚且防病，有病更要加病了。所以他蓄心要解除一般薪水階級病痛的煎熬，不至有病不能得到良好的醫藥，反而爲病所厄，而到失業破產的地步。想設計出一種好的辦法，使入社的遇有疾病，皆得到良好醫治的機會，免致加重他人生的苦悶生活的壓迫。至於失業問題，在當今社會問題中居着首座，但是他以為解決這問題，專　着本業吸收，和別人的救濟，是需費多而收效難；他是主張自助助人，自立立人的。所以他以為解決失業問題要從失業者互助做起，不是互相介紹職業，即是互相合作一種事業，用以解決自己的困難。</p>
<p>他對於我們新聞記者批評，也是有的，他說：爲什麽現在的報紙多登誨淫誨盜的這一類新聞廣告，或許是投社會所好，或許是營業關係，也或許以為有儆戒爲惡的意思；但是看得不當心，只看見如何盜，如何淫，而不看淫盜的結果去了，他以為社會病態的新聞既然不能不登，社會好的方面新聞更應該登了。尤其是要主張公道，明是非，提倡學術，促進道德。很應該多登載當代嘉言懿行，忠義節烈的新聞，獎勵人們去為善，這不能說是報館有所阿私，只要拿事實來證明。人事新聞中最好多登些科舉新發明，工業新制作，使人們看到了，於感覺興趣之外，得到一種鼓勵，好使他聞風興起，造成良好的社會，道是新聞記者的應有職責！</p>
<p>以上所云，不能說是馮炳南君辦理這事的動機所在，不過就我聞見所及，略知他的用意罷了。他真正的用意所在，我想，必有他自己正式發表之一日。至於宗教補助基金，他是要想從發揚教義，改善一般教徒的生活形式，要使他有益於社會，毋向社會去分利。</p>
<h3>業餘漫談　白浪滔天的婚姻問題</h3>
<p>— 史偉</p>
<p>在我們社會還沒有進入合理化之前，社會的本身是有缺陷的；因之，生活在這個社會里的人們，便要碰到各式各樣的問題了。</p>
<p>職工們是最艱苦的一幫，所以他們是首當其衝地碰着各式各樣的問題的。</p>
<p>今天我們就來談談白浪滔天的婚姻問題。</p>
<p>我們不是清教徒，我們都是滿足十個月生出來的人。我們的生理上有性的要求。我們當然需要圓滿的性生活。</p>
<p>但是，性生活僅是一個人的整個生活的一部份，當今天我們爲了整個生活而奮鬥的時候，我們是否一定要求得性生活的滿足呢？並且是否能求得滿足？反過來說：我們是不能祗爲着性生活的滿足而置整個生活於不管的。</p>
<p>無庸否認，在我們青年的職工中間，有很多人正在拼命地追求異性，而大部份都因此而忘卻了事業，耽擱了工作的；我們覺得這種傾向是不能使它繼續發展的。否則，從小處講，個人的前途會成問題。從大處講，絕非國家社會之福。</p>
<p>我們絕對擁護由戀愛的進展而發展到結婚的那種理想的婚姻。但我們反對要事業去服從戀愛的那種「戀愛至上主義」！</p>
<p>歷史上證明，而且正有千萬人在實騐，我們是有方法來克服生理上的「性感」的。那就是：有爲事業奮鬥的信心，有良好的業餘活動的調劑，有正確的精神食糧的吸收…等等，</p>
<p>順便要提一下的，有些人正在東借西賒地來準備結婚，祗看到眼前的滿足，而不考慮到婚後的生活問題，這是很危險的。我們一方面要盡量減少儀式的費用，另方面一定要使妻子參加生產工作。否則的話，那熱鬧的結婚儀式不是要變成悲劇的前奏曲了嗎？</p>
<p>另外，我們也擁護因不滿買賣式的婚姻而向家庭抗議的人。但是要注意，不是每一個父母作主的對象都是不行的，我們應儘量來爭取研究對象的機會，來考察她（他）是否好或壞，是否有發展前途，以及對自己的信仰…等等。</p>
<p>鳴謝　雲間白蕉先生，精於金石書盡，宿爲僕所欽佩，自今日起在大新盡廳開展七日，以供海內識者共賞，蒙贈邀帖兩紙，傳得一飽眼福，特此鳴謝。　春秋編輯部啟</p>
<h3>霍桑探案　舞后的歸宿</h3>
<p>— 程小青著</p>
<p>第二章　「一頁往史！」</p>
<p>倪金壽的眼光一閃，雖　霍桑，似表示這案子已有了一綫曙光。霍桑卻並不理會他，但伸手從衣袋中摸出剛才放進去的兩張照片來。他抽出較大的一張，疊了起來給金梅　。</p>
<p>「是這個人嗎？」</p>
<p>金梅略略抬起些目光，在照片上瞧了一瞧，便點點頭。</p>
<p>霍桑道：「他叫什麽？」</p>
<p>「甘棠－－余甘棠。」</p>
<p>霍桑將照片重新放入衣袋中。「哎，姜小姐說你的之人是這余甘棠打死的。那末，伊可曾說什麽理由？」</p>
<p>「沒有，伊祗說要去看你。」</p>
<p>倪金壽瞧着霍桑問道：「還姓姜的女子已來看過你嗎？」</p>
<p>霍桑道：「見過的，在你打電話給我以前。伊祗叫我馬上到這裏來察勘，絕不曾發表什麽意見。不過伊曾答應我，別的話再細談。」</p>
<p>倪金壽點點頭。「那也好，我們停一回儘可以直接問伊。」</p>
<p>霍桑不答。他的眼光依舊注射在那女僕臉上。</p>
<p>他又說：「金梅，據你看，姜小姐這句話究竟有沒有意思？」</p>
<p>金梅又遲疑了一下。伊的右手在玩弄那件毛葛旗袍的腰部以下的紐扣，一回兒解開，一回兒又鈕上。</p>
<p>「我說不出什麽。我不知道。」　（三一）</p>

<h3>The South China Army of Guangdong Counterattacks and Wins; The Japanese Retreat from Shenzhen and Nantou; The Situation at the Hong Kong Border Remains Precarious as Roads are Destroyed by Rain; American Mail Steamer Ordered to Return to Hong Kong to Evacuate Residents</h3>
<p>Yingde: The Japanese, who had invaded Henggang, Longgang, Pingshan, and other places, have been fiercely counterattacked by the Chinese troops for several days, suffering heavy casualties. By the 27th, the Japanese were unable to withstand the attacks and retreated to Shenzhen, Nantou, and other places. As of now, there are no traces of the Japanese near Henggang, Longgang, and Pingshan. The Chinese army is advancing towards ××. (30th dispatch)</p>
<p>Hong Kong: According to reliable border sources last night, recent heavy rains have brought the Japanese military operations along the Hong Kong border to a standstill. Yesterday, the Japanese did not continue to advance towards the Hong Kong border. The highway from Nantou to the border was destroyed by the rain, and it will take three weeks to restore traffic. During the same period, aircraft are also unable to land on the border. (United Press, 30th dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: According to Chinese reports, the Japanese army in South China is attempting to advance from Hong Kong towards the border of Indochina. In addition, several Japanese units set out from Shilong on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway on Wednesday, apparently to reinforce the Japanese army in Shenzhen. However, they were blocked at Xiabeng (also a station on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, transliteration). Furthermore, according to front-line Chinese news, the Japanese troops departing from Shilong and Dongguan towards the railway have encountered Chinese troops in battle and are unable to connect. Chinese reports also state that the Chinese army has launched a three-pronged attack on the Japanese army advancing along the highway between Nanning and Longzhou, while the Japanese have sent 3,000 reinforcements to Nanning to rescue the besieged troops. (United Press, 30th dispatch)</p>
<p>Hong Kong: The U.S. State Department has ordered the American mail steamer President Coolidge to return to Hong Kong. The ship departed from Hong Kong for Manila only twelve hours ago. Next Friday, 4,000 British women and children will be evacuated to Manila. American sources here believe that the U.S. government's order for the President Coolidge to return to Hong Kong is to load American citizens for departure. However, the American Consul General here stated that the consulate has not received any instructions from Washington. The President Coolidge left Hong Kong for Manila at 6:00 AM this morning, carrying ninety first-class passengers and thirty-five tourist class passengers, most of whom had reserved tickets. Their purpose should not be regarded as refugees. After receiving the American order, the ship returned to Hong Kong at 6:00 PM, exactly twelve hours after its departure. (United Press, 30th dispatch)</p>
<p>Guangzhou: The Japanese army in South China issued a statement this morning, saying that whenever the Hong Kong authorities were notified 24 hours in advance of Japanese military operations along the border, they would leak Japanese military secrets to Chongqing. This was said to be based on a written order issued by General Chiang Kai-shek for the Chinese army to withdraw from the border area, which mentioned information obtained from the British authorities. The statement also said that the Japanese would no longer provide information about their operations in the border areas, for which they expressed their regret. (Reuters, 30th dispatch)</p>
<p>Hong Kong: The mail steamer President Coolidge (21,936 tons), which left here for Manila this morning, suddenly returned here this afternoon without announcement, suggesting that instructions may have arrived from Washington to evacuate American women and children from Hong Kong.

<h3>British and French Far East Policies Remain Unchanged; Vietnamese Nationalist Party Asks for Japanese Aggression to be Stopped</h3>
<p>Chongqing: According to a Central News Agency dispatch, the British and French ambassadors recently decided here, as a result of talks, that the British and French authorities in China would continue to cooperate on Far Eastern affairs. The news agency continued, stating that even if the Japanese exerted pressure on Hong Kong and Vietnam, British and French Far Eastern policies would remain unchanged. Furthermore, the Vietnamese Nationalist Party has issued a petition requesting the Chongqing National Government to quickly take effective measures to stop the Japanese from seizing Vietnam. The petition stated, "If France does not want to forfeit its historical honor and does not want to see the French Empire reduced to a state of eternal ruin, then it is not too late to salvage the current situation. Indochina, with its abundant resources and large population, can provide all the resources for France's revival. France's acceptance of Japanese demands is absolutely unforgivable. Our party, representing the people of Indochina, expresses our desire, hoping that the French government will immediately restore the freedoms of speech, publication, assembly, and armament to the people of Indochina. Under these conditions, we are willing to cooperate with France and will not hesitate to engage in war to resist the aggressors of Asia. If France ignores the needs of its people, we will not sit idly by and watch our future destiny. France has an obligation to protect Indochina, but no right to sell it. We request that the Chinese National Government quickly take effective measures to prevent changes to the sovereignty of Vietnam and provide our party with the highest assistance. We are willing to fulfill the obligation to protect Vietnam under the cooperation of the Chinese, French, and Vietnamese governments." (United Press, 30th dispatch)</p>
<p>Guangzhou: The first ship evacuating British women and children from Hong Kong, carrying 600 people, set sail from Hong Kong for Manila early this morning. (Haitong News Agency, 20th dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo: According to the "Asahi Shimbun," the Japanese army has occupied Zhennanguan, an important town on the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, less than one mile from the Sino-Vietnamese border. (Haitong News Agency, 30th dispatch)</p>
<p>Hong Kong has already declared martial law.</p>
<p>Stockholm: A British Foreign Office spokesperson stated to foreign reporters yesterday that the world's attention has now shifted from Romania to the Far East. London received official reports yesterday morning confirming that Hong Kong has declared martial law. Since the start of the Sino-Japanese War, Hong Kong only declared martial law once, on June 12, 1937. This time, it is because Japanese warships will declare a blockade of the entire Chinese coast starting next Wednesday (July 3), which will completely isolate Hong Kong, hence the need to take martial law measures. The British Governor has instructed British women and children to evacuate first, indicating that the situation is very critical. Within the next two days, 600 women and children will be sent to Manila. According to a London radio report, the Australian government has announced its willingness to receive the evacuees from Hong Kong, so British citizens will be transferred to Australia after arriving in Manila. Regarding this matter, the United Kingdom is consulting with the U.S. government, with Ambassador Lord Lothian discussing solutions with U.S. Secretary of State Hull. Australian representatives also participated in the meeting yesterday, with very detailed discussions on protecting the Far Eastern interests of the United Kingdom and the United States. London acknowledges that Japan's attitude towards the United Kingdom has become more assertive in recent days. Although the blockade of the British and French concessions in Tianjin has just been lifted, Foreign Minister Arita's notification to British Ambassador Craig has made the situation suddenly serious. Arita declared that in the future, Japan would not tolerate any assistance from Western countries to the Chinese Central Government under any circumstances. According to Arita's interpretation, "assistance" includes (1) military supplies, (2) military equipment, (3) raw materials, and (4) economic assistance. Arita emphasized that Far Eastern countries have direct and natural relationships in terms of geography, history, race, and economy, and must help each other. Any third country engaging in anti-Japanese activities in the Far East will not be tolerated by Japan. (Haitong News Agency, 30th dispatch)</p>
<p>Soviet newspapers pay attention to the situation in Vietnam.</p>
<p>Moscow: Since the obstruction of transportation between Vietnam and the mainland, Soviet newspapers have been constantly monitoring the development of events in the Far East. The publication of the Chinese Foreign Ministry's protest to the Vietnamese government by the Central News Agency, and the reactions of various Chinese newspapers to this, have been featured prominently in Soviet newspapers.

At the same time, Susi near Yanglousi was also captured, with many captured enemy troops. (29th dispatch)</p>
<p>Miluo: Fierce fighting continues in the Yanglousi and Yangloudong areas. In recent days, the Chinese army has been winning victories through surprise tactics, capturing many enemy troops. (30th dispatch)</p>
<p>Fancheng: More than 10,000 Japanese troops from Jingmen and Dangyang retreated to Jiangling on the 27th, and the local Chinese people suffered greatly along the way. In addition, dozens of Japanese trucks, fully loaded with steel helmets and military equipment, were transported from Dangyang to Jiangling. It is heard that the Japanese suffered heavy losses in the battle of Banyueshan in Dangyang, and these steel helmets and military equipment were left behind by the casualties. (29th dispatch)</p>
<p>Xiangyang: Fierce fighting broke out between Chinese and Japanese forces in Yunmengshan, Sunbinyan, Jiajiadi, Dagutai, and other places northwest of Dangyang. Chinese officers and soldiers bravely charged and repeatedly entered the Japanese陣地. The fighting continued until the evening of the 26th, with an estimated 500 Japanese killed. They were still fighting fiercely at midnight. (29th dispatch)</p>
<p>Luoyang: A unit of the Chinese army in eastern Henan launched an attack on Kaifeng. On the evening of the 29th, the Chinese army had reached the vicinity of the suburbs of Kaifeng. After a fierce attack throughout the night, at 2:00 AM on the morning of the 30th, the Chinese army rushed into the city walls from the southwest and west in succession, engaging in fierce street fighting with the Japanese, occupying the city center, and pressing the Japanese into the southeastern corner of the city, intensifying the encirclement. The Japanese suffered heavy casualties. In addition, the Chinese army attacking Nanguan encountered the main force of the Japanese, and a bayonet fight occurred. However, the Japanese eventually could not withstand the attack and retreated into the city. The Chinese army occupied the Nanda Causeway. Later, the Japanese sent tanks to reinforce and counterattack. The outskirts of Kaifeng are still in fierce fighting. The Bianxin Road unit has destroyed much of the roadbed. The Yellow River Railway Bridge has also been burned by the Chinese, and the Bianxin Road has been cut off. (30th dispatch)</p>
<p>The Eastern Henan Puppet Army: Three Divisions Revolt</p>
<p>Luoyang: Zhou Lanyi, the puppet pacification director of eastern Henan, commands three divisions of puppet troops, the strongest force among the puppet armies in eastern Henan. Previously, under environmental pressure, he had no choice but to temporarily submit to the Japanese. Now that the time has come, Li Zhiyi and Zhao Renjie, the two division commanders of the unit, took the lead, breaking away from the Japanese army, which received enthusiastic support from the entire unit. On the 29th, they revolted simultaneously at their original stations, starting to kill the Japanese and concentrating in the ×× area. To show their determination, the families of the unit's senior officers have begun to cross the river together. Yang Fang, of the Li Division, was originally stationed in Tuocheng. After receiving the secret order to revolt, he first detained the Japanese team leader (number and name under investigation) stationed in Tuocheng, and wiped out several hundred Japanese soldiers.

<h3>Weekly Battle Situation: June 23rd to 29th</h3>
<p>The Chinese army is using magnet tactics, attracting the enemy step by step to achieve the goal of gradual annihilation. The Japanese, who were plotting in Guangdong and Guangxi, have not succeeded under the fierce attacks of the Chinese army. The Chinese army on the other fronts has also inflicted great defeats on the stubborn Japanese, repeatedly winning victories. The progress of the battle is summarized as follows:</p>
<p>On the west bank of the Xiang River in Hubei Province, the main force of the Japanese army is still in Dangyang and its eastern region. In addition, in the Jingmen, Yichang, and Jiangling areas, the Japanese also have considerable forces stubbornly defending. In Shenjiaji, Shayang, and Shilipu, there are a small number of Japanese troops hiding in the towns, not daring to move rashly. Since last week, the Chinese defending army has completed a strong encirclement of the Japanese in each location and continued to carry out the most violent attacks. Seeing the dangerous situation, the Japanese strengthened their fortifications and stubbornly held out. However, after the Chinese army's planned separate encirclement and suppression, the remaining peripheral units of the Japanese army in each location have been wiped out, and the goal of attracting the Japanese and annihilating them gradually has been successfully achieved. At the same time, the Chinese elite troops in the rear launched brave attacks in Hubei, capturing various crossings of the Xiang River and encircling Zhongshen and Yangzi. In southern Hubei, they fiercely attacked Chongyang, Tongcheng, and Xianning, recovering Zhaoliqiao and cutting off the Japanese army's transportation on the northern section of the Yuehan Railway. In eastern Hubei, they rushed into Donglousi, Huayuan, and other places, and attacked Wushengguan, forcing the Japanese. The traffic on the southern section of the Pinghan Railway was also completely controlled by the Chinese army. Where the large army arrived, they repeatedly defeated the stubborn Japanese, causing the Japanese who ventured blindly in the western Xiang River area to have their rear lines cut off, falling into a state of panic and despair.</p>
<p>Since being defeated by the Chinese army last week, the Japanese army invading Shangsi, Suilu, Funan, and other places in southern Guangxi, taking advantage of the changes in the European situation, resumed their westward offensive in two routes. The main force moved along Mingjiang and Tutu towards Ningming, and a part crossed the Zuojiang River and invaded Chongshan, aiming to threaten Annam by joining forces to attack Longzhou. The Chinese army launched fierce attacks separately, capturing thousands of enemy troops. Fierce fighting is still ongoing. Since the beginning of the month, the Japanese army in southern Guangdong has invaded the area north of Conghua and was severely defeated and retreated. Last week, the</p>
<p>Chongqing: A spokesman for the Military Affairs Commission said that the fighting this week was still more intense west of the Xiang River. The main force of the invading Japanese army landed at Nantou, which belongs to Bao'an County, and invaded Shenzhen, Shatoujiao, Shayuchong, Longgang, Pingshan, and other places to the east, forming a large encirclement around Kowloon, attempting to control Dapeng Bay and threaten British Hong Kong. They are now being fiercely countered by the Chinese.</p>
<p>The Chinese army in northern Hunan and Jiangxi launched rapid and skillful actions to attack Japanese strongholds, making rapid and smooth progress. They successively captured many strongholds near Yanglousi, and recovered the important strategic location of Huxingshan on the outskirts of Yueyang, annihilating many Japanese troops. The Chinese army attacking Nanchang fiercely in northern Jiangxi took advantage of the victory to advance, successively capturing important strongholds such as Cimu, Wanchu, Chazan on the southeast side of Nanchang, and Shengmi Street on the southwest side. The Japanese repeatedly decided to reinforce and counterattack, but were defeated each time, killing more than 2,000 Japanese troops, destroying many tanks, capturing more than 20 heavy and light machine guns, and capturing more than 70 Japanese officers and soldiers. The Chinese mobile units also moved towards the rear of the Japanese, destroying major road bridges and attacking the Japanese airfield east of Nanchang, capturing many enemy troops and destroying many Japanese vehicles. In addition, after the Chinese army captured Songbu and other places, they are currently besieging Anyi. Many strongholds near Wuning have also been captured. The Japanese have repeatedly attempted to counterattack, but have not succeeded. They are still closely encircling and attacking the Japanese. (To be continued, 30th dispatch)</p>
<h3>Southeast of Nanchang: The Chinese Army Captures Many Strongholds; Part of the Surprise Troops Advance to the Eastern Suburbs of the City</h3>
<p>Fengcheng: The fighting southeast of Nanchang is actively unfolding. Zhuhe Bridge, Chenzhuang, Xunshang, and Qinluojiaji have all been captured. Part of the Chinese surprise troops advanced to Taozhutong in the eastern suburbs of Nanchang, attacking Nanchang. (30th dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Japanese Army in Northwestern Shanxi: The Invasion Fails</h3>
<p>Xi'an: The Japanese and puppet forces in northwestern Shanxi recently launched a large-scale invasion in three routes. One route advanced from Sanchabao to Shaqquan Town, and another route sneaked into Ta'ershe (south of Baode) from Xingxian at noon on the 22nd. They were all defeated separately by the Chinese army.

<p>Guilin: The Second Delegation of the Nanyang Overseas Chinese Comfort Mission was hosted by the Guilin Branch of the Anti-Aggression Association on the 30th. At 3:30 PM, the head of the delegation, Chen Zhonghui, went to the broadcasting station to broadcast a speech (the dynamics of the Nanyang Overseas Chinese's work to save the country). At 9:00 PM, Chen led some of the delegation members by car to a certain place to present a banner to a military officer. After returning to Guilin, they ended their delegation duties.

<h3>Triplets Born from One Pregnancy: All Three Simultaneously Request to Enlist</h3>
<p>Ningxia: Xu Rang, the civil affairs officer of the first district of Tongxin County, has three younger brothers who were born from one pregnancy to his mother. This year, they are all sixteen years old. Because Xu Rang repeatedly heard Chairman Ma's earnest talks on the significance of the war of resistance and the obligation of the people to serve in the military when he came to the province for training two months ago, he was deeply moved. After returning to the county, he discussed with his mother, expressing his willingness to send his three younger brothers into the army to serve the country. His mother also understood the importance of the matter and expressed her strong support. Thus, a few days ago, she personally sent the three sons born from one pregnancy to the province, requesting that Chairman Ma inspect and accept them. Chairman Ma, because the three sons of the Xu family had not yet reached the age of conscription, immediately sent them to the junior cadre training class established by the Provisional × Division for training and gave them generous rewards. It has been found that it is rare in ancient and modern times for triplets to be born from one pregnancy and all have grown up, and it is especially commendable that the common woman Xu sent three sons to join the army at the same time.

<h3>How to Rebuild the World Order</h3>
<p>The various events that have occurred one after another recently have plunged the world almost entirely into an abyss of turmoil, causing the vast majority of nations and peoples to experience unparalleled suffering in life and spirit. Only a few who are engaged in conquest and domination are smug. Although similar experiences are not difficult to find in history, the scope and impact of these current events are vastly different from any previous precedents.</p>
<p>The vast majority of people are deeply saddened by the formation of this situation, but those who are engaged in conquest and domination also have their arguments: for example, saying "This is a struggle between 'haves' and 'have-nots,'" "This is to ensure regional security," "This is to promote world order and peace," "This is to implement a plan to transform the world." Opposed to this kind of argument is power, not theory; moreover, at the juncture when all means have failed and one finally has no choice but to resort to war, theoretical disputes are even less of a question. Although the abyss of turmoil is only a temporary abnormal phenomenon, the normal demands of mankind are not turmoil but lasting peace and stability; therefore, how a world order can be truly established has become an issue that must be seriously considered.</p>
<p>An order that hopes to maintain lasting peace and stability must be built on a foundation of absolute equality to be effective; and its participants must also be out of a voluntary desire, not forced and out of helplessness. If it is entirely due to the oppression of force, or is only to carry out the will of the dominators, then even if a superficial order is created with difficulty, it will be difficult to achieve stability and durability; the existence of internal contradictions, even if temporarily at peace, will eventually lead to the outbreak of new conflicts or disturbances. Looking at the current example, did the Treaty of Versailles not once bring order and peace? However, on the other hand, it was precisely because of the lack of the above-mentioned basic considerations that it became the fuse for the European War and the recent disputes. There are truly countless examples of this kind in history; it is a pity that the effect of its lessons has not been deeply developed, and instead, some people have intensified their efforts, saying that order and peace can be established under conquest and domination, which is fundamentally a logic of domination.</p>
<p>Between people, there was also a stage in the past where the phenomenon of the strong bullying the weak and the many bullying the few existed. But finally, with the progress of human civilization, in today's society, generally speaking, everyone has the same right to survival and freedom. But between countries, the traditions of the barbaric era still remain to this day. Small and weak countries still cannot obtain the guarantee of survival and freedom. Sometimes they are subjected to horizontal oppression, sometimes they are tragically sacrificed, and sometimes their survival is even threatened; but they cannot find a place to accept their complaints and provide strong and effective support. This is one of the most unreasonable situations in the international community today, and at the same time, it is the main reason for some wars. A small and weak country under the control of a strong country not only is not enough to guarantee the safety of the weak, but instead promotes the danger of another kind of war—a war for hegemony. To re-divide the world is nothing more than to divide the opposing forces in the international community more sharply and clearly, so the future disasters of war are even more terrible. Therefore, if one wants to re-establish world order, one must first ensure that the weak and the strong have the same right to survival, realize absolute equality and freedom, and completely eliminate all phenomena of conquest and domination. These are the most basic conditions, and to talk about order without this basic premise is either ignorance or deception.</p>
<p>In today's world, where violence is rampant and justice is hidden, mankind's calamity is unknown when it will end. Therefore, only using strength to fight against the darkness is the only way to solve all problems; but the above is a basic belief that is worth adhering to at all times. As long as this world does not perish due to the arrival of brute force, the reconstruction of the future international order must take the struggle of the weak to obtain free and equal survival as the beginning of light.</p>
<h3>Axis Powers Exert Pressure on Hungary and Bulgaria to Prevent the European War from Spreading to the Balkans; Bidding Them to Fully Focus on Dealing with the War Against Britain; Romanian King Carol Seeks Aid in Rome</h3>
<p>Rome: Roman sources share the same perspective as Berlin regarding a peaceful resolution to the Soviet-Romanian issue. Well-informed Italian sources claim that one of the main objectives of the Axis powers is to maintain peace in the Balkans and prevent the expansion of the European war. Regarding the Hungarian-Bulgarian issue, Italian figures believe it can be addressed after the most pressing European problems are resolved. (Haitong Telegram, 30th)</p>
<p>Budapest: The atmosphere here greatly eased yesterday, as authoritative sources reported that Italy has advised Hungary and Bulgaria to exercise patience. They were told to wait until Britain is defeated before making demands on Romania. Official circles believe Berlin has informed Rome that demands on the Danube should be temporarily postponed until Britain surrenders, to avoid conflict with Romania or the Soviet Union. (United Press Telegram, 30th)</p>
<p>Bucharest: Two million Romanian soldiers are now prepared to resist any threats to partition the country's territory. However, officials state there is no immediate danger of war. According to unconfirmed but reliable reports last night, King Carol of Romania is currently in Rome, hoping Italian Prime Minister Mussolini will prevent actions by Hungary and Bulgaria. Last night, authoritative sources told United Press reporters that Germany and Italy have not given Romania guarantees regarding the Soviet Union's entry into Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina. This is because Romania has accepted the Soviet Union's promise to fully respect Romania's borders, and the Axis powers see no need to provide Romania with guarantees. Romanian troops have now arrived at their new borders. (United Press Telegram, 30th)</p>
<p>Bucharest: Official circles here deny foreign reports that the Soviet Union is demanding bases on the Danube and the Black Sea, and refute rumors of border clashes between Romania and Hungary, and Romania and Bulgaria. Romanian newspapers consider the loss of Bessarabia and Bukovina an unavoidable matter. The pro-German "Current Affairs" newspaper hopes that what Romania has lost now can soon be restored with German assistance. Political figures fear that Soviet demands will extend to the Black Sea and the Tartar Strait. According to some opinions, Romania will temporarily comply with Soviet demands while rapidly strengthening its political, economic, and military cooperation with Germany. (Reuters Telegram, 30th)</p>
<p>Sofia: Bulgaria remained calm yesterday in response to Romania's mobilization. Authoritative sources also told United Press reporters that Bulgaria has not mobilized. The official number of armed forces in Bulgaria is not disclosed, but unofficial estimates range from one million to two million. The Bulgarian government appears to still be adopting peaceful means to achieve its territorial demands. According to a person close to the government, "We not only cannot reclaim Dobruja by force, but we have absolutely no intention of using force to achieve our wishes. However, we believe that if we are patient, we can peacefully reclaim the area. Moreover, we firmly believe that our demands are just. Our main goal now is to avoid war."

<p>Red Army Continues to Advance in Romanian Territory, Occupying All Ceded Areas</p>
<p>Bucharest: The Romanian General Staff issued a communiqué, stating that after Romania accepted the Soviet government's ultimatum, Soviet troops entered Bessarabia on the morning of June 28th. On the same day, Romanian troops began to withdraw, handing over the towns of Chernivtsi in Bukovina and Chisinau and Alba Iulia in Bessarabia to the Soviet Union. By noon on June 29th, the ceded areas had been handed over one after another. Romanian troops and civilians are still withdrawing according to the predetermined plan. (Reuters Telegram, 30th)</p>
<p>Moscow: Yesterday, Soviet troops continued to advance in Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina according to the original plan. Today, Soviet troops entered Storozhynets and Kitsman in Northern Bukovina, and occupied Novoselytsia and Lipcani station (south of Radauti) on the Prut River. Mechanized units have approached the Prut River, 55 kilometers southwest of Marculesti. They also reached Beltsy (80 kilometers northwest of Chisinau). Soviet paratroopers have occupied Bolgrad in southern Bessarabia, only a few kilometers from Reni, where the Danube and Prut rivers meet. (TASS Telegram, 30th)</p>
<p>Bucharest: The Propaganda Department announced that the new Soviet-Romanian border is the same as Romania's pre-World War I northern boundary, from the Soviet-Polish border along the Sasiva River to the pre-World War I boundary, and then south along the Prut River to the Danube and into the Black Sea. (United Press Telegram, 30th)</p>
<p>Romania Endures Painful Cession of Territory, Justice Will Surely Prevail One Day</p>
<p>Bucharest: Romania's new Minister of Propaganda, Alexandru Rădulescu, told the press yesterday that the Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Bukovina was a "disaster" for Romania and an unjust act. However, he also believes that the Soviet action has averted a greater disaster in Southeastern Europe. Rădulescu said, "We endure this disaster to avoid a greater one. Although we have been treated extremely unfairly, we do not feel disappointed. We have suffered, and we will continue to endure hardship. Whether justice will be granted in the future, we will unite all our forces to pursue our sacred mission until this injustice is rectified." (United Press Telegram, 30th)</p>
<h3>London Times Comments on the Balkan Situation: Three Countries Watch Each Other with Suspicion, Soviet Action Took the Lead</h3>
<p>London: The Sunday "Times" expressed doubts about whether the Soviet Union's recent occupation of Bessarabia was with German consent. In an article titled "The Soviet Action," the newspaper stated that since the collapse of France, one of Hitler's most likely actions has been to advance eastward. Stalin was eager to take the lead, so he decisively annexed Bessarabia and tightened his grip on the Baltic states. However, the Balkans are a more explosive region than the Baltic. The countries from Romania to Greece have formed an area where Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union each have separate and conflicting interests. So far, there is no sign that these three countries have reached a compromise under a partition plan. They may eventually reach such a compromise, but based on the current situation, Germany and Italy both appear surprised and unwelcome to the Soviet Union's actions. Now, three cats are standing around the food they have obtained, watching each other suspiciously. If one of them suddenly reaches out to grab it, the other two will inevitably follow. The repercussions of this matter will soon affect our allied country, Turkey. If that country had actively joined our side earlier, its position would be much stronger today. Calvinus also published an article on this matter in the Visiteur, stating that we are now witnessing the beginning, not the end, of the Romanian problem. The content of this drama is very complex and may have several acts and intermissions. The Soviet Union has no emotional attachments to the present and no illusions about the future. It will do what it should as soon as there is an opportunity. At the same time, the Soviet Union has a long-term vision and does not aim to fight the Axis powers, either now or in the future. If we think otherwise, we are neglecting the thoughts of the thoughtful. The more basic principles and the larger decisions in "Mein Kampf" can only be realized by reworking the "opening to the East" on the final scale. This is the great Teutonic expansion, from the Balkans to the Caucasus and Baku. The large-scale aggression Germany has carried out in Western and Northern Europe has gone too far in terms of Soviet interests. Therefore, it is necessary to limit Italy's activities in the Balkans. The collapse of France and the Soviet Union's advice have kept Turkey out of the war. However, from an obvious perspective, Turkey's defense will not be weakened in any way by the Axis powers. The Dardanelles and Bosporus straits must not be threatened directly or indirectly. Syria and Palestine must not fall into Italian hands. This situation is not without benefit to Britain. They are the guardians of the Eastern Mediterranean, preventing the spread of unrest. Russia, under the Soviet system, as it was under the imperial system, is now again the hope of all Slavs. This will be the fundamental instinct to resist Nazism, which seeks to degrade the Slavic race. The more Hitler seeks to change, the more he remains the same. He is now only changing his methods and the order of his procedures. Several formidable principles in "Mein Kampf" belong to the fixed foundation of his mind and purpose. Hitler will build a great empire unprecedented in history with power and racial superiority. This must be firmly established and maintain hegemony for many centuries to come, and cannot be broken. To achieve this goal, every possible strong enemy near it must be defeated and prevented from recovering. The oil and grain produced by Romania are not enough to achieve this. Unprecedented illusions and long-term hegemony require the fertile land of Ukraine and the oil fields of Baku. (Reuters Telegram, 30th)</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union Upholds a Policy of Peace; The Resolution of the Soviet-Romanian Issue Provides Clear Evidence</h3>
<p>Moscow: Regarding the Soviet troops entering Romania, "Izvestia" commented: "At 2:00 PM yesterday, our heroic Red Army began crossing the Romanian border. This border was created by the conspiracies and instigations of Western imperialists, and the Soviet Union has never recognized it. The Red Army's entry into Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina is not as conquerors. They are by no means enemies of the people there; in fact, they are friends of those forced to leave their homeland. The Red Army's advance in Romanian territory has been warmly welcomed by the people. This is a direct result of the Soviet Union's peaceful policy and the peaceful resolution of the Soviet-Romanian dispute. The Soviet-Romanian dispute over Bessarabia has lasted for 22 years. The secession of Bessarabia from the Soviet Union was directly involved in by the victors of Versailles. They took advantage of the weakness of the Soviet Union's military forces after the revolution and used various methods to weaken the Soviet Union's strength. At the same time, Soviet reactionaries also participated in this, as they only cared about the interests of their bankrupt class and disregarded the life and death of the motherland. Romania's seizure of Bessarabia was based on the decision of a certain group. This group, which called itself a group, actually had no relationship with the people of Bessarabia. The 'group' had a total of 162 members, but it decided to annex Bessarabia with only 38 votes. The Soviet Union has never recognized this injustice and destructive action. In the past 22 years, the Soviet Union has repeatedly mentioned the importance of resolving the Bessarabia issue. Most recently, at the sixth session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, Soviet People's Commissar Molotov also mentioned this issue. Although the Soviet Union has never mentioned using force to recover Bessarabia, it has also not recognized the area being seized by Romania. After Molotov delivered this speech, the Soviet Union sent an ambassador to Bucharest (the then Soviet ambassador to Romania had been vacant for two and a half years). The Soviet Union believes that the failure to resolve the issue is not the fault of Romania itself. Therefore, the Soviet Union intends to resolve it in a purely peaceful way. The resolution of the obvious dispute between the two neighboring countries is a great contribution to peace. The agreement recently concluded between the Soviet Union and Romania is especially valuable for maintaining peace, as the nature and duration of the dispute have hindered the friendly relations between the two countries. Moreover, the agreement was signed at a time when the international situation is most complex, so its value is even more precious. The flames of war have spread to various countries, and we have witnessed countless important historical changes. The knots of international contradictions caused by imperialism have been broken by swords and guns. In this environment, the Soviet Union continues its peaceful policy. Even for injustices such as the Bessarabia issue, the Soviet Union is unwilling to resort to force. Although the need to resolve the issue quickly is very clear, any dispute resolved by mutual agreement can consolidate the peace of all powers. The Soviet-Romanian agreement fully meets the above conditions. The agreement has not only resolved the Bessarabia issue but has also resolved the Northern Bukovina issue, which is related to the issue. Northern Bukovina has close ties to Soviet Ukraine in terms of language and structure. Since the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the workers and peasants of Bukovina have demanded that the province be incorporated into Soviet Ukraine. This demand was made by the National Assembly of the area at that time. In short, the incorporation of Bukovina into Romania was also instigated by the then omnipotent Little Entente. The so-called unanimous demand of Romanians to annex Bukovina is a fabrication. From this point of view, the resolution of the Soviet-Romanian dispute is also the resolution of another unjust historical event. Moreover, Romania's rule over Bessarabia for 22 years has caused great losses to the Soviet Union. The transfer of Northern Bukovina to the Soviet Union can be used to compensate for the losses to the Soviet Union. Whether it is the Soviet Union or the people of Bessarabia, they oppose the province being ruled by Romania. They have suffered oppression and hardship under 22 years of rule. This can be proved by the repeated uprisings of the people of the province. The Soviet Union has now opened up a great socialist path for Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina. They will move forward hand in hand with their Soviet brothers, protected by the Stalin Constitution and the great Red Army. Undoubtedly, the poverty of the past has disappeared, and from now on, the people of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina will enjoy a happy and comfortable life. In the bloody battlefield of capitalism, the great Soviet Union, in obedience to the will of the people and its leaders, remains aloof from the situation. The Soviet Union is now working hard to resolve all disputes in order to eliminate the hidden dangers. Although the Soviet Union resolves all disputes in its own way, the resolution of the Soviet-Romanian issue is clear evidence of this. In addition to congratulating the people of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina, the Soviet working masses express their support for the wise and peaceful Stalin policy, for without such wise guidance, there would be no such good results."

<h3>German Troops Take a Short Break, Preparing for a Large-Scale Attack on Britain, Commander of French Forces in the Near East Surrenders, London Feels Disappointed</h3>
<p>Rome: Italian newspapers indicated yesterday that, although the situation in the Balkans is urgent, direct military action by the Axis powers against Britain is inevitable. Evening newspapers claimed that German policy is to take the shortest possible break between two decisive battles, and Germany is determined to fight a major battle with British forces soon. "We are now going through a preparation period. If the German High Command continues to adhere to the policy of taking the shortest possible break during consecutive battles, then a large-scale attack on Britain is not far off. The current battle has reached its peak." "The Literary Newspaper stated that it is difficult to be sure where and how Germany will attack Britain, but those along the English Channel firmly believe that an attack is inevitable. After France's surrender, Britain can no longer import iron ore, iron soil, and French military industrial products, while Germany, in addition to looting other spoils of war, has tens of millions of liters of volatile and flammable liquids." The Fascist newspaper declared, "Germany and Italy are determined to force British forces to fight immediately." (United Press Telegram, 30th)</p>

<h3>The United States' Attitude Towards the Far East Will Not Change, Believing Arita's Speech Was Intended for Domestic Consumption, American Interests in the Dutch East Indies Cannot Be Ignored</h3>
<p>Washington: It appears that the United States does not agree with the Monroe Doctrine for the Far East announced by Japanese Foreign Minister Arita. The US government has consistently opposed Japan's plan for a New Order in East Asia. Officials here stated today that, no matter what happens in the world, this attitude of the United States will not change. (Reuters Telegram, 30th)</p>
<p>Washington: The White House and the State Department refused to comment last night on the "Monroe Doctrine" announced by Japanese Foreign Minister Arita in Tokyo yesterday. However, unofficial sources said that they believed the speech would be received coldly here. Sources here said that Washington officials would not make a formal response, as the speech was intended for the general public in Japan, not for representatives of foreign governments. Non-political figures believe that the wording of the speech is still relatively moderate. However, they see that from the broad tone, Japan reserves the necessary unlimited actions to be taken in the Far East. There is also a new discovery in this speech, namely that Japan includes the East Indies in its mission of stability. Sources here pointed out that the United States has huge commercial interests in the Dutch East Indies, which cannot be ignored. Non-political circles believe that Japan has no immediate intention of encroaching on American interests. However, once its own interests are violated under Arita's policy, the United States will inevitably be affected, either directly or indirectly. Semi-official sources deny that Arita's policy is similar to the Pan-American policy. They claim that the United States' policy towards the Western Hemisphere is to avoid interfering in the internal affairs of other American countries, while sharing responsibilities with all countries on the principle of equality, just as it previously took action in the Far East based on the Nine-Power Treaty.

<p>Chongqing Provisional Assembly Issues Circular Telegram</p>
<p>Chongqing – The Chongqing Provisional Assembly has issued a circular telegram regarding the atrocities committed by Japanese aircraft. It states that the Japanese warlords, relying on their military force, have dispatched large numbers of air force units to attack our rear cities. In the past two months, Japanese aircraft have attacked Chongqing more than nineteen times, causing the tragic sacrifice of our innocent citizens. Cultural institutions, such as schools, newspapers, and churches, have been devastated. Foreign embassies, such as the British, Soviet, German, and French embassies and consulates, foreign news agencies, such as TASS, Reuter, and Havas, and the lives and properties of other foreign nationals have been systematically destroyed by Japanese aircraft. The aim of the Japanese is to destroy our will to resist and to threaten diplomatic officials of third countries and their nationals, preventing them from residing in China, thereby realizing the Japanese dream of dominating East Asia. We must solemnly declare to the Japanese warlords that this attempt will absolutely fail. The citizens of Chongqing are enraged by the cruel atrocities of Japanese aircraft. This kind of brutal bombing will only arouse historical hatred that we will never be able to resolve. Our 700,000 citizens of Chongqing have long been prepared to accept Japanese bombing with the most tragic and solemn spirit. We firmly believe that the Japanese warlords will sooner or later have to repay the blood debt they owe. We will each stand firm in our positions, do our best to support the government's policy of prolonged resistance until final victory. We hope that our compatriots throughout the country will strive to this end, and that international friends will take effective action to assist our country. (Dispatch of the 30th)</p>

<p>Italian Troops Adopt Guerrilla Tactics Against the British</p>
<p>Rome – Albert, special correspondent for "Naples Newspaper," reported yesterday that Italian troops along the Libyan-Egyptian border are currently engaged in guerrilla warfare in the region to resist British forces. The correspondent stated that Italian infantry are hidden in trenches, waiting for British tanks to enter an encirclement of heavy artillery, at which point the artillery opens fire from all directions. The Italian troops are now engaged in heroic guerrilla tactics, hoping to thwart the advance of superior British motorized forces. On the reporter's first day in the war zone, he saw many Italian troops exposed while defending their positions, but now they are lying in wait underground for the arrival of British forces. They are hidden in trenches around the battlefield, forming a semi-circular encirclement. Once the British armored vehicles or tanks approach, the Italian troops lying in wait open fire from all directions. The Italian tactics have resulted in the capture of many British soldiers, including a British lord. (United Press dispatch, 30th)</p>

<h3>French Army's Defeat Result of Strategic Errors; 900,000 Captured in Battles Within France</h3>
<p>London – Professor Soulaire, Director of the French Academy, recently stated in London that he had asked General de Gaulle, head of the French National Committee in London, to explain the reasons for France's defeat. According to General de Gaulle, the French army was defeated without being able to fight. It is estimated that only 30,000 French soldiers were killed, with approximately 300,000 wounded. Initially, 350,000 French soldiers were captured within France, followed by an additional 600,000. In short, the French army did not fight. This was not due to a lack of courage and determination, but because the French command attempted to use the methods of 1914 to fight against the new German strategy of 1940. A major lesson from the fighting in France is that civilians should not interfere with military operations. If the British public obeys the instructions of the authorities, regardless of what they see or hear, and remain indoors, the actual losses of civilians will be minimal, and the damage caused by enemy mechanized equipment will not be so great.

<h3>Japanese Army Plots to Spy on Vietnam; Japanese Warships Gathered on the Coast of Fangcheng; Cargo Transportation in Vietnamese Ports Suddenly Interrupted</h3>
<p>Hong Kong Correspondence: It has recently been repeatedly reported here that Japan is taking advantage of the turbulent situation in Europe to plot to spy on Vietnam. This is supported by reports from southern Guangdong and the Shantou-Amoy region regarding the movements of Japanese troops, which are also highly credible. However, it is difficult to predict whether the Japanese will succeed in their scheme. It is reported that along the coast of the islands of Qiongyai and Runzhou, and in the Gulf of Tonkin, before late May, the Japanese fleet had only one aircraft carrier and over twenty warships of various sizes, all belonging to the 11th Fleet.</p>
<p>Sudden Increase in Japanese Warships</p>
<p>Since early June, the number of Japanese warships has increased dramatically, reaching over ninety. They are distributed from the waters off Fangcheng to the southeast of Qiongyai Island. All of Duzhouling, Nanrongling, Sanzhou Island, Dongluo Island, and Xigu Island have been occupied, and large quantities of military supplies have been transported and stored in the ports and bays of Yulin, Sanya, Qinglan, and Yangpu. At the same time, Japanese boats are conducting construction, dredging, and other work in these ports and bays. Submarines have entered Yulin Port. As for the Japanese troops gathered on Qiongyai Island, their numbers have also been increasing, reaching over 30,000. Apart from a small force dealing with the local Chinese guerrilla units, most are engaged in training in mountain climbing tactics and practicing balloon ascensions. The Supreme Commander of the Japanese Army, Nishio Toshizo, arrived in Qiongyai on the 11th to inspect and give instructions on important facilities such as the expansion of airfields, military ports, and warehouses. This clearly shows that they are using Qiongyai Island as a military base and implementing their southward policy with Vietnam as their target.</p>
<p>Attempt to Invade</p>
<p>On the 16th, Japanese warships off the coast of Fangcheng loaded Japanese soldiers and concentrated on Maiwei Island, attempting to directly invade Dongxing along the Jiangping Market. However, they were met with a calm and resolute defense by the Chinese troops stationed there, preventing the Japanese from succeeding. On the 17th, another Japanese warship sailed to Bailongwei, attacking the Chinese troops, but was again repelled. Dongxing and Bailongwei are both located very close to Vietnam. The Japanese actions undoubtedly threaten Vietnam. Therefore, the Vietnamese authorities are closely monitoring the situation. Vietnamese troops have also gathered in the border town of Jietie in preparation. Furthermore, the Japanese troops in Qincheng, who increased by over ten thousand a month ago and were originally preparing to attack eastwards, flanking the Chinese forces on the West River Line, have now been withdrawn to the islands of Qiongyai and Runzhou, also in preparation for spying on Vietnam.</p>
<p>Transportation Between Ports and Vietnam</p>
<p>Amidst the Japanese spying on Vietnam, the French government suddenly accepted the Japanese demand that Chinese and foreign goods not be transported through Haiphong and Hanoi. The Vietnamese authorities then decided to comply strictly from the 20th, which directly affected the transportation industry between Vietnamese and Hong Kong ports, causing it to come to a standstill. After the outbreak of the Guangdong-Guangxi war, the export routes for Chinese products such as tung oil, silk, and bristles were mostly through the Yunnan-Vietnam railway to Vietnam, then transferred to Hong Kong for centralized export. European and American goods and Hong Kong products were also mostly transported to the mainland via Hong Kong and Vietnam. Therefore, Vietnam had become an important channel for the import and export of Chinese and foreign goods, and the volume of freight was very large. Due to the suspension of transportation, the losses to various transportation companies are very significant. Among them, goods worth over two million Hong Kong dollars are stockpiled in Hong Kong awaiting transportation to the mainland. Goods stored in Vietnam that cannot be transported to Hong Kong are also similarly affected. Furthermore, Hong Kong's required food supplies, such as livestock, rice, and stone, have also relied on supplies from Vietnam and Kangzhou Bay, which are now in danger of being interrupted, causing prices to rise. As for ships sailing from Hong Kong to Vietnam, those belonging to British merchants are still operating as usual, while those belonging to French merchants have been completely suspended since the 22nd, presumably due to compliance with Japanese demands on France. Passengers traveling to Vietnam on that day who had already boarded French merchant ships were temporarily transferred to British merchant ships. Therefore, while cargo transportation between Hong Kong and Vietnam has been suspended, passenger traffic can still continue, relying only on the limited connections of a few British merchant ships.</p>
<h3>Fierce Battles in Northern Guangdong: Chinese Troops Recapture Conghua, Japanese Troops Retreat to Xinjie</h3>
<p>Hong Kong dispatch: The war in northern Guangdong Province, which had been dormant for a long time, continued until mid-May. The Japanese army then successively gathered troops stationed in the Huaxian and Conghua areas, hoping to invade the Bajiang River. From May 21st to 25th, fierce battles occurred at Fenghuo Ridge northwest of Liang Kou. Battles also occurred at Shiling, Zhizhai, Tianxin Village, Jingkou, and other places along the Bajiang River. On the 27th, the Japanese army again used twelve aircraft as cover to break through the Chinese army's Shijing position. However, after a counterattack by the Chinese army, they were repelled and a batch of Japanese soldiers were captured and sent to northern Guangdong for custody. Since the beginning of this month, the war in that area has become increasingly fierce. On the morning of the 5th, the Chinese army captured Heishan and Jiekou in separate attacks. The Japanese army rushed to reinforce them from Hemu Jing and Shendao, totaling more than 3,000 men. Their unit number was the Matsuo Regiment. They encountered the Chinese army at noon on the 7th, and the Japanese suffered heavy casualties.</p>
<p>Recapture of Conghua: On the morning of the 8th, the Japanese army in various parts of Conghua increased to 4,000 men. Using aircraft and artillery cover, they launched a three-pronged counterattack against the Chinese army with fierce momentum. The Chinese army retreated slightly to the north along the entire front, but continued to fight a back-and-forth battle in the Jilonggang area. On the 9th, the Chinese army finally recovered Jilonggang. More than 500 Japanese corpses were found in the area south of Jilonggang, including three Japanese officers: Major Miyazawa, battalion commander, and Lieutenants Fujishima and Ito. Since then, the Chinese army has advanced rapidly towards Conghua County. On the 12th, the father (referring to a military leader) recaptured the county seat, taking advantage of the Japanese army's exhaustion, and attacked the outskirts of Guangzhou. However, the main forces of both sides are still in the Shendao and Taipingchang areas.</p>
<p>Recapture of Longkou</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the 7th, the Japanese army in Huaxian, with more than 500 men, advanced from Longkou towards Pingshan. A certain unit of the Chinese army retreated slightly, luring the Japanese army deep into the area north of Pingshan. The Japanese army fell into their trap. The Chinese army then used a surprise force to cut off their retreat. The Japanese suffered heavy casualties, and the Chinese army recaptured Longkou, reaching Shijiao directly. On the 9th, the two armies charged and fought each other fiercely at Shijiao. The Japanese army was defeated and retreated to Xinjie Sanyangdian and other places. The Chinese army has brought the Xinjie area under control. On the evening of the 13th, a certain unit of the Chinese army again attacked Longxiang in two directions, attacking into the market from the northwest suburbs. They engaged in repeated hand-to-hand combat with the Japanese army, killing more than 100 Japanese soldiers. The Japanese troops in Renhe and Yahu heard the news and rushed to reinforce, but the Chinese soldiers were not discouraged and continued to attack. On the 14th, the two sides were still in a stalemate in the suburbs of Longxiang.</p>
<p>Unrest in Guangzhou</p>
<p>Since the Chinese army in northern Guangdong recaptured Conghua County, the outskirts of Guangzhou have been threatened. Therefore, the Japanese army has reinforced its troops in Xicun, Baiyun, Sanyuanli, Henan Baogang, Simintu Factory, and other places on the outskirts of the city.哨 Posts have also been added to all major intersections, and armored vehicles patrol all roads at night. After 7 pm every night, pedestrians are prohibited from traveling. Japanese military police and puppet police search all inns and hotels every night, and the situation is extremely serious.</p>
<h3>European Radio Broadcasting War</h3>
<p>Germans broadcast to England five times more than the BBC's propaganda to Germany each day, but the English are on target every time. The fact that any German is willing to sacrifice to listen to English broadcasts shows the maturity of the anti-Nazi movement. Regardless of the severity of the penalties - those who listen to foreign broadcasts face years in prison, and repeat offenders can be sentenced to death - the German people are willing to endure it. They use one radio to broadcast German programs loudly, while another is hidden to secretly receive foreign radio broadcasts.</p>
<p>The British Broadcasting Corporation often stimulates the Germans by telling them that they cannot listen to foreign broadcasts. "Himmler (head of the German political police) tells you that listening to foreign broadcasts will damage your nerves. In fact, Germans, what he fears is not your nerves, but your thoughts. You are being deceived. We in England can listen to German broadcasts freely, even if the police are standing outside the window."</p>
<p>British broadcasts to Germany have always been factual, striving to win the trust of the Germans with accuracy. They often start by playing a few sad songs from German military music, and then read out the names of the German prisoners recently captured from the army, navy and air force. This is extremely attractive to listeners, because Germany never announces such news at home. A woman in East Prussia received official notification that her son had died in a submarine accident. A memorial service was held regularly in the village church. The British radio station broadcast the boy's name, saying that he was still alive. A grocery merchant in the town secretly told the boy's mother the good news. Four other friends of the woman also risked their lives to inform her of the same message. The memorial service was held as scheduled, but afterwards there was a private banquet.</p>
<p>Broadcasts about food shortages are most upsetting to housewives. Sometimes British broadcasters have a "housewives' program," and matter-of-factly give a cooking method, saying "four chicken eggs, a quarter of a pound of butter, and two tablespoons of sugar." German wives can't help but ask themselves. The British also often rebroadcast programs from the "Free Germany" radio station, which is located in Germany and transported from place to place by truck. Radio engineers say that such a station would require five or six trucks to transport the equipment, and most of these stations broadcast on the French border. No matter where it is located, the Germans always consider this a headache.</p>
<p>The situation of French broadcasts to Germany is similar to that of Britain - often quoting Hitler's speeches and adding annotations, attacking him even harder where he has broken his promises. A French broadcaster said: "Hitler insists that he wants to save Europe from communism, but now he has thrown himself into Stalin's arms. Listen to what he says on page 346 of 'Mein Kampf'." The German director of broadcasts to England is Jiaertanbai, an Iwowan, who participated in the European War in 1918. He went to Germany four years ago, married a German woman, and joined the German propaganda machine. His propaganda is nothing more than boasting about Germany's military power and trying to divide Britain and the United States, but its momentum is not particularly fierce. The Germans often use radio broadcasting internally as a tool to inspire the people, using every possible means to stimulate German hatred of England. When an accident occurs in Germany, there must always be the following words: "A suspect with a British accent was found at the scene. The police department is currently investigating." The Germans broadcast reports from the front line to the public every day. As soon as a German plane returns from reconnaissance on the front line, or flies back from bombing the enemy, it borrows a pocket-sized speaker to broadcast to the public. Submarine captains also stick their heads out of the command tower to describe the scene of enemy ships being sunk. Germans who have worked in journalism receive special training in Potsdam and then come out to organize German "propaganda companies" to engage in the various broadcasts mentioned above. Their programs are very rich, and German families flock to them.</p>
<p>What is strange is that although countries are engaged in their own propaganda, carrying out a radio broadcasting war, none of them interfere with the other's radio waves in the air, making it impossible to broadcast at all. Perhaps the result of disrupting radio waves will inevitably deepen hatred, and both sides believe that radio broadcasting is a powerful weapon for both attack and defense.

<h3>Charity Basketball United Cup Yesterday's Game: Shanghai Qing Fought Hard to Defeat Qunyi; Qunyi Showed Strength and Led in the First Half, Shanghai Qing Took the Lead in the Last Ten Minutes</h3>
<p>The United Cup Charity Basketball game was the second day yesterday. The two Group A2 games were tense throughout. In the first game between Shangxing and Zhongyi, Shangxing was initially at a disadvantage, but later took the lead with 14-9 in the first half, and then won 31-25. In the second game between Xihua and Tongren, the strength was slightly different. Qiu Xiaoci and Gao Zhaolong of Xihua scored 41 points in total, causing Tongren to be controlled throughout, and they lost miserably with 40-63. Xihua also led in the first half with 33-16. The final game between Qunyi and Shanghai Qing was tense every second. Under great threat, Shanghai Qing reversed the defeat in the last ten minutes. The United Cup trophy silver cups for the two groups are on display at the Xiexing Sports Equipment Company's business department at No. 1000 Edward Road starting yesterday. The battle between Shanghai Qing and Qunyi is as follows:</p>
<p>Qunyi Takes the Lead</p>
<p>Qunyi is a transformed version of Xufang. Shen Yugong, Chen Xuechong, Ren Xiangcheng and others, who were pillars of the former Hualian team, have all joined Shanghai Qing. Yesterday, Qunyi continued Xufang's style and momentum was undiminished. Tao Shaosheng opened the scoring first. Before long, He Xiaoguang hit the bullseye. Shanghai Qing buried itself in hard work. Li Zude and Shen Yugong each scored 4 points, and then each scored 6 points. Qunyi, seeing the urgent situation, transferred Yan Yong and brought in Qiao Liulang, and the momentum greatly increased. Tao Shaosheng and Zou Zichen hit every shot, and the momentum increased by seven points in one breath, creating the most excellent situation of 15-7, 18-10, and 20-12. This was Qunyi's golden age. After that, the two sides were evenly matched, and Qunyi was always in the leading position. Da Mao on Shanghai Qing's side withdrew once and re-entered, but failed to break through Qunyi's fire net. 32-29, Shanghai Qing was at a disadvantage in the first half.</p>
<p>Shanghai Qing Turns the Tide</p>
<p>After the change of baskets, Qunyi's momentum continued to rise. He Xiaoguang fired like a machine gun, hitting the bullseye. Yu Dehai and Shen Yugong scored two consecutive points, still maintaining a balance. When Shen Yugong scored a point, chasing the score to a close situation of 36-37, Chen Xuechong was sent off for four fouls, and the audience was worried for Shanghai Qing. Unexpectedly, after Li Zude was transferred to the court, he immediately scored a basket, creating the third chance for Shanghai Qing to take the lead. However, Qunyi immediately chased to a tie, from 39 each to 40 each. The balance between the two sides was not broken. Unfortunately, Qunyi's stamina was insufficient, while Shanghai Qing became more and more brave. Da Mao and Yu Dehai scored nine points in a row, allowing Shanghai Qing to escape the dangerous situation and reach 48-40. In the last seven minutes, Tao Shaosheng was sent off for four fouls, giving Qunyi an even greater blow. Shanghai Qing finally reversed the defeat with 56-48.</p>

<h3>The Eastern Football Team's Great Victory Over the Malaysian Chinese Combined Team in Singapore</h3>

<p>(Singapore Dispatch) The Hong Kong Eastern Football Team played a charity match against the Malaysian Chinese Combined Team at the Anson Road Stadium here on the 14th. Eastern won with a score of four to one. The proceeds from ticket sales were entirely donated to the British War Relief Fund. Due to inclement weather, the audience was small. In the first half, Eastern led two to one, with Hou Chengtuo and Li Deqi each scoring a goal. Tai Sheng, the center forward of the Malaysian Chinese team, seized the opportunity of a penalty kick and broke the egg. In the second half, the Malaysian Chinese Combined Team only had ten players on the field, making offense and defense difficult. Eastern took the opportunity to advance, with Li Deqi and Xu Jingcheng successively scoring goals, ending the game with a score of four to one.</p>

<h3>Increased Levies in the Two French Concessions Today Make Life in Shanghai More Difficult, Inevitably Affecting Commodity Prices and Rents. The French Concession Taxpayers' Association Asks for Reconsideration.</h3>
<p>The Public Concession Bureau of Works is increasing levies by 50%, meaning that house taxes, land taxes, license fees, and all other payable fees will be subject to an additional surcharge of 50%. The French Concession Board of Directors is increasing levies, with the land tax surcharge increasing from one per thousand to three per thousand, and the house tax surcharge increasing from two percent to seven percent. The surcharges on other certificate taxes and miscellaneous taxes are all increasing from ten percent to fifty percent. The above-mentioned increased levies in both concessions will be implemented as scheduled from today. The burden on taxpayers in both concessions will inevitably increase, and the possible consequences will be to stimulate commodity prices and fuel rent increase disputes.</p>
<p>A Letter Asking the French Authorities to Reconsider</p>
<p>The French Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association, regarding the increase in levies, wrote to the Board of Directors, but the Board of Directors rejected the request in its reply. Yesterday, they sent another letter to the Board of Directors to argue on principle, asking the Superintendent of the Board, Mr. Bietry, and the Director-General, Mr. Teghidi, to reconsider. The original letter stated: "Respectfully, we have received your letter of June 28th and are fully aware of its contents. Regarding the upcoming increase in levy rates, our association has already thoroughly discussed it and has not mentioned a 40% increase in levies. It only stated that the increase rate for various taxes is as high as 40%, such as vehicle licenses. Our association needs to clarify this point. After the outbreak of the war in 1937, the number of residents in the French Concession suddenly increased,</p>
<p>The City Scene is Flourishing</p>
<p>Although your board's various expenditures and operating expenses have increased, empty houses that were previously unoccupied have been swept away, and the construction of houses on vacant land has sprung up like mushrooms. The income from house taxes has also increased accordingly. Therefore, although your board's expenditures have increased, its income has also increased. However, please examine the number of residents in the French Concession after 1939, which has shown a gradual decline. The reasons are nothing more than high commodity prices and difficult living conditions, and the indirect reason is the large amount of taxes levied by your board, which also has a</p>
<p>Significant Relationship</p>
<p>Because the surcharges on various taxes after the war are quite large. The rise and fall of any region is based on the increase or decrease of residents. If your board intends to maintain the current prosperity, it should not reduce the number of residents. Therefore, the increase in taxes is a serious blow. As for the economic foundation of your board,</p>
<p>Always Solid</p>
<p>According to economic principles, we should live within our means and balance income and expenditure. Therefore, each fiscal budget is necessary, but we dare to ask your board not to be too meticulous about this, because according to previous financial statements, there is a surplus every year, and this surplus can also make up for the deficit. Moreover, the recent withdrawal of the French Concession refugee area police force can save a lot of expenses. In short, the people are the most important, and the country is second. The prosperity and decline of the entire region are closely related to the safety and security of the people's livelihood and are in the hands of the administrators of this region. They are interdependent, interrelated, and mutually dependent. Therefore, regarding the issue of this increase in levies, we ask your board to reconsider it, and if it can be suspended, or the increase rate reduced, or the implementation postponed, the millions of residents of our French Concession will be extremely anxious and hopeful. We hereby send this letter and ask for your review and reply." This is addressed to the French Concession Board of Directors.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Raises Money for Winter Clothing Allowances</h3>
<p>The Solicitation of慰勞金 (consolation money) 代金 Committee, hosted by a certain group in this city, has already begun to prepare for the Shanghai winter clothing allowance campaign in advance, as instructed. The dates and solicitation regulations are generally in accordance with the National Winter Clothing Solicitation Association. For the sake of unified centralization, this city's winter clothing allowance solicitation this year will be promoted by the Solicitation慰勞金 代金 Campaign Committee. It is heard that the Solicitation Association is preparing, and its solicitation regulations will be announced soon. The association will provide receipt books, bank remittance slips, and donation reporting forms to various industry groups, schools, and institutions before the solicitation date, so that all sectors can carry out the solicitation. The funds raised will be collected and remitted to the National Bank by the presiding groups to express the respect of the Shanghai people and to fulfill the inherent mission of the people. It is said that the Solicitation Association has sent a telegram to the Chongqing Winter Clothing Solicitation Association to acknowledge the amount and respond.</p>
<h3>It Was Reported Yesterday That the Iron Gate of the Sixteenth Wharf Would Be Open All Day</h3>
<p>The iron gate connecting the French Concession and the Nanshi area has seen few residents entering and exiting since it was opened on the 28th of last month. Yesterday, it was reported that the iron gate would be open all day starting today. The previous opening hours, which were only limited to 7:00 AM to 11:00 AM, were said to be a trial run.</p>
<h3>Inheritance Tax Will Be Levied Today, Handled Concurrently by the Direct Tax Office. The Shanghai Concession Area is No Exception.</h3>
<p>Property Value</p>
<p>After the Ministry of Finance established the Direct Tax Office, it will implement the levying of inheritance tax starting today. Provisional regulations and implementation rules have been promulgated one after another, stipulating that anyone who leaves property in the territory of the Republic of China at the time of death shall pay inheritance tax according to law. Citizens of the Republic of China who have a residence in the country and have property abroad shall also be taxed. Inheritance is the movable and immovable property of the deceased, as well as all other rights to it. Inheritance tax is calculated and levied based on the amount of inheritance, and the heirs and legatees are the taxpayers. Inheritances with a total value of less than 5,000 yuan, as well as property donated to the government, property donated to educational, cultural, charitable, and public welfare undertakings, and property not exceeding 500,000 yuan, are exempt from inheritance tax. If the land in the inheritance is continuously cultivated by the heir, the amount of inheritance tax to be borne by the land portion shall be</p>
<p>Halved</p>
<p>Inheritances with a total value of more than 5,000 yuan shall be subject to a tax of 1%. Those exceeding 50,000 yuan shall be subject to an additional tax calculated by grade on the amount exceeding it. Those who fail to report the fact of death or submit an inventory of inheritance may be fined up to 50 yuan. Those who intend to reduce or exempt tax amounts and conceal inheritance shall be subject to a fine of one to three times the amount of tax concealed in addition to the supplementary tax amount. Today, the people of the country regard this tax as China's only good direct tax,</p>
<p>Unanimously Support</p>
<p>And comply with it, and the Shanghai Concession area is no exception. Furthermore, the excess profits tax has been levied since January 1st of last year, and the rumor that it will be implemented at the same time as the inheritance tax is inaccurate.</p>
<h3>National Day Celebrations in the United States and Canada: Celebration Programs. Today is Canada's Restoration of National Sovereignty Memorial Day. The Fourth is the United States Independence Day.</h3>
<p>The fourth of this month is the 151st anniversary of American independence. The American侨 in Shanghai will, as usual, hold enthusiastic celebrations on this day. The U.S. Navy's 4th Regiment in Shanghai is scheduled to hold a flag-raising ceremony at 8:30 AM on this morning, presided over by Colonel Baker at the Columbia Country Club on Great Western Road, and hold a review. U.S. Acting Consul Baker, Justice Hemmerich, and Mr. Macronlai will all attend and participate. The flag-raising ceremony will take about three quarters of an hour. The American Club will host guests from 12:30 PM to 2:00 PM. At 3:00 PM, the 4th Regiment will perform a baseball game at the racecourse, inviting Mr. Hongbai, the commander of the International Volunteer Corps, as the referee, and Mr. Fankeling, the former Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Public Works Bureau, and Mr. Aleman, the current director of the Board of Directors of the Public Works Bureau, as the line judges. At 9:00 PM in the evening, a "July 4th" dinner party will be held at the Columbia Country Club.</p>
<p>Today is the 73rd anniversary of Canada's restoration of national sovereignty. The Canadian僑 and club members in this city are scheduled to hold a dinner party at the Royal Air Force Association clubhouse in the HSBC Building tonight to celebrate. According to a New Sound News reporter, the association has sent invitations to Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, the British Ambassador to China.</p>
<p>U.S. Acting Consul General in Shanghai, Baker, British Consul General in Shanghai, Sir George, and senior British and American naval and land officers in Shanghai will attend to extend their congratulations. At a time when the whole country is rising up to assist Britain in the war, the commemoration is all the more meaningful. According to the 1st of July 1867, the territories of the British North American Federation were restored to the Canadian territory.</p>
<h3>Vietnam Detains Indigo Blue Cloth, Consulting on the Situation. The French Embassy in Chongqing Has Sent a Telegram to Shanghai.</h3>
<p>Since the Vietnamese government implemented the detention of domestically produced indigo blue cloth shipped to the mainland by various manufacturers in this city via transit through that place, the merchants of this city once stated that although the indigo blue trademark was registered in Germany, the raw materials of the cloth were purely domestically produced, spun, woven, and dyed. Now that it has been detained suddenly, it is obviously due to a misunderstanding. Therefore, they telegraphed the Ministry of Economic Affairs and requested the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to make representations to the French Embassy in China and explain everything. On the local side, they wrote to the French Consul General in Shanghai, requesting that he release the detained cloth as soon as possible in accordance with the instructions of the Vietnamese government in order to maintain the established good relations between the two countries and facilitate commercial transportation. It is heard that the French Embassy in Chongqing has sent a telegram to Shanghai, instructing the consulate to convene relevant parties to engage in consultations in order to handle the matter accordingly. After receiving this telegram, the French Consulate General in Shanghai has formally notified the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, instructing the industry association to promptly send representatives of the member manufacturers who have been detained to the consulate along with representatives of the Chamber of Commerce to await consultation. It is heard that the representatives have been appointed by the industry.</p>
<h3>The Transfer of Documents to the French is Groundless. The Chinese Side Lodges a Serious Protest. It is Legal to Return Them to the Chinese Government. The British and American Authorities Should Consider Carefully.</h3>
<p>After the Shanghai Municipal Government deposited the Land Bureau documents with the Bureau of Works, the pseudo "Municipal Government" repeatedly requested them from the Bureau of Works. This issue was considered by the Bureau of Works and the Consular Body. According to a Pirmins News reporter, some opinions within the Consular Body seemed to favor the pseudo government's request for the deposited documents. However, the Chinese side unanimously opposed it and has lodged protests with the British and American authorities, urging them to pay attention. The legal basis for this case is that the pseudo organization has not been recognized by any country, so it cannot be handed over rashly. Moreover, these documents were entrusted to it for safekeeping by the Chinese government and should be returned to the Chinese government in the future, which is legal. The British and American authorities are now reconsidering it carefully.</p>
<p>Serious Breach of Faith is No Different from Surrender</p>
<p>The宇林西報 (North China Daily News) carried a letter from a reader, Mr. Sun, stating that your newspaper recently published an editorial entitled "An Important Issue," which advocated that the Chinese Land Bureau archives, which Mayor Yu Hongjun had previously deposited with the Bureau of Works, be transferred to Fu Xiao'an. After reading it,</p>
<p>I am deeply shocked</p>
<p>The editorial said, "In the past year and three seasons, the degree of improvement in the situation has reached the point where it is irrefutable and it can be safely said that the situation has returned to normal in expectations." I wonder if other Chinese and foreign people hold this view. The Bureau of Works accepted the documents on behalf of the Chinese government and</p>
<p>Kept them safe</p>
<p>If these documents are handed over to any party other than the legitimate Chinese government, it would be a serious breach of faith. The British people strongly criticized the surrender of the British allies, which would greatly affect British interests. If the Bureau of Works handed over the documents to Fu Xiao'an, it would be no different from a small-scale surrender, but its meanness would be no different from surrender. At this time, it is not only the Chinese people who hope that their British friends have learned the painful lesson that compromise is useless.</p>
<h3>Chinese Mobile Troops Have Reached Kunshan. Around 1:00 PM the Day Before Yesterday, the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway Was Interrupted.</h3>
<p>The Chinese mobile troops led by 禰 are very active along the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway line. In addition to attacking Danyang Station and blowing up a Japanese military vehicle a few days ago, according to passengers on the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway who arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning, around 1:00 PM the day before yesterday (the 29th), the railway tracks on the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway near Wuxi were again dug up in many sections by Chinese mobile troops, causing traffic on the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway to be interrupted again. However, the details are unknown because passengers were unable to inquire. After the Japanese side repaired it, it was able to pass. It is also learned that the Chinese mobile troops have gradually extended to the suburbs of Shanghai, and their vanguard troops have reportedly crossed the Qingyang Port and reached the Kunshan area.</p>
<h3>The Closure of the Nanshi Refugee Area Leaves a Deep Impression</h3>
<p>The procedures for disbanding the Nanshi Refugee Area have been completed. The disbursement of relief grain for the 19,000 people in the area was completed yesterday. The General Office of the Supervisory Committee of the area also announced its dissolution with the end of the area affairs. Except for the two hospitals and the Xin Pu Yu Tang in the area, which will be temporarily maintained by the Rehabilitation Committee, all 88 shelters were declared closed yesterday. The refugees in the area usually received grain rations from the area office according to the number of people, with each person receiving half a pound of rice per day. Because most of them were engaged in peddling and working, they were able to make a living. Now that they have suddenly lost their relief grain, the future is difficult. At the same time, there are also problems with their residences, because the private owners of the shelter houses will take the opportunity to close the refugee area and take them back. The Nanshi Refugee Area was established during the most tense time of the Battle of Shanghai on August 13th. At that time, the war zone in the suburbs of Shanghai was full of refugees. Without the establishment of this area, the suffering of the people would have been even more tragic. The official establishment date of the area was November 11th, 1937, and it was declared closed yesterday (June 30th) due to the departure of the Father, lasting two years, seven months, and nineteen days, leaving a deep impression on people.</p>
<h3>French僑 Receive Slogan Letters, Filled with Grief and Indignation. Old Travels Have Become a Thing of the Past. How Can They Relieve Sorrow and Boredom?</h3>
<p>The French-language Shanghai Daily News said that the French侨 in this city received letters from France at the end of May the day before yesterday. Their envelopes were all stamped with slogan propaganda, including slogans such as "Victory is still after long-term patience" and "The old houses and museums of a certain city (now occupied) are worth visiting." The French侨, after receiving the letters, sighed at the past and present, all filled with grief and indignation, because things have changed, and in no time, they have become a thing of the past, which makes people linger even more. According to the French newspaper, the French侨 in this city now only have to work hard to revitalize the morale of the people, because although work is not enough to forget worries, it can also relax the tense nerves slightly and give the broken heart something to rely on, so as not to hurt the spirit. The newspaper believes that any work should be beneficial to the public and provide comfort to itself.</p>
<h3>The Grain Industry Conference Ends, Forming an Evaluation Committee</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Soy and Rice Industry Association, together with the Miscellaneous Grain, Oil Cake Industry Association, consulted the day before yesterday on concrete measures to stabilize the rice market. After discussion, in accordance with the wishes of the authorities, they organized the Shanghai Rice Industry Group Food Evaluation Committee to be responsible for handling rice price evaluation matters. Now, the association has appointed Zhu Youzhang, Cao Xinggeng, and Yan Xiaoquan to visit the authorities again at 10:00 AM today to report on the deliberations of the industry and the need to organize a food evaluation committee at present. If the consent of the authorities is obtained, they will proceed with the matter, and it is expected that the authorities will urge its realization. The Hong Kong authorities have banned ship exports to disperse the population, but have not banned rice exports, so rice-laden ships may set sail to Shanghai in the coming days. It is also learned that 1,600 tons of rice were loaded in Hong Kong a few days ago and originally intended to be shipped to Shanghai for the market, but it was decided to transfer it to Ningbo midway, and a large quantity will arrive in early July, numbering more than 130,000 bags.</p>
<h3>Five Religions Lectures, Yesterday's Lecture on the Essentials of Christianity</h3>
<p>Yesterday (June 30th) was the second day of the five religions lectures held in commemoration of Mr. Feng Bingnan's mother's birthday. The lecture was on the essentials of Christianity in three parts, and the speaker was the famous Christian scholar Mr. Xu Songshi. On this day, the audience was still very enthusiastic, including both Christians and non-Christians. Mr. Xu had a deep understanding of Christian doctrine and expounded it very clearly. His views on the relationship between doctrine and filial piety were very insightful, and he also cited many examples of Confucius's thought, which showed that the purpose of religion was originally consistent. He said that Christianity emphasizes practice rather than theory, which is particularly able to extract the spirit of the church's founding and is thought-provoking. The joke about the confused worm at the end made the audience laugh. Therefore, the audience was full of energy from beginning to end. The broadcasting equipment was improved on this day, so the sound was clearer than the first day. Several fans were added in the hall, so the cool breeze was blowing. Today is the third day of the lecture, and the lecture will be on the essentials of Taoism and morality. Public lectures on Taoism are very rare, and it is expected that the audience will be even more enthusiastic. A book of Ancient Mirrors of Moral Education and Taoism introduction gift coupons will also be distributed on the spot, but it is a valuable crop.</p>
<h3>Jews in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— A Quan</p>
<p>If we occasionally step into the area north of the Suzhou River, turning from Beisichuan Road, 横浜桥(Yokohama Bridge) to the Zhoushan Road and Broadway Road area of the Huishan Police Station...for a round-trip tour, we will at least discover many lost sheep-like –Jews.</p>
<p>Since Germany ordered the expulsion of Jews a year ago, Jews have suddenly become "survivors of the tiger's mouth"; it makes them deeply feel that the vast earth has long been without a foothold for the exiled! Alas! May I ask, what path is left for the lambs whose lairs have been destroyed and are bewildered? Finally, they could not escape the butcher's bloody hands, and they were forced to this corner of the world, a Shanghai they never dreamed of.</p>
<p>For Jews in Shanghai, it can be said that the Hongkou area is the only lair for this group of lambs, right? All the houses in that area that were left empty after the war are filled with them!</p>
<p>Jews have always been known to the world for their "unique business acumen." When it comes to making a tenth of the profit, their methods are particularly "sharp." Therefore, some people describe their "business talent" as "calculating abacus" or "mercury on the ground"; it means that they "take advantage of every opportunity" and "leave no hole unfilled"; this saying is very subtle! Since the Jews came to Shanghai not long ago – even before Hongkou was opened – many Jews had already gathered in Hongkou to develop their "independent" or "group" economic network-style shops. What coffee shops, department stores, small dance halls, cinemas, barber shops, customs brokers, and even Jewish churches...are all opening up one after another! "Jews are cunning foxes," someone else said: "They always take the small opportunities in everything to easily take advantage of others; for example, if you accidentally borrow a match from a Jew to light a cigarette, he will also ask you for a cigarette in return for the match."</p>
<p>Jews do business, not only satisfied with simply attracting customers at the storefront; they also personally go to the offices of nearby foreign companies with many daily necessities to implement the "soliciting" doctrine, which is a bit mysterious, even barbers are asked for advice!</p>
<p>Jews in Shanghai seem to be living on the surface: but their inner worries and spiritual pain, I think, are too pitiful! If you don't believe me, let the author give two examples:</p>
<p>Although this happened last year, it still remains deeply in my mind. Once: when the × country's cruise ship arrived in Shanghai – it was during the period when Jews were exiled to Shanghai – thousands of Jewish refugees were载(carried) to this isolated island, supporting the old and carrying the young, very chaotic; seeing this "lamb wandering picture" involuntarily teaches you to feel the pain of "the country is broken and the family is destroyed." A Jew happened to come to my company to write借用(borrow) a phone, and he said to me in not very pure English: "Sir! Isn't it very interesting? This is all the family property I was lucky enough to bring from Germany!" As he spoke, he pointed to a small handheld leather夹(folder) with a bitter smile. He didn't cry, maybe he was still a philosopher? Cherishing the tears that are not easily shed, to cope with the more painful environment on the future lifeline!</p>
<p>Another time: the × country's cruise ship, in the pouring rain,又载(carried) the second batch of pitiful exiles. (Of course, they were Jewish refugees) But, outside the iron gate of the pier, there were many Jews who were 槟弃(rejected) outside the gate by the × country's customs officers, and no one was allowed to run in, although they all had sufficient reasons; they were only allowed to sigh at the ocean and be soaked in the pouring rain倒(Instead) Very coincidentally, a pair of洋狗(foreign dogs) were not stopped by the customs officers and were able to swagger越(past)进(and into) the iron fence. I witnessed this scene and was moved by emotion, and a feeling of sadness arose: "Alas! The pain of losing a country is worse than being a dog!"</p>

<h3>Hong Kong Tense: Chinese Residents Flee, Heading to Southwest and Manila, etc. Ships Leaving Hong Kong for Shanghai are Fully Loaded</h3>
<p>Since Hong Kong declared martial law due to threats, the situation has become extremely tense. The local government has ordered the evacuation of British women, children, and expatriates, to be completed by the 5th of this month. At the same time, it has convened overseas Chinese leaders to plan the evacuation. According to telegrams received by the shipping industry yesterday, Chinese residents in Hong Kong, feeling uneasy due to the tense situation, have been moving away from Hong Kong in droves in recent days. Currently, tickets for all ships leaving Hong Kong for Shanghai have been snapped up. However, most are taking advantage of the uninterrupted transportation between Hong Kong and Vietnam to evacuate with their families, heading to the southwestern provinces. Currently, in addition to regular ships and those calling at bays, the Hong Kong-Vietnam routes are served by the Guanghai and Haitan ships of Guangdong, which make special trips. Although the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway has not been interrupted, the evacuation of Chinese from Vietnam and Hong Kong and the urgent transport of accumulated goods have caused congestion. It is also learned that the President Coolidge of the United States President Lines was diverted to transport foreign women and children to Manila after returning to Hong Kong from Shanghai last week. Therefore, its originally scheduled return to Shanghai on the 9th of this month will be delayed for several days.</p>
<p>Dutch East Indies: Defense</p>
<p>The defense of the Dutch East Indies is now also very comprehensive. Currently, there are four infantry regiments and two independent battalions, as well as a tank corps, coastal defense force, and anti-aircraft artillery force. The naval strength includes two light cruisers, eight destroyers, twelve submarines, two gunboats, five mine-laying ships, and eight mine-sweeping ships. In addition, a naval air base has been established in Amboyna, West Ceram Island, making its strength extremely formidable.</p>
<p>British Commentary</p>
<p>Mr. Woodhead, a well-known British commentator in this city, published an article in yesterday's English "North China Daily News" weekly, commenting on the current tense relations between Britain and Japan. The article began by saying, "We can assume that the British government's warning to women and children in Hong Kong to prepare for evacuation is clearly due to the recent hostile actions taken by the Japanese army. Since landing near Kowloon, the Japanese army has completed the encirclement of the Kowloon border and implemented a blockade of Hong Kong. This action attempts to coerce the British government to stop using Hong Kong and the Burma Road to transport 'munitions' into mainland China."</p>
<p>"Legally speaking, the Japanese government has no right to make this request. According to the Japanese side, 'they are not at war with the Chinese National Government,' so Japan's request to enjoy belligerent rights is purely an overreach. The Japanese can certainly use force to prohibit goods from entering the mainland from occupied areas, but they have no reason to interfere with Hong Kong's trade and the transportation on the Burma Road. The Hong Kong government has formally denied that munitions are transported from Hong Kong to the mainland. Hong Kong is purely a distribution center, and in law and morality, it has no right to prevent the transportation of goods from all neutral countries to China. If the British government prohibits American trucks or gasoline from transiting Hong Kong to China, then the American authorities would naturally be angered at Britain. As for the Burma Road, it can only transport a few hundred tons into Yunnan each month. It is doubtful whether the road is capable of transporting artillery, tanks, and aircraft engines. At the same time, the road mainly serves as an export route. Britain and the United States need various local products from mainland China, and they have no choice but to rely on the road's transportation capacity to obtain them, even if they pay high freight rates." The article concluded by saying that the Hong Kong authorities' notification to women and children to evacuate shows that the British government is unwilling to accept the Japanese military's demands. It remains to be seen whether the United States will give Britain active and moral support, but in any case, the United States believes that if Britain allows the road to be blocked, it would be tantamount to selling out the Chinese government. Mr. Woodhead hopes that the British and Japanese authorities will not break down over this issue, but if the Japanese side is completely stubborn, a breakdown may be inevitable.</p>
<p>Hong Kong: Rumors Abound</p>
<p>According to people from Hong Kong, the tension in Hong Kong in recent days has been unprecedented. At the same time, rumors abound, and people are panicking. As a result, countless people are going to Macau, Manila, and the mainland. A few days ago, when a famous actor Xue Juexian was performing his masterpiece at a theater, it was suddenly rumored that a certain army had broken into the British territory of Kowloon and that war had begun. The audience was shocked and fled in panic, causing chaos. Later, it was learned that it was a rumor, but everyone had been thoroughly frightened. Another piece of news said that a certain group of ronin had hidden a large number of weapons in cabbages and smuggled them into Hong Kong. At first, customs officers did not notice, but then a customs officer casually picked up a cabbage and felt that it weighed more than usual. When he opened it, he found a pistol and bullets hidden inside. As a result, a large search was carried out, and the truth was revealed. Everyone believed that a certain group was planning to launch an attack inside and outside Hong Kong, with some kind of plot. The Hong Kong authorities, believing that this news should not be spread, immediately issued an order prohibiting newspapers from publishing it. Later, it was revealed by customs officers, and it became known to the public. Currently, local cultural figures are moving to the mainland and Macau in droves.</p>
<h3>Feng Bingnan's Commemorative Words for His Mother's Birthday (4): Advocating Simple Moral Standards to the Utmost, Holding Three Major Events to Commemorate His Mother's Birthday</h3>
<p>I dare not claim to be able to fully practice filial piety, but I deeply know that filial piety is the foundation of being a person, and I have never dared to neglect it. Now that my mother's seventieth birthday is approaching, I do not want to hold a celebration in the worldly, luxurious, and fleeting manner, but I want to use a more lasting method that benefits people's minds and bodies to commemorate it. I believe that a person's mind and body are equally important. The body should be healthy, and the health of the mind should be equally emphasized. Physical health can be obtained through science, but mental health is beyond the reach of science. Even physical health sometimes cannot be achieved by science, so in addition to scientific treatment, many human diseases need to be treated with spirit. The world only sees the tangible and dazzling effects of science, and the accurate signs that can be traced, and thinks that science is omnipotent. Although science has its abilities, it is not omnipotent. The world often thinks that science can create, but in fact, science has no creative ability, it only explains, combines, or improves existing things, and cannot be said to create. Strictly speaking, human beings do not have the ability to create. For example, radio can transmit sound across thousands of miles of space, and people may think that this is the achievement of human creation, but in fact it is only the use of the inherent "ether" in the universe, plus the combination of some inherent materials. If science develops alone, and morality does not keep pace with it, then science will not only not benefit mankind, but will harm mankind. We can see what kind of effect science without moral support will produce by looking at the two World Wars in Europe, so morality and science should be used in conjunction with each other, and neither should be lacking. Science is the method of exploring the truth of things, while morality is the method of exploring the truth of being a person. If the truth of being a person has not been obtained, then what is the use of the truth of things to us? If morality and science can cooperate, then mankind will advance to civilization day by day. If morality and science are separated, then no matter how perfect science progresses, it will only accelerate the degradation of mankind. The world can survive without science, but it cannot survive without morality. Modern people admire science very much, which is not surprising in our country, which is backward in science, but they seem to neglect the issue of morality too much. Since morality is so important to mankind, we should actively promote it and never allow it to degenerate. Therefore, I believe that the first thing to do to improve society is to express the conditions of morality in the simplest way, so that everyone can know and practice them. So that everyone's behavior has something to rely on and something to admire. Some people also say that the world is still about power now, and you are still talking about morality, isn't it out of touch with the times? I don't think so, because the more immoral and barbaric the world is, the more we should talk about morality. We cannot stop promoting it just because some people don't want to listen. At the same time, we should think of various ways to influence everyone to listen. I have thought carefully, there are only five attitudes to being a person in the world: (1) benefiting others and oneself, (2) benefiting others without harming oneself, (3) benefiting others at the expense of oneself, (4) harming others to benefit oneself, (5) harming others without benefiting oneself. The first one is the most reasonable, the second one can also be done, the third one cannot be done by ordinary people, the fourth one is unacceptable, and the fifth one is even more unacceptable. The so-called simple moral standards and methods are to teach people how to achieve the most reasonable attitude mentioned above, that is, how to benefit others and oneself.</p>
<p>To commemorate my mother's birthday this time, in order to make it more meaningful and more beneficial to society and the public, I am holding the following three events.</p>
<p>The first thing is to first invite famous Confucian scholars to extract the essence of the Five Teachings that are related to the morality of being a person and give a comprehensive and simple lecture. On the one hand, I will hire a versatile person to compile the integration of Confucianism, Buddhism, Taoism, Christianity, and Islam. I believe that all sciences can be standardized, have laws, have a certain program, and have the arguments of things, while morality has never been so concrete. In theory and method, it has always been chaotic and without standards, and there are often disputes and no agreement. Even those who are determined to rely on morality are slow to see results, not as fast and easy to see as science. Therefore, I feel that morality also needs a definite standard process to teach people how to get started. Although the objects of worship of Confucianism, Buddhism, Taoism, Christianity, and Islam are different, and the rituals used are different, their purpose is always to persuade people to do good and eliminate evil. If everyone can understand the true meaning of religion and everyone can practice the true meaning of religion, then it will not be difficult for the whole world to achieve perfection. However, the doctrines of the Five Teachings are profound and meaningful, and not everyone can understand their mysteries, but there are also many that are easy to understand and easy to practice, which can be used as an introductory method to the morality of being a person. This book has been being compiled for quite some time, with each teaching being a book, and it will be printed and published soon.</p>
<p>The second thing is to translate the five famous works of the British Confucian scholar Samuel Smiles: "Self-Help," "Character," "Duty," "Thrift," and "Life and Labour," to supplement the inadequacy of the "Integration of the Five Teachings." These books explain the principles of self-cultivation, career establishment, dealing with the world, and being a person very clearly, and there are many examples, which are most likely to inspire people. Europe has these immortal masterpieces that can benefit the world and people, but unfortunately they will not study them and use them, and only know how to focus on material science, resulting in an unprecedented disaster, which is so painful! I have always admired these books the most in my life and have benefited the most from them, so I specially introduce them to the society. What the "Introduction to the Five Teachings" has not covered can be found in these books. I have already started translating, but the work is very tedious, and I hope it can be completed within one or two years.</p>
<h3>Female Nurse Dies: Autopsy Completed</h3>
<p>Li Yuying, also known as Li Jieru, a female head nurse from Fujian at the Sino-Western Nursing School on Route Paul Henry, suddenly died in her bedroom at the hospital on the night of the 11th of this month. The person in charge of the hospital did not report it to the police station, but instead signed a certificate of death due to a stroke and sent the body to the Chinese Funeral Home for encoffining. When the body was about to be buried in the Hongqiao Cemetery, a letter was sent to the French police station. The police station suspended the coffin and sent it to the autopsy office. The hospital's business manager, Mu Zhenqing, doctor Lin Zhengliang, and the deceased's parents were summoned to the case. The Second Special District Court was requested to send someone to open the coffin and dissect the body. The stomach was removed, and undigested rice, food, and vegetables were taken to the hospital for analysis and verification. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. After the body was stitched up, it was re-encoffined and temporarily stored in the autopsy office. It was not until yesterday that the Chinese Funeral Home transported the coffin back to the funeral home, preparing for a scheduled burial.</p>
<h3>Unable to Endure Abuse: Husband and Wife Sue</h3>
<p>Luo Zengshan, a 26-year-old man from Shanyin, Shaoxing, living at No. 54, Daodeli, Route de Bayle, is the elder brother of Luo Guifang, a dancer at the Hongxing Dance Hall in Hong Kong. Recently, his wife Xu Aizhen (18 years old, living at No. 13, Wenanfang, Route de Bayle) hired a lawyer to file a petition with the Civil Court of the Second Special District Court, requesting mediation for divorce due to unbearable abuse. According to the petition, the court summoned both parties for mediation in the Civil Court Four Division on the morning of the day before yesterday. First, the petitioner's lawyer stated the previous situation, and then the opposing party also appointed a lawyer to appear on his behalf and opposed the divorce. After verifying the situation in court, because both parties had no sincerity in reconciliation, the mediation was declared unsuccessful, and the petitioner was ordered to file a formal lawsuit.</p>
<p>A woman named Hua Chen Ruying of No. 30, Jianzhongli, Route Victor Emmanuel III, recently commissioned lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Enliang to file a petition with the Civil Court of the Second Special District Court against her husband, Hua Yimei, alleging abandonment, difficult living conditions, requesting a judgment ordering cohabitation, payment of living expenses of 40 yuan per month, surrender of the girl, and exercise of guardianship. On the afternoon of the day before yesterday, Judge Ma Yishu opened the Civil Court Seven Division to summon both parties for trial. The plaintiff's lawyer represented and stated the details of the case. The defendant commissioned lawyers Jiang Yiping and Yang Yunshi to represent and defend, requesting the rejection of the plaintiff's lawsuit and stating their reasons. After verifying the situation in court, the court instructed the parties to postpone the hearing and try to reconcile outside the court.</p>
<h3>Yuande Bank Accused: Sued for Bill Payment</h3>
<p>The Defendant Seeks to Resolve the Situation, Requests Postponement Unapproved</p>
<p>Today is the last day of the first half of the year's business for the financial industry. Although it is Sunday, Chinese and foreign banks are closed as usual, but money shops are still busy closing their accounts. Fortunately, the financial market has been relatively stable recently, and there have been no drastic changes as at the end of April, so no accidents have occurred. During the end of April, many money shops that also engaged in speculative businesses were quite affected, but they were able to tide over the difficulties safely because their weaknesses were never exposed. However, Yuande Money Shop at No. 205 Beijing Road was in a very precarious situation at the time, so it successively issued cashier's checks to exchange for a large amount of cash to raise funds for turnover and seek to make up for the losses. However, due to insufficient strength, all of the checks were dishonored upon maturity. The holders of the checks rose up in protest, but the manager of the shop, Huang Aitang, was unable to cope. At first, he wanted to ignore the debts. It was not until Zhu Baolin, one of the holders of the checks, first filed a lawsuit with the First Special District Local Court, and other creditors followed suit, that he realized that the situation was gradually becoming tense and difficult to shirk. He urgently requested the other creditors to postpone the recovery, and at the same time convened a creditors' meeting to discuss a proper solution, so as to enable the shop to continue its business, which is also to protect the interests of all creditors. After both parties decided, Huang commissioned an accountant to review all of Yuande's</p>
<p>accounts first. As for how to pay off the debts, there is no concrete decision yet. The case previously filed by Zhu Baolin was due to be heard yesterday. The defendant Yuande Shop and its manager Huang Aitang jointly appointed a lawyer to appear in court and admitted that the amount of the bill claimed by Zhu was correct. However, the defendant requested an extension of time on the grounds that it was seeking a complete solution to all debts and had already obtained the plaintiff's consent. Judge Gui, who was in charge of the trial, believed that since the defendant had</p>
<p>already admitted the amount of the debt, there was no need for an extension, and then announced the end of the debate and scheduled a judgment. Under the advice of the two lawyers, they deeply considered that once a judgment was made, it might affect other aspects, so they still complained and insisted that the words "oppose the announcement of the end of the debate" be recorded in the minutes.</p>
<h3>Lawsuit to Recover Tuition Fees: Principal of Zhendong School Replaced</h3>
<p>Fan Shenxiong, the principal of Zhendong Primary School at the intersection of Route Grelot and Rue Pichon, was widely criticized for suing two Liu students for arrears of 21 yuan in tuition fees, arousing public outrage. After investigation by the education authorities, it was found to be true, and the school's board of directors was ordered to dismiss the principal to maintain discipline. It is now learned that the school's board of directors has decided to replace him and appoint Yang Chunlu as his successor.</p>
<h3>Wife Reports Husband for Adultery: Husband Dies by Poisoning</h3>
<p>Qin Zuyin, a native of Changzhou, currently working as a clerk in the pseudo-Unified Tax Bureau and nephew of Sheng Gongbao, married Wu Zhen, a woman from Xuzhou, and then took He Lizhen, a dancer from the Dadong Dance Hall, as his concubine this year, living together at No. 15, Sanxingfang, Connaught Road. Wu learned of this and hired lawyer Mao Xianshen to report to the Gordon Road Police Station. On June 18, they went to capture the adulterous couple and took them back to the police station, where they were released and awaited a court summons. Qin then secretly swallowed Lysol to commit suicide. He was rushed to Baolong Hospital for treatment. Therefore, when the court summoned him on the 25th, Qin was unable to appear in court because he was in the hospital, and the hearing was rescheduled. It has now been learned that Qin died of poisoning, and although he was rescued, it was ineffective. He died yesterday, and the body was sent to the autopsy office by the police station to await the report to the court for an autopsy and re-examination.</p>
<h3>Zhao Zhimin's Letter of Clarification: My Daughter Joins the Army Voluntarily</h3>
<p>Saving the Country is Protecting the Family, Loyalty is Completing Filial Piety</p>
<p>Respected Editor,</p>
<p>I am writing to you today to clarify that my daughter, Guomei, has always been trained in poetry and etiquette, and strictly adhered to the teachings of Yuan Bing. She has been praised by teachers and neighbors for her filial piety and thoughtful discernment. Before August 13th, she graduated as a champion from Shangwen Primary School in the city and won a scholarship to be recommended to Shaoxing Shanghai Women's Middle School. At that time, it was the peak of the patriotic movement, and her enthusiasm was always expressed in her words. The family thought that this was the normal state of patriotic youth, so they did not care. Unexpectedly, on the morning of the 16th of this month, she quietly left home and joined the army, giving up her studies. At first, I asked the police station to visit and inquire, sent people to stand at the port and wait, and then posted a notice in the newspaper to inform relatives and friends, originally hoping that she would return home, comfort her mother, and help her with her luggage and funds to strengthen her journey. It is not really to stop her ambition, and there is no doubt about Chen, and there is no other worry in it. Therefore, I calmly dealt with it and went to Wuxing to handle goods. It was not until I returned home the day before yesterday that my family showed me a news item published in your newspaper on the 22nd of this month. After reading it, I was filled with indignation. The so-called teacher-student love affair and running away together did not match the facts. Yesterday, I received a letter from my daughter from the front line, reporting that she had been commissioned to a formal position and was engaged in practical work. I am very happy and can rest assured that I am far away. In the letter, she also said that today she joined the army, and she showed the spirit of a woman. Next spring, she will return in triumph and fulfill her wish to honor her ancestors. Moreover, the rise and fall of the country is the responsibility of every man. A patriot sacrifices himself to achieve benevolence. If a mother seeks to live by harming benevolence, saving the country is protecting the family, and loyalty is completing filial piety. At this time, the War of Resistance has reached the final stage of struggle, which is a critical moment, and the final victory belongs to us. I hope that the hall will not be sad and worried because the woman is traveling a long distance, but should be happy and celebrate the woman's heart to serve the country. Her words are so慷慨激昂, that they can make cowards rise up, and women compete for glory. It can be praised by the society, and her parents are also honored. I have always thought that your newspaper's news is known for its impartiality and realism. I respectfully ask you to publish my original letter as it is to clarify the facts and stop the rumors. I hereby offer this, and I wish you peace.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Zhao Zhimin</p>
<p>June 30, 29th year.</p>

<h3>Review of the Implementation of the Inheritance Tax</h3>
<p>— Cao Huo</p>
<p>The Process of Planning the Tax</p>
<p>The much-discussed inheritance tax is finally being implemented nationwide starting today.</p>
<p>Inheritance is 100% unearned income; John Stuart Mill said, "No one should enjoy more inheritance than is necessary for his independent living." It should be heavily taxed. England began collecting it as early as 1694. There were also proposals for collection in China at the beginning of the Republic, but for many years, drafting bills and setting principles were just "hearing the ladder rattle, but not seeing anyone come down." 1928 was considered a time to make a decision. In May, the National Government made a declaration to implement the inheritance tax to develop education, and in July of the same year, the National Financial Conference had a proposal to implement income and inheritance taxes as special taxes for education. In 1929, the Inheritance Tax Regulations and Implementation Rules were further formulated, and it seemed that they could be promoted step by step. Unexpectedly, the foreign experts of the Kemmerer Commission, who were heavily hired to reform finance at that time, believed that, according to Chinese customs, wealthy families mostly relied on inheritance to live on. If inheritance tax were collected, it would be greatly disadvantageous to China (see the Tax System Report of the Commission). These foreign financial experts valued China's large family system as much as foreign education experts advised us to read the Analects of Confucius and Mencius, respecting our old morality with the same good intentions. As a result, the implementation of the inheritance tax was once again shelved.</p>
<p>Later, in 1936, under Finance Minister Kong's policy of increasing taxes to balance fiscal revenues and expenditures, the government again made a firm decision to implement it. Therefore, the principles and drafts were revised in many ways. In September 1938, the Provisional Inheritance Tax Regulations were passed, and on December 30, 1939, the Implementation Rules of the Provisional Inheritance Tax Regulations were promulgated. Now that it has been officially implemented, China's finances have taken a major step forward on the path of direct taxation, which is truly another cause for celebration during the period of resistance and nation-building.</p>
<p>Judging from the promulgated Provisional Regulations, they are meticulous and comprehensive, and quite satisfactory.</p>
<p>First of all, we must point out that the adoption of the gross estate system in these regulations is its greatest advantage. The gross estate tax (also known as inheritance tax) is different from the distributed inheritance tax (also known as succession tax). The former taxes the total value of the estate, while the latter taxes each heir or beneficiary separately based on their degree of kinship. Regarding the advantages and disadvantages of the two, it is generally believed that the gross estate tax has higher revenue when calculated, but it does not consider the degree of kinship, so close and distant relatives are treated the same despite having different opportunities, which is unfair. Conversely, the distributed inheritance tax taxes based on the degree of kinship, which is fair, but the calculation is complicated, and because the tax exemption is not applied just once, the revenue is reduced. It is said that the Legislative Yuan had many objections to the draft adopting the gross estate system because they considered the gross estate system unfair, holding the above view. In fact, the distributed inheritance system distinguishes between close and distant relatives, which encourages the inheritance of property to close relatives, thus concentrating wealth in the hands of one or two people (the children of wealthy people, by virtue of their father's position, money, and power, have probably already made a considerable fortune before their father's death). Is this fair? Moreover, so-called distant relatives in China, where inheritance is traditionally passed on to the closest heirs, can only receive inheritance if they have made great contributions to the deceased during their lifetime. The idea that they have a greater opportunity than the closest children is unfounded. Therefore, I believe that the gross estate system is fairer than the distributed inheritance system, and it is simpler and generates more revenue, which is exactly what is needed at this time and place. China's inheritance tax "is a central tax, but the central government should distribute its net revenue to provinces, cities, and counties according to the following standards: (1) 15% to provinces, (2) 25% to cities and counties. Provinces, cities, and counties should use 40% of the aforementioned net revenue for educational expenses." (See Article 5 of the Fiscal Revenue and Expenditure System Law promulgated in 1935). The local governments' share can also compensate for the loss from abolishing miscellaneous taxes, and its use is mainly limited to developing education, which is quite commendable in today's situation where education is becoming increasingly important but funding is becoming increasingly difficult.</p>
<p>There were two theories regarding the scope of inheritance tax: the territoriality principle and the nationality principle. The former is: all property left in this country at the time of death is taxed, regardless of nationality or whether they are citizens of this country; the latter is: all citizens of this country, their inheritance, regardless of where it is located, whether in another country or this country, must be taxed. China adopts both (see Article 1 of the Provisional Regulations) because the territoriality principle alone easily induces capital to escape abroad, and the nationality principle alone would not generate much tax revenue. The combination of the two shows careful consideration.</p>
<p>"The term 'inheritance' in these Regulations refers to the movable property, immovable property, and all other rights with property value of the deceased" (Article 2 of the Provisional Regulations). The meaning of inheritance adopts traditional academic theory, with death and property as the constituent elements of inheritance. However, some people believe: "The finding of lost property and the discovery of buried objects, after a certain period of public notice, if the owners still do not claim their property, it proves that they have no possibility of retrieving the property, and the property contains the meaning of inheritance," and "the inheritance tax is set up to limit people's accidental good fortune, and the good fortune of finders and discoverers is no less than that of those who receive inheritance." Therefore, they advocate expanding the interpretation of inheritance and including the tax on lost property and buried objects in the calculation, and propose to "presume that the recipient cannot prove that the original owner was alive at the time of inheritance" and tax them according to the regulations. This opinion has considerable merit, and I believe the financial authorities may still consider it in the future.</p>
<p>The valuation of inheritance in various countries uses market price as the standard. This is also the case in China (see Article 5 of the Provisional Regulations). However, while valuing general property according to market price is fair, it is not the case for immovable property such as land and houses, especially land, which is not easy to liquidate. Fortunately, Article 12 of the Implementing Regulations states, "If the valuation of immovable property such as land and houses cannot be assessed according to the market price at the time of inheritance, the amount shall be calculated by restoring the rent at a weekly interest rate of 12%," and there are other preferential measures for relief. Article 9 of the Provisional Regulations has a rule for taxing owner-cultivated land at half price. Of course, this also has the meaning of encouraging owner-cultivation. In recent years, the rural areas have suffered greatly, and the people of Jiangsu have been impoverished. To revive the rural areas, this regulation is indispensable. Similarly, Article 10 stipulates that "trees that are legally prohibited from being cut down or have not reached the age of felling should be deducted first," in order to promote afforestation. All of these are the advantages of our inheritance tax.</p>
<p>However, I still have a few opinions on the Provisional Regulations:</p>
<p>1. A certain amount of educational funds should be stipulated for minor heirs; funeral expenses should also be set at a maximum amount. These three, together with the deceased's final medical expenses, should be deducted first when calculating the total value of the deceased's estate; this point can be added to Article 10 of the Provisional Regulations.</p>
<p>2. Article 7 "(2) The inheritance of officers, soldiers, and civil servants of the army, navy, and air force who died in battle or due to injuries sustained in battlefield service" should be changed to "The inheritance of officers... who died..., whose total value is less than ×× yuan" should be tax-exempt, and there should be a certain limit. In fact, many soldiers and civil servants in China possess huge wealth. Although dying in battle is for the country, it is not necessary to give such excessive preferential treatment.</p>
<p>3. Article 7 (5) Property donated to educational, cultural, or charitable public welfare undertakings not exceeding 500,000 yuan is tax-exempt. This is also worth reconsidering. For the government to implement its original motivation for developing education and culture through inheritance tax, and to encourage citizens to donate to charitable public welfare undertakings and eliminate the old concept of caring only for one's own family, the donated portion should be completely tax-exempt.</p>
<p>4. Article 8 "If inheritance that has already been subject to inheritance tax is inherited again within three years, the value of the property that has already been taxed shall be exempt from taxation again": The government is too "concerned" about public sentiment. I agree with the proposal of the Italian Engenis Rignano. His proposal (or method) is this: the portion of the deceased's inheritance that comes from their own hard work and frugality is taxed at the normal rate; the property inherited directly from their father or others is taxed at a rate of 50%; the property inherited indirectly from their father or others is taxed at a rate of 100%. Only this method can completely limit people's accidental good fortune; only this can encourage people's hard work and frugality; only this can increase revenue (the national budget for this year only lists 2 million yuan), meet the needs of the current resistance and nation-building; and only this can regulate capital and achieve the ideal of people's livelihood. Assuming that this is done, it is necessary to divide people's property into two parts at the beginning of inheritance or, preferably, when investigating people's property after the promulgation of this tax system: (1) two-thirds or one-half is considered the result of their own hard work, (2) two-thirds or one-half is considered inheritance that has already gone through one transfer.</p>
<p>Regarding the inheritance tax system itself, that's probably all I have to say.</p>
<h3>The Problem of Property Investigation</h3>
<p>However, whether the inheritance tax succeeds or not depends half on the quality of the tax system itself and half on whether there are difficulties after implementation and whether it can prevent tax evasion. This involves the issue of property investigation. Evasion, concealment, and private gifts of various kinds are probably unavoidable. Here, we must remember that China's current resistance is a national resistance. The glory of our ancestors and the happiness of our descendants all depend on it. "Those with money give money, those with strength give strength," and this is the truth. When the majority of the people are fighting with guns and bullets and shedding their blood on the front lines, it is unacceptable to evade taxes on unearned income. It is unacceptable and should not be condoned or pitied. So, what methods can be used to overcome this difficult hurdle of property investigation? There is! There are the people; mobilize the people, organize them, and let them report, then it will be easy and reliable. Even the most cunning landlords and wealthy gentry cannot escape the eyes of the majority of poor people. The closing remarks of the Fourth National Political Consultative Conference said, "If China wants to achieve its absolutely necessary war objectives, it must mobilize the whole nation and strengthen all facilities for long-term resistance." As for the need to abolish household names, ancestral hall names, pen names, and nicknames, and limit each person to using one name, this should be implemented immediately and need not be said further.</p>
<h3>Market Knowledge Consultant</h3>
<p>Liu Qi Jun Asks</p>
<p>(1) How are the official exchange rate and the black market exchange rate calculated? Please list the calculation method and formula using the US dollar as an example, and explain in detail. (The answer was published in issue 324 of this publication)</p>
<p>(2) What is the basis for the rise and fall of gold prices? Please list the formula and explain in detail how to calculate it.</p>
<p>(3) Is it more advantageous to purchase US dollars in Hong Kong or Haiphong with Hong Kong dollars or Vietnamese currency than to buy US dollars in Shanghai with legal tender?</p>
<p>Mr. Ye Jingjiang Answers</p>
<p>(2) Previously, the rise and fall of gold prices in Shanghai were based on London cash. Since England stopped the gold standard in 1931, it has been changed to the US cash exchange rate to determine the rise and fall. However, sometimes the supply and demand and changes in the current situation are also sufficient to affect the rise and fall of market prices. (For example, if the price of US dollars is 35 yuan per ounce, then one US dollar is 16 yuan in legal tender (exchange rate 517/32), and each ounce weighs 848495 qiankaiping, which is multiplied by 8525 to get the Shanghai gold price.</p>
<p>(3) Purchasing US dollars in Hong Kong or Haiphong with Hong Kong dollars or Vietnamese currency requires going through proper procedures and applying to the bank due to restrictions by the local governments. Black market transactions in Shanghai are not restricted and can be traded at any time, which is more convenient.</p>
<p>Cheng Jiyi Jun Asks</p>
<p>(1) After the European War, England controlled foreign exchange. Why can British pounds still be sold in Shanghai even though China was not included in the pound sterling group? Although it is said to be speculative buying and selling, it must be based on actual needs. If merchant A sells £10,000 to merchant B, and merchant B actually needs £1,000, in theory, they would have to obtain a certificate or draft from merchant A's office or agent in England to withdraw the pounds. Is this not the same as trading British pounds in Shanghai? Wouldn't the control lose its effectiveness? How can the British government turn a blind eye to this? (2) Also, if A's US dollars are in Liverpool or Hong Kong, and B needs to withdraw funds in London, the transaction must still be done through a bank. Would the bank dare to violate the law and serve them? Furthermore, if A has funds deposited in a London bank, they must hand over the deposit slip to B, who can only complete the transaction after sending the deposit slip to London and withdrawing the funds. If this is the case, it takes a long time and the procedures are complicated. Why is the foreign exchange market in Shanghai so convenient? Delivery can be made on the same day?</p>
<p>(3) If merchants A and B do not know each other and the transaction amount is very large, does the broker guarantee that A will deliver the British pounds to B in England after receiving B's domestic currency? Does the broker have the ability to guarantee this?</p>
<p>(4) According to previous reports, Hong Kong restricts the export of banknotes and foreign exchange of non-pound sterling groups. However, according to the exchange rate information column of the Ta Kung Pao, Hong Kong banks buy and sell Shanghai currency every day as before, and the amount is always in the tens or hundreds of thousands. However, there are various restrictions on individuals entrusting banks to exchange funds. What is the truth of the matter?</p>
<p>(5) The market often hears that a certain amount of British pounds or US dollars is with a certain merchant. These British and US dollars must be bearer drafts, only recording the amount and the location of the withdrawing bank. Can they be bought and sold in all major cities with a foreign exchange market?</p>
<p>(6) If merchant A needs to deliver US dollars to merchant B in Hong Kong, can they buy US dollars in Shanghai or US dollars for delivery in Hong Kong and then send the voucher to Hong Kong to be delivered to merchant B? Or resell it to domestic merchants?</p>
<h3>—Mr. Ye Qingjiang Answers—</h3>
<p>Regarding "Why can British pounds still be sold in Shanghai even though England controls foreign exchange and China was not included in the pound sterling group," it is because the payment is made in London, which does not violate the control regulations. Therefore, British pounds can still be sold in Shanghai. For example, if A sells £10,000 to B, then A must issue a cheque for £10,000 from A's British agent bank to B, and B can use the cheque to withdraw cash from the British agent bank. What B gets is £10,000, which can still be used within England and cannot be exchanged for US dollars or other foreign currencies. British capital has not flowed out of the country, so it is not within the scope of control.</p>
<p>Banks can still apply for British pounds for merchants who need them for legitimate purposes, and are not subject to control. Therefore, if A's US dollars are in Liverpool or Hong Kong, as long as the proper procedures are followed, i.e., A issues a British pound cheque to B, any bank within England can handle all the procedures on behalf of A. This does not violate the law. As for "A has funds deposited in a London bank... Why can the trade of British pounds in Shanghai be settled on the same day?" it is because it is a telegraphic transfer. Selling or buying is all based on telegram communication. Trading with bills of exchange requires going through bank procedures to be cashed, so the procedures are naturally more troublesome.</p>
<p>In addition to deposits, there are also agricultural products exported from China, such as tung oil, pig bristles, and tea, and light industrial products that are shipped abroad, all of which can be exchanged for gold pounds, which are temporarily deposited in London banks, waiting for a good opportunity to sell them. In addition, overseas Chinese send money to their home country, which is also a large amount. Overseas Chinese often entrust banks here to sell British pounds on their behalf.</p>
<p>Brokers can only guarantee the transaction on the same day or limit delivery to Shanghai for agency purchases and sales and cannot guarantee whether British pounds will be delivered in England. However, in fact, there is no problem if the purchase and sale of gold pound drafts is handled by a reliable bank.</p>
<p>Although the Hong Kong government has ordered a ban on the export of Hong Kong dollars, in fact, if there is a legitimate purpose and Hong Kong banknotes are needed, one can still apply to the government-approved commercial banks in Hong Kong for purchase and sale. Speculative sales are absolutely prohibited.</p>
<p>Bearer British and US dollar drafts can all be transferred for purchase and sale in this city's market.</p>
<p>If merchant A needs to deliver a certain amount of US dollars to merchant B in Hong Kong, they can buy US dollars for delivery in Shanghai or Hong Kong. B can use the draft to exchange for US dollars in Hong Kong. If it is a Bearer draft, it can also be resold to merchant C. Here are brief answers to the three questions of Zhang Shiwen Jun:</p>
<p>(1) The reported price of US dollars refers to the price of pure gold contained in a US$5 coin. The price of US dollars refers to the exchange rate of a US$1 banknote. Therefore, the prices of the two differ greatly. The same is true for British gold and British pounds.</p>
<p>A US$5 coin contains 0.240176 shi qian liang of pure gold, which is multiplied by the red price to get the market price of a US$5 coin.</p>
<p>US$5 coin</p>
<p>A British £1 coin contains 0.23382 shi qian liang of pure gold, which is multiplied by the red price to get the market price. The calculation is as above.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the weight and fineness of coins from various countries, please refer to issue 301 of this publication.</p>
<p>(3) Soverein is the name of a coin in the British currency system calculated in pounds, with denominations of £5, £2, £1, and half a pound. Sterling is used to mean a standard pound sterling.</p>

<p>The blocked marks used in Germany have a high value domestically but have no market abroad, so their value is extremely low. However, in principle, the foreign purchasing power of free marks (i.e., TT marks) should be equivalent to the domestic purchasing power of blocked marks. However, the purchasing power of blocked marks is limited to within Germany, so even if the exchange rate of free marks abroad represents the value of blocked marks, various transportation costs should be deducted, resulting in a discount. This discount, in addition to including various transportation costs, is also affected by the supply and demand in the market, so it is extremely large. Especially in wartime today, there is only a market price for German currency, and transportation is very difficult. The amount of the discount is even more difficult to calculate. Therefore, the foreign value of blocked marks cannot be compared with that of free marks.</p>
<p>When your respected friend in Germany buys books on your behalf and pays with blocked marks, and you plan to compensate their relatives in Shanghai with legal tender, this causes difficulties in pricing. I sincerely seek your inquiry to this publication. In my humble opinion, in order to prevent both parties from losing out, it is more convenient to calculate by referring to the pricing method of German goods in Shanghai. I don't know what you think. Here are brief answers to the two questions of Li Guangzhou Jun:</p>
<p>(1) In early March of 1928, China implemented a foreign exchange declaration system, centralizing the right to supply foreign exchange to the Central Bank. Illegal elements took advantage of the special circumstances of the concessions and continued to buy and sell foreign exchange freely outside the Central Bank, thus forming this black market for foreign exchange. Therefore, those who enter and leave the black market should be punished by law.</p>

<h3>Factors Affecting Foreign Exchange Fluctuations Last Week</h3>
<p>According to a report by the Shanghai Economic Consulting Institute, the foreign exchange market this week was relatively calm. The highest US dollar exchange rate was 6.3125 yuan, the lowest was 5.9375 yuan. The highest British pound exchange rate was 3 pence 96875, and the lowest was 3 pence 75. According to market rumors, the factors affecting the fluctuations are as follows:</p>
<p>1. Tensions in Vietnam 2. US Fleet Mobilization 3. Approaching End of the Month 4. British and American Exchanges Lengthening 5. Falling Prices</p>
<p>At the beginning of the week, the tense situation in Vietnam, the unstable border in Hong Kong, and the occupation of Xujiahui in Shanghai should have tightened the market, but the transaction volume was extremely small, and most people were waiting and watching. The US dollar was more sensitive to the news than the exchange rates because Citibank's exchange rate was convenient for retail transactions. In the past two weeks, given the calm exchange market, large investors lacked interest, and retail investors were eager to move after being quiet for too long. However, the momentum was not strong, and it fluctuated at the slightest stimulation. The US fleet's mobilization, if aimed at the Far East, seemed to have a positive impact on the exchange market. If it was to support Britain, the doubts about foreign currencies would be heavier, and the exchange market could also be seen as lengthening. However, the international situation is constantly changing, and opinions vary from person to person, depending on future developments. Approaching the end of the month, coupled with the three-day holiday, operators avoided taking risks, and there were very few transactions. Moreover, after the expansion of the European War, foreign banks such as China-Italy, China-France, Oriental, China-Belgium, and the Netherlands have rarely interacted in the exchange market. Currently, only Chase, Citibank, and Advantage are more active, and Chinese commercial banks also appear and disappear, leading to the current depletion of the market. Even if there are transactions, there are few opponents. The British and US exchange rates rose to 4.01 yuan on Friday, mostly due to the tightening of management by the United Kingdom. What the content is is still unknown, so there are many different explanations. Some say that the United States will assist Britain financially, and some say that Europe may be at peace. However, the traditional concept in Shanghai is that the legal currency is more closely linked to gold pounds, so when the US dollar rises, the exchange market tends to be seen as loosening. Falling prices should reflect the increased purchasing power of the legal currency. However, the current cost of living has not changed, and the sharp rise and fall are only objects of speculation. In the past, the people of Shanghai's belief in the legal currency was sometimes unclear. If they did not rush to buy foreign exchange, they would hoard it. After the outbreak of the European War, this long-standing problem became even more intense. Exchange rates and hoarding are causally related, resulting in an unprecedented surge. But how long has it been? Commodity prices have fallen drastically, and exchange rates have also tended to loosen at the same time. The most obvious example is that the prices of foreign shares and cotton yarn have fallen by more than one or two times. However, because the excessive fall in prices is enough to reduce imports, there is little demand for exchange rates. Even those who have foreign exchange intend to sell it in order to buy goods that have fallen in price. The supply in the exchange market has increased. Those who take advantage of this psychology take the opportunity to sell short, putting considerable pressure on the market, and the general floating longs are quite panicked. At first, they hesitated and watched, and then they painfully settled, resulting in the current situation. By Saturday, the trend changed slightly. The British and US exchange rates were small, and they should have lengthened first, but instead they shrunk slightly with the US dollar. In addition, the yarn market suddenly showed a tendency to rise, and the exchange rate discounts wanted to fall but stopped. Although there was inevitably some short-covering and the role of the month-end holiday, there was an intention to try again in the market.</p>
<h3>Coal Ball Factory Price Increase</h3>
<p>Coal ball factory prices, due to the previous week's loosening of the exchange rate and reduced material costs, although outwardly maintained, secretly experienced a price drop to compete. Yesterday, due to an unfavorable rumor, the prices of coal balls from Nanyang, Guohua, and Yitaixing became firm again. Wholesale prices for the same industry have generally increased, with a carload costing one hundred and forty-eight yuan, and additional cartage for delivery. Retail prices at the door of shops on this street are generally eight yuan per load, it is said.</p>
<h3>Government Red Dates Arrive in One Hundred Packages</h3>
<p>Top-quality government red dates have long been out of stock in the market, and merchants have limited inventory on hand, so the market is quite strong. Yesterday, it was heard that Qingdao merchants had shipped one hundred packages, priced at thirty-eight yuan. However, because the merchants' counteroffer was too far off, no transaction has been made yet.</p>
<h3>Dutch Red Sugar Rises by Eight Cents</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market continued to tighten, with both red and white sugar improving. The current price of Grade 24 white sugar set by the guild was 69.4 yuan at this company and 69 yuan at other companies, up by five cents. Re-exported sugar was 55 yuan, up by one yuan. Taikoo's "B Mark" refined white sugar was initially 78.5 yuan but later reached 79 yuan. Dutch red sugar was between 56.5 yuan and 56.8 yuan, up by eight cents overall. Guotang Xinghua Dagong powder was offered at 100 yuan, but there were no transactions. Yesterday, 30 packages of ordinary Gong powder were offered at 86.5 yuan.</p>
<h3>Tapioca Flour and Sago - Sporadic Transactions</h3>
<p>The market has ample tapioca flour in stock. Recently, due to sluggish demand, only sporadic transactions have occurred, and the trend is weaker. Currently, Feiqilin brand is priced at 67 yuan, KG and SanX brand are both priced at 65 yuan, ShuangTA brand is 55 yuan, Peacock is 55 yuan, TT brand is 52 yuan, and Sanling brand is 45 yuan, about one yuan lower than before. Large-grain sago is still selling for 90 yuan, and smaller grains for 88 yuan, down by two yuan.</p>
<h3>Bud Sticks Fall by Four to Five Yuan</h3>
<p>Although there have been no recent arrivals of bud sticks, demand has decreased, so the market supply is still considered ample. Currently, there are only sporadic transactions, and the market price has also weakened, falling by four to five "codes" from the previous high.</p>
<h3>Dried Longan Meat Remains Expensive</h3>
<p>There is no continued arrival of dried longan meat, and sun-dried goods from the docks have not been shipped for even longer, leading to stockouts. It is heard that scattered inventories have been sold for as high as 210 yuan. Yesterday, according to letters from the production areas, inventories are limited, and production prices are as high as 200 yuan. Adding all external costs, it is difficult to break even. Therefore, it is unlikely that new goods will arrive before the new harvest.</p>
<h3>Ribbed Steel Bar Market Stagnant</h3>
<p>Transactions of ribbed steel bars have been sluggish recently. Apart from minor purchases by local construction companies, there have been no transactions from out-of-town merchants. The market is particularly stagnant, and the market situation is therefore depressed. Industry insiders, due to the perception of a lack of supply, are unwilling to significantly lower prices. Although there are not many transactions, empty orders must also remain high. Currently, the market price is 1,350 yuan per ton for 3/8 inch and 1/2 inch, and 1,300 yuan per ton for 5/8 inch to 1 inch, with no significant decline. It is heard that only over ten tons were traded previously, divided between construction companies and retail buyers. There is very little wholesale business.</p>

<h3>Silver Dollar Fluctuations</h3>
<p>Money shops are a major part of the market, and the price of silver dollars is constantly changing. Some change once a day, some twice, and some three or four times. What is the reason for this? When silver is in short supply, the price of silver increases sharply; when silver dollars are scarce, the exchange rate skyrockets. Traders meticulously calculate every penny, which is not surprising. However, there are also those who take advantage of the situation and engage in empty trading, without actual goods changing hands, relying only on ledger entries. Buyers hope for the price to increase daily; sellers hope for the price to fall. Driven by greed, reason is clouded by profit. Initially, they accumulate thousands upon thousands of dollars without seeing actual cash, driven by insatiable desires. Subsequently, when it comes time to settle accounts, one after another, they are filled with endless regrets. This trend is most prevalent in Ningbo, Shaoxing, Suzhou, and Hangzhou, and there are many who have lost their fortunes and even their lives because of it. Therefore, government officials issue notices to prohibit this, with clear and thorough warnings, but to no avail, as people outwardly comply but secretly defy. This trend is difficult to completely eliminate. In recent days, the price fluctuations of silver dollars have been frequently reported. From 72.0 cents, it has risen to 76.0 cents, and now it has fallen to 74.0 cents. In addition, there are constant fluctuations in the exchange rates between silver and silver dollars. This is precisely the mechanism of market prosperity and decline, the boundary between commercial circulation and stagnation. Those who profit from buying and selling short will inevitably lose elsewhere. It is feared that there will be changes in money shops. The set exchange rate for silver dollars in Shanghai has been 73.0 cents for a long time, but it is inevitable that there will be changes soon.</p>

<h3>The Vegetarian Movement</h3>
<p>— Cao Xing</p>
<p>The practice of vegetarianism has a long history, with its emphasis on abstaining from killing living beings, so Buddhist followers regard it as the only path to liberation. In fact, even from a scientific understanding, it is a good precept with three major benefits: peacefulness, economy, and hygiene.</p>
<p>The purpose of promoting vegetarianism now is not to promote Buddhism, but to respond to the environment and save money! Although the author has not tasted meat for three months, I have heard that the price of meat has risen to two yuan per catty, and other prices are imaginable. With such expensive meat prices, only wealthy families are qualified to enjoy it, and those of us who live on salaries can only look at it.</p>
<p>Originally, the most distressed people in the world are we. Every day of the year, we are busy with clothing and food, barely eking out a living. Unfortunately, we have encountered a troubled world, endured the baptism of gunfire, and also suffered the exploitation of unscrupulous merchants! This time, the increase in water rates, the additional levies by the Public Works Department, and the creation of opportunities for second landlords!</p>
<p>Since the threat to life is so serious, our only option is to plan for hardship and strive to save money. There are many ways to save money, but vegetarianism occupies a very important position. Although vegetarian dishes are not cheap either, they are much more economical than eating meat. At least, in terms of consumption, we can save one-third of our expenses. As the saying goes, "A little each day adds up to a lot in ten days." This can be tested in practice.</p>
<p>Some people say, "Humans are carnivorous animals. If they eat vegetarian food for a long time, it may be detrimental to their health." I think this is not entirely credible. To give an example: Buddhist followers who eat vegetarian food all their lives do not have weak bodies. Their lifespans are also in their seventies, eighties, or even hundreds. It can be seen that vegetarianism does not hinder health, only cleaner and more hygienic than eating meat.</p>
<p>It is common to see health experts eating vegetarian food in the summer. Eating vegetarian food is ultimately a good way to benefit life: both economical and hygienic, killing two birds with one stone. Why don't we promote it? In short, not eating rice can lead to starvation; not eating meat will not lead to death!</p>
<h3>Promoting Short Clothing</h3>
<p>— Bai Shui</p>
<p>Wearing a long gown makes movement inconvenient, especially in summer. We can often see people getting out of trams whose long gowns are not pulled up, causing them to be stepped on and torn by the people behind, resulting in arguments between the two parties. Sometimes, when we are carrying a lot of things in our hands, we cannot pull up our long gowns when walking up the stairs, so we often step on the front of our gowns, making it difficult to walk. Therefore, wearing a long gown hinders movement everywhere, making it difficult for us to move much, and we become weak. Everyone says that Chinese people are physically weak and lack activity, and this is one of the reasons. The reason for the lack of activity is that wearing a long gown is also one of the reasons. Therefore, to speak grandly, to strengthen the country, we must overthrow the long gown; to speak modestly, to have freedom and convenience of movement, we must overthrow the long gown. In today's expensive life, when the price of cotton cloth is several times higher than before "August 13th", it is already very difficult for us to add a piece of clothing, let alone spend money on materials to make a long gown. Therefore, to make clothing conform to economic principles, we should naturally overthrow the long gown.</p>
<p>Wearing a long gown and not wearing pants may be said to conform to economic principles; however, wearing pants with a long gown is still necessary. The long hem wastes a lot of cloth, the tailoring is more expensive than short clothes, and the washing is more expensive than short clothes. Moreover, with the added inconvenience, why do we spend more money to buy an inconvenience?</p>
<p>Some people say that not wearing a long gown is impolite, which is a joke! Do the working class who wear short clothes not understand etiquette? Is wearing a long gown and looking down on everyone, without regard for anyone, considered polite? Whether or not there is politeness depends entirely on the actions expressed from within, and has no fundamental relationship with whether or not a long gown is worn.</p>
<p>Some people say that we are used to wearing long gowns, and we feel uncomfortable not wearing them, which is also a joke! Are there not many Cantonese people who do not wear long gowns? If you walk into Hong Kong wearing a long gown and stroll around the streets, at that time, do you think you look good or not?</p>
<p>In winter, because of the cold weather, wearing long clothes can be warmer. As for summer, it really makes no sense to wear a long gown again. I remember that before "August 13th", the editors of the Shanghai Kaiming Bookstore, regardless of whether they wore Chinese or Western clothes, all wore short shirts. Because the sun blocked by the straw hats was very faint, everyone did not wear straw hats but opened paper umbrellas. I think we can imitate this action.</p>
<p>In a word, long gowns not only waste cloth but also hinder movement. We should abolish them. Even short shirts should not have sleeves that are too long, so as not to hinder movement, which is also very important.</p>
<h3>Random Thoughts on Residence</h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>Damp walls damage hanging paintings. Not hanging them seems too plain and lonely, failing to suit one's nature. The only solution is to fold newspapers, making them half an inch narrower than the painting, and nail them to the wall. Then, hang the painting. This way, moisture is isolated, and the newspaper is completely hidden by the painting, maintaining aesthetic appeal. If Li Yu, author of "Idle Sentiments," knew this, it would be a valuable addition to his collection.</p>
<p>A pavilion enveloped in the setting sun and thin mist has a ethereal, almost immortal quality. I recall a former senior's line, "Setting sun pavilion paints autumn traces," which I believe surpasses the artistry of painting and calligraphy.</p>
<p>The proverb says, "No matter how beautiful the peony, it relies on the green leaves for support." In fact, the green leaves are a different plant, not the peony's own leaves. "A Spot Record" states, "Peonies should be planted with green leaves in the same place for mutual flourishing." Those decorating gardens should be aware of this.</p>
<p>Paintings should be changed frequently, not only to prevent the silk and paper from becoming dull and old, but also to refresh the atmosphere and adjust one's perspective. Landscapes, figures, flowers, and beauties should be displayed interchangeably. Excessive simplicity can diminish the meaning. When changing paintings, books should also be readily available. Bookrests should be placed on either side, made of fine bamboo, with a cloud-white copper finial at one end. Even if not finely carved, they should have a delicate and intricate design. Otherwise, if they are rough and crude, like a beautiful woman with ugly companions, they will be unsuitable.</p>
<p>Everyday items, such as wine jugs and tea canisters, are often prepared casually without careful consideration. In reality, anything seen daily and touched daily should primarily evoke aesthetic pleasure. Otherwise, feelings of aversion will arise, failing to comfort the spirit. Moreover, exquisite items should be cherished and cared for, allowing them to last longer, which is also an economical practice.</p>
<p>When it comes to room furnishings, seek elegance over novelty. As time progresses endlessly, novelty soon becomes outdated. It is better to choose elegant items that remain unchanged, pleasing as always, and more appropriate.</p>
<p>A zither can cultivate emotions, a sword can express spirit, books can inspire ambition, and paintings can soothe the mind. These four items are indispensable in a home.</p>
<p>Arrangements should be skillful rather than grand, sparse rather than dense, simple rather than elaborate, and plain rather than ostentatious.</p>
<p>My deceased friend, Mr. Hu Jichen, said, "Beautiful clothes are not as good as beautiful rooms. The beauty of clothes pleases others. Only the beauty of rooms entertains oneself." Wise words!</p>
<p>At the end of the garden, plant more fine trees to provide dense shade, concealing the walls. This way, although it is the end, one does not feel it. Those within will not feel confined.</p>

<h3>One Week's Economical Menu</h3>
<p>— Ms. Hua Ying</p>
<p>Pork and yellow croaker are originally the most common items in meat dishes. Now, pork costs two yuan per catty, and yellow croaker costs six or seven cents per catty. How can I create this economical menu? However, rice must be eaten, and to eat rice, you must eat vegetables. Since meat dishes are unaffordable, I have to reduce the quantity as much as possible within the realm of possibility, and eat more vegetarian dishes. Fortunately, it is hot in summer, and eating vegetarian food is also a hygienic practice. I see that in some places, there is not even rice, and people are digging up grass roots and tree bark to eat. Being able to eat rice and vegetables on this isolated island is still a blessing. Nowadays, although I still include two meat dishes every day, I avoid the expensive ones and strive for economy. Whether you eat them or not is up to you.</p>

<h3>Viewing Bai Jiao's Orchid and Fruit and Vegetable Paintings</h3>
<p>— Zhou Shoujuan</p>
<p>I work like a horse for clothing, food, housing, and transportation every day, hardly knowing the joy of bronze inscriptions, calligraphy, and painting. My friend, Bai Jiao of Yunjian, is the opposite. He immerses himself in bronze inscriptions, calligraphy, and painting day and night, possessing an antique style and remarkable skill. He is an elegant person, indeed a refined person. He has exhibited hundreds of his works at the Da Xin Art Gallery for July. His calligraphy and seal carving are extraordinary. He has also displayed his orchid and fruit and vegetable paintings, which are also deeply rooted in antiquity. In recent days, prices are exorbitant, and people are struggling to survive. Even these flowers, grasses, fruits, and vegetables are not easily obtained. Viewing Bai Jiao's paintings is a delight to the eye and heart, and can alleviate hunger, perhaps in the sense of quenching thirst with plums. I have composed two quatrains:</p>
<p>Writing the soul of Xiang with each flower and leaf, I say that the scholar's habits remain,</p>
<p>There are countless worries and patriotic tears, flowing through the nine acres, planting sorrow and hatred.</p>
<p>Talented men of a hundred generations have no food to eat, Sighing that it is not easy to live in Chang'an,</p>
<p>Chen Shuo exhausted and starved to death, I beg you for the vegetables in the painting. (Note: The first line is adapted from Ding Yu's line, which is used today to praise the difficult times. Who says it is not appropriate?)</p>
<h3>Strolling on the Road</h3>
<p>— Chi Er</p>
<p>Most ordinary people think that "strolling on the road" is harmful and unhelpful. When there is nothing to do, it is better to sit at home. Now is a turbulent and eventful world, so it is best to avoid unexpected disasters outside. This argument is also correct, but I disagree. Because after we finish our work, we feel bored at home, so it is better to go to the road for a walk. On the one hand, we can take a walk to restore our physical and mental fatigue. At the same time, we can also pay attention to the dynamics of society, such as understanding the small scams of chess stalls, used goods stalls, and poker games on the roadside, and look at the things displayed in the glass windows on both sides, which are diverse and beautiful, opening our eyes and knowing the actual prices. In short, when strolling on the road, we can pay attention at all times and be careful everywhere. There is no place where we cannot gain some knowledge. Zeng Wenzheng Gong of the Qing Dynasty said: "Everywhere you pay attention is learning." I think this sentence is extremely correct. Because the universe is vast and full of wonders, the knowledge gained from books in school is limited. In the future, we will feel that it is not enough to apply in society, and we must seek some living knowledge to supplement it. Why not do it?</p>
<p>Finally, I must declare that I hope everyone will not misunderstand and think that I am promoting "strolling on the road". You must know that this can only be done after the work is completed, because the work at hand is very busy, so there is no time to stroll on the road. Now I am talking about doing it when you have free time, not "strolling on the road" that is done by "street walkers". As for the dangers on the road, you only need to be careful and not join in the excitement or get involved in the hustle and bustle. (Moved to Relieve Disaster)</p>
<h3>A Brief Account of Dietary Nourishment - Plum</h3>
<p>— Zhang Jingren</p>
<p>The plum is a kind of tall tree, with flowers blooming in the cold, its shadow filling the water and moon, and its fragrance spreading far and wide. After He Xun and Lin Hejing's descriptions, its beauty has increased even more. Therefore, every year at the end of the year, poets and writers use it as a clear offering for the study. Its flowers, dew, seeds, kernels, medicine stems, and roots can all be used as medicine. Single-petaled green plums are the best, and those with buds are more potent. The fruit ripens during the summer rainy season, with a emerald green color when unripe, and an apricot yellow to red color when ripe, with a sour taste and plenty of juice. According to legend, when Cao Cao led his army and lost their way, they were extremely thirsty and had no water. So he said, "There is a plum forest ahead, with sweet and sour fruit that can quench our thirst." The soldiers, upon hearing this, all produced water in their mouths, and they were able to reach the source of water. Its ability to generate saliva can be seen. In ancient times, they were harvested and dried in the sun to be made into ebony plums, and they were also considered a top-quality seasoning. The Book of Documents says, "If you make a seasoning, you only use plums," taking advantage of their sourness. During the Ming Dynasty, a small amount of white plum pulp was soaked in snow water, lubricating the flower dew overnight, and then soaked in honey wine. This was called "honey-soaked plum blossoms." There was also plum blossom porridge, which took fallen petals and mixed them into cooked rice porridge, and then cooked it again. There was also a method of melting wax onto half-open flowers, pouring honey into the flower mouth, and after a period of time, taking one or two flowers together with a spoonful of honey and adding them to boiling water to drink, called plum blossom soup. Yang Chengzhai has a phrase about removing the stamens and boiling them into porridge and eating them, and serving dew-covered plum blossoms with honey, which probably refers to this. However, these methods all belong to the literati's fondness for playing with elegance. In recent times, yellow and ripe plums are juiced, and then mixed with perilla and sugar to make plum jam, which does not spoil for years and can be added to bread and other items. In the hot summer, it can also be used as a cold drink. The method is to take two or three spoonfuls of plum jam and mix it with cool boiled water to drink. The sweetness and deliciousness are far superior to the fruit juice sold in the market, and it is also the most hygienic. Perilla disperses wind and cold, relieves the surface, treats summer dampness and diarrhea, stops cholera cramps, and the original intention of creating this method was actually deeply meaningful, but most people do not know it. Because I like plum water, I also like to read plum poems. However, there are very few poets who praise plums throughout the ages. I love Luo Yin's poem "Red Plum": Heaven bestowed rouge, a smear on the cheek, Among the piles, a sad melody in the flute,</p>
<p>Although I have not been able to benefit from it, I have helped generals quench their thirst. Readers, at this point, do you also feel a tantalizing taste?</p>

<h3>Launching Five Types of Social Welfare Enterprises</h3>
<p>— Xinan</p>
<p>Recently, Mr. Feng Bingnan prepared to organize a social welfare enterprise association for his mother's birthday, taking out a sum of money as subsidy funds for five categories: educators, news practitioners, religion, unemployed self-help, and health mutual insurance societies. Why did he specify these five types of enterprises first? Without him explaining his intention, there is no way to speculate. However, judging from his usual words and deeds, he is a person full of human sympathy. He often talked with friends, proposing "seeking loyalty for mankind" and "self-help, helping others, mutual help" as conversation topics. He believes that the most admirable people are those who support themselves. Therefore, he said that although the occupation of rickshaw pullers is humble, it is admirable to exchange sweat for money. The most shameful thing is to gain without labor, no matter how powerful he is, his heart and actions are extremely despicable. He believes that the most important responsibility lies with teachers and journalists, which everyone knows and does not need to be said much. However, their lives are also the most meager and the most diligent. Improving their treatment is certainly another issue, depending on their professional abilities. However, society should not ignore their contributions, nor should it only care about enjoying comfort while ignoring the people who truly make great contributions to others. It is too unfair and too cold. Although he knows that it is not easy to handle it well, he believes that what should be done should not be left undone because it is difficult. Therefore, a subsidy fund should be raised to provide some assistance to teachers and journalists who have made outstanding achievements in benefiting society and people. This kind of subsidy is not only a material reward, but also a kind of honorary award. Also, for impoverished journalists who die destitute and need to raise orphans, etc., a little subsidy should also be given. Secondly, he believes that the most painful thing in life is illness. Unless people who are truly well-off can cope, the salaries of most salary earners, no matter how much their income, have already reached the most painful stage of life. Furthermore, with the torment of illness, the physical pain is unbearable, and the mental pain is even more severe. Even without illness, one should prevent illness, and with illness, one should be even more wary. Therefore, he is determined to relieve the suffering of general salary earners from illness, so that they will not be unable to get good medical treatment when they are sick, but will be trapped by illness and become unemployed and bankrupt. He wants to design a good method so that those who join the society can get good medical treatment when they are sick, so as to avoid adding to the oppression of their painful lives. As for the unemployment problem, it occupies the top position in today's social problems, but he believes that solving this problem solely by absorbing people into the industry and relying on other people's relief is costly and ineffective. He advocates self-help and helping others, self-reliance and helping others to stand on their own. Therefore, he believes that solving the unemployment problem should start with mutual assistance among the unemployed, whether it is mutual introduction to jobs or mutual cooperation in a business, to solve their own difficulties.</p>
<p>He also has criticism for us journalists. He said: Why do current newspapers mostly publish news advertisements that promote obscenity and theft? Perhaps it is to cater to social preferences, perhaps it is for business reasons, or perhaps it is thought to have the meaning of warning against evil; but if you don't pay attention, you only see how to steal and how to be obscene, without seeing the consequences of obscenity and theft. He believes that since news about social ills cannot but be published, news about the good aspects of society should be published even more. In particular, it is necessary to advocate justice, distinguish right from wrong, promote learning, and promote morality. News about contemporary good words and deeds, loyalty and righteousness, and heroic deeds should be published more to encourage people to do good. This cannot be said to be the newspaper's partiality, as long as the facts are used to prove it. In personnel news, it is best to publish more about new scientific inventions, new industrial creations, so that people can feel interested in addition to feeling interest, and get an encouragement, so that he can hear the news and rise up, creating a good society. That is the due responsibility of journalists!</p>
<p>The above cannot be said to be the motive behind Mr. Feng Bingnan's handling of this matter, but I only know his intention as far as I have heard and seen. I think his real intention must have a day when he will formally announce it himself. As for the religious subsidy fund, he wants to promote the development of religious doctrines and improve the living forms of general religious believers, so that they will be beneficial to society, instead of taking profits from society.</p>
<h3>Amateur Chat – The Marriage Problem of White Waves</h3>
<p>— Shi Wei</p>
<p>Before our society enters rationality, society itself is flawed; therefore, people living in this society will encounter various problems.</p>
<p>Workers are the most difficult group, so they are the first to encounter all kinds of problems.</p>
<p>Today, let's talk about the marriage problem of white waves.</p>
<p>We are not Puritans, we are all people who were born after ten months. We have sexual demands in our physiology. We certainly need a fulfilling sex life.</p>
<p>However, sex life is only a part of a person's entire life. When we are fighting for the entire life today, do we necessarily need to seek the satisfaction of sex life? And can we seek satisfaction? Conversely, we cannot ignore the entire life just for the satisfaction of sex life.</p>
<p>Undeniably, among our young workers, there are many who are desperately pursuing the opposite sex, and most of them have forgotten their careers and delayed their work as a result; we feel that this tendency cannot be allowed to continue to develop. Otherwise, from a small point of view, the individual's future will be a problem. From a large point of view, it is not a blessing for the country and society.</p>
<p>We absolutely support the ideal marriage that develops from the progress of love to marriage. But we oppose the "love supremacy" that requires career to obey love!</p>
<p>History has proven, and there are thousands of people who are experimenting, that we have methods to overcome physiological "sexuality." That is: having the confidence to strive for a career, having good amateur activities to adjust, absorbing correct spiritual food... and so on.</p>
<p>By the way, some people are borrowing from the east and west to prepare for marriage, only seeing the satisfaction in front of them, without considering the life problems after marriage, which is very dangerous. On the one hand, we must try to reduce the cost of the ceremony, and on the other hand, we must ensure that the wife participates in productive work. Otherwise, won't the lively wedding ceremony become a prelude to tragedy?</p>
<p>In addition, we also support those who protest against the family due to dissatisfaction with the marriage by sale. But it should be noted that not every object arranged by parents is not good. We should try our best to strive for the opportunity to study the object, to investigate whether she (he) is good or bad, whether there is potential for development, and her (his) beliefs... and so on.</p>
<p>Acknowledgement Mr. Bai Jiao from Yunjian is proficient in epigraphy and calligraphy and has long been admired by me. From today onwards, he will be exhibiting for seven days in the Dajin Hall for connoisseurs at home and abroad to appreciate. I was honored to receive two invitation letters, giving me a feast for the eyes. I hereby express my gratitude. Started by the Spring and Autumn Editorial Department</p>
<h3>Hawthorne's Case – Where the Dancing Queen Ended Up</h3>
<p>— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter Two "A Page of History!"</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou's eyes flashed, and although Hawthorne, it seemed to indicate that there was a glimmer of light in this case. Hawthorne ignored him, but reached into his pocket and took out the two photos he had just put in. He pulled out the larger one, folded it up and gave it to Jinmei.</p>
<p>"Is this the person?"</p>
<p>Jinmei raised her eyes slightly, glanced at the photo, and nodded.</p>
<p>Hawthorne said, "What's his name?"</p>
<p>"Gan Tang – Yu Gantang."</p>
<p>Hawthorne put the photo back in his pocket. "Hey, Miss Jiang said that your person was killed by this Yu Gantang. So, did she say any reason?"</p>
<p>"No, she just said she wanted to see you."</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou looked at Hawthorne and asked, "Has the woman named Jiang seen you?"</p>
<p>Hawthorne said, "I've seen her, before you called me. She just asked me to come here to investigate immediately, and never expressed any opinion. But she promised me that we would talk more about other things later."</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou nodded. "That's good, we can ask her directly in a while."</p>
<p>Hawthorne did not answer. His eyes were still fixed on the maid's face.</p>
<p>He said again, "Jinmei, in your opinion, does Miss Jiang's words have any meaning?"</p>
<p>Jinmei hesitated again. Her right hand was playing with the buttons below the waist of the wool gabardine cheongsam, unbuttoning it for a while, and buttoning it again for a while.</p>
<p>"I can't say anything. I don't know." (31)</p>
