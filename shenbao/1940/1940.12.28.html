<p>重慶　華軍發言人所稱、明年華軍主要工作將爲加緊一切必要準備、以　最後華方對於日軍之反攻云云、已引起此間人士甚大之注意、該發言人雖未發表詳情、惟稱「一九四一年將爲中國之反攻及勝利年」、據稱華軍已增加至正規軍三百餘萬人、流動部隊一百餘萬人、更有大批新軍現在訓練中、因內地車火工業之發展、今日華軍之醒配備、已非以前可比、廣州附近之日軍力量雖稍有增加、但是吾　在粵北發動仟何大規模軍事行動、殊屬疑問云、（二十七日路透社電）</p>
<p>重慶　中國軍事發言人、本日在記者招待會席上、答覆詢問、謂中國軍備已大爲增强、將於明年大舉反攻、故一九四一年、卽稱爲「反攻年」、亦無不可、中國在去年有軍隊二百萬人、今年已達五白萬人、其中一百餘萬人爲游擊隊、軍隊之服裝配備、旣大見改進、益以連年作戰之經騐、其素質亦有長足之進步、至於前方戰事狀况、最近一星期內、僅有小接觸、並無重要發展、中國軍隊仍以擾亂日軍交通終爲事、外傳日軍擬在廣中省大舉進攻此說極不可靠、據中國軍隊所接情報、集中中山縣之日軍、正在調往他處、可知日軍無意在該方面採取攻勢云、（二十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>美國態度　益見强硬</p>
<p>東京　今晨日口新聞封而戰有消息稱、美國對日態度現益見强硬、將限遠東美人於明年一月杪、全行回國、接消息靈通方面稱、此種謠言、漸見可靠、蓋明年一月間有美船多艘將駛抵横濱、內在塔孚特總統號、將於一月三日抵埠、柯立芝總統號一月四日抵埠、披亞斯統號一月丸日抵埠、克里扶倫總統號一月十八日抵埠、往時美船駛抵横濱者、月僅一二艘而已、美國並將取經濟行動對付日本、而令美船此後不得駛經日本口岸、有以美政府一再命遠東美僑回國事詢諸日政府發言人者、　員因未接正式情報、拒絕評論此事、（二十七日路透社電）</p>
<p>日本並未　戰勝中國</p>
<p>東京　日陸軍報道班長Mabuchi大佐、撰文刊日日新聞、警吿日本民衆、對於中日事件、切弗躊躇滿志而過份樂觀、據稱、許多日人似以爲三角盟的之締結、已使國際趨勢轉而利於日本、惟余意國際大勢刻正向他方激轉、而有　於重慶政府、蓋三角公的締結後、英美卒決心援助重慶政府也、職是之故、除非將來世界大局激變、重慶政府絕無完全崩潰之望、目前中國事件複雜已極、僅恃常識判斷、不能透澈了解、日本刻正在甲國領土上、與蔣介石將軍統率之中國軍隊交戰、但中國軍隊縱吿挫敗、亦不能使現有的中日戰事得吿解決、今集合於蔣將市揭藥的旗幟下之多數華人、實代表熱愛祖國的中國人民之精萃、而站於其後者、爲援助重慶政府對日奮、以維持東亞舊秩序之英美等國、日本對於重慶抗日陣營所盡之强大努力、應完全予以承認、日人有日軍能擊敗敵人之心理、遂發生日本業已戰勝中國之感、其其實不然、今日中國人民分成兩大陣營、其一欲以和平方法、另一欲作戰到底、兩者皆謀中國之復興與獨立、關於此點、日人不應戴爲偏見與傲慢所蒙蔽之眼鏡、以視中國及其人民、日本主張建設東亞新佚序與大東亞共榮圈、其意固善、但苟非日本力是自己實行此等計劃、則一切皆虛言、日本若無實力、其與他國所訂任何條的與協定、不過一張廢紙而已、此已由德國予以證明、今非日人斤斤以求私利之時、而須竭力推進、以謀中　事件之解決、並加速重整軍備、與擴張生產能力、俾能建立防務特强之國家云、（二十七日路透社電）</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>促投機者反省</h3>
<p>昨日本報所載耶誕之夜，消耗於舞塲酒排間等不下百萬元，而街頭露斃爲普善山莊所收殮者亦不下一百六十餘具，兩者相形，謂爲上海社會矛盾之深刻，其誰曰不宜。雖然，此百萬所費，僅圖一夕之歡，而不知連日之酒食徵逐餽遺所費，又寗止數百萬元！街頭露斃，僅見所收殮者如是而已，而因飢寒交迫，營養不足因病以死者，又不知若干萬人，街頭躑躅，沿路求乞已是無一路無一地，莫不見有若輩之踪跡矣；而踡伏於草棚破屋之中，啼號於破席冷竈之旁者，又不知有無其數之人也。上海之爲天堂，爲地獄：其爲塵世間最佚樂歡笑之一隅，抑爲悲凉悽慘之絕境，冷觀者固知之，醉生夢死者髯小念及之乎？鳴呼？此固都市社會之奇形異狀，而亦社會病熊與人情道德末由改造所成之惡果也。</p>
<p>今年之物價，殆爲中國有史以來所未有：而今年之生活，乃亦中國人民所罕有之遭遇。一方面但見投機分子之各方活動，莫不囊槖豐滿，揮霍無度，而另一方面固無一不悉索所有，猶虞不給。以言街頭之流浪者良苦矣，風餐露宿，惟待行人之惠施。瓦屋貧民之生活，宜彼善於此矣；而不知求乞則礙於顏面，吿貸則誰爲將伯，隆冬歲暮，猶是衣單褲薄，炊烟四起，正愁柴窮糧盡。蓋以一元一升米，一元一斤油，大小五口之家，日有二三元之收入，僅堪饘粥度日，衣着等　有所不暇兼顧矣。疾病之來，仗原有抵抗之力與病魔相周旋，醫藥所資，無所挹注矣。彼其平時寗不作仰事俯蓄之計：惟其所蓄積，已爲今日投機奸商强梁巨猾，所壓迫，所榨取，所吮吸殆盡。彼之收益，寗不較戰事前稍有增加。然所增有限，而物價之上漲無垠，以有限之薪津，遇無垠之物價，鮮不顚覆隨之，此高物價所以促成社會之普遍貧窮也。</p>
<p>滬上人士，寗不念貧窮之無告，惟其愈富厚者常不知貧窮之艱苦，此亦其處境使然，蓋所居高樓大廈寗知草棚之中尙有擱樓，以供棲宿者乎？席間肥鮮珍饈，又寗知終日不得一飽，殘肴剩飯，有求之不得者乎？紅爐生春，水汀禦寒，尙知有抖顫於寒天雪地之中，僅剩全身之熱血體溫，與寒浪相搏擊者乎？雖然，固謂滬人士非盡麻木也未嘗不作人之好善，誰不如吾之想，以是存心，行善者雖以今年之貧窮，夐甚於往年，而今年之救濟，乃亦超越於去歲。單就粥票而論，目前發行之團體，不下十餘處，善團定購者，不下六萬張。其他發售平飯者二三處。施送棉衣者，則有各善團集中施送，亦有分投散放，或則專事救濟隱貧。慈聯會又循去年例，散放饅首薑湯；復有人施送饅首券乃至米票等類，足證辦埋冬振之踴躍，然此猶不免爲消極之救濟，不能弭治安之隱患，拯人類於困境，故積極方面，仍在於物價之平準及耀振之繼續舉辦也。</p>
<p>平準物價，最大之困難，在於貨運之節節阻隔，凡一涉足於淪陷區，鷄非宰，蛋非煮熟，布非裁製，不能携帶，乃至於製成之衣，隨身之物，香烟火柴之屬，動遭扣留沒收，上海之貨物不得入淪陷區，淪陷區之貨物，亦不易入上海，甚至淪陷區與淪陷區之間，其種種留難亦如之。於是貨運失其流通之便，供求失其調節之效，各地之物價無不貴，各地之民生無不艱，身受之苦痛，蓋有甚於上海居民者也。然而上海民食已深受其累矣，麥爲所統制不能來，米爲所搜刮不能來，所幸者洋米之販運自如也。洋粉洋麥之輸入無虞中輟也。棉爲所壟斷，紗爲所操縱，布爲所挾制，衣着固重要，但敝舊經縫紉補綴固無傷於大雅，以是其嚴重不若民食之甚。滬上之米商、動輒以內地糧價藉爲口實，而不念內地米價之昂貴，一則由於人口突然加增，再則內地本不產米，而平添許多食米之人，安得而不求過於供。三則內地糧食之輸入，沿海一帶、已爲日艦所封鎖，而內地接近淪陷區產米之區，復需與日軍相爭取，而上海洋米來源，幾可謂無日不有。故內地米價貴，尙有其情之可恕，然而囤積糧食者尙處以死刑。上海糧價之貴，全爲囤戶挾其屢博屢進之雄厚資力，以與民食爲仇也。假使米價長此高昂，乃至於一般人不能如平時之購食，則疾病發出，康衢荆棘，亦必有以上海非樂土矣。故今日最所急需者，爲平準一般民生所必需之物品，而唯一之關鍵，又在如何協力排除富前之障碍。投機商人，宜作退一步想，全社會皆貧窮，爾等獨富，亦將感覺富之　爲福。盍不於此時際，籌自全之策，莫作過分之誅求，全一般垂絕之生計？則東隅雖逝，桑楡禾謂晚也。</p>

<h3>德蘇大軍調動頻繁　巴爾幹局勢嚴重　德軍二十師經匈開羅　或將於明春有所舉動</h3>
<p>匈京　德蘇大軍今晨尙在調動中、聯機械化增强部隊、正沿布魯特河左岸布陣、同時德軍數萬由匈入羅、聞正向各方展開、德軍之此項調動、表示德在希首將有事於巴爾幹、或竟影響蘇聯戰略之地位、乃至保南希土之前途亦未可知、在羅之德國標準軍隊已在速迅擴張、據各方估計、將擴張至二十萬與五十萬之間、巴爾幹方面消息至少達三十萬、擁有坦克車重砲以及其他戰具之紅軍沿布魯特河駐於蘇羅邊界、配備雄厚之德軍分遣隊、傳正粉粉開往毘連保南之羅邊各區、保南二國已大受威脅、（二十日國際社電）</p>
<p>匈京　昨傳蘇聯因德調大軍入羅、故亦正在加强比薩拉比亞與波聞東部各邊區之紅軍駐屯軍、並擴大各該邊區之砲隊與飛機隊、以與德軍對峙、此項消息、係由旅客傳至此間者、按自德調大軍三十萬至五十萬入羅後、衆信巴爾幹方面此項迅速擴大之德軍、似將在新年有所舉動、因而影響蘇聯乃至保南希土、今蘇聯增兵消息傳來、此種信念於是益强、經由匈國乘火車而入羅國之德國標準軍隊逐漸增加至五十萬人後、羅國實已完全屬於德國軍事控制之下、巴爾幹整個局勢緊張益甚、殊有破裂之虞、關於德軍在羅擴大之眞正動機與目的、外間傳說紛紛、外交界方面猜測、希特勒元首終不克於假道保南攻擊希臘之薩洛尼加區以援助墨索里尼、果爾則希氏將冒土國反響之險、蓋土曾警告在先、勿容色雷斯區遭受侵犯也、又有人以爲前會傳蘇聯要求完全控制多瑙河各口、德蘇關係因是而緊張、此次德軍之行動、或與此事有關、（二十七日國際社電）</p>

<p>紐約　美國某通訊社匈京訪電稱、德軍約二十師有機械化部隊完全設備者、現乘火車穿過匈境而赴羅國絡繹不斷云、又一消息謂德國軍用卡車一千輛已抵特里斯特、以便分配與義軍、（二十七日路透電）</p>
<p>倫敦　紐約所傳德國出兵經過匈境之說、昨日此間官塲聲稱、未有附聞、（二十七日路透電）柏林權威納粹官員昨日極力否認外國所傳蘇德在羅馬尼亞發生困難之消息、渠等謂此等消息乃「外國宣傳家破壞兩國關係之例行企圖」云、（二十七日合衆電）</p>
<p>蘇菲亞　觀察家指出希特勒對於蘇俄烏克蘭之領土野心、未必卽已放棄、德國以羅馬尼亞爲根據地、而向烏克蘭實施閃電戰、或竟發生於一月間、彼時大地堅凍、頗宜於機械隊之作戰、希特勒之戰術常有驚人之舉、不可以常理限之也云云、（二十七日合衆電）</p>
<h3>德軍增兵羅境　消息震動全歐</h3>
<p>斯丹埠　新自羅馬尼亞回土耳其之某方面稱、大批德國新軍開抵羅馬尼亞之事、在國際極有重大意義、羅國當局先此並未預料德國將於駐軍四萬二千人之外、再增加任何人數、德軍現駐於波蘭之蘇俄邊境至少有七十師、但如果自德國加調軍隊往波蘭南部、亦有假道匈牙利之可能、因波蘭南境之鐵道極爲陳舊也、（廿七日合衆社電）</p>
<p>紐約　德軍大隊向羅馬尼亞調動之傳聞、昨已震盪全歐、除外交界之消息謂、匈牙利之各火車每列必遇到四小時至七小時外、其餘歐洲各大城並無官方消息足以證明此事者、柏林正式極力否認德軍經由匈牙利開人羅馬尼亞、保京正式否認任何德軍曾進入保加利亞、羅京之情報長吿合衆社稱、最近開抵匈牙利中東部捷米斯瓦地方之德軍、不過擴充該處之駐軍而已、又據情報稱、「德國似不至於在巴爾幹尤其希臘及土耳其發動軍事行動」合衆社訪員被禁發表最近抵達提米斯瓦之德軍數目云、（廿七日合衆社電）</p>

<p>銀樓飾金每兩兌出價、上午九點一刻升十元、十二點回落十元、午後無上落、結果大同行掛六百七十元、新同行與上價相仿、收進低三十元光景、</p>
<h3>外匯漸鬆</h3>
<p>外匯昨日市况、匯豐掛牌、悉無上落、英美匯暗市、續趨鬆動惟晨開後一小時內、因投機興趣濃厚、需要仍多、致價緊縮、下月份美匯成交、俱為五元三七五、不久匯豐及日行等均寨、並聞出口商有售、逐漸回硬、後市續鬆、投機商進出平平、但為狀終硬、收盤英金告三辦士四八四三七五、美十五元五三一二五、結果比週二晚收英美各長〇四六八七五、〇九三七五、</p>

<p>香港申匯昨下降</p>
<p>香港二十七日（週五）電、今晨匯市開盤告平、英美日各匯均無變動、申匯現貨降二元、為四百三十元十時二十五分、申匯現貨回升三元、為四百三十三元、十一時三十分告平、各匯槪無上落、十一時四十五分、申匯現貨回降三元、為四百三十元、下午二時三十分開盤平定、申匯現貨再降三元、為四百二十七元、其餘不動、</p>
<p>天津匯市甚平穩</p>
<p>天津二十一日（週五）電、今晨匯市開盤呆滯、倫敦及紐約電匯比假前均無榮辱、申匯升一元、為九十元「聯鈔」暗盤昂一元半、為八十六元、</p>
<p>外幣亦回</p>
<p>昨日外幣市况、烚赤市價、疾進猛退、英美金鎊價亦係先漲後跌、終落一元、英金票呆定如故、市價站平、美金票始曾高至十九元、但旋卽步落、卒為十八元二角七分、比假前計跌三角三分、香港票供給稍旺、市價疲弱、坎拿大及菲列濱票均稍趨軟、日金票供給稍旺、晚市略退為一元六角一分、朝鮮票需要不稀、晚市高至一元三角四分、</p>
<h3>證券　內債甲乙　均見新高價</h3>
<p>公債暗盤、昨市忽有畸形意外的發展、甲乙均發見新高價、但惜不旋踵而遽小半元、原因同康大批買進、意在軋緊頭寸、但以為力無多、逢高有利卽行結出、此種無所謂之漲風、是否尚有繼續性、殊難預測、九六因北帮頗有吸收、本輕利重、前途當尙有進展、昨日上午同康買進首屈一指、德孚但孚次之、聯和為殿、散戶更推波助瀾、市價乃逐步上漲、毫無回顧、遽好起一元二三角、鼎康怡泰及生大乃得善價而沽、午復聯和德孚繼續買進、生大補回、協康震長買進、甲乙乃又發見新高價、但以鼎康怡泰繼續賣出、同康轉賣、鴻大順昌厚大均有了結、遽丙種四元六角高價驟至四元收盤、甲種抬出四元、復又回進、此次漲風、脚地不實、恐不易維持不墜耳、市價結果、一致上漲三角至一元四角、成交約有三百萬元左右、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交南洋兄弟兄弟烟草公司股三百股、價為二十元零七角半、上漲甚勁、聞該公司今年盈餘可二百數十萬元云、</p>
<p>又眾業公所股市、開盤平穩、嗣因補空、價格上趨、近收盤時、各股騰踊益烈、蓋眾預料、新歲市面必開高盤也、交易最盛之股、有揚子、國際英聯、怡和紗廠怡和啤酒、會德豐等、俱以高價收盤、橡皮股收盤時亦受實業股影響、堅挺非凡、</p>
<p>倫敦二十六日（週四）電、今日中國外債及遠東英商各公司股票掛牌行市、均告平滯、祇匯豐銀行英倫註冊股降落三鎊、價為七十五鎊、其餘均無變動、</p>
<h3>紗花　紗市狂漲疾退　上下有四十餘元</h3>
<p>紗市起伏龐大、益呈猛進疾退局面、此完全多空兩方意志不一之故也、初以賣方惶恐、紛起扒補、繼聞盈利者吐出、乃外匯轉長、黃金下落、於是籌碼稍鬆懈、空頭又復活躍、浮多痛新市盤乃山昂轉弱矣、據市塲傳言「外客方面」意態仍然寗靜也、二十支雙馬新高峯皆見一千四百三十三元、低價敲破四百元大關、為一千三百九十一元、今日有棉紗四百八十件運香港、</p>
<p>雙馬晨開、因上日人氣堅挺、而空頭急乎抵補、首盤價為一千四百十五元、此盤一開、買戶接踵而來、賣方難以應付、直升至一千四百三十三元、旋以獲利者了結、價况略鬆、回落至一千四百十六元、但外匯開出微縮一檔、市况又復轉昂、再升至一千四百二十八元、中途聞投機多頭了結較夥、一時形勢轉挫、市盤迥旋而下、時近十二時已過、塲中趨勢大變、謂傳言紛紜、多說外匯要看放長、浮戶賣聲振盪、市價直下至一千三百九十四元、查半日間成交統計六千一百零五包、行情二十支雙馬跌十五元、茲將各帮口買去之額量、分列如左同行六、（〇〇〇）香港一〇五統計六、一〇五　　午後紗市始昂繼平、二十支雙馬、先做一千四百元、繼後為一千三百九十二元、有人要進、又做一千四百元、卒後價一千三百九十五元、</p>
<h3>棉市安靜如常</h3>
<p>現棉情情况予上日不相上下、但廠方需要不旺、執貨者仍無遷就售意、所以市態安靜如常耳、</p>
<p>另訊外棉市價、紐約棉市堅定、先因棉區氣候報告之惡劣、後又因同業之購買、結果收盤價格、較之上日漲起五六磅音、印度停市、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、日來因匯兌之緊縮、廠方頗有購意、而同業不願廉價出售、因之交易靜寂、然按照棉市之趨勢、棉價始終看漲也、</p>
<h3>糧食　米市沉寂　價見小修</h3>
<p>洋米昨日略形回平、緣自停止掮客入塲後、投機交易頓見沉寂、而浮多散戶亦有隨市求脫且有某號售碎米一千數百包、照七十六元限價脫手、兼以公倉存米已在進行、定貨亦在疏運、人心轉平、現貨市價已削小一元左右、但市上售開照限貨仍屬中次各檔、若西貢等高貨限價者、依然擯不出樣、故全日現米交易紙二千多包、期貨僅有小絞開出二百噸、計十二月九十五元半、一月份八十七元一角、一月下八十八元、價亦比前市小一元許、</p>
<p>厚薄更察國米及糯米稍有做開、但以人心已虛、銷塲並淡、故售價　貶元許、計崑山斛見白粳自一百元至九十七元、青角斛見薄稻開九十二元至九十元、原包九十六元、糯米際此環境、一致帶疲、宣溧國元已售九十四五元、香港白元八十四五元、較前市亦落元許、</p>
<h3>巨額坎粉成交　囤戶進胃漸懈</h3>
<p>麵粉　昨日洋粉市情、先聚後平、上午開盤頗堅、因華粉供應日蹙、洋粉已成為本客必需之品、一般行商、堅執如常、聞本客方面購進花神牌澳紛二千餘包、價二十二元九角五分、及花烏鐘樓牌粉五千餘包、價二十二元七角半、旋聞糧商方面新定坎拿大洋粉二船、每桶美金四元五角、一二月份裝船、市塲人心、聞此巨額定粉成交後、囤戶進胃較懈、晚市形勢漸鬆、至於平賣粉則照常維持至年終為止、明年一月份新辦法、當視洋麥來源如何再為酌定云、</p>
<p>小麥　昨小麥趨勢仍堅、華廠久無相當進取、日廠則注意吸收期貨、聞中國火車麥價三十元至二十九元半、由行商拋與三鑫廠約一萬包、而市塲喊價殊昂、尙須三十二三元、並無妥交、</p>
<h3>油餅　油市囤戶支持</h3>
<p>昨日油市因環境鬆動、人心軟化、市價在黃豆趨勢下游之情形下、雖由一部份囤戶强行支持、但大局無神、結果仍跌、計成父膠州生油一百五十件、價為九十四元至九十三元、新貨一百件價為九十四元五角、大連豆油一百桶、價為一百十五元七角半、一月上交二百桶、價為一百十六元二角半、一月下交一百桶、價為一百十七元二角半、二月上交三百桶、價為一百十八元五角、大有廠豆油一百五十担、價為九十三元五角至九十三元云、</p>
<p>今日　豆子二千三百八十包、一豆餅一萬五千八百二十塊、芝蔴一百包、蔴油六百五十聽、生仁八百包、生油三千四百廳、均運往香港、</p>
<h3>疋頭　棉布所漲過暴　客銷遂見停頓</h3>
<p>廠布　昨市晨漲午回、蓋初時人氣熱烈、各貨開價一致報漲、每疋計漲五角至七角半、惟客銷實需仍呆本街批發號因辦理年關結賬手續、已截止放賬、除待銷之貨外、均暫緩添配、而新雜鈔有延期發行之傳說、市氣轉淡、散戶爭脫、售盤步趨回跌、結果與耶誕前頗少軒輊、本街成交各布四百餘件、粵港帮辦漂染布粗布斜紋一百餘件、浙東溫甬台帮辦粗布漂布等近百件、北路烟台帮辦重磅雙象等牌組布七八十包、</p>
<p>東布　晨開因紗市狂升、漲風殊健、十二磅龍頭細布售四十三元二角、後以標金回降、紗價亦落、布市實銷貨之中檔細布、又露呆滯之狀、業外浮多吐售、價乃步軟、至午收盤為四十二元五六角、後市續跌至四十一元九角收盤、四君子嗶嘰一元二角〇五區、</p>
<p>出口　棉布今（廿八日）有一千一百元五十件、運往香港、</p>
<h3>春夏二季呢絨　大有成交</h3>
<p>淡色春薄花呢薄素嗶嘰、中西裝衣料各種春貨、派力司·羽紗呢·萬而頂·哈維呢·法蘭絨等諸夏貨、日來莫不大有成交、同業各號、囤吸之心均濃、其主要原因、今年獲和齊較去年為尤眾、銀根充裕、兼存底不多、廠盤報漲、外匯見縮定到艱難、與有長江將可開放、客路一動、呢絨必多鬧荒、後市貨價必更上漲所放耳、</p>
<h3>色子貢呢下降</h3>
<p>元色子貢禮服呢、前因市貨軋缺、求過於供、行情於是曾先後報漲二三次、西洋貨趨勢特別俏貴、最近來市氣、則齊多下降轉疲、因東貨有到埠、國產寅豐大陸廠均有產出、隨成供需平衡、其有執存者、均成無奇可居矣、昨福泰元色子貢呢、每碼售四十五元、寅豐財神虎二十八元、大陸一本萬利二十五元、</p>
<h3>糖市　糖價平定</h3>
<p>昨糖市趨勢轉平、上落無幾、公會劃盤、現貨二四組白外棧七十九元四角、微升一角、荷赤現貨六十四元二角至六十四元、本棧六十四元九角、本月底打單六十四元五角至四角、太古車白B嘜西棧仍七十八元半、本月底交割七十八元一角、DY嘜西棧新貨七十七元二角HX嘜七十六元八角至七十七元、微見回升、國糖叫價雖增、但受手寥寥、因各路運出為難所政、</p>
<h3>糖市上漲　原因不一</h3>
<p>近日糖市、上升甚速、俱創見新高價、二十四日二四粗白見八十一元、荷赤見六十五元半、公會進多出少、大有糖荒之象、茲探得其原因如後、</p>
<p>（一）劃本見高、荷糖以美金結價、近日美匯轉縮、故糖價新定見高、故如匯價回長、糖價亦必見鬆、（二）全市存底約七萬包左右、雖到貨絡繹、但去路亦旺、迄未能將存底增厚、（三）時近舊歷年關、本街日銷約二千包、不無鼓動市氣、（四）糖商作偽、每以生粉和入糖內、以圖漁利、今則生粉價在八十餘元、竟駕糖價而上之、故糖市看高一步者頗不乏人、（五）往昔糖市、時因日糖廉價傾銷、致將市價壓住、今年日糖進口甚鮮、近日日商反在市收進粗白約在萬包以上、用意不明、（六）因日商突起收買、遂有人說海關或將增稅、亦有謂長江或將開放、但亦不可信、惟日商有採辦、乃有種種謠諑、疑神疑鬼也、（華强却酬）</p>
<h3>南北貨　金菜開新高價</h3>
<p>金菜邇來到貨旣少、而號貨又扳緊少出、故市勢一再上展、漲風正勁、迄未稍已、昨頂莊菜又見新高峯、開至一百二十元、其餘中次檔因亦隨升、照各方需要活動而論、尙防續緊、　　藥材　苦參子漲廿元　　苦參子因到貨　乏、市上存底漸感缺乏、但近日各幫頗有去胃、在市搜購價乃上漲、比之本月初旬行市、前後須升二十碼之多、</p>
<h3>絲茶　廠經最近斯紀錄　售五千元</h3>
<p>聖誕節後之國外絲市、依然平淡、計紐約方面近期較開關前末市小一分五、橫濱及其餘紐約絲市仍開原盤、本市絲情、因最近受一新中央銀行」之影響、是故外匯緊縮、絲價暴漲、昨日怡和達昌等洋行成交五十包、白廠絲78％二〇—二二售開五〇〇〇元、較本月初相差四〇〇元之多、此種價格、乃最近數月來之最高紀錄也、</p>
<h3>五金　青鉛鐵動銷</h3>
<p>青鉛鐵市面、日來頗覺活躍、因熱水瓶廠製坯廠等相繼吸進、（均因時令關係）目為數可觀、因而市况熱鬧、人心隨外匯緊縮而高昂、行盤頗覺挺秀、昨市如會司貨每二百磅開一百四十元、而　連板則每箱一百五十元、均各漲起五六元、交易除本街廠家外、外帮生意亦有動、聞天津帮及長江路客商納胃均展、故預料來日趨勢當更許樂觀耳</p>
<p>、</p>
<h3>煤炭　鴻基屑加價　每噸漲十三元</h3>
<p>鴻基二號白煤屑、前月藉口水脚猛漲、曾一度加價、煤球因之亦水漲船高、廠盤抬上、不意日昨貨方乘日來外匯緊縮、二號屑同業拆價又加十三元、每噸由一百五十五元、漲至一百六十八元、其他次等屑如新鴻屑、古拔屑亦一致抬上云、</p>
<h3>經濟叢談</h3>
<p>— 馮柳堂</p>
<p>紙烟</p>
<p>紙烟是機製品，更見其為外國流入的人，亦稱為香銀，以其香味較任何烟為佳的緣故，大槪吸愼的方式，雅片最麻繁，須側臥曲躬，亦最費事，一烟泡之微，以至上斗燒吸，非數分鐘不辦。</p>
<p>水烟較雅片為省事，但仍須有水烟袋，須裝烟低吹，燒烟，去烟蒂，種種手續亦不見得便利。早烟可云最便利了，但以烟斗小，容烟不多，且烟味亦無紙烟之佳，携帶復無紙烟之便，蓋至少須有尺許長之烟袋，及烟荷包等物。因之紙烟之便利，允推獨步，旣不必定須烟管，而且一烟在口，兩手仍可照常工作，行住坐臥，無往不宜，卒致窮鄉僻壤，無遠弗屆。（未完）</p>

<h3>工部局決定召開　納稅外僑特別會　局方建議自明年一月起　加市政總捐百分之四十</h3>
<p>工部局董事會昨（廿七）日舉行例會、決定明年一月廿三日召開納稅外僑特別大會、考量自明年一月一日起、按照現行市政總捐（卽百分之十八外、加附加費百分之五十、）及地稅之徵收率、加徵附加費百分之四十、並另訂各項執照之收費率、按現行市政總捐為百分之廿七、地稅為百分之一、三五、按照新辦法、將自明年一月一日起、同時加徵附加費百分之四十、</p>
<h3>西貢撤消米禁示　該地米價下降仰光更廉　米市從嚴監督米商畏懼</h3>
<p>本市所需大宗食米、大部份來自西貢、况該地產價、係依歸本市米價、茲本市各種洋米市價業經評定限價、並切實執行、該項消息已傳諸西貢等地、故該地米商、以滬市米價旣經評定、若再扳緊原價、或再遞增、則滬市米商定以無法獲利、乃致裹足不前、轉向他處採辦、關係西貢米商營業不無影饗、一般人心由堅轉軟、市價已趨下降、茲大陸報云、據昨日商界消息、西貢方面已撤銷一號西貢米禁止出口之禁令、西貢米八萬包、巳在來滬途中、此舉對本市米市、將有良好影響、</p>
<p>仰光每担價五十元</p>
<p>昨接米業界透露消息、目下仰光米價、每担合值國幣僅五十元左右、該項米糧、質地雖不　暹羅西貢兩地所產米糧為佳、然價值終比上述二項米糧為廉、如能大批運滬、亦係穩定民食之唯一治本辦法、運米船隻雖感缺乏、聞有關方面在積極設法、期增加班次、俾能大量運滬、誠為際斯米價上漲、米蠧藉口成本重大之一反證也、</p>
<p>改革米市須有恒心</p>
<p>昨晨市塲開做後、盛傳一月初旬可有十萬餘包貢米抵埠、囤戶大感不安、誠恐市價猛降、遭受意外損失、故高檔米糧已見貨樣、無論國洋米糧、均較前市每担下降元許、全市成交統達二千餘包、並據熟悉米市之某氏聲稱、歷次改革米市塲之處置、以此次較為嚴格、良以市塲中旣無投機份子傳播謠言、及代替業外人收購米糧、則市塲交易均以實銷為原則、如再能在來源方面極力疏通、則市價可望無甚大之變動、惟此項措置、須持之以恒、方能奠米市於穩定之途、若陡見米市暫趨穩定、即顧念被摒於塲外少數人之利益、而撤銷限制入塲之措置、則投機份子又得重行滲入市塲、殊非本市民食之福利、甚望關係方面注意及之、</p>
<p>八期平糶共十五天</p>
<p>自米價高漲後、本埠數萬貧民、咸望第八期平糶早日實現、茲據大中社記者向平糶委員會探悉、該會向外洋產區所訂購之三萬包碎米、卽將運抵本埠、八期平糶、至遲於一月五日左右當可舉辦、又悉、平糶日期、約計十五天、因各米號至廢層年終時、須辦理結束、故將平糶日期、予以縮短</p>
<h3>越界築路捐稅糾紛　談判有待</h3>
<p>近傳有所謂「市政府滬西稽徵處」者、分函滬西越界築路區兩旁一百米突以內之中外工廠、要求「徵稅」、查洋涇浜地皮章程、規定離越界築路區一百米突以內之區域、其捐稅均歸工部局徵收、記者昨日特以此事詢諸工部局捐務處、據該處某高級職員對記者稱、目下滬西越界築路區之捐稅糾紛、一時尙不能解決、須至「聯合警權「之警務協定簽訂後、方能開始談判、近數月來、某方已迭派一收稅人」至該區圖收捐稅、渠雖未接獲詳細報告、但據所知、該區已有若干納稅人、旣向工部局納稅外、復向某方繳稅、此為彼等自願損失、工部局自無法干涉、</p>

<p>南進聲中</p>

<h3>温州米荒風潮　擊斃多命　寗紹各縣災情亦重　鄞縣行二粥一飯制</h3>
<p>據大通社記者探悉、溫州在浙東、素以產米著稱、最近亦鬧米荒、人民亦購米無着、轉向縣府請願、被武裝團隊開槍射擊、傷斃多人、民衆發生紛擾、搗毀府坡殿巷陳卓生·百里坊唐伯寅、城南鎭長張汝舟等士紳住宅、</p>

<p>寗紹兩屬亦極嚴重</p>
<p>此外如寗屬各縣、如鄞縣業已厲行二粥一飯制、並推行擴充種植冬作及雜糧、一面向浙贛產米各地、採辦食米接濟、惟據估計、該縣食糧、祇能維持至明年二月、在春夏之交、將為民食嚴重困離時期、鎭海縣業已發生鬧荒、現由滬鎭兩地同鄉士紳、向鄞縣辦米接濟、</p>
<p>省方救濟緩不濟急</p>
<p>其餘如慈谿·奉化·紹興·各縣、莫不感食糧缺之尤以紹興、適當兵災之後、糧食恐慌、異常嚴重、餓殍載道、情形悲慘、雖省方巳在統籌調劑、並派經濟團分赴各地視察徵詢、然緩不濟急、</p>

<h3>煤球抬價</h3>
<p>煤球廠盤曾評定價格、卽每噸不得超過一百四十元、惟一部份較大煤球廠竟陽舉陰違、置若罔聞、故竟將所持煤球所需煤屑提高市價、藉口製造煤球成本加重、爰將煤球市價抬高至每噸一百六十元、茲因受外匯緊縮影響、市塲人心不無囂張、若輩煤商利用機位、堅藏現貨不肯輕易脫手、昨日煤市開做後、人心愈趨惶恐、結果煤球市價卒被抬高八元一噸、現廠盤已漲至一百六十八元、門市每噸已達一百八十元、即每担（一百市斤）九元、惟據新聲社記者探悉、現今運滬煤屑皆係低價時所成交、目前外匯鬆縮二於煤屑市價毫無關係、然煤商竟乘機抬價、其居心誠不可測也、况現下各廠製造煤屑並非完令鴻基煤屑、內中僅及少數、大部份則為產自台灣之赫凌層、該項煤屑來價頗廉、並質地較遜、望煤球公會及有關當局予以注意及之、勿再旁觀、俾解平民倒懸、</p>

<p>十二月三十一日為國曆年終、各銀行對商業儲蓄兩部、均已分別結算利息、並定是日對內延長辦公時間、趕結各賬、一月一日至三日日雖為新年例假、各行對內則照常辦公、錢業結賬向根據農曆年終、國曆年終僅辦理普通結算而已、至於各工廠公司行號、凡採用新式會計者、則以國層年終為結賬、惟事實上什九根據農曆年終結賬、</p>

<p>舞廳認係微小事件</p>
<p>惟昨晨盛傳互毆時、有義軍下士一名喪生、或受重創、關於此說、未能從此間義當局方面獲得否認或證實之訊、又大滬舞廳副經理希勒來函、謂耶誕節前夕之事、僅係微小之紛擾、而某舞女被擲落銅鼓上及義水兵一名、受頭撞鋼琴之惡待兩說、亦非事實、</p>
<p>義軍或將賠償損失</p>
<p>大滬舞廳現正要求賠償互毆時傢俱之損壞二均計二千元、及顧客四散未付之賬款五千元、據美第四陸戰隊軍官稱、美當局並不承付賠款、眾信義當局對於此事、已表歉意、而將負担賠款、</p>
<p>當時情狀甚為緊張</p>
<p>聞美義兵開始互毆時、舞廳內約有顧客一千五百人之多、見狀紛紛　塲、頓時大亂、出廳頗為困難、而混戰方酣時、甫離大光明戲院之雷影觀眾、多聞大滬舞廳傳出乓乒之聲、毆擊情形、諒甚激烈、聞受傷士兵至少二十五人、美當局謂受傷美兵皆已出醫療室、惟義兵傷勢如何、未能確悉、</p>

<p>我常奇怪人類為什麼要寫歷史？當腓得烈大帝叫人來讀歷史給他聽的時候，他說。「叫說謊的人來。」歷史是謊言，為什麼要寫牠？大歷史家吉朋又說：「歷史不過記錄了人類的罪行，愚笨，多不幸。」歷史是刑事檔案，為什麼把牠公佈出來？</p>
<p>歷史固然是堆毫無價值的滓渣嗎，我說不。</p>
<p>你知道歷史怎樣造成的？歷史由兩個相對勢力激盪成的。。一個勢力代表眞理，正義，道德；而另一個代表邪惡，欺騙。這兩個勢力不息衝突，搏鬥，人類就向前進步。人類的進步是艱難的，因為歷史是血的產物二</p>
<p>這樣，歷史不是叫我們去看，而是叫我們去做的。只有懦弱的人才高興看歷史，當然，結果使他難受一頓，為了他看到過去的錯誤。勇敢的人是去做，是去創造歷史。威兩莫特說得好：「歷史代表詩與小說最愉快的塲而，叙事詩的莊嚴，戲劇的動人情節，傳奇的驚駭與敎訓。」創造歷史多有價值，因為牠就是進步。看歷史叫人消沉，年老；但創造歷史叫人興奮，年靑。朋友，你翻開歷史，千萬不要把牠富本死書讀，而是一架號筒，這樣呼喚你。振起臂膀，跟惡勢力去鬥，你要去創造！」</p>
<p>希臘戰士創造勝利的戰果，就是由馬拉松的史蹟鼓舞起來的。</p>

<h3>我混了十年</h3>
<p>— 李敏</p>
<p>朋友，我想告訴你，在這樣的情形下，我混過了＋年。</p>
<p>十年是個悠長的時間呀！</p>
<p>然而我有什麼法子呢？每天看天亮到黑暗，黑暗至光明，就這樣兜着生活的圈子，漸漸，我也變成蒼老了。</p>
<p>你是知道的，我十四歲就吃這行飯，可是我現在是一個二十三歲的人了，二十三歲該是達到討老婆的時期了吧，但我從那兒說起呢？</p>
<p>早晨聽見汽笛的嗚叫，我需要上工去，晚上拖着屍壳似的身軀，倒上床也就算了。其實也並不這樣簡單，中間不知有多少事情需要我的力，不知多少事情需要我的腦，而腦與力並用外，還加上吃廠長的「排頭」。</p>
<p>廠長是一個膽怯而多疑的人，但當他每餐酒吃過後，他會說很潑辣不講理的話。我們不願去見他的面，然而往往被生活逼迫，不得不去向他說情</p>
<p>有一次，我為着我的弟弟瘡開刀，向廠長去借錢；廠長正當吃過黃酒，醉勳勳的。我說明借錢的理由，但是他發火了，他：</p>
<p>「誰管你們一家門！」</p>
<p>可是我總不能讓弟弟生了瘡而痛苦，甚至死去。難道父親死去後，這些哥哥的責任都不要負嗎？然而我終於忍受了憤怒，幾次三翻地懇求，最後廠長責我平時費用了太大，狠虎虎地簽了一個字借給我二十＋塊錢。</p>
<p>其實二十塊錢够醫院裏用嗎？那是很難說了。</p>
<p>廠裏的職員彷彿都過着「太平世界」，空閒時不談女人，就說「馬雀」經，有時雖然也嘆口氣，說生活程度太高了，不過他們不慮到廠方，祇寃自己命運不好。</p>
<p>眞的命運不好嗎，我不明白。</p>
<p>不過我想起來命運終究是空虛的，十年來這樣混着，難道一些些運的路都沒有嗎？一</p>
<p>所以，有時我憎恨我父親，為什麼不讓我多讀些書，否則總比在黑暗的工廠中混着好些。</p>
<p>然而這到底也是多餘的，社會沒有改革之前，吃人的制度永遠會存留下去。</p>
<p>但是在現今的生活程度下，我眞的混不過去了，十年，雖然混過，但在十一年的開頭，我已不能這樣混了。</p>
<p>你恐怕還不知道我幾塊一月工錢吧。朋友，我僅有十塊錢一月，加上現在所謂生活津貼，也不過二十塊錢。這二十塊錢一月你說叫我用到那裏去呢？廠長罵我太浪費，這眞是寃枉了，米買一百元一擔，煤球八元一擔，我家裏有母親弟弟，飯該是要吃的。房屋也該是要住的罷，然而我二十塊錢作什麼用呢？買二斗米，二十塊錢已完了，別的怎麼辦呢？</p>
<p>我迷惘，我懷疑；廠中把貨物都漲了價，為什麼我們的工錢不加呢，</p>
<p>我痛苦地混過十年，現在不能再混下去了！</p>

<p>— 顧明道</p>
<p>錢牧齋徐徐立起身來，說道：「卿言未嘗不是，我就和你去殉國吧。」柳如是遂和錢牧齋一同走下樓來。牧齋的嗣子和女兒以及衆家人都在一旁伺候，莫不含着眼淚。錢牧齋柳如是心裏各有非常的難過。先至香案前親自拈香，拜過先皇帝，又祭拜自己的祖先畢。牧齋國子及女兒都來向牧齋和如是叩頭。牧齋的親族尚未知曉，所以祇有家中幾個人。如是的女兒不由哀哀哭泣，眾人都哭起來。牧齋悽然無語。柳如是却緊搖雙手，止住眾人的哭泣，且說道：「這雖是悲傷而實非悲傷的事。人生莫不　死，我們以身殉國，生為忠臣，死為上鬼，你們應該喜歡，何必悲泣？祇要你們以後好好兒做人，不要辱沒了父母玷汚了自己，我們雖在九原，也是瞑目的。萬一大明氣數未盡，東南數省起了勤三一之師，將來能够逐退胡虜還我河山，那麼「王師北定中原日，家祭無’忘告乃翁。」陸放翁的詩可以為我們一誦，更是你們的幸，而我們在地下也要距躍三百，曲踊三百了。你們又何必哭泣呢，徙亂人心，這是兒女子態萬萬不可有的。」柳如是說畢，眾人果然不敢哭了，於是柳如是携着牧齋的手，走向後花園去。衆人遙遙地隨在後面，不敢聲張。牧齊穿了朝衣朝冠，踱着方步，只是嗟嘆。這時正在暮春，天氣已暖，園中柳綠花紅，景色鮮妍，花架七的酴醵已是開放了，乳燕在嫩錄的柳絲中穿梭般的來來去去，黃鶯兒也在枝上嬌啼。牧齋不覺嘆道：「大好春光，傷心人對之觸目驚心，怎有閒情去玩賞？杜甫所謂國破河在，城春草木深，「虞山一片土，安能長保乾净呢？柳如是在旁說道：「我們所以不願生在齷齪世界中，一死反而乾净了。」牧齋又嘆了一口氣，繞着荔枝小徑走去，一座小軒之前有幾株李樹，堆着一座玲瓏的假山，假山之下正有一泓清泉，池水很是清澈，也有幾條遊魚在水面唼喋，四圍繞以白石之欄，以前牧齋嘗和如是在池邊飛觴醉月，鬥草吟詩的，想不到今日要畢命於此，能無感慨？牧齋走到池邊，立停了，又四下瞧瞧。（二三）</p>

<h3>失敗的成功者</h3>
<p>— 新良</p>
<p>有這樣的一個故事：四個大學生才畢業，他們決定各自去謀發展；但當他們要分離之前，他們每人拿出一百塊錢來，交給其中一人的伯父保管，投資；到了＋五年之後，誰的成就最大，誰就可得這一筆獎金。</p>
<p>結果呢，一個成功了大工程師，一個成功了政府的經濟顧問，一個在澳洲發了一筆大財，旣有錢，又有聲望；總之，這三個一般說來都成功了。</p>
<p>還有一個，本來預備是要做一個小說家的，終於為了要負起家庭的擔子，他不得不在一家規模很小的出口商行那里做一個低級職員；所以，到了十五年之後的那天，他就寫了下面這封信寄給他從前的同學們：</p>
<p>「親愛的朋友，我只有——一個妻—照我的眼光看來，她是世界上最可愛的妻子了</p>
<p>四個孩子、最好的。一個快樂的家—沒有再快樂的了。</p>
<p>一股奮鬥的精神—覺得很快活。</p>
<p>我在某方面的羅是巳經失敗了，但是在我的家庭生活中—我是成功的。</p>
<p>相信我，我仍舊喜歡尋開心，對於你們的富貴榮華，我決不怨妒。」</p>
<p>結果得到那筆獎金的？不是那位工程師，也不是那位經濟顧問，更不是那個富翁，却就是那位低級職員，那位「成功的失敗者」。那三個旣有錢又有聲望的同學，當讀到了那封愉快的信時，他們的心中都感到他們自己是失敗了！</p>
<p>眞正的「成功」該是一種溫和的，甜蜜的生活。不必一定要很多的錢，也不必一定要很大的，很神氣的頭銜；但是，一種愉快的心地，一種奮鬥的精神，却是每一個要成功的人所必不可少的！</p>

        <h1>1940.12.28</h1>
<h3>Five Million Elite Chinese Troops Determined to Launch a Major Counteroffensive Next Year; Guerrilla Force of Over One Million Sees Great Improvement in Equipment; Communication Lines of Various Battlefields Constantly Cut Off by Chinese Forces</h3>
<p>Chongqing – According to a spokesman for the Chinese military, the main task of the Chinese army next year will be to intensify all necessary preparations for the final counteroffensive against the Japanese army. This statement has attracted great attention from people here. Although the spokesman did not provide details, he stated, "1941 will be China's year of counteroffensive and victory." It is said that the Chinese army has increased to over three million regular troops, over one million mobile troops, and a large number of new troops are currently in training. Due to the development of inland automotive and arms industries, the current equipment of the Chinese army is incomparable to before. Although the Japanese forces near Guangzhou have increased slightly, it is doubtful whether they will launch any large-scale military operations in northern Guangdong. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<p>Chongqing – At a press conference today, a Chinese military spokesman, in response to inquiries, stated that China's military strength has been greatly enhanced and that a major counteroffensive will be launched next year. Therefore, it is not inappropriate to call 1941 the "Year of Counteroffensive." Last year, China had two million troops; this year, it has reached five million, of which over one million are guerrillas. The clothing and equipment of the troops have seen great improvement, coupled with the experience of years of combat, and their quality has also made significant progress. As for the situation on the front lines, there have only been minor skirmishes in the past week, with no major developments. The Chinese army continues to disrupt Japanese transportation. Rumors that the Japanese army intends to launch a major offensive in Guangdong Province are extremely unreliable. According to intelligence received by the Chinese army, the Japanese troops concentrated in Zhongshan County are being transferred elsewhere, indicating that the Japanese have no intention of launching an offensive in that area. (Havas, 27th)</p>
<p>American Attitude Increasingly Tough</p>
<p>Tokyo – This morning, the Nikkan Kogyo Shimbun reported that the American attitude towards Japan is now increasingly tough and will limit Americans in the Far East to return home by the end of January next year. Sources with inside knowledge claim that this rumor is becoming increasingly reliable. Several American ships will arrive in Yokohama in January, including the President Taft on January 3rd, the President Coolidge on January 4th, the President Pierce on January 9th, and the President Cleveland on January 18th. In the past, only one or two American ships arrived in Yokohama per month. The United States will also take economic action against Japan, ordering American ships not to pass through Japanese ports in the future. When a government spokesman was asked about the US government's repeated orders for Americans in the Far East to return home, the official declined to comment because he had not received official information. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<p>Japan Has Not Conquered China</p>
<p>Tokyo – Colonel Mabuchi of the Japanese Army Press Corps, in an article published in the Nichinichi Shimbun, warned the Japanese public not to be complacent and overly optimistic about the Sino-Japanese conflict. He stated that many Japanese seem to believe that the conclusion of the Tripartite Pact has shifted international trends in Japan's favor. However, he believes that the international situation is currently shifting in the opposite direction and is advantageous to the Chongqing government because the Tripartite Pact has led Britain and the United States to resolve to aid the Chongqing government. Therefore, unless there is a drastic change in the world situation in the future, there is no hope of the Chongqing government completely collapsing. The current China situation is extremely complex, and it cannot be thoroughly understood with just common sense. Japan is currently fighting the Chinese army led by General Chiang Kai-shek on Chinese territory. However, even if the Chinese army is defeated, it will not resolve the existing Sino-Japanese war. The majority of Chinese people gathered under General Chiang’s banner represent the essence of the Chinese people who love their country, and behind them stand countries such as Britain and the United States that are aiding the Chongqing government in resisting Japan and maintaining the old order in East Asia. The powerful efforts made by Japan against the Chongqing anti-Japanese camp should be fully recognized. Some Japanese people have the mentality that the Japanese army can defeat the enemy, and thus have the feeling that Japan has already conquered China, but this is not the case. Today, the Chinese people are divided into two major camps, one seeking peaceful means and the other seeking to fight to the end, both aiming for China's revival and independence. On this point, the Japanese should not wear glasses clouded by prejudice and arrogance when viewing China and its people. Japan advocates building a new order in East Asia and a Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, which is a good intention, but unless Japan actually implements these plans, everything is just empty talk. If Japan does not have the strength, any treaties and agreements it concludes with other countries are just a piece of waste paper. This has been proven by Germany. Now is not the time for the Japanese to seek private gain, but to strive to promote a solution to the Sino-Japanese conflict, accelerate the reorganization of armaments, and expand production capacity to establish a nation with particularly strong defenses.

<h3>Japanese Train on Tongpu Railway Strikes Chinese Landmine</h3>
<p>Luoyang – On the 21st, a Japanese troop train traveling north and south on the Tongpu Railway struck a Chinese landmine near Linfen. Two cars overturned, killing or wounding more than 80 Japanese soldiers, including several officers. (26th)</p>
<p>Somewhere in Northern Anhui – A Japanese train on the Huainan Railway traveling through the southern end of Shuangdun struck a Chinese landmine. On the afternoon of the 20th, a Japanese train traveling from Tianji’an south to Hefei struck a Chinese landmine at the southern end of Shuangdun, destroying eight vehicles and killing over a hundred Japanese soldiers. (27th)</p>
<h3>Chinese Troops Northeast of Ruicheng Capture San Shili Fort</h3>
<p>Luoyang – On the night of the 21st, Chinese troops attacked and captured San Shili Fort (northeast of Ruicheng), breaking into the Japanese positions and engaging in hand-to-hand combat. The Chinese troops eventually captured the stronghold. At dawn on the 22nd, a unit of Japanese troops from Monan Town launched a counterattack, but was defeated twice, resulting in over 300 Japanese soldiers killed or wounded. (27th)</p>
<h3>Failure to Resolve Thai-French Border Disputes Will Lead to Serious Consequences; Thailand Demands Return of Lao Territories; Conspiracy with Japan Likely Involved</h3>
<p>Hong Kong – According to sources from Bangkok, the border conflict between Thailand and Vietnam may have serious consequences and is not just a small country seeking to expand its territory or a guerrilla-style war. People here believe that Thailand's demand for the return of Lao territories is probably related to Japanese conspiracies. However, Thai nationalism under the leadership of Prime Minister Songgram is playing a key role in this war. Prime Minister Songgram is a military man who was educated at a German army school and is therefore heavily influenced by totalitarianism. He also thinks of emulating it in his hometown. Songgram was also a hero of the Second Revolution in 1933 and was the target of several assassins, but his iron-fisted policies dealt a severe blow to the conspirators. Songgram has curbed the economic expansion of overseas Chinese in Thailand and often delivers speeches promoting nationalism on the radio and in public places. Seeing Hitler's success in Europe, Songgram turned his attention to the Lao territories that France seized in 1893. At the same time, he also put forward a demand for Cambodia, but this demand is not an immediate matter. It is known that the present is a great time to launch it because France has become a weak country and is under Japanese pressure. Japan now regrets inciting the Thai people to rise up and fight Vietnam, as Japan wants to acquire Vietnam and is unwilling to hand over the Lao territories, which are rich in minerals. British pressure may be able to stop the border friction, which seems to be the only way at present, as Thailand usually exports 85% of its goods to various parts of the UK. Bangkok sources say Britain believes that if Thailand recovers the Lao territories, Thailand will have a buffer zone with Japan, so it has secretly allowed Thailand to make territorial claims to Vietnam. As for the United States, its views differ from those of Britain. The United States believes that although Thailand is only trying to recover lost territories, which is different from the actions of Japan and Germany, its opportunistic aggression violates the country's foreign policy. According to observers, Thailand is definitely not a part of the "New Order in East Asia". If Thailand can break away from Japanese conspiracies, it may become an important buffer state in future disputes and an ally of Britain and the United States. Thailand has a population of 14 million and has been implementing a conscription system for several years. Its air force is small but modern, and it possesses a squadron of destroyers and light warships. Thailand is important because of its strategic position. If Thailand is in Japanese hands, it will become the best base for attacking Singapore and Burma. (International News Agency, 27th)</p>
<p>Christmas Eve Border Warfare</p>
<p>Bangkok, yesterday's official gazette here stated that on the eve of Christmas, small-scale battles on the Thai-Vietnamese border lasted all day, with conflicts occurring in several places. French forces fired artillery and machine guns at the Thai side, and Thai forces returned fire, with shells hitting French artillery, silencing it. One Thai woman was killed and two men were injured. The French side also suffered casualties. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<p>Hanoi – Disputes between Vietnam and Thailand along the border continued on the eve of Christmas, all initiated by the Thai side, with the Vietnamese army retaliating. Thai artillery fired twenty shells at the Thai Khe District of Laos, and the French army immediately returned fire. Thai military police also fired shots at the islands of Đồng Xá Nọ and Đồng Khiêm (both transliterated) on the Mekong River, and the French army retaliated by bombarding the Thai military police barracks in the town of Khemmarat and using machine guns to strafe various military facilities there. A Thai aircraft then intruded into Lao territory over the town of Khemmarat, but did not drop bombs. In addition, French forces engaged in skirmishes with a Thai patrol on the Cambodian border in the Ya Bei Dong area. Three Thai soldiers were killed and only one French soldier was injured. (Havas, 26th)</p>
<p>Hanoi – Officials have recently issued a communiqué stating that a unit of Thai troops intruded into the Vietnamese border near the Cambodian province of Pa Lin. Our ambush troops immediately rose up to meet them, killing fifteen Thai soldiers and wounding many others. The remaining troops of that country then collapsed and retreated. (Havas, 26th)</p>
<p>Japanese Army Expands Haiphong Airport</p>
<p>Hanoi, reliable sources reported yesterday that a senior Japanese official, whose position is more important than that of General Kokuta, the head of the Japanese military mission in Vietnam, will depart for Saigon tomorrow to discuss with Kokuta Japan's desires in southern Vietnam. The official told French leaders, "Now that the Japanese incident in Tokyo Province has gradually been resolved, we are shifting our interests to the south." Recently, the Japanese acquired land in the Haiphong airfield and are currently expanding it. They are using 5,000 tons of cement to modernize the Haiphong airfield, and it is believed they have reordered 30,000 tons. Large numbers of Japanese troops have been stationed in Hanoi, and civil and military officials now own private residences. It is believed that the Japanese will soon develop the Lao Cai phosphorus mine. A Japanese official who inspected the mine said that the Japanese could obtain 500 tons of phosphorus annually from the mine. It is heard that the development of the mine will begin soon.

<h3>Chinese Troops in Anhui Capture Zhoujiagang</h3>
<p>Tunxi – Chinese troops in Anhui completely recaptured Zhoujiagang on the 21st, seizing a great deal of booty. (27th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Announce Blockade of South China Ports</h3>
<p>Guangzhou – According to reports from the Japanese South China Fleet, Vice Admiral Shimada, Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Fleet stationed in China, announced on the 23rd of this month that the Japanese fleet would begin blockading the ports of the South China coast, starting from Christmas Day. Japanese warships and naval forces have begun operations against the supply lines and ports of the Chongqing government. Japanese naval aircraft scouted and bombed various ports on the South China coast, such as Shuidong, Dianbai, Yangshan, and Guanghai, causing heavy damage to warehouses full of war materials. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<h3>Establishment of Customs Anti-Smuggling Office Postponed</h3>
<p>Chongqing – According to officials in charge of the Anti-Smuggling Office, once the office is formally established, all armed anti-smuggling teams in the country, such as the opium suppression anti-smuggling team, tax police customs, customs police team, salt police team, and the freight inspection offices in various war zones, totaling more than 30,000 people, will be under the jurisdiction of the office. They will be assigned to various important transportation arteries and key points and commanded separately by the anti-smuggling sub-offices. It is heard that because the organization is large and the regulations are complex, preparations will take some time, so the original target of establishing the office in the new year must be postponed slightly.

<p>Yesterday's newspaper reported that on Christmas Eve, no less than one million yuan was spent on dance halls and drinking, while no less than one hundred and sixty corpses were collected by the Pushan Villa from the streets. Comparing the two, who would say that the deep contradictions of Shanghai society are inappropriate. However, this million spent only sought one night of pleasure, and they do not know that the cost of continuous drinking, eating, and giving gifts is more than several million yuan! The number of street corpses is only those collected, and they do not know how many tens of thousands of people died from hunger, cold, and malnutrition. Strolling the streets and begging along the way, there is no road or place that does not see the traces of such people. And those huddled in straw sheds and broken houses, wailing next to broken mats and cold stoves, they do not know how many people there are. Shanghai is a paradise, a hell: it is one of the most joyful and laughter-filled corners of the world, or a desolate and tragic dead end, cool observers know it, do those who live in a drunken dream think about it at all? Alas? This is indeed the strange shape of urban society, and also the evil result of social disease and the inability to transform human morality.</p>
<p>This year's prices are almost unprecedented in Chinese history, and this year's life is also a rare encounter for the Chinese people. On the one hand, we only see speculators active in all directions, all with full wallets and excessive spending, while on the other hand, everyone is exhausting all their resources and still fearing it is not enough. Speaking of the vagrants on the streets, they are very bitter, eating in the wind and sleeping in the dew, only waiting for the benefaction of passers-by. The lives of the poor in tile houses should be better than theirs, but they do not know that begging is obstructed by face, and who will be a patron if they ask for loans. In the cold winter, they are still thinly clad and have little firewood or grain. Because a yuan for a liter of rice, a yuan for a catty of oil, a family of five, with a daily income of two or three yuan, can only barely survive on porridge, and there is no time to take care of clothing. When disease comes, they rely on their original resistance to deal with the disease demon, and there is no source for medical expenses. Don't they usually make plans for supporting their parents and raising their children? But their savings have been oppressed, squeezed, and sucked dry by today's speculative merchants, powerful thugs, and giants. Isn't their income slightly increased compared to before the war? However, the increase is limited, and the rise in prices is unlimited. With limited wages meeting unlimited prices, it is rare not to be overturned. This high price is what has promoted the general poverty of society.</p>
<p>People in Shanghai, don't they think of the helplessness of the poor? Only those who are richer often do not know the hardship of poverty. This is also because their circumstances make them so. Living in tall buildings, how can they know that there are still attics in straw sheds for people to live in? In the midst of sumptuous feasts, how can they know that there are those who cannot get enough to eat all day, and cannot even ask for leftovers? In the warmth of the red stove, how can they know that there are those who shiver in the cold and snowy world, only with the heat of their blood and body temperature to fight against the cold waves? Although, it is said that the people of Shanghai are not all numb, they have never been unkind. Who is not as good as I want, with this in mind, those who do good deeds, although this year's poverty is more severe than in previous years, this year's relief also surpasses last year. Just in terms of porridge tickets, there are more than ten groups currently issuing them, and benevolent groups have ordered no less than 60,000 tickets. There are two or three other places selling cheap meals. As for those who give away cotton clothing, some benevolent groups distribute them centrally, others distribute them separately, or specialize in helping the hidden poor. The Cilian Society also follows last year's example, distributing steamed buns and ginger soup; and some people give away steamed bun coupons or even rice tickets, which proves the enthusiasm for burying the winter and providing relief. However, this is still only passive relief, which cannot eliminate the hidden dangers of social unrest or save mankind from distress, so in the active aspect, it still lies in the leveling of prices and the continued holding of Yao Zhen.</p>
<p>The greatest difficulty in leveling prices lies in the gradual obstruction of freight transport. Whenever one steps into an occupied area, chickens cannot be slaughtered, eggs cannot be cooked, cloth cannot be cut, and cannot be carried, even clothes that have been made, belongings, and items like cigarettes and matches are subject to detention and confiscation. Goods from Shanghai cannot enter the occupied areas, and goods from the occupied areas are not easy to enter Shanghai. Even between the occupied areas, the various difficulties are the same. Thus, freight transport loses its convenience of circulation, supply and demand lose their effect of adjustment, the prices in various places are all expensive, and the people's livelihood in various places is all difficult. The suffering they endure is greater than that of the residents of Shanghai. However, Shanghai's people's food has already been deeply affected. Wheat is controlled and cannot come, rice is plundered and cannot come. Fortunately, the transportation of foreign rice is free. The import of foreign noodles and foreign wheat is not worried about being interrupted. Cotton is monopolized, yarn is manipulated, cloth is controlled. Clothing is important, but there is no harm in wearing old clothes that have been sewn and patched. So its severity is not as great as that of the people's food. The rice merchants in Shanghai often use the price of grain in the mainland as an excuse, but they do not think that the high price of rice in the mainland is due to the sudden increase in population, and the mainland does not produce rice, and it has added many people who eat rice, how can it not seek more than supply. Third, the import of grain to the mainland, along the coast, has been blockaded by Japanese warships, and the mainland is close to the occupied rice-producing areas, and it needs to compete with the Japanese army, and Shanghai's source of foreign rice can almost be said to be available every day. Therefore, the high price of rice in the mainland is still excusable, but those who hoard grain are still sentenced to death. The high price of grain in Shanghai is entirely due to hoarders relying on their strong financial resources to gamble and make advances, to be an enemy of the people's food. If the price of rice remains high for a long time, to the point where the general public cannot buy food as usual, then diseases will break out, and the roads will be thorny, and Shanghai will no longer be a happy land. Therefore, what is most urgently needed today is to level the prices of general necessities of life, and the only key lies in how to work together to eliminate the obstacles in front of the rich. Speculative merchants should take a step back and think, if the whole society is poor, and you are rich alone, you will also feel that wealth is not a blessing. Why not take this opportunity to plan a self-preservation strategy, and do not make excessive demands, to preserve the livelihoods of the general public? Then, although the eastern corner is lost, it is not too late for the mulberry elm to receive.</p>
<h3>British Far East Commander Arrives in Hong Kong to Inspect Defense; Use of Singapore Naval Base Issue Soon to Have Agreed Plans Between Britain and America</h3>
<p>Hong Kong – Sir Brooke Popham, the newly appointed Commander-in-Chief of the British forces in the Far East, arrived here this morning from Singapore to consult with naval, land and air force leaders and inspect defenses. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<p>Manila – The Manila Bulletin recently published a dispatch from New York Times correspondent Abende, stating that it is expected that a formal plan for the joint use of the Singapore naval base by Britain and America will soon be decided and will not be abandoned due to Japanese opposition. (Central News Agency, 27th)</p>
<p>Manila – Abende, manager of the New York Times Chinese office, told journalists here today about the situation in Singapore. He stated that he did not see warships around Singapore. In November, the British garrison troops increased their strength, with the largest number of Indian troops arriving, and Australian troops also arriving. The air force strength has been greatly enhanced. Britain has strict censorship of speech in Singapore, and all facts and figures related to military defense are kept secret. However, Japanese spies are still very active in secret. In the short term, Britain and America will establish a formal agreement, and Singapore will become a joint naval base for Britain and America. It is believed that Manila will also become a joint naval base for Britain and America to show the spirit of cooperation. The defense of Manila is not as tightly arranged as that of Singapore, and there are still several areas of defense on the east coast that are empty. However, preparations for destroying roads and railway traffic in case of emergency are well in hand. The US government is buying large quantities of tin and rubber, and the prices are low.

<h3>Burmese Journalists Tour Group to Go to Chongqing Today</h3>
<p>Chongqing – The tour group of eight Burmese journalists, originally scheduled to arrive in Chongqing by plane from Kunming today, will not be able to arrive until tomorrow due to the lack of aircraft flying to Chongqing today. The authorities will host a banquet for the group tomorrow evening, hosted by Propaganda Minister Wang Shijie and Director Dong Xian Guang. The Central Daily News carried an article this morning welcoming the group, emphasizing that the Chinese and Burmese people should trust, respect, and help each other, and that there is absolutely no conflict of interest between them. The matters that the group should pay attention to are (1) China's actual combat strength, (2) the Chinese people's adherence to the Three Principles of the People advocated by the Founding Father, (3) China's construction efforts, (4) the atrocities of the Japanese army in China, which can clarify the true purpose of the Japanese-advocated New Order in East Asia. (Reuters, 27th)</p>

<h3>American Public Opinion Unanimously Advocates for Armed Sanctions Against Japan. Yarnall Expresses the Need to Protect Legitimate Rights. Former Ambassador to Japan Still Holds Isolationist Views.</h3>
<p>New York - News yesterday: The New York Post recently conducted a public opinion poll in the United States. The results showed that 80% of the American people advocate using force to stop Japan if it launches a southern advance. The newspaper held a poll asking the question, "Should we use force to stop Japan?" The results showed that 80% of the people favored using force to stop Japan, while only 20% opposed it. After the vote, the poll also published the contrasting opinions of Admiral Yarnall, who served as commander of the US Asiatic Fleet from 1936 to 1939, and Castle, who served as ambassador to Japan during the 1930 Naval Conference, for public review. Yarnall's opinion favored using force to stop Japan. Yarnall believed that all of the United States' interests in the East were threatened by Japan's use of force to invade East Asia and advance into the South Pacific, and that our country's people and commerce were also being excluded from this vast region. Castle stated that the only American interest in the Far East was commercial interest, and that the United States seemed to have completely forgotten that its most important commerce was trade with Japan. If the United States went to war with Japan, it would not only lose this trade with Japan but also reduce future trade opportunities in any part of the Orient. Japan is the most industrialized and advanced country in the Far East and, as such, is best qualified to hold a leading position in the Far East. Yarnall also declared that the appeasement policy had failed in both Europe and Asia. Both Germany and Japan have recognized the appeasement policy as a symbol of weakness, and implementing the appeasement policy has only strengthened aggressive actions. One must be prepared to protect one's legitimate rights by force if necessary. This method of protecting rights by force will be far more effective in stopping Japan's aggression than the appeasement policy. It should be understood that the appeasement policy is a sign of weakness and has long been ineffective. If we do not protect our legitimate interests in time, we will have no rights to protect. The war in China and the war in Europe are one and the same because they are both wars in which the three dictatorial countries, based on a kind of military pact, are resisting the world's democratic countries. If we want to preserve culture, we must overthrow this absolutism and force the governments of these dictatorial countries to be led by people who understand honor and justice, and be led again by people who recognize that war and conquest only bring harm to the people. There is no shortage of such wise men among these three dictatorial countries, but today they have either been exiled or silenced. If absolutism is not overthrown, there is no hope of restoring normal international relations and reducing the military burden of various countries. Castle stated that defending the Philippines was the only reason to resist Japan's southern advance. Castle said that the Philippines is now nearing independence, and we have promised it independence in a few years. If we do not go to war with Japan, the Philippines can remain completely secure. If we go to war with Japan, it will be difficult for us to defend the Philippines. Our attempts to interfere in foreign politics have put us in danger of war. Being in a miserable situation is a new experience in American history. If we get involved in the war, we will be attacked from all sides. Our ally England has forgotten that it has placed reporters in a dangerous situation. It should be understood that if the United States fights in the Far East, it will be difficult for the United States to help England again. As a result, some Englishmen have recognized this point and are deeply worried about a war between Japan and the United States. We should keep the fleet stationed in the Pacific and not act rashly until the navy has doubled in strength. If at this time the fleet goes to the Atlantic to assist the British Navy, the result will only be that the United States is in a crisis of disappointment. Those who advocate a strong stance against Japan all say that Japan does not want to attack the United States, so there is no danger of war. These words are an extremely insecure sluice gate. How can it prevent the invasion of floods? We must know what the purpose of a war between Japan and the United States is. Can anyone explain it? Is a war between Japan and the United States beneficial to the United States and any major power in the world? This question cannot be answered with certainty. (27th day United Press dispatch)</p>
<h3>Soviet Composer's "Song of Chinese Friends"</h3>
<p>Chongqing - The China Chorus is recently working hard to popularize music. The Chongqing Municipal Government has stipulated that six theaters in the city will allocate one performance per month for the group to hold public performances free of charge. The first public performance is scheduled for January 2nd. In addition, the group received dozens of magazines from the American Writers Association and a song by composer Orshan Yin called "(Song of Chinese Friends)". The lyrics are translated as follows: (1) We bathe in the warm sun of spring and salute our friends, in distant China, in heroic China, the home of our friends. Bullets of the enemy are above their heads, and under their feet are the ruins after the bombing. They are far away on the other side of the mountains, but our hearts and songs are connected to them. (2) In distant China, in heroic China, there are strong national resistance fighters, facing the spring sunshine with full of hope. They hold guns against the enemy. Our songs fly over the forests and fields, harmonizing with the songs of Chinese friends. They are far away on the other side of the mountains, but their hearts and songs are connected to us.

<h3>National Government Issues Order to Commend Qian Changgan</h3>
<p>Chongqing - The National Government issued an order on the 27th stating that Qian Changgan, a technical expert in the Ministry of Communications, had a deep understanding of bridge engineering. After the outbreak of the War of Resistance, he was loyal and devoted himself, contributing his knowledge to the country. He successively handled important bridge projects in Gu, and was able to plan them carefully and benefit transportation, regardless of difficulties and dangers. This was no small achievement. Unfortunately, he died in a plane crash when a civilian aircraft he was on its way to Yunnan was attacked by Japanese aircraft. Remembering his virtuous labor, we deeply mourn his loss. He should be commended by order, and the Examination Yuan should be instructed to transfer the case to the Ministry of Personnel for generous compensation, in order to recognize his merits and encourage future generations.

<h3>Frequent Troop Movements Between Germany and the Soviet Union. Serious Situation in the Balkans. Twenty German Divisions Pass Through Hungary and Romania. Possible Action in the Spring.</h3>
<p>Budapest - German and Soviet troops are still moving this morning. Allied mechanized reinforcement units are deploying along the left bank of the Prut River. At the same time, tens of thousands of German troops are entering Romania from Hungary and reportedly deploying in all directions. This German troop movement indicates that Germany will take action in the Balkans via Greece, which may even affect the Soviet Union's strategic position, as well as the future of Bulgaria, Romania, Greece, and Turkey. The standard German forces in Romania have been expanding rapidly. According to various estimates, they will expand to between 200,000 and 500,000. News from the Balkans indicates at least 300,000. Red Army troops with tanks, heavy artillery, and other war equipment are stationed along the Prut River on the Soviet-Romanian border. Heavily equipped German detachments are reportedly heading to various areas along the Romanian border adjacent to Bulgaria and Romania. Bulgaria and Romania have been greatly threatened. (20th day International News Service dispatch)</p>
<p>Budapest - Yesterday, it was reported that because Germany was deploying large numbers of troops into Romania, the Soviet Union was also strengthening the Red Army garrison in Bessarabia and the eastern border areas of Poland, and expanding the artillery and aircraft squadrons in those border areas to confront the German forces. This news was transmitted here by travelers. Since Germany deployed 300,000 to 500,000 troops into Romania, it is widely believed that these rapidly expanding German forces in the Balkans will take action in the New Year, thereby affecting the Soviet Union, as well as Bulgaria, Romania, Greece, and Turkey. The news of the Soviet Union increasing troops has strengthened this belief. As standard German troops traveling by train through Hungary into Romania gradually increased to 500,000, Romania has been completely under German military control. The tension in the entire Balkan situation is intensifying, with a high risk of breakdown. There are various external rumors about the true motives and purposes of the German troop expansion in Romania. Diplomatic circles speculate that Führer Hitler will ultimately be unable to attack Thessaloniki in Greece via Bulgaria and Romania to assist Mussolini. If so, then Herr Hitler will risk a reaction from Turkey, as Turkey has warned in advance not to allow the Thrace region to be invaded. Some people also believe that the previous reports that the Soviet Union had demanded complete control of the mouths of the Danube River caused tensions in German-Soviet relations, and that the German troop movements may be related to this matter. (27th day International News Service dispatch)</p>
<p>Budapest - According to eyewitness reports yesterday, German army transportation through Hungary has been greatly intensified in the past three days. Trains carrying large quantities of military supplies are passing by every hour, indicating the needs of a large-scale German military operation. (27th day United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>New York - An American news agency's dispatch from Budapest stated that about twenty German divisions, fully equipped with mechanized units, are continuously passing through Hungary by train en route to Romania. Another report said that 1,000 German military trucks have arrived in Trieste for distribution to Italian troops. (27th day Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>London - Regarding the story from New York about German troop movements through Hungary, official circles here stated yesterday that they had no knowledge of it. (27th day Reuters dispatch) Authoritative Nazi officials in Berlin yesterday vehemently denied foreign reports of Soviet-German difficulties in Romania, saying that such reports were "a routine attempt by foreign propagandists to damage relations between the two countries." (27th day United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Sofia - Observers pointed out that Hitler's territorial ambitions for the Soviet Union's Ukraine may not have been abandoned. Germany, using Romania as a base, may launch a blitzkrieg against Ukraine as early as January, when the ground is frozen solid and suitable for mechanized operations. Hitler's tactics often involve surprising moves and cannot be limited by common sense. (27th day United Press dispatch)</p>
<h3>German Troop Increase in Romania Shocks All of Europe</h3>
<p>Istanbul - A certain source who recently returned to Turkey from Romania stated that the arrival of a large number of new German troops in Romania is of great international significance. The Romanian authorities did not anticipate that Germany would add any number to its 42,000 troops stationed there. Germany currently has at least seventy divisions stationed on the Soviet-Russian border in Poland, but if troops are transferred from Germany to southern Poland, it is possible to go through Hungary, as the railways in southern Poland are very old. (27th day United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>New York - Rumors of a large-scale German troop movement to Romania shook all of Europe yesterday. Apart from diplomatic sources saying that trains in Hungary were delayed for four to seven hours each, there was no official news in other major European cities to prove this. Berlin officially vehemently denied that German troops had entered Romania via Hungary. Belgrade officially denied that any German troops had entered Bulgaria. The chief of intelligence in Bucharest told the United Press that the German troops who recently arrived in Timisoara in east-central Hungary were only expanding the garrison there. Intelligence also said that "Germany does not seem likely to launch military operations in the Balkans, especially in Greece and Turkey." The United Press reporter was forbidden to publish the number of German troops who recently arrived in Timisoara. (27th day United Press dispatch)</p>
<h3>Germany's Intentions Are Unpredictable. A Major Offensive Must Await Next Spring.</h3>
<p>Budapest - Diplomatic circles believe that the German deployment of 300,000 troops through Hungary to Romania will take a month to complete. Germany seems to be preparing for a major offensive next spring, rather than attempting anything at present. The number of troops currently entering Romania ranges from 300,000 to 350,000, all of whom are fully equipped with the latest equipment and mechanized war equipment. Germany is also requisitioning 1,000 to 1,200 trains in Hungary for transportation. Diplomatic circles also believe that Germany's true intentions cannot be predicted at this time because the Soviet Union's attitude is extremely docile. Currently, very few German troops are invading Bulgaria because King Boris of Bulgaria has warned that if Bulgaria is used as a base for military operations, he will abdicate. German forces are currently quite capable of cutting off the connection between Greece and Turkey to the south, as Yugoslavia recently signed a non-aggression treaty with Hungary, making it almost impossible to go through Yugoslavia. In this case, Bulgaria's position is even more dangerous. The Soviet Union has at least twenty divisions in Bessarabia, all of which are mechanized and equipped. This number has doubled since the summer and autumn seasons. The Soviet Union's attitude may be to support Turkey, regardless of the war in other countries. If German troops invade Greece, the winter climate and geography will be major obstacles. If there is a large-scale offensive, it will have to wait until next spring. If they can capture Thessaloniki in Greece by then, it will be enough to save their dying partner, and the port is only a few hours away from the British oil fields in Iraq and Mosul by bomber. In addition, some people speculate that German troops will try to invade Syria from there, but this must be done with a sufficient base in the Aegean Sea. (27th day Havas dispatch)</p>

<h3>British Artillery Arranged in a Semicircle. Intensive Bombardment of Bardia. British Troops Continuously Reinforcing the Front Lines.</h3>
<p>Cairo - British troops consider the Italian stronghold of Bardia in northeastern Libya to be extremely important. Yesterday, they continued to strengthen their fresh troops and artillery in preparation for a final offensive. Front-line news said that although there had been some minor engagements between British and Italian troops, the situation had not changed much. British troops had gathered more than 250 cannons in a semicircle around the port. Although the Italian army put up a stubborn resistance, it had gradually retreated to Bardia. The area is now blowing cold winds, and neither side's troops know that Christmas has arrived. British troops are trying to break through the Italian defenses and drive them into the sea. They believe this will be a matter of days. (27th day United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>London - According to news received here today, the British are continuing to bombard Bardia with increasing intensity. British and Dominion troops are surrounding the port and preparing to attack. An account of the Indian troops' participation in the Western Australian victory has now been published. It is said that in the first day of the battle, an Indian division marched 30 miles in one day and set up positions near the Italian camps, successfully attacking in conjunction with British armored units. Indian troops also participated in other duties many times. On one occasion, they assisted in setting up an ambush, capturing three or four thousand Italian Blackshirt Division and Libyan troops. (27th day Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Rome - The Italian military headquarters communiqué described Italian activities in the Albanian region of the western desert, stating that there was heavy artillery fire around Bardia, an Italian stronghold in northeastern Libya. In a desert area, Italian troops repelled a British attack. An advance base of the British army was heavily bombed, and a British warship was hit. Enemy attacks on various fronts in Greece have been repelled, with heavy losses for the enemy and some prisoners taken. Italian aircraft also bombed enemy naval bases. An enemy aircraft attacking the Adriatic port of Valona in Albania was shot down. In addition, an Italian submarine attacked an enemy fleet in the central Mediterranean, launching a torpedo and hitting a light cruiser. Another Italian submarine in the Atlantic fired artillery and sank two giant ships, and launched torpedoes hitting one medium-sized ship. (27th day Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>Northern Battlefield Launches Offensive. Greek Troops Rush into Lin City. Important Stronghold Connecting Elbasan. Italian Troops Retreat to Valona Along the Coast.</h3>
<p>Athens - Greek troops have rushed into Lin City, an important stronghold on the road to Elbasan (the Greek army's future destination). (27th day Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Athens - Battle reports said that Greek troops in the northeastern region of Albania launched another fierce offensive last night. The Italian army, which had retreated to Valona in the coastal area, and those who were under great pressure in the Tepeleni, Himara, and Këlcyrë triangle areas, were greatly threatened. According to reliable front-line news, the Greek northward attack broke through the Italian front line north of Pogradec and advanced to an important junction at the starting point of the road to Elbasan. According to general opinion, Elbasan is the center of the Italian defense line in the north. The loss of that city will force the Italian army to retreat to Tirana. Large Greek reinforcements are now rushing to the northern area to join the battle. Along the coast, Greek troops are fiercely pursuing, while Italian troops are trying to resist and contain the Greek advance. Today's official communiqué stated that yesterday Greek troops captured several more Italian troops and a large number of military supplies. (27th day League of Nations dispatch)</p>
<p>London - Last night, the Athens communiqué declared that the Greek troops on the Albanian front, still in a heroic posture, are fighting hard in thick fog, snow, and cold weather, and have occupied several enemy outposts as a result. The number of prisoners and military supplies captured by the Greek troops is very large. The Italian army has been forced to retreat to the north and northwest of Himara, and has abandoned several important military strongholds in that area in the evening. A Greek military spokesman said today that the Italian army had abandoned several high grounds north and northwest of Himara. Greek troops are now clearing the occupied area of the Drinos River and entering further inland. Five Italian officers and sixty-five soldiers captured there belonged to five different units, which shows the chaos of the Italian army. Further north, Greek troops have conquered several villages.

<h3>Exchange of Letters Between British and American Naval Leaders</h3>
<p>London - The British and American naval leaders recently exchanged letters and gifts to express sympathy and understanding between the two countries' fleets.

<h3>Japanese Newspaper Promotes Major Propaganda, Claiming the U.S. Will Intensify Restrictions on Japan, as Evidenced by the Withdrawal of Nationals and Economic Oppression</h3>
<p>Tokyo – The "Tokyo Nichi-Nichi Shimbun" published an article today, stating that the United States is currently spreading "unease rumors," claiming that the U.S. government will soon strengthen its anti-Japanese attitude. However, the article did not specify the date or location of the dispatch. The newspaper listed the following events to observe the U.S. position: (1) The U.S. government will intensify its recommendation to evacuate American nationals from the Far East by January 31 next year. (2) The U.S. government will intensify economic pressure on Japan, prohibiting American ships from entering Japanese ports starting in February. The "Nichi-Nichi Shimbun" stated that the transmission of this rumor is highly regarded in U.S. policy towards Japan, as it coincides with the impending reopening of trade negotiations between France and Japan in Vietnam and amidst rumors that the U.S. is about to join the European war. The newspaper claims that "the current evacuation of American nationals from Japan is generally regarded as a general U.S. policy to intimidate Japan." The article also stated that the Japanese government authorities are preparing everything to cope with any situation arising from the withdrawal of American nationals from Japan. The "Nichi-Nichi Shimbun" also claimed that the number of American ships sailing to Yokohama in February is likely to increase, which may also be related to the intensification of the evacuation of American nationals. These ships are the President Taft on January 3, the President Coolidge on January 4, and the President Pierce on January 18. The newspaper added that previously, only one or two American ships sailed to Japan each month. It is also known that the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo has not commented on this.

<h3>U.S. Newspaper Criticizes Arms Exports to Japan, Urges Government to Pay Attention to Aid to China</h3>
<p>Washington – The "Washington Post" wrote an editorial yesterday, stating that part of the U.S. aid plan to China has been undermined by the continuous export of U.S. military raw materials to Japan. The editorial stated that the total value of U.S. exports to Japan in October was $26,195,000, which is $8,000,000 more than in September. The reason for this surge is mostly due to the large-scale export of raw and refined copper, metalworking machinery, gasoline, and other aircraft fuels to Japan. In the first ten months of this year, the total amount of U.S. exports to Japan was $191,413,000, while in the same period last year it was only $179,377,000. Our country's exports to China increased significantly in October, totaling $67,908,000 in the ten months of this year, while in the same period last year it was only $40,170,000. The editorial also stated, "The increase in trade with China is gratifying because this move can show that China, as an independent warring nation, has at least obtained the above assistance from our side."

<h3>Vichy Still Trying to Struggle to Avoid Being Drawn into the War; Pétain Will Personally Negotiate with Hitler to Resolve Tensions Between Germany and France</h3>
<p>Vichy – According to reliable sources here, after Marshal Pétain, head of the French government, received assurances from the military leaders of North Africa and the Near East that they are prepared to defend France against any aggression, Pétain took a firm stance last night to resist the pressure of German forces. It is claimed that Marshal Pétain has consistently opposed any cooperation plan to involve France again in the war and fight alongside the Axis powers to attack Britain. Observers say that this development is the goal of powerful figures and is supported by some senior officials in the Vichy government. The divisions within the Vichy government are increasing daily. Pro-German elements, through a strongly worded newspaper, have accused Pétain and his confidants of being "reactionaries." 田德, a representative and chief editor of the Paris 乌华尔报, criticized Pétain for not consistently opposing parliamentary government and heavily attacked Pétain's establishment of a National Advisory Council.

<p>Rumor That Marshal Pétain Will Meet with the German Leader</p>
<p>Vichy – After Admiral Darlan, the French Minister of the Navy, returned to Vichy after meeting with German authorities in Paris for two days, a personal meeting between Marshal Pétain and German leader Hitler seemed possible. It is generally known that after receiving a report from Admiral Darlan, Marshal Pétain remained firm in his attitude, disregarded German pressure, and opposed France's involvement in the war and fighting against Britain. Therefore, it is rumored that Marshal Pétain and German leader Hitler may meet soon to resolve the difficulties between France and Germany. Military leaders in North Africa and Syria assured Pétain that their troops would be prepared to defend France against any aggression. Since Marshal Pétain received this assurance, Pétain's position has obviously been strengthened. (International News Agency, 27th)</p>
<p>Vichy – After French Navy Minister Darlan arrived in Vichy, he was received by Pétain, followed by a cabinet meeting chaired by Head of State Pétain and also attended by Interior Minister Peyrouton, Defense Minister Huntziger, and Finance Minister Bouthillier.

<p>French National Assembly as an Advisory Body</p>
<p>Lyon's "Le Temps" recently commented on the direction of French politics, stating, "The future of France's national system should be based on our country's excellent inherent spirit, rather than the crystallization of a political action. Our national revolution is aimed at radically reforming our habits and systems to restore our spirit of generosity and freedom, not retaliatory behavior. It does not suppress the people's aspirations, but rather wants to guide them at any time while respecting public opinion. In the future, our country should replace the original Senate and Chamber of Deputies with a National Assembly, whose powers should be completely independent, so as to become Marshal Pétain's permanent advisory body. In the event of major incidents, the head of state can consult with it at any time or consult with individual members to make decisive decisions. (Havas, 27th)</p>

It also supervises the compilation and posting of wall newspapers by various primary schools. Currently, there are plans to establish an anti-Japanese daily newspaper. The sources of funding for education in the county include 4,800 yuan in central government subsidies for compulsory education, 28,140 yuan allocated from land tax, county tax, and various taxes, and 1,200 yuan from school farmland rent, totaling 44,940 yuan per year (an increase of 32,750 yuan over the previous year).

As for the management situation of various schools, most are diligent and able to work hard in the anti-Japanese construction efforts despite environmental pressures. Among them, the Nanming Hui Dong Central Primary School, the Dong Xushi Central Primary School, and the Yibin Elementary School have achieved even better results.

<h3>Securities: Grades 甲 and 乙 of Domestic Debt Both See New High Prices</h3>
<p>The public debt black market suddenly had an abnormal and unexpected development yesterday. Grades 甲 and 乙 both saw new high prices, but unfortunately, they quickly fell by half a yuan. The reason was that the same company bought in large quantities, intending to tighten its position, but it thought that its strength was not great, and it immediately settled out when it was profitable. It is difficult to predict whether this kind of so-called rising trend will continue. Jiu Liu, because the Northern Gang had quite a lot of absorption, had a light capital and heavy interest, and its future should still have progress. Yesterday morning, the same company bought in first place, De Fu followed, Lian He was the palace, and retail investors fueled the flames. The market price gradually rose, without looking back, and suddenly improved by one yuan and two or three jiao. Ding Kang Yitai and Sheng Da then sold at a good price. Lian He De Fu continued to buy in the afternoon, Sheng Da made up for it, and Xie Kang Zhen Chang bought in. Grades 甲 and 乙 then saw new high prices again, but Ding Kang Yitai continued to sell, the same company turned to sell, and Hong Da Shun Chang Hou Da all settled out. The high price of Grade 丙 suddenly dropped from four yuan and six jiao to four yuan at the closing. The price of Grade 甲 was raised by four jiao, and then it was returned. The foot of this rising trend is not solid, and it is afraid that it will not be easy to maintain without falling. As a result, the market price unanimously rose by three jiao to one yuan and four jiao, and the turnover was about three million yuan. A brief table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock trading: 300 shares of Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company were traded, and the price was twenty yuan, seven jiao and five fen, which rose very sharply. It is rumored that the company's profits this year can be 2 million yuan.</p>
<p>Also, the stock market of the public institute of commerce and industry opened steadily. Later, due to the covering of short positions, the prices tended to rise. Near the closing, the stocks of all stocks became more and more fierce. It is generally expected that the market will open high in the new year. The most traded stocks include Yangzi, International British Union, Jardine Matheson Yarn Factory, Jardine Matheson Brewery, and Wheelock Marden, which all closed at high prices. Rubber stocks were also affected by industrial stocks at the closing and were extraordinarily strong.</p>
<p>London, 26th (Thursday) Electric, today the listed prices of Chinese foreign debt and Far East British companies' stocks were all flat. Only the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's British registered shares fell by 3 pounds, and the price was 75 pounds. The rest did not change.</p>
<h3>Yarn Flowers: Yarn Market Rises and Retreats Wildly; There is a Difference of More Than Forty Yuan</h3>
<p>The yarn market has huge fluctuations, and the situation of rapid advances and retreats is more and more intense. This is entirely due to the different wills of the long and short sides. At first, sellers were frightened and rushed to cover their positions. Then it was heard that those who profited were selling, and then the foreign exchange turned longer and gold fell. As a result, the chips were slightly relaxed, and the shorts became active again. The floating market was painful and the new market gradually weakened. According to rumors in the market, the attitude of "foreign guests" is still silent. The new high of 20-count Double Horse was seen at 1,433 yuan, and the low price broke the 400 yuan mark, at 1,391 yuan. Today, 480 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Double Horse opened in the morning, because the popularity of the previous day was strong, and the shorts were eager to make up for it. The first plate price was 1,415 yuan. As soon as this plate was opened, buyers came one after another, and the sellers were difficult to cope with. It rose directly to 1,433 yuan. Then, those who made a profit settled, and the price slightly loosened, falling back to 1,416 yuan. However, the foreign exchange opened slightly shrinking by one gear, and the market turned up again, rising to 1,428 yuan again. In the middle, it was heard that the speculative longs were settling a lot, and the situation turned down for a while. The market revolved and went down. It was almost 12 o'clock, and the trend in the field changed greatly. It was said that rumors were flying around. Many said that foreign exchange was going to be longer, and the floating households sold and the market price went straight down to 1,394 yuan. Statistics show that 6,105 bales were traded in half a day. The market price of 20-count Double Horse fell by 15 yuan. The amount of each gang's purchase is listed as follows: same industry 6, (〇〇〇) Hong Kong 105 statistics 6, 105 In the afternoon, the yarn market began to rise and then remained flat. Twenty count Double Horse first made 1,400 yuan, then 1,392 yuan. Someone wanted to enter, and then made 1,400 yuan again. Finally, the price was 1,395 yuan.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market is Quiet as Usual</h3>
<p>The current cotton situation is similar to the previous day, but the factory's demand is not strong, and the holders still have no intention of compromising on sales, so the market is quiet as usual.</p>
<p>Another news is the foreign cotton market price. The New York cotton market is firm. First, because of the poor weather report in the cotton area, and then because of the purchase of the same industry, the closing price rose by five or six pounds compared with the previous day. India stopped trading.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, foreign cotton transactions have been quiet in recent days due to the tightening of the exchange rate. The factories have a strong intention to purchase, but the same industry is unwilling to sell at a low price. However, according to the trend of the cotton market, the cotton price is still expected to rise.</p>
<h3>Food: Rice Market is Silent; Prices See a Slight Correction</h3>
<p>Foreign rice slightly leveled off yesterday, because after the cessation of brokers' entry into the market, speculative trading suddenly became silent, and floating retail investors also sought to get out of the market with the market. Moreover, a certain firm sold more than 1,000 packages of broken rice, selling at the limited price of 76 yuan. In addition, the public warehouse's rice reserves are already in progress, and orders are also being evacuated, and people's hearts are turning flat. The spot market price has been reduced by about one yuan. However, the sales in the market are still middle and second-class goods according to the limited price. If the high-priced goods such as Saigon are limited, they still cannot get out of the sample. Therefore, the trading of spot rice for the whole day was only more than 2,000 packages, and only 200 tons of futures were opened in small transactions, with December at 95.5 yuan, January at 87.1 yuan, and January next at 88 yuan. The price was also about one yuan lower than the previous market.</p>
<p>Thick and thin are more observant, domestic rice and glutinous rice have a little more trading, but because people's hearts have been emptied and the sales market is weak, the selling price has been devalued by about one yuan. It is estimated that Kunshan 斛 of white japonica can be seen from 100 yuan to 97 yuan, and Qingjiao 斛 of thin rice can be seen from 92 yuan to 90 yuan, and the original package is 96 yuan. The glutinous rice is tired in this environment. The prices of Xuanli domestic yuan have been sold at 94-95 yuan, and the prices of Hong Kong white yuan have been sold at 84-85 yuan, also down by about one yuan compared with the previous market.</p>
<h3>Huge Amount of Canada Flour Traded; Appetite of Hoarders Gradually Slackens</h3>
<p>Flour: Yesterday's foreign flour market was first concentrated and then flat. The opening in the morning was quite firm, because the supply of Chinese flour was decreasing day by day, and foreign flour has become a necessary product for local customers. Generally, merchants insist as usual. It is heard that local customers have purchased more than 2,000 packages of Huashen brand Australian flour, at a price of 22 yuan and 95 fen, and more than 5,000 packages of Hua Wu Zhonglou brand flour, at a price of 22 yuan and 75 fen. It is rumored that grain merchants have newly ordered two ships of Canadian foreign flour, at a price of 4.5 US dollars per barrel, with loading in January and February. People's hearts in the market, after hearing about the conclusion of this huge amount of fixed flour, the appetite of hoarders is more slack, and the evening market situation is gradually loosening. As for the sale of flat flour, it will be maintained until the end of the year as usual. The new method for January next year will be decided after considering the source of foreign wheat, it is said.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday, the trend of wheat was still firm. Chinese factories have not made any significant progress for a long time, and Japanese factories are paying attention to absorbing futures. It is heard that the price of Chinese train wheat is 30 yuan to 29.5 yuan. About 10,000 packages were thrown by merchants to Sanxin Factory. The shouting price in the market is very high, still 32-33 yuan, and there is no proper transaction.</p>
<h3>Oil Cakes: Oil Market Supported by Hoarders</h3>
<p>Yesterday, due to the easing environment and the softening of people's hearts, the oil market, under the downstream trend of soybeans, was strongly supported by a part of hoarders, but the overall situation was not good, and the result was still a fall. It is estimated that 150 pieces of Chengfu Jiaozhou raw oil were sold at a price of 94 yuan to 93 yuan. 100 pieces of new goods were priced at 94 yuan and 5 jiao. 100 barrels of Dalian soybean oil were priced at 115 yuan and 75 fen. 200 barrels were delivered in the upper part of January, and the price was 116 yuan and 25 fen. 100 barrels were delivered in the lower part of January, and the price was 117 yuan and 25 fen. 300 barrels were delivered in the upper part of February, and the price was 118 yuan and 5 jiao. 150 dan of Da You Factory soybean oil were priced at 93 yuan and 5 jiao to 93 yuan.</p>
<p>Today, 2,380 packages of beans, 15,820 pieces of soybean cakes, 100 packages of sesame, 650 cans of sesame oil, 800 packages of raw kernels, and 3,400 cans of raw oil are all being shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth Prices Rose Too Rapidly, Sales Have Stagnated</h3>
<p>Factory Cloth: Yesterday, the market saw prices rise in the morning and fall back in the afternoon. Initially, market sentiment was enthusiastic, and all goods were quoted with unanimous increases, ranging from 50 cents to 75 cents per piece. However, actual sales to customers remained sluggish. Wholesale dealers on this street have already stopped extending credit due to year-end accounting procedures, and are temporarily suspending restocking except for goods awaiting sale. There were also rumors of a delay in the issuance of new miscellaneous banknotes, causing market sentiment to weaken. Small retailers rushed to sell, and selling pressure led to a price decline, ultimately resulting in prices little different from those before Christmas. Around 400 pieces of various cloths were traded on this street. Cantonese and Hong Kong dealers handled over 100 pieces of bleached and dyed cloth, coarse cloth, and twill. Zhejiang, Ningbo, and Taizhou dealers handled nearly 100 pieces of coarse cloth, bleached cloth, etc. Northbound Yantai dealers handled 70-80 packages of heavy-weight Double Elephant brand suiting fabrics.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: At the opening, due to the soaring yarn market, the upward trend was particularly strong. Twelve-pound Dragon Head fine cloth was sold for $43.20. Later, with the decline in bid prices and yarn prices, the market for mid-range fine cloth, which actually sells, showed signs of stagnation again. Outside speculators sold off their holdings, causing prices to soften gradually, closing at $42.56 at midday. The market continued to fall to close at $41.90. Four Gentlemen's broadcloth was $1.2005.</p>
<p>Exports: 1,150 pieces of cotton cloth were shipped to Hong Kong today (28th).</p>
<h3>Spring and Summer Woolens: Significant Transactions</h3>
<p>Light-colored spring thin flannels, thin plain broadcloths, various spring goods for Chinese and Western clothing, summer goods like panama, feather yarn woolens, worsteds, harvey woolens, flannels, etc., have all seen significant transactions recently. Dealers are keen to stockpile, mainly because there are more Heqi (a type of cloth) this year than last year, ample funds, small inventory levels, rising factory prices, shrinking foreign exchange limiting imports, and expectations that the Yangtze River will open, boosting the market and creating shortages, driving prices even higher.</p>
<h3>Zigong Woolens Decline</h3>
<p>Original color Zigong livery woolens, previously in short supply due to market shortages, experienced two or three price increases. Western goods were particularly popular. Recently, market sentiment has weakened and turned sluggish due to the arrival of Eastern goods and production from domestic Yin Feng and Dalu factories, leading to a balance between supply and demand. Those holding inventory no longer see room for speculation. Yesterday, Fook Tai original color Zigong woolens sold for $45 per yard, Yin Feng Cai Shen Hu for $28, and Dalu Yi Ben Wan Li for $25.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Sugar Prices Stabilize</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend turned flat, with little fluctuation. The guild's quote for current goods, two-four group white, outside the warehouse was $79.40, a slight increase of 10 cents. Dutch red current goods were $64.20 to $64.00, in the warehouse $64.90, end of the month delivery $64.50 to $64.40. Taikoo Car White B Mark west of the warehouse remained at $78.50, end of the month delivery $78.10. DY Mark west of the warehouse new goods were $77.20, HX Mark $76.80 to $77.00, showing a slight rebound. Although domestic sugar quotes increased, there were few buyers due to transportation difficulties in various regions.</p>
<h3>Reasons for Sugar Market Increase Vary</h3>
<p>Recently, the sugar market has risen rapidly, reaching new highs. On the 24th, two-four coarse white reached $81, and Dutch red reached $65.50. The guild saw more inflows than outflows, indicating a potential sugar shortage. The reasons are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Higher settlement prices: Dutch sugar is settled in US dollars, and the recent shrinking of the US dollar exchange rate has led to higher sugar prices. If the exchange rate recovers, sugar prices will likely ease. (2) Total market inventory is around 70,000 bags. Although new arrivals are continuous, outbound sales are also strong, preventing the accumulation of inventory. (3) The approaching Lunar New Year, with daily sales of around 2,000 bags, boosts market sentiment. (4) Sugar merchants adulterate sugar with cornstarch to profit. However, cornstarch prices are now over $80, exceeding sugar prices, leading many to anticipate higher sugar prices. (5) In the past, cheap Japanese sugar dumping suppressed market prices. This year, Japanese sugar imports are scarce. Recently, Japanese merchants have been buying coarse white sugar in the market, totaling over 10,000 bags, with unclear intentions. (6) Due to the sudden purchases by Japanese merchants, there are rumors of increased customs duties or the opening of the Yangtze River, but these are unreliable. However, the Japanese purchases have fueled various rumors and suspicions. (Hua Qiang Que Chou)</p>
<h3>Dried Goods: Golden Vegetables Reach New High Prices</h3>
<p>Recently, the arrival of golden vegetables has been limited, and dealers have tightened supply, causing the market to rise repeatedly with strong upward momentum. Top-grade vegetables reached a new peak yesterday, opening at $120. Other mid- and lower-grade vegetables also followed suit. Based on current demand, further tightness is expected. Medicinal Materials: Kushenzi (Sophora Root Seeds) Up $20 Due to the lack of supply and dwindling market inventory, kushenzi has seen increased demand from various groups recently, driving up prices. Compared to the beginning of the month, prices have risen by as much as $20 per load.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Factory Silk Records Recent High, Sold for $5,000</h3>
<p>The overseas silk market after Christmas remains flat. The New York market is down slightly by 1.5 points compared to the last market before the closure. Yokohama and the rest of the New York silk market remain at the original levels. Local silk prices have been affected by the recent establishment of a "New Central Bank", leading to a contraction of foreign exchange and soaring silk prices. Yesterday, Jardine Matheson and Da Chang sold 50 bales of white factory silk, 78%, 20-22 denier, at an opening price of $5,000, $400 higher than at the beginning of the month. This price is the highest record in recent months.</p>
<h3>Metals: Blue Lead and Iron Sell Actively</h3>
<p>The blue lead and iron market has been quite active recently, with thermos bottle factories and blank manufacturers absorbing significant quantities (due to seasonal factors), making the market lively. Market sentiment is boosted by the contraction of foreign exchange, and quotes are quite firm. Yesterday, goods from Hui Company opened at $140 per 200 pounds, while Lianban opened at $150 per crate, each rising by $5-6. Besides local manufacturers, out-of-town businesses are also active. Tianjin and Yangtze River merchants are also stocking up, leading to optimistic expectations for the future.</p>
<h3>Coal: Hongji Coal Dust Price Increase, Up $13 Per Ton</h3>
<p>Hongji No. 2 white coal dust, under the pretext of a sharp increase in freight costs last month, had once raised prices, and coal briquettes had followed suit, with factory prices increasing. Unexpectedly, yesterday, cargo handlers took advantage of the recent foreign exchange contraction, and raised the price of No. 2 dust by another $13, from $155 to $168 per ton. Other lower-grade dusts, such as Xinhong dust and Guba dust, also increased accordingly.</p>
<h3>Economic Miscellany</h3>
<p>— Feng Liutang</p>
<p>Cigarettes</p>
<p>Cigarettes are machine-made products, even more indicative of foreign influence. They are also called "fragrant silver" because their aroma is superior to any other tobacco. Generally speaking, opium smoking is the most cumbersome, requiring one to lie on their side, curved. It is also the most time-consuming, taking several minutes to prepare and smoke even a small amount.</p>
<p>Water pipes are less cumbersome than opium, but still require a water pipe, loading tobacco, blowing smoke, burning the tobacco, and disposing of the ashes, which is not very convenient. Dry tobacco can be said to be the most convenient, but because the pipe is small, it doesn't hold much tobacco, and the taste is not as good as cigarettes. Carrying it is also not as convenient as cigarettes, as it requires at least a foot-long tobacco pouch and other items. Therefore, cigarettes are uniquely convenient. They don't require a pipe, and one can continue to work normally with a cigarette in their mouth. They are suitable for walking, standing, sitting, and lying down, reaching even remote areas and all corners of the world. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Decides to Convene Special Meeting of Foreign Ratepayers, The Council Proposes to Increase the General Municipal Rate by 40 Percent Starting Next January</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council held a regular meeting yesterday (27th) and decided to convene a special meeting of foreign ratepayers on January 23 next year to consider adding an additional 40% surcharge on the current general municipal rate (i.e., 18% plus an additional 50% surcharge) and land tax collection rate, and separately setting the fee rates for various licenses, which will be charged at 27% of the current general municipal rate and 1.35% of the land tax. According to the new method, an additional 40% surcharge will be levied simultaneously starting from January 1 next year.</p>
<h3>Saigon Cancels Rice Export Ban, Rice Prices Fall There, Rangoon Even Cheaper, Rice Market Closely Supervised, Rice Merchants Fearful</h3>
<p>Most of the rice needed in this city comes from Saigon, and the price of rice there is based on the price of rice in this city. Now that the market prices of various foreign rice in this city have been assessed and limited, and are being strictly enforced, this news has been transmitted to Saigon and other places. Therefore, the rice merchants in Saigon believe that since the price of rice in Shanghai has been assessed, if they continue to tighten the original price or increase it further, the Shanghai rice merchants will not be able to make a profit, so they are hesitant to move forward and turn to other places to purchase. This has some impact on the business of Saigon rice merchants. General sentiment has changed from firm to soft, and market prices have begun to decline. The mainland newspaper reports that, according to business sources yesterday, Saigon has lifted the ban on the export of No. 1 Saigon rice. 80,000 bags of Saigon rice are already on their way to Shanghai. This move will have a good impact on the rice market in this city.</p>
<p>Rangoon Price 50 Yuan Per Tan</p>
<p>Yesterday, rice industry sources revealed that the current price of Rangoon rice is only about 50 yuan per tan in national currency. Although the quality of this rice is not as good as the rice produced in Siam and Saigon, the value is ultimately cheaper than the above two types of rice. If it can be shipped to Shanghai in large quantities, it will also be the only fundamental way to stabilize the people's food supply. Although there is a shortage of rice transport ships, it is reported that relevant parties are actively trying to increase the number of sailings so that large quantities can be transported to Shanghai. This is a counter-evidence to the rice lice using high costs as an excuse for rising rice prices.</p>
<p>Reform of Rice Market Requires Perseverance</p>
<p>After the market opened yesterday morning, it was rumored that more than 100,000 bags of tribute rice would arrive in port in early January, causing great anxiety among hoarders, who feared that market prices would plummet and suffer unexpected losses. Therefore, high-end rice grains have been seen in samples. Regardless of whether it is domestic or foreign rice, each tan has fallen by about 1 yuan compared to the previous market. The total number of transactions in the city reached more than 2,000 bags. According to a person familiar with the rice market, the handling of the rice market reform has been more stringent this time. Because there are no speculative elements in the market spreading rumors and purchasing rice on behalf of outsiders, the market transactions are based on actual sales as a principle. If we can further dredge the source, the market price is expected to not have much large fluctuations. However, this measure must be adhered to in order to lay the rice market on a stable path. If the rice market suddenly tends to stabilize, we should consider the interests of a few people who are excluded from the market and revoke the measures restricting entry into the market, then speculative elements will be able to re-penetrate the market, which is not a benefit for the people's food supply in this city. It is hoped that relevant parties will pay attention to this.</p>
<p>Eight Periods of Fair-Priced Grain Sales for a Total of Fifteen Days</p>
<p>Since the rice price increased, tens of thousands of poor people in this port have hoped that the eighth period of fair-priced grain sales will be realized as soon as possible. According to the Dazhong News Agency reporter's inquiry to the fair-priced grain sales committee, the 30,000 bags of broken rice ordered from the foreign production area will soon arrive in this port. The eighth period of fair-priced grain sales will be held around January 5 at the latest. It is also learned that the fair-priced grain sales date is about 15 days, because each rice firm must handle the end of the year when waste accumulates, so the fair-priced grain sales date will be shortened.</p>
<h3>Cross-Border Road Construction Donation and Tax Disputes, Negotiations Are Pending</h3>
<p>It was recently reported that a so-called "Shanghai West Municipal Government Tax Collection Office" sent letters to Chinese and foreign factories within 100 meters of both sides of the road built across the border in West Shanghai, requesting "tax collection." According to the Yangjingbang land regulations, the donations and taxes in the area within 100 meters of the road built across the border are collected by the Municipal Council. The reporter specifically inquired about this matter from the donation office of the Municipal Council yesterday. According to a senior official of the office, the donation and tax dispute in the area of the road built across the border in West Shanghai cannot be resolved for a while. Negotiations cannot begin until the police agreement of the "Joint Police Power" is signed. In recent months, a "tax collector" has been repeatedly sent by a certain party to the area to collect donations and taxes. Although he has not received a detailed report, according to what he knows, some taxpayers in the area have already paid taxes to the Municipal Council and also paid taxes to a certain party. This is their voluntary loss, and the Municipal Council cannot interfere.</p>
<h3>Salvation Army Allocates Funds to Help Foreigners, Gives Cash According to Life, Beneficiaries Total 120 People</h3>
<p>The Shanghai division of the Salvation Army, in order to help poor foreigners in this port, specially distributed a large amount of cash on Christmas Day, distributed by Major Marie Mountain, the district chief, to 120 poor foreigners, and divided them into three types according to their living conditions: couples and one child were each given 25 yuan in national currency, two children were given 30 yuan, and more than one or two people were given 40 yuan. The army has followed the usual practice of distributing a large number of Christmas packages on Christmas, but this year it has been changed to cash, and the recipients are very practical.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese in Dutch East Indies Donate to Motherland, Exceeding 10 Million Yuan, Allocated to Charitable Donations in Various Parts of the Country, Another 5 Million Yuan Donated in Quinine</h3>
<p>There are more than 1.3 million overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies. Although they are far away overseas, their patriotic enthusiasm is no less than that of others. Among them, the city of Batavia accounts for more than 1.2 million people. Since the war, overseas Chinese have been enthusiastically donating money and have never slackened. In addition to regular monthly donations, there are also occasional dedications of gold and charitable recreational activities. As of November this year, only</p>
<p>Batavia Overseas Chinese</p>
<p>Donations to the Motherland's charity donations alone are more than 13 million yuan. There are also many other individuals who remit money directly. In addition, the donation of quinine medicines back to the country is even greater, totaling 650,000 Dutch guilders, equivalent to more than 5 million yuan in national currency. This quinine is greatly needed on the front line, and will be</p>
<p>Continuously Donated</p>
<p>This time, when Wu Tiecheng went to the Dutch East Indies, the overseas Chinese were very excited. At the welcome and farewell meetings, they donated more than 6 million yuan on the spot. Local overseas Chinese are mostly from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong, and hundreds of groups can unite sincerely. Especially for work that benefits the motherland, the communication is closer and the cooperation is more effective. Especially recently, Japan</p>
<p>Advancing Southward</p>
<p>All the overseas Chinese in the area, in addition to being vigilant about themselves, are even more concerned about the motherland. They have now sent overseas Chinese leader Qiu Yuanrong back to the country to investigate the actual situation and prepare for overseas Chinese to return to the country to invest and run real industries in the future. The authorities warmly welcome Qiu's visit and provide him with various conveniences. The news is that a satisfactory result was obtained, and after returning to Batavia, he will widely promote the motherland.</p>
<h3>Wenzhou Rice Famine Turmoil, Many Killed, Disaster in Ningbo and Shaoxing Counties is also Severe, Yin County Implements Two Porridges and One Meal System</h3>
<p>According to the Datong News Agency reporter's inquiries, Wenzhou, which is located in eastern Zhejiang, has always been known for its rice production. Recently, there has also been a rice famine, and people have no way to purchase rice, so they petitioned the county government and were shot at by armed teams, killing and injuring many people. The public caused disturbances, destroying the residences of gentry such as Chen Zhuosheng on Fu Slope Temple Lane, Tang Boyin in Bailifang, and Zhang Ruzhou, the town chief in Chengnan.</p>
<p>Councilors Send Condolences to All Famine Victims</p>
<p>After receiving the news, the Zhejiang Provisional Council sent a telegram of condolences, saying, "Yongjia Chamber of Commerce transfers to Yongjia Jin County Public Appraisal, recently heard that the Yongjia people petitioned the county government because they could not purchase rice, and were shot at by armed teams, killing and injuring many people. After hearing the news, this meeting expressed deep condolences and has decided to send a telegram to the provincial government to quickly raise and transport rice for relief by emergency methods, and to strictly investigate and handle the matter. It is hoped that all the people will abide by order together to maintain the security of the rear, and a special telegram of condolence is sent for your public appraisal, Provincial Provisional Council."</p>
<p>Ningbo and Shaoxing are also Extremely Serious</p>
<p>In addition, in Ningbo and other counties, such as Yin County, the system of two porridges and one meal has been strictly implemented, and the expansion of winter planting and miscellaneous grains has been promoted. On the one hand, rice has been purchased from various rice-producing areas in Zhejiang and Jiangxi to provide relief. However, according to estimates, the county's food supply can only last until February next year. In the spring and summer, there will be a serious period of hardship for the people's food supply. A famine has already occurred in Zhenhai County, and gentry from Shanghai and Zhenhai are providing rice relief to Yin County.</p>
<p>Provincial Relief is Too Slow to Help</p>
<p>The remaining counties, such as Cixi, Fenghua, and Shaoxing, all feel the lack of food, especially Shaoxing, which has suffered from the aftermath of the war, and the food panic is extremely serious. People are starving to death on the roads, and the situation is tragic. Although the province is coordinating and adjusting the situation and sending economic delegations to various places to inspect and inquire, the relief is too slow to help.</p>
<h3>Honda went to Ningbo, and Japan increased its alert, All three bridges were locked</h3>
<p>At 8:00 a.m. yesterday, special precautions were suddenly taken in the Hongkou area and along the Suzhou Creek. All bridges along the Suzhou Creek, such as the Waibaidu Bridge, Zhapu Road Bridge, and Sichuan Road Bridge, were blocked by the Japanese army, cutting off traffic. All military vehicles and pedestrians south of the bridge could not pass. The situation was very serious. It was not opened until 8:30 a.m. It was blocked for half an hour before and after. According to foreign sources, the reason was that the new Japanese ambassador to Ningbo, Honda, went to Jiangning and passed through the area, resulting in temporary precautions.</p>
<h3>The Owner of Fang Dan Land Appeals to Restore the Electricity. The Municipal Council has No Right to Levy Land Donations and Taxes. There has been a Judgment, so there is No Need to Appeal Again.</h3>
<p>In the Fang Dan land tax case collected by the Public Concession Municipal Council, the Chinese Ratepayers Association has severely protested to the envoys of the countries concerned after receiving the report from the landowner, and attached a copy of the judgment of the First Special District Local Court that the Fang Dan land tax does not need to be paid. Yesterday, the landowners Fang Jiahe, Hu Jingfang, Fang Wende, etc., jointly notified the Chinese Taxpayers Association of the purpose of filing a lawsuit with the Consular Court and explained the errors recorded in the foreign newspapers. The original text is recorded as follows: "To the honorable ones, after reading the news in the newspapers translated from the English American Evening Post about the Shanghai Municipal Council's unauthorized collection of donations for the Fang Dan land, the taxpayers thought that there may be misunderstandings. The evening post thought that the taxpayers and the consular joint court filed a lawsuit on whether the bureau has the right to collect donations for the Fang Dan land. However, the taxpayers are now asking the court to restore the original state of stopping the supply of electricity and compensation for various damages after the power outage. The independent judicial authority has determined that the bureau has no right to collect donations for the Fang Dan land, which is obvious and there is no doubt. Therefore, the taxpayers request your association to forward it to various newspapers."</p>
<h3>3,000 American Overseas Chinese in Shanghai Decide to Delay Their Travel. They Will Observe the Development of the Situation Before Deciding Whether to Go. Only a Few American Missionaries are Travelling.</h3>
<p>According to an investigation by a Western reporter to the American overseas Chinese in this port, the evacuation of American overseas Chinese from the Far East, which was in full swing eleven weeks ago, has gradually been forgotten. There were originally 4,000 American overseas Chinese in this port, but now there are about 3,000 remaining. More than half of these 3,000 people are family members, and hundreds of them originally intended to accept the advice of the State Department and prepare to evacuate, but it is heard that they have now decided to postpone their trip. According to an observer, these American overseas Chinese seem to be observing whether the situation will worsen. According to an official of the steamship company, he firmly believes that unless there is a new development in the situation in East Asia, American overseas Chinese in this port are unlikely to continue to evacuate, but judging from the records of the American President Steamship Company, American missionaries in China are still continuing their plan to return to the country. Each President's ship has several American missionaries taking it back to the country. It is reported that in the future, it will still be difficult to find second and third class seats on the President's ship, but there will be a lot of spare first class seats.</p>

<h3>New Year's Day of the 30th Year of the Republic of China, All Circles Prepare for Commemoration, At this Very Moment There will be No Extravagant Celebrations, Citizens will Promote Thrift as Victory Approaches</h3>
<p>The New Year's Day of the 30th year of the Republic of China will arrive in an instant. That day is also the anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China. All circles in this port, at this very moment, when the country is in danger, have decided to follow the central government's order and not engage in extravagant celebrations. Various organs and groups such as the customs, post office, courts, Municipal Council, Public Concession, banks and money changers, various markets, embassies of various countries in Shanghai, and various schools, etc., will follow the usual practice of raising flags and taking three days of vacation to mark the occasion. At the same time, the citizens of all circles, as the year is renewed and national victory is approaching, in addition to the belief in resisting and building, which is more determined, will also enthusiastically promote the movements of saving to build the country, donating conscience money, and providing disaster relief, so as to strive for victory and complete the great cause of resisting and building.</p>
<h3>Coal Briquettes Price Increase</h3>
<p>The coal briquette factory has assessed the price, that is, it must not exceed 140 yuan per ton. However, some of the larger coal briquette factories have acted against the law and ignored it. Therefore, they have increased the market price of coal dust needed for the coal briquettes they hold, using the excuse that the cost of manufacturing coal briquettes has increased, so they have increased the market price of coal briquettes to 160 yuan per ton. Because of the impact of foreign exchange contraction, the market is restless. Coal merchants use the opportunity to firmly hide their existing goods and refuse to sell them easily. After the coal market opened yesterday, people became more and more panicked, and as a result, the market price of coal briquettes was raised by 8 yuan per ton. The current factory price has risen to 168 yuan, and the retail price has reached 180 yuan per ton, that is, 9 yuan per load (100 market catties). However, according to the New Voice News Agency reporter's inquiries, the coal dust currently shipped to Shanghai was all transacted at low prices, and the current foreign exchange contraction has nothing to do with the market price of coal dust. However, coal merchants are taking the opportunity to increase prices, and their intentions are truly unpredictable. Moreover, the coal dust currently manufactured by various factories is not entirely Hongji coal dust. Only a small number is available, and most of it is Heling coal dust from Taiwan. The price of this coal dust is quite cheap and the quality is inferior. It is hoped that the coal briquette association and the relevant authorities will pay attention to it and stop looking on, so as to relieve the people from their misery.</p>
<h3>The Silver Money Industry's Total Close is Approaching, Monetary Resources are Abundant, Sunday, January 26, Both Industries will Still Work as Usual</h3>
<p>The New Voice News Agency reporter inquired from the banking industry yesterday that after the financial industry in Shanghai was maintained by the two national banks, it has remained stable as always. All banks have been able to obtain considerable profits. However, the demand deposit of each bank has increased compared to before the war, and there is a lack of proper investment channels. In addition to universally reducing interest rates, each bank is also trying to transfer domestic Shanghai surplus capital. All industries have been fully prepared for the end of the year and the Lunar New Year. The head office shortage of each industry at the end of the year has now been arranged so that they can pass it peacefully. The recent decline in the Shanghai market foreign exchange lending rate has proven that the monetary resources in Shanghai are abundant.</p>
<p>Date of Spring Opening</p>
<p>January 26 is the date of the total close of each industry in the 29th year of the Republic of China. In order to facilitate the collection and distribution of each industry, the Silver and Money Industry Association has decided by joint meeting that although this day is a Sunday holiday, the decision is still to operate as usual and has notified the members to follow the instructions. The money shops of the Money Industry Association members will take four days off from the 27th to the 30th, called the general settlement period, and will open on January 31. The banks of the Banking Association members will take one to two days off from the 27th to the 29th, called the Spring Festival, and will open on January 30. Regarding the handling of business matters before and after the total close, such as market lending rates and receipt collection times, the silver and money industries will hold further consultations.</p>
<p>Annual Settlement of the Lineage</p>
<p>December 31 is the end of the Gregorian year. Each bank has separately settled the interest for the commercial and savings departments, and it is scheduled to extend office hours internally on that day to rush to settle the accounts. Although January 1 to 3 are New Year's holidays, each bank will still operate as usual internally. The money industry's settlement is based on the end of the Lunar New Year, and only ordinary settlements are handled at the end of the Gregorian year. As for each factory, company, firm, etc., those who use the new accounting method will use the end of the Gregorian year for settlement, but in fact, nine out of ten are based on the end of the Lunar New Year for settlement.</p>
<h3>Auction of Goods Held Up in Vietnam; Various Industries Protest; Registration of Goods Underway; Government to Be Contacted for Compensation</h3>
<p>Since the interruption of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway in June of this year, a considerable amount of goods from Shanghai and Hong Kong merchants have been held up in Vietnam, unable to be transported to the mainland. The total value is estimated to be over ten million yuan. Later, due to Vietnamese authorities yielding to demands and preventing the transfer of the held-up goods to the mainland, and with recent reports that the Governor-General of Vietnam, Decoux, intends to order a public auction of the stored goods, leaders from various commercial sectors in the city have been jointly deliberating on countermeasures to seek relief. They have also telegraphed the government to lodge a serious protest with the Vietnamese authorities. According to a report yesterday from a reporter of the Ping Ming News Agency after visiting the local pharmaceutical industry, the amount of medicines held up in Vietnam is also not insignificant. The industry held a joint meeting of directors, supervisors, and advisors the day before yesterday (the 26th) to discuss the issue of negotiations regarding the goods held up in Vietnam. It was decided to first send letters to the relevant pharmaceutical companies, requesting them to provide detailed reports to the association on the names, quantities, and values of the goods held up in Vietnam. They will then separately request relevant government departments to argue for their rights based on reason. Other manufacturers and traders are also currently processing registration procedures. If the held-up goods are indeed auctioned off, they have decided to telegraph the government to negotiate with the Vietnamese authorities, demanding compensation for the losses at the original price.</p>
<h3>Fire Department Report from the Shanghai Municipal Council</h3>
<p>Last month, the Shanghai Municipal Council Fire Brigade received a total of 709 fire alarms, including five malicious false alarms and two special alarms. The estimated property losses due to fires within the International Settlement and the Special Rate Area amounted to 361,120 yuan. Three citizens died and five were injured in fires. Two people were injured due to special incidents. Five firefighters were injured while fighting fires. In addition, the Fire Brigade's ambulance was dispatched 524 times last month, transporting 529 patients to various hospitals.</p>
<h3>American and Italian Soldiers Brawl; Ended Amicably; Both Sides Claim It Was Just a Drunken Quarrel; Dance Hall Suffered Losses of About 7,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 27th), authorities from both the American and Italian sides in Shanghai stated that the brawl at the Da Lu Dance Hall on Christmas Day has now concluded. They claimed that the incident was purely a drunken quarrel and should not be given too much importance. Yesterday morning, officers of the U.S. 4th Marine Regiment denied that anyone died during the brawl. It was also claimed that the reports of an official apology from the Italian authorities were inaccurate.</p>
<p>Dance Hall Considers It a Minor Incident</p>
<p>However, rumors circulated yesterday morning that one Italian corporal died or was seriously injured during the brawl. Verification or denial of this claim could not be obtained from the Italian authorities. Furthermore, a letter from Mr. Hiller, the assistant manager of the Da Lu Dance Hall, stated that the incident on Christmas Eve was merely a minor disturbance. He also stated that reports of a dancer being thrown onto a brass drum and an Italian sailor being mistreated by having his head hit against a piano were untrue.</p>
<p>Italian Troops May Compensate for Losses</p>
<p>The Da Lu Dance Hall is currently seeking compensation for the damage to furniture during the brawl, totaling two thousand yuan, and for unpaid bills of five thousand yuan from customers who scattered. According to an officer of the U.S. 4th Marine Regiment, the U.S. authorities will not be responsible for the compensation. It is believed that the Italian authorities have expressed regret over the incident and will bear the compensation.</p>
<p>The Situation at the Time Was Very Tense</p>
<p>It was reported that when the American and Italian soldiers began to brawl, there were about 1,500 customers in the dance hall. Upon seeing the situation, they scattered in panic, causing great chaos. It was difficult to exit the hall. While the melee was in full swing, moviegoers who had just left the Grand Cathay Theatre heard loud noises coming from the Da Lu Dance Hall, indicating the intensity of the fighting. It is reported that at least twenty-five soldiers were injured. The American authorities stated that all injured American soldiers had been released from the infirmary, but the extent of the Italian soldiers' injuries was unknown.</p>
<h3>Steamed Buns and Ginger Soup; Scheduled Distribution</h3>
<p>Address Being Searched For</p>
<p>The Shanghai Charity Federation, recently noting the unprecedented high prices of rice and flour this year and the difficulty for ordinary people to make a living, has decided to distribute steamed buns and ginger soup as usual. They plan to start the distribution on December 19th, which is the first day of the twelfth lunar month. They are currently actively working on the preparations. As for the distribution locations, the venues at Longmen Road and Dahua Road were selected last winter. However, due to the increase in the number of people receiving relief this year, they plan to find a wider area to accommodate everyone.</p>
<p>Shelter for the Cold</p>
<p>Since the Cilian Relief Society opened the shelter for the cold ahead of schedule the day before yesterday, it accommodated over two hundred people on the first day. Yesterday, they continued to send trucks to various roadsides to collect people and transport them to the shelter. As of 11:00 AM yesterday, over one hundred more people had been taken in. According to the society's estimate, the capacity of 1,600 people will be reached within a few days. If the capacity is exceeded, they may open a second shelter to accommodate more people and benefit the poor.</p>
<p>Distributing Cotton Clothing</p>
<p>The poor people taken in the day before yesterday were mostly emaciated and in a miserable state. After giving them baths and haircuts, the shelter provided each of them with a set of cotton clothing. Those suffering from sores and skin diseases were transferred to the refugee hospital for treatment. There were also those addicted to opium and heroin, who were treated by a contracted addiction specialist at the shelter. However, as these people's bad habits are deeply ingrained, as in previous years, some may try to escape. Therefore, this year's management is particularly strict to help them see the light and avoid sinking into darkness.</p>
<p>Children's Provisions More Than Doubled</p>
<p>The Ciyou Nursing Home, Infant Shelter, and Children's Shelter established by the China Ciyou Association are currently housing over 650 refugee children. The association is soliciting candy and used toys from all sectors for the Spring Festival. Furthermore, due to rising prices, the association had previously budgeted six yuan and fifty cents per child per month for provisions, but this has now more than doubled. Therefore, it urgently hopes that people from all walks of life will contribute to this good cause.</p>
<p>Various Industries Generously Agreed to Continue Donations</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association began providing refugee relief, various sectors have generously contributed, either by donating a percentage of salaries or a percentage of business income, providing regular assistance. Tens of thousands of victims have been spared from hunger and cold. The association recently learned that although it has repeatedly tried to disperse the refugees through various means, there are still more than 16,000 people in the shelters, mostly the elderly, weak, disabled, and homeless. At a time of high prices, it feels deeply that it is difficult to maintain them. It is specifically appealing to various industries to continue their donations for another year to complete the effort. It is reported that after the association issued the appeal, various industries such as restaurants, pawnshops, rice shops, cotton cloth shops, yarn factories, fresh fish shops, hardware shops, steel and scrap iron shops, and medicinal material shops have all agreed to continue their donations for another year according to the original plan, in order to fulfill the initial intention of providing disaster relief. Furthermore, the association's citizen fundraising committee has also taken the initiative to extend the donation period, working together to maintain the good cause. The personnel of the two disaster relief agencies are also determined to handle the matter with integrity, ensuring that every drop of contribution goes to public use and that no funds are wasted, so as to reassure all sectors.</p>
<h3>Stringent Searches After Killing of Japanese Police Officer; No Rice Allowed In or Out of Tushanwan</h3>
<p>Since the re-implementation of the "Pass System" for entering and exiting Nanshi last month, the "double pass check" has gradually loosened. However, after the Japanese police officer Minoru Sakazaki was attacked with a hatchet at the intersection of Wenmiao Road and Zhonghua Road on the 22nd of this month, the situation has become tense again. Japanese military police and patrolmen at each entry and exit point are conducting extremely strict "pass" checks, causing many residents to be unable to enter or exit and gathering at the iron gate. Among the dozens of cases of Japanese police officers being killed in Shanghai, this is the first one to occur in Nanshi. Although the Japanese side searched the households in the area around the incident, there were no martial law measures. Furthermore, after the reopening of Xujiahui Tushanwan in western Shanghai the day before yesterday, the situation has gradually eased, and pedestrians and vehicles are now allowed to pass. However, rice is subject to strict inspections, causing farmers from Caohejing, Qibao, and other places who transport rice into the concession to be in a quandary.</p>
<h3>Family Medicine Cabinet</h3>
<p>For the sake of protecting the health of the entire family, having a family medicine cabinet in the home is very important. And how to put together a family medicine cabinet can be said to be something every head of the household must strive to have. Below are some good methods for a family medicine cabinet.</p>
<p>In your house, measure a place to prepare for placing the family medicine cabinet. Just tell your needs to a carpenter, and you can ask him to make a clever wooden cabinet. After the cabinet is made, you can paint it with your favorite color.</p>
<p>The following items are essential for a family medicine cabinet:</p>
<p>(1) Magnesia: This is a laxative. It is best to take it every morning when you get up. Use one teaspoon when using it, and put it in half a cup of warm water.</p>
<p>(2) Castor Oil: This is a relatively strong laxative. You can keep one bottle on hand and take six to twelve teaspoons when necessary.</p>
<p>(3) Epsom Salts: This is a relatively strong laxative. There are already pre-packaged products on the market. Take about four teaspoons when taking it.</p>
<p>(4) Agar-Agar: This is a medicine specifically for those who suffer from long-term constipation. It is not absorbed by the intestines. The dosage is one to two tablespoons.</p>
<p>(5) Boric Acid: It has many uses. When you have an earache, you can drop a few drops in warm water and wash your ears.</p>
<p>(6) Zinc Oxide Ointment: It has miraculous effects on inflamed tissues, burns, sunburns, etc.</p>

<h3>Public Concession Police Cracked Down on Roulettte Gambling Den; Located at 1477 Jing'an Temple Road; Portuguese National Running the Operation; Suspects Arrested and Detained.</h3>
<p>The Public Concession Police, aware of the recent trend of Chinese nationals colluding with foreigners to open gambling dens within the Concession, ordered the Western Detectives Maya of the Central Police Station, Chinese Detective Feng Qishan, Chinese Detective Xu Dezhong of the Chengdu Road Police Station, and others to form a gambling squad within the General Inspection Office to handle these matters exclusively. The squad had previously discovered a large-scale gambling den on the upper floor of the Silver Capital Dance Palace at the intersection of Weihaiwei Road and Foch Road and went to arrest them, but the gambling den had already escaped after getting wind of the raid. Now, Detective Feng and others have discovered that a large-scale roulette gambling den is being run by a Portuguese national, Brata Tu, on the second floor of 1477 Jing'an Temple Road, using telephone number 37427 as its advertising sign. The den has extremely strict security measures, and only regular customers can enter. Those who gamble there are all members of the upper class.</p>
<p>Substantial Winnings and Losses</p>
<p>After obtaining a search warrant from the Portuguese Consulate, they rushed to raid the place at nine o'clock the night before last. They arrested the aforementioned Brata and nine Chinese nationals from Shanghai: Wang Jinyuan, Bian Zhun, Zhu Shoushen, Zhou Xuefang, Wang Wendan from Ningbo, Zhu Zhensheng from Suzhou, Gong Jinlang from Chongming, Gu Shuiru from Zhejiang, and seized a large number of gambling paraphernalia, including a roulette wheel, a level, two mobile gambling tables, two painted tablecloths, more than thirty mobile chairs, more than three hundred gambling ledgers, countless red and blue pencils, more than seventy chips, and a set of opium smoking paraphernalia for gamblers to use. All were taken to the police station.

The gambling den was led by Western Detective Xun Kaiden. The officers and detectives stormed into the premises and made arrests. At the time, the gambling den personnel were in high spirits, preparing to open for business. As a result, nineteen people were arrested, including the den owner, Wu Ziliang, a Cantonese national, who was caught while attempting to escape. The roulette and other gambling paraphernalia set up in the den, along with the suspects, were taken to the police station for investigation.</p>

<p>According to the Zi Lin News, the work of demolishing Chinese homes in Wangjia Lane, Da Xi Road, by the Japanese authorities is still in progress. Apart from the recent stabbing of a Japanese military officer in the area, the Japanese side has not disclosed the reason for the demolition. It is reported that the Japanese side is forcibly demolishing homes without providing any compensation. One theory is that the purpose of the demolition is to build a new road. The victims are hundreds of poor people who have lost their homes and are displaced. Residents are still moving out of Wangjia Lane, and "rental notices" have appeared in the area, posted by landlords from Nanshi to attract tenants.

<h3>History</h3>
<p>— Pinpin</p>
<p>I often wonder why humans write history? When Emperor Frederick the Great asked someone to read history to him, he said, "Call the liars." History is a lie, why write it? The great historian Gibbon also said: "History is nothing more than a record of human crimes, stupidity, and misfortune." History is a criminal file, why publish it?</p>
<p>Is history really a pile of worthless dregs? I say no.</p>
<p>Do you know how history is created? History is formed by the collision of two opposing forces. One force represents truth, justice, and morality; while the other represents evil and deceit. These two forces are in constant conflict and struggle, and mankind progresses forward. Human progress is difficult because history is a product of blood.</p>
<p>Thus, history is not for us to watch, but for us to do. Only cowards are happy to watch history, of course, the result is that he feels uncomfortable, because he sees the mistakes of the past. Brave people are to do, to create history. William Mott said well: "History represents the most pleasant place for poetry and novels, the solemnity of epic, the moving plot of drama, the horror and lessons of legend." Creating history is valuable because it is progress. Watching history makes people depressed and old; but creating history makes people excited and young. Friends, when you open history, do not read it as a dead book, but as a trumpet, calling you. Rise up your arms, fight the evil forces, you must go and create!"</p>
<p>The Greek warriors created the fruits of victory, which was inspired by the historical sites of Marathon.</p>

<h3>I Wasted Ten Years</h3>
<p>— Li Min</p>
<p>Friend, I want to tell you, in this situation, I wasted + years.</p>
<p>Ten years is a long time!</p>
<p>But what can I do? Every day I watch the sky dawn to darkness, darkness to light, just circling the circle of life, and gradually, I also become old.</p>
<p>You know, I was fourteen when I started in this business, but now I am twenty-three years old, twenty-three should be the age to get a wife, but where do I start?</p>
<p>Hearing the whistle of the steamship in the morning, I need to go to work, and dragging my corpse-like body home at night, I just fall into bed. In fact, it is not that simple, I don't know how many things need my strength, I don't know how many things need my brain, and in addition to using both brain and strength, I also have to endure the factory director's "scolding".</p>
<p>The factory director is a timid and suspicious person, but after he has eaten his wine every meal, he will say very pungent and unreasonable words. We are unwilling to meet him, but we are often forced by life to plead with him.</p>
<p>Once, I went to the factory director to borrow money for my younger brother's carbuncle surgery; the factory director was drunk from eating rice wine. I explained the reason for borrowing money, but he got angry. He said:</p>
<p>"Who cares about your family!"</p>
<p>But I can't let my brother suffer from carbuncle and even die. After the father died, should these older brothers not bear the responsibility? However, I finally endured the anger and begged several times, and finally the factory director blamed me for spending too much usually, and fiercely signed a word to lend me twenty + yuan.</p>
<p>In fact, is twenty yuan enough for the hospital? That is hard to say.</p>
<p>The staff in the factory seem to live in a "peaceful world", when they are free they do not talk about women, but talk about "mahjong" scriptures, sometimes they sigh and say that the cost of living is too high, but they do not worry about the factory, but blame their own bad fate.</p>
<p>Is fate really bad, I don't understand.</p>
<p>But I think that fate is ultimately empty, wasting like this for ten years, is there no way to change it?</p>
<p>So, sometimes I hate my father, why didn't he let me read more books, otherwise it would be better than wasting in a dark factory.</p>
<p>However, this is also superfluous, before the society is reformed, the man-eating system will always remain.</p>
<p>But in today's cost of living, I really can't get by, ten years, although I wasted it, but at the beginning of the eleventh year, I can't waste it like this anymore.</p>
<p>You probably don't know how many dollars I make a month. Friend, I only have ten dollars a month, plus the so-called cost of living allowance now, it's only twenty dollars. Where do you say I should use these twenty dollars a month? The factory director scolds me for being too wasteful, this is really unfair, rice costs one hundred yuan per picul, briquettes cost eight yuan per picul, I have a mother and younger brother at home, we have to eat. We also have to live in a house, but what do I use twenty dollars for? Buying two pecks of rice, twenty dollars is gone, what about the rest?</p>
<p>I am confused, I doubt; the factory has raised the price of goods, why is our salary not increased?</p>
<p>I painfully wasted ten years, now I can't waste it anymore!</p>
<h3>Zhangtai Willow</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Qian Muzhai slowly stood up and said, "What you say is not without reason, I will go and sacrifice myself for the country with you." Liu Rushi then walked down the stairs with Qian Muzhai. Muzhai's adopted son and daughter and all the family members were serving on the side, all with tears in their eyes. Qian Muzhai and Liu Rushi each felt extremely sad. First, they personally lit incense at the incense table, worshiped the late emperor, and then worshiped their ancestors. Muzhai's adopted son and daughter came to kowtow to Muzhai and Rushi. Muzhai's relatives did not yet know, so there were only a few people in the family. Rushi's daughter could not help crying sadly, and everyone cried. Muzhai was sad and speechless. Liu Rushi shook her hands tightly, stopped everyone's crying, and said, "This is a sad but not really sad thing. Everyone must die in life, we sacrifice ourselves for the country, live as loyal ministers, and die as superior ghosts, you should be happy, why be sad? As long as you be good people in the future, do not disgrace your parents or stain yourselves, even if we are in the underworld, we will be able to rest in peace. If the fate of the Great Ming has not yet ended, and the southeastern provinces raise an army of loyalists, and in the future they can drive out the barbarians and restore our rivers and mountains, then "When the royal army pacifies the Central Plains, do not forget to tell your father at the family sacrifice." Lu Fangweng's poem can be recited for us, which is even your good fortune, and we in the underground will also jump three hundred times, and dance three hundred times. Why do you cry, disturbing people's hearts, this is a childish attitude that must never be had." After Liu Rushi finished speaking, everyone really did not dare to cry, so Liu Rushi took Muzhai's hand and walked to the back garden. Everyone followed far behind, not daring to make a sound. Muzhai wore his court clothes and crown, pacing slowly, only sighing. It was late spring at this time, the weather was already warm, the garden was full of green willows and red flowers, the scenery was bright and beautiful, the roses on the flower stand had already bloomed, the swallows shuttled back and forth in the tender green willow branches, and the orioles were also chirping娇ly on the branches. Muzhai could not help but sigh: "Such a good spring scenery, the heartbroken people are shocked to see it, how can they have the leisure to appreciate it? Du Fu said that the country is broken and the rivers are still there, and the grass and trees are deep in the spring city. "Yushan is a piece of soil, how can it be kept clean for a long time?" Liu Rushi said beside him, "The reason why we are unwilling to live in a filthy world is that death is cleaner instead." Muzhai sighed again, and walked around the lychee path, in front of a small pavilion there were several plum trees, piled with a delicate rockery, under the rockery there was a clear spring, the pool water was very clear, and there were also several swimming fish 唼喋 on the surface, surrounded by a white stone railing, before Muzhai and Rushi often flew glasses and drunk in the moon, and fought grass and chanted poems by the pool, unexpectedly today they will die here, can they not feel emotional? Muzhai walked to the pool, stopped, and looked around. (23)</p>

<h3>The Successful Failure</h3>
<p>— Xinliang</p>
<p>There is such a story: four college students just graduated, they decided to seek development separately; but before they were to separate, they each took out one hundred yuan and handed it to the uncle of one of them for safekeeping and investment; after + five years, whoever has the greatest achievement, whoever can get this bonus.</p>
<p>As a result, one became a successful engineer, one became a successful economic advisor to the government, one made a fortune in Australia, with both money and prestige; in short, these three generally succeeded.</p>
<p>There was another one, who was originally prepared to be a novelist, but finally in order to bear the burden of the family, he had to work as a low-level clerk in a small export company; so, on that day fifteen years later, he wrote the following letter to his former classmates:</p>
<p>"Dear friends, I only have - a wife - in my eyes, she is the most lovely wife in the world.</p>
<p>Four children, the best. A happy home - no happier than this.</p>
<p>A spirit of struggle - feel very happy.</p>
<p>I have failed in some respects, but in my family life - I am successful.</p>
<p>Believe me, I still like to have fun, and I will never envy your wealth and glory."</p>
<p>Who got that bonus in the end? It was not the engineer, nor the economic advisor, nor the rich man, but the low-level clerk, the "successful failure". When those three classmates who had both money and prestige read that happy letter, they all felt in their hearts that they had failed!</p>
<p>True "success" should be a gentle, sweet life. It does not necessarily require a lot of money, nor does it necessarily require a big, impressive title; but a happy state of mind, a spirit of struggle, is indispensable for everyone who wants to succeed!</p>

<h3>Good Waiter</h3>
<p>— Hu Bei</p>
<p>In Rome, there was a foreign journalist who lived in a hotel and discovered that the waiter was a spy. He had always thought that spies were not of much importance. But this spy, Daoci, followed him all day long, and he hated listening to his important conversations very much: so he had to report this matter to the hotel manager.</p>
<p>The manager said: "What can I do? I can fire him, but the spy who is hired again may not be such a good waiter."</p>

<h3>Active Photographers on the Front Lines</h3>
<p>— Xing</p>
<p>Yellow River Line · Yunnan-Guizhou · Nanning · and Southeast</p>
<p>The contributions of the photographers in the cultural work camp cannot be erased. In the rear, they risked working under bombardment; on the front lines, they endured hardships and hardships like soldiers. They are worthy of being the cultural new army. The following is the latest situation of their access to the front lines.</p>
<p>Expanding the current situation on the Northwest battlefield, the mighty Yellow River basin, supported by the Taihang and Zhongtiao mountain ranges, has formed the most solid fortress. The photographers Tong Zhen and Ye Jiong, who are stationed in the Northwest, plan to use the Yellow River Line as the warp and the bears on both sides of the Yellow River as the weft. To make a systematic documentary film, the first thing to show is that the Zhengzhou stronghold of the Pinghan Road is connected to Tongguan. Our army's defenses have always maintained an advantage. The second is the salt production life of the people in the Huangpan area. Due to the difficulty of importing sea salt, they spontaneously improved the ancient salt lakes in the eastern Henan area. There, the salt content mixed in the soil layer, after being washed by the Huangfan torrent, and then exposed on the ground under sunlight evaporation, is the best natural salt pond.</p>
<p>The second group is Cheng Zelin, who went to the border between Yunnan, Guizhou and Vietnam alone. He set off two months ago. The Iron Army General Zhang Fakui is the commander defending the area. Cheng Zelin works with General Zhang. On the frontier, photographers need to endure hardships like soldiers. The inconvenience of transportation and walking for several days is commonplace, but this also makes the harvest in the camera more abundant, including the defenses of our army crossing the border, the life records of the local Vietnamese people, and the harmonious emotions of the Han and Vietnamese people.</p>
<p>Lian Ju, a photographer stationed in Guilin, took advantage of his proximity to the water and went to Nanning after its recovery. By the middle of this month, we can see what Nanning is like after the robbery? What is Nanning, which is being rebuilt?</p>
<p>There is also a group of Zong Weigeng who is active on the eastern battlefield. When he recovered Zhenhai and conquered 　 and, he was already working in that area. When he passed Shangrao lightly on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Road, he met with the commander and requested to collect economic construction materials from the southeastern theater. General Gu said: "The southeast is actively developing military warfare and economic warfare, and economic warfare has made more significant achievements."</p>
<p>In short, today's photographers have become the most active and sharp cultural new army.</p>
<h3>Development of Domestic Films in Hong Kong</h3>
<p>— Haixing</p>
<p>The Hong Kong Lee Theatre is the largest theater in the city. In the past, it has staged Cantonese opera and Peking opera. Mei Lanfang, Jin Suqin, Wang Xichun, Xue Juexian, and Ma Shizeng have all performed in the theater. The theater has recently been completely renovated with more than 200,000 Hong Kong dollars. It was initially planned to stage Peking opera again. Hong Kong newspapers have repeatedly reported that the first phase is Li Wanchun, the second phase is Zhang Eyun, and the third phase is Qilin Tong. The owner of the theater, Yuan Yaohong, arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday. Someone introduced him to Zhang Shankun, the owner of Guolian. After talking, Yuan believed that domestic films had great potential, and he immediately decided to abandon the original plan and sign a film contract with Guolian. It is reported that the theater is scheduled to open on the 20th of this month. The first film is Chen Yunshang's "Xiaoxiang Autumn Rain", plus a short film of nine major stars singing. The blockbuster "Xi Shi" will be presented on New Year's Day next year.</p>
<h3>Remotely Listening to Jin Shaoshan's "Lianhuan Tao"</h3>
<p>— Yu Chu</p>
<p>I accidentally turned on the radio and happened to receive the rebroadcast of "Lianhuan Tao" from Beijing Radio. I have heard the play from the radio twice. One was broadcast by the local Xin Xin Stage, sung by Li Wanchun and Sui Shengrong. Now it is a collaboration between Jin Shaoshan and Zhou Ruian.</p>
<p>It was once rumored that Shaoshan's voice was hoarse, but after listening to it today, his voice has recovered, high-pitched and loud, just like in the past. Congratulations to him. Among today's Jing roles, only Shaoshan and Wang Quankui are good at singing. (Ma Shixiao, who is now affiliated with Huang Jin and came to Shanghai with the Fu Liancheng class, has a full and flavorful voice. If he works hard and strives for further study, his achievements may not be inferior to Jin Wang.)</p>
<p>The biggest drawback of listening to Peking opera is that you can't see the charm of the stage at that time. If the two Lianhuan Tao plays, Erdun's appearance, tearing his beard, using his eyes, and the running of the horse when stealing the horse, and the expression when worshiping the mountain, the workmanship, etc., can only be understood in the brain. Shaoshan's Xipi Yuanban section sung in "Sitting in the Village" is clear and measured, and not everyone can reach it. After that, the "Stealing the Horse" "Chang" returning to the mountain, there were not many cheers from the audience. Hou Xirui is the best in this "Chang" in terms of his figure and style. Shi Haisheng and Rong Yijun are also not weak. The Yaoban of "Returning to the Village", "The royal horse is coming happily, the golden saddle, jade bridle, yellow silk rein... "Shaoshan sang the four sentences, which were as decisive and satisfying as chopping nails. After singing this section and entering the "Chang", the gong and drum sounds on the "Chang" have changed, knowing that Ruian's Huang Tianba is on the stage. Ruian was very popular in Ping in the early years of the Republic of China, and he would pick a big sign to perform (at that time, Cheng Yanqiu was still singing the opening opera in his class). Later, he also invited Jin Shaoshan to accompany him in the play. I didn't expect that he has now been reduced to Shaoshan's vassal. On that day, Ruian's Tianba made his appearance, with sparse applause, and the audience did not like it very much. Zhu Guangzu was played by Wang Fushan, the son of Chang Lin, and his speech was still clear. The "Public Hall Discussion" set a plan to "light the dart" and other "Changs". There are many transitions in it, and there is nothing wonderful to say. It was not until Shaoshan's "Chang" was changed again, and Dou Erdun came out again, when the leader reported that the dart master was asking to see him, Shaoshan shouted "Line up to welcome him", using his nasal voice greatly in the two "welcome" characters, and won a full house of applause. Immediately after worshiping the mountain and going on stage, Ruian's big paragraph of speech has a small building style. "Biao passed Malanguan..." A paragraph, sung with a full palace and full tone. It is not easy for Ruian, who is over fifty years old, to have this tone. However, Dao said that the high places are too sharp, such as the "this" character of "originally for this", which feels sharp and harsh. This may be because he is trying his best to imitate Xiaolou but his inner breath is not enough. Shaoshan's last sentence of the Liushui "Dantan" is raised, which is quite good. The two "Changs" cover each other, which is very tight. Since Tianba asked "How is Peng Peng an official?" Starting from one sentence chasing another, the two answered fluently, which is seamless. Listening and sighing are over. Finally, Baobao Village Chief said "Team sends Tianba", all the performers of this role use Beijing dialect to say it, which is purely a gimmick and has no meaning. Now Shaoshan also speaks Beijing dialect in this sentence. I don't know who started it. Wei Changtian sang "Duo Meng Village Master Kuan Hongliang" in a section of Liushui. Bao Erdun sang "Father is a hero and son is a good man" four sentences, and the whole play ended without taking the second "stealing hook".</p>
<h3>Garbo is in Love Again</h3>
<p>— Baolin</p>
<p>I saw in the previous issue that Miss Shawi wrote that Garbo's fifth love interest was Dr. Gailo Hesser, but who knew that their love river had twists and turns again?</p>
<p>Recently, a rumor has been spreading in Hollywood that Garbo is in love with the great musician Stokowski again. Mr. Shi was Garbo's fourth object, and he had been separated from Garbo for a long time; but recently after he returned from traveling in South America, he made the first call to Garbo to invite her to meet and talk. People will be confused, because aren't Garbo and Dr. Gailo Hesser very close?</p>
