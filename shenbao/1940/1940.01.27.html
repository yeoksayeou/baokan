<h3>通商航海條約失效　美日天係達嚴重階段　美國堅決維持遠東門戶開放原則倘日同志不覺悟隨時有施制裁可能</h3>
<p>華盛頓　日美通商航海條的業已廢止、目前絕無簽訂過渡協定之徵象、國會方面現已決定將此案交國務院辦理、據美國務院稱、日美商約係於今日午夜廢止、（上海時間星期六下午一時）而日方則認爲該約業於東京時間星期五午夜廢止、（即今晨十時）紐約民中黨代表白萊姆稱、「除非不再有意外事件發生、美國決不考慮簽訂新約」、又民主黨參議員格萊恩在太平洋長途電話中語日記者云、「簽訂新約之談判勢將停頓、蓋美國民衆對日方侵害在華美僑利益、極爲憤怒也」、（二十六日合衆社電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　美日商約失效事、頃由此間外交界人士加以評論、路謂日本方面迭次設法、欲與美國至少簽訂臨時恊定、卒歸無效、一俟此約於本日午夜滿期之後、美日兩國關係即當進入新階段、蓋兩國入於無條的狀况之後、雖不能謂爲現狀遽爾變更、特此後美國實處於優越地位、隨時可以有效的壓力加諸日本、查美國政府自近數月來、對日本態度至為堅決、一般人認此為美國决心拒不承認「東亞新秩序」之表現、但究之實際、自一九三一年滿洲事變以還、美國態度始終如一、質言之、即（一）維持門戶開放原則、（二）對於日本征略或兼併舉動、不論出以何種形式、一概拒不承認、（三）在遠東方面維持美國權利之完整、迄至此際、國務院首腦人物猶以爲日本輿論對於美國見解、未有正確的認識、遂致政治仍爲軍人所把持、所望輿論及時憬覺、促使日本政府改變方針、則美國仍願出以妥協態度、至若日本政府執迷不悟、趨向自殺之途、則美國政府即當考慮各種措置、其性質等於報復手段、而其形式不外下列二種、（一）禁止軍火與若干種物品運往日本、關於此層、參院外交委員會主席畢德曼業已擬就法律案、即當提付參院討論、（二）對於日本進口貨徵收附加稅、其稅率或可提高至百分之四十五、緣自歐洲戰事爆發以還、德國出口已被封鎖、不列顚帝國一切生產均須留供自用、日本倚恃美國接濟之情形日益加甚、而以作戰所必需之各種原料品爲尤然、加之日本財政狀况極不安定、僅持蠶絲銷售美國、即以所得之款維持其貨幣、以故美國倘在商務上壓迫日本、收效必宏、特以目前而論、美國政府不擬變更現狀、國會他日討論畢德曼禁運案時、國務院亦不擬加以壓力、寗願聽任國會與國內輿論自由表示見解云、（二十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　美日兩國商約業已失效、查該約係於一九一一年間在華盛頓簽訂實施以來、已歷二十九年之久、依照該約、除雙方均享有最惠國待遇而外、簽字國一方之公民並得前往對方國境以內游歷·旅行·居住·以便通商、但在實際上言之、美國自一九〇七年頒佈移民法以還、日本移民入境之事即不啻完全禁絕、惟就商務關係而論、簽約國受最惠國條款之束縛、關於進出口之任何限制辦法、苟非普遍適用於其他各國者、即不得以之加諸對方、美國過去所由未能禁止軍火與其他貨物運往日本者、其故即在於此、赫爾國務卿爰於去歲七月廿六日決定依照該約所載簽字國一方倘欲宣吿廢止、應在六個月前提出通吿一項條款、照會日本政府宣吿廢約、此項期限已於昨日午夜屆滿、因此自今日起、美國政府即可任便對於日本實施禁運辦法、或其所認爲有益之商務限制辦法矣、（廿六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>美國實事求是迫日改變政策</p>
<p>華盛頓　此間一般人士對於美日商約期滿廢止事、現正予以鎭定之觀察、一般態度以為如欲改變美日貿易關係不處於星期六日晨開始之暫時基礎、則必須東京有以發動之、美當局實事求是之印象、今可以「摜盛頓郵報」之批評證實之、該報言及美日商約今日期滿事、謂一月二十六日將爲美日關係史中簇新而重要的一頁之起點、日本對於美國在華之權益、屢次侵犯毫不加以顧忌、如是者已八年餘矣、國務院曾屢提抗議反對種種凌辱美國之不友好行爲、但此種抗議從未發生效果、今依照民衆普遍要求、停止對日供給軍用品之機會已屆、商業而受立法之干涉、則日本將受如何嚴重之損害、知之最切者莫日人若、美國將否採報復計劃以對付日本、唯視日本在遠東之行爲耳云、同時「晚星報」亦發表同樣坦直之言論、謂日政府早知必須有何種作爲、始可恢復美國對日締結商約之心理、換言之、即日本必須束縛自己以改變其在華之行爲、而由美國以其行而不以其言加以判斷是、一月二十六日爲美日關係中之轉捩點、然有絕無可疑者、必日本政策在心理上與精神上有基本之改變、而後始能發生有益的結果也云、（廿六日路透電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　美國報章在一九一一年日美商約終止之前夕聲稱、日本在遠東之行爲、將決定美國之商業是否採取報復辦法、「紐約日報」聲稱、「吾人將保持經濟壓力之威脅、以對付東京政府、直至中日戰事問題能獲滿意解決時爲止、日本不能一方以武力改造遠東、一方仍保留對美國良好關係而聽其胡作胡爲、美國至少須與東京斷絕局部商業關係」、「紐約太陽日報」聲稱、「國務院對日態度、將來是否改善或趨惡化、現尙難言、美國明達人士均同意政府對此所取之堅決立塲、倘統治日本之日本陸軍、以爲國務院乃虛張聲勢、或不計代價、（自吾人通吿廢止一九一一年日美商約意旨）則所有錯誤、山彼等負之、（廿六日合衆社電）</p>
<p>渝報切盼美國作進一步行動</p>
<p>重慶　今晨此間各報皆載社論、論美日商約今日廢止之關係重大「中央日報」謂禁阻材料運日、實為遏止日本對華侵略之最有效的方法、此舉必獲美國多數民衆之同情、掃蕩報希望　政府依守其所以廢約之政策、而勿爲日本表面安慰計劃所動、「時事新報」謂美政府自今日始、已採取有效計劃遏止日本在遠東之擴張勢力矣、（二十六日路透電）</p>
<p>日本經濟命脈操於美國掌握</p>
<p>華盛頓　商務部長　甫金今日於美日商約終止之日、發表關於美日貿易之長文、讀者對之、予以多大之重視、該文明白揭示日本對美之依賴、視美國為推銷日貨之市塲、及為供給必要的軍用品之泉源、尤以歐洲發生戰事擾亂日本在歐貿易後為甚、換言之、該文表示如有任何發展、致日本對美平常貿易發生障碍、則日本將覺如何棘手之情形、該文追叙最近數年來日本在美國貿易中、買賣皆位列第三、日本在美國輸入中佔百分之七、在美國輸出中佔百分之八、而日本之總輸入、其中百分之三四取給於美國、日本之總輸出、其中百分之十六至二〇售與美國、查日本在日幣集團中之輸出、（即不能吸收外幣之貿易）約佔其總額百分之四〇至五〇、故日本對美之輸出、乃日本國以購置原料所需的外幣之重要源泉、美國所供給日本者爲其重工業重要必需品約百分之五六、原棉百分之四〇、五金百分之四〇、機器百分之五〇、與石油百分之六五云、（廿六日路透電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　共和黨議員漢密頓今日稱、美日商約今已滿期、此在美國之植棉者、實爲一大打擊、蓋美國之植棉者、目前之地位已極可悲也、又謂美國之棉旣若是其過剩、則應不再計較國別與市價而設法脫手、始爲辦法、（二十六日合衆電）</p>
<p>兩國金融關係料將發生劇變</p>
<p>華盛頓　據此間之金融專家今日稱、自今日起、不獨美日間之商業關係已進入「過一天算一天」之狀態、同時其金融關係、亦已進入「過一天算一天」之狀態、假若今後美國所購日貨、為量仍鉅、則兩國金融之基本關係、不致有所變更、唯一切皆在未定之天、蓋日本獲取美國外匯之主要商品爲生絲、假若美國少購日本生絲、則美日金融關係即將發生劇變也、（二十六日合衆電）</p>
<p>東京　日本報紙對日美商約廢止、一致著評痛駡美國、並要求日方對美態度强硬化「國民新聞」云、「美國未能與日方簽訂新約、係極不友誼之行爲、以後如有糾粉、日方決不負責」云云、（二十六日合衆社電）</p>

<h3>美國對日將如何行動</h3>
<p>美日商約至一九四〇年一月廿六夜十二時正，信如六閱月前所預期，結束其二十九載以來之使命，喪失其拘束締約國之效能。祗因大地之空間遙隔，以致東西之時間相歧，故在上海之廿六日下午十時後，日本方面既視商約爲業被廢棄，然至上海之廿七日上午十一時止，美國方面猶必視此約爲尙屬存在。記者於茲執筆時，實介乎此存彼廢之間；若中國文字論事紀時而必嚴別其過去現在或方來，則將不知如何措辭爲允當。所幸日本雖渴望維持原約或代以臨時協定，而美國態度之强毅鮮明，則經八年歷六月至近日而彌甚；用知今日上午十一時之前，無虞何種突變，蓋美日兩國之自此入於無條約狀態，確爲既定之局勢，是堪　立論之前提矣。</p>
<p>民治國家之政策舉措，必以與情爲依歸；然自一般情緒，經由報紙雜誌演說廣播種種之鼓吹，以迄議會之決定，當局之布行，其間有空間時間之必然紆迴，亦有可能之頓挫。故據華府電訊，謂美國今後對付日本，將不外二途：（一）禁止軍火與若干種物品，運往日本；（二）對於進口之日本貨，徵收附加稅；然究竟取何一途？是否不外二途？何時首途？皆是疑問；况是否採行何種行動，亦可作根本之疑問。誠以紆迥頓挫所在，非至當局布行，未宜率爾論斷。抑輿情之所流露，美國行動之嚴重性，更得不以上述二途爲限。溯自一九三一年九一八之後，美國政策雖能始終維持其一貫之精神與論據，然各方見解則參差不齊，懸殊之甚，於是形成八九年來因循矛盾之局。卒因中國抗戰之持久，予一般美國人以從容認識遠東問題之時間，累積其遭受輕蔑侮辱侵凌之敎訓；於是制裁强暴之情緒，寖見其瓜熟蒂落，水到渠成，侵略者至近頃而遂有惡貫滿盈之觀矣，綜合美國近頃與情，消極方面無復以戒懼日本之報復，避免美日之衝突爲言，而主張美國不問遠東者。積極方面，確認日本在經濟方面依恃美國，故美國得在經濟上作有效之制裁；確認日本在遠東之野心與行動，已予美國以莫大之威脅，故美國須及時應付，母貽噬臍之悔；確認日本標榜之遠東新秩序，實爲排擠他國退出遠東之策略，故美國須待日本軍隊退出中國；確認美日之間，不僅政治外交經濟諸方面之種種懸案，爲國交之魔障，故期待日本變更其在遠東之政策與思想。輿情若此，今茲之廢棄商約其後果也。</p>
<p>美國於美日商約失效後之行動如何，茲雖未宜率爾論斷；然有可斷言者，美國當局當不以商約失效而美國取得對日行動之自由爲滿足。蓋日本若不獲商約爲保障而仍得充分享受商約存在時之同樣待遇，則廢約爲絕無意味，抑何必多此一舉；此其一。商約存在，日本得在美國購求殺人凶器，美國當局雖爲各方所詰責，又且必不免於良心之責備，徒以商約之拘束，不得不容忍此類「合法之不道德行爲；」商約既廢，美國必知自法律與道德兩方面力自糾正；此其二。自一九三七年七七以迄今茲，端賴抗戰，支撑大局，否則中國固已不國，即美國及其他各國在遠東之利益亦必早已覆亡；美國既與中國利害一致，自應予抗戰以有效之援助，予侵略以有效之打擊；美國廢棄美日商約後，當知無所行動必不能收廢約之效；此其三。國際大難，美國詎得强他國遠東政策之必與美國並行，亦猶他國之不能强美國與之並行而捐棄遠東利益；事有先後，勢有順逆，美國必知惟有率先見義勇爲，然後他國不復怯懼，不復委屈妥協，而惟美國之馬首是瞻，一體追隨；此其四。黷武者民窮兵疲，誠屬事實，然史對中國悉索敝賦，試作孤注一擲，或對他國倒行逆施，以冀同歸於盡，此在瘋在心理狀態之下，各有其可能；則挾萬鈞之力，制事機先，事非美國不辦，抑且美國所義不容辭；此其五。緣此五端，我人雖未能推測美國固將如何行動，然其必有所作爲，是可刮目而待者也。</p>

<p>香港　東京電、今日美日商約失效、英文日本時報評稱、商約存在之時、在美日商居商務代表之地位、受條約規定及移民法案之保護、可以在美國居留與其正常商業同終始、直至調派他處為止、但目前彼等之地位、已大異於昨、彼等　爲通常之旅客居留之時日限於六個月、雖科按半年爲期、再請求居留、但其總時間不得超過兩年、再無約情形之下、任何旅客均不能確定彼等是否可居留六個月以上、由於上述之情形、觀察家無不以日本所將採取之行動爲問、若干人士主張採取報復手段、此點實極爲可能、日本國民中之有切身關係者、雖已處境艱難、但勢必　將要求報復、同時政府之措置亦必須遵　民意、誠如美大使去年十月演說中所云、日僑即已　失其條約之地位、　能要求美政府予以六月居留權、美僑再日本者自亦將處于同等地位、外僑在日居留、去年六月已經政府要求彼等登記、並以一年爲期限、在到期之後、美國及其他各僑民除非政府重予准許、均須離境、同時「滿」境及其他日軍占領區、勢將實行同樣辦法云云、朝日新聞系報紙評稱日美兩政府雖均已採取辦法、消除商務上障礙、即使商約失效、　照常實行、但希望美國能重新考慮態度、並表示其調整日美關係之善意、籍以確保太平洋和平及其本國在東亞之利益、云云、日日新聞系報紙認為美國並無誠意、阻止無約狀態之發生、其動機似在拖延中國問題解決之時日、推展之歐戰結束以後、再再聯合英法壓迫日本、同時美國企圖以其經濟資源全部力量、阻止日本大陸政策之順利進行云云、「國民新問」則警告美國、無約狀態有使兩國邦交決裂之危險、督促全國以堅定決心、應付局勢云云（二十六日電）</p>
<h3>駐津日軍司令　對美恫嚇</h3>
<p>天津　駐天津日軍司令本問中將、今日向合眾社記者單獨談話時、競向美國警告、調日本決不改變在華政策、倘美國對日實施禁止軍火原料輸日、則　　日　勝　　考慮對　態度、本間　、華北日軍並不懼美增加太平洋海軍實力、爲對日「友好狀態」但　並不相信日美間有發生戰事之可能、本間又於　　一九一一年日美商約滿期時聲稱「倘美國不顧日方對美善意而不作答覆、則日本陸軍當局必需檢討此後局勢、並爲應　當之步　、乃將美國載華北之商業置於如對英法二國商業同樣限制之下、但彼　調、日美商約之滿期、並不一定作對美國商業加緊限制之解釋、唯稱、倘美國實施禁運、作為美國對日最後決定、則余覺日本量無對待美國人民須較他國人民爲優之理由」、本間於是痛斥美國對日本侵略中國之態度、渠稱、「余覺美國人民準備視日本陸軍在華任何行動、皆合惡意、或者此乃美國人民對日之故意誤會」、但本間希望兩國關係能改善、日美兩國無交戰之可能、故本間久謂、余顧詢問美國人民、日美兩國異見不能以談判方式解決者、其理由安在、余不相信日美戰事發生之可能、合眾社記者乃向本間詢問、日美危機是否最後由雙方以妥協方式、或由一方屈膝而告解決、本間答覆、日本決不改變目前政策、美國雖然誤會日本建設「東亞新秩序」之政策、世上無事能勸誘日本放棄或改變即定政策、日本爲建設「東亞新秩序」、已犧牲七萬生命、故不能考慮改變政策、東亞新秩序對美日兩國皆屬重要、故美國須與日本合作、日本並不懼與蘇聯通商爲得意之事、但倘美國到日實際禁運、則日本將被迫與蘇聯通商籍以　致重要軍需、天津日軍當局目前未會到美實施商業限制、倘美國人民感覺彼等受有限制、則彼等須承認在華「大規模敵對行為」之存在、彼等於是可以明嘹該項限制之無法避免、數項限制之所在不免、本間又曰、日本陸軍需要之皮革、因外滙缺乏不能向美購買、故不得不在中國獲致之、本間於許連美國對日本侵略中國態度時宣稱、渠最近會接由美國寄來不具名姓名之函件、要求日本軍官撤退紐約、該函調日本在紐約設立「陸軍司令部」該函勸告日本撤退陸軍　軍官、並將彼等殺死、該函指斥日本軍官任間諜、故本間指此爲美國不明嘹日本之例、蓋日本軍官在紐約者、乃爲日軍購買軍需品也云、（二十六日合眾社電）</p>
<h3>英美關係　非可離間　日蘇結合　顯難實現</h3>
<p>華盛頓　此間政界人士對於美日兩國商約失效事、極爲重視、咸調美國之廢止該約、實乃日本入侵中國之結果、日本對美雖已出以某種讓步、例如應允開放長江下游、企圖籍此與美國開始談判新商約、但在實踐上言之、該國對於新商約問題、並未有何作為、此在美國目前對於日本雖無在商務上採取歧視辦法之意、但政界人士認為自今以後、美國政府即可隨時出以此種行動、而不復在法理上受有何種束縛、其某方面鑒於美國態度堅決、　乃乘機發出宣言、調英國所推行之政策與美國完全不同、英日兩國之間業已成立一種秘密協定、此其用意顯在離開英美兩國、但當局業已切實予以否認、自亦無人更予置信、自另一方面言之、美日兩國商務關係今後即使不能圓滿解決、日本亦未必即與蘇聯作進一步之結合（二十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>太平洋遠東方面　劃分新經濟勢力範圍　以相當利益讓予日本　美雅納爾將軍之主張</h3>
<p>紐約　前美國亞洲艦隊司令雅納爾語記者云、今日廢止之日美商約、係美國在遠東方面事件解決之開始、雅納爾續云、彼對禁止貨物運往日本一節、完全贊同、但各國應在太平洋給予日方一種出路、俾分化日方在中國的力量、又雅納爾大將已草就太平洋經濟劃分新地圖、該地圖規定由英法荷美在太平洋方面將相當利益讓於日本、雅大將認為茍各國准許日本在印度·安南·荷屬東印·及菲列賓獲得同等貿易機會、則日本國內自由派人士必可阻止軍人之侵略云、（二十六日合眾社電）</p>
<h3>崑崙開展蹟踏訪記　山頂勁風掃蕩不了日屍的臭味　日軍死守八塘阻華軍向推進　崑崙開的險要有時爲證</h3>
<p>踏著　聲走完碎亂的石　、就走上從右首來的公路、汽車已在附近守候、登車後、一路顛簸下坡、可以直達南　、知道杜軍長要上×××高地的觀測所視察、因隨同攀登××山、時已經落幕、就沿著觀測所的×條電話線直上、這裏也是日人頑抗的所在、山頂晚風雖勁、還是掃蕩不了中華土地中異國屍體的臭味、日本軍閥對於士兵的性命、原是視同草芥、但對於屍灰卻一向看得特別鄭重、崑崙關之役、連這一點也　不到了、我們可以想象到當時日軍的狼狽情形之一斑了、</p>
<p>夜色較濃、山下機槍聲也愈激烈、華方在崑崙關附近砲兵、不時以××溜彈砲向八　方面猛射、山鳴谷應、聲勢赫赫、我們走進觀測所、</p>
<p>參謀從掩蔽部出來、在星光下、還依稀看得出他那高大的身材和久經風霜的面容、他微笑地說、「日軍砲兵很軟弱、彈藥也似乎有限、當它向我陣地射擊時、一經我方射擊、久立即沉默、不敢回擊、華軍砲兵壓倒日方砲兵、崑崙關之役、可說是第一次、」</p>
<p>在九時西南方向的小高地的背後、有兩處火光、×參謀說、「那是今日中午午日機投了五十多枚炸藥的效果、引起這兩處荒山上的草和樹在燒著」、他說起日機在前線的活動云、「有一天、日機在我陣地投了一百多個炸彈、只有兩個兄弟受傷、飛機威脅不了我們、我們也不一定要飛機掩護、這次攻擊崑崙關、我們的砲兵在日機盤旋下依然對日陣作效力射擊、而且砲位始終沒有被日人發現、」</p>
<p>我們的砲兵繼續在發射、炮彈劃過夜空、　在長嘯、也像在狂笑、××門炮火的集中、使八塘上方泛起淡淡的紅　、逐漸加農、逐漸擴大、砲兵觀測手報告、「八塘起火、我軍離八塘鎮一公里」、</p>
<p>杜軍長在觀測所和攻擊八塘的部隊長官通話、知道兩翼進展很速、他指著遠處不斷上沖的信號槍的火星說、「那是我們先頭部隊發射的、我們已完全控制八塘、但日人決然死守八塘、因為八塘是崑崙關南　的　口、死守住這個　口、就可以阻止正面我軍的推進」、</p>
<p>夜深了、杜軍長囑我先下山、在黑暗中摸索到了電話線、循原途回到公路、我帶著這天的口令、通過了第二線的警戒哨、汽車繞過崑崙關、看到舊日的日軍工事已經有弟兄們在休息、有些二三十個二十個圍著營火取暖談笑、有些還在飜讀剛才桂林新聞界前線慰問團所致　的書報和賀年卡、他們顯得非常之渴想知道世界上得許多事情、</p>
<p>在××附近、強烈得事情從對面射來、馬遠和無限軌道得交嚮、使我領會到華東得戰車在繼續向前推進、偽裝使它們更龐大了、駕駛兵面前得鐵門開著、射擊手則靠在炮塔上和在路邊得步兵揮著手互換著視掩得歡呼、「打勝仗、」「消滅敵人、」得聲浪、像潮樣地此起彼伏、在山谷中迴蕩衝擊、這是一種無上得快樂、同時也是一種無上得力量、我們就用這種力量去打擊侵略者、當我回到指揮所時、這鐵的隊伍、似乎還在這處怒吼著、盼望能在最近、踏著它們的軌跡再度崑崙關、到南　去、到　防去到被佔領的一切土地上去、（完）</p>

<p>匯兌暫停</p>
<p>電報照常</p>
<p>新聲社記者昨向郵政局運輸股探悉、對於浙東各縣及浙　鐵路沿線之郵包、因該地自戰事爆發後、軍運繁忙、所有寄往以上各地之包裹、業已於昨晨起暫行停寄、其通告云、自本月二十六日起、所有寄往　縣及其經轉（包括永嘉在內）之大宗包裹、暫停　收寄、又昨接麗水管理局二十三所發遲到電報、自即日起、所有寄往紹與·諸　·楓橋·牌頭·蕭山·安昌·馬鞍·東開·臨浦·關家　·柯橋·義橋·下方橋·孫瑞·等十四處匯兌、暫停收寄、至於輕便郵件、仍照常投遞、大北大東太平洋三水線電公司消息、由瀘至紹與蕭山之水線電報、軍照常收線、由香港轉發、但是否能達目的地、不能預料、</p>
<h3>英輪在福州外　遭日艦攔阻　扣留十一小時　檢查並不簽字</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報云、怡和洋行永生號輪、航行中國沿海、今（二十六）晨抵瀘、載來旅客數人、該輪於本星期三日、會在福州外被日海軍阻留十一小時、因英輪不發無線電報告、而英海軍當局亦不發表船隻行動、故此前未問永生號</p>
<p>被阻消息　此事經過如次永生輪星期三日在福州外前駛時、有日本驅逐艦一并駛近、開放、開放空炮兩嚮、永生當即停止、以待日海軍檢定該輪身份、移時、即有日水兵一隊登輪、其軍官問永生輪船長已間英海軍攔阻間丸等間話、並向</p>
<p>旅客盤問　事畢後並不在證明該輪自受檢查之文件上簽字、而無端將永生輪扣留十一小時後、始行權放、此事與數月前日海軍在香港外四　處攔阻英輪朗浦拉號之情況相類似、日本即未對華宣戰、乃無攔阻第三國船隻交戰國權利、但</p>
<p>中日戰爭　爆發以還、日方攔登第三國船隻事、已　有所聞、英當局爲避免不幸事件起見、故令英商船對於日艦信號應予答覆、並報告船名、據英國駐日大使克萊琪爵士昨（二十五日）向日本新聞記者所稱、自一九三七年中日戰事開始以來、英商輪船日海軍攔阻者、不下一九一次</p>

<h3>一九三九年　上海工業之回顧（一）　—工部局年報之三—</h3>
<p>上年前六個月間，本市工業界繼前年而邁向復興之途。在滬西及界外馬路區域以內，較大與中等範圍之工廠，於前年動工興建；面於上年開工者，為數不少。此外有若干新興弔業，為相界內向所末見，於上年初開始籌備，重風具初步計劃。</p>
<p>上年六月間，區價緊縮，七月間，再度低落，影響所及，實非淺鮮，已設計之事來因此放棄者有之，新屋將告茗成之工廠，被逼暫緩閒工者有之。多種工業原料，價格猛漲；一則因外匯之　落，一則因有人以所存資金，紛紛購備貨品，投機操縱，以致當時曾造成一種原料比製造品較可牟利之局面。。在門壯需要未復常態門市售價未經調整以前，各廠出品，均見減縮。</p>
<p>迨歐戰爆發，原料之來源，益感困難，若干投機家逆料各種原料有益形匱乏之虞，於是再度活躍於市場，致使廠　商之因正當業務而欲採購者，反感棘手。於是十二月間，海峽殖民地政府採取戰事措施。宣布多種貨物禁止或限制入境，又予本市工業界一嚴種打擊。</p>
<p>本市工業界一因戰事關系，二因貨物運入未淪陷區之困難，及遭限制情形，三因其他各地採取營業統制政策，四因人民缺少購買力，以致喪失往常在長江流域以內之市場。於是各華洋廠商，紛紛改向國外企圖發展，結果在印度，南非洲等處，獲有新市場，不幸歐戰發動以後，各國先後宣布限制政策，以致已獲得之新市場，有若干處業經阻塞，復以航運之不定，使一般廠商，益陷於困境。</p>
<p>（各業槪況）紗廠　上年滬西及界外馬路區域內之紗廠事業大為發展，新廠之開工者，為數頗多，截至年底為止，開設於以上兩區之大紗廠，計有四十六家。其中除三家外，其餘工作均未見鬆弛，惟若干小紗廠因受外匯緊縮影響，減少工作。</p>
<p>化學品廠　製造工業化學品廠，有堪以注意之新發展，製造監酸與硫酸鈉之新廠兩家，正在建築中。其中一家，即將開工。另有兩家，已在籌德中。有製造酒精之新廠兩家，凖備開工，其中一家擬用榖類件為原料，有製造鉛丹之新廠四家（其中一家，兼製醋酸鉛及硫酸鋅。）均已開工。</p>

<p>西貢米竟出四十元</p>
<p>西貢一號自前日竟抬至四十元一市石後、昨日行商囤積居奇、愈爲起勁、各方欲買、高喊價格、一操一縱、市面步步高升、加以蘆洋尖亦破限暴漲、甚至與高粳限價同盤、洋尖猶似「虎傳翼」、囤戶貪如「狼呑羊」、至午市愈鬧愈兇、西貢一號初開四十元、收盤竟達四十元零七角、四十元零五角、二號西貢亦須四十元至三十九元七八角、火絞米早喊三十九元、後即步升開三十九元五六角、東京　尖大市貨售三十七元次至三十六元半、米　三十六元、米粞三十一二元、較前市悉騰七八角至一元之　、統計全　成交有萬六七千包、</p>
<p>洋米定價依然平定</p>
<p>洋米定價站住米動、然一號西　金高檔米、尙難合劃、好在路現貨尙多、並不爲難、二號米昨續由行家向建源等成交一千二百　、價照前盤四十八元七角、加五分、爲四十八元七角半、又小絞米則新成交三千五百噸、價四十七元半、碎米未妥、回籠貨亦以扳俏未開、緣邇日洋米又引起囤戶之活動、貨方亦復居奇扳俏、不肯出脫、</p>
<p>大宗洋米源源到滬</p>
<p>洋米不斷到滬、米價依、然不减、影響平民生計非淺、蓋有大力者操縱之故、昨日又有怡和洋行永生輪、自香港運來二千二百九十三包、起卸於羅斯福棧房、另有一萬四千一百六十三包、原船運往天津、又聞意輪蘇門搭臘Sumatra（譯音）號、定明日（二十八日）到滬、該輪自西貢運來洋米二萬餘包、進口後、預定停靠虹口華順碼頭起卸、（祖）</p>
<p>麵粉加盤在進行中</p>
<p>昨日粉市趨勢、依然緊張、各粉售價昂貴異常、本街廠盤、雖站十元原價、非但供給數量寥寥無多、此十元之粉價與四十元之米價、同爲欺騙大衆之掛牌、因麵粉現銷不足、前昨曾有多起紛擾、昨日有源隆昌等向廠家要求加盤儘售、廠家雖中心懷、但恐大宗開出、利源外溢、故仍以成本過昂、加盤有限、仍須鉅虧爲飾辭、尙不允批、但據廠消息、刻正雙方商議中，或須至下週酌加、而店方亦將劃一售盤云、客盤久已不開、除一部客戶急於需要者略辦回籠貨外、絕鮮大額成交、故市面頗見沉靜、惟回籠粉售價、則以各廠限制供應、一般囤戶撑抬尤力居奇不售、致棧單貨行情較前兩日又高數分至一角、計開兵船牌十一元五角半、綠砲車牌十一元八角、老車牌則仍爲十一元二角半、因廠方供給本街之貨、大都均是老車牌子爲多、故市面較他牌爲遜、統市本客成交、共計一萬餘包、粉價前途、一味高貴、生活問題、殊感困難、聞某會有籌商抑止麵麥漲價之消息、但空言何補於事實、且一再破壞禁令、亦莫可如何、此奸商所以敢結成「糧食操縱網」也、</p>
<p>麥價即將出二十元</p>
<p>自操縱麵粉、因而操縱原料之小麥、如此造成麥比粉貴之跡象、前日居然開到二十元百斤小麥、昨市堅俏如常、蓋以出口帮與日廠需胃又濃、故人心莫不向上、如此局面、恐不久即將超越二十元大關也、昨市蘇常錫等麥均開二十元、揚州麥十九元七八角、由華廠福新辦去一千包、及日廠家辦去六車、阜豐廠暫不收進、市面已入醞釀中、</p>
<p>黃豆昨又見新高價</p>
<p>昨日黃豆市况、在一般囤戶猛烈搜羅之下、行市冉創新紀錄、丁家州豆已達二十二元關、照業中人觀察、大局氣象在廢曆年內、勢無辱望、故其登峯造極之人心、仍在熱烈邁進中、昨由港汕囤戶分去丁家州豆一千餘包、價自二十一元六角至二十二元、本街囤戶辦去南京豆五六車、價自十九元五角至二十元、蕪湖豆二百包價爲二十元零六角、及崇明沙黃四百包、價爲二十一元、次爲十八元七角云、</p>

<p>後市壯態依然恬靜、惟市勢略形鬆動、中因港電復來塞予外行現貨美滙七元八一二五、入後外行對於上價頗少吃胃、而反有供意、故迄晚收銀行現貨賣價英金四辦士七〇三一二五、美滙七元八一二五、下月期英金四辦士六四〇六二五、美滙七元六五六二五、結果比上日現期英軋鬆〇一五六二五、美亦軋長〇三一二五、</p>

<h3>至誠待人</h3>
<p>— 黃嘉音</p>
<p>不論做事待人接物，你得以至誠待人。</p>
<p>真誠是性格的標誌，是「貨真價實，童叟無欺」的表示。</p>
<p>沒有人相信不信任自己的人，所以你得以至誠待人。以真誠而信任的態度待人，　人家一定會相信你的。</p>
<p>沒有能力與缺乏智識，有時候倒是可寬知的。可是無誠意却無可寬恕。</p>
<p>讓世人曉得你是正直而真誠的，你的「貨色」是靠得住的，那麼你的「生意」一定興盛，你的「顧客」將絡繹不絕，你將有應接不暇之樂。</p>
<p>真誠不是金錢所買得到的。真誠的人，像吸鐵的磁石一樣，將吸引人物，吸引機會，吸引工作。</p>
<p>也許你昨天失敗了，那不要緊。最要緊的還是今天。今天你將用甚麼態度去待人接物呢？</p>
<p>試用一種新的工具吧。試用一種新的力量——直誠的力量，去待人接物。這樣，你所耗費的心血，一定不是徒然的。你不使人家失望，人家也不會使你失望的。</p>
<p>所以，請以至誠待人！</p>

<h3>漫談自殺</h3>
<p>— 陳師超</p>
<p>自殺是心理學家，社會學家和醫學家當前的一個大問題。自外表看來，自殺的原因，不外乎經濟破產，患不治之病，事業失敗，蒙恥受辱和情場失意。其實，這些都是屬於次要的。要知道其主要原因，必須根究自殺者的個性。因為自找「歸宿」，不是道德怯懦的表現，而是心理和精神方面的矛盾。</p>
<p>以自殺的方法而言，婦女所用的，多為上吊，跳水和服毒。男子則用較粗爆的方法如手鎗刀和劍。惟日本男性也常用上吊竄崖和跳水，其最特別的是切腹。在非洲呢，男子多用槍械，女子則喜服毒。</p>
<p>自殺是一種複雜的動作，必須追究到精神上的因素。當人已屆高齡，前途希望渺茫之時，自然走入自殺一途。多數自殺者，是四十五歲以上的人。男子則比女子多四倍。原因是女子的家庭觀念較重，使她們不得不反對自殺。再則女子受社會，經濟，政治及其他問題的衝激而發生的精神煩惱，不及男人之甚。</p>
<p>就季候而言，夏季為自殺最多之時，而百分八十的自殺是在晝間舉行的。</p>
<p>自殺的主要原因，必須歸究到下意識的深處。因為同樣遭遇一種的不幸，有人會處這泰然，另一種人却非自殺不可，足見決定自殺的原因是主觀的。</p>
<p>人的精神上在不知不覺之間，有多少矛盾的現像在發生着，這種現象，大部份是兒童時代經騐的結果。一個兒童不免有各種願望，但總是失望的多。所以那個兒童就對於阻碍實現其願望的人，大槪是他的父母，發生一種反感，甚至欲其死的願望。</p>
<p>兒童時期受壓抑的死意，以及精神上的反感和仇恨，到了成人，會變成精神痛苦的錯亂，再變而為自我矛盾和殘酷狂終而自殺。費登氏所著的「自殺」書中曾說：『自殺顯然是下意識道德衝動的結果。這種衝動迫使人覺得必須以死自刑。這就是在幼時欲加諸其父母的。因此自殺變成一種公道的報應。語去「不欲人死不致自殺」，就是這個道理』。</p>
<p>凡人的經騐或情緒對共精神健康有不良影響的，必須用精神療法，才能使其心上的不和諧或精神上的矛盾，烟消霧散。</p>
<h3>瘋子的故事</h3>
<p>— 夏楚</p>
<p>歐戰爆發後、德國撤退薩爾淹城各城的公共機關，有一所疫人院也撤退了。據說本來該院的瘋人中有三下四名都自命是希特勒，可是戰事發生之後，這輩瘋人竟自知識相，在撤退時候，只有十二名商人再自稱是希特勒了。</p>
<p>希特勒進兵維也納，心理分析學的鼻祖弗洛依特氏因為是猶太人關係、竟不能安居、惶惶的逃亡倫敦。當時美國有報記載其事，標題大書曰：「瘋人院驅逐醫生了」云。</p>
<p>人物</p>
<h3>德意志名將毛奇</h3>
<p>— 李紹忠</p>
<p>最近我國領袖蔣總裁所發「至全國小學校長教職員及社會人士」電文中，曾引用至毛奇將軍的一段佳話。毛奇將軍在普法戰爭獲勝後，說這次，利應歸功於全國小學教師，一時傳誦，吧為確論。這位毛奇將軍究竟是怎樣的一們人物，讀者一定亟想曉得吧。—編者</p>
<p>德意志陸軍的精銳善戰，自一八七〇的普法之戰後，始名震於世。普法戰役時的主將毛奇，非但是德國陸軍中第一位著名的大帥，而且是現代陸軍史名的大帥，而且現代陸軍史上是優秀的參謀名將之一</p>
<p>毛奇於一八〇〇年十月二十六日出生在一家日耳曼貴族的世家中。他的父俗人在一八〇五年時喬居到疴爾斯德音地方去，成為丹麥的百姓了。但不幸就在那一年上，他的鄉間房屋遭受了『回錄』之災，同時在魯比克鎮上的房屋，又遭到法國人的刦掠，因之家道中衰了，所以年青時代的毛奇　，是在很貧困的環境中成長起來的。一一岸時，他冰被送進丹麥京城一間陸軍學校求學。於一信一八年加入丹麥陸軍。但當二十歲時，他自己決定改入普魯二軍隊服役。二一三歲進高級戰事學社校，畢業時成績非常優　。三一年他被調至柏林參謀要部服務。</p>
<p>毛奇性喜研究文學與歷史，尤喜旅行。他發表過一篇小說「兩朋友」，以及不少關於國際政治地理與戰爭的論文。一八三二年他和一家書店訂約，預備把奇篷氏（Gibbon）衰瑞典沒落，一書譯成德文，版稅七十五鎊，他的計度原是想賺得這筆錢去買一匹好馬。　十八個月裏他譯完了九卷，還剩三卷沒有竣事。但是書店老板沒有能把書印出來，所以毛奇衹拿到二十五鎊的錢。</p>
<p>一八三五年他得到六個月的休假，因去東南歐旅行。在君士坦丁堡短期停留後，他經柏林當局的核准，就留在土耳其軍中用務。在這期間內，他不斷寫信給他的母親和姐姐，這些信件後來經他自己修正一番後，都拿來出版了。他有一位姐姐嫁給一們居留在疴的斯德音的英國人做後妻，好丈夫前妻有位女兒，名叫馬麗　德，在斷母處常常讀到毛奇的來信。當毛氏從國外歸來的瑪麗求婚時，很快地就成功了。婚禮是於一八四一年舉行的。毛氏膝下兩兒。</p>
<p>一八七〇年普法戰爭突然發生，但毛氏早在一八五七年就開始在搜集報告以籌劃應付這次不可避免的戰爭了。因一八八六年普奧戰爭時毛氏戰略的成功，所以更加強他在這一　戰爭中的地位。在一八七〇年七月十五日普魯士及南德軍隊動中令頒發後五天，他就兩任命為大本營參謀總長。次年六月十六日受封為陸軍大元帥。而於一八九一年四月二十四日突然逝世。</p>
<p>心理</p>
<h3>你怕什麼？</h3>
<p>— 羅道愛</p>
<p>人類生來的時候，只有兩種的恐懼：第一，怕跌交，第二，怕大的聲響。後來漸漸長大起來，他便會怕別的東西了。</p>
<p>恐懼會妨碍消化，會擾亂心臟的工作，會影響身體的發育，有時會引起心臟病。許多科學家相信高血壓往往是由於憂慮時受驚所致的。</p>
<p>有一位心理學家研究恐懼，心理的結果，曉得那些生長在當貴家的孩子是比窮家兒童更怕跌交，更怕聲響，更怕疾病，更怕死亡的。</p>
<p>懼怕會使血管收縮，會使面色蒼白，會使心跳得很利害。</p>
<p>心理學家在研究心理學的時候，有一次叫許多的是甚麼。結果有百分之一十五以上的人童年時所怕的是動物。此外，他們所怕的是：意外事件，因意外而受傷，個人的缺點或個人的失敗，獨逢一人在黑暗的地方，以及有痛苦的時候。</p>
<p>有時候小孩也會間接發生恐懼。比方一個小孩從前很喜歡玩弄兔子，當他很開心地和兔兒在一塊玩耍的時候，忽然有一個很大聲音叫他在嚇一跳，他便得到一種不好的印象，從此以後，他看見兔兒便自然會害怕起來。</p>
<p>小孩所在黑暗的地方，這我們不能認為是一件不正常的事情。這是人類傳的天性，因為古你的人類，為了怕敵人來襲擊，所以，每當黑夜的時候，心裏常常存着種種的畏懼</p>
<p>牙醫椅子上的恐懼，恐怕是人類所有恐懼之中的最難制止的了。</p>

<p>求學是一種幸福，也是一樣苦事，非用心刻苦，不是以求心得，什麼「白日通」，「一月通」，究意是不成的。</p>
<p>學問隨時隨地可以求得，經騐是最寶貴的學問。</p>
<p>人人應富求學，若是環境不許跑進學校，可多方面的追求學問。</p>
<p>求學的目的應該是服務社會，若為升官發財而求學，那末一生的學問盡是虛偽。</p>
<p>學問是跟着時代一同前進，要不斷訓練自己，改進自己，才不至於落伍。</p>

<h3>The Sino-Japanese Commercial and Navigation Treaty Expires: The U.S.-Japan Relationship Reaches a Critical Stage; The United States Firmly Maintains the Open Door Policy in the Far East; If Japan Does Not Realize Its Mistakes, Sanctions May Be Imposed at Any Time</h3>
<p>WASHINGTON - The U.S.-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation has been abolished, and there is currently no sign of signing a transitional agreement. Congress has now decided to hand this case over to the State Department. According to the U.S. State Department, the U.S.-Japan commercial treaty was abolished at midnight today (1:00 PM Saturday Shanghai time), while the Japanese side believes that the treaty was abolished at midnight Tokyo time on Friday (10:00 AM this morning). Whitelem, a representative of the Democratic Party in New York, said, "Unless there are no more unexpected events, the United States will never consider signing a new treaty." Democratic Senator Glen also told a Japanese reporter via a long-distance Pacific telephone call, "Negotiations for a new treaty will be suspended because the American public is extremely angry about Japan's infringement of the interests of American expatriates in China." (United Press dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>WASHINGTON - The expiration of the U.S.-Japan commercial treaty has been commented on by diplomatic circles here. It is said that Japan has repeatedly tried to sign at least a temporary agreement with the United States, but to no avail. Once the treaty expires at midnight today, the relationship between the United States and Japan will enter a new stage. Although the current situation cannot be said to change drastically after the two countries enter a state of no treaty, the United States is actually in a superior position and can effectively exert pressure on Japan at any time. The U.S. government's attitude towards Japan has been very firm in recent months. It is generally believed that this is an expression of the U.S. determination to refuse to recognize the "New Order in East Asia." However, in reality, the U.S. attitude has remained consistent since the Manchurian Incident in 1931. In other words, it (1) maintains the Open Door Policy; (2) refuses to recognize all Japanese conquests or annexations, regardless of the form they take; and (3) maintains the integrity of U.S. rights in the Far East. To this day, State Department leaders still believe that Japanese public opinion does not have a correct understanding of U.S. views, which has led to politics still being controlled by the military. It is hoped that public opinion will realize this in time and prompt the Japanese government to change its course. Then the United States is still willing to take a compromising attitude. As for the Japanese government's insistence on going its own way and heading towards suicide, the U.S. government will consider various measures, the nature of which is equivalent to retaliatory measures, and the form of which is no more than the following two types: (1) Banning the transportation of munitions and certain items to Japan. Regarding this, Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Pittman has already drafted a bill that will be submitted to the Senate for discussion. (2) Imposing additional taxes on Japanese imports, which may be increased to 45%. Since the outbreak of the war in Europe, German exports have been blockaded, and all production in the British Empire must be reserved for its own use. Japan's reliance on U.S. supplies is increasing, especially for various raw materials necessary for combat. In addition, Japan's financial situation is extremely unstable. It only maintains its currency with the proceeds from selling silk to the United States. Therefore, if the United States puts commercial pressure on Japan, it will be very effective. However, for the time being, the U.S. government does not intend to change the status quo. When Congress discusses the Pittman embargo bill in the future, the State Department does not intend to put pressure on it, but would rather allow Congress and domestic public opinion to freely express their views. (Havas dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>WASHINGTON - The U.S.-Japan commercial treaty has expired. This treaty was signed in Washington in 1911 and has been in effect for 29 years. According to the treaty, in addition to both parties enjoying most-favored-nation treatment, citizens of the signatory countries may travel, reside, and conduct business within the territory of the other country. However, in reality, since the United States promulgated the Immigration Act of 1907, the entry of Japanese immigrants has been almost completely prohibited. However, in terms of commercial relations, the signatory countries are bound by the most-favored-nation clause, and any restrictions on imports and exports that are not universally applicable to other countries may not be imposed on the other party. The reason why the United States has been unable to prohibit the transportation of munitions and other goods to Japan in the past is because of this. Secretary of State Hull decided on July 26 of last year to notify the Japanese government of the abolition of the treaty in accordance with a clause in the treaty that stipulates that if one of the signatory countries wishes to declare the abolition of the treaty, it should give notice six months in advance. This deadline expired at midnight yesterday. Therefore, from today onwards, the U.S. government can freely implement embargo measures against Japan or commercial restrictions that it deems beneficial. (Havas dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>The United States Seeks Truth from Facts and Forces Japan to Change Its Policy</p>
<p>WASHINGTON - People here are now observing the expiration of the U.S.-Japan commercial treaty with composure. The general attitude is that if the U.S.-Japan trade relationship is not to be placed on a temporary basis starting on Saturday morning, then Tokyo must take the initiative. The impression that the U.S. authorities are seeking truth from facts can now be confirmed by the criticism of the "Washington Post." The newspaper mentioned the expiration of the U.S.-Japan commercial treaty today, saying that January 26 will be the starting point of a brand new and important page in the history of U.S.-Japan relations. Japan has repeatedly infringed on U.S. rights and interests in China without any scruples for more than eight years. The State Department has repeatedly protested against various acts of insult and unfriendliness against the United States, but these protests have never had any effect. Now, in accordance with the general demands of the public, the opportunity to stop supplying military supplies to Japan has arrived. If commerce is interfered with by legislation, the Japanese will know best how serious the damage will be to Japan. Whether the United States will adopt a retaliatory plan to deal with Japan depends solely on Japan's actions in the Far East. At the same time, the "Evening Star" also published the same candid remarks, saying that the Japanese government knew long ago what it had to do to restore the United States' desire to conclude a commercial treaty with Japan. In other words, Japan must restrain itself to change its behavior in China, and the United States will judge it by its actions, not its words. January 26 is a turning point in U.S.-Japan relations, but there is no doubt that only a fundamental change in Japanese policy in terms of psychology and spirit can produce beneficial results.

<p>WASHINGTON - On the eve of the termination of the U.S.-Japan commercial treaty of 1911, American newspapers declared that Japan's actions in the Far East will determine whether the United States will take retaliatory commercial measures. The "New York Journal" stated, "We will maintain the threat of economic pressure to deal with the Tokyo government until the Sino-Japanese war issue can be resolved satisfactorily. Japan cannot, on the one hand, transform the Far East by force and, on the other hand, maintain good relations with the United States and let it act recklessly. The United States must at least sever partial commercial relations with Tokyo." The "New York Sun" stated, "It is still difficult to say whether the State Department's attitude towards Japan will improve or deteriorate in the future. Enlightened people in the United States all agree with the firm position taken by the government on this matter. If the Japanese army, which rules Japan, thinks that the State Department is bluffing or disregards the price (of our notification of the abolition of the U.S.-Japan commercial treaty of 1911), then all the blame will be on them."

<p>Chongqing Newspapers Eagerly Await Further Action by the United States</p>
<p>CHONGQING - This morning, all the newspapers here carried editorials discussing the great significance of the expiration of the U.S.-Japan commercial treaty today. The "Central Daily News" stated that prohibiting the transportation of materials to Japan is the most effective way to curb Japanese aggression against China. This move will surely win the sympathy of the majority of the American people. Sao Dang Bao hopes that the government will abide by the policy of abolishing the treaty and not be moved by Japan's superficial appeasement plans. The "Shishi Xinbao" stated that from today onwards, the U.S. government has adopted an effective plan to curb Japan's expansionist forces in the Far East. (Reuters dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>Japan's Economic Lifeline Is in the Hands of the United States</p>
<p>WASHINGTON - Commerce Secretary Hopkins today issued a long article on U.S.-Japan trade on the day the U.S.-Japan commercial treaty expires. Readers attach great importance to it. The article clearly reveals Japan's dependence on the United States, regarding the United States as a market for selling Japanese goods and as a source of necessary military supplies, especially after the war in Europe disrupted Japan's trade with Europe. In other words, the article indicates that if any development causes obstacles to Japan's normal trade with the United States, then Japan will realize how difficult the situation is. The article traces that in recent years, Japan has ranked third in U.S. trade, both in buying and selling. Japan accounts for 7% of U.S. imports and 8% of U.S. exports. Of Japan's total imports, 34% come from the United States, and of Japan's total exports, 16% to 20% are sold to the United States. It is found that Japan's exports within the Japanese Yen bloc (that is, trade that cannot absorb foreign currency) account for about 40% to 50% of its total. Therefore, Japan's exports to the United States are an important source of foreign currency needed by Japan to purchase raw materials. The United States supplies Japan with about 56% of the important necessities for its heavy industry, 40% of raw cotton, 40% of metals, 50% of machinery, and 65% of petroleum.

<p>WASHINGTON - Republican Congressman Hamilton said today that the U.S.-Japan commercial treaty has now expired, which is a major blow to cotton planters in the United States, as the current situation of cotton planters in the United States is already extremely dire. He also said that since the United States has such a surplus of cotton, it should no longer care about nationality and market price and try to dispose of it. (United Press dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>A Drastic Change Is Expected in the Financial Relationship Between the Two Countries</p>
<p>WASHINGTON - According to financial experts here today, from today onwards, not only has the commercial relationship between the United States and Japan entered a "day-to-day" state, but also its financial relationship has entered a "day-to-day" state. If the amount of Japanese goods purchased by the United States in the future is still large, then the basic financial relationship between the two countries will not change. However, everything is uncertain, because the main commodity for Japan to obtain U.S. foreign exchange is raw silk. If the United States purchases less Japanese raw silk, then a drastic change will occur in the U.S.-Japan financial relationship. (United Press dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>TOKYO - Japanese newspapers unanimously criticized and condemned the United States for the abolition of the U.S.-Japan commercial treaty and demanded that Japan's attitude towards the United States be hardened. "Kokumin Shimbun" said, "The United States' failure to sign a new treaty with Japan is an extremely unfriendly act. Japan will not be responsible for any disputes in the future."

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>How Will the United States Act Against Japan?</h3>
<p>The Sino-Japanese Commercial Treaty, at 12:00 midnight on January 26, 1940, truly, as expected six months ago, ended its mission of twenty-nine years, losing its binding power on the contracting states. Only because of the vast spatial distance, the times between East and West diverged, so that after 10:00 PM on the 26th in Shanghai, the Japanese side regarded the commercial treaty as already abolished, but until 11:00 AM on the 27th in Shanghai, the American side still had to regard this treaty as existing. When the reporter writes here, it is actually between this existence and that abolition; if Chinese characters discuss matters and record time, and must strictly distinguish between past, present, or future, then it is unknown how to use words appropriately. Fortunately, although Japan yearns to maintain the original treaty or replace it with a temporary agreement, the strong and clear attitude of the United States has become even greater from eight years, six months to the recent days; it is known that before 11:00 AM this morning, there is no need to worry about any sudden changes, because the entry of the United States and Japan into a state of no treaty is indeed a predetermined situation, which is worthy of being a premise before the establishment of a theory.</p>
<p>The policies and measures of a democratic country must be based on popular sentiment; however, from general emotions, through the various promotions of newspapers, magazines, speeches, and broadcasts, to the decisions of the parliament and the announcements of the authorities, there are inevitable detours in space and time, and there are also possible setbacks. Therefore, according to dispatches from Washington, it is said that the United States will deal with Japan in the future in no more than two ways: (1) banning the transportation of munitions and certain items to Japan; (2) imposing additional taxes on Japanese imported goods; but which one of these two ways will ultimately be taken? Is it no more than these two ways? When will the first way be taken? These are all questions; moreover, whether to adopt any action can also be a fundamental question. The truth is that where detours and setbacks lie, it is not appropriate to judge rashly until the authorities announce and implement it. Moreover, the severity of the American actions revealed by public opinion must not be limited to the above two ways. Tracing back to after the September 18th Incident in 1931, although American policy has been able to consistently maintain its spirit and arguments, various opinions have been uneven and extremely disparate, thus forming a situation of inaction and contradiction over the past eight or nine years. Finally, because of the protracted resistance of China, the general American people were given time to calmly recognize the Far East problem, accumulating the lessons of suffering contempt, insult, and infringement; therefore, the sentiment of sanctioning violence gradually matured and water flowed to form a channel, and the aggressors have recently come to be seen as having reached the point of being full of evil. Comprehensively considering recent American sentiment, in a negative aspect, there is no longer talk of fearing Japan's retaliation and avoiding a conflict between the United States and Japan, and those who advocate that the United States not interfere in the Far East. In a positive aspect, it is confirmed that Japan relies on the United States in the economic aspect, so the United States can make effective sanctions in the economic aspect; it is confirmed that Japan's ambitions and actions in the Far East have given the United States a great threat, so the United States must deal with it in time, and not leave regret that it cannot bite its navel; it is confirmed that the Far East New Order flaunted by Japan is actually a strategy to exclude other countries from withdrawing from the Far East, so the United States must wait for the Japanese army to withdraw from China; it is confirmed that between the United States and Japan, not only are there various outstanding cases in the political, diplomatic, and economic aspects, which are obstacles to national relations, so it is expected that Japan will change its policies and ideas in the Far East. Such is the public sentiment, and the consequence of the abolition of the treaty today.</p>
<p>What actions the United States will take after the expiration of the U.S.-Japan commercial treaty is not appropriate to judge rashly now; however, there are things that can be asserted, that the American authorities should not be satisfied with the expiration of the commercial treaty and the freedom of action that the United States has obtained against Japan. Because if Japan does not obtain the guarantee of a commercial treaty and can still fully enjoy the same treatment as when the commercial treaty existed, then the abolition of the treaty is completely meaningless, and why go to the trouble of doing this; this is one reason. With the existence of the commercial treaty, Japan can purchase murder weapons in the United States, and although the American authorities have been questioned by various parties, and must not be exempt from the blame of conscience, they have had to tolerate this kind of "legal immoral behavior" due to the constraints of the commercial treaty; since the commercial treaty has been abolished, the United States must know how to correct itself from both legal and moral aspects; this is the second reason. From July 7, 1937 to the present, it has been entirely thanks to the War of Resistance that the overall situation has been supported, otherwise China would have ceased to be a country, and the interests of the United States and other countries in the Far East would have been destroyed long ago; since the United States and China have aligned interests, they should give effective assistance to the War of Resistance, and give effective blows to aggression; after the United States abolishes the U.S.-Japan commercial treaty, it should know that without any action, it will not be able to reap the effects of abolishing the treaty; this is the third reason. In the great international disaster, how can the United States force other countries to have Far East policies that must be in line with the United States, just as other countries cannot force the United States to donate its Far East interests and abandon them while marching in parallel with them; there is a sequence of events, and the situation has its ups and downs, and the United States must know that only by taking the lead in acting righteously and bravely, will other countries no longer be afraid, no longer compromise, and only look to the United States to lead the way, and follow as one; this is the fourth reason. That warmongers impoverish the people and exhaust the army is indeed a fact, but history shows that China has exhausted its wealth to make a desperate gamble, or has acted perversely against other countries in the hope of perishing together, which is possible under the state of being crazy in psychology; then, with the power of a thousand jun, controlling the opportunity first, matters cannot be handled without the United States, and the United States has an unshirkable duty; this is the fifth reason. For these five reasons, although we cannot predict how the United States will act, that it will surely do something is something to be watched with new eyes.</p>

<h3>Military Situation in Southern Shanxi Becomes Deadlocked; Fighting in the Southeast Is Still Fierce</h3>
<p>LUOYANG - The war situation in southern Shanxi has been relatively quiet in recent days due to snow. It is reported that the Japanese troops southeast of Wenxi have increased slightly. The Japanese are still trapped in various places such as Zhenfeng Pagoda and Old Temple, and the Chinese and Japanese forces are in a state of deadlock. The number of Japanese troops in Yicheng, Fushan, and other places is also gradually increasing, and the Chinese army is actively attacking. The war situation in the Shangdang District in southeastern Shanxi seems to be more intense. More than 10,000 Japanese troops in Huguan launched a full-scale invasion of Gaoping on the 13th, and their momentum was quite rampant. The Chinese army advanced step by step, fought hard to intercept, and dealt heavy blows. Especially in the battle of Xihuo Town (east of Yincheng), they charged back and forth and annihilated more than 1,000 Japanese troops, creating a glorious victory.

<h3>The Course of the Victory in Northern Hubei: Japanese Attempt to Seize the Tongbai Mountains in an Effort to Completely Control Their Advantage and Crush China</h3>
<p>Chongqing – Over the past week, the Chinese army in the Tongbai Mountain area north of the Yangtze River has unveiled the most rapid and fierce annihilation battle. In this battle, the Chinese army, with an iron-like attitude, defeated the main force of the Japanese army and crushed their long-prepared vicious attempt. Regarding the annihilation of the Japanese, a certain military spokesperson told a Central News Agency reporter that the Japanese army, entrenched in Changtaiguan, Xinyang, Wushengguan and other places, was constantly subjected to fierce attacks by the Chinese troops in the Tongbai Mountain area. They planned to transfer more than 10,000 infantry, cavalry, and artillery from Xiaogan and Huangpi, and join the Japanese troops in Yingshan and Suixian to invade Yinjia Dian and Gao Cheng in an attempt to seize Tongbai Mountain in one fell swoop, in order to eliminate the threat to Changxin and other places. Certain Chinese troops calmly deployed and lured the Japanese into the Chinese encirclement, and echoed with the Biyang and Zaoyang allied forces to strike from the side. The Japanese army once penetrated deeply on the 18th, reaching Gu Jia Dian and Gao Cheng. Seeing that the time was ripe, the Chinese army launched a full-scale siege on the 19th, braving the bitter wind and snow. After three days and nights of bloody battles, the main force of the Japanese army was annihilated by the Chinese, and Yinjia Dian and Gao Cheng were recaptured. More than 4,000 Japanese corpses were left behind, and 7,000 to 8,000 were wounded. The Chinese also seized six heavy artillery pieces, more than twenty field artillery pieces, and destroyed more than ten Japanese tanks and more than fifty trucks. The brave men of the Chinese army pursued fiercely, and the Japanese casualties were even greater along the way. The importance of this battle is very significant. First, the Chinese army planned to crush the Japanese attempt and inflict the greatest damage on them. Second, the Chinese army will forever maintain a strong posture and superior terrain to control the Japanese army in the Changxin and Wu areas. (25th telegram)</p>
<p>Fancheng – The Japanese army that broke through from Sui North retreated southeast in two routes. The Chinese army intercepted and attacked along the way, killing many.

On the 24th, more than ten sections of the highway between Guanqiao and Dongqiao were destroyed by the Chinese, and more than 100 kilograms of telegraph wires were seized. At the moment, the Jingzhong Road is completely controlled by the Chinese army. (25th telegram)</p>
<p>Xiangyang – The Japanese army that was defeated by the Chinese army near Gao Cheng retreated south on the 22nd. The Chinese army tracked and pursued, and divided into routes to intercept at Houzi Wan, Yuanjia Wan, Xujia Wan, Wanjiadian, Ta'er Wan and other places. After fierce fighting until the morning of the 23rd, all these places were reported to have been recaptured. The Japanese army collapsed step by step, still trapped in heavy encirclement. The various Chinese armies continued to advance bravely, fiercely attacking, and killing more than 3,500 Japanese soldiers by 11 o'clock in the evening. The Japanese army completely lost its will to fight and broke through in different directions to escape. One part fled to Suixian Xihe and other places, and another part fled to Yu Jia Dian. At the moment, the Chinese army is still pursuing closely in separate directions. (25th telegram)</p>
<p>Shashi – The Chinese army advanced towards Guangshui on the 19th, and when it approached the suburbs, it fought the Japanese for three hours, killing many Japanese soldiers.

<h3>Monks, etc. Not Allowed to be Exempted from Military Service</h3>
<p>Chongqing – Today, all Chinese newspapers here published an official announcement from the Ministry of Military Administration, stating that since the current Conscription Law does not have provisions for exemption from military service for Buddhist monks, Catholic priests, and Christian pastors, they will not be allowed to be exempted from military service. It is said that since the implementation of national conscription, monks, priests, and pastors have claimed exemption from military service. The local authorities were unable to make a decision on this matter and submitted a request to the government for a final judgment. (26th Reuters telegram)</p>
<h3>Japanese Malicious Propaganda Aims to Harm the American Ambassador</h3>
<p>Chongqing – Regarding the Shanghai Japanese military spokesperson's claim that the Chinese side's plot to sink the American ambassador's ship "Luzon" has been discovered, the Chinese side here believes that this is the Japanese side's confession of deliberately sinking the "Luzon." Because the US-Japan Commercial Treaty has now expired, anti-American sentiment is extremely high, so they plan to sink the "Luzon" to vent their anger. Moreover, this type of action is not without precedent, such as the sinking of the American gunboat "Panay," the attack on the British gunboat "Ladybird," and the British Ambassador to China, Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, being strafed by Japanese aircraft, are all good examples. As for their accusation that the Chinese side has this plan, it is nothing more than trying to shirk responsibility. At the same time, the American Embassy here also believes that there is absolutely no knowledge of this plot. (26th United Press telegram)</p>

<h3>The Chinese Army is Active on the Ping-Sui Line: Pingdiquan Station is Attacked and Bao Tou is Besieged Again by Chinese Forces</h3>
<p>Xingji – The Chinese army on the Ping-Sui Line is extremely active. Pingdiquan Station was attacked by the Chinese army on the morning of the 17th, and suffered great damage. The Chinese army in Daqingshan also took the opportunity to attack. On the morning of the 18th, they first destroyed the Chasuqi Station, and then dismantled several miles of railway near Bikqi. The Ping-Sui transportation has now been interrupted. More than 10,000 Chinese troops in the Sui Fourth Route advanced in separate directions. One part arrived at Subente, and the main force drove east from the south. The vanguard was only four miles away from Baotou. Another part arrived at Lisha and attacked Nanyang Yang near Baotou. Another part of the Chinese army actively advanced towards Baobei, changing to attack and capture Xincheng. At the moment, Baotou has been besieged again by the Chinese army, and the battle situation is progressing fiercely. (25th telegram)</p>
<h3>Wang Jingwei and Liang Hongzhi Will Issue a Declaration</h3>
<p>Qingdao – Wang Jingwei issued a public statement yesterday, saying that all the important issues raised at the meeting here have been resolved. Wang, Wang Kemin, and Liang Hongzhi will issue a declaration tomorrow. After Wang reports on the situation of the Sino-Japanese negotiations, a decision will be made to convene another meeting. (26th Reuters telegram)</p>
<p>Qingdao – Lieutenant Colonel Mabuchi, an official spokesperson for the Japanese, told reporters yesterday that although the meeting will continue, most of the important issues have already been decided. Wang Jingwei has now obtained undeniable evidence that another meeting to be held in the future will be quite promising. The "Central Political Conference" will be convened as soon as possible. Personnel from the "Provisional" and "Reformed" governments, influential figures from the outside world, and even members of the "Old Kuomintang" will be invited to participate in order to help organize the "New Government." Someone asked where the "New Government" will be located, whether it will be in Nanjing. The spokesperson replied, "The location of the 'New Government' is not difficult to imagine," but it is not appropriate to decide on this issue at the current meeting. Regarding the issue of the new national flag, there is much controversy. The "New Government" will continue to use the Kuomintang's Blue Sky White Sun flag, but this matter has been discussed, and even some Japanese oppose it, because the Kuomintang flag has been a symbol of hostility and opposition to Japan's purposes in China. The spokesperson also said that if the Kuomintang and Chiang Kai-shek can abandon cooperation with communism and no longer hate Japan, then not only the Blue Sky White Sun flag, but even the Kuomintang itself, will be adopted. Wang is now trying to promote the true revival of Sun Yat-sen's ideology to rebuild his work. Japan has discovered that some things are the same as its policies, so in the Konoe Declaration of December 20, 1938, there was a passage saying that what Japan desires is not to conquer China, but to seek its cooperation with Japan.

<h3>The "July 7th" Cotton Spinning Machine is Highly Effective</h3>
<p>Chongqing – The Agricultural Production Promotion Committee has been promoting the improvement of the "July 7th" cotton spinning machine to various places for the past year and a half in order to alleviate the yarn shortage in the rear, and it has been quite effective. Taking Sichuan as an example, according to a report from the Sichuan Cotton Spinning Machine Promotion Committee, as of the end of November last year, 21,000 "July 7th" cotton spinning machines have been promoted in 84 counties in Sichuan Province. Rural women can spin two pounds of yarn in ten hours of work per machine, earning about one yuan in profit. From a low estimate, 20,000 large bales of yarn can be spun throughout the year, saving 2 million yuan in capital outflow. If electricity or water power is used to drive the machine, each machine can spin three and a half pounds of yarn per day. Moreover, most of the machine is made of wood, so the cost is lower, which is in line with the needs of rural areas. The Agricultural Production Promotion Committee is currently collecting reports from all parties and requesting experts to continue research to improve the machine. (24th telegram)</p>

<h3>The Neutrality of the Netherlands and Belgium is in Fact Fulfilling Their Responsibility to Europe; the Dutch Parliament Debates Churchill's Speech; the Foreign Minister Declares that They Will Resist Any Provocative Actions; the Status of Europe and Asia Does Not Allow Powerful Countries to Sit By and Watch Its Transformation</h3>
<p>The Hague – A debate arose during the Dutch Parliament's meeting, criticizing Churchill's broadcast speech last Saturday. The Dutch Foreign Minister, Kleffens, responded that the country is now united in supporting the government's neutrality policy, and the actions taken by the authorities to prevent those who violate neutrality are in complete compliance with international law. The Netherlands' adherence to neutrality is in fact fulfilling its responsibility to Europe, because if the Netherlands and Belgium participate in the war, the European affairs will become even more complicated. If anyone wages war against us, we will respond with force. Recently, someone raised the point that member states of the League of Nations that adhere to neutrality have a legal obligation to participate in the war. In fact, neutral member states have absolutely no legal or moral obligation to participate in the war. If this kind of one-sided remarks continue, it will eventually be difficult for neutral member states to be member states of the League of Nations. However, the time for small and weak countries to withdraw from the League of Nations has not yet arrived, and there is still hope that the League of Nations may change its course. The Netherlands and Belgium have become components of European order and stability. What the Netherlands and Belgium entrust is a well-founded promise and foreign public opinion, that is, the status of the Netherlands in Europe and Asia does not allow any powerful country to sit by and watch its land be transferred to others. Has the time for a fair and wise resolution of European problems not yet arrived? He cannot agree with those who lightly discuss the possibility of neutral countries being attacked.

<p>Brussels – Responsible officials here do not attach importance to the rumor that Italy is now planning to organize a group of neutral countries including Belgium and the Netherlands, with Italy taking the leading position. They also expressed their views on Prime Minister Chamberlain's reaffirmation in the House of Commons of Britain's guarantee to Belgium, saying that if this country is invaded and asks the guarantors for help, Britain will assist Belgium with the greatest speed and efficiency, which has long been known to all.

<h3>German Submarines are Constantly Active, Attacking Ships of Various Countries; French, Turkish, and Swedish Ships Sunk; German Cargo Ship Scuttled After Being Intercepted</h3>
<p>Paris – Naval sources say that in the past ten days, the attacks by German submarines on ships of various countries have re-emerged, especially in the North Sea. Ships of various countries, regardless of whether they are warships or merchant ships, and regardless of whether they belong to neutral countries, are subject to indiscriminate attacks. As a result, after the ships are sunk, there is often no trace to be found. In total, since the 18th of this month, in addition to the loss of two British destroyers, no fewer than sixteen ordinary ships of various countries have been torpedoed, but British ships account for only six of them, and there are also two small fishing boats included. German submarines attack ships without issuing a warning in advance, and the torpedoes they launch are very powerful. The ships that are hit often sink within a few minutes. Most of the crew and passengers do not have time to lower the lifeboats and are drowned. Those who are not killed by the explosions either jump into the sea to commit suicide or float on the sea with broken wood. As a result, many also die of cold and starvation.

<h3>Germany Prepares to Expand the War to Seize the Near East; Iran Denies that Four Countries Have Concluded a Military Alliance</h3>

They are now preparing to expand military operations in the Caucasus, Iraq, Iran, and Arabia in the near future. The newspaper said that this is a warning to Britain and France.

<h3>Soviet Army Attempts to Outflank the Left Wing of the Mannerheim Line; No Progress for the Soviets on Lake Ladoga; Germany Decides to Maintain Neutrality Towards the Soviet-Finnish War</h3>
<p>Helsinki – According to a public statement here today, in the northeast of Lake Ladoga, from Wednesday to Friday morning, the Soviet army attacked the Finnish troops continuously, but until this morning, the Finnish army's position has not been shaken. The purpose of the Soviet army's offensive is to encircle the rear of the Mannerheim Line's left wing. Soviet officers ordered their soldiers to carry out night raids. The Finnish military is quite doubtful about whether the Soviet army has the strength to continue its offensive, and at the same time, they believe that the Soviet army will collapse and be unable to occupy important areas. (26th Havas telegram)</p>
<p>Helsinki – The Finnish and Soviet armies fought fiercely all day yesterday north of Lake Ladoga. According to the latest public statement, the main purpose of the Soviet army's offensive is to flank the Mannerheim Line and defense line, but there has been no progress, because the Soviet army's attacks have been repelled and suffered heavy losses. The fighting in the Aittojoki area was the most fierce yesterday. The Soviet army also began attacking Kollaanjoki intermittently yesterday, and it did not end until night, but it was repelled before dawn. The Soviet army has lost hundreds more people in recent battles. The situation in the Karelian Isthmus is relatively calm. Both sides' activities are limited to reconnaissance and artillery harassment. In the Lapland region, the Soviet army's attack on the Finnish army's position in Mekkajärvi has been repelled.

<h3>The "Asama Maru" Incident; Britain Will Reply to Japan's Protest; Explains that Britain's Actions are Legal; Willing to Follow Diplomatic Channels to Resolve the Issue</h3>
<p>London – Regarding the Japanese mail ship "Asama Maru" case, well-informed sources here recently announced that the British reply has been sent to the Japanese government by the British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie. Its content only explains that Britain's attitude towards this case is justified, but it does not involve how to resolve it, and it will probably be left to Britain and Japan to exchange opinions and seek solutions through diplomatic channels. People in diplomatic circles said that if Japanese shipping companies can agree that they will no longer transport German people of military age in the future, then once the emotions aroused by Japan in this case have eased, the two countries will be able to find a basis for coordination. However, the British government is willing to compromise with Japan not because of reason, but because it wants to avoid tension in British-Japanese relations, and this condition must be that Japan does not assist German interests. In short, Britain will take a firm attitude whenever it involves German interests, even towards neutral countries. Even with the United States, which has always been a friendly country of Britain, Britain has had to reject the requests made by the United States when they violate the interests of Britain and France or international law. This can be seen from the American Continental Security Zone and the American protest against the inspection of mail. Japan should understand this. (25th Havas telegram)</p>
<p>Chongqing – The Chinese Communist Party's mouthpiece, "Xinhua Daily," wrote this morning that the Asama Maru incident is just an excuse for Japan to launch an anti-British movement and force Britain to continue to make concessions in the Far East. Japanese news is working hard to befriend the Soviet Union and the United States, while at the same time trying to cater to the wishes of the Japanese army and will adopt an anti-British policy. Since its failure at Nomonhan, Japan has had to temporarily suspend its expansion to the north and is trying to force Britain to help it resolve the China incident, and will also strengthen its policy of southward expansion. The newspaper predicted that Japan's anti-British movement will continue to increase, and Britain will continue to make concessions. The newspaper warned the Chinese not to expect Britain to help China, and advocated closer relations between China and the Soviet Union. (26th Reuters telegram)</p>
<h3>Tokyo Residents Demonstrate Against Britain; Japanese Military Newspaper Predicts Britain Will Concede</h3>
<p>Hong Kong – Tokyo telegram: Due to the "Asama Maru" incident, people from all walks of life in Japan went to the British Embassy to demonstrate and protest to the British side. Thirty representatives from the Tokyo City Council sent a resolution of the council to the First Secretary of the British Ambassador, etc. in the Marunouchi district yesterday. Also, this Wednesday, 100 members of the Japanese Boys' Group went to demonstrate in front of the British Embassy, demanding the return of the German sailors and the removal of British warships near the Sea of Japan. On the same afternoon, 13 representatives of the Newsboy Sports Movement went to the British Embassy to protest. (26th telegram)</p>
<p>Tokyo – "Kokumin Shimbun" wrote a commentary today, attacking the Yonai Cabinet. The newspaper said that the Asama Maru incident was entirely caused by the Yonai Cabinet's pro-British policy. We expect the British side to finally make concessions to Japan so that Prime Minister Yonai can obtain a diplomatic victory, thereby consolidating the position of the pro-British cabinet. This tactic is obviously a conspiracy. (26th United Press telegram)</p>

<h3>The Philippines Does Not Fear Invasion; If Anyone Dares to Take the Risk, They Will Suffer a Severe Blow</h3>
<p>Manila – According to General MacArthur, the current military advisor to the Philippines and former Chief of Staff of the United States Army, speaking to a reporter from the Manila "Hochi Shimbun," although we believe that no country has the ambition to invade the Philippines, the Philippines will not be difficult to defend itself if another country invades. The Philippines is located at the intersection of Europe and Asia. Merchant ships coming from Europe must pass through or near the Philippines, so the safety of the Philippines is of common concern to major countries. Therefore, if any country dares to risk taking it, it will cause a serious reaction in the world, the nature of which is difficult to predict at present. This is the first point. Secondly, invading the Philippines requires a long-distance sea expedition, which is not easy. In addition, the coast of the Philippines is defensible, so the invasion is extremely dangerous. This is the second point. According to MacArthur, if a country attempts to occupy the Philippine Islands, Britain will have to come out to defend them in order to maintain its imperial routes.

<h3>German Troops Approach Romanian Border: Italian Circles Pay Close Attention to Italy's Balkan and Danube Policies</h3>
<p>Rome: The news that German troops have arrived in the Soviet-occupied eastern part of Galicia Province in Poland, approaching the Romanian border, has drawn close attention from all circles in Italy. According to political figures, recent developments may significantly alter Italy's current policies in the Balkan Peninsula and Danube River basin. This is because Germany is now taking advantage of the difficulties encountered by the Soviet Union in Finland and has obtained its consent to send troops to the foothills of the Carpathian Mountains, poised to replace the Soviet Union in that position. The impact of this is that Hungary is no longer in direct contact with the Soviet Union. If German troops want to attack Romania, they can directly invade without having to go through Hungary. For this reason, Italy no longer needs to consider both maintaining Hungary's territorial integrity and maintaining Hungary's territorial integrity, as well as maintaining Hungary's political independence from Germany and the Soviet Union. Moreover, since Hungarian independence is no longer secure, Italy's reasons for opposing Soviet threats to Hungary in the future will no longer be as firm as before. There is also no need for Romania and Hungary to establish temporary arrangements. Furthermore, if the Soviet Union occupies Romania's Bessarabia province, while Germany also develops its forces towards the Black Sea through various countries and seizes the oil fields in Romania's Prahova River basin, Hungary's territorial demands on Romania (Romania's Outer Transylvania province belonged to Hungary before the last European war) may be realized. It is held that this matter will inevitably provoke a reaction from Britain and France, and Turkey may also be unable to sit idly by, which must be taken into consideration. (Havas report, 25th)</p>

<h3>US and Japan in Treaty-less State: Commerce Door Half-Closed: Publication of the Course of Negotiations Between Tokyo and Washington: Internal Anxiety and Hope for Renewal of New Treaty</h3>
<p>Tokyo: The US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation finally expired at 12:00 PM on January 25. From January 26, it has entered a state of treaty-less relations. The Japanese government, in order to clarify the course of negotiations since the US announced the abandonment of the Treaty of Commerce on the morning of January 26, the Japanese government's attitude towards the state of treaty-less relations, and Japan's views on negotiating a new treaty, issued the following statement through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs: On July 26, Showa 14 (1939), the US government, through its ambassador to Japan, notified the Japanese government that the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation concluded in Washington on February 21, Meiji 44 (1911), had points that needed to be newly considered. To open a path for research and to respond to new circumstances, the US requested the termination of the treaty with six months' notice, with the aim of further upholding American interests. However, the US government's intention was nothing more than to use this as a resource for resolving various issues that had arisen between Japan and the US regarding the China Incident. The Japanese government, recognizing the importance of the trade relationship between Japan and the US, and the Japanese government's policy of not excluding the fair and appropriate interests of the US and other third countries in dealing with the current incident, firmly believes in the construction of a "New Order in East Asia" and hopes for its active efforts. Thinking to more thoroughly communicate Japan's position to the US, and to adjust relations between the two countries in a way that suits both parties, Japan continued to make great efforts and to conclude a new treaty, at the very least to prevent the occurrence of a treaty-less state. Although arrangements were made for negotiations related to this, unfortunately, no compromise was reached, so that after the 26th, it entered a state of treaty-less relations. In order to prevent the US-Japan trade relationship from suffering losses, the US Treasury Department and Commerce Department issued orders last year stating that after the treaty's expiration, there would be no collection of ad valorem tax of 10% on goods loaded on Japanese ships, and the Japanese government has no intention of treating American goods and ships differently. Necessary measures have been taken to ensure that the US-Japan trade relationship will not undergo any substantial changes during this treaty-less period. Furthermore, regarding the qualifications recognized by the treaty, the US will treat Japanese nationals residing or traveling to the US as ordinary temporary travelers, but this will not cause any particular obstacles. Based on the above, there is currently no major change in the trade relationship between the two countries. However, the state of treaty-less relations is unstable and is not desired by either Japan or the US. Therefore, the Japanese government will continue the ongoing negotiations in order to restore the normal state of treaty relations between the two countries. (DPA report, 26th)</p>
<h3>Oriental Daily News Commentary: Worries About the Future</h3>
<p>Hong Kong: Tokyo dispatch. Today, the US-Japan Commercial Treaty expired. The English-language Japan Times commented that when the commercial treaty was in effect, Japanese merchants in the US had the status of commercial representatives and were protected by the treaty and immigration laws. They could reside in the US and remain in normal business until they were transferred elsewhere. However, their current status is very different from yesterday. They are now treated as ordinary travelers, with their length of stay limited to six months. Although they can apply for an extension every six months, the total time cannot exceed two years. Furthermore, in the absence of a treaty, no traveler can be sure whether they will be allowed to stay for more than six months. Due to the above situation, observers are wondering what actions Japan will take. Some people advocate retaliatory measures, which is very likely. Japanese nationals who have a vested interest in this matter are already in a difficult situation and will inevitably demand retaliation. At the same time, the government's measures must also comply with public opinion. As the US Ambassador said in his speech last October, Japanese residents have already lost their treaty status and can only request a six-month residency permit from the US government. American residents in Japan will also be in the same situation. Foreign residents in Japan were required by the government to register last June, with a term of one year. After the expiration, American and other foreign residents must leave the country unless the government re-approves their stay. At the same time, the same measures will be implemented in Manchuria and other Japanese-occupied areas, etc. Newspapers affiliated with Asahi Shimbun commented that although both the Japanese and US governments have taken measures to eliminate commercial obstacles and continue to implement business as usual even after the commercial treaty expires, they hope that the US can reconsider its attitude and express its goodwill in adjusting US-Japan relations, thereby ensuring peace in the Pacific and its own interests in East Asia, etc. Newspapers affiliated with the Nichinichi Shimbun believe that the US has no sincerity in preventing the occurrence of a treaty-less state and that its motive seems to be to delay the resolution of the China issue, to unite with Britain and France after the end of the European war to pressure Japan again. At the same time, the US is attempting to use all its economic resources to prevent the smooth progress of Japan's continental policy, etc. "Kokumin Shimbun" warned the US that the treaty-less state risks severing diplomatic relations between the two countries and urged the entire country to face the situation with a firm determination, etc. (Dispatch of the 26th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Commander in Tianjin Threatens the US</h3>
<p>Tianjin: Lieutenant General Honma, the commander of the Japanese forces stationed in Tianjin, warned the United States in a solo interview with a reporter from the United Press today, stating that Japan would never change its policy in China. If the United States imposed an embargo on the export of military materials to Japan, Japan would have to consider its attitude towards the United States. Honma stated that the Japanese forces in North China were not afraid of the US increasing its naval power in the Pacific, but he did not believe that war between Japan and the US was possible. Honma also stated that when the 1911 US-Japan Commercial Treaty expired, "If the United States disregards Japan's goodwill towards the United States and does not respond, the Japanese military authorities will have to review the situation and take appropriate steps, such as placing the United States' commercial interests in North China under the same restrictions as those of Britain and France." However, he clarified that the expiration of the US-Japan Commercial Treaty does not necessarily mean a tightening of restrictions on American commerce, but stated that if the United States implements an embargo as a final decision against Japan, "I feel that Japan has no reason to treat the American people better than the people of other countries." Honma then criticized the United States' attitude towards Japan's invasion of China, stating, "I feel that the American people are prepared to view any action taken by the Japanese army in China with malice, or perhaps this is a deliberate misunderstanding of Japan by the American people." However, Honma hoped that relations between the two countries could improve and that war between Japan and the US was impossible. Therefore, Honma repeatedly asked the American people, "What is the reason that the differences between Japan and the US cannot be resolved through negotiations? I do not believe that a US-Japan war is possible." The United Press reporter then asked Honma whether the US-Japan crisis would ultimately be resolved through compromise by both sides or by one side surrendering. Honma replied that Japan would never change its current policy. Although the United States misunderstands Japan's policy of building a "New Order in East Asia," nothing in the world can persuade Japan to abandon or change its established policy. Japan has sacrificed 70,000 lives to build the "New Order in East Asia," so it cannot consider changing its policy. The New Order in East Asia is important to both the US and Japan, so the United States must cooperate with Japan. Japan is not afraid of trading with the Soviet Union and is pleased to do so, but if the United States actually imposes an embargo on Japan, Japan will be forced to trade with the Soviet Union to obtain important military supplies. The Japanese military authorities in Tianjin have not yet imposed commercial restrictions on the United States. If the American people feel that they are subject to restrictions, they must recognize the existence of "large-scale hostile acts" in China. They can then understand that these restrictions are unavoidable. Some restrictions are inevitable. Honma also said that the leather needed by the Japanese army cannot be purchased from the United States due to a lack of foreign exchange, so it must be obtained in China. While criticizing the United States' attitude toward Japan's invasion of China, Honma claimed that he had recently received an anonymous letter from the United States requesting the Japanese officers to withdraw from New York. The letter stated that Japan had established an "Army Headquarters" in New York. The letter advised Japan to withdraw its military officers and kill them. The letter accused the Japanese officers of being spies. Therefore, Honma pointed to this as an example of the United States not understanding Japan, as the Japanese officers in New York were purchasing military supplies for the Japanese army.

<h3>British-American Relations Cannot Be Alienated: A Japanese-Soviet Union Alliance Appears Difficult to Achieve</h3>
<p>Washington: Political figures here attach great importance to the expiration of the US-Japan commercial treaty, and they all believe that the United States' termination of the treaty is a result of Japan's invasion of China. Although Japan has made some concessions to the United States, such as promising to open up the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, in an attempt to begin negotiations on a new commercial treaty with the United States, in practice, the country has not done anything about the new commercial treaty. Although the United States currently has no intention of adopting discriminatory measures against Japan in commerce, political figures believe that from now on, the United States government can take such actions at any time and will no longer be legally bound in any way. Some people, seeing the firm attitude of the United States, took the opportunity to issue a statement stating that the policies pursued by Britain are completely different from those of the United States and that a secret agreement has been reached between Britain and Japan. The intention is clearly to alienate Britain and the United States, but the authorities have firmly denied it, and no one believes it. On the other hand, even if the US-Japan commercial relationship cannot be resolved satisfactorily in the future, Japan may not necessarily form a further alliance with the Soviet Union.

<h3>Divide the Pacific and Far East into New Economic Spheres of Influence: Grant Substantial Interests to Japan: Advocate of US Rear Admiral Yarnell</h3>
<p>New York: Former commander of the US Asiatic Fleet, Rear Admiral Yarnell, told reporters that the US-Japan commercial treaty abolished today is the beginning of the resolution of events in the Far East. Yarnell continued that he fully agreed with the prohibition of goods being transported to Japan, but that countries should give Japan a way out in the Pacific in order to weaken Japan's power in China. Rear Admiral Yarnell has also drafted a new map of the economic division of the Pacific. The map stipulates that Britain, France, the Netherlands, and the United States should cede substantial interests to Japan in the Pacific. Rear Admiral Yarnell believes that if countries allow Japan to obtain equal trading opportunities in India, Annam, the Dutch East Indies, and the Philippines, Japanese liberals will be able to prevent the aggression of the military.

<h3>A Record of Tracing the Footprints of the Kunlun Campaign: The Strong Wind at the Top of the Mountain Cannot Sweep Away the Stench of Japanese Corpses: Japanese Troops Tenaciously Defend Batang to Prevent Chinese Troops from Advancing: The Perilous Terrain of Kunlun Pass is Sometimes Evidence</h3>
<p>Treading on the sound to complete the broken stones, you walk on the road from the right hand side, the car is waiting nearby, after boarding the car, all the way bumpy downhill, you can directly reach Nanning. Knowing that Commander Du wants to inspect the observation post on the ××× Heights, because he climbed ×× Mountain, it was already sunset, so he went straight up along the × telephone lines of the observation post. This is also where the Japanese stubbornly resisted. Although the evening wind on the top of the mountain is strong, it still cannot sweep away the smell of foreign corpses in the Chinese land. The Japanese warlords originally regarded the lives of soldiers as weeds, but they have always taken the ashes of corpses very seriously. In the Battle of Kunlun Pass, even this point could not be taken care of. We can imagine one aspect of the Japanese army's embarrassment at that time.</p>
<p>The night is thicker, and the sound of machine guns below the mountain is more intense. The Chinese artillery near Kunlun Pass constantly fired ×× mortars at Batang, and the sound of the mountain and valley echoed, creating a mighty momentum. We walked into the observation post.</p>
<p>The staff officer came out of the bunker, and in the starlight, he could still vaguely see his tall figure and weathered face. He said with a smile, "The Japanese artillery is very weak, and the ammunition also seems to be limited. When it fires at our position, it immediately falls silent after our side fires, not daring to fight back. The Chinese artillery overwhelmed the Japanese artillery. The Battle of Kunlun Pass can be said to be the first time."</p>
<p>Behind the small highland in the southwest direction at nine o'clock, there were two fires. Staff Officer × said, "That is the effect of the 50+ bombs dropped by the Japanese aircraft at noon today, causing the grass and trees on these two barren mountains to burn." He talked about the activities of the Japanese aircraft at the front, "One day, the Japanese aircraft dropped more than 100 bombs on our position, but only two brothers were injured. Airplanes cannot threaten us, and we do not necessarily need air cover. In this attack on Kunlun Pass, our artillery still effectively fired on the Japanese position under the circling of Japanese aircraft, and the artillery position was never discovered by the Japanese."</p>
<p>Our artillery continued to fire, and the shells streaked across the night sky, roaring like a long whistle, also like crazy laughter. The concentration of fire from the ×× guns caused a faint red color to appear above Batang, gradually increasing and expanding. The artillery observer reported, "Batang is on fire, and our army is one kilometer away from Batang town."</p>
<p>Commander Du was talking with the commander of the attacking Batang troops at the observation post, knowing that the two wings were progressing very quickly. He pointed to the sparks of the signal gun rising constantly in the distance and said, "That was fired by our vanguard troops. We have completely controlled Batang, but the Japanese are determined to defend Batang to the death, because Batang is the throat of Nanning south of Kunlun Pass. By defending this throat to the death, they can prevent the advance of our army on the front."</p>
<p>It was late at night, and Commander Du told me to go down the mountain first. I groped in the darkness for the telephone line and returned to the road along the original path. I carried the password of the day and passed the second line of sentry posts. The car circled around Kunlun Pass and saw that the old Japanese fortifications already had brothers resting in them. Some twenty or thirty or twenty people were warming themselves around the campfire, talking and laughing. Some were still reading the books, newspapers, and New Year's cards sent by the Guilin press delegation to the front line. They seemed very eager to know many things in the world.</p>
<p>Near ××, a strong scene shot from across the way, the symphony of horse and infinite track, made me realize that the tanks of East China were continuing to advance, and the camouflage made them even bigger. The iron door in front of the driver was open, and the gunner leaned on the turret and waved to the infantry on the side of the road, exchanging cheers of congratulations. "Win the battle!" "Eliminate the enemy!" The sound waves, like tides, rose and fell, echoing and impacting in the valley. This is an unparalleled happiness, and it is also an unparalleled power. We will use this power to fight the invaders. When I returned to the command post, this iron team seemed to be still roaring in this place, hoping to step on their tracks again to Kunlun Pass soon, to Nanning, to the occupied land, and to all the occupied land.

<p>Xuzhou Notification: On December 29th of last year, at 11:00 PM, Han Guangda, the chief of the 2nd District of Tongshan, led the 4th Squadron, the Independent Squadron, and the Quan and Ban Detachment to the south of Liguo Station, to the Xiao Gu area of Ba Hei Xu in the north, to destroy the Jinpu Railway. Machine guns were set up on both sides. After nailing down a few, after the Japanese patrol train passed, the track spikes on both ends were completely removed, and the tracks were overturned. A No. 102 Japanese train heading north from Xuzhou was overturned. The Chinese ambush troops concentrated their fire. After the train derailed, it was about paces away from the roadbed. The coal box pressed against the locomotive, followed by the mail car, and then successively crashed and destroyed. There were two baggage cars, one second-class car, and three passenger cars. The next day, according to Li Fucheng, a villager from Huangshan Village, Yanhu Township, 2nd District, who was riding on the train, two Japanese and one puppet were killed on the locomotive. On the guard car, the Japanese lieutenant platoon leader was killed, along with two Japanese soldiers. The Japanese businessmen who were killed or wounded in the other cars were all dragged to Xuzhou that night and could not be counted. However, 147 shoes were found inside and outside the wrecked cars, and the total number is estimated to be over 70. Traffic was not restored until 5:00 PM on the 30th. The Commander-in-Chief of the Su-Lu War Zone was reported and immediately ordered the Dongyi Commander to commend the unit for its actions.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops in Northern Jiangsu Suddenly Invade Liangtai; Chinese Forces Counterattack and Surround Xianshao, Also Recapturing Yiling and Zhuanqiao; Japanese Planes Continuously Bomb Taixian</h3>
<p>Northern Jiangsu Correspondence: The Japanese troops in various locations, including Yangzhou, Zhenjiang, and Jiangyin, have recently been dealt blows by Chinese forces attacking Rugao, Xianshao, and Jijiashi, resulting in favorable outcomes. Feeling greatly threatened, the Japanese army has been shifting and consolidating its forces, dispatching over a dozen warships to simultaneously invade Yangzhong, Taixian, and Taiyu counties, while also sending air support to assist in the battle. On the 14th, Japanese warships anchored near Yangzhong County, simultaneously reinforcing Yangshao. At Tianxingqiao, Longwokou, and other locations, multiple small Japanese steamships forcefully landed troops. At dawn on the 15th, Japanese troops at various locations launched simultaneous attacks, advancing in three routes. The comprehensive battlefield situation of each route is as follows:</p>
<p>Xianshao Front</p>
<p>Starting on the 15th, around three to four hundred Japanese soldiers from Shaobo and five to six hundred from Xiannvmiao, along with over a dozen artillery pieces, combined forces and launched concentrated attacks on Chinese army positions at Zhuanqiao and Yiling. The Chinese army mounted a strong resistance. The Japanese army then used dense artillery fire to destroy Chinese positions in Zhuanqiao and Yiling. After holding out until noon, the Chinese army, lacking defensible terrain, shifted its positions to the vicinity of ××. The Japanese army then occupied the Baita River. In the afternoon, Chinese reinforcements launched a surprise flanking attack, advancing towards Xiannvmiao, causing the Japanese troops advancing towards Taixian to feel threatened by a pincer movement and refrain from venturing deeper. The Baita River was also recaptured by the Chinese army. On the morning of the 16th, the Chinese army continued its pursuit, with high morale, and by the afternoon, had surrounded the Japanese troops near Yiling. The battle was intense. At dawn on the 17th, the Chinese army launched a general counterattack on this front, with the ××× unit being particularly brave, repeatedly charging the Japanese positions. The Japanese army stubbornly resisted in the Yiling and Zhuanqiao areas, but ultimately, due to the Chinese army's relentless bayonet charges, the Japanese were unable to withstand the attacks and collapsed, retreating in disarray. After six or seven hours of bloody battle, Yiling and Zhuanqiao were officially recaptured by the Chinese army. The remaining Japanese troops fled back to their original strongholds in Xiannvmiao and Shaobo. As of 1 PM on the 17th, the Chinese army had restored its original positions on the western front. The Japanese army suffered heavy casualties in this battle, with many bodies left unrecovered. The Chinese army also suffered heroic sacrifices. The old positions are currently being reinforced to secure them, while plans are underway to pursue the Japanese army and encircle Xiannvmiao and Shaobo on the morning of the 18th.</p>
<p>Kouan Front</p>
<p>The dozen or so Japanese warships surrounding Yangzhong engaged in fierce battles with the Chinese army on the 15th. A portion of the Japanese warships sailed to the north bank at 6 AM on the 15th, using several dozen steamships to land marines at Longwokou, who then advanced north. The Chinese army units stationed at Kouan immediately launched a head-on assault, resulting in fierce fighting. The Japanese army utilized naval gunfire from Yangtze River warships to cover their assault on Chinese positions, with three Japanese planes circling overhead providing support by strafing with machine guns, making it difficult for the Chinese army to maneuver. Kouan, Diajiapu, and  Husou were forced to defend the area as far as Sixiangkou, over ten li away from Taixian. In the afternoon, Chinese reinforcements arrived and launched flanking attacks from both sides, attempting to encircle the Japanese troops. The Japanese army did not dare to advance further and retreated. That evening, Diajiapu was recaptured by the Chinese army. The Japanese unit retreated to Kouan and Longwokou, where they landed. On the 16th and 17th, the Chinese army counterattacked the Japanese army, with intense fighting. However, because the Japanese warships were positioned in the Yangtze River, their effective firing range was sufficient to provide cover, resulting in intense artillery fire. Three Japanese planes also continuously provided support from the air. As the Chinese army's offensive was not very successful, they remained in a stalemate with the Japanese army between Diajiapu and Kouan. On the morning of the 18th, the two sides only made brief contact, and the fighting was not very intense. Because the Japanese army continued to use naval gunfire for cover, they stubbornly defended their strongholds at Kouan and Longwokou. The Chinese army found it difficult to advance further and maintained its defensive position south of Diajiapu, with the two sides in close proximity.</p>
<p>Taiyu Front</p>
<p>At this location, Japanese warships on the Yangtze River also approached Tianxingqiao on the evening of the 15th, forcefully landing troops and shelling the shore with naval guns. The Chinese army engaged in a fierce battle with the Japanese army along the Yangtze River outside Taiyu, with both sides charging each other. The Japanese army did not break through the Chinese army's defensive lines. On the morning of the 16th, the fighting continued. The Japanese army, with combined land, sea, and air forces, launched a fierce offensive. The Chinese army also put up a head-on resistance, and the fighting was very intense. On the same day, Japanese troops landed at Madian and linked up with the troops at Kouan. Yangtze River warships concentrated their artillery fire, making it difficult for the Chinese army to maneuver. The Chinese army shifted to the vicinity of ×××. On the morning of the 18th, the Japanese army again advanced north from Madian and was ambushed by the Chinese army at Zhangjiabao. The battle was quite intense. As a result, the Japanese army was unable to succeed and retreated to its original position. As of the 18th, the battle situation on all fronts in Taixian had stabilized. The people of Taixian had voluntarily evacuated in recent days and have now mostly returned. However, Japanese planes continue to operate over Taixian every day, either distributing absurd leaflets or strafing with machine guns, making it difficult for the city to recover. For example, at around 9 AM on the morning of the 15th, three Japanese planes flew over, circling for reconnaissance and distributing large numbers of absurd leaflets. At around 1 PM, three more planes flew over, dropping over a dozen bombs in the vicinity of Dazhuqiao inside the city, killing and wounding about a dozen civilians. Again, at around 10 AM on the morning of the 17th, three Japanese planes invaded Taixian and committed atrocities, dropping four or five bombs near Guangxiaosi, Dalinqiao, the County Chamber of Commerce, and other locations. They then flew to  and dropped four or five bombs there as well. At around 1 PM in the afternoon, three more planes returned, circling for reconnaissance, and then dropped four or five bombs at Gangkouzhen before leaving.</p>
<h3>Wuxi City Gates Open, Market is Extremely Desolate, Rice and Flour Prices Skyrocket</h3>
<p>Wuxi Correspondence: Since the assassination of Magistrate Yang  Tong, the Japanese army has been causing great disturbances, and the city gates have been tightly closed, cutting off transportation, for seven days. On the 15th, the Fanguangfu Gate and the South Gate were opened first, allowing only women and children to enter and exit. The residents of the city gates were in great distress. After people appealed to the Japanese side, they finally agreed to open all the city gates on the 17th. Entry and exit through the city gates are only permitted with a county resident certificate, and only between 8 AM and 8 PM. Hotels, restaurants, eateries, and teahouses are also allowed to reopen. It is still extremely inconvenient for passengers taking the train. Many innocent people have been arrested by the Japanese in recent days and have been subjected to torture. The successor to the puppet government has not yet been determined, and is currently being temporarily managed by the puppet secretary Tang Yong. The market is facing the traditional New Year, and the closure of the city has had a significant impact, resulting in considerable losses. The price of rice was originally limited to 20.5 yuan per shi (unit of dry measure), but recently, due to the scarcity of rice, it has broken the price limit. Baiyang Dazi rice costs 21 yuan, and Ke rice costs 20.5 or 6 yuan. Flour is also expensive, costing 9.5 to 10 yuan per bag. The working class struggles all day and cannot even get enough to eat, so everyone is complaining bitterly. Because Suzhou needs rice for brewing wine, rice is being transported to Suzhou, and the supply is quite strong. Some rice merchants want to find ways to transfer rice to Shanghai, and the current price is 2.35 yuan, but it is difficult to obtain a transport permit, and it is difficult to transport it out for the time being.</p>
<h3>Dinghai Shenjiamen Becomes Smuggling Center</h3>
<p>Dinghai Correspondence: Shenjiamen Town, which belongs to the county, is originally a gathering place for the fishing industry on the Zhoushan Islands. Since its fall, due to the transport of fishing boats between Shenjiamen and the Shanghai "Fish Market," smuggling has become extremely rampant. Various domestic goods subject to tax and sea duties are smuggled from various coastal counties to Shenjiamen, where they are transferred to occupied areas. Japanese-made cigarettes (mostly Sanlu), cigarette paper, cloth , white and yellow sugar, etc., are transported from the occupied areas to Shenjiamen for repackaging and exchange before being smuggled into the mainland by coastal fishing boats, generating huge profits. Therefore, Shenjiamen has now become a center for smuggling.</p>
<h3>Chaoshan Chinese Army Assists Farmers in Transporting Large Quantities of Chao Oranges; Main Force Encircles Japanese Troops in Chaozhou from Three Sides; Orders Farmers to Quickly Pick Oranges and Transport Them to Ports</h3>
<p>Shantou-Chenghai Correspondence: The annual export value of Chao oranges is about 2 million yuan, most of which are concentrated in Shantou for export. This year, orange-producing areas such as  , Jinshi, Longhu, Caitang, and Fuyang have all become war zones, and land and water transportation have been completely blocked. Foreign merchant ships can only dock in Shantou Port for four hours, making it impossible to export Chao oranges. The price of oranges in various villages has thus fallen, with top-quality oranges only fetching 15 yuan per hundred jin (unit of weight). Farmers in Jieyang and Chaoyang are trying to transport oranges to Shenquan in Huilai by shoulder pole and then transfer them to sailboats to Hong Kong. Each boat can carry 5,000 jin and can be sold at a high price in Hong Kong. However, the sea route is very dangerous and is often intercepted by Japanese motorboats. Rarely are all the goods on board safe. Recently, the Chinese army has penetrated deep into the Chaoshan Railway line, protecting the Chao oranges and agricultural products, and transporting them in large quantities back to Jieyang via sea and highway, transporting them to Hong Kong. However, transportation from the producing areas to the coastal areas is done at night. The Chinese army has also recently launched attacks along multiple routes. Those departing from Fengshun Tiandong , passing through Guxiang Baiyun Mountain, are approaching the northern suburbs of Chaozhou. Those departing from Jieyang Anjie Road are advancing in three routes, searching towards Chaoan City. One route attacked Chihu from Fengxi, and a fierce battle ensued overnight in Chihu on the 12th. On the morning of the 13th, the Japanese army retreated to Xiasi. Villages east of Chihu were completely recovered. Currently, there is a stalemate between Xiasi. Another route advanced to Hougou, Xinxiang, and Beixiang, engaging in fierce fighting with newly arrived Japanese troops. Another route occupied Yinhu. Japanese troops in Yinhu retreated along Huhui Road back to Chaoan. The Chinese army encircled Chaozhou City from three sides. An immediate order was issued to farmers in Jinshi,  Chao, Fuyang, Longhu, and Caitang to quickly pick oranges, harvesting all those that were ripe and transporting them to the Jieyang rear area, where efforts would be made to sell them to Hong Kong in large quantities in order to alleviate the livelihood of farmers.</p>

The authorities of both concessions will take temporary security measures tomorrow. All non-essential roads along Avenue Edward VII and Avenue Foch will remain closed or will be sealed off, and more Chinese and Western detectives and plainclothes personnel will patrol various roads, checking vehicles and pedestrians. The crackdown will be strictly enforced to maintain security within the concessions.</p>
<p>Promoting Honesty and Shame</p>
<p>Urging Compatriots</p>
<p>The Shanghai Honesty and Shame Promotion Committee issued a statement to all Shanghai compatriots on the eve of January 28th: Citizens of Shanghai, you all deeply understand the great significance of this War of Resistance, which is a matter of life and death for the entire nation. At this final stage, we should strengthen our belief in the inevitable victory of the War of Resistance, endure hardship, persevere in our positions, and not be threatened or tempted.

Dear compatriots, forward-moving Shanghai compatriots, let us encourage each other, join hands, and embark on the bright path of self-reliance, cutting through the thorns and black magic of the present to welcome the arrival of glorious victory!</p>
<h3>Political Assassination Case</h3>
<p>The North-China Daily News reported a case of suspected political assassination at the residence of a Mr. Zhou at No. 120, Lane 214, Tongfu Road. The details are as follows: Yesterday (the 25th) just past noon, four Chinese men entered Mr. Zhou's residence. Three of them were carrying handguns. They forbade anyone from making noise and waited for Mr. Zhou to return home. After about an hour, around 1 PM, Mr. Zhou had not yet returned. At that time, a maid managed to climb onto the roof, sneak into a neighbor's house, and telephone the Chengdu Road police station. A Western Chief Detective Ries and Detective Hill, each leading a team of detectives, rushed to the scene from the Chengdu Road police station, surrounding Mr. Zhou's residence and then entering. When Hill and Western Chief Detective Taylor entered a room, Hill saw a gunman raise his gun to question Taylor. He loudly warned Taylor and simultaneously pushed the door to slam the gunman, preventing him from aiming. Before the gunman could fire, his handgun was confiscated. The other three men were also captured on the spot. The three handguns, all loaded, were handed over to the Firearms Department of the Police Headquarters for inspection yesterday afternoon. On September 24th of last year, when Mr. Zhou and Li Ru , director of the Refugee Orphanage, were walking at the intersection of Fuzhou Road and Yunnan Road, they were attacked by an assassin who fired from behind. Mr. Li was shot and died, while Mr. Zhou was unharmed. It is believed that the assassin intended to kill Mr. Zhou but mistakenly shot Mr. Li.</p>
<h3>Puppet Police Make Things Difficult for British Bridge Again</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury reported that at 8:30 AM today (the 26th), a British man was driving his car along Great Western Road when a Chinese apprentice suddenly ran across the road and was slightly injured when hit by the car. The British man stopped the car and helped the apprentice into the car to take him to the hospital. At the time, a relative of the apprentice was present and asked the British man to take him to the hospital as well. The British man did not understand because of the language barrier, so the car did not leave. Some police from the Great Western Road police station arrived after receiving the news, loaded bullets into their rifles, pointed them at the British man, and blocked his advance. The British man sounded the horn, and police officers from the Anansi police station arrived after hearing the horn. The inspector knew that he could not the man and allowed him to leave safely. He then went to the Japanese Gendarmerie Headquarters at No. 13 Great Western Road to file a strong protest. Before the police officers from the police station returned to the scene, an officer from the Great Western Road police station arrived and, realizing that the police were in the wrong, ordered them to withdraw and allowed the British bridge to proceed.</p>
<h3>Merchants and Passengers Stuck in Wenzhou and Ningbo, Local Products Being Rushed to Shanghai; Tight Defense in Mingzhao; Xiaoshan is Indefensible; Deping Wheel is Safe and Will Return to Shanghai Today</h3>
<p>Yesterday, rumors circulated in Shanghai that Zhaoqing had fallen and that Japanese planes had bombed Ningbo. A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency inquired with shipping industry sources and related parties yesterday and learned that reports were received in Shanghai from Ningbo at 12:00 PM and 4:00 PM yesterday stating, "Ningbo is safe, Mingzhao's telegrams and long distance calls are still working". Nothing was said about Japanese planes bombing Mingbo, which is enough to prove the falls of Zhao and the bombing of Ningbo is not true. However, the county seat of Xiaoshan is indefensible and the situation is unclear. As for coastal areas such as Ningbo, Taizhou, and Wenzhou, security is very tight. The inspection of ships, goods, and passengers entering and leaving is particularly strict. Furthermore, a reporter from Datong News Agency recently inquired with Zhejiang Province, and Luko learned that the Japanese troops crossing the river have now retreated to Xiaoshan Jianggan, appearing to retreat to the north bank. The troops that advanced to Qianqingzhen have also withdrawn, appearing to abandon their strongholds. Yiqiao Guqing also has no trace of the Japanese army. The saying about the war near Zhaoqing that Jinua reported, obviously meant the troops that were advancing to Qianqingzhen, and were ambushed by the Chinese army. However, this has already passed, and Zhao currently appears safe, but the public is relatively frightened. The two Changdi Banks has X County, but still have an office.</p>
<p>Deping Wheel Scheduled to Arrive in Shanghai Today</p>
<p>The person in charge of Sino-Italian Shipping Company told the Xin Sheng News Agency that the reason for the Deping Wheel's delay in Ningbo was initially due to the wind and snow outside Zhenhai Port, which hindered the unloading work. Then, because the unloading was not completed, it had to delay its return to Shanghai. The loading and unloading are all contracted by the transportation company, and the loading and unloading is carried out in sequence. It is impossible to speed it up. The company has telegraphed the ship master to load less cargo and depart for Shanghai today (27th), and it is expected to arrive in Shanghai on the morning of the 27th. As early as January 29th (Monday), it will set sail from Shanghai to Ningbo again. All the lies about the Deping Wheel outside are not to be believed.</p>
<p>Wenzhou and Ningbo are Safe</p>
<p>Local Products Rushed for Transport</p>
<p>The Norwegian company Hua Lun Yanghang reported to Shanghai yesterday that the Da Bu Wheel arrived in Zheng yesterday and is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai this morning. Because the road between Binbo and the interior of the country is completely closed due to military relations, and the transportation of goods imported through Binbo is time-consuming, the various merchants in Shanghai, fearing that the situation may change during this wartime, have stopped going to import goods, and have telegraphed to ask to return the goods that have arrived in Zhenhai but have not been unloaded to Shanghai. As for the local products stranded in !Bo, the English ship Mannie Maller, agented by Daxin Bank, arrived in Shanghai from Wenzhou the night before last, and is scheduled to continue sailing to Wenzhou today. A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency interviewed the crew of the ship. According to them, the south side of Wenzhou is as safe as usual, and residents have been evacuated to prevent bombing by Japanese aircraft. As for the foreign ships currently anchored outside Jiang, there are four English merchant ships: Anf, Xinan, Xinan and Yongfeng. There are many local products stranded in Wenzhou, and efforts are being made to transport them to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Exchange Suspended</p>
<p>Telegrams Continue</p>
<p>A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency inquired with the Transportation Section of the Postal Administration and learned that, due to the heavy military transport since the outbreak of the war in the counties of Eastern Zhejiang and along the Zhejiang Railway line, the dispatch of parcels to the above-mentioned areas has been temporarily suspended since yesterday morning. The notice stated that, starting from the 26th of this month, all large parcels to County and those passing through it (including Yongjia) will be temporarily suspended from collection and dispatch. In addition, a delayed telegram issued by the Lishui Administration at 23 locations was received yesterday, stating that, starting today, the collection and dispatch of all remittances to Shaoyu, Zhuji, Fengqiao, Pai Tou, Xiaoshan, Anchang, Ma An, Dongkai, Linpu, Guanjia, Keqiao, Yiqiao, Xiafangqiao, Sunrui, etc., has been temporarily suspended. As for light postal items, they will still be delivered as usual. According to the news from the Great Northern, Great Eastern, and Pacific Telegraph Companies, the water line telegrams from Shanghai to Shaoyang and Xiaoshan are still receiving signals as usual. Whether they can reach their destination from Hong Kong cannot be predicted.</p>
<h3>British Ship Blocked by Japanese Warships off Fuzhou; Detained for Eleven Hours; Inspection but No Signature</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury reported that Yongsheng Wheel of Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., which sails along the Chinese coast, arrived in Shanghai this morning (26th) with several passengers. The ship was intercepted by the Japanese Navy for eleven hours outside Fuzhou this Wednesday. Because the British ship did not send a radio report, and the British Navy authorities did not publish the ship's movements, the news of Yongsheng being intercepted was not previously known. The incident went as follows: Yongsheng Wheel was sailing outside Fuzhou this Wednesday, and a Japanese destroyer approached and launched two empty cannons. Yongsheng immediately stopped to wait for the Japanese Navy to verify the ship's identity. After a while, a team of Japanese sailors boarded the ship. Their officers asked the Yongsheng Wheel captain if the British Navy had intercepted Maru et al. and interrogated the passengers. After everything was completed, they did not sign the documents proving that the ship had been inspected, but detained the Yongsheng Wheel for eleven hours for no reason before releasing it. This incident is similar to the interception of the British ship Lanpura by the Japanese Navy outside Hong Kong four months ago. Even though Japan has not declared war on China, it has no right to intercept ships of third countries in warring countries, but</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, there have been many reports of Japan intercepting and boarding ships of third countries. In order to avoid unfortunate incidents, the British authorities have ordered British merchant ships to respond to signals from Japanese warships and report the name of the ship. According to Sir Clerk, the British Ambassador to Japan, yesterday (25th) to Japanese journalists, since the start of the Sino-Japanese War in 1937, British merchant ships have been intercepted by the Japanese Navy no less than 191 times.</p>

He is the light of China, the soul of China. He is the light of China, the soul of China, and shines as long as the sun and the moon.</p>
<p>Water Dragon Chant</p>
<p>Liu Gonghe wrote a Water Dragon Chant in memory of Mr. Ma Xiangbo: Decaying like a clean valley, withered pines, a hundred years of sleep, a vicissitude of eyes. The wandering summons is outside, the old people of the Central Plains, the setting sun is sad late. The green carriage rises in the west, the scenery spreads in the east (the two sentences can be found in the Jingjiao monument, which is the beginning of Catholicism entering China). To amend the secluded explanations, the Canghuang North Wish, the rivers and mountains are embroidered, what world is this? Tears are full of traces. The cranes are flying immortals and not returning. Countless winds and clouds have scattered. The family mountain Seven Temples, the stele sinks into the Liang Phase (Youda is the Yelike Wen, which is the Catholic Church, in the Seven Temples of Zhenjiang, see Zhi Shunzhi's Da Yu Guosi Liang Xiang stele record for details). To whom should this emotion be sent? Looking to the edge of Yan, the great call to mourn, the frost sky Qiang flute, is better than a cavity of lone anger. Full of doors and peaches and plums, touching the times and worrying.</p>

<h3>American Ambassador on His Way to Hankou, Japanese Side Deliberately Spreads Alarming Rumors, Claiming the National Government Ordered Guerrillas to Harm Him, American Residents All Find It Absurd and Ridiculous</h3>
<p>The English-language "China Press" reports that the Japanese "New Shanghai News" today (the 26th) published war news stating that Chongqing had instructed special agents and guerrillas in the Yangtze River area to harm American Ambassador Johnson, who is currently en route to Hankou, in order to blame Japan and make US-Japan relations even more difficult.</p>
<p>(American Residents in This City)</p>
<p>Find this claim absurd and ridiculous, as Sino-American relations have always been friendly, and Johnson enjoys a good reputation in Chongqing. American residents also recalled that after Fessenden, Director-General and Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, narrowly escaped an assassination attempt, Japanese newspapers immediately claimed that the assassin was sent by Chongqing. However, the police found that the attacker came from Dastis. The general public believes that the Japanese propaganda about Chongqing plotting such a thing is a kind of</p>
<p>(Preventative Measure)</p>
<p>To prevent the repeal of the US-Japan Commercial Treaty, and to provide an excuse if they attempt anything against Johnson. The American Ambassador arrived in Nanjing at 10:30 AM on Wednesday and continued upstream on the Luzon yesterday morning (the 25th). He will stay briefly in Wuhu and Jiujiang, and is expected to arrive in Hankou on Monday.</p>
<h3>Salary Increase of French Tram Company Employees</h3>
<p>Yesterday, we received a letter from the Shanghai Second District Water and Electricity Workers' Union, making a statement regarding the salary increase issue of the French Tram Company. The original letter stated, "After reading the report on the salary increase issue of the French Tram Company on page nine of the third section of your newspaper on the 26th, we found that many of the facts stated were inconsistent with reality. Our union members, due to the high cost of living, rice, firewood, and fuel being expensive, gathered to discuss demanding a temporary increase in</p>
<p>Year-End Bonus</p>
<p>Of one month's salary, with a uniform 20% increase in wages, from the French Water and Electricity Company. Our union sent a letter to the French Water and Electricity Company on December 21st of last year. Our union then held two negotiations with Mr. Fa, the manager of the company, on December 26th and 27th. However, the manager of the company stated that the accounts for 1939 had already been reported to the board of directors, and it would be difficult to approve the request for a one-month increase in the year-end bonus for all workers. Until January 24th, workers from various departments, as the</p>
<p>Final Conclusion</p>
<p>Date was approaching, hoped that the salary increase issue would be resolved as soon as possible. Therefore, they sent nine representatives to request from the company. As a result, labor and management negotiated a solution. However, due to the long time, the workers working in the factory hoped that the representatives would return to the factory to report, and the work was slightly suspended. However, more than seventy workers at the Dongjiadu Water Plant followed the union's instructions and continued to work as usual, and the workers in the Lujiiawan engine room continued to work as usual, and there was no strike. On the afternoon of the same day, our union again</p>
<p>Sent Representatives</p>
<p>To request from the company. The manager of the company contacted the results and decided to solve it on the 26th. All workers were satisfied and returned to work as usual at 2:50 PM. In the multiple contacts, our union representatives directly negotiated with Mr. Fa, the manager. Mr. Tu Jingsheng only served as a translator and had nothing to do with the case. The stabbing of Mr. Tu's younger brother is even more</p>
<p>Irrelevant</p>
<p>We believe that the rumor is untrue and should be corrected. As for the salary increase method, it was resolved at 5:00 PM on the 26th. The method is that each worker will receive a temporary subsidy of 1.5 jiao for rice per day, and the wages of senior workers will increase by 8 fen per day. All workers expressed satisfaction upon hearing the news, and the salary increase method mentioned in your newspaper on the 26th (according to this manuscript, it was translated from the English "China Press") is inconsistent with the facts, and please correct it accordingly."</p>

<p>Since the weather in this city was hit by the high-pressure system in Northwest China, the cold became severe. Yesterday, it was hit by a cold wave again. The temperature from 5:00 to 6:00 AM dropped to 6.1 degrees Celsius below freezing point, only 21 degrees Fahrenheit, which was the first day of severe cold this year. As a result, the sewers, canals, and water storage equipment all froze into thick ice. The coldness of the weather was such that water would freeze into ice. Pedestrians on the street all looked huddled up. Refugees and beggars could not bear the cold and were freezing to death in large numbers. According to a reporter from Datong News Agency, the Pushan Villa found 15 adult corpses and 68 child corpses in the Public Concession the day before yesterday. Yesterday, another 24 adult corpses and 65 child corpses were collected. In two days, the total number reached 182. All of them have been coffined by the hall and transported to the International Cemetery on Hongqiao Road in West Shanghai, and buried in the charity cemetery. As the inland rivers and harbors were also frozen, there were few ships entering and leaving Suzhou Creek yesterday. As the number of people carrying vegetables into the market suddenly decreased, the price of noodles was extremely high. It is said that this cold weather will continue for several days. It is also said that the temperature in Beiping yesterday morning also dropped to minus ten degrees, which was extremely cold.</p>
<p>Tzu-yu Association Distributes Winter Clothing to Children</p>
<p>The Shanghai Office of the China Tzu-yu Association, in view of the fact that the north wind has been blowing fiercely in recent days and the weather has been extremely cold, the general poor children have no clothes to cover their bodies, which is very miserable, especially the children in shantytowns and on the streets, who are the most painful. Therefore, they have specially processed and rushed to make the second batch of 4,000 sets of winter clothing to meet the urgent need. The association has sent people to various poor areas to investigate and distribute winter clothing coupons. It is now scheduled to distribute the winter clothing in three districts. The first day is the North District, which is scheduled to be distributed today at the Shanghai Fellow Association of Seven Counties in Shaoxing on Averent Road. The second day is the West District, which is scheduled to be distributed on the 28th at the West District Branch of the Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Association at 288 McGon Road. The third day is the South District, which is scheduled to be distributed on the 29th at the Tzu-yu Education Institute, which is run by the association at 1231 Rue Lafayette. All children with winter clothing coupons can go to the designated date and place to receive winter clothing. Please do not delay, and pay attention to the following three points: (1) Each coupon is limited to one child, who must receive it in person; (2) Infants or young children should be taken by family members to receive it; (3) This coupon will be invalid if it expires.</p>
<p>Charity Federation Was Unable to Finish in Time</p>
<p>Recently, the weather in this city has been severely cold, and there are many frozen corpses on the road. The situation of the poor who are suffering from the cold is particularly pitiful. The Shanghai Charity Federation, in view of this, has specially rushed to make a large number of cotton clothes and distributed them to the poor in the open space of the association at 35 Yunnan Road to protect against the winter cold. In recent days, many people have heard the news and went to receive them. The association has distributed a total of more than 2,600 sets of cotton clothes in four times. The beneficiaries are all smiling. It is now heard that the association is unable to finish making the cotton clothes and is having difficulty coping. In addition to separately handing them over to the refugee shelter groups for tailoring, the distribution has been temporarily suspended. In addition, the number of people waiting for relief rice buns and ginger soup at Dagu Road every night has been increasing day by day. Last night (the 26th), it has increased sharply to more than 4,500 people, and 45 bags of flour were distributed. In terms of order, due to the large number of people, in addition to being taken care of by Mr. Lu and Mr. Cheng Tongsheng of the association, the association and the Chengdu Road Police Station have also sent additional personnel to maintain it, so it is quite good. The number of people receiving white rice distributed by the Shanghai Municipal Council at Moore Hall also increased sharply yesterday.</p>
<h3>Foreign Rice Arrives One After Another, Market Price Rises Instead, Breaking the 40 Yuan Mark, Authorities in Both Concessions Have Been Closely Monitoring</h3>
<p>Foreign rice has arrived one after another, reported by the newspapers, but the price of rice remains firm, and because it is not restricted, the market opened yesterday and broke the 40 yuan mark, exceeding the price limit for japonica rice, which has a significant impact on the livelihoods of the common people. It is said that the authorities have paid attention to it. Yesterday, Jardine Matheson's Yong Sheng Wheel arrived, carrying 1,293 bags from Hong Kong, and another 14,163 bags are scheduled to be transported to Tianjin by the same ship. It is said that a large number of bags will arrive in the coming days.

<h3>Salvation Army Mobile Soup Kitchen, Chinese and Foreign Enthusiastic Support, 800 Poor People Filled Their Stomachs Every Night, Donations From All Parties Have Reached Around 20,000</h3>
<p>According to the China Press, Major Morris of the Salvation Army told reporters yesterday (the 25th) that the pitiful situation of the starving and freezing poor people rushing to beg for rice when the Salvation Army's mobile soup kitchen distributed hot rice on Wednesday night. According to reports, about 800 people were able to fill their stomachs with the Salvation Army's soup kitchen. When the project is actively promoted, it is hoped that the soup kitchen will reach 5,000 people every night. However, when the mobile soup kitchen arrives, there are always poor people</p>
<p>Who Have Already Died of Starvation</p>
<p>And it is too late to save them. People from all walks of life have enthusiastically supported the Salvation Army's soup kitchen movement and donated generously. The total amount of donations has reached 6,071 yuan, 8 jiao, and some fen, and 10 pounds in British currency. For example, a British child who is only six years old was deeply moved by the news that poor people had died on the streets. The next morning, he</p>
<p>Immediately Accompanied By His Mother</p>
<p>Visited Major Morris and donated many clothes and shoes. Some Chinese servants in a foreign residence also jointly donated 41 yuan. Although the amount is not large, their intentions are extremely appreciated. For example, a well-known Chinese person in this city donated a check for 10,000 yuan, and the Shanghai Municipal Council donated 1,000 yuan, etc. In short, people from all walks of life have generously donated, in varying amounts, which proves that</p>
<p>People in This City</p>
<p>Deeply pity the helpless poor people on the streets. Major Morris said that the soup kitchen truck will depart at 7:00 PM every night and travel through the central area with the most beggars and stop in the alleys. People will distribute meal tickets at the front of the truck. Beggars can receive rice with the ticket. The Salvation Army's soup kitchen truck will work in different districts in this city. Each district will have personnel in charge of the work.</p>

<h3>A Review of Shanghai's Industry in 1939 (1) – The Shanghai Municipal Council Annual Report – Part 3</h3>
<p>During the first six months of last year, the industrial sector of this city continued the recovery trend of the previous year. Many large and medium-sized factories, which started construction in the previous year in the Western Shanghai and extra-settlement road areas, commenced operations last year. In addition, some emerging industries, previously unseen in the concessions, began preparations at the beginning of last year, with promising preliminary plans.</p>
<p>In June of last year, the exchange rate tightened, and in July, it fell again, with a far-reaching impact. Some projects were abandoned as a result, and factories with new buildings nearing completion were forced to temporarily suspend idle work. The prices of many industrial raw materials rose sharply; partly due to the devaluation of the exchange rate, and partly because some people used their savings to purchase goods for speculation, resulting in a situation where raw materials were more profitable than manufactured goods. Before market demand returned to normal and retail prices were adjusted, the output of various factories was reduced.</p>
<p>As the European war broke out, the source of raw materials became more difficult. Some speculators anticipated a shortage of various raw materials, so they became active in the market again, making it difficult for manufacturers to purchase for legitimate business. As a result, in December, the Straits Settlements government adopted war measures, announcing the prohibition or restriction of entry of many goods, which dealt another severe blow to the industrial sector of this city.</p>
<p>The industrial sector of this city lost its usual market in the Yangtze River basin due to the war, the difficulty and restriction of transporting goods to un-occupied areas, the adoption of business control policies in other places, and the lack of purchasing power of the people. As a result, Chinese and foreign manufacturers have successively turned to foreign countries to develop, and have gained new markets in India, South Africa, and other places. Unfortunately, after the outbreak of the European war, various countries announced restrictive policies one after another, so that some of the new markets that have been obtained have been blocked, and the uncertainty of shipping has made the general manufacturers more difficult.</p>
<p>(Overview of Various Industries) Cotton Mills: The cotton mill business in the Western Shanghai and extra-settlement road areas developed greatly last year. Many new factories have started operation. As of the end of the year, there were 46 large cotton mills in the above two districts. Except for three, the rest have not seen any slackening in work. However, some small cotton mills have reduced work due to the impact of foreign exchange contraction.</p>
<p>Chemical Plants: There is a noteworthy new development in the manufacturing of industrial chemical plants. Two new plants manufacturing hydrochloric acid and sodium sulfate are under construction. One of them is about to start operation. Two more are in the planning stage. Two new plants manufacturing alcohol are preparing to start operation, one of which intends to use grains as raw materials. Four new plants manufacturing red lead (one of which also manufactures lead acetate and zinc sulfate) have all started operation.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Revises the Method for Collecting and Exchanging Damaged Banknotes, Those Who Deliberately Damage Them May Not Be Collected or Exchanged, Ordered the Four Banks of China, Central, Communications, and Farmers to Comply</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance has revised the method for collecting and exchanging damaged banknotes and has ordered the four banks of China, Central, Communications, and Farmers to comply.

The damage is minimal, and the remaining part is</p>
<p>Three Quarters</p>
<p>Or more; B. Although they have been split, all pieces can be matched; C. They are stained or scorched, but the signatures, numbers, words, patterns, etc. are all identifiable; (2) Damaged banknotes with the remaining part less than three quarters shall be collected and exchanged at half value; (3) Damaged banknotes that fall under one of the following circumstances shall not be collected or exchanged: A. They have been scorched by fire, soaked in water, stained with oil, or smeared, and it is impossible to identify their authenticity; B. The remaining part is less than</p>
<p>One Half</p>
<p>; C. They are pieced together; D. They have been deliberately cut, excavated, smeared, or the face has been damaged; E. Banknotes that cannot be circulated, such as sample coupons and scrapped coupons; (4) Damaged banknotes, although the damage situation meets the requirements of the first and second articles, but if there is suspicion of deliberate damage, they may not be collected or exchanged; (5) Damaged banknotes, if there are special circumstances, causing the remaining part to be inconsistent with the provisions of the first and second articles of this method, and the person requesting the exchange can</p>
<p>Prove The Facts</p>
<p>And the responsible personnel of the four banks believe that it can be accommodated, the exchange may be made at discretion, but the damaged banknote must be signed and certified by the responsible personnel of the four banks.</p>
<h3>Bank Accountant Embezzles Negotiable Instruments, totaling $950, Sentenced to Four Months in Prison</h3>
<p>Liu Zhenhan, from Wuxi, served as an accountant at the Shilu branch of the Zuohui China Bank. On the 11th of last month, a customer, Mr. Jia, went to the branch to discount a $950 remittance instrument. Liu paid the money but did not enter it into the account and embezzled the remittance instrument. It was not until the day before yesterday that the bank discovered it and reported it to the Chief Inspectorate of the Public Concession Police Department, which arrested Liu. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the First Criminal Court of the Special District. The China Bank hired lawyer Yuan Yang'an to bring a civil suit, and the Police Department lawyer Ru Baochun prosecuted him for embezzlement. He also stated that Liu had committed the same incident twice before and had a letter of repentance, etc. When questioned, Liu confessed. Judge Xiao verified the confession and sentenced Liu to four months in prison in court and ordered him to repay the China Bank $950.</p>
<h3>Failed to Recover Debt, Conspired to Kidnap and Extort, Victim Xiao Guitang Redeemed for 5,000 Yuan, Mastermind Xu Renlong and Others Arrested</h3>
<p>Xiao Guitang, who lives at 259 Park Road, previously owed 300 yuan to the aunt of Xu Renlong from Pudong, which has not been repaid. Xu then lured Xiao to Pudong on the 6th of this month and then sent others to kidnap Xiao and extort 20,000 yuan. After repeated negotiations, they settled on 5,000 yuan, and Xiao was released on the 17th. The Chinese Detective Ding Huaguo, Detective Yang Fusheng, and Xu Shutian of the Xinzha Police Station arrested Xu Renlong in Guangdong Road. Xu confessed that he had also arrested Shanghai woman Xu Zhou (also known as Zhou Xinhong) in room 28 of the Yongle Hotel on Fujian Road, and arrested Bu Rentian and Li Dayou from Taizhou at Xinzhaqiao Road. It was found that Xu had received 400 yuan in legal tender after the incident, Zhou Xinhong received 350 yuan, and Zhou was the representative for Xiao's family to contact the bandits. Yesterday morning, all the people were escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the Special District. Police Department lawyer Zhang Tianyin explained the process and requested that the hearing be postponed because the case still needs to be investigated in detail. After Judge Xiao Peishen questioned each defendant, he ordered them to be remanded in custody and postponed the hearing.</p>
<h3>Children Playing With Fire, Tragically Burned to Death</h3>
<p>Guan Hanzhong, a Cantonese, 30 years old, lived in the back room on the third floor of 9 Beiyuan Lane, Dongzilaihuo Street. Every day, he was a vendor in the Ba Xian Qiao Franco-Chinese School, selling stationery and candies. At 11 AM yesterday, Guan's six-year-old son, Wei Xing, was playing with fire in the room alone. He did not realize that it would be set ablaze. Guan's wife was out buying groceries and had not returned. The child could not escape and was buried in the fire. The fire was extinguished after the fire brigade arrived to put out the fire. The child's body was pulled out and sent to the Tongren Fu Yuan Branch morgue to await a report to the court for inspection.</p>
<h3>Cap-Snatching Gang, Leader and Followers Arrested Together, Pawnshop Accomplices Also Detained</h3>
<p>Whenever the weather is cold and the year is coming to an end, cap-snatching gangs (commonly known as "throwing top palace") take the opportunity to rise and act one after another. The French Police Department, because it is very important to the peace of the citizens, has previously ordered the arrest of as many as 60 members of the gang in the concession. Unexpectedly, if the organization</p>
<p>(Is extremely large) There is also a person in charge behind the scenes, and even the general small pawnshops know to seek profit and also have trade relations with the organization. On December 13th of last year, Detectives Cohen and Cohenqi of the French Police Department continued to capture six cap-snatching criminals in the Caishi Road area: Wang Shourong, Lv Xikuan, Zhou Xipeng, Mei Guangfa, Huang Shouqiang, and Liu Qingshan. After</p>
<p>(Confessing the Gang Leader) Was Zhao Yuelong from Jiangbei, they arrested Zhao again and found dozens of felt hats and more than 40 pawn tickets. According to his confession, after the gang obtained various felt hats, they had no way to sell them, so they entrusted Qu to pawn them at 172 Rue Labourdonnais. After obtaining the money, they gave the robbers 60% and the remaining 40% as Qu's reward. The pawnshop also used this kind of transaction to</p>
<p>(Raise the Pawning Price) Often exceeding 20% or more, so that after pawning the hats, the gang deliberately abandoned the pawn tickets, and those who picked them up could go to redeem them, and the pawnshop could also make a profit. Yesterday, Judge Zhang Minsheng of the Second Special District Court took the bench in the First Criminal Court and ordered the defendants to be brought in for trial. The clerk of the pawnshop, Lu Qikai, was also summoned to the court. After reviewing the evidence, the judge announced the end of the debate and scheduled the verdict to be announced on February 2nd. The defendant Zhao Yuelong and others were remanded in custody, and Lu Qikai was also detained.</p>
<h3>Retired Detective Commits Fraud to Obtain Money, Arrested in a Brothel, Frauds 7,000 Yuan in Movement Expenses, Confesses to the Charges</h3>
<p>The reception office of the Tongcheng Silk Mill at 406 Jiangxi Road recently had raw silk worth about 20,000 yuan detained in Nantao and could not be transported out. While they were planning a proper solution, a retired Chinese detective, Sun Renjie (also known as Sun Wenxiang), went to contact Xie Di'an, the associate manager of the office, and said that he had a way to transport the raw silk to Shanghai, but he had to pay a considerable amount of movement expenses. After negotiating, the movement expenses totaled 7,000 yuan, which Xie paid in full, and Sun personally issued a receipt. This happened on the 23rd of last month. After Sun took the money, he disappeared and avoided meeting. The Tongcheng Silk Mill realized that they had been cheated and reported it to the General Inspectorate, requesting an investigation. As of 11 PM the day before yesterday, Chinese Detective Qian Xianting arrested Sun in the Xin Xin brothel in the Huileli district. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Fourth Criminal Court of the First Special District. Police Department lawyer Zhang Shizhu prosecuted him for fraud and requested that the hearing be postponed because he needed to investigate whether Sun had committed other crimes. When questioned, Sun Renjie confessed to the charges. Judge Zhong Qing verified the confession and ordered him to be remanded in custody and postponed the hearing.</p>
<h3>Qiuyuan Casino Illegally Detains Rickshaw Pullers, Resentment for Not Sending Gamblers, Released After Negotiation by the Rickshaw Company</h3>
<p>According to the China Press, in order to attract customers, the Shanghai West gambling den pays for the car fare and tips for gamblers who travel by rickshaw, and also gives a tip of as much as 1.5 yuan to the rickshaw drivers in order to win them over. However, the drivers of the Yinse, Tailai, Yunfei, and Xingxiangsheng rickshaw companies in this city only give a tip of 0.2 yuan in addition to the car fare. The drivers of the four rickshaw companies decided not to send gamblers to the Qiuyuan Casino. The operators of the casino believed that the drivers' actions had a great impact on the business of Qiuyuan. Last night, they sent a number of armed Chinese and Japanese people to rent rickshaws from the four companies in various parts of the two concessions, forcing the drivers to drive to the Qiuyuan Casino with guns. No fewer than 14 cars arrived one after another, and then the drivers were imprisoned in the casino as punishment. The rickshaw companies were very worried because the cars had not returned to the station for a long time. They then learned the location of the drivers and sent representatives to negotiate with Qiuyuan. It was not until 10:30 PM that all the detained cars and drivers were retrieved.</p>

<p>At about 7:30 PM yesterday, 10 bandits armed with box cannons suddenly broke into a woolen cloth shop at 6 Lane 26, Shanxi Road. At that time, the shop assistants had already left work, and only one or two employees were left inside to settle accounts and sort out the goods. By the time they discovered the bandits entering the house, it was impossible to avoid them, and they were all watched and searched. However, there was no money in the cash box, and the bandits were disappointed, so they turned their attention to the woolen cloth. At that time, six or seven bandits rushed out of the door, hired several rickshaws, moved dozens of bolts of woolen cloth onto the cars, and sped out of the lane, whereabouts unknown. The lookouts waited until the robbers and their accomplices were far away before retreating and fleeing in different directions. After the shop owner checked, he estimated that all the lost woolen cloth was worth more than 20,000 yuan. He immediately detailed the non-single and reported it to the police station, requesting a search.</p>

<h3>Extortion Case Against Silk Merchant: Defendant Firmly Denies Charges, Court Discussion Leads to Adjournment for Sentencing Next Wednesday</h3>
<p>Ye Yonghui, a wealthy silk merchant from Shaoxing, living at No. 5, Lane 303, Qipu Road, suddenly received three threatening letters from gangsters between the 3rd and 10th of this month.

<p>Education News</p>
<h3>National Language Education Association Actively Promotes National Phonetic Alphabet, Planning to Open 1,500 Classes in Shanghai, Hong Kong, Macau, and Other Places</h3>
<p>Hong Kong Communication: The National Phonetic Alphabet is a rational phonetic writing system formulated by the government to assist Chinese characters. Since its promulgation, it has been actively promoted by Li Jinxi, Lu Yiyan, Zhao Yuanren, Huan Lixing, Ma Guoying, and others from the National Language Association. It has been applied in various provinces and cities in the country, and hundreds of thousands of people have been educated. It is expected that within a few years, illiteracy can be reduced by more than half. The Central Ministry of Education recently decided to order the National Language Education Association to hold 1,500 National Phonetic Alphabet training classes for people in Hong Kong, Macau, and other places, so that people in Hong Kong and Macau can use the National Phonetic Alphabet to write and compose essays in a few months. The classes will be held in various schools. The first batch of schools to be contacted for opening classes includes the Confucian Academy and the Zheng Hua Middle School, among dozens of others. A class will be opened as soon as 30 people are enrolled. Major companies, businesses, and factories can write to request that personnel be sent to teach, free of charge. The teachers have passed the national examination and are registered with the Hong Kong government. Westerners in Hong Kong who wish to learn the pronunciation for the convenience of communication between Chinese and Western cultures and commercial contacts between Chinese and foreign workers may also participate. The lectures are annotated with the International Phonetic Alphabet, making learning extremely easy. (Hong Kong registration office: National Language Association, 410 Hennessy Road.) Under the planning of experts, this movement will be carried out jointly in more than a dozen provinces and cities, aiming to introduce the national phonetic alphabet to overseas Chinese communities so that illiterate people can acquire tools for learning and education can be greatly developed.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education to Revise Special Teacher Course Subjects and Hours</h3>
<p>Chongqing Communication: The Ministry of Education has hired experts to revise the weekly teaching subjects and hours for special normal courses and simplified normal courses in order to meet the needs of the War of Resistance and national construction. The regulations for special normal courses and simplified normal courses are also being drafted.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Government Promulgates New School Building Regulations, Schools Request Postponement of Implementation</h3>
<p>Hong Kong Communication: In order to improve school hygiene and protect the health of students, the Hong Kong authorities have promulgated the new school building regulations, which were passed by the Legislative Council half a year ago, to all schools, ordering them to be implemented immediately. Violators will be dealt with separately. The aforementioned regulations were originally to take effect after New Year's Day, but because most schools were on winter vacation, the authorities, in line with the principle of strict legislation but lenient enforcement, postponed it until now. The authorities have only been sending personnel to urge the schools to comply as soon as possible, but have not yet strictly enforced them. Approximately when the winter vacation ends and the new semester begins after the Chinese New Year, these regulations must be implemented. Time flies, and the deadline is approaching. The Hong Kong and Kowloon Education Federation is currently petitioning the authorities to improve the new regulations to avoid affecting general primary and secondary schools. More than 300 primary and secondary schools will jointly sign and seal a petition to the Hong Kong government, requesting that school buildings be gradually improved.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Approves Sichuan and Hubei Provinces to Modify Enrollment for Simplified Normal Courses</h3>

<h3>A Controversy in the Western Youth Basketball Game: Hua Wen Leaves the Court and Refuses to Continue the Game, Hua Lian Entire Team Leaves, Military Officers Declared Victorious</h3>
<p>In last night's Western Youth Basketball Group A game between Hua Lian and Military Officers, Borat and Zhang Wen, the sports directors of the association, served as referees. After the game, Hua Lian scored three consecutive baskets, leading 6-0. The military officers caught up to 11-11 and then surpassed them 13-12. After that, the scores fluctuated unpredictably. At halftime, Hua Lian trailed 23-28 by five points. After the switch, Hua Lian scored one throw and three penalties, forcing a tie at 28-28. From this point, a seesaw battle formed, with neither side giving way. At a tie of 39-39, with nine minutes remaining, Hua Lian player Shen Yu Gong suddenly collided with referee Borat. Borat believed that Shen deliberately fouled and ordered Shen to leave the court. Shen said it was unintentional and refused the decision. The two sides were deadlocked. The Hua Lian players immediately left the court in protest and refused to continue the game. The referee then announced that Hua Lian had forfeited and the military officers were victorious, resulting in an unhappy ending. Before that, there was a game between Mai Hong and Little Bear. In the first half, Little Bear took the lead 15-14. As a result, Mai Hong reversed the defeat with 25-19 to win. With Little Bear defeated and Hua Lian also declared to have forfeited, it seems that Mai Bai can now be compared to the Western Youth. Today there are three Group B games, with the following order:</p>
<p>Skull Uniform - Shanghai Light (B) 3:15 PM</p>
<p>Light and Solid - Giant (B) 4:00 PM</p>
<p>South Man - Aurora (B) 5:00 PM</p>
<h3>Today, Qinghua Battles the Italian Navy to Seize a Spot in the Zilin Cup Replay</h3>
<p>Seventeen teams from China and the West participated in this year's Zilin Cup football tournament. Youyou, Mai Kai, and Measurement have already secured spots in the replay.

Now, the Italian Navy will meet Qinghua again at 2:30 PM this afternoon at Jiaozhou Park for the final battle of the third week. The Italian Navy was able to defeat the defending champion, the French Army, twice, so its strength is considerable. However, Qinghua has been conserving its energy and has a goal of winning the cup, so it will not give up easily. It is expected that the competition between the two sides will be intense. On the same day, there are six league games.

<h3>Once the Paper Tiger is Pierced, Grain Manipulation is Complete, Blatantly Violating Prohibitions, Reed-Tip Rice Etc. Are Sold at High "Keng" Prices, Although Foreign Rice Arrives From Saigon, Prices Have Reached Forty Yuan, People's Food is Completely Controlled, Truly Causing Subjects to Starve to Death. Hoarding is Rampant.</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a considerable amount of early and late rice and other goods, originating from the interior and transferred from the Hongkou district to the South Bund, reached no less than one or two thousand bags. Hoarders have been actively engaged in large-scale activities for days. Unscrupulous merchants treat prohibitions like mere baubles, continuing to act as they please, openly raising and subtly increasing prices. Although the nominal "medium and inferior" grades are still listed with a price limit of forty yuan, actual transactions are scarce, effectively making it a "mere price tag." After Saigon rice soared to forty yuan the day before yesterday, yesterday, even reed-tip foreign rice dared to follow suit, breaking the limit and rising directly to forty yuan. This is truly a great absurdity under heaven. Local people turn a deaf ear and turn a blind eye, passively watching as common people are on the verge of "subjects starving to death." Although the "paper tiger" is fierce, once pierced, it emboldens unscrupulous merchants and even leads to "a donkey wearing a tiger skin," providing an excuse for rising grain prices. Seeing this situation, the general public all become involved in manipulating rice and flour, leading people to mistakenly believe what the manipulators claim is true. Everyone panics, which is truly lamentable. This is all due to the malfeasance of rice merchants and the failure to effectively plan for the food supply of the entire city of Shanghai. It is a lamentable state of affairs. If this continues, there will inevitably come a day when Shanghai has to resort to bran to stave off hunger. Yesterday, the market saw only a smattering of early and late rice transactions, with only four or five hundred bags of goods from Lilizhen and Shengzezhen being traded at a price of forty yuan. The Qing Si brand, which is particularly thin, was similarly priced. The reed-tip foreign rice market was chaotic, with prices soaring to forty yuan. Rice merchants, fearing that they would attract attention and be interfered with, kept it secret and did not disclose it publicly. Baiyuan rice, a seasonal necessity, was being purchased by cake shops and food vendors in haste, and the market saw a considerable price decrease. The price has increased by about half a cent, but unfortunately, there is a shortage of high-quality goods on the market, and most of the transactions are for mid-grade goods. Apart from the Baiyuan rice from Jinyang, which is priced at forty yuan, Baiyuan rice from Danyang is thirty-nine yuan, and even the cheaper grades require around thirty-eight yuan.</p>
<p>Saigon Rice Actually Reaches Forty Yuan</p>
<p>Since Saigon No. 1 rice soared to forty yuan per "shi" (unit of volume) the day before yesterday, merchants yesterday have been hoarding and speculating even more vigorously. Various parties are clamoring for purchases, shouting high prices, manipulating supply and demand, and driving the market higher and higher. Adding to this, reed-tip foreign rice has also broken the limit and soared, even reaching the same price as the high-quality "Keng" rice. Foreign rice is like "a tiger growing wings," and hoarders are as greedy as "wolves devouring sheep." By noon, the market became even more chaotic. Saigon No. 1 initially opened at forty yuan, but closed at forty yuan and seven cents, or forty yuan and five cents. Saigon No. 2 also required forty yuan to thirty-nine yuan and seven or eight cents. Fire-milled rice was initially priced at thirty-nine yuan, but then rose to thirty-nine yuan and five or six cents. Tokyo sharp-tip large-grain rice was sold at thirty-seven yuan for the best quality and thirty-six yuan and a half for the next grade. Rice bran was thirty-six yuan, and broken rice was thirty-one or two yuan, all of which were seven or eight cents to one yuan higher than the previous market. It is estimated that a total of sixteen or seventeen thousand bags were traded throughout the day.</p>
<p>The Price of Foreign Rice Remains Stable</p>
<p>The price of foreign rice remains stable, despite the fluctuations in the price of domestic rice. However, the top-grade rice, such as Saigon No. 1, is still difficult to procure. Fortunately, there is still a large supply of spot goods on the market, so it is not too difficult to obtain. Yesterday, brokers continued to trade 1,200 tons of No. 2 rice to Jianyuan and other companies at a price of 48 yuan and 7 cents, plus five cents, making it 48 yuan and 7.5 cents. In addition, 3,500 tons of small milled rice were newly traded at a price of 47 yuan and a half. The price of broken rice has not been settled, and returned goods have not been opened for sale as they are holding out for higher prices. Recently, foreign rice has once again triggered hoarding activities, and sellers are also holding out for higher prices, refusing to sell.</p>
<p>Large Quantities of Foreign Rice Arrive in Shanghai</p>
<p>Foreign rice continues to arrive in Shanghai, but the price of rice does not decrease, which has a significant impact on the livelihoods of ordinary people. This is because powerful individuals are manipulating the market. Yesterday, the Yih Ho Foreign Firm's ship "Yongsheng" arrived from Hong Kong with 2,293 bags, which were unloaded at the Roosevelt Warehouse. Another 14,163 bags were transported to Tianjin on the same ship. It is also reported that the Italian ship "Sumatra" (transliteration) is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow (the 28th). This ship is carrying more than 20,000 bags of foreign rice from Saigon. After import, it is scheduled to dock at the Huashun Wharf in Hongkou for unloading. (Zu)</p>
<p>Flour Price Increases are Underway</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market trend was still tense, and flour prices were exceptionally high. Although the factories on this street are maintaining the original price of ten yuan, the supply is very limited. This ten yuan flour price and the forty yuan rice price are both deceptive price tags for the masses. Due to insufficient current sales of flour, there were several disputes yesterday and the day before yesterday. Yesterday, Yuan Longchang and others requested the factories to increase prices and sell as much as possible. Although the factories were tempted, they feared that large-scale sales would lead to profits flowing out, so they continued to use the excuse of high costs and limited price increases, claiming that they would still suffer significant losses. They have not yet agreed to approve the price increase. However, according to factory sources, the two parties are currently negotiating, and the price may be slightly increased next week, and the shops will also have a uniform sales price. Customer orders have not been opened for a long time. Except for a small number of customers who urgently need flour and slightly purchase returned goods, there are rarely large transactions. Therefore, the market is quite quiet. However, the price of returned flour is being strongly supported and hoarded by general hoarders due to the limited supply from the factories, causing the price of warehouse receipts to be several cents to one cent higher than the previous two days. It is estimated that "Bing Chuan" brand is eleven yuan and five and a half cents, "Green Cannon" brand is eleven yuan and eight cents, and "Old Cart" brand is still eleven yuan and two and a half cents. This is because the goods supplied by the factories to this street are mostly "Old Cart" brand, so the market price is lower than other brands. The total customer transactions in the market amounted to more than 10,000 bags. The future of flour prices is consistently high, and the problem of livelihood is particularly difficult. It is heard that a certain association is planning to discuss ways to suppress the rising prices of flour and wheat, but empty talk cannot compensate for the facts, and repeated violations of prohibitions are also beyond control. This is why unscrupulous merchants dare to form a "grain manipulation network."</p>
<p>Wheat Price is About to Exceed Twenty Yuan</p>
<p>Due to the manipulation of flour, the raw material wheat is also being manipulated, creating a situation where wheat is more expensive than flour. The day before yesterday, the price of wheat actually reached twenty yuan per hundred catties. Yesterday, the market was as firm as ever, because export demand and Japanese factory demand were strong, so everyone was bullish on the market. Given this situation, it is feared that the price will soon exceed the twenty yuan mark. Yesterday, wheat from Jiangsu, Changzhou, and Wuxi was priced at twenty yuan, and wheat from Yangzhou was nineteen yuan and seven or eight cents. Huafeng Factory and Fuxin Factory purchased 1,000 bags and 6 truckloads, respectively. Fufeng Factory is temporarily not accepting purchases, and the market is already in a state of brewing.</p>
<p>Soybeans See New High Price Yesterday</p>
<p>Yesterday, the soybean market situation, under the fierce looting of general hoarders, the market price set a new record again. Dingjiazhou soybeans have reached the 22 yuan mark. According to observations of people in the industry, the overall situation is that it is hopeless within the lunar new year, so their peak-climbing intentions are still enthusiastically advancing. Yesterday, hoarders from Hong Kong and Shantou divided up more than 1,000 bags of Dingjiazhou soybeans, priced from 21 yuan and six cents to 22 yuan. Hoarders on this street purchased five or six truckloads of Nanjing soybeans, priced from 19 yuan and five cents to 20 yuan. Wuhu soybeans were 200 bags at 20 yuan and six cents, and Chongming Sand Yellow soybeans were 400 bags at 21 yuan and the next grade was 18 yuan and seven cents.</p>
<p>Export Volume of Miscellaneous Grains Today</p>
<p>Today (the 27th), 9,000 bags of flour will be exported to Tianjin, and 7,000 bags of flour will be shipped to Xiamen. In addition, there are 1,210 bags of wheat, 685 bags of beans, 6,220 pieces of soybean cake, and 400 pieces of raw oil, which will also be shipped to Xiamen.</p>
<h3>Finance: Quiet Exchange Market</h3>
<p>The foreign exchange market yesterday, HSBC's listing, are still stable. The black market in British currency is still mediocre and colorless, with minimal changes. It was tight first and then loose, so the result was slightly harder than yesterday. As for the process of the day, the morning opening showed a slightly tight state, at 4 shillings 671875 and 7 yuan 75, a decrease of 0.015625 and 0.03125 respectively. Subsequently, Hong Kong telegrams first came to sell off, and then speculators also slightly settled, so the price rebounded to 4 shillings 703125 and 7 yuan 8125. Extending to noon, there was a lack of discussion and trading, and the state was tranquil. The afternoon closing was 4 shillings 6875 and 7 yuan 78125. The afternoon situation was still lackluster. Hong Kong telegrams came to sell slightly again, but the appetite of outsiders was weaker, so the result was a loose closing price of 4 shillings 703125 and 7 yuan 8125, a decrease of 0.015625 and 0.03125 compared to the previous day. The potential of forward goods is comparable to that of spot goods.</p>
<p>Hong Kong is Still Continuously Selling</p>
<p>At the beginning of the morning, the London premium was reduced by 1875 recently and 5 in the distance. New York silver price remained unchanged, London raw gold remained unchanged, and exchange rates for British currency against the U.S., Shanghai, and France were all unchanged. The US dollar against the British pound fell by 5, against Shanghai by 2 points, and against France by 375 points. The central listing of various exchange rates remained the same. The bank's morning opening spot selling price was British currency 4 shillings 671875 and US currency 7 yuan 75, compared to the previous closing, the British pound was tight at 0.015625, and the US dollar was soft at 0.03125. After the opening, trading was stagnant, and the situation was very flat. HSBC's listing was announced as unchanged, and the silver balance tax was announced to be reduced by 125 points. After that, Hong Kong telegrams came slightly to sell off, and at the same time, local floaters also slightly settled, and the market situation turned loose. It is estimated that Hong Kong telegrams sold spot British currency to outsiders such as Yooli at 4 shillings 702125, and February British currency at 4 shillings 65625, and speculators sold February U.S. currency to outsiders at 7 yuan 6875. At this time, the spot price also rose to 7 yuan 8125. After that, the selling trend subsided, and the situation returned to calm. Only outsiders slightly traded with each other. Until noon closing, the bank's spot selling price was British currency 4 shillings 6875 and U.S. currency 7 yuan 78125, compared to the morning opening, the British currency rebounded by 0.015625, and the US currency rebounded by 0.03125.</p>
<p>Foreign Banks Lack Interest in Buying</p>
<p>The market situation in the afternoon was still tranquil, but the market momentum was slightly loose, because Hong Kong telegrams came again to sell spot U.S. currency to outsiders at 7 yuan 8125. After the entry, outsiders had little appetite for the high price, and instead had the intention to supply, so until the evening closing, the bank's spot selling price was British currency 4 shillings 703125 and U.S. currency 7 yuan 8125, and the next month's term British currency was 4 shillings 640625 and U.S. currency 7 yuan 65625. As a result, the current term British currency decreased by 0.015625 compared to the previous day, and the US dollar also increased by 0.03125.</p>
<p>Hong Kong U.S. Currency Slightly Tight</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 26th, the exchange market opened flat this morning. British and Japanese currencies have not changed. Spot U.S. currency is tight at 0.0625, at 24 yuan 6875. The market exchange rate for spot has increased by 1 yuan, to 316 yuan. It was stable at 11:30 a.m., and there were no changes in any exchange rates. At 2:30 p.m., it was still flat and unchanged.</p>
<p>Tianjin British and American Currencies Both Rebounded Loose</p>
<p>Tianjin, 26th, the exchange market opened flat this morning. Spot British currency rebounded loosely by 0.03125, British currency was 4 shillings 34375, and U.S. currency was 7 yuan 21875. The Shanghai currency continued to increase by half a yuan, to 107 yuan, and the "Union Note" black market was 25 cents cheaper, to 98 yuan and 75 cents.</p>
<h3>Tired Gold Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot gold black market situation was increasingly quiet, and the buying and selling response was mediocre. The trend was slightly weak, because the retail bulls were willing to sell off in this stagnant situation. The morning opening was immediately reduced by 2 yuan, to 4,124 yuan, because the gold number was the first to sell off. Later, the exchange market was reported to be loose, and it was even more unsustainable. Moreover, a certain securities group sold off a lot, and it gradually fell to 4,117 yuan.

<h3>Treat People with Utmost Sincerity</h3>
<p>— Huang Jiayin</p>
<p>Whether in doing things, treating people, or handling affairs, you must treat people with utmost sincerity.</p>
<p>Sincerity is the mark of character, a representation of "genuine goods at fair prices, no deception of children or the elderly."</p>
<p>No one believes those who do not trust themselves, so you must treat people with utmost sincerity. Treat people with a sincere and trusting attitude, and people will surely believe you.</p>
<p>Lack of ability and knowledge can sometimes be excused. But lack of sincerity is inexcusable.</p>
<p>Let the world know that you are upright and sincere, that your "goods" are reliable, then your "business" will surely prosper, your "customers" will be endless, and you will have the joy of being too busy to handle everything.</p>
<p>Sincerity cannot be bought with money. A sincere person, like a magnet, will attract people, attract opportunities, and attract work.</p>
<p>Perhaps you failed yesterday, that doesn't matter. The most important thing is today. What attitude will you use to treat people and handle affairs today?</p>
<p>Try using a new tool. Try using a new power—the power of sincerity—to treat people and handle affairs. In this way, the efforts you spend will surely not be in vain. You will not disappoint others, and others will not disappoint you.</p>
<p>Therefore, please treat people with utmost sincerity!</p>

<h3>Casual Talk on Suicide</h3>
<p>— Chen Shichao</p>
<p>Suicide is a major problem currently facing psychologists, sociologists, and physicians. Superficially, the reasons for suicide are nothing more than economic bankruptcy, incurable diseases, career failure, being shamed and humiliated, and disappointment in love. In fact, these are all secondary. To understand the primary reasons, one must delve into the individual's personality. Because seeking "a final resting place" is not a manifestation of moral cowardice, but rather a conflict in psychology and spirit.</p>
<p>In terms of methods of suicide, women mostly use hanging, drowning, and poisoning. Men use more violent methods such as pistols, knives, and swords. However, Japanese men also often use hanging, jumping off cliffs, and drowning. Their most unique method is seppuku (ritual suicide). In Africa, men mostly use firearms, while women prefer poisoning.</p>
<p>Suicide is a complex act, and mental factors must be investigated. When a person reaches old age and their future prospects are bleak, they naturally turn to suicide. Most suicides are committed by people over the age of forty-five. Men are four times more likely to commit suicide than women. This is because women have a stronger sense of family, which forces them to oppose suicide. Furthermore, the mental distress experienced by women due to social, economic, political, and other problems is not as severe as that of men.</p>
<p>In terms of seasons, summer is the time when most suicides occur, and 80% of suicides take place during the daytime.</p>
<p>The main causes of suicide must be traced to the depths of the subconscious. Because when faced with the same kind of misfortune, some people remain calm, while others have no choice but to commit suicide, it shows that the reasons for deciding to commit suicide are subjective.</p>
<p>Unbeknownst to a person's spirit, many contradictory phenomena are occurring. These phenomena are mostly the result of childhood experiences. A child inevitably has various desires, but is often disappointed. Therefore, the child develops a resentment towards those who hinder the realization of their desires, usually their parents, and even a desire for their death.</p>
<p>The repressed death wish and mental resentment and hatred from childhood, when reaching adulthood, can turn into mental distress and confusion, then into self-contradiction and cruelty, ultimately leading to suicide. Federn said in his book "Suicide": "Suicide is clearly the result of a subconscious moral impulse. This impulse compels people to feel that they must punish themselves with death. This is what they wanted to inflict on their parents in their childhood. Therefore, suicide becomes a fair retribution. The saying "Those who do not wish death on others will not commit suicide" is the reason for this.</p>
<p>Any experiences or emotions that have a negative impact on a person's mental health must be treated with psychotherapy to dispel the disharmony in their heart or the contradictions in their spirit.</p>
<h3>Story of a Madman</h3>
<p>— Xia Chu</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the European War, Germany evacuated public institutions in Saarbrücken and other cities, and a hospital for the mentally ill was also evacuated. It is said that originally, among the lunatics in the hospital, three or four claimed to be Hitler, but after the war broke out, these lunatics were self-aware. During the evacuation, only twelve merchants claimed to be Hitler.</p>
<p>When Hitler marched into Vienna, the founder of psychoanalysis, Freud, could not live in peace because he was Jewish and fled to London in a panic. At that time, an American newspaper reported the event with the headline: "The Madhouse Expels the Doctor."</p>

<h3>Renowned German General Moltke</h3>
<p>— Li Shaozhong</p>
<p>In a recent telegram issued by our national leader President Chiang to primary school principals, teachers, and people from all walks of life, he quoted a famous saying from General Moltke. General Moltke said after winning the Franco-Prussian War that the victory should be attributed to the primary school teachers of the country, which was widely circulated and considered to be an accurate assessment. What kind of person was this General Moltke? Readers must be eager to know. —Editor</p>
<p>The German army's elite and combat prowess became world-renowned after the Franco-Prussian War of 1870. Moltke, the commander-in-chief during the Franco-Prussian War, was not only the first famous general in the German army, but also one of the most outstanding staff generals in the history of modern armies.</p>
<p>Moltke was born on October 26, 1800, into a noble German family. His father moved to Holstein in 1805 and became a Danish citizen. Unfortunately, in that same year, his country house suffered from the "raid" disaster, and his house in the town of Lübeck was looted by the French, causing the family to decline. Therefore, the young Moltke grew up in a very poor environment. At the age of eleven, he was sent to an army school in the Danish capital to study. In 1818, he joined the Danish army. But when he was twenty years old, he decided to join the Prussian army. At the age of twenty-three, he entered the advanced war college, and his grades were excellent upon graduation. In 1831, he was transferred to the staff headquarters in Berlin.</p>
<p>Moltke loved to study literature and history, and especially enjoyed traveling. He published a novel "Two Friends" and many papers on international political geography and war. In 1832, he signed a contract with a bookstore to translate Gibbon's "Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire" into German, with a royalty of seventy-five pounds. His original plan was to earn this money to buy a good horse. In eighteen months, he translated nine volumes, with three volumes remaining unfinished. However, the bookstore owner was unable to publish the book, so Moltke only received twenty-five pounds.</p>
<p>In 1835, he received six months of leave and went to travel in Southeast Europe. After a short stay in Constantinople, he remained in the Turkish army with the approval of the Berlin authorities. During this period, he constantly wrote letters to his mother and sister, which he later revised and published. One of his sisters married an Englishman living in Holstein as his second wife. The good husband had a daughter from his previous wife, named Mary Burt, who often read Moltke's letters at her stepmother's house. When Moltke returned from abroad, he proposed to Mary, and it was quickly successful. The wedding was held in 1841. Moltke had two children.</p>
<p>The Franco-Prussian War suddenly broke out in 1870, but Moltke had already begun collecting reports in 1857 to plan for this inevitable war. Because of the success of Moltke's strategy in the Austro-Prussian War of 1886, his position in this war was further strengthened. Five days after the mobilization order for the Prussian and South German armies was issued on July 15, 1870, he was appointed as the Chief of the General Staff of the General Headquarters. On June 16 of the following year, he was ennobled as Field Marshal. He died suddenly on April 24, 1891.</p>
<p>心理 (Psychology)</p>
<h3>What Are You Afraid Of?</h3>
<p>— Luo Daoai</p>
<p>When humans are born, they only have two fears: first, fear of falling; second, fear of loud noises. Later, as they gradually grow up, they become afraid of other things.</p>
<p>Fear can hinder digestion, disrupt the work of the heart, affect physical development, and sometimes cause heart disease. Many scientists believe that high blood pressure is often caused by anxiety and fright.</p>
<p>One psychologist studied fear, and the results showed that children who grow up in wealthy families are more afraid of falling, more afraid of noises, more afraid of diseases, and more afraid of death than children from poor families.</p>
<p>Fear can cause blood vessels to constrict, cause paleness, and cause the heart to beat very rapidly.</p>
<p>When psychologists were studying psychology, they once asked many people what they were afraid of. As a result, more than 15% of people were afraid of animals in their childhood. In addition, what they were afraid of was: accidents, injuries caused by accidents, personal shortcomings or personal failures, being alone in a dark place, and times of pain.</p>
<p>Sometimes children can also develop fear indirectly. For example, a child used to like to play with rabbits. When he was happily playing with the rabbits, a loud noise suddenly startled him. He then got a bad impression, and from then on, whenever he saw rabbits, he would naturally be afraid.</p>
<p>It is not abnormal for children to be afraid of dark places. This is a human instinct, because ancient humans, for fear of enemy attacks, often had all kinds of fears in their hearts whenever it was dark.</p>
<p>The fear of the dentist's chair is probably the most difficult of all human fears to control.</p>

<h3>Seeking Knowledge</h3>
<p>— You Qing</p>
<p>Knowledge is not private property, nor is it an ornament. Those who wear doctoral caps should not be proud, and those who are abandoned outside the school gate should not be sad.</p>
<p>Seeking knowledge is a kind of happiness, but also a hardship. Without diligence and hard work, without seeking to understand, "getting through in a day" or "getting through in a month" will ultimately not succeed.</p>
<p>Knowledge can be acquired anytime, anywhere. Experience is the most valuable knowledge.</p>
<p>Everyone should strive to seek knowledge. If circumstances do not allow them to run into school, they can pursue knowledge in many ways.</p>
<p>The purpose of seeking knowledge should be to serve society. If one seeks knowledge for the sake of getting promoted and making a fortune, then all the knowledge in one's life is false.</p>
<p>Knowledge advances along with the times. One must constantly train oneself and improve oneself in order not to fall behind.</p>
<h3>Tidbits</h3>

<p>The people of Denmark, Sweden, and Norway are the nations that drink the most coffee.</p>
<p>Thirty years ago, if you wanted to get one kilowatt of electricity per hour, you needed to burn three pounds of coal. Modern generators only need one pound of coal to generate the same amount of electricity.</p>
<p>If drivers in Germany violate traffic rules, their names and addresses are registered on pink signs on the streets.</p>
<p>An average pair of stockings has fifty miles of silk thread.</p>
<p>A butterfly's tongue, when curled up, looks like a watch spring.</p>
<p>If you were to encircle the Earth once with the silk spun by a spider, and then wind it into a ball, the ball would weigh about one pound.</p>
