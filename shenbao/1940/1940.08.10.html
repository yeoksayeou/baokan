<p>近日上海外滙市面倏然又見緊俏，推原其故，爲說不一：有謂進口貨結款殷繁者，有謂國際時局波動使然者，有謂改訂商業匯率所致者，有謂投機之徒操縱其間者；凡此云云，殆各佔若干成分於其間歟？夫以貿易與國際等類關係，供需有所張弛，市價爲之低昂，是實外匯常情，無足駭怪。然默察情况，凡在匯價穩定之際，宜為工商百業放手買賣之時，而事實所示，供需反而淸淡，相安幾類相忘；每有外匯步跌之日，甚至裏足不前，是誠反常之象也。獨於漲風再起之候，最見活躍，亦即反常愈甚。蓋有喪心病狂者焉，輒於其時，播爲駭怪不經之說，以冀掀動一般視聽；聞者不察，從而驚疑。惑於外幣市價一時之趨貴，不知其既貴而以爲行且更貴，相率以購藏外幣爲得計。此於法幣之本身，曾何所損，然法幣市値勢必相形爲貶；是以貶之者、以及深受貶之損者，非他人，即以法幣爲生活基礎而略有餘力以購外幣之人也。</p>
<p>要知外國之貨幣，操於外國。其貨幣本身有無問題，是問題一；其國家安危有無問題，是問題二；本身無問題，安危無問題，然其政府所採政策有無問題，是問題三。可憐盲目而善忘者之衆也，不見歐戰爆發及其突然擴展之際乎？歐　諸國相繼牽入漩渦，上海之存款於交戰國商行者，惶惶然不知措手足，愁慮狼狽。又不憶德法驟吿停戰之際乎？上海幣市竟無法郎票與安南票之市價，歷時許久；當時爭謀脫而求售不得手。凡此風波，絕非意外也。盲目者非不見之乎？善忘者非不憶之乎？抑知世變方亟，凡此風波絕非世變之終局，實爲世變之初期：繼此風波，容有性質更劇之風波，容有範圍更廣之風波，容有期間更長久之風波。德義旣得局部勝利，誰知其金融政策不將富有革命性而影響廣泛？英國準備長期作戰，誰知其戰時金融不將作異常嚴格之統制？美國黃金滿盈，爲政治運用計，爲商品發展計，爲消極補苴或積極扶植計，將凍結乎，得不梗滯乎，亦將貶値暢通乎？凡此云云，無從逆覩；殫思竭慮以研求之，推測之，種種可能，雜然並陳，自以爲智慧而爭制機先，仍無殊於呼幺喝雉，黑與白，得與失，半與半焉。故謂購藏外幣而得高枕無憂者，欺人之談，自欺之甚也。</p>
<p>疑雲滿天，荊棘遍地，時勢如斯，歧途當前，我人竊信所論之非甚遠。抑姑就近者言之：有購進者，必有售出者，否則不成市面，何來市價。今之斥法幣以購藏外幣者，自以爲聰明；試問吸收法幣而塞出外幣者。非銀行乎，非洋商乎？豈銀行洋商之盤算不若爾之聰明乎？即此一端，可見法幣在國際通貨之中，自有其實質，自有其地位。有實質，有地位，而爲之主人之中國人，不恤自損，相率盲從而貶之，是誠何心？謂非至愚！自損者似不足惜，顧就大體言之，更有其不可恕之處。何也？中國方在戰爭之中，貨幣乃經濟之國防，經濟戰爭乃全面戰爭中之一面，而貨幣角逐亦即其中之一環；故敵中國者，並敵法幣，以毀法幣爲快；今之不惜法幣而貶價予人，何殊輕授人以國防工具，何殊輕自繳械。是爲中國計之，是可恕乎？或謂取得外幣，非即對外幣之攻勢乎？此詭辯也、蓋必以國貨取外幣，庶幾近矣，若自貶以得之，則得不償失，此顯明之事理也。</p>

<h3 id="c62">歐戰實録（五）　法國潰敗的原因 <a href="#c62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>這是三篇文章集合而成。其中首段叙述法國陸軍總動員情形，係法國女作家福德斯鳩夫人Fortescue所作。中段描寫巴黎車站的一瞥，係出紐約Herald　Tribune特派名記者湯普生女士Dorothy　Thompson手筆。末段分析法國潰敗的原因，係美國Christian　Science　Monior駐歐分社總主筆卽前任駐巴黎分社主任白隆Mallory　Browne本人的觀察及根據負責各方的報吿所得的結論。茲　譯如下：</p>
<p>外國人很少了解法軍總動員Mobilisation　Generale對於法國人是怎樣的慘酷。每一家庭間的快樂融洩，安閒靜穆，都被這幾個字摧殘凈盡了。</p>
<p>在總動員的氛圍中，我們只看見成千纍萬的法國兵，鬚髭滿面，蓬着頭，個個都是疲乏不堪，在迷惘的情况中，負着痛苦前進；有的跌倒在路旁，把充滿了鮮血的靴子解下來。還有一個兵士懷中抱着嬰孩，蹣跚隨着大隊進發。在他部員入伍前幾天，他的妻子亡故了；遺下了這個孩子，已來不及去找尋養母，卽使我得着的話，他也拿不出錢來。只有抱着這無母的嬰孩，一路等候機會，希望慈悲爲懷的女太太們，代爲領養，直到他重返故鄉，要是他能生還的話。</p>
<p>我們村莊裏的農婦們，都站在道旁觀看，她們自己的丈夫，父親，兒子們早在兩天前，動員入伍了。這些過路的兵士們，也有像他們骨肉的麼？突然間，一個粗魯的中年兵士，走出行伍，奮步跑到一位懷中抱有小孩的少婦面前，他率直的要求吻那小孩。許多婦人便哭起來了。</p>
<p>在這行伍的前後左右，常常看見那些「喪家」之犬，奔跑亂竄，東嗅西聞，尋找它們的主人。它們被遺棄在家中，奪門而出，還希冀我到主人之後一，重溫舊夢哩。</p>
<p>在這舉國惶亂之中，我們的痛苦也開始了。起先是一個佩有三粒星徽的將官，要求我們供給他部下的官兵駐紮。在宜戰之初，我們總以爲法軍不會駐在我們家裏的。現在呢，幾百個疲乏不堪的兵士，連跌帶步的進入庭院，一靠着墻便萎頹倒了下來，希望我們照顧他們。可是我們不久就感覺到供應的東西實在太缺乏了。臥室裏，起居窒中的長沙發上，和走廊裏的行軍床上，早就安置了他們的軍官。於是車間，馬廐，洗衣室，走廊等，只好統統給兵士們居住。我們把鄉村裏所有的木板草料搜集攏來，舖在泥地和水門汀地上，給他們休息。又把舊布廢袋等做爲墊褥，地毯毛氈等都在徵用之例。許多兵士還沒有領到他們的軍用毯，（要準備六百萬大軍的全副軍裝確是件艱鉅的工作）；後來把一切可以取暖的東西，像浴室裏的毯子，梳洗時用的長袍等，一併尋出來，給他們使用。</p>
<p>我們從此過着異樣的生活了。鄰居的洗衣室做了騎兵隊長的辦公室，打字機的聲音，搭搭搭的不停。馬廐變了軍用理髮室，常有兵士在裏面整容。教堂的祭台上放了法國兵的麵包和酒，這種神聖之地也給兵士們佔據了。這些兵士是在雨夜最後一批開到。其中一個兵猶豫的道，在這神聖之地，如何能躺下來呢。我說，神希望他的兒子們都得到溫飽，一定會庇護你們的。</p>
<p>在廚房裏，兵士們半裸着身，圍着石頭水櫃，互相擦背爲樂。洗衣室亦被他們擠滿了，在那里洗濯內衣。我不時到這些地方去走動，因爲兵士們正像迷途的小孩子，須要人去慰藉呢。凡是給他們一些小惠的，他們便視爲莫大之恩。譬如替他們懸上一面剃鬚的鏡子，給他們烘乾濕衣裳等瑣細事情，他們都很重視，認爲出乎意料之外的哩。</p>
<p>他們都很願意爲我工作。看見我每天早晨去採素馨花，他們都自願效勞。腰間繫上了籃，走向花巷裏，雙手採摘。採好之後，他們要求我每人拿兩朶花送給他們的妻子。並說道，他們行軍到那里，是不准對家裏人說的。現在如果把素馨花寄回家去，他們的妻子，就會知道他們還是很安全的留在風景美麗的後方呢。</p>
<p>一天早晨，我在花圃裏飽吸香草葵花和素馨的芬芳，幽美陶醉，眞不相信自己還是置身於砲火連天的世界裏。我看到了奇異的景象，在素馨花叢中，忽然出現了長鼻巨眶的怪物，蠕蠕而動。我不禁喘不過氣來，直到定睛看　，原來是兵士們戴了防毒面具在那里採花。他們的官長叫他們把防毒面具戴上一小時，以資熟練，而這一點鐘剛巧是他們的採摘素馨花的時間。</p>
<p>我對於兵士們漸漸生了愛心。他們也常把心事對我們訴說。一派銷沉的士氣，眞不是輕快的法國人在危難中所應有的。他們的將軍對我們說，郵件久久不到，兵士們出征以來，未獲隻字的家報。有一個兵士在動員時，他的妻子剛要分娩；現在不知道他妻子的生死存亡，也不知道出生的是男是女哩。還有一個兵士開拔時來不及收穫，家裏祇留着一個十六歲的女兒，靠了二十個法朗在那里度日。還有一個兵動員時旣未刈草，亦未把馬鈴薯種好。他的年邁雙親高居在山頂，在下雪之前無論如何不能收穫的。鄰居一個也沒有，騾子和車輛都被軍隊徵用，兩老靠着馬鈴薯過冬，目下音訊杳然。凡這些兵士大多數來自田間，心掛在堂上的雙親和一塊小小的田地，因爲人和地都是少不了他的！</p>
<p>他們的將官宅心仁慈，曾向我們討教，有沒有法子减少這班兵士的憂悶。因爲他們一到夜間就一起蜷縮在車間和穀倉裏，祇有一根燭火照在許多愁苦的臉上，在我們鄕村裏還沒有一個咖啡館，可供他們憇息呢。後來我們尋到有一個營帳尙未被徵用，便把它搭在村子的中央。雖然有些漏水，然而紅白相間的條子看上起倒還悅目。一到夜間，五六百個兵士擠在裏面，有的玩紙牌，有的寫家書，也有的在聽留聲機片。晚上從六點到九點，我們給他們傭了熱咖啡和朱古律糖。）</p>
<p>等到紮在我們山上的兵士開拔的消息到來時，他們之中便有許多流着眼淚。我們的通信地址簿上，平添了不少團隊營複雜的番號。兵士們又把他們妻子住址吿訴我，叫我代爲寫信通知，說他們的良人都很强健快樂，（卽使不快樂亦得這樣寫）。</p>
<p>他們在破曉之前便離去了。只見一條赤蛇似的盤山而下—許多載重車後的紅燈，載着這些兵士，漸去漸遠，不知所之。</p>
<p>他們去了，但是還有別人來，來的還要來，不知道幾時才是盡期哩。</p>
<p>巴黎的火車站月台上，兵士和他的愛人面對面站立着，他的手放在她的馬夾下面，正圍着她的腰。軍官則握着他愛人的手臂。四個人一句話也不講。</p>
<p>「法國人是最致喜講話的，」在這擁擠的月台上却默默的一無聲息。現在所要講的話，那一句不是講過了的呢？將要遇到的事情，那一件不是早已期待着的呢？</p>
<p>在巴黎車站上的兵士雖都穿着制服，但並不一樣。時代落伍的人呀，你們的臉爲什麼各各不同呢？你們是這樣的不齊，個人主義色彩是這樣的濃厚，你們有隱士的傲骨，有老於世無故的慧眼你們具有農村享樂主義者的口齒，你們愛好書本和女人；你們現在要會到蹶起的人了。</p>
<p>法國人是時代落伍的民族了。法國全人口四千二百萬，現在要敵八千萬人口的德國了。</p>
<p>兵士把他的幼女放在肩上。手撫着她的頭髮—他個人主義的！幼女的頭髮，一個希罕法國小孩。，</p>
<p>法國人口的出生率很是平穩，大家都奉行小家庭主義。一個人的能力，若能養育管教幾個孩子，他便生幾個孩予。若是一個聰敏的孩子，便送他到官立高等學校去讀書。</p>
<p>車站上，沒有人笑，也沒有人唱，更沒有軍歌。</p>
<p>一個穿黑衣裳的婦女懷中抱着小孩。面上流着淚。他的嘴脣微微的顫動着。一個九歲的男孩子站在他父母的身旁，他們倆急促而低微的說了幾句話。他哭的很悲痛，但是沒有聲音。</p>
<p>汽笛鳴嗚的響了。軍官貼着愛人的腮，兵士再和他的情婦吻一次！在那生離死別的關頭沒有人願意管別人的事。沒有人講到德國兵和戰事。沒有旗幟，沒有人行禮……更沒有說聲冉會。他們推開了，便擠上車去。他們從窗口裏望出來，—無數不同的面孔。現在他們終於笑了，慰藉的和會意的笑了。婦人女子都站了攏來，但是每個人是單獨的，每個人都被寂寞孤獨包團着，各人咸獨自的流淚。</p>
<p>火車開了。男人揚手，女人揚手，哭，笑。</p>
<p>沒有人喊「法蘭西萬歲」！法蘭西從此去矣！</p>

<p>宇林西報云、工部局物價調查處某員昨（八日）稱、本市煤柴食物等價格、今冬有校樂觀之前途、而無去歲物價奇昂之虞、煤斤情况、巴有顯著好轉、已往兩月來、煤價已見低落、計硬煤價落百分之五、優等家用煤價跌百分之二、廚房用煤價跌百分之十一、柴薪價跌百分之十四、炭價近亦低落百分之二、若干地點購煤、其價允廉、且有續跌趨勢、</p>
<p>用戶儲存助長騰貴</p>
<p>囤煤操縱者、未在煤價極高時脫手、故目下煤况，較睹前此長久時期中、已有起色、惟市民不得圃煤、以備冬需、蓋此舉將使非法牟利者乘機活動、結果徒促煤價騰貴也、</p>
<p>今冬物價必可減低</p>
<p>今料苟非發生意外、則今冬物價、將遠較去冬爲但、現本市存煤、足敷五六個一月之需、工部局對於煤况、已廣事調查、各煤斤批發商雖未向該局保證今冬煤價不致騰貴、惟就煤商對此問題之一般態度窺之、可知煤况絕無惶慮之原因、</p>
<p>食糧存貨亦復甚足</p>
<p>現煤斤之確實售價、固未較去年大減、然從邇來運費與保險費大漲一節着想、則煤售實已大跌、物價調查處不久將發表關於各種物價之詳報、至於米糧存貨亦足、麵粉每袋四十九磅、廠方售十五元、零又大陸報銷增、</p>
<p>麵粉小麥市價續跌</p>
<p>又大陸報云、據可靠方面消息、日來麵粉與小麥市價續跌、本市數週前所遇麵荒危局、今乃不復存在、緣工部局與此間日當局進行談判後、本市四週所受限制、已經取消、乃有充量之麵麥運入、存貨至少足供三個月之需、昨日麵粉市價每袋十五元、不久可望續跌、小麥每擔售十九至二十元、較前已跌二三元、</p>
<p>本市存米與日俱增</p>
<p>本市各米棧存底低較諸月前六月份、顯見驟增、据確實調查所得、存儲各該米棧存貨、數達八十萬包以上、每包以一石二斗半計達一百萬石以上、况目前每日用度已見减　、以九千包計算、足够三月之需、而商民自行覓地儲囤者尙不在內、然米價猶頻頻上漲、惟推原其故、不外下列數點、（一）國內外航輪時斷時通、人心似難安定、持貨者不肯輕易脫手、（二）改訂商業匯兌率後、黑市外匯趨緊、洋米來價稍昂、（三）業外投機商之活躍、米業中人之私做暗盤、乃使正當米商無法買賣、（四）平糶暫停、不肖米商又乘機作祟、</p>

<p>前日進口挪威商輪Foch號、由西貢直接運來洋米二萬餘包等情、已誌昨報、茲悉　輪係四川路七十號、上海木材煤料公司承租、此次由西貢裝來之洋米、不止此數、共有三萬二千三百二十四包之鉅、又太古公司岳州輪前日傍晚進口、由香港運來洋米一千一百五十九包、停靠浦東本行碼頭起卸、又悉華綸洋行大浦輪及經理巴拿馬輪Essi號、日前由西貢運米來滬、業已起卸完竣、二輪已於前昨離滬、繼續赴西貢裝米來滬、故本市洋米來源甚旺、不虞匱乏而患過剩、蓋新米早秈已有登塲、，連日大雨、卽又放晴、於農田大有裨益、囤戶米商、但知危害民食不久之將來、卽爲其失敗之日、（祖）</p>

<p>另訊、洋米早晨有內地幫新囤問津、人心堅定、售價又圖拉高三五角、然以轉口幫未有續辦、日間亦未再度辦裝、回籠英華司二號暹邏在早市雖被拉起、開六十四元之前日售開原盤、二號西貢亦以同價售出、奈實銷未有顧問、囤戶亦多觀望、獲利浮戶隨卽相繼求脫、西貢暹邏售價立被抑落半元、均開六十三元半、比前市均小半元、收市形勢依然較弱、成交祗一百多噸、現洋米早市未克扳高、後市撳落半元、存底充斥、新到不絕、市面殊乏好面、且新客秈各地上市後、倘有大量來滬亦足爲洋米之勁敵、昨皖秈又到二千多包、後著或能絡繹抵滬亦未可料也、</p>

<p>粉市趨勢步昂、查二號粉　盤、雖仍為十五元原價、本街零批交易、頗形活躍、蓋由於連日物價看高聲中、市塲空氣已轉、日廠粉更有北洋幫之垂靑、因此鳳凰牌開價步昂、本月份由十四元二角升至十四元五角、九月份初開十四元四角、旋卽昂至六角、比前再升二三角、洋粉同時趨緊、維大洋行之砲台牌及雙鷹牌等、均須十六元二角、內地雙獅牌價爲十四元六七角、統市本客成交共計一萬餘包、</p>

<p>— 心清</p>
<p>說起可怪，我是一個還未滿十八歲的青年，我是一個還未定了我自己的人生觀。環境奠我造成了一個憂鬱默語，並不悲觀的人。我隨時發覺着我在改變，前一刻的我，與此刻又有大大不同；今年的我，已不是去年的我了。</p>
<p>平時，我用眸子去觀察別人的舉動和談話，我很想在別人談得興高彩烈時，發表自己的意思，但是我總爲着別人的冷淡，將我滿腔的情緒付之流水，使我沒有說話的勇氣；這便更造成了我平日的更緘默。同時，我發覺不會說話的人是很少受到人的歡迎，特別是我帶着這樣個性的人，我很感覺到孤獨，孤獨得如同行在沙漠中的荒凉慘然。不時，我會帶些悲慘的念頭，但這却活動得浮雲般。</p>
<p>不過，我懂得生命是怎樣的渺小，而又可憐的東西，我不停地在追逐眞理，我明白眞正高尙的生活意義是怎樣一會事。我隨時在想用怎樣的方法去犧牲自己。一次，一隻很大的花蛾，停在窗格上，被人看見了大叫起來。我顧不得一切，用我爲興奮而顫抖的手指，輕輕地拿住它，放出窗外。什麼是「怕來」？在一個將生命置之度外的人，是不會理會什麼叫做畏懼的。我惟有將自己呈獻在大衆的面前，這才是我所以生活在世界上的目的。家人有信問我，將來預備學些什麼，我說：「祇要生活得有意義，就是冒死去做，我亦可以。」甚麼東西我應該學的，我却不曾想到。我記得當時會掉了不少的淚水，我應該學取做勇敢的人，如浴血抗戰一般奮不顧身的鬭士，不是爲着自己，却是爲着無計數不願屈服的人。</p>
<p>我把外界一切的刺激，變成了淸淡的態度。錢，美，聲譽，似乎都不値一顧的。人看我是一個沉默的傢伙，有人說某人沉默寡言，又有人說某人有些怪癖，這一切的斷語，我沒有猜測它的情緒；無論是好意的，或者含着尖刺的芒。我用一個堅固的信條克服一切，就是「我要在事業上越前一步，其他的問題可以置之不理，」這就是我有生以來的一偭偉大的鵠的。我覺得我能過刻苦的生活，實在能够給我不少的勇氣，鼓舞和催促，給我能不怕挫折，難免有時帶來了麻煩以及飄忽的動搖，我用它來堅固和肯定飄忽不定的意志。因此我有勇氣再生活下去。我覺得，生活就是一種奮鬭過程的必需品，我們不得不生活，所以亦不得不嘗試生活中苦辛酸辣刺激性的物味，和準備一切的鬭爭所需要的條件。我又感覺到眞諦的生活，是需要用怎樣的方法取得來的；不是不勞而獲，一舉手可以得到的東西；更不是理想主義者腦袋裏編織成美麗的蛛絲網，被風刮不經摧殘的地步，就如胰子泡破碎了般。不是和呼幺喝六的賭鬼們孤注一擲地，想拿一個小錢換得滿堆亮閃的金錢；更不是一般投機取巧的人們所採取的手段。這是最高尙尊貴正大而又可欽佩的獲得方法，用生命，寳貴的血，汗和努力換得的。正像我們所知道，穀子收穫的喜悅，是用勞力去換得來的一般。這是付相當代價收穫者的喜悅，眞的喜悅。</p>
<p>同時，更使我們驚醒，祖國的生存也是一樣的道理。我們唯有用　股不可摧殘的力量，來繼續着　爭，達到我們理想的生活。</p>
<p>我希望「生活就是戰鬭的訓練」這句話將傳送給每個人，無論老人孩子；並且每個人能切實的殘酷的生活中的　士，不怕一切，克服一切！</p>
<p>祖國的勝利是不久可以期待而來的—我們信。</p>

<p>— 崔景泰</p>
<p>聽人說過：「在苦難的生活和環境裏，我們就能看到天堂。」起初，我以為這話荒謬，最近，我才體會到這話的真切。</p>
<p>這裏，我祇說近幾年來，我的父親很窮苦，不過他是一個比較能克已的善良的人，牠對待親友，家人等，都充滿着一腔誠摯的熱情，並不因窮苦而稍有變移。我知道他是寗願自己飲苦杯，負重擔，而不忍讓家人稍有愁慮。對待那些遭遇比我家更困苦的親友，他也總是盡力濟助。溫和地無慍色，也無德色。我的心靈時常受到父親這種真摯的愛心所激動，使我意識到人生的真趣，和維繫着這宇宙與生命的愛的能九。假使，我的心懷，也像我父親這樣寬大溫柔的話，其實，我那窮苦的家庭，就是天堂了最近，父親病在醫院裏。當我第一次進去看他的時候，病房裏那一種凄凉的情景，立刻，心頭上襲來一陣人生的悲哀和畏懼·我看着父親以及其他病者那種孱弱的呻吟，和難受的神色，內心眞是說不淸楚是待而來的—我們信。</p>
<p>怎樣交錯的痛苦。父親卻還安慰我說：看護照顧美人很周到，那種仁慈的服務精神，使他很感動。病房裏，沒有炎涼的世態，而是充滿了至性的撫慰。使他竟然往往會忘去貧病或死亡的威脅。他深信在這種環境中，不久就會恢復康健的。</p>
<p>哦！我非常感激爲看護者，因爲他們具有這一種爲病人服役的熱誠。同時，我也不得不希望爲看護者，總要使他們的愛心堅貞，不要因習慣而冷淡·因爲病房裏是需要有永遠的愛呵。</p>
<p>本來，人與人間，至性的流露，在苦難中才能表現出來。假使你我都具有一顆堅貞的愛心來待人，天堂就在這看來似乎是苦難的地獄中出現了。</p>

<p>「正在想」是一個獨慕喜劇，雖然它的結局對於劇中的主人翁們是很不利的，但在讀者眼光中，這確是一幕十足滑稽的喜劇。說是「滑稽」，似乎還不十分適當，因為它決不是單純的討讀者大笑的東西，而是間有諷刺意味的作品。例如第二十頁中的「老窩瓜」想賣弄他的「天才」，而被他的兒子「小禿子」揭穿醜態的一段，雖然很可引人一笑，但在這「一笑之中却很有一番幽默味的。</p>
<p>劇情方面，它不像「雷雨」那樣的　巧，也不像「日出」那樣的悲慘，更沒有像「原野」那樣的具有壯烈氣，但它却也失爲一本値得細細一讀的作品</p>
<p>因爲這是一本喜劇，所以在作者方面，也許是很費力的。（以普通情形而言，喜劇的寫作是較寫悲劇爲難的，因爲喜劇不易動人）。但無可否認，「正在想」的作者之「費力」得到了相當效果，他不但把主人　「老窩瓜」和「小甜瓜」寫得奕奕如生，就是作爲配角的「小紅」與「丁老師」，作者也把她們刻劃得若有其人，她們的性格和外表，我以爲是全劇中作者描摹得最動人最有趣的二個</p>
<p>誠然「正在想」的劇情沒有曹禺的從前三部劇本那樣的緊巧悲慘壯烈，然其成績却並不遜於「雷雨」「日出」或是「原野」，這自然是由於作者努力的結果，但天賦的寫劇天才也正是幫助作者編劇的一股力量。希望曹禺能善自用力！</p>

<p>第五章　惡消息</p>
<p>霍桑答道：「就眼前而論，的確如此。不過你總也明白，這一件案子有直接關係的，決不止一個人。我們不能把目光偏重在他一個人身上。」</p>
<p>我仍抗辯說：「雖不能偏重，可也不能絕不注重。」</p>
<p>霍桑點點頭，並不回答。</p>
<p>我又說：「那本，你對於怎樣找尋這趙伯雄，可巳有具體的計劃？」</p>
<p>霍桑搖搖頭。「還沒有，不過要找到這個人，我想也不見得怎樣困難。他旣然在這裏住過一個月，朋友又不少，他能和王麗蘭交識，一定又是常在舞場或其他交際場中出進的。此外，我們又有他的照片——唉，電梯下來了。」</p>
<p>電梯從八層上下來，開了門，我們便走進去。它到了底層，我們離開電梯。後，翟桑又向那兩面下班的電話間走去，說要問問倪金壽有沒有回署。他走進電話間以後，讓門開着，我站在外面，他的談話也聽得見。電話接通以後，他很高興，分明倪金壽已回警署了。</p>
<p>他向電話筒中說道：「金壽兄，我是霍桑。……有什麼消息？……什麼？陸健笙昨夜不曾到過揚子旅社？……奇怪！……唉！我聽不淸楚·……啞，跟余甘棠同宿舍的有一個姓劉的，是不是？……唔，唔……姓劉的怎麼說？……余甘棠昨夜半夜以後才回宿舍？……可曾說幾點鐘？……沒有說定嗎？……對，就是這個時間已够可疑。……」</p>

<h3 id="c114">七夕談劇 <a href="#c114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>— 君美</p>
<p>梨園故事，向重應節戲劇，如元旦之靑石山，端午之混元盒，中秋之天香慶節，在早年應節戲中，蓋所以聊示點綴而已。近年以來，應節戲成爲梨園慣例，如元宵之上元夫人，斗牛官，元宵謎，鬧花燈；淸明之蟠桃會，小上墳，蝴蝶夢；中元之盂蘭聖會；中秋之奔月；重陽之焚綿山；除夕之小過年；無節不應，亦居然盛極一時。一年容易，又話牽牛，今日七夕良宵，雙星銀漢，戲報遂無不大書特書「天河配」矣。</p>
<p>天河配脫胎於崑弋，早年演此，皆貼渡銀河，劇中穿挿</p>
<p>鵲橋密誓並以崑曲長生殿一折爲之點染，當時各班演此最著者，有雙慶班之韓春利牛郎，狄春仙織女，陸杏林明皇，吳麟仙楊妃；福壽班之陸華雲明皇，諸秋芬楊妃，張芷荃織女，以及雙慶社燈彩天河配之朱素雲牛郎王蕙芳織女，劉景然張守田，則已別創一格。自王瑤卿演後，故事遂漸涉神話，附會增益，年有新聲，顧派別雖雜，而內容則不外兄弟分家，蓮池沐浴，牛神下界，極盡熱鬧火熾之能事而已。七夕演天河配，至今允膾炙人口者，則當推民三故都之第一舞台，不僅角色硬整，如王瑤卿之織女，金仲仁之牛郎，張文斌之嘎氏，賈洪林之張有才，李連仲之金牛星，李順亭之玉帝，姚佩蘭·王麗卿·諸茹香等之諸仙女，更因大轉台之號召，蓮池噴眞水，鵲橋以電燈嵌成，富皇矞麗，開立體佈景之先河，一時莫與之京。其次，民八七夕梅碗華出演天河配於故都新明，梅飾織女，而以高慶奎飾張守義，李敬山飾嘎氏，李連仲飾金牛星，扎金奎飾玉帝，趙芝香飾玉后，羅福山飾瑤池金母，益以萬盞燈·小鳳凰·諸茹香·王麗卿·朱桂芳·姚玉芙·芙蓉草·程艷秋飾八仙女，</p>
<p>清歌妙舞</p>
<p>旑旎風光，其搭配之齊整，五雀六燕，可謂空前絕後。近年來演天河配有好作反串者，曾記郝壽臣與高慶奎曾一度爲之，蓮池沐浴一塲，郝穿大紅肚兜，紅抹子鞋，以大花臉，作風流態，觀者無不捧腹，亦頗有怪趣也。海派天河配，摻入特別開打，戲中串戲，可謂生面別開，據云肇端於小三麻子與喜彩蓮合作時，其內容略謂：「織女未下凡之前，某日大雨，雀王爲雷神所迫，逃入織女座下始免，自是卽心感其德，適織女嫁牛郎後有難產之厄，雀王乃爲盜靈芝，致與鹿鶴二童開打，誕生後更大辦彌月，遂有戲中串戲」，雖匪伊所思，要亦極視聽之娛矣。往年七夕</p>
<p>演天河配</p>
<p>自七夕起至多不過連演五六夕，近年以來，戲園爭奇鬭異，務求炫耀，以之演期亦破往例，甫將七月，卽相率出演，前年尙小雲主持之榮春社在故都演天河配，連演達十八塲之多，座無隙地，更屬打破七夕演天河配之新紀錄。榮春此劇之特點，在於終塲時之「積木成圖，擺燈成宇」，所謂積木成圖，卽係仿兒童玩具之積木，加以放大，由三十二童各持其一，擺成各種樓台亭閣，橋樑牌樓，動作敏捷齊整，至爲美觀。所謂一擺燈成字」，則由五童各手持蓮花燈二盞，穿荷葉裳，束髮金冠，大鼓鼕鼕，隨聲動作，成梅花一字等式，鼓聲甫息，羣燈閃爍而置燈成「七夕乞巧」四字，雲蒸霞蔚，蔚爲大觀。尙氏匠心獨運，宜其可以叫座至十八塲之久也。七夕應景戲，除天天河斬龍，子晋跨鶴二劇，往年於七夕承應大內，故民間甚少流傳，卽知者亦鮮。至於一度出演之雲錦裳，當年雷喜福李蓮貞曾演之，蓮貞節織女，喜福飾郭汾陽，及蓮貞故世而此戲遂絕。又有織錦記，演孝子董永事，相思硯，更羅致孫悟空加入，及雙星會諸劇，要皆事幻而情雜，至今已默默無聞矣。</p>

<h3 id="e1">British War Department Decides to Withdraw Troops Stationed in Shanghai and North China; British Embassy in Tokyo Formally Notifies Japanese Authorities; States Reservation of Rights Granted by the Peking Treaty <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>The London War Department announced that British troops currently stationed in Shanghai and North China are to be withdrawn and transferred elsewhere for service. According to responsible sources, the existing British forces consist of two battalions stationed in Tianjin and Shanghai, with a half-squadron serving as guards for the British Embassy in Peiping. Originally, the British forces stationed in the aforementioned areas were more numerous than this; however, some time ago, one battalion had already been transferred from Peiping and Tianjin. From a strictly military point of view, the deployment of this small number of troops in widely separated locations has more disadvantages than advantages. However, if these troops are concentrated in other locations, they will become a key military point. (Reuter, 9th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: According to an announcement made by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman at 7 PM today, the British Embassy in Tokyo has notified the Japanese government of the withdrawal of British troops stationed in China. The announcement stated that at 6 PM today, Mr. Hunt, First Secretary of the British Embassy, acting on the instructions of his government, visited Mr. Nishi, Director of the European and Asian Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and presented a formal note stating that the British government has decided to withdraw its garrison troops stationed in Shanghai, Peiping, and Tianjin in China to serve elsewhere. The note also stated that the British government reserves all rights granted under the Peking Treaty of July 7, 1901, until such treaty is amended or repealed by the countries concerned. (Reuter, 9th)</p>
<p>Shanghai: The commander of the British forces stationed in Shanghai and North China issued a formal statement at 6 PM tonight stating that the British forces stationed in Shanghai and North China are now to be withdrawn for service elsewhere. (Reuter)</p>
<p>The London War Department has formally announced that British troops currently stationed in Shanghai and North China will be withdrawn and transferred elsewhere for service. (United Press, 9th)</p>
<p>Stockholm: The British War Department announced this morning that Britain will soon withdraw its troops stationed in Shanghai and North China. (Haitong News Agency, 9th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Chinese observers here have commented on the British withdrawal of troops from China, stating that the British move is for one of two reasons: either to appease Japan or to strengthen its position against Japan in preparation for war in the Far East. (United Press, 9th)</p>
<p>London: Authoritative sources here have stated that there are currently over 1,500 British troops in Shanghai, including the 2nd Battalion, East Surrey Regiment, the 1st Battalion, West Yorkshire Regiment, and other units. They also stated that the British intention to withdraw troops from Shanghai has already been communicated to the United States and Japan. The garrison in Shanghai was originally intended to protect the International Settlement, but the British government now believes that the number of troops is too large and that it would be better to use them to strengthen other locations in the Far East, such as Hong Kong and Singapore. The British government has been considering the withdrawal of these troops since the beginning of the European War. Authoritative sources also recalled that in January of last year, the British War Department announced that the British garrisons in Tianjin and Peiping should be reduced to the extent necessary to protect property and maintain order. The British Press Association stated that Britain is currently engaged in war and should properly manage its troops. British military sources said that the British troops to be withdrawn from China will be the East Surrey Regiment and the West Yorkshire Regiment stationed in Shanghai, but the East Surrey Regiment in Tianjin may remain. Neutral observers also recalled that at the beginning of the European War, Japan requested that the belligerent countries withdraw their troops stationed in the Japanese-occupied areas of China to avoid incidents that would affect Japan's policy of non-participation in the European War. British troops were sent to Shanghai in 1927. (United Press, 9th)</p>

<p>A Chinese artillery company on the south bank of the Yellow River east of Shanxi has been displaying its might for days, shelling the town of Monan, causing heavy losses and panic among the Japanese. Japanese strongholds in Yongji, Zhao Village, and Dongzhang have been attacked by the Chinese forces separately, posing a threat to the Japanese, who are constantly transporting supplies and heavy equipment north. (8th)</p>
<p>Luoyang: On the 3rd, over a thousand Japanese soldiers with more than ten artillery pieces, and on the 4th, over a thousand Japanese soldiers with five or six artillery pieces, attacked Makuzhen, Gaopingguan (west of Gaoping), and other places. Fierce fighting with the Chinese army is ongoing. At the same time, many Japanese troops have recently been increased in the Lucheng area from Changzhi, attempting to attack Licheng to the north. However, if the Japanese dare to attack, they will be dealt a heavy blow. (8th)</p>

<p>Liuzhou: On the morning of the 6th, a unit of the Chinese army in southern Guangxi attacked the Japanese in Nalan, Huitouling, and Changgangshan, engaging in fierce fighting, annihilating more than half of the Japanese forces. The remaining Japanese retreated to Nalan, cowering inside fortifications and attempting to hold out. The two strongholds of Huitouling and Changgangshan have been recaptured by the Chinese. The annihilation is ongoing. (9th)</p>
<p>Liuzhou: On the 3rd, the Japanese along the Yongqin Road advanced from Nameng towards Wulan, but were met with a head-on blow from a unit of the Chinese army. Many Japanese were killed by the evening, and the Japanese forces were greatly frustrated. The Chinese are still fiercely attacking. (9th)</p>

<h3 id="e5">Battle Situation Quiet for the Past Week <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing: The battle situation in various regions has been quiet for the past week, but the fierce attacks launched by the Chinese army on the Japanese in local areas have caused great panic among the Japanese, who can only stubbornly defend their strongholds in an attempt to protect themselves. Regarding the recent activities of the Japanese army, a military spokesperson said that when the Japanese first attacked Yichang, their forces were insufficient, and they barely managed to gather a part of their troops from Hunan and Jiangxi to support them. Now that the battle is over, they have suffered heavy losses and have had to return to their original defenses to recuperate. Therefore, rumors of new Japanese attempts are completely unfounded. The Japanese are exhausted and unable to struggle, and the international environment is unfavorable, so they dare not try again rashly. (8th)</p>

<h3 id="e9">Foreign Currency and Legal Tender <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the foreign exchange market in Shanghai has suddenly become tight again. The reasons for this are varied: some say it is due to the heavy settlement of import goods, some say it is due to fluctuations in the international situation, some say it is due to the revision of commercial exchange rates, and some say it is due to speculators manipulating the market. All of these may account for some proportion of the situation. In trade and international relations, the ebb and flow of supply and demand causes market prices to rise and fall, which is normal for foreign exchange and not surprising. However, a closer look reveals that when exchange rates are stable, it should be a time for industry and commerce to engage in buying and selling, but in reality, supply and demand are weak and indifferent, as if they have forgotten each other. It is only when prices rise again that activity is seen, which is even more abnormal. Some unscrupulous people take the opportunity to spread alarming and absurd rumors in order to stir up public opinion. Those who hear these rumors do not investigate and become alarmed and suspicious. They are misled by the temporary rise in the price of foreign currency, thinking that it will become even more expensive, and rush to buy and hoard foreign currency as a good plan. This does no harm to the legal tender itself, but the market value of the legal tender is bound to depreciate relatively. Therefore, those who depreciate it, and those who suffer the most from the depreciation, are not others, but those who rely on legal tender for their livelihood and have some surplus to buy foreign currency.</p>
<p>It is important to know that foreign currencies are controlled by foreign countries. Whether there is a problem with the currency itself is the first question; whether there is a problem with the safety of the country is the second question; if there is no problem with the currency itself and no problem with the safety of the country, whether there is a problem with the policies adopted by the government is the third question. It is a pity that the masses are blind and forgetful. Do they not see the outbreak of the European War and its sudden expansion? The countries of Europe were successively drawn into the vortex, and those who had deposits in the trading houses of the belligerent countries in Shanghai were panicked and did not know what to do, worried and embarrassed. Do they not remember the sudden ceasefire between Germany and France? The currency market in Shanghai had no market price for French francs and Annam piasters for a long time; at that time, people were scrambling to sell them but could not find buyers. These storms are by no means unexpected. Have the blind not seen them? Have the forgetful not remembered them? They should know that the world is changing rapidly, and these storms are by no means the end of the world, but the beginning of the world. Following these storms, there may be storms of a more dramatic nature, storms of a wider scope, and storms of a longer duration. Now that Germany and Italy have achieved local victories, who knows whether their financial policies will be revolutionary and far-reaching? Britain is preparing for a long war, who knows whether its wartime finance will be subject to unusually strict controls? The United States is full of gold, and for the sake of political use, for the sake of commodity development, for the sake of passive patching or active support, will it be frozen, will it be obstructed, or will it be devalued and circulated freely? All of these are impossible to foresee. Exhausting our minds to study and speculate on them, all kinds of possibilities are presented together, and while we think we are using our intelligence to seize opportunities, we are still no different from calling out random numbers. Black and white, gain and loss, half and half. Therefore, to say that buying and hoarding foreign currency can bring peace of mind is a deceitful talk, and it is a great self-deception.</p>
<p>The sky is full of doubt, and thorns are everywhere. The situation is such, and there are many forks in the road ahead. We secretly believe that our argument is not too far off. Let's talk about the near term: if there are buyers, there must be sellers, otherwise there will be no market and no market price. Those who are now spending legal tender to buy and hoard foreign currency think they are smart. Who is absorbing the legal tender and selling the foreign currency? Is it not the banks and foreign merchants? Are the calculations of banks and foreign merchants not as smart as yours? From this alone, it can be seen that legal tender has its own substance and its own position in international currency. Since it has substance and a position, why do the Chinese, who are its masters, not hesitate to harm themselves and blindly follow others to depreciate it? How can this not be the utmost foolishness! It seems that those who harm themselves are not worth pitying, but from a broader perspective, there is even more that cannot be forgiven. Why? China is in the midst of war, and currency is the national defense of the economy. Economic warfare is one aspect of total warfare, and currency competition is one part of it. Therefore, those who are against China are also against legal tender, and they are happy to destroy legal tender. Those who do not cherish legal tender and depreciate it for others are no different from lightly handing over national defense tools to others, and no different from lightly surrendering. From the perspective of China, can this be forgiven? Some may say that obtaining foreign currency is not an offensive against foreign currency? This is sophistry. It is almost acceptable to use domestic goods to obtain foreign currency, but if you depreciate yourself to obtain it, then the gains do not outweigh the losses. This is a clear principle.</p>

<p>Tokyo: Relevant authorities announced today that negotiations between French Ambassador Henri and the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the Vietnam issue are currently being conducted in a most amicable manner. It is understood that the northern border of Vietnam has been blockaded. At the same time, a plan for reciprocal agreements by Japanese economic envoys will be submitted to the French authorities for approval. The contents of the agreement drafted by the Japanese are not yet known. News from Vichy today confirmed that French-Japanese negotiations are underway to adjust the political and economic relations between France and Japan in the Far East. The Vichy communique stated,</p>
<p>Vichy Government's authoritative communique stated that the Japanese Foreign Minister and the French Ambassador have recently continued negotiations in Tokyo on political and military plans related to French-Japanese relations in a friendly spirit. The communique did not specify the so-called military plans. However, news reports indicate that the Japanese side is pressuring France to establish bases in Vietnam to accelerate the end of the war against the Chongqing government. Negotiations on this matter have been underway here. The authoritative communique stated that since the end of June, attacks have occurred. It is also claimed that the Chinese army, in view of the serious situation caused by the Japanese demands, has concentrated a large force near the Vietnamese border near Gaoping. It is rumored that the Chinese side has concentrated 200,000 troops in the area, preparing to rush south to Hanoi from Gaoping after the end of the rainy season if the Japanese army occupies the railway at Haiphong to transport troops to the Yunnan border. It is generally believed that the Governor of Vietnam expressed his desire to remain neutral in the Sino-Japanese War last week. Unless the Governor of Vietnam changes this attitude, the French troops stationed on the Vietnamese border may resist the entry of the Chinese army. (Central News Agency, 9th)</p>
<p>Hong Kong Overseas News: Nishihara, the head of the Japanese investigation team sent to Annam, flew from Taipei to Guangzhou and then to Hanoi at 9:00 this morning. Nishihara departed from Tokyo yesterday morning. (9th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Japanese newspapers today reported that after Major General Nishihara arrives in Hanoi, he will begin negotiations on suspending commercial relations between Vietnam and Chongqing. At the same time, Foreign Minister Matsuoka said that there were no military concentrations on the Japanese side. Passengers also stated that the situation in Vietnam was as calm as usual. There were no changes in the Pearl River situation, and all shipping was temporarily suspended. In this case, the majority of Hong Kong's fresh food supplies must rely on Macau for supplies, as the border is continuously controlled by the Japanese. (Reuter, 9th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: A Foreign Ministry spokesman said today that, in accordance with the Anglo-Japanese agreement, the transportation of war supplies to the Chongqing government via the Burma Road has been suspended for three months. There is no time limit for the suspension of transportation via the Vietnam route, so the suspension of transportation of supplies to the Chongqing government via Vietnam can be implemented for a long time. When Japan and France begin negotiations on Vietnam, they will be conducted simultaneously by both governments and local authorities. The spokesman also mentioned that when Foreign Minister Matsuoka replied to US Ambassador Grew's inquiry on Wednesday, he said that the news in foreign newspapers about the negotiations on the Vietnam issue between France and Japan was inaccurate.

<p>London: Member of Parliament Mandel, a member of the opposition Liberal Party, asked the government in the House of Commons yesterday whether it would announce the full terms of the Anglo-Japanese agreement to blockade the Burma Road. Undersecretary of State Butler replied that what Foreign Secretary Halifax could add to Churchill's remarks on July 18 was that the goods temporarily banned from transportation on the road included steel, rails, trains, motorcycles, trucks and their parts, weapons, ammunition, and military explosives.

<p>Chongqing: The wartime excess profits tax has been levied for many days and has achieved excellent results. Although a small number of merchants who do not understand the big picture hope to obstruct it, the Executive Yuan has already issued orders to the provinces and cities to severely refute them in order to maintain tax administration. According to relevant sources, the current tax rate for excessive wartime profits in our country is 10% at the lowest and 50% at the highest, which is far different from the tax rates in Britain, France, and the United States. Moreover, excessive profits are created by opportunity. The government has increased the tax obligations of those who enjoy such rights, both harmonizing social inequality and increasing national income to offset the loss of the three major indirect taxes of customs, salt, and consolidated tax due to the war. The tax rate is fair, and the burden on taxpayers is very light. There is really no reason to object. The government is now using various methods to increase social awareness of the tax system.

<p>Chongqing: Today, Chongqing experienced a fierce air raid. Multiple waves of Japanese planes simultaneously bombed Biancheng (north bank of the Yangtze River), the western part of the Jialing River's north bank, and the south bank of the Yangtze River in Chongqing. The casualties and damage situation are currently unknown, but several fires were started. It is said that this was Japan's first intentional bombing of the south bank because, until now, the area has always been considered a safe zone. The embassies of Great Britain, the United States, France, Italy, Belgium, and the Netherlands, as well as many foreign trading companies, are located there, along with British and American gunboats and ships moored nearby. Chinese sources say that the Japanese planes this time dropped bombs on the south bank from the Haitangxi (transliterated) wharf all the way to Longmenhao (transliterated), where the embassies and gunboats are located. Previously, only stray bullets had fallen in this area. The air raid alarm here was sounded this morning when thirty-six Japanese planes were spotted flying towards this area. However, these Japanese planes circled Zhijiang, on the highway south of Chongqing, awaiting the arrival of other Japanese planes. It is believed that at least two waves of Japanese planes participated in the air raid on Chongqing, while two other waves of Japanese planes bombed a certain location some distance from Chongqing. The sound of their bombs exploding could only be heard faintly here. As the Japanese planes carried out the bombing, powerful Chinese fighter squadrons made at least two dive-bombing attacks. The all-clear was sounded at 4:00 PM. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Today's raid on Chongqing by one hundred Japanese planes resulted in over a thousand casualties among the city's residents. Six major fires broke out, and the properties of the American Methodist Church suffered heavy damage. These casualty figures are still just rough estimates. On the south bank of the Yangtze River, while men, women, and children were hurrying to underground shelters, ruthless bombs fell and exploded. The business department of the Central Daily News was also destroyed. Twelve bombs hit the Methodist Church's middle school, with flames erupting in front of the gate. Several school buildings were also damaged. Several bombs also landed near the new British Embassy building, but it was not damaged. (United Press, 9th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: As Chongqing's heatwave reached 100 degrees Fahrenheit, one hundred Japanese planes were again seen in the skies above the city, causing six major fires to break out inside and outside the city, on the south bank of the Yangtze River, and on the north bank of the Jialing River. A middle school belonging to the American Methodist Church was damaged. The bombed and burned areas on the south bank of the Yangtze River were near the American Embassy and other foreign properties. The Methodist Church's school buildings were heavily damaged, and its physics laboratory was completely destroyed. (United Press, 9th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: At 10:30 AM on the 9th, sixty-three Japanese planes were spotted flying westward over Yidu in Hubei, entering the airspace over Chongqing around 2:00 PM. At 10:37 AM, twenty-seven Japanese planes were spotted over Changyang, also entering the city's airspace simultaneously. They dropped numerous bombs in areas such as Daliangzi, Chaotianmen, Shangqingsi, Zengjia Piao, and Haitang Man Longmenhao on the south bank, which the Japanese had previously claimed they would not bomb. After fierce attacks by the Chinese Air Force and anti-aircraft units, the Japanese planes fled eastward in a panic, and three were heavily damaged and are expected to crash en route.

<h3 id="e21">Hong Kong Governor Norden Pays Attention to Defense <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>Hong Kong: Major General Norden, the acting governor of Hong Kong who arrived here this week, is paying the greatest attention to Hong Kong's defenses, given the unpredictable changes in the international situation and Japan's repeated threats to join the German-Italian Axis. Norden is a current military officer who previously commanded artillery in India. His temporary assignment to this position was accompanied by instructions to strengthen Hong Kong's defenses. Although the commander of the British garrison in Hong Kong can control all British troops stationed in China, General Norden has the highest authority over Hong Kong's defenses. Therefore, Norden is acting as governor and concurrently serving as the commander-in-chief of Hong Kong's garrison. This is the first time in forty years that an active-duty military officer has served as governor of Hong Kong, as the position has traditionally been filled by a civil servant. Although the evacuation of British women and children to Australia has been criticized by English newspapers as damaging the government's "image" and "wasting" government money, it continues unabated due to the unstable international situation. The decision-making power does not lie with the Hong Kong authorities but with the Colonial Office in London. In recent days, rumors have been circulating here that Germany has successfully persuaded Japan to join the Axis powers. The alleged terms are that Japan would attack Hong Kong, but Vietnam must not be invaded. According to these rumors, which do not originate from the recent statements made by Japanese Prime Minister Konoe and Foreign Minister Matsuoka, the two have declared that Japan will adopt an independent foreign policy and does not wish to join the European war. Their tone suggests that they harbor ambitions towards Vietnam and will not allow third-party interference. Furthermore, Hong Kong does not possess the resources of Vietnam or the Dutch East Indies. Its importance as a port lies in the fact that large quantities of Japanese goods can be dumped from here into Free China, the Malay Peninsula, Borneo, and other British territories in the Far East. It is estimated that Japanese goods worth 4 million Japanese yen are shipped through Hong Kong each month. Chinese analysts here do not believe that Japan intends to join the German side in the war because Japan is already bogged down in the war in China. They believe that the future of the war in Britain will determine the fate of Hong Kong. In any case, the British forces in Hong Kong are unlikely to take any action. It should be noted that the Japanese army is already on Hong Kong's border, and the Japanese air force can fly from Guangzhou to Hong Kong in just half an hour. (International News Agency, 9th)</p>

<p>Tokyo: A Foreign Ministry spokesman stated today that the arrest of British overseas Chinese suspected of espionage by Japan and the arrest of Japanese overseas Chinese by Britain were both internal plans of the respective governments. According to reports, the atmosphere in the London press has recently shown a clear improvement. When asked if there were any new developments in British-Japanese negotiations, the spokesman replied that there had been no new developments since British Ambassador Craigie visited Foreign Minister Matsuoka a few days ago, and the atmosphere had not changed. After the British ambassador met with the foreign minister, the two held talks in a calm and friendly atmosphere. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>London: Undersecretary Butler stated yesterday during questioning in the House of Commons that nine British overseas Chinese detained in Japan had been released, and one had died. The circumstances of his death are currently under investigation. There are still six people in detention. British Ambassador Craigie has held several discussions with Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka on this matter, and negotiations are underway, which are not expected to be delayed. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: The "Nichi Nichi Shimbun" recently reported that after the military arrested several British expatriates on charges of espionage, letters flooded the Army Ministry from all directions, advocating a thorough cleansing of foreign spies. Some letter writers even pointed out that some of the regulations promulgated by the government actually help foreign spies. The most important of these is the recently promulgated new commercial law, which compels all joint-stock companies to publish their business accounts for the past year. Even factories related to military industry are included in the list. If foreign espionage agencies were to meticulously study these reports, it would not be difficult to get a complete picture of Japan's economic situation. This situation is particularly obvious for various state-run industries. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: It has recently been learned that the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department has decided to expand the organization of the Foreign Affairs Section in the near future in order to strengthen the prevention of foreign spy activities. In addition to Chinese overseas Chinese, there are as many as 3,600 expatriates of various countries in Tokyo, who must be strictly guarded against. In the future, inspections of foreign passports must be intensified, and the Metropolitan Police Department should send personnel to audit foreign professors lecturing at universities and specialized schools for supervision. For this reason, personnel in the Foreign Affairs Section feel that they are not adequately staffed. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>Japanese East Asia Federation Advocates Declaration of War Against Britain</p>
<p>Tokyo: The anti-British movement in Japan is intensifying. The right-wing Japanese East Asia Federation has passed a resolution advocating that Japan immediately declare war on Britain. It is reported that last night, 126 members of the Japanese parliament passed a motion demanding that the government take all effective measures to expel British forces from East Asia. Following this, there was this resolution demanding a declaration of war. The East Asia Federation has now sent this resolution to Prime Minister Konoe, Army Minister Tojo, Navy Minister Yoshida, and Foreign Minister Matsuoka, requesting a declaration of war against Britain in retaliation for the British arrest of Japanese people. It is also reported that police here yesterday arrested a man with a handgun in front of the residence of former Finance Minister Ikeda, who is considered to be a pro-British Japanese person.

<p>Shimla: Indian Governor-General Linlithgow declared yesterday that the British government cannot abandon its existing responsibilities for the security and welfare of India, nor can it be coerced into transferring this responsibility to any regime. This is beyond doubt. The claim that constitutional drafting should be the responsibility of the Indian people themselves is now quite firm. The British government expresses sympathy for this aspiration and wishes to see it realized, but only on the condition that it does not violate the fulfillment of its responsibilities towards India. Now that Britain is engaged in a struggle for survival, this is not the time to substantively resolve fundamental constitutional issues. This is obvious. However, the British government instructs me to announce that the British government is eager to form a delegation of representatives of the major components of Indian national life as soon as possible after the end of the war to draft a new constitution. The British government is willing to assist in promoting the decision on various events to the best of its ability. At the same time, the British government is willing to welcome and promote in every possible way various sincere and practical steps that the Indian people themselves can take to establish a friendly and appropriate basis for the form that the postwar delegation should take, the methods that the delegation should decide, and the principles and outlines of the constitution itself. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>Shimla: Governor-General of India, Lord Linlithgow, made the following remarks yesterday, which are of profound constitutional significance. Last October, the British government reiterated its objectives for India, which were to create dominion status and stated that it was prepared to approve the expansion of the Governor-General's Council, including representatives of several political parties, and proposed the establishment of an advisory committee. For the sake of facilitating harmonious cooperation, it is essential that the major parties in each province reach a compromise. Unfortunately, this compromise was not achieved, and progress was impossible under the circumstances at the time. Mr. Linlithgow further stated after describing his efforts to eliminate prejudice among the various political parties that it was obvious that the differences of opinion that had previously hindered the establishment of national unity had not been eliminated. The British government deeply regrets this prolonged situation and believes that it should not continue any longer. Because of the existence of these differences of opinion, the expansion of the Governor-General's Council and the establishment of mechanisms to more closely integrate Indian public opinion with the central government's war effort have been delayed. The British government has instructed him to invite several exemplary Indians to participate in his Executive Council and to establish a War Advisory Committee, scheduled to meet regularly, consisting of representatives from various Indian states and others concerned about the Indian nation. Mr. Linlithgow concluded by saying that the opinions of minority ethnic groups regarding any amendments to the constitutional structure would be given full consideration. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>London: The British newspapers criticized the Indian Governor-General's remarks on the issue of Indian constitutional drafting, all believing that this was an important step towards India's dominion status. The Times stated that the Governor-General's announcement indicated that the current government's policy towards India was a major improvement compared to the previous government. It recognized the Indian people's right to self-determination and stipulated in a practical way the expansion of Indian autonomy within the time before the final decision on the future constitution. The whole of India knows that Hitlerism is the enemy of Indian culture. The Governor-General's invitation to Indian parties to join the Executive Council gives Indian parties an opportunity to cooperate on an equal footing. The Daily Telegraph stated that this opportunity is of great significance and that success or failure depends on whether the Indian people can resolve their own disputes. The Governor-General's proposal is extremely rational. The Manchester Guardian stated that the White Paper's conditions are ambiguous, but the drafting of a new constitution can meet the long-standing demands of Indian friends. This is truly an opportunity. If the preliminary work produces a quick compromise, the British government will definitely accept this result and implement it. The Daily Herald stated that it is doubtful whether this proposal will be more successful than the autonomy measures proposed in the past. Now is not the time to haggle, but there should be brave, swift, and generous political measures to fulfill the promises without hesitation. (Reuters, 9th)</p>

<p>Washington: The Senate yesterday passed the National Defense Military Law, authorizing the President to mobilize the National Guard and reserves for one year of service. The bill authorizes the President to send soldiers and reservists to any area within the Western Hemisphere, including the Philippines. Although the bill did not encounter strong opposition in the Senate yesterday, it did spark strong debate. The passage of this bill is tantamount to opening the way for the "Burke-Wadsworth" conscription bill, allowing 12 million men aged 21 to 31 to undergo one year of compulsory military training. Observers believe that about twelve senators met yesterday to discuss organizing a line of opposition to the conscription bill, but the bill will still be passed next week. According to one member of the opposition, this faction is now laying the foundation to oppose the New Deal's foreign policy, "because that policy is now showing us the path to drag our country into war." Administrative leaders who support the conscription bill do not believe that the isolationists have the power to overthrow the bill. They predict that this opposition will only be able to obtain a maximum of 24 votes. The biggest obstacle to the bill is the authorization for President Roosevelt to send the National Guard and reserves outside of US territory, including the Philippines, as this move carries the risk of dragging the United States itself into the whirlpool of war. However, this section was passed after fierce debate. (Associated Press, 9th)</p>

<p>Washington: US Treasury Secretary Morgenthau stated that Britain has appointed Brigadier General Billatt as the official liaison officer for the US-British procurement contract negotiations. Britain wants to order tanks in the US, but it would not be appropriate if the tanks made in the US and Britain were of different designs. Therefore, the British authorities have decided to contribute their experience to the design of American tanks so that American military tanks can adapt to the development of new-style warfare, so as to create standard weapons that can be used by both countries.

<h3 id="e37">US-Dutch East Indies Commercial Relations Expanding; Changes to the Status Quo Not Permitted by the US <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>San Francisco: According to a survey by the Pacific Institute, the Dutch East Indies is a major supplier of raw materials for the United States. The Dutch East Indies' commerce with the US has risen from eighth place in 1933 and seventh place in 1939. Until recently, the American Petroleum Company, through Mobil, controlled 40 percent of the petroleum in the Dutch East Indies, while American rubber merchants, through Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Company, accounted for fourth place in the Dutch East Indies' rubber investment. The US has rubber interests in the island in order to avoid relying on foreign supply. The above are some of the reasons for the strong attitude of US Secretary of State Hull on April 17. Hull warned that the United States could not remain indifferent to any changes in the status quo of the Dutch East Indies, as the United States, like other countries, relies on the Dutch East Indies for major raw materials such as rubber, tin, quinine, and dried coconut meat. In fact, the Netherlands has a monopoly on the world's quinine market due to the Dutch East Indies' abundant quinine production. American investment in the Dutch East Indies is not as welcome as British investment, although in 1929, American investment reached a peak of US$201.3 million. At the beginning of this year, the US had a trend to expand its interests. Philippine manufacturing companies planned to lease 10,000 square miles of land to plant palm trees and build a palm oil factory. Another American company was preparing to establish an artificial milk oil factory in Surabaya. Mobil's construction of a high-octane aviation gasoline factory, worth millions of US dollars, has recently been completed. Other American companies with interests in the Dutch East Indies include the Palmolive Company, General Motors, RKO Pictures, and Sidera Trading. From an investment perspective, the US ranked fourth in 1929. Of the 2,065,000,000 guilders in foreign investment, the Netherlands accounted for 74.4%, Britain accounted for 13.5%, France and Belgium accounted for 5.4%, the US accounted for 2.6%, and Japan accounted for 0.9%. Most of the investment was in the production of sugar, rubber, tobacco, palm oil, coffee, tea, cinchona bark, fiber, coconut, and betel nut paste. (Associated Press, 9th)</p>

<p>Various individuals in Geneva believe that while Japan's interests may outwardly seem aligned with those of the Axis powers, they actually conflict with Germany's colonial policies. The German newspaper Frankfurter Zeitung, in an article last Sunday, outlined Germany's view on the colonies of the Pétain government in the Far East, stating that the entire European political sphere should include the colonies of the Netherlands, France, Italy, and Spain. In reality, there is a genuine connection between the European continent and its colonies. In essence, the colonies of Europe should belong to Europe. Germany and Italy historically and politically bear the responsibility of maintaining peace in Europe, and therefore, they also bear the same responsibility for the future status of European territories, the new order of Europe, and colonial issues. Hence, geographical Europe and political Europe are inseparable. The pro-Japanese Geneva Daily Tribune, in a recent commentary on the tense situation between Britain and Japan, also stated that although Japan is advancing towards the same goal as the Axis powers, its aim is to exclude European influence in Asia. Foreign Minister Matsuoka Yosuke's statement indicated that although Japan has weakened its own strength due to the war in China, it is also prepared to deal with European countries, but dares not offend the United States. (9th dispatch)</p>
<p>The French-language Geneva Forum, published by Swiss individuals in Geneva, recently commented on the tense relations between Britain and Japan. The article first outlined the changes in Anglo-Japanese relations over the past few months and the restructuring of the Japanese cabinet. It concluded that Japan may be imitating Italy's tactics of containing the British navy in the Mediterranean, but Japan's achievements in the Pacific will not match Italy's achievements in the Mediterranean, because the attitude of the United States is still unclear. Although German newspapers in Geneva have not commented, their headlines implicitly convey this meaning. (9th dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e43">The Soviet Union Issues Government Bonds: The Public Eagerly Subscribes, Reaching Over 9.3 Billion Rubles <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>Moscow (TASS): On July 1st of this year, the Soviet government decided to issue new domestic government bonds worth 8 billion rubles. The main purpose is to use the savings of the Soviet people for large-scale socialist construction and to strengthen national defense. As of July 21st, the bonds had been fully subscribed by the public, reaching a total of 9,310,839,000 rubles, exceeding the planned subscription amount by 1,310,839,000 rubles. Government bonds issued by the Soviet Union occupy an important position in the overall financial structure. Before the Five-Year Plan, government bonds accounted for only 3% of the investment amount, but during the implementation of the First Five-Year Plan, it increased to 11.5%, and the Second Five-Year Plan increased to 16.5%. As for the implementation of the Third Five-Year Plan, it increased to 18.5% in 1938 and 19.5% in 1939. The Soviet people are very enthusiastic about subscribing to government bonds, and they are fully subscribed in a very short period of time. For example, in 1937, the government issued 4 billion rubles of national defense bonds, and the subscription amount reached 4,732 million rubles, exceeding the amount by 932 million rubles. The increase in subscription reflects the improvement in the living standards of the Soviet people. For example, in October 1928, the government's income from government bonds was only 300 million rubles, but by 1939 it had increased to 6.1 billion rubles.</p>

<p>London: 150 German planes flew over the British coast last night, launching a fierce new offensive against Britain. This immediately led to the largest air battle since the start of the war, almost comparable to Germany's "air blitzkrieg" against Britain. In addition to group air raids, German planes, including small teams of aircraft and lone bombers, were bombing various coastal areas of Britain throughout the day. The air battle over the English Channel covered an area of ​​hundreds of square miles. German planes attacked in batches of about 80 planes each, and the British counterattack was also continuous. It is said that the British victory over the English Channel was largely due to the barrage balloon nets around the escort ships. This balloon net is still in its initial trial use. With the German planes obstructed by the balloons, the British air defense soldiers were able to calmly meet the enemy. (9th dispatch via International Telegram)</p>
<p>London: Yesterday, German bombers and motor torpedo boats jointly attacked a British convoy in the English Channel, with intermittent attacks lasting over 14 hours. This air battle was unprecedented in scale and duration off the British coast. At one point, as many as 80 German planes attacked. It is believed here that Junkers dive bombers accounted for one-third of the 53 German planes shot down, and the rest were fighters, but the number of monoplanes and biplanes is still unknown. According to a joint communiqué from the Admiralty and the Air Ministry, enemy motor torpedo boats attacked a British convoy before dawn yesterday morning, sinking and damaging one motor torpedo boat each. Three coastal merchant ships in the convoy were sunk by torpedoes. The air battle began yesterday morning and continued throughout the day. The results of the enemy bombing are not yet known, but several ships were severely damaged, and the extent of the damage cannot be accurately determined. Some survivors and injured have already landed. A large number of dive bombers, protected by single-engine and twin-engine fighters, participated in the attack. Each time they attacked, the British Air Force fighter squadrons fiercely fought back. The details of the enemy's damage are unknown, but it has been confirmed that 53 enemy planes were shot down, and 16 British fighters are currently missing. (9th dispatch via Reuters)</p>
<p>London: According to an Air Ministry communiqué, about 400 German planes participated in the battle over the English Channel yesterday. The British Air Force achieved unprecedented success, shooting down a total of 53 German planes. Therefore, Germany has lost more than one-seventh of the planes used to attack the convoy. However, this air battle was divided into three sections, with each section separated by about one hour. Many German planes refueled and reloaded ammunition at bases in France before rejoining the battle. Therefore, the actual number of planes participating in the battle may be less than 400, and the percentage of German losses should also increase accordingly. (9th dispatch via Reuters)</p>
<p>London: The British Air Force Intelligence Office issued a detailed report on the air battle over the English Channel last night, stating: "Since the air battle along the coast, today has been the day with the greatest losses for the German Air Force. British Hurricane and Spitfire aircraft shot down a total of 53 enemy planes over the English Channel, including 19 Junkers dive bombers and 34 Messerschmitt fighters. 16 British fighters are missing. One Polish pilot shot down an enemy plane on his first mission. The main part of today's air battle was divided into three phases. The first phase was from 9:00 to 9:30 in the morning, when six Junkers dive bombers and three Messerschmitt fighters were shot down by the British Hurricane squadron. The second phase was from 11:30 in the morning to 1:00 in the afternoon. This time, more planes attacked the British convoy than in the first phase. The third phase was from 4:00 to 5:00 in the afternoon, when the German side used about 150 bombers and fighters to launch a final attack on the British convoy. According to British participants, the sky was almost covered by German planes at the time." (9th dispatch via Reuters)</p>
<p>London: According to sources here, the result of the joint attack by German motor torpedo boats and planes on the English Channel convoy yesterday was the sinking of five ships, totaling 5,039 tons. The German claim of sinking 767,000 tons of ships is completely unfounded. Another seven ships in the convoy were damaged, but all have been towed to port. The German motor torpedo boat announced by the Admiralty last night to have been damaged has been sunk by escorting warships. Of the five ships sunk, three were sunk by German motor torpedo boats, but all were small transport ships, totaling about 2,500 tons. The other two were sunk by planes, with a total tonnage of 2,539 tons. As for the seven ships damaged, all were small ships, and only two exceeded 1,000 tons. (9th dispatch via Reuters)</p>
<p>Berlin: Last night, the German military headquarters issued a battle report stating that on Wednesday night, German motor torpedo boat teams attacked enemy escort merchant ships. Although enemy destroyers, patrol boats, and armed merchant ships fired fiercely, an enemy oil tanker (8,000 tons), two ships (about 5,000 tons each), and another small oil tanker were set on fire and destroyed. Our motor torpedo boats all returned to base without injury. Yesterday afternoon, the German Air Force attacked a British convoy in the English Channel, sinking twelve ships with a total weight of 55,000 tons and severely damaging seven others. An air battle then broke out, in which five British planes were shot down and one German plane went missing. Twenty-nine enemy planes were shot down in the air battle yesterday morning, and the German side lost two planes. (9th dispatch via Sea Express)</p>

At the same time, all communication lines between southern France and the German-occupied area have been cut off by order of the German Army High Command. Many of the rubber boats used to attack Britain are very large and can hold 20 people. In addition, there are 120 barges and many small gunboats. Also, the German authorities have evacuated the people from the Ruhr area and the banks of the Rhine River and sent them to the eastern border of France to avoid British bombing.

<p>Rome: Sources say that Italian forces, led by Duke Aosta, have continued to advance towards Berbera, the capital of British Somaliland, after occupying Zeila Port and Hargeisa. The occupation of the entire British Somaliland is only a matter of days. (9th dispatch via United Press)</p>
<p>Cairo: Regarding the war in Somaliland, there has been no other news since the Italian forces were blocked at Zeila Port yesterday. It is generally believed that the Italian forces will find it very difficult to advance towards Berbera, because the route from Zeila along the coast to Berbera can be shelled from the sea. (9th dispatch via Reuters)</p>
<p>London: It was recently announced here by responsible parties that British forces may hold the mountains south of Berbera Port in Somaliland to defend the main port. The mountains are about 35 to 40 miles away from Berbera and provide an excellent defense line against advancing Italian forces. It is said that it would not be a prudent strategy to occupy the undefended Zeila and resist a superior enemy force. The goal of the British forces in the various theaters of war in Africa is not to occupy territory but to defeat the enemy forces. Because the British Navy is tightly defending the Mediterranean Sea, it is not easy for the enemy forces to reinforce. As for where to defeat the enemy forces, it is actually not of great importance. It is said that this will be a war of attrition, and the initial combat power of the British forces is to focus on this point. It is more important to replenish the loss of manpower and machinery, which is far more important than the gain or loss of land. (9th dispatch via Reuters)</p>
<p>Cairo: A communiqué states that the several enemy forces that invaded British Somaliland stopped advancing as expected after occupying Hargeisa and Oodweyne. According to aerial reconnaissance reports, there is little military activity around these locations. The western desert border is calm, but there are still reports of enemy activity, especially motorized transport. The Sudan is generally calm except for an unsuccessful enemy air raid on Atbara. The situation in the Boraiwo area and its east remains normal. There is nothing to report from Kenya and Palestine. According to sources here, although the Red Sea coastline is long, it is now a sea lane for British ships only, with no enemy threat. Unless Italy occupies the Suez Canal and forces the British Navy to withdraw from the Red Sea, the Italian advance into the Gulf of Aden, even if victorious, is not worth mentioning. After the British Air Force bombed another Italian submarine two days ago, only three Italian submarines remain in the Red Sea, and the Italian Navy in the area is far inferior to the British Navy, so they dare not attack merchant ships. It is said that the governments of Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries have formally declared the safety of the pilgrimage route. In other words, there is now no danger to Egyptian ships sailing to pilgrimage sites. According to observers here, the British have blockaded the enemy supply line entering the Red Sea via the Suez Canal. Unless Italy can open this route, the Italian forces stationed in Abyssinia will gradually be eliminated. The Italian invasion of British Somaliland has achieved little success. Even if the remaining land is occupied by Italian forces, it is just an unimportant corner added to the Abyssinia occupied by Italy, and its supply line is still cut off. If the Italian forces begin to advance now, they will suffer from the scorching sun and the lack of water in the desert. Egypt has been concerned about Italian aggression for five years, but now, although the enemy is taking action on the border, the Egyptian people remain calm and ask with a smile whether the invasion has begun. Anglo-Egyptian cooperation is now very close. British and Egyptian military leaders have worked out detailed plans to be implemented in the event of an attack on Egypt. (9th dispatch via Reuters)</p>

<p>Vichy: According to semi-official French sources, the authorities have recently promulgated new decrees to change the administrative organization of French African colonies. French Equatorial Africa (originally divided into three colonies, but merged into one administrative unit since 1934) has become a joint colony. The colony of Mauritania (one of the eight French West Indies colonies) will no longer have a resident governor. The autonomous status of the colony will be retained, but it will be placed under the overall governance of the Governor-General of Senegal. Dakar and its dependencies will also be governed by the Governor-General of Senegal, but administrative matters will be handled by another official. It is said that the above reform is to complete the decree of June 25th to establish unity of command in French West Africa and Central Africa. (9th dispatch via Reuters)</p>

<h3 id="e62">A True Record of the European War (5) - The Reasons for the French Defeat <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>This is a collection of three articles. The first section describes the general mobilization of the French army, written by the French female writer Mrs. Fortescue. The middle section depicts a glimpse of a Parisian train station, penned by the renowned special correspondent for the New York Herald Tribune, Ms. Dorothy Thompson. The final section analyzes the reasons for the French defeat, based on the observations of Mr. Mallory Browne, the general editor of the European branch of the American Christian Science Monitor and former head of its Paris branch, and the conclusions drawn from the reports of various responsible parties. Translated as follows:</p>
<p>Foreigners rarely understand how cruel the Mobilisation Generale of the French army is for the French people. The happiness, tranquility, and serenity of every family is completely destroyed by these words.</p>
<p>In the atmosphere of general mobilization, we only see hundreds of thousands of French soldiers, with full beards and disheveled hair, all exhausted and lost, moving forward with pain; some fall by the roadside, taking off their blood-filled boots. There is also a soldier holding a baby in his arms, staggering along with the column. His wife died a few days before his enlistment, leaving behind this child. There was no time to find a wet nurse, and even if I could find one, he could not afford it. He could only hold this motherless baby, waiting for the opportunity along the way, hoping that compassionate women would adopt it for him until he returned home, if he could survive.</p>
<p>The women of our village stood by the roadside to watch. Their own husbands, fathers, and sons had already been mobilized two days earlier. Were there any of their own flesh and blood among these passing soldiers? Suddenly, a rude middle-aged soldier stepped out of the ranks and ran to a young woman holding a child in her arms. He bluntly asked to kiss the child. Many women began to cry.</p>
<p>Before, after, left and right of these columns, we often saw those "orphaned" dogs, running around, sniffing everywhere, looking for their masters. They were abandoned at home, burst out of the door, still hoping to relive the old dream with their masters.</p>
<p>Amidst this national turmoil, our suffering also began. At first, a general with three stars on his collar asked us to provide accommodation for the officers and soldiers under his command. At the beginning of the war, we always thought that French troops would not be stationed in our homes. Now, hundreds of exhausted soldiers stumble and fall into the courtyard, collapsing against the walls, hoping we will take care of them. But we soon felt that the supplies were really too scarce. Their officers were already housed in the bedrooms, the sofas in the living room, and the camp beds in the hallway. So the workshop, stable, laundry room, and corridors had to be given over to the soldiers. We gathered all the wooden boards and straw from the countryside to lay on the mud and cement floors for them to rest. We also used old cloth and waste bags as mattresses, and carpets and felt were all requisitioned. Many soldiers had not yet received their military blankets (preparing full uniforms for six million troops is indeed a daunting task); later, we found everything that could provide warmth, such as blankets from the bathroom, robes used for washing, and so on, and gave them to them.</p>
<p>From then on, we lived a different life. The neighbor's laundry room became the office of the cavalry captain, and the sound of the typewriter clattered incessantly. The stable became a military barber shop, and soldiers were often inside grooming themselves. French soldiers' bread and wine were placed on the altar of the church, and this sacred place was also occupied by the soldiers. These soldiers were the last to arrive on a rainy night. One of them hesitated, saying, how could he lie down in this sacred place? I said, God wants his sons to be well-fed and warm, and he will surely protect you.</p>
<p>In the kitchen, the soldiers, half-naked, gathered around the stone trough, enjoying rubbing each other's backs. The laundry room was also crowded with them, washing their underwear. I went to these places from time to time, because the soldiers were like lost children and needed to be comforted. They regarded any small favor given to them as a great kindness. For example, hanging a shaving mirror for them, drying their wet clothes, and other trivial things were all highly valued by them and considered unexpected.</p>
<p>They were all willing to work for me. Seeing me picking jasmine flowers every morning, they all volunteered to help. They tied baskets around their waists, walked into the flower lane, and picked flowers with both hands. After picking them, they asked me to give each of them two flowers to send to their wives. They said that they were not allowed to tell their families where they were marching. Now, if they sent jasmine flowers home, their wives would know that they were still safely staying in the beautiful rear.</p>
<p>One morning, I was inhaling the fragrance of verbena and jasmine in the flower garden, feeling so beautiful and intoxicated that I could hardly believe I was still in a world of artillery fire. I saw a strange sight. In the jasmine bushes, a monster with a long nose and huge eyes suddenly appeared, wriggling around. I could hardly breathe until I looked closely and realized that they were soldiers wearing gas masks picking flowers. Their officers had told them to wear gas masks for an hour to practice, and this hour happened to be the time for them to pick jasmine flowers.</p>
<p>I gradually developed affection for the soldiers. They often told us their concerns. The morale was so low, which was not what the lively French should have in times of crisis. Their general told us that the mail had not arrived for a long time, and the soldiers had not received a single letter from home since they went on the expedition. One soldier's wife was about to give birth when he was mobilized; now he did not know whether his wife was alive or dead, or whether the child born was a boy or a girl. Another soldier did not have time to harvest when he left, and only a sixteen-year-old daughter was left at home, living on twenty francs. Another soldier had not cut the grass or planted potatoes when he was mobilized. His elderly parents lived high on the mountain and could not harvest before the snow fell. There were no neighbors, and the mules and vehicles had been requisitioned by the army. The two old people relied on potatoes to get through the winter, and now there was no news. Most of these soldiers came from the fields, with their hearts set on their parents and a small piece of land, because people and land are indispensable to them!</p>
<p>Their officers were kind and asked us if there was any way to reduce the soldiers' worries. Because they huddled together in the workshop and barn at night, with only one candle illuminating many worried faces. There was no coffee shop in our village for them to rest in. Later, we found a tent that had not been requisitioned and set it up in the center of the village. Although it leaked a little, the red and white stripes looked pleasing to the eye. At night, five or six hundred soldiers crowded inside, some playing cards, some writing letters home, and some listening to gramophone records. From six to nine o'clock in the evening, we hired them to serve hot coffee and chocolate.)</p>
<p>When the news came that the soldiers stationed on our mountain were leaving, many of them shed tears. Our address book added many complicated numbers of teams and camps. The soldiers also told me their wives' addresses and asked me to write letters to inform them that their husbands were strong and happy (even if they were not happy, they had to write that way).</p>
<p>They left before dawn. Only a red snake-like line descended the mountain—many red lights behind the heavy trucks carrying these soldiers, gradually going farther and farther, and not knowing where they were going.</p>
<p>They left, but others came, and more were coming, not knowing when it would end.</p>
<p>On the platform of the Paris train station, the soldier and his lover stood face to face, his hand placed under her vest, around her waist. The officer held his lover's arm. The four of them did not say a word.</p>
<p>"The French are the most talkative," but on this crowded platform, there was silence. What was there to say that had not already been said? What was there to encounter that had not already been expected?</p>
<p>The soldiers in the Paris train station were all wearing uniforms, but they were not the same. People of the backward era, why are your faces so different? You are so uneven, your individualistic colors are so strong, you have the arrogance of hermits, you have the wisdom of the old and worldly, you have the mouths of rural hedonists, you love books and women; you are now going to meet the risen.</p>
<p>The French are a backward nation. The entire population of France, forty-two million, is now facing Germany with a population of eighty million.</p>
<p>The soldier put his young daughter on his shoulders. He stroked her hair—his individualism! The daughter's hair, a rare French child. ,</p>
<p>The birth rate of the French population is very stable, and everyone practices small familyism. A person's ability, if he can raise and educate several children, he will have several children. If it is a smart child, he will send him to a public high school to study.</p>
<p>No one laughed, no one sang, and there were no military songs at the train station.</p>
<p>A woman in black clothes held a child in her arms. Tears flowed down her face. Her lips trembled slightly. A nine-year-old boy stood beside his parents, who said a few quick and low words. He cried very sadly, but without a sound.</p>
<p>The whistle sounded loudly. The officer kissed his lover's cheek, and the soldier kissed his mistress one more time! In that moment of life and death, no one wanted to care about other people's business. No one talked about German soldiers or the war. No flags, no salutes... and no goodbyes. They pushed away and squeezed into the car. They looked out from the window—countless different faces. Now they finally smiled, comfortingly and knowingly. The women all stood together, but everyone was alone, everyone was surrounded by loneliness, and everyone shed tears alone.</p>
<p>The train started. Men waved their hands, women waved their hands, crying, laughing.</p>
<p>No one shouted "Long live France"! France is gone from here!</p>

<p>(Shaoguan Dispatch) Since the National Sun Yat-sen University moved to Yunnan Province, it has affected the studies of young people in South China. The Guangdong Provincial authorities have long been requesting its return, and because of the lack of materials and high cost of living in Yunnan Province, it is difficult for students to support themselves. It has now been decided to move back to Guangdong. It was initially planned to move back only three colleges, with four colleges remaining in Yunnan. After further consultations with various parties, the final decision has now been made for all seven colleges to move back to northern Guangdong. Acting President Xu Chongqing arrived in Shaoguan on the 29th of last month with several professors to negotiate the relocation with the Provincial Government's Department of Education.

<h3 id="e74">Total Mobilization of Concession Forces: Preparations Implemented Yesterday; Strict Curfew and Restrictions on Nighttime Activities; Non-Essential Roads All Blocked <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>"The third anniversary of the August 13th Songhu Resistance War is imminent. The police authorities in both concessions believe that the situation in Shanghai is becoming increasingly complex. To prevent those with ulterior motives from taking advantage of the situation, this year's martial law situation is stricter and more tense than in the past two years. Special preparations began yesterday. Although there was heavy rain the night before, with water depths reaching knee-deep on various roads, the Municipal Council followed the planned schedule and worked overnight to set up obstacles and barbed wire on various roads, wading through water without slackening due to the accumulated water. The curfew was strictly enforced last night. Regardless of Chinese or foreign pedestrians, they were not allowed to pass at that time. According to a spokesperson for the police department, residents of this port should note that during this period of preparation, all bars, dance halls, and other entertainment venues in the concession will be closed at 12:30 AM. Those returning to the Public Concession from the areas built beyond the boundaries will be stopped and taken to the nearest police station to spend the night. It is reported that a detachment of the Japanese Marine Corps will hold exercises in Zhabei on the 13th to commemorate the third anniversary of August 13th.</p>
<p>Stopping Entertainment and Commemorating Calmly</p>
<p>All sectors of the city, considering the current environment in Shanghai and the upcoming third anniversary of the great Shanghai War, will not engage in extravagant commemorative ceremonies. However, to express the firm belief in resistance and to mourn the fallen soldiers and compatriots, it has been decided that all banquets, entertainment, and meat consumption will be suspended on that day, and everyone will silently mourn in their respective positions at noon. At the same time, efforts will be intensified to promote the donation and relief movement to take resolute action and commemorate calmly.</p>
<p>All Police Officers and Defense Forces Mobilized</p>
<p>In order to strengthen control and maintain the peace and security of the concession, the city's police authorities began special preparations yesterday morning. All police officers and special patrols were mobilized and deployed at key intersections, and patrolled in batches. The International Settlement Volunteer Corps and the French defense forces were not only stationed at key traffic points but also formed small teams of three to five people to patrol their respective defense zones. The city's fortifications were also fully manned by British and French troops, creating a tense atmosphere. At the same time, the two concessions tightened the curfew and implemented measures to strictly control and treat those resisting arrest. These strict preparations will be implemented daily until the morning of the 14th of this month.</p>
<p>Side Streets and Alleys All Blocked</p>
<p>All non-essential roads in the city were completely blocked by the police authorities starting at 5 AM yesterday. It is estimated that there are more than 20 places on both sides of Avenue Edward VII, from east to west, that are blocked by barbed wire. Only a few places, such as the Bund, Henan Road, Fujian Road, Dongxinqiao, Yu Qiaqing Road, Ma Huo Road, Tongfu Road, Seymour Road, and Shanzhong Road, have gaps left for vehicles and pedestrians to enter and exit. The side streets and alleys of the two concessions were also blocked at the same time. Six or seven Chinese and Western detectives were stationed on both sides of each road with only gaps, strictly inspecting the vehicles and pedestrians passing through. The preparations near the Great World were particularly strict, with a dense network of military police and armored vehicles patrolling back and forth from time to time. Yesterday, a shed was also built in the courtyard of the side door of the Shanghai Epidemic Prevention Hospital on Yu Qiaqing Road, where a police car was parked and more than a dozen British soldiers took turns resting inside.</p>
<p>Preparations Along the Suzhou Creek</p>
<p>The bridges in the central concession leading to the north of the Suzhou Creek also took precautionary measures yesterday. Two barbed wire fences were added to the middle of the Tianhou Palace, Fujian Road, Zhejiang Road, and Tibet Road bridges, leaving extremely small passages for vehicles and pedestrians to enter and exit. Although the Sichuan Road, Waibaidu, and Libaidu bridges could still be freely passed yesterday, the number of patrol officers in the concession had been greatly increased, and the inspection of pedestrians was strict. As for the iron gates at the junction of Zhabei, they were still open as before, but the number of British soldiers guarding the iron gate at the end of North Henan Road had increased from one to two, and several patrol officers had been dispatched to assist. The Japanese soldiers guarding the posts outside the border had also increased, and their surveillance of pedestrians was quite strict. As for the weaving doors on Shanxi Road, Tibet Road, and the border of the French Concession, there were no abnormalities except that they had all been strengthened.</p>

<p>The Shanghai-Fang routes are smooth and worry-free. The Taikoo Qiongzhou Wheel sailed from Shanghai to Fang yesterday morning, also going to Hong Kong, Guangzhou Bay, and Haikou. This morning, the Jiaying Wheel went to Siam, also stopping at Shantou, Hong Kong, and Saigon in Vietnam. Ships from Shanghai to Fang</p>
<p>Next week's schedule</p>
<p>It is estimated that the Jardine Matheson Taishun Wheel will arrive in Shanghai from Hong Kong next week and is scheduled to arrive on Monday. It is scheduled to sail from Shanghai to Haiphong, also stopping in Hong Kong, on Thursday (15th). The Taikoo Company Guangdong Wheel is scheduled to sail from Shanghai to Haiphong next Saturday (17th), also stopping in Hong Kong, Guangzhou Bay, and Haikou. The ship is expected to arrive between the 15th and 16th. The two companies' Shanghai-Fang shipping lines were originally scheduled for every Tuesday</p>
<p>New routes</p>
<p>Recently, due to the newly opened routes from Shanghai directly to Singapore and Luzon, the voyage is long, and all ships are insufficient to allocate, so only one flight is changed per week. If there are more ships, two flights will still be opened. It is also heard that Yue Du Deguzhong will telegraph the French Consulate in Kunming to allow the release of goods stored in Haiphong warehouses, which will help to restore future freight transportation.</p>
<p>French ships sail directly</p>
<p>The French Post Steamship Company has recently tried to resume shipping between Shanghai and Haiphong. However, the company's French ships plan to sail directly between Shanghai and Haiphong without passing through Hong Kong. According to the company's statement to Pingming News Agency yesterday, the company's Sikiang Wheel (transliteration of "West River" without a Chinese name) weighed 7,000 tons and arrived in Shanghai on the 5th of this month with more than 50,000 bags of rice from Saigon. The ship loaded goods and passengers as usual in Shanghai and sailed to Kobe, Japan, the day before yesterday (8th). It is expected to return to Shanghai on the 16th and will load passengers and cargo in Shanghai on the 18th to sail directly to Haiphong. This round is the first to try to restore the French Far East shipping. If it goes well, other ships will also resume their voyages one after another.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Mine Laying Area</p>
<p>Shuiying Merchant Shipping Industry received a notice from Hong Kong stating that the Hong Kong Maritime Administration recently announced that the Hong Kong to Shanghai route includes (1) Dangerous areas in typhoon shelters, including Tangshan Port, Sandu Ao, Laiyuan Bay, Sansha Bay, Nanwan Port, and Xinghua Bay; (2) Dangerous areas for drifting mines, including Haitan Gorge (between Aidao Reef and Qi Island) to Shuangchuzui Island; (3) Biwan Port is a potentially dangerous area. All of these areas cannot guarantee safety. All navigators must consider the possibility of mine areas and floating mines and climate changes before freely deciding to navigate.</p>
<p>Shantou Undergoes Wheel Inspection</p>
<p>Recently, all ships sailing to Shantou have been subject to strict inspections by the Japanese authorities. Even trivial items are often considered "evidence of crime," and the companies to which the ships belong are responsible. Therefore, the British Taikoo Company issued a notice yesterday stating, "All passengers taking the bus to Shantou at 7:00 AM on the 10th must send all luggage items to the ship after 6:00 PM on the 9th and must be subject to strict inspection by the company." Passengers going to Shantou feel more and more inconvenienced.</p>
<h3 id="e76">Coal, Firewood, and Food Prices All Decline: Optimistic Expectations for This Winter's Commodity Prices; Sufficient Stockpiles of Rice and Wheat in Shanghai <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>The Yulin West News reported that an official from the Municipal Council's Price Survey Office said yesterday (August 8) that the prices of coal, firewood, food, and other items in this city have an optimistic outlook for this winter and there is no risk of the soaring prices of last year. The situation of coal has improved significantly. In the past two months, coal prices have fallen. The price of hard coal has fallen by 5%, the price of high-quality household coal has fallen by 2%, the price of kitchen coal has fallen by 11%, the price of firewood has fallen by 14%, and the price of charcoal has also fallen by nearly 2%. Coal is available for purchase in some locations at a lower price and is expected to continue to fall.</p>
<p>User Storage Promotes Rising Prices</p>
<p>Coal manipulators did not sell out when coal prices were extremely high, so the current coal situation has improved compared to the previous long period of time. However, citizens should not store coal for winter needs, as this move will allow illegal profiteers to take advantage of the opportunity, resulting in higher coal prices.</p>
<p>This Winter's Commodity Prices Will Definitely Be Reduced</p>
<p>If nothing unexpected happens, commodity prices this winter will be much lower than last winter. Currently, the city has enough coal to meet the needs of five or six months. The Municipal Council has conducted extensive surveys on the coal situation. Although the coal wholesalers have not guaranteed to the bureau that coal prices will not rise this winter, it can be seen from the general attitude of coal merchants on this issue that there is absolutely no reason for concern about the coal situation.</p>
<p>Food Stockpiles Are Also Very Sufficient</p>
<p>The actual selling price of coal is not much lower than last year, but considering the recent surge in freight and insurance costs, coal sales have actually fallen sharply. The Price Survey Office will soon publish a detailed report on various commodity prices. As for food stockpiles, they are also sufficient. Each 49-pound bag of flour sells for 15 yuan at the factory, and the profit from retail sales in the mainland is increasing.</p>
<p>Market Prices of Flour and Wheat Continue to Fall</p>
<p>The Dalu News also reported that, according to reliable sources, market prices of flour and wheat have continued to fall recently. The flour shortage crisis that occurred in this city several weeks ago no longer exists. After negotiations between the Municipal Council and the Japanese authorities here, the restrictions on the surrounding areas of this city have been lifted, and a sufficient amount of wheat has been transported in. The stockpile is sufficient for at least three months. Yesterday's market price of flour was 15 yuan per bag, and it is expected to continue to fall soon. Wheat sells for 19 to 20 yuan per dan, a drop of two to three yuan compared to before.</p>
<p>The City's Rice Stockpiles Are Increasing Daily</p>
<p>The bottom of the city's rice warehouses is significantly higher than in June. According to accurate surveys, the stockpiles in each rice warehouse reach more than 800,000 bags, each bag containing one stone and two and a half dou, reaching more than 1 million stones. Moreover, current daily usage has decreased to 9,000 bags, which is enough for three months. However, the rice price still rises frequently. There are no more than a few points, (1) The international and domestic ship routes are often interrupted, and people seem difficult to stabilize and the one holding the goods are not willing to easily trade; (2) After revising the commercial exchange rate, the black market for foreign exchange tends to tighten and the prices of foreign rice are slightly higher; (3) Activity of the external speculator and the rice industry insider private doing secretly trades makes the rightful rice merchant unable to buy and sell; (4) the cheap rice is temporarily suspended and the unscrupulous rice merchants are also taking the opportunity to do evil,</p>

<p>The Changde Wheel of the Italian merchant Rocco Chi Shipping Company, previously managed by the manager of Jufeng Customs Brokerage, traveled on the Shanghai-Ningbo route. After the Japanese navy announced the blockade of the Zhejiang-Fujian coast in the middle of last month, the wheel was grounded in Shanghai. Recently, it was rented by a Mr. Yang and traveled on the Gu'aotou route, with cargo loaded by Tongli Gong Customs Brokerage. It exited on the morning of the 7th and headed to Gu'aotou. Because the ship was small, it went to the coast for safety reasons so it passed through Dahe ocean in Zhejiang and walked from the back door inside of the Xihoumen Island. Unexpectedly, it mistakenly entered the Japanese naval cordon and was detained. The Japanese navy boarded the ship for inspection, which was generally not a problem and released after explanation. According to another message, it was also heard that the Fusheng small wheel, which was sailing to Songmen, was also detained and searched by the Japanese navy after the Changde Wheel shipowner negotiated. It is not clear what is happening now. The German merchant Far East Company Hanashiou has also cleared customs and will soon be sailing in Oujiang. There is a rumor that the Moufu Wheel will open to Wenzhou next week.</p>

<p>Around 9 AM yesterday morning, another kidnapping case occurred within the Public Concession. The victim was Wang Quji, Director of the Xinhua Chemical Dyeing and Weaving Factory. According to details obtained by a reporter from the Pingming News Agency:</p>
<p>Abducted Midway While Going to the Factory for Work</p>
<p>Wang Ji is 40 years old, a native of Suzhou, residing at No. 3, Xi'ai Village, Xi'aihams Road, French Concession. He currently serves as the Director and Engineer of the Xinhua Chemical Dyeing and Weaving Factory. The factory is located at No. 50 Xingjia Po Road, with a distribution office at No. 30, Lane 531, Henan Road.

Yesterday morning at 8:40 AM, Wang left his residence by car to go to the factory for work. Four bandits were seen loitering near the factory on Xingjia Po Road. Upon seeing Wang's car approaching, the bandits each drew handguns, blocking the car's progress. They then opened the car door, forbade any outcry, and forced the chauffeur to leave the car.

<p>A fire broke out at the Gong Hexiang Tobacco and Paper Shop at No. 130 Zhengjia Muqiao Street, French Concession, yesterday at 11:00 AM. The apprentice, Dong Shenhao (14 years old, from Ningbo), was instructed to fetch firewood from the third-floor attic to prepare lunch. Unexpectedly, Dong was careless and accidentally knocked over a kerosene can, causing the kerosene to spill and flow across the floor. It dripped through the floorboards into the coal stove flames where a tenant on the second floor was cooking, causing the flames to explode and start a fire. At this time, the tenants living in the third-floor pavilion, Liu Zhixiang (30 years old, from Luodian) and his concubine Liu Wangshi (31 years old, from Guangdong), his mother-in-law Chen Zhushi (53 years old, from Luodian), and the tenants living on the second floor, Fan Hongda (33 years old, from Ningbo), Fan Huashi (27 years old), and their four-year-old daughter Fan Shanzhu (held by her mother Huashi), heard the alarm and panicked. They recklessly chose to jump from the windows of the second and third floors to escape, all suffering injuries and head wounds. Arriving and pouring water to extinguish the fire prevented a major disaster, only causing a false alarm with no damage. Injured were one man and three women. Ms. Fan and Chen Zhushi, due to more severe injuries, died successively after 3 PM. The hospital notified the police, who sent the bodies to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall for examination, awaiting a report today.</p>

<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw HSBC's posted rates unchanged. The unofficial market for British and American exchange rates was erratic. The afternoon trend was influenced by rumors, with both positive and negative reports causing significant stimulation. Speculators entered and exited repeatedly, with prices fluctuating from loose to tight. The spread remained calm. Although Sassoon initially aggressively bid, Chinese merchants and laymen were willing to supply. The US exchange rate fluctuated between 5.53125 and 5.5625 yuan. The forward market initially loosened to 3 shillings 75 pence, with the US exchange rate at 5.593+75 yuan. Ultimately, due to rumors that the Japanese were demanding the withdrawal of British troops stationed in Shanghai, a sudden buying frenzy occurred, and the US exchange rate tightened again to 5.53125 yuan. The closing price for British gold was 3 shillings 734375 pence, an increase of 0.015625 compared to the previous day. The US rate was unchanged. The futures market was similar.</p>
<p>Sassoon's Buying Was Quite Strong</p>
<p>Initially, the London price was close, falling 125 yuan. The New York silver price was unchanged. The London gold price was stable. The British exchange rate against the US dollar was unchanged, and against Shanghai, it was also flat. The US dollar fell two-thirds against the pound, a small six points against Shanghai, and there was no market against the franc. The central posted rates for various currencies remained the same. Banks opened in the morning with a spot selling price of 3 shillings 71875 pence for British gold and 5.5625 yuan for the US dollar, with the British rate flat and the US rate 0.03125 yuan higher than the previous day's closing price. However, after the opening, Sassoon's appetite was strong, and the market was stable. Sassoon bought US dollars for August delivery at a low price of 5.5625 yuan. The HSBC posted rate remained unchanged, and the silver balance tax also showed no increase or decrease. Although speculators came to the market to sell, there were always those willing to buy. Therefore, the trend was slightly soft. Speculators sold to others for August delivery at a US dollar price of 5.5625 yuan. The September US dollar was quoted at 5.5 yuan. Foreign and Chinese firms also traded the September US dollar at 5.5 yuan. Later, as transactions thinned, speculators continued to sell slightly, and China Bank absorbed some September contracts, opening at 5.53125 yuan. By noon, the market remained calm, and the result was 3 shillings 734375 pence for British gold and 5.5625 yuan for the US dollar, an increase of 0.015625 for British gold and unchanged for the US dollar compared to the morning opening.</p>

Initially, speculators leaned towards selling, selling to Mitsui, a Japanese firm, for August delivery at 5.59375 yuan. The current shilling was quoted at a strong 3 shillings 75 pence. Later, Japanese firms and others came to buy, and the market softened again, buying US dollars for August delivery at 5.65625 yuan.

<h3 id="e97">Conflicting Positive and Negative News - Gold Market Price Fluctuations <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot gold market was fluctuating, with prices unsteady. It closed flat overall but suddenly soared before the evening closing, due to the sudden tightening of foreign exchange rates and widespread rumors that the Japanese demanded the withdrawal of British troops stationed in Shanghai. This greatly stirred the hearts of all parties. Initially, continuing the weakness of the previous day, the exchange market was slightly tight, with more sellers than buyers. Due to some negative news circulating in the forward market, prices fell sharply. However, prices recovered somewhat at the closing. The morning opening was 5,680 yuan, and initially, gold shops sold to banks, lowering the price to 5,650 yuan. However, soon after, short sellers from money exchanges continued to cover, and banks and others entered, raising the price to 5,705 yuan. Later, due to gold shops buying and scattered buyers selling, it stabilized at 5,686 yuan at closing. The afternoon started quiet, with prices remaining unchanged. Suddenly, rumors spread, and people panicked, causing a significant selling pressure. Prices fell to a low of 5,630 yuan. However, ultimately, the rumors proved false, and positive sentiment suddenly appeared. The exchange market tightened abruptly, rising to 5,685 yuan at closing. Although it still fell 33 yuan, after the closing, it soared to 720 yuan with no sellers. The total daily trading volume was approximately 3,000 taels, which was still active. The initial price of gold jewelry was 10 yuan higher, and in the evening, it rose by 10 yuan. Customs gold remained flat.</p>
<p>Spot Market Suddenly Active Before Closing</p>
<p>From the morning, the price per bar (ten taels) initially dropped by 38 yuan due to weak sentiment. Gold shops sold 20 taels to banks for 5,680 yuan. Because a certain bank and a gold shop were mutually selling and buying, it dropped again by 32 yuan. Gold shops sold 30 taels to money exchanges for 5,650 yuan. Soon after, a certain bank suddenly came in to buy, and money exchanges covered their short positions at low prices. The potential trend was strong for a time, reaching the 5,700 yuan mark. Gold shops bought 30 taels from securities firms, raising the price to 5,705 yuan. Later, with fewer buyers, the price became unsustainable, and securities firms sold a lot, while leveraged buyers closed their positions to limit losses, causing the price to fall back to 5,670 yuan. At noon, banks came to buy, pulling the price up by more than ten yuan. Gold shops traded ten taels for 5,686 yuan, marking the noon closing price. The market opened relatively flat in the afternoon. Gold shops sold ten taels to banks, still for 5,686 yuan. Subsequently, securities firms absorbed the market, but there were many limited-price sellers at this time, so the price only rose by four yuan. Securities firms bought 50 taels from banks and others, raising the price to 5,690 yuan. Suddenly, a small money shop aggressively sold, and the market turned downwards. Soon after, news spread that someone had been assassinated, and reports from Hong Kong indicated a drop in gold prices, triggering significant selling. The price dropped to a low of 5,630 yuan, and the trading volume was quite high. Fewer sellers entered later, and banks bought at low prices, so the potential trend stabilized. Unexpectedly, at that time, there were rumors that British troops stationed in Shanghai and Tianjin were withdrawing to Hong Kong. Speculators considered this positive news, and the trend changed suddenly, turning to buying. A certain gold shop aggressively bought, and by the evening closing, the price had risen to 5,685 yuan, a drop of 33 yuan compared to the previous day. After the closing, the market was very strong, and securities firms continued to buy. The US dollar for this month was offered at 5.5 yuan, but it was difficult to close the deal. Finally, the asking price reached 5,720 yuan, with no sellers. The total fluctuation throughout the day (excluding off-market trading) was 75 yuan. The selling price of gold shops' own brand gold was tens of yuan higher than the spot market price, while the buying price was reduced by 30 yuan. The current standard gold was more than 50 yuan lower than the posted gold price, and few transactions were made.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Drops and Then Recovers</p>
<p>The initial price of gold jewelry per tael at large firms was still 590 yuan. At 9:40 AM, it was raised by ten yuan, and in the evening, the spot gold price had returned to the 5,700 yuan mark. Therefore, the posted price at large firms was changed to 590 yuan. The new firms had the same price as above. The buying price was reduced by about 30 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday's unofficial securities market saw Government Bond A continue to weaken due to unstable leveraged positions on the last day of rights for Joint Bond, while other bonds had gradually recovered. Government Bond E showed the strongest rebound, indicating that the debt market was hurt by the unloading of leveraged positions. Government Bond A had relatively more transactions yesterday. Those with strong financial resources absorbed the market at low prices to secure the right to win the lottery, while those with leveraged positions had no choice but to sell at this last moment. The weakness of Government Bond A was based on this. Xinfu continued to buy Government Bond C. Gongmao, Jiji, and Lianyi mostly bought Government Bond E. Wanchang, Jiufu, and Lemao sold Government Bond A, which was bought by Kang Hengfu and others. Under balanced market conditions, the market gradually tightened.

<h3 id="e103">Foodstuffs A Time of Worry Approaches for Speculative Rice Merchants; Foreign Rice Arrives in a Steady Stream, Though the People's Food Supply Has Not Yet Eliminated Difficulties, the Near Future Holds a Turn for the Better <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>The news that the Norwegian merchant ship "Foch" had imported over 20,000 bags of foreign rice directly from Saigon the day before yesterday has already been reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that the ship was chartered by the Shanghai Timber and Coal Company at 70 Sichuan Road. The foreign rice loaded from Saigon on this occasion amounts to more than this number, totaling 32,324 bags. Furthermore, the Swire Company's "Yuezhou" arrived the evening before yesterday, transporting 1,159 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, and docked at its own wharf in Pudong for unloading. It is also learned that the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's "Dapu" and the manager Panama's "Essi" had previously transported rice from Saigon to Shanghai and have already completed unloading. The two ships left Shanghai the day before yesterday to continue loading rice in Saigon for Shanghai. Therefore, the source of foreign rice in this city is very abundant, and there is no fear of shortage but rather of oversupply. In addition, early season Indica rice has already entered the market, and after several days of heavy rain, the weather has cleared up again, which is very beneficial to farmland. Rice merchants who hoard rice only know that the days when they can harm the people's food supply are numbered, and their failure is imminent. (Zu)</p>
<p>Since the newspaper began announcing the exact amount of foreign rice arriving in Shanghai daily, it has often left treacherous merchants who speculate and hoard without a basis for their actions. Yesterday morning, the rice market still tried to maintain its position, but the news of abundant reserves and a continuous supply spread throughout the market, and buyers repeatedly adopted a wait-and-see attitude. At the same time, floating hoarders and scattered households were considering transactions, fearing that stirring up trouble would only lead to difficulties in selling off their massive amounts of goods in the future, and they were thinking of releasing some stocks to minimize losses. Once a downward trend took hold, with the rapid changes in recent times, people felt very uncertain, and many sought to sell, causing prices to plummet all the way down. The closing price was a steep one and a half yuan lower than the previous market, with No. 5 Saigon at 58.5 yuan and 58 yuan.</p>
<p>In other news, there were new hoarders from inland provinces inquiring about foreign rice in the morning, and their confidence was strong, trying to raise the price by 30 to 50 cents. However, with the transshipment gangs not continuing to operate, no further loading was done during the day. While Yinghua's No. 2 Siam rice was pulled up in the early market, opening at 64 yuan, the same price as the previous day's opening, No. 2 Saigon was also sold at the same price. However, with no real sales advisors, many hoarders also adopted a wait-and-see attitude. Floating profit-takers then sought to sell one after another, and the selling price of Saigon Siam was immediately suppressed by half a yuan, both opening at 63.5 yuan, slightly lower than the previous market. The closing situation was still relatively weak, with only over 100 tons traded. Currently, foreign rice failed to rise in the early market and was pushed down by half a yuan in the later market. With abundant reserves and a continuous influx of new arrivals, the market lacks a good outlook. Moreover, after new early season Indica rice from various regions enters the market, if large quantities arrive in Shanghai, it will also be a strong competitor to foreign rice. Yesterday, over 2,000 bags of Anhui Indica rice arrived, and it is possible that a steady stream will arrive in Shanghai in the future.</p>
<p>There were no arrivals of glutinous rice, and people's confidence remained strong. Although sales were relatively slow, the market did not change, presenting a stable situation. Special-grade Golden Lishui remained at 62-63 yuan, while Changdan goods ranged from 61 to 58-59 yuan. However, Hong Kong glutinous rice softened along with foreign rice, opening at 60 yuan and then dropping to 57-58 yuan.</p>
<p>Only 500 to 600 bags of thick and thin Japonica rice and other domestic rice arrived. It is heard that off-market deals saw general customers offering 67-68 yuan for special-grade Qinggeng rice from Natton, 66-67 yuan for Wuxi Qinggeng rice, 64-65 yuan for Changzhou Sukun Geng rice, and 62-63 yuan for lower grades. There was a lack of thin rice on the market, and Nanhang's original package of early season paddy rice was selling at 65 yuan, with specially fresh grain at 62.5 yuan, 62 yuan, and lower grades at 60 yuan.</p>
<p>New Japonica rice from Zhoupu arrived in a continuous but small amount, only over 20 dan, and sales were still good, with the price holding at the original opening price of 63 yuan.</p>

This is because the market atmosphere has changed amid the rising prices of goods in recent days. Japanese factory flour is even favored by gangs from Beiyang. Therefore, the price of Phoenix brand flour is gradually rising, from 14.2 yuan this month to 14.5 yuan. The initial price for September was 14.4 yuan, which then quickly rose to 60 cents, a further increase of 20 to 30 cents. Foreign flour is also becoming tight at the same time. The Battery brand and Double Eagle brand from Weida Foreign Company both require 16.2 yuan, while the price of Double Lion brand from inland provinces is 14.6-7 yuan. Local customers traded a total of over 10,000 bags.</p>
<p>The wheat market remains sluggish as before, and neither Japanese nor Chinese factories have a strong desire to purchase. Japanese factories have abundant reserves, while Chinese factories face difficulties in importing from outside the region. However, sellers have reduced their arrivals and are reluctant to sell easily due to rising production prices. As a result, the market remains stagnant, with only a few local customers and small households inquiring.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Yarn and Cotton; Too Many Chips; The Yarn Market is Suppressed; Double Horse Approaches the 1,000 Yuan Mark <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market has turned downward, with a slight downward trend. This is because current sales are lacking, and many profit-takers are closing out positions, loosening the market and causing prices to fall again. However, as prices have fallen, there are also buyers coming in, so in this situation, the yarn market is still in a state of fluctuation. However, the number of chips seems to be increasing, and once there is a change, the floating longs quickly sell out. The ranks of the bulls are not as solid as they used to be.</p>
<p>The opening price of current yarn in the morning was stable due to the slight increase in foreign exchange, and the asking price for 20-count Double Horse was 1,007 yuan. Soon after, there were few buyers in the market, and the market gradually shrank, falling from 1,008 yuan to 991 yuan. By the time of closing, the bulls had slightly increased their purchases, and the market situation stabilized somewhat, but actual transactions were very few. According to statistics, 1,995 bales were traded in half a day, and the price of 20-count Double Horse fell by 23 yuan. Today, 140 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Tianjin, 250 bales to Yantai, 95 bales to Hong Kong, and 40 bales to [...]. The amounts purchased by various gangs are listed below:</p>
<h3 id="e106">Yarn Prices Fall; The Cotton Market Suddenly Becomes Stagnant <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>The current cotton business has been unusually active in the past two days, with demand from both Chinese and foreign factories. Therefore, prices have risen accordingly. However, all parties are very tight on cash and mostly require transactions with silver to be paid in one or two months. Today, the situation for current cotton outside is not as lively as yesterday. Because yarn prices have fallen again, the factories' intentions have slowed down slightly, and the prices of various cottons are slightly weaker than yesterday.</p>
<p>In other news, the market price of foreign cotton, the New York cotton market, opened quite strong in the morning. Later, due to purchases by speculators and improved spot transactions, some shorts also covered their positions in Shanghai. As a result, closing prices were 8 to 10 points higher than yesterday. The Indian cotton market rose more than one rupee yesterday, including forecasts.</p>
<p>Yesterday, foreign cotton transactions in Shanghai were also very sluggish due to the small rebound in yarn prices. However, the tightening of exchange rates had very little impact on the cotton market. The industry's sentiment is very high, mainly because the market's reserves are not abundant. The war risk insurance for Brazilian cotton shipped to Shanghai has risen to 4%, equivalent to about 10 yuan per dan.</p>

<p>The River God, also known as the Great King General, is recorded in sacrificial texts as enjoying watching plays. Therefore, from north of the Qing and Huai Rivers, local officials, knowing that the River God is arriving, hire famous troupes to perform plays, day and night without interruption, until the god leaves. At the beginning of the month, four Great Kings were said to be traveling from Henan to Tianjin on Jiangbei grain boats. Plays were performed on the 9th and subsequent days. Ten more arrived successively, with two stages performing together for twelve days, the inner stage in the sleeping quarters for the god to hear under the Peace Platform, and the outer stage for anyone to watch. Old men, children, and beautifully dressed women crowded together, almost filling the space. Inside and outside the temple gate, feet crossed back and forth, wearing down the threshold. On the 13th, the Great Kings gradually departed, leaving only four. The plays were stopped that day, but the sound of gongs resumed at midday, reportedly to welcome three more. The river water, which had already receded significantly, rose more than a foot again. Local officials, upon hearing the news, rushed to offer incense. On the 14th, the Taiheng Troupe was rehired to perform on the inner stage. On the 15th, the Three Officials Temple, a few steps away from the Great King Temple, also hired the Ruyi Troupe to perform plays to worship the gods, competing with the Taiheng Troupe. In addition to the plays, there were lantern bridges on the shore and dragon boats on the water, creating a scenic spectacle. Bridges spanned the river like rows of geese teeth, with the light of lanterns vying with the stars. Boats painted with dragons and scales, their oars stirring the wind and clouds. The whole city was emptied, causing a great commotion. And in the vicinity of Guanxia, there were also various performances such as women's acrobatics, horse racing, and rope walking, almost overwhelming the spectators like being on a mountain path in Shanyin, unable to take it all in. It was truly a time to enjoy oneself and embellish the peaceful era.</p>

<h3 id="e108">My View of Life <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>— Xin Qing</p>
<p>Strangely enough, I am a young man who is not yet eighteen years old, and I have not yet defined my own view of life. The environment has shaped me into a melancholy and taciturn, but not pessimistic, person. I constantly find myself changing; the me of the previous moment is very different from the me of this moment, and the me of this year is no longer the me of last year.</p>
<p>Usually, I use my eyes to observe the actions and conversations of others. I want to express my own ideas when others are talking enthusiastically, but I always let my full emotions flow away due to the indifference of others, leaving me without the courage to speak. This has further made me more silent in my daily life. At the same time, I have found that people who cannot speak are rarely welcomed, especially me, with such a personality. I feel very lonely, as desolate and bleak as walking in a desert. From time to time, I have some tragic thoughts, but they drift away like floating clouds.</p>
<p>However, I understand how small and pathetic life is. I am constantly pursuing truth, and I understand what a truly noble life means. I am always thinking about how to sacrifice myself. Once, a large moth landed on the window frame and someone saw it and shouted. I disregarded everything, and with my fingers trembling with excitement, I gently picked it up and released it outside the window. What is "fear"? A person who disregards their own life will not care about what is called fear. I can only present myself to the public; this is the purpose of my life in this world. Family members wrote to ask me what I planned to study in the future, and I said, "As long as living is meaningful, I can do it even if it means risking my life." I never thought about what I should study. I remember shedding many tears at the time. I should learn to be a brave person, a fighter who is unafraid of death like those who fight bloodily against aggression, not for themselves, but for countless people who refuse to submit.</p>
<p>I have turned all external stimuli into a calm attitude. Money, beauty, and reputation all seem to be worthless. People see me as a silent guy. Some say that someone is taciturn, and others say that someone has quirks. I did not guess the emotions behind all these judgments, whether they were well-intentioned or contained sharp barbs. I use a firm belief to overcome everything, which is, "I want to move one step ahead in my career, and other issues can be ignored." This is the one great goal I have had since birth. I feel that being able to live an austere life can really give me a lot of courage, encouragement, and impetus, allowing me to be unafraid of setbacks. It is inevitable that it sometimes brings trouble and fluctuating wavering, and I use it to strengthen and affirm my wavering will. Therefore, I have the courage to live on. I feel that life is a necessity in the process of struggle. We have to live, so we also have to taste the bitter, spicy, sour, and stimulating flavors of life and prepare the conditions necessary for all struggles. I also feel that the true meaning of life is obtained through what kind of method; it is not unearned, something that can be obtained with a wave of the hand; nor is it the beautiful cobweb woven in the minds of idealists, easily destroyed by the wind, like a soap bubble bursting. It is not like gamblers who shout and roll dice, betting everything in the hope of exchanging a small amount of money for a pile of shiny gold; nor is it the means adopted by general opportunists. This is the noblest, most honorable, upright, and admirable method of obtaining something, exchanged for life, precious blood, sweat, and effort. Just as we know, the joy of harvesting grain is exchanged for labor. This is the joy of those who harvest after paying a corresponding price, a true joy.</p>
<p>At the same time, it also awakens us that the survival of our motherland is the same principle. We can only continue to fight with an indestructible force to achieve our ideal life.</p>
<p>I hope that the saying "Life is a training for battle" will be conveyed to everyone, whether old or young; and that everyone can truly be a fighter in the cruel life, unafraid of everything and overcoming everything!</p>
<p>The victory of our motherland is not far away—we believe.</p>

<h3 id="e109">Paradise in Suffering <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>— Cui Jingtai</p>
<p>I have heard people say, "In a life and environment of suffering, we can see paradise." At first, I thought this was absurd, but recently, I have come to realize the truth of this statement.</p>
<p>Here, I will only talk about the past few years. My father has been very poor, but he is a relatively self-controlled and kind person. He treats relatives, friends, and family members with a sincere enthusiasm, and it does not change slightly because of poverty. I know that he would rather drink the bitter cup and bear the heavy burden himself than let his family have any worries. He always tries his best to help those relatives and friends who are in even more difficult situations than our family. He is gentle and has no resentment, and he has no air of self-importance. My heart is often stirred by my father's sincere love, making me aware of the true interest of life and the ability of love that connects this universe and life. If my heart were as broad and gentle as my father's, then my poor family would actually be paradise. Recently, my father has been ill in the hospital. When I first went to see him, the desolate scene in the ward immediately brought a wave of sadness and fear of life to my heart. I looked at my father and the other patients groaning weakly and looking uncomfortable, and the intertwined pain in my heart was really unspeakable. But my father still comforted me, saying that the nurses took very good care of him, and that their kind service spirit moved him very much. In the ward, there was no coldness of human relationships, but rather a full of ultimate comfort. He was often able to forget the threat of poverty, illness, or death. He firmly believes that in this environment, he will soon recover.</p>
<p>Oh! I am very grateful to the nurses, because they have this enthusiasm to serve the patients. At the same time, I must also hope that the nurses will always make their love firm, and not become indifferent due to habit, because the ward needs eternal love.</p>
<p>Originally, the ultimate expression of true nature between people can only be expressed in suffering. If you and I both have a firm love to treat others, then paradise will appear in this seemingly suffering hell.</p>

<h3 id="e111">Cao Yu's "Thinking About It" <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Yi</p>
<p>Since the Anti-Japanese War, people squatting in Shanghai have not read any new works by Cao Yu. But fortunately, three years later, we finally read his "Thinking About It."</p>
<p>"Thinking About It" is a single-act comedy, although its ending is very unfavorable for the protagonists in the play, in the eyes of the readers, this is indeed a complete farcical comedy. Saying it is "farcical" does not seem very appropriate, because it is definitely not simply something that makes readers laugh, but a work with ironic undertones. For example, in the twentieth page, "Old Gourd" wants to show off his "genius," but is exposed by his son "Little Baldy," although it is very funny, but in this "laughing" there is a lot of humor.</p>
<p>In terms of plot, it is not as ingenious as "Thunderstorm," nor as tragic as "Sunrise," and it does not have the grandeur of "Wilderness," but it is also a work worth reading carefully.</p>
<p>Because this is a comedy, perhaps it was very difficult for the author. (In general, writing comedies is more difficult than writing tragedies, because comedies are not easy to move people). But undeniably, the author's "effort" in "Thinking About It" has achieved considerable results. He not only wrote the protagonists "Old Gourd" and "Little Sweet Gourd" vividly, but also the supporting roles "Little Red" and "Teacher Ding," the author also portrayed them as if they were real people. I think their characters and appearances are the two most moving and interesting depictions in the whole play.</p>
<p>Indeed, the plot of "Thinking About It" is not as tight, tragic, and grand as Cao Yu's previous three plays, but its achievements are no less than "Thunderstorm," "Sunrise," or "Wilderness." This is naturally the result of the author's efforts, but his innate talent for writing plays is also a force that helps the author write plays. I hope Cao Yu can work hard!</p>
<h3 id="e112">Experiences in Taking School Entrance Exams: It is Said That Mathematics and Physics and Chemistry Are the Most Difficult <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>— Bo</p>
<p>According to students who have participated in the entrance examinations for universities and secondary schools, the test questions are not very complex, but the difficulty lies in the mathematics and physics and chemistry problems, which are impossible to start. You must be familiar with the principles to be able to start, and relying on a few formulas alone is useless.</p>
<p>The mathematics and science test questions at this time are mostly based on the foreign mathematics and science textbooks translated by Guangwenshe, such as Fan's Advanced Algebra, Pott's Practical Physics, etc. Because these books are the most popular standard textbooks in domestic secondary schools, the test questions of various schools are based on them. In order to improve students' learning efficiency and facilitate preparation for entrance examinations, Guangwenshe has specially invited experts to compile a set of solutions to these textbooks. The explanations are accurate, detailed, and appropriate, surpassing other solution books. For self-study or taking entrance examinations for universities and secondary schools, this solution book is the most helpful.</p>
<p>The price of these solution books is extremely low: Fan's Advanced Algebra Solution 2.7 yuan, Pott's Practical Physics Solution 2 yuan, Pott's Practical Chemistry Solution 1.8 yuan, Three S Plane Geometry Solution 2.4 yuan, Three S Solid Geometry Solution 0.9 yuan, Ge's Plane Trigonometry Solution 2.2 yuan, and Analytical Geometry Solution 2.2 yuan, all sold by World Book Company.</p>

<p>Chapter 5: Bad News</p>
<p>Hawthorn replied: "As far as the current situation is concerned, that is indeed the case. However, you must also understand that there is definitely more than one person directly related to this case. We cannot focus our attention solely on him."</p>
<p>I still argued: "Although we cannot focus solely, we cannot completely ignore it either."</p>
<p>Hawthorn nodded, without answering.</p>
<p>I said again: "Then, do you have a concrete plan for how to find this Zhao Boxiong?"</p>
<p>Hawthorn shook his head. "Not yet, but I don't think it will be too difficult to find this person. Since he has lived here for a month and has many friends, and since he was acquainted with Wang Lilan, he must often go to dance halls or other social gatherings. In addition, we have his photo—alas, the elevator is coming down."</p>
<p>The elevator came down from the eighth floor, opened the door, and we went in. It reached the bottom floor, and we left the elevator. After that, Zhai Sang went to the telephone booth where the employees were leaving work, saying that he wanted to ask if Ni Jinshou had returned to the office. After he went into the telephone booth, he left the door open, and I stood outside, so I could hear his conversation. After the phone was connected, he was very happy, clearly Ni Jinshou had returned to the police station.</p>
<p>He said into the phone: "Brother Jinshou, this is Hawthorn... Any news?... What? Lu Jiansheng did not go to the Yangtze Hotel last night?... Strange!... Alas! I can't hear clearly... Ah, there is someone surnamed Liu in the same dormitory as Yu Gantang, right?... Hmm, hmm... What did the person surnamed Liu say?... Yu Gantang did not return to the dormitory until after midnight last night?... Did he say what time?... Not specified?... Yes, that time is suspicious enough..."</p>

<h3 id="e114">On the Qixi Festival and Theater <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>— Junmei</p>
<p>In the world of theater, paying attention to seasonal dramas has always been a tradition. For instance, during the New Year, there's "Qing Shi Mountain"; for the Dragon Boat Festival, there's "Hun Yuan Box"; and for the Mid-Autumn Festival, there's "Tian Xiang Qing Jie." In the early days, these seasonal plays were mainly for symbolic embellishment. In recent years, however, performing seasonal plays has become common practice in the theater world. Examples include "Shang Yuan Lady," "Fighting Bull Official," "Lantern Riddles," and "Lantern Festival" for the Lantern Festival; "Peach Banquet," "Little Tomb Sweeping," and "Butterfly Dream" for Qingming Festival; "Yulan Sacred Assembly" for the Ghost Festival; "Chang'e Flying to the Moon" for the Mid-Autumn Festival; "Burning Mianshan Mountain" for the Double Ninth Festival; and "Little New Year" for New Year's Eve. It seems every festival is celebrated with a corresponding play, making it a popular trend for a while. Time flies, and now it's time to talk about the Cowherd again. Tonight is the Qixi Festival, a night for lovers. The theater reports are filled with announcements for "The Heavenly River Match."</p>
<p>"The Heavenly River Match" is derived from Kunqu and Yiyang opera. Early performances involved crossing the Silver River, interweaving the story with the lovers' secret vows on the Magpie Bridge and adding elements from the Kunqu opera "The Palace of Eternal Life." Among the most notable performances were those by the Shuangqing Troupe, with Han Chunli as the Cowherd, Di Chunxian as the Weaver Girl, Lu Anlin as Emperor Ming, and Wu Linxian as Consort Yang. In the Fushou Troupe's version, Lu Huayun played Emperor Ming, Zhu Qiufen played Consort Yang, Zhang Zhiquan played the Weaver Girl, and the Shuangqing Troupe's Lantern "Heavenly River Match," featuring Zhu Suyun as the Cowherd and Wang Huifang as the Weaver Girl, along with Liu Jingran and Zhang Shoutian, was a unique take on the story. After Wang Yaoqing's performance, the story gradually became more mythological, with added embellishments and new interpretations each year. Despite the diverse styles, the core narrative remained the same: brothers dividing the family property, bathing in the lotus pond, and the descent of the Cow God, all aimed at creating a lively and exciting spectacle. The most popular performance of "The Heavenly River Match" for the Qixi Festival remains the one at the First Stage in the former capital of Republic Year Three. Not only was the cast strong, with Wang Yaoqing as the Weaver Girl, Jin Zhongren as the Cowherd, Zhang Wenbin as Ga's, Jia Honglin as Zhang Youcai, Li Lianzhong as the Golden Ox Star, Li Shunting as the Jade Emperor, and Yao Peilan, Wang Liqing, and Zhu Ruxiang as the fairies, but also the large revolving stage, the real water spraying in the lotus pond, and the Magpie Bridge adorned with electric lights created a magnificent and beautiful scene, pioneering the use of three-dimensional scenery. At the Qixi Festival in Republic Year Eight, Mei Wanhua performed "The Heavenly River Match" at the New Ming Theater in the former capital, with Mei playing the Weaver Girl, Gao Qingkui playing Zhang Shouyi, Li Jingshan playing Ga's, Li Lianzhong playing the Golden Ox Star, Zha Jinkui playing the Jade Emperor, Zhao Zhixiang playing the Jade Empress, and Luo Fushan playing the Queen Mother of the West. They were supported by a cast of eight fairies played by Wan Zhan Deng, Xiao Fenghuang, Zhu Ruxiang, Wang Liqing, Zhu Guifang, Yao Yufu, Furong Cao, and Cheng Yanqiu.</p>
<p>With beautiful singing and graceful dancing, the ensemble was remarkably well-coordinated, with everything in its place. In recent years, there have been good cross-dressing performances of "The Heavenly River Match." It is recorded that Hao Shouchu and Gao Qingkui once performed it together. In the lotus pond bathing scene, Hao wore a bright red bellyband and red slippers, using his painted face to create a flirtatious persona, which amused the audience and added a unique humor to the play. The Shanghai version of "The Heavenly River Match" incorporated special fighting scenes and plays within the play, offering a novel and refreshing take. It is said to have originated during the collaboration between Xiao San Mazi and Xi Cailian, and the plot went something like this: "Before the Weaver Girl descended to earth, one day during a heavy rain, the Magpie King was chased by the Thunder God and sought refuge with the Weaver Girl, thus earning her gratitude. Later, when the Weaver Girl had a difficult labor after marrying the Cowherd, the Magpie King stole a lingzhi mushroom for her, leading to a fight with the Deer and Crane Pages. After the birth, a grand full-month celebration was held, resulting in plays within the play." Though not necessarily profound, it certainly provided entertainment for the audience.</p>
<p>In the past, performances of "The Heavenly River Match" during the Qixi Festival would last for no more than five or six evenings. In recent years, theaters have competed to showcase unique and dazzling productions, extending the performance period beyond the usual. They start performing in July. Two years ago, Shang Xiaoyun's Rongchun Troupe performed "The Heavenly River Match" in the former capital for eighteen consecutive nights, with every seat filled, breaking the record for Qixi Festival performances of the play. A unique feature of Rongchun's production was the "building block picture and lantern arrangement" at the end. The "building block picture" involved enlarged versions of children's building blocks, each held by thirty-two children, who arranged them into various pavilions, bridges, and archways with swift and coordinated movements, creating a beautiful spectacle. The "lantern arrangement" involved five children each holding two lotus lanterns, wearing lotus leaf costumes and gold crowns. As the drums beat, they moved in time with the music, forming the shape of a plum blossom. When the drums stopped, the lanterns flickered, spelling out the words "Qixi Begging for Skills," creating a magnificent and awe-inspiring sight. Shang Xiaoyun's ingenuity ensured its popularity for eighteen performances. Besides "The Heavenly River Match," other Qixi Festival plays included "Zhan Long Every Day" and "Zi Jin Riding a Crane," but these were rarely performed outside the palace in the past. As for "Yun Jin Chang," which was once performed by Lei Xifu and Li Lianzhen, with Lianzhen playing the Weaver Girl and Xifu playing Guo Fenyang, it disappeared after Lianzhen's death. Other plays like "The Weaver Girl's Story," "The Story of Dong Yong," "The Acacia Inkstone," which even included Sun Wukong, and "The Meeting of Two Stars" were all based on fantasy and mixed with human emotions, and are now mostly forgotten.</p>

<p>Forging an Iron-Like Artistic Troupe</p>
<p>The "Frontline Storm" Northwest Film Crew, including Ying Yunwei, Zhou Boxun, Li Lili, Shu Xiuwen, Wu Yin, Chen Tianguo, and more than thirty others, departed from Chongqing on January 5th this year, which means it has been seven months already. Recently, they sent back a large batch of photos and diaries to the Chongqing headquarters, bringing good news: their work there is progressing smoothly, and they expect to finish and return to Chongqing around mid-August. Among the photos they sent back were costume photos of Li Lili, Shu Xiuwen, and Zhou Boxun. Their costumes and decorations are entirely similar to those of the local Mongolians, yet different from the costumes in the stage play "Frontline Storm." This alone will undoubtedly provide audiences across the country with many novel sights and experiences when the film is released. It is said that the "Chinese" authorities are planning to hold a grand exhibition in Chongqing, Chengdu, and Kunming after the completion of "Frontline Storm," showcasing all the costumes and props, with the aim of integrating "anti-Japanese war propaganda" and "public education" through "exhibition." From the photos and letters they sent, we know that they are all in good health. They have learned excellent horsemanship in the border region, and their collective life has forged them into an iron-like artistic troupe.</p>

<p>Since the Xin Du Night Garden was taken over by the Zi You Xin Xin Company, it has held charitable garden parties for Li Qinian and Li Lihua, donating all the ticket sales to Shanghai's emergency epidemic hospital, which has earned a good impression from all sectors of society. Recently, under expanded promotion by the Movie Fan Service, the Xin Du Night Garden held a "Chinese and Foreign Costume Dance Party," inviting socialites from Shanghai, famous artists, and prominent ladies to participate.</p>
<p>The scale of the event is quite grand, with an estimated fifty different Chinese and foreign costumes to be showcased. One-third of the movie stars have already booked tickets to participate, and Bai Le Men's famous dancer Ding Xiang will also attend in full dress. The gifts donated by various manufacturers include well-known Chinese and foreign brands such as Zhang Yu Brandy, wine, and Green Treasure orange juice, which are fragrant and refreshing, adding to the guests' enjoyment.</p>
<p>Costume balls are popular in European and American high society banquets. This is a new concept in Shanghai, and this grand event, held on Qixi Festival, is a novel and unique addition to Shanghai's dance scene.</p>

<p>— Edited by Lian Xuezheng from Putian</p>
<p>Opening Method, Game 67, Black Moves First</p>
<p>Cannon 2 to 5, Horse 2 advances 3, Horse 2 advances 3, Cannon 8 to 6, Pawn 5 advances 1</p>
<p>Minister 4 advances 5, Horse 8 advances 7, Elephant 3 advances 5, Horse 7 advances 5, Chariot 1 to 4</p>
<p>Chariot 1 to 2, Horse 8 advances 7, Chariot 2 advances 6, Chariot 9 advances 2, Pawn 5 advances 1</p>
<p>Soldier 5 advances 1, Chariot 2 to 3</p>
<p>The explanation of this game is that Red moves first, protecting with Minister and Cannon, creating a wind screen, a Horse formation against a Head-on Cannon. Red protects with the Minister Cannon to prevent Black's Horse 8 from advancing 7. When Black's Pawn 5 advances 1, Red must respond with Minister 4 advancing 5, Horse 8 advancing 7, Elephant 3 advancing 5, Horse 7 advancing 5, all of which are essential moves. After that, Pawn 5 advancing 1 is a key move, and Red must respond with Soldier 5 advancing 1. At this point, Black maintains the initiative, and Red must respond cautiously. (Also, in this game, if Red Chariot 1 to 4 is changed to Horse 8 advancing 7, there is another method of play. To be continued in the next issue.)</p>
