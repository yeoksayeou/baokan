<p>社評</p>
<h3>日人擴展封鎖與上海市面</h3>
<p>據江海關所發表，本年上半年六個月中，又呈出超之現象；驟視之似爲市面繁榮之證；衡其實際，又未可如是其樂觀也。蓋進口貨用金單位計値，仍照中央銀行法定匯率爲標準，即每一關金單位，合法幣二元七角零七釐之數，算成法幣，故其所得之結果，自照用黑匯所算得之數字爲小。而出口貨値之膨脹，則固受黑匯緊縮促使物價上漲之影響，故比較爲大。於是實際上以兩者向不相侔之計算單位，作爲比較，而發現出超兩萬五千萬元之形態。若進口貨値同樣以黑匯行市換算，則入超之鉅，試觀下表，即可知其梗槪矣。</p>
<p>計算方式　據以所算得之進口貨合法幣數　與出口貨値比較後之出超或入超數</p>
<p>（一）照中央掛牌關金合法幣二·七〇七元計算　三八五、五五三、五九九　出二五一、八九八、九七一</p>
<p>（二）照黑滙英金換算關金合法幣九·七五元計算　一、三八八、六七六、六〇五　入七五一、二二四、〇三五</p>
<p>（三）又照美金換算關金合法幣一一元計算　一、五六六、七一二、〇七〇　入九二九、二五九、五〇〇</p>
<p>（註）進口貨為一四二、四二八、三七〇金單位、出口貨為法幣六三七、四五二、五七〇元、照此換算比較計算、</p>
<p>蓋一照黑匯行市，用英金計算，則一變而爲入超有七萬五千萬元，照美金則入超竟及九萬三千萬元，若是，果得謂之「對外貿易好轉」可乎？夫以戰事頻年入超仍有如是之鉅，想見滬上人士，逸豫耽樂，未能改變其豪奢之習，至惟洋貨是求也。</p>
<p>今者，日本一面迫使英法屈伏將緬越通西南之孔道，加强封鎖，一面冉用艦隊力量，封鎖自杭州灣以至泉州之海運。從此而後，中國除由西北交通蘇聯之外，別無達道；將使內地對外尤深隔閡之感，上海工商更乏活躍之地。其實一利一害、輒復相隨，未可執一而論也。要知緊密封鎖之結果：中國人民之物質生活誠不免增加苦悶，而各國對華貿易亦受鉅大損失，以美國爲最甚；此所刺激國際，使之反應於反侵略者，以及昭告國際，使之加强門戶開放之主張者，必形成有裨於方來大局之重要因素，此其一。一面雖爲遮斷來貨，一面即係堵塞漏巵，此其二。物質取給之艱難，乃爲一時當然之現象；然由此而刺激內地努力生產，促進自給自足政策之完成，乃爲必然趨勢；此其三。近頃由浙閩沿岸滲透以入內地之貨物，西洋貨甚少，國貨亦無幾，而改頭換面之國貨獨多，今後則由日艦自行禁絕之，此其四。關收旁落，徒資日方運用，自此當見銳减，此其五。惟此五端，正不必視封鎖爲對方如何凶惡之舉措；而對付封鎖之方法，要在忍耐一時苦悶，竭全力以創造悠久之基礎，開闢廣大之新天地而已。</p>
<p>更就上海一隅而言之，閩浙海口封鎖期間，對外貿易必視上半年有顯著之衰退，姑不必問其爲入超抑出超。蓋上海人士之逸豫耽樂，靡費豪奢，乃致造成龐大之進出口貿易總額者，上海富力僅居較小之原因；考其主要緣由，還在上海不失其爲呑吐之大港，吞吐之際，潤及上海市面。閩浙封鎖之後，上海至少喪失對於閩浙兩省之商業利益。抑閩浙海口又不僅閩浙兩省之門戶而已；經由閩浙而深入者，粵贛湘桂乃至四川，無不脈絡相通，客貨往來、數不在少；觀於封鎖之前，上海與閩浙間，海舶往來如梭，可爲明證；故上海此後所减少之吞吐總量，遠逾閩浙兩省之所產銷。以此推之，上海市面所受影響，其爲酷烈將何如？</p>
<p>上海市面爲環境所逼，勢必漸趨衰落，其間損失，中外共之；此自大局觀察，則並無多大意義。良以上海對於大局之比重，三年以來，業已漸次减削；及其市面衰落之後，比重减削愈甚；衰落之極，雖視爲幾等於零，亦無不可。惟以上海人士而論，必不自視如贅疣而坐視末運之來臨；爲今之計，切要者凡三：曰亟將資金儘量移之內地，從事生產，以謀補償，以圖發展；曰百業乃至於家家戶，儘量緊縮節約，以穩定生計，以延長維持活力之期間；曰抑制不正當之高抬物價與房租，並儘可能使之低落，以求相諒相成之道。竊尤願敬告上海工商界者，必須熟察今後上海、絕非曩日之比，凡百經營，皆須換一副頭腦，換一副眼光，另定方針，適應時勢；否則，小之則一業失敗，大之則全市恐慌，殆有不免者矣。</p>
<h3>對英封鎖滇緬路　美方官方殊感失望　美艦隊駐華威夷足增華勇氣　旅菲美僑電請採取强硬政策</h3>
<p>華盛頓　國務卿赫爾昨日拒絕對新聞記者評論央首相邱吉爾星期三向衆證實封鎖緬甸路之言論、唯大部份在華盛頓之訪員皆感得一深刻印象、卽美國官方大半對英國此舉殊感失望是也、赫爾聲稱、在未接得關於邱吉爾之正式演辭之前、渠不加以批評、觀察家以爲此係避免與英首相直接衝突之唯一方法、但赫爾前已兩度對此事表示强硬抗議矣、官方人士對英國將封鎖緬甸路與促成中日和平混爲一談、殊不感到深刻印象、然官方同樣拒絕加以批評、中立觀察家相信公正之和平現時不易產生、因中國尙有無窮力量繼　抵抗、斷不肯經易接受日本基於補償三年中所損失之條件也、接近官方之人十多不對英日協定加以過分之注意、蓋在封鎖之三月內、因雨季關係、該路根本不易通車、彼等稱在此三月內英國將表現其實力、以抗德軍進攻屆時英國將站在較佳之形勢下、與日本再度談判緬甸路問題、此方面人士並稱、苟三月後之英國不對德屈服、則將在歐洲戰勝、屆時日本當不致再在東亞威脅英國也、同時彼等承認封鎖緬甸路將對一部份華人加以心理上之打擊、尤其當華人領袖或有正開始感覺喪失勇氣者、美國繼續採取堅決態度及美艦隊留駐夏威夷、或可增加華人之勇氣、面與以精神上之援助、渠等並稱、最近盛傳蘇聯遠東之大宗軍用品運輸、就心理上言、亦足以維持華人希望於不墜、（十九日合衆電）</p>
<p>馬尼刺　住居已歧俄鎭之美人四十人、昨日致電羅斯福總統、要求美國對緬甸路協定採取堅强之政策、該電與前致國務卿赫爾者及七月十六日致上海美第四海軍司令貝克上校者相同電云「吾人相信屈服於日本壓力之下、將爲吾人命運封閉之最可靠途徑、吾人要求美國採取堅强之態度」、（十九日合衆社電）</p>
<p>邱吉爾言不欲强迫中國和平</p>
<p>倫敦　英相邱吉爾昨在下院聲明英國欲見中國完整之保持後、工黨諾爾巴克問曰、首相此言、可謂爲英政府絕不欲强以和平加諸中國人民或迫令其接受等於對侵略投降之和平條件乎、邱吉爾答曰、此說實獲我心、諾爾巴克又問曰、首相意謂英政府仍遵守其以九國公約等爲基礎之遠東政策乎、邱答曰、余已宜讀曾經愼重考慮之言論、從前余對此事之見解爲衆所知、此時余不欲續有陳說、前陸相倍利夏問曰、首相豈以爲此次對日讓步確可得日本好意乎、首相曾始終商諸美蘇政府、並獲其同意而行事乎、邱答曰、余不能給予此種保證、余絕無所知、余想吾人在遠東所遭遇者、將甚受吾人在此所遭遇者之影饗、當然吾人所已爲者、並非未將美蘇態度加以完全考慮而爲者、保守黨密爾納問首相可吾及早給予機會、俾對遠東地位作整個之辯論、首相答稱、今後一二週中當可作外交事件之辯論、保守黨覺爾問外次、對日談判時將否避免英國願以壓力加諸中政府或鼓勵一南京政府」之印象、白特勒書面答稱、英政府未有壓迫中政府之意、亦不承認南京在政權、</p>
<p>同時外相哈立法克斯在上院宣讀關於緬甸路協定之同樣言論、上院工黨愛狄生指此協定爲最不幸之辦法、希望不致在中國等處發生其所慮之惡劣影響、前內務大臣薩繆爾稱、如數月內中日和平之希望不實現、則此辦法或須無期展長、馬萊問政府曾向駐美蘇大使商討此項決定在英蘇與英美關係上影響乎、外相答稱、政府曾將此事通知其駐使、渠現未便說明交換意見之程度、但渠以爲政府並未忽視此種考慮、政府未嘗不注意本國所已接受之義務與本國所簽定之九國公的、關於此事之辯論、稍緩可秘密舉行、（十九日路透社電）</p>
<p>對日妥協英政界歸咎於蘇美</p>
<p>倫敦　此間政界人士頃就英國封鎖滇緬公路事、加以評論、聞英國所由與日本成立協定、實因未能自美蘇兩國取得援助所致、英國政府巳將此項交涉經過、通知美國政府、要之英國倘因採取强硬政策之故、而與日本發生嚴重困難、美國未必能予以充份之援助、至以蘇聯而論、英國政府未將交涉情形詳吿該國、緣英國駐蘇聯大使克利沛斯爵士與史丹林會晤情形、雖極融洽、但英蘇兩國互相接近之程度、猶不足以支持、英國在此種情形之下、英國自米便在遠東採取一種政策、徒足以增加其實任、又况此際英國正以其全部資源力量、對付歐洲戰事、實屬無暇他顧、苟非美蘇兩大中立國咸能在遠東方面採取堅決態度、則英國殊不能有所作爲明矣、（十九日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<p>蘇聯否認英曾向蘇徵詢意見</p>
<p>莫斯科　英首相邱吉爾昨日在下院報吿封鎖緬滇路英日協定時曾稱、「關於該協定、英方巳與蘇聯商討一過、塔斯社頃由官方授權聲明、英首相所云、並不確實、事實上、英政府並未向蘇聯徵詢關於此事之意見或忠吿、易言之、英方並未與蘇聯商談該項問題、且在目前蘇英關係狀態下、英政府並無向蘇聯商討此事之必要、實際上英外次白脫萊僅通知蘇聯英大使邁斯基、聲明英政府決與日方成立關於封鎖緬滇公路問題之協定、（十九日塔斯社電）</p>
<p>中國抗戰決心並不因此削弱</p>
<p>重慶　滇越與滇緬運輸路綫、相繼中斷之後、中國政府關係各部、現正籌措有效步驟、俾克繼續獲得接濟、同時西北公路運輸較前愈益便利、以故此一方面接濟數量、必可增加、查蘇聯所畀予中國之信用放款、尙有餘額、儘可大量購買貨物、至以英國封鎖滇緬公路以對日讓步一事而論、此間各界人士僉謂中國抗戰到底之決心、匪特不因之削弱、且益將增强、某要人向哈瓦斯社訪員談稱、英國對於中國背棄諾言之所爲、終局將轉於中國有利、蓋吾人對於完全自給自足之爲必要、業有充分認識、爰已努力開發本身各種資源、在開發工作收效之前、現所貯存各種主要物品、儘足敷用、另有某要人、亦向哈瓦斯社訪員談稱、「凡以爲日本倘若提出紙面上相當之動聽之和平條件、蔣總裁或可予以接受者、實屬不知蔣總裁之爲人、蓋渠深知此種條件、日本決不能付諸實施、且中國資源並未涸竭、尙可作戰若干年之久、故決心賡續抗戰、初不願因日本方面之不可靠的諾言、而冒險以中國之命運作爲博注、彼日本現亟欲暫時了結戰事、以便在他處攫取機會、一俟在太平洋方面有所獲得、其勢力愈益增强之後、卽將再度轉移視綫於中國、溯自中日戰事發生以還、外國輿論對於中國抵抗之決心與支持之能力、往往估計過低、以致舛誤百出、此際若仍以爲中國願接受日本空洞之諾言、是又大謬矣」、（十九日哈瓦斯社電）</p>

<h3>日稱不欲他國調停中日戰爭</h3>
<p>東京　日外務省發言人須磨彌吉郞頃語報界、謂日本並不思第三國調停中日戰事、須磨繼評論英國企圖調停中日戰事之訊、謂任何之調停、均應以日本之條件爲基礎、（十九日合衆社電）</p>
<p>香港　東京訊、外務省今日招待新聞界時、發言人聲稱日本目前不擬亦不歡迎第三國出面調停或干預中日事件、記者詢以日本對邱吉爾演說之反響如何、發言人稱、邱吉爾之演說、闡明英國對中日兩國之意向、此點頗令人感覺興趣、惟外國從未向日本建議對華議和、新加坡代理總督瓊思廣播演說之所云、並非事實、苟他國提出是項建議、則日方須視其中所列條件之內容、乃當前之環境而作決定、記者詢以日本議和條件、發言人稱不便討論、記者詢以羅斯福當選總統候選人、日方之觀感如何、發言人稱日本對美國下屆總統候選人爲誰、並不感覺興趣、日本之注意力、集中於美國之外交政策、特別是遠東政策、予希望美國政策能採取合理之原則、記者詢以日美妥協之時機是否業已逝去、發言人稱日本已完全公開表示態度、希望改進對美關係、過去半年中、日本向在等待美國直截了當之答覆、但至目前止、爲時仍非過晚云、（十九日電）</p>
<p>東京　日本希望美國肯開誠佈公俾得各抒已見、獲得諒解、日本外務省發言人稱、美國如肯惠予明確之答復、則失之東隅者猶可收之桑楡、又稱目前日本不擬請第三國干涉中日之戰事、（十九日海通電）</p>

<h3>港婦行將繼續撤退</h3>
<p>香港　香港電聞報探悉、外國婦孺將於本月二十五日繼續撤退、聞現已僱船一艘以供此用、衆信若輩將直赴澳洲·又聞香港政府現擬設一法庭、辦理反對撤退之上訴案、惟除婦女之勝任看護者外、獲許留港者必寥寥無幾（十九日路透社電）</p>

<h3>甘省府職員救濟渝市難民</h3>
<p>重慶　甘肅省府職員、以日機濫炸行都、特集國幣二萬元、作救濟渝市難民之用、（十九日電）</p>
<p>重慶　據此間一般人估計、日機最近襲渝、每次所投炸彈、均在百噸以上、居民咸搜集碎片、以此出售、頗可獲利、嘗有茅屋一所、被日機炸壞、修繕費用、不過二十元左右、而屋主搜集鐵片一百斤出售、竟得一百七十元、修葺之後、尙餘百五十元、據一般狀况而論、此間被炸之後、立卽開始修葺、恢復舊觀、至爲迅速、日本欲使渝市糜爛至於不能居住之程度、則轟炸猛烈情形、至少須較往時增加四倍、此外最近數日氣候轉凉、炎暑頓消、居民極爲欣慰、加之雲層降低、故雖値月中、夜光皎潔、日機未能賡續飛來轟炸、要之蔣委員長嘗曰中國人民決心抗戰到底、以詢此間各界人士、卽知此言之不謬、（十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>近衛組閣工作旦夕即可完成　昨與新任陸海外三相商外交國防基本政策</h3>
<p>東京　據日本半官方消息云、今日近衛內閣之重要閣員四人、曾開會討論、歷五小時許始散、對於外交及國防之基本政策、意見已完全臻於妥協、出席爲新任首相近衛·陸相東條·海相吉田·及外相松岡洋右、近衛組閣之努力、現料將有迅速之進步、（十九日路透電）</p>
<p>東京　政治觀察家頃預料、首相近衛或將於明日完成其內閣人選、因近衛於今日下午已曾延見其所選定之三閣員、卽陸相東條·海相吉田·及外相松岡三人共商政策、聞所商者係一黨制度成立後之外交內政以及鞏固全國政治陣綫等問題、消息靈通方面相信、近衛內閣將準備據世界局勢之最近變化、以確定其外交政策、此後日本之外交政策、將特別注重於對德對義對英對蘇方面、此外並將實施全國總動員令、暨鞏固國防等、至新內閣對「南京政府」之政策、將一仍不變、並將加緊對華軍事行動、以期儘速結東中國戰事云（十九日合衆電）</p>
<p>東京　「日日新聞」今日載稱、外相兼拓相之松岡所抱見解、以爲日本在東亞與德義在歐洲皆應向前推進、俾各達其目的、日本首應消弭英法在東亞之勢力、然後穩定包涵中日「滿」與南洋之廣大新機構、終則與德義商訂聯盟、惟目下與極權國家作無條件的接近、則不生效力、再美國干涉東亞與西太平洋事件之傾向、乃「遠東之最大威脅」、應完全消滅之云、（十九日路透社電）</p>
<p>重慶　半官報紙英文楚報頃稱、日本之近衛組閣、實爲日本政治破產之徵兆、該報謂、近衛曾於中日戰事爆發前夕出任首相、但結果旣未能阻止戰爭、亦未能使戰爭早日結束、「近衛以前旣未能使日人脫離中國泥潭、吾人相信此番近衛亦必趨於同一之失望云、該報繼稱、日軍部之屬意近衛、係不滿於多政黨之故、因近衛主張一黨制度、遂爲日本軍部所贊同、該報又稱、日本欲結束中日戰事、唯有兩途可循、第一、自動承認錯誤撇退日軍、第二、採用極度兵力摧毀中國之抵抗、第一點、日本決不致採取、且日本之省領亦無採用此項策略之智慧與膽量、第二點、恐日本亦覺其不可能、因日本現在業已採用極度之兵力以攻中國、中國之軍隊愈鬥愈勇、而日本軍隊惟遭可悲之失敗、日本因政治破產、遂思利用歐戰之機會從事南進、以冀獲取越南及荷屬東印度云、（十九日合衆電）</p>

<p>德蘇關係貌合神離</p>
<p>記者在蘇十五日所得之深刻印象、卽蘇聯相信羅馬柏林軸心一旦擊倒英國時、必將移向蘇聯、因此德義對英國之戰未能獲得決定以前、蘇聯似將動員所有軍事及民間力量、以造成其空前未有之偉大軍力、據可靠新聞界消息、法國之迅速崩潰、予蘇聯之人民及政府之高級官員以極重大之打擊、瑞典京城之德國人士曁莫斯科之蘇聯人士承認德蘇兩國間之貌合神離、且有謂於最近有發生利益衝突之可能、記者在蘇聯時已證明史丹林之政策、係在波羅的海及巴爾幹及其他方面攫取重要之軍事據點、以增强其防衛位置、</p>

<h3>美在阿拉斯加開闢空軍根據地</h3>
<p>美國爲了遠東問題的日趨嚴重，以防萬一起見，海軍部對於阿拉斯加那個飛行塲的建設工作，進行極速。兩個水上飛機塲，一個在席卡，另一個在柯迪克，是去年秋天開工的，建築費共一二，七三九，〇〇〇美元，預定三年內完成。</p>
<p>第三個水上飛機的良港是恩那拉斯加島上的荷蘭港，目前只有一座海軍無綫電台，及少數居民，尙無永久海軍建設在進行中，或計劃中。</p>
<p>這些水上飛機塲，在軍略上的價値，都極重要，從這些飛機塲起飛的飛機，能够巡邏北太平洋的大部份，保護美國沿海商業，防止敵軍的襲擊。最新式水上飛機，可以飛達一千二百英里至一千五百英里的距離，因此，此項飛機自柯迪克及夏威夷羣島的珍珠港起飛，差不多可以偵察至極遠地帶</p>
<p>水上飛機可以從西雅圖起飛，抵達席卡，向西而至柯迪克。席卡離柯迪克五百五十三英里。從西雅圖直綫到柯迪克只有一千二百三十七英里。不過因爲全程皆在大洋中，而該一帶氣候極爲惡劣，海軍部因決定至柯迪克的飛行，將分爲兩段。希望在恩那拉斯加島荷蘭港建造輔助飛機站，但此項工程，尙未進行。</p>
<p>按照海軍部的原來計劃，柯迪克本爲次等根據地，但其設備，大部分，却是頭等根據地的性質。預定在三年以內，該處可停偵察機隊兩隊，在緊急時，可停三隊。該處並將設有兵營，倉庫，及飛機修理之機器。該區氣候極寒冷風極大，倉庫乃為二十四架常駐飛機的必要設備。</p>
<p>柯迪克的氣候難極爲惡劣，然比之阿拉斯加的別的地方，則情形尙屬較好。荷蘭港附近一帶及阿留申羣島一帶，則氣候尤爲惡劣。因此柯迪克乃成爲阿拉斯加海軍飛機根據地中最爲優良的地點。</p>
<p>柯迪克飛機塲的開闢工作現已進行，其中包括大規模的濬港工作，這樣一來，在必要時，可派一水上飛機駁船至柯迪克。濬港工程完成後，該處還可用爲潛水艇的根據地。</p>
<p>恩那拉斯加根據地他日開闢之後，北太平洋方面偵察機的活動，至少可以擴展至五百英里，對付遠東方面的敵對勢力，自必益見有効。</p>
<p>海軍部有一時並曾想利用柯迪克爲陸上飛機根據地。陸上飛機塲雖可有許多便利，惟因該處常有重霧，將使陸上飛機的活動極爲危險，故此項計劃已決定放棄。水上飛機則可用盲目飛行，在十英里至十五英里外的海面降落，然後拖入倉庫。</p>
<p>席卡飛機塲的設備，本爲沿海飛往柯迪克機塲區留及其偵察機之用的，必要時也可供若干飛機隊臨時之用。來往柯迪克的飛機，由於氣候惡劣，在必要時，可以停留幾天。因此將造營房數所，倉庫及儲料所各一所，成爲一完美的根據地。</p>
<p>除此而外，美國與加拿大，並已開始討論設防問題。其中最重要的當在造成國際公路，俾得經過加拿大與阿拉斯加聯接。羅斯福總統與加拿大當局會在溫泉討論此項問題。此項公路長一千二百英里，建築費須一千四百萬美元。</p>
<p>阿拉斯加地位僻處一方，人口稀少，實爲美國與加拿大的最脆弱的一點。一旦日本或俄國自亞洲方面侵入，阿拉斯加卽須首當其衝。國際公路造成後，美國運輸軍隊及補充駐軍的給養均感便利。若干年後，也可幫助發展阿拉斯加的人力財力，使得獨立防止外來的侵略。</p>
<p>建造公路的障碍，乃在經費問題。加拿大在對德作戰之時，自不願接受此種負擔。其大部份經費當有美國負擔。</p>
<p>羅斯福總統今年是否將此問題提付議會，雖不可知，但他已請求議會延長國際公路局的任期，該局由民主黨衆院議員麥格納遜任主席，係與加拿大同樣機關合作。該局所發表的年報曾謂造建公路是値得加進行的計劃。對於發展阿拉斯及英屬哥倫比亞北部的天然富源，是一個很重要的因素，對於居民的福利及開拓一個廣大的新地帶，都極有供獻。</p>
<p>此舉更可以增加鐵路及輪船公司的收入，發展阿拉斯加的商業航空，增進美國與加拿大民間的睦誼。建造也極易實行。工程上的問題，早已解決。不過美國國際公路局與加拿大國際公路局的談判，對於建築費問題，及路綫問題，遼沒有成立具體的協定而已。</p>
<h3>香港局勢張弛不定</h3>
<p>香港通信、在法國政府接受日本無理要求、不許中外貨物運經越南之際、犯粤日軍、又復進陷深圳南頭以至沙頭角沙魚涌、逼近香港所屬之紛嶺一帶、日軍雖曾向香港軍事當局通吿，謂日軍並不移近香港邊境、但實際上香港邊境、已遭其威脅、又香港與粤省之交通、僅有沙魚涌一綫、其勢無異</p>
<p>藉斷絲連、日軍旣進至其間、卽將該交通綫切斷、又是無形完成從外圍錢包圍香港之勢、故近半旬來香港所賴越南及廣州灣與粵省沙魚涌運來之貨物、皆已停頓、乃同時又有日本向英國作對法國之同樣要求、不許中外貨物之進出運經香港及緬甸、於是香港邊境之日軍、益形活躍、陸海各軍、皆掠影於寳安大亞灣各處、以爲深圳沙頭角各處之日軍作聲援、而香港當局、爲安定邊區及</p>
<p>有備無患起見、一面在粉嶺一帶增兵運械、義勇軍亦開往助防、一面則在西環東環各處、趕築砲壘、同時又收繳平民軍械、因而影響所及、人心動搖、日用必需物品、無不乘勢增價、金融價格、亦向下降、據聞自去年九月間日軍初度進陷深圳時、曾有此嚴重情勢、茲則爲其再見也、香港當局、目下最重要的工作、厥爲疏散人口、其辦法分爲兩方面、一爲英國婦孺、實行</p>
<p>强制疏散第一批爲英軍家屬、第二批爲歐籍義勇軍家屬、第三掛爲芙籍一般婦孺家屬、第一批已於本月一日開始撤往菲律賓、其餘各批、亦撤往一非島或澳大利、一爲中國婦孺、而以英籍華人有功於香港或華人有功於香港者之眷屬爲限、其他華人、則勸令自行撤退、其從粤省內地逃難來港之貧民、亦設法遣送回籍、美國僑民、現亦先行撤往菲律賓、香港陸軍當局、曾宣稱此次疏散人口、純屬</p>
<p>預防性質非因時局有若何惡化影響所可顧慮者、乃爲糧食漲增問題及治安問題云、要之、目下香港情勢、實有外弛內緊的景象也、中國自抗戰以來、重要官員遷眷來港者、爲數甚衆、彼輩眷屬、連日亦紛紛離港、有赴美國或檀香山者、有就近赴菲律賓者、至於僑港之中國富商鉅賈、以在香港產業不能移動關係、故大都尙持鎭靜態度、惟祗在準備他遷之中耳、</p>

<h3>鎮海安謐砲戰激烈　日艦被擊沉三艘　少數日軍登陸都被殲滅　華砲兵調前方加强陣綫　滬甬郵電均通達但時間較遲滯</h3>
<p>自日海軍實行封鎖浙閩海口、日艦窺探鎮海口、日機復飛寧屬各處滋擾後、一時情勢　形緊張、前日日艦一艘在鎮海口外被華守軍擊沉、華當局爲增加防務實力起見、即抽調大軍趕往增援、決予痛擊、大中社記者於昨日下午謁晤寧波旅滬某聞人、叩詢甬　情形、據談、接甬電、寧屬均安、所傳日軍在鎮海登陸說、完全不確、惟今日（即昨日）泊鎮海口之日艦、會向華守軍作猛烈之砲轟、華守軍亦發揮威力、予以還擊、砲戰之激烈、爲日軍窺鎮海以來所僅見、聞結果日艦又被擊沉兩艘、傷若幹艘、日軍見華軍防守有方、始知難而退、寧波今雖遭日機掃射、但華方無損失、居民亦安謐、鎮海穿山附近之大榭島、亦曾於前日一度被日軍强行登陸、亦經守軍奮勇擊退、惟傳本市航商於昨午曾接泉州方面來電、謂「泉州於昨日上午十時、曾遭日機轟炸、碼頭棧房、略受損害。」</p>
<p>沿海戰報</p>
<p>大光社記者昨晚向本埠寧波旅滬團體探得戰報、十八日上午、停泊龍山觀海衛一帶廣集日艦、向沿海發砲二十六發，毁民房數間、鄞東橫山亦被日艦　　　　小學校落砲彈一枚、未　　　咸祥亦落三彈、僅震毁房屋十餘間、餘無損失、泊象山港黄牛礁日艦、亦曾於前日向岸砲擊、至昨晨泊鎮海口外瀝港洋面日　、已有五艘向西北杭州　方面他駛、鎮海口外小洟江南登陸日海軍陸戰隊百餘名、已被華軍趕到殲滅、又鎮海口菓山頭·金雞山·長跳嘴·定遠砲台·等處登岸日軍、亦已分别經大軍逐出、惟鎮海青峙地方、尚有小股殘日、現正在圍殲中、又在鎮海口外黄蠎島及七浬磯兩小島孤懸海外、面積狹小、除七浬磯骰有燈塔一座外、並無軍事價值、故絕無足重視、浙省主席黄紹弦、現以浙東情勢緊張、已辭别中極當局、自桂林兼程返抵浙東坐鎮、與第□集團軍總司令劉建緒、共同策商防務、連日華方中央國軍□□部及□□部已馳抵浙東前綫、其中並有砲兵一部、故沿海防務益臻鞏固、甬鎮人心鎮定、鎮海縣政府縣黨部等、已遷回城內辦公</p>
<p>郵電通達</p>
<p>滬甬電報自前日一度中斷後、旋即恢復通報、大中社記者昨自美商環球無綫電公司（即美商通訊社）獲悉、滬甬間電報照常通達、因寧波局勢緊張、滬甬間商行及個人親友相互探詢消息、叩問安全、以是兩地電訊往來頻繁、公司業務、反較平時爲盛、惟因滬拍往寧波之電報、收件人是否能收到、因寧波當局正疏散人口中、設或行號及個人遷往他處、則電報自難收到也、其浙東各市縣如金華·寧波·紹興·諸暨·餘姚·上虞·蘭　·嵊縣·新昌·東陽·義烏·奉化·溫州·等地輕便郵件、因航輪中斷、無法運往、故自十六日起所之以上各地郵件、尚囤存於該局棧內、茲聞首批業於昨晨起運、改道由福州轉發、嗣後凡寄往浙東郵件、均候輪運往、決不使其中斷、顧運送時日不無稍形延長、又寄往西南和省市郵件、郵局仍由海防轉發、外傳中斷或改道、皆不確、</p>
<p>日艦舉動</p>
<p>昨日上午起南京路一帶發現以「日本駐華艦隊司令部報道班」等名義所發之白色傳單甚多、內稱進擾浙東之「理由」、係在遮斷軍需運輸路棧、均經拾獲者撕毁、惟據定海來人談述當地情形、近數日內、盤踞定海日軍「舟山島基地隊」來島茂雄部隊、迭有增援、據談、係由上海開來、　頭對出港面、現泊有日艦四艘、及運輸盤（係輸船改造）一艘、並不時派小汽艇遊弋附近、又傳上海日海軍司令官　口修一郎、已於前日由滬搭艦抵定、企圖策動進擾浙東、</p>
<p>瀝港阻航</p>
<p>德商魯麟洋行之高登綸、本定於昨晚駛往浙海口瀝港、但昨日忽變更、其確切航期、該公司亦未能確定、英商馬利亞馬勒輪本定於今晨駛松門、且結關手續亦完畢、現亦奉命改駛海門、英商亞細亞火油公司之裝油輪二艘說於昨晨駛滬、</p>

<h3>香港情勢轉松　輪客漸減</h3>
<p>自香港情勢　　緊張後、旅港外僑婦孺搭輪撤退、華人亦頗多遷離、惟遷來滬地情勢已轉松馳、深圳邊境亦已平靜、故撤離者已形減少、不復如以前之擁擠、由港開駛來滬之各輪船票、原已售至二十日船期、茲亦頗多退票者，連日蛭滬之怡和山東泰生、太古之牛荘太原、以及捷成洋行之美　等各輪搭客、均已較前減少、美國總統郵般公司之塔虎脱總統號可於今日下午二時自港開駛抵滬、該輪此次載有撤退美僑婦孺一批、約五十人、將在滬暫棲、然所有搭客行李、則已不若柯立芝總統號之擁擠矣、</p>

<p>據煤業界消息、刻因煤價猛瀉、持有大量現貨煤商、已受嚴重威脅、虧耗頗钜、各貨市價、市塲明緊暗松、矧來源亦相繼湧至、存底不無與日俱增、故煤球制造成本顯超減輕、逾日同業買賣市價已步趨回落、顧門市開價亟待抑低、故望該業公會即日召集各廠代表協商抑價辦法、俾輕平民負擔、</p>

<h3>法商電車工潮　僵局仍未打開　鐵門繼續關閉渡船溺斃多命　勞資重行談判並無具體辦法</h3>
<p>自法商電車公司機務處銅匠間工人七百餘人、於十七日全體怠工、並集合南市、舉行會議、法租界當局、據聞獲有此項怠工另有「政治」作用之情報、為保持界內治安計、除派遣鐵甲車及大批警探在電車公司四周嚴密戒備外、並於前日將法租界所有通入南市之鐵門、一律關閉、此項戒備措施、昨日尙未解除、且因怠工之延宕而反現嚴重之趨勢、昨日法租界內所有遍佈各馬路之電燈公司之方棚室、均有荷槍安南巡捕一名守衛、其他如自來水廠·電燈廠·等公用機關、亦均由法華巡捕增崗守衛、嚴密戒備、迄未稍弛、</p>
<p>鐵門依舊全日關閉</p>
<p>自前日法租界當局因電車公司銅匠間工友罷工而突然將法華昆連處之鐵門全部對閉後、一時形勢、驟見緊張、往來於南市與租界之居及小販等、出入大感不便、大社記者於昨日下午、自南陽橋鐵門起、沿途巡視、見各鐵門依然關閉如故、以前出人比較繁劇之新北門·老北門·等處、則站有越捕三五人、荷槍駐守、遙望民國路及留香園路等處、除偶然有日軍用車疾駛而過外、行人幾全絕跡、一片荒涼景象，令人不勝有今昔之感、</p>
<p>渡船發生覆舟慘劇</p>
<p>因鐵門之關閉、居民如欲往來租界南中間、均須乘輪渡繞過浦東往返、昨晨八時、南碼頭因日僞警之干涉、羣衆爭先下船、船之重量、失去平衡、致有渡船三艘、慘遭失事、雖經設法救起多人、惟溺斃者、至少當在二三十人之間、</p>
<p>罷工工人傳將復工</p>
<p>銅匠室全體工人、於十七日罷工後、公司方面爲防止事態擴大、曾於前日（十八）下午三時與勞方代表舉行談判、公司當局表示、對勞方要求、願予考慮、但以先行復工爲條件、勞方則堅持非完全答應共要求、則不願復工、因之談判遂吿決裂、昨晨、雙方又重復談判、但未聞有何具體結果、惟昨傳罷工工人、有於今明復工之說、並謂資方已允工人每人每日加薪一元、每月加三十元、但訽之資方、則未有加以證實之表示、</p>
<p>逾分要求公司不滿</p>
<p>法商電車公司經理斐佛利稱、罷工之工人、其數的在六百與七百問、該項工人、一月前已加薪一次、此次相隔不久、又提出要求、且此次之要求、甚爲過分、其實公司待遇工人、較之上海任何其他大公司、並無多讓、據聞罷工工人有請求法租界各華董委出任調停之說、惟經向法租界納稅會暨董委個人方面探詢、均謂未接得此頃正式陳請、</p>
<p>暫雇俄人修理車輛</p>
<p>法商電車公司因擁有有及公共汽車之三種事業、故平日工作、素極忙碌，尤以機務處銅匠間等、因各項車輛駛行一日後、例有損壞、必須修理後、次日始能開出、故其工作、極爲重要、但自銅匠問工人罷工後、此項工作、無法繼續、致數日來停滯廠內待修車輛、極爲衆多、且其影響所及、有使行駛車輛因損壞而逐漸减少之可能、公司當局、爲維持公共交通之常態、特於前日起、另招俄籍之臨時工人數十人、加緊工作、將每日損壞車輛、加以修竣、故法租界內公共交通、當可無虞、</p>
<p>工友昨在南市集會</p>
<p>旋記者步行至外灘、趁民船渡至南碼頭登岸、進入南市、除因交通不便而使小本經營比較淸談外、住民尙能力持鎭靜、並不因封銷鐵門而驚恐、據關係方面探悉、法租界此次關閉鐵門起因、緣因罷工工人大部居住在南市、法租界當局爲防備罷工工人受人利用、致擴大工潮起見、故將各鐵門一律關閉、以示抵抗、聞罷工工人、昨日上下午仍麕集公共體育塲、會商關於所提增加工資辦法、請法當局從速承認、以免事態日趨嚴重、而造成不良之後果、惟記者趕至公共體育塲時、則工人大部均已散去、後經記者在另一方面探悉、工人等所要求公司普加之三成薪工、經工人代表與當局商洽後、公司允卽考慮、覓取折衷辦法、如當局能誠意合作、則工潮今日可順利解決、各處鐵門、亦可照常開啟、</p>
<h3>滿州貸物　私運華北　去年値日金一萬五千萬　尤以熱河雅片運往爲多</h3>
<p>英文大美易報云、據東京半官「日本時郵報」載稱、日方近雖在沿長城關卡加緊統制、然滿洲仍有貸物、大舉私運入華北、估計去歲私運貸物、價值日金一萬五千萬元、內泰半為雅片、尤以熱河私運入華北之雅片為最多、致熱河正常雅片稅收、損失半數、滿洲與華北兩區物價水準、相差甚巨、此爲私運繼續不輟之重因、多種貨物、在長城以南之價格、三倍於長城以北、</p>
<h3>日憲兵被扣事件　美方重作調查　經貝與三浦會商決定</h3>
<p>泰晤士報云、美海軍第四聯隊司令貝克上校、已對於美防軍扣留日憲兵十六人一案、開始作詳細之調查、日權威方面則認爲如有必要、日方當可允許當時被捕之憲兵十六人前往作證、據權威方面宣稱、此項決定、乃貝克上校與日憲兵司令三浦少校數日來會商之結果、</p>
<p>日領致函美總領事</p>
<p>關於上星期日僑二人在東方咖啡館內被美海軍第四聯隊兵士毆打一案、日總領事三浦義秋、已致函美國總領事、函內根據日本領事警察調查所得之結果、群述該案出事之經過情形、要求美總領事對「行兇」之二兵士、加以懲戒、並要求「整飭紀律」、以免將來，發生同樣之事件、同時代表受傷之二日人、保留要求賠償損失之權、</p>
<h3>英商自來火公司　全體工人怠工　向公司提改善待遇要求　資方未接受工潮僵持中</h3>
<p>虞洽卿路五六五號英商自來火公司、曾於本年四月十七日、全部職工、因向資方要求改善待遇、發生怠工風潮、旋經雙方諒解、圓滿解決、詎昨晨九時、該公司全體工人、突又發生怠工風潮、據平明社記者訪悉詳情如下、</p>
<p>怠工起因</p>
<p>據該公司工人語記者云、自本年四月間公司接受工人之要求後、工人因公司當局、並不履行條件義務、最近復藉故開除工人銅匠部工友楊漢章、因公司當局命銅匠間工友作其他之工作、而被工友拒絕、一部份工友、又鑒於際此米價高漲、曾於本月十七日用書面呈請工程師薩姆生、要求再增加工資、當被拒絕、故全體工人遂於昨晨九時起怠工、工潮在僵持中、</p>
<p>工人要求</p>

<h3>夫婦知識　獻給時代的丈夫們　愛情亦猶鬥爭</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士姚崇培　性病專科醫師詹念曾合著</p>
<p>（診所）北京路四川路口中國信託公司二樓</p>
<p>（時間）上午十時至下午六時　星期日休息</p>
<p>在這競爭劇烈的時代裏，到處表演着的無非是鬥爭狀態。什麽謙恭禮讓，這不過是弱者聊以自慰的呻吟。而也是强者藉以鎭壓弱者的美名詞。看吧！精力不濟的人，一個個都被淘汰了，尤其是精力不濟的男子，更難討老婆！這是最近的事實：有某君者，因恨其妻的水性楊花，與人犯奸，屢勸不改，乃憤而殺之，不久安發被拘。更有某君者，婚後數年，愛情尙稱融洽，因其妻時入舞塲歌榭，引得狂蜂浪蝶，遂漸視其夫如敝屣，因床第勃谿，丈夫頓萌厭世之念，乃偷海以自盡！至於其他由於妻之不貞，恨而別居離婚，出走自殺，捉姦殺妻者，在今日社會上更不一而足。人生何為而陷入此種慘境，天啊！這豈不是人類滔天的罪孽嗎？</p>
<p>其實，聰明的時代丈夫，對於水性楊花的妻子，也儘有比較好的方法可以應付。我們硏究女性的所以水性楊花？必為性生活的不滿足之故；或以性為工具，謀奪取生活資料，那末，人家可以給她滿足，為什麽她的丈夫不能給她滿足呢？至於以性為工具，這衣食的責任，丈夫應當負起。飢者思食，渴者思飲，性的飢渴時，就想另結私歡，這也是自然的道理。丈夫若身體强壯精力充足，頓時可把妻子引入歡暢境地，使她覺悟只有自己丈夫的可貴，則雖水性楊花的妻子，不難使她排除邪念，對丈夫盡具忠貞了。所以對待水性楊花的妻子最好的辦法，就是培植自己精力的充沛，在性生活上能勝過於她的情人，那她必死心塌地把整個身心都獻給了你，也許這種妻子是使你最幸福的，否則她將為的什麽？</p>
<p>可是男子若於早年犯有自凟遺精，或早婚縱慾，或尋花問柳，把主宰性能健康的生殖腺斵傷了，則凡滑精漏精，早洩陽萎，發育不全，精薄不育，神經衰弱等症，卽勢所難免。此種丈夫不特體貌不揚未老先衰，引不起妻子的愛戀，卽在夫婦生活上亦每曇花一現，或竟完全無能為力，這在熱情的妻子怎能不痛心疾首，夫婦間演出悲劇？欲謀補救必須根治其疾病。治療之法，據世界名醫及余經騐，均以服生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」最為對症特效。因此劑於服後一日夜間卽生精補腎，健腦活血，夏季連服，功效尤為確實而迅速。若連服一季，更可助長發育，滋養神經，不特上述各症可根本痊愈，更可延年益壽，返老還童。惟有遺精者，須兼服世界馳名治遺聖藥「希米脫氏固精片」（中西五洲等大藥房均售）以固精關，制止遺洩，收效尤速！</p>
<h3>遺精症必須及早治愈</h3>
<p>— 性病專科醫師詹念曾</p>
<p>聰明人防患于未然，普通人亡羊而補牢，若一再因循，知病而失治，終至自誤誤人者，這是世間最愚蠢的！靑年人智識未豐，意志薄弱，一時的好奇或被引誘，誤犯自凟，意淫，或同性戀愛等下賤行為。如能知過而改，尙可原諒！可是多數的靑年，一入其殼，卽流連忘返。致斲傷了性神經，鬆弛了精關，可怕的遺精症那就難以倖免。</p>
<p>一有遺精症，稍有理智者，即惕然覺悟了，則在遺精初期，治療較易着手，此時若服德國老牌治遺特效藥一希米脫氏固精片」，即可鞏固精關，鎭靜神經，必能收藥到症除之功。可是一般糊塗靑年，旣患遺精，而仍不以為意，經年累月，由遺精症象的惡化，變為滑精漏精者有之，因精枯血竭，爆發着腦衰健忘，失眠心悸，腰酸背痛，早洩陽萎，發育不全，未老先衰等症者那更比比皆是，此種靑年，必然面黃肌瘦，精力疲憊，遇事畏縮，志氣頹喪，為學生者，成績必不能及格，有留級與退學之　：從事於農工商之職業者，亦感難能勝任之苦，有失業的危險：在戀愛塲中更為女性所不喜，單戀，失戀，陷入人生慘境！如已結婚者，夫婦間有名無實，同床異夢，不特難諧魚水之歡，且有不育絕嗣的可能，茫茫前途，悲苦萬分！惟在今日醫學昌明時代，尙可補救，補救之法，除仍須積極服「希米脫氏固精片」外，更須兼服生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」以根本培補腦腎，精血及神經，繼續服用，必能於短期內治愈各症，益臻健康患者如能親來本診所施用電療，注射及手術等最新療法，更可保證痊愈。</p>
<p>健美</p>
<h3>乳峰是獲致幸福之媒介</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士姚崇培</p>
<p>除了窮鄉僻壤的十足「鄕曲」之外，現代男子的選擇配偶，他們無不以對方的「體格健全」為第一要着。他於面貌的如何？學問的怎樣？以及品行的如何？這不過是次要問題。此種見解，在我們醫學家的立塲看來，覺得很為扼要。蓋人生的整個事業，家庭安樂，以及子嗣的强弱，無不與體格有直接間接關係。如妻子的特個健全，那麼她不但可以幫助丈夫創業興家，即在夫婦之間的私生活上，她具有熱烈的濃情，亦可使丈夫快樂歡愉，精神上得到無限的快慰，家庭間充滿着喜氣，生育着伶俐的子女，其幸福必無量！</p>
<p>然則怎樣的女子，才算體格健全？關於這一點，有許多人還沒有充分認識，但在聰明的男子看來，這是一望而知的事情，蓋女性的體格健全與否，祗要看她們的乳臀兩部卽得，如女性的乳峰現高聳而有彈性狀態，臀部丯腴而圓潤者。即可斷知其生殖腺卵巢機能健全。新陳代謝作用旺盛，全身都充滿着新生細胞，自然體格健全，毫無疾病。反之如乳峯萎癟，臀部削瘦，健美喪失這便是患有月經不調，白帶不感，營養不良諸症。雖有如花如玉的面貌，亦為時代男子所鄙棄，其命運必非常悲慘！欲謀補救，祗有信賴科學，據中西名醫及余等經騐。均公認以服生殖腺卵採之成份，異常高貴，配製非巢製劑「女用生殖素」，最為對症而特效。蓋此劑所非常精良，故於服後一日夜間即可培補卵巢機能，旺盛新陳代謝作用，調整月經，消滅子宮一切疾患，若繼續服用，必可於短期內使乳峯高聳，臀部丯腴，增進健美，獲得無上幸福。</p>
<h3>鐵一般的事實</h3>
<p>— 性病專科醫師詹念曾錄</p>
<p>（一）遺精症着手回春</p>
<p>患者丁學文君，蘇北江都人，在某省校求學，因戰亂學校遷滬復課，丁君亦隨之來滬，年十九歲，尙未完全發育，因曾犯手淫，致性神經衰弱，精關鬆弛，爆發遺精症，一月約有二三次，初因不知利害，未加治療，詎於最近症象惡化，幾於每星期中必有遺精，致頭腦暈眩，健忘失眠，求學殊感困難，稍事行走，且有腰酸背痛，倦怠萬分，殆臥病不起，（上皆自訴）上月來本診所診治，余細察其病狀後，與所言相符，即囑其在中西大藥房購服治遺聖藥「希米脫氏固精片」及腦腎與神經系大補劑生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」。固精片以鞏固其精關。制止其遺洩，「生殖素」則專事培補腦腎及神經，並施以電療注射，以輔助其功效，三法並施，一月於茲，果然百病霍然，健康倍增。</p>
<p>（二）腦弱腎虧幾誤終生</p>
<p>褚玉山君本地人年二十六歲，結婚巳三年，近忽爆發早洩陽萎，腦衰失眠諸症，新秋良夜，牀第間時起勃　之聲，褚君任某公司會計，亦有難能勝任之苦，茫茫前途，彌深憂戚！　乃就治於余，余用標本兼治法，先囑其購服「生殖素」以補腎生精，健腦活血，繼施以電療注射，至今甫一月有半，巳覺精力豐足，愛情圓滿，面頰紅潤，辦事不倦，與前巳判若兩人矣！</p>

<h3>投機失所愚藉　金市波動日微</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、仍屬平穩、雖隔昨收後潛勢頗疲、但本日毫無影響、多戶額手慶幸、反於低時拉進、故價始終盤桓於五千二百元之上、晨開為五千二百三十元、後會微跌、而經錢兌業銀號力購後、卽高達五千二百七十元、嗣為證券幫錢兌業復出、重跌至五千二百元地盤、午收為五千二百十元、後市初為五千二百二十五元、銀號傾向出售、價不支吿撳二十元、卒賴證券幫錢兌業略吸、維持五千二百二十元收盤、為時甚早、乃談論交易者缺乏故也、結果較上日軋跌二十元、全天交易零多躉少、約做開二千兩光景、銀樓飾金未動、海關金等仍平、</p>
<p>烚赤再跌念元</p>
<p>自晨每條（食糧）、初以滙市微鬆、價較上日收市略挫、首由金號對做二十兩、為五千二百三十元、嗣因錢兌業等吐賣、再跌十五元、錢兌業出金號十兩、遜為五千二百十五元、旋幸某錢兌業乘賤猛吸、且斯時金號及銀號幫亦根之扒進、不久遂漲起五十五元、金號對做二十兩、升爲五千二百七十元、不意此後某錢兌業忽獲利回吐、市勢復向下游、而證券幫亦轉懷賣意、再加銀號幫接踵吐出、竟步跌七十元、銀號出金號等共五十兩、退為五千二百元、午刻某錢兌業趁低復來收買、遂吿回升二十元、午後某錢兌業首來搜買、卽被抬高十五元、錢兌業進金號十兩、為五千二百二十五元、嗣銀號互做十兩、為五千二百〇五元、入後錢兌業與某證券幫先後撈進、遂步高十五元、證券幫進銀號等數十兩、為五千二百二十元、作晚收價、結果比上日續跌二十元、全天七十元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤較高十數元、收進减低三十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十餘元、均鮮做開、</p>
<p>飾金鎭日不動</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、終日未更、大同行仍懸五百四十元、新同行與上價相仿、收進减低三十元光景、</p>
<h3>外幣略漲</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市况、英美金磅跌後回平、英金票稍有需要、市價略漲、美金票不脫盤勢、初做十六元一角二分、繼而步漲至二角半、晚市又退為十六元一角八分、但比上日仍好八分、香港票需求者尙眾、市價略漲一分、日金票仍不乏供給者、市價續跌八厘、晚市為一元二角一分二厘、朝鮮票潛勢仍挺、晚市續升至一元零三分、</p>
<h3>貼現軋小一元</h3>
<p>昨匯劃票據貼現率、略見下低、每千元上午貼進四十八元、貼出約五十元、下午退至四十九元、貼近四十七元、比上日軋小一元、錢業公會拆息未更、早午兩市均掛一角八公分、</p>
<h3>證劵　內債頻跌</h3>
<p>昨日統一公債暗盤市况、因消息不良、人心更為忐忑、市氣再度萎靡、跌勢益覺有勁、是以買氣衰頹、似有空頭佔上風之勢、故市價下瀉幾無回顧之象、當晨間開出、雖市卽呈疲軟、但以十四號久豐信昌聯益等均有收進、故所降尙微、入後突以恒孚同裕德孚同康等力塞不怠、價遂絡繹下墮、午後市氣較淸、惟走勢依然不振、蓋因六號樂茂二十號同順鴻大等相繼吐售、勢復下傾、旋幸久豐同裕聯和聯益信孚逢低吸收、遂略見拉高、全日上落、結果一致續跌二角五分至半元不等、成交尙暢、約一百三十餘萬元强、茲列簡明表如左、</p>
<p>眾業公所報吿、週末了結之股、被吸甚易、收盤各股潛勢堅穩、設消息不變、下週市况或有轉强之望、</p>
<p>倫敦十八日（週四）電、今日遠東英商公司股票掛牌行市、匯豐銀行續見上升、英倫註册股升二鎊、香港註册股升一股、價均為六十八鎊、其餘不動、</p>
<p>倫敦十八日（週四）電、今日中國外債掛牌行市仍吿平穩、上下檔各債劵槪無變動、</p>
<h3>糧食　汕頭幫進大批路米　香港又來一萬包行情跌後回高不易</h3>
<p>昨日洋米市先疲後緊、行情因早市所跌巳多、結果未能復原、蓋晨間初開、作客不前、客販求脫、各色洋米又落元半、然後方見活動、行情隨之回昂、但市面久疲、人心不健、一動卽懈、收盤統計一伏一起、較之前日收價猶小半元光景、一號陳西貢為五十二元、五十一元半、一號暹羅五十四元半、五十四元、火絞五十四元、五十三元半、小絞五十二元二角、東京　尖四十八愿、次至四十五元半、特四十九元、糙尖四十三元二角、四十三元、碎尖四十一元、三十八元半、米菉四十二三元、眞特別四十四元、路貨早市瀉落二元三四角、繼又回好一元許、結果祗小元許、初因力弱心虛之行號求脫於前、浮囤散戶貶脫於後、二號西貢米六月下七月上祗開五十八元半、後則喊高未妥、而二號暹米六月二十裝早市小至五十八元八角、比前收猛跌二元四角、二十六裝亦開五十八元八角較小二元二角、乃汕頭幫趁此疲檔突起猛扒、不同二十裝二十六號裝一味貪進、二十裝乃自五十九元五十九元二三角大至六十元、二十六號則自五十九元五十九元三五角大至六十元零三角頓時回好一元二角及一元半、比之前收祗較小一元二角及七角而已、而成交數共達一千四五百噸、大部份由汕頭拉進、惟該幫是否收現付運、尚無表示云、</p>
<p>洋米不斷而來、昨日又有太古公司湖北輪自香港運來一萬零零二包、下午二時許抵滬、當停靠浦東本行碼頭起卸、（祖）粳糯國米來源、仍祗粳貨到千來包、傳聞明暗交易似屬供求相仿、所以售價未起變化、常幫特淸粳六十六七元、眞特粳六十八元、蘇崑常州白粳高自六十五元次至宿熱六十元左右、靑泗薄稻六十五六元至六十三四元、南港早稻鮮六十二三元次宿六十元、斛見鮮五十九元、宿五十七八員、金溧特元六十二三元、常丹白元六十一元半至六十元零二角、香港白元六十元五十九元云、</p>
<h3>粉麥沉靜</h3>
<p>麵粉　昨日粉市、頗為沉靜、華廠方面、自福新廠恢復開車後、各廠均能普遍供應、惟廠盤已達十六元、洋米售價每石五十五元、似乎粉比米價為高、故實銷未免减退、且各粉號零售、搭售內地日廠粉者、亦逐漸眾多、致市面環境、益難看好、統市華廠批出約有五千餘包、强生粉亦開四五百包、其餘包、强生粉亦開四五百包、其餘內地雜牌與鳳凰牌的等、均在擯持之中、</p>
<p>小麥　昨交易亦吿沉靜、虹口到貨、尙不寂寞、而運入租界者、終屬零星小數、蓋華廠採運證迄未發出進胃亦甚懈怠、日廠吃盤亦苛、致新交易無形淸淡、市面前途、亦同時看小、</p>

<p>雜糧交易、因運銷兩途受人拑制、致去路無大批成交、市塲中祗見少數做開、昨市蠶豆雖有三票交易、但為數不滿六百包、銷塲仍祗本街零星走化、計妥交吳江靑皮蠶豆二百餘包、價為二十二元、北港靑皮蠶豆二百八十餘包、價為二十元零七角至四角、閔行靑皮蠶豆一百餘包、價為十九元而巳、</p>
<h3>紗花　實銷廖落　沙市虛弱</h3>
<p>紗市呆滯無特色、市塲交易大為淸寂、此因欺負範圍殊狹、以致投機者目標全無、難以下手、所以成交甚少、市面當然缺乏變遷矣、同時實際銷路亦寥落、惟同業大都在多頭地位、拋賣者極不願意的、因此情况、遂成僵持之局、</p>
<p>現紗晨開氣勢非常渙散、因外匯亦在水平綫上而無多大進出、惟外棉又向下風、故人心較挫、二十支　馬開價為九百三十五元、但價格稍低後、一般略為買兩包、又回升至九百四十五元、惟塲上交易甚稀、收盤價為九百四十元、收盤以後稍有謠言、人氣更虛、查　半日間成交統計一千〇五十包、行情二十支雙馬跌四元、茲將各幫口買去之額量、今日有紗一百八十五件運烟臺、又七十件運香港、分別如左、</p>
<p>同行　七八〇　香港　二二〇</p>
<p>福州　四〇　內地　一〇</p>
<p>統計　一、〇五〇</p>
<h3>棉市杳無生色</h3>
<p>現棉交易、依然不旺、此因美棉又向下風、印棉狀况亦屬平　無奇、至於棉紗銷路缺乏、而市價不穩、所以廠房缺乏興奮氣象、偶有成交、數量亦微乎其微也、市面無甚生色、</p>
<p>另訊、外棉市價紐約棉市、昨日殊為靜寂、續後稍因現貨商之賣出、及一部分之多頭了結、結果收盤價格較之上日跌落十餘磅音、印度市况平靜、昨日連同預測無甚軒輊、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、昨日雖較靜寂、但廠方尙有辦額之交易、點輟棉市、然市上存底不豐、棉市可無大跌面、故各同業之心思、頗堅定也、</p>
<h3>糖市　洋糖上落無定</h3>
<p>昨糖市趨勢平平、上落無多、公會劃盤、現貨二四粗白本棧貨六十七元半、不動、外棧貨上午六十七元二角至一角半、下午六十七元、小四角、轉口貨五十三元至五十二元九角、省一二角、太古車白B　西棧七十六元五角、勝二角、HX　七十四元半、荷赤五十八元、本廠雪白六十七元半、一號冰八十八元半、晶明冰為九十元、國糖聞普通雜路靑略有　出、價乏上落、</p>
<h3>南北貨　核桃桃肉俱升</h3>
<p>核桃近有存貨運到一批、正在談價、尙未開出、行盤手揀桃升五元、為八十五元、普通濟南桃仍六十元、桃肉亦升五元、為一百九十元、</p>
<h3>粉干續降</h3>
<p>綫粉干近以各帮去化淸寂、復見下降、如龍口粉為一百〇八元、降去七元、靑島八十五元、降五元、湯粉到到銷兩稀、無甚上落、其勢須俟秋凉動銷、方有轉企之望、</p>
<h3>甜杏猛降</h3>
<p>甜杏仁近以去化呆滯、上中檔俱少交易、如北山杏開過三百三四十元、（劃幣行盤、前為三百八十元、現售三百十元、降去七十元、</p>
<h3>煤炭印煤滿坑滿谷　實銷反見呆滯</h3>
<p>印度　答烟煤、本週自大批湧到以来、浦东西各棧房、均　得滿坑滿谷、為戰後少有現象、而本街工廠實銷不動、客帮去胃、又遭　梗、故行情步降、趨勢益軟、某行暗盤　統煤棧單二百十元、亦鮮受主、本街門莊、篩塊每噸兩百四十元、送到客戶行抗在內、盤子亦巳改小、</p>
<h3>雜項　香烟行市仍堅</h3>
<p>連日香烟暗盤行情仍健、雖有三戶賣出、因同業胃口頗暢、以致市面緊俏、執有大英牌者獲利脫手、行情比前小十七元、昨開大　牌一千零零八元、品海牌六百八十元、老刀牌新貨七百五十七元、老貨小二十元、為七百三十七元、小仙女本埠貨四百八十元、五華牌、廠方開售箱額不多、市面緊俏、價為五百三十元、少數賣出、不敷市銷、（增）</p>
<h3>統計　物價之變動　—六月份—</h3>
<p>— 慧</p>
<p>六月份上海的物價，照理在外匯鬆長下，必趨低落，然而事實所顯示，却不是這樣，據工部局發表的工人生活指數報告，總指數為四二二·九一，較上月份外匯劇縮下，還要超過四十，（卽三八二·九一）也就是空前的指數，主要的原因，山於米價的劇漲所致，於是一般的物價，得以支持而不下跌，這在分類指數中可得到明證，就是食物類指數，由五月份三八三·二四，陡升至四五一·七四，雜項類所增有限，衣着與燃料兩類，均吿下降，</p>
<p>六月份在報上刋登漲價工商廠號來統計，共為三十八起，比較上月份减少九十六起，就中漲價的起數要以交通運輸業為最多，計為十三起，佔首位，飮食業與電氣金屬業各四起第二位，文化業日用品業裝飾業各三起第三位，醫藥業土木業包裝業燭箔業各二起殿　位，再就三十八起漲價來分析其商品類別，計有二十四種，內以飮食品及交通運輸品各四種佔首位，日用品及電氣金屬品各三種第二位，文化品醫藥品包裝燭箔品各二種第三位，土木品及裝飾品各一種殿末，茲分述於下、</p>
<p>（一）冷飲品　冰磚每塊漲售一元六角，冰結漣甜杯售五角，大紫雪糕每塊五角，白雪公主太極妃每條五角，小紫雪糕每塊二角五分，冰精每支一角，（海寗洋行）　（未完）</p>

<p>捕蝗古法</p>
<p>由上年遺落之蝗子，春夏之交，破卵而出，當其來也，勢驟而不可遏，飛行蔽天，日光幾為之黑。其所止之處，似有定嚮，或過境而不停，或棲田而不食，或肆齧於野，秧苗殆盡，一若冥冥之中，陰有驅遣之者，農人遇之，束手無策，惟有臨畦歎息，委諸天災而已。然地方官治民之事，不得不引為己憂，設法以捕之。其法大要有三端：曰初生之時，挖掘蝗子，豫絕其根株，勿使蠢動也。曰令民間小兒婦人輩，四鄕搜捕，送縣價買，當堂澆死，或焚以薪，由官捐廉給價，使鄕人勤捕之，鄕人因有小利可獲，則眾起捉捕，蝗之患，亦可弭也。曰蝗之初至，未集於田，急用火焚之，傳齊諸役，會點營兵，下鄕搜捕，必盡殲之而後已，此不藉民力也。然此三者，雖皆可以淸蝗患，而或當飛蔽天日，散集四野之時，正有不能盡捕之勢。其繼也，或雷電大風，一時吹去，或羣飛渡水，盡行淹溺，因而秋收尙可無礙，則此亦天意之不絕民食而後至此。</p>

<p>小談</p>
<h3>不義之財</h3>
<p>— 編者</p>
<p>文子先生來信，說有朋友某君，在某公司供職，月入甚微，在物價驚人高漲下，完全靠過去積蓄的有限血汗來貼補一家數口費用。現有賭博機關裏的朋友，願代謀掛名差使，月入可以維持生活及兒女敎育費。可是某君『認爲這是不勞而獲，受之有愧，且爲不義之財，更於良心有虧，人格有損，」因此有點躊躇；但轉念一想，『旣不代他們做事，而且在不義的油水中分潤一點也不爲過，何况大可有助於善良份子的生活及年靑一代的敎育費。」因此遲疑不決，要我們發表意見。</p>
<p>我們以爲這個世界可分爲光明與黑暗兩大陣營，這兩個陣營的勢力，一直在激鬥着。世界上的人不參加光明的工作，就得參加黑暗的工作，決無中立或騎牆的可能。</p>
<p>旣是從不義的地方來的，就是不義之財，旣是不義之財，無論用到甚麽地方去，加上甚麼花巧的名目，也還是不義之財。敎育子女的地方，不一定限於學校；父母的一舉一動，便是最根本的敎育範本。如果先把『不勞而獲』和『取不義之財』的毒素注入兒女腦中，再叫他們去受學校敎育，對於社會，結果害多於利；如果兒女『有知』，一定情願失學。</p>
<p>孟老夫子說得好，一生我所欲也，義亦我所欲也；二者不可得兼，捨生而取義！』何况這還不是生死關頭的問題。</p>
<p>醫學</p>
<h3>毒瘤</h3>
<p>— 曹靈佑</p>
<p>談到了毒瘤瘤（Cancer）大家也許會談虎色變。這也不能見怪，因爲毒瘤是常常會致人於死命的，特別是那些上了相當年紀的人，更多因爲生了毒瘤，不能醫治而死去！在今日科學昌明的美國，據統計起來，每年也有十五萬多的人死於毒瘤之下，除因心臟致死外，毒瘤可說是致人於死命的第一位兇手了。</p>
<p>爲什麽有這許多人死於毒瘤之下呢？難道毒瘤是一種不能醫治的毛病嗎？毒瘤不像流行性感冒等疾病，是因爲傳染而來，亦不是因有某種的病菌在作祟而致。毒瘤的成因，可說是由於有毒性的無次序的細胞，在患者本身的體素內，繼續的不斷生長而成！它最使人討厭的一點，就是在早期的毒瘤，往往沒有特殊的病微顯露出來，直至毒瘤在患者的身上擴大至相當程度，給人發現了，那時可說是太遲，非獨沒有法子把毒瘤取出，體內的瘤細胞更會因而傳至別部份去，結果死神終於降臨了。</p>
<p>假如我們平時常常注意自已的身體，無論身體那部份有些不適，就立刻去找醫生，請他替你全身檢查，假如身體有毒瘤存在的話，就不難發現出來，假如發現了是早期的毒瘤，憑今日的醫學力量，是有治愈的希望的。</p>
<p>直至目前爲止，醫生對於早期的毒瘤治療的方法只有兩種：第一種是用鐳或愛克司光綫把毒瘤燒去。第二種是施行手術把毒瘤割去。</p>
<p>我們應用什麽的方法，來防禦毒瘤的生長呢？除與醫生合作，常常行健康檢查外，身體上面部，皮膚，口，舌，齒等均須常常保持淸潔，更不要吃那些令你感覺不舒暢的食物，要練習自制的力量，不要飲過量的酒，不要吸太多的香烟，更應免除長久的便秘。</p>
<p>毒瘤可說是常年通行，酷烈無比！每年因此而死去的人不可以數計，假如你有了合理的豫防，那你就可以免致重蹈不必要的死命！</p>

<h3>失眠夜</h3>
<p>— 徐翊</p>
<p>先生，你也曾在炎炎的夏夜患過失眠嗎？那種畸零人所特有的經騐，也祗有親嘗過失眠滋味的畸零人所能懂得的呢</p>
<p>在籠子似的斗室中，在四周鼾聲的交織裏，在黑色魔手的控制下，而自己張着無力的眼睛，體會那失眠的滋味，找尋那失去了的舊夢，像那個古時的漁子摸索桃源仙境的舊徑一樣。</p>
<p>而我也正太像那位漁人了，我終於被擯棄在睡鄕外，悠悠地，讓一種獨特的「顧念」阻塞住了我的去路。</p>
<p>我不能把這個「顧念」去除，我也不想把這個「顧念」棄掉，所以我一直是站在陲鄕之外，我一直是醒着；雖然我也知道睡鄕是有着怎樣的舒適與安樂。</p>
<p>黑夜的庇護下，臭蟲大胆地吸着人們的血，人們是漸漸地消瘦了，吸血的蟲却迅速地肥胖起來，而且加倍地蕃殖，蕃殖得滿室都是只知道吸人血的傢伙！</p>
<p>這種可怕的事情，却只有患着失眠的人知道了；而困在夢鄕的人，只多也不過下意識地蠕動幾下而已。</p>
<p>翻一佩身，四周仍充滿着無知的鼾聲；我張着眼睛，我依然張着眼睛。對於這漆黑的失眠夜，我落入於無底的悲哀裏。</p>
<p>先生，你也曾在炎炎的夏夜患過失眠嗎？那種畸零人所特有的經騐，也祗有親嘗過失眠滋味的畸零人所能懂得的呢</p>
<p>霍桑探案</p>
<h3>舞後面的歸宿</h3>
<p>— 程小青著</p>
<p>第三章　對立的情報</p>
<p>霍桑仍自額自地問：「你爲什麼昨天一個人到外面去吃夜飯？」老毛理直氣壯地答道：「這自然有緣故的。昨夜我因爲要去看戲，這裏的夜飯總要八點鐘光景，戲院裏開塲很早，我自然等不及。所以我在七點鐘光景就出去，先到正與館吃了夜飯，接着便到天聲舞台去。昨夜裏天聲舞台演的全本鐵公鷄，那佈景和機關精彩得很。你如果不相信，我的房裏還有一張戲目單。我去拿來。」他旋轉身子好像要走出去。</p>
<p>霍桑止住他道：「慢來，你暫時不要去拿。我問你，你昨夜裏怎麼興緻這樣高，竟會一個人去看戲？」</p>
<p>老毛道：「這不關我的興緻高不高，王小姐送給我一張戲票，我才去看的。」</p>
<p>霍桑的眼光忽又閃了一閃，似乎又在無意中發現了什麼綫索。他吸了兩口烟，定了定神，仍保持着常態，繼續發問。</p>
<p>「這戲票是王小姐送給你的嗎？伊可是常常有戲票送給你的？」老毛道：「不能說常常，昨夜是第二次。上禮拜天夜裏，伊也送過我一張。」你可知道伊的戲票那裏來的？是不是人家送給伊的？」</p>
<p>老毛又皺着眉峯，像又難於回答的樣子。「這個我不仔細。不過昨天的一張，好像—「好像什麽？」</p>
<p>「好像伊特地買來的。因爲在昨天下午三點鐘光景，有一個人騎了脚踏車送一封信來。那是我接進去的，信封裏硬硬的像是一張戲票。」</p>
<p>「可會付錢？」</p>
<p>「沒有。伊什麼戲館裏都有熟人，打電話買戲票，向來用不着馬上付錢。那封信送到了半個鐘頭後，王小姐就下樓來把戲票給我。」</p>
<p>「那時伊向你說什麽？」</p>
<p>老毛搖頭道：「沒有說什麼，伊祗說：『今夜裏家裏沒有事，你出去散散罷。』我當然也很高興地接受了。」（五〇）</p>
<h3>新</h3>
<p>— 楊化時</p>
<p>把舊的一切都埋葬吧，我們追求着新的！</p>
<p>新是世界上最美麗的，這是宇宙的生命，牠蘊藏着偉大的，純潔的，光明的元素，牠驅走了卑劣的，煩惱的，黑暗的一切。</p>
<p>前進的人，都應在新的裏面發掘，牠使我們走上一條寬坦的大路，牠替我們打退了「成功的敵人」。</p>
<p>時代的洪流中有一股力量，使人們愛着新，世界上的一切，都在進步着，一日比一日更新，有誰能滿足自己的一切呢？盡善盡美是人們希望的，不呼吸新鮮的空氣，人們便會病倒，不在新的裏面尋求，人們是要落伍的。</p>
<p>有人說：人們的生活要和「新」接近，才不會感到寂寞，苦悶，才能有完美的成就。</p>
<p>努力走向新的道路吧，不要迷戀舊日的一切，過着腐朽的舒適的麻醉的生活，這是要毀滅的，我們不怕困難，努力改進，努力創造，增强我們的力量。</p>
<p>朋友，請記着，我們要得到新的滋養，才能充實生命的價値。</p>
<h3>尼尼微城的悔改</h3>
<p>尼尼微是古代亞述的首都，在文化，商業，政治，經濟上，居於領導的地位，惜乎充滿罪惡，　行種種污穢，以致毀滅自己，得罪上主。一個沒有蒙神救贖的罪人，他的心就是一座尼尼微城，裏面所充滿的，無非是些：「惡念，兇殺，姦淫，苟合，偷盜，妄証，和謗　……」。</p>
<p>尼尼微惡貫滿盈，神只有兩個方策可以對付。一個是秉公行義，按罪處決，滅絕那城。一個呢？施行憐憫，不罪旣往，拯救那城。神是愛，捨不得那城的滅亡，差先知約拿去宣佈祂的救法。照樣，你這沒有蒙神救贖的人，也只有兩個歸宿，（一）按罪滅亡，（二）因信得救。但我不願你不知道你的罪雖像硃紅丹顏一般，神還愛你，神要救你。祂差自己的獨生子耶穌基督降世，正是爲要拯救罪人。</p>
<p>尼尼微聽到了約拿宣佈的救法，就信服神，披蔴蒙灰，爲罪傷痛，禁食禱告，求神饒恕。他們更也離去惡行，丟棄強暴，表示他們真的悔改。神一見他們真的悔改了，就寬容他們，救了尼尼微。基督耶穌比約拿還大，祂不單宣傳救恩，目爲我們的罪釘死在十字架上，死後三日復活，四十日升天，現在在神右邊仍爲你我代求。你願脫去罪惡的刑罰，蒙神的拯救麼。眞心悔改，接受耶穌基督做你的救主就得了。今天就是你當悔改的日子，因爲明天是屬你的不是，你還不知道。朋友們！醒來吧！</p>

<h3>李綺年　昨自港啓程　定二十二日抵達上海</h3>
<p>— 菱</p>
<p>中國電影界人材寥落，急需補充新人，這是大家承認的；所以近年各影業公司訪求新人，不遺餘力，像新華公司崛起的陳雲裳，就是在這假原則下，光芒照射在整個的銀國。</p>
<p>最近，藝華公司宣傳多時的李綺年，正和陳雲裳一樣，也是著譽港島的銀星，李綺年雖則沒有在上海，使觀衆發生深刻的認識，腦膜上却都留有印象了的。</p>
<p>幾次的宣傳來滬，結果總是沒有證實，但是，記者昨從可靠方面，獲到了一個確實的消息，就是李綺年已於昨日，搭荷蘭郵船芝沙尼加號離港，預計二十二日可以抵達上海。</p>
<p>據藝華公司宣稱：現在暫定金門飯店，作爲李綺年的寓處，然後再覓適當的住宅。至於將由李綺年中演的影片，亦已決定二部，一是古裝，一是時裝，片名則暫守秘密。</p>

<h3>胡蓉蓉脫熟悉影圈</h3>
<p>— 星</p>
<p>在目前，吾國電影界很缺少童星，除了陳娟娟，嚴鳳凰，胡蓉蓉之外，似乎沒有了，有之，祇一牟菱，但牟菱已脫離影圈多時了。</p>
<p>陳娟娟現在新華拍戲，嚴鳳凰則在國華工作，而唯有胡蓉蓉，至今還在動盪之中，前一個時期，國聯及國華兩公司，都一度與蓉蓉的父兄接洽過有意邀她拍戲，但當時，蓉蓉的父兄因為她身子有些不適，所以都婉拒了。</p>
<p>昨日記者因有些小事，到胡蓉蓉的府上去，會見她的父兄胡紹虞及胡心靈，記者很隨便的問起蓉蓉的拍戲事，究竟作何打算？</p>
<p>「由於今日電影事業趨向於民間故事的低級題材，我們對於電影，似乎很感痛心，允其是，現在電影商相互間的明爭暗鬥，實在是不該有的現象，所以我們對於蓉蓉的拍戲，不預備再讓她繼續下去，……」這是紹虞先生的話。</p>
<p>「……對於影迷們，認爲拍影戲是一件再榮譽不過的事，但在幹過水銀燈生活的人，那是覺得和幹別的事一樣的淡然，因此我與家父會一度商量過，將永遠不再使蓉蓉度銀幕生活了」胡心　說。</p>
<p>「那麼蓉蓉本人，是否愛好拍電影？</p>
<p>「其實，孩子是無所謂的，她根本不明瞭拍電影是好還是壞，我們的觀察，她對於電影，似乎也沒有濃厚的興趣」</p>
<p>這樣說來，蓉蓉是準不冉活躍在銀幕上了。</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops Forcibly Land at Hengshan Wharf in Xiangshan Port, Repulsed by Chinese Forces; Another Detachment Attempts to Cross the Fuchun River to Invade Southward, Foiled; Transportation Between Ningbo and the Interior Remains Unobstructed</h3>
<p>A Certain Location in Eastern Zhejiang: Three Japanese warships sailed from Zhenhai to Xiangshan Port, launching numerous motorboats filled with Japanese soldiers, attempting a forced landing at Hengshan Wharf in Xiangshan Port. After a brave counterattack by Chinese troops, the Japanese suffered heavy casualties and retreated back to their ships. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Jinhua: On the morning of the 19th, many Japanese boats, fully loaded with Japanese soldiers, attempted to land at Hengshan Wharf but were repulsed by Chinese troops. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>A Certain Location in Eastern Zhejiang: As of noon on the 19th, the battle in the Zhenhai area continued fiercely in the coastal region. The Japanese, who landed in succession, encountered significant setbacks and were extremely panicked. Chinese troops are currently intensifying their fierce attacks. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>A Certain Location in Eastern Zhejiang: The Japanese attempt to secretly cross the Fuchun River from Fuyang to invade southward was thwarted at Xiaoshali, Dongzhou Sandbar. They then attempted to land on Zhongzhou (an islet in the river) at the western end of Dongzhou Sandbar, but were again repulsed by Chinese troops. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: This afternoon, a Chinese military spokesman, while hosting news reporters, provided detailed information on Japanese naval actions on the Zhejiang coast and the Anglo-Japanese negotiations regarding the Burma Road. He also urged all nations to take effective measures to restrain Japan, otherwise Japan would accelerate its southward expansion. The spokesman stated, regarding military actions in the Ningbo area, that the gain or loss of certain cities and ports would not affect the overall situation of the Sino-Japanese War. Currently, transportation between Ningbo and the interior remains unobstructed. (Reuters Dispatch, 19th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Japanese Expansion of Blockade and the Shanghai Market</h3>
<p>According to the statistics released by the Jianghai Customs, there was a trade surplus in the first six months of this year. At first glance, this seems to be evidence of a prosperous market. However, in reality, we cannot be so optimistic. The value of imports is calculated in Customs Gold Units based on the official exchange rate of the Central Bank, which is 2.707 legal tender yuan per Customs Gold Unit. Therefore, the resulting figure is smaller than the figure calculated using the black market exchange rate. On the other hand, the increase in the value of exports is indeed affected by the rising prices caused by the compression of the black market exchange rate, so it is relatively large. Thus, comparing two items calculated using incommensurate units results in a surplus of 250 million yuan. If the value of imports were also converted using the black market exchange rate, the magnitude of the trade deficit would be apparent from the table below.</p>
<p>Calculation Method	Legal Tender Value of Imports Calculated According to…	Surplus or Deficit After Comparison with Export Value</p>
<p>(1) Official Exchange Rate of Customs Gold Units as Quoted by the Central Bank: 2.707 yuan	385,553,599	Surplus of 251,898,971</p>
<p>(2) Black Market Exchange Rate of British Pounds Converted to Customs Gold Units: 9.75 yuan	1,388,676,605	Deficit of 751,224,035</p>
<p>(3) Black Market Exchange Rate of U.S. Dollars Converted to Customs Gold Units: 11 yuan	1,566,712,070	Deficit of 929,259,500</p>
<p>(Note) The value of imports is 142,428,370 Customs Gold Units, and the value of exports is 637,452,570 yuan. Comparisons are made after conversion.</p>
<p>If we use the black market exchange rate, calculating with British pounds, it turns into a deficit of 750 million yuan. If we use U.S. dollars, the deficit reaches as high as 930 million yuan. Is it truly justified to call this "an improvement in foreign trade"? With the war dragging on for years, the trade deficit is still so large. One can imagine that the people of Shanghai are still indulging in ease and pleasure, unable to change their extravagant habits, only seeking foreign goods.</p>
<p>Now, Japan is both forcing Britain and France to yield and strengthen the blockade on the passageways through Burma and Vietnam to the Southwest, and also using its naval forces to blockade sea transport from Hangzhou Bay to Quanzhou. From now on, China will have no other route besides transport through the Northwest to the Soviet Union. The inland regions will feel even more isolated from the outside world, and Shanghai's commerce and industry will lack opportunities for vitality. In reality, profit and loss are always intertwined and cannot be viewed in isolation. We must recognize that the result of a tight blockade is that the material lives of the Chinese people will inevitably become more difficult, and the trade of various countries with China will also suffer significant losses, with the United States being the most affected. This will stimulate the international community to react against the aggressor, and inform the international community to strengthen the advocacy of the Open Door Policy, which will inevitably form an important factor that will benefit the future overall situation. This is the first point. While cutting off incoming goods, they are also plugging the leaks. This is the second point. The difficulty of obtaining materials is a natural phenomenon for the time being. However, it is a certainty that this will stimulate inland production and promote the completion of the self-sufficiency policy. This is the third point. Recently, the goods that have infiltrated the inland regions from the coast of Zhejiang and Fujian have included very few Western goods and very few domestic goods, but a large number of domestic goods that have been disguised. In the future, Japanese warships will prohibit this on their own initiative. This is the fourth point. Customs revenue is falling into the hands of the Japanese and will only be used by them. From now on, it will be sharply reduced. This is the fifth point. With these five points, it is not necessary to view the blockade as an extremely vicious measure by the enemy. The method for dealing with the blockade is to endure the temporary suffering and do everything possible to create a lasting foundation and open up a vast new world.</p>
<p>Furthermore, focusing on Shanghai alone, during the blockade of the ports of Fujian and Zhejiang, foreign trade will inevitably show a significant decline compared to the first half of the year, regardless of whether it is a trade deficit or a trade surplus. The people of Shanghai indulge in ease and pleasure, and are extravagant, which is only a minor reason for creating a large total import and export trade volume. The main reason is that Shanghai has not lost its status as a major port for import and export, and the Shanghai market benefits from this import and export. After the blockade of Fujian and Zhejiang, Shanghai will at least lose the commercial benefits of the two provinces of Fujian and Zhejiang. Moreover, the ports of Fujian and Zhejiang are not only the gateways to the two provinces of Fujian and Zhejiang. Guangdong, Jiangxi, Hunan, Guangxi, and even Sichuan are all connected through Fujian and Zhejiang, and the number of passengers and goods traveling back and forth is considerable. This is evidenced by the fact that before the blockade, ships sailed back and forth between Shanghai and Fujian and Zhejiang. Therefore, the total throughput that Shanghai will reduce in the future far exceeds what is produced and sold in the provinces of Fujian and Zhejiang. Given this, what will be the impact on the Shanghai market?</p>
<p>Forced by circumstances, the Shanghai market will inevitably decline gradually, and the losses will be shared by both China and foreign countries. From the perspective of the overall situation, this has no great significance. The proportion of Shanghai in the overall situation has gradually decreased over the past three years. After the Shanghai market declines, the proportion will decrease even further. Even if the decline is so extreme that it is considered almost equal to zero, it is still acceptable. However, for the people of Shanghai, they must not view themselves as redundant growths and sit idly by as the end comes. For the sake of today, there are three essential things: first, urgently transfer funds to the inland areas as much as possible to engage in production, in order to seek compensation and development; second, all industries, and even every household, should tighten up and save as much as possible in order to stabilize their livelihoods and extend the period of maintaining vitality; third, curb improper price gouging and rent increases, and make them as low as possible in order to seek a way of understanding and mutual assistance. I would especially like to respectfully advise the Shanghai business community that it must be aware that Shanghai in the future is definitely not what it used to be. In all business operations, you must change your mindset, change your perspective, and set new directions to adapt to the times. Otherwise, if a small business fails, or if the entire city is panicked, it will be unavoidable.</p>
<h3>Regarding the British Blockade of the Burma Road, the U.S. Government Deeply Disappointed; the U.S. Fleet Stationed in Hawaii Sufficient to Increase Chinese Courage; American Residents in the Philippines Telegraph Request for Strong Policy Adoption</h3>
<p>Washington - Secretary of State Hull yesterday declined to comment to reporters on Prime Minister Churchill's Wednesday confirmation to the public of the Burma Road blockade. However, most correspondents in Washington felt a deep impression that the majority of the U.S. government was deeply disappointed by Britain's action. Hull claimed that he would not criticize until he received the official text of Churchill's speech. Observers believe this is the only way to avoid direct conflict with the British Prime Minister, but Hull had previously expressed strong protests on this matter twice. Government officials were not deeply impressed by Britain's conflation of the Burma Road blockade with the promotion of peace between China and Japan, but they similarly refused to criticize it. Neutral observers believe that a fair peace is currently unlikely to arise, as China still has inexhaustible strength to continue resisting and will never easily accept Japan's conditions based on compensating for the losses of the past three years. Those close to the government do not pay excessive attention to the Anglo-Japanese agreement, as the road is fundamentally impassable during the three months of the blockade due to the rainy season. They say that during these three months, Britain will demonstrate its strength to resist the German offensive, and by then, Britain will be in a better position to renegotiate the Burma Road issue with Japan. These people also say that if Britain does not succumb to Germany after three months, it will triumph in Europe, at which time Japan will not threaten Britain again in East Asia. At the same time, they admit that the Burma Road blockade will psychologically affect some Chinese people, especially when Chinese leaders may be starting to feel discouraged. The continued firm attitude of the United States and the stationing of the U.S. fleet in Hawaii may increase Chinese courage and provide spiritual assistance. They also said that the recent widespread rumors of large-scale Soviet military supplies transportation to the Far East are psychologically sufficient to maintain Chinese hope from collapsing. (United Press dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>Manila - Forty Americans residing in the Russian town of Dikiao yesterday telegraphed President Roosevelt, requesting the United States to adopt a strong policy on the Burma Road agreement. The telegram was the same as the one previously sent to Secretary of State Hull and the one sent to Shanghai's U.S. Fourth Naval Commander, Captain Baker, on July 16, saying, "We believe that succumbing to Japanese pressure is the surest way to seal our fate. We ask the United States to take a firm stand." (United Press dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>Churchill Says He Does Not Want to Force Peace on China</p>
<p>London - Prime Minister Churchill stated in the House of Commons yesterday that Britain wished to see China remain whole. Labour MP Noel-Baker then asked: "Can the Prime Minister's words be taken to mean that the British government will never force peace upon the Chinese people or compel them to accept peace terms tantamount to surrender to aggression?" Churchill replied: "That expresses my views." Noel-Baker further asked: "Does the Prime Minister mean that the British government still adheres to its Far Eastern policy based on the Nine-Power Treaty, etc.?" Churchill replied: "I have already made a statement that has been carefully considered. My previous views on this matter are well known, and I do not wish to add to them at this time." Former War Minister Hore-Belisha asked: "Does the Prime Minister believe that this concession to Japan will genuinely gain Japan's goodwill? Did the Prime Minister consult with the U.S. and Soviet governments throughout, and did he act with their consent?" Churchill replied: "I cannot give such assurance. I know nothing. I think that what we encounter in the Far East will be greatly influenced by what we encounter here. Of course, what we have done has not been done without fully considering the attitudes of the U.S. and the Soviet Union." Conservative MP Milner asked if the Prime Minister could give them an opportunity to have a full debate on the Far Eastern situation soon. The Prime Minister replied that a debate on foreign affairs could be held in the next week or two. Conservative MP Jewel asked the Under-Secretary of State whether, during negotiations with Japan, they would avoid the impression that Britain was willing to put pressure on the Chinese government or encourage a "Nanjing government." Butler replied in writing that the British government had no intention of pressuring the Chinese government and did not recognize the Nanjing regime.</p>
<p>At the same time, Foreign Secretary Halifax read the same statement on the Burma Road agreement in the House of Lords. Labour peer Addison called the agreement a most unfortunate measure, hoping that it would not have the detrimental effects he feared in China and elsewhere. Former Home Secretary Samuel said that if the hope for peace between China and Japan was not realized within a few months, then this measure might have to be extended indefinitely. Marley asked whether the government had consulted with the ambassadors to the U.S. and the Soviet Union regarding the impact of this decision on Anglo-Soviet and Anglo-American relations. The Foreign Secretary replied that the government had notified its ambassadors of the matter. He was not at liberty to state the extent of the exchange of views, but he believed that the government had not overlooked these considerations. The government had not been unmindful of the obligations it had accepted and the Nine-Power Treaty it had signed. The debate on this matter could be held secretly later. (Reuters dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>British Political Circles Attribute Concessions to Japan to the Soviet Union and the United States</p>
<p>London - Political figures here have recently commented on the British blockade of the Burma Road. It is said that the reason Britain reached an agreement with Japan was because it failed to obtain assistance from the United States and the Soviet Union. The British government has notified the U.S. government of the details of this negotiation. In essence, if Britain were to encounter serious difficulties with Japan due to adopting a strong policy, the United States might not be able to provide full assistance. As for the Soviet Union, the British government did not fully inform the country of the negotiation details. Although the meeting between the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Sir Cripps, and Stalin was extremely harmonious, the degree of rapprochement between Britain and the Soviet Union was not sufficient to support Britain. Under these circumstances, Britain naturally could not adopt a policy in the Far East that would only increase its burden. Moreover, at this time, Britain is dealing with the European war with all its resources and strength, and it really has no time to spare for other matters. Unless the two major neutral countries, the U.S. and the Soviet Union, can adopt a firm attitude in the Far East, Britain will not be able to do anything. (Havas dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>Soviet Union Denies Britain Ever Sought Its Opinion</p>
<p>Moscow - British Prime Minister Churchill stated in the House of Commons yesterday when reporting on the Anglo-Japanese agreement to block the Burma Road that "Regarding the agreement, the British side had discussed it with the Soviet Union." TASS has recently issued an officially authorized statement that what the British Prime Minister said is not true. In fact, the British government did not seek the Soviet Union's opinion or advice on this matter. In other words, the British side did not discuss the issue with the Soviet Union, and given the current state of Anglo-Soviet relations, the British government has no need to discuss this matter with the Soviet Union. In reality, British Under-Secretary of State Butler only notified the Soviet Ambassador Maisky, stating that the British government had decided to conclude an agreement with the Japanese side on the issue of blocking the Burma Road. (TASS dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>China's Determination to Resist Will Not Be Weakened by This</p>
<p>Chongqing - After the Yunnan-Vietnam and Yunnan-Burma transportation routes were successively interrupted, the relevant departments of the Chinese government are now preparing effective steps to continue to obtain supplies. At the same time, Northwest highway transportation is becoming more convenient than before. Therefore, the amount of supplies in this area will definitely increase. Upon examination, there is still a balance in the credit loan granted to China by the Soviet Union, and a large amount of goods can still be purchased. As for the British blockade of the Burma Road to make concessions to Japan, people from all walks of life here have generally said that China's determination to resist to the end will not only not be weakened by this, but will also be strengthened. A certain important person told a Havas reporter that Britain's betrayal of its promise to China will ultimately benefit China, as we have a full understanding of the need to be completely self-sufficient, and have worked hard to develop our own various resources. Before the development work yields results, the various main items currently stored are sufficient for use. Another important person also told a Havas reporter: "Anyone who believes that President Chiang may accept the attractive peace terms that Japan might offer on paper does not know President Chiang's character. He knows well that Japan will not be able to implement these conditions, and China's resources have not been exhausted and can still fight for several years. Therefore, he is determined to continue the war of resistance and is unwilling to risk China's fate as a gamble on Japan's unreliable promises. Japan is now eager to temporarily end the war so that it can seize opportunities elsewhere. Once it has gained something in the Pacific, its power will increase even further, and it will once again shift its focus to China. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, foreign opinion has often underestimated China's determination to resist and its ability to support itself, leading to numerous mistakes. If it is still believed at this time that China is willing to accept Japan's empty promises, it is another great mistake." (Havas dispatch, 19th)</p>

<p>Chongqing - The British government, disregarding Sino-British friendship and accepting Japan's illegal demands, signed the Anglo-Japanese agreement and suspended transportation on the Burma Road for three months. Upon hearing the news, people from all walks of life here were indignant and expressed their opinions. For example, Li Siguang and other members of the Sino-British Cultural Association sent telegrams to professors at British universities. Zhu Xuefan, Chairman of the China Labor Association, telegraphed the British Labour Party. The China-Burma Cultural Association telegraphed the Yangon and Burmese capital of the Burmese-Chinese Cultural Association, all requesting active action to urge the British government to quickly cancel the embargo decision.

<h3>Japan Says It Does Not Want Other Countries to Mediate the Sino-Japanese War</h3>
<p>Tokyo - Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman Suma Yakichiro recently told reporters that Japan is not considering third countries mediating the Sino-Japanese war.

<p>Hong Kong - Tokyo report, when the Ministry of Foreign Affairs received the press today, the spokesperson claimed that Japan does not intend to or welcome third countries coming forward to mediate or interfere in the Sino-Japanese incident. When a reporter asked how Japan reacted to Churchill's speech, the spokesperson said, Churchill's speech clarified Britain's intentions towards China and Japan, and this point was quite interesting. However, foreign countries have never suggested peace talks to Japan. What the Singapore Acting Governor Jones said in his broadcast speech was not true. If other countries make such a suggestion, the Japanese side must consider the content of the conditions listed therein and make a decision based on the current environment. When a reporter asked about Japan's peace negotiation conditions, the spokesperson said that it was inconvenient to discuss. When a reporter asked about how the Japanese side viewed Roosevelt's election as a presidential candidate, the spokesperson said that Japan did not feel interested in who the next presidential candidate of the United States was. Japan's attention is focused on the United States' foreign policy, especially its Far Eastern policy. He hoped that the United States' policy could adopt rational principles. When a reporter asked whether the opportunity for a Japanese-American compromise had already passed, the spokesperson said that Japan had completely and openly expressed its attitude and hoped to improve its relationship with the United States. In the past six months, Japan has been waiting for a straightforward reply from the United States, but it is still not too late to date. (Telegraph from 19th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - Japan hopes that the United States will be willing to be open and honest so that each can express their views and gain understanding.

He also said that Japan currently does not intend to ask a third country to intervene in the Sino-Japanese war. (Haitong Telegraph from 19th)</p>

<h3>Gansu Provincial Government Employees Provide Relief to Chongqing Refugees</h3>
<p>Chongqing - Gansu provincial government employees, because Japanese aircraft indiscriminately bombed the capital, specially collected 20,000 yuan in national currency to use for relief to Chongqing refugees. (Telegraph from 19th)</p>
<p>Chongqing - According to estimates by ordinary people here, each time Japanese aircraft recently attacked Chongqing, more than 100 tons of bombs were dropped. Residents collect fragments and sell them, which can be quite profitable. There was a thatched cottage that was destroyed by Japanese aircraft. The repair cost was only about 20 yuan, but the owner collected 100 jin of iron pieces and sold them for 170 yuan, leaving 150 yuan after the repairs. According to the general situation, repairs begin immediately after the bombing here, restoring the old appearance very quickly. If Japan wants to make Chongqing so devastated that it is uninhabitable, the intensity of the bombing must be increased at least four times compared to the past. In addition, the weather has cooled down in recent days, and the heat has dissipated, much to the residents' delight. In addition, the cloud cover has lowered, so even though it is the middle of the month, the moonlight is bright, and Japanese aircraft have not continued to fly to bomb. In short, President Chiang once said that the Chinese people are determined to resist to the end. By asking people from all walks of life here, one will know that this statement is not false.

<h3>Konoe's Cabinet Formation Work Can Be Completed Very Soon; Yesterday Discussed Basic Foreign and Defense Policies with the Newly Appointed Army, Navy, and Foreign Ministers</h3>
<p>Tokyo - According to semi-official Japanese news, four important members of the Konoe Cabinet met today and only dispersed after about five hours. Opinions have been completely compromised on basic foreign and defense policies. The attendees were the newly appointed Prime Minister Konoe, Army Minister Tojo, Navy Minister Yoshida, and Foreign Minister Matsuoka Yosuke. Konoe's efforts to form a cabinet are now expected to make rapid progress. (Reuters Telegraph, 19th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - Political observers recently predicted that Prime Minister Konoe may complete his cabinet selection tomorrow, because Konoe met with his selected three cabinet members this afternoon, namely Army Minister Tojo, Navy Minister Yoshida, and Foreign Minister Matsuoka, to discuss policies. It is heard that they discussed issues such as foreign and domestic policies after the establishment of a one-party system and the consolidation of the national political front. Well-informed sources believe that the Konoe Cabinet will prepare to determine its foreign policy based on the latest changes in the world situation. After this, Japan's foreign policy will especially focus on Germany, Italy, Britain, and the Soviet Union. In addition, it will implement a national mobilization order and consolidate national defense. As for the new cabinet's policy toward the "Nanjing Government," it will remain unchanged and will intensify military action against China in order to end the Chinese war as soon as possible. (United Press dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - "Nichi Nichi Shimbun" stated today that Foreign Minister and Colonial Minister Matsuoka's view is that Japan in East Asia and Germany and Italy in Europe should move forward so that each can achieve their goals. Japan should first eliminate the power of Britain and France in East Asia, and then stabilize a broad new structure encompassing China, Japan, "Manchukuo," and Southeast Asia. Finally, it should negotiate an alliance with Germany and Italy, but unconditional rapprochement with totalitarian states will not be effective at present. Furthermore, the tendency of the United States to interfere in East Asian and West Pacific affairs is the "greatest threat to the Far East" and should be completely eliminated. (Reuters dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>Chongqing - The semi-official newspaper, the English-language "Chu Pao," recently stated that Konoe's cabinet formation is a sign of Japan's political bankruptcy. The newspaper said that Konoe took office as Prime Minister on the eve of the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, but as a result, he was unable to prevent the war, nor was he able to end the war early. "Since Konoe previously failed to extricate the Japanese people from the Chinese quagmire, we believe that this time Konoe will also tend towards the same disappointment." The newspaper continued, "The Japanese military's favor for Konoe is due to dissatisfaction with multi-party politics, because Konoe advocates a one-party system, which is supported by the Japanese military." The newspaper also said that Japan wants to end the Sino-Japanese War, but there are only two ways to go: first, automatically admit mistakes and withdraw Japanese troops; second, use extreme force to destroy China's resistance. Japan will never take the first point, and Japan's provinces also lack the wisdom and courage to adopt this strategy. It is feared that Japan also feels that the second point is impossible, because Japan has already adopted extreme force to attack China, and China's army is fighting more bravely, while the Japanese army is suffering a sad defeat. Japan, due to political bankruptcy, is thinking of using the opportunity of the European war to engage in a southern advance in order to acquire Vietnam and the Dutch East Indies.

<h3>Soviet Union Strengthens Far East Defenses, Frequent Red Army Movements, Siberian Double-Track Railway Opens, Vladivostok Fleet Conducts Daily Drills</h3>
<p>Tokyo: A traveler riding the Siberian Railway from Moscow to Vladivostok last week witnessed the Soviet Union dispatching a large number of fresh troops to the Far East to strengthen its new defense line along the "Manchukuo" border. The reporter saw more than twenty Red Army trains, each with sixty cars, fully loaded with tanks, artillery, transport vehicles, and ambulances, heading towards the naval area. Additionally, there were long train carriages, believed to be carrying military equipment, running day and night continuously. Many of the passengers in the reporter's carriage were Red Army naval and army officers, also heading to the naval area and defensive bases in Mongolia. It is believed that the Soviet military vehicles are reinforcing defenses in the Far East, and this large-scale military movement is noteworthy. Last week, "Manchukuo" protested to the Soviet Union regarding the reported conflicts on the "Manchukuo"-Outer Mongolia border. At the same time, the reporter, while in Moscow two weeks ago, saw that Moscow was determined to "improve" Soviet defenses in the East, the Baltic Sea, and the Balkans, as the world situation was "favorable" for this military deployment. In Vladivostok, the reporter saw thirty Soviet warships concentrated in the port, including a squadron of new light cruisers and several 1,500-ton light destroyers. During the reporter's six-day stay, multiple submarines conducted daily exercises, and the high ground around the port was heavily fortified, with groups of soldiers working on defensive works daily. The Soviet Union is also accelerating the completion of its large-scale railway plan to ensure sufficient supplies and movements in the Far East. The 8,000-mile Siberian Railway from Moscow to Vladivostok has now been built with double tracks open to traffic. During the ten-day journey, the reporter witnessed freight trains traveling back and forth day and night.</p>
<p>Germany-Soviet Relations Appear Close but Are Distant</p>
<p>The deep impression gained by the reporter during his fifteen days in the Soviet Union is that the Soviet Union believes that once the Rome-Berlin Axis defeats Britain, it will inevitably turn towards the Soviet Union. Therefore, until the war between Germany and Italy against Britain is decisively won, the Soviet Union seems determined to mobilize all its military and civilian resources to create its unprecedentedly great military power. According to reliable journalistic sources, the rapid collapse of France was a major blow to the people and senior officials of the Soviet government. German sources in the Swedish capital and Soviet sources in Moscow acknowledge the apparent closeness but actual distance between Germany and the Soviet Union, and there are even claims that a conflict of interest may occur in the near future. The reporter, while in the Soviet Union, confirmed that Stalin's policy is to seize important military bases in the Baltic Sea, the Balkans, and other areas to strengthen its defensive position.</p>
<p>Black Sea Agreement Under Negotiation</p>
<p>According to British diplomatic sources in Moscow, the new ambassador, Sir Stafford Cripps, received an "exceptionally warm" welcome from senior Soviet officials, including Foreign Minister Molotov. However, regarding rumors of secret British-Soviet military treaty negotiations, Moscow sources could not ascertain any details. It is widely believed that Britain has notified the Soviet Union that it will support any changes made by the Soviet Union in the Balkans, and that Turkey is no longer bound by its treaty with the Allied nations, allowing the Soviet Union to freely form a new Black Sea agreement with Turkey and Bulgaria. According to what the reporter heard in Moscow, plans for this Black Sea agreement have been underway for a long time. This formation, obstructing Germany's attempt to attack the Mesopotamian oil fields, will indirectly aid Britain. While the reporter was in Moscow, commercial delegations from Hungary, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Turkey, Sweden, Finland, and Slovakia were conducting new trade negotiations with the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Soviet Union Sympathizes with China's Resistance Against Japan</p>
<p>The Soviet people all believe that China's resistance against Japanese aggression is the only "just war" in the world's war history. Soviet sources believe and told the reporter that the Soviet Union's policy in the European war is neither pro-German nor pro-Allied. They said that the Soviet Union is merely taking advantage of the current opportunity to strengthen its position in the world. They believe that Britain will not succumb to Germany, and that the European war will not end in the shortest possible time. They said that the European war will spread into a global conflict, and that the Soviet Union will not decide which side to join until the United States enters the war.

<p>UK and Soviet Rapprochement Possible</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden: Today's editorial in the "Social Democratic Newspaper" stated that due to the strength of the British working class, a renewed rapprochement between Britain and the Soviet Union is possible, and Japan's policy in the East is also a major factor contributing to this rapprochement. If Britain is no longer a powerful force in Asia, it will have far-reaching consequences, and the Soviet Union will also be significantly affected. Therefore, Churchill's recent hint that Britain will take the offensive after repelling the invasion suggests that Britain hopes to form a new grand alliance sooner or later to counter the triangular alliance of Berlin, Rome, and Tokyo. As for the rumors of a peace offer from the Axis powers, if true, it seems to prove that Berlin and Rome, while threatening to invade Britain, have some hesitation in their hearts.

<h3>Soviet Shipbuilding Accelerates</h3>
<p>Moscow: The Soviet newspaper "Red Fleet" reported yesterday that the speed of Soviet naval construction has now reached its peak. Since 1937, the Soviet Union's naval construction achievements have increased tenfold compared to before. Within these three years, the Soviet Union's shipbuilding will aim to reach the world's first position. Although the Soviet Union's submarine quantity and quality both exceed those of the world's largest naval powers, Soviet submarine construction can no longer maintain the same rate as some other countries. The Soviet Union will also greatly expand the construction of surface warships. (United Press dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<h3>Japan's War Expenditure in China Reaches 16 Million Yuan Daily, Financial Situation Plunges into Difficulties, Laborers' Lives Suffer, Affecting Social Security</h3>
<p>Moscow: "Pravda" today prominently published an article discussing the lives of Japanese workers, stating that the three-year war of aggression against China has greatly impacted Japan's economy and the lives of its laborers. Japan spends an average of 16 to 17 million yen daily on the war. As a result of the war of aggression against China, its domestic gold reserves have been depleted. Although the number of workers in war industries has increased, the number of unemployed people nationwide has also greatly increased. The future of the unemployed in Japan is extremely bleak, and they inevitably face chronic starvation. Prices in Japan have risen sharply, while wages have fallen, greatly affecting the living standards of workers. The employment of women and child laborers in Japanese factories is not limited to the silk industry; it is also common in other large-scale factories. Women's wages are far lower than men's, and the meager wages of child laborers are even more negligible. The means of exploitation in Japanese factories have been exploited to the highest degree. A large number of Japanese workers are deprived of holidays, and workers often work more than fourteen hours a day. As a result, the mortality and disease rates of workers have increased. During the Sino-Japanese War, Japan's mortality rate has increased, while the birth rate has fallen. In recent years, factory accidents have also increased, due to poor worker health, outdated machinery, and a fundamental lack of safety equipment. The authorities are indeed implementing high-pressure policies on workers, but strikes are still on the rise. If they want to curb the dissatisfaction of the workers in the future, it will inevitably become more difficult. Japan's current difficult situation is unprecedented. If this situation continues to worsen, even throwing the entire population into prison will not eliminate social chaos. (Dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<h3>Human Freedom Severely Threatened, Roosevelt Issues Declaration, Unwilling to Lightly Shirk Responsibility, Willing to Devote All Efforts to Serve the Country, Wallace Elected Vice Presidential Candidate</h3>
<p>Washington: President Roosevelt formally accepted the Democratic Party's nomination as its candidate for the upcoming presidential election last night, stating that he cannot refuse to be called upon to serve in public office. In his broadcast address to the Democratic National Convention last night, President Roosevelt declared, "If the American people accept the Democratic Party's nomination and determine that I should serve another four years as president, I will continue to devote all my efforts to public service." The President continued, "The power to nominate me as president rests with the people, and must be done through the free election methods of the United States. If the people, based on this free nomination method, elect me as president, I will certainly take on this position. However, this matter rests with the entire nation, not with the Democratic Party. My speech tonight is delivered with the utmost sincerity. I feel two different emotions at this moment, intertwined and conflicting. On the one hand, I personally desire to retire, and on the other hand, I am driven by my conscience. Recalling that I was elected as president for the second term in 1936, I greatly desired to hand over the responsibilities of the government to others after the end of my term. Since last September, I have clearly intended to announce that I have no intention of accepting re-election. However, I later felt that it would be unwise to make such a statement, and until the last moment, I considered whether or not I should express my personal political views for discussion within the party. I finally came to the reluctant conclusion that a declaration of these views should not be put before the Democratic Convention. Today, I am very grateful for your respect for me, but I know that you must understand the true meaning of what I say, which is that it is not merely an internal party nomination; I must be able to accept the real decision and do what I should do, not accept the party's nomination but accept the final will of the voters. Because tens of millions of citizens will be engaged in national defense, many people of sound judgment will unanimously agree that the personnel required today are like the personnel of 1917 and 1918. Every American is willing to participate in the defense of America. Neither justice nor efficiency can allow this great cause to be entrusted to any party or any group. I have spent many sleepless nights lying in bed asking myself whether I have the power as commander-in-chief of the army and navy to summon the men and women of the country to serve the country, or to train these men and women to serve the country. If the people of the country want me to do this, am I personally capable of doing it? In the current era, the fact that dominates the world is a kind of effective armed aggression, and aggression against various political organizations and societies that are the same as those chosen by the United States. This is not an ordinary war, but a violent revolution that threatens all mankind. This revolution is not a revolution to liberate mankind, but a revolution to enslave mankind. We face this kind of crisis, and no one can maintain or hope to maintain the personal choices enjoyed by free people in peacetime. All of this is what I think about every day. I am now telling you that, as I have been called upon to serve in public office, my conscience will not allow me to refuse. However, the power to entrust me with public office rests with the people, and this power should be exercised through the free election methods of the United States. Only the people themselves can elect the president. If I am elected, I dare to say directly and clearly that I will continue to do my best to serve the country." The President then spoke about domestic issues, saying, "We all know that the progress of our country and other countries in the Americas towards human freedom has been severely threatened by the events on other continents. Many countries in Europe have abandoned their inherent democratic politics due to the oppression of dictatorship or aggression, and have been forced to adopt what they call 'new and effective' political systems. Democratic America and some unconquered democratic countries are unwilling to surrender to this so-called 'safe and effective' political system. If, next January, an inexperienced 'novice' is replaced to preside over the government, we only hope that the one who presides over the government will not adopt an appeasement policy, and compromise with those who attempt to destroy all democratic countries. If I can continue to serve in public office, I will do my best to prevent the threat of war. The rights and wrongs of what I have done in the past to maintain peace in America and so on, I can only leave to the judgment of my people. We are already facing a major choice in history. This is not only a choice of government, but also a choice to maintain the survival of our culture, so that it will not be destroyed by the aggressors. In other words, what we are facing now is the choice between religion and atheism, the choice between justice and force, the choice between morality and vice, the choice between courageous action and misguided appeasement. The American people should decide what things are worth sacrificing, and these decisions cannot be empty words but must be put into action." (United Press dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<h3>Wallace Accepts Nomination and Delivers Speech</h3>
<p>Chicago: As a result of the American Democratic Party's nomination of a candidate for Vice President, Wallace (from Iowa) was elected, with a total of 1,095 votes, and Wallace alone received 665 votes. (Haitong dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<p>Chicago: US Secretary of Agriculture Wallace last night expressed his acceptance of the Democratic Party's nomination as a candidate for Vice President. The main purpose of his speech accepting the nomination was to continue to support the New Deal. Wallace promised to continue to work hard to achieve world peace, reduce unemployment, and restore farm prices. Wallace advocated active preparation in military, moral, and social aspects to maintain America's peace and democracy. Wallace said, "We must not allow totalitarianism to directly enter our country's borders, or to enter our country through our neighbors to the north and south. The courage and wisdom that has maintained our country's democratic politics for eighty years should allow it to continue for another four hundred and eighty years." Although the Chairman of the Convention, Farley, firmly opposed President Roosevelt's third term and supported the head of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, Jones, as Vice President, Wallace still greatly praised Farley. Wallace praised the achievements of the New Deal over the past seven years, but said that equality of agricultural income has not yet been achieved, unemployment has not been eliminated, and the world is not at peace. Wallace finally mentioned Roosevelt's nomination, saying, "President Roosevelt's talent in consolidating national defense and maintaining national security is unmatched. There is no one in the country who can compare to President Roosevelt. It is the duty of all of us to elect President Roosevelt as the next president. I now respectfully accept your nomination." (United Press dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<p>Chicago: Last night, when the name of Secretary of Agriculture Wallace was proposed to the Democratic Convention for nomination as a candidate for Vice President, a debate arose in the convention hall. Farley, the Chairman of the Democratic Convention who had hoped to be elected president but was defeated by Roosevelt, immediately expressed his opinion attacking Wallace. After Farley expressed his opinion, Oklahoma Representative Welch immediately stood up amidst the uproar and proposed the name of Federal Security Administrator McNutt, who had already withdrawn from the election. McNutt then, with a solemn expression, pushed through the crowd and stepped onto the podium. After repeatedly urging the crowd to stop the commotion, he declared that he would support Wallace.

<h3>Mass Rallies in the Three Baltic States Demand Annexation to the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Tallinn: Mass rallies were held in Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, demanding the adoption of the Soviet Constitution and joining the Soviet Union. The organization of revolutionary workers' committees is also actively underway. At the same time, the meeting of Zhdanov, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, Dekanozov, Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, and Vyshinsky, Deputy Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars, in Tallinn is particularly noteworthy. They served as Soviet representatives stationed in the capitals of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania after Soviet troops entered the Baltic states. (Haitong dispatch on the 19th)</p>

<h3>Important Stronghold in the English Channel, Island of Ushant Occupied by German Forces, German Side Claims Completion of Arc-Shaped Encirclement, Fierce Air Battles Occur Over British Isles</h3>
<p>Berlin: The island of Ushant, off the coast of Brittany in France, is a strategically important stronghold. It has now been occupied by Germany, becoming an excellent base for attacking the British Isles. With this location in German hands, the sea lanes of Britain will be greatly threatened. Germany has now achieved a balance of power in Norway and Brittany, and can launch a full-scale general offensive against the British Isles, as Brittany has fallen into Germany's arc-shaped encirclement. Furthermore, according to the German High Command yesterday, Orkdolf in Britain was heavily bombed by German planes, and many British merchant ships were destroyed. (International dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<p>London: The German Air Force launched a large-scale offensive against England, Scotland, and Wales yesterday, resulting in several deaths and countless injuries. However, the active situation in Britain has not diminished at all. German planes are bombing British cities all day long, and bombing Scotland at night. At the same time, the British side is implementing new defense laws, and tens of thousands of troops are guarding along the coast without the slightest slackening. It is rumored that Sunday is "the time when military operations begin." Wales suffered the heaviest casualties, where a German bomber was shot down. The Gibraltar Gazette reported that there were three deaths and countless injuries in several bombings there. British air force personnel are also busy, bombing German airfields in the Merville Henquetin area, and also bombing oil depots in Gelsenkirchen and Kent. British air force personnel in Boston said that reports of heavy losses in the air raids on Plymouth, Pembroke, and Cardiff last week have been dismissed by British intelligence as gross exaggerations. A spokesman for the intelligence service said that the areas that suffered the greatest damage were on the German-Dutch border. The British people no longer believe in German propaganda, and they whisper to each other, "Hitler has indefinitely postponed his invasion." (International News Service dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<p>British Air Force Retaliates Against Germany</p>
<p>London: When German planes attacked Britain yesterday, the British Air Force quickly dispatched aircraft to penetrate deep into German territory and the occupied territories to bomb. Yesterday, the areas attacked in Britain included Wales, northeast Scotland, southwest, southeast, and southern England. At least four German planes were shot down, including a Henschel Hs 126 reconnaissance aircraft. This was the first aircraft of this type to participate in the attack on Britain. When it appeared off the south coast, it was attacked by a Hurricane fighter. After a brief engagement, the plane flew low, smoking, and half out of control. When Wales was bombed, four schoolchildren were almost killed. Yesterday afternoon, a German plane flew to a town in southwestern England and dropped two bombs, both of which landed in the fields, causing minor damage to houses and some casualties. When a German plane flew over the northeast coast of Scotland, it dropped several bombs, also injuring several people and killing one person. According to the announcement by the Ministry of Internal Security, there was no major damage in the bombings of southwestern and southern England. A town on the southwest coast was attacked, with slight casualties. A German plane then flew to northeastern England and strafed a cottage. A German plane also attempted to attack a small vessel off the southeast coast of England without success, but one plane was shot down. Another German plane was severely damaged over a town and was probably unable to return to base. It was reported that a German plane attacking southeastern Scotland was shot down last night. A coastal aircraft was scouting over the English Channel and lost one plane. Other British planes dispatched to search encountered a German bomber and shot it down. According to an Air Ministry communiqué, British Air Force bombers continued to fly over Dutch and Belgian territory to bomb ships and airfields, as well as oil depots in the Ruhr area. Coastal aircraft attacked oil tanks in Ghent, and the bombs hit and started a fire. All British aircraft returned safely. The weather was bad last night, making bombing difficult, so several planes returned with their bombs without finding targets. (Reuters dispatch on the 19th)</p>

<h3>East African Italian Forces Continue to Advance Towards Buna, Occupying Salient Positions of British Forces; Abyssinian South Bombed</h3>
<p>Rome – Italian forces, after fiercely attacking Kenya and occupying Mojale, continue to advance towards Buna, having occupied salient positions of the British forces, shortening the battle lines by 300 kilometers. Military experts assert that the British forces face difficulties in defending Turkana Province and northern Kenya. Due to a lack of water sources at the front, British forces have been forced to retreat 100 to 150 kilometers. It is very difficult for British forces to construct defensive works. Italian forces will utilize their experiences from the Italian-Abyssinian War and use mechanized units to attack the British forces. Buna has a road leading to the Italian seaport of Kismayo. If Italian forces occupy Buna, they can shorten the supply lines. The Italian offensive is having a psychological impact on the local population. Among the 150,000 Indians in East Africa, there are signs of active anti-British sentiment. (Reuter's telegram, 19th)</p>
<p>Cairo – A communique issued here last night stated that on July 17, a small detachment of British light mechanized forces destroyed several enemy artillery pieces and a truck in the Kapso area of the western desert.

<h3>Triumphant Return of the Berlin First Division to Berlin, Goebbels Delivers Welcome Speech</h3>
<p>Berlin – The Berlin Brandenburg First Division, having triumphantly returned from Poland and France, entered the German capital last night through the Brandenburg Gate. At that time, war drums were pounding, military music was playing loudly, and the bells of all the city's churches were ringing. The troops were warmly welcomed by the Berlin district leader in the beautifully decorated Paris Square. German Propaganda Minister Dr. Goebbels, representing the Head of State, the government, and the German people, and General Froland, commander of the reserve forces, represented the German army in welcoming the triumphant troops. The Berlin soldiers, having been away from home for ten months, marched on Unter den Linden for more than two hours amidst the cheers of the Berlin citizens. This is the sixth time that German triumphant troops have passed through the Brandenburg Gate, but the welcome they received was the grandest of all. Although news of the troops' return home was only announced yesterday morning, almost all of the Berlin citizens gathered at the city gate to welcome their German fathers, sons, brothers, and friends. The roads through which the troops passed were transformed overnight into magnificent triumphal arches by the efforts of thousands of workers. The Place de Paris was the center of the celebration for this unprecedented ceremony and was transformed into a festive venue within hours. The surrounding thoroughfares of Brandenburg were decorated with German military flags and flags of Greater Germany. Huge platforms were built on both sides of the square, decorated with gold ribbons. Dr. Goebbels delivered a welcome speech to the German troops from one of the platforms. Before the troops arrived, citizens were already waiting respectfully by the roadside. When the first unit arrived, the crowd roared with cheers. The entire unit, led by the division commander, entered the capital through the central gate. All the vehicles were decorated with flowers. The division commander's car led the way, followed by the cars of the staff, and then the infantry. All the soldiers were full of energy. As they marched, the sound of their combat boots filled the air. General Froland first delivered a welcome speech on behalf of the German army, followed by Goebbels, who said that the homeland they saw would be the same as when they left. Finally, they gave a warm cheer to the Head of State and the Commander-in-Chief of the German Army. (Reuter's telegram, 19th)</p>

German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop personally welcomed him at the Anhalter Bahnhof station. Italian Ambassador to Germany Alfieri, staff members of the Italian Embassy, and important German party, government, and military figures were also at the platform to greet him. After Ciano got off the train, he was accompanied by Ribbentrop to the outside of the station, where he reviewed the honor guard, and then they went to the Bellevue Palace together to meet with State Secretary Meissner of the Chancellery.

<h3>The United States Opens an Air Force Base in Alaska</h3>
<p>Due to the increasingly serious Far East problem, the Naval Department is speeding up the construction of that airfield in Alaska as a precaution. Two seaplane bases, one in Sitka and the other in Kodiak, began construction last fall at a total cost of $12,739,000 and are scheduled to be completed within three years.</p>
<p>The third seaplane haven is Dutch Harbor on Unalaska Island. Currently, there is only a naval radio station and a small number of residents. No permanent naval construction is underway or planned.</p>
<p>The strategic value of these seaplane bases is extremely important. Aircraft taking off from these airfields can patrol most of the North Pacific, protect American coastal commerce, and prevent enemy attacks. The latest seaplanes can fly a distance of 1,200 to 1,500 miles, so these aircraft can scout almost to the far reaches when taking off from Kodiak and Pearl Harbor in the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<p>Seaplanes can take off from Seattle, arrive at Sitka, and then westward to Kodiak. Sitka is 553 miles from Kodiak. A direct line from Seattle to Kodiak is only 1,237 miles. However, because the entire route is in the ocean, and the climate in that area is extremely harsh, the Naval Department decided to divide the flight to Kodiak into two stages. It is hoped that an auxiliary aircraft station will be built at Dutch Harbor on Unalaska Island, but this project has not yet begun.</p>
<p>According to the Naval Department's original plan, Kodiak was originally a secondary base, but most of its equipment is of a first-class base. It is expected that within three years, it can accommodate two squadrons of reconnaissance aircraft, and three squadrons in emergencies. There will also be barracks, warehouses, and aircraft repair machines. The area's extremely cold and windy climate makes warehouses a necessity for the 24 permanently stationed aircraft.</p>
<p>Kodiak's climate is extremely harsh, but it is still better than elsewhere in Alaska. The climate around Dutch Harbor and the Aleutian Islands is even worse. Therefore, Kodiak is the best location for a naval air base in Alaska.</p>
<p>The development of the Kodiak airfield is now underway, including large-scale dredging work, so that a seaplane barge can be sent to Kodiak if necessary. After the dredging project is completed, the site can also be used as a submarine base.</p>
<p>After the Unalaska base is developed in the future, the activities of reconnaissance aircraft in the North Pacific can be extended by at least 500 miles, which will inevitably be more effective in dealing with hostile forces in the Far East.</p>
<p>The Naval Department once considered using Kodiak as a land-based aircraft base. Although land-based airfields can have many conveniences, the frequent heavy fog there would make land-based aircraft operations extremely dangerous, so this plan has been abandoned. Seaplanes can use blind flying and land on the sea surface 10 to 15 miles away, and then be towed into the warehouse.</p>
<p>The equipment at the Sitka airfield is intended for the use of aircraft flying along the coast to the Kodiak airfield area and its reconnaissance aircraft, and can also be used temporarily by several aircraft squadrons if necessary. Aircraft traveling to and from Kodiak may stay for several days if necessary due to the bad weather. Therefore, several barracks, warehouses, and storage facilities will be built to become a perfect base.</p>
<p>In addition to this, the United States and Canada have also begun discussing defense issues. The most important of these is the construction of an international highway to connect Canada and Alaska. President Roosevelt and the Canadian authorities discussed this issue at Warm Springs. The highway is 1,200 miles long and will cost $14 million to build.</p>
<p>Alaska, located in a remote area with a sparse population, is the most vulnerable point of the United States and Canada. Once Japan or Russia invades from Asia, Alaska will bear the brunt. After the international highway is built, it will be convenient for the United States to transport troops and supply the garrison. In a few years, it can also help develop Alaska's human and financial resources, making it independent in preventing foreign invasions.</p>
<p>The obstacle to building the highway is the funding issue. Canada is unwilling to accept this burden while fighting Germany. Most of the funding should be borne by the United States.</p>
<p>It is not known whether President Roosevelt will submit this issue to Congress this year, but he has requested that Congress extend the term of the International Highway Bureau, which is chaired by Democratic Congressman Magnuson and cooperates with similar Canadian agencies. The bureau's annual report stated that building a highway is a worthwhile project to pursue. It is a very important factor in developing the natural resources of Alaska and northern British Columbia, and it makes a great contribution to the welfare of the residents and the development of a vast new area.</p>
<p>This move can also increase the income of railway and shipping companies, develop Alaska's commercial aviation, and promote friendship between the people of the United States and Canada. Construction is also very easy to implement. The engineering problems have long been solved. However, the negotiations between the U.S. International Highway Bureau and the Canadian International Highway Bureau have not yet reached a concrete agreement on the issue of construction costs and routes.</p>
<h3>The Situation in Hong Kong is Tense and Uncertain</h3>
<p>Hong Kong Correspondence: While the French government accepted Japan's unreasonable demands, prohibiting Chinese and foreign goods from being transported through Vietnam, Japanese troops in Guangdong Province again invaded Shenzhen, Nantou, and even Shatoujiao and Shayuchong, approaching the Fenling area belonging to Hong Kong. Although the Japanese army had notified the Hong Kong military authorities that the Japanese army would not move closer to the Hong Kong border, in reality, the Hong Kong border has been threatened. Moreover, the only transportation line between Hong Kong and Guangdong Province is Shayuchong, which is almost severed.</p>
<p>Since the Japanese army has advanced to that area, it will cut off the transportation line, which is tantamount to completing the encirclement of Hong Kong from the outside. Therefore, in the past half-month, the goods that Hong Kong relied on Vietnam and Guangzhou Bay and Shayuchong in Guangdong Province to transport have all been suspended. At the same time, Japan has made the same demands on Britain as it did on France, prohibiting Chinese and foreign goods from entering and exiting Hong Kong and Burma. As a result, the Japanese army on the Hong Kong border is becoming more active, and the army and navy are appearing in Bao'an and Daya Bay to support the Japanese troops in Shenzhen and Shatoujiao. The Hong Kong authorities, in order to stabilize the border area and</p>
<p>to be prepared for any eventuality, are increasing troops and transporting equipment in the Fenling area on the one hand, and the Volunteer Defence Corps are also heading to assist in the defense. On the other hand, they are rushing to build artillery forts in the Western District and Eastern District, and are also confiscating civilian weapons. As a result, people's hearts are shaken, and the prices of daily necessities are rising, and financial prices are also falling. It is said that this serious situation occurred when the Japanese army first invaded Shenzhen in September of last year, and it is now being seen again. The most important task of the Hong Kong authorities at the moment is to evacuate the population. The methods are divided into two aspects: one is British women and children, who are</p>
<p>being forcibly evacuated. The first batch is the families of British soldiers, the second batch is the families of European Volunteer Defence Corps members, and the third batch is the families of general women and children of Fuyou籍 (a surname). The first batch began to withdraw to the Philippines on the first of this month, and the remaining batches are also withdrawing to an island in Africa or Australia. The other is Chinese women and children, but only the dependents of British-Chinese who have made contributions to Hong Kong or Chinese who have made contributions to Hong Kong are allowed. Other Chinese are advised to evacuate on their own. The poor people who have fled to Hong Kong from the mainland of Guangdong Province are also being sent back to their hometowns. American expatriates are now also withdrawing to the Philippines first. The Hong Kong army authorities have declared that this evacuation of the population is purely</p>
<p>a preventive measure and that the authorities are not concerned about the adverse effects of any deterioration in the situation. This is said to be due to the problem of rising food prices and the problem of public security. In short, the current situation in Hong Kong is indeed a scene of external relaxation and internal tension. Since the beginning of the Chinese war of resistance, a large number of important officials have moved their families to Hong Kong. Their dependents have also been leaving Hong Kong in droves in recent days, some to the United States or Honolulu, and others to the Philippines nearby. As for the wealthy Chinese merchants in Hong Kong, they are mostly calm because their property in Hong Kong cannot be moved, but they are only preparing to move elsewhere.</p>

<h3>Schools Sell Diplomas, Authorities Punish Severely; Detailed Measures for Student Status Certification Being Formulated</h3>
<p>Since the local education administrative organs withdrew with the army, the student status of students in public and private secondary schools in the city has not been reviewed on a periodic basis, which has led to an increasing trend of youths seeking advancement in life, and the school authorities have rarely paid attention to the examination of entrance qualifications, and there are even those who regard education as a business, selling graduation diplomas to increase school income, and disregarding the law and discipline, to the extreme. The education sector of the city is now thoroughly investigating the matter, and once it is verified, it should be severely punished. It is also feared that it will be difficult to reach the eyes and ears, and it is hoped that people from all walks of life can report this kind of business at any time so that it can be investigated and severely punished. As for the consolidation of school student status, detailed measures for student status certification during extraordinary times are being drafted and will be announced and implemented in the near future.</p>

<h3>Qifan vs. Paramount Tonight - A Scene from the United Cup Basketball Tournament - Class Two: Tianxing vs. Xihua</h3>
<p>Two basketball games in the United Cup Charity Basketball Tournament are scheduled for this afternoon. In Group A, Paramount will meet Qifan. The former has won all four games in the group and has not encountered an opponent, while the latter's lineup is depleted and loses every game. Therefore, the outcome of today's match is obvious. In another game in Group B, Xihua will face Tianxing. Xihua has former Guoguang players Qiu Xiaoci and Zhang Jinqiong, and its strength is very strong. Last time, it unfortunately lost to Xing by two points, which was due to bad luck. Tianxing defeated Shangxing by four points, so it is difficult to predict who will win today. The schedule and list of players are as follows:</p>
<p>Xihua - Tianxing (Class Two) 5:30 PM Zheng Zhifang</p>
<p>Qifan - Paramount (Class One) 6:30 PM</p>

<h3>Intense Artillery Battles in Zhenhai - Three Japanese Warships Sunk - A Small Number of Japanese Troops Landed and Were Annihilated - Chinese Artillery Units Transferred to the Front to Strengthen the Line - Postal and Telegraph Communication Between Shanghai and Ningbo is Open, But With Delays</h3>
<p>Since the Japanese navy implemented a blockade of the Zhejiang and Fujian coasts, Japanese warships have been probing Zhenhai, and Japanese aircraft have been harassing various parts of Ningbo, the situation has become tense for a time. A Japanese warship was sunk by Chinese troops outside of Zhenhai a few days ago, and the Chinese authorities immediately transferred troops to provide reinforcements to increase defense and resolve to give the Japanese a hard blow. Yesterday afternoon, a reporter from Da Zhong News Agency met with a prominent person from Ningbo in Shanghai and asked about the situation in Ningbo. According to him, he received a telegram from Ningbo saying that all was safe in Ningbo and that the rumors of Japanese troops landing in Zhenhai were completely inaccurate. However, today (i.e. yesterday), the Japanese warships anchored in Zhenhai bombarded the Chinese troops fiercely, and the Chinese troops also demonstrated their power and retaliated. The intensity of the artillery battles was unprecedented since the Japanese army first probed Zhenhai. It is said that as a result, two more Japanese warships were sunk and several were damaged. Seeing that the Chinese army's defense was well-organized, the Japanese army knew that it was difficult and retreated. Although Ningbo was strafed by Japanese aircraft today, the Chinese side suffered no losses and the residents are safe. Daxie Island near Chuanshan, Zhenhai, was also forcibly landed by Japanese troops a few days ago, but was also bravely repelled by the defending troops. However, it is reported that a Shanghai merchant received a telegram from Quanzhou yesterday afternoon, saying that "Quanzhou was bombed by Japanese aircraft at 10:00 AM yesterday, and the docks and warehouses were slightly damaged."</p>
<p>Coastal War Report</p>
<p>A reporter from Da Guang News Agency learned from Ningbo groups in Shanghai last night that on the morning of the 18th, Japanese warships gathered near Longshan Guanhaiwei and fired 26 shells at the coast, destroying several civilian houses. A shell also landed on a primary school in Hengshan, Yindong, but it did not explode. Three shells also landed in Xianxiang, damaging only a dozen houses. There were no other losses. The Japanese warships anchored at Huangniu Reef in Xiangshan Port also shelled the shore the other day. By yesterday morning, five Japanese warships anchored in the Likang waters outside Zhenhai had sailed northwest towards Hangzhou. More than 100 Japanese naval landing troops who landed in Xiaoyi Jiangnan outside Zhenhai had been annihilated by the Chinese army. The Japanese troops who landed at Guoshan Tou, Jinji Mountain, Chang Tiao Zui, and Dingyuan Fortress outside Zhenhai were also driven out by the army. However, there are still small groups of Japanese troops in Qingzhi, Zhenhai, who are currently being encircled and annihilated. In addition, the two small islands of Huang Mang Island and Qiliyi Island outside Zhenhai are isolated overseas. They are small in size and have no military value except for a lighthouse on Qiliyi Island, so there is absolutely no need to pay attention to them. Huang Shaoxian, the chairman of Zhejiang Province, believing that the situation in eastern Zhejiang is tense, has resigned from his position in the central government in Guilin and rushed back to eastern Zhejiang to take command, and is jointly planning defense with Liu Jianxu, the commander-in-chief of the □ Group Army. In recent days, the Central National Army of the Chinese side and the □□ Department have rushed to the front line in eastern Zhejiang, including a unit of artillery, so the coastal defense has become more consolidated. The people of Yongzhen are calm. The Zhenhai County Government and the County Party Department have moved back to the city to work.</p>
<p>Postal and Telegraph Communications</p>
<p>Shanghai-Ningbo telegrams, which were interrupted the other day, were quickly restored. A reporter from Da Zhong News Agency learned yesterday from the American Global Wireless Electric Company (i.e., the American News Agency) that telegrams between Shanghai and Ningbo are still accessible. Due to the tense situation in Ningbo, merchants and personal friends and relatives between Shanghai and Ningbo are inquiring about news and safety, so communication is frequent and company business is more prosperous than usual. However, because the Ningbo authorities are evacuating people, it is uncertain whether the recipients in Ningbo will receive telegrams sent from Shanghai. If companies and individuals move to other places, then telegrams will naturally be difficult to receive. Light mail to cities and counties in eastern Zhejiang such as Jinhua, Ningbo, Shaoxing, Zhuji, Yuyao, Shangyu, Lanxi, Shengxian, Xinchang, Dongyang, Yiwu, Fenghua, Wenzhou, etc., cannot be transported due to the interruption of shipping, so mail to the above-mentioned areas since the 16th is still stored in the Bureau's warehouse. It is now reported that the first batch was shipped yesterday morning and rerouted through Fuzhou. In the future, all mail to eastern Zhejiang will be shipped by sea, and it will never be interrupted. However, the delivery time will be slightly longer. Mail to the southwest provinces and cities is still forwarded by the post office through the sea, and rumors of interruption or rerouting are inaccurate.</p>
<p>Japanese Warship Movements</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, many white leaflets issued in the name of "Japanese Fleet Headquarters Reporting Team" and other names were found in the Nanjing Road area. They stated the "reasons" for invading eastern Zhejiang, which was to cut off military supply routes. All of them were torn up by those who picked them up. However, according to people from Dinghai, in recent days, the Japanese troops stationed in Dinghai "Zhoushan Island Base Team" Laijima Shigeo unit have been repeatedly reinforced. It is said that they came from Shanghai. Four Japanese warships and one transport ship (transformed from a transport ship) are now anchored in front of the port, and small motorboats are sent out from time to time to patrol nearby. It is also reported that the commander of the Japanese Navy in Shanghai, Tomiguchi Shuichiro, arrived in Dinghai by ship the other day, attempting to plan an invasion of eastern Zhejiang.</p>
<p>Blocking Navigation at Likang</p>
<p>Gordonlun of the German firm Ruilin Foreign Trade Company was originally scheduled to sail to Likang, Zhejiang Seaport, last night, but suddenly changed. The company was unable to determine the exact sailing date. The British ship Maria Mahler was originally scheduled to sail to Songmen this morning, and the customs clearance procedures had been completed. It has now been ordered to sail to Haimen instead. Two oil tankers of the British firm Asiatic Petroleum Company reportedly sailed to Shanghai yesterday morning.</p>
<h3>Suburbs Gradually Opening Up - Flour Transported to Shanghai - Reportedly, the Japanese Side Agreed to an Agreement Yesterday - To Transport 18,000 Bags Per Day</h3>
<p>According to reliable sources, after several weeks of negotiations, the barriers around Shanghai have recently been partially opened to allow flour to be transported into the Public Concession and save it from the flour shortage it has been suffering. Although the amount of flour transported in from the surrounding areas is not large, the crisis of the flour shortage has been lifted. It is said that the price of domestic flour is expected to fall below 15.5 yuan per bag (49 pounds) soon. According to an agreement reached between the Japanese side and the relevant parties in this city, starting next week, 18,000 bags of 110-pound Chinese flour will be allowed to be transported into the Public Concession daily. At the same time, a large quantity of wheat ordered from Australia and the United States will also arrive in Shanghai in August. Yesterday, the flour market in this city showed a clear response, and the price of flour fell to 22.5 yuan per bag, and at the lowest point, it fell to 21.5 yuan.</p>
<h3>New Hurricane - Continuing Towards Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Pacific hurricane during the high tide period deserves attention. According to a report from the Xujiahui Observatory at 6:00 AM yesterday, it has advanced to 21 degrees north latitude and 124 degrees east longitude, heading northwest-west. The wind force center is within 120 nautical miles, and the wind heat is unknown. In addition, there is a high tide in this city, with heights of about 11 feet, which is worrying that it will coincide with the hurricane and requires attention.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Situation Eases - Number of Passengers Decreases</h3>
<p>Since the situation in Hong Kong became tense, foreign expatriate women and children took ships to evacuate, and many Chinese also moved away. However, the situation in Shanghai has eased, and the border with Shenzhen has calmed down, so the number of evacuees has decreased, and it is no longer as crowded as before. The tickets for various ships sailing from Hong Kong to Shanghai had originally been sold out until the 20th of the month, but many people have cancelled their tickets. In recent days, the number of passengers on ships such as the Jardine Shandong Taisheng, the Taikoo Niuzhuang Taiyuan, and the Jebsen Meizhou, all sailing to Shanghai, has decreased compared to before. The President Taft of the American President Mail Line is scheduled to depart from Hong Kong at 2:00 PM today and arrive in Shanghai. This ship will carry a group of evacuating American expatriate women and children, about 50 people, who will temporarily reside in Shanghai. However, the passengers' luggage is not as crowded as that of the President Coolidge.</p>
<h3>Dredger Jianshe to Inspect Hull - Machinery and Cabins Inspected - Work Can Begin Soon</h3>
<p>The Jianghai Customs and the Shanghai Bureau manage the dredging of the Huangpu River. Work was halted after August 13th. After the Chinese army withdrew to the west, all the dredgers, large and small, were detained by the Japanese navy, which led to gradual siltation on both sides of the Huangpu River for the past three years. After the Customs made great efforts to negotiate with the Japanese side, the Japanese side allowed the Shanghai Bureau to reorganize and assign Japanese personnel to take charge. Since last month, two small dredgers have started work. The large dredger Jianshe, which was purchased in the United States to dredge the Xinzhentan outside the Wusong Estuary, has been docked at the Taikoo Company's floating pontoon at the Xinkai River, French Concession. Two months ago, it also began to inspect the machinery and the bottom and top of the cabins and paint the hull. It is now reported that this work has been completed. However, the hull has not been inspected for three years, so it was unmoored from the Taikoo pontoon on the morning of the other day and sailed to the south Huangpu. It is said that it will enter the Jiangnan Shipyard to inspect the hull. After the inspection is completed, it is expected that it will be able to start dredging work.</p>
<h3>Geneva Red Cross to Investigate - Those Missing in the European War - Relatives and Friends of Missing Prisoners and Civilians Can Entrust the Investigation</h3>
<p>The Swiss Consulate General in Shanghai recently received a letter from the International Committee of the Red Cross in Geneva, stating that since the outbreak of the European War, the Committee has received many inquiries from the outside world about prisoners of war and missing residents due to the war. In the future, anyone who has relatives or friends missing due to the war can inquire with the Committee in Geneva, Switzerland, and it will do its best to investigate and reply.</p>
<h3>Coal Ball Costs Reduced - Retail Prices Should Fall Quickly</h3>
<p>According to coal industry sources, the sharp drop in coal prices has seriously threatened coal merchants holding large quantities of spot goods, resulting in significant losses. The prices of various goods in the market are superficially tight but secretly loose, and the sources are also pouring in one after another, so inventories are increasing day by day. Therefore, the cost of coal ball production has been significantly reduced. Over the past few days, the wholesale prices of the same industry have been falling. Retail prices need to be lowered urgently, so it is hoped that the industry association will immediately convene representatives from each factory to discuss price reduction measures to reduce the burden on the common people.</p>
<h3>Brief News Summary</h3>
<p>Cen Asan, stall vendor No. 29 at the Seymour Road vegetable market, was found to have added water to ducks again, a repeated offense. The court sentenced him to a fine of 15 yuan on the 12th of this month as a warning. In addition, a certain amusement park was found to be selling colored drinks that were not sanitary.

<p>Postal Bureau parcel notice: Yubei branch bureaus that were previously taken over by the Beiping District are now under the jurisdiction of the Kaifeng Henan Bureau. Furthermore, after investigation, the Beiping postal district now only has jurisdiction over the Nankou Bureau, the Baotou and its eastern line above the Pingyuan Road. For various bureaus to which these lines transfer, only scattered parcels from individuals can be accepted. However, when accepting parcels, the sender should be consulted to take responsibility.</p>
<p>Kunshan is a rice-producing area, but rice prices are high. Therefore, a public rice sales office was established, limiting the price to 4.5 jiao per liter. Unexpectedly, it was soon suspended, and rice stocks ran out, causing panic. Now flour is used instead, with 1.5 jin of flour equivalent to 1 liter of rice, and each jin is sold for 3 jiao. However, since residents are not accustomed to wheat-based foods, the price of flour sold has not been lowered, which has caused great dissatisfaction.</p>

<h3>The Board Member of the Da Mei Yi Bao and Da Mei Bao, Zhang Sixu, was Murdered Yesterday; He Died from Five Gunshots Before He Could Be Treated; His Body Was Sent to the International Funeral Home Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 4:30 PM, a terrifying bloody incident occurred at Chesilhurst Coffee Shop, No. 72 Jing'an Temple Road. The victim was Mr. Zhang Sixu, a highly respected figure in both Chinese and foreign communities. He was also a director of Da Mei Printing Company, which publishes the Chinese and English Da Mei Evening News and Da Mei Bao, as well as a business manager at American International Assurance Company. He was shot five times and died a heroic death. The news sent shockwaves throughout Shanghai. Details are recorded below:</p>
<p>A Premonition Fulfilled Upon Arrival at the Coffee Shop Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>Given the recent special circumstances in Shanghai, Mr. Zhang's relatives and colleagues at the Da Mei Printing Company had repeatedly advised him to leave Shanghai. However, Mr. Zhang was deeply concerned about the safety of his colleagues and did not want to "live in seclusion." He had previously hired a bodyguard from the Shanghai Municipal Police, but dismissed him last week. Yesterday afternoon around 3:00 PM, Mr. Zhang left Da Mei after finishing his work and drove out. A Western colleague asked for a ride, to which Mr. Zhang jokingly replied, "If you are not afraid of death, you may come along." Little did he know that his jest would become a grim prophecy. Around 4:00 PM, he sent his driver to his residence to retrieve his sportswear and tennis racket.</p>
<p>Unexpected Tragedy at the Coffee Shop</p>
<p>At 4:30 PM, while Mr. Zhang was sitting alone and resting on the second floor of Chesilhurst Coffee Shop, two thugs suddenly rushed upstairs. Without a word, they attacked Mr. Zhang, who was unarmed, and opened fire. The sound of gunfire rang out. Mr. Zhang had no time to dodge and was immediately wounded and fell to the ground, bleeding profusely. He silently succumbed to his injuries. Having achieved their aim, the thugs rushed out of the shop. A Polish gentleman named Krassnoff happened to be entering the coffee shop at that moment and bravely stepped forward to intercept one of the thugs. In desperation, the thug shot Krassnoff in the abdomen and fled. Krassnoff was rushed to Hong En Hospital for treatment but died at 6:45 PM.</p>
<p>Injuries to Vital Organs Prevented Rescue</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang's body was first sent to Hong En Hospital at 5:30 PM yesterday afternoon, and then transferred to the Red Cross Hospital on Haig Road. Reporters rushed to the scene, and a hospital attendant led them to the morgue opposite the hospital. After opening the door, the attendant slid open the wooden compartment where the body was placed. Mr. Zhang's body lay on the lowest shelf in the middle of the wooden cabinet. He was dressed in a light gray checkered silk long gown, soaked in bright red blood. His chest was exposed, and there were gunshot wounds on his right neck, right kidney, and arm. Mr. Zhang's body was transferred to the International Funeral Home yesterday. The Da Mei Printing Company will organize a funeral committee, and the date of the encoffining ceremony will be decided today.</p>
<p>Dedicated to the Newspaper Industry</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang was a director of Da Mei Printing Company, which publishes the Chinese and English Da Mei Evening News and Da Mei Bao, and also a business manager at American International Assurance Company. He was a native of Shantou, 44 years old, and a graduate of Shanghai Anglo-Chinese College. He studied at Harvard University and Ford University in the United States, earning a bachelor's degree, and later studied journalism at Columbia University. He returned to China in 1924 and joined the Tianjin North China Star as a reporter and later as an editor. He also taught at Soochow University. In 1927, when Ding Wenjiang was the Military Governor of Songhu, he was appointed as a First-Class Secretary in the Governor's Office. He later returned to his old profession, serving as the editor-in-chief of the Shanghai National News Agency. In 1930, he joined the Continental Daily News as an editor. In 1932, he was appointed Director of the Intelligence Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs by the then Foreign Minister Chen Youren, a position he also held under Foreign Minister Luo Wen'gan. After the end of the January 28th Incident, when China and Japan held negotiations, he assisted Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Guo Taiqi in attending the Sino-Japanese Armistice Conference.

His wife is a Chinese expatriate from Salt Lake City, USA, and many of her relatives live there. Her mother's family are close friends with American Congressman King. He is survived by a twelve-year-old daughter who speaks three languages.</p>

<h3>Report on Legal Tender Reserves Published; Reserves are Sufficient; Rumors of Inflation Disproven by Facts</h3>
<p>After the implementation of China's new monetary policy, the custody of legal tender reserves and the matters of issuance and redemption are handled by the Issuance Reserve Management Committee to ensure accuracy and credibility. The committee conducts monthly inspections according to the regulations. The Shanghai Banking and Money Trade Association has recently issued a decree from the Ministry of Finance, announcing the legal tender reserve inspection report of the four banks (Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Communications Bank, and Farmers Bank of China) as of June 30, 1940.

The cash reserves are higher than those of most countries. The inspection results are in full compliance. Rumors of inflation in China have been proven to be completely inaccurate. Cash reserves remain sufficient, and all rumors have been dispelled.</p>
<h3>Yang Jinrui Kidnapped; Escapes Dangerously</h3>
<p>The day before yesterday (the 18th) at around 3:00 PM, five Sikh constables (numbered 111, 212, 187, 430, and 594) from the Public Concession Police were on duty near the Aurora University on Fanhwangdu Road when a middle-aged man passed by in a rickshaw. As the rickshaw approached the constables, the man jumped out and shouted for help. The constables immediately stepped forward to inquire, but due to language barriers, they took the man to the police station. After questioning by the inspector, it was learned that the man was Yang Jinrui, the owner of Jin Tai Fashion Company at 301 Tongfu Road, who had been kidnapped on the 16th. According to Yang, he was kidnapped to a shed without a number on Route Brien in Western Shanghai and guarded by two armed bandits. He escaped from the bandit's den the day before yesterday while the two bandits were fast asleep.</p>
<h3>Wang Anlu, a Worker at This Newspaper, Was Encoffined Yesterday</h3>

The coffin is prepared to be transported back to Suzhou for burial. His father is sixty-three years old, with white hair. His wife is thirty-four years old and left behind a daughter of only three years old. The family cried mournfully, and the scene was extremely tragic.</p>
<h3>Even Though the Cholera Season Has Not Yet Arrived, Citizens Should Still Take Precautions</h3>
<p>According to the Shanghai Municipal Council Health Department's June report, two cases of true cholera were recorded last month. Since the cholera season is still early, it is difficult to determine how severe the situation will become in the future. Typhus fever has decreased due to the hot weather and is expected to decrease significantly next month. At the same time, the incidence of relapsing fever will also decrease. The incidence of typhoid fever is increasing. The Health Department has taken appropriate measures to ensure that the food sold in the market meets the standards of the Health Department. A total of 2,930 deaths of Chinese people were recorded, including 1,520 exposed corpses. The main causes of death were typhoid fever, tuberculosis, and pneumonia. A total of 1,577 bodies were cremated, and 652 coffins were buried.</p>

<h3>The French Tramway Labor Strike; The Stalemate Remains; Iron Gates Continue to be Closed; Many Deaths by Drowning on Ferries; Labor and Management Resume Negotiations Without Concrete Results</h3>
<p>Since more than 700 coppersmiths from the machine department of the French Tramway Company went on strike on the 17th and gathered in the Nanshi area to hold a meeting, the French Concession authorities reportedly received information that this strike had a "political" purpose. To maintain security within the concession, in addition to dispatching armored vehicles and a large number of detectives to closely guard around the tramway company, they also closed all iron gates in the French Concession leading to the Nanshi area the day before yesterday. These security measures had not been lifted as of yesterday and, due to the delay in the strike, have shown an increasingly serious trend. Yesterday, all the power distribution huts of the electric light company scattered across the roads in the French Concession were guarded by an Annamese constable with a gun. Other public utilities, such as the waterworks and power plants, have also had additional guards posted by the French police, with strict security measures that have not been relaxed at all.</p>
<p>Iron Gates Remain Closed All Day</p>
<p>Since the French Concession authorities suddenly closed all the iron gates at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Rue du Consulat the day before yesterday due to the strike by the coppersmiths of the tramway company, the situation suddenly became tense. It has greatly inconvenienced the residents and vendors traveling between Nanshi and the concession. Yesterday afternoon, this newspaper's reporter inspected the area from the Nanyang Bridge iron gate along the way and saw that each iron gate remained closed as before. At the New North Gate, Old North Gate, and other places with relatively heavy traffic in the past, there were three to five Vietnamese policemen stationed, guarding with guns. Looking from afar at places such as Mingguo Road and Liuxiangyuan Road, except for the occasional Japanese military vehicle speeding past, there were hardly any pedestrians, creating a desolate scene that filled people with a sense of the past and present.</p>
<p>Tragic Ferry Overturn Incident</p>
<p>Due to the closure of the iron gates, residents who want to travel between the south and middle of the concession must take ferries and detour around Pudong. At 8:00 AM yesterday morning, due to interference by the Japanese puppet police at the South Wharf, the crowd rushed to get off the boat, and the weight of the boat lost its balance, causing three ferries to suffer an accident. Although many people were rescued, at least twenty to thirty people drowned.</p>
<p>Rumors that Striking Workers Will Resume Work</p>
<p>After the entire coppersmiths room workers went on strike on the 17th, the company representatives held negotiations with labor representatives at 3:00 PM the day before yesterday (the 18th) in order to prevent the situation from escalating. The company authorities stated that they were willing to consider the labor demands but made it a condition to resume work first. The labor side insisted that they were unwilling to resume work unless all their demands were completely agreed to. As a result, the negotiations broke down. Yesterday morning, the two sides resumed negotiations, but there was no concrete result. However, it was rumored yesterday that the striking workers would resume work today or tomorrow, and it was said that the management had agreed to give the workers a raise of one yuan per day and thirty yuan per month. However, inquiries to the management did not confirm this statement.</p>
<p>Excessive Demands Displease the Company</p>
<p>Mr. Pfeifferly, the manager of the French Tramway Company, said that the number of striking workers was between 600 and 700. These workers had already received a raise a month ago, and after a short interval, they made demands again, and this time the demands were very excessive. In fact, the company's treatment of workers is no different from any other large company in Shanghai. It is rumored that the striking workers have requested the Chinese directors of the French Concession to serve as mediators. However, inquiries to the French Concession Taxpayers' Association and individual directors have revealed that they have not received a formal request.</p>
<p>Temporarily Hiring Russians to Repair Vehicles</p>
<p>The French Tramway Company is usually extremely busy due to its three businesses, the tramways, buses and trolleybuses. Especially the coppersmiths room etc. of the machine department, as all vehicles usually have damage after one day of running, must be repaired before they can be driven the next day. Therefore, their work is extremely important. But since the workers of the coppersmiths room went on strike, this work could not continue, resulting in a large number of vehicles waiting to be repaired in the factory for several days. Moreover, the impact may gradually reduce the number of vehicles in operation due to damage. In order to maintain the normality of public transportation, the company authorities specially recruited dozens of temporary Russian workers starting the day before yesterday to intensify their work and repair the vehicles that are damaged every day. Therefore, there is no need to worry about public transportation within the French Concession.</p>
<p>Workers Gathered in Nanshi Yesterday</p>
<p>Then the reporter walked to the Bund, took a private boat to the South Wharf to disembark, and entered the Nanshi area. Except that small businesses were relatively quiet due to the inconvenience of transportation, the residents were still able to maintain calmness and were not frightened by the closure of the iron gates. According to sources, the reason for the French Concession's closure of the iron gates this time was that most of the striking workers lived in the Nanshi area. In order to prevent the striking workers from being exploited and expanding the strike, the French Concession authorities closed all the iron gates to show resistance. It is heard that the striking workers still gathered at the Public Stadium yesterday morning and afternoon to discuss the proposed wage increase and requested the French authorities to approve it as soon as possible to avoid the situation from becoming increasingly serious and causing adverse consequences. However, when the reporter rushed to the Public Stadium, most of the workers had already dispersed. Later, after further inquiries by the reporter, the workers' request for a general 30% wage increase to be given by the company, after negotiation between the workers' representatives and the authorities, the company promised to consider it immediately and find a compromise solution. If the authorities can sincerely cooperate, the labor strike can be resolved smoothly today, and the iron gates in various places can be opened as usual.</p>
<h3>Manchurian Goods Smuggled into North China; Valued at 150 Million Japanese Yen Last Year; Opium Smuggling from Rehe is the Most Prevalent</h3>
<p>The English Da Mei Evening News reported that, according to the Tokyo semi-official "Japan Times &amp; Mail," although the Japanese side has recently tightened control at the passes along the Great Wall, Manchuria still has goods being smuggled into North China on a large scale. It is estimated that the value of smuggled goods last year was 150 million Japanese yen, most of which was opium. Opium smuggling from Rehe into North China is the most prevalent, resulting in a 50% loss in Rehe's normal opium tax revenue. The price levels in Manchuria and North China differ greatly, which is an important reason for the continued smuggling. The price of many goods south of the Great Wall is three times higher than that north of the Great Wall.</p>
<h3>Reinvestigation of the Japanese Military Police Detention Incident; Agreed Upon by the Result of Baker and Miura Consultations</h3>
<p>The Times reported that U.S. Navy 4th Marine Regiment Commander Colonel Baker has begun a detailed investigation into the case of the U.S. defense forces detaining sixteen Japanese military police. Japanese authorities believe that if necessary, the Japanese side can allow the sixteen military police who were arrested at the time to testify. According to authorities, this decision was the result of several days of consultations between Colonel Baker and Japanese Military Police Commander Major Miura.</p>
<p>Japanese Consul Sends Letter to US Consul General</p>
<p>Regarding the case of two Japanese nationals being beaten by soldiers of the U.S. Navy 4th Marine Regiment in the Oriental Cafe last Sunday, Japanese Consul-General Yoshiaki Miura has sent a letter to the U.S. Consul-General. Based on the results of the Japanese consular police investigation, the letter recounts the details of the incident and requests the U.S. Consul-General to discipline the two soldiers who "committed the crime" and to "rectify discipline" to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future. At the same time, on behalf of the two injured Japanese, he reserves the right to demand compensation for losses.</p>
<h3>British Gas Company Workers Go on Strike; Demand Improved Treatment from the Company; The Stalemate Continues as Management Refuses to Accept</h3>
<p>The British Gas Company at 565 Yuqiaqing Road had a strike by all employees on April 17 of this year due to demands for improved treatment from the management, which was resolved satisfactorily through mutual understanding between both sides. However, yesterday at 9:00 AM, the company's workers suddenly went on strike again. The reporter of the Pingming News Agency interviewed and learned the details as follows:</p>
<p>Cause of the Strike</p>
<p>According to the workers of the company, since the company accepted the workers' demands in April of this year, the workers believe that the company authorities have not fulfilled the obligations of the conditions. Recently, the company dismissed Yang Hanzhang, a worker in the coppersmiths department, on the pretext that the company authorities ordered the workers in the coppersmiths room to do other work, which was rejected by the workers. Some workers, given the soaring rice prices, submitted a written request to the engineer, Mr. Samson, on the 17th of this month, requesting a further increase in wages, which was rejected. Therefore, all the workers went on strike at 9:00 AM yesterday, and the strike is in a stalemate.</p>
<p>Workers' Demands</p>
<p>It is learned that the labor side has submitted 16 conditions to the company for improved treatment. The contents are as follows: (1) A temporary allowance of 50%, including monthly overtime hours, shall not be less than 15 yuan (excluding commodity allowances); (2) If the rice price is above 20 yuan, the workers will pay the company 20 yuan per month, and the company will issue one picul of No. 2 Saigon rice; (3)</p>
<p>Annual increase</p>
<p>The wages will be increased by 10%, restoring the 5% wage increase made in 1936, and another 10% wage increase will be added. In the future, the factory should give a special wage increase to each worker who has worked for 15 years or more; (4) Bank holidays, wages will be paid as usual. If they work as usual, they will be paid double wages. Saturday's wages will be paid as usual, and four corners will be given for transportation if the worker lives far away, or the factory will send a car to pick them up; (5) Workers shall not be dismissed without reason. If the factory</p>
<p>Intends to dismiss</p>
<p>Should notify one month in advance and pay a severance fee of six months, and the savings will be calculated in accordance with the regulations; (6) The annual bonus should be one month's salary, and new and old workers are treated the same. Those who have not worked for a full year will be calculated on a monthly basis; (7) Apprentices who have worked for more than three years must be paid according to the wages of technicians; (8) Workers who work outside the factory shall be given two sets of uniforms and one set of rain gear; (9) Temporary workers who work in the factory as technicians for more than three months may be promoted to permanent workers, and the allowance must be calculated according to permanent workers; (10) The working hours of the three shifts were originally</p>
<p>Eight hours</p>
<p>Calculated, with two days off per month, or a raise of two days' wages; (11) Each worker should have two weeks of vacation per year, with wages paid as usual. If a worker works for one year without taking leave, the factory should pay an additional week's wages, "except for sick leave"; (12) If a worker is injured on duty, wages will be paid as usual during the medical treatment period, including all allowances. If the injury is severe and results in disability, the factory will pay a pension for ten years, calculated according to the last month's wages, or pay wages on a monthly basis until the worker's children</p>
<p>When they are sixteen years old</p>
<p>Can enter the factory to work. If they die due to military service, the factory will pay for funeral expenses and a pension, which shall not be less than 1,000 yuan; (13) The savings should be calculated at 10% of the annual salary. If they have worked for more than 15 years, they will be taken out in one lump sum; (14) For the sake of labor-management cooperation, the factory should recognize the club that the employees promote for appropriate entertainment, and the factory should provide expenses of 200 yuan per month (half for the new and old factories); (15) The dismissed worker representatives should restore the work they originally did on the same day; (16) The company should give gas stoves to the workers in each department for steaming and frying lunch.</p>
<h3>Negotiations on Police Authority in Hongkou; Complications Arise; Even Involving Judicial Issues; No Hope of Reaching an Agreement Temporarily</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council has been unable to implement police authority in Hongkou. In March of this year, the Council negotiated with the Japanese side to return the police authority. The Japanese side argued that areas such as North Sichuan Road and Dixiwei Road in District E are where the Japanese congregate and that Japanese people should be police chiefs. The Shanghai Municipal Council did not insist on this point either. The Japanese Consul-General and the Shanghai Municipal Council reached an agreement. Months have passed since then, and it has still not been realized. According to those who know the inside story, there are also judicial issues involved. The opinions of the Shanghai Municipal Council and the Japanese side differ, and the dispute is unresolved, which is a major reason for the failure to implement it. The negotiations have now stalled, and it is feared that it will be difficult to restore police authority north of the Suzhou River for a while.</p>
<h3>Chapellain Arrives in Haiphong; Inspects Yunnan-Vietnam Postal Transport; Negotiates Parcel Transport on That Route</h3>
<p>After the coastal ports of Vietnam and Zhejiang and Fujian were all blockaded, parcels and heavy items have all stopped being accepted. The Postal Service will appeal the issue, hoping to restore the delivery of parcels and heavy items to the inland via Vietnam or elsewhere. According to the Postal Service, it will do its best to take all hopeful measures to facilitate restoration. However, all specific decisions must wait until Director Chapellain arrives in Shanghai to make them. Mr. Chapellain recently inspected the highway in Haiphong, which may be related to the restoration of parcel transport.</p>

<h3>Gangsters Hijacking Cars One After Another; Car Rental Companies Suffer Heavy Losses; Vehicles Falling into the Hands of Gangsters Are Rarely Returned; This Kind of Danger Needs to be Prevented</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that, in recent weeks, a new threat has gradually emerged in the social life of this city, that is, armed gangsters are hijacking taxis one after another, causing car rental companies to feel anxious. After the gangsters hijacked the cars and used them for various crimes, some cars were returned, but</p>
<p>Hijacked vehicles Mostly Disappear Without a Trace and Have Not Been Found. Based on the current exchange rate, the value of hijacked cars is quite large, so various car rental companies feel that if they continue to suffer this kind of loss, they may be forced to close down. In the past three weeks, three cars from the Xiang Sheng Company were hijacked, one of which has been returned, and the other two are still missing.</p>
<p>Estimated Losses About 30,000 Yuan. The Taile Company has also lost two cars in recent weeks, and it is not difficult for gangsters to hijack cars, so it is urgent to find a way to remedy this. It is suggested that a signal light be installed on the car. If the driver suspects that the passenger is behaving improperly, he can turn on the light to prompt the police to pay attention, while not arousing the passenger's suspicion. Various rental companies feel that if the gangsters find that they can continue to hijack cars and</p>
<p>Go Scot-Free , Then They Will Hijack Indefinitely. This Kind of Danger is a Deep Concern for Car Rental Companies. Gangsters Hijack Cars Mostly at Night, So It Is Not Easy to be Arrested. Therefore, It is also suggested that Police be dispatched to remote locations to constantly patrol and carefully inspect the vehicles, and they must be especially careful at night in order to solve this problem. Once a Car Falls into the Hands of Gangsters, it is even more difficult to find.</p>
<h3>The Case of the Head Nurse's Sudden Death: Dispute Over Possessions; Family Insists on Returning Possessions, Hospital Asks to Deduct Debts</h3>
<p>Li Yuying, also known as Li Jieru, the head nurse of the Sino-Western Sanitarium at 536 Route Ghisi, in the French Concession, suddenly died in her bedroom at the hospital on the night of June 10, the Dragon Boat Festival by the lunar calendar. The next day, it was discovered that Lu Zhenqing, the steward of the hospital (son of the hospital director Lu Zhong'an), did not report the death to the police according to regulations, nor did he seek the family's consent. Instead, he instructed Lin Zhengliang, a Western doctor at the hospital, to issue a certificate stating death due to stroke, notified the Chinese Funeral Home, sent a hearse to the funeral home for coffin preparation, and planned for burial in the Hongqiao Cemetery. All of this was arranged by Zhang on his behalf, without allowing the family to intervene. After someone sent a letter to the French Concession police to report the matter, the coffin was sent to the coroner's office, and a request was made to the Second Special District Court to send personnel to open the coffin for examination and to take the stomach for testing. The Second Special District Court Prosecutor's Office, considering that Lu Zhenqing and Lin Zhengliang had forged the death certificate, recently had Zhao Changmin,</p>
<p>the prosecutor, issue summons for Lu and Lin to appear in court for questioning. Lu was ordered to pay 1,000 yuan in cash, and Lin was ordered to pay 800 yuan in cash. In addition, each had to provide a guarantor to ensure their availability for questioning as needed. As for the 8,700 yuan in cash, four gold bracelets, over 200 pieces of clothing, and other items left by the deceased, Lu was instructed to hand them over to the deceased's father, Li Shizhen, for receipt. These details have already been reported in this newspaper. Now, Lu Zhenqing claims that the deceased owed the hospital over 10,000 yuan during her lifetime and that the family must settle the account before the possessions can be returned. Otherwise, the money from the possessions will be used to offset the debt. This has led to a stalemate between the two parties. The family has again submitted a petition to the Second Special District Court Prosecutor's Office, requesting a strict order to return the clothing and cash. Therefore, yesterday morning, the prosecutor again issued summons for Lu Zhenqing, Lin Zhengliang, and the deceased's parents, Li Shizhen and Madam Li Lin, to appear in court for questioning. One side insisted on an order for the return of the money and possessions, while the other maintained that the account must be settled before the items can be handed over. The court ordered both parties to negotiate a settlement outside. Regarding the criminal aspect, it is heard that the Prosecutor's Office intends to prosecute for the crime of forging documents. If the hospital insists on refusing to return the possessions, the family will file a lawsuit for embezzlement and request their return.</p>
<h3>Scorching Weather, Cholera Outbreak, Authorities Urged to Pay Attention</h3>
<p>Recently, the scorching weather has led to the spread of infectious diseases. Since the beginning of this month, there has been almost one cholera case per day. On the 17th alone, nine people suddenly contracted cholera and were sent to the Isolation Hospital for treatment.

<h3>Bombing Thugs, Trial Not Held Yesterday</h3>
<p>On the morning of the 16th of this month, at around 9:00 AM, a bomb was suddenly thrown at the business department downstairs of the Shen Bao newspaper office on Hankou Road. It exploded at the time, resulting in the death of one person and injuries to eighteen others. The culprit, Wang Biaoqing (also known as A Biao, 33 years old), a Ningbo native, was apprehended and taken back to the police station. Under interrogation, Wang confessed to participating in the bombing and led Chinese and Western detectives to the scene of the incident to demonstrate. He also accompanied detectives from the French Concession police to search Wang's residence at 10 Yongfu Lane, Glock Road, in the French Concession. A badge of the "East Asia Anti-Communist League," numbered 1093, was found and confiscated, along with his concubine, Xu A'e, a Ningbo native. Both were taken back to the police station. Yesterday morning, the police once escorted the male and female suspects to the First Special District Court, but due to some issue, they were not brought before the court and were instead taken back separately for continued investigation.</p>
<h3>Tongchang Customs Brokerage Accused of Embezzling Goods</h3>
<p>Mao Zhiyue, the owner of Xie Xingxiang General Store in Sanguang Town, Northwest Chongming, came to Shanghai in April to purchase soda ash, Jiangping paper, other paper, and various colored foreign cloths. He entrusted Ni Rongshen, who runs Tongchang Customs Brokerage at 5 Xingye Lane, Tiantang Street, to handle customs clearance and ship the goods on the Zhejiang Maru to Narmen Port, Chongming for delivery. However, upon arrival in Chongming, one piece of miscellaneous cloth was missing. Mao immediately came to Shanghai to negotiate with Ni, but Ni kept delaying and refusing to resolve the matter. Therefore, Mao hired a lawyer to file a private prosecution against Ni Rongshen, the owner of Tongchang Customs Brokerage, in the Criminal Division of the Second Special District Court for embezzlement of business goods, requesting that he be investigated according to the law and that the goods be recovered. This case was heard yesterday afternoon by Judge Sun Pengxian. The defendant, accompanied by his defense attorney Yu Enliang, appeared in court and claimed that he had not embezzled the goods and that he had reported and loaded all the goods for export at the time. He stated that after receiving the plaintiff's letter, he had already contacted the shipping company to investigate. He also presented evidence. The court verified the statements and ordered the defendant to post bail, rescheduling the hearing for 3:00 PM on the 29th.</p>

<h3>Doctor and Nurse in Love, Suddenly Attacked by Bandits; Doctor Fights Back, Injured in the Head; One Bandit Apprehended, Awaiting Investigation</h3>
<p>Cao Minzhuo, a doctor from Hubei Province at the China Obstetrics Hospital at 149 Wuzhou Road, Hongkou, and his girlfriend, Chen Shangyi (21 years old, from Hangzhou, said to be a nurse at the hospital), went to Zhaofeng Garden on Jessfield Road in Western Shanghai for a walk on the afternoon of the other day. Until 10:00 PM, the two were still in the garden, sitting together in a secluded,</p>
<p>shaded spot, talking intimately. Unexpectedly, a jarring incident occurred. Two bandits, Zheng Suocai and Sun Jingen, were hiding a brick-made, black imitation pistol in Zhaofeng Park, intending to rob people. Seeing that there was no one else around Cao and Chen, they stepped forward. Zheng pulled out the fake pistol, threatening to make a scene, while Sun stood behind to watch. Just as they were about to search for valuables, Cao, with his sharp eyes, noticed that the pistol was fake. He resisted, but Cao was weak and</p>
<p>was struck on the head by the bandits. Chen, seeing this, was frightened and screamed loudly. A Chinese constable from the 271st Division arrived and apprehended Zheng Suocai. Sun escaped. Zheng and the fake pistol were taken back to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Second Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. Attorney Li Zhishan from the police station stated the above situation, stating that the case required investigation and requesting a postponement. Cao Minzhuo and Chen Shangyi also filed a complaint about everything. Judge Xiao ordered the case to be rescheduled for seven days for further review. The defendant was remanded in custody.</p>
<h3>A Pedestrian Shot on Rue Belliot, Western Shanghai</h3>

<h3>Madam Chen Du Sues Her Husband's Brother for Assault</h3>
<p>Chen Du, a woman from Jiading, wife of Chen Songquan (currently working at the Chung Hwa Book Company in Hong Kong), who resides at 3 Mitsubishi Lane, Kangji Lane, Rue Cardinal Foch, recently hired attorney Zhou Lianze to file a lawsuit in the Criminal Division of the Second Special District Court. She is suing her husband's brother, Chen Shouqing (residing at 403 Fuzhou Road), and fellow townsmen Zhou Liuyi (residing at 105 Route Lafayette) and Xu Yongfu (residing at 379 Caishi Road) for gathering a crowd to assault and injure her, requesting that they be investigated according to the law. It is claimed that the plaintiff is the sister-in-law of the first defendant. The plaintiff and the first defendant jointly opened a printing shop, Chen Zhengtai, at 130 Kangji Lane, Rue Cardinal Foch, with a business office at 403 Fuzhou Road. Living expenses were paid by the first defendant. Recently, because the plaintiff's husband was far away in Hong Kong and her child was ill, she urgently needed money and asked the first defendant for assistance, but he insisted that she and her husband both agree before he would pay. The plaintiff, in desperation, argued with him and scolded him slightly. The first defendant held a grudge and, at around 10:00 AM on July 10, gathered over twenty male and female hoodlums along with the second and third defendants and broke into the plaintiff's residence. Under the direction of the first defendant, they violently beat the plaintiff, causing her injuries. After the neighbor, Chen Shaoshan, the fourth uncle, blew a whistle, the defendants scattered downstairs. The first defendant then raised a stick and struck her, and used broken glass to injure his own face, intending to harm the plaintiff. These circumstances were witnessed by Lu Caifeng and others. The police were called and brought the defendants to the police station, preventing further harm. The defendants' actions were arrogant and clearly violated Article 277 of the Criminal Code on assault. A request is made for a strict investigation according to the law. Upon receiving the complaint, the court heard the case yesterday by Judge Song Chuzhe. The plaintiff and her attorney appeared in court and recounted the previous events. When questioned, the defendants admitted to the assault without denying it. The court ordered the case to be rescheduled for further questioning on the 29th.</p>

<h3>Shaoxing Situation Unchanged, Relief Efforts Continue</h3>
<p>According to news received by the Shaoxing Native Association, the situation in Shaoxing is still very peaceful. Although the Shaoxing Native Association has not received any telegrams from Shaoxing, the telegram exchanges and business activities of Shaoxing merchants in Shanghai with Shaoxing are normal. Several merchants have received private telegrams stating "Shaoxing is safe." As for the situation in Xiaoshan, because the central and northern districts of the area have fallen into Japanese hands, the remaining eastern, western, and southern districts have been affected to some extent, but the overall situation is still peaceful. Therefore, the Shaoshan Relief Society and the Shaoshan Grain Price Stabilization Committee, managed by the Shaoxing Native Association, are continuing their work as usual. The disaster relief society was formally established last week and is continuing to purchase rice and distribute porridge in areas such as Shunyang in central Zhejiang. However, the rice shortage in the Shaoxing area remains severe, with broken rice still priced at over 120 yuan per stone. The Shaoshan Grain Price Stabilization Committee has scheduled Shaoxing opera performances at the Carlton Theatre on Jing'an Temple Road on the evenings of August 1st and 2nd, with all proceeds from ticket sales going towards grain price stabilization donations. It will also hold a charity sale of calligraphy and paintings at the Sincere Company on Nanjing Road.</p>

<h3>Marital Knowledge: Dedicated to the Husbands of the Era; Love is Also a Struggle</h3>
<p>— Co-authored by Yao Chongpei, American Medical Doctor, and Zhan Nianceng, Venereal Disease Specialist</p>
<p>(Clinic) 2nd Floor, China United Trust Company, Intersection of Beijing Road and Sichuan Road</p>
<p>(Hours) 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM; Closed Sundays</p>
<p>In this era of intense competition, what is displayed everywhere is nothing but a state of struggle. What is humility and courtesy? These are nothing but the groans of the weak for self-consolation, and also beautiful terms used by the strong to suppress the weak. Look! Those who lack energy are being eliminated one by one, especially men who lack energy, it is even more difficult to find a wife! This is a recent fact: There is a certain gentleman who, hating his wife's promiscuity and adultery, repeatedly advised her to change but she would not, so he angrily killed her and was soon arrested. There is also a certain gentleman who, after several years of marriage, had a harmonious love life, but because his wife frequented dance halls and singing houses, attracting all sorts of admirers, she gradually began to regard her husband as worthless. Due to quarrels in bed, the husband suddenly had the idea of abandoning the world and drowned himself in the sea! As for other cases of separation, divorce, running away, suicide, catching adultery, and killing wives due to the wife's infidelity, they are too numerous to mention in today's society. Why does life fall into such a tragic state? Heavens! Isn't this humanity's heinous sin?</p>
<p>In fact, smart husbands of the era also have better ways to deal with promiscuous wives. Why do we study women's promiscuity? It must be because of dissatisfaction with their sex life; or they use sex as a tool to obtain living resources. Well, other men can give her satisfaction, so why can't her husband give her satisfaction? As for using sex as a tool, the husband should take responsibility for providing food and clothing. A hungry person thinks of food, a thirsty person thinks of drink, and when one is sexually hungry and thirsty, they will want to find private pleasure elsewhere. This is also a natural principle. If a husband is physically strong and full of energy, he can immediately bring his wife into a state of pleasure and make her realize the preciousness of her own husband. Even a promiscuous wife can be persuaded to eliminate evil thoughts and be completely loyal to her husband. Therefore, the best way to treat a promiscuous wife is to cultivate your own energy and be better than her lover in your sex life. Then she will surely dedicate her whole body and mind to you wholeheartedly. Perhaps this kind of wife will make you the happiest, otherwise, what else will she do?</p>
<p>However, if a man has committed masturbation, nocturnal emission, or early marriage and indulgence, or sought pleasure with prostitutes in his early years, and has damaged the reproductive glands that control his sexual health, then symptoms such as spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, impotence, incomplete development, thin sperm and infertility, and neurasthenia are inevitable. Such husbands not only have unattractive appearances and premature aging, failing to arouse their wives' love, but also have fleeting sexual lives, or even complete impotence. How can a passionate wife not feel heartbroken and stage a tragedy between husband and wife? To seek a remedy, the disease must be cured from the root. According to famous doctors around the world and my experience, taking the gonadal hormone preparation "Sheng Zhi Su" is the most effective treatment. After taking this preparation, it produces sperm and nourishes the kidneys, strengthens the brain and invigorates the blood within a day and night. Taking it continuously in summer has an even more certain and rapid effect. If taken for a whole season, it can also promote development and nourish the nerves. Not only can the above-mentioned symptoms be completely cured, but it can also prolong life and rejuvenate. However, those with nocturnal emission must also take the world-renowned holy medicine for treating nocturnal emission, "Ximitos' Semen-Consolidating Tablets" (available in major Chinese and Western pharmacies such as Wu Zhou) to strengthen the seminal vesicle and prevent leakage of sperm for even faster results!</p>
<h3>Nocturnal Emission Must Be Cured Early</h3>
<p>— Venereal Disease Specialist Zhan Nianceng</p>
<p>A smart person prevents problems before they happen, an ordinary person locks the stable door after the horse is stolen. If one repeatedly delays, knowing about the disease but failing to treat it, ultimately harming oneself and others, this is the most foolish thing in the world! Young people lack knowledge and have weak willpower. They may commit masturbation, lascivious thoughts, or same-sex love and other base behaviors due to momentary curiosity or being seduced. If they can recognize their mistakes and change, they can still be forgiven! However, most young people, once they enter this trap, linger and forget to return. This damages their sexual nerves and relaxes the seminal vesicle, and the terrible nocturnal emission becomes unavoidable.</p>
<p>As soon as one has nocturnal emission, those with a little reason will immediately realize it. At this early stage of nocturnal emission, treatment is easier to begin. At this time, if one takes the German old brand special medicine for treating nocturnal emission, "Ximitos' Semen-Consolidating Tablets", it can consolidate the seminal vesicle and calm the nerves, and will surely achieve the effect of the medicine curing the disease. However, most confused young people do not care about nocturnal emission even after suffering from it. Over the years, the symptoms of nocturnal emission worsen, turning into spermatorrhea. There are also those who suffer from brain weakness, memory loss, insomnia, palpitations, lower back pain, premature ejaculation, impotence, incomplete development, and premature aging due to sperm depletion and blood exhaustion. Such young people are bound to be pale and thin, exhausted, timid, and demoralized. Students will surely fail their grades and may be held back or drop out. Those engaged in agriculture, industry, or commerce also feel the difficulty of being competent and are in danger of losing their jobs. They are even more disliked by women in the realm of love, suffering unrequited love, heartbreak, and falling into a tragic state of life! If they are married, the marriage is in name only, with husband and wife sleeping in the same bed but dreaming different dreams. Not only is it difficult to harmonize the joy of marital relations, but there is also the possibility of infertility and no descendants. The future is bleak and full of suffering! However, in today's era of advanced medicine, there is still a remedy. In addition to continuing to actively take "Ximitos' Semen-Consolidating Tablets," one must also take the gonadal hormone preparation "Sheng Zhi Su" to fundamentally nourish the brain, kidneys, sperm, blood, and nerves. Continued use will surely cure all symptoms and improve health in a short period of time. If patients can come to our clinic for the latest treatments such as electrotherapy, injections, and surgery, a complete cure can be guaranteed.</p>
<p>Fitness</p>
<h3>Breasts are the Medium for Achieving Happiness</h3>
<p>— Yao Chongpei, American Medical Doctor</p>
<p>Apart from the completely "rural" areas, modern men choose their spouses with the other person's "sound physique" as the first priority. As for what their face is like, what their knowledge is, and what their character is like, these are only secondary issues. From the standpoint of us medical experts, this view is considered very important. The entire cause of life, family happiness, and the strength of offspring are all directly and indirectly related to physical fitness. If a wife has a sound physique, then not only can she help her husband start a business and build a family, but in the private life between husband and wife, she has passionate and intense feelings that can make her husband happy and joyful, and his spirit will be infinitely comforted, the family will be full of joy, and she will give birth to clever children, and their happiness will be boundless!</p>
<p>But what kind of woman is considered to have a sound physique? Regarding this point, many people have not yet fully understood, but in the eyes of smart men, this is something that can be known at a glance. Whether a woman's physique is sound or not, it can be known simply by looking at their breasts and buttocks. If a woman's breasts are tall and elastic, and her buttocks are plump and round, then it can be determined that their reproductive gland ovaries are functioning properly. Their metabolism is vigorous, and their whole body is full of new cells, so their physique is naturally sound and free from disease. On the contrary, if the breasts are shriveled and the buttocks are thin, losing their beauty, this means that they are suffering from menstrual irregularities, vaginal discharge, and malnutrition. Even if they have a face as beautiful as a flower or jade, they will be despised by the men of the era, and their fate will be very tragic! To seek a remedy, one can only rely on science. According to famous Chinese and Western doctors and our experience, it is universally recognized that taking the ingredients extracted from gonadal eggs, which are unusually precious, and preparing the non-nest preparation "Female Reproductive Hormone," is the most effective and targeted treatment. Because this preparation is very refined, it can nourish the ovarian function, invigorate metabolism, adjust menstruation, and eliminate all diseases of the uterus within a day and night after taking it. If continued to be taken, it will surely make the breasts tall and the buttocks plump, increase health and beauty, and obtain supreme happiness in a short period of time.</p>
<h3>Ironclad Facts</h3>
<p>— Venereal Disease Specialist Zhan Nianceng</p>
<p>(1) Nocturnal Emission is Recovering</p>
<p>Patient Mr. Ding Xuewen, from Jiangdu, Northern Jiangsu, studied at a school in a certain province. Due to the war, the school moved to Shanghai to resume classes, and Mr. Ding also came to Shanghai with it. He was 19 years old and not yet fully developed. Because he had committed masturbation, his sexual nerves were weakened, and his seminal vesicle was relaxed, leading to nocturnal emission. He had it about two or three times a month. At first, because he did not know the harm, he did not treat it. Recently, the symptoms worsened, and he had nocturnal emission almost every week, causing dizziness, memory loss, and insomnia. He found studying very difficult. He also had lower back pain and was extremely tired after walking a little. He was almost bedridden (all of the above he said himself). Last month, he came to our clinic for treatment. After carefully examining his symptoms, I confirmed that they matched what he said. I instructed him to buy and take the holy medicine for treating nocturnal emission, "Ximitos' Semen-Consolidating Tablets," and the gonadal hormone preparation "Sheng Zhi Su," which is a tonic for the brain, kidneys, and nervous system, at the Chinese and Western Pharmacy. The Semen-Consolidating Tablets were used to strengthen his seminal vesicle and stop the emission, and "Sheng Zhi Su" was used to nourish the brain, kidneys, and nerves. He also received electrotherapy and injections to assist the effect. With these three methods used together, for a month now, all the diseases have suddenly disappeared, and his health has doubled.</p>
<p>(2) Brain Weakness and Kidney Deficiency Almost Ruined His Life</p>
<p>Mr. Chu Yushan, a local, is 26 years old and has been married for three years. Recently, he suddenly suffered from premature ejaculation, impotence, brain weakness, and insomnia. On a beautiful autumn night, there were constant sounds of frustration between the sheets. Mr. Chu is an accountant at a certain company and has also found it difficult to be competent. His future is bleak and full of sorrow! So, he came to me for treatment. I used a method that treats both the symptoms and the root cause. First, I instructed him to buy and take "Sheng Zhi Su" to nourish the kidneys, produce sperm, strengthen the brain, and invigorate the blood. Then, I gave him electrotherapy and injections. Now, just a month and a half later, he feels energetic, his love life is fulfilling, his cheeks are rosy, and he works tirelessly. He is completely different from before!</p>

<h3>Speculation Goes Awry, Foolish Borrowing, Minor Fluctuations in the Gold Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot gold's unofficial market conditions remained stable, though the underlying trend after yesterday's close was quite weak. However, this had no impact today. Many holders felt fortunate and bought in at lower prices, so the price consistently hovered above 5,200 yuan. The opening price was 5,230 yuan. Later, there was a slight dip, but after forceful purchases by money exchange businesses and banks, the price rose to 5,270 yuan. Subsequently, due to reselling by securities firms and money exchange businesses, the price fell back to the 5,200 yuan level. The midday close was 5,210 yuan. The after-hours market started at 5,225 yuan, but banks leaned towards selling, and the price could not withstand a further drop of 20 yuan. Finally, with slight buying by securities firms and money exchange businesses, the market was able to maintain a closing price of 5,220 yuan. The market closed very early, which was due to a lack of discussion and trading. The result was a decline of 20 yuan compared to the previous day. There were more small transactions than large ones, with an estimated total volume of around 2,000 taels. Ornaments gold in gold shops did not move, and customs gold remained flat.</p>
<p>Spot Gold Declines by Another Twenty Yuan</p>
<p>Since this morning, each bar of spot gold initially experienced a slight decline compared to the previous day's closing price due to the slightly looser exchange market. Gold dealers first traded 20 taels at 5,230 yuan. Subsequently, due to selling by money exchange businesses, the price fell another 15 yuan, with money exchange businesses selling 10 taels to gold dealers at a loss of 5,215 yuan. Fortunately, a certain money exchange business aggressively bought at a low price, and at that time, gold dealers and silver shops also followed suit. The price soon rose by 55 yuan, with gold dealers trading 20 taels and the price increasing to 5,270 yuan. Unexpectedly, a certain money exchange business suddenly took profits, and the market trend reversed downwards. Securities firms also turned to selling, and silver shops followed suit, resulting in a sharp drop of 70 yuan. Silver shops sold a total of 50 taels to gold dealers and others, retreating to 5,200 yuan. At noon, a certain money exchange business took advantage of the low price to buy again, leading to a rebound of 20 yuan. In the afternoon, a certain money exchange business first came to search for buys, immediately raising the price by 15 yuan. Money exchange businesses bought 10 taels from gold dealers at 5,225 yuan. Subsequently, silver shops mutually traded 10 taels at 5,205 yuan. Afterwards, money exchange businesses and a certain securities firm successively bought, gradually pushing the price up by 15 yuan. Securities firms bought several dozen taels from silver shops and others, reaching 5,220 yuan, which was the evening closing price. The result was a further decline of 20 yuan compared to the previous day. The overall price range for the day was 70 yuan. The selling price of spot gold by cash shops was ten-odd yuan higher than the quoted price, while the buying price was thirty yuan lower. The current standard gold price was fifty-odd yuan lower than the listed gold price, with little trading activity.</p>
<p>Ornaments Gold Remains Unchanged All Day</p>
<p>The exchange price for ornaments gold per tael at silver shops did not change all day. Da Tong Heng remained at 540 yuan, and Xin Tong Heng's price was similar to the previous price, with a reduction of about 30 yuan for buying in.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currencies Rise Slightly</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw the British and American gold pound decline before returning to previous levels. British gold notes were in slightly higher demand, and the market price rose slightly. American gold notes did not break out of the trading range, initially trading at 16.12 yuan, then gradually rising to 16.25 yuan. In the evening market, it retreated to 16.18 yuan, but it was still better than the previous day by 0.08 yuan. Hong Kong notes still had many buyers, and the market price rose slightly by 0.01 yuan. There were still many suppliers of Japanese gold notes, and the market price continued to fall by 0.008 yuan, with the evening market at 1.212 yuan. The underlying trend for Korean notes remained strong, and the evening market continued to rise to 1.03 yuan.</p>
<h3>Discount Rate Decreases by One Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday's discount rate for exchanged bills decreased slightly. The discount rate was 48 yuan per thousand in the morning and around 50 yuan for selling. In the afternoon, it declined to 49 yuan and neared 47 yuan, down one yuan compared to the previous day. The call loan rate of the money industry association remained unchanged, with both the morning and afternoon markets quoted at 0.18 yuan.</p>
<h3>Securities Internal Bonds Frequently Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday's unofficial market for unified public bonds experienced a further decline due to negative news and increased anxiety among investors. The market sentiment weakened again, and the downward trend felt even stronger. Buying interest declined, and bears seemed to gain the upper hand, so the market price declined with little sign of recovery. Although the market opened weak in the morning, the decline was still slight because Jiu Feng, Xin Chang, and Lian Yi had all bought in. Afterward, the price fell steadily as Heng Fu, Tong Yu, De Fu, and Tong Kang tirelessly sold. The market was quieter in the afternoon, but the downward trend persisted because Liu Hao, Le Mao, No. 20, Tong Shun, and Hong Da successively sold. Fortunately, Jiu Feng, Tong Yu, Lian He, Lian Yi, and Xin Fu absorbed at low prices, so the market rallied slightly. The daily fluctuation resulted in a consistent decline of 0.25 to 0.50 yuan. Trading was still active, with a volume of over 1.3 million yuan. A simplified table is listed on the left.</p>
<p>The Industry Association reported that shares settled at the end of the week were easily absorbed. The underlying trend for various stocks at the close was firm and stable. If the news does not change, the market situation may turn stronger next week.</p>
<p>London, 18th (Thursday) Dispatch - Today's listed prices for Far East British company stocks saw HSBC Bank continue to rise. Stocks registered in England rose by £2, and stocks registered in Hong Kong rose by £1, with both priced at £68. The rest were unchanged.</p>
<p>London, 18th (Thursday) Dispatch - Today's listed prices for Chinese foreign debt remained stable, with no changes in any bonds.</p>
<h3>Grain: Shantou Merchants Import Large Quantities of Road Rice; 10,000 Bags Arrive from Hong Kong; Prices Decline but Struggle to Recover</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market experienced a shift from weakness to tightness. The earlier price declines were substantial, and recovery proved difficult. The market opened weak, with buyers hesitant and sellers eager to unload, causing a drop of 1.5 yuan across various grades of foreign rice. Activity then picked up, and prices rebounded accordingly. However, the market's prolonged weakness and fragile sentiment led to quick exhaustion after any upward movement. The closing statistics showed fluctuations, with prices still slightly lower than the previous day's closing. Grade One Chen Saigon rice was priced at 52 yuan and 51.5 yuan, Grade One Siam rice at 54.5 yuan and 54 yuan, "Fire-milled" rice at 54 yuan and 53.5 yuan, "Small-milled" rice at 52.2 yuan, Tokyo "Pointed" rice at 48 yuan, then down to 45.5 yuan, "Special" rice at 49 yuan, "Rough Pointed" rice at 43.2 yuan and 43 yuan, "Broken Pointed" rice at 41 yuan and 38.5 yuan, "Mi Lu" rice at 42-43 yuan, and "True Special" rice at 44 yuan. Road rice prices dropped by 2.3-2.4 yuan in the morning but recovered by about 1 yuan, ultimately settling slightly lower. Initially, weak and nervous firms sought to sell, followed by speculative hoarders and scattered sellers who reduced prices. Grade Two Saigon rice for June delivery and July arrival opened at only 58.5 yuan, with later higher bids failing to materialize. Grade Two Siam rice, loaded on June 20th, opened as low as 58.8 yuan, a sharp drop of 2.4 yuan from the previous close. Rice loaded on the 26th also opened at 58.8 yuan, down 2.2 yuan. Seizing this weakness, Shantou merchants aggressively bought up rice of both the 20th and 26th loadings. Rice loaded on the 20th rose from 59 yuan and 59.2-59.3 yuan to as high as 60 yuan, while rice loaded on the 26th rose from 59 yuan and 59.3-59.5 yuan to as high as 60.3 yuan, a rebound of 1.2 yuan and 1.5 yuan respectively, only 1.2 yuan and 0.7 yuan lower than the previous close. Total transactions reached 1,400-1,500 tons, mostly pulled in by Shantou merchants. However, it remains unclear whether they paid in cash and shipped the rice.</p>
<p>Foreign rice continues to arrive. Yesterday, the Taikoo Company's "Hubei" vessel brought 10,002 bags from Hong Kong, arriving in Shanghai around 2 p.m. and docking at the company's wharf in Pudong for unloading. The supply of (native) japonica and glutinous rice remains limited, with only about 1,000 bags of japonica rice arriving. Rumors suggest that under-the-table transactions are balancing supply and demand, so prices haven't changed. Chang merchants are offering specially cleaned japonica rice at 66-67 yuan, genuine special japonica rice at 68 yuan, Su-Kun Changzhou white japonica rice ranging from a high of 65 yuan to around 60 yuan for stale rice, Qing-Si thin paddy rice from 65-66 yuan to 63-64 yuan, fresh South Port early rice at 62-63 yuan and stale rice at 60 yuan, fresh Hu-Jian rice at 59 yuan and stale rice at 57-58 yuan, Jin-Li special yuan rice at 62-63 yuan, Chang-Dan white yuan rice from 61.5 yuan to 60.02 yuan, and Hong Kong white yuan rice at 60 yuan and 59 yuan, etc.</p>
<h3>Flour and Wheat: Quiet</h3>
<p>Wheat Flour: Yesterday's flour market was quite quiet. Since the Fuxin mill resumed operations, all mills have generally been able to supply flour. However, mill prices have reached 16 yuan, and foreign rice sells for 55 yuan per stone, so flour seems more expensive than rice, leading to a decline in actual sales. Furthermore, more and more flour shops are bundling sales with inland Japanese-made flour, making the market outlook even less promising. Overall, Chinese mills sold about 5,000 bags. Johnson flour also opened with 4-500 bags. The remaining miscellaneous inland brands and Phoenix brand, etc., are being held back.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday's trading was also quiet. Arrivals in Hongkou were still somewhat active, but only small amounts were transported into the foreign concessions. Because transportation permits from Chinese mills have not yet been issued, purchase enthusiasm is low, and Japanese mills are also demanding high prices, resulting in limited new transactions and a dim market outlook.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains: Three Transactions for Broad Beans</h3>
<p>Trade in miscellaneous grains is hampered by restrictions on both transportation and sales, preventing large-scale transactions. Only small-scale trading was seen in the market. Although there were three transactions for broad beans yesterday, the total volume was less than 600 bags. Sales were still limited to small quantities within the local market. A deal was struck for over 200 bags of Wujiang green-skinned broad beans at 22 yuan, over 280 bags of Beigang green-skinned broad beans at 20.07-20.04 yuan, and over 100 bags of Minhang green-skinned broad beans at 19 yuan.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Sluggish Sales; Sha City Weak</h3>
<p>The yarn market is stagnant and lacks features. Market transactions are greatly reduced due to the narrow scope of speculation, leaving no targets for speculators and hindering activity. Actual sales are also sluggish. However, most operators maintain long positions and are unwilling to sell, creating a stalemate.</p>
<p>Morning prices for yarn opened weak, with foreign exchange rates stable but foreign cotton trending downward, dampening market sentiment. 20-count "Double Horse" yarn opened at 935 yuan, but after a slight dip, a few buyers made purchases, driving the price back up to 945 yuan. However, market transactions were thin, and the closing price was 940 yuan. Rumors circulated after closing, further weakening confidence. Statistics show that 1,050 bales were traded in half a day, and 20-count "Double Horse" yarn fell by 4 yuan. The quantities purchased by various groups were as follows: 185 bales were shipped to Yantai and 70 bales to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Local Traders: 780 bales   Hong Kong: 220 bales</p>
<p>Fuzhou: 40 bales        Inland: 10 bales</p>
<p>Total: 1,050 bales</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Lifeless</h3>
<p>Current cotton trading remains inactive due to the downward trend in U.S. cotton and the unremarkable state of Indian cotton. The slow cotton yarn sales and unstable prices leave factories unenthusiastic, with only a few small transactions. The market lacks vitality.</p>
<p>Further News: Foreign cotton prices in the New York cotton market were very quiet yesterday. Later, sales by spot traders and the closing of some long positions resulted in closing prices falling by over 10 points compared to the previous day. The Indian market was calm, with no significant fluctuations including forecasts yesterday.</p>
<p>Although trading in foreign cotton in Shanghai was quieter yesterday, factories still made some purchases, injecting some life into the market. However, low inventory levels suggest there won't be a large price drop in the cotton market, so traders are generally firm in their positions.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Fluctuating Foreign Sugar Prices</h3>
<p>The sugar market trended flat yesterday, with little fluctuation. The association's standard prices were: spot No. 24 raw white sugar, 67.5 yuan for goods stored at the local warehouse (unchanged), 67.2-67.15 yuan in the morning and 67.4 yuan in the afternoon for goods at other warehouses, 53-52.9 yuan for transshipment goods (down 1-2 yuan), Taikoo "Car White B" at the west warehouse 76.5 yuan (up 0.2 yuan), "HX" at 74.5 yuan, Dutch red sugar at 58 yuan, local factory snow white sugar at 67.5 yuan, No. 1 rock sugar at 88.5 yuan, and crystalline bright ice sugar at 90 yuan. It is reported that ordinary miscellaneous grades of domestic sugar saw slight movement, but prices remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Dried Fruits and Nuts: Walnut and Walnut Meat Prices Rise</h3>
<p>A new batch of walnuts recently arrived and is currently being priced, but prices have not yet been announced. Hand-picked walnuts rose by 5 yuan to 85 yuan, while ordinary Jinan walnuts remained at 60 yuan. Walnut meat also rose by 5 yuan to 190 yuan.</p>
<h3>Vermicelli Prices Continue to Fall</h3>
<p>Vermicelli prices continue to decline due to quiet sales from various merchants. Longkou vermicelli fell by 7 yuan to 108 yuan, and Qingdao vermicelli fell by 5 yuan to 85 yuan. Soup vermicelli is experiencing low arrivals and slow sales with little fluctuation. An upturn is only expected with the arrival of cooler autumn weather.</p>
<h3>Sweet Almonds Plunge in Price</h3>
<p>Sweet almonds are experiencing stagnant sales, with little trading in both high and mid-grade almonds. Northern Mountain almonds previously opened at 330-340 yuan. (Currency Exchange Price, formerly 380 yuan, now selling for 310 yuan, down 70 yuan).</p>
<h3>Coal: Indian Coal Piles Up, But Sales Remain Sluggish</h3>
<p>Since large quantities of Indian Datta smoky coal arrived this week, the warehouses in Pudong are filled to capacity, a rare sight since the war. However, actual sales to factories in this area are sluggish, and merchant purchases are also hindered, causing prices to decline and soften further. One firm's internal price for unified coal warehouse receipts is 210 yuan, but there are few buyers. Block coal from local door-to-door dealers is 240 yuan per ton, delivered to customers, and profit margins have also narrowed.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous: Cigarette Prices Remain Firm</h3>
<p>Over the past few days, black market prices for cigarettes have remained strong. Although there were three sellers, market demand is strong, leading to tight supply. Holders of "British Brand" cigarettes are selling for a profit, with prices up 17 yuan from before. "Great British Brand" opened at 1,008 yuan, "Pin Hai Brand" at 680 yuan, new "Old Knife Brand" at 757 yuan, and old stock at 737 yuan (down 20 yuan). Local "Little Fairy" cigarettes are 480 yuan, and factory sales of "Five Flowers Brand" are limited, leading to tight market supply with prices at 530 yuan. Limited sales are insufficient to meet market demand. (Increased).</p>
<h3>Statistics: Price Changes in June - Hui</h3>
<p>In June, Shanghai's prices, in theory, should have fallen due to increased foreign exchange supply. However, the facts show otherwise. According to the Shanghai Municipal Council's report on the cost of living index for workers, the general index was 422.91, more than 40 points higher than last month, even with sharp foreign exchange declines (i.e., 382.91), reaching an all-time high. The main reason was the sharp rise in rice prices, which supported overall prices and prevented them from falling. This is evident in the categorized index, where the food category index rose sharply from 383.24 in May to 451.74. The miscellaneous category saw limited increases, while clothing and fuel both declined.</p>
<p>A total of 38 price increases from industrial and commercial firms were published in newspapers in June, a decrease of 96 from the previous month. Transportation had the most price increases, with 13 instances, ranking first. Food and beverage and electrical metal industries each had four increases, ranking second. Cultural, daily necessities, and decoration industries each had three increases, ranking third. Medical, civil engineering, packaging, and candle/foil industries each had two increases, ranking last. Analyzing the 38 price increases by commodity category, there were 24 types, with food and beverages and transportation goods each accounting for four types, ranking first. Daily necessities and electrical metal goods each accounted for three types, ranking second. Cultural, medical, packaging, and candle/foil goods each accounted for two types, ranking third. Civil engineering and decoration goods each accounted for one type, ranking last. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Cold Drinks: Ice blocks rose to 1.6 yuan each, ice-filled sweet cups sold for 0.5 yuan, large purple ice cream bars were 0.5 yuan each, "White Snow Princess" and "Taiji Consort" bars were 0.5 yuan each, small purple ice cream bars were 0.25 yuan each, and ice essence sticks were 0.1 yuan each (Hai Ning Foreign Firm).

<h3>Old News Re-Copied: 67 Years Ago (450) (See Shen Bao from the 12th Year of the Tongzhi Reign of the Late Qing Dynasty)</h3>
<p>Ancient Methods of Locust Control</p>
<p>The locusts that were left behind from the previous year hatch from their eggs in the spring and summer. When they come, their momentum is sudden and unstoppable. They fly and obscure the sky, almost darkening the sunlight. The places where they stop seem to be fixed, either passing through without stopping, or nesting in the fields without eating, or voraciously gnawing in the wild, almost destroying the seedlings. It is as if in the darkness, there is a force driving them. Farmers who encounter them are helpless and can only sigh at the edge of the fields, leaving it to natural disasters. However, local officials must take the people's affairs as their own concern and find ways to capture them. There are three main methods: First, when the locusts are newly born, dig them up and cut off their roots, so that they do not stir. Second, order the children and women of the people to search and capture them in the four villages and send them to the county for purchase at a price. Pour them to death on the spot, or burn them with firewood. The government donates funds to provide the price, so that the villagers will diligently capture them. As the villagers can obtain a small profit, they will all rise up to capture them, and the plague of locusts can also be suppressed. Third, when the locusts first arrive and have not yet gathered in the fields, quickly burn them with fire. Order all the servants and gather the garrison soldiers to search and capture them in the villages, and they must be completely exterminated before stopping. This does not rely on the people's power. However, although all three of these methods can eliminate the plague of locusts, when they fly and obscure the sky and gather in the four fields, it is impossible to capture them all. Subsequently, a thunderstorm or a strong wind may blow them away at once, or they may fly across the water and drown, so the autumn harvest may still be unaffected. This is also because Heaven does not cut off the people's food and then brings this about.</p>

<p>Short Talk</p>
<h3>Unrighteous Wealth</h3>
<p>— Editor</p>
<p>Mr. Wenzi wrote to us, saying that a friend of his, Mr. Someone, works at a certain company and earns a meager salary. With the alarming rise in prices, he relies entirely on his past savings, the limited hard-earned money, to support the expenses of his family of several people. Now, a friend in a gambling organization is willing to find him a nominal position, with a monthly income that can maintain his family's livelihood and his children's education expenses. However, Mr. Someone "believes that this is unearned wealth, which he feels ashamed to receive, and is unrighteous wealth, which is even more detrimental to his conscience and damaging to his character." Therefore, he is a little hesitant; but on second thought, "Since he is not doing anything for them, and it is not too much to share a little in the unrighteous profits, not to mention that it can greatly help the lives of good people and the education expenses of the younger generation." Therefore, he is hesitant and wants us to express our opinion.</p>
<p>We believe that this world can be divided into two major camps, light and darkness, and the forces of these two camps are constantly fighting. People in the world must either participate in the work of light or participate in the work of darkness. There is absolutely no possibility of neutrality or sitting on the fence.</p>
<p>Since it comes from an unrighteous place, it is unrighteous wealth. Since it is unrighteous wealth, no matter where it is used or what fancy name is added to it, it is still unrighteous wealth. The place for educating children is not necessarily limited to schools; parents' every move is the most fundamental educational model. If you first inject the toxins of "unearned wealth" and "taking unrighteous wealth" into the minds of your children, and then ask them to receive school education, the result will be more harmful than beneficial to society; if your children "know", they would definitely rather drop out of school.</p>
<p>Mencius said it well, 'Life is what I desire, and righteousness is also what I desire; if I cannot have both, I will give up life and take righteousness!' Moreover, this is not a matter of life and death.</p>

<h3>Malignant Tumor</h3>
<p>— Cao Lingyou</p>
<p>When we talk about malignant tumors (Cancer), everyone may turn pale with fear. This is not surprising, because malignant tumors often lead to death, especially for those who are quite old, more die because of malignant tumors that cannot be cured! In today's scientifically advanced America, according to statistics, more than 150,000 people die from malignant tumors every year. Apart from death due to heart disease, malignant tumors can be said to be the number one killer.</p>
<p>Why do so many people die from malignant tumors? Is a malignant tumor an incurable disease? Malignant tumors are not like influenza and other diseases, which are caused by infection, nor are they caused by certain germs. The cause of malignant tumors can be said to be the continuous growth of toxic, disordered cells within the patient's own body! The most annoying thing about it is that early malignant tumors often do not show any special symptoms until the tumor has grown to a considerable extent in the patient's body and is discovered. At that time, it can be said to be too late. Not only is there no way to remove the tumor, but the tumor cells in the body will spread to other parts, and as a result, death finally comes.</p>
<p>If we usually pay attention to our bodies and go to the doctor immediately if any part of our body feels uncomfortable, and ask him to give you a full body check, it will not be difficult to find out if there is a malignant tumor in the body. If an early malignant tumor is found, with today's medical power, there is hope of a cure.</p>
<p>To date, doctors only have two methods for treating early malignant tumors: the first is to burn the tumor with radium or X-rays. The second is to perform surgery to cut out the tumor.</p>
<p>What methods should we use to prevent the growth of malignant tumors? In addition to cooperating with doctors and having regular health checkups, we must keep the body, face, skin, mouth, tongue, teeth, etc. clean, and avoid eating foods that make you feel uncomfortable. We must practice self-control, not drink excessive alcohol, not smoke too many cigarettes, and avoid prolonged constipation.</p>
<p>Malignant tumors can be said to be prevalent all year round and extremely fierce! The number of people who die from it every year cannot be counted. If you have reasonable prevention, then you can avoid repeating unnecessary deaths!</p>
<p>Essay</p>
<h3>Sleepless Night</h3>
<p>— Xu Yi</p>
<p>Sir, have you ever suffered from insomnia on a hot summer night? That kind of experience unique to marginal people can only be understood by marginal people who have personally tasted the taste of insomnia.</p>
<p>In a cage-like cubicle, in the midst of a chorus of snores all around, under the control of a black devil's hand, while opening powerless eyes, experiencing the taste of insomnia, searching for the lost old dream, like the ancient fisherman groping for the old path to the Peach Blossom Spring.</p>
<p>And I am also very much like that fisherman, I was finally rejected outside the land of sleep, and leisurely, a unique "consideration" blocked my way.</p>
<p>I cannot remove this "consideration", nor do I want to discard this "consideration", so I have always been standing outside the frontier, I have always been awake; although I also know how comfortable and peaceful the land of sleep is.</p>
<p>Under the protection of the dark night, bedbugs boldly suck people's blood, people are gradually getting thinner, but the blood-sucking insects are rapidly becoming fat, and multiplying doubly, the whole room is full of guys who only know how to suck people's blood!</p>
<p>This terrible thing is only known to those who suffer from insomnia; and those who are trapped in the land of dreams, at most, only move a few times unconsciously.</p>
<p>Turn over, the surroundings are still full of ignorant snores; I open my eyes, I still open my eyes. Faced with this pitch-black sleepless night, I fall into bottomless sorrow.</p>
<p>Sir, have you ever suffered from insomnia on a hot summer night? That kind of experience unique to marginal people can only be understood by marginal people who have personally tasted the taste of insomnia.</p>
<p>Hawthorne's Case</p>
<h3>The Destination Behind the Dance</h3>
<p>— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter Three: Conflicting Information</p>
<p>Hawthorne still asked in a self-absorbed manner, "Why did you go out alone for dinner yesterday?" Old Mao replied righteously, "There is naturally a reason for that. Last night I wanted to go to the theater, and dinner here is always around eight o'clock. The theater opens very early, so I naturally couldn't wait. So I went out around seven o'clock, had dinner at Zhengyu Restaurant first, and then went to the Tiansheng Stage. Last night, the Tiansheng Stage performed the full version of 'Iron Rooster,' and the scenery and mechanisms were very exciting. If you don't believe me, there is still a program in my room. I'll go get it." He turned around as if to leave.</p>
<p>Hawthorne stopped him and said, "Wait, don't go get it for now. I'm asking you, why were you in such a good mood last night that you went to the theater alone?"</p>
<p>Old Mao said, "It's not about whether I'm in a good mood or not. Miss Wang gave me a theater ticket, that's why I went to see it."</p>
<p>Hawthorne's eyes flashed again, as if he had inadvertently discovered another clue. He took two puffs of his cigarette, calmed himself down, and still maintained his composure, continuing to ask.</p>
<p>"Miss Wang gave you this ticket? Does she often give you tickets?" Old Mao said, "I can't say often, last night was the second time. Last Sunday night, she also gave me one." "Do you know where she got the tickets? Did someone give them to her?"</p>
<p>Old Mao frowned again, as if he was having difficulty answering. "I don't know for sure. But yesterday's ticket, it seemed—" "It seemed what?"</p>
<p>"It seemed like she bought it specifically. Because around three o'clock yesterday afternoon, someone rode a bicycle to deliver a letter. I took it in, and there was something hard in the envelope, like a theater ticket."</p>
<p>"Did he pay?"</p>
<p>"No. She has acquaintances in every theater, and she never has to pay immediately when she calls to buy tickets. Half an hour after the letter was delivered, Miss Wang came downstairs and gave me the ticket."</p>
<p>"What did she say to you then?"</p>
<p>Old Mao shook his head and said, "She didn't say anything. She just said, 'There's nothing to do at home tonight, go out for a walk.' Of course, I was very happy to accept." (50)</p>
<h3>New</h3>
<p>— Yang Huashi</p>
<p>Let's bury all the old things, we are pursuing the new!</p>
<p>New is the most beautiful thing in the world, it is the life of the universe, it contains great, pure, and bright elements, it drives away all that is base, troubled, and dark.</p>
<p>People who move forward should all excavate in the new, it makes us walk on a wide and smooth road, it defeats the "enemy of success" for us.</p>
<p>There is a force in the torrent of the times that makes people love the new. Everything in the world is progressing, becoming newer day by day. Who can be satisfied with everything they have? Perfection is what people hope for. People will get sick if they don't breathe fresh air, and they will fall behind if they don't seek in the new.</p>
<p>Some people say: people's lives must be close to the "new" in order not to feel lonely and depressed, and to have perfect achievements.</p>
<p>Strive to walk on the new road, do not be infatuated with all the old things, living a decadent, comfortable, and anesthetized life, this is doomed to destruction. We are not afraid of difficulties, we work hard to improve, work hard to create, and strengthen our strength.</p>
<p>Friends, please remember, we must get new nourishment in order to enrich the value of life.</p>
<h3>Repentance of the City of Nineveh</h3>
<p>Nineveh was the ancient capital of Assyria, holding a leading position in culture, commerce, politics, and economics. Unfortunately, it was full of sin, engaging in all kinds of filth, leading to its own destruction and offending the Lord. A sinner without God's salvation, his heart is like the city of Nineveh, filled with nothing but "evil thoughts, murder, adultery, fornication, theft, false witness, and slander...".</p>
<p>Nineveh's wickedness was overflowing, and God had only two options to deal with it. One was to uphold justice and punish the city according to its sins, destroying it. The other? To show mercy, not condemning past sins, and saving the city. God is love and could not bear the destruction of the city, so He sent the prophet Jonah to proclaim His way of salvation. Likewise, you who are not saved by God also have only two destinies: (1) destruction according to sin, (2) salvation through faith. But I do not want you to be unaware that although your sins are like scarlet crimson, God still loves you, and God wants to save you. He sent His only begotten Son, Jesus Christ, into the world precisely to save sinners.</p>
<p>When Nineveh heard the salvation proclaimed by Jonah, they believed in God, put on sackcloth and ashes, grieved for their sins, fasted, prayed, and asked God for forgiveness. They also turned away from evil deeds and abandoned violence, showing that they had truly repented. When God saw that they had truly repented, He forgave them and saved Nineveh. Christ Jesus is greater than Jonah. He not only proclaimed salvation but also died on the cross for our sins, rose from the dead after three days, ascended to heaven after forty days, and now still intercedes for you and me at the right hand of God. Do you want to escape the punishment of sin and receive God's salvation? Sincerely repent and accept Jesus Christ as your Savior, and you will be saved. Today is the day for you to repent, because tomorrow is not yours; you do not know. Friends! Wake up!</p>

<h3>Li Qinian Departed from Hong Kong Yesterday, Scheduled to Arrive in Shanghai on the 22nd</h3>
<p>— Ling</p>
<p>The Chinese film industry lacks talent and urgently needs new blood, which is generally acknowledged. Therefore, in recent years, film companies have spared no effort in seeking new talent. Chen Yunshang, who rose to prominence with Xinhua, is shining brightly in the entire silver screen under this principle.</p>
<p>Recently, Li Qinian, who has been promoted by Yi Hua Company for a long time, is also a silver star famous in Hong Kong, just like Chen Yunshang. Although Li Qinian has not yet made a deep impression on the audience in Shanghai, they have all been impressed.</p>

<p>According to Yi Hua Company's claim: the Jinmen Hotel is now temporarily designated as Li Qinian's residence, and then find a suitable residence. As for the films that Li Qinian will star in, two have also been decided, one is a costume drama, and the other is a modern drama, but the film names are temporarily kept secret.</p>
<h3>Hollywood Snippets</h3>
<p>— Luo Cun</p>
<p>(1) Clark Gable has not starred in any new films recently, so he is studying flying techniques diligently, preparing to fly his own plane to Canada for a long trip in the near future, and his wife Carole Lombard may accompany him.</p>
<p>(2) Deanna Durbin will enter the University of Southern California this fall to study political science.</p>
<p>(3) Ann Sheridan became a mother in early summer this year.</p>
<p>(4) Joe E. Brown purchased more than six acres of land in San Tan Prairie, preparing to open a polomite planting field and set aside a small part as his own resting place.</p>
<p>(5) Rosemary, one of the Lane Sisters, has announced her commitment to celibacy to avoid outside rumors.</p>
<p>(6) Robert Montgomery, with the permission of the French government, has returned to Hollywood and will star in "The Seahorse".</p>
<p>(7) Miguel Rolando has been writing scripts recently, preparing for his directorial debut.</p>

<p>(9) Jeanette MacDonald's husband, Gene Raymond, will return to the screen.</p>
<p>(10) Colman has moved to Elston, less than twenty miles from Hollywood.</p>
<h3>Hu Rongrong Retires from the Film Circle</h3>
<p>— Xing</p>
<p>At present, our country's film industry lacks child stars. Apart from Chen Juanjuan, Yan Fenghuang, and Hu Rongrong, there seems to be none. There is only Mou Ling, but Mou Ling has been out of the film circle for a long time.</p>
<p>Chen Juanjuan is now filming at Xinhua, Yan Fenghuang is working at Guohua, and only Hu Rongrong is still in turmoil. A while ago, both Guolian and Guohua companies had contacted Rongrong's father and brother, intending to invite her to film, but at that time, Rongrong's father and brother declined because she was not feeling well.</p>
<p>Yesterday, because of some small matter, the reporter went to Hu Rongrong's residence and met her father and brother, Hu Shaoyu and Hu Xinling. The reporter casually asked about Rongrong's filming plans, what were her plans?</p>
<p>"Because today's film industry tends towards the low-level themes of folk tales, we seem to feel very saddened by the film, and even more so, the phenomenon of open and secret struggles between film merchants is really an undesirable phenomenon, so we are not prepared to let Rongrong continue her filming..." These were Mr. Shaoyu's words.</p>
<p>"...For movie fans, it is considered a very honorable thing to make movies, but for those who have lived under the mercury lamps, it feels as indifferent as doing other things. Therefore, my father and I once discussed that we will never let Rongrong live the silver screen life again," said Hu Xin.</p>
<p>"So does Rongrong herself like to make movies?"</p>
<p>"Actually, the child is indifferent. She doesn't understand whether making movies is good or bad at all. From our observation, she doesn't seem to have a strong interest in movies."</p>
<p>In this way, Rongrong is sure not to be active on the screen again.</p>
