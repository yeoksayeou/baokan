<p>社評</p>
<h3>英美最近的舉動與中國</h3>
<p>紐約時報昨日評論國際最新趨勢，以爲歐洲與亞洲的兩組戰事，終究是一個戰爭；他以英美兩國近來的活動，以及歐亞兩戰皆由侵略與反侵略所促成，爲之明證。如此論斷，自有其根據，且可視爲有益於抗戰中的中國國際地位；但至少至目前爲止，我們對此論斷尚難無條件的予以同意：一因中國與德國之間，根本並無敵意的存在；雖德國屢决予中國以可資憤懣的刺激，允如三國盟的爲中國所不能視若無覩，然德國在在阿文件後所作表示，頗夠抵銷中國方面對德所感種種不愉快的大部份。二因亞洲戰事始終具有與歐洲烽火相隔離的餘地，且迄今更有由各方協力先行抑制亞洲方面的侵略而先謀亞洲安定的理由；不但有其理由，且有其可能，祗耍各方作有效的協力；而希臘的戰績，允予這一方面以更好的時間與空間。倘若爾後的事實演進，還像旣往數年間的疎而且迂，則紐約時報所論，殆將終究是對的。</p>
<p>檢討趨勢、確亦是今昔改觀了。蓋如紐約時報所採取的同樣論據，我們所得結論不是二戰合流。而是（一）亞洲方面國際分野的更明顯，（二）對日行使壓力之速度的加速，密度的加密，以及强度的加强，（三）勝負之數已完成了確定的輪廓。例如美國方面由總統羅斯福氏親自宣布援華貸款確定的五千萬美金又未確定辦法的五千萬美金，不出旬日，不但美國立即繼之以艦隊的集結夏威夷，金　輸出的另訂新限制，且英國方面亦即宣布援華貸款一千萬鎊於細則尚未訂定之前。若此萬鈞之力，有如迅雷疾雨。接踵而作，這以英美並行台作而論，以力援中國而論，以對侵略發揮其無情的不妥協態度而論，其速，其密，其强，至少可謂十年以來未之有也。其間更見特殊，確爲向例所絕無的，乃爲英美貸款不待詳定全部辦法而儘先公表其旣確立；這種氣象，決非國際往來中應視爲枝葉的小關節；却是英美對中國，對亞洲，意態奮發而行動迫切的徵候，祇要以此比較旣往數年間人人所感覺的疎而且迂，便可體會這决奮發與迫切的含義了。因此之故，我們不必將歐亞二戰混爲一觀，僅在亞洲戰爭範疇之內，英美兩國之絕不顧忌任何反應而站在中國方面，此其要點，並非謂美國國策的堅定，因此得到又一證明，亦不必更謂英國自此不復徬徨於對日衝突與妥協的岐途，而是顯示了亞洲戰爭中之戰綫的絕無搖撼更張的餘地，亦即剪除了日本方面歷年錯覺爲國際猶有其播弄的餘地。就此趨勢，以與日方四個月前的三國同盟，前日松岡談話之類的外交攻勢，及其在中國的政治攻勢與軍事攻勢，互相對比，可見日本的全盤失敗，確是祇殘餘了兩個疑問：一是日本將擇於何日，以語言行動，承認其失敗？一是日本承認失敗之前，是否擲其孤注於太平洋與印度洋之間？此外，更無嘗試餘地，且終無疑問餘地。而如昨日東京朝日新聞所論：「顯見英美已商定聯合對日施加壓力之計劃，此僅其計劃之一部份」云云，可見日人亦旣自覺其爾後所將遭遇是什麼。</p>
<p>於此有爲中國朝野所應體認的：在日本確定其失敗之前的最後一霎那，極可能的自軍事方面對於中國肆其最後的摧殘與破壞，如在太湖西南的所謂秋季攻勢，在襄河兩岸的所謂冬季攻勢，雖因中國予以逆襲的打擊而日方相繼大敗，然在各戰區抵抗其以摧殘破壞爲目的的突擊，以及加速其全盤崩潰的反攻，皆待中國軍民繼續準備比較旣往四十餘月更慘痛的犧牲。最近英美對華貸款的用途，皆關連中國金融，這是有效且有價値的援助；如此援助而外匯依然穩定，正是中國與英美之間防杜中國資力外溢的絕好手法；然而大局旣有仆劇變形態之中，形成急轉直下的可能，則商民最應慎防經濟方面受此震動而感受劇變；是惟有破除對於貨物價値的迷信，堅定對於法幣價値的信心，然後可以減少劇變的程度，避免劇變中不必要的損失。</p>

<p>歐戰痛史（五）</p>
<h3>英法倉卒應戰真相</h3>
<p>龐納說，「一九三九年八月杪，卽在開戰前幾天，我請陸空兩軍司令到我官邸一叙。我吿訴他們說。。戰爭已日益接近，若非波蘭屈伏，短時間內，戰爭就無可避免。你們身爲軍事當局，假使說我們並無取勝的多大把握，我卽將勸吿波蘭，把但澤和走廊地帶割讓德國了事。我也深知道種辦法過於危險，民衆會駡我出賣捷克不足，又要出賣波蘭。但這並不相干，我但求國家不亡，還有什麽顧慮，又况法國一亡，難道波蘭還能偏安？你們不要誤會，以爲我對於德國作戰的決心，表示懷疑。德國備戰不遺餘力，已有七年之久了，不能僅以虛聲恫嚇，卽可稱覇歐陸，遂其心願，遲早總要一戰的。但是稽遲歐戰的爆發，或者於我們不無裨補。我們若能多得一年半載的時機，整軍經武，於我們也未嘗沒有益處。這就是我召詢諸位將領的意見。我還要問：在軍　上也有不得小要求波蘭忍痛犧牲的重大理　嗎？他們雖個別回答，却是不的而同的說：我們在軍事上看不出有何理由，必須使戰爭遲緩爆發。遷延時日，於我們雖然有利，但於德國也是同樣的有利呀。他們這麼一說，我便無話可講了。」</p>
<p>雖然如此，他還作過最後的努力。八月三十一日下午一點鐘，法國駐義大使龐賽打電話給龐納說：義大利外相齊亞諾現擬召集會議，以解決波蘭問題和其他懸案。龐納相信齊亞諾此舉確是出於誠意。義大利本未預備戰爭，雖與德國訂立同盟，但參戰前尙有三年的猶豫時間。况且義大利輿論亦一致痛惡戰爭。齊亞諾與德國外交部長李本特洛甫最後一决會談，據說並不融洽。義大利祇須在會議中一言，渴望已久的大部利益，卽可唾手而得，殊不必以戰爭出之。這種會議，於英於法，兩有裨益，於義大利亦何獨不然。龐納決心盡力贊助這一計劃。據他後來吿訴我，他因此逕訪　拉第，告以此事，且說，「今夜六點鐘恰好舉行內閣會議，我將力勸各閣員接受，並望總座從旁贊助。這樣，我們就可以既成事實陳諸德國之前了。」</p>
<p>達拉弟富時也答應了。但是龐納把那位總理的脾氣摸錯了。那天晚間閣議席上，達拉第非特不贊助他，而且還攻擊他呢。義大利的建議雖未被斷然拒絕，但是內閣祇願觀望風色，坐待德波直接談判。因此當夜九點鐘內閣公報祇有寥寥數語，說是「內閣一致擁護法國所接受的的束。」九月一日黎明，德軍便浩浩蕩蕩長驅開入波蘭了。</p>
<p>第二日下午兩時十五分，龐納在外交部中聽得電話鈴響，拿起聽筒，不免吃了一驚。電話中沒有一句寒喧之語，忽忽地說：「在下是齊亞諾。龐賽先生（法國駐義大使）和羅蘭爵士（英國駐義大使）都在這裏。我相信召集會議一節，還大有可能……」</p>
<p>龐納當時允許齊亞諾，法國在决日星期日午前，決不向德國提出哀的美敦書。這一段難奇的經過，我相　直到現在還沒有人揭穿過。法國確遵守龐納的允許，遲至星期日的中午纔向德國發出哀的美敦書，又遲至下午五點鐘纔對德宣戰，這種事實却是世人都知道的。英國則係在九月三日上午十一點鐘卽已對德宣戰。相差六小時，其中內幕有如下述：</p>
<p>一九三九年英國輿論已一反慕尼克會議時的熊度，對於再度屈伏，莫不痛心疾首。國會議員乘着休假期間和他們的選民談論，見到全國人民已具有非常決心，大爲所動，英國民衆都信戰事已無可避免，不如愈早愈佳。議員們爲這種民意所激動，決心不再讓張伯倫重蹈去夏覆轍，再向希特勒低首下心了。因此，九月三日早晨九點鐘，英國外相哈立法克斯勳爵打電話給龐納說：</p>
<p>「貴國不能在午前發出哀的美敦書，我知道你自有苦衷，但是敝國未曾向齊亞諾有何允諾，不得小把哀的華教書在今晨送出。敝國下議院將在中午開會，首相出席時設尙未履行對波信的，議院必將鼎沸，他或者因此要下臺了……」</p>
<p>英法兩國雖屬同盟，但宣戰的時刻，却先後相差六小時，其曲折如此。一九三九年九月三日，大戰終於爆發了。這决戰爭，英法事先都一無準備，德國却處心積慮已久，並且運用巧妙手腕，使英法先行宣戰，以免負戎首之責。</p>
<p>撫今思昔，我們可以說，至少法國在戰事初起之時，就已失敗了。</p>
<p>法國的戰敗，是因爲飛機不足，戰車不足，高射砲不足，更因爲工廠不足，不　彌補缺點。法國戰敗，也因爲同盟國陸軍人數過少，更無法把人力物力的巨大儲藏，　速使用。</p>
<p>篇首所記，邱吉爾曾在談話中間用着一種使我驚詫的語氣。我問他爲什麼在制裁　大利時，英國也遽爾退讓，一任義國得逞呢？</p>
<p>他反問道，「你曾注意過龍蝦的本性嗎？」我答說，「我從未把龍蝦的本性當作一件事。」</p>
<p>他說「唔！假使你有機會，不妨研究研究。牠們是很多趣的。龍蝦一生，有好幾次要蛻去牠保護的甲殼。在這脫胎換骨的時期，這個最勇敢的甲殼動物，祇能蟄伏在石縫裏邊，耐心等待。一到新甲長成，牠卽自石縫突出，重顯威風，縱橫海上了。……英國因歷任內閣的輕率畏葸，已把保護　失去，我們不得不暫時潛伏石縫，靜待新甲的成長堅强。」</p>
<p>惜乎英法爲情勢所逼，終於不得不自石縫突出，護甲未成，卽與勁敵相見疆塲之上，這也是兩國的大不幸呀！（完）英國前任駐德大使漢德森實行軍訓</p>

<p>晨初市　無絲毫變動、計銀號對做二十兩、五千七百七十三元、與上日收市價無異、開後證券幫塞予銀號十兩、撳低五元、爲五千七百六十八元、但不久小錢莊暨銀號幫買興尙有、撈進少許、價遂回昂、計銀號對做三十兩、五千七百七十五元、嗣聞匯票帶鬆、加之證券幫某戶力售、維持乏人、猛落二十三十元、計證券幫出銀號二十兩、爲五千七百四十二元、後銀號稍拉、回升十餘元、計銀號入錢兌業二十兩、吿五千七百五十四元、以後市面轉靜、迄午牧價格穩定、計銀號入證券幫十兩、五千七百五十三元、午後情况更形不支、初開證券幫沽予銀號二十兩、爲五千七百五十元、嗣因外匯仍吿微長、人心又極疲萎、散戶等賣出價愈猛落、計銀號對做二十兩、爲五千七百三十五元、後錢兌業獨進、始見上升、計錢兌業　銀號二十兩、五千七百五十二元、但續入銀號二十兩、祇五千七百四十五元、至晚收重稍漲起十餘元、計銀號對做二十兩、五千七百五十四元、比上日軋跌十九兀、全日叫十元上落、現金號之本牌金售價、較烚赤高十數元、牧進低三十元、現標金照掛牌金低五六十元、均鮮做開、</p>
<p>首飾金始終不動</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金、每兩兌出價、大同行仍懸五百九十元、新同行與上價相仿、收進低三十元光景、</p>
<h3>英印銀價俱小</h3>
<p>十一日倫敦電大條銀市，近遠期均跌一八七五、投機家售出、少買戶、市况平、收市後仍穩、叉美銀價現貨仍平、印銀現貨均小五至四安那、市勢穩定、</p>
<h3>貼現無變化</h3>
<p>咋匯　票　貼現率仍平、每千元貼進爲一元、貼出一元半、與七日相同、錢業公會拆息未更、早午兩市均掛七分、</p>
<h3>外幣市況不支</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市况、烚赤市價、因受謠言影響、終落二十元光景、英美金鎊隨降一元、英金票仍鮮變動、美金票步退至十六元六角半、比上日終落五分、香港票佻給稍殷、市價軟弱、日金票及朝鮮愈漲愈勁、前者高至—元五角八分半、後者升爲一元三角二分、</p>
<h3>證券　滬商向倫敦進　中國外債</h3>
<p>倫敦　一日（週三）電、商日中國外債及遠　英今各公司股票掛牌行市、中國公債因上海方面買　頗濃、漲風甚堅前檔之英德續借款（英發（　漲二鎊、價爲四十四鎊、克利斯浦漲一鎊半、價爲二　六鎊半、中法美金及善後借款（英發）各升一鎊、中法爲四十二鎊至四十七鎊、善後爲三十四鎊、後檔鐵路債券京滬漲一鎊、爲十六鎊、道淸漲半鎊、價爲十六鎊半、遠東英商股票祇匯豐銀英倫註册股冉漲十七先令六便士，價爲七十七鎊十七先令六便士、香港註册股不動、其餘亦無榮辱、</p>
<p>證券暗盤、昨日市况依然牛疲無神、祇在五分一角間盤旋不已、獨九六猛漲七角、但買　者祇德孚一家不足爲統一各債之領導、消息沉悶、人心恍惚、暫時似不致有何變動、昨日上午、聯和聯益及信孚現貨流出不少、同康順昌中一及四號稍有買進、午收略疲一二角、午後德孚忽有二十萬九六需要、比上午大漲一元外、長康順昌買進丙戊種、大通收買亦不少、但裕興叉有現貨交出、永豐怡泰亦有斬結、市價又微升五分一角、似此一再盤旋、多方吃息負擔較重、恐將把持不定矣、市價結果、除丁種略好一角外、餘均微小一角左右、獨九六漲起七角、成交總數共計一百四五十萬元茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交通易信託公司三百五十股、價爲二元七角、又成交寗紹輪船公司股一百股、價爲十二元七角牛、</p>
<p>證券買賣、下週一有移至中某信託公司樓上開始買賣之說又衆業公所股市黯澹、絕少生氣、成交之微、爲近　若干時日中所罕見、</p>
<h3>匯通經理之橡股　——續派末决股息——</h3>
<p>英商滙通洋行經理之撤瑪格格橡樹有限公司截至一九四〇年九月底一年之盈餘升達國幣五十六萬餘元、除已派中期股息每股國幣一角五分外、擬續派末次股息每股二角、全年共派三角五分、第三十决股東年會定於本月二十七日舉行、</p>
<h3>紗花　粗細紗俱有需要　雙馬欲跌乏力</h3>
<p>紗市　疲、形式略軟、此因獲利多頭繼續了結、及空頭活動、復來壓迫、因此回挫一步、但同業大戶及外客等吸收之額、按然勿動、所以下降趨勢、殊形迂緩、惟現紗銷路較爲起色、三二支單紗價依然上升、沉默已久之天津帮、十支粗紗採辦漸顯活絡之象也、今日有棉紗二件運新加坡、十件運小呂宋、一百二十件運香港、、</p>
<p>雙馬晨開、因上日午後人氣和平、惟散戶空頭異常活躍、首盤價爲一千二百八十二元、此盤一見、賣者紛至沓來、少頃微跌至一千二百七十七元、但某某等因現銷良好、　二支單紗價格依然前進、而乏現貨供給、所以仍屬傾向購進、某紗亦升十餘元、於是買風突起、檯面忽緊、市盤乃驟形上升、直漲至一千二百八十七元、此價新買者暫行觀望、空方鑒於氣勢稍定、賣　突起、情况受其威脅而下、同時浮戶視局面鬆懈，粉紛了結、因之逐步下落至一千二百七十二元牧盤、査半日問成交統計四千九百四十包、行情二十支雙馬跌十元、茲將各帮口買去之額量、分列如左，</p>
<p>紗市午後轉佳、二十支發馬做到一千二百八十元、比上午突漲十元，且賣者心意澹泊也、</p>
<h3>棉花廠辦　蠕蠕欲動</h3>
<p>現棉情况、已顯起色狀態、申新二九廠因賣出棉紗後、對於原料開始抵償買進、皆屬三十二支及二十支原料爲多數，其他廠家亦有發動模樣、巴西棉價二百八十五元、彭家浦二百五十八元、白洛去二百三十五元、細絨二百五十九元、棉市前途有升無沉也、</p>
<p>另訊外棉市况、紐約棉市靜寂、先因現貨商之賣出而跌、後父因一部份多頭了結、結果收盤價格、較之上日跌五六磅音不等、印度昨日連同預測降一羅比、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、日來又因紗價稍靜、棉市叉轉呆滯、廠方雖懷購意、而未見採購、同業心思則仍高昂異常也、</p>
<h3>疋頭　棉布由平轉堅</h3>
<p>廠布　昨市平穩、午後轉堅、本街心思現期貨躉批成交較多零星實需稍淸、客路粵港烟津等帮實需仍佳、售盤大部未更、廠盤照市昂二角半五角不等、本街成交各布現期貨八百餘件、粤港帮辦府綢花布色布等　百餘件、溫甬台帮辦粗布漂染布二百餘件、北路烟津帮辦粗布府綢藍布等二百餘件、國外新加坡小呂宋等地辦漂布色卡其漂斜等四千餘疋、</p>
<p>東布　先漲後跌、繼又上升、蓋以木街實銷續旺、同業心思看高、遂盤拉進、成交殊夥、故細布細斜中檔各牌回漲每疋三五角、龍頭細布收盤卅六元六角、亦漲二角半、惟嗶嘰走勢較呆、跌二厘半至五厘、四君子收盤爲一元一角〇三七五、</p>
<p>出口　棉布、今日有叫百三十五件、運往香港、又有十四件、運往小呂朱、又有五十四件、運往新加坡、</p>
<h3>羽紗緞又漲二角　—受染價影響—</h3>
<p>電光緞及絲光羽紗、較之上週每碼又激漲二角、因存貨大半已吿罄、新貨除成本略貴外、受染坊上决罷工後、染費在增、杳羽紗緞染費初講疋頭、每疋不論長短一律爲六元算、今則限制訂定三十碼、三十碼之外、論碼計算、每碼法幣一角、於是成本扯價突昂、而其進出較大者爲綢緞綈葛等、綢緞號帮對　新價置之不理、暫抱先售存貨、有消極抵制之態、查染坊家除虹口帮外、一律非新價不接染、隨造成互相擯持二硬對立之勢、而造成其欲需銷者、不得不心急自抬行情、因之新近虹口一帶染坊牛意大見興隆、羽紗絲羽與電光緞行市價又驟漲二角、</p>
<h3>糖市　糖價續向上進</h3>
<p>昨糖市　勢以人心頗佳、故繼續上展、公會劃盤、二四粗白現貨外棧七十四元五角至七十四元八角、比前日（十一日）成交盤子升一元一角、太古車白亦隨升數角、B嘜七十三元五角至八角、十二月底打單七十三元至一角、升三角、DY嘜西棧七十元、HY嘜西棧六十九元七角至七十元、均升五角、荷赤現貨五十七元四角、本棧五十七元至二角、十二月底打單五十七元六角、升五角、昨由香港運來糖一千九百五十包、</p>
<h3>南北貨　金菜升起五元</h3>
<p>金針菜近以到貨較稀、市存亦屬小厚、故趨勢突見緊秀、高貨開升四五元、產價亦升二三元、行盤因之隨升、後市尙防再緊、</p>
<h3>絲茶　絲市預測沉寂</h3>
<p>邇來國內外絲市、頗呈呆滯、橫濱現貨自上月中旬降至一三五〇元後、迄今近月未有上落、紐約現貨自上兩星期下跌後、至今亦維持原狀、可見現貨走銷、實屬停滯、投機交易、亦因之减少、預測絲市前途、或將有一時期之沉寂、故本埠絲市、似難暢展、</p>
<h3>雜項　甘薯亦吃不起</h3>
<p>甘薯目米貴而去路大旺特肚、售價，亦跟米價而趨漲、一月前甘薯尙爲每百市斤五元五角、未幾卽漲爲七兀五角、今則已漲爲九元五角、至於菜塲零售價格、已由每市斤一角漲至一角六分、故赤貧之家、速甘薯亦吃不起矣、</p>
<p>冬笋市况、因蕭紹。甬。來源中斷、　僅有最少數杭笋運到、故　價奇昂、一度曾高至每擔三百四五十元、後因到貨漸湧、稍降至二百五十至二百元內外、最近牛月以來、蕭笋已能繞道運到、且繼續不　、因此市價逐步降至每擔七八十元至一百二十元之間、惟因成本過昂、價已站至平穩水準、卽使以後到貨更湧、亦不致降、而較之去年同期市價、則仍漲上　倍有餘、此外罐四冬笋寗波到貨仍不繼價已飛漲至每箱（四打裝）七十元算尙不易購到云、雁</p>
<h3>五金　鋼骨水泥居奇　美會司鐵交易稀</h3>
<p>水泥　　邇來水泥鋼骨頗屬良好、　申市所存甚薄、而海外又無來貨、故業此者心思挺昂、殊懷居奇之念、因此逐日開價、步見上漲、然客帮交易依然岑寂、僅本街　築帮等程有點綴、査昨市喊價細貨每噸一千二百元、粗花色則須一千一百五十元、</p>
<p>美會司鐵　會司鐵銷路、本街製罐廠當推首席、此外印刷廠玩具廠香烟廠餅亁廠等亦緊隨於後、惟外埠客商以運輸困難、交易大减、查昨成交僅祇白餘箱光景、行情因實銷不暢、亦未見高昂、如老鋼廠售一百七十元新鋼廠售一百六十元左有</p>
<h3>經濟叢談　旱煙（三）</h3>
<p>— 馮柳堂</p>
<p>英人喜吸板烟，據傳前首相鮑爾溫其最著也。但聞板烟之來，由於某科學家用一木，挖一孔以容烟，常在實騐室內試燃吸之，秘不欲人知。某日，吸烟之時，待役闖入，見滿室烟霧，誤以爲失火也，忽忙報警，而其秘密始揭穿，漸爲人知，乃以木製成烟斗，此卽板烟之濫觴也。板烟與中國潮烟，雖烟管有修短之殊、情粗之別，而其使用方式如一轍也。吸烟何以會流行，正爲其能辟穢，能運化，能提神，且携帶便利，往往飯後一烟在手，習爲故常。然亦有其害，蓋烟中含有尼古Nicotine，毒物也。前人謂烟油能殺蛇蟲，正爲烟油中有尼古，存在。尼古了亦有稱之爲菸鹼，在良的烟葉中，的含百分之二，劣者則含百分之八。本來爲無色油狀液體，觸着空氣則呈褐色，如其純粹的尼古丁數滴，可以傷人性命。所以多年老烟袋的烟油，灌入蛇口中，居然能殺蛇。又惟其尼古丁富於刺戟，且有不快之臭味，故易傷腦。用火燃烟，故火氣直衝，每　喉，口腔多病，喉啞聲嘶，均爲此故。</p>
<p>旱烟，各地皆有出品，惟以杭州元奇烟爲最。烟絲金黃可愛，香味允充足，或謂攙有蘭花子粉，卽澤蘭子），亦謂雜有檀香末，惟性太燥，將吸之前，須稍潤澤，則味較和，然過濕又不便於吸。　（完）</p>

<h3>警員被毆辱案　工部局昨提交涉　人力車照事件亦將抗議　滬西襲車案各方頗重視</h3>
<p>據工部局情報處昨（十二日）晨公吿、「關於本月八日晚、警務處警員在滬西界外馬路區域遭日本憲兵解除武器、毆擊及扣留案、業由本局總董致函日本總領事提起交涉矣、」此爲工部局於該區被封鎖後就各項發展情形提出交涉之第二次、按第一决係十二日所提出者、爲關於日商公共汽車未得工部局同意、擅自在滬西行駛、致特許交通營業權破侵害一事、一般相信、關於「市府」方面迫令公共租界人力車夫捐領「市照」一事、或將引起工部局第三决之交涉、據日本大使館發言人稱、工部局二决所提之抗議均已收到、現在硏究中、目下尙不能有所發表、</p>
<p>抗議內容　尙稱和緩</p>
<p>平明社記者探悉、工部局於昨日上午十時、由該局總董凱自威名議、以書面抗議送交日本總領事、對於本月八日下午九時、發生工部局警務處人員被日憲兵扣押一事、提出抗議、該抗議書內容、工部局未予發表、惟據可恃外人方面所得消息、工部局根據警務處長包文少校之正式報吿、向日方提出交涉，聞抗議書措詞、至爲和緩、對於日憲兵行爲實不合法理、表示遺憾、但未向日方提出要求道歉等語氣、</p>
<p>日商汽車依然營業</p>
<p>日商公共汽車昨晨（十二）賡續行駛愚園路上、工部局因日方此舉、侵害英商公共汽車與電車公司在西區行車之特權、已向日黨局提起抗議、今在等候覆文中、</p>
<p>西報所載　襲車真相</p>
<p>字林報云、滬西公共租界越界築路區昨（十一日）夜突叉發生紛擾、事緣午後八時十五分許、英商中國公共汽車公司之七路公共汽車一輛、循憶定盤路而行、抵海格路附近、路旁突竄出暴徒的三十人、其目的不在行刦、惟拋磚石猛擲該公共汽車、並以鐵尺木棍搗毀車窗玻璃、司機人亦遭惡待、致受微傷、但乘客無　傷者、迨警員聞訊趕到、暴徒已作鳥獸散、消息靈通人士頗重視此事、蓋愚園路與大西路已被封鎖、而英商公共汽車行駛西區者、僅剩七路一綫、且公共租界當局已提抗議、反對日方公共汽車行駛西區也、負責人士對於昨夜之暴舉、有無政治動機一問、拒不置評、昨夜英商公共汽車公司交涌科亦拒不透露消息、惟華人方面傳、牽涉於紛擾之公共汽車共兩輛、關於西區最近發展、如日當局在昌平路延平路口、新架障碍物、禁止各車通行等事、工部局昨正靜候警務處正式提出報吿、</p>
<p>車照問題　進行調查</p>
<p>公共租界當局、對於日當局禁止公共租界人力車進入滬西越界築路區一業、昨日正在調査、據工部局發言人對記者稱、關於此事之詳細情形、尙未可知、現正候警務處管理人力車事宜之警官之全部報吿、消息靈通方面、認爲日方與「市府」此舉、顯在强迫滬西一切人力車之登記、查數日夾傭警現滬西區大發傳單、通吿人力車夫捐領「市照」、傳單上雖規定星期一（十六日）爲截止日期、但星期三（十一日）晚已突然實行、以致一般人力車夫猝不及防、無法進入滬西區、</p>
<p>一部地區　解除宵禁</p>
<p>滬四封鎖區自愚園路至大西路一段、原定每晚八時起、實施宵禁但昨日此項宵禁已由日當局悄然予以解除、事前亦無任何通吿、沿億定盤路之鐵絲網障礙物、已於昨日上午撤除、該處站崗之日哨兵稱、此一部份之搜查工作、已吿結束、但其他部份、則仍在繼續搜查、但該哨兵對於所謂其他部份、並未說明何處、當記者行至地豐路時、則見該處已架設新鐵絲網、但並不集中於一處、而係零星散處者、由此可見封銷區之限制、顯已寬弛、而封鎖之範圍、亦已大見縮小矣、</p>
<h3>米業展長交貨期限　宣佈絕對無效　拖長出貨限期居心叵測　昨經何德奎氏面加責問</h3>
<p>査本月九日下午、本埠兩租界當局、曾召集上海市豆米行業暨雜糧油餅業兩同業公會代表多人、在工部局開會、討論權定米市辦法、當經一致決定、自本月十二日起、凡在米市塲購米者、一律當天先付定洋每包五元、並限定五天以內付款出貨、業經公布在案、上項辦法、在乎防杜投機、安定米市、</p>
<p>藐視決議　協助投機</p>
<p>乃昨日報載、以上兩公會於十一日下午舉行執監聯席會議、結果議決關於在米市塲成交之米糧交易、其出貨日期、根據本年五月八日兩公會聯席會議議決案、於成交日起、十天內過磅出淸等情、不特違反本月九日工部局會議原議決案、抑且足以助長米市投機惡風、殊屬荒謬、工部局副總辦何德奎氏有鑒於此、認爲非嚴加整飭不足穩定米市、爰於昨日下午、再度召集兩公會代表到局、面加詰責、　令將昨日報載「十天內過磅出淸」之議決案、尅日宣布絕對無效、此後務須遵照本月九日工部局會議通過「限令五天內付款出貨」之議決案、切實辦理、母許取巧規避、倘敢故違、一經査明屬實、定當依法嚴懲、聞兩公會代表、已遵諭照辦矣、</p>
<p>米價又漲　前途可慮</p>
<p>昨日米市仍未能因米業團體之各項緊急措置而趨穩定、因投機份子雖一度匿跡銷聲、但昨又在市塲活躍、致各檔洋米、每石又被抬高元半左右、此種市價之急劇變化、於整個米市前途之演變、仍甚可慮、據米業中某君稱、在戰前米價之在三數日後、始有變動、且變動之價格、小則每石數分、最高亦不過二角左右、卽目下米價、在一小時中、竟有上落數元之鉅者、而經營米糧者、反不以爲異、所以過去米市係爲共給民食需要而設、今則已形成投機市塲矣、</p>
<p>吳屬同鄉　舉辦集購</p>
<p>蘇州旅滬同鄉會、因會員建議、特舉辦集團購米、首批一千包、卽將足額、凡吳屬同鄕（包括蘇州常熟吳江崑山）行號個人、均可向新閘路會所索取申請書、或向收款機關雁豐銀行華帳房及國華銀行接洽訂購手續、</p>
<h3>法租界全體華捕　發表嚴正聲明　要求改善待遇並無作用　華總巡周尙義調入總行</h3>
<p>法租界華捕改善待遇事、前日下午四時、法警務處副總監勃朗希、復召集華捕代表三人、舉行談話、遂一詢問華捕所提各項條件之意義、及怠崗之目的、華捕代表當剴切解釋、並表示怠崗乃迫不得已之手段、絕無其他目的、勃氏表示滿意、並聲明、所提條件、卽轉呈當局、在短期內必可獲圓滿答覆、決不使法租界華捕待遇較低於公共租界、望各安心職守云云、現法租界全體華捕、均服務如常、秩序殊佳、靜候當局之覆示、</p>
<p>當局答覆　在考慮中</p>
<p>據探悉、華捕所提條件、已於昨日由法警務處副總監勃朗希轉呈總監法勃爾、經法氏初步硏究後、當可於今日送呈法總領事、聞法總領事對此或將召集法租界首腦會議、俾詳密研討、通盤籌劃、其答覆大的不日可送交華捕方面、華捕所提條件中、原有華捕總巡設寫字間於中央捕房之要求、現法方對條件雖未答覆、但已於昨日上午發令、現駐於嵩山捕房之華捕總巡周尙羲、調赴中央捕房辦公、俾隨時與華捕保特接觸、</p>
<p>華捕表示　沈明大義</p>
<p>法租界全體華捕爲貫澈改善待遇要求、已於昨日由每一捕房推派代表一名、組織華捕臨時代表委員會、進行一切、昨日該會特向外界發表聲明、謂昨日（十一日）華捕被迫發生怠崗、致使法租界內居民一時感覺不安、深致歉仄華捕此决要求目的、純在改善生活、俾堪負担高物價之壓力、此外絕無其他作用、華捕等均深明大義、決不爲仟何方面利用、陷界內居民於不安、此可吿慰於全體市民者、在當局尙無覆示之前、華捕安心服務、決不擅棄職守、華捕生活必須改善、但以和平手段解決、全體市民、諒能同情、</p>
<p>法方宣佈　即可解決</p>
<p>法租界警務處情報部昨日對於法租界華捕要求增加津貼之消息、加以吾認、星期三（十一日）薛華立路法總巡捕房華捕十五名怠崗的一小時、此事迄今並無新發展、據稱、當時怠崗之華捕、不久卽復崗、事後亦未提出任何要求、情報部警官指出、的於一星期之前、警務處職員已被正式通知稱、法公董局正在考慮改良待等之待遇據消息靈通方面稱、至早今日予以公佈、俾早安華捕心理、</p>
<h3>新藥業將處理　滯越藥品</h3>
<p>上海市新藥業同業公會昨日通吿會員藥房云、逕啟者、據會員報吿、謂據可靠方面傳來消息、我華商滯越貨物、有越南當局行將拍賣之傳說、如果確實、我華人揖失之重大、自不待言、而報紙所載市商會辦理此事、又盡屬子虛、因念我同業中在越被阻之貨、當不在少、不知貴會有吾接獲是項消息、尙希轉函各同業徵詢對此事意見、以便預爲之計、蓋挽救之方、以敝業之見解、最好莫如集合我同業中之各貨主、共同委派專員一二人、前往越南處理此事、以免重大損失、爲特專函布達、祇希察照見復等語釗會、用特備函通吿貴處、對於上開辦法、有何意見、希函到三日內見復爲盼、</p>

<p>澳大利亞第一任駐日公使的翰接登姆爵士、昨日乘大英公司郵船南京輪、於下午三時十分抵滬、下榻於外灘華懋飯店、於下午六時招待新聞界同人、各報記者應邀前往、卽其對於太平洋上有無避免武裝衝突可能之意見、爵士答稱、渠不知太平洋上有何不可避免冲突之理由、</p>
<p>澳日同意　呼喚使節</p>
<p>爵士談稱、目下澳大間、並無懸而未決之重要問題、渠稱、澳洲對於太平洋東岸任何重大之變動、不能漢然置之不問、渠解釋澳日兩國同意交換使節之動機、乃在獲得史迅速而準確之情報、</p>
<p>一向承認　重慶國府</p>
<p>記者又詢以澳洲有無遣派公使至重慶中國政府之可能、爵士答稱、此事或許已在攷慮中、但渠尙無確切之報吿、關於中日戰事之問題、爵士答稱、澳大利亞一如其他除日本以外之國家、一向承認重慶國民政府爲中國唯一合法之政府、</p>
<p>澳以全力　援助英國</p>
<p>爵士父談歐戰問題、據稱、澳大利亞將以百分之百保證援助英國、澳人奪死不願處於希特勒之新秩序下、澳大利亞之軍火製造與農業生產、均能自給、自歐戰發生以來、黃金之出產、亦見增加、實行徵兵後、可得戰士二十五萬人、作爲國防之用、其中八萬人現正予訓練、飛機製造、亦日見增多、</p>

<p>專家建議自動加捐</p>
<p>本市某財務專家聲稱、公共租界當局現遇惡劣之財政危局、其咎非在工部局、而全在納稅人、緣自工部局出售電務處、得銀八千二百萬兩後、數年內納稅人堅持此款先應動用、而不贊成加捐、今此款已悉數用罄、納稅人不得不於來年復增捐稅至少什五、若納稅人立卽准許續加捐稅、則工部局之財務情勢、將大見好轉、納稅人欲有此舉、必須召開臨時大會、自動決定在明年七月一日前增加市政捐、以免工部局復負他債、致日後困難越甚、</p>

<h3>英僑婦女協會　耶誕義賣展幕速寫（下）</h3>
<p>一位穿綠色衣服的女士對我道：「先生，你也試試看麼？」</p>
<p>我正站在懸有「你能使用筷子麽？」的檯子前，看一個小女孩用筷子挾小玻璃球。檯上放着一只鐘，兩只搪瓷碟子，－一只盛有玻璃彈子二十棵，一只是空的－一雙硃紅筷子。化了兩毛錢後，便把碟子裏的玻璃彈一棵棵的挾入空碟子裏，以兩分鐘爲限。那女孩子倒也慣用中國筷子，在兩分鐘中居然挾起了五棵。</p>
<p>輪到我執筷了。我想別的事缺少經騐，用筷子，總算內行呢！可是結果比了那小女孩子只多挾起了兩棵不勝愧汗。我剛要退下時，嘻嘻哈哈，花枝嚴招的來了兩位西洋少女。其中一個拿起筷朝盤子裏就挾，東攬西拌，滑溜溜的玻璃彈子總不肯就範。綠衣女士看着鐘，口中念道：「半分鍊……一分鐘……一分半鐘……」。旁邊那位小姐看得不耐煩起來，索性把五隻靑葱玉指朝盤子一抓，唿啷一聲響，玻瑙彈子棵棵落瓷盤，引得大家笑聲不絕。</p>
<p>前天下午，寇爾爵士夫人曾在無綫電話中廣播道，諸位不僅可在會塲中購到有用的聖誕節禮物，以金錢作有用的濟助，同時也能在會塲中得到無數歡樂。她的話的確不錯，遊戲室中到處聞得笑聲，允其小孩子們，一來之後，就不肯走。</p>
<p>重新回到義賣大會塲，已是三時三十分鐘，英大使夫人正領導着一羣男女小孩，繞着聖誕樹唱歌慶祝。聖誕老人也提早了兩星期，翩然蒞止。在披亞娜繁絃激奏，歌聲琴韻，滿室騰蕩之時，我被擁在人叢中，進既不能，退叉不得。只覺得頷下頰際，兩手所接觸的都是些毛葺葺的皮大衣。突然間覺得手腕中有些冰冷濕膩，連忙回過頭來看，原來一個孩子手裹正拿着一根冰棒，拼命掙扎要想從人堆裏鑽出去。奮鬥了半天，她還是在原陣地，那冰棒却巳濕淋淋的溶去了大半呢。</p>
<p>擠出會塲門，兩個小學生在我面前掠過。其中一個指着對門的小食攤道：「Look！Hot－dog．free！」我心想義賣塲中竟有這等便宜事情，爲什麼攤前冷落無人呢？可是仔細一看，那兩個小學生竟在開玩笑。食攤前明明寫着：「香腸三明治每客一元半一！那時已三時五十分樓上茶窒門前，擠滿許多人等待進去。大槪茶室打烊」之時，卽三明治上市之頃了。心中爲之釋然。</p>
<p>轉過大看台，朝北下樓，人聲漸稀，身上微微覺得有些冷起來了。大看檯上寫着：「贏票在此兌現」，賽馬季中到過大看台的人，總還記得這些撈什子。從窒內走下大理石扶梯，步出馬　路大門，大鐘上正指着四點鐘。　（完）</p>

<h3>蔡同德國藥號　學徒圖害經理　深夜闖入臥室引電加害　經理觸電驚覺掙扎脫險</h3>
<p>科學愈發達、犯罪之方法愈演進、如以前周欽吉周欽祥以電流殺死周永杰案、該兩子之所用方法、卽自硏究無線電所得、乃最近又有同樣事件發生、茲特記其事實於后、緣有寗波人姚爾强、現年二十歲、向在河南路四百五十五號蔡同德藥材店</p>
<p>充當學徒已歷三載、平時品性尙佳、該店所有銀錢、向由經理兼司賬甬人蔡雨祥（年已六十二歲）所掌管、銀箱亦置於蔡之房內、鎖匙亦由蔡藏於貼身之衣袋內、詎姚不知如何、突起不良之念、於十一日上午三時半、姚以圍巾蒙面、越窗而入蔡之臥室、以預置裝有兩面電燈揷頭（俗稱撲落）之</p>
<p>電綫一根乘蔡熟睡之際、以揷頭之一面、揷入儲有電流之撲落內、使電流入該電線、遂後以另一面之揷頭、觸於蔡之頭部、詎蔡受電驚醒、力加掙扎、並一手將姚之頭髮握住、致姚因此亦身受電流、姚知自身亦有危險、亟將另一揷頭拔去、電流遂吿中斷、姚見事敗露、急</p>

<h3>天主敎在中國　五大文化事業概况（六）　（四）震旦博物院</h3>
<p>震旦博物院、原名韓德博物院（Museum　Hendes）、所以紀念創辦人韓德神父也、始建於淸同治七年、（一八六七年）其最初地址在上海徐家匯天文台之北、民國二十三年建新院於法和界呂班路與勞神父路轉角處規模宏大、今上海市博物館業已被燬、獨亞洲文會博物院與震旦博物院猶獲倖存亞洲文會博物院專供民衆鑑賞、較爲通俗、貯藏不及震旦博物院之富、設備亦較簡單、故震旦博物院在目前實已獨步滬濱、震旦博物院自創始者韓神父奠基后、中經柏白松三神父之慘淡經營、迄現在負責之鄭神父P．Piel孜孜兀兀、始終不懈、所歴艱辛、不知凡幾、乃有此可貴之成績？謂爲諸神父之心血結晶不爲過也、</p>
<p>韓德神父爲搜集各項標木、遍遊中國各地、曾作長途旅行七决、凡舊式之交通工具、如螺橋帆船獨輪車等俱曾使用、今博物院中且陳列是項交通工具之模型、並懸有韓神父旅行所至之地圖、頗能啟參觀者好學之心、</p>
<p>各任神父所收集者、大抵皆限於一二類、如雷神父專集鹿類標本達三千六百七十五種、爲遠東最豐富者、白神父寫植物學博士、凡江蘇省之草類標本、大致已收集齊全、現在巴黎大學敎授、松神父則專集昆蟲、亦有獨特貢獻、鄭神父曾硏究某種昆蟲之生殖狀况、發現雌蟲產卵后、雄者卽單獨生活、而雌者依舊牛生不息、經四十四决之硏究及試騐、卒製成是項單性生殖之圖解及標本、精妙絕倫、對於蚌類研究、則諸神父曾爲集體創作、除共同發現七百餘種外、韓神父個人卽單獨　現五百七十二種、而關於「中國自然歴史之著作、亦以韓氏爲最富、</p>
<p>該院共有三樓、每樓各有二大室底層爲古物部、陳列中國歴代玉瓷銅器、上溯商周、無大且備、且多外間不經見之珍品、如康熙二十三年去世之崇開黃安國、其葬時衣冠、迄今完整如新、亦爲該院所得、並特製木人以服其衣、陳列展覽、至爲奇特、</p>
<p>樓爲動物標本室、分哺乳類、鳥類兩樓類、魚類·軟體動物類等三樓爲昆蟲類及植物類、計二三樓有鳥類標本三千四百三十五件、動物標本六千三百七十五件、植物標本五萬一千六百件、昆蟲類標本二十萬件、蚌類標本一千三白件、其他標本二十萬件、龜類及動物骨骼各二三千件、因尙無專人負責、故至今未加整理、此外叉有研究試騐與圖書等室、設備俱極完善、</p>
<p>按該院戰前常有送贈獵得動物者、戰後已無新品、去年院方雖曾派人赴察哈爾、終爲戰事所迫而退回、所幸已得各物、均獲安全運滬、據該院硏討結果、世界已認識之蟲類的爲一萬萬種以上、而未經人定名者、亦必有一萬萬種、該院發現之新動物、多送各國檢定、柏林·維也納·爪哇·巴黎·舊金山等處、均與該院取得聯絡、前年該院發現世界新蟲類三十三種、中國新種類二十二種、惟該院門研究爲膜翅蟲類及爬翅蟲類、故世界有關於此蟲類之新發現品、亦送該院檢定、以爲學識上之交換、計前年共檢定三種、該院現並製有原蟲色彩之範型圖一百九十五幅云、</p>

<h3>喬治夫婦</h3>
<p>— 水冗</p>
<p>『喬治，密斯張她們都問候你。』</p>
<p>把手皮包往小圓桌上一扔，轉過身子去卸大衣。長方形的着衣鏡裏現出一張尖削的女人臉；高凸的顴骨，微向上翹的嘴脣，驕傲然而帶點憂鬱的眼睛，…</p>
<p>沒有回應。打鏡子裏斜窺過去：黯綠的電燈光照着呆坐在沙發上的喬治，兩手托着黃腮巴，在沉思。向上翹的嘴脣嘟了一下。</p>
<p>陡的蛇一樣的滑過去，坐到沙發的靠手上，吐出銀鈴似的聲音：『Darling，你怎麼了？』</p>
<p>沉默。時鐘湊巧可可地打了八下。淡紅的窗帘上有樹影子在嬉戲。</p>
<p>『沒有什麼。沒有什麼。』深沉的眼直望着窗帘，又似乎在望着它後面什麽遙遠的地方。</p>
<p>『你騙人。我知道的！你是爲了這幾天我回來遲了，是不是？但是眞討厭，那班人！白白給她們讀書，還缺課，還得派人去訪問她們！爲了那個婦女夜校，會裏大天開會。密斯陳，夜校的校長，跑來向我們報吿：「訪問的效果是出乎意料的壞：有幾個來了，大多數却推說沒有空，暫時不能來。有一個索性對到她家裏去訪問員說：「沒有用處，不讀了。」就自管自粘她的錫箔了。」那班死人第一天上課就：「先生！我什麽時候會寫信呢？」「我只要能够上賬就好了！」』</p>
<p>深沉的眼直望着窗帘。又似乎在望着它後面什麼遙遠的地方。</p>
<p>女的又輕輕的碰了他一下『喂，校董先生！再講一樁好笑的事你聽聽：密斯黃她吿訴我，有一决上公民課，她對那班人說：「不要隨地吐痰，鼻涕哼在手帕裏。」馬上就有人站起來問：「先生！沒有手帕怎麼辦呢？」你想，好笑不好笑？……唔，Darling，幾天沒有陪伴你了。眞討厭！我說，她們不來由她們去，她們每人付的一元錢保證金，老實不客氣都給沒收！密斯張她們都同意我的牛張，但是密斯胡不贊成。她說：「問題的關鍵是在乎她們沒有錢，窮！窮小是罪惡，應該同情她們。此　我們只有盡力誘導她們，敎給她們生活環境裹最需要的，也是最易接受的東西。」哈！高調誰不會唱？你去做呀！……唔，够了！等一會，吃了飯，我陪你看電影去。』</p>
<p>門口響起「閣閣」的皮鞋聲。『媽！媽！』</p>
<p>『什麼事？哎呀！滿頭大汗！怎麼弄得那麼骯髒？』</p>
<p>『小少爺要吃飯，我說少奶沒有吩咐，當然不能開。小少爺就——』走在後面的唐媽氣喘喘的說明着。</p>
<p>『當然？』上嘴脣偏了一下。『唐媽，我通知你：你的孩子生病，你可以找一個替工，這樣昏頭昏腦是不對的。你看，你把的翰弄得像個什麼樣子了？你不能怪我—』</p>
<p>突然，「的令令令」—燈檯上的電話鈴響了！</p>
<p>『哈囉！……誰？呵，密斯張！是的！…沒有什麽事！…可以。我馬上來！』把電話機按上。『密斯張要我馬上去打麻將。還有密斯黃，密勘陳，三缺一，不好意思不應酬！』</p>
<p>急急地披上大衣。把手皮包打開，掏出一些什麼來，就對着皮包上的小鏡子，在臉上，眉上，嘴上抹着。一眼看見唐媽還獃在旁邊：『怎麼還不去　飯？』</p>
<p>『我—想向少奶借幾塊　！』</p>
<p>『什麼？你知道我要去打麻將，問我拿錢？』響亮的把手皮包關緊，跑到門口。『冉會，Darling！再會，Sonnie！呵，今晚上又不能陪你去看電影了，眞討厭！』</p>
<p>門「嘭」的給帶上了。</p>
<p>『媽！媽！』　喬治無力地抬起頭。『的翰，到爸爸這裹來。來！』看到約翰沒有動，祇能「父代母職」了……</p>
<p>唐媽搖搖頭，歎了口氣。</p>
<h3>看</h3>
<p>— 散人　苟生作畫</p>
<p>有一個人偶然對天空呆望着，背後的人也挨了上來，於是過路的人也停了脚步，漸漸的一大堆人都望着天空。看什麽？大家不知道。</p>
<p>「吿地狀」，有什麼好看？圍着的人却是一大堆。「做做好事吧」，沒有人化一個子兒。總之，你看，我看，大家看看。</p>
<p>「火燒」自然更好看了，然而却沒有勇氣圍上去；最好火燒得越旺越好，而自己是站得越遠更妙，所謂「隔岸看火」，何等寫意！</p>
<p>這還是光「看」，還有要搨點「便宜」，或者竟是說是金乘火打刦」。舉一個例子吧，有了，大概總沒有忘了英王加冕的盛况吧：巡捕的鞭子落在前排的身上，後面的人就造了「社會新聞」空前的一頁！</p>
<p>你看，我看，大家看看；但沒有看得遠一點的人。</p>

<h3>章臺枊</h3>
<p>— 顾明道</p>
<p>淸彰節　，春回大地，河上綠波淸漣，張天如十分高興，要携枊氏姊妹一同泛舟淸溪，兼遊靜園，訪倪南雲。如是不忍過拂恩師的厚意，遂隨張大如出遊。他們到了靜園，恰値倪南雲到蘇州去了，主人不在，由僕人代為招待。張天如未免掃興，只得在園中四處走走。柳如是却惦念着舟中飲酒的大漢，頻催張天如返舟。張天如遂出資賞了僕人，和柳氏雙妹走回船來，只見石達尙在艙中箕踞而坐，吃得杯盤狼籍。徐大娘湊在柳如是的耳朶邊，低聲說道：「你們自己去遊園，却留一個奇形怪狀的乞丐在船中牛飲，壺燙好，又是一壺，肚皮好似通海的，足有八九斤酒喝去了，菜早吃完，却向我們要花生米下酒，一斤花生又已吃光，還不肯走，你們留他做什麼呢？我從來沒見這般施捨與乞丐的。」如是微微笑，叫了一聲母親，搖搖手說道：「他這個乞丐與衆不同，母親不要咕噥，我們自會打發他走。」如是說罷，和張天如絳子等走進中艙。石達見他們回來，放下酒杯，向他們拱拱手道：「你們回來了嗎？多謝你們請俺喝酒。俺老實不客氣已喝得不少，不敢再行打擾。你們的盛情，俺心感不忘，異日如有機緣，也當報答俺本是河北人氏，流浪江湖，已歷十載，風塵碌碌，知己難逢，人家都把乞丐看待俺。俺想現在一般王公大人，寡廉鮮恥，也是無非在那裏乞取富貴，倒不如老老實實的行乞吧。俺的身世雖欲奉吿，也無從說起。少年時也曾與盜跖爲伍，只是早已懺悔，放下屠刀，所以弄得囊空如洗了。諒你們不致見笑的吧。」說罷，把壺中剩酒湊在嘴上，嘓嘟嘟的喝　罄凈。咂着舌道：「好酒好酒，長久沒有喝到這種好酒了。」張天如和柳如是方要說話，石達已霍地放下酒壺，將手背在自己嘴上抹抹，說聲打攪，又把　手向他們拱拱，大踏步走出艙外，輕輕一跳，已至岸上，酒開大步，飛也似的望東邊跑去，一眨眼間已不見了他魁梧的背影。柳如是目送他去，不覺咨嗟道：「古有黃衫虬髯之徒，此人卽是流亞了，令人可念。」張天如也說道：「好一個草莽英雄！惜乎不得其　呢」這時日影已西，水波映着陽光作金黃色，晚風拂袂，尙覺春寒，一行人遂在夕陽影裏彭掉回歸家院去。（八）</p>

<h3>四小名旦翹楚　李世芳將重現色相</h3>
<p>— 之文</p>
<p>張君秋決放棄組班　萬里認子眞假莫辨</p>
<p>（北平通信）故都四小名旦除了李世芳外，其餘如張君秋·宋德珠·毛　來·都是露了相當的頭角。世芳在「七七」事變前，原是童伶中最活躍的人物；他自從被立言報選爲實伶自席後，更是聲價十倍。那時張君秋隨同雷喜福露演，尙默默無聞：宋德珠在戲校祇演武旦戲，花旦戲雖也偶然公演，但技藝平庸；毛世來演花旦及刀馬戲雖頗可觀，但比起李世芳的地位尙遜一籌。像富社的獨有本戲「酒丐」「金瓶女」等，世芳都是担任主角，而世來却居於配角的地位。當世芳正蒸蒸日上的時候，嗓子不幸起了變化，竟歌不成聲，這均於他當然是一個很大的打擊。最近三年來，對於嗓子的治療和調養，委實費了極大的精力。他會往協和醫院，也曾到名醫那裏診治；同時每日不間斷練習武工。這無非楚企圖在舞台重規身手在而已。目下張宋毛三人已南北知名，而世芳反漸漸被人遺忘，他每想到這兒，更是拚命的鍜鍊技藝，希望將來能與他們三人爭一日之短長。</p>
<p>蒼天不負苦心人，世芳總算沒有白費功夫，嗓子居然喊出來了。他的父親和朋友是多麼高興。在各方面催促下，世芳經兩月之籌備，終於組織了班。不過關於角色，爲了充實陣容，一再更動。老生原定貫成習，現在換了陳少霖；武生楊盛春代替了高盛麟，花臉仍是老搭擋袁世海；他倆在富社時，每决貼演「覇王別姬」，無不賣滿堂。世芳之虞姬，世海之覇王，堪稱棋逢敵手，唱作精采倍出。世海出科後，覇王改由葉盛茂扮演，就减色了不少。至於小生，則由姜妙香担任。世芳所演各劇，除「金瓶女」「崑崙劍俠傳」等外，均宗畹華；妙香爲畹華之硬配，此决世芳邀請他參加，可以隨時請敎，受益自然不少。丑角爲孫盛武及艾世菊，也都是後起之秀。總管事原定爲袁世海，他現在勾留上海，不知什麽時候才能回來，所以世芳暫請天津中國戲院的角人李華亭兼任。該班定名爲「承芳社」，世芳自任社長。關於出演的日期，已定爲明年元旦。現在各戲院爭相邀請中。</p>
<p>張君秋自結婚後，因鑒於李世芳組班，自己也頗有獨挑大楔之意。可是他想到宋德珠說「我組班受够了氣」的話，又不免有些氣餒。組班幷不是件容易事，的角固然困難，但應付各種麻煩的事務，允其令人頭痛。况且馬連良對於他很好，父不好意思脫離。天津以君秋組班的聲浪日高，大觀園戲院會派人來平邀請露演，被他婉謝了。據他的表示：現在已放棄組班之意，今後仍搭　連良的「扶風社」。因為自己組班幷不能一定能够有把握賺錢。</p>
<p>此外還有一件轟動平津劇壇的事，就是「張君秋不認生父」。君秋在結婚的前後，有一老者自上海到故都來，自認爲君秋生父。據說君秋的父親在他很小的時候，便看破紅塵，遁入深山（在浙江）。現在以君秋在劇壇享受大名，同時又因思兒心切，便由滬到平，請求收養。君秋以爲這老者突如其來，幷無佐證，結果願出四百元，了解這一椿糾紛，可是他的父親不肯答應。另一說，他的父親在直魯軍閥時代，担任某處處長，後因事被捕。迨北伐軍至津，才被釋放；卽至返家，却已鵲巢鳩占，他懷着憤怒的心情遠赴春申。至於這兩種傳說，是不是事實，局外人却無法證明。不過我們却盼望這一塲糾葛能够得到合理而公正的解決。（十一月八日寄）</p>
<h3>白楊顧而已等舞臺活躍　在渝上演宋之的新作「刑」</h3>
<p>（陪都航訊）中電劇團的成立，是在一年之前，「戰鬥」一劇便是他的處女作，接着先後協助各劇團的簡接工作，以及發動過多少决的鄕下演劇運動，去年冬，隨着「中電」「長空萬里」外景隊赴滇採攝外景之餘暇，在昆明上演了「羣魔亂舞」「塞上風雲」諸劇，今春返渝後，一方面爲了「中電」本身的各種紀錄影片以及「長空萬里」的內景工作，亟待完成，另一方面爲了疊遭轟炸，使他們失去了演劇塲所，因之半年餘來頗見沉寂。</p>
<p>最近，他們爲了展開冬季劇運，同時，也爲了響應中央黨部的寡捐義舉，在第一次籌備會議的討論結果，選定了宋之的之「刑」，章泯之「夜」，及葛一虹之紅纓槍」三劇，在短期內分別演出，而以「刑」作首决公演。「刑」的中心取材，是針對着目前最嚴重的米糧問題與兵役問題，由章泯導演，演出委員會人選與演員分配均已定當，塲所亦決假座「國泰」，日期準於十二月二十日起。</p>
<p>至於「夜」紅纓槍諸劇，亦已決定由沈西苓，孫師毅分任導演，也在籌備計劃中。</p>
<p>「刑」的演出委員會共有委員十三人，爲羅學濂，白楊，沈西苓，余仲英，徐蘇靈，徐昂千，施超，高占非，孫瑜，裘逸葦，潘孑農，魏鶴齡，顧而已等。</p>
<p>重要演員是施超（施景雲），溫容（李不楞），白楊（顧玉錦）沙蒙（衛大成），白雲（老太婆），顧而已（顧榮軒）等</p>

<h3>Anglo-American Agreement on Plans for Jointly Imposing Severe Blow on Japan; Rumor of Japanese Troops Assembling to Threaten Singapore; Sino-British Authorities to Negotiate Loan Details</h3>
<p>Chongqing – According to reliable sources here, Mr. Song Ziwen will soon travel from the United States to London to negotiate the details of a new loan to China with British authorities. Meanwhile, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, the British Ambassador to China, is expected to remain in Chongqing during the negotiations. According to Reuters, the newly appointed British Embassy Military Attaché will arrive in Chongqing soon from London, but his name has not yet been announced. It is said that this person is quite familiar with Far Eastern affairs and has worked in the Far Eastern Division of the War Office. Chinese here attach great importance to the United States placing iron and steel manufactures under export license control, which is said to deal a severe blow to Japan. (Reuters dispatch of the 12th)</p>
<p>Tokyo – Asahi Shimbun reported in today’s editorial that the British loan of one million pounds to the Chongqing government and the American announcement of expanded restrictions on steel exports to Japan occurred simultaneously, indicating that Britain and the United States have agreed on a plan to jointly pressure Japan. This is only part of a larger plan. Previously, Britain prioritized the European war and hesitated between compromise and conflict with Japan. Now, Britain has followed the leadership of the United States and is providing financial assistance to Chongqing. The expression of hostility by Britain and the United States towards Japan will only strengthen General Chiang Kai-shek's resistance, prolong the Sino-Japanese War, and exacerbate the hostility between Chongqing and Nanjing. (Reuters dispatch of the 12th)</p>
<p>Tokyo – The "Asahi Shimbun" today believes that the recent implementation of the iron ore export license system by the United States and the British loan to Chongqing are "joint Anglo-American pressure on Japan." The newspaper stated that Britain and the United States should be aware that their actions are sufficient to hinder the restoration of peace in China, and that these actions are opposed by Japan. It also learned that the "Asahi Shimbun" has repeatedly launched major attacks on a "joint Anglo-American Far Eastern front" in recent days. (United Press dispatch of the 12th)</p>
<p>Washington – Japan purchases as many as 150 types of war materials from the United States every day, including ten basic chemical raw materials, thirteen basic metals and raw ores, sixteen industrial raw materials and alloys, thirty-two machine tools for manufacturing machinery, and gasoline, lubricating oil, etc. In terms of military equipment, Japan purchases eighteen types of bombs, twenty-one types of poison gas, twenty-nine types of fire extinguishers, and firearms, etc. Japan is also buying blueprints for manufacturing aircraft engines and tanks. (United Press dispatch of the 12th)</p>
<p>Washington – Reports from Vietnam indicate that Japan is assembling troops on the islands between Vietnam and Borneo, with the aim of blockading Singapore. People here are quite skeptical of this, believing that Japan is unlikely to take any action in the short term that would lead to open armed conflict with Britain, as the Axis powers are currently losing ground and there is no non-aggression pact between Japan and the Soviet Union for protection. In addition, the British grant of a new loan to China, the new American restrictions on the export of goods to Japan, and the concentration of the US Navy in Hawaii can all curb Japan's adventurous ambitions. According to many observers here, the British loan to China acknowledges that the European and Asian wars are fundamentally one and the same, and will, for all practical purposes, make China an ally of Britain to resist the Nazi goal of controlling the world. The New York Times published an article stating that the wars in Europe and Asia have merged into one, and China's ability to resist is becoming increasingly important. It also stated that a recent book by Soviet Commissioner Motilyov is highly noteworthy. It states that Japan's currency inflation, economic exhaustion, and lack of raw materials are gradually becoming critical, and that this phenomenon has led to a high degree of social tension. The book predicts that the Sino-Japanese War has reached its third stage. Japan initially had the upper hand, then entered a period of stagnation, and now the main force has shifted to the Chinese side. The book is intended for sale in the Soviet Union and does not indicate any Soviet intention to Sovietize China, which the author of the New York Times article considers extremely important. The book also contains no words of comfort to Japan. If it were intended to prepare Soviet readers to sacrifice China's interests in order to deal with Japan in the future, such words would inevitably have been included. (Reuters dispatch of the 12th)</p>
<h3>United States Taking Appropriate Steps; Far Eastern Policy Developing Strongly</h3>
<p>Washington – The New York Times' statement yesterday that the European and Asian wars are ultimately one war can be confirmed by the recent activities of the British and American governments. Both the United States and Britain have successively provided loans to China, and the United States has imposed restrictions on the export of metallic materials. All of these actions cannot be regarded as assistance to China and other countries resisting Nazi aggression, but as a blow to Japan. American finances are now concentrated in Hawaii. Although this is said to have no diplomatic significance, Japan will definitely pay considerable attention to it. The new restrictions on metal exports are clearly aimed at Japan, because the previous ban on metal exports to Japan was still loose and exploitable, but now it is effectively restricted to block the loopholes. People here are well aware that the United States will take other appropriate steps as needed based on the situation. According to reports from the Far East, American expatriates in the Far East seem surprised by the recent firm advice to American expatriates to withdraw from the East. They may not be able to foresee the strong development of American Eastern policy, although not rapid, and deeply understand the transformation of the national sentiment in their home country; otherwise, they would not be so surprised. According to Washington politicians, the mood in Congress is gradually changing, and the call of "We must not participate in the war" is rarely heard now. The American people still have a desire not to easily participate in the war, but as the new form of Nazi policy in Europe and Asia has become increasingly clear, Congress has the feeling that the United States must take some steps for its own safety. In short, as the New Year approaches and Congress is about to convene, the current image of the United States is to say less empty words and do more practical things.

<h3>US Naval Reservists Ordered to Other Duties; Two Thousand Report for Duty on Ships</h3>
<p>Washington – The US Navy Department announced last night that 1,900 naval reservists have been ordered to report for duty on various ships. (Reuters dispatch of the 12th)</p>
<h3>US Grants Separate Loans to Two South American Countries</h3>
<p>Washington – According to an announcement by Loan Administrator Jones, the United States is now lending 60 million yuan to Argentina and 7.5 million yuan to Uruguay. (Reuters dispatch of the 11th)</p>
<h3>Roosevelt to Return to Washington Next Week; To Consider British Loan Issue</h3>
<p>Washington – According to reliable sources yesterday, senior US government officials have recently learned that Britain needs to borrow money from the United States because its current funds will soon be exhausted. It is said that a senior British government official has already raised this issue with US Treasury Secretary Morgenthau. It is heard that President Roosevelt will return to Washington next week after inspecting the defenses of the Caribbean and will consider this issue upon his return. (International News Agency dispatch of the 12th)</p>
<h3>US Issues National Defense Bonds; 500 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>Washington – The Treasury Department yesterday issued bonds worth a total of 500 million US dollars for national defense programs. This is the first time this has been done in American financial history. The interest rate on these bonds is 0.25 percent, and they cannot be cashed before the maturity date of December 15, 1945. (United Press dispatch of the 12th)</p>
<h3>US-Japanese War Inevitable; US Missionary Speech</h3>
<p>Atlantic City – Mr. Warnshuis, Secretary of the New York Branch of the National Council of Churches, said in a speech at the Federal Council of Churches last night that if the United States continues its current policy, a war between Japan and the United States is inevitable. Mr. Palmer, President of the Chicago Theological Seminary, advocated that members of the clergy hold a meeting with leaders of the American government to discuss the Far Eastern situation. (United Press dispatch of the 12th)</p>
<h3>Quezon and Sayre's Quarrel; US Officials Considering</h3>
<p>Washington – Reliable sources said yesterday that administrative officials involved in Philippine affairs are preparing to send a memorandum to the US President regarding the recent quarrel between President Quezon and US High Commissioner to the Philippines Sayre. It is said that the conclusion of the memorandum is not entirely in favor of Sayre, because Quezon recently attacked Sayre for telling the press that President Roosevelt had rejected the amendment to the Philippine Constitution. Officials from the Bureau of Insular Affairs have discussed the statements of Sayre and Quezon. Some reliable sources also believe that the United States may appoint another commissioner to replace Sayre, but the government has not actually discussed this yet. It is also heard that Secretary of the Interior Ickes has personally expressed dissatisfaction with the general situation in the Philippines, and that most insular affairs officials are biased towards Sayre. However, insular affairs officials ultimately advocate finding a way to deal with this situation. The people generally consider Rear Admiral Yarnell, Commander of the Asiatic Fleet, and Democratic Senator King to be possible successors to Sayre as High Commissioner to the Philippines.

<h3>Philippine Island Disaster; Catanduanes Island Suffers Hundreds of Thousands in Losses</h3>
<p>Manila – The Philippine Secretary of the Interior received a report from the Governor of Albay Province that Catanduanes Island was swept by a typhoon on Friday, killing sixty people, injuring hundreds, and leaving several missing. The damage to fields and public buildings is estimated at several hundred thousand Philippine pesos. The governor is now requesting an appropriation of 100,000 pesos for relief.

<h3>Joint Military-Political Conference Held in Tokyo Yesterday; Rumor that Japanese Government Receives Military Support; To Take Over All Industries Not Facing Crisis</h3>
<p>Tokyo – Government and army and navy leaders held the second joint conference from 11:20 a.m. to 12:40 p.m. this afternoon. Government attendees included Prime Minister Konoe, Foreign Minister Matsuoka, Army Minister Tojo, Navy Minister Oikawa, and Minister without Portfolio Hiranuma. Army and Navy attendees included Lieutenant General Tanaka, Chief of Staff of the Army General Staff, and Vice Admiral Kondo, Chief of Staff of the Navy General Staff. (United Press dispatch of the 12th)</p>
<p>Tokyo – Well-informed sources say that although the domestic situation allows for the industrial sector's situation to be quite tense, the cabinet has obtained the support of the military to take over all industries that are not facing a crisis. There has been widespread speculation here that there will be changes in the cabinet, but this rumor has been dispelled by the fact that the military is supporting the government to control industry. (United Press dispatch of the 12th)</p>
<p>Japanese Ministry of Finance to Revise Paper Money Issuance System</p>
<p>Tokyo – It was learned today that the Ministry of Finance will submit a law to revise the Bank of Japan's paper money issuance system to the next Diet session. The main purpose is to formulate a legal system for the Ministry of Finance to stipulate the maximum amount that can be issued on a yearly basis, according to the French method from 1870 to 1918. The Bank of Japan's current reserves are divided into two categories: gold and silver, and securities. The revised system will establish total reserves and include gold and silver coins, gold and silver bars, government securities, and commercial bills. The exchange system will be retained, as the Bank of Japan issues a huge amount of paper money every day, so this revision is necessary. The Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Japan's bureau have agreed on preliminary measures. As far as can be ascertained, it is not yet decided whether the paper money issuance system of the Bank of Korea and the Bank of Taiwan will also be revised, or whether the Bank of Japan's paper money will replace the paper money of these banks.

<h3>British Ambassador Lord Lothian Died in Washington Yesterday; Gave Written Speech on Eve of Death; Said Italy Has Been Hit and Begun to Collapse</h3>
<p>Washington – British Ambassador to the United States Lord Lothian passed away this morning at the British Embassy here. As of now, no further news has been released regarding this matter. Lord Lothian had been ill for several days and was unable to attend a joint conference of the US Department of Agriculture last night to give a speech, which was delivered by the Embassy Counselor in his stead. Lord Lothian was 48 years old and was appointed as the British Ambassador to the United States last April, succeeding Sir Ronald Lindsay. He suddenly went to London last month to discuss a certain matter with the British government. After returning to Washington, he told reporters that Britain would soon need financial assistance to carry out the war. Before entering the diplomatic world, Lord Lothian was a journalist. In 1916, he was appointed as the Prime Minister's Secretary and then transferred to the India Office to attend the parliamentary session. (Reuters dispatch of the 16th)</p>
<p>Washington – British Ambassador to the United States Lord Lothian died of uremia at the British Embassy here at 2:00 a.m. this morning. (United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Washington – British Ambassador to the United States Lord Lothian passed away at the British Embassy here at 3:00 a.m. today at the age of fifty-eight. Lord Lothian had recently visited England and returned to the United States less than three weeks ago. Lord Lothian's death was sudden. He felt unwell yesterday and was unable to give a speech in Baltimore, which was delivered by the Embassy Counselor on his behalf. Lord Lothian was appointed as the Ambassador to the United States in April 1939. He got along well with Americans and was well-liked by journalists for his straightforward nature and willingness to frankly state Britain's position and needs. (United Press dispatch of the 12th)</p>
<p>Baltimore – British Ambassador to the United States Lord Lothian said yesterday that "Britain has won the second stage of the war in 1940, but 1941 will be a 'dangerous period.'" He declared, "We are not discouraged. With your help, we will surely win. We have confidence that we will win in 1942, or even earlier." Lord Lothian also said, "Italy has begun to collapse. The heroic Greeks have dealt a fatal blow to Mussolini's dignity." His speech was read by British Embassy Counselor Butterworth. The speech stated that the British air battle in mid-September had completely shattered the German plan to invade Britain, and that Germany's victory in Norway and France had become dim.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Recent Actions of Britain and the United States and China</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the New York Times commented on the latest international trends, believing that the two sets of wars in Europe and Asia are ultimately one war; it cited the recent activities of Britain and the United States, as well as the fact that both the European and Asian wars were driven by aggression and counter-aggression, as evidence. This judgment has its basis and can be seen as beneficial to China's international position in the war of resistance; but at least so far, we can hardly agree to this judgment unconditionally: first, there is fundamentally no hostility between China and Germany; although Germany has repeatedly given China infuriating stimuli, such as the Tripartite Pact, which China cannot ignore, the expressions made by Germany after the fact are enough to offset most of the unpleasant feelings that China has towards Germany. Second, the Asian war has always had room to be isolated from the flames of Europe, and so far there is even a reason for all parties to cooperate in first suppressing the aggression in Asia and seeking stability in Asia first; not only is there a reason, but there is also the possibility, as long as all parties cooperate effectively; and the achievements of Greece give this aspect better time and space. If the subsequent evolution of facts is still as sparse and circuitous as in the past few years, then what the New York Times said will ultimately be correct.</p>
<p>Examining the trends, it is true that the past and present have changed. For example, using the same arguments adopted by the New York Times, our conclusion is not that the two wars have merged. Instead, it is (1) the international division in Asia is more obvious, (2) the speed of exerting pressure on Japan has accelerated, the density has increased, and the intensity has strengthened, and (3) the number of wins and losses has completed a clear outline. For example, US President Roosevelt personally announced a confirmed loan of US$50 million to China and another US$50 million with undetermined methods. Within ten days, not only did the United States immediately follow up with the fleet's gathering in Hawaii and new restrictions on gold exports, but Britain also announced a loan of £10 million to China before the details had been determined. Such a force of tremendous force, like a sudden thunder and rain, followed one after another. Considering the parallel cooperation of Britain and the United States, the strong support for China, and the display of an unrelenting and uncompromising attitude towards aggression, its speed, density, and strength can at least be described as unprecedented in the past decade. What is even more special is that it is indeed unprecedented that the British and American loans were announced as established as soon as possible without waiting for all the methods to be detailed; this atmosphere is by no means a small detail that should be regarded as a branch in international exchanges; it is a sign that Britain and the United States are in high spirits and acting urgently towards China and Asia. Just compare this with the sparseness and circuitousness that everyone has felt in the past few years, and you can understand the meaning of this determination and urgency. Therefore, we do not have to confuse the two wars in Europe and Asia into one view. Only within the scope of the Asian war, the fact that Britain and the United States stand on China's side without any consideration of any reaction, the main point is not to say that the firmness of US national policy has been proven again, nor is it necessary to say that Britain no longer hesitates on the fork in the road of conflict and compromise with Japan, but it shows that there is absolutely no room for shaking and changing the battle line in the Asian war, that is, it eliminates the Japanese side's long-standing delusion that there is still room for it to play with internationally. Comparing this trend with the Japanese side's diplomatic offensives such as the Tripartite Pact four months ago and the Matsuoka talks the other day, as well as its political and military offensives in China, it can be seen that Japan's complete failure is indeed only remaining with two questions: one is when will Japan choose to admit its failure in words and actions? One is whether Japan will bet its desperate stake between the Pacific and Indian Oceans before admitting failure? In addition, there is no more room for experimentation, and there is no more room for doubt. And as the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun commented yesterday: "It is clear that Britain and the United States have agreed on a plan to jointly exert pressure on Japan, and this is only part of their plan," it can be seen that the Japanese are also aware of what they will encounter in the future.</p>
<p>Here is what the Chinese government and people should realize: in the last moment before Japan confirms its failure, it is very likely that it will carry out its final devastation and destruction of China from the military side, such as the so-called autumn offensive in the southwest of Taihu Lake and the so-called winter offensive on both sides of the Xiang River. Although the Japanese side was successively defeated due to China's counterattacks, the Chinese military and people still need to continue to prepare for more painful sacrifices than in the past forty months to resist the attacks aimed at devastation and destruction in various war zones, and to accelerate its overall collapse. The recent British and American loans to China are all related to Chinese finance, which is effective and valuable assistance; with such assistance, the exchange rate remains stable, which is an excellent way for China and Britain and the United States to prevent the outflow of Chinese capital; however, in a situation where the overall situation has the possibility of a sharp turn downwards, businessmen should be most careful to prevent the economic impact of this shock; it is only by breaking the superstition of the value of goods and strengthening the confidence in the value of legal tender that the degree of change can be reduced and unnecessary losses in the change can be avoided.</p>
<h3>Thai Anti-American Sentiment Rapidly Increasing; US Goods See Significant Sales Decline in Thailand; Large Quantities of Japanese Goods Arrive in Thailand for Dumping</h3>
<p>Bangkok - Anti-American sentiment here is rapidly increasing because the U.S. State Department has expressed its stance against Thailand's claims to former territories from Vietnam. Thai circles today believe that among the three Far Eastern powers (Britain, the United States, and Japan), two have already recognized the legitimacy of Thailand's demands. Only the U.S. resolutely opposes any action that could "drag the country into war." The U.S. seems to believe that if Thailand were to engage in war, it could escalate into a major conflagration, potentially drawing in the Far East, because the U.S. might be forced to fight in the Pacific Ocean to uphold the "status quo." How Britain, the U.S., and Japan will position themselves is of utmost importance should a large-scale war break out between Thailand and Vietnam. According to Thai observations, if none of these three countries steps forward to support them, French resistance will undoubtedly be extinguished. As of now, only the U.S. has expressed its official opinion on the Thai-Vietnamese conflict. Besides reiterating its "status quo" policy, the State Department has repeatedly hinted at the government's views, such as the recent detention of ten U.S.-made bombers destined for Thailand in Manila. This attitude of the U.S. is causing great anxiety in Thailand, as Thailand has relied on the U.S. for the majority of its military supplies since the outbreak of the European war. American merchants in Bangkok are also uneasy about the U.S.'s attitude towards Thailand. The recent significant decline in sales of American goods in Thailand represents the Thai people's anti-American sentiment. Some fear that this attitude of the U.S. may force Thailand to embrace Japan. Japanese merchants have already seized this opportunity to ship large quantities of Japanese goods to Thailand for dumping. Although Japan has not yet formally expressed its official opinion, the Thai people generally believe that Japan sympathizes with Thailand. (Reuter/United Press, 12th)</p>
<p>Japanese Side Demands Vietnamese Governor Suppress Pro-British Elements</p>
<p>Hanoi - Members of the Japanese delegation here and other Japanese officials believe that the current situation in southern Vietnam is "quite similar to Norway before it was occupied by German forces." These Japanese insist on their view that the British in Singapore are planning to attack Saigon, so the activities of the local Tegor Party members should be stopped immediately. They also claim that there are many pro-Chiang Kai-shek elements in Saigon who should be eliminated. Since November 1, the Japanese have repeatedly demanded the occupation of Saigon and control of Saigon's customs, but each time, the demand has been withdrawn due to the need for further consideration. Replacing this demand is the Japanese demand to Vietnamese Governor General Decoux, asking him to suppress the pro-British and pro-Chiang elements in the south. (United Press, 12th)</p>
<p>Vietnam Still Willing to Negotiate Settlement of Demands on Thailand</p>
<p>Tokyo - According to news from Hanoi, the Vietnamese authorities in charge stated solemnly yesterday that their attitude towards Thailand remains unchanged. Vietnam is still willing to resolve border disputes with Thailand at any time through negotiation, but Vietnam is also determined to respond to enemy measures with hostile actions.

<p>Shanghai French Official Denies Suspension of Vietnamese-Japanese Talks</p>
<p>Local News - Several newspapers in this city today carried reports saying that Japanese troops are preparing to land in Saigon. Informed French sources here were greatly surprised upon hearing this news, as all the information received by the French authorities in Shanghai is completely contradictory to such rumors. In addition, there are reports that the economic talks planned between France and Japan will be abandoned and the delegation sent by the French government will cancel its trip to Japan. Informed French sources here also denied this claim, saying that the French delegation referred to is led by former Vietnamese Governor General Robin, who departed from France on the 4th of this month to come east. Once he arrives in Japan, he will, according to the original plan, meet with the delegation sent by the Governor General's office of Vietnam (currently passing through Shanghai) to conduct negotiations with the Japanese side without any changes.

<p>Thai Aircraft and Artillery Continue to Attack Vietnam</p>
<p>Hanoi - An official communiqué recently announced that "several Thai aircraft flew over Bangkate City, Laos, Vietnam, at 8:30 a.m. yesterday, dropping over a dozen bombs, causing minor damage to local houses, but fortunately no casualties. This morning at 9:30 a.m., six more Thai aircraft flew to the Pakese airfield, dropping three bombs, causing neither casualties nor any losses. In addition, five Thai aircraft flew over Viet Tri City, dropping two bombs, all landing in rice paddies, and strafing the ground with machine guns, also without casualties." (Havas, 11th)</p>
<p>Bangkok - The Thai Supreme Command recently announced that yesterday, Thai forces used artillery, rifles, and machine guns to fiercely fire at Taek on the Vietnamese southern border across the Mekong River. At the same time, the Thai air force bombed the airfields of Taek, Viet Tri, and Savannakhet. On Tuesday morning, when French artillery shelled Mek Dara (transliteration) in Savannakhet, one Thai aircraft was shot down, killing eleven French soldiers. (United Press, 12th)</p>
<p>Singapore - The Thai Consulate here issued a communiqué today stating that the Thai Air Force, in retaliation for French bombing of Thai territory, has raided Bonteat and Banapope across the Vietnamese border. As long as the French bombing does not stop, Thailand's retaliation will continue. If the French authorities send a delegation to Bangkok based on the agreement reached in October, the Thai government still intends to negotiate border demarcation based on international practices. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>Vietnamese and French Authorities Announce Border Conflict Incidents</p>
<p>Yu Bian - French authorities recently told reporters that a series of incidents, including aerial bombings and border skirmishes, mostly occurred in Poipet (transliteration), located in the center of the Thai-Vietnamese railway and highway. Although Thailand's initial major offensive against Vietnam may have been to attack the area near Poipet leading to Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, Cambodia is currently very quiet because the province has been fully prepared and has clearly demonstrated its strength. Aircraft fly over the area every day without attacking. As for the border, Thai and Vietnamese troops exchange machine-gun fire almost daily. French authorities claim that French forces have now established a line of defense several miles from the border. This area, according to the Franco-Thai agreement, should be a demilitarized zone, but since Thai aircraft have appeared over this area, the so-called Franco-Thai agreement is also equivalent to waste paper. Authorities also said that the border conflict was actually caused by Thais frequently firing machine guns at various towns and looting, and that the activities of the Fifth Column in Cambodia have failed. These activities were carried out by communists and some high-ranking Buddhists who had studied in Bangkok. The party members have been detained. (United Press, 12th)</p>
<p>Vichy - The French Colonial Ministry issued a communiqué last night describing the French air force's retaliatory bombings of Vietnam, stating that two Thai aircraft formations bombed Savannakhet, dropping thirteen bombs, causing considerable damage but no casualties. The French air force retaliated by bombing the Gotan airfield in Min Tiemipei, dropping one and a half tons of bombs. During an air battle over Savannakhet, one Thai aircraft was shot down, and another was damaged. (Haitong News Agency, 12th)</p>
<p>Hanoi - The Vietnamese government formally announced that French aircraft dropped three tons of bombs in Udom (transliteration) and Sakon Nakhon (transliteration), west of Taek, last night, in retaliation for Thai aircraft attacks on Vietnam. The mission of the French aircraft can be said to have been accomplished. It was also stated that it is now possible to speak with the French Minister to Thailand, Garut, as there had been no communication with Garut for two weeks. Officials also strongly stated that the communist turmoil in Cochinchina has been suppressed, and the situation there is completely under government control. Governor Decoux of Vietnam will inspect the south in the coming days. (United Press, 12th)</p>
<p>Vietnamese Governor Decoux Increases Bodyguard</p>
<p>Hanoi - Vietnamese Governor-General Lieutenant General Decoux has increased his personal bodyguard because there are rumors that a naval officer intends to assassinate Decoux. Although the news of the plot to harm Decoux's life has not been confirmed, four Japanese men rode horses into the governor's mansion grounds and galloped back and forth in front of the mansion.

<h3>Major Victory for British Forces in North Africa; Capture of Sidi Barrani; Two Italian Divisions Surrounded; Three Senior Generals Captured</h3>
<p>Cairo - British forces in North Africa, taking advantage of their victory yesterday, advanced and occupied Sidi Barrani, the forward base of the Italian forces, achieving a sensational victory. The Italian forces were routed, retreating to Libya. In less than three days since the British offensive began, a decisive victory has been achieved. As British mechanized units advanced rapidly and occupied this important seaport, they seized large quantities of military supplies and captured many prisoners, including three senior Italian generals. According to unofficial estimates here last night, between 10,000 and 20,000 Italian soldiers were captured, including officers of all ranks. After being occupied by Italian forces advancing from Libya, Sidi Barrani became the base for the Italian offensive against British forces. According to Italian predictions, an Italian offensive from this location could drive the British out of Africa. (International Telegram, 12th)</p>
<p>London - British forces, launching a lightning-fast operation in the western Egyptian desert, have captured Sidi Barrani, a key forward base for the Italian forces in the western desert, dealing a fatal blow to the Italian attempt to conquer Egypt. According to a communiqué issued in Cairo, after Sidi Barrani fell into British hands, the war continued satisfactorily. The important point of this battle is that the British captured a large number of enemy troops and war materials. Another communiqué stated that three Italian generals were captured. The British victory around Sidi Barrani was due to the implementation of a carefully planned strategy. British armored forces first attacked the enemy's right flank, then broke through behind the enemy, while British forces launched a fierce frontal attack on the enemy positions fifteen miles east of Sidi Barrani at Maqtila, achieving a great victory. Several Italian divisions were attacked from all sides, and seeing their retreat cut off, they fell into chaos.</p>
<p>It is reported from London that General Wavell, commander of the British forces in the Middle East, will soon officially announce the details in Cairo. The British forces led by Wavell have now broken into the middle of the Italian forces in the Sidi Barrani area and the Italian forces supporting them from afar in the west. Compared with the Albanian campaign, the front line in Egypt is extremely long, extending over 3,500 miles from Libya to Italian East Africa, longer than the border between Canada and the United States. For mechanized troops, this is the best time to fight in Egypt, as the desert is more solid at this time than at any other time. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>London - British military authorities here recently stated that because two Italian divisions are trapped in Sidi Barrani, the British forces in the western desert have a good opportunity to capture approximately 28,000 to 34,000 more Italian soldiers. When the British forces attacked Sidi Barrani, they also captured three Italian generals, one being General Gariboldi, one being General Bergonzoli, and one being General Mersa-Matrouh. British authorities also stated that we have now captured an Italian general, and if our hopes are realized, the large amount of Italian supplies in the Sidi Barrani area will become a gift to us. (United Press, 12th)</p>
<p>London - The British forces in the western desert are now continuing to put pressure on the Italian forces. British naval and air forces continue to obstruct the retreating Italian troops from time to time. There is fierce fighting in the Buq Buq area west of Barrani. The area was occupied by British forces yesterday, fifteen miles west of Sidi Barrani. According to sources here, most of the Italian forces in Sidi Barrani and its vicinity have had their retreat cut off. It is likely that two divisions (between 14,000 and 17,000 men) will be captured by British forces. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>Cairo - A naval communiqué issued here last night stated that the British navy bombarded the Italian forces retreating along the coast on the nights of December 10 and 11, and shelled the Italian forces on the roads around Sollum. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>British Air Force Conducts Extensive Operations</p>
<p>Cairo - The British Air Force in the Middle East launched an extremely fierce attack yesterday, bombing airfields, troops, and motor transport vehicles in the desert area of Italian Libya all day long, inflicting great damage. According to a British Air Force communiqué, British aircraft carried out such extensive activities for 24 hours, and only one aircraft did not return. Six Italian aircraft were confirmed shot down, and another three Italian aircraft lost control. British aircraft attacked the El Adem airfield very fiercely last night, destroying several more enemy aircraft, and high-explosive bombs set fire to several aircraft hangars. The flames soared high, and could still be seen 60 miles away. British aircraft also dropped many bombs on motor transport convoys and enemy barracks concentrated in the Bardia and Sollum areas, bombing fiercely. The British Naval Air Arm also cooperated with the British Air Force, attacking the Bardia barracks and the roads on the Sollum slopes. In addition, British aircraft bombed a landing field, and another enemy aircraft was destroyed on the ground in Gazala. The total number of enemy aircraft destroyed yesterday reached ten, and the number of damaged aircraft is unknown. (Haitong News Agency, 12th)</p>
<p>British and Egyptians Greatly Excited</p>
<p>London - An important official of the Egyptian government told a Reuters interviewer that the capture of Sidi Barrani by British forces was greatly praised, saying that the news would excite the entire territory of Egypt. The Italian defeat has dispelled all doubts about the security of Egypt. All public entertainment venues in Cairo have announced this victory. The Egyptians were extremely enthusiastic upon hearing the news, cheering for Britain. All newspapers published this news in a special position on the front page. The "Al-Ahram" newspaper used the phrase "What is ours has been returned to us" from the Quran as the headline for the news. Military figures in London were also very pleased to receive the news, but pointed out in cautious tones that there is no question of a complete Italian collapse. It is said that more Italian troops will undoubtedly be captured, but the battlefield is still "fluid." Some surrounded enemy troops have the possibility of breaking out, as the British forward units are widely dispersed. Although three Italian generals were captured, it does not necessarily mean that all three divisions of the enemy were captured, as the three generals may all belong to the same division. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>Blackshirts Depart to Front Lines as Reinforcements</p>
<p>Rome - It is reported from here that 50,000 British troops are attacking Sidi Barrani, and the Italian forces are doing their best to defend it. The battle is extremely fierce. A thousand Italian Blackshirt troops have departed from Libya by truck to reinforce it. The British forces are composed of Australian and New Zealand soldiers and elite British Scottish troops. Over a thousand British mechanized troops are coming in force, most of which are trucks equipped with huge steamships that travel at 40 miles per hour, each carrying 6,000 soldiers and several machine guns. General Graziani, Governor of Libya and Commander-in-Chief of the Italian forces in Africa, has been defending the area strongly for several months because Sidi Barrani controls the main highway and transportation lines and its position is extremely important.

<p>British Air Force General Arrives in Cairo</p>
<p>Cairo - The British attack on the Italian forces in North Africa is becoming increasingly tense. British Air Chief Marshal William Tait has personally arrived in Cairo to command the Near East Air Force. Tait is replacing Air Chief Marshal Owen Boyd, who went missing at the end of November.

<h3>Fate of Italy Depends on War on Both Sides of the Mediterranean</h3>
<p>New York - Britain is now doing its best to replay the Battle of Dunkirk, but this battle situation is completely different from the last one. The British Air Force is taking the offensive, while the enemy is fleeing in panic. The purpose of the British forces fighting Mussolini's troops simultaneously in Albania and Egypt is to achieve this. If victory is achieved in one place, or both places are successful, the world may witness a military collapse unprecedented in history. Churchill's speech describing the safe evacuation of 300,000 besieged British troops from Dunkirk is still fresh in our memory, how the dark-faced, tired, and disappointed British troops boarded battleships, transport ships, speedboats, sampans, or even flat-bottomed boats, and crossed the English Channel under the wings of Nazi bombers unscathed. But Mussolini can no longer hope for a repeat of the miracle of Dunkirk, because the situation in the Mediterranean and the English Channel is very different from what it was in the past. The British troops stationed in Dunkirk often used the help of dense fog in the English Channel to block the vision of German bombers, and the British army often received the help of naval soldiers of all ranks, but Mussolini does not have this kind of maritime advantage. The most unfavorable thing for the Italian forces is that the Mediterranean and the Adriatic Sea are often bathed in brilliant sunshine. If the Italian forces, when necessary, abandon their bases in Africa and return home by sea, the British Air Force stationed in Malta and various government islands can strike the Italian forces from beginning to end. It is reported that Italian Foreign Minister Count Ciano set off for Berlin yesterday to consult with the German side, but Ciano may get nothing, because the Germans are usually very cautious and are unwilling to throw themselves into the trap set by the Italian Prime Minister for himself. (International Telegram, 12th)</p>
<p>London - A Reuters military commentator said that the British capture of Sidi Barrani in Africa shows that the British have won a great victory. If they can continue to make persistent efforts, the morale of the Italian army and the domestic political situation in Italy will have a huge reaction. Judging from the brief news we have now, the British forces seem to be moving forward with great effort and determination, in order to take advantage of the existing British advantages and obtain greater benefits. The Libyan problem is not another problem, but is connected to the Greek war and should be regarded as one thing. The British forces must not give the Italian forces a chance to breathe at any point, and maintain maximum pressure in order to win a decisive victory. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>Athens - Greek newspapers commented on the victory of the British forces in Africa, saying that the fascist regime is now collapsing. The last hope of the fascists lies in the troops under Graziani. Now this army has been defeated. The British army is brave and can continue to make persistent efforts, and give the Italian forces in Africa a really good lesson. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<h3>British Military Commentator Discusses the War Situation</h3>
<p>London, Reuters - A military commentator stated, based on recent news from Cairo, that the opportunity to inflict another blow on the Italians in Libya had not been missed. General Graziani of the Italian forces rashly advanced his troops to Sidi Barrani and has now suffered a major defeat. Some Italian generals have been captured or killed, and over four thousand Italian soldiers have been captured. The British forces have also seized many tanks. This initial success of the British counter-offensive is truly exhilarating. However, it is still too early to speculate on the final outcome of these battles. The Italian army may be forced to retreat along the line and suffer a major defeat, or its main force around Sidi Barrani may break through and escape. However, there is also the possibility that the Italian army will suffer an even greater defeat. The battle situation on the road between Sollum and Sidi Barrani along the slope of the Libyan plateau may change. The British army will launch an encirclement operation to completely destroy the Italian army, and this is not limited to one place. Since the British have control of the sea, the British Navy may protect the landing of troops. Officials in Tobruk acknowledge that the large scale of this operation requires special efforts and involves significant risks, but the current timing is quite favorable because the enemy's morale has undoubtedly been greatly shaken, making it not difficult to defeat them in one fell swoop. A similar situation was seen during the collapse of the French army, where small German units disregarded the French army and actually penetrated deep into France and occupied Bordeaux. Now is the time for Britain to inflict a major blow on Italy. The active operations of the British Navy and Air Force have already made the enemy feel their power. It is gratifying that General Wavell, Commander-in-Chief of the British Forces in the Middle East, and Sir Wilson, commander of the Nile Division, are now using all their weapons to jointly defeat the enemy. It remains to be seen whether the British army can force the Italian army to retreat completely back to Libya. Arabs may rise up and attack isolated Italian units, and even make trouble for Italian settlers. The prospects for the Albanian war on the other side of the Mediterranean are also quite bright. Currently, Greek forces are pursuing the Italian army. Although the severe winter weather will inevitably slow down the progress of the Greek army, the retreating Italian army is also similarly affected by the weather. However, judging from past examples, in 1812, Napoleon's French army retreated from Moscow in severe cold, while the Russian army advanced through the frozen land. Which side benefited more from this advance and retreat? Today, the Italian army in Albania is in an extremely dangerous position. If the British can allocate a sufficient number of ships from the British Navy operating off the Libyan coast to Vlora, Albania, they can inflict a decisive blow on the Italian army. A naval attack on the port can cut off the retreat of half of the Italian army and prevent the reinforcement of Italian troops. It may even force the Italian fleet to engage in battle and give the British fleet the opportunity to annihilate the Italian navy. Mussolini and his fascist empire are now shaking and unstable. Can the British army carry out its initial intentions at this time and achieve complete success? This is indeed possible. (Reuters, 11th)</p>

<h3>Italian Counterattack Ineffective, Greek Army Advances into Albanian Heartland, Oil Fields in the Devoll Valley Threatened, Italian Right Wing Retreats to the Heights of Këlcyrë</h3>
<p>Athens - The Greek High Command stated this morning that the Greek army continued to advance last night in the three main war zones on the Albanian front, overcoming the "fierce" resistance of the Italian army. The Italian army launched repeated counterattacks under artillery cover, but they were all driven back. The Greek army is still taking the offensive, heading towards Vlora, Tepelena, and Elbasan, the gateway to the important Italian base of Argyrokastron. The Italian army along the Adriatic coast has retreated to the heights of Këlcyrë due to the Greek advance from Sarandë, which predicts the imminent fall of Palermë. It is also reported that two Greek columns are advancing north and west of Argyrokastron and Përmet, with their vanguard only five miles from Tepelena. The Greek army can now bombard this Italian base with artillery. A Greek official spokesman said today, "The Greek army has seized strategically valuable heights between Përmet and Tepelena. All enemy resistance has failed." It is reported that hundreds of Italian soldiers froze to death west of Pogradec. It is also heard that Greek shock troops have occupied a 5,000-foot mountain range, "The terrain of this mountain range is treacherous and the Italian army has launched several counterattacks in an attempt to regain it, but failed. (International News Agency, 12th)</p>
<p>London - The Greek army in Albania, advancing towards the Shkumbin River, has threatened the important oil resources of the Italians in the Devoll River valley. This is of great importance to Italy, as at least half of Italy's normal kerosene needs are obtained from the Devoll River valley. The Italians spent heavily in 1925 to develop this area. In 1932, the Italian government allocated 200 million lire to develop Albanian oil resources, which made considerable progress, and built a 46-mile-long pipeline to the oil port near Vlora. This pipeline began transporting oil in January 1936, and Mussolini was clearly pleased with this. In 1938, after the Italians occupied Albania, they gained absolute control over this oil field. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>Belgrade - According to front-line news received here last night, the Italian army's resistance in the northern wing of the Greek-Italian war became increasingly strong yesterday, and it was able to stop the Greek army's advance. Yesterday morning, the two sides bombarded each other with artillery, and in the afternoon they launched infantry assaults. The Greek army was repelled two kilometers west of the sea near Moscopole. West of Pogradec, the Greek army launched a fierce attack on the Italian positions, and both sides suffered heavy losses. As of last night, the battle was still continuing. The Italian army finally forced the Greek army to retreat to its original positions. The Italian army captured Udunisht, which had been occupied by the Greek army two days ago, north of Pogradec. The highway between Korçë and Pogradec was completely destroyed by Italian artillery and aircraft, making it very difficult for the Greek army to supply. Northwest of Argyrokastron, the Greek army has continued to occupy several new positions, and the Italian army has retreated to the new positions of Këlcyrë. It is expected that a fierce battle will take place in the near future. North of Delvinë, the Italian army is putting up strong resistance to stop the rapid advance of the Greek army.

<h3>Mexican President Issues Decree Abolishing Collective Farming System, Plans to Establish New Political Party</h3>
<p>Mexico - The new President of Mexico, Camacho, issued a decree abolishing the collective farming system implemented by former President Cárdenas. After the promulgation of this decree, millions of small farmers were delighted, because this decree eliminates the weaknesses of the collective farming system on the one hand, and still allows people to use farming machinery collectively, maintaining the advantages of the system. Agricultural experts believe that Mexico's agricultural production will greatly increase, and the amount of production is expected to exceed domestic consumption, which is truly gratifying. Political observers in Mexico City pointed out that the new president is planning to establish a new political party, and leaders who oppose the government faction, as well as those who served as senior officials during the former president's tenure, have the opportunity to participate in the new party. In the future, a two-party system will be implemented in Mexico. (Haitong News Agency, 12th)</p>

<p>The Painful History of the European War (5)</p>
<h3>The Truth About England and France's Hasty Entry into the War</h3>
<p>Bonnet said, "At the end of August 1939, a few days before the war, I invited the commanders of the army and air force to my residence for a talk. I told them...the war is getting closer and closer. If Poland doesn't yield, the war will be inevitable in a short time. As military authorities, if you say we don't have much confidence in winning, I will advise Poland to cede Danzig and the corridor to Germany. I also know that this method is too dangerous, and the public will scold me for selling out Czechoslovakia and now Poland. But that doesn't matter, my only concern is that the country doesn't perish. Moreover, if France falls, can Poland remain safe? Don't misunderstand, thinking that I doubt the determination to fight Germany. Germany has been preparing for war with all its might for seven years. It cannot dominate Europe with mere intimidation; sooner or later, there will be a war. But delaying the outbreak of the European war may be beneficial to us. If we can gain another year or half a year to reorganize and strengthen the army, it may also be beneficial to us. That's why I'm asking for the opinions of you generals. I also want to ask: Are there any major reasons in the military that require Poland to endure the pain of sacrifice? Although they answered individually, they all said in unison: We don't see any military reason why the war must be delayed. Although delaying the time is beneficial to us, it is also equally beneficial to Germany. Once they said that, I had nothing to say."</p>
<p>Nevertheless, he made one last effort. At one o'clock in the afternoon on August 31, the French ambassador to Italy, Ponsot, telephoned Bonnet and said: Italian Foreign Minister Ciano intends to convene a conference to resolve the Polish issue and other outstanding issues. Bonnet believed that Ciano's move was sincere. Italy was not prepared for war. Although it had signed an alliance with Germany, it still had three years to hesitate before joining the war. Moreover, Italian public opinion unanimously hated war. It is said that Ciano's final meeting with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop was not harmonious. Italy only needed to say one word at the conference, and most of the long-awaited benefits could be easily obtained without resorting to war. Such a conference would benefit both England and France, and why not Italy? Bonnet decided to do his best to support this plan. He later told me that he went directly to Daladier to tell him about this and said, "The cabinet meeting will be held at six o'clock tonight, and I will strongly urge the cabinet members to accept it, and I hope you, Prime Minister, will assist from the side. In this way, we can present a fait accompli to Germany."</p>
<p>Daladier also agreed. But Bonnet misjudged the Prime Minister's temperament. That evening at the cabinet meeting, Daladier not only did not support him but also attacked him. Although the Italian proposal was not flatly rejected, the cabinet was only willing to wait and see and wait for direct negotiations between Germany and Poland. Therefore, the cabinet communique that night only had a few words, saying that "the cabinet unanimously supports the obligations accepted by France." At dawn on September 1, the German army marched into Poland in a mighty manner.</p>
<p>At 2:15 p.m. on the second afternoon, Bonnet heard the telephone ringing in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and he couldn't help but be surprised when he picked up the receiver. There was not a word of greeting in the phone call, and he hurriedly said: "This is Ciano. Mr. Ponsot (French ambassador to Italy) and Sir Loraine (British ambassador to Italy) are here. I believe there is still a great possibility of convening a conference..."</p>
<p>Bonnet then allowed Ciano that France would never present an ultimatum to Germany before noon on Sunday. I believe that this incredible experience has not been revealed until now. France did abide by Bonnet's permission and waited until noon on Sunday to send the ultimatum to Germany, and it was not until 5:00 p.m. that it declared war on Germany. However, this fact is known to everyone. The United Kingdom declared war on Germany at 11:00 a.m. on September 3. There is a six-hour difference, and the inside story is as follows:</p>
<p>In 1939, British public opinion had reversed its attitude during the Munich Conference, and everyone was heartbroken about yielding again. Members of Parliament talked to their constituents during the holidays and saw that the people across the country had a very firm determination, and they were greatly moved. The British people believed that the war was inevitable, and the sooner the better. The members of Parliament were so moved by this public opinion that they decided not to let Chamberlain repeat the mistakes of last summer and bow down to Hitler again. Therefore, at 9:00 a.m. on September 3, British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax telephoned Bonnet and said:</p>
<p>"Your country cannot issue an ultimatum before noon. I know you have your own difficulties, but our country has not made any promises to Ciano and must send out the ultimatum this morning. The British House of Commons will meet at noon. If the Prime Minister has not fulfilled his commitment to Poland when he attends, the House will be in an uproar, and he may have to step down..."</p>
<p>Although England and France are allies, the time of declaration of war differed by six hours, and the twists and turns are like this. On September 3, 1939, the great war finally broke out. For this war, England and France were completely unprepared, but Germany had been planning for it for a long time and used clever means to make England and France declare war first so as not to bear the responsibility of starting the war.</p>
<p>Looking back on the past, we can say that at least France had already failed at the beginning of the war.</p>
<p>France's defeat was due to insufficient airplanes, insufficient tanks, insufficient anti-aircraft guns, and even more because of insufficient factories, unable to make up for the shortcomings. France's defeat was also because the number of allied troops was too small, and there was no way to quickly use the huge reserves of manpower and material resources.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the article, Churchill used a tone that surprised me during the conversation. I asked him why Britain also gave way when sanctioning Italy and allowed Italy to succeed?</p>
<p>He asked, "Have you ever paid attention to the nature of lobsters?" I replied, "I have never regarded the nature of lobsters as a thing."</p>
<p>He said, "Well! If you have the opportunity, you may wish to study it. They are very interesting. Lobsters have to shed their protective shells several times in their lives. During this period of transformation, this bravest crustacean can only lurk in the cracks of rocks and wait patiently. Once the new shell grows, it will protrude from the cracks in the rocks, re-emerge with power, and roam the sea... Due to the rashness and timidity of successive cabinets, Britain has lost its protection, and we have to temporarily lurk in the cracks of rocks, waiting for the new shell to grow strong."</p>
<p>Unfortunately, England and France were forced by the situation to finally protrude from the cracks in the rocks. Before the protective armor was completed, they met their strong enemies on the battlefield. This was also a great misfortune for the two countries!

<h3>Food Prices: Rice Hoarders Refuse to Release Stocks, Rice Prices Drop but Ultimately Rebound</h3>
<p>After several consecutive days of declines in the rice market, at the opening this morning, both buyers and sellers were still waiting and watching. It wasn't until the mid-market that some selling began, but the asking prices continued to soften. For example, No. 2 Red Pagoda was only at 87 yuan. New transactions in foreign rice continued to occur. Jian Yuan sold 1,000 tons of No. 2 Saigon, to be shipped in late January and early February, to Xiao Jiao at a price of 88 yuan. Xin Chang also sold 700 tons of No. 2 Saigon, to be shipped in late January and early February, at a price of 85 yuan. The contract prices were similar to those of the previous day. However, although the market showed some weakness, new hoarders took advantage of the low prices to absorb stocks. Holders were also unwilling to lightly release their stocks, as prices had fallen sharply by 4-5 yuan in recent days. General speculators then took the opportunity to stir things up. As a result, as soon as the market stabilized, it was quickly driven up by various buyers, rising step by step. No. 2 Red Pagoda even returned to the 87 yuan mark. At this point, buying and selling were mutually visible, and the situation was slightly stabilized. Profit-takers then took advantage of the high prices to sell, and the market price gradually fell back down. In the end, statistics showed that the city-wide fluctuations amounted to 3 yuan, but the closing price was actually about half a yuan higher than the previous market. No. 1 Saigon was at 85 yuan, 85 yuan, No. 2 at 79 yuan and 3 jiao, then down to 77 yuan. The fire mill special started at 85 yuan, fell to 80 yuan and 5 jiao. No. 2 Siam was at 77 yuan, 76 yuan and a half, Xiao Jiao at 75 yuan and a half, 75 yuan and 2 jiao, rice tea at 72 yuan and 8 jiao, 72 yuan and a half, broken rice at 70 yuan to 69 yuan, and Wuhu Bojian at 73 yuan. In the afternoon, No. 1 Saigon again reached the limit price of 87 yuan, and the fire mill also approached the limit price at 85 yuan and 8 jiao. The backflow Xiao Jiao opened at 88 yuan and then rose from 88 yuan and a half, 88 yuan and 7 jiao to 89 yuan, which was also more than 1 yuan higher. However, by the close of the market, due to new transactions, it returned to 88 yuan and a half. The total amount of spot rice opened for sale throughout the day was 10,000 bags, while the backflow of original bags was only about 300 dun.</p>
<p>The arrival of thick and thin japonica rice and other national rice was still sparse. However, the market has repeatedly declined, and people's hearts have been emptied. Therefore, the morning market continued to be sluggish, and the selling price still fell by 1-2 yuan. Following the surge in foreign rice, the overall sentiment improved. As a result, the situation stabilized. Kunshan Huojian white japonica rice was still at 95 yuan to 92 yuan, special at 98 yuan, and thin indica rice was at 87 yuan and a half, 86 yuan.</p>
<p>After glutinous rice fell short last week, the outflow has been sluggish. Yesterday, this state continued. However, due to the rebound in foreign rice, the owners were unwilling to lightly release their stocks, resulting in sparse transactions and no gains or losses in the market. Yishen white yuan continued to sell at 95 yuan and 93 yuan, and Hong Kong Baiyuan at 85 yuan and 82 yuan.</p>
<h3>A Surge of Foreign Flour: More Than 70,000 Bags Arrived Yesterday, Market Has Begun to Ease</h3>
<p>Flour: Yesterday, the price of foreign flour showed signs of loosening. The Australian flour that arrived at the port at the beginning of this month has been sold off one after another. That cargo finally arrived in Shanghai yesterday, and the number of bags loaded was only more than 70,000. Most of them had already been allocated to customers, so as soon as they arrived, there was a rush to pick them up, which was quite busy for a while. Therefore, new transactions were immediately put on hold. It was heard that only 500-600 bags of Flower Bird brand Australian flour were opened in the market at a price of 19 yuan and 3 jiao. Since a ship of American flour will arrive next week, people's hearts are relaxed. There was no change in the situation of flat-price flour, and the two factories still sold more than 6,000 bags at a price of 18 yuan. At present, the combined price of foreign flour is quite favorable. It is heard that Chinese merchants are in contact with the factories to place orders. The local flour market has become the world of foreign flour.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday's transactions were still scarce in both supply and demand. Due to the shortage of raw materials and the difficulty in purchasing foreign wheat due to ships being trapped in port, Chinese factories have raised their purchase prices by another 5 jiao. Japanese factories have also taken the initiative to raise prices to buy, which has caused the market to appear relatively lively, which is different from the trend in the flour market. It is heard that Fufeng Factory purchased more than 200 bags of Kun Du wheat yesterday at a price of 30 yuan and 5 jiao. Japanese factories also purchased 200-300 bags.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Edible Oil Bulls and Bears Battle</h3>
<p>Yesterday's edible oil sales were still sluggish, and the market was still downstream. Therefore, there was little interest in futures, and there was still selling of floating positions, and prices frequently fell. At its lowest, it fell more than 1 yuan compared to the previous day's market. In the afternoon, it was suddenly reported that Japanese firms were covering their positions in the market, which caused people's hearts to move, buying increased, and short covering turned long, and the market atmosphere suddenly became chaotic. The market price changed thousands of times in an instant, and the price difference between the rise and fall in one day reached more than 4 yuan. It is estimated that 1,500-1,600 barrels of Qingdao raw oil were traded in December, with prices falling from 109 yuan and 5 jiao to 108 yuan and 5 jiao, and finally rising to 112 yuan and 5 jiao at the close. About 700 barrels were ordered for delivery in February, with prices ranging from 108 yuan and 2 jiao and a half to 110 yuan and 8 jiao and 7.5 fen. Only 200 pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil were opened for sale in the spot market, with a price of 79 yuan.</p>
<p>In addition, 160 bags of soybeans and 3,704 pieces of soybean cake were shipped to Hong Kong today. Another 300 cans of raw oil were shipped to Little Luzon.</p>
<h3>Finance: Foreign Exchange Quiet</h3>
<p>Foreign Exchange: Yesterday's market conditions. HSBC's listed prices did not fluctuate at all. The black market for British and American exchange rates was still unremarkable.

<h3>Gold Market Weak and Unable to Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday's gold market: The dark market for melted red gold continued to weaken. It was heard that the end of this week is the third swap date for converting cash into term transactions. Later, it will be necessary to extend the swap by one month, and the discount rate will inevitably be higher than the previous two sessions. It is rumored that the buying party needs to pay the selling party about 20 yuan. People's hearts in all directions were weakened by this. The market opened at 5,773 yuan and fell to 5,775 yuan. Although a certain bank increased its purchases by 1,200-1,300 taels on behalf of bill traders, it gradually fell under the selling pressure of securities firms, retail investors, etc. In the afternoon, it saw a low price of 5,735 yuan. Finally, because foreign exchange did not loosen and British gold showed signs of softening, it slightly rebounded. The closing price was 5,754 yuan, a further decline of 19 yuan.

After the opening, a securities firm stuffed 10 taels to the bank, pressing it down by 5 yuan to 5,768 yuan. However, soon, the buying interest of small Qianzhuang and banks was still there, and they took in a little, and the price rebounded. It is estimated that the bank traded 30 taels for 5,775 yuan. It was later heard that the exchange rate loosened, coupled with the strong selling of a certain account of the securities firm, there was a lack of maintenance, and it fell sharply by 20-30 yuan.

It is estimated that the currency exchange industry sold 20 taels to the bank for 5,752 yuan. However, they continued to enter 20 taels in the bank, but only 5,745 yuan.

<p>Securities black market: Yesterday's market situation was still bullish and weak, hovering between 5 fen and 1 jiao. Only 96 surged by 7 jiao, but the buyer was only Defu, which was not enough to unify the leadership of various debts.

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Both Coarse and Fine Yarn are Needed, Shuangma Wants to Fall but Lacks Strength</h3>
<p>Yarn market: weak, and the shape is slightly soft, This is because the profit-taking bulls continue to close their positions, and the shorts come to oppress again, so they have taken a step back, But the amount absorbed by the large firms and foreign customers in the same industry remains unchanged, so the downward trend is very slow, However, the sales of spot yarn are improving, the price of 32 count single yarn is still rising, and the Tianjin gang, which has been silent for a long time, shows signs of increasing purchases of 10 count coarse yarn, There are two pieces of cotton yarn shipped to Singapore, ten pieces shipped to Little Luzon, and one hundred and twenty pieces shipped to Hong Kong today.</p>
<p>Shuangma opened in the morning, because the popularity in the afternoon of the previous day was peaceful, but retail short sellers were extremely active, The first bid price was 1,282 yuan, As soon as this bid was seen, sellers flocked to it, and soon it fell slightly to 1,277 yuan, But because the spot sales of a certain company are good, the prices of 2-count single yarn are still advancing, and there is a lack of spot supply, so they are still inclined to purchase, A certain yarn also rose by more than 10 yuan, so the buying frenzy rose suddenly, and the table suddenly tightened, and the market rose sharply, rising directly to 1,287 yuan, New buyers at this price will temporarily wait and see, The short side, seeing that the momentum has stabilized slightly, sells sharply, and the situation is threatened by it and falls, At the same time, floating accounts, seeing that the situation is loosening, close their positions one after another, so they gradually fall to the 1,272 yuan Mu Pan, Cha half-day asked the transaction statistics of 4,940 bags, the market for 20 count Shuangma fell by 10 yuan, The amount of purchases from various gangs is listed separately as left,</p>
<p>The yarn market turned better in the afternoon, and 20 count Fama made 1,280 yuan, which was 10 yuan higher than in the morning, and the sellers' intentions were light,</p>
<h3>Cotton Mill Offices: About to Move</h3>
<p>The current cotton situation has shown signs of improvement, Shenxin Two and Nine factories, after selling cotton yarn, began to buy back the raw materials to compensate, mostly 32-count and 20-count raw materials, Other factories also have the appearance of starting, Brazilian cotton price is 285 yuan, Pengjiapu is 258 yuan, Bailuo is 235 yuan, fine velvet is 259 yuan, The future of the cotton market is rising without sinking,</p>
<p>Another message on the foreign cotton market situation, The New York cotton market is quiet, falling first due to the sale of spot traders, and then the father's settlement of a part of the bulls, and the result closing price is 5-6 pounds lower than the previous day's sound, India's yesterday, including the forecast, fell by one rupee,</p>
<p>Shanghai's foreign cotton transactions, in recent days, due to the slight quiet of the yarn price, the cotton market has turned sluggish, Although the factories have the intention to purchase, they have not seen any purchases, and the thoughts of the industry are still extremely high,</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth Turns from Flat to Firm</h3>
<p>Factory Cloth: The market was stable yesterday, turning firm in the afternoon. Speculative buying by local dealers for forward wholesale transactions was relatively high, while scattered actual demand was slightly weaker. Demand from Guangdong, Hong Kong, Tianjin, and other regions remained good. Most selling prices remained unchanged, while factory prices increased by 2.5 to 5 jiao according to the market. Local dealers traded over 800 pieces of various cotton cloths for forward delivery. Guangdong and Hong Kong buyers purchased over 100 pieces of poplin, printed cloth, and colored cloth. Wenzhou, Ningbo, and Taizhou buyers purchased over 200 pieces of coarse cloth and bleached/dyed cloth.

Overseas buyers from Singapore, Little Luzon, and other places purchased over 4,000 bolts of bleached cloth, khaki drill, and other fabrics.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: First it rose, then fell, then rose again. This was due to continued strong retail sales on Mudu Street, and traders’ bullish sentiment led to aggressive buying, resulting in many transactions. Consequently, fine cloth and fine drill of various mid-range brands rose by 3 to 5 jiao per bolt. "Dragon Head" fine cloth closed at 36.6 yuan, also up 2.5 jiao. However, serge remained sluggish, falling by 2.5 to 5 li. "Four Gentlemen" closed at 1.10375 yuan.</p>
<p>Exports: Today, 135 pieces of cotton cloth were called for export to Hong Kong, 14 pieces to Little Luzon, and 54 pieces to Singapore.</p>
<h3>Feather Yarn Satin Rises Again by 2 Jiao – Due to Dyeing Costs</h3>
<p>Electric light satin and mercerized feather yarn have sharply increased by 2 jiao per yard compared to last week. This is because most of the inventory has been exhausted. Besides the slightly higher cost of new goods, the dyeing fees have increased after the dyers' strike was declared. Initially, the dyeing fee for feather yarn satin was a flat 6 yuan per bolt, regardless of length. Now, it is limited to 30 yards, and anything over 30 yards is calculated per yard at 1 jiao in legal tender. As a result, the cost has suddenly risen sharply. The commodities with larger inflows and outflows are silks, satins, and tweeds. Silk and satin shops are ignoring the new prices and temporarily holding onto their existing inventory, adopting a passive resistance. Except for those in the Hongkou area, dyeing shops are refusing to accept dyeing jobs unless the new prices are met, creating a confrontational standoff. This forces those who need to sell to anxiously raise prices. As a result, the dyeing business in the Hongkou area has recently seen a boom. The market prices for feather yarn, silk feather yarn, and electric light satin have suddenly risen by 2 jiao.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Sugar Prices Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market continued to rise due to positive sentiment. The guild's posted price for No. 24 coarse white sugar was 74.5 to 74.8 yuan per picul for foreign godown spot goods, an increase of 1.1 yuan compared to the previous day (November 11). Taikoo Granulated White also rose by several jiao, with B Mark at 73.5 to 73.8 yuan, and December end-of-month bills at 73 to 73.1 yuan, up 3 jiao. DY Mark at the West Godown was 70 yuan, and HY Mark at the West Godown was 69.7 to 70 yuan, both up 5 jiao. Spot price for Dutch Red was 57.4 yuan, and at the local godown, it was 57 to 57.2 yuan, with December end-of-month bills at 57.6 yuan, up 5 jiao. Yesterday, 1,950 bags of sugar arrived from Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Golden Needles Rise by 5 Yuan</h3>
<p>Golden needles (dried lily flowers) have recently become scarce, and the market inventory is also low, so the trend has suddenly tightened. High-quality goods have risen by 4 to 5 yuan, and production prices have also risen by 2 to 3 yuan, so market prices have followed suit. The market may tighten further in the future.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Silk Market Forecast to Be Quiet</h3>
<p>Recently, the domestic and foreign silk markets have been quite sluggish. Yokohama spot prices have not fluctuated in recent months since falling to 1,350 yuan in mid-October. New York spot prices have also remained unchanged since falling in the past two weeks. It can be seen that spot sales have practically stagnated, and speculative trading has also decreased as a result. The future of the silk market is forecast to be quiet for a period of time, so the local silk market is unlikely to flourish.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous: Even Sweet Potatoes Are Unaffordable</h3>
<p>Sweet potatoes are selling well because of the high price of rice, and their selling price has also risen with the price of rice. A month ago, sweet potatoes were still 5.5 yuan per 100 jin, but soon rose to 7.5 yuan, and now they have risen to 9.5 yuan. As for the retail price in the vegetable market, it has risen from 1 jiao to 1.6 jiao per jin. Therefore, even the very poor cannot afford sweet potatoes.</p>
<p>The market situation for winter bamboo shoots has been interrupted due to the cessation of supplies from Xiaoshan, Shaoxing, and Ningbo. Only a very small number of Hangzhou bamboo shoots have arrived, so prices are extremely high, once reaching 340 to 350 yuan per dan. Later, as the supply gradually increased, it dropped slightly to around 250 to 280 yuan. Recently, Xiaoshan bamboo shoots have been able to be transported through detours, and the supply continues uninterrupted, so the market price has gradually dropped to between 70 to 80 yuan and 120 yuan per dan. However, because the cost is too high, the price has stabilized. Even if the supply increases further in the future, it is unlikely to fall, and it is still more than doubled compared to the market price in the same period last year. In addition, the supply of canned winter bamboo shoots from Ningbo continues to be insufficient, and the price has soared to 70 yuan per case (containing four dozens), and it is still not easy to buy.</p>
<h3>Metals: Steel and Cement Are Hoarded - Rare Transactions of American Steel</h3>
<p>Cement: Recently, cement and steel have been in good demand. The amount stored in Shanghai is very low, and there are no goods coming from overseas, so the traders involved have high expectations and are harboring thoughts of hoarding. Therefore, they are raising prices every day, and increases are seen every step of the way. However, trading with out-of-town merchants remains quiet, with only local construction workers making occasional purchases. Yesterday, the asking price was 1,200 yuan per ton for fine goods, and 1,150 yuan per ton was required for rough and colored goods.</p>
<p>American Steel: The main buyers of steel are canneries, followed closely by printing factories, toy factories, cigarette factories, and biscuit factories. However, due to transportation difficulties for out-of-town merchants, transactions have greatly decreased. Yesterday, only slightly over a hundred boxes were traded. Because actual sales were not smooth, prices did not rise sharply. Old steel factories sold for around 170 yuan, and new steel factories sold for around 160 yuan.</p>
<h3>Economic Miscellany: Dry Tobacco (3)</h3>
<p>— Feng Liutang</p>
<p>The English like to smoke pipe tobacco, and it is said that former Prime Minister Baldwin was the most famous for it. It is said that the pipe came about because a scientist used wood to dig a hole to hold tobacco, and often tried smoking it in the laboratory, secretly not wanting people to know. One day, while smoking, a servant barged in and saw the room full of smoke, mistakenly thinking it was a fire, and hastily reported it to the police, and his secret was revealed, and gradually became known, so a wooden pipe was made, which is the origin of the pipe. Although the pipe of pipe tobacco and the pipe of Chinese dry tobacco differ in length and sophistication, their method of use is the same. Why is smoking so popular? It is because it can ward off foul odors, can help digestion, can refresh the mind, and is convenient to carry. Often after a meal, having a cigarette in hand becomes a habit. However, it also has its harms, because tobacco contains nicotine, a poisonous substance. The ancients said that tobacco oil can kill snakes and insects, precisely because there is nicotine in tobacco oil. Nicotine is also known as "tobacco alkali," and good tobacco leaves contain about 2%, while inferior ones contain up to 8%. It is originally a colorless oily liquid, but turns brown when exposed to air. A few drops of pure nicotine can be fatal. Therefore, the tobacco oil from a long-used old pipe can kill a snake when dripped into its mouth. Also, because nicotine is highly stimulating and has an unpleasant odor, it easily damages the brain. Burning tobacco with fire causes the fire to directly impact the throat, causing many diseases of the mouth and throat, hoarseness, all for this reason.</p>
<p>Dry tobacco is produced in various places, but the Yuanqi tobacco from Hangzhou is the best. The tobacco shreds are golden and lovely, and the aroma is sufficient. Some say it is mixed with Eupatorium fortunei pollen (i.e., Eupatorium fortunei), while others say it is mixed with sandalwood powder. However, it is too dry, so it must be slightly moistened before smoking to make the taste more harmonious, but too wet is also inconvenient for smoking. (The End)</p>

<h3>Police Officer Assault Case: Municipal Council Lodges Complaint, Rickshaw License Issue Also to Be Protested, Shanghai West Car Attack Receives Significant Attention</h3>
<p>According to the Municipal Council's Information Office yesterday morning (12th), "Regarding the case on the evening of the 8th of this month, where a police officer from the Police Department was disarmed, beaten, and detained by Japanese military police in the area outside the Shanghai West boundary road, the Chairman of the Board has already sent a letter to the Japanese Consul General to lodge a complaint." This marks the second time the Municipal Council has lodged a complaint regarding various developments after the area was blockaded. It is understood that the first resolution, proposed on the 12th, concerned Japanese-owned buses operating in Shanghai West without the Municipal Council's approval, thereby infringing upon the exclusive traffic franchise. It is generally believed that the "Municipal Government's" compelling public concession rickshaw pullers to obtain "municipal licenses" may prompt the Municipal Council to lodge a third complaint. A spokesperson for the Japanese Embassy stated that both protests raised by the Municipal Council had been received and are currently under review, with no immediate comment available.</p>
<p>Content of Protest Still Considered Moderate</p>
<p>Reporters from the Pingming News Agency have learned that the Municipal Council, led by Chairman of the Board, Mr. Kettlewell, delivered a written protest to the Japanese Consul General at 10:00 AM yesterday, lodging a complaint regarding the detention of Municipal Council police officers by Japanese military police on the afternoon of the 8th of this month. The content of the protest has not been released by the Municipal Council. However, according to reliable foreign sources, the Municipal Council based its complaint on the official report of Police Commissioner Major Bown. It is said that the wording of the protest was very moderate, expressing regret over the Japanese military police's actions, which were considered legally unjustified, but did not include requests for apologies, etc.</p>
<p>Japanese Buses Continue Operations</p>
<p>Japanese-owned buses continued to operate on Yu Yuan Road yesterday morning (12th). The Municipal Council has lodged a protest with the Japanese authorities regarding this action, which infringes upon the exclusive rights of British-owned buses and tram companies in the western district. They are currently awaiting a response.</p>
<p>Truth of the Car Attack as Reported in Western Media</p>
<p>According to the North-China Daily News, turmoil erupted again in the Shanghai West public concession road extension area last night (11th). The incident occurred around 8:15 PM when a No. 7 bus belonging to the British-owned China General Omnibus Company was traveling along Yih Ting Pan Road near Haig Road. Suddenly, about 30 thugs emerged from the roadside, their purpose not to rob, but to hurl bricks and stones at the bus and smash the windows with iron rulers and wooden sticks. The driver was also mistreated, sustaining minor injuries, but no passengers were injured. By the time police officers arrived, the thugs had scattered. Well-informed sources attach great importance to this matter, as Yu Yuan Road and Da Xi Road have been blockaded, and the British-owned buses operating in the western district are limited to the No. 7 line. Furthermore, the public concession authorities have protested against the Japanese buses operating in the western district. Responsible individuals declined to comment on whether there was a political motive behind last night's violence. The traffic department of the British-owned bus company also declined to disclose any information last night. However, Chinese sources report that two buses were involved in the disturbance. Regarding recent developments in the western district, such as the Japanese authorities erecting new barriers at the intersection of Changping Road and Yanping Road to prohibit all vehicles from passing, the Municipal Council is awaiting an official report from the Police Department.</p>
<p>Car License Issue Under Investigation</p>
<p>The public concession authorities are currently investigating the Japanese authorities' prohibition of public concession rickshaws from entering the Shanghai West road extension area. According to a Municipal Council spokesperson, the detailed circumstances of the matter are still unknown, and they are awaiting a full report from the police officer in charge of rickshaw affairs. Well-informed sources believe that the actions of the Japanese authorities and the "Municipal Government" are clearly aimed at forcing the registration of all rickshaws in Shanghai West. It is reported that plainclothes police officers have been distributing leaflets in the Shanghai West area for several days, notifying rickshaw pullers to obtain "municipal licenses." Although the leaflets stipulated Monday (the 16th) as the deadline, it was suddenly implemented on Wednesday evening (the 11th), catching most rickshaw pullers off guard and preventing them from entering the Shanghai West area.</p>
<p>Curfew Lifted in a Portion of the Area</p>
<p>The curfew originally set for the Shanghai Fourth Blockade Area from Yu Yuan Road to Da Xi Road, starting at 8:00 PM every night, was quietly lifted by the Japanese authorities yesterday without any prior notice. The barbed wire barriers along Yih Ting Pan Road were removed yesterday morning. The Japanese sentries stationed there stated that the search operation in this section has concluded, but the search of other sections is continuing. However, the sentries did not specify the location of these so-called other sections. When the reporter traveled to Di Feng Road, new barbed wire had been erected there, but it was not concentrated in one place, but scattered in a sporadic manner. This shows that the restrictions in the blockade area have been significantly relaxed, and the scope of the blockade has been greatly reduced.</p>
<h3>Rice Industry Extends Delivery Deadline, Declares It Absolutely Invalid, Extension of Delivery Period Suspected of Ulterior Motives, Mr. He De Kui Personally Questioned Yesterday</h3>
<p>It was verified that on the afternoon of the 9th of this month, authorities from the two concessions in this city convened representatives from both the Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Association and the Coarse Grain and Oilcake Industry Association at the Municipal Council to discuss and determine measures for the rice market. It was unanimously decided that from the 12th of this month, all those who purchase rice in the rice market would pay a deposit of five yuan per bag on the same day and would be required to pay for and take delivery of the goods within five days. This measure has already been announced to the public. The aforementioned measures are intended to prevent speculation and stabilize the rice market.</p>
<p>Disregarding Resolutions, Aiding Speculation</p>
<p>However, yesterday's newspapers reported that the aforementioned two associations held a joint meeting of directors and supervisors on the afternoon of the 11th, and as a result, they resolved that the delivery date for rice grain transactions in the rice market would be based on the resolution of the joint meeting of the two associations on May 8 of this year, that is, the goods would be weighed and cleared within ten days from the date of the transaction. This not only violated the original resolution of the Municipal Council meeting on the 9th of this month but also would be sufficient to fuel the evil practice of speculation in the rice market, which is extremely absurd. In view of this, Mr. He De Kui, Deputy Director of the Municipal Council, believed that strict rectification was necessary to stabilize the rice market. Therefore, yesterday afternoon, he once again summoned representatives of the two associations to the bureau and personally questioned them, ordering them to declare absolutely invalid the resolution of "weighing and clearing within ten days" that was reported in yesterday's newspapers. In the future, they must comply with the resolution of the Municipal Council meeting passed on the 9th of this month, which "limits payment and delivery of goods within five days," and implement it conscientiously, without allowing any loopholes or evasions. If they dare to violate it deliberately, once it is verified, they will be severely punished according to the law. It is heard that the representatives of the two associations have complied with the order.</p>
<p>Rice Prices Rise Again, Future Worrisome</p>
<p>Yesterday, the rice market still failed to stabilize due to the various emergency measures taken by the rice industry groups. Although speculators had once disappeared, they were active in the market again yesterday, causing the price of each grade of foreign rice to be raised by about one and a half yuan per stone. This kind of rapid change in market prices is still very worrying about the evolution of the entire rice market. According to a certain gentleman in the rice industry, before the war, rice prices would only change after three or four days, and the change in price would be small, ranging from a few cents to at most two corners per stone. Now, rice prices can fluctuate by several yuan in one hour, and those engaged in the rice trade are not surprised by this. Therefore, the rice market in the past was established to meet the needs of the public for food, but now it has become a speculative market.</p>
<p>Fellow Townsmen of Wu Prefecture Organize Collective Purchase</p>
<p>The Suzhou Shanghai Fellow Townsmen Association, in response to members' suggestions, has organized a collective rice purchase. The first batch of one thousand bags is about to be fully subscribed. All fellow townsmen of Wu Prefecture (including Suzhou, Changshu, Wujiang, and Kunshan) companies and individuals can obtain application forms from the association's clubhouse on Xin Zha Road or contact the collection agencies Yanfeng Bank Huazhangfang and Guohua Bank to complete the subscription procedures.</p>
<h3>All Chinese Detectives in the French Concession Issue a Solemn Statement, Demanding Improved Treatment Has No Effect, Chief Chinese Inspector Zhou Shang Yi Transferred to Headquarters</h3>
<p>Regarding the matter of improving the treatment of Chinese detectives in the French Concession, at 4:00 PM the day before yesterday, Mr. Blanche, Deputy Director of the French Police Department, summoned three representatives of the Chinese detectives again to hold talks, inquiring one by one about the meaning of the various conditions put forward by the Chinese detectives and the purpose of their strike. The Chinese detective representatives explained sincerely and expressed that the strike was a forced measure and had no other purpose. Mr. Blanche expressed satisfaction and stated that the conditions put forward would be forwarded to the authorities, and a satisfactory reply would be obtained in the short term, and the treatment of Chinese detectives in the French Concession would never be lower than that in the Public Concession, hoping that everyone would be able to perform their duties with peace of mind. Currently, all Chinese detectives in the French Concession are serving as usual, and the order is very good, waiting quietly for the authorities' reply.</p>
<p>Authorities' Reply Under Consideration</p>
<p>It is learned that the conditions put forward by the Chinese detectives were forwarded to Director Fabre by Mr. Blanche, Deputy Director of the French Police Department yesterday. After preliminary research by Mr. Fabre, it will be submitted to the French Consul General today. It is heard that the French Consul General may convene a meeting of the heads of the French Concession to conduct detailed discussions and overall planning. The major reply will be sent to the Chinese detective side in the near future. Among the conditions put forward by the Chinese detectives, there was an original request for the Chief Chinese Inspector to set up an office in the Central Police Station. Although the French side has not replied to the conditions, it has already issued an order yesterday morning to transfer the Chief Chinese Inspector Zhou Shangxi, who is currently stationed at the Songshan Police Station, to work at the Central Police Station, so that he can contact the Chinese detectives and police officers at any time.</p>
<p>Chinese Detectives Express Understanding of the Greater Good</p>
<p>In order to implement the request for improved treatment, all Chinese detectives in the French Concession have organized a Provisional Representative Committee of Chinese Detectives, with one representative elected from each police station to conduct everything. Yesterday, the committee issued a statement to the outside world, saying that the Chinese detectives were forced to go on strike yesterday (the 11th), causing residents in the French Concession to feel uneasy for a while, and deeply apologizing. The purpose of the Chinese detectives' request is purely to improve their lives so that they can cope with the pressure of high prices. There is absolutely no other purpose. The Chinese detectives all understand the greater good and will never be used by any party to put residents in the concession in unease. This can be comforted to all citizens. Before the authorities have replied, the Chinese detectives will serve with peace of mind and will never abandon their duties without authorization. The lives of the Chinese detectives must be improved, but it will be resolved through peaceful means. All citizens will be able to sympathize.</p>
<p>French Side Announces Immediate Resolution</p>
<p>The French Concession Police Department's Information Department yesterday denied the news of the Chinese detectives in the French Concession requesting an increase in subsidies. On Wednesday (the 11th), 15 Chinese detectives from the Xuehuali Road French Chief Police Station went on strike for one hour. There have been no new developments in this matter to date. It is said that the Chinese detectives who went on strike at that time soon returned to their posts, and no requests were made afterward. An information department officer pointed out that the police department staff had been officially notified a week ago that the French Concession Board of Directors was considering improving the treatment of waiters. According to well-informed sources, it will be announced as early as today to reassure the Chinese detectives.</p>
<h3>New Drug Industry Will Handle Overstocked Drugs in Vietnam</h3>
<p>The Shanghai New Drug Industry Association yesterday issued a notice to member pharmacies, stating: "Dear Sirs, according to member reports, it is said that reliable sources have reported that the Vietnamese authorities are about to auction our Chinese merchants' overstocked goods in Vietnam. If this is true, the losses to our Chinese people will be significant, to say the least. The report in the newspaper that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce is handling this matter is completely false. Considering that many of our fellow traders have goods blocked in Vietnam, it is not known whether your association has received this news. It is hoped that you will forward letters to the relevant traders to solicit their opinions on this matter so that plans can be made in advance. In order to save the situation, in our industry's view, the best way is to gather the various cargo owners in our industry and jointly appoint one or two special personnel to go to Vietnam to handle this matter, so as to avoid significant losses. This special letter is issued for notification. I hope you will consider it carefully and reply, etc. The Zhao Association has prepared a special letter to notify your office. If you have any opinions on the above methods, please reply within three days of receiving the letter.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Xi'an Incident Commemoration, All Circles Express Increased Loyalty</h3>

<h3>Australian New Envoy to Japan Passes Through Shanghai, Discussing the General Situation, Australia Recognizes Chongqing as the Legitimate Government of China, May Consider Sending Envoy to China</h3>
<p>Sir John Latham, the first Australian envoy to Japan, arrived in Shanghai at 3:10 PM yesterday on the British India Steam Navigation Company's ship Nanjing, and stayed at the Cathay Hotel on the Bund. At 6:00 PM, he hosted members of the press. Reporters from various newspapers were invited to attend. Regarding his views on whether it is possible to avoid armed conflict in the Pacific, Sir Latham replied that he did not know of any reason why conflict in the Pacific was unavoidable.</p>
<p>Australia and Japan Agree to Exchange Envoys</p>
<p>Sir Latham stated that there are currently no major outstanding issues between Australia and Japan. He stated that Australia cannot ignore any major changes on the eastern coast of the Pacific. He explained that the motivation for Australia and Japan to agree to exchange envoys was to obtain rapid and accurate information.</p>
<p>Always Recognized the Chongqing National Government</p>
<p>When asked whether Australia might send an envoy to the Chongqing Chinese government, Sir Latham replied that this may already be under consideration, but he did not have any definitive information. Regarding the Sino-Japanese war, Sir Latham replied that Australia, like other countries except Japan, has always recognized the Chongqing National Government as the sole legitimate government of China.</p>
<p>Australia Will Fully Support Britain</p>
<p>Sir Latham also discussed the European war, stating that Australia will provide 100% guaranteed support to Britain. Australians are determined not to live under Hitler's new order. Australia's arms manufacturing and agricultural production are self-sufficient. Since the outbreak of the European war, gold production has also increased. After implementing conscription, 250,000 soldiers can be obtained for national defense. 80,000 of them are currently being trained. Aircraft manufacturing is also increasing daily.</p>
<p>Envoy Is Current Chief Justice</p>
<p>Sir Latham pointed out that he is the second envoy in the history of the Australian government. The first one was sent to Washington. He is not a political expert and is currently still the Chief Justice of Australia. He was previously a consultant lawyer at the University of Melbourne, but he also served as a member of parliament. After the First European War, he attended the Paris Peace Conference.</p>
<h3>US New Ship USS Jackson Makes Maiden Voyage to Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>The U.S. President Lines new ship, the President Jackson, on its maiden voyage on the Far East route, arrived in port at 9:00 AM yesterday and docked at the Pudong Fourteenth and Fifteenth floating docks, and is scheduled to weigh anchor and depart Shanghai at 11:00 AM today, taking the route through Hong Kong and other places, circumnavigating the globe. Among them, 16 people boarded the ship to come to Shanghai, including several important business leaders of American companies stationed in Japan, who were evacuated from Japan to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Famous American Overseas Chinese Come to Shanghai From Japan</p>
<p>It is reported that among the 16 passengers carried by the ship to Shanghai yesterday, three passengers were famous American overseas Chinese stationed in Japan. One was Mr. Fomen, Deputy Manager of the Japan branch of the American International Telecommunications Bureau, the second was Mr. Powell, a senior member of the American Art Film Company, and the third was Mr. Ford, the Far East reporter stationed in Japan of the American International News Agency. These three famous American overseas Chinese will work in Shanghai in the future. Although the American side did not explain the reasons for their evacuation to Shanghai, it is generally believed that it was because they were unable to continue working in Japan. In addition, there are two other guests, who are also well-known American figures. One is Mr. Kratok, former US Consul in Shanghai and Nanjing, who came to Shanghai to resume his post this time, and the other is Mr. McLane, Deputy Manager of the local Citibank, who had returned to the United States for vacation, and is now returning to Shanghai to cancel his leave. It is scheduled that there will be a total of thirty passengers leaving Shanghai on the ship today, heading to Hong Kong, India, Columbus and other ports along the way to the United States.</p>

<h3>Municipal Council States Additional Expenses Exist, But Will Manage Without Raising Any Public Debt, Refuses to Explain Source of Funds</h3>
<p>The Municipal Council has recently increased employee subsidies, and monthly expenditures have increased by 935,000 yuan. It is widely believed that the bureau will have to borrow private debt to cope with it. According to a Municipal Council spokesperson yesterday morning (12th), the bureau will be able to cope with this additional expenditure without raising any public debt. However, the spokesperson refused to explain by what means the bureau would cope with it, nor would he specify the funds that would be obtained to cope with the subsidies, whether they were foreign currency or legal tender borrowed from private parties at the stipulated exchange rate.</p>
<p>Experts Suggest Automatic Donation Increase</p>
<p>A financial expert in this city claimed that the Public Concession is currently facing a severe financial crisis, and the blame does not lie with the Municipal Council, but entirely with the taxpayers. Because after the Municipal Council sold the Electricity Department and obtained 82 million taels of silver, for several years taxpayers insisted that this money should be used first, and did not approve of increasing donations. Now that this money has been completely used up, taxpayers will have to increase donations again by at least 15% next year. If taxpayers immediately approve a continued increase in donations, the Municipal Council's financial situation will greatly improve. Taxpayers who want to take this action must convene a special meeting to automatically decide to increase municipal donations before July 1st next year, so as to avoid the Municipal Council incurring other debts again, which will make future difficulties even greater.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Merchants Going to Wenzhou and Ningbo to Procure Goods, Pay Attention to Those Carrying Tickets</h3>
<p>According to transportation circles, the Supervisory Office of the Transportation Control Bureau of the Military Affairs Commission has established an inspection station in Jinhua, Zhejiang, to implement inspections. The inspection procedures are all handled in accordance with the central regulations and laws. For passengers carrying excess legal tender, it will be handled in accordance with the Measures for Preventing the Import and Export of Special Goods Smuggled by Land, Sea and Air. The limit for passengers to carry is 500 yuan per person. If a merchant needs to transport money to a location where remittances are not possible, the amount should be more than 500 yuan and less than 1,000 yuan, and an application should be made to the Ministry of Finance for a passport. If the above procedures are not followed and the amount is found, the excess amount shall be confiscated and confiscated.</p>
<h3>Chini Canada Wheel Will Transport to Shanghai, 500,000 Pieces of Kining</h3>
<p>According to yesterday's news, 500,000 pieces of quinine (ie cinchona) from the American Red Cross transported from Java will arrive in Shanghai next week on the Zhawa Shipping Company's Chini Canada Wheel. The tablets are for use by the Shanghai Branch of the American Red Cross.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Side Levied "Special Fees", Foreign Ships Stopped Sailing the Yangtze River, Shipowners and Merchants No Longer Profitable</h3>
<p>The North-China Daily News reported that the Japanese Navy implemented a shipping ban on the coast of China in July this year, and the coastal shipping industry suffered a major blow. Only a few foreign merchants in this city still dispatched small ships to sail to the mouth of the Yangtze River and nearby ports. However, the Japanese naval authorities then levied "special fees" on small cargo ships before allowing the goods to be unloaded, resulting in a complete standstill in coastal shipping in the past few days. It is heard that the fees levied by the Japanese authorities are quite high, and the shipowners and charterers are quite disappointed, and have decided to completely suspend sailing. It is learned that foreign coastal ships, regardless of their nationality, must pay a special fee when transporting goods to Shanghai, without exception. This fee is paid by the consignor and the charterer. Recently, a certain foreign ship carrying goods arrived in Shanghai and paid a special fee of 50,000 yuan before the goods were allowed to be unloaded.</p>
<h3>British Overseas Chinese Women's Association Christmas Charity Bazaar Quick Sketch (Below)</h3>
<p>A lady in green said to me, "Sir, why don't you give it a try?"</p>
<p>I was standing in front of a table with "Can you use chopsticks?" hanging on it, watching a little girl use chopsticks to pick up small glass balls. On the table were a clock, two enamel plates, - one containing twenty glass marbles, the other empty - and a pair of vermilion chopsticks. After spending two cents, I picked up the glass marbles in the plate one by one into the empty plate, with a time limit of two minutes. The little girl was accustomed to using Chinese chopsticks, and actually picked up five in two minutes.</p>
<p>It was my turn to hold the chopsticks. I thought that I lacked experience in other matters, but I was good at using chopsticks! But the result was only two more than the little girl, which was ashamed. Just as I was about to withdraw, two Western girls came giggling, looking flamboyant. One of them picked up chopsticks and picked at the plate, and the slippery glass marbles refused to obey. The lady in green watched the clock and read, "Half a chain... one minute... one and a half minutes...". The lady next to her couldn't stand it anymore, so she simply grabbed five green onion jade fingers towards the plate, and with a clanging sound, the glass marbles fell into the porcelain plate one by one, causing everyone to laugh incessantly.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday afternoon, Lady Cole had broadcasted on the wireless phone that not only could you buy useful Christmas gifts at the venue, and use money to make useful assistance, but also you could get countless joys at the venue. Her words were indeed correct. Laughter was heard everywhere in the games room, and the children who came there refused to leave.</p>
<p>Returning to the charity bazaar again, it was already 3:30. The British ambassador's wife was leading a group of men, women, and children, singing and celebrating around the Christmas tree. Santa Claus also arrived two weeks early. When the Piaana strings were played enthusiastically, and songs and piano sounds filled the room, I was crowded in the crowd, unable to advance or retreat. I only felt that the chin and cheeks, and the hands were touching fluffy fur coats. Suddenly, I felt a little cold and wet in my wrist. I hurriedly turned my head to look. It turned out that a child was holding a popsicle in his hand and was struggling desperately to get out of the crowd. After struggling for a long time, she was still in the original position, but most of the popsicle had melted wetly.</p>
<p>Squeezing out of the venue door, two primary school students passed me by. One of them pointed to the snack stall across the street and said, "Look! Hot-dog. free!". I thought to myself that there was such a cheap thing in the charity bazaar, why was there no one in front of the stall? But after a closer look, the two primary school students were joking. The food stall clearly wrote, "Sausage sandwich one and a half yuan per guest!". It was already 3:50, and many people were waiting to go inside in the building tea suffocating. The time for the tea room to close is approximately when sandwiches are available. I was relieved.</p>
<p>Turning to the large grandstand, going downstairs to the north, the sound of people gradually thinned, and I felt a little cold on my body. The grandstand was written with: "Winning tickets are exchanged here". People who have been to the grandstand during the racing season always remember these scrums. Walking down the marble escalator from the suffocation room, and walking out of the Majun Road gate, the big clock was pointing at four o'clock. (End)</p>
<h3>Zhang Shanzi Public Memorial</h3>
<p>Held on the 15th at the Gongdelin, and an Exhibition of Zhang's Life's Works</p>

<h3>American Medical Aid to China Association, Correct the Name</h3>
<p>The American Medical Aid to China Association sent a letter to this newspaper yesterday, stating: "Dear Sir, recently, the name 'American Aid to China Association' has appeared in various newspapers, which is quite similar to the fixed Chinese name that our association has always used. I am afraid that people from all walks of life will not understand it thoroughly and will mistake the wrong thing for the right thing, which is easy to cause misunderstandings. It is verified that the official registered English name of our association is (Anetican Bureau for Medical Aidto China Ine.), and its fixed Chinese name is 'American Medical Aid to China Association'. The outside world sometimes refers to it as 'Medical Aid to China Association' or 'Aid to China Association'. This statement is specially made. I hope your newspaper will disclose it on your behalf, and please pay attention to it from all walks of life, so as to avoid confusion and show caution. This is specially requested. I wish you good writing. Sincerely, to Mr. Chief Editor of Shen Bao, Zheng Jiagu, Minister of Propaganda Department of the American Medical Aid to China Association, Qi, November 11th."</p>
<h3>National China Cotton Mill Director Kang Shoufan Abducted Yesterday – Blocked in Front of the Factory Gate and Driven North with His Car</h3>
<p>At East Youheng Road, Hongkou, at 10:30 AM yesterday, an abduction case suddenly occurred. The abducted person was Kang Shoufan, the director of the National China Cotton Mill, along with his private car. They sped towards the Hongzhen area in the Chinese district and disappeared. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Father Old, Son Becomes Factory Director</p>
<p>The National China Cotton Mill is located at 853 East Youheng Road, Hongkou, with a distribution center at 8, Lane 193, Fuzhou Road. The factory was founded by Kang Xitang (in his nineties) from Pudong. His family resides at 14, Lane 270, Jing’an Temple Road (Tongfu Lane). He has five children, one son named Shoufan, who is 25 years old. The rest are daughters; the eldest is already married. Due to recent illnesses, Xitang has entrusted all factory affairs to Shoufan. He has a small Xilimen sedan, license plate number 1666. Yesterday morning, at around 10:30, Shoufan, as usual, drove his car to the Hongkou factory for work.</p>
<p>Three Bandits Blocked the Car and Abducted Him</p>
<p>As he approached the factory gate, three bandits lying in ambush saw Kang’s car approaching and immediately blocked the road with weapons. They ordered him not to make a sound, then boarded the car in single file. One bandit sat next to Shoufan, pointing a gun at his waist, ordering him not to move. Another bandit drove, speeding along East Youheng Road, Maohai Road, and heading straight north towards the Hongzhen Xiangyan Bridge. Although the National China Cotton Mill had a security guard named Yao Miaocun (from Tongzhou, 40 years old), he did not have an official handgun. He witnessed his boss being abducted and rushed back to the factory, reporting everything to the accountant Hu Jingqing. He immediately called the Huishan Police Station, which ordered Chinese and foreign police officers to rush to the scene to investigate and strictly question the security guard about the clothing of the abductors to facilitate the pursuit.</p>
<h3>Cai Tongde Chinese Pharmacy Apprentice Tries to Harm Manager – Breaks into Bedroom at Night and Attempts Electrocution – Manager Wakes Up from Shock and Struggles to Escape</h3>
<p>As science becomes more advanced, so do criminal methods. As in the case of Zhou Qinji and Zhou Qinxiang killing Zhou Yongjie with electricity, the method used by the two sons was learned from studying radio. Recently, a similar incident occurred. The facts are recorded below. Yao Erqiang, from Ningbo, 20 years old, had been working as an apprentice at Cai Tongde Pharmacy at 455 Henan Road for three years. He usually had a good character. All the money of the store was managed by the manager and accountant, Cai Yuxiang (62 years old) from Ningbo. The safe was also placed in Cai’s room, and the key was kept in Cai’s pocket. However, Yao suddenly had bad intentions. At 3:30 AM on the 11th, Yao, with a scarf covering his face, climbed through the window into Cai’s bedroom. He had prepared an</p>
<p>electrical cord with two-pronged plugs (commonly called "puluo"). While Cai was sound asleep, he inserted one plug into a socket containing electricity, allowing electricity to flow into the cord. Then, he touched the other plug to Cai’s head. Cai woke up from the electric shock and struggled violently, grabbing Yao’s hair with one hand. Yao was also shocked by the electricity. Knowing he was in danger, he quickly pulled out the other plug, cutting off the current. Seeing that his plan had failed, Yao</p>
<p>climbed out the window and fled</p>
<p>back to his own bedroom. At that time, Cai’s head was broken by the electricity, and there was a lot of bleeding. Yao’s scarf and clothes were stained with blood, so he changed them. At dawn, Cai reported to the Central Police Station. Detective Yan Hang and officers Wang Hairu and Zhang Guanying investigated. Yao, fearing exposure, fled. The detectives first arrested his father, Yao Zuqing, and then Yao Erqiang in room 62 of the Anshang Inn at 35, Baliqiao Road in the French Concession. In his room, they found the electrical cord used for the murder and</p>
<p>a scarf and clothes stained with blood. After investigation, it was found that Yao’s motive for the murder was that Cai Tongde had more than 10,000 yuan in cash that day. Yao planned to kill Cai to steal the large sum. Cai Yuxiang’s face was injured and he was sent to the hospital for treatment. Yesterday morning, Yao was sent to the First Special Court, Criminal Division. Police lawyer Ru Baoyi explained the process, stating that the outcome of the plaintiff’s injuries was still unpredictable, so he requested permission to postpone the trial. Yao Erqiang confessed that his</p>
<p>motive for the murder was a momentary lapse of judgment. As for the reason, he planned to borrow 300-400 yuan from Cai for travel expenses to join the army in Linghua. When asked in court how he learned this method, he replied that he knew it from studying radio. Judge Xiao Xieffen reviewed the confession and ordered Yao Erqiang to be remanded in custody for another week.</p>
<h3>Consigning Two Bundles of Camel Wool – Employee Intercepts</h3>
<p>Accountant Intends to Embezzle – Manager Receives Report and Recovers</p>
<p>The Dada Camel Wool Factory at 10, Lane 367, Kang’nao Road, had two bundles of camel wool worth 1,630 yuan on the first of this month, instructed the warehouse staff to send them to Hengli Transit Company at 496 North Suzhou Road for shipment to Suzhou. However, the factory accountant Liu Changzhou and employee Li Yutang had an unusual idea. They went to Hengli Transit Company, saying that the two bundles of camel wool were the wrong color and needed to be taken back for exchange. They canceled the company’s receipt on the return slip, then hired a car, pretending to return the two bundles of camel wool to the factory. They secretly transported them to the Zhisu Inn on Tianjin Road and stored them in room 7, planning to sell them to foreign goods shops in the city for their own use. However, the accountant of Hengli Transit Company called Dada Factory to inquire. Manager Yu Jietang from Ningbo answered the phone and discovered the case. He reported it to the Gordon Road Police Station, which sent Detective Sun Shaokun to the factory. Liu and Li were arrested. After questioning, they revealed the location of the camel wool. It was immediately transported back to the factory. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Special Court. Police officer Zhang Tianyin prosecuted them for embezzlement and requested a postponement. The two defendants stammered in their confessions. Judge Jiang Shuzi ordered them to be remanded in custody for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Social News</h3>
<p>Li Chengliang from Ningbo, who works as a salesman for the Sanxing Thermos Factory at 6, 72nd Street, Alabast Road, is suspected of embezzling 2,003 yuan in goods from the Sida Foreign Company on the second of this month. He was arrested by the police after being reported by Manager Xia Tingrong. He was sent to the First Special Court yesterday and prosecuted for embezzlement. Judge Huang opened the court and ordered him to be remanded in custody pending investigation.</p>
<p>Gao Wensheng, Gao Pengshi, Song Heshi, Liu Jinhua, Zhang Zhongyu, and others from Zhenjiang, are suspected of operating a brothel at 155 Guizhou Road in partnership, forcing young girls Zhu Baolan (17 years old) and Gao Lindi (16 years old) into prostitution for profit. They were arrested by the Laozha Police Station and sent to the First Special Court, Criminal Division, yesterday morning. A request for detention was filed according to law. Judge Xiao opened the court, briefly questioned each defendant about their age and origin, and then ordered the defendants to be remanded in custody for further investigation.</p>
<p>Qingnian Wang Ziping from Changzhou, 20 years old, whose address and occupation are unknown, recently became suicidal for some unknown reason. On the night of the 10th, he went to the Dashijie Amusement Park in the French Concession alone. He bought a ticket, entered the park, and enjoyed the various shows. At 11:00, the park was closing. Wang jumped off the overpass in the large well on the third floor to commit suicide. He fell from a height, injuring his internal organs, right arm, and jaw. The park staff found him, inquired about his name, and reported it to the French Police Station, which transported him to Guangci Hospital. He died of his injuries at 6:00 AM yesterday morning.</p>
<p>Lu Xianneng from Ningbo, 25 years old, a cook at the Gongping Coffin Storage at the intersection of Xuhui West Road and Daxilu Road in the Shanghai West, was riding his bicycle east on Xiahfei Road at 2:00 PM on the fourth of this month. At the intersection of Maiqi Road, a private car number 13158, driven by Mrs. Pieres (transliteration), a British woman residing at 242 Fukaisson Road, came speeding from north to south on Maiqi Road. Lu could not avoid it, and both the person and the bicycle were knocked down and injured. He was sent to Guangci Hospital by the police. He died of his injuries at midnight on the 11th.</p>
<p>Chen Asan from Chongming, 36 years old, had an addiction to opium, which led him to extreme poverty. At 5:00 PM the day before yesterday, while passing the intersection of Maiyang Road and near Pushi Road in the French Concession, he saw a small red coffin abandoned under the bamboo fence of the vacant lot opposite number 12. Chen immediately went forward, pried open the coffin lid, took out the child’s corpse, and was stripping off the burial clothes to sell them for drug money. It happened that detectives Qin Youyu and Chen Fusheng from the French Police Station were patrolling and saw him. They arrested Chen, took him back to the police station, and investigated the case. They notified the charity and transported the child’s coffin to the coroner’s office. After taking pictures, it was transported to the burial ground for burial.</p>
<p>Mao Henian from Cixi, residing at 22 Yongfu Lane, Caishi Road, was in the file-making business. At 2:30 PM yesterday afternoon, he was repairing files at the Lao Baofeng Silver Shop at 423 Nanjing Road. When he finished his work and went downstairs, he accidentally lost his footing and fell, severely injuring his brain on the spot and barely breathing. An ambulance was immediately called and he was transported to Tongren Hospital. He died at 5:30 PM due to his injuries.</p>

<p>Wang Zhengjia from Ningbo, the director of Yihuo Hospital at 200 Alber Road in the French Concession, has a residence at 29, Lane 660, Seymour Road in the Public Concession. He has a daughter named Wenying, 21 years old, who has received secondary education and is still unmarried. However, Wenying</p>
<p>likes to wander and does not follow family teachings. Recently, she has been associating with casino employees Yu Ziren and Zhu Jinrong, frequenting gambling places, and her behavior has become increasingly unrestrained. She has successively stolen three Western suits, four silver cups, and four silver shields from her home, worth 2,000 yuan, and shared a room with Yu and others at room 401 of the Dachina Hotel on Yu Qiaqing Road,</p>
<p>spending the money extravagantly. Her father, Wang Zhengjia, found out about it. Outraged, he reported it to the Gordon Road Police Station, which sent Detective Chen Shanji to arrest Wang Wenying. Yu and Zhu are on the run. Yesterday morning, she was sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police lawyers Qian Xunjiu and Fang Fushu prosecuted her according to law and described the case. They stated that the accomplices were on the run and the stolen goods had not yet been recovered, requesting a postponement. Wang Zhengjia also filed a complaint. When questioned, Wang Wenying</p>
<p>confessed to stealing two Western suits and four silver cups, but claimed that she gave them all to Yu and Zhu and did not spend any of the money. The court ordered her to be detained for further investigation in seven days. At this point, Wang Wenying suddenly expressed remorse, shouting "Daddy, save me!" Because the case had been ordered to be postponed, she was taken back to the women's detention center by the bailiff.</p>
<h3>YMCA Daycare Center – Excellent Results from Charity Sale</h3>
<p>The YMCA held a charity sale to raise funds for opening a daycare center for working women. Major manufacturers generously donated thousands of exquisite goods, including household items, children’s toys, paintings, embroidery, medicinal herbs, and tonics. The variety was dazzling, resembling a large store. The customers who attended were also very numerous. From morning to night, it was constantly crowded, and all the goods were sold out quickly. Those who arrived later returned empty-handed. More than 7,000 yuan was raised throughout the day. The excellent results showed that people in society felt the urgent need to establish a daycare center as soon as possible. The fair in the meeting had shops such as working women, family, students, female workers, second-hand goods, etc. Other facilities such as the coffee room, game field, and children's park were all unique and attractive.</p>

<p>To the Editor, I humbly report that yesterday afternoon at about 3:00 PM, when I entered Baolong Hospital to visit a patient, I picked up a small wallet outside the gate, containing 12 yuan in cash, two pawn tickets, a laundry receipt, a watch repair shop warranty, and a pack of sewing needles. I immediately asked the people outside the door, but no one admitted to losing it. I believe it was lost by someone passing by. Now I will borrow a corner of your newspaper and ask the loser to come to my residence to claim it before 12:00 PM every morning. I would be very grateful. I wish you peace. Ren Residence, 2nd Floor, 18 Yuanchang Lane, Hualong Road, December 10th evening.</p>

<h3>Catholicism in China: An Overview of Five Major Cultural Undertakings (6) (4) The Aurora Museum</h3>
<p>The Aurora Museum, originally named the Musée Heude, was established to commemorate its founder, Father Heude. Construction began in 1867, during the reign of Emperor Tongzhi of the Qing Dynasty. Its initial location was north of the Xujiahui Observatory in Shanghai. In 1934, a new museum was built on a grand scale at the corner of Route Luthy and Route du Père Robert in the French Concession. Today, the Shanghai Municipal Museum has been destroyed. Only the Royal Asiatic Society Museum and the Aurora Museum have survived. The Royal Asiatic Society Museum is more accessible to the general public and has a less rich collection and simpler facilities compared to the Aurora Museum. Therefore, the Aurora Museum currently stands alone in Shanghai. After its foundation by Father Heude, the Aurora Museum was painstakingly managed by Fathers Le Doré, Louys, and Licent. The current director, Father P. Piel, has been tirelessly dedicated, overcoming countless difficulties to achieve the remarkable success seen today. It is no exaggeration to call it the crystallization of the efforts of these priests.</p>
<p>To collect various specimens, Father Heude traveled extensively throughout China, embarking on seven long journeys. He utilized all kinds of old-fashioned transportation, such as screw-driven boats and wheelbarrows. The museum now displays models of these modes of transportation, along with maps of Father Heude's travels, which are quite inspiring to visitors.</p>
<p>Each of the subsequent priests largely focused on one or two categories. For example, Father Le Doré specialized in collecting deer specimens, amassing 3,675 species, the most extensive collection in the Far East. Father Louys, a Doctor of Botany, largely completed the collection of grass specimens from Jiangsu Province. Father Licent, currently a professor at the University of Paris, specialized in insects and also made unique contributions. Father Zheng studied the reproductive behavior of certain insects and discovered that after the female lays eggs, the male lives alone, while the female continues to reproduce without male intervention. After 44 research studies and experiments, he created a diagram and specimen of this parthenogenetic reproduction, which is exceptionally exquisite. The priests also collaborated on the study of mollusks. In addition to jointly discovering over 700 species, Father Heude individually discovered 572 species. His writings on Chinese natural history are the most abundant.</p>
<p>The museum has three floors, each with two large halls. The ground floor is the antiquities section, displaying jade, porcelain, and bronzes from various Chinese dynasties, dating back to the Shang and Zhou Dynasties. The collection is comprehensive and includes many rare items not commonly seen elsewhere. For example, the burial garments of Chong Kai, Huang Anguo, who passed away in 1684 during the reign of Emperor Kangxi, are still intact and well-preserved. The museum acquired these items and specially made wooden figures to wear the garments for display, which is quite remarkable.</p>
<p>The first floor is the animal specimen room, divided into mammal and bird sections. The second floor houses fish, mollusk, insect, and plant specimens. The first and second floors contain 3,435 bird specimens, 6,375 animal specimens, 51,600 plant specimens, 200,000 insect specimens, 1,300 mollusk specimens, and 200,000 other specimens. There are also 2,000 to 3,000 specimens of turtles and animal skeletons, which have not yet been sorted due to the lack of dedicated personnel. In addition, there are research and testing rooms, as well as a library, all equipped with excellent facilities.</p>
<p>Before the war, the museum often received donations of hunted animals. However, there have been no new acquisitions since the war. Last year, the museum sent staff to Chahar, but they were forced to return due to the war. Fortunately, the items they had obtained were safely transported to Shanghai. According to the museum's research, there are over 100 million known insect species in the world, and an equal number of unnamed species. New animal species discovered by the museum are often sent to various countries for identification, including Berlin, Vienna, Java, Paris, and San Francisco, which have established contact with the museum. In 1935, the museum discovered 33 new insect species worldwide and 22 new species in China. The museum primarily studies Hymenoptera and Hemiptera insects, and new discoveries of these insects from around the world are sent to the museum for identification as part of academic exchange. A total of three species were identified in 1935. The museum has also created 195 original watercolor models of protozoa.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Children's Welfare Society Charity Sale of Paintings, Calligraphy, and Goods</h3>
<p>Three-Day Event Starting Today at the YMCA in Eight Immortals Bridge</p>
<p>The Shanghai Children's Welfare Institute and the Beggar Children's Education Center, located on Avenue du Lieutenant Petiot, and the newsboy schools throughout the British and French Concessions are reasonably well-established but require significant monthly expenses. This charity sale has been in preparation for over a month and has required considerable effort. Fortunately, it has received assistance from renowned calligraphers and painters such as Ma Gongyu, Wang Yachen, Shi Chongpeng, Bai Jiao, Li Qiujun, Feng Wenfeng, Chen Xiaocui, Pang Zuoyu, Zhou Lianxia, Zhong Shouzhi, Wang Shiru, and Bao Yahui, as well as major domestic goods manufacturers, making its success possible. It is scheduled to be held continuously for three days, starting today (13th), at the YMCA in Eight Immortals Bridge, from 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM each day. It is hoped that those who are passionate about protecting children will generously donate to benefit society significantly. A description of all the paintings, calligraphy, and goods is provided below:</p>
<p>(1) Collaboration Fan by Ma and Wang: The calligraphy of Ma Gongyu and the paintings of Wang Yachen are renowned throughout the country. Those who obtain them should treasure them.

<p>(3) Grand View of Western Paintings: Yan Wenliang, a veteran of Western painting, has not only generously contributed his own masterpieces but has also selected over a hundred outstanding works by teachers and students from the Suzhou Fine Arts School, showcasing the best of Western painting. This is truly remarkable.</p>
<p>(4) Assortment of Goods: The goods that companies and manufacturers have already sent include Liang Xinji's toothbrushes, which are strong and durable; cosmetics from the Family Industry Cooperative, which rival foreign products; Xiang embroidery from Sino-American, which is exquisitely crafted; toys from Wing On and Sincere; towels from Yue Chong Cheong; soap from Dah Sing Chemical Works; rattan crafts and socks from the You You Education Center; slippers and carpets from Pu Yi Crafts Cooperative; thermos bottles from Lip Hing Cheung Factory; and silk and velvet flowers from Yue Chang Kee.

<p>(5) Antiques and Ancient Paintings: The society has discreetly acquired fine porcelain, ancient bronzes, Chen inkstones, old stone seals, and paintings by Wang Shigu, Gai Qixiang, Wu Xingfen, and others from collectors. These items are full of ancient charm and are suitable for appreciation.</p>
<p>The staff of the society have been working tirelessly and diligently to organize the charity sale, and with the sincere assistance of various parties, they have achieved today's successful results, which is truly commendable.</p>

<h3>Mr. and Mrs. George</h3>
<p>— Water Log</p>
<p>"George, Miss Zhang and the others send their regards."</p>
<p>Throwing her handbag onto the small round table, she turned to take off her coat. The long rectangular dressing mirror revealed a sharp-featured woman's face: high cheekbones, slightly upturned lips, proud but slightly melancholy eyes...</p>
<p>No response. Glancing sideways in the mirror: the dim green electric light illuminated George sitting blankly on the sofa, his yellow cheeks propped in his hands, lost in thought. Her upturned lips pouted slightly.</p>
<p>Suddenly, she slithered over like a snake, sat on the arm of the sofa, and uttered a silvery voice: "Darling, what's wrong?"</p>
<p>Silence. The clock chimed eight times, precisely. Tree shadows frolicked on the pale red curtains.</p>
<p>"Nothing. Nothing." His deep eyes stared straight at the curtains, or perhaps at some distant place behind them.</p>
<p>"You're lying. I know! Is it because I've been coming home late these past few days? But it's so annoying, those people! Reading to them for free, and they still skip class, and we have to send people to visit them! The association held a big meeting for that women's night school. Miss Chen, the principal of the night school, ran over to report to us: 'The effect of the visits is unexpectedly bad: a few came, but most said they were busy and couldn't come for the time being. One simply told the visiting staff member at her home: "It's useless, I'm not going to study anymore." and went back to sticking her foil.'" Those dead people, on the first day of class they asked: 'Teacher! When will I be able to write letters?' 'I just need to be able to do accounts!'"</p>
<p>His deep eyes stared straight at the curtains, or perhaps at some distant place behind them.</p>
<p>The woman gently nudged him again, "Hey, school board member! Let me tell you another funny thing: Miss Huang told me that in one civics class, she said to those people: 'Don't spit everywhere, blow your nose into a handkerchief.' Immediately, someone stood up and asked: 'Teacher! What if I don't have a handkerchief?' Can you imagine how funny that is?... Ugh, Darling, I haven't spent time with you for days. So annoying! I say, if they don't come, let them go, honestly, we'll confiscate the one dollar deposit they each paid! Miss Zhang and the others all agreed with me, but Miss Hu didn't approve. She said: 'The key issue is that they don't have money, they're poor! Poverty is a sin, we should sympathize with them. Therefore, we can only try our best to guide them, teach them what they need most and what is easiest to accept in their living environment.' Ha! Who can't give a high-sounding speech? You go do it!... Ugh, enough! Wait a while, after dinner, I'll take you to the movies."</p>
<p>The sound of leather shoes "clack-clacking" came from the doorway. "Mom! Mom!"</p>
<p>"What's wrong? Oh dear! So much sweat! How did you get so dirty?" Old Tang, who was walking behind, explained breathlessly.</p>
<p>"Young Master wants to eat, I said Shao Nai didn't order it, so of course I can't serve him. Young Master then—"</p>
<p>"Of course?" Her upper lip curled. "Old Tang, I'm telling you: if your child is sick, you can find a replacement worker, it's not right to be so muddleheaded. Look, what have you done to your clothes? You can't blame me—"</p>
<p>Suddenly, "ding-ding-ding"—the telephone on the lampstand rang!</p>
<p>"Hello!... Who is it? Oh, Miss Zhang! Yes!... Nothing much!... Okay. I'll be right there!" She hung up the phone. "Miss Zhang wants me to go play mahjong right away. Miss Huang and Miss Chen too, three are short one, I can't refuse!"</p>
<p>She hurriedly put on her coat. Opening her handbag, she took out something and, facing the small mirror on the handbag, dabbed it on her face, eyebrows, and lips. Seeing Old Tang still standing beside her, she said: "Why haven't you served the meal yet?"</p>
<p>"I—I wanted to borrow a few dollars from Shao Nai!"</p>
<p>"What? You know I'm going to play mahjong and you're asking me for money?" She loudly snapped her handbag shut and ran to the door. "Goodbye, Darling! Goodbye, Sonnie! Oh, I can't take you to the movies tonight again, so annoying!"</p>
<p>The door "slammed" shut.</p>
<p>"Mom! Mom!" George listlessly raised his head. "Johny, come here to Daddy. Come!" Seeing that John didn't move, he could only "act as both father and mother"...</p>
<p>Old Tang shook her head and sighed.</p>
<h3>Watching</h3>
<p>— Sanren, Painting by Gou Sheng</p>
<p>Someone was absentmindedly gazing at the sky, and the person behind him came up to him. Then, passersby also stopped, and gradually a large crowd of people were watching the sky. What are they looking at? No one knows.</p>
<p>"Accusing the Heavens" - what's so interesting about that? Yet a large crowd of people gathered around. "Do a good deed," but no one contributes a penny. In short, you watch, I watch, everyone watches.</p>
<p>"A Fire" is naturally even more interesting to watch, but people don't have the courage to get too close. It's best if the fire burns as brightly as possible, and one can stand as far away as possible, which is called "watching a fire from across the river," how carefree!</p>
<p>This is still just "watching." There are also those who want to take advantage of the situation, or even say they are trying to "rob a burning house." Let me give an example. Ah, I have one. Everyone probably remembers the grand spectacle of the coronation of the English king. The police whips fell on the people in the front row, and the people behind them created an unprecedented page of "social news"!</p>
<p>You watch, I watch, everyone watches, but no one watches with a long-term perspective.</p>
<h3>Life</h3>
<p>— Guangli</p>
<p>Wang Niu (Wang Cow) was born in the year of the "Ox." He has a blind mother, and he needs to keep her alive, so he asked someone to recommend him to work in a factory. Every day, before dawn, he gets up and goes to work. When he arrives at the factory, he buries himself in the machine room and works hard, even though it is still dark.</p>
<p>Mr. Li, I forget how old he is this year, but anyway, he was born in the year of the "Dog." He has a wife and a son, and he needs to keep his whole family alive, so he took the exam to become a clerk in the factory. Every day, he gets up at seven o'clock, takes the streetcar, and rushes to the office, where he starts work at eight o'clock.</p>
<p>Old Zhao is said to have been born in the year of the "Tiger." He has a wife and another concubine. He is the director of this factory. Every day, he gets up at ten o'clock, takes his private car, and goes straight to the factory. In the director's office, he drinks tea and eats breakfast, then picks up a newspaper and reads the day's news.</p>
<p>Manager Zhang was born in the year of the "Dragon." He has one wife and two concubines. Prospective dancing girls are not included. He gets up around eleven o'clock every day. After saying goodbye to his wives, he gets in his car and speeds to the factory. He steps into the manager's office, as usual makes a few phone calls, and purchases theater tickets or inquires after the dancing girls - just "official business."</p>
<p>At two o'clock in the afternoon, Manager Zhang leaves in his car.</p>
<p>At four o'clock in the afternoon, Director Zhao leaves in his private car and does not return.</p>
<p>At six o'clock in the evening, the clerks get out!</p>
<p>At eight o'clock in the evening, the big gate is opened and dozens of workers are released.</p>
<p>The god of sleep is equal to all:</p>
<p>Wang Niu has his blind mother by his side.</p>
<p>Mr. Li has a wife and son to keep him company.</p>
<p>Director Zhao has his wives on both sides protecting him.</p>
<p>Manager Zhang has one wife and two concubines surrounding him, so he is not only unlikely to get cold, but when he can't sleep in the middle of the night, he can get up and play another four rounds of mahjong.</p>

<h3>Willow in Zhangtai</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>On the Qingming Festival, spring returns to the earth, the green waves on the river are clear and rippling. Zhang Tianru was very happy and wanted to take the Liu sisters on a boat trip to Qingxi and visit Jingyuan to see Ni Nanyun. Liu Ru Shi could not refuse her teacher's kindness, so she went on the trip with Zhang Tianru. When they arrived at Jingyuan, it so happened that Ni Nanyun had gone to Suzhou. The host was not there and was entertained by the servants. Zhang Tianru could not help but feel disappointed, so he had to walk around the garden. Liu Ru Shi was concerned about the drunken man in the boat, and repeatedly urged Zhang Tianru to return to the boat. Zhang Tianru then gave money to the servants and walked back to the boat with the Liu sisters. They saw that Shi Da was still sitting in the cabin, eating in a mess. Aunt Xu whispered in Liu Ru Shi's ear, "You went to the garden by yourselves, but left a strangely shaped beggar drinking in the boat. One pot after another, his belly seems to be connected to the sea, he has drunk at least eight or nine pounds of wine. The dishes are all eaten, but he asked us for peanuts to drink with the wine, and he has already eaten a pound of peanuts. He refuses to leave, what are you keeping him for? I have never seen such charity to a beggar." Liu Ru Shi smiled slightly, called out "Mother," waved her hand and said, "This beggar is different from the others, mother, don't grumble, we will send him away." Liu Ru Shi finished speaking and walked into the middle cabin with Zhang Tianru and Jiangzi. When Shi Da saw them coming back, he put down his wine glass and cupped his hands to them, saying, "Are you back? Thank you for inviting me to drink. I have been rude and drunk a lot, and I dare not disturb you any more. I am very grateful for your kindness, and I will repay you if I have the opportunity in the future. I am originally from Hebei, and I have been wandering around the world for ten years. I have been busy with the wind and dust, and it is difficult to find a confidant. People treat me like a beggar. I think that now, in general, princes and adults are unscrupulous and shameless, and they are just begging for wealth, so it is better to honestly beg. Although I would like to tell you about my life experience, there is no way to start. When I was young, I used to be with Robber Zhi, but I have long repented and put down the butcher's knife, so I have become penniless. I hope you won't laugh at me." After speaking, he put the remaining wine in the pot to his mouth and drank it all up. He smacked his lips and said, "Good wine, good wine, I haven't had such good wine for a long time." Just as Zhang Tianru and Liu Ru Shi were about to speak, Shi Da suddenly put down the wine pot, wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, said "excuse me," cupped his hands to them again, strode out of the cabin, and with a light leap, he reached the shore. He took a big step and ran eastward as if flying. In the blink of an eye, his burly back was gone. Liu Ru Shi watched him leave, and could not help but sigh, "In ancient times there were yellow-shirted, curly-bearded people, this person is a similar type, which is endearing." Zhang Tianru also said, "What a heroic man! It's a pity that he didn't get his chance." At this time, the sun had set in the west, and the waves reflected the sunlight, making it golden yellow. The evening breeze brushed their sleeves, and they still felt the chill of spring. The group returned home in the shadow of the setting sun. (8)</p>

<h3>Outstanding Amongst the Four Great Young Female Dan Performers, Li Shifang Will Reappear on Stage</h3>
<p>— Zhiwen</p>
<p>Zhang Junqiu Decides to Give Up Forming a Troupe, The Authenticity of Wanli's Recognition of His Son Is Uncertain</p>
<p>(Beijing Correspondence) Apart from Li Shifang, the other four great young female Dan performers in the former capital, such as Zhang Junqiu, Song Dezhu, and Mao Shilai, have all shown considerable talent. Before the "July 7th" Incident, Shifang was the most active figure among the child actors. After being selected by the Liyan Daily as a top-ranked actor, his reputation increased tenfold. At that time, Zhang Junqiu, who was performing with Lei Xifu, was still unknown. Song Dezhu only performed martial Dan roles in drama school. Although she occasionally performed Hua Dan roles, her skills were mediocre. Mao Shilai's performance of Hua Dan and martial roles was quite impressive, but his position was inferior to that of Li Shifang. In the Fu Society's unique plays such as "The Drunken Beggar" and "Jin Ping Mei," Shifang played the main role, while Shilai was in a supporting role. When Shifang was on the rise, his voice unfortunately changed and he could no longer sing, which was a big blow to him. In the past three years, he has spent a lot of effort on treating and conditioning his voice. He went to Peking Union Medical College Hospital and also consulted famous doctors. At the same time, he practiced martial arts every day. This was all in an attempt to return to the stage. Now, Zhang, Song, and Mao are known both north and south, while Shifang has gradually been forgotten. Whenever he thinks of this, he works even harder to hone his skills, hoping to compete with them in the future.</p>
<p>Heaven does not disappoint those who work hard. Shifang did not waste his efforts, and his voice finally came back. His father and friends were so happy. Under the urging of various parties, Shifang finally formed a troupe after two months of preparation. However, regarding the roles, in order to strengthen the lineup, there were repeated changes. The old male role was originally set to be Guan Chengxi, but now it has been replaced by Chen Shaolin; the martial role Yang Shengchun replaced Gao Shenglin, and the painted face role is still the old partner Yuan Shihai. When they were in the Fu Society, every performance of "Farewell My Concubine" was a full house. Shifang's Yu Ji and Shihai's Overlord were evenly matched, and their singing and acting were excellent. After Shihai graduated, the Overlord was played by Ye Shengmao, which was not as good. As for the young male role, it is played by Jiang Miaoxiang. In addition to "Jin Ping Mei" and "The Legend of the Kunlun Swordsman," Shifang's plays are all based on Wan Hua. Miaoxiang is Wan Hua's hard match, and Shifang's invitation to him to participate allows him to learn at any time, which is naturally very beneficial. The clowns are Sun Shengwu and Ai Shiju, who are also up-and-coming stars. The original manager was Yuan Shihai, but he is currently staying in Shanghai and it is not known when he will be back, so Shifang has temporarily hired Li Huating, a star from the Tianjin China Theatre, to serve as manager. The troupe is named "Chengfang Society," and Shifang is the president. The date of the performance has been set for New Year's Day next year. Now, various theaters are vying to invite them.</p>
<p>Since Zhang Junqiu's marriage, in view of Li Shifang's formation of a troupe, he also had the intention of taking on a major role alone. However, when he thought of Song Dezhu's words "I've had enough of forming a troupe," he couldn't help but feel discouraged. Forming a troupe is not an easy task. Finding the right actors is difficult, but dealing with all kinds of troublesome affairs is even more headache-inducing. Moreover, Ma Lianliang is very good to him, and he is embarrassed to leave. In Tianjin, the voice of Junqiu forming a troupe is getting louder and louder. The Grand View Garden Theater sent someone to Ping to invite him to perform, but he politely declined. According to his statement, he has now given up the idea of forming a troupe and will continue to perform with Lianliang's "Fufeng Society" because he is not sure that he can make money by forming his own troupe.</p>
<p>In addition, there is another event that has caused a sensation in the Pingjin drama scene, which is "Zhang Junqiu does not recognize his biological father." Before and after Junqiu's marriage, an old man came to the former capital from Shanghai, claiming to be Junqiu's biological father. It is said that Junqiu's father saw through the world when Junqiu was very young and went into the deep mountains (in Zhejiang). Now that Junqiu is enjoying a great reputation in the drama scene, and also because he misses his son, he went from Shanghai to Ping to request adoption. Junqiu thought that this old man came suddenly and there was no evidence, so he offered to pay 400 yuan to settle this dispute, but his father refused. Another version is that his father served as a section chief somewhere during the Zhili-Anhui warlord era, and was later arrested for something. It was not until the Northern Expeditionary Army arrived in Tianjin that he was released. When he returned home, his nest had been occupied, and with anger, he went to Chun Shen. As for whether these two legends are true, outsiders have no way to prove it. However, we hope that this entanglement can be resolved reasonably and fairly. (Sent on November 8th)</p>
<h3>Bai Yang, Gu Eryi and Others Actively on Stage: Song Zhi's New Work "Punishment" to be Performed in Chongqing</h3>
<p>(Chongqing Dispatch) The China Electric Drama Troupe was established a year ago, and "Combat" was their debut performance. Following that, they assisted various drama troupes with indirect work and initiated numerous rural drama movements. Last winter, while accompanying the "China Electric" "Ten Thousand Miles of Azure Sky" location shooting team to Yunnan to film outdoor scenes, they performed plays such as "Dancing Demons" and "Frontier Storm" in Kunming. After returning to Chongqing this spring, they focused on completing various documentary films for "China Electric" itself, as well as the interior scenes for "Ten Thousand Miles of Azure Sky," which were urgently needed. Furthermore, they had lost their performance venues due to repeated bombings, resulting in a period of silence for more than half a year.</p>
<p>Recently, to launch the winter drama movement and to respond to the Central Party Headquarters' donation efforts for orphans, they selected Song Zhi's "Punishment," Zhang Min's "Night," and Ge Yihong's "Red Tassel Spear" in the initial preparatory meeting. These three plays will be performed separately in the short term, with "Punishment" as the premiere performance. The central theme of "Punishment" addresses the most serious current issues of rice and grain, and conscription. It will be directed by Zhang Min. The selection of the performance committee members and the allocation of actors have been finalized. The venue has been decided to be at the "Cathay," with the date set for December 20th.</p>
<p>As for the plays "Night" and "Red Tassel Spear," it has been decided that Shen Xiling and Sun Shiyi will be the directors, and they are also in the planning stage.</p>
<p>The "Punishment" performance committee consists of thirteen members: Luo Xuelian, Bai Yang, Shen Xiling, Yu Zhongying, Xu Suling, Xu Angqian, Shi Chao, Gao Zhanfei, Sun Yu, Qiu Yiwei, Pan Zinong, Wei Heling, Gu Eryi, and others.</p>
<p>The main actors are Shi Chao (Shi Jingyun), Wen Rong (Li Buleng), Bai Yang (Gu Yujin), Sha Meng (Wei Dacheng), Bai Yun (Old Woman), Gu Eryi (Gu Rongxuan), and others.</p>
