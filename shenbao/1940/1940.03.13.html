<h3>蔣委員長朂全國國民　厲行精神總動員綱領　務在切實兩字上面痛下磨聯工夫　提倡工作競賽增加生產完成建設　充實國民月會藉以策進戰時生活　勝利光明已在目前</h3>
<p>重慶　十二日爲國民精神動員運動一週年紀念、蔣會長於晚七時廣播講演、略謂、今天是總理逝世十五周年紀念日、我在去年今日、向全國同胞宣布國民精神總動員綱領、並告全國軍民（以實行精神總動員對我們總理作具體的紀念）、我更勉勵同胞、要表裏貫澈、切勿視此舉爲尋常、要以精神的改進、見之於實際的行爲、來完成我們抗戰建國的大業、自從這一個綱領頒布以後、於今整整一年了、這一年中間、抗戰工作的進行、雖然很艱苦、國際風雲的變化、雖然很曼衍、但是我全國軍民都能够定如山岳、動若雷霆、共同一致、堅忍奮鬥卒使日人在軍事上受到我們迎頭痛擊、他政治上一切詭詐陰險的策略、都無法僥倖、這過去一年之中、實在是定了我們最後勝利的基礎、亦就是他們已受到我們致命的打擊、造成他決定的失敗、我們全綫將士、捨命犧牲、海內外同胞輸財輸力、熱烈從公、淪陷區的同胞、不僅努力禦奸、還能輸財報國、至於傷愈將士、重上戰塲、適齡壯丁、爭先入伍、以及戰地民衆、協助軍隊的踴躍、生產分子努力建設、無論在地區的分佈上、在數量的計劃上、都比以前加倍的增加、外國的觀察家、凡是親到中國來視察的、咸承認中國有不可侵侮的力量、有戰勝的把握、而他們這個綜論的根據、就是中國的國民、覺察到中國國民精神、花兩年半抗戰中、已獲得更堅毅的進步了、在今日舉行精神總動員紀念的時候、我不能否認我的精神總動員已有了相當的收穫、我不能不對各地熱心宜傳精神總動員、和實行精神總動員的同胞、表示我的感慰、但是知道精神總動員、不僅是一種教育啟發的工作、而是要普遍實行的工作、精神總動員的功用、不僅是要振作我們的精神、來求得抗戰的勝利、而且要在此戰時、相互奮勉、加緊奮鬥、造成一種奮發精進向上的新風氣、使我們建國必須的一切建設、很迅速的完成、所以我們自不能以目前少數的成績、引爲自滿、反之、我們必須嚴格檢討、不斷策勉、來擴大我們已得的成績、改正我們當前的缺點、大家一定還記得精神總動員綱領結論中、特別提出的三點、（一）就是要澈底、（二）就楚要持久、（三）就是要堅忍、現在我們如果忠實的檢査一下、就知道精神總動員的實行、還沒有做到這三個要點、什麽叫做澈底呢、澈底就是要澈裏澈外的去實做、對於綱領所指示的、國民公約所規定的、都要全部的接受、全部的實行、不能取共一部而忽略他的另一部、也不能祗做到消極的條件、而不執行積極的條件、什麽叫做持久呢、就是要繼續不斷的苦做、旣不能一暴十寒、也不可有始無終、譬如　　我們國民月會、一個月舉行一次、如果祗有舉行月會這一天是緊張的、就決不能收到如何的功效、什麼是堅忍呢、就是要堅忍不拔貞固不移、我們今天在全力抗戰、戰時的艱難、本是與日俱增的、且愈接近勝利和成功、我們的困苦艱難、必愈加深刻、如果我們祗能批抗平常的艱難、而不能受非常的困苦、經不起壓迫、受不住煎熬、那麽任憑如何慷慨激昂、也不能算是實行精神總動員、現在我們國民愛國心很旺盛、民族大義的認識很普遍、抗戰的信念很堅强、但是上面這三個總點能够完全做到的、實在是沒有多少人、我細察其原因、實在由於我們國民還不能改革我們多少年來的一個最大缺點、就是所謂不切實、我認爲現代國家最値得我們效法的一種德性、就是「切實、」他們硏究、就是切切實實的認眞去研究、學習亦是切切實實的認眞去學習、工作是認眞的工作、服務是認眞的服務、隨時隨地都充滿了絲毫不苟的精神、所以態度總是積極的、作事總是切實的、我們的先民、也何嘗不如此、所謂實事求是、精益求精、就是這種精神的說明、但是我們現在一般情形怎麼樣、我們接受一個理想很隨便、承諾一個的言很容易可是實行起來、總是苟且敷衍、前人所說的（念茲在茲）的風氣、在我們國民中間、現在是很少見的、試問我們在抗戰建國過程中、人民是負有公務責任的、負有敎育宣傳責任的、負有基層工作責任的、以至於一般民衆本來各有各人跋肅的任務、可是能「心在事上」的、究竟有多少人、能不苟且、不粉飾、不間斷、而認認眞眞切實幹到底的有多少人、這種風氣、如果任他瀰漫下去、我們儘管有很好的辦法、儘管有一部份很忠勇奮發的將士和人民、我們所要達到的使命、決不能全部完成、道種風氣、在平時已經應該矯正、在戰時尤其應該改革、如果我們在這個生死存亡關頭的戰時、還不能養成（切實）的風氣、一切的工作、還是不負責任、這就無異於大家以個人的生死和種族的存亡、當作一件兒戲、這樣國家民族的前途、豈不是異常危險、所以我在今天精神總動員的紀念日，要求我們同胞、務必在（切實）兩字上面、痛下一番磨鍊洗刷的工夫、我們以後推行精神總動員、就要從此處下手、我以爲要（崇實去僞、）養成普遍認眞的風氣、決不是困難的事情、我們只要痛切改革過去多少年來好高鶩述積重難返的習氣、要使宜傳不是空泛的、計劃不是寬廓的、一切工作不是脫離實際的、這樣就必能持久、必能澈底、必能堅忍、就必能實做、必能苦做、必能硬做、使我們一切的努力、都發生最大的力量、今後我們要振作國民的精神　　、先要做到整飭國民的精神、要普及國民精神總動員、先要使已經宣誓國民公的的同胞、切切實實做到誓言裏所舉的很簡單的十二條款、同時我們要創造新風氣、先要鼓舞起新的原動力、要完成大事業、先要號召我們同胞、從接近平易的具體事項做起、我本着這幾個要點、特地爲我們同胞講明上面幾件事、作爲我們目前推行精神總動員的方針、作爲我們努力普遍精神總動員的參考、第上、要實行綱領、我們去年宣布的精神總動員綱領裏面、有五大要項、本來規定有實施的事項、現在我們更要進一步的使他成爲簡單具體的事項、使精神總動員的意義、都能從實際工作中表現出來、例如我們要改正醉生夢死的生活、首先就要禁絕烟毒和賭博、取締奢靡、提倡簡單樸素、實行節約和儲蓄、我們要養成奮發蓬勃的朝氣、就首先要注意整齊淸潔、提倡體育衛生、策進國民強健的體魄、我們要打破苟且偷生的習慣、就先要厲行工作考査、注重確實迅速、提倡積極奮發、以不忠職守爲莫大的恥辱、以踴躍服役爲莫大的光榮、我們要打破自私自利的企圖、那就要肅淸貪汚欺僞的惡風、戒除囤積居奇的罪惡、要實現意志集中力量集中的信條、養成現代國民的人格、我們要糾正紛岐錯雜的思想、就先要實踐國家至上民族至上的誓約、提倡奉行法令嚴守紀律的習慣、要互相督察、互相勸勉、使一般國民尊重戰時國民的責任、視戰時政令的尊嚴、同於軍中的軍令、共同一致、達成軍事第一勝利第一的目標、我們同胞能首先做到這幾點、就達到了我們精神總動員大部分的要求、第二、要加强經濟鬥爭、以打破日人最大的陰謀、日人現在軍事侵略力量日衰、政治陰謀早已失敗、他還在猛力進行的、就是經濟的榨取、就是對我們國家各種經濟的掠奪和毀壞、更是對我們淪陷區內同胞的壓迫和欺詐、關於這一點、我們全國同胞、必須特別警覺、必須全國一致、不分男女老少、都要努力破壞劣貨的運送、檢舉走私、抵制販賣、我更希望戰地同胞們、特別要實踐國民公約你們對於國民公約、如能貫澈一分、那你們解放的日期就可提早一天、大家務必要互相激勉、不論在任何情形之下、絕不妥協、國民公約中四條、尤爲重要、道四條就是制人死命的最大武器、須知我們多買人一寸火柴、多用人一張僞鈔、就是帮助人多殺我們一個同胞、多佔我們一塊國土、成仁取義、威武不屈、就要在這點上表現我們民族的精神、第二、要提倡工作競賽、來增加生產，完成建設、抗戰到了今天、已不完全是軍事問題、而眞正建國工作、就要從現在開始、所以我們必須鼓勵前進的勇氣、將　　我們全國同胞的精力、提高到最高限度、來增進我們的工作效率、我們不論是作戰、是行政、是從事敎育訓練、是努力生產建設、也不論是戰區、是後方、所有中央地方縣區鄕村機關學校工廠農塲、都要厲行工作競賽、規定競賽標準約定競賽單位、看誰做得多、誰做得好、誰做得快、誰做得確實、誰的物美、誰的價廉、誰浪費最少誰出品最精、乃至誰節約、誰儉樸、誰淸潔、誰整齊、誰最有紀律、誰最能互助、如此不斷的競賽、不斷的研究、有缺點、互相幫助改正、有長處、互相觀摩發揚、一方面將我們個人工作的興趣、盡量提高、同時更使我們集體工作的共同成績、一天天的改良進步、這樣不僅戰時力量、因而充實、而因循愆慢的習氣、也必能因此革除、第四、要充實國民月會、使大家踴躍參加、更有意義、國民月會的舉行、必須普遍推廣、但國民月會的內容、更須加以充實、我們要以國民月會來策進戰時生活、同時也要以國民月會來積極的訓練民衆、組織民衆、要使國民月會成爲喚起民衆奮鬥、提倡民衆互助、革除不良風習、訓練自治精神、促進生產事業、的上種集會、政府現在上方面厲行建設、上面正要施行新縣制、建立地方自治、所以我們要使國民月會與地方自治的工作、打成一片、要盡量策動與會同胞、報吿當地經過的事項、討論實際改進的問題、成爲推進各種建設的一種有效的組織、而不是一種奉行故事的儀式、這是各地領導月會的同胞所應該多方注意善爲運用的、上面所舉的幾項、都是根據一年以來的經騐和觀察、爲要鼓勵我們國民志趣、振奮我們國民精神、而指小我們同胞以切要易行的辦法、最後我要吿訴全國同胞、今天整個抗戰形勢、和整個世界大局、都要個否極泰來的時期、勝利光明已在我們的前面、但我們更應堅忍、更應奮發、決不可有絲毫空隙、絲毫懈怠、使日人有懈可擊、有隙可乘、我們必須樹立森嚴的精神壁壘、磨礪我們堅銳的精神武器、紮硬寨、打死仗、流血汗、衝前鋒、一切有利於日有害於國的事、決不可作、一切有利國家有助抗戰軍事的工作、必須努力去做、大家要痛念總理逝世　經十五年了、我們革命、還沒有成功、日人還竊佔我們的國土、我們應該是如何的悲憤和慚愧、但是想到總理的三民主義、巳領導我們走上光明勝利之路、我們又是如何的奮興、在今天精神總動員一週年的時候、正是我們檢點自己策勉自己的時候、我究竟對國家盡了多少的責任、我的精神和生活、是不是適合於戰時國民的精神和生活、望大家人人反省、及時改正、及時振作、明禮義、知廉恥、負責任、守紀律、　　竭忠盡智、努力向前、負起總理所遺留給我們的革命建國求得中國自由平等的莊嚴使命、（　二日電）</p>

<h3>芬蘭與蘇聯談判之關鍵</h3>
<p>昨晨盛傳，芬蘭與蘇聯兩國間之和平談判，將於昨日揭曉。竊以萬分誠悃，祝以圓滿解決。顧乃迄午夜記者握管時止，尙無好消息。差可告慰者，雙方談判仍繼續進行，成敗之數，半與半焉。</p>
<p>芬蘭蘇聯之和或戰，係兩國間事，然所影響於國際現狀與前途者，遠大微妙之甚。賅括言之：任何他國，一體視芬蘇和戰與痛癢相關。分析言之：英法願芬蘭堅强抗戰，否則，亦必不犧牲，不讓步，獲得光榮之和平：德國願蘇聯速戰速勝，否則，亦望蘇聯雖僅小有所獲，早日相與息戰言和；義大利所願，類乎英法；日本願蘇聯儘戰，而消耗至於無量；美國與中國，願芬蘇間成立光榮公道之和平。如此分析，殆爲英法德義日所不願首肯，但我人純以客觀觀察，分析所得之印象若此。英法德義日對芬蘭，絕無惡意，但各爲本國計，所願芬蘇問題今後之趨歸若此。</p>
<p>芬蘇正在談判之中，謂爲成敗各半，跡近模稜兩可；顧在談判內容未明瞭。談判結果未確定之際，孰得而預言之？抑和戰關鍵安在乎？世之論者，或謂芬蘭和戰視英法實際援助之何似，或謂英法援助視瑞典挪威所予方便之何似，或謂視芬蘭陸軍總司令馬納漢上將對於戰局前途把握與態度之何似乎耳。論者各有所據。竊就中日問題體騐所得，就芬蘇問題而體認之。輒覺世論云云，有所未安。世論之於中國抗戰：其敵視中國者，謂中國抗戰由英美之援助：其中傷中國者，謂中國抗戰由共產黨之挾持；善意而隔閡者，謂中國抗戰由蔣介石上將軍之主張；皆非也。由日本侵略，由中華整個國族之求生存，由中國潛力之能持續持久抗戰，由爭取最後勝利之自信。以此論之於芬蘇和議：芬蘭朝野，芬蘭軍民，其忠勇等於中國；所惜天賦之不厚，故客觀條件上，不能作持續持久之抗戰：主觀意識上，遂昌言待援，而無自力爭取最後勝利之自信；以馬納漢上將之忠貞智勇，亦僅謂不克保持國族之獨立自由，寗戰至一老一婦一豎；限之，無可奈何，非人謀之不臧也。抑和戰關鍵安在乎？曰在蘇聯。</p>
<p>蘇聯國族，有其不可反之異禀者也。能恣爲，顧有所不爲。有所信，顧亦能審時度勢，捐棄所不必要之執持。事例夥矣，未遑爲之多所說明，即就對芬蘭而論：在軍事上，冒天時地利之艱阻，作深入摧堅之嘗試。遭遇抗戰，鋒銳屢挫，淺薄者譏以穉弱，其　擁有絕對優勢，蓋識者共認也；誠使恣其雄偉之力量，終必控制芬蘭全境；即使必無幸；今乃不執持其軍事上之勝利而發動和議。是非示必無幸：今乃不執持其軍事上之勝利而發動和議，是非不弱，故不失其光榮者也。在政治上，最初殆以迷惘而自陷於虛誇之宣傳，殆爲投靠之同志所欺罔，以爲一夫發難，廣爲號召，可得而易幟也；爾後明知其未然，亦豈不得以軍力爲後盾而扶掖之，而成全之，假以名義，視爲工具，今日能置能賤，他日予求予取可耳；顧乃今茲發動和議而仍以芬蘭現政府爲對手，未嘗以此轉變爲有損於所謂體面也者，此無他，能發能收，不尼不滯，蘇聯有立國之自信，操政策以自動，知所謂體面與否之根本不在乎此，自不妨捐棄傀儡而無礙其體面者也。惟蘇聯若此，故問題乃在蘇聯將不計時日，不計犧牲，卒以軍力滅亡芬蘭乎？抑將提示芬蘭所可接受之條件，俾芬蘭依然爲獨立自由之國家，自此化干戈爲玉帛。和平於是實現乎？芬蘭對於領土問題，必準備適應蘇聯意願，無礙本國生存，而作相當讓步；對於主權問題，必來疆域之內，獨立自由之完整而絕不苟且。蓋立國以主權完整爲絕對條件，而領土廣窄爲相對現象；忠貞謀國者，上之謀萬全，次之寗讓局部領土而絲毫無讓於主權。讓主權則不國；蓄意滅人國者，務以暴力控制全局，不得已而求其次，則謀控制主權而曰無求於領土。總之：芬蘇談判內容不可知，前途成敗不可知：所可推想知之者：芬蘭是否接受蘇聯條件之標準極簡單，端視其割地是否無礙生存？獨立自由是否保全而已。所不可知者：蘇聯條件如何？故曰關鍵在蘇聯。芬蘇談判成敗，兩國和戰之關鍵也；兩國和戰，歐亂擴大與否之關鍵也，世界大局漸趨安定抑愈趨險惡之關鍵也。規模的軍事侵略、我們爲求生存、才被迫而抗戰、所以侵略一天不止、我們的抗戰也就一天不止、這當中沒有絲毫徘徊的餘地、總之、我們總理的一生、乃爲求國家的自由平等而奮鬥、所以我們國家的獨立與自由、一天不能獲到我們就要繼續奮鬥、且當前我們的抗戰、就是繼承總理的遺志、完成國家獨立與自由的大業、因此只有抗戰到底、才算是總理的信徒、也才算盡了今後我們紀念總理的意義、我們的抗戰、快滿　　二年了、他人愈戰愈弱、我們則愈戰愈强、他們的軍事攻勢、由最近一年的戰鬥情形看來、已是毫無辦法、現在就只有加緊政治攻勢、從事製造傀儡組織、以欺騙他們的國人、可是事實上除了少數甘心受其驅使外、相信我全國忠勇軍民、一定都能洞燭其奸謀詭計、加强團結、一致粉碎他們的野心、爭取最後勝利、所以他們這一種企圖、只反映他的無辦法、絕對於我無損、今天我們在此紀念總理、恰好又是國民精神總動員的一週年紀念、總理的全部遺敎、是我們抗戰建國的最高指導原則、而國民精神總動員綱領當中所規定的、又是根據總理的遺敎、完成抗戰建國的重要事件、我們爲爭取最後勝利、除了恪遵幷貫澈總理遺敎外、對於精神總動員綱領、更要躬行實踐、特別是對於綱領上的三個目標、要切實做到、因爲這三個目標、可以說是我們今後一切努力的最高原則、能够把這三個量高原則加以貫澈、不但最後的勝利可操、幷且建國復興的大業、也可以加速的完成、（十二日電）</p>

<p>倫敦　關於蘇聯芬蘭兩國所進行之和議、此間金融界人士咸謂、芬蘭在若干小時之內、未必作何決定、緣蘇聯所提條件、須首先由芬蘭內閣決定接受後、再由國會加以核准、始能認爲已由芬蘭全民族所接受、又該國陸軍總司令孟納興上將、對於該國能否賡續抵抗、知之最諗、此公意見如何、亦有舉足重輕之力量云、（十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>巴黎　此間外交界人士頃談稱、蘇聯政府向芬蘭所提出之和平條件、似已切實予以减低、窺其用意、殆欲儘速與該國成立協定、其理由有下、（上）列寗城距離戰區甚近、該城一帶居民、對於戰事形勢、知之甚諗、恐未必能長此保持旺盛之民氣、（二）英法兩國實有積極干涉芬蘇戰事之可能、觀於英國首相張伯倫本日在下議院宣稱、芬蘭倘若提出申請英法兩國即當不顧他國態度如何、繼續加以援助、即其明證、不寗唯是、蘇聯自對芬蘭用兵以還、迄未能以迅疾手段取獲勝利、是以對於德國所處地位、業已大見削弱、而又爲挽救其技術的工業的資源起見、不得不與德國簽訂合作協定授權該國組縱與統制蘇聯生產事業、實則蘇聯當局、未必歡迎此一協定、迅即見諸事實、加之德國在去年九十月間雖已自動放棄其在波羅的海沿岸各國所保有之地位、但最近鑒於紅軍隊之久戰無功、又欲設法予以恢復蘇聯駐英大使邁斯基最近曾向英國外務部當局進行接洽、期望英國調處芬蘇兩國戰事、此舉實具有極大意義一、蓋即此一端、足見蘇聯因深恐償付過高之代價、不願籲請德國出而調處、此在政界人士亦謂、觀於本日所傳蘇聯對芬條件、遠較戰事爆發以前所提出者爲緩和、該國之欲迅速成立和議、實已顯而易見、</p>
<p>按諸斯堪的那維亞半島各國傳來消息蘇聯已不復堅持由芬蘭割讓維堡港、而僅要求由雙方劃定新界綫質言之、即將界綫自拉多加湖、經由孟納興防綫展至伏奧克森城、然後循紅軍目前所佔據之綫、直達芬蘭蘇瑪城與維堡港間之一點、似此、孟納興防綫之一部份仍可爲芬蘭所有、此外、蘇聯對於芬蘭北部只柴摩港與南部漢戈半島兩處之要求、聞亦已較前緩和云、（十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>香港僑校藉口遵行新例　已紛紛增收學費　現增高白分之二十為最普通　貧苦學生難以應付被迫退學</h3>
<p>（香港通訊）此間華僑學校因港府頒行敎育新例、碍難遵辦者殊多、日前聯合請求敎育當局予以改善、現復準備呈請港督羅富國爵士、呈文尙在起草中、但在此舉積極進行之際、大部份僑校已紛紛實行增收學費、</p>
<p>貧苦學生迫得輟學</p>
<p>據査增加學費之學校、以本港方面至多、除若干規模較大學校、如仿林·港僑·西南·光華·領島·知行·華南·梅芳等外、較小者均紛紛增高學費、如堅道某大女子中學幼稚園生、一個學期學費、由十八元增至二十兀、小學分一二年三四年及五六年等級收費、均增收二元、初中·高中·前者山三十二元增至三十六元、復由三十六元增至四十元、較小之學校、多每年增高學費　元、即每學期增加五元、大概以增高百分之二十者爲最普遍、有若干學校、曩年廣爲招學生或優待貧民計、多設半費生學額、現查此等學校、多取銷原有享受半費學生之優待、須繳納全費、吾則、須行退學、查　等學生、旣屬貧苦、一時遂難應付、多被迫退學、又有若干學校於學生報名時、幷未聲明增高學費、及至繳費時、始悉畢校將學費抬高、家長對此、多不滿意、</p>
<p>投備簡陋亦增學費</p>
<p>査僑校學費多不劃一、但多視乎學校之規模而定收費之多寡、設備簡陋奢其收費自較頗具規模之學校爲廉、但現時此等設備簡陋之學校、其收費等於較優之學校、而欲轉者、又每因各校均吿額滿、未能如願、迫得仍在舊校攻讀云、</p>
<p>增加學費另有理由</p>
<p>據記者調査、僑校增費理由、係藉口本港頒行新敎育條例、致學校須請多改革、負担增多、故增加學費彌助、另一理由則爲屋租增高、但據記者向本港若干敎育界領袖探詢、得悉港府最近頒行之敎育新例、現時尙未致影響學校驟然增加負担、事實上敎育當局尙未嚴格執行新例、如學校藉口增收學費、使僑胞增重敎育費之負担、似屬不當、且現時在請求港府改善新例中、結果如何、刻尙未悉、若於此時遽然增加學費、未免過早云、</p>
<h3>中學生生活指導（一）</h3>
<p>— 汪懋祖</p>
<p>（昆明通訊）留　歸國、歷任國內著名大學敎授、及省立中學校長多年、現任中央政治學校分校主任在典存氏、近頃爲「中學生生活指導」一文、對於中學生生活指導的人選、心理的特徵、及指導方法等、剴切指示、極有價値、爰特錄其原文如下、現時的中學生、在不久的將來、便是再造國家民族的中堅、據五年前的敎育統計、我國中等學校學生、占全國人數每萬中人十二人、除去中途輟學的、恐怕不到千分之一、換言之、每個中學生要擔當領導一千人的責任、固然其上還有大學生、但是大學及專科學生、也須從中學出身、所以中學生的訓導、關係國家命脈、實在萬分重要、抗戰以來、如三民主義靑年團的組織、是以中學生爲主要對象的、精神總動員、也要靠着靑年團的服務、作爲推動之中堅、希望在這艱鉅的抗戰建國途程上、產生出多數健全勇敢奮進的新靑年、來創造繼起的民族新生命、本文所述、是限於中等學校內的生活指導、</p>
<p>第一　指導員的人選</p>
<p>中學內生活指導、當然由敎師擔負、而允以導師爲中心負責人、導師人選、第一是篤信三民主義，具有正確的政治見解、第二是肯體貼靑年、研究靑年情緒的、第三是教授功課、能獲得學生信仰常能以良好的暗示及正確的理解、開悟學生的、第四總之要能以身作則、不憚煩瑣、而態度誠懇、熱情能感的、以上四項、如能全備、可說是全國最上等的敎師了、</p>
<p>第二　中學生心理發育的特徵</p>
<p>本題規定指導的對象、旣是中學生、那末關於中學生身心的發展、必須先有一番檢討及研究、作爲指導方法的依據、中學生的年齡的自十二三歲至二十歲、其中差別很大、高中與初中學生活動、因爲經騐程度及生理發育階段的不同、必須分別指導、但其發育的集中趨勢、即是靑春發動時期、身體與精神起了急劇的變化、要養成什麼樣的人格、便在這個關頭、他們心理上特微、槪言之、爲（一）一感情的發旺靑春期生活、可說是感情的生活、雖然、理智方面、也甚進步、但常爲感情衝動所蔽、他們同情心極發達、忠於團體、愛護弱小、崇拜英雄、愛打不平、簸愛受人稱讚、因爲感情太盛、所以遇到興趣的事、便極熱烈、一經碰壁之後、便會沮喪不振、倘使得到不適當的安慰或疏解、强者趨入歧途、弱者變爲麻木頽廢，是不可不愼的（二）「理想的活躍」他們對於森羅萬象的客觀世界、理解力當然不够、但其求知的衝動極强、什麽事情想像試騐之、同時在他們心意之中、形成種種理想、背後是感情活動着、在現實世界中、人生到處是矛盾、是受限制、而靑春期理想的性質、是極其流轉活躍的、加以好奇心的强盛、所以聽了一篇慷慨激昂的演說之後、可以隨風而靡、至於犧牲生命、或者得了小說的暗示、可以沉醉迷惑去過那流浪的生活、從前有靑年看紅樓夢而發在、前幾年報載有三數中學生結伴要到崑崙山修道的事實、可以說靑春期的生活、是富於文學性及宗敎性的、（三）「結團與敵對」靑年人好小團結、如「弟兄會」、「十姊妹」等、與他團敵對競爭、根據這點、英國中學球塲的訓練、可以養成公道競爭及政治道德、如果別有利用、就成爲政爭的工具、我們應當把這種小團結的觀念、擴充爲大團結、把敵對的競爭行爲、引導到合作的競爭、又靑年喜自炫、愛戴高帽子、可以證明自我性的發達、因爲經騐淺薄、做事幷不計較利害、往往越出軌範、所以在鼓動之中、要時時加以適度的裁制、（四）「犯罪的傾向」宵年感情衝動及其剩餘的精力旣甚充旺、如果沒有適當的機會去疏導宣洩、就會發生苦悶、自己去尋求滿足的方法、橫衝直撞出來、有的事件、動機並不壞、但因不知道應付的方法、發生了犯法的行爲、在英美各國、設有靑年法庭、施行感化、</p>

<h3>金融　華商猛結遠期外匯</h3>
<p>外滙市况、匯豐掛牌揭曉、均無上落、英美匯暗市情　、晨初平靜、晚閒忽有變化、初開以海外美英滙兌再縮一分、致開市續吿英平美緊之故態、續計四便士一四〇六二五、及六元六五六二五、開後情勢呆滯、洋行曁投機商及日洋行雖先後扒吸、但供者尙不缺乏、故而半日絲毫未動、午後始尙告定、越二時一刻、某華行首來猛結四月期美滙、同時投機商亦復來活動、加之日洋行續來搜購市象驟吿步軟、惟英金幸賴匯豐維持、緊勢尙微、迄至晚收英金爲四便士一二五、美滙見、六元五九三七五、並爲全日最緊價、結果較上日英軟〇一五六二五　美縮〇九三七五、期貨　勢與現貨反稍見軋攏、</p>
<p>晨初尙平靜</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條、近遠期各縮二五、紐約銀價仍平、倫教生金呆定、匯兌英對美　法等各匯俱平、美對英續降一分、對滬未更、對法小半分、中央掛牌因　逢孫總理逝　世紀念、該行循全例休業、故無行市、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金四便士　四〇六二五、美匯六元六五六二五、較之前收、養平美緊〇三一二五、乃滙兌　縮之故、開後洋行扒人外行少數現貨英金四便士一四〇六二五、爲狀殊平、滙豐掛牌揭曉勿動、此後某華行代港方吐予有利本月份英金四便士一二五、同時華行上海售予同行四月份美滙六元五九三七五、並錢兌業塞予德華美金票六兀七五、供求平衡、仍鮮變化、不久投機商亦來結入外行　本月份美匯六元六二五、接踵日洋行亦購納某行四月期美誰六元五六二五、狀態續形呆平、惟入後段機商尙欲購買本月期美滙、但外行對上價已鮮賣胃、致未曾得手、延至收盤、英美匯現貨價俱與晨開相同、期貨則英平美略帶軟、本月份六元六二五難結、下月期祇有六元五三一二五、</p>
<p>午後驟轉緊縮</p>
<p>後市初開平穩、嗣因某華行首　來猛結四月　期美匯、接踵日洋行及投機商亦力向期貨活動、故市面驟見緊縮、計某華行結進大通等外行四月份美滙六元五三一二五　及半元、　時投機商亦結進有利某行四月份美匯六元半、並日洋行結進外行四月份　美滙六元半、及同月份英金四便士〇七八一二五、時外行亦購納匯豐現貨英金四便士一二五、故英金緊勢向微、迄至晚收、英金四便士一二五、美滙六元五九三七五、本月份英金四便士一二五、閂滙六元五九三七五難結、下月份英金四便士〇七八一二五、美匯六元半、結果比上日現貨英緊〇一五六二五、美軟〇九三七五、期貨英平美縮〇六二五、</p>
<p>香港美滙亦縮</p>
<p>香港十二日（週二）電、今日匯市開盤吿平、英匯現貨不動、遠期鬆〇三一二五、爲一先令二便士　八四三七五、美滙現貨回緊〇六二五、爲二十三元八七五、申匯現貨微降二角半、爲三百五十七元二角五分、日滙現貨亦縮二角五分、爲一百零一元二角五分，十一時三十分平穩、英滙日滙不動、美滙現貨續緊〇六二五、爲二十三元八一二五、申滙現貨續降二角五分、爲三百五十七元、午收微軟、美滙現貨冉縮〇六二五、爲二十三元七五、下午二時三十分、開盤吿軟、各滙概無變動、</p>
<p>天津滙俱長</p>
<p>天津十二日（週二）電、今晨匯市開盤告平、英滙現貨鬆〇三一二五、爲三便士七五、美滙現貨長〇六二五、為六元〇六二五、申匯降一元為一百〇九元五角、「聨鈔」暗裏盤貴一元五角、為一百〇一元五角、</p>
<h3>某行猛進　金市漲風又起　已近四千九百元大關</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、賡續上騰、蓋以投機商心意購買愈烈、且香港帮吃胃仍健、更傳某華行亦從中搜入、午後再以外匯報緊、更使買戶勇往直前、漲勢允厲、直趨收盤爲止、竟好起九十二元、至當日買賣、晨開即漲七元、爲四千八百元、原因美匯稍緊、繼因銀樓帮更有塞出、曾回小至四千七百九十七兀、但港帮忽躍出活　、某金號及散戶亦競相拖進、加之不久某錢兌業亦代本帮在撈、遂高達四千八百三十元、未幾因散戶獲利肯售、金號復賣、會回小十餘元　某錢兌業乘機再撈、故迄午收仍有四千八百　十五元、午後因某錢兌業繼續猛扒、加之證券帮亦滿懷進意、目斯時外匯突報步緊、而散戶空頭見景忍痛抵補、雖初時某金號曾來供塞、不意將近收盤時、亦轉出扒進、故迄晚收、遂見四千八百八十五元高峯、全天交易暢旺的二千五六百兩、銀樓飾金步高十元、海關金等仍平、</p>
<p>烚漲九十二元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初開因聞美匯略軟、人氣仍烈、某金號與證券帮互相抬價搜買、開市即高七元、金號進銀號五十兩、爲四千八百元、少頃銀樓帮及現余號吐出回挫三元、現金號售予證券帮二十兩、爲四千七百九十七元、嗣後港帮突起活動、委某金號曁某銀樓代爲拖入、同時錢兌業亦代散戶跟進、價遂立刻橫跳、不久即漲達四千八百十元關外、其時某錢兌業亦追踪猛進、漲風允烈、再躍十餘元、某金號進銀樓帮三十兩、爲四千八百三十元、旋以某金號獲利復吐、且散戶多頭亦稍有了結、而斯時買者吃胃轉呆、頓見回落十四元、現金號賣予錢兌業五十兩、爲四千八百十六元、此後某錢兌業復來搜羅、加之某　券帮亦有撈入、遂再徐徐上升、迄至收盤已高達四千八百二十五元、午後更影堅挺、開市即高五元、某銀號進證券帮三十兩、爲四千八百三十元、俄而某錢兌業什港帮猛吸、再加證券帮亦來搜買、且斯時外匯報望、續漲五十元、證劵帮進銀號、及銀樓帮共百兩、爲四千八百八十元、其時某金號突來力售回撳二十四元、證券帮互做三十兩、爲四千八百五十六元、人後因外匯美金續緊、買風父起、某金號忽止塞猛拾、同時某錢兌業與證券帮重來吸納、再抬二十九元、銀號進錢兌業五十兩、爲四千八百八十五元作晚收價、結果比上日猛漲九十二元、全天八十八元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤較高數元、收進减低二十兀、現標金照掛牌金低五十餘元、均鮮做開、</p>
<p>首飾金掛大十元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、初時大同行仍懸四百八十五元、迨至十時半掛大五元，午後四時又掛高五元、結果大同行改懸四百九十五元、新同行與上價相同、牧進减低十五元光景、</p>
<h3>銀行準備會　續增匯劃利率</h3>
<p>上海銀行　業聯合凖備　委員會、因市面銀根續緊、增加滙劃拆息、昨日通函各行、自三月十二日起、改訂利率如左、公單拆　息國幣二角八分、滙劃二角五分、承兌滙票九十日期貼現率國幣二角八分、滙劃二角五分、領用同業滙劃息二角二分、同業滙劃拆放欠息二角七分、（均係每千元每日計算）「附註」上項利率、與三月二日相較、國幣未有更動、滙劃利率均增二分、</p>
<h3>美金票　一度達十五元</h3>
<p>昨日外幣、遭鎊價虛弱影響、吸納甚殷、市價甚堅挺、英美金鎊、供給稀少、英美金票、需要甚盛、美金票晨升爲十四元八角一分、午後史升爲十五元、晚市稍回爲十四元九角八分、香港票法郞票、供給不爽、新加坡票何蘭票一致堅升、坎票斐律賓票、追踪昂貴、日余票穩定、晚市爲一元二角九分六厘、朝鮮票仍爲　元零一分二厘、昨日市價、英金鎊升二元、英金票升二角、美金鎊升、一元五角、美金票升二角五分、香港票升五厘、法郞票升四厘、新加坡票·荷蘭票·羅比票供升五分、安南票·坎票·斐律濱票、俱升一角、其他各幣未更、</p>
<h3>英印銀價俱降　美銀仍平</h3>
<p>十一日倫敦電、銀市大衆少數賣出、缺乏維持、收盤後尙平、大條銀、近遠期均縮二五、紐約銀電、美現貨仍平、又孟買銀電、印銀市況軟弱、現期各跌十二安那、成交單祇二十五張、</p>
<h3>貼現軋小半元　拆息掛高一分</h3>
<p>昨匯劃票據貼現率、先跌後回、每千元上午由四十七元步低至四十二元、午刻回上至四十六元、下午續步升至四十八兀半、比前日軋小五角、錢業公會拆息、早午兩市均掛升一分、達一角七分云、</p>
<h3>紗花　粵幫春銷略動　棉紗紗勢加厲　雙馬期貨抬至九四八元紗</h3>
<p>紗市續升、且漲風愈厲、此因人心一致看高、熱烈異常、同時粵帮對於三二支·二十支細紗春銷路形起色、於是掀起買風、投機商乘機推波助瀾、、然近來耳聞某紗漲力較爲和緩、不及本紗之在驟也、如果價格比例相差太遠、華紗亦受牽制、</p>
<p>現紗晨開人氣續挺、買者紛紛不絕、二十支雙馬紗三月份開價爲九百三十九九、旋聞外匯又縮〇三一二五、多方活動尤烈、市盤步開步升、至九百四十七八元、收盤價爲九百四十七元半、査半日間成交統計一千九百七十元、行情二十支雙馬現貨漲十六元、茲將各帮口買去之額量分列如左、</p>
<p>香港　七三五內地　五五</p>
<p>同行一、一八　統計一、九七〇</p>
<h3>印棉定價漸近　花已不及紗之昂</h3>
<p>本棉交易尙稱不弱、但比上日爲稀、行情無甚軒輊、紗市雖步步上升、然棉市反見溫和而平澹、實則廠方需要不發展之故也、同時印棉定價漸漸接近、各花號開始購訂印棉、所以棉花人心、不及紗市之昂、蘇北來源未見、茲將現棉成交情形列左、</p>
<p>另訊外棉市價、紐約棉市、晨初先形市上上缺乏重要之買戶、及利物浦來電吿跌、市况因之頗形疲乏、加之海外棉商之在市拋賣、結果收盤價格近期跌四五磅音、然遠期反見漲起三磅音、印度棉市因有歐洲和平空氣之說、故市價昨日連同預測又跌落四羅比餘、埃及漲三五磅音、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、日來因匯兌之緊縮、故同業間交易頗爲靜寂、廠商則以到貨甚擠、購意頗爲淡薄、日商廠方亦然、茲將昨日棉市以美匯六元六二五折合送廠價如下、</p>
<p>二十支　美米特林　二六九·二〇</p>
<p>二十支　美迷特林下級二五八·五〇</p>
<p>三十二支美米特林　二八二·〇〇</p>
<p>三十二支美米特林下級二七一·〇〇</p>
<p>四十二支美米特林　二八五·二〇</p>
<p>四十二支美米特林下級二七三·二〇</p>
<h3>證劵　內債市塲一　洋股平疲</h3>
<p>證</p>
<p>券暗盤、昨日市况仍在盤旋醖釀局面中渡過、多日來絕無上落、謂爲銀根過緊、投資裏足、則金子昨又大漲、外股交易依然發達、謂爲環境無變化、則外匯逐步緊縮、足以反影情况之變異、此均非癥結之所在、蓋自貨品在漲後、一般投機者、不免別有會心而播弄、處此惡劣洪流中、全賴金融界大數保留不出、市上流動籌碼究屬有限、如無劇烈變動、不易引起波動、故年來仍能保持其中級市價、目下盤旋不已、前已數見不鮮、故暫時仍不為遂有變化也、昨日買賣各戶尤爲淡漠、市塲集會不及十數分鐘即散、結果仍祗五分上落而已、全日交易的有三十餘萬元、茲烈簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交大陸銀行股二十股、每股價六百元正、此决股票、每股票面爲一千元、合六折行市、</p>
<p>昨日衆公所股市爲孫中山先生逝世紀念日、華商銀行大都休業股市因是甚覺黯澹、早晨交易稀少、價格則形平穩、下午市况較爲活潑、因賣戶稍多、故價微有跌落、近收市時、賣方陣綫、條吿動搖、大多規復原價、收盤趨勢穏定、橡皮脫無色彩</p>
<p>倫</p>
<p>倫敦十　日（週一）電云、今日中國外債、曁英商遠東各公司股票、掛牌行市、均吿平穩、上下檔各債券、及各種股票、概無上落、</p>
<h3>海味　新香菌首盤已開</h3>
<p>昨某號到有處州新香菌十件、價開六百七十五元六角、惟聞下次輪船有大批可到、市勢看鬆、建菰產價據報又升三十元、</p>
<h3>糧食　錫糧大跌　洋米又有到滬</h3>
<p>無錫米稻市况、近日一般囤戶客船、賣出踴躍、市上米稻樣包日見增多、行廠訂售白粳、前後雖有六萬石、但碾米同業、限於目存手貨、不得拋訂在市補進、因此活動市面、一反從前景象、致成供過於求、米稻市價逐步回鬆、最近三數日間、糙白粳跌落每石兩元左、右粳秈元稻亦每担低一元、現高白粳、每石廿七元五角至廿七元、糙粳廿四五元、粳稻每担十二元七八角、市面已入正常、雜糧自紅盤開始以還、速續猛漲允以黃茶豆小麥芝蔴、每石飛騰十餘元、近來滬市物價亦漸趨跌、以致錫地人心、一致見虛、是以有手貨者、因盈利已巨、紛求出脫、週內黃菉豆芝蔴、每石劇落十元、小麥亦跌數兀、麵粉今年自每包十一二元、逐步漲至十四五元、純由投機賣買、操縱壟斷所造成、統市存粉有二十餘萬包、大都在囤戶手中、全邑麵食、日需不足百百包　此項存粉、如禁運出境、可以銷至年底、近見滬上反動趨跌、紛求出檔、現粉小至十二元三四角、期粉小至十一元以內、尙乏人問津、旬內跌落每包二元之譜、（知）</p>
<p>羊米昨又有到滬、係太古公司太原輪自海防裝來四千三百四十七包、香港裝來五千三百十包、共計九千六百五十七包昨日中午進口、停靠法租界本行碼頭起卸、（祖）</p>
<h3>糖市　上檔車白回好</h3>
<p>昨糖市無一甚上落、公會劃盤、二四粗白本棧現貨六十二元、外棧新到六十一元六角、老貨六十一元三角、僅升一角、太古車白回升三五角、西棧B嘜又到六十六元、CX嘜六十五元半、CX嘜原價未動、DY嘜六十四元、升二角、其餘均少更動、國糖零星稍有成交、價亦站定、又十二日由海口來糖二千二百包、</p>
<h3>五金　竹節鋼條稍平定</h3>
<p>竹節鋼條交易、昨來仍感頻繁、本街建築帮所辦最多、惟外埠生意亦相當然閙、行情因同業心思高昂、仍感堅硬、惟較之昔時、已跌落五六十元之巨、刻市如三分至四分每噸沾一千〇五十元、五分至一寸每噸售一千元云、</p>
<h3>疋頭　呢絨客銷不弱</h3>
<p>昨呢羢客路走銷不寂、批發戶郵寄包裹甚夥、內地帮俱以草黃草綠嗶嘰·華特呢·馬褲呢·制服呢等居多數、商用呢羢花色貨、統須國產品、且須由廠家出立運銷執照、堆在淪陷區域、因不拘何國出品、致銷路較內地爲多、尤以平·津二帮爲最、</p>
<h3>絲茶　乾繭源來滬　絲廠原料恐慌可解</h3>
<p>去年上海絲廠、經營雖都獲利、然原料受人箝制、致未能充份發展、截至年底年初、所有絲廠幾全部停工、現悉浙東繭子已源源來滬、計首批由海達輪裝來共計一千〇十二件、第二三批亦將啣接運來、故在新繭上塲前之絲廠、對於原料恐已可部份解決云、</p>
<p>又訊、人造絲昨由香港來二十五箱、茶葉由寗波來一千六百六十件、</p>
<h3>新形勢與生絲業</h3>
<p>— 易之</p>
<p>在戰事第三年中、不論國內和國外、都在急劇起着變化、這變化就形成了現在的新形勢、即是歐戰的爆發、與日美商的廢棄及德蘇不侵犯條的成立、以及日德軸心的分化、這在中日戰事上、由於對方的國際環境更形孤立、再加上三年來中國主觀力量上的加强、於是這新形勢也就影響到生絲業、因爲這些情形是有利於中國、所以也有利於中國絲業、不過有利的形勢、要善於運用、善於運用、必面探求新形對於生絲業的產銷、可能有些什麼反應、</p>
<p>（一）有人說日美商約的廢業、對於華絲美銷、必將大有起色、因為美國是世界最大的生絲消費國、商約中斷之後、必然使華絲的競爭者有些不利、這種意見是有一部是準確的、不過事實尙不如此簡單、因爲商的的廢棄、不能說就是日美的經濟絕交、這小過是美國統治者要迫使日本就範的一種步驟、同時這就範」兩個字、也小是在眞正「制彼於死命」、而是要求日本在美國的　度（日美均勢的限度）下、依然强橫地生存在遠東做個帝國主義的警察、這對於中國的解放、對於中國民族資本的發展、同樣是一條兇狠的束縛、因了這個原故、美國購買日絲、雖然在無　約期中、但也不會像我們理想一樣會大大的衰减、相反的、這仍會像　量軍火與汽油一樣、繼續小斷運往日本（見二月二九日哈瓦斯電美國的矛盾）、而日本絲也會一仍其舊源源不斷地輸送到美國市塲、不過華絲的美銷、是可能也有些進步的、這是由於美國人民大衆的正義感所造成、這就是今年華絲美銷的一個預測、</p>
<p>（二）在歐洲方面、不要說歐戰的蔓延、司能擴大起來、直至毀滅了英法的市塲、破壞整個歐洲的經　組織（然而事實上將無法避免這種趨向）、而單就日美商的中斷後所給予歐洲絲市的影響、華絲在歐的地位、却可能受到相當排擠、因爲當英國一見日美商的續訂無望時、老早就躍躍欲試、想在這個機會上、來提高　日貿易的數字（見二月×日倫教電）、同時、在日絲的主觀上、當然也要另想出路、以彌補或多或少由於日美商約廢棄下所受的損失、然則華絲銷美旣無如理想中的進步、而在歐洲方面却可能遭到意外的打擊、日絲的大量輸到英法、這就是今年華絲歐銷的預測、</p>
<p>關於這個預測、我們還要加上歐戰今後的　行問題、聯合考慮進去、就是說、縱使日絲輸歐的數量、不致太大、而　洲的絲市、也將因了戰事的發展、在歐亞交通運輸　、在全歐人民經濟生活上、而大大的平添許多難關、使市塲縮小、或者停頓、（未完）</p>

<p>上海郵政管理局竟徇日方要求、開發　　　　　地日軍用票之匯票、茲探錄各情如次、</p>
<p>破壞規律</p>
<p>上海郵政管理局徇日方要求、竟於本月十日起、公衆得向郵局開發澳口·九江·兩地之日軍用票滙票、上項措施、因完全與郵政匯兌章程抵觸、故極爲外間所注目、</p>
<p>並未呈報</p>
<p>上項事件、純係上海郵政管理局長乍配林會同日籍副郵務畏金指謹一郎片面與日方商定、並未呈報總局核准、故衆信總局於聞悉此事後、必來電詰責、</p>
<p>以局拒發</p>
<p>上項進兌軍　票辦　、尙祗限於淪陷區　實行、故上海之兩租界內各郵政支局、均不照辦祇虹口有恒路支局可匯、其兌付局亦祇限漢口　九江兩地、</p>

<p>據接近郵　界人十向大通社記者表示，郵局上項舉措、純爲應付環境、避免日方軍人與淪陷區郵局發生磨擦、故甚望外間能鑒諒其苦心、</p>

<h3>瞬將揭幕之　防癆大運動　定期假虹橋療養院舉行　X光攝影及檢驗均免費</h3>
<p>本市各界領　聯合發起之大規模上海市陵癆運動、自籌備進行以來、一切漸吿就緒、昨日假座銀行公會俱樂部招待各界及新聞界、到虞洽卿·林康侯·袁履登·徐寄廎·裴雲卿·丁福保·趙晉卿·江一平·葛福田·潘仰堯·許冠羣·許曉初·黃雨齋·王劍鍔·何五良·朱賡陶·羅之燦·朱雨陶·王完白·朱仰高·董杏生·王靖東·黃嘉音·孫籌成·丁惠康·林之福·江一秋·等、約　百餘人、</p>
<p>各國防癆成績一般</p>
<p>公推會長林康侯氏主席、旋由主席闡述此項運動之重要性、略謂世界人類、無不遭受肺癆之侵襲、如美國在本世紀初、肺癆死亡率、居各種死亡率之第一位、但至今已退至第六位、德國亦由每萬人中死亡十二人、减爲七人、此種成績、固由各國衛生醫療之進步、但實際允得力於防癆之努力、</p>
<p>孤島現狀肺癆猖獗</p>
<p>惟我國爲肺癆最多之國、又因公共衛生設備之欠缺、及防癆方法之米加注意、致肺癆之死亡率、有增無减、允以今日特殊情形下之孤島、人口激增、環境惡劣、肺癆蔓延、愈形猖獗、而一般病家、狃於積習、全恃無效藥物、因循時日、貽悮病機、實爲迭成肺癆高度紀錄之最大原因、不特病家個人之牛命時間經濟、遭受難於計算之損失、同時使社會國家喪失人材、减少生產、間接損失、允不可以數計、良堪痛心、</p>
<p>拘救之道端在診斷</p>
<p>挽救之道、以有喚起社會、使有防癆知識、庶可破除不良積習、而信賴正確診斷、即X光檢査、實爲减少肺病及其傳染之惟一條件、無論何人、欲灼知有無肺病、或病至若何程度、亦惟X光診斷、爲最正確之裁判員、此項X光診斷、允以早期施行、更甚有益、</p>
<p>着重檢舉預防蔓延</p>
<p>良以潛伏性肺癆患者、爲數極多、有時且屬於開放性、即咯痰中已含有結核菌、而病者毫不自覺、此種結核菌、實爲傳染肺癆之源泉、其傷生害人、危險甚於市虎、但一經X光診斷、潛伏肺癆、即可發覺、一方面得以早期治療、節省時間經濟、而收時半功倍之效、一方面則藉以减少傳染之危險、於家庭幸福、公共衛生，社會健康、關係極爲重大云云、决由副會長袁履登裴雲卿許冠羣黃雨齋陶樂勤諸氏相繼　說、各有極透澈之言論、合座鼓掌、</p>
<p>靑年男女尤宜注意</p>
<p>袁履登演講、略謂我國從前民性固執、凡患有肺癆病者、決不向人設明、而年齡在廿歲至卅歲間、患者最多、亦最危險、希諸位極力宣傳、使各人有預先防範之機會云、决爲許冠羣演說、略謂、防癆問題之嚴重、不亞民食問題、古時治病、有採秘方仙丹者、其効力如何、人皆盡知、足證藥物一事、亦祇能起輔助作用、疾病貴在預防云云、王完白醫師講述中國死亡率、普通（包括婦孺老幼）爲七分之一、即死七人中有一人爲患肺癆病者、二十至卅歲間、則爲三分之一、死三人中患肺癆病者即占其一、欲撲滅此人類大敵、非動員全市各界、廣爲宣傳不可、</p>
<p>丁惠康談防癆動機</p>
<p>末由丁惠康醫師發表此運動之動機、略謂、前年在重慶檢騐學生體格於一萬人中、健康者祗有六十五人、可見中國人體格之不健全、中外醫藥不同之點有二、外人重檢騐、須經診斷後、方再治療、我國人則反是、重服藥而輕忽檢騐、息病者心理、十九希望立即痊愈、殊不知此種程序、對精神經濟兩有損失、而個人之健康、對於國家前途、大有關係、全望各界人士之合力宣揚焉、</p>
<p>各方贊助定期實施</p>
<p>此項大規模之防癆運動、各方均一致贊助、其實施計劃中、除普及X光早期診斷外、並舉行免費X光攝影、免費咯痰檢騐、免費肺癆病診察等基本工作、現決定於本月十五日、假霞飛路九九〇號虹橋療養院開始舉行、其增進市民健康、及嘉惠一般貧病、實非淺鮮也、</p>
<h3>新輔幣已流通　舊鑄幣停止兌發</h3>

<h3>片言卻盜</h3>
<p>金陵泥馬巷，醫生楊立菴家，於上月初十日二更時，忽有人叩門，女僕出問，云是請先生者。及啟關，則一塗面持刀者昂然而入，女僕欲喊，其人以刀背向僕頭七一試，謂喊者由一刀兩段，但將大門閉上，盜向內室進。楊有二女，時在堂前閒話，突見一塗面持刀者入，驚呼有盜，其長女奔入房內，决女奔赴後門外，大喊救命，其時楊正在房濯足，聞呼有盜，趕即起立，果見一人持刀進房來，楊對之曰：「你何必要塗面而來。」揚之意，蓋謂我非富戶，你何必塗着面要來打刦我，實哀乞之詞也。不料盜誤認楊已覻破其貌，遂回頭便走，但將刀在門枋上連砍數刀，一若示以來追便砍之意。及鄰佑聞呼，羣來救護，盜已杳無影響；但見楊闔家男婦，或坐或立，皆口不言，身不動，眼睛不轉，儼然如泥塑木雕者，蓋均已嚇得魂靈兒飛去半天矣。噫！險已。</p>

<p>舊夢秋蓴，餘哀臘雪，盡瘁申報復</p>
<p>興而後，奕世猶傳長者親。</p>
<p>報館之使命，比肩於良史。民二十二申報年鑑史公量才發刋詞，昭垂奕葉，誠不刋之論也。申報爲中國歷史最悠久之日刊，自發行以逮今日，已屆六十七年，而張蘊和前輩之盡瘁於報者，將四十年，却占申報已往歷史之大牛部，精心壹志，久而彌堅，正不僅闔館回人，一致傾佩而已。猶憶距今二十九年前，上海出版界名碩夏粹芳先生曾語一之曰：『報之爲業至勞苦，幸葆少年身，恐君數年後，力有所弗勝。』而蘊公前輩以及編輯室協纂諸公，大抵下榻館中，視館事如家事，不僅樂之，而且安之，三更燈火五更雞之生活，亘數十年之久如一日，此則史公量才之體念殷切，待遇優隆，與夫新建巨厦設備之完善，當有以助成之，一之生平周視南北美東西歐諸大報館，每見夜班値勤之記者，至多不過寥寥兩二人，且至深夜一時以後，大抵掃塲扃戶而去，因歎西方機械世界辦報者之省時省力，遠非一般人意料所及，而更深致佩於中國文人之自尊心與持久力，信乎足以代表東方古文明，而超越夫世界各之上者也。蔣院長一月十六日渝電勗勉全國小學敎師之曰：『深念諸君，在學校敎室爲國盡瘁，功效之偉大，不下於覆塲轉戰之官兵。」一之敬貢駑愚，致唁蘊公前輩曰：「執筆之士在報館，爲社會服務，事業之崇宏，固有勝於安富尊榮之大使，而擔　之重大，又不减於堅苦卓絕之小學敎師與官兵。』今日者，臘雪南枝，傳來噩耗，秋蓴張翰，緬想前規，爰撰二十五言聯，用伸愛敬之私於萬一焉。</p>
<h3>偷竊書籍與出入舞塲</h3>
<p>— 鵬</p>
<p>自學費，書籍都漲價以後，木刊上已經發表過不少呼籲及檢討的文字，事實上在這處處遭　統制，與步步發生困難的環境中，漲價自然也不得已的苦衷，然而投機取巧者的推波逐瀾，也是無可否認的事實。米，煤如此；學校，書商也是如此。</p>
<p>於是「孤島」上造成了兩種飢荒　肚子與知識。</p>
<p>十一日本報社會新聞版上載着這樣一段新聞：自稱爲開明中學學生孫玉崑，於本月八日在商務印書館竊取經濟學及政治學等書籍四巨冊，價値三十餘元。被該館稽査查出，扭交捕房，昨解第一特院，被告承認無力購買書籍，而又愛好所竊各書，因而行竊云云。</p>
<p>從這則新聞中可以看出莘莘學子知識飢荒的程度與一般貧苦大衆的吐皮飢荒是同樣嚴重了。但是麪粉尙有平賣，洋米也在平糶，而要我尋一所學費書費平價的學校和書店，實在是太難了！</p>
<p>所以，在我們偶然發現了這一則竊書籍新聞之後，可以想像到現在不知有多少好學的靑年，被迫而「失學」了！「竊書」呢，是和「搶米」同校犯罪的，我們對孫玉昆果然覺得其情可憫，不過他的方法是錯誤的；希望他在拘役期滿之後，不妨到圖書館等地方去塡塞他所需要的知識，或者向師長同學處借閱，一個向上的靑年，他是能磨礪中克服他的困難的。祇要記住所以迫使他失學，竊書的恥辱；這恥辱總有洗雪的一天！</p>
<p>一個好學的靑年因爲無力購書籍而行竊，雖能引起人們的憐憫，但行竊總是種恥辱，可是有許多學生，能够安適地在大學裏讀書，寗願出入舞塲，揮金如土，不肯購買書籍，增進學識，浪費父母以汗血得來的金錢，銷磨較黃金更貴的光陰，徒然負了大學生的頭銜，在這大時代中環境的靑年如此墮落，豈非也是一種恥辱麽？</p>
<h3>改善舊式學徒制</h3>
<p>— 朱凱慶</p>
<p>我是一個學徒的過來人，雖然現在已經脫離了那種苦悶生活；但是，我覺得要為後繼的學徒們求一點解放，使他們的前途得到一綫光明，所以懇切的來執鞭於學徒們的主人呼籲。</p>
<p>做學徒須寫給老闆一張三五年的如賣身契的關紙，在規定的學習期內，服服貼貼在老　的權威之下忍性苦學。苦學果然是凡百事業的基礎，但是學徒進店之後，那裏有眞正儘量學習工技的機會，通常都是在做些淘米，洗菜，以致做更下等的事；偶而閒暇之間，師父是勉强敎他們一點工技方法，但是憑良心說，那裏有學到多少本領；恐怕在飾父的高聲叫駡中，連魂魄都甚至要被嚇掉吧。一直是這樣的生活，過了三五年，算滿師了，經老　定了二三元的月薪，必須再要在他店內做上一二年的報師恩；甚至，還要請了幾桌酒席，方才廢了關紙，能自由的離開他店內。這種束縛學徒們的制度，未免太殘酷！老闆門固然是收益萬分，但學徒們好好的靑春時間，就是這樣的被店主剝奪，無謂的虛度過去。我們試想，這些普通的技藝，那裏要這許多的年代，儘可一年半載的在短時期內速成；這非特對於老闆們有利，並且對於社會方面，也有絕大的貢獻。所以勸勸一般的老闆們，絕對不要自私，須要以社會的需要，來訓練學徒，這樣，必定一舉兩得的有好結果，至於改良舊制的方法，已有現代的工廠大商店等的對待練習生的榜樣可倣效了。</p>
<h3>雨過天靑</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第廿一回　理經綸混合纖維質　興機械佐成文字功</p>
<p>邵　華一個電話打給瞿無雙，瞿無雙道：「好！慧華姊！我立刻就來。』不到三分鐘飯還　，幾　姊姊，都是想看看我們的報館而來的。因爲報是天天見的，白紙黑字，張一張的在市上飛舞，却不知道你們是怎樣弄出來的。那不我們就引導她們看一個粗枝　葉吧，我們也不必去驚數各部的人，就是我們兩人引導，諸位姊姊，也只算是走馬看花罷了。我們還是從最下　層看起好不好？』瞿無雙道：「很好！」那時她們便仍舊乘了電梯，直至最下一層的機器問來。這是一大廣間，可以算是牛地底室。裏面排列着一十四架捲簡機，這　十四架捲筒機中，有四架是美國貨，其餘一十架，部是中國機器廠自己的出品。在中國戰後新興的　初幾年，別的出產還好，就是機器一項，總不能不仰仗於舶來品。於是中國常把那種絲，茶，桐油，以及種種農業出品，與各國交換各種機器．後來中國的各處鐵礦，漸漸的開了；機器廠也設立得多了；在國外學機械學的人，也回國得多起來了。不但有許多機器，都能對於歐美倣造，而且能目出心裁，創造出更利便的新型來。所以現在這印報的捲筒機，都由中國自造了。不過這　十架捲筒機型式不同，因爲　館裏購置的時候，也不是一起購置的，而是逐漸添置進來的。每一次購置，便改了一種型式，也是逐漸的改進了。且說這二十四架捲筒機，連繫成四大陣營。所有印出的報，將整件的捲筒紙，安放在機器之上只要一轉瞬間，便摺疊得端端正正，一份份報紙，似推波逐浪而出。她們這一班姊妹，到了機器間，那時正在下午五點四十五分鈽，却見許多機器，都寂然不動，僅有極小一部分機器，正在印最後一次晚報。原來這家報館中，也出晚報。晚報每天出三次，下午四點鐘一次，五點鐘一次，六點鐘　次。名爲三次，其實並不什麽更換面目，僅略略改版而已。囚爲四點鐘出了晚報以後，四點以後，尙陸續有各處的電訊到來，便把要訊，補入以下兩次了。（二四九）</p>

<h3>天國的國民　（二）</h3>
<p>像他這樣一個人，有學問，有修養，人人相信他的道德。人人羨慕他的體面，人人承認他劉于聖經有廣博的學識，他本人也確信自己是天國一等國民。耶穌承認他的造詣，司時却很莊嚴的吿訴他距天國不還，尙須向前努力。再有一次，一位有錢的靑年。走到耶穌面前，問耶穌一個大問題，「我當做什麽，纔可以承受水生？」耶穌回答他說，「你須全心，全意，全力，愛主你的上帝。其次愛隣如己，這是律法中最大的。」靑年態度安詳而謙虛的說，「這些誡命我從小就遵守了。」這是資話，不是誇口。他向天國走了很遠的路，但耶穌却吿訴他仍須向前努力。耶穌說，一尙有一事，你不曾做到，你須去變賣所有的　齊窮人。」靑年聽了這話，覺得很難過的走了。因爲他的財產很多。而他走到眞工快樂的路，也就被他的財產隔斷了。以上所說的這兩個人，都與天國相距不遠，就停下來不走了。所以，我們今天要認明做天國國民的確實資格。我們不能做一個「差不多」的基督徒，也不能做一個「差不多」的好人。今日是科學世界，一切都重精確。六六三十六，這是數望上的精確，絕不因友誼關係而有參差，不論什麽心理學，不能改變牠。其他音樂，化學，物理，都是如此。耶穌認宗敎也是這樣，有偉大的　律管理着。音樂家不以爲音樂和諧之律，限止了他的自由，這正是引導他走到美妙的極峯。工程師遵守職務規則，然後機器纔會照一定樣式活動。同樣，這管理世人品行的律法，我們許不易遵行，但能使我們的人生可靠。所有道德上，精神上的一切限制，都是爲要使我們道德進步，並保障我們不墜落。這些律法，就是天國疆界所在，也就是做天國國民的資格。（待續）</p>

<h3>中國影星們的唱歌姿態</h3>
<p>— 姬燕</p>
<p>自從電影有聲以來，女明星差不多都會唱歌了，現在將熟知的幾位女明星的歌唱姿態寫在下面：</p>
<p>胡蝶，陳燕燕，安穩靜立，不聲不晌，唱完後，點無表示，謙恭之至，大有閨秀之風，二人之調子，特別的寬宏而高，所以隨便甚麼音調，很高或很低的譜子，對於他們兩個總小成問題。</p>
<p>黎莉莉，隨唱隨玩若無其事，唱完後，如果自己覺着得意，就雙脚齊跳，吾則就喊着「不算，不算，這决不算數。」</p>
<p>陳霴雲裳，黎明暉，唱歌的時候，活像山裏的猴子，天上的黃鶯，活潑勁兒，和小孩子一樣。可是她倆靜下來的時候，又像一位研究家似的沉默，有時她倆一面唱歌，一面還要顧到別人講話，五官四肢同時工作，但從來不會唱錯。</p>
<p>李麗蓮，她說：「我收一張唱片，像生個孩子似的痛苦，可是收完以後，又像生過了似的痛快。」的確，因爲她所唱的歌，都是些很快，很難的曲子，音樂也特別複雜，只有她，纔能够勝任呀。</p>
<p>胡珊，她是那樣的開暢爽利，她一來了，不用開口唱歌，就先送來一種「萬民同樂」，「天下太平」的象徵。</p>
<p>龔秋霞，仍然保存着小孩似的風度，她最喜歡唱兒童進行曲，在唱歌以前，必然要向左右的朋友們，作個孩子似的笑，唱的得意了，把舌頭伸仲，不得意，眉頭一皺。</p>
<p>談瑛，唱歌和拍影戲一樣，表情特別深刻，眉，眼，嘴，手，腰，腿，脚，一齊帮忙。</p>
<p>上述所有的明星們，唱起來，總是要用手指畫拍子，拍子的輕重，腔調的抑揚，都在手指上表情出來。</p>

<h3>觀「李秀成殉國」後</h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>「太閏天國」的崛起，是中國民族革命的先聲，由於當時淸廷的腐敗，民間的疾苦，這爆發的革命火花，從金田村起義，一路而下，可以說是勢如破竹；但是在奠定天京之後，苟安於目前地位而陷入於「神力」的矛盾中，至四王的猜忌嫉妬，又加深了作戰的困難。李秀成的遷都主張被淺見者的吾決之後，他祇能率領了「可以帶他們上活路」的兄弟姊妹們，困守「死城」。李秀成雖然失敗了，但是不足爲失敗主義者所可作爲藉口的，他的失敗是歷史條件所決定的，劇作者在第一慕中，是充份地說明了遷都的利害，但李秀成爲了忠於朝廷，深愛城中子弟，祇有更奮勇艱苦地戰鬭下去，希望湖州的援軍能解救天京的危難。他的死是會激起無數的李秀成接踵而起的。</p>
<p>所以「李秀成殉國」與「明來遺恨」同樣，劇作者所吿訴我們是一種敎訓：叛變和忠貞的對比。葛嫩良的罵賊而亡，李秀成的正氣磅礴，正是我們現在所需要的榜樣。</p>
<p>「李秀成殉國」分四幕：第一幕李秀成堅持遷都，第二幕　城協力死守，第三幕民衆的再接再厲，第四幕李秀成慷慨就義。寫作上雖相當粗綫條，但對李秀成的智勇的煊染，及「太平天國」所以遭致失敗的原因，還是心細如髮。更可愛的是第四幕李秀成的三杯敬酒，感人下淚。</p>
<p>嚴俊的李秀成，沉着堅定，咬字淸晰，較吳三桂，更多進步。</p>
<h3>梨園外紀</h3>
<p>— 徐慕雲</p>
<p>憶劉鴻聲之暴卒　（上）</p>
<p>當年鬚生行於汪·譚·孫·之外，尙有汪笑儂·劉鴻聲·兩派，也曾盛行於國內各大都市，在雖大體遵桂芬的唱法，惟彼能自編新戲，而允以快板·流水，見稱於時，所以他抵滬出演，確曾哄動一番。上海的伶界人向來對於南下的名伶，都很歡喜捧塲的；當笑儂隸丹桂第一臺時，有一次他唱「張松獻地圖」，居然派羅小寳·三麻子·馮志奎·三人分飾劇中不重要的角色劉·關·張，這當然更可號召觀衆，而增高笑儂身價了。此外還有劉鴻聲在大舞臺貼演「全本空城計」那一次，除梅榮齋是他帶的配角無甚奇特外，最怪的却要算趙如泉的反串老軍和姚俊卿的配演報子了。那一回因爲上座太好，不佞到塲又晚，故而買了兩張臺座，可以聽得格外淸楚。好在劉跛的戲無甚作工，聽曲者多半着重他的佳喉，幾十個臺座剛剛對準城樓，那眞是聽得千眞萬確了。</p>

<h3>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Urges the National People to Vigorously Implement the General Mobilization of the Spirit Program, Striving for Practicality and Diligence, Advocating Work Competition to Increase Production and Complete Construction, Enriching National Monthly Meetings to Promote Wartime Life, and Victory and Light are Already in Sight</h3>
<p>Chongqing. The 12th was the first anniversary of the National Spiritual Mobilization Movement. Chairman Chiang gave a radio address at 7 p.m., roughly stating: "Today is the 15th anniversary of the death of the Prime Minister. On this day last year, I announced the General Mobilization of the National Spirit Program to all compatriots, and told the military and civilians of the country to (implement spiritual mobilization in a concrete way to commemorate our Prime Minister). I further encourage my compatriots to be consistent inside and out, and not to regard this move as commonplace. We must use spiritual improvement, manifested in practical behavior, to complete our great cause of resistance and national construction. It has been a full year since this program was promulgated. During this year, although the progress of the war of resistance has been very arduous, and the changes in the international situation have been very slow, our military and civilians across the country have been able to remain as firm as mountains and as swift as thunder, united and persevering in their struggle. Finally, the Japanese have been dealt a head-on blow militarily, and all their cunning and insidious political strategies have failed to succeed. This past year has indeed laid the foundation for our final victory, and it is also that they have suffered a fatal blow from us, creating their decisive defeat. Our soldiers on the entire front line have sacrificed their lives, and compatriots at home and abroad have donated money and effort, enthusiastically serving the public. The compatriots in the occupied areas have not only worked hard to resist the enemy, but have also been able to contribute financially to the country. As for the wounded soldiers, they have returned to the battlefield, and the able-bodied young men have been competing to join the army. In addition, the enthusiasm of the people in the war zone to assist the army, and the efforts of the production elements to build, both in terms of regional distribution and quantitative planning, have doubled compared to before. Foreign observers, all those who have come to China to inspect, have all admitted that China has an inviolable power and the certainty of victory. And the basis of their comprehensive argument is that the Chinese people have realized that the Chinese national spirit has made more determined progress in the two and a half years of the war of resistance. When holding the Spiritual Mobilization Commemoration today, I cannot deny that my Spiritual Mobilization has had considerable gains. I cannot but express my gratitude to the compatriots in various places who are enthusiastic about promoting Spiritual Mobilization and implementing Spiritual Mobilization. However, I know that Spiritual Mobilization is not only a work of education and enlightenment, but also a work to be universally implemented. The function of Spiritual Mobilization is not only to invigorate our spirit in order to achieve victory in the war of resistance, but also to encourage each other and intensify our struggle during this wartime to create a new atmosphere of striving for progress and upward mobility, so that all the construction necessary for our national construction can be completed very quickly. Therefore, we cannot be complacent with the current small number of achievements. On the contrary, we must strictly examine ourselves and constantly encourage ourselves to expand our achievements and correct our current shortcomings. Everyone must still remember the three points specifically mentioned in the conclusion of the General Mobilization of the Spirit Program: (1) it must be thorough, (2) it must be lasting, and (3) it must be persevering. Now, if we honestly examine it, we will know that the implementation of Spiritual Mobilization has not yet achieved these three key points. What is called thorough? Thorough means to do it thoroughly inside and out. Everything instructed by the program and stipulated by the National Covenant must be fully accepted and fully implemented. We cannot take one part and ignore the other, nor can we only achieve passive conditions without implementing active conditions. What is called lasting? It means to continue to work hard without interruption. We cannot be enthusiastic for a short time and then give up, nor can we start something and not finish it. For example, our National Monthly Meeting is held once a month. If only the day of the monthly meeting is tense, then we will never receive any benefits. What is perseverance? It means to be firm and unyielding. Today, we are fully engaged in the war of resistance. The difficulties of wartime are increasing day by day, and the closer we get to victory and success, the more profound our hardships and difficulties will be. If we can only withstand ordinary difficulties, but cannot endure extraordinary hardships, cannot withstand oppression, and cannot withstand torment, then no matter how慷慨激昂we are, it cannot be considered as implementing Spiritual Mobilization. Now our national patriotic heart is very strong, our understanding of national righteousness is very widespread, and our belief in the war of resistance is very firm. However, there are really not many people who can fully achieve these three general points. I have carefully observed the reason, and it is really because our people still cannot reform our biggest shortcoming for many years, which is the so-called lack of practicality. I believe that one of the virtues most worthy of our emulation in modern countries is "practicality." Their research is really serious research, their learning is also really serious learning, their work is serious work, and their service is serious service. They are always full of a meticulous spirit at any time and any place, so their attitude is always positive and their work is always practical. Our ancestors were also like this. The so-called seeking truth from facts and striving for excellence are explanations of this spirit. But what is our general situation now? We accept an ideal very casually, and promise something very easily, but when it comes to implementation, we always muddle through. The atmosphere of (念念茲在茲) mentioned by our predecessors is rarely seen among our people now. May I ask, in the process of our war of resistance and national construction, the people have the responsibility of public service, the responsibility of education and propaganda, the responsibility of grassroots work, and even the general public originally has their own solemn tasks, but how many people can "心在事上"? How many people can be conscientious, not whitewash, not intermittent, and really and practically do it to the end? If this atmosphere is allowed to spread, even if we have very good methods, and even if there are some very loyal and striving soldiers and people, the mission we want to achieve will never be fully completed. This kind of atmosphere should have been corrected in peacetime, and it should be reformed in wartime, especially. If we still cannot develop a (practical) atmosphere in this wartime of life and death, and all our work is still irresponsible, then it is no different from everyone treating their personal life and death and the survival of the race as a child's play. In this way, is the future of the country and the nation not extremely dangerous? Therefore, on today's anniversary of Spiritual Mobilization, I ask our compatriots to be sure to put in a lot of effort to temper and cleanse themselves in the word (practical). We should start from here in promoting Spiritual Mobilization in the future. I believe that it is not difficult to (worship reality and eliminate falsehood) and cultivate a universal serious atmosphere. We only need to thoroughly reform the habit of aiming high and being fond of empty talk that has been accumulated over the years, to make propaganda not empty, plans not broad, and all work not divorced from reality. In this way, we will surely be able to persevere, be thorough, be persevering, be able to do it practically, be able to do it hard, and be able to do it tough, so that all our efforts will generate the greatest strength. From now on, if we want to invigorate the spirit of the people, we must first rectify the spirit of the people. If we want to popularize the general mobilization of the national spirit, we must first make the compatriots who have sworn the National Covenant really and practically do the very simple twelve clauses listed in the oath. At the same time, if we want to create a new atmosphere, we must first encourage new driving forces. If we want to complete a great cause, we must first call on our compatriots to start from concrete things that are close to ease. Based on these key points, I have specifically explained the above-mentioned matters to our compatriots as a guideline for our current promotion of Spiritual Mobilization and as a reference for our efforts to popularize Spiritual Mobilization. First, we must implement the program. There are five major points in the General Mobilization of the Spirit Program that we announced last year. There were originally provisions for implementation. Now we must further make them simple and concrete matters, so that the meaning of Spiritual Mobilization can be expressed in practical work. For example, if we want to correct the life of drunkenness and death, we must first ban opium and gambling, ban extravagance, advocate simplicity, practice thrift and savings. If we want to cultivate a vigorous and vigorous spirit, we must first pay attention to neatness and cleanliness, promote physical education and hygiene, and promote the healthy physique of the people. If we want to break the habit of苟且偷生, we must first vigorously implement work inspections, pay attention to being accurate and fast, advocate being active and striving, regard not being loyal to our duties as the greatest shame, and regard actively serving in the army as the greatest honor. If we want to break the attempt to be selfish and self-interested, then we must eliminate the evil atmosphere of貪汙欺僞, get rid of the crime of囤積居奇, and realize the creed of concentrating will and concentrating strength to cultivate the personality of modern citizens. If we want to correct the divergent and complicated thoughts, then we must first practice the oath of the supremacy of the country and the supremacy of the nation, advocate the habit of abiding by laws and strictly observing discipline, supervise each other, encourage each other, and make the general public respect the wartime national responsibilities and regard the dignity of wartime government orders as the same as the military orders in the army, and jointly achieve the goal of military first and victory first. If our compatriots can first achieve these few points, they will have achieved most of the requirements of our Spiritual Mobilization. Second, we must strengthen the economic struggle to break the Japanese's greatest conspiracy. The Japanese's military aggression is weakening day by day, and its political conspiracy has long failed. What it is still vigorously carrying out is economic exploitation, which is the plunder and destruction of our country's various economies, and even more so the oppression and deception of our compatriots in the occupied areas. Regarding this point, our compatriots across the country must be particularly vigilant, and must be united as one, regardless of men, women, old or young, must strive to destroy the transportation of inferior goods, report smuggling, and resist sales. I hope even more that the compatriots in the war zone will especially practice the National Covenant. If you can implement one point of the National Covenant thoroughly, then the date of your liberation can be brought forward by one day. Everyone must encourage each other and never compromise under any circumstances. Four articles in the National Covenant are especially important. These four articles are the greatest weapon to control people's lives. We must know that if we buy one more inch of a Japanese match, and use one more Japanese counterfeit bill, it is to help the Japanese kill one more of our compatriots and occupy one more piece of our land. To achieve benevolence and take righteousness, and to be威武不屈, we must express the spirit of our nation on this point. Second, we must advocate work competitions to increase production and complete construction. The war of resistance has reached today, and it is no longer entirely a military issue, and the real work of national construction must start from now. Therefore, we must encourage the courage to move forward, and raise the energy of our compatriots across the country to the highest limit to improve our work efficiency. Whether we are fighting, administering, engaging in education and training, or striving for production and construction, whether in the war zone or in the rear, all central, local, county, district, township, village organs, schools, factories, and farms must vigorously implement work competitions, stipulate competition standards, agree on competition units, and see who does more, who does better, who does faster, who does more accurately, whose goods are better, whose prices are cheaper, who wastes the least, who produces the most refined products, and even who saves, who is thrifty, who is clean, who is neat, who is most disciplined, and who is most able to help each other. In this way, through continuous competition and continuous research, if there are shortcomings, we will help each other to correct them. If there are strengths, we will learn from each other and promote them. On the one hand, we will improve our personal work interests as much as possible, and at the same time, we will improve the common achievements of our collective work day by day. In this way, not only will the wartime strength be enriched, but also the habits of因循愆慢will be eliminated. Fourth, we must enrich the National Monthly Meeting so that everyone can participate enthusiastically and be more meaningful. The holding of the National Monthly Meeting must be widely promoted, but the content of the National Monthly Meeting must be enriched. We must use the National Monthly Meeting to promote wartime life, and at the same time, we must use the National Monthly Meeting to actively train the people and organize the people. We must make the National Monthly Meeting a kind of gathering that awakens the people to struggle, promotes mutual assistance among the people, eliminates bad habits, trains the spirit of autonomy, and promotes production undertakings. The government is now vigorously carrying out construction on the one hand, and is about to implement the new county system and establish local autonomy on the other hand. Therefore, we must integrate the work of the National Monthly Meeting with the work of local autonomy, and try our best to encourage the participating compatriots to report on the local events and discuss practical improvement issues, so as to become an effective organization to promote various constructions, rather than a ritual that follows the story. This is what the compatriots who lead the monthly meeting in various places should pay more attention to and make good use of. The above-mentioned items are all based on the experiences and observations of the past year, in order to encourage our national aspirations, invigorate our national spirit, and point out our compatriots with essential and easy-to-implement methods. Finally, I want to tell my compatriots across the country that the entire situation of the war of resistance and the entire world situation are all about to enter a period of transformation from adversity to prosperity. Victory and light are already in front of us, but we should be more persevering and more striving, and we must not have the slightest gap or the slightest懈怠, so that the Japanese have a懈可擊and a隙可乘. We must establish a strict spiritual barrier, hone our sharp spiritual weapons,扎硬寨, 打死仗, shed blood and sweat, rush to the front, and never do anything that is beneficial to the Japanese and harmful to the country. We must work hard to do everything that is beneficial to the country and helps the war of resistance. Everyone should painfully remember that it has been fifteen years since the Prime Minister died. Our revolution has not yet succeeded, and the Japanese are still stealing our territory. How sad and ashamed should we be? But thinking of the Prime Minister's Three Principles of the People, we have been led to the path of light and victory. How excited are we? Today, on the first anniversary of Spiritual Mobilization, is the time for us to examine ourselves and encourage ourselves. How much responsibility have I fulfilled to the country? Are my spirit and life suitable for the spirit and life of the people in wartime? I hope everyone will reflect on themselves, correct themselves in time, invigorate themselves in time, understand etiquette, know shame, take responsibility, abide by discipline,竭忠盡智, and strive forward to shoulder the solemn mission left to us by the Prime Minister to carry out the revolution, build the country, and seek freedom and equality for China.

<h3>15th Anniversary of the Death of the Prime Minister, 1st Anniversary of the National Spiritual Mobilization, Central Government Holds Joint Commemoration, Chairman Lin Reports on the Spot: Commemorating the Prime Minister by Implementing the General Mobilization of the Spirit Program</h3>
<p>Chongqing. The 12th was the 15th anniversary of the death of the Prime Minister and the 1st anniversary of the National Spiritual Mobilization. The central government agencies jointly held a commemoration meeting. More than 600 people attended, including members of the Central Committee, heads of various departments and committees, and senior officials from party, government, and military agencies. It was led by Chairman Lin, and the ceremony was performed according to etiquette. He gave a report on the spot, titled (Commemorating the Prime Minister by Implementing the General Mobilization of the Spirit Program), roughly stating that today is the 15th anniversary of the death of the Prime Minister, and also the first anniversary of the National Spiritual Mobilization. When our war of resistance and national construction enters the third year, there are really many things to say to commemorate this day. We know that our Prime Minister, on the one hand, strived for the independence and freedom of the country throughout his life and laid the foundation for the country's复興. At the same time, he also created the profound Three Principles of the People as the supreme principle guiding the revolution. Looking at the Prime Minister's life, he is not only our country's revolutionary guide, but also the savior of all mankind. Therefore, the death of the Prime Minister cannot but be regarded as a major loss to our country and even the world. Fortunately, for more than ten years, comrades of our party and compatriots across the country have been united in sincerity and一致, under the leadership of Mr. Chiang Kai-shek, the President of our party, in order to implement the Prime Minister's志, we have continued to struggle and finally overcome all obstacles, completed the unification of the country, achieved the work of安內, and embarked on the road of national rejuvenation. This is also our greatest achievement since the death of the Prime Minister, which is worthy of special commemoration. However, this achievement is envied by others, and they do not hesitate to create incidents and launch a major</p>

<h3>The Key to Negotiations Between Finland and the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, it was widely rumored that the peace negotiations between Finland and the Soviet Union would be revealed yesterday. I sincerely wish for a complete and satisfactory resolution. However, as of midnight when this reporter was writing, there was still no good news. What is somewhat comforting is that the negotiations between the two sides are still ongoing, with the chances of success and failure being about equal.</p>
<p>Whether Finland and the Soviet Union make peace or continue the war is a matter between the two countries, but its impact on the international situation and future is far-reaching and subtle. Broadly speaking, any other country views the Finnish-Soviet peace or war as closely related to their own well-being. Analytically speaking, Britain and France hope that Finland will resolutely resist, or at least not sacrifice or concede, and achieve a glorious peace; Germany hopes that the Soviet Union will quickly win the war, or at least achieve some minor gains and end the war with negotiations as soon as possible; Italy's wishes are similar to those of Britain and France; Japan hopes that the Soviet Union will continue the war and deplete itself limitlessly; the United States and China hope that a glorious and just peace will be established between Finland and the Soviet Union. Such analysis may not be readily endorsed by Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and Japan, but our pure objective observation and analysis lead to this impression. Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and Japan have no ill will towards Finland, but each is acting in the best interests of their own country, and they wish that the Finnish-Soviet issue will trend in this direction.</p>
<p>The fact that Finland and the Soviet Union are currently negotiating and that the outcome is said to be half success and half failure is somewhat ambiguous. However, the content of the negotiations is not clear. Until the outcome of the negotiations is determined, who can predict it? Where does the key to peace or war lie? Some observers believe that Finland's peace or war depends on the extent of actual assistance from Britain and France, while others believe that British and French assistance depends on the convenience provided by Sweden and Norway, or on the Finnish Army Commander-in-Chief General Mannerheim's grasp and attitude towards the future of the war. Each argument has its basis. Based on my experience with the Sino-Japanese issue, I understand the Finnish-Soviet issue. I feel that the world's opinions are somewhat uneasy. The world's view of China's resistance: those who are hostile to China say that China's resistance is due to the assistance of Britain and the United States; those who slander China say that China's resistance is due to the coercion of the Communist Party; those who are well-intentioned but alienated say that China's resistance is due to the advocacy of General Chiang Kai-shek; all of these are wrong. It is due to the Japanese invasion, the entire Chinese nation's pursuit of survival, China's potential to sustain long-term resistance, and the confidence to strive for final victory. Applying this to the Finnish-Soviet peace talks: the Finnish government and people, and the Finnish military and civilians, are as loyal and brave as the Chinese; unfortunately, they are not blessed with favorable natural conditions, so objectively, they cannot sustain long-term resistance; subjectively, they openly express their need for assistance and lack the confidence to strive for final victory on their own; even with General Mannerheim's loyalty, integrity, wisdom, and courage, he can only say that if they cannot maintain the independence and freedom of the nation, they would rather fight to the last old man, woman, and child; this is limited and helpless, and not due to poor human planning. Where does the key to peace or war lie? It lies in the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>The Soviet nation has its unique and unyielding qualities. It can do whatever it wants, but there are things it will not do. It has its beliefs, but it can also assess the situation, give up unnecessary persistence. There are many examples, so I will not explain them in detail. Just taking Finland as an example: in military terms, it braved the difficulties of weather and terrain and made an attempt to penetrate and destroy. It encountered resistance, and its sharp edge was repeatedly blunted. Superficial people ridiculed it for being weak, but its absolute advantage is recognized by all knowledgeable people; if it were to unleash its majestic power, it would eventually control the entire territory of Finland; even if it were inevitably unsuccessful; it is now initiating peace talks without insisting on its military victory. This shows that it is not weak, so it does not lose its glory. In political terms, it initially fell into vain propaganda due to confusion, and was deceived by fellow travelers, thinking that one person could start a rebellion, widely call for support, and easily change the flag; later, knowing that this was not the case, it could not use military force as a backing to support it and complete it, using it as a tool, which it could value or despise today, and give or take as it pleased in the future; but now it is initiating peace talks and still treating the current Finnish government as its counterpart, without letting this transformation harm its so-called image. This is because it can release and收, without being bogged down or stagnant. The Soviet Union has the confidence to establish a nation, control policies autonomously, and knows that the root of its so-called image lies not in this, so it can abandon a puppet without harming its image. Only because the Soviet Union is like this, the question is whether the Soviet Union will disregard time and sacrifice, and eventually destroy Finland with military force? Or will it present Finland with acceptable conditions, so that Finland can still be an independent and free country, and from then on turn swords into plowshares. Will peace be realized then? On the issue of territory, Finland must be prepared to adapt to the wishes of the Soviet Union, without hindering its own survival, and make appropriate concessions; on the issue of sovereignty, it must maintain the integrity of its independence and freedom within its borders and never compromise. The establishment of a nation depends on the integrity of sovereignty as an absolute condition, while the size of territory is a relative phenomenon; loyal strategists seek complete security, and secondly, they would rather cede local territory than give up even a little bit of sovereignty. Giving up sovereignty means losing the nation; those who intend to destroy another nation must use violence to control the overall situation, and if they cannot avoid it, they will seek to control sovereignty without seeking territory. In short: the content of the Finnish-Soviet negotiations is unknown, and the success or failure of the future is unknown; what can be inferred is that the standard for whether Finland accepts the Soviet conditions is very simple, depending on whether the cession of land hinders its survival? Whether independence and freedom are preserved. What is unknown is: what are the Soviet conditions? Therefore, it is said that the key lies in the Soviet Union. The success or failure of the Finnish-Soviet negotiations is the key to peace or war between the two countries; peace or war between the two countries is the key to whether the European chaos expands or not, and whether the world situation gradually becomes stable or increasingly dangerous. The military aggression on a large scale. In order to survive, we are forced to resist. Therefore, as long as the aggression does not stop for a day, our resistance will not stop for a day. There is no room for hesitation in this. In short, the life of our Premier is to strive for the freedom and equality of the country. Therefore, we must continue to strive for the independence and freedom of our country until we can get it for a day. And our current resistance is to inherit the legacy of the Premier and complete the great cause of national independence and freedom. Therefore, only by resisting to the end can we be considered as believers of the Premier, and only then can we fulfill the significance of commemorating the Premier in the future. Our resistance is almost full two years, others are getting weaker and weaker as they fight, but we are getting stronger and stronger as we fight. Judging from the combat situation in the most recent year, their military offensive is hopeless. Now they can only intensify their political offensive and engage in the manufacture of puppet organizations to deceive their people. But in fact, apart from a few who are willing to be driven by them, I believe that all our loyal soldiers and civilians across the country will be able to see through their cunning schemes, strengthen unity, and jointly smash their ambitions and strive for final victory. Therefore, their attempt only reflects their hopelessness and will never damage us. Today, when we commemorate the Premier here, it is also the anniversary of the National Spiritual Mobilization. All of the Premier's instructions are the highest guiding principles for our resistance and nation-building, and what is stipulated in the National Spiritual Mobilization outline is based on the Premier's instructions to complete the important events of resistance and nation-building. In order to strive for final victory, in addition to恪遵the Premier's instructions, we must also practice the spiritual mobilization outline, especially the three goals in the outline, which must be achieved, because these three goals can be said to be the highest principles of all our future efforts. If we can貫澈 these three quantities of high principles, not only can the final victory be mastered, but also the great cause of nation-building and rejuvenation can be accelerated. (12th telegram)</p>

<h3>Sun Ke Advocates Close Cooperation with the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Chongqing, today is the memorial day of the Premier's death. Sun Ke, the son of Sun Yat-sen and the current President of the Legislative Yuan, delivered a speech, stating that it is absolutely necessary for the Chinese government to maintain close cooperation with the Soviet Union. According to Sun, the success of the Soviet Union's construction today can represent the realization of the Premier's Three Principles of the People, because the Soviet Union's construction expresses the ideals of nationalism, democracy, and socialism. Therefore, the more we admire the Soviet Union, the more we should believe in the Three Principles of the People, and the more we believe in the Three Principles of the People, the more we should study the Soviet Union and cooperate with the Soviet Union. He also said that there are more than 100 ethnic minorities in the Soviet Union, but their rights are all equal. Each ethnic group can preserve its inherent language and culture. The Premier's demand for nationalism lies in this. He also said that since the promulgation of the Stalin Constitution, the Soviet Union has become the most democratic country in the world. The Soviet Union's two and a half five-year plans have industrialized the entire country, and at the same time have made a reasonable solution to the distribution problem. Finally, Sun said that the Premier's theory is to liberate Taiwan, Korea, and all nations that are currently oppressed by Japan. (Associated Press, 12th telegram)</p>
<h3>Publication of the Premier's Pro-Soviet Testament</h3>

I hope that the Kuomintang can cooperate with you to complete the historical task of liberating China from the shackles of imperialism. I have ordered the Kuomintang to join hands with you forever. I firmly believe that you will be able to help us in the future as you have done in the past. I deeply believe that if China and the Soviet Union can unite as one, they will surely be able to achieve the mission of liberating the oppressed nations of the world." At the same time, the All-Russian Communist Party and the Presidium of the Soviet Union also sent a telegram to China today, expressing their condolences for the death of Sun Yat-sen, and said, "The Central Executive Committee of the All-Russian Communist Party firmly believes that the Kuomintang, under the glorious banner of Sun Yat-senism, will be able to completely defeat the imperialists and their agents in this struggle."

<h3>Japanese House of Representatives Budget Committee: Diet Members Question Various Diplomatic Cases</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 12th - The House of Representatives Budget Committee convened at 10:30 AM today, with diet members posing questions and answers regarding the following issues:</p>
<p>North China Development Problem</p>
<p>Mr. Kunio Morishita (Minseito) inquired about the progress since the establishment of the North China Development Company. Mr. Takao, Director of the East Asia Bureau of the Asian Development Board, replied that the North China Development Company was capitalized by Japan in cash or in kind. The company acts as a central entity comprehensively controlling national policy business companies. The telecommunications company, North China Transportation Company, and mining company, among others, under its control, are each responsible for developing resources. This year, subsidiary companies will begin developing the Datong coal mine, and recently the North China Electric Power Company was established to operate the electricity business. While the coal mines in North China are currently under the control of the Japanese army, consideration is being given to incorporating them into the Development Company for operation in the future.</p>
<p>Japan-Soviet Fisheries Problem</p>
<p>Mr. Ichiro Kono (Seiyukai Kuhara faction) inquired about the truth of reports that Japan's fishing grounds had been seized by the Soviet Union. Foreign Minister Arita replied that the stable and special fishing areas are still operated by Japan. As for other fishing areas, those that have reached their expiration dates are subject to annual bidding between Japan and the Soviet Union. Three of these fishing areas have been won by the Soviet side. However, if these areas were obtained through Soviet pressure or unfair bidding, Japan will lodge a protest.</p>
<p>Tianjin Problem</p>
<p>Mr. Kunio Morishita inquired about the content of the Anglo-Japanese negotiations regarding the Tianjin problem. The Foreign Minister replied that an agreement had been reached on the issue of public security, but that opinions on economic issues remain divided and are still under negotiation. However, he stated that he could not disclose the details. He added that the situation has changed considerably since the meetings last year, and this point is also being taken into consideration in the negotiations.</p>
<p>Bangkok Maru Incident</p>
<p>Mr. Oda asked what measures the government is taking in response to the Annam authorities' inspection of the Osaka Shosen Bangkok Maru in Haiphong and the confiscation of mail. The Foreign Minister replied that international law recognizes the right of belligerent nations to seize enemy documents unfavorable to them on neutral ships docked in their ports. However, while it is necessary to seize mail harmful to the country, harmless mail should not be confiscated. The government has instructed the authorities stationed in Annam to ensure that the country adheres to this principle.</p>
<p>Shanghai Postal Problem</p>
<p>Mr. Seizo Mogami (Minseito) inquired about the actual situation regarding postal supervision in Shanghai and North China. The Foreign Minister replied that postal supervision in the Shanghai and North China areas is being carried out by the military authorities and others, with the expectation that the postal service will not be used for espionage. Economic Minister Takao stated that the restoration of postal services is extremely necessary, and that recovery is gradually taking place in various locations in North and Central China since the outbreak of the incident. Furthermore, military postal services, the use of Japanese military scrip, and the preservation of the secrecy of correspondence are also proceeding smoothly.</p>
<p>U.S. Loan to China</p>
<p>Mr. Oda inquired about rumors that the U.S. government was considering approving a $20 million loan to the Chiang Kai-shek government, and asked the Foreign Minister for his opinion on this. Foreign Minister Arita replied that the U.S. had already approved a $20 million loan to Finland to promote exports. The proposed $20 million loan to China is primarily intended to stimulate U.S. exports and is not to be used for the export of military supplies, etc. However, the U.S. government's actions to assist Chiang Kai-shek are viewed with displeasure by Japan.</p>
<p>Japan-U.S. Trade Treaty</p>
<p>Mr. Oda inquired about the policy towards the United States after the abrogation of the Japan-U.S. trade treaty. Foreign Minister Arita replied that Japan hopes the United States will allow unobstructed trade and commerce, and hopes that the United States will adopt the same attitude. Mr. Oda inquired whether the United States, based on the Nine-Power Treaty, would convene a Nine-Power Conference to pressure Japan. He further added that Undersecretary Welles' mediation of peace in the European war fully demonstrates the U.S.'s policy of encirclement toward Japan. Foreign Minister Arita replied that he had not yet received information about the rumored Nine-Power Conference. He pointed out that a Nine-Power Conference had already been held before the incident, and Mr. Oda should be aware of the Japanese government's attitude toward it. Furthermore, he stated that he did not believe the United States intended to adopt a policy of encirclement against Japan. (12th, Domei News Agency)</p>
<p>Extraterritoriality Problem</p>
<p>Tokyo - Foreign Minister Arita stated in the House of Representatives today in response to questioning that Japan is prepared to relinquish extraterritorial rights in China but cannot do so "immediately upon or after the establishment of a new Chinese regime" because considerable preparation is necessary. The Japanese government hopes to relinquish extraterritorial rights as quickly as possible when the current situation permits. (12th, Reuters)</p>
<p>Anglo-Japanese Negotiations</p>
<p>Tokyo - During the House of Representatives meeting this afternoon, considerable attention was paid to reports that Britain had intercepted contraband in the Japanese Sea. One diet member questioned whether a Japanese ferry traveling between Busan, Korea, and Shimonoseki had been stopped by a British warship and boarded for inspection. Foreign Minister Arita replied that he had not received any such information. Another diet member inquired about the twelve German nationals being held in Hong Kong after the Asama Maru incident. The Foreign Minister replied that the government is continuing negotiations with the British government for their extradition, but that it is not yet the appropriate time to release any information about the progress of the negotiations. (12th, Reuters)</p>
<h3>Yonai to Reiterate Attitude Toward Wang; Abe May Visit China</h3>
<p>Tokyo - Prime Minister Yonai will issue a statement tomorrow clarifying the basic policy of cooperation between Japan and the new Chinese regime in response to the declaration issued by Wang Jingwei at 4:00 PM today.

<h3>Second Supplementary Budget to be Submitted to Cabinet on the 14th</h3>
<p>Tokyo - The Japanese government has scheduled a cabinet meeting on the 14th of this month to decide on the second supplementary budget for the Showa 15 fiscal year. This budget is expected to cover emergency measures for last year's drought, increased coal production, and merit-based rewards, totaling approximately 500 million yen. Until now, the budgets submitted to the Diet have all followed cabinet policy, but this supplementary budget is based on the current cabinet's independent policies and is therefore noteworthy. (12th, Domei News Agency)</p>
<h3>Japanese Suspicions About U.S. Attitude</h3>
<p>Tokyo - The Asahi Shimbun published an article this morning stating that the United States' policy toward Japan remains deeply unpleasant, citing the U.S. government's approval of a $20 million loan to China and Secretary of State Hull's consultation with 55 countries about the postwar world order, excluding Japan, as evidence. The Asahi Shimbun further stated that a related important issue is the U.S. government's denial of the establishment of a new central government in China. A faction in the United States believes that if such a new regime is established, the United States should convene a Nine-Power Conference to take active measures to deny this new situation. Should the United States take this action, Britain and France would support the United States. Therefore, Japan is maintaining calm while closely monitoring the future attitude and actions of the United States. (12th, Reuters)</p>
<h3>British Straits Settlements Iron Ore Exports to Japan Questioned in British House of Commons</h3>
<p>London - During today's session of the House of Commons, opposition Labour MP Edward inquired of the Colonial Office authorities how much iron ore from the British Straits Settlements had been sold to Japan in the twelve months before the outbreak of the war and since the outbreak of the war. The reply stated that between October 1938 and October 1939, a total of 1,862,612 tons of iron ore had been shipped from the Straits Settlements to Japan, but that the government has received no reports since October 1939. Edward further asked whether this large amount of iron ore being shipped to Japan was in the interests of the country. The Colonial Office authorities did not respond. (11th, Havas)</p>
<h3>Japanese Labor Shortage</h3>
<p>Tokyo (Air Mail) - At yesterday's session of the House of Representatives, Planning Board President Takeuchi replied to an inquiry from a diet member that, according to assessments for the current fiscal year, there is a 20% shortage of labor nationwide. The government will implement a labor mobilization plan in the next fiscal year, requiring the addition of 1.1 million workers. The government is considering recruiting Koreans and increasing the number of female workers domestically to fill the shortfall. (Havas)</p>
<h3>No Real Possibility of Closer Ties Between Soviet Union and Japan; Japanese Propaganda Aimed at Promoting Cooperation with Britain and the United States</h3>
<p>Washington - Despite the Japanese Foreign Ministry's statement yesterday regarding the resolution of disputes between the Soviet Union and Japan, government officials in contact with the [Washington] sources all believed last night that no large-scale rapprochement between the Soviet Union and Japan is possible. Observers here claim that the intention of the Japanese statement is to promote cooperation between Britain and the United States, threatening both countries with Japanese-Soviet cooperation. It is widely believed that Japan is attempting to use this threat to get the United States to recognize Japan's conquest of China, relax its embargo on Japan, and begin negotiations on a new Japanese-U.S. trade treaty. It is said that Tokyo hopes to use the threat of a Japanese-Soviet rapprochement to make Britain more willing to make concessions to Japan. Officials here also claim that private sources from within China have reported that Chiang Kai-shek will continue to receive significant assistance from the Soviet Union. They believe that the only possible way for Japan to end such assistance from the Soviet Union would be to offer the Soviet Union significant concessions. It is generally pointed out that Soviet-Japanese rivalry is not only ideological, but also historical and geographical. The conclusion of a trade treaty between the Soviet Union and Japan is not impossible, but that treaty is unlikely to include any conditions under which the Soviet Union would cease its aid to the Nationalist government, or any major concessions by the Soviet Union to Japan. Officials here indicated that the evidence cited in the Japanese Foreign Ministry statement for improvements in Japanese-Soviet relations are minor. The only noteworthy issue is the possibility of the Soviet Union concluding some kind of alliance with Japan, as the Soviet Union, when the Allies are at war, is deeply concerned about Japan attacking its rear. Therefore, the Soviet Union may want to keep Japan neutral. According to a statement released yesterday by a spokesman for the Japanese Foreign Ministry, the resolution of Japanese-Soviet problems is "making great strides," and discussions on issues such as the border of "Manchukuo," fishing rights, gasoline, and coal are improving. These negotiations are ongoing. The spokesperson stated, "General relations are improving. What must currently be emphasized is that definite and concrete results have not yet been obtained." (12th, United Press)</p>
<h3>U.S. Boxer Commits Murder</h3>
<p>New York - Cole, a young boxer who changed his name to Hans, was arrested in [New York] last December on suspicion of assassinating Engelberg, Secretary of the German Consulate in New York. He has now been convicted of murder and faces a maximum sentence of up to 11 years in prison. Engelberg was murdered at his home on December 7 last year. (12th, Reuters)</p>
<h3>Results of Soviet Far East Fisheries Auctions: Most Areas Awarded to the Soviet Union</h3>

A total of 24 fishing areas were auctioned off, with the Soviet Union winning 20 and Japan winning 4. Japan had previously leased 7 areas, losing 3 this time. Currently, the Soviet Union leases a total of 390 fishing areas in Soviet waters, while Japan leases 353. (12th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Soviet-Iranian Trade Agreement Initialed</h3>
<p>Moscow - Commercial negotiations between the Soviet People's Commissariat for Foreign Trade and the Iranian trade delegation have concluded, and the two sides provisionally signed a Soviet-Iranian trade and navigation agreement on the 10th. The signatories were Mikoyan, Chairman of the Soviet People's Commissariat for Foreign Trade, Alisyev, Soviet Trade Representative in Iran, Siyassi, Iranian Ambassador to the Soviet Union, and Siah, a representative of the Iranian government.

<h3>Finnish Delegation in Moscow Continues Peace Negotiations; Reportedly, Soviet Conditions Slightly Eased; Finnish Acceptance Subject to Parliamentary Vote</h3>
<p>Helsinki - After Finnish state representatives spoke again in Moscow at 2:00PM today with Soviet Minister of Foreign Affairs Molotov, it was said by informed sources that current Finnish-Soviet negotiations had not established any agreements or reached any decisions. The momentum for peace or war remains unresolved. Cabinet members and parliamentarians from both houses have maintained close contact with their representatives since the start of negotiations. According to political circles here, the three most delicate issues in the current negotiations are: (1) the building of a railway from the port of Viipuri northeastward directly to the Soviet border; (2) the political and military system of Finland after the war; (3) the Hanko Peninsula issue.</p>
<p>In addition, Prime Minister Ryti's presence in Moscow since the 7th of this month has only just been known to the Finnish people this morning, which has been perceived as strange. It is commonly said that although negotiations are in progress, frontline battles and the arbitrary bombing by Soviet aircraft continue as before, which is especially baffling. (11th, Havas)</p>
<p>Stockholm - Regarding the peace talks between Finland and the Soviet Union, various newspapers here recently reported that the Soviet Union originally demanded that Finland cede the port of Petsamo, the Hanko Peninsula, and the port of Viipuri. It is now rumored that they are prepared to abandon this demand, and only require Finland to cede to the Soviet Union the areas occupied by the Red Army in the Karelian Isthmus and the Audru Island. (12th, Havas)</p>
<p>London - Regarding the peace talks between the Soviet Union and Finland, financial circles here generally believe that Finland may not make any decisions for several hours. This is because the conditions proposed by the Soviet Union must first be accepted by the Finnish cabinet, and then approved by parliament, before they can be considered accepted by the entire Finnish nation. Furthermore, General Mannerheim, commander-in-chief of the country's army, knows best whether the country can continue to resist. His opinion is also a force to be reckoned with. (12th, Havas)</p>
<p>Paris - Diplomatic circles here recently stated that the peace terms proposed by the Soviet government to Finland seem to have been substantially reduced. The intention behind this is to conclude an agreement with the country as soon as possible. The reasons for this are as follows: (1) Leningrad is very close to the war zone, and residents in the area are very aware of the war situation. It is feared that they may not be able to maintain their high morale for long; (2) Britain and France have a real possibility of actively intervening in the Finnish-Soviet war. This is clearly demonstrated by British Prime Minister Chamberlain's statement in the House of Commons today that if Finland applies for aid, Britain and France will continue to provide assistance regardless of the attitudes of other countries. Not only that, but the Soviet Union has failed to achieve a swift victory since using troops against Finland, and its position vis-à-vis Germany has been greatly weakened. In order to salvage its technical and industrial resources, it had to sign a cooperation agreement with Germany, authorizing the country to organize, control, and oversee Soviet production. In reality, the Soviet authorities may not welcome this agreement, which will soon become apparent. In addition, although Germany voluntarily abandoned its position in the Baltic coastal states last September and October, it has recently sought to restore it, given the Red Army's long and unsuccessful campaign. Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky recently contacted the British Foreign Office authorities, hoping that Britain would mediate the war between Finland and the Soviet Union. This move is of great significance, as it shows that the Soviet Union is unwilling to ask Germany to mediate due to fears of paying too high a price. Political circles also say that, given the news today that the Soviet conditions for Finland are far more lenient than those proposed before the outbreak of the war, the country's desire to quickly conclude a peace is already obvious.</p>
<p>According to news from the Scandinavian peninsula, the Soviet Union no longer insists on Finland ceding the port of Viipuri, but only requests that the two sides demarcate a new border. In other words, the border will be extended from Lake Ladoga, through the Mannerheim Line, to the city of Vuoksi, and then follow the line currently occupied by the Red Army to a point between the Finnish city of Summa and the port of Viipuri. As such, a portion of the Mannerheim Line may still belong to Finland. Furthermore, it is reported that the Soviet Union's demands for the ports of Petsamo in northern Finland and the Hanko Peninsula in the south have also been eased compared to before. (11th, Havas)</p>
<h3>Finnish Parliament Meets Through the Night</h3>
<p>Helsinki - After meeting for several hours last night, the Finnish Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee immediately convened a plenary session of Parliament, which had not adjourned by midnight. Members of all political parties and representatives of the General Staff participated in the meeting, which was held not in Helsinki but in "a secret location" under strict protection. (12th, Huitong Telegraph)</p>
<h3>Britain Sent Note to Finland Offering All Possible Assistance; Prime Minister Chamberlain Responded to Diet Member Questions, Stating Assistance to Finland Will Not Violate Treaties</h3>
<p>London - Reuters has learned that the British Prime Minister Chamberlain has, on multiple occasions, sent Finland notes stating all possible assistance. This note arrived in Helsinki before the Finnish delegation departed for Moscow to discuss peace terms. This morning, responsible officials stated that no reply has been received from the Finnish government regarding this matter. According to London, the Finnish delegation is still in Moscow. (12th, Reuters)</p>
<p>London - During this afternoon's meeting of the House of Commons, Prime Minister Chamberlain commented on the Finnish issue, stating that "Any assistance that we provide to Finland must be consistent with the obligations we have accepted under the Covenant of the League of Nations. This is certain." Opposition Labour MP Kirkwood interjected, "Isn't what we're doing no different from fighting the Soviet Union?" The Prime Minister replied, "As of now, it has not reached that point." Opposition Labour MP Sloan asked, "Is the British government prepared to send troops to Finland and violate Norwegian neutrality?" The Prime Minister replied, "Regarding this, I have already made a statement, and there is nothing more to add." He then replied to an inquiry from Opposition Labour leader Major Attlee, saying, "Regarding the current situation between the Soviet Union and Finland, I have no reliable information to share with you at this time. The rumor that the Soviet Union has requested Britain to mediate is not entirely accurate, but Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky has presented several conditions to Foreign Secretary Halifax, requesting that the British government convey them to Finland. The government believed it was inappropriate to do so, and that is the real situation." (11th, Havas)</p>
<h3>U.S. Not Involved in Soviet-Finnish Negotiations; Hull Issues Statement, Only Observes</h3>
<p>Washington - U.S. Secretary of State Hull stated yesterday that U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Steinhardt has been in contact with Soviet officials and the Finnish delegation in Moscow, but has not been mediating the Soviet-Finnish conflict. The purpose of the Ambassador's actions is to ensure that the United States fully understands the progress of the Soviet-Finnish negotiations. Steinhardt and the U.S. government have not engaged in or interfered in the negotiations between the two countries. He has not received any news that representatives from the two countries are holding negotiations at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow. Officials here believe that the above news may be due to Steinhardt's important role in the Moscow mediation movement. (12th, United Press)</p>
<p>Washington - The White House press briefing yesterday was not attended by President Roosevelt due to a slight cold. The President's Secretary, O'Leary, took an evasive stance when answering questions about the Soviet-Finnish negotiations. He stated that he had announced last week that the United States was in a position of observer regarding the Soviet-Finnish negotiations, and that there were no new developments. O'Leary went on to say that the State Department is the agency responsible for answering this question. The State Department also remained silent yesterday, but U.S. newspapers reported that the location of the Soviet-Finnish negotiations was the U.S. Embassy in the Soviet Union. Political figures here also believe that Britain's activities are actually more active than officially acknowledged, but the State Department only stated that U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Steinhardt was not involved in the Soviet-Finnish negotiations. The press here anticipates that the U.S. government will issue a statement soon. (12th, Huitong Telegraph)</p>
<h3>Sweden Reiterates Policy to Ensure Neutrality; Seeks Only Swedish-Finnish Common Interests; Has Had No Contact with Germany</h3>
<p>Stockholm - Swedish Foreign Minister Gunther met with a Reuters reporter last night and denied that Sweden had issued any advice to Finland. He stated that Sweden had had no contact with Germany during these negotiations and had not advised the Finnish government in any way. When asked if there was a possibility of Sweden providing guarantees for Finland if peace could be achieved, Gunther replied that this issue had not yet arisen. Gunther continued to describe Anglo-Swedish relations, saying that they have always been extremely cordial and remain so to this day. He hopes that they will remain unchanged in the future. Sweden is very surprised by the misunderstandings and distortions of Swedish policy overseas. Sweden's goal is to do its utmost to serve the interests of both Finland and Sweden. The situation has shown us that the best way to help Finland is to maintain our neutrality and do our best to supply necessary materials and volunteers. When asked if Sweden had considered preventing its iron ore from being transported to belligerent countries in order to ensure its neutrality, Gunther replied that such a move would likely have the opposite effect. Sweden's best guarantee is to continue normal trade with all parties. (12th, Reuters)</p>
<p>Stockholm - Today's conservative "Dagens Nyheter" reported that if Finland rejects the Soviet conditions, Sweden will begin a Spanish-style "non-intervention" and send complete units, to which Germany will likely not object. We must make it clear to the Western European powers that their intervention will not be tolerated by Sweden or Norway. We do not want Scandinavia and Finland to become a battlefield for Allied conflict in the north. If Finland rejects the Soviet demands, the Swedish government will immediately change, allowing more military personnel to participate, as only the leaders of national defense can make the necessary decisions.

<p>Bombay: The Indian National Congress plans to convene an important meeting, hoping to decide whether the party should allow cooperation with Britain in the current war against Germany, or insist on first granting India independence before allowing cooperation. Final preparations for the meeting are now nearing completion. The meeting is nominally only "an ordinary routine annual meeting" and will be held in Lanjiahe, in the province of Rajputana in northwestern India, and will open on Friday, March 15. The most important event of the discussion is that the British government must only allow India dominion status after the end of the war. The outcome of the meeting is absolutely unpredictable. The leaders of the party are now maintaining strict silence, but it is an open secret that Gandhi is at least willing to avoid any irreparable split with the British authorities. According to all sources, the meeting will form a struggle between conservatives and the extreme left-wing leaders in the party, and Gandhi will try to balance the two factions and prevent either from being overthrown. The conservatives believe that if the Congress Party makes excessive demands, it will only harm itself and gain nothing. If they are open and honest, they may gain something. Rather than risk losing everything by being too greedy, it is better to ensure that they can gain a little. They regard themselves as realists. A newspaper in this area, which has long been regarded as the mouthpiece of this faction, recently published an article that did not focus on independence, but stated that the Congress Party is eager to achieve political progress. Many believe that Gandhi is in favor of this reasonable approach. The left wing, led by Nehru, strongly opposes this view. It is said that the party believes that now is not the time for the Congress Party to completely submit. Nehru once declared that what the Congress Party demands is a clearly defined status, which is independence. It is wrong to believe that Gandhi or anyone else would advocate anything less than this. Nehru also made intimidating remarks, saying that the young people of Western countries are now dying in droves to deal with their problems, and that India is now prepared to face that hell in order to solve its own problems. Between the two factions, there is a relatively powerful central group that advocates demanding only nominal independence for India now. The leader of this faction told a Reuters reporter that this is close to idealizing India, which will not break away from Britain, but should be allowed the right to break away in order to appease our extremists. Whatever changes may occur in the future, we should avoid doing anything at this stage that is considered to compromise with British imperialism. Muslim leaders, who are responsible for their 90 million co-religionists, are becoming increasingly uneasy. Their most urgent concern is that whatever final decision is made regarding India's status now, it must have adequate provisions so as to not place Muslims under the control of the Congress Party, as the Congress Party is nothing more than an Indian-Hindu group. Jinnah, Chairman of the All-India Muslim League, recently told visitors in a near-grieving tone that we Muslims are prepared to put forward concrete proposals for the future constitution of India to replace abstraction, but the Governor-General or the British government has not expressed this desire. The two are now clearly busy persuading Gandhi to descend from idealism to realism, so they have no time to care about Muslims. However, I must emphatically declare that Muslim India can never agree to its future being decided by the Gandhi faction, nor can it accept the final decision of Great Britain. We must eventually appeal to the one and only judge that we consider to be the best. (Reuters dispatch from the 12th)</p>

<h3>Hong Kong Overseas Chinese Schools Increase Tuition Fees under the Pretext of Complying with New Regulations. The Most Common Increase is 20 Percent. Poor Students Find it Difficult to Cope and are Forced to Drop Out</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong Correspondence) Many Overseas Chinese schools here find it difficult to comply with the new education regulations promulgated by the Hong Kong government. They recently jointly requested the education authorities to make improvements. They are now preparing to petition Hong Kong Governor Sir Geoffrey Northcote. The petition is still being drafted. However, while this move is actively underway, most Overseas Chinese schools have increased their tuition fees.</p>
<p>Poor Students Forced to Drop Out</p>
<p>According to investigations, the most schools increasing tuition fees are in Hong Kong. Apart from some larger schools, such as Fang Lin, Hong Kong Overseas Chinese, Southwest, Guanghua, Lingdao, Zhixing, South China, and Meifang, the smaller ones have all increased their tuition fees. For example, at a large girls' secondary school kindergarten on Caine Road, tuition fees for one semester have increased from $18 to $22. Primary schools charge fees according to grades 1-2, 3-4, and 5-6, with increases of $2 in each case. For junior high and senior high, the former increases from $32 to $36, and the latter from $36 to $40. Smaller schools mostly increase tuition fees by $10 per year, that is, $5 per semester. In general, the most common increase is 20 percent. Some schools, which in the past widely recruited students or gave preferential treatment to the poor, often set up half-fee student places. Now, it has been found that these schools have cancelled the preferential treatment originally enjoyed by half-fee students and require full fees to be paid. Otherwise, they must drop out. Since these students are poor, they find it difficult to cope for a while, and many are forced to drop out. In addition, some schools did not state that they would increase tuition fees when students registered. It was only when paying the fees that they learned that the school had raised tuition fees. Parents are mostly dissatisfied with this.</p>
<p>Tuition Fees Increased Despite Simple Equipment</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese school tuition fees are mostly not uniform, but the amount of fees charged depends on the size of the school. Schools with simple equipment naturally charge less than those with more substantial facilities. However, at present, the fees charged by these schools with simple equipment are equal to those of better schools, and those who want to transfer are unable to do so because all schools are full. They are forced to continue studying at their old schools.</p>
<p>Other Reasons for Increasing Tuition Fees</p>
<p>According to reporter investigations, the reason for increasing tuition fees at Overseas Chinese schools is the excuse of the new education regulations promulgated in Hong Kong, which require schools to make many reforms and increase their burden. Therefore, tuition fees are increased to make up for it. Another reason is the increase in rent. However, according to the reporter's inquiry with several leaders in the education sector in Hong Kong, it was learned that the new education regulations recently promulgated by the Hong Kong government have not yet caused schools to suddenly increase their burden. In fact, the education authorities have not strictly implemented the new regulations. If schools use this as an excuse to increase tuition fees, it seems inappropriate to increase the burden of education fees on Overseas Chinese. Moreover, the outcome of the request to the Hong Kong government to improve the new regulations is still unknown. It would be premature to suddenly increase tuition fees at this time.</p>
<h3>Middle School Student Life Guidance (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Wang Maozu</p>
<p>(Kunming Correspondence) Mr. Dian Cuncun, who studied abroad and returned to China, has served as a professor at famous universities in China and the principal of provincial middle schools for many years, and is currently the director of a branch of the Central Political School, recently wrote an article on "Middle School Student Life Guidance," in which he made earnest instructions on the selection of middle school student life guidance personnel, psychological characteristics, and guidance methods, etc., which are of great value. Therefore, I have specially recorded the original text as follows: The middle school students of today will be the backbone of rebuilding the country and the nation in the near future. According to education statistics from five years ago, middle school students in our country account for 12 out of every 10,000 people in the country. After deducting those who drop out midway, I am afraid that it is less than one in a thousand. In other words, each middle school student has to shoulder the responsibility of leading 1,000 people. Of course, there are also university students above them, but university and college students must also come from middle schools. Therefore, the guidance of middle school students is related to the lifeline of the country, and it is extremely important. Since the War of Resistance, organizations such as the Three People's Principles Youth League have taken middle school students as their main target. Spiritual mobilization also relies on the service of the Youth League as the backbone of promotion. It is hoped that on this arduous journey of resisting the war and building the country, a large number of healthy, brave, and enterprising new youth will be produced to create a new life for the nation. What is described in this article is limited to life guidance within middle schools.</p>
<p>First, the selection of instructors</p>
<p>Life guidance in middle schools should of course be undertaken by teachers, with the tutor as the central person in charge. The selection of tutors should first be those who firmly believe in the Three People's Principles and have correct political views, second, those who are willing to be considerate of young people and study the emotions of young people, and third, those who teach homework and can gain the belief of students, often able to enlighten students with good suggestions and correct understanding, and fourth, in short, those who can lead by example, are not afraid of being tedious, and have a sincere, enthusiastic, and contagious attitude. If all four of the above items can be fully prepared, it can be said that they are the best teachers in the country.</p>
<p>Second, the characteristics of psychological development of middle school students</p>
<p>Since the object of guidance specified in this topic is middle school students, then we must first have a review and research on the physical and mental development of middle school students as the basis for guidance methods. Middle school students range in age from twelve or thirteen to twenty years old, with a large difference among them. High school and junior high school student activities must be guided separately due to differences in experience level and stage of physiological development. However, the concentrated trend of its development is the period of adolescence, and drastic changes have taken place in the body and spirit. What kind of personality to develop is at this juncture. Generally speaking, their psychological characteristics are: (1) A flourishing of emotions. The life of the adolescent period can be said to be the life of emotion. Although the intellectual aspect is also very advanced, it is often obscured by emotional impulses. Their sympathy is extremely developed, loyal to the group, loving to the weak, worshiping heroes, loving to fight injustice, and loving to be praised. Because emotions are too strong, they are very enthusiastic when they encounter things of interest, and after hitting a wall, they will be depressed and frustrated. If they get inappropriate comfort or relief, the strong tend to go astray, and the weak become numb and decadent, which must be carefully considered. (2) "Active ideals." Their understanding of the objective world is certainly insufficient, but their impulse to seek knowledge is extremely strong, and they imagine and test everything at the same time, forming various ideals in their minds. Behind this, emotions are active. In the real world, life is full of contradictions and is restricted. The nature of ideals in adolescence is extremely fluid and active. Coupled with the strength of curiosity, they can follow the wind after hearing an inspiring speech. As for sacrificing their lives, or getting suggestions from novels, they can indulge in confusion and live that wandering life. In the past, there were young people who wrote after reading "Dream of the Red Chamber." A few years ago, newspapers reported the fact that three or several middle school students went to Kunlun Mountain to practice Taoism together. It can be said that the life of adolescence is rich in literary and religious qualities. (3) "Group formation and hostility." Young people like small groups, such as "Brotherhood," "Ten Sisters," etc., and are hostile and competitive with other groups. Based on this point, the training of British middle school ball fields can cultivate fair competition and political morality. If it is used for other purposes, it will become a tool of political struggle. We should expand this concept of small unity into a large unity and guide the competitive behavior of hostility to cooperative competition. Also, young people like to show off and love to wear tall hats, which can prove the development of self-awareness. Because they are inexperienced, they do not consider the advantages and disadvantages of doing things, and often go beyond the norms, so they should be given appropriate restrictions from time to time during agitation. (4) "Tendency to commit crimes." Since young people's emotional impulses and their remaining energy are very strong, if there is no appropriate opportunity to vent and release them, they will feel depressed and seek ways to satisfy themselves, and they will rush out. In some incidents, the motive is not bad, but because they do not know how to deal with it, they have committed illegal acts. In the United Kingdom and the United States, there are juvenile courts to carry out rehabilitation.</p>
<h3>The Cultural World Yesterday Mourned Zhuang Baiyu, Who Compiled China's First Elementary School Textbook</h3>
<p>Mr. Zhuang Baiyu of Wujin was an advanced figure in China's education world. In the 31st year of the Guangxu reign of Emperor Dezong (1905), he established Guanying Elementary School and Youyou Girls' School in Wujin. The following year, he operated Shanggong Elementary School in this city. At that time, people were unenlightened. Mr. Zhuang, together with wise men, founded speech clubs, book reading clubs, anti-foot-binding societies, and private school reform societies, calling out and running around to enlighten the people. Later, he served as an editor at the Commercial Press and held important positions in the China Vocational Education Society and the Jiangsu Education Association. China's first elementary school Chinese textbook was also compiled by Mr. Zhuang in cooperation with Jiang Zhuzhuang, Zhang Jusheng, and Gao Mengqie (i.e., the Latest Chinese Textbook). He also compiled Simplified Textbooks and Republican Textbooks. Recently, Mr. Zhuang died of a chronic illness in Shanghai at the age of 62. People from the cultural and educational circles of this city held a memorial service at Lake Society at 2:30 pm yesterday. More than 300 people from all walks of life, the Commercial Press, including Jiang Zhuzhuang, Lu Gaoyi, Xu Jiqi, and others attended. The layout of the auditorium was very solemn and solemn. A portrait of Mr. Zhuang was hung in the center, and there were many elegiac couplets and white banners presented by relatives and friends. Mr. Li, the deputy manager of the Commercial Press, presided over the sacrifice. Jiang Zhuzhuang reported on his life deeds, and Pan Wen'an, Huang Jingwan, and others gave speeches one after another.</p>
<h3>Second Middle Vocational Supplementary Free Class</h3>
<p>The Second China Vocational Supplementary School, located at 330 Beijing Road, recently, in view of the fact that young people are ambitious to study but feel that it is economically and time-wise impossible, has specially added morning and evening classes. The morning class is from 6:00 am to 7:00 am, and the evening class is from 5:30 pm to 6:20 pm. Only a miscellaneous fee of two yuan is charged. The level and subjects are optional.</p>

<h3>Finance: Chinese Merchants Aggressively Buying Forward Foreign Exchange</h3>
<p>The foreign exchange market saw no change in the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) official rates. The unofficial market for British and American currencies was calm in the morning but changed suddenly in the evening. The opening saw further narrowing of overseas US and British exchange rates by one cent, continuing the trend of British currency being flat and US currency being tight. The rates were initially quoted at 4 pence 140625 and 6 yuan 65625. After the opening, the situation was stagnant. Although foreign firms, speculators, and Japanese firms successively bought in, the supply was still sufficient, so there was no movement for half a day. The situation only began to stabilize in the afternoon. At 2:15 PM, a Chinese bank first aggressively bought US dollars for April delivery. At the same time, speculators also became active, and Japanese firms continued to purchase, causing the market to suddenly soften. Fortunately, the British pound was supported by HSBC, so the tightening trend was slight. By the close, the British pound was at 4 pence 125, and the US dollar was at 6 yuan 59375, the tightest price of the day. As a result, compared to the previous day, the British pound softened by 0.015625 and the US dollar narrowed by 0.09375. The futures market showed a slight convergence with the spot market.</p>
<p>Morning Initially Calm</p>
<p>The morning began calmly, with London's long-term rates each narrowing by 25, the New York silver price remaining flat, and the London gold price remaining stable. Exchange rates for British currency against US, French, and other currencies were all flat. The US dollar continued to fall by one cent against the British pound, with no change against Shanghai, and a slight drop against the French franc. The Central Bank's official rates were unavailable due to the anniversary of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's death, and the bank was closed as usual. The opening selling prices for spot rates were 4 pence 40625 for the British pound and 6 yuan 65625 for the US dollar, which were flat and 0.03125 tighter respectively compared to the previous close, due to the narrowed exchange rates. After the opening, foreign firms bought in, with outside firms buying a small amount of spot British pounds at 4 pence 140625, a very flat situation. HSBC announced that the official rates would not change. Later, a Chinese bank sold British pounds for April delivery at 4 pence 125 on behalf of a Hong Kong firm, while a Shanghai Chinese bank sold US dollars for April delivery to a peer bank at 6 yuan 59375, and a money exchange business sold Dehua US dollar bills at 6 yuan 75. Supply and demand were balanced, with little change. Soon, speculators also bought US dollars for the current month at 6 yuan 625 from outside firms, followed by a Japanese firm purchasing US dollars for April delivery at 6 yuan 5625 from a certain bank. The situation continued to be stagnant and flat. However, later in the session, a speculator wanted to buy US dollars for the current month, but outside firms were unwilling to sell at higher prices, so they were unsuccessful. Until the close, spot prices for both the British and US currencies were the same as the opening prices. Futures, however, saw the British pound flat and the US dollar slightly softer, with 6 yuan 625 difficult to close for the current month and only 6 yuan 53125 for the following month.</p>
<p>Afternoon Suddenly Tightens</p>
<p>The market initially opened steadily in the afternoon. Later, because a Chinese bank took the lead in aggressively buying US dollars for April delivery, followed by Japanese firms and speculators also actively trading in futures, the market suddenly tightened. It is estimated that a Chinese bank bought US dollars for April delivery from Chase and other foreign firms at 6 yuan 53125 and half a yuan. At the same time, speculators also bought US dollars for April delivery at 6 yuan 50 from Youli Bank, and a Japanese firm bought British pounds for the same month at 4 pence 078125 from a foreign firm. At the same time, foreign firms also bought spot British pounds at 4 pence 125 from HSBC, so the tightening trend for the British pound was slight. By the close, the British pound was at 4 pence 125, and the US dollar was at 6 yuan 59375. British pounds for the current month were at 4 pence 125, and US dollars were difficult to close at 6 yuan 59375. British pounds for the following month were at 4 pence 078125, and US dollars were at 6 yuan 50. As a result, compared to the previous day, spot British pounds tightened by 0.015625, and US dollars softened by 0.09375. Futures saw the British pound flat and the US dollar narrow by 0.0625.</p>
<p>Hong Kong US Dollar Also Narrows</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 12th (Tuesday) - The exchange market opened flat today. Spot British pounds were unchanged, and forward rates eased by 0.03125 to 1 shilling 2 pence 84375. Spot US dollars tightened by 0.0625 to 23 yuan 875. Spot Shanghai currency fell slightly by 2.5 cents to 357 yuan 2.5 cents. Spot Japanese currency also narrowed by 2.5 cents to 101 yuan 2.5 cents. At 11:30 AM, the market was stable, with British and Japanese currencies unchanged. Spot US dollars continued to tighten by 0.0625 to 23 yuan 8125, and spot Shanghai currency continued to fall by 2.5 cents to 357 yuan. The market softened slightly at noon, with spot US dollars narrowing further by 0.0625 to 23 yuan 75. At 2:30 PM in the afternoon, the market opened softly, with no change in any currency.</p>
<p>Tianjin Currencies All Rise</p>
<p>Tianjin, 12th (Tuesday) - The exchange market opened flat this morning. Spot British pounds eased by 0.03125 to 3 pence 75, spot US dollars rose by 0.0625 to 6 yuan 0625, and Shanghai currency fell by 1 yuan to 109 yuan 50 cents. "United Notes" in the gray market were valued at 1 yuan 50 cents, at 101 yuan 50 cents.</p>
<h3>A Certain Bank Aggressively Enters: Gold Market Rises Again; Approaching the 4,900 Yuan Mark</h3>
<p>Yesterday's unofficial market for spot gold continued to rise, as speculators became more eager to buy, and Hong Kong buyers remained strong. It was also rumored that a certain Chinese bank was also buying in the market. The tightening foreign exchange rate in the afternoon further encouraged buyers to move forward, and the rising momentum was strong, continuing until the close, rising by 92 yuan. For the day's trading, the morning opened with a rise of 7 yuan, to 4,800 yuan, due to the slightly tighter US dollar. Subsequently, silver shop buyers came in to sell, briefly returning to 4,797 yuan, but Hong Kong buyers suddenly became active. Certain gold shops and retail investors also rushed to buy in, and soon a certain money exchange business also bought on behalf of a local buyer, reaching as high as 4,830 yuan. Before long, as retail investors were willing to sell to realize profits, and gold shops sold again, the price briefly fell by more than ten yuan. Certain money exchange businesses took the opportunity to buy again, so the noon close was still at 4,815 yuan. In the afternoon, because a certain money exchange business continued to aggressively buy, and securities buyers were also eager to enter, coupled with the sudden tightening of the foreign exchange rate, and retail shorts were forced to cover their positions, although a certain gold shop had initially sold off, it unexpectedly switched to buying near the close. Therefore, by the evening close, the high point of 4,885 yuan was reached. The day's trading was active with 2,500-2,600 taels changing hands. Gold jewelry rose by 10 yuan, while customs gold, etc., remained flat.</p>
<p>Spot Rose by 92 Yuan</p>
<p>From the morning, because of the rumor of a slightly weaker US dollar, sentiment remained strong. Certain gold shops and securities buyers bid up prices and bought in. The opening price was 7 yuan higher, with a gold shop buying 50 taels from a silver shop at 4,800 yuan. Shortly after, silver shop buyers and cash shops sold, causing the price to fall by 3 yuan. A cash shop sold 20 taels to a securities buyer at 4,797 yuan. Subsequently, Hong Kong buyers suddenly became active, entrusting certain gold shops and silver shops to buy in on their behalf. At the same time, money exchange businesses also followed suit on behalf of retail investors, causing the price to immediately jump up, soon reaching beyond the 4,810 yuan mark. At that time, certain money exchange businesses also aggressively bought, and the rising momentum was strong, jumping another ten yuan. A gold shop bought 30 taels from silver shop buyers at 4,830 yuan. Because certain gold shops realized profits and sold off again, and retail longs also slightly liquidated, and at that time buyers' appetite turned stagnant, the price fell by 14 yuan. A cash shop sold 50 taels to a money exchange business at 4,816 yuan. After that, a certain money exchange business bought again, and certain securities buyers also bought in, so the price slowly rose again, reaching as high as 4,825 yuan by the close. The afternoon was even more robust, with the opening price 5 yuan higher. A silver shop bought 30 taels from a securities buyer at 4,830 yuan. Before long, a certain money exchange business and Hong Kong buyers aggressively bought in, and securities buyers also bought in, and at that time the foreign exchange rate was promising, rising another 50 yuan. Securities buyers bought a total of 100 taels from silver shops and silver shop buyers at 4,880 yuan. At that time, a certain gold shop suddenly aggressively sold off, pulling back 24 yuan. Securities buyers traded 30 taels among themselves at 4,856 yuan. Later, because the US dollar continued to tighten, buying momentum rose again. A certain gold shop suddenly stopped selling and aggressively bought in. At the same time, certain money exchange businesses and securities buyers aggressively bought again, raising the price by another 29 yuan. A silver shop bought 50 taels from a money exchange business at 4,885 yuan as the evening closing price. As a result, compared to the previous day, the price rose sharply by 92 yuan. The price fluctuated by 88 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of cash shops' own-brand gold was several yuan higher based on the spot price, while the buying price was reduced by 20 yuan. The current standard gold price was more than 50 yuan lower than the official price, with little trading.</p>
<p>Gold Jewelry Raised by 10 Yuan</p>
<p>The initial exchange price of gold jewelry from major silver shops was still 485 yuan per tael. By 10:30 AM, it was raised by 5 yuan. At 4:00 PM in the afternoon, it was raised by another 5 yuan. As a result, the major silver shops changed the exchange price to 495 yuan. New silver shops had the same price as the previous price, with the buying price reduced by about 15 yuan.</p>
<h3>Bank Clearing House Continues to Increase Exchange Rate Interest</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Banking Association Clearing House, due to the continued tightening of the money supply in the market, increased the discount rate for exchange transactions.

"Note": Compared to March 2, the national currency interest rate has not changed, and the exchange rate interest rate has increased by 2 cents.</p>
<h3>US Dollar Bills Once Reached 15 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreign currencies were heavily absorbed due to the weak pound price, and the market price was very firm. There was a scarce supply of British and American gold pounds, and there was strong demand for British and American gold notes. The morning price of US dollar notes rose to 14 yuan 81 cents, and the afternoon price rose further to 15 yuan. The evening market fell slightly to 14 yuan 98 cents. The supply of Hong Kong notes and French francs was not smooth. Singapore notes and Dutch notes rose sharply. Canadian notes and Philippine notes tracked expensively. Japanese remainder notes were stable, with an evening market price of 1 yuan 29 cents 6 li. Korean notes remained at 1 yuan 01 cent 2 li. Yesterday's market prices: British gold pounds rose by 2 yuan, British gold notes rose by 2 jiao, US gold pounds rose by 1 yuan 5 jiao, US dollar notes rose by 2 jiao 5 fen, Hong Kong notes rose by 5 li, French francs rose by 4 li, Singapore notes, Dutch notes, and rupee notes rose by 5 fen, Annam notes, Canadian notes, and Philippine notes all rose by 1 jiao. Other currencies were unchanged.</p>
<h3>British and Indian Silver Prices Both Fall; US Silver Remains Flat</h3>
<p>London, 11th - The silver market saw a small number of public sales, lacking support, and remained flat after the close. Large silver bars, both near and far terms, narrowed by 25. New York silver report: US spot remained flat. Also, Mumbai silver report: The Indian silver market was weak, with both current and forward rates falling by 12 annas. Only 25 transaction tickets were traded.</p>
<h3>Discount Narrows by Half a Yuan; Discount Interest Rate Rises by One Cent</h3>
<p>Yesterday's exchange bill discount rate first fell and then rebounded. The morning rate fell from 47 yuan to 42 yuan per thousand yuan, rebounded at noon to 46 yuan, and continued to rise to 48 and a half yuan in the afternoon, narrowing by half a yuan compared to the previous day. The discount interest rate of the Money Industry Association rose by one cent in both the morning and afternoon markets, reaching 1 jiao 7 fen, it is said.</p>
<h3>Yarn &amp; Cotton: Guangdong Buyers Slightly Active in Spring Sales; Cotton Yarn Rising More Sharply; Double Horse Futures Raised to 948 Yuan</h3>
<p>The yarn market continued to rise, and the rising momentum became even more intense. This was due to the unanimous bullish sentiment and extreme enthusiasm. At the same time, Guangdong buyers' spring sales of 32-count and 20-count fine yarn improved, triggering buying momentum, and speculators took the opportunity to fuel the trend. However, it has recently been heard that the rising momentum of a certain yarn is more moderate and not as rapid as that of the local yarn. If the price ratio differs too much, Chinese yarn will also be constrained.</p>
<p>The morning opening of the current yarn market saw continued strong sentiment, with a continuous stream of buyers. The opening price for March delivery of 20-count Double Horse yarn was 939 yuan. Subsequently, it was heard that the foreign exchange rate had narrowed by 0.03125, and multiple parties were even more active. The market rose step by step, reaching 947-8 yuan. The closing price was 947 and a half yuan. It is estimated that the total trading volume for half a day was 1,970 yuan. The spot price of 20-count Double Horse yarn rose by 16 yuan. The amount purchased by each group is listed below:</p>
<p>Hong Kong 735 Inland 55</p>
<p>Peers 1,180 Total 1,970</p>
<h3>Pricing of Indian Cotton Gradually Approaching; Cotton Not as Expensive as Yarn</h3>
<p>The trading of local cotton was still fairly good, but rarer than the previous day. The market saw no significant fluctuations. Although the yarn market was rising step by step, the cotton market was mild and flat, which was due to the lack of development in factory demand. At the same time, the pricing of Indian cotton was gradually approaching, and various cotton shops began to order Indian cotton. Therefore, sentiment in the cotton market was not as high as in the yarn market. There was no sign of cotton from northern Jiangsu. The current cotton transaction situation is listed below:</p>
<p>In addition, the foreign cotton market price, the New York cotton market, initially saw a rising market with a lack of important buyers, and a telegram from Liverpool reported a fall, causing the market to appear quite sluggish. In addition, overseas cotton merchants were selling in the market. As a result, the closing price for the near term fell by 45 pounds. However, the far term rose by 3 pounds. The Indian cotton market fell by another 4 rupees yesterday, including predictions, due to the talk of a European peace atmosphere. Egyptian rose by 35 pounds.</p>
<p>Shanghai Foreign Cotton Trading: Due to the tightening of the exchange rate in recent days, trading between peers has been quite quiet. Manufacturers are purchasing with limited interest due to the large number of arrivals. The same is true for Japanese factories. The shipping price to the factory calculated based on the US dollar exchange rate of 6 yuan 625 is as follows:</p>
<p>20-count American Middling 269.20</p>
<p>20-count American Low Middling 258.50</p>
<p>32-count American Middling 282.00</p>
<p>32-count American Low Middling 271.00</p>
<p>42-count American Middling 285.20</p>
<p>42-count American Low Middling 273.20</p>
<h3>Securities: Domestic Bond Market Flat; Foreign Stocks Flat and Weak</h3>
<p>Securities</p>
<p>Yesterday, the unofficial securities market spent the day in a state of churning and brewing. There has been no upward or downward movement for many days. If it is said that the money supply is too tight and there are insufficient investment funds, then gold rose sharply again yesterday, and foreign stock trading is still developed. If it is said that there is no change in the environment, then the gradual tightening of the foreign exchange rate is enough to reflect the changes in the situation. These are not the key points. Since the rise in goods prices, speculators inevitably have their own intentions and manipulate the market. In this harsh flood, the market relies entirely on the fact that major financial institutions retain large amounts of capital and do not release it. The liquid chips in the market are limited. Without drastic changes, it is not easy to cause fluctuations. Therefore, the market has been able to maintain its intermediate market price over the years. The endless churning seen now is nothing new, so it is temporarily not expected to change. Yesterday, buyers and sellers were particularly indifferent, and the market gathering dispersed in less than ten minutes. As a result, there were only 5-cent fluctuations. The total daily trading volume was around 300,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below:</p>
<p>Stock Trading: 20 shares of Continental Bank stock were traded, with a price of 600 yuan per share. This is a deciduous stock, with a face value of 1,000 yuan per share, equivalent to a 60% market price.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the stock markets of various public firms were closed in commemoration of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's death anniversary, and the stock market was very gloomy as a result. Trading was scarce in the morning, and prices were stable. The market was more lively in the afternoon, because there were slightly more sellers, so prices fell slightly. Near the close, the selling lines showed signs of wavering, and most prices returned to their original levels. The closing trend was stable, and rubber bonds were uneventful.</p>
<p>London</p>
<p>London, 10th (Monday) - It is reported that the official rates for Chinese foreign debt and British Far East company stocks were stable today. There were no upward or downward movements for any bonds or stocks.</p>
<h3>Seafood: First Batch of New Fragrant Mushrooms Arrived</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a certain company received 10 pieces of new fragrant mushrooms from Chuzhou, with a price of 675 yuan 6 jiao. It is said that a large batch is expected to arrive on the next ship, and the market trend is bearish. It is reported that the production price of Jian mushrooms has risen by another 30 yuan.</p>
<h3>Food: Wuxi Rice Falls Sharply; Foreign Rice Also Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>In the Wuxi rice and paddy market, hoarders and cargo ships have been actively selling in recent days. The number of rice and paddy samples appearing in the market has increased daily. Although rice mills have contracted to sell 60,000 piculs of white japonica rice, rice millers are limited by their existing stock and cannot enter the market to make up for their contracted sales. As a result, the active market atmosphere has reversed from its previous outlook, leading to an oversupply situation. The market price of rice and paddy has gradually eased. In the past three days, the price of unpolished white japonica rice has fallen by about 2 yuan per picul, and the price of japonica and indica paddy has also fallen by 1 yuan per dan. Currently, high-quality white japonica rice is priced at 27 yuan 5 jiao to 27 yuan per picul, unpolished japonica rice is at 24 yuan 5 jiao, and japonica paddy is at 12 yuan 7-8 jiao per dan. The market has entered a normal state. Since the beginning of the red disk for miscellaneous grains, the prices of yellow tea beans, wheat, and sesame have risen sharply, with each picul soaring by more than 10 yuan. Recently, prices in Shanghai have also gradually fallen, causing sentiment in Wuxi to be uniformly bearish. As a result, those with stock are eager to sell, as profits have already been huge. Within the week, the price of yellow mung beans and sesame has fallen drastically by 10 yuan per picul, and the price of wheat has also fallen by several yuan. The price of flour this year has risen gradually from 11-12 yuan per bag to 14-15 yuan, purely due to speculative trading and monopoly. The total amount of flour stored in the city is over 200,000 bags, most of which are in the hands of hoarders. The daily flour consumption of the entire town is less than 100 bags. If the export of this stored flour is prohibited, it can be sold until the end of the year. Seeing the downward trend in Shanghai recently, they are eager to sell, with the price of current flour as low as 12 yuan 3-4 jiao and the price of futures flour as low as 11 yuan, but there are few interested buyers. The price has fallen by 2 yuan per bag within the last ten days. (Knowing)</p>
<p>Foreign rice also arrived in Shanghai yesterday. The Taigu company's Taiyuan ship brought 4,347 bags from Haiphong and 5,310 bags from Hong Kong, totaling 9,657 bags. It was imported at noon yesterday and unloaded at the company's wharf in the French Concession. (Zu)</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Upper Grade Cart White Recovers Well</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market saw little significant fluctuation. The association's official price for current goods was 62 yuan for unbleached white sugar at the company's warehouse and 61 yuan 6 jiao for newly arrived sugar at the outer warehouse and 61 yuan 3 jiao for old goods, a rise of only 1 jiao. Cart white from Taigu recovered by 3-5 jiao. West Warehouse B mark also arrived at 66 yuan, CX mark at 65 yuan and a half, CX mark unchanged, DY mark at 64 yuan, a rise of 2 jiao. There were few changes in the rest. There were minor transactions in domestic sugar, and the price also stabilized. In addition, 2,200 bags of sugar arrived from Haikou on the 12th.</p>
<h3>Metals: Bamboo Steel Bars Slightly Stabilize</h3>
<p>The trading of bamboo steel bars remained frequent yesterday. Most of the transactions were handled by construction groups on this street. However, out-of-town business was also active. Due to the high spirits of peers, the market price remained strong. However, it has fallen by a large amount of 50-60 yuan compared to the past. At the moment, 3-4 points sell for 1,050 yuan per ton and 5 points to one inch for 1,000 yuan per ton, it is said.</p>
<h3>Cloth: Sales of Woolen Fabrics are Not Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sales of woolen fabrics were not sluggish, with wholesale merchants sending many packages by post. Inland merchants mostly ordered khaki and grass-green serge, Walter cloth, riding breeches cloth, and uniform cloth. For commercial woolen fabrics, only domestic products are accepted, and a sales license issued by the manufacturer is required. These are piled up in the occupied areas because there are no restrictions on the country of origin, resulting in higher sales than in the interior, especially in the Tianjin and Beijing areas.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Dried Cocoons Originate in Shanghai; Silk Factories' Raw Material Panic Can Be Resolved</h3>
<p>Although Shanghai silk factories generally made profits last year, their development was limited because their raw materials were controlled by others. By the end of the year and the beginning of this year, almost all silk factories had shut down. Now, it is learned that Zhejiang East cocoons have been arriving in Shanghai in a steady stream. The first batch, transported by the Haida Wheel, totaled 1,012 pieces. The second and third batches will also be transported in succession. Therefore, before the new cocoons come onto the market, the raw material panic of silk factories may be partially resolved.</p>
<p>It is also reported that 25 cases of rayon arrived from Hong Kong yesterday, and 1,660 pieces of tea arrived from Ningbo.</p>
<h3>New Situation and the Raw Silk Industry</h3>
<p>— Yi Zhi</p>
<p>In the third year of the war, drastic changes are taking place both domestically and abroad. These changes have formed the current new situation, namely, the outbreak of the European war, the abrogation of the U.S.-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation, the establishment of the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact, and the disintegration of the Rome-Berlin-Tokyo Axis. In the Sino-Japanese War, the opponent's international environment has become even more isolated. In addition, China's subjective strength has increased over the past three years. As a result, this new situation has also affected the raw silk industry. Because these circumstances are beneficial to China, they are also beneficial to the Chinese silk industry. However, to make good use of a favorable situation, it is necessary to explore the possible reactions of the new situation to the production and sales of raw silk.</p>
<p>(1) Some people say that the abrogation of the U.S.-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation will greatly improve the sales of Chinese silk in the United States. Because the United States is the world's largest consumer of raw silk, the termination of the treaty will inevitably put Chinese silk's competitors at a disadvantage. This view is partially accurate. However, the reality is not so simple. Because the abrogation of the treaty does not mean an economic break between the United States and Japan, it is just a step taken by the U.S. rulers to force Japan to submit. At the same time, the word "submit" does not really mean "deal a fatal blow," but rather requires Japan to continue to exist aggressively in the Far East as an imperialist policeman within the U.S. limit (the limit of U.S.-Japan equilibrium). This is also a fierce constraint on China's liberation and the development of China's national capital. For this reason, although the United States' purchase of Japanese silk is not bound by any treaty, it will not decrease as much as we would like. On the contrary, it will continue to transport large quantities of military supplies and gasoline to Japan (see the Reuters dispatch from Havana on February 29 regarding the contradictions of the United States). And Japanese silk will continue to be shipped to the U.S. market in a steady stream. However, there may be some progress in the sale of Chinese silk in the United States. This is due to the sense of justice of the American people. This is a prediction for the sale of Chinese silk in the United States this year.</p>
<p>(2) On the European front, not to mention the spread of the European war, which may expand and destroy the markets of Britain and France and disrupt the entire European economic organization (however, in fact, this trend will be unavoidable), but just the impact of the termination of the U.S.-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation on the European silk market, the position of Chinese silk in Europe may be considerably squeezed. Because when Britain saw that the renewal of the U.S.-Japan Treaty was hopeless, it was eager to take this opportunity to increase the figures of trade with Japan (see the Reuters dispatch from London on February [day omitted]). At the same time, Japanese silk, subjectively, will of course have to find another way to make up for the losses caused by the abrogation of the U.S.-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation. In that case, the sale of Chinese silk to the United States will not have as much progress as ideal, but on the European side, it may suffer unexpected blows. The large amount of Japanese silk shipped to Britain and France is a prediction for the sale of Chinese silk in Europe this year.</p>
<p>Regarding this prediction, we must also consider the future progress of the European war. That is to say, even if the quantity of Japanese silk shipped to Europe is not too large, the European silk market will greatly add many difficulties due to the development of the war, in terms of transportation between Europe and Asia, and in the economic life of the entire European people, causing the market to shrink or stagnate.

<h3>Commemoration of the Premier's Death: Shanghai Citizens Solemn and Determined; Yesterday, the Entire City Flew Flags at Half-Mast to Express Grief; Support National Policy and Strive for Final Victory</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the 15th anniversary of the death of the Premier. All sectors of the city lowered their flags to half-mast and ceased entertainment and banquets in deep mourning to commemorate the Premier's great revolutionary achievements and noble revolutionary character. Jianghai Customs, post offices, courts, and various public organizations and schools followed suit and took a holiday. The schools also held memorial services to expound on the Premier's revolutionary history as a model. All sectors believe that the Premier devoted his life to the revolution, aiming to seek freedom and equality for China. In the revolutionary process, his spirit of perseverance, courage, and indomitable spirit is forever a model for us. The Premier said on his deathbed, "Peaceful struggle to save China." The Chinese people deeply realize that peace was declared hopeless before the July 7th Incident. Only by resolutely struggling can we save China. Therefore, we are more determined to uphold the belief in the national policy, follow the revolutionary path indicated by the Premier, and strive for the realization of China's freedom and equality. The police departments of the two concessions dispatched additional detectives yesterday to inspect pedestrians on various roads, and patrol cars were also dispatched to patrol to prevent troublemakers. The whole day passed peacefully.</p>
<p>Expanded Promotion of the Honesty and Shame Movement</p>
<p>Yesterday was the 15th anniversary of the Premier's death. The Honesty and Shame Movement Committee of all sectors of the city held a day of expanded promotion. In advance, the committee prepared and issued key points of propaganda and notified the subordinate practice groups to go out to promote, distribute leaflets, and publish a letter to fellow citizens, encouraging citizens to strengthen their beliefs, overcome difficulties, examine themselves, and strive for brightness. The original text has been seen in previous newspapers.

Afterwards, Mr. Luo Ziqiang, the general secretary of the committee, gave a solemn speech with tears in his eyes, which moved the audience. After that, they held a vegetarian lunch. In the afternoon, they went to designated locations in various districts to inspect the work of the practice groups, and the results were quite satisfactory.</p>
<h3>The Banking Industry is Ordered to Promote Agricultural Loans; The Loan Amount Depends on the Needs of Various Regions, According to the Outline of Agricultural Loan Measures</h3>
<p>Since the four banks, China, Central, Communications, and Farmers Bank, formulated the outline of agricultural loan measures for the 29th year, the banking industry in Shanghai has been ordered to promote it.

It is reported that all commercial banks are jointly handling agricultural loans in various regions in accordance with the outline of agricultural loan measures, and all money houses have decided to participate in agricultural loans. The loan area is determined to be as widespread as possible, and the direct enjoyment of loan benefits by farmers is maximized. The procedures are simplified as much as possible to adapt to the farming season. The loan targets are agricultural groups, individual farmers, and agricultural improvement agencies. It is also reported that each bank has signed agricultural loan contracts with the governments of various provinces and is actively promoting agricultural loans.</p>
<h3>Judge Yu Ting's Posthumous Honor; Yu Gongzi is Studying in the United States; Chairman Chiang Ordered a Subsidy</h3>
<p>After Yu Hua, the criminal court judge of the Second Branch of the Shanghai High Court, was assassinated and martyred, it was reported to the National Government. Now, his family received a condolence telegram from Chairman Chiang, which read, "To Madam Yu Chenyin, The sacrifice of Judge Yu is deeply mourned.

<h3>The Xin'an'na Steamer Will Arrive in Shanghai Tomorrow Morning; Passengers are Safe</h3>
<p>The Xin'an'na steamer of Maersk Line ran aground in Wenzhou on the 10th, as reported yesterday. According to information, after the Xin'an'na steamer telegraphed that it had run aground, Maersk Line immediately sent a ship to rescue it. It is expected that the Xin'an'na steamer will safely arrive in Shanghai at 8:00 tomorrow morning and dock at the Roosevelt Wharf. It is reported that the ship's propeller was severely damaged. Although there were about 200 passengers on board, it is reported that no one was injured due to the rapid rescue by lifeboats.</p>
<h3>Oil Merchants from Zhejiang Province in Shanghai Organize an Oil Company</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war in eastern Zhejiang, various types of oil from various parts of Zhejiang Province in this city have not been as strong as before due to transportation difficulties. It is now learned that various oil merchants in the production area, in order to seek smooth sales of local products, have jointly organized an Oil Co., Ltd. by Huilong Commercial Bank in this city, intending to specialize in various vegetable oils, such as lard, green oil, pine oil, vegetable oil, tea oil, etc., and transport them to Shanghai for sale. Preparations are actively underway.</p>
<h3>Domestic Rice Arrives in Shanghai in Large Quantities; Further Price Drops are Expected; Yesterday, People Crowded to Buy Rice at Fair Prices; There is No Fear of Rice Shortage in This City in the Future</h3>
<p>The rice industry and tea market in this city were closed yesterday because it was the anniversary of the Premier's death. The market will be open as usual today. In recent days, not only have more than 100,000 bags of foreign rice flooded in, but also domestic rice from the surrounding countryside and inland ports, such as Kunshan and Luodian, has been transported in, resulting in sufficient rice supply in this city and the possibility of further price drops. Also, yesterday, due to the anniversary of the Premier's death, factories were closed, and the number of workers buying rice at fair prices suddenly increased, resulting in overcrowding in front of various rice shops selling rice at fair prices. Yesterday afternoon, a reporter passed by the Xinda Rice Shop on Lihmei Road in the French Concession and saw about 700 or 800 people buying rice at fair prices. Chinese and Western patrolmen were doing their best to maintain order on the spot, so no accidents occurred.</p>
<p>Large Quantities of Du Rice are Transported from the Surrounding Countryside</p>
<p>The Mainland Daily reports that according to well-informed sources in the business community, several rice merchants in this city have now pooled hundreds of trucks to buy Du rice in the surrounding countryside and transport it to the concession. The number of workers hired is at least three to four thousand, and the profits are very high. The only difficulty is that the rice must pass through the lines of Japanese sentries. According to a certain rice merchant, buying rice in Baoshan and Songjiang costs only 30 yuan per picul, and paying the Japanese soldiers 5 yuan per picul, and still can obtain high profits after transporting it to Shanghai. It is said that about 3,000 dan of rice have been transported into the concession through this route. In addition, about 3,000 bags have been transported into the concession by water in the past two weeks. Therefore, there is no fear of food shortage in this city, but the reason why rice prices are still surprisingly high is entirely due to speculation and profiteering.</p>
<h3>Five Chinese Directors Will Be Reelected in the Upcoming Municipal Council Election; All Parties Hope that the Five Directors Will Continue to Serve; British and American Directors Held Primaries</h3>
<p>In the upcoming election of directors of the Municipal Council, British and American expatriates have already nominated candidates. Regarding the issue of Chinese director candidates, it was learned yesterday that the Taxpayers' Association of Chinese People attaches great importance to the opinions of various taxpayer Chinese people. It is currently weighing the list of candidates and plans to announce it before the end of this month.

They still hope that the five Chinese directors of the previous term, Yu Qiaqing, Xi Yushu, Yuan Ludeng, Guo Shun, and Jiang Yiping, will be re-elected. However, whether there will be any changes to one or two people has not yet been decided.</p>
<p>British and American Directors Hold Primaries</p>
<p>The English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post reported that various British expatriate groups in this city have held primaries for the upcoming election of directors of the Municipal Council in order to vote for five Chinese directors and seven candidates. Taxpaying members of the American Union of Shanghai with the qualifications to elect directors of the Municipal Council will also participate in the association's primary to select two candidates from the three candidates, Karna, MacDonald, and Arlman. The number of people among the more than 1,000 members of the American Union of Shanghai who are eligible to vote has not yet been investigated. However, it is estimated that about 500 American expatriates in Shanghai are eligible to vote, and most of them are members of the American Union of Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Deliberations on the Resumption of Tram Transportation in the Northern District; Public Buses Have Not Been Negotiated; The Japanese Side's Attitude is Still Very Ambiguous</h3>
<p>The English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post reported that according to Mr. Owen, general manager of the British-owned Shanghai Electric Construction Company, he has been continuously consulting directly with the Japanese Consulate authorities regarding the resumption of tram transportation in the northern district of the Public Concession, and the British Consulate has also been mediating, but rumors that traffic will resume from Friday are untrue because the matter is still at a loss. Owen also denied that he had consulted with the Huazhong Metropolitan Bus Company, which is currently operating in the northern district. As for the resumption of bus services in the northern district by the British-owned Shanghai General Omnibus Company, Mr. Migg, chairman of the company, stated that the matter is still uncertain and negotiations have not yet begun. According to a spokesman for the Japanese Embassy, the tram and bus companies must recognize the "de facto existence of public bus routes" in the northern district of the Public Concession, and all matters must be negotiated by the three companies themselves.</p>
<h3>Indian Coal Water Freight Increases Sharply; It Has Increased Fivefold Since the European War; Ships Are Scarce and Difficult to Obtain</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Machine-Made Coal Briquette Industry Association recently stated that the freight cost of coal is closely related to the cost of coal briquettes and has sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce requesting measures to reduce it. It is now heard that the import freight cost of Indian coal from Calcutta to Shanghai used to be 5 shillings per ton based on the ship's own weight. Since the current European war, it has increased to more than 25 shillings, and ships are not easy to obtain. Moreover, due to the war, it is impossible to sign long-term contracts for Indian coal. Even the Shanghai Electric Power Company, which needs the most coal every year, cannot sign a contract.</p>
<h3>The Shelter for the Poor Postpones Dissolution; Currently Sheltering More Than 1,000 Poor People</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Charity Organizations Federation previously established a shelter for the poor in North Fujian Road and Difeng Road to provide relief to poor people, sheltering more than 1,100 people. Now that the earth has returned to spring and the climate has gradually become warmer, it was originally planned to dissolve it immediately. However, due to the current high prices, the poor people who were sheltered from the cold would inevitably become starved to death if they were left without support once they left the shelter. Therefore, the dissolution date has been specially postponed to promote good deeds. Since the association began providing steamed buns and ginger soup at Dahua Road and Mabai Road, donations from all parties have been very enthusiastic. It has now been decided to continue the activity, but every Sunday will be changed to a holiday and stopped. The poor people waiting for relief have been notified.</p>
<h3>Reduction of Coal Slurry Freight is Difficult to Postpone; Yu Qiaqing Asks the Municipal Council to Invite Various Shipping Companies to Discuss</h3>
<p>After the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce received a letter from the Machine-Made Coal Briquette Association requesting Yu Qiaqing to contact the reduction of coal dust freight, it has now received a reply from Yu stating, "Regarding the matter of various machine-made coal briquette factories selling raw materials for coal briquettes at a fair price and reducing freight costs, I have asked the Municipal Council authorities to invite various shipping companies to discuss the reduction. As it concerns social stability, it should be realized as soon as possible. This is to reply. I hope you will cooperate." In order to discuss proper measures, the Shanghai Fair Price Coal Briquette Committee specially convened a meeting of the entire committee at 4:00 p.m. yesterday at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce on Hong Kong Road. More than ten people attended, including Yu Qiaqing, Xu Jiyin, Yan Esheng, Wei Zhida, Bao Zhexiong, Lu Qisheng, Yun Chunxin, and Chen Cuifang. Chairman Xu Jiyin first reported the purpose of the meeting, followed by representatives of various fuel industries reporting on the situation of selling coal briquettes at fair prices and the serious impact on various coal briquette factories due to the high freight costs of coal dust. Yu Qiaqing approved on the spot to find a way. Then, discussions began. Various proposals must be formally decided before they can be announced. The meeting adjourned at 6:15.</p>
<h3>Small Packets of Mail Must Be Firmly Packaged to Avoid Dampness and Breakage; Otherwise, the Post Office Will Not Accept Them</h3>
<p>Since the military rise, traffic has been blocked in various places, transportation has been stagnant, and postal transportation has been difficult. The Transportation Division of the Shanghai Postal Administration is doing its best to unblock postal deliveries in various places to comfort people from all over the country who are in Shanghai. However, all packages, large and small, inevitably suffer damage due to the time-consuming transportation. Therefore, all senders must properly package them in advance. The following is an excerpt from the announcement of the small package mail group of the bureau: "For announcement, the packaging method for small packages of mail is subject to the regulations for parcel packaging, which have been clearly stated in Article 209 of the Postal Regulations. It has now been found that the small packages of mail sent by various merchants recently often break in the middle due to improper packaging, and the contents are damaged, especially small packages of medicines. They are not packed in sturdy wooden boxes and sufficiently filled with wood chips, cotton, and other items. Therefore, a special announcement is made, and all merchants should pay attention. In the future, small packages with improper packaging will not be accepted. This is the announcement." A reporter from the New Sound News Agency learned from the parcel business group of the bureau yesterday that for all packages, large and small, sent from Shanghai to various places, the packages are transported with many turns, and the equipment of various post offices is not yet perfect. If it rains, they will inevitably be exposed to moisture. Therefore, it is best for the senders of various packages to use wooden boxes to avoid any hidden dangers.</p>
<h3>When Applying for Certificates for Woven Fabrics, Sales Vouchers Should Be Attached</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to various yarn companies yesterday regarding the matter of issuing certificates for domestic cotton yarn and woven fabrics, stating, "It has been found that the yarn sold by various yarn factories from March 1st onwards is accompanied by sales vouchers, which are given to customers for safekeeping. When applying for a certificate, this sales voucher should be sent to the association for verification and cancellation in order to prevent the abuse of one certificate for two uses. Please follow this procedure."</p>
<h3>Post Office Develops Japanese Military Drafts Without Reporting to the Head Office; Purely a One-Sided Agreement to Accommodate the Bad Environment; Post Offices Within the Concessions Refuse to Develop Them</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Administration surprisingly complied with the Japanese request and developed drafts for Japanese military scrip in [ports] such as Hankou and Jiujiang. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Violating Regulations</p>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Administration, complying with the Japanese request, surprisingly began on the 10th of this month to allow the public to develop drafts in Japanese military scrip for [ports] such as Hankou and Jiujiang through post offices. This measure completely contradicts the postal remittance regulations, and is thus attracting considerable attention.</p>
<p>Not Reported</p>
<p>This matter was purely a one-sided agreement between the Director of the Shanghai Postal Administration, Zha Peilin, and the Japanese Deputy Postmaster, Kanezashi Kinjiro, with the Japanese side, and was not reported to the head office for approval. It is believed that after learning of this matter, the head office will certainly send a telegram of inquiry.</p>
<p>Bureau Refuses to Issue</p>
<p>The handling of military scrip exchange is still limited to implementation in occupied areas. Therefore, all postal branches within the two concessions of Shanghai are not following suit. Only the Heng Road branch in Hongkou can handle remittances, and the paying offices are limited to Hankou and Jiujiang.</p>
<p>Bureau's Justification</p>
<p>According to a person close to postal circles who spoke to the Datong News Agency reporter, the post office's move is purely to cope with the environment and avoid friction between Japanese military personnel and post offices in the occupied areas. Therefore, it is hoped that the outside world can understand their predicament.</p>

<h3>Anti-Tuberculosis Campaign to Open Soon; Scheduled to Be Held at Hongqiao Sanatorium; Free X-ray Photography and Examination</h3>
<p>The large-scale Shanghai anti-tuberculosis campaign, jointly initiated by leaders from all sectors of the city, has been gradually prepared and is ready. Yesterday, a reception was held at the Bankers' Club for all sectors and the press. Attendees included Yu Qiaqing, Lin Kanghou, Yuan Ludeng, Xu Jiqing, Pei Yunqing, Ding Fubao, Zhao Jinqing, Jiang Yiping, Ge Futian, Pan Yangyao, Xu Guanqun, Xu Xiaochu, Huang Yuzhai, Wang Jian'e, He Wuliang, Zhu Gengtao, Luo Zhican, Zhu Yutao, Wang Wanbai, Zhu Yanggao, Dong Xingsheng, Wang Jingdong, Huang Jiayin, Sun Choucheng, Ding Huikang, Lin Zhifu, Jiang Yiqiu, and others, totaling over one hundred people.</p>
<p>General Success of Tuberculosis Prevention in Various Countries</p>
<p>Mr. Lin Kanghou was publicly elected as chairman. The chairman then elaborated on the importance of this campaign, stating that people all over the world are suffering from tuberculosis. In the United States at the beginning of this century, the tuberculosis mortality rate was the highest of all mortality rates, but now it has dropped to sixth place. In Germany, it has also decreased from twelve deaths per ten thousand people to seven. This achievement is due to the progress of hygiene and medical care in various countries, but in reality, it is also thanks to efforts in tuberculosis prevention.</p>
<p>Status Quo of the Isolated Island: Rampant Tuberculosis</p>
<p>However, our country is the country with the most tuberculosis cases. Due to the lack of public health facilities and the lack of attention to tuberculosis prevention methods, the mortality rate from tuberculosis is increasing rather than decreasing. In the current special circumstances of the isolated island, the population has increased sharply, the environment is deteriorating, and the spread of tuberculosis is becoming more rampant. The general patient families cling to old habits, rely entirely on ineffective drugs, and delay treatment, which is the biggest reason for the high tuberculosis rate. Not only do patients suffer incalculable losses in life, time, and economy, but society and the country also lose talent and reduce production, and the indirect losses are incalculable. This is truly heartbreaking.</p>
<p>The Way to Save Lives Lies in Diagnosis</p>
<p>The way to save lives is to awaken society, impart knowledge of tuberculosis prevention, break bad habits, and trust in correct diagnosis. X-ray examination is the only condition for reducing lung disease and its spread. Anyone who wants to know if they have lung disease, or to what extent, must rely on X-ray diagnosis as the most accurate judge. This X-ray diagnosis is even more beneficial if performed early.</p>
<p>Emphasizing Inspection to Prevent Spread</p>
<p>The number of latent tuberculosis patients is extremely large, and sometimes they are also open, meaning that their sputum contains tubercle bacilli, but the patients are unaware. These tubercle bacilli are the source of tuberculosis transmission, and their harm is more dangerous than a city tiger. However, once X-ray diagnosis is performed, latent tuberculosis can be detected. On the one hand, early treatment can save time and money and achieve twice the result with half the effort. On the other hand, it can reduce the risk of transmission, which is of great importance to family happiness, public health, and social health. Deputy chairmen Yuan Ludeng, Pei Yunqing, Xu Guanqun, Huang Yuzhai, and Tao Leqin also spoke in succession, each with extremely thorough remarks, and the audience applauded.</p>
<p>Young Men and Women Should Pay Special Attention</p>
<p>Yuan Ludeng said in his speech that in the past, our country's people were stubborn, and those who suffered from tuberculosis would never reveal it to others. The most patients are between the ages of 20 and 30, which is also the most dangerous. He hoped that everyone would vigorously publicize it so that everyone would have the opportunity to take precautions in advance. Xu Guanqun said in his speech that the seriousness of the tuberculosis prevention problem is no less than the people's food problem. In ancient times, there were those who used secret prescriptions and elixirs to treat diseases. Everyone knows how effective they are. It is enough to prove that drugs can only play an auxiliary role. The key to disease is prevention. Dr. Wang Wanbai talked about the mortality rate in China, which is generally (including women, children, and the elderly) one in seven, meaning that one in seven deaths is due to tuberculosis. Between the ages of 20 and 30, it is one in three, meaning that one in three deaths is due to tuberculosis. To eliminate this great enemy of mankind, we must mobilize all sectors of the city to publicize it widely.</p>
<p>Ding Huikang Talks About the Motivation for Tuberculosis Prevention</p>
<p>Finally, Dr. Ding Huikang spoke about the motivation for this campaign, stating that in the physical examinations of students in Chongqing two years ago, only 65 out of 10,000 people were healthy. This shows the unsoundness of the Chinese physique. There are two differences between Chinese and foreign medicine. Foreigners value examination and treatment only after diagnosis, while Chinese people do the opposite, valuing medication and neglecting examination. Patients hope to recover immediately, but this procedure is detrimental to both their mental and economic well-being. Individual health is of great importance to the country's future. He hopes that people from all walks of life will work together to promote it.</p>
<p>Various Parties Support Scheduled Implementation</p>
<p>All parties unanimously support this large-scale tuberculosis prevention campaign. In its implementation plan, in addition to popularizing early X-ray diagnosis, it will also carry out basic work such as free X-ray photography, free sputum examination, and free tuberculosis diagnosis. It has now been decided to start on the 15th of this month at the Hongqiao Sanatorium at 990 Avenue Joffre. Its contribution to improving the health of citizens and benefiting the general poor and sick is truly significant.</p>
<h3>New Subsidiary Coins in Circulation; Old Coins Cease Exchange and Issuance</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the European War, the source of nickel has been cut off and prices have soared. In order to prevent manipulation and melting by unscrupulous merchants, the Ministry of Finance ordered the Central Bank Issuance Bureau to order all branches to stop exchanging and issuing nickel coins, and to revise the Subsidiary Coin Regulations to issue new subsidiary coins. The fineness and weight of these coins have been reduced. It is reported that the new subsidiary coins have been minted by the Central Mint, divided into 1-fen, 2-fen, 5-fen, and 10-fen denominations, and issued by the Central Bank. They are already in circulation in Chongqing and other places.</p>
<h3>Plank Box Industry Workers Resume Work This Morning</h3>
<p>The plank box industry workers in this city recently made a request to the capitalists to improve their treatment on the grounds that prices are soaring and their livelihoods are difficult. They went on strike the day before yesterday. The Plank Box Industry Association has now resolved to first persuade the workers to work as usual today. If they have legitimate demands, they can send responsible representatives to formally submit them to the association's office at No. 10, Lane 70, Jing'an Temple Road at any time. It is reported that after persuasion, the workers have agreed to resume work today.</p>
<h3>Most of the Bodies in the Jingsheng Ferry Boat Retrieved</h3>
<p>After the divers hired by Tianhu began to salvage the bodies in the Jingsheng barge that capsized in Ningbo on the 8th, they worked day and night and were very active. Initially, the accumulation of bodies in the boat made salvage time-consuming. After they were taken out one by one, the cabin became loose, so a large number of bodies were recovered in the past two days. According to a telegram from Ningbo received in this port the night before last, in addition to the 16 male and female bodies recovered on the morning of the 10th, another 35 bodies were recovered from 2 pm to 4 pm. The names of the dead have mostly been identified, including 13 male bodies, 14 female bodies, and 8 male and female children. 24 bodies were recovered from morning to night on the 11th, so a total of 59 bodies were recovered in one and a half days, and including the previous 40 bodies, the total reached 99 bodies. The salvage was still continuing yesterday.</p>
<h3>Jinshan Residents Lu Xiao and His Wife Were Chopped Wounded Yesterday Morning; The Couple Were Chopped Multiple Times and Both Suffered Serious Injuries; It Is Said That Lu Holds the Position of Commissioner in a Certain Faction</h3>

<p>Continuously</p>
<p>Lu was chopped in the head, chest and abdomen four times, and Lu's wife was chopped twice in the head. The murderers, seeing that their goal had been achieved, turned around and went downstairs to escape. At that time, Lu and his wife were lying in a pool of blood. After the neighbors discovered it, they entered the room to see, and Lu and his wife were dying and in a coma. They reported it to the French police, who sent detectives to investigate, and at the same time summoned an ambulance to send Lu and his wife to the Red Cross Hospital on Route Haig. Later, they were</p>
<p>Learned by the Revolutionary Side</p>
<p>Drove to the Red Cross Hospital to transfer Lu and his wife to Fumin Hospital on Route Cardinal Mercier for treatment. The cause of the Lu couple's attack is currently under strict investigation by the French police.</p>
<h3>Three Sisters From Beiping Were Run Over by a Car</h3>
<p>Bai Lanchun, a woman from Beiping, 19 years old, followed by Meichun, 18 years old, and youngest Xuechun, 17 years old, the three sisters are all dressed fashionably and gracefully. They live at No. 12 Zhilanfang, Route Cardinal Foch in the French Concession. At around 7:45 the night before last, the three sisters hired two rickshaws and were pulled to other places by Liang Guiren and Shen Linhua, who were from north of the Yangtze River. Unexpectedly, when they passed Route Cardinal Foch and Route Doumer, a British Route 9 public bus sped past, and the driver accidentally caused the accident, knocking down and running over the two rickshaws carrying the Bai sisters and the two rickshaw pullers. Bai Lanchun was crushed in the head and suffered severe injuries. Xuechun was also injured in the head. Meichun was injured in the foot and her injuries were relatively minor. The two rickshaw pullers, Liang and Shen, were both crushed in the foot. The patrol officers arrived quickly, and quickly summoned an ambulance to rush them to Guangci Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Robbers Refused Arrest at Avenue Dubail the Night Before Last; Tear Gas Grenade Thrown; Four Robbers Arrested</h3>
<p>At about 6:30 the night before last, Russian police officer Xue Laofu of the French Police Department, after finishing his duties at the police station, returned to his apartment at No. 275 Avenue Dubail. He was about to have dinner when a friend of Xue, A, told him that there was a suspicious Chinese man outside Room 1 on the ground floor, who was peeping suspiciously. After Xue heard this, he went out to investigate and noticed that there were several men searching drawers in the room where Chen, the manager of the former Jiangnan Bank, lived. Xue knew that they were thieves, so he remained calm and notified the police station by telephone, and immediately went downstairs to question the thief who was on guard at the door. The thief knew that things were not good and turned to escape. Xue was about to chase him when he noticed that another thief had also jumped out of the window. He immediately chased after him. Another thief, seeing this, fired two shots at Xue from the bathroom, but missed. Xue chased him to Avenue des Acres and finally caught the thief. At this time, a large team of Chinese and Western detectives from the police station had arrived at the scene. They learned that there were still remaining thieves hiding in the room, unable to escape. The police officers ordered the thieves in the room to drop their weapons and surrender, but the thieves remained silent. The detectives threw several tear gas grenades into the room from the window, and as a result, three thieves were captured in the room, and a pistol, a Mauser pistol, and all the stolen goods were confiscated.</p>
<p>Three Thieves Punished</p>
<p>Wang Chengying, the Chinese Detective Chief of the Rue Gordon Police Station, and Detective Sun Shaokun arrested three robbers from Hebei, Lin Gengsheng, from Anhui, Huang Youren, and from Fujian, Cheng Songshan, at 1442 Rue Edouard VII on the morning of February 22nd at 9:30 AM. They confiscated two handheld guns and twelve bullets, and together with the suspect, Lu Jie from Hebei, they were taken to the police station and sent to the First Special Court. The police lawyer, Qian Xunjiu, prosecuted them for robbery and was ordered to be detained pending sentencing. Yesterday, Judge Jiang Shuzi presided over the trial and sentenced Lin Gengsheng and Huang Youren each to seven years and six months of imprisonment, Cheng Songshan to nine years, and the guns and ammunition were confiscated. Lu Jie was acquitted.</p>
<p>Repeat Offender Robbery</p>
<p>Zhang Yuhai, a robber from Shandong (66 years old) who regarded prison as his home, was previously sentenced to twelve years in prison for robbery. After his sentence was completed at the end of last year, he and his gang committed five robberies with weapons in the Xiaoshadu Road area. He was arrested by the Central Police Station on the afternoon of the 20th of last month and sent to the First Special Court for trial. Yesterday, Judge Feng presided over the trial and sentenced Zhang Yuhai to ten years of imprisonment, Dong Kaishan to seven years of imprisonment, Qian Zhengyuan, Li Desheng, and Li Rongsheng each to five years of imprisonment, and Xu Heshang, who helped commit the robbery, to two years and six months of imprisonment.</p>
<p>Road Robbery and Injury</p>
<p>Wang Youcai, an unemployed young ruffian, was idle at home and had nothing to do, so he specialized in picking pockets at various stations. At the beginning of this month, he robbed a pedestrian, Chen Qunlin, of several yuan in legal tender at the intersection of Route de Grosse and Route Frelupt, and injured Chen. Passers-by helped to arrest Wang and took him to the police station, and sent him to the First Criminal Division of the Second Special Court. After Judge Sun Pengxian presided over the trial and the facts were confirmed, he sentenced Wang Youcai to two years of imprisonment for robbing other people's movable property in court yesterday morning.</p>
<h3>Milk Company Fined</h3>

<h3>Child Suddenly Disappears on the Way to School; Suspect Zhou Ronghu Arrested; Reportedly Abducted to Hongkou</h3>
<p>Zhou Xisheng, a resident of Changzhou Road, Route Robert, used to run a coppersmith shop in Zhabei. He has a son named Wenzhao, 6 years old. On the afternoon of the 10th of this month, when he and his sister Jinfeng were dismissed from school at the Shenghuo Primary School at 1085 Rue Gordon, his younger brother Wenzhao</p>
<p>Suddenly Disappeared</p>
<p>Searching was fruitless. He returned home and told his father. Jinfeng said that near the school at that time, his brother met Xu Ronghu (14 years old), a fellow villager who was an apprentice in our shop in Zhabei. He gave his brother candy to eat and separated after a while. Perhaps his brother's disappearance was abducted by him. Zhou Xisheng's father then received</p>
<p>Friend's Report</p>
<p>Xu Ronghu is now working at Taiki Coppersmith Shop at No. 120 Dagu Road. He secretly reported the situation to the Putuo Road Police Station, which sent detectives to the address to arrest Xu's apprentice and take him to the police station for detention. Yesterday, he was sent to the First Special Court. The police lawyer Qian Xunjiu elaborated on the case and requested</p>
<p>Adjournment for Investigation</p>
<p>Zhou Xisheng and his daughter Jinfeng then testified about what happened. When questioned, the defendant claimed that the child Zhou Wenzhao was abducted by Zhou's apprentice Xu Genda and taken to a certain place in Hongkou. Judge Jiang Shuzi ordered him to be remanded in custody and rescheduled the hearing.</p>

<h3>Rampant Gambling in Nanshi; Intense Jealousy and Competition Among Peers; Pseudo-Municipal Government Attempts to Seize Gambling Tax</h3>
<p>The English-language "Greater Shanghai Evening Post" reports that it is heard there is a new gambling den on MingGuo Road in Nanshi which has obtained a license from the Japanese authorities. It is scheduled to open on the 15th of this month. By the end of this month, the number of gambling parlors in Nanshi will increase to twenty, which will continue to pay taxes to the Japanese authorities. However, both the "Municipal Government" and other parties are trying to compete for this tax revenue. Recently, a Mr. Yu is said to be willing to pay 3 million per quarter to obtain a complete monopoly on gambling parlors in Nanshi.</p>
<p>Pseudo-bureau gambling dens in various places in Nanshi are springing up like mushrooms after rain, everywhere. Opposite and next door, they compete with each other, resulting in jealousy and open and secret struggles among peers. Cases of murder and theft occur from time to time. The Japanese and puppets turn a blind eye and take the opportunity to squeeze and reap the benefits. Nanshi, which is truly the second most evil land, will have even more unimaginable disasters in the future. The pseudo-bureau gambling dens that have already opened in various places in Nanshi are</p>
<p>Investigated as Follows: Heng'an Company, No. 24 Heng'anfang, Nanyang Bridge; Huasheng Company, No. 44; Xieli Company, No. 24 Wengjia Lane, Old West Gate; Liyuan Club, No. 1, Jiheli Lane, No. 27; Xinsheng Company, No. 79; Dazhong Company, No. 263 Fuyou Road; Baoxing Company, No. 479; Huasen Company, No. 89, Anren Street, Baoren Street; Jinerlai Company, No. 196 Luxiangyuan Road, Jiumudi; Ren'an Entertainment Club, No. 20, Ren'anli Lane, No. 85; Xiejie Company, No. 1, Anrenli, Qinglian Street, Dajing Road; Dali Company, No. 31, Xima Street, Fangbang Road; Nanyuan Company, No. 12, Yiqing Street; Lisheng Entertainment Venue, No. 1, Zhenyeli Lane, No. 1037 MingGuo Road, Xiaobeimen; Leili Company, No. 40 Lusi Street, Dongjiadu, Xiaonanmen, Zhonghua Road. In addition, a certain large gambling den at No. 501 MingGuo Road</p>
<p>Is Nearing Completion; The organizers come to supervise the work every day, hoping to open soon. At the same time, there are countless others preparing to open. However, the Japanese and puppets in Nanshi are currently busy investigating the population, and the so-called citizen certificates or passes for entering and leaving the iron gates will not be abolished in the near future. Although the pseudo-bureau gambling dens have become an open secret, they have not been officially recognized and issued licenses to operate, or they cannot last long. Moreover, the French authorities, in view of the past</p>
<p>Disturbances and Disasters on the Border; The Nanshi gambling dens are adjacent to the concession, so they are deeply concerned and paying attention to their evolution. It is necessary to reconsider the open iron gates, or even close them, to maintain security.</p>
<h3>Social News</h3>
<p>Xiao Zhengzi, 25 years old, works as a laborer and lives in a straw house in Yaoshui Lane, Xiaoshadu Road. At about 6:00 yesterday morning, he took a No. 16516 truck to work somewhere. When the worker was passing the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Muir Road, he planned to get off the bus and go elsewhere. Before the bus stopped, he jumped off the bus, causing him to fall to the ground and have his legs crushed by the wheels. He was sent to Baolong Hospital for treatment, but died before arriving at the hospital.</p>
<p>Li Qing, an 18-year-old worker at the Delong Tobacco Factory at No. 590 Bazilu Road, was accidentally crushed by a machine while working at about 6:00 yesterday morning. His arm was crushed and bleeding profusely. He fell to the ground in extreme pain and fainted. He was sent to Baolong Hospital for treatment, but died soon after due to his serious injuries.</p>
<p>Zheng Shangen, the accountant of the Zai Xinbei Goods Firm at No. 52A, Yanghang Street, French Concession, colluded with apprentices Zhang Minghong and Shen Wenkui to embezzle more than 10,000 yuan in accounts. After the firm's manager Zheng Hegeng discovered it and reported it to the police, the three defendants were arrested one after another, and two accomplices, Yu Chuangen and Shen Baokang, were also detained. They were sent to the First Criminal Division of the Second Special Court. After Judge Sun interrogated them many times, the details were repeatedly recorded in this newspaper. The trial continued yesterday morning. The waiter of No. 12 Shenzhou Hotel was summoned to the court to testify. Since the case was clear, he ordered the debate to be opened and scheduled the sentencing. The defendants were remanded in custody.</p>
<p>At about 11:00 yesterday morning, about 60 or 70 Japanese and puppet military and police suddenly went to Qibao Town in western Shanghai to search residents' shops house by house. All account books were confiscated and pedestrians were inspected. Dozens of people were arrested at the time. The situation was tense for a while, and the villagers fled one after another. The market is now extremely depressed, but gambling dens are open all night long. Opium and morphine are sold everywhere, and daytime robberies are common. It has become a world of all evils.</p>
<p>Shao Sihai, a native of Yangzhou who lives at No. 25 Peifuli, Avenue Lagrene, French Concession, is 60 years old this year. He used to work in the entertainment industry, but retired due to old age and weakness. Recently, he has been troubled by economics and unable to maintain his livelihood, which led to a short-sighted view. On the night of the 11th at 11:00, he secretly swallowed raw opium at home and committed suicide. After his son Shao Yanting discovered it, he was sent to Renji Hospital. Due to his old age and deep poisoning, he died without being rescued.</p>
<h3>Correspondence</h3>
<p>To whom it may concern:</p>
<p>We are writing on behalf of our client, Madam Shi Wu, who states that: "I read a news item in the *Shen Bao* of the 8th of this month entitled 'Shi Lianfu, Owner of a Gunny Sack Shop, Shot.' The article vaguely stated that the shooting was due to his immense profits from managing a gunny sack shop, as well as hoarding rice. This has led the general public and relatives alike to mistakenly believe that patriotic individuals were punishing a treacherous merchant. Such rumors, spreading misinformation, are a great insult. My husband's name is Shi Lifu; various newspapers mistakenly reported it as Shi Lianfu. He was indeed shot near Wuding Road and Macgregor Road around 1 p.m. on the 7th of this month, but unfortunately succumbed to his injuries around 7 a.m. the following morning. The police have thoroughly investigated the matter and have been authorized to strictly pursue the perpetrators. I can confidently assert that it was definitely a vendetta. The rumors about him being a treacherous merchant hoarding rice are completely false. This matter concerns the deceased's reputation, and criminal law has special provisions for protection. Anyone who publicly insults the deceased should bear criminal responsibility. I request your law firm to send a letter to the *Shen Bao* on my behalf to publish a clarification."</p>
<p>Our firm is writing on her behalf as stated above. We request that your esteemed newspaper investigate and grant a clarification. Thank you for your consideration.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>Lawyer Zhang Danping</p>
<p>March 12th</p>
<p>To whom it may concern:</p>
<p>Our client, Mr. Chen Zongdao, states that: "Yesterday, I read a news report that a university student was fraudulently issuing checks, which is inconsistent with the facts. Xi Shaofen's younger brother, Shaolian, Feng Ruizhang, and I are all classmates at Shanghai Law College. Since May 30th of last year, Feng Ruizhang has repeatedly borrowed more than a dozen checks from me, and Feng returned these by cash before their due date. However, two checks totaling 18,000 yuan due on December 28th were not returned. Upon inquiry, he said he needed to borrow two more to cover them. I then signed a check for 18,000 yuan dated January 5th of this year. Unexpectedly, after Feng took the check, all four checks were not returned around the due date. After repeated demands to return the checks were ineffective, Feng Ruizhang personally wrote a statement declaring that he would be fully responsible for any disputes arising from the borrowed checks. He also found a guarantor, responsible for returning the borrowed checks and compensating for all losses. Your esteemed lawyer has already submitted the evidence for review. Therefore, although I am the issuer of the checks, I am also one of the victims in fact. The French Concession authorities are only prosecuting under Article 226 of the Negotiable Instruments Law. However, your newspaper stated that I committed fraud, and that I frequented dance halls, wasted money, and could not make ends meet, which led to the issuance of the checks. This is not the true story, and it is related to my reputation. I request your lawyer to send a letter to clarify these statements." We are urgently sending a letter on behalf of Mr. Chen. It is hoped that a clarification is granted.</p>

<h3>Silk Prices Rise Slightly</h3>
<p>The silkworm season in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces this year is not as good as before. It is now time to decide on purchases, and it is estimated that the harvest will be no more than 40 to 50 percent of the usual amount. Therefore, new silk has not yet entered the market, and the price of old silk is already 22 to 23 yuan per hundred taels, which is higher than last year.</p>
<h3>A Few Words Avert Theft</h3>
<p>In Jinling, at the home of Dr. Yang Li'an in Nima Lane, someone knocked on the door around 10 PM on the tenth day of last month. The maid went to ask who it was, and the person said they needed the doctor. When the door was opened, a masked man holding a knife strode in. The maid tried to scream, but the man tapped her head with the back of the knife and said that if she screamed, he would cut her in two. He then closed the main door and proceeded into the inner room. Yang had two daughters who were chatting in the hall. Suddenly, they saw a masked man holding a knife enter, and they cried out that there was a thief. The elder daughter ran into her room, while the younger daughter ran out the back door, shouting for help. At that time, Yang was washing his feet in his room. Hearing the cries of "thief," he immediately stood up. He saw a man holding a knife enter the room. Yang said to him, "Why did you have to mask your face to come here?" Yang meant that he was not a wealthy household, so why did the thief have to mask his face to rob him? These were words of entreaty. Unexpectedly, the thief mistakenly thought that Yang had recognized his appearance, so he turned around and left. However, he repeatedly slashed the doorframe with his knife, as if to indicate that he would cut anyone who came after him. When the neighbors heard the cries, they came to help, but the thief was nowhere to be found. All they saw was Yang's family, men and women, sitting or standing, all silent and motionless, their eyes unblinking, looking like clay sculptures or wooden carvings, as they had all been scared out of their wits. Alas! How dangerous!</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>A Glorious Memorial for Mr. Zhang Yunhe</h3>
<p>— Wang Yizhi, sent from the Netherlands</p>
<p>Entrusted with history like the paulownia leaf, adorned with plum blossoms in the scholarly world, he followed in the footsteps of the Premier, plotting for the country. Colleagues all admire Mr. Zhang's generosity.</p>
<p>Old dreams of autumn water shields, lingering sorrow like melting snow, he dedicated himself to the revitalization of the *Shen Bao*, after which, the kindness of the elder is still passed down through generations.</p>
<p>The mission of a newspaper is comparable to that of a good historian. In the *Shen Bao* Yearbook of the 22nd year of the Republic of China, Shi Gongliang's words on talent were published, which are still valid today. *Shen Bao* is the oldest Chinese-language daily newspaper. It has been published for sixty-seven years, and the late Mr. Zhang Yunhe has dedicated himself to the newspaper for nearly forty years, occupying a large part of the past history of *Shen Bao*. He was meticulous and unwavering, and not only the entire staff of the newspaper admired him. I remember that twenty-nine years ago, the famous Shanghai publishing expert Mr. Xia Cuifang once said to me, "The newspaper business is very hard work. Fortunately, you are young, but I am afraid that after a few years, your strength will not be enough." However, Mr. Zhang Yunhe and the editors and compilers of the editorial department generally lived in the newspaper office and regarded the newspaper's affairs as their own. They not only enjoyed it but also felt at home. For decades, their life of "lighting lamps at the third watch and hearing the rooster at the fifth" continued day after day. This shows that Shi Gongliang's consideration of talent, generous treatment, and the perfect facilities of the new building have contributed to it. I have visited many large newspaper offices in North America, Western Europe, and Eastern Europe, and I have seen that the reporters on the night shift are at most only two or three people. After 1 a.m., they generally swept the floor and closed the door. I sighed at the time-saving and labor-saving methods of running newspapers in the Western mechanical world, which is far beyond what ordinary people expect, and I deeply admire the self-esteem and perseverance of Chinese intellectuals. I believe that they are enough to represent the ancient civilization of the East and surpass all others in the world. On January 16th, President Chiang sent a telegram from Chongqing to encourage elementary school teachers across the country, saying: "I deeply appreciate that you are serving the country in school classrooms, and the greatness of your work is no less than that of officers and soldiers fighting on the battlefield." I respectfully offer my humble opinions and condolences to the late Mr. Zhang Yunhe, saying: "Scholars working in newspaper offices serve the society, and the grandeur of their careers is greater than that of ambassadors enjoying wealth and honor, and the burden they bear is no less than that of elementary school teachers and officers and soldiers who are steadfast and unyielding." Today, as the melting snow is on the southern branches and sad news spreads, remembering the past rules, I wrote a twenty-five-character couplet to express my love and respect.</p>
<h3>Stealing Books and Visiting Dance Halls</h3>
<p>— Peng</p>
<p>Since tuition and book prices have increased, many appeals and reviews have been published in this journal. In fact, in this environment where everything is controlled and difficulties arise step by step, price increases are naturally unavoidable, but the speculators pushing the tide is also an undeniable fact. This applies to rice and coal; and it also applies to schools and booksellers.</p>
<p>Thus, two types of famine have been created on "isolated islands": hunger for food and hunger for knowledge.</p>
<p>The *Shen Bao*'s social news page on the 11th carried the following news: Sun Yukun, who claimed to be a student at Kaiming Middle School, stole four large volumes of economics and political science books from the Commercial Press on the 8th of this month, worth more than thirty yuan. He was caught by the library's inspectors and handed over to the police. Yesterday, he was sent to the First Special Court. The defendant admitted that he could not afford to buy the books, but he loved the stolen books, so he stole them.</p>
<p>From this news, we can see that the extent of the hunger for knowledge among diligent students is as serious as the hunger of the general poor for food. However, there is still cheap flour and rice for sale, but it is too difficult to find a school and bookstore with affordable tuition and book fees!</p>
<p>Therefore, after we accidentally discovered this news about stealing books, we can imagine how many studious young people have been forced to "drop out of school"! "Stealing books" is as much a crime as "snatching rice." We do feel sorry for Sun Yukun, but his method was wrong. After he completes his detention, he may wish to go to libraries and other places to fill the knowledge he needs, or borrow books from teachers and classmates. An aspiring young man can overcome his difficulties through hard work. Just remember the shame that forced him to drop out of school and steal books; this shame will one day be washed away!</p>
<p>A studious young man steals because he cannot afford books, which can arouse people's sympathy, but stealing is always a kind of shame. However, many students are able to study comfortably in universities, but they would rather go to dance halls, spend money like water, and are unwilling to buy books to increase their knowledge. They waste money earned by their parents' sweat and blood, and waste time that is more valuable than gold. They only bear the title of university students in vain. In this great era, the youth are so depraved, is this not also a kind of shame?</p>
<h3>Improving the Old Apprentice System</h3>
<p>— Zhu Kaiqing</p>
<p>I am a former apprentice. Although I have now escaped that life of suffering, I feel that I should seek some liberation for the apprentices who come after me so that their future can be brightened. Therefore, I sincerely appeal to the masters of the apprentices.</p>
<p>Apprentices must write a contract to the boss for three to five years, like a deed of sale, and within the prescribed learning period, they must obediently endure hardships and learn diligently under the boss's authority. Diligent learning is indeed the foundation of all careers, but after the apprentices enter the shop, there is no real opportunity to fully learn skills. Usually, they are doing things like washing rice, washing vegetables, and even doing lower-level work. Occasionally, in their spare time, the master reluctantly teaches them a little skill, but honestly, how much skill can they learn? I am afraid that in the master's loud scolding, even their souls will be scared away. This is how they live for three to five years, and then they are considered to have completed their apprenticeship. After the boss sets a monthly salary of two or three yuan, they must continue to work in his shop for another year or two to repay the master's kindness. They even have to host a few tables of banquets before they can tear up the contract and freely leave his shop. This system of binding apprentices is too cruel! The bosses certainly benefit a lot, but the apprentices' good youthful time is wasted and meaninglessly taken away by the shopkeepers. We can imagine that these ordinary skills do not require so many years. They can be quickly completed in a short period of one and a half years. This is not only beneficial to the bosses, but also makes a great contribution to society. Therefore, I advise the bosses not to be selfish. They must train apprentices according to the needs of society. This will definitely have good results for both parties. As for improving the old system, there are already examples of modern factories and large shops treating trainees that can be imitated.</p>
<h3>After the Rain, the Sky Clears</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 21: Managing Economic Principles, Mixing Fibrous Substances, Using Machinery to Aid the Achievement of Literary Merit</p>
<p>Shao Huai called Qu Wushuang, and Qu Wushuang said, "Okay! Sister Huihua! I'll come right away." In less than three minutes, she came. The sisters all wanted to see our newspaper office. Because they see the newspaper every day, black words on white paper, flying around in the market, but they don't know how you guys make it. Let's guide them to see a rough outline. We don't need to alarm the people in each department, just the two of us can guide them. The sisters can just take a quick look. Shall we start from the bottom floor?" Qu Wushuang said, "Very good!" Then they took the elevator to the machine room on the lowest floor. This was a large, spacious room, which could be considered a semi-basement. Inside, there were fourteen rotary printing presses. Among these fourteen rotary printing presses, four were American-made, and the remaining ten were produced by Chinese machine factories. In the early years of China's post-war reconstruction, other products were still good, but in terms of machinery, China had to rely on imported goods. Therefore, China often exchanged silk, tea, tung oil, and various agricultural products with various countries for machinery. Later, China's iron mines gradually opened up, and more machine factories were established. Many people who studied mechanical engineering abroad also returned to China. Not only could many machines be imitated from Europe and America, but they could also be designed and create more convenient new models. Therefore, the rotary printing presses used to print newspapers are now made in China. However, the ten rotary printing presses are of different models, because the newspaper office did not purchase them all at once, but gradually added them over time. Each time they purchased a new one, they changed the model, which also gradually improved. These twenty-four rotary printing presses are connected into four major camps. All the printed newspapers have a whole roll of paper placed on the machine, and in just a moment, they are folded neatly. Copies of newspapers are pushed out like waves. This group of sisters arrived at the machine room at 5:45 PM, but they saw that many machines were silent and motionless. Only a very small number of machines were printing the last edition of the evening paper. It turned out that this newspaper office also published evening papers. The evening paper is published three times a day, once at 4 PM, once at 5 PM, and once at 6 PM. Although it is called three times, it does not really change its appearance much, only slightly revised. Because after the evening paper is published at 4 PM, there are still various telegrams arriving from various places after 4 PM, so the important news is added to the following two editions.

<h3>Lament for High Prices in New Shanghai (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Tu Shouzhuo</p>
<p>In this era of chaos and confusion, where right and wrong are reversed, prices soar, and a great wind sweeps through, striking the dying common people. Remember these folk rhymes, and feel the endless emotions.</p>
<p>The elite protect and receive honor, monopolizing and hoarding, unwilling to release their goods. Rice is over fifty yuan per stone. How can ordinary people fill their stomachs?</p>
<p>Coal briquette prices are unprecedentedly high. It is difficult to prepare cooked food in this country. Five cents for five, how can one slowly start a fire? Southern people's love for sweets has not changed, and they still value sweetness and flavor. The price of a jade basin is no longer comparable to before. A catty of sugar costs six jiao.</p>
<p>Cotton yarn merchants are good at speculation, following others' footsteps swiftly. A chi of Ge linen sells for seven jiao, making common clothes more expensive than silk.</p>
<p>Cooking oil is the third most important thing when opening the door. It is difficult to save on cooking oil. Different foods, raw vegetables, and beans, each cost over a hundred yuan per hundred catties.</p>
<p>Every night, I go to the market to buy cheap wine. A small amount in a half-catty pot costs two cents. Compared to the price of the past, it is more than doubled!</p>
<p>The merchants still say the price is low. Five yuan buys a chicken. This scares poor people. Forget about killing a chicken to entertain guests!</p>
<p>Wearing cloth shoes all year round, worth ten yuan, a foreign brand. The price changes three times each, and the quality is still worse than before.</p>
<p>Every household keeps vigil with double red candles, burning inch by inch into ashes. This year, the price of candles is three times higher than before, ten jiao per ten taels.</p>
<p>For ancestral offerings during the New Year, burning silver foil is a traditional custom. Each stack of a thousand sheets, arranged in a "nine-nine" string, costs three yuan and three jiao, a new price.</p>
<p>The price of meat at the end of the year is shocking. One and a half yuan per market catty. Four cents buys sliced ham, thin as autumn clouds.</p>
<p>It is difficult to find delicious food. Green tea is better than chicken and pork. Who would believe it if they hadn't seen it with their own eyes? Each four market catties sell for one yuan.</p>
<p>Every day, I sigh at the poverty of my spotted bamboo pen. The price of pens is high, making it difficult to buy them. What is the price of a sheep's hair brush? Three jiao per piece, and the quality is still simple.</p>
<p>Children have other snacks to eat for leisure. Fragrant beans and peanuts cannot be omitted. At least two cents in a paper bag, not enough to chew heartily and not smile.</p>
<h3>Condolences for Cai Yuanpei</h3>
<p>— Hu Shanyuan</p>
<p>The world praises the wise man Wang Anshi, everyone weeps for the scholar Su Shi.</p>
<h3>Citizens of the Kingdom of Heaven (Part 2)</h3>
<p>Like this person, with learning, cultivation, everyone believed in his morality. Everyone envied his respectability, everyone acknowledged his broad knowledge of the Bible, and he himself believed that he was a first-class citizen of the Kingdom of Heaven. Jesus acknowledged his achievements, but solemnly told him that he was not yet close to the Kingdom of Heaven, and that he must continue to work hard. Again, a wealthy young man walked to Jesus and asked Jesus a big question, "What should I do to inherit eternal life?" Jesus replied, "You must love the Lord your God with all your heart, all your soul, and all your strength. Second, love your neighbor as yourself. This is the greatest commandment in the law." The young man said calmly and humbly, "I have kept these commandments from my youth." This is the truth, not bragging. He had walked a long way to the Kingdom of Heaven, but Jesus told him that he still had to work hard. Jesus said, "There is still one thing you have not done. You must go and sell all your possessions and give to the poor." When the young man heard this, he felt very sad and left, because he had many possessions. And the path to true joy and happiness was blocked by his possessions. The two people mentioned above were not far from the Kingdom of Heaven, but they stopped and did not go any further. Therefore, today we must recognize the true qualifications for being citizens of the Kingdom of Heaven. We cannot be "almost" Christians, nor can we be "almost" good people. Today is a scientific world, and everything emphasizes precision. Six sixes are thirty-six, which is mathematical precision, and will never vary due to friendship. No matter what psychology, it cannot change it. The same is true for other music, chemistry, and physics. Jesus believes that religion is also the same, with great laws governing it. Musicians do not think that the harmony of music limits their freedom, but it guides them to the ultimate peak of beauty. Engineers abide by the rules of their profession, and then the machines will operate in a certain pattern. Similarly, we may not easily follow the laws that govern the conduct of people in the world, but they can make our lives reliable. All moral and spiritual limitations are to make our morals progress and protect us from falling. These laws are the boundaries of the Kingdom of Heaven, and they are also the qualifications for being citizens of the Kingdom of Heaven. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>The Singing Postures of Chinese Movie Stars</h3>
<p>— Ji Yan</p>
<p>Since the advent of sound films, almost all female movie stars can sing. Now I will write about the singing postures of several well-known female movie stars:</p>
<p>Hu Die and Chen Yanyan stand steadily and quietly. After singing, they show no particular expression and are extremely humble, with a style that is very much that of well-bred ladies. The tone of the two is particularly broad and high, so any tone, whether high or low, is never a problem for them.</p>
<p>Li Lili sings and plays casually, as if nothing is happening. After singing, if she feels satisfied, she jumps with both feet. Otherwise, she shouts, "That doesn't count! That definitely doesn't count!"</p>
<p>Chen Yunshang and Li Minghui are like monkeys in the mountains and orioles in the sky when they sing, full of vigor, just like children. But when they are quiet, they are as silent as researchers. Sometimes they have to attend to other people's conversations while singing. Their five senses and four limbs work at the same time, but they never sing the wrong notes.</p>
<p>Li Lilian said, "Recording a record is as painful as giving birth, but after recording it, it is as refreshing as if I had given birth." Indeed, because the songs she sings are all very fast and difficult tunes, and the music is particularly complex. Only she can handle it.</p>
<p>Hu Shan is so cheerful and straightforward. As soon as she arrives, without even opening her mouth to sing, she sends a symbol of "universal joy" and "peace in the world."</p>
<p>Gong Qiuxia still retains the demeanor of a child. She likes to sing children's marches the most. Before singing, she must give a child-like smile to the friends around her. When she sings happily, she sticks out her tongue. When she is unhappy, she frowns.</p>
<p>Tan Ying's singing is as expressive as her acting, with her eyebrows, eyes, mouth, hands, waist, legs, and feet all helping out.</p>
<p>All of the above-mentioned stars always use their fingers to mark the beats when they sing. The weight of the beats and the intonation of the tune are expressed on their fingers.</p>

<h3>After Watching "Li Xiucheng's Martyrdom"</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>The rise of the "Taiping Heavenly Kingdom" was the prelude to the Chinese national revolution. Due to the corruption of the Qing government at the time and the suffering of the people, this explosive revolutionary spark started from the Jintian Village uprising and went all the way down. It can be said that it was unstoppable. However, after establishing Nanjing as the capital, they were content with the current situation and fell into the contradictions of "divine power." The suspicion and jealousy among the four kings deepened the difficulties of the battle. After Li Xiucheng's proposal to move the capital was rejected by shortsighted people, he could only lead his brothers and sisters, who "could take them to a way of life," to be trapped in a "dead city." Although Li Xiucheng failed, it is not an excuse for defeatists. His failure was determined by historical conditions. In the first act, the playwright fully explained the pros and cons of moving the capital, but Li Xiucheng, in order to be loyal to the imperial court and deeply love the children in the city, could only fight more bravely and arduously, hoping that the reinforcements from Huzhou would be able to relieve the difficulties of Nanjing. His death will inspire countless Li Xiucheng's to rise up one after another.</p>
<p>Therefore, "Li Xiucheng's Martyrdom" is the same as "Regret Over the Ming Dynasty." What the playwright tells us is a lesson: a comparison between betrayal and loyalty. Ge Nenliang's death after scolding the rebels and Li Xiucheng's righteous spirit are exactly the examples we need now.</p>
<p>"Li Xiucheng's Martyrdom" is divided into four acts: In the first act, Li Xiucheng insists on moving the capital; in the second act, the people in the city cooperate to defend it to the death; in the third act, the people continue to make persistent efforts; and in the fourth act, Li Xiucheng generously gives his life. Although the writing is quite rough, the rendering of Li Xiucheng's wisdom and courage and the reasons why the "Taiping Heavenly Kingdom" failed are still meticulous. What is even more lovable is the three cups of wine that Li Xiucheng raises in the fourth act, which is touching and makes people cry.</p>
<p>Yan Jun's Li Xiucheng is calm and firm, and his enunciation is clear. Compared with Wu Sangui, he has made more progress.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes from the Pear Garden</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>Remembering Liu Hongsheng's Sudden Death (Part 1)</p>
<p>Back then, besides Wang, Tan, and Sun, there were also the Wang Xiaonong and Liu Hongsheng schools of old male role (xusheng) performance. They were once very popular in major cities across the country. While they generally followed Gui Fen's singing style, they were known for writing their own new plays and incorporating fast tempos and flowing melodies. Therefore, his performances in Shanghai caused quite a sensation. The performers in Shanghai have always been happy to support famous performers from the south; when Xiaonong was with the Dan Gui First Stage, he once sang "Zhang Song Presents the Map," and even had Luo Xiaobao, San Mazi, and Feng Zhikui play the insignificant roles of Liu Bei, Guan Yu, and Zhang Fei in the play. This, of course, attracted more audiences and increased Xiaonong's value. In addition, there was Liu Hongsheng's performance of the "Complete Empty City Stratagem" at the Great Stage. Apart from Mei Rongzhai, who he brought as a supporting actor, being unremarkable, the strangest things were Zhao Ruquan's cross-dressing as the old soldier and Yao Junqing's portrayal of the messenger. Because the audience was so large that time, I arrived late and bought two stage-side seats to hear more clearly. Fortunately, Liu the Lame's acting had nothing to offer, and most listeners focused on his good voice. Dozens of stage seats were directly facing the city tower, so it was truly clear.</p>
<p>Hong Sheng originally sang Black Face roles, and it was Mu Fengshan's guidance, obtained from selling small knives, that made him abandon business for performance. Later, he got the nickname "Little Knife Liu," and this was the reason. When he came to Shanghai to perform, Li Chunlai greatly despised him as a person, and his share of the roles was particularly small. At that time, he was really down and out. Not long after, the troupe suddenly lacked an old male role, and no one could replace him. A friend among his colleagues who was close to Hong Sheng knew that he had privately studied old Tan's style in Beijing. "Empty City Stratagem" and "Hongyang Cave" were indeed full of flavor, and at the same time, he could also handle several Wang Mao plays such as "Beating the Golden Branch" and "Jinshui Bridge" in one go. So, he suggested it to Chunlai, and he was replaced, and surprisingly, the show was a sell-out and very popular. From then on, his value rose, and his roles became longer. However, Chunlai could no longer keep him. After returning north, he almost competed against old Tan. Those who wanted to hear the flavor went to old Tan, and those who wanted to hear the voice all went to Liu the Lame. From then on, he never touched his Black Face roles.</p>
<h3>Zhou Jianyun Talks About Recent Film Industry</h3>
<p>— Haixing</p>
<p>Mr. Zhou Jianyun was the former manager of the Star Film Company. He determined the production direction of the Xiansi Temple, and opened up overseas distribution channels. Mr. Zhou was truly a distinguished contributor in the process of the Chinese film industry's development from its infancy to its current scale. After the war, he retired to his hometown and has had no activities. Recently, the reporter met Mr. Zhou and asked about the current state of the Chinese film industry. His reply was as follows: (1) The box office revenue of domestic films after the war is truly unprecedented. It is now commonplace for a new film to earn 40,000 to 50,000 yuan during its first-run release. Even second and third-run theaters often exceed the first-run theaters' revenue before the war. Before the war, except for films like "Sister Flowers" which had particularly good box office revenue, the average income of a film in Shanghai was about 20,000 yuan. Compared to now, the difference is very, very large. As for other cities, because the currency prices in the Philippines and Hong Kong have risen, the income of producers has also greatly increased. Although raw materials have also risen at the same time, the production time has been shortened and efforts are made to save money everywhere, so there is a surplus compared to before the war. (2) The popularity of costume dramas is due to the fact that overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia welcome these works. At present, some costume dramas seem to be a bit too sloppy. If this continues, putting aside everything else, even in terms of business, I am afraid it will be difficult to sustain. When he said this, Mr. Zhou looked extremely regretful.</p>
<h3>Theater News</h3>
<p>— Xiang</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Art and Drama Society announced its establishment, actors such as Qin Lian, Tao You, Chen Zhong, Xue Rong, and Huang Fang from Guohua Film have joined, making the cast quite impressive. On the 17th of this month, they will be invited by the Lone Army Drama Troupe to perform for the second time. They may officially perform in mid-next month.</p>
<h3>Leisurely Sketches Inviting the Arts (27) String Music</h3>
<p>— Written by Dongyun, Illustrated by Youyan</p>
<p>String music has two types: "Danxian" (single string) and "Sanxian" (three strings). It is certainly very difficult to play operas encompassing sheng (male), dan (female), jing (painted-face male), and chou (clown) roles on a few unchanging strings! Because it sounds a little monotonous, in recent years, "string music" performances are often accompanied by a young girl's clear singing.</p>
<p>Most string music performers are blind. Being careless and impetuous will definitely not work for this skill.</p>
