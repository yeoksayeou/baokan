<h3 id="c14">浙東軍事 <a href="#c14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>日本最近的外交攻勢，因美國堅拒續訂商約而顯然碰了壁；政治攻勢則高陶揭布所謂妥協文件，無異於射放了一個魚雷；同時還有軍事攻勢在浙東，徒見其為强弩之末。本月廿一日下午六時，杭州方面的日軍，乘大雪紛飛，由重砲火掩護之下，從南星橋渡江，在蕭山江邊六百畝地方登陸。登陸以後，分東南兩路；南路沿浙贛路綫，意在取得臨浦楓橋，進窺諸暨金華，佔據浙省抗戰重心。東路擬藉錢淸鎭為據點，先奪紹興，繼犯寗波；一方面以牽制華軍側面襲擊，鞏固其南犯浙贛路綫的形勢；一方面則在截斷浙江沿海（尤其是寗波）和內地交通的孔道。同時，又沿富江綫，發動富陽方面的攻勢，以進窺新登桐盧，而與錢江南岸的隊伍互相策應；如情勢許可，則當以會師金華為其最後目標。此外，尚有消極作用，則在緩和華軍對太湖區域的攻勢；蓋沿滬杭路一帶，如嘉興西南鄕新村等地，近來都有華方開來生力軍參加戰鬥，迭予日軍重創；日軍向錢江南岸採取攻勢，自有其牽制錢江北岸華軍的意義。</p>
<p>本來自京滬滬杭綫各據戰淪陷後，整個戰局的重心，早已西移；浙東戰事有如「蝸角之爭，」無關全局勝負；即如日方近日所聲明，亦稱進窺浙東的目的，並非在於佔領地點，乃在予華方游擊隊以打擊，並確保滬杭附近治安云云；如此公開的說明其戰略，當然別有用意，然亦可由此證明浙東戰事在整個戰局上，並無多大價値。但因浙東貼近上海，經濟上的聯繫比較密切，而上海居民籍隸浙東的當在一百萬人左右，所以自「七七」以來倖免蹂躪的浙東半壁，一旦傳出告急警報，特別為上海所注意。</p>
<p>自日軍渡江迄今，已有一週，最初因交通阻梗，情勢混沌，以致謠諑繁興，人心惶恐；現在事實眞相逐漸明瞭，足以證實該方軍事局面，一時決不至於何種惡化。謠言雖多，不可置信，可信的確訉有待相當日纔會到上海。當然，我們並不願故作樂觀論調；相反的，我們承認除了全盤戰局以外，浙東的遭刦，亦自有其相當的嚴重性。日軍如不惜慘重犧牲，不計利害得失，則奪取浙東並非絕對不可能。</p>
<p>就日軍渡江以後的戰况看來，我們覺得日軍此次雖是出之以有計劃的行動，但並沒有不恤慘重犧牲的決心。蓋浙東得失旣屬無關全局！而滬杭失守，錢江禁渡，海岸被封鎖以後，浙東各港的呑吐作用復大受限制；因此之故，破壞浙江沿海和內地交通的意義，隨之减少。然則以重大代價爭取浙東，是否値得，大堪疑問。當然，日軍茍能兵不血刃，一鼓而下寗紹，再舉而取金華，搜括浙東精華，或於以戰養戰，不無裨補，同時佔據浙江抗戰重心誠何樂而不為？無奈事實上決不如此容易。因為目前向浙東深入，無論就天時地理人和各方面說，皆與日軍絕對不利。浙東雖非朔北，但時當冬令，天氣亦嚴寒砭骨，且河渠縱橫，阡陌交織，風雪載道，路途泥濘，行軍困難，自在意中。蕭山以西，諸暨楓橋一帶，更是崇山峻嶺，而寗紹所屬之各險要地點，以及富陽江上游，華軍早於二年前布置堅强工事！勢難飛越。比較容易攫取的還是限於海軍活動範圍內的沿江海而已。倘若離了海軍范圍，則在日軍又蹈孤軍深入之危，而華軍勁旅尤可一呼而集，即如數日以來，沿浙贛路北開的湘軍，已逾五萬，連同地方抗日自衛團，省保衛團，儘夠予日軍以痛擊；而此一戰區內的軍民長官，更是能征慣戰，忠貞効命的一時之選。士氣奮發，軍民融洽，決不給日軍輕佔便宜。有此種種，日軍始將望而却步；若冒險深入，必須慘重犧牲。據前昨戰訉，日軍自蕭山出發，進犯東南兩路，皆被華軍擊退，銳氣大挫；自富陽西窺新登的日軍亦已全部潰散，華軍已乘勝越過鳳凰山而進逼富陽，足見一時緊張的浙東戰局，已有好轉模樣；日本軍部所謂「業已停止追擊」，其藉口措辭不必問，但浙東日軍的「停止」，必近乎事實吧！</p>

<p>軍官登輪實施搜查</p>
<p>永生輪旋從日艦之令、駛近該艦、而於六時五十三分復下碇、至七時零五分、即有日軍官一員偕同能操華語之韓人或臺灣人一名充作舌人、及武裝水兵二十一名、相率登永生輪、巴登令船員以永生輪之登記證出示日軍官、然後被盤問、日軍官欲施搜查、巴登雖加反對、不能終免、被查約半小時、但對貨物、則未施檢查、</p>
<p>勒令停泊言詞威脅</p>
<p>事畢、日軍官復向巴登盤詰、問已否「聞得淺間丸事件、」巴登答未聞之、日軍官乃陳述淺間丸被英艦一艘攔阻、押去德籍旅客二十人事、日軍官旋請巴登書面聲明日兵係得船長許可、而施搜查、巴登加以拒絕、謂渠僅願書明永生輪係在反對之下被搜查者、日軍官見巴登不允、乃囑不得令輪前駛、否則日艦將開砲轟擊、至十一時四十五分、日軍官率隊離輪、</p>
<p>書面聲明始得放行</p>
<p>當日午夜與翌晨六時零五分、永生輪兩度發無綫電致日　、要求准予前駛、均遭日艦拒絕、至晨間七時四十五分、日軍官復率舌人一小士兵三、登永生輪、吿巴登稱、渠若書面聲明曾許日方搜查該輪、則准前行、巴登無奈、遂書面聲明、日兵搜查時、秩序井然、並未觸犯旅客、但搜查前、未得船長許可等語、永生輪旣已放行、乃於晨間四時四十五分起椗、十一分鐘後破浪前進云、</p>
<p>英海軍擬向日交涉</p>
<p>據英海軍當局吿記者稱、「此事刻正向日當局交涉中、」英領署當局、昨亦接得報吿、但目前尙無行動、且非接英大使館訓令、則不知將取何種行動、按永生輪自一九三八年八月間在香港造成後、迄今十八個月、已三度遭日艦攔阻、又大陸報云、聞諸可靠方面、英當局對於日方搜查永生輪事、擬於今日（二十七日）向日當局提出抗議、</p>

<p>以防不測、並為避免延宕起見、派出高級警官往晤日當局、商定後備隊需要時可派往蘇州河北岸、並規定警務處人員在工廠內部辦理一切、而日軍陸戰隊則在工廠外</p>
<p>維持治安</p>

<p>製造化妝品，肥皂，及牙膏等工業，亦有顯著進步。新造之廠房及里弄房屋多幢，均經此等工廠使用。製造牙膏錫管之工業，亦隨同發展，錫管用之裝盛本地所製或目國外整簡進口而就地分裝之牙膏。此類工廠，計有五家，每日產額，總計十一萬枚。玻璃廠紛紛趕製玻璃瓶，以備就地裝盛化妝品，俾應本埠或海外顧主之需要，並將玻璃瓶出品直接運至海外銷售。工業區內化妝品銷路之增加，使本埠所製出品之需要，隨之俱增。提煉薄荷油及製造薄荷錠之工廠七家，業經開辦，此兩種出品已在美洲覓得市場，鄉間農民，正在種植薄荷，希望所獲利益，比他種農產為厚。</p>
<p>其他工業　玻璃業工廠除製造化粧品瓶外，工作清淡，此類工廠，大小併計約一百餘家，設備簡陋，難於改進。搪資業工廠所用原料，價格飛漲，其中多種（包括黑鋼板，）須自國外運入，但具營業，仍極興旺，有數家曾因舶來品原料價格過高，暫時減少產額。橡皮鞋業全年清淡，自外匯緊縮以後，物價增高，本埠銷路，大受影響，且所有橡皮鞋出品，經視作軍需用品，因此不能運往各淪陷區域。僅有蘇州河以北之工廠數家，可與長江流域交易。有一家已開始用浸漬法製造橡皮質物品，其衛係由猶太難民傳入。此外如外科用品，汽球，及橡皮寬緊帶，亦為此等工廠之新出品。某新工廠在製造皮球。熱水瓶廠營業發達，結果能自建新式廠房以代從前設於里弄中之工場者，計有兩家，海外銷路，遠至菲列濱，馬來亞，南洋羣島以及美洲等處，其出品不在新加坡政府禁止之旬，故前途至堪樂觀。造紙及紙質品之工廠，其有七家，其中五家為戰後新設者，每日平均產量，有六七·五噸，大宗出品，運銷印度及南洋羣島等處。從前設於閘北之電簡廠一家。已在租界內復工，····用工人約兩百名。製造電燈泡之新式工廠一家，亦已開工。電珠業工廠，其有三十三家，其中大都於上年間崛興，（未完）</p>

<p>— 逸</p>
<p>軸心的成立和分裂</p>
<p>站在戰爭漩渦外面的黑衣宰相索里尼，似乎近來已成了歐洲政治舞台上幫襯的閑角。除開由他的喉舌「意大利人民報」時常傳出稍為響亮的呼聲外、長久沒有看到他的驚人的舉動。誰都要問：意大利是不是永遠在這半睡眠的狀態下度過這次歐洲的危機呢？不然的話，那未意大利究採取那條路徑呢？與德國重尋舊好，遠是與英法交歡呢？從第二次歐戰發生後，墨索里尼的外交舉措上看來，他的外交，可說八面玲瓏，不着一些痕跡。說他依附以前的另一軸心—德國，為然已不對，說他反對德國，幫助英法，根本也不是這同事。從幾年前的意大利外交講，不錯，意大利是與德國結合，一致反對英法的。不過歐洲兩個軸心國家的結合，是暫時的交相利用，而不是永久的伴侶。意大利的基本政策，是在中歐獲得霸權，她因此寗願前奧匈帝國分裂開來的小國永遠在混亂對立的狀態，使它可以在背後索線，有時聯甲以制乙，有時聯乙以制甲，而不願勢力雄厚的德國，伸張了她的勢力到意大利邊境的伯倫隘。可是以前墨索里尼要把意大利王國，變成功意大利帝國，把地中海變成「我們的海」，於是調兵遣將侵入了阿比西尼亞，意大利帝國是造成了，可是意大利在國際上變了一個光桿。因此飢不擇食，找到了希特勒，成立了軸心。這軸心觀念的形成，據說是出於她的愛女艾達的主張，而是由他的愛婿齊亞諾出馬促成的。艾達齊亞諾，過去為簽訂這項條約，曾親赴柏林，訪問德國國社黨要人。結果柏林羅馬軸心，雖告成立，可是意大利所付的代價却屬不小。在一九三八年的三月，墨索里尼眼睜看着希特勒把奧地利從他的手中奪去。六個月後，他又幫助他的伙伴在慕尼墨協定中侵入捷克，而他仍一無所獲。一九三九年三月，希特勒一旣一口呑併了捷克，順便又將來米美爾攫取在手後，意大利才將阿爾巴尼亞拿到手中，意大利這時才吃到一點甜頭。希特勒經過了幾次的呑併而沒有遇到障碍，他的食慾愈大了。最後他又把屠刀加於波蘭的頭上，墨索里尼於是向他警告，說這次動不得了，再動要引起戰爭。可是希特勒沒有接受他的警告，果然大戰爆發，墨素里尼在戰事發生後，沒有覆行德意軍事同盟的義務，柏林羅馬軸心，也就此壽終正寢。</p>
<p>意大利的新策略</p>
<p>意大利對德雖沒有實行軍事同盟規定的義務，可是齊亞諾一直到最近，還宣稱努力支持德國，這就是講，德意的關係，還是藕斷絲連。可見意大利的不加入戰爭，並不是幫助英法之謂。反之她的這樣的手段，正是對英法要挾的一個好策略。在上面已經講到，意大利雖然已把王國變為帝國，可是把地中海變為「我們的海」的企圖，還沒有實現。因此意大利念念不忘於從英法獲得菲洲殖民地。法西代言人蓋達已經指出「意大利期望殖民地問題的解決。意大利為凡爾賽條約的意圖，意國希望殖民地自由平等解決…所以墨索里尼採取武裝而和平的政策…」這公開的宣言，這出了意大利的肺腑，這就是講意國獲得了中歐的覇權，還嫌不夠，必得殖民地而後已。這就是意大利對雙方都表示好感，對雙方都提出利益的要求的原因。</p>
<h3 id="c115">探險家斯文赫定　向希特勒提和平計畫 <a href="#c115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>— 菊</p>
<p>說起斯文赫定（Sven　Hedin），想來大家未曾忘記，他是一全瑞典的探險家，前幾年曾在我國西北勘察產，報上常常提起他的大名的。最近他在德國柏林向希特勒貢獻他的和平計劃。據他對人說：</p>
<p>「我的和平建議的唯一目的是救護文化與文明。這些在長期戰爭中一定被毀壞。」</p>
<p>「我的希望即刻到倫敦去一趟，貢獻我的劃計於張伯倫及其他政府要人，甚或英皇喬治，如果可能的話。</p>
<p>「不過估計目前的形勢，不得不暫時放棄這個主意，因為成功之望頗少。惟和平計劃業已送云，希望能在英國發表。</p>
<p>據說他的和平計劃是參見希特勒後才發生的。他對於荷比和呼籲，以為目前雖無成功之望，但努力不懈，必能達到目的。</p>
<p>查斯文赫定從上次大戰以前直到現在，沒有去過英國。大戰時是一位熟心助德反英宣傳家，現在却反布爾雪維克了，希望德英聯起來對俄。</p>

<p>— 泰隆</p>
<p>在阿根廷的博勒頓阿的附近地方，有一個世界上獨一無二的城市，名叫「希望城」，住在這城裏的居民都是在從前失業的人，因為得不到救濟，所以他們就到這河岸邊來，搭了許多小屋，過着集團的生活。</p>
<p>他們各人集合了以前自己的儲蓄費，買有騾馬等，每人分組輪流到市上去做買賣，換取各種糧食回來，有時捉此鳥獸來作為小菜，並在屋舍的附近種植了許多美麗的花草，每天拿到市上去賣給太太們。</p>
<p>在這個城裏，有一條很有趣的章程，就是居住在這城裏的居民，各人不准娶妻子，以免除與妻子爭吵的煩惱，而這裏的居民的大都遵守這個定章的。</p>
<p>他們的團結力很好，平時沒有互相爭鬥的事發生，亦不會做違反國家律法的事情，所以這個城裏用不到繁榮來維持秩序。</p>

<p>— 怡怡館主</p>
<p>「爲什麼」　三個字，可以增進你的學問知識。只要你能够不怕問，不恥問，時刻的不忘用這「為什麼」三個字來，以求解釋你的疑案。</p>
<p>譬如：你做算術，無論是加减乘除，以及幾何；三角；代數等算題，必有使你懷疑的地方，那你便該用「爲什麼」三個字去請敎你的師長或父兄。「爲什麼」要這樣算，「爲什麼」要用這樣的公式？再如：電燈「爲什麼」會亮？電話「爲什麼」會傳話？無綫電「爲什麼」會播音？飛機「爲什麼」會飛？諸如此類的問題，你如果能够常常用「爲什麼」三個字，向你的師長或父兄請敎，你便可以得到許多的學問知識。</p>
<p>因爲，「學問」這兩個字，我們顧名思義的想一想，便知道「學」與「問」，是有連帶密切的關係的。換句話說，便是大凡學一樣東西，必有一樣東西的疑問。要解釋疑問，便得好問。「爲什麼」如此？「爲什麼」這樣？如果，只知道「學」，而不知道「問」。那不但得不到「學」的益處，並且還徒費時間與精力。道是最愚笨的事情！</p>
<p>總而言之，「學無止境」，我希望諸位親愛的小朋友們，無論是在學校裏，家庭間，社會上，對於一切有所懷疑不懂的地方，要隨時隨地的不怕問，不恥問，用「為什麼」這三個字來以求問題的解答，那我想你們的學問知識，定是日進無疆的。</p>
<h3 id="c121">岳飛安貧的故事 <a href="#c121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>— 沈錫身</p>
<p>諸位小朋友：古人有一句格言說道：「貧苦不能移」。意思是說，一個人雖在貧苦窮困的當兒，却不能因此喪失志氣，而仍要保持大節，這倒的確不是一件容易的事情呢！我如今說一件「貧苦不能移」的故事給諸位聽聽；那人就是中國歷史上的大偉人，宋朝的名將岳飛。却說岳飛沒有做元帥以前，曾在汴京（現在的河南開封）搶挑了小梁王，大鬧武塲之後，便暫時閒守在家中，那年適逢旱荒，米糧騰貴，岳飛一家數口，不免度日艱難，一班結義的兄弟們，因爲難以安貧竟出去搶刦。但岳飛是很有志氣的，他寗可貧苦，不願做那非法之事，所以不但沒有參加，而且因了勸他們不醒，就與衆兄弟斷絕交往，却一家數口，苦守淸貧的度日了。</p>
<p>後來洞庭湖上的大盜魁楊么，知道岳飛很有本領，又在窮困之境，就派王佐帶了許多金銀財物來請岳飛去做「大元帥」，起初王佐不將眞情說出，到後來岳飛明白了他是楊么所差　來的，就立刻將金銀財物如　退回，並且對他說：「我岳飛　是宋朝人，死是宋朝鬼，焉有背國投賊，做那不忠不義之事，請你去轉吿你們大王，今生休再想我岳飛去投他了。」那王佐見岳飛的態度非常堅决，祇得拿了金銀，很沒趣的走了。</p>
<p>諸位小朋友，岳飛雖在貧苦時，他不但不作非分之想，並且金銀財物也不能打動他的心，這樣的高風亮節，多麼値得我們欽仰呀！後來到底做了宋朝的大元帥！</p>

<p>— 蘇明</p>
<p>庸兒的學校裏放了寒假已有好多天了。每天的上午，他總照着他自定的課程表做他的工作—寫字，讀書…一個整整的上半天便很快的過去了。吃了中飯之後，便閒得沒有事可做，走出門去玩玩，可是這幾天來，戶外的氣候是冷得相當的可怕。</p>
<p>「哥哥，外面眞冷，躲在家裏怪悶氣的，有什麼好玩的玩意兒大家來玩玩？」庸兒向他哥哥宗兒這樣的問着。</p>
<p>「有什麼沒有？而且這個遊戲是非常的簡便，我們每個人差不多天天都在玩着，不過大家却都沒有注意到。你先去想一想，假使猜不着，我來吿訴你。」宗兒聽到了他弟弟的問話，細細地想了一下，便笑嘻嘻的說。</p>
<p>「那是一定猜不到的，你快吿訴我，不要賣關子了，快說呀！」</p>
<p>「你想也不想，怎麼說猜不到，不要時時貪懶，不去用你的腦力，要知多用了腦力，也可以訓練訓練這個良好的習慣，將來便感覺到有莫大的功用。」宗兒眼見得庸兒是這樣的心急，便更吊吊他的胃口。於是席兒才沉默了一下，他當然是不會猜到的。</p>
<p>宗兒便去拿了一隻椅子，叫庸兒坐了下來，更使他的軀幹挺直，兩隻脚平直地放在地上，庸兒弄得莫明其妙，依着他哥哥的話做去，不知道是怎麼一回遊戲？到得他聽得哥哥「站起來…」的半句話，便毫不費力的把身子斜了一斜的站了起來，這有什麼好玩？</p>
<p>那知他哥哥說道：「不對，不對，我的話還沒有說完。你再坐下來，聽我的話做去；身子不許傾斜，兩足不准移動，你且試試站起來看。」他說完了這話，便使他弟弟的身子不能傾斜。而庸兒心想這很容易，便想站起來，那知在事實上他直了身子却始終站不起來。這是什麼道理？</p>
<p>「這是個物體重心的問題。我們立着的人所以不倒下來，因爲他的由重心牽制的垂直綫無形上通過我們身體的內部，便不致倒下來，如那垂直綫出了我們的身體，便要跌倒。而你坐着的人，你的重心是軀體內部，相近於背脊骨的地方，由此點出發的垂直綫通過椅子，在兩脚跟的後面，你要站起來，就應把這直縣移到兩脚的中間，因此就把身體前傾，把重心移過，或者把脚移到後面去，這是我們通常從椅子上站起來的習慣。那垂直綫是我們假想的而來解釋這個問題。倘若你不把身子傾斜，一輩子也站不起來。這個遊戲不是很簡單的嗎？可是我們從沒有想到過的。」</p>

<p>— 龍駒生</p>
<p>小朋友們，在民族鬥爭的血花裏，又完畢了一學期的課程了。這幾天，大家正在吃，喝，玩，遊，的快樂假期中，大多數的孩子，都把功課丟在腦後了。小朋友們！你們要記取父母兄長在非常時期裏，物價高壓之下，栽培你們是不容易的呀！</p>
<p>我來貢獻給小朋友們，怎樣利用寒假的辦法。那就是舉行「學童觀摩會」邀約你們的同學，會集攏來，共同商兌學課，將國，英，算，公民，常識等，重新溫習一遍，務須多讀，多看，多作，古語說得好，「獨學而無友，則孤陋而寡聞。」又說：「以文會友，以友輔仁，」蓋他山之石，可以攻玉，至聖先師如孔子，猶說：「三人行，必有我師焉，」他老人家，詢「官名」於郯子，訪「樂」於「萇宏」學琴於師襄，問「周禮」於老子，那樣爲學孜孜不倦，你們應該要取法的，唐代韓愈氏也說：「……是故弟子不必不如師，師小必賢於弟子，聞道有先後，術業有專攻，如是而已，……」小朋友們，記着吧！同學之中，有聰敏的，也有愚笨的，有愚笨而知苦學的，也有聰敏而荒唐的，那麼你們在觀摩會中，可以互相勉勵，互相指示，拋棄遊戲的念頭，而埋頭在書本中，不單是讀死書，還要引證活的材料，活的實騐，功課纔有進步。筆者幼年時代的死讀書，讀死書，現在想來，眞覺得貽誤不小啊！</p>

<p>— 一木</p>
<p>老紳士勃然答道：你問我要什麼？哼，我要的多着哩！我要烤火，要棲身的所在；而你的爐子裏，正燒着很大的火，畢畢卜卜地在燒，烘得四壁紅了，除了你，却沒有人來享受。噲，小朋友，快快地讓我進來；我要進來烤一烤火。」</p>
<p>這時格勒正伸長了頭頸，探在窗外，覺得一陣陣的冷氣，刮上臉來，運忙縮了頭，回到窗內，果然見那爐中的火畢畢卜卜地響，火光很美麗，那火舌倒像聞到了羊肉的香味似的，直向着烟囱伸得長長的。格勒心想這樣好的火，却沒有人來烤着取暖，豈不可惜，於是他的心頓時軟化了下來，一面自自言自語道：「他老人家的身上，當眞被雨打得很濕，我還是讓他進來坐一刻吧。」當下就趕到門前，把門開了，那老紳士忙不迭的踱進展子，一陣風跟了進來，吹得烟囱裏火星直冒。</p>
<p>老紳士向格勒說道：「你眞是一個好孩子，快不必擔心着你的兩位哥哥要難為你，等他們回來時，讓我來和他們說明好了。」格勒念道：「先生，請你不必費心，我容留你在這裏，也萬萬等不到他們回來的時候，因為他們見我放了外人進來，一定會打死我的。」老紳士息道：「呀聽了你這種話，我很為難受。但能容留我多少時候啊？」格勒容道：「先生，等我把這塊羊肉燻好，整塊兒變做棕褐色的時候。」</p>
<p>老紳士走進了廚房，在爐旁坐了下來，他那帽子的尖頂，還是碰到了天花板上，格勒仍然坐下來燻着羊肉，把那鐵排不住的翻來翻去，一面向老紳士說道：「先生，你的衣服　會兒就可烘乾的。」但那老紳士並不脫下外衣來烘，兀自讓那外衣上的水，一滴一滴的淌在爐中的炭上，累得那火一晃一晃的，又不住的發出爆聲來。但那水有的　淌在爐中，有的却像溝水般流在地板上，好似變成了條小溪。格勒瞧了這情形，即忙說道：「先生，對不起，可能把你的外衣脫下來交給我嗎？」老紳士答道：「那不必，謝謝你。」格勒又問道：「先生，你的帽子呢？」老紳士又答道：「那也不必，謝謝你。」格勒囁囁嚅嚅地說道：「先生，對不起得很，但你身上的水，快要澆滅我的火了。」老紳士冷然說道：「那麼你的羊肉可以多燻一些時候哩。」</p>
<p>格勒瞧了這老紳士的行爲，又冷淡，又奇怪，心中很爲詫異，當下靜默了一會，他老人家却又說道：「你的羊肉模樣兒很好，可能給我吃一些麼？」格勒急道：「那不能，先生。」老紳士又道：「我委實是餓極了。昨天旣沒有吃東西，今天也沒有吃過什麼。在那肘子的一邊，難道不能割下一些些嗎？」格勒聽那聲音怪悽慘的，他的心頭又軟化了，說道：「先生，我的兩位哥哥，曾允許我今天可以吃一小片，那我就讓給你吃了吧。不過只有這一小片，不能再多哩。」</p>

<p>— 君美</p>
<p>淸康熙時，京師有善口技者，藝尤卓絕，演時不一其事，而狀家庭瑣屑尤神妙。　終某王公席上奏技，始遙遙聞犬吠聲，便有婦人驚覺，欠仲搖其夫，語猥褻事，夫囈語，婦搖之不已，旣而兒醒大啼，夫令婦撫兒乳，兒含乳啼，夫起溺，婦亦抱而起溺，床上有一大兒醒，維時婦手拍兒聲，口中嗚嗚聲，兒含乳啼聲，大兒初醒聲，床帳撩動聲，夫叱聲，便溺聲，一齊湊發，衆妙畢備，滿座賓客，無不仲頸側目，以爲　妙絕。旣而夫上床寢，又呼大兒溺畢，小兒亦漸入睡，婦拍兒亦漸止，鼾聲遂大作，俄聞一人大呼火起，夫聞聲驚起大呼，婦亦起呼，兩兒齊哭，四隣亦大呼，於是千百兒哭，千百犬吠，中間力拉崩倒之聲，火爆聲，呼呼風聲，喊救聲，曳屋邪許聲，搶奪潑水聲，萬態齊作，彷彿祝融正肆虐也。於是賓客無不變色離席，奮袖出臂，兩股戰慄欲先走。忽然撫尺一聲，羣響畢絕，賓客始而驚惶者，撤席視之，則一人·一桌·一椅·一扇·一撫尺而已。無不爲　之啞然失笑，其神妙有如此者。</p>
<p>至以肖聲著稱於志籍者，則如明末之狗皮道士，作犬吠聲酷相類，乞食成都市上，時獻忠方入寇，道士突出獻忠馬前數十步，大作犬吠聲而逸。及元旦，獻忠朝百官，正陞陛禮拜間，道士不知於何時掩入，亦執笏列班中，遽作犬吠聲，獻忠大怒，令縛之，道士乃大作大吠聲，盈庭如千百犬爭吠狀，聲澈四外，合城之犬，聞聲羣起而和，吠聲震天地，獻忠大聲呼衆皆不聞，爲犬吠聲所亂也，於是倉皇退去，道士乃乘間得脫。又有在嘯翁者，善　，能作鸞鶴鳳風聲，每一發聲，則百鳥翔集，鷄鷸俱舞。作老龍吟，則醉臥大江之濱，長吟數聲，魚蝦皆破浪來潮，　龜多迎濤以拜。今日遊藝塲中亦有以口技售藝者，僅能描摹比擬，其神妙去往昔之所謂口技者遠矣。</p>

<p>— 新影</p>
<p>任何人都知道，電影並不是一種純娛樂的工具，除了娛樂之外，更含有敎育的意義，而所具暗示的力量，更比任何敎育工具爲　大。所以一部有關家庭問題的影片，每會影響若干家庭的轉變。一個家庭革命的故事，攝上了銀慕，會使若干不滿家庭壓迫的靑年，對家長格外仇視恨不得出走，同樣一個充滿了甜蜜的家庭的故事，攝上了銀幕，會使若干意見相左的夫婦，因而和好起來。電影的感人之深，也可見一斑了。</p>
<p>最近有一部好萊塢的影片，在上海公映之後，竟使一個上海人獲得了深刻的印象。馬上回到家裏，和他的妻女團聚。重新開始他的新生活。因爲　一年之前，他和另外一個女子姘識了，夫婦之間時常吵鬧，終於出走。這部影片就是在國泰公映的「寒夜琴挑」InterMezzo，是一個戀愛故事，討論家庭問題，描寫一個父親和另外一憫女人發生關係，因而使家庭不和。影片中所映的一切，使那位上海人特別注意，好像把他生活的全部，攝上了銀幕。</p>
<p>他的感情是抑制不住了，他佩服好萊塢編寫電影脚本者的聰明，他是和他的妻女離開了，單獨住在外面。然而出走得兩天，他就到國泰去看「寒夜琴挑」，結果使他在心理上起了劇烈的衝突，終於決定了回到老家去。因爲在這影片的故事裏雖然那位少女和那爸爸發生了戀愛，但她想到爸爸出走之後家裏的妻女一定會受到莫大的痛苦，所以決定犧牲了自己，使他回復到和好如初的兩性生活。</p>

<p>劉趕三二驢送喪</p>
<p>俗謂「物各有主」，畜類之忠於其主，亦如封建時代人臣事君一樣的忠實。丑角前輩劉趕三生前曾畜一驢一靈馴異常，劉每演「探親相駡」，必騎之上臺。此驢受趕三訓練，能解主人言語意旨，當在內庭演劇時，趕三牽驢至臺口，謂之曰「老佛爺聖駕在此，還不跪下磕頭！」此驢即前膝點地，向殿上叩頭不已，西后見之大樂，有時且頒賞賜，後竟按月支給口糧。自昔帝王恩賜大臣以穿朝御馬者雖曾有之，但從未能如此驢之足踐後宮，並時受帝后賞賚者趕三之丑婆堪稱古今無兩，而其彩旦戲之最膾炙人口者，寳以「探親」騎眞驢上台作種種之表演，爲尤能轟動京畿也。據云驢之食料全由趕三爲之躬親餵養，劉出入亦必依之代步，每抵目的地，劉下驢逕入宅內，將驢留置鬥外，旣不必拴於柱上，亦不用人守護，倘有生人擬試跨驢背或欲盜竊以去，則此驢咆哮跳躍，盜者決不能近之，惟一見劉，即又馴良如故。北平前門外廊房一條某老照相館門前，於民國初年時曾懸同光年間著名伶人畫像十餘幅，用筆精細，所繪諸人無不維妙維肖，且設色亦鮮艷勻整，如程長庚，徐小香，盧勝奎，余三勝，梅巧玲，劉趕三，等均在其列，時人號爲十三絕。因此十三人者皆係當時生，旦，凈，丑，各行中負有絕技之人才也。（一七八）</p>

<p>Tongguan:  After the Chinese army in southeastern Jin captured Taiyi Town, they took advantage of their victory to attack Bayi Town on the morning of the 24th.

<p>Luoyang:  The Chinese army in northern Henan has been fighting fiercely for the past ten days, achieving great victories. The night before last, they attacked Bo'ai and engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese. All the outer strongholds were captured. The remaining Japanese troops retreated into the city. The Chinese army is now intensifying its encirclement and fierce attack. Several hundred Japanese soldiers were killed in this battle, and countless military supplies were seized, which are currently being inventoried. (27th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Xi'an:  Wuchekou (west of Wuzhi on the south bank of the Qin River) and Qindi were previously destroyed by the Japanese. The Chinese government allocated large sums of money to provide relief through work, employing disaster-stricken civilians to repair the Qin River embankments of the villages of Beiyuan, Fancun, Xiaogao, and Wanhua Zhuang. Because workers had difficulty traveling back and forth, many stayed overnight in Wucun (Wuzhi County). Unexpectedly, over three hundred Japanese troops from Mulandiandian (east of Wuzhi) surrounded Wucun on the morning of the 14th, burning approximately nine hundred houses. Corpses were piled up inside and outside the village, blood flowed across the ground, and cries shook the sky. It was an unbearable tragedy, and the catastrophe was unprecedented. (26th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Chongqing:  The Nanzheng Yitian Catholic Church was bombed twice in October of last year, and there were claims that it was bombed by Chinese air force. The Central News Agency, considering this fact very strange, made special inquiries to all parties concerned. It was learned that the church was indeed bombed twice on October 25th and October 30th of last year, and that the bombers were indeed Japanese aircraft, not Chinese aircraft. However, Bishop Baji Zhong of the church had already issued a formal statement to the local authorities stating that Chinese aircraft had never bombed the Catholic Church, etc. This shows that the claim that the Chinese army bombed the church is entirely false.

<h3 id="e8">Japanese Rumors Are Not Worth Refuting <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing:  The spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that, according to reports, the Japanese army spokesperson in Shanghai claimed that the Chinese side planned to sink the American warship carrying Ambassador Johnson to China to create a crisis in U.S.-Japan relations. This kind of slander is not worth refuting. However, it is shocking that a spokesperson for a formal military organization would release such irresponsible news, which is sufficient to demonstrate the moral decline of the Japanese military personnel. It is unknown whether the Japanese are spreading such rumors in advance for some other conspiracy, but based on their past actions, such as the injury of former British Ambassador Knatchbull-Hugessen or the bombing of the American gunboat Panay, we can only hope that irresponsible words do not lead to irresponsible actions.

<p>Tianjin:  The Japanese authorities have formally notified the British Consulate that the barbed wire around the concessions will be electrified tomorrow because a large number of Chinese have recently entered the concessions through this route. Recently, strict controls have been implemented at all entry and exit points regarding the import of food into the concessions, resulting in all vendors in the vegetable market having nothing to sell today. Currently, no one, regardless of nationality, is allowed to carry even a small amount of food into the concessions, except for Italians and White Russians, who are treated slightly more leniently. Prices have risen by over fifty percent overnight. The reason for this sudden tightening of restrictions has not been officially explained by any party, and the vendors only say that they are not allowed to transport food into the concessions.

<p>Chongqing:  The Sino-Soviet Cultural Association convened women from all walks of life in Chongqing to hold a tea party to welcome the wife of Soviet Ambassador Pan Youxin and female Soviet friends traveling in China. Over ten people, including the Soviet Ambassador's wife, and over a hundred female representatives from all walks of life attended. The event began with a speech by Fu Xuewen, wife of Shao Lizi, who chaired the meeting, followed by Cao Mengjun reporting on the participation of Chinese women in the War of Resistance and national construction. Then, the Soviet Ambassador's wife gave a speech, and the wives of the TASS director and Liu Qingyang, Tang Guozhen, and others gave speeches. Finally, after refreshments, both Chinese and Soviet men and women sang the national anthems of both countries and famous Chinese and Soviet songs, and the party ended in joy. (27th Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e11">Wang, Wang, and Liang Talks Have Concluded <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>Qingdao:  The meeting held here regarding the establishment of a new "Central Government" of China has concluded. It is expected that Jingwei will fly back to Shanghai today. At the conclusion of the meeting, Wang formally issued a statement saying that the results of the meeting were more satisfactory than the previous meeting held in Nanjing in September. It has now been fully agreed that the Kuomintang will, together with the existing government, other existing political parties, and non-partisan national leaders, organize a conference to eliminate past political disagreements and create a "Central Government." This regime will formulate basic principles, which will be implemented by the "Central Government" to restore peace and establish peaceful relations with Japan and other friendly nations, and to politically and economically revive China. At the time, Wang told foreign journalists yesterday that the Central Political Conference would be the highest authority of his new government and would invite people from the "Provisional Government" in Beiping and the "Reformed Government" in Nanjing to participate. He would appoint others and invite Kuomintang members and leaders of other parties. Initially, it was expected that the conference would be held in Shanghai, but this may now change. After the new government is established, relations with Japan will be discussed. As for the status of North China, the most important thing is that, in any case, the sovereignty of the government will not be harmed. Before the war, there was the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Council. Now, there will still be a political affairs council in Beiping, but it will be managed by the government. The new government will declare that it will generally acknowledge foreign debts with the assistance of the entire China, except for those "illegally" borrowed by the Chongqing government since the outbreak of the war. The new government will study all loans, including those made to the "Provisional" and "Reformed" governments, and "adjust" them. Wang went on to say, "We hope that the Chongqing government will accept our principles. If they do not accept them, then they will lose their legal effect. We have waited for a long time for Chongqing to accept our peace proposals, but we cannot wait any longer, so that the world will believe that we have done something. There is much controversy in Chongqing. We should not expect a small number of people to accept our proposals, but should expect the acceptance of the entire nation." When asked about the differences in the status of the occupied areas after the establishment of the new government, Wang replied, "How can we ask Japan to withdraw its troops if Chongqing continues to resist? The presence of Japanese troops in China is due to Chongqing's stubbornness." Zhu has recently refuted the peace proposals announced in Hong Kong on the 21st of this month by his former party members, and now refutes them again. When asked whether he had signed any documents on the date (December 30) reported in Hong Kong, Wang stated, "I have not signed any documents. Treaties must be signed by two governments, not between individuals." (27th Reuter)</p>
<h3 id="e12">Military Commission Announces Weekly War Situation: January 20 to January 26 <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing: The spokesperson of the Military Commission stated that the war situation this week (January 20 to January 26) was more intense in the northern Hubei area. The Chinese army continued to fight, annihilating over ten thousand Japanese soldiers. Following the disastrous defeat in northern Guangdong, the Japanese suffered another major blow and attempted to cover it up by making trouble in Zhejiang. However, under China's strong resistance, they will definitely not succeed. The more important details of the combat operations are described below.</p>
<p>The Chinese army in southern Hubei has been patrolling Yangxin, Xintanpu, Tongcheng, and other places for days, gaining significant victories and thoroughly destroying railways and highways. Japanese communication has been cut off, and the important strongholds of Nanlinqiao West and Heishixia have been recaptured. The Japanese troops trapped in Tongcheng are still surrounded by the Chinese army and are extremely panicked. In central Hubei, the key areas of Shangyangzi, Niejiadian, and Xihushan were recaptured, and Zhongxiang is currently being attacked in the snow. The Japanese in Yangzi are stubbornly resisting, and fierce fighting is underway. In northern Hubei, over 20,000 Japanese soldiers with over 40 artillery pieces, over 40 tanks, and multiple aircraft have been harassing the Gao Cheng area near Suixian for days. The Chinese army, with the greatest determination and careful deployment, lured the Japanese into the Chinese encirclement and attacked from all sides, cutting off the Japanese rear. Starting on the 20th, various routes launched fierce attacks. The Japanese also used artillery and tanks to maneuver with the Chinese forces. Fortunately, there was heavy snowfall. Chinese soldiers advanced bravely and captured the strongholds of Hong Chong, Tumen Chong, Shimen, Yinjia Dian, and Gao Cheng, killing over 4,000 Japanese soldiers, wounding 7,000 to 8,000, and capturing countless weapons, ammunition, mules, horses, and supplies. On the morning of the 21st, the Japanese fled in panic and retreated south. The Chinese army pursued them in the snow. By the morning of the 23rd, they recaptured the areas of Houziwan, Yuanjiawan, Xujiawan, Wanjia Dian, and Taerwan. The remaining Japanese troops in these areas were collapsing and retreating, still trapped in heavy encirclement. The Chinese armies continued to advance, fiercely attacking, and killed over 3,500 Japanese soldiers by 11:00 PM. In total, over 15,000 Japanese soldiers were annihilated in this campaign, 6 heavy artillery pieces, over 20 field artillery pieces, and over 4,000 machine guns and rifles were seized, and over 20 Japanese tanks and over 50 vehicles were destroyed, creating the Second Great Victory in Northern Hubei. The remaining Japanese soldiers have completely lost their will to fight and are breaking out in different directions. Some are heading to Suixian and Zhehe, and some are collapsing and retreating to Yujia Dian. The Chinese forces are still in close pursuit. The Tsuchibashi Division of the Japanese army in Hangxian has been active this week. On the night of the 21st, they launched several attacks on the south bank with multiple speedboats but were repelled. At dawn on the 22nd, the Japanese again landed forcefully in the 600 mu and Jiujiayi areas northeast of Xiaoshan, under the cover of aircraft, and advanced toward Xiaoshan. Chinese local units resisted step by step, and the fighting was very fierce. One Japanese force once broke through to the vicinity of Linpu Town but was fiercely intercepted by the Chinese forces. After fierce fighting until the evening of the 24th, over 700 were killed or wounded, and the remaining Japanese soldiers collapsed and retreated. The Chinese army took advantage of the victory to recapture Yiqiao Town and Wenjia Yan. The remaining Japanese soldiers retreated to Xiaoshan, and the Chinese army is now attacking fiercely. Another Japanese force advanced from Huangshan Town to Qianqing, attempting to threaten Shaoxing. They were met with a head-on attack from the Chinese army, and many were killed or wounded. The Japanese repeatedly sent reinforcements to attack, but were repelled. Currently, there are no traces of Japanese soldiers near Qianqing. Also, the Japanese forces in Jiaxing, Puyuan, and Wuzhen advanced on multiple routes to Sutou but were intercepted by the Chinese forces, resulting in many deaths and injuries. The Japanese in Fuyang also repeatedly attacked Fenghuang Mountain on the 20th. The Chinese army charged into the snow, and the Japanese abandoned countless corpses.</p>
<p>The Changzhi-Huanan Pass forces, after recapturing Xihuo Town, gained momentum and continued to attack Yincheng and Bayi Towns, and the fighting was extremely fierce. The remaining Japanese soldiers in the small towns of Zhoucun and Chiling (south of Huguan) have been successively cleared. The Chinese army in the northern section of the Bai-Jin Road has also been very active recently. The newly built railway by the Japanese between Nanguan Town and Fenshiling was thoroughly destroyed by the Chinese forces. All the over 10,000 Japanese troops who invaded from the Changzi, Changzhi, and Huguan areas have been completely defeated. Over 5,000 have been annihilated by the Chinese army, and a large number have been captured. The victory is still being expanded. The Chinese army in southern Jin has been fiercely attacking Fushan, Yicheng, and Si County for days and sent a division in an outflanking maneuver, gradually surrounding the Japanese troops north and south of Dajiao Town southeast of Quwo and in the Jiang County area. The Japanese support route has been cut off, and their formation is in disarray. Ershiling has been fiercely attacked by the Chinese army for days, and Japanese reinforcements are not coming. Annihilation is imminent. The Japanese troops in the Zhaocun and Liuzhuang areas have also been defeated by the Chinese forces, and all these areas have been recovered.</p>
<p>The Chinese army in northern Guangdong has continued to advance south this week. One unit is mopping up the remaining Japanese soldiers in the Guotang area, and there are currently no traces of Japanese soldiers in Xin Street. Another unit has attacked Taipingchang and Shengang, seizing a large amount of loot. On the 20th, the Chinese army attacking Zengcheng once broke into the city and killed many Japanese soldiers. They are currently still in a standoff with the Japanese in the suburbs of the city. As for the area near the Yongqin Road in southern Guangxi, the Chinese and Japanese forces have repeatedly engaged in fierce fighting. The Japanese troops in Xiaodong, with over 2,000 infantry, cavalry, and artillery, attacked Zhennanxu and fought fiercely near Sihe Ao for three days and nights, annihilating over half of the Japanese forces. The Japanese battalion commander Major Hyakuki, company commanders Captain Motoki Ichiro and Captains Maemura and Kigi were all captured. The remaining Japanese soldiers collapsed. Another unit of the Chinese army took advantage of the situation to successively recapture the strongholds of Tangbao, Guzhen, Namengkou, Songwuling, Niuluan, Jiulong, Baicheng, and Qingtang, annihilating a large number of Japanese soldiers.</p>
<p>In addition, the Sui army heavily damaged the Japanese troops who were active in Baotou and fiercely attacked Sato and both counties. The Hebei army broke into Zaoqiang, recovering Yuanshi Shuyincun, Zanhuang Guocun, and Nanxing and other places, killing over 500 Japanese soldiers. The Shandong army captured the outer perimeters of Gaomi, Shuangyangdian, and Jingzhi Town, two strongholds, killing over 700 Japanese soldiers, and the siege of Zhanwen is still underway by Chinese forces and the Japanese have been surrounded. Many Japanese soldiers have been annihilated by the Chinese. The recovery of Lifeng Station in northern Henan, Luo Wang and Lizhuang in eastern Henan, and the break into Shangqiu and Luyi are all important achievements of the past week. (27th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Japan's recent diplomatic offensive has clearly hit a wall due to the United States' firm refusal to renew the commercial treaty. The political offensive, with the so-called compromise documents revealed by Gao Tao Jiebu, is tantamount to launching a torpedo. At the same time, there is a military offensive in eastern Zhejiang, which only reveals that it is the end of a powerful arrow. At 6:00 PM on the 21st of this month, the Japanese army in Hangzhou, under the cover of heavy artillery fire amidst heavy snowfall, crossed the river from Nanxing Bridge and landed in the 600 mu area on the Xiaoshan riverbank. After landing, they divided into southeast routes. The southern route was along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi railway line, intending to capture Linpu and Fengqiao, intrude into Zhuji and Jinhua, and occupy the heartland of Zhejiang's resistance. The eastern route planned to use Qianqing Town as a stronghold, first seize Shaoxing, then attack Ningbo; on the one hand, to contain the Chinese army's flanking attacks and consolidate its southern assault on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi railway line; on the other hand, to cut off the passage between the Zhejiang coast (especially Ningbo) and the interior. At the same time, an offensive was launched along the Fu River line from Fuyang, intending to intrude into Xindeng and Tonglu, and coordinate with the troops on the south bank of the Qian River. If the situation permits, the ultimate goal would be to join forces in Jinhua. In addition, there is a passive effect, which is to ease the Chinese army's offensive against the Taihu Lake area. Along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road, such as Xincun southwest of Jiaxing, new Chinese forces have recently joined the battle, inflicting heavy losses on the Japanese army repeatedly. The Japanese army's offensive on the south bank of the Qian River has its own significance in containing the Chinese army on the north bank of the Qian River.</p>
<p>Since the occupation of each strategic point on the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines, the center of gravity of the entire war has long since shifted westward. The war in eastern Zhejiang is like "a battle on a snail's horn," irrelevant to the overall victory or defeat. Even as the Japanese side has stated recently, the purpose of intruding into eastern Zhejiang is not to occupy the location, but to strike at the Chinese guerrillas and ensure the security of the area near Shanghai and Hangzhou. Such a public explanation of its strategy certainly has other intentions, but it can also prove that the war in eastern Zhejiang does not have much value in the entire war. However, because eastern Zhejiang is close to Shanghai and the economic connections are relatively close, and about one million Shanghai residents are from eastern Zhejiang, once an emergency alert is issued from the half of eastern Zhejiang that has been spared from devastation since the "July 7th" Incident, it is particularly noticed by Shanghai.</p>
<p>One week has passed since the Japanese army crossed the river. Initially, due to transportation obstruction and confusion, rumors were rampant and people were panicked. Now, the truth is gradually becoming clear, which is sufficient to prove that the military situation in that area will not deteriorate to any extent for the time being. Although there are many rumors, they are not credible. Reliable news will not arrive in Shanghai for some time. Of course, we do not want to be deliberately optimistic. On the contrary, we admit that, in addition to the overall war situation, the suffering of eastern Zhejiang has its own considerable seriousness. If the Japanese army does not hesitate to make heavy sacrifices and disregards gains and losses, then it is not absolutely impossible to seize eastern Zhejiang.</p>
<p>Looking at the war situation after the Japanese army crossed the river, we feel that although the Japanese army is carrying out a planned operation this time, it does not have the determination to disregard heavy sacrifices. After all, the gains and losses in eastern Zhejiang are irrelevant to the overall situation! And after Shanghai and Hangzhou fell, the Qian River was forbidden to cross, and the coast was blockaded, the role of the ports in eastern Zhejiang has been greatly restricted. Therefore, the significance of destroying the traffic between the Zhejiang coast and the interior is reduced accordingly. Then, whether it is worth fighting for eastern Zhejiang at a heavy price is highly questionable. Of course, if the Japanese army can capture Ning and Shao without shedding blood, and then take Jinhua in one fell swoop, and plunder the essence of eastern Zhejiang, or use war to support the war, it would not be without benefit. At the same time, it would be good to occupy the heartland of Zhejiang's resistance. Unfortunately, in fact, it is not so easy. Because at present, going deep into eastern Zhejiang is absolutely unfavorable to the Japanese army in terms of weather, geography, and people. Although eastern Zhejiang is not the northern frontier, it is winter and the weather is cold and bitter. Moreover, the rivers and canals are crisscrossed, the fields are intertwined, the wind and snow are heavy, and the roads are muddy, making it difficult to march. The area west of Xiaoshan, Zhuji and Fengqiao, is even more mountainous, and at the key locations within the jurisdiction of Ning and Shao, as well as the upper reaches of the Fuyang River, the Chinese army had already built strong fortifications two years ago! It is difficult to fly over them. What is easier to grab is still limited to the coastal waters within the range of naval activities. If they leave the naval range, then the Japanese army will once again be in danger of going deep into enemy territory, and the Chinese army's elite troops can be assembled with a single call. For example, in recent days, the Hunan army, which has opened up north along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Road, has exceeded 50,000, together with the local anti-Japanese self-defense groups and the provincial defense groups, which are enough to inflict heavy blows on the Japanese army. The military and civilian officials in this theater are even more temporary choices of being able to fight well, loyal and dedicated. With high morale and harmony between the military and civilians, the Japanese army will not be allowed to take advantage easily. With all these factors, the Japanese army will begin to shrink back. If they venture deep, they must make heavy sacrifices. According to yesterday's war news, the Japanese army, starting from Xiaoshan, attacked the southeast routes and was repelled by the Chinese army, greatly reducing its vigor. The Japanese army that peeped at Xindeng from Fuyang has also been completely dispersed, and the Chinese army has taken advantage of the victory to cross the Fenghuang Mountain and advance to Fuyang. This shows that the tense war situation in eastern Zhejiang has taken a turn for the better. The Japanese military's so-called "having stopped the pursuit" is nothing but a pretext. But the "stopping" of the Japanese army in eastern Zhejiang must be close to the truth!</p>
<h3 id="e15">After the Abolition of the U.S.-Japan Commercial Treaty: U.S. Imposes Economic Sanctions on Japan, Securing Freedom of Action, Plans Various Measures to Implement at Any Time, Will Not Cease Until Japan Complies <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>Washington – Now that the U.S.-Japan Commercial Treaty has expired, the call for authorizing the State Department to selectively restrict or prohibit trade with Japan is gaining strength in some quarters. Democratic Senator Hatch stated last night that he believes such a move is feasible, and an unnamed member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee also supported this proposal, saying that it would give the State Department a powerful tool to utilize at any time as U.S.-Japan relations evolve. While Tokyo considers the demise of the U.S.-Japan Commercial Treaty to have occurred at 10:00 a.m. on Thursday (Eastern Standard Time), Washington officials calculate it to be midnight (Eastern Standard Time). There were no ceremonies, official announcements, or government directives to mark the occasion. President Roosevelt declined to discuss the matter when meeting with reporters, and Secretary of State Hull was resting at home due to a cold and did not receive visitors. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<p>Washington – The expiration of the U.S.-Japan Commercial Treaty has ushered the U.S.-Japan dispute over the "New Order in East Asia" into a new stage. The U.S. termination of this treaty is a clear challenge to Japan's "New Order" because it allows the U.S. government to impose economic sanctions on Japan if it deems it appropriate. Currently, there are several economic sanction proposals in the Senate awaiting Congressional discussion. Furthermore, the government also has the power to impose economic penalties on Japan and any other country. From the American perspective, Japan's "New Order in East Asia" is nothing more than a euphemism for dominating East Asia and closing the door to China. Therefore, the U.S. will not cease applying economic pressure on Japan until Japan abandons its current policies. However, the steps taken may be gradual. The methods by which the U.S. will pressure Japan in the future include: (1) Imposing an embargo on military raw materials to Japan; (2) Utilizing existing laws to increase tonnage taxes and barge fees on Japanese ships; (3) Imposing punitive tariffs on Japanese goods; (4) The government utilizing its authority to urge Congress to pass broader economic sanction measures. (Associated Press, 27th)</p>
<p>Washington – The 1911 U.S.-Japan Commercial Treaty expired at midnight yesterday. Many Senators reiterated their demands yesterday, urging the U.S. to "end the Sino-Japanese War" and impose a ban on the export of military raw materials to Japan. However, the State Department remained deliberately silent regarding the treaty's expiration. The statement issued by Democratic Congressman Bloom was closest to the administration's position. According to Bloom, the treaty's termination "merely prevents Japan from making any further excuses or gestures." The Senate's sentiment on the embargo issue has not yet solidified. Some proponents of the embargo predict that the Senate will take definitive action soon. According to an Associated Press reporter's survey, most Senators currently oppose taking drastic measures, "advocating letting things develop naturally to avoid provoking any action by Japan." They also expressed doubt whether the Senate Foreign Relations Committee will pass an embargo bill. Democratic Senator Warren White, the most optimistic proponent of imposing an embargo on Japan, stated that the Senate will consider his proposal, as well as the proposal of Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Pittman. He also said, "The expiration of the U.S.-Japan Commercial Treaty provides us with a great opportunity to fulfill the expectations of 75 percent of our people and stay out of the Sino-Japanese War vortex." Senators George and King stated that they believe the Senate will take action on the embargo proposal. George also believes that Congress will at least ban the export of strategic raw materials to Japan. However, other Senators believe that the U.S. government will take a wait-and-see approach, observing Japan's reaction after the U.S.-Japan Commercial Treaty's termination before deciding on countermeasures. This observation seems to align with the State Department's attitude towards Japan. (Associated Press, 27th)</p>
<h3 id="e16">Ambassador Hu Shih Reveals President Roosevelt's Inquiry into Continued Financial Aid; Roosevelt Consistently Expressed Sympathy Towards China; Dr. Yen Hui-ching to Depart the U.S. and Return Home <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>Washington – Chinese Ambassador to the U.S., Dr. Hu Shih, inquired with President Roosevelt yesterday about whether the U.S. could continue to provide financial assistance to China, now that the U.S.-Japan Commercial Treaty has expired and the U.S. is free to apply economic pressure on Japan. Ambassador Hu, accompanied by economic advisor Dr. Yen Hui-ching, met with President Roosevelt for half an hour. Ambassador Hu stated that because President Roosevelt had expressed sympathy towards China, the National Government intended to request a supplement to the $25 million USD previously lent to China by the U.S. Export-Import Bank, as much of that fund had already been used. This request will be submitted once the U.S. Congress's discussion of aid to Finland has eased somewhat. He also stated that the current loan, used to purchase trucks, fuel, and other supplies needed by the Chinese army, will be exhausted by the end of this month. According to this loan, China used tung oil and other export products as collateral, which has now been repaid, so China's borrowing power can be greatly increased. At the same time, according to officials here, the U.S. government fears that urging Congress to pass Pittman's bill banning the export of war materials to Japan will provoke a heated debate, and that staunchly advocating for the bill's passage might incite American peace organizations to advocate for applying neutrality laws fairly to both China and Japan, which would be detrimental to China. Therefore, to avoid taking this risk, it is generally believed that Secretary of State Hull will not take a definitive stance when presenting his views on the Pittman bill to the influential Senate Foreign Relations Committee in the coming days. Officials indicate that the State Department currently believes that the Pittman bill's weapon will be used at a later date and that now is not the time. (International News Service, 27th)</p>
<p>Washington – Chinese Ambassador Hu Shih stated yesterday after visiting President Roosevelt with Dr. Yen Hui-ching that China hopes the U.S. can continue to provide loans to China, as the $25 million USD previously lent to China by the U.S. will be exhausted by the end of January. He also said that Mr. Chen Guangfu, who has been here for a month, is handling this matter. As for Dr. Yen Hui-ching's visit to Roosevelt, it was to bid farewell to the American President, as Dr. Yen will soon take a train to the West Coast and then board a ship to Manila to return home.

<p>Tokyo – After the abolition of the U.S.-Japan Commercial Treaty, people here unanimously expressed indignation. Japanese businessmen are apprehensive about the American approach of maintaining trade relations "day by day." The government, on the other hand, sees the American government's actions as having ulterior motives and expresses indignation. At the same time, Japanese newspapers are uniformly employing intimidation tactics, hoping that Japan and the U.S. will sign a new treaty. It is generally believed that if the current situation persists, U.S.-Japan trade relations will inevitably deteriorate further. Japanese officials expressed regret that the American side failed to sign a transitional commercial treaty with the Japanese government. They stated that the significance of the abolition of the U.S.-Japan Commercial Treaty is not limited to protecting American interests in China; in reality, it is an attempt to destroy Japan's "New Order in East Asia" plan. It is generally believed that after the abolition of the U.S.-Japan Commercial Treaty, the American side will inevitably implement sanctions. If such measures are put into effect, the Japanese side will inevitably take retaliatory action. In short, Japan will never abandon its continental policy due to American pressure. In this regard, the meeting held by Wang Jingwei and others in Qingdao this week is clear evidence. Although Japan is well aware that the U.S. will not recognize it, Wang Jingwei's "new government" will still be established. (Associated Press, 27th)</p>

<p>Washington – Renowned American Howard newspaper author Denny stated yesterday, "Britain's failure to abolish the Anglo-Japanese Commercial Treaty this time proves that Britain is not cooperating with the U.S. In view of the assistance that the U.S. is currently providing to Britain, this situation seems inappropriate. However, the fact is that the British Navy does have the possibility of not cooperating with the U.S. regarding the U.S.-Japan dispute. The American public is very angry about this, but the government is very calm. They believe that the British government will not continue this short-sighted policy." (United Press, 27th)</p>
<p>Tokyo – The Japanese Restoration Youth Corps went to the Japanese Foreign Ministry today to request the recall of the Japanese Ambassador to Britain and the occupation of British concessions in China, as well as Japanese assistance to India in achieving independence, to retaliate for the British warship's interception of the Japanese mail ship "Asama Maru" last week.

<p>Hong Kong – Tokyo dispatch: The Osaka "Jiji Shinbun" and other important local newspapers convened a large-scale anti-British rally in Osaka today, attended by 1,000 representatives from various groups and tens of thousands of citizens. They protested against the "Asama Maru" incident and the statement made by British Ambassador Craigie. Mr. So-and-so, a professor at Shanxi Imperial University, the chairman of the Osaka Chamber of Commerce, and 30 others delivered speeches in succession. The rally immediately passed a resolution, believing that Britain's insult to the Japanese Empire should be met with resolute action, and decided to send telegrams to Prime Minister Yonai, Foreign Minister Arita, and British Ambassador Craigie, stating the rally's position. Anti-British rallies are also being convened in Kyoto, Kobe, and other western cities. (Telegram, 27th)</p>

<p>Manchester – The First Lord of the Admiralty, Winston Churchill, delivered a speech this afternoon at the "Free Trade" [Hall] here, stating in essence that the British Empire is united and fully capable of dealing with all events. He expressed his deep conviction that the Allied nations of Britain and France will achieve victory, stating, "Thus far, our navy has accomplished much and can be said to be worthy of the nation, but in order to maintain naval control, we must pay a very high price in terms of lives." Germany's current shipbuilding capacity is not as high as we estimated. The country's use of naval mines is indeed a serious threat, but our country is rich in scientific resources, far above the enemy, and will naturally be able to deal with it. He then touched on the food rationing system, saying that it was a necessary measure to save on transportation. "It can enable the entire nation of the British Empire and the entire lifeblood and energy of the Allied nations to be used to meet the current responsibilities to the last ounce and the last inch. All nationals can serve the country in some way, and increasing food production is one aspect." He hoped that the people would practice thrift to avoid increasing the level of living. Regarding the air force, many people have asked why the German air force has not yet attacked Britain. I am also one of those who wonder. It can be asserted that the German air force either does not attack because of humanitarian considerations, or because of something else. In addition, some people believe that Britain should launch a preemptive strike and attack Germany. I dare not agree with this statement. In fact, our policy of assistance has proven to be correct. The fact that we had several months to replenish our preparations before the outbreak of the war was nothing short of a divine gift. After this, no matter what events occur, as long as we take proper precautions and do not slacken, everything will be fine. Hitler can be said to have lost the best opportunity. In short, Britain does not intend to wait forever for the enemy to attack. It is hoped that Hitler will one day be in a position of waiting and be uneasy because he does not know when we will attack." At this time, the government's top priority in warfare is to win. The government will not feel resentful about any well-intentioned criticism aimed at victory. This is completely opposite to the oppressive methods used by the National Socialist Party. Our Chancellor of the Exchequer, Simon, is now building a real Maginot Line to strengthen financial strength and public confidence. Today's National Socialist Germany is not as strong as yesterday's German Empire, and today's Britain and France have proven to be far stronger than National Socialist Germany. Therefore, the future is very promising. We must now all do our part, whether it is joining the army, controlling the skies, manufacturing munitions, creating the death knell for German submarines, clearing the mines laid by the enemy, cultivating farmland, building ships, defending the streets, rescuing wounded soldiers and civilians, or encouraging the cowardly and respecting the brave. In short, we should strive to move forward in the British Isles and throughout the British Empire. Time waits for no one. Do not waste a week, a day, or an hour. (Havas, 27th)</p>

<p>Paris – According to reliable sources, it is generally believed that one of the results of the Balkan conference to be held in Belgrade on February 2 will be the consolidation of the position of the Balkan countries to cope with the current world situation. It is the general opinion that the improvement of relations between Romania and its smaller neighbors will make a great contribution to the security of southeastern Europe. French figures are carefully watching the Romanian oil situation, believing that there is no reason for panic at present, as the previous negotiations regarding Romanian oil were conducted in the spirit of not harming Romania's freedom of action or policy independence as a neutral country. It will not be possible to determine whether Romania is not strictly adhering to neutrality until a new situation arises. (Reuters, 27th)</p>

<p>London. Japanese envoys from several European countries are currently holding a meeting in the capital of Hungary. The Times correspondent in the city reports that, according to private sources, the main issue being discussed at the meeting is the impact on Japanese foreign policy when Germany and the Soviet Union threaten the countries of the Balkan Peninsula. Generally, Germany has recently made many efforts to bring Japan and the Soviet Union closer together, intending to exchange German-made industrial machinery for Japanese raw materials, especially soybeans, and to use the Siberian Railway as a transportation route. It is said that the Japanese side is not very receptive to this kind of wooing and would rather temporarily put aside its relations with European countries to concentrate its efforts on expanding its influence in the Far East. However, if Germany and the Soviet Union do not engage in the invasion of Southeast Europe, so that the attention of the Western European democracies is not diverted, then Japan's policy of focusing all its efforts on the Far East may be imprudent. The purpose of the Japanese envoys' meeting in Budapest is to assess this situation and extricate Japan from this predicament. (Havas Telegraph, 27th)</p>

<p>Bucharest. The chief representative of the German economic delegation, Dr. Clodius, an economic expert from the German Foreign Ministry, arrived here a few days ago. After reopening negotiations with the Romanian authorities, he has already left for Rome. Well-informed sources here recently said that this does not mean that the economic negotiations between Germany and Romania have been interrupted. Clodius took the opportunity to travel to Rome because he was unable to meet with the relevant Romanian cabinet members. He will return here next week to continue the talks. The issues discussed between Germany and Romania include the following four points: 1. The issue of accelerating the transportation of Romanian oil to Germany by rail. 2. The issue of Germany selling military supplies to Romania. 3. The issue of the quantities of Romanian timber imported into Germany. 4. The issue of setting the exchange rate between the Mark and the Romanian currency. Regarding each point, according to the agreement signed by Germany and Romania on the 21st of this month, Romania has agreed to sell 150,000 tons of oil to Germany each month, but since the beginning of November, railway transportation (via Hungary and the Soviet-occupied areas of eastern Galicia in Poland) has not been smooth. Less than half of the 150,000 tons of oil has been transported to Germany. Germany is eager to find ways to improve this and has suggested to Romania that the railway stations at Teresnyikolti and Bayer of Krestur on the Romanian border in Hungary should be renovated and expanded to facilitate freight transport. Regarding the second point, Germany has suggested that it is willing to lend funds to Romania for the purchase of German military supplies. Regarding the third point, Germany is willing to invest in the Romanian timber industry to accelerate the development of Romanian forests. Regarding the fourth point, Germany intends to raise the exchange rate of the Mark, but this has not yet been resolved. (Havas Telegraph, 27th)</p>
<p>Budapest. According to local newspapers, the Romanian government has now dispatched a division of the army to guard the oil fields. Sources believe that this move is a precautionary measure to prevent strikes. (Haitong Telegraph, 27th)</p>
<p>Paris. Well-informed sources today issued a warning not to exaggerate the German military threat to Romania, lest it fall into the trap of Germany's cunning plan, which is to mobilize troops on the one hand, exaggerate the number of troops mobilized, and on the other hand, take diplomatic action to advance simultaneously with military pressure. Estimates of the number of German troops near the Romanian border vary widely, from 500 to 25 divisions. Well-informed sources believe that the actual number of German troops in the area is between 1,000 and one division. There is no doubt that German troops now control the railway through Lviv in Soviet-occupied Poland, and a large number of German officers in Galicia are monitoring the activities of Germans in the area.

<p>Helsinki. For five consecutive days, Soviet troops northeast of Lake Ladoga have been exerting unrelenting pressure on Finland in an attempt to circumvent Menner and attack the flanks. The attack continued fiercely yesterday, but it is generally believed that this effort by the Soviet side is gradually showing signs of exhaustion. Finnish troops have fought to the death to resist the enemy in the past five days, holding their positions. The Soviet army has dispatched well-equipped fresh troops to the area to help in the battle, as the Soviet General Staff believes that the area is strategically important. Although the Soviet army has been unable to break through the Finnish line of defense, this major offensive seems at least to have extricated the Soviet troops who were lured into a desperate situation by the Finnish army earlier this month, as there was a saying that a Soviet division would be annihilated there. Yesterday, the Soviet army attacked at various points, but according to the Finnish communiqué, the Soviet troops were all repulsed, and the Finnish troops still held all positions. The Soviet side suffered heavy losses. Several Soviet units have been cut off, with hundreds of bodies left on the battlefield and 4,000 war horses lost. On the morning of January 25, Soviet troops launched attacks across the ice at Molagav and Teibel, but were all defeated by Finnish troops. (Reuters, 27th)</p>

At the same time, seven other Red Army officers and soldiers have also been awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union, the Gold Star, and the Order of Lenin. In addition, 891 Red Army officers have also received various medals for their effective service in Finland. (TASS, 27th)</p>
<p>Helsinki. The General Headquarters has issued a war report stating: In the Karelian Isthmus, the Red Army has repeatedly attacked our positions along the Taipale River, but has been repulsed. Several Red Army units have also attacked across the frozen surface of Lake Muolaanjärvi, but have also been repulsed. North of Lake Ladoga, the Red Army has continued to attack, but has not succeeded after five days. Our army is still able to hold its original positions. The Red Army has suffered heavy losses, and several battalions have been wiped out, with thousands of bodies left behind. (Havas Telegraph, 26th)</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden. The Swedish newspaper, the Swedish Times, recently published a telegram from a correspondent stationed in Finland near Lake Ladoga, stating that in the past five days, several divisions of the Red Army have launched attacks on several important Finnish strongholds in an attempt to break through them. Although the offensive was extremely fierce, the results were still unsuccessful, with as many as 5,000 casualties. This is all due to the Red Army's lack of supplies and ammunition. In addition, the Lake Ladoga area is extremely rugged, and the Finnish army is familiar with the terrain, making counterattacks extremely convenient. This is another reason why the Red Army has found it difficult to succeed. (Havas Telegraph, 27th)</p>

<p>London. Swedish Foreign Minister Fider yesterday made a statement to a correspondent from the Daily Telegraph stationed in Stockholm, explaining that Sweden and Finland are closely related. He said, "The people of Sweden unanimously believe that we must do everything we can to help Finland. The interests of that country are our interests, and our future depends on the fate of that country. This sincerity is not to be concealed. No country in the world does not sympathize with Finland, and many countries have even provided material assistance. The continuous flow of this assistance shows that the restoration of international cooperation, which has long been desired by the nations of the world, is likely to be realized in the future." As for the cooperative relationship between the Nordic countries, Sweden has been constantly working to strengthen it in the past few years. The countries of the Scandinavian Peninsula, based on historical lessons, must carry out mutual assistance in diplomatic, economic, and other aspects. Therefore, they have always maintained friendship and solidarity with each other. The various events of recent years have further strengthened the ties between our Nordic countries. In a word, our attitude and efforts to maintain neutrality and defend independence are completely consistent. But one point must be noted, that is, our cooperative relationship has no military significance. As for the future, what we are most concerned with is maintaining trade between the neutral countries of Northern Europe in order to overcome the difficulties we encounter in the international situation. That is all." (Havas Telegraph, 27th)</p>

In the policy of tightening currency, it is stipulated to prohibit all black market exchange rate transactions, and to vigorously promote the savings movement. Also, the Japanese government is now considering implementing a licensed shopping system for daily necessities. This is the first time the Japanese government has considered this system in the two and a half years since the start of the Sino-Japanese hostilities. The first targets considered for the implementation of this system are rice and coal. Some people in Japan advocate that other necessities such as wheat, charcoal, and soy sauce should also be subject to this system. However, the Japanese government does not intend to implement this system for the above-mentioned goods until detailed preparations are completed.

<p>Tokyo. The shortage of coal in Japan has led to an insufficient supply of electricity. This situation has been lingering for more than a day. The cabinet held three consecutive meetings on the 22nd and 23rd of this month. As a result of the discussion, it has been decided to allow the import of foreign coal as an emergency remedy. At the same time, after a long period of consultation between officials from the Ministry of Commerce and Industry and representatives of various coal mines, especially representatives of the two major companies, Mitsui and Mitsubishi, the representatives have agreed to step up supplies to the power plants. The Ministry of Commerce and Industry has also decided not to take stringent measures for the time being. Regarding this matter, Minister of Commerce and Industry Ginjiro Fujiwara told the press yesterday, "I have spent my life bowing and begging people, this is the first time, but I am gratified that as a result of the pleading, the representatives of the coal mines have agreed to unconditionally assist the government." According to well-informed sources here, in the future, the merchants will supply 160,000 tons of coal stockpiled throughout the country to the power plants. At the same time, the government will order 100,000 tons from Taiwan, Sakhalin, and various places in "Manchukuo" for use in January and February. From March, when the two seasons arrive, the power plants can use more hydropower, and the coal shortage situation can be changed. As for the import of foreign coal, a special permit will be issued by the province, and the government has no choice but to provide this convenience in order to relieve the coal shortage. In addition, according to the Kokumin Shimbun, the Tokyo police authorities have notified factories with high electricity consumption to go to the Metropolitan Police Department on the 28th of this month to discuss the plan for one or two days of shutdown per week. Once the agreement is reached, ordinary factories will stop working for one or two days a week to save coal consumption. Also, according to Masaki Matsuda, president of the Japan Electric Power Company, in an interview with the Asahi Shimbun, the government had previously set a method for electricity use in various places, but most users in various places did not comply with it, so it was necessary to adopt a method of stopping work for one or two days a week to make up for it. As of the middle of this month, there have been many cases of factories in various places shutting down due to lack of electricity. Once the government takes the above-mentioned relief measures, the electricity panic problem can be satisfactorily resolved. (Havas Telegraph, 26th)</p>

<p>Chongqing. The Ministry of Finance announced that in the first eight months of the twenty-eighth year, the number of goods exported from "Free China" to the United States exceeded the total for the entire twenty-seventh year. This increase is of particular and significant importance, because for most of the twenty-eighth year, China's overseas trade has been conducted by land routes as a result of Japan's blockade and occupation of various seaports. The announcement also solemnly stated that the figures for the twenty-eighth year do not include goods exported from "Free China" to Hong Kong and Haiphong, most of which are also transported to Canada. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<p>Chongqing. The Foreign Trade Commission of the National Government announced today that in the first eight months of 1939, China's exports to the United States increased by 12,000,000 yuan compared with the entire year of 1938. In the first eight months of last year, "Free China" imported goods from the United States worth Yang 99,499,400 yuan, while in the entire year of 1938, goods worth only 86,852,803 yuan were imported from the United States. The increase in China's exports last year is of great significance, because the goods exported from China in 1939 were transported from the interior to foreign countries through great hardships due to the Japanese army's occupation and blockade of the Chinese coast. The number of exports does not include the large number of goods imported into Hong Kong and Haiphong, a large part of which were re-imported into the United States. Before the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, all goods shipped from China to the United States were exported from the coast. Last year was the most difficult year in China's war commercial history, because China lost the southern section of the vital Canton-Hankou Railway. In order to maintain the balance of foreign trade, the Chinese government is working hard to develop new international routes to increase foreign exports. (United Press, 26th)</p>

<h3 id="e54">Japanese Warship Detains British Vessel: British Authorities Plan to Protest; Captain of the Yongsheng Reports the Incident, the Third Time the Ship Has Been Intercepted <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>The North-China Daily News reports that only two days after the Japanese mail ship Asama Maru was boarded by the British Navy and 21 Germans were taken away, the British Jardine Matheson's Yongsheng was detained by a Japanese warship for 15 hours before being released. The Yongsheng arrived in Shanghai yesterday (26th) from Hong Kong, and Captain Baden immediately reported to the company, the British Navy, and the consulate.</p>
<p>Japanese Warship Fires Two Shots</p>
<p>According to Baden, at 5:36 PM on the 23rd of this month, the Yongsheng, carrying 634 passengers and crew, was sailing off the coast of Matsu Island, Fujian, when it encountered a Japanese mine-laying destroyer. The Japanese ship signaled, and the Yongsheng immediately stopped. At 5:52 PM, the Japanese warship fired a shot, the shell passing over the bow of the Yongsheng. Two minutes later, another shot was fired. The Yongsheng dropped anchor at 6:08 PM. Whether the shots fired by the Japanese warship were blanks is unknown, but an investigation is underway to determine this.</p>
<p>Officers Board to Conduct Search</p>
<p>The Yongsheng then, following the orders of the Japanese warship, sailed closer to the warship and dropped anchor again at 6:53 PM. At 7:05 PM, a Japanese officer, accompanied by a Korean or Taiwanese interpreter who spoke Chinese, and 21 armed sailors boarded the Yongsheng. Baden ordered the crew to show the Japanese officer the Yongsheng's registration certificate, and then was questioned. The Japanese officer wanted to conduct a search. Although Baden objected, he could not prevent it. The search lasted about half an hour, but the cargo was not inspected.</p>
<p>Orders to Anchor, Threatening Words</p>
<p>After the search, the Japanese officer questioned Baden, asking if he had "heard of the Asama Maru incident." Baden replied that he had not. The Japanese officer then described how the Asama Maru had been intercepted by a British warship and 20 German passengers had been taken away. The Japanese officer then asked Baden to provide a written statement that the Japanese soldiers had conducted the search with the captain's permission. Baden refused, stating that he would only write that the Yongsheng had been searched against his objection. The Japanese officer, seeing that Baden would not agree, instructed that the ship was not to proceed, otherwise the Japanese warship would open fire. At 11:45 PM, the Japanese officer led his team off the ship.</p>
<p>Written Statement Leads to Release</p>
<p>At midnight and 6:05 AM the next morning, the Yongsheng sent wireless messages to Japan twice, requesting permission to proceed, but both were rejected by the Japanese warship. At 7:45 AM, the Japanese officer, accompanied by an interpreter and three soldiers, boarded the Yongsheng again, telling Baden that if he provided a written statement that he had permitted the Japanese to search the ship, he would be allowed to proceed. Baden had no choice but to write a statement that the Japanese soldiers had maintained order during the search and had not offended the passengers, but that the search had been conducted without the captain's permission. The Yongsheng was released and set sail at 4:45 AM, heading forward eleven minutes later.</p>
<p>British Navy Plans to Negotiate with Japan</p>
<p>According to a British Navy official who spoke with reporters, "This matter is currently being negotiated with the Japanese authorities." The British Consulate also received a report yesterday, but has taken no action yet. It is unknown what action will be taken without instructions from the British Embassy. The Yongsheng, since being built in Hong Kong in August 1938, has been intercepted by Japanese warships three times in the past 18 months. According to the Continental Daily News, reliable sources say the British authorities plan to protest to the Japanese authorities today (27th) regarding the search of the Yongsheng.</p>
<h3 id="e55">All Sectors of the City Yesterday Commemorated Ma Xiangbo; Over a Thousand People Attended; Grand Memorial Ceremony; General Assembly Officially Bestows on Mr. Ma the Title of "Wenmin" <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>The memorial service for Mr. Ma Xiangbo, organized by all sectors of Shanghai, was held yesterday afternoon at the Huzhou Guild Hall on Guizhou Road. Over a thousand people attended, including representatives from various organizations, friends, and former students of Mr. Ma. The memorial ceremony was extremely grand. The general assembly unanimously passed a resolution to honor Mr. Ma with the posthumous title of "Wenmin" (Cultured and Diligent) as a permanent memorial. The presidium was authorized to plan and handle the matter. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Venue</p>
<p>The memorial venue was solemnly decorated. A colorful silk archway was erected at the entrance of the Huzhou Guild Hall, with a large banner hanging across Guizhou Road reading "Memorial Service for Mr. Ma Xiangbo by All Sectors of Shanghai." Upon entering and ascending the steps, one could see elegiac couplets and plaques sent by various sectors. The registration desk was set up at the entrance to the venue. After registering, attendees were given a special edition of the memorial program and a commemorative badge as souvenirs. There were many couplets and plaques hanging inside the venue. In the center of the mourning hall hung a portrait of Mr. Ma, with the Kuomintang and national flags crossed at the top. On the ceremonial table were placed flowers and other tributes. Candlelight and electric lights shone brightly. A small archway was also erected in front of the stage, with the horizontal plaque of "Chinese Methuselah" by Chairman Lin of the county government in the middle. On both sides were couplets from President Chiang: "Spent his life extensively cultivating talents, nurturing a hundred years of respect for the red tent; even in death he still held righteous indignation, his spirit will forever emulate the yellow flame." Minister Kong's couplet read: "Honored with longevity to a hundred years, closing his eyes still grieved for the thousand misfortunes; at a time of decline, an old man withered, his devoted heart did not see the Nine Provinces united."</p>
<p>Wu Yunzhai's Speech</p>
<p>Chairman Wu Yunzhai delivered the opening remarks: "Today, we from all sectors are commemorating Mr. Ma Xiangbo, a great figure in modern Chinese history. I would like to thank you all for your enthusiastic participation, which shows that the admiration for heroes is the same in everyone's heart. Mr. Ma was a great educator. The two universities he founded, Aurora and Fudan, have produced talents throughout the country. He was a religious leader and a philanthropist. He had a deep love for people and a spirit of saving the country and the world. I remember seeing an article by Mr. Ma about his childhood. At the age of fourteen, he left his hometown alone and went to Xuhui College in Shanghai. At that time, the Taiping Rebellion was raging, so Mr. Ma went to the Taicang area of Suzhou to engage in relief work for refugees. He was also a scholar with profound research in science and literature. He wrote many books, such as 'National Mind Mirror,' 'Simple Explanation of Knowing,' and 'Spiritual Heart History,' and many other books. Even in his old age, he was diligent in learning. At the age of eighty, he began practicing calligraphy, and at the age of ninety, he began learning to paint. The gentleman strives for self-improvement, and Mr. Ma can be said to be worthy of it. When I was young, I had the honor of seeing Mr. Ma's demeanor. His kind and amiable attitude, his upright and bright appearance, and when he started discussing issues, his tone was humorous, and the meaning was righteous and profound. I also remember that at that time, the United States was mistreating Chinese workers, and he led our people to boycott American goods, passionately and indignantly. His patriotic feelings came from sincerity. Although Mr. Ma once said to people, 'I am like a dog, only able to bark, barking for a hundred years, but still have not awakened China,' this was not a word of despair, but a word to stimulate the people. Although the whole of China has not awakened, the general public has made considerable progress today with his hard-hearted leadership. His contribution is indelible. I often think that an extraordinary person is definitely not born into this world for the sake of one's family's warmth and satiety, or a lifetime of ease and comfort, but must make considerable contributions to society and the country, so as not to waste a lifetime. According to the natural process, everyone will die. I feel that a person's lifespan should not be measured by age, but should be calculated based on his life's work and contributions. For example, a person lives to a great age, but he has not benefited society and the country at all, and we should regard him as a short-lived ghost. There is also a person who, although he has not lived to a great age, has already made great achievements for society and the country, and we should often regard him as a long-lived person. Mr. Ma himself said that he barked for a hundred years, so we can say that he has been working to awaken the people all his life, and it can also be said that from the time he had knowledge until he died, he was always struggling to seek welfare for society and the people. Such a person who is both old and has made many contributions is not only a great man in our China, but also a great man in the world. I think that such a great man is spiritually rich. Although his body is dead, his spirit will remain in the world forever. Today, rather than saying that we are mourning him, it is better to say that we are commemorating him. We want to commemorate him, not just by holding a meeting today and that's it, but by seeking ways to commemorate him permanently. There will be proposals later, and I hope you will all support them so that this great man can serve as a model for our descendants."</p>
<p>Memorial Service Situation</p>
<p>After the Chairman's opening remarks, the memorial ceremony began. During the ceremony, the chief officiant was Yu Qiaqing, and the assistant officiants were Wen Lantin and Xu Jiqin. They first took their respective positions, and then the entire audience stood in silence. Yuan Ludeng presented flowers, and Lin Kanghou read the memorial text. Then the entire audience bowed three times, which was extremely solemn and grand. Jiang Kesheng reported on Mr. Ma's life and deeds. Xu Qiufan, Zhao Jinqing, and others delivered eulogies, all praising Mr. Ma's lifelong achievements as a model for the world. Finally, Zhang Chongren, the family representative, delivered a thank you speech. The memorial song was sung by Chen Guangmei leading students from the Shanghai Poor Children's School, the Kunfan Girls' Middle School, and the Shanghai Women and Children's Relief Association. The China Women and Children's Relief Association and the Shanghai Refugee Children's Education and Care Home sent orchestras to play music at the venue.</p>
<p>Posthumous Title of Wenmin</p>
<p>Mr. Fergusson of the presidium sent a letter of recommendation to the general assembly, stating: "I recently received a notice that the memorial service for Mr. Ma Xiangbo is scheduled to be held on January 27th. I regret that I am unable to attend due to other commitments. In the winter of 1887, I lived in Zhenjiang and first heard that Mr. Ma was an outstanding Christian in the area. In 1910, at a welcoming banquet held at Mr. Ma's residence near Jinshan for the American Commercial Delegation, Mr. Ma, representing the Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce, delivered a welcome speech. Because I translated the speech, I first became acquainted with Mr. Ma. The last time I met him was in 1928, and we took a photo together. Mr. Ma was the most famous Christian in China after Xu Guangqi. Emperor Ming posthumously gave Mr. Xu the title of 'Wending Gong' (Cultured and Stable Duke). I propose to honor Mr. Ma with the posthumous title of 'Wenmin' (Cultured and Diligent)." Jiang Yiping of the presidium submitted the proposal to the general assembly for discussion, and it was unanimously resolved to pass the original proposal, honoring him as Wenmin Gong. As for the official conferral ceremony, it will be scheduled for another date due to lack of time. In addition, proposals from Dai Chunfeng, Ying Yongyu, and others to establish a Centennial Hall, a bronze statue, and a library to serve as permanent memorials were all resolved to be authorized to the presidium for planning and handling.</p>

<p>Today is the ninth anniversary of the "January 28th" Shanghai War. All sectors of the city, at a time when the full-scale war of resistance continues to evolve, and final victory is not far off, commemorate the martyrs who died for their country, and increase vigilance. However, due to the special environment, no ceremonies are held. However, in order to practice the significance of commemoration with action and express the determination to support national policy, citizens from all walks of life in the city, in addition to voluntarily stopping entertainment and banquets to express their grief, are also actively implementing wartime economy, promoting national construction savings, and at the same time intensifying efforts in refugee relief and spring military support movements, so as to assist the government in completing the great cause of resistance and reconstruction. The Japanese and puppet forces, fearing that the Chinese army would take the opportunity to attack, have stepped up defenses everywhere. The authorities of the two concessions have also made temporary emergency preparations. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Five Iron Gates Closed Today</p>
<p>Today is the ninth anniversary of "January 28th." In addition to the Public Concession Police Department deciding to take special precautions to prevent incidents and increasing the number of Chinese and Western detectives patrolling everywhere, it is reported that the French Concession authorities have decided to temporarily block traffic at all road junctions along Avenue Edward VII, except for the important traffic intersections such as the Bund, Zhengjia Muqiao, Dongxin Bridge, Great World, and Rue Sainte-Marie, from zero o'clock this morning (28th) by erecting barbed wire. All curfew measures will continue to be implemented as usual. As for the five iron gates leading to Nanshi (Chinese city) - Xieqiao, Nanyangqiao, Xingiao Street, Diandang Street, and Xinkai River - it is reported that the Japanese requested that they be closed for one day today and prohibited from passing, and will be reopened tomorrow as usual. Theaters in the French Concession, such as the Golden Theater and the Grand Stage, will be closed for one day.</p>
<p>All Bridges on the Suzhou Creek Blocked</p>
<p>All bridges over the Suzhou Creek in the Public Concession will be blocked today, following the precedent of the "January 28th" commemorations in 1918. The Xinza Road Bridge and Wuzhen Road Bridge will only allow vehicles to pass. The Laoza Road Bridge will only allow pedestrians to pass. The Tianhou Temple Bridge will allow both vehicles and pedestrians to pass. As for other road intersections, such as the Sichuan Road Bridge, Zhapu Road Bridge, Waibaidu Bridge, and the section of roads from North Jiangxi Road to North Henan Road, in addition to using barbed wire to block pedestrians and vehicles where necessary, more Chinese and Western detectives will be stationed at the open bridges and road intersections to protect them.</p>
<h3 id="e57">Fifth Batch of Fractional Currency About to Be Printed <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>After the Ministry of Finance approved the Central Bank's issuance of fractional currency notes, it was entrusted to the American Yung Ning Company for printing, and the Central Bank's Shanghai Branch was responsible for issuing and circulating them in the market. A reporter from the New Sound News Agency recently learned from the bank that four batches of fractional currency notes have been issued, each batch being 500,000 yuan, totaling 2 million yuan. They are all 1-fen and 5-fen notes and are now widely circulating in the market. The fifth batch of 500,000 yuan is about to be printed and will be issued in succession to the four batches. Whether or not more will be printed will depend on market needs.</p>
<h3 id="e58">Attempt to Interfere with Real Estate After the Opening of Nanshi <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese Military Police stationed in Nanshi, the Nanshi Special Affairs Agency, and the Nanshi puppet "Government Affairs Office," recently incited by the Japanese "Asia Development Board Shanghai Political Affairs Bureau," have not only opened the iron gates along the Minquan Road area, but also widely opened flower shops, gambling houses, and formed a "Revival of Nanshi Committee." It is understood that the puppet Land Bureau is coercing real estate owners in the entire Nanshi area to accept the puppet side's orders, implement registration, and the deadline set is very short. If they fail to register by the deadline, they will be confiscated. All the owners have firmly refused. It is rumored that the "Revival Association," jointly formed by the Japanese and puppets, believes that after the opening of Nanshi, the number of citizens returning is still extremely sparse, and has ordered all real estate owners to follow the deadline and recall the tenants who previously lived there. This statement has not been confirmed, nor is there such a method.</p>
<h3 id="e59">Chamber of Commerce Telegraphed to Request the Lifting of the Ban on Products of the Da Ye Factory; The Factory Was Not Seized or Controlled <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Economic Affairs yesterday: "To the Chongqing Ministry of Economic Affairs, regarding the case of the Da Ye Cotton Textile Factory's products being banned, according to the Chamber of Commerce's investigation, the original site of the factory was destroyed in the war and has long been relocated to the neutral defense zone in the concession, and there is no case of seizure or control. On December 18th of last year, the factory submitted the photography documents and requested the lifting of the ban. The document was sent by mail. We feared that the lifting of the ban would be delayed, so we also specially telegraphed the request in the same month, hoping to lift the ban by telegram. It is expected to arrive early, but there has been no reply. The factory's business is obstructed and in great difficulty. We hereby telegraph again and request you to lift the ban quickly. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce respectfully bows."</p>

<h3 id="e60">Shanghai Municipal Police Department's Armored Vehicle Prohibited from Passing by the Japanese Side; Used the Fact That the Indian Constable Was Carrying a Rifle as an Excuse; Originally Agreed, but Suddenly Obstructed; The Labor Dispute at the Yi Zhong Tobacco Factory Was Fortunately Resolved <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>The North-China Daily News reports that the Shanghai Municipal Police Department received a report yesterday afternoon (26th) that the workers at the Yi Zhong Tobacco Company's Huade Road factory were going on strike. From 3:00 PM onwards, labor and management began negotiations. Although there were various reasons to believe that the dispute could be resolved amicably, if it could not be resolved, the workers might lose control. In view of the fact that there were very few police officers in the police stations on the north bank of the Suzhou Creek, the police department decided to order the reserve team</p>
<p>To Prepare to Depart</p>
<p>To prevent the unexpected. To avoid delays, senior police officers were sent to meet with the Japanese authorities and agree that the reserve team could be sent to the north bank of the Suzhou Creek when needed. It was stipulated that the police department personnel would handle everything inside the factory, and the Japanese Marine Corps would</p>
<p>Maintain Order</p>
<p>Outside the factory. According to the wishes of the Marine Corps authorities, two armored vehicles of the reserve team would go, carrying only 52 Western and Indian constables from the police department. The Thompson submachine guns on the armored vehicles would be removed. If needed, all the police officers from the Jianlin Road police station would assist the reserve team in handling matters. All these points were agreed upon by both parties. The police department then dispatched two armored vehicles towards Hongkou at nearly 4:00 PM. When they arrived at the</p>
<p>Waibaidu Bridge (Garden Bridge)</p>
<p>The Japanese sentry there immediately called the headquarters for instructions. A Japanese Marine Corps officer arrived on the scene to inspect the two vehicles. Just as the armored vehicles were about to cross the bridge, the Japanese officer suddenly refused to allow them to pass, claiming that the Indian constable was carrying a rifle. It must be clarified that the rifle is the</p>
<p>Standard Weapon</p>
<p>Of the Indian constables in the reserve team, and was agreed upon by the Japanese authorities during the negotiations yesterday afternoon. The two sides then negotiated at the head of the bridge for 30 minutes. As a result, the two armored vehicles were unable to pass and returned to the Gordon Road police station via North Suzhou Road and Zhapu Road Bridge. At 5:15 PM, one armored vehicle, carrying</p>
<p>Foreign Police Officers</p>
<p>Finally managed to pass the Waibaidu Bridge and arrived at the Yi Zhong Tobacco Company's Huade Road factory. The workers at the factory were demanding allowances and began a slowdown yesterday afternoon. However, they soon resumed work while negotiations were underway. When the reserve team arrived at the factory, the negotiations had been successfully concluded.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury reports that among the U.S. military transport ships sailing between the U.S. Pacific coast and the Far East, there are the USS Chaumont and the USS Henderson. It is reported that two new ships will replace the USS Chaumont and the USS Henderson, totaling three ships, which will take turns sailing between the U.S. Pacific coast and the Far East once a month. The names of the two new ships are unknown, but it is understood that they will begin operations in the Far East in early summer. The USS Henderson departed Shanghai at 10:00 AM this morning (28th), carrying some personnel from the 4th Marine Regiment, and will return to the U.S. via the Maway and Guam Islands. The U.S. Asiatic Fleet light cruiser USS Marblehead will depart Shanghai early Sunday morning for Manila and is expected to return to Shanghai in late February.</p>

<h3 id="e63">The Situation in Shaoxing and Linpu Turns Stable: Ningbo Ships Arrive in Shanghai Yesterday; Yongjin Highway Closed; Shanghai-Shaoxing Telegraph Line Temporarily Cut <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>After the enemy secretly crossed the Qiantang River and landed, they invaded Xiaoshan and Shaoxing in two routes, east and south. The Chinese army blocked them, and the situation has improved. The Japanese troops at Kanshan are about to be wiped out. The Japanese troops in Xiaoshan have retreated to Xixing on the river bank and fled back to Hangzhou. A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency learned from fellow villagers that those who arrived in Shanghai from Toupeng reported that the Japanese army's secret crossing of the Qiantang River landed at Kanshan Toupeng, and at the same time landed at Xixing under the cover of artillery and aircraft. The Japanese army that landed at Kanshan Toupeng attempted to invade Shaoxing, and the Japanese army that landed at Xixing attempted to invade Linpu in Xiaoshan. It is said that after the fierce resistance of the Chinese army, it is not difficult to annihilate the landed Japanese troops. According to a reporter from the Datong News Agency, who learned from reliable groups in Shanghai from Zhejiang Province, the association has received a telegram from Yuyao stating that "the Japanese army in Xiaoshan is surrounded." Yuyao is peaceful. According to the above telegram, it is inferred that the Japanese army is obviously only entrenched in Xiaoshan. The situation in Ningbo and Shaoxing is becoming more stable. According to news received by the financial community in this city, on the evening of the 24th, the Japanese army in Xiaoshan and Shaoxing invaded Qianqing again. On the morning of the 25th, six Japanese planes flew to Shengxian and dropped more than 20 bombs, destroying more than 170 houses. At that time, the situation was indeed extremely critical. The authorities had ordered the evacuation of the population. However, the shipping industry in this city received a telegram from Ningbo at 3:30 p.m. yesterday stating, "The Japanese troops invading Shaoxing have been defeated and retreated to Xiaoshan. Shaoxing is still safe. The Japanese troops in Linpu have also been wiped out." Therefore, it is sufficient to prove that the situation in Shaoxing and Linpu has turned from danger to safety. Zhejiang people in Shanghai can finally rest assured.</p>
<p>Datang and Deping Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</p>
<p>The Datang ship, represented by Norwegian Merchant Hualun &amp; Co., arrived in Shanghai from Zhenhai at 8:00 a.m. yesterday and berthed at the Bund Garden Pier, carrying a large amount of paper, vegetables, and local products. According to the crew, Ningbo is peaceful, and the people are calm. The long-distance telephone to Shaoxing is still working, but the highway to Jinhua is completely closed for passenger and freight transportation due to military reasons. Therefore, various guilds in Shanghai, Fujian, and Jiangxi have temporarily suspended the shipment of goods. The ship is scheduled to continue sailing to Zhenhai today or tomorrow. The Deping ship of the Italian-Chinese Company sent a telegram to Shanghai yesterday, reporting that it had left Zhenhai for Shanghai in the afternoon yesterday and was scheduled to arrive in Shanghai at 9:00 a.m. today. Due to a lack of coal, it was approved to enter Songkou and berth last night and will continue sailing from Shanghai to Zhenhai tomorrow. It is said that the ship is carrying a large number of passengers to Shanghai. As for Taizhou and Wenzhou on the coast of Zhejiang, the authorities have taken strict precautions and evacuated people from counties and cities. However, Japanese warships are often found along the coast of Zhejiang. There are currently two Japanese warships anchored outside Zhenhai Port, firing at Zhenhai and Longshan from time to time. Because the Chinese army is heavily guarded, they dare not land easily. There are currently Kangsha Yi, Haida, Binli, Haily and other ships outside Zhenhai Port, loading and unloading passengers and cargo.</p>
<p>Shanghai-Shaoxing Telegraph Line Temporarily Interrupted</p>
<p>Until yesterday before departure, relevant groups in Ningbo and Shaoxing in this city had not received any telegrams from the local area indicating any unrest. However, telegrams between Shanghai and Shaoxing have been temporarily suspended because Shaoxing is evacuating its population, and telegrams to Shaoxing cannot be delivered. Those sending telegrams to Shanghai cannot send them out because local military telegrams are crowded. The above suspension is not due to any unrest in Shaoxing.</p>
<p>Merchants Return Home, Ningbo Market Depressed</p>
<p>Merchants from Ningbo, Shaoxing, along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, and the Hunan-Guizhou area had previously gathered in Ningbo to purchase goods from Shanghai. Now, due to the outbreak of war, they have cancelled orders to Shanghai. They have also settled accounts and left in a hurry, resulting in a sharp decline in cargo transportation between Shanghai and Ningbo and a depressed market in Ningbo. Furthermore, due to the evacuation of the population, the urban area is unusually deserted. As for the rumor that Ningbo was bombed, it is said that a foreign ship outside Zhenhai Port sent a telegram in Italian to an Italian manager in Shanghai the other day, stating that it saw Japanese planes bombing Ningbo from outside Zhenhai Port. Therefore, it was widely rumored in this city that Ningbo was bombed. However, a reporter from the Datong News Agency learned from the shipping industry that the above rumor is absolutely not true.</p>

<h3 id="e67">Thirty Officers and Soldiers of British Gunboat Arrived in Shanghai from Ningbo Yesterday; They Will Reside Here Temporarily and Return to Serve Their Country Soon; They Felt Very Tired Along the Way from Hunan <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>The English-language Da Mei Wan Bao reported that the British gunboat, HMS Sandpiper, is now docked in Changsha. Thirty officers and soldiers of the ship, in accordance with the resolution of the British Admiralty, will all return to serve their country. They departed from the ship in Changsha on the 15th of this month, taking the route of Xiangtan, Ji'an, Xingguo, Yingtan, Jinhua, and Xikou to Ningbo, a journey of 950 miles. They then took the Weilun Datang from Ningbo, arriving in Shanghai this morning (27th). They disembarked at the Beijing Road Wharf. The group was led by Major Balh of the Royal Navy. Pastor Peck of the Mei Yi Mei Church in Changsha served as an interpreter and accompanied them to Ningbo. Among them was a sailor named Bairangshi who suffered from rheumatism since his departure from Changsha and felt more pain from the cold along the way. Therefore, he was sent to the British military hospital after landing. Most of the thirty people had thick beards. Only a few had time to tidy up their appearance when they briefly stayed in Jinhua due to air raid alarms. After landing, they all showed happy expressions. However, they were eager to unload their luggage this morning and did not want to talk in detail about their journey. They only said that the prices of cigarettes and alcohol in Changsha were very expensive. They mostly ate canned meat and biscuits along the way. They only enjoyed four meals of rich Chinese cuisine when they stayed in larger cities. They were eager to come to Shanghai as soon as possible and had no intention of admiring the scenery along the way. Before long, they finished unloading their luggage and took trucks to the British Association on Maybaik Road for temporary residence. They will soon return to England to serve in active duty.</p>
<h3 id="e68">Review of Shanghai Industry in 1939 (2) – Report No. 3 of the Public Works Department <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>The above-mentioned various chemicals, as well as others, are necessary for several kinds of daily necessities manufacturing processes. There are eight monosodium glutamate factories. In view of the obvious drop in exchange rates, it is profitable to transport goods for export, so they seized the opportunity to step up production. However, near the end of the year, due to competition from the same industry and restrictions on imports in Singapore, production was greatly reduced. The pharmaceutical industry is quite developed, with three new or expanded pharmaceutical factories manufacturing various finished medicines, serums, and common hospital supplies.</p>
<p>The manufacturing of cosmetics, soaps, and toothpastes has also made significant progress. Many newly built factory buildings and lane houses have been used by these factories. The industry of manufacturing tin tubes for toothpaste has also developed along with it. The tin tubes are used to package toothpaste made locally or imported in bulk from abroad and packaged locally. There are five such factories, with a total daily output of 110,000 pieces. Glass factories are rushing to produce glass bottles for local packaging of cosmetics to meet the needs of customers in the local area and overseas, and the glass bottles are shipped directly overseas for sale. The increase in the sales of cosmetics in the industrial area has increased the demand for products made in this city. Seven factories for refining peppermint oil and manufacturing peppermint lozenges have been opened. These two products have found a market in the Americas. Farmers in the countryside are planting peppermint, hoping to get more profit than other agricultural products.</p>
<p>Other Industries: In addition to manufacturing cosmetic bottles, the glass industry factories have little work to do. There are more than 100 such factories, large and small, with simple equipment and difficult to improve. The prices of raw materials used by the enamel industry factories have soared, and many of them (including black steel plates) must be transported from abroad, but the business is still very prosperous. Some have temporarily reduced production due to the high prices of imported raw materials. The rubber shoe industry has been sluggish throughout the year. Since the tightening of foreign exchange, prices have increased, and sales in this city have been greatly affected. Moreover, all rubber shoe products are regarded as military supplies, so they cannot be transported to the occupied areas. Only a few factories north of the Suzhou River can trade with the Yangtze River basin. One factory has started to manufacture rubber products using the dipping method, the technique of which was introduced by Jewish refugees. In addition, surgical supplies, balloons, and rubber elastic bands are also new products of these factories. A new factory is manufacturing leather balls. The thermos factories have developed rapidly, and as a result, two of them have been able to build new-style factory buildings to replace the workshops previously located in the alleyways. Overseas sales have reached as far as the Philippines, Malaya, the South Sea Islands, and the Americas. Their products are not prohibited by the Singapore government, so the future is very promising. Among the factories for making paper and paper products, seven are newly established after the war, with an average daily output of 67.5 tons. Most of the products are transported to India and the South Sea Islands. A power cord factory, previously located in Zhabei, has resumed work in the concession, employing about 200 workers. A new-style factory for manufacturing light bulbs has also started work. There are 33 factories in the electric bulb industry, most of which have sprung up in the past year (to be continued).</p>
<h3 id="e69">Suppressing Criminal Incidents: Hoping for Cooperation Between Citizens and Concession Authorities <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Before each Spring Festival, various criminal incidents in this city tend to increase. At this extraordinary time, the authorities must implement emergency precautions. However, such precautions will be ineffective unless the citizens of this city cooperate with the authorities. If the citizens remember the spirit of public welfare and their responsibilities as citizens, and immediately notify the police of unusual matters, it will make it easier for armed criminals to be brought to justice. It is now being proven that timely calls for help from the public, or reports to nearby patrols, can lead to the arrest of criminals or the recovery of lost property. Cooperation between the authorities and the public can suppress all criminal occurrences. Often, the carelessness of servants in opening doors allows criminals to break in. When hearing a knock on the door or ringing the bell, if citizens can carefully identify the visitors, many criminals will have no way to break in.</p>
<h3 id="e70">Asia Hotel Raided for Gambling Den: Boss and Gamblers Fined Separately <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>At about 11:00 p.m. the night before last (the 26th), the French Concession Police Department received a tip-off that someone had set up a large-scale gambling den in Room 409 of the Asia Hotel at 135 Avenue Edward VII, openly gathering gamblers and charging a cut. The department sent Chinese and Western detectives to the address. At that time, the room was full of gambling cries, rolling dice, and high spirits. The detectives surrounded the room and arrested the boss, Zhu Hongsheng, and 37 gamblers, including Wu Shuangyuan, Wu Yanbing, Wu Xulin, Bao Yuanzhi, and Ma Jinshan. They also seized a large amount of gambling money and a set of gambling equipment and brought them to the police station. Yesterday, they were escorted to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court for investigation. After Judge Wu Kechou interrogated them one by one, he announced the judgment in court. Zhu Hongsheng was sentenced to six months of imprisonment for attempting to make a profit and gathering people to gamble. If he was allowed to pay a fine in lieu of imprisonment, it would be at the rate of two yuan per day. Wu Shuangyuan and Wu Yanbing were each fined 100 yuan, and Wu Xulin and the other 34 people were each fined 30 yuan. The gambling money and gambling equipment were confiscated.</p>

<p>Teng Jinshan, a native of Tianjin, 52 years old, resides at No. 21, Tongyi Lane, Danshui Road. Recently, under the alias Wang Jinhai, he and Yang Tianxiang, a well-known gangster from Tianjin, and the fugitive Li Jian, etc., relied on special labor to engage in the transportation of drugs and accumulated a large debt. Unexpectedly, Teng and others were raided by the French police while transporting opium at the Roosevelt Wharf late on the 28th of last month. At that time, 2,000 taels of opium, worth more than 100,000 yuan, were seized, and a total of 13 suspects were arrested one after another. Judge Miao Qingbang of the Second Special District Court heard the case and detained the defendants. The details have been reported in this newspaper. The case was opened again yesterday for continued interrogation. After the police lawyer stated the facts of the case, Wang Jinhai, Yang Tianxiang, Li Huaian, Ma Ji, and Li Shufang were prosecuted in accordance with Article 257 of the Criminal Code for transporting and selling drugs. Wang Chunnian, Wen Xingren, Guo Zhiyuan, Sun Zhaozhong, Hao Zhengrong, Wu Wanxiang, Chen Yushan, and Liu Binlai were not prosecuted due to insufficient evidence. Judge Miao reviewed the case and, upon interrogating the defendants, ruled that since the police did not prosecute Wang Chunnian and the other eight, they were allowed to be released in court. The remaining defendants were remanded in custody to await further interrogation on February 6th.</p>

<p>Lin Runqing, a local resident of No. 16, Miaolong, Jing'an Temple Road, recently died of illness, leaving behind a son named Zhipu, who was only four years old. He recently suffered from a cough and was prescribed medicine by a doctor to take home. Because Runqing had a habit of smoking before his death, he had a bottle of anti-smoking medication, which was also placed on the table in the room. At about 10:00 p.m. the night before last, his mother mistakenly gave Zhipu the anti-smoking medication to mix with water and drink. Before long, the toxicity erupted, causing him to vomit violently. Only then did she realize her mistake. She rushed him to the hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective. He died at about 4:00 a.m. at dawn.</p>
<h3 id="e73">British Embassy in Nanjing Robbed at Night: 500 Yuan or 50,000 Yuan Stolen; Thieves Seem to Be Familiar with the Internal Situation of the Embassy <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>The Zi Lin Bao reported that the Japanese-language Continental New Daily reported yesterday (the 26th) that the British Embassy in Nanjing was robbed on the night of Thursday. There were three robbers in total. One of them was holding a handgun. Shortly after midnight on Thursday, he went to the British Embassy and knocked on the door. Two Chinese gatekeepers at the embassy thought that the visitors were local officials who came for urgent business, so they opened the door. After the three entered, they tied up the two gatekeepers, stuffed their mouths to prevent them from making a sound. Then, two robbers kept watch outside, and one robber went inside, opened the safe, and stole 500 yuan before escaping. It is believed that the three robbers were familiar with the internal situation of the embassy because one robber went straight to the safe to rob after the gatekeepers were tied up. Japanese military police and consulate police are currently investigating the case. The English-language Da Mei Wan Bao reported that the cash stolen by the three robbers was as much as 50,000 yuan, which was the money of the Gu Zhong Tobacco Company, which was being held in safekeeping by a member of the British Embassy. If it is lost, they are not responsible.</p>

<p>Wang Binhe Shaoxing Hotel, located at No. 601 Fuzhou Road in the Public Concession, the lower floor of the Shenzhou Hotel, has been established for many years and is very popular. Most of its customers are high-end merchants. At about 8:00 p.m. last night, three Japanese (surnames unknown) suddenly drove to the hotel to buy wine. The waiter led them to Room 54 upstairs. Because of the regulations of the police station, they reported the situation to the Old Gate Police Station. The three Japanese ordered more dishes and heated wine. After drinking until about 11:00 p.m., one of the Japanese, who was drunk and violent, suddenly had an argument with a waiter and took out a handgun from his arms and fired a shot, piercing the floor. Fortunately, no one was injured. The diners and waiters in each room fled down the stairs in droves when the gunshot rang. The hotel's cashier urgently reported to the police station, and three police cars rushed to the scene and arrested two of the Japanese. The other one took the opportunity to escape without a trace. It was learned later that the waiter knew the three Japanese who often went to the hotel to drink.</p>

<p>Ji Taixiang Women's Underwear Company, located at No. 455 Jing'an Temple Road, usually entrusts Xu Guisheng, a Suzhou tailor, to handle the embroidered clothing materials it produces. Unexpectedly, Xu recently embezzled 127 pieces of clothing material and pawned them for 90 yuan. Xu Songzhou, the owner of the company, discovered this and reported it to the Chengdu Road Police Station. Detective Wu Junqing was sent to arrest Xu Guisheng. He was escorted to the First Special District Court yesterday morning. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin requested a postponement because the stolen goods had not been recovered. The court ruled that Xu Guisheng be held in custody pending further investigation.</p>

<p>Qian Yiying, a deceased shareholder of Ruichang Hardware Store, a native of Ningbo, only had one daughter, Ruilan, with his wife, Chen. For the sake of succession, he also took Ms. Wang (45 years old this year), a fellow villager, as his concubine, who lived in his hometown and had one son and two daughters. The son is named Qichang, who is 26 years old this year. The two daughters are named Xueqin, who is 22 years old this year, and Wenxian, who is 13 years old this year.</p>
<p>Qichang is Married</p>
<p>The eldest and second daughters are also married. Later, Chen died, and Qian married Ms. Ren (32 years old this year), also a fellow villager, as his second wife. They lived together at No. 26, third floor, Dali Mansion, No. 14 Xin Yong'an Street, French Concession, this city, and had assets. Qian's concubine, Ms. Wang, moved to Shanghai with her son, daughter in law, and young daughter, and lived at No. 73, Tai'an Lane, North Shanxi Road. Qian Yiying died of illness in Shanghai on November 12th of last year. The inheritance was all managed by Qian's second wife, Ms. Qian Ren. Qian's concubine, Ms. Wang, and her children asked Ms. Ren to</p>
<p>Divide the Property</p>
<p>Ms. Ren showed a will made by Qian when he was dying and refused to hand it over for distribution. Therefore, Qian's concubine, Ms. Wang, together with her son, Qichang, daughters, Xueqin, and Wenxian, etc., entrusted lawyer Chen Wencan to act as their agent and filed a petition with the Civil Court of the Second Special District Court against Ms. Qian Ren, requesting mediation and the handing over of Qian Yiying's property for division. Because the mediation failed, they formally filed a lawsuit, requesting the court to order Ms. Ren to hand over the property inventory, including 20.5 mu of farmland in Longjiang Jiatian, three houses, 1,200 yuan of shares in Ruichang Hardware Store, 8-9,000 yuan of deposits in Yu Daheng Sugar Bank, and 600 yuan of deposits in Feiwen Silver Shop. The court, based on the petition,</p>
<p>Opened a Trial</p>
<p>yesterday by Judge Ma Yishu. Both parties were represented by lawyers. First, the plaintiff's lawyer stated the previous situation. The defendant was represented by lawyers Yuan Hanyun and Xiao Baichuan, who presented the will and handwriting as evidence and stated that all the property had been disposed of in the will and that there was no other property. The court examined the will and interrogated Qian's concubine, Ms. Wang, and Qian Qichang. Since the case was clear, it ordered a debate and then announced the conclusion of the trial. The judgment was scheduled to be announced on the 30th, and the plaintiff was ordered to pay 9 yuan in litigation fees, according to the 10,000 yuan subject matter, 270 yuan should be paid, and the plaintiff was ordered to pay the litigation fees within three days, and await the verdict.</p>

<p>Xu Shounian, a native of Jiangbei, lives at No. 28, Lane 379, Haifang Road. He usually uses counterfeit one-yuan banknotes of the Central Bank to mix with vendors and rickshaw pullers. Those who have been harmed by him are all poor laborers, which is despicable. In the afternoon of the other day, Xu used his old trick again. He hired a rickshaw pulled by Chen Afu on Moore Road to Chengdu Road, stating that the fare was one jiao. After arriving, Xu immediately took out a Central One-Yuan</p>
<p>Counterfeit Coin and Asked for Change</p>
<p>Chen initially refused, but Xu was willing to add five cents, so Chen agreed and took it to a nearby cigarette and paper shop to exchange it, only to find out that it was a counterfeit coin. So he called the police and arrested Xu at the Chengdu Road Police Station. Chinese detective Cui Chengke and detective Tian Changchun searched him and found seven counterfeit one-yuan banknotes of the Central Bank, fifteen two-jiao and one two and a half jiao genuine notes. Then they went to his residence and found ten counterfeit one-yuan banknotes and forty-five counterfeit two-jiao banknotes.</p>
<p>Ordered to Be Taken Into Custody</p>
<p>He was escorted to the Second Court Police Station yesterday morning. Lawyer Zhang Tianyin prosecuted him according to law and stated that the defendant admitted in the police station that the counterfeit banknotes were bought from Miao Da and requested a postponement. After Judge Fu interrogated the witness, rickshaw puller Chen Fu, and the defendant, he ordered him to be held in custody pending further interrogation and took out one yuan in legal tender from the stolen goods as compensation for Chen Afu's loss. It is said that the main criminal Miao Da was also arrested at 8:30 a.m. yesterday at the Xinxing Tea House at No. 3804 Robison Road.</p>

<p>Han Zhuqing, a Shaoxing native who worked as a silversmith, was 46 years old and lived in the back building of No. 13, Lane 185, Rue Massenet. His wife had divorced him not long ago. One night, at 9 p.m., Han was working alone in his room when, due to carelessness in melting silver ingots, a fire broke out and quickly spread, bursting through the roof and becoming uncontrollable. Han, along with a young woman from Pudong, Yu Ling (24 years old, whose husband Yu Gaosheng worked for J.R. Morse &amp; Co.), who had recently married and lived on the same floor, were trapped and unable to escape, perishing in the inferno. The fire brigade arrived and extinguished the blaze, but it had already spread to neighboring houses. Afterwards, firefighters retrieved the bodies of the man and woman and sent them to the autopsy room of the Tongren Fuyuan branch. Yesterday, the bodies were identified. Yu Ling was claimed and prepared for burial by her husband, Yu Gaosheng. However, since Han had no family in Shanghai, the charitable organization assumed responsibility for the burial, awaiting family to claim the body. Both bodies were severely burned, charred, and dismembered, a gruesome sight.</p>

<h3 id="e80">Letter to the Editor <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>We are writing on behalf of our client, the manager, to state that we have read the report on the 27th regarding the arrest of the hat-snatching gang led by Zhao Yuelong, in which it was mentioned that our pawnshop accepted stolen goods and excessively increased the pawn value to seek profit. This does not accord with the facts. Our pawnshop has been in business for many years, and the pawn value is determined based on the quality of the pawned items. We have never inflated or deflated the value. The allegation that we deliberately accepted stolen goods for profit is even more unfounded. This matter concerns the reputation of our pawnshop, and we have specially requested that you publish a correction to avoid confusion. We hereby request that you investigate and make the necessary correction. Respectfully, Attorney Weng Weixian, January 27th.</p>
<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>We have just read in today's newspaper a translated article from the North-China Daily News titled "Political Assassination Plot," which describes the incident of my residence being raided by gangsters. Upon investigation, four gangsters broke in and claimed to be extorting protection money. Consequently, all members of my household were free to move around. Although one or two rooms were ransacked, they found only a few hundred yuan in cash. At that time, a servant girl slipped away to a neighbor's house to call the police, and the gangsters were subsequently apprehended. The police officers discovered only three old pistols and four mismatched bullets, which were essentially unusable. This can be verified with the detectives at the Chengdu Road Police Station who handled the case. Therefore, this incident was a common extortion case and calling it an assassination plot is far-fetched. We hereby request a correction. With utmost sincerity, Zhou Bangjun, 29.1.27.</p>

<h3 id="e98">Grain: Du Rice Has Only a Touch of Trade; The Price of Foreign Rice Soars Higher <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Since the rice market rose continuously for several days, yesterday it remained in this state. The reason is that inland sources, such as early and late rice from Nangang and other places, arrive daily, but mostly only in batches of one to two thousand bags. Other areas, except for Qing Si and other districts, also have some arrivals from time to time. As for goods from Changshu, Wuxi, Suzhou, and Tongxiang, they have long been monopolized by certain parties, exclusively for export. It is impossible to transport them again. The needs of Shanghai's residents are vast. The stock in warehouses was previously abundant, but recently, there has been more outflow than inflow. It is rumored in the market that warehouses still have 130,000 to 140,000 bags of foreign rice, while the stock of other domestic rice is less than 100,000 bags. Moreover, the price of foreign rice from Saigon and other places has risen in the place of origin. Combined with exchange rates in Shanghai, it is difficult to make a profit, so new orders have been temporarily suspended. Year-end sales have suddenly become brisk, giving speculators an opportunity. Merchants are hoarding for higher prices, resulting in step-by-step increases. Domestic rice in the market, especially rice from Changshu and Wuxi, is sometimes transported, mostly through direct transactions to avoid interference. In addition, only a small amount of Lisheng Jing rice is opened according to limits. The rest is only Qing Si thin rice, Nangang early and late rice, and Baiyuan. These thin rice and early and late rice used to sell poorly. Although sales are now active, transactions are sporadic. Therefore, the situation seems quite tight, and prices have only increased by 30 to 50 cents. Nangang early and late rice is priced at 39.5 yuan, and thin rice is still at 40 yuan, but the quality is already a step lower. Baiyuan rice is in line with the Jing rice market, but it is not subject to restrictions. Special goods are already priced at 40.05 yuan. As for Lu Yang Jian, when its sources were smooth, it was originally a supplementary product. The amount arriving was limited. Later, it was heavily restricted by foreign rice, and transporters had no profit, so it has long been unavailable. Some stocks that remained in warehouses from before have also been depleted with daily sales. Therefore, no samples are seen trading in the market.</p>
<p>The fact that foreign rice sources are congested, yet market prices have been rising step by step, indicates the obvious speculation, manipulation, and monopolization. Yesterday, new transactions of No. 2 Saigon rice continued, with 400 to 500 tons at a price of 48.7 yuan, taking exchange rate increases into consideration. Similar goods also had 200 to 300 tons at the same price. Broken rice had a return of 100 tons, priced at 37.85 yuan. Currently, foreign rice shops, rural customers, and demand are all greedy. Large speculators, both within and outside the industry, are particularly active, raising prices step by step. It was once shouted up to 42 yuan, but ultimately, due to the price being too high, it was difficult to make a deal, with the actual selling price at 41.5 yuan, but still 70 to 80 cents to nearly a yuan higher than the previous closing price. No. 2 Saigon opened at 40.02 yuan, then dropped to 39.7 yuan. Huo Jiao opened at 40 yuan, then 39.8 yuan. Siam Su Jian was at 40 yuan, Tokyo Yang Jian was specially priced from 38 yuan, then dropped to 37.3 to 37.4 yuan. Saigon broken rice was at 32 yuan and 31.6 yuan. No. 2 rice leaves were at 36.2 to 36.5 yuan. Their rise is similar to that of No. 1 Saigon rice. Statistics show that the total transaction volume of domestic and foreign rice in the city was over 20,000 bags.</p>
<p>Large quantities of foreign rice are transshipped from Hong Kong via Shanghai to North China. Yesterday, Jardine Matheson's Yong Sheng ship transported over 14,100 bags, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. Today, Swire's Haikou ship brought 850 bags from Hong Kong, and another 9,600 bags were transshipped to North China, including 2,760 bags to Qingdao, 110 bags to Weihaiwei, 1,637 bags to Yantai, and the most to Tianjin, totaling 5,165 bags.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Manipulating Flour: Supernatural Skill; Manufacturers Say Prices Will Increase <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Although the wholesale price of No. 2 flour is still 10 yuan, the actual wholesale sales by manufacturers are scarce, and it is difficult to buy. There are cases of people voluntarily increasing the price to request as much supply as possible. The rumor that flour mills plan to increase prices by half a yuan at the beginning of next week shows that the manufacturers' claim of maintaining street sales is completely deceitful. They deliberately restrict supply, forcing buyers to automatically increase prices to get their orders fulfilled. The manipulation has reached a supernatural level. In this environment, returned goods become increasingly sought after. Those holding warehouse receipts are all holding on, intending to determine their strategy after observing the manufacturers' actual increase in prices. Therefore, the Green Cannon carriage has a shout price of 12 yuan, but there is activity and no market. Foreign flour is also doing the same and hoarding. Total transactions in the city are less than 10,000 bags. We await to see how the market changes at the beginning of next week.</p>
<p>The wheat market situation is also secretly tight. Amid rising prices for various food grains, merchants and hoarders are constantly pushing up prices. Open sales are still at 20 yuan for Suchangyang wheat and 19.9 yuan and 19.85 yuan for Yangzhou wheat, with 800 bags handled by the Fuxin factory. Otherwise, there are no public transactions. It is said that Yangzhou wheat opened at 19.8 yuan the day before yesterday and secretly rose another 5 to 10 cents yesterday. Based on this situation, a new high price is feared to be realized at the beginning of next week.</p>

<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw HSBC's listed prices remain unchanged. In the unofficial market for British and American exchange, there was only half a day of trading, and the situation became increasingly quiet. Most operators were watching and waiting. However, Hong Kong cables were still being sold off, so the results continued to show a slight easing to 0.03125 and 0.0625. The morning opening was flat. Subsequently, due to the supply of Hong Kong cables, a slight easing was seen. However, the yarn and cotton trading firms suddenly came in to buy, and it was rumored that speculators in Hong Kong were also purchasing. Therefore, the rates once returned to flat, but ultimately, because Hong Kong cables resumed selling, coupled with some banks also intending to sell, the rates became unsustainable, and hardened again, rising to four pence 7/34375 and 7.875 yuan. Trading was sluggish at noon, and the situation was settled. Until the noon close, there were no changes, and all rates remained on par with the upper prices. The underlying trend of futures was slightly closer to the spot rates.</p>

After opening, the market was quiet and showed no significant changes. HSBC's listed rates remained unchanged, and the silver balance tax increased by 0.0075. After that, Hong Kong cables slightly came in to sell, and the situation slightly hardened, with HSBC selling spot British gold at 4 pence 7.1875. At the time, spot US exchange was difficult to settle and sell at 7.84375 yuan. Later, Hong Kong cables stopped selling, and the yarn and cotton trading firms saw the opportunity to buy in, and it was rumored that Hong Kong speculators also came to buy February futures, so the market once returned to flat. Ultimately, Hong Kong cables came to sell again, and some banks also had strong selling intentions, and the rates eased again. Hong Kong cables sold spot US exchange to foreign banks at 7.875 yuan, and British gold also rose to 4 pence 7.34375. There was even less trading at noon, and the situation was flat. Until the noon close, there were no changes. British gold was still at 4 pence 7.064375, and US exchange was still at 7.875 yuan. Next month's futures for British gold was at 4 pence 6.875.

<h3 id="e101">Tianjin Group Sells Off: Gold Market Downturn Intensifies <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the unofficial market for spot gold continued to decline, and the downturn intensified. The reason is that the environment is poor, and the exchange market is easing, coupled with the Tianjin group selling off, which further exacerbated the situation. Although the Hong Kong group still had an appetite for buying, some banks continued to sell off old stock on behalf of customers, so the balance of supply and demand was naturally difficult to maintain. As a result, the price fell by as much as 39 yuan. The morning opening immediately fell by 9 yuan to 4,109 yuan. The reason was that the securities group was the first to sell off. Later, some money exchange firms came in to buy, pulling the price up by 4 yuan. However, with reports of an easing exchange market, sentiment became even more discouraged, with everyone selling. The securities group and some banks were the most aggressive in selling. Although the Hong Kong group made a concerted effort and commissioned some money exchange firms to absorb some of the stock, they ultimately felt they had sufficient funds, so the price fell to a low of 4,075 yuan. Before the close, the selling eased slightly, and the price rebounded slightly, closing at 4,079 yuan at noon. There was no market in the afternoon, and the underlying trend was flat, with little change from the noon closing price. Trading was brisk for half a day, with approximately 1,300 taels traded. Jewelry gold and customs gold remained flat.</p>
<p>Spot Gold Down 39 Yuan</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the morning, sentiment remained discouraged. Some securities groups first came to lower prices and sell off, causing the opening price to immediately fall by 9 yuan. The securities group sold 10 taels of gold at 4,109 yuan. Shortly after, some money exchange firms suddenly came to absorb the stock, and the price rose by 4 yuan. The money exchange firms bought 20 taels of gold from some banks at 4,113 yuan. Subsequently, because the exchange market eased slightly, some banks and jewelry groups collectively sold off, and soon broke through the 4,100 yuan mark. The gold firms sold 10 taels to the money exchange firms at 4,095 yuan. At that time, some jewelry shops bought on behalf of customers, and the exchange rate stabilized, there were fewer sellers, and the price rebounded again. The spot gold firms bought 50 taels from the securities groups at 4,108 yuan. Unexpectedly, the selling pressure intensified, and some banks forcefully sold off on behalf of customers. At the same time, some securities groups also aggressively sold off on behalf of customers, and retail investors also saw the situation and sold off, so the downtrend became more severe, plummeting by 33 yuan. The securities groups sold 10 taels to the money exchange firms at 4,075 yuan. Then, the selling eased slightly, and the money exchange firms took advantage of the low price to buy in, immediately rebounding by 9 yuan. The money exchange firms bought 10 taels from the gold firms at 4,084 yuan. Finally, the jewelry groups came to sell off again, and the price dropped again by 5 yuan. The gold firms traded 20 taels among themselves, closing at 4,079 yuan at noon. As a result, the price fell by another 39 yuan compared to the previous day. There was a fluctuation of 38 yuan for half a day. The selling price of the spot gold firms' own brand of gold was several yuan higher than spot gold, and the buying price was reduced by 20 yuan. The current standard gold price was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price, and there were few transactions.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Prices Remain the Same</p>
<p>The selling price of jewelry gold remained unchanged throughout the day. Datonghang still offered 415 yuan, and the prices of Xinhanghang were the same as the previous price, with the purchase price reduced by about 15 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday, foreign currencies weakened further. There was very little demand for British and American gold pounds, and market prices were weak. Gold notes were all trending towards excess supply. In the early morning, the price of US gold notes fell to 12.56 yuan, but rebounded in the noon market to 10.6 yuan. The market situation stabilized in the afternoon and did not change. Singapore and Dutch notes were very scarce in demand. The supply of Annam and Robbie notes increased, and prices all declined. Canada and Philippine notes also followed and softened. Japanese gold notes had little change, with an evening price of 1.261 yuan. Korean notes had an evening price of 1.03 yuan. Yesterday's market prices: British and American gold pounds all decreased by 1 yuan. British and American gold notes and Canadian notes all decreased by 10 cents. Singapore, Dutch, Robbie, and Philippine notes all decreased by 5 cents. Annam notes decreased by 2 cents. Other currencies remained unchanged.</p>
<h3 id="e103">Discount Rate at 24 Yuan <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the discount rate for bills of exchange was around 24 yuan per thousand yuan per day, which was 2.5 cents lower than the previous day. The Shanghai Money Trade Association's interbank lending rate was suddenly reduced by 2 cents, with both morning and noon markets at 1 cent.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Securities: Domestic Bonds Improve; Foreign Stocks Remain Firm <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>The unofficial market for securities saw increased confidence yesterday. Because after the US-Japan trade treaty expired, regardless of whether incidents gradually trend towards conciliation, there are not many days left in the year. Most people are preparing to save and store to earn the interest and bonus dividend profits that are due, so the amount being supplied for sale is becoming less and less. Market prices are stable and popular as a result. Yesterday's market saw fewer transactions in the morning. Jiufu and Hengfu had some buying, and retail investors slightly covered their short positions. Jiufeng and Gengxinghao had some selling. Market prices showed a trend of wavering. In the afternoon, news improved, and transactions also slightly improved. Class C bonds once broke through the 1 yuan mark. Class A bonds once saw a high price of 3 yuan, but because No. 41 bonds were released, the price slightly fell back. As a result, except for Class D bonds, which fell by 10 cents, the rest all rose by 5 cents, 10 cents to 30 cents. The total transaction volume was approximately 600,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below:</p>
<p>Category High Low Closing Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>Unified Class A 63.00 62.75 62.95 Up 0.30</p>

<p>Stock transactions: 60 shares of Tianchu MSG factory were traded at a price of 80 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday's stock market at the Public Trading Hall also showed underlying strength. Industrial stocks and rubber stocks both increased. Shanghai Bank shares traded at 18.3 yuan, International Trust shares at 15 yuan, and Yangzi Bank shares at 13 yuan. Stocks of Ruirong, Jardine Spinning Mill, and Steel Industry were particularly strong, with prices mutually advancing. Among rubber stocks, English Zha Hua, Zhi Mo, Lange, Xue Na Wang, and Di Bang were in high demand, with considerable transaction volume.</p>
<p>London, 26th Telegram: Today, the listed prices of stocks of British companies in the Far East only saw an increase of 5 shillings for Mercantile Bank shares, priced at 8 pounds 17 shillings and 6 pence. The rest were unchanged.</p>
<p>London, 26th Telegram: Today, the listed prices of Chinese foreign bonds remained relatively stable, with no changes in upper and lower tier bonds.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Yarn and Cotton: Futures Trading Picks Up; Yarn Prices Rise <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market rose slightly, but the actual situation did not show much progress. In addition to Cantonese merchants still making sporadic purchases of 42s, 32s, and 23s yarn, other merchants showed no lively activity. There was some trading of coarse yarn in North China. However, foreign firms do not manufacture this cotton yarn. The general public with some financial flexibility are still not bearish on the yarn market, and are slowly entering into market activities, so the market looks to be rising again. However, according to people in the industry, cotton yarn inventory has 300,000 bales in the inventory, and the Zhe Dong battles are intensifying and shipping is restricted, part of the cotton yarn has already been returned to Shanghai.</p>
<p>In the morning, current yarn prices opened with mediocre materials, and the situation in the market was still peaceful. 20s Double Horse opened at a price of 733 yuan. Then, some firms bought several hundred bales of futures, and sentiment suddenly changed, and the supply suddenly tightened. However, foreign exchange was stable and did not change, and the yarn market slowly rose. 20s Double Horse closed at 738 yuan. Statistics on transactions for half a day totaled 1,635 bales. The market increased 4 yuan for 20s Double Horse and 2 yuan for Tian Nu. The factory Shan Zhen Hua Factory released 500 bales of 10s Double Dragon, priced at 550 yuan. Yong An Factory released 30 bales of 20s Te Jin Cheng, priced at 732 yuan, and 95 bales of 16s Te Jin Cheng, priced at 590 yuan. The amount purchased by each group is listed on the left:</p>
<p>Fellow Traders: 1,170 Hong Kong: 350 Ningbo: 10</p>

<p>Raw cotton trading is still able to maintain itself, and the factories' demand remains stagnant. This is because yarn sales are not good, and the state of foreign cotton is weak, so the situation is also wavering. In addition, the end of the year is approaching day by day, and most businesses are closing. As a result, business is not smooth. The sources of cotton from Northern Jiangsu include 2,102 bales of Tong cotton. The current raw cotton transaction situation is listed on the left:</p>
<p>Brazilian cotton 210.00 Bought by fellow traders 105 pieces</p>
<p>Also 229.00 Also 212 pieces</p>
<p>Also 232.00 Also 100 pieces</p>
<p>Fire grass bales 159.00 Also 60 bales</p>
<p>Also 159.75 Also 225 bales</p>
<p>Also 156.25 Also 230 bales</p>
<p>Tong Cotton 180.00 United Factory buys 300 bales</p>
<p>Another report: Foreign cotton market prices: The New York cotton market slightly decreased in the early morning due to selling in the south. Later, due to industry purchases and purchases on Wall Street, the closing market was quite firm. As a result, cotton prices increased by 5 to 6 pounds. The Indian cotton market was closed for one day yesterday. Prices forecast to be unchanged. Egypt was also closed for one day yesterday. Liverpool decreased 7 to 8 pence.</p>
<p>Transactions in foreign cotton in Shanghai have been quiet recently because the end of the year is approaching, and all firms are preparing to close their accounts. The factories currently have no urgent purchases. The factories of the Japanese firms have been quiet for a long time. It is generally expected that after the end of the year, foreign cotton trading will become more active. The following are the factory prices of the cotton market yesterday, converted to pounds at a US exchange rate of 7.75:</p>
<p>20s American Medium Grade 225.90</p>
<p>Also the same, Lower grade 222.30</p>

<p>Yesterday's soybean oil market saw the company (an oil regulation mechanism set up in the center) release a batch of large, quick crude oil at 101 yuan at the end of the previous day's market. The amount was insufficient for distribution at that time, so the transaction was not completed. It was properly delivered yesterday morning, totaling 550 barrels, so market sentiment was temporarily suppressed. There was little buying or selling from others. The underlying trend is still in a firm situation. Qingdao oil has virtually stopped, and both basket-packed oil and stored oil are lacking, so the future is still hopeful. For peanut oil, only 120 pieces of Jiaozhou basket oil were properly sold on the street yesterday, priced at 81 yuan, a continuation of the previous market's increase of one yuan. In addition, 170 pieces of soybean oil came from Tianjin yesterday, and 1,000 pieces of soybean cake came from Yantai. 693 cans of tung oil also came from Tianjin.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Piece Goods: Dong Goods Fine Cloth and Fine Twill; White Again Sees Price Increase; More Local Sales of Spot Goods <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth market saw Dong goods supported by steady buying from the Tianjin currency group. Each piece of white fine cloth and fine twill increased by 20 to 35 cents. Spot goods of Dragon Head fine cloth were priced at 22.7 yuan, and futures were particularly popular. Each foreign firm ordered over 1,000 pieces of fine cloth. The Dragon Head in February had already been sold at 23.25 yuan, March was at 23.6 yuan, Rainbow Ball was at 23.25 yuan, and Loudspeaker was at 23 yuan. The Tianjin group's purchases mostly focused on futures, with nearly 1,000 pieces of fine cloth and fine twill traded. Most of the 700 to 800 pieces purchased by local traders and dyeing factories were spot goods. The market atmosphere was very firm.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Wool and Cloth Lacking Spot Goods and Hoarding <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>The wool and cloth market saw actual sales were idle, but traders were actively searching for hot items to trade. There were very few standard wholesale prices, because of the lack of spot goods, there was hoarding, causing most holders of goods to raise prices. Because most of the current goods are popular and rare, even with cash, it is difficult to buy in large quantities, so most sellers are unwilling to sell their stock during the closing period, waiting for better prices next spring.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Hardware: Large Tinplate: Actual Sales Begin <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>The tinplate market was slightly active yesterday, with local yarn factories, rolling cylinder factories, and small hardware stores making some purchases. The number of 24 gauge goods was very small, while there were more than 20 boxes of 26 gauge goods. Standard market prices have also improved. Because the stock of 24 gauge is strangely dry, prices remain high, still selling for around 900 yuan per box. The 26 gauge goods can be divided into British and Italian goods and American goods. British and Italian goods sold for 380 yuan for each box containing 50 sheets, while American goods sold for 420 yuan for each box containing 56 sheets.</p>

<p>Raw silk is the raw material for book staples. Recently, because actual sales of book staples were not widespread, and the market stock was abundant, market prices have not been firm. Prices continue to hover between 47 and 48 yuan. Transactions were limited to door shops and fellow traders. Construction workers also sometimes made purchases, but the number was not as strong as in the past. Raw silk business is stagnant, and the only reliance of raw silk is the staple factory, but the factory has scarce demand, the market situation is exceptionally quiet, the standard market price is around 42 or 43 yuan.</p>

<p>Recently, the market for black dates has turned stable because buyers are unwilling to sell too cheaply. Among ordinary supplements, this item is the most affordable, and the current market, such as Gao Tong Shou, is priced at 35 to 36 yuan, which is quite appealing to speculators. There is a possibility of a turnaround in the future market.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Statistics: Price Changes - December 28th Year (1) <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>There were a total of 29 price increases in December, which is 11 more than in November. Analyzing the types of goods with price increases, food and drink items accounted for the most, with 10 cases. Next were medicine, printing, cultural products, etc. Looking at the 29 price-increasing industrial and commercial units, there were 42 companies involved.</p>
<p>The trend of price increases in December has clearly seen its decline, because foreign exchange is gradually easing, and goods from various places to Shanghai, especially European goods, continue to arrive in a steady stream. And domestic regions continue to deliver like the past several months. Therefore, the trend of price increases is inevitable, but sadly they will continue. Besides, all prices have risen to their peak. Calculating and comparing the real costs, the difference is huge. Huge profits are available, so there is no room to increase prices again. Now, the price increases in December are explained as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Local wine, the large bottle increases by 10 cents per bottle, medium bottle increases by 5 cents, whole Gold Fragrance wine large bottle increases by 40 cents per dozen, medium bottle increases by 24 cents (China Company)</p>

<h3 id="e114">The Intertwined Relations of the Axis Powers, The Cunning Diplomacy of Italy: Adopting an Armed but Peaceful Policy <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>The Establishment and Division of the Axis</p>
<p>The Black Shirt Prime Minister Mussolini, standing outside the vortex of war, seems to have recently become a dispensable supporting character on the European political stage. Apart from the occasional relatively loud pronouncements from his mouthpiece, "Il Popolo d'Italia," he has not been seen making any startling moves for a long time. Everyone is asking: Is Italy going to spend this European crisis in a semi-dormant state forever? Otherwise, which path will Italy take? Reconciling with Germany or befriending Britain and France? Judging from Mussolini's diplomatic actions since the outbreak of the Second European War, his diplomacy can be described as cunning, leaving no trace. It would be incorrect to say that he is attached to the former other axis—Germany, and it is fundamentally not the case that he opposes Germany and helps Britain and France. Looking at Italian diplomacy from a few years ago, it is true that Italy was allied with Germany, unanimously opposing Britain and France. However, the alliance between the two Axis countries in Europe was a temporary mutual exploitation, not a permanent partnership. Italy's basic policy was to gain hegemony in Central Europe. Therefore, she would rather see the small countries that split from the former Austro-Hungarian Empire remain in a state of chaos and opposition, so that she could pull the strings from behind, sometimes uniting A to control B, and sometimes uniting B to control A, rather than see the powerful Germany extend its influence to the Brenner Pass on Italy's border. However, Mussolini wanted to transform the Kingdom of Italy into the Italian Empire and turn the Mediterranean into "Our Sea," so he mobilized troops and invaded Abyssinia. The Italian Empire was created, but Italy became isolated internationally. Therefore, out of desperation, he found Hitler and established the Axis. It is said that the formation of this Axis concept was due to the suggestion of his beloved daughter Edda, and it was promoted by his beloved son-in-law Ciano. Edda Ciano personally visited Berlin to meet with key figures of the German National Socialist Party to sign this treaty in the past. As a result, although the Berlin-Rome Axis was established, the price paid by Italy was not small. In March 1938, Mussolini watched helplessly as Hitler snatched Austria from his hands. Six months later, he helped his partner invade Czechoslovakia in the Munich Agreement, and he still gained nothing. In March 1939, after Hitler devoured Czechoslovakia and grabbed Memel, Italy took Albania into its hands, and Italy finally tasted a little sweetness. After Hitler went through several annexations without encountering obstacles, his appetite grew. Finally, he put the butcher's knife on Poland's head, and Mussolini warned him that this time it couldn't be done, and any further moves would cause war. However, Hitler did not accept his warning, and the war broke out as expected. After the war broke out, Mussolini did not fulfill the obligations of the German-Italian military alliance, and the Berlin-Rome Axis came to an end.</p>
<p>Italy's New Strategy</p>
<p>Although Italy did not fulfill the obligations stipulated in the military alliance with Germany, Ciano still declared his efforts to support Germany until recently, which means that the relationship between Germany and Italy is still intertwined. It can be seen that Italy's non-participation in the war does not mean helping Britain and France. On the contrary, her method is a good strategy to coerce Britain and France. As mentioned above, although Italy has transformed the kingdom into an empire, the attempt to turn the Mediterranean into "Our Sea" has not yet been realized. Therefore, Italy has not forgotten to obtain African colonies from Britain and France. Fascist spokesman Gayda has pointed out that "Italy expects a solution to the colonial issue. Italy hopes for a free and equal solution to the colonial issue based on the intention of the Treaty of Versailles... Therefore, Mussolini has adopted an armed but peaceful policy..." This open declaration revealed Italy's heartfelt wishes, which means that Italy is not satisfied with gaining hegemony in Central Europe and must obtain colonies before it is finished. This is the reason why Italy expresses goodwill to both sides and makes demands for benefits from both sides.</p>

<p>— Ju</p>
<p>Speaking of Sven Hedin, I think everyone has not forgotten that he is an explorer from Sweden. He surveyed production in northwestern China a few years ago, and his name was often mentioned in the newspapers. Recently, he presented his peace plan to Hitler in Berlin, Germany. According to what he said to people:</p>
<p>"The sole purpose of my peace proposal is to save culture and civilization. These will surely be destroyed in a long war."</p>
<p>"My hope is to go to London immediately to offer my plan to Chamberlain and other government officials, or even King George, if possible."</p>
<p>"However, estimating the current situation, I have to temporarily abandon this idea, because the hope of success is very small. However, the peace plan has been sent, and I hope it can be published in the UK."</p>
<p>It is said that his peace plan was developed after seeing Hitler. He appealed to the Netherlands and Belgium, believing that although there is no hope of success at present, unremitting efforts will surely achieve the goal.</p>
<p>It has been found that Sven Hedin has not been to the UK since before the last war. During the war, he was a skilled propagandist who helped Germany and opposed Britain. Now he is anti-Bolshevik, hoping that Germany and Britain will unite against Russia.</p>

<p>In the vicinity of Boledo'na in Argentina, there is a unique city in the world called "Hope City". The residents who live in this city are all unemployed people in the past. Because they could not get relief, they came to the riverbank, built many small houses, and lived a collective life.</p>
<p>Each of them gathered their previous savings and bought mules and horses, etc. Each person took turns in groups to go to the market to trade and exchange various foods. Sometimes they caught birds and animals to use as side dishes, and they planted many beautiful flowers and plants near their houses, and took them to the market every day to sell to the ladies.</p>
<p>In this city, there is a very interesting rule, that is, the residents who live in this city are not allowed to marry wives, so as to avoid the trouble of arguing with their wives, and most of the residents here abide by this rule.</p>
<p>Their solidarity is very good. There are no mutual fights at ordinary times, and they will not do things that violate national laws, so this city does not need prosperity to maintain order.</p>

<p>— Ke</p>
<p>South Africa has always been the place with the highest gold production in the world, followed by Canada and the United States. However, according to recent reports from the Soviet Union, the country's gold production in recent years has exceeded that of the United States and Canada, and ranks second in the world. If we consider the total output of the world, although the output of Canada and South Africa has decreased year by year, the sharp increase in the output of the Soviet Union has resulted in a stable increase. Judging from the situation in the past two years, the total amount in 1939 exceeded 140,514 ounces in 1938, of which the number from the Soviet Union was estimated by Washington, and the actual number is more than this. The gold production of the world's major gold-producing countries and the world's total amount from 1938 to 1939 are listed on the left in ounces:</p>
<p>1938 1939</p>
<p>Worldwide 14,486 24,282,000</p>

<h3 id="e120">Why? <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>— Yiyi Guan Zhu</p>
<p>The three words "Why" can increase your knowledge. As long as you are not afraid to ask, do not be ashamed to ask, and always remember to use these three words "Why" to seek explanations for your doubts.</p>
<p>For example: When you do arithmetic, whether it is addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, as well as geometry; trigonometry; algebra and other arithmetic problems, there must be places that make you doubt, then you should use the three words "Why" to ask your teachers or parents. "Why" do you calculate like this, "Why" do you use this formula? For example: "Why" do electric lights light up? "Why" do telephones transmit messages? "Why" does radio broadcast? "Why" does an airplane fly? If you can often use the three words "Why" to ask your teachers or parents about such questions, you can get a lot of knowledge.</p>
<p>Because, when we think about the two words "Knowledge", we know that "learning" and "asking" are closely related. In other words, anything that you learn will have questions. To explain the questions, you must ask questions well. "Why" is it like this? "Why" is it like that? If you only know "learning" but do not know "asking", you will not only not get the benefits of "learning", but also waste time and energy. This is the most foolish thing!</p>
<p>In short, "Learning has no end". I hope that all of you dear children, whether in school, at home, or in society, will not be afraid to ask, do not be ashamed to ask, and use the three words "Why" to seek answers to questions anytime, anywhere for everything you are doubtful and do not understand. Then I think your knowledge must be advancing day by day without limit.</p>
<h3 id="e121">The Story of Yue Fei's Poverty <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Xishen</p>
<p>Dear children: There is an ancient saying that goes: "Poverty cannot be moved". It means that even when a person is in poverty and hardship, he cannot lose his ambition because of this, and he must still maintain his integrity. This is indeed not an easy thing! Now I will tell you a story of "Poverty cannot be moved"; that person is the great man in Chinese history, the famous general of the Song Dynasty, Yue Fei. It is said that before Yue Fei became a marshal, he once snatched the Little Prince Liang in Bianjing (now Kaifeng, Henan) and made a big disturbance at the martial arts field. Then he temporarily stayed at home idly. That year happened to be a drought and famine, and rice and grain were expensive. Yue Fei's family of several people inevitably had a difficult time. A group of sworn brothers went out to rob because they could not endure poverty. But Yue Fei was very ambitious. He would rather be poor than do illegal things. Therefore, not only did he not participate, but he also broke off relations with his brothers because he advised them and they did not wake up, and his family of several people lived a poor life.</p>
<p>Later, the bandit leader Yang Yao on Dongting Lake knew that Yue Fei was very capable and in a state of poverty, so he sent Wang Zuo to bring a lot of gold and silver to invite Yue Fei to be the "Grand Marshal". At first, Wang Zuo did not tell the truth. Later, when Yue Fei understood that he was sent by Yang Yao, he immediately returned the gold and silver treasures as they were, and said to him: "I, Yue Fei, am a person of the Song Dynasty, and I will be a ghost of the Song Dynasty after I die. How can I betray the country and surrender to the bandits, and do things that are unfaithful and unrighteous? Please go back and tell your king that he should never think of me, Yue Fei, surrendering to him in this life." Wang Zuo saw that Yue Fei's attitude was very firm, so he had to take the gold and silver and left very boringly.</p>
<p>Dear children, although Yue Fei was in poverty, he not only did not have any extravagant thoughts, but also gold and silver treasures could not move his heart. Such noble character is so worthy of our admiration! Later, he eventually became the Grand Marshal of the Song Dynasty!</p>
<h3 id="e122">Scientific Little Game <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>— Su Ming</p>
<p>Yong'er's school has been on winter vacation for many days. Every morning, he always does his work according to his self-set timetable - writing, reading... A whole morning passes quickly. After eating lunch, he is idle and has nothing to do, so he goes out to play, but in the past few days, the outdoor climate has been quite terrible.</p>
<p>"Brother, it's really cold outside. It's boring to hide at home. Are there any fun things for everyone to play?" Yong'er asked his brother Zong'er like this.</p>
<p>"What is there not? And this game is very simple. We almost all play it every day, but everyone has not noticed it. You go think about it first. If you can't guess, I will tell you." Zong'er laughed and said after hearing what his younger brother asked, thought carefully.</p>
<p>"Then I definitely can't guess it. Tell me quickly, don't be a tease, tell me!"</p>
<p>"If you don't even think about it, how can you say you can't guess it? Don't be lazy all the time, and don't use your brain power. You must know that using your brain power more can also train this good habit, and you will feel that it has great use in the future." Zong'er saw that Yong'er was so anxious, so he teased him even more. So Xi'er was silent for a while, and of course he would not guess it.</p>
<p>Zong'er then took a chair and asked Yong'er to sit down, and made his trunk straighten, and his two feet flat on the ground. Yong'er was confused and did what his brother said. What kind of game is this? When he heard his brother say half a sentence of "stand up...", he easily tilted his body and stood up. What's so fun about this?</p>
<p>But his brother said: "No, no, my words are not finished yet. Sit down again and listen to what I say; you are not allowed to tilt your body, and you are not allowed to move your feet. Try to stand up." After he finished speaking, he prevented his younger brother's body from tilting. And Yong'er thought it was easy, so he wanted to stand up, but in fact, he straightened his body but still couldn't stand up. What is the reason for this?</p>
<p>"This is a matter of the center of gravity of an object. The reason why people who stand up do not fall down is because the vertical line controlled by their center of gravity passes through the inside of our body invisibly, so they will not fall down. If the vertical line leaves our body, we will fall down. And you, the person sitting, your center of gravity is inside the body, close to the place of the spine. The vertical line starting from this point passes through the chair and behind the heels. If you want to stand up, you should move this straight county to the middle of the two feet. Therefore, lean your body forward and move the center of gravity, or move your feet back. This is our usual habit of getting up from a chair. The vertical line is what we imagine to explain this problem. If you don't tilt your body, you will never be able to stand up. Isn't this game very simple? But we have never thought of it."</p>
<h3 id="e123">Student Observation Meeting <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>— Long Jusheng</p>
<p>Children, another semester has ended in the bloodshed of the national struggle. These days, everyone is eating, drinking, playing, and traveling during the happy holidays. Most of the children have left their homework behind. Children! You must remember that in extraordinary times, under high prices, it is not easy for your parents and brothers to cultivate you!</p>
<p>I would like to contribute to the children how to use the winter vacation. That is to hold a "Student Observation Meeting". Invite your classmates to gather together and discuss the schoolwork together. Review the Chinese, English, arithmetic, civics, common sense, etc., and be sure to read more, see more, and write more. As the ancient saying goes, "Studying alone without friends is to be ignorant and uninformed." It also says: "Meet friends with literature, and help benevolence with friends." The stones of other mountains can attack jade. Even the most holy teacher, Confucius, said: "When three people walk together, there must be my teacher." He consulted Tanzi about "official names", visited "Chang Hong" for "music", learned the qin from Shi Xiang, and asked Laozi about "Zhou Li". He was so tireless in learning. You should follow his example. Han Yu of the Tang Dynasty also said: "...Therefore, disciples do not have to be inferior to teachers, and teachers do not have to be wiser than disciples. There is a priority in hearing the Tao, and there is a specialization in art, that's all..." Children, remember! Among the classmates, there are smart ones and stupid ones, there are stupid ones who know how to study hard, and there are smart ones who are absurd. Then, in the observation meeting, you can encourage each other, instruct each other, abandon the idea of playing games, and bury yourself in books. Not only read books to death, but also cite living materials and living experiments, so that the homework can make progress. The author's childhood practice of reading books to death, reading books to death, now I think it is a great mistake!</p>

<p>— Yimu</p>
<p>The old gentleman replied angrily: What do you want from me? Humph, I want a lot! I want to warm myself by the fire, and a place to live; and there is a big fire burning in your stove, crackling, making the walls red, but no one except you comes to enjoy it. Come, little friend, let me in quickly; I want to come in and warm myself by the fire."</p>
<p>At this time, Gle was stretching his neck, looking out of the window, feeling a burst of cold air blowing on his face, and he hurried to shrink his head and return to the window. Sure enough, he saw that the fire in the stove was crackling, and the firelight was very beautiful. The fire tongue looked as if it smelled the fragrance of mutton, and it stretched long towards the chimney. Gle thought that such a good fire, but no one came to warm themselves by it, which was a pity. So his heart suddenly softened, and he said to himself: "The old man's body must be very wet from the rain. I'd better let him come in and sit for a while." Then he hurried to the door and opened it. The old gentleman hurried into the exhibition room, and a gust of wind followed in, blowing sparks from the chimney.</p>
<p>The old gentleman said to Gle: "You are really a good child, don't worry about your two brothers making things difficult for you. When they come back, let me explain it to them." Gle read: "Sir, please don't bother. Even if I allow you to stay here, I won't be able to wait for them to come back, because they will beat me to death if they see me letting outsiders in." The old gentleman said: "Oh, I feel very sad when I hear you say that. But how long can you allow me to stay?" Gle said: "Sir, wait until I smoke this piece of mutton and turn the whole piece brown."</p>
<p>The old gentleman walked into the kitchen and sat down by the stove. The tip of his hat still touched the ceiling. Gle still sat down and smoked the mutton, turning the iron grate non-stop, and said to the old gentleman: "Sir, your clothes will be dry in a while." But the old gentleman did not take off his coat to dry it, but let the water on the coat drip onto the charcoal in the stove, making the fire sway and make popping noises non-stop. But some of the water dripped into the stove, and some flowed on the floor like ditch water, as if it had turned into a small stream. Gle saw this situation and hurriedly said: "Sir, I'm sorry, can you take off your coat and give it to me?" The old gentleman replied: "No need, thank you." Gle asked again: "Sir, what about your hat?" The old gentleman replied again: "No need, thank you." Gle said hesitantly: "Sir, I'm very sorry, but the water on your body is about to extinguish my fire." The old gentleman said coldly: "Then your mutton can be smoked for a longer time."</p>
<p>Gle looked at the old gentleman's behavior, which was cold and strange, and he was very surprised in his heart. After being silent for a while, the old man said again: "Your mutton looks very good, can you give me some to eat?" Gle said anxiously: "That's impossible, sir." The old gentleman said again: "I'm really very hungry. I didn't eat anything yesterday, and I haven't eaten anything today. Can't you cut off a little bit from the side of the trotter?" Gle heard the voice was very miserable, and his heart softened again, and said: "Sir, my two brothers have allowed me to eat a small piece today, so I will let you eat it. But there is only this small piece, and no more."</p>

<h3 id="e126">On the Art of Oral Mimicry (Part 2) <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>— Junmei</p>
<p>During the Kangxi reign of the Qing dynasty, there was a master of oral mimicry in the capital whose art was especially outstanding. He didn't limit himself to one subject during his performances, but his portrayals of trivial domestic affairs were particularly lifelike. Once, he performed his art at a banquet hosted by a certain prince. It began with the distant sound of a dog barking, followed by a woman startled awake, nudging her husband, speaking of intimate matters. The husband mumbled in his sleep, and the wife continued to nudge him. Then, a child woke up and cried loudly. The husband told the wife to nurse the child, and the child cried while suckling. The husband got up to urinate, and the wife also held the child up to urinate. A bigger child in the bed awoke. At that moment, the sounds of the wife patting the child, the "woo-woo" sounds from her mouth, the child crying while suckling, the older child's initial cries upon waking, the rustling of the bed curtains, the husband's scolding, and the sound of urination all erupted together. All the sounds were complete and vivid. All the guests at the banquet craned their necks and turned their heads, considering it marvelously unique. After a while, the husband went back to bed to sleep, and then called out to the older child to finish urinating. The younger child gradually fell asleep, and the wife gradually stopped patting the child. Soon, loud snoring filled the air. Suddenly, a person shouted that a fire had started. The husband, hearing the shout, woke up in alarm and shouted. The wife also got up and shouted. Both children cried in unison. The neighbors also shouted. Then, the sounds of hundreds of children crying and hundreds of dogs barking, the sounds of things collapsing and falling, the sounds of explosions, the howling of the wind, the shouts for help, the sounds of houses creaking, and the sounds of people looting and splashing water all rose together in a myriad of sounds, as if Zhurong (the god of fire) was wreaking havoc. At this, all the guests changed color and left their seats, flailing their sleeves and waving their arms, their legs trembling, wanting to be the first to flee. Suddenly, with the sound of a striking of a ruler, all the sounds ceased. The guests, who were initially panicked, looked around, and there was only one person, one table, one chair, one fan, and one ruler. Everyone couldn't help but smile in amazement at his skill.</p>
<p>As for those who were known for their sound imitation in historical records, there was the Dog-Skin Taoist of the late Ming Dynasty, whose imitation of dog barking was extremely realistic. He begged for food in the Chengdu marketplace. At the time, Zhang Xianzhong was invading. The Taoist suddenly appeared dozens of steps in front of Zhang Xianzhong's horse, barking loudly like a dog, and then fled. On New Year's Day, when Zhang Xianzhong was receiving his officials, the Taoist, unnoticed, slipped into the ranks while the officials were ascending the steps to pay their respects. He held a court tablet like the others and suddenly barked like a dog. Zhang Xianzhong was furious and ordered him to be bound. The Taoist then barked even louder, filling the courtyard with sounds like hundreds of dogs fighting, the sound reaching far and wide. All the dogs in the city, hearing the sound, joined in, and the barking shook the heavens and the earth. Zhang Xianzhong shouted loudly, but no one could hear him because the dog barking was so loud. So, he hastily retreated, and the Taoist took the opportunity to escape. There was also a person called Xiaoweng who was skilled and could imitate the sounds of the luan bird, the crane, the phoenix, and the wind. Every time he made a sound, hundreds of birds would gather and chickens and ducks would dance. When he imitated the roar of an old dragon, he would lie drunk on the banks of the great river and roar a few times. Fish and shrimp would break the waves and come to the shore, and turtles would often greet the waves with bows. Today, there are also people in amusement parks who sell their skills in oral mimicry, but they can only imitate and mimic, and their skill is far removed from what was once known as oral mimicry.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Movies and Family Life <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>— Xinying</p>
<p>Everyone knows that movies are not just a tool for pure entertainment. In addition to entertainment, they also contain educational significance, and the power of suggestion they possess is greater than any other educational tool. Therefore, a film about family issues can affect the transformation of many families. A story of family revolution, filmed on the silver screen, can make some young people who are dissatisfied with family oppression especially hostile to their parents, wishing they could run away. Similarly, a story full of a sweet family, filmed on the silver screen, can make some couples who disagree reconcile. The depth of feeling that movies can evoke is evident.</p>
<p>Recently, a Hollywood film, after being shown in Shanghai, deeply impressed a Shanghainese man. He immediately returned home and reunited with his wife and children, starting a new life. Because a year before, he had an affair with another woman, and the couple often quarreled, and he finally left home. This film was "Intermezzo," shown at the Cathay Cinema, a love story discussing family issues, depicting a father who has a relationship with another woman, causing discord in the family. Everything shown in the film particularly caught the attention of that Shanghainese man, as if his entire life had been filmed on the silver screen.</p>
<p>His emotions were uncontrollable. He admired the cleverness of the Hollywood screenwriter. He had left his wife and children and was living alone outside. However, after being away for two days, he went to the Cathay to see "Intermezzo," which resulted in a fierce conflict in his mind, and he finally decided to return home. Because in the story of the film, although the young woman fell in love with the father, she realized that the wife and children at home would suffer greatly after the father left, so she decided to sacrifice herself, allowing him to return to a harmonious marital life.</p>

<p>The famous female Peking Opera performer Ms. Wu Jilan, the adopted daughter of the late celebrity Linwu Shanren, has the honor of being the "Number One Female Dan in the South" since descending to the professional stage. Last year, Ms. Wu returned to Shanghai with honors from Yunnan, and has been resting in Shanghai, teaching painting and calligraphy. In addition to teaching at the Shanghai Public Women's Night School, she has also studied painting and calligraphy with the old celebrity Shen Zhongxian, aspiring to permanently retire from the opera stage and devote herself to painting and calligraphy as a lifelong career upon completion of her studies.</p>

<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>Liu Gansan's Two Donkeys Escorting a Funeral</p>
<p>It is said that "everything has its owner," and the loyalty of animals to their masters is as faithful as that of subjects to their rulers in feudal times. The comedian veteran Liu Gansan kept a donkey that was exceptionally intelligent and docile. Every time Liu performed "Visiting Relatives and Scolding," he would ride it onto the stage. This donkey, trained by Gansan, could understand its master's words and intentions. When performing in the inner court, Gansan would lead the donkey to the edge of the stage and say to it, "The Holy Presence of the Old Buddha is here, why don't you kneel down and kowtow!" The donkey would immediately bend its front knees to the ground and kowtow repeatedly towards the palace. The Empress Dowager Cixi was greatly amused and sometimes even bestowed rewards, and later even provided monthly rations. Although emperors have granted ministers the honor of riding imperial horses, none have ever allowed a donkey to tread in the inner palace and receive rewards from the emperor and empress like this one. Gansan's ugly woman role can be said to be unique in ancient and modern times, and his most popular Caidan (female comic role) play was "Visiting Relatives," where he rode a real donkey onto the stage to perform various acts, which was especially sensational in the capital. It is said that Gansan personally fed the donkey all its food. Liu would also rely on it for transportation, and whenever he reached his destination, Liu would get off the donkey and go straight into the house, leaving the donkey outside, without needing to tie it to a post or have someone guard it. If strangers tried to mount the donkey or steal it, the donkey would roar and jump, and the thieves would not be able to get close. However, as soon as it saw Liu, it would become docile as usual. In front of an old photo studio on Langfang Street outside Qianmen in Beiping, in the early years of the Republic of China, hung more than ten portraits of famous actors from the Tongzhi and Guangxu eras, painted with meticulous brushwork, each person depicted vividly, and the colors were also bright and even. Cheng Changgeng, Xu Xiaoxiang, Lu Shengkui, Yu Sansheng, Mei Qiaoling, Liu Gansan, and others were among them, and they were known as the "Thirteen Unrivaled Performers." These thirteen people were all talented in their respective roles of Sheng (male), Dan (female), Jing (painted-face male), and Chou (comic) at that time. (178)</p>
