<h3 id="c18">民族問題在今日的國際 <a href="#c18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>歐戰前途的演變尙在未定之天，國際間的民族離合又見新的萌動；遠東的印度緬甸都有獨立運動，方在醖釀；法國境內的勃萊頓民族，經過四百年的靜止，也突於法國戰敗之後發生組織民族國家的企圖。另一方面，前次歐戰後甫以民族自決方式獲得獨立的波羅的海三小國，則以自動請求的方式取消獨立併入蘇聯。至於日來英國對捷克臨時政府的正式承認，對波蘭同盟新協定的締結、雖屬一種爲了增厚作戰實力的措置，同時也止意味着這兩個遭際惡劣的民族國家的復活。而遠束進行着的中日戰爭，則更屬現代最偉大的民族運動，象徵着獨立自由與正義、針對了壓迫奴役與侵略，作出死入生的搏鬥。目前的國際現象，雖在表面上極見混亂糢糊，令人不易把握其主流所在，但無論如何，民族問題却正在這一局面當中做魂靈。</p>
<p>民族主義是隨着近代資本主義以俱來的東西，當十九世紀之初，各個弱小民族已因國際經濟政治演變的激盪而開始了自覺，當時連最反動的俄皇亞歷山大，據說都曾爲民族自決原則所感動，表示着：「上帝爲人民之福和而選任的君主、故不得背於人民之志願及利益而割讓土地。」但民族運動的高潮，却是前次歐戰中間的事；奧匈帝國和土耳其帝國都是在這原則之下遭遇了分裂的噩運。所可惋惜的，彼時此一原則的運用，並非專爲被壓迫者　想而使其符合正義公道；却往　遷就戰勝强國的意旨、置若干民族意志於不顧。凡爾賽條約體系曾包孕着若干的禍根，而允以關於民族問題方面者爲允著；以致近年來有如德奧的合併，蘇台德區糾紛，但澤問題以及關於波蘭羅馬尼亞南斯拉夫的少數民族問題與夫割地之爭，都可從上屆歐戰結局當中招待　　的根源。至於波瀾的海諸小國的獨立，固然是蘇聯所自願遂行，其中也並非沒有其他國際策動的脈絡。蘇聯對於民族自決原則的贊助並不是無條件的，尤是當這種分離運動含有反蘇意味的時候。是以此次歐戰之所以發生，以及最近歐陸方面的種種動盪，如果從民族問題方面觀察，都各自具有其歷史上的自然因果。現在歐洲以及世界地圖又屑臨重新劃分的機運，其是否能免蹈前此覆轍，不冉度種下未來禍根、這是具有公道意識的人們所最關心的焦點。</p>
<p>民族主義與民族自決都是應加讚美的原則，其所以轉而釀成種種　源者不外因其不幸而知種種惡劣條件相摻和；所以一個正確的民族運動，必須：第一，應與正義公道原則相符合，絕不應雜有其他反動卑劣的動機；第二，強國對於弱小民族的援助應該出於眞純的動機，絕不應借此惡用，以達到某種不正的慾求；第三，在弱小民族本身也不容急攻近利，不擇手段，致於無形中自陷　　。十年以來，侵略者在國際間會以偽裝的民族口號遂行了許多　　；即如中國也曾因此遭受許多磨難。但像納粹德國對於奥捷波蘭的種種措置，其手段縱可非議，而在歷史上，尤其是在民族觀點上，也未嘗沒有其合理的根據。這種事例絕不容遠東的侵略者妄事此附。</p>
<p>現在世界新的民族運動正在發動、假如歐戰冉繼續蔓延，不知將更有幾許新的問題相繼踵起。這些演變的結果、究將爲未來時代　定幸福的基礎，抑或展轉埋伏無窮　根？都要看這些民族運動如何　趨。換言之，是吾代表着正義與公道的提高，還是以民族口號遮掩其醜惡內幕？當此歧途、其間有最値得注意的一點，就是凡以促進世界真正和平自許的國家、無論其塊實的國際關係具何經緯，必須小吝以助力給予那些眞正爲正義公道而從事生死戰鬥的民族，纔能證明其眞正關切着世界與人類的未來前途。而抗戰的中國就是這樣的一塊萬應萬騐的試金石，</p>

<p>架衣壩田畝，每年可種植兩次，春季　荳，夏季種稻，平原中部土地含水份較多，宜於種植甘蔗，故該處所產之　，其產量之豐，與質料之佳，甲乎全縣，開文墾殖局現擬在短期內將觀音寺之水壩築成，蓄水灌田，第一期即可開墾四萬畝，以後再陸續分二期開墾，期將全壩公私荒地變爲熟地，山之西部爲　城平原，氣候較東部，稍熱水利亦較東部平原爲佳，惟全部田地之賴以灌溉者，僅一西壩河而已，該河容水量不大，修築工程亦不堅固，時有潰決之虞，不過目前還不見得有什麼毛病，賢明之當局，想早已見及，將來或再從事修理也。全縣現有可耕地約五十餘萬畝，山田佔三約分之一，其餘均爲平原之沃地，推因水利關係，已墾者的得五分之一，故水利實爲該縣之要政也。全縣的政治區劃爲六區二鎭，約計居民萬餘戶，據民國二十八年底縣政府調查統計，約共有男女居民十萬左右，除縣城附近外，其他東山附近大多苗夷雜居，種族極爲複雜，有白苗、有民家、擺夷、野人等十餘種，縣城附近，民風淳樸，至開遠的勞働力，相當豐富，尙屬勤苦耐勞，每工人每日工資約國幣八角，已遠較昆明爲便宜　。</p>
<p>物產富饒</p>
<p>開遠地處滇南，氣候幾屬於亞熱帶，雨量極富，終年無雪，霜亦甚少，冬季氣候仍溫暖，故各種作物均甚適宜，產量亦豐，譬如架衣平原，每畝田之生產量，不下於滇省富產之區之宜良縣之上等田，且因天時關係，其他州縣，不適種植者，如熱帶的香蕉，木棉，大豆，甘蔗等，該縣亦能種植，且產量特豐菲他處所能及，即以甘蔗一項而言，僅該縣布沿壩」區所產，即可與其他任何一縣之產量相等，據稅局統計，每年該區售糖收入約在國幣二百九十萬元左右，可　　農，一則因資力　係，其次則墨守成法，出品不佳，若能加以改善，則其產量與銷路，實不可限量也。</p>
<p>棉業發達</p>
<p>除農產外，煤鐵　藏亦多，掘土即現，質料之佳，產量之富，更非他處所可及，滇越路運費過昂，而交通有不便，故除供隣縣作燃料外，當不能盡量運出銷售，須知貨棄於地，以無運銷方法，終於置而不用，苟能集資作大量之運銷，亦有利之事業也，其他如米，馬鈴薯，烟葉，火豆，草棉等，均爲該縣特富之農產，而草棉一項佔雲南全省七分之一，據上年度調查，全省草棉產量六百萬斤，該縣即產八十餘萬斤，此外，尙有木棉一種，爲該縣特產之一，以前因農人不加注意，種植甚少，前歲經棉業專家之倡導，始爲棉農所注意，現在中國，交通，富滇三銀行聯合組織貸款團，貸款棉農，鼓勵種植，使此種特殊富源，發揮其生產，在開遠種，木棉已有一千一百七十五畝，將來再事推廣，實爲一大富源，預料不久之將來，開遠之棉業，當有更大的發展，除此而外，尙有手工業數種，如織布，綫麵，均以經營者均屬小資本，未能盡量發揮，其若牧畜織草蓆等，均係該縣著名之農村副業，如能投資作大規模之生產，前途正亦可觀也。，</p>
<p>設大電廠</p>
<p>該縣因地處適中，生產豐富，故滇省財　爲發展該縣，充實後方起見，已籌款辦雲南鑛業公司發電廠，開工三年，已將完成，實爲雲南省大工程之一，該廠位於某某附近，引用某河水以爲動力，完成之後，可發電一萬基羅瓦特，係供給鑛業公司開採箇舊錫鑛及冶煉外，其多餘之電力，一部供開遠作照明之用，其餘則用作燒煉英坭及煤石等，故水電廠未竣工之前財廳即計劃在某某附近建築水泥廠及煤石廠，此偉大工程不特可以消納後方之勞動力，而且可以挽回不少利權，减少外滙之輸出也，開遠實在是一個極適於投資開發之地，海外僑胞有心於回國興辦實業者，不妨到該處考察一下，集合資本，從事開發，此則非僅個人有利，即國家亦有絕大補益也。</p>

<h3 id="c53">蘇聯女飛行家　不停飛行　重慶的防空　跑警報經已深　防空洞冬暖夏涼 <a href="#c53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>重慶通訊，重慶的空襲常在夜間，據報上登載說，日間空襲日機約損失可以在百分之四左右，夜間只在百分之一。六左右，大約初七，八至廿二，三是夜襲期間，尤其是月半左右。</p>
<p>在空襲警報以前，常有機關人員將日機抵宜昌或萬縣的消息傳出，叫做消息。消息傳出後，婦孺卽爭先恐後的携帶衣服和防空凳（皮匠用的帆布凳），紛紛的避向鄰近的防空洞中。現在防空司令部一俟有消息，卽懸一個紅球在高處，空襲警報時增　球，緊急警報將二球都除下。緊急警報時，如敵機還遠掛一球，更遠掛二球，稍近去一球，更近則另一球也除去，解除警報時掛一個綠球。</p>
<p>重慶是天然的防空城，城中都是高山，現在所有的防空洞差不多可容全市的人，在空襲時間，凡有竊盜者均槍斃，所以財產都很安全。</p>
<p>防空洞外常有二三個小販，賣花生米，開水，凉粉，也有賣枇杷和杏子的。</p>
<p>避到洞中去的貧苦的人，都帶着被褥，以便在洞中睡覺時當枕頭用，比較有錢一點的，也有携帶小箱籠的。洞中的小孩，大都不睡也不哭叫，大概是明白情形的嚴重和經歷已多的原故吧。</p>
<p>防空洞中，兩旁有兩排木凳，中間空處可容兩人並肩站立，空氣頗新鮮，冬暖夏凉。一般婦孺和胆小的男子，常在空襲警報後跑進去爭座位。緊急警報後，從從容容而來的人，往往坐在洞外石階上，因爲那時洞口照着進去的路燈已熄滅。</p>
<p>洞裏的人，坐着打瞌睡的或睡着的，洞中只點着幾盞油燈，也有學生點着一支蠟燭讀書，這個可以給他一個防學士的微號，洞中日間空襲時，也看書的人，所以重慶跑警報的經騐已很深，眞可謂身經百警</p>

<p>— 愛成</p>
<p>前言</p>
<p>直接稅非但不容易轉嫁，並且收入很穩定；而其稅率可以採用累進制，所以非常公平。歐美各國相繼採用，而其對於財政收入中所佔之部分亦逐漸增加。然我國財政上之收入向以　關統三稅爲主，但自民國二十五年後，也步他國後　，首先開徵所得稅，繼鑒各種產業　形發達，又開徵過分利得稅。並於今歲復開徵遺產稅。據一般人謂，繼承人所得之一大筆遺產，可說與任何人所發之一筆橫財相仿。並未化用自己勞力。但國家對其安全常加以保護，國家當可向之課稅，以彌補財政上之不足。同時，遺產稅之負擔者，推論起來，並非爲繼承者，而爲被繼承人自己，但被繼承於事先並不覺察負擔該項稅額之痛苦，目稅源亦極穩固，不易爲環境所影響。因之，遺產稅可說爲直接稅中之最公平者。</p>
<p>遺產之內容</p>
<p>按我國遺產稅條例之規定，以屬地主義爲原則，以屬人主義爲例外，卽不論何人在中國有遺產者，應課稅，卽中國在國外而在國內有財產者，亦應課稅。今先將遺產內容解釋之。遺產爲死者所遺下之財產。而其內容有廣狹之分。廣義遺產除積極財產外，再包括消極財產。消極財產卽所謂債務之類。通常之繼承卽爲繼承廣義遺產。至狹義遺產，卽自積極財產中扣除消極財產後所剩餘之部份。今課徵遺產稅之標的，理論上當應以狹義遺產爲限。遺產稅條例亦作如此規定。且扣除之範圍頗廣。（一）依法應繳納之稅捐，及罰金（刑罰罰鍰（行政罰）。（二）被繼承人死亡前未償之債務。（三）管現遺產及執行遺囑之必要費用。（四）農業用具或從事其他各業者之工作用具，價値未超過五百元者。（五）依法未達採伐年齡之橋木。此外尙有規定某種遺產，因其情况之特殊免納遺產稅。（一）遺產總額未滿五千元。（二）陸海軍官佐士兵及公務員，戰時陣亡或戰事服務受傷致死者之遺產。（三）遺產中有關文化歷史美術之圖書物品，經繼承人向遺產徵收機關聲明保存登記者，但繼承人將此項圖書物品轉讓時，仍須補稅。（四）捐助各級政府之財產。（五）捐贈敎育文化或慈善公益事業之財產，未超過五十萬元者。（六）被繼承人之著作權，及關於學術發明之專利權，或自己創作之美衛品。</p>
<p>逃稅之可能</p>
<p>但於遺產之內容中有一問題頗難解決，卽被繼承人生前向保險公司保有壽險，死後所得之賠償金，應吾歸入遺產中一併計算。我國保險法雖公布而尙未施行。按通常情形及一般法理上言，此種死後所得之賠償金，並不能視爲死者之財產，因獲得此項財產，須以被保險人之死作爲時期。所以這筆賠償金須於被繼承人死後，才能由受益人得到。從邏輯上論，亦不能視為遺產。因此，被繼承死後，雖遭破產，但人壽保險賠償金並不歸入破產財團一併計算，家屬可享受全部利益。若於遺產稅條例中亦作同樣解釋，則賠償金就不得課稅。但本條例未作詳細明文規定。若作如此解釋，似與開徵遺產稅之原理不符。因賠償金若母須徵稅，則被繼承人於事先儘可將其財產作爲人壽保險之用，擴大保險金額，與保險人訂立終身爲期不附生存條件之死亡保險契約。死後，繼承人卽能取得全部免稅之財產。今爲避免此種弊端，與遷就事實起見，還是加入遺產一併計算爲妥。至遺產之逃稅方法頗多，略述如下：</p>
<p>（一）生時分割。被繼承人生時分割遺產，並不一定含有惡意。如死者爲避免死後子女間有分割遺產之麻煩起見，常於生時分割。但惡意之分割，當在所不免。如死前先將遺產拆開，分立子女戶名。最普通者如鄕下之田地房屋。至動產更易分割，母須法定手續，祇須分別占有，卽可達預期目的。此種分割，我國較歐美風行，因我國與歐美風氣不同。歐美尙個人主義，父子間各自獨立，通常須迨父死後才能繼承其父之財產。在我國則家庭制度盛行，常因分居結婚與營業先將財產分配。因之，本條例卽酌量規定，凡於被繼承人死亡前三年內，分析財產者，其所分得之財產，仍視爲遺產之一部份，合併微稅，不無理由。</p>
<p>（二）生時贈與，或偽造債務。生時贈與，卽將各部財產儘量作虛僞或眞正之贈與第三人，使遺產總額减少到最小限度。但此種贈與除由法律明文規定爲無效外，通常可根據行使權利不得損害他人權利之法理以對抗之。本條例卽明文規定，凡在死亡前三年內所作爲贈與之財產，仍視爲遺產。至偽造債務，卽使消極財產增加，間接使遺產相對减少，課稅額即可减輕。此二方法於限定繼承中，常爲繼承人所應用。今課征遺產稅之先，必有繼承事實，權承人若於繼承事實中爲此種行爲，將於遺產課稅中亦可得到利益，一舉兩得。</p>
<p>（三）隱　財產，或遺產薄上作虛偽之記載。隱　財產，即將已何之財產　藏，不爲他人所悉。所隱匿之財產通常爲動產，允以價貴量小者居多。如鑽戒或現余最易爲被繼承人所隱匿。至遺產簿上作虛僞之記載，如儘量將財產價値壓低，以致　價委員會將來難免受其事先之暗示，而被蒙閉，此亦爲限定繼承中常遇之事</p>
<p>（四）將財產匯往國外。此可說爲一種脫法行爲，如華僑與木國發生貿易，常與本國銀行訂立往來戶，或儲有存款以作担保。但於本國並無住址。臨死之時，爲避免課稅，卽將是項存款提出，滙往國外，政府卽難以處置。若在中國有住址，則又當別論。</p>
<p>（五）生時雖不分割，但將財產拆開各立戶名。此方法常用於銀行之存款方面，如將某銀行之存款之戶名定爲福記，某銀行之存款之戶名爲祿記。戶名雖多，而人祗一個。因此死後遺產之總額，卽難以調查而確定。累進稅之特徵，亦卽難於表現。如已開徵之所得稅稅率，雖亦爲累進制，但因收入總額不易確定，仍分別徵課，其中不平之處，顯而易見。</p>
<p>防止逃稅之擬議</p>
<p>至防止逃稅之方法有積極與消極之分。積極方面卽努力灌輸人民之知識，鼓勵愛國熱忱。使般人民皆知遺產稅之眞正意義，決非爲政府之敲詐行爲。並解釋遺產稅課征後政府將如何受益。凡此種種，皆能使人民樂而爲之，自動繳納。因之，不但可使稅額增加，並使征稅所化之費用亦减少。至消極方面之防止，如訂立典刑。凡有惡意而欲减少稅額隱匿財產者，罰之。但所訂刑度不必過嚴，祗須偵查嚴密。務使違法者難逃法網。並獎勵檢舉隱匿遺產之工作。其次，如對各人之財產有詳細之記録，當地主管官署常加調查，使當地財產情况瞭如指掌，隱匿之事當難做到。同時戶口須有　密調查，因此亦不易濫立戶名。但消極之預，防究不如積極預防之澈底與經濟。蓋消極預防，費用毫大，且逃稅方法花樣繁多。如上海一地，外商金融勢力頗大，故一般人們欲隱匿財產可於事先皆存之於外商銀行。至於對銀行之利息所課征之所得稅率，一律祗爲利息總額之百分之五者，其原因亦在此。蓋採取累進稅率後，擁有大富者，決不願將其全部財產存入華商銀行。因之，非但稅收無着，卽中國之金融力量亦將受損。</p>
<p>今遺產稅，我國尚屬切試，當不能立即求其獲得圓滿效果。唯最大之缺點爲遺產稅之課征，太注意於課稅之標的。所得稅亦復如是。如被繼人某甲有家産四百萬元抽稅百分之二十後，剩三百六十萬元，遺有一妻三子年齡尚幼，來日負担繁重。但另有某乙亦有四百萬元家財，抽稅後亦祗存三百六十萬元，祗遺有妻子一負担很輕，兩者相比，稅率雖同一，但事實上似前者所課者較後者爲重。除非將前者之稅率减輕，或後者之稅率加重，才配稱公平。因此，稅率除以課稅之標的數量之大小作爲　增之標準外尚須　　繼承人之環境務使獲得事實上之公平。惟我人深信遺產開徵後，對國家財政上總不無多少裨益。</p>
<h3 id="c88">「黃金廁所」論與「黃金餐桌」論 <a href="#c88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>— 章式之</p>
<p>在上次歐戰末年，列寗領導蘇俄人民實施社會主義革命時，會宣稱：「把世界的所有黃金，集中起來替代磚瓦；用以砌成幾間公共厠所的牆壁。」這個主張雖沒有實行，但黃金在蘇聯國內，確已不被一般人重視，蘇聯政府雖努力加緊黃金的生產，但是專以供給一般資本主義國家的需要。他們所歡迎的是貨物，是有用的貨物。</p>
<p>現在，歐戰剛進入第二時期；但德國方面，已在高談闊論着戰後的世界經濟和世界了。柏林的總　報主筆溫士楚博士，最近發表一篇論文；（見本月廿三日本報）他對於戰後的黃金用途，認爲萬分狹隘；「沒有人再願帶這種笨重東西；世界人民，都喜用銀行的鈔票和支票；不願再用黃金付款。」　滿了黃金的美國，恐也只有「把黃金融化，　成金器，充美國公使及大使的餐桌之用。」</p>
<p>同樣的：德國經濟部部長芬克氏也說：戰後國際經濟機構，將「向着淸算制度發展，」「歐洲將來的貨幣，不能再以黃金爲基礎。」所以他說：「吾等不敢預言美國黃金的將來如何」</p>
<p>本來，黃金旣不能直接用以充饑，又不能直接用以蔽體：他對於人類的物質生活，可謂一無貢獻。只因他被用爲交易上的一種媒介工具，便造成了他今日的「萬能狀態一。又因爲他的生產地域分佈不均，又因爲他的積聚形態分配不均；因此而有的發生一黃金充血症」，有的發生「黃金貧血症，」使一般的社曾經濟以至整個的世界經濟，都誘發了種種不安。所以第一次歐戰後的貨幣思潮裏，早就有吾定硬幣的價値論。而一九二九年世界恐慌發生以來，各國的先後放棄金本位，實則已是這種貨幣理論的初步實踐。但是蘇德對於黃金的輕視，與其說是基於貨幣理論，母寗說是出諸政治作用較近實際。</p>
<p>人對於人，國對於國，本來總不忘其特有的武器。他們用　他特有的武器來　高自己的地位，增大控制對方的勢力。於是而在社會間，形成了貧富的不平等；在國際間，形成了强弱的不平等。列寗旣在領導無產階級革命，當然：他先要解除資產階級的武裝。資產階級　着他們特有的黃金來製造自己的特殊權所，勢以他便來一個「黃金厠所論。</p>
<p>德國降服法國之後，英德大戰的前途雖尙未可逆覩；但是他在歐陸的地位，無疑地已鳴驚人。</p>
<p>德國經濟上最大的弱點。便是黃金貧乏。如果依照他的理想，來改造歐洲的經濟；第一，當然也先要把黃金在現代經濟機構中的地位推倒。解除別國的武裝，便是强化自己的權勢。這是不消說的了！</p>
<p>更要注意的是：德國方面發表此種理論的今日，正是美國深感黃金過於膨脹的時候；允其是在羅斯福接受第三次當選爲總統候選人之日。羅斯福總統富有強烈的正義感，而美人又宿命的傾向於聯英。德國方面，當然常明瞭這點。集中金銀政策，是羅斯福總統新政運動中的一環。他企圖藉此以樹立控制國際金融的基礎，從而依照他的理想，重行分配世界的金銀，建立一新的國際金融。此點，在黃金貧乏的德國，允爲瞭解。因此：在羅斯福總統第三度接受當選如民主黨總統候選人的時候，德國方面接連發表「黃金餐桌」論，其間並非沒有聯繫性存在着；也可以想像得之。說得明顯些：這種「黃金餐桌」論，可以增大美國人對於黃金充血的苦悶，可以助長美國一部份反對新政運動得聲勢；在美國總統選舉中，或可以因此而發生若千合乎德國朴益的作用；這或許是德人今日特別高興作此討論的另一個理由罷？假使德國也擁有大量黃金，那末他便未必再願意如此做了！正因爲德國是黃金貧乏國，同時，他在歐陸又確已樹立起他的地位了；加以世界的黃金，積集於美國的確又實在太多，而美國朝野間對此過於膨脹了的黃金實在也感到無法疏散之苦。在這國際政局激變與世界黃金分配激變之外，還加貨幣思潮之早已超脫黃金的拘束，因此戰後黃金的地位之變動，大槪也屬不可避免的趨勢了吧？</p>

<p>據上海經濟咨詢所報告，上週滙市，不特未脫盤旋，且起伏愈演愈平，成交數量微小，並以掉期居多，美滙最高六元一二五，最低六元〇六二五，英滙最高三辦士八九〇六二五，最低三辦士八四三七五，平穩若此，蓋由於國際局勢，國內軍事之醖釀者半，和平空氣之若隱若現者又半，而最近對外貿易，數字銳减，時屆淡月，勢固宜然，國際路綫，疊生障碍，所受影響，亦非淺鮮，貿易旣遭頓挫，外滙之供求自减，雖曰滙市之波動，由於投機者從中作祟，然滙市之走勢，端賴商業爲之推移，彼待機血動者，不過推波助瀾，固不足以左右原有之走勢，况五月間之風潮，經營者大抵創鉅痛深，元氣未復，卽有餘資，亦踟躕不前矣。</p>
<p>自歐局惡化，南洋方面挾資返滬者不知有多少，再以英政府加緊貨幣管理，直接或間接與英鎊連繫之貨幣，不免感覺不安，加以美英滙兌，又受限制，故來滬拋出外滙掉取法幣者，日見增多，最近本埠各銀行存款驟增，聞大都來自外埠，卽其明證。</p>
<p>卽以本埠持滙票者而論，因滙票之用途日狹，且險象環生，亦遊子思家，及時脫手，仍以法幣爲依歸，彼悲觀者，以爲　市遊資充斥，一日羣購外滙，實爲滙市之隱憂，殊不知遊資之所以充斥，正因對外幣發生疑實，二五歸原，仍回　狀，此外尚有　著之現象，即黃金外匯之　勢日見軋下，回憶本年五月，外滙轉緊時，金價撳至七百元至千元之鉅，今則僅撳三四百元，按黃金每至撳度愈小，卽可證美滙需要缺少，因投機家購買黃金，必須實力，雖有押款可做，然限於法令，爲數有限，滙票稍付定金，卽有一二月期貨可做，故黃金雖與外滙同一趨勢，然在供求關係上，滙票之需要較爲廣泛，而實際用途，允以滙票爲先，兩者走勢軋近，顯示各方對外滙殊少興趣，再觀滙劃貼現之减低，現期貨滙價之軋攏，　可見市象之趨勢矣</p>

<p>續昨—七月二十七日止—</p>
<p>但是在這法施行之後，對於自由英鎊的來源，還是無法完全斷絕，它的來源計有（一）英鎊集團內外資應得的紅利和利息；（二）外人在英錄集團保險公司中取得的保險賠軟；（三）由外人的英鎊存款移轉爲央人或另一外人的英鎊存款；（四）根據戰前契的而輸入英國貨物的英鎊付款。由這四方面而產生的自由英鎊，仍依紐約市塲上行市而交易，所以英國政府若要澈底取締自由英鎊，勢非得美國的幫助不可。</p>
<p>七月十八日英國實施新的管理英鎊條例，這條例的內容，詳情到現在尙無法知道，根據路透社倫敦十九日電訊是紐約聯邦準備銀行與英格蘭銀行一樣，依四、〇二五賣英鎊，四、〇三五買英鎊，而設立一個「登記帳目」Registered　accounts），除美國外，英政府與瑞士（按瑞士亦爲自由英鎊活動之塲所）加拿大、紐芬蘭，荷屬東西印度·比利時·剛果·叙利亞·瑞典·阿根廷·巴西·羅馬尼亞亦有特別協定。但是不管它的內容詳情如何，單是就紐約聯邦準備銀行按四·〇二五—四·〇三五賣買英鎊底一點看來，自然是自由英鎊的一種威脅，所以英倫方面深信自由英鎊行市雖然現在，紐約市塲仍舊每日開做，但不久的將來是會消滅的，</p>

<p>— 逸梅</p>
<p>竹夫人：自歐風東漸，我國固有之物，一一諸淘汰，如夏日所用之竹夫人，予生也晚，已不及見其製作；聞諸故孫漱石先生云：「竹夫人以四五分闊之靑竹片製之，長約三尺許，圓周之直徑約六七寸，通體作梅花格，而空共中，夏夜置諸簟席·臨臥時以臂挾之而睡，體肥者可令兩腋淸凉，無垢汗蒸膚之苦，昔時世家巨室中人每用之。蘇東坡有詩云：「贈君無語竹夫人，」卽是此物·則宋時已有之，其製固甚　也有此者，滬上在南市大東門外篾竹街之　竹店，而製此之竹工，則爲　　　子及餛飩　之巧匠，以其通身須異常光　，且不見　頭何在，凡兩篾交接之處，皆嵌入篾底，不令人　，其手法　精也。」據許月旦先生談：「粵中曩時曾改竹製爲漆皮製，兩頭不通，如一長枕，名曰　枕。」予則并此欖枕而未克寓目，殊自愧也。竹夫人之見於前人典籍者，如吳梅村之南柯子云：「玉骨香無汗，從敎換兩頭，受人顚倒被人勾，只是更無陽肚便風流。矮小通身滑，玲瓏滿眼愁，有些情性欠溫柔，怕的一時拋擲在深秋。」又明張居正　　熱，製不安席，某吏獻媚，特製一湘竹所編竹夫人，以實玉嵌成鴛鴦雙宿狀，中實凉爽馥郁之藥物，嗅領之心脾俱淸，居正大悅，某吏得升躋通顯，竹夫人之力也。又聞人談：清宮中有乾隆　用竹夫人一具，不用竹製，而以象牙編成之，因手　汗漬故，色瑩透如赤玉，惟故宮古物展覽會中未曾陳列，今更不知流落何處矣。惜哉！</p>
<p>竹衫　竹衫編細竹爲之，而繫之以綫，成方勝孔隙，異常凉爽，其編製絕細密，否則刺　作痛，失共功用　，在此　署，整其服　，外出酬　，若　身無所　　，則汗液透　，成汗淋學士，甚不雅觀，蓋共時尚無汗衫等物，不得不借此一項領竹衫以爲襯墊也。因屬習用之品，街頭巷陌，時有　具代人修理竹衫者，一如現今之修陽傘　墊然。自汗杉興，不復有用竹形者；然演劇之武生，夏日演武戲，易於汗透重衣，什九仍　竹衫，此外不多見也。相傳有淸朱竹　詞人有一竹衫，異常精　，細竹上鏤以冰梅紋，共時物價殊低，然此，然此竹衫一，計　八十金，乃門生某奉以爲　見醴者，尚儉之流，無不認爲該人聽聞也。</p>

<p>— 奇石</p>
<p>草帽爲暑中外出必不可少之物，戰後價大昂，且多劣貨，若每年一味棄舊換新，旣不經濟，且有虧良心，茲有一法足以使草帽去陳爲新，法簡而廉，爲鄙人兩年來實騐所得，用敢爲本輯讀者介紹如下：</p>
<p>取上等用於擦面盆等用之去汚（垢）粉少許，取舊牙刷潔凈者蘸之，和適量之水，綠草帽之外表，細細刷之，務使遍及無遺，然後用水將去汚（垢）粉及塵垢之混合物冲洗去，同時以牙刷刷之，若仍有灰汚處，則再以上法重複之，至完全潔凈爲止。凉乾，卽得。至此，往時黃汚，煥然一如新者，所費較洗作索價低廉多多，讀者何妨一試。</p>
<h3 id="c99">漫談冰忌廉 <a href="#c99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>夏天一展開，在上海這都市裏面，冷飲市也跟着展開了。在冷飲食品中，一般的說來，冰忌廉算最風行了。在歐美各國，冰忌廉通年有人常吃，夏天當然銷塲更大，在中國，冬天雖然也可買到冰忌廉，吃的人可不多，到了夏天才有人買來吃。</p>
<p>單就上海說來，每年的夏天，冰忌廉的銷數，如果作一統計，怕是非常驚人叫雞？愛吃冰忌廉的人，我們在冷眼旁觀中，可以看出女人比男人多，而目前一般的兒童，也十九愛吃冰忌廉。在這種情形之下，冰忌廉的銷路，自然一年年的在增加起來。</p>
<p>西瓜本來是中國人的消暑食品，但這幾年，爲了中日戰事，上海已成「孤島」，西瓜的售價幾倍於戰前，一般人都感到吃不起西瓜之苦？就去買冰忌廉吃。事實上冰忌廉並不見得便宜，但因爲不必像西瓜樣整　買，錢零碎拿出去，當然是不覺得的。</p>
<p>這幾天，我們走到街市上去，烟紙店，糖果店，食品店，那一家不是另闢一部出售冷飲物品，而冰忌廉成了他們主要的售品。還有人臨時開起冷飲攤子來，出售冰忌廉。到處掛出了冰忌廉的市招，旗子，眞已變成了冰忌廉的世界呢！</p>
<p>冰忌廉的主要原料，是牛乳，鷄蛋糖，這些東西。爲了近來成本的高貴，售價比去年也漲了一倍以上。據說製作冰忌廉利息是很好的，歐美各國的大都市　，有不少富翁是因冰忌廉而起家的。上海的海寗洋行，而今也獨佔了冰忌廉市塲。</p>
<p>但冰忌廉雖然可消夏，解渴，也不宜多吃，如果多吃了就容易致病，使腸胃中發生變化。尤其是女性，飲得過多，在生理方面要發生暗病。至於廉價劣質冰忌廉，更不宜吃，所謂「冰忌廉」我們應記在心上，勿貪便宜而買劣質冰忌廉才好，吾則吃了要出毛病的。</p>
<h3 id="c100">夏天三害 <a href="#c100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>— 新方</p>
<p>我們都知道蚊子·蒼蠅·及臭虫是夏天中的三害。時季已屆盛暑，又是這三種害虫的猖獗時間了。所以，我們應該知道來防禦了，如果多有了些關於它們的常識，我想至少在你們的身體上可以加了一層保障；在下面，就以筆者所知，拉雜的來與各位談談。</p>
<p>蚊子：普通所謂瘧疾，卽由一種瘧蚊爲病原的。瘧蚊與普通蚊子有二點不同：一·瘧蚊在停歇時身體是傾斜的；普通蚊子是平的。二，瘧蚊的翅膀上是有斑點的，而普通蚊子則無。至於防蚊的方法，基本的條件還是人人要注意衛生；此外，如燃蚊烟香及在汚水地方澆些火油等，亦能把蚊子及其幼虫消除。關於蚊子有一個可怕的統計，在暹羅，每年死於蚊子下的人，較死於老虎下的人，超出竟達一百倍，蚊子的有害於人類由此可見一斑了</p>
<p>蒼蠅：一對蒼蠅在一個夏季內，可以產下三萬萬的後代；這種繁殖的速度實在是可怕的；所以，對於撲滅的工作，亦是需要積極進行。大家如有暇餘的時間，不妨也可以的聚了幾個同伴來組織一個撲蠅隊、捕蠅紙·捕蠅拍等工具是用來直接撲滅蠅的成虫的；在厠所內或穢物堆上蒼蠅幼虫繁生的地方，我們需用硼砂·火油。石灰等來澆灌才可撲除它們·每年衛生當局到了夏天，總在驚醒各界人士蒼蠅叮過的東西不可吃，爲了各種時疫病如痢疾、霍亂等，莫不多由蒼蠅直接做媒介的。我們允須注意及之；萬不要爲了一時的貪慾，而置自己的寶貴身體於不顧</p>
<p>臭虫：它的身體是扁平而小，所以捕捉是極不容易的。當人體爲該虫刺螫後，常常會感到痛癢；這時候，如用硼酸水或醋來塗擦，那麼就可以不再感到痛癢。近來，市上新出的裝滅臭虫藥劑很多，據聞，効騐都相當不差。</p>
<p>夏天是一個最可怕的季節；希望大家能够加倍珍惜你們的身體。「無病卽是福」，自己的福需要自己來愛護的、</p>

<p>夏季菜蔬中，瓜類也占着重要的地位，如冬瓜黃瓜絲瓜和廣東人愛吃的凉瓜苦瓜等，廣東館子裏一個冬瓜盅，代價貴得嚇人，其實在家裏做起來，簡便得很，也要不了多少錢。你只要買一個小型的冬瓜，剖爲上下兩半，將瓜子瓜瓤挖去，裏而放下十景丁子，最後買一副雞雜或鴨雜，切成丁子，再將火腿香菌邊尖等切小加入，酌加精鹽，上面用鮮荷葉覆蓋紮緊，隔水蒸熟，吃時將荷葉揭去，淸芬可喜，那瓜中的十景丁子全已熟透，酥爛可口，湯汁尤其鮮美，夏季葷菜中，的確可以榮居首席呢。</p>

<p>— 秋郎</p>
<p>酒在良字中佔着重要部分，它雖是糜費的奢侈品之一，但此會間遇着慶弔大典的時候，總是少不了它的，便是平時友朋酬酢，市樓買醉，戚串往還，家庭連歡，也仗它做了介紹，吃酒的人，更說得好聽：「三杯和萬事，一醉解千愁！」喝酒本不算罪惡的事，但怕一個「癮」字，有了「癮」，早醉夕醺，遺悮公幹，而且多飲傷腦，濕也奇重；很易息濕氣病，最好逢年過節和酬應塲中，略吃幾杯，尚不妨事，實則在此國難方殷的時候，其他飲食還須節約，當然更不應該喝酒！筆者茲將酒的種種，約略摘錄數則，以博讀者一粲。</p>
<p>酒的種類：酒的種類是很多的，以國產論，在國中最馳名的，首推紹興酒，這固然是製法的完善，但大半也仗着紹地鑑湖水質的淳厚所致，據說易地就不能製出這佳釀了。其他山西的汾酒，也很聞名，此外高粱燒酒之類，因其性烈，喜吃的人，泰半爲勞工界，取其易於過癮，至於菓類可釀酒的也很多，不勝縷述，國藥舖中的幾種藥酒，迺是活絡筋骨，醫治病症所服，此是例外的。若論舶來品的酒，也有：白蘭地，啤酒，畏士忌，畏士格等，但歐戰後，因運輸困難，價格飛漲，所幸張裕公司，已有仿製數種國產出品，確能挽回利權不少。</p>
<p>酒的故事：關於酒的故事也不少，莫若李謫仙的：「太白斗酒詩百篇，天子呼來不上船，自稱臣是酒中仙，」古今傳爲佳話。而曠達豪放，又要推劉伶了，他的飲酒，是携了荷鋤者相隨，意思是一時在飲醉倒，便隨地給他瘞埋好了！此外有司馬相如的貂裘換酒，和白衣送酒，雙柑斗酒等，也多得不勝枚舉，可是在歷史上，都播爲美談的事蹟。</p>
<p>酒的名言：孔子說：「惟酒無量，不及亂。」朱子說「勿飲過量之酒。」可知聖賢對於酒，雖無禁吃的言論，但總勸人們少吃，不可過量爲是。他若諺語所說：「酒是穿腸毒藥」「酒不醉人人自醉」「酒爲色之媒」又佛門中的：「戒酒除葷，」或以愼食和嚴肅爲準則，或以戒殺和衛生爲依歸這些也都是誥誡人們的警語哩！</p>
<p>文人與酒：吃酒對於人的身體，固然利少害多，但人們偏喜飲酒，尤其是一般文人雅士，與麴藥有了聯繫。且美其名曰：「詩酒留連，」像詩聖李靑蓮獨酌名句：「舉杯邀明月，對影成三人，」，他的興致，何等高超，飲酒宜擇幽蒨之地，最妙在花前月下，低酌淺斟，永榭風亭，擎杯少飲，待薄醉微酲，以後，或拈題分詠，或佳句連吟，自覺倍增逸興，樂趣無窮，比較祇知在吞牛飲的俗子，專以酗酒尋釁爲事的，不可同日而話了。</p>

<h3 id="c106">銀錢業同人　消費合作社　一周年 <a href="#c106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>— 籟天</p>
<p>假使讀者不健忘的話，我想一定還記得本報於去年今日會刋載一篇關於本市銀錢業同人組織的消費合作社的文章，那時這個消費合作社也就是開始營業的第一天，今年今日，她已經在艱苦環境下努力了一個年頭了。</p>
<p>上海自從國軍西撤，惡劣勢力就乘機侵入，統制，操縱，囤積……等手段，造成生活指數飛躍高漲，把四五百萬市民的生活投入痛苦的深淵，尤其是一般薪給階級，更受到莫大的威脅。被人譽稱「金飯碗」的銀錢業的同人們，也因客觀需要而首先組織自助人的消費合作社，以「人人爲我，我爲人人」的偉大精神，團結二千多位同人，共同集合小額資金，充分發揮了她的服務效能。</p>
<p>我們在她一週紀念的機會，把過去一年來堅苦奮鬥的情形，據作者知道的，簡略寫在下面，想不致爲多餘的事吧」。</p>
<p>銀錢業同人們，鑒於本身生活與收入不平衡，亟需有組織合作團體來减輕同人的生活負擔，去年四月裏在數十位熱心同人積極籌備和全體金融界前輩熱忱贊助之下，正式成立消費合作社，微求社員二千餘人，社股達六千餘元，遂於去年七月三十日那天在南京路三三四號三樓開始營業。</p>
<p>一年來她的營業額的三萬元左右，其中煤球的數量占去一部份，其餘大都是日用必需品。定價方面，始終抱定折衷主義，使得社員有减輕負擔的機會。而進貨的工作，也關係整個消費合作社的前途的，所以原則上係向生產廠家直接批購，如中國化學工業社，五和織造廠，義泰興煤球廠，冠生園，泰康……所遺憾的，有許多廠家並不給予消費合作社以特殊優待權利，可是在數量上，約有三萬三千餘元，當然已是一個龐大的數字了。</p>
<p>此外她也替銀錢業辦了一般性的福利工作：如饗應上海民食維持會和上海民食調節協會，辦理小額（由五十包起碼改爲一包）集團訂購洋米辦法；和用戶煤球預購辦法，使社員們的生活必需品，盡了最大的調節和服務。</p>
<p>消費合作社在大都市裏，因爲有商業競爭的關係，本來是敵不過擁有巨大資金的大商業資本家的，而今銀錢業消費合作社努力的成績，並不過份使我們失望，去年社員購買紅利每元也可派四分，實際上，已給予社員「不儲而蓄」的美果。</p>
<p>最近她在舉行一週紀念大特價中，發售全部貨品，一律削碼，用意在紀念一年來社員互助合作的光榮的歷史，同時也給予非社員們一個非常好的影象，祇有大家精誠合作，才能解除一切困難和經濟壓迫。</p>

<p>聽說個美國人最近發明了一種亢進食慾的電影，看了這電影就可增加食慾，現在孤島上米價飛漲，假使這電影到上海來映，那麼米價恐怕還要飛漲不已呢。但假使有人能冉發明一種電影，使人看了之後，大倒胃口，飯食不進，那麼米價定可因之大跌而特跌，我想這倒是抑平米價的最有效的辦法。</p>
<p>霍桑探案</p>
<h3 id="c109">舞后的宿 <a href="#c109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>— 程小青著</p>
<p>第四章　　種推想</p>
<p>霍桑搖搖頭，緩緩說：「我不能接受。這裏面有兩個矛盾點：第一，那手槍是從窗口裏打進來的，不像是進了這客室打的。那屍體坐的姿態，椅背上的槍洞，和壁上的槍彈，都是淺鮮的明證。第二，我們已知道發槍以後不多時，屋子裏的三個人便都驚醒起來。從情勢上推想，金梅跟李芝範從聽得檢聲以後，爬起來披了衣裳，走下兩層樓梯趕到這裏，大概至多不過三四分鐘。就算兇手在裏面開槍，這短時間中那人要藏好手槍，拿取死者的腕上的手鐲，指上的戒指，和耳朶上的耳環，還要逃出去，而且逃出時不會給老毛聽得脚聲，可見步子也一定不能怎樣快，那末時間上不會太侷促嗎？」</p>
<p>倪金壽暗暗點着頭，說道：「從死者的傷勢上看，那打槍的人也許果眞是站在外面短牆邊打的。」</p>
<p>霍桑點頭道：「對了，這是無疑的，第一個矛盾點可以解釋了。可是首飾的不見，又怎樣解釋？」</p>
<p>倪金壽搔着頭皮呑吐地說：「也許—也許他開了槍就奔進來偷伊的首飾。」</p>
<p>霍桑連連搖頭道：「不對，不對。你太糊塗了！我剛才說渦第二個矛盾點，就是時間問題。這個人假定在室中開了槍，隨手竊取首飾，在時間上還嫌侷促，你怎麼說他能在外面開了槍冉奔進來？幷且但照那兩行足印整齊不亂，又沒有聲響，也決不像是奔的，却像是一步一步走的。」</p>
<p>倪金壽用手拍着他自己的額角，懊喪地說：「眞要命！這樣的案子眞是太複雜了！」</p>
<p>這時我忽然又想得一種見解：「霍桑，你想會不會開槍的人和脚印的人是兩個人？那甲印的人剛才進來，外面的人恰巧發槍，這申印的人就忽忽拿了東西逃走？」</p>
<p>霍桑抬起頭來向我瞧瞧，仍不表示意見。不過道不表示中，分明已有幾分近情，因爲他也並不曾駁斥。</p>
<p>他又自言自語地說：「這問題的確困人的腦筋。從情勢上看，很象妒殺，同時又像謀財。我現在委實找不出什麼合理的解釋。此外還有抽屜上的鑰匙，抽屜中的鈔票，現在都不能明白。……金壽兄，我想與其坐着空談理論，還不如冉尋求些實際的事實。」倪金壽道：「你打算怎樣進行？」（五九）</p>
<h3 id="c110">我們期待著佳音 <a href="#c110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>— 人</p>
<p>關於工潮的話</p>
<p>本月二十三日各報，載有中央當局對滬市工潮迭起頗爲關懷的消息一則，讀了很使我們感奮：中央當局指出「在此非常時期，勞資風雨同舟，應本協調合作之精神。」這一點是誰都表示擁護的。</p>
<p>在中央的「戰時經濟條例」　，是禁止怠工或罷工的；但我們知道，在這一二年之中，上海所有的怠工罷工事件，差不多都是因爲物價高漲，勞方向資方要求改善待遇未遂而引起的：我們祗要看有許多自動改善了職工生活的商號，就沒有發生過工潮。這一點甚至遠在千萬里的中央當局亦爲親切了解，該指示中有謂：「至物價高漲，勞工生計困難，則資方在可能範圍，自應接納工人要求，或自動予以改善。」我想賢明的上海資方應該竭誠來擁護這一指示吧！又同日報載，租界當局對工潮亦頗爲重視，據云「……目前當局初步調查各公用事業及工廠之生活待遇，如確屬微薄，難資維持生活者，當與資方當局磋商改善，以免藉口發生罷工。」我們認爲租界當局在過去一二三年中，對界內勞資糾紛已盡了很大力量，但過去還是屬於治標的，現在已有進一步的治本辦法的出現，這對於界內職工，甚至全體市民，都會感到喜悅，並且會更竭誠地來擁護租界當局。</p>
<p>因之，我們期待着佳音。</p>

<h3 id="e18">The National Question in Today's International Arena <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>With the evolution of the European War's future still uncertain, new stirrings are seen in the international arena regarding national union and division. In the Far East, India and Burma both have independence movements in preparation. The Breton people within France, after four hundred years of quiescence, have suddenly developed an attempt to organize a national state after France's defeat. On the other hand, the three small Baltic states, having just gained independence through national self-determination after the previous European war, have cancelled their independence and joined the Soviet Union through a voluntary request. As for Britain's recent formal recognition of the Czech provisional government and the conclusion of a new alliance agreement with Poland, although they are measures to increase combat strength, they also signify the revival of these two ill-fated national states. The ongoing Sino-Japanese War in the Far East is the greatest national movement of modern times, symbolizing independence, freedom, and justice, and waging a life-or-death struggle against oppression, enslavement, and aggression. The current international phenomenon, while superficially chaotic and obscure, making it difficult to grasp its mainstream, is nevertheless a situation in which the national question is acting as its soul.</p>
<p>Nationalism is something that came with modern capitalism. At the beginning of the 19th century, various weak nations began to awaken due to the upheavals of international economic and political evolution. Even the most reactionary Tsar Alexander of Russia is said to have been moved by the principle of national self-determination, stating: "God has chosen monarchs for the happiness and harmony of the people, and therefore they must not cede territory against the will and interests of the people." But the high tide of national movements was during the previous European War. The Austro-Hungarian Empire and the Turkish Empire both encountered the misfortune of division under this principle. What is regrettable is that the application of this principle at that time was not solely for the sake of the oppressed and to make it consistent with justice and fairness; instead, it often accommodated the intentions of the victorious powers, disregarding the will of certain nations. The Versailles Treaty system contained several seeds of disaster, and those related to the national question were the most obvious, leading to the annexation of Austria by Germany, the Sudetenland dispute, the Danzig issue, and the problems of ethnic minorities and territorial disputes regarding Poland, Romania, and Yugoslavia in recent years, all of which can be traced back to the outcome of the previous European War. As for the independence of the Baltic states, although it was voluntarily carried out by the Soviet Union, there were other international machinations involved. The Soviet Union's support for the principle of national self-determination was not unconditional, especially when such separatist movements contained anti-Soviet sentiments. Therefore, the outbreak of this European War and the recent turmoil in Europe all have their own historical causes and effects when viewed from the perspective of the national question. Now, Europe and the world map are about to be redrawn. Whether it can avoid repeating past mistakes and planting seeds of future disaster is the focus of greatest concern for people with a sense of justice.</p>
<p>Nationalism and national self-determination are both principles that should be praised. The reason they have turned into sources of various disasters is none other than their unfortunate intermingling with various adverse conditions. Therefore, a correct national movement must: first, be in accordance with the principles of justice and fairness and must not be mixed with other reactionary and base motives; second, the assistance of strong countries to weak nations should be out of genuine motives and should not be abused to achieve some unjust desires; third, weak nations themselves must not be eager for quick success and unscrupulous means, lest they fall into disaster unknowingly. Over the past decade, aggressors have used disguised national slogans in the international arena to carry out many conspiracies. Even China has suffered many tribulations as a result. But the measures taken by Nazi Germany against Austria, Czechoslovakia, and Poland, while their methods may be questionable, have not been without their rational basis in history, especially from a national point of view. These precedents should not be misused by the aggressors in the Far East.</p>
<p>Now, a new wave of national movements is being launched around the world. If the European War continues to spread, it is unknown how many more new problems will arise in succession. Will the results of these evolutions lay the foundation for the future era of happiness, or will they repeatedly bury seeds of endless disaster? It all depends on how these national movements develop. In other words, will they represent the promotion of justice and fairness, or will they cover up their ugly inner workings with national slogans? At this critical juncture, the most noteworthy point is that countries that aspire to promote genuine world peace, regardless of the complexity of their actual international relations, must be generous in providing assistance to those nations that are truly engaged in life-and-death struggles for justice and fairness. Only then can they prove that they are genuinely concerned about the future of the world and mankind. And the resisting China is such a touchstone that is universally effective.</p>
<h3 id="e19">Welles Meets with Soviet Ambassador; US and Soviet Union to Renew Trade Agreement; Japan Feels Threatened by US Restrictions; Prepares to Apply for Oil and Iron Export Permits <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>Washington: With the US-Soviet trade agreement expiring in ten days, US Under Secretary of State Welles met yesterday with Soviet Ambassador to the US, Oumansky, for preliminary talks on renewing the trade agreement. Welles acknowledged that he initiated the talks, leading to widespread speculation that the US is eager to renew the US-Soviet trade agreement and that Secretary of State Hull's principles have prevailed. Hull's principle is to maintain trade with all reserve countries even in times of turmoil. (International News Service dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Washington: Acting US Secretary of State Welles told reporters yesterday that the Maritime Commission's decision to allow the Soviet Union to charter oil tankers from the California Oil Company to transport gasoline to Vladivostok, while rejecting similar applications from Japan and Spain, does not involve a shift in US foreign policy. Welles stated that the Commission's actions were based entirely on the danger of transportation. Ships traveling to Spain or Japan would be forced to pass through hostile areas, while oil tankers traveling to Vladivostok would not encounter any acts of war along the way. The Japanese side here is deeply concerned about President Roosevelt's announcement of an embargo on the export of American aircraft gasoline, alkylate, scrap copper, and scrap iron to Japan, as well as the US government's granting of permission to Soviet companies to charter American oil tankers to transport gasoline to Vladivostok, and the prior rejection of similar applications from Japanese companies. On Friday, President Roosevelt firmly stated at a press conference that the US export licensing order was not directed against any particular country, but was intended to preserve US military raw materials related to strategy for US national defense purposes. Although President Roosevelt made this assurance, most diplomatic circles here acknowledge that the new export control measures are a tool to restrict the export of special raw materials to Europe and Asia. The Japanese side here believes that Japan can apply to the United States for export licenses on the day the order requiring export licenses takes effect on August 1st. If the US government refuses or restricts Japan's application, then President Roosevelt's order can be regarded as an embargo. It is believed that Welles and Japanese Ambassador to the US, Kensuke Horinouchi, discussed the President's order requiring export licenses and the actions of the Maritime Commission on Friday. (United Press dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Well-informed sources here say that the US placing oil and iron under a strict export licensing system is stimulating Japan's southward policy and is likely to encourage Japan to advance into the Dutch East Indies, as the Dutch East Indies are the second largest source of oil supply needed by Japan, and are rich in steel and other major raw materials. Some Japanese public law experts have advocated cutting off the US's supply of zinc and rubber from Southeast Asia in retaliation for the US's obstruction of Japan's handling of the "China Incident." Now, this proposal is indeed important, because the US is the largest supplier of oil and iron needed by Japan. Therefore, this blockade will be a major blow to Japan's military preparations and national production expansion plans. However, political circles say that Japan has long anticipated this move by the US, and it is not surprising that the US has restricted oil and iron. However, whether this order can be smoothly implemented is still a question, and the Japanese government has already made preparations to cope with this blockade of oil and iron. Japan has already purchased large quantities of oil and iron, and Japan has also considered developing China's iron mines as a countermeasure. (United Press dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Japanese Ambassador Refuses to Criticize; Will Not Protest to the US for the Time Being</p>
<p>Washington: Japanese Ambassador to the US, Kensuke Horinouchi, received an explanation from Acting Secretary of State Welles regarding the executive branch's extension of export controls to oil and scrap iron, which he then relayed to President Roosevelt. After visiting Welles, Horinouchi refused to comment on the impact of this measure on Japan when meeting with reporters. He said that he went to the State Department at Welles' request and was not there to make any statement at the instruction of Tokyo. He also said that he had not received any information from home regarding the reaction to the new US law. Observers believe that Horinouchi's statement indicates that Tokyo will not protest this move to the US for the time being. The Japanese side believes that the Japanese government will not decide on its opinion until this export control law is implemented. It is expected that this law will be tested in a few days, because the Japanese have purchased a large quantity of steel and scrap iron recently. If the US government implements an export permit system for Japan, then the facts revealed by this test will be beyond doubt. (United Press dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: After the US announced that the export of oil and scrap iron would require special licenses, people here were quite surprised. Political circles and newspapers alike believe that this ban will have a significant impact on Japan's interests. The Japanese Embassy in the US has already received instructions from the Japanese government to inquire about the US government's intentions regarding this issue. The "Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun" stated that if the US adopts a threatening attitude towards Japan, then the US should also prepare for Japan's strong resistance. Japan firmly believes that if the UK and the US are not forced to abandon their deeply entrenched policy of maintaining the status quo, then genuine international peace will be difficult to achieve. From Japan's point of view, if the imperialist forces of the UK and the US cannot be eliminated from East Asia, then the new order based on the principle of "Asia for Asians" cannot be established. The US has no close racial ties or other important relations with East Asia. As the national consciousness of Asians is increasingly developing, if the US tries to contain it, Japan will make effective resistance. And the US's suspension of exports will close the door to East Asia for the US. Japan's current actions must be based on the principle of "an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth," and the US should bear the responsibility for the implementation of this principle. The fate of the new East Asia will not be affected by US oil and iron. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 28th)</p>
<h3 id="e20">Soviet Navy Day: Naval Chief Delivers Speech – Strength Increased Threefold in Two Years; Determined to Protect Maritime Territory <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>Moscow – On Soviet Navy Day, Naval Commissar Kuznetsov delivered a speech stating, “In the past year, we have added thousands of miles to our borders in the Baltic, North Sea, and Black Sea. Militarily, these new borders are extremely important. The situation in the Baltic Sea has greatly changed. Two hundred years ago, the Russian Navy defeated the Swedish Navy in the Hanko and Erenta Peninsula areas. Currently, the Soviet fleet is once again stationed near the peninsula. At the same time, the Soviet Baltic Fleet is conducting exercises from Kronstadt to Liepāja. They will never give up their newly acquired defenses. The experience of the Second Imperialist War has deeply convinced us that a country along the coast must possess a combined naval, land, and air force to resist foreign aggression. Therefore, our naval power must be as strong as the land and air forces so that we can assist in defending the motherland when necessary. In 1940, our naval power increased by 50% compared to 1939. The rapid increase in naval power is due to the construction of giant ships. The development of our submarine fleet has been very rapid. The total number of new submarines this year will increase threefold compared to 1939. At the same time, there are many ships under construction that will join naval activities in recent years. The strength of the naval air force has also increased, and coastal defense is being improved. However, we still cannot consider it perfect. Some countries may be extremely envious of our new power, but in our view, this scale is not sufficient. With the rapid development of the navy, it is necessary to accelerate the training of personnel. Young people across the country are eager to study at naval schools, as evidenced by the number of applications. The Soviet People's Committee has ordered the establishment of specialized schools in seven cities to allow students to study naval discipline before entering naval academies. It is said that all senior high school students in the designated seven cities will apply to naval academies. The Soviet people deeply love the Red Army and Navy and do their best to strengthen the combat power of the Red Army and Navy. In addition, figures such as Stalin, Molotov, Voroshilov, and Zhetnov are also very concerned about the navy. Therefore, our Soviet Navy believes that reliable guarantees have been obtained regarding the implementation of the tasks given by the Party and government.” (TASS dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Moscow – Soviet Naval Commissar Admiral Kuznetsov delivered a speech last night on the eve of Navy Day, praising the expansion of the Soviet army last year. He stated that the Soviet Union added a total of 112 warships last year, many of which were torpedo boats. In 1940, the Soviet Union added another 186 warships. In total, the Soviet Navy's tonnage has increased threefold in the past two years. Discussing the experience of the current European war, he believes that strong countries must have strong naval, land, and air forces. For example, Britain's air and land forces are inferior to Germany, and despite its strong navy, it has suffered repeated setbacks. (Haitong dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Moscow – The "Red Fleet" newspaper commented on Soviet Navy Day, stating, "Our navy is becoming increasingly powerful. Under Stalin's guidance, a great naval construction plan is being implemented. During this third Five-Year Plan period, the development of our country's naval power has entered a new stage. Our current warships, large and small, are in no way inferior to those of any major power. In 1939, the ships supplied to the navy by our shipbuilding industry increased threefold compared to 1938. The shipbuilding industry is currently planning that by 1942-43, the Soviet Union's shipbuilding output will rank first in the world." In addition, Landekin, a key member of the Soviet Shipbuilding Industry Committee, wrote in the Izvestia newspaper today, "Our shipbuilding industry is now capable of building extremely excellent submarines. The current Soviet submarine fleet is not only not inferior to any major power but has also surpassed the submarine fleets of leading capitalist countries. In 1938, the number of submarines manufactured by the Soviet Union increased by fifteen times compared to 1937." (TASS dispatch, 28th)</p>

<p>Hong Kong – Tokyo dispatch: The Konoe Cabinet decided on the basic national policy outline on the 25th. The Imperial Headquarters and Cabinet Liaison Conference will be held on the morning of the 27th to discuss the basic national policy. It will be resolved according to the original plan. Konoe will present it to the Emperor at noon on the 27th and then convene the cabinet in the afternoon to report the results of the Liaison Conference. It is said that Konoe will publish the publicly available parts of the basic national policy outline in the form of a government statement or near-future talk in the middle of next week. However, the so-called outline is mostly a principle and tends to be too abstract. Therefore, Konoe also intends to publish a concrete implementation plan for several of the principles at the same time to show the government's determination to implement them. The main content of the outline is as follows: (1) Fundamental policy: Implement Japan's ideals and build a Greater East Asia. The so-called Greater East Asia includes the South Seas, Thailand, India, Burma, and Annam. (2) Strengthen national defense. (3) Revamp diplomacy, strengthen the relationship with the German-Italian-Japanese Axis, and actively adjust diplomacy with the United States, the Soviet Union, and other countries. (4) In order to establish a new national defense state, a new political system and a new economic system should be established immediately to establish a Greater East Asia economic sphere and prepare a self-sufficient economic system to avoid dependence on foreign countries. (5) Revamp education. (6) Revitalize science. (7) Strengthen and expand human resources. (Dispatch of the 28th)</p>

<p>Chongqing – A spokesman for the Military Affairs Commission stated that the battles in the coastal areas of Zhejiang and Fujian were the most intense in the past week. Under the fierce counterattack of the heroic Chinese soldiers, the Japanese who were eager to move have been driven to collapse. Their exaggerated propaganda and the so-called "strengthening of the blockade" have been completely shattered by China. At a time when the new Japanese cabinet has just been established, the Japanese army has suffered a major blow, which shows that their collapse is not far off. The most important details of the battle are as follows:</p>
<p>Zhejiang and Fujian</p>
<p>The Japanese troops who invaded Zhenhai and its vicinity in Zhejiang were completely surrounded by the Chinese army on the 19th. That night, the Chinese army began a counteroffensive. The Chinese soldiers charged into battle, advancing without retreating. By the evening of the 21st, they had successively recovered all the important strongholds. In the Battle of Qijiao Mountain, the Japanese and Chinese armies fought fiercely. The Chinese army fought more and more bravely and finally captured the mountain. The loss of this important shield shook the Japanese army. After a day and night of fierce attack by the Chinese army, they recovered Zhenhai the next morning. The defeated Japanese fled, and after a victorious pursuit, few Japanese warships survived. That morning, the Chinese army on the left bank of the Yong River launched a fierce mopping-up operation, completely clearing out the Japanese troops. As for the Japanese troops who landed and invaded Yongning, Xiangwu, Sandu, and other places in Fujian, they had completely retreated in defeat by the 21st, suffering heavy losses.</p>
<p>Hubei and Hunan</p>
<p>In Hubei, the Chinese army's offensive on the east bank of the Fu River has been very successful in the past week. One unit attacked the Japanese troops in Suixian on the night of the 22nd and bombarded them with artillery fire. A fire broke out in the city, and the Japanese troops fled outside the city, where countless were killed by the Chinese army. Another unit attacked Zhongxiang on the morning of the 21st, and all the Japanese soldiers guarding Xihu Mountain in the northeast were wiped out by the Chinese army. Subsequently, the Japanese reinforced from Yangzi and counterattacked. The Chinese army engaged them in a fierce battle for half a day, killing many Japanese. As for the Japanese strongholds in the Linxiang and Yueyang areas of northern Hunan, after the Chinese army recovered many places, the Japanese suffered heavy casualties and are now unable to move. The railways and highways in the area have been destroyed everywhere by the Chinese army, and transportation has been interrupted. At the moment, China is taking advantage of the victory to continue expanding its gains.</p>
<p>Shanxi and Henan</p>
<p>The Chinese army in southern Shanxi attacked the Japanese troops near Yangcheng, Gaoping, and other counties, capturing many. The highway between Jincheng and Gaoping was completely destroyed. In addition, the Japanese army has gathered more than 4,000 troops from various counties in southern Fen and launched a large-scale offensive on Jiwang Mountain. After the Chinese army bravely encircled and attacked them in a bloody battle for four days and nights, they killed more than a thousand and recovered many strongholds. The defeated Japanese fled in different directions, and the pursuit is still fiercely underway. As for the Chinese army in eastern Henan, the mopping-up operation against the remnants of the Japanese army on the border between Henan and Anhui has also been very successful. Countless weapons, ammunition, and supplies have been seized.</p>
<p>Shandong and Jiangsu</p>
<p>The Japanese army in Shandong was extremely panicked after Zhao Yikang led more than 5,000 troops to defect. In order to prevent a large-scale offensive by the Chinese army, they gathered more than 1,000 infantry, cavalry, and artillery and invaded south along the Anju Highway from Weixian via Anqiu. They were met with a head-on blow by the Chinese army, killing many Japanese. At the moment, the Chinese army is fiercely attacking on one side and advancing towards the rear of the Japanese army on the other, carrying out a pincer attack. There have also been battles in Boshan, Yangning, Laiwu, and other places, where the Japanese army has suffered heavy losses. The battles in northern Jiangsu are more intense in Huaian, Huaiyin, Baoying, and other places. Under the head-on blow of the Chinese army, the invading Japanese troops on all fronts have been surrounded separately, and a heroic annihilation battle is underway. In addition:</p>
<p>Guangxi</p>
<p>The Chinese army has launched fierce attacks on the Japanese troops on the Yongqin and Yonglong routes, killing many. In Shenzhen in southern Guangdong and Qiongan in eastern Guangdong, the Japanese army has launched incessant offensives but has been repulsed, abandoning many corpses, weapons, and ammunition.</p>

<p>London – Nothing is yet known about the scope or nature of the talks in Berchtesgaden and Rome. However, according to a Reuter's diplomatic correspondent, all current indications are that Germany intends to improve understanding between Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria to increase economic output, especially to achieve political peace so that Germany can concentrate its efforts on the Western war and develop plans for exploiting the occupied areas without any worries about the rear. The gradual rapprochement between Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union is a notable fact in recent times. The Soviet Union's attitude towards the above developments is still unclear. It can be asserted that any German action to gain a foothold in the Black Sea will immediately provoke Soviet opposition. However, at present, the Soviet Union seems unlikely to take any action other than paying very close attention to the Axis powers' actions to maintain peace and promote their economic interests in the Balkans. (Reuter's dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Bucharest – Local well-informed sources stated yesterday that the increasing friction between Germany and the Soviet Union in the Balkans is very reliable. Local reports confirm that German troops are now being transported by ships to the German New Eastern Front, which borders the Soviet Union. An official newspaper published an order yesterday stating that former Romanian Foreign Minister Gavencu has been appointed as the envoy to the Soviet Union and will arrive in Moscow on August 10. Gavencu's appointment is considered quite important because the Balkan Conference is currently being held in Salzburg and Rome. It is believed that Gavencu will bring Hitler's reorganization plan for the economy and politics of Southeastern Europe to Moscow. According to United Press International sources from Soviet personnel, the final border allocation between Germany and the Soviet Union will be completed before embassies are exchanged between Berlin, Rome, Moscow, and Bucharest. German commentators on the movement of German troops said that the movement of German troops to the east border has not reached the level of concentration. They did not pay great attention to this movement, but said that they should place the troops used in the Belgian and French battles in new camps. At the same time, reliable sources said that the Minister of Interior has issued a notice ordering the Jews who withdrew from Bessarabia due to the Soviet Union's entry to return to the area within five days. It is believed that this notice is suddenly used for wealthy Jewish people who escaped in cars when the Soviet army entered. It is believed that the government has decided to detain more than 200 Jewish people and communists in the Mălăncrav concentration camp for national security reasons. The camp was previously a detention center for Iron Guard leaders. (United Press dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Berlin – Political figures here are very interested in the negotiations in Salzburg. However, official figures are absolutely silent because diplomatic authorities are all in southern Germany. Newspapers believe that Germany's interests in the Balkan Peninsula are purely economic and hope that Southeastern Europe will maintain peace. A diplomatic correspondent for the "People's Observer" stated that the Balkan countries should now build a new order and maintain a stable state to establish a foundation for prosperity. The countries must obtain a stable political position and a sound economic position in the New Europe. The "General Report" stated that Western European countries hope that the Southeastern European countries will become a source of unrest, while Germany and Italy wish that the Southeastern European countries maintain peace and resolve all disputes based on justice and common sense. The "Berlin Local Daily" stated that political peace is a prerequisite for maintaining Germany's economic relations with the Southeastern European countries. (Haitong dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>German, Bulgarian, Italian, and Romanian Talks Conclude – Romania Will Eventually Cede Territory to Bulgaria and Hungary</p>
<p>London – There has been intense diplomatic activity in Berchtesgaden, Salzburg, and Rome in the past 24 hours. It is expected that the result will be that Romania will cede Outer Transylvania to Hungary and part of Dobruja to Bulgaria. After Hitler spoke with the Romanian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister on Friday afternoon, he met with the Hungarian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister at his country residence for more than two hours last night. At the same time, in Rome, Mussolini received the Romanian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister at the Venezia Palace. Italian Foreign Minister Ciano was also present. The talks lasted more than an hour and a half. The Romanian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister left Rome at 11:00 last night and returned home. People in Berlin and Rome firmly believe that the result of these talks will be that Romania will cede Outer Transylvania and part of Dobruja. (Reuter's dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Berchtesgaden – Yesterday afternoon, Hitler received Bulgarian Prime Minister Filov and Foreign Minister Popov. Foreign Minister Ribbentrop was also present. The issue of the New Order in Southeastern Europe was discussed for about two hours in the same place where he had talked with Romanian politicians the previous day. According to Bulgarian newspapers, Bulgaria proposed to Hitler that Romania return Southern Dobruja, which was annexed in 1913. Although the details of the talks are unknown, well-informed sources said that the discussion was completely in the spirit of friendship, which Germany and Bulgaria have maintained since the World War. Afterwards, a tea party was held, and the Bulgarian Prime Minister introduced his entourage to Mr. Hitler. While Ribbentrop was talking with Mr. Hitler, the Bulgarian Prime Minister, accompanied by the Bulgarian envoy to Germany, the director of the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the German envoy to Bulgaria, drove to Salzburg. The Bulgarian Prime Minister and others left here at 7:30 last night and returned to Sofia via Vienna. (Haitong dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Berlin – Yesterday, the Essen National Daily published an article criticizing the visit of politicians from the Balkan countries to Germany, stating that the German side deeply sympathizes with the requests of Hungary, Bulgaria, and Turkey to modify their territories because the requests are very reasonable. Southern Dobruja was originally an important area for Bulgaria's livelihood. As for Hungary, it must give up some of its hopes because the land disputed by Hungary and Romania is far greater than that disputed by Bulgaria and Romania. In addition, the historical development should also impose considerable restrictions on Hungary's requests. At present, it is an era of self-determination for minorities and cannot be compared with the ancient concepts of empires. Hungary knows that it must retreat, and Romania also knows that it has been unfair to Hungary. Therefore, in order to maintain peace between the two countries, both sides must make concessions to each other. (Haitong dispatch, 28th)</p>

<p>London – British aircraft demonstrated their amazing striking power again yesterday, flying over German military targets day and night in adverse weather. The cities of Sheeble and Valhaven in the Netherlands, Cherbourg and Saint-Nazaire and South End in France, and Dortmund and Hamm in Germany all heard the sound of British aircraft and were accurately bombed. According to the Information Office of the Ministry of Aviation, the White Han-style aircraft of the Coastal Command flew to Cherbourg in adverse weather and dropped many giant bombs and incendiary bombs on the German oil depot. The oil depot was hit and caught fire. A large British bomber also flew to the mouth of the Loire River to bomb the oil refinery and oil storage depot controlled by the Germans, causing heavy damage. The main targets of the British aircraft were five oil refineries and oil storage depots in South End and three oil storage tanks in Saint-Nazaire, with a total storage capacity of 142,000 tons. Targets in both places were found by British aircraft shortly after midnight. Ground defenses strongly resisted. The British aircraft dropped tons of high-explosive bombs and hundreds of small incendiary bombs in batches, hitting the targets and exploding successively. Only black smoke and fierce fires were seen. Other British bombers attacked the Hamm railway line and important power stations again. The power stations in Dortmund and the airfields in Sheeble and Valhaven were also bombed. Yesterday, British aircraft attacked during the day without any losses, but one night raider did not return.

(Reuters dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>London: The House of Commons is scheduled to hold a closed-door session on the 30th of this month to discuss foreign policy issues. Prime Minister Churchill will deliver a comprehensive speech at that time, providing a detailed report on recent developments in the international situation. It has been observed that Chancellor Hitler's planned "offensive" against Britain has evidently slowed down, and diplomatic authorities in various European countries have been very active over the past week. Therefore, political observers here are placing great importance on the upcoming closed-door session of the House of Commons, believing that a detailed review of the "political dynamics in Southeast European countries" will be conducted. Furthermore, one matter is particularly noteworthy: recently, Britain has shown increasing favor towards the Soviet Union. This is a crucial factor in world politics. For example, regarding Bulgaria's demand to Romania for the return of the Dobruja region, Britain and the Soviet Union have "identical views" and are supporting Bulgaria. This clearly demonstrates Britain's eagerness to get closer to the Soviet Union in order to resist Germany's efforts in Southeast Europe. In addition, British officials insist that recent diplomatic activities in various European countries are completely unrelated to Hitler's recent "peace appeals" and should not be confused.

<h3 id="e45">Pan-American Small Group Committee - Unanimously Drafts Agreement - Reaffirms Right to Self-Determination of Western Hemisphere Territories - Submitted to the Committee for the Maintenance of Peace for Approval <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>Havana: The small group committee composed of representatives from the United States, Cuba, Argentina, Brazil, and Panama at the Pan-American Conference has reached an agreement after much discussion and drafted an agreement to be submitted to the Committee for the Maintenance of Peace for approval. The agreement reiterates the right to self-determination of European countries in the Western Hemisphere and declares that the American republics have the right to prevent possible transfers of such land to other countries in order to protect their own nations. It is said that the agreement also contains a convention and regulations for establishing an agency to put the "Havana Declaration" into effect, and a resolution to establish an emergency committee to deal with any situation that may arise before the permanent agency is established. The agreement first focuses on the proposal put forward by the United States regarding the custody of such territories, and contains the demands put forward by Argentina, advocating that any action on any colony should first be discussed with the people of that territory. It also lists the proposals put forward by Brazil and Cuba, advocating the establishment of an agency so that any colony can take immediate action if there is a risk of transfer to another country. The convention referred to must be approved by the parliaments of several countries in accordance with their constitutions. The Falkland Islands are not recognized as having colonial status, so they are not handled in accordance with the joint custody system for other colonies. Argentina has requested special rights to the Falkland Islands. The Neutrality Committee of the Conference yesterday passed a resolution proposed by the United States to prevent the activities of the Fifth Column, which stipulates the exchange of information on destructive activities, restricts the rights of diplomatic envoys, and does not allow foreign embassies to have a large number of staff or officials with diplomatic status. If the sovereignty of any country is threatened by such destructive activities, and the government of that country applies for assistance, then all countries should take joint action. The Committee for the Maintenance of Peace has agreed that if the 21 republics have not yet made a decision on the convention, a standing committee should be organized by the five American countries to guide all actions taken to implement the custody of threatened colonies of European countries in the Americas. This is one of the key points of contention, as several countries have argued that the committee should be composed of representatives from 21 countries. The three-point procedure aimed at avoiding the transfer of colonies will be approved by the Committee for the Maintenance of Peace at its next plenary session. It is now believed that the proposal put forward by Uruguay to limit the territorial waters to 25 miles is expected to pass. The plan will be implemented after this war. The current international law stipulates a territorial waters limit of only three miles. The proposal put forward by Guatemala, arguing that if the United Kingdom makes any changes to the legal status of British Honduras, then Guatemala should take over the administrative power of the territory, is currently being considered by the Committee for the Maintenance of Peace. It stipulates that Guatemala should continue to govern the territory until it returns to normal. Honduras argues that the colony should be considered by an arbitration court. The Guatemala proposal has not yet been put to a vote, but according to responsible sources here, British Honduras will be included in the general action plan for all colonies.

<p>Havana: Dr. Miro, the Argentine representative at the Pan-American Conference, has fully endorsed the plan to prevent countries in the Western Hemisphere from being transferred to others as a result of the European war. This undertaking has been confirmed by U.S. Secretary of State Hull yesterday. This is the greatest victory of American diplomacy in recent times, as the plan created by Washington's strategists seems to have been accepted by the American republics. Although the details of the colonial plan have not been revealed, it is said to be very similar to the Pan-American joint control proposed by the United States for any colony in distress. When the Argentine representative announced his satisfaction, an optimistic atmosphere filled the conference. People generally hope that the conference can quickly implement this procedure to its completion, so that the Western Hemisphere has a detailed and practical procedure to resist totalitarian countries.

<p>Washington: U.S. Acting Secretary of State Welles told reporters yesterday that the United States has not received a request from the French government for the United States to declare its attitude towards French territories in the Western Hemisphere, especially if French colonies are attacked by non-American powers. Welles said that the U.S. policy regarding European countries' territories in the Western Hemisphere is well known and has recently been clarified again. He believes that it is unnecessary for France to make a request to the United States. Welles said in response to questions that he has discussed the general issues of French territories, including Martinique, with the French ambassador on several occasions, but they have no intention of making any further statements at this time.

<h3 id="e47">Nine British Nationals Arrested in Japan - No Announcement from Japanese Authorities After Cox's Detention <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>Local News: According to Reuters, nine more British nationals were arrested in Japan at the end of last week. Together with Cox, the agency's Tokyo correspondent who was arrested yesterday, there are now ten people. The names of the nine people are as follows: (1) Colonel James, representative of the British Industrial Federation in Japan (Tokyo); (2) Holt, President of the British Association (Kobe); (3) Truman of Fretcher Company (Kobe); (4) James of Cameron Company (Kobe); (5) Jones of Nickel Lyon Company (Kobe); (6) British merchant and Honorary Consul of Greece, Macnorton (Osaka); (7) James of Nickel Lyon Company (Osaka); (8) Lindger (Shimonoseki); (9) Lindger (Nagasaki, brother of the above-mentioned Lin Min). News of the arrests of all the above-mentioned people has not been allowed to be published in Japanese newspapers and is forbidden from being transmitted overseas. It is said that these arrests were carried out simultaneously in various parts of Japan, so this unexpected incident appears to be an organized action. (Reuters) Local News: Reuters has learned that, as of yesterday afternoon, there has been no announcement from the Japanese authorities regarding the detention of the agency's Tokyo correspondent, Cox, by the Japanese military police. It is also not allowed to send telegrams from Japan about this matter. It is said that staff from the British consulate in Tokyo visited Cox the day before yesterday afternoon, but permission was not granted. However, he was provided with adequate food. Reuters in Shanghai has received many letters and telegrams expressing sympathy for Cox's detention. Most of them were sent by people who knew Cox, who all said that Cox was upright and honest and that this detention must be due to a misunderstanding. (Reuters)</p>

<p>Geneva: Part of the resignation letter of former League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol was revealed today. Avenol stated that until September 1939, he still believed that the League of Nations could at least carry out minimal activities. Unfortunately, the position of the League of Nations was declining day by day. He suggested establishing an economic and social issues committee, and stated that non-members of the League of Nations could also cooperate with the committee, but his plan was not successful. Therefore, the activities of the Secretariat of the League of Nations had to take into account the reduction of the League of Nations' economic power and seek ways to adapt to it. The General Assembly of the League of Nations allowed him to make flexible arrangements, but his efforts had no support, so he submitted his resignation. (Haitong dispatch, 28th)</p>

<p>Berlin: During this week, the world paid attention to Hitler's speech on July 19 and its repercussions. Britain has now declared that it wants to continue the war, but it cannot be said that the outcome of the war is favorable to Britain. Britain has admitted the possibility of German troops landing on the British Isles and told the world that a kind of Maginot Line and solid gun emplacements have been built along the coast, but we know that this cannot be built in a few weeks. The number of British troops on the island is also limited. The last time British troops came to France, there were only ten divisions, and their artillery and tanks were the best, but they were abandoned on the battlefield when they fled back. It is not easy to replenish these armaments now, and it is difficult for the frightened army to restore its combat power. It is a big mistake to think that time is on Britain's side. Germany is getting stronger every day, and Britain is gradually weakening due to the German blockade. The tonnage lost by British ships every day is about 30,000 tons. The number reached 95,000 tons on July 25. The record of one million tons during the World War will soon be reached. Britain now has to lay mines in the waterways of the Thumberston and St. George's Channel and use the sea line of Northern Ireland to connect the seaports of the Irish Sea. The British Navy has lost about 40% of its ships, so its Far East fleet has to be recalled. Only a small part of the escort ships are available, and most of them must be prepared for the final decisive battle. The situation of the British Navy in the Mediterranean is even worse. French ports are no longer used by Britain. Malta is attacked by Italy every day. Gibraltar and Haifa ports have been heavily bombed. It is even more unbelievable if Britain declares that the counter-offensive is ready, because the problem of the British supreme commander has not yet been resolved.</p>
<p>Berlin: According to a military expert who gave a supplementary war report to a Haitong agency reporter, German submarines sank 65,000 tons of enemy ships. British merchant ships have suffered many losses recently, and the supply of food and raw materials is becoming increasingly difficult. Transport ships have to travel a long way, so they feel even more lacking. The German Air Force continues to bomb in bad weather, and the oil storage facilities at the mouth of the Thames River have also been attacked. (Haitong dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Berlin: According to Haitong Agency reporter, Rear Admiral Burke Fefe stated that there are currently three facts about the naval situation: (1) Although Britain has suffered heavy losses, it continues to use warships to escort transport ships in the Strait of Dover; (2) German small submarines have been constantly victorious in commercial warfare; (3) Britain has blockaded St. George's Channel and Bristol Channel. Although Britain has suffered heavy losses in the ports of the southern coast and the Thames River, it still sends fleets to escort transport ships there instead of diverting to the western coast. There are three reasons for this: (a) According to the statistics of 1937, the import and export goods of the Thames ports reached 32,000,000 tons, while Southampton reached 13,800,000 tons, and Laithers reached 6,100,000 tons, totaling 20,000,000 tons, accounting for 44% of the total trade of all British seaports. Such a huge amount of goods cannot be transferred to other ports at will, as there is a lack of sufficient loading and unloading equipment. (b) Goods passing through a long distance must have special storage methods. This is most convenient in the Thames River port recently. (c) Due to the distribution of the British population, the consumption of daily necessities must also be more convenient through certain routes. The Qin River port is also one of the most convenient routes. Secondly, the greatest victory of German submarines in commercial warfare can be seen from the feat of sinking 160,000 tons of British ships with seven submarines. The third point is that after the British government closed the St. George's Channel and Bristol Channel, the shipping in the Irish Sea can only come from Northern Ireland.

<h3 id="e53">Developing Kaiyuan <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>Kunming Correspondence: Kaiyuan, formerly known as Ami Prefecture in the Qing Dynasty, is located at the center of the Chinese section of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway. Anyone entering or leaving Yunnan must pass through this place. Because the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway does not operate at night, passengers taking slow trains all disembark here to stay overnight. As a result, merchants gather, and the market is prosperous, truly making it an important town in southern Yunnan. Recently, the number of overseas Chinese returning to China has been increasing daily. The Yunnan Provincial Government has designated Kaiyuan as one of the overseas Chinese settlement areas. Kaiyuan has fertile land, abundant resources, and a subtropical climate. If the returning overseas Chinese can work diligently and in a pioneering spirit to develop it, its future is immeasurable. However, overseas Chinese have been abroad for a long time and have become somewhat estranged from the interior. Moreover, Kaiyuan is remotely located in southern Yunnan and has not been noticed by people, so few dare to come rashly. I am writing a general overview of the area for reference, which may provide some help to those who aspire to come to Yunnan for cultivation.</p>
<p>Waiting to be Developed</p>
<p>After getting off the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway train, you arrive at Luoyunzhuang, a town outside the county seat. The streets are clean and tidy, with trees lining both sides. There are hotels opened by Cantonese people, such as Guangfulong Inn and Dadong Inn. Other small department stores and Cantonese goods stores are also operated by Cantonese people. There are also several Western restaurants, mostly opened by Annamese people, who also speak Cantonese. Near the station, there is a hotel opened by the French, but the accommodation costs are calculated in Vietnamese currency, which is uneconomical. Traveling north for a little over a mile, you reach the county seat. The streets inside the city are relatively poor. In terms of education, in addition to the county-run schools, there are the provincial Kaiyuan Agricultural School and the Public Education Center. The location is quiet, and the decorations are colorful, leaving visitors with a good impression.</p>
<p>Propagating</p>
<p>Kaiyuan County as a whole is rectangular in shape. The Yunnan-Vietnam Railway runs vertically through the center of the plain, dividing Kaiyuan into eastern and western parts. The county's area extends approximately 130 kilometers from south to north and is about 90 kilometers wide from east to west. The central part is a plain, while the southeastern part is mostly mountainous, especially the eastern part. The plains of the entire county are separated by the eastern mountains, causing differences in climate. The highest mountain is Dongshan. To its east is the Jiayiba Plain, bordering Wenshan County, with 150,000 mu of arable land. However, only slightly more than 50,000 mu have been cultivated. Jiayiba is further divided into Dajiayi and Xiaojiayi. The soil is fertile, but unfortunately, water conservancy was not properly maintained in the past, so land yields cannot be compared with other places. The Yunnan Department of Finance has now established the "Kaiwen Reclamation Bureau" there to construct water conservancy projects and guide the public in reclamation efforts. Once the water conservancy of Jiayiba is improved, all the fields can be irrigated. This area alone can reclaim 100,000 to 150,000 mu of good farmland.</p>
<p>Repairing Water Conservancy</p>
<p>The fields of Jiayiba can be planted twice a year, with broad beans in the spring and rice in the summer. The soil in the central part of the plain has more moisture and is suitable for planting sugarcane. Therefore, the sugar produced there is abundant in yield and excellent in quality, surpassing the entire county. The Kaiwen Reclamation Bureau plans to build a dam at Guanyin Temple in the short term to store water for irrigation. The first phase will reclaim 40,000 mu, followed by two more phases to turn all the public and private wasteland into cultivated land. To the west of the mountains is the Wucheng Plain, with a slightly warmer climate than the eastern part, and the water conservancy is also better than the eastern plain. However, only the Xiba River irrigates all the fields. The river's capacity is not large, and the construction is not strong, so there is always the danger of collapse. However, nothing seems to be wrong at the moment. The wise authorities have probably already noticed and may undertake repairs in the future. The entire county currently has about 500,000 mu of arable land, with mountainous land accounting for about one-third, and the rest being fertile land in the plains. Due to water conservancy issues, only one-fifth has been cultivated, so water conservancy is crucial for the county. The county's political divisions consist of six districts and two towns, with an estimated population of over 10,000 households. According to a survey by the county government at the end of 1939, there are approximately 100,000 male and female residents. Apart from the area near the county seat, the vicinity of Dongshan is mostly inhabited by a mix of Miao and Yi people, with extremely complex ethnic groups, including White Miao, Minjia, Bai Yi, and Yeren, among others. The customs near the county seat are simple and honest. Kaiyuan has abundant labor and is still diligent and hardworking. The daily wage for each worker is about 80 cents in national currency, which is much cheaper than in Kunming.</p>
<p>Abundant Products</p>
<p>Kaiyuan is located in southern Yunnan, with a climate almost subtropical. Rainfall is abundant, with no snow throughout the year, and very little frost. The climate remains warm in winter, making it suitable for various crops, and the yields are abundant. For example, the yield per mu in the Jiayi Plain is no less than that of the top-grade fields in Yiliang County, a rich producing area of Yunnan Province. Furthermore, due to weather conditions, crops that are not suitable for planting in other prefectures and counties, such as tropical bananas, kapok, soybeans, and sugarcane, can also be planted in this county, and the yields are particularly abundant, unmatched elsewhere. Taking sugarcane as an example, the output from the Buyanba district alone is equal to the output of any other county. According to tax bureau statistics, the annual income from sugar sales in this district is approximately 2.9 million national currency. Farmers are often poor, partly due to a lack of capital and partly due to adherence to old methods, resulting in poor quality products. If improvements can be made, the production and sales are immeasurable.</p>
<p>Developed Cotton Industry</p>
<p>In addition to agricultural products, there are also abundant deposits of coal and iron. Digging into the soil reveals them. The quality and abundance are unmatched elsewhere. However, the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway has high freight rates and inconvenient transportation. Therefore, apart from supplying neighboring counties for fuel, it is not possible to transport and sell them in large quantities. It should be known that goods are abandoned on the ground due to the lack of transportation methods, ultimately being left unused. If funds can be raised for large-scale transportation and sales, it will also be a profitable business. Other agricultural products such as rice, potatoes, tobacco, fava beans, and cotton are also abundant in the county. Cotton accounts for one-seventh of the total in Yunnan Province. According to last year's survey, the province's cotton production was 6 million catties, with the county producing over 800,000 catties. In addition, there is also kapok, a specialty of the county. In the past, farmers did not pay attention to it, and very little was planted. Two years ago, under the advocacy of cotton experts, it began to attract the attention of cotton farmers. Now, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Fudian Bank have jointly organized a loan group to provide loans to cotton farmers and encourage planting, so that this special resource can be developed for production. There are already 1,175 mu of kapok planted in Kaiyuan. Further expansion in the future will be a great source of wealth. It is expected that in the near future, the cotton industry in Kaiyuan will have greater development. In addition to this, there are several types of handicrafts, such as weaving and noodles. Since the operators are all small-scale, they have not been able to fully develop. Animal husbandry and weaving straw mats are well-known rural side occupations in the county. If investments are made for large-scale production, the future is also promising.</p>
<p>Establishing a Large Power Plant</p>
<p>Because the county is centrally located and rich in production, the Yunnan Provincial Department of Finance, to develop the county and strengthen the rear, has raised funds to establish a power plant for the Yunnan Mining Company. Construction began three years ago and is nearing completion, making it one of Yunnan Province's major projects. The plant is located near a certain place and uses a certain river water as power. Once completed, it can generate 10,000 kilowatts, which will supply electricity for the mining of Gejiu tin mines and smelting by the mining company. The surplus electricity will be used for lighting in Kaiyuan, and the rest will be used for burning and refining cement and coal. Therefore, before the hydroelectric power plant is completed, the Department of Finance plans to build a cement plant and a coal plant near a certain place. This great project can not only absorb the labor force in the rear but also recover many concessions and reduce the outflow of foreign exchange. Kaiyuan is indeed a place extremely suitable for investment and development. Overseas Chinese who are interested in returning to China to start businesses may wish to visit and investigate, pool capital, and engage in development. This will not only benefit individuals but also greatly benefit the country.</p>
<p>Moscow, this morning at 8:08 (Moscow time), Soviet female pilots Nastorenko, Mikhailova, and Rosagova, departed from Boli on the "Ukraine" aircraft for a non-stop flight from Boli to Lvov. General Stan and Zihalev were present to see them off. At 5:32 PM, the aircraft passed Dashi (Eastern Siberia), and at 8:20 PM, it reached 150 kilometers north of Novosbirsk. The aircraft is still in radio contact with us. After passing Dashi, the aircraft began its night flight. Currently, the crew is safe, and everything is going smoothly.

<h3 id="e54">Soviet Female Pilots Fly Non-Stop Chongqing's Air Defense Air Raid Alarms are Deep Air Raid Shelters are Warm in Winter and Cool in Summer <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing Correspondence: Air raids in Chongqing often occur at night. According to reports, the loss rate for Japanese aircraft during daytime air raids is about 4%, while it is only about 1.6% at night. Approximately from the 7th or 8th to the 22nd or 23rd, it is the period of night raids, especially around the middle of the month.</p>
<p>Before an air raid alarm, officials often release news that Japanese aircraft have reached Yichang or Wanxian, which is called "news." After the news is released, women and children rush to carry clothes and anti-air raid stools (canvas stools used by cobblers), fleeing to nearby air raid shelters. Now, the Air Defense Command raises a red ball high up as soon as there is news. During an air raid alarm, another ball is added. During an emergency alarm, both balls are removed. During an emergency alarm, if the enemy aircraft are still far away, one ball is hung up. If they are even farther away, two balls are hung up. As they approach, one ball is removed. As they get closer, the other ball is also removed. When the alarm is lifted, a green ball is hung up.</p>
<p>Chongqing is a natural air defense city. The city is full of high mountains. Now, all the air raid shelters can almost accommodate the entire city's population. During air raids, anyone caught stealing will be shot, so property is very safe.</p>
<p>Outside the air raid shelters, there are often two or three vendors selling peanuts, boiled water, and Liangfen (mung bean jelly). There are also vendors selling loquats and apricots.</p>
<p>Poor people who seek shelter in the shelters bring bedding to use as pillows when sleeping in the shelters. Those who are slightly wealthier also bring small suitcases. The children in the shelters mostly do not sleep or cry, probably because they understand the seriousness of the situation and have experienced it many times.</p>
<p>Inside the air raid shelters, there are two rows of wooden benches on both sides. The empty space in the middle can accommodate two people standing side by side. The air is quite fresh, and it is warm in winter and cool in summer. Women, children, and timid men often rush in to grab seats after an air raid alarm. People who arrive calmly after an emergency alarm often sit on the stone steps outside the shelter because the lights illuminating the path inside the entrance have been turned off.</p>
<p>Inside the shelter, some people are dozing or sleeping. Only a few oil lamps are lit in the shelter. Some students are reading with a candle. This could earn them the nickname "Air Raid Scholar." There are also people reading during daytime air raids in the shelter. Therefore, Chongqing's experience with air raid alarms is very deep. It can truly be said that they have "personally experienced a hundred alarms."</p>

<h3 id="e55">Based on Agreement and Legal Principles, Shanghai Courts Cannot be Changed Concessions are Internationally Neutral Zones, Courts are Not Permitted by the Situation <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>The agreement to establish Chinese courts in the Public Concession is based on the agreement signed on February 17, 1930, by the Chinese representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the ministers of Brazil, the United States, Britain, Norway, the Netherlands, and France. It has the nature of a treaty. Without negotiation by national representatives, this agreement cannot be changed. Recently, certain parties have been actively attempting to seize the Chinese courts established in the concession. According to Japanese spokesman Ken Tsurumi, "The court issue will have new developments in the near future." A reporter from the Heiminsha News Agency immediately inquired with a jurist about this matter. According to his opinion:</p>
<p>Not an Occupied Area, No Right to Proceed</p>
<p>The negotiation of this matter should be conducted by the Minister of Foreign Affairs representing the country and the ministers of the countries that signed the agreement in order to be effective. Although the Japanese army has temporarily occupied the outskirts of Shanghai militarily, the concession is an internationally neutral zone and cannot be regarded as an occupied area. The Japanese army cannot conduct negotiations. The Nanjing organization has not only not been recognized by various countries, but Japan has not yet recognized it, and it has no standing to conduct negotiations. The Japanese spokesman's so-called "new developments in the near future," it is not known how it will proceed or on what legal principles.</p>
<p>Treaty Obligations Should be Observed</p>
<p>Even if we step back and say that a certain party is conducting negotiations with various governments or with representatives of other countries, Britain and the United States are among the countries that signed the Nine-Power Treaty. They should steadfastly uphold the integrity of China's land sovereignty. Moreover, since China's war of resistance, they have consistently stated that their Far East policy remains unchanged. Before the Nine-Power Treaty expires, they cannot fail to abide by treaty obligations and undermine their credibility by changing the Chinese courts established according to the agreement without the consent of the Chinese government. Moreover, the British and American ambassadors have not heard of this matter. Therefore, the ambitions of the Japanese puppets to covet the Chinese courts in the concession will ultimately come to naught.</p>

<p>Following the strike at the British-owned Gas Company, yesterday several hot water bottle factories were affected by insufficient gas supply, impacting their business. Manufacturing hot water bottle liners requires gas. Since the strike began, although the company has hired a large number of White Russian strikebreakers, their lack of skill has reduced the gas supply. As a result, several factories have also reduced their work efficiency, suffering significant losses. Yesterday afternoon, several hot water bottle factories held a meeting to discuss measures to negotiate with the company. The Shanghai Municipal Council's Chinese directors, Yu Qiaqing and Xi Yushu, recognizing that gas is a public utility and to prevent labor disputes from escalating, are rumored to meet with Chairman Cadell at the company's office on Jiangxi Road this morning.</p>

<p>Without Submitting to Provincial Government for Approval In the past, the export of domestic tea from various provinces required approval from the provincial government. Now, the Zhejiang Provincial Government, based on the general outline of the Ministry of Finance's regulations for managing domestic tea, stipulates that after domestic tea is inspected, the China Tea Company will issue a transportation certificate. The provincial governments and customs offices along the way will verify the certificate for release. Therefore, domestic tea will no longer be approved by the provincial government in the future but will be directly issued certificates by the China Tea Company for export. The purchase, transportation, and sale of export tea will still be carried out according to the regulations of the Ministry without any changes.</p>

<h3 id="e59">Cai Guohua's Home Suddenly Raided by Thugs Xi Yuliang Shot Cai Himself Injured in a Fall Both Sent to Hospital for Treatment, Lives Not in Danger <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>On Route Tenant in the French Concession, at about 10:00 PM on the night before last (27th), thugs broke into a residence at night and opened fire, shooting Xi Yuliang in the left ear. The bullet grazed his face. His younger brother, Delin, happened to be sitting with him and was unharmed. His brother-in-law, Cai Guohua, was wiping himself upstairs when he suddenly heard gunfire downstairs and cries for help. He rushed out from his room, intending to climb down the wall, but accidentally slipped and fell onto the glass skylight of No. 1 Fuxianfang Lane, causing severe lacerations to his legs and buttocks by the glass. The assailants then fled out the door. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Severed Ties, Suicide Note Left</p>
<p>No. 403 Route Tenant is a detached Western-style small house along the road. The owner is Cai Guohua, also known as Dianrong, a native of Nantong, 37 years old. He graduated from Jinling University in Nanjing and later studied land administration at the University of Michigan in the United States, earning a master's degree. Before the war, he served as a section chief in the Civil Affairs Department of Zhejiang Province for three years. After resigning, he brought his family to Shanghai, temporarily living as a recluse. Due to circumstances, he rarely went out and spent his time translating books as a pastime. This summer, he was hired as a Chinese professor at the National Shanghai Medical College. The appointment letter was just issued a few days ago.</p>
<p>Wife's Younger Brother Residing, Chatting About Family Matters</p>
<p>His wife, Xi Zhen, is in her thirties (from Changshu). Her younger brother, Xi Delin, 19 years old, is a senior high school student at Beicai Vocational School at No. 71, Lane 519, Hedu Road. He lives with his sister. Her older brother, Xi Yuliang (35 years old), teaches at Jinyun Elementary School in Jinyun County, eastern Zhejiang. He came to Shanghai for a short stay during the summer vacation to catch up with his siblings. He originally planned to return home within days, but the coastal areas of Zhejiang and Fujian were blockaded by the Japanese, so the trip did not materialize. At around 10:00 PM the night before last, the Xi brothers were chatting side by side on the sofa in the living room, forgetting to close the outer waist door.</p>
<p>Thugs Open Fire, Wounding Xi Yuliang</p>
<p>At this moment, three thugs suddenly appeared. Two of them stood at the door by the roadside as lookouts. One of them, dressed in a blue cloth shirt and pants, with a gray silk long gown draped over his shoulders, pushed open the door and rushed into the living room. Without asking any questions, he drew a pistol and fired one shot, hitting Xi Yuliang in the left cheek and piercing his right ear. He fell onto the sofa with a thud, covered in blood. Seeing that their purpose was achieved, the thugs turned and fled, disappearing without a trace. His brother, Delin, escaped unharmed and cried out for help.</p>
<p>Cai Jumps Out, Legs Lacerated</p>
<p>At this time, Cai Guohua was wiping himself in the attic upstairs. Hearing the sound of gunfire, footsteps, and cries for help, fearing that the thugs might try to go upstairs and cause further harm, he quickly jumped out of the window, intending to climb over the wall. Unexpectedly, he slipped and fell onto the large glass skylight of No. 1 Fuxianfang Lane, causing severe lacerations to his buttocks and legs by the glass. He fled in pain to the kitchen of his neighbor at No. 45 to temporarily hide and avoid danger.</p>
<p>Both Injured, but Lives Not in Danger</p>
<p>After the incident, Xi Delin reported it to the French Concession Police Headquarters. A large number of detectives rushed to investigate everything. However, the three thugs had already fled far away. An ambulance was summoned to send both injured men to Room 108 of Guangci Hospital for treatment. According to the doctor, although Xi and Cai were seriously injured, their lives were not in danger. The motive behind this assassination attempt is shrouded in mystery, and it is not known what the target was. The police are investigating.</p>

<p>According to news from the Xujiahui Observatory yesterday afternoon, the new hurricane in the Pacific has changed direction. Shanghai and the coastal areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang can now avoid the impact. The hurricane's direction has changed from "west-northwest" to "north." Yesterday, it reached 20 degrees north latitude and 116 degrees east longitude, with a force of 9 and a circumference of 60 nautical miles. The above position is between Hong Kong and the Dongsha Islands.</p>

<p>According to a telegram received by the shipping industry, Japanese warships outside Zhenhai continued to harass the fortress with artillery fire the day before yesterday, with shells landing in the mud and causing no damage. The number of Japanese warships outside Zhenhai has now decreased, and order in Ningbo and Zhenhai has returned to normal. The war situation has now eased. Although Japanese warships occasionally bombard fortresses and other places, the fighting has stopped. During the tense situation in the eastern Zhejiang war, almost all of the Japanese warships stationed in Shanghai left. Over the past two days, Japanese warships have been returning to the Huangpu River from Hangzhou Bay in succession. According to investigations, those arriving in Shanghai from there include Asakaze, the first-class destroyer Muhao, Renzidihao, Lianhao, and second-class destroyers, one of each; armed transport ships Hakone Maru, Hiramaru Maru, Tokumaru Maru, Nihonkai Maru, No. 7 Take Maru, No. 10 Unkai Maru, and the Red Cross ship Mikasayama Maru, totaling eleven ships.</p>
<h3 id="e62">Japanese Again Visit Route Massenet Postal Branch Copying Names and Addresses of Post Office Box Holders Negotiations Still Needed After Jappé Returns to Shanghai <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese side is now trying to extend the inspection work at the Shanghai Postal Administration to the French Concession. According to a visit by a Heiminsha News Agency reporter, the Route Massenet Postal Branch will be forced to implement mail inspection from the first of next month. On the day before yesterday (27th), four Japanese visited twice in the morning and afternoon, copying the names and addresses of post office box renters at the branch. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Rumored to Implement Inspection from Next Month</p>
<p>From 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and from 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM the day before yesterday, four plainclothes Japanese visited the Route Massenet Postal Branch twice, going directly into the office. These people did not have anyone from the Postal Administration accompany them. They demanded that the room planned to be set up for "mail inspectors" be completed as soon as possible. It is rumored that mail inspection will be implemented from the first of next month, with the Japanese side setting up seven "mail inspectors" at the branch, their hours being from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM. However, officials at the Postal Administration say that the inspection matter is still under negotiation, and whether it can be avoided depends on the negotiations with Postal Director Jappé, who is scheduled to return to Shanghai today.</p>
<p>All Offices Seen One by One</p>
<p>The four Japanese also entered the offices of the branch, inspecting the upstairs letter room, express mail room, registered mail room, and outgoing mail room. The four Japanese did not understand Chinese, so the branch could not answer the four Japanese's questions. However, they could read Chinese, so they used written notes to answer.</p>
<p>Names of Post Office Box Holders Copied</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Japanese at the Route Massenet branch again copied the names and addresses of the post office box renters at the branch. There are a total of 250 post office boxes rented by Chinese and foreign residents at the branch. In addition to those rented by foreigners or concession institutions, many are rented by Chinese from all walks of life.</p>
<p>Sketching Branch's Postal Route Map</p>
<p>The branch's scope is wider than other branches. The Japanese also sketched a copy of the delivery route map within the branch's area. The branch's postal route map extends east to the Eight Immortals Bridge, west to Haig Road, north to the border of the Public Concession, and south to Xujiahui Road. The delivery routes of all postal branches in the French Concession, except for the Rue du Consulat branch, are included in this map, such as those of the three branches on Rue Cardinal Mercier, Route Conty, and Xujiahui.</p>
<p>Telegraphs Accepted on Behalf Will Also Be Inspected</p>
<p>It is also learned that telegrams accepted and sent on behalf of customers by the branch will also be inspected at the same time as mail inspection is implemented. According to those familiar with postal branches, the telegrams accepted by Shanghai postal branches are now sent by the telegraphic communications organs under Japanese inspection. Only the American Commercial News Agency on the Bund sends telegrams to Chinese domestic areas, which is said to be extremely fast and reliable.</p>

<h3 id="e64">Shanghai Rice and Coal Gradually Becoming Sufficient, Life Slightly More Stable. Foreign Rice Imports Cannot be Hidden by Importers. Fair Pricing Brings Rice Gradually Back on Track. Coal Industry Orders 100,000 Tons of Foreign Coal to Arrive in Shanghai by Early Winter <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>According to foreign newspapers, several rice importers in the city have been trying to keep the arrival of new rice shipments secret, but have failed. As a result, despite their efforts to raise rice prices, prices continue to fall. The Shun King Company's Mosna vessel arrived yesterday (the 27th) from Bangkok with 18,000 bags of Siamese rice, further increasing Shanghai's rice supply. According to Mr. He, the Deputy Director of the Public Works Department, current rice prices are relatively low, and residents should take the opportunity to purchase. In addition, rice is being shipped from Hong Kong, Saigon, and Siam, with an estimated 250,000 more bags of foreign rice expected to arrive in Shanghai within three weeks.</p>
<p>Supplementation</p>
<p>It is reported that the 100,000 bags of foreign rice ordered by local merchants at the suggestion of the authorities of the two concessions, part of which has already arrived at the port, and the remainder will arrive in Shanghai by August 15th. It is said that the purchasers of this batch of foreign rice are not those who wantonly raise prices. Mr. He also stated that as Shanghai rice prices have already fallen, the 10,000 bags of foreign rice ordered will be stored for future needs in case of a rice shortage. The fair-price rice sales that began on July 16th will only continue for eight days, with the price of broken rice set at 40 yuan per picul (80 kilograms). When the fair-price sales began, rice prices were much higher than today, so many people benefited from the fair prices. It is found that each of the 18 fair-price rice shops in the Public Concession was able to sell 50 bags initially, but last week, as rice prices fell sharply, the market price of foreign dregs rice was only one or two yuan different from the fair price, so the number of buyers of fair rice has decreased. However, all 15,000 bags of fair-price broken rice are expected to be sold out by the end, and it is estimated that about 750,000 people will have purchased fair-price rice by then.</p>
<p>Falling Rice Prices</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Rice Evaluation Committee was officially established, it immediately began to assess the highest prices for buying and selling foreign rice, namely 63.5 yuan for Saigon Siam No. 1, 63 yuan for Fire Pattern, 61.5 yuan for Saigon Siam No. 2, 61 yuan for Small Twisted, 59.5 yuan for High Tokyo Blood Rice, 56 yuan for Tokyo Brown Rice, 53.5 yuan for Rice Green, and 49 yuan for Mixed Broken (the above prices are the prices assessed at the first meeting on the 9th of this month). However, as foreign rice has poured into the port, No. 2 Saigon Siam has fallen to 46 yuan, a decrease of 15.5 yuan compared to the first evaluation. The price of domestic Du Geng goods has also fallen by 13 or 14 yuan successively. The numbers for the fall in price of various grades of foreign rice are recorded as follows: (1) No. 1 Saigon Siam, down 11 yuan; (2) No. 2 Saigon Siam, down 15.5 yuan; (3) Fire Twisted, down 11 yuan; (4) Small Twisted, down 12.5 yuan; (5) High Tokyo Blood Rice, down 14.5 yuan; (6) Tokyo Brown Rice, down 14.5 yuan; (7) Rice Green, down 12.5 yuan. It is also learned that the Saigon-loaded Helspont vessel with 25,000 bags of tribute rice is expected to arrive at the port at 4:00 PM today, berthing at the Beijing Road Bund Wharf.</p>
<p>Telegraphing Orders for Foreign Coal</p>
<p>Although the stockpiles of coal depots in Pudong and Puxi are increasing daily, coal businesses, in order to prepare for the future and further increase their coal reserves, have jointly telegraphed coal-producing regions such as India and Annam, taking advantage of the stable exchange rate and low production prices, to order a total of 100,000 tons of smoky white coal lumps and dross, worth approximately one million national currency. This batch of coal has not yet been loaded onto ships and is expected to be loaded for shipment to Shanghai in mid-October. It is found that a total of 182,024 tons of coal were shipped from foreign countries in June of this year, valued at 1,900,821 gold, equivalent to 5,145,522 yuan in national currency, with British India accounting for the largest share, totaling 76,256 tons, followed by Annam with 47,286 tons, and Taiwan in third place with 21,948 tons. Imports in May totaled 182,832 tons, valued at 4,869,584 yuan in national currency.</p>

<h3 id="e66">A Certain University Professor in this City Abandons His Post to Join the Army <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>A professor at a certain university in this city, namely Mr. Wang Weixi, a famous basketball player in Shanghai in the past, seeing that his hometown elders were in deep water and scorching fire after the Japanese army occupied his hometown, was eager for righteous indignation, so he abandoned his post to join the army, gathered young comrades, returned to his hometown to organize a guerrilla team, fought many times, and achieved great results. He also made bandits disappear and the local area peaceful. The people all praised this fortune.</p>
<p>Committing Evil</p>
<p>Heyu Bridge, thirty miles north of the city, is the only major town under the county. After its fall, all the local responsible persons have fled elsewhere. Cheng Youda operated a cattle business in the town. He usually committed evil deeds, and people generally regarded him as a "different person." When the national army moved west and the Japanese army occupied the town, Cheng came out to receive the Japanese army, winning the favor of the Japanese side. He was immediately appointed as the chairman of the so-called "Maintenance Association" of the town, and thus seized all the public funds of the town in the name of maintenance fees, becoming a wealthy man of the time.</p>
<p>Righteousness Over Family</p>
<p>His son, Weixin, was a handsome young man, always with vigor, but under the current environment, he greatly disliked his father's actions. He secretly gathered a small number of young people, hid on the shore of the nearby lake, gathered comrades, organized the masses, and opposed his father, showing a great sense of righteousness over family. Those who heard the news and came to serve reached several hundred. Weixin knew that his mission was getting bigger and his responsibility was getting heavier. Without talent, knowledge, and the ability to endure hardship, it would be difficult to plan everything perfectly. He then remembered Wang Weixi, who was teaching at a certain university in Shanghai, and rushed to Shanghai overnight to urge him to return to his hometown.</p>
<p>Abandoning the Pen for the Sword</p>
<p>Wang Weixi is from Heyu Bridge in Yixing. He had a close relationship with Cheng. When he was studying at a certain university in southern Shanghai, he was extremely fond of sports and was a famous basketball player in Shanghai. He had repeatedly served as a representative of the Chinese basketball team and attended international competitions. After graduating, he immediately took a teaching position at his original school. He was always loyal and patriotic, with great ambitions. He believed that in this great era, he should personally go to the front line and risk his life on the battlefield. He had long harbored this intention and finally achieved his goal. Last year, he met his friend Cheng Weixin. After a thorough discussion, he made several points, the main one being to ask Cheng's father, Cheng Youda, to immediately leave Heyu Bridge. Cheng immediately accepted completely and promised to handle everything with full authority. Thereupon, he resolutely resigned from all his posts, abandoned his pen for the sword, and set off to return to Yixing.</p>
<p>Outstanding War Records</p>
<p>After the response, in addition to reorganizing the original team, he recruited comrades such as Tan Dong and actively organized the masses. In the past few months, he attacked the Japanese army six times, with the battles of An Yu Bridge, Five Caves Bridge, and Zhang Jin Dam being the most successful. In addition to annihilating dozens of Japanese soldiers, he also captured seven people and obtained many guns and military uniforms. As for the elimination of traitors, bandits, and the eradication of bad elements, there were daily reports. Now, within a five-mile radius of the area, bandits have disappeared, the neighborhoods are peaceful, and merchants and people are enjoying their livelihoods. He Bodian, the owner of Yongtaixiang Cotton Cloth Shop, No. 63 Qingyuan Lane, Beijing Road, Guangdong, ordered 480 pieces of Qinghua Factory's frog-colored label cloth from Chen Yongsen, the owner of Zhikang Cotton Cloth Shop, No. 20 Bai'er Road, Nanyang Bridge, on April 10th of this year, at a price of 38.5 yuan per piece, packed in eight boxes. It was stipulated that Chen Yongsen would be responsible for obtaining a domestic goods certificate from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, one for each box, and send it with the goods so that they could be shipped and sold to the interior in batches. He Bodian immediately paid Chen the full price of 18,480 yuan. Unexpectedly, Chen gave He only one domestic goods certificate, and it was forged. The remaining seven certificates were delayed for two months and the contract was not fulfilled. At that time, the cloth had risen to 58 yuan per piece. Because He did not have the domestic goods certificate, he could not ship and sell the goods, and the cloth that had already been sold was also returned by the customers. He then asked lawyer He Niande to write to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to inquire, and Chen had not applied to the Chamber for a certificate. At this point, He realized that Chen was using inferior goods</p>
<p>to pose as domestic goods, and forging a certificate to carry out fraudulent means to make money. Therefore, He recently hired lawyers He Niande and Mao Xianshen to file a complaint with the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court, accusing Chen of three crimes, namely fraud, breach of trust, and forgery of documents. The case was recently heard by Judge Li in the Second Criminal Court. The plaintiff, He Bodian, also claimed damages and other expenses, totaling 27,840 yuan. The defendant, accompanied by defense lawyers Zhu Taiqing and Yu Hualong, pleaded to the court, stating that the defendant was also a victim. Originally, the domestic goods certificate was entrusted by the defendant to Wang Xianglin, who specializes in handling</p>
<p>certificate documents</p>
<p>, to handle. As soon as the defendant received the notice from the plaintiff that it was forged, he immediately reported it to the Central Patrol Room for investigation. Wang had already taken refuge in the Hongkou area, and there was a check stub that showed the defendant's payment of the handling fee to Wang Xianglin as evidence. This matter clearly proves that it has nothing to do with the defendant and the court should make a clear judgment. Judge Li verified the words and ordered a change of date to summon Wang Xianglin to the court for investigation and questioning.</p>

<p>Mao Hui, a native of Jiangshan County, Zhejiang Province, is 64 years old. He has been practicing medicine for a living, running a clinic at No. 11 West Street, Jianye Lane, French Concession, for more than ten years. Recently, Mao and three or four friends jointly established Daxin Trading Company, specializing in stationery, which they transport to the interior. Mao serves as an important officer in the company. In recent years, he has</p>
<p>suffered from illness</p>
<p>and finds it difficult to move around, and has very little contact with the outside world. However, the Japanese suddenly pointed out that Mao Hui was related to the Chinese guerrillas in the suburbs of Shanghai, so they sent a large number of personnel to request assistance from the French Patrol Room to search Mao's residence. The French Patrol Room immediately dispatched detectives to</p>
<p>join the Japanese personnel</p>
<p>, traveling in two private cars and a large truck, with a total of about thirty to sixty people. They arrived at Mao's residence at about 6:00 AM yesterday morning. At that time, Mao Hui and his family were all fast asleep when a large number of detectives suddenly poured in, which was very surprising. Japanese personnel and French Patrol Room detectives then</p>
<p>began to search</p>
<p>Mao's residence, relatives' and friends' deposited clothing trunks, drawers, and other places were carefully searched for about an hour. As a result, nothing was found, nor were any documents related to the guerrillas discovered. However, the Japanese insisted on</p>
<p>taking Mao Hui</p>
<p>himself to the French Patrol Room. After the French Patrol Room questioned him briefly, detectives escorted him back to Jianye Lane to retrieve a book of accounts from Daxin Trading Company and a book of Mao's daily notes. He was still taken back to the detention center by the detectives. As of 1:00 AM this morning, he had not been released.</p>

<p>Based on reports from informants, Chinese detectives from the Lao Zha Patrol Room said that drug dealers nicknamed the "Black, White, and Red Three Kings," Xiancai Amao, Wang Hongfa, Xu Fuyuan, etc., had secretly set up drug organizations at No. 65 and No. 67 Beihai Road. They immediately led Chinese and Western police officers to the addresses and arrested five accomplices, Wang Shengcai, Wang Huangshi, etc., seizing about eight ounces of heroin and dozens of ounces of opium. Yesterday, they were sent to the First Criminal Court of the First Special Court for prosecution according to law. After questioning by Judge Feng, the defendants were remanded in custody to await the arrest of the main culprits for further investigation.</p>
<p>Zhu Hongjin, a handyman from Shenhe Truck Shop at No. 165 Alabastor Road, Yixing, was washing his feet at the water tap in front of the truck shop at 6:00 PM on the 7th of this month.

Because the flowers in the basket were withering, he also took water from the tap to water the flowers and accidentally sprinkled Zhu's shoes. Zhu immediately questioned Mao, and the two had an argument. Zhu actually incited his fellow handyman, Shao Arong, a local, to beat Mao to death together. Afterwards, the patrol arrived and detained Zhu and Shao and sent them to the First Special Court, charging them with injuring someone leading to death. Judge Jiang concluded the trial a few days ago and scheduled the verdict for August 4th.</p>

<p>Ai Mei, a song queen from Beiying Shuyu, No. 1, Lane 1, Xinhui Le Lane, Yunnan Road, recently filed a complaint with the Criminal Court of the First Special Court, accusing Chen Yufa (residing at Hongyun Villa No. 28, Jing'an Temple Road, and the factory director of Yuhua Tobacco Company) of bigamy, abandonment, and encroachment. The complaint stated that she was an uneducated woman with a shallow mind. In August of the lunar calendar last year, she met the defendant in</p>
<p>Beiying Shuyu</p>
<p>. Seeing that she was slightly attractive, the defendant claimed that he was not yet married and asked to marry her. She was lured by his sweet words and believed it to be true, so on November 2nd, she and the defendant signed a marriage certificate at Lao Ban Zhai Restaurant on Hankou Road with the witness Hou Lanpo and others. Afterwards, the defendant ordered her to</p>
<p>leave her family</p>
<p>and move all her belongings to the upstairs of Gu Yuanfa Furniture Store, Laohui Le Lane, Sanma Road to live together, and then moved to No. 479 Weihaiwei Road. At that time, the defendant suddenly said to her, "My wife has now passed away, so you can rest assured." Only then did she know that the defendant was married. However, since what's done is done, she could only blame herself for her bad luck. Not long after living together, the defendant said that the cigarette factory</p>
<p>business was booming and that it could make five or six times the profit. Therefore, he invested the 500 yuan she had deposited in Wing On Company, a gold bracelet, a watch, two small diamond rings, and a leather coat in the cigarette factory. On April 30th of this year, the defendant asked her to open a room at the New Shanghai Hotel and forced her to hand over the marriage certificate. Hearing this, she felt so sad that she tried to commit suicide by swallowing</p>
<p>opium. The defendant discovered this and asked a doctor to save her. The defendant's actions violated the criminal law, and she asked the court to punish him accordingly. The court accepted the complaint, and Judge Xiao held a trial in the First Criminal Court yesterday morning. The defendant hired lawyer Yin Tinghua to defend him. He claimed that in October of last year, he socialized with clients and frequented the flower world, getting to know the plaintiff. He acknowledged that they had lived together for a while, but the plaintiff had long been living a life of a goddess,</p>
<p>unaccustomed to domestic life</p>
<p>. Therefore, on February 24th of this year, while the defendant was out, she suddenly took away the radio, clothes, jewelry, and a gold ring with the words "Yu Fa" on it, and hid without a trace. He had entrusted lawyer Yin to publish a statement in the newspaper, severing the cohabitation relationship with the plaintiff. Therefore, there was no crime to speak of. The court verified the words and instructed both parties to go out and try to reconcile, rescheduling the hearing for the 2nd of next month.</p>

<p>Sir, I have just read in the social column of your newspaper that Si Gedebo, a policeman from the Tesla Road, Hague Lee Police Station, had a conflict with Tao Awu, a Jiangbei rickshaw puller, and beat Tao Awu to death. It is clear that the report is inaccurate. It is found that the rickshaw puller Tao Awu had a conflict with a passenger whose name is unknown, resulting in the passenger falling on the car. Later, the on-duty policeman arrived and took the assailant, Tao Awu, and the injured passenger to the police station together. Moreover, it has nothing to do with me. It is a matter of human life and concerns my reputation. Therefore, I am writing to your newspaper to ask you to correct it as soon as possible in order to clarify the facts. Sincerely, Si Gedebo, No. 151 Hague Lee, Tesla Road, Zhang Yuxi. July 27th.</p>

<p>(Guilin Airlines News) Since the outbreak of the war in southern Guangxi, the number of young people in the war zone who have been affected by the war and have become wanderers and dropouts has been considerable. Moreover, students and soldiers from the war zone have returned to the province to enroll in schools one after another. The capacity of public and private secondary schools in this province to accommodate students from the war zone by borrowing or transferring schools has reached its maximum, and it is difficult to continue to accommodate them. The local authorities have telegraphed the Ministry of Education to establish national secondary schools in this province. The Ministry of Education replied that there were many difficulties in establishing national secondary schools and instructed to set up provincial temporary secondary schools. If the funds are insufficient, the provincial government will subsidize them. The provincial government plans to open a provincial temporary secondary school in Yangli and Rong County each starting in the fall of this year in order to accommodate students withdrawing from the war zones of Nanning, Wuwu, Longzhou, etc. It is planned to temporarily recruit six classes per school, with an estimated opening cost of about 40,000 yuan per school and a regular annual cost of 38,000 yuan. It is reported that the opening costs and the costs for the first semester of the 29th academic year have been requested from the Ministry of Education for full subsidy. From the second semester of the 29th academic year, the required regular expenses will be subsidized by the Ministry of Education by 70%.</p>

<p>The Dumb-Mute Youth School is located on the fifth floor of the Foch Road, Pudong Building. The establishment of the Dumb-Mute Youth School has already been recorded, and it is currently being submitted to the Chongqing Ministry of Education for registration. It is heard that the school's board of directors has approved the provision of free aid to five impoverished students in celebration of the school's second anniversary this semester, in order to benefit deaf and mute children. Any deaf and mute children who aspire to study and acquire self-reliance skills in the future can apply directly. The school also offers specialized courses in art, typing, and handicrafts, specifically designed for deaf and mute students who have graduated from elementary school. Enrollment is limited. It is heard that the school is scheduled to open on August 24th.</p>
<p>Siyuan Middle School has been specially approved for registration by the Ministry of Education of this city. Siyuan Middle School, originally located west of Avenue Edward VII, Datong Road, has received an exceptionally enthusiastic response from applicants since it began enrolling students this year. To ensure effective teaching and management, the school is exclusively accepting male students, thereby imposing a restriction. Consequently, female applicants were initially rejected. Subsequently, in response to requests from parents of female students from all walks of life, a second branch was established at No. 1233, Gordon Road, Rue Robert, to accommodate female students. Since the start of enrollment, many of the female students who were previously rejected by the school have flocked to apply. It is now known that the school is scheduled to hold entrance examinations for new and transfer students at all levels of junior and senior high school on August 2nd. Candidates for both branches will take the examinations simultaneously at the first branch. According to the person in charge of the school, the school building of the first branch can originally only accommodate more than 500 people. Aside from those admitted last time, there are not many remaining places, and the number of applicants this time is almost double the remaining places. Therefore, it is planned to stop and no longer continue to recruit students after this enrollment.</p>
<p>Xia Guang Middle School, located at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Datong Road, has been operating for many years. For the main subjects in the British system, classes are held for more than seven hours per week. In the first round of enrollment, more than sixty new and transfer students at all levels of junior and senior high school were admitted, including Xin Fu and Shu Zhenguo. The school's second round of continued enrollment for new students is scheduled for August 3rd. It is also learned that the school has established a Zhu Scholarship examination system for the senior high school department and free student policies for all levels since last year. Application regulations are available upon request, and those from impoverished families are welcome to apply.</p>

<h3 id="e88">The Contents of Inheritance and Methods of Tax Evasion—Strategies and Countermeasures <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>— Ai Cheng</p>
<p>Foreword</p>
<p>Direct taxes are not only difficult to shift, but also have stable revenue. Moreover, their tax rates can be progressive, making them very fair. European and American countries have successively adopted them, and their share of fiscal revenue has gradually increased. However, China's fiscal revenue has always been mainly based on customs, unified, and consumption taxes. Since 1936, it has followed other countries by first levying income tax, and then, in view of the development of various industries, it has also levied excessive profit tax. This year, it has also levied inheritance tax. According to general opinion, a large inheritance obtained by an heir is similar to a windfall. It does not require the heir's own labor. However, the state often protects its safety and can therefore tax it to make up for fiscal deficits. At the same time, the burden of inheritance tax, in theory, does not fall on the heir, but on the deceased himself. However, the deceased does not feel the pain of bearing the tax in advance. The tax base is also very stable and not easily affected by the environment. Therefore, inheritance tax can be said to be the fairest of direct taxes.</p>
<p>Contents of Inheritance</p>
<p>According to the provisions of China's Inheritance Tax Regulations, the principle of territoriality is the rule, and the principle of nationality is the exception. That is, regardless of who has inheritance in China, it should be taxed. Similarly, Chinese citizens who have property abroad but have property in China should also be taxed. Now, let's first explain the contents of inheritance. Inheritance is the property left by the deceased. Its contents can be divided into broad and narrow definitions. Broadly defined inheritance includes not only positive assets but also negative assets. Negative assets are debts. Usual inheritance is the inheritance of broadly defined inheritance. Narrowly defined inheritance is the portion remaining after deducting negative assets from positive assets. The object of inheritance tax, in theory, should be limited to narrowly defined inheritance. The Inheritance Tax Regulations also make such provisions and the scope of deductions is quite broad. (1) Taxes and fines payable according to law (criminal fines (administrative fines)). (2) Debts not repaid by the deceased before death. (3) Necessary expenses for managing current inheritance and executing wills. (4) Agricultural implements or work tools for engaging in other industries, with a value not exceeding 500 yuan. (5) Timber that has not reached the felling age according to law. In addition, there are provisions that certain types of inheritance are exempt from inheritance tax due to their special circumstances. (1) The total value of the inheritance is less than 5,000 yuan. (2) Inheritance of officers, soldiers, and civil servants of the army and navy who die in action or are injured in war. (3) Books and articles related to culture, history, and art in the inheritance, which the heir declares to preserve and registers with the inheritance tax collection agency, but the heir must pay taxes if he transfers these books and articles. (4) Property donated to governments at all levels. (5) Property donated to educational, cultural, or charitable public welfare undertakings, not exceeding 500,000 yuan. (6) Copyrights of the deceased and patents on academic inventions, or artistic works created by himself.</p>
<p>Possibilities of Tax Evasion</p>
<p>However, there is a problem that is difficult to solve in the contents of the inheritance. That is, should the compensation obtained after the death of the deceased who has life insurance with an insurance company be included in the inheritance for calculation? Although China's Insurance Law has been promulgated, it has not yet been implemented. According to usual circumstances and general legal principles, this kind of compensation obtained after death cannot be regarded as the property of the deceased, because obtaining this property requires the death of the insured as the time limit. Therefore, this compensation must be obtained by the beneficiary after the death of the deceased. Logically, it cannot be regarded as inheritance. Therefore, even if the deceased goes bankrupt after death, the life insurance compensation will not be included in the bankrupt estate for calculation, and the family can enjoy all the benefits. If the same interpretation is made in the Inheritance Tax Regulations, then the compensation should not be taxed. However, this regulation does not have detailed and explicit provisions. If such an interpretation is made, it seems to be inconsistent with the principle of levying inheritance tax. Because if the compensation does not need to be taxed, the deceased can use his property for life insurance in advance, expand the amount of insurance, and enter into a death insurance contract with the insurer for life without survival conditions. After death, the heir can obtain all tax-free property. Now, in order to avoid this kind of malpractice and to accommodate the facts, it is better to include it in the inheritance for calculation. There are many ways to evade inheritance tax, which are briefly described below:</p>
<p>(1) Division during life. The division of inheritance by the deceased during his lifetime does not necessarily contain malicious intent. For example, the deceased often divides the inheritance during his lifetime to avoid the trouble of dividing the inheritance among his children after death. However, malicious division is inevitable. For example, before death, the inheritance is first divided and registered under the names of the children. The most common are farmland and houses in the countryside. Movable property is even easier to divide and does not require legal procedures. It can achieve the expected purpose simply by separate possession. This kind of division is more popular in China than in Europe and America because China and Europe and America have different customs. Europe and America still value individualism, and fathers and sons are independent of each other. Usually, they can only inherit their father's property after their father's death. In China, the family system is prevalent, and property is often distributed in advance due to separation, marriage, and business operations. Therefore, this regulation stipulates that if property is divided within three years before the death of the deceased, the property that has been divided should still be regarded as part of the inheritance and taxed together, which is not unreasonable.</p>
<p>(2) Gifts during life or forging debts. Gifts during life means making false or real gifts of all property to third parties as much as possible, so that the total value of the inheritance is reduced to the minimum. However, this kind of gift can usually be resisted based on the legal principle that the exercise of rights shall not harm the rights of others, unless it is explicitly stipulated by law as invalid. This regulation explicitly stipulates that property given as gifts within three years before death should still be regarded as inheritance. Forging debts means increasing negative assets, indirectly reducing inheritance relatively, and reducing the amount of tax payable. These two methods are often used by heirs in limited inheritance. Now, before inheritance tax is levied, there must be inheritance facts. If the inheritor engages in this kind of behavior in the inheritance facts, he can also benefit from inheritance taxation, killing two birds with one stone.</p>
<p>(3) Concealing property or making false records on the inheritance book. Concealing property means hiding the property that has been obtained so that others do not know about it. The concealed property is usually movable property, mostly of high value and small volume. For example, diamond rings or cash are most easily concealed by the deceased. Making false records on the inheritance book means lowering the value of the property as much as possible, so that the valuation committee will inevitably be subjected to its prior hints in the future and be deceived. This is also a common occurrence in limited inheritance.</p>
<p>(4) Transferring property abroad. This can be said to be a kind of evasion behavior. For example, if overseas Chinese engage in trade with a certain country, they often establish current accounts with local banks or store deposits as collateral. However, they do not have an address in the country. When death is imminent, in order to avoid taxation, they withdraw the deposit and remit it abroad, making it difficult for the government to deal with. If they have an address in China, then it should be treated differently.</p>
<p>(5) Although not dividing the property during life, registering the property under different names. This method is often used for bank deposits. For example, the account name for a deposit in a certain bank is set as Fuli, and the account name for a deposit in another bank is set as Luli. Although there are many account names, there is only one person. Therefore, the total amount of inheritance after death is difficult to investigate and determine. The characteristics of progressive taxation are also difficult to express. For example, although the income tax rate that has already been levied is also a progressive system, it is still levied separately because the total amount of income is not easy to determine. The inequality is obvious.</p>
<p>Proposed Measures to Prevent Tax Evasion</p>
<p>The methods to prevent tax evasion can be divided into active and passive. The active aspect is to vigorously instill knowledge to the people and encourage patriotic enthusiasm. To make ordinary people know the true meaning of inheritance tax, which is by no means a government extortion. And explain how the government will benefit after the inheritance tax is levied. All of these can make people happy to do it and pay automatically. Therefore, it can not only increase the amount of tax, but also reduce the expenses incurred in taxation. As for passive prevention, such as establishing penalties. Those who maliciously try to reduce the amount of tax and hide property should be punished. However, the severity of the penalty does not have to be too severe, only strict investigation is required. Make sure that lawbreakers cannot escape the law. And encourage the reporting of concealed inheritance. Secondly, if there are detailed records of each person's property, the local competent authorities should conduct frequent investigations so that the property situation in the local area is well understood, and it will be difficult to conceal it. At the same time, there must be careful investigation of the household registration, so it is not easy to create account names arbitrarily. However, passive prevention is ultimately not as thorough and economical as active prevention. Because passive prevention is very costly, and there are many tricks to tax evasion. For example, in Shanghai, foreign financial power is quite large, so people who want to hide property can deposit it in foreign banks in advance. As for the reason why the income tax rate levied on bank interest is only 5% of the total interest, the reason is also here. Because after adopting the progressive tax rate, the wealthy will never want to deposit all their property in Chinese banks. Therefore, not only will tax revenue be insecure, but China's financial strength will also be damaged.</p>
<p>Now, inheritance tax is still in the trial stage in our country, and we cannot immediately expect it to achieve satisfactory results. However, the biggest shortcoming is that the levying of inheritance tax pays too much attention to the object of taxation. The same is true for income tax. For example, if the deceased A has a family property of 4 million yuan, after deducting 20% tax, 3.6 million yuan remains. He leaves behind a wife and three young children, and the burden in the future will be heavy. However, B also has 4 million yuan of family property. After deducting the tax, he also only has 3.6 million yuan left. He only leaves behind a wife and one child, and the burden is very light. Compared with the two, although the tax rates are the same, it seems that the tax levied on the former is heavier than the latter in fact. Unless the tax rate of the former is reduced, or the tax rate of the latter is increased, it can be considered fair. Therefore, in addition to using the size of the amount of the taxable object as the standard for increasing the tax rate, the environment of the heir must also be considered to make it fair in fact. However, we deeply believe that the levying of inheritance will definitely bring some benefit to the country's finances.</p>
<h3 id="e89">On "Golden Toilet" Theory and "Golden Table" Theory <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Shizhi</p>
<p>During the final years of the last European War, when Lenin led the Soviet people in implementing the socialist revolution, he declared: "Gather all the world's gold and use it in place of bricks and tiles to build the walls of several public toilets." Although this proposition was not implemented, gold was indeed no longer valued by the general public in the Soviet Union. While the Soviet government worked hard to increase gold production, it did so solely to meet the needs of general capitalist countries. What they welcomed were goods, useful goods.</p>
<p>Now, the European War has just entered its second phase, but Germany is already discussing the postwar world economy and the world. Dr. Wenxichu, the chief writer of the Berlin General News, recently published a paper (see this newspaper on the 23rd of this month). He believes that the use of gold after the war is extremely narrow: "No one wants to carry such heavy things anymore; people all over the world prefer to use bank notes and checks; they no longer want to use gold for payment." America, which is full of gold, may only be able to "melt the gold and make it into gold utensils for the tables of American ministers and ambassadors."</p>
<p>Similarly, German Minister of Economic Affairs Funk also said: The postwar international economic organization will "develop towards a clearing system," and "Europe's future currency can no longer be based on gold." Therefore, he said: "We dare not predict what the future of American gold will be."</p>
<p>Originally, gold cannot be directly used to satisfy hunger, nor can it be directly used to cover the body: it can be said that it makes no contribution to human material life. It is only because it is used as a medium of exchange that it has created its current "almighty state." Moreover, because its production areas are unevenly distributed, and because its accumulation forms are unevenly distributed, there is a "gold plethora" in some places and "gold anemia" in others, causing all kinds of unrest in the general social economy and even the entire world economy. Therefore, in the monetary trends after the First European War, there was already the theory of a fixed value of coins. Since the outbreak of the world panic in 1929, the successive abandonment of the gold standard by various countries has actually been the initial practice of this monetary theory. However, the Soviet Union and Germany's contempt for gold is more likely to be based on political action rather than monetary theory.</p>
<p>People to people, country to country, never forget their unique weapons. They use their special weapons to enhance their own status and increase their power to control the other party. As a result, inequality between rich and poor is formed in society, and inequality between strong and weak is formed in the international community. Lenin was leading the proletarian revolution, of course, he first had to disarm the bourgeoisie. The bourgeoisie relies on their unique gold to create their own special rights, so he came up with a "golden toilet theory."</p>
<p>After Germany conquered France, although the future of the Anglo-German war is still unpredictable, its position in Europe has undoubtedly become astonishing.</p>
<p>Germany's greatest economic weakness is its lack of gold. If Europe's economy is to be transformed according to its ideals, the first thing to do is to overturn the position of gold in the modern economic system. Disarming other countries means strengthening one's own power. This goes without saying!</p>
<p>What is even more noteworthy is that the German side issued this theory at a time when the United States was deeply troubled by the excessive expansion of gold; especially on the day when Roosevelt accepted his third nomination as a presidential candidate. President Roosevelt has a strong sense of justice, and Americans are also inherently inclined to ally with Britain. The German side, of course, is always clear about this. The concentrated gold and silver policy is a part of President Roosevelt's New Deal movement. He attempts to establish a foundation for controlling international finance by this means, and then, according to his ideals, redistribute the world's gold and silver and establish a new international finance. This point is understood by Germany, which is short of gold. Therefore, when President Roosevelt accepted his third nomination as a Democratic presidential candidate, the German side successively published the "golden table" theory, and there is a connection between them; it can also be imagined. To put it more clearly: this "golden table" theory can increase the American people's distress over gold plethora, can help a part of the American opposition to the New Deal movement gain momentum; in the American presidential election, it may therefore have some effects that conform to German interests; perhaps this is another reason why the Germans are particularly happy to discuss this today? If Germany also had a large amount of gold, then it might not be willing to do so anymore! It is precisely because Germany is a gold-poor country, and at the same time, it has indeed established its position in Europe; in addition, the world's gold is indeed accumulated too much in the United States, and the United States, both the government and the public, really feel the pain of not being able to disperse this excessively expanded gold. In addition to this drastic change in the international political situation and the drastic change in the distribution of world gold, as well as the monetary trend that has long surpassed the constraints of gold, the change in the status of gold after the war is probably an inevitable trend?</p>

<h3 id="e91">A Review of the Foreign Exchange Market This Week <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>According to the report of the Shanghai Economic Consulting Institute, the foreign exchange market last week not only did not break away from the hovering, but also the ups and downs became more and more stable. The volume of transactions was small, and most of them were swaps. The highest US dollar exchange rate was 6.125 yuan, and the lowest was 6.0625 yuan. The highest British pound exchange rate was 3 shillings, 8 pence, 90625, and the lowest was 3 shillings, 8 pence, 4375. The stability is due to half of the international situation and the brewing of domestic military affairs, and half of the looming peace atmosphere. In addition, the recent sharp decline in foreign trade, the time of the slack season, the situation is inherently appropriate. International routes have repeatedly encountered obstacles, and the impact is not shallow. Since trade has been frustrated, the supply and demand of foreign exchange has naturally decreased. Although it is said that the fluctuations in the foreign exchange market are due to speculators making trouble, the trend of the foreign exchange market depends on the promotion of commerce. Those who wait for the opportunity to move are just fueling the flames, and they are not enough to influence the original trend. Moreover, in the turmoil of May, operators have generally suffered great pain, and their vitality has not recovered. Even if they have surplus funds, they will be hesitant to move forward.</p>
<p>Since the deterioration of the European situation, I don't know how many people from Southeast Asia have returned to Shanghai with funds. In addition, the British government has tightened currency management, and currencies directly or indirectly linked to the pound cannot help but feel uneasy. In addition, the exchange rate between the US and Britain is also restricted, so more and more people come to Shanghai to sell foreign exchange and exchange it for legal tender. Recently, the deposits of various banks in this city have increased sharply, and it is said that most of them come from other places, which is clear evidence.</p>
<p>Even for those who hold foreign exchange drafts in this city, because the use of foreign exchange drafts is becoming narrower and narrower, and dangers abound, they also think of home when they are away from home, and sell them in time, still relying on legal tender. Pessimists believe that the market is full of speculative funds, and the group buying of foreign exchange one day is actually a hidden worry in the foreign exchange market. However, they do not know that the reason why the speculative funds are full is precisely because there is doubt about foreign currency. To return to the original state, there is still the phenomenon of squeezing, that is, the squeezing trend of gold and foreign exchange is becoming more and more severe. Recalling May of this year, when the foreign exchange rate tightened, the gold price was squeezed to a huge amount of 700 yuan to 1,000 yuan. Now it is only squeezed by 300 to 400 yuan. According to the smaller the degree of gold squeezing, it can be proved that the US dollar needs are lacking. Because speculators buy gold, they must have strength. Although mortgages can be made, they are limited by laws and regulations, and the number is limited. Foreign exchange drafts only need to pay a deposit, and there are one or two months of futures that can be made. Therefore, although gold and foreign exchange have the same trend, in terms of supply and demand, the need for foreign exchange drafts is more extensive, and the actual use should be prioritized by foreign exchange drafts. The close convergence of the trends of the two shows that all parties are not very interested in foreign exchange. Looking at the reduction of discounted exchange rates and the convergence of current and futures exchange rates, the trend of the market can be seen.</p>

<p>— Sheng Kaiqiong</p>
<p>Continued from yesterday—July 27—</p>
<p>However, after the implementation of this law, the source of free pounds cannot be completely cut off. Its sources include (1) dividends and interest due to foreign funds inside and outside the sterling area; (2) insurance compensation obtained by foreigners in British insurance companies; (3) the transfer of foreign pound deposits to central people or another foreign pound deposit; (4) pound payments for goods imported into the UK under pre-war contracts. Free pounds generated from these four aspects are still traded according to the market price in New York, so if the British government wants to completely ban free pounds, it must have the help of the United States.</p>
<p>On July 18, the UK implemented new regulations for managing the pound. The details of these regulations are still unknown. According to Reuters' London telegram on the 19th, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, like the Bank of England, sells pounds at 4.025 and buys pounds at 4.035, and establishes a "Registered Accounts". In addition to the United States, the British government also has special agreements with Switzerland (Switzerland is also a place where free pounds are active), Canada, Newfoundland, the Dutch East Indies, Belgium, Congo, Syria, Sweden, Argentina, Brazil, and Romania. But regardless of its details, just looking at the point that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York buys and sells pounds at 4.025-4.035, it is naturally a threat to free pounds, so the British side firmly believes that although the free pound market is still open every day in New York, it will disappear in the near future.</p>

<p>After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, Japan's foreign trade deteriorated greatly due to the sharp increase in the import of military raw materials. In order to improve the situation, it strengthened exchange controls and implemented the Temporary Measures Law for Import and Export Goods to prevent the import of non-essential goods, and even imposed restrictions on the raw materials of the fiber industry, such as wool and cotton, which constitute the basis of Japan's export trade. After that, it implemented various trade policies to suppress imports and promote exports. However, the trade situation always looks good on the surface, but in essence it is extremely bad.

<p>The coal briquette market, due to differences of opinion among peers, changes in the morning and evening, and several markets a day, making people dizzy and at a loss. Yesterday, the inter-dealer dismantling fell to a low of 100 yuan.

<p>Medicine King Bodhisattva</p>
<p>Whenever I see village women entering the city, they worship every temple they encounter, and every worship is accompanied by chanting scriptures. But in fact, when they enter the door, they don't even see what is written on the plaque. They generally say Bodhisattva, not knowing whether it is Buddha, Tao, or Confucian ancestor. But it is not only women, rumors are untrue, and customs are followed, even scholars follow suit. The Buddhist scriptures have Medicine King Bodhisattva, Medicine Superior Bodhisattva, and Medicine Master Buddha. I don't know if they are the same or different. But I heard that people in the world regard Medicine King as Shennong. Provincial capitals and prefectures often have temples. Doctors and medicine merchants raise money to pay their respects, or celebrate the birth of the god, or patrol to drive away epidemics, and collect money for temple fairs. The name is Medicine King, but the matter is Shennong. Is it one or two? I don't know either. Suppose Medicine King is Shennong, then is Medicine Superior Bodhisattva Qibo? It is also said that Medicine Master Buddha can eliminate disasters and prolong life. On people's birthdays, they decline relatives and friends to celebrate and invite monks to worship the Medicine Master Repentance. However, the Medicine Master Lamp thinks that Medicine Master specializes in prolonging life, and generally it is the same heart and situation as Medicine King's saving diseases. It should be a different name for Medicine King. The world worships Medicine King, but does not know where it is based on. However, the customs are like this, and it is impossible to recover. It is not surprising to worship him. As for mistakenly celebrating the birth of the god, it is even more absurd. If Medicine King is Shennong, the Road History Bamboo Book and the Historical Records of the Emperors, when describing before Tang and Yu, never mentioned his birth on which day. Today, the people of Tianjin roar and take April 16 as his birthday. According to what book does it say so?</p>

<h3 id="e98">Past Graces of Summer Living <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Mei</p>
<p>Bamboo Wife: Since the eastward spread of European customs, the inherent things of our country have been eliminated one by one. For example, the bamboo wife used in summer, I was born late, and I have not had time to see its production; I heard from the late Mr. Sun Shoushiyun: "The bamboo wife is made of Qing bamboo pieces with a width of four or five points, and a length of about three feet. The diameter of the circumference is about six or seven inches, and the whole body is made into a plum blossom pattern, and the air is shared in the middle. In summer nights, it is placed on the mat. When lying down, the arm is clasped to sleep, and those who are fat can make the armpits cool and free from the pain of dirty sweat steaming the skin. In the old days, it was used by people in giant families. Su Dongpo has a poem saying: 'Give you a silent bamboo wife,' which is this thing. It has been around since the Song Dynasty, and its system is very detailed. There are some of these in Shanghai in the bamboo shops on Miezhu Street outside the Dadongmen of Nanshi, and the bamboo craftsmen who make this are clever craftsmen who make dumplings and wontons. The whole body must be unusually shiny and the ends must be hidden. All the joints of the two bamboo strips are embedded in the bottom of the bamboo strips, so that people do not feel prickly. The technique is very precise." According to Mr. Xu Yuedan, "In the past, Guangdong changed the bamboo system to a lacquer leather system, with no connection at both ends, like a long pillow, called a hug pillow." I have not been able to see even this hug pillow, which is really ashamed. The bamboo wife is seen in the books of the predecessors, such as Wu Meicun's Nankeziyun: "Jade bones are fragrant and sweatless, and the two ends are exchanged. They are overturned and hooked, but there is no more Yang belly, so it is romantic. Short and slippery, exquisite and full of sorrow, some personalities are not gentle, afraid of being thrown away in the late autumn." Also, Zhang Juzheng of the Ming Dynasty was hot and restless, and a certain official flattered him and specially made a bamboo wife woven from Xiang bamboo, inlaid with jade to form a pair of mandarin ducks, full of cool and fragrant medicines, smelling the heart and spleen, and Juzheng was very happy. The official was promoted to prominence, which was the power of the bamboo wife. I also heard people say: In the Qing Palace, there was a Qianlong bamboo wife, not made of bamboo, but woven of ivory. Because of the sweat stains on the hands, the color was translucent like red jade, but it was not exhibited in the exhibition of cultural relics in the Forbidden City, and now I don't know where it is lost. What a pity!</p>
<p>Bamboo Shirt: The bamboo shirt is made of fine bamboo and tied with thread to form a square Sheng pore, which is unusually cool. The weaving is extremely fine, otherwise it will be prickly and painful, and the function will be lost. In this summer, dressing neatly and going out to entertain, if the body is not padded, the sweat will penetrate, and it will become a sweaty scholar, which is very unsightly. There were no undershirts and other things at that time, so I had to borrow this bamboo shirt as a lining. Because it is a commonly used product, there are often craftsmen on the streets and alleys who repair bamboo shirts for people, just like the current repair of parasols. Since the sweat shirt has risen, no one uses the bamboo shape anymore; however, the martial students who perform dramas still use bamboo shirts in the summer, because they are prone to sweating through heavy clothes. Besides, it is not often seen. According to legend, there was a bamboo shirt of Qing Zhu Zhuyu, a lyricist, which was unusually exquisite. The fine bamboo was carved with ice plum patterns. The price of things at that time was very low, but this bamboo shirt cost eighty gold, which was offered by a certain student as a congratulatory gift. Those who were frugal all thought that this person was unheard of.</p>
<h3 id="e99">One Way to Make a Straw Hat New <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>— Qishi</p>
<p>A straw hat is an indispensable item for going out in the summer. The price is high after the war, and there are many inferior goods. If you simply discard the old and replace it with a new one every year, it is not economical and it is against your conscience. Now there is a method that can make the straw hat new. The method is simple and cheap, and it has been tested by the poor for two years. I dare to introduce it to the readers of this series as follows:</p>
<p>Take a small amount of high-quality stain (dirt) powder used to wipe the basin, etc., and dip a clean old toothbrush into it, mix with an appropriate amount of water, and carefully brush the surface of the green straw hat, making sure that it covers everything. Then use water to wash away the mixture of stain (dirt) powder and dirt, while brushing with a toothbrush. If there are still gray and dirty places, repeat the above method until it is completely clean. Let it dry, and you're done. At this point, the past yellow dirt is as new as ever. The cost is much lower than the cleaning fee. Readers may wish to try it.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Chatting About Ice Cream <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>— Ying Dai</p>
<p>As soon as summer unfolds, the cold drink market in Shanghai also unfolds. Among the cold drink foods, generally speaking, ice cream is the most popular. In European and American countries, ice cream is eaten all year round, and the market is of course larger in summer. In China, although ice cream can be bought in winter, not many people eat it. It is not until summer that people buy it to eat.</p>
<p>Just talking about Shanghai, if we make a statistics of the sales volume of ice cream every summer, I am afraid it will be very amazing, right? Among people who love to eat ice cream, we can see that there are more women than men, and most children love to eat ice cream. Under this circumstance, the sales of ice cream naturally increase year by year.</p>
<p>Watermelon was originally a summer food for Chinese people, but in recent years, due to the Sino-Japanese War, Shanghai has become an "isolated island", and the price of watermelon is several times higher than before the war. Most people feel the pain of not being able to afford watermelon? So go and buy ice cream. In fact, ice cream is not necessarily cheaper, but because it is not necessary to buy the whole watermelon, the money is taken out in small pieces, so of course it is not felt.</p>
<p>These days, when we walk to the market, which tobacco shop, candy store, or food store does not open another department to sell cold drinks, and ice cream has become their main selling product. Some people even set up temporary cold drink stalls to sell ice cream. The signs and flags of ice cream are hung everywhere, which has really turned into a world of ice cream!</p>
<p>The main raw materials of ice cream are milk, egg sugar, these things. Due to the high cost in recent years, the price has also risen more than double last year. It is said that making ice cream is very profitable. In the big cities of Europe and the United States, there are many rich people who started their careers because of ice cream. Shanghai's Hai Ning Yanghang now monopolizes the ice cream market.</p>
<p>But although ice cream can relieve summer heat and quench thirst, it should not be eaten too much. If you eat too much, you will easily get sick and cause changes in the stomach. Especially women, if they drink too much, they will have hidden diseases in their physiology. As for cheap and inferior ice cream, it is even more unsuitable to eat. We should keep the so-called "ice cream" in mind and not buy inferior ice cream for cheap, otherwise it will cause problems.</p>
<h3 id="e101">The Three Pests of Summer <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>— New Formula</p>
<p>We all know that mosquitoes, flies, and bedbugs are the three pests of summer. As we enter the height of summer, it is also the rampant season for these three types of pests. Therefore, we should know how to defend against them. If we have more common knowledge about them, I think at least you can add a layer of protection to your body. Below, I will share what I know with everyone in a disorganized manner.</p>
<p>Mosquitoes: The common disease called malaria is caused by a type of Anopheles mosquito as its pathogen. Anopheles mosquitoes differ from ordinary mosquitoes in two ways: 1. Anopheles mosquitoes have a slanted body when resting, while ordinary mosquitoes are flat. 2. Anopheles mosquitoes have spots on their wings, while ordinary mosquitoes do not. As for mosquito prevention methods, the basic condition is that everyone should pay attention to hygiene. In addition, burning mosquito coils and pouring kerosene in sewage areas can also eliminate mosquitoes and their larvae. Regarding mosquitoes, there is a terrifying statistic: in Siam, the number of people who die from mosquitoes each year exceeds the number of people who die from tigers by as much as a hundred times. The harm of mosquitoes to humans is evident from this.</p>
<p>Flies: A pair of flies can produce 300 million offspring in a single summer. This rate of reproduction is truly terrifying. Therefore, the work of extermination also needs to be actively carried out. If you have spare time, you may also gather a few companions to form a fly-swatting team. Flypaper, fly swatters, and other tools are used to directly kill adult flies. In toilets or on piles of filth where fly larvae breed, we need to use borax, kerosene, lime, etc., to pour on them in order to eliminate them. Every year, when summer arrives, the health authorities always remind people not to eat food that has been touched by flies, because many seasonal diseases such as dysentery and cholera are mostly directly transmitted by flies. We must pay attention to this. Do not disregard your own precious body for the sake of temporary greed.</p>
<p>Bedbugs: Their bodies are flat and small, so they are extremely difficult to catch. When the human body is stung by this insect, it often feels itchy and painful. At this time, if you apply boric acid water or vinegar, then you will no longer feel itchy and painful. Recently, there are many newly released bedbug-killing agents on the market, and it is said that their effectiveness is quite good.</p>
<p>Summer is the most terrible season. I hope everyone can cherish your body even more. "Being free from illness is a blessing." You need to take care of your own blessings yourself.</p>

<p>— Ms. Hua Ying</p>
<p>Among the summer vegetables, gourds occupy an important position, such as winter melon, cucumber, loofah, and the bitter melon that Cantonese people love to eat. A winter melon soup in a Cantonese restaurant is frighteningly expensive, but it is actually very simple to make at home and does not cost much money. You only need to buy a small winter melon, cut it into upper and lower halves, scoop out the seeds and pulp, put ten diced delicacies inside, and finally buy a set of chicken giblets or duck giblets, dice them, and add small pieces of ham, fragrant mushrooms, and side tips, add a little refined salt, cover tightly with fresh lotus leaves, steam until cooked, and when eating, uncover the lotus leaves, the aroma is pleasant, and the ten diced delicacies in the melon are all cooked through, soft and delicious, and the soup is especially fresh and delicious. In summer meat dishes, it can indeed proudly take the top spot.</p>

<p>— Long Ju Sheng</p>
<p>Under the scorching sun, the intense heat is approaching. Sitting in a cramped room, I still feel sweat pouring out like a slurry, frequently calling out for heat. Driven by hunger, I run under the fiery canopy of the sun, those laborers and rickshaw pullers! And the toiling masses? These people carry heavy loads on their shoulders, speeding on the scorching asphalt roads. Their toes are cracked, and their skin is like being burned. What a painful thing that is! I saw the Salvation Army's tea-giving car and rice-giving car stopping by the roadside, giving them immeasurable grace. The laborers, rickshaw pullers, and toiling masses regard them as saviors of their hungry stomachs. People rush to them as if drinking fine wine, as if drinking benevolent nectar, as if reborn! Giving tea and rice can truly be called benevolent nectar and righteous grain. The gentlemen of the Salvation Army, are they also the contemporary counterparts of the woman who fed Han Xin? I am moved by this, so I dip my brush and record it, hoping that the wealthy people on this isolated island will drink a few fewer glasses of iced milk coffee, eat a few fewer cups of lemon ice cream, eat a few fewer servings of cold noodles with shredded chicken, quickly generously contribute with benevolence, and transfer it to the good deeds of giving tea and rice, then it will truly be immeasurable merit!</p>
<h3 id="e106">Talking About Wine <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>— Qiu Lang</p>
<p>Wine occupies an important part in the character for "good". Although it is one of the wasteful luxuries, it is always indispensable when there are celebrations and mourning ceremonies. Even in peacetime, friends drink together, buy drunkenness in the market, relatives and friends come and go, and families enjoy themselves, it relies on it as an introduction. Drinkers say even better: "Three cups harmonize all things, a drunken state dissolves a thousand sorrows!" Drinking is not a sin in itself, but it is feared by the word "addiction". With "addiction", one gets drunk early and gets intoxicated late, neglecting public duties, and drinking too much hurts the brain, and the dampness is also extremely heavy. It is very easy to develop dampness diseases. It is best to eat a few cups during festivals and social occasions, which is still harmless. In fact, at this time when the national crisis is severe, other diets still need to be saved, and of course, one should not drink alcohol! The author will roughly excerpt a few pieces about the various types of wine for the readers to enjoy.</p>
<p>Types of wine: There are many types of wine. In terms of domestically produced wines, the most famous in the country is Shaoxing wine. This is certainly due to the perfection of the brewing method, but most of it is also due to the purity of the Jianhu water in the Shaoxing area. It is said that this fine wine cannot be brewed if the location is changed. In addition, Fenjiu from Shanxi is also very well-known. As for sorghum liquor, because of its potency, most of those who like to drink it are from the laboring class, taking it because it is easy to get addicted. As for fruits that can be used to make wine, there are also many, too many to list. Several medicinal wines in Chinese medicine shops are used to activate muscles and bones and treat diseases, which is an exception. When it comes to imported wines, there are also: brandy, beer, whiskey, and so on. However, after the European War, due to transportation difficulties, prices soared. Fortunately, Changyu Company has already produced several domestically produced imitations, which can indeed recover a lot of rights and interests.</p>
<p>Wine stories: There are also many stories about wine, none better than Li Bai's: "Li Bai writes a hundred poems after drinking a bushel of wine, the emperor calls him but he does not board the boat, claiming that he is a wine immortal." It has been passed down as a good story throughout the ages. And for magnanimity and boldness, Liu Ling should be pushed forward. When he drank, he brought a hoe-carrying person with him, meaning that when he was drunk and fell, he would be buried on the spot! In addition, there are Sima Xiangru's exchange of sable fur for wine, and the white-clothed person delivering wine, two tangerines and a bushel of wine, etc., which are also too numerous to enumerate, but they are all deeds that have been broadcast as beautiful stories in history.</p>
<p>Wine quotes: Confucius said: "Only wine is unlimited, but not to the point of chaos." Zhu Xi said, "Do not drink excessive amounts of wine." It can be seen that although sages have no words prohibiting eating, they always persuade people to eat less and not to be excessive. As the proverb says, "Wine is a poison that pierces the intestines," "Wine does not intoxicate people, people intoxicate themselves," "Wine is a medium for lust," and the Buddhist sect's "abstaining from wine and removing meat," either based on cautious eating and seriousness, or based on abstaining from killing and hygiene, these are all warnings to people!</p>
<p>Literati and wine: Drinking alcohol is indeed more harmful than beneficial to the human body, but people prefer to drink alcohol, especially the literati and scholars, who have a connection with koji medicine. And they beautify it by saying: "Poetry and wine linger," like the famous line of the poet sage Li Qinglian when drinking alone: "Raise a glass to invite the bright moon, face my shadow and make three people," his interest is so high, drinking should choose a secluded place, the best is under flowers and moon, sip slowly and gently, in a permanent pavilion, hold the cup and drink a little, wait for slight drunkenness and slight consciousness, after that, either write a topic and chant separately, or connect beautiful lines, feel more happiness, endless fun, compared to the vulgar who only know how to swallow cattle and drink, specializing in drunkenness and causing trouble, cannot be compared.</p>

<h3 id="e107">Silver and Money Industry Colleagues Consumer Cooperative First Anniversary <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>— Lai Tian</p>
<p>If readers are not forgetful, I think they must still remember that this newspaper published an article about the consumer cooperative organized by colleagues in the silver and money industry in this city on this day last year. At that time, this consumer cooperative was also the first day of operation. Today, this year, she has worked hard for a year in a difficult environment.</p>
<p>Since the National Army withdrew to the west of Shanghai, evil forces took the opportunity to invade, control, manipulate, hoard... and other means, causing the cost of living to soar and plunge the lives of four or five million citizens into the abyss of suffering, especially the general salary class, which was even more threatened. The colleagues in the silver and money industry, who are known as the "golden rice bowl," also first organized a self-help consumer cooperative due to objective needs. With the great spirit of "everyone for me, I for everyone," they united more than 2,000 colleagues, jointly collected small amounts of capital, and fully exerted their service effectiveness.</p>
<p>On the occasion of her first anniversary, we have briefly written down the situation of the past year's hard work, according to what the author knows, which I don't think is superfluous.</p>
<p>The colleagues in the silver and money industry, in view of the imbalance between their own lives and incomes, urgently need an organized cooperative group to reduce the burden of life for their colleagues. In April last year, with the active preparation of dozens of enthusiastic colleagues and the enthusiastic support of all the financial seniors, the consumer cooperative was formally established, soliciting more than 2,000 members, with shares reaching more than 6,000 yuan, and then started business on the third floor of 334 Nanjing Road on July 30 last year.</p>
<p>In the past year, her turnover was about 30,000 yuan, of which the number of coal balls accounted for a part, and the rest were mostly daily necessities. In terms of pricing, she has always adhered to the eclecticism, so that members have the opportunity to reduce their burdens. The work of purchasing goods is also related to the future of the entire consumer cooperative, so in principle, it is directly purchased from the manufacturers, such as China Chemical Industry Society, Wuhe Weaving Factory, Yitaixing Coal Ball Factory, Guanshengyuan, Taikang... What is regrettable is that many manufacturers do not give consumer cooperatives special preferential rights, but in terms of quantity, it is of course a huge number of about 33,000 yuan.</p>
<p>In addition, she also did general welfare work for the silver and money industry: such as responding to the Shanghai People's Food Maintenance Association and the Shanghai People's Food Regulation Association, and handling small-amount (changed from a minimum of fifty packages to one package) group ordering of foreign rice; and user coal ball pre-purchase method, to maximize the adjustment and service of the necessities of life for members.</p>
<p>Consumer cooperatives in big cities, because of commercial competition, were originally unable to defeat large commercial capitalists with huge funds, but the efforts of the silver and money industry consumer cooperative are not too disappointing to us. Last year, the member purchase dividend was also four cents per yuan, in fact, it has given members the beautiful fruit of "saving without saving."</p>
<p>Recently, during the grand anniversary special offer, she is selling all the goods at a uniform discount, with the intention of commemorating the glorious history of mutual assistance and cooperation among members over the past year, and also giving non-members a very good image, only everyone can sincerely cooperate, to relieve all difficulties and economic oppression.</p>

<p>— Wei Kang</p>
<p>I heard that an American recently invented a movie that promotes appetite. Watching this movie can increase appetite. Now the price of rice is soaring on this isolated island. If this movie comes to Shanghai, then the price of rice may soar even more. But if someone can invent a movie that makes people lose their appetite and not eat, then the price of rice will definitely fall sharply. I think this is the most effective way to suppress the price of rice.</p>
<p>Hawthorne Detective Cases</p>
<h3 id="e110">The Overnight Stay of the Dance Queen <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter Four Kind of Deduction</p>
<p>Hawthorne shook his head and said slowly, "I can't accept it. There are two contradictions in this: First, the pistol was shot in from the window, not like it was shot in this room. The sitting posture of the corpse, the bullet hole in the back of the chair, and the bullet on the wall are all clear evidence. Second, we already know that not long after the shot was fired, the three people in the room were all awakened. Judging from the situation, Jinmei and Li Zhiban, after hearing the gunshot, got up, put on their clothes, and went down two flights of stairs to get here, which would probably take no more than three or four minutes at most. Even if the murderer fired the shot inside, in this short period of time, that person would have to hide the pistol, take the bracelet from the deceased's wrist, the ring from his finger, and the earrings from his ears, and then escape, and when escaping, the old man would not hear the sound of his feet, so it can be seen that his steps must not have been too fast, so wouldn't the time be too tight?"</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou nodded secretly and said, "Judging from the injuries of the deceased, the shooter may indeed have been standing outside the short wall to shoot."</p>
<p>Hawthorne nodded and said, "That's right, there's no doubt about it. The first contradiction can be explained. But how to explain the disappearance of the jewelry?"</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou scratched his scalp and said hesitantly, "Maybe—maybe he rushed in to steal her jewelry after firing the shot."</p>
<p>Hawthorne shook his head repeatedly and said, "No, no. You're too confused! The second contradiction I just mentioned is the time problem. Assuming that this person fired the shot in the room and stole the jewelry at random, the time is still too tight. How can you say that he could rush in after firing the shot outside? And the two rows of footprints are neat and orderly, and there is no sound, and it doesn't look like he was rushing, but like he was walking step by step."</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou patted his own forehead and said in frustration, "It's killing me! This kind of case is really too complicated!"</p>
<p>At this time, I suddenly thought of another opinion: "Hawthorne, do you think it's possible that the person who fired the shot and the person with the footprints are two people? The person with the A imprint just came in, and the person outside happened to fire the shot, and the person with the A imprint hurriedly took something and ran away?"</p>
<p>Hawthorne looked up at me and didn't express his opinion. However, even though he didn't express it, he clearly had some sympathy, because he didn't refute it.</p>
<p>He said to himself again, "This question is indeed troubling. Judging from the situation, it looks very much like a jealousy killing, and at the same time, it looks like a murder for money. I really can't find a reasonable explanation now. In addition, the key on the drawer and the banknotes in the drawer, none of them can be understood now... Brother Jinshou, I think it's better to seek some practical facts than to sit and talk about theories." Ni Jinshou said, "How do you plan to proceed?" (59)</p>
<h3 id="e111">We Await Good News <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>— Person</p>
<p>About Labor Disputes</p>
<p>The newspapers on the 23rd of this month carried a message that the central authorities were quite concerned about the frequent labor disputes in Shanghai, which made us feel very excited: The central authorities pointed out that "in this extraordinary period, labor and management should share the same boat in the storm and adhere to the spirit of coordination and cooperation." This is something that everyone supports.</p>
<p>In the central government's "Wartime Economic Regulations", it is forbidden to go slow or strike; but we know that in the past one or two years, almost all the go-slow and strike events in Shanghai were caused by the high prices and the failure of the labor side to ask the management side to improve their treatment: we only need to look at the many commercial firms that have automatically improved the lives of their employees, and there have been no labor disputes. This point is even intimately understood by the central authorities thousands of miles away, and the instructions say: "As for the high prices and the difficulties in the livelihoods of the workers, the management side should accept the workers' demands within the possible range, or automatically improve them." I think the wise Shanghai management side should sincerely support this instruction! Also, the same day's newspaper reported that the concession authorities also attached great importance to the labor disputes. It is said that "...at present, the authorities have initially investigated the living standards of various public utilities and factories. If they are indeed meager and difficult to maintain a living, they should discuss improvements with the management authorities to avoid pretexts for strikes." We believe that the concession authorities have done a great deal in the past one or two or three years to resolve labor-management disputes in the concession, but in the past, they still belonged to treating the symptoms, and now there has been a further cure for the root cause. This will make the workers in the concession, and even all the citizens, feel happy, and will even more sincerely support the concession authorities.</p>
<p>Therefore, we await good news.</p>
