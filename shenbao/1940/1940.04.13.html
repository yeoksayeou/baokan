<p>社評</p>
<h3>美匯之前途</h3>
<p>近一週來，爲歐戰發生劇烈之變動，德國據丹麥攻挪威，舉世騷然，人心惶惑；英美滙兌因世局緊張而頻縮，尤使上海人士，對於美金之蓄積，鼓舞勇氣，倍增興趣；需求旣殷，其價自昂。抑又豈僅中國爲然，各國黃金，旣以美國爲唯一安全寄托所，世界金融，又唯美金爲最可信任之通貨，宜其有戞戞獨造之觀矣。雖然，美國旣擁有鉅量黄金，無論其中一部分之性質乃爲歐洲各國所寄存，然善爲措置運用，則美國之事。及今美金昂貴如是，此爲美國所可自豪，而其可能之困難亦復叢集，則爲世人所不可不知者也。</p>
<p>夫美金之所以貴，正爲美金之需求鉅，美金之所以需求鉅，一則歐戰爆發，歐洲諸國軍械等項求之於美國者多，亦即需要支出之美金自多。再則世界不安之範圍愈擴大，則各地資金謀逃避於美國者愈甚，凡有所儲，儲美金，有所用，用美金，美金幾成爲世界標凖通貨，行市安得而不堅昂。夫通貨之爲物，不宜過貴，亦不宜過賤；過貴足以阻礙物產向外之流通，過賤則增加一般內在生活之困難。今各國之貨幣，雖　各自爲政，務加統制，頗能各自維持其名義上之水準；而事實上，固有不勝其維持，惟有任其自然升降，乃致市况參差者。如央美滙兌，在倫敦猶爲四元有零，而在紐約，只爲三元四角有奇；蓋倫敦之英美滙價，名價也，紐約之英美滙價，實價也；在今日之英國，決非能力不足以維持英鎊價格之名實齊一，祗以戰時，斯不以此爲務耳。</p>
<p>美金誠貴矣，是爲美金之信用强，宜可喜。然　美金貴，即爲各國購買之美貨亦貴；美貨而貴，則用美貨者將因其昂貴而改用比美貨較廉之貨物；或甚至節制而不用。此在美國如欲保持其對外之正常貿易，非將物價减低，即應將幣値抑低，以爲應付。但此兩者均有其困難，减低物價，則國內工商業勢必引爲不安。且美國近年來對於工商金融之措施，要在促進工商業之對外發展，維持國際滙兌於穩定；雖世界事變之來，有不容如是做去，但美國至今仍不失爲狂瀾中之砥柱，固有不容輕事更張者在也。况今各國戰時所需之各種接濟，正惟美國是求，無論美金縮，美貨貴，若所需舍美國而不可多得，則雖貴亦惟有向美國求之。抑又小僅戰時而已，他日停戰之後，一切物資之有求於美國幫助者尙多，是以各國所存於美國價値百萬萬美元之黄金，或竟漸次移轉而成爲美國所有；例如日本在美原有存金，乃因中國持久抗戰之結果，使日人盡耗其所存，蓋美貨售日，源源不絕，即是日金償美，漸漸告罄。歐戰各國對美亦然。惟換一方面觀之，美金如堅昂不稍鬆，而各國持有金量亦日少，則美國正常對外之輸出，必將遭遇絕大之打擊。例如最近上海呢絨業之英國定貨，一時大爲活躍；而對義大利之定貨，轉爲淸淡：此無它，英金平，美金緊，用英金定貨較用美金定貨爲廉，而義貨須用美金結價；於是改向用英幣定貨矣。即此一端，雖未足以槪其餘。然如中國對外貿易，在戰前以美國居首位，戰後大爲低落，此其原因多端，而美滙暴縮，美貨本重，其重要原因之一也。美金之貴，旣不限於中國一隅，他國皆然；則美國工商業除軍事工業以外，終必有感覺局面沉悶之一日，而求所以打通開塞之道，將必就物價與幣價之間擇一而抑低之，始得稍事調劑；此外，惟有向外投資之一途，以謀疏散其雄厚之資金。茲固不悉美國如何爲計，然同時數管齊下，斟酌應付，亦自有其可能；非惟可能，爲美國計，且有其必要。於是論之，今之沉溺於美滙者，亦應知所應止矣。</p>

<h3>北歐海面一塲鏖戰　德艦隊成「殘廢」　幾已喪失其全部之什一　邱吉爾報吿英海軍戰績</h3>
<p>倫敦　英海相邱吉爾昨在下院報吿海戰時謂、余必認德國海軍在重要點上現已殘廢、余以爲德海軍冒險而付重大代價之行動、僅爲陸地所將發生的更大事件之先兆、惟吾人已準備抵禦敵方之最大危害、將傾注吾人生命與力量、以成就舉世共需之勝利、德海軍今已遭甚重大之損失、挪威砲隊已收創敵之功、余以爲希特勒將戰事擴至北方、而使斯坎的那維亞半島人民不得不改變其中立態度、星期日以來、德巡艦四艘的佔其戰前力量之半者現已沉失、而驅逐艦與潛艇亦皆各損失多艘云、（十二日路透電）</p>
<p>倫敦　路透社海軍訪員稱、本週海戰中、英德雙方損失、此刻尙不能作準確比較、惟的略估計、可認明邱吉爾所發「德國艦隊在要點現已殘廢」一語之正確、據現有情報察之、戰前德方有巡洋艦八艘與驅逐艦三十艘、今巡洋艦已失其四、而驅逐艦已確知喪失者三艘、另有二三艘殆亦沉沒、此外復損失潛艇數艘、及供應船十餘艘、父查德艦受傷者有戰艦與巡洋艦各一及驅逐艦數艘、據目前估計、英國戰前有驅遂艦的一百六十艘、今失四艘、並有驅逐艦二艘與戰鬥巡洋艦一艘負傷云、（十二日路透電）</p>
<h3>邱吉爾　演辭全文　（續完）</h3>
<p>昨夜薄暮最後一次之襲擊中、敵方以飛機六十架如潮浪之接續攻擊、吾人毫未受有損失、而敵機至少曾被擊落六架、（衆歡呼）此其功績實由於砲隊之得力、及空軍會合應戰之得法、吾人艦隊之得安泊斯加巴灣、此爲極關重要者、而德機之屢次攻擊、實使吾人砲隊得機練習其轟擊飛機砲術、蓋吾人從未能獲得活動砲靶之如此者也、（歡呼與笑聲並作）</p>
<p>今當述及斯加巴灣以外之事矣、吾人在作冒險行動時、當然準備受意外之損失、吾人之飛機曾在北海全部從事偵察、星期日之夜、據報德戰鬥巡洋艦一艘及其他巡洋艦驅逐艦若干艘、方疾駛北上、吾艦隊接報、立即在斯加巴灣準備一切、總司令亦即出海躬自指揮各艦、同時另有强大之英海軍一隊、追迫那維克港、以圖在挪威海濱一帶外敷設水雷區、以求達余頃述之目的、星期一日拂曉、依照預定計劃、將水窗敷設吿竣、於是埋雷艦即撤退、以避免有與維持挪威中立之挪軍艦發生衝突之虞、驅逐艦「螢」號於星期日下午北上加入艦隊時、而於星期一日晨八時瞭見第一敵驅逐艦、繼又見二艘、遂與交戰焉、</p>
<p>該艦旋報吿北方有不知數之敵艦正在活動、凡此事端、每隔數分鐘報到、但最後之情報突然中斷、吾人乃料該艦與優勢之敵艦隊交戰、必已在戰中破沉矣、此遭遇戰表明敵海軍已有多數出臨海中、並表明許多事變已在進行中矣、自此戰事遂日夜進行、未有停頓、目下仍在進行之中、現已吾人尙未克挪威沿海之各口岸、故一切實在情形未能詳悉、報載消息固多、但皆爲來自中立方面之謠言、須稍遲始能得其眞相焉、</p>
<p>邱吉爾繼稱、茲余試將主要事件撮要以吿、星期一晨敵方艦隊、即擊沉英艦「螢」號而內有德方巡洋戰艦一艘與其他重要軍艦者、似可爲北面英艦隊與英方國內主要艦隊所包圍矣、而英方此兩艦隊亦皆較敵艦隊力量更厚、然而敵艦隊竟脫逃矣、諸君注視揷有小旗以示陣之地圖、或認爲必有某種結果、但若置身海上、則水天一色、一望無垠、波濤澎湃、烟霧迷漫、加以夜色蒼茫、敵艦踪跡不定、當此之時、諸君不能希望有如在陸地上可測定陸軍進退之狀况也、</p>
<p>星期二日、英艦隊在貝爾根以南巡邏時、遭德機不斷的攻擊、德方無綫電照常播送擊沉或重毀英國戰艦與巡艦若干艘之消息、但實則僅巡艦兩艘稍受不碍其工作之些微損毀、此兩艦今猶在艦隊中也、英旗艦「羅德尼」號被一大炸彈擊中、惟該艦艙面鐵甲至爲堅固雖遇爆炸、艦身無礙、僅傷艦員四人與水兵三人而已、以英國軍艦結構言、此事當認爲極堪滿意、（衆歡呼）英巡艦「奧羅拉」號遭轟炸機五次攻擊、然皆失敗、惟驅逐艦「葛卡」號被直接擊中、致艦身傾側、在四小時半後沉沒、所有艦員幾已悉數救起、星期二日午後英驅逐艦「蘇魯」號、在奧克內羣島外擊沉德潛艇一艘、星期二日淸晨、英巡洋戰艦「令名」號在那維克港外、遙見德巡洋戰艦「香霍斯特」號與萬噸巡艦一艘、其時海浪險惡、在風大作、「令名」號乃於相隔一萬八千碼處開砲遙擊、閱三分鐘後敵艦還擊、旋即轉輪疾駛、「令名」號在轟擊九分鐘後、見「香霍斯特」號前部已被擊中、不復還砲、僅後部開始還擊耳、該德艦速度甚大、「令名」號乃以二十四海里之速率破浪前進、再閱兩分鐘、該德艦有濃烟一縷向上直冲、殆已中第二彈、此時萬噸德巡艦在「香霍斯特」號後施入烟幕、於是兩德艦開足速度逃去云、</p>
<p>邱吉爾繼稱、英潛艇已擊沉大批德運輸艦及軍需船、所有在斯喀基拉克及加特格德之德國艦船、均將加以擊沉、迨至晚間遇有機會、一切敵方艦船均將在擊沉之列、吾人將不容許敵人毫無困難經過此項海面而接濟其陸軍、迄今已有敵方艦船十餘艘、其中有若干艘爲大型者、因企圖運輸給養於在那維克登陸之軍隊、在加特格德或北海其他部份被擊沉或遭俘獲、</p>
<p>就吾人星期二日深晚在海部所得之情報、吾人認爲軍事行動頗爲艱險、故於晨間一時通知某驅逐艦隊司令、命其全權判斷是否進攻、吾人對於彼之一切措施、及不論發生何種事故、均將加以支持、（衆歡呼）該司令即統率驅逐艦五艘前進、並攻擊敵方驅逐艦及岸上之砲隊、彼最初之報吿、僅提及吾方之損失、余當即予以宣布、因余意吾人對於此等事件、不應有所諱飾、旣從事戰爭、吾人自常準備接受打擊也、余於一時許接獲報吿後、即行送交首相、由彼立時向下院全國及報界宜布、吾人於接到任何消息之後、不論其爲凶爲吉、均將送交國會首相及各報、</p>
<p>吾人旋又接到報吿、知吾方各驅逐艦回航之時、曾與滿載後備軍火之敵船「萊文費爾特」號相遇、余料敵方大的欲藉此軍火化那維克爲堅强之堡壘、如西巴斯吐坡爾或直布羅陀然、該船當被擊沉、吾人必須承認此舉、將可减輕吾人當前之工作、</p>

<h3>熱烈競選已成過去　新董事定期就職　十八日就職互選總副董　各方對加捐案一致重視</h3>
<p>工部局董事競選、昨日開票結果、已以英五·美二·日二當選定局、仍維原狀、日方圖以選舉勝利獨佔租界之野心、至此粉碎無餘、回溯四年前即中華民國二十五年時、日方亦曾提出增加日董之要求、當時以英美態度强硬、未能達到目的、此次蓋爲第二度之失敗矣、惟日方雖經此一再失敗、其控制租界膏其饞吻之意慾、尙不甘默爾而息、必當繼續以合法進取輔助非法攫奪、同時以非法威脅促成合法進取、殆可無疑、是則有待於英美及第三國僑滬人士之善爲自處矣、</p>
<p>英美獲勝　人心大慰</p>
<p>日方在工部局董事競選之初、即決意撕毀英美日五二二比例之君子協定、曾對外揚言、謂已操「必勝之秘策、」連日利用其軍事政治特殊勢力、上下一心、向各方活動誘脅、其實力誠不可輕忽、但昨晨揭曉結果、竟爲英美擊倒、其對上海逐逐之慾、業已失敗、迨昨晨各報揭露此次勝利消息後、無間中外、人心大慰、熱烈希望英美當選之七董事、一秉其參加競選時之精神、服務租界之初衷、以數百萬華人之福利爲基點，而與五華董作密切聯絡、則在租界中第三國擁有之利益、不特可以確保、且租界之日趨繁榮、可立而待也、</p>

<p>日方失敗　後之言論</p>
<p>日方林雄吉（日僑選舉委員長）發表談話、其大略如下、「此次選舉、未能達到預期目的、誠屬憾事、本人身爲選舉委員長實覺無辭以對日本僑民諸君、吾人對於租界問邀、原主張拋除獨裁狀態、而尋眞正之「國際化」、使上海成爲理想的、</p>
<p>國際都市</p>
<p>藉以增進居民幸福、此種崇高主張、逈與利己主義者不同、不過選舉上最關重要者、不在於勝敗誰屬、而在於政綱之正確、吾人爲貫徹其合理主張、今後將倍增其努力、繼續奮鬥、以底於成、此次選舉、果吾係公正而妥當之方法舉行、以及現行選舉制度不合理之點、今後務宜</p>
<p>充分檢討</p>
<p>並應另採適當手段、以謀改正、吾人絕不因此次選舉結果、灰其心志、爲來年選舉中捲土重來計、自今日起、應即開始準備云、林雄吉此項談話、至少具有半官性質、「雄心」未死、固可想見、又日大使館發言人、昨日對西報記者稱、「日本政府終極之目的、乃在廢止此間之領事裁判權及租界權力、但</p>
<p>此項理想</p>
<p>絕難一時成功、不得已而求其次、遂有改進公共租界行政之圖、工董競選、今已揭曉、但其經過曲折、尙待　查、日人欲在工部局獲取優越地位之希望、始終不變、余更希望以合法手續、達到此種願望、但此語並非暗示的採用種種不合法手段、</p>
<p>英美僑民</p>
<p>以爲洋涇浜地皮章程之修改、今日尙非其時、以日方視之、實極不合理、此項章程之建立、始於一八四六年·在世界飛速進步之狀况下、舊有之章程、自絕難適合目前之需要云云、此外、渠又對工董代表人數、以財產爲標準之原則、予以攻擊、渠稱、「世界進化吾人應</p>
<p>重視人口</p>
<p>而非財產、但上海墨守成規、實足驚異、倘此種原則而能成立、則工部局由富翁九人掌管一切可也」、最後、發言人又表示願向各中選者道賀、謂「選舉原屬一種競賽、雙方均應保持其競賽者之人格也」、</p>
<p>通宵開票　情形追述</p>
<p>前日下午三時、福州路萬國商團操線塲及虹口小菜塲兩區同時截止投票後、在萬國商團操練塲之監察員勃倫茲（挪威人）即命助理員將第二·第四號票櫃兩具，移至工部局會議室、同時開始檢查登記表及許可證、半小時後、虹口小菜塲之監票員勃林格特（瑞典人）亦至、並由日捕印捕舁來一號·三號·票櫃二具、及至五時許、始行啟櫃開票、參加開票工作者、計有助理十六人、其中日籍者二人、當時會議室即行關閉、門外加派西捕·印捕·華捕·日捕·巡察、檢票工作、直至昨晨三時廿分始吿竣事、工部局高級職員如總辦費利溥、副總辦葛勃·會辦納喜·助理愛倫·及情報室主任福蘭善、均澈夜辦公、尤以局方特派之選舉事務助理員、以彼須隨時受監票人之諮詢、工作最爲緊張、直至昨晨四時、始吿畢事、</p>
<p>英美外僑　應知省悟</p>
<p>路透社十二日重慶電、新華日報今晨社評、向外國警吿、略稱、昨日上海公共租界工部局醫理事選舉、應使各國明瞭日本稱霸中國而完全排斥外國利益之意嚮、上海現局乃外國封日本取安協政策之直接結果、已往二年半來、日方有所要求、工部局均予接受、惟局方每作讓步日方必隨之提出新要求、日方目的、端在排斥第三國在華權益、此次競選、僅日方程序之一部份耳、英美此刻雖能維持現狀、惟日方勢必施加更强之壓力、殆可斷言、旅華外僑為保全其自己之在華權益計、皆應敦促其本國政府改變政策、予中國以物質上援助、俾得有効的遏止日方之侵略、</p>

<p>日言代表　意興闌珊</p>
<p>又再度當選之三井物產會社經理塙雄太郞答覆記者稱、「吾人已盡力爲之、今吿失敗、殊可扼腕」、記者問警務處恢復管理蘇州河北岸一事、將吾因此展緩、塙雄答稱、「金意不然、此乃另一事件」、又據日本律師岡本公一聲稱、旣已落選、不欲多談、惟並不感覺特殊驚奇、蓋日籍候選人二名、勢必落選、特不能預言何人落選耳、此乃無可挽回者云、</p>
<p>凱自威之　雋妙答覆</p>
<p>得票最多之英籍候選人凱自威亦不願有所表示又當選之亞細亞火油公司經理胞惠爾、在競選時、曾有工部局行政方針必須作更佳的宣傳等語、據答記者稱、「余不識君、未便電話中發表此種性質之言論」、</p>

<p>自由談	逸聞高爾基的信件  導鴻　　高爾基逝世後，蘇聯政府隨即設立一機關，專門搜集與他有關的文件，以便供研究高爾基者的參考。　　他一生寫給親友羣眾的信件，及各界致他的書信，已由該機關加以搜集，成爲各類文件中的主要類別之一，他寫給別人的信件，現已集有五千封之多。高爾基在世時，曾經同朋友偶然的說過，一直到那個時候，他至少已寫過二萬封信。（從說這句話時到他死的時候，不知又寫了若干封信了）。這些信件的大部分，在他及他的革命同志被沙皇的秘密警察逮捕被迫害的時候，爲警察所沒收，燒燬；現在是無法搜集了。　　他寫的信好像是詩，也好像是散文，令人百讀不厭。　　同青年作家通訊，他總坦白地警告他們，什麼事足以妨礙他們的進步。然而，他並不是僅僅警告就算了事的，同時還明白地指示他們，怎樣去做一個好的作家；真不愧是一個嚴正而熱情的教師。他常常勸青年作家們，準備做一點編輯「俄國內戰史」及「十九世紀青年史」兩書的工作。這兩部有歷史價值的偉大的巨著，是集體的寫作，現已居蘇聯出版。　　高爾基同許多世界著名作家之間，保存着永恒的崇高的友誼。在現在已搜集到的人家給他的四萬封信中，有許多是名聞世界的作家親筆寫的。如羅曼羅蘭·巴比塞·蕭柏納·辛克萊·紀德·法朗士及馬克吐溫等。　　寫信給高爾基，不僅是與他地位適合職務有關的作家，書店，編輯先生和社會團體；而且與他素不相識的各地民眾，也給他不少的信。　　高爾基對於各方的來信，不問是有名的作家也好，給他稿費的書店也好，催索稿件的編者也好，抑素不相識的民眾也好，總一樣的予以重視。這只要看他給一般不相識的民眾的熱情懇摯的覆信，就會相信的。　　下面是他寫給某集體農塲的一個名叫阿萊的農民的一封信，一封非常特色的信：　　「親愛的阿萊同志：你給我的信來得太遲；因之，我趕不上在你結婚的時候，向你賀喜。請原諒。現在，我在內心的深處向你致賀，並衷心地期望你和你的丈夫身體康健，愛情永久，協力工作，不斷學習，學業完成；我尤其希望你們不要爲了一點小事，而雙方吵得面紅耳赤。你應該竭盡力之所及，驅除一切不快的足以破壞你倆滿美的毒素：自大躁急……　　「最後，我熱望而且要再三的叮囑你同你的丈夫，務必先把身體好好地弄得強健起來；然後，你們才可以養上六個或者更多史太林主義的兒子；如他們的父母一樣，成爲社會主義生活的不屈不倦的建設者。敬謹問好。」耶穌與城市　（一）　　耶穌走橄欖山經過，看見前面的耶路撒冷城，聖殿鼓樓，矗立雲霄，各式各樣的建築物，呈現眼廉之前，凡以色列人見此，莫不踢躍三百，歡忻莫名。耶穌這樣呢，他從這燦爛的表面，看透全城的底層。他看明了牠的榮耀，也看明了牠的羞恥，看明了牠的快樂，也看明了牠的悲傷，看明了牠的罪惡，也看明了牠的困苦，看明了牠的財富，也看明了牠的貧窮，真的，凡全能的神所能見到的，他都見着了，分開來說，約有如下數端；（一）城中的矛盾，他看見耶路撒冷城有崇拜上帝的聖殿，也有敬奉撒但的廟宇。有態度敬虔，面現平安笑容的人，也有無惡不作，臉現罪孽之痕的人。有人辛苦守望，要救墜落者，也有人百般設計，要陷害無辜者。我們如有耶穌那樣的觀察力呢，也必能看出我們的城市與耶路撒冷城一樣的矛盾。我們城市中有喜有悲，有死有生，有祈禱有咒詛，有富人的「朱門酒肉臭」，有窮人的「野有餓死骨，」有音樂悠揚的舞塲，有待死監牢的囚犯，各種各類的矛盾，舉不勝舉。（二）城中的優點，耶穌看出耶路撒冷城中最優美的一點，就是那經得起火一殻的煅煉的宗教，真如純金一般，值得世人敬重。鄉間生活與城市不同，有的人在鄉村教會，是好教友，好執事，好主日學教員，一到城市，則大不如前。城市空氣，把他們星星燭光，很快的吹熄了。雖然，城市有不少的罪惡黑暗，但最大的信心，同情心，犧牲精神，一言以蔽之，愛神愛人的心，還是在城市中找着。因爲基督徒在城市環境中受了大試探，所以有機會發展他優美的人格。一個人被鐵鍊鎖着，自知無法脫身，卻面現笑容，這種態度，可說有英雄氣概，但基督徒的氣概，卻比這更偉大，也未曾被鐵鍊鎖着，隨時可以走開，只因念念不望自己的責任，堅立不動，讓火燒上心來，這是城市藉着神恩所煅煉出來的英雄行爲，也是城市最優美之點。　（待續）　如欲詳細研究請函郵箱一二二七號人物印度詩聖泰戈爾  李紹忠　　泰戈爾是印度近代唯一的大文豪，尤以詩名蜚聲世界文壇。他於一八六一年四月十四日生於印度加爾各答城，是達旺侃納可·泰戈爾王子之孫。幼年在本地受私人教育。於一八七七年赴英攻法律，但不久仍回返印度。年青時代，很早就爲「孟加拉雜誌」寫稿，文句漸盛。　　一九〇一年他開始在波爾普耳地方（距加爾各答九三哩）創立一座學校，這就是那著名的香滴尼開登學院。在這學院中所旅行的教育制度，一反成規，經過泰氏數十年慘淡的經營，現在已成爲一座國際性的大學了。　　一九一三年泰氏獲得諾貝爾文學獎金，在東方文壇上放一異彩。他却把這筆八千金鎊的獎金捐贈給他的學校，作爲擴充的費用。他曾數度去歐洲遊歷，也曾到過中國·日本·及美國。　　一九一五年他曾接受爵士位，但於一九一九年他放棄了爵士位，以抗議鎮壓潘傑勃地方騷動的政策。他對於政治的興趣，僅止於關心印度更深遠的生命。他以爲民族運動應在爭取政治自由之前，先謀社會的改革。在他豐富的作品中，充滿着對於宇宙美感的意識，對兒童與簡潔的愛戀，以及對上帝的自覺。　　泰戈爾今年八十歲了。這位八十高齡的老文豪，非但仍在文學上努力不懈，而且更不斷地用文字將孟加拉人民真切的反感，傳達給西方人士？無疑的，以今日印度民族自身的處境，泰戈爾對被壓迫者的痛苦，自能更爲深切地體會到。所以他對這次中國非常的遭際，曾正式表示同情。這位白髪老詩人的正義呼聲，較之着眼於人道與道德的觀點，用道憐憫目光的紳士們所喊出的「同情」高調，當然會更加深切與更有意義的。太戈爾像  徐悲鴻作泰戈爾與徐悲鴻  張沅潔　　四月十四日（明日）是印度詩翁泰戈爾八秩誕辰，不但全印民眾將隆重地爲這詩翁祝嘏，在中國，目前正在苦難中掙扎的東方弟兄之邦的中國國民，也無不爲欽仰這位偉大的文化先驅者而將馨香祝禱詩翁的福體日益康强。泰氏在這次中日戰爭之初，即和日本作家山本實彥筆戰。他的正義感實足以繼承真正東方精神的偉大的靈魂。　　泰氏是現任印度國際大學院秘書長，去冬囑該院譚雲山教授轉請中國名畫家徐悲鴻應邀前往，極受歡迎。詩翁曾在Santiniketan私邸壽齊中，舉行盛大之歡迎會，會後與徐教授同攝一影（附圖）。徐教授曾爲詩翁速寫十數張，其中最神似的一張亦附刊於此。詩翁超人的智慧與强烈的正義感，在徐教授簡潔的幾筆中完全表現無遺了。　　（徐教授刻於三月初由印度起程赴喜馬拉雅山作畫）。徐悲鴻與太戈爾雜感死而不死  新虛　　人是可以「死而不死」的，怎樣是死而不死呢？譬任一棵樹老了，園藝家用接木的方法，去延長他的壽命，難道將來人類不能用科學的力量，照接木的方法延長他的壽命麼？接枝後的枯樹，他生命果然繼續了，但是根本變成前後兩種，所以對於續命的人類，只能說他「死而不死」。　　過去，英國愛丁堡大學化學主任懇達爾博士對於「長生不老」一問題，作種種的研究和實驗，曾得到這樣的結果：喝重水，可以延長壽命。他說：服用重水的人，比較服用常水的人，或許能以一半的速度營其生活現象，這對於年青的男女，固然不宜勸用，但對年過六十，要安樂過其餘年的人，却是延長壽命唯一的秘訣」。　　但是這種科學家的口述和試驗，我們僅能在報紙上閱到，至其效果究竟怎樣？我們還是不能洞悉一二，自己來實驗吧！重水一克的價值是一元多美金，真貴得駭人！這樣的實驗當然是不能辦到的。所以科學的「死而不死」法，能否實現，我們還是不得而知。　　我們的黃任之先生，他在早年確已發明一個「死而不死」的方法，也是人人可以辦到的。他老先生以爲壽命是有盡的，事業是無盡的，我人身體可死，但是我的精神却可使之永存。譬如提倡職業教育，我一人去幹，一旦身死，事業亦爲人死而亡，那是真的死了。但是，我有許多同志，大家來幹，假定一百個同志中，我一人死了，還有九十九個人在後幹，前面的人死，後面的人來，人儘管死，事業卻永遠活動而生存。這豈不是「死而不死」嗎？　　然而現在有一部分孤島人士，既不能「安分守己」，「終其天年」；反而做種種「醉生夢死」的事情。這種人真是「雖生猶死」，和「死而不死」的人，比較起來，確是有天壤之別了。餓的意義  吳　作「餓，到底是甚麼一回事？」　　「去問先生，他一定知道的。」軍備英軍的口糧  陸德綱　　每個在前綫作戰的英兵，每天可領到麵包十六盎斯，烤肉十四盎斯，蔬菜三盎斯，洋山芋十二盎斯，豬油三盎斯，茶一盎斯，和罐頭水菓一聽。罐頭水菓的種類，計分李子，桃子，櫻桃，菠蘿蜜，蘋果，杏子，生梨，棗子，覆盆果八種，可任選一種。若士兵不愛吃罐頭果品，那麼可揀橘子，生梨等鮮菓吃。另外每兵士每星期尙能領得烟草兩盎斯，自來火兩盒，可可或咖啡一竔半，和香水一小瓶，（打仗不忘漂亮。）　　去年耶誕節時英屬南菲，曾送香煙二百萬枝給防守馬奇諾陣綫的英法兵士。此後南菲當局尤每月送英軍香烟一百萬枝，所以每兵士平均在每星期中，可領得香烟五十枝之多。若嫌不夠，還可向隨軍商店隨時購買，價格非常便宜。</p>

<p>㳺藝界李時敏談　黃宗沾的攝影技巧  一和　　好萊塢中國顧問李時敏氏，上月間由好萊塢返滬，下榻於國際飯店，記者往訪，承吿以好萊塢中國藝人之近况，其中晨爲稱讚者，爲攝影師黄宗沾氏。他說：　　「黄宗沾曾經在幾次攝影競選中，名列前茅。全世界薪金最高的五位排影技師中，黄氏亦爲其中之一。看過他的攝影的人，沒有一個不佩服的，他有他特具的作風和獨到之處。　於此道的硏究深邃，逈非尋常人能及其萬一。」　　「他要攝溫柔艷情的鏡頭時，就用極柔和的光綫，和輕淡的暗影。因此在銀幕上所現出的，全是一種動盪的，不可捉摸的某種神秘氛圍，使得千萬的觀衆，感到一種春天的酥麻的情緒。　　「遇着緊張陰險的塲面，他藉着燈光的配置，角度的上下，和綫條的變動，使得所攝下的畫面，換了一副恐怖，動人，緊張的調子。　　「黄氏的攝影技巧，可說是到了藝術的最高峰。黄昏時候的落日，天靑如洗的月夜，寂靜的充滿着詩意的鄕村街道，天眞爛漫的孩童的而型……這種種，在他的萬能的鏡頭之下拍攝出來，不僅於射着平面的感覺，並且還帶着立體的緊抓住人靈感的魔力。這是黄宗沾氏獨有的特長。」（關於黄氏之略歷，請參閱上月十二日本欄。）「梅蘿香」與「中旅」  唐槐秋　　「梅蘿香」是美國作家Engene　Walter　一九〇八年的作品，算計起來，到現在已經有三十二年了。　　「中國旅行劇團」是成立於民國二十二年，到現在已經七年了。「中旅一成立後所演的第一個戲就是「梅蘿　」。在七年前，「中旅」上演此劇，也就有人說它米免太舊，可是當時，我也經過一番考慮，以當時的中國社會情形來說，前進的，記音樂家沈雅琴小姐  芳　　　本月十七日蘭心大戲院舉行的昔樂會，沈雅琴Mary　Shen小姐，亦將一顯身手，這位沈小姐的藝術，在歐洲早已名震遐邇，爲祖國增了不少光榮。我和她並不認識，產過我也是一個嗜好音樂的人，在好久以前，就知道她是工部局樂師百器先生的高足，因了她的天才卓越，受到政府賞識，派往比國深造，在比法多年，獲得比國國　皇家音樂院特等第一獎狀，備受海外人士的讚賞。這次回國以後，還祇是第一次在公衆前表演，我希望嗜好音樂的同志，別失去了這難能可貴的機會。　　雖然是迅速而遙遠地前進着，然而就普通一般地來說，類似「梅蘿　」劇中所描寫的一切，實在覺得它不僅不太落後，而且可以說是相常地適合，所以結果就決意用了這個劇本。　　「中旅」初次演出「梅蘿　」於南京，頗得好評，繼之巡行公演於黄河兩岸，長江上下游，在縱的方面，經六七年之久，在橫的方面，有數十餘城市之多，未嘗稍衰，這也就說明了此劇確有其永久性的緣故。　　戰事以來，一切都自然地有着極大的變遷，包括地說，一切都應該積極地指示一條出路。「梅蘿香」旣爲「中旅」建團的第一個戲，我們是始終紀念着它的，故最近再商之於是劇之改編者顧仲彝氏，尤將內容略加修改後，遂於此次重行排演，至於演出之成績如何，則惟有留待許多親愛的觀衆來賜敎與批評了。華光劇校公演  克楨　　華光戲劇專科學校，在上海可算是一個硏究戲劇的敢高學府了，它裏面的敎授都是由富於戲劇硏究的份子來担任的，如周貽白，魯思，戈戈，陳明勳，何劍飛，陳歌辛，黄魯等等，而同學們亦全是前進的靑年，他們沒有一天不在融洽中對劇藝上作更進一步的硏討，並且還抱着百折不撓的精神，在這萬惡社會的孤島上，不絕地負起劇運上重大的使命。今天（十三）他們將有一次籌募創建基金的演出，劇目有一個獨幕，第一個是戈戈導演的「僞婚」，第二個是何劍飛導演的「米」，第三個是黄魯導演的「享樂的人們」，此間惡劣的環境眞的釗了極點了，他們演這三個小戲，正對着現社會打下的三支針，把孤島上一批頭腦昏聵的人們淸理一下，而來一次暴露的演出，演員的優秀，自在意中，他們是從一百多個演員中，選出來的十餘個，其演出成績，當可使人滿意的。　　「梁山伯祝英台」主角張翠紅顧也魯下圖為韓蘭根的表情棋苑  連學正編　陸承鑄校　　對局　第四十五局　黑先　　　　朱劍秒先　謝俠遜　　炮二平五　馬八進七　馬二進三　馬一進二　車一平二　　車九平八　兵五進一　士四進五　車二進六　炮八平九　　炮九平七　車三平四　車八平五　馬七進五　車五平八　　車九進一　相三進五　車九平六　車一平四　車六進八　　帥五平四　車四退二　帥四平五　車四平六　馬七進六　　車六進一　馬六進七　車六平二　馬七退八　馬五進六　　炮七進一　兵七進一　卒三進一　兵七進一　馬三進四　　兵七平六　炮三進七　士四進五　炮二進四　馬三進五　　炮二平九　士五進四　馬八進六　兵六進一　卒五進一　　馬五進七　馬六進四　炮五平六　卒五進一　炮八平九　　炮九進三　將五進一　炮七退六　將五進一　卒五平四　　（黑馬死紅勝）</p>

<h3>Unable to Invade Chinese Army, Japanese Army May Shorten Front, Chinese Armies Preparing for Large-Scale Counter-Offensive</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Well-informed Chinese sources here, based on front-line news from North China, Central China, and South China, assert that in the near future, the Japanese army in any part of China will not launch a large-scale offensive. It is reported that the Japanese army on all fronts has indicated a shortening of the戰钱 (zhàn qián, war front), especially in Suiyuan, southern Jiangxi, central Hubei, and the areas near Nanchang. The news of the Japanese army withdrawing on all fronts leads one to believe that the Japanese commander-in-chief may temporarily adopt a defensive strategy in the war against China. Japan seems likely to concentrate its efforts on political and economic offensives in the near future. Now that the Nanjing "new regime" has been established, it is said that the Japanese are gradually hoping to defeat China by political means. At the same time, Japan is also attempting to develop the economic resources, trade, and industry in the occupied areas to consolidate what it has gained. If the above observations are correct, there will probably be no large-scale Japanese offensive in any part of China in the short term. Therefore, people are speculating about what policy China will adopt to cope with this new Japanese strategy. China hopes to lure the Japanese army deep inland and further hopes to消耗 (xiāohào, deplete) the Japanese army in the mountains of western China through mobile warfare. If the Japanese army no longer goes deeper, the question arises as to whether the Chinese army will take the offensive or continue to adopt a defensive stance and prolong the stalemate. Although China's supreme commander has not yet announced the Chinese plan, the Chinese armies on all fronts may have the possibility of launching a large-scale counter-offensive in the near future. It is heard that this attack is already being prepared in some areas. After the Japanese army in Suiyuan, southern Jiangxi, and the areas near Nanchang began to shorten their defense lines and redistribute their troops, the Chinese army launched a fierce attack. Well-informed Chinese sources here believe that the opportunity for a general Chinese counter-offensive has not yet arrived, and it does not seem likely that all efforts will be made to recover major cities such as Hangzhou, Nanning, and Nanjing. However, the Chinese army's attacks will continue to be maintained, and if they can be occupied without paying too great a price, they will still be攻取 (gōngqǔ, attacked and captured).

<h3>The Future of the US Dollar</h3>
<p>In the past week, there have been dramatic changes in the European war. Germany seized Denmark and attacked Norway, causing an uproar around the world and making people feel惶惑 (huánghuò, perplexed). The exchange rate between British and US currencies has frequently shrunk due to the tense world situation, which has especially encouraged people in Shanghai to accumulate US dollars and increased their interest. With the需求 (xūqiú, demand) being strong, the price naturally rose. But it is not only China that is like this. Since gold from various countries regards the United States as the only safe haven, and US dollars are the most reliable currency in the world, it is fitting that there is a觀 (guān, view) of獨造 (dúzào, originality). Although the United States possesses a huge amount of gold, regardless of whether part of it is deposited by European countries, it is the United States' business to take good care of it. Now that US dollars are as expensive as they are, this is something that the United States can be proud of, but the possible difficulties that are accumulating are something that the world cannot ignore.</p>
<p>The reason why the US dollar is expensive is precisely because the demand for US dollars is huge. The reason why the demand for US dollars is huge is that, first, since the outbreak of the European war, European countries have been demanding more arms and equipment from the United States, which means that more US dollars need to be spent. Secondly, as the scope of global unrest expands, more and more funds from various places seek to escape to the United States. Whenever there is a storage, it is in US dollars, and whenever there is a use, it is in US dollars. US dollars have almost become the world's standard currency, so how can the market not be firm and expensive. As a物 (wù, commodity), currency should not be too expensive or too cheap. Too expensive will hinder the outflow of products, and too cheap will increase the difficulties of general internal life. Although the currencies of various countries 各自为政 (gèzì wèizhèng, each governs its own affairs) and strive to strengthen controls, they are quite able to maintain their nominal levels. In fact, there are those that cannot be maintained and can only allow them to rise and fall naturally, resulting in uneven market conditions. For example, the exchange rate between the US dollar and the British pound is still four yuan and change in London, but only three yuan and four jiao in New York. The exchange rate between the British pound and the US dollar in London is a nominal price, and the exchange rate between the British pound and the US dollar in New York is a real price. In today's Britain, it is by no means a lack of ability to maintain the 名實齐一 (míngshí qiyi, uniformity between name and reality) of the pound's price, but because it is wartime, this is not what it is focusing on.</p>
<p>It is indeed expensive to use US dollars. This is because the credit of the US dollar is strong, which is gratifying. But 美金貴 (měijīn guì, expensive US dollars) means that the US goods purchased by various countries are also expensive. If US goods are expensive, those who use them will change to using goods that are cheaper than US goods because of their high cost, or even制 (jié, restricting) and not use them. If the United States wants to maintain its normal foreign trade, it must either lower prices or lower the currency value to cope. But both of these have their difficulties. Lowering prices will inevitably cause unrest in domestic industry and commerce. Moreover, the United States' measures for industry, commerce, and finance in recent years have been aimed at promoting the external development of industry and commerce and maintaining the stability of international exchange rates. Although the advent of world events does not allow this to continue, the United States still remains a砥柱 (dǐzhù, pillar) in the狂瀾 (kuánglán, turbulent waves), and there is a reason not to lightly change things. Moreover, the various接濟 (jiējì, aid) needed by various countries in wartime are exactly what the United States is seeking. Regardless of whether the US dollar縮 (suō, shrinks) or US goods are貴 (guì, expensive), if the required products cannot be obtained from the United States, they can only be sought from the United States even if they are貴 (guì, expensive). Moreover, it is not only during wartime. After the war ends, there will still be many material resources that need the help of the United States. Therefore, the gold of millions of US dollars stored by various countries in the United States may gradually transfer to become the property of the United States. For example, Japan originally had存金 (cúnjīn, gold deposits) in the United States, but as a result of China's sustained resistance, the Japanese尽耗 (jìnhào, exhausted) their deposits. Because US goods are sold to Japan in an endless stream, which means that Japanese gold偿美 (cháng měi, is paying the US), gradually coming to an end. The same is true for European countries against the United States. However, on the other hand, if the US dollar is firmly昂 (áng, expensive) and does not松 (sōng, loosen) a little, and the amount of gold held by various countries is also decreasing, then the United States' normal foreign exports will inevitably encounter a huge打擊 (dǎjī, blow). For example, recently the British orders for the wool industry in Shanghai have temporarily become very active, while the orders for Italy have become淡 (dàn, sluggish). This is because British gold is平 (píng, flat) and US dollars are紧 (jǐn, tight). It is cheaper to use British gold to place orders than to use US dollars, and Italian goods must be settled in US dollars. So they changed to using British currency to place orders. Even this one point is not enough to槪其餘 (gài qí yú, generalize about the rest). However, like China's foreign trade, which ranked first with the United States before the war, has greatly fallen after the war. There are many reasons for this, and the暴縮 (bàosuō, sharp shrinkage) of the US exchange rate and the 本重 (běnzhòng, high cost) of US goods are one of the important reasons. The貴 (guì, expensiveness) of US dollars is not limited to a corner of China, but is the same in other countries. Then, US industry and commerce, except for the military industry, will eventually feel a沉闷 (chénmèn, depressing) situation one day, and seeking a way to打通开塞 (dǎtōng kāisè, open up the obstruction) will necessarily lower one of the物价 (wùjià, commodity price) and the currency price to make some adjustments. In addition, the only way is to invest abroad to疏散 (shūsàn, disperse) its雄厚 (xiónghòu, strong) funds. Now, I do not know how the United States plans to do it, but it is possible to use several methods at the same time and deal with it carefully. Not only is it possible, but it is also necessary for the United States. Therefore, those who are now沉溺于美滙 (chénnì yú měi huì, addicted to US currency) should also know where to stop.</p>

<h3>General Lu Can Leads Norwegian Army in Resistance, Defense Line Parallels Swedish Border, Report Norwegian Army Recaptures Transit City Hamar</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden - The Norwegian government has just appointed General Lu, the country's infantry inspector general, as commander-in-chief of the army to lead the troops in resisting aggression. (Havas dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden - The Norwegian government issued a public statement in Elverum last night stating that national mobilization is proceeding in an orderly manner. Authorities are focusing on defense as soldiers gather. German forces are attempting to advance on Elverum but have been repelled near Eidsvoll. The Norwegian General Staff has deployed defenses throughout the western provinces. Defenses in the Bergen area are in place, and there is reason to believe German forces there have been contained. The situation is similar in the Trondelag area. The fortress at Bolærne in the Oslofjord was still resisting yesterday morning. The German forces advancing on Elverum are under the command of the former German air force attaché stationed in Oslo, with the apparent intention of capturing the Norwegian government and members of parliament. Although defenses in the Elverum area are not yet fully in place, Norwegian troops have hastily assembled there, aided by military engineers and members of rifle clubs and training officers. When the German forces attacked, this hastily formed army engaged them for half an hour, eventually driving them back, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy while suffering only two Norwegian casualties. The Norwegian army's combat performance in this engagement is commendable. Another public statement said that the Norwegian government has organized administrative affairs in the new capital. Officials in various regions should await instructions. Mobilization continues according to plan. The Oslo radio station has fallen into German hands, and the cancellation of mobilization orders it announced is a German fabrication. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden - Local evening newspapers are reporting that Norwegian authorities have established a very long defense line within the country, running parallel to the Swedish border. The army has requisitioned all private transportation for military use. A unit of the Norwegian army is attempting to dislodge German forces occupying the city of Stavanger, to prevent the forward units of German forces fighting near the Swedish border from linking up with the main German forces stationed in Trondheim. Furthermore, all indications suggest that the Quisling-led Norwegian puppet government was prepared well before the German invasion and had planted supporters in key ports, especially Narvik. (Havas dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden - According to news broadcast by a local radio station, the Norwegian army has recaptured the transit city of Hamar and pushed the German forces back to a point 50 kilometers south of the city. As of last night, the outer defense line between Oslo and Boholmarna was still in Norwegian hands. Furthermore, Norwegian authorities claim that the railway line from Trondheim to the Swedish border has been occupied by German forces. They also deny that British troops have landed at Narvik. (Havas dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden - According to reports in local newspapers, Trondheim, located 100 kilometers from the Swedish border, is under German control. German forces have advanced from Trondheim in two directions, north and south. The situation in Narvik remains unchanged, with the Germans controlling the city and harbor. It is unknown whether Tromsø, located 150 kilometers north of Narvik, has been occupied by German forces or is still in Norwegian hands. (Haitong dispatch, 12th)</p>
<h3>German War Report</h3>
<p>Berlin - The German High Command has announced that Denmark is calm and peaceful. The German air force on the west coast of Denmark has not encountered any enemy aircraft. In Norway, German forces in Narvik continue to advance and have occupied Evignes without any fighting. British aircraft attacked Trondheim but were repelled. A British light warship attempted to enter Trondheim Bay but was unsuccessful. Bergen, Stavanger, and Kristiansand Bay are all calm and peaceful. British aircraft attacked Stavanger, and one was shot down by anti-aircraft artillery. German forces near Oslo are also advancing in all directions. The German navy continued operations yesterday and sank two British cruisers near Narvik. (Haitong dispatch, 12th)</p>

<h3>Reports of Unusual German Activity, Major War About to Break Out on Western Front, Netherlands Takes Defensive Measures, Belgium Completes Mobilization</h3>
<p>Paris - Authoritative sources stated yesterday that the French high command believes Germany is preparing to attack the Western Front. French army analysts say that a major war is about to break out on the Western Front. Germany is making obvious preparations at several points on the front line. News from the Netherlands says that Dutch authorities, as a precautionary measure, have evacuated Dutch villagers living near the German border. (United Press dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>London - Belief that Germany is about to launch a major offensive on the Western Front has increased here last night. Many believe that the Netherlands or Belgium is on Hitler's action timetable. Not only amateur strategists but also most experts believe that Germany's adventure in Scandinavia, in addition to its direct objectives, is using a feint to divert Allied attention to the Scandinavian countries so that Germany can invade the Netherlands and Belgium using blitzkrieg tactics. An experienced Dutch commentator expressed serious doubts about the Netherlands' ability to resist Germany fiercely. However, it is generally believed that Belgium will fiercely resist any German invasion. (United Press dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>Amsterdam - The Netherlands has stepped up defensive measures against a possible German blitzkrieg. Yesterday, women and children working for the Philips Radio Tube Company in Eindhoven were evacuated. The area is located on the Dutch-German border north of Blerick. Military sources say this is a precautionary measure and ask residents to remain calm. (United Press dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>Amsterdam - It is reported that German troops outside the Dutch border have received extra ammunition. Military precautions continue in the Netherlands today, and troops are being deployed.

<p>"Daily Telegraph" Paris dispatch - Paris has received news of new German threats to the Netherlands and Belgium. Many believe that the fate of Denmark and Norway has caused the Netherlands and Belgium to consider whether they can wait for a definite German offensive before requesting assistance from the Allies. It is generally believed that the German government has informed the Dutch and Belgian representatives in Germany that any attempt by the Netherlands and Belgium to place themselves under the protection of Britain and France will prompt a swift German attack. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>Brussels - The Belgian government yesterday announced that the mobilization of the Belgian army had been completed. Before the German invasion of Scandinavia, the Belgian government had conducted various secret examinations of the Belgian-German border defense line. After the outbreak of the German-Scandinavian war, the Belgian government immediately dispatched several high-ranking military officers to the border to inspect defense conditions, so that they could clearly understand that Belgium must be able to stay out of the current European war. The Belgian government has already taken various military measures, and its neighboring countries are able to respect Belgium's neutral status. Since the outbreak of the European war eight months ago, the Belgian army has already completed mobilization, and various defensive works have also been completed in sequence. If an aggressor wishes to take action against Belgium, it will definitely not be able to drive straight in. The Belgian government will make this clear. (Havas dispatch, 11th)</p>

<h3>Britain Lays Mines in the North Sea Area</h3>
<p>London - The Admiralty announces that certain areas of the North Sea, the Skagerrak, and the Kattegat have been mined and are therefore dangerous areas. They border the coasts of Denmark and Germany, as well as the territorial waters of Sweden and the Netherlands. It also states that no mines have been laid in a channel ten miles wide on either side of certain points. The westernmost limit of the minefield extends 420 miles north from Fyvom near Schiermonnikoog off the Dutch coast to a point 60 miles southwest of Bergen. It then extends east, encompassing the entire North Sea, reaching the Danish coast. The Skagerrak is also within it. In view of the comments made by Germany after the Allies laid mines in Norwegian territorial waters and subsequent events, this minefield does not extend into Swedish or Dutch territorial waters at any point, to avoid giving Germany an excuse. It also leaves a channel two miles wide in the center of the minefield, so that neutral ships can safely sail from the Swedish coast into the unmined part of the North Sea. The new minefield in the Skagerrak and the Kattegat has cut off Germany's access to the North Sea via the Skagerrak. German ships that now cross the Skagerrak directly to the Oslofjord or to the fortresses occupied by German forces in southwestern Norway will be at risk. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)</p>

<h3>A Fierce Battle in the North Sea, German Fleet "Crippled," Nearly One-Tenth of Its Entire Force Lost, Churchill Reports British Naval Victories</h3>
<p>London - British First Lord of the Admiralty Churchill reported to the House of Commons yesterday on naval battles, saying, "I must acknowledge that the German navy is now crippled in important respects. I believe that the German navy's actions, which have been adventurous but have come at a heavy price, are only a prelude to the larger events that will occur on land. However, we are prepared to resist the enemy's greatest threats and will devote our lives and strength to achieving the victory that the world needs. The German navy has now suffered very heavy losses. The Norwegian artillery has played a role in inflicting damage on the enemy. I believe that Hitler has expanded the war to the north, forcing the people of the Scandinavian Peninsula to change their neutral attitude. Since Sunday, four German cruisers, accounting for half of their pre-war strength, have now been sunk, and many destroyers and submarines have also been lost." (Reuters dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>London - A Reuters naval correspondent says that the losses on both sides in this week's naval battles cannot be accurately compared at this time, but rough estimates can confirm the accuracy of Churchill's statement that "the German fleet is now crippled in key areas." According to available information, before the war, the Germans had eight cruisers and thirty destroyers. Now, four cruisers have been lost, and three destroyers are known to have been lost. Another two or three may have sunk. In addition, several submarines and more than ten supply ships have been lost. German ships damaged include one battleship, one cruiser, and several destroyers. According to current estimates, Britain had 160 destroyers before the war. Four have been lost, and two destroyers and one battlecruiser have been damaged. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)</p>
<h3>Churchill’s Speech Full Text (Continued and Completed)</h3>
<p>During last night’s dusk attack, the enemy used sixty aircraft in a continuous wave-like assault. We suffered no losses, while at least six enemy aircraft were shot down (cheers). This achievement is due to the effectiveness of our artillery and the appropriate combined efforts of our air force. The safe anchorage of our fleet in Scapa Flow is of utmost importance. The repeated attacks by German aircraft have provided our artillery units with opportunities to practice their anti-aircraft gunnery. We have never had such moving targets before (cheers and laughter).</p>
<p>Now, let me talk about matters beyond Scapa Flow. When undertaking risky actions, we naturally prepare for unexpected losses. Our aircraft have been conducting reconnaissance over the entire North Sea. On Sunday night, it was reported that a German battlecruiser and several other cruisers and destroyers were speeding north. Upon receiving the report, our fleet in Scapa Flow immediately prepared for action, and the Commander-in-Chief personally led the ships out to sea. Simultaneously, another strong British naval force sped toward Narvik to lay a minefield off the Norwegian coast, aiming to achieve the purpose I mentioned earlier. At dawn on Sunday, the mine laying was completed according to plan. The mine-laying ships then withdrew to avoid any potential conflict with Norwegian warships maintaining Norway's neutrality. When the destroyer HMS “Glowworm” was heading north to join the fleet on Sunday afternoon, it sighted the first enemy destroyer at 8:00 AM on Monday, followed by two more, and engaged in battle.</p>
<p>The ship then reported that an unknown number of enemy ships were active in the north. Reports of these incidents arrived every few minutes, but the final report was abruptly cut off. We believe that the ship engaged a superior enemy fleet and must have been sunk in the battle. This encounter indicated that a significant number of enemy naval vessels had entered the sea and that many events were already underway. Since then, the battle has continued day and night without stopping and is still ongoing. Currently, we have not secured any ports along the Norwegian coast, so the full extent of the situation is not yet known. There are many reports in the news, but they are all rumors from neutral sources, and the truth will be known later.</p>
<p>Churchill continued, "Now, I will try to summarize the main events for you. On Monday morning, the enemy fleet, which sank the British ship HMS “Glowworm” and included a German battlecruiser and other important warships, appeared to be surrounded by the northern British fleet and the main British domestic fleet. Both of these British fleets were stronger than the enemy fleet. However, the enemy fleet escaped. Looking at the map with flags indicating positions, you might think there would be a certain outcome, but when you are at sea, there is only water and sky, an endless expanse, surging waves, thick fog, and the darkness of night, making it difficult to track the enemy ships. At such times, you cannot expect to be able to measure the advances and retreats of the army as you would on land."</p>
<p>On Tuesday, while patrolling south of Bergen, the British fleet was under constant attack by German aircraft. German radio regularly broadcasted news of the sinking or severe damage to several British battleships and cruisers, but in reality, only two cruisers suffered minor damage that did not hinder their operation. These two ships are still with the fleet. The British flagship HMS "Rodney" was hit by a large bomb, but the ship's deck armor was very strong, and despite the explosion, the ship was not damaged, with only four crew members and three sailors injured. Considering the structure of British warships, this is considered very satisfactory (cheers). The British cruiser HMS "Aurora" was attacked five times by bombers, but all failed. However, the destroyer HMS "Gurkha" was directly hit, causing the ship to list and sink after four and a half hours. Almost all of the crew were rescued. On Tuesday afternoon, the British destroyer HMS "Zulu" sank a German submarine off the Orkney Islands. On Tuesday morning, the British battlecruiser HMS "Renown" sighted the German battlecruiser "Scharnhorst" and a 10,000-ton cruiser off Narvik. At that time, the seas were treacherous, and in the high winds, HMS "Renown" opened fire at a range of 18,000 yards. After three minutes, the enemy ships returned fire and then sped away. HMS "Renown," after nine minutes of shelling, saw that the front of "Scharnhorst" had been hit and no longer returned fire, with only the rear beginning to return fire. The German ship was very fast, and HMS "Renown" moved forward at a speed of 24 knots. After another two minutes, a plume of thick smoke rose from the German ship, indicating it had been hit by a second shell. At this time, the 10,000-ton German cruiser laid a smokescreen behind "Scharnhorst," and the two German ships fled at full speed.</p>
<p>Churchill continued, "British submarines have sunk a large number of German transport ships and supply ships. All German ships in the Skagerrak and Kattegat will be sunk. By evening, when the opportunity arises, all enemy ships will be sunk. We will not allow the enemy to pass through these waters without difficulty to supply their army. To date, more than ten enemy ships, some of which are large, have been sunk or captured in the Kattegat or other parts of the North Sea while attempting to transport supplies to troops landing in Narvik."</p>
<p>Based on the information we obtained from the Naval Department late Tuesday, we believed that the military operation was quite dangerous. Therefore, at 1:00 AM, we notified the commander of a destroyer flotilla, instructing him to use his own judgment on whether to attack. We will support all of his actions, regardless of what happens (cheers). The commander then led five destroyers forward and attacked enemy destroyers and shore batteries. His initial report only mentioned our losses, which I will announce immediately, because I believe we should not hide such events. Since we are at war, we are always prepared to accept setbacks. After receiving the report at around 1:00 AM, I immediately sent it to the Prime Minister, who immediately announced it to the House of Commons, the country, and the press. After receiving any news, whether good or bad, we will send it to Parliament, the Prime Minister, and the newspapers.</p>
<p>We later received a report that our destroyers, while returning, encountered the enemy ship "Rauenfels," loaded with reserve munitions. I believe the enemy intended to use these munitions to turn Narvik into a strong fortress, like Sevastopol or Gibraltar. That ship was sunk. We must admit that this will reduce our current workload.</p>
<p>The British Air Force has been constantly flying reconnaissance, bombing, and protecting the Navy. I would like to express my gratitude on behalf of my naval colleagues. Yesterday, this Air Force sent two groups of twelve aircraft each to attack the two German cruisers in Bergen Harbor, which were protecting the troops landing there. One bomb immediately disappeared. Yesterday evening, British Naval Air Arm aircraft also flew from their base in the Orkneys to Bergen to attack another German cruiser that had not been sunk, dropping three 500-pound bombs on it. Fifteen of the sixteen British aircraft returned. Later, aircraft were dispatched for reconnaissance. It was reported that the ship was no longer at its original mooring, and there was only an oil slick about a mile long on the surface of the harbor. At dawn today, eighteen Naval Air Arm aircraft, each carrying torpedoes, attacked enemy ships in Trondheim. We had hoped to sink a Hipper-class German cruiser that was moored there, but that ship had sailed the previous night, so the result was only the sinking of one enemy destroyer."</p>
<p>Mr. Churchill added that the Faroe Islands are a very important military base. The residents of the islands have expressed a warm welcome to the British army. I hope to give a further report to Parliament in a few days.</p>
<p>Labour MP Alexander then spoke, warning people to be wary of rumors. He said he would prefer to hear delayed but accurate news. He also said that we should explain to the neutral countries in the dangerous areas the remarks made by certain quarters in Turkey this morning, which said that this week’s events further prove that they only have two paths to follow: to resolutely accept German control or to fight alongside the Allied countries.</p>
<p>Liberal leader Sinclair also spoke, saying that Churchill’s remarks were serious and appropriate, and that these two qualities were deeply gratifying. Today, we can rejoice that the German aggressors have been severely punished by the British Navy. It is not only the British who rejoice. Norway’s defense is admirable, and the British government should provide effective assistance in a timely manner. He does not believe that the people understand how important the current work is. Minimizing the impact of Germany’s recent steps is not beneficial to the people and is detrimental to the cause of joint operations. He would like to say one more thing: do not make optimistic predictions to the people, but firmly grasp reality and tell them the truth. Although things are difficult, they are sufficient to strengthen the people’s determination to persevere to the end. We cannot rule out the possibility that Germany’s attack on Norway is a feint. Once our attention is diverted, Germany may strike elsewhere. (Reuters, 11th)</p>

<h3>British and French Naval Power Absolutely Superior; Polish Ships Join the Battle; French Prime Minister Reports on the War Situation</h3>
<p>Paris: French Prime Minister Reynaud announced in the Chamber of Deputies that as a result of the historical naval battle off the coast of Norway yesterday, it is said that 22 ships sank to the bottom of the sea, including 18 German ships and 4 British ships. None were French. Germany’s initial tactical victory has proven to be a major strategic error. Germany’s iron ore transport line has been cut off and will remain impassable from now on. The British Navy lost 4 destroyers, and the German Navy lost 4 cruisers, accounting for one-tenth of its entire cruiser fleet, and lost 1 destroyer and 12 troop carriers. Germany needs steel to attack us, but now it is acting like a besieged army breaking out. Germany ravaged Denmark and then hastily invaded Norway, thinking it would not encounter more resistance than it did in Austria in 1938, but it did not expect the Norwegians to resist like the Belgians in 1914. The entire chamber stood up and cheered as the Prime Minister said this. Reynaud also described the naval situation in the war, saying that there is no precedent in history for a navy that is certainly at a disadvantage to fight without losing. The French fleet and Polish warships have joined the British ships in battle. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<h3>Germany’s Invasion of Northern Europe a Major Mistake</h3>
<p>Washington: British Naval Minister Churchill's clear announcement yesterday of British losses has created a very good impression here. The general public infers from Churchill’s account of the Scandinavian naval battle that the development of the war is favorable to the Allied countries, and that Hitler's invasion of Norway is a major strategic error. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>Berlin: According to sources here, the British naval losses acknowledged by British Defence Committee Chairman Churchill in the House of Commons yesterday were mostly previous losses. For example, the HMS "Rodney" was said by Churchill to have been damaged yesterday, but in fact, it was damaged by a German air raid on the British naval base at Scapa Flow on March 16. (Haitong Telegraph, 12th)</p>
<h3>British Navy Detains Danish Ships in China</h3>
<p>Hong Kong: It is said here today that the British Navy stationed in Hong Kong is now preparing to seize 40 to 50 Norwegian and Danish ships off the Chinese coast. Eleven Norwegian and Danish ships have been detained and were placed under police supervision yesterday. The goods on Danish ships are confiscated as enemy property. (United Press, 12th)</p>
<h3>Britain Resolves Not to Allow Germany to Gain a Foothold in Iceland; The Safety of Danish Greenland Becomes a Question</h3>
<p>London: Naval Minister Churchill announced in the House of Commons yesterday that British troops have occupied the Faroe Islands, but have not retaken Norwegian ports. Iceland is still under consideration. Once Denmark is liberated, the Faroe Islands will be returned to their original owners. British troops should take what they want on the Norwegian coast to enhance their blockade effectiveness and will not allow the Germans to gain a foothold in Iceland. From a strategic and military point of view, we have a great advantage in Scandinavia and the northern European seas. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>London: Foreign affairs figures here have declared that the situation caused by Iceland’s separation from Denmark is being closely watched by the British and French governments, and that they will discuss the protection issue with the Icelandic government. The United States will also participate at that time because its interests are affected. As for the Faroe Islands, which belong to Denmark, they have been occupied by British troops. There is no difficulty in finding a legal explanation for this move, but Iceland is an independent country, and the situation is different. Therefore, Britain has no intention of occupying it. In addition, Danish Greenland is not likely to be threatened in the short term. If Germany invades it, Britain and France will immediately deal with it from Canada. (Havas, 12th)</p>
<p>Ottawa: Prime Minister Mackenzie King recently told the press that after German troops invaded Denmark and Norway, the Canadian federal government is exchanging views with the British government and will consult with the US government to determine policies on Danish Greenland and Iceland. He also said that he would travel to the United States for a weekend vacation in Virginia and spend a day or two in Washington to visit President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull in the name of "friendship" and take the opportunity to talk with British Ambassador Lord Lothian. (Havas, 12th)</p>
<p>Washington: After Germany's invasion of Denmark and Norway, the status of Danish Greenland has become an issue. Some members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee advocate that the US government should extend the Monroe Doctrine to the island. California Democratic Congressman Isaac said that Greenland is located on the shipping lanes between the United States and Europe, and its fate is vital to the United States. Connecticut Democratic Congressman Stanley said that if one of the warring countries in Europe wants to occupy the island, the United States should protect it. New Jersey Republican Congressman Eaton said, "Denmark and Greenland are the location of a new world crisis." (Havas, 12th)</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Denies German Troops Passing Through</h3>
<p>Moscow: According to the Berlin correspondent of the "New York Times", most of the German troops occupying Narvik passed through Leningrad and Murmansk.

<h3>German Aircraft Fly Over Paris; Repelled by Anti-Aircraft Fire</h3>
<p>Paris: Yesterday, German aircraft were conducting reconnaissance flights throughout France. Several German aircraft reached the Paris area in the evening, but were forced to turn back by anti-aircraft fire. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<h3>Japanese People Fear Going to War; Violate National Mobilization Law; Those in Vocational Circles Avoid Registering</h3>
<p>Tokyo: "Miyako Shimbun" reported that Japanese authorities have now found the results of the national vocational registration system unsatisfactory. Since its implementation, there have been about 3,000 people violating these regulations in Tokyo alone. The national vocational registration system is implemented in accordance with Article 21 of the National Mobilization Law, which stipulates that people in 134 designated occupations must report their age, address, and other relevant information to the vocational department of the local government so that the authorities can conscript necessary personnel for wartime needs. Now, in Tokyo, there are daily cases of people who are required to register not registering or making false reports. Graduates of Russian, Spanish, and Mongolian language departments and those who can drive cars are especially unwilling to report to the authorities. In light of this situation, the Tokyo Vocational Department and the Ministry of Health and Welfare have decided to take stricter measures against those who refuse to report, as this system has now passed its one-year trial period since its implementation.

<h3>British-Japanese Talks in Tokyo; Craigie Dined at Arita’s Luncheon; US Commissioner to the Philippines to Visit Tokyo for Discussions with Ambassador Grew</h3>
<p>Tokyo: Japanese sources said that Japanese Foreign Minister Arita invited British Ambassador Craigie and members of the British Embassy to a luncheon at his official residence today. Sir Craigie has temporarily postponed his departure for the United States for vacation, but it is widely believed that he will travel to the United States soon. It was also reported from Manila that US Commissioner to the Philippines, Sayre, will arrive in Tokyo on the "President Pierce" on the 18th of this month to hold important military discussions with US Ambassador Grew. Sayre will be accompanied by his wife and Naval Attaché Lieutenant Commander Eckvall. It is expected that he will return to Manila from Kobe by ship on May 6. The public attaches great importance to Sayre’s visit, as Grew will return to the United States for vacation after Sayre leaves Japan for Manila. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>London: British MP Sandeman said yesterday that the Japanese have blockaded the British concession in Tianjin for about nine months, and the residents are living in detention, their businesses are being destroyed, and they are suffering humiliation. How long will this situation be tolerated? Under-Secretary of State Butler replied that talks to resolve the Tianjin issue are currently underway in Tokyo. The Japanese government, in view of the British negotiations, is well aware of the British government's attitude towards restricting British trade and discriminating against British shipping. The British government is now closely watching the general issues related to improving British-Japanese relations. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<h3>Britain Should Strengthen Aid to China: Hollington Tong's Proposal</h3>
<p>London: Hollington Tong, Chairman of the Manchester China Relief Committee, wrote to the Manchester Guardian today that after the establishment of the Nanjing puppet government, Britain should provide stronger, not weaker, aid to the real government of China. Britain may not yet realize that Japan is still completely unable to conquer even its so-called occupied areas. There are now one million guerrillas in East China who continue to fight behind Japanese lines. The establishment of the puppet government is an attempt by Japan to reverse its military failure through conspiracy. Any recognition of the puppet government by Britain, even if indirect, will undoubtedly help Japan to finally achieve its goal of driving Western powers out of the Far East. (Reuters, 12th)</p>

<h3>Japanese Munitions Industry Deformed Development; Munitions Merchants Suddenly Become Rich and Display Elegance by Playing with Calligraphy and Painting</h3>
<p>Tokyo: According to "Chugai Commercial News", the munitions industry has developed abnormally since the outbreak of the China Incident. For two years now, shareholders of general munitions factories and owners of tea houses and taverns have become extremely wealthy and are competing to purchase precious calligraphy and paintings to show their elegance. The prices of calligraphy and paintings have increased by ten to twenty times compared to 1937. Among them, ancient Buddhist statues, which have always been enjoyed by business tycoons, have also soared in price. However, there are more fakes in ancient paintings, and buyers are easily deceived. Therefore, nouveau riche buyers prefer the works of modern famous painters. When Kyoto's famous painter Shoen Uemura auctioned off a painting the other day, the price rose to 17,000 yen, but after police intervention, it was deemed too expensive and was finally sold for 15,000 yen.

<h3>Soybeans Can Be Made into Spray Paint</h3>
<p>New York: Soybeans, a specialty of China, can be used to make soy milk and are known as "Chinese milk." Two years ago, the DuPont Motor Company here used them as a raw material to try to make spray paint, which has now been successfully completed. It is of excellent quality, has a natural color, is not affected by sunlight and gasification, and the car, once sprayed, only needs to be washed regularly to maintain its beauty and become more durable. The shiny and gorgeous car bodies of the latest models of cars are due to the use of soybean-based spray paint. It is expected that after the promotion of this new invention, the world's car spray paint industry will be completely changed. (Havas, 11th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Nurses Insufficiently Distributed</h3>
<p>Tokyo: According to "Kokumin Shimbun", Japan originally had 10,000 female nurses, but due to their dispatch to serve in China and "Manchukuo", the number has decreased to only a little over 7,000, which is felt to be insufficiently distributed. The 375 nurses' associations here are now working hard to recruit new nurses to replenish the ranks. (Havas, 11th)</p>

<h3>Japan to Revise Restrictions on the Pearl River</h3>
<p>Tokyo - Japanese sources report that the Japanese Army and Navy Commanders in South China issued a joint announcement this morning, stating that restrictions on trade on the Pearl River will be revised from the 20th of this month. Within the scope that does not hinder military operations, general trade will be permitted up to Guangzhou. The Japanese authorities have informed third-country authorities, stating that foreign ships are now permitted to navigate the Pearl River carrying general goods, provided they comply with the existing conditions regarding navigation and anchoring. Goods harmful to the maintenance of peace and order, and pacification efforts, will be treated as contraband. Third-country authorities should notify the Japanese authorities in advance of any goods destined for Guangzhou. According to Mr. Kita, the Japanese Consul-General in Guangzhou, the current measures do not represent a complete reopening of the Pearl River for navigation and trade. However, he hopes that the restrictions will be modified as much as possible and hopes for sympathetic understanding and cooperation from third countries towards Japan's true intentions.

<h3>Heated Electioneering is a Thing of the Past, New Directors to Take Office on Schedule, Election of Chairman and Vice-Chairman on the 18th, All Parties Give Unified Attention to the Proposed Tax Increase</h3>
<p>The results of the Shanghai Municipal Council director election were announced yesterday, and the outcome of five British, two American, and two Japanese directors being elected has been confirmed, maintaining the original situation. The Japanese ambition to monopolize the concession through an election victory has been completely shattered. Recalling four years ago, in 1936, the Japanese also made a request to increase the number of Japanese directors. At that time, due to the strong attitude of the British and Americans, they were unable to achieve their objective. This is the second failure. However, although the Japanese have suffered these repeated failures, their desire to control the concession and feast on it is not willing to quietly cease. They will undoubtedly continue to use legal advancements to assist illegal seizures, and at the same time use illegal threats to promote legal advancements. Thus, it remains for the British, Americans, and other foreign residents in Shanghai to handle this situation well.</p>
<p>British and American Victory, Hearts Greatly Relieved</p>
<p>At the beginning of the Shanghai Municipal Council director election, the Japanese decided to tear up the gentlemen's agreement of the five-two-two British-American-Japanese ratio. They publicly declared that they had mastered a "secret strategy for certain victory." In recent days, they have been using their military and political special forces to work and coerce all parties from top to bottom. Their strength is indeed not to be underestimated. However, yesterday morning's announcement revealed that the British and Americans had defeated them. Their desire to seize Shanghai has already failed. After the news of this victory was revealed in the newspapers yesterday morning, both Chinese and foreigners were greatly relieved. It is fervently hoped that the seven British and American directors who were elected will uphold the spirit they showed when participating in the election, and serve the concession with their original intentions, with the welfare of millions of Chinese as the foundation, and maintain close contact with the five Chinese directors. In that case, the interests of third countries in the concession can not only be ensured, but also the increasing prosperity of the concession can be expected.</p>
<p>Re-elected Chinese Directors, Candidates for Chinese Committee Members</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council recently approved a letter from the Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers Association, stating that Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Ludeng, Guo Shun, Jiang Yiping, and Xi Yushu have been elected by the current meeting of ratepayers as Chinese directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council for the years 1940 to 1941. In addition, Lin Kanghou, Xu Guanqun, Xu Xiaochu, Liu Shifang, Li Wenjie, and Chen Tingrui have been elected as Chinese committee members of the Shanghai Municipal Council. Furthermore, Jin Zongcheng has been appointed as a real estate committee member of the Shanghai Municipal Council.</p>
<p>Newly Elected Directors to Take Office on Schedule</p>
<p>The election of the Shanghai Municipal Council directors by the Chinese, British, American, and Japanese has been completed. It is reported that the nine newly elected foreign directors and the five re-elected Chinese directors are scheduled to take office in the meeting room of the Shanghai Municipal Council on the 18th of this month, the day after the ratepayers' annual meeting on the 17th of this month. The chairman and vice-chairman will also be elected at that time.</p>
<p>All Parties Pay Attention to the Proposed Tax Increase</p>
<p>The annual meeting of foreign ratepayers is scheduled to be held at 2:30 PM on the 17th of this month. The proposal to increase the municipal general tax, special property tax, and land tax surcharge by 51% is receiving unanimous attention from all parties. At a time when the market is outwardly strong but inwardly weak, and the livelihoods of the citizens are extremely difficult, it is hoped that this proposal will be rejected at the meeting. Furthermore, foreign residents attending the annual meeting must comply with the provisions of Article 19 of the Land Regulations, which states that "Only ratepayers who are absent from the consular area or unable to attend the meeting due to illness may authorize a representative to attend and vote at the ratepayers' annual meeting. The authorization must be in the form of a written authorization certificate, signed by the authorizing ratepayer, and must state the reason within the certificate. If due to illness, a medical certificate must also be submitted. The authorization form can be obtained from the Shanghai Municipal Council Revenue Office."</p>
<p>Japanese Failure, Subsequent Remarks</p>
<p>Mr. Lin Xiongji (Chairman of the Japanese Residents' Election Committee) made a statement, the gist of which is as follows: "It is regrettable that this election failed to achieve the expected goal. As the Chairman of the Election Committee, I feel that I have no excuse to face the Japanese residents. Regarding the issue of the concession, we originally advocated abandoning the dictatorial state and seeking true 'internationalization' to make Shanghai an ideal,</p>
<p>International City</p>
<p>in order to improve the happiness of the residents. This noble proposition is completely different from egoists. However, the most important thing in the election is not who wins or loses, but the correctness of the platform. In order to implement our reasonable proposition, we will redouble our efforts and continue to struggle until we succeed. Whether this election was conducted fairly and appropriately, and the unreasonable points of the current election system, should be</p>
<p>Fully Reviewed</p>
<p>and appropriate measures should be taken to amend them. We will never be discouraged by the results of this election. To prepare for a comeback in next year's election, we should start preparing from today." Lin Xiongji's statement has at least a semi-official nature. His "ambition" has not died, which is conceivable. Furthermore, a spokesperson for the Japanese Embassy told Western reporters yesterday, "The ultimate goal of the Japanese government is to abolish the consular jurisdiction and concession powers here, but</p>
<p>This Ideal</p>
<p>is difficult to achieve in a short time. As a last resort, we seek to improve the administration of the International Settlement. The results of the Shanghai Municipal Council director election have now been announced, but the process was tortuous and still needs to be investigated. The Japanese hope to obtain a superior position in the Shanghai Municipal Council has never changed. I further hope to achieve this wish through legal procedures, but this statement does not imply the use of various illegal means.</p>
<p>British and American Residents</p>
<p>believe that the revision of the Land Regulations of Yangjingbang is not yet the time, which is extremely unreasonable from the Japanese point of view. The establishment of these regulations began in 1846. In the face of the rapid progress of the world, the old regulations are certainly difficult to meet the current needs." In addition, he also attacked the principle of using property as the standard for the number of directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council. He said, "As the world evolves, we should</p>
<p>Value Population</p>
<p>rather than property, but Shanghai's adherence to the old ways is truly astonishing. If this principle can be established, then the Shanghai Municipal Council can be managed by nine millionaires." Finally, the spokesperson also expressed his willingness to congratulate all those elected, saying, "Elections are a kind of competition, and both sides should maintain the personality of a competitor."</p>
<p>A Retrospective Account of Tallying Votes Through the Night</p>
<p>After voting closed simultaneously in the Fuzhou Road International Settlement Volunteer Corps drill ground and the Hongkou Xiaocai Chang districts at 3:00 PM the day before yesterday, the supervisor at the International Settlement Volunteer Corps drill ground, Mr. Browns (Norwegian), ordered assistants to move ballot boxes No. 2 and No. 4 to the Shanghai Municipal Council meeting room and begin checking the registration forms and permits. Half an hour later, the supervisor at the Hongkou Xiaocai Chang, Mr. Bullingert (Swedish), also arrived, and Japanese and Indian police officers carried ballot boxes No. 1 and No. 3. The ballot boxes were opened and votes were tallied at around 5:00 PM. Sixteen assistants participated in the vote tallying, including two Japanese assistants. The meeting room was immediately closed at that time, and extra Western, Indian, Chinese and Japanese police officers and patrolmen were dispatched to guard the door. The vote tallying work was not completed until 3:20 AM yesterday morning. Senior Shanghai Municipal Council officials, such as Director-General Fellypus, Deputy Director-General Cabot, Director Neasy, Assistant Allen, and Director of the Intelligence Office Fulan Shan, all worked through the night. In particular, the election affairs assistant specially appointed by the Municipal Council was the most nervous, as he had to be consulted by the supervisors at any time. The work was not completed until 4:00 AM yesterday morning.</p>
<p>British and American Foreign Residents Should Know to Be Awakened</p>
<p>A Reuters dispatch from Chongqing on the 12th states that a New China Daily editorial this morning issued a warning to foreign countries, roughly stating that yesterday's Shanghai International Settlement Municipal Council director election should make all countries understand Japan's intention to dominate China and completely exclude foreign interests. The current situation in Shanghai is a direct result of foreign appeasement policies towards Japan. In the past two and a half years, the Shanghai Municipal Council has accepted every request made by the Japanese. However, every time the Municipal Council makes a concession, the Japanese will follow it up with a new request. The Japanese objective is to exclude the rights and interests of third countries in China. This election is only part of the Japanese process. Although the British and Americans are able to maintain the status quo at this moment, it can be asserted that the Japanese will inevitably exert stronger pressure. Foreign residents in China should urge their respective governments to change their policies and provide China with material assistance in order to effectively curb Japanese aggression in order to preserve their own rights and interests in China.</p>
<h3>The Attitude of the Newly Elected Directors, Mr. Allman Claims He Benefited from His Surname, Mr. Carnell is Willing to Invite Reporters to Drink Beer</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's foreign directors election concluded yesterday morning at 3:30 AM after extremely tense competition, maintaining the five-two-two ratio of British, American, and Japanese directors. American director Allman received the most votes, with 80,000 votes, and was the most watched. The statements of the elected candidates are recorded below.</p>
<p>Mr. Allman is the Most Popular</p>
<p>The English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post reports that the results of the Shanghai Municipal Council director election have been announced. When asked why Mr. Allman received the most votes, he replied that unexpected events are inevitable. His surname begins with the letter A and is listed at the top of the ballot, making it the easiest to fill in. Furthermore, he did not wish to express any further opinions.</p>
<p>Mr. Carnell Promises to Treat Reporters to Beer</p>
<p>Mr. Carnell of Standard Oil stated that he was quite pleased with the results of this election and that he was the second-highest vote-getter, but he did not say anything else. When asked when he would fulfill his promise made during the election campaign, Mr. Carnell said he had not made any promises. The reporter told him that he was willing to provide news reporters with free wine every day. Mr. Carnell laughed upon hearing this and said that this promise can be fulfilled immediately.</p>
<p>The Japanese Representative is Disheartened</p>
<p>Mr. Yuta Hanawa, manager of Mitsui Bussan Kaisha, who was re-elected, replied to reporters, "We have done our best. It is very regrettable that we have failed." When asked if the restoration of police administration on the north bank of the Suzhou Creek would therefore be delayed, Mr. Hanawa replied, "That is not the case. This is a separate matter." Furthermore, according to Japanese lawyer Koichi Okamoto, he did not want to talk too much because he had lost the election. However, he did not feel particularly surprised because it was inevitable that two Japanese candidates would lose, but he could not predict which one would lose. This is irreversible, he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Kezia Will's Witty Reply</p>
<p>Mr. Kezia Will, the British candidate who received the most votes, also did not wish to make any statement. Mr. Bawyer, the manager of Asiatic Petroleum Company who was elected, had stated during the election campaign that the Shanghai Municipal Council's administrative policy must be better publicized. He replied to reporters, "I do not know you. It is not convenient to make statements of this nature over the phone."</p>

<h3>Yu Qiaqing Righteously Takes Action, Mortgages Private Property to Advocate Price Controls on Rice, Borrows One Million Yuan with Self-Owned Property as Security, to Fund Price Controls in Sanbei and the City</h3>
<p>Shanghai business leader Yu Qiaqing's telegram reads: Respectfully to Chairman Jiang and Executive Directors Kong, Song, and Qian of the Chongqing Joint Office of the Four Banks, my hometown of Sanbei relies entirely on cotton for agricultural production, and its food relies on external supply. Last year, in order to obey government orders, cotton production was purchased by the Agricultural Bank at a low price, and the farmers' economy has become extremely depressed. Food prices have also reached more than 40 yuan per stone due to control and transportation difficulties, which is unsustainable and will lead to starvation. In addition to sending a separate telegram requesting government relief, we have decided to urgently advance funds to purchase foreign rice and transport it back to our hometown to carry out price controls. The Shanghai Price Control Committee has also been assisted by donations from enthusiastic people in various industries and sectors, which has lasted for three months. Judging from the current situation, it is impossible not to continue to do so. Since Sanbei is concerned with hometown feelings, and Shanghai is involved in leading the association's affairs, we cannot shirk our responsibility. A total of two million yuan in working capital is required for both locations to make ends meet. Although we have received assistance from fellow villagers and enthusiastic people, we are still short of half of that. After repeated consideration, we plan to borrow one million yuan from local banks and firms using the Shanghai prime real estate self-owned by Hode, valued at 1.5 million yuan, as security to fund price controls in both locations, for a period of six months. After contacting them, given that this matter is a righteous act and there is collateral to guarantee it, the various banks and firms have collectively decided to provide half of the amount. There is still a shortage of 500,000 yuan. We plan to ask the Four Banks to undertake this, and hereby submit this special telegram. We earnestly request that you instruct the Shanghai branch of the Four Banks to jointly accept the mortgage funds so that we can achieve our goal. We are eagerly awaiting your instructions, Yu Hede respectfully.</p>
<h3>Taxi Fares to Increase Today</h3>
<p>Four major taxi companies in the city, Yunfei, Xiang Shengtai, and Silver, have agreed to revise taxi fares starting today (the 13th). The fare will be 2.7 yuan per 20 minutes, excluding the driver's tip.</p>
<h3>Shipping Companies Charter Vessels from Hong Kong, Jiangning Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Since some British vessels in Shanghai were ordered to be slightly adjusted, the number of ships has gradually decreased, causing shipping companies to charter ships from Hong Kong recently to sail to Shanghai. It is reported that the British vessel Jiangning has obtained permission from the Hong Kong authorities to be chartered by shipping companies in Shanghai and will arrive in Shanghai from Hong Kong within days.</p>
<h3>Japan Repeats Propaganda of Opening the Yangtze River, Still Unreliable</h3>
<p>The Da Zhong News Agency reports that a spokesperson for the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated a few days ago (the 10th), "The Japanese authorities in China have taken measures to accelerate the reopening of the Yangtze River." A reporter from the Da Zhong News Agency recently met with an economist in the city and asked for his views on the matter. According to his statement, after the National Army withdrew to the west, the ports along the Yangtze River were occupied by the Japanese army. Under the pretext of dangerous navigation and preventing third countries from supplying guerrillas, they blockaded the Yangtze River, prohibiting third-country ships from navigating and goods from being imported. All trade was monopolized by the Japanese. Because the customs offices in the Yangtze River ports have been closed, Japanese goods can be imported without reporting and paying taxes, just like domestic trade in Japan. The gentleman also presented statistics published by China and Japan. According to Japanese statistics, Japanese goods worth 168 million yuan were transported to Central China last year, while according to Chinese customs records, Japanese goods imported into Central China were only worth 81 million yuan. This shows that at least half of the Japanese goods in Central China are not reported and taxed. At present, Japanese goods are flooded in Zhenjiang, Nanjing, Wuhu, Jiujiang, Suzhou, Hangzhou and other ports, and the customs offices in these places have been closed for a long time, and Japanese goods are freely imported. This is the main reason why the Japanese have been reluctant to open the Yangtze River, and it is also one of the reasons why European and American countries have accused Japan of excluding the interests of third countries.</p>
<h3>International Settlement Volunteer Corps to Hold Review Tomorrow, Chairman Fankling to Serve as Reviewing Officer, Commander Osape Resigns</h3>

<p>Farewell to Mr. Osape</p>
<p>Commander Osape of the Volunteer Corps joined the Volunteer Corps in 1898 and has been in office for 42 years. He then served as commander of A Company. He has now completed his term and submitted his resignation this year.

Therefore, a farewell party was held for Mr. Osape at the headquarters of the International Settlement Volunteer Corps on Wednesday evening. In addition, Captain Haskins of the General Staff Headquarters and Captain Brege of the A Company Headquarters resigned in January and this month, respectively.</p>
<h3>French Defense Forces Conduct Review This Morning</h3>

<h3>Correction of Names for Ethnic Minorities in the Southwest, Abolition of Terms Such as Yao Man Zhuang, Names Based on Their Respective Territories</h3>
<p>Regarding the ethnic minorities in the remote areas of southwestern China, such as the Yao, Man, and Zhuang peoples, although their cultures are backward, people have often been disparaging them based on their lifestyle habits, which is not in accordance with the principle of equality. It is confirmed that the National Government has convened a discussion meeting of representatives from the Academia Sinica, the Ministry of Social Affairs, and the Ministry of Education to revise the names of ethnic minorities in the southwest, many of which use insect or animal radicals. The following resolutions have been discussed and agreed upon: (1) Regarding the general names of ethnic minorities, the instructions of the National Government Decree Yu No. 470 issued last August should be followed, and they should be called by the name of their place of residence. (2) For the convenience of academic research, the Secretariat of the Central Committee should be requested to send a letter to the Academia Sinica, detailing the following rules for revision. The principles for ethnic minorities in the southwest are as follows: A, All radicals involving insects, animals, or birds should be changed to the human radical; B, For those who do not apply to the first principle, homophones should be used, such as Man, Yao, and Dong. (3) The names of ethnic minorities, which are adjectives based on their living habits, should be abolished. A joint order has now been issued to the provincial governments to instruct educational institutions to comply.</p>
<h3>The Abduction of Czech Woman Hayes in Hongkou</h3>
<p>The North-China Daily News reports that Czech woman Hayes was kidnapped by the Japanese yesterday (the 11th) and released four hours later. She had injuries on both arms and legs and a severe injury to one eye, presumably from being struck by a pistol butt. Hayes returned to her apartment in Riverfront Apartments last night to recuperate and was unable to describe the incident to reporters. However, it is understood that Hayes is</p>
<p>Handling Catering</p>
<p>for Jewish refugees in Riverfront Apartments. At around 11:15 AM yesterday, on the sidewalk of Bong Road near the Hongkou market, a car with license plate number 4607 suddenly drove up. A Japanese man ordered Hayes to get into the car and sit in the back seat. The car then drove in the direction of Yangshupu. Subsequently, someone saw Hayes struggling and shouting in the car, attempting to escape, but she was eventually subdued. Next to Hayes in the car was a foreigner, similar to a Jewish person. The driver was Chinese. The car drove to a vacant lot on Huade Road. Japanese military police trucks, seeing the situation,</p>
<p>Intervened Immediately</p>
<p>and accompanied Hayes to the military police station for questioning, before she was released. Hayes then went to the Japanese Consulate-General to report the incident and then went to the public hospital for treatment. According to reporters, the car used in the kidnapping was registered under the name of the Japanese Residents' Association. At 2:30 PM yesterday afternoon, the car was found abandoned at the intersection of Seward Road and Broadway and was sent to the Hongkou police station.</p>
<p>It is Generally Believed</p>
<p>that the Japanese suspected Hayes of asking Jewish refugees not to vote for the Japanese candidates in the Shanghai Municipal Council director election, hence yesterday's kidnapping. However, a close friend of Hayes said that Hayes had never discussed the election with anyone.</p>

<h3>Fire on the Riverside of North Chengdu Road Still Burning Yesterday, Losses No Less Than Ten Million Yuan</h3>
<p>The warehouses of Da Xiang Packaging Factory and Gu Tiansheng Machinery Flower Factory at No. 20 to No. 30, Lane 1086, along the Suzhou River on North Chengdu Road, are all owned by Gu Yongfu (62 years old), a native of Pudong. Because the cotton stored in the machinery factory was very large and insufficient for storage, it was sent to two large warehouses rented from Xidouzi Foreign Company as storage warehouses. Unexpectedly, on the afternoon of the day before yesterday (the 11th) at about 4:00 PM, a fire broke out in the warehouses, and the fire has not been extinguished yet.</p>
<p>Black Smoke Curling Upwards</p>
<p>It is still burning. After the reporter rushed to investigate, it was learned that the fire started in warehouse No. 14 on the second floor of the warehouse near No. 4. At the time of the fire, there were dozens of male and female workers working. Unexpectedly, the flames soared, so they fled in panic. The staff in the warehouse thought that the sparks were easy to extinguish, and urgently used the installed fire extinguishers and other equipment to try to rescue them. Unexpectedly, cotton, once ignited, spreads very quickly, and immediately</p>
<p>Bursts Through the Roof</p>
<p>The fire was fierce. The Gu Dasheng Flower Factory next to the warehouse originally had a fire brigade (with two large pump trucks, one small pump truck, and elevators, etc., fully equipped, costing more than 200,000 yuan) and employed several firefighters. Faced with the fire, they hurriedly drew water to extinguish it. When the fire brigades of various districts heard the alarm and drove over, it was like a prairie fire, and they could not communicate. Until yesterday evening, it was still burning. When the reporter went to investigate, he saw the fire brigade vehicles connected, and the belts</p>
<p>Crisscrossing the Ground</p>
<p>Firefighters were either climbing ladders or perched on the roof, holding the nozzles, and trying their best to draw water to inject it. The surrounding area of the fire was patrolled by many Chinese and foreign detectives dispatched by the Xinzha Police Station, and traffic was cut off at both ends to maintain order. Along the banks of the Suzhou River, scorched flowers and debris were piled up like mountains, and water accumulated around the fire site. According to people from Tiansheng Factory, the number of cotton stored by this factory in the two warehouses was limited, only a few hundred pieces of linen bags, iron sheets (for packing), rags, and clipped cotton, etc. The rest was all</p>
<p>Customer Goods Deposited</p>
<p>There are dozens of large and small households, all of whom have fire insurance. Our factory was spared, which is really a great fortune in misfortune, they said. It was learned afterwards that customers such as Kaitai Yongji and other households suffered the greatest losses. As for the insurance companies, Taiping and Anping jointly underwrote more than 4 million, and there are still many small ones to be explored. It is heard that the goods in the two warehouses are worth more than 10 million yuan. At least seven or eight million yuan of cotton was burned in this fire. As for completely extinguishing the fire, it may still take several days.</p>

<p>Commercial News, Food. Rice Merchants Still Thinking of Speculating, Shanghai Has 1.5 to 1.6 Million Bags of Rice in Storage, Enough for Four to Five Months of Food for the City's Residents. Imported Rice is Also Arriving Continuously.</p>
<p>The rice market slightly eased after the supply of domestic rice from the interior increased, causing prices to drop by five to six yuan. People were rejoicing that rice prices could be lowered, but unexpectedly, the price of gold soared a few days ago, making the cost of imported rice prohibitive, and prices rose again. Although two to three thousand bags of domestic rice arrive daily, and it is reported that Dachang Company in Hongkou has already prepared over 40,000 bags of goods in Xichang and other areas, which will also arrive in Shanghai successively, the rice market has not been affected by this at all. Instead, prices have risen by half a yuan to nearly a yuan. This is because everyone tightens their grip as soon as the market opens in the morning, and customers from various groups continue to buy steadily without retreating, creating a good opportunity for merchants to push prices up. Once there is demand, prices rise repeatedly, and floating speculators seize the opportunity to buy low and sell high, which is especially exhilarating. The prices of imported rice have returned to their levels before the price drop. Annam rice is 44 yuan, Saigon No. 1 is 43.5 yuan, Huojiao is 42 yuan, and Xiaojiao is 39.5 yuan. For domestic rice, only very old or water-damaged rice is still traded at normal prices. Sutung water-damaged japonica rice and old Nangang early rice are sold for 40 yuan. The better quality rice has disappeared from the market, and there are many off-market deals. It is said that Changxi Gaote japonica rice is sold for 44.5 yuan, Zhongguan is 43.5 yuan, Changzhou Zhongjing is 41.7 yuan, Kunshan white japonica rice is 42-3 yuan, Qingsi Tebo is 42-3 yuan, and Nangang original package early and late rice is 41-2 yuan. The price of glutinous rice has also increased by 5-6 jiao. However, although the prices of various types of rice continue to rise in the market, it is not easy to raise them sharply, because the supply of domestic rice is smooth and unhindered, imported rice continues to arrive, and the amount of rice stored in Shanghai warehouses is very large. According to industry insiders, the total amount of rice stored in warehouses inside and outside the concession is no less than 1.5 to 1.6 million bags, which is enough to feed the city's residents for four to five months. Therefore, although sales are wide, there is no shortage in the short term. Moreover, scarcity makes goods valuable, while abundance makes them cheap. This is a fixed principle. How can rice prices still rise sharply like before? This current wave of price increases is likely just a turnaround in the market and a necessary change. Yesterday, the entire city rose from the initial wait-and-see to the mid-market high, and then hovered without being able to climb further. The market closed with an increase of only half a yuan to nearly a yuan.</p>
<p>The price of imported rice fluctuates greatly due to international changes and people's nervousness, as well as rumors in the market. However, due to the persistence of the suppliers and the activity of new speculators, as well as the impact of insufficient ship space and high pricing, the market has gradually risen. The price of Saigon No. 2 for the April-May term once fell to 50.02 yuan in the morning, but rebounded in the afternoon, and the price increase was even more frenzied. As a result, the price rose to 51 yuan. The spot price also rose sharply from 49 yuan to 50 yuan. The spot price of Xiaojiao also rose to 48.6 yuan. The spot price was also sharp. The price of No. 1 rose to 43.5 yuan in the morning and then to 44 yuan in the afternoon.

<p>The Tomb of Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai</p>
<p>Twenty miles west of Ningbo City, there is a place called Shaojiadu. The south of it is Yin County, and the north is Ci County, using this river as the boundary between the two counties. On the other bank, there is the Liangjun Temple, and behind the temple is the tomb of Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai. According to legend, during the Jin Dynasty, Liang Shanbo, whose courtesy name was Churen, was from Kuaiji. He studied in the same school as Zhu Yingtai for three years. When Shanbo visited her, he realized she was a woman. He returned to tell his parents and asked for her hand in marriage, but Zhu had already been promised to the Ma family in Shengcheng. When Shanbo became the magistrate, he fell ill and died, leaving instructions to be buried in Sishi Qingdaoyuan. The following year, when Zhu married into the Ma family, her boat passed by Shanbo's tomb. Overcome by the wind, Yingtai went ashore and wailed at the tomb. The ground cracked and she fell in. When the matter was reported to the court, Prime Minister Xie An of the time奏封義婦塚, now the crack in the stone bar in front of the tomb still looks like something from thousands of years ago. Although this story is close to allegory, the record is solid and verifiable, so there may be some truth to it. On the fifteenth day of the second month of this year, the statue was consecrated, and on the first day of the third month, a play was performed to appease the gods. It is also said that the god specializes in progeny, so those who seek children are most likely to have their wishes fulfilled. It is now known that seeking wealth, sailing the seas, taking exams, and all trivial matters can be promised. Reciting a certain number of Lotus Sutras, each costing 72 Wen. Villagers do not use foreign money. Those who promise to recite 100 Lotus Sutras must carry 7,200 Wen in white square coins into the temple to fulfill their vows. This year, the incense is the most prosperous. Those who live in the temple are neither monks nor Taoists nor nuns. It is undertaken by several local families, allocated according to shares, like ancestral property. Every year, the soil on the tomb is dug up and taken home by those who burn incense, saying that it can cure bedbugs, ants, mudfish, flies, etc. Therefore, every year in September, the cost of repairing the tomb and adding soil is drawn from the income from incense. Villagers, couples, officials, and people from other prefectures and counties all write letters. It is said that last year, after deducting all expenses, the temple keeper made a large profit.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Establishes New Singapore Road Primary School; New School Building Not Yet Completed, Enrollment Temporarily at Xinzha Road</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council, recognizing the large number of residents in the Western District and the need to add a primary school, has selected a site at the intersection of Singapore Road and Jiaozhou Road to build a school building, which is being actively constructed. Because the above construction has not yet been completed, and the start of the school term is imminent, it has been decided to temporarily open the school at 1461 Xinzha Road on May 1st. Once the new school building is completed, the school will move in. It is reported that the school will temporarily enroll 250 male and female students in grades 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 this semester. Registration will begin on the 15th of this month at the temporary school building on Xinzha Road. It is also reported that the original tuition fee for each student was nine yuan per semester, but this semester it will be reduced by half, with an additional 15% surcharge. The enrollment prospectus can be obtained at the registration office.</p>
