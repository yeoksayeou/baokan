<h3 id="c2">歐戰新發展 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>前天淸晨，德國軍隊終於什西綫上發動了對荷蘭比利時盧森堡的閃電戰略。我們在評論此一發展的重大影響之前，應該先檢討德國的戰略。一國的對外作戰計割，隨時代之進展，常有修正：但因限於種種客觀環境，特別是受地理環境的拘束，故亦有其不變者在。德國的基本作戰計劃是一八九八年時陸軍參謀總長舒利芬將軍所定的，其要點，以英法聯軍爲假相、敵，以法國領土爲假想戰塲，左翼（德法邊境）主守，右翼主攻，準備以大軍迅速通過荷蘭比利時和盧森堡，直逼法國北部而擊破之。德國這一作戰計劃，曾於一九一四年付諸實行，但因沒有充分顧到帝俄在東綫進襲，影響所及，德軍戰略，全部動搖。所以去年第二次歐戰爆發後，希特勒藉齊格斐防綫之掩護，在西綫暫採守勢，而置大力於征峪波蘭，以除後顧之憂。但是希特勒並沒有放棄了舒利芬計劃，今春東綫局勢稍澄淸後，德國即以全力西向而與英法爭雄。而且希特勒對於舒利芬計劃更加以擴大運用。舒利芬計劃只主張强力通過荷比盧森堡，且因小毛奇將軍之反對，在第一次歐戰中德國並未侵犯荷蘭；而現在希特勒則在進犯比利時盧森堡的同時，更進犯荷蘭，並且在侵略荷比盧森堡前的一月，更侵略丹麥和挪威南部。舒利芬計劃，只以法國領土爲假想戰塲，而希特勒的强占丹挪荷蘭，則又顯然欲在此建立海空軍根據地，以爲進犯英倫三島之凖備。</p>
<p>現在英法聯軍，已紛紛北開助戰。戰局前途究將如何發展，此時尙難斷言；但是德國旣已發動了這一新攻擊，其勢當然相富猛烈，而其影響尤極遠大，客觀判斷，德軍的進犯荷比盧森堡，對於德國，有利，亦有不利，請分析言之。</p>
<p>在戰略上，德國軍隊假如能夠通過比利時盧森堡，對於法國北境，當然是一大威脅。法國的馬奇諾防綫，本來已由德法邊境擴展到法比邊境，但是法比邊境的馬奇諾防綫，興築較遲，設備較弱，却也不容否認。而且德軍的侵入荷比，對於英國，威脅更甚。拿破崙曾經說過：「比荷交界處的安特衛普港，是對準英國心臟的手槍」。德國倘能占有荷蘭和比利時，就可以建立進襲英國南部的海空軍，根據地，正如德國可以在挪威建立進襲英國北部的海空軍根據地一樣。這是有利德國的第一點。在經濟上，比荷對英法的商務關係，都極密切。一九三人年比利時的國際貿易，對法輸出輸入皆占第一位，對英輸出占第二位，輸入占第五位；同年荷蘭的國際貿易，對法較少，對英輸出占第一位，輸入占第四位。德國倘能占領比荷，除了積極的可以獲得兩國的富源外，消極的對於英法打擊亦重。這是有利德國的第二點。</p>
<p>但是戰爭只是政治的延長。德國的攻擊荷比盧森堡，就戰爭本身論，有其理由；倘就政治或外交論，則不能不謂爲有嚴重後果。現在德國在外交上所利的，是義大利的搖旗助威，是蘇聯和美國的中立，其中蘇聯對德在商務上還多少有點幫忙。但是德國的冥行盲進，攻擊荷比盧森堡，如果成功了，則歐陸均勢即不能維持。不但蘇義不安，美國也受威脅。所以德國的急進戰略，頗有產生下列後果的重大可能，即：（一）促進蘇聯和英法間的重行修好；（二）增加墨索里尼對於幫助德國作戰的躊躇；（三）而尤其重要的，是美國對於英法的同情與援助，將因德國侵犯荷比盧森堡而飛躍的增進。這樣，德國的國際形勢將更孤立，德國的外交地位將更削弱，結果所至，當然將有不利的影響於德國之軍事。</p>
<p>隨着歐洲戰事的新發展，英國內閣，業已改組，由威望素隆之邱吉爾氏繼任首相，並擴大內閣之陣容，而增强其力量。英國是大國，在國際間責任較大，過去十年，英國雖然志切和平，而其態度之模稜，行動之遲緩，要亦令人惋惜。侵略國家，有如野火。東西呼應，勢且相連，必須迅赴事機，纔有消滅大禍之望。近來蘇聯既有恢復對英談判的建議於前，美國又有積極反對侵略的表示於後，英國當局，實在應該寳貴這個千鈞一髮稍縱即逝的時機，參加組織一個普及歐亞美三洲的反侵略大陣綫。那麼，歐戰的新發展，將更具有積極的意義了。</p>
<p>白雲蒼狗。世態無常。益以人心日險。生活日高。我人立身處世之不易。於茲已極。若能知命而自定趨避。識人善惡。則自處處人。不難兩全共美。誠爲修身之一助</p>
<p>世之行險圖侥倖者。大抵味於運數。及其涉世漸深。所謀輙左。始悟命運之主宰。有非人力所能倖勝。南史沈攸之嘗言。早知窮達有命。恨不十年讀書。洵屬經驗之談。茲求人人知命。而各守水安分。則上無戰爭之禍。下無攘奪之虞。社會庶可安寧</p>
<p>命雖小道。其理深微。每見硏究此道者。切磋經年。而終不能登堂人室。談言微中。蓋缺乏實地經騐耳。茲以學理實騐。並施無間。無論已學者未學者。均獲捷徑成功。且所授課目。皆切實用。學成後。旣可以自己推算。亦可代人權衡。交際乏衛者。更可</p>

<p>柏林　德軍司令部一九四〇年五月四日、爲德國政府擬具關於比利時之報吿如次、</p>
<p>「一九三六年十月比利時國王宣佈、比利時將來避免與任何外國之締結盟約、而將採取獨立政策、因此一切軍事凖備、不但對付德國、同時亦防備英法、其保證如此、然而事實上、値得提出者有下列十一點、</p>
<p>（一）比國之防務、完全係片面的對付德國、自大戰以後、里奇鎮已成爲西歐最具堅强防務工事之根據地、納穆爾之防務亦大爲增强、反之在法比接壤之處則毫無工事可言、一九三七年夏、比利時參謀總長柏爾根將軍發表演說、申稱、比國防務機構仍係向東、此即證實比利時之單獨防德、一九三八年三月二日、比利時國防部長台尼斯將軍在下院宣稱、比國將保持實施防務計劃之自由權、幷自由與外國諮商或合作、此即承認比利時在國防上與英法兩國之合作是也、一九三九年預算中、已有比國南襲一百萬法郞之防務經費、又增撥款二七〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇佛郎、增强東疆已經固若金湯之防務、然則根據德國偵察機飛往法國偵察之報吿、法比交界固絕無防禦工事之設施、一九四〇年二月八日比利時議員克拉曼斯與國防部長台尼斯在下院熱烈辯論、證實法比邊疆之不設防、雖比國議員亦表不滿、</p>
<p>（二）一九三九年一月、法國後備軍官訓練團總監杜斯將軍、在比京檢閱法國後備軍官學校、比國防部長參與該項典禮及會餐、此舉顯然與比王獨立政策之旨相違背、</p>
<p>（三）比利時與英法軍隊代表常有拌還訪問之事、而對於德軍則絕未採取中立之態度、軍事建築之上、懸掛反德國畫、</p>
<p>（四）根據波蘭參謀本部第二廳所抄獲之公文中、波蘭與比利時兩國之參謀部曾交換關於德國之公文、其中有波蘭駐法公使館武官費達上校一九三七年五月七日致波蘭參謀本部第二應廳長之函一件、其中證明一九三七年五月一日、波蘭駐法武官與比利時參謀本部簽訂協定、規定比國參謀本部得國防部長之許可、與波蘭參謀本部第二廳合作、交換關於德軍消息、保守絕對秘密、所交換之情報由波蘭駐比武官轉達、</p>
<p>（五）比利時軍隊之公佈、完全片面對德、自一九三九年九月底起、比國軍隊即大部份集中東北疆界、十月下半月比國二十一師兵力中、調東北者達十四師比京附近三師、十一月七日夜宜佈軍中一律不許吿假、同時英法軍隊集結比疆、比利時不但不加以防備、抑且本年一月十四日尙有明令、不許比國兵士向法軍開槍、</p>
<p>（六）其他技術上措施、亦係專門對付德國、如德比通路之軍事障碍物增多、而法比之間者則予以移除、居民之疏散、亦僅限於東部、反而移往法比邊境、</p>
<p>（七）自一九三九年十月起、比利時即已準備幫助英法、任令協的國軍、於必要時假道比利時領土、一九三九年十一月十一日比法邊界之警察奉到命令、掃除道路以備聯軍之開入、一切車輛集中備用、一九三九年十二月二日安登尼斯市長奉令爲法軍凖備宿營地、法國軍事工程師更監督比國工人修造防務、英國工程師則監造重砲砲臺、一九四〇年四月二十日英國輪船滿載英軍所用之軍火、抵達安特溫浦、足見自去年十月起、比利時即決定贊助英法、比利時軍隊所擔負之工作、爲阻截德軍而進窺魯爾區、</p>
<p>（八）自英法之調動軍隊及空軍偵察之結果、證明協約國之左翼、決定從比利時假道攻德、所有機械化步兵及坦克車隊均齊集比利時疆界、</p>
<p>（九）空軍方面英法比密切合作、供給器村、幫助製造、英法飛機屢次侵犯比利時領域、而比國政府視若岡睹、</p>
<p>（十）比利時在海軍方面亦偏袒英法、比國原規定凡外國船隻開入安特溫浦之前、必須將船中三百公斤以上之爆炸物移去、但對英國武裝商船、則不實施該項法令、</p>
<p>（十一）最重要者、厥爲最近接到報告、英國不但早已凖備假道比利時、甚至已在比國空軍掩護、佔領若干飛機塲、根據述各點、充分證明協約國對於比利時之進攻、已經迫於眉睫、（十一日海通電）、</p>

<p>拘獲之盜　係一賭棍</p>
<p>茲據訪悉、當時受傷倒地成擒之盜匪、名吳桂臣、年二十五歲、爲滬西極司非爾路一三五號廣西俱樂部賭窟賭棍、本月十日之晚、因賭負大窘、遂與同伴商刦江海關稅款、五人乘十路公共汽車出發、步行至交通銀行前、實施搶刦、</p>

<p>美國暫禁　荷比提存</p>
<p>惟該兩銀行及荷蘭其他金融機關在紐約之存款、已由美國政府下令暫時停付、故此等存款、不能提取、據美政府解釋、所以取此舉動者、乃欲保護荷比兩國被德軍佔據區內之存戶、使不被侵略者强迫交出其在美持有之外匯、聞荷比兩國非但未請美政府停付存款、抑且要求撤銷此種限制、</p>
<p>德人存款　繼續照付</p>
<p>本市荷國各銀行預料此事將在數日內澄淸、而一切均吿解決、本市荷比商號對於本國遭德國侵略事、尙未接獲荷比政府發來之新訓令、故荷蘭各銀行上海分行、今晨對於德籍公民提取存款、繼續照付、</p>

<p>劃定價格</p>
<p>目下市上煤球價格、每擔雖已由九元半跌至八元四角者、但仍未能劃一、煤球業公會爲劃一市價起見、特呈請市商會定一公平之價格、俾得各煤球廠商遵照實行、聞市商會刻正積極調査煤球之或本及市民之購買力、而定一適當之售價、</p>

<p>市價回跌</p>
<p>此次煤球市價之上漲、僅係一時趨勢、不久即可同跌、緣經當局迭决申令抑低、加以各大囤戶亦紛紛將謀屑出棧、供應市塲、故各煤球廠原料已無缺乏之虞、况其成本亦稍趨减輕、而一般投機者恐遭額外損失、巴無意活躍市塲、大量囤扒、據界義泰與煤公司於四月份共計售出煤屑一七〇二二噸、並悉昨日市塲烟白煤觔俱吿回小、可見煤觔存底之充實矣、</p>

<p>據平準會之某委員稱、本市物質飛漲之癥結所在、界內投機商人之操縱居奇、同爲主要原因之一、而來源問題、實最爲重要、自淪陷區運滬之米糧被限制及苛徵後、本市米價、即不斷高漲、洋米運滬、亦因外匯緊縮、成本增加、無法訂購、故兩租界當局、現正與日方商討疏通來源辦法、惟本市食糧來源雖有困難、但不致造成嚴重之恐慌、因最近來、每日由淪陷區運滬米糧達二千包以上、而本市存米亦足敷消費、匯市劇變前所訂洋米、且尙源源而來、至關於食糧採銷統制機關之建議、因須集軟五千萬元不易、故難實現云、</p>
<p>合理管制</p>
<p>又據可靠方面之表示、本市米煤之來源、旣不致發先恐慌、則對市塲加以合理之管制、亦自可使物價不致過於高漲、故兩租界對改善米煤零售市塲之狀况、琿精竭慮、不遺餘力、除（一）限制煤屑棧單賣出數量、（二）制止食糧之回籠交易等項、均已明令實旋外、最近復將使各商店實行商品標價、並制止各市塲之非法交易行爲、同時並望而民對操縱居奇之商人加以檢舉、予以嚴懲、俾得逐漸歛跡、</p>

<p>自財政部電滬力闢限制提存之無稽、聲明決心維持幣信、安定金融後、平準外匯基余委員會尤竭力維持上海黑市外匯、於是金融币塲謠言全息、人心安定、前日干後起、因德侵荷比盧歐　已擴大、上海金融市塲投機者復施其故技、猛扒外匯搜羅黃金囤積貨物、造成匯縮金漲等不好現象、昨晨起情形已稍緩和英商匯豐銀行外匯掛牌雖不動，而實際交易行市已轉鬆、並有美國貨幣將貶値之謠傳、於是外滙賣風大盛、至於中央銀行之法定外匯掛牌、依然如前、則足證中國之法定外匯、始終不變、</p>
<p>投機操縱　物價高漲</p>
<p>新聲社記者昨向金融界探悉、上海游資充斥、缺乏正當運用途徑、於是造成投機者之操縱、其投機對象、（一）買賣黑市外滙及套利、（二）囤積日用必需之品、（三）貝賣黃金股票證券、（四）經營匯劃非法貼水、（五）買賣外幣及鈔票、以上諸端、均爲促成物價高翔之最大因素、所以今日之日用品、無一不漲、亦無不歸咎於奸商團積、但食品中有不易致腐敗不堪久藏者、其價亦漲、當係被主要品漲價連累而及、一漲則百漲、其爲害民生、自不待言、若不嚴予取締、則社會治安、人民生計、咸蒙影響、</p>
<p>正當商業　蒙受其害</p>
<p>金融市塲之謠諑、如春雲之時展時收、富無一週無之、最近謠傳政府不維持黑市外匯、及再度限制提存、今雖經財政部力闢謠言之無稽、於是是項謠言、始吿平息、頃因德侵荷比市塲又有新謠言、投機者大施其技、以其全力操縱一切、今外匯行市如此變動猛烈、於正當商業、有弊無利、故匯市由絢爛而歸於平淡、應爲人人所歡迎、惟藉以投機射利者始疾首蹙額耳、其他股票黃金等市塲亦然、故將上海之游資內移、爲目前刻不容緩之事、</p>

<p>外滙昨日市况、滙豐掛牌、悉無上落英美滙暗市變動出於意外、在歐戰擴大之際、美滙由緊突吿猛鬆、英滙亦見盤長、聞因歐洲交戰國資金、由香港逃避、集於滬上、爲數日巨、月荷·比被侵、本市中西商羣起向荷·比等商行、擠提存款、一部份外幣存戶有轉塞於美商等行者、而因美銀行吸胃有限、致有一部份在暗市塲拋塞、更有美金或將貶値傳說、外銀行均少進胃、故美金曾由四元五三一二五直硬至四元八一二五可結、先令亦步鬆至三辦士六二五、十一點半左右、某華行稍有納胄、且賣風漸息、故見稍回、終先令三辦士五六二五、美余四元七一八七五、英長一二五、美長〇九三七五、下午週六無市、</p>

<p>美鈔起落不定</p>
<p>昨日外幣市况、英美金辦晨初稍有需要·市價略漲、但不久即因金價急轉直下、故亦隨之趨跌、結果各降三元、英金票以黑市英匯大鬆、各方供給頗暢、市價猛降二元五角、美金票始以英鎊慘落、晨初高至二十二元、但旋因紛傳英鎊連朝頻跌、間接影響美國出口貿易非淺、故一般神經過敏者、均料美幣或將貶値、致黑市美匯大鬆、美金票一度退至二十元零五角、後稍回堅、卒爲二十一元一角、比上日軋跌四角半、香港票隨港滬匯兌猛降二角、法郞票及新荷·安南·羅比·坎·菲列濱票等供給均暢、市價一致趨下、日金票供給亦旺、市價疲弱、晚市爲一元二角七分五厘、朝鮮票需要激减市盤猛降二分、晚市爲九角八分、</p>

<p>昨日本市現金烚赤暗市、差强人意、以前晚收盤後之塲外趨勢、衆料必漲無言、豈知昨晨金市跌風重熾、已回入七千元大關內、竟在歐戰益烈、荷比被侵之際、殊出意外、實因傳美金元或將貶値、並且歐洲交戰國資金流滬、及中西商紛向荷比，行提存轉存美銀行、更有一部份在黑市塲拋塞英美滙突吿劇鬆所致、各方人心復吿虛軟晨開即低爲七千〇五十元、嗣買氣一度濃烈、曾飛上至七千一百三十元高價、奈外滙猛鬆甚勁、余號證劵幫傾售、進戶束手、遂起慘烈跌風、在落見六千八百七十元低價、近午隨外滙復昂至七千元關口、收市六千九百七十元、計回小一百二十元、下午週六例假、上半日交易共三千兩、飾金亦盤小十元、爲七百十元、關金等均平、</p>

<p>另訊外棉市價、紐約棉市、晨初開盤殊呈疲乏之狀、跌落十餘磅音、後因投機者之賣出、及因歐洲局勢之惡劣、海外棉商之在市賣出、市况異常混亂、結果收盤價格、較之上日近期跌四十磅音、遠聖跌三十磅昔、印度棉市因德侵荷比、荷比剛國所購之印棉、悉數取銷成單、加之速東需要淡薄、故昨日暴跌十八羅比、預測回漲三羅比、埃及跌二十餘磅音、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、因歐洲局努之惡劣、運輸困難益增、故滬上現貨交易異常良好、其售價却不因海外棉市之低落、價格反見高昂、天津幫進胃頗健、市上現貨、被搜購者已佔大半、據照目前趨勢、路貨亦將跟風情俐矣、茲將昨日棉市、以美匯四元五六二五折合送廠價如下、</p>

<p>南海中有牛奇島者，在中國之東南，而英屬澳斯的里亞，即華人所名新金山之北也。該島居民，大半悍而無禮，與中國台灣之生番相等，新金山人屢欲至該島貿易，輒為所害。前有一船從谷當埠開往，方至一小島，有一華水手患病，遂置於此，另派一年幼英人為伴，該船遂沿海岸而去，去即杳如黃鶴。後有船繼至，華水手病巳痊可，遂與年幼英人附輪而往該島，適遇島民之略知理法者，詢其前船何在，則云為本島食人黨六人所食，且指引該黨住處，該船循海而往，已見食人黨人擁聚一處；遙詰之，彼認食人不諱，且示以骨，又言遇爾等白人，安得不果我腹，該船知難與論，怏怏而歸。泰西諸國，皆深惡此種殘暴之事，每致兩國有因此而失和者，即以中國論，前英人馬嘉理為騰越土人所殺，幾搆兵端，琉球人為台灣生番所殺，日本妄效泰西，無端生釁，今牛奇島殘害英民至於如此，初未聞興一旅之師以問罪，　獨何也。大約因該地瘴氣甚盛，無如之何，然則友邦之友好，不敵瘴氣之逼人矣。噫！</p>

<p>凡母親沒有不原兒女做好人的，有的時候，兒女的壞處，父親忽略了，母親却看得很清楚。母親有窺破道德上的危險的本能，她對於正義的影響，比一切律法，敎育，和敎師都大。自然，世上有不少壞心的母親，如古時候的耶西別，還有下戝，無人心的母親，賣兒賣女。不過，這些都是出乎情理之外的人，不配有母親的名稱。古來賢母如哈拿，兒子一出世，卽獻給上帝，實在很多。林肯說，「我現在怎樣，將來希望怎樣，皆得力於我天使般的賢母。」（二）「母親」暗示出信徒的服務，母親對兒女的犧牲，虔心，適足表證信徒的理想服務。今日時髦女子，有許多要逃避做母親的責任，到社會去活動，其實世上的事業，就子女講，沒有比做母親更偉大的。母親是那樣勇敢的負起她的重担，那樣耐煩的忍受她的痛苦，正如爲主殉道的敎師，雖赴湯蹈火不辭，可敬可佩之極。某君在母親節演說，道，「我們思念母親，就是要回想到她的不自私的，無限止的，堅定的愛心，不論境遇好歹，她的愛心與日月俱增光大，她不望報，只願我們做上等人。若是我們不肖；未能照她所期望的做到，她仍愛我們不衰，母親真是奇妙，永久，不可思議阿！」母親做人是否徒勞，全看我們如何。若是我們自甘暴棄，不思拯按，　親的犧牲，算是枉然了。所以，我們要孝敬母親，以母親的名義興辦善事，使母親得榮耀。（三）「母親」暗示出天家，母親是家庭的主腦和皇后。一個家庭，沒有母親，決不成其爲家庭。有人問一個孩子說，「你的家在那裏？」孩子回答說，「母親所在的地方，卽是我的家。」這是實情。基督徒對於天家的觀念，也就是完善家庭。我們以這樣的態度度量爲人，方適於做天家的兒女。（完）</p>

<p>— 新亮</p>
<p>小朋友們，你們大槪都知道五月八日是國際母親節吧。母親從十月懷胎以至將你們養大成人，其間正不費盡了多少心思，吃盡了多少苦痛；如今，你們大半都在學校裏念書，午飯回家，小菜放好在檯上等你去吃，散學後，又是一番好言的安慰，可是，你曾想到過「愛」你的母親嗎？「母親」是世界上最偉大的，可是，你曾想到過怎樣來報答伊老人家嗎？</p>
<p>我們都應該愛我們的母親，在這裏，我就想說幾句話，我更希望諸位小朋友在讀了之後能够各自捫心自問一下，自己有沒有做到這樣的地步，那末，才可算不把這個大可寶貴的母親卽虛度了。</p>
<p>第一，在我以爲愛我們的母親應該用行動來表示。換句話說，就是我們該有實在的工作做出來。接受母親的好言，立定主意做一個有志氣的孩子。舉個例來說吧，岳飛把「盡忠報國」實際的行動來做一個愛國男兒，在歷史上非但自己被人千古散仰着，而且他的母親，同樣地也被我們讀頌着呢。我想，每個母親都希望你能轟轟烈烈地做一番事業，就像岳飛的母親一樣，那末，你爲什麼不就從今天開始努力起來呢？</p>
<p>其次，除了要立定一個大志之外，你們就該在目前儘可能的用功讀書，你們要知道，當今生活艱難，家長們賺幾個錢真太不容易了，你年紀尚小雖不能幫忙負担家庭，但就該在本位上努力，設或你能够讀到一個免費，你的母親豈不大大的將感到歡喜嗎？之外，一切零用，都該節省，你得知道：你媽身邊沒零錢時，你偏跑上去問他要，那伊將感到多麼的難過呵！</p>
<p>設或你母親不幸已不在世上了，那末，你就該更加努力，更加發奮的做個好孩子，才不負你母親培養你的一番辛苦。</p>
<p>請牢記住吧，每位親愛的小朋友，讓我們來「愛」母親！讓我們來用實際的努力「愛」母親：每個母親止期待着你的成功呢。</p>

<p>小朋友！生你的是誰？當然是你的母親。養育你的是誰？也是你的母親。當你看了襁褓裏的小弟弟，小妹妹，那種嗷嗷待哺，呀呀學語的情形，一定會想起你的母親是如何敎養你成人的。</p>
<p>世界上，所有做母親的，都愛護着自己的子女。他們愛子女的心，是無微不至的。那末，一般做子女的怎麼可以不敬重他的母親，孝順他的母親呢？</p>
<p>前四大是母親節。那時候，全世界的小朋友，正懷着赤誠，現着天真，在祝福他們的母親呢！我知道，一向敬愛母親的你們，當更虔誠</p>
<p>不過，我們要怎樣來祝福我們的母親，報答母親的恩惠呢？小朋友唯一可以報答母親於萬一的，只有好好地聽從母親的話，不使老人家生氣；在家裏，幫助母親處理家事，照料弟妹，以分擔一部分的辛勞；在學校裏用功讀書，鍛鍊體格，準備將來爲國效力。這樣，母親們才會對着未來的青年有希望，雖然他的辛苦，也就感着無上欣慰了。</p>
<h3 id="c106">蠶 <a href="#c106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>— 蘇明</p>
<p>天是漸漸地和暖了，庸兒的記憶力真不差，還能記得去年蠶蛾撒下來的卵紙安放在他抽屜的角隅裏。他便用棉花把它裹了起來，因天暖的關係，沒有幾天便出了無數如蛆一般的小黑蠶。於是庸兒除了讀書外，其他的功夫，都在照顧那蠶了。</p>
<p>在上海，要我一些桑葉來餵蠶，委實不是件容易的事。庸兒家裏已很狹窄，那裏有空地來種植桑樹呢？於是他只得把心愛的蠶向有桑葉的同學交換，更東打聽，西問訊的拜託人家，要求一些蠶的食料。蠶吃了桑葉便漸漸地長大了，眼見得那黑色的小身體慢慢的變成灰白色，身子也不知不覺的伸長了不少，這使庸兒好生歡喜，不過蠶的食料也隨着增加了。</p>
<p>「真討厭！那裏來的桑葉呢？還是把它們丟了罷。」母親眼見庸兒自養了蠶後，把功課無形中疏忽了，他放了學回家，手中總拿着一些桑葉，一到了家，丟了書包，立即到外邊去找桑葉，他一天到晚把蠶兒的食料放在自己的心上。於是伊老人家這樣的說着。「媽，丟倒不要丟，如果桑葉不够了。養蠶倒是一個很好的動物實騐，可以得到不少活的智識。可惜人家都不去注意它。」明兒在勞插口說。</p>
<p>「這樣叫活的智識」？庸兒倒不懂起來了。</p>
<p>明兒便把一條蠶放在手掌上，指着說道：「蠶是蠶蛾的幼虫，外形上可分爲頭，胸，腹三部，頭部很短小有一對細毛角角，每側有六個極細小的眼，可惜我們的肉眼不能察見，將來長大後，我可以指給你看。胸部出三個體節合成，下生三對脚，腹部有十節，生脚五對，最後一對，稱尾足，腹部第八節上生一個突起的東西叫尾角。身上更有九對氣門用來呼吸，八對在腹旁，一對在胸側。蠶身很柔軟，沒有內部的骨骼，身上只生着堅硬的角質層，這算爲它的外骨骼，此外骨骼不能隨身體長大，所以蠶要經過四次的蛻皮，才能結繭。它也有口部，可惜瞧不見。身體內部有循環器，呼吸器，排洩器，感覺器，所謂「身體雖小，五臟俱全。」蠶體更奇特的，在胃的兩旁，生絲腺，這腺的分泌物，從口部的小孔中吐出來，遇到空氣，便硬結成絲了。蠶得卵孵化時，體呈灰黃色而有毛，蛻皮後，毛便脫除，慢慢地變成淡青色，它經過四次的蛻皮，才長足，便吐絲作繭，把自己的身體藏在繭裏，再蛻皮變成蛹，經過幾日後，蛹再蛻皮，化成蠶蛾，破繭出來，那才是蠶蛾。這許多便是活的智識。桑葉本是蠶的唯一食料，可是在三年以前，日本有位農學博士，用各種植物的葉來餵蠶，結果得到一種新法，即撇桑葉於蒿苣之上，用這方法所養的蠶，和把桑葉來餵的蠶一模一樣，你不妨試試看，如成功的話，桑葉問題倒可解決了，用蒿苣葉來餵蠶，倒是件從來沒有聽見的新鮮事。」</p>

<p>— 何公超</p>
<p>新寓言</p>
<p>有三隻猴子，給獵人追到了河邊河水深闊，他們又不會游水真是危急萬分。幸而河的兩岸，各有一顆桃樹，兩樹的枝頭，離得很近。牠們情急智生，彼此手和手連起來，由其中一隻握了這岸的樹枝，一，二，三，大家一齊宕起來，最下的一隻猴子，宕過河去，搶住了對岸的樹枝，然後，這岸的猴子放手，於是三隻猴子就都到了對岸，在樹枝下寫寫意意的宕來宕去，把剛剛趕到岸邊的獵人恨得牙癢癢地。</p>
<p>但是這一隻又大又紅的桃子，正懸在那顆樹枝上，那握着樹枝的猴子，想吃桃子，便反把拉着他兩個同伴的手一放，其餘兩隻猴子，便一齊跌倒在地，那自私的猴子却摘了桃子，大嚼起來，但其他兩隻猴子怎肯甘休，立刻一齊爬上去，扭作一團。</p>
<p>那獵人本來已經絕望不想渡河，這時見猴子們自相打架，便渡過河來。打開了專關猴子的籠子的門，靜靜地等候着，不久猴子們打得頭破了，疲乏了，一隻隻從樹上跌下，獵人毫不費力，一隻一隻捉進了籠子。</p>

<p>— 民</p>
<p>可甘，這走廊是一個很好的地方，我就常在那裏玩要的。這所在好像是屋子裏的一個陰凉可愛的花園。中央有一個金魚池，又有一株香蕉樹，上面長着一隻隻真的香蕉，沿邊又有各種仙人掌，接二連三的排列在那裏。我當然不能在青草上打滾，因爲地上都舖着棕色的瓦塊，並沒有青草的。我在走廊上玩要時，街上的人都瞧不見我，這是再好沒有的事。</p>
<p>可甘，你要知道，要是你做了電影明星，人家就往往要來瞧你模樣兒是長得怎麼樣的。他們還要和你親近，和你握手，拍拍你的頭，問你可有什麼感想，並且拿出紙片來，請你簽上一個名兒。有時還得突如其來的，伸出臂兒來抱住了你，和你接吻！</p>
<p>可甘，就爲了這個，我覺得在這關閉着的走廊上玩要，比了公開的花園裏好得多。我記得第一次得了自由車，玩得真有趣呢，哥哥傑克—他如今已二十一歲，身長六呎二吋了—他說這不是二輪自由車而是三輪自由車，因爲車上是有三個輪子的。那時我坐着這自由車，在我們老園子裏的小徑上打着旋子跑，高興得什麼似的。那些小徑都是狹狹的，恰容得下兩個平行的輪子，我要是跑得太快，就跌在媽媽的花壇裏，我是跌到旁邊的水溝去。</p>
<p>我雖不出園子一步，有一次却作了一個長距離的旅行。我把車兒踏到園子盡頭的有加利樹一帶，就算到了本雪文義洲的伊利鎮，這是爸爸小時節居住的所在。第二天我到了支加哥，這是媽媽的故鄉。你要知道爸爸和媽媽到加利福尼州來的時候，都是年青得很，他們在這裏遇見了，後來就在家裏結婚的。</p>
<p>可甘，我再要告知你，我們的老屋子是在聖亞馬尼加。這一個鎮，很鄰近貝佛來山和好萊塢的。你看上去時，只見屋子相接，街道相通，還當做是在一個鎮上；你要是能够分得清那一條街是頭，那一條街是尾，那你才算真的聰明哩。其實聖他馬尼加和貝佛來山好萊塢兩處有不同之點，因爲它最接近海灘，外面就是太平洋。</p>
<p>從我們的老屋子裏走出去，可以直達海灘，而我們從新屋子裏出去，也可以直達的。你要知道我們仍是住在聖他馬尼加，和從前住的地方相去不遠，不過環境有些不同罷了。要到海灘上去，坐了媽媽的新汽車去，再快也沒有，但我們已不大去了，因爲我在攝影塲中事情太忙之故。我倘不拍電影時，還得上學。咦，並不是真的上學堂去，不過在攝影塲上我的平屋裏由白克蘭小姐敎我讀書寫文章，這些情形容我以後再細細地告知你。</p>

<p>— 玉山</p>
<p>德國的目標</p>
<p>謠傳已久的德國進攻荷比的企圖，終於“德國陸軍空軍越過荷比的邊境，及德國海軍在海牙登陸，而成事實了。戰爭已由北歐而擴大至西歐。德國這次軍事行動，直接的對象，固爲荷比盧三國，而其間接的對象，當然是站在這些國家後面的協約國—英法。因爲德國通過了荷蘭比利時，攻　法國的側面，不但使法國的馬奇諾陣綫，失其效用，並且德國佔領了比利時荷蘭後，作爲空軍的根據地，使德國和英國的空軍距離更爲縮短，可以利用這些地帶來空襲英倫，及海峽中的英國商船，使英國海上的封鎖，可因上有飛機下有潛艇的威脅而受到打擊。英法對於德國的侵犯荷比中立，最所關心的也就在這一方面。</p>
<p>上次大戰中的敎訓</p>
<p>再說上次大戰的經騐看來。這次進攻的路綫，雖不同於旣往，但其欲趨比利時而下蘆森堡，似乎對於上次大戰中德國主力軍借這進攻的舊戰塲，並沒有忘情。在上次大戰中德國集中七個軍團於法國邊境，在魯柏拉赫脫親土及哈林根將軍指揮下的第六第七兩軍團，則集中於　脫拉斯堡，向莫塞河方面進攻。其他五個軍團則實行許里芬著名的迂迴戰略。借進比利時，包抆法國的側翼，以擊潰法軍。以德皇儲統制的第五軍，集中於脫里爾及薩爾伯魯根港，通過盧森堡，及法境的郞孚兩地，以一短距離的弧形綫，西南趨向法境的范爾登。在阿爾相雷赫公爵下的第四軍，則取更大的迂迥，通過盧森堡，而以法國境內的夏龍爲其目標。在霍森將軍統制下的第三軍及布雷將軍統制的第二軍，則通過比利時境內的利日及那木兒及墨恩等地與第一軍在法境內匯合，斷絕英法聯軍的匯合，而將法國軍隊，壓迫退至巴黎近郊，將之包圍，而達到速戰速決的目的。由於比利時的抵抗，時間上的延遲，及兵力上的還嫌單薄，顯露了第一軍的側翼，在二十六天以內打下了巴黎的計劃，沒有如願以償。</p>
<p>上次大戰的舊手法</p>
<p>這次大戰中，在法比邊境，顯然已有不同之點。法國正面，有馬奇諾陣綫的經營，其防禦工事的　固，固非昔比，而其接境的比利時邊境，也和法國有同樣的防禦工事，所以要從德國境內的安森，發動迂迴戰，侵入比境，再抄過去的舊文章，時過境遷，已有部分的不適用，不過從其進攻盧森堡上，還多少可以看出她仍玩上次大戰中的老手法。但在馬奇諾防綫中的法國軍隊，也必衝出戰壕，開入盧森堡境內，以爲盧國之助，西歐的壕塹戰，或且因此而吿一結束，變爲英法兩國在盧森堡境內與德對壘的大戰的序幕。</p>
<p>德國避强攻弱</p>
<p>德國對盧森堡進攻，或較在比利時容易得手。因爲比利時在國防建設上，都要比荷盧兩國强固得多。法國西綫有馬奇諾陳綫，比國西綫也有「小馬奇諾陣綫」。這陣綫　在法國工程師指導下而造成的。共北部安脫威城至利日一綫，還有一條新的亞爾培運河的開闢，這條運河有二百五十英大闊，十五英尺深，其主要的目的，是作爲軍事障礙物用的，沿河有機關槍網的密佈，及火力很猛的大砲的裝置。在軍事的防禦上，這次大戰中的比利時，與上次大戰中的，顯然有很大的差異。再就上次大戰中的情形講，德國許里芬戰略相當的成功，是德國出其不意，攻其無備的結果，比利時正如英法聯軍方面樣，沒有料到德國會破壞比利時的中立，迂迴至法國的側翼，而給法國一個打擊。而這次的比利時，一在戰爭開始，就動員川萬人，守護國境，與上次動員四萬二千人來與德軍作戰，相距眞小能以道里計，然而就是上次大戰中，比利時這樣少的軍隊，在百忙中應付强大的德國，也給德國不少的阻礙，予英法極大的便利。道次比利時有這樣充分的準備，及英法聯軍一旦等德國向比利時進攻，必迅速予以實力援助兩點看來，德國對於比利時的進攻，無論如何，必不能像進攻北歐那樣便立，所以在德國方面，避强就弱，對比利時的進攻，或不像上次大戰中有確切把握，而必須審省。</p>
<p>在這意義上，德軍目前進展的主要路綫，在南是盧森堡比較居於重要，在北，或者是荷蘭居主要地位。荷蘭在國防上，遠不着比利時的强固，並且在地位上，是首當德國之衝。就形勢上講，德國進攻荷蘭，比較比利時容易得多。在軍事德國固然要用壓力使荷蘭就範，在內政上，德國也要利用荷蘭的國社黨從內部叛變，以收到裏應外合之效，後者當然要看德國的軍事力量，是否能揷足於荷蘭境內爲動。</p>
<p>荷蘭的戰略</p>
<p>現在德國的進攻剛在發　，結果如何很難預測。按照荷蘭原來的國防計劃，是等到德國侵入時，與德國在東部作積極抵抗。荷蘭可動員六十五萬人，由陸軍中將　伯爾爲總司令。假使在戰爭上失利，唯一的策略，就是決許得海的堤，放海水進來，困擾德軍，而將東北部全境完全放業，退至洛脫丹，烏脫雷赫脫，阿姆斯脫頓這一三角形的地帶。一切通過地帶的道路及橋樑兩側，都佈置起坦克車阻礙物地雷及障礙物來。不過這一切是以前的計劃，如果德軍從海牙用海軍登岸，按個了西部海口這一消息，眞如德方宣傳，業已成功的話，海牙去荷蘭最後退守地帶，只有箭之遙，荷蘭以前的計劃，或者多少要受到阻礙。但英法的海軍，也必象對挪威一樣，强行在荷蘭登陸，以與德國作戰，或從比利時開來，以爲荷蘭的奧援。所以將來的戰塲，或在荷蘭的一隅，現在德國的進攻，不過是初步。英法德雙方正厲兵秣馬，以準備大戰，戰爭結局如何，這是遙遠將來的事，現在還不能作全面的推斷呢</p>

<p>其實我們泱泱古國，所謂古蹟，隨地皆有，作者爲紹興人，以紹興論，該地西南多山，漢塚幾乎每山都有好幾處，這是指已露出地面者說，共未露出地面者，當不勝計。八一三後，作者賦閒在鄉間，其時　般農民，大發漢塚，他們叫作「淘古墳」，原來上海有一批古玩商駐紥就地收買，這些腦筋簡單的農民，想求古物，發橫財，但所謂「橫財」者，亦不過幾十元而已。後來縣政府出示禁止，違者拘辦，他們大多數在夜裏幹。有一次，我與親戚爬山消遣，忽見大批短褐者，負鋤而逃，近視之，則古墓已開發過半，此因我們久居滬地，村人不識，以爲便衣警察也。</p>
<p>作者以其價錢不貴，也頗買得一點：無字的磚塊不值錢，有字的一毛錢二塊。所謂字，在磚之兩邊係年號及造磚者的姓名，我查了一查，知爲三國時代之物，現在我還能記得的，一是嘉平三年，一是鳳凰元年，嘉平是查着了，鳳凰卻查遍各書沒有，（讀者有知道的，甚盼指教）其他年號尚多，一時不能記起。（因物在鄉間）一墓中，有字的磚沒有幾塊，大部份是無字的。另外還有劍及陶器，劍當然銹得同枯草一般，陶器則頗多完整者，有面盆水盂動物人形等。這些東西，賣價便宜，並不是鄉人發掘的目的物，他們動手發掘的，最希望有一面銅鏡，銅鏡大小不一，我見過的幾面，大約四五寸直徑，銅是已變成黑了，像烏金似的，光可鑑人，後面則有突出的十二生肖</p>

<p>自從外匯聚縮以後，市塲上的各種物價，無不高漲幾成，國貨的價格，也隨着提高，這不能不說對於人們生活上一個重大的威脅。國貨漲價以後，也許有人要說，旣然號稱國貨，應與外匯無關了，與外匯有密切聯繫的舶來品，外匯緊縮，價格飛漲，這是必然之理，國貨爲甚麽要跟着漲價呢？這種說話似乎是有理由，其實不然。因爲我國重工業不發達，加之戰時運輸不便，生產品的原料，大部分是仰賴舶來品的供給，加以上海環境特殊，一切生產原動力的煤電更是隨着外匯變動而增價，生產的成本旣然隨着外匯的緊縮而增加，則國貨的漲價，亦勢所必然。更有人說，本月二日外匯發生變勸，三日國貨即提高售價，這未免有趁火打刦之嫌了。存着這種心理的人，我固然不能說沒有，但是商品的產銷是有聯帶關係的，今日售出一批貨品，同時就要買進一批原料，已經在市塲上出售的貨品，成本常然是沒有增加，但現在購進的原料旣然價格增加，爲避免　失起見，則對於目前存貨極高幾成價，也未始沒有理由。</p>
<p>國貨提高售價，在國貨工廠方面旣有不得已的苦衷，而在消費者方面說，也是增加具生活負担之一種。我們爲了生產者本身的利益着想，固不能絕對的不尤許國貨的漲價，但爲了消費者的利益着想，却不能不希望國貨生產者對於國貨的提高售價，應予以十二分的審與。因爲國貨隨着外匯緊縮而過分的提高售價，給予消費者最大的影響，增加其負担尙是小事，而使顧客將國貨與外貨同等看待、這一種印象是國貨發展的一大障礙。在煤貴電貴原料貴人工貴的情勢之下，國貨的提高售價，我們固然寄予相當的同情，但在開門七件無一不貴的今日，我們對於消費者的負担加重，生活維艱，更不能不予以密切的注　。我們要明瞭從事生產事業是一種「投資而不是「投機」。旣然是正當的投資，爲了維護投資的安全，爲了保持其正當的利益，在金融市塲發生劇變的時代，採取必要的措置，實米可厚非，所以此次國貨的漲價，我們不但不反對，且寄予相常的同情。但企業者顧全了本身投資的安全與正當的利益，同時也須顧全到消費者的　益，非有必要不宜增加消費者的負担，更不能利用時機以獲取更大的贏餘將投資事業成爲投機行爲。我們固深知在目前從事國貨生產事業者的困難，原料價格的上騰較之於成品價格的提高不知要超越幾許，漲價實出於不得已，爲了保全正常投資，爲了維護民族工業，爲了顧全大衆生活的痛苦，在這物價高漲的今日消費者應明瞭生產者的艱辛，生產者應明瞭消費者的苦痛。對於國貨的漲備應兼籌並顧。一家哭一路笑，固爲事實所不能一家笑，一路哭，亦爲事實所不許。時至今日，惟有了解與體諒，足以消弭一切誤會與糾紛。於此次國貨漲價聲中，記者亦願以「了解」與「體諒」兩點貢獻給國貨生產者與消費者。</p>

<p>— 金芝軒</p>
<p>家庭工業之在中國，與家庭工業之在別國不同；中國以農立　，在時之認爲家庭工業者均爲機械製造品打倒，近年來之家庭工業其尙足記述而稍可換取外匯者略舉如下：</p>
<p>蠶繭</p>
<p>草帽與草帽鞭</p>
<p>花邊與手織物刺繡品　毛巾與提花小件</p>
<p>錫箔與黃紙錢（多爲僑胞迷信用）</p>
<p>綫粉</p>
<p>古董式各種美術品</p>
<p>以上各種家庭工業之尙能存在，其最大原因還在於中國人貪便宜。但統率無人改良乏術，不但不能日益發達，且無時不在風雨飄搖之中，故氣息僅存。如欲求其發展須分改良與提創二方面進行：</p>
<p>第一種改良固有家庭工業以求出超</p>
<p>第二種　提創別種家庭工業以减入超</p>
<p>以工業落後之國家，進入工業國其人民須先受工業革命之痛苦，至旣成爲工業發達之國家，後復受資本勢力之壓迫，則家庭工業更變其面目。中國目前之家庭工業，雖未達强健地位，不過在一盲目自由競爭之階段，受居問人之操縱與剝削，其危險較少，一旦有一組織完全之合作社出見，產銷雙方之隔膜盡除，則利用原有社會之組織，與中華民族之特性，前途無限。</p>
<p>關於改良固有家庭工業當有下列各項要點：</p>
<p>硏究銷路與購買者之心理</p>
<p>統一度量衡而加以準確校核</p>
<p>劃一原料色彩與適當之加工</p>
<p>對外宣傳對內吿誡與敎育引導</p>
<p>研究與引用合理化之各項</p>
<p>法則</p>
<p>關於提倡別種家庭工業當有下列各項要點：</p>
<p>勸導家庭婦女勿曠廢光陰同時灌輸以生產上之常識</p>
<p>硏究分散與集合製造上之得失　改良</p>
<p>建設補助工廠以製造人工上所不能及之部份與集合整理製成品</p>

<h3 id="e1">Allied Forces Rush to Aid in Battle: German Forces in Belgium and the Netherlands Find Themselves in a Dilemma; Millions of Dutch and Belgian Troops Rise Up to Resist and Defend Their Countries, Destroying Bridges and Flooding Lowlands to Hinder Enemy Advance <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Amsterdam: The Supreme Commands of the Netherlands and Belgium announced today that the German blitzkrieg invasion of the neutral small countries has failed. One million defenders have placed the German war machine in a dilemma, and Allied reinforcements are rapidly advancing to aid in the battle. Yesterday, a thousand German aircraft carried out some terrible air raids in Western Europe. British and French fighter planes have joined the Dutch and Belgian air forces in engaging the German aircraft. 500,000 Dutch and Belgian troops each are putting up heroic resistance along the 225-mile line of canals, waterways, and flooded lowlands. British and French mechanized units "not to be underestimated" are also reported to be heading north from Belgium to engage in a life-or-death struggle with the Germans. Although the German side claims that the resistance forces in the flooded border area have already collapsed, the Dutch and Belgian Commands declare that the German army has been blocked at the border. (United Press dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>The Hague: The General Headquarters has just released a report stating that our troops are now fiercely resisting in the border areas of the IJssel and Maas (Meuse) river basins. Although the enemy's offensive is extremely fierce, it has been contained at the city of Tiel, and several armored cars and trains have been destroyed, rendering them unusable. In the Venlo area, bridges have been destroyed by our forces. In addition, during enemy aircraft bombing of our airfields, several paratrooper units landed in our country and have been rounded up by our troops. (Havas dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>Berlin: Official circles announced that German troops have crossed the southern tip of the Dutch salient and occupied Maastricht, and have crossed the Maas River at several points, seizing bridges on the Albert Canal. (Reuters dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>Paris: Military personnel here recently stated that the situation on the front line today involves only contact between outpost units, and formal warfare has not yet begun. This war may be an unprecedented great war in history. After the Dutch and Belgian troops destroyed bridges, roads, and railways along the border area, they gradually retreated to the main defense lines. British and French troops have also quickly moved out and entered Belgium. The German air force was very active last night but has decreased somewhat today. As far as the Netherlands is concerned, the country's troops have built solid positions from the confluence of the IJssel and Rhine rivers to the coast of the Zuiderzee and have breached dikes to flood the area. In addition, south of Arnhem, between Nijmegen and Limburg province, the Dutch troops have the natural defenses of the Maas River and other lakes and marshes to hold. Although the German army attempted to attack the Dutch positions south of Arnhem, it has not succeeded so far. In other places, they have not yet reached the Dutch defense line. In particular, a considerable number of German paratroopers have landed in the Netherlands and once occupied several airfields, but they have all been retaken by the Dutch army. As for Belgium, the German target does not seem to be in the northern part of the country, but rather on the border of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. After the German troops invaded from Luxembourg, they advanced rapidly, but French troops have already rushed to aid them. German outposts made contact with French troops at noon today, and the fighting became more intense in the afternoon, but the French troops were still able to hold their original positions. On the other hand, at the border between France and Germany, German troops launched a large-scale offensive against the Maginot Line this afternoon. The intensity of the attack was unprecedented since the start of the war. French outpost units have been ordered to retreat. According to military experts, the above-mentioned situations are only preparations for a major war, and the main forces of both sides will soon launch a large-scale war. (Havas dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>Rotterdam: Although German troops gained a foothold on the right bank of the Maas River yesterday, the Dutch army quickly stopped their advance. German troops once occupied a ruined building on the banks of the Maas River, the site of the former Maas Hotel, but soon were forced to retreat because the building was set on fire by artillery shells. Intense gun and artillery fire was heard near the Bourse train station near Blijdorp, but only Dutch soldiers and sailors were seen there, not Germans. The German attempt to cross the Maas River bridge was apparently blocked by the Dutch army on the railway. When the Maas River bridge was retaken by the Dutch army, at least forty German soldiers were found hiding under the bridge. Because of the many rivers and canals and bridges in the port, the Dutch army was able to rely on them to create defensive positions and repeatedly defeat German attempts to advance. (United Press dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>The Hague: According to a Dutch military headquarters communiqué, the front-line Dutch troops appear to be stopping the German advance along the entire line. Although small but highly effective, the Dutch Air Force has been continuously attacking German bombers and German troop concentrations since the start of the war. According to a Reuters correspondent, the morale of the Dutch army and other troops is very high. (Reuters dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>Brussels: There are no changes in the battle situation this morning. The Belgian side is still holding its "destruction line" far outside its main defense line. According to official announcements, the Belgian people firmly support the king and absolutely trust the courage and effectiveness of the Belgian army in resisting the enemy. (Reuters dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>Dutch Inland and West Coast: More German Troops Descend from the Sky</p>
<p>London: Dutch radio messages say that German aircraft have begun dropping troops by parachute in the Zeeland area on the west coast. Subsequently, an air force communiqué declared that German troops have also parachuted down in the southern Netherlands near the Belgian border. (Reuters dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>The Hague: Yesterday, many German soldiers parachuted into various inland areas, such as the areas near Moerdijk, Gouda, Baarle-Nassau, Tilburg, and the military airport near Princess Juliana's residence in Soesterberg, and twenty-five German soldiers landed in the Dordrecht area near Rotterdam. The Dutch people remain very calm. (Reuters dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>The Hague: Dutch troops in the rear spent the entire night yesterday searching for German soldiers who landed by parachute, and they are continuing today. Police, civilians, volunteers, and guards are all assisting in the search with rifles, bayonets, and pistols. (Reuters dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>Strong British and French Forces Advance to the Dutch and Belgian Borders Yesterday</p>
<p>Paris: The headquarters of the British and French armies in France released the following communiqué this morning from Paris: German aircraft used machine guns to strafe roads and transportation points, attempting to prevent Allied forces from advancing towards the Dutch border. The attacks began at midnight, but the Allied air force and anti-aircraft artillery escorting and protecting undefended towns or engineering works dealt a severe blow to them. The enemy intends to use airborne troops to advance along the line from the coast to the Moselle River, continuing to advance within Belgium, while in Luxembourg, German troops are taking the offensive in the area east of Sierck-les-Bains and the Moselle River and have made fierce contact with French troops. (Havas dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>Brussels: British and French motorized units are now rushing to the Port of Antwerp, the Albert Canal area, and the Scheldt city (between the Port of Antwerp and the city of Liège). In addition, German air fleets are reported to have bombed Aalst (northwest of Brussels), Renaix (west of Tournai), Louvain, and Verviers (east of Liège and near the border), causing heavy civilian casualties. Two air raid alerts have been issued in the capital. (Havas dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>Amsterdam: All railway bridges over major rivers in the Netherlands have been destroyed by the Dutch army, with the exception of one bridge over the IJssel River, which is currently being guarded by Dutch troops. Rumors here say that Dutch engineers have destroyed the radio station in Kootwijk to prevent it from falling into German hands. (Reuters dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>Brussels: A communiqué released here says that Belgian troops have made contact with the enemy, and there is fighting on the Albert Canal, the Meuse River, and at Arlon. (Reuters dispatch, 11th) Briefly, the Belgian and French people are not alarmed and are maintaining their calm. The speed and ferocity of the German advance have not shaken their confidence. Foreign observers believe that the German army has not invaded more than 13 miles into Belgian territory in any location. (Reuters dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>London: A Reuters correspondent accompanying the British Expeditionary Force says that the British and French armies have entered Belgium in response to Belgium's call for help. After the border barriers were removed this morning, the soldiers in full battle dress moved eastward in an orderly fashion. Tens of thousands of people along the road cheered and threw flowers, and ran after the army trucks to share beer with the soldiers. As they moved further away, the soldiers waved enthusiastically to say goodbye to the French people, and the people raised their thumbs to show their "congratulations and good luck." The German force's sudden attack was, of course, within the expectations of the Allied forces. When the British Expeditionary Force arrived at the Belgian border, the military appearance was very strong. Trucks, tanks, armored vehicles, cars, and motorcycles were continuously moving forward in an organized formation. The soldiers all showed a determined and happy spirit, ready for everything. Since the start of the war, the British army has been on standby for a long time, and now they are greatly excited psychologically by being called to war. They quickly set off under the clear blue sky to help their new ally. (Reuters dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>Paris: The General Headquarters released a war report stating that the British and French Allied forces immediately went to the aid of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg this morning and are on the North Sea...</p>
<p>Military Situation in Luxembourg: Under Control of Allied Forces</p>
<p>London: The military situation in Luxembourg is reportedly under the control of Allied forces. German troops are reported to have reached the outer defenses of Liège and have crossed the Albert Canal at Maastricht and are advancing rapidly towards Roermond. The main German advance appears to be north of the Rhine, with destinations being Almelo, Hengelo, and Enschede. Fighting is underway in that area. As far as is known, German troops have not advanced south from the Luxembourg border. Allied forces are now advancing according to plan. Yesterday's military operations can be considered quite satisfactory. British troops encountered bombing during their advance, but there were no major casualties. According to military personnel, the main feature of yesterday's military operations was aerial warfare. Land warfare does not appear to have expanded to the expected extent, and it is believed that Germany's blitzkrieg strategy has been shattered by the Dutch's quick destruction of the Maas River bridges.

<h3 id="e2">New Developments in the European War <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Early in the morning the day before yesterday, the German army finally launched its blitzkrieg strategy against the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg on the Western Front. Before commenting on the significant impact of this development, we should first review Germany's strategy. A country's external operational plans are often revised as times progress, but due to limitations of various objective environments, especially the constraints of geographical environment, there are also unchanging aspects. Germany's basic operational plan was set in 1898 by General Schlieffen, the Chief of the Army General Staff. Its main points were to regard the British and French Allied forces as the hypothetical enemy and French territory as the hypothetical battlefield, defending primarily on the left flank (the German-French border) and attacking primarily on the right flank, preparing to quickly pass large forces through the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg, directly threaten northern France, and defeat it. This German operational plan was put into practice in 1914, but because it did not fully consider Imperial Russia's offensive on the Eastern Front, the German military strategy was entirely shaken. Therefore, after the outbreak of the Second European War last year, Hitler temporarily adopted a defensive posture on the Western Front under the cover of the Siegfried Line, and placed great emphasis on conquering Poland to eliminate future worries. However, Hitler did not abandon the Schlieffen Plan. After the situation on the Eastern Front cleared up somewhat this spring, Germany focused all its efforts westward to compete with Britain and France. Moreover, Hitler further expanded the use of the Schlieffen Plan. The Schlieffen Plan only advocated forcefully passing through Belgium, Luxembourg, and because of opposition by General Moltke the Younger, Germany did not invade the Netherlands in the First European War; while now Hitler is invading the Netherlands at the same time as invading Belgium and Luxembourg, and a month before invading Belgium, Luxembourg, he invaded Denmark and southern Norway. The Schlieffen Plan only considered French territory as the hypothetical battlefield, while Hitler's forceful occupation of Denmark, Norway, and the Netherlands clearly shows that he wanted to establish naval and air force bases there as preparation for invading the British Isles.</p>
<p>Now, the British and French Allied forces have moved north to assist in the battle. It is still difficult to say how the future of the war will develop, but since Germany has launched this new attack, its momentum is naturally quite fierce, and its impact is extremely far-reaching. Objectively speaking, Germany's invasion of Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands has both advantages and disadvantages for Germany. Let's analyze it.</p>
<p>Strategically, if the German army can pass through Belgium and Luxembourg, it is naturally a major threat to the northern border of France. France's Maginot Line originally extended from the German-French border to the French-Belgian border, but it cannot be denied that the Maginot Line on the French-Belgian border was built later and has weaker equipment. Moreover, the German invasion of Belgium and the Netherlands is an even greater threat to Britain. Napoleon once said, "The port of Antwerp on the border between Belgium and the Netherlands is a pistol pointed at the heart of Britain." If Germany can occupy the Netherlands and Belgium, it can establish naval and air force bases to attack southern Britain, just as Germany can establish naval and air force bases in Norway to attack northern Britain. This is the first point in favor of Germany. Economically, Belgium and the Netherlands have very close business ties with Britain and France. In 193x, Belgium's international trade, both exports and imports, ranked first with France, with exports to Britain ranking second and imports ranking fifth. In the same year, the Netherlands' international trade was less with France, but exports to Britain ranked first and imports ranked fourth. If Germany can occupy Belgium and the Netherlands, it can not only actively obtain the resources of the two countries, but also passively inflict a heavy blow on Britain and France. This is the second point in favor of Germany.</p>
<p>However, war is only a continuation of politics. Germany's attack on Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands has its reasons from the war itself, but from a political or diplomatic perspective, it cannot be said to be without serious consequences. What Germany benefits from diplomatically now is Italy's cheering support and the neutrality of the Soviet Union and the United States, with the Soviet Union even providing some commercial assistance to Germany. However, Germany's headlong rush to attack Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands, if successful, will not be able to maintain the balance of power in Europe. Not only will the Soviet Union and Italy be uneasy, but the United States will also be threatened. Therefore, Germany's aggressive strategy has a significant possibility of producing the following consequences: (1) Promoting a renewed reconciliation between the Soviet Union and Britain and France; (2) Increasing Mussolini's hesitation to help Germany in the war; (3) And most importantly, American sympathy and assistance to Britain and France will increase dramatically due to Germany's invasion of Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands. In this way, Germany's international situation will become more isolated, and Germany's diplomatic status will be further weakened, which will inevitably have an unfavorable impact on Germany's military.</p>
<p>With the new developments in the European war, the British cabinet has been reorganized, with the highly respected Mr. Churchill succeeding as Prime Minister and expanding the cabinet's lineup to strengthen its power. Britain is a great power with greater international responsibilities. Although Britain has been committed to peace in the past decade, its ambiguous attitude and slow action are regrettable. Aggressive countries are like wildfires. East and West echo each other, and the situation is interconnected. It is necessary to quickly seize the opportunity to eliminate the great disaster. Recently, the Soviet Union has made a proposal to resume negotiations with Britain, and the United States has expressed its active opposition to aggression. The British authorities should cherish this fleeting opportunity to participate in organizing a broad anti-aggression front that covers Europe, Asia, and the Americas. Then, the new developments in the European war will have more positive significance.</p>
<p>Clouds like white dogs. The state of the world is impermanent. Moreover, people's hearts are becoming more dangerous day by day. The cost of living is increasing. It is not easy for us to establish ourselves in the world. If we can know our fate and determine our direction, and distinguish between good and evil people, then it will not be difficult to achieve beauty for both ourselves and others. This is truly an aid to self-cultivation.</p>
<p>Those who take risks and seek luck in the world mostly indulge in the notion of fortune. As they gradually become more involved in the world, their plans often go wrong. They begin to realize that the control of fate is beyond human power. Shen Youzhi of the Southern History once said, "If I had known that poverty and success were destined, I regret not studying for ten years." This is truly a statement of experience. I am now seeking to have everyone know their fate and each abide by their duty. Then, there will be no disaster of war above and no fear of plunder below. Society can then be peaceful.</p>
<p>Although fate is a small path, its principles are profound. I often see those who study this path and discuss it for years, but still cannot enter the hall. Their words are rarely accurate. This is because they lack practical experience. Now, academic theory and practical experience are applied seamlessly. Whether you are already studying or have not yet studied, you will all gain a shortcut to success. Moreover, the subjects taught are all practical. After completing the study, you can not only calculate for yourself, but also weigh things for others. Those who lack communication skills can also...</p>
<h3 id="e3">German Air Force Extremely Active Over Capitals of Belgium and the Netherlands <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>London: The Brussels radio station issued warnings several times this morning, indicating that German aircraft are still active over Belgium. First, a squadron of nine Junkers aircraft was seen, followed by two groups of Messerschmitt aircraft, one with ten and the other with twenty-one. Later, twenty-one Dornier aircraft were seen over a certain city in Belgium. (Reuters dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>Brussels: Air raid alerts were issued twice in the city this morning at 5:00 AM and 7:00 AM as German aircraft flew low over the city. Anti-aircraft fire was quite intense. British expatriates in Brussels have received notices today to immediately leave the country and return to Britain.

However, hundreds of Dutch soldiers, after sounding the alarm, armed themselves and drove in fast cars to the outskirts of Valkenburg, engaging the enemy. It is believed that many enemy soldiers were killed. According to the reporter's observation, the Dutch mobile defense force responded effectively to this new type of blitzkrieg strategy.

<p>Amsterdam: Water is an important part of the Dutch national defense plan. German troops invading must first pass through countless dikes, carving a bloody path before reaching the flooded areas. Along the border, there are many flooded areas and well-positioned guard posts, which form the first line of defense. One of the strongest points on this line is Nijmegen, which protects all routes through the narrowest part of central Holland, and all routes along the IJssel River have strong defenses. Behind this line is a semi-circular defense line, connected to the Zuiderzee and the Meuse River estuary, with dams and canals intertwined. When the water rises, the land disappears, and only the treetops and uninhabited villages are visible. Behind the aforementioned sea defense line, there is also a large-scale defensive fortification line, and the hills where machine gun nests are placed are also important for national defense.

<p>Fancheng: The magnificent annihilation battle on the Henan-Hubei border has continued to develop around the Zhaoyang area since yesterday afternoon. Following the achievements of the all-out offensive launched by the Chinese army across the entire line on the afternoon of the 10th, the Chinese army continued to display its power, and after flattening the Japanese first-line positions, launched a fierce attack on the Japanese second and third-line positions. At dawn today, the circular Japanese second-line position was completely breached. Most of the Japanese troops stubbornly resisting in this position abandoned their weapons, took off their uniforms, and fled into civilian houses, looting civilian clothes and food, and forcibly dragging villagers to guide them, attempting to escape in groups of three or five. After being captured by the Chinese army, they were all properly accommodated and given food. About a thousand Japanese cavalry artillerymen who burned and killed in the Lutou Town northeast of Zhaoyang were also wiped out by the Chinese army, with no one escaping the net. This afternoon, the Chinese army fought bravely in hand-to-hand combat and rushed towards the Japanese final line of defense. The remaining Japanese troops scrambled to find ways to escape. The Chinese army is now fiercely converging to annihilate the remaining Japanese troops. At the same time, the Chinese army in southern Henan is developing in all directions from the Pinghan Railway and the Nanxin and Nanque highways, sweeping away the remaining Japanese troops everywhere, capturing more than ten important strongholds such as Wushengguan in succession, making particularly rapid progress, and achieving extremely great gains. According to statistics reported from the battlefield, from the night of the 9th to the afternoon of today, more than 15,000 Japanese troops have been annihilated in various places. The Chinese army also seized 131 Japanese military vehicles, more than 1,500 horses and packhorses, countless weapons and ammunition, and various military supplies. (11th)</p>
<p>Fancheng: After the Chinese army recaptured Liulin Station on the 8th, they took the opportunity to expand their achievements and immediately captured strongholds in the Liulin Town, Lijiaji, and Jigongshan areas one after another. The railways near each of these places were completely destroyed. Another unit of the Chinese army advanced to the vicinity of Wushengguan and engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese. The railways and tunnels north and south of Wushengguan have all been destroyed by the Chinese army. The main transportation routes are now in the hands of the Chinese army. (11th)</p>
<p>Fancheng: After the Chinese army recaptured Minggang, they pursued the retreating Japanese troops. The Japanese retreated to the northwestern region of Xinyang, attempting to block the Chinese advance. The Chinese launched a fierce attack, engaging in a bloody battle in the Xingji and Wanggang areas, fighting for two days and nights, annihilating more than 3,000 Japanese troops. The remaining Japanese troops fled to Xinyang. (11th)</p>
<p>Fancheng: After Tanghe and Biyang were recaptured by the Chinese army in succession, they swept away the remaining Japanese troops in the vicinity for days, capturing many.

The Japanese troops who invaded Shuanggou were annihilated by more than half by the Chinese army last night, and the remaining Japanese troops fled. Shuanggou was also recaptured. (11th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: The news of the great victory of the Chinese army in the area east of Xiangfan is flying in like snowflakes from the front lines of northern Hubei and southern Henan, so the news from Europe, although very important, has paled in comparison. According to battle reports from the front lines, when the Japanese army divided into four routes to encircle Xiangyang at the beginning of this campaign, the Chinese army commander concealed the Chinese army's movements in a skillful way. When the Japanese troops from each route met in the eastern part of Xiangyang, they still did not know where the main force of the Chinese army was located. Then the two wings of the Chinese army suddenly surrounded the Japanese army. At midnight on Thursday, the Chinese army began a general counterattack in a thunderstorm. The Japanese troops from Xinyang and Zhongxiang who attacked Xinye were defeated by the Chinese army west of Zhaoyang. Biyang was recaptured by the Chinese army yesterday morning. The main force of the Japanese army was heavily surrounded by the Chinese army near Zhaoyang. On Thursday, the heavy rain provided valuable assistance to the Chinese army, because the bad weather prevented Japanese aircraft from moving. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<p>Fancheng: Here is a summary of the good news from the Chinese side regarding the second major battle in southern Henan, northern Hubei, and central Hubei: (1) The Japanese troops who attacked Tanghe from Xinyang were attacked from both the left and right flanks by the Chinese army, abandoning more than 1,300 corpses and retreating. They once advanced to the vicinity of Xinye, attempting to join up with the Japanese troops advancing north from Zhongxiang. After the Chinese army launched a fierce attack on the Japanese troops from the front and rear, they retreated to the southeast. (2) The Japanese troops advancing north from Zhongxiang were followed by a unit of the Chinese army in central Hubei, who completely cut off their rear transportation routes while simultaneously pursuing and severely attacking them. On the 9th, along with the Japanese troops defeated near Xinye by the Chinese army, they scattered and fled to the southeast. They were once again intercepted and severely attacked by the Chinese army in the Huanglongdang area west of Zhaoyang and northeast of Fancheng, killing more than 13,000 Japanese troops. (3) In the Biyang area, the Chinese army flanked the Japanese troops from the northwest and two wings on the 10th. The Japanese troops were unable to resist and retreated towards Xinyang. (4) After the start of the battle, the Chinese army also seized the opportunity to launch a fierce attack on the Japanese troops in the area east and northeast of Xinyang, while simultaneously recapturing Liulin Station on the Pinghan Railway and destroying the railway from Xinyang to Wushengguan, completely cutting off the Japanese retreat route. (5) The Chinese army on the Hanyi and Jingzhong routes continues to advance. (10th)</p>
<p>Yichang: The Chinese army in central Hubei continues to attack the Japanese troops entrenched in Qianjiang, Xiantao, and Tianmen, making considerable progress in recent days. The Chinese army is also using strong units on the Hanyi Road to tail the Japanese troops advancing north. On the Jingzhong Road, the Japanese retreat route has been cut off by the Chinese army. The Japanese troops surrounded by the Chinese army in the area north of Zhongxiang have been annihilated by the Chinese army in separate battles, capturing a large number of spoils. (10th)</p>
<p>Fancheng: After ten days of bloody fighting in the Henan-Hubei-Central Hubei battle, the Chinese army won a great victory, and the Japanese have been completely defeated. The Japanese troops in Biyang attempted to retreat to Xinyang, but the Chinese army is currently encircling and annihilating them. The Japanese troops near Xinye retreated to Zhaoyang, but have been intercepted and pursued by the Chinese army from the front and rear and are now in a heavy encirclement. At present, the Chinese armies from all routes are launching a very satisfactory joint attack. (10th)</p>

Fierce fighting is currently underway. (11th)</p>
<p>Tongguan: The Japanese troops near Jincheng and Gaoping in southern Shanxi were encircled by the Chinese army on the 5th, 6th, and 7th, suffering extremely heavy losses.

Along the way, they were intercepted and killed by Chinese pursuit troops, annihilating countless Japanese troops and destroying Japanese vehicles. (11th)</p>

<p>Washington: President Roosevelt worked through the night the night before last and met with his cabinet again yesterday morning, severely criticizing Germany's invasion of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg. People in the capital are now saying that Congress will continue to meet during the European war. President Roosevelt also held talks with the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Chief of Staff, and the leaders of the Army and Navy to explore the issue of neutrality. Senator Pittman, the chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said that Germany's invasion of Belgium and the Netherlands is another demonstration of totalitarian countries being unrestrained by reason and humanity. (Associated Press, 11th)</p>
<p>Washington: Germany's invasion of the Netherlands has made a deep impression in the United States. This is not only related to general moral issues, but also in personal emotions. Many prominent Americans, such as President Roosevelt and Senator Vandenberg, who are of Dutch descent, have been greatly affected. Therefore, observers are gradually feeling that the United States will not be able to remain outside for long. President Roosevelt told reporters last night that the situation speaks for itself and that he deeply sympathizes with the Queen of the Netherlands' proclamation. As for the possible impact of Germany's invasion of the Netherlands on the United States, many events are currently being studied. He has not seen any changes in the possibility of the United States remaining outside. After receiving news of German aircraft bombing civilians, the United States is now considering the rumors spread by Germany during the war that it would not bomb undefended towns. When asked whether the restrictions on war zones under the Neutrality Act would be extended to the Dutch East and West Indies, the President replied that he did not intend to make any changes at present.

<p>Washington: The Chiefs of Staff of the US Army and Navy and government officials met with President Roosevelt at the White House today. It is believed that what they discussed was the plan to protect the United States from being dragged into the European war. When government officials arrived at the White House, many looked as if they had not slept well. Today, fewer citizens are working here and are gathered around loudspeakers listening to the latest war reports. Officials are now in close contact regarding events in the Far East and the Dutch East Indies. Many people say that President Roosevelt is personally responsible for the decision to keep the fleet stationed in Hawaii. (Reuters, 10th)</p>

<p>Manila: Germany's invasion of the Netherlands has aroused concentrated interest here today regarding the US attitude towards the Dutch East Indies. The "Manila Bulletin" said that it is time for the United States to adopt a tough policy in the Far East. The American flag hung here is enough to make the United States' responsibility to the Philippines no less than that of Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington. If this responsibility cannot be recognized, then its error is as serious as that committed by European countries in failing to use the power of public law and order to curb the war of aggression. Reports of the movement of the US fleet in Hawaii have led to rumors of whether the United States is strengthening its defenses in the Far East. However, the highest authorities of the US Navy here strongly deny this news. Well-informed sources believe that the purpose of US High Commissioner to the Philippines Sayre's recent visit to Tokyo was to clarify to Japan the United States' determination not to ignore changes in the status quo of the Dutch East Indies.

<p>Tokyo: The Japanese Cabinet held a special meeting today to discuss the European situation, which lasted for three hours. It was decided to notify all countries, declaring Japan's determination to maintain the status quo of the Dutch East Indies. Foreign Minister Arita has been ordered to inform all countries that Japan is absolutely concerned about any serious situation accompanying the European war that may affect the status quo of the Dutch East Indies, and must pay attention to the statement issued by Japanese Foreign Minister Arita on April 15 regarding maintaining the status quo of the Dutch East Indies. Foreign Minister Arita summoned diplomatic representatives of European belligerent countries, as well as representatives from the US and Italy, tonight to inform them of the Japanese government's deep concern over the possibility of the war expanding to the Dutch East Indies.

<p>Tokyo: Foreign Ministry officials said today that they do not hope that Britain or the United States will intervene in the Dutch East Indies because of Germany's invasion of the Netherlands. Currently, Japanese authorities are closely monitoring the development of the situation. (Associated Press, 11th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: The general reaction of Japanese newspapers to the German invasion of the Netherlands and Belgium can be seen from the "Hochi Shimbun." The newspaper said that the impact of Germany's new aggression on Japan depends on the following points: (1) The attitude of Britain, France, and the United States towards the Dutch East Indies. There is a risk of war spreading to the Pacific, which depends solely on the attitude of the United States. (2) Whether the United States will extend its hand to the Dutch East Indies. If so, it will become a truly serious problem. (3) Britain may propose that the Allied countries, the United States, and Japan jointly manage the Dutch East Indies. (4) The Allied countries need to concentrate all their strength in Europe.

<p>Washington: The US Navy yesterday quickly moved to defend the Dutch West Indies, but is only monitoring the East Indies. Admiral Stark, Chief of Naval Operations, met with President Roosevelt yesterday morning. After leaving, he denied rumors that the US fleet would sail from Hawaii to Manila. He told reporters, "There are no changes to the fleet's plans." Admiral Stark stated that protecting the West Indies does not require other special orders, as the Atlantic Neutrality Patrol is currently defending Curaçao, St. Martin, Aruba, and Bonaire. Aruba and Bonaire have been important locations for oil refining since patrols began last fall. The Dutch Navy has two destroyers, several submarines, and other light warships in the West Indies, but it is not an enemy of a German pocket battleship. Secretary of State Hull told reporters yesterday morning that he hopes Pan-American leaders will soon review the impact of the new European battle situation on the West Indies. Leaders of Congress said that they are considering revising the entire national defense program to adapt to the currently expanding European battle situation. It is believed that both the Army and Navy will request increased military spending for the construction of new naval forces. Senator Thomas, Chairman of the Senate Army Budget Subcommittee, said that he believes the committee will meet with President Roosevelt on Monday. (Associated Press, 11th)</p>
<p>Washington: Secretary of State Hull indicated last night that he will consult with South American republics on the status of the Dutch territories in the Western Hemisphere, and said that no efforts were made to make any decisions regarding the Dutch East Indies when consulting with the Dutch ambassador to the United States. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<p>Washington: Secretary of State Hull held talks with Dutch Minister to the United States Lou Ton today. When answering a reporter's question, he said, "What I discussed with Minister Lou Ton was the situation of the Dutch East Indies, Dutch Guiana in the Americas, and the Dutch island of Curaçao after Germany's invasion of the Netherlands. It is not true that the US government sent a note to the Japanese government on the Dutch East Indies issue." (Havas, 10th)</p>
<p>Willemstad: A state of martial law has now been declared throughout the Dutch island of Curaçao in the West Indies, because Curaçao is part of the Netherlands and is now at war with Germany. However, its international and political status has not changed. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<p>Washington: The Dutch Legation in the United States issued a message this afternoon stating that all territories of the Netherlands in the Western Hemisphere, namely Dutch Guiana and the island of Curaçao, have declared war on Germany. (Havas, 10th)</p>

<p>Washington D.C. Recent developments in the war situation have produced signs that the U.S.'s defense preparations will be accelerated. Many congressmen are inclined not to spare expenses, and President Roosevelt intends to ask Congress to immediately expand the army and navy. He also plans to re-submit the War Department's proposal to establish reserves of ordnance and supplies. It is estimated that these two projects will require a total of 500 million U.S. dollars, or perhaps even more. Adding to this the military expenses that have already been allocated or are about to be allocated, the defense expenditure for the fiscal year beginning July 1st will total around 2.267 billion U.S. dollars. At the same time, there is a chorus of voices in the House of Representatives demanding the immediate strengthening of U.S. defenses, in light of developments overseas. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<p>Washington D.C. It is reported that the U.S. War Department intends to recommend to President Roosevelt that Congress immediately allocate funds to build 200 long-range bombers to strengthen the defense line of the Western Hemisphere. These bombers will be part of the 6,000 military aircraft approved by Congress last year, costing 40,000 U.S. dollars each. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<p>Washington D.C. Members of the U.S. Congress unanimously demand the strengthening of national defense. Democratic Senator Thomas even declared that the U.S. must take effective measures to strengthen its defenses "as if the U.S. has already joined the war." (Havas, 10th)</p>
<p>Washington D.C. Senator Glass stated in the Senate this morning that Germans should be eradicated from the Earth.

<p>Manila. Suma, a spokesman for the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told a Tokyo-based reporter for the "Manila Newspaper" yesterday that the United States should grant the Philippines diplomatic rights, allowing it to participate in world affairs. Japan-Philippines relations are not yet on the table, but once the Philippines gains independence, Japan and the Philippines can conclude treaties on trade, culture, and non-aggression. Geographically, ethnically, and culturally, Japan and the Philippines are closer than any other Asian nation to Western nations. Both countries should be prepared to jointly respond to all important future events. Japan's policy towards the Philippines will be based on recognizing Philippine nationalism and is willing to see the Philippines gain independence and freedom. Even if it cannot be achieved very early, it is hoped that the independence of the Philippines will be seen in 1946. The new immigration law does not affect Japan-Philippines relations.

<p>Rome. Undersecretary of the Navy, Admiral Gabbaniari, recently reported to the Senate on the navy's shipbuilding program as follows: (1) The new fourth 35,000-ton battleship "Roma" will be launched in June of this year. (2) Twelve 3,700-ton cruisers are under construction and, upon completion, will be divided into two groups to serve in the fleet. (3) A number of submarines are under construction and will be completed soon. (4) Additional submarines and torpedo boats will soon be started. In addition, the various international conventions on which the rules of war are based are ultimately imperfect, so that certain countries often act arbitrarily and disregard the interests of non-belligerent countries. The current blockade measures of Britain and France have caused serious disruption to international maritime traffic, especially for countries along the Mediterranean coast, and especially for our country, which bears the brunt. In short, Italy's geographical, strategic, or economic position in the Mediterranean is contrary to the natural interests of the nation and must be changed. Fortunately, our fleet is strong enough to cope with any eventuality. (Havas, 11th)</p>

<h3 id="e25">Three Independent Nations Invaded: American People Shocked and Enraged; Roosevelt Addresses American Science Congress; Must Recreate World in the Ashes of War <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>Washington D.C. President Roosevelt, addressing the Science Congress last night, said that news of the German invasion of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg has "shocked and angered" the American people. The President declared, "The men and women who are here tonight are all feeling depressed. Over the past three years, we have witnessed various major changes. Each major event has dealt a major blow to our hopes for developing modern culture through peaceful means. Today, three more independent countries have been invaded by force. In terms of human affairs, everyone's mind will become accustomed to extraordinary actions if they occur frequently. But this is not the case with what is happening in the world today. I am pleased to hear that people expressed shock and anger at the bad news from the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg. Most people in the world abhor conquest, war, and bloodshed. People all over the world pray that neighbors do not invade neighbors. In recent years, people all over the world have heard of aggressor countries carrying out threats and then attacking other countries, again and again. Therefore, we can conclude that the continuation of such methods of force is a provocation to the daily civilization of us American people. We and most people in the world believe in constructive civilization rather than destructive civilization. We use various synonymous terms to represent constructive civilization, such as personal freedom, civil liberties, etc. We feel that we are conquering diseases, poverty, and suffering to build human progress. We are improving science and culture, gradually eliminating the barbarity, rudeness, and savagery of the unevolved era. Conversely, in another part of the world, teachers and scholars do not explore the truth, fearing that once they find the truth, it will not be suitable for the plans of the rulers. Teachers and scholars are often forbidden to teach the truth they know because the truth will set people free. Teachers and scholars become suspicious targets if they publicly speak or show interest in new truths because their tongues and brains must be mobilized for other purposes. Fortunately, these things have not been found in the New World. May God not allow this to happen in the New World. At the Panama Conference, in the capital of Brazil, and in the capital of Peru, we discussed the possibility of unpleasant events occurring. We deeply fear that destroyers may want to drag other continents into the vortex as well, and that the American countries may then take on the role of defenders of Western civilization and protectors of Christian civilization. At that time, this was just a deep concern. Today, that deep concern has become a reality. The heritage that we hope to share with all countries in the world is currently largely in our custody. Our only responsibility is to protect that heritage and enrich it. We must preserve the heritage for the world and recreate the world in the ashes of the current war. We have learned that until recently, most people in the American republics still believed that even though aggression was occurring everywhere, they could stay out of it. But in terms of the actions of armies, cannons, planes, and bombs, every acre of America is closer to modern aggressor countries than to those who sought to dominate the world centuries ago."

<p>London. The British Air Force Headquarters also announced that British aircraft were active over the Western Front today, conducting reconnaissance in various places, with a wider range than before. A squadron of bombers attacked enemy troops over the front line, and a squadron of fighters encountered a group of enemy bombers, immediately engaging and destroying many enemy aircraft. Although some British airfields were bombed by enemy aircraft, the material damage was minimal, and there were no casualties. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<p>London. At dawn today, groups of German aircraft flew to British air force bases in France to bomb them. The enemy aircraft types included Dornier 17s and 215s, Heinkel 111s, and Junkers 88s. British Air Force Hurricane fighters and French fighters engaged the enemy aircraft between 5:00 PM and 6:00 PM. Although the enemy aircraft were greater in number than the Allied forces, the British and French aircraft did not show weakness. The battle resulted in five Dornier aircraft being shot down and four destroyed. Another Heinkel aircraft was forced to land, and all personnel on board were captured. In addition, a squadron of British Hurricane fighters engaged enemy aircraft three times separately, shooting down three enemy aircraft in succession. French aircraft also shot down six enemy aircraft separately in the morning. (Havas, 10th)</p>

<h3 id="e28">German Official Issues Statement to Belgium and the Netherlands; Accuses Them of Measures Contradictory to Neutrality <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>Berlin. The German High Command, on May 4, 1940, drafted the following report on Belgium for the German government:</p>
<p>"In October 1936, the King of Belgium declared that Belgium would avoid concluding alliances with any foreign countries in the future and would adopt an independent policy. Therefore, all military preparations were not only against Germany but also against Britain and France. This was guaranteed. However, in fact, the following eleven points are worth mentioning:</p>
<p>(1) Belgium's defenses are entirely one-sided against Germany. Since the Great War, the Liege fortress has become the base of the strongest defensive works in Western Europe, and the defenses of Namur have also been greatly enhanced. Conversely, there are no fortifications at all where France and Belgium border each other. In the summer of 1937, Belgian Chief of Staff, General Bergen, gave a speech stating that Belgium's defense system was still oriented towards the east. This confirms Belgium's single-minded defense against Germany. On March 2, 1938, Belgian Minister of Defense, General Tenisse, declared in the Lower House that Belgium would maintain the freedom to implement its defense plans and freely consult or cooperate with foreign countries. This is an acknowledgement of Belgium's cooperation with Britain and France in national defense. In the 1939 budget, Belgium had a defense expenditure of 1 million francs to defend the south, and an additional 270,000,000 francs was allocated to enhance the already impregnable defenses of the eastern border. However, according to reports from German reconnaissance aircraft flying over France, there are absolutely no defensive fortifications on the Franco-Belgian border. On February 8, 1940, Belgian parliamentarian Cramans and Minister of Defense Tenisse engaged in a heated debate in the Lower House, confirming the lack of defense on the Franco-Belgian border. Even Belgian parliamentarians expressed dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>(2) In January 1939, General Tous, Inspector General of the French Reserve Officer Training Corps, inspected the French Reserve Officer School in Beijing. The Belgian Minister of Defense participated in the ceremony and dinner. This act is clearly contrary to the purpose of the Belgian king's independent policy.</p>
<p>(3) Belgian and British/French military representatives frequently exchanged visits, but never adopted a neutral attitude towards the German military. Anti-German paintings are hung on military buildings.</p>
<p>(4) According to documents seized by the Second Bureau of the Polish General Staff, the general staffs of Poland and Belgium exchanged documents regarding Germany. Among them was a letter from Colonel Feda, military attaché of the Polish embassy in France, to the head of the Second Bureau of the Polish General Staff, dated May 7, 1937, which proves that on May 1, 1937, the Polish military attaché in France signed an agreement with the Belgian General Staff, stipulating that the Belgian General Staff, with the permission of the Minister of Defense, would cooperate with the Second Bureau of the Polish General Staff to exchange information about the German military, maintaining absolute secrecy. The exchanged information was transmitted by the Polish military attaché in Belgium.</p>
<p>(5) The deployment of Belgian troops is completely one-sided against Germany. Since the end of September 1939, most of the Belgian troops have been concentrated on the northeastern border. In the second half of October, fourteen of Belgium's twenty-one divisions were transferred to the northeast, and three divisions were stationed near Beijing. On the night of November 7, it was announced that no leave was allowed in the military. At the same time, British and French troops gathered on the Belgian border. Belgium not only did not take precautions, but also issued an explicit order on January 14 of this year, forbidding Belgian soldiers to fire on French troops.</p>
<p>(6) Other technical measures are also specifically aimed at Germany, such as increasing military obstacles on the German-Belgian road, while removing those between France and Belgium. The evacuation of residents is also limited to the east, and they are moved to the Franco-Belgian border instead.</p>
<p>(7) Since October 1939, Belgium has been preparing to help Britain and France, allowing Allied troops to pass through Belgian territory when necessary. On November 11, 1939, the police on the Belgian-French border received orders to clear the roads in preparation for the entry of the Allied forces. All vehicles were gathered for use. On December 2, 1939, the mayor of Ardennes was ordered to prepare campsites for the French army. French military engineers supervised Belgian workers to build defenses, while British engineers supervised the construction of heavy artillery batteries. On April 20, 1940, a British ship loaded with British military supplies arrived in Antwerp, showing that since last October, Belgium has decided to support Britain and France. The task undertaken by the Belgian army is to intercept the German army and probe into the Ruhr area.</p>
<p>(8) The results of troop movements and air force reconnaissance by Britain and France prove that the left wing of the Allied forces has decided to attack Germany via Belgium. All mechanized infantry and tank units have gathered on the Belgian border.</p>
<p>(9) In terms of air force, Britain, France, and Belgium cooperate closely, providing equipment and helping in manufacturing. British and French aircraft have repeatedly violated Belgian airspace, and the Belgian government has turned a blind eye.</p>
<p>(10) Belgium also favors Britain and France in naval matters. Belgium originally stipulated that all foreign ships entering Antwerp must remove more than 300 kilograms of explosives from the ship, but this law is not enforced for British armed merchant ships.</p>
<p>(11) The most important thing is that recent reports indicate that Britain has not only been prepared to pass through Belgium for a long time, but has even occupied several airfields in Belgium under the cover of the Belgian Air Force. Based on the above points, it is fully proved that the Allied attack on Belgium is imminent. (Haitong, 11th)</p>

<p>London. An official announcement was issued from Number 10 Downing Street stating that Chamberlain has resigned from the position of Prime Minister, and Secretary of the Admiralty Churchill has accepted the King's invitation and succeeded as Prime Minister. Churchill hopes that all cabinet members will temporarily remain in their original positions to handle matters while the new government is being formed. The King received Chamberlain at Buckingham Palace yesterday afternoon for five minutes, after which Chamberlain left the palace. A Reuters parliamentary reporter stated that, judging from all indications, Churchill will immediately begin to form a wartime cabinet, while other new appointments will be postponed for the time being. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<p>London. Chamberlain convened all cabinet members for a cabinet meeting this afternoon, announcing his decision to resign and expressing gratitude to his colleagues, especially Secretary of the Admiralty Churchill. Afterwards, Chamberlain went to Buckingham Palace to submit his resignation to the King. The Prime Minister has been working diligently and tirelessly for the past week, appearing mentally and physically exhausted and pale. The general public gathered near the Prime Minister's residence on Downing Street, not dispersing all day. There were three meetings of the cabinet war committee, the first at 8:00 AM, with the chiefs of staff of the army, navy, and air force also present; the second at 11:30 AM; and the third in the afternoon. Immediately after, a full cabinet meeting was held, with the chiefs of staff of the army, navy, and air force also in attendance. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<p>London. A Reuters parliamentary reporter learned that the new Prime Minister Churchill is expected to complete the formation of his wartime cabinet by the end of this week or tomorrow. This major institution will become a command center, while the political heads of the navy, army, and air force will not be included. Churchill's intentions are currently unknown, but it is widely believed that Labor Party members Atlee, Greenwood, and prominent trade union leader Bevin, as well as former Labor government cabinet member Alexander, will join the new government. Greenwood and Bevin, in particular, are expected to join the war cabinet. The Liberal Party naturally expects its leader Sinclair to participate, and Lloyd George, who served as Prime Minister during the last Great War, is naturally one of the figures being looked to in the current tense situation. It is widely speculated that the ministers of the army, air force, and supply departments will all be replaced. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<p>London. After Churchill was promoted to Prime Minister, he met with former Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax at noon. It is generally expected that Chamberlain's appointment as Chancellor of the Exchequer, although opposed by some, will almost certainly materialize. (Havas, 11th)</p>
<p>London. It is believed in leading circles that opposition Labor Party leader Major Atlee, Morrison, and other members of parliament, as well as Liberal Party leader Sinclair, are all likely to join the new cabinet. Well-informed sources say that Chamberlain may serve as Chancellor of the Exchequer in the new cabinet, as he was in charge of the Treasury for five years before Sir Simon, and should be able to handle it with ease. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<p>London. The Labor Party Executive Committee issued a statement after a meeting in Bournemouth yesterday, stating that the Labor Party National Executive Committee unanimously resolved to participate in the new government led by the new Prime Minister, who has the confidence of the nation, and to assume responsibility. After this resolution was agreed upon, Labor Party leaders Atlee and Greenwood returned to London to go to Downing Street. (Reuters, 11th)</p>

<p>London – Chamberlain delivered a radio address last night, informing the nation, stating: "Hitler, this morning, without warning or reason, suddenly attacked Holland, Belgium, and Luxembourg, adding another appalling crime to his already tarnished reputation. Throughout history, no one has been more responsible for human suffering than Hitler. He chose this moment to act, believing that Britain is currently embroiled in political turmoil, with divided opinions and unable to unite. If Hitler believes that our internal conflicts benefit him, he misjudges the British people's psychology. I do not wish to criticize the debates in the House of Commons on Tuesday and Wednesday, but after the debates concluded, I deeply realized that to restore the House's confidence and wage the war with the necessary vigor for victory, new and drastic actions were essential. What are these new and drastic actions? In this urgent time of war, what is most needed is clearly the formation of a new government that includes members of the opposition Labour and Liberal parties, to form a united front against the enemy. The necessary condition for forming a unified government must first be ascertained. Therefore, yesterday afternoon, with the help of some colleagues, I carefully studied this issue. By this afternoon, it became apparent that under the leadership of another Prime Minister, this necessary unity could be achieved, but not under my leadership. Given these circumstances, my responsibility has become clear. Tonight, I went to the palace and submitted my resignation to the King, which the King accepted. The King has now appointed my friend Churchill to organize a new government on a national unity basis. I am confident that Churchill will succeed in this endeavor. My other colleagues have indicated to me that they will submit their resignations to Churchill, but they will of course remain in their positions temporarily pending the appointment of the new government. Perhaps I might mention that Churchill has expressed to me his sincerity in inviting me to serve in the War Cabinet, and I have told him that I am willing to assist him in that capacity. This broadcast is my last communication to the nation from 10 Downing Street. Therefore, I have a few things I wish to say to the people. I have held the office of Prime Minister for three years. During this time, I have borne the heavy burden of worry and responsibility. Whenever I believed there was an opportunity to preserve peace honorably, I strived not to miss it. When the last hope was extinguished and war was unavoidable, I similarly strived to wage the war to the best of my ability. The nation may recall my words in the broadcast on September 3rd of last year, when I said that we must fight against evil. My words at that time were insufficient to describe the evils of the great war that is now beginning, to which we are devoting everything. Although this war will last for some time, the period of expectation and uncertainty has now ended. The nation should feel somewhat relieved by this, as the time of testing for us and the innocent people of Holland, Belgium, and France has now arrived. Let our people rally behind our new leader and, with our united strength and unwavering faith, fight until this beast, which has broken loose to harm people, is finally overthrown."

<p>Paris – The Premier's Office has issued a communiqué stating that Premier Reynaud has decided to reshuffle the cabinet to meet the needs of the current situation, so that all parties in the country can participate in national affairs and overcome difficulties together. The Premier has requested that Mallard, leader of the far-right Republican Federation, and Ibarra Garan, deputy leader of the French Social Studies Party (formerly the right-wing Croix-de-Feu), both join the cabinet as ministers without portfolio and be allowed to attend cabinet war meetings. In addition, the undersecretaries of various ministries and the directors of various departments have jointly submitted their resignations to the Premier, so that the cabinet organization can become more compact. The Premier has approved all resignations except for those of the heads of the War Council, the Office of the Premier, the Civilian Evacuation Department, and the two aviation intelligence departments, as their duties are technical. Observers generally believe that after the partial cabinet reshuffle, the number of cabinet members has been reduced from 35 to 28, of which 24 are ministers or above, and 4 are directors and department heads. Moreover, because representatives of various parties from both the left and right are participating in the cabinet, a national unity cabinet has truly lived up to its name. Most members of the majority party in the Chamber of Deputies have expressed satisfaction with the Premier's ability to reshuffle the cabinet in such a short period of time. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<p>Paris – French Premier Reynaud broadcast last night that French troops had crossed the border into Belgium between 6:00 and 7:00 a.m. Hitler has removed his mask, and now is the time for French troops and aircraft to display their power.

<h3 id="e35">Major Victory for Chinese Forces in Southern Henan and Northern Hubei: Reasons for the Victory; An Encirclement Extending Over a Thousand Li; Remarks by Commander Li <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>Somewhere in Northern Hubei – After learning of the major victory in Southern Henan, Northern Hubei, and Central Hubei, a Central News Agency reporter visited Commander Li today. At that time, Li was speaking with a certain Commander-in-Chief. The Chief of Staff, who was present, first told the reporter the reasons for the victory. The Chief of Staff first said that the Japanese army's offensive this time was extremely broad, stretching from Xin (yang) and Zheng (yang) in the east to Xin (ye) and Deng County in the west, and including the Tongbai and Dahong Mountains in the middle. Just the arc from Zhongxiang to Xin yang alone was over a thousand li, which shows the vastness of this battlefield. Before the Japanese launched their offensive, the Chinese army had already deployed an even larger battlefield than the Japanese intended. Therefore, when the Japanese formed this encirclement, they believed that the Chinese field army had entered it. In reality, the main force of the Chinese army was outside, forming two major encirclements to implement a counter-encirclement, attacking the main force of the Japanese army and inflicting the most severe punishment on them. At the same time, the Chinese army pre-reserved a portion of its forces within the Japanese encirclement, which never retreated. While the Japanese wanted to guide the main force of the Chinese army into the encirclement, they had to expand the encirclement, and at the same time, they could not eliminate the Chinese forces that were surrounded. As a result, they completely lost control and fell into a state of disintegration. Within this winding encirclement of thousands of li, the Japanese rear lines of communication were cut off everywhere by the Chinese army. In the initial stages, the situation took shape in which the Japanese were individually surrounded by the Chinese army, gradually falling completely into the Chinese net. At this point in his explanation, the Chief of Staff left his seat, and Commander Li turned to the reporter and said, "Using troops is like a businessman doing business. Whether you speculate or not, as long as you seize the opportunity and invest your capital, you will definitely reap great profits. The more capital we invest in this battle, the greater the victory." Li then smiled and said to the Commander-in-Chief, "I have seen that the Japanese only have this one skill." Finally, he told the reporter that the Chinese army's victory this time was entirely due to the success of its strategy. The strategy predicted by our highest-level command can be called a quick hand that determines the fate of the world, enough to shock both ancient and modern times. (11th)</p>

<p>Chongqing – According to reliable sources, Linchuan County in Jiangxi Province was bombed by Japanese planes on April 13th. The dead and wounded were mostly Catholic followers who had been taken in by the church as refugees, as well as the students of the affiliated orphanage. Because they were under the protection of the American church, they gathered together and were unwilling to disperse, resulting in this disaster. Also, the last time Chinese planes bombed Yueyang, the Japanese immediately raised their Japanese flag high in the refugee area when they were attacked from the air, and strictly forbade refugees from going out.

<p>According to someone from Hong Kong, a well-known figure from Shanghai recently flew to Chongqing via Hong Kong to pay a visit to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and seek his instructions. After returning to Hong Kong, he told his friends that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek was extremely optimistic about the future of the war, stating that a new situation would develop in three months and that he had absolute confidence in ultimate victory. When analyzing the international situation and the recent situation of the Sino-Japanese War, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek expressed a highly confident attitude. He also said that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek was in excellent health, with a radiant complexion, and even more glowing than when he was seen last winter. He handles important official matters every day in a calm and unhurried manner, showing no signs of fatigue. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek recently flew to the front lines of a certain war zone to inspect the situation. Before departing, he expressed great concern about the financial changes in Shanghai and said that the government had great determination to maintain currency credibility and would make every effort to protect the livelihood of Shanghai's industry, commerce, and people.</p>
<h3 id="e45">National Salvation Bonds: Third Interest Payment <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>Payment to Begin at the End of August; Funds to Be Allocated from Tax Revenue</p>
<p>In order to encourage the people to concentrate their financial resources and pay for national salvation, the National Government issued five hundred million yuan in National Salvation Bonds, stipulating that individuals or organizations who paid for national salvation in cash or valuables would be given the bonds according to the amount they paid. The bonds carried an annual interest rate of four percent and a term of thirty years, with principal to be repaid by lottery starting in 1941. At that time, compatriots across the country and overseas Chinese unanimously subscribed to the bonds, which were quickly fully subscribed and official bond certificates were issued. A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency learned from banking circles yesterday that the third interest payment on the National Salvation Bonds, totaling 20 million yuan in national currency, would be allocated by the Ministry of Finance from national treasury tax revenue and deposited into a special account by the four banks of the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Communications Bank, and the Agricultural Bank, for payment starting on August 31st. This proves that the government's commitment to maintaining creditworthiness remains unchanged.</p>
<h3 id="e46">The Sixteenth Embankment Blockade Line Remains the Same <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>The Opening of Southern Huangpu; Effect is Equal to Zero</p>
<p>Since the Japanese side announced that it would open the upstream of the Huangpu River south of the Sixteenth Embankment Blockade Line and its banks starting on the 15th of this month, according to the reporter's investigation over the past few days, the sunken ships at the Sixteenth Embankment Blockade Line remain unmoved. The channel cleared by the Japanese navy two years ago is very narrow, and ships over 700-800 tons can no longer pass through. Ships of 1,000 or 2,000 tons are even more out of the question. This remains the case to this day. Therefore, after the opening, wanting to allow foreign shipping companies to resume shipping in the southern Huangpu is tantamount to drawing a cake to satisfy hunger. As for the situation on both banks of the southern Huangpu, the warehouses of various shipping companies such as Ningshao, Sanbei, Dada, and Datong in the Nanshi area are still in ruins. The situation on the Pudong side is that part of the Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. is also obstructed, and large ships cannot dock. The New Wharf of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company south of Jardine Matheson is under Japanese military control, and the Yuan Yi Wharf is occupied by the Japanese. Both are unable to resume operations. Only the warehouses and wharves of the Japanese companies Mitsubishi and Osaka at the Old Bund are preparing to resume operations, using wheel-loaded iron barges to transport goods as a transitional measure. Apart from the area south of this, where the warehouses and wharves in Nanshi and Pudong are lined up densely, the area further south is desolate, almost like a dead zone. Now, with only four days left until the opening date, general observation suggests that the so-called "opening" has an effect equal to zero.</p>
<h3 id="e47">Road Workers on Strike Yesterday <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>The English-language Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury reported that approximately 2,000 coolies from the Shanghai Municipal Council Public Works Department are demanding an increase of $1.40 in wages and a rice allowance, and went on strike starting this morning (the 11th). Around 9:00 a.m., the striking workers overturned garbage trucks several times at the Public Works Department's material station in the Western Hongkou, causing garbage to be scattered all over the nearby roads. Soon, slogans explaining the demands for increased wages and rice allowances were posted at various material stations of the Public Works Department within the International Settlement.</p>
<p>Worker Demands: The Shanghai Municipal Council Public Works Department road workers and sanitation workers, due to the recent sharp decline in foreign exchange rates and soaring prices, feel greatly threatened in their livelihood. As a last resort, they sent representatives to the authorities on the 25th of last month to demand improved treatment. The content of the demands included: (1) Coolie wages are too low, and it is not enough to support a family of parents, wives, and children. They request that the authorities consider the livelihood of the workers and improve their treatment. (2) They request that one bag of rationed rice be issued each month (priced at $20). (3) Because workers have to work in the rain, which is very difficult, they request that the authorities provide raincoats, one for each person. (4) They request that wages be paid for holidays (such as Sundays, foreign Qingming, and Winter Solstice). (5) Those who have worked for 20 years or more request that their pensions be paid immediately. These demands were submitted in writing to the Public Works Department and Mr. Yu Qiaqing was asked to mediate.</p>
<h3 id="e48">Attempted Robbery of Tax Revenue Fails; Japanese Side Actually Files a Protest; Police Confirm No Political Connection; Japanese Attempt to Exaggerate the Incident and Create Further Problems <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>(Ping Ming News Agency) At approximately 6:05 p.m. the night before last, an attempted robbery of Jianghai Customs tax revenue by five or six bandits turned into a major struggle with detectives. In addition to injuring four people, including Chinese, English, and Indian officers, on the Japanese side, Corporal Shimakan Matsuji, a member of the Military Police Corps, was shot through the thigh, Takahashi Yuki, a money escort from the Zheng Yu Bank, was shot in the left wrist, and Kawano Yoshiharu suffered lacerations to the head and face from broken car window glass. None of the injuries were life-threatening.</p>
<p>The Detained Bandit: A Gambler</p>
<p>According to inquiries, the bandit who was injured, fell to the ground, and was captured was named Wu Guichen, 25 years old, a gambler at the Guangxi Club gambling den at 135 Jessfield Road in Western Shanghai. On the evening of the 10th of this month, due to heavy gambling losses, he conspired with his companions to rob the Jianghai Customs tax revenue. The five men set off on a Route 10 bus and walked to the front of the Bank of Communications to carry out the robbery.</p>
<p>Exploiting the Issue; Actually Filing a Protest</p>
<p>After the incident, the Japanese side exploited the issue, deliberately labeling this ordinary robbery as having a political background, creating a tense situation. They immediately convened a so-called emergency meeting of army and navy representatives and consular officials late into the night, and at 1:30 a.m. yesterday morning, Japanese personnel visited Mr. Bowen, the head of the police department of the Shanghai Municipal Council, late into the night. Major Bowen personally received them and the Japanese side immediately submitted a written protest regarding this matter, delivering it to Mr. Bowen in person and making certain demands.</p>
<p>Japanese Newspapers Fuel the Flames</p>
<p>Yesterday, Japanese newspapers even further spread fear, saying that this move by the Japanese side was only the first step and that a second step would be taken if necessary. According to observations from reliable foreign sources, the attempted robbery of Jianghai Customs tax revenue was originally an ordinary robbery case. Now, the Japanese side is clearly taking advantage of the current situation of the European war and the tense situation to once again use this as an excuse to create problems for the Shanghai Municipal Council, seeking to realize its consistent plot.</p>
<p>Police Commissioner Bowen Expresses His Attitude</p>
<p>According to another report, the Japanese side sent a delegation to visit Police Commissioner Bowen of the Shanghai Municipal Council at 12:50 a.m. yesterday morning to protest the robbery of tax revenue and demand a thorough investigation of the bandits. According to Mr. Bowen, Police Commissioner of the Shanghai Municipal Council, the Japanese delegation was led by Japanese military police officer Miura and stayed at the police station for two hours. However, he only told the Japanese representatives that the Shanghai Municipal Council was willing to make its best efforts to handle the case. As for those injured by stray bullets, only Qin Shengping, the driver of the Silver Cab Company, was seriously injured. The police have now confirmed that this case has nothing to do with politics. The bandits' attempt to rob the customs revenue was nothing more than coveting a large sum of money.</p>

<p>After the European war progressed to the Netherlands, the Dutch Consulate in Shanghai received a telegram from Dutch Foreign Minister Van Kleffens around 4:00 p.m. on the 10th, reporting that German troops had invaded the Netherlands. The telegram stated, "Germany did not present any diplomatic note to the Netherlands beforehand and suddenly invaded the Netherlands. The airport has also been bombed." According to Mr. Bolssevein, the Dutch Consul General in Shanghai, there will be no changes to the administration of Dutch nationals in the Far East. Dutch shipping lines will also be maintained as usual. The attitude of Dutch residents in Shanghai is extremely calm.</p>
<p>Dutch and Belgian Exchange Rates Without Quotes Yesterday</p>
<p>The English-language Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury reported that this morning (the 11th), the exchange market in Shanghai had no trading quotes for Dutch guilders and Belgian francs because no market information had been received from overseas. The opening price for legal tender against the US dollar was $4.5625, quickly strengthening to $4.6875, showing that legal tender still has some strength amidst the financial chaos in New York and London. The Shanghai branches of the two major Dutch banks, the Hollandsche Bank-Unie and the Nederlandsch-Indische Escompto Maatschappij, are operating as usual.</p>
<p>The United States Temporarily Prohibits Withdrawals from Dutch and Belgian Banks</p>
<p>However, the deposits of these two banks and other Dutch financial institutions in New York have been temporarily suspended by order of the US government. Therefore, these deposits cannot be withdrawn. According to the US government's explanation, the reason for taking this action is to protect the depositors in the areas of the Netherlands and Belgium occupied by German troops, so that they are not forced to hand over their foreign exchange holdings in the United States by the invaders. It is reported that not only did the Netherlands and Belgium not ask the US government to suspend the payment of deposits, but they even asked for the cancellation of this restriction.</p>
<p>German Deposits Continue to Be Paid</p>
<p>Dutch banks in Shanghai expect this matter to be clarified within a few days and everything to be resolved. Dutch and Belgian businesses in Shanghai have not yet received new instructions from the Dutch and Belgian governments regarding the German invasion of their countries. Therefore, the Shanghai branches of Dutch banks continue to pay out deposits to German citizens this morning.</p>
<p>Run on Dutch and Belgian Banks</p>
<p>The banks in Shanghai belonging to Dutch and Belgian businesses include the Dutch bank Hollandsche Bank-Unie, located in the Sassoon House on the Bund, with its head office in Amsterdam, Netherlands, and Shanghai as a branch; the Dutch bank Nederlandsch-Indische Escompto Maatschappij, located at the corner of Jiangxi Road and Jiujiang Road, with its head office in Amsterdam, Netherlands, and Shanghai as a branch; and the Belgian bank Banque Belge Pour L'Etranger, located at 20 The Bund, with its head office in Brussels, Belgium, and Shanghai as a branch. Since the German invasion of the Netherlands and Belgium, Chinese and foreign merchants, due to the involvement of the Netherlands and Belgium in the war, have been withdrawing deposits from these Shanghai branches. According to a reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency who inquired with foreign banking circles yesterday, it is indeed true that Chinese and foreign merchants are making withdrawals from these three banks. Yesterday, Saturday, was a regular day off in the afternoon. It is reported that the amount of money withdrawn from each bank in the morning was very large, especially by Germans. Chinese were second. There were not many deposits from British, French, and American merchants. It is reported that the three banks have borrowed enough cash to deal with the withdrawals.</p>
<p>British Women's Association Serves the Motherland</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the European war on September 3rd of last year, the Allied forces of Britain and France and the Nazi army have been at a standstill for half a year. Now Germany has gone a step further, attacking the Netherlands and Belgium and occupying Luxembourg, and the situation has once again entered a tense stage. When the news came, people from all countries were concerned. The members of the British Women's Association in Shanghai, in order to better serve their motherland, have decided to hold a meeting at the association's headquarters at 10:00 a.m. on Wednesday, the 23rd of this month. The British Women's Association collected clothing, socks, vests, and other items a month ago and shipped them to the front lines in their home country.</p>
<h3 id="e50">Coal Briquette Guild Decides to Continue Selling at Discounted Prices <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>Petitioning the Chamber of Commerce to Set Uniform Prices</p>
<p>The Shanghai Coal Briquette Industry Association held a joint meeting of various factories at its headquarters in the Coal Industry Building on Tianjin Road at 3:00 p.m. yesterday to discuss continuing discounted sales and setting uniform coal briquette prices. Representatives from 18 companies, including Yi Tai Xing, Nanyang, Hua Cheng, Cui Ji, and Yan Yan, attended, including Chen Cuifang, You Chunxin, and 16 others. Chen Cuifang chaired the meeting. During the meeting, the representatives expressed their opinions one after another, unanimously believing that it was necessary to continue holding discounted sales based on the crowded conditions at various factories in recent days. The following discounted sales measures were discussed and decided: (1) The discounted sales period will be from the 13th to the 31st of this month, for a total of 18 days. Time: From 2:00 p.m. every day until sold out. (2) Each person is limited to buying 40 cents worth, totaling 6 jin, which is 6.666 yuan per dan. (3) The amount of discounted sales and the coal briquette factories providing the coal are still being solicited. After gathering, they will be announced together with the 60+ discounted sales locations.</p>
<p>Setting Prices</p>
<p>At present, the price of coal briquettes on the market, although it has fallen from 9.5 yuan per dan to 8.4 yuan, is still not uniform. The Coal Briquette Industry Association has petitioned the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce to set a fair price in order to allow all coal briquette manufacturers to follow suit. It is reported that the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce is actively investigating the cost of coal briquettes and the purchasing power of citizens in order to determine an appropriate selling price.</p>
<p>Discounted Sales Measures</p>
<p>According to a reporter from the Datong News Agency, the quantity of discounted sales by each factory has also been agreed upon. Yi Tai Xing will sell 500 dan per day until sold out, Nanyang will sell 200 dan per day until sold out, and the remaining factories, such as Guohua, Dongfang, Huacheng, Jinghua, Gongyong, Yuanfeng, Yuanhua, etc., will sell from 150 dan to 10 dan, respectively.</p>
<p>Market Price Falls Back</p>
<p>The recent rise in the market price of coal briquettes is only a temporary trend and will soon fall back. This is because the authorities have repeatedly issued orders to suppress it, and major hoarders have also been taking coal slag out of their warehouses to supply the market. Therefore, the raw materials for various coal briquette factories are no longer scarce, and their costs have also slightly decreased. In addition, speculators, fearing additional losses, have no intention of stirring up the market and hoarding large quantities. According to Yi Tai Xing and the Coal Company, a total of 17,022 tons of coal slag were sold in April. It is also known that the market price of bituminous coal has fallen back slightly yesterday, indicating the abundance of coal stocks.</p>
<h3 id="e51">Shanghai and Mainland Trade Increasingly Difficult <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>Saigon Bureau Telegram: Suspension of Yunnan Goods Transport</p>
<p>Since the fall of Guangzhou, Shanghai's shipments to the mainland have relied on Haiphong as a transit port. However, due to the excessive volume of goods, local vehicles are insufficient for transport, resulting in stockpiles, some said to remain uncleared for months. Since last summer, Shanghai-Hong Kong transport companies began exploring alternative routes, transporting goods to Saigon for loading onto trains directly to Kunming. Although freight costs were higher, the time saved made it a quicker option, attracting many shippers. The day before yesterday (the 9th), Shanghai transportation companies suddenly received a telegram from Saigon stating that the Bureau had announced a complete suspension of goods destined for Kunming via Saigon. However, goods that had already arrived before the announcement could still be transported. This measure undoubtedly deals a major blow to Shanghai-Kunming freight, and trade between Shanghai and the mainland will likely become increasingly difficult.</p>

<p>The European war situation is gradually expanding. Less than a month after Denmark and Norway were occupied, German troops launched an offensive against the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg. There are reports of Luxembourg being occupied. Simultaneously, the Netherlands was attacked, and Belgium was bombed by German forces. However, both countries were prepared. The Dutch army has been mobilized, and there are reports of contact with German forces, making the European situation increasingly severe. The movements of Dutch ships are attracting considerable attention.</p>
<p>Dutch Shipping Routes</p>
<p>Upon further investigation yesterday, the local Dutch shipping agency is the Java Mailboat Company, located at 133 Sichuan Road. This company is the sole Far East shipping agency for Dutch merchants, with vessels operating routes between the Dutch East Indies, Shanghai, and Japan. It also represents the Royal Dutch Company, operating African routes. Now, because the Netherlands has been attacked by German forces and drawn into the European war, Dutch ships are significantly affected.</p>
<p>Vessels Suspended</p>
<p>The Java Company's scheduled liner, the Tjisadane, departed Surabaya on the 26th of last month, calling at various ports in Southeast Asia en route to Shanghai. It passed Hong Kong the day before yesterday (the 10th) and arrived in Xiamen yesterday morning. It was scheduled to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow (Monday). However, due to the war in its home country, the vessel was ordered yesterday to return to Hong Kong to await further instructions, and its trip to Shanghai has been temporarily suspended.</p>
<p>Temporarily Not Proceeding</p>
<p>The first-line mail ship, the Tjinagara, which departed Surabaya on the 3rd of this month for Shanghai, has also been affected by the above circumstances. It has now arrived at Little Luzon and will not proceed north, awaiting orders in the Philippines. The company's new mail ship, the Tjitaroem, returned to Java on the 2nd of this month. According to the scheduled voyage, it is currently between Little Luzon or Cebu. It is uncertain whether it will proceed. As for the Royal Company's vessels, they will likely suffer the same fate. It is rumored that Dutch shipping will operate similarly to the resumed voyages of Norwegian merchant ships.</p>
<p>Requisitioning British Ships</p>
<p>The British government recently ordered that all British ships operating in the Far East, except those on the Yangtze River, will be requisitioned at any time. British shipping companies have been preparing for requisitioning since the order was issued. According to shipping industry sources, the British government's requisitioning of Far East British ships has previously been limited to iron barges. Although the scope of requisitioning is now broader, the goal remains to avoid impacting the business of shipping companies. That is, vessels not regularly operating on specific routes, or those with smaller capacity or less essential functions, will be requisitioned first. Therefore, the overall shipping industry will not be significantly affected.</p>
<p>Dutch Consulate Announcement</p>
<p>According to a statement released yesterday by the Dutch Consulate in Shanghai, Dutch ships operating in the Far East are only permitted to dock at Allied ports. According to Dutch Consul General Posvafen, he believes that Dutch ships will resume their voyages in the Far East in the near future. Additionally, another Dutch vessel, carrying 4,055 tons of coal, was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai this morning, but it did not arrive. As of last night, there was no news of it.</p>

<p>According to the North China Daily News, the Shanghai Municipal Council subcommittee held a meeting at the Council Building yesterday (the 10th) afternoon, chaired by Mr. Marshall. Based on the various reports received by the committee, the current stocks of rice and flour in Shanghai, based on the current consumption rate, are sufficient to maintain supply. The committee met for a long time yesterday. Due to the tightening of the exchange rate of legal tender, overseas procurement will be very difficult. In the future, it is planned to obtain sufficient supplies from the mainland and transport sufficient rice on time to meet the needs of the city. The committee also plans to adopt more effective measures to curb speculation in the rice market. The implementation of commodity price labeling in the markets controlled by the Shanghai Municipal Council is very satisfactory. Soon, all shops will be required to implement the same measures. The price labeling regulations have been in effect since April 15, and enough time has passed for the shops to prepare for compliance.</p>

<p>According to the Da Zhong News Agency, Lu Baochu, the manager of the Sheng Da rice shop in Shanghai, violated market trading rules. After being reported by the Market Management Committee to the French police for arrest and interrogation, it is now learned that Mr. Lu has been released on bail. However, the issue of his violation of rice market trading rules will be discussed by the French Concession Public Works Bureau's Committee for Stabilizing Daily Necessities, which will determine penalties.</p>
<p>Implementation Plan</p>
<p>It is also learned that the French Concession Public Works Bureau's Committee for Stabilizing Daily Necessities held a full meeting on the 9th, passing three plans to crack down on hoarding and excessive profits, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. According to the Da Zhong News Agency reporter, these plans have been approved by the Price Control Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement and by Consul General Oqiba. They will be implemented within one or two days.</p>
<p>Supply Gradually Improving</p>
<p>According to a member of the Stabilization Committee, the main reasons for the soaring prices of goods in the city are the speculation and hoarding by merchants in the Concession, and the supply problem is the most important. Since the rice transported to Shanghai from the occupied areas has been restricted and heavily taxed, the price of rice in the city has continued to rise. The import of foreign rice has also been hindered by the tightening of foreign exchange, which has increased costs and made it impossible to order. Therefore, the authorities of the two Concessions are now discussing ways to improve supply with the Japanese. Although the food supply in the city is difficult, it will not cause a serious panic. Recently, more than 2,000 bags of rice have been transported to Shanghai from the occupied areas every day, and the city's rice reserves are sufficient for consumption. The foreign rice ordered before the dramatic change in the exchange market is also continuously arriving. As for the proposal for a food procurement and sales control agency, it is difficult to achieve because it is not easy to raise 50 million yuan.</p>
<p>Reasonable Control</p>
<p>According to reliable sources, since the supply of rice and coal in the city is not likely to cause a panic, reasonable control of the market can prevent prices from rising too much. Therefore, the two Concessions are making every effort to improve the conditions of the retail markets for rice and coal. In addition to (1) restricting the quantity of coal cinder coupons sold, and (2) preventing the return transaction of food, which have already been clearly ordered to be implemented, the shops will soon be required to implement commodity price labeling and prevent illegal trading in the markets. At the same time, it is hoped that the public will report merchants who engage in speculation and hoarding, so that they can be severely punished and gradually restrained.</p>
<h3 id="e55">Scarce Pig Supply Causes Meat Prices to Skyrocket <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>Due to the scarcity of pigs shipped to Shanghai from various counties in northern Jiangsu in recent days, only about 1,000 or 700 to 800 pigs arrive in the city each day. According to inquiries, the city's needs are at least 3,000 pigs, which is difficult to meet. As a result, market prices have soared, reaching 1.45 yuan per catty. Yesterday, sources in the fresh meat industry said that the refrigerated stocks of all meat shops are being depleted as demand exceeds supply. If no large number of pigs arrive in the city this week, a meat shortage will inevitably occur. Therefore, more than 1,000 large and small restaurants throughout the city are deeply worried that their main food supply will not be sufficient. If transportation is interrupted and supply is cut off, the meat shops will virtually close down.</p>

<h3 id="e57">Financial Market Unaffected by European War Expansion; Foreign Exchange Fluctuations Have Shifted from Parallel Market to Looser; Transfer of Shanghai Capital Inward Is Essential <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>Since the Ministry of Finance telegraphed Shanghai to refute the baselessness of restrictions on withdrawals, declaring its determination to maintain currency credibility and stabilize finance, the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee has also made every effort to maintain Shanghai's black market foreign exchange. As a result, rumors in the financial market have subsided, and people are at ease. The day before yesterday, due to the German invasion of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg, the European war expanded, and speculators in the Shanghai financial market resorted to their old tricks, frantically buying up foreign exchange, hoarding gold, and hoarding goods, creating undesirable phenomena such as tightening exchange rates and rising gold prices. The situation has eased slightly since yesterday morning. Although the exchange rate quoted by the British HSBC bank has not changed, the actual transaction rate has loosened, and there are rumors that the US dollar will depreciate. As a result, the selling trend of foreign exchange is prevalent. As for the legal exchange rate quoted by the Central Bank, it remains the same as before, which proves that China's legal exchange rate remains unchanged.</p>
<p>Speculation and Manipulation Drive Up Prices</p>
<p>A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency learned from the financial community yesterday that Shanghai is flooded with idle capital and lacks proper channels for use, resulting in manipulation by speculators. Their speculation targets include: (1) buying and selling black market foreign exchange and arbitrage; (2) hoarding daily necessities; (3) buying and selling gold, stocks, and securities; (4) engaging in illegal exchange discounts; and (5) buying and selling foreign currency and banknotes. All of the above are the biggest factors contributing to the soaring prices. Therefore, the prices of all daily necessities are rising, and it is all attributed to the hoarding by unscrupulous merchants. However, the prices of foods that are not easily perishable and cannot be stored for a long time are also rising, which should be due to the impact of rising prices of major commodities. Once one item rises, everything rises, and its harm to people's livelihoods is self-evident. If it is not strictly cracked down on, social security and people's livelihoods will be affected.</p>
<p>Legitimate Businesses Suffer</p>
<p>Rumors in the financial market are like spring clouds, sometimes appearing and sometimes disappearing. There is not a week without them. Recently, there have been rumors that the government will not maintain the black market foreign exchange and will once again restrict withdrawals. Now, after the Ministry of Finance strongly refuted the rumors, they have subsided. Recently, due to the German invasion of the Netherlands and Belgium, there have been new rumors in the market, and speculators are using all their skills to manipulate everything. The violent fluctuations in the foreign exchange rate are detrimental to legitimate businesses. Therefore, the shift from a turbulent exchange market to a stable one should be welcomed by everyone, but only those who use it for speculation will be distressed. The same is true for other stock and gold markets. Therefore, transferring Shanghai's idle capital inward is an urgent matter at present.</p>

<h3 id="e58">North China "United Reserve Bank Notes" in Dire Straits; Falling Sharply Following Exchange Rate Decline; Prices in Tianjin and Beijing Higher Than in Shanghai <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>According to foreign sources, there is a profit of ten yuan for every hundred yuan of legal tender shipped from Hong Kong to Shanghai, because the legal tender exchange rate in Shanghai is higher than in Hong Kong. The reason for this situation is the high exchange rate for remittances from the mainland. The Chinese government, in order to prevent capital from escaping or flowing into the occupied areas, charges extremely high fees for remittances from the mainland to Shanghai, in order to restrict them. Remittances from Hong Kong to Shanghai are also affected by the foreign exchange control in Hong Kong, so those who smuggle legal tender do so from time to time.</p>
<p>Establishing a Puppet Bank Is Just Empty Talk</p>
<p>Although a preparatory committee has been established for the puppet "Central Bank," it lacks preparations and concrete measures. Previously, it was rumored that the Yokohama Specie Bank would use the legal tender from customs revenue to exchange for foreign exchange and lend it to the puppet "Central Bank." However, this has been hindered since the exchange rate was reduced. The fluctuation of the exchange rate, the intermittent supply, and the movements of the Japanese banks are closely related and have been for a long time. Adding the pressure of arbitrage to the black market will only further reduce the exchange rate. The gains will be limited, and the result will be to further disrupt the economy in its occupied areas.</p>
<p>Puppet Banks in North China Plunge Miserably</p>
<p>Because the "United Reserve Bank Notes" have no reserves and have no value in themselves, the market price has always been below the legal tender because the Japanese forced their circulation in North China using their military power. Regardless of whether the Japanese puppets prohibit the circulation of legal tender or force one yuan of legal tender in North China to be equivalent to six jiao of "United Reserve Bank Notes," they have never been able to raise the price of the puppet currency. According to travelers who have just arrived in Shanghai from Tianjin and Beijing, after the legal tender exchange rate in Shanghai was reduced at the beginning of this month, the "United Reserve Bank Notes" exchange rate also plummeted. On the 4th of this month, the US dollar exchange rate in Tianjin and Beijing was only four yuan. At the same time, prices skyrocketed. Tian Guan brand flour in Beijing was 18 yuan per bag, and Saigon rice was 78 yuan per bag, both several yuan higher than before. The rise in cotton yarn and cotton cloth was even more significant. Mobil kerosene in Tianjin was as high as 42.35 yuan per box. The prices of other foreign goods were 10-20% higher than in Shanghai. Recently, Japanese newspapers have repeatedly emphasized how the legal tender is, and how prices are, but in fact, the fate of the puppet currency parasitic on the legal tender is even more miserable.</p>

<p>Six Months Imprisonment, Two Years Probation</p>
<p>Yu Jinsheng, a foreman at the Fuxin Flour Mill No. 7, submitted his resignation to the factory on March 28 and hired Xue Yougui to take over as foreman, resulting in a brawl between the new and old workers on West Suzhou Road on the day of the handover. Constable No. 281, who was suppressing the scene, was also injured. Due to the urgency of the situation, he opened fire in self-defense and arrested seven old workers: Liu Debiao, Hong Youdao, Li Gaowang, Liang Youwang, Gao Hong, Huang Xuecai, and Liu Wenqi. However, Huang Xuecai died in the hospital due to his serious injuries, and Liang Youwang also remained in the hospital due to his serious injuries. The remaining five people, including Liu Debiao, were sent to the Second Criminal Division of the First Special Court. The defendants hired Yu Enliang, Qian Zheng, and Song Yuntao to appear in court and requested to be released on bail first. The court approved their release on bail upon guarantee by their lawyers, pending the recovery of Liang Youwang's injuries. Now Liang's injuries have not yet healed, and the other defendants have been making a living by working and cannot stay in Shanghai for a long time after losing their jobs, so they requested an early trial, which was approved. The case was heard yesterday morning by Judge Chuan Lin in the Second Criminal Division. The defendant Hong Youdao did not appear. Lawyer Zhang Tianyin of the police station presented the case, and after the defense by the defendants' lawyers, the court sentenced Liu Debiao, Li Gaowang, Gao Hong, and Liu Wenqi to six months imprisonment each, with a two-year probation, and confiscated the weapons.</p>

<p>Over a Thousand Residents, with Nowhere to Go After Eviction</p>
<p>Many residents live in the Goods Building on Aiduya Road in Shanghai after the war. Recently, the owners ordered them to move out. The residents yesterday jointly appealed to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, the Taxpayers' Association, the Citizens' Federation, and other public organizations for assistance. The original letter stated, "We, the tenants, mostly rent and live in the Goods Building at No. 110 Aiduya Road due to the national crisis. We have been living here for many years. Except for a few businesses, most of us have lost our assets and have nowhere to go. We have always been law-abiding and do not interfere in external affairs. We have never been in arrears with rent or house tax. However, the landlord, the Dehe Foreign Firm, disregarding the difficulty of finding a house in this extraordinary period, strictly limited the time to move out of the house. Considering that there are more than a thousand tenants in the entire building, it is impossible to find a place to live for everyone after moving out. We will inevitably be exposed on the streets. The landlord's actions are truly disregarding the suffering of the people. The tenants are no different from refugees and cannot suffer further setbacks. We have gone to ask the landlord to withdraw the order, but it has not been resolved so far. The tenants are deeply afraid that the demolition dispute in Yuqing Lane will be repeated here. We hereby implore your esteemed association to uphold justice and find a way to prevent the disaster from happening, and the tenants will offer incense and pray."</p>

<p>Another Defendant Acquitted of Receiving Stolen Goods</p>
<p>Ding Guanghong, a young man from Suzhou, 23 years old, residing at No. 37, 70th Street, Bushi Road, and his companion Yin Yi (16 years old, residing at No. 3, 70th Lane, Albair Road) were riding and playing on bicycles at the intersection of Bushi Road and Sapose Road at 11:00 AM on the 20th of last month. A Russian man passing by in a rickshaw accidentally dropped a diamond ring worth 25,000 yuan from his hand. Ding and Yin saw it, picked it up, and Ding took the diamond ring to a jewelry store in Jing'an Shopping Mall to sell it, selling it for 4,800 yuan. The store paid 2,800 yuan in cash and a 2,000 yuan post-dated check. At that time, Ding only gave Yin 400 yuan in cash and a 2,000 yuan check. Later, Hao Shanshan, a local hooligan, heard about this and went to Yin's house to extort 400 yuan, so Ding only got a post-dated check, which he was very dissatisfied with. He immediately reported it to the French police, and the head of the police station sent detectives to arrest Ding and Yin and send them to the Eighth Criminal Division of the Second Special Court, where they were charged with embezzlement of lost property. Yesterday morning, Judge Qiu Huaning concluded the trial and ruled: "The main text" Yin Yi is fined 40 yuan for embezzling lost property, with a two-year suspended sentence. Ding Guanghong is acquitted of receiving stolen goods.</p>

Towle could no longer bear it, so he began to investigate, specially sprinkling a little powdered blue dye on the banknotes and placing them in the drawer, and sealing the drawer with paper strips. Shortly after, Towle returned to the room from outside and saw that the paper strips on the drawer had been torn off, and a five-yuan banknote inside had disappeared.

<h3 id="e87">Finance: Hong Kong Funds Flow to Shanghai in Large Amounts, Dutch and Belgian Banks Experience Deposit Runs, Some Sold on the Black Market, Exchange Rate Gradually Lengthens <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: HSBC's listed prices showed no change. Unexpected fluctuations occurred in the unofficial English and American exchange rates. Amid the expansion of the European war, the American exchange rate suddenly shifted from tight to loose, and the English exchange rate also lengthened. It is said that funds from European belligerent countries fled Hong Kong and gathered in Shanghai, amounting to large sums. After the invasion of the Netherlands and Belgium, Chinese and Western businesses in this city started deposit runs on Dutch and Belgian banks. Some foreign currency depositors transferred their funds to American banks, but because American banks had limited capacity, some were sold on the black market. There were also rumors that the U.S. dollar might devalue. Foreign banks made few purchases, so the U.S. dollar went straight from 4.53125 to 4.8125 for settlement. The first shilling also loosened to 3 pence 625. Around 11:30 AM, a certain Chinese bank made some purchases, and the selling trend gradually subsided, so it rebounded slightly, eventually closing at 3 pence 5625 for the first shilling, 4.71875 for the U.S. dollar, 125 for the English dollar, and 09375 for the American dollar. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday.</p>
<p>English and American Exchange Rates Plunge Again</p>
<p>At the beginning of the morning, the London price was flat for both spot and forward trades. The New York silver price remained flat, and the London raw silver price remained stable. The English exchange rate was unchanged against the American exchange rate, lengthened by .0625 against the Shanghai exchange rate, unchanged against the French exchange rate, the American exchange rate was reduced by two jiao against the English exchange rate, unchanged against the Shanghai exchange rate, and dropped by nine and a half fen against the [unspecified currency]. The central bank's listed exchange rates remained unchanged. The opening cash selling prices for the banks in the morning were 3 pence 46875 for the English dollar and 4.53125 for the U.S. dollar, which were looser by .03125 for the English dollar and softer by .09375 for the U.S. dollar compared to the evening closing price of the previous day. This was due to the sharp drop in exchange rates. After opening, the market was erratic and uncertain, lacking buyers and having no transactions. Subsequently, American banks and foreign banks traded May U.S. dollars at 4.4375. HSBC's listed prices were announced to be unchanged, and the silver balance tax was also announced to be unchanged. After this, speculators and [Hong Kong] branches sold off, and buyers were reluctant to purchase, causing the price to stabilize and then loosen. At that time, Chinese merchants and speculators and Hong Kong branches sold May English dollars at 3 pence 46875 and U.S. dollars at 4.5625 to foreign banks, and Hong Kong Electric paid Lisha Xun spot English dollars at 3 pence 625 and 5625. Moreover, before long, Chinese and Western speculators aggressively released currency to American banks and foreign banks, causing the loosening trend to intensify. The spot U.S. dollar went to 4.6875, making a full price of 4.75. The current English and American closing prices were 3 pence 65625, and it was rumored that the spot U.S. dollar was hardest, reaching 4.8125. Speculators sold to Shanghai banks at this price. By 11:30 AM, the market gradually stabilized. As a result, the English dollar closed at 3 pence 5625, and the U.S. dollar at 4.71875. The English dollar for this month was 3 pence, and the U.S. dollar was 4.25. Compared with yesterday's closing price, the spot American lengthened by .09375, the English hardened by .125, this month's American loosened by .0625, and the [unspecified currency] lengthened by .125.</p>
<p>Hong Kong U.S. Dollar Also Shrinks Sharply</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 11th (Saturday) dispatch: The exchange market opened flat this morning. The exchange rates against the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen were not quoted, and the market had prices but no trading. The English dollar opened for spot and futures trading, at 1 shilling 2 pence 875. The Shanghai dollar spot price fell sharply by 12 yuan to 416 yuan. At 10:05 AM, the Shanghai dollar spot price continued to fall by 6 yuan to 410 yuan.

At 11:30 AM, the market was flat. The closing price was 20 yuan for the U.S. dollar and 413 yuan for the Shanghai dollar.</p>
<p>Tianjin: U.S. Dollar Tight, English Dollar Loosens</p>
<p>Tianjin, 11th (Saturday) dispatch: The exchange market opened soft this morning. The spot English dollar was looser by .03125 compared to yesterday's opening, at 3 pence 25. The spot U.S. dollar tightened by .25, at 4.1875. The Shanghai dollar rose by 7 jiao 5 fen to 109 yuan 7 jiao 5 fen. The "United Note" unofficial market was cheaper by 7 jiao yuan fen to 101 yuan 7 jiao 5 fen.</p>
<p>U.S. Dollar Fluctuates</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market: There was slightly more demand for English and American gold coupons early in the morning, and market prices rose slightly, but soon prices turned downward, and they all fell three yuan. The English gold coupons plunged significantly, with ample supply due to the sharp loosening of the black market English exchange rate, and the market price plunged two yuan and five jiao. U.S. gold coupons initially rose to 22 yuan in the morning due to the tragic fall of the pound, but soon rumors spread that the continuous decline of the pound would indirectly affect American export trade, so those who were generally nervous expected the American currency to devalue, causing the black market U.S. exchange rate to loosen significantly. U.S. gold coupons once retreated to 20 yuan and five jiao, but then recovered slightly, closing at 21 yuan and one jiao, a decrease of four jiao and a half compared to the previous day's settlement. Hong Kong coupons fell sharply along with the Hong Kong-Shanghai exchange rate by two jiao. The supply of French franc coupons, new Dutch coupons, Annam coupons, Robbie coupons, Can coupons, Philippine coupons, etc., was ample, and market prices all trended downward. The supply of Japanese gold coupons was also strong, and market prices were weak, with the evening market at 1 yuan, 2 jiao, 7 fen, and 5 li. The demand for Korean coupons decreased sharply, and market prices plunged by two fen, with the evening market at 9 jiao and 8 fen.</p>

<p>Yesterday's discount rate for bank drafts and bills of exchange rose slightly.

<h3 id="e89">Amidst the Fierce European War, the Gold Market Instead Falls, Bills of Exchange Frequently Loosen, and Buying Households Are Helpless, Returning to Within the 7,000 Yuan Mark <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's open market cash gold market in this city was barely satisfactory. Based on the trend after the closing price the night before, everyone expected a certain rise, but unexpectedly, the gold market's falling trend reignited yesterday, returning to within the 7,000 yuan mark. It was truly unexpected amidst the intensification of the European war and the invasion of the Netherlands and Belgium. The real reason was the rumor that the U.S. dollar might devalue, as well as the flow of funds from European belligerent countries to Shanghai, and the fact that Chinese and Western merchants were running on Dutch and Belgian banks, transferring deposits to American banks, and that some were dumping English and American exchange rates on the black market, causing English and American exchange rates to loosen sharply. Everyone's mood turned soft again. The market opened low at 7,050 yuan in the morning. Subsequently, buying interest was once strong, soaring to a high of 7,130 yuan, but the foreign exchange rate was loosening greatly, and the securities firms were selling, so buying households were helpless, resulting in a tragic fall. The price dropped to a low of 6,870 yuan. Near noon, following the recovery of the foreign exchange rate, the price recovered to the 7,000 yuan mark, and the closing price was 6,970 yuan, a decrease of 120 yuan. The afternoon was a regular Saturday holiday. The total trading volume for the first half of the day was 3,000 taels. Ornamental gold also decreased by ten yuan, to 710 yuan. Customs gold, etc., were all flat.</p>
<p>Open Market Plunges 120 Yuan</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the morning, each bar (ten taels), initially because the foreign exchange rate had stopped tightening and had loosened, the sellers initially shouted 7,120 yuan, but there were no buyers, so the price fell sharply. At the 9:30 opening, the securities firm sold 30 taels of gold at a price of 7,050 yuan, which was 40 yuan lower. Silver shops, money exchange businesses, retail investors, etc., all came to buy, causing the price to soar 80 yuan to 7,100 yuan. Silver shops bought dozens of taels of gold, raising the price to 7,130 yuan. The foreign exchange rate was reported to be loosening, and there were rumors that buyers were unwilling to buy. The two gold shops and the securities firms and money exchange businesses unanimously sold, and buyers waited and watched, so the price fell 260 yuan. A gold shop sold dozens of taels to a certain money shop, lowering the price to a low of 6,870 yuan. After 11 o'clock, the exchange market stopped loosening, and the gold shops and securities firms bought again, and the short sellers bought to cover their positions, so the price gradually rose 130 yuan. A gold shop bought dozens of taels from a silver shop, raising the price to the 7,000 yuan mark. Then it fell again. Finally, the gold shop sold 30 taels to the securities firm, and the noon closing price was 6,970 yuan, which was 120 yuan lower than the evening closing price of the previous day. There was a fluctuation of 260 yuan in the first half of the day. The afternoon was a regular Saturday delivery holiday, and there were no reports of trading outside the market. The selling price of cash gold shops was ten yuan higher than the brand name gold price, and the buying price was twenty yuan lower than the selling price. There was no change in the current margin, and the price was sixty yuan lower than the brand name gold price.</p>
<p>Ornamental Gold Also Decreases by a Small Amount</p>
<p>The selling price of jewelry gold per tael in jewelry stores also fell. Datong Hang and Xin Tong Hang initially still listed 720 yuan, but at 10:40 it fell by ten yuan, and at 11:10 it fell by ten yuan again, retreating to 700 yuan. Then, at 11:20, it rose again by ten yuan to 710 yuan (buying price reduced by 20-30 yuan), a decrease of ten yuan overall.</p>

<p>London, 10th: A telegram reports that the silver market in London saw near and forward prices remain stable overall. There was buying of forward contracts from India, but limited trading activity. The market conditions were stable, and at closing, the market remained calm with buyers present at listed prices, but sellers were holding back.

<p>The rapid advance and retreat in the yarn market is alarming. However, speculators are generally enthusiastic and highly spirited. The market opened strong due to the German invasion of the Netherlands and Belgium, with strong buying pressure. However, upon news of currency stabilization, a selling wave resurged, causing the market to rapidly decline. The price difference between the opening and closing prices was over 100 yuan.</p>
<p>Spot yarn opened this morning with strong buying sentiment from the previous afternoon. The price for 20-count Double Horse yarn was initially quoted at 1,725 yuan, rising to 1,755 yuan. Shortly after, news of a long US dollar position, falling gold prices, and no movement in spot yarn business caused a sudden decline, dropping to 1,645 yuan, with reports of no bids at times. Half-day transaction volume was estimated at 1,665 bales, with the price of 20-count Double Horse yarn rising by 20 yuan. Today, 705 pieces of yarn were shipped to Hong Kong, and 60 pieces were shipped to Tianjin. The amounts of yarn from various sources, excluding actual figures, are listed below:</p>

<h3 id="e92">Foreign Cotton Plummets - Spot Prices in the City Rise <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Trading in local cotton is scarce, but there is still buying and selling of American and Indian cotton. At the same time, Qingdao's demand for Le cotton remains healthy. As for prices, market sentiment is stable despite the large drop in Indian and American cotton markets. The details of spot cotton transactions are listed below.</p>
<p>Another report indicates that foreign cotton prices in the New York cotton market opened weakly, falling by over ten points. Later, due to speculative selling, the deteriorating European situation, and selling by overseas cotton merchants, the market was unusually chaotic. As a result, closing prices were forty points lower for near-term contracts and thirty points lower for distant Saint cotton compared to the previous day. The Indian cotton market plummeted eighteen rupees yesterday due to the German invasion of the Netherlands and Belgium, which led to the cancellation of Indian cotton purchases by those countries, combined with weak demand from the Far East. A rebound of three rupees is predicted. Egyptian cotton fell by over twenty points.</p>
<p>Due to the deteriorating European situation and increasing transportation difficulties, spot transactions for foreign cotton in Shanghai are unusually good. However, prices have risen despite the decline in overseas cotton markets. Tianjin merchants are actively buying, and most of the spot cotton in the market has been purchased. According to current trends, transit goods will likely follow suit. The cotton market prices for yesterday, converted at a rate of 4.5625 yuan per US dollar for factory delivery, are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e93">Securities - Limited Trading in Domestic Bonds <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>The securities and unofficial currency markets remained indecisive yesterday, unable to rise or fall significantly, and the market remained stagnant. Whenever buying interest increased slightly, sellers could always supply enough to meet demand. However, sellers were unwilling to lower prices, and buyers were naturally unwilling to bid up in such an environment. As a result, the market became increasingly stagnant, and trading volume decreased. Speculators had no opportunity, so they sought other avenues. Very few customers participated in the market, except for a few loyal participants. As a result, it was difficult for the market to rise or fall significantly. Yesterday's transactions were almost entirely internal among securities firms. Those with ample funds bought slightly, while those in need of funds sold slightly. Although credit conditions were slightly looser, there were still more sellers, resulting in only minor fluctuations of a few cents. The trading volume was around 400,000 to 500,000 yuan. A brief summary is listed below.</p>
<p>The stock transaction included 20 shares of the Third People's Factory, priced at 16.50 yuan.</p>
<p>London, 10th (Friday): Today's stock market listing for British Far East companies saw mixed gains and losses. The shares of Mercantile Bank of India fell 5 shillings to £9 5s. The English-registered shares of Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation remained unchanged at £92, while the Hong Kong-registered shares rose £1 to £93. Kaiping Mines shares fell 1 shilling and 4 pence to 19 shillings, with other stocks unchanged.</p>
<p>London, 10th (Friday): Today's Chinese foreign debt market was uniformly weak by £1, influenced by the German invasion of the Netherlands and Belgium. Please refer to the market price section for the details.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Grains - Purchasing for the Dragon Boat Festival - Glutinous Rice Sales Exceptionally Strong - Prices Rise Another Two Yuan - Both Indica and Japonica Rice Also Rise <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Low prices for domestic glutinous rice have led to large-scale stockpiling. Floating capital continues to buy, while pastry shops and restaurants are also actively procuring supplies in anticipation of the upcoming Dragon Boat Festival. As a result, what was once considered unwanted has suddenly become a highly sought-after commodity, causing those holding inventory to become exceptionally excited and take advantage of the opportunity to raise prices. With frequent inquiries, prices have risen repeatedly. While the market stabilized slightly near noon as rice consumption steadied, the resulting sales prices were still around two yuan higher than the previous session. Liyang "True Special" glutinous rice reached a peak of 45 yuan in the whole city, but the actual price was 44 yuan. Jintan goods were 43-44 yuan, and Changzhou/Danyang goods ranged from 41 to 42 yuan. Even low-quality rice required 40 yuan.</p>
<p>It is rumored that the dark market price for domestic thick-skinned Japonica rice remains firm due to limited arrivals, and sales are quite brisk, with prices increasing by nearly one yuan. Wuxi Special Clear Rough Rice is 51 yuan, Powder Japonica is 50 yuan, Changshu Japonica is 50 yuan, second quality is 48-49 yuan, Qingpu Special Thin Indica Rice is 51-50 yuan, general market is 48-49 yuan, and Nanxiang early rice is 48.5-48 yuan.</p>
<p>Since rising sharply the day before, foreign rice continued its momentum yesterday, with sentiment remaining firm. Those holding inventory were holding back, while those procuring supplies showed strong interest. Not only were actual sales strong, but those who had previously retreated from the market seemed to be active again in the shadows. This situation caused a new wave in the previously recovering foreign rice market. In the morning, prices for all types of goods surged by one yuan in an instant, and the calling prices continued to rise. For example, No. 1 Saigon reached 52 yuan, and Small Mark was 49 yuan. However, the high prices made actual sales difficult, so the market softened after the initial surge. These prices were not realized, and speculators, lacking a basis for trading, shifted with the wind, throwing out profitable goods. This led to more sellers than buyers, and the market returned to a soft state, with No. 1 Saigon opening at 51.5 yuan and Small Mark at 48.5 yuan. After this back and forth, the market hovered, with little change until closing, with only minor fluctuations of two or three cents. According to statistics, the city's closing price was still about 0.5-1 yuan higher than the previous session.</p>
<p>Another report states that foreign rice continued to rise again yesterday. The market opened in the morning with the momentum from the previous day's rise, and buying interest was extremely strong. Selling prices for all varieties rose almost one yuan across the board. Some large players profited and sold off in the morning, and the market leveled off by half a yuan at noon. However, in the afternoon, due to international changes and fluctuations in the gold market, the market shape rose again. Small Mark rice saw the most active trading, opening at 49-49.2 yuan in the morning and briefly falling to 48.2 yuan at noon. In the afternoon, it surged from 49.3 to 49.7 yuan, closing back down to 49.2-49.3 yuan. The original packaging of No. 2 Saigon spot goods was particularly strong. Since the transit goods had arrived completely and future transactions were not profitable, the new arrivals were mostly drawn and paid for in cash by various groups. Therefore, the price reached 61.7-61.8 yuan in the morning and surged to 62.2 yuan in the afternoon, an increase of 1.5 yuan compared to the previous day. The total transaction volume for the day was over 300. Spot goods, excluding direct bulk purchases, amounted to 7,000 bags.</p>
<p>The Wuxi rice market suffered greatly from the sudden reduction in foreign exchange rates in Shanghai, but fortunately, rice boats from various places arrived continuously, and warehouse owners sold off their stocks, so the market price remained stable. Recently, rice milling companies have been ordering large quantities from Japanese merchants, and daily purchases have been substantial. Furthermore, Japanese transportation companies are involved in the transport, and rice merchants are actively collecting and hoarding, causing the market price to firm up. High-quality White Japonica has risen to 30.5 yuan, White Sheep Point has risen from around 30 yuan to 34 yuan, and Japonica rice has reached 15 yuan. White Japonica sold in stores is 31 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Limited Development in Flour and Wheat <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>The flour market is unremarkable, and the market is as mediocre as ever. The price of No. 2 flour factory is stable and unchanged. Returned goods of the old brand are still priced at 14.1 yuan, and the price of Double Lion brand flour in mainland China is 14 yuan, both similar to the previous day. The total retail transaction volume in the city is 5,000 bags, and occasional bulk purchases are only a small number of 1,000-2,000 bags. As the recent financial storm has subsided and rice prices are unlikely to rise further, the prospects for flour and wheat are unlikely to improve significantly.</p>
<p>Furthermore, 10,000 bags of flour will be shipped to Tianjin today (12th), and another 7,500 bags will be shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Flour is currently not allowed to be exported from Wuxi, and the price of flour is hovering around 13 yuan. Sales to Taiwan have decreased, and there are still two months until the new flour season. The existing inventory is over 50,000 bags, barely enough to meet local demand.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Oil Cakes - Shantou Procures Bean Cakes <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's bean cake market was reactivated by inquiries from Shantou merchants, and prices rose by one or two cents compared to the 10th. A large transaction of 8,800-9,000 pieces of Sze Yu Factory brand cake was made, priced at 11.1 yuan to 11.15 yuan. In addition, 1,000 pieces of Sing Kee cake from the Tung Sang Factory in Pudong were transacted, priced at 10.07 yuan. A forward contract for six cartloads of Fei-character cake from the Puli Factory in Changzhou, to be delivered in the first half of June, was priced at 11 yuan. Although the outbound trade seems lively, the lack of available shipping space to Shantou makes it difficult to secure large quantities. However, profitable sales are frequently made in the market.</p>
<p>Today (12th), 4,825 cans of crude oil, 1,820 bags of soybeans, and 100 bags of shelled peanuts will be shipped to Hong Kong. Another 1,960 bags of soybeans will be shipped to Tianjin.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Silk and Tea - Sudden Rise in Silk Prices in Japan and the US - Local Sentiment Also Optimistic <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Silk prices abroad have risen sharply. Yokohama spot prices rose 95 yuan, forward prices rose 68 yuan, New York near-term prices rose 27 cents, and forward prices rose 25.5 cents, driven by the expansion of the European war.</p>
<p>In the local silk market, sentiment is rising, and asking prices are exorbitant, making it practically impossible to determine a market price. As a result, silk transactions are stagnant. Foreign firms and silk merchants are waiting to see the market situation on Monday before making further decisions.</p>
<p>Today (12th), 84 cases of tea will be shipped to Hong Kong, and 365 cases will be shipped to Tianjin.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Sugar Market - Sugar Prices Soar - 5,000 Bags of Coarse White Sugar Offered <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, Taikoo Company offered 5,000 bags of coarse granulated sugar for immediate delivery, priced at 5.31 Dutch guilders C.I.F. The association's market trend was upward. The spot price for 24 coarse white sugar in local warehouses suddenly rose from 79 yuan to 80.5 yuan. The opening price in foreign warehouses was 77 yuan, rising to 80.4 yuan, an increase of 5.5 yuan. Later, the asking price was 82 yuan. Transshipment goods were 62-65 yuan, up 3.5 yuan. Taikoo Cart White B-mark in Western warehouses was 90-91 yuan, up 4 yuan. HX-mark was 90 yuan, H-mark Cart Raw Sugar new goods were 65 yuan, up 2 yuan. Dutch Raw Sugar spot goods were 69 yuan, up 2.5 yuan, transshipment goods were 58 yuan. Local factory Snow White was 80 yuan, up 5 yuan. Local Rock Sugar was 97 yuan, Crystal Clear Rock Sugar was 98.5 yuan, both up 6.5 yuan. Domestic sugar offered Hainan Raw Sugar about 350 bags, priced at 56-56.5 yuan, Haikou foreign sugar about 100 bags, 69.5-70 yuan, Huizhou foreign sugar 20 bags, 75 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Piece Goods - Shen Weaving Woolen Fabrics and Serge - Most Prices Reported Higher <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>The domestically produced woolen fabrics, serge, linings, and other products from Shen Weaving Factory have been selling well in recent years. Although their prices have risen, they are still cheaper than imported goods. Moreover, their patterns and colors can be changed at any time, so they are welcomed and actively promoted by buyers from both local and outport areas. Since the sharp changes in foreign exchange rates last week, the prices of various raw materials have generally risen. Therefore, the factory plans to raise prices again, especially for camel silk brocade and riding breeches, which have increased the most, rising from 21 yuan to 26 yuan per yard. The fixed deposit has been changed from 20 yuan to 50 yuan per piece, to prevent speculation by small trading houses. General camel wool factories such as Wei Lun, Wei Yi, Tian Xiang, and small lining weaving houses such as Yin Feng, Xin Ji, Yong Cheng, Zheng Lun, Bao Chang, Bao Kang, Shi Xin, Mei Xin, Jin Yuan, Hong Sheng, Da Tong, and Dao Hua are also following suit by increasing the fixed deposit by two-thirds. The prices of various goods are also being increased due to the rising cost of raw materials.</p>
<p>Furthermore, 595 pieces of cotton cloth will be shipped to Hong Kong today (12th), and another 30 pieces will be shipped to Tianjin.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Seafood - Weak Inventory of Shrimp Tails - Continued Rise of Five Yuan for Western Dried Mussels <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Domestic shrimp tails are becoming increasingly scarce, leading to lively trading and strong prices. The current market price for Tianjin opening lamb is 200 yuan, Wenzhou tails are 170-180 yuan, and Western goods Jinshan tails are 400 yuan for the fourth batch. However, some shipments with unsettled exchange rates would cost as much as 600 yuan. Tian flat tails have been raised to 250-260 yuan. Inventory is low across the board, and the market is expected to remain firm.</p>
<p>There have been continuous transactions in Siamese dried mussels in recent days, but the inventory is rare. The current market price is 195 yuan, up five yuan from before.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Medicine - Sales of Galangal Revitalize, Prices Rise by Four to Five Dollars at Each Shop <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the sales of galangal have revitalized. Furthermore, the exchange rate has suddenly tightened. As this commodity requires payment of foreign taxes in Shanghai, and due to the increase in customs duties, the cost has become even higher. Consequently, the prices have risen by four to five dollars at various shops. If sales continue to be smooth in the future, further price increases are expected.</p>

<h3 id="e102">Cannibalism on an Island <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>There is an island called Niuqi Island in the South Sea, located southeast of China, and north of Australia, a British territory also known as New Gold Mountain by the Chinese. Most of the island’s inhabitants are fierce and uncivilized, comparable to the indigenous people of Taiwan. People from New Gold Mountain have repeatedly tried to trade on the island but have been harmed. Previously, a ship from Gutangbu arrived at a small island. A Chinese sailor fell ill and was left there with a young Englishman as a companion. The ship then sailed along the coast and disappeared without a trace. Later, another ship arrived. The Chinese sailor had recovered and, along with the young Englishman, boarded the ship to the island. They happened to meet some islanders who knew a bit about reason. They inquired about the previous ship, and the islanders said that six members of the cannibal tribe on the island had eaten the crew. They pointed out the location of the tribe. The ship sailed along the coast and saw the cannibals gathered in one place. From a distance, they questioned them, and the cannibals admitted to eating people. They showed the bones and said, "When we meet you white people, how can we not fill our bellies?" The ship knew it was difficult to argue with them and dejectedly returned. All Western countries deeply despise such brutality, which often leads to discord between countries. Taking China as an example, when the Englishman Margary was killed by the natives of Tengyue, it almost led to war. When the Ryukyuans were killed by the Taiwanese natives, Japan, imitating the West, groundlessly provoked conflict. Now, the Niuki Island cannibals have harmed Englishmen to such an extent, but we have not heard of sending troops to punish them. Why is that? Perhaps because the area has severe miasma, making it impossible to do anything. So, the friendship of friendly nations is no match for the threat of miasma. Alas!</p>

<p>All mothers want their children to be good people. Sometimes, fathers overlook their children's faults, but mothers see them clearly. Mothers have an instinct to detect moral dangers, and their influence on justice is greater than all laws, education, and teachers. Of course, there are some evil-hearted mothers in the world, like Jezebel of ancient times, and some base, heartless mothers who sell their sons and daughters. However, these are exceptional cases and do not deserve the name of mother. From ancient times, there have been many virtuous mothers like Hannah, who dedicated her son to God as soon as he was born. Lincoln said, "Everything I am now, and everything I hope to be, I owe to my angel mother." (II) "Mother" suggests the service of believers. A mother's sacrifice and devotion to her children perfectly exemplify the ideal service of believers. Today, many fashionable women want to escape the responsibility of being a mother and go out into society. In reality, from the perspective of children, there is no greater career in the world than being a mother. Mothers bravely shoulder their heavy burdens and patiently endure their pain, just like teachers who are martyred for the Lord, who do not hesitate to go through fire and water, worthy of respect and admiration. Someone gave a speech on Mother's Day, saying, "When we think of our mothers, we should remember their selfless, unlimited, and steadfast love. Whether circumstances are good or bad, her love grows brighter with each passing day. She does not expect anything in return, only that we become superior people. Even if we are unworthy and fail to live up to her expectations, she still loves us unfailingly. Mothers are truly wonderful, eternal, and incomprehensible!" Whether a mother's life is in vain depends entirely on us. If we abandon ourselves to depravity and do not think of redemption, our mother's sacrifice is wasted. Therefore, we must honor our mothers, do good deeds in their name, and bring glory to our mothers. (III) "Mother" suggests heaven. Mothers are the head and queen of the family. A family cannot be a family without a mother. Someone asked a child, "Where is your home?" The child replied, "My home is where my mother is." This is the truth. The Christian concept of heaven is also a perfect family. Only when we measure our lives with this attitude are we fit to be children of heaven. (The End)</p>

<h3 id="e104">Do You Love Your Mother? <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>— Xin Liang</p>
<p>Children, you probably all know that May 8th is International Mother's Day. From carrying you for ten months to raising you to adulthood, your mothers have spent so much thought and suffered so much pain. Now, most of you are studying in school. When you come home for lunch, the dishes are prepared and waiting for you on the table. After school, there are always words of comfort. But have you ever thought about "loving" your mother? "Mother" is the greatest person in the world, but have you ever thought about how to repay her?</p>
<p>We should all love our mothers. Here, I want to say a few words. I hope that after reading this, you can each ask yourselves if you have reached this point. Only then can you be said to not have wasted this precious mother.</p>
<p>First, I believe that loving our mothers should be expressed through action. In other words, we should have real work to show for it. Accept your mother's good words and resolve to be an ambitious child. For example, Yue Fei put "serving the country with utmost loyalty" into practical action, becoming a patriotic man. Not only is he admired throughout history, but his mother is also praised by us. I think every mother hopes that you can make a great career, just like Yue Fei's mother. So why don't you start working hard from today?</p>
<p>Secondly, in addition to setting a big goal, you should study as hard as possible right now. You must know that life is difficult these days, and it is not easy for parents to earn a few dollars. You are still young and cannot help with the family burden, but you should work hard in your position. If you can get a free education, wouldn't your mother be overjoyed? In addition, you should save all pocket money. You must know that when your mother has no change, and you run up to ask her for money, how sad she will feel!</p>
<p>If your mother is unfortunately no longer with you, then you should work harder and strive to be a good child, so as not to fail the hard work your mother put into raising you.</p>
<p>Please remember, dear children, let us "love" our mothers! Let us "love" our mothers with practical efforts. Every mother is waiting for your success.</p>
<h3 id="e105">How to Repay Your Mother? <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Chunlu</p>
<p>Children! Who gave birth to you? Of course, it is your mother. Who raised you? It is also your mother. When you see the little brothers and sisters in swaddling clothes, crying for food, and babbling, you will definitely remember how your mother raised you to adulthood.</p>
<p>In the world, all mothers love their children. Their love for their children is meticulous. Then, how can children not respect their mothers and be filial to them?</p>
<p>The fourth day was Mother's Day. At that time, children all over the world were sincerely and innocently blessing their mothers! I know that you, who have always loved your mothers, will be even more pious.</p>
<p>However, how can we bless our mothers and repay their kindness? The only thing children can do to repay their mothers is to listen to their words, not make them angry; help their mothers with housework at home, take care of their younger siblings, and share some of the hard work; study hard at school, exercise, and prepare to serve the country in the future. In this way, mothers will have hope for the youth of the future, and even though they have worked hard, they will feel supremely gratified.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Silk Worms <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>— Su Ming</p>
<p>The weather is gradually warming up. Yong'er's memory is truly good; he still remembers the paper with silkworm moth eggs from last year, placed in the corner of his drawer. He wrapped it in cotton, and because of the warm weather, countless small, maggot-like black silkworms hatched in just a few days. So, besides studying, Yong'er spent all his time caring for the silkworms.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, getting some mulberry leaves to feed silkworms is not an easy task. Yong'er's house is already very cramped; where would there be space to plant mulberry trees? So he had to exchange his beloved silkworms with classmates who had mulberry leaves, and also inquire everywhere, begging people for some silkworm food. After eating the mulberry leaves, the silkworms gradually grew bigger, and the small black bodies slowly turned greyish-white, and their bodies unknowingly stretched out quite a bit. This made Yong'er very happy, but the silkworms' food also increased accordingly.</p>
<p>"How annoying! Where are we going to get mulberry leaves? Why not just throw them away?" Mother, seeing that Yong'er had neglected his studies since he started raising silkworms, and that he always came home from school with some mulberry leaves in his hands, dropping his bag as soon as he got home and immediately going outside to find mulberry leaves, with the silkworms' food always on his mind, said this. "Mom, don't throw them away. If there aren't enough mulberry leaves, raising silkworms is a good animal experiment and you can gain a lot of living knowledge. It's a pity people don't pay attention to it," Ming'er interjected.</p>
<p>"Is that what you call living knowledge?" Yong'er didn't understand.</p>
<p>Ming'er then put a silkworm in his palm and pointed, saying, "A silkworm is the larva of a silkworm moth. In terms of appearance, it can be divided into three parts: head, thorax, and abdomen. The head is very small with a pair of fine hairy antennae, and each side has six extremely tiny eyes, but unfortunately, our naked eyes cannot see them. When they grow up, I can point them out to you. The thorax is made up of three body segments, and has three pairs of legs. The abdomen has ten segments and five pairs of legs, with the last pair called caudal feet. On the eighth segment of the abdomen, there is a raised thing called the caudal horn. There are also nine pairs of spiracles on the body for breathing, eight pairs on the sides of the abdomen, and one pair on the side of the thorax. The silkworm's body is very soft and has no internal skeleton. The body is only covered with a hard cuticle, which serves as its exoskeleton. However, this exoskeleton cannot grow with the body, so the silkworm must undergo four molts before it can spin a cocoon. It also has a mouth, but it's hard to see. Inside the body, there are circulatory, respiratory, excretory, and sensory organs. As the saying goes, 'Though the body is small, it has all five internal organs.' Even more peculiar about the silkworm's body is that on both sides of the stomach, there are silk glands. The secretions from these glands are expelled from the small holes in the mouth, and when they encounter air, they harden into silk. When a silkworm hatches from an egg, its body is greyish-yellow and hairy. After molting, the hair falls off, and it slowly turns light blue. After four molts, it grows fully and then spins a cocoon to hide its body inside, then molts again into a pupa. After a few days, the pupa molts again and turns into a silkworm moth, breaking out of the cocoon. That is the silkworm moth. All this is living knowledge. Mulberry leaves are the only food for silkworms, but three years ago, a Japanese agricultural doctor used the leaves of various plants to feed silkworms. As a result, he discovered a new method: discarding mulberry leaves for wormwood leaves. The silkworms raised with this method are exactly the same as those fed with mulberry leaves. You might as well try it. If it succeeds, the mulberry leaf problem can be solved. Using wormwood leaves to feed silkworms is a novel thing that has never been heard of before."</p>
<h3 id="e107">Monkeys and Peaches <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>— He Gongchao</p>
<p>New Fable</p>
<p>There were three monkeys, chased by hunters to the riverbank. The river was deep and wide, and they didn't know how to swim. It was a dire situation. Fortunately, on each bank of the river, there was a peach tree, and the branches of the two trees were very close. In their desperation, they came up with an idea. They joined hands with each other, and one of them grabbed the branch on this bank. One, two, three, everyone swung together. The monkey at the bottom swung across the river, grabbing the branch on the opposite bank. Then, the monkeys on this bank let go, and all three monkeys reached the other side. They swung back and forth leisurely under the branches, making the hunter, who had just arrived at the bank, gnash his teeth in hatred.</p>
<p>But there was a large, red peach hanging on the branch. The monkey holding the branch wanted to eat the peach, so he released the hands of his two companions. The other two monkeys fell to the ground together. The selfish monkey picked the peach and started munching on it. But how could the other two monkeys let it go? They immediately climbed up together and wrestled into a ball.</p>
<p>The hunter had already given up hope of crossing the river, but seeing the monkeys fighting each other, he crossed the river. He opened the door of the cage specifically for monkeys and waited quietly. Soon, the monkeys, bruised and exhausted from the fight, fell from the tree one by one. The hunter effortlessly caught them one by one and put them in the cage.</p>
<p>The ancients said, "It is easy to share adversity, but difficult to share prosperity." This is absolutely correct.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Shirley Temple's Autobiography (2) <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>— Min</p>
<p>Kagan, this corridor is a very nice place, and I often play there. It's like a cool, lovely garden inside the house. In the center, there's a goldfish pond and a banana tree with real bananas growing on it. Along the sides, there are various cacti arranged one after another. Of course, I can't roll around on the grass because the ground is covered with brown tiles and there's no grass. When I play in the corridor, people on the street can't see me, which is the best thing.</p>
<p>Kagan, you know, if you become a movie star, people often want to see what you look like. They also want to get close to you, shake your hand, pat your head, ask you if you have any thoughts, and take out pieces of paper for you to sign your name. Sometimes, they even suddenly stretch out their arms to hug you and kiss you!</p>
<p>Kagan, that's why I think playing in this enclosed corridor is much better than in a public garden. I remember when I first got a tricycle, it was so much fun. My brother Jack—he's twenty-one now and six feet two inches tall—he said it wasn't a two-wheeled bicycle but a tricycle because it had three wheels. Back then, I rode the tricycle on the paths in our old garden, spinning around and feeling so happy. Those paths were narrow, just wide enough for two parallel wheels. If I rode too fast, I'd fall into Mom's flowerbeds, or I'd fall into the ditch next to it.</p>
<p>Even though I didn't leave the garden, I once took a long trip. I pedaled the tricycle to the end of the garden, to the eucalyptus trees, and imagined I was in Erie, Pennsylvania, where Dad lived when he was little. The next day, I went to Chicago, which is Mom's hometown. You know, Dad and Mom were very young when they came to California. They met here and later got married at home.</p>
<p>Kagan, I also want to tell you that our old house was in Santa Monica. This town is very close to Beverly Hills and Hollywood. When you look, you only see houses connected and streets connected. You would think it was one town. If you can tell which street is the beginning and which street is the end, then you're really smart. Actually, Santa Monica, Beverly Hills, and Hollywood are different because it's closest to the beach, and beyond that is the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>From our old house, you could go straight to the beach, and from our new house, you can also go straight there. You know, we still live in Santa Monica, not far from where we used to live, but the environment is a little different. To get to the beach, you can take Mom's new car, and it's very fast, but we don't go there much anymore because I'm too busy at the studio. When I'm not filming movies, I have to go to school. Oh, not really going to school, but Miss Bicknell teaches me to read and write in my bungalow at the studio. I'll tell you about those things in detail later.</p>

<h3 id="e109">Farewell to Shirley Temple <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>— Xin Liang</p>
<p>The news that Shirley Temple is about to retire from the screen has been reported before. This truly makes us both surprised and happy. We are surprised because from now on, we will no longer see Shirley's films. However, we also feel very happy because she can concentrate on her studies. Given her level of intelligence, we are confident that her achievements in her studies will be as great as her achievements in movies.</p>
<p>Her eleventh birthday—April 23rd—just passed, and news comes that she is leaving the film industry. Perhaps she had already planned not to continue filming this year. Some say: Shirley Temple is already eleven years old! The period of child stardom has passed, so if she doesn't leave the screen now, she may face a significant decline in the near future. Here, we won't ask what her fate will be. For a young girl to have such acting skills and such success, in anyone's eyes, this is not an easy thing! From the age of three until today, in between, she must have earned a lot of money and moved countless men and women around the world. Of course, we have to admit that she is a smart girl and a talented little star.</p>
<p>Now, Shirley is going to study, and we all wish her: that she will have the same success in her studies. Shirley, work hard! We like to see your superb, lively acting skills in the film, but we also like to see your report card in school be full of "firsts." Work hard!

<p>— Hai Xing</p>
<p>The formation of a troupe by Peking Opera star Yu Sulian and others to perform in other places is quite noteworthy. Although Yu Sulian is the leading figure in the troupe, the backbone is actually someone else. They have been working hard behind the scenes for more than a year and have even organized a small library. They regularly explore theatrical theories and have adapted many new and old scripts. Now that the time is ripe, they are taking steps to materialize their plans. Yu Sulian is also happy to join. Thus, the troupe is formally announced. The first step is to perform in Ningbo. If the results are good, they will go to Yunnan, Guangxi, and other places to perform. All the scripts performed are newly written or adapted, totaling more than a dozen. For example, "Liang Hongyu," "The Fisherman's Lament," "The Peach Blossom Fan," and "Zhu Xian Town" will all be staged. The entire troupe is small, with only thirty-odd members. In addition to performing on stage, each person must also take on backstage duties. Items such as large wardrobe trunks and prop boxes are all provided by the troupe itself. Such an organization is similar to a drama troupe, which is rare in the Peking Opera scene. Although their future is still unknown, their spirit of courage and determination is commendable.</p>

<p>Man'er Oubailang's latest masterpiece, "The Fairy Couple in the Moon Palace," is now showing at the Nanjing Theatre. The entire film is produced in stereoscopic color, with scenes including the snow-capped mountains of Switzerland, the ancient ruins of Rome, and the canals of Venice. All the famous mountains and rivers of Europe are captured in colorful shots, making it very beautiful. The plot is tortuous and interesting, which can lead the audience to relax. At the same time, it is quite satirical, which is the great success of this movie.</p>

<h3 id="e113">Germany Invades Holland, Belgium, and Luxembourg: Luxembourg in the South, Netherlands in the North <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>— Yushan</p>
<p>Germany's Goal</p>
<p>The long-rumored German attempt to invade Holland and Belgium has finally become a reality with the German army and air force crossing the borders of Holland and Belgium, and the German navy landing in The Hague. The war has expanded from Northern Europe to Western Europe. Germany's military action directly targets the three countries of Holland, Belgium, and Luxembourg, while its indirect targets are naturally the Allied powers of Britain and France, which stand behind these countries. Because Germany, by passing through the Netherlands and Belgium, attacks the side of France, not only does France's Maginot Line lose its effectiveness, but also Germany, after occupying Belgium and the Netherlands as a base for the air force, shortens the distance between the German and British air forces, and can use these areas to attack London and British merchant ships in the English Channel, so that Britain's naval blockade may be hit by the threat of airplanes above and submarines below. This is what Britain and France are most concerned about regarding Germany's violation of the neutrality of Holland, Belgium, and Luxembourg.</p>
<p>Lessons from the Last World War</p>
<p>Furthermore, judging from the experiences of the last World War, although the route of this invasion is different from the past, it seems that it has not forgotten the old battlefield where the main German forces borrowed this invasion to attack Belgium and Luxembourg in the previous World War. In the last World War, Germany concentrated seven corps on the French border. The Sixth and Seventh Corps under the command of Prince Rupprecht of Bavaria and General Halingen were concentrated at Strasbourg and attacked the Moselle River. The other five corps implemented Schlieffen's famous flanking strategy, borrowed from Belgium, enveloped the French flanks, and defeated the French army. The Fifth Corps, commanded by the German Crown Prince, was concentrated in Trier and Saarbrücken, passing through Luxembourg and the French territories of Longwy and Romagne, and moving southwest towards Verdun, France, in a short, arc-shaped line. The Fourth Corps, under the command of Duke Albrecht of Württemberg, took an even larger detour, passing through Luxembourg and targeting Châlons-en-Champagne in France. The Third Corps, commanded by General Hausen, and the Second Corps, commanded by General Bülow, passed through Liège, Namur, and Mons in Belgium and joined the First Corps in France to cut off the junction of the British and French forces, forcing the French troops to retreat to the suburbs of Paris, surrounding them, and achieving the goal of a swift and decisive victory. Due to Belgium's resistance, the delay in time, and the relative weakness of the forces, the flanks of the First Corps were exposed, and the plan to take Paris within twenty-six days did not come to fruition.</p>
<p>The Old Methods of the Last World War</p>
<p>There are clearly differences in this war on the Franco-Belgian border. France has built the Maginot Line on the front, and its fortifications are much stronger than before, and the Belgian border adjacent to it has the same fortifications as France. Therefore, launching a flanking war from Ansen in Germany and invading Belgium to copy the old article is no longer applicable because times have changed. However, its invasion of Luxembourg still shows that it is still playing the old methods of the last World War to some extent. However, the French troops in the Maginot Line will also rush out of the trenches and enter Luxembourg to assist the country. The trench warfare in Western Europe may end as a result, turning into the prelude to a great war between Britain and France and Germany in Luxembourg.</p>
<p>Germany Avoids the Strong and Attacks the Weak</p>
<p>Germany's attack on Luxembourg may be easier than in Belgium, because Belgium is much stronger than Holland and Luxembourg in national defense construction. France's western front has the Maginot Line, and Belgium's western front also has the "Little Maginot Line." This line was created under the guidance of French engineers. There is also a new Albert Canal from Antwerp to Liège in the north, which is two hundred and fifty English feet wide and fifteen English feet deep. Its main purpose is to serve as a military obstacle. There are dense machine gun nets and powerful artillery installations along the river. In terms of military defense, Belgium in this war is clearly very different from Belgium in the last war. Judging from the situation in the last World War, Germany's Schlieffen Plan was quite successful, which was the result of Germany's unexpected attack and unpreparedness. Belgium, like the Allied forces, did not expect Germany to violate Belgium's neutrality and detour to France's flanks to attack France. This time, Belgium mobilized ten thousand troops to guard the border as soon as the war began, which is very different from the previous mobilization of forty-two thousand troops to fight against Germany. However, even with such a small army in Belgium in the last World War, it gave Germany a lot of obstacles in coping with the powerful Germany in the midst of its busyness, and gave the British and French great convenience. Judging from Belgium's full preparation this time, and the fact that the British and French forces will definitely provide substantial assistance once Germany attacks Belgium, Germany's attack on Belgium will not be as convenient as the invasion of Northern Europe, so Germany must consider it carefully and avoid the strong and attack the weak.</p>
<p>In this sense, the main route of the German army's current advance is Luxembourg in the south, which is more important, and the Netherlands in the north, which is more important. The Netherlands is far less strong than Belgium in national defense, and in terms of its position, it is the first to bear the brunt of Germany's attack. In terms of the situation, Germany's attack on the Netherlands is much easier than on Belgium. Militarily, Germany will use pressure to make the Netherlands submit. In domestic politics, Germany will also use the Dutch National Socialist Party to rebel from within in order to achieve the effect of internal and external cooperation. The latter of course depends on whether the German military can gain a foothold in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>Netherlands Strategy</p>
<p>Now Germany's attack is just beginning, and it is difficult to predict the outcome. According to the Netherlands' original national defense plan, it will wait for Germany to invade and actively resist Germany in the east. The Netherlands can mobilize 650,000 people, with Lieutenant General Reijnders as the commander-in-chief. If it loses the war, the only strategy is to breach the dikes of the Zuiderzee, let seawater in, and harass the German army, abandoning the entire northeastern territory and retreating to the triangular area of Rotterdam, Utrecht, and Amsterdam. All roads and bridges on both sides of the passage are equipped with tank obstacles, mines, and obstacles. However, all this is the previous plan. If the German army lands by sea at The Hague and seizes the western coast, as the German propaganda claims, The Hague is only a short distance from the Netherlands' last defense area, and the Netherlands' previous plan may be hindered to some extent. However, the British and French navies will also forcibly land in the Netherlands like they did in Norway to fight against Germany, or they will come from Belgium to support the Netherlands. Therefore, the future battlefield may be in a corner of the Netherlands. Germany's current attack is only the beginning. Britain and France and Germany are sharpening their swords and preparing for a great war. It is too early to make a comprehensive judgment on what the outcome of the war will be.</p>

<h3 id="e115">Han Tombs in Shaoxing <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>— Ju Chen</p>
<p>Every Mountain Has Them</p>
<p>Recently, the discovery of Han tombs on the north bank of Chongqing caused a stir, and there were some gains. This is because the capital is located there, with many talented people, archaeologists gathered, and discoveries are made. Reporters publicize them, and foreign ministers take photos and send them back to their home countries. As a result, not only the whole country knows, but the world also hears about it.</p>
<p>In fact, our great ancient country has what are called historical sites everywhere. The author is from Shaoxing. In Shaoxing, the southwest is mountainous, and Han tombs are almost everywhere on every mountain. This refers to those that have been exposed on the surface, and those that have not been exposed on the surface are probably countless. After August 13th, the author was idle in the countryside. At that time, ordinary farmers were digging up Han tombs, which they called "scouring ancient tombs." It turned out that a group of antique dealers from Shanghai were stationed locally to buy them. These simple-minded farmers wanted to find antiques and make a fortune, but the so-called "fortune" was only a few tens of yuan. Later, the county government issued a notice prohibiting it, and those who violated it were arrested. Most of them did it at night. Once, I went climbing with relatives for fun, and suddenly saw a large group of short-coated people running away with hoes. Looking closer, the ancient tomb had been more than half excavated. This was because we had lived in Shanghai for a long time, and the villagers did not recognize us, thinking we were plainclothes police.</p>
<p>The author, because the price was not expensive, also bought a little: unlettered bricks are worthless, and lettered ones are two for a dime. The so-called letters, on both sides of the brick, are the year and the name of the brick maker. I checked and found that they were from the Three Kingdoms period. What I can still remember now is one is Jiaping 3rd year, and one is Fenghuang 1st year. Jiaping was found, but Fenghuang was not found in any books (I hope readers who know can give me some guidance). There are many other years, but I can't remember them all at once (because the things are in the countryside). In a tomb, there are not many lettered bricks, most of them are unlettered. There are also swords and pottery. The swords, of course, are rusted like withered grass, but the pottery is mostly complete, including washbasins, water pitchers, animal figures, and human figures. These things are sold cheaply, and they are not the target objects of the villagers' excavation. What they hope most to find is a bronze mirror. The bronze mirrors are of different sizes. The few I have seen are about four or five inches in diameter. The bronze has turned black, like black gold, and it is shiny enough to reflect people's faces. On the back, there are protruding twelve zodiac animals.</p>

<p>Many authors, seeking a smooth flow of thoughts, often retreat to secluded islands, or reside quietly in serene studies, or climb high mountains, or visit the water's edge; some even take baths. For example, P.G. Wodehouse, when his thoughts are blocked, takes a water bath and lets the waves stimulate his inspiration.</p>
<p>Robert Louis Stevenson's works often came to him in dreams. His famous and profitable novel, "Jekyll and Hyde," originated in this way. The famous American playwright Eugene O'Neill also sketched out the outlines of his plays in his sleep. Compton Mackenzie enjoyed writing on isolated islands.</p>
<p>Many of George Bernard Shaw's plays were achieved by jotting down ideas that surfaced in streetcars and trains. Thomas Hardy admitted that he could not write with his shoes on. Longfellow wrote poetry at sunrise. Some writers even completed their famous works in balloons, like H.G. Wells. This doesn't mean he sat in a hot air balloon to write; it refers to the fact that after the original manuscript was written, Wells would use a pencil to draw many circles and add new ideas.</p>
<p>Tobacco can inspire writing; this has been true since ancient times. James Barrie had a formula: one pipe equals one idea, and half a dozen ideas make a structure. Hervey Allen, the author of "Anthony Adverse," spent four years writing the book, and he smoked a cigarette almost every sentence.</p>

<p>The average area of the face that needs shaving is forty-eight square inches. The average number of beard hairs growing on this area is 25,000. The average growth speed of each beard hair in 24 hours is one-hundredth of an inch. Therefore, the average beard growth per person per day is 250 inches. The average number of people shaving every day in England is fifteen million; therefore, the total length of beard hairs grown every day (in the three islands) is fifty thousand miles, occupying an area of one hundred twenty-five acres.</p>

<h3 id="e118">The Price Increase of National Products <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>— Baiyu</p>
<p>Since the foreign exchange contraction, the prices of various goods on the market have generally risen by several levels. The prices of domestic products have also increased, which cannot be said to be a major threat to people's lives. After the price increase of domestic products, some people may say that since they are called domestic products, they should have nothing to do with foreign exchange. Imported goods that are closely related to foreign exchange, with the foreign exchange contraction, prices skyrocketing, this is inevitable, why should domestic products follow suit? This statement seems reasonable, but it is not. Because China's heavy industry is underdeveloped, and wartime transportation is inconvenient, most of the raw materials for production rely on the supply of imported goods. In addition, Shanghai's environment is special, and the coal and electricity for all production power are also increasing in price with changes in foreign exchange. Since the cost of production has increased with the contraction of foreign exchange, the price increase of domestic products is also inevitable. Furthermore, some people say that the foreign exchange rate changed on the 2nd of this month, and domestic products raised their prices on the 3rd. This is suspected of taking advantage of the fire to loot. I certainly cannot say that there are none who hold this mentality, but the production and sales of commodities are related. When a batch of goods is sold today, a batch of raw materials must be purchased at the same time. The cost of goods already sold on the market has naturally not increased, but since the price of raw materials purchased now has increased, to avoid losses, it is not without reason to increase the price of current inventory by several levels.</p>
<p>The increase in the selling price of domestic products has a difficult reason from the perspective of domestic product factories, and from the perspective of consumers, it is also an increase in their living burden. For the sake of the producers' own interests, we certainly cannot absolutely disallow the price increase of domestic products, but for the sake of consumers' interests, we cannot but hope that domestic product producers will give sufficient consideration to the increase in the selling price of domestic products. Because the excessive price increase of domestic products following the foreign exchange contraction has the greatest impact on consumers. Increasing their burden is a small matter, but the impression that customers treat domestic products and foreign goods equally is a major obstacle to the development of domestic products. In the situation of expensive coal, expensive electricity, expensive raw materials, and expensive labor, we certainly sympathize with the increase in the selling price of domestic products, but in today's situation where the seven necessities of life are all expensive, we cannot but pay close attention to the increased burden and difficult living conditions of consumers. We must understand that engaging in production is an "investment" rather than "speculation." Since it is a legitimate investment, in order to maintain the safety of the investment and to maintain its legitimate interests, it is not too critical to take necessary measures in an era of dramatic changes in the financial market. Therefore, we not only do not oppose this price increase of domestic products, but also give it appropriate sympathy. However, while entrepreneurs take care of the safety and legitimate interests of their own investment, they must also take care of the benefits of consumers. It is not appropriate to increase the burden on consumers unless necessary, and they cannot take advantage of the opportunity to obtain greater profits, turning investment undertakings into speculative activities. We are well aware of the difficulties faced by domestic product producers at present. The increase in raw material prices is much higher than the increase in finished product prices. The price increase is really out of necessity. In order to preserve normal investment, to maintain national industry, and to take care of the suffering of the public, consumers should understand the hardships of producers and producers should understand the suffering of consumers in this era of high prices. The price increase of domestic products should be considered comprehensively. One family crying and everyone laughing is a fact that cannot be allowed, and one family laughing and everyone crying is also a fact that cannot be allowed. Today, only understanding and empathy can eliminate all misunderstandings and disputes. In the midst of this price increase of domestic products, the reporter also wishes to contribute "understanding" and "empathy" to domestic product producers and consumers.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Home Industry <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>— Jin Zhixuan</p>
<p>Home industry in China is different from home industry in other countries. China is based on agriculture. In the past, home industries were defeated by mechanized products. In recent years, the home industries that are still worth mentioning and can exchange for foreign exchange are briefly listed as follows:</p>
<p>Silkworm cocoons</p>
<p>Straw hats and straw hat braids</p>
<p>Lace and hand-woven embroidery products, towels, and jacquard small items</p>
<p>Tin foil and joss paper (mostly for superstitious beliefs of overseas Chinese)</p>
<p>Noodle powder</p>
<p>Antique-style art products</p>
<p>The main reason why the above-mentioned home industries can still exist is that Chinese people are greedy for cheapness. However, due to lack of unified leadership and lack of skills, they cannot develop day by day, and they are always in a precarious situation, so they are barely surviving. If you want to seek its development, you must proceed in two aspects: improvement and innovation:</p>
<p>The first is to improve the existing home industry to surpass others</p>
<p>The second is to create other home industries to reduce imports</p>
<p>In an industrially backward country, its people must first suffer the pain of the industrial revolution when entering an industrialized country. After it becomes an industrially developed country, it is again oppressed by the forces of capital, and the home industry changes its face even more. Although China's current home industry has not reached a strong position, it is still in a blind and free competition stage, subject to the manipulation and exploitation of residents, and its danger is less. Once a fully organized cooperative society appears, the separation of production and sales is completely eliminated, and the original social organization and the characteristics of the Chinese nation are utilized, the future is unlimited.</p>
<p>Regarding the improvement of inherent home industries, the following key points should be considered:</p>
<p>Study the sales channels and the psychology of the buyers</p>
<p>Unify the weights and measures and accurately verify them</p>
<p>Unify the raw material colors and appropriate processing</p>
<p>External propaganda, internal warnings, education, and guidance</p>
<p>Study and apply various rationalization</p>
<p>laws</p>
<p>Regarding the promotion of other home industries, the following key points should be considered:</p>
<p>Persuade housewives not to waste their time while instilling common sense in production</p>
<p>Study the advantages and disadvantages of decentralized and centralized manufacturing, improve</p>
<p>Build auxiliary factories to manufacture parts that cannot be done manually and to assemble and organize finished products</p>
<p>Study and manufacture various machines suitable for housewives</p>
<p>Study and allocate appropriate home industries to suit various local conditions</p>
<p>Publicize original characteristics and exchange production and sales opinions</p>
<p>Introduction of National Products Factories</p>
<h3 id="e120">China Chemical Industrial Society: Pioneer in Manufacturing Industrial Raw Materials, Earliest Development of the Cosmetics Industry <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>— Zhong Wangshu</p>
<p>At the beginning of the Republic of China, all undertakings showed a sign of renewal and prosperity. Mr. Fang Yexian, with his broad vision and resolute spirit, initiated and founded the China Chemical Industrial Society in Shanghai in the first year of the Republic of China. Initially, the capital was only 50,000 yuan, but now it has increased to 3 million yuan. The head office is located at 257 Henan Road, Shanghai, and the manufacturing plant is located at 150 Binlang Road, Shanghai. Distribution offices are located in major cities across the country. Its products were initially limited to cosmetics, and then gradually expanded to add various daily necessities and hygiene products, as well as industrial raw materials. In terms of sales, although the fall of some provinces and counties has resulted in the loss of many markets, the promotion of overseas business has made up for the loss and more. The factory's products, manufacturing, and worker conditions are recorded below for the readers.</p>
<p>Products</p>
<p>(1) Toothpaste and Tooth Powder Category: Samsung Toothpaste, White Jade Toothpaste, and White Jade Tooth Powder.</p>
<p>(2) Cosmetics Category: There are many items, but the most notable ones are Times Cream, Soft Snow Flower Essence, New Samsung Flower Dew Perfume, Samsung brand various hair growth lotions and hair growth oils, various fragrant powders and perfumes.</p>
<p>(3) Soap Category: Scenery Soap, Golden Rooster Soap, Zhilan Soap, High-grade Sandalwood Soap, and the recently produced Kanglei Xun Soap, etc.</p>
<p>(4) Washing Soap Category: Scissors Soap and Samsung Soap Flakes.</p>
<p>(5) Medicated Soap Category: Samsung Disinfectant Medicated Soap</p>
<p>(6) Mosquito Coil and Pharmaceutical Category: Various types of Samsung mosquito coils and Insect Enemy, Insecticide, Fly Killer, etc.</p>
<p>(7) Seasoning Category: Guanyin Powder, Delicious Essence, Wei Sheng, etc.</p>
<p>(8) Industrial Raw Material Category: Glycerin, Menthol, and Peppermint Oil, Starch and Dextrin.</p>
<p>(9) Glassware: Various glassware and self-used bottles and tubes.</p>
<p>Manufacturing</p>
<p>Because there are many types of products, they cannot be listed one by one. The following describes two types of chemical raw materials:</p>
<p>Glycerin - Raw materials: By-products of soap. Ten percent of the tallow and coconut oil used to make soap is glycerin. After adding salt to the oil, it combines with fatty acids, and glycerin is separated. Manufacturing process: 1. Neutralize with sulfuric acid or hydrochloric acid; 2. Add alum to precipitate; 3. Filter to remove impurities; 4. Vacuum evaporation; 5. Distill to become gas; 6. Bleach with activated carbon to complete pure glycerin. Uses: Cigarette factories, pharmaceutical factories, and cosmetics factories all need it, and it is the main component of explosive explosives and one of the raw materials for the military industry. Menthol - Raw materials: Peppermint oil. Manufacturing process: 1. Freeze the peppermint oil into a solid, which is crude menthol; 2. Place it in a temperature-controlled drying room to re-condense. Uses: A cooling agent in medicines.</p>
<p>Because the quality of the above two products has met the standards, in addition to self-use, they are mostly shipped to the United States and Canada, and are very reputable. This is also a glorious harvest for the export of domestic products.</p>
<p>Worker Conditions</p>
<p>The factory has a total of 700 workers, of which female workers account for one-third. During the war, prices increased, and the company, mindful of the workers' lives, increased wages and provided rice subsidies, so the relationship between labor and management was very harmonious. Because the management is well managed and the quality of exports has improved, the success of the factory is by no means accidental. Those who are engaged in the manufacture of domestic products are willing to use it as a model.</p>

<p>— Qing</p>
<p>Fire protection is a necessary facility in both the home and the community. Factories have a large number of people and many industrial raw materials are easy to catch fire, so this article briefly describes the necessary equipment, organization, and training in factories:</p>
<p>(A) Equipment</p>
<p>(1) Alarm bell or gong. Use an electric bell to reach all parts of the factory, so that each department can be immediately prepared for emergencies.</p>
<p>(2) Fire extinguisher, that is, the foam fire extinguisher sold on the market, which has the effect of rapid fire extinguishing, is not expensive, easy to use, and will not be damaged for a long time. It should also be equipped in households.</p>
<p>(3) Fire extinguishing bomb, which has the same effect as a fire extinguisher, can automatically explode to extinguish fire when the fire spreads.</p>
<p>(4) Yellow sand, that is, the yellow sand used for construction on the market, has the function of preventing the fire from spreading, especially when oil is on fire, yellow sand can be used to extinguish it.</p>
<p>(5) Tap, that is, tap water tap. For places far away from the water source, it can be connected with a belt.</p>
<p>(6) Fire engine, that is, a pump, which has both waterproofing and fire prevention functions, but small factories may not have it.</p>
<p>(7) Fire escape ladder, which varies in type depending on the location and use.</p>
<p>(8) Other clothing and tools used by firefighters.</p>
<p>(B) Organization Fire protection organization,</p>
<p>can be roughly divided into four teams</p>
<p>(1) Security team, responsible for guarding important locations to prevent bandits from taking the opportunity to rob.</p>
<p>(2) Extinguishing team, responsible for firefighting work at the fire scene.</p>
<p>(3) Carrying team, responsible for carrying out and storing important account books, objects, or documents.</p>
<p>(4) Rescue team, responsible for rescuing people who are unable to escape from the room.</p>
<p>(C) Training</p>
<p>(1) All employees of the factory should be taught to be calm in the event of an accident, and how to assist the fire brigade, and various escape methods in times of danger, so as to avoid chaos and disasters.</p>
<p>(2) The above four types of team members must be guided at any time to understand the tasks they are responsible for, how to use various machines, how to save people, how to rescue people, and how to maintain order, so that each one is familiar with the chest, and then given practice, such as arranging a hypothetical fire scene and issuing emergency signals.</p>
