<p>社評</p>
<h3 id="c10">最近之中日軍事動態 <a href="#c10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>冬末以來，各綫日軍似各有發動，而允以西南西北兩方面較為積極。桂南方面，日軍並不以屢遭重創而稍戢凶鋒，且更迂迥突圍，冒險輕進，肆擾於賓陽上林黎塘之間。綏西方面，則沿河旁山以分途進窺五臨，以迄綏寗邊境，連日包寗公路沿綫及大靑烏拉西山之間，均在苦戰中。此外錢江南岸，華軍雖已克復蕭山，殘日尚在負嵎；大洪山側，日軍困頓之餘，猶復增援竄犯。綜此動態，似乎今日之日本，雖於政治經濟外交諸端均陷窮途，而侵華軍事則仍具一逞之實力；雖然，此固日本餘力雄厚之證歟？抑為勢成弩末之證歟？</p>
<p>以言日本在經濟外交以及政治方面之失敗，實屬任何人均無從為之諱；即在日人本身，其不滿情緒亦復往往流露於無形。此决震撼日本政界之齋藤演說，其表面措辭，固似責難歷屆當局所奉為圭臬之近衛聲明過趨消極，不足補償日人之損失，而其言外之音，適以暴露一般日人之重大苦悶與對於軍政當局之失望。日當局縱即懲戒齋藤，刪改紀錄，亦無以掩人之耳目。由此而成為日本政治上之杌隍形勢，刻仍在繼續進展，終將如何推演，目前尚難逆睹；顧有得而體認者，即此種政治上之不安，實即其侵華軍事失敗之反映。且即就軍事本身言，日方縱至今仍能握有中國之若干點綫，問或能伺隙圖謀一逞，而在戰略運用上，則迄無顯著之成功。溯自戰事進人二期以來，日軍行動更趨於支離散漫，僅作瑣碎之投機，目標既極凌亂，行動亦見鈍滯，况史敗衂踵接，精銳盡失；即使偶獲進展，不但在軍略絕無價值可言，抑且對內對外亦不復有何刺激作用。最近日本政論家馬塲垣吾之言日「此後日軍雖或能攻至重慶，但爾時又當何如？」此誠一針見血之論，而與齋藤演詞同屬日本一般人民懷疑侵華戰爭，且不能信任其當局之表現。誠以居今日而言軍事，絕不能脫離政治經濟外交各方面之聯繫而獨立；後方之種種現象，咸足影響前方軍事之得失；現階段之日本軍力，其困頓程度或尚不如政治經濟外交之甚，但持與抗戰初期比較，則强窳銳鈍已相去遠甚，度其此後情勢，當然不免每况愈下。此非主觀武斷，揆之事理，在所必然，亦所必至也。</p>
<p>去年秋間日閥鑒於侵華戰事之久乏進展，曾有統一在華軍權之舉，於是西尾坂垣，相率來華；核彼半載以來之戰績，固何似乎？即如粵漢路南北兩端，去秋自湘北進窺，今春以粵北為目標，既未能同時於兩端採取攻勢，以為策應，此已顯示力量之既竭，而其結果，一敗於湘再敗於粵，尤見鋒銳之已盡。最近桂南之役，則無力先於西江覓取據點，以與邕防為椅角，以致侵桂隊伍，孤軍深入，僅以負固一嵎，往返衝突為能事。又如西北戰事，日方亦僅以輕騎出沒於大漠曠野間，而於黃河兩岸並無重大軍事動作相呼應。凡此種種，一方原於日方兵力之支絀，無以應付綿遠之戰場；他方亦可見日本軍事部署之支離，而所謂統一在華軍權以利調度支配者亦不過徒託空言，西南西北之戰，在形式上日方似志在切斷中國對外交通；事實上則桂南日軍縱竄擾有餘，實乏大舉深入之餘力，並其南寗附近各據點亦復難於確保。況西南對外孔道甚多，日方斷難加以封鎖。至於西北方面則自綏西以迄寗北，貧瘠荒寒大磧千里，無論在經濟上在軍事上皆乏重大價值；至於中蘇交通，由臨五以達庫倫之綫，向為中蘇所鮮予利用，則日軍之進犯綏西，亦不足以影響西北運輸路綫，彰彰明甚。說者謂：『日軍最近之攻勢，僅冀聳動國內外之視聽，且將隨國會閉幕而終了』。衡之戰局情形，殆頗近似；蓋此種缺乏周詳部署之動作，僅能以冒險求倖逞，無論在軍事上或政治上均無何等價值可言也。况華軍之戰略與實力日在突飛猛進中，日軍之行險僥倖即有所獲，亦復失之旋踵。以彼焦燥，侵此堅定，謂得有成就乎，潰敗而去，時間問題而己。</p>

<p>民政黨議員松本首先提出詢問云、日本政府既以調整對蘇關係為事、未知擬設法促使蘇聯中止援助中國國民政府吾、有田外相常即答稱、「日本民族對於蘇聯仍須戒備、不可稍存怠忽」、並謂、「反共產國際公約並非針對蘇聯而發、職是之故、日本謀與蘇聯調整關係、與反共產國際公的並不抵觸」、旋又答覆另一議員之詢問云、德國與蘇聯簽訂互不侵略協定之舉、在余所見、並非廢棄反共產國際公約之謂日本對於此項公約、仍常信守不渝、民政黨議員窪井旋就諾蒙亨劃界委員會工作陷於僵局一事、提出詢問、有用外相答稱、關於一般界務問題、或可組成小組委員會、從新加以討論、以期覔致解決辦法、畑陸相亦答稱、「少數蘇聯軍隊不斷侵犯該處界綫、致使劃界問題無法解決、抑劃界工作、原由雙方軍事當局負責辦理、嗣又移交外交代表主持、確曾獲有若干進展、」</p>

<p>重慶自去年十一月六中全會決議、定期於本年十一月十二日召開國民大會後、各方對此均極重視、政府對於大會之準備、亦正在積極進行、惟在此籌備期間、尚有許多問題、為各方所亟欲明瞭者、如國民大會之職權、及代表選舉問題、憲法草案問題、及各方研究憲政之方式問題等等、茲悉中央對此等問題、對於各省市黨部、及其他有關機關、已有具體之指示、特探誌其內容如左、</p>
<p>（甲）實施憲政之意</p>
<p>義（一）實施憲政為本黨之一貫主張、總理畢生努力、總裁歷年奮鬥、胥以實現憲政為主要方針、五十年來抱定民主立憲之主張、始終不渝者、惟有本黨、故本黨此次決定召集國民大會、實為實現本黨數十年來一貫之主張、我全黨同志、以及全國上下、均應以至忠至慎之心臨之、（一）憲政與訓政之關係、軍政。訓政。憲政。三時期之劃分、雖含有循序漸進之意、但政府為因應時代的要求、促進政治的進步、自可於訓政工作未完成以前、施行憲政、仍將訓政工作、於憲政開始後繼續完成、這是從總理遺歡、與總裁去年九月在國民參政會演說詞中、大家都能體會出來的、所以我們一方面要求實施憲政、一方面要求憲政實施後、繼續進行訓政未完成的工作、</p>
<p>（乙）國民大會之選舉與職權</p>
<p>選舉國民大會組織法、與國民代表選舉法、既經國民政府依立法手續鄭重頒布、並已由國民政府遵照實施、其依選舉法選出之代表、除附近逆有據、應由政府依法辦理外、自應一律有效、（二）職權此次國民大會之任務、依組織法第一條之規定、為制定憲法、並決定憲法施行日期、其性質純為一制憲機關、至執行憲法上所賦予之權限、則尚有待於將來、依照憲法規定所選出之國民大會組織法、所以不規定此次國民大會執行憲法所賦予之權限者、係因憲法由何項機關執行、自應由憲法規定、如以組織法規定制憲的國民大會行使憲法所賦予之權限、便無異以組織法決定憲法上所應決定之問題　以組織法限制憲機關之權力、預定憲法之內容、而提前賦予之、於制憲機關、於法理均有未合、</p>
<p>（丙）憲法草案問題</p>
<p>（一）法草案之合法性、國民政府明令宣布之憲法草案、係立法院集合全國公法學者、根據建國大綱及訓政時期之施政成績、竭兩年之努力起草而成、初稿完成後、又在六個月之內、公開徵求全國人民之批評、然後由本黨中央執行委員會詳加研討、盡量容納全國人民意見、定為草案、送國民政府立佈、故草案之頒布、實　完成一切手績、其合法性自無疑問、國民政府依據建國大綱必須提出該草案於國民大會、（二）國民大會之决定權、國民大會對於憲法草案當然有決定之權、本黨同志對於憲法草案之意見、可於一定期內向中央貢獻、由中央核定、彙提國民大會、國民參政會憲政期成會、對憲法草案之主張、經國民參政會通過後、將來自亦可送政府、轉提國民大會、以備採納、其他合法團體、對憲法草案之意見、將來自亦依國民大會代表之介紹、或其他法定方式、提來國民大會考慮、</p>
<p>（丁）憲政問題之討</p>
<p>論（一）集會、關於討論憲政問題之集會、如座談會。討論會。講演會等、在各省市由各有市黨部政府、同所在地參議會召集、以期博採民意、並即以之為憲政宣傳之助、（二）組織團體、在此戰爭未結束前政府對於為研究憲政而組織團體之舉、自亦不能不設定必要之限制、以免流弊、在重慶方面國民參政會之憲政期成會、為研究憲政向政府貢獻意見之合法機關、為集中意見起見、不必另有其他組織、其他各省市、如有組織之必要、亦須由各省市黨部政府、會同參議會組織憲政研究團體、領導各該地關於憲政問題之研究、（三）討論範圍、凡反對憲政及違反三民主義、而曲解憲政之言論、自應在取締之列、本黨黨員今後尤不可違背本黨既定政策、發表反對憲政之言論、（十一日電）</p>

<h3 id="c32">處置中國事件迄今一無成就 <a href="#c32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>

<p>前者近衛內閣未能解決中國事變即行吿退、平沼內閣如何、諸公當塲知之、阿部內閣雖曾宣言當以全力處置中國事變、結果則一事無成、即吿總辭職、現內閣旣已登臺、自可乘機與國人共同檢討此一問題、用敢就中國事變處置計畫之內　與範圍、向米內首相提出率直的詢問、此兩問題必須獲有答覆、</p>

<p>據余所見關於現行事變、中國，方面如何　置不問、日本方面確　若干　計錯誤之處、吾人最初原已決定不擴大事態、就地圖謀解決、但此項政策巳因中國方面之挑戰而打銷、自是厥後、日復一日月復一月、事變擴大一至於此、彼中國方面估計之錯誤、自不待言、余茲有一文件、爲諸公所値得考慮者、緣內閣情報局曾於去歲十二月十三日發表）種週報、內載一文、係中國派遺軍參謀部情報處處長所撰、內稱中日戰爭係由中國尤其是蔣介石上將對於日本認識未淸、聲日本不研究不認識中國所引起、換言之、即中國事變乃中日兩國彼此缺乏了解所　成、實則彼此兩國縱使作必要的反省、大規模事變仍屬無可避免、蓋兩國之間有一暗礁、遲早之間定必引起事件、蘆溝橋事件之終於發生、此乃中日兩國之定數、實無法加以避免也、</p>
<p>夫此次戰爭、何國可獲勝利、旣已毫無疑義、自須及早予以解決、蓋剷除中日兩民族間種種不幸、從而奠定和平基礎、匪特係日本政治家之責任、即在中國政治家亦屬責無旁貸、至於此種不幸如何剷除、將來安定如何確保、實乃當前之唯一問題、關於此層、中日兩國觀點如何、必須兼籌並顧而後可、惟是處置中國事變有一點未可漠視、即兩年半以來、日本人暨全民族已受極大之犧牲、人民所受犧牲如生命財產自由之損失、欲加以補償絕非易事、雖名之曰「事變」、實乃日本帝國所從未經歷之大規模戰爭、據畑陸相昨日在衆院報吿、日軍所佔領之土地大如日本帝國全部、此應歸功於日本士兵之英勇作戰、至目下爲止、日兵陣亡者約十萬人、官兵受傷者亦有數十萬員名之多、凡以處置中國事件爲言者、自不能不予以顧及也、</p>

<p>藉非然者、和平運動與樹立「新政權」計劃、定必歸於失敗、余言及此點、願就政府所擬中國事變解決計劃、詢問其範園與內容、以意度之、政府所作答復、必謂完全尊重中國主權、即對於中國他日內政外交均避不予以干涉、一切舉動倘有干涉之嫌、即係侵犯中國主權、此外、日本亦不擬攘奪中國領土、或要求賠款云云、吾國對於中國事變所費幾何、非余所知、特以衆院所核准之軍事經費而論、已達一百二十寓萬日圓之譜、總數或在二百萬萬日圓乃至三百萬萬日圓之問、或尙不止此數、亦未可知、吾國用去偌大軍費之後、在中國方面迄未能所獲一文、然則凡所費用、將爲吾全國人民之負祖、甚至後世子孫亦須永永担負下去矣、</p>
<p>又中國經濟他日當由吾國開發之說、雖甚囂塵上、但依照近衛聲明、則吾國不能要求壟斷中國之經濟、亦不能要求新中國限制第三國之權益、誠如是、余又不能無惑、蓋吾國政治家曾向人民大聲疾呼、謂「現行政策之目標、厥爲將歐美各國之勢力擯諸中國之外解放中國、勿任爲歐美各國所剝削而處於殖民地之地位、並使中國復爲中國人所有」、此種言論毫無根據、實與近衛聲明大相逕庭、未知目下何故仍以此爲言、</p>

<p>至以撤兵問題而論、依照汪精衛氏所稱、撤兵乃近衛聲明中最重要之上點、應迅速在各處前綫同時實行、祇有內蒙古一帶可於中日兩國簽訂反共產國際協定之後、准許日本駐紮軍隊、果爾則吾國軍隊退出估領區域後、未知所餘剩者尙有何物、此實余所大惑不解者也、試以汪精衛聲明與近衛聲明相比較、即可發覺其完全類似之點、質言之、彼二人者均以爲日本爲欲與中國「新政權」樹立和平起見、其第一步辦法、即應自中國撤退軍隊、僅有華北與內蒙古則在例外、亦即日軍在兩年半以來所爲前進鬭爭而飽嘗痛苦之土地均應予以退出、近衛聲明之意義、其果若是乎、日本政府其眞擬付諸實行歟、此即余所要求首相曁海陸軍省大臣必須予以說明者也、</p>

<p>第一節（一）槪述</p>
<p>地方狀况</p>
<p>年本埠狀况與前年大抵相同、蘇州河以南防區、仍　外國正規軍隊駐守、租界商團一面維持內部治安、一面仟爲外國駐軍之後備隊、虹口靶子塲之使用、仍受限制、所有値勤團昌前往或離開該處者、必須乘坐商團特備之運輸車、且夜間不得留宿在靶子塲、中華隊隊員則一槪不許前往、因此商團所有之常備營房、未能充分利用、團員之訓練、遂受阻碍、防區以內之狀况、最堪注意者、爲西區之趨於惡化、該區之治安、由捕房與「丁」區內之外國駐軍會同維持但商團方面、亦受影響、一因該團團員會在某某數時期內、奉命出動、一因該團所有鐵甲車業經移交捕房使用、鐵甲車係於上年七月廿五日移交、最近無交還之希望、查商團鐵甲車隊久經承認爲最精銳最幹練之部隊、此次將車輛移交以後、商團實力方面不免减色、且略鐵甲車使用頻繁、易於耗損（本年一月廿六日、當本報吿繕具以後、所有鐵甲車除兩輛外、其餘已由捕房交還商團矣）</p>
<p>各紀念日</p>
<p>前年每逢地方紀念日、租界內部，輒發生緊張狀態、上年亦然、但商團與捕房及外國駐軍能澈底合作、共同戒備、一切佈置、均奏良好效果、查地方紀念日之漸見增多、使商團方面發生一項嚴重問題、緣各團員、大半均有職業，不克於動員之時、立即分身應召、商團司令部爲解決上項困難起見、特另定辦法一項、即每逢有派遺團員實行巡邏之必要時、司令部僅召集所需要之人數命每一團員値勤數小時、然後任其返歸原處視事、此種辦法、使各級司令官之責任增重、在所難免、幸自實行以來、成績良佳、此皆有關係各級人員之功、至堪嘉許、蓋商團服務之效果、旣增至最高度、而各團員本人之事業、所受影響至少、</p>
<p>夏季訓練</p>
<p>往年夏季、自五月份起至十月一日止、商團照常受訓、鮮有休假日期、此因地方紀念日之增多、以及國際形勢之變化、使商團之實力不得不力求精銳、上年之訓練科目、比通常爲多、各團員踴躍受訓、堪稱滿意、若干團員爭先參加、而因額滿見遺者、不在少數、本埠外國駐軍常派員至商團祖仟訓練、商團方面、對於駐滬英軍司令曁美國海軍第四聯隊司令、深表感忱、又商團於舉行訓練使用街道之時、工部局警務處長、常飭屬妥爲佈置、亦應一併致謝、</p>
<p>（二）前年十二月一日至上年九月三十日又上年雙十節之服務經過</p>

<p>總述</p>
<p>查每年訓練年度、自十月一日開始、按照往年通例、訓練課程、大半集中於上半年敎授、俾受訓之各級官員及團佐等能溫習舊課、並將所獲知識、轉授所屬團員、至於課程之內容、往年通常爲武器訓練、沙板技術演講、操法及行政訓練等等、但上年因工部局曾限令各團員、在驅散暴動份子及巷戰術方面、應受澈底訓練、故訓練科目內容、業經遵照改訂、武器訓練、除刺刀戰鬪法外、一律暫停、但須由各隊自行溫習、爲各隊高級指導昌開辦之特別武器訓練班、曾於六七兩月間舉行、經證明有重大價値、商團司令部又曾爲各隊指導員開辦幹部訓練班兩班、受訓各員同意於訓練期間內決不缺席、上課時間、爲星期六下午一時四十五分至八時、又星期日上午六時四十五分，至下午七時、其間進餐或休息之時間頗短、每班結束時、會舉行考試一次、成績甚佳、司令部又規定每隊應分別舉辦幹部訓練班一班、任何團員、均須參加、　（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c89">公庫法規芻論 <a href="#c89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>— 夏高波</p>
<p>學者嘗謂我國財務行政之組織與設施頗有獨特之處：即四權分立之聯立綜合組織也。聯立綜合組織，簡稱聯綜組織，除極少數之學者（如胡善恒先生）提示訾議外，莫不引爲我國財務行政之佳構。蓋其精義在權責之超然，冀獲分工合作之效。此種組織係基於總理五權憲法之機構，故非其他三權分立及內閣制之國家所能效襲也。聯綜組織之成效基於四大系統之確立與健全。四大系統者，指行政系統（即命令系統），出納系統（即公庫系統）主計系統（爲積極的審計）及審計系統（爲消極的審計）是也。過去，自法令以觀，則各種會計機關組織法（專指行政主計出納及審計四端）均已頒布，明令施行；各種辦事程序之法（如預算法，會計法，審計法及決算法等），亦已先後公布施行，惟公庫法（民國二十七年六月九日公布）及其施行細則（二十八年六月二十七日行政院公布）雖經先後公布，惟因政治條件尙未充分健全，故遭未施行。近則鑒以抗戰建國之時，國家收支之統一急小待緩，俾公帑得涓滴歸公，加强國家財力，淸明之政治亦得以實現，故國府於民國二十八年六月二十四日明令公庫法自十月一日起分期分區逐漸施行，則舉世稱羨之聯綜組織下四大系統於是而均告確立，勵精圖治亦斯時矣。故公庫法之施行，在我國財政史上具有重大之意義，不可以等閒視之也。</p>
<p>筆者嘗草「即將施行之公庫法」（見第二十三卷第二十九期銀行週報）一文，於公庫法未施行前作扼要之介紹，附抒一得之見並寄無限希望於未來。今再就條文加以研究，以爲芻論，然恐芻蕘之不若也。</p>
<p>一，公庫存款契約之規定　考我國之公庫制度係採用「銀行存款制」，故公庫法（以下簡稱「本法」）第八條有云：「銀行代理所收納之現金及到期票據證券，均用存款方式……」則公款之存入，該代理銀行或郵政機關自有運用之權及支付利息之義務也。至兩者（公庫主管機關與代理銀行）間之權義關係，依法應以契約定之，並經該公庫主管機關之上級機關（按國庫主管機關之上級機關爲行政院；省庫及直隸行政院之市庫主管機關之上級機關爲財政部；縣市庫主管機關之上級機關爲該省財政廳）之核准。（見本法第八條，第二條第二項，施行細則第十七條）</p>
<p>至契約之內容或必要事項本法及其施行細則並無週密之規定，略謂「除受法令特定之限制外，以契約定之。……」鄙意此項規定實嫌攏統，殊欠週密。誠然，兩者間之權義關係確因各種情形之不同而異，如經法文明定，反見扞格不入之弊。然若干基本之關係與事項，似亦可作概括之規定，俾代理銀行與該公庫主管機關簽訂契約時有所適從，其必要事項亦不致遺漏。否則一經簽定，由上級機關核准後，如生不便而欲修訂時必感麻煩矣。爲時間迅速，爲舉辦順利計，公庫法施行細則對此似應有適當之規定也。</p>
<p>二，撥款通知單之商榷　依施行細則之規定，代理公庫之銀行或郵政機關，收到公庫主管機關所送來之支付書命令聯後，應照數由收入總存款撥入請領機關普通經費存款帳戶，並塡發「撥款通知單」，送達請領機關。而領款機關則於收到公庫主管機關所送來之支書通知聯後，然後塡具領款收據，即向代理公庫之銀行或郵政機關具領（本法施行細則第二十三，二十四條，又第二十六條第二項）。而領款機關是否必待收到代理銀行之撥款通知單後，始可塡具領款收據前項具領，抑該項撥款通知單之收到與否並無關係，法無明文規定。</p>
<p>吾人憑事實而論，代理銀行與領款機關大多同在一地，代理銀行於收到公庫主管機關送來之支付書命令聯後作成轉帳記錄，然後塡成撥款通知單飭送領款機關，則領款機關收到公庫主管機關所送來之支付書通知聯當在收到撥款通知單之前（因後者又經代理銀行之手），故領軟機關如僅憑支付書通知聯即可前往具領，則撥軟通知單必等於虛設，而毫無效用可言矣。又自銀行而言、旣法文規定須出具撥款通知單，可知若在未出具之前，或已出具而尙未送達之前必不允付款，蓋銀行方面以爲撥款通知單實爲良好付款憑證之一也。此中手續上之問題，如無確切之規定，每將發生無謂之糾紛。</p>
<p>故鄙意公庫法施行細則中似應有明白之規定，例如：領款機關必待收到代理銀行送來之撥款通知單，然後連同支付書通知聯及塡就之領款收據前往具領，惟領款機關收到支付書通知聯而未收到撥款通知單時，得憑通知聯向代理銀行查詢而已。</p>
<p>三，銀行代理資格之槪括規定、我國之公庫制度係銀行存款制，故公庫之代理機關係屬銀行或郵政機關。關於銀行之選擇，法規上僅示四項原則：（一）國庫以中央銀行爲原則，（二）國庫以外之各級公庫事務，無中央銀行之處得指定各該省市縣之地方銀行代理，（三）無地方銀行者，得指定其他銀行代理，但須先經上級政府公庫主管機關（參閱本文第一點按語）核准，（四）未設銀行之地方，應指定郵政機關代理。</p>
<p>至所謂「其他銀行」之選定，法文未加規定，似無標凖可據，如銀行之性質，華商銀行與洋商銀行，銀行資本之大小，郵政機關之確定等，頗成問題。雖然，其「指定」須經該公庫主管機關之上級機關核准，法文雖無明定，當亦不致任意接洽成立，然因無標凖可以依據，則不無阻碍，我國官廳公文往來，例多稽延日久，週折殊多，將不免病於延滯，失諸敏捷也。故槪括之規定，實為施行細則所必備。例如其他銀行應以（一）商業銀行爲原則，儲蓄銀行次之，農業銀行又次之（以資金週轉靈活爲先後），（二）除特殊情形外，不得指定洋商銀行，（三）有半官式（Quasi-public-PrivateBank）銀行者，應儘先指定半官式銀行（可靠）（四）以資本雄厚，經營穩健爲優先之要件（可根據各銀行近年來之決算表而加以分析即得），（五）郵政機關指郵政儲金匯業局，無儲金匯業局者得指定郵政局。</p>
<p>四，財物信託之規定　按公庫代理機關之職務有二：（一）公庫現金票據證券之出納，保管及移轉，（二）財產契據之保管。財產之契據指所有權之單據及棧單，提單或其他證明文件，此則法有明文規定也（本法第二條，施行細則第二條）。</p>
<p>惟事實上財物不僅保管，且得運用（生產或生息），以發揮物之經濟效用，而增公帑之收益，此爲理財當然之法則也。</p>
<p>夫確立公庫制度之目的，簡言之有二：一則希冀收支統一，以收經濟敏捷之效，二則避免自行收支，以防裁留侵占之弊。則財物運用於收益者自不得由各該機關行政長官自理，此非效小人之度君子，實公庫制度之基本原則也。今財物之保管借諸銀行，則其運用當亦同屬。然委託運用並非「存款關係」而屬「信託關係」，故公庫主管機關與代理銀行原訂之契約不應附帶包括在內，應另訂信託契約者甚明，然法規未有明定，亦無條文可以準用。</p>
<p>鄙意本法施行細則中對此似有規定之必要，其要點如受託人之資格（是否必須或不得由代理銀行担任，）訂定之手續及其核定等是。</p>
<p>五，會計年度及分月之規定　公庫法規中，屢曾提及「年度」，「日報」，「旬報」及「月報」等字樣，惟其起訖日期並無明文規定。依法律上類推之例，此點似不成問題，蓋會計年度得依預算法（修正預算法第十一條）上規定，「日」報「旬」報則可根據會計法（會計法第二十一條）之規定，當無異議。然自法律之周詳，一貫與肯定三要件而論，在公庫法規中仍有規定之必要。例如會計年度預算法中已有規定，而會計法第二十一條第一項尙有「會計年度之開始及終了依預算法之所定」等語，即屬此故。是以鄙意公庫法施行細則中應有類似上列之規：「會計年度依預算法之所定。日，旬，月之確定依會計法之所定。「亦所以示法律之周詳，一貫與肯定也。</p>
<p>嘗憶八九年前，有一熱耳之口號，「打倒貪官汚吏！」揆諸實際，貪也汚也，莫不指財務上之作弊。明淸以來，入仕而仍兩袖淸風者甚尠覯也，何以故？蓋財務行政紊亂異常，行政長官類多兼掌財政，侵呑截留，易如反掌。國民政府成立後，立圖淸治，嚴懲汚吏，然多偏於消極，作事後之懲戒耳。近年來竭力改進計政，不無成效，今更確立公庫制度，明令施行公庫法，實爲貪汚官吏之又一棒喝，爲吾民衆所樂聞之事也。故筆者嘗不避譾陋，於施行前爲文介紹，以迎此財政史上之偉舉，今則史抒一得之見以貢當局與同好，作拋磚引玉之企望也。　二十八年十二月於復旦大學</p>
<h3 id="c90">美日商約廢止與上海黑市 <a href="#c90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>— 曹林曄</p>
<p>日本是先天不足的國家，一切工業上必需品完全依靠着別國的供給。戰時的需要，隨着消耗增加而增加。至於詳細的數字統計，却不得而知，因爲自一九三匕年七月後即停止發表。就平時而言，日本每年所需要的重工業原料大概如下。</p>
<p>鋼材　四·四四一（千噸）　不詳</p>
<p>生鐵　四·一九五　30％</p>
<p>鐵礦　一三·二四八　90％　得自我國印度美國等</p>
<p>廢鐵　一·四九七　50％　完全為美國供給</p>
<p>石炭　四·四二　　不詳　自亟生產者亦有我國供給者</p>
<p>石油　八五·五二三　90％　得自英美美佔　％</p>
<p>日本原料主要的來源現在事實上祇有美國。但是因爲日本在華侵略，犧牲了美國在華的利益，而且美國的人民絕對同情中國的抗戰。因此日美商約便撒廢了。</p>
<p>美日商約廢止後，日本需要美國的原料的辦法，祇有在上海奪取。並非上海是此種原料的產地，乃在上海可以向美購買。自然日本人會利用奸商來代爲採購。然日幣將一瀉千丈。外匯因之大變。但法幣的兌匯率，却仍舊保住不變。因爲法幣不過在其中做媒介作用而已。邇來日僞幣對法幣的跌値，便是這個理由。</p>

<p>易子慶君來問，由王海波先生答復如次：</p>
<p>問：申報商業新聞（上月十二日）欄內有「天津電申滙三元爲一百〇七元」是否即在津交津地法幣一百〇七元在上海收回一百元之意？</p>
<p>答：即津交法幣一百〇七元，滬收法幣一百元</p>
<p>問：又「聯鈔」暗盤昂半元爲九十六元」是否爲在津法幣一百元可購聯鈔九十六元？</p>
<p>答：即在津以法幣百元，可買「聯鈔」九十六元，惟此係非法行爲。</p>
<p>問：上題所謂「暗盤」者其命意何在？「聯鈔」每元値先令若干？以「聯鈔」在津購外匯有限制否？</p>
<p>答：「暗盤」在此作非法解釋。「聯鈔」不能購買外滙。必須先調爲法幣，然後始能購買。</p>
<p>李文裕君來問：「帶有華北地名（如平·津·山東等）之法幣是否通用於內地？」</p>
<p>答·據記者所知，係內地銀行收兌，而非內地可以通用。</p>

<h3 id="c95">吃元寳 <a href="#c95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>— 陳亮</p>
<p>元寳是古時的一種制幣，有金元寳，有銀元寳，可用以交換貨品，誰元寳該的多，誰就是財主，輾轉傳變，降至今日，元寳早已絕跡，代替着的，已是花花綠綠的法幣，就是眞正百萬富翁之家，亦未必在他的銀箱裏能找出隻把元寳來吧。其他人家，也就可想而知。或者戲台上跳加官時還能見到木質的一隻。</p>
<p>元寳雖已絕跡，人們心目中，却仍以元寳爲可貴可愛，化子乞兒深悟是種心理，向入求乞必致其善頌善禱之詞曰：『大老闆，恭喜你一年四季賺元寳。』大老闆或者看在元寳面上，不吝濟助他二分電車票。到這幾天，元寳之聲，更洋洋盈耳，不但空口說，而且實有其物，更而且可吃。吃元寳，倒是奇跡，豈不成爲『呑金』了嗎！</p>
<p>一說明，就無足爲奇，原來這正是歷來革而不除的風俗與積習，在年宴席上，幾無一樣肴饌不是元寳的替身，蹄膀，元寳也，猪脚爪，亦元寳也，醬油蛋，元寳也，肉饀蛋餃，亦元寳也。他如蛤蜊，鯉魚，茶至鹹烤長生果，亦無一不是元寳，主人舉筷相邀曰：『來來，我們來吃元寳。』客人却之不恭，受之有愧，隨機發個利市：『恭喜府上元寳源源而來。』主人自然歡喜：『托福托福，大家發財，大家賺元寳。』於是觥籌交錯，賓主盡歡而散。</p>

<p>— 昭實</p>
<p>報章對於社會人羣最捷之成功爲服務，Service廣吿之最上乘，亦曰服務。近如英國某帽廠售價特昂之呢帽，恒於裏層揷入一紙，明誌善於用帽者保退回換四信條。</p>
<p>「一勿著過多之塵埃，每日宜細刷。</p>
<p>二凡不潔凈之帽，勿任過濕。</p>
<p>三勿任汚穢之手觸此帽。</p>
<p>四帽如不加諸首，立即妥爲存放。</p>
<p>所謂善於用帽者，謂保顏色形狀之無改變，意則不變色不改樣也。</p>
<p>若用帽者履行上述四條件而仍見有不合之處，保退回換。」</p>
<p>購者因見英某廠之帽，特誌保用久遠之方法，每爲一種求知慾所驅使，而對某廠出品，信之獨深，某廠之貨，遂不脛而走四海，此心理之作用也</p>
<p>吾華物力艱難，無論衣食住行，莫不應有深切之研究，各商家苟知師法先進國廣吿學者之服務精神，詳示用法，起爲同胞謀便利，同時又可增進國貨信譽，生面別開，誠屬一舉兩得也。</p>
<h3 id="c97">路頭酒 <a href="#c97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>— 張孟昭</p>
<p>一年容易，今天（十二日）又是廢曆新年的一五路日」（也可以說是財神日）了。習俗舊式工商機關裏家家必於是日晚上大吃其「路頭酒」，說是吃了之後，一年四季，大家必定發財。中國人着重「吃」，同時也着重「錢」的，大家都不免脫口而出的說說「人生所爲何來？」</p>
<p>「五路日」在吾錫商家的習俗，又稱「舖蓋生日」夥友們的去留，都在隔夕（年初四）決定，經理們審議那一位夥友是勤勞，誠實，努力工作的；那一位是吃糧不管事的，荒唐的，勤勞的留職，荒唐的開除。夥友們事前的對於自己職位的去留問題，都諱莫如深，朦在鼓裏，必須等候到「吃路頭酒時」沒有自己的份兒，那才瞿然失驚，知道自己要捲鋪蓋滾蛋了。所以路頭酒席上，有我一席的朋友，就堆滿笑容，喜之不勝：沒有的仁兄，不免雙眉緊鎖，悲從中來了。其實拆穿了西洋鏡，經理們果能眞眞以往年的勤惰標準別去留嗎？那也未必盡然，因爲有裙帶關係的人，常是盤踞要津，安如泰山，平時儘管荒唐，吃路頭酒來，總是南面而坐。因此被革職的朋友，心中的惱怒不平，眞是「有苦無訴處，啞子吃黃連」。照此看來「路頭酒」雖美，眞有些可吃而不可吃呢。</p>

<p>春節菜餚中，有一樣東西佔着很重要的地位，要算是綫粉了。在平時所買的綫粉，總是浸在水中的，而到了農曆年終，就有綫粉乾出現於市上，大概大家小戶，沒有一家不備綫粉乾的吧；因爲年餚中少不了一個火鍋，而火鍋中可就少不了綫粉。說起綫粉的代價，在戰前不過二角錢一斤，而現在却已漲到一元有零，眞是漲得嚇人，只爲火鍋中少不了它，所以大家也不得不忍痛吃一吃了。綫粉的本身，毫無滋味，全靠鮮湯來帮它的忙，除了下在火鍋裏之外，和別的葷菜似乎不大合得來，在素菜中，那麼可和雪菜菠菜或靑菜同炒，或者在熟油中汆黃之後，與麵筋豆腐乾一同紅燒，此外就沒有新花樣了。綫粉乾以白色者爲上，黃色的一經煮過，就爛糟糟的，不大適口。</p>

<h3 id="c99">適應歐戰環境之衣食住行 <a href="#c99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>— 天視自荷京寄</p>
<p>一九三九年九月爲始之第二歐戰，雖不至如二十五年前範圍之擴大，而歐洲人之衣食住行四者，因受影響，甚多改變，特舉數事，以例其餘。</p>
<p>一曰衣。西方社會最易逐時改變之物爲女衣。其特便於戰時之女衣，導源於倫敦巴黎，而風行於各大城市者，大抵採用深綠色，或採深暗一類之葡萄紅，或爲色調不同之棕色，而衣幅之上，恒織淺色之花紋，或加淺色之裝飾。裙則因省料而須變短。大衣裁製價特昂，最不便逐時改變，其戰時之有異於平時，祇爲加一淺色之帶於其上。手套宜與大衣之色相配合，大抵採用深暗之色，而加淺色之鑲嵌。雨衣則宜改購色之略淺者。以上各物之憑淺色爲點綴，盡爲避免空襲警報下暗地奔竄中之彼此相衝撞。鞋子須採棕紅之暖色或深綠色，橡皮套鞋及長桶靴，尤不可不早先購備，深恐警報來時燈忽熄，道上積水不能見。同時婦人所携手包宜加大，俾可兼貯應急之手電燈，以及龐大不雅觀之防毒面具。男子則衣履一切，悉仍舊貫，惟在每日出門之先必佩帶淺色一類之金屬襟章會徽校微或帽微，以防警報下之黑地相衝撞。又婦女界結綫一事，能使困悶之人，隨時隨地，均得借工作而忘却恐慌及憂慮，如在交通隔阻中之火車停滯於半途，以及燈火管制下之　居斗室，閑佇者苟藉結綫以自遣，同時所結成之寒衣，又便於撫恤救濟難胞或寄送前綫將士，誠屬一舉兩得。</p>
<p>二曰食。　消化足以左右體質之健康，戰時爲人，首宜保健。居後方者食肉過多害消化，肉類是生酸食物，非若蔬菜之爲生鹼alkalizing食物，食肉者用力不能久而易感疲倦，甚且患腎炎，或致高血壓，不可不及早提防。常人患胃病而不能進食，半爲神經作用，醫專家就上屆歐戰爲借鑒，每見軍人至前綫，因無暇想及胃病，而所苦恒霍然愈，其逗遛於後方之人，則仍可以感不消化之苦，欲免此苦，首宜擇食。一曰，食小甚油之物。如食脂肪一類—物品時，僅進牛油或植物油所製肴饌。二曰，勿多食麵包。三曰，勿嗜烘焙bake之肉食。四曰，勿進椒芥等刺激品。五曰，飲酒不宜太醉。六曰，進食宜緩。</p>
<p>三曰住。　戰時體質之健康，固甚重要，而精神之調攝，尤爲當務之急。住之第一要件爲睡。睡之能足，則精神倍增，而工作之能率必倍大，東方社會之牌叙，最有大害於身心。而據西方專門家言，用力之勞役，睡至六七小時或已滿足，至若用心者之後方治文事，其每夜之睡眠，應以八九小時爲最少限度。若取上屆歐戰之經騐爲言，則前敵之兵，反較後方被轟炸區域之人民爲易入睡，假令前敵將士，經大拼殺之後而不得美睡，則在數日以後，精兵即變爲敗軍，是以第一次歐戰之最新方法，首求分配之適宜，務令前方出力之人，得按時之交替與休息，而後方之人民，更當知陲之不可或缺。住之又一要件，爲男女居室之能患難相安。戰時百業緊張，難免因家居之不如意而引起口角衝突，西人稱易發怒爲有「火氣hot　temper」，自今科學眼光爲判斷，不妨即以精神治療之法節制之。其法宜使易發怒之男女兩人，勤寫日記，而將每次引起怫怒之言語或動作，詳寫牢記。蓋治火氣之技術，在能自知怒之如何而發與何時將發，從此控制，自屬事半而功倍也。反之男女居室，如能隨時提及對方所愛之人與所最喜回憶之事，亦是平伏火氣，因以渡過逆境而臻順境之妙法。</p>
<p>四曰行。　無論交戰國或中立國，盡知節省煤油，而避用摩托化之交通工具，休假出遊之汽車，尤干例禁，而悉以脚踏車代之，一時脚踏車之營業，利市十倍。荷國女主慈護陛下H．M．Koningin　Wilhelmina貴爲元首，亦親駕脚踏車出門，事與我華要人之舍汽車而乘人力車，遙遙相對。</p>

<p>— 葉雨凡</p>
<p>我的同住L君，他這幾天眞是苦透了，晚上一回來，站在二層樓的樓頭喊着他的幼弟：</p>
<p>「雷昇！上來！走上來吧！時候不早了。」</p>
<p>回答是：「還有兩個莊。」依舊是劈拍拍，一片淸脆的竹牌聲。</p>
<p>這一套「寒假作業」，日夜如此。我住的是三樓，L君一家住的是二樓，底下是所謂「上海的二房東」也。二房東的室內，簡直麻風（麻將風氣）甚熾，幾個兒女，也都打得一手好牌，這眞配稱「敎子有方」（方城）。</p>
<p>那位L君的幼弟，也是初中學生，寒假期中，差不多天天混入麻將撰克Twenty　one裏，有時撇撇蘭花，三朋四友，弄點小吃吃，高興起來，還要跑跑回力球塲。</p>
<p>這實在是一個値得注意的現實題材。學校不能沒有假期，而有假期的靑年學子竟如此玩日愒歲，究屬問心。况且在假期中濡染賭風，養成胡調，斷送靑年於此的洪爐中，初非學校給假的本意。因此不能不喚起家長的注意，否則前途實堪焦慮，同住L君的幼弟，特其現實的一角標本焉耳！</p>

<p>— 季甫芳</p>
<p>張先生向朋友借了十塊錢，回家對張師母說：「何先生替我薦了這個事情，還沒有謝他，現在年底，我總該送一些禮物。」張師母也很贊成。於是買了幾斤年糕，一只火腿，送到何家去。</p>
<p>送禮去的時候，恰巧李老太在何家吃飯，她看見張師母送禮，回家後便和兒子商量道：「張家跟何家的交情，和我們差不多，他們送禮，我們也是免不了的。」她兒子素來順從母親的話，便拿出來十塊錢，讓她去辦年禮。</p>
<p>禮送到何家，何太太又覺得不過意了，她吿訴丈夫：「李老太的這份禮是不能白受的。」所以第二天，何家又送禮給李家。</p>
<p>李老太看見禮物中，多半是糖菓，這是她和兒子都不很愛好的，便隨意取了兩件，送給對門徐家，落得做個人情。</p>
<p>可是徐家也不能白受她的，也在設法送禮了。</p>
<p>在生活困難的呼聲中，送禮並不是人們甘心願意的，祇是中了「人情」，「心願」的毒。</p>

<p>「如此上海」徴文</p>
<p>上海誠然有一部份人挨受着工作的慘酷的壓迫，整日地毫無休息，然而大部份，幾乎是為了消遣而忙碌，為了消遣而奔走。</p>
<p>馬路上儘多着閒散的人，踱他們的方步，茶館中，浴室裏，儘多着無聊的人，悠然討論他們的廢話。</p>
<p>戲院無論演什麽戲，皆掛起客滿的牌子，響導社如雨後春筍的勃興，妓女們時而東，時而西的跋涉着；全是爲了解救上海人「消遣」的飢渴。</p>
<p>除了那些依賭為生者外，皆目財博為「消遣品」。雖然每天在賭博的，但是死也不肯承認這是他的日常例行工作，不過「消遣消遣」而巳。爲了「消遺」，賭塲的戶限幾爲之穿，旅館中幾乎每一房間在作方城之戰，擘拍聲可與槍砲聲並駕齊驅，而張九官張三槐等「古人」也會被人背得爛熟了。</p>
<p>其他還有不勝枚舉的許許多多的遺消爲了消遣，誰也儼然是一位忙人了。於是上海繁盛了，路上車如流水馬如龍，還充塞着一羣擁擠着的行人。新興事業勃發了，冷僻的事也被顧及了，別的且不說，而虛渺的夢竟也會被注意和珍視的呢。</p>
<p>時間是繼續不斷的降臨着，永遠沒有盡期的。而上海人也祇管想把目前的時間消磨過去，以迎接未來的待間。</p>

<p>第二十回　世界交通文共語　兒童敎育獎學憐才</p>
<p>江鏡蓉八歲就喪了父親，正是一個孤兒，而且家况蕭條，父親故世後，並沒有一些家產。幸虧他母親十分賢惠，那時候，中國的舊道德，以改嫁爲不貞、江鏡蓉的母親，年紀雖不過二十九歲，但她想：我有一子二女，拖了一班兒女們，再嫁一個丈夫，一定要吃他們的虧。况且嫁了丈夫以後，安知不再生育，前夫的兒女，與後夫的兒女，將要又分出軒輊來。因此她情願守志撫孤，靠着她十指做些女工，居然也使江鏡蓉在小學裏畢了業。越是那班孤苦的兒童，越是勤學。加着江鏡蓉的資質聰明，學校中的成績，輒在別一位學生之上。但是到了小學畢業以後，江鏡蓉的母親，再無力使他兒子升學進入中學了。不比現代的中國，小學是完全免費，國家負了敎育國民的義務的。中學也收極少的學費，使國民輕於擔負。江鏡蓉那時十三歲了，他說：自己無力升學，也就不想升學了。他很愛他的妹妹，他的兩位妹妹，一位是九歲，一位也是七歲了，却還沒有進過小學。他寗願自己不進中學，將兩位妹妹去進小學，即使兩位妹妹不能全進小學，先將大的妹妹送進小學，小的妹妹暫緩一緩。因爲大的味味，今年九歲，再不能蹉跎了。好得江鏡蓉自己在高小裏讀書時候，每天回來，晚上必定來敎他的兩位妹妹，有如小先生一般。現在大的妹妹進了小學，小的妹妹仍舊可以自己敎敎，或者到下學期，有力可以使小妹妹也進小學校最好。因爲大的妹妹，在家裏，由她哥哥小先生敎過了，所以一進小學校，便跳升到三年級，尤其是使江鏡蓉格外高興。原來他的小學畢業，不再升入中學的緣故，一則，因爲中學的學費很貴，母親有些擔負不起；二則，他想自己雖然是個兒童，也想帮助帮助他的母親，很想找到一種工作。可憐那時中國的兒童，工作的機會很少。到那種商店與工塲中去當一個學徒，簡直是像做奴僕小厮一般，他母親又不肯送他進去。他後來自己謀得了賣報童子一個職業，無論嚴寒盛暑，他終是每日奔波，總是送報給人家看，爲了他的勤懇，生涯倒還不惡。　（二三六）</p>

<p>現在各小學已經開學，都將上課，而本年廢曆新年，正在上課時間之內。因爲各家庭的鬧着新年，快樂慶祝，各小學生勢必逃學。在家遊玩，而學校中竟變成「學生放先生」的局面。</p>
<p>這一事實自然最好是家長方面督促子女去上學，學校方面呢，亦應側面去勸吿或獎勵學生上課，現在筆者有一辦法，供獻給各小學校長作參考。便是作若干小旗，上面寫「勤學」字，每日作一統計，將該旗贈獎給在新年中出席人數最多的一級，以示獎勵。因爲這區區小旗，在天眞的小學生們是以爲非常的榮耀和尊貴，一旦得了「勤學旗」，他們眞是說不出的愉快，互相鼓勵，還希望明日又能獲得；而沒有得到者，定努力提倡，使同學不無故曠課，奪取獎旗。</p>

<h3 id="e1">A Great Victory for Chinese Troops Near Shanglin; Japanese Offensive in Southern Guangxi Stalled; Japanese Troops Invading Wuming Encircled by Chinese Forces and Defeated, Retreating to Shuangqiao; Chinese Troops Annihilate Over 16,000 Japanese in Continuous Fighting <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing - According to news received here today from the Chinese side, on Friday, after the Chinese army launched a fierce counter-offensive near Shanglin, the Japanese offensive in southern Guangxi collapsed. Japanese troops began retreating southwest that same afternoon. Recent military dispatches indicate that the key town of Shanglin is now in the hands of the Chinese army. This area has been the site of numerous decisive battles in the past few years. Shanglin is a small city on the south bank of the Qianjiang River (transliterated), serving as the gateway to northern Guangxi. It is generally believed that crossing the river north of Binyang to directly reach Liuzhou would be exceedingly difficult, as the river's eastward flow passes through treacherous gorges. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<p>Liuzhou - Japanese troops attempting to invade Wuming were encircled and fiercely attacked by Chinese forces. Fighting to the morning of the 10th resulted in Japanese corpses covering the field, with over half of their forces killed or wounded. They retreated to Shuangqiao, pursued by the Chinese army. Remaining Japanese forces near Shanglin were swept away by the Chinese, with many captured or killed. Currently, there is no trace of the Japanese in the vicinity. (11th)</p>
<p>Liuzhou - Continuous rain on the southern Guangxi front has hampered Japanese activity. Japanese troops attempting to harass the area near Shanglin were fiercely attacked by the large Chinese army, resulting in a disorganized retreat. (10th)</p>
<p>Guilin - The headquarters announced that Japanese troops in Litang were fiercely attacked by a certain unit of the Chinese army, resulting in over 1,500 Japanese casualties. They retreated to Binyang. (10th)</p>
<p>Guilin - Since the 9th, the major battle in southern Guangxi has unfolded as anticipated by the Chinese. Chinese troops in the Shanglin area launched a sudden and fierce attack on the morning of the 9th, making rapid progress. By noon on the 10th, they had annihilated over 2,000 Japanese troops in the area south of Shanglin. The Chinese army continued to pursue with great courage, encircling and attacking in multiple directions, eliminating another 2,400 Japanese troops and capturing countless personnel, equipment, and ammunition. By noon today, this group of stubborn Japanese had been completely wiped out. At present, between Shanglin and Binyang, only Japanese corpses are visible, the vegetation stained red. Not a single Japanese soldier survived. On the Yongwu Road, the Chinese army, having lured the Japanese into areas of absolute Chinese advantage on the 8th and 9th, immediately began encirclement and annihilation operations in the area south of Wuming on the evening of the 9th, cutting off the Japanese forces section by section. In the fierce battle until noon yesterday, over half of the Japanese forces were annihilated, estimated at about 5,000 men. The remaining Japanese troops repeatedly attempted to break through, retreating towards Silong (northwest of Binyang), but were firmly intercepted by the Chinese army and ultimately failed to escape. On the evening of the 10th, they were driven to the vicinity of Shuangqiao (south of Wuming) and subjected to a devastating attack. Currently, there are no surviving Japanese soldiers between Shuangqiao and Wuming. In the Binyang area, since the Chinese army broke through the invading Japanese troops at the Litang Bridge (southeast of Binyang) and Liangping, they continued to advance towards Binyang, reaching the west of the city. In the past two days, remnants of the Japanese troops inside Binyang City and in the northwest area have repeatedly attempted to escape, but were repelled. The fate of this group of Japanese troops is also entirely in the hands of the Chinese army. It is estimated that the Chinese army, having launched a successful major battle, has annihilated over 16,000 Japanese troops in the past few days. The brave soldiers on the Chinese front do not appear complacent, considering it only one-tenth or one-twentieth of the intended goal. (10th)</p>

<p>Eastern Zhejiang Front - Recent activity of Japanese warships off the Zhejiang coast suggests an attempted troop landing. At around 8 PM on the 9th, three Japanese warships and ten motorboats, carrying over 200 Japanese soldiers, arrived off the coast of Xiepu, northwest of Zhenhai, and forcibly attempted to land. The Chinese garrison calmly responded, waiting until the Japanese approached the shore before unleashing a fierce barrage of artillery fire, causing the Japanese to suffer heavy casualties and retreat back to their ships. At around 11 PM that night, the Japanese attempted a second landing, but were again bravely repulsed by the Chinese garrison. After these two unsuccessful attempts, the Japanese warships and boats remained in the area for some time, only heading towards the Li Yang coast after midnight. Also, at 9 PM on the 9th, a Japanese warship off the coast of Ruian launched six motorboats to pursue a Chinese merchant ship, but no damage was inflicted. (10th)</p>
<p>Eastern Zhejiang Front - There has been a slight increase in Japanese troops in Xiaoshan. On the morning of the 10th, a portion of the Japanese army advanced towards Xinlinzhou, east of Xiaoshan, but was repulsed. The Chinese captured many supplies in this engagement. On the evening of the 7th, Chinese troops infiltrated the Japanese警戒line at the Qianjiang Bridge under cover of darkness, using swift and agile movements to destroy portions of the bridge that the Japanese had repaired, and kill the Japanese sentries. It is also reported that Chinese forces in western Zhejiang are very active behind Japanese lines. On the 5th, they completely destroyed the telegraph lines erected by the Japanese along the route from Lingjiaqiao in Fuyang to the Fuchun River. (10th)</p>
<p>Yinxian - At 1 AM on the morning of the 9th, three Japanese warships suddenly appeared off the coast of Longshan in Xiepu, Zhenhai, launching eight motorboats which approached the coast and began firing machine guns wildly, attempting to land. They were met with fierce resistance from the Chinese garrison, which destroyed and sank one Japanese boat. By 9 PM, they were unable to withstand the pressure and retreated, only to attempt a second attack. The Chinese army again inflicted heavy casualties, and by 10 AM on the 10th, the Japanese were unable to withstand the pressure and retreated. The three warships also headed northeast. (10th)</p>

<p>Fancheng - Japanese troops invading the eastern foothills of Dahong Mountain have suffered extremely heavy casualties after continuous engagement with Chinese forces. Japanese troops north of Sanyangdian were subjected to a night attack by Chinese forces on the evening of the 8th. In the fierce battle until the morning of the 9th, the Japanese were unable to withstand the pressure and retreated towards Sanyangdian under cover of fog. The Chinese pursuit force has advanced to the vicinity of ×××××. Of the thousand or so Japanese troops fleeing west from Maping, one group was defeated by Chinese forces at Tongxinzhai, with over a hundred Japanese killed or wounded.

<h3 id="e8">War Situation for the Week - February 3rd to 9th <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing - The military commission spokesman stated that, recently, due to the opening of the Japanese Diet, the Japanese army is making aggressive moves to conceal its military failures in China, deceive its people, and hopefully pass its massive military budget. In particular, in western Suiyuan and southern Guangxi, the Japanese have greatly increased their troop deployments, betting everything on a single throw. Over the past week, our loyal and courageous soldiers have fought with the Japanese army on the northern and southern battlefields with great spirit and fearlessness, and will ultimately shatter the arrogant ambitions of the Japanese. The fierce battle is currently underway. The following is a summary of the operational progress:</p>
<p>Japanese Army in Southern Guangxi</p>
<p>Since reinforcements were greatly increased on the 5th, they have divided into three routes and advanced northwards. One route travels along the Yongwu Highway, attempting to reach Wuming. One route is rapidly advancing along the Yongbin Highway towards Binyang. One route is advancing east from Nanning towards Yongchun, flanking Binyang. They are utilizing both land and air forces, displaying a fierce offensive. They are also desperately publicizing and implementing the so-called "Great Encirclement and Annihilation Battle" to confuse observers. Our side, recognizing their deceit, is adopting a resolute posture and utilizing strong forces to meet the enemy head-on, while simultaneously using large forces to launch a fierce attack on the enemy's rear, cutting the enemy into numerous pieces in the intricate mountainous regions, and encircling and annihilating them separately. Although a small contingent of the enemy on the Yongwu Road managed to bypass and advance to the north of Shuangqiao, the majority have consistently stalled in the Gaofengao area. The enemy on the Yongbin Road is still being besieged by us in the areas north and south of Binyang County. In addition, the enemy blindly charging towards the vicinity of Shanglin is providing our army with an excellent opportunity for capture and annihilation. Therefore, annihilation operations have already begun. Important strongholds such as Yongchun and Gantang have been successively recovered, killing thousands of enemies. Simultaneously, along the Yongqin line, our army, with sharp momentum, has successively captured strongholds such as Bainazhina, Mengna, Bailangwei, Dasi, Guitai, etc., completely controlling the enemy's rear communications, causing the enemy to feel greatly threatened. The enemy's morale has plummeted. In recent days, there have been many instances of suicide among soldiers on the front lines due to war-weariness and fear of battle, with internal anxiety beyond description.</p>
<p>Area of Wuyuan</p>
<p>Since being defeated by us last week, they have continued to reinforce, launching a large-scale assault on us in several routes. Our army had already made thorough deployments, inflicting heavy casualties by attacking them on separate routes, while simultaneously using a large force to bypass the enemy's rear and strike directly at the enemy's stronghold while it was empty. The enemy's return route was cut off by us. Furthermore, all areas west of Suiyuan are being cleared and evacuated, preventing the enemy from establishing a foothold anywhere, forcing them to experience the suffering of being increasingly entrapped, with no way to advance or retreat. The invading enemy has thus been separated by us and is being eliminated piece by piece. In recent days, our northern soldiers have leveraged the natural terrain of the Wula Mountains to unleash powerful attacks on the recklessly advancing enemy, achieving remarkable results. The sacred western Suiyuan battlefield will undoubtedly become the burial ground for the stubborn enemy.</p>
<p>Japanese Army in Hubei Province</p>
<p>After suffering repeated heavy losses in the Tongbai Mountains, the enemy recently gathered remnants of their forces, advancing actively towards the Dahong Mountains from both northern and central Hubei. Our army met the enemy on separate routes, engaging in fierce battles in areas north of the Jingzhong Road. The enemy suffered heavy losses. Strongholds such as Dongerling and Huanggujians were successively recovered, and an assault was launched on Sanyangdian, relentlessly pursuing the defeated enemy, killing over a thousand of them. Simultaneously, our elite forces behind enemy lines took advantage of the situation to launch fierce attacks on Suixian, Yujiadian, and Xujiadian in northern Hubei, inflicting significant damage on the enemy. They then attacked the enemy's core strongholds, southeast and east of Suixian, killing countless enemies. Due to the cleverness and agility of our strategy and tactics, the enemy was caught off guard and suffered crushing blows everywhere. Our army in that area has established an absolutely dominant position and is currently intensifying the mop-up operations against the remaining enemy forces.</p>
<p>Southeastern Shanxi Province</p>
<p>The enemy has suffered repeated heavy blows from our army in the past month, with seven to eight thousand casualties. They are currently trapped in Changzhi, Huguan, Changzi, and other places, afraid to make any aggressive moves. The enemy in the areas of Jiexian, Yuxiang, and Yongji in southern Shanxi has been reinforced by over three thousand troops and over ten artillery pieces in the past week, attempting to resist our attacking army. Our army, taking advantage of our victory, continued to attack, achieving great results in recent days. On the morning of the 7th, enemies from Xin, Wenxi, and Jiangxian County ventured out in several groups, attempting to contain our army, but were repelled in a counter-attack, killing the enemy's battalion commander, Kubota, and several hundred others, capturing many spoils of war. Our battle-hardened warriors, defending the strongholds of Zhongtiao Mountain, repeatedly displayed their skills in killing the enemy during the Spring Festival, providing cause for national excitement.</p>
<p>Chinese Army in Southern Henan Province</p>
<p>On the night of the 5th, taking the enemy by surprise, they launched a fierce attack on the enemy's important stronghold, Wulidian, east of Xinyang. The enemy, numbering about a thousand, was more than halved by our annihilation. The remaining enemy retreated westward, and the area was recaptured. They are currently continuing to press towards Xinyang. Over a thousand enemies in Qinyang, northern Henan, have been invading Mapo in the west for several days, but were also repelled, with many killed or captured.</p>
<p>Remnants of Japanese Troops in Xiaoshan</p>
<p>After continuous attacks, the Chinese have successively captured outposts such as Shiwujian, Hanjia Mountain, Jinjia Mountain, Huzhua Mountain, Dashang Village, Shiyan Mountain, Shijing Mountain, Chang Mountain, Mojia Port, and Jiangtang. The enemies have retreated back to the north bank in disarray, stricken with fear.</p>
<p>Chinese Artillery</p>
<p>Continuous shelling of enemy warships has been exceptionally effective. It is estimated that over the course of a week, a total of fourteen enemy warships, both large and small, have been damaged, and one has been sunk in the waters of Huangshi, Wuxue, Pengze, Xiangkou, and Hukou. The enemy's traffic on the lower Yangtze River has been almost completely controlled by us, causing them to be in a difficult situation of communication and supply issues. (11th)</p>

<h3 id="e10">Recent Sino-Japanese Military Dynamics <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Since the end of winter, the Japanese forces on each front seem to be making moves, but the southwestern and northwestern fronts seem to be more active. In southern Guangxi, the Japanese forces, without diminishing their ferocity despite repeated heavy losses, are instead attempting to circumvent and break through, advancing lightly and recklessly, causing disturbances in the areas between Binyang, Shanglin, and Litang. On the western Suiyuan front, they are making incursions along the river and mountains in several routes towards Wulin, all the way to the border of Suining. Bitter battles are being fought daily along the Baoningsui Highway and between the Daqing Mountains and the western Ula Mountains. Furthermore, south of the Qianjiang River, although the Chinese forces have recovered Xiaoshan, the remnants of the Japanese forces are still putting up a stubborn resistance; on the side of the Dahong Mountains, the Japanese forces, exhausted, are nevertheless reinforcing and intruding. Combining these dynamics, it seems that today's Japan, although in dire straits politically, economically, and diplomatically, still possesses the strength to make some aggressions in its military operations in China. However, is this evidence of Japan's remaining strength or evidence of a spent force?</p>
<p>Speaking of Japan's failures in the economic, diplomatic, and political fields, it is something that no one can deny; even among the Japanese themselves, their dissatisfaction often manifests itself invisibly. Saito's speech, which shook the Japanese political world, seems to criticize the Konoe Statement, which the previous authorities held as a guiding principle, for being too passive and insufficient to compensate the Japanese people's losses. However, its implicit meaning exposes the general Japanese people's significant frustration and disappointment with the military and political authorities. Even if the Japanese authorities punish Saito and censor the record, they cannot deceive the people. The precarious political situation in Japan, which has resulted from this, is continuing to evolve, and it is difficult to predict how it will ultimately unfold. However, what can be recognized is that this kind of political unease is a reflection of its military failures in China. Even in military operations, although the Japanese can still hold some points and lines in China today, or perhaps seize the opportunity to attempt some aggressions, they have achieved no significant success in strategic deployment. Since the war entered its second phase, the Japanese military's actions have become increasingly fragmented and scattered, engaging only in trivial speculation. Its objectives are extremely disorganized, and its actions are sluggish. Moreover, repeated failures and heavy losses have depleted its elite forces; even if it occasionally makes some progress, it has no value in military strategy, nor does it have any stimulating effect domestically or internationally. Recently, the Japanese political commentator, Baba Haruki, said of Japan, "Even if the Japanese army can attack Chongqing in the future, what should be done then?" This is a pointed remark, and, like Saito's speech, it represents the general Japanese people's suspicion of the war of aggression against China and their lack of trust in their authorities. Truly, to speak of military affairs today, it is impossible to separate them from political, economic, and diplomatic aspects. All kinds of phenomena in the rear area are sufficient to affect the success or failure of the military operations on the front lines. The level of hardship of the Japanese military forces in the current stage may not be as great as that of the political, economic, and diplomatic aspects, but compared with the early stage of the war of resistance, the strength and sharpness have been greatly reduced. Judging its situation afterward, it will inevitably get worse and worse. This is not subjective opinion but is inevitable and certain according to reason and principle.</p>
<p>Last autumn, the Japanese zaibatsu, seeing that the war of aggression against China had been making little progress for a long time, took the step of unifying military power in China. As a result, Nishio and Itagaki came to China. What has been their performance in the half-year since then? For example, on both the northern and southern ends of the Yuehan Railway, in the autumn, they advanced from northern Hunan, and this spring, they targeted northern Guangdong. Since they failed to take the offensive simultaneously at both ends to coordinate, this has shown the exhaustion of their strength, and the results, a defeat in Hunan and another defeat in Guangdong, have even more clearly shown that their sharpness has been exhausted. Recently, in the southern Guangxi campaign, they were unable to seek out strongholds in the West River in advance to act as supports for Yongfang, so the invading troops were forced to go deep alone, only able to rely on a single fortress to conflict back and forth. Also, in the northwestern campaign, the Japanese forces only used light cavalry to appear and disappear in the vast desert wilderness, and there were no significant military actions on both sides of the Yellow River to echo. All of these kinds of things, on the one hand, originated from the Japanese military's shortfall in strength, and they could not cope with the extensive battlefield; on the other hand, they can also be seen in the fragmentation of the Japanese military deployment, and the so-called unification of military power in China to facilitate dispatch and deployment is just empty talk. In the southwestern and northwestern wars, in form, the Japanese seemed determined to cut off China's foreign communications; in fact, the Japanese forces in southern Guangxi had more than enough power to cause disturbances, but had insufficient remaining strength to delve deeper, and it was difficult to secure each stronghold near Nanning. Furthermore, there are many external channels in the southwest, and the Japanese are hardly able to block them. As for the northwestern region, from western Suiyuan to northern Ningxia, the area is impoverished, barren, and desolate for thousands of miles, and has little significant value in economic or military terms; and as for Sino-Soviet communications, the line from Linyi to Kulun has always been seldom used by China and the Soviet Union, so the Japanese military's invasion of western Suiyuan is not enough to affect the northwestern transportation routes, which is very clear. Some say: "The Japanese military's recent offensive is only intended to excite domestic and foreign opinion, and will end with the closure of the Diet." Judging the state of the war situation, it is quite close to this; because this kind of action, which lacks careful deployment, can only seek luck by taking risks. It has no value whatsoever in military or political affairs. Moreover, the Chinese army's strategy and strength are advancing rapidly day by day, and even if the Japanese army gains something by taking risks and seeking luck, it will lose it soon after. In the face of his restlessness, and this perseverance, can it be said that we will achieve results? The time of collapse and departure has come.</p>

<p>Washington - Yesterday afternoon, President Roosevelt stood on the steps of the White House and addressed members of the American Youth Citizen Association. He began by recounting the American history of the past decade, then spoke of Finland. When the word "Finland" had just been uttered, the audience applauded non-stop. The President said that 98 percent of Americans sympathize with Finland. The assertion that the Soviet Union will declare war on the United States is sheer nonsense, akin to saying that the United States will declare war on the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union is a dictatorship, similar in its autocracy to other dictatorships in the world. The Soviet Union's war against Finland is a direct invasion of the territory of a neighbor which is very small and will never harm the Soviet Union. I no longer have any illusions about the Soviet Union's experiment in its political system. Twenty years ago, I was very sympathetic to the Russian people. At the beginning of the implementation of communism, I recognized that many Russian leaders were providing education, hygiene, and better opportunities to the hundreds of millions of people who were ignorant and enslaved under the imperial regime. However, I do not like communism. I detest the slaughter of tens of thousands of innocent people. I especially hate the elimination of religion. However, I know that one day Russia will return to the embrace of religion, because four to five thousand years of history have proven that humanity always believes in the true God and will not change because of actions to reject the true God. We all used to hope that Russia could solve its own problems and eventually form a democratically elected government that loves peace and does not interfere with the integrity of its neighbors, but this hope is now either shattered or put on hold for the future. I have heard that some of you are members of the Communist Party. This is not a matter suited to the current sentiment of the people. Although you are legally and constitutionally entitled to call yourself communists, you do not have the right in the United States to change the government and the constitution of this country by any actions. But I am confident that I will have the support of your group and the majority of any other group of American youth. What you and I represent is essentially the same thing. When I step down from office in the future, it will be your responsibility to continue to strive to protect free politics and to improve its working methods and efficiency. We should especially help all those who have proven their hard work and want to improve the happiness of our people every year. May you each maintain noble ideals, stand firm, and gain eternal joy. May this be your aspiration. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<p>Washington - President Roosevelt delivered a speech to the members of the American Youth Citizen Association at the White House today, discussing the United States' attitude towards the Soviet Union. He said, "The Soviet Union is an absolutely autocratic country, no different from other autocratic countries in the world." Regarding the war between Finland and the Soviet Union, he expressed deep sympathy for Finland and declared that he was willing to provide financial assistance. Diplomatic circles here have commented that there is an unbridgeable gap between democracy and dictatorship, whether it is a communist or national socialist dictatorship. As for the assistance to Finland, Lewis, chairman of the Industrial Improvement Association, recently expressed his opposition, which is completely contrary to the president's views. It can be seen that the president is willing to sever ties with the extreme left in the country, thereby comforting the conservatives. This aspect is extremely important in domestic politics and is sufficient to greatly influence the election campaign. (Havas, 10th)</p>

<p>Washington - The U.S. fleet's naval exercises in the Pacific are only sixty days away. Diplomatic and naval circles here unanimously believe that these exercises have serious repercussions for the United States' national defense and foreign policy. Although U.S. naval officials say that these exercises have nothing to do with foreign policy, experienced naval diplomatic observers all recognize that these exercises have an important significance in diplomacy, fully demonstrating that the United States will show its strength in its border at the appropriate time. As U.S.-Japan relations become more tense this year, this type of exercise has a significant meaning for Japan. (United Press, 11th)</p>

<p>Tokyo - At the Budget Committee yesterday, Diet member Yutani claimed that the actions of the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee have enabled the US to lend another 20 million US dollars to China, which clearly shows that the US is intensifying its pressure on Japan. According to Prime Minister Yonai's statement in the Diet the day before yesterday, if the US takes a more pressing attitude towards Japan, Japan is prepared to take responsive steps. Considering the current US attitude of continuing to lend to China, the situation mentioned by Prime Minister Yonai can be said to have already occurred. He asked what methods the government will use to deal with it. The Foreign Minister replied that the Japanese government has not received formal notification of the US intention to lend to China. He also said that the Japanese government is currently considering various ways to cope with the new situation, but these measures cannot be announced at this time. (Eleventh day, United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Washington - Well-informed sources in Congress claimed yesterday that the Senate Foreign Relations Committee intends to lend a new loan of 20 million US dollars to China, which, while reducing congressional pressure for an embargo against Japan, Republican Senator Johnson claimed that the embargo situation is "mysterious."

<p>Tokyo - The general questioning at the House of Representatives Budget Committee will end on the 12th of this month. Starting from the 13th, it will switch to questioning by various subcommittees. However, because the questioners at the general meeting only finished nine people by the 10th, and on that day, the questioning by Mr. Miyoshi Nobufusa needs to continue on the 12th. Others include Zhu Song Xieyilang (Minseito), Ogasawara Sankuro (Seiyukai Nakajima faction), Nakamura Sanzojo (Minseito), Tsukamoto Juzo (Social Masses Party), Oyama Ryo (Shikyoku Doshikai), Nagawa Kanichi (Seiyukai Kuhara faction), Sakamoto Sotaro (First Control Room), and Matsumura Kozo (Seiyukai Unification Faction). As such, after discussion on the 9th, it was decided to extend the questioning to the 14th, with the subcommittee starting on the 15th. It is also planned that the subcommittee will be completed on the 19th, with a decision-making meeting held on the 20th. (Eleventh day, Domei dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e14">Difficulties in Adjusting Japan-Soviet Relations; Negotiations on Various Pending Issues Stalled; Japanese Assemblymen Frequently Ask the Government Questions <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo - Foreign Minister Arita expressed optimism about Japan-Soviet relations in a speech he delivered in the House of Representatives on the first of this month. Unexpectedly, before the words were even cold, the news of the dissolution of the Nomonhan Border Demarcation Joint Committee was announced on the same day, which surprised public opinion. According to Foreign Minister Arita's explanation, the dissolution of the committee was only announced at 4 p.m. on the first of this month, so he could not mention it in his speech. On the 7th of this month, when the House of Representatives Budget Committee met, several assemblymen raised questions about the relationship between Japan and the Soviet Union. The details of what happened are not fully known to outsiders, and are now recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Minseito assemblyman Matsumoto first asked, "Since the Japanese government is adjusting its relations with the Soviet Union, I wonder if it intends to find a way to make the Soviet Union stop assisting the Chinese Nationalist government?" Foreign Minister Arita immediately replied, "The Japanese people must still be wary of the Soviet Union and must not be negligent in the slightest." He also said, "The Anti-Comintern Pact is not aimed at the Soviet Union. For this reason, Japan's attempt to adjust relations with the Soviet Union does not conflict with the Anti-Comintern Pact." Then he answered another assemblyman's question, saying, "In my opinion, Germany and the Soviet Union's signing of a non-aggression pact does not mean abandoning the Anti-Comintern Pact. Japan still firmly adheres to this pact." Minseito assemblyman Kuboi then asked about the deadlock in the work of the Nomonhan Border Demarcation Committee. Foreign Minister Arita replied that a small committee could be formed on general boundary issues to discuss them anew in order to seek a solution. Land Minister Hata also replied, "The continuous intrusion of a small number of Soviet troops across the boundary line has made it impossible to resolve the boundary issue. The boundary work was originally the responsibility of the military authorities of both sides, and then it was transferred to the diplomatic representatives to preside over, and some progress has indeed been made."</p>
<p>At this point, assemblyman Matsu further asked, "It is rumored that after the Nomonhan Armistice Agreement was concluded, Japanese officers and soldiers were illegally captured by the Red Army when they were searching for the remains of fallen soldiers in the area based on the agreement. I wonder if this is true?" Land Minister Hata avoided answering directly, only saying that he would find a way to explain the implementation of the Nomonhan Armistice Agreement at an appropriate opportunity in the near future. In addition, Yamaoka, the chief of the police bureau of the Ministry of the Interior, also submitted a report to the House of Representatives Budget Committee, stating that regarding the deadlock in the work of the Nomonhan Border Demarcation Committee, "The Japan Times actually published this news on July 30, two days before the official announcement of the matter. The police bureau therefore detained the newspaper on that day." The assemblymen paid considerable attention after hearing this report. The news of the "Japan Times" caused a great shock, but the authorities only officially released it two days later and announced at the same time that there were two other joint committees organized by representatives of Japan and the Soviet Union, which had never been mentioned before, and would meet in the short term to discuss general boundary issues and other ways to resolve pending issues. The purpose of this was obviously to correct the negative impression caused by the news published in the "Japan Times." As for other negotiations conducted by Japan and the Soviet Union, Foreign Minister Arita's main answers are as follows: (1) Regarding the issue of concluding a long-term fisheries agreement, there has been no progress in the negotiations between the two sides. This year, the temporary agreement will still be used as the basis. (2) Regarding the issue of concluding a business agreement, the two sides are negotiating in Moscow, and there are still some difficult points that need to be resolved. (3) Regarding the issue of protecting Japan's interests in Sakhalin Island, the Japanese government has repeatedly protested to the Soviet Union, but as of now, the situation has improved very little.

<h3 id="e15">Japanese Assemblymen Express Distrust of the Wang Puppet Government <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>Beijing - When the House of Representatives Budget Committee met on the 8th of this month, Seiyukai assemblyman Ando Masazumi asked about the relationship between the Jingwei "new regime" and the Three Principles of the People of the Kuomintang, saying that the anti-Japanese and pro-communist Chinese Nationalist government and Wang both claim to adhere to the Three Principles of the People, "but in fact, the Three Principles of the People is communism." Therefore, there is still a possibility of causing an anti-Japanese movement in the future. Director-General of the Asia Development Board, Lieutenant General Yanagawa, replied at the time, "The interpretation of the Three Principles of the People is very broad and often involves ambiguity. According to Wang Jingwei's explanation, this doctrine is based on Orientalism. He has been influenced by Japanese thought and has revised some of the principles included in the Three Principles of the People. In my personal opinion, Japan must be careful to prevent the Three Principles of the People advocated by Wang from tending towards anti-Japanese and pro-communist doctrines."

<p>Hong Kong - A Tokyo dispatch states that a certain assemblyman of the orthodox faction of the Seiyukai raised a question in the Budget Committee, asking the government to explain whether the government can ensure the safety of national defense if there are no problems with the expenses required for the military expansion plan of the army and navy listed in the 1940-1941 budget案. Navy Minister Yoshida said that national defense can be guaranteed without problems if the above-mentioned naval expansion plan is based on the Second and Third Vinson Plans, which are related to each other. Japan's naval replenishment plan is divided into the 1937-1938 naval replenishment and the 1940 naval replenishment plans, both of which were formulated by the authorities after careful study of the Vinson Plan. Land Minister Hata Shunroku said that the army believes that the military expansion plan must be re-established in order to ensure the minimum amount of armaments, achieve the goals of the China Incident, and adapt to the ever-changing international situation. The plan formulated by the army is based on national strength and is a minimum requirement. The army is determined to strive for the complete safety of national defense. (Eleventh day dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e18">Central Government's Instructions; Discussing the Scope of Constitutional Government <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing - Since the Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang resolved on November 6 last year to convene the National Assembly on November 12 of this year, all parties have attached great importance to this. The government is also actively preparing for the assembly. However, during this preparation period, there are still many issues that all parties are eager to understand, such as the powers of the National Assembly, the issue of representative elections, the issue of the draft constitution, and the way in which all parties study constitutional government, etc. It is now learned that the central government has concrete instructions to the party departments of various provinces and cities and other relevant agencies regarding these issues. The content is specially explored and recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(A) The Meaning of Implementing Constitutional Government</p>
<p>(1) Implementing constitutional government is a consistent proposition of our party. The Premier's lifelong efforts and the President's years of struggle have all been aimed at realizing constitutional government as the main policy. Only our party has adhered to the advocacy of democratic constitutionalism for fifty years. Therefore, the decision of our party to convene the National Assembly this time is actually to realize the consistent proposition of our party for decades. All our party comrades and the whole country should approach it with the utmost loyalty and prudence. (2) The relationship between constitutional government and political tutelage. Although the division of the three periods of military government, political tutelage, and constitutional government contains the meaning of gradual progress, the government can implement constitutional government before the work of political tutelage is completed in order to respond to the requirements of the times and promote political progress, and continue to complete the work of political tutelage after the start of constitutional government. This is something that everyone can appreciate from the Premier's will and the President's speech at the National Political Council in September last year. Therefore, on the one hand, we demand the implementation of constitutional government, and on the other hand, we demand that after the implementation of constitutional government, we continue to carry out the unfinished work of political tutelage.</p>
<p>(B) Election and Powers of the National Assembly</p>
<p>(1) Election. The National Assembly Organization Law and the National Representative Election Law have been solemnly promulgated by the National Government in accordance with legislative procedures, and have been implemented by the National Government. The representatives elected in accordance with the election law should be valid in principle, except for those who are near to and have evidence of rebellion, and should be dealt with by the government in accordance with the law. (2) Powers. According to Article 1 of the Organization Law, the task of this National Assembly is to formulate the constitution and determine the date of implementation of the constitution. Its nature is purely a constitution-making organ. As for the exercise of the powers conferred by the constitution, it remains to be seen in the future. The reason why the National Assembly Organization Law elected in accordance with the constitution does not stipulate that this National Assembly should exercise the powers conferred by the constitution is because the constitution should stipulate which agency should implement the constitution. If the Organization Law stipulates that the constitution-making National Assembly should exercise the powers conferred by the constitution, it would be tantamount to determining the issues that should be determined in the constitution by the Organization Law, limiting the power of the constitutional organ by the Organization Law, predetermining the content of the constitution, and granting it in advance, which is not in accordance with the law for the constitution-making organ.</p>
<p>(C) Issues Concerning the Draft Constitution</p>
<p>(1) The legality of the draft constitution. The draft constitution announced by the National Government was drafted by the Legislative Yuan, which gathered public law scholars from all over the country, based on the Outline of National Reconstruction and the achievements of the administration during the period of political tutelage, after two years of effort. After the completion of the first draft, it was publicly solicited for criticism from the people all over the country within six months, and then it was carefully studied by the Central Executive Committee of our party, and the opinions of the people all over the country were incorporated as much as possible, and it was designated as a draft and sent to the National Government for promulgation. Therefore, the promulgation of the draft has actually completed all the procedures, and its legality is beyond doubt. The National Government must submit the draft to the National Assembly in accordance with the Outline of National Reconstruction. (2) The National Assembly's right to decide. The National Assembly naturally has the right to decide on the draft constitution. The opinions of our party comrades on the draft constitution can be contributed to the Central Committee within a certain period of time, and submitted to the National Assembly after verification by the Central Committee. The claims of the National Political Council's Constitutional Government Promotion Association on the draft constitution can also be sent to the government and transferred to the National Assembly for adoption after being passed by the National Political Council. The opinions of other legal organizations on the draft constitution will also be submitted to the National Assembly for consideration through the introduction of representatives of the National Assembly or other legal means.</p>
<p>(D) Discussion on Constitutional Government Issues</p>
<p>(1) Meetings. Regarding meetings to discuss constitutional government issues, such as seminars, discussion meetings, and lectures, etc., each province and city will be convened by each city's party department and government, together with the local council, in order to collect public opinion widely, and use it as an aid to constitutional government propaganda. (2) Organizing groups. Before the end of this war, the government cannot but set necessary restrictions on the organization of groups for the study of constitutional government, so as to avoid abuses. In Chongqing, the Constitutional Government Promotion Association of the National Political Council is a legitimate organ for studying constitutional government and contributing opinions to the government. For the sake of concentrating opinions, there is no need for other organizations. If it is necessary to organize in other provinces and cities, the party department and government of each province and city must also organize a constitutional government research group in conjunction with the council to lead the research on constitutional government issues in each place. (3) Scope of discussion. All remarks that oppose constitutional government, violate the Three Principles of the People, and distort constitutional government should be included in the list of bans. From now on, party members of our party must not violate the established policies of our party and publish remarks that oppose constitutional government. (Eleventh day dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e19">American Reporter Young Still Not Released; Editor of Yomiuri Shimbun Summoned by Japanese Police Bureau <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo - American International News Service correspondent in Tokyo, Young, has not been released since he was arrested by the Japanese police bureau on January 1 of this year. "News of the News" Weekly Special recently carried a story saying that Suzuki, the editor of the international edition of the Yomiuri Shimbun, had dealings with Young and was recently summoned by the police bureau to clarify what kind of relationship he had with Young. Young has lived in Japan for ten years and knows many important figures in Japanese society. He is familiar with Japanese customs and can do Japanese-style dances. When he traveled to China, he repeatedly sent manuscripts to the Yomiuri Shimbun, which the newspaper adopted and published one by one. The president of the newspaper is also a friend of Young. When Young arrived in Shanghai from Chongqing, he made a statement to the reporter of the Shanghai Continental Newspaper, saying, "The situation in Japan this winter will definitely be very bleak." At this point, the Japanese authorities began to pay close attention to Young's words and deeds. After Hearst, the general manager of the American International News Service, heard of Young's arrest, he was furious and immediately telegraphed Young, warning him, "All Hearst's newspapers and periodicals publish news impartially and powerfully. What you have done is 'shameful'," etc. The conclusion of "News of the News" is that in the past, there were many boring foreigners who engaged in other work in Japan under the guise of foreign newspaper reporters. For the sake of Japan and for the sake of foreign reporters themselves, these scum should be eliminated." (Eighth day, Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>The English-language Great American Evening Post said that American International News Service correspondent Young, after coming to Shanghai in October last year, spoke freely to a reporter of the Continental Newspaper on October 20 about the lack of important materials in Japan, the sharp decline in foreign trade, the turbulent political situation, and unfavorable foreign relations. This is the main reason why Young was recently arrested in Japan. According to a Tokyo newspaper, the Japanese side has carefully investigated Young's words and writings ever since. (Note: Young's statement to the reporter of the Continental Newspaper was translated and published in the Shen Bao on October 21 last year.)</p>

At the same time, Lewis also asked President Roosevelt to inquire whether AFL President Green would be willing to accept this proposal. According to Lewis's proposal, the Industrial Improvement Association and the AFL will hold a joint conference to establish a merger bill between the two associations. He is willing not to seek any position in the merged AFL. (Eleventh day, Reuters dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e21">US Under Secretary of State's Mission to Europe; Seeking Sound Post-War Reconstruction Economy; To Achieve Lasting Peace Goals <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>Washington - Secretary of State Hull claimed here yesterday while hosting newspaper reporters that post-war peace and economic soundness are the objectives that the United States seeks through talks with other neutral countries, and are also the mission of Under Secretary of State Welles' visit to Europe. The United States has long strived to promote basic concepts in order to formulate the methods and procedures for the stable period of international relations after the end of the war. There are two main points of this policy: one is the reduction of armaments, and the other is the adoption of sound and free commercial policies by various countries. If there is to be economic soundness rather than an all-powerful system after the war, it is necessary to achieve the above-mentioned goals for the sake of the world. When peace comes in the future, it is hoped that all countries will give extremely sincere understanding and restraint to the basic principles necessary for a peaceful world. (Eleventh day, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Washington - After President Roosevelt sent Under Secretary of State Welles to Europe for inspection, Secretary of State Hull then announced that he would hold talks with various neutral countries. Upon hearing the news, people from all walks of life in the United States were quite perplexed and confused, but one point that all parties agreed on was that President Roosevelt still held the same views as before on the fundamental principles on which the European solution should be based. In other words, the main condition for world peace is to eliminate the attempts of various dictatorial countries to dominate and the theories they represent. Then, the reasons why President Roosevelt launched the "peace offensive" can be explained by the following three assumptions: (1) The US government deeply feels that if the belligerent countries want to use military force to resolve the current European war, they must make endless sacrifices. As a result, Europe will eventually fall into an irrecoverable situation. President Roosevelt intends to contact various neutral countries in order to seek a peaceful solution and avoid suffering for the belligerent countries and even the neutral countries. (2) President Roosevelt has probably obtained special intelligence about the truth of the situation in Germany, knowing that the country is in a desperate situation economically and politically, and is afraid that the National Socialist Party authorities will take risks, causing the country and even the entire Europe to encounter a catastrophe. Therefore, he advocates restoring peace as soon as possible. (3) President Roosevelt may, as he claimed, only want to obtain a more detailed report on the European situation, especially the German situation. Therefore, he sent Welles to Europe on the one hand, and exchanged views with various neutral countries on the other hand. In any case, observers believe that these two actions are not detrimental to the basic interests of Britain and France and the belligerent countries of Europe. As far as the current situation is concerned, Roosevelt and Hull do not believe that the views held by both sides of the belligerent countries are likely to be close. Therefore, this launch is not a direct attempt to restore peace, but an attempt to carry out a reconnaissance work. In other words, on the one hand, Vice Secretary Welles will personally go to Europe to inspect the situation, and on the other hand, he will hold talks with various neutral countries in order to ascertain the true views of the belligerent countries and the neutral countries on the future peace. Therefore, it can be seen that the talks that the United States will conduct with various related countries in the future will not only not have any immediate consequences, but will also be based on the assumption that Britain and France will achieve victory. If victory in the future belongs to the two dictatorial countries of Germany and the Soviet Union, then those countries can force other countries in Europe to accept their will, and there will be no need to conduct talks at all. Judging from the launch of this talk by the State Department at this time, it can be seen that it deeply believes that the views held by Britain and France will eventually win. (Eleventh day, Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Washington - Well-informed sources believe that officials here all know that if the Hitler regime still exists, any attempt to establish a sound and stable international policy will be impossible. (Eleventh day, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>New York - The local newspapers have made many comments on President Roosevelt's dispatch of Under Secretary of State Welles to Europe. Although officials said that this trip was purely for inspection purposes, most newspapers did not believe it, and most believed that the President's move was an attempt to end the current European war, and warned the people not to have excessive hopes for Welles' trip. The "World News" stated that if Welles could find a common basis for conducting peace talks between Britain and Germany, it would not be impossible for the President to put forward peace proposals. As for whether Welles can find this basis, it is extremely foolish to make speculations at this time. What can be asserted is that the information received by President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull is no more detailed than what we know. Therefore, the authorities need to make further investigations. In any case, we do not need to be pessimistic about the future of the situation. (Tenth day, Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e22">Berlin Maintains Silence <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>Berlin - Officials here have remained silent on US Under Secretary of State Welles' visit to Germany, without any expression. At the same time, the German press has not commented on it, but political figures have felt great "interest" in this matter. (Eleventh day, United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>The Hague - The local "Tele-News" correspondent in Berlin recently sent a telegram saying that German officials were very concerned after hearing that US Under Secretary of State Welles was about to visit Europe, but on the surface they still pretended to be indifferent. In fact, the National Socialist Party authorities have declared to foreign reporters more than once that "only the United States can launch peace talks." One thing that deserves attention is that before the outbreak of the European War, when US President Roosevelt sent a telegram calling for peace, German leader Hitler and the leaders of the National Socialist Party were very indifferent to it. But this time, they felt great interest in Welles' trip. Their attitude was obviously different before and after. Moreover, German commentators mostly compared Welles' trip to the trip of the late US President Wilson's Colonel House to Europe during the last European War. However, the result of Colonel House's visit to Europe did not restore peace, but made the United States join the Allied Powers and fight together to defend freedom. This is something that must be known. (Eleventh day, Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e23">Rome Recognizes Difficulty in Achieving Success <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>Rome: The news that U.S. Under Secretary of State Welles is coming to Europe for inspection and is scheduled to travel by ship to Italy on the 17th of this month has been received with great interest by the general public, who believe that the Italian government will be sympathetic to Welles' mission. It is generally believed that President Roosevelt's purpose is to explore the possibility of mediating peace in the future. The U.S. government attaches equal importance to both "Fascist Rome" and "Vatican Rome," as evidenced by the simultaneous arrival of Under Secretary Welles and President Roosevelt's personal representative to the Vatican, Mr. Taylor, in Italy. However, some sources say that Welles' mission is unlikely to achieve any results. (Havas, 11th)</p>
<p>Rome: Although the news of U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Welles' visit to Europe has aroused great interest in political circles here, the general public cannot help but doubt the actual results of U.S. Secretary of State Hull's discussions with neutral countries on peace issues. Only one Italian newspaper commented on the matter, saying that President Wilson's previous actions have not been forgotten, and President Roosevelt's repeated speeches are still fresh in people's minds. It is almost impossible to create hope that Washington can launch an initiative that will produce practical results. A semi-official Vatican source said that anything that can clarify the situation and help the peace movement can only be viewed with goodwill. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<h3 id="e24">Dutch Public Opinion Expresses Welcome <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>Amsterdam: Although official circles here have not expressed an opinion on the mission of U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Welles' visit to Europe, various newspapers have stated that the Netherlands welcomes such steps, even if it does not hold great hope for them. The Dutch government learned of this U.S. action after receiving a telegram from the Dutch ambassador to the United States, which seemed unexpected. It is currently studying the telegram. As far as the Netherlands is concerned, no informal or diplomatic talks have actually begun. A Rotterdam newspaper said that Germany and Italy may not trust Welles because the United States sympathizes with the Allied Powers. Furthermore, the U.S. plan does not involve Finland and the Soviet Union, which is also a weakness. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<h3 id="e25">Balkan Countries Conduct Staff Talks; Aim to Establish Mutual Assistance Measures; Economic Conference Scheduled for May <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>London: According to sources in the political circles of the Balkan Peninsula countries, staff members of the Balkan Entente countries (Greece, Turkey, Romania, Yugoslavia) will conduct talks in accordance with the agreement established at the permanent political conference in the capital of Yugoslavia on the 2nd of this month. The goal is to establish mutual assistance measures, that is, if one of the Entente countries is attacked by another country in the Balkan Peninsula or any country outside the peninsula, the other Entente countries should immediately come to its aid. It is expected that the staff members of the four countries will conduct talks with strict confidentiality. This is not to keep the military agreements established by these countries secret, but because these countries do not want to publish this information to avoid causing misunderstandings by other countries. As for the policy of active assistance to Finland by Britain and France, the Entente countries deeply agree and believe that British and French aid to Finland indirectly helps the Balkan Entente countries. Because the Soviet Union has concentrated all its efforts on Northern Europe, it will inevitably have no time to attend to other matters, so Southeastern Europe can remain calm. Regarding this, according to British informed sources, the policy of British and French aid to Finland is not only supported by the Balkan Entente countries, but also more likely to win the sympathy of the United States. U.S. Under Secretary of State Welles will inevitably discuss the war between Finland and the Soviet Union with British and French authorities when he comes to Europe in the future. The hope of success in this regard is greater than the hope of restoring peace in Europe. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<p>Yugoslav Capital: The Balkan Entente countries conference previously passed a resolution to convene a Balkan Entente countries economic conference. It has been learned from here that the Yugoslav cabinet has begun preparations for the conference, which will be held in May, possibly in the Yugoslav capital. (Haitong, 11th)</p>
<p>Budapest: The Hungarian Foreign Ministry mouthpiece, "Magyar Hírlap," published a surprising editorial yesterday, heavily criticizing Romania for attempting to expand the existing military agreements between the Balkan countries into a military alliance against Hungary and Bulgaria. Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu's remarks denied that Romania was willing to make territorial concessions to Hungary and Bulgaria. The newspaper strongly stated that Hungary is willing to continue to pursue a peaceful policy, but it would be a mistake to think that the Romania-Hungary issue can be resolved with a government gazette, a commission, or a minority rights law.

<p>Paris: The Chamber of Deputies held a closed-door meeting from the day before yesterday to discuss various measures the government intends to take to increase military strength. It was not until 6:30 PM yesterday that the meeting was opened to the public, and the vote of confidence motion jointly signed by the leaders of the various parties was passed unanimously with 534 votes to zero. The motion stated, "After the government authorities made explanations in the closed-door meeting, the discussions among the deputies were filled with patriotism. The Chamber of Deputies is deeply impressed by the government's efforts to enhance the country's material and spiritual strength. It hereby expresses its trust and supports it in achieving the final victory with the assistance of the parliament." Speaker Herriot also delivered a speech after the vote, stating, "The result of this debate has cleared away certain doubts. Not only has Prime Minister Daladier revealed his sincerity and explained everything to us, but the parliament, as the representative of all parties and elements of the French nation, has also obtained clear evidence of this. In short, the spirit of national unity in our country is based on freedom and patriotism, and cannot be destroyed by anything. This debate in the Chamber of Deputies over the past two days has promoted and enhanced this spirit." (Havas, 11th)</p>
<p>Washington: After the passage of the vote of confidence in the government, political figures here have been deeply impressed. They believe that at a time when U.S. Under Secretary of State Welles is about to go to Europe, the French Chamber of Deputies has made this statement, which proves that the country is determined to make the elimination of the national socialist crisis a preliminary condition for peace negotiations. On the German side, Minister Frick's speech yesterday was extremely strong, which is not conducive to Welles' mission. (Havas, 11th)</p>

<p>Brussels: The semi-official Belgian News Agency recently issued a message stating that German Propaganda Minister Goebbels invited eight journalists from neutral countries to a villa near Berlin today and made a speech to them, stating, "Germany is determined to find comprehensive solutions to various major problems, thereby establishing a new order. Therefore, it will not make any concessions on the issues of Austria, Czechoslovakia, and Poland. Shameful and useless peace conditions will only allow all the problems in Europe to remain, which is not what Germany wants to accept." Regarding the colonial issue, it was not acute before the outbreak of this war, but it should also be included in Germany's war aims thereafter. Regarding the issue of neutrality, Germany is willing to respect all neutral countries, but opposes hypocritical neutrality. Because the country and the people are two and two and two. If a country here declares a neutral policy and allows its people to be manipulated by foreign forces and deliberately show hostility to Germany, it is hypocritical neutrality. Because no matter what country, if it wants to enjoy the benefits of neutrality, it must abide by certain obligations, and it cannot use democracy and freedom of the press as an excuse.

<p>London: The Admiralty announced that as a result of an enemy air raid in the North Sea on Friday, the British military fishing vessels "Bovene" and "Royal Battery" were sunk, losing four officers and eighteen sailors. It is reported that German aircraft descended from the clouds and first sank the "Bovene," and then fired two aerial torpedoes at the "Royal Battery." The "Bovene" weighed 290 tons, and the "Royal Battery" weighed 351 tons. It was also disclosed that several merchant ships were also attacked on Friday, and three were damaged, but none sank. For example, the "Cliveden" (3106 tons) was able to sail into the port on its own after being bombed and strafed. The "Boston Merchant" (371 tons) was also strafed and bombed, but the ship was not hit by a bomb, but was damaged because a bomb exploded in the water. The "Formaster" (306 tons) was damaged by bombing and has been towed to the port. None of these three merchant ships were armed. (Reuters, 11th)</p>

<p>Chongqing: Newspapers here believe that the "Saito Incident" that occurred on February 2nd fully demonstrates the internal collapse of Japanese aggression. What Saito said not only questioned the "East Asia New Order" and whether the Konoe Declaration was reasonable, but also questioned the power of Wang Jingwei's government. "Saito's position is completely on the side of the aggressors, but it also shows that the Japanese warlords are no longer able to end their war against China." However, the Japanese parliament has no power to discuss the war, nor does it have the power to discuss peace treaties. This parliament is purely a toy in the hands of the warlords. The power of the political parties in this kind of parliament cannot withstand a kick from the Japanese warlords. Therefore, the only way for the Japanese people to express their true will is through a major revolution. (Associated Press, 6th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: When the Japanese House of Representatives met on the 2nd of this month, Saito, a member of the Minseitō Party, raised an important inquiry. The following is a translation based on the official record of the proceedings:</p>
<p>"Since the outbreak of the China Incident, it has been two and a half years. Japan has now encountered various serious problems at home and abroad. After the formation of the current cabinet, Prime Minister Yonai issued a statement on some current policies, but the content was extremely empty. The declarations he made at the plenary meeting of the Diet were also unclear. After all, what is the cabinet's understanding of national policy is not something that these statements can explain. I hereby raise inquiries on the following three points: (1) the handling of the China Incident, (2) international issues, and (3) domestic issues, with particular emphasis on the first point. I will also present my humble opinions and ask the Prime Minister to frankly explain his views.</p>
<h3 id="e32">Handling of the China Incident Has Achieved Nothing So Far <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>How to handle the China Incident is a major issue at present and is the most important of our country's political issues. Therefore, not only I want to know the truth, but also people across the country want to know it. What I want to know is what the future of the China Incident will be, how long it will take, and what the government's proposed solution plan is. The whole country is awaiting answers from this Diet.</p>
<p>The previous Konoe Cabinet resigned without resolving the China Incident. What about the Hiranuma Cabinet? You all know it. The Abe Cabinet declared that it would handle the China Incident with all its strength, but in the end, it achieved nothing and resigned en masse. Now that the current cabinet has taken the stage, it can take this opportunity to jointly review this issue with the people and dare to ask Prime Minister Yonai frankly about the scope and content of the plan for handling the China Incident. These two questions must be answered.</p>
<h3 id="e33">Significant Military Losses Due to Miscalculations <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>In my opinion, regarding the current incident, regardless of how China handles it, there are indeed some miscalculations on the Japanese side. We originally decided not to expand the situation and to seek a solution on the spot, but this policy was rejected due to the challenge from the Chinese side. Since then, day after day and month after month, the incident has expanded to this extent. The miscalculations on the Chinese side are self-evident. I have a document here that is worthy of your consideration. The Cabinet Intelligence Bureau published a weekly report on December 13th of last year, containing an article written by the Director of the Intelligence Department of the Staff Department of the Chinese Expeditionary Force, stating that the Sino-Japanese War was caused by China, especially General Chiang Kai-shek, not clearly understanding Japan and accusing Japan of not studying and not understanding China. In other words, the China Incident was caused by the lack of understanding between China and Japan. In fact, even if both countries make the necessary reflections, a large-scale incident is still unavoidable. The eventual occurrence of the Lugouqiao Incident is the destiny of China and Japan and cannot be avoided.</p>
<p>It is no longer in doubt which country will win this war, so it must be resolved as soon as possible. Eliminating the various misfortunes between the Chinese and Japanese nations and laying the foundation for peace is not only the responsibility of Japanese politicians, but also the responsibility of Chinese politicians. As for how to eliminate these misfortunes and how to ensure future stability, this is the only issue at present. Regarding this, the views of China and Japan must be considered together. However, one point that cannot be ignored in handling the China Incident is that the Japanese people and the entire nation have suffered great sacrifices in the past two and a half years. The losses suffered by the people, such as life, property, and freedom, are not easy to compensate. Although it is called an "incident," it is a large-scale war that the Japanese Empire has never experienced. According to Minister Hata's report in the House of Representatives yesterday, the land occupied by the Japanese army is as large as the entire Japanese Empire. This is due to the heroic fighting of the Japanese soldiers. So far, about 100,000 Japanese soldiers have been killed in battle, and hundreds of thousands of officers and soldiers have been injured. Those who speak of handling the China Incident cannot but take this into consideration.</p>
<h3 id="e34">Gambling with the Nation's Fate, Not Caring About Throwing Everything In <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>Our country fought with China forty years ago and with Russia thirty years ago. You should all be able to recall them. In these two wars, our country threw everything in for the survival of the nation, but the scope of the sacrifices cannot be compared with the current war. What, then, is the way to restore peace? This must be explained. Considering our country's history and its future, the resolution of the China Incident, if it does not compensate the sacrifices suffered by the entire nation, as in previous wars, it will be difficult for the entire nation to accept it, not to mention the soldiers on the front lines. (Applause from the deputies) Whether the government is preparing for this is what I urgently want to know. Prime Minister Yonai once said that the government has formulated an unchanging policy for handling the China Incident. This policy is probably the statement issued by former Prime Minister Konoe on December 22, 1938.</p>
<h3 id="e35">Doubts About the Five Points of the Konoe Declaration Cannot be Avoided <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>In my opinion, I cannot help but doubt this statement. I am not opposed to this statement, nor do I disapprove of it. My approval or disapproval must be decided after the government's explanation. I hope you understand this. Since today is the day of inquiry, the concerns we have must be explained. I dare to ask you to also base your thinking on my spirit. There are five points in the Konoe Declaration: (1) respect for Chinese sovereignty, (2) no territorial ambitions in China, and no demand for reparations, (3) Japan does not want to monopolize the Chinese economy, (4) respect for the legitimate rights of third countries in China, and (5) withdrawal of Japanese troops from various places, except for anti-communist areas such as the vicinity of Inner Mongolia. This statement was not only addressed to China and Japan, but also to the whole world. Its content cannot be changed, otherwise Japan will lose face internationally, which goes without saying. Wang Jingwei has made efforts to establish a "New Central Government" in accordance with the spirit of the Konoe Declaration and has repeatedly stated that this statement will not harm the well-being of the Chinese people. According to his explanation, Japan has abandoned imperialism in military and economic terms and said that China and Japan should conduct peace negotiations on an equal footing. Japan should not treat China as a victor at all, and the peace conditions should not hinder China's freedom and independence. If this is the case, then no one can oppose the realization of peace. Wang Jingwei's statement has the above meaning. It has been more than a year since it was issued. During this period, Wang has worked hard to carry out the peace movement. He personally experienced hardships and suffered great sacrifices. The Chinese people and General Chiang Kai-shek's faction have attacked him. Observing the situation from Wang's standpoint, I deeply feel that he cannot abandon the statement he made.</p>
<h3 id="e36">Increased Burden on the People; How Will the Sacrifices be Compensated? <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>If not, the peace movement and the plan to establish a "new regime" will inevitably fail. When I mention this, I want to ask about the scope and content of the government's proposed plan to resolve the China Incident. In my opinion, the government's answer must be that it fully respects Chinese sovereignty, that is, it will avoid interfering in China's internal affairs and diplomacy in the future. Any action that has the suspicion of interference is an infringement of Chinese sovereignty. In addition, Japan does not intend to seize Chinese territory or demand reparations. I do not know how much our country has spent on the China Incident, but judging from the military expenses approved by the House of Representatives, it has reached 1.2 billion yen. The total may be between 20 billion and 30 billion yen, or perhaps even more. After our country has spent so much military expenses, it has not gained a single cent in China. All the expenses will be borne by our national people, and even future generations will have to bear them forever.</p>
<p>Also, although the saying that the Chinese economy will be developed by our country in the future is very popular, according to the Konoe Declaration, our country cannot demand to monopolize the Chinese economy, nor can it demand that the new China restrict the rights and interests of third countries. If this is the case, I cannot help but be confused. Our country's politicians have loudly called on the people, saying, "The goal of the current policy is to exclude the forces of European and American countries from China, liberate China, not allow it to be exploited by European and American countries and be in a colonial position, and make China once again belong to the Chinese people." This kind of statement is groundless and is completely different from the Konoe Declaration. I do not know why it is still said today.</p>
<h3 id="e37">Absolutely Believe That It Is Impossible To Withdraw Troops From China <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>As for the issue of troop withdrawal, according to Wang Jingwei, troop withdrawal is the most important point in the Konoe Declaration and should be implemented simultaneously on all front lines as soon as possible. Only the area of Inner Mongolia can allow Japan to station troops after China and Japan sign an anti-Comintern agreement. If this is the case, after our country's troops withdraw from the occupied areas, what will be left? This is what I am very confused about. If you compare Wang Jingwei's statement with the Konoe Declaration, you can find that they are completely similar. In other words, both of them believe that in order for Japan to establish peace with the "new regime" in China, the first step is to withdraw troops from China, with the exception of North China and Inner Mongolia. That is, the land where the Japanese army has fought and suffered pain for two and a half years should be withdrawn. Is this the meaning of the Konoe Declaration? Does the Japanese government really intend to implement it? This is what I require the Prime Minister and the Ministers of the Army and Navy to explain."</p>
<h3 id="e38">What is the Meaning of the So-Called "New Order"? <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>Furthermore, regarding the handling of the China Incident and the establishment of a "new order" in East Asia, discussions have been frequently mentioned. Just yesterday alone, in the House of Representatives, numerous speakers mentioned "the new order in East Asia." However, at the beginning of the China Incident, this term was unknown. It was first used when former Prime Minister Konoe issued a statement on November 3, 1938. According to Foreign Minister Arita's statement to the House of Representatives yesterday, the term "new order" had already appeared in Europe several years ago. It is unclear whether the so-called establishment of a "new order" in Europe refers to poor countries demanding land from wealthy countries, which is a form of international communism. In reality, it seems to be the destruction and annexation of small countries by large countries in a struggle for survival, a violent act of destruction. As for our country, we have no interest in Europe and need not consider it. Then, what is the nature of establishing a new order in the Far East? According to the statements issued by Konoe and Wang Jingwei, the establishment of a "new order in East Asia" should be based on the following three principles: first, good neighborly relations; second, joint anti-communism; and third, economic cooperation. We have further questions: Is this definition approved by the government? Are the basic principles of the "new order in East Asia" limited to these three items? Are there other goals included? If there are other goals, we request the government to provide explanations. If the government is unable to disclose them, I dare not insist on this request. But in any case, the current war is wasting huge sums of money. It is aimed at establishing a "new order in East Asia," resulting in such great sacrifices. I sincerely hope that the government can frankly express its views on the so-called "new order in East Asia." Regarding this matter, the Special Committee of the Asia Development Board previously conducted research on the "new order in East Asia." The results were reported to the government by the board on December 11, 1939. I also have a copy of this report. The contents contain various terms that people like us who do not participate in politics cannot understand. (Applause from the members) This will be set aside for the moment. But since the "new order in East Asia" is the goal of this large-scale war and the various sacrifices it has caused, why did this term only appear after a year and a half of fighting? And why is it necessary for a special committee to study the basic principles or spiritual background of establishing a "new order" in East Asia? I do not understand all of this. I wonder if the government has anything to tell me? (Applause from the members) I also want to know why the Asia Development Board organized a special committee. It would be welcomed if the Prime Minister or the Director of the Asia Development Board could provide an explanation." (The official record of the assembly ends here. The following is likely deleted. The following is based on a report from the Japan Times.)</p>
<h3 id="e39">The Puppet Regime Lacks Strength, and Ideals are Difficult to Realize <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>Member Saito then reviewed world history, stating that in the past thirty-five centuries, the world has enjoyed true peace for only two hundred and fifty years. Most nations have struggled to maintain their existence. As for talking about peace without the backing of real power, it is no different from a cannon without bullets. Now, referring to world history and taking the struggles of various nations as a lesson, it is unknown whether the ideals set forth in the Konoe statement are truly feasible. According to the Japan Times, members of the Social Masses Party and other parties were greatly disturbed by these words. Some even said that Saito's speech slandered the actions of the Japanese army in China and should apologize. The atmosphere became noisy and chaotic, but Saito remained unmoved and continued to inquire, saying, "It is fortunate that a 'new regime' is about to be established in China, but according to what I have heard, these 'two new regimes' have no military. Generally speaking, an administrative organization without a military backing cannot have strong power. Then, whether this 'new regime' has the power necessary for survival is a question that we should consider. Also, after the establishment of the 'new regime,' the issue of Japanese recognition will arise accordingly. What is the government's view on this? As for the relationship between the 'new government' and the Chongqing National Government, I have heard that the 'new regime' has recently been in contact with the National Government. I believe that since the Chinese National Government's policy is anti-Japanese and pro-communist, the 'new government' should not contact it. I wonder what the government's view is on this point. I have heard that the land occupied by the Japanese army in China is equal to two and a half times the territory of Japan. I wonder if the Chinese 'new regime' can place such a large area of land under effective management? Please explain this as well. I believe that the Chinese 'new regime' should not have any contact with the Chongqing National Government in accordance with the policy of the Japanese government. In short, all the facts regarding the government's handling of the China Incident are what the Japanese people urgently want to know. If the government does not inform the public of the war's objectives, then the resolution of the China Incident will be meaningless. Since the outbreak of the incident, the government has changed more than once. Under these circumstances, how can the current difficulties be overcome? The people believe that the government will be able to resolve the China Incident satisfactorily, so they follow the government's orders in every move. If the government betrays the people's trust, it will lead to unfortunate results. The government should carefully consider the attitude of previous cabinets towards the people since the outbreak of the China Incident and provide a clear answer to my inquiries."

<p>Helsinki: Fighting continued unabated along the entire Finnish front over the weekend. In Karelia, Soviet artillery fire remained heavy. Soviet forces made some progress towards Viipuri. Both sides suffered heavy losses. The Finnish position between Summa and Lake Muolaanjärvi seemed to be under heavy pressure from Soviet forces. Further east, Soviet forces at Valkjärvi advanced along the railway. Soviet forces are now between Punnus and Poleikkala. It has been reported that the Finnish front line at Terppel has loosened slightly. The Finnish side stated that all Soviet attacks were repelled and that the enemy suffered heavy losses. There were no reports from the southern war zones such as Kummo and Salla today. Viipuri and Hanko were heavily bombed. Some bombs weighed up to 200 kilograms. The fire in Viipuri was quite serious. (Reuter's dispatch from the 11th)</p>
<p>Helsinki: The headquarters issued a war report today, stating that our troops won a great victory northwest of Lake Ladoga, killing 800 enemies, destroying 60 vehicles, and 2 tanks. Soviet Colonel Borisov, commander of the 11th Division, was killed in action. (Reuter's dispatch from the 11th)</p>
<p>Moscow: According to a communiqué from the headquarters of the Leningrad Military District, there were no major developments on the front line yesterday. The Soviet Air Force conducted reconnaissance flights and bombed enemy military targets. (TASS dispatch from the 11th)</p>
<p>Helsinki: The second battle of Karelia intensified further yesterday. Soviet forces launched attacks simultaneously at four important points, fully demonstrating that the Soviet high command has decided to break through the Mannerheim Line at any cost. According to the Finnish side, as of last night, Finnish forces were still firmly defending their positions and had not retreated an inch. (United Press dispatch from the 11th)</p>
<p>Helsinki: A communiqué issued here last night stated that Soviet forces were heavily damaged and retreated after attacking Karelia last night. Thirty tanks were destroyed. Soviet forces were defeated northeast of Lake Ladoga. Several rear areas of Finland were bombed by Soviet planes, killing one civilian. Four Soviet planes were shot down. (Reuter's dispatch from the 11th)</p>
<p>Stockholm: Yesterday, Soviet forces launched a fierce attack on the Mannerheim Line throughout the day. Soviet planes resumed bombing Finnish forces from early morning, and Soviet artillery also shelled simultaneously. Soon, Soviet forces launched an attack along the entire line. Finnish forces in Karelia were exhausted and could only try to hold on. However, Finnish forces north of Lake Ladoga seemed to be still on the offensive. (Reuter's dispatch from the 11th)</p>

<p>Rovaniemi: Snow has fallen on the northern Finnish front for the past two days. It is expected that this is a sign of a major storm in February, which may severely hinder Soviet activities in the area. Roads between the front line and the border are impassable. It is reported that Soviet supplies have been blocked halfway, and all transportation has been hindered. In addition, the Finns have another reason to welcome the snowfall, that is, to hope that Soviet bombing may be temporarily suspended as a result. (Reuter's dispatch from the 11th)</p>

<p>The Hague: The Norwegian representative to the League of Nations, Mr. Hambro, yesterday asked the League of Nations to provide relief to Finland quickly. According to Mr. Hambro, the number of Finnish refugees fleeing to Scandinavian countries is increasing daily, which is a serious problem. At the same time, the corpses of Soviet soldiers frozen to death on the Finnish battlefield will decompose and cause epidemics when the ice melts in the spring. At that time, diseases will spread to the Scandinavian countries. Furthermore, millions of brave Finns are currently being attacked by the Red Army, which is larger than the entire population of Finland. Therefore, they are in dire need of assistance. At the very least, we should immediately send 15,000 well-armed and well-trained soldiers to rescue them, which is only reasonable. The British and French representatives were very moved during Mr. Hambro's speech. (United Press dispatch from the 11th)</p>
<p>Montevideo: Uruguayan President General Baldomir yesterday consulted with Congress and suggested lending 100,000 pesos to help Finland, saying that the whole world does not want to see Finland sacrificed again.

<h3 id="e45">Current Situation of Export of Products from Southern Fujian, with Hong Kong as a Transit Market, but Reduced Compared to Before the War <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: The counties in southern Fujian are all coastal or near-coastal areas. Water and land transportation is mostly concentrated in Quanzhou and Zhangzhou. All import and export goods are shipped through Xiamen. After the fall of Xiamen, they were re-concentrated in Quanzhou and Zhangzhou for direct import and export. Except for Quanzhou Port, which is still open, Zhangzhou Port has not yet been opened and still relies on Gulangyu. Gulangyu is often disturbed by the Japanese, and the Chinese army's inspection along the coast is also very strict. Therefore, the import and export of goods is very inconvenient. Although Xiamen has fallen and become a dead island, the foreign shipping routes have not changed much and still dock at Xiamen and Gulangyu on schedule. Xiamen no longer has any commerce to speak of. As a result, Gulangyu, a residential area, has suddenly become a commercial port. However, almost all of Gulangyu's import and export goods are related to Zhangzhou. In other words, Gulangyu is only a storage and unloading place for Zhangzhou's concentrated import and export goods. Its commercial center is still in Zhangzhou. The export market for products from southern Fujian is divided into two aspects: domestic and foreign. Domestically, Fuzhou, Wenzhou, Ningbo, Shanghai, Tianjin, Shantou, and the three northeastern provinces are all important sales areas, especially Shanghai, which distributes goods to various cities and towns in the Yangtze River basin. In foreign countries, Southeast Asia is the most important, including the Philippines, Annam, Siam, and the British, Dutch, and Portuguese archipelagos. As far as Europe and the United States, and Japan and Taiwan before the war, are concerned, there are some, but not many. However, since the war, the domestic sales market has changed. Only Shanghai, Ningbo, Wenzhou, Fuzhou, and other places are still active. Last year, because all the important towns in the Yangtze River basin below Wuhan had fallen, the Shanghai sales market was relatively weak. The port of Wenzhou, however, has increased dramatically due to the opening of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. From Fuzhou through northern Fujian to the Jiangxi and Hunan area, it is also an inland trading station. However, recently not many goods have been transported to Fuzhou. The main foreign sales market is in Southeast Asia, but because Quanzhou and Zhangzhou merchants have limited capital and a narrow vision, there are very few who can engage in long-term operations. After the fall of Xiamen, it is even more lacking. Now most of the transactions are made in Hong Kong, and then re-shipped to Southeast Asia by Hong Kong merchants. Therefore, Hong Kong has become a transit market for the export of goods from the southern Fujian area. (Some overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia also directly purchase from Zhangzhou and Quanzhou, but not regularly.) As for Zhangzhou and Quanzhou merchants directly distributing goods to Southeast Asia, Singapore, Manila, Batavia, and other places are the most common. The main products of each county in southern Fujian are listed below:</p>
<p>(A) Common Products: (1) Rice: Longxi, Haicheng, Nanjing, Zhangpu, Pinghe, Changtai, Huaan, and other counties all produce rice. The annual export value is 3 million yuan, mostly sold to Jinjiang, Nan'an, and Huian. Dehua also exports a small amount, but only to Yongchun. (2) Sugar: Longxi, Haicheng, Nanjing, Pinghe, Changtai, Jinjiang, Nan'an, Tong'an, and other counties all produce sugar. The annual export value is 2.7 to 2.8 million yuan. (3) Salt: Huian, Jinjiang, Dongshan, Zhao'an, and other counties all have salt fields, which are transported and sold inland by the Salt Bureau itself. (4) Fish: Huian, Jinjiang, Dongshan, Zhao'an, and other counties all produce fish, with Huian being the largest. The total annual value of domestic and foreign sales is 400,000 to 500,000 yuan. (5) Bamboo and Wood: Anxi and Yongchun produce bamboo and wood, which can only be supplied to Quanzhou. Dehua produces bamboo and wood, which are transported to Fuzhou. There are no exports, only Zhangping and Nanjing, which are exported through Zhangzhou, with an annual value of more than 100,000 yuan. (6) Paper Foil: Originally a superstitious item, it used to be sold well in the three northeastern provinces and Southeast Asia. Both Quanzhou and Zhangzhou produce it. Last year, 800,000 yuan worth of paper foil was sold to Southeast Asia. In addition to the above, Zhangping, Anxi, and Dehua also produce paper, Huian produces peanuts, Zhangpu and Yunxiao produce peanut oil, Yunxiao produces charcoal, and Pinghe produces tobacco. Most of these are sold domestically.</p>
<p>(B) Special Products: 1. Usually larger exports: (1) Tea: Anxi produces Tieguanyin, Oolong, and other teas, about 7,000 dan, of which about 6,000 dan are exported annually. In the past, they were concentrated in Zhangzhou for export, but last year they were exported through Quanzhou. Nan'an and Yongchun export about 600 dan, all collected in Quanzhou. According to statistics, the total annual export value of Quanzhou is more than 500,000 yuan, which is transshipped to Southeast Asia through Shanghai and Hong Kong. (2) Citrus and Pomelos: Longxi, Changtai, Zhangpu, Nanjing, Haicheng, and other counties produce citrus and pomelos, which are concentrated in Zhangzhou for export. The annual value is more than 600,000 yuan, mostly sold to Shanghai, followed by Southeast Asia. (3) Dried Longan and Lychee: Longxi, Zhangpu, Nanjing, and Haicheng produce dried longan and lychee, which are concentrated in Zhangzhou for export. The annual value is more than 200,000 yuan. Jinjiang, Nan'an, and Tong'an produce dried longan and lychee, which are concentrated in Quanzhou for export. The annual value is more than 200,000 yuan, all transported to Shanghai, Wenzhou, and other places. There are no sales to Southeast Asia. (4) Porcelain: Dehua products are a special handicraft of this province, mostly sold in southern Fujian, western Fujian, and the Fuzhou area, with an annual value of more than 100,000 yuan. 2. Usually smaller exports: (1) Daffodils: Longxi produces daffodils, which are difficult to transplant, making them a unique specialty. The sales areas are Shanghai, Guangdong, and Southeast Asia, as well as Europe and the United States. The annual value is more than 80,000 yuan. Last year, due to the fall of Guangzhou and the lack of access to North China, only 30,000 to 40,000 yuan worth of daffodils were sold. (2) Bananas: Longxi and Nanjing produce bananas, especially the Tianbin bananas produced in Nanjing, which are famous. Most of the annual output is sold domestically. The export market is almost entirely occupied by Taiwan. (4) Kumquats: Yunxiao produces kumquats, which are mostly transported to Southeast Asia and often purchased by some overseas Chinese, but the number is not large, only more than 10,000 yuan per year. (6) Flower Rice: A by-product of tea, or used as a spice, Anxi, Longxi, Changtai, Nan'an, and other counties all produce it. It is mostly exported with tea, with an annual value of about 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. (6) Shenqu: A special product of Jinjiang, mostly sold to domestic and Southeast Asian Chinese medicine shops, with an annual value of 50,000 yuan. 3.

<h3 id="e46">The Puppet County Government of Kunshan Investigates the Household Registration in Each District <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>Kunshan Correspondence: The puppet county government is now following the instructions of the Japanese to order each district to investigate the household registration in order to issue county citizen certificates. The method is to register each item such as origin, name, age, gender, and occupation, and order each household to submit two photographic portraits of the whole family for use in pasting on the county citizen certificate and household registration book. It is said that this county citizen certificate obviously has the effect of restricting the residence of county citizens.</p>
<p>The Japanese ordered the puppet county government to instruct each district to search for and purchase military rice, limiting each district to 300 shi. The price of rice was initially set at 18 yuan, and then increased to 20 yuan. At first, no one responded. Then the village chiefs and bao chiefs were ordered to force farmers to supply as much as possible, and the required amount was obtained. However, after this search and purchase, the private reserves of the people were emptied, and problems will inevitably arise in terms of people's food in the future.</p>
<p>The Japanese prohibit the export of rice and eggs. Those who violate the ban will have their rice and eggs confiscated and be imprisoned in the bunkers (the Japanese have built bunkers next to the platforms of each station along the Beijing-Shanghai Railway) for a day and night before being released. Most of the personnel in the puppet organization are former political, police, and party members. There are also many educational figures. The current head of the Third Section, Mr. Hong, is a graduate of Jiangsu First Normal School. The head of the Youth League, Mr. Zhou, is a graduate of Chi-Tsih University. The district head of Qidun District, Mr. Li, is a graduate of Fudan University. There are too many others who hold puppet positions to list. There is also a type of person who secretly receives missions from the central government to engage in restoration work, while secretly colluding with the puppet organization, and even receiving subsidies from them, creating a situation of "cats and rats sleeping together." Most of these people are party members.</p>

Generally speaking, the teachers and students of various schools in Yunnan province can understand the ultimate intention of the state in establishing schools and education, and everywhere they show a good spirit of self-improvement, hard work, and perseverance, and the students are particularly diligent and hardworking in their studies, which is very gratifying. Although primary school education in Yunnan and Guizhou provinces has shown progress, the treatment of teachers and the training of teachers need to be improved and worked on. The relevant authorities in Yunnan and Guizhou are now paying close attention to this. As for secondary education, the quality of education in Yunnan province should be improved, while the quality and quantity of education in Guizhou province should be actively increased. In addition, the teaching tools for natural sciences in various schools are mostly incomplete and need to be added and supplemented. The library and equipment of each university are extremely lacking, and student management and military training also need to be improved.</p>

<h3 id="e53">The Final Act of Interport Football: Shanghai West United Wins Against the Hong Kong Team - Decisive Victory in the Last Quarter with a Score of 3-1 <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>The final act of the Shanghai-Hong Kong interport football match took place yesterday, with the Hong Kong team facing the Shanghai West United team. The match started at 10:30 AM at the Recreation Ground. The morning drizzle slightly affected the fans, but the number of spectators still reached three to four thousand, showing that Shanghai football fans are developing a higher level of appreciation for pure football skills, despite the fact that both teams were composed entirely of Westerners. As a result, the Hong Kong team suffered another defeat, losing 3-1. They were behind 1-0 in the first half and equalized in the second half, but then conceded two more goals in quick succession. The performances of both sides were brilliant, clean, and progressive. The lineups were as follows:</p>
<p>Shanghai West United</p>
<p>Su Shi</p>
<p>Kaimoer, Weiketai</p>
<p>Gelinbo, Jielai, Panjietuo</p>
<p>Kaluoliequ, Fulase, Kekelan, Kelasha, Paier</p>
<p>Hong Kong Team</p>
<p>Moshihan</p>
<p>Baoen, Haxian</p>
<p>Hannibolu, Gan, Maikewei</p>
<p>Shidulanqi, Dagao Shannu, Hexi, Hualu, Fokesi</p>
<p>First Half</p>
<p>The Tang Qiaosi orchestra once again performed on the field to provide entertainment, earning much praise from the audience. The Shanghai team's forwards were exceptionally sharp, and the defense was very solid. The Hong Kong team also launched attacks from time to time, but unfortunately, their shooting was poor, resulting in the loss of several good opportunities. Shanghai West United kicked off and immediately penetrated the Hong Kong formation, but was forced to retreat. Kaimoer kicked the ball out, and Paier also launched a diagonal shot. Fulase flew up and powerfully shot the ball into the net, giving the Shanghai team the lead. Only five minutes into the game, the Shanghai team continued to attack. Five minutes later, Kekelan charged into the penalty area, and Baoen's push was deemed a foul, resulting in a penalty kick. The Shanghai West United captain, Kaimoer, took the kick, but missed. Subsequently, both sides had dangerous moments, but none succeeded. Shanghai led 1-0 at the end of the first half.</p>
<p>Second Half</p>
<p>In the second half, the two sides remained in a stalemate for as long as twenty-five minutes, before the situation began to unfold. The Hong Kong team actively counterattacked. Little Shidulanqi flew down the left side. Weiketai lost his footing, and the ball fell to Dagao Shannu's feet. Dagao then passed it back to Little Shi, who shot it into the net, immediately leveling the score. Stimulated by this, the entire Shanghai team rose to the occasion. After ten minutes of fierce attacks, Kaluoliequ received a diagonal pass from Gelinbo and flew in from the left side, shooting towards the goal. Moshihan jumped up and parried the ball, but Kekelan headed it backwards, and Pan Jie, who was waiting behind, swept the ball in, giving Shanghai West United the lead again. Two minutes later, Kaluoliequ received a long shot from Fulase, charged in alone like a flying man, and scored again from fifteen yards out, resulting in a 3-1 victory. In total, the Hong Kong team suffered two defeats and one draw in Shanghai.</p>

After many days, it had not yet arrived. Dashin Company, the local agent for the vessel's operations, telegraphed to inquire, but received no reply. It was recently learned that the vessel telegraphed Shanghai on the 9th, reporting that it had run aground on a sandbar near Huanghuaguan, outside the port of Wenzhou, on the 6th due to inconvenient nighttime navigation after arriving outside the port of Wenzhou. Fortunately, it was in shallow waters, and there were no losses. It was successfully refloated the next day during high tide. The hull was undamaged, and the passengers and cargo were safe and sound.

<p>The fake "Central Market" has been in preparation for two months. Internally, it is divided into four departments: local goods, northern and southern goods, fresh eggs, pickled goods, and preserved meats. It has sent personnel to entice the relevant industries to join. It was originally scheduled to open on New Year's Day, but was postponed due to unfinished construction work. It is now learned that the local goods industry has refused to cooperate. It has held repeated meetings to discuss countermeasures and has decided to hold a general meeting within the next few days to discuss specific methods. It is said that the fake organization plans to be established on March 1st, while the branch "market" in Hongkou has already opened ahead of schedule.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Japanese Gambling Extravagantly - Japanese Consulate Police Mobilized - Over Two Hundred Arrested in Two Days <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Because of the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, nationals at home and abroad have suffered unprecedented difficulties, so the Japanese authorities have imposed strict restrictions on their nationals, especially on Japanese residents in Shanghai, strictly enforcing the rules. For example, all gambling dens in western Shanghai are strictly ordered to prevent their nationals from entering to engage in gambling. Those who comply outwardly but violate inwardly are severely punished. However, many Japanese residents still secretly enter and leave gambling dens, gambling as before, making it almost impossible for the Japanese authorities to deal with. Therefore, the Japanese authorities recently ordered the police department of the Japanese Consulate to strictly enforce the rules. The Japanese police department then mobilized all police officers on the 8th and 9th, distributing them on key roads on the north bank, such as Sichuan Road Bridge, to conduct strict checks and interrogations. At that time, Japanese residents who were returning from gambling were unaware of the situation and were stopped and interrogated. They had to present documents showing where they were going before being released. It was later learned that on the 8th and 9th, more than two hundred Japanese residents were reported for gambling and are being severely punished by the Japanese Consulate.</p>
<h3 id="e65">Border Road Construction Negotiations - Expected to Have Rapid Development - Expected Signature After Fan Keling Returns to Shanghai - Fei Lipu Noncommittal About Rumors <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>The Continental Daily reported that, according to well-informed sources yesterday (the 10th), Fei Lipu, Director General and President of the Shanghai Municipal Council, is now in Shanghai, and Fan Keling, Chairman of the Municipal Council, is also scheduled to return here from Dalian on Wednesday or Thursday. The negotiations between the Municipal Council and the "Shanghai Municipal Government" regarding the construction of roads beyond the border are therefore expected to have rapid development. On the investment side, rumors have been circulating for more than a month that the negotiations have reached the final stage, which was later confirmed by "Shanghai Mayor" Chuan Xiao'an. Until recently, it was also rumored that the two sides had reached an agreement on the policing of the roads built beyond the border. Although this statement has not yet been officially confirmed, it is indicated by those close to the Municipal Council that the only thing that has not been completed is the formal signing of the document that has already been prepared. According to reports, Fei Lipu recently went to Singapore for a short vacation. During this period, negotiations did not stop and Vice Director Ge Bo met with Mr. Fu to discuss various matters. These negotiations to temporarily resolve the issue of road construction beyond the border have been going on for more than a year and have suffered major setbacks but have not stopped. It was initially rumored that the document stipulating the organization of the "Outer Border Police Bureau" would be signed a week ago, but this plan was suspended due to Fan Keling's trip to Dalian. It is now heard that this document will be signed after Mr. Fan returns to Shanghai. The Shanghai Times also reported that recently, the local newspapers have reported news about the early resolution of the issue of road construction beyond the border, especially the policing of the roads built beyond the border. A reporter asked Fei Lipu about this news yesterday. He replied that he could not tell him anything at the moment and that he did not want to confirm or deny the rumors. According to reports, the two sides have reached an agreement, everything is ready, and Chuan Xiao'an and representatives of the Municipal Council are preparing to sign the agreement, and a joint policing system will be established in the area of ​​the roads outside the boundary in western Shanghai. Regarding this point, Mr. Fei said, "It's too early to say."</p>

<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Government telegraphed the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday regarding the verification and release of products from Shenxin and Wing On Yarn Factories, saying, "Your telegram is noted.

Orders have been telegraphed for compliance. The incident mentioned in your telegram that products from Factory No. 3 of Wing On are still being detained may be due to a misunderstanding caused by the Chamber of Commerce not providing certification. In the future, the procedures stipulated by the Ministry must be followed for verification and release. Please be informed." Huang Shao-hong, Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, [seal]. It is also learned that the Jiangxi Provincial Industrial and Commercial Management Office also telegraphed the City Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating that they will verify and release the products from the three factories upon presentation of the certificate of certification.</p>
<h3 id="e68">Public Works Department, Shanghai Municipal Council: Volunteer Corps Annual Report, 1939 <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Section One (1) Overview</p>
<p>Local Conditions</p>
<p>The local situation this year was largely the same as the previous year. The defense area south of the Suzhou Creek was still garrisoned by regular foreign troops. The Volunteer Corps, on the one hand, maintained internal security, and on the other hand, served as a reserve force for the foreign troops. The use of the Hongkew Rifle Range was still restricted. All officers and men on duty were required to travel to or from the range in specially prepared Volunteer Corps transport vehicles, and were not allowed to stay overnight at the range. Members of the Chinese Company were not allowed to go at all. As a result, the Volunteer Corps' permanent barracks could not be fully utilized, and the training of the members was hampered. Within the defense area, the most noteworthy situation was the deteriorating security in the Western District. The security of this area was jointly maintained by the police and the foreign troops stationed in the "D" area, but the Volunteer Corps was also affected. This was partly because the Volunteer Corps members were ordered to mobilize during certain periods, and partly because all of the corps' armored vehicles had been transferred to the police for use. The armored vehicles were transferred on July 25 of last year, and there is no hope of their return in the near future. The Volunteer Corps' armored car unit has long been recognized as the most elite and capable unit, and the transfer of the vehicles has inevitably diminished the Volunteer Corps' strength. Moreover, frequent use of armored vehicles leads to easy wear and tear. (On January 26 of this year, after this report was drafted, all but two of the armored vehicles had been returned to the Volunteer Corps by the police.)</p>
<p>Anniversaries</p>
<p>In the past, whenever there were local anniversaries, a tense atmosphere would arise within the Settlement. The same was true last year. However, the Volunteer Corps, the police, and the foreign troops were able to cooperate thoroughly and be jointly prepared. All arrangements were very effective. The increasing number of local anniversaries has created a serious problem for the Volunteer Corps. Most of the members have jobs and cannot immediately leave their work to respond to mobilization. In order to solve this difficulty, the Volunteer Corps headquarters has established a special procedure: whenever it is necessary to dispatch members for patrols, the headquarters only summons the required number of people, orders each member to perform duty for several hours, and then allows them to return to their original positions. This procedure inevitably increases the responsibility of commanders at all levels. Fortunately, since its implementation, the results have been good. This is due to the efforts of all concerned personnel, which is highly commendable. The effectiveness of the Volunteer Corps' service has been maximized, while the impact on the members' own careers has been minimized.</p>
<p>Summer Training</p>
<p>In previous years, the Volunteer Corps routinely underwent training from May to October 1, with few holidays. This was because the increasing number of local anniversaries and the changing international situation made it necessary to strive for the Volunteer Corps' strength to be as elite as possible. The training subjects last year were more numerous than usual. The members enthusiastically participated in the training, which was very satisfactory. Not a few members competed to participate, but were left out due to the limited number of places. The foreign troops stationed in Shanghai often sent personnel to the Volunteer Corps to participate in training. The Volunteer Corps expresses its deep gratitude to the commander of the British forces in Shanghai and the commander of the Fourth Regiment of the United States Marine Corps. In addition, when the Volunteer Corps used the streets for training, the Commissioner of Police of the Public Works Department often ordered appropriate arrangements to be made, and should also be thanked.</p>
<p>(2) Service from December 1 of the previous year to September 30 of last year, and the Double Tenth Festival service of last year.</p>
<p>Training Overview</p>
<p>Most of the training subjects for the previous year had been completed before December of the previous year. The members' performance showed obvious improvement. The methods of stacking sandbags and erecting barbed wire fences have been taught separately to each company. The use of the Hongkew Rifle Range was still restricted. The usual night shooting was temporarily suspended last year. All members had to travel to and from the range in Volunteer Corps transport vehicles. However, the excellent shooting results were satisfactory. The rifle competition could not be held due to various restrictions and the rising price of military equipment. However, a competition was held to encourage members to use the range at least once during the summer. In December of the previous year, the Volunteer Corps participated in the overseas competition organized by the British Rifle Association, and achieved second place, winning nine medals. Although the Volunteer Corps' permanent barracks could not be used, the annual weekend camping activities of each company were held, with day and night work carried out separately at the rifle range and the headquarters parade ground.</p>
<p>Anniversaries</p>
<p>Last year, the number of times that Volunteer Corps members jointly maintained security with the police and foreign troops in the International Settlement and the Western District was less than in previous years. In the past, the Volunteer Corps was often ordered to mobilize when there was a risk of an incident. This practice has been changed, partly because the number of mobilizations in previous years was too high, partly because mobilization was very uneconomical, and partly because the members' own affairs were so numerous that it was inconvenient to leave their work unless absolutely necessary. During the year, the Volunteer Corps assisted the police on a total of eighty-four days, including eighteen days when volunteers were also called up for duty. The number of days that the Russian Company was stationed on the Bund and the number of times that the Transport Company assisted the police in performing special duties were not included in the calculation. The service performance of the Russian Company always maintained its highest level. Around the August 13th anniversary, the Volunteer Corps was ordered to be on alert. At 5:00 AM on August 9th, the Volunteer Corps took precautionary measures. From that time until 5:00 AM on August 12th, a considerable number of patrol and guard members were dispatched. At 5:00 AM on August 12th, the Volunteer Corps mobilized, and at 8:00 AM on August 14th, precautionary measures were resumed. At 8:00 PM that afternoon, the alert was lifted. The measures taken during the mobilization period were as follows: (1) armored car patrol in the Central District and west of Yu Qiaqing Road (one vehicle each); (2) military vehicle patrol in the Central District (two vehicles); (3) foot patrol in the Central District (five teams); (4) stationing guards; (5) protecting ten newspapers in the Central District; (6) patrol in the (C) defense area with the assistance of the US military; (7) guarding the headquarters. The performance of all of the above duties was excellent. In addition, the Transport Company also performed a number of duties. The armored vehicles were transferred to the police on July 15. After that, except for one time in August, they were managed by the police. Drivers were dispatched from the Russian Company, but the number was limited and insufficient. The Transport Company assisted in dispatching additional personnel. Section Two (1) Overview of service from October 1 to November 30 of last year.</p>
<p>General Remarks</p>
<p>The annual training year begins on October 1. According to past practice, most of the training courses are concentrated in the first half of the year, so that officers and non-commissioned officers can review old lessons and pass on the knowledge they have gained to the members under their command. As for the content of the courses, in previous years they usually included weapons training, sand table technique lectures, drill and administrative training, etc. However, last year, because the Public Works Department had ordered all members to receive thorough training in dispersing rioters and street fighting tactics, the content of the training courses was revised accordingly. Weapons training, except for bayonet combat, was temporarily suspended, but each company was required to review it on its own. A special weapons training class for senior instructors of each company was held in June and July, which proved to be of great value. The Volunteer Corps headquarters also held two cadre training classes for the instructors of each company. All trainees agreed not to be absent during the training period. Class time was from 1:45 PM to 8:00 PM on Saturdays, and from 6:45 AM to 7:00 PM on Sundays, with short breaks for meals and rest in between. An examination was held at the end of each class, and the results were very good. The headquarters also stipulated that each company should hold a cadre training class separately, and all members were required to participate. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e69">Shanghai Municipal Federation Letter to the Authorities of the Two Settlements Requesting Control of Coal Prices: Fuel and Grain are Necessities for People's Livelihood, Only Through Control Can Threats be Removed; Coal Prices Rise Endlessly, Many Hot Water Shops Close Down. <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>The high price of coal in Shanghai has affected people's livelihood. The First Special District Citizens' Federation has sent letters to the Public Works Department of the Shanghai International Settlement and the Municipal Council of the French Concession, requesting that they carry out coal stock investigations, strictly set price limits, and prevent hoarding and manipulation in order to stabilize coal prices and secure people's livelihood. The original letter states: The prices of goods in Shanghai are soaring, and people's livelihood is difficult, especially the price of coal. Before the war, each ton sold for more than ten yuan, but now it has reached one hundred and sixty to seventy yuan. Coal is a necessity for people's daily use, and also the driving force for various industries. Since the price of coal has risen, it has been followed by price increases by the water company, the electricity company, hotels, restaurants, bathhouses, and "tiger stoves," all of which are closely related to people's livelihood. Due to the rising price of coal, many factories have been forced to reduce their work, and those who barely maintain the status quo have high costs and will inevitably seek compensation from general consumers, thus stimulating and evolving into the current state of expensive goods. The Federation, witnessing the difficulties of the times, believes that stabilizing coal prices is as important as stabilizing rice prices for the current stabilization of people's livelihood, and therefore sends this letter, requesting your Board to follow the measures for controlling rice prices, strictly set the maximum selling price of coal, and order all coal firms to comply. At the same time, investigate coal stocks, strictly investigate hoarding and manipulation, and hope to find ways to dredge the source. It concerns the public livelihood, social stability, and the elimination of threats. Sincerely request implementation.</p>
<h3 id="e70">The Situation in Eastern Zhejiang is Gradually Stabilizing: Transportation Between Shanghai and Ningbo is Unobstructed; Japanese Troops in Xiepu are Annihilated; Fenghua Xikou Bombed Again. <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>After the Japanese troops crossed the Qiantang River and invaded Xiaoshao, and after China dispatched a large army to block them, the landed Japanese troops were already unable to support themselves. They retreated to the west of Xiaoshan riverside and are about to be completely wiped out. Heavy troops have long been stationed along the coast of eastern Zhejiang, strictly guarded and ready to wait. On the 9th, Japanese warships outside Zhenhai Port attempted to land in Xiepu by stealth, but after being severely attacked by the garrison, they were immediately annihilated and a Japanese boat was sunk. However, the Japanese warships outside Zhenhai Port have not retreated, and Japanese warships patrol the ocean surface from time to time. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned yesterday from the shipping industry that Xiepu is a small coastal town belonging to Zhenhai, very close to Longshan. The Ningci-Zhen Highway has a branch road to Xiepu, which was completely destroyed long ago after the war. In the past, there was a Xiepu branch of the Zhejiang Customs. Yesterday, foreign ships anchored outside Zhenhai Port reported their itineraries to Shanghai, and did not mention the Xiepu incident, which proves that the Japanese army's landing in Xiepu has been resolved. The German ship "Deping" of the Italian firm Sino-Italian Company left Zhenhai yesterday at 4 PM and is expected to arrive in Shanghai at 8 AM this morning. It is also heard that there was an air raid alert in Ningbo yesterday and artillery fire at Zhaobao Mountain outside Zhenhai Port, but the local area is still peaceful as usual.</p>
<p>Remnants of Japanese Troops Retreat North from Xiaoshan</p>
<p>After the Japanese troops who crossed the Qiantang River intruded into Yiqiao, Wenjia Yan, Qianqing Town and other places, they were successively defeated by the Chinese army, and were forced to remain in Xiaoshan County and the riverbank, forming turtles in a jar. At 2 PM on the 9th, the Chinese army once again rushed into the city, launching fierce street battles. Many Japanese soldiers were annihilated and they could not support themselves, and withdrew from the county seat. A portion retreated to the river bank to board boats and retreat across the river. That night, because Xiaoshan County had become a rubble empty field and had no value, the Chinese army automatically gave up again, and closely surrounded the county on different sides.</p>
<p>Forty-Eight Shells Hit Xikou</p>
<p>According to a reporter from the Datong News Agency who inquired from the Ningbo community in Shanghai, at 1 PM on the 10th, nine Japanese planes flew to Fenghua Xikou town again to bomb, dropping forty-eight shells, killing and wounding more than a dozen farmers, women and children. A portion of the Jinxi United Transport Company's bus station was destroyed. The remaining shells fell in the residential area of the town. Xikou is the hometown of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, and this is the second time it has been bombed.</p>
<p>Parcel Post Service Along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Temporarily Suspended</p>
<p>Since Xiaoshan in eastern Zhejiang fell into the war zone, the local situation in Shaoxing, Jinhua, Ningbo, and other counties has become tense. The highways and the Xiaoshan-Zhuji section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway have been destroyed one by one according to the pre-set plan. Moreover, local military transportation is busy, and it is difficult to deliver light mail to various places in eastern Zhejiang. However, the Transportation Section of the Shanghai Postal Administration is doing its best to dredge the channels. Express letters, registered letters, and postcards to various cities and counties in eastern Zhejiang, such as Shaoxing, Zhuji, Jinhua, Yuyao, Shangyu, Xinchang, Shengxian, Dongyang, Yiwu, Ningbo, Wenzhou, Yongkang, etc., are still delivered as usual. However, remittance services are temporarily suspended only in Zhuji, Shaoxing, Xiaoshan, Linpu, Baiguan and other places. In other places, drafts are still issued according to the original amount. Large commodity packages have been suspended due to transportation difficulties. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned yesterday from the Parcel Post Business Section of the Shanghai Postal Administration that small parcel mail to Shaoxing and its surroundings, as well as along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, will also be temporarily suspended from today. It is reported that postal service to Ningbo, Yongjia (Wenzhou) and other places along the coast is still normal.</p>
<p>Foreign Ships Resume Sailing, Schedules Set</p>
<p>Shipping companies in Shanghai have been closed for four days since the Lunar New Year. Shipping on the Shanghai-Wenzhou and Shanghai-Ningbo lines has been scheduled to resume today. However, due to the closure of various businesses, all passengers and cargo must wait until after the reopening before they can be loaded. Therefore, the sailing dates are all after the 13th. British shipping companies Jardine Matheson and Butterfield &amp; Swire have also temporarily suspended all shipping lines for five days since the 8th due to the closure of the shipworkers and dockworkers. They are scheduled to resume normal sailing on the 14th. However, during the New Year period, there are not many merchants buying goods, and cargo transportation will not be congested for the time being.</p>

<p>Chi Along, a Ningbo native working as a sailor on a Japanese Mitsubishi ship, drank too much on the 6th of this month and wandered around the entrance of Lane 291 on Wuchang Road. The lane was full of brothels, and he was dragged into the lane by a group of Jiangbei ruffians who specialized in attracting customers. They took advantage of the opportunity to steal 23.80 yuan in legal tender from Chi Along and fled in all directions. It was reported to the Hongkew police, who arrested Yin Kezhi, a Jiangbei native involved in the case. On the morning of the 7th, he was sent to the First Special Court. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu explained the details and questioned the defendant, who denied the charges. Lawyer Jiang Chiping was retained to defend him. The victim, Chi Along, did not appear, and Liu Yugui announced a verdict of not guilty and released him.</p>

<p>Lu Yili, a Changzhou native, 37 years old, worked as a runner for the Huacheng Coal Firm at No. 33 Sichuan Road. On March 4 of last year, Lu falsely claimed to Wu Tiemei, the owner of the firm, that the Great China Rubber Factory needed to purchase 500 tons of Hongji coal dust, but because the firm was short of stock, it needed to be purchased from the Yuanxiang Coal Firm at No. 106 Ganshi East Road, which could yield a high profit. Wu believed him and the next day ordered Lu to accompany clerk Weng Shaoyou to bring 6,680 yuan in cash to the Yuanxiang Coal Firm to contact runner Chen Kangyuan. At that time, they settled the deal and obtained a Tongchang Coal Firm No. 3 mine Hongji coal dust warehouse receipt for 300 tons. On the 7th of the same month, Wu sent a partner to hire a boat to Pudong to pick up the goods from the No. 3 mine, only to find that the receipt was a forgery. Knowing that he had been swindled by Lu, he reported to the police, but Lu had already fled upon hearing the news. Only Chen Kangyuan was arrested and sent to the criminal court of the Second Special Court. The trial concluded with a verdict of not guilty. The Third High Court of Appeal held that Chen was suspected of forging the warehouse receipt and sentenced him to six months imprisonment, suspended for three years. Lu Yili, seeing that the matter had passed, was active in society again and was discovered by Wu, who reported it to the police and arrested him. Based on Lu's confession, his brother Lu Shouxiang was also arrested and brought to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special Court for interrogation. Judge Qiu has now concluded the trial and ruled that "Lu Yili is sentenced to one year and six months imprisonment for continuous embezzlement of items held in the course of business; Lu Shouxiang is fined 500 yuan for receiving stolen goods; both defendants shall compensate the plaintiff 6,680 yuan in national currency."</p>

<p>Zhang Jingxian, a Huangdu native, 37 years old, lived at No. 13 Shantou Road and worked as a broker for the Yisheng Sugar Firm opened by Shen Yansheng of Jiaxing at No. 59 the Bund, No. 16 wharf. In December of last year, because he lost a large sum of money in a gambling den in western Shanghai, he devised a plan to swindle 200-300 bags of red and white sugar worth 9,563.50 yuan from the firm and issued checks from Kenye and Huizhong banks under the names of Tianyuan, Xiyuan, and Laoda Fang sugar and food stores. When Shen sent someone to collect the money, they were all returned, and he realized that he had been swindled. Zhang was subsequently spotted by Shen on the road, who reported it to the police and arrested him. He was sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special Court for interrogation. Judge Qiu has now concluded the trial and ruled that "Zhang Jingxian is sentenced to one year and six months imprisonment for continuous embezzlement of items held in the course of business, and shall compensate the plaintiff 9,563.50 yuan in national currency."</p>

A few days ago, she had an argument with her mother, Xu Qian, over a trivial matter, and developed a desire to end her life. On the morning of the previous day, she secretly mixed medicine and chilblain medicine at home and swallowed it to commit suicide. At noon, her mother discovered it and sent her to Guangci Hospital, but she had been poisoned too deeply and died before she could be saved.</p>

<p>The New Voice News Agency reported that the tenants of Lianxi Fang on Guangxi Road, including the Jili Laundry Company, jointly sent a letter to the First Special District Citizens' Federation, stating: "Since the Shanghai war, prices have skyrocketed, and food prices have soared, which is unprecedented. The livelihood of citizens is in imminent danger, which is self-evident. Those who live on the isolated island are all eagerly hoping that various public organizations will make every effort to suppress prices, so that citizens who are sitting on pins and needles can be relieved. Just as we were waiting for assistance, we suddenly received a letter from the landlord stating that the rents for the shops along the road and the residential houses in Lianxi Fang on Guangxi Road would be increased by 30%, 50%, and 60%, and that if we did not agree to the rent increase, we would have to return the empty houses. Such blatant threats are completely unreasonable. In the current situation, we tenants are in a fiery pit and cannot bear any further burden. Therefore, we have unanimously decided to send a letter to the rental agency to request that they withdraw their decision, but we have not received a reply. We suspect that there is a hidden agenda. We are therefore writing to you to complain and ask for your guidance and assistance. We are anxiously awaiting your instructions."</p>
<p>The Daguang News Agency reported that the Zhonghui Bank Building on Aiguo Road in the French Concession has hundreds of rooms, which are rented as offices and residences. The current rent has already increased compared to before the war. Recently, the bank's rental department has proposed a further rent increase, by as much as 30%. Therefore, all the tenants have unanimously expressed their opposition. After a meeting, they decided to ask the French Concession Taxpayers' Association (which is also a tenant of the building on the second floor) for assistance, and have scheduled to register from today in order to negotiate with the bank authorities to reduce the rent increase and ease the burden.</p>

<p>Wang Dabaozi, a Jiangbei native, in his thirties, and his wife, Cai, built a thatched hut on the eastern section of Meixie Road on South Railway Station Road and raised pigs. Last year, they raised more than ten pigs and sold them for more than 700 yuan in cash at the end of the old year, which attracted the attention of local hooligans. On the eve of the old Lunar New Year last year, at about 8 PM, more than ten robbers suddenly arrived, each holding a pistol and a box gun. They tied up Wang and his wife separately with ropes and searched the premises, only finding more than 130 yuan in cash. The robbers were still not satisfied and hung Wang and his wife up with ropes. They first beat them with gun butts and wooden sticks, and then burned Wang's ribs and Wang's wife's lower body with candles, forcing them to reveal where they had hidden the silver. Wang's wife had no choice but to reveal the 300 yuan in cash hidden in an iron box in the soil under the bed. After the robbers found it, they put Wang and his wife down, took the loot, and left. Wang and his wife were covered in injuries and are still bedridden.</p>

But yesterday at 8:45 AM, three robbers suddenly came in and rummaged through boxes and cabinets, searching arbitrarily. Zhu was still fast asleep and woke up with a start. He had a slight argument with the robbers and was shot in the right leg by the robbers and fell on the bed. The robbers then calmly fled. His family later transported him to Guangci Hospital for treatment.</p>

Here: Cloudy, turning foggy, with northeasterly to northwesterly winds. South of Ma'an'an Island: Rain or fog, with northeasterly winds. South China: Mostly sunny. Also, in the 24 hours before 3:00 PM yesterday, the highest temperature in this city was 54.3, the lowest 44.6. On the same day of this year, the highest was 49.6, the lowest 41.9.</p>
<h3 id="e82">Cost of Living Index in This City Hits New High Last Month; Purchasing Power of Currency Greatly Reduced; One Legal Tender Dollar Worth Only Slightly More Than 30 Cents <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Various sectors are concerned about the livelihoods of the poor, hence the organization of a Fair Price Rice Committee, which will begin fair price rice sales on the 21st of this month.  Saigon broken rice is ordered and sold at six and a half catties per dollar, equivalent to twenty-four dollars per stone.  Each person is limited to one dollar's worth per purchase.  The Salvation Army has also started providing hot meals, using paper bags to hold half a pound of rice to help starving beggars on the streets.</p>
<p>Among various prices, vegetables have risen the most sharply.  The price of green vegetables has increased by 103.28% compared to last month.  Spinach has increased by 64%, and sprouted beans and radishes have also increased by more than 45% each.  Fish and meat have also generally become more expensive.  Fresh pork has increased by 7%, and fresh fish has increased by 26%.  Soybean oil and lard have each fallen by about 10% compared to last month, which is a reaction to the sharp rise last month.</p>
<p>In January of this year, the semi-annual rent survey was conducted as usual.  Within half a year, rents continued to increase.  The average increase for shikumen buildings was 6.91% compared to the second half of last year.  Western-style buildings increased by 9.64%, and bungalows increased by 6.31%.  The average total increase was 7.94%.  More than half of the increases were for water fees.</p>
<p>The prices of all kinds of clothing have increased, ranging from 6% to 11%.  The increase in dyeing fees and expensive raw materials are the main reasons.  The price of coal and coal dust has soared due to the surge in transportation costs and the strong demand in winter.  At the end of the month, coal balls reached a high price of five dollars per dan, which is a far cry from the pre-war price of one dollar and ten cents per dan.  Among miscellaneous items, tea has risen the most sharply, increasing by 68.42% compared to last month.</p>

<p>In Die Village, Yuyuan Road, Shanghai West, at number 20, live two Zhu sisters who work as dancers in a certain dance hall. Yesterday at around 6:00 PM, the two sisters, accompanied by their boyfriend (a certain nouveau riche), took their own car, number 3414, and left home. When the car drove to the entrance of the lane, Wang Shouye and Wang Maoxia, residents of number 24 in the same lane, were seeing off a friend in a rickshaw. Somehow, the car and the rickshaw collided, and the two sides had an argument. At that time, the dancer's boyfriend got out of the car and ran out of the lane. After a while, he returned with six fake policemen, who, without asking the reason, kidnapped Wang Shouye and Wang Maoxia. In the midst of the chaos, the concierge at number 1121 of the lane saw the situation and was greatly shocked. He immediately telephoned the Jing'an Temple Road police station. Upon receiving the report, the police chief immediately sent detectives to investigate. By the time the detectives arrived, the fake policemen had dispersed and the two Wangs had been taken away. The police station is currently investigating the details.</p>

<p>Shen Chang Department Store at 55 Avenue Dubail is owned by Sun Qilong (45 years old this year) from Yangzhou. He sublets the remaining rooms upstairs as a second landlord. Sun Chenggui, the owner of Gong Xin Department Store at 605 Wenlu, had his wife renting rooms from Sun Qilong's department store upstairs. Shen Chang store owner Sun Qilong, seeing that Sun Chenggui's wife, Ms. Gu, had a beautiful appearance, secretly seduced her and began a relationship without the knowledge of Mr. Sun Chenggui. Recently, while Sun Qilong was managing affairs in the store after dinner on the 4th of last month, he was suddenly attacked by thugs who splashed nitric acid, causing injuries to Sun Qilong's head, face, and left eye. The assailants fled the scene. After being injured, Sun Qilong reported the incident to the French police station and was sent to Guangxiang Hospital for treatment. The police station began investigating the perpetrators. After Sun Qilong was discharged from the hospital, he hired lawyer Peng Qixiu to file a lawsuit in the Criminal Court of the Special Second Court, accusing Sun Chenggui of instigating the assault. He also admitted to having a relationship with Sun Chenggui's wife, Ms. Gu. Over time, Sun Chenggui learned of the affair and threatened revenge, which has now come to fruition. He requested that the court investigate according to Article 178 of the Criminal Law. Judge Miao Qingbang opened a trial on the case. The defendant Sun Chenggui and his defense lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Enliang appeared in court, denying instigating the assault. During the time when the plaintiff was injured, the defendant was transporting his concubine's coffin back to his hometown and was not in Shanghai. The court ordered the police station's files to be investigated and adjourned the hearing. Subsequently, Sun Chenggui, through his lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Enliang, filed a lawsuit in the Criminal Court of the Special Second Court, accusing Sun Qilong of interference with his family, requesting that the court investigate according to the law. Judge Jiang Quan opened a trial on the case the morning before yesterday. Both parties appeared in court with their lawyers. After the court questioned both parties in detail, the court ruled that the case required a detailed investigation and adjourned the hearing.</p>

<p>Qu Shusheng, a local resident, 34 years old this year, lives at 272 Rue Sainte Marie, Avenue du Roi Albert, and runs the Qu Shengxing Cotton Shop. In 1927, he met Yu Taohua (22 years old this year, from Ningbo), a female hostess at the Great World amusement park, and soon rented a house to live together. They have a daughter. Recently, they had disagreements, and the woman hired a lawyer to file a petition in the Civil Court of the Special Second Court, requesting mediation, seeking to terminate the cohabitation relationship with Qu, and demanding 50 yuan per month for living expenses. After mediation by the court, the two parties reached a settlement and reconciled. However, Qu discovered that the woman's hiring of a lawyer was instigated by Lin Xu, the wife of his neighbor Lin Genfa, who colluded with the woman. Qu then reported the woman to the police for running away and accused Lin Xu of inciting theft. Both were arrested by detectives and sent to the Criminal Court 8 of the Special Second Court for trial. After trial, Judge Zhu Chuzhe ruled that Yu Taohua was guilty of theft and Lin Xu was guilty of inciting theft, each sentenced to four months in prison, suspended for three years.</p>

<p>The robbers Cao Youfa from Ningbo and Yu Quhai from Tongzhou, at around 9:00 PM on January 30th, with their accomplices Jiang Asan and Shen Atao, who are still at large, each armed with fake pistols and knives, broke into the Yu Shunfeng tobacco and paper shop at 1783 Yangshupu Road, intending to rob the property. Cao Youfa pulled out a knife and dragged the shop owner, Yu Agao from Ningbo, into a small room behind the shop, threatening him to make a sound. At that time, Yu's wife, Ms. Wang, was quite alert and climbed to the roof, shouting for robbers and sounding the alarm. Jiang, Shen, and Yu, seeing that things were not going well, scattered and fled. Cao, inside, was unaware and was captured by the shop owner, Yu Agao. Subsequently, Chinese Detective Liu Changgen of the Yangshupu police station arrived after hearing the alarm and took Cao to the police station. He learned that his accomplice Yu Quhai was hiding at 4 Tangshan Road. He went to arrest him and arrested Cao. In the morning of July, they were sent to the Criminal Court 3 of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu gave a detailed account of the case, requesting an extension of the detention of the accomplices. Then the tobacco and paper shop owner Yu Agao testified about the incident. Judge Huang Risheng questioned the two thieves Cao and Yu briefly and ordered them to be sent back for trial and further verification. Also, the robbers Zhang Ajin, a local, and Huang Hanyang, from Tongzhou, at 6:00 PM on January 31st, joined with two others who are still at large to rob the property of the Li Da Cloth Shop at 17 Lloyd Road, worth 880 yuan. The case was discovered, and they were arrested and sent to the First Special District Court for trial and detention. On the morning of the 7th, Judge Liu Yugui of the Criminal Court 3 conducted a trial. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu stated that the two accomplices who were at large could not be arrested. Judge Liu, after clarifying the facts, sentenced Zhang Ajin and Huang Hanyang each to five years in prison as a warning.</p>

<h3 id="e89">Preliminary Discussion on the Public Treasury Regulations <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>— Xia Gaobo</p>
<p>Scholars have often said that the organization and facilities of our country's financial administration are quite unique: that is, the joint comprehensive organization of the four powers. Joint comprehensive organization, abbreviated as joint organization, except for a very small number of scholars (such as Mr. Hu Shanheng) who have offered comments and criticisms, is generally regarded as a good structure for our country's financial administration. Its essence lies in the transcendence of rights and responsibilities, hoping to achieve the effect of division of labor and cooperation. This type of organization is based on the structure of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Five-Power Constitution, so it cannot be effectively copied by other countries with the separation of three powers or a cabinet system. The effectiveness of the joint organization is based on the establishment and soundness of the four major systems. The four major systems refer to the administrative system (i.e., the command system), the cashier system (i.e., the public treasury system), the accounting system (as active auditing), and the auditing system (as passive auditing). In the past, from the perspective of laws and regulations, various organizational laws of accounting organs (specifically referring to the four aspects of administration, accounting, cashier, and auditing) have been promulgated and clearly ordered to be implemented; various procedural laws (such as the Budget Law, the Accounting Law, the Audit Law, and the Settlement Law, etc.) have also been promulgated and implemented one after another. However, although the Public Treasury Law (promulgated on June 9, 1938) and its implementation rules (promulgated by the Executive Yuan on June 27, 1939) have been promulgated one after another, they have not been implemented due to insufficient political conditions. Recently, considering that at the time of resistance and national construction, the unification of national income and expenditure is urgently needed, so that public funds can be returned to the public and strengthen national financial strength, and a clear political situation can also be realized, the National Government issued an order on June 24, 1939, that the Public Treasury Law will be gradually implemented in stages and regions from October 1st. Thus, the four major systems under the joint organization, which is admired by the world, are all established, and the time for vigorous governance has arrived. Therefore, the implementation of the Public Treasury Law has great significance in the history of our country's finance and cannot be taken lightly.</p>
<p>The author once drafted an article "The Public Treasury Law About to Be Implemented" (see Volume 23, Issue 29 of the Banking Weekly), making a brief introduction to the Public Treasury Law before its implementation, attaching my own views and placing unlimited hope in the future. Now I will study the provisions again and offer a preliminary discussion, but I am afraid that my opinions are not as good as those of ordinary people.</p>
<p>1. Regulations on Public Treasury Deposit Contracts Considering that our country's public treasury system adopts the "bank deposit system," Article 8 of the Public Treasury Law (hereinafter referred to as "this law") states: "The cash and matured bills and securities received by the bank as an agent shall be deposited in the form of deposits..." Then, the agent bank or postal institution has the right to use and the obligation to pay interest on the deposited public funds. The rights and obligations between the two parties (the public treasury competent authority and the agent bank) shall be determined by contract in accordance with the law and approved by the superior authority of the public treasury competent authority (according to the note, the superior authority of the national treasury competent authority is the Executive Yuan; the superior authority of the provincial treasury and the municipal treasury directly under the Executive Yuan is the Ministry of Finance; the superior authority of the county and municipal treasury competent authority is the provincial finance department) (see Article 8 and Article 2, paragraph 2 of this law, and Article 17 of the implementation rules).</p>
<p>The contents or necessary items of the contract are not thoroughly regulated in this law and its implementation rules, and it is vaguely stated that "except for specific restrictions by laws and regulations, it shall be determined by contract..." I believe that this provision is too general and lacks thoroughness. It is true that the relationship between the rights and obligations of the two parties varies due to different circumstances. If it is clearly stipulated by law, it will be obstructive and inappropriate. However, some basic relationships and matters can also be generally regulated, so that the agent bank and the public treasury competent authority have something to follow when signing a contract, and the necessary items will not be omitted. Otherwise, once signed and approved by the superior authority, it will be troublesome to amend it if it becomes inconvenient. In order to speed up the time and facilitate the smooth implementation, the implementation rules of the Public Treasury Law should have appropriate regulations on this matter.</p>
<p>2. Discussion on Appropriation Notification According to the provisions of the implementation rules, after the bank or postal institution acting as the public treasury receives the payment order from the public treasury competent authority, it shall transfer the amount from the total deposit to the ordinary expenditure deposit account of the requesting agency and issue an "appropriation notification" to the requesting agency. The receiving agency shall fill out a receipt after receiving the payment notification from the public treasury competent authority and then claim it from the bank or postal institution acting as the public treasury (Articles 23 and 24 of the implementation rules, and Article 26, paragraph 2). Whether the receiving agency must wait until it receives the appropriation notification from the agent bank before it can fill out the receipt and claim the amount, or whether the receipt of the appropriation notification is irrelevant, there is no clear provision in the law.</p>
<p>Judging from the facts, the agent bank and the receiving agency are mostly in the same place. After the agent bank receives the payment order from the public treasury competent authority, it makes a transfer record and then fills out the appropriation notification and sends it to the receiving agency. The receiving agency receives the payment notification from the public treasury competent authority before receiving the appropriation notification (because the latter passes through the agent bank). Therefore, if the receiving agency can claim the amount only with the payment notification, the appropriation notification will be equal to a dummy and have no effect. Also, from the bank's point of view, since the law stipulates that an appropriation notification must be issued, it can be known that it will not allow payment before it is issued or before it is delivered, because the bank believes that the appropriation notification is one of the good payment vouchers. If there are no clear regulations on the procedures, unnecessary disputes will often occur.</p>
<p>Therefore, I believe that the implementation rules of the Public Treasury Law should have clear regulations, such as: the receiving agency must wait until it receives the appropriation notification from the agent bank before it can go to claim the amount together with the payment notification and the completed receipt. However, when the receiving agency receives the payment notification but not the appropriation notification, it can only inquire with the agent bank based on the notification.</p>
<p>3. General Regulations on the Qualifications of Bank Agents Our country's public treasury system is a bank deposit system, so the agent of the public treasury is a bank or postal institution. Regarding the selection of banks, the laws and regulations only indicate four principles: (1) The central bank shall be the principle for the national treasury. (2) For public treasury affairs at all levels other than the national treasury, local banks in the province, city, or county may be designated to act as agents where there is no central bank. (3) Where there is no local bank, other banks may be designated to act as agents, but they must first be approved by the superior government's public treasury competent authority (see the note in the first point of this article). (4) In places where there are no banks, the postal institution should be designated as an agent.</p>
<p>The so-called selection of "other banks" is not regulated by law and does not seem to have a standard to follow. For example, the nature of the bank, Chinese banks and foreign banks, the size of the bank's capital, the determination of the postal institution, etc., are quite problematic. Although its "designation" must be approved by the superior authority of the public treasury competent authority, although the law does not clearly state it, it should not be arbitrarily contacted and established. However, because there is no standard to follow, it will inevitably hinder it. In our country, official correspondence between government offices is often delayed for a long time, with many twists and turns, which will inevitably suffer from delays and lose its agility. Therefore, general regulations are essential for the implementation rules. For example, other banks should (1) be commercial banks in principle, followed by savings banks, and then agricultural banks (with the flexibility of capital turnover as the priority), (2) foreign banks shall not be designated except in special circumstances, (3) quasi-public-private banks should be designated first where there are quasi-public-private banks (reliable), (4) strong capital and stable operation should be the top priority (which can be obtained by analyzing the recent settlement statements of each bank), and (5) postal institutions refer to the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, and the post office may be designated where there is no Savings and Remittance Bureau.</p>
<p>4. Regulations on Property Trust According to the Public Treasury, the duties of the agent are two: (1) the receipt, payment, custody and transfer of public treasury cash bills and securities, and (2) the custody of property deeds. Property deeds refer to documents of ownership and warehouse receipts, bills of lading or other documents, this is clearly stipulated by law (Article 2 of this law, Article 2 of the implementation rules).</p>
<p>In fact, however, property is not only kept in custody but can also be used (for production or interest-bearing purposes) to maximize the economic benefits of the property and increase the income of public funds. This is the natural principle of financial management.</p>
<p>The purpose of establishing a public treasury system, in short, is two: one is to hope to unify income and expenditure, so as to achieve the effect of economic agility, and the other is to avoid self-management of income and expenditure, so as to prevent the disadvantages of cutting off and embezzling. Therefore, the use of property for profit shall not be handled by the administrative heads of each agency. This is not to measure a gentleman with the belly of a villain, but the basic principle of the public treasury system. Now that the custody of property is entrusted to the bank, its use should also belong to the same. However, entrusting the use is not a "deposit relationship" but a "trust relationship." Therefore, it is very clear that the contract originally signed by the public treasury competent authority and the agent bank should not be included incidentally and should be signed separately as a trust contract. However, the laws and regulations have not clearly stated this, nor is there any provision that can be applied.</p>
<p>I believe that the implementation rules of this law should have the necessity to regulate this, the main points of which are the qualifications of the trustee (whether it must or must not be assumed by the agent bank), the procedures for signing and its approval, etc.</p>
<p>5. Regulations on Accounting Year and Month The words "year," "daily report," "ten-day report," and "monthly report" are repeatedly mentioned in the Public Treasury laws and regulations, but there is no clear regulation on the starting and ending dates. According to the example of analogy in law, this point does not seem to be a problem, because the accounting year can be based on the Budget Law (Article 11 of the revised Budget Law), and the "daily" report and "ten-day" report can be based on the Accounting Law (Article 21 of the Accounting Law), and there should be no objection. However, from the three elements of legal thoroughness, consistency, and certainty, it is still necessary to regulate in the Public Treasury laws and regulations. For example, the accounting year has already been regulated in the Budget Law, and Article 21, paragraph 1 of the Accounting Law still has the phrase "the beginning and end of the accounting year shall be in accordance with the regulations of the Budget Law," which is the reason for this. Therefore, I believe that the implementation rules of the Public Treasury Law should have similar regulations as listed above: "The accounting year shall be in accordance with the regulations of the Budget Law. The determination of the day, ten days, and month shall be in accordance with the regulations of the Accounting Law." It is also to show the legal thoroughness, consistency, and certainty.</p>
<p>I remember eight or nine years ago, there was a loud slogan, "Down with corrupt officials!" Considering the reality, greed and corruption all refer to financial fraud. Since the Ming and Qing dynasties, it has been very rare for those who entered officialdom to remain clean. Why is this? Because the financial administration is extremely chaotic, and most of the administrative heads also manage finance, and it is easy to embezzle and intercept. After the establishment of the National Government, it was determined to govern clearly and severely punish corrupt officials, but it was mostly inclined to be passive and to punish after the fact. In recent years, efforts have been made to improve accounting and politics, and there have been some achievements. Now, the establishment of a public treasury system and the clear order to implement the Public Treasury Law are another warning to corrupt officials and are what our people are happy to hear. Therefore, the author has tried not to avoid his own shallowness and wrote an article to introduce it before the implementation, in order to welcome this great event in financial history. Now, I will express my own views to contribute to the authorities and colleagues, as an expectation of throwing a brick to attract jade. December 1939 at Fudan University</p>
<h3 id="e90">The Abrogation of the US-Japan Treaty and the Shanghai Black Market <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>— Cao Linye</p>
<p>Japan is a country with innate deficiencies, and all the necessities for industry are completely dependent on the supply from other countries. The needs during wartime increase as consumption increases. As for the detailed statistical figures, they are unknown because they have stopped being published since July 1936. In peacetime, Japan's annual needs for heavy industrial raw materials are roughly as follows:</p>
<p>Steel 4.441 (thousand tons) Unknown</p>
<p>Pig iron 4.195 30%</p>
<p>Iron ore 13.248 90% Obtained from our country, India, the United States, etc.</p>
<p>Scrap iron 1.497 50% Completely supplied by the United States</p>
<p>Coal 4.42 Unknown Some are supplied by our country as well as active producers</p>
<p>Petroleum 85.523 90% Obtained from the British, American, and American-occupied areas %</p>
<p>Japan's main source of raw materials is now in fact only the United States. However, because Japan's invasion of China has sacrificed American interests in China, and the American people absolutely sympathize with China's war of resistance, the US-Japan Treaty has been abrogated.</p>
<p>After the abrogation of the US-Japan Treaty, the only way for Japan to obtain raw materials from the United States is to seize them in Shanghai. It is not that Shanghai is the place of production of these raw materials, but that they can be purchased from the United States in Shanghai. Naturally, the Japanese will use unscrupulous merchants to purchase on their behalf. However, the Japanese currency will plummet. The foreign exchange rate will change greatly. However, the exchange rate of the legal tender will remain unchanged. This is because the legal tender is only acting as a medium. The recent depreciation of the Japanese puppet currency against the legal tender is the reason for this.</p>

<p>Mr. Yi Ziqing inquired, and Mr. Wang Haibo replied as follows:</p>
<p>Question: In the "Shanghai Newspaper Commercial News" (12th of last month) column, it states "Tianjin telegraphic transfer to Shanghai exchanges three yuan for one hundred and seven yuan." Does this mean that delivering Tianjin local legal tender of one hundred and seven yuan in Tianjin will receive one hundred yuan in Shanghai?</p>
<p>Answer: It means delivering Tianjin legal tender of one hundred and seven yuan will receive one hundred yuan of legal tender in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Question: Also, "Joint Notes" traded at 96 yuan, up half a yuan. Does this mean that one hundred yuan of legal tender in Tianjin can purchase ninety-six yuan of Joint Notes?</p>
<p>Answer: It means that one hundred yuan of legal tender in Tianjin can buy ninety-six yuan of "Joint Notes," but this is an illegal act.</p>
<p>Question: What is the meaning of "under the table" in the above question? What is the value of each "Joint Note" in shillings? Are there restrictions on purchasing foreign exchange with "Joint Notes" in Tianjin?</p>
<p>Answer: "Under the table" here is interpreted as illegal. "Joint Notes" cannot be used to purchase foreign exchange. They must first be exchanged for legal tender before they can be used for purchase.</p>
<p>Mr. Li Wenyu inquired: "Is legal tender with North China place names (such as Peiping, Tianjin, Shandong, etc.) generally usable in the interior?"</p>
<p>Answer: As far as this reporter knows, it is redeemed by inland banks, but cannot be generally used in the interior.</p>

<h3 id="e95">Eating Sycees <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Liang</p>
<p>Sycees were a type of currency in ancient times, including gold sycees and silver sycees, used to exchange for goods. Whoever had more sycees was the wealthy person. Over time, sycees have long disappeared, replaced by colorful legal tender. Even the homes of true millionaires may not be able to find a single sycee in their silver chests. It is easy to imagine what other people's homes might be like. Perhaps one can still see a wooden one during the "adding officials" performance on stage.</p>
<p>Although sycees have disappeared, people still consider them precious and lovely. Beggars deeply understand this mentality, and when begging, they always offer auspicious and prayerful words: "Big boss, congratulations on earning sycees all year round." The big boss may, for the sake of the sycees, generously give him two cents for a tram ticket. In these recent days, the sound of sycees has become even more pervasive, not only spoken but also materialized, and even edible. Eating sycees is indeed a miracle, wouldn't it be like "swallowing gold!"</p>
<p>Once explained, it is not surprising. It turns out that this is precisely the long-standing custom and habit that has been reformed but not eliminated. At the New Year's banquet, almost every dish is a substitute for sycees. Pork hocks are sycees, pig trotters are also sycees, soy sauce eggs are sycees, and meat-filled egg dumplings are also sycees. Other foods such as clams, carp, and even salty baked long-life fruits are all sycees. The host raises his chopsticks and invites: "Come, come, let's eat sycees." The guest declines with humility, accepts with shame, and offers a new year's greeting: "Congratulations on your household's constant flow of sycees." The host is naturally happy: "Thank you, thank you, everyone gets rich, everyone earns sycees." Thus, cups are exchanged, and the host and guests part happily.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Four Keys to Prolonging the Life of a Felt Hat <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>— Zhao Shi</p>
<p>Newspapers best serve the social population through prompt service. The best form of service advertisement is also called service. Recently, a British hat factory that sells particularly expensive felt hats always inserts a piece of paper inside the hat, clearly stating four conditions for those who are good at using hats, ensuring they can return the hat for exchange.</p>
<p>"1. Do not expose to excessive dust, brush gently daily.</p>
<p>2. Do not allow unclean hats to get excessively wet.</p>
<p>3. Do not touch this hat with dirty hands.</p>
<p>4. If the hat is not worn on the head, store it properly immediately."</p>
<p>Those who are good at using hats are said to preserve the color and shape without change, meaning without discoloration or change in appearance.</p>
<p>"If the hat user fulfills the above four conditions and still finds any non-compliance, a return for exchange is guaranteed."</p>
<p>Purchasers, seeing that the British factory's hats specifically note methods for long-term use, are driven by a desire for knowledge, deeply trusting the factory's products. Consequently, the factory's goods spread far and wide without promotion. This is the effect of psychology.</p>
<p>Our country faces resource constraints. Whether it is clothing, food, housing, or transportation, we should conduct in-depth research. If merchants know to emulate the service spirit of advertising experts in advanced countries, providing detailed usage instructions to benefit compatriots, while also enhancing the reputation of national products, it would be a new opening, truly a win-win situation.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Year-End Dinner <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Mengzhao</p>
<p>Another year has passed easily. Today (the 12th) is again the "Fifth Day of the New Year" (also known as the God of Wealth Day) in the lunar calendar. According to custom, every old-fashioned industrial and commercial organization must have a grand "Year-End Dinner" on this day, saying that after eating it, everyone will surely get rich throughout the year. Chinese people emphasize "eating" and also emphasize "money." Everyone cannot help but blurt out, "What is life for?"</p>
<p>In the customs of Wuxi merchants, the "Fifth Day of the Year" is also called the "Bedding Birthday." The departure and retention of staff are decided on the eve (the fourth day of the new year). Managers deliberate on which staff members are diligent, honest, and hardworking; and which are irresponsible and absurd. The diligent are retained, and the absurd are dismissed. Beforehand, staff members are very secretive about the issue of their job retention, kept in the dark, and must wait until the "Year-End Dinner." If there is no place for them, they will be shocked and realize that they will be packing up and leaving. Therefore, friends who have a seat at the Year-End Dinner are all smiles, overjoyed. The unfortunate brothers inevitably knit their brows, and sorrow arises from within. In fact, breaking through the magic mirror, can managers truly base retention and dismissal on the standards of diligence and laziness in the past year? That is not necessarily the case, because people with nepotistic connections often occupy important positions, as stable as Mount Tai. Despite being absurd at ordinary times, when it comes to eating the Year-End Dinner, they always sit in the seat of honor. Therefore, the anger and resentment in the hearts of those who are dismissed is truly "unable to complain, like a mute eating Coptis chinensis." From this point of view, although the "Year-End Dinner" is delicious, it is indeed somewhat edible but not edible.</p>

<p>— Ms. Hua Ying</p>
<p>Among the New Year dishes, one thing occupies a very important position, and that is vermicelli. The vermicelli we usually buy is always soaked in water, but at the end of the lunar year, dried vermicelli appears on the market. Probably every household, large or small, has dried vermicelli; because a hot pot is indispensable for the New Year's dinner, and vermicelli is indispensable in the hot pot. Speaking of the price of vermicelli, it was only twenty cents a pound before the war, but now it has risen to more than one yuan. It is really shockingly high, but because it is indispensable in the hot pot, everyone has to endure the pain and eat it. Vermicelli itself has no taste and relies entirely on the fresh soup to help it. Apart from being used in hot pot, it doesn't seem to go well with other meat dishes. In vegetarian dishes, it can be stir-fried with pickled mustard greens, spinach, or green vegetables, or it can be blanched yellow in hot oil and then braised with wheat gluten and dried tofu. There are no other new variations. White dried vermicelli is considered superior, and yellow vermicelli becomes mushy and unpalatable once cooked.</p>

<h3 id="e99">Adapting to the European War Environment in Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>— Tian Shi, from The Hague</p>
<p>The Second European War, which began in September 1939, although not as widespread as it was twenty-five years ago, has greatly changed the clothing, food, housing, and transportation of Europeans. I will mention a few things to illustrate the rest.</p>
<p>First, clothing. The easiest thing to change with the times in Western society is women's clothing. The women's clothing that is particularly convenient during wartime, originating in London and Paris and popular in major cities, mostly adopts dark green or dark red in the style of grapes, or brown in different shades, and the fabric always has light-colored patterns or light-colored decorations. Skirts must be shortened to save materials. The price of tailor-made coats is particularly high, making it most inconvenient to change with the times. The difference between wartime and peacetime is only to add a light-colored belt on top. Gloves should match the color of the coat, mostly using dark colors with light-colored inlays. Raincoats should be changed to buy slightly lighter colors. The use of light colors as embellishments in the above items is entirely to avoid collisions during dark runs during air raid alarms. Shoes should be warm colors of brown-red or dark green. Rubber overshoes and long boots should be purchased as soon as possible, fearing that the lights will suddenly go out during an alarm and standing water on the road cannot be seen. At the same time, women's handbags should be enlarged so that they can also store emergency flashlights and large, unsightly gas masks. Men's clothing and footwear all remain the same, except that they must wear light-colored metal lapel pins, badges, school badges, or hat badges before going out every day to prevent collisions in the dark under the alarm. In addition, the knitting of lines by women can enable trapped people to forget panic and worry at any time and anywhere through work, such as when traffic is blocked, trains are delayed halfway, and those who are idle in a small room under light control can use knitting to pass the time, while the knitted winter clothes are also convenient for comforting and rescuing compatriots in distress or sending them to soldiers on the front line. It is truly a win-win situation.</p>
<p>Second, food. Digestion is sufficient to affect the health of the body. In wartime, people should prioritize health care. Those who live in the rear eat too much meat, which harms digestion. Meat is an acid-producing food, unlike vegetables, which are alkalizing foods. Meat eaters cannot exert force for a long time and are easily fatigued, and even suffer from nephritis, or lead to high blood pressure. Prevention cannot be started too soon. Common people suffer from stomach diseases and cannot eat, half due to nervous action. Medical experts, drawing lessons from the previous European War, have seen that soldiers who go to the front lines, because they have no time to think about stomach diseases, often find that their suffering is suddenly cured. Those who linger in the rear can still feel the suffering of indigestion. To avoid this suffering, the first thing to do is to choose food. First, eat small, very oily things. When eating fatty items, only eat dishes made with butter or vegetable oil. Second, do not eat too much bread. Third, do not indulge in baked meat. Fourth, do not eat irritants such as pepper and mustard. Fifth, drinking alcohol should not be too drunk. Sixth, eat slowly.</p>
<p>Third, housing. In wartime, the health of the body is certainly very important, but the adjustment of the spirit is even more urgent. The first requirement of living is sleep. Sufficient sleep doubles the spirit, and the efficiency of work will definitely double. The card games of Eastern society are most harmful to body and mind. According to Western experts, six or seven hours of sleep may be enough to satisfy the physical labor, but those who use their minds to govern the rear should have at least eight or nine hours of sleep every night. Taking the experience of the previous European War as an example, the soldiers on the front lines are actually easier to fall asleep than the people in the bombed areas in the rear. If the soldiers on the front lines do not get a good sleep after a major battle, then in a few days, the elite soldiers will turn into a defeated army. Therefore, the latest method of the First European War was to first seek appropriate allocation, so that those who exerted effort on the front line could have timely alternation and rest, and the people in the rear should know the indispensability of sleep. Another requirement of living is that men and women can live together in peace and harmony. In wartime, all industries are tense, and quarrels and conflicts are inevitable due to dissatisfaction with home life. Westerners call it easy to get angry as having a "hot temper." Judging from today's scientific perspective, it may be possible to control it with mental treatment. The method should be to have the man and woman who are prone to anger diligently write a diary, and write down and remember in detail the words or actions that caused anger each time. The technique of treating anger lies in being able to know how anger arises and when it will arise, and from then on, control it. It is naturally twice the result with half the effort. Conversely, if men and women living together can mention the person they love and the thing they like to recall at any time, it is also a wonderful way to calm anger, thereby overcoming adversity and reaching a smooth situation.</p>
<p>Fourth, transportation. Whether warring countries or neutral countries, they all know to save kerosene and avoid using motorized means of transportation. Vacations and car trips are particularly prohibited, and bicycles are used instead. For a time, the bicycle business profited tenfold. Her Majesty Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands, as the head of state, also personally rides a bicycle to go out. This is in stark contrast to the situation in China, where important figures abandon cars and take rickshaws.</p>

<p>— Ye Yufan</p>
<p>My roommate, Mr. L, has been suffering terribly these past few days. When he comes back in the evening, he stands on the second floor and shouts to his younger brother:</p>
<p>"Lei Sheng! Come up! Come up! It's getting late."</p>
<p>The reply is: "There are still two rounds to go." Still the crisp sound of bamboo tiles.</p>
<p>This set of "winter vacation homework" is like this day and night. I live on the third floor, Mr. L's family lives on the second floor, and below is the so-called "Shanghai landlord." The landlord's room is simply a hotbed of mahjong (mahjong atmosphere). Several of his children also play a good hand, which truly deserves the title "teaching children well" (Square City).</p>
<p>Mr. L's younger brother, who is also a junior high school student, spends almost every day during the winter vacation immersed in mahjong and Twenty-one. Sometimes, he goes out with friends for snacks and, when he's happy, he even runs to the jai alai court.</p>
<p>This is indeed a realistic theme worthy of attention. Schools cannot do without vacations, but it is questionable that young students with vacations waste their time like this. Moreover, in the vacation, the winds of gambling and the formation of nonsense, ruin the youth in this furnace, which is not the original intention of the school to give vacations. Therefore, it is necessary to awaken the attention of parents, otherwise, the future is worrying. Mr. L's younger brother, the roommate, is a realistic specimen.</p>

<p>— Ji Fufang</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang borrowed ten yuan from a friend and said to Mrs. Zhang when he got home, "Mr. He recommended this matter to me, and I haven't thanked him yet. Now that it's the end of the year, I should give some gifts." Mrs. Zhang also agreed. So he bought a few pounds of New Year cakes and a ham and sent them to the He family.</p>
<p>When he went to give the gifts, it happened that Old Mrs. Li was eating at the He family. She saw Mrs. Zhang giving gifts and discussed it with her son when she got home, "The Zhang family's friendship with the He family is about the same as ours. They gave gifts, and we can't avoid it either." Her son always obeyed his mother, so he took out ten yuan and asked her to buy New Year gifts.</p>
<p>When the gift was sent to the He family, Mrs. He felt bad again. She told her husband, "This gift from Old Mrs. Li cannot be accepted for nothing." So the next day, the He family sent gifts to the Li family again.</p>
<p>Old Mrs. Li saw that most of the gifts were sweets, which she and her son didn't like very much, so she took two pieces at random and sent them to the Xu family next door, just to be kind.</p>
<p>But the Xu family couldn't accept her gift for nothing, and they were also trying to send a gift.</p>
<p>In the cries of difficult life, giving gifts is not what people willingly want, but only中了"人情", "心愿"的毒。</p>

<p>"Shanghai As It Is" Essay Contest</p>
<p>Shanghai indeed has a part of the population suffering from the cruel oppression of work, resting all day long, but most of them are almost busy for entertainment and running around for entertainment.</p>
<p>There are many idle people on the streets, pacing their square steps. There are many boring people in teahouses and bathrooms, leisurely discussing their nonsense.</p>
<p>No matter what play is being performed in the theater, they all put up a full house sign. Escort companies are springing up like mushrooms after the rain. Prostitutes are trekking from east to west from time to time; all to solve the "entertainment" hunger and thirst of the Shanghainese.</p>
<p>Except for those who make a living by gambling, everyone regards money gambling as an "entertainment item." Although they gamble every day, they would never admit that this is their daily routine, but just "entertainment entertainment." For the sake of "entertainment," the threshold of the casino is almost worn through, and almost every room in the hotel is fighting in Square City. The sound of tiles can be compared with the sound of gunfire, and "ancient people" such as Zhang Jiuguan and Zhang Sanhuai will be memorized by heart.</p>
<p>There are many, many other entertainments that are too numerous to mention. For the sake of entertainment, everyone is a busy person. So Shanghai is prosperous, the cars on the road are like flowing water and the horses are like dragons, and it is also filled with a group of crowded pedestrians. Emerging industries are booming, and unpopular things are also taken into account, let alone the fact that vain dreams will be noticed and cherished.</p>
<p>Time continues to come, never ending. And the Shanghainese just want to kill the current time in order to welcome the time in the future.</p>

<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 20 World Transportation, Common Language, Children's Education, Scholarship, Pity for Talent</p>
<p>Jiang Jingrong lost his father at the age of eight. He was an orphan, and his family was poor. After his father's death, he had no family property. Fortunately, his mother was very virtuous. At that time, the old Chinese morality regarded remarriage as unchaste. Although Jiang Jingrong's mother was only twenty-nine years old, she thought: I have a son and two daughters. Dragging a group of children, marrying a husband again will definitely make them suffer. Moreover, after marrying a husband, who knows if they will not have more children, and the children of the former husband and the children of the latter husband will be divided. Therefore, she preferred to remain chaste and raise her orphans, relying on her ten fingers to do some needlework, which actually enabled Jiang Jingrong to graduate from elementary school. The more orphaned children are, the more diligent they are. In addition, Jiang Jingrong was intelligent and achieved higher grades than other students in school. However, after graduating from elementary school, Jiang Jingrong's mother could no longer afford to send her son to middle school. Unlike modern China, elementary school is completely free, and the state assumes the obligation of educating its citizens. Middle schools also charge very little tuition, making it easy for citizens to afford. Jiang Jingrong was thirteen years old at that time. He said that he was unable to go to school, so he did not want to go to school. He loved his sisters very much. His two sisters, one was nine years old and the other was seven years old, had not yet attended elementary school. He would rather not go to middle school himself and send his two sisters to elementary school, even if his two sisters could not all go to elementary school, first send his older sister to elementary school and delay his younger sister for a while. Because his older sister is nine years old this year and can no longer delay. Fortunately, when Jiang Jingrong was studying in higher elementary school, he would definitely teach his two sisters every night when he came back, like a small teacher. Now that his older sister has entered elementary school, his younger sister can still be taught by himself, or it would be best to be able to send his younger sister to elementary school next semester if he can afford it. Because his older sister was taught by her older brother, the small teacher, at home, she was promoted to the third grade as soon as she entered elementary school, which made Jiang Jingrong particularly happy. Originally, the reason why he did not continue to middle school after graduating from elementary school was, firstly, because middle school tuition was very expensive and his mother could not afford it; secondly, he thought that although he was a child, he also wanted to help his mother and wanted to find a job. It was a pity that there were very few job opportunities for children in China at that time. To be an apprentice in that kind of shop or factory was simply like being a slave or a servant, and his mother would not send him in. Later, he found a job as a newspaper boy himself. No matter how cold or hot it was, he always ran around every day, always delivering newspapers for people to read. Because of his diligence, his life was not bad. (236)</p>
<h3 id="e105">"Diligence Flag" to Prevent New Year's Truancy <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>— Encouragement</p>
<p>Now that all elementary schools have started and classes are about to begin, the current abolished lunar New Year falls within class time. Because families are celebrating the New Year with joy, elementary school students are bound to play truant. They will play at home, and the school will become a situation where "students abandon the teacher."</p>
<p>The best solution is naturally for parents to urge their children to go to school. The school should also indirectly persuade or reward students for attending classes. Now, I have a method to offer to the principals of elementary schools for reference. This is to make several small flags with the word "Diligence" written on them. Make a daily statistic and award the flag to the class with the highest attendance during the New Year to show encouragement. Because these small flags are considered by the innocent elementary school students to be a great honor and prestige. Once they get the "Diligence Flag," they are unspeakably happy, encouraging each other, and hoping to obtain it again tomorrow. Those who have not received it will definitely work hard to promote attendance so that classmates do not miss classes without reason, and thereby capture the prize flag.</p>
