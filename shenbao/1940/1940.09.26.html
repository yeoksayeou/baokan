<p>重慶　據尚未證實之消息、桂省西南之華軍、會進攻開入越南日軍之後方、此閒對於法方抵抗消息、自皆表歡迎、各報皆謂此非抗議而為奮鬥之時、華軍不應以防守邊境為滿足、實應越境、並予法軍以援助云、（二十五日路透電）</p>
<p>重慶　國民政府昨為越南事件開會討論、各重要人員均出席、聆取外長王寵惠與軍政部長何應欽關於越南最近發展之報告、後據宣布、政府決議依頂定政策與計畫進行一切、滇省當局現正忙於組織全省之壯丁、每二三縣長、須共同組成一分隊、負責於承平時維持地方秩序治安、遇戰事延至本地時、則須輔助正規軍作戰、（二十五日路透電）</p>
<p>河內　日軍復作劇烈之進攻後、前錢消息、今晨卽已斷絕、據官方宣稱「日軍破壞法日協定、越南實難容忍」、又官方公報稱、「日本華南軍隊在北部邊境、設有攻擊行為、越南當局誓以武力抵抗」、然該公報復又表示、越南對於上星期日准許日軍一定數額經由海防入越之協定、仍舊頂備予以實行、同時官方消息、渠等業已接獲東京之保證、謂日方已令華南軍隊停止進攻、唯以河內與諒山消息斷絕、日軍是吾業已停止攻擊、今日此間實無法探悉、至據前綫於消息未斷時最後之報告、則知日軍企圖佔領重　路綫、諒山區域鏖戰正酣、官方又稱、昨日日軍進攻、會向諒山四周交通要道推進、雖正面向法軍之砲壘、然日軍利用黑暗之隱蔽，確已越過法軍防綫、推進若干距離、刻諒山哥培公路上之克西鎭與沿諒山孟開公路之落平區域、據報已被日軍佔領、（廿五日合衆電）</p>

<p>河內　華南之日軍顯已忽視星期日在此間所簽訂之法日協定、昨日下午對越南邊境捲土重來，作大規模之攻擊、據法方消息、此决日軍之進攻復集中於諒山之四圍、該地乃重要之鐵路城鎮、日軍前日在該處被阻時、嘗遭慘重之損失、此間接獲米經證實消息稱、法軍於星期一俘獲日兵二百名，法方之正式死亡表目前僅有二十名、星期一夜開抵此閒之救護火車一列、載傷兵一百名、越南法軍昨日均枕戈等待日軍之第二步動靜、叉昨晨沿廣西邊界之諒山附近、　發生數度小接觸、然大戰迄午後始重啟、日本軍事代表團有領西原離開此閒入華境、聞擬勸說廣州軍隊停止進攻越南、西原氏離開後並未聞有何消息、相信渠已抵達廣州或海南島、法國官方於消上星期日所訂之河內協定後、昨晚宣稱、全部局勢全視西原少將勸說廣州軍隊離開越南之能否成功而定、海防之日本運輪艦昨晨曾開始放下小艇、準備派兵登陸‘然嗣後又將小艇曳起開出海防、方向不明、昨日中午河內發出第三次空襲警報、然無日機出現、昨日此間牆壁發現標語、告市內無重大事務之民眾速行撤退、日方通知法國、謂將於黎明發動大進攻、並開始轟炸海防、然昨晨越南及廣西邊境情形安　法日兩方軍隊均紮陣對峙、據邊境消息稱、法軍已克復同登、安南軍隊曾於日軍以堅強之抵抗、由邊境歸來之觀察家稱、日軍向諒山之進攻、遭創極重、諒山地方法軍堅強砲壘之大砲令日軍遭受重大傷亡、渠謂道旁日兵死屍堆積、日軍因無法收埋此輩屍體、乃將各屍雙手所下、以便日後憑指紋認領、各據點之法軍現均奉命於日軍未開火前、不准開槍、今晨有日本轟炸機十二架飛過　防示威、但並未投彈、法方高射砲亦未加以射擊、此間學校現均停課、市民則聽報紙之勸告實行撤退、中國領事亦勸告華人逐漸疏散云、（二十五日合眾電）</p>

<p>維希　法國政府昨日向日本抗議、責其不應令華南日軍侵略越南、法國抗議並正式聲明日本應負越南邊境戰事之責，據稱該抗議書責備日本破壞河內協定、因該協定只許日軍取道海防入越南、而非取道廣西八越南也、同時中國使館宣稱、中國政府已　書面抗議一件、送交法政府、以抗議河內協定之內容、中國之抗議書謂「該項協定意「令日軍能向中國進行戰爭、實係違反法國一切條約之義務、即與法國外交中立、及善鄰之精神、亦相反牴觸、」中國使館發言人稱、於星期日法協定未簽定以前、中國曾迭次否認中國軍隊有越境之情事、（二十五日合眾電）</p>

<p>香港　據今晨此問所獲來自河內之遲到消息、廣州日軍於星期二下午父圖自諒山區攻入越南、河內消息又稱、星期　正午會停戰、但日軍向諒山區增援後、下午卽續行進攻、另一報告稱、越南　隊曾俘獲日軍二百名、法方承認法軍死傷二十名、接近廣州日軍司令者、對於日軍與東京之外交人員今日曾起衝突一節有所述、據稱華南日軍司令自謂入越之舉，謀出於彼、且緊持彼之駐桂日軍、必須開入越南、廣州日軍無錢電臺首先「指摘」越南當局允許輸運品至重慶、並予重慶以援助、東京之採取入越政策、卽因此故、（二十五日國際社電）</p>

<h3 id="c2">再度動盪之越南問題 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>擾攘達三閱月之法日越南談判，既於日方通牒期滿前之瞬息，以建設「東亞新秩序」及「以軍事上某種便利畀予日本陸軍」而簽訂協定；而越南除主權領土完整已不獲保全外，且亦未能享有日夕之苟安。三書夜來，慘烈戰禍方繼續籠罩於越南邊境，使法越當局不能不於屈服之後，重申抵抗決心；而東四半球，亦悉為此奇詭反常之變化所刺激，益感對遠東危局之不容坐視。此一演變，終將何所底止，於今固難確言，而前此法越之屈辱，則愈足證明為莫大之失策。夫委屈求全，心境已至凄苦，如其能倖獲瓦全，則縱蒙不義不勇之愆，亦未嘗不可假苟全為解嘲；今則屈辱有加而安全未獲，復不能不於凄苦之中勉為激勵，重鼓一度頹唐之餘勇，其處境固堪同情，顧亦大可慨歎矣。</p>
<p>此决法越之失，失在輕信：一則誤以為日方必守信義，條的既獲締結，則條的外之權利尚可保持；二則根本不認識日方慣用之二重以至多重之外交，以為交涉之當事者必能代表對方全體。乃不虞簽的之墨瀋未乾，邊界之兵戎驟起。夫背信毀的，罔顧道義，固今日之侵略者所優為，而毀的之適發生於簽的之同時，尚為往例所未聞。衡之今夏德義對法之納降，的款既訂，即一了百了，初未聞屢起勃谿或誅求無厭；彼以戰勝國而臨戰敗國猶且不為已甚，則今茲日本之於法越，實為常理所難想像。世人每以德義與日本等量齊觀，併列之侵略國家之列，及今觀之，彼此相去，抑何懸殊？侵略一名詞，固未足以盡括其間之重大差異，此世人所宜深刻認識者也。</p>
<p>今後越南前途休戚關鍵，不在法越，而在日本：不在維希河內當局，而在法越軍民；不在法越與日本之關係，而在環繞越南問題諸列強之動向。此度越日糾紛之再起，既緣於日方破壞條的所允許之限度，而非法越當局根本有所悔悟，倘日方稍能懸崖勒馬，歛抑就範，姑以條的所允為未來進一步行動之起點，則未必不能以比較和緩之面目易取其所需索之權益，而法越當局方慮寒盟之為患，亦不難進而有所作為。故曰不在法越，而在日本。此際維希河內當局方處於和戰歧途，世人自當不吝予以策勉，冀其轉趨堅強，善自補過；然而就其此際處境觀之，苟非德義力加支持，亦必不能於千荊萬棘之中，毅然堅拒越南方面之屈辱。則世人與其矚望於法越當局，實無寗期之於法越之忠勇軍民；亦唯有此輩軍民始能是正其己往之大錯，為戰敗之法國爭取新的前途。故曰不在法越當局，而在法越軍民。此度法越屈服之諉過於英美之小予助力，固適足證明其初乏抵抗決心；而保衛越南之任務，亦誠非今日之法越獨力所能勝任。中國固已以決心昭示世界矣，至於英美不容改變越南現狀聲明之能吾收效，亦惟有視其能吾於考慮中之聯防措置而外，更立即出於積極有效之行動。故曰不在法越與日本，而在有關諸列強。此非於法越當局有所輕忽，顧觀其近頃所發布之種種文告，惟有使人對其前途益增悲觀。駐美法使亨利海昨固有越日協定已因日方破壞而取消一語，空谷足音，彌足珍視，但惜尚乏有力佐證、證明其為確屬事實耳。</p>
<p>遠東與歐洲之兩組戰爭，向在不同之性質與範圍下各自進行；自越南糾紛惡化後，世人觀感每以為此兩組戰爭殆將以越南為契機而合為一體，而軸心國之義大利，亦頗重視日之侵入越境，謂為對英之重大威脅。實則迄今日本之外交立塲，仍超然於歐戰雙力交戰國之外，無所左右或偏袒，而唯擴展自身權益之是圖。日之厚植勢力於南洋，固深為英美之患，然亦豈德義之幸？與其視此舉為日本對軸心國家之響應，實無寗謂為意在於德義未獲確定勝利之前預佔機先，以防德義於南太平洋戰敗國屬領中攫取其一臠。另一方面，於此亦足見英美已往對日讓步，以冀收為已助之一無是處；經此教訓，此後實不必多所顧忌，徒自損抑。蓋歐洲戰事與遠東危局始終屬於兩種性質兩種範疇：越南問題固足牽動列強，此後糾紛愈擴大，牽涉必愈廣泛亦愈深入，而其絕小足以影響歐洲雙方交戰國之進退？且亦不致引起歐亞兩組戰事之合流，則此際所可斷言者也</p>

<p>維希　法國各報對於英國海軍攻擊西菲法屬達加爾港一事、咸稱為英法關係史上之轉捩點、「巴黎晚報」申稱、特戈爾會保證決不進攻法人、今竟背信失言、憑藉英國海軍殘殺同胞、其為叛國逆跡、彰彰明甚、「辯論報」亦斥達加爾之攻擊為瘋狂之罪行、」（二十五日海通電）</p>
<p>倫敦　聞率領英艦隊攻擊達加爾之海軍大將提出二决哀的美敦書、要求該港投降遭拒絕後、達加爾之戰役、刻正賡續激烈進行中、維希方面承認迄今已有法潛艇「普西」號被英方擊沉、惟稱、特戈爾將軍之軍隊、四度在魯非斯開登陸、及在達加爾兩度登岸、皆被擊退、今日倫敦方面聲稱、防杜法屬赤道非洲落入德手之手事行動雖在賡續中、然賴特戈爾將軍之精神與決心及軍民之愛國情緒、法屬赤道非洲終將歸於自由法國旗織之下、毫無疑義、據自由法軍司令部發表公報稱、特戈爾將軍係於德義人侵入西非而控制航空根據地時、始決定攻擊達加爾、進攻軍隊有陸海空三軍、自由法海軍之戰艦護送法軍、至於英海軍在塲、不過給予補充之保護、以防德方倐施之攻擊耳、達加當局首先法人展開戰事之責、蓋法軍圖作和平登陸時、達加爾當局卽向法艦開火、致船員死數人傷多人、特戈爾將軍為避免法人自相作戰起見、遂率其軍隊退泊遠處、然達加爾當局仍對法軍轟擊不已、英艦乃開始行動、溯自休戰以還、法屬西非曾有種種表示與行動、贊成特戈爾將軍發動之賡續抗戰、（二十五日路透電）</p>
<p>維希　官方頃發表公報稱、英國艦隊會於昨晨九時三十分至十時三十分之間、向法屬西非達加爾港開砲猛轟、同時該國飛機則轟炸法國主力艦「黎舒留」號、（該艦前在北非奧朗港、被英國軍艦重創、尚未修復、）但未命中法國海岸砲隊與空軍均曾還擊、英國巡洋艦一艘、被巨型炸彈一枚所擊中、是役法方陣亡海陸士兵一百二十名、受傷者上百三十八名、平民罹難者六十二人、受傷者二百二十五人、迨至午後一時、英國艦隊又復開砲轟擊、歷三十分鐘之久、死傷人數尚未確悉、但必較晨間為多云、（二十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>倫敦　今晨抵此之消息稱、在地位狹小僅能作偏舷直射操演之達加爾港內、有十二艘以上之英軍艦、與法軍艦七艘於昨夜交換砲彈、英國戰艦二艘巡洋艦四艘以及輔助艦若干艘、自法屬西非總督拒絕第二决勸降之最後通牒後、卽向法艦隊與達加爾港頻頻齊放祝砲、據此問官方稱、特戈爾將軍所統「自由法軍」登陸之企圖、在達加爾守兵向特氏之軍隊開砲轟擊時、卽經放棄、但官方又頂示、英海軍不久卽將控制全局、而可派遣充分之軍隊登陸、足以與達加爾守軍一戰、據佔計該處守軍的五千人、此間英當局稱、達加爾港法軍艦巳受重創、且岸上亦遭英海軍之大砲轟毀甚烈、（二十五日國際電）</p>
<p>倫敦　此閒各界人士均信英國之攻擊達加爾港、乃對德取大規模戰略上攻勢之前奏曲、因此英方之行動、非僅思將法屬非洲之管理權自維希政府手中奪獲而已、外交界倍苟戈特爾將軍第一决攻擊達加爾而告勝利、則渠將沿北非海岸而長驅直入、並可達到獲得對德作戰根據地之目的、此項方策為法國前總理萊諾所計劃、殆貝當執政、該計劃卽成泡影、自法殖民地諸總督屈服於貝當、萊諾自北非出攻之計遂不果行、然戈特爾將軍之價徒咸信法軍人曁民衆皆願繼續北戰、（編者按、一大部分之消息在此間被刪）英倫戰爭之最大特點、為縱使德方空襲殘酷、英國仍能遣其軍隊至各處作戰、因此英國已將希特勒之主要目標擊破、蓋德人迄未能阻止英人派遣其援軍至非洲及地中海中之要點、英國業已遣出大量援軍、非洲之戰亦決非軸心國之勝利、此舉蓋已瞭然、戈特爾將軍戰綫擴大之另一結果、或可以加強壓力、加諸西班牙、使其置身事外、而不屈服於軸心國之誘惑云、（二十五日國際社電）</p>
<p>法方發表戰事經過　法潛艇一艘被擊沉</p>
<p>維希方面法海軍部公報、宣佈法潛艇一艘在達加爾被擊沉事稱、本月二十三日英艦一隊計戰艦二艘。巡洋艦驅逐艦與運輸艦數艘、駛抵達加爾港外、特戈爾以哀的美敦書要求該城法當局投降、因遭拒絕、英艦隊遂向達加爾開火、雙方交戰、法潛艇」普西」號奮勇　擊英巡洋艦一艘時被擊沉、船員大半飲彈、惟該英巡洋艦亦被擊中、特戈爾指揮部下四度在魯非斯開及兩度在達加爾希圖登陸、皆被擊退、英艦隊當局遭此挫折、遂於午後一時三十分送出第二决哀的美敦書、謂苟非在二十四日午後六時前獻城、則渠不得不率英軍攻擊達加爾、而摧毀該港砲壘並將佔領之、法總督覆文稱、「法國已將達加爾託付本人、決守衛達加爾到底」、至此戰事遂復作、（二十五日路透電）</p>
<p>按被擊沉之法潛艇「普西」號、在水面時有排水量一三七九噸、潛水時為二〇六〇噸、有船員六十三名、裝魚雷管十一只、四吋口徑砲一尊、三·七生的高射砲一尊及機關槍一挺、多數艇員均脫險、（十五日海通電）</p>
<p>法機轟炸直布羅陀　對英行施報復手段</p>
<p>維希　官方公告宣稱、法機今日猛烈轟炸直布羅陀、使全部海峽成為「火燄山」、衆信法方下令轟炸直布羅陀、係對英攻襲達加爾港之「報復手段、（二十五日國際社電）</p>
<p>直布羅陀　此間發表公報、法國式飛機二十餘架、星期二日飛至直布羅陀投彈逾百枚、至少有一架被射落、炸彈爆發、死四人傷若干、房屋與道路亦有炸壞者、三處起小火、迅卽撲熄、分隔直布羅陀與西班牙拉里納之中立地帶、落彈多枚爆炸、（二十五日路透電）</p>
<p>維希　據法國政府公報宣稱、為報復英艦之轟擊達加爾港、法國空軍於昨日午後一時至三時、轟炸直布羅陀港、向兵工廠及海港投彈四十五噸、擊中船舶一艘、各處着彈起火、英國高射砲隊猛烈射擊、法機安然飛回、（二十五日海通電）</p>
<p>馬德里　據阿爾基西拉斯報告、英艦一隊內有巡　艦一艘·驅逐繼四艘·及潛艇二艘、駛過直布羅陀海峽、向大四洋方面航行、預料該項英艦隊係前往攻擊非洲之法國殖民地、（廿五日海通電）</p>
<p>美國當局密切注視　達加爾戰事之發展</p>
<p>華盛頓　此閒官方頃對達加爾戰爭之發展、嚴密注視、因戰爭之範圍較歷來任何戰事均為接近西半球、然官方又力言此决戰爭、一時與美國尚無直接之關碍、達加爾之軍事地位、最近數月來已引起此間甚多人士之評論、因達加爾之一端與南美洲相隔大西洋之距離甚近、距巴西僅一千六百海哩、覜察家相信、由法軍領袖特戈爾將軍曁其同盟英國、決不容許達加爾落於德人之手而成為攻擊英國航行之根據地、自地中海封鎖以來、美國赴西非洲之航行頗為增加、故一般以為美國艦隊或將要求使用距達加爾南五百五十哩之英海軍根據地自由城、尚有可注意者、卽八月問美國巳在達加爾設立一領事館、報界並認此舉為美國設立「前哨」（二十五日合衆電）</p>

<p>倫敦　航運大臣克勞斯、昨夜發表一文。陳說戰局第二年初期之地位、謂英國今日所統制之船隻噸數、視戰前為多、惟戰事進行不巳、船隻頓數之要求因以愈增、德國現所統制者、僅及其戰前船隻噸數三分之二、而航路亦以波羅的海與歐洲海岸綫之若干部分為限、義國處境與德國同、其所統制者亦僅戰前噸數四分之三耳、英國則異是、英方船隻雖遭潛艇、飛機、襲擊船、馬達快艇與水雷之攻擊、然現仍在海洋中行駛不斷、英商船百分之八遭敵方行動而喪失、惟英方捕獲之船、新造之船、與外國轉移之船、則不獨補足喪失之數、且有餘多、顧航運地位今不與戰前同一形勢、其故以前自歐洲運來之原料現須購自遠處、而原來取道地中海之船隻、今須繞道好望角而行也、加以許多船隻改作武裝巡艦、並有許多船隻專運製造軍炎所需之原料、以致尋常貨物所可得之舶隻噸位、大為減少，不過輸入與輸出之各種重大需要、英國仍有充分船隻以應付之耳、尚望民眾節省非必要品之購置、因英國目前輸入每月的在四五百萬噸之間、而在承平時代則為百萬噸也、（廿五日路透電）</p>

<p>希特勒對於「放任」報紙自由發表意見的各外國政府，表示輕蔑之意。我會聽見他說：「這些政府簡實是沒有背樑脊骨的。報紙應該遵照政府的意旨說話，不能指揮政府去做。保有一個自由的報紙，好像姑息一個潰瘍。言論自由的報紙就是一個潰瘍，在國家中實在是偭討厭的東西。」</p>
<p>口授公文旣畢，他便和政治軍事顧問們談話。別人對他如有隻字批評，他也不能容忍的。祇有戈林一人可算全德國中對他最敢說話的。然而他還是出以十分審愼的態度。</p>
<p>膳之後，希特勒往往與友人們作長夜之談，直到天明。他有幾個終身近侍都是善彈鋼琴的能手，當他覺得精神疲倦的時候，就叫他們中的一個奏曲消遣。他愛好瓦格涅的樂曲，和幾個德奧音樂家的激情繫奏。他痛恨「爵士」式跳舞音樂，常稱英美的音樂為「黑人的亂彈」。如果他在很夜深的時候去睡，而又反來覆去陲不着，便從牀上起來，軍返書室。。並把一個客人催促起來和他談話。郭倍爾住在他別墅中的時候，這個「好」差使總是他所承當的。他從牀上被拖起來，恭聽他領袖在幾小時中所草成的宣傳大計。郭倍爾老是坐在那里直到東方發白始已。入夜廚房中也不斷的有人侍候着，以備隨時叫喚　咖啡點心。</p>
<p>希特勒如果在夜閒小想讀書或談話，便常常坐了那巨型黑色汽車出外夜遊。我不時看見他的汽車午夜從車間裏開出來，一溜烟的開去了。他自己太膽小，從不自己駕駛。但是他倒歡喜開快車，他的車夫曾對我說，夜遊時的車行速率，每小時總在六十哩之上，有時竟達百英里之譜呢。</p>
<p>希特勒嚴防仇人的小算，無處不用其極。他最怕有人在食物中下毒。在他尚未進食前數小時，把所有的食物樣品，叫一個分析化學家加以澈底的試騐。希特勒對於單用口嘗有無毒質的試騐方法，還不放心，因為恐怕人家對他施以一種慢性中毒的暗箭。食品經過了化學家試騐之後，祇有四個廚子准許接觸它們。</p>
<p>他對付住宅中的侍從常常令人捉摸不定。有時候富你站在他面前時，他似乎一些也沒有注意到，那樣子眞是叫人難受呢。又有時候為了一些極微細的事情，他却要大發雷霆譬如整理了他的房間，或咖啡斟得稍多時。</p>
<p>他古怪的脾氣還多，往往為了一些很細瑣而以為擾及他的事情時，他竟會發瘋似的哭泣起來。他向那觸犯他的人說，這分明是故意的擾亂他，使他不能集中力心去做拯救德意志的大業，要是那人不立刻向他求恕，準有希望被送入集中營去受訓呢。然而有時候他却和順非凡，他對侍役們說，大家都是同工的伙伴，他廚子所肩負的責仟並不下於他的軍官。在他做了一樁「棘手的事情」之後，他的態度往往如此。</p>
<p>希特勒雖然不歡喜女人們濃裝厚抹，或故意的妖嬈作態，然他正與普通人一般，愛好俏麗的面孔和苗條的身段。在他每决的宴會中總要邀上五六位美女作陪。客人們在他的筵席上却並不十分暢快，原因為了吸烟和進酒都有限制，而希特勒又是只歡喜一種音樂調子的人，然而有誰敢被邀而不出席呢？</p>
<p>侍役們常以偷看客人們於希特勒小注意時一個個溜到別的房間裏去抽烟吸酒為樂。通常他們都是溜到黑衛隊長官的房間中去，另尋歡笑。如果弄得不巧，其中一個溜出去的客人被希特勒　覺時，那沒就有僕人去我他回來，恭聆「不告，而退」的訓責。</p>
<p>希特勒是個聽不慣笑的人人，允其是那些譏諷政治，謔而過虐的笑話。所以客人們在宴會席上沒有什麽談笑歡樂，祗不過像政治會議那樣的傾聽領袖一人說話而已。</p>
<p>希特勒凱旋盛況（紀事見前日本欄）</p>
<p>在希氏別墅中作客，須要遵守「來賓須知」上所規定的禁條。這種條規印成了單張放在客人臥室的梳裝亳玻璃下。我離開貝許德斯加登時還私下帶了一張出來，那上面開着道：</p>
<p>一，除此臥室之外，一概禁止吸烟。</p>
<p>二，來賓請勿與僕役交談，或為具遞帶任何包裹信件之類。</p>
<p>三，在談話中或晋謁時，概須用「元首」二字，不得種以「希特勒君」或其他稱謂。</p>
<p>四，女客不得濃裝，指甲着色允在禁止之例。</p>
<p>五，進餐時，請於聞得鐘聲後二分鐘內齊集膳堂。元首未就坐或引退時，來賓請勿入席或離去。</p>
<p>六，領袖入室時應卽起立。</p>
<p>七，非經元首通知，來賓務請於每晚十一時安息。</p>
<p>八，來賓務請居於賓館部分，凡住宅內室，辦公廳，或政治警察局等處，概須止步。</p>
<p>九，離去貝許德斯加登時，來寶切勿將來訪事情，告知外入，元首所作之談話，　須嚴守秘密。如洩漏元首之私生活情况者，將受嚴厲處分。</p>
<p>希特勒的身體早就很不康健，雖然他對於親信也從不提起此事。全世界知道這事的祇有少數幾個人，像著名的德國心臟咽喉病專家饒柏勒教授，他曾為希特勒開過三决刀；柏林名醫，希特勒的終身侍醫腦爾教授；亨萊·史汀美士教授，和其他幾位由巴黎或紐的而來的專家。他們都能為希特勒嚴守秘密。</p>
<p>有一個時期，希特勒的心臟使他非常不好。當他軍國大事叢集待理的時候，他却要休息幾天，一些事情也不去做。他所患的為心臟疲乏症，腦兩教授所認為最頭痛的，就是叫他休息而他並不遵命，於是只有為他不時注射藥物。</p>
<p>希特勒的牙醫生，柏林專家哈登斯汀，如簪他治牙，感覺非常痛苦。在拔牙時稍有損傷，他便像小孩子般的叫喊起來。然而他還是拒絕用瓦斯，他怕懼用麻醉劑，如非遇到嚴重的開刃，他纔破例接受。他口內共有八顆假牙齒，和幾處用金子鑲嵌的地方。</p>
<p>希特勒為掩護耳目起，僱有二個替身。他們的名姓祇有僱用他們的秘密警察喊得出來。在私室中還認得出他們的眞面目，然而一經穿上了希特勒般的衣服，又經過專家的化裝之後，在二十碼之遙，就休想辨認得出來。</p>
<p>一星期中有四個女侍輪班整理希特勒的臥室。不過每决男侍弗萊士總是在塲監視着。臥室之中陳飾簡單，一隻大鐵床，一隻小半桌，靠窗一隻大桌子，一隻沙發，一隻寫字台，再過去便是一架書櫉。隔壁有一個小的梳裝室。</p>
<p>床上舖着一層褐色的大被單，上面繡着一個大的卐字。希特勒所穿的寢衣，在他所有的衣服中，要算最美麗動人的了。那是棕色緞子所做，袖口和襟作深棕色。口袋上有一個紅地黑色的卐字。還有一件厚的綢衫也是同樣的顏色。靠床一面的桌子上，常放着鉛筆和寫字紙，用過的紙頭每天早晨由希特勒或弗萊士撕去，有一天，我止在整理房閒的時候，看見地板上字紙簍旁，有一張團縐的紙。我趁弗萊士沒有注意的時候，拾起來朝袋中一塞。我為好奇心動，要想看看希特勒在睡不穩的夜閒，究竟在紙上寫些什麼。</p>
<p>我在沒有返自己臥室之前，也不拿出來看。這紙頭上畫着的，看上去好像某一地區的草圖。上面潦草得很的，和一些也沒有意義的，有幾個字的樣子。我，一些也看不出來這裹面在講些什麽。便把它放在抽屜中聊作紀念而已。</p>
<p>兩天之後，剛巧碰着每月到警察局去報到的日子。凡是在貝許德斯加登當差的都要在每月指定的日子到警察局去聽候查詢一决。如果希特勒到於僕役有一些指摘的地方，不問屑到怎樣，準要受到罰薪，或不准出屋一個月的處分。</p>
<p>我因自問沒有做錯過事，所以站在警官之前心中很覺坦白。他把報告上每一項都仔細看到了，然後，很高興的說；「小姐，你的報告很好」。</p>
<p>我笑着謝謝他，於是他又和順地說，「你心上覺得有過不去的事情麼？也有舍利朋（總管）所沒有注意到的事情麼」？</p>
<p>我不覺發怔着的朝他看。但我眞想不起來有什麼事情，就把我所想的對他說了。於是他勃然的問我道：</p>
<p>「小姐，你在元首臥室中所拿的一張紙片到那裹去了」？</p>
<p>這是他們做着的一個圈套。那張紙是有心放在地板上的。我就辯說，我以為那是卽要銷毀的廢紙片。我自己知道這話是不得自圓其說的。那警官就叫我回去，等在房中聽候發落。我一個人坐在室中非常恐懼。</p>
<p>晚上，舍利朋差人來叫我去聽吩咐。我總算幸運得很，祇罰薪三個月，不准出屋一個月。這因為我從前一向沒有過失，成績甚好。此外我想，我和舍利朋及副管家愛爾薩平時情感都很好的緣故。當然我受到一頓訓責，以後如果再犯，定要送到染中營去了。（完）</p>

<p>自公共租界英商上海電車公司全體工人於二十日實行罷工後、英商中國汽車公司工人、亦因前所提勞資互惠條的、公司延不答復、卽於前日（二十四日）繼當車工人而罷工、致界內公共交通事業、完全停頓、詎料在公共租界兩處罷工聲中、而法租界之公共汽車及無軌電車、昨晨又因要求改善待遇而以罷工聞矣、兩租界當局及各界有關人士、雖均欲出任調處、惟癥結尚多、恐非片言所能解決、茲將昨日各方所得詳情、分誌於决、</p>
<h3 id="c34">法租界之罷工情形 <a href="#c34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>昨據記者探悉、法租界公共汽車及有軌無軌電車工友、於昨晨開始罷工後、卽於午時召集全體會議、除通過向資方提出條件十六項外、並推舉職員、至於向公司交涉之代表、亦可於今日推出、並將卽日向資方開始談判、又據某工友聲稱、罷工原因、除工友因生活程度增高、要求公司當局提高待遇外、又因邇來工友與總管理處因職務關係常起衝突、致屢被處罰所致、</p>
<p>有軌電車　照常行駛</p>
<p>法租界公共汽車行駛全綫、祗有兩路、卽二十一路自打浦橋至外灘、二十二路自徐家滙至外灘、無軌電車亦祗有十七路斜橋至大世界、—八路打浦橋至大世界兩錢、昨晨全部停駛、有軌電車雖照常行駛、惟車輛减少、路綫亦大為縮短、按法租界共有無軌電車四十輛、有軌電車六十輛、公共汽車六十三輛、且每一輛車上、駐有越捕二三人、隨車監視保護、以防意外事件發生、</p>
<p>徐家匯發　現物溜彈</p>
<p>自昨晨公共汽車與無軌電車全部停駛後、有軌電車本亦捲入漩渦、嗣以法當局與捕房之努力設法、使各路有軌電車、在上午九·十時决第恢復行駛、勉強維持法租界內一綫交通、惟車輛及行駛路綫均為縮短與减少、計一路三輛、二路五輛、七路的六輛、十路兩輛、昨日下午四時許、二路車行駛至徐家匯時、突起轟然一聲、有一手溜彈在路旁爆發、幸未傷人、因此行駛徐家匯之車輛、至福開森路卽掉頭、而十路車亦祇由霞飛路口駛呂班路底掉頭、並不直駛　家灣、</p>
<p>工廠附近　戒備嚴密</p>
<p>法租界公董局警務處及捕房方面、於昨日獲悉、公共汽車及無軌電車工人罷工消息後、卽派遺越捕及警務人員多名、分赴呂班路康悌路口車廠四周公共汽車及電車係同一車廠及呂班路徐家滙路口工務處附近嚴密戒備、法捕房砲車、亦全部出動、在各重要馬路往來梭巡、</p>
<p>卅餘工人　開會被捕</p>
<p>聞昨日上午十一時、康悌路法商電車公司附近、有電車公司賣票、司機及機器間銅匠間等工人三十餘人企圖在公司附近集合開會、當為捕房獲悉、派出大批巡捕、將是項開會工人加以逮捕、現正由政治部究詢中、</p>
<p>西報所載　罷工原因</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、法商電車公司華籍工友、今（廿五日）晨宣布總罷工、致該公司經營之法租界電車　公共汽車、皆未駛出、而兩租界之公共載送交通、遂告全部停頓、法商電車公司之罷工、惟緊隨公共租界之電取與公共汽車兩公司工潮而起、</p>
<p>少數電車　仍予維持</p>
<p>法商電車公司雖遇工潮、但今晨仍派出少數電車、維持館馬路與霞飛路主綫業務、每隔十分鐘、卽有一車駛過、由電車公司中西高級查票員駕駛、每車皆有武裝巡捕一名保護以防罷工者滋擾、一般人現以法租界電車工人之工潮、或將擴展至工廠及大商店為慮、</p>
<p>大批華人　示威行動</p>
<p>法商電車公司經理斐夫萊今晨稱、呂班路車廠外、有不相識之華人的二三百人、舉行示威運動、並張貼鼓動罷工之招貼、嗣經巡捕驅散、同時、英商電車與公共汽車兩公司工友五千人罷工、今日仍陷慍局、蓋未聞勞資雙方復作磋商也、、英商公共汽車公司車廠在義軍防區內之康腦脫路、聞義軍不因共係英商而置不顧、且巳允在肇事時予警方以全力協助、又又聞義兵咋（廿四日）曾襄助巡捕將罷工工人攔出車廠、今日則不斷探　車廠情形、</p>
<h3 id="c35">公共汽車　昨無接觸 <a href="#c35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>公共租界英商公共汽車工人、因要求改善待遇、廿三日與公司當局談判決裂、於前日（廿四）宣告罷工後、勞方曾開會決定準備提出四項先決條件、要求公司當局接受、俾得先行復工、然後解決廿三條、唯昨日勞方以此後先決條件、或須作部份之修正、故昨日並未向公司當局用書面或口頭提出、勞資雙方、亦米有任何接觸、究於何日開始談判、或由第三者出任調停、經記者向各方探詢、均無肯定之消息、</p>
<p>生活威脅　迫而出此</p>
<p>據勞方某負責者告記者稱、「此次罷工、引起社會各方之不安與不便、深表遺憾、唯公司對工友所提之合理求、不能一貫採用敷衍手段、工友迫於生活之威脅、掙扎於饑餓綫上、不得不採取此項促請公司覺悟之行動、吾人決不作損害公司任何財產及於社會治安有碍之激烈行為、全體工友、均抱沉着堅靱態度、靜候公司之覺悟、俾容納合理之要求、吾人全力爭取者厥為生活之獲得確切保障以便在溫飽之環境下、得以安心工作而已、」又昨日康腦晚路公司四週、仍由捕房加派大批探捕妥為戒備、全日未有任何意外事件發生、一切秩序照常、</p>

<p>顛沛流離</p>
<p>輾轉溝壑的幾千萬受難的同胞、我們後方的人們對於征募寒衣、實在是義不容辭的、允其在這上海租界上居住的人民、要特別負起這個責任、試看在全國各地區中有那個地方能像上海這樣的安全、有那一個人民能有上海人這樣的享受、我們都是炎黃子孫、我們為什麽祗顧到個人的安全享受呢、如果上海市民還是祇顧自私自利、再不用熱忱來策動、成績占全國第一的</p>
<p>征募寒衣</p>
<p>代金運動、怎樣對得起國家、怎樣對得起民族、怎樣對得起將士和受難同胞呢、要是上海的市民對這次徵募寒衣裳代金運動、不論力量大小、不論男女老幼、都能盡力的應募、至少可以减少些、</p>
<p>良心譴責</p>
<p>略盡國民的天職、希望上海的同胞、無論農工商學各界、都應自動的策動、踴躍徵募、各就本身的物力財力人力貢獻於政府、</p>

<p>罷工巳達六日之公共租界電車工潮、因勞資雙方、談判復工條件、未能接近、而陷於優持、昨日工友方面、並未派代表前往公司談判、現勞方仍堅持資方須先接受四項先決條件、始允復工、但資方截至昨止、尚無讓步之表示、故雙方之優局、一時不易打開、又據另一消息、公共租界工部局工業科、於熟察勞資雙方之情形後、將出任調解之責、</p>

<p>— 楊中一</p>
<p>儒曰聖，釋曰佛，儒曰賢釋曰菩薩，其名異，其誼同也。儒有小儒大儒之辯，佛有小乘大乘之別。小乘者聲聞緣覺，亦稱、乘凡夫。大乘則過去，現在，未來諸佛菩蔭，皆從此十方同準，三世無改之唯一教理，共依正行，由以了妄卽眞，轉迷成悟，從因趣果，越凡入聖，而至大覺如來地。二乘聲緣之所修習者，四諦十二因緣。大乘菩薩之道，則六度梵行也。梵語波羅密多，經典每省作波羅密。華言，姚棄羅什舊譯為「度」，李唐玄奘新譯到彼岸」實含二誼，謂菩薩之大行　究竟切自行化他之事，日事究竟，乘此大行，能山生死之此岸，達到湼槃之彼岸，曰到彼岸。因此大行，能度諸法之廣遠，日度無極。波羅密有六種：一檀那，二尸羅，二羼提，四毘黎耶，五禪那，六般若，故稱六度。</p>
<p>最初曰檀　那波羅密</p>
<p>檀那，華言布施，謂以福利與人而無慳嫉；卽是利益衆生之慈善事業與大悲心，能救他人之苦，謂之悲心，佛菩蔬悲心廣大，故謂大悲，略說四種：</p>
<p>其一財施</p>
<p>什譯智度論云：「布施心相應善思，是名為檀，檀有三種，持戒自檢，不侵一切衆生財物，是行財施」。法苑論云：「財施有五種一至心施；二，信心施；三，隨時施；四自手施；五如法施。所不應施，復有五事：一，非理求財，不以施人，物不淨故；二，酒及毒物不以施人，亂衆生故；三，置　　網，不以施人，惱衆生故；五，音樂女色，不以施人，壞淨心故」。北凉曇無　譯優婆　戒經云：「無財之人，自說無財，是義不然，何以故？一切水草，人無不有，雖是國王，不必能施，雖是貧窮，非不能施。</p>
<p>案無不能布施之人，而有不可布施之物。不義之財，本非吾有也，烏得施人？至害衛生之食，傷物命之器，擾治安之行，敗德度之物，皆在禁施之例，大悲心量，周至若是。</p>
<p>孟子曰：「惻隱之心，仁之端也」。佛之布施，卽孔孟之仁乎！仁者，相人偶之誼；蓋能對於人類，而盡其彼此相與關係輛助之道，則所謂仁也。故論語云：夫仁者，己欲立而立人，己欲違而達人，能近取醫，可謂仁之方也己。</p>
<p>其二力施</p>
<p>擾婆塞戒經又云：「天下之人，誰貧無身，如其有身，見他作福，身應，往助亦名施主，亦得福報」。</p>
<p>案此卽人力不足，我力所能者，則有相助之誼，故名力施；所謂有財者出財，有力者出力，其施一也。成人之美，手援天下，其儒者之力施乎！昔者孔子之父叔梁紇，抉偪陽城門，而出將陷之師，正力施之一例。</p>
<p>其三法施</p>
<p>智度論又云：「能種種說法，令其聞悟，名為法施」。阿浮陀達摩經此云未曾有，亦云希法，十二部經之一，頗能扼財法兩施之耍，云「布施飲食，濟一日之命。施珍寶財物，濟一世之乏，增益繫縛。說法教化，名為法施，能全衆生出世問道一。提波羅菩薩大丈夫論，北凉道諦譯，允能辯財法兩施之味，云「財施除衆生身苦，為其作無盡錢財，為得身樂，為衆生所愛，為愚人所愛，能與現樂。法施除衆生心苦，為能無盡智，為得心樂為世間所敬，為智者所愛，能與湼槃之樂」。</p>
<p>案法施為儒佛兩教最所注重。諺云一世勸以口，百世勸以書，著述立言，其儒家之法施乎！如來之五教三時，因緣說法，卽孔子之因材而篤，有教無類，孟子之樂育英才，成德達材也。孔子之馴馴然善誘人，學不厭而教不倦，教不倦，仁也。是故誨人不倦，孔子之法施也。辨王霸，說仁義，孟子之法施也。</p>
<p>四無畏施</p>
<p>智度論又云：「衆生畏死，恃戒不害，名無畏施一。</p>
<p>案朝聞道，夕死可矣，道之不可得而聞也如是。若復信道不篤，知不能　，虛負此身，與未聞等。故宏誓願力，須由無畏精神赴之。孔子之當仁不讓，孟子之予豈好辯，此孔孟之無畏施也。至於孔曰殺身成仁，孟曰捨生取義，惟其義盡所以仁至，文文山曰，讀聖賢書，所學何事，大矣哉驚天動地，可泣可歌之事，其皆聖賢佛菩薩之無畏施乎！</p>

<p>紗市趨堅、漲風至厲、此因投機買風劇烈之故、一般業外者靜默已久、鑒於現銷稍起吸收拉提更強、一方面利於多方之傳說極盛、據市塲言、證劵幫金子幫小銀號大概利用銀根鬆弛、一致出動、向紗市塲紛粉迤進雙馬、以作踢皮球交易矣、因之漲力甚熾、不過由某豐代廠方在此地日中拋出雙馬廠單的幾千包、然一陣在風驟雨、勢難遏制、越買越高、至於香港幫銷場、已轉滯耳、</p>
<p>現紗晨開、二十支雙馬在此謠諑紛亂中、人氣堅挺、首盤卽漲十餘元、為一千〇五十八元、稍盤即刻步步上升、雖有大戶賣出、然市情依然前進、一直漲至一千〇九十元、但客帮需要因高後已轉呆滯、然檳面上買氣仍屬熱烈不堪、中途獲利雖有了結、市價一回卽升、查半日閒成交三千八百四十五包、同行交易占三分之二以上、行情二十支雙馬跳五十八元、茲將各幫口買去之額量分列如左、</p>

<p>現棉情形、亦轉良好、此因紗市步升、人心隨之振作、不過廠方華商採探較為活動、惟外廠需要依然平平耳、新棉稍有來源、</p>
<p>另訊、外棉市價、紐約棉市、晨初殊形活躍、因現貨交易之良好、及華爾街之購買、結果收盤價較之上日漲三四磅音、印度昨日連同預測漲半羅比餘、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、咋又因棉紗之漲價、加之市上棉花存底不豐、故市殊為俏俐、允以長纖維者為最、但二十支之原棉、亦因之活躍也、</p>

<p>晨初以倫敦大條近遠各跌零六二五、紐約銀價仍平、倫敦生金呆定、匯兌英對美對滬均平、美對英長二五、對滬升五分、中央掛牌各匯如舊、銀行現貨賣價、英金三辦士四八四三七五、美匯五元三一二五、較之前收、英緊零一五六二五、美則告平、開後市况沉靜、缺少成交、迨匯豐掛牌揭曉勿動、白銀平衡稅揭曉跌〇·二五、此後華行忽來售予英行現貨英金三辦士四八四三七五、及半辦士、是以英金遂告回平、嗣雖華商扒進若干、但華銀行與外行尚肯供塞、斯時情况缺乏變化、計投機商扒入外行九月期美匯五元三一二五、兼華行吐予外行十月期美匯亦為五元三一二五、如是迨至午刻、匯豐突吃進同行十月份美匯五元三一二五、市况穩中略軟、結果收盤英金仍為三辦士四八四三七五、美匯五元三一二五、十月期英金三辦士四六八七五、美匯五元二八一二五、結果比上日英均微緊零一五六二五、美則俱無榮辱、午後週三無市、</p>
<p>香港二十五日（週三）電、今晨匯市開盤平定、英日申各匯、均無榮辱、（由匯現貨昨收為四百二十六元、）美匯現貨回鬆零六二五、為二十二元八一二五、（昨收為二十二元七五）十一時三十分平穩、美匯現貨回緊零六二五、為二十二元七五、其餘不動、下午週三無市、</p>

<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、九時半掛小十元、但此後雖金市跌後回漲、然掛牌並未掛大、致結果大同行改懸六百三十元、新同行與上價相仿、收進减低三十元光景、</p>

<p>小麥昨日堅靜如常、日廠與華廠進胃一致怠懈良以洋麥有大額運到、各廠原料似不貪取、而售主以供源缺乏、一時終靴貶小、結果日廠仍以原盤收進二三千包、華廠祇有一二百包、價亦仍為二十四元六角半至六角、</p>
<h3 id="c83">雜糧黃豆微升 <a href="#c83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>黃豆為雜糧之主幹、故其他各糧之升降、不脫黃豆漲落之牽制、近日黃豆各方銷塲不絕、但少新刺激、致處於徘徊瞻顧之局、咋交易略呈熱鬧、行情較前市稍砌二三角、計成交桑園豆四百包、價為三十三元七角、南京豆二百包、價為三十三元、太倉豆幾十包、價為三十六元五角、安慶豆三百包、價為三十三元六角至九角、常州牛皮黃四車、價為三十四元五角、及崇明沙黃五十包、價為三十二元、昨有豆子一千三百五十五包運往香港、</p>
<h3 id="c84">證劵債市人氣恍惚 <a href="#c84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨市因本埠略有謠傳、使漲風頓受挫折、多頭出　較湧、午前平　、午後瀉落三五角、越南事件波驕雲詭、已使投機家取靜觀態、度、本埠謠言無從證實、故人心不無恍惚、浮多脫手、仍為投資者吸收而去、趨勢或將環境變化多端、而暫趨於盤旋、縱有回小亦必有限、昨日上午生大新華聯益及潤德先後均有買進、鴻大多頭漸有吐出、久豐亦賣出為多、其他各幫大都出多進少、市價平平而已、午後鴻大繼續出籠聯益稍有賣出、震康仁昌及怡泰亦求售、市價頓轉疲勢、丙種敲破六元、乙種退進八元、信孚同康鼎康聯和等買進、小收盤、但收盤後又稍轉堅、市價結果一律回跌三四角至五角半、成交總數共計一百萬元左右、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交家庭工業社股四十股、價為八十二元五角、</p>
<p>昨日衆業股市動盪不定、開盤甚穩、開後大批獲利了結、頓將市况壓低、嗣因補空關係、價格稍形回上、結果較前收仍小不少、</p>
<p>倫敦二十四日（週二）電、今日中國外債及遠東英商各公司掛牌行市仍告平滯、祇麥加利銀行股稍呈起色、行情上升三先令九便士、價為六鎊十一先令三便士、其餘不動、</p>

<p>甜杏如北山杏、龍王帽、中杏等、首批新貨均巳有到、惟以價較昂、尚乏成交、聞龍王帽叫三百二十元、中杏叫二百五六十元、行方還價離譜、迄未接近、</p>
<h3 id="c89">海南圓肉續漲甚勁 <a href="#c89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>桂圓行號方面、存貨早巳告斷、產區如興化·泉州·安海·同安。漳州等之新貨、均巳登塲、興化泉州安海均以輸運未通、暫乏來申可能、他若漳州同安本可轉鼓浪嶼運申、然以帆船尚未正式開放、亦乏運到、現在僅海南所產之挂元肉、來數較多、價亦較為平直、最低會到一百二十四五元、旋升至一百三十四五元、近以開價轉緊、昨市叉升十餘元云、</p>

<p>黑瓜子近以到存均稀、產價且升、故回漲甚勁、昨徐魁子開至九十八元、相城子九十四元、均升十元之譜、明光子八十四元、升七元、</p>

<h3 id="c94">不是犧牲 <a href="#c94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>— 陳銘</p>
<p>本月十七日本報載有嚴正君寫的「妻的犧牲」一篇，大意是他的夫人是上海一個有名的女子中學畢業，品學兼優，常時他們打算在婚後一同星出晚歸，各入盡各人　國家，社會的責任，不料婚後有了孩子…他的夫人便不得不拋棄書本，拋棄理想，輾轉在菜塲上，廚房裏，臥屋中，變為一個管家婦。這是一個巨大的犧牲，使得他常感到慚愧得無地自容！但是她呢却熱心地教育起孩子們來，彷彿把她的希望寄托在他們的身上。所以雖然她的大妹從陝北來信說「姊姊並非庸碌之士，相反地你比我要強上幾倍。奈何現在你埋在家庭的瑣事中了！……（這封信又使他慚愧了一次），她却笑笑地不說什麼。最後他很感慨的說：「像妻一樣作了犧牲的，又不知有多少哩！」</p>
<p>嚴君的感慨，我是很同情的。我的妻以前是杭州一個大學的學生，擅長辯才，又富於組織力，常常在課外活動裏擔任重要的地位，因之師長們都許她將來成為一個社會上領導人物。不料八一三戰起，她不能赴杭讀書，我又因職業上的關係，隨時有離開上海的可能，故此經變方同意後，就於二十六年冬季舉行婚禮。現在行將三年，巳經有一個孩子，第二倘又快來臨了。不要說這三年來她未曾參加一次任何團體活動，就是她滔滔的辯才，也因為日久荒疏，不如以前的流利了。瞻望她的前途，恐怕也決不會再參加社會活動：因為她與在整個的心靈已經完全被家庭和孩子佔據就是偶爾我邀她出去有電影，她總要絮絮叨叨惦記着家事和孩子的冷熱，而不能安心地享受。像這樣埋沒在家與孩子中的人，自然提不到去作什麽社會上「領導人物」。如果用嚴君的話來說，就是「作了犧牲」了。</p>
<p>然而我和我的妻却不認為這是犧牲。我們以為一個女子在家裏料理家政和照顧兒女，也是一種事業，需要相當的學識，正和一個男子在社會上服務一樣。如果提倡本位救國的話，那些治家有方的中婦實在也盡了她們的責任，應該予以表揚。諺云：優秀的國民出在優秀的家庭。這不是已說明作妻的對於家庭，社會是何等的軍要！有許多賢明的主婦能够使她的家庭充溢着愉快的氣氛，一方面她能使她的丈夫從工作後的疲乏中迅速恢復，或使他從事業上的失望，受氣沮　中軍新振作；另一方面她能使他們的兒女受有改良的家教，從小就培養出正確的人生觀，獲得必要的知識，成為將來一個個健全的國民。所以她們雖然沒有直接到社會上服務，其實却負有推動社會和改造社會的力量。她們的功勞不是表現在外面的，然而她們的存在却是國家所不可缺少的！</p>
<p>起初我也會為我妻抑鬱在家庭這麽一個小圈子裏，感覺不安，好像是因為我而害了她的事業和偉大的前途。但是現在我的思想改變了，我發現她的事業就是治理家庭，她的前途就是教育子女！這句話對於主張女子參政的人，也許不能入耳，不過依我觀察，我妻對於孩子和家庭的專心致志，並不是受環境的脅迫，也不僅是責任觀念而已，乃是完全出乎自願的行爲，是天性的表現！她對於現在的生活，一絲沒有認為是犧牲，也不懣怨，反之，却很快樂地擔任了這許多煩重的新工作。我妻的熊度，誠然不能代表全體婦女，但我相信嚴君的夫人一定是她的同志，而持有同樣態度的婦女，也一定還有許多！</p>
<p>最後，我希望嚴君和一切與嚴君有同感的人，不必再感覺慚愧。你們應該盡力協助你們的夫人，誠懇地和衷共濟，用分工合作的原理，使你們的家庭都成為理想家庭。去作應作的事。我以為這才是男女平權的眞諦，這才是現在我們的國家，社會所需要於我們的！</p>

<p>— 賤葉</p>
<p>故鄉又一再被炸了，傳來的消息是家屋遭了殃。</p>
<p>想起年近九十的祖父，半夜裏睡不着，披起長衫，在黑暗中，望着星和月。</p>
<p>月是圓圓的，耳邊聽見隔壁一家慶祝着團圓，喔，團圓的中秋節，是今天。</p>
<p>祖父的蒼老的形影，閃爍在星問。嘴邊拖着疏長的髯鬚，晶瑩的眼睛射着淡泊和善的光，眺望着四周；（蓋是尋找沉陷在黑暗中的孩子罷？）</p>
<p>撐起全家吃着的網的是祖父，使我們長大起來的是祖父。祖父是嚴正的，然而祖父並不刻薄；祖父有一個強健的身體，這是由於日常生活有着規律的緣故。</p>
<p>你知道祖父的一生，就是在於有「正常」二字，他有正常的行動，他有正常的生活。他節儉，他決不浪費，他對任何一紙一物，都不加拋棄，「利用廢物」是他的一種習慣，也是他的一種修養。</p>
<p>然而他的優點，却並不止於這些。</p>
<p>你想一個生在前淸咸豐年間的人，他並沒有跟後二代的孩子有一些隔膜，這該是一件多麼難得的事情！他每天看報，他堅持着信仰——和四萬七千萬人相同的信仰。張着模糊的老花眼，他在期望着勝利，祖國的最後的勝利！</p>
<p>可是，故鄉迺炸了，祖父的音訊杳然。</p>
<p>望着星和月，星光淡泊得看不見，月是破碎的。</p>

<p>— 程小靑著</p>
<p>第八章　捉住了兩個人</p>
<p>我不再聽得那人說話，但聽得他的皮鞋脚步加速地前進。我仍和他背道而行，但我的步子和他的步子的速度恰正成了反比例。一回兒他的脚聲已聽不見了。我估量他已轉了灣。我突然旋轉身來，幾乎跟小李撞個滿懷，嚇得他倒退一步。我忙搖搖手，暗示他不要聲張，便用着闊大而輕捷的脚步，一直竄到那轉折處。我立卽把身子蹲下，探頭瞧向五五六號的門口。趙伯雄也正僂着身子，把耳朶貼在房門上傾聽。他顯然也已懷疑房間裏的朋友不是他的眞朋友。他的身子站直了，略略沉吟了一下，他的右手忽而迅速地仲進他的衣袋裏去。我從轉折處望過去，雖有近十碼的距離，那邊的光綫也不很亮，但我仍瞧得見他的右手從衣袋裏拔出來時，已拿着一支黑色的手槍！他又站直了考量了一下，隨卽將左手握在房門鈕上。他的手握住了門鈕以後，好像停留了兩三秒鐘，重又猶豫不決。其實這不是停留，他分明在那裏緩綏旋動，企圖不讓裏面的霍桑發覺他在門外面的行動，以便突如其來地撲進去。</p>
<p>這是個緊張關頭，我當然不能再靜伏了！我放開脚步，直奔過去。我的手槍早也離了衣袋。等我奔到五五六號門口時，趙伯雄一把門開了一半，他的左脚跨進了門口，右脚還在門外，他的執槍的右手，却停留在將舉未舉的尷尬姿態上。我忙舉耙手槍，抵住在他背後的脊骨部份，嘴唇同時發出一種低沉而有力的命令。</p>
<p>「別動手！」</p>
<p>這時忽有一串格格的笑聲，直刺我的耳朶。那笑聲祗增加了我的興奮。原來發笑的是雀桑。霍桑正站在門口的裏面，因着趙伯雄的個子高闊，把雀桑掩避着，故而我不曾瞧見。　（一一八）</p>

<h3 id="c97">血液療病 <a href="#c97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>— 史旅</p>
<p>現在差不多每個人都曉得，對於遭不幸者和病人的大出血後，最有效的療法是輸血。輸血就是在一個經渦嚴格檢查過（尤其是血型）的健康的陌生人身上，取出一定量的血液，注射到病人體內。</p>
<p>但是最近又發現變親的血液，可以治愈患有某幾種病的病孩，而且有顯著而優美的效果，在某種情形下，還可挽救生命於垂死之時。費拉博士（Dr．Fiala）在不久以前發表他試騐的結果。首先他對於正患着危險的猩紅熱併發症——如肺炎和腦膜炎等——的病孩</p>
<p>（他們的生命正在死神威脅之下），施行雙親血液療法；他用他們父親的或母親的少量血液，行肌肉下注射，而不久，一部分居然完全恢復建康，卽在全體病例中，沒有一個發生可怕的併發症。因此醫院遂採用為小兒科猩紅熱的特效藥。</p>
<p>此外，對於沒有多大危險的小兒痳疹，用同樣方法，亦可達到目的。當一個小孩，受他的兄弟或姊妹的麻疹傳染時，只需注射少許雙親的血液卽可免除。這在許多病例中——如衰弱的孩子同時還生着別種的病時——最有用處。事實上人們祇要生過一次　疹，血液中卽永遠存在一種抗體：但是有特別效力的變親的血液，究竟憑籍那一點足以治愈猩紅熱和麻疹，在今日還不能完全曉得。</p>

<h3 id="c99">從丑肚脚說到賈多才孫盛武（上） <a href="#c99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>— 梅花館主</p>
<p>「生，旦，净，末，丑」是戲班裏的主要角色，丑角的地位雖然比較輕微，但是他的用塲却非常廣大，除掉幾齣光上生旦的「份河灣武家坡……」以外，其餘的不論文戲武戲，大戲小戲，老戲新戲，可說都有小丑的份兒，戲班裹有句行話叫做「無丑不成戲」，從這句行話，可以知道丑角在京戲裹所處的地位並不輕微，而且是很重要的。</p>
<p>書本子上說：丑字是「　」字的省寫；而當初評劇名家林屋山人，則說丑就是「醜」的意義。記得他生前，會經發表過下面這麼一段文字：</p>
<p>「丑者醜也，飾丑角者，以不醜血醜為上乘，醜而不醜為中乘，旣醜而醜為下乘。」</p>
<p>當時袁二公子抱存，很贊成這個詮釋，並且還自詡本人　弄丑劇，足當「不醜而醜」的條件咧。（公子擅崑戈，二黃戲以小丑劇著名，飾審頭刺湯之湯裱禙瀟灑冷雋，一時無儔，聞係學自名丑克秀山者）。區區對於已故的丑脚，誰好誰壞，一概不提；現在還在紅氍毺上討生活的幾位，不妨談上一談。</p>
<p>據我個人的視覺來判斷，蕭長華不失是個小丑的典型人物；他在台上表演，不但光是氣度好，而且還有着一副天生好嗓子，淸脆瀏亮，父甜又有味兒，聽了眞能使人過癮。他的戲以方巾丑為第一，（如羣英會之蔣幹，一捧雪之湯勤，）連陞店的店家，請醫的醫生，靑石山的王半仙，甘露寺的喬喜，女起解的崇公道，烏盆計的張別古，亦都是他成名的佳作。他現在年紀雖老，精神還是好的很，演起戲來，居然還是十餘年前的作風。慈瑞全亦是成名匕久的老脚色，他扮演「雙鈴記」的貨郎，「能仁寺」的賽西施，「女起解」的崇公道，「珠簾寨」的老軍，「法門寺」的賈貴，都很有精彩，可惜演方巾丑缺少一些雅氣，他之所以不能和蕭長華駢武齊轍，就是為了這個緣故。馬富祿雖然是僩紅角兒，但是他的玩藝，實在不敢恭維，油腔滑調，一無是處，倒是反串「得意緣」的老旦，還成個樣兒。茹富蕙是蕭長華的徒弟，玩藝着實不壞；法門寺的賈貴；烏盆計的張別古：一捧雪的湯勤，羣英會的蔣幹，一落大派，純粹是蕭老板的作風，吃虧在個兒太矮了一些。曹二庚東西很好，口齒亦很淸晰，程硯秋始終很器重他；他老子就是大名鼎鼎的崑戈名家曹心泉，晚年著述很多，對於崑曲確有相當貢獻，可惜現在匕成了故人了。此外我還賞識二人，一個是彩且能手賈多才，一個是　起之秀孫盛武。</p>

<p>— 夢白</p>
<p>星星劇社最近假辣斐劇塲第一次演出，一共有三個戲。</p>
<p>第一個戲是吳天編的「被迫害的」，在此時此地的上海，演出確是靴能可貴的。立里的阿毛和花櫻的翠花相當成功，不過有些地方台詞不大熟，墨易演陳三眞像一個老年人，可是身體還可以抬起一點來，律萍的大金子和古月的余嘴都實足表演出上海的白相人的風格，幾個高潮都很不錯。</p>
<p>第二個是「瑪琳」，立里的石好仁十足表現出了他的個性，羅卡的賈經理，化裝得不大像。凌萍的吳璜，傑飛的萬方茫，夢茜的背毅，莫易的王品三，都相當的成功，美美的瑪</p>
<p>第三個是喜劇「未婚夫妻」，以四個演員，來處理一幕喜劇，是一件很困難的了，他們却演得非常成功，情節非常緊湊，始終抓住了覜衆的心理。齊紫演得最好，秋壑的房東也很逼眞，烟萍和鵬飛都平平。</p>
<p>其他如燈光，效果和化裝都相當好，都是其他業餘劇社所及不上的，允其是在裝。總之該社第一次公演能有這樣好的成績，都是社員平日努力而來的，希望該社以後能繼續努力它的前途一定是很光明的。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Guìhuá Army Begins Aiding Vietnam: Large-Scale Offensive Against Invading Japanese Troops; Japanese Army Counterattacks Chinese Forces; Strength of Japanese Forces Invading Vietnam Diminishes; France Declares Franco-Japanese Hanoi Accord Null and Void <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Guìlín: Frontline sources from the Chinese side report that this morning, the Chinese army began aiding Vietnamese forces, launching a large-scale offensive against the Japanese army's transportation lines in the rear of Vietnam. It is said that the Chinese army is only threatening the Japanese rear and has not entered Vietnamese territory. It is also reported that the Japanese army has been forced to launch a counterattack against the Chinese forces, thereby weakening their forces invading Vietnam. It is said that the Chinese army is attacking Japanese forces in the areas of Lóngzhōu and Zhènnánkūn and their transportation lines to Vietnam. Chinese sources also report that the Japanese army has heavily reinforced its forces in order to intensify its attack on Vietnam and cope with the threat from the Chinese army in the rear. (United Press, 25th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: A semi-official Japanese source states that the Japanese Southern China Army Command has issued a public announcement stating that, according to the terms of the Franco-Japanese agreement, the Japanese army is scheduled to land in Haiphong today. We anticipate that this action will be carried out smoothly under the terms of the agreement. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: According to unconfirmed reports, Chinese forces in southwestern Guì province will attack the rear of Japanese troops that have entered Vietnam. Here, news of French resistance is welcomed. Newspapers are saying that this is a time for struggle, not protest, and that the Chinese army should not be satisfied with defending the border but should cross into Vietnam and provide assistance to the French army. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: The National Government convened a meeting yesterday to discuss the situation in Vietnam. All important personnel attended, listening to reports from Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui and Minister of Military Administration He Yingqin regarding the latest developments in Vietnam. Afterwards, it was announced that the government had decided to proceed with all actions in accordance with established policies and plans. The Yunnan provincial authorities are currently busy organizing the province's militia. Every two or three county chiefs must jointly form a detachment responsible for maintaining local order and security in peacetime and assisting the regular army in combat should the war extend to the local area. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<p>Hanoi: After the Japanese army launched another fierce offensive, news from the front lines ceased this morning. According to official announcements, "The Japanese army has violated the Franco-Japanese agreement, and Vietnam finds this difficult to tolerate." Another official communiqué stated, "Japanese Southern China forces have engaged in offensive actions on the northern border, and the Vietnamese authorities vow to resist with force." However, the communiqué also stated that Vietnam will still fully implement the agreement reached last Sunday allowing a certain number of Japanese troops to enter Vietnam via Haiphong. At the same time, official sources stated that they had received assurances from Tokyo that the Japanese side had ordered the Southern China forces to cease their offensive. However, with the communications cut off from Hanoi and Lạng Sơn, it is impossible to ascertain today whether the Japanese army has indeed ceased its attacks. According to the last reports from the front lines before communications were cut off, the Japanese army was attempting to occupy the important railway route, and fierce fighting was underway in the Lạng Sơn area. Officials also stated that yesterday, the Japanese army's offensive was aimed at advancing along the key transportation routes surrounding Lạng Sơn. Although facing the French army's fortresses head-on, the Japanese army utilized the cover of darkness and did indeed cross the French defenses, advancing a certain distance. It is reported that the towns of Kexi on the Lạng Sơn-Cao Bằng road and the Luoping area along the Lạng Sơn-Mengkai road have been occupied by the Japanese army. (United Press, 25th)</p>
<p>Haiphong: French officials declare that, because the Japanese army continues to violate the Franco-Japanese Hanoi agreement, attempting to forcefully enter Vietnamese territory, the French side has deemed the agreement null and void. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<p>Hong Kong: Following the Japanese invasion of Vietnam, the situation in Vietnam has become tense. Naval authorities in Hong Kong issued orders on the morning of the 25th for all British ships to temporarily cease sailing to Vietnam. Telegrams between Hong Kong and Vietnam are still functioning today. (25th dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: An English newspaper recently advised Vietnam to continue resisting the Japanese Southern China forces and appealed to Britain and the United States to take swift action to halt Japan's southward advance. The newspaper stated, "The Far Eastern Munich agreement established in Hanoi has resulted in Vietnamese troops under the leadership of French officers resisting the Japanese army, which is truly an unexpected development. The Japanese believed that honest Frenchmen might allow them to enter Vietnam and become conquerors, but now they have encountered armed resistance from the French garrison. China is now advising Vietnam to do its utmost to resist Japan, knowing that the truth of 'seeking life in death' has been demonstrated by China's actions over the past three years. The crisis in the Pacific has reached an extremely dangerous point, and all related countries must unite against Japan. However, although the situation is dangerous, it is not beyond rescue. What is needed now is swift action without hesitation to restrain Japan." (United Press, 25th)</p>
<p>French Troops in Lạng Sơn Firmly Defend the Chén Di Fortress, Resisting the Andō Unit</p>
<p>Hong Kong: All ships sailing between Vietnam and Guangzhou Bay have been ordered to cease sailing. It is reported that the situation in Vietnam has completely come to a standstill. Chinese military sources say that Andō, the commander of the Japanese Southern China Army directing the invasion of Vietnam, has received increased assistance from several Japanese military leaders in Tokyo and Nanjing. News arriving here from Hanoi says that 10,000 French troops south of Lạng Sơn and Đồng Đăng are digging trenches to defend solid positions, resisting troops under Andō. Chinese sources added this evening that Major General Nishihara of the Japanese-Vietnam military delegation has so far failed in his efforts to dissuade Andō from invading Vietnam. General Andō has instead gained the support of Japanese military leaders from across China. (International Dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>Hanoi: The Japanese army in Southern China has evidently disregarded the Franco-Japanese agreement signed here on Sunday. Yesterday afternoon, it renewed its large-scale attack on the Vietnamese border. According to French sources, the Japanese army's offensive is again focused on the area surrounding Lạng Sơn, an important railway town where the Japanese suffered heavy losses when they were repelled the day before yesterday. Unconfirmed reports received here say that French troops captured 200 Japanese soldiers on Monday. The official French casualty list currently includes only 20 deaths. A hospital train that arrived here on Monday night carried 100 wounded soldiers. French troops in Vietnam yesterday were on alert, awaiting the second step of the Japanese army. There were several small skirmishes yesterday morning near Lạng Sơn along the Guangxi border, but the major fighting only resumed in the afternoon. Nishihara, the head of the Japanese military delegation, left here for Chinese territory, reportedly planning to persuade the Guangzhou army to stop attacking Vietnam. There has been no news since Nishihara left, and it is believed that he has arrived in Guangzhou or Hainan Island. After the French government renounced the Hanoi agreement concluded last Sunday, it announced last night that the entire situation depends on whether Major General Nishihara succeeds in persuading the Guangzhou army to leave Vietnam. Japanese transport ships in Haiphong began lowering their boats yesterday morning in preparation for landing troops, but then raised the boats again and sailed out of Haiphong in an unknown direction. A third air raid alert was issued in Hanoi yesterday at noon, but no Japanese planes appeared. Yesterday, posters were found on the walls here, telling residents without important business to evacuate quickly. The Japanese side notified France that it would launch a major offensive at dawn and begin bombing Haiphong. However, the situation on the border between Vietnam and Guangxi was quiet yesterday morning. French and Japanese troops were dug in facing each other. Border sources say that French troops have recaptured Đồng Đăng. Annamese troops offered strong resistance to the Japanese army. Observers returning from the border say that the Japanese attack on Lạng Sơn suffered extremely heavy losses. The cannons of the strong French fortresses in the Lạng Sơn area caused heavy casualties to the Japanese army. They said that the roadsides were piled with Japanese soldiers' corpses. Because the Japanese army was unable to bury these bodies, it cut off both hands of each corpse so that they could be identified by fingerprints later. French troops at each stronghold have now been ordered not to open fire until the Japanese army does so first. Twelve Japanese bombers flew over Haiphong this morning in a show of force but did not drop bombs. French anti-aircraft guns did not fire on them. Schools here are now closed, and citizens are evacuating as advised by the newspapers. The Chinese consul has also advised Chinese residents to gradually evacuate. (United Press, 25th)</p>
<p>Haiphong: French and Japanese troops in northern Vietnam exchanged small-scale rifle and machine gun fire yesterday afternoon, but otherwise the situation appeared outwardly calm. It is widely believed that Japanese representative Nishihara is now heading to Hainan Island to meet with Andō, the commander of the Japanese Southern China Army, today. Andō is dissatisfied with the recently concluded Hanoi agreement and plans to launch a large-scale offensive against Vietnam by land, sea, and air, while Nishihara plans to dissuade him. At the same time, the French side is preparing everything to resist any Japanese actions outside the scope of the agreement. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<p>Japanese Southern China Army Invades Vietnam: France Lodges Protest with Japan</p>
<p>Vichy: The French government protested to Japan yesterday, criticizing it for allowing the Japanese Southern China Army to invade Vietnam. The French protest formally declared that Japan should bear responsibility for the fighting on the Vietnamese border. It is said that the protest accused Japan of violating the Hanoi agreement, because the agreement only permitted Japanese troops to enter Vietnam via Haiphong, not via Guangxi. At the same time, the Chinese embassy announced that the Chinese government had delivered a written protest to the French government, protesting the content of the Hanoi agreement. The Chinese protest stated, "This agreement allows the Japanese army to wage war against China, which violates all of France's treaty obligations and is contrary to the spirit of French diplomatic neutrality and good neighborliness." A spokesman for the Chinese embassy said that China had repeatedly denied that Chinese troops had crossed the border before the Franco-Japanese agreement was signed on Sunday. (United Press, 25th)</p>
<p>Vichy: Regarding the conflict between French and Japanese forces in northern Vietnam, an official statement was recently issued here, refuting the remarks of Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman Suma. It stated that, according to the Franco-Japanese agreement of the 22nd of this month, the Japanese air force may use three airfields in northern Vietnam, and the ground troops protecting these airfields must land in Haiphong. In addition, the agreement clearly stipulates that if the Japanese army makes other movements, it must obtain the prior consent of the French side. The above points were communicated by the Japanese negotiators to the commander of the Japanese army on the Guangxi border in China. Unexpectedly, some units of the Japanese army there violated the agreement and marched into northern Vietnam. French outposts immediately opened fire and resisted. The French ambassador to Japan is currently in talks with the Japanese Foreign Ministry to discuss a solution. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<p>Hong Kong: According to late news from Hanoi received here this morning, the Japanese army in Guangzhou attempted to invade Vietnam from the Lạng Sơn area on Tuesday afternoon. News from Hanoi also said that the fighting was scheduled to stop at noon on Sunday, but after the Japanese army reinforced the Lạng Sơn area, it continued its offensive in the afternoon. Another report said that Vietnamese troops captured 200 Japanese soldiers. The French side admitted that French casualties numbered 20 killed and wounded. Those close to the commander of the Japanese army in Guangzhou have described a conflict that occurred today between the Japanese army and diplomatic personnel in Tokyo. It is said that the commander of the Japanese Southern China Army claimed that the move to enter Vietnam was his own idea and insisted that his Japanese troops stationed in Guì must enter Vietnam. The Guangzhou Japanese army's wireless telegraph station was the first to "point out" that the Vietnamese authorities were allowing goods to be transported to Chongqing and providing assistance to Chongqing. Tokyo's adoption of the policy of entering Vietnam was due to this. (International News Service, 25th)</p>
<p>French Ambassador to the United States Says He Will Invite Chinese Troops to Enter Vietnam to Provide Assistance</p>
<p>Washington: The French Ambassador to the United States, Henry Haye, issued a statement last night stating that France has decided to resist any actions by the Japanese army that exceed the scope of the Franco-Japanese Vietnam agreement by all possible means. The Japanese army has violated the Franco-Japanese agreement and attacked key points in Vietnam. Our determination to defend Vietnam in accordance with the signed agreement remains unchanged. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<p>Washington: French Ambassador to Washington Henry Haye declared last night that French troops in Vietnam will resist the Japanese invasion and will invite Chinese troops to enter Vietnam to assist French troops in fighting against Japan. He said that French troops will resist the Japanese offensive regardless of the disparity in numbers. He expressed hope that Chinese troops could assist French troops, "as promised in the repeated official statements issued by Chongqing last month." The French ambassador said that he had not yet received reports to confirm that Chinese troops had entered Vietnam. Mr. Haye also said that he was confident that the United States understood and sympathized with France's position in Vietnam. He said that rumors that the United States had previously approved France's concessions to Japan in the Hanoi agreement were not true. He said that the US government was kept informed of the negotiations at the time, and the agreement concluded in Hanoi on Sunday has already been effectively cancelled due to the Japanese side's violation of the terms of the agreement. The French ambassador said that if France were in the same position as before the European war, it would not make any concessions to Japan. He said, "However, under these circumstances, we must deal with reality." (United Press, 25th)</p>

<h3 id="e2">The Once Again Tumultuous Vietnam Problem <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>The Franco-Japanese-Vietnamese negotiations, which have been in turmoil for three months, were concluded with the signing of an agreement at the last moment before the expiration of the Japanese ultimatum, for the sake of building a "new order in East Asia" and "granting certain military conveniences to the Japanese army." As a result, Vietnam not only failed to preserve the integrity of its sovereignty and territory, but also failed to enjoy even a moment of temporary peace. For three days and nights, the tragic calamity of war has continued to engulf the Vietnamese border, forcing the French and Vietnamese authorities, after succumbing, to reiterate their determination to resist. The entire eastern hemisphere has also been stimulated by this strange and abnormal change, and feels even more strongly that it cannot stand idly by in the face of the crisis in the Far East. It is difficult to say with certainty at this point what the end result of this development will be, but the previous humiliation of the French and Vietnamese is all the more proof of a great misjudgment. To seek complete preservation through submission is already a bitter state of mind, and if one can be fortunate enough to obtain complete preservation, then even if one suffers the blame of being unjust and cowardly, one can still use the excuse of complete preservation as a way to justify oneself. But now, humiliation has been added without safety, and one cannot but try to cheer oneself up in the midst of bitterness, and re-drum up the remaining courage of a once-despondent spirit. Their situation is certainly worthy of sympathy, but also greatly regrettable.</p>
<p>The mistake of the French and Vietnamese lies in their gullibility: first, they mistakenly believed that the Japanese side would definitely keep its word, and that once the treaty was concluded, they could still maintain the rights outside the treaty; second, they fundamentally did not recognize the Japanese side's habitual use of dual or even multiple diplomacy, and believed that the parties involved in the negotiations could represent the entire other side. They did not expect that the ink of the signed treaty would not be dry before the clash of arms arose on the border. Faithlessness and breach of treaty, disregard for morality, is indeed what today's aggressors excel at, but the breach of a treaty occurring at the same time as the signing of the treaty is still unheard of in the past. Judging from Germany and Italy's acceptance of France's surrender this summer, once the treaty was concluded, it was done and finished, and there was no repeated quarreling or insatiable demands. They, as victorious countries, did not go too far against the defeated countries, so what Japan is doing to the French and Vietnamese now is truly difficult to imagine with common sense. The world often equates Germany and Italy with Japan, and lists them together as aggressive countries, but looking at them now, how vastly different are they from each other? The term aggression is certainly not enough to encompass the significant differences between them, which is what the world should deeply recognize.</p>
<p>The future of Vietnam hinges not on the French and Vietnamese, but on the Japanese; not on the Vichy and Hanoi authorities, but on the French and Vietnamese military and civilians; not on the relationship between the French and Vietnamese and Japan, but on the movements of the powers surrounding the Vietnam problem. The resurgence of this Vietnamese-Japanese dispute stems from the Japanese side violating the limits allowed by the treaty, not because the French and Vietnamese authorities fundamentally regretted their decision. If the Japanese side could rein in its horses at the precipice and obey the law, taking what is permitted by the treaty as the starting point for further actions, then it might not be impossible to obtain its desired rights and interests in a more gentle manner, and the French and Vietnamese authorities, fearing the harm of a cold alliance, would not be difficult to take action. Therefore, it is said that it does not depend on the French and Vietnamese, but on the Japanese. At this moment, the Vichy and Hanoi authorities are at a crossroads of war and peace, and the world should not hesitate to encourage them, hoping that they will become stronger, and make up for their mistakes. However, judging from their current situation, if Germany and Italy do not strongly support them, they will certainly not be able to resolutely reject the humiliation of Vietnam amidst the thorns and thistles. Then, instead of focusing on the French and Vietnamese authorities, it is better to place hope in the loyal and brave military and civilians of the French and Vietnamese. Only these military and civilians can correct their past mistakes and strive for a new future for defeated France. Therefore, it is said that it does not depend on the French and Vietnamese authorities, but on the French and Vietnamese military and civilians. This time, the French and Vietnamese blamed the meager assistance of Britain and the United States for their submission, which only proves that they initially lacked the determination to resist. The task of defending Vietnam is indeed not something that the French and Vietnamese alone can accomplish today. China has already shown the world its determination. As for whether the statement of Britain and the United States that they will not allow the status quo of Vietnam to change can be effective, it depends only on whether they can immediately take positive and effective action in addition to the joint defense measures under consideration. Therefore, it is said that it does not depend on the French and Vietnamese and Japan, but on the relevant powers. This is not to underestimate the French and Vietnamese authorities, but their recent announcements only make people more pessimistic about their future. French Ambassador to the United States Henry Haye did make the statement yesterday that the Vietnamese-Japanese agreement has been cancelled due to the Japanese side's breach of the agreement. This voice from an empty valley is valuable, but unfortunately it still lacks strong evidence to prove that it is indeed true.</p>
<p>The two sets of wars in the Far East and Europe have always been conducted separately under different natures and scopes. Since the deterioration of the Vietnam dispute, the world's perception has been that these two sets of wars are likely to merge into one with Vietnam as the opportunity, and the Axis power Italy also attaches great importance to Japan's invasion of Vietnam, saying that it is a major threat to Britain. In fact, so far, Japan's diplomatic stance is still aloof from the belligerent countries of the European war, without any left or right or partiality, and only seeking to expand its own rights and interests. Japan's deep cultivation of power in Southeast Asia is indeed a concern for Britain and the United States, but how is it fortunate for Germany and Italy? Rather than seeing this as Japan's response to the Axis countries, it is better to say that it intends to take the initiative before Germany and Italy have secured a definite victory, in order to prevent Germany and Italy from seizing a share of the defeated countries' territories in the South Pacific. On the other hand, it also shows that the past concessions made by Britain and the United States to Japan in the hope of gaining its assistance were all in vain. Having learned this lesson, there is no need to worry too much in the future, and only harm oneself. The European war and the Far Eastern crisis have always belonged to two different natures and two different categories. The Vietnam problem is certainly enough to affect the powers, and the more the dispute expands, the wider and deeper the involvement will be, but how can it affect the advance and retreat of the belligerent countries on both sides of Europe? Moreover, it will not cause the confluence of the two sets of wars in Europe and Asia, which is what can be asserted at this moment.</p>
<h3 id="e3">England and America Watch the Far Eastern Situation, Will Take Joint Action, Send Fleets to Reinforce Singapore, America Intensifies the Embargo Against Japan <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Washington - Confidence has increased here last night that England and America are considering taking joint action to "stop" Japan's deep advance into Southeast Asia. Unofficial but highly reliable sources say that both England and America will not allow Japan to invade French Vietnam, and Japan's threats to Singapore and the Dutch East Indies will also not be ignored. These sources say that the Roosevelt government will regard Japan's invasion of Vietnam as the most serious act of undermining the status quo in the Far East since Japan launched the war in Shanghai. As of last night, although England and America have not yet indicated what action they will take immediately, authoritative sources believe that the government will probably not make any more protests. It is said that the executive authorities have stopped all empty talk, and will take practical actions from now on. According to reliable sources, Britain is preparing to send a strong fleet to reinforce the Far East, especially Singapore. Indications here are that British first-class warships do not need to participate fully in the war in the British mainland for the time being. These sources also say that according to reliable sources, Britain believes it can send several teams of Mediterranean naval forces to the Far East. Another unconfirmed report says that the United States may send a part of the main force of the Hawaiian navy to reinforce the US fleet that will go to Singapore. At the same time, Republican Representative Rogers told reporters that she believes that the United States is currently negotiating with Britain so that the United States can lease other British naval bases in the Far East in addition to the Singapore naval port. She said that although she cannot predict what kind of plan the executive authorities will take, she firmly believes that the decision to sell destroyers to Britain has already indicated that the two countries may establish another agreement of the same nature. (United Press Agency, 25th)</p>
<p>Washington - Secretary of State Hull told reporters that the United States is now waiting for more accurate information about the development of the Vietnam issue before taking special steps to deal with Japan's activities. Hull was unwilling to discuss whether the United States could assist the French army in Vietnam in resisting the war, and whether the United States had already or would protest against Japan. Hull also stated that he had not heard any official news that a part of the US fleet currently stationed in Hawaii would be transferred to the Atlantic Ocean. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<p>Washington - Reliable sources here said today that it is inevitable that the US will intensify its ban on the transportation of military supplies to Japan. They also predicted that President Roosevelt will soon order that various oils, as well as scrap iron, or even copper, must be subject to export license control. This export license system will allow the National Defense Committee to transport these materials to Britain, but not to Japan. Secretary of State Hull told the press today that State Department officials had a meeting, and what they discussed was the situation in the Far East. Hull said, "We are now focusing on all developments in the Pacific." (International News Agency, 25th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - A spokesman for the Japanese Foreign Ministry admitted today that Japanese government leaders are expecting the United States to retaliate against Japan's invasion of Vietnam. However, the spokesman said that this kind of action will not have any impact on Japan's policy. (International News Agency, 25th)</p>
<p>Rumor: Germany and Japan Will Form an Alliance to Confront the Joint Defense Line of Britain and America</p>
<p>Washington - Reliable sources say that Japan and Germany have agreed in principle to form a "defensive alliance" to counter the joint front of Britain and the United States in the Pacific and Atlantic. The purpose of this alliance, as suggested by the German side, is to try to divert the attention of the United States in all aspects, so that it cannot devote all its efforts to helping Britain. Officials here refused to comment immediately on the news of the German-Japanese alliance. This news was transmitted to Washington a few hours after President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull studied the official report on Japan's invasion of Vietnam in the White House. Hull went to the White House after dinner last night and discussed the situation in the Far East with President Roosevelt for a long time. This shows that the US government has paid close attention to Japan's actions in the Far East. However, the US government did not take any action last night, and Washington officials privately admitted that Japan's actions in the Far East have made the United States feel very uneasy. It is heard that the agreement in principle reached by Japan and Germany on the alliance was approved by the Royal Conference in Tokyo on September 19. As soon as the Japanese Privy Council officially approves it, the German-Japanese alliance will be announced in Tokyo. It is also heard that Germany has taken on the task of mediating the rapprochement between the Soviet Union and Japan, or will promote the conclusion of a mutual non-aggression treaty between the Soviet Union and Japan, so that Japan can act freely in southern Asia. Recently, Thailand sent an important delegation to Japan, which made some people believe that the German-Japanese alliance may enable Japan and Thailand to cooperate militarily in southern Asia. This action will be easier to achieve due to Japan's attack on Vietnam, and this action is also a serious threat to Singapore and a help to Germany's policy of dividing the British Empire. It is generally believed that if Britain and the United States establish cooperation in the Pacific to stop Japan's southward advance, then the rumored German-Japanese alliance can be realized. If Britain and the United States announce an agreement to deal with the Far East, such as the US fleet using the Singapore naval base, then Japan will abandon its policy of not joining the European war. Japan will then continue its southward process and eventually attack the source of raw materials for Britain and the United States. At that time, Germany will also intensify its attacks on Britain and create political turmoil in South America to prevent Britain and the United States from retaliating against Japan. This kind of action by Germany will divert the attention of the United States to the Pacific and Europe. It is heard that the rumored German-Japanese defensive alliance has been strongly promoted in Tokyo by Stadmayer, a confidant representative of German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop. (United Press Agency, 25th)</p>
<p>Berlin - German authoritative sources recently did not express acknowledgement of the news that Germany and Japan have reached an agreement in principle on a defensive alliance, saying, "We cannot deny that we know nothing." (United Press Agency, 25th)</p>
<p>Although Washington government officials have received news about the German-Japanese alliance, they do not know whether this news is accurate. They do not doubt the diplomatic cooperation between Germany and Japan, but they believe that this news is a test balloon to test the attitudes of various countries in the world, especially the attitude of the United States. It is generally believed that this agreement will make Japan openly go to war with Britain and increase the tension between the United States and Japan. (United Press Agency, 25th)</p>

<p>Tunxi - A reporter met a general from the reclaimed areas of southern Jiangsu in the front line of a certain place. According to the conversation, the current situation in the reclaimed areas of southern Jiangsu is as follows: Although many cities in southern Jiangsu have fallen into the hands of the Japanese, the Japanese forces still cannot leave the city gates even a single step. In recent years, China has made leapfrog progress in politics, and the unification of the party, government, and army has been thoroughly achieved. Moreover, in this vast reclaimed area, not only is the Chinese political power still deeply rooted, but also the judicial power can still be executed. Now, in order to strengthen the political power at the grassroots level, the Jiangnan Administrative Office is actively training the Baojia chiefs, and the county magistrates of various counties also go out on patrol from time to time to summon the township chiefs and the masses to give speeches. The general mood is still very excited, and the military power is also growing stronger. Recently, it has controlled the Beijing-Shanghai Railway and the Shanghai-Hangzhou National Highway. Therefore, the suspension of traffic and the overturning of vehicles are often heard. (24th telegram)</p>

The Japanese army at the foot of the mountain has very strict restrictions on tourists on the mountain. Even if missionaries from third countries want to enter the mountain, they are often prevented. However, the Chinese guerrillas around Mount Lu are very active, and gunshots are heard all night long. Those who live in Guling are always startled several times a night. (25th telegram)</p>

<p>Chongqing - Recently, the Central Government has made two major decisions regarding the National Assembly and the National Political Council:</p>
<p>National Assembly</p>
<p>Regarding the National Assembly, the Central Committee's 157th Standing Committee made the following resolutions: The National Assembly was originally scheduled to be convened on November 12 this year, and the government has instructed the National Assembly Election General Office to continue to investigate the elections that have not yet been completed in some areas and have not yet been reported to the office, and to find ways to complete various procedures. Recently, according to the report of the office, although the investigation procedures have been largely completed, transportation in various places has been greatly inconvenienced due to the impact of the war. If the meeting is convened according to the original deadline, there will be major difficulties. After careful consideration, the Council believes that the convening date of the National Assembly should be determined separately. All unfinished election matters should still be handled actively by the Election General Office under the responsibility of the government. All matters related to the construction of the venue and the reception of representatives should also be quickly formulated by the Election General Office to establish a National Assembly Preparatory Committee to be responsible for presiding over the meeting. The Preparatory Committee should be established within October of this year.</p>
<p>National Political Council</p>
<p>Regarding the National Political Council, the Central Committee's 158th Standing Committee made the following two resolutions:</p>
<p>(1) The term of the National Political Council expires in October of this year, and it has been more than two years since the retrospective examination. The National Political Council has made great contributions to the unity of the whole country and the promotion of the work of resisting the war and building the country. It is appropriate to continue to convene it to comply with the provisions of the guidelines for resisting the war and building the country. Now, with reference to the experience of the past two years and the expectations of people from all walks of life, the method of producing councilors will be improved, the number of councilors will be appropriately increased, and the powers of the National Political Council and the resident committee will be expanded. The chairmanship system will be changed to a central seat system, with the aim of promoting the collection of opinions and broadening the benefits of thinking.</p>
<p>(2) The second National Political Council should complete all production procedures in November of the 29th year of the Republic of China in accordance with the revised National Political Council Organization Regulations, and wait for the convening date.</p>

<h3 id="e10">A Turning Point in Anglo-French Relations: The Battle for Dakar Continues; British Fleet Continues Fierce Bombardment of the Coast; Free French Forces Repelled Six Times in Landing Attempts <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>VICHY: French newspapers generally regard the British naval attack on the French-held port of Dakar in West Africa as a turning point in the history of Anglo-French relations. "Le Journal de Paris" declared that de Gaulle had guaranteed that he would never attack France, but now he has broken his word and relied on the British navy to massacre his compatriots, a clear act of treason. "Le Débats" also condemned the attack on Dakar as a "mad crime." (Haitong Telegram, 25th)</p>
<p>LONDON: It is reported that the admiral leading the British fleet attacking Dakar issued an ultimatum demanding the port's surrender. After being rejected, the battle for Dakar is continuing fiercely. The Vichy government admits that the French submarine "Persée" has been sunk by the British, but claims that General de Gaulle's troops were repelled four times while attempting to land at Rufisque and twice at Dakar. London claimed today that while actions to prevent French Equatorial Africa from falling into German hands are continuing, there is no doubt that French Equatorial Africa will ultimately be under the Free French flag, thanks to General de Gaulle's spirit, determination, and the patriotism of the military and civilians. According to a communiqué issued by the Free French Forces headquarters, General de Gaulle decided to attack Dakar only when Germans and Italians invaded West Africa and controlled air bases there. The attacking forces include the army, navy, and air force. The Free French navy escorts the French forces, while the British navy provides supplementary protection against possible German attacks. The Dakar authorities bear the responsibility for initiating hostilities, as they opened fire on French ships while the French forces were attempting a peaceful landing, resulting in several deaths and injuries among the crew. To avoid French fighting against French, General de Gaulle withdrew his forces to a distant anchorage. However, the Dakar authorities continued to bombard the French forces, prompting the British ships to take action. Since the armistice, French West Africa has shown various signs and actions supporting the continued resistance initiated by General de Gaulle. (Reuters Telegram, 25th)</p>
<p>VICHY: An official communiqué recently announced that the British fleet bombarded the French West African port of Dakar from 9:30 AM to 10:30 AM yesterday, while British aircraft bombed the French battleship "Richelieu" (which was previously heavily damaged by British warships in Oran, North Africa, and has not yet been repaired), but missed. French coastal artillery and air force returned fire. A British cruiser was hit by a large bomb. In the battle, 120 French soldiers and sailors were killed, and 138 were injured. Among the civilians, 62 were killed, and 225 were injured. The British fleet resumed bombardment at 1:00 PM, lasting for 30 minutes. The number of casualties is not yet known, but it must be higher than in the morning. (Havas Telegram, 25th)</p>
<p>LONDON: News arriving here this morning states that in the narrow harbor of Dakar, which can only perform broadside firing maneuvers, more than a dozen British warships exchanged fire with seven French warships last night. Two British battleships, four cruisers, and several auxiliary ships repeatedly fired broadsides at the French fleet and the port of Dakar after the French West African governor rejected the second ultimatum demanding surrender. According to official sources here, the attempt by General de Gaulle's "Free French Forces" to land was abandoned when the Dakar garrison opened fire on de Gaulle's troops. However, the official also indicated that the British navy will soon control the situation and will be able to send sufficient troops to land and fight the Dakar garrison, estimated at 5,000 men. British authorities here say that the French warships in the port of Dakar have been heavily damaged, and the shore has also been severely bombarded by British naval guns. (International Telegram, 25th)</p>
<p>LONDON: It is widely believed here that the British attack on the port of Dakar is a prelude to a large-scale strategic offensive against Germany. Therefore, the British action is not only intended to seize control of French Africa from the Vichy government. The diplomatic community is confident that if General de Gaulle's first attack on Dakar is successful, he will drive straight along the North African coast and achieve the goal of obtaining a base for operations against Germany. This plan was conceived by former French Prime Minister Paul Reynaud, but the plan was abandoned when Pétain took power. Since the governors of the French colonies succumbed to Pétain, Reynaud's plan to attack from North Africa failed. However, de Gaulle's followers are convinced that the French military and civilians are willing to continue the northern war. (Editor's Note: A large portion of the news has been deleted here.) The greatest feature of the British war is that even with cruel German air raids, Britain can still send its troops to fight in various places. Therefore, Britain has thwarted Hitler's main goal, as the Germans have failed to prevent the British from sending reinforcements to key points in Africa and the Mediterranean. Britain has already sent a large number of reinforcements, and the victory of the Axis powers in the African war is by no means certain. Another result of the expansion of de Gaulle's front may be to increase pressure on Spain to stay out of the war and not succumb to the temptation of the Axis powers.

<p>French Statement on the Progress of the Battle: One French Submarine Sunk</p>
<p>VICHY: A communiqué from the French Naval Department announced the sinking of a French submarine in Dakar, stating that on the 23rd of this month, a British fleet consisting of two battleships, cruisers, destroyers, and several transport ships arrived off the port of Dakar. De Gaulle issued an ultimatum demanding the surrender of the city's French authorities. Upon rejection, the British fleet opened fire on Dakar. During the exchange of fire, the French submarine "Persée" bravely attacked a British cruiser but was sunk, with most of the crew killed. However, the British cruiser was also hit. De Gaulle commanded his troops to attempt landings four times at Rufisque and twice at Dakar, but all were repelled. Facing this setback, the British fleet sent a second ultimatum at 1:30 PM, stating that if the city was not surrendered before 6:00 PM on the 24th, they would have to attack Dakar with the British army, destroy the port's fortifications, and occupy it. The French governor replied, "France has entrusted Dakar to me, and I will defend Dakar to the end." At this point, the battle resumed. (Reuters Telegram, 25th)</p>
<p>Note: The sunken French submarine "Persée" had a surface displacement of 1,379 tons and a submerged displacement of 2,060 tons, with a crew of 63 men. It was equipped with 11 torpedo tubes, one 4-inch gun, one 3.7-inch anti-aircraft gun, and one machine gun. Most of the crew escaped. (Haitong Telegram, 15th)</p>
<p>French Aircraft Bomb Gibraltar: Retaliatory Measures Against Britain</p>
<p>VICHY: An official announcement declared that French aircraft today heavily bombed Gibraltar, turning the entire strait into a "sea of flames." It is widely believed that the French ordered the bombing of Gibraltar as a "retaliatory measure" for the British attack on the port of Dakar. (International News Agency Telegram, 25th)</p>
<p>GIBRALTAR: A communiqué issued here states that more than 20 French-style aircraft flew to Gibraltar on Tuesday and dropped over a hundred bombs, at least one of which was shot down. The explosions killed four people and injured several others. Houses and roads were also damaged by the bombs. Three small fires broke out and were quickly extinguished. Several bombs exploded in the neutral zone separating Gibraltar from La Línea, Spain. (Reuters Telegram, 25th)</p>
<p>VICHY: According to a French government communiqué, in retaliation for the British bombardment of the port of Dakar, the French Air Force bombed the port of Gibraltar yesterday afternoon from 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM, dropping 45 tons of bombs on the armory and seaport, hitting one ship and starting fires in various locations. British anti-aircraft guns fired fiercely, but the French aircraft returned safely. (Haitong Telegram, 25th)</p>
<p>MADRID: A report from Algeciras states that a British fleet, including one cruiser, four destroyers, and two submarines, sailed through the Strait of Gibraltar and headed towards the Atlantic Ocean. It is expected that the British fleet is heading to attack French colonies in Africa. (Haitong Telegram, 25th)</p>
<p>U.S. Authorities Closely Monitor the Development of the Battle for Dakar</p>
<p>WASHINGTON: Officials here are closely monitoring the development of the war in Dakar, as the scope of the war is closer to the Western Hemisphere than any previous war. However, officials emphasize that the war does not directly affect the United States for the time being. The military significance of Dakar has been the subject of much discussion here in recent months, as Dakar is located on the opposite side of the Atlantic Ocean from South America, only 1,600 nautical miles from Brazil. Observers believe that French military leader General de Gaulle and his ally Britain will not allow Dakar to fall into German hands and become a base for attacks on British shipping. Since the blockade of the Mediterranean, American shipping to West Africa has increased considerably. Therefore, it is generally believed that the U.S. fleet may request the use of Freetown, a British naval base 550 miles south of Dakar. It is also noteworthy that the United States established a consulate in Dakar in August, which the press considers to be the establishment of an American "outpost." (United Press Telegram, 25th)</p>
<p>WASHINGTON: Diplomatic and military circles here revealed today that the German high command secretly planned to use Dakar as a submarine base and establish an air station and radio station there to maintain contact with the German espionage network in South America in order to gain ultimate control of the Western Hemisphere. This plan was underway before the British fleet attacked the capital of this French colony. The British plan to occupy the port is therefore the reason. It is reported that the Germans attempted to open a commercial air route to disguise a military aircraft base in Dakar. The Germans had already dispatched 500 technicians to Dakar to expand the existing air base, build a large radio station, and transform the old French naval base. Once the naval base is completed, German submarines will be able to navigate the South Atlantic at will. Germany also hoped to use the name of the former "Air France" to open regular mail and passenger flights between Paris, Dakar, and Natal. American military circles are concerned about Germany's plan to make Dakar a strong German base, pointing out that Dakar is located on the protruding point of Africa, closest to the eastward protruding point of Brazil in South America. Dakar is only 2,000 miles from Pernambuco, which is within the range of a strong navy. (International Telegram, 25th)</p>
<h3 id="e11">French Naval Chief Issues Proclamation: Vehemently Condemns Britain <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>VICHY: Following the British fleet's shelling of the French West African port of Dakar, French Naval Minister Darlan issued a proclamation to the nation's naval officers and men, vehemently condemning the British action. It stated: "Since the British fleet attacked our country's fleet off Oran in North Africa, British Prime Minister Churchill gave a speech on July 14th of this year, declaring that he would no longer attack French warships. At the same time, our country's dismissed general, de Gaulle, also solemnly made a promise, declaring that he would never use the troops under his command to attack our country. Unexpectedly, the British, with the help of de Gaulle, are now everywhere attacking our country's colonies under the pretext of protecting them. As for the attack on our country's West African territory of Dakar, the inhabitants of that port are purely French and have not been threatened by any party. There is no need for Britain to overstep its bounds. The British are attempting to occupy Dakar, the key to the South Atlantic, purely for their own interests. In short, the British fleet first attacked our country's port of Oran and now invades the port of Dakar. They often mistreat our country's sailors who take refuge in Britain, which shows that the goal of this new act of aggression by Britain is to starve our people to death, bankrupt our country, and lead to the disintegration of our colonial empire. However, we have the determination to stop Britain's schemes. Our country's army, navy, and air force stationed in Africa have severely damaged and repelled the aggressors who attempted to land, and have taken various retaliatory measures. Our country's martyr, Joan of Arc, once said, 'Peace must be obtained on the bayonet.' How meaningful is this statement! At this time, the motherland hopes that the nation's naval officers and men will be loyal, courageous, and patriotic to defend our country's territories." (Havas Telegram, 20th)</p>

<p>LONDON: Dakar is located on the coast of West Africa, occupying a strategic position. It is a transportation hub with four airfields nearby. Dakar is also the starting point of the railway from the west coast to the Niger River in Central Africa. It also occupies an extremely important position in terms of telephone and telegraph communications. The German claim that Dakar is an undefended city is completely inaccurate, as can be seen from the fact that the port's coastal artillery has been constantly bombarding French and British ships.

<p>VICHY: The cabinet held a state council meeting today and immediately passed the bill proposed by Justice Minister Alibert, which advocated the establishment of a military tribunal to try the followers of dismissed General de Gaulle and a bill on food speculators. Alibert also gave an explanation, stating, "Yesterday, when our country's West African territory of Dakar was attacked, dismissed General de Gaulle participated in the incident. Regardless of how de Gaulle explains it, the people of the country should have fully understood that what this person is striving for is to alienate our country's overseas territories and cause the successive collapse of mainland France and its colonies. If anyone still thinks that this is the best way to show patriotism, then that person must undoubtedly be crazy. At this time, the government knows that there are quite a few of de Gaulle's followers scattered throughout our country. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a military tribunal to try the rebels. In addition, those merchants who speculate on various grains are also extremely sinful and should also be transferred to this military tribunal for interrogation as a warning."

<p>BERLIN: A spokesman for the German Foreign Ministry told foreign reporters yesterday that the talks between Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and Italian Foreign Minister Ciano in Rome will become the most glorious historical event in modern history. According to the spokesman, who accompanied Foreign Minister Ribbentrop to Rome, he refused to announce the content and results of the Rome talks, only stating that the basic outline of the Rome talks is as follows:</p>
<p>The Rome talks discussed various issues to subdue Britain. The content of these issues is completely contrary to what has been repeatedly explored around the world. Its content is completely based on the basic concept of the Axis powers, that is, no compromise. What was discussed was the operational strategy against Britain on various fronts. Based on these two basic concepts, the Axis powers are engaged in their political, military, and diplomatic activities. All events in the battle against Britain, large and small, have been carefully considered. Therefore, today's talks among the Axis powers are not limited to combat. They are also responsible for discussing the current war situation and the construction of a new order. The characteristics of the new order are to help European countries survive equally on the European continent and work together for Europe to obtain the necessities of survival. Therefore, Britain is not only an enemy of Germany and Italy, but also an enemy of countries that are fighting for the principles of the new order and encountering British obstruction. Britain today has become an enemy of young and powerful countries. The extent to which each country holds this view is an important question. As for what kind of courage the supporters of Britain will have to resist the new order is an interesting question in theory, but it is of no political significance. The spokesman continued to discuss the current situation in Egypt, stating that the responsible leaders of Egypt know that although the fighting has entered Egyptian territory, it is not a war against the Egyptian people, but a war against Britain, which is exploiting Egypt. The new government of Egypt is a symbol that Egypt has already understood this principle. Regarding the tone of German newspapers towards Greece, it is the tone that the German-Italian alliance should adopt. (Haitong Telegram, 25th)</p>

<h3 id="e16">Soviet Newspaper Comments on the Far East Situation: Great War Approaching the Pacific; Japanese Invasion of Vietnam Not Only Aimed at China; The Goal Is to Attack British, American, and Dutch Territories <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>MOSCOW: The Zhenli Bao published a commentary today entitled "Japan and Vietnam," stating, "Japanese newspapers claim that the Japanese invasion of Vietnam is only aimed at China. This kind of propaganda is nothing more than making people believe that Japan's plans at this stage have limited goals and do not strongly affect British and American interests. But in fact, Vietnam can not only be used as a base for operations against China, but also as a base camp for attacking the Dutch East Indies, the Philippines, and other British, American, and Dutch territories. American newspapers clearly stated that Vietnam is not Japan's main goal, as Japan's advance does not stop at Vietnam. Although Japan has not yet resolved the war against China, how can it invade Vietnam and incur economic retaliation from Britain and the United States? Therefore, the driving force behind the Japanese invasion of Vietnam is worthy of attention. We believe that the main reason for the Japanese invasion of Vietnam is due to the development of British and American cooperation. It is said that Britain is providing Singapore for American use. If so, then the scope of British and American cooperation has extended to the Pacific. In the war for supremacy in the Pacific, Japan must first expect resistance from the United States. Therefore, Japan has to consolidate its military position in future wars. In short, the Japanese invasion of Vietnam shows that the Pacific line of the Second Imperialist War is becoming active and the war is expanding." (Tass Telegram, 25th)</p>
<p>MOSCOW: The Red Star newspaper recently commented on the international situation, saying, "American Far East policy has become active and is enriching the actions of the American fleet. The work of dividing the French and Dutch legacies is underway, which has prompted the actions of the American fleet. The Japanese ruling class believes that Vietnam should immediately separate from France, and the Dutch East Indies should also separate from the Netherlands. Since the outbreak of the European War, Japan's southward advance and Japan's relations with Britain, the United States, Germany, and Italy have completely depended on the outcome of the Great War in England. This point is extremely clear. American observers believe that the British Navy can protect the Atlantic, and the United States can focus on strengthening its position in the Pacific. After the United States obtains Australia and Singapore, the balance of power in the Pacific will inevitably change again. American policy and British policy are gradually converging. Foreign observers believe that a military alliance between Britain and the United States may become a reality in a year. Therefore, the United States is preparing for war simultaneously in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans." (Tass Telegram, 25th)</p>

<p>ROME: Japanese Ambassador to Italy Eiji Amau met with Italian Foreign Minister Ciano yesterday for forty minutes. According to reports, they discussed the general international situation, and attention was paid to Japan's invasion of Vietnam. At the same time, the authoritative Italian newspaper "Roma" published a commentary on the Japanese invasion of Vietnam, stating that Japan has now posed a great threat to Singapore. The newspaper further stated, "Japan has now occupied the entire northern Vietnam in accordance with the agreement signed between the Vichy government and Japan. This fact cannot be concealed by even pro-British propaganda. Japan's occupation of northern Vietnam has shattered the various conspiracies that the British government and the infamous French exiles have maintained to this day. The United States also expressed dissatisfaction with Japan's occupation of northern Vietnam, as Vietnam has the world's best-located harbors, which is enough to cause problems for the military strength of Singapore."

<p>TOKYO: Japanese newspapers today ridiculed the U.S. Secretary of State's condemnation yesterday of Japan's aggression against Vietnam. Hochi Shimbun said, "Blaming Japan is as boring as the joint defense of Singapore by Britain and the United States." The Tokyo "Nichinichi Shimbun" said that the United States, Britain, and Australia are now embarking on an "invasion front" to take action against the Dutch East Indies and other countries in the southwestern Pacific. The newspaper stated that the purpose of this "invasion front" is to prevent Japan's southward advance and believes that Britain and the United States are now advancing their Far East policy with new strength. It also stated that Australia showed "friendliness" to Japan and exchanged ambassadors in July, but Australia still refuses to export its wool products to Japan. Therefore, we firmly believe that Australia is on the same Far East front as Britain and the United States. (United Press Telegram, 25th)</p>

According to the official report from the Japanese Consul-General in Singapore, he presented a strong protest to the Singapore Civil Affairs Department on September 22 against the British actions. The Civil Affairs Department explained that the search of Shinozaki's office was due to a misunderstanding, as it was mistakenly believed that the office was his private property. The seal on Shinozaki's safe deposit box has been removed as a result of the protest. (Reuters Telegram, 25th)</p>

Nazi planes, laden with bombs, raged like a roaring tide over the British capital throughout the night, dropping no fewer than hundreds of bombs and incendiary devices. British anti-aircraft guns fired almost continuously, attempting to create a terrifying curtain of fire. Reports of damage continued to arrive until this morning. Although most of the German bombs fell on the outskirts, the attackers seemed to concentrate on attacking the central London area. According to initial reports, the bombed areas in London have reached over forty districts. The exact extent of the damage is difficult to ascertain immediately, but it is said that the areas where bombs rained down suffered the most severe damage. This morning, London residents emerging from basements and tunnels saw countless houses and shops with collapsed walls and fallen roofs. Piles of broken glass and rubble littered the streets, and workers are trying to clear them. Many streets were closed to traffic due to the delayed detonation of several German bombs. Last night, the sky was as bright as day due to the countless incendiary and illuminating bombs dropped by German aircraft. The aircraft used more illuminating bombs last night than usual, apparently to illuminate their targets. The large fires caused by the incendiary bombs were either extinguished or brought under control by sunrise this morning, preventing them from spreading. When the air raid first started, only the beams of searchlights were seen flashing in the clouds, and anti-aircraft guns fired at the points illuminated by the searchlights. However, sometimes the anti-aircraft guns fired fiercely into the sky without the assistance of searchlights. Last night, German planes first bombed the north, southeast, and southwest of London, and then dropped illuminating bombs with a yellowish glow in central London, followed by high-explosive bombs, causing terrifying explosions in central London. A government office building in western London was destroyed by a large bomb, and all the glass windows of all the buildings around the office were shattered. German planes then scattered their "Molotov bread baskets" over the commercial area of southwestern London, causing terrible damage. A large bomb hit an apartment and a famous restaurant in the western section, killing and injuring several people. Some people in the apartment who were in the study were killed, and those in the bathroom were injured. Only those living on the lowest floor of the building were spared. The upper two floors of the restaurant were destroyed. The diners on the lowest floor stopped eating, as the room was plunged into darkness after the building was bombed. In addition, dozens of other buildings, shops, and houses were destroyed, including two hospitals. It is reported that the casualties in the two hospitals were extremely heavy after being bombed. At least four places in western London suffered severe damage. German planes also dropped countless carbonized luminous bombs over central London, illuminating an area several miles wide. The German planes apparently flew at an altitude of 30,000 feet last night, hoping to evade the fierce anti-aircraft fire and the beams of countless searchlights.

<p>London - Last night, at nearly 8 o'clock (4 o'clock this morning Shanghai time), when German planes appeared over London, launching the 122nd air raid since the start of the war on the British capital, anti-aircraft guns fired in unison, sounding like thunder. During the day yesterday, two large batches of German planes attempted to sneak into London but were repelled by British defenses. Air raid warnings were issued twice in London, but no enemy planes penetrated. Over 150 German planes in the first raid yesterday flew in close formation to the mouth of the Thames, where they were scattered by British artillery and fighter planes. It was reported that a German bomber crashed into the sea off Whitstable. Ten minutes later, a second batch of enemy planes arrived, where they were fiercely attacked by a large number of British Hurricane fighters, and immediately turned back and fled, fighting as they retreated. British planes pursued them fiercely to near Calais, and had already shot down one enemy plane. Although the fighter planes protecting these two batches of enemy planes were more numerous than before, they were all defeated. Several towns at the mouth of the Thames were hit by bombs, some of which fell in working-class areas. Before dusk yesterday, a Heinkel German plane attacked a town on the southeast coast and was about to fly back when it was engaged by British forces, leading to a fierce battle. Soon, three German planes were seen catching fire and crashing. (Reuter's dispatch on the 25th)</p>

<p>Berlin - Last night, Berlin issued another air raid warning. British bombers again attempted to penetrate Berlin through intense anti-aircraft fire. However, as a result, the British planes were only able to bomb the outer areas. The air raid warning lasted for two hours and forty-eight minutes. It is reported that the British planes dropped many bombs during this period. According to official reports, several British planes attempted to penetrate Berlin, but were blocked by intense anti-aircraft fire, and most of the bombs dropped by the British planes landed in fields. Several civilian houses were bombed in the outer areas, and there were some casualties. A hospital was hit by an incendiary bomb, but there was no damage. The extent of other damage is still unknown. This British air raid was far less significant compared to the longest and most intense air raid since the start of the war last night. (United Press dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>London - An Air Ministry communique stated that British planes bombed the ports where the Nazis were preparing to invade Britain again last night. (Reuter's dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>London - The Air Ministry Information Office stated that the British Air Force bombed Berlin on Sunday night, with an average of one batch of British planes dropping bombs every four and a half minutes, continuing for several hours. This was the most intense attack on Berlin by British planes. Bombs were dropped on predetermined targets. Several bombers braved the harsh weather and circled over their targets for up to fifty minutes to accurately aim and drop their bombs. The targets attacked included the railways near the Postdammer and Rielde train stations, the West Suburb Power Station, and the Morbett and Klingenberg power stations, which were all hit and caught fire. According to one aircraft report, eight explosions were heard as railway sidings were bombed, and railway buildings subsequently caught fire. Large fires had broken out at the Klingenberg and other power stations, and British planes continued to drop large bombs, causing the fire to intensify. When the British planes flew back from the area, they flew low over the Schiphol airfield in Amsterdam, strafing its anti-aircraft lights. After the Morbett Power Station was bombed and five large fires broke out, the British planes that arrived later were able to identify the target by the firelight and dropped large bombs in continuous explosions. The flames were so intense that they could be seen from eighty miles away. Furthermore, the Charlottenburg and Wilmersdorf power stations were also bombed and caught fire. The gas plant on Danziger Strasse exploded violently after being hit, with flames shooting upwards, and the gas plants in Neukölln and Charlottenburg were also attacked and exploded, catching fire. Other targets hit included the Charlottenburg railway, the Spandau aircraft engine factory, the Tempelhof airfield, and the Siemens factory. According to a British aircraft that attacked the large gas plant in the northeastern part of Berlin and returned to base, the aircraft flew 1,200 miles round trip without encountering any obstacles. However, the British aircraft that flew later encountered strong resistance when approaching Berlin. After Berlin was heavily bombed, hundreds of fires broke out, and the sky was red. When Hamburg was attacked, a batch of large bombs hit the Blohm + Voss shipyard, and the entrance to the Kiel Canal was also hit by bombs and exploded. British planes attacked the port of Boulogne, bombing the inner harbor dock basin, causing a large fire. Twenty to thirty ships were berthed in the harbor, and one was hit, caught fire, and destroyed. British planes also flew to the port of Calais, dropping bombs that hit ships and the harbor basin.

<p>London - The Air Ministry Information Office announced that the British Air Force continued to bomb the French and Belgian coasts. The Brest naval base was attacked by British planes yesterday morning. Large bombs hit torpedo boat stations, oil tanks, and warehouses, causing loud explosions and fires everywhere. The port was shrouded in thick smoke, and the flames soared into the sky, visible from more than thirty miles off the French coast. British coastal aircraft also bombed the canal in Zeebrugge, dropping multiple batches of bombs, with intense flames after the explosions. (Reuter's dispatch on the 25th)</p>

<p>Berlin - According to the German High Command, German aircraft conducted armed reconnaissance in England, bombing military targets in London, destroying railways in the Dover area, harbors in Hastings and Brighton, and aircraft factories in Southampton. Air battles occurred frequently, and German aircraft were victorious. German aircraft sank a 3,000-ton merchant ship near the southeast coast of Ireland. Another merchant ship was hit and caught fire. A merchant ship was also hit at the entrance to a canal. A German torpedo boat sank a 2,000-ton armed merchant ship near the south coast of England. German aircraft launched a night raid on London. Harbors and military targets in Liverpool and Cardiff suffered heavy losses. British planes attacked Berlin from the north last night, but were unsuccessful due to intense anti-aircraft fire, only hitting a hospital and several houses. British aircraft lost twenty planes yesterday, eighteen of which were shot down in aerial combat, and two were shot down by anti-aircraft guns. Ten German aircraft are missing.

<p>London - Yesterday afternoon, five German motor torpedo boats patrolled outside Cape Gris-Nez in France. Six British planes bombed them. The German boats were sailing in a line a few miles off the French coast, clearly visible from the coast of Kent in England. A German seaplane was circling above them, but six British Air Force bombers suddenly emerged from the clouds high above, diving to bomb. Water sprayed up to a hundred feet beside the boats, making it impossible to see the bombing situation. As the British bombers ascended to prepare for another attack, Spitfire fighters soared in the air to protect them. No direct hits were seen on the German boats. They all turned around and sped towards the coast. However, according to one eyewitness, after the spray and smoke from two British plane attacks cleared, all the German boats had disappeared. It is suspected that some had sunk. (Reuter's dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>London - The Air Ministry released a communique last night stating that yesterday afternoon, a squadron of British bombers, escorted by fighters, attacked enemy minesweepers in the English Channel. Two ships were hit, and another was damaged by bombs exploding near the ship. At that time, enemy fighters arrived to counterattack. One British bomber was shot down, and one enemy plane was also destroyed. (Reuter's dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<h3 id="e30">Second Year of the War, British Shipping, Mr. Cross Explains the Situation, Hopes the Public Will Save on Shopping <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>London - Shipping Minister Cross released an article last night, describing the situation at the beginning of the second year of the war, stating that the number of ships controlled by Britain today is greater than before the war. However, as the war continues, the demand for ships is increasing. Germany now controls only two-thirds of its pre-war tonnage, and its routes are limited to the Baltic Sea and certain parts of the European coastline. Italy's situation is the same as Germany's, controlling only three-quarters of its pre-war tonnage. Britain is different. Although British ships have been attacked by submarines, planes, raiders, motor torpedo boats, and mines, they are still operating continuously in the ocean. Eight percent of British merchant ships have been lost due to enemy action. However, the ships captured by Britain, the newly built ships, and the ships transferred from foreign countries not only make up for the losses, but there is also a surplus. However, the shipping situation is not the same as before the war, because the raw materials that used to be transported from Europe now have to be purchased from faraway places, and the ships that originally traveled through the Mediterranean Sea now have to travel around the Cape of Good Hope. In addition, many ships have been converted into armed cruisers, and many ships are dedicated to transporting the raw materials needed to manufacture military supplies, so that the tonnage of ships available for ordinary cargo is greatly reduced. However, Britain still has enough ships to meet all the major needs of imports and exports. It is hoped that the public will save on the purchase of non-essential goods, because Britain's current imports are between four and five million tons per month, while in peacetime they were one million tons.

<h3 id="e32">European War Miscellany (10) (3) Hitler's Private Life Snippets <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>Hitler expressed his contempt for foreign governments that "indulged" newspapers with freedom of expression. I heard him say, "These governments are simply spineless. Newspapers should speak according to the will of the government, not dictate to the government. Keeping a free newspaper is like tolerating an ulcer. Newspapers with freedom of speech are like ulcers, truly disgusting things in the country."</p>
<p>After dictating official documents, he would talk with political and military advisors. He could not tolerate even a word of criticism from others. Only Göring could be considered the most daring person in all of Germany to speak to him frankly. However, even he did so with great caution.</p>
<p>After dinner, Hitler often engaged in long night talks with friends until dawn. He had several lifelong attendants who were skilled pianists. When he felt mentally exhausted, he would ask one of them to play a piece of music for relaxation. He loved Wagner's music and the passionate performances of several German and Austrian musicians. He hated "jazz" dance music and often called English and American music "black people's乱弹 [luàn tán - rambling; nonsensical talk/music]". If he went to bed very late but couldn't fall asleep, he would get out of bed and return to his study, and wake up a guest to talk to him. When Goebbels lived in his villa, this "good" errand was always his responsibility. He would be dragged out of bed to listen respectfully to his leader's propaganda plans drafted in a few hours. Goebbels always sat there until dawn. At night, the kitchen was constantly staffed to be ready for coffee and snacks at any time.</p>
<p>If Hitler wanted to read or talk in the quiet of the night, he would often take his giant black car for a night drive. I often saw his car drive out of the garage in the middle of the night and speed away. He was too timid to drive himself. But he liked driving fast. His driver told me that the speed during night drives was always above sixty miles per hour, sometimes reaching one hundred miles per hour.</p>
<p>Hitler took extreme precautions against his enemies' petty calculations. He was most afraid of being poisoned in his food. Several hours before he ate, he had a chemical analyst thoroughly test all food samples. Hitler was not reassured by simply tasting for poisonous substances, because he was afraid that someone would use chronic poisoning as a hidden weapon against him. After the food had been tested by the chemist, only four chefs were allowed to touch it.</p>
<p>His treatment of the servants in his residence was often unpredictable. Sometimes, when you stood in front of him, he seemed not to notice you at all, which was truly uncomfortable. At other times, he would fly into a rage over the most trivial matters, such as tidying up his room or pouring too much coffee.</p>
<p>His strange temperaments were numerous. Often, over some very trivial matter that he thought disturbed him, he would cry like a madman. He would tell the person who offended him that they were deliberately disturbing him, preventing him from concentrating on the great task of saving Germany. If that person did not immediately beg for his forgiveness, they were sure to be sent to a concentration camp for training. However, sometimes he was extraordinarily gentle. He told the servants that everyone was a partner in the work, and that the responsibilities borne by his chefs were no less than those of his officers. His attitude was often like this after he had done a "tricky thing."</p>
<p>Although Hitler did not like women with heavy makeup or deliberately flirtatious behavior, he was just like ordinary people, fond of pretty faces and slender figures. He always invited five or six beautiful women to accompany him at his banquets. Guests at his banquets were not very happy, because smoking and drinking were restricted, and Hitler only liked one kind of music. However, who would dare to decline an invitation?</p>
<p>Servants often enjoyed watching guests sneak into other rooms to smoke and drink when Hitler wasn't paying attention. Usually, they sneaked into the room of the SS commander to find other joys. If they were unlucky and one of the sneaking guests was noticed by Hitler, a servant would have to call him back to listen respectfully to the reprimand for "leaving without permission."</p>
<p>Hitler was a person who couldn't stand laughter, especially jokes that satirized politics or were sarcastically abusive. Therefore, guests had little conversation or joy at the banquet table, but simply listened to the leader speak, like at a political conference.</p>
<p>Hitler's Triumphant Grand Occasion (Chronicle see previous Japan column)</p>
<p>When being a guest in Hitler's villa, you need to abide by the rules stipulated in the "Guest Notice." These regulations were printed on a single sheet of paper placed under the dressing table mirror in the guest's bedroom. I secretly took one out when I left Berchtesgaden, which reads:</p>
<p>1.  Smoking is prohibited in all areas except this bedroom.</p>
<p>2.  Guests should not converse with servants or ask them to deliver any packages or letters.</p>
<p>3.  In conversations or audiences, the title "Führer" must be used; do not use "Mr. Hitler" or other titles.</p>
<p>4.  Female guests should not wear heavy makeup, and nail polish is prohibited.</p>
<p>5.  When dining, please gather in the dining hall within two minutes after hearing the bell. Guests should not take their seats or leave until the Führer is seated or has retired.</p>
<p>6.  Guests should stand up immediately when the leader enters the room.</p>
<p>7.  Unless notified by the Führer, guests must rest by 11:00 PM every night.</p>
<p>8.  Guests must stay in the guest area. Entry to private rooms, offices, or political police stations is prohibited.</p>
<p>9.  When leaving Berchtesgaden, guests must not tell outsiders about their visit. The Führer's conversations must be kept strictly confidential. Those who disclose the Führer's private life will be severely punished.</p>
<p>Hitler's health had long been poor, although he never mentioned it to close confidants. Only a few people in the world knew about this, such as the famous German heart and throat specialist Professor Sauerbruch, who had performed three operations for Hitler; Professor Morell, a famous Berlin doctor and Hitler's lifelong personal physician; Professor Henri Steinmetz; and several other experts from Paris or New York. They could all keep Hitler's secrets.</p>
<p>There was a time when Hitler's heart troubled him greatly. When state affairs piled up waiting to be handled, he had to rest for a few days and do nothing. He suffered from heart fatigue syndrome. What worried Professor Morell the most was getting him to rest when he wouldn't obey, so he had to inject him with medicine from time to time.</p>
<p>Hitler's dentist, Berlin expert Hardenstein, found it very painful to treat his teeth. He would shout like a child at the slightest injury during tooth extraction. However, he still refused to use gas, fearing anesthetics. He only accepted them as an exception in cases of serious surgery. He had eight dentures and several gold inlays in his mouth.</p>
<p>To protect himself, Hitler hired two doubles. Their names could only be called out by the secret police who employed them. In private rooms, their true faces could still be recognized, but once they put on Hitler's clothes and were made up by experts, it was impossible to distinguish them from twenty yards away.</p>
<p>Four female servants rotated weekly to clean Hitler's bedroom. However, the male servant Freese was always present to supervise. The bedroom was simply decorated, with a large iron bed, a small half-table, a large table by the window, a sofa, a writing desk, and a bookcase. There was a small dressing room next door.</p>
<p>The bed was covered with a large brown bedsheet embroidered with a large swastika. Hitler's pajamas were the most beautiful and attractive of all his clothes. They were made of brown satin, with dark brown cuffs and lapels. The pocket had a red and black swastika. There was also a thick silk shirt in the same color. On the table beside the bed, there were often pencils and writing paper. Used pieces of paper were torn up every morning by Hitler or Freese. One day, when I was cleaning the room, I saw a crumpled piece of paper next to the wastepaper basket on the floor. I took the opportunity to stuff it into my pocket when Freese wasn't paying attention. Driven by curiosity, I wanted to see what Hitler wrote on the paper during sleepless nights.</p>
<p>I didn't take it out to look at until I returned to my own bedroom. The paper was covered with what looked like a rough map of some area. It was very scrawled and meaningless, with a few words of some sort. I couldn't figure out what it was about at all, so I put it in a drawer as a souvenir.</p>
<p>Two days later, it happened to be the day of the monthly report to the police station. Everyone working in Berchtesgaden had to go to the police station on the designated day each month to answer questions. If Hitler had any complaints about the servants, no matter how trivial, they would be fined or confined to the house for a month.</p>
<p>Because I believed I had done nothing wrong, I felt very honest in my heart when I stood before the police officer. He carefully read every item on the report and then said happily, "Miss, your report is very good."</p>
<p>I smiled and thanked him, and then he said gently, "Do you feel like there's anything you haven't gotten off your chest? Or anything that the Chamberlain [Shèlì Péng - transliteration of a foreign name/title] didn't notice?"</p>
<p>I looked at him in a daze. But I really couldn't think of anything, so I told him what I thought. Then he suddenly asked me:</p>
<p>"Miss, where is the piece of paper you took from the Führer's bedroom?"</p>
<p>This was a trap they had set. The piece of paper was deliberately placed on the floor. I argued that I thought it was waste paper that was about to be destroyed. I knew myself that this argument was unsustainable. The police officer told me to go back and wait in my room for further instructions. I sat alone in the room in great fear.</p>
<p>In the evening, the Chamberlain sent someone to call me to receive instructions. I was very lucky to only be fined three months' salary and confined to the house for one month. This was because I had always been without fault and had a very good record. Besides, I think it was because I usually had good relationships with the Chamberlain and the deputy housekeeper Elsa. Of course, I received a scolding, and if I committed another offense in the future, I would definitely be sent to a concentration camp. (The End)</p>

<h3 id="e33">Traffic in the French Concession Also Paralyzed; Trams Still Operating; Trolleybuses and Buses All Stopped; Workers Present Conditions, Negotiations Today <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>Since all workers of the British-owned Shanghai Electric Tramways Company in the Public Concession went on strike on the 20th, the workers of the British-owned China Motor Bus Company, because the company had delayed in responding to the proposed labor-management reciprocity agreement, followed the tram workers and went on strike the day before yesterday (the 24th), causing the complete paralysis of public transportation in the concession. Unexpectedly, amidst the two strikes in the Public Concession, the buses and trolleybuses of the French Concession went on strike yesterday morning due to demands for improved treatment. Although the authorities of the two concessions and relevant people from all walks of life all want to mediate, there are still many key issues, and I am afraid they cannot be resolved with a few words. The details obtained from all parties yesterday are recorded separately below.</p>
<h3 id="e34">The Strike Situation in the French Concession <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>According to reporters' investigations, after the workers of the buses and trolleybuses in the French Concession went on strike yesterday morning, they immediately convened a general meeting at noon. In addition to passing sixteen conditions to be presented to the management, they also elected officials. As for the representatives to negotiate with the company, they can also be introduced today and will begin negotiations with the management on the same day. According to a worker, the reason for the strike, in addition to the workers' demands that the company authorities improve treatment due to the increase in the level of living, is also because workers and the general management often have conflicts due to job relations, resulting in repeated punishments.</p>
<p>Trams Operate as Usual</p>
<p>The French Concession has bus routes only on two lines: Route 21 from Dapu Bridge to the Bund, and Route 22 from Xujiahui to the Bund. Trolleybuses only have Route 17 from Xieqiao to the Great World, and Routes 18 from Dapu Bridge to the Great World. All of these routes were suspended yesterday morning. Although trams are still operating as usual, the number of vehicles has been reduced, and the routes have also been greatly shortened. The French Concession has a total of 40 trolleybuses, 60 trams, and 63 buses, and each vehicle has two or three Vietnamese police officers stationed on board to monitor and protect it to prevent accidents.</p>
<p>Hand Grenade Fired in Xujiahui</p>
<p>Since all buses and trolleybuses were suspended yesterday morning, trams were also drawn into the whirlpool. Later, with the efforts of the French authorities and the police, the tram lines were able to resume operation at 9:00-10:00 AM, barely maintaining a line of transportation in the French Concession. However, the number of vehicles and the routes were shortened and reduced. Three vehicles on Route 1, five vehicles on Route 2, six vehicles on Route 7, and two vehicles on Route 10. At about 4:00 PM yesterday afternoon, when a Route 2 vehicle was driving to Xujiahui, there was a sudden loud noise, and a hand grenade exploded on the roadside, fortunately without injuring anyone. As a result, vehicles running to Xujiahui turned around at Route Ferguson [Fú Kāisēn - transliteration], and Route 10 vehicles only drove to the Lu Ban Road intersection and turned around, without driving straight to Zhaojiawan [Zhào Jiāwān - place name].</p>
<p>Strict Precautions Near Factories</p>
<p>After learning of the strike of the bus and trolleybus workers yesterday, the French Concession Municipal Council Police Department and the police sent many Vietnamese police officers and police personnel to Lu Ban Road, the intersection of Route Conti [Kāng Dì - transliteration], the bus factory around the bus factory and the intersection of Lu Ban Road and Xujiahui Road, and the vicinity of the Works Bureau to maintain strict precautions. French police gun trucks also went out in full force, patrolling back and forth on major roads.</p>
<p>Thirty-odd Workers Arrested for Holding Meeting</p>
<p>It was heard that at 11:00 AM yesterday, near the French Electric Tramways Company on Route Conti, more than 30 workers from the tram company's ticket sales, drivers, and machine room, coppersmith room, etc. attempted to gather near the company for a meeting. The police learned of this and sent a large number of patrol officers to arrest the workers holding the meeting. They are currently being investigated by the political department.</p>
<p>Strike Causes Reported by Western Newspapers</p>
<p>The English-language *Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury* reported that Chinese workers of the French Electric Tramways Company announced a general strike this morning (25th), causing the French Concession trams and buses operated by the company to fail to run, and the public transportation of the two concessions came to a complete halt. The strike of the French Electric Tramways Company only closely followed the strikes of the tram and bus companies in the Public Concession.</p>
<p>A Few Trams Still Maintained</p>
<p>Although the French Electric Tramways Company encountered a strike, it still sent a few trams this morning to maintain the main line business of Route Museum and Route Avenue Joffre, with one vehicle passing every ten minutes, driven by senior Chinese and Western ticket inspectors from the tram company. Each vehicle had an armed patrol officer to protect it to prevent disruptions by strikers. The general public is now concerned that the strike of the tram workers in the French Concession may spread to factories and large shops.</p>
<p>Large Number of Chinese People Demonstrate</p>
<p>Mr. Pfeiffer, manager of the French Electric Tramways Company, said this morning that two or three hundred strangers were carrying out a demonstration outside the Lu Ban Road depot, and posted strike slogans, which were dispersed by patrol officers. At the same time, 5,000 workers from the British Electric Tramways and Bus Companies are still in a state of stalemate today, as no labor-management consultations have been heard. It is also heard that the Yijun [义军 - volunteer troops/militia] are not ignoring the British ownership and have agreed to provide full assistance to the police in the event of an incident. It is also heard that the volunteer soldiers helped the patrol officers intercept the striking workers from the depot yesterday (24th), and today they are constantly exploring the situation in the depot.</p>
<h3 id="e35">No Contact from Buses Yesterday <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>The workers of the British-owned Bus Company in the Public Concession, due to demands for improved treatment, broke down negotiations with the company authorities on the 23rd, and declared a strike the day before yesterday (24th). The labor side has held a meeting to decide to prepare four preconditions to be presented to the company authorities for acceptance, so that work can be resumed first, and then the 23 articles can be resolved. Only yesterday, the labor side believed that these preconditions might need to be partially revised, so yesterday they did not submit them to the company authorities in writing or verbally. There was also no contact between the labor and management sides. As for when negotiations will begin, or when a third party will mediate, reporters have inquired from all sides, but there is no definite news.</p>
<p>Threats to Life Forced This Action</p>
<p>According to a person in charge of the labor side, who told reporters, "This strike has caused anxiety and inconvenience to all sectors of society, and we express our deep regret. However, the company cannot consistently use perfunctory means to deal with the reasonable demands put forward by the workers. The workers, forced by the threat to life, struggling on the starvation line, have no choice but to take this action to urge the company to wake up. We will never take any drastic actions that damage the company's property or harm social security. All workers hold a calm and persevering attitude, waiting for the company's awakening, so as to accommodate reasonable demands. What we are striving for with all our strength is to obtain a reliable guarantee for our livelihood so that we can work with peace of mind in an environment of warmth and fullness."

<p>The Municipal Savings Movement Committee previously issued a message appealing to compatriots from all walks of life to enthusiastically promote the Cold Clothing Allowance Movement. Now, as the climate turns cold, the soldiers on the front line urgently need cold clothing to keep out the cold, so it is specially requested that all circles give full play to their conscience and enthusiastically donate to fulfill their national duty. The original text is recorded as follows: Dear compatriots of the city, the National Cold Clothing Movement Committee initiated and led local branches and charitable organizations to raise three million pieces of cold clothing. All sectors of the city have started cold clothing allowances due to transportation difficulties. Now that the weather is getting colder day by day, we think of millions of soldiers, and at the same time, we think of</p>
<p>Displaced and Wandering</p>
<p>Tens of millions of suffering compatriots in the gullies, we people in the rear are really obliged to raise cold clothing. Especially the people living in this Shanghai Concession, they should take special responsibility. Try to see which area in the country can be as safe as Shanghai, and which people can enjoy what the people of Shanghai enjoy. We are all descendants of Yan and Huang, why should we only care about personal safety and enjoyment? If the citizens of Shanghai still only care about selfishness and self-interest, and do not use enthusiasm to promote the cold clothing</p>
<p>Raising Cold Clothing</p>
<p>Allowance movement, which accounts for the first place in the country, how can we be worthy of the country, how can we be worthy of the nation, how can we be worthy of the soldiers and suffering compatriots? If the citizens of Shanghai can do their best to solicit applications for this cold clothing allowance movement, regardless of their strength, regardless of gender or age, at least they can reduce some</p>
<p>Conscience Condemnation</p>
<p>Slightly fulfill the national duty. I hope that all sectors of Shanghai, whether agriculture, industry, commerce, or academia, should automatically promote and actively solicit applications, and contribute to the government in terms of material resources, financial resources, and manpower.</p>

<p>The tram strike in the Public Concession, which has reached six days, is in a stalemate due to the failure of the labor and management sides to approach the conditions for resuming work. Yesterday, the workers did not send representatives to the company to negotiate. The labor side still insists that the management must first accept the four preconditions before agreeing to resume work, but the management has not shown any signs of compromise as of yesterday. Therefore, the stalemate between the two sides is not easy to break for a while. According to another news, the Industrial Section of the Public Concession Public Works Department will assume the responsibility of mediation after understanding the situation of the labor and management sides.</p>

He noticed three Chinese men loitering suspiciously near the Jisi Garden on the road. A few minutes later, he saw these men approach the back gate of the park. The detective and others went out of the park gate at that time. At this time, these men were stopping a rickshaw to search the passengers, the detective immediately ordered them to raise their hands. One of them had a handgun and resisted by refusing to obey. Thereupon, the detective opened fire, resulting in the arrest of all three bandits and the confiscation of a handgun. One of the bandits later died from his injuries.</p>
<p>Also, at about 12:00 noon on July 24th, Chinese constable No. 2482, Zhang Ruisheng, was on duty near the Yinghua Lane entrance on Labaisen Road (Avenue Dubail) near Hede Road.

<h3 id="e54">Commonalities Between Confucianism and Buddhism (1) <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Zhongyi</p>
<p>Confucianism calls them sages, Buddhism calls them Buddhas; Confucianism calls them worthies, Buddhism calls them Bodhisattvas; their names are different, their meanings are the same. Confucianism has the distinction between lesser and greater Confucians; Buddhism has the distinction between Hinayana and Mahayana. Hinayana refers to the *Shravakas* and *Pratyekabuddhas*, also called, those who carry ordinary people. Mahayana, then, is the basis from which all past, present, and future Buddhas receive blessings. The one and only doctrine that is common to all in the ten directions and unchanging in the three ages is that they all rely on correct practice to understand falsity and attain truth, to transform delusion into enlightenment, to proceed from cause to effect, to transcend the mundane and enter the sacred, and to reach the state of Great Enlightenment, the Tathagata. What the two vehicles of *Shravakas* and *Pratyekabuddhas* cultivate are the Four Noble Truths and the Twelve Links of Dependent Origination. The path of the Mahayana Bodhisattva, then, is the Six *Paramitas*. In Sanskrit, *paramita*. Classics often shorten it to *parami*. In Chinese, Kumarajiva's old translation is "crossing over," and Xuanzang's new translation in the Tang Dynasty is "arriving at the other shore." It actually contains two meanings, referring to the great practice of the Bodhisattva, which ultimately involves the affairs of benefiting oneself and benefiting others. When these affairs are ultimately carried out, relying on this great practice, one can leave this shore of life and death and reach the other shore of Nirvana, called arriving at the other shore. Because this great practice can cross over the vast expanse of all phenomena, it is called limitless crossing over. There are six kinds of *paramitas*: first, *dana*; second, *sila*; third, *ksanti*; fourth, *virya*; fifth, *dhyana*; and sixth, *prajna*. Therefore, they are called the Six *Paramitas*.</p>
<p>The First is Called *Dana Paramita*</p>
<p>*Dana* in Chinese means generosity. It means giving benefits to others without being stingy or jealous; that is, charitable undertakings and great compassion that benefit sentient beings, and can save others from suffering, is called compassion. The Buddha Bodhisattva's compassion is vast, so it is called great compassion. Briefly speaking, there are four types:</p>
<p>First, Material Giving</p>
<p>The *Mahaprajnaparamita Sutra* translated by Kumarajiva states: "Good thoughts corresponding to a giving heart are called *dana*. There are three types of *dana*: maintaining precepts and self-restraint, and not infringing on the property of all sentient beings, which is practicing material giving." The *Dharma Garden Theory* states: "There are five types of material giving: first, giving wholeheartedly; second, giving with faith; third, giving at the right time; fourth, giving with one's own hands; fifth, giving according to the law. There are also five things that should not be given: first, wealth obtained through unreasonable means should not be given to others, because the object is impure; second, alcohol and poisonous substances should not be given to others, because they confuse sentient beings; third, traps and nets should not be given to others, because they trouble sentient beings; fourth, music and female beauty should not be given to others, because they corrupt the pure mind." The *Upasaka Precept Sutra* translated by Dharmaraksa of Northern Liang states: "Those without wealth say that they have no wealth; this meaning is not so. Why? Everyone has all water and grass. Even a king does not necessarily give, even the poor are not unable to give.</p>
<p>Therefore, there are no people who cannot give, but there are things that cannot be given. Wealth that is not just is not originally ours. How can we give it to others? As for food that harms health, instruments that injure life, conduct that disturbs peace, and objects that corrupt virtue, all are in the category of prohibited giving. The measure of great compassion is as thorough as this.</p>
<p>Mencius said: "The heart of compassion is the beginning of benevolence." Is the Buddha's giving the same as Confucius and Mencius' benevolence? Benevolence is the meaning of people interacting with each other; that is, being able to treat mankind and exhaust the relationship and assistance between each other is what is called benevolence. Therefore, the *Analects* states: "The benevolent man, wishing to establish himself, also establishes others; wishing to enlarge himself, he also enlarges others. To be able to take near at hand analogies may be called the method of benevolence."</p>
<p>Second, Effort Giving</p>
<p>The *Upasaka Precept Sutra* also states: "Among the people in the world, who is so poor that they have no body? If they have a body, seeing others doing good deeds, their body should go to help, which is also called a benefactor, and also obtains blessings."</p>
<p>Therefore, this is because human power is insufficient. What my power can do is to help each other, so it is called giving of effort; that is, those who have wealth give wealth, and those who have effort give effort. The giving is the same. Perfecting the beauty of adults and helping the world is the effort giving of Confucianism! In the past, the father of Confucius, Shu Lianghe, broke open the gate of Biyang City and saved the teacher who was trapped. It is one example of effort giving.</p>
<p>Third, Dharma Giving</p>
<p>The *Mahaprajnaparamita Sutra* also states: "Being able to preach the Dharma in various ways, causing them to hear and understand, is called Dharma giving." The *Adbhutadharma Sutra*, also called the Sutra of Unprecedented Dharma or Wonderful Dharma, is one of the Twelve Divisions of Scripture. It is quite capable of summarizing the essentials of both material and Dharma giving, saying, "Giving food and drink saves a life for a day. Giving treasures and wealth saves a generation from poverty, increasing bondage. Explaining the Dharma and teaching and transforming is called Dharma giving, which can lead all sentient beings to transcendent wisdom." The *Mahapurisalaksana Sastra* by Devapala Bodhisattva, translated by Dao Ti of Northern Liang, is truly capable of distinguishing the flavor of both material and Dharma giving, saying, "Material giving removes the physical suffering of sentient beings, creating endless money and wealth for them, so that they may obtain physical pleasure, be loved by sentient beings, and be loved by foolish people, giving present happiness. Dharma giving removes the mental suffering of sentient beings, creating endless wisdom for them, so that they may obtain mental pleasure, be respected by the world, and be loved by wise people, giving the happiness of Nirvana."</p>
<p>Therefore, Dharma giving is most valued by both Confucianism and Buddhism. As the saying goes, "Persuade with your mouth for one generation, persuade with books for a hundred generations." Writing and establishing words is the Dharma giving of Confucianism! The Five Teachings and Three Periods of the Tathagata, speaking the Dharma according to conditions, are the same as Confucius's teaching according to aptitude, and educating without discrimination, and Mencius's joy in nurturing talent, cultivating virtue, and achieving talent. Confucius's kind and skillful guidance of people, learning without weariness and teaching without discouragement, teaching without weariness is benevolence. Therefore, teaching without weariness is Confucius's Dharma giving. Distinguishing between kingly and hegemonic ways, and speaking of benevolence and righteousness, is Mencius's Dharma giving.</p>
<p>Fourth, Fearlessness Giving</p>
<p>The *Mahaprajnaparamita Sutra* also states: "Sentient beings fear death, relying on precepts and not harming, which is called fearless giving."</p>
<p>Therefore, "If I hear the Dao in the morning, I can die content in the evening." It is like this that the Dao cannot be heard. If one's faith in the Dao is not strong, and one knows that one cannot achieve it, one bears this body in vain, as if one had not heard it. Therefore, the power of great vows must be pursued with a fearless spirit. Confucius's "not yielding to benevolence" and Mencius's "Do I like disputing?" are the fearless giving of Confucius and Mencius. As for Confucius's saying, "kill oneself to achieve benevolence," and Mencius's saying, "sacrifice life to achieve righteousness," because their righteousness is exhausted, their benevolence is supreme. Wen Tianxiang said, "What have I learned from reading the books of sages and worthies? Great, earth-shattering, tearful, and songful deeds." Are they all the fearless giving of sages, worthies, and Bodhisattvas?</p>

<p>The Japanese military has implemented control over local and foreign goods in the occupied areas of China, making purchase and sale inconvenient for merchants. This is also being gradually implemented in Shanghai. It has recently been heard that although the Japanese military has not formally implemented control over the export of foreign cloth and cotton yarn, they are paying close attention to it. Exports from the wharves of the Public Concession north of the Yangjingbang have been obstructed. If detained, they are instructed to obtain a permit from the Japanese Naval Accounting Office inside the Zhaoshang North Warehouse in the Tilanqiao area on Broadway before they can be transported out. When barges transport goods to export ships, they must also be detained by the Water Gendarmerie Team when passing the Water Restaurant on the Bund of Beijing Road. In the past, two barges were detained and only released after obtaining permits in accordance with the regulations. It is heard that the inspection work at the wharves of the Shanghai Municipal Council along the Huangpu River is carried out by the Gendarmerie Team on the fifth floor of the Yokohama Specie Bank.

Lan Bing forcibly held the woman's throat to prevent her from making a sound. His friend Kelmen then struck the woman on the head with an iron bar. Lan Bing tore off her small clothes and raped her. After a while, Kelmen pushed the woman out of the car, injuring her face and knees, and they fled. After the incident occurred, the Chinese and Western detectives of the Hongkou Police Department arrested the two Russians, Lan and Kelmen, one after another and sent them to the First Special District Court.

They specialize in abducting boys in this city and the surrounding villages and then transport them to Xiamen, Shantou and other places for sale. Each child can fetch a price of about four hundred yuan. Over the years, no fewer than two hundred children have been abducted. This kind of pursuit of profit, but disregard for the pain of others, is truly worthy of hatred. After the organization was cracked, the detectives arrested 16 members of the party, including the leaders Su Desan and Chen Zhangshi, and recovered six abducted boys in Shanghai, all of whom have been identified by their families. Sixteen children were also recovered on Gulangyu, six of whom have been identified by their families.

Last June, they ordered 1,000 metric tons of coal dust from Da Chang Coal Company, established by Xu Guisheng and Yu Shunmao. They paid the price of 28 yuan per ton from September of last year to March of this year. After the order was placed, the price of coal in Shanghai suddenly soared to over 200 yuan per ton, resulting in a price difference of more than 200,000 yuan from the time of the order. Da Chang, using the excuse that the Sino-American factory was not completed, refused to deliver the goods. Sino-American then hired lawyers Chen Tingrui and Sun Zuji to file a lawsuit against Da Chang for delivery. Although Jin Tingsun and others mediated, it was to no avail. Da Chang was also defended by lawyers Jiang Yiping and others. The result of the trial was a judgment that Da Chang should deliver 1,000 metric tons of Kailuan coal dust to Sino-American, allowing for average fulfillment over seven months, with Da Chang bearing the litigation costs. Da Chang, dissatisfied with the judgment, appealed to the Second Branch of the High Court, which has also concluded the hearing.

Feng Dingzhang is the Dean and Head of the Commerce Department, and Huang Jialu is the Head of the Economics Department. In addition, the university has established several Jiageng Professorships to commemorate Chen Jiageng's contribution to founding the university. In 1940, it was decided that Professors Xie Yuming, Fu Ying, Chen Ziying, Zhou Bianming, and Zhu Baoxun would serve as Jiageng Professors. In 1940, the university further hired eleven professors who have arrived at the university to teach. The university currently has twenty-eight school buildings covering thirty acres. The library has a newly built reading room that can accommodate 140 people. In addition to more than 8,000 Chinese books and more than 3,000 Western books, there are also books stored in Gulangyu.

It has now opened thirteen air-raid shelters, which can accommodate about 1,300 people. In addition to protecting the university's faculty, staff, and students, it can also accommodate dozens of nearby residents. The safety of the university's students is naturally not a concern. Second is life. The university's students are considered to be uniquely favored. At present, the cost of living in Changting is at least 60-70% lower than in Chongqing, Chengdu, Kunming, Guiyang, and other places. Not long ago, the university's food expenses were only 8 yuan per month, and recently increased to 12 yuan. Moreover, the university has various scholarships and loans, and students from poor families with excellent grades can simply not have to pay for themselves. In addition, due to the establishment of the Self-Help Committee, students can also request the committee to introduce work in a suitable way during their spare time after class to provide relief. The university's students wear uniforms, long gowns and suits all year round, which have long disappeared. The pure and simple style is commendable. Their dormitories are organized by grade, and the three colleges are integrated, so the students have truly achieved mutual love and sincerity, with no distinction between colleges and hometowns. Third is activity. The atmosphere of research in the school is very strong, which can be seen from the activities of various societies. Professors volunteer to give lectures outside of class, often several times a week. They can all enthusiastically engage in social services. They actively participate in every donation movement. In particular, the work of promoting people's schools has never been interrupted. All of this is enough to prove that Xiamen University is moving forward closely to develop inland culture.</p>

<p>The charity basketball challenge match, an unfortunate incident, after days of running and mediation by the organizers of the Rich Bureau, the settlement of Mr. Yuan Ludeng, and the solemn criticism of a few ignorant spectators by the world of theory, Paramount finally gave priority to the overall situation and abandoned the original proposal of not participating in the competition, so that the charity cause would not be interrupted by this. His spirit of great justice and selflessness is worthy of admiration. According to Mr. Gu Senkang, the backbone of Paramount, "I feel very sorry for the occurrence of this unfortunate incident. Paramount is not deliberately trying to make things difficult for the charity cause. Until the arrival of this kind of adversity, anyone will be discouraged. Think about the hard work of the players, running around, sweating and fighting, all based on the thought of charity, and the generosity of enthusiastic spectators, which is really the same goal by different routes. Therefore, the purpose of our team's participation in the competition is not to care about winning or losing, but to hope to do our best. In general, a slow offensive strategy does lack stimulating appreciation, but it is very practical during combat. Our team deeply feels that its skills are not yet proficient and its strategy is not high enough, which has not been understood by the audience. Only with the urging of Mr. Yuan, the encouragement of the theoretical community, and the enthusiasm of most charitable spectators, our team has to reluctantly make it difficult again to work with the Shanghai heroes. However, Feng Nianhua, a player from our association, suffered a serious injury to his waist in the battle against Shanghai Star, and Bao Songyuan's facial injury has not yet healed. Therefore, he may not be able to mobilize his troops to fight in two or three days," and so on. In this case, the challenge meeting can continue to be held, and a huge wave has come to an end. However, the battle schedule for the next four games must be re-arranged. Therefore, the third battle between Paramount and Liangxi is when we can catch up and hold it this Sunday, which must be discussed by the Competition Committee before it can be disclosed tomorrow.</p>

<h3 id="e75">Speculation in Yarn and Cotton Yarn Intensifies Again; Exploiting Idle Funds for a Large-Scale Speculative Bubble; Rising Prices Are Difficult to Curb, Buying Higher and Higher <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market is strengthening and the bubble is extremely fierce. This is due to the intense speculative buying trend. General non-industry players have been silent for a long time. In view of the slight increase in current sales and the stronger absorption and promotion, on the one hand, rumors that are beneficial to the multi-party are extremely prevalent. According to the market, the securities gang, the gold gang, and the small silver numbers are probably using the loose money supply to advance to the yarn market to make kick-the-ball transactions. Therefore, the upward force is very strong. However, a certain Feng agency throws out thousands of bales of Shuangma factory orders here during the day. However, a sudden rainstorm is difficult to curb, and it is bought higher and higher. As for the Hong Kong sales market, it has become stagnant.</p>
<p>The current yarn opened in the morning. Amidst the rumors and chaos, the 20-count Shuangma yarn was firm and strong. The first lot rose by more than ten yuan to 1,058 yuan. The lot immediately rose step by step. Although there were large sellers, the market was still advancing. It rose all the way to 1,090 yuan. However, the needs of guest gangs have turned stagnant after the high prices. However, the buying sentiment on the betel surface is still extremely enthusiastic. Although there were some profit-takings in the middle, the market price rose as soon as it returned. It was found that 3,845 bales were traded in half a day, and transactions within the same industry accounted for more than two-thirds. The price of 20-count Shuangma jumped 58 yuan. The amounts bought by each gang are listed as follows:</p>
<p>Same industry 3,010 Hong Kong 825 Ningbo 10 Statistics 3,845</p>
<p>On the 26th, 1,552 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3 id="e76">New Cotton Has Some Sources <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>The current cotton situation has also turned good. This is because the yarn market has risen, and people's hearts have been encouraged accordingly. However, the factory's Chinese merchants are more active in exploration, but the needs of foreign factories are still average. New cotton has some sources.</p>
<p>In other news, the price of foreign cotton, the New York cotton market, was very active in the early morning. Due to good spot transactions and purchases on Wall Street, the closing price rose 34 points compared to the previous day. Indian cotton rose by more than half a rupee yesterday, including forecasts.</p>
<p>The trading of foreign cotton in Shanghai yesterday also increased due to the rise in the price of cotton yarn and the lack of cotton inventory in the market. Therefore, the market was very brisk, especially for those with long fibers. However, 20-count raw cotton was also active because of this.</p>
<h3 id="e77">Financial Foreign Exchange Long-Short Positions: Cautious Observation <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market: HSBC's quoted rates remained stable. The unofficial market for British and American currencies was very stable, lacking excitement. Operators remained cautious and observed the market, resulting in weak buying and selling interest. In the morning, the British pound opened slightly stronger at 3/84.484375, while the US dollar remained unchanged at 5.3125 yuan. Subsequently, due to sales of British gold by Chinese banks, the British pound briefly returned to its opening level. However, around noon, HSBC unexpectedly showed buying interest, causing the British pound to weaken slightly to 0.15625. The US dollar saw mixed fortunes, with the exchange rate rising again to around 3.69 yuan. Trading was not quiet. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon.</p>
<p>In the early morning, London's long and short-term large bills fell by 0.0625. New York silver prices remained stable, and the London gold price remained fixed. Exchange rates for the British pound against the US dollar and Shanghai were stable. The US dollar rose by 0.25 against the British pound and 0.05 against Shanghai. Central Bank quoted rates for various currencies remained unchanged. Bank spot selling prices were 3/84.484375 for the British pound and 5.3125 yuan for the US dollar. Compared to the previous closing, the British pound was up by 0.015625, while the US dollar was stable. The market was quiet after opening, with little trading. After HSBC's quoted rates were announced, there was no change. The silver balancing tax was announced to have fallen by 0.25. Subsequently, Chinese banks suddenly sold spot British gold to British banks at 3/84.484375 and half that amount, causing the British pound to return to its opening level. Although some Chinese merchants subsequently bought in, Chinese banks and foreign banks were still willing to supply. At that time, the situation lacked change. Speculators bought US dollars for September delivery from foreign banks at 5.3125 yuan, and Chinese banks also sold US dollars for October delivery to foreign banks at 5.3125 yuan. As such, around noon, HSBC suddenly bought US dollars for October delivery from other banks at 5.3125 yuan. The market was stable with a slight weakening. At closing, the British pound remained at 3/84.484375 and the US dollar at 5.3125 yuan. The British pound for October delivery was 3/84.46875 and the US dollar was 5.28125 yuan. Compared to the previous day, the British pound was slightly stronger by 0.015625, while the US dollar saw no gains or losses. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon.</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 25th (Wednesday) dispatch: The exchange market opened quietly this morning. There were no gains or losses for the British pound, Japanese yen, or Shanghai currencies. (Spot Shanghai currency closed at 426 yuan yesterday.) The spot US dollar weakened by 0.0625 to 22.8125 yuan (yesterday's close was 22.75 yuan). At 11:30, the spot US dollar strengthened by 0.0625 to 22.75 yuan, while other currencies remained unchanged. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon.</p>
<p>Tianjin, 25th (Wednesday) dispatch: The exchange market opened stable this morning. The spot British pound remained unchanged at 3 pence 375. The spot US dollar continued to weaken by 0.0625 to 5.15625 yuan. The Shanghai currency fell by 1 yuan to 103 yuan. "Joint Notes" soared by 1.75 yuan to 88.50 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e78">Gold Prices Remain Firm <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>The half-day market situation for spot gold fluctuated around the 6,200 yuan level, indicating a firm sentiment. Buying followed selling, and the market was quite active. Despite a slight weakening of the foreign exchange market after HSBC's buying around noon, selling pressure was relatively low, and the price actually rose by several yuan. The opening price was only 6,175 yuan, and after bullion dealers dumped gold, the price was pushed down by several yuan to a low of 6,170 yuan. Subsequently, bullion dealers suddenly reversed course and became buyers, and a certain gold firm frequently pushed up prices. Although spot dealers and some money exchange businesses continuously sold, the market trend finally strengthened. At closing, the price rose to 6,207 yuan, an increase of 7 yuan from the previous day. In the afternoon, trading outside the market initially reached as high as 6,215 yuan. Later, news about the US and Japan caused sentiment to weaken again, and some people sold at 6,190 yuan. About 2,000 taels were traded in the half-day market. Gold jewelry in silver shops was priced 10 yuan lower, while customs gold remained stable.</p>
<p>The market situation was weak in the early morning, with the opening price down 25 yuan. Money exchange businesses sold 20 taels of bullion from silver shops at 6,175 yuan. Subsequently, due to selling by silver shops and bullion dealers, the price fell another 5 yuan, with silver shops trading 20 taels at 6,170 yuan. After being absorbed by a certain gold firm and retail investors, the price rebounded by 20 yuan, with silver shops trading 40 taels at 6,190 yuan. Afterwards, spot dealers and other long positions in money exchange businesses emerged, causing the price to fall back to 6,180 yuan. Thanks to the renewed efforts of a certain gold firm to push up prices, coupled with the healthy buying appetite of silver shops, the price soon rose to 6,210 yuan. Later, a certain spot dealer resold, but high-priced buyers hesitated, causing the price to fall back to 6,195 yuan. Around noon, a certain silver shop saw an opportunity to cover short positions. Although securities firms provided some supply in the meantime, the news that the foreign exchange market was stable to slightly weaker caused the closing price to finally settle at 6,207 yuan, an increase of 7 yuan from the previous day. The market situation was firm after closing, with transactions taking place at 6,215 yuan. The price fluctuated by 40 yuan in the half-day market. The selling price of bullion held by spot dealers was more than 10 yuan higher for spot gold, while the buying price was reduced by 30 yuan. The current marked gold was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there were few transactions.</p>
<p>The selling price of gold jewelry per tael in silver shops was 10 yuan lower at 9:30. However, although the gold market fell and then rebounded, the listed price was not raised, resulting in Da Tong Hang revising its price to 630 yuan. The prices of Xin Tong Hang were similar to the previous prices, with buying prices reduced by around 30 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e79">British Gold Notes Rise Significantly <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw spot gold prices fall and then rise again. In the afternoon, trading outside the market trended lower again. The price of British and American gold pounds fluctuated within a narrow range and ultimately remained stable. The demand for British gold notes suddenly increased, and the market price rose sharply by 5 jiao. American gold notes fluctuated between 18 yuan 6 jiao 5 fen and 7 jiao 5 fen, ultimately rising slightly by 1 fen from the previous day. The demand for Japanese gold notes remained strong, and the market price continued to rise, increasing to 1 yuan 5 jiao 3 fen in the evening market. The supply and demand for Korean notes was balanced, and the market price remained stable, staying at 1 yuan 1 jiao 8 fen in the evening market.</p>
<h3 id="e80">Discount Rate Rises Sharply by Five Yuan <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's discount rate for exchange drafts rose sharply, reversing the previous trend. Due to the excessively low discount rate, holders of cash were cautious and observed the market, resulting in a feeling that even small amounts were difficult to discount. The rate initially rose from around 16 yuan per thousand to 19 yuan for discounting around noon, with a rate of 21 yuan for drawing. In the afternoon, the price was further inflated, reaching a high of 25 yuan. Finally, it eased slightly, with a rate of 20 yuan for discounting and 22 yuan for drawing. However, this was still a sharp increase of 5 yuan. The interest rate for the money industry association rose by 1 fen, with both morning and afternoon markets quoting 1 jiao 2 fen.</p>
<h3 id="e81">Rice Prices Soar, Foreign Rice Prices Fluctuate <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Due to rain reducing the arrival of new rice and the outbreak of war in Vietnam, rice merchants were stimulated, and floating speculators continued to chase prices. Followers inquired in a market atmosphere manipulated by hoarding and speculation, causing prices to rise gradually. Prices for various types of rice rose by nearly one yuan. Although the source of foreign rice remained continuous and inventory was abundant, sentiment was positive due to high domestic rice prices and the situation in Vietnam. Therefore, the market remained firm at closing. Saigon No. 2 rice from Yinghua Company was still quoted at 77 yuan. However, 40-50 tons of Siamese No. 2 rice with foreign expenses were quoted at 74 yuan 8 jiao. There were also over 8,000 bags of foreign rice traded in the spot market, but most of it was speculative trading, with actual sales accounting for less than half. The current prices were 65.50 yuan and 65 yuan for Saigon No. 2, 64.50 yuan and 64 yuan for Siamese No. 2, and 63 yuan 78 jiao for Xiao Jiao. Due to the trend requiring higher prices, the market price for premium foreign rice was not publicly disclosed.</p>
<p>Glutinous rice, both domestic and foreign, also increased by one yuan across the board. Kai Jin Li Special rice was 71 yuan, and Chang Dan rice was around 70 yuan and 69 yuan. The selling price in Hong Kong was similar to that of domestic rice.</p>
<p>Broken and thin japonica rice became scarce due to recent rain, leading to a sense of scarcity amidst the firm prices of foreign rice. As a result, the price rose by one to two yuan. Chang Su japonica rice was heard to be 80 yuan 0.5 jiao, and Su japonica rice was around 79 yuan and 80 yuan. Qing Jiao fresh thin rice was sold for 83 yuan, and Nangang original bags of early rice were 80 yuan, with bulk sales at 78 yuan and 77.5 yuan.</p>
<p>The source of new japonica rice originally relied on bicycle transport, but rain disrupted transportation. Yesterday, only 300-400 piculs arrived from both sides of the river, and prices rose across the board. Japonica rice increased by two yuan, and premium rice increased by one yuan. Kai Zhuan Qiao new japonica rice was 77 yuan and 76.5 yuan. Original bags of Yangjiao premium rice from Jiading Taicang Zhongguan were 67 yuan, with bulk sales at 65.5 yuan and 66 yuan. Qingjiao Dujiao rice was 66 yuan and 65.5 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e82">Flour Market Gradually Stabilizes - Wheat Market Remains Firm and Quiet - <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>The flour market stabilized yesterday. After the No. 2 flour mill revised its price to 16 yuan 5 jiao, the factory indicated that it was unwilling to increase the price further. Reclaimed flour on the market, after reaching a high price of 18 yuan, attracted attention from all parties. A certain factory's announcement of ordering a large quantity of foreign flour also influenced the market, resulting in a gradual stabilization. It was heard that the Dou and Fu factories slightly increased the amount of flour supplied to the street, with each supplying 5,000-6,000 bags to the local and external markets. There were no changes in local and external prices. Foreign flour remained firm and expensive. The supply of fixed-price flour had not been fully confirmed, and the arrival of goods was still distant, making it difficult to calm sentiment. It was heard that 2,000-3,000 bags of Foreign Fortress and Fushou brands were opened, with prices still at 19 yuan.</p>
<p>The wheat market remained firm and quiet yesterday. Japanese and Chinese factories were equally sluggish in their purchases. Because a large amount of foreign wheat had arrived, factories did not seem eager to acquire raw materials, and sellers temporarily lowered their prices due to a lack of supply. As a result, Japanese factories still purchased 2,000-3,000 bags at the original price, while Chinese factories purchased only 100-200 bags, also at the same price of 24 yuan 6 jiao 5 fen to 6 jiao.</p>
<h3 id="e83">Coarse Grains Yellow Soybeans Rise Slightly <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Yellow soybeans are the backbone of coarse grains, so the rise and fall of other grains are inextricably linked to the fluctuations of yellow soybeans. Recently, yellow soybeans have been continuously sold in various markets, but lacking new impetus, they are in a state of hesitation and observation. Yesterday, trading was slightly more active, and prices were slightly higher by two to three jiao compared to the previous market. Transactions included 400 bags of Sangyuan soybeans at 33 yuan 7 jiao, 200 bags of Nanjing soybeans at 33 yuan, dozens of bags of Taicang soybeans at 36 yuan 5 jiao, 300 bags of Anqing soybeans at 33 yuan 6 jiao to 9 jiao, 4 carts of Changzhou Niupi yellow soybeans at 34 yuan 5 jiao, and 50 bags of Chongming Sha yellow soybeans at 32 yuan. Yesterday, 1,355 bags of soybeans were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3 id="e84">Securities and Bond Market Sentiment Wavering <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Due to rumors in the local market yesterday, the bullish trend in the unofficial securities market was thwarted, and there was a surge of selling. The market was flat in the morning and fell by three to five jiao in the afternoon. The unpredictable nature of the Vietnam situation had caused speculators to take a wait-and-see attitude. As the local rumors could not be confirmed, sentiment was wavering. Floating long positions were unloaded, but absorbed by investors. The trend may be temporarily hovering due to the constantly changing environment, and any slight rebound is bound to be limited. In the morning, Shengda, Xinhua, Lianyi, and Runde were all bought one after another, and the long positions of Hongda gradually sold off. Jiufeng also saw more selling. Other groups mostly sold more and bought less, and market prices were flat. In the afternoon, Hongda continued to sell off, Lianyi also sold off slightly, and Zhenkang, Renchang, and Yitai also sought to sell, causing market prices to weaken sharply. Category C securities broke 6 yuan, and Category B fell by 8 yuan. Xinfu, Tongkang, Dingkang, and Lianhe were bought, resulting in a small recovery at closing. However, the market turned firmer again after closing. As a result, prices uniformly fell by three to four jiao to five and a half jiao. The total number of transactions was about one million yuan. A concise table is provided below.</p>
<p>Stock trading: 40 shares of the Home Industry Cooperative were traded at a price of 82 yuan 5 jiao.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the stock market was volatile. The market opened very stable, but a large number of profit-taking sales brought the market down sharply. Subsequently, due to short covering, prices recovered slightly, but the closing price was still significantly lower than the previous day's close.</p>
<p>London, 24th (Tuesday) dispatch: Today, the listed prices of Chinese foreign debt and Far Eastern British companies remained stagnant. Only the shares of the Mercantile Bank of India, London and China showed some improvement, with the price rising by 3 shillings 9 pence to 6 pounds 11 shillings 3 pence. The rest remained unchanged.</p>
<h3 id="e85">New Textile Hoarders Vigorously Purchase Cloth <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Domestic cloth prices rose yesterday due to continued increases in yarn prices. Customers actively bought, and local dealers and new hoarders outside the industry bought from each other, driving up prices vigorously. Prices of various fabrics rose across the board. Fine cloth and fine twill rose by 2.5 jiao to 7.5 jiao per piece, while lightweight coarse cloth rose by 2.5 jiao to 5 jiao. Wholesale stores on the street traded over 500 pieces of various goods, and Guangdong and Hong Kong dealers traded 500-600 pieces of colored cloth and colored twill. Dealers from the Jiangsu and Anhui hinterland also demanded goods, and there were continued large transactions. Today, 465 pieces of cloth were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Local and external parties in the eastern cloth market were unanimously bullish, and the rising trend was particularly strong. Yesterday, the closing price of 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth reached a peak of 34 yuan 4 jiao per piece, a sharp increase of 1 yuan per piece. Four Gentlemen Yuan Serge was 9 jiao 9 fen 375, an increase of about 4 fen per yard. The market atmosphere was very tight, with a tendency to continue to rise and increase.</p>
<h3 id="e86">Seafood and Raw Starch Continue to Be Firm and Expensive <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Raw starch has recently become scarcer, while sales remain active, resulting in a continued firm market. The current market prices are 67 yuan for the Flying Unicorn brand, 65 yuan for the 3A brand, 63 yuan for the XKG brand, 55 yuan for the Peacock brand, and 55 yuan for the Double T brand A, representing an increase of 2 yuan to 4 yuan from the previous market. No. 3 starch rose by only 1 yuan to 45 yuan. Large and small grains of sago rice were both sold for 82 yuan, also increasing by 3 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Sugar Market: Coarse White and Refined White Stable <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>The sugar market saw a slight weakening yesterday due to rising foreign exchange rates. According to Dutch telegrams, the price of coarse white sugar was 9.875, and the Hong Kong telegram price was 23.62. The association's quoted price for spot goods was 80 yuan 3 jiao for coarse white sugar arriving at the warehouse in July (old goods) and 77 yuan 9 jiao. Dutch cotton white KD brand remained at 76 yuan. Dutch red spot goods were 63 yuan, down 0.1 jiao. Road goods arriving on September 30 were 62 yuan 5 jiao. Taikoo refined white D brand was 77 yuan 2 jiao, unchanged. DY brand was 75 yuan 4 jiao, up 0.1 jiao. XH brand was 75 yuan 1 jiao, down 0.2 jiao. There were no quotations for domestic sugar.</p>

<p>The first batches of new sweet almonds such as North Mountain almonds, Dragon King Hat almonds, and Medium almonds have arrived, but due to their high prices, there have been few transactions. Dragon King Hat almonds are quoted at 320 yuan, and Medium almonds are quoted at 250-260 yuan. The buyers' bids are far from the asking prices and have not yet approached.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Hainan Longan Continues to Rise Sharply <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Longan stores have already run out of stock. New goods from production areas such as Xinghua, Quanzhou, Anhai, Tong'an, and Zhangzhou have all entered the market. Due to transportation difficulties, Xinghua, Quanzhou, and Anhai are unlikely to arrive in Shanghai for the time being. Although Zhangzhou and Tong'an could be shipped to Xiamen and then to Shanghai, there is also a lack of transportation due to the official opening of sailing ships. Currently, only Hainan-produced hanging longan is arriving in larger quantities and is relatively cheaper. The lowest price was 124-125 yuan, which then rose to 134-135 yuan. Recently, quoted prices have become tighter, and the market rose by more than ten yuan yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e90">North-South Goods: Black Melon Seeds Arrive with Low Inventory, Price Rises by Ten Yuan <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Black melon seeds have recently become scarce in terms of arrivals and inventory, and production prices have also risen, resulting in a strong rebound in prices. Yesterday, Xu Kui seeds were quoted at 98 yuan, and Xiangcheng seeds at 94 yuan, both up by about 10 yuan. Mingguang seeds were 84 yuan, up 7 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 400 bags of peanuts and 550 bags of peanut kernels were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>

<h3 id="e92">Hardware: New Lead Wire Stagnant, but Firm <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Since the Tianjin group stopped handling new lead wire, the market has been sluggish. However, inventory is very low and the source has been cut off, so standard prices remain firm. Yesterday, medium-grade goods such as #16 to #20 were sold for 85 yuan per dan, while fine colors such as #21 to #25 required 105 yuan per dan. It is estimated that only dozens of dan were traded throughout the city.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Miscellaneous Cigarettes About to Have Taxes "Increased," Market Prices Rising Steadily <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Amidst various rumors about increased cigarette taxes, various cigarette factories have halted shipments, causing public panic and brisk trading in the market. Those in need are raising prices to acquire them, while those holding inventory are reluctant to sell, causing the prices of all brands to rise sharply compared to last week. Yesterday's opening prices were: Great Britain Brand at 1,410 yuan, Old Knife Brand at 930 yuan, Pin Hai Brand at 845 yuan, Wu Hua Brand at 605 yuan, Little Fairy Brand at 685 yuan, Beauty Brand at 710 yuan, and Golden Rat Brand at 400 yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e94">Not a Sacrifice <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Ming</p>
<p>On the 17th of this month, this newspaper published an article by Mr. Yan Zheng titled "The Wife's Sacrifice," the main idea of which is that his wife graduated from a famous girls' middle school in Shanghai, excelling in both character and academics. They initially planned to return home late together after marriage, each fulfilling their responsibilities to the nation and society. Unexpectedly, after having children… his wife had no choice but to abandon her books and ideals, turning into a housekeeper preoccupied with the vegetable market, kitchen, and bedroom. This was a huge sacrifice, making him constantly feel ashamed and wanting to hide! However, she enthusiastically educated their children, as if entrusting her hopes to them. So, even though her eldest younger sister wrote from northern Shaanxi, saying, "Sister is not a mediocre person; on the contrary, you are several times stronger than I am. How unfortunate that you are now buried in trivial family matters!" (This letter made him ashamed once again), she simply smiled and said nothing. In the end, he said with great emotion: "I wonder how many others have made sacrifices like my wife!"</p>
<p>I deeply sympathize with Mr. Yan's sentiments. My wife used to be a university student in Hangzhou, excelling in debate and possessing strong organizational skills, often taking on important roles in extracurricular activities. As a result, her teachers predicted that she would become a leading figure in society. Unexpectedly, the August 13th Incident occurred, preventing her from returning to Hangzhou to study. Moreover, due to the nature of my job, I might have to leave Shanghai at any time. Therefore, after careful consideration and agreement, we held our wedding in the winter of the 26th year. It has been almost three years now, and we already have one child, with another one coming soon. Not to mention that she hasn't participated in any group activities in these three years, even her fluent debating skills have become rusty due to prolonged disuse, not as smooth as before. Looking ahead, it's unlikely that she will ever participate in social activities again because her entire heart and soul have been completely occupied by her family and children. Even if I occasionally invite her to a movie, she always chatters incessantly about family matters and whether the children are warm enough, unable to relax and enjoy herself. People like this, buried in family and children, naturally cannot be expected to become a "leading figure" in society. In Mr. Yan's words, she has "made a sacrifice."</p>
<p>However, my wife and I do not consider this a sacrifice. We believe that a woman managing household affairs and taking care of children at home is also a career, requiring considerable knowledge, just like a man serving in society. If we advocate for saving the nation through our respective roles, then those housewives who manage their homes well are truly fulfilling their responsibilities and should be praised. As the saying goes, excellent citizens come from excellent families. Doesn't this illustrate how important wives are to the family and society! Many virtuous housewives can fill their families with a pleasant atmosphere. On one hand, she can quickly help her husband recover from the fatigue of work or reinvigorate him from career disappointments and frustration. On the other hand, she can provide her children with improved home education, cultivating correct life perspectives and acquiring necessary knowledge from an early age, turning them into healthy citizens in the future. So, although they don't directly serve in society, they actually have the power to promote and transform society. Their contributions are not obvious, but their existence is indispensable to the country!</p>
<p>Initially, I also felt uneasy about my wife being confined to such a small circle within the family, as if I had harmed her career and great future. But now my thinking has changed. I have discovered that her career is managing the family, and her future is educating her children! This statement may not be agreeable to those who advocate for women's participation in politics, but based on my observation, my wife's dedication to her children and family is not due to environmental coercion or merely a sense of responsibility, but rather a completely voluntary act, a manifestation of her natural instincts! She does not consider her current life a sacrifice at all, nor does she complain. On the contrary, she happily takes on these many heavy new tasks. My wife's attitude certainly cannot represent all women, but I believe that Mr. Yan's wife must be her comrade, and there must be many other women who hold the same attitude!</p>
<p>Finally, I hope that Mr. Yan and everyone who shares his feelings need not feel ashamed any longer. You should do your best to assist your wives, sincerely cooperate with them, and use the principle of division of labor to make your families ideal families. Do what you should do. I believe that this is the true essence of equal rights for men and women, and this is what our country and society need from us now!</p>

<h3 id="e95">Grandfather <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>— Jian Ye</p>
<p>My hometown has been bombed again and again, and the news is that our house has been destroyed.</p>
<p>I think of my nearly ninety-year-old grandfather, unable to sleep in the middle of the night, putting on his long gown, and gazing at the stars and moon in the darkness.</p>
<p>The moon is round, and I hear the family next door celebrating their reunion. Oh, today is the Mid-Autumn Festival, a day for reunion.</p>
<p>Grandfather's aged figure flickers among the stars. Sparse, long whiskers trail from his mouth, and his bright eyes emit a light of detachment and kindness, gazing around (perhaps searching for children lost in the darkness?).</p>
<p>Grandfather is the one who supports the whole family, who feeds us, who makes us grow up. Grandfather is stern, yet he is not harsh. Grandfather has a strong body, which is due to his regulated daily life.</p>
<p>You know that Grandfather's life lies in the word "normal." He has normal actions, he has a normal life. He is frugal, he never wastes, he never discards any paper or object. "Utilizing waste" is one of his habits and also one of his cultivations.</p>
<p>But his advantages are not limited to these.</p>
<p>Imagine a person who was born in the Xianfeng era of the late Qing Dynasty, and he does not have any generation gap with the children of the later generations. How rare is this! He reads the newspaper every day, and he maintains his faith—the same faith as 470 million people. With his blurred old eyes, he is hoping for victory, the ultimate victory of the motherland!</p>
<p>However, my hometown has been bombed, and there is no news of Grandfather.</p>

<p>Chapter VIII Capturing Two People</p>
<p>I no longer heard that person speaking, but heard the sound of his leather shoes moving forward at an accelerated pace. I was still walking in the opposite direction, but the speed of my steps and the speed of his steps were exactly inversely proportional. After a while, the sound of his footsteps could no longer be heard. I estimated that he had turned the corner. I suddenly turned around, almost colliding head-on with Little Li, scaring him into taking a step back. I quickly waved my hand, signaling him not to make a sound, and then with large and nimble steps, dashed straight to the turning point. I immediately crouched down and peered towards the entrance of number 556. Zhao Boxiong was also hunching over, pressing his ear against the door to listen. He had obviously suspected that the friend in the room was not his true friend. His body straightened up, and he pondered slightly. Suddenly, his right hand quickly reached into his pocket. Looking from the turning point, even though there was a distance of nearly ten yards and the light was not very bright, I could still see his right hand, when pulled out of his pocket, holding a black pistol! He straightened up again and considered for a moment, then placed his left hand on the doorknob. After his hand gripped the doorknob, it seemed to pause for two or three seconds, hesitating again. In fact, this was not a pause; he was clearly slowly rotating it, trying not to let Hawthorne inside discover his actions outside the door, so that he could suddenly pounce in.</p>
<p>This was a tense moment, and of course I could no longer lie still! I released my steps and rushed straight over. My pistol had already left my pocket. By the time I rushed to the entrance of number 556, Zhao Boxiong had opened the door halfway, his left foot striding into the doorway and his right foot still outside, his right hand holding the gun frozen in an awkward posture, about to raise it but not yet. I quickly raised my pistol, pointing it at the spinal area behind his back, while my lips issued a low and forceful command at the same time.</p>
<p>"Don't move!"</p>
<p>At this moment, a series of giggling laughter pierced my ears. The laughter only increased my excitement. It turned out that the one laughing was Que Sang. Hawthorne was standing inside the doorway, but because Zhao Boxiong's figure was tall and wide, he concealed Que Sang, so I hadn't seen her. (118)</p>

<h3 id="e97">Blood Therapy <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Lü</p>
<p>Almost everyone knows now that for those who have suffered misfortunes and patients with severe bleeding, the most effective treatment is blood transfusion. Blood transfusion involves taking a certain amount of blood from a healthy stranger who has undergone rigorous testing (especially blood type) and injecting it into the patient's body.</p>
<p>However, it has recently been discovered that blood from relatives can cure children suffering from certain diseases and has significant and beautiful effects. In some cases, it can even save lives on the verge of death. Dr. Fiala recently published the results of his experiments. First, he applied blood therapy using parents' blood to children suffering from dangerous complications of scarlet fever, such as pneumonia and meningitis</p>
<p>(whose lives were threatened by death); he used a small amount of their father's or mother's blood for intramuscular injection, and soon, some of them completely recovered their health. In all cases, none developed terrible complications. Therefore, the hospital adopted it as a specific medicine for scarlet fever in pediatrics.</p>
<p>In addition, the same method can achieve the goal for less dangerous measles in children. When a child is infected with measles by his brother or sister, a small injection of the parent's blood is enough to avoid it. This is most useful in many cases, such as when a weak child also has other diseases. In fact, as long as people have had measles once, an antibody will always exist in the blood: but the special effectiveness of blood from relatives, precisely what it is that can cure scarlet fever and measles, is not fully known today.</p>

<p>— Plum Blossom Pavilion Master</p>
<p>"Sheng, Dan, Jing, Mo, Chou" are the main roles in an opera troupe. Although the role of the clown is relatively minor, his use is very extensive. Except for a few plays that only have Sheng and Dan, "Fen He Wan Wu Jia Po..." the rest, whether literary or martial plays, large or small plays, old or new plays, can be said to have the clown's share. There is a saying in the opera troupe called "No clown, no play". From this saying, you can know that the clown's position in Beijing opera is not minor, and it is very important.</p>
<p>Books say that the character "Chou" is an abbreviated writing of the character "酉"; and Lin Wushan, a famous Ping opera performer in the early days, said that Chou means "ugly." I remember that he published the following passage before his death:</p>
<p>"Chou means ugly. The one who plays the ugly role, the best is to not be ugly but ugly, the middle is to be ugly but not ugly, and the worst is to be both ugly and ugly."</p>
<p>At that time, the second young master Yuan Baocun very much agreed with this interpretation, and even boasted that his own clown plays were qualified to be "not ugly but ugly." (The young master is good at Kunqu and Huang opera is famous for clown plays. The role of Tang Biaoli in Shen Tou Ci Tang is unrestrained and cold, unparalleled at the time. It is said that he learned from the famous clown Ke Xiushan). I will not mention who is good and who is bad among the deceased clowns. I might as well talk about a few who are still making a living on the red carpet.</p>
<p>In my personal opinion, Xiao Changhua is a typical clown figure. His performance on stage is not only good in manner, but also has a naturally good voice, clear and bright, sweet and tasty. It is really enjoyable to listen to. His plays are best known for the square towel clown (such as Jiang Gan in Qun Ying Hui, Tang Qin in Yi Peng Xue). The shopkeeper in Lian Sheng Dian, the doctor who asks for medicine, Wang Banxian in Qing Shi Shan, Qiao Xi in Gan Lu Si, Chong Gongdao in Nü Qi Jie, and Zhang Biego in Wu Pen Ji are all his famous masterpieces. Although he is old now, his spirit is still very good, and his performance is still the same as it was more than ten years ago. Ci Ruiquan is also a well-known veteran actor. His roles as the peddler in "Shuang Ling Ji", Sai Xishi in "Neng Ren Si", Chong Gongdao in "Nü Qi Jie", the old soldier in "Zhu Lian Zhai", and Jia Gui in "Fa Men Si" are all very exciting. It is a pity that he lacks some elegance in playing the square towel clown. The reason why he cannot be on par with Xiao Changhua is because of this reason. Although Ma Fulu is a popular actor, his skills are really not flattering. He is glib and useless. However, his cross-dressing as the old woman in "De Yi Yuan" is quite decent. Ru Fuhui is Xiao Changhua's apprentice, and his skills are really good; Jia Gui in Fa Men Si; Zhang Biego in Wu Pen Ji: Tang Qin in Yi Peng Xue, Jiang Gan in Qun Ying Hui, all follow the style of Mr. Xiao, but he suffers from being too short. Cao Ergeng is very good and his speech is also very clear. Cheng Yanqiu has always valued him very much; his father is the famous Kunqu master Cao Xinquan, who wrote a lot in his later years and made considerable contributions to Kunqu opera. Unfortunately, he is now deceased. In addition, I also appreciate two people, one is the talented Jia Duocai, and the other is the rising star Sun Shengwu.</p>

<p>— Meng Bai</p>
<p>The Stars Drama Society recently performed for the first time at the Lafayette Theater, with a total of three plays.</p>
<p>The first play is "The Persecuted" written by Wu Tian. It is indeed very valuable to perform it in Shanghai at this time and place. Li Li's Amao and Hua Ying's Cuihua were quite successful, but in some places the lines were not very familiar. Mo Yi's Chen Sanzhen looked like an old man, but his body could be lifted a little bit. Lü Ping's Da Jinzi and Gu Yue's Yu Zui both fully demonstrated the style of Shanghai playboys. Several climaxes were very good.</p>
<p>The second one is "Marlin". Li Li's Shi Haoren fully demonstrated his personality. Luo Ka's Manager Jia's makeup was not very good. Ling Ping's Wu Huang, Jie Fei's Wan Fangmang, Meng Qian's Bei Yi, and Mo Yi's Wang Pinsan were all quite successful. Meimei's Ma</p>
<p>The third is the comedy "Fiancés". It is very difficult to handle a comedy with four actors, but they performed very successfully. The plot is very compact and always grasps the psychology of the audience. Qi Zi performed the best, and Qiu He's landlord was also very realistic. Yan Ping and Peng Fei were both mediocre.</p>
<p>Other aspects such as lighting, effects, and makeup were also quite good, which are unmatched by other amateur drama societies, especially in decoration. In short, the first public performance of the society was able to achieve such good results, which are all due to the daily efforts of the members. I hope that the society can continue to work hard and its future will definitely be bright.</p>

<p>The State of Qi was strong and close to Lu. Lu was the hometown of Confucius. He first served as the chief of Zhongdu under Duke Ding, and then as the Minister of Justice. Duke Jing of Qi was afraid that Lu would be well governed. His minister Li Zu first suggested to Duke Ding to have a meeting at Jiagu, and used military force to coerce him, but he was eventually defeated by Confucius's righteousness. Qi then presented beautiful women and music to Duke Ding of Lu, who enjoyed them and did not attend court for three days. Confucius knew that it was impossible to do anything, so he abandoned his position and left.</p>
<p>Yang Hu, whose name was Huo, was a family minister of the senior official Jisun of Lu. Shao Zhengmao was a senior official of Lu, famous throughout the country, but Confucius executed him for disrupting the government after being the prime minister for seven days. Confucius said that Shao Zhengmao was "rebellious and dangerous in his heart, eccentric and tight in his actions, hypocritical and eloquent in his words, and agreeable to falsehood." Yang Huo then plotted to rebel against the country. When the matter failed, he fled to Qi. Qi did not accept him, so he fled to Jin. He eventually helped Kuai Kui seize the throne of the Duke of Wei, and was ridiculed by later generations.</p>

<p>Ci Ruiquan loves to watch foreign films. He said that the reason he loves to watch foreign films is: "This is like listening to Beijing opera. Watching Chinese films is like watching Shanghai-style operas, and watching foreign films is completely our stuff!" Someone saw him in the corner of the cinema, wearing a sweat towel around his waist, with a funny expression, not inferior to Chaplin.</p>

<p>In addition to raising medical dogs, Song Dezhu also likes to raise pigeons. A year ago, there were almost forty pigeons of various colors, but he loves the iron-winged type the most. It is said that: "When it flies, it really looks like a big butterfly." He does not have a fixed time for releasing pigeons. Even in strong winds and storms, he has to show off his skills, so now there are only more than ten left.</p>

<p>In a certain year, Mei Wan Hua and Yang Xiao Lou performed Chang Ban Po in Tianjin. When Mei's wife jumped into the well, Zhao Yun would usually grab her yellow cloak. On that day, Mei tied his belt too tightly, and he could not grab it several times. After the scene, Mei said to people: "This job in the opera business is really not easy!"</p>

<p>The martial arts actor Zhang Delu has very good martial arts skills. He likes to drink, and he can drink more than ten catties at a time. He is very good at guessing fingers. In the past, he was known as the "King of Boxing and Wine" in the acting world. I wonder if he still has such a large capacity now?</p>
<p>(Seventeen)</p>
<p>Zhang Rongkui is a rare remaining senior old actor after Lao Tan. A few years ago, he only took one hundred yuan for a package at the Grand Stage. One day, Zhao Ruquan, the backstage manager, wanted him to perform a play called Zhan Taiping during the daytime on Sunday. He refused on the grounds that he "could not sing." Later, he reluctantly agreed to perform it once, and the package was increased from one hundred yuan to one hundred and eighty yuan, but he then cheaply spread the news the next day. He said: "My package is only worth one hundred yuan!" For a time, he was known as a fool.</p>
