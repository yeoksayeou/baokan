<p>社評</p>
<h3>歐戰時之德國與遠東</h3>
<p>歷史所沿襲的傳統，恩怨所激發的感情，更以趨捨於不同的信仰之中，復以權衡於不同的利害之中，人羣因此種種原由，見解竟不能歸於齊一。這種不齊一的現象，幾乎是先天的，甚至是永遠的。德國有德國所堅持的見解，英國有英國所堅持的見解；惟其堅持，於是交戰。同樣亦在戰爭之中的中國，堅持着國族非獨立自由不可；獨立自由受了脅迫非抗戰不可；但是超過了國族獨立自由的限度，則以爲如英國與德國者，縱使見解不同、，殊無堅持必要；這是中國的見解。在這一見解之下，中國當然熱望英德兩國戰爭的及早適可而止；明知這一熱望之徒然，然而始終如此誠摯的熱望着！</p>
<p>根據了英國所堅持的見解，演繹至於英國對遠東問題所取的態度，我們很容易列舉今日以前的種種事跡，說明其矛盾；英國對於每一矛盾，自有其自己原諒的理由；確是，其間有一部份是應該予以原諒的。</p>
<p>根據了德國所堅持的見解，應用之於遠東，則微妙之甚。不但逐一問題，有不止一方面的看法；且於同一問題，應以其不同之時機而作不同的看法。時期的遞進，機緣的轉變，我們深信德國對於遠東一切的見解，亦必因時期與機緣而正在相應演化之中。目前所期待其演化的，當然不是期待以行動，形格勢禁，至少在目前談不到此：而是如何由目前的一切，發爲正直而明確的表示。往事不遑贅論。目前有逈不同於往昔的：往昔需要搖旗吶喊，張揚聲勢，既望不戰而勝，亦望有助於戰時；目前眞刀眞槍，出死入生，對於作戰無益的在所擯斥，對於戰後有害的允必遏止。往昔任何方面對於英國，或削弱其些微力量，或牽制其些微活動，或搖撼其些微威信，皆於德國不謂無益；目前在遠東，實際上沒有任何國族，任何力量，乃因德國不與委蛇而幫助英國，竟予德國以有效的打擊，或因德國甘言厚幣而幫助德幽，竟予英國以有效的打擊。進一步說，即使在遠東予英國以何種打擊，但並不能影響及於英國在北海與地中海以及在近東的英國戰鬥力，亦即絲毫無助於德國的對英作戰；足以予英國以有效打擊的，有之，却不在遠東。往昔德國在遠東有工商業利益，這是德國製造飛機坦克車的一部分財源，而絕非依賴了飛機坦克車始得享有此項利益；目前此項利益因歐戰而有停頓之觀，至於往後，不論歐戰結果如何，無須飛機坦克車保護的遠東工商業利益，乃爲德國在無論何種情况下所更應竭力經營的吧！德國所應經營而能大量供給的、無疑的，惟獨立自由而復興中的中國，最能彼此適應吧！往昔德法對立，德國對法國當然利害衝突，更談不到如何策動法國；目前異是，我人雖不以爲法國貝當政府的遠東政策乃惟德國之馬首是瞻；我人同情於貝當政府，厚望於貝當政府，故不作如是想；然我人每聞貝當政府在遠東逐步退讓的消息，總以爲他所得到的鼓勵不夠維持其勇氣，而最能鼓勵其勇氣的，無可諱言是德國。在遠東問題中，德國爲他人造機會，而不作正直明確的表示又爲他人所取爲國際的工具；何以德國迄今猶未以爲不盡慷他入之慨！</p>
<p>我人深信德國對遠東的見解正在演化之中，如德國報界諸君履次在滬在渝所談，如大使館柯德君隔昨在上海所談，又如最近柏林『德國人民經濟雜誌』論文所根據，，無不予我人以良好印象，充實了我人所深信；同時，我人還恐德國人士千慮一失的：在對英戰爭時期，易由感情而錯覺，以爲凡是不利於英國的，皆德國所有益，皆德國所快意，皆德國所樂予贊許。試察前論，必知對於遠東問題獨不然！</p>
<h3>美將派海陸空軍　增強菲律濱防務　英美談判獲圓滿結果　新加坡完成防禦步驟</h3>

<p>華盛頓　美國務卿赫爾、昨日在情報會議中宜稱、關於英、美所進行租借英國根據地之談判、現時並無新穎消息、足資報吿、據消息靈通人士指陳、此項談判、已瀕於結束云、（三十一日海通電）</p>

<p>歐戰叢談（一）</p>
<h3>邱吉爾　少年的羅曼史</h3>
<p>這次歐戰到本月三日，忽忽一週年了，最後勝利誰屬，尙在未定之天。哥倫比亞大學校長勃脫勒博士曾經說過；「這次戰爭是世界大戰。誰勝誰負，足以決定兩種文明，兩種生活，兩種政府和社會的理想。其結局如果不利於我人，世界大局便會退化數十年；如於我人有利，我們便可恢復眞正的自由主義，以領導世界的進步與和平。」本報爲使讀者深切明瞭這次歐戰的實况起見，曾經絡續發表過「歐戰背景」和「歐戰實錄」兩種譯文。但是近代的全面戰爭，波及範圍旣廣，，方面亦甚複雜，歐美各國記者所搜集的材料，美不勝收。本報爰再取其精華，譯成二十餘篇，附以照片多幀，總名曰「歐戰叢談」。其中取材，有的保存已久，有的剛纔接到，一以客觀態度，直接間接揭發歐洲戰局實情爲本。目錄之可先行披露者；英國之部有（一）邱吉爾少年的羅曼史（二）戰爭爆發前夕英國的民間生活（三）邱吉爾的美國母親；德國之部有（一）少年希特勒的潦倒（二）德國七年來總動員的分析（三）德國軍費的浩大（四）希特勒的凱旋（五）希特勒的私人生活；法國之部有（一）巴黎陷落之日（二）從巴黎到波爾多（三）貢巴臬森林中的悲劇（四）「維希老人」的苦衷；其他之部有（一）各國淪陷區域的近况（二）歐美各國的間諜恐慌（三）挪威陷落的內幕（四）地中海戰局概述（五）「阿爾脫馬克」被襲擊記（六）華沙末日記（七）捷克人的消極抵抗（八）奧國作家亡命記（九）甘地致希特勒書（十）美國備戰概况。各篇譯文逐日發表，共間如發現新穎材料，隨時挿入，俾讀者得窺全豹。</p>
<p>下面是第一篇，叙述英國戰時首相邱吉爾少年時代的羅曼史，所謂「羅曼史」是英文Romance的譯音。</p>
<p>號稱英國「鐵漢」的邱吉爾首相，出身貴族，祖及父均任顯宦，母親是美國富人的令媛，容貌昳麗，才華絕世，家庭環境可說是一門富貴了。然而他並不沾有公子哥兒的習氣，自童年，而成人，而入仕，處處表現他具有過人的活力，富於冒險心，不避危難，勇於任事，確屬生有異禀，非常人所能幾及。</p>
<p>綜計他從事政治生活以來，在內閣之中，曾九遷其職：做過保守黨閣員，也會充任自由黨閣員。其間雖有一時退休，然而他在野之日，仍舊保持着邁進的精神，百折不撓，這是他獨到之處。</p>
<p>他曾當過新聞記者，著作家，軍事家。軍事方面他是三考出身；文學上的修養和成就，更爲一般從政者所不及。英國自狄士累利首相以來，能以文字名世的閣老，邱吉爾一人而已。至於他平日談吐之妙，演講的動人，幾乎有些像「出自異人傳授」。</p>
<p>上次世界大戰時，他曾在法國前綫指揮一大隊步兵；又有一個時期，他曾醉心軍事航空，自己駕駛飛機。解甲之後，他又抽空著作，成書多卷；四十歲時所作的風景水彩畫，曾爲內家所激賞。他生活變化多端，精力旺盛，不媿爲不列顚「浪漫派帝國主義者的典型人物」了。</p>
<p>在希特勒埋頭苦幹的時期中，英國執政諸公憤憤如夢。邱吉爾這個「孤老頭兒」却是「善觀氣色」，一個人在那裏大聲疾呼，現在他的「預言」都應騐了。他爲朝野頓促出山，領導準備不充份的英國人民作戰，在他果然是及時報國，然而看到他少年時代所過的錦繡生活，燦爛日子，眞有不勝今昔之感了。</p>
<p>邱吉爾童年時，其父跟着馬爾巴羅公服官愛爾蘭，四歲時卽離去。其母爲紐約富商裘羅姆之女（詳見後文「邱吉爾的美國母親」。）一八八〇年，邱吉爾年七歲，預備入學，那時人家都說他是個「淘氣的小孩」</p>
<p>他最初進的學校是慕仿英國貴族式的伊頓學校，一有過失，鞭笞立至。挨了兩年，天天把望着早日出來。後來因爲體弱多病，爲便利醫生照顧起見，轉學至勃萊登地方兩位女敎師所辦的學校，那裏一片柔和慈祥之氣，與第一校眞不可同日而語了。</p>
<p>十二歲入哈洛學校，考試時，他對於拉丁文的試題，繳了白卷，但是校長就他一般學力來看終於准他入學。邱吉爾追述在校淸形說：「我叫斯賓塞邱吉兩，第一個字母爲S名次排在很後的一排，倒數是第三名。那最後兩名又都因生病輟學了。那時正是一八八七年，父親　道爾夫邱吉爾勛爵雖已辭去衆議院議長，及財政大巨之職，在政界中却仍握着勢力。因之常有許多來訪的人，竚立學校階沿，看我列隊走過；我不時聽到他們竊竊私議說，「什麼，他竟是全校掮榜！」</p>
<p>在校一年，別的學生多喜歡讀拉丁文和希臘文，他自以爲有自知之明，祇讀英文，因之打了個很好的根基。後來他考取了哈洛學校陸軍班，自以爲一半要歸功於運道。他說：「我們都知道考時要默畫一張地圖。我在隔夜作最後預備時，寫了許多地圖的名字放在帽子裏，然後摸出了一張「紐西蘭」就拚命把紐西蘭地理記住。翌日考卷上第一個題目居然是「試繪紐西蘭地圖」。</p>
<p>邱吉爾從小歡喜作兵戲，所收集的玩偶兵多至一千五百個，組成步兵一師，騎兵一旅，有一天，他父親去參觀他指揮這些玩偶兵作戰，有二十分鐘之久。臨了，他父親問他是吾願意入睦軍。邱吉爾立刻答道「願意」，於是這玩偶兵就轉移了他一生的命運。嗣後他的敎育一以考入桑特赫斯地方的陸軍大學爲目標，終究入了該校騎兵科。他回想學校生活，除對於劍術曾獲錦標之外，其他多屬平凡。</p>
<p>他在陸軍大學，一切重新學起，從前荒廢了的拉丁文，法文，數學，都不發生影響。他視騎馬一道格外深切有味。他主張一班做父兄的，尤其富有之家，「不要以金錢給兒子，寗可給他們馬匹」。眼睛一霎，又是畢業時期了。向來逃不掉「掮榜」的邱吉爾，這次大考，在一百五十學生中，居然名列第八·一八九四年十二月，學成回家，已經有資格担任軍官了。</p>
<p>此後短短的五年，毫無所事，然而在他一生中倒是一個趣味的中心，所經歷的一切眞不愧花樣百出。他二十一歲入胡塞斯騎兵隊，受後補軍官訓練。各種課程較之在校時嚴格數倍。終日學習騎術：上馬，下馬，絕馳，緩步，跳欄，奔踨，不一而足。邱吉爾本來就愛好騎術，至此尤覺樂此不疲。</p>
<p>翌年春，胡塞斯騎隊預備入秋塡防印度，軍官們都給假處理雜務。邱吉爾豢有五匹駿騎，就利用這個時期，大玩其馬球之戲，那時英國政商領袖多以賽馬爲大事，熱鬧情形，哄動整個倫敦。這正投邱吉爾之所好，差不多有會必到，盡情玩了一個暢快。</p>
<p>在這假期中，有一件事他却受了個敎訓。據他自己記載道：「某星期杪，我以陸軍少尉資格被邀列席歡讌王太子盛會，自是覺得極大榮幸。我很明白，必須準時出席，舉止且須文雅大方—總之把一切美德顯出來罷了。不料我到達之時，賓主早就齊集客廳，除我而外，人數似乎是十三。王室對於十三這數目，不願馬虎，這是大家都知道的。太子明白拒絕入席。他依照原定八時半準時蒞臨，現在已經九點缺十二分了。在大客廳中，站着這位盛怒的貴客，一方面却來了我這個人家另眼看待的年輕小夥子。我覺得很尷尬，只得囁嚅了幾句道兼話，帶着鞠了一躬。太子很嚴厲的斥責道：「溫斯登，難道在你隊伍裏，他們不敎你遵守時間麼？」我眞覺得惶恐萬分！我們兩人並肩走入餐廳，坐下來剛巧十四人。後來這位宅心仁厚的太子，對我說了幾句表示好意的話，使我釋然於懷。」他從此之後便竭力保持遵守時間的美德。</p>
<p>胡塞爾騎隊一千二百人，搭了運輸艦由蘇桑普頓出發，經過了二十三天的航行，纔到達孟買。</p>
<p>在印度從軍，餉金和待遇均較國內優厚，軍官的飲食衣着起居，都有侍役照管。邱吉爾一隊駐紥却加羅爾有三年之久。</p>
<p>一八九六年冬，他二十二歲轉眼就將過去，求知之念大熾，便寫信向母親要了許多歷史，哲學，和經濟書籍，每日利用白畫休息的光陰，勤讀咀嚼，虛心接受，如是者兩年。然後返國休假三月。是時印邊帕纏族人叛變。他本來蓄願要實地參觀作戰情形已久，便要求上峯，准他隨同野戰隊三旅出征，同時並担任倫敦前鋒報隨軍記者，他母親更和倫敦每日電報接洽，把他的通信按期發表。</p>
<p>邱吉爾回到邦加羅爾，在車站一問諾希拉（野戰軍總司令部在所地）的行程要二千零二十八英里，不覺一呆，暗想印度原來這樣大！在大熱天氣中，坐了五天火車到鐵路終站，再坐四十英里馬車，始赴司令部報到。</p>
<p>英軍第一旅初次和土人交綏，一更間傷亡官兵的四十員，馬匹甚多。第二旅馳來增援</p>
<p>翌晨，第二旅開始作戰，人數約千二百名，分三路作扇形進攻，邱吉爾編入在中路，策馬絕駛至山谷最遠的一端。中途他帶了一隊印度兵去襲取山邊一個小村。他所記的當時的情景如下：「我把坐騎交給土人，領了印兵攀登山邊。中午的太陽，炙熱如焚。除了山上面放了幾槍外，一切倒還安靜。十一點鐘左右，我忽然奇怪起來，爲什麼看不見我們的軍隊。二三小時前，一千二百人的大隊正在進行，現在好像已被山谷吞噬了似的。我年少好事，惟恐不出亂子。居然壞事了！」沒有隔多久，邱吉爾和一隊印度兵，奉令撤退。突然間刀光彈丸，漸逼漸近敵人由上而下，看看就到脚跟前。八個印度兵極力開火還擊，結果兩個被殺，三個受傷。幸而一位軍官帶同幾個兵士到來，幫同大家把受傷的兵士搶救回來。邱吉爾接着描寫當時情形道：「該軍官中彈了。他手下的四個兵士把他舁走。這時候五六個帶大刀的帕纏人從旁邊閃出來。四個兵也不顧傷人從担架上滚下來，脫身便逃。為首的帕纏人奔到担架之旁，提出大刀向那垂斃的軍官速劈三四刀。我見狀忘卻了一切，誓欲撲殺此獠。持槍瞄準開放，一槍，不見動靜，二槍，也沒有結果，三槍，不知道有否打中，只見那個土著倒退了三四碼路，從岩上跌滾下去。這時候槍聲仍密，我向四週看看，一個自己人也不見，便拔步拚命的奔，子彈從各方面飛來。我卒於奔到一個小丘。我們的印度兵早已佔據了一個低丘！片刻之後，我就跟他們在一起了。」</p>
<p>未幾，土著不支而退。我軍奉令將谷中村舍林木，毀成平地。每次進攻一村。損失英籍官軍二三名，和印度兵十五名至二十名。作戰兩星期，始奏凱回營。是年冬天，我便以倫敦每日電報所發表的通信作藍本，寫成第一部著作。耶穌聖誕節後，我把原稿寄往倫敦，由我的母親售與某書局出版，名曰The　Malakand　Field　Force，極為讀者所歡迎。（未完）</p>

<p>洋米市目連續兩朝奔騰後、米糧評價委員會不顧上海存米情况、遷就事實、只知顧惜貨主身本、不問大衆生活艱難、特均放高二元、囤戶投機愈覺其振振有辭、原包回籠、不在限內、更使抬價不息無術、一時競相購囤、爾放我收、各價飛騰、頃刻之間、悉到評價、質言之、卽漲起兩元光景、收盤一號陳西貢及暹邏爲六十一元半、新尖六十元零八角、二號五十九元、火絞六十一元、二號西貢前日開六十八元、後喊七十元未妥、昨乃開價卽爲七十一元半、繼自二元至二元半、比前開出之六十八元則漲有四元半矣、小絞七十元漲二元四角、二號暹邏自七十元零五角大至七十二元半亦漲起三元、計成交有五百多噸、現米本街心虛爭辦外、大多爲囤戶吸進、而成交則有一萬三四千包之多、</p>
<p>糯米到貨旣寥、銷塲突旺、不獨糕舖與飯担因見米市飛漲、預爲備積、且有大戶吸囤、一時形成供不敷求貨主都以奇貨自居、作客不以價貴退縮、售價較之前市統升三四元之巨、竟開金溧特元六十七八元、常丹貨亦須六十五六元、而香港特元與國糯並爲六十七八元、普通六十五六元、次至砶元六十一二元、</p>

<h3>金述融評</h3>
<p>— 聖凱瓊</p>
<p>外滙轉緊何為</p>
<p>近兩週的法幣暗市滙價，又在盤旋下挫，美金由五元五九三七五以上，跌至五元半以下，月底見五元二八一二五；英金亦由三便士七〇一二五，降至三便士五九三七五。黃金市價亦被激漲至六千二百元以外。</p>
<p>影響匯市內基本因素，似可謂出於越南緊張局勢所促成，至謂財部又要改訂商業匯率，僅能認爲謠言。按財部自一九三九年訂定商業匯率以來，出口商人曾迭請財部將七便士的商用匯率放棄，改訂與暗市水準較折之價。可是當局以爲如與暗市接近，未免波動頻繁，漲跌不一。商業滙率一旦與暗市接近，將時加改訂，對於出口商人固未見有利，而對國家統制出口貿易徵集出口外匯的工作，反多妨碍，故卒在一年多的時間內掛定七便士。但在一年之後，方依照統計數字所顯示的結果，及環境上的變化，重行訂定四便士半的滙率。現在四便士半的匯奉對於出口貿易與徵集外滙的情形，尙不能從統計上發見任何情况，而環境上亦未有重大的變化，若謂商用滙率將改爲三便士，母乃神經過敏！要知商業匯率雖可隨時更改，但「隨時」是有條件限制的，最要的是在確知它有妨出口貿易與外匯徵集時，方能隨時更改哩。</p>
<p>至於越南局勢，市上一再謠傳日軍在上海防登陸，但日軍始終還未踏上越南土地一步，同時目下中國政府除希望越南不被日所利用以外，基本的政策在抵抗侵略，故僅陳兵越滇邊境，並採取不問越南政府態度如何，如若日軍開入越南，則中國反侵略的戰爭卽在越南境內發生。越南局勢雖嚴重，尙不能知對於中國的利害如何。投機者在七月份以三·八便士以上及六元左右的行市購進八月期滙，因綠時會，利用商業滙率的改訂與上海防軍問題，是獲利了。現在又想利用越南局勢扒進外滙，以期此方面不利的發展，得發國難財。</p>
<h3>從五月發現最高價回跌迄今　昨日金價約得其中　　—最高見六千二百廿元—</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤、買風重振、高價疊出、收盤已出六千二百元大關、此以滙市報緊經營者豈肯放棄多頭良機、加碼購進、乃早有之準備、雖其中獲利及浮多時來了結、而影響仍微、查本年五月六日金價最高曾見七千二百五十元、旋以歐戰緊張、荷比停戰、反動驟起、逐步回跌至七月五日、最低價爲四千九百界十元、至昨市晨開爲六千零六十元、證券幫金號首扒、立卽升達六千一百二十元、後錢兌業略出、回低二三十元、嗣聞外滙緊勢俏俐、銀號金號猛抬、不久至六千二百廿元頂盤、斯時散戶等均進、買風頗熾、收盤前稍挫、而結果仍爲六千二百十元收盤、比上日軋漲一百七十五元之鉅、若就五月份發現最高價回跌以來、昨日金價的得其中、午後週三無市、半日交易尙旺、約四千餘兩、銀樓飾金終則掛大十元、海關金等仍平、</p>
<p>烚赤漲一七五元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初開人心頗佳、金號首先抬價買入、進錢兌業五十兩、爲六千零六十元、比隔昨做高二十五元、嗣因外滙報緊、買氣愈盛、證券幫銀號爭先收吸、立漲六十元、證券幫進銀號十兩、昂爲六千一百二十元、旋錢兌業忽來拋空、一度會回至六千零九十元、此後買風復起、金號及銀號幫又來搜羅、且加斯時港幫從中活動、遂再升九十元、金號進證券幫三十兩、升爲六千一百八十元、後滙市止緊趨平、一時稍起回風、金號銀號幫反來叶賣、遂回低至六千百三十五元、十一時許外滙復吿走緊、一時檯面上買風又振、銀號幫吸收允力、竟衝出六千一百元關、見六千一百二十元高價、午刻某錢兌業空頭見高加碼、回跌三十元、卒因散戶買意興奮、故收市尙有六千二百十元、結果比上日軋漲一百七十五元、收後突然傳美艦駛至太平洋之說、故引起相當賣風、金號銀號幫在塞、最後竟退達六千一百四十元、午後塲外情勢尙穩、六千一百七十元曾有成交、半天一百六十元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、服烚赤較高十數元、收進减低三十餘元、現標金照掛牌金低五六十元光景、均鮮做開、</p>
<p>飾金赤褂大十元　銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、初時大同行仍懸六百二十元、迨十時許掛大十元、此後則無變動、計大同行改懸六百三十元、新同行與上相仿、收進减低三十元光景、</p>
<h3>英美金鎊　大漲四元</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市况、烚赤漲風又起、英美金鎊、各大漲四元、英金票仍有人需要、市價略挺、美金票一度高至十八元八角四分、後以市傳美艦有一部駛抵太平洋之說、會回降至十八元七角、午後又高至十八元七角八分、終漲三角六分、香港票頗有需要、價漲五分、此外如新加坡票及安南·羅比·坎拿大·菲列濱等票、均不乏需要、市價一致挺漲、日金票漲勢未衰、市價繼續挺進、晚市高至一元八角二分、比上日續漲七分、朝鮮票需要亦殷、晚市續高至一元一角四分、</p>
<h3>八月份匯劃存息</h3>
<p>—每千元四元半—　上海銀行業聯合準備委員會、訂定八月份同業匯劃存款息、爲每千元四元五角、（卽合月息四厘半）、較七月份减低一元五角、</p>
<h3>中國新角票　票面之小子暗記號</h3>
<p>中國銀行新發行之一角及二角輔幣券、式樣已詳本報、查中國銀行此次所印之角票、紙張好、印刷精、且均有小字暗記、茲略記之、一角面正面北平天壇之右面、樹林上有「1940」字樣、天壇之左、右階上有「中國銀行」四字、二角票正面萬里　城右面、城垣山中間、有「中國銀行」、「大東唐霖坤彫刻」及「TLK」字樣、城外山地上、有「1940」及「TLK」字樣、</p>
<h3>證券　內債漲風　再接再厲</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨市漲風竟　見猛烈、各種均已衝出七月十六七兩日連息之最高價、人氣奮興、籌碼枯竭、一時無出其倉、賣戶頗有無貨可交者、乃向對方情商借貸，此種情形、初有發現、又爲多方所利用、頭寸充裕之家、愈覺機會難得、繼續吸收、雖金子一再狂漲、債市毫不爲動、多頭加碼、空方抵補、一時紛起、可見其根本原因、實大戶投資漸見踴躍、故債市前途仍係與時俱進之必然現象、昨日上午初開平平、同康聯和恒孚買進、信孚稍有結出、入後大康成忽有大量進胃、市價由疲轉挺、午後買氣驟盛、同康聯和不斷收買、順泰鴻大聯益吸收亦勁、益昌信昌天豐需要亦殷、其中多方加碼爲多、空方抵補者少、恒康永康或入甲出戊、或入甲出丙、擇利而行、久豐怡泰仍有拋售、丙種頓穿出三元關、乙種穿出六元、甲種穿出二元、戊種亦逼近三元、爲付息後之新高價、更衝出七月間連息最高價、欣欣向榮、方興未艾、實近數月來之好氣象也、市價結果、續好數角至一元許、丁種因下午未暇做開、故祗好一角五分、成交數目的共一百五六十萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交中國銀行股五十股、價爲六十五元半、</p>
<p>倫敦三十日（週五）電、今日中國外債及遠東英商各公司股票掛牌行市、均吿平滯、行情槪無變動、</p>
<h3>紗花　紗市積重難返　存貨既厚出路閉塞</h3>
<p>紗市仍在盤旋之境、趨勢平庸、但外滙被見下瀉、然紗市未能隨之上升、此因存貨濃厚、二則交通艱雞、運輸不暢、紗銷出路大遭打擊、所以人心求受刺激、市面乃呈趦趄之狀態也、</p>
<p>現紗晨開、人氣平澹、因紗銷甚窄、且浮多依然拋出、二十支　馬開價爲九百六十元、旋聞美滙改縮、黃金昂騰、搶帽子之輩、又復活動、一致撈進、由允百六十元直漲至九百七十二元、惟　面叫喊雖緊張、然新買者仍寥寥無幾、實則銷塲欠缺、又見下降至九百七十元零五角收盤、查半日間成交統計一千九百五十五包、行情二十支雙馬跌五元、今日有棉紗三百三十件運香港、茲將各幫口買去之額量、分列如左、</p>
<h3>惠司登洋花　鴻章獨進百件</h3>
<p>現棉情形又入冷靜之途、不過滙票雖縮、廠方因紗銷出路閉塞、對於原料採辦殊澹、所以成父不旺、不過有一部份心思看昂、然新棉狀况頗佳、本日現棉僅鴻章廠進惠司登一百件、價爲二百零八元送廠云、</p>
<p>另訊外棉市價、紐約棉市、晨初先因投機者之購買、及後因華爾街之堅定與紐奧倫期幫之購買、結果收盤價格、較之上日漲起五六磅音、印度昨日連同預測又漲三羅比半、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、昨日又呈活躍之狀、中日廠商俱懷購意、蓋因廠中存底並不甚豐、且印美棉求向洋行訂購已久、目前兵險率奇高、且於訂成單後、立將全部貨款付淸之說、將來究能於何日到埠、俱屬困難也、故廠方卽在市搜　、市况頓呈活躍、按照此種情勢、現貨價格、將大呈活躍也、</p>
<h3>疋頭　障礙重重　棉布貨運　若斷若續</h3>
<p>布市外弛內緊、蓋以黃金猛漲、人心倍受刺激、惟各路裝貨、若斷若續、阻礙重重、存貨壅塞、致使人心又趨惶惑、故貨價乍跌乍漲、呈盤旋局面、結果每疋微漲二角、本街兩路車運雖通、惟數量限制甚嚴、粵港幫南洋幫因滙兌關係、需要稍增、昨辦漂布粗布色布斜紋三百餘件、浙間幫辦色布、色斜等一百餘件、烟台幫辦粗布等一百餘件、本街成交各布六百餘件、</p>
<p>東布因實銷呆帶、中檔細布續跌每疋二角半左右、惟以金價頻漲、散戶心思交易尙稱熱鬧、故龍頭細布市盤高峯時刻過三十二元八角、收盤爲三十二元七角、反較前日升起二角、四君子嗶嘰每碼九角三分二厘半、平穩無榮辱、</p>
<p>疋頭出口、三十一日運威海衞二百二十五件、運烟台九十五件、運香港一百七十件、</p>
<h3>糖市　洋糖續漲</h3>
<p>昨糖市因外　再緊、故洋糖續漲公會劃盤、　四粗白六月十日到七十七九八角、七月三十一日到七十八元、升五角、轉口貨新到者六十三元至六十三元五角、升五角、荷赤　嘜九月六日到交者六十四元、九月二十七日到交者六十三元三角、升五角、太古B嘜車白七十七元、升一元、DY嘜七十三元四角至七十三元八角、升八角、HX喀七十三元六角、亦升八角、</p>

<h3>海關懸球警告　颶風向滬疾進　風向能否變更今日分曉</h3>
<p>太平洋新　風進行方向至堪注意、已誌昨報、茲聞新颶風、已過琉球島、向中國南海疾進、昨據海關接天文台報吿、已進至北緯二十五度、東經一百二十一度、風力範圍、竟有六十至一百二十海里、風向爲北北西及北西、觀察天文台風圖、已抵福州洋面、現正</p>
<p>向大戢洋猛烈進展、本市有遭襲擊可能、故海關已於昨日下午二時四十分（海關鐘）在鐘樓屋頂旗桿上、高懸預測颶風信號黑球一枚、警吿浦江內船隻預防、又據航海人員云、照此風向不變、恐今日有抵木市之處、預定今日出口之太古海江輪、怡和洋行阜生輪、均往香港、能吾準時出口、須看</p>
<p>今日風勢而定、並有香港來滬之美國總統輪船公司批亞士總統號郵船、及渣華郵船公司新郵船芝楂連加號、均預計明晨（二日）抵滬、此次颶風是否影響到埠日期、昨日該兩公司尙無表示、故確定時間須待明晨始曉、</p>

<h3>滬港防復航時　英法開始接洽　西江輪抵海防日內駛貢　法日交涉德義預聞其事</h3>
<p>滬越航輪、自宣吿暫行中斷後、上海英商輪隻、均停止駛往海防、改航香港海口兩處、但據消息靈通方面稱、上海與海防間航運、預料短期內卽可恢復、</p>
<p>英法談判關於滬越航運一旦中斷、不僅行商與乘客兩感不便、卽輪公司當局、亦蒙其不利、香港上海兩地英國利益、更遭遇打擊、據外人方面稱、英國當局業已開始與法國方面、談判關於港越航運恢復問題、雙方刻正進行中、衆信最短期內、可有解決之望、苟港越航運恢復、則上海與海防間航運、自可暢通、</p>
<p>越督調任航業界探悉、頃間所獲電報、海防安謐如恒、法屢印度支那亦然、一般人對於越南前途表示樂觀、僉認不至如外間對越南命運所料之甚、法日交涉、必有順利進展蓋德義兩國、頗預聞其事、至於甫於七月新任越督德古中將、對於解決越南事件、向主强硬、惟刻已奉命調任黎優聯島總督、但德古之他調、並不影響越南地位、蓋法日交涉重心、早已移往維希折衝也、</p>
<p>郵件照發滬防航運暫告中斷後、其寄往經由海防轉遞至西南各地郵件、據確悉除重件暫行停頓、郵局視情勢許可發往前途外、所有掛號快遞平快普通郵件、上海郵政管理局業已暫發廈門轉往、故海防航運雖斷、但郵件並不受其影饗、</p>
<p>西江抵防法郵船西江號、已於三十日安抵海防、並已決定於週內駛往西貢、公司當局稱、倘越南局勢發生問題、該公司當必接得越南方面之電告、但迄昨未接得任何緊急電吿、故越南時局、諒一時不致有何變化云、</p>

<h3>國醫小兒科　沈仲芳昨被綁　沈端坐治病突闖入匪徒　出槍威嚇挾登汽車而去</h3>
<p>靜安寺路六四六號、於昨日下午一時二十分許、忽發生一綁架案、被綁者係國醫沈仲芳、挾住外出、架上大門口預置之出差汽車、駛出弄口、朝西疾駛而去、茲將詳情分誌於后、</p>
<p>臨診有年頗負聲望國醫內科醫生沈仲芳、現年六十三歲、武進籍、卜居於靜安寺路六四六弄（鳴玉坊）十五號、迄今已十餘年在醫界中薄負聲譽、故每日門診約四五十號、膝下生三子二女、年均幼穉、其長子尙未成丁、方在肄業中、沈侄名小芳、平時上午在沈寓都同乃叔診治病人、本人自設診所於愛文義路大通路口晋福里四號、</p>
<p>衣冠楚楚先後蒞止</p>
<p>沈在滬行醫、約逾三十餘年、富有資產、致遭歹人覬覦、於昨晨八時許、先有一人到來掛號、自稱高姓厲五馬路某號、旋至十時許、復來兩人、一御灰色綢長衫、一衣蜜色嗶嘰長衫、其大門口置有一黑色出差汽車、租界號碼爲一二一五七號、華界照會爲二五五六號、當兩人步至客堂間、隨後繼進一人、服派立司長衫、均屬衣冠楚楚者流、徘徊於天井中、忽拔出手槍、充常把風、其餘兩人、卽闖入右廂房沈之診所內、斯時適有門診病人兩名、沈身穿白色綢衫褲、端坐椅上、正在靜心切脈、傍有門生胡思濂、方在握筆繕方、</p>
<p>突出手槍架沈登車</p>
<p>不意兩綁匪掏出手槍、並大聲呼喝、其時室內兩病人及胡思濂均默不作聲、、呆若木雞、隨將沈挾住外出、駕登大門外預置之一二二五七號汽車內、另山一服白色杉褲之匪徒駕駛、開足速率、向弄外飛馳而去、當塲有沈之傭人鄒鑰林（年二十九歲、丹陽人、）聞警、亟奔出追趕、瞥見匪車係白牌照會、其號碼爲一二一五七號、其華界照會爲二五五六號、至里口詢問該弄九〇九號司閣捕據稱、該車駛出弄時似見車中一人、其首斜倚於另一人肩上、宛如病人模樣、該車朝西直駛而去、</p>
<p>汽車號碼似係偽造</p>
<p>事後、經沈寓投報該管新閘捕房、亟飭中西幹探馳往出事地點、奈匪車已遠颺無踪、常折至沈宅調查一過、俾得跴緝匪徒、歸案究辦、據悉沈置有自備汽車一輛、號碼爲三九三五號、平時出診、因環境關係、須熟識者介紹、方可前往應診、否則概予謝絕、故該號汽車、不常乘坐、記者事後得悉匪車係公司出差汽車、惟偏詢各汽車行、日昨並無刦車案發生、該匪車之兩號碼是否僞造、刻警務當局正在偵查中、</p>

<h3>新安納駛福清　尙無音信</h3>
<p>外輪積極試航之浙閩沿海航行、鱉江已被阻未獲成功、試航福淸之新安納輪、預計行程、昨日可抵目的地、但向福生公司詢問、該公司尙未接電告、故行程僅松門一處、致停航多時之浙閩航輪、現均加入該綫航行、謀營業上之發展、惟由松門轉往內地、行旅頗不便、故客貨並不旺盛、行駛各輪、僅恃此稍减虧蝕而已、海宜輪昨晚由滬啟椗、載客貨不多云、但外傳松門有被炸消息、不知是否可靠、</p>

<h3>萬國商團美國隊　接防中區北部　昨午集中四時出發七時接防　此後與英籍團員須輪流接替</h3>
<p>公共租界英國防軍撒離之後、其所遺中區防務、僅由萬國商團之英籍隊伍接防、實力殊嫌單薄、故公共租界當局決定召集美國商團B字大隊出動協防、已誌昨報、茲據平明社記者探得確息、商團總司令部已於昨午十二時三十分、召集B字大隊所有團員、集中待命、至昨日下午四時、整備完畢、出發開赴虹口西區、從事接防手續、至昨晚七時起、正式由美國商團負責虹口西區防務、原在該區域擔任防務之英籍商團、則於昨晩七時撤防、得休息四日、</p>
<p>英美隊伍　輪流接防</p>
<p>自萬國商團暫時塡防B區之後、工部局先後召集者英籍隊伍之A字大隊及英籍鐵甲車隊與英籍輕騎隊、惟昨日起、再召集美國商團之B字大隊協防、惟B字大隊中之葡萄牙隊、則未在動員之內、奉召者有美國隊·菲律賓隊·美國機關槍隊等三個中隊、共計買額爲二百餘人、嗣後每隔四五天、由英美兩國商團之各隊伍輪流接替、共負虹口西區之防務、</p>
<p>未商妥前　繼續辦理</p>
<p>英軍撤退後所遺防區、原已由八月十五日之各國防軍會議中多數表決、B區歸由美軍接防、C區歸由日軍接防、惟日方不顧防軍會議決議、劇烈反對、別具用意、要求保留另提建議之權利、以致議決案遲未實行、迄今猶在商討之中、在此問題未獲解決前、英美商團擔任B區防務之工作、恐尙須繼續若干時期、</p>
<h3>美舉國一致　維持遠東現狀　準備以堅決政策為後盾　大選後採取更積極立場</h3>
<p>英文泰晤士報云、本埠汽車業巨子馬迪、新近在美國遊歷、方於星期二（二十七日）乘柯立芝總統號郵船返抵滬埠、昨對本報記者稱、美國現正從事於大規模之重整軍備運動、國內全部資源、均集中於此項偉大之計劃、以資製造飛機·引擎·軍艦及近代戰爭所用之一切工具、常渠於八月四日離開美國時、此項擴軍運動、正在積極進行中、但尙未達於登峯造極之點、預料數月之後、當可完成此項計劃也、</p>
<p>如受威脅　不辭一戰</p>
<p>馬氏繼稱、美國人民之一般情緒、均主張美國保持其久已確定之政府原則、及其在西半球、經濟與物質之安全、此種安全、如遭遇威脅、則美國將毫無猶預而出於一戰、美國每一公民、鑒於目下世界政治之動盪不定、深覺國內所在進行之整軍運動、對於未來之生存、至爲重要、馬氏並稱、美國目下雖無戰時暢銷之徵象、但此種情形、爲期當不在遠、飛機·鋼鐵·軍火等各工廠、正在高速度之下、加緊工作、因此失業問題、亦隨之大見進步、同時因金錢之流通過廣、故其他工業不久亦將發生類似之影響、馬氏未離去美國之前、曾聞人云、福特汽車公司已接得合同、爲政府製造飛機引擎四萬架、同時派克汽車公司則製造一萬架、六千架爲英國定製、其餘四千架則爲美國所製、大多數美國人、覺得至十一月總統選舉完畢後、政府在世界政治中、將採取更積極之立塲、而屆時美國在各部軍備中、將有更强大之勢力、</p>
<p>美極注視　遠東時局</p>
<p>關於遠東一部、馬氏宣稱、美國始終願維持遠東之現狀、並準備以堅決之政策作爲後盾、至於英德之戰事、渠稱在過去數月間、美國人民之意見、究竟如何、尙不可知、蓋歐洲軍事之局勢、屢有變化、而戰事之進行，亦缺乏確切之報告也、自法國屈服後、擁護協約國之美人、表示極度之悲觀、但最近數星期來、沮喪之狀態、已消去矣、</p>
<p>監視外僑　間諜活動</p>
<p>馬氏復稱、第五繼隊在美國之活動、雖成爲一種眞正之危險、但聯邦調查局對於此種活動、具有良好之統制、該局對於國內各外籍人民之動向、保持密切之監視、關於未來之總統選舉、馬氏稱、近數星期之現象、威爾基似有後來居上之勢，一月前羅斯福之優勢爲十對七、後又降至七對五、但當馬氏離美林來滬之時、竟已吿相等矣、馬氏末稱、此外美國報紙百分之八五、均反對羅斯福氏第二次任云、</p>

<h3>虹口發生　離奇血案　崔國銘被人擊斃</h3>

<h3>今日記者節　報人肅穆紀念　中午靜默痛悼殉難同仁　堅定信念各作本位努力</h3>
<p>今日九月一日、爲中國新聞記者節、全國各地新聞界、或皆從事熱烈慶祝、惟本埠方面、因限於環境、僅肅穆紀念、並不舉行任何儀式、各報館各通訊社亦均仍照常工作、以促進抗建期中之重大任務、全市記者除堅定信念、藉以發揚光大報人天職外、並於中午十二時、自動靜默三分鐘、爲上海三年來爲擁護抗建國策而殉難之記者誌哀、</p>
<h3>評價提高後　米價又達頂盤　限價視同具文放寬實非必要　兩租界局等擬再集會商討</h3>
<p>米行茶會市塲昨晨循例於七時半開做、市况仍陷混亂狀態之下、各檔洋米買賣均漲至新訂限價、並現貨稀尠、人心頗緊俏、投機者不但不肯將圃貨照新訂限價脫售、並猶在市塲吸收現貨、蓋一般投機者、咸認評價會旣可隨時予以放價、則此後限價將成具文、視若莫睹、第此次評價食之寬放限價、實非必要、或謂產價倍增、米商虧耗不貲、此誠投機者之故技、不足重視、蓋市塲日昨買賣各貨、皆係一月前成交運滬者况存米之充實已無可掩飾、故深望該會予以再三考慮、卽日再度集議抑低限價、嚴厲執行、此爲四百萬市民所祈望者也、</p>
<p>雜糧市場　恢復午市</p>
<p>愛多亞路十五號上海雜糧油餅交易所、曾通告於七月份起暫停午塲交易一月、茲因時屆秋凉、况爲期已滿、決於九月二日起恢復午塲買賣、並於昨日通吿云、「查公會市塲午後停市、曾定八月底截止、茲自九月二日起恢復原狀、每日（仍照新鐘點）午前九時半起至十二時止、午後二時起至四時半止、爲市塲集合時間、特此通吿、</p>
<p>租軵當局　擬召會議</p>
<p>據西人權威方面消息、英法兩租界代表、現正斯待與傅筱庵冉度召集聯合會議、以尋求解決本市米糧問題永久辦法、據工部局高級職員稱米之情形、雖尙未達到令人驚慌之程度、但渠深信此一問題、必須由英法兩租界當局與「市府」共同合作、方有解決之辦法、按英法兩租界當局與傅筱庵在若干時前、曾一度舉行會議、以謀改進由內地運米入於租界之情形、旋於初步調查完成後、該會議卽吿延會、當時查明米市塲之非法習慣、如投機牟利囤積居奇等、皆由於內地輪入缺乏而發生恐慌之故、當時雖經一致同意、待後再行召集第二次會議、但迄今尙未採取任何行動、</p>
<p>存米一項　敷用四月</p>
<p>同時據該高級職員　、工部局之米糧供給委員會、並不擬召集特別會議、蓋越南口岸之封鎖、雖使上海失去世界最大產米區之聯絡、但此間米糧存底、該委員會仍認爲相當滿意、該職員指出、根據可靠報吿、本市存米、卽使輸入全部斷絕、亦足敷今後四個月之消費、</p>

<p>證言一斑</p>

<h3>倫敦概況</h3>
<p>倫敦爲世界第一大都會，位於泰晤士河兩岸，距海口約六十哩。其地包括「倫敦郡」，面積一百十六方哩，及「大倫教」，面積六百九十三方哩。人口八百萬。十九世紀前，倫敦僅係一市區，面積僅不過，方哩，嗣將四週各村鎭聯接成一「大倫敦」，匪特爲英國首都，亦且爲世界命融商業中心。其中部分（一）市區The　City，（二）倫敦港The　East，（三）東區The　EastEnd，（四）西區The　West　End。全境共有大小敎堂一千五百所，公園及廣塲一百餘處，大小醫院約二百所，著名建築無數。全國鐵路幹綫均以倫敦爲終站，倫敦境內鐵路綫七百餘哩，其中有地下鐵路一百七十一哩，每年乘客六萬萬人；並有公共汽車五六千輛，每年乘客十九萬萬；電車綫長三百五十六哩，每年乘客九萬萬人。船塢面積六百五十公畝，碼頭長二十八哩，每年對外貿易約十萬萬鎊，佔全國貿易四分之三。克勞頓飛機塲在其西郊，係在上次世界大戰時開闢，旋於一九二八年改造成爲世界最良機塲。</p>
<h3>英德日軍費比較</h3>
<p>— 日月</p>
<p>日本對華作戰以來的第四屆預算，共達一〇，三六〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇日圓，照官定滙率計算，約合二，八三〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇美元，其數之鉅，實爲日本有史以來所未見。此項預算中陸海軍費約佔百分之六十五，共計一，五八〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇美元，其中中國事變費共計一，〇〇〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇美元。日本全部歲收共計二五，〇〇〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇日圓，約合六，〇〇〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇美元，故上項預算的佔全部歲收五分之二。預算經費取給於賦稅者僅佔百分之四十，餘數須發行公債。中日戰爭爆發以還，日本國債增加一倍，不足爲奇。抑日本近所發行的幾種公債，僅三分之二已經認購，而自一九三七年夏起，日本紙幣流通額亦已增二倍有半。故日本人民的賦稅負担雖極重，通貨膨脹的趨勢尸顯而易見。</p>
<p>日本對華作戰，所耗軍費，連同第四屆預算指定者在內，共達四，三四三，○〇〇，〇〇〇美元，平均每年耗費約一，〇〇〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇美元，大可以之與這次歐戰的耗費互相比較。</p>
<p>本年三月十六日出版的倫敦「經濟學」家雜誌，刊有英德兩國的國富與軍費比較數字如次（以每月每單位百萬英鎊計算）</p>
<p>更以上項數字與日本預算比較如下，（以每年每單位美金百萬元計算）</p>
<h3>美國電影與音樂的消長</h3>
<p>— EL</p>
<p>誰都知道美國是世界上電影的策源地，提起「好萊塢」三字，差不多家喻戶曉。電影事業之在美國，雖比不上什麼國防工業的重要，可是聲勢浩大，深入民間，在近十年來，却也睥睨一切。然而世界上的事盛極必衰，登峯造極的美國電影事業，又何能跳出這個公例？於是中等以下的戲院，為號召顧客計，就不惜以「大拍賣」，「大贈送」式的姿態，在同業間竭力競爭。於是「一塲速映兩正片，甚至三片；」和「外加贈品，甚至免費送餐」種種招攬手段，層出不窮。製片鉅商，米高梅公司巨頭高爾溫，最近對於這個問題大發牢騷，認爲照這樣下去，美國的電影業前途，十分悲觀，於是做了一篇好萊塢病了」的文章，大聲疾呼，希望注意這個嚴重問題，使這「沒落之門」已開的電影業，不要眞的一蹶不振。這是今日美國電影的現家。次論美國的音樂，其趨勢却和電影成一個反比例，倒是潛滋暗長，大見起色。紐約州羅吉士脫大學，伊斯脫曼音樂院院長亨生博士，近在國民敎育會議席上，盛稱美國已成爲「世界上音樂最發達的國家。」</p>
<p>目下美國大概有電影院一萬七千五百家，其中大約百份之六十至六十五的，每塲連映兩部正片，不過這些都是中下級的戲院。專映「頭輪」片的上等戲院却每塲只映一部正片，其數的佔總數百份之三十五至四—。以全美國看電影的顧客而言，到這種專映「頭輪」片的上等戲院去的，至少要佔到半數。這一半的電影觀衆，其所納的入塲票，佔到總數四份之三。照這樣說起來，專看「頭輪」片的上等顧客倒是製片公司的「衣食父母」。所以派拉蒙公司副經理弗里門曾說，影片公司把他們的出品交給中下等戲院去開映，眞是件失算之事。影片的剎潤大多從頭挑的戲院裏得來，一部上好的片子總要接連映上幾期；到後來把片子送　到「二輪」或「三輪」戲院中去，於是每塲要連映兩部正片，放映了一天就要換片。他眞有些慨乎言之了。</p>
<p>近年來影片的賣座收入，拿統計數字來看，未免有些日趨「下流」。一九三〇年，美國各家電影院每星期所售出的戲票，平均爲八千萬張。一九四〇年，不問電影的攝製技術上如何的更有進步，每屎期的售票額，大約還不足六千五百萬張之數　從這上面看來，豈不是電影事業已經「患了重病」。</p>
<p>據格洛浦博士，以投票方法測騐大衆對於一塲映一片，一塲連映兩片的意嚮，雖然最後的結果尙未能揭曉，但他以可靠的預測來推算，不贊成每塲連映兩正片的，大約每四個人中有三人，與贊成者之比較，爲三與一之比。其中尤以中上人士階級，每星期收人在二十五元左右者，尤反對兩片制。這班人都是票價八角，五角和四角戲院的主顧。四角頭的顧客最不贊成一塲連映兩片，他們所報效於電影業的金錢却最爲可觀。以票子的數量而論，當然中級以下戲院所售出的，比較上級戲院爲鉅，但是售出「張四角票子電影業方面所得的利益，實較兩張一角五分者爲鉅大，所以四角顧客的意旨倒是不容忽視的呢。</p>
<p>在兩片制盛行的情况之下，好萊塢的各製片商，爲供給各方需求起見，自不得不出於粗製濫造的一途。目下每年正片的生產量的六百部，卽使把全世界的第一流劇作家都請到好萊塢去，恐怕也創造不出六百種上好劇本哩。而卽就這六百之數的影片而論，能够稱到上選的敢說不致超過五十部，其他的一百五十部就祗不過看得過去罷了。這種悲觀的現象，一部份富然由於缺乏良好劇作家所造成；但是製片商的只求出貨迅速，對於劇本的生吞活剝，粗製濫造，實亦不能辭其一部份的責任。</p>
<p>從前攝製片，處處地方都很精細周詳。一律攝製完竣，先要經過預映，看看觀衆的反應如何。如果劇情嚴盡的地方，觀衆反而失笑，或者有趣的地方，反而聽不到笑聲，那末就要把片子拿回製片廠去，查究原因，所在，加以補救。米高梅曾於一片攝竣，經過四個月的修改重攝，方纔發行。這便是普通片子與優良片子的區別所在，但是現在一般製片商，只求產量增進，那裏還有這種精細呢。</p>
<p>其次，爲充份發展劇情起見，平均一部正片需要一點鐘及二十分鐘的放映時間，甚至要兩小時。但是放映的電影院，往往公開的向製片商要求，把片子弄得愈短愈好，如果放映時時間過長，那末就沒有法子接續連映另一正片，和其他的零碎短片。觀衆們勢必要求之於第二塲了。在這種要求之下，一張片子往往削之又削，縮之又縮，試問成績還會好麼？其實只要片子好，觀衆決不會嫌時間太長的，只要看「亂世佳人」不是叫觀衆實足坐上四小時麼！</p>
<p>電影明星不患其少，但是以六百部片子來分，出類拔萃的就不過五十餘人而己。有時很好的脚色，他與劇中人個性不合，反而弄得很糟。從前，第一流明星的演戲生命，平均爲十年至上五年。我祗舉出范朋克和曼麗辟克馥已足够了。現在的明星生存期祇不過五年光景；往往星光乍現，倏又隕滅。</p>
<p>任何一家大影片製造公司，都把全國劃分爲若干發行區域。每一區域中又指定幾個城市爲「主要城市」，在這城市裏就有一家或幾家首輪戲院，凡是該公司所出的新片，都交由這些首輪戲院開映。我們現在且把專映「首輪」片者稱之爲甲種戲院，其票價則假定爲五角。新片在甲種戲院放映旣畢，中間經過兩星期的歇息，就送到乙種戲院去放映，其票價爲三角半或四角。同樣的，乙種戲院放映完畢後，隔了一星期的歇息，再送到丙種戲院去映演，票價則爲二角五分。這歇息時期稱之爲「淸掃期」，乃特爲保護放映商的利益而設。因爲片子愈新鮮，票價也愈高了</p>
<p>然而影戲院的等級決不止甲·乙·丙三種，每况愈下，接着還有丁種戊種甚至已種。道些小影戲院，在一部片子出世後，非得要隔上一年半載，纔輪到他們去放映。這時候票價和淸掃期已經低减至無可再低的程度。試問在戊種戲院票價已經减低限度的情形下，已種戲院的老闆有什麼吸引的法子可以去號召觀客呢？而戊種戲院今夜所開映的片子，一到明天在已種戲院映演時，票價就要低减一角：那末戊種戲院的售貴一角，他豈不要　人家說「師出無名」麼？於是一塲開映兩正片，便成爲這兩家戲院同一的出路了。　（未完）</p>

<h3>舞　（二）</h3>
<p>漢通匈奴，胡樂行於中國，箏笳琵琶之屬，以繁急哀濫之音，變中正和平之聽，漸而金鼓絲竹，演出雜劇，而舞竟一變而爲科介，再變而爲觔斗矣。惟歷代相傳，郊天宗廟臨雍諸典禮，猶用古樂器歌詞舞節，然隨時所尙，器數聲容，不盡同也；而自此數事以外，則民間莫得而見之。各省文廟，除近日修明禮樂之數府縣外，餘皆樂懸空設，舞節不齊。前數年有脩演典禮者，見者譁然，似將失笑，此可見習俗之甚，而古道之難復也。舞；有文德之舞以羽籥，有武功之舞以干戚，今文舞變爲戲劇中之科介矣，武舞則變爲觔斗及戰門翻跳諸技，而民顧樂而觀之，事之遷流，一至於此，殊可慨也！西國之樂，間嘗聽之，歌一字則應樂器一聲，其隨歌隨舞，亦各應聲而爲節，有似於文德之舞，至其樂器之不同於中國，則器隨所尙，不必與中國同製也。大抵西樂器絲竹之音少，而搏拊之音多，雖不同於中國，而其意則與古樂舞相似也。</p>

<h3>耶穌基督的勇敢（一）</h3>
<p>從前耶穌被釘在十字架上的時候，有許多旁觀者冷嘲熱諷的說：『他救了別人，不能救自己』，其實耶穌並非不能救自己，只因要救別人，纔不救自己，甘心忍受十字架的痛苦，這是耶穌愛世人到了極點的表現，但從另一方面看來，也足見得耶穌的勇敢。怕與愛，都是人類社會中推進一切文化的原動力，人因爲怕冷，纔縫製衣服；因爲怕風雨，纔建築房屋。因爲怕沉溺，纔造船隻；因爲怕刑罰，纔不爲非作歹。怕雖與人類文化的進步有不少的助力，然而也有它的害處，就是容易產生許多阻凝文化的迷信。耶穌不祇有捨身十架，從容就義的勇敢，他一生爲人，也是處處勇敢。不要怕三字，是他鼓勵人的口號。現在我們根據耶穌言行錄，提出幾點關於耶穌在各方面的勇敢：</p>
<p>（一）忠實於上帝和眞理：『耶路撤冷人中有的說，這不是他們想要殺的人嗎？你看他還明明的講道：」（的翰七26）有人想要殺他，危機四伏的時候，仍是不顧一切，爲上帝和眞理作見證，勸人應當順從眞理，當有歸向上帝的眞精神，崇尙實際，不重虛文。就是他的仇敵也說他是『誠誠實實傳上帝的道，甚麼人都不徇情面」。（馬太廿二16）</p>
<p>（二）不怕暴露當時人的偽善：平常人總喜歡在背後議論人的長短，某也賢，某也不肖。及至見了面，却又極力恭維，百般趨奉。耶穌則不如此，他對於人的態度，乃是表裏如一，心口相符，他對於當時在政治和宗敎方面的權威者，毫不客氣，指斥他們的不是，說他們是粉飾的墳墓，外面雖然好看，裏面却裝滿了死人的骨頭。（四日續登）讀者欲知群細，請函詢上海愛文義路三五一號文字布道社，當有詳細答覆。</p>
<h3>觀察事物</h3>
<p>— 木聖</p>
<p>小朋友你們在學校裏上課讀書，目的不是爲了要求知識嗎？但是在學校裏求得的知識，是有限的，主要的，還是要靠自己在課外去找尋。</p>
<p>有許多事物，雖是天天看見，但是你能明白它的構造，組織，來歷，成因，所以如此的道理嗎？舉個例來說：汽車是我們天天看見的，可是你能明白它的構造怎樣？是誰發明的？爲什麼能行走？在夏天每個人都要打防疫針，可是你能明白什麼叫防疫？防疫有幾種？爲什麼要打防疫針？假使你對於這問題不能回答，就該詳細地觀察一下，然後再精密地硏究一下，必定要求出正確的答案。我們要把四週所見的事物，無論是像狗爲什麼在夏天要將舌子伸出口外等的小問題，都要加以觀察」一定要求出「爲什麼」的道理。要是觀察，硏究以後，還是不知，你可以去請敎別人，直到明白爲止。</p>
<p>小朋友！要是你能够照着我的話去做，那麼我可保險，你所得到的知識，定要比一學期中，從書本上得到的知識來得多。</p>
<h3>就業卽是求知</h3>
<p>— 楊春綠</p>
<p>榕廣！最可愛的小朋友！今天你的爸爸來校，談起你一天到晚的鬱鬱不樂，因爲你的爸無力給你升學，打算送你去做學徒。呀！我該用什麼話來安慰你呢！</p>
<p>榕廣！能得　學，的確是幸運的；但是就業的，也並沒有截斷求知的緣分，『就業卽是求知」呀！你要知道，一切的學問，是產生在社會裏的，決不是那學校裏狹小的敎室所能包括得盡的。整個的社會，就是一所大的學校，各種生活，都是活的學科，可供你儘量探討，盡情體騐。</p>
<p>古今中外的偉人，有許多都是從學徒中奮鬬出來的呢！你聽說過的罷：英國創造鐵路的斯梯芬生，美國發明電燈的愛迪生，吾國發明四角號碼檢字法的王雲五，創造華生電風扇的楊濟川……他們小時候，都是做學徒的。學徒決不會限制人的發展的，只要你能刻苦上進，成功自會向你招手。</p>
<p>榕廣！你也不必那樣的鬱鬱不樂，從今天起，就該打起精神來，計劃着如何到無限大的社會中去努力！我也同樣地希望每個輟學就業的小朋友，都這樣地踏上成功之途！</p>
<h3>傘兵</h3>
<p>— 金箴</p>
<p>歐洲的戰爭差不多已爆發了將近一年，而近幾個星期來，英德空戰非常劇烈，各式各樣新奇的戰具，都在試騐它們的威力，到底達到了怎樣的程度？什麼噴火飛機，無聲炸彈……都是科學家心血的結晶品，不過却被戰神去利用來屠殺人們，這一慕人殺人的慘劇，在整個的地球上串演着。</p>
<p>一天，那恐怕是在上一個月中旬的那一天，阿慧無意中在報紙上看見了這一段消息：「英國中部某鎮警衛隊發見空中灰色之物，卽向人警吿德國降落傘兵已在英國中部降落，乃大肆搜緝，但並未發見降落傘兵之蹤跡……傘」。傘兵又是一種新鮮的名字，在阿慧簡單的腦海中，當然是莫明其妙的了。於是便引起了他和阿明一番談話的動機。</p>
<p>「哥哥，傘兵倒底是什麼一回事」？</p>
<p>「傘兵的確是個很新鮮的名字，在歐洲第一次大戰時，還沒有採用這種戰略。最先發明這種新奇戰術的，確是蘇俄，每在舉行紅軍大操演或航空節的當兒，常有傘兵降落的表演節目。在一架大型的飛機上，滿載了全副武裝的兵士，從高空中飛下來，一頂頂傘在空中飛蕩着，你試想，這一幅畫面是多麼的精彩，不過這是在表演吧了。這次德國也要利用了這戰術，希圖在英國降落，據報載英境發現德降落傘，但未獲傘兵，但是德國確有採用傘兵的可能，如果交戰國一旦利用傘兵攻擊，那戰塲是擴大了不知多少倍更沒有前後方之區別，而在守的一方面更感困難了。譬如像法國馬寄諾防綫，設備是何等的完善，建築是何等的鞏固，眞所謂銅牆鐵壁，敵人不能越雷池一步，要是對方利用傘兵攻擊防綫的後方，那無論怎樣堅固的防綫，也失了它的效用。據說傘兵的訓練比了普通士兵來得困難得多，因爲傘兵必需具有陸空二軍的智識，而更需有冒險不怕死的信心。你想，一國的士兵帶了武器，深入敵國的內地，更要把敵國的一切地形都要熟悉，這是件很困難的事情，所以傘兵不過是間諜的一種而已，要是眞的攻擊後方，那是不可能的。然而傘兵究竟是歐洲第二次戰爭中的特產品，我國有一句「飛將軍從天而降」老話，到了現代，才證明了它的確實性。</p>
<h3>只有小孩聽了笑的</h3>
<p>— 賢方</p>
<p>不知在多少年以前不知在那一座山裏，一隻獅睡熟了。一隻狼悄悄地走來，輕輕地用繩子把它綑縛。它正睡得酣，一點不知覺。後來因爲被縛得緊了，它醒了，它抵抗。雖然因爲被縛住，吃了不少虧，可是那也弄得那筋疲力竭，氣息奄奄。</p>
<p>那時候，在不遠處的地方，一隻虎與一隻豹突然的狠鬥起來。豹向狼招手，要它幫同殺虎。狼捨不得虎的肥肉，但又離不關獅的困鬥；於是它對虎說：『你要我不幫豹，你幫我把獅縛住。」虎點點頭，就把獅緊緊的綑縛了。</p>
<p>狼志滿意得，不怕獅來報復，欣然地和豹一同攻虎，希望把虎打死，分得一塊肥肉。</p>
<p>那獅子，被縛得緊緊的，怒了。它使盡全身的氣力，發動每一條脈絡，每一個細胞，掙扎，努力的掙扎，掙斷了束縛，恢復了自由，就在吼一聲，把狼呑了，把虎殺了……小孩子聽到這裏，拍手大笑。</p>
<h3>一封討論寫字的信（下）</h3>
<p>— 何仁</p>
<p>三不要放過練習的機會。你們的日常生活中，有不少寫字的機會，不要輕易放過。譬如每天晚上，媽媽要上零用帳，你們應該搶來寫。家裏有空屋出租，召租條子別讓爸爸寫去。至於在學校裏，寫字的機會更多了。謄作文哪，抄筆記哪，演習算題哪，在在都是練習的好機會，千萬別草草率率的亂塗下。</p>
<p>（四）多練習寫錯的字，寫不好的字。自己常常寫錯的字寫得不好看的字，隨時注意，摘出來，記錄在一本小簿子上。然後再利用廢物，如舊敎科書，舊報紙等等，去找尋你們記錄下來的字，把寫得好的，剪下來，貼在另外一本簿子上，時常照著寫。</p>
<p>（五）多練習小字，中字。寫字在社會上最普遍的應用，是記帳和寫信。記帳用的帳簿寫信用的信箋，各有直行格子。格子的寬度雖不一律，但是總在三四分左右，這可以作爲小字的標準。同樣中字可以用普通信封上及帳簿封面上的字作爲標準，的七八分到一寸見方。我們初步畢寫字，旣應注重實用，自然要多練習小字，中字。</p>
<p>（六）鉛筆字，鋼筆字也要練習。現在社會上，鉛筆字，鋼筆字的應用，一天普遍一天。譬如商店裏開的發票，大都用鉛筆，記新式帳大都用鋼筆。你們一升入中學，作讀書筆記，作功課上的練習，大都用鉛筆鋼筆。鉛筆，鋼筆的應用既這樣廣，自應描出一部份時間來練習鉛筆字鋼筆字。</p>
<p>（七）最好和朋友共同練習，時常作寫字比賽。你們可以邀集鄰近的小朋友，組織一個寫字比賽會。的定每天寫字一張，每星期比賽一次，看誰的字寫得好，進步得快。這樣可以引起競爭心，提高興緻進步自然快了。　「字無百日功」，這不是說，寫字只要練習一百天，便一定寫得好了，不過是說，只要有恒心，天天繼續不斷的練習，字決不會寫不好的。努力罷！親愛的弟妹。志哥。二九，八，廿三，</p>

<h3>羅斯福夫人演慈善片</h3>
<p>— 華志</p>
<p>有「觀世音」的風水</p>
<p>美國總統羅斯福的家庭，充滿了藝術的氣息，子女們個個多才多藝。自從羅氏的長子詹姆士，年前放棄保險事業，而從事電影事業之後，全家對於銀色藝術的興趣，也大見增加。</p>
<p>總統的夫人愛倫諾女士，平日本是女界的模範，長於著作演說，慷慨尙義，聲望隆重極了。她對於電影事業，視爲良好的敎育工具，積極提倡，歷來雖然在一些新聞短片裏現身銀幕，却並沒有正式主演影片的機會。</p>
<p>直到最近，羅夫人爲提倡慈善事業，在長子的懇求之下，竟允許替福斯公司主演了一部慈善片，這無疑是一個驚人的消息。以一國元首夫人之尊，而親自獻身於銀慕，前者阿爾巴尼亞國皇后出亡美國後，卽有此議，但以條件不合未實現，終讓羅夫人佔其先着了。</p>
<p>羅夫人主演的片子，名曰「行善之樂」，取材方面以美國上流婦女的社交生活爲經以樂善好施爲緯，頗有中國國片「觀世音」的作風，這部片子預備在籌募慈善，捐款的場所，公開演出，增加募捐的效率。</p>
<p>當然，羅夫人的主演影片，完全是義務性質，決不受什麼報酬，並且她平時各種著作和播音的收入，已經很多，又當二年前，童星秀蘭鄧波兒游歷華盛頓時，曾往白宮晋謁總統夫婦，羅夫人很歡喜她，希望她將來能多演幾部感化人性的片子，最近秀蘭有退休之說，一部人因此盛傳她要拍一部慈善片，作爲臨去秋波了。</p>
<h3>卡爾登展期開幕</h3>
<p>— 稜白</p>
<p>王熙春周信芳先後病倒</p>
<p>卡爾登在一個半月前，爲了冷氣開放不合算的關係，宜吿歇夏，但是移風社的陣容，却是無形中間調動了。譬如金素雯于宗瑛劉文魁張慧聰等等，都已分別加入共舞台與天蟾舞台，同時周信芳亦以冷靜的頭腦，邀妥姜雲霞王競硏蓋鶴崑王英武等等，其中，王熙春的重新加入合作，該是最爲觀衆所欣喜的。</p>
<p>本來，卡爾登預定上月二十七日開幕的。但因王熙春忙於電影工作，以致病倒，不得不讓她休息數天，所以展期到本月二日開幕，並且已經擬定先演舊劇一月，然後冉排「六本文素臣」。不料正在積極籌劃一切方針的時候，周信芳却也病倒了，檢討他這次病倒的原因，原來上次伶界聯合會保產會演唱三天義務戲時，都有他的戲份，開塲二天，在他尙不覺得辛累，到了第三天，日塲演唱全部一盧俊義與史文恭」，足足演了六個鐘頭，到了晚間，又演唱做繁重的靠把戲「戰長沙」，當時在台上，已經力不勝任，不過他的好勝心重，始終冒上，致辛勞過度，就此病倒了。</p>
<p>現在，他的病勢並不减輕，每天熱度總在一百〇一與一百〇二度間，所以短時期內，或許不能完全痊愈。當然，卡爾登的開幕日期，也就祗得展緩了。</p>

<h3>陳薇漣小姐</h3>
<p>— 陶</p>
<p>過去，業餘劇社的產生亦曾風湧過一時的，雖然有的是不聲不響地過去了，可是也有的是在不斷地埋頭苦幹着；菁莪劇社就是這中間的一個。</p>
<p>菁莪劇社不但擁有念幾位對劇界肯負責任的社員永遠團結着，而且社員非常優秀整齊這裏介紹的陳薇漣小姐就是該社中的一位最前進的演員，這學期她剛在錫師畢業，一口伶俐動聽的國語和淸脆的喉嚨早已使她成爲一位多才多藝者，除了具有那適合舞台條件的身段，和豐富的舞台經騐外，還具有剛毅靈活的手段，與和靄可親的交際，幫着團體的前進，當然，凡是接近過她的都曾留着一個美滿的回憶！</p>

<p>那少年的頭雖又低沉下去，仍不答話，但我還瞧得見他的慘白的臉上泛上了一陣紅暈，他在咬自己的嘴脣。</p>
<p>倪金壽忽代替着回答。「我相信他的讀書，也許祇是掛一個幌子，祇是忙玩舞女，爭風吃醋，甚至幹出殺人勾當，功課也許壓根兒不在他心上。」</p>
<p>霍桑不答，但冷笑了一聲，把經視的眼光向那少年瞥了一瞥，又低頭瞧瞧他的皮鞋，便在一張沙發上坐下來，隨手將呢帽擱在旁邊的茶几上。</p>

<p>霍桑把他的眼鏡和假鬚都放進衣袋裏去。他忽瞧見了書桌面上的那支鍍鎳手槍，便站起來拿槍瞧了一瞧，重新放下，回到他的原座。他緩緩地答道：「不肯說話？那你也用不着性急。他終有肯說話的時候。」</p>
<p>倪金壽似乎有些兒失望。他好像自己問不出供，希望霍桑來代勞，却不料霍桑竟這樣輕描淡寫。霍桑從衣袋中摸出一隻烟盒來。</p>

<h3>Pan Wenhua Arrives in Chongqing to Report on His Duties</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Pan Wenhua, the Pacification Commissioner of the Sichuan-Shaanxi-Hubei Border Region, arrived in Chongqing yesterday and stayed at his private residence in Zengjiayan. He told visitors that his current trip to Chongqing to report on his duties coincided with the major Japanese bombing of Chongqing. The former prosperity has mostly turned to ruins, which is heartbreaking to see. However, although material things can be destroyed, the spirit should become stronger with bombing. Especially after this major destruction, Chongqing's future construction will definitely be more advanced than before, and the major Chongqing construction plan, which has been completed in the past and future, will be completed in the most scientific way. (Telegram dated August 31st)</p>
<h3>Tan Kah Kee and Others Arrive in Changsha</h3>
<p>Changsha: Tan Kah Kee, along with Li Tiemin and a party of four, arrived here by boat this afternoon. More than a hundred representatives from all walks of life in Changsha welcomed them at the dock. According to Tan's interview with reporters, Hunan is the cornerstone of the war of resistance and national reconstruction. He had excellent impressions of this trip. He inspected the bombed disaster areas along the way and saw refugees burying themselves in the rubble and starting their businesses again, still full of vitality. Moreover, now is the autumn harvest season, and troops stationed in various places are helping farmers with the harvest. All these spirits of hard work and cooperation between the military and the people are sufficient guarantees for the final victory. (Telegram dated August 31st)</p>

<h3>Chongqing's Water Supply Can Be Guaranteed</h3>
<p>Chongqing: According to those in charge of the water supply project here, Chongqing currently has an adequate water source supply. Even if the buildings of the Second Water Plant are completely destroyed in the next air raid, it will not matter. (United Press telegram dated August 31st)</p>
<h3>Value of Controlled Exports Approximately 600 Million Yuan Annually; Half of the National Cotton-Producing Areas Have Fallen; The Government is Improving Cotton Seeds in the Southwest</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Economic Minister Weng Wenhao stated that the government's sales of controlled goods overseas, such as silk, tea, cotton, tung oil, hog bristles, tungsten, antimony, and tin, are estimated to be worth approximately 600 million yuan annually. Before the war, China's imports of rice accounted for 3% of the national average annual production of 700 million dan. However, at present, Free China is not worried about rice shortages due to the good harvests of the previous three years. China still needs to do its best to produce sufficient raw materials to supply its hundreds of millions of people with clothing. Before the war, China's annual cotton production was 12 million dan, but half of the cotton-producing areas have fallen. Therefore, the Chinese government is currently improving cotton seeds in the southwestern provinces and opening 92 yarn mills in the interior to meet the needs.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Germany in the European War and the Far East</h3>
<p>Inherited historical traditions, emotions ignited by grievances, further guided by different beliefs, and weighed against different interests, prevent people from reaching a consensus. This lack of uniformity is almost innate, even permanent. Germany has its own firmly held views, and Britain has its own firmly held views; it is their adherence to these views that leads to war. China, also at war, insists that national independence and freedom are essential; and that resistance is necessary when independence and freedom are threatened. However, beyond the limits of national independence and freedom, China believes that even if countries like Britain and Germany have different views, there is no need to insist on them; this is China's view. Under this view, China naturally hopes for an early end to the war between Britain and Germany; knowing that this hope is futile, yet still earnestly cherishing it!</p>
<p>Based on the views held by Britain, and applying them to Britain's attitude towards the Far East, we can easily list various events before today to illustrate its contradictions. Britain has its own reasons for excusing each contradiction; indeed, some of them should be excused.</p>
<p>Based on the views held by Germany, and applying them to the Far East, the situation is very subtle. Not only does each issue have more than one perspective, but even the same issue should be viewed differently at different times. As time progresses and opportunities shift, we firmly believe that Germany's views on everything in the Far East must also be evolving accordingly with time and opportunity. What we currently expect from this evolution is certainly not to expect action, as circumstances and constraints prevent this, at least for now; but rather how to express honest and clear indications from everything at present. Past events need not be discussed. The current situation is vastly different from the past: in the past, there was a need to wave flags and shout slogans, to promote momentum, hoping for victory without fighting, and also hoping to assist in wartime; currently, it is a real battle, facing life and death, rejecting anything that is not beneficial to combat, and certainly preventing anything that is harmful after the war. In the past, any aspect that weakened Britain slightly, or constrained its activities slightly, or shook its prestige slightly, was considered beneficial to Germany; currently, in the Far East, there is practically no nation or force that helps Britain because Germany does not compromise, thus effectively striking Germany, or helps Germany because of its sweet words and generous gifts, thus effectively striking Britain. Furthermore, even if Britain is struck in the Far East, it will not affect Britain's fighting power in the North Sea, the Mediterranean, or the Near East; that is, it will not help Germany's war against Britain in the slightest. What can effectively strike Britain, if anything, is not in the Far East. In the past, Germany had industrial and commercial interests in the Far East, which was part of the financial resources for Germany's manufacturing of airplanes and tanks, but it certainly did not rely on airplanes and tanks to enjoy these interests. Currently, these interests have been suspended due to the European war. As for the future, no matter the outcome of the European war, the Far East industrial and commercial interests, which do not need the protection of airplanes and tanks, are what Germany should strive to manage in any situation! What Germany should manage and can supply in large quantities, undoubtedly, is the independent, free, and recovering China, which is most suitable for both sides! In the past, Germany and France were opposed, and Germany certainly had conflicting interests with France, so there was no way to strategize against France. Currently, the situation is different. We do not believe that the Far East policy of France's Petain government is solely dictated by Germany. We sympathize with the Petain government and have high hopes for it, so we do not think that way. However, we always believe that whenever we hear news of the Petain government gradually making concessions in the Far East, the encouragement it receives is not enough to maintain its courage, and what can best encourage its courage is undeniably Germany. In the Far East issue, Germany creates opportunities for others without making honest and clear indications, and is also taken as an international tool by others. Why does Germany still not think that it is not entirely generous in giving others benefits!</p>
<p>We firmly believe that Germany's views on the Far East are evolving. As German journalists have repeatedly discussed in Shanghai and Chongqing, as Mr. Kordt of the Embassy discussed in Shanghai the day before yesterday, and as the articles in the recent Berlin "German People's Economic Journal" are based on, all give us good impressions and strengthen what we firmly believe. At the same time, we are still afraid that German personnel may make a misjudgment: during the war against Britain, it is easy to be misled by emotions and believe that everything that is unfavorable to Britain is beneficial to Germany, is what Germany is pleased with, and is what Germany is happy to approve. Examine the previous argument, and you will surely know that it is not so in the Far East issue!</p>
<h3>America to Send Naval, Land, and Air Forces to Strengthen the Defense of the Philippines; British-American Negotiations Achieve Satisfactory Results; Singapore Completes Defense Measures</h3>
<p>Washington: Well-informed sources in military circles here reported last night that the U.S. Navy may soon dispatch more military aircraft, submarines, and even large units of naval and land forces to the Philippines as part of America's great national defense program. It is widely believed that President Roosevelt, after mobilizing half of the U.S. national defense forces, will order several small teams of the army to report to the islands for training there. The news that the United States is about to reinforce its land and air forces on the Philippine Islands coincides with Philippine President Quezon's recent call for enhanced defense of the islands. Some people here object to further fortification of the Philippine Islands, believing that the Philippine Islands are indefensible. However, observers have recently noticed a significant change, namely that the U.S. Navy circles in Washington believe that if the United States can actively increase the strength of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, the Philippine Islands are not indefensible. Interior officials stated last night that a decision on Philippine President Quezon's request that the Philippine Islands be allowed to participate in the U.S. military expansion program will be made within days. Military officials were unable to learn last night how many troops President Roosevelt will dispatch to the Philippine Islands, but said that naval and national defense forces will be sent there for training. The U.S. Navy is currently expanding its strength, increasing by 1,000 men per month since the middle of last year. It is widely believed that another 16,000 men are needed to reach a total of 50,000 men. Under the National Defense Force Mobilization Act, approximately one million men will be ordered to mobilize this week. (United Press telegram dated August 31st)</p>
<p>Singapore: Authorities here "to cope with the situation in the Far East" have rapidly completed the final defense steps, and this British imperial outpost may soon become an important U.S. naval base. Today, it has become a strong fortress. Coastal obstacles, such as private docks, pavilions, and swimming fences, which were originally intended to prevent sharks, have now been removed. The coastline has been covered with barbed wire, including the commercial district of Collyer Quay. Recent legislation stipulates that British expatriates must serve in the military, and many Britons have been drafted for military training, training five times a week, including Saturday afternoons and Sunday mornings. The government has also implemented food controls, establishing a rice warehouse. All rice imported into Singapore from other ports must pass through this warehouse, allowing the authorities to maintain the purchase and storage of new rice. The government has also adopted allocation measures for the heavy transport of food exports, but strives to avoid hindering export trade. (United Press telegram dated August 31st)</p>
<p>Hyde Park: President Roosevelt declared yesterday that negotiations between the United States and Britain on obtaining British territories in the Western Hemisphere as U.S. naval and air bases are progressing smoothly. President Roosevelt said that he could not announce the content of the negotiations because of their complex nature. President Roosevelt said that there was no other fresh news other than the proposal to sell 50 old U.S. destroyers to Britain. As a result of British-American negotiations, the United States has obtained the right to establish a naval base in the Bermuda Islands. The establishment of the U.S.-Canada Joint Defense Committee will accelerate the U.S.'s efforts to obtain naval and air bases on the eastern coast of Canada. President Roosevelt and his spokesmen currently refuse to comment on reports that the United States is seeking to borrow the Singapore naval port as an outpost for the U.S. Far East Fleet. (United Press telegram dated August 31st)</p>
<p>Washington: U.S. Secretary of State Hull declared at an intelligence conference yesterday that there was no new news to report regarding the British-American negotiations on the lease of British bases. According to well-informed sources, the negotiations are nearing completion. (Haitong telegram dated August 31st)</p>
<h3>U.S. President to Immediately Order National Defense Forces to Undergo Training; Conscription Likely to Be Passed Finally; Army Department Personnel Discuss Tactics</h3>
<p>Hyde Park: Roosevelt indicated yesterday that he will immediately issue an order to mobilize the National Guard to undergo one year of intensive military training. (United Press telegram dated August 31st)</p>
<p>Washington: The U.S. House Rules Committee yesterday voted to limit the debate on the conscription bill to two days, starting next Tuesday. According to the original bill, it has already been passed by the House. What is being discussed now is the part amended by the Senate. The House Rules Committee also decided yesterday to allow the House Army Committee to maintain the "industrial conscription" amendment, so that industry can be operated by the state in the event of a national emergency. The final passage of this bill, as well as President Roosevelt's signature, are expected to be completed by the end of next week. Twelve million Americans, aged 20 to 45, are likely to register for enlistment, of which 4.5 million are suitable for military service. Conscription may begin in mid-September and will proceed as quickly as possible. The Army Department currently plans to train more than one million people within a year. Army Department personnel, when referring to the training of soldiers, said that the U.S. military plan will continue to be based on "experimental" warfare and will not change, because Germany's victory in Europe is attributed to this tactic. Military scholars have made a detailed analysis of the French war report, and the conclusion is that the Germans have new technologies in modern warfare, but there is no surprising evolution in strategy. It is heard that Army Department officials are studying how to answer the general public and military personnel who advocate that the U.S. Army abandon its existing organization and adopt German methods. Army Department personnel believe that Germany's massive tank attacks and the use of fierce air bombing are not military innovations, and feel that the Germans' tactics do not have any new developments that are sufficient to defeat a well-equipped and powerful U.S. military. The U.S. defense plan, in light of the Battle of Argonne-Meuse in 1918, is based on an offensive approach. The U.S. Air Force has been training in concentrated attack techniques for several years. What the Air Force currently lacks is a sufficient amount of aircraft to engage in a large-scale aerial battle with German aircraft fleets. The situation with tanks, according to military experts and observers, is the same as with aircraft. The German attack merely advances with a massive amount of various types of tanks, but its strategy is still the old "charge" tactic, assisted by infantry and closely connected supply lines. This is the tactic that Germany used to defeat France. Each German attack unit is complete and self-sufficient, which is the same as the U.S. Army. These units were able to break through the Allied forces' attempt to cut off their quick connection with the main German forces on the northern border of France. The legendary attack tactics, improved by Napoleon, are of two types: one is "flanking" and the other is "breakthrough." Because the Allied forces' flanks are protected by various geographical factors, the ocean, and the Maginot Line, Germany adopted the ordinary breakthrough method. The demarcation lines of the French defense forces were too clear and lacked sufficient flexibility. As a result, they could not quickly deploy units to attack tanks to the front lines to resist the tank attacks, resulting in the collapse of the entire army. German infantry closely followed the tanks everywhere and occupied strategic areas. Once the famous Belgian Fort Eben-Emael was captured, it was possible to reach Belgian territory directly, and the Allied forces' route was also occupied by German infantry. The German army's capture of this fortress also employed old-fashioned tactics. (United Press telegram dated August 31st)</p>

<h3>Soviet Union Striving to Reorganize Red Army to Resist Any Attack</h3>
<p>London – According to dispatches from Moscow, the most surprising development in Moscow recently has been the movement to improve the efficiency of the army, which has made excellent progress and produced remarkable results. Soldiers appear clean and alert, and salute officers immediately, a stark contrast to what was seen several months ago. The Red Army's "think tank," consisting of Kolik, Meleskov, and Shabesnikov, is working hard to quickly build an army capable of resisting any form of attack. The Americans were shocked by the sudden collapse of France, which is why the Red Army is rapidly reorganizing. (Reuters, 31st)</p>

After heavily bombing Berlin, it also defeated the elite pilots of the German "Yellow Nose" Messerschmitt fighter squadrons in a large-scale air battle over Britain today. The air battle took place over a city on the southeast coast of England. German planes began a savage attack at dawn. Twelve planes of its "Yellow Nose" squadron dived from all directions to attack barrage balloons, opening fire with incendiary bullets, causing several balloons to catch fire and fall. Anti-aircraft guns of all calibers opened fire. At least four Messerschmitts were shot down, and the German planes began to retreat towards the French coast. Not many hours after the British planes returned from bombing Berlin, German planes flew over various regions of Britain to continue their intense attacks. By noon, London had issued three alerts in a row. (Reuters, 31st)</p>
<p>London – Yesterday, hundreds of German planes (some say over seven hundred), in retaliation for the British Air Force's attack on Berlin, attempted to break into the center of London three times without success. British fighter planes also densely covered the sky, scattering the German squadrons. Aided by anti-aircraft guns, they shot down a total of fifty-three German planes. Fifteen British planes were lost. After the air battle, it was clear that the German effort to break through London's defenses had been crushed by London's anti-aircraft guns and fighter defenses. German bombers attacked London in batches from all directions, but only managed to approach the suburbs. When London issued the third alert yesterday, ten German planes were shot down in the London area. In the afternoon, a large squadron of German planes, estimated at over two hundred, flew over the southeast coast of England. Last night, incendiary bombs were dropped on the outskirts of London. It was reported that incendiary bombs were dropped on a hospital, but it is not known if they ignited. Judging from the sounds of explosions heard in the suburbs, German planes dropped high-explosive bombs larger than before. The three air raids on London between noon and 6:00 PM caused citizens to repeatedly take refuge in air-raid shelters. The authorities acknowledged that some people were killed.</p>
<p>It was reported that last night, in addition to the London area, eleven cities, including three cities in the Midlands and southeastern England, one city in southwestern England, and one city each in the northwest, northeast, and Wales, were also overflown by German planes. When London issued the third alert yesterday afternoon, twenty German bombers flying very high soon appeared. A group of British fighter planes attacked head-on, breaking through the German formation and cutting off several German bombers from the rest, and an air battle ensued. A Reuters reporter standing on high ground in the north watched the battle and saw a German plane in the clear sky trying to shake off two British fighter planes closely pursuing it. The British planes aimed and fired a barrage of guns. In a few seconds, the German plane was hit and crashed behind the trees in a burst of smoke. After a while, thick smoke rose from the area.</p>
<p>During the second air raid yesterday, fierce anti-aircraft fire and bomb explosions were heard in the area. The alert in the London area lasted fifty minutes. After the all-clear, residents thronged the streets in the suburbs to purchase goods in preparation for another air raid. During the second air raid, a fierce battle occurred over a city in the Surrey area. A German bomber was shot down, and three crew members parachuted out and were captured. Two of them were injured and taken to the hospital. Another German plane was severely damaged and is believed to have crashed before returning to its base. Twelve high-explosive bombs were dropped on a sparsely populated area, killing an old man and slightly injuring several others. (Reuters, 31st)</p>
<p>Berlin Suffers Heavy Air Raid</p>
<p>Berlin – Berlin suffered its most intense air raid today since the start of the war. Between 11:39 AM and 3:16 PM today, British planes dropped countless bombs on the city. After the all-clear, Berlin Police Chief Daluge, accompanied by several foreign reporters, inspected various parts of the city and declared that this air raid was the most vicious attack the German capital had suffered. The police chief said that the bombs dropped by the British planes and the damage suffered by the city were more severe than those of Thursday morning. This was the longest air raid in days. A large squadron of British planes invaded the city's airspace and suddenly penetrated the inner defenses. Anti-aircraft guns opened fire three minutes before the alert was issued. The British Air Force dropped countless bombs and incendiary bombs this time. Many parts of central Berlin and residential areas were hit by bombs. (United Press, 31st)</p>
<p>German Krupp Factory Bombed</p>
<p>London – British planes attacking Germany bombed the Krupp factory in Essen with high-explosive bombs and incendiary bombs. According to the pilot leading the squadron, there were four large explosions and two smaller explosions after the bombs were dropped, followed by a large fire and then two more violent explosions. The pilots who bombed the Cologne oil refinery witnessed a fire on the ground. Another squadron of planes bombed the Duisburg power plant, also causing a fire. In addition, several other targets were attacked with success. Bombers operating in France repeatedly hit the Saint-Nazaire oil depot, causing several large explosions. Yesterday afternoon, British planes also attacked enemy ships at several locations, bombing fourteen fishing boats and one larger ship at an altitude of 1,000 feet. Bombs landed between ships and the docks in Wobendoff. Several minesweepers were also bombed in the ports of Danzig. (Reuters, 31st)</p>
<p>German Side Announces Air Force Results</p>
<p>Berlin – This afternoon's German military report stated that yesterday the German Air Force attacked airfields and barracks in England. Several bombs fell on the barracks in southern England. During the attack, British planes took off to engage, and fierce battles ensued many times. Last night, German planes attacked port facilities, armament factories, and oil depots at the mouth of the Thames in central England, causing several large fires. Last night, British planes bombed Berlin again, and several bombs fell in the working-class district, without significant effect. One civilian was killed and several were injured. In summary, the result of yesterday's air battles was that ninety-two enemy planes were shot down. Subsequently, when British planes attacked Germany, one was shot down by anti-aircraft guns and two were shot down by German fighters. The navy shot down two British planes. Therefore, the total loss of enemy planes yesterday reached as many as ninety-eight. Thirty-four German planes are missing. A German submarine sank three merchant ships in a convoy west of Hebrides, totaling 29,000 tons, including an oil tanker weighing 12,000 tons. (Haitong Telegram, 31st)</p>
<h3>British Report Göring's Son Killed in Action, German Officials Deny It</h3>
<p>A Certain Seaport in Southeastern England – British defense leaders here reported last night that German Aviation Minister Göring, who is Hitler's most promising successor, may have been killed when his plane was shot down during a German air raid here. They claimed that among the dead pilots in a German plane destroyed in the sea here, one was as large as Göring and was covered with various badges. It is said that the body resembling Göring was not buried with the other three, and the body has been transported to London to further confirm its identity. (United Press, 31st)</p>
<p>Berlin – Authorities refused to announce the whereabouts of Aviation Minister General Göring last night, but said, "His health is better than ever." "German officials deny the rumor that General Göring was shot down in a plane off the British coast yesterday." (United Press, 31st)</p>
<h3>French Cabinet Reports on Far East Situation</h3>
<p>Vichy – The French Cabinet held a Council of State today, presided over by Marshal Pétain. First, Cabinet Associate Laval reported on his trip to Paris to meet with German military authorities. The Council of State then heard reports on the Far East situation, the current situation of French colonies in Africa, and New Caledonia, a French territory in Oceania. Finally, it passed resolutions appointing several senior officials of various ministries and governors of various provinces, and decided to expand the scope of the July 17 order on the retirement age of officials, so that it would apply to officials of provincial and municipal governments.

<p>European War Talks (1)</p>
<h3>Churchill: A Young Man's Romance</h3>
<p>This European war has inadvertently reached its one-year anniversary on the 3rd of this month. The final victory remains uncertain. Dr. Butler, the president of Columbia University, once said, "This war is a world war. Whoever wins or loses will determine two civilizations, two ways of life, two forms of government, and the ideals of society. If the outcome is unfavorable to us, the global situation will regress for decades; if it is favorable to us, we can restore true liberalism and lead the world in progress and peace." To enable readers to deeply understand the true situation of this European war, this newspaper has successively published two translated works, "Background of the European War" and "True Record of the European War." However, modern total warfare involves a wide range and is very complex. The materials collected by reporters from various European and American countries are inexhaustible. This newspaper has selected the essence and translated it into more than twenty articles, with many photos attached, collectively titled "Conversations on the European War." The sources of these materials have either been preserved for a long time or just received. They are based on an objective attitude, directly and indirectly revealing the truth of the European war situation. The following is a preliminary disclosure of the catalog: the British section includes (1) Churchill's youth romance (2) British folk life on the eve of the war (3) Churchill's American mother; the German section includes (1) Hitler's destitute youth (2) An analysis of Germany's total mobilization in the past seven years (3) Germany's huge military expenditure (4) Hitler's triumph (5) Hitler's personal life; the French section includes (1) The day Paris fell (2) From Paris to Bordeaux (3) Tragedy in the Forest of Compiègne (4) The "Vichy Old Man's" dilemma; the other sections include (1) The current situation in the occupied areas of various countries (2) Espionage panic in European and American countries (3) The inside story of the fall of Norway (4) An overview of the Mediterranean war situation (5) "Altmark" attacked (6) Warsaw's last diary (7) The Czech's passive resistance (8) An Austrian writer's escape (9) Gandhi's letter to Hitler (10) An overview of America's war preparations. The translated articles will be published daily. If new materials are discovered, they will be inserted at any time so that readers can get a glimpse of the whole picture.</p>
<p>The following is the first article, describing the romance of British wartime Prime Minister Churchill in his youth. The so-called "Romance" is the transliteration of the English word "Romance."</p>
<p>Prime Minister Churchill, known as the "Iron Man" of Britain, came from a noble family. His ancestors and father held prominent official positions. His mother was the daughter of an American wealthy man, with a beautiful appearance and extraordinary talent. The family environment can be said to be wealthy. However, he did not have the habits of a rich young master. From childhood to adulthood to entering officialdom, he showed his extraordinary vitality, full of adventurous spirit, not avoiding dangers, and daring to take responsibility. He was indeed born with extraordinary talents, which ordinary people could not match.</p>
<p>In total, since he engaged in political life, he has been transferred to nine positions in the cabinet: he has been a member of the Conservative Party cabinet and also served as a member of the Liberal Party cabinet. Although there was a temporary retirement, he still maintained the spirit of progress and perseverance during his days in opposition, which is his unique feature.</p>
<p>He has been a journalist, writer, and military strategist. He came from a triple military background; his literary cultivation and achievements are unmatched by most politicians. Since Prime Minister Disraeli of Britain, Churchill is the only cabinet elder who can be famous for his writing. As for the wonderfulness of his daily conversation and the touchingness of his speeches, it seems that they were "taught by extraordinary people."</p>
<p>During the last World War, he commanded a large team of infantry on the French front line; and for a period, he was fascinated by military aviation and flew planes himself. After retiring from the army, he also took time to write and completed many volumes; the landscape watercolor paintings he made at the age of forty were admired by his family. His life is full of changes and his energy is abundant. He is indeed a "typical figure of the romantic imperialist" of Great Britain.</p>
<p>During the period when Hitler was working hard, the British executives were furious as if in a dream. Churchill, this "old loner", was "good at observing the situation". He was shouting there alone, and now his "prophecies" have all come true. He urged the government and the public to come out of the mountains and lead the ill-prepared British people to fight. He really reported to the country in time, but seeing the beautiful life and brilliant days he had spent in his youth, one cannot help but feel the contrast between the past and the present.</p>
<p>When Churchill was a child, his father followed the Duke of Marlborough to serve in Ireland, and he left when he was four years old. His mother was the daughter of New York businessman Jerome (see "Churchill's American Mother" later). In 1880, Churchill was seven years old and preparing to go to school. At that time, people said he was a "naughty child."</p>
<p>The first school he entered was Eton School, which imitated the British aristocracy. If there was a fault, whipping would come immediately. After two years of suffering, he looked forward to coming out early every day. Later, due to his weak health and frequent illnesses, in order to facilitate medical care, he transferred to a school run by two female teachers in Brighton. The atmosphere there was gentle and kind, which was completely different from the first school.</p>
<p>He entered Harrow School at the age of twelve. During the exam, he handed in a blank paper for the Latin test questions, but the principal finally allowed him to enter the school based on his general academic ability. Churchill recalled his situation in school and said, "My name is Spencer Churchill, and the first letter is S. My ranking is in the very back row, the third from the bottom. The last two dropped out of school due to illness. That was in 1887. My father, Lord Randolph Churchill, although he had resigned from the positions of Speaker of the House of Commons and Treasurer, still held power in the political world. Therefore, many visitors often stood on the steps of the school and watched me walk in a line; I often heard them whispering, 'What, he is actually the bottom of the school!'"</p>
<p>In school for a year, other students liked to read Latin and Greek, but he thought he had self-knowledge and only read English, so he laid a good foundation. Later, he was admitted to the Harrow School Army Class, and he thought that half of it was due to luck. He said, "We all know that we have to draw a map silently during the exam. When I was making the final preparations the night before, I wrote many map names on pieces of paper and put them in my hat, and then I took out a piece of paper with 'New Zealand' on it and desperately memorized the geography of New Zealand. The next day, the first question on the test paper was actually 'Try to draw a map of New Zealand'."</p>
<p>Churchill liked to play war games since he was a child. He collected as many as 1,500 toy soldiers, forming an infantry division and a cavalry brigade. One day, his father went to watch him command these toy soldiers to fight for twenty minutes. In the end, his father asked him if he was willing to join the army. Churchill immediately replied "willing". So these toy soldiers changed his life. Afterwards, his education was aimed at passing the entrance examination for the Army University in Sandhurst, and he finally entered the cavalry department of the school. He recalled his school life, except for winning a medal for fencing, most of it was ordinary.</p>
<p>At the Army University, he started learning everything again. The Latin, French, and mathematics that he had previously abandoned did not affect him. He regarded horsemanship as particularly profound and interesting. He advocated that a group of fathers and brothers, especially wealthy families, "should not give money to their sons, but give them horses." In the blink of an eye, it was graduation time again. Churchill, who had always been unable to escape the "bottom of the list", actually ranked eighth out of 150 students in this exam. In December 1894, he finished his studies and returned home, and was already qualified to serve as an officer.</p>
<p>The next short five years were uneventful, but it was an interesting center in his life, and everything he experienced was worthy of a variety of things. At the age of twenty-one, he joined the Hussars Cavalry and received training as a reserve officer. Various courses were several times stricter than when he was in school. He spent all day learning horsemanship: getting on the horse, getting off the horse, galloping, trotting, jumping over obstacles, and sprinting, without exception. Churchill originally loved horsemanship, and at this point, he felt even more happy.</p>
<p>The following spring, the Hussars Cavalry was preparing to fill the defense in India in the autumn, and the officers were given leave to handle miscellaneous affairs. Churchill had five good horses, so he used this period to play polo games. At that time, British political and business leaders regarded horse racing as a major event, and the lively situation stirred up the entire London. This was exactly what Churchill liked, and he went to almost every event and had a great time.</p>
<p>During this holiday, he learned a lesson. According to his own record: "At the end of a certain week, I was invited to attend the grand banquet of the Prince of Wales as a second lieutenant of the army, and I felt it was a great honor. I understood very well that I must attend on time, and my manners must be elegant and generous—in short, show all the virtues. Unexpectedly, when I arrived, the guests and hosts had already gathered in the living room, and the number of people seemed to be thirteen, except for me. Everyone knows that the royal family is unwilling to be careless about the number thirteen. The prince clearly refused to take his seat. He arrived on time at 8:30 as scheduled, and now it was twelve minutes before nine o'clock. In the large living room, standing this angry guest, on the one hand, came this young man who was looked at differently by others. I felt very embarrassed and could only stammer a few words, and gave a bow. The prince sternly scolded: 'Winston, don't they teach you to be punctual in your team?' I really felt very scared! The two of us walked into the restaurant side by side, and sat down with exactly fourteen people. Later, this kind-hearted prince said a few words to me to show his kindness, so that I felt relieved." From then on, he tried his best to maintain the virtue of punctuality.</p>
<p>The Hussars Cavalry, with 1,200 people, boarded a transport ship and set off from Southampton. It took twenty-three days to reach Mumbai.</p>
<p>Serving in the army in India, the salary and treatment were better than in the country, and the officers' food, clothing, and daily life were taken care of by servants. Churchill's team was stationed in Bangalore for three years.</p>
<p>In the winter of 1896, he was twenty-two years old, and his desire for knowledge was strong. He wrote to his mother for many history, philosophy, and economics books, and used the time to rest during the day to study diligently, chew on them, and humbly accept them for two years. Then he returned to the country for a three-month vacation. At this time, the Pazhtun tribesmen on the Indian border rebelled. He had long wanted to visit the war situation in person, so he asked his superiors to allow him to accompany the 3rd Brigade of the field army on the expedition, and also served as a military reporter for the London Forward Post. His mother also contacted the London Daily Telegraph and published his communications on schedule.</p>
<p>Churchill returned to Bangalore. At the station, he was stunned to find out that the journey to Nowshera (where the headquarters of the field army was located) was 2,028 miles. He thought to himself, India is so big! After taking the train for five days in the hot weather to the railway terminal, he took a 40-mile carriage ride to report to the headquarters.</p>
<p>The first time the British First Brigade clashed with the natives, forty officers and soldiers were killed or injured in one watch, and many horses were killed. The Second Brigade rushed to support.</p>
<p>The next morning, the Second Brigade began to fight, with about 1,200 people, and launched a fan-shaped attack in three routes. Churchill was assigned to the middle route and galloped to the farthest end of the valley. On the way, he led a team of Indian soldiers to attack a small village on the mountainside. He recorded the scene at that time as follows: "I handed the horse to the natives and led the Indian soldiers to climb the mountainside. The midday sun was scorching hot. Except for a few shots fired on the mountain, everything was still quiet. At around eleven o'clock, I suddenly wondered why I couldn't see our army. Two or three hours ago, the large team of 1,200 people was in progress, but now it seemed to have been swallowed by the valley. I was young and liked to be nosy, and I was afraid that something would go wrong. Sure enough, something went wrong!" Not long after, Churchill and a team of Indian soldiers were ordered to retreat. Suddenly, swords and bullets gradually approached, and the enemy came from top to bottom, and it seemed that they were about to reach the feet. Eight Indian soldiers tried their best to fire back, and as a result, two were killed and three were injured. Fortunately, an officer arrived with a few soldiers to help everyone rescue the injured soldiers. Churchill then described the situation at that time: "The officer was shot. The four soldiers under him carried him away. At this time, five or six Pazhtuns with large knives flashed out from the side. The four soldiers also ignored the wounded and rolled off the stretcher and fled. The leading Pazhtun rushed to the side of the stretcher, raised the large knife and quickly chopped the dying officer three or four times. Seeing this, I forgot everything and vowed to kill this bandit. I aimed and fired, one shot, no movement, two shots, no result, three shots, I don't know if I hit it, I only saw the native retreating three or four yards and rolling down from the rock. At this time, the sound of gunfire was still dense. I looked around, and I didn't see a single one of our own people, so I ran desperately, and bullets flew from all directions. I finally ran to a small hill. Our Indian soldiers had already occupied a low hill! After a while, I was with them."</p>
<p>Before long, the natives retreated. Our army was ordered to destroy the village huts and trees in the valley into a flat ground. Each time we attacked a village, we lost two or three British officers and soldiers, and fifteen to twenty Indian soldiers. After two weeks of fighting, we returned to the camp in triumph. That winter, I used the communications published by the London Daily Telegraph as a blueprint to write my first book. After Christmas, I sent the original manuscript to London, and my mother sold it to a bookstore for publication. It was called The Malakand Field Force, and it was very popular with readers.

<h3>German and Italian Authorities Announce Resolution of Hungarian-Romanian Dispute; Axis Powers Guarantee Romanian Territorial Integrity and Inviolability; Romania Suffers Significant Territorial Loss and Economic Damage</h3>
<p>Vienna - German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and Italian Foreign Minister Ciano, on behalf of the German and Italian governments, issued a declaration stating that the Romanian and Hungarian governments have appealed to the German and Italian governments for arbitration to resolve the issue of territorial cession to Hungary. Based on the promises made by the Romanian and Hungarian governments in their petitions, stating that both parties would consider any arbitration as the final solution without any reservations, the two foreign ministers, after discussions in Vienna with the Romanian and Hungarian foreign ministers, have arbitrated as follows: (1) The determined border between Hungary and Romania shall be divided according to the attached map, the detailed sections of which shall be determined freely by the Romanian and Hungarian governments. (2) Romanian troops must withdraw from the territory ceded to Hungary within two weeks, and the transfer must be maintained in good condition. The various detailed methods and procedures for withdrawal and occupation shall be decided immediately by the Romanian-Hungarian Committee. The withdrawal and occupation of both sides must be orderly. (3) Romanian citizens currently residing in the ceded territory will naturally become Hungarian citizens, but within six months they may petition to become Romanian nationals, but they must leave Hungarian territory within one year and be received by Romania. Their movable property and items converted from immovable property may be taken away. If their immovable property cannot be sold, the Hungarian government shall compensate them. The Hungarian government should handle various issues arising after withdrawal and occupation with a magnanimous and harmonious attitude. (4) Hungarian citizens currently residing in the land ceded by Hungary to Romania in 1919 may also petition to become Hungarian nationals within six months. The rights to which such repatriated persons are entitled are the same as those stipulated in the previous article. (5) The Hungarian government shall bear the solemn obligation to allow persons referred to in this arbitration to restore Hungarian nationality, and whether they are Romanians, they shall be given the same rights as Hungarian nationals. The Romanian government shall also bear this responsibility for Hungarian nationals of Romanian nationality who remain within Romanian territory. (6) Other issues arising from the transfer of sovereignty shall be negotiated directly by the Hungarian and Romanian governments. (7) If difficulties or doubts arise in the implementation of this arbitration plan, they shall be negotiated directly by Hungary and Romania. If they cannot agree on any issue, it shall be submitted to the German and Italian governments for resolution. (Haitong Telegram, 31st)</p>
<p>Vienna - After the Vienna arbitration case concluded, the German and Italian foreign ministers exchanged notes with the Romanian foreign minister, the content of which stipulated that the German and Italian governments would guarantee Romania's territorial integrity and inviolability. The Romanian government has accepted this guarantee. The territory ceded by Romania to Hungary is estimated to be 45,000 square kilometers. (Haitong Telegram, 31st)</p>
<p>Viking - After Romania succumbed to the ultimatum from the Axis powers, the first reaction here was one of shock, as Romania's deception over the Outer Transylvania incident was astonishing. Romania has lost land with 2.75 million residents, including 1.5 million Romanians and 1 million Hungarians, while Hungary has gained a huge mountain range extending into Romania. According to reliable sources, Germany has heavily concentrated troops in P沃尔 and along the Soviet border of occupied Poland. Well-informed sources in Romania now expect German troops to occupy several strategic locations in Outer Transylvania to prevent serious incidents. It is now known that Germany demanded that Romania accept its arbitration conditions, but did not notify its representatives of the arbitration method. There was fierce debate when the Privy Council was held, and it was heard that at least one participant claimed that if Romania succumbed without a struggle, a revolution might break out within the country. Romania's loss of Outer Transylvania is a major blow in terms of industry and economy, while Hungary has gained a very large wheat-producing area and the Beimeier gold mine. Most of Romania's western defenses will also be destroyed as a result. Romania's loss of South Dobruja is far more serious than what can be compared today. According to the Vienna Agreement, Romania must withdraw from the ceded territory within fourteen days. Details of the new border will be decided by the Romanian-Hungarian Mixed Committee. People in the Hungarian capital were greatly excited to hear about this agreement, and the absence of Soviet representatives at the Vienna Conference was a source of comment for people in the Hungarian capital.

<h3>Germany Concludes Agreements with Hungary and Romania on Minority Ethnic Groups; Hungary and Romania Guarantee that German Nationals within Their Borders Enjoy the Same Treatment as Their Own People</h3>
<p>Vienna - While the Hungarian-Romanian dispute was being negotiated here, Germany had concluded a draft agreement with Hungary on the future status of the German minority in Hungary. The draft has been signed and includes the German minority throughout Hungary, including the German minority in the territory arbitrated and ceded to Hungary. One of the most important points in the full text of the draft is that Hungary must grant the German minority the right to adhere to national traditions and recognize National Socialism. The German minority enjoys the right to organize associations, such as youth sports and cultural associations. Germans may serve in all sectors of Hungary and enjoy the same treatment as Hungarians. Germans may also be elected as officials based on the number of people in the minority. Children of Germans should receive the same education in German schools. Germans may use their native language in public gatherings and may not restrict German publications. In each administrative district where Germans account for one-third of the residents, German may also be used in official correspondence. Germans may use the names of their German families. The draft does not affect the obligation of the German minority to be loyal to Hungary. Special provisions are made for the German minority in the territory ceded by Romania to Hungary. Germans in this area may move to Germany and may submit this request within two years of signing the draft. They may take their movable property with them without restriction, and they may liquidate their immovable property in cash. All detailed programs will be negotiated separately by Germany and Hungary. (Haitong Telegram, 31st)</p>
<p>Vienna - The German-Romanian draft agreement on the future status of the German minority in Romania was signed here yesterday, the contents of which are as follows: "The Romanian government guarantees that the German minority in its territory enjoys the same status as Romanians, and promotes the status of the German minority in the spirit of the Carlsbad Resolution." (Haitong Telegram, 31st)</p>
<h3>Romanian Foreign Minister Resigns; Cabinet's Position Shaken</h3>
<p>Romania - It was widely rumored here yesterday that Romanian Foreign Minister Manolescu had submitted his resignation after the Romanian-Hungarian agreement was signed in Vienna. It is believed that the Foreign Minister's resignation was a procedure to allow the Romanian cabinet to be reorganized. (United Telegram, 31st)</p>
<p>Romania - After the Axis powers sent an "ultimatum" to Romania and the arbitration was issued in Vienna, people here believed that there would be major changes in the Romanian government in an instant. It is believed that the Gigurtu cabinet has obviously been given by its pro-Axis policy. The Romanian people initially thought that their government would change its course and collude with the Axis powers to make profits, but today they feel betrayed. It is generally felt that even if the government is replaced and the peasant leader Maniu is appointed as the Prime Minister, it is now too late. Maniu talked with King Carol of Romania for several hours last night, but the official did not announce anything about it. The King of Romania and the ministers considered the conditions of the Axis powers overnight. The ministers seemed to have no choice but to resign and apologize for this "another huge sale by Germany". It is not impossible for Germany to occupy Outer Transylvania, as the Axis powers know very well that if Hungary immediately occupies the area, it may cause a fierce battle. Except for seeing the official report yesterday acknowledging that the civil organs in the Soviet-Romanian border area have withdrawn, the Romanian people are completely unaware of the Soviet-Romanian border incident. According to the latest news from the border, the situation has returned to tranquility, and the Soviet army that opened fire on the Romanian troops has returned to its original position.

<h3>Hungarian Delegation Returns Home; Crowds Give Warm Welcome</h3>
<p>Hungary - Hungarian Prime Minister Teleki and cabinet member Szaky have made great contributions to Hungary's acquisition of Outer Transylvania from Romania. Therefore, when they arrived here from Vienna last night, they received a warm welcome from the people. In addition to the Hungarian flag, the streets were full of German and Italian flags. The crowds gathered and demonstrated in front of the German and Italian embassies. According to the Prime Minister, Hungary's desire for compensation exceeded expectations.

<p>Rome - The date of [Foreign Minister] Ciano's swift return to Rome is likely to be postponed due to ongoing discussions between the foreign ministers of Germany and Italy. (Haitong Telegraph, 31st)</p>
<p>Negotiations Between Romania and Bulgaria Still Have Details to Resolve</p>
<p>Sofia - According to well-informed sources here, the Bulgarian cabinet held a meeting yesterday to discuss the proposals made by Romania in the Romanian-Bulgarian talks, especially regarding economic issues. Although the compensation demanded by Romania has been reduced from 15,000,000 Bulgarian levs to 10,000,000 Bulgarian levs, the Bulgarian side still considers it too high. (Reuters, 31st)</p>

<h3>National Elementary School to be Established in Weining: Promoting Education for the Miao People, Currently Being Prepared for Opening This Year</h3>
<p>(Guiyang Dispatch) The central authorities also believe that church education in Weining (a county in the extreme west of Guizhou) cannot be ignored. The central and provincial authorities have paid attention to and reformed the Shimenkan area, which has taken on a new appearance. In the Miao areas of Weining County, church schools still account for the majority. In order to promote education for the Miao people, it is heard that a national elementary school will be established in Weining. According to Yu Qiansheng, Chief Secretary of the Provincial Department of Education, "Mr. Guo Lianfeng, Section Chief of the Frontier Affairs Section of the Ministry of Education, returned to Chongqing after inspecting education in Weining. He believes that church education has several decades of history and a gradually consolidated foundation in the Miao area of Weining County, especially in the Shimenkan area, but its educational methods do not fully comply with regulations. Therefore, he suggested establishing a national elementary school. The Ministry of Education adopted this suggestion, sent a principal, and began preparations. The school is named 'National Weining County Central Experimental Elementary School,' a complete elementary school with both higher and lower grades, larger in scale than ordinary complete elementary schools. Preparations may be completed after the summer vacation, and it will open within the year. The establishment of this national Miao school is not only to promote education for the Miao people but also to conduct an experiment in frontier education. There are already more than 20 provincial Miao elementary schools in the Miao areas of various counties in this province, but they are still insufficient due to economic and other reasons. Now that the Ministry of Education is allocating funds to establish a national Miao school under very difficult financial circumstances, people in the educational circles of this province are also very excited."</p>

<h3>Food: Imported Rice Leaps to Ceiling Price; All Rice Soars... Food for People Becomes More Difficult</h3>
<p>After two days of consecutive soaring prices for imported rice, the Rice Price Evaluation Committee, disregarding the rice inventory situation in Shanghai and accommodating the facts, only cared about protecting the interests of the goods owners, and did not ask about the difficulties of the public's livelihood. It specifically increased the price by two yuan, making speculators feel even more justified. Returned original packages are not within the limit, making it impossible to stop the price increase. For a time, everyone competed to buy and hoard, releasing and then collecting. Prices soared in an instant, all reaching the assessed price. In other words, they rose by two yuan. At the close, Grade One Chen Saigon and Siamese rice was 61.5 yuan, new pointed rice was 60.08 yuan, Grade Two was 59 yuan, and fire-refined rice was 61 yuan. The opening price for Grade Two Saigon rice was 68 yuan the day before yesterday, and 70 yuan was asked for later without success. Yesterday, the opening price was 71.5 yuan, then increasing from two yuan to two and a half yuan, which is a rise of four and a half yuan from the previously opened 68 yuan. Small-refined rice was 70 yuan, up 2.4 yuan, and Grade Two Siamese rice rose from 70.05 yuan to 72.5 yuan, also a rise of three yuan. It is estimated that more than 500 tons were traded. Apart from rice shops being nervous and competing to buy, most of it was absorbed by hoarders, and the total transaction volume was more than 13,400 bags.</p>
<p>As the arrival of glutinous rice was scarce, the sales market suddenly became active. Not only did cake shops and rice vendors prepare in advance due to the soaring rice market, but also large households hoarded it, creating a situation of supply falling short of demand. Goods owners all regarded it as a rare commodity, and customers did not flinch despite the high price. The selling price was as much as three or four yuan higher than the previous market. Jinli special grade was priced at 67-68 yuan, and Changdan goods also required 65-66 yuan, while Hong Kong special grade and domestic glutinous rice were both 67-68 yuan, ordinary was 65-66 yuan, and next to polished rice was 61-62 yuan.</p>
<p>The source of Guomi rice such as thick and thin Geng rice, apart from thin rice, has been exhausted from the inland reserves and has not arrived for a long time. Yesterday, only 600 bags of thick Geng and early rice arrived. With the sudden interruption of imported rice and the scarcity of domestic rice, the market sentiment became even stronger. The prices opened were accompanied by a violent price surge in other goods, with increases of two or three yuan. Common ordinary white Geng rice from Changxu has reached 72 yuan. As for fresh special goods, there were no samples. White Geng rice from Suzhou and Kunshan in Changzhou was priced at 70 yuan, down to 66-67 yuan. Fresh original-packaged early rice from Fugang also opened above the 70 yuan mark, with the bushel seeing 66.5-66 yuan.</p>
<p>As the new Jing rice from Zhoupu is still limited in supply due to the erratic autumn rains, there are only 35 dan, and the demand from customers is even more urgent. Therefore, it is difficult to cope with the limited market goods, and only a few dan are distributed to each. The opening price also rose sharply by about two yuan, to 66.5-66 yuan. In short, there is no exception to the price surge in the market, which is a misfortune for people's food.</p>
<h3>Flour Prices Also Aroused</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market was aroused because the price of rice exceeded the limit. Speculators buying and hoarding futures of Phoenix brand flour from Japanese mills were endless, with transactions reaching more than 10,000 bags. The opening price for September was 14.9 yuan to 9.5 yuan, and for October was 15.1 yuan to 1.5 yuan, a further increase of one jiao compared to the previous day. However, the price of Huafen factory was stable and did not move. Imported flour was 16.4-5 yuan, and domestic flour was 14.7-8 yuan. There was no shortage of spot supply, but actual sales were not strong. The market can only stand firm.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday's transactions had nothing particularly exciting to say. Because it was difficult for Huafen factory to purchase, there were no large-scale purchases except for occasional scattered additions. Japanese factories were still unwilling to lower prices to absorb them, and the sellers mostly stayed put in the face of scarce arrivals and rising prices. As a result, Sanxin factory and others still purchased more than 3,000 bags of wheat from each car and boat, priced at 21.5 yuan to 21 yuan.</p>
<h3>Oil Cake: Soybean Oil Source is Connected; Raw Oil Abandoned Road Goods; Total Number is No Less Than 20,000</h3>
<p>The oil market is completely manipulated by speculation. At the moment, the source of soybean oil has been connected, and market sentiment has suddenly declined. The market price immediately announced a decline. The road goods abandoned by raw oil have not yet arrived. Most traders think there is still business to be done, so the market wind has turned upward again. However, recalling that the original factory abandoned road goods, the total number is no less than 20,000. According to the sluggish sales market now, the future changes may be greater than the ups and downs of soybean oil. Yesterday, a total of 50 barrels of Dalian soybean oil were traded, priced at 97 yuan to 97.5 yuan. 500 dan of Dayouyu factory soybean oil were mostly returned transactions, priced at 75 yuan to 74.5 yuan, and 150 pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil were priced at 62.5 yuan. The total transaction volume from the first half of September to the second half of October was 600 pieces, and the prices all opened at 62 yuan.</p>
<h3>Finance: Foreign Exchange Buyers Crowd the Market, But Futures Have Been Squared</h3>

Following this, due to the urgent needs of speculators and foreign firms, although foreign firms such as British and American firms were willing to fill in, the price was surprisingly soft due to the shortage of position.

<h3>Jin Shurong's Commentary</h3>
<p>— Sheng Kaiqiong</p>
<p>Why is the Foreign Exchange Tightening?</p>
<p>The black market exchange rate of the legal tender has been declining for the past two weeks, with the US dollar falling from above 5.59375 yuan to below 5.5 yuan, seeing 5.28125 yuan at the end of the month; the English gold has also decreased from 3 pence and 70125 to 3 pence and 59375. The market price of gold has also been drastically increased to beyond 6,200 yuan.</p>
<p>It seems that the basic factors affecting the exchange market stem from the tense situation in Vietnam, while the rumor that the Ministry of Finance will revise the commercial exchange rate can only be regarded as a rumor. Since the Ministry of Finance formulated the commercial exchange rate in 1939, export merchants have repeatedly requested the Ministry of Finance to abandon the 7-pence commercial exchange rate and revise it to a price closer to the black market level. However, the authorities believed that if it approached the black market, there would inevitably be frequent fluctuations and inconsistent rises and falls. Once the commercial exchange rate is close to the black market, it will be revised from time to time, which is not beneficial to export merchants, and it will hinder the work of the state in controlling export trade and collecting export foreign exchange. Therefore, it was finally set at 7 pence for more than a year. However, after a year, the exchange rate of 4 and a half pence was re-established according to the results shown by the statistical figures and the changes in the environment. The situation of the 4 and a half pence exchange rate for export trade and foreign exchange collection has not yet been discovered from the statistics, and there have been no major changes in the environment. To say that the commercial exchange rate will be changed to 3 pence is an overreaction! It should be known that although the commercial exchange rate can be changed at any time, "at any time" is subject to conditions. The most important thing is to know for sure that it hinders export trade and foreign exchange collection before it can be changed at any time.</p>
<p>As for the situation in Vietnam, the market has repeatedly spread rumors that the Japanese army is preventing landings in Shanghai, but the Japanese army has not yet stepped on Vietnamese soil. At the same time, at present, the basic policy of the Chinese government, apart from hoping that Vietnam will not be used by Japan, is to resist aggression, so it is only deploying troops on the Vietnamese-Yunnan border and adopting a policy of regardless of the attitude of the Vietnamese government, if the Japanese army enters Vietnam, then China's war of anti-aggression will occur in Vietnam. Although the situation in Vietnam is serious, it is not yet known what the benefits and harms will be for China. Speculators purchased August futures at prices above 3.8 pence and around 6 yuan in July. At the time, they took advantage of the revision of the commercial exchange rate and the issue of the Shanghai garrison to profit. Now they want to take advantage of the situation in Vietnam to pluck in foreign exchange, hoping to make a fortune from the country's difficulties due to unfavorable developments in this regard.</p>
<h3>Since the Highest Price Was Discovered in May and Has Fallen Back, Yesterday's Gold Price Was About in the Middle — Highest Seen at $6,220 —</h3>
<p>Yesterday, cash "heated red" (a term for gold speculation) trading in the unofficial market saw a resurgence of buying, with high prices repeatedly emerging. The closing price had already exceeded the $6,200 mark. Given the tight exchange rates reported, operators would not willingly give up this bullish opportunity and increased their purchases, which had been prepared for some time. Although some profit-taking and liquidation of long positions occurred, the impact was still slight. It is noted that on May 6th of this year, the gold price had reached a high of $7,250. Subsequently, due to the tension of the European war and the ceasefire in the Netherlands and Belgium, a sudden reaction arose, and the price gradually fell back to $4,910 by July 5th. Yesterday morning, the market opened at $6,060. Securities firms and gold dealers took the lead in pushing the price up to $6,120. Later, money changers released some holdings, causing a slight drop of $20 or $30. Subsequently, news of tight foreign exchange rates spread quickly, and banks and gold dealers aggressively raised prices, soon reaching a peak of $6,220. At that time, retail investors and others entered the market, and the buying momentum was quite strong. Before the close, there was a slight setback, but the result was still a closing price of $6,210, a substantial increase of $175 compared to the previous day. If considering the drop from the highest price discovered in May, yesterday's gold price was in the middle. In the afternoon, there was no Wednesday market, but half-day trading was still brisk, with about 4,000 taels traded. Silver jewelry shops finally raised prices by $10, while customs gold and other types remained unchanged.</p>
<p>"Heated Red" Rises by $175</p>
<p>Since the morning, the market sentiment for each "bar" (ten taels) was quite good. Gold dealers took the lead in raising prices and buying, with money changers taking in 50 taels at $6,060, $25 higher than the closing price from the day before yesterday. Subsequently, due to the tight foreign exchange rates, the buying interest became stronger. Securities firms and banks competed to absorb holdings, and the price immediately rose by $60. Securities firms took in 10 taels at a high of $6,120. Suddenly, money changers came to sell short, and the price once dropped back to $6,090. After that, the buying momentum resumed, with gold dealers and banks again scrambling to acquire holdings. Moreover, Hong Kong firms were also active in the market, leading to another rise of $90. Gold dealers took in 30 taels from securities firms, raising the price to $6,180. Later, as the foreign exchange market stopped tightening and tended to stabilize, a temporary pullback occurred. Gold dealers and banks came to sell, causing the price to fall back to $6,135. Around 11 a.m., news of a tightening foreign exchange market spread again, and the buying momentum on the trading floor revived. Banks absorbed holdings aggressively, breaking through the $6,100 mark and reaching a high price of $6,120. At noon, a certain money changer with a short position increased their holdings at the high price, causing a drop of $30. However, due to the excitement of retail investors, the closing price was still $6,210, resulting in an increase of $175 compared to the previous day. After the close, news suddenly spread that an American warship had sailed to the Pacific, causing considerable selling pressure. Gold dealers and banks intervened, and the price finally retreated to $6,140. In the afternoon, the situation outside the market was still stable, and transactions were made at $6,170. The fluctuation was $160 in half a day. The selling price of cash gold by gold dealers was more than ten dollars higher than "heated red," while the buying price was more than thirty dollars lower. Currently, margin gold is quoted $50 or $60 lower than the listed gold price, and there is little trading activity.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Raises by $10</p>
<p>At the beginning, the jewelry gold quoted by Da Tong Hang was still $620 per tael for sales. Around 10 a.m., it was raised by $10, and there were no further changes. Da Tong Hang changed its quote to $630. The quote of the Xin Tong Hang was similar to that of Da Tong Hang, and the buying price was about $30 lower.</p>
<h3>British and American Gold Pounds Surge by $4</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw a resurgence of the "heated red" rise. British and American gold pounds surged by $4 each. There was still demand for British gold notes, and the market price rose slightly. The price of American gold notes once reached a high of $18.84, but later, due to rumors of an American warship sailing to the Pacific, it fell back to $18.70. In the afternoon, it rose again to $18.78, ultimately increasing by $0.36. There was considerable demand for Hong Kong notes, and the price increased by $0.05. In addition, there was also demand for Singapore notes and notes from Annam, Lobi, Canada, and the Philippines, and the market prices all rose in unison. The rise in Japanese gold notes had not waned, and the market price continued to advance. The evening market reached a high of $1.82, a further increase of $0.07 compared to the previous day. The demand for Korean notes was also strong, and the evening market continued to rise to $1.14.</p>
<h3>August Exchange and Deposit Interest Rate</h3>
<p>—$4.50 per Thousand— The Shanghai Banking Association Joint Reserve Committee has set the interbank exchange deposit interest rate for August at $4.50 per thousand (equivalent to a monthly interest rate of 4.5%), a decrease of $1.50 compared to July.</p>
<h3>Hidden Marks on the Face of the New Chinese Dime Notes</h3>
<p>The designs of the new dime and nickel subsidiary currency notes issued by the Bank of China have been described in detail in this newspaper. It is noted that the dime notes printed by the Bank of China this time have good paper, excellent printing, and all have hidden marks.

<h3>Securities: The Rise in Domestic Debt Continues Vigorously</h3>
<p>The rise in the securities unofficial market was fierce yesterday. Various types of securities have broken through the highest prices seen on July 16th and 17th, including interest. Investor sentiment was enthusiastic, and inventory was depleted. For a time, there were no sales from the warehouses, and sellers had no goods to deliver, so they negotiated with the buyers to borrow. This situation was initially discovered and was exploited by the bulls. Those with ample funds felt that the opportunity was rare and continued to absorb holdings. Although gold repeatedly soared, the debt market was not affected. Bulls increased their holdings, and shorts covered, leading to a flurry of activity. It can be seen that the fundamental reason is that large investors are increasingly enthusiastic, so the prospects for the debt market are still inevitably progressing with the times. The opening yesterday morning was flat. Tongkang, Lianhe, and Hengfu bought, and Xinfu liquidated slightly. Later, Dakangcheng suddenly had a large intake, and the market price turned from weak to firm. In the afternoon, buying interest surged. Tongkang and Lianhe continued to buy, and Shuntai, Hongda, and Lianyi also absorbed holdings vigorously. Yichang, Xinchang, and Tianfeng also had strong demand. Among them, bulls increased their holdings more often, and shorts covered less often. Hengkang and Yongkang either bought A and sold E, or bought A and sold C, choosing to profit. Jiufeng and Yitai still sold. Type C broke through the $3 mark, Type B broke through $6, Type A broke through $2, and Type E also approached $3, the new high price after the interest payment, breaking through the highest price including interest in July, a thriving and promising situation, truly the best atmosphere in recent months. The market price ended up rising by several dimes to about a dollar. Type D was not traded in the afternoon, so it only rose by $0.15. The total number of transactions was $1.5 million to $1.6 million. A simplified table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock trading: 50 shares of Bank of China stock were traded at a price of $65.50.</p>
<p>London, 30th (Friday) telegram: Today, the listed prices of Chinese foreign debt and Far East British company stocks were stagnant, and there were no changes in the market.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: The Yarn Market Is Heavily Burdened and Difficult to Recover; Inventory Is Thick and Outlets Are Blocked</h3>
<p>The yarn market is still in a state of hovering, with a mediocre trend. Although the foreign exchange rate has been seen to fall, the yarn market has not been able to rise with it. This is because inventory is thick, and transportation is difficult and slow. The outlets for yarn sales have been greatly affected, so people's hearts are seeking stimulation, and the market is in a hesitant state.</p>
<p>The opening of current yarn this morning was calm, because yarn sales were very narrow, and long positions continued to be sold. The opening price for 20-count Shuangma was $960. Subsequently, news of a shrinking US exchange rate and soaring gold spread, and speculators became active again, unanimously scooping up holdings, rising from $960 directly to $972. However, although the shouting on the floor was tense, there were still few new buyers. In fact, the sales market was lacking, and the price fell again to $970.05 at the close. It is noted that the statistics for half-day transactions totaled 1,955 bales. The market for 20-count Shuangma fell by $5. Today, 330 pieces of cotton yarn were transported to Hong Kong. The amount bought by each guild is listed as follows:</p>
<h3>Jardine Matheson Cotton: Hongzhang Alone Takes in 100 Pieces</h3>
<p>The current cotton situation has entered a cooling-off period again. However, although exchange rates have shrunk, factories, due to the blocked sales outlets for yarn, are particularly cautious about purchasing raw materials, so the cost is not strong. However, some people have their minds set on rising prices. The condition of new cotton is quite good. Today, only Hongzhang Factory took in 100 pieces of Jardine Matheson cotton at a price of $208 delivered to the factory.</p>
<p>Another report on the market price of foreign cotton: The New York cotton market, at the beginning of the morning, first due to purchases by speculators, and later due to the firmness of Wall Street and the purchases of the New Orleans futures market, resulted in a closing price increase of five or six pounds over the previous day. India yesterday, together with forecasts, rose another 3.5 rupees.</p>
<p>The trading of foreign cotton in Shanghai yesterday was again active. Both Chinese and Japanese manufacturers have the intention to purchase, because the factory's inventory is not very abundant, and orders for Indian and American cotton have been placed with foreign firms for a long time. Currently, the war risk rate is extremely high, and there is talk of paying the full amount of the goods immediately after the order is placed. It is difficult to say on what day the goods will arrive at the port in the future. Therefore, factories are searching for holdings in the market, and the market situation has suddenly become active. According to this situation, the spot price will be very active.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Many Obstacles; Cotton Cloth Freight Transportation Is Intermittent</h3>
<p>The cloth market is externally loose and internally tight. The sharp rise in gold has greatly stimulated people's hearts, but the loading of goods on various routes is intermittent, with many obstacles. Inventory is congested, causing people's hearts to become confused again, so the price of goods rises and falls suddenly, presenting a hovering situation. As a result, each piece increased slightly by $0.20. Although the road transportation on this street is open on both routes, the quantity is strictly limited. The Cantonese and Hong Kong guilds and the Nanyang guilds have slightly increased their demand due to exchange rate relations. Yesterday, they handled more than 300 pieces of bleached cloth, coarse cloth, colored cloth, and twill. The Zhejiang guild handled more than 100 pieces of colored cloth and colored twill. The Yantai guild handled more than 100 pieces of coarse cloth, etc. More than 600 pieces of various cloths were traded on this street.</p>
<p>Due to the sluggish sales of East cloth, the mid-range fine cloth continued to fall by about $0.25 per piece. However, due to the frequent rise in gold prices, the trading mood of retail investors was still lively. Therefore, the market for Longtou fine cloth reached a peak of over $32.80, and the closing price was $32.70, an increase of $0.20 compared to the previous day. Sijunzi Serge was at $0.9325 per yard, stable with no gains or losses.</p>
<p>Piece goods exports: 225 pieces were shipped to Weihaiwei on the 31st, 95 pieces were shipped to Yantai, and 170 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Foreign Sugar Continues to Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw a further tightening of foreign exchange rates, so foreign sugar continued to rise. The guild's clearing prices: Grade 4 coarse white, arriving on June 10th, was $77.98, Grade 7 arriving on July 31st, was $78, an increase of $0.50. Transit goods newly arrived were $63 to $63.50, an increase of $0.50. Dutch "Chimei" (a brand) for delivery on September 6th was $64, for delivery on September 27th was $63.30, an increase of $0.50. Taikoo B Grade "Che Bai" (a type of white sugar) was $77, an increase of $1. DY Grade was $73.40 to $73.80, an increase of $0.80. HX Ka was $73.60, also an increase of $0.80.</p>

<h3>The French Concession Authorities Suddenly Implemented Strict Precautions Yesterday, Launching a Full Military Force to Patrol and Search, with Temporary Obstacles Placed on Important Streets</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the French Concession Police Department suddenly took special precautions, causing the atmosphere in the French Concession to become tense. All detectives of the French police were ordered to go out and guard important sections of the roads, closely inspecting pedestrians and vehicles. Patrol teams and armored vehicles also patrolled the roads all day long. The French defense forces were also mobilized yesterday. In addition to assisting the French police in maintaining law and order, they were stationed in the fortresses on the roads, armed with live ammunition, and were on extremely strict alert. Regarding this special precaution, a senior official of the French Concession Police Department said, "We are fully prepared for anyone who disturbs the peace in the French Concession." The official stated that they do not believe that any extraordinary events have occurred or are about to occur in the French Concession. He said that this precaution is merely a customary public matter for the Police Department.</p>
<p>Central and Western Districts Are the Most Strict</p>
<p>Yesterday's precautions in the French Concession were most strict in the central and western districts. Near the Lujiawan Police Station, along Avenue Dubail, Rue du Père Robert, Avenue Dubail, and Route Conty, the situation was visibly tense. A large number of detectives were stationed at the intersection of Rue du Père Robert and Avenue Joffre, and an armored vehicle was parked there. More than a dozen policemen, armed with pistols and submachine guns, were stationed at the intersection of Avenue Dubail, posing as if they were about to shoot. An armored vehicle was stationed at the intersection of Avenue Dubail and Rue Tenant de la Tour. More patrolmen were stationed along the intersections of Avenue Edward VII and Rue Koukuei. Even on roads that were not important within the concession, there were mobile teams patrolling and guarding, closely searching suspicious pedestrians and vehicles. The French defense forces assisted the detectives at all times in maintaining law and order.</p>
<p>Shops and Alleys Are Searched Separately</p>
<p>The barbed wire obstacles that had been moved to the side of the road after the "August 13th" special precautions were moved to the center of most roads in the French Concession yesterday, leaving only two small gaps for pedestrians and vehicles to pass through, and were prepared to be blocked at any time. In order to prevent activities that disrupt law and order, the French Concession police authorities carried out strict searches everywhere yesterday. At 10 am yesterday, detectives were densely distributed along Route Américaine and Rue du Père Robert, searching door-to-door in the alleys and shops, which lasted for a long time. It is understood that no one was arrested.</p>
<h3>Dutch Residents in Shanghai Celebrate the Queen's Birthday: Consul-General Delivers a Speech Praising Anglo-Dutch Cooperation</h3>
<p>According to the English-language North China Daily Mail, Dutch residents in Shanghai commemorated the sixtieth birthday of Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands today (the 31st). Due to the current national crisis, the celebrations were not extravagant. The Dutch Consul-General in Shanghai, Mr. P. Sitsen, delivered a radio address to the British community via the China Press radio station, emphasizing the unwavering unity of the Anglo-Dutch alliance. He stated, in brief: "Allied with Britain and other friendly nations, the people of the Netherlands around the world are celebrating the sixtieth birthday of our Queen Wilhelmina today. I take this opportunity to express the sentiments of the Dutch community in Shanghai. We feel that our Queen, for the sake of democratic ideals, has willingly left the country despite great hardship. The British and Dutch people, cherishing democracy, are strongly united and abhor totalitarianism and its crimes against civilization. Our monarch and royal family have been treated with great kindness in Britain, for which all Dutch people are deeply grateful. Connections, both ideational and material, unite Britain and the Netherlands. We deeply believe that we can eradicate violent oppression. The heartfelt gratitude of the Dutch people towards Britain is the strongest link between our two nations. The Netherlands has previously fought alongside Britain for shared principles, and now we are united again with Britain to fight for democracy, freedom, and the survival of civilization. We are extremely proud of this, and pledge to do our utmost."</p>
<h3>Concern for Chongqing Bombing Victims: Shanghai Residents Donate Funds for Relief, To Be Allocated by the Air Raid Relief Center, and Send Telegrams of Condolences to Victims in Chongqing</h3>
<p>Since Japanese warplanes frequently bombed Chongqing, causing widespread destruction, the homes in bombed areas have been reduced to ruins and residents have been displaced. However, the spirit of the citizens remains resilient and inspiring. Various circles in Shanghai sent telegrams to Chongqing to express their condolences. Now, to actively assist the victims, they are donating funds to be remitted to Chongqing, showing their deep sympathy. The Chongqing Air Raid Relief Joint Office recently received multiple donations from various circles in Shanghai and has already allocated them for relief and post-disaster arrangements. Mr. Xu Shiying, the director of the office, is deeply grateful to the various circles in Shanghai for their generous donations and joint participation in this righteous cause, and has sent telegrams to Shanghai to express his gratitude.</p>
<h3>Customs House Hoists Warning Ball: Hurricane Rapidly Approaching Shanghai; Direction Change Possible, Decision Today</h3>
<p>The direction of the new Pacific typhoon is being closely watched, as reported yesterday. It is now reported that the new hurricane has passed the Ryukyu Islands and is rapidly approaching the South China Sea. According to a report received yesterday by the Customs House from the astronomical observatory, it has reached 25 degrees north latitude and 121 degrees east longitude, with a wind force ranging from 60 to 120 nautical miles. The wind direction is north-northwest and north-west. Observing the astronomical typhoon chart, it has reached the waters off Fuzhou and is now fiercely advancing towards Dachen Island. Shanghai is likely to be hit. Therefore, at 2:40 PM yesterday (Customs House time), the Customs House hoisted a black ball, the hurricane warning signal, on the flagpole atop the clock tower, warning ships in the Huangpu River to take precautions. According to maritime personnel, if the wind direction does not change, there is a risk of reaching Shanghai today. The Taikoo Haijiang and Jardine Matheson Fao Shing, originally scheduled to depart today for Hong Kong, will depend on the wind conditions today to determine if they can depart on time. Additionally, the American President Lines President Pierce, arriving from Hong Kong, and the new Java Mail Line ship Tjitaroem, are expected to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow morning (the 2nd). The two companies made no statement yesterday as to whether this hurricane would affect their arrival dates. A definite time will be known tomorrow morning.</p>
<h3>Japanese Warships Blindly Shell Shipu Again: Investigation into the Bombing of Biejing</h3>
<p>According to reliable shipping sources, on the morning of the 30th of last month, at approximately 7:00 AM, a Japanese warship anchored off the coast of Shipu blindly fired five shells towards the Shipu coastal area. The warship then left southwards, its destination unknown. In addition, regarding the bombing of Biejing by eight Japanese warplanes on August 16th, the following investigation reveals the extent of the damage: Houses damaged or destroyed, include: the Customs House, Wang Guangyuan &amp; Co., Huang Yida Cloth Shop, the Biejing branch of the Local Bank, Yuan Zeng Money Exchange, Yangfu Temple, Ruiping Shipping Bureau, and Yuan Yisheng's house under Fangyan on the south bank of the Yangtze River (hit by three bombs and completely destroyed). A total of over 300 houses were destroyed, and over 20 civilians were killed and 40 or 50 were injured. The bombing locations were all non-military. The long-distance telephone bureau's telephone lines were also destroyed in the bombing, disrupting telephone service. Mr. Tao Wenhan, an employee of the bureau, immediately set out to repair the long-distance telephone lines after the Japanese planes left, and service was quickly restored.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Grain Price Stabilization Donation Drive Ends: Grain Shortage Gradually Easing</h3>
<p>The Ningbo Association in Shanghai's emergency grain price stabilization donation drive for the Ningbo region has concluded, with a total of over 1.35 million yuan raised. The collection of donations pledged by various households is underway. The association will order the shipment of foreign rice to Ningbo once shipping between Shanghai and Ningbo resumes. However, according to reports from Ningbo, the new harvest has entered the market locally and the grain shortage has already eased.</p>
<h3>Shanghai and Hong Kong Prepare for Resumption of Shipping Lines: British and French Begin Negotiations; Xijiang Arrives in Haiphong and Sails for Saigon Within Days; French-Japanese Negotiations Anticipated by Germany and Italy</h3>
<p>Since the temporary suspension of shipping lines between Shanghai and Vietnam was announced, British merchant ships in Shanghai have ceased sailing to Haiphong, instead sailing to Hong Kong and Haikou. However, according to well-informed sources, shipping between Shanghai and Haiphong is expected to resume shortly.</p>
<p>British and French Negotiations: Once shipping between Shanghai and Vietnam is disrupted, not only merchants and passengers are inconvenienced, but the shipping companies also suffer losses. British interests in both Hong Kong and Shanghai are further affected. According to foreigners, British authorities have begun negotiations with the French regarding the resumption of shipping between Hong Kong and Vietnam. Both parties are currently in the process. It is believed that a resolution can be expected in the shortest amount of time. If shipping between Hong Kong and Vietnam resumes, then shipping between Shanghai and Haiphong can naturally proceed unimpeded.</p>
<p>Transfer of the Governor of Vietnam: Shipping industry sources have learned recently that Haiphong is as peaceful as ever, as is French Indochina. People are generally optimistic about the future of Vietnam, believing that it will not be as dire as outsiders expect. The French-Japanese negotiations will surely progress smoothly, as Germany and Italy are well aware of the matter. As for General Decoux, who was newly appointed as the Governor of Vietnam in July, he has always advocated a strong stance in resolving the Vietnam issue, but has now been ordered to transfer to the position of Governor of the Leeward Islands. However, Decoux's transfer does not affect Vietnam's status, as the focus of the French-Japanese negotiations has long shifted to Vichy for discussions.</p>
<p>Mail Still Being Sent: After the temporary suspension of shipping to Haiphong, for mail destined for various southwestern regions via Haiphong, it is confirmed that heavy items have been temporarily suspended, and the post office will forward those suitable, while all registered, express, regular, and ordinary mail will be temporarily sent via Xiamen by the Shanghai Postal Administration. Therefore, although shipping to Haiphong is interrupted, mail service is not affected.</p>
<p>Xijiang Arrives in Haiphong: The French mail ship Xijiang safely arrived in Haiphong on the 30th and has been decided to sail for Saigon within the week. Company authorities stated that if any problems arise in Vietnam, the company will surely receive a telegram from Vietnam, but as of yesterday, no emergency telegrams have been received, so the situation in Vietnam is expected to remain unchanged for the time being.</p>
<h3>Paul Hémery's Injuries Fully Recovered: Has Left the Hospital and Returned Home</h3>
<p>According to the English-language North China Daily Mail, Lieutenant Paul Hémery, Deputy Commissioner of the French Concession Police, was ambushed on the morning of August 17th and shot twice during an exchange of fire with six assailants. He was admitted to the Hopital Sainte Marie for treatment, and his injuries have fully recovered. He was discharged from the hospital this morning (the 30th). Hémery's injuries are said to be quite satisfactory, and he only needs to rest at home for a few days to fully recover. At the same time, the French police are continuing their investigation into this ambush, but it is said that no leads have been found yet. According to an official from the French police, there is no definite reason to believe that the case was politically motivated.</p>
<h3>French Concession Increases Land Tax: Property Owners Dissatisfied; Another Meeting to Discuss Reasons for Opposition</h3>
<p>According to the Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury, an official of the French Concession Council stated that the new land tax, decided by the Council in December 1939, has been implemented. The official stated that landlords throughout the French Concession received a 21-day advance notice regarding this decision, to allow them to consider their responses. Some landlords have already submitted their responses to the Council, while others have expressed dissatisfaction with the French Council's decision to increase the land tax. The French Council does not intend to take any action for the time being. Once all the landlords' responses have been received, the Land Committee will meet again to discuss the reasons for and against this plan.</p>
<h3>Traditional Chinese Medicine Pediatrician Shen Zhongfang Abducted Yesterday: Shen Was Sitting and Treating Patients When Bandits Suddenly Burst In, Brandished Guns, and Forced Him Into a Car and Drove Away</h3>
<p>At approximately 1:20 PM yesterday, a kidnapping occurred at 646 Jing'an Temple Road. The victim was Shen Zhongfang, a practitioner of Traditional Chinese Medicine. He was seized and taken outside, bundled into a waiting car, and driven away rapidly to the west. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>A Renowned and Respected Traditional Chinese Medicine Physician: Shen Zhongfang, a doctor of Traditional Chinese Medicine specializing in internal medicine, is 63 years old and hails from Wujin. He has resided at 15 Mingyu Lane, 646 Jing'an Temple Road, for over ten years and enjoys a modest reputation in the medical community. He sees approximately 40 to 50 patients daily. He has three sons and two daughters, all of whom are young. His eldest son is not yet of age and is still in school. Shen's nephew, Xiaofang, usually assists his uncle in treating patients in the mornings at Shen's residence. Shen himself operates a clinic at 4 Jinfu Lane, at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Datong Road.</p>
<p>Well-Dressed Individuals Arrived One After Another:</p>
<p>Shen has been practicing medicine in Shanghai for over 30 years and has accumulated considerable wealth, making him a target for criminals. At approximately 8:00 AM yesterday, one person arrived to register as a patient, claiming to be named Gao from a certain address on Rue de l'Eglise. Then, at approximately 10:00 AM, two more people arrived, one wearing a gray silk long gown and the other a honey-colored serge long gown. A black rental car was parked at the entrance, with Concession registration number 12157 and Chinese registration number 2556. When the two men walked into the reception room, another man followed, wearing a business suit. All were well-dressed individuals, loitering in the courtyard. Suddenly, they drew handguns, acting as lookouts. The other two then burst into Shen's clinic in the right wing. At that time, there were two outpatients, Shen, wearing a white silk shirt and trousers, was sitting on a chair, quietly taking pulses. His student, Hu Silian, was writing a prescription.</p>
<p>Guns Were Brandished and Shen Was Forced into the Car:</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, the two kidnappers pulled out handguns and shouted loudly. The two patients in the room and Hu Silian remained silent, stunned. They then seized Shen and forced him out, driving him away in the waiting car number 12257. Another bandit, wearing a white shirt and trousers, drove the car at high speed, speeding away. Shen's servant, Zou Yaolin (29 years old, from Danyang), heard the commotion and ran out to chase them. He saw that the bandit car had a white license plate, with the numbers 12157, and its Chinese registration number was 2556. He inquired at number 909 in the alley, and the concierge said that when the car drove out of the alley, he seemed to see one person in the car with his head leaning on another person's shoulder, looking like a patient. The car drove straight west.</p>
<p>Car Numbers Suspected to Be Forged:</p>
<p>Afterward, Shen's residence reported the incident to the Xinza Police Station, who immediately dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to the scene. However, the bandit car had already vanished without a trace. They repeatedly returned to Shen's residence to investigate, hoping to track down the bandits and bring them to justice. It is reported that Shen owns a car, license number 3935. He usually only goes out on calls by introduction from acquaintances. Otherwise, he declines. Therefore, that car is not often used. Reporters learned that the bandit car was a company rental car, but when inquiries were made at various car rental companies, no carjacking had been reported yesterday. Whether the two numbers on the bandit car are forged is currently under investigation by the police.</p>
<h3>Canadian Trade Commissioner Gives Radio Speech: Canada Developing Resources, Intensifying War Effort</h3>
<p>According to the Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury, Mr. Stewart, the Canadian Trade Commissioner, spoke last night (the 30th) on the China Press radio station, stating that Canada is making extensive efforts with the British Empire to help Britain conduct the current war. Mr. Stewart outlined Canada's massive plan to develop its rich resources, which is currently being actively implemented. Industry is also doing its utmost to manufacture goods to support the war. The goal of every man and woman in Canada is to intensify the war effort, and they are currently fully implementing the Imperial Air Training Plan, training pilots and other aircrew. The industrial plan is being actively promoted, and excellent results have been achieved in the manufacture of aircraft, guns, and ammunition.</p>
<h3>No News from Xinan After Sailing to Fuqing</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang-Fujian coastal voyage of foreign ships is being actively tested. The attempt to reach Biejing has been blocked and was unsuccessful. The Xinan ship, which sailed to Fuqing, was expected to arrive at its destination yesterday. However, when inquiring with the Fu Sheng Company, the company has not yet received a telegram. Therefore, the voyage is only to Songmen, causing the Zhejiang-Fujian shipping lines, which have been suspended for a long time, to now join this line to seek business development. However, it is quite inconvenient for travelers and cargo to transfer to the interior from Songmen. Therefore, passenger and freight volumes are not strong. The ships operating on this line are only slightly reducing their losses. The Haiyi ship set sail from Shanghai last night, carrying few passengers and cargo. However, there are rumors that Songmen has been bombed, but it is not known whether this is reliable.</p>

<h3>American Unit of Shanghai Volunteer Corps Takes Over Defense of Northern Central District: Assembled at 4 PM Yesterday and Took Over Defense at 7 PM; In the Future, They Will Rotate with British Members</h3>
<p>After the British defense forces of the Shanghai International Settlement withdrew, the defense of the Central District, left only to the British units of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, was deemed too weak. Therefore, the authorities of the International Settlement decided to summon the American unit of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, Battalion B, to assist in the defense. According to reliable sources obtained by the Pingming News Agency, the headquarters of the Volunteer Corps summoned all members of Battalion B at 12:30 PM yesterday to assemble and await orders. By 4 PM yesterday, they had completed preparations and departed for the Hongkou Western District to complete the takeover procedures. Starting at 7 PM last night, the American Volunteer Corps officially assumed responsibility for the defense of the Hongkou Western District. The British Volunteer Corps, which had been responsible for defense in that area, withdrew at 7 PM last night and were given four days of rest.</p>
<p>British and American Units Take Turns:</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Volunteer Corps temporarily filled the defense in District B, the Municipal Council has successively summoned British unit A, the British armored car unit, and the British light cavalry unit. However, starting yesterday, the American Volunteer Corps, Battalion B, has been summoned to assist in the defense. However, the Portuguese unit of Battalion B was not mobilized. Those summoned included the American unit, the Philippine unit, and the American machine gun unit, a total of over 200 men. Subsequently, every four or five days, the units of the American and British Volunteer Corps will take turns, jointly responsible for the defense of the Hongkou Western District.</p>
<p>Continue Processing Before Agreement:</p>
<p>The defense zone left by the withdrawal of the British army was originally decided by a majority vote at the August 15th meeting of the foreign defense forces, with District B to be taken over by the American army and District C to be taken over by the Japanese army. However, the Japanese side, disregarding the resolution of the defense forces meeting, strongly opposed it, having other intentions, and demanding to reserve the right to make alternative suggestions, causing the resolution to be delayed. The British and American volunteer corps will likely continue to assume the responsibility for the defense of District B for some time before the issue is resolved.</p>
<h3>United States Unanimously Supports Maintaining the Status Quo in the Far East: Prepared to Back with a Firm Policy; More Active Stance After the Election</h3>
<p>According to The Times of London, Mr. Madi, a tycoon in the automobile industry of Shanghai, recently traveled in the United States and returned to Shanghai on Tuesday (the 27th) aboard the President Coolidge. He told reporters from this newspaper yesterday that the United States is currently engaged in a large-scale rearmament movement, and all domestic resources are concentrated on this great plan to manufacture aircraft, engines, warships, and all the tools used in modern warfare. When he left the United States on August 4, this arms expansion movement was actively underway, but had not yet reached its peak. It is expected that this plan will be completed in a few months.</p>
<p>Will Not Hesitate to Fight if Threatened:</p>
<p>Mr. Madi continued, "The general sentiment of the American people is that the United States should maintain its long-established principles of government and its economic and material security in the Western Hemisphere. If this security is threatened, the United States will not hesitate to go to war. Every American citizen, given the current volatile world political situation, feels that the rearmament movement underway in the country is of utmost importance for the survival of the future." Mr. Madi also said that although the United States does not currently have signs of wartime boom, such a situation is not far away. Factories for aircraft, steel, and munitions are working at high speed, and unemployment has greatly improved. At the same time, due to the wide circulation of money, other industries will soon experience a similar impact. Before Mr. Madi left the United States, he heard that the Ford Motor Company had received a contract to manufacture 40,000 aircraft engines for the government, while the Packard Motor Company would manufacture 10,000, with 6,000 custom-made for Britain and the remaining 4,000 made for the United States. Most Americans feel that after the presidential election in November, the government will adopt a more active stance in world politics, and the United States will have a stronger force in all its military preparations at that time.</p>
<p>The United States Pays Close Attention to the Far East Situation:</p>
<p>Regarding the Far East, Mr. Madi stated that the United States has always wanted to maintain the status quo in the Far East and is prepared to back it with a firm policy. As for the war between Britain and Germany, he said that it is not yet known what the opinions of the American people have been in the past few months, as the military situation in Europe has changed repeatedly, and there is a lack of accurate reports on the progress of the war. Since the capitulation of France, Americans who support the Allied powers have expressed extreme pessimism, but in recent weeks, the sense of discouragement has disappeared.</p>
<p>Monitoring Foreign Espionage:</p>
<p>Mr. Madi also stated that although the activities of the Fifth Column in the United States have become a real danger, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has good control over these activities. The FBI maintains close surveillance on the movements of all foreign nationals in the country. Regarding the upcoming presidential election, Mr. Madi said that in recent weeks, Wilkie seems to be gaining ground. A month ago, Roosevelt's advantage was ten to seven, then it fell to seven to five, but when Mr. Madi left the United States for Shanghai, it was already equal. Mr. Madi concluded by saying that 85 percent of American newspapers oppose Roosevelt's third term.</p>
<h3>Foreign Goods Stored in Zhejiang Stores: Deadline to Sell Out; From October 1st, The Trade Commission will Purchase Them</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Government, acting on orders from the Economic Warfare Department, has issued a directive to all stores to sell out all foreign goods by the end of September. From October 1st, it will no longer be permitted to continue selling them (except for pharmaceuticals among essential goods, and machinery and industrial supplies, which will be purchased by the authorities under overall planning). After receiving the order, the Zhejiang Provincial Government has now designated Jinhua, Ningbo, and Yongjia as the first three locations to implement it. All stores should sell out all stored foreign goods by the end of September. Otherwise, they will be purchased by the Trade Commission. If they are found again at that time, they will be confiscated.</p>
<h3>Strange Murder Case Occurs in Hongkou: Cui Guoming Shot Dead</h3>
<p>On the previous day (the 29th), a shooting occurred in Hongkou, taking place on Dong Youheng Road. The Japanese side considers it serious and has been conducting a thorough investigation. At 9:30 PM on the afternoon of that day, seven men wearing short clothes, armed with weapons, rushed into the home of Cui Guoming (35 years old) at 29 Yuqing Lane, Dong Youheng Road, and shot Cui dead. Cui's occupation is currently unknown.</p>
<h3>Today is Journalists' Day: Reporters Solemnly Commemorate, Silent Mourning at Noon for Fallen Colleagues, Strengthen Conviction and Make Efforts in Respective Positions</h3>
<p>Today, September 1st, is Chinese Journalists' Day. News circles throughout the country are engaged in enthusiastic celebrations. However, in Shanghai, due to the limiting environment, there will only be a solemn commemoration, and no ceremonies will be held. All newspapers and news agencies will continue to work as usual to promote the significant tasks during the period of resistance and national reconstruction. All reporters in the city, in addition to strengthening their conviction to promote the heavenly duty of reporters, will also observe three minutes of silence at noon to mourn the journalists who have died in Shanghai over the past three years in upholding the policy of resistance and national reconstruction.</p>
<h3>After Appreciation, Rice Prices Reach Peak Again: Price Limits Treated as Empty Words, Relaxation Unnecessary; Two Concession Authorities to Meet Again to Discuss</h3>
<p>The Rice Exchange tea house market opened at 7:30 AM yesterday as usual. The market situation remained chaotic. Transactions in all foreign rice lots rose to the newly established price limits, and spot goods were scarce. People were nervous. Speculators are not only unwilling to sell off their goods at the newly established price limits but are also absorbing spot goods in the market. Generally, speculators believe that the price assessment committee can raise prices at any time, so the price limits will become empty words, disregarded. It was not necessary to relax the price limits for this food assessment. Some say that production costs have doubled and rice merchants are suffering losses. This is indeed a trick of speculators and should not be taken seriously. The goods bought and sold on the market yesterday were all shipped to Shanghai one month ago, and the abundance of rice stocks is undeniable. Therefore, it is deeply hoped that the committee will give it further consideration, immediately hold another meeting to lower the price limits, and strictly enforce them. This is what four million citizens hope for.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Grain Market Resumes Afternoon Session</p>
<p>The Shanghai Miscellaneous Grain and Oilcake Exchange at 15 Avenue Edward VII had announced the suspension of the afternoon trading session for one month from July. Now that it is autumn and the period has expired, it was decided to resume afternoon trading from September 2nd, and the following announcement was made yesterday: "It is confirmed that the suspension of the afternoon market session of the Guild will end at the end of August. Starting September 2nd, the original state will be restored, and the market meeting time will be (still according to the new hours) from 9:30 AM to 12:00 noon and from 2:00 PM to 4:30 PM every day. This is hereby announced.</p>
<p>Concession Authorities Plan to Convene Meeting</p>
<p>According to Western authoritative sources, representatives of the British and French concessions are currently awaiting a joint meeting with Fu Xiao'an and Randu to seek a permanent solution to the city's rice problem. According to a senior official of the Municipal Council, although the rice situation has not reached alarming levels, he firmly believes that this problem must be solved through cooperation between the British and French concession authorities and the "Municipal Government." Some time ago, the British and French concession authorities and Fu Xiao'an held a meeting to improve the conditions for the transportation of rice from the interior into the concessions. After the completion of a preliminary investigation, the meeting was postponed. At that time, it was found that illegal habits in the rice market, such as speculative profiteering and hoarding, were caused by the lack of inflow from the interior, causing panic. Although it was unanimously agreed to convene a second meeting later, no action has been taken to date.</p>
<p>Rice Stocks Sufficient for Four Months</p>
<p>At the same time, according to the senior official, the Municipal Council's Rice Supply Committee does not intend to convene a special meeting. Although the blockade of Vietnamese ports has cut off Shanghai's connection to the world's largest rice-producing region, the committee still considers the rice reserves here to be quite satisfactory. The official pointed out that, according to reliable reports, the city's rice stocks are sufficient for consumption for the next four months, even if all imports are cut off.</p>
<h3>Public Bus Passenger Assaults Ticket Inspector</h3>
<p>The English "North China Daily News" reports that at 4:30 PM on the 30th, a No. 2 public bus, nearing the terminal at the Sichuan Road bridge, had a group of passengers inside who refused to pay for tickets. They engaged in a verbal dispute with the Chinese ticket inspector, which escalated into physical assault. The ticket inspector sustained serious injuries to his face and hands. Fortunately, Chinese and Indian police arrived in time to rescue him. Five passengers involved in the assault were arrested and may be charged with assault. It is believed that several other passengers also participated in the attack on the ticket seller but managed to escape. A reporter inquired about the case to an employee of the China General Omnibus Company on the morning of the 31st. The response was that the police were still investigating. Apart from the ticket inspector requesting the passengers to pay their fares, there seemed to be no other reason for the incident. The ticket inspector's injuries, after medical treatment, are in a stable condition.</p>
<h3>Heroin Dealer Speaks English</h3>
<p>Wei Lifeng from Jilin, recently assisted a Japanese person in opening a Huishengtang heroin den at No. 160, Lane 1394, Edward Road. After being discovered by the Narcotics Suppression Department, two Korean individuals were arrested and sent to the Japanese consulate for investigation. Unexpectedly, after being released by the Japanese consulate, the two Koreans remained unrepentant and instructed Wei Lifeng to expand their promotion, printing thousands of advertising leaflets to distribute in various neighborhoods to drug addicts. He was arrested by the Chengdu Road Police the night before and 370 packages of varying sizes of heroin were found. He was taken back to the police station for investigation. The defendant, Wei Lifeng, spoke fluent English, claiming to be Portuguese. However, the Portuguese consulate did not recognize Wei as a Portuguese national. Because the defendant refused to admit his real name and origin, the police, yesterday morning, based on the name he provided (Henry Herbert), charged him with drug trafficking in the First Special Court. After a trial in the Second Criminal Court by the presiding judge, Henry Herbert was sentenced to three years of imprisonment for drug trafficking, and the drugs were confiscated.</p>
<h3>Zhang Xiaolin Murder Case: Official Prosecution by Police; Bodyguards Summoned to Testify; Investigation to be Extended</h3>
<p>Shanghai celebrity Zhang Xiaolin was shot and killed by his bodyguard, Lin Huaibu, at 2 PM on the 14th of last month after dismissing him. Simultaneously, Zhang's disciple, Wu Jianchen, was also shot dead by Lin. Afterwards, Lin abandoned his gun and fled, but was apprehended by foreign police and sent to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special Court. After an initial interrogation by Judge Liao, the case was adjourned as the police had not yet filed charges. This was previously reported. Yesterday morning was the date for the continued hearing, and the public gallery was full. French police officers were stationed around the court. The following is a detailed account from the Shanghai Guangshe reporter.</p>
<p>Police Prosecution</p>
<p>First, the police lawyer, Yao Zhao, stated the prosecution's intent, roughly saying that the defendant was Zhang Xiaolin's bodyguard. On the 14th of this month, at 2 PM, the defendant felt unwell and wanted to ask Zhang for leave. He asked Zhang's chauffeur, Wang Wenliang, to convey the message, but Wang refused. The two then argued in the courtyard downstairs. Zhang and his disciple, Wu Jianchen, were talking upstairs and heard the argument. Zhang looked out the window and asked what was happening. Because the defendant's reply was careless, Zhang ordered him to put down his gun and dismissed him. The defendant then reached for his gun and shot Zhang in the face, who fell immediately. The defendant then went upstairs and shot Wu Jianchen twice, who also fell to the ground. Seeing Zhang still moving, he shot him again, killing him on the spot. Wu Jianchen was sent to the hospital, but died from his injuries. The police are now prosecuting the defendant for murder under Article 271, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law.</p>
<p>Detective's Report</p>
<p>Following, the investigating detective, Zhang Dongcheng, reported that since the case occurred, a thorough investigation was conducted. Ten witnesses have been summoned: Wang Wenliang, Zhao Ajin, Zhang Jinlong, Liu Deyuan, Hu Yongkui, Zhang Yongdian, Shen Fuyuan, Bai Zhenping, Yang Ziliang, and Zhang Jinkui, all of whom are Zhang's bodyguards or servants. Except for Wang Wenliang and Zhao Ajin, who were questioned during the previous hearing, the court is requested to question the remaining witnesses in detail. If there is no suspicion of a crime, the police will not prosecute. Otherwise, the court is requested to handle the matter according to law. Then, the criminal Lin Huaibu's statement was heard.</p>
<p>Criminal's Confession</p>
<p>I was introduced to Zhang's house by Wang Wenliang in April of last year to work as a bodyguard at home, not to go out. My father was originally the commander of the 39th Regiment of the Army. After his death, the funeral was helped by various celebrities in Shanghai. Later, I joined the French police as Chinese Constable No. 147, but the salary of only 20 yuan per month was not enough to live on, so I resigned. I worked as a Chinese constable in both the British and French concessions for about 49 years. I treated Wang Wenliang with false humility and addressed him as my godfather, with the intention of having Wang recommend me to the boss. Unexpectedly, Wang not only refused to recommend me but also often made things difficult for me. Although Wang Wenliang was not directly responsible for killing Zhang Xiaolin, he should also bear the responsibility for the murder. If I had not been angered by Wang's arrogance, I would never have committed such a murder. However, when Zhang Xiaolin stopped my business, I was temporarily confused and did not know how many shots I fired at Zhang. Afterwards, I pointed the gun at my own temple, intending to commit suicide, but failed because the bullets were used up. The shooting of Wu Jianchen was also unintentional. I did not know Wu at all. At that time, Wu grabbed me and refused to let go, so I killed him as well.</p>
<p>Witness Testimonies</p>
<p>Finally, Zhang's chauffeur, Wang Wenliang, stated that the defendant came to me in 1935 with a photo of his deceased father, wanting me to introduce him to Boss Zhang. I was incessantly bothered by him, so I introduced him to Boss Zhang, who hired him. Afterwards, the defendant addressed me as his godfather, and I also helped him divide the family property with his stepmother and provided funds for his uncle to open a military band store, from which he greatly profited. I then helped the defendant get married and start a family. Unexpectedly, on the day of the incident, the defendant did not ask for leave from his supervisor but instead wanted me to convey the message, which led to an argument. Later, Zhang Xiaolin heard about it and looked out the window to ask about it. The defendant then became enraged and shot Zhang. I knew the defendant still wanted to hit me, so I slipped away. Afterwards, I heard two more gunshots upstairs. The maid Zhao Ajin said, "I serve the old master. On that day, I saw the boss being shot and falling to the ground, so I went to the back to report to the mistress." The bodyguard Zhang Jinlong stated, (55 years old, from Hangzhou, responsible for escorting the young master to and from school), that the defendant usually behaved well. On that day, I was dozing off in the hall. I knew that the defendant and Wang were arguing, but I only heard gunshots. Liu Deyuan stated, (45 years old, from Hebei), that I caught the murderer. I have been a bodyguard in the Zhang family for 14 years. I was not in the living room when the boss was shot, so I did not know. Later, I heard gunshots and rushed out the door to catch the defendant. Hu Yongkui stated, (36 years old, from Luhe), that he has been a bodyguard for more than three years. He was not present during the shooting and did not know the details. Zhang Yongdian stated (38 years old, from Anhui) that he has been a bodyguard for 14 years. I usually served the old master by writing, and on that day I only heard gunshots, but I did not know the rest. Shen Fuyuan stated, (51 years old, from Hebei), that he was specifically in charge of attending to cars entering and exiting the gate, so he only heard gunshots inside. Bai Zhenping (35 years old, from Hebei) and Zhang Jinkui (48 years old, from Hebei) both stated that their positions were the same as Shen Fuyuan's, and their testimonies were also the same. Yang Ziliang stated, (49 years old, from Anhui), that he has been a bodyguard for eight years. I stopped the defendant and Wang from arguing the first time. Later, I did not know about the argument. When I heard gunshots, I rushed out the door and caught the defendant. The court reviewed the circumstances and ordered that the case be further investigated and adjourned. The defendant was returned to custody, and the witnesses were taken back by the police.</p>
<h3>Wang Duqing Passed Away Yesterday; Funeral Today</h3>
<p>The poet Wang Duqing, a key member of the Creation Society, recently contracted typhoid fever and was hospitalized in the Tongren Hospital branch on Bailinan Road. Friends and relatives were concerned. Unexpectedly, Mr. Wang's condition worsened and he finally passed away yesterday. The funeral will be held today at the Anle Funeral Parlor on Gordon Road.</p>
<h3>Lu Xiaojia Loses Money Speculating; Accuses Bank Comprador of Fraud; Defendant Found Not Guilty</h3>
<p>Lu Junjia, son of former Zhejiang Governor Lu Yongxiang, recently filed a lawsuit in the First Special Court against Liu Yinsheng, a comprador at the Huayi Bank on Jiangxi Road (son of banking tycoon Liu Hui), accusing him of fraud. The court accepted the case, and Judge Fang presided over the trial yesterday. The defendant, Liu Yinsheng, hired lawyers Shan Yuhua and Ling Changyan to defend him. First, the plaintiff's lawyer stated the intention of the private prosecution, saying that the plaintiff, Lu Xiaojia, entrusted the defendant, Liu Yinsheng, to buy and sell pounds with Huaibi in July of last year. The exchange rate reported by the defendant was different from the actual exchange rate, causing the plaintiff to lose more than 18,000 Hong Kong dollars. The defendant's falsely reported exchange rate constituted fraud and requested the court to punish him according to law. Then, lawyer Ling Changyan stated that the defendant, Liu Yinsheng, was entrusted by the plaintiff to buy and sell pounds with Hong Kong dollars. The transfer slips were all signed and acknowledged by the plaintiff. The plaintiff bought futures, not spot goods. Even if the plaintiff lost money, it cannot be blamed on the defendant. The court questioned both parties for a long time and announced the end of the debate, declaring Liu Yinsheng not guilty.</p>

<h3>Overview of London</h3>
<p>London, the world's largest metropolis, is situated on the banks of the River Thames, about sixty miles from the sea. It encompasses "London County," with an area of 116 square miles, and "Greater London," with an area of 693 square miles, and a population of eight million. Before the 19th century, London was merely a city district, with an area of no more than a square mile. Subsequently, the surrounding villages and towns were connected to form "Greater London," which became not only the capital of England but also the world's financial and commercial center. It is divided into several parts: (1) The City, (2) The East End, (3) The West End. The entire area has 1,500 churches of all sizes, over one hundred parks and squares, about two hundred hospitals of all sizes, and countless famous buildings. All national railway lines terminate in London. There are over 700 miles of railway lines within London, including 171 miles of underground railway, with 600 million passengers annually. There are also 5,600 public buses, with 1.9 billion passengers annually, and 356 miles of tram lines, with 900 million passengers annually. The dock area covers 650 hectares, with 28 miles of quays. Annual foreign trade amounts to about 1 billion pounds, accounting for three-quarters of the country's trade. Croydon Airport, located in the western suburbs, was developed during the last World War and was transformed into the world's best airport in 1928.</p>
<h3>Comparison of Military Expenditures of Britain, Germany, and Japan</h3>
<p>— Day and Month</p>
<p>Japan's fourth budget since the war with China totals ¥10,360,000,000,000, which, calculated at the official exchange rate, is approximately $2,830,000,000. The amount is unprecedented in Japanese history. Of this budget, military expenditures account for about 65%, totaling $1,580,000,000, of which $1,000,000,000 is for the China Incident. Japan's total revenue is ¥25,000,000,000, approximately $6,000,000,000, so the above budget accounts for two-fifths of the total revenue. Only 40% of the budget is funded by taxes, with the remainder requiring the issuance of public bonds. It is not surprising that Japan's national debt has doubled since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War. Furthermore, only two-thirds of the recently issued Japanese public bonds have been subscribed, and the amount of Japanese currency in circulation has increased by two and a half times since the summer of 1937. Therefore, although the tax burden on the Japanese people is extremely heavy, the trend of inflation is evident.</p>
<p>The military expenditure of Japan in the war against China, including the specified fourth budget, totals $4,343,000,000, averaging about $1,000,000,000 per year, which can be compared with the expenditure of the current European war.</p>
<p>The London "Economist" magazine published on March 16 this year, contains comparative figures of national wealth and military expenditure of Britain and Germany as follows (in millions of pounds per month):</p>
<p>The above figures are compared with the Japanese budget as follows (in millions of US dollars per year):</p>
<h3>The Rise and Fall of American Film and Music</h3>
<p>— EL</p>
<p>Everyone knows that the United States is the birthplace of film in the world. Mentioning "Hollywood" is almost universally known. Although the film industry in the United States is not as important as national defense industries, its influence is vast and deeply rooted in the people. In the past decade, it has looked down upon everything. However, things in the world always decline after reaching their peak. How can the American film industry, which has reached its zenith, escape this common rule? Therefore, in order to attract customers, second-rate and below theaters do not hesitate to compete fiercely with each other by using "big sales" and "big giveaways". Thus, various promotional methods such as "double features" and "extra gifts, even free meals" emerge one after another. Samuel Goldwyn, the head of MGM, a major film company, recently complained about this issue, believing that if this continues, the future of the American film industry is very pessimistic. So, he wrote an article "Hollywood is Sick" and loudly called for attention to this serious problem so that the film industry, which has already opened the "door of decline," will not really collapse. This is the current state of American cinema. Secondly, the trend of American music is inversely proportional to that of film. It is growing quietly and showing great improvement. Dr. Hanson, the director of the Eastman School of Music at the University of Rochester in New York, recently praised at the National Education Conference that the United States has become "the most developed country in the world for music."</p>
<p>Currently, there are approximately 17,500 movie theaters in the United States. Approximately 60% to 65% of them show two features at each showing, but these are all second-rate or below theaters. First-run theaters only show one feature at each showing, accounting for approximately 35% to 40% of the total. In terms of moviegoers in the United States, at least half of them go to these first-run theaters. This half of the movie audience accounts for three-quarters of the total box office revenue. In this case, first-run customers are the "bread and butter" of film companies. Therefore, Paramount's vice president, Freeman, once said that it is a miscalculation for film companies to hand over their productions to second-rate and below theaters for screenings. Most of the profits of the film come from first-run theaters. A good film always runs for several terms. Later, when the film is sent to second-run or third-run theaters, two features are shown at each showing, and the films are changed every day. He really felt sentimental about it.</p>
<p>In recent years, statistics show that the box office revenue of films has been declining. In 1930, American cinemas sold an average of 80 million tickets per week. In 1940, no matter how much progress has been made in film production technology, the weekly ticket sales are still less than 65 million. From this point of view, isn't the film industry already "seriously ill"?</p>
<p>According to Dr. Gallup, a survey was conducted by voting to test the public's attitude towards one feature versus two features at each showing. Although the final results have not yet been announced, he estimates with reliable prediction that approximately three out of four people do not approve of two features at each showing, compared to one who approves. Among them, the middle and upper classes, whose weekly income is around $25, are particularly opposed to the two-feature system. These people are the patrons of 80-cent, 50-cent, and 40-cent movie theaters. 40-cent patrons disapprove of the two-feature system the most, but the money they contribute to the film industry is the most considerable. In terms of the number of tickets, of course, the number of tickets sold by second-rate and below theaters is larger than that of first-rate theaters, but the profits obtained by the film industry from the sale of "40-cent tickets" are actually greater than those from two 15-cent tickets, so the opinions of 40-cent patrons cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>Under the prevalence of the two-feature system, Hollywood production companies have no choice but to resort to shoddy workmanship in order to meet the needs of all parties. Currently, the annual production of features is 600. Even if all the best playwrights in the world are invited to Hollywood, I am afraid they will not be able to create 600 good scripts. And even in these 600 films, it is unlikely that more than 50 can be considered top choices, and the other 150 are just passable. This pessimistic phenomenon is partly due to the lack of good playwrights, but the production companies' pursuit of rapid delivery and the crude and slapdash production of scripts are also partly to blame.</p>
<p>In the past, film production was very meticulous and detailed in every aspect. After the production was completed, it had to go through a preview to see how the audience reacted. If the audience laughed at a serious scene, or if no one laughed at an interesting scene, then the film would have to be taken back to the studio to investigate the cause and make repairs. MGM once spent four months modifying and reshooting a film after it was completed before releasing it. This is the difference between an average film and a good film, but now production companies only seek to increase output, so where is this kind of meticulousness?</p>
<p>Secondly, in order to fully develop the plot, an average feature film requires a running time of one hour and twenty minutes, or even two hours. However, movie theaters often openly ask production companies to make the film as short as possible. If the running time is too long, then there is no way to continue showing another feature film and other short films. The audience will inevitably demand it in the second showing. Under this requirement, a film is often cut and cut again. How can the result be good? In fact, as long as the film is good, the audience will never complain about the length of time. Just look at "Gone with the Wind," which made the audience sit for a full four hours!</p>
<p>There is no shortage of movie stars, but with 600 films, there are only about 50 outstanding people. Sometimes, a good role does not match the personality of the character in the play, and the result is very bad. In the past, the average acting life of a first-class star was ten to fifteen years. I only need to mention Fairbanks and Mary Pickford. The lifespan of current stars is only about five years; often the starlight appears and disappears quickly.</p>
<p>Any major film production company divides the country into several distribution regions. In each region, several cities are designated as "major cities." There is one or several first-run theaters in these cities. All new films produced by the company are released in these first-run theaters. Let us now call the theaters that specialize in "first-run" films Class A theaters, and assume that the ticket price is 50 cents. After the new film has been screened in Class A theaters, there is a two-week break before it is sent to Class B theaters for screening, with a ticket price of 35 or 40 cents. Similarly, after Class B theaters have finished screening, after a one-week break, it is sent to Class C theaters for screening, with a ticket price of 25 cents. This break period is called the "cleaning period" and is specially designed to protect the interests of the exhibitors. Because the fresher the film, the higher the ticket price.</p>
<p>However, the hierarchy of movie theaters is not limited to three types: A, B, and C. It gets worse and worse, followed by D, E, and even F. These small movie theaters have to wait a year or a year and a half after a film is released before it is their turn to screen it. At this time, the ticket price and the cleaning period have been reduced to the lowest possible level. In the situation where the ticket price has already been reduced to the limit in the E-grade theater, what attractive methods can the boss of the F-grade theater use to attract audiences? And when the film that E-grade theater is screening tonight is shown in the F-grade theater tomorrow, the ticket price will be reduced by 10 cents: Then, if E-grade theater sells it for 10 cents more, won't people say that it has "no good reason"? Therefore, showing two features at a time has become the same way out for these two theaters. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Dance (2)</h3>
<p>When the Han Dynasty communicated with the Xiongnu, the Hu music spread in China. Instruments such as the zheng, the horn, and the pipa, with their busy, urgent, sorrowful, and unrestrained sounds, changed the proper, upright, peaceful listening. Gradually, with gold drums and silk bamboo, miscellaneous dramas were performed, and dance eventually changed into introductions, and then into acrobatics. However, in the successive ceremonies of the suburban sacrifice to heaven, ancestral temples, and imperial school, ancient musical instruments, lyrics, and dance steps were still used, but the number of instruments and the appearance of the sounds were not entirely the same over time. Apart from these matters, however, the common people could not see it. In the literary temples of various provinces, except for the few prefectures and counties that have recently renovated the rites and music, the rest all have music stands empty and dance steps unsynchronized. In recent years, some ceremonies have been performed, and those who saw them were in an uproar, as if they were about to laugh. This shows how deeply ingrained the customs are, and how difficult it is to restore the ancient ways. Dance includes civil virtue dances with feathers and flutes, and military prowess dances with shields and axes. Now the civil dance has been transformed into introductions in dramas, and the military dance has been transformed into acrobatics and fighting stunts, and the people are happy to watch them. The changes of things have reached this point, which is truly regrettable! I have occasionally heard Western music. For each word sung, a musical instrument sounds. Their singing and dancing are accompanied by the instruments, which respond with notes and rhythms, much like the dances of civil virtue. As for the musical instruments being different from those in China, the instruments are chosen according to preference and do not necessarily have to be made the same as in China. In general, Western musical instruments have fewer silk and bamboo sounds and more percussive sounds. Although it is different from China, its intention is similar to ancient music and dance.</p>

<h3>The Bravery of Jesus Christ (1)</h3>
<p>In the past, when Jesus was nailed to the cross, many onlookers mocked and ridiculed him, saying, "He saved others, but he cannot save himself." In reality, it was not that Jesus could not save himself, but because he wanted to save others that he did not save himself, willingly enduring the pain of the cross. This was an ultimate expression of Jesus's love for the world. However, from another perspective, it also demonstrates Jesus's bravery. Fear and love are both the original driving forces behind all cultures in human society. People sew clothes because they fear the cold; they build houses because they fear wind and rain; they build ships because they fear drowning; they refrain from doing evil because they fear punishment. Although fear provides considerable assistance to the progress of human culture, it also has its drawbacks, as it easily generates many superstitions that hinder cultural development. Jesus not only had the courage to sacrifice himself on the cross and calmly face death, but he was also courageous in everything he did for others throughout his life. The words "Do not be afraid" were his motto to encourage people. Now, based on the records of Jesus's words and deeds, we present several aspects of Jesus's bravery:</p>
<p>(1) Being Faithful to God and the Truth: "Some of the people of Jerusalem said, 'Isn't this the man they are trying to kill? Look! He is speaking publicly.'" (John 7:26). Even when some people wanted to kill him and he was surrounded by danger, he still disregarded everything and bore witness to God and the truth, urging people to obey the truth, to have a genuine spirit of returning to God, to value practicality, and not to emphasize empty formalities. Even his enemies said that he "teaches the way of God in accordance with the truth. He isn't swayed by others." (Matthew 22:16).</p>
<p>(2) Not Afraid to Expose the Hypocrisy of People at the Time: Ordinary people always like to discuss the strengths and weaknesses of others behind their backs, saying who is virtuous and who is not. But when they meet face-to-face, they try their best to flatter and please them in every way. Jesus was not like this. His attitude towards people was consistent both inwardly and outwardly, with his heart and mouth in agreement. He was not polite to the authorities in politics and religion at the time, pointing out their wrongs and saying that they were whitewashed tombs, beautiful on the outside but full of dead people's bones on the inside. (To be continued in four days). Readers who wish to know the details should send inquiries to the Literary Evangelism Society at 351 Avenue Road, Shanghai, and will receive a detailed reply.</p>
<h3>Observing Things</h3>
<p>— Mu Sheng</p>
<p>Children, isn't the purpose of attending classes and studying at school to seek knowledge? However, the knowledge gained at school is limited. The main thing is to rely on yourselves to find knowledge outside of class.</p>
<p>There are many things that you see every day, but can you understand their structure, organization, origin, cause, and the reasons why they are the way they are? For example, we see cars every day, but can you understand how they are constructed? Who invented them? Why can they move? In the summer, everyone has to get vaccinated, but can you understand what vaccination is? How many types of vaccination are there? Why do we need to get vaccinated? If you cannot answer these questions, you should observe them carefully, and then study them meticulously, and you must find the correct answers. We must observe the things we see around us, no matter how small the problem, such as why dogs stick their tongues out in the summer, and we must ask "why" and find the reason. If you still don't know after observing and researching, you can ask others until you understand.</p>
<p>Children! If you can do what I say, then I can guarantee that the knowledge you gain will definitely be more than the knowledge you gain from books in a semester.</p>
<h3>Employment is Seeking Knowledge</h3>
<p>— Yang Chunlv</p>
<p>Rongguang! Dearest children! Today, your father came to school and talked about how you are unhappy all day long because your father cannot afford to send you to school and plans to send you to be an apprentice. Oh! What should I say to comfort you!</p>
<p>Rongguang! Being able to study is indeed fortunate; but being employed does not cut off the opportunity to seek knowledge. "Employment is seeking knowledge!" You must know that all knowledge is produced in society, and it is definitely not something that can be fully encompassed by the narrow classrooms in schools. The whole of society is a large school, and all kinds of life are living subjects that you can explore as much as you want and experience to your heart's content.</p>
<p>Many great people throughout history, both in China and abroad, have struggled their way out of apprenticeships! You have heard of them: Stephenson, who created the railway in England, Edison, who invented the light bulb in the United States, Wang Yunwu, who invented the Four-Corner Method for Searching Characters in our country, and Yang Jichuan, who created the Huasheng electric fan... They were all apprentices when they were young. Being an apprentice will never limit a person's development. As long as you can work hard and make progress, success will beckon you.</p>
<p>Rongguang! You don't have to be so unhappy. From today onwards, you should cheer up and plan how to work hard in the infinitely large society! I also hope that every child who drops out of school to work will embark on the path to success in this way!</p>
<h3>Paratroopers</h3>
<p>— Jin Jian</p>
<p>The war in Europe has been going on for almost a year, and in recent weeks, the Anglo-German air war has been very fierce. All kinds of novel weapons are being tested for their power. To what extent have they reached? Flame-throwing planes, silent bombs... are all the crystallization of scientists' efforts, but they are being used by the god of war to slaughter people. This tragic scene of people killing people is being staged all over the earth.</p>
<p>One day, probably in the middle of last month, Ah Hui inadvertently saw this news in the newspaper: "The guard in a town in central England discovered a gray object in the air and immediately warned that German paratroopers had landed in central England, so they searched extensively, but did not find any trace of paratroopers... paratroopers." Paratroopers were another new name, and of course Ah Hui was baffled in his simple mind. So it sparked a conversation between him and Ah Ming.</p>
<p>"Brother, what exactly are paratroopers?"</p>
<p>"Paratroopers are indeed a very new name. This tactic was not used in the First World War in Europe. The first to invent this novel tactic was indeed Soviet Russia. Every time they held a Red Army parade or an air show, there were often paratrooper landing performances. A large plane is full of fully armed soldiers, flying down from the high sky, and umbrellas are flying in the air. Just imagine how wonderful this picture is, but this is just a performance. This time Germany also wants to use this tactic, hoping to land in England. According to reports, German parachutes were found in England, but no paratroopers were found, but Germany does have the possibility of using paratroopers. If the warring countries use paratrooper attacks, the battlefield will be expanded many times over, and there will be no distinction between front and rear, and it will be even more difficult for the defending side. For example, the French Maginot Line, the equipment is so perfect, the construction is so solid, truly a copper wall and iron wall, and the enemy cannot cross the line. If the other side uses paratroopers to attack the rear of the defense line, then no matter how solid the defense line is, it will lose its effectiveness. It is said that paratrooper training is much more difficult than ordinary soldiers, because paratroopers must have the knowledge of both the army and the air force, and they must also have the courage to take risks and not be afraid of death. Think about it, the soldiers of one country enter the interior of the enemy country with weapons, and they must also be familiar with all the terrain of the enemy country. This is a very difficult thing, so paratroopers are just a kind of spy. If they really attack the rear, it is impossible. However, paratroopers are ultimately a special product of the Second World War in Europe. There is an old saying in our country, 'Flying generals descend from the sky,' which has only been proven to be true in modern times.</p>
<h3>Only Children Laughed When They Heard It</h3>
<p>— Xian Fang</p>
<p>I don't know how many years ago, in I don't know which mountain, a lion fell asleep. A wolf quietly came over and gently tied it up with a rope. It was sleeping soundly and didn't notice anything. Later, because it was tied too tightly, it woke up and resisted. Although it suffered a lot because it was tied up, it was exhausted and almost breathless.</p>
<p>At that time, not far away, a tiger and a leopard suddenly fought fiercely. The leopard beckoned to the wolf, asking it to help kill the tiger. The wolf couldn't bear to part with the tiger's fat meat, but it couldn't get away from the lion's plight; so it said to the tiger, "If you don't want me to help the leopard, help me tie up the lion." The tiger nodded and tied the lion tightly.</p>
<p>The wolf was satisfied, not afraid of the lion's revenge, and happily joined the leopard in attacking the tiger, hoping to kill the tiger and share a piece of fat meat.</p>
<p>The lion, tied tightly, was angry. It used all its strength, activated every vein and every cell, struggling, trying to struggle, breaking free from its bonds, and regaining its freedom. With a roar, it swallowed the wolf and killed the tiger... The children clapped their hands and laughed when they heard this.</p>
<h3>A Letter Discussing Writing (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— He Ren</p>
<p>(3) Don't let go of opportunities to practice. There are many opportunities to write in your daily life, don't let them go easily. For example, every night, Mom has to keep the petty cash account, you should snatch it to write. If there is a vacant house for rent at home, don't let Dad write the rental notice. As for at school, there are even more opportunities to write. Copying compositions, taking notes, practicing math problems, all are good opportunities to practice, don't scribble carelessly.</p>
<p>(4) Practice writing misspelled words and poorly written words more often. Pay attention to the words that you often misspell or that don't look good, take them out, and record them in a small notebook. Then use waste materials, such as old textbooks, old newspapers, etc., to find the words you recorded, cut out the well-written ones, paste them in another notebook, and often copy them.</p>
<p>(5) Practice writing small and medium-sized characters more often. The most common application of writing in society is accounting and writing letters. Accounting ledgers for accounting and letter paper for writing letters each have straight line grids. Although the width of the grids is not uniform, it is always around three or four points, which can be used as the standard for small characters. Similarly, medium-sized characters can use the characters on ordinary envelopes and the covers of account books as a standard, from seven or eight points to one inch square. Since we should pay attention to practicality when we first start writing, we should naturally practice small and medium-sized characters more often.</p>
<p>(6) Pencil and fountain pen writing should also be practiced. Nowadays, the application of pencil and fountain pen writing in society is becoming more and more common every day. For example, most of the invoices issued in stores are written in pencil, and most of the new-style accounts are kept in fountain pen. Once you enter middle school, you will mostly use pencil and fountain pen for taking study notes and doing homework exercises. Since the application of pencils and fountain pens is so widespread, you should naturally spend some time practicing pencil and fountain pen writing.</p>
<p>(7) It is best to practice with friends and often have writing competitions. You can invite nearby children to form a writing competition club. Be sure to write a piece of writing every day, and compete once a week to see whose writing is better and who is progressing faster. This can arouse the spirit of competition, increase interest, and progress will naturally be faster. "A thousand days makes a good calligrapher" This does not mean that if you practice writing for only a thousand days, you will definitely write well, but it just means that as long as you have perseverance and continue to practice every day, your writing will never be bad. Work hard! Dear brothers and sisters. Zhige. 29, 8, 23,</p>

<h3>Mrs. Roosevelt Stars in Charity Film</h3>
<p>— Hua Zhi</p>
<p>A "Guanyin" in Feng Shui</p>
<p>The family of US President Roosevelt is full of artistic atmosphere, and the children are all talented. Since Roosevelt's eldest son, James, gave up his insurance business a few years ago and engaged in the film business, the whole family's interest in silver screen art has greatly increased.</p>
<p>The President's wife, Eleanor, is usually a model for women, excelling in writing and speaking, generous and righteous, and highly respected. She regards the film business as a good educational tool and actively promotes it. Although she has appeared on the silver screen in some newsreels, she has not had the opportunity to formally star in a film.</p>
<p>Until recently, Mrs. Roosevelt, in order to promote charitable causes, at the request of her eldest son, actually agreed to star in a charity film for Fox Company, which is undoubtedly an amazing piece of news. With the status of the First Lady of a country, personally dedicating herself to the silver screen, the former Queen of Albania had this idea after fleeing to the United States, but it was not realized due to incompatible conditions, and Mrs. Roosevelt took the lead.</p>
<p>The film starring Mrs. Roosevelt is called "The Joy of Doing Good," and its subject matter takes the social life of upper-class American women as the warp and philanthropy as the weft. It has the style of the Chinese domestic film "Guanyin." This film is planned to be performed publicly in places raising charitable funds to increase fundraising efficiency.</p>
<p>Of course, Mrs. Roosevelt's starring role is completely voluntary and will not receive any remuneration. Moreover, her usual income from various writings and broadcasts is already very high. Also, when child star Shirley Temple visited Washington two years ago, she paid homage to the President and Mrs. Roosevelt at the White House. Mrs. Roosevelt liked her very much and hoped that she would make more films that could transform human nature in the future. Recently, there has been talk of Shirley retiring, and some people have therefore spread the rumor that she wants to make a charity film as her swan song.</p>
<h3>Carlton's Postponed Opening</h3>
<p>— Ling Bai</p>
<p>Wang Xichun and Zhou Xinfang Fall Ill One After Another</p>
<p>Carlton announced a summer break a month and a half ago because it was not cost-effective to open air conditioning, but the lineup of the Yifeng Society was being adjusted invisibly. For example, Jin Suwen, Yu Zongying, Liu Wenkui, Zhang Huicong, etc., have all joined the Gongwutai and Tianchan Stage respectively. At the same time, Zhou Xinfang also used a calm mind to invite Jiang Yunxia, Wang Jingyan, Gai Hequn, Wang Yingwu, etc. Among them, Wang Xichun's re-joining the collaboration should be the most gratifying to the audience.</p>
<p>Originally, Carlton was scheduled to open on the 27th of last month. However, because Wang Xichun was busy with film work, she fell ill and had to let her rest for a few days, so the opening was postponed to the 2nd of this month, and it has been planned to perform old dramas for a month first, and then arrange "Six Chapters of Wen Suchen." Unexpectedly, just when everything was being actively planned, Zhou Xinfang also fell ill. Reviewing the reason for his illness this time, it turned out that he had a part in the three-day charity performance of the Lingjie United Association Baochan Association. He did not feel tired in the first two days. On the third day, he performed the entire "Lu Junyi and Shi Wengong" in the day show for a full six hours. In the evening, he performed the heavy "Battle of Changsha." At that time, he was already incapable of doing so on stage, but he was very competitive and persisted, resulting in excessive fatigue and falling ill.</p>
<p>Now, his illness has not lessened, and his temperature is always between 101 and 102 degrees every day, so he may not be able to fully recover in a short period of time. Of course, the opening date of Carlton will also have to be postponed.</p>
<p>Newcomers in the Art World</p>
<h3>Miss Chen Weilian</h3>
<p>— Tao</p>
<p>In the past, the emergence of amateur theater companies was also a trend for a while. Although some of them passed away silently, there were also some who were working hard in obscurity; the Jing'e Theater Company was one of them.</p>
<p>The Jing'e Theater Company not only has several members who are willing to take responsibility for the theater world and are always united, but also the members are very excellent and orderly. Miss Chen Weilian, who is introduced here, is one of the most progressive actors in the company. She just graduated from Xishi this semester. Her fluent and beautiful Mandarin and clear voice have already made her a versatile person. In addition to having the figure that is suitable for the stage and rich stage experience, she also has a firm and flexible means and an amiable communication, helping the group to move forward. Of course, everyone who has been close to her has kept a wonderful memory!</p>
<p>This time, the Jing'e Theater Company has decided to perform the three-act play "Living Separation and Death" at the Ningbo Compatriots Association in mid-September.

<p>Hawthorne Detective Case</p>
<h3>The Homecoming of the Dancing Queen</h3>
<p>— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter 6 Dangerous Experiences</p>
<p>Although the young man lowered his head again, he still didn't answer. However, I could still see a blush on his pale face. He was biting his lip.</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou suddenly answered instead. "I believe his studies may just be a front, just busy playing with dancers, fighting for love, and even committing murder. His studies may not be on his mind at all."</p>
<p>Hawthorne didn't answer, but smiled coldly, glanced at the young man with a scrutinizing gaze, and then looked down at his leather shoes. He sat down on a sofa and casually put his bowler hat on the tea table next to him.</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou also returned to his original seat and tapped his fingers on the edge of the desk. "I have explained everything we have found out about his motives and actions. But he is stiff and unwilling to speak."</p>
<p>Hawthorne put his glasses and false beard in his pocket. He suddenly saw the nickel-plated pistol on the desk, so he stood up, took the gun to look at it, put it back down, and returned to his original seat. He slowly replied, "Unwilling to speak? Then you don't need to be anxious. He will eventually speak."</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou seemed a little disappointed. He seemed to hope that Hawthorne would do the work for him, but he didn't expect Hawthorne to be so understated. Hawthorne took a cigarette case out of his pocket.</p>
<p>He said, "Brother Jinshou, I think the best way is to first give Mr. Yu a chance to reflect. When he feels like he wants to speak, we will talk to him again."</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou didn't answer, but pressed the electric bell button next to the desk. A servant came in response. Ni Jinshou pointed to Yu Gantang with his hand. "Take him out and lock him up!"</p>
<p>The young man wanted to resist, but after a moment's consideration, he suddenly stood up and followed the uniformed servant out. The door of the office closed again as before. (93)</p>
