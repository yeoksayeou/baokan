<h3 id="c9">美蘇在今後之國際 <a href="#c9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>國際愈演變。愈險惡，至堪焦慮，舉世殆有同感焉。</p>
<p>根據國際最近情况，推論國際當前局勢，彼美國與蘇聯，洵有屹立於驚波駭浪而爲之中流砥柱之觀者也。此其對於國際之積極貢獻如何，茲猶無從估計；質言之，二國能吾防止戰禍之延擴，能吾維護局部之女全，循若所爲，究於發揚人類文明。創建和平基礎，其爲功罪如何，俱待方來之客觀事實爲之說明，而非今日所克懸斷。然蘇聯一面停止其對於交戰國左右袒之攻訐；一面示意德國，關切於瑞典之中立；示意英國，啟發英蘇商務談判之門戶；復於德國所斡旋於蘇義二國之間者，示其落落；對日本，且力闢妥協之謠言；凡此意態，雖不足以遽視爲蘇聯今後行動之輪廓，然旣予目前渾沌中之國際以良好而微妙之影響，則在所不可沒。至於美國，關於地中海方面可能之惡化，荷屬東印度羣島可能之危機，旣坦白宣明態度；於彼國內，促使制裁强暴之輿情，趨於成熟，而海軍建設與經濟措施，尤顯示其政策之堅定且具體；若太平洋艦隊之留駐遠東，則其意態之最露骨者；此而謂便得遏制瘋在，自不可信，至少亦使瘋在者側目而視，重行玫慮其所圖謀。由上所述，美蘇二國之如何積極貢獻，雖尙不足稱頌，然在現階段中，固應爲之表彰矣。</p>
<p>所不幸者：國際變熊之發展，類多不合正常理智之尺度，抑且輒與正常理智背道而馳。蓋如歐戰前途，以恢復和牛爲正常；即使暫難恢復利平，則以不復延擴爲正常；即使延擴，亦以軍略上逼切之需要爲正常：顧事實若是乎？當前所謂險惡，非曰馬奇諾與齊格斐兩綫之間，將有壯烈之慘殺，使數十百萬生靈犧牲於砲火也；非曰北海將有主力之決戰，使鉅數艨艟深沉於海底也；非曰倫敦巴黎柏林，以及其他人口稠密之地，工商業薈萃之區，文物昌盛，歷史悠久之城市，將爲對方空軍轟炸而竟毀滅也；乃曰義大利即將參加戰爭，巴爾幹即將遭逢蹂躪也。夫衡之常理，義大利以保留任何行動之自由，而始終旁觀戰局爲最有利，亦最合理：巴爾幹各國自始兢兢自守，惟恐禍患之相尋，彼交戰國既不必以巴爾幹爲決勝之戰塲，斯巴爾幹各國終於克保中立，是公法使然？亦利害使然。顧不聞希臘與羅馬尼亞兩國當局力竭聲嘶之呼籲乎，呼籲何爲而作？又不見美國當局命令巴爾幹方面之美僑從速撒退乎？不見義國報紙之攻擊敎廷機關報乎？不見紐的泰晤士報揭佈義相墨索里尼氏婉却美總統羅斯福氏居間調停之電訉乎？此皆前昨二日間之現象，似已暗示明後數日間之險惡者也。險惡不復可諱，然義國何爲而非戰不可，固非正常理智所得答復矣。</p>
<p>憑正常理智，猶得斷言於義國雖盤馬彎弓，引滿欲發，終於不戰，若竟不然，則墨索里尼氏一對地中海之願求，志在必得；二對法西黨徒之鼓噪，難於告慰；三對希特勒氏曾作何種條件下之諾言，不容反汗，四對本國空軍及空軍在作戰中之功能，有高大之估價；五對英法所受失利於挪威之影響，作惡劣之觀察；此五者，或可視爲義國終於參戰之因素。雖然，憑正常理智以論戰吾，必以國族在戰時與戰後之利害，爲決定戰吾之標準，而上述五因素，未足爲非參戰不可之基調也。倘使戰矣，終局之成敗利鈍，姑措勿論；而其立即可覩之反應，在美國則必擴大其中立法應用之範圍，在蘇聯則必强化其對巴爾幹之政策。抑此猶反應之至小至窄至輕微者耳，就此反應而作可能之引伸，則視義國參戰爲歐戰延擴至無限度之起點，當非過甚之辭。就此起點以論美蘇，則美蘇將不復爲屹立而不動之中流砥柱，且必成爲舉足重輕，決定終局之要角。由美蘇參加終局之決定，則以美蘇能及早成立諒解，携手合作。然後披荊斬棘，刪繁求簡，而以歐局爲世界全局最後最中心之問題，協謀安定；此則最光明，最合理之捷徑也。</p>

<p>空軍大臣賀爾於辯論時聲稱、余所欲言者、專爲上月所有之事件、及英空軍在挪威之工作、德人早巳據有挪威中部與南部各重要機塲、此爲極重要事、在考量此後發生之戰事時、必不可忘却此點、蓋英空軍自始即已處於不利之境、須飛越北海往來數百哩、而敵機則就近有根據地、勞逸之勢逈異也、在挪威爲英戰鬥機覓一立足地乃吾人之工作、余可切實聲明者、吾人開始空戰、未嘗稍有延緩、德軍甫入挪境、我空軍即從事偵察、不數小時、着手對於挪威丹麥與德國機塲作大規模之轟炸、從是日起、不分晝夜不閒陰晴、我空軍四出轟擊、其努力至爲明顯、而其功績亦甚彰著、在此時期、敵機對於我方根據地與軍隊之空襲乃大减少、德空軍所遭之損失較我方大至三倍、此皆有事實爲證、（政府黨歡呼）</p>
<p>以質言英空軍足與敵方相匹、偵察機隊偕第一批軍隊赴安達爾斯納、以尋覓可用爲降落所之平地、後僅覓得相當地點一處、旋即掃除地面積雪而成爲跑道、並安置彈藥與汽油、不足一星期即成可容納飛機之塲、其時由某飛機母艦載去之飛機、從距地一百八十哩之艦上冒雪飛出、是晚七時降落某湖、夜十時巡暹機即出現於天空、但翌日德轟炸機八十架飛來襲擊、歷十五小時而不止、擲下烈性炸彈不知幾何噸、雙方交戰不下三十七次、結果敵機墜落湖中者六架、墜落附近地方者八架、據英機隊長等之估計、敵機被毀者當有三十架之多、</p>
<p>工黨達爾頓問在此氷湖附近有無高射砲乎、賀　答曰不幸無之、高射砲之佈置、因船隻之沉失而致破壞、當時應使我機隊趕速前進乎抑緩發若干日以待高射砲乎成爲問題、吾人統籌全局卒決定派機隊立即應付敵方轟炸機、英機大部份終因德機轟炸致在塲上失其活動力、但未有自空中被擊落者、</p>
<p>空軍根據地之缺乏、乃我空軍作戰不利之主因、吾人固早知此危險、然不能因避危機而不活動、致爲英國輿情所不容、吾人於挪威戰事中、受有兩種敎訓、一爲英方戰鬥機超過德國轟炸機之優勢、一爲英空軍連夜作戰之威力、然質雖較優、而量則不足、今飛機出產之速度日見增高、視前已大佳、想日後定可愈佳、</p>
<p>賀爾答某議員之問、謂依余所知那維克區域、德方未有飛機塲、德空軍非不可擊敗者、惟任何空軍無論其爲德國或他國、唯在未有充分空軍與之對抗時、始爲不可擊敗耳、協約軍於此求有充分之戰鬥機以與德森炸機相抗、凡有戰鬥機之處、吾人輒表示能應付德轟炸機、過去八個月之戰史、已表明英國戰鬥機勝過德國轟炸機之優勢矣、</p>

<p>吾人早應使海陸軍聯絡、而有互相策應之行動、但吾人竟未如是、吾人僅在覔取空軍根據地之機會上作投機之賭博、此番遠征軍之出發、極關重要我國戰略上之地位及在世界中之威望悉繫於此、乃當局布置配備皆不充分、而未有海陸軍之任何聯絡、德方之準備空襲若干隣近地方及波羅的海、政府非不知之、乃其在挪威之行動、竟至若是、故政府之應嚴重譴責、無過於此、</p>
<p>吾人讀我軍壯烈戰史、深以爲榮、而對政府之愚弄我戰士·愈覺其可恥、（反對黨大歡呼）在余之指揮戰事經騐中、余從不視大敗衂爲細事、政府必須抓住事實、以恢復其地位、目前未有惶駭之理由、但有吾人應格外團結之重大理由、（衆歡呼）、其以事實昭吿國人、國人定了解吾人危殆之程度、英法兩大國今在爭自由之奮鬬中聯合爲一、吾人苟不以危局眞相吿知國人、則不能鼓起不列顚全國使之出其全力、</p>
<p>吾人需有眞正行動、但非如吾人所已行之虛飾行動、至於一篇無關重要表示雙方損失之淸賬、實屬無用、（衆歡呼）、以戰略言、吾人目前實處於視前更劣之地位、希特勒之最大勝利、乃渠已使吾人陷於更大危境、遠非一九一四年德富軸所加諸吾人者可比是也、</p>
<p>吾人給予德國之戰略上優點、第一、爲捷克與其歐洲最精軍隊一百萬人之斷送、第二優點爲何物乎、吾人非有法蘇盟約乎、依此盟約、蘇聯應爲捷克後援、果爾則德國將遇一新的陣綫矣、但結果究竟如何乎、今蘇聯船隻方渡越黑海以飛機油供給德國矣、第三優點、即爲羅國、德國在實際上已握羅國於掌握中、縱德國未於一月前得之、、然吾人已以在挪之政策、將羅國送與德國矣、至於西班牙、則余希望余所慮於西班牙者、不致實現、</p>
<p>今吾人旣將斯堪的那維亞半島置於德國手中、吾人徒訾議瑞典、於事無補、吾人有何權以責備之乎、菩人曾尤援助中立國而保護之、但吾人從未派一飛機前往波蘭、即在挪威、吾人行動已屬馬後砲矣、德國之佔據挪威使德方飛機與潛艇距我海岸更近二百哩、吾人對波蘭對挪威對芬蘭皆曾作諾言、吾人之支票、全已成廢紙、（政府黨大呼「無恥」而工黨則大鼓掌）、今有一小國、肯準備根據吾人空洞諾言而與納粹相抗者乎、汝其吿我、然則不把握事實、有何益乎、人人皆小滿於我國之作戰努力、首相所發吾人必須應　目前地位而不視爲人的問題一語、余亦贊同首相籲請國人方面之犧牲、余以爲國人苟有領袖諸公現正竭其全力辦事之信任、則無時不準備犧牲、今余敢莊嚴發言曰、余有一語吿首相、首相可作犧牲表率、蓋最可促成吾人在戰局中之勝利、無過於首相犧牲其職位也云、（工黨大歡呼）</p>

<p>據可靠方面消息、日方竟藉口特區法法院問題、拒絕工部局收回虹口E區警權、工部局總裁費利浦氏、昨日曾否認日方在歸還虹口警權之談判中、曾將「虹口居民民刑案件不得由特區法院受理」列入條件之中、但渠並不否認雙方談判迄今尙無任何結果、</p>

<p>昨日大會係下午五時起、在霞飛路法公董局內舉行、到中法委員十餘人、中國方面委員有萬墨林·趙志游·金芝軒·陸高誼·姚仲拔·等六人、齊致因赴港未能出席、由法公董局督辦J.Brediar出席、就三小組委員會提出報吿、及所擬定之平抑物價具體辦法、取締囤積及過份利得之辦法、加以詳密討論、前後歷兩小時、當經通過議決、於今日將通過各案、送達公共租界物價統制委員會咨洽、並呈請法總領事奧琪核准後、預定於今日下午、正式公佈、付諸實施、至蕢延芳氏所提議設立食糧產銷機關、係向公共租界工部局物價統制委員會提出、故昨日會議中並未提出討論、但悉該會對於此種建議、甚爲重視、</p>
<p>一致行動</p>
<p>大中社記者、昨晤及平凖委員會某委員、記者會叩以進口米煤因外滙關係如何平抑、據稱、此爲今日與會各委員所憚思竭慮以謀解決之一點、本會決計克服一切困難、平抑物價、以舒市民遭遇之困難、某委員並以堅決之語氣表示、決不使平準會成爲空洞機關、平抑物價辦法、成爲具文、因目前之物價及其趨勢、已使一般民衆均不能負担、迫使租界當局、不得不採取切實步驟、以取締操縱居奇、至於詳細辦法、現均已擬定、今晚譯成華文、明日呈送　總領事核准、並黴求公共租界當局同意、大的今日下午即可公佈、查法租界平準食用品委員會過去所採之步驟、除强迫商號揭示日用品物價外、並已公佈日用品平均價目表多决、以示限制物價、並指定中央。寶煦·貝當·霞飛·麥蘭·小東鬥五捕房、受理控吿案件、凡公衆對於日用品之抬價過高、及度量衝上貨質上有所舞弊之事件、均可向以上五處控吿、但聞過去受琛案件不多、而商人之怗惡不悛者、我行我素、昨日第三次大會、遂決定採取進一步之行動、</p>
<p>調整糧價</p>
<p>據平明社記者向有關方面探悉、公共租界工部局食糧委員會、將於今日下午四時開會、對於米糧麵粉之價格調整、及一般貨品之標價問題、均將詳加討論、英商會會長馬歇爾詩士將主持該會、西委惟來·格蘭·洪克·赫登海格、華委李文杰等、及日委杉村、均將出席該會、聞本市特區法院亦已合作取締抬價、最近已有懲洽奸商之案件數起、</p>
<p>不安狀態</p>
<p>大陸報云、頃據觀察家聲稱、上週法幣跌價後、本市食物·房租·衣料·燃料及他種重要物價、莫不高漲白分之十至二十五、致在上海人口中佔絕大多數之工人階級、處境日危、生活維艱、若輩所得、原祗足糊口、目下苟非工資增加、實將</p>
<p>不能維持</p>
<p>生活、故若干工廠、因工人要求增加工資、現已發生工潮、本市物價指數、以一九三六年爲基本指數一〇〇計、迄今食物價格的達四七三、房租的三四九、衣料的二九一、燃料所增最高、的達五四一、雜項的四二七、一般指數平均高遠四五三</p>
<p>上述數字</p>
<p>雖不詳確、但已足見物價騰貴之梗概、又據本埠觀察家稱、現在薪工階級、窘困萬狀、故各方均認爲除非各公司機關商號當局、能的量增加薪金、勢難維持其日常生活、據調查所得、若干大工廠、現正就此一問題、加以硏究、但據一般人士推測、各工廠對工人</p>
<p>所能為者</p>
<p>恐僅酌加若干薪金及米貼而已、按自一九三八年三月以來、華工工資、平均已增加百分之五十左右、但與生活指數、就物價高漲程度作一比較、則尙微乎其微、近來滬上猪隻及鷄鴨之供給亦吿奇缺、原於蘇北已不能供給本埠需要之牛、據悉本月七日、南市市上出售之鷄、僅有三隻、誠爲上海有史以來所未有、</p>

<p>財政情形已趨穩定</p>
<p>又據接近工部局當局方面所知、該局局公債一千六百萬元、於三小時內認購一空、其中一千二萬元係償付銀行透支、餘款作爲流動經費、並在黑滙猛縮之前一星期內、購進英金鎊十萬鎊、故對該局西箱職員之外匯差率、不生影響、而增加市政捐百分之五十一案、亦因納稅年會通過、定自七月起實施、此外更裁减行政經費、而從事解職高級西員甚多、尤其爲改組工務處曾解職高級西員一批、故該局之財政情形、已大見穩定、</p>
<p>大批西員先後解職</p>
<p>至於該局爲謀節省開支、若干高級西籍職員、曾先後退休、並將工務處改組、將其中高級西員中之無　續必要者、先後於上兩月中解職者、共逮九名、計有高級助理工程師巴林敦·高級助理地產測量員法伯勞·馬　工程師威德斐·園地監督克耳·高級工務員託麥斯·助理奈得·煖氣設備工程師史威區夫可基·主任土木工程師華振·高級助理工程師　金斯等、</p>

<p>上海市商會　銀錢業　公會、奉財政部陽軍、力　限制提存之無積、及政府決心維持幣信安定金融後、昨已錄電通吿各業同業公會及各銀行錢莊遵辦、新聲社記者昨向金融市塲探悉、外匯黑市英商匯豐銀行掛牌、英匯不動、美匯縮〇六二五、實際交易行市、因外匯平準基金會已尤維持、同時匯豐銀行對各業正當需要、已尤供給、因此匯率一致趨長、黃金曙市價格已續跌、各國貨幣以及外商股票均下落、米煤紗等物價回跌、惟證券市塲統一公債趨漲、此則金融市塲趨穩之現象、</p>
<p>限制法幣入淪陷區</p>
<p>政府除對滬市黑市外匯、表示限制供給外、（非不供給、乃在杜絕日方套購）並限制中國自由區域之居民、將法幣運入淪陷區、聞浙省海關當局、已接奉政府訓令、凡居民之欲往淪陷區域者、祗准最多携帶法幣五十元、按政府比項措置、早憶規定、其變動　為法幣之數量而已、據悉首决之限制、爲五百元、後改爲二百元、今又三度减縮爲九十元矣、</p>
<p>金融報載波動經過</p>
<p>最近出版之英文金融商業報云、上星期一匯市、因握有四月份期貨者之出籠、頗呈鬆勢、英匯交易、會達四便士十六分之三、匯豐曾照此匯率吸進、但不知其係代平準會、抑或顧客購進耳、至下午收盤之前一小時、以及星期二日、四月份之外匯期貨、均已交割淸楚</p>
<p>賣戶絕跡</p>
<p>適商業上有鉅額外匯之需要、匯率乃趨下游、星期二日晚、平準會方面、乃出而干涉、維持英匯於四便士十八分之一、星期二日、扒風愈熾、因本埠一部份美僑、曾電華盛頓請美政府貸款中國維持通貨、益使</p>
<p>人心浮動</p>
<p>因此舉可使一部份人士、發生平準基金將盡之推測、此項消息對匯市自爲不利、但不能認爲翌日平準會之中止供給外匯、與此項消息相互關聯、平準基金將罄之說、絕無絲毫根據、反之、平準基金、當至少尙有二三百萬鎊之鉅、但吾人不能忘却、</p>
<p>平準基金</p>
<p>並非用爲制止長期之匯兌逆勢、其目的在阻止匯市之劇烈波動、任何匯兌平準金、皆不能維持貿易長久逆差造成緊縮之匯率、上星期本刊曾載香港舉行銀行會議、討論暫時停止平準金之活動、任令法幣尋其自然水準之問題、聞會談結果、認爲維持四便士八分之一之定價、徒耗基金、因之本埠負責平衝匯兌之銀行、上星期三夜間接獲港方電令、停止供給、</p>

<p>所謂第二次歐洲大戰發動以來，已有好幾個月了。我們看到協約國和德國兩方面的情報，對於戰事的進展程度，還能獲得到比較明瞭的印證。可是歐洲　樣的大規模戰事，究竟將怎樣的推進？戰事一天一天遷延下去，對於遠東的前途又將如何？關於這些問題，似乎是値得我們研究的。在沒有加以推測之前，我們當知所謂大規模的決戰，以英法和德國的海空軍來講，一定免避不了海空的惡戰，作爲兩方實力優劣的一種衛量。至於和遠東的關係，就目下來說，外匯伸縮，國際貿易—尤其關於中國的演變，都有不少的關係。記者昨天遇到一位剛從歐洲返滬的西人，他在上海居留已久，並且經營着鉅大的商業。據他表示：最近中國的對外市塲，不因中國的抗戰而受到不良的影響，反而因爲國外市塲需要，和中國人民努力的結果，輸出方面佔着相當的優勢。至於外匯的伸縮，原因當非一端，但是照他個人的觀察，中國政府旣然決心維持，而且抗戰局面正在走向於有利之途時，不致出什麽意外，這是凡有知識的人士，都當承認的，所以這位西人的表示，多數還是非常樂觀呢！</p>
<p>記者又承他以最近歐陵戰事的局面和對於未來海空大戰的觀測相吿，特爲詳紀如次：</p>
<p>西歐戰事發動以來，歐洲大陸處處潛伏着危機，沒有一處不在準備爆炸。一般人都覺得和平苟不能迅速成立，則戰禍必將廣大。過去數月中，不但西歐的比利時荷蘭，即東南歐的羅馬尼亞等諸國，亦無時不在危疑震盪之中，而近東各國，亦有枕席難安之感。最近德國的作戰路綫，不取東南，逕向西北，彷彿有點出人意外。它不將機械化部隊衝入匈牙利或羅馬尼亞，却用實力遠遜英法聯軍的海軍去襲擊北歐的斯坎蒂那維亞半島，在廿四小時中，占領丹麥，在挪威沿海幾個重要海口登陸，這突然的舉動，吾人分析起來，可以有兩個原因：第一，牠的放棄東南廠，那是不願失去蘇義兩國的友誼，第二，牠占據了北歐，可以對英國北部及英屬奧克納　島及設得蘭羣島以直接的威脅。</p>
<p>北歐戰事，迄目前爲止，協約軍曾在挪威迅速登陸，以阻德軍前進，獲有戰果，事實上究因協約軍並未在挪威獲得可供戰鬥機利用之機塲，致使德軍頗能發揮空軍力量，阻止協約軍援軍的前進。德國業已用相當重大的代價，略占優勢，而協約國爲避免一時的受損，作有計劃的暫時從挪境撤退特隆漢區的軍隊，的確也很類出了敏捷靈活的手段。自此之後，英國在北海方面的加緊封鎖，以及在挪境軍事的另謀新的發展，當然是必然的事。過去幾星期北歐的狀態，只是戰事過程中一個波瀾，不能作爲任何論據。英法聯軍方面，今後一定仍利用其優勢的海軍作戰，斯加基拉克及加特格德兩海峽，將爲雙方海空戰的戰塲，今後必不斷發生大規模的海空戰。那麼，我們且看看兩方面的實力，究竟如何？（未完）</p>

<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、終日處於疲境之中、原因滙市續吿硬化、塲內買氣銷沉、雖證券幫等一度拉提、奈額小無勁、頹勢難挽、晨間即慘跌四十元之譜、且未隔片刻、錢兌業銀號競向售出、價遂撳達六千八百八十元、尙賴證券幫以此價上頻頻搜進若干、致曾回起三十元、惟浮戶散多見高價十九懷出籠之心、兼斯時外滙仍長、金號亦塞、致價重落至六千八百四十元、午收爲六千八百六十元、後市初狀依然不振、散戶團賣、而低至六千八百二十元、嗣突傳德軍侵荷、一時滙市轉軟、激動買風、金號散戶等競拖、價遂抬至六千九百四十元高峯、收盤前被若軍多頭散戶、再行了結所抑低、結果六千八百七十九元、較上日續回小八十一元、全天交易時旺時淸、的做開三千餘兩、銀樓飾金終則亦小十元、海關金等仍平、</p>
<p>蛤赤再跌八十一元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初開滙兌報跌、美滙帶緊、旋即回鬆、致未能激動人心、反之喊賣者頗多、開市即被撳低四十元、金號對做二十兩、遜爲六千九百二十元、嗣因某錢兌業與某銀號競相吐出、一時頭寸更形充斥、續吿步跌四十元、銀號出證券幫十兩、爲六千八百八十元、旋乃賣戶轉少、而證券絮及某銀號等見低撈入、遂回升三十元、銀號互做五十兩、爲六千九百十元、第因外滙仍吿鬆平、復起賣風、某銀號重來沽出、勢又向下、再退入六千九百元大關後、再以滙市續吿步硬、金號及散戶亦賣、市勢更疲、金號出銀號十兩、爲六千八百四十元、將近收盤時、浮多賣風已息、遂吿稍回、銀號進金號二十兩、爲六千八百六十元作午收價、午後　時人心帶疲、一開即小二十元、金號出證劵幫二十兩、爲六千八百四十元、嗣有銀號吐出、續見蛤小二十元、錢兌業出證券幫十兩、爲穴千八百二十元、後以銀號見賤搜入、市勢轉穩、不意斯時謠傳德軍侵犯荷蘭、且滙市略帶緊軟、一時買風頓形擴大、金號幫競向吸收、哄起一百二十元、金號互做十兩、爲六千九百四十元、入後買戶漸少、散多乘高獲利吐出、遂吿回下、且滙市轉穩、進者乏人、立退入六千九百元大關、銀號對做三十兩、爲六千八百六十五尤、將近收盤時、金號稍來吸進、重抬起十四元、金號對做二十兩、爲六千八百七十九元作晚收價、結果比上日續跌八十一元、全天一百二十元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤較高數元、收進减低二十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十餘元、均鮮做開、</p>
<p>首飾金改掛七百元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、初時大同行仍懸七百十元、迨至九時半掛小十元、午後二時續降五元、二時四十五分回起五元、結果掛小十元、計大同時改懸七百元、新同行與上價相同、收進减低二十元光景、</p>

<p>證券暗盤、昨日市况緩緩趨堅、因金子回跌、外滙放長、貼水大减、人心因之稍定買戶乃稍感與趣、市上不乏新多頭及補空交易、尤以散戶五千一萬爲踴躍、大都爲投機性質、臨時短期交易、掉換買賣亦相當熱鬧、上午鴻康聯益出丁入丙、久孚松茂乘機收進丁種、樂茂胡鶴記買進、通記頗有供求、市價乎定、午後久豐益昌協大順康先後費出、鼎康聯和永豐同順聯益等先後買進、求過於供、價乃微高二角、結果一致再漲一角半至三角半、成交的七八十萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>

<p>衆業股市開盤、趨勢甚呆、在起初一小時內、交易稀少、直至午前最後一點鐘、人心始略轉佳、成交遂形增加、下午市况較有生氣、收盤潛勢亦穩、會德豐上落最大、除權股自一百十六元起做至一百二十三元、新股權八十四元至八十九元半、收盤價爲一百十九與八十八元、上海銀公司有略帶刺激之一慕演出、開盤價爲三十七元、開後繼長增高、以至登峯造極、見四十一元新高價、收盤三十九元買進、其成交額由上日之七千股銳增至二萬九千股、此乃謠傳其將發一種「甚肥」之股息所造成、國際股亦受蔭庇、價被推進至三十八元開外、較前日升二元許、怡和與鋼業相反的續吿下游、二股較週三同其跌數、</p>
<p>橡皮股不顧世界各地近頃生橡皮之漲勢、續呈軟化、後雖實業股回堅、亦無響應誠屬異數、唯一理由、殆爲較近德荷邊境情勢吃緊、以及荷人對於納粹意向、全無信仰所致、一般神經過敏者、對於未來荷屬東印度地位、又存疑神疑鬼之心、觀於荷屬爪哇各橡皮公司股之所跌較厲、此種推測、信非茫然、如上過廣吿通知所載同股市交易明日（星期五）仍做至午時爲止、午後無市、星期一上午交易照舊、是日在英倫雖爲一普遍銀行假日、此間則不適用、</p>

<p>洋米早市跌風甚厲、現貨高次一致下瀉、開市最疲、比之前午較小一元至二元不等、即比之前晚亦較小元外至五七角不一、暹邏二千八百噸、已由大浦輪抵埠、故二號暹暹與小絞開價均降至四十六元、然以價低引起實銷外、又被投機之搶帽子活動、市價又見上升、午後被金市與國際消息及期貨等影響、買氣更旺、小絞一度漲達四十八元、旋以獲利出籠、收市四十七元半又少受主、二號西貢五月上期有軋現模樣、開價後自四十九元之價逐步上漲、下午到六十元收市、原包小紋亦至五十八元四角、全日現貨成交七千多包、期貨五百多噸、</p>

<h3 id="c99">滬西公社的「苦兒班」 <a href="#c99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>— 余壁</p>
<p>救濟失學兒童　納費十分低廉　採用小先生制　收效頗為宏大</p>
<p>戰後的孤島，因生活艱難，兒童的敎育問題跟着也嚴重起來。一般學校雖有「經濟班」之設立，給家境淸寒有志向學的兒童以求學機會，但實際上「經濟班」也並不「經濟」，書籍，文具均需自理，有許多兒常還是望門興歎！</p>
<p>最近看到滬西公社的「苦兒班」，我覺得他們收費低廉，學生家庭的負擔　不重；施敎的是小先生，無須另聘敎師，因爲介紹如下：</p>
<p>滬西公社的「苦兒班」是靑年會滬西公社主辦的。該班成立於民國廿七年秋，當時因爲滬西公社（勞勃生路大自鳴鐘）附近係工人區域，家境均甚貧苦，失學子弟極多；該社以服務人羣爲出發點，聯台了幾個靑年會的「義務昌」（大都是靑年學生），創立了這個「苦兒班」。</p>
<p>進「苦兒班」的差不多都是極貧苦的兒童。在開學之前，家長　以索塡申請書，並須塡一張家庭槪况表。在這概况表內，對於住處，人口，尤其是家庭經濟情形，須詳細塡明，經社方訪問後，認爲合格的就通知他們准予入學。因爲他們虔誠地想做到「嘉惠平民」這一目標呢。</p>
<p>得到了准許入學的兒童，視經濟情形，繳納八角或五角的學費（一部份是只繳二角或全予豁免的），就可以入學了</p>
<p>「苦兒班」現在有學生一百多，年齡從七歲起至十五六歲止，最多的是十一歲左右的兒童。上課時間是在每天下午，所讀的科同，以國，算，常三科爲主。也有公民訓練，目標很簡單扼要：（一）勤學，（二）有禮貌，（三）整潔。</p>
<p>至於學級編制，他們目下依照學生的年齡，程度，分成叫班，採用複式敎學。從廿八年春起，幷改用「小先生制」，現有小先生八人，都是該社所設工人子弟小學中高年級的優秀兒童。</p>
<p>這些小先生，如有困難問題，也可隨時詢問指導他們的敎師。每星期四，指導敎師與小先生共同開會一次，交換意見。</p>
<p>每星期五，「苦兒班」舉行週會一次，所有節目，也是由小先生們預備和主持的。小先生們還必須向學生作簡單訓話，那時指導敎師也要出席訓勉幾句的。</p>
<p>據主持人某君說：「苦兒班」的學生很勤學，差不多人人都是經常到的。而小先生也比「義務員」好：第一，他們很有恒性，學生也很信賴他們；第二，他們能與指導敎師充分合作，所以收效很大。社方　小先生也啊相當獎勵，例如將小先生變爲半費生或免費生；每學期與小先生聚餐一二次，及率領他們遊覽公園或到各處去參觀。</p>
<p>我覺得滬西公社的「苦兒班」和「小先生制」，應該推行到各處去，使它逐漸發揚光大起來。有心服務社會造福人羣的先生們，正不妨急起直追地試行呢。</p>
<h3 id="c100">希望發財此路不通 <a href="#c100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>— 維思</p>
<p>某處路牌廣吿上曾用這樣一個動人的標題：「生活非常困難，只好希望發財。」</p>
<p>在今日的上海，誰不感到生活的困難。自然，有極少數的人是例外。誰又不希望解除或减輕生活的重壓呢？假使能够發上一筆大洋財，那眞是解除困難的捷徑。</p>
<p>於是買狗票，馬票，人票（回力球）打花會，淮賭塲，爲的什麼？爲的發財，解除生活的困難！</p>
<p>可是，這樣的發財，也誠如那廣吿所說，不過僅僅是「希望」而已。而眞能達到這希望，怕比上靑天容易不到許多吧？所以，一次一次所下的種子，就好像撒在水門汀的地上一樣，是註定了不會生畏以致開花結果的。</p>
<p>可憐的感到生活困難的人們，懷抱了這難以實現的希望，把褲帶束得緊一點，擠出一點油水來，作爲想實現這其實不能希望的代價。一次希望，一决失望；再希望，又失望；這樣繼續下去，終於使那困難的生活，陷到更困難的深淵中。</p>
<p>生活困難，要想發財，也是情理之中的事。但想用上面所說的種種手段以達到目的，徒然是一種自殺的政策。解決生活困難，請走別途，此路不通！</p>

<p>「不以人役，乃役於人。」道是刻在靑年會大厦牆根石碑上的一句格言。我們知道靑年會的宗旨也是在此，實際上靑年會所創辦的事業確是達到了服務人羣的目的，這是使我們非常欽佩的。如靑年會少年部的設立，使一般貧苦的學生得着了益處，解決了許多的切身問題：如給我們洗澡，閱讀，映敎育電影，游泳，各種有益的娛樂，並設立修養班等等。但在這種種恩惠中間，小小的問題又產生了，不是說我們的奢望過大：乃是實際上必須得到合理解決的。所以把我們心中一部份的建議貢獻給靑年會少年部，並希望能得到少年部的採納。</p>
<p>（一）洗澡問題——少年部洗澡在這樣小小的一間屋子裏，四個蓮蓬頭，人又這樣的多，每星期又只有二次。在這種種的情形下，要得到能洗得身體潔淨，這實在是件非常難的事了。所以我們請求少年部能多闢一間洗浴室，或每星期中能多開放一二次，免得時常發生人數過於擁擠的事情了。</p>
<p>（二）修養班方面——修養班對我們是很有益，雖然是要出一點錢，但我們也非常樂意參加。所以盼望少年部能多開幾班如「新聞學班」，「話劇班」，一連記打字班」，「參觀班」等等。</p>
<p>這幾點貢獻，是我們從內　所發出來的，盼望服務人　的靑年會少年部，能盡量的採納。</p>

<p>第廿三回　舊侶新儔文章有價　名區勝地管領得人</p>
<p>今天在座的除了一位蘇　雅太太，已過中年的人，此外都是靑年，都是富於朝氣的人。就是蘇　雅太太，雖是一位　國老太婆了，也很願與中國的靑年爲伍，一樣的有說有笑。席上，林建成　及薜工程師，近來太湖水泥公一。發展如何。薛工程師說：「我們的營業，是與你們的建築事業有聯帶關係的。建　事業發達，對於水泥的需　愈多。近來中國復興事業，非常進展神速，除了建築房屋以外，還有造橋樑，築馬路，各處所有工程，同時並舉。幾乎使我們廠裏的出貨有些來不及，父非添購機器，添造房屋不可了。現在我們又新設了兩個磚瓦廠，一在常州，是專造靑磚的，一在宜興，是專造紅磚的。出品倒也還好，我們要做出　子，價錢也還低廉，建成兄關於建築材料上，請試用捉携爲感。一林建成道：「那是當然！我們對於建築材料，都是用國貨　的貨高價廉的，况且我們是老朋友，知道在你所管理指揮之下的出品，當然是最靠得住的了。就講我們建築用的木料吧，在從兩海有什麽大建築，都是用的外國木料，這可不笑死人。中國境內，到處有廣大的森林，時常在森林裏面，　，以走幾天幾夜的，還缺木料嗎？就是因爲交通不便，運輸不出，那就沒有辦法哪。到了中國復興以後，各處交通，逐漸發達，木材都可以從山林裏運輸出來。而各省的木材公司，也風起雲湧，正是「材木不可勝」，那裏還會有用外國木材呢？』余擔雲便把何家兩位小姐介紹道：『這兩位何家姊姊，她們是紡織學家。她們現在就要在蘇州的自由村，開辦一個規模較大的絲織　物廠，不日就要建築廠屋了。那又要用貴廠課裏不少的水泥磚瓦咧，這兩位主顧，我先給薛——介紹一下。』薜工程師道：　承情承情！倘蒙照顧，當特別效勞。一當時金澹雲薛夫人也特別話得投機，因向何家兩位小姐介紹道：「說到辦廠，我們造位薛太太，也是　廠老手。」薛夫人笑道：『阿呀！我是鬧着玩的，怎麼有辦廠的能力呢？』原來薛夫　是經營一個廠，是一個玩具廠，專門製造兒童玩其之用的。（　七四）</p>

<h3 id="c104">唐·阿曼契談　怎訴敎養孩子 <a href="#c104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>— 莎薇女士</p>
<p>唐·阿曼契（Don　Ameche）現在已是個經騐很豐富的父親了。有一次，他曾經發表了一篇「怎樣去敎導他的孩子們在這個世風日下的世界上」的談話，現在把它的大槪記述在下面：</p>
<p>六年父親經驗，如何處罰敎誨？</p>
<p>在一九三九年的七月二十日，我—唐自稱—又做了第三個孩子的父親，像前兩個一樣，是個男孩子，這使我和唐尼—唐的大兒子—是完全失望了，因爲我們希望能够得着一個女孩子。</p>
<p>現在我已經有了六年做父親的經騐，知道怎樣去富心一個小孩子，使他走入健康之門。同時我也有一個很好的敎訓對於兒童，那是從我母親處得來的；以前母親對我及我的姊妹們，一向是很嚴厲的。在那時，我雖然常要怨恨，可是現在却要感激了，我今日的成功，就是靠那時嚴訓而得來的。</p>
<p>所以現在我對於孩子們也是這樣，如果其中有誰犯了過錯。我們就大家坐在一起，硏究出所犯錯誤的大小，而與以處罰和敎誨。像有一次，我第二個孩子羅尼，因爲忌妒新生的孩子，把他弄傷了；我們就都不去理他，直等他也愛上了他那新生的弟弟。</p>
<p>養成健全人格，適合自已個性。</p>
<p>養大那些孩子是件極有趣的事，當心那些孩子，試試看幫助他們建設他們自己的人格；但那並不是你强把他們養成的，而是要他們自己的優良的品性。所以有些人說：在目今可怕的潮流中，一定要把他們養成他們認爲所須要的品性，那我是認爲錯的，因爲每個孩子，都有他必然的自己的品性。</p>
<p>我覺得我現在是個最幸福的人，我旣有我所愛做的工作，同時還有個美滿的家庭，雖則現在歐洲發生了戰事，但這對我並無關係，而且這種世界正是我所需要的。在這個混亂時代中，我的孩子們將可成爲一個有偉大人格的靑年。</p>
<p>他們現在在Catholic　School唸書，我知道敎會學校是能給他們更好的敎導。同時以後也要他們進敎會大學，除非他們有特別的緣故，不然是一定要進這大學的。</p>
<p>希望孩子，有真實偉大的人格。</p>
<p>有一件事，我的孩子是决不能享受的，那就是我決不用一個傭人去接他們，或者有一部專用的汽車，這樣是會養成他們浪費的習慣</p>
<p>我不希望我的孩子將來是個兵士，我怕戰爭，我恨爲了戰爭所發生的種種惡果。但如果祖國須要他們的時候，我相信他們是會盡責的。不過我要祈求上帝，這種事情不會發生。講到祈禱，我的唐尼和羅尼，他們在很小的時候就養成了祈禱的習慣，因爲唯有祈禱才能得到身心的平安。以後我們也許要再多有幾個孩子，但無論怎樣，終希望他們將來都有個眞實偉大的人格。</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Brave Soldiers of Southern Henan Again Report Victory: The Japanese Army in Tanghe Suffers a Complete Collapse; The Japanese Forces Attacking Northward from Zhongxiang are Also Repelled; Chinese Troops Near Suixian Complete Multiple Encirclement Lines; A Major Battle is Expected on the Henan-Hubei Border <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Luoyang: The battle near Tanghe has lasted for more than two days and nights. By late on the 8th, the battle had come to a conclusion. The invading Japanese army, after being met head-on and flanked by the Chinese forces according to plan, suffered a complete collapse. The total number of dead and wounded is estimated to be over 2,000. Currently, the Chinese are coordinating with troops on the left and right flanks to clear the battlefield and search for remaining Japanese soldiers. Moreover, cavalry units are pursuing the fleeing enemy. After the news of the victory in Tanghe reached Xinye, the military's morale was greatly boosted. The Japanese forces at Xinqiang (south of Xinye), hearing the news, fled eastward. The Chinese are advancing at full speed. (9th dispatch)</p>
<p>Fancheng: More than 3,000 Japanese soldiers who invaded westward from Biyang reached Tanghe on the morning of the 7th. On the night of the 8th, the Chinese troops arrived and engaged in fierce combat, completely defeating the Japanese. Tanghe was thus retaken. In the area north of Shuanggou, southwest of Tanghe, there were over 1,000 Japanese soldiers who were surrounded and attacked by Chinese troops on the 9th, and more than half have already been eliminated. The Chinese troops attacking the rear of the Japanese forces north of the Jingzhong Road advanced to the Xianghua Road on the 9th, made contact with another unit, and began sweeping to the left and right of the Japanese. The Japanese suffered heavy losses. At the same time, Chinese troops on the Hanyi Road also launched attacks. Important strongholds around Suimenkou have been controlled by the Chinese. The Japanese at Yingzao and other places are showing signs of wavering. (9th dispatch)</p>
<p>Fancheng: The Japanese army advancing northwestward from the three directions of central Hubei, northern Hubei, and southern Henan totals over 100,000, accompanied by powerful artillery, cavalry, and tank units, and assisted by a large number of aircraft. Their ambition to encircle our positions, defeat the main force of the Chinese army, and occupy the area between the eastern bank of the Xiang River and the southern section of the Pinghan Road is very obvious. However, as of noon today, the Chinese army has been using part of its forces to block the advance of the Japanese from all directions. In particular, a certain unit guarding Tongbai has been engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese for a long time, remaining steadfast and preventing the Japanese advancing from Nanxin and Nanque from linking up. Starting on the 7th, the Chinese army began encircling and attacking the outer flanks and rear of the Japanese forces. The main forces of the two Japanese routes have been severely damaged and are showing signs of wavering. One unit broke through and fled northward, reaching Tanghe on the 7th, attempting to attack the flank of the Chinese army from the northeast to relieve the siege of the main Japanese force in southern Henan. After being fiercely attacked by a certain unit of the Chinese army, the remaining Japanese soldiers fled southwest, still falling into the Chinese encirclement. At the same time, the main force of the Japanese advancing northward towards the east bank of the Xiang River from Zhongxian Yangzi has been defeated. The Chinese forces then pursued and fiercely annihilated them at Tianjiaji, Xinjie, and Gengjiaji (all on the south side of the Xiangzao Road). The remaining Japanese forces reached the area north and south of the Gun River on the evening of the 8th, and one unit broke through to near Sanhezhen (northeast of Fancheng). This unit was completely annihilated by the Chinese last night and retreated southward. In addition, the Japanese advancing from Suixian towards Zaoyang were blocked by the Chinese army in the area east of Gaocheng, Lishan, Anju, and Qianyi, and were severely damaged near Lishan. The momentum of the Japanese was greatly reduced. Yesterday, the Chinese army voluntarily opened the front line, attracting the Japanese to the Zaoyang area. As of noon today, the main force of the Japanese had just passed Lizhen Town, and the Chinese troops in that area simultaneously completed several lines of encirclement behind the Japanese. The first line connects Xinjie to the west, directly to Xiangyang, and connects to Tongbai, Biyang, and Tanghe to the east. The encirclement is now being tightened from all directions. The greatest victory is unfolding. (9th dispatch)</p>
<p>Fancheng: One unit of the Japanese army advancing towards Tianjiaji (north of Zhongxiang) in central Hubei was intercepted by the Chinese army on the afternoon of the 7th, with over 1,000 Japanese soldiers killed. On the morning of the 8th, the Japanese reinforced with a large number of troops and launched a fierce attack on the Chinese under the cover of machine guns and artillery. After a bloody battle until the evening, the Japanese were still unsuccessful. On the morning of the 9th, another unit of the Chinese army launched a flanking attack on the Japanese from Xinjie (south of Zaoyang), gradually forcing the Japanese to the vicinity of Gengjiaji, where they were surrounded and annihilated, killing more than 860 Japanese soldiers. The remaining Japanese soldiers broke through and fled towards Tuqiaopu. (9th dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanyang: One unit of the Japanese army in southern Henan, invading westward along the Xintong Highway, has been intercepted by the Chinese in successive battles. The Japanese formation is showing signs of disintegration. Since yesterday morning, one unit of the Chinese army on the outer flank has launched a fierce attack on the flank and rear of the Japanese from the Tongbai Mountains, engaging in repeated hand-to-hand combat. By noon, the Japanese forces were showing increasing signs of being unable to hold out and scattered to the northwest. The Chinese army pursued in separate routes. This morning, one unit of over 4,000 troops reached the vicinity of Shahepu and forcibly crossed the Tang River. The Chinese army took advantage of their being half-way across the river and launched a flanking attack from the front and rear, annihilating most of the Japanese force. (9th dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: According to the latest military dispatch from the front lines of northern Hubei, the vanguard of the Japanese army is 20 miles away from Fancheng. It is reported that the Japanese army advancing northward along the east bank of the Hanshui River from Zhongxiang has reached Huanglonggang (transliteration), east of Fancheng and south of the Zao-Fan Highway. The Japanese apparently intend to cut off the highway near Xuankou Town (transliteration), east of Fancheng, and meet with the Japanese army advancing westward along the Zaoyang Highway. Another Japanese army departing from Suixian is reported to have advanced to a certain point southwest of Zaoyang. There is also a third Japanese army advancing along the highway, currently engaged in battle with the Chinese army near Tangxian Town, east of Zaoyang. (9th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Luoyang: Since the Japanese army in southern Henan invaded westward, it has suffered heavy casualties due to interceptions by the Chinese army. A large number of corpses have been transported back to Xinyang, estimated to be over 2,000. (8th dispatch)</p>
<p>Luoyang: The Japanese army in southern Henan harassed Dahetun (east of Tanghe) and was defeated by the Chinese. Later, they harassed westward again, with multiple Japanese aircraft assisting in the battle, but they were again unsuccessful. Currently, the Chinese army is deploying in the Tongbai Mountains. (8th dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Today, a spokesperson for the Chinese military stated that the mechanized Japanese army has been advancing along the Henan-Hubei border towards the strong positions of the Chinese forces. A major battle between the two sides will occur within days. The Japanese army is currently attacking with 150,000 troops, 200 aircraft, and 400 tanks, advancing from the north and south. The northern route is advancing from Changtaiguan and Xinyang, and the southern route is advancing from Zhongxiang and Yangzizhen. Another central route army is attacking along the Xianghua Highway from Suixian. The Japanese armies on the northern and southern routes launched their attacks on May 1st, while the Japanese army on the central route was only able to begin operations on May 4th due to fierce resistance. The Chinese military spokesperson also recalled the same battle in May of last year, saying that the Japanese army suffered a major defeat at that time. Now the Chinese army is fully prepared. The Chinese army had learned of the Japanese plan in April. The Japanese attack is clearly intended to consolidate their position in Hankou and eliminate the Chinese forces operating in the Hankou area. The Japanese army is not only encountering serious resistance on all five routes, but is also finding it extremely difficult to maintain its transportation due to the Chinese army's encirclement strategy.

<h3 id="e9">The United States and the Soviet Union in the Future International Order <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>The more international affairs evolve, the more dangerous and worrying they become, a sentiment shared by almost everyone in the world.</p>
<p>Based on the recent international situation, it can be inferred that the United States and the Soviet Union are indeed standing firm in the midst of turbulent waves, acting as pillars of support. What their positive contributions to the international order will be is still impossible to estimate. In essence, whether these two countries can prevent the spread of war, whether they can maintain local security, and whether their actions will ultimately promote human civilization and create a foundation for peace, the merits and demerits of their actions all await objective facts to be revealed, and cannot be judged today. However, the Soviet Union, on one hand, has stopped its attacks on belligerent countries for their partiality; on the other hand, it has signaled to Germany its concern for Sweden's neutrality; signaled to Britain to open the door to Anglo-Soviet trade negotiations; dismissed Germany's mediation between the Soviet Union and Italy; and strongly refuted rumors of compromise with Japan. Although these attitudes are not enough to be seen as the outline of the Soviet Union's future actions, they have given a positive and subtle influence to the current chaotic international situation, which cannot be ignored. As for the United States, it has frankly declared its attitude regarding the possible deterioration of the situation in the Mediterranean and the possible crisis in the Dutch East Indies; within its own country, it has promoted public opinion for sanctioning violence, which is maturing, and its naval construction and economic measures show the firmness and concreteness of its policy. The stationing of the Pacific Fleet in the Far East is the most blatant manifestation of its intentions. To say that this can contain the madman is not believable, but at least it makes the madman look sideways and reconsider his plans. From the above, although the positive contributions of the United States and the Soviet Union are not yet worthy of praise, they should be recognized at this stage.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the development of international affairs often deviates from the standards of normal reason, and even runs counter to it. For example, the normal course of the European war would be to restore peace; even if it is difficult to restore immediate peace, it would be normal to prevent its further expansion; even if it expands, it would be normal to expand only out of military necessity. But is this the case? The current danger is not that there will be a tragic slaughter between the Maginot Line and the Siegfried Line, sacrificing tens of millions of lives to artillery fire; it is not that there will be a decisive battle between the main forces in the North Sea, sinking huge battleships to the bottom of the sea; it is not that London, Paris, Berlin, and other densely populated, industrialized, culturally prosperous, and historically significant cities will be destroyed by the bombing of the enemy's air force; but that Italy is about to join the war and the Balkans are about to be ravaged. According to common sense, it would be most beneficial and reasonable for Italy to retain freedom of action and remain a bystander throughout the war. The Balkan countries have been carefully guarding themselves from the beginning, fearing the approach of misfortune. Since the belligerent countries do not need the Balkans as a decisive battlefield, the Balkan countries will eventually maintain their neutrality. This is required by public law and dictated by self-interest. But have you not heard the desperate appeals of the Greek and Romanian authorities? What are these appeals for? Have you not seen the US authorities ordering US citizens in the Balkans to withdraw as soon as possible? Have you not seen the Italian newspapers attacking the Vatican's newspaper? Have you not seen the New York Times revealing that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has politely declined US President Roosevelt's offer to mediate? These are all phenomena of the past two days, which seem to be hinting at the dangers of the next few days. Danger can no longer be concealed, but why Italy must go to war is something that normal reason cannot answer.</p>
<p>Based on normal reason, it can still be asserted that although Italy is poised and ready to strike, it will ultimately not go to war. If this is not the case, then Mussolini will insist on achieving his desire for the Mediterranean: first, he is determined to have the Mediterranean; second, it is difficult to appease the clamor of the Fascist Party; third, he has made promises to Hitler under certain conditions that cannot be broken; fourth, he has a high assessment of his own air force and its capabilities in combat; fifth, he has made a negative observation of the impact of the losses suffered by Britain and France in Norway. These five factors may be seen as the reasons why Italy will eventually participate in the war. However, judging war based on normal reason, the interests of the nation during and after the war must be the standard for deciding whether or not to fight. The above five factors are not sufficient to justify non-participation. If war breaks out, let us not discuss the success or failure of the outcome; the immediate and visible reaction will be that the United States will expand the scope of its neutrality laws, and the Soviet Union will strengthen its policy towards the Balkans. These are still the smallest, narrowest, and slightest of reactions. Extrapolating from this reaction, to regard Italy's participation in the war as the starting point for the expansion of the European war to an unlimited extent is not an exaggeration. From this starting point, judging the United States and the Soviet Union, the United States and the Soviet Union will no longer be steadfast pillars, but will become crucial players in determining the outcome. For the United States and the Soviet Union to participate in the decision of the final outcome, it is essential that the United States and the Soviet Union establish an understanding and cooperate as soon as possible. Then, they can overcome obstacles, simplify the complexities, and regard the European situation as the final and most central problem of the world's overall situation, and work together to achieve stability. This is the most光明 and reasonable捷径.</p>

<p>Tokyo: Japanese Navy spokesman Rear Admiral Kanazawa told reporters today that the US Navy Department's decision to station its main fleet in Hawaii is another anti-Japanese demonstration. However, the Japanese Navy is not seriously concerned about this matter and was aware of the US decision in advance. When asked about the Japanese Foreign Minister Arita's remarks regarding the current state of the Dutch East Indies, the spokesman said that the Navy unconditionally supports Arita's remarks and shares the same views. A US reporter asked whether Arita made these remarks because of the previous rumors that the Dutch East Indies would be placed under US protection when the Netherlands was drawn into the war, and whether the US Navy made the above decision because of Arita's remarks. The spokesman said that he does not see any connection between these rumors and Arita's remarks, or between Arita's remarks and the US Navy's decision. It is important to know that the policies set by a country are profound and rigorous, and will never be changed due to rumors. The US-Japan situation is very subtle and complex, so he maintains a reserved and calm attitude towards the politicians of both countries. (9th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>London: The Times Washington dispatch states that people here are convinced that the US battle fleet's stationing in Hawaii is one element of President Roosevelt's announced policy of "doing everything we can" to prevent the spread of war. This particular event is related to the current tension in the Netherlands and other countries, and the determination of the United States, which can be demonstrated in various possible ways, to inform the Japanese government that it will regard a "protective" occupation of the Dutch East Indies as a most serious matter. (9th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>London: London newspapers yesterday competed to publish news of the US Navy Department's decision to keep the US fleet in Hawaiian waters and engage in other tactical exercises, with large headlines. The Star's headline was "US Fleet Remains in the Pacific," and the Evening News' headline was "The US Fleet's Humorous Order," expressing the Londoners' pleasure at this move. (9th Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Washington: The US Navy's stationing of a fleet in Hawaiian waters remains the main topic of discussion among political and diplomatic figures here. It is generally believed that this measure is aimed at Japan and is a public secret to protect the Dutch East Indies. Secretary of State Hull said that the US fleet may return to California within days. (9th Huitong dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo: A spokesman for the Japanese Foreign Ministry said yesterday in response to inquiries that Foreign Minister Arita did not make any specific proposals during his talks with US High Commissioner to the Philippines, Sayre. (9th Huitong dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e11">Zhang Shanzi Travels in the US to Raise Funds for Chinese Refugees <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>New York: Famous Chinese painter Zhang Shanzi is currently traveling in the United States to raise funds to help Chinese refugees. He recently painted two ink paintings on the theme of Jesus and the Ascension of Jesus, each 12 feet long and 5 feet wide, and donated them to Fordham University in New York City to express the gratitude of the Chinese people for the work of American missionaries in China. Dr. Gannon, the president of the university, accepted them. Officials from the Chinese embassy and consulate, representatives of Chinese newspapers, and representatives of the American Catholic Maryknoll Mission were all present at the ceremony. Zhang Shanzi converted to Catholicism three years ago and had never painted on religious themes before. He has raised over $200,000 in the US this time. (8th Havas dispatch)</p>

<p>London: Former British Consul-General in Shanghai, Philip, recently addressed the annual meeting of the British China Relief Fund, describing how various religious groups, from Buddhism to Catholicism, worked together in China to provide disaster relief. Philip praised Sir Marshall's donation to the Shanghai Executive Committee and the support of many merchants, doctors, and missionaries. He said that 5 million yuan was needed for relief expenses between January and June of this year. The generosity of the British people was deeply appreciated by China, and he was confident that the British would continue to provide assistance. The fund's secretary, Thompson, continued by saying that the fund had now reached British pounds 217,000. Since last September, the European war had broken out, but the organization had not only obtained a large amount of supplies but had also received donations exceeding 140,000 pounds.

<h3 id="e13">Netherlands Invites Neutral Journalists to Visit Coastal Defenses, Demonstrating Efficiency of Defensive Works, Military Measures Taken in the West <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>The naval authorities in The Hague, the capital of the Netherlands, recently invited newspaper reporters from neutral countries to visit the coastal defenses of the Netherlands aboard the cruiser "Sumatra," in order to understand the efficiency of the defense works if Dutch neutrality is violated. In addition, the commander of the Dutch "Water Line" area (including major cities in the western Netherlands) issued a notice stating that various military measures have been taken. Anyone driving a car on the highways in this area must exercise extreme caution. The government authorities, in view of the events in Norway, are determined to suppress the activities of "Fifth Columns" (referring to traitors) within the country. All national institutions, newspapers, and important enterprises are heavily guarded by soldiers. Furthermore, the regulations for punishing espionage have also been strengthened. The Ministry of Justice will submit a new bill to the House of Representatives in the near future, arguing that as long as the current tense situation does not ease, the courts may exile political criminals to the colonies, so that rebellious elements will no longer harbor hopes of being released by foreign forces. The government authorities are also concerned that foreign countries may use airplanes and parachutes to assist "Fifth Columns," and have therefore decided to strengthen the defense of all airfields and other places that could serve as aviation bases, as a precautionary measure. According to a government announcement yesterday, the police in the Dutch East Indies are closely monitoring German residents and Nazi organizations in western Java. Two publications of the party have been ordered to cease publication. A member of the East Indies Parliament, Xian Mou, asked the government whether German residents in the territory might follow the example of German residents in Norway and act as internal collaborators. It was answered that the authorities are paying close attention to this issue, but there is no need to declare martial law in the Dutch East Indies. (Havas dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>America is Considering Storing Dutch Tin</p>
<p>Washington - Officials from the U.S. State Department and the Army and Navy Departments are currently considering the possibility of storing tin in the United States. According to this plan, $50 million in debt would be used as collateral for the Netherlands to store 500 tons of tin in the United States. This proposal has not yet reached the stage of a formal offer. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>Washington - Secretary of State Hull recently stated while receiving newspaper reporters that the State Department received an official telegram yesterday stating that the situation in the Netherlands is increasingly tense due to fears of a German attack. American residents in the Netherlands who are unable to leave the country due to the outbreak of war cannot be returned by the government, as the U.S. authorities had already advised American residents to leave due to the threat of war.

<p>New York - The American Shipbuilding Industry Association recently held its annual meeting here. Chairman Smith gave a speech, stating that there will inevitably be a shortage of shipping vessels in various countries after the outbreak of the European war. The United States, in view of this, has already begun a large-scale shipbuilding program to supplement the merchant fleet, taking the lead, which is commendable. At the end of last year, the government ordered ships totaling 506,000 tons, and shipping companies ordered 1,120,000 tons. In addition, a large number of smaller vessels, such as barges and ferries, for use on various rivers and along the coast, are also under construction. According to the plan set by the Federal Maritime Commission, the number of ships to be built totals 141, and the cost was estimated at $366 million at the end of last year. (Havas dispatch, 8th)</p>
<h3 id="e16">Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Approves the Outline of Economic Construction in Sichuan Province, Convening Responsible Personnel in Chengdu to Discuss Results, Determining Policies, Institutions, and Projects to Be Undertaken <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing - Chairman Chiang Kai-shek believes that Sichuan Province has abundant resources and a large population, making it an important base for the war of resistance and national reconstruction. It is imperative to predetermine an outline for the economic construction of Sichuan Province, with the central government, local authorities, social figures, and entrepreneurs working together to accelerate its advancement. He convened responsible personnel in Chengdu for detailed discussions to formulate an outline for the economic construction of Sichuan Province, determining its policies and institutions, and the projects to be undertaken. The outline has been approved by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, and the full text is as follows:</p>
<p>(Outline of Economic Construction in Sichuan Province) Sichuan Province is rich in resources and has long been known as the "Land of Abundance." With the rise of the war of resistance, it has become an important rear base. Meeting the needs of national defense and laying the foundation for the people's livelihood, the construction center cannot be located anywhere else. However, economic construction is complex and multifaceted, so it is necessary to coordinate the entire province and establish sound systems, so that things are not done in vain and results can be expected. The following are the proposed outlines for policies, organizations, construction projects, funding, and other aspects. (A) Policies. Modern economic construction should prioritize the establishment of policies, which should be based on the ultimate goal of construction. The future economic construction of this province should embody the spirit of the Three Principles of the People, increase material production, seek the happiness of all the people, and benefit the people without competing with them for profit. The effects of construction must ensure that the largest number of people receive the highest and most widespread benefits. Based on this goal, the following five policies should be pursued. 1. Socialized Economic Construction. Since the purpose of economic construction is to benefit the people, socialization should be its main policy. In the future, the construction of this province should strive for the widespread distribution of practical benefits, avoiding the emergence of special class capitalism, so that the benefits of the entire province belong to the people of the province, and the clothing, food, housing, and transportation of the 70 million people of Sichuan can gradually reach a state of abundance and affluence. 2. Rationalization. Economic construction should proceed according to rational and planned steps. There are three standards: (1) Construction should be based on the needs of the people's livelihood, avoiding useless acts and not creating conflicts of interest. (2) Construction should adapt to the resources and environment of this province. The province has a vast area and varied conditions, so it is necessary to formulate regional division of labor plans according to local conditions. (3) Construction work should weigh priorities, determine urgency, divide stages, and set phased implementation plans. During the war of resistance, transportation is difficult, and the transportation of raw materials and the procurement of machinery are particularly difficult. The progress of construction must take these facts into account. 3. Scientification. Scientific management is an essential element for the success of economic undertakings. In the future, the construction of this province should be based on this understanding, so that the activities of agriculture, industry, and commerce are all carried out in accordance with modern methods to achieve the highest efficiency. The selection of personnel should be based on specialized training as the standard. Labor and capital in industry and commerce, and landlords and tenants in agriculture, should also coordinate with each other, each doing their best, and applying the latest technologies to achieve the greatest results. 4. Systematization. The management of economic undertakings must have a sound system as its foundation in order to obtain long-term and reliable results. In the future, the production and marketing of this province should gradually establish rational systems in terms of personnel, finance, and operations, in order to adapt flexibly and avoid wasting effort. 5. Organization. The system is the framework of economic undertakings, and organization is its network. With organization, information can be communicated and strength is not dissipated. In the future, the government should guide the formation of various industry groups and trade associations, so that the government's relevant economic laws and plans can be effectively implemented by various groups, and the legitimate interests of producers and professionals can be promoted and protected. (B) Institutions. The construction of Sichuan Province is of great importance. In order to meet the needs, an institution for initiating, coordinating, designing, and deliberating should be established as the hub for promoting work. The Sichuan Provincial Economic Construction Committee is established as the central organization for promoting research, design, and service. As for the construction work itself, it should be handled separately according to its nature. Projects that benefit the people without direct benefits can be handled by the Construction Department of the Provincial Government. For projects that have direct benefits, in order to speed up their promotion, the government and the people should jointly organize the Sichuan Revitalization Corporation as the parent company to promote business. The people can organize subsidiaries to directly promote business at any time according to their needs and abilities. The subsidiaries are supported and supervised by the parent company on the one hand, and operate their own unique businesses on the other hand. As for the funds of the subsidiaries, part of them are initiated and allocated by the parent company, and part of them are raised by the people according to the method of commercial companies. In this way, the people have the opportunity to invest widely and contribute to beneficial production, and the morbid states of speculation, hoarding, and profiteering can be avoided. (C) Construction Projects. A rational economic construction plan relies on overall planning. At present, the progress of economic construction in the province varies. Some have already achieved results, some are in progress, and some are important but have not yet been carried out. Based on the facts and considering the needs, the following eight items are proposed as the mainstays of construction: (1) Land, (2) Agriculture and Forestry, (3) Industry and Mining, (4) Transportation, (5) Trade, (6) Finance, (7) Reclamation, (8) Health. Key points are listed and advanced separately. 1. Land. The ultimate purpose of land administration is to accurately know the area of cultivated land in the province and the ownership of land rights, so that the relationship between landlords and tenants has a precise basis for improvement, and the land tax revenue has accurate statistics for assessment.

<p>London - The House of Commons recently put the government's motion for adjournment to a vote, and it was passed with 281 votes to 200 votes, a difference of only 81 votes. It can be seen that the strength of the opposition has increased. During the voting, some members loudly demanded the resignation of the cabinet. (Havas dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>London - According to Reuters, Chamberlain will remain in office, but the government may be reorganized. (Reuters dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>London - Although the House of Commons passed the cabinet's motion for adjournment with 281 votes to 200 votes, observers generally believe that since the collapse of the MacDonald cabinet in 1931, the national cabinet has always received the support of a very large majority of votes whenever it encountered important debates. This time, it only received a majority of 81 votes, which is rare. In addition to the opposition parties voting against it today, 44 members of the government party also voted against it. Among them, the most important ones are former Secretary of War Lord Belisha, former Secretary of the Navy Duff Cooper, former Secretary of the Colonies Amery, Admiral Sir Keyes, and Lady Astor, Lord Kinhorn Nicholson. In addition, there were 130 people who did not participate in the voting, including 30 who were absent due to illness, some who were serving in the army, navy, and air force, and between 50 and 60 who abstained. Prime Minister Chamberlain is currently studying the debate in the House of Commons today and the results of the voting with his advisors. Political figures say that the fact that the opposition Labor Party members refused to participate in a cabinet headed by Chamberlain has now been confirmed. According to someone from the Conservative Party, the members of this party have always adhered to discipline when voting. Unexpectedly, a large number of members voted against it this time, which shows that the current government has suffered a major setback. Another point is worth noting: For many years, Churchill, as the Secretary of the Navy, has loudly appealed in the opposition, exposing the expansion of German military power, but the government has remained deaf to it. Moreover, because he led a part of the Conservative Party members to oppose three national cabinets, although his past political achievements were brilliant and his reputation was high, he was never invited to participate in these cabinets. At this moment, he is actually responsible for defending the national cabinet in the House of Commons. This situation is very contradictory. (Havas dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>London - The thirty supporters of the government who voted against the government in the House of Commons last night held a meeting in the House of Commons this afternoon, resolving that the next government must be a truly nationally united government. (Reuters dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>London - The House of Commons approved the government's motion to adjourn until May 21. Super-faction member Davis moved an amendment, advocating that the meeting should reconvene on May 14. It is said that yesterday's vote has greatly changed the national situation. The House of Commons may have to deal with the storm, so he opposes adjourning for as long as the 12th. Moreover, the entire government structure must be reorganized, and the issue should be considered as soon as possible. The overall situation is changing daily, and new threats may occur. It is not a good strategy for the House of Commons to adjourn for a long time in this situation. Time is moving every second, and no one knows what dangers will befall the Netherlands, Belgium, or other countries in Southeast Europe. Conservative Party member Busby supported Davis's amendment. National Conservative Party member Loftus opposed the amendment, saying that they all admitted that the entire government must be changed, including people from various parties and even people outside the parties, so it is very appropriate for this meeting to be held on the 10th or 12th, so that the leaders of each party can discuss their opinions every day. Liberal opposition member Mandel said that a long-term adjournment cannot be made now. Conservative Party member Margesson reiterated the Prime Minister's assurance that Congress would be convened before May 21 if necessary. Then Davis withdrew the amendment. Secretary of the Interior Anderson announced that it is now urgently necessary to increase the authority's new regulations on dealing with foreign activities and implementing the suppression of propaganda that obstructs the war by law. Opposition leader Attlee stated that the Secretary of the Interior had decided to consult with members of Congress on the new regulations, but this does not mean that members of Congress agree with or oppose the new regulations. (Reuters dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>London - According to a Reuters House of Commons lounge interviewer, it is quite clear that the Labor Opposition Party and Lloyd George will not accept official positions under the Chamberlain government. The Labor Opposition Party has accepted the motion for a ten-day adjournment of the House of Commons. The Labor Party will hold a meeting next week. In view of the changes in government personnel, the government's motion for parliamentary adjournment is a good opportunity for discussion. The Prime Minister has invited a delegation of pro-supporter members of "1922" to Downing Street to meet. (Reuters dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>London - Foreign Minister Halifax went to the Foreign Office this morning to discuss matters, and then hurried to Downing Street at 10:00 a.m. At 10:55 a.m., he went to the House of Commons. About a hundred citizens gathered in front of his residence, cheering and saluting him. (Havas dispatch, 9th)</p>
<h3 id="e18">British House of Lords Debates Norway War Situation, British Foreign Minister and Minister Without Portfolio Refute Members' Accusations Separately <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>London - When answering questions in the House of Lords, Minister Without Portfolio Lord Hankey first stated that the bravery and competence of the British troops in Norway is a glorious precedent for the nation and a good omen for the future. He then said that some people believe that the government lacked sensitive information on this matter. However, we knew in advance that the enemy had concentrated troops and ships, and was engaged in embarkation and disembarkation exercises. However, given the close relationship between Norway and Denmark and Germany, if we had not heard anything about Germany's actions beforehand, what we knew would certainly not be more than the governments of Norway and Denmark. Regarding the German plan mentioned by Lord Strathbogey, many such books have been published outside. The General Staff knew of the existence of this plan, and we had also drafted a counter-plan to deal with special emergency actions when necessary. I think the government's dispersal of aid to Finnish troops was too thoughtful, because the government believed that it was not appropriate to keep all of these troops stagnant under the circumstances at that time, and to requisition ships needed in other areas as well. (omission)</p>
<p>Hankey also refuted a certain question, first stating that the setbacks in Norway were not enough to prevent the Allies from achieving final victory, and that the Germans had transferred eight or nine divisions of the army and a large number of air force from the central theater to the Norwegian theater, and had suffered extremely heavy casualties. We should not be discouraged by this retreat, but should express our satisfaction with the heroic achievements of our troops.</p>
<p>Lord Chatfield then rose to speak, saying that it is a mistake to say that the retreat from central Norway was an unfortunate event. This matter will not affect the final victory of the Allies. I believe that this retreat was a practical and heroic performance, but it is completely different from the Battle of Gallipoli in the past. The British troops who went to Gallipoli at that time were temporarily transferred from the battlefield. The British troops fighting in Norway today were specially retained after the General Staff's full consideration for the purpose of providing this aid. I firmly believe that the government will launch fierce attacks on the enemy's communication lines day and night in the entire theater of war in the future, and will completely eliminate the few German troops. Norway will definitely be our backing.</p>
<p>Lord Teynham also rose to speak, saying that it is extremely doubtful whether the occupation of Trondheim will give Britain an advantage in the air. This matter may make the situation even more dangerous. Foreign Minister Lord Halifax answered the debate, saying that it is impossible for members of the upper and lower houses to distinguish between the Prime Minister and any other member of the War Cabinet who is in full agreement and shares full responsibility for all matters. I cannot say that the government is without fault, but I do not often express regret on behalf of the government. The Foreign Minister strongly criticized the illusion of a shortcut to victory, saying that I have always been reluctant to mention the great hardships that the country will encounter, or that this war will largely depend on the government's ability to maintain stability and lead all efforts without expending significant energy. Therefore, I hope that the government will not deviate from its main purpose, but will seek the best technical advice and take the most effective approach. Someone asked whether the various supply matters would be under the authority of Churchill. Halifax replied that I believe that Churchill can conduct any investigation into the supply issue and suggest organizational improvements. If there are difficult problems, he can submit them to the cabinet for resolution. As for the two matters of establishing a War Cabinet and recommending a smaller group of ministers without portfolio, the purpose is the same, that is, to seek the efficiency that all matters should have. There is now a real danger that obvious simplification will only add another cog to the machine and cause even greater delays. All members of the government have only one goal, which is to achieve victory. Whenever we believe that others can do a better job, I know that they will be willing to give way to the wise and will never be reluctant to leave, because the responsibility we bear today cannot satisfy people, but is a heavy burden and is sometimes close to unbearable. Anyone who can do their job has no right to fail to recognize the mistakes pointed out to them and should welcome them. Halifax continued, saying that most of the criticism is based on information that is not detailed, and at the same time is based on what is known more than the government knew when it took action. From the government's point of view, it is not enough to care about it, but when the effect of the criticism makes the whole country feel that the combat efforts of those responsible for directing the war are improperly planned and the measures are wrong, then I think this criticism has destroyed its purpose, and only adds unnecessary and useless weight to the unavoidable hardships of the war.</p>
<p>The House of Lords took no action on the vote. Then Lord Snell rose to say that the Labor Party is willing to reaffirm the important responsibilities that the country should bear for the principles on which it started the war in the most powerful way. We have no retreat or disagreement in resisting the threats of tyranny and injustice, the threats of authoritarianism to freedom, and the threats of totalitarianism to democracy, because there are no parties or boundaries to speak of today.

<p>London - The opposition party in the House of Commons severely criticized the government last night because of the Norwegian military setbacks.

<h3 id="e20">Hall's Report: Sky Battles <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>During a debate, Air Minister Hall stated, "What I want to discuss is specifically the events of the past month and the work of the British Air Force in Norway. The Germans had already occupied important airfields in central and southern Norway, which is extremely important. When considering the subsequent battles, this point must not be forgotten. From the beginning, the British Air Force was at a disadvantage, having to fly hundreds of miles across the North Sea, while the enemy planes had nearby bases. The difference in conditions was vast. Finding a base for British fighters in Norway was our task. I can state unequivocally that we began aerial combat without any delay. As soon as German troops entered Norway, our air force began reconnaissance. Within hours, we launched large-scale bombing raids on airfields in Norway, Denmark, and Germany. From that day on, day and night, rain or shine, our air force carried out bombing missions. Their efforts were very evident, and their achievements were also very remarkable. During this period, enemy air raids on our bases and troops were greatly reduced. The German air force suffered losses three times greater than ours. All of this is supported by factual evidence." (Government party cheers)</p>
<p>"In short, the British Air Force is a match for the enemy. Reconnaissance aircraft accompanied the first troops to Åndalsnes to find flat ground suitable for landing. Eventually, only one suitable location was found, and the snow was cleared from the ground to create a runway. Ammunition and gasoline were also set up. In less than a week, it became an airfield capable of accommodating aircraft. At that time, aircraft carried by an aircraft carrier flew out from the ship, 180 miles away, in the snow. They landed on a lake at 7 PM that evening, and reconnaissance planes appeared in the sky at 10 PM. However, the next day, 80 German bombers arrived to attack, continuing for fifteen hours without stopping, dropping countless tons of high-explosive bombs. The two sides engaged in at least thirty-seven battles. As a result, six enemy planes crashed into the lake, and eight crashed in nearby areas. According to estimates by the British air squadron leaders, at least thirty enemy planes were destroyed."</p>
<p>Labour Party's Dalton asked if there were anti-aircraft guns near this frozen lake. Hall replied, "Unfortunately, no. The deployment of anti-aircraft guns was disrupted due to the sinking of ships. At the time, the question was whether to rush our air squadron forward or delay it for a few days to wait for the anti-aircraft guns. After considering the overall situation, we ultimately decided to send the air squadron to deal with the German bombers immediately. Most of the British aircraft were rendered inoperable on the ground due to German bombing, but none were shot down from the air."</p>
<p>"The lack of air bases was the main reason for the British Air Force's disadvantage in the operation. We were aware of this danger early on, but we could not avoid action to avoid the crisis, as it would not be tolerated by British public opinion. We have learned two lessons from the Norwegian campaign: first, the superiority of British fighters over German bombers; and second, the power of the British Air Force to operate at night. However, while the quality is superior, the quantity is insufficient. The speed of aircraft production is increasing day by day, which is much better than before. I think it will definitely get better in the future."</p>
<p>Answering a question from a certain member of parliament, Hall said, "According to what I know, there are no airfields in the Narvik area. The German air force is not invincible. However, any air force, whether German or otherwise, is only invincible when there is no sufficient air force to counter it. The Allies are seeking to have sufficient fighters to counter German bombers here. Wherever there are fighters, we express our ability to deal with German bombers. The war history of the past eight months has shown the superiority of British fighters over German bombers."</p>
<h3 id="e21">Lloyd George Raises Questions <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>Lloyd George began by saying, "The facts stated by Hall are not sufficient to defend the government. The first batch of British soldiers sent to Norway should have been elite troops. The Germans had a strong force, while we responded with untrained Home Guard. It is important to know that the work that the vanguard should accomplish is related to the success or failure of the entire army."</p>
<p>"We should have ensured that the army and navy were in contact and had mutually supportive actions, but we did not do so. We were merely gambling on the opportunity to find air bases. The departure of this expeditionary force was extremely important, as the strategic position of our country and its prestige in the world were at stake. However, the authorities' arrangements and equipment were inadequate, and there was no coordination between the army and navy. The government knew that the Germans were preparing to launch air raids on several neighboring areas and the Baltic Sea. However, their actions in Norway were such that the government should be severely condemned for this."</p>
<p>"We are deeply honored to read the heroic war history of our army, but we feel even more ashamed of the government's deception of our soldiers." (Opposition party cheers loudly) "In my experience of commanding wars, I never regard a major defeat as a trivial matter. The government must grasp the facts to restore its position. There is no reason to panic at the moment, but there is a major reason why we should be more united." (The crowd cheers) "By informing the people of the facts, the people will understand the extent of our danger. The two major powers of Britain and France are now united in the struggle for freedom. If we do not inform the people of the true situation of the crisis, we will not be able to mobilize the entire nation of Britain to exert its full strength."</p>
<p>"We need real action, but not the superficial action that we have already taken. As for a meaningless account of the losses on both sides, it is useless." (The crowd cheers) "In terms of strategy, we are currently in a worse position than before. Hitler's greatest victory is that he has put us in a greater danger, far more than what the German submarines inflicted on us in 1914."</p>
<p>"The strategic advantages we have given to Germany are: first, the loss of Czechoslovakia and its one million best European troops; what is the second advantage? Did we not have a Franco-Soviet alliance? According to this alliance, the Soviet Union should have supported Czechoslovakia. If that were the case, Germany would have encountered a new front. But what was the result in the end? Now Soviet ships are crossing the Black Sea to supply Germany with aviation fuel. The third advantage is Romania. Germany has virtually taken Romania into its grasp. Even if Germany did not get it a month ago, we have sent Romania to Germany with our policy in Norway. As for Spain, I hope that what I am worried about in Spain will not come true."</p>
<p>"Now that we have placed the Scandinavian Peninsula in Germany's hands, it is useless for us to criticize Sweden. What right do we have to blame them? We used to provide aid to neutral countries and protect them, but we never sent an aircraft to Poland. Even in Norway, our actions were an afterthought. Germany's occupation of Norway has brought German planes and submarines 200 miles closer to our coast. We have made promises to Poland, Norway, and Finland. All of our checks have become waste paper." (The government party shouts "Shameless," while the Labour Party applauds loudly) "Now, will any small country be prepared to resist the Nazis based on our empty promises? You tell me. Then what is the point of not grasping the facts? Everyone is dissatisfied with our country's war efforts. I also agree with the Prime Minister's statement that we must respond to the current situation and not regard it as a human problem. I support the Prime Minister's call for sacrifices from the people. I believe that if the people have the trust that the leaders are doing their best, they will always be prepared to sacrifice. Now I dare to solemnly declare that I have a word to tell the Prime Minister: The Prime Minister can set an example of sacrifice, because nothing can contribute more to our victory in the war than the Prime Minister sacrificing his position."

<p>Former First Lord of the Admiralty Cooper then spoke, saying that the public hopes that the government will be fully moved by the opinions they have heard and the information they have received from private sources and take steps to remedy the current difficulties. He does not want to hear the Prime Minister's words of begging for friendship. His resignation from the current cabinet is to express his distrust of the current government. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<h3 id="e23">Alexander Ends Debate <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>Finally, Labour Party's Alexander rose to end the debate, praising the work of the British troops who fought hard in the Nordic peninsula for four weeks, and then said that the reason why we are asking the government to change its plans and organization tonight is because we know that there is dissatisfaction with the government in various parts of the country regarding the British troops in Norway. Within two or three days after the troops returned from Norway, I received reports of inadequate equipment to cope with the battlefield situation and the lack of cannons, anti-aircraft guns, and sometimes even shells. Although the country has not been alarmed by the current serious situation, the people do expect that when the government sends troops to fight abroad for the country and freedom, it should send them in appropriate conditions as far as possible, doing its best to ensure that everything is in order, so that the hope of winning the war is not in doubt, and that the people understand the situation they are facing. The purpose of this is to make the people understand the situation they are facing. Most of the various documents that have been published, which make the people believe that everything is going smoothly, come from government personnel. Months ago, we did not expect that we would lose our food source from the Scandinavian Peninsula, or that we would soon encounter a situation where Dutch food would no longer be shipped to England for supply. We have been repeatedly deceived by public reports. What is the truth of the food problem now? We should inform the people with real facts and promote its organization based on real wartime economy. I am very disappointed with the information that the Prime Minister can give us now, and I am also dissatisfied with the explanations given by Hall and Stanley. I want to know what kind of information the government received about what Germany intended to do before the German invasion of Norway, and what preparations the government made to prevent the German invasion of Norway.

<p>Washington The White House issued a statement yesterday denying reports that the United States had offered to mediate the European war to the Italian Prime Minister. The statement said, "The White House absolutely denies the newspaper reports that President Roosevelt ordered the US Ambassador to Italy, Philip, to offer to mediate the European war to Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. President Roosevelt believes that this news is completely wrong and has no basis." (United Press, 9th)</p>
<p>Rome Gaeda, the mouthpiece of Mussolini, wrote an article in the "Italian Daily" yesterday discussing the Gibraltar issue, saying that the Anglo-French control of the Strait of Gibraltar and the Suez Canal violates the principles of European freedom and justice. If the Allies think that occupying Gibraltar and the Suez Canal can control the Mediterranean Sea, it is a major mistake. Recently, the authoritative newspaper "Messaggero" criticized the British for asking Italy to explain its true attitude towards the European war, and accused the Allies of trying to expand the war to the Mediterranean Sea to make up for their defeat in Norway. The newspaper said in an editorial, "Italy, as a non-belligerent country, does not need to obtain the satisfaction of Britain. The Italian people are satisfied, because they know their needs and support their leaders." The newspaper also discussed the possible expansion of the European war, saying that "the goal of this demonstration by Britain is very obvious. After the Allies were defeated in Norway and lost the iron ore in Northern Europe, they are now preparing to extend the scope of the war to the Balkans and the Near East to cut off Germany's oil supply and create unrest and terror." (United Press, 9th)</p>
<p>Vatican City The Pope recently gave a speech in a church where believers gathered, claiming that the European war may spread to a wider area, and urged all believers to pray sincerely for peace. The Pope also said that today's world is poisoned by infidelity and disbelief, and his face was full of sorrow and he could not help but sigh. (United Press, 8th)</p>
<p>Vatican City The Pope recently addressed thousands of newly married couples in the Vatican, mentioning the possibility of the European war affecting other countries, saying that if human power cannot now reverse the tide and immediately re-establish a just, faithful, and lasting peace, then people can still pray for God's intervention to unite their children in peace again. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>Rome Italian newspapers' attacks on the Vatican newspaper "L'Osservatore Romano" have become increasingly fierce. The "Fascist Regime" newspaper criticizes it harshly almost every day, and the "Tribune" has also joined the attack on "L'Osservatore Romano" because of its pro-Allied stance. Roman news vendors are now unwilling to sell the newspaper, so the number of people reading the newspaper here has been greatly reduced. (Haitong, 9th)</p>
<p>New York The New York Times recently published a dispatch from its Rome correspondent stating that "President Roosevelt had expressed to Prime Minister Mussolini his willingness to mediate the European war, but was rejected by Mussolini. Although his tone was euphemistic, his intention was extremely firm... At that time, the US Ambassador to Italy, Philip, handed over a letter handwritten by President Roosevelt to Prime Minister Mussolini. The content did not contain any special suggestions, only expressing his willingness to mediate, and that he would inform him in detail after Mussolini accepted it in principle. After reading the letter carefully, Mussolini said to Ambassador Philip that President Roosevelt's expression was extremely admirable, but unfortunately, under the current circumstances, it was difficult to find a basis for negotiation, and the time was not suitable for the appeasement movement. He would reply to President Roosevelt in his personal name. The next day, Foreign Minister Ciano handed over a reply to Ambassador Philip, confirming what the Prime Minister had said."

<p>Sofia British Ambassador to Turkey Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen visited Sofia for a week. On the day of his departure from Sofia, Colonel Gantchev, a famous Bulgarian military writer, published an article in the "Slovo" newspaper, discussing the intentions of the Allies. His article stated that after the Allies were defeated in Norway, they now want to blockade Germany in Southern Europe. However, there are three major obstacles to the Allies' plan: the Soviet Union, Turkey, and Italy. If the British fleet is not able to invade the Black Sea, then the plan to blockade Germany in Southern Europe will be impossible. Because Turkey does not want to offend the Soviet Union, it is difficult for it to tolerate the Allies invading the Black Sea. Italy is also of great importance in this regard. (Haitong, 9th)</p>

Foreign observers estimate that the Netherlands has a total of 600,000 soldiers, pilots, and auxiliary personnel, ready to fight. The authorities seem to be taking nothing lightly. Flat avenues and other open spaces in the Netherlands have been made unusable as landing sites for troop transport aircraft where necessary. At the same time, the authorities are now searching for suspicious individuals. Soldiers were not allowed to take leave, but now they are allowed to do so.

Political figures say that Britain is unable to know exactly what the content of the German-Soviet commercial agreement is, so the Soviet Union must provide guarantees to Britain, declaring that after British goods are imported into the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union will not directly resell them to Germany, nor will it use its own inventory to supply Germany, but will use British goods to replenish them. In addition, to what extent Britain must purchase goods from the Soviet Union in order to prevent Germany from obtaining supplies from the Soviet Union to continue the war is also not known to the British government and must be explained by the Soviet government.

A large naval fleet was advancing, clearly identifiable as heavy cruisers and capital ships, followed by escorted transport ships. At that time, the British ships detected the aircraft and immediately opened fire with anti-aircraft guns. The squadron leader then sought the most advantageous position and directed each aircraft to begin bombing. One bomb hit a British capital ship, immediately causing thick black smoke to rise. This was followed by a thunderous explosion, clearly indicating a hit on an ammunition magazine. Consequently, flames soared into the sky, engulfing the entire ship, which sank within minutes. In addition, one heavy cruiser and one transport ship were also hit and caught fire. The squadron leader then issued a signal to return to base. All aircraft then climbed to high altitude and safely returned to their original base without any losses. (Haitong dispatch, 9th)</p>

<p>London. The opposition Labour Party is scheduled to hold its annual conference on the 13th of this month in Bournemouth. At that time, the issue of whether the party should join the current cabinet will be discussed. All parties now support the inclusion of representatives from the Labour Party and the Liberal Party to form a unified national cabinet. This Labour Party Congress is therefore all the more important. Members of the House of Commons believe that increasing wartime production is an urgent task, so cooperation from the Labour Party is essential. However, it is not yet known whether Prime Minister Chamberlain intends to co-opt Labour leaders into the cabinet. Even if this were to happen, the Labour Party is likely to reject it based on its principle of non-cooperation with Chamberlain. Under these circumstances, Prime Minister Chamberlain has only two options: one is to temporarily maintain the status quo with his current unreliable majority party, and the other is to step down in a timely manner. After all, Prime Minister Chamberlain can calmly choose what to do during the ten-day parliamentary recess. At the same time, the Labour Party can also take advantage of this annual conference to decide on its attitude. (Havas dispatch, 9th)</p>

<p>Budapest. Yesterday, there were two facts that were indicative of improved Soviet-Hungarian relations: first, the local official newspaper "Az Est" published an article stating that the redeployment of Soviet Marshal Voroshilov had reduced the possibility of Soviet aggression against Hungary; second, according to reliable sources, the Soviet government has agreed to sell large quantities of timber to Hungary in exchange for Hungarian products. This transaction will be handled by Hungarian private companies and facilitated by the government. (United Press dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>Budapest. The "Politikai Ujság" recently reported that it is rumored that the German authorities have requested the Hungarian authorities to allow German troops to transit through Hungary.

<h3 id="e45">Japanese Side Again Attempts to Delay Restoration of Hongkou Police Authority, Using Court Issues as a Pretext. Shanghai West Special Police Force Also Indefinitely Postponed <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>According to reliable sources, the Japanese side is using the issue of the Special District Court as a pretext to refuse the Shanghai Municipal Council's recovery of police authority in the Hongkou E District. Stirling Fessenden, the Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council, denied yesterday that the Japanese side had included the condition that "civil and criminal cases of Hongkou residents shall not be handled by the Special District Court" in the negotiations on the return of police authority in Hongkou. However, he did not deny that the negotiations between the two sides have not yet yielded any results.</p>
<p>Hongkou Cases Still Referred to Special Court</p>
<p>According to a spokesman for the Shanghai Municipal Council yesterday, there are currently no difficulties in referring Chinese residents in the Hongkou District to the Special District Court. Some time ago, the Japanese side had established a "fake court" on Haining Road in Hongkou to handle cases involving Chinese residents within its sphere of influence. Although there is currently no indication as to whether the Shanghai Municipal Council will establish another agency in Hongkou to handle civil and criminal litigation cases in the Hongkou District after the Hongkou police negotiations are completed, the Chinese and foreign community will never allow it to happen.</p>
<p>Japanese Police Chief Has Arrived in Shanghai from Japan</p>
<p>The Japanese police chief of the Hongkou District, Furuya, recently arrived in Shanghai from Japan. Afterwards, he met with the Commissioner of Police of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Bourne, for discussions. According to the Japanese side, they hope that the Shanghai Municipal Council will appoint Furuya as the police chief of the E District. At that time, the Japanese police officers under his jurisdiction from Jiaxing Road to Tiendong Road may also be confirmed by the Shanghai Municipal Council.</p>
<p>No Progress in Shanghai West Negotiations</p>
<p>According to Shanghai Municipal Council Commissioner of Police Bourne yesterday, regarding the negotiations on the establishment of the Shanghai West "Special Police," the Shanghai Municipal Council submitted its final proposal to the head of the puppet "Police Bureau," Lu Ying, last week, but has not yet received a response from the puppet side. The date for the next meeting has also not been set. It is heard that this proposal was drafted based on the results of the meeting between the two sides ten days ago. It is still difficult to predict whether the puppet side's response will satisfy the Shanghai Municipal Council in the future. However, the Shanghai Municipal Council has decided to step up supervision of this matter to ensure that the two sides can reach a final decision as soon as possible and realize its "Special Police" organization within the next month. As for the content of the negotiations between the two sides, Bourne believes that it is not yet time for official release, so he refuses to reveal the truth.</p>

<p>Yesterday was the May Ninth National Humiliation Commemoration Day, which is the day in the fourth year of the Republic when Yuan Shikai, delusional of restoring the monarchy, violated the public trust of the nation and acknowledged the humiliating Twenty-One Demands. Yesterday, all sectors of the city voluntarily suspended entertainment banquets, and all Chinese radio stations also suspended broadcasting entertainment programs to show that they would not forget the national humiliation. At this time, the war of resistance has entered a favorable stage, and reports of victory are frequently received from the front lines. The goal of avenging the humiliation and strengthening the country is not far away. The citizens of the city, amidst somber commemoration, all embrace infinite enthusiasm.</p>
<h3 id="e47">The Market Price of Coal Balls Drops Back to $8.50 Per Load Yesterday <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>Due to speculation, coal balls and raw coal dross were manipulated, resulting in a shortage of goods on the market. The ex-factory price of coal balls at Panmen even broke all previous records. Now, each of the large coal ball factories has separately launched the sale of cheap coal balls. Yesterday, the market was more stable, and the inventory of goods increased somewhat. For a time, the market price of various coal materials turned downstream, and the market price of coal balls fell by twelve yuan, opening at 164 yuan. Each load fell by nine cents, opening at 8.50 yuan. In addition, Yitai Xing Coal Ball Factory is scheduled to sell labor coal balls from the 11th to the 30th of this month, selling 60 loads of cheap coal balls every day, with a limit of 15 catties per person, totaling one yuan in national currency. The time is from 9:30 am every day until the quota is full. A total of five sales offices have been set up: (1) 380 Maigen Road, (2) 393 Aierjin Road, (3) 390 Lafaide Road, (4) 564 Xujiahui Road, (5) 358 Wenlin Road.</p>
<h3 id="e48">Coal Dross Priced in US Dollars. Coal Industry Talks About the Reasons, Calling It Nothing Strange <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>The fact that the coal dross market is priced in US dollars has attracted attention from all walks of life. Because the change in the currency unit of raw materials is indirectly related to the daily life of citizens, according to the coal industry, "pricing in US dollars is indeed the case, but this specifically refers to coal companies ordering foreign coal from foreign companies such as Hongji India. Domestic coal materials and market transactions are still calculated in national currency. The changes in the currency system for ordering foreign coal were settled in national currency before the war. After 'August 13th,' they were changed to be priced in French francs. In March of last year, the unit was shillings. Since April 1st of this year, various foreign coal transactions have gradually adopted US dollar pricing. This change depends on changes in exchange rates and adapts to various factual needs. There is nothing strange about the decision." However, the inventory in this city is abundant, and it is the goods that were imported before the exchange rate changes. The excuse of increasing prices is obviously a smoke screen released by speculators.</p>
<h3 id="e49">The French Municipal Council Decides to Stabilize Prices and Takes Concrete Steps. The Solution Can Be Announced Today. Acts in Concert with the Public Concession. Key Personnel from Both Concessions Attend the Meeting <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>This dramatic change in exchange rates has not only caused foreign goods, but also domestic products to uniformly raise their prices, which not only affects the livelihood of ordinary people, but also relates to local security. After research by the various subcommittees of the French Municipal Council's Equalization Committee, "it has been confirmed that the current situation has indeed reached the principles stipulated in Order No. 78 of the French Consulate General of February 19 this year. However, after confirmation that it is necessary, and if merchants are not satisfied with reasonable profits, then price limits should be set later." A concrete plan for stabilizing prices has already been drafted and submitted to the General Assembly for approval yesterday. It was decided to consult with the Public Concession Price Control Committee today and submit it to the French Consul General in Shanghai, Ochi, for approval, and to implement it publicly from today.</p>
<p>Meeting Situation</p>
<p>Yesterday's General Assembly started at 5 pm in the French Municipal Council on Xiafei Road. More than a dozen Chinese and French members were present. The Chinese members included Wan Molin, Zhao Zhiyou, Jin Zhixuan, Lu Gaoyi, Yao Zhongba, and others. Qi Zhi was unable to attend due to his trip to Hong Kong. J. Brediar, the director of the French Municipal Council, attended and discussed in detail the reports submitted by the three subcommittees and the concrete measures drafted to stabilize prices and crack down on hoarding and excessive profits. After two hours, the resolutions were passed and it was decided to send the passed cases to the Public Concession Price Control Committee today for consultation, and to submit them to French Consul General Ochi for approval. It is expected to be officially announced and implemented this afternoon. As for the establishment of food production and sales agencies proposed by Kui Yanfang, it was submitted to the Public Concession Shanghai Municipal Council Price Control Committee, so it was not discussed at yesterday's meeting. However, it is understood that the committee attaches great importance to this suggestion.</p>
<p>Acting in Concert</p>
<p>A reporter from the Great China News Agency met with a member of the Equalization Committee yesterday. The reporter asked how imported rice and coal could be stabilized due to foreign exchange issues. It was said that this was a point that all the members present at the meeting had been thinking about and trying to solve. The committee is determined to overcome all difficulties and stabilize prices to alleviate the difficulties encountered by citizens. A member also expressed in a firm tone that he would never allow the Equalization Committee to become an empty organization or the price stabilization measures to become mere words. Because the current prices and their trends have made it impossible for the general public to bear them, forcing the Concession authorities to take concrete steps to crack down on manipulation and speculation. As for the detailed measures, they have now been drafted and will be translated into Chinese tonight and submitted to the Consul General for approval tomorrow, and to seek the consent of the Public Concession authorities. It is expected to be announced this afternoon. It is noted that the steps taken by the French Concession Equalization Food Committee in the past, in addition to forcing merchants to display the prices of daily necessities, have also announced average price lists for daily necessities to show price restrictions, and designated the Central, Baoxu, Beidang, Xiafei, Mailan, and Xiao Dongdou Five Police Stations to handle complaints. All events in which the public raises prices too high and the degree of quality on goods are fraudulent, can be accused to the above five places, but it is heard that there are not many cases received in the past, and merchants who have been unscrupulous have gone their own way. Yesterday's third general meeting decided to take further action.</p>
<p>Adjusting Grain Prices</p>
<p>According to a reporter from the Pingming News Agency, the Public Concession Shanghai Municipal Council Food Committee will meet at 4 pm today to discuss in detail the price adjustments of rice, flour, and general goods. British Chamber of Commerce President Marshall Shishi will chair the meeting, and West Committee members Wei Lai, Glen, Hongke, Hedanhaige, Chinese Committee member Li Wenjie, and Japanese Committee member Sugimura will attend the meeting. It is heard that the Special District Court of this city has also cooperated in cracking down on price increases, and there have recently been several cases of punishing profiteers.</p>
<p>State of Unease</p>
<p>Dalu News reported that, according to observers, since the devaluation of the French currency last week, the prices of food, rent, clothing, fuel, and other important commodities in the city have increased by ten to twenty-five percent, making the situation of the working class, which accounts for the vast majority of the population in Shanghai, increasingly dangerous and difficult to live on. If the wages of these people are not increased, it will be difficult to maintain their lives. Therefore, some factories have experienced labor disputes due to workers demanding wage increases. The price index of this city, with 1936 as the basic index of 100, has reached 473 for food, 349 for rent, 291 for clothing, 541 for fuel, which has increased the most, and 427 for miscellaneous items. The general index is on average as high as 453.</p>
<p>The above figures</p>
<p>Although not detailed, are sufficient to see the general picture of rising prices. According to observers in this city, the salaried class is now in a very difficult situation, so all parties believe that unless the authorities of various companies, agencies, and business firms can increase their salaries appropriately, it will be difficult to maintain their daily lives. According to investigations, several large factories are currently studying this issue, but according to general estimates, what factories can do for workers may only be to add some salary and rice subsidies. On average, the wages of Chinese workers have increased by about 50 percent since March 1938, but compared with the cost of living index, the extent of price increases is still minimal. Recently, the supply of pigs, chickens and ducks in Shanghai has also been in short supply. The original cows that could not supply the needs of this city in northern Jiangsu are said to have only sold three chickens on the market in the southern city on the 7th of this month, which is unprecedented in the history of Shanghai.</p>

Chairman Powell and Committee Members from All Countries Will Attend <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>After the Shanghai Municipal Council's Economic Committee passed the expansion of the committee members from four to twelve at this year's tax meeting, it was announced by the consulates of various countries on the 2nd of this month. According to accurate information obtained by a reporter from the Pingming News Agency, the first meeting of the committee has been scheduled for the afternoon of the 14th of this month to discuss the issue of reducing the Shanghai Municipal Council's administrative expenses and other general economic matters related to the bureau. At that time, British committee member Powell will chair the meeting, and committee members from all countries will attend on schedule.</p>
<p>The Financial Situation Has Become Stable</p>
<p>According to sources close to the Shanghai Municipal Council authorities, the Bureau's $16 million public bonds were fully subscribed within three hours. Of this, $12 million was used to repay bank overdrafts, and the remaining funds were used as working capital. It also purchased 100,000 pounds of British gold a week before the black market shrank sharply, so the exchange rate difference for the Bureau's Western employees' foreign exchange will not be affected. The proposal to increase the municipal surtax by 51% was also passed at the tax meeting and will be implemented from July. In addition, administrative expenses were reduced, and many senior Western officials were dismissed. In particular, a number of senior Western officials were dismissed from the restructured Public Works Department, so the Bureau's financial situation has become greatly stabilized.</p>
<p>A Large Number of Western Employees Have Been Dismissed One After Another</p>
<p>As for the Bureau's efforts to save expenses, several senior Western officials have retired one after another, and the Public Works Department has been reorganized, and nine senior Western officials who were deemed unnecessary to continue were dismissed in the past two months. They include Senior Assistant Engineer Balingdun, Senior Assistant Real Estate Surveyor Fabolao, Engineer of Horse Power Widefei, Landscape Supervisor Keer, Senior Public Works Officer Tuomais, Assistant Naide, Heating Equipment Engineer Shiweiqufu Keji, Director of Civil Engineering Huazhen, Senior Assistant Engineer Jinssi, etc.</p>

<p>The Italian postal ship Conti Rosso, which loaded passengers and cargo in Italy at the beginning of last month and sailed to the Far East, arrived at the port at 5 pm yesterday and berthed at the Shuntai Wharf. This time, it carried 626 passengers, including many Jews and retired Chinese employees of German ships, as well as a large amount of cargo. Since the outbreak of the European War, the voyage of ships sailing from Europe to the Far East has been slow. Recently, as the war has intensified, the sailing time has become even longer. At this time of changing circumstances and uncertainty, the dynamics of European shipping are closely watched by all parties. In addition, it is widely rumored that British and French ships will change their routes or reduce the number of voyages. European ships, which have close commercial relations, have become the focus of the entire shipping industry.</p>
<h3 id="e52">After Clarification from the Ministry of Finance, Shanghai Market Confidence Strengthens; Foreign Exchange Eases, Black Market Gold Continues to Decline, Public Bonds Stabilize, Financial Market Optimistic <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, the Banking and Money Trade Association, received official communication from Yang Jun of the Ministry of Finance, emphasizing the lack of restrictions on withdrawals, and the government's determination to maintain currency stability and financial security. Yesterday, they sent telegrams to various trade associations and banks and money houses to comply. A reporter from the "New Voice" news agency learned from the financial market yesterday that the British HSBC bank, which is listed on the foreign exchange black market, kept the exchange rate for British currency unchanged. The exchange rate for US currency shrank by 0.0625. Due to the ongoing maintenance by the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund, and because HSBC is supplying legitimate needs of various industries, the actual exchange market trend is upward. The price of gold on the black market has continued to fall, and the prices of various foreign currencies and foreign stocks have also declined. The prices of commodities such as rice, coal, and yarn have fallen back, but the unified public bonds in the securities market are trending upward, which is a sign of financial market stabilization.</p>
<p>Restricting the Flow of Legal Tender into Occupied Areas</p>
<p>In addition to restricting the supply of foreign exchange in the Shanghai black market (not a complete stoppage, but rather to prevent Japanese purchasing), the government is also restricting residents of free areas of China from transporting legal tender into occupied areas. It is reported that the Zhejiang Provincial Customs authorities have received instructions from the government that residents wishing to go to the occupied areas are only allowed to carry a maximum of 50 yuan in legal tender. Government measures on this matter were remembered to have been established earlier, with the only change being the amount of legal tender. It is said that the initial limit was 500 yuan, later reduced to 200 yuan, and now it has been reduced for the third time to 90 yuan.</p>
<p>Financial Newspaper Reports on Market Fluctuations</p>
<p>A recently published English financial and commercial newspaper stated that the foreign exchange market on Monday of last week appeared weak due to the emergence of those holding April futures. The British exchange rate reached 4 and 3/16 pence. HSBC absorbed at this exchange rate, but it is unknown whether it was on behalf of the Equalization Fund or for customers. Before the close of trading in the afternoon, and on Tuesday, April foreign exchange futures were fully settled.</p>
<p>Sellers Disappear</p>
<p>When there was a large demand for foreign exchange in commercial circles, the exchange rate tended to decline. On Tuesday evening, the Equalization Fund intervened to maintain the British exchange rate at 4 and 1/8 pence. On Tuesday, rumors intensified, because some Americans in the city wired Washington requesting the US government to lend money to China to maintain its currency, which further</p>
<p>Disturbed Public Sentiment</p>
<p>This move led some people to speculate that the Equalization Fund would soon be exhausted. This news was unfavorable to the foreign exchange market, but it should not be assumed that the Fund's subsequent cessation of foreign exchange supply was related to this news. There is absolutely no basis for the claim that the Equalization Fund is depleted. On the contrary, the Fund has at least two to three million pounds. However, we cannot forget that</p>
<p>The Equalization Fund</p>
<p>is not used to stop long-term adverse exchange rate trends. Its purpose is to prevent sharp fluctuations in the exchange market. No exchange equalization fund can maintain a shrinking exchange rate caused by a long-term trade deficit. Last week, this publication reported that a banking conference was held in Hong Kong to discuss the issue of temporarily suspending the Fund's activities and allowing the legal tender to find its natural level. It was reported that the meeting concluded that maintaining the fixed price of 4 and 1/8 pence would only deplete the Fund. As a result, the bank responsible for balancing exchange rates in this city received a telegram from Hong Kong on Wednesday night to stop supplying.</p>

<p>The "Continental Daily" reported that a Japanese army spokesperson yesterday (the 8th) praised the valor of three young Chinese soldiers at a press conference. It was stated that the Japanese army had repeatedly encountered extremely brave Chinese soldiers. On the 4th of this month, a Japanese army unit advanced to a location ten kilometers south of Suixian, where they were blocked by gunfire from two fortresses. The Japanese army found it very difficult to capture the fortresses, and finally dispatched a "suicide squad" to bravely capture one of the fortresses. After the other fortress was destroyed by the Japanese army with the assistance of the engineer corps, it became silent. When the Japanese soldiers approached the destroyed fortress, they were very surprised, because the ones holding it were three young Chinese soldiers. Judging from the position of their bodies, it was clear that they had just put down their machine guns and were preparing to charge out with hand grenades. The Japanese soldiers were "deeply moved" by their bravery in combat.</p>

<p>Foreign nationals in this city are currently promoting "Summer Time," also known as "Daylight Saving Time," which involves starting work an hour earlier during the summer, generally from May 1st to the end of September, so that they can have more daylight leisure time after finishing work in the afternoon. Many Chinese and foreign commercial firms in Shanghai have already implemented this by bringing forward their office hours by one hour. Similarly, the embassy district in Dongjiaomin Lane in Beijing and Tianjin have also implemented it. Several major cities in the United States, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Canada, Ireland, and other countries have also adopted "Summer Time." The benefit is that the morning temperatures are cooler when leaving home for work in the summer, and it is not yet dusk after finishing work, allowing for beneficial outdoor exercise. In addition, commercial firms can also save on electricity bills.</p>

<p>Already Requested to the Postmaster General</p>
<p>The entire staff of the Shanghai Postal Administration requested on the 20th of last month to the authorities to uniformly change their living allowances to 50 yuan, along with requests for coal briquette and vegetable oil allowances, due to the sharp contraction of foreign exchange, soaring prices, and difficult living conditions. The authorities indicated that they would consider increasing allowances after postage rates were increased. However, because the postage rate increase did not materialize, the entire staff felt that increasing allowances was becoming increasingly remote. However, in the current situation of soaring prices, it is difficult to maintain living standards with their current salaries. Although they currently receive rice subsidies and living allowances each month, the amounts are limited and do not provide much relief. Therefore, yesterday, the entire staff submitted a letter to Postmaster General Chapelin, requesting a uniform increase of 60 yuan in living allowances, and also telegraphed the Kunming General Administration. They also requested Mr. Chapelin to provide one month's allowance in advance to alleviate their immediate needs before receiving a reply from Kunming. It is reported that the authorities are considering this request.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Banking Association, with the approval of the Ministry of Finance, issued aluminum one-cent and five-cent coins with a total value of 50 million coins, equally divided between one-cent and five-cent coins, totaling 1.5 million national currency. These were minted by the American Arctic Company and shipped to Shanghai in batches for distribution. In addition to the first two batches already issued, the third batch of 5 million coins has also arrived in Shanghai for distribution, managed by the Joint Reserve Committee of Banks, the Joint Reserve Depository of Money Houses, and HSBC for distribution to member banks for circulation in the market. Subsequent batches will continue to be shipped to Shanghai and distributed as needed. As for the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank, it was specially authorized by the former Ministry of Finance to issue one-cent and five-cent fractional currency notes with a total value of 7 million national currency. 3.5 million, printed by the American Yongduo Company and already issued in batches, are now widely circulating in the Shanghai market. After this, future batches will be issued as needed depending on market demand. As a result, the coinage shortage panic in the Shanghai market has been completely resolved. The premium for exchanging coins at small money houses has been automatically canceled. Furthermore, the value vouchers issued by the Shanghai Electric Military Company, the French Tram Company, and public buses have been continuously withdrawn.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Machine-Made Noodle Industry Association, in compliance with the authorities' instructions to sell affordable noodles, held a meeting of the entire executive and supervisory committee at the Tongle Tea Garden on Zhejiang Road at 3 PM yesterday. The following resolutions were made: (1) Request flour mills and flour merchants not to deliberately raise prices to benefit the people's food supply; (2) The retail and wholesale price of noodles will remain at the original price of 28 cents per city jin, complying with the authorities' advice not to raise prices; (3) Investigate the retail prices of flour merchants, and report any price increases to the authorities for sanctions; (4) Request flour merchants to publicly display prices and not engage in illegal private transactions.</p>
<p>Japanese Control</p>
<p>The weather this spring is fine, and there is hope for a good harvest of spring crops. The earliest new wheat will be available on the market at the end of the month. Therefore, local Chinese flour mills, grain merchants, and others are preparing to send people to the production areas to purchase wheat. However, according to those close to the industry, someone has harsh plans to implement control over flour and wheat in the near future.</p>
<p>Flour Merchants Worried</p>
<p>Chinese commercial firms and factories have always relied on imported foreign wheat for pricing, but the sharp contraction of foreign exchange has increased the price by 75%. A small amount of unsettled payments has already resulted in huge losses. They are planning to shift to local wheat to reduce losses. Now that there is a move to control, they not only have no interest in sending people to purchase wheat amidst the double pressure of internal and external troubles, but they also have concerns about not being able to maintain their original business.</p>

<p>Since the outbreak of the European war, British shipping companies sailing to the Far East have been ordered to add armaments to all large and small ships for self-defense, in order to avoid attacks by enemy warships. Yesterday, according to shipping industry sources, the British naval authorities have previously strengthened the British ship's armed self-defense capabilities, and are now sending personnel to inspect the armaments of each ship. If necessary, they plan to strengthen its military equipment to achieve thoroughness, or stipulate that the equipment of armed merchant ships is a military secret, and no one may disclose the content of the armed equipment. At the same time, for precautionary purposes, the major merchant shipping companies are instructed to implement wartime restrictions on personnel boarding merchant ships. When ships are berthed, boarding should be prohibited except for passengers and cargo passengers. It is reported that both Taikoo and Jardine shipping companies have complied, and have issued notices that boarding is not allowed on any ships belonging to the company except for passengers and cargo passengers.</p>

<h3 id="e61">Child Traffickers Given Heavy Sentences Separately; Each Sentenced to More Than Ten Years Imprisonment and Fines; French Police Also Transferred for Investigation and Prosecution <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Yang Xin, a detective from the Jiaxing Road police station, and detective Zhang Decai, previously uncovered a large-scale human trafficking operation at Fuxinxiang Grocery Store, No. 355 Baoding Road, Hongkou, and arrested ten men and women, including Ling Rongsen and Ling Zhangshi. They recovered two abducted children, Zhang Dingkang and Chuan Bingkui, along with more than a hundred pieces of children's clothing, shoes, hats, photos, and other items, and brought them to the police station. It was discovered that these people had committed</p>
<p>More than a Hundred Trafficking Cases</p>
<p>within the boundary, and the abducted children were all under the age of ten, mostly sold to Xiamen and Fuzhou. Under these special circumstances, the police station was unable to go out to investigate. Now, more than fifty pieces of clothing have been recognized by their owners. The police station's lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, in addition to prosecuting according to the criminal law for repeated offenses, also requested that the defendants be given the maximum penalty for the heinous nature of the cases. After several rounds of interrogation and debate, Xiao Peishen, a judge, took the seat in the Second Criminal Court yesterday morning and announced the verdict: Ling Rongsen, Ling Zhangshi, Dai Lushi, Wang Li Fu, Wang Wushi, and Zhuge Qianshi, continuously and jointly</p>
<p>Intended to Profit</p>
<p>By abducting males under the age of sixteen and separating them from their families, each sentenced to fifteen years of imprisonment, deprived of public office for ten years, and fined 1,500 yuan each. Lu Wenzhong and Zhuge Chun, each sentenced to fourteen years of imprisonment, deprived of public office for ten years, and fined 800 yuan each. Cui Tengshi sentenced to twelve years of imprisonment, deprived of public office for ten years, and fined 800 yuan. The fine can be converted to labor service at a rate of six months per amount. Wang Zhangshi is innocent, and the recognized clothing will be returned after the verdict is confirmed. After the sentencing, the judge announced to the defendants, "The cases you have committed are</p>
<p>Extremely Heinous</p>
<p>and there is no leniency under the law. Therefore, you should be given the maximum penalty to serve as a warning." Regarding the civil part, the defendants were ordered to return the abducted people to the plaintiffs. The police station lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, stated that he would waive the appeal for the innocent part of Wang Zhangshi. Subsequently, Yan Jinwen, a detective from the Criminal Division of the French Police, submitted a public document to the Second Special Court, stating that the defendants had committed many similar cases in the French Concession and requested permission for extradition. The court deliberated that the nine defendants, including Ling Rongsen, be handed over to the French Police officers, along with Wang Zhangshi. The clothing and photos should be</p>
<p>Transferred for Verification</p>
<p>After the announcement, the defendants were taken away by the detectives separately. However, the family members of the abducted children, totaling dozens, mostly women, were present in court. Among them were widows and women in their fifties, whose children were abducted and could not be found. They all held deep hatred. When the defendants were taken out of the courtroom, they surrounded each other, hitting and kicking, wishing they could devour them alive.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Second Special District Local Court and the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, located at the intersection of Yu Jia Lane, Xue Hua Li Road, and Ma Dang Road in the French Concession, suddenly increased security measures from 8 AM yesterday. In addition to detectives from the police station being stationed to protect the premises, French judicial police officers, along with Chinese judicial police, were stationed outside the main entrance and side entrances, as well as at all entrances and exits, under the command of the French judicial police officers. For the parties to the lawsuit, only those with summonses were allowed to enter the court to report. Those requesting to attend the hearing and the parties who did not hold summonses were not allowed to enter. However, those holding long-term listening permits were an exception. Furthermore, the staff and lawyers of the two courts were also required to show their badges to enter and exit. The sudden increase in security measures was rare and unprecedented since the start of the war. According to rumors, the reason for the special increase in security measures by the two courts was that the court authorities received threats, so special security measures were implemented for protection. It was also reported that the two courts notified the police station to send additional detectives to provide special protection for all staff.</p>

<h3 id="e63">Westerner Returns to Shanghai Discussing European War and Far East Commerce; Observations on Future Air and Sea Battle <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>It has been several months since the so-called Second European War broke out. We have seen information from both the Allies and Germany, and we can get a clearer picture of the progress of the war. But how exactly will this large-scale war in Europe progress? As the war drags on day by day, what will be the future of the Far East? These questions seem worthy of our study. Before we speculate, we should know that the so-called large-scale decisive battle, in terms of the naval and air forces of Britain, France, and Germany, will inevitably involve fierce naval and air battles as a measure of the strength of both sides. As for the relationship with the Far East, as it stands now, foreign exchange fluctuations, international trade—especially changes related to China—are all significantly related. Yesterday, a reporter met a Westerner who had just returned to Shanghai from Europe. He has lived in Shanghai for a long time and runs a large business. According to him, China's foreign market has not been adversely affected by China's resistance war. On the contrary, due to the needs of foreign markets and the efforts of the Chinese people, the export side has a considerable advantage. As for the fluctuations in foreign exchange, there is certainly more than one reason, but according to his personal observation, since the Chinese government is determined to maintain it, and the situation of the resistance war is moving in a favorable direction, there should be no accidents. This is something that all knowledgeable people should recognize, so this Westerner's views are mostly very optimistic!</p>
<p>The reporter also asked him about the current situation of the European war and his observations on future air and sea battles, which are detailed as follows:</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Western European war, a crisis has been lurking everywhere in continental Europe, with every place preparing to explode. In general, people feel that if peace cannot be established quickly, the war will inevitably expand. In the past few months, not only Western European countries like Belgium and the Netherlands, but also Southeastern European countries like Romania have been in a state of anxiety and turmoil, and countries in the Near East have also found it difficult to sleep soundly. Recently, Germany's battle line has not taken the southeast direction, but has gone northwest, which seems somewhat unexpected. Instead of driving its mechanized troops into Hungary or Romania, it used its navy, which is far inferior to the British and French Allied forces, to attack the Scandinavian Peninsula in Northern Europe, occupying Denmark in 24 hours and landing at several important seaports along the coast of Norway. After analyzing this sudden move, we can find two reasons: First, its abandonment of the southeast plant is unwilling to lose the friendship of the Soviet Union and Italy; second, its occupation of Northern Europe can directly threaten northern Britain and the British Orkney Islands and Shetland Islands.</p>
<p>So far in the Northern European war, Allied troops have quickly landed in Norway to stop the German advance and have achieved some results. In fact, because the Allied forces did not obtain airfields in Norway that could be used by fighter planes, the German army was able to exert its air power to prevent the advance of Allied reinforcements. Germany has already paid a considerable price to gain a slight advantage, and the Allies have avoided temporary losses and made plans to temporarily withdraw troops from the Trondheim area of Norway, which has indeed shown agile and flexible tactics. After this, the tightening of the British blockade in the North Sea and the seeking of new military developments in Norway are of course inevitable. The state of Northern Europe in the past few weeks is just a ripple in the course of the war and cannot be used as any argument. The British and French Allied forces will certainly continue to use their superior naval power to fight, and the Skagerrak and Kattegat straits will be the battlefield for air and sea battles between the two sides. In the future, large-scale air and sea battles will inevitably occur continuously. So, let's take a look at the strength of both sides. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e64">Xiangtai Timber Yard Labor Dispute; Worker Arrested for Assault; Six Offenders Escorted to Court Yesterday for Interrogation and Detention <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>At 8:45 AM on the 8th, at the Yangshupu Road 1426, the Chinese-owned Xiangtai Timber Yard, sawyers elected a representative, Li Fengqi from Shandong, to request increased wages and rice subsidies from the Western manager, but he was unsuccessful. They blamed Li for failing to help, made threatening remarks, and were beaten on the head with iron bars and hammers, resulting in severe injuries and death after some time. Details of the situation have been recorded in this newspaper. Subsequently, detectives Shen Defu, Ji Xiucheng, and Jin Wanrong from the Yangshupu police station, along with Western detectives, rushed to the timber yard,</p>
<p>Apprehended the Murderer</p>
<p>and a total of twenty-five suspects and workers. After questioning those who were not involved, the six suspected workers, Wang Sheng, from Shandong, Liang Shitai, Yin Chengzong, Liang Shiji, Ding Fugui from Jiangbei, and Wang Yide, were arrested, along with the iron bars and iron hammers used as weapons, and taken to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special Court, and police station lawyer Jiang Baolian filed a public prosecution against the defendants for murder,</p>
<p>Stating that, according to investigation, between the 23rd of last month, they gathered and discussed the matter at No. 9 Meizhou Road (i.e., the home of the defendant Liang Shitai). A letter was written by a Mr. Xia, requesting the foreign manager to increase wages, because the prices of rice, noodles, and other items had soared recently. Later, they entrusted the deceased Li Fengqi to represent them and talk to the foreign manager, but it was unsuccessful. They used savage means to beat him to death. Please postpone this case for further investigation. It was found that the defendants Wang Sheng, Yin Chengzong, Liang Shitai, and Ding Fugui, at the time of the murder,</p>
<p>Beating the Deceased the Most Violently</p>
<p>Wang and Liang had blood stains on their short shirts and pants, which they later changed at home. According to Song Yougen from Yongbo and Wang Guisheng from Changzhou, who were contracted to sell firewood and timber at the timber yard, when they entered the yard to do business, the defendants, numbering dozens, prevented them from entering, leading to a conflict. They pointed to the defendants Wang Sheng, Liang Shitai, and Ding Fugui, who used iron bars and water pipes to beat them violently, causing injuries to their heads, backs, and legs.</p>
<p>All Suffered Serious Injuries</p>
<p>They are currently being treated at Shanghai East Hospital. The doctor applied medicine and bandaged their heads before they testified, stating that the defendants Wang, Liang, and Ding were barbaric and rude, and should not have violently beaten them for no reason, requesting prosecution. The defendants insisted that the deceased Li Fengqi favored the Western manager and suppressed them with threatening words. The rest of the testimony was evasive, seeking leniency. Judge Liu Yugui ordered them to be detained and postponed the hearing for further investigation.</p>

<p>Yesterday morning (the 9th) at 8:15 AM, two merchants were discussing business in room 36 of the Jinjiang Hostel on Xingsheng Street when two robbers suddenly broke in. One of them was armed with a pistol and tied one of the merchants to a chair, robbing them of a total of 552 yuan in legal tender and a gold ring. As they fled out the door with the loot, they were spotted by a passerby, who shouted "Robbery!" At that time, a Sikh police officer heard the alarm and fired two shots at the robbers, but both missed. At the same time, he blew his whistle. The robbers also fired several shots. Sergeant Ma Mengtuofu, No. 287 of the French Police, and Patrolman No. 1019 happened to be patrolling the area and rushed to the scene upon hearing the sound. They saw the robbers running east along Gongguan Road and followed them, chasing them to the intersection of Jixiang Street. At that time, Chinese Police Officer No. 1014 fired a shot at the robber, hitting him in the leg. At this time, a Russian named Que Banoff happened to be passing by and bravely captured the robber. The other robber was captured by Chinese Police Officer No. 631 and Patrolman No. 188 at the corner of Gongguan Road and Jixiang Street. The robbers and the stolen goods were taken to the police station. The pistol carried by the robbers still had five bullets in it. After strict interrogation, the robbers confessed that the pistol was supplied by a Mr. Jin, who lived at No. 7 Kangji Lane, Malan Road. Detectives were sent to arrest Mr. Jin, who admitted to providing the firearms without denying it. The robbers will be escorted to the court for trial today.</p>

<p>Large New Court Found</p>
<p>The Green Light Tennis Club was founded fifteen years ago by Wang Wenzheng, Yuan Shilong, Hou Danian, Sun Xin, Li Nan, Wang Wuchen, and others who loved tennis in Nanshi. Over the years, it has participated in various competitions and achieved excellent results. Due to the increasing number of members, the original court on Xinchuan Road was insufficient, so a new site has been found at the intersection of Avenue Notre Dame and Avenue Joffre in the French Concession (formerly the site of the American Teer Field Vans competitions). There are five tennis courts, and the location is convenient, making it the most complete and surviving tennis court for Chinese people in Shanghai. In addition to serving old members, the club has vacancies and welcomes like-minded people to join. Membership fees are divided into ordinary, morning, and women's memberships. Regulations are available. Contact Mr. Wang Wuchen at Jianchen Foreign Firm, 110 Renji Road, telephone number 17663, or Mr. Hong Fangyi at 702 Avenue Joffre, telephone number 78461.</p>

<h3 id="e84">Finance: Foreign Exchange Rates Tend to Ease <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw HSBC's listed exchange rates plummet. The city's U.S. dollar exchange rate continued to be listed at 0.625 lower, while the British pound exchange rate remained unchanged. The domestic market saw more supply than demand, and the easing trend gradually expanded. Operators' paces were uneven, with sudden entries and exits, but there were no significant reactions. Initially, due to exports selling and Sassoon foreign firms selling, the market was hard. Foreign firms and speculators absorbed it, and it once turned flat, but the noon closing was still consistently higher. The initial situation in the after-market showed no rise or fall. Later, news came that Germany had attacked the Netherlands, and the war was intensifying, and people's minds changed again, and sellers hesitated, so the exchange rate slightly tightened, but the result was still loose and hard. The British gold was 3 shillings 468875, and the U.S. dollar was 4.8125 yuan, both up 125 from yesterday's closing. The futures trend was the same as the spot market, with a slightly closer distance.</p>
<p>Sassoon also made sales.</p>
<p>In the early morning, London's large bills, both near and far, fell 125. New York's silver price remained flat, London's raw gold remained stagnant, the British pound against the U.S. dollar was unchanged, against Shanghai it was up 0.625, against France it was unchanged, the U.S. dollar against the British pound was down 4.75, against Shanghai it was up 5 points, and against France it was down 2.5 points. The Central Bank's listed prices remained the same. The bank's spot selling price was 3 shillings 34375 for British gold and 4.625 yuan for the U.S. dollar, with the British pound flat and the U.S. dollar tighter at 0.625 compared to last night's close, due to the continued sharp decline in exchange rates. After opening, exporters first sold spot U.S. dollars to foreign firms at 4.6875 yuan, up to 75 yuan, so the market was already flat and hard. At the same time, foreign firms sold spot British gold to speculators at 3 shillings 34375. HSBC's listed prices were announced, with the British pound unchanged and the U.S. dollar listed at 0.625 softer. The silver balance tax was announced, reducing it by one yuan. After this, due to Sassoon and others all intending to sell, supply exceeded demand. At around 10:30 AM, the May U.S. dollar was trading at 4.65625 yuan. The spot U.S. dollar was sold by foreign firms for 4.75 yuan. Around 10:30 AM, foreign firms and speculators slightly bought in, and the market turned stable. It is estimated that foreign firms absorbed the spot U.S. dollar at 4.6875 yuan, and speculators bought the May U.S. dollar at 4.625 yuan from Chinese banks. It was heard that the June British gold was once traded, with Hong Kong Telecom selling it to foreign firms for 3 shillings 21875, but the transaction volume was not large. Until noon, speculators suddenly bought, and the situation became hardened again. The May British gold traded from 3 shillings 375 to 40625, so the closing result was that both futures and spot prices were rolled over and eased. Spot British gold was 3 shillings 46875, and the U.S. dollar was announced at 4.8125 yuan, both up 125.</p>
<p>Chinese merchants had quite a bit of supply.</p>
<p>After the afternoon opening, it was flat at first, but later it was heard that there would be trading in June, with foreign firms selling June British gold to fellow firms for 3 shillings 12875, and Hong Kong Telecom buying June U.S. dollars from foreign firms for 4.4375 yuan. Subsequently, news came that German troops had attacked the Netherlands, and sellers stopped selling, and the situation weakened. The current U.S. dollar is now at 4.78125 yuan, but Chinese merchants are supplying very well. As a result, at the close, British gold was still 3 shillings 46875, and the U.S. dollar was 4.8125 yuan. The May British gold was 3 shillings 40625, and the U.S. dollar was 4.6875 yuan. Compared with the previous day's close, spot British and U.S. dollars were both up 125. This month, British was loose by 15625, and U.S. hard by 1875.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Exchange Market Stable</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 9th (Thursday) - The exchange market opened flat this morning. British and Shanghai exchange rates were unchanged. The spot U.S. dollar was tight at 25, at 20.5625 yuan.

<h3 id="e85">Amid Exit Rumors, Gold Prices Plummet Again - Lowest Seen at 6,820 Yuan <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot gold market was in a slump throughout the day. The reason was that the exchange market continued to harden, and buying interest in the market subsided. Although securities firms once boosted prices, the amount was small and ineffective, and the downward trend was difficult to reverse. In the morning, it plummeted by 40 yuan, and before a moment had passed, money changers and banks competed to sell, and the price was pressed down to 6,880 yuan. Fortunately, securities firms frequently bought in at this price, causing it to recover by 30 yuan. However, many floating speculators, seeing the high price of 19, had the intention to exit, and at that time, the foreign exchange rate was still rising, and gold firms were also selling, causing the price to fall back to 6,840 yuan. The noon closing was 6,860 yuan. The initial situation in the after-market remained depressed. Retail investors sold in groups, and it fell to 6,820 yuan. Suddenly, news came that Germany had invaded the Netherlands, and the exchange market temporarily softened, stimulating buying interest. Gold firms and retail investors competed to buy, and the price rose to a peak of 6,940 yuan. Before the close, it was suppressed again by many military bulls and retail investors who closed out their positions. As a result, it closed at 6,879 yuan, continuing to recover slightly by 81 yuan compared to the previous day. The trading volume was strong and clear throughout the day, with over 3,000 taels traded. Jewelry gold also fell by a small 10 yuan, and customs gold and other gold remained flat.</p>
<p>Spot Gold Falls Again by 81 Yuan</p>
<p>Since this morning, every bar (ten taels), the initial opening exchange rate reported a drop, and the U.S. dollar was tight, but it soon eased back, so it failed to stimulate people's hearts. On the contrary, there were quite a few who shouted to sell, and the market was pressed down by 40 yuan as soon as it opened. A gold firm did 20 taels, inferior to 6,920 yuan. Later, a certain money changer and a certain bank competed to sell, and the capital position became even more abundant, and it continued to fall by 40 yuan. A bank sold 10 taels of securities, at 6,880 yuan. Then, the number of sellers decreased, and securities and a certain bank saw it as low and bought in, and it rose by 30 yuan. Banks mutually did 50 taels, at 6,910 yuan. However, because the foreign exchange rate was still loose and flat, the selling wind rose again, and a certain bank sold again, and the trend went downward again. After retreating into the 6,900 yuan mark, the exchange market continued to harden, and gold firms and retail investors also sold, and the market became even more tired. A gold firm sold 10 taels to a bank, at 6,840 yuan. Near the close, the floating selling wind had subsided, and it was slightly recovered. A bank bought 20 taels from a gold firm, at 6,860 yuan as the noon closing price. At the noon trading hour, people's hearts were tired, and it fell by a small 20 yuan as soon as it opened. A gold firm sold 20 taels to a securities firm, at 6,840 yuan. Later, a bank sold, and it was seen to fall by a small 20 yuan. A money changer sold 10 taels to a securities firm, at 820 yuan. Later, the banks saw it was cheap and bought in, and the market turned stable. Unexpectedly, at this time, rumors spread that the German army had invaded the Netherlands, and the exchange market was slightly tight and soft. At one time, the buying wind expanded sharply, and gold firms competed to absorb it, and it rose by 120 yuan. Gold firms mutually did 10 taels, at 6,940 yuan. After entering, the number of buyers gradually decreased, and many retail investors took advantage of the high profits and sold, and it fell back. Moreover, the exchange market turned stable, and there were few people who entered, and it immediately retreated into the 6,900 yuan mark. Banks mutually did 30 taels, at 6,865 yuan. Near the close, gold firms slightly came to absorb, and it rose again by 14 yuan. Gold firms mutually did 20 taels, at 6,879 yuan as the evening closing price. As a result, it continued to fall by 81 yuan compared to the previous day. The entire day was up and down by 120 yuan. The selling price of the spot gold from the gold firms was several yuan higher than the spot gold, and the purchase price was reduced by 20 yuan. The current standard gold was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and both rarely traded.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Changed to Listing at 700 Yuan</p>
<p>The initial price of jewelry gold per tael sold by silver shops was still 710 yuan for Datonghang. Until 9:30, it was listed at 10 yuan lower. At 2:00 PM, it continued to drop by 5 yuan. At 2:45 PM, it rose back by 5 yuan. As a result, it was listed at 10 yuan lower. It is estimated that Datonghang changed to listing at 700 yuan. The new same-trades were the same as the above price, and the purchase was reduced by 20 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e86">Exchange Draft Discount Rate Drops Again <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's exchange draft discount rate fell even more sharply. For every 1,000 yuan, it fell from 150 yuan to 120 yuan in the morning, 125 yuan at noon, and the smallest was 115 yuan in the afternoon, and finally it was 120 yuan, 25 yuan lower than the previous day. The interest rate of the money-shop association remained unchanged, and it was listed at 2.5 cents in both the morning and noon markets.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Foreign Currency Falling Trend Intensifies <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw a smooth supply of British and American gold pounds due to the continued downward trend in gold prices. The market price of British gold notes fell due to the loosening trend of the black market British exchange rate. The price of American notes initially rose slightly to 21.20 yuan, and then gradually fell again. In the evening market, it retreated to 20.55 yuan, resulting in a fall of 45 cents compared to the previous day. Hong Kong notes still followed the downward trend of the Hong Kong-Shanghai exchange rate. French franc notes and Annam notes had balanced supply and demand, and the market price managed to stabilize. Dutch notes did not rise due to HSBC's reduced listing. Canadian notes and Philippine notes also showed a softening trend. The Japanese gold note showed a slightly rising trend, and the evening market was 1.28 yuan. The supply of Korean notes was slightly strong, and the evening market retreated to 1 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Securities - Wheelock Marden Stock - Fluctuations Quite Large - Domestic Prices Gradually Arousing Interest <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Securities gray market: Yesterday's market gradually trended firmer. Because gold prices retreated, foreign exchange was prolonged, and the premium greatly decreased, people's confidence was somewhat stabilized, and buyers felt a slight interest. The market was not short of new bulls and short-covering transactions, especially retail investors with 5,000 to 10,000 shares were enthusiastic. Most were speculative in nature, with temporary short-term transactions. Switching buying and selling was also quite active. In the morning, Hong Kong and United Coal Mines sold Ding and bought Bing shares. Jiu Fu and Song Mao took the opportunity to buy Ding shares. Le Mao and Hu He Ji bought in. Tong Ji had considerable supply and demand, and the market price was relatively stable. In the afternoon, Jiu Feng, Yi Chang, Xie Da, and Shun Kang successively sold out. Ding Kang, Lian He, Yong Feng, Tong Shun, and Lian Yi successively bought in. Demand exceeded supply, and the price rose slightly by twenty cents. As a result, the price consistently rose again by fifteen to thirty-five cents. The transaction volume was seven to eight hundred thousand yuan. A simple summary table is listed below:</p>
<p>Stock Trading: 30 shares of Bank of China were traded at a price of $72.00.</p>
<p>The overall stock market opened sluggish. Transactions were sparse in the first hour. Not until the last hour before noon did sentiment slightly improve, and trading volume increased accordingly. The afternoon market was more active, and the closing potential was also stable. Wheelock Marden had the largest fluctuations. Ex-rights shares traded from $116 to $123, and new rights shares from $84 to $89.50. The closing prices were $119 and $88, respectively. Shanghai Silver Company saw a slightly stimulating scene. The opening price was $37, and after opening, it continued to rise, reaching a new high of $41. The closing price was $39 bid. Its trading volume increased sharply from 7,000 shares the previous day to 29,000 shares. This was caused by rumors of a "very fat" dividend to be issued. International stocks were also affected, and the price was pushed to above $38, an increase of approximately $2 compared to the previous day. Jardine Matheson and Steel Corporation, on the contrary, continued to report downstream. The two stocks fell by the same amount as on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Rubber stocks, disregarding the recent rise in raw rubber prices worldwide, continued to soften. Although industrial stocks rebounded later, there was no response, which was truly an anomaly. The only reason was likely the tense situation near the German-Dutch border and the lack of faith of the Dutch in Nazi intentions. Generally nervous individuals also harbored suspicion and doubt about the future status of the Dutch East Indies. Considering the sharper drop in shares of rubber companies in Dutch Java, this speculation is likely not unfounded. As mentioned in the previous advertisement notice, the same stock market trading will continue until noon tomorrow (Friday). There will be no market in the afternoon. Trading will resume as usual on Monday morning. Although that day is a general bank holiday in England, it does not apply here.</p>
<p>London, 8th (Wednesday) dispatch: Today's listed prices of British company stocks in the Far East: HSBC shares rose one pound each, with a price of £92. Gulangsu Rubber shares rose three pence, with a price of 18 shillings and 6 pence. Security Insurance shares fell one pound, with a price of £28. The rest remained unchanged.</p>
<p>London, 8th (Wednesday) dispatch: Today's listed prices of Chinese foreign debt remained stable. There were no changes in any of the bonds up or down.</p>

<p>The yarn market continued to weaken. This was because there were few spot yarn transactions. Furthermore, after rising for many consecutive days, the market became sluggish, causing floating bulls to cut and close positions, and the market declined.</p>
<p>The spot yarn market opened flat in the morning. The price of 20-count Double Horse factory yarn was $1,610, down $30. Soon, it was heard that the foreign exchange rate had slightly contracted, and buyers were again enthusiastic, pushing the price up to $1,740. Afterwards, it was heard that the exchange rate had turned longer and spot sales were sluggish. Bulls closed positions, and market prices gradually weakened to $1,608. It was found that the total transaction volume during the day was 1,225 bales, and the price of 20-count Double Horse fell by $37. Today, 160 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Tianjin. The amount bought by each gang is listed as follows:</p>

<p>Another dispatch: Foreign cotton market prices: The New York cotton market was more active yesterday, with some transactions. Later, a small amount of short covering occurred. As a result, the closing price rose two points compared to the previous day. In India, because Far East transactions were light, yesterday's transportation forecast fell again by two rupees. Egyptian cotton rose 35 points.</p>
<p>There were many inquiries about foreign cotton transactions in Shanghai, but few transactions were completed. Only the Tianjin gang purchased, limited to spot transactions. Ultimately, due to the extraordinarily tight money market, transactions could not be greatly expanded. The cotton market prices yesterday, converted at a factory delivery price of $4.6875 per US dollar, are as follows:</p>
<p>20-count American Mitelin 377.50</p>

<h3 id="e91">Grains - Extremes Must Revert - Imported Rice Sales Booming Then Stagnating - Prices Have Sharply Fallen by Six Yuan <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>The rice market continued to decline. The prices of various imported rice fell by about one yuan. The lowest price of Small Sieve rice once reached $46, a sharp drop of six yuan from the peak of $52. People's confidence has also become stagnant. It is not easy for both buyers and sellers to be energized for a while, resulting in a situation of booming sales then stagnation. Moreover, the association is striving to crack down on short selling and buying, and has set a deadline for delivery. It has been decided that all transactions completed from today onwards must be cleared within five days. Speculators have suddenly lost their support and are eager to clear procedures, and their thoughts of trading have disappeared. Prices have fallen to facilitate sales, but actual sales are not smooth, and the goods are more than the demand. The market is becoming increasingly sluggish and declining all the way. Small Sieve rice fell directly to $46 in the mid-market, and even cheaper goods were available, selling for only $45.50, a sharp drop of about two yuan compared to the closing price of the previous market. Only then did the decline gradually slow down. There were quite a few people who were interested due to the low prices. Russian country customers also started to collect. The situation turned tense again, and the price rose by half a yuan. Small Sieve rice finally closed at $47. Other Saigon goods, etc., saw price reductions ranging from thirty to fifty cents. No. 1 Saigon was priced at $49.70 to $49.30, No. 2 at $47.50 to $46.50, No. 1 Siam at $48.50 to $48, No. 2 at $46.80 to $46, Fire Sieve at $48.50 to $48, Tokyo Pointed Tip at $46.50 to $46, Mixed Broken at $42.50 to $42, and Rice Mung at $44.50 to $44.</p>
<p>The arrival of thin and thick Japonica and other domestic rice was still low, at 1,300 to 1,400 bags. Off-market gray market rumors indicated that it was still weak and continued to fall by about half a yuan. Wuxi Pure Special Japonica was priced at $49, Powder Grain at $48, Chang Kun Japonica at $47 to $48, and Middle Decision at $46.50 to $46. Qing Si Special Thin Indica was priced at $49, Big Market at $47 to $48, and Decision at $46.50. Nan Gang Early and Late Indica were priced at $46 to $47.</p>
<p>Glutinous rice alone showed a stable situation yesterday. The selling price has been repeatedly reduced. Taking Broken Tip rice as an example, it still needs $41 to $42, while genuine grain domestic glutinous rice, except for high-quality goods that are still around $40, mid-market goods are only $37. The difference between the two goods is as much as $4 to $5. The cargo owners are even more concerned about their own capital and are unwilling to sell lightly again. At the same time, visiting customers also knew that the price was low and added purchases, so the resulting transaction volume was still high, and the situation was firmer than other goods.</p>
<p>The fall in imported rice prices was very severe in the early market. Spot prices for both high and low grades fell across the board. The opening was the weakest, smaller by one to two yuan compared to the previous morning, and also smaller by more than one yuan to fifty-seven cents compared to the previous evening. 2,800 tons of Siam rice have arrived in port on the Da Pu Wheel, so the opening prices for No. 2 Siam and Small Sieve rice have been reduced to $46. However, because the low price attracted actual sales, and there was also speculative scalping activity, the market price rose again. In the afternoon, the market was affected by the gold market, international news, and futures, and buying interest was even stronger. Small Sieve rice once rose to $48. Then, due to profit-taking, the closing price was $47.50, and it was less attractive to landlords. No. 2 Saigon's May upfront term had a cash squeeze pattern. After the opening price, it gradually rose from $49 to $60 at the afternoon close. Original pack small print also reached $58.40. Total spot trading volume for the day was more than 7,000 bags, and futures were more than 500 tons.</p>
<p>Another dispatch: It has recently been heard that a large amount of imported rice has arrived in Shanghai. Yesterday, Swire Company's Niuzhuang shipments brought 1,152 bags from Hong Kong. The Taiyuan Wheel also shipped 2,000 bags from Hong Kong. Furthermore, China Transportation Company's Da Pu Wheel directly shipped more than 26,000 bags from Saigon. The ship was scheduled to arrive in Shanghai at 1:00 PM yesterday, but it was not seen entering the port until the evening. It probably did not arrive last night and is expected to enter the port this morning. At that time, it will dock at the Gong He Xiang Wharf in Hongkou to unload onto the wharf (Zu).</p>
<h3 id="e92">Flour Transactions Unsatisfactory <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot flour transactions continued to be calm. Because sales to North and South customers lacked development, the shops on the street also saw sluggish retail sales in the city, and the intake decreased rather than increased. The return of old brand names was higher than the factory price by four to five cents in the previous two days, but yesterday it officially opened at $14.25. The asking prices for other domestic flour were still firm. The cargo owners mostly stood guard and waited for opportunities, so new transactions were even more quiet. The factory price for No. 2 flour was still $14. The amount directly sold by the factories was also less than 5,000 bags. Today, 16,000 bags were shipped to Tianjin, and 2,000 bags were shipped to Yantai. However, there was still no market for wheat.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Oil Cake - Raw Soybean Oil Hording Resurrected - Soybean Cake Sales to Outside Customers Not Weak <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Raw Oil: Yesterday, the Hong Kong gang purchased 6,000 cans of Jiangbei canned oil. The hoarding shops on the street also purchased 400 pieces of Jiaozhou oil, 60 barrels of Qingdao oil, and 500 cans of Yantai oil to start the market. In the afternoon, because selling to customers was not smooth, the price rose slightly.</p>
<p>Soybean Oil: The hoarding shops on the street took action to purchase, completing transactions for 250 barrels of Dalian oil, 40 barrels of Qingdao oil, 100 barrels of road goods, and 200 dan of Da You Yu factory oil.</p>
<p>Soybean Cake: Yesterday, the Shantou and Xinghua gangs, etc., completed transactions for six to seven thousand cakes of various brands.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Sugar Market - Red and White Sugar Showed Mixed Rise and Fall <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market trend: Coarse granulated sugar continued to loosen, while Carriage White sugar returned to favor. Spot price for 24 Coarse White sugar was $75.70 at this shop, small 60 cents, new goods at the outside shop were $75.40 to 20 cents, old goods were $75, calculated as small 80 cents, transfer shipment arriving on May 20 was $59.50. Taikoo B, Keswick shop, was $87, up 50 cents. HX Lou was $86.50, up $1.50. H Carriage Red new goods were $63. Spot Dutch Red goods were offered by the United Company, WA mark, 3,000 bags, $66, transfer goods were $55, calculated as small 50 cents. Spot sugar from this factory was $75.50, small 50 cents. Spot ice sugar from this factory was $90.50, Crystal Clear Ice Sugar was $92, all unchanged. The domestic sugar offered Hainan ocean, sixty-odd bags, priced at $73, to $69.50 and $67.</p>
<p>Also, yesterday (9th), 833 bags of sugar were transported from Haikou, also 2 bags from Guangzhou, 405 boxes and number 200 bags were transported from Hong Kong.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Metals - Flat Galvanized Iron Traded Over a Hundred Dan <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Since the contraction of foreign exchange, flat galvanized iron transactions, until yesterday's market, were sought after by the street's construction gang and factories, totaling seventy to eighty dan, and the Qingdao gang also amassed about thirty to forty dan. In addition, small amounts were sold to retail buyers in the shop. Therefore, people's confidence was still relatively stable, so the standard market price only fluctuated by a few cents compared to the previous market. Currently, the market price is $12.50 per sheet for 12 pounds, and $14.50 per sheet for 14 pounds. Wholesale purchases are slightly more competitive than before. It is found that there is no concern about an imbalance between supply and demand for shipments from factories on this street for the time being.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Shanghai Woolen Industry After the Second European War (Continued) <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Due to the outbreak and expansion of the Second European War, and the implementation of wartime administration by European and American countries, the authorities controlled activities such as wool and machinery, greatly restricting production. Furthermore, this long Eurasian sea route was frequently subject to destruction by enemy forces. Therefore, the distribution of wool in the Far East undoubtedly faced the greatest limitations. Although Shanghai's woolen companies could still receive sample orders from foreign manufacturers' representatives, these were mostly old samples from one or two years ago, and what was available was mostly existing stock (no new weaving required, just goods already in storage). As long as a telegram was sent, the goods could be loaded onto a ship. Truly new patterns that could be ordered and woven were very rare, and the arrival dates were uncertain. Due to weaving and transportation issues, orders could not be fulfilled as specified. Consequently, winter orders for items such as overcoat wool and thick fancy wool often arrived in early spring, while spring and summer goods like linen sometimes arrived in early winter.</p>
<p>It is now late spring, and summer woolens are already on the market, but the supply is extremely scarce. Items like "Fat Pique," linen blends, white drill, white linen, "Fan Er Ding," etc., as well as leftover stock from last year, are all highly prized. For example, English-made "Fan Er Ding," which sold for around fifteen or sixteen yuan last summer, is now wholesaling for around twenty-four yuan this spring, and it is difficult to find a complete range of colors. Linen is even more frighteningly expensive, rising from four or five yuan per yard last summer to around twelve yuan per full piece on the market this summer. Retail prices have increased by more than double, and the market still claims severe shortages. This situation is truly unprecedented. (Tang Yun)</p>

<h3 id="e97">Strange Incident at the Panyu County Office <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>A recent incident is recounted within the Panyu County Office in Guangzhou Prefecture: On the night of the 22nd day of the third month, at the hour of four, Prefect Feng of Panyu County awoke from a dream. In the distance, he heard a clamorous din from the street behind the office, startling him. Listening carefully, it seemed as if there were those frantically yelling and pursuing someone, while others were wailing and crying for help. The crowd numbered no less than a thousand. He hastily roused everyone, and all heard the same thing. Immediately, he ordered the guards and yamen runners to take up arms, light torches, and go to suppress the disturbance. Upon arriving, however, the moonlight was bright, the wind calm, and all was silent. When questioned, the watchmen and sentries claimed to know nothing. They returned to the office to report, and all suspected that they had experienced a ringing in the ears after a dream. They went back to sleep, but after sleeping, they heard the clamor again, even louder than before. They went to investigate again, but still found nothing. This happened repeatedly until dawn. The next day, rumors spread throughout Guangdong, and all found it strange!</p>
<h3 id="e98">Thief Taking a Sedan Chair <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>It is reported that the Zhejiang Shipping Bureau of this city was robbed of several hundred taels of silver notes last night. The cause of the theft was initially unknown. However, those in the upper rooms heard rustling sounds in the middle of the night. They immediately got up to check, but the chest was already empty. The family gathered to search, but there was no sign of the thief. However, they noticed a blue woolen sedan chair in the hall. They then remembered that someone had arrived in a sedan chair in the evening. They hadn't had time to check, and the thief must have sneaked in with it. The thief can be said to have had a brilliant idea. It is now reported that the county has been notified and requested to apprehend the thief, but whether the person and the loot can be recovered is unknown.</p>

<h3 id="e99">The "Poor Children's Class" of the Shanghai West Public Association <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Bi</p>
<p>Relief for Children Out of School, Tuition Extremely Low, Adoption of the "Little Teacher" System, Effectiveness Quite Significant</p>
<p>In the post-war isolated island, due to difficult living conditions, the education of children has also become a serious problem. Although general schools have established "Economic Classes" to provide learning opportunities for children from poor families who are eager to study, in reality, these "Economic Classes" are not truly "economic." Books and stationery all need to be paid for by the students themselves, causing many children to sigh in despair at the door!</p>
<p>Recently, I saw the "Poor Children's Class" of the Shanghai West Public Association, and I think their tuition is low, the burden on the students' families is not heavy, and those providing instruction are "little teachers," eliminating the need to hire other teachers. Therefore, I will introduce it as follows:</p>
<p>The "Poor Children's Class" of the Shanghai West Public Association is organized by the Youth Association of the Shanghai West Public Association. The class was established in the autumn of the 27th year of the Republic (1938). At that time, because the area near the Shanghai West Public Association (Robert Road, Big Ben) was a working-class area, the families were very poor, and there were many children out of school. The Association, with serving the people as its starting point, united several "voluntary instructors" (mostly young students) from the Youth Association and created this "Poor Children's Class."</p>
<p>Those entering the "Poor Children's Class" are almost all extremely poor children. Before the start of the school year, the parents submit an application form and must also fill out a family situation form. In this situation form, details about the residence, population, and especially the family's economic situation must be filled out carefully. After the Association interviews them and deems them qualified, they are notified that they are allowed to enroll. This is because they sincerely want to achieve the goal of "benefiting the common people."</p>
<p>Children who are allowed to enroll can pay a tuition fee of eight jiao or five jiao depending on their economic situation (a portion pays only two jiao or is completely exempted) and then enroll.</p>
<p>The "Poor Children's Class" currently has more than one hundred students, ranging in age from seven to fifteen or sixteen years old. The majority are around eleven years old. Classes are held every afternoon, and the subjects studied focus on three main areas: Chinese, arithmetic, and general knowledge. There is also citizenship training, with very simple and concise goals: (1) Diligence in study, (2) Politeness, (3) Neatness.</p>
<p>As for the class organization, they are currently divided into classes according to the students' age and level, using multi-grade teaching. Since the spring of the 28th year (1939), the "little teacher system" has also been adopted. There are currently eight little teachers, all outstanding children from the upper grades of the Workers' Children's Primary School established by the Association.</p>
<p>These little teachers can also ask the teachers who guide them for help with any difficult questions at any time. Every Thursday, the guiding teachers and little teachers hold a meeting together to exchange ideas.</p>
<p>Every Friday, the "Poor Children's Class" holds a weekly meeting. All the programs are also prepared and hosted by the little teachers. The little teachers must also give a simple speech to the students, at which time the guiding teacher will also attend to offer a few words of encouragement.</p>
<p>According to Mr. So-and-so, the person in charge, the students of the "Poor Children's Class" are very diligent in their studies, and almost everyone attends regularly. Also, the little teachers are better than "volunteer instructors." First, they are very persistent, and the students also trust them very much. Second, they can fully cooperate with the guiding teachers, so the results are very significant. The Association also gives the little teachers considerable encouragement, such as changing the little teachers to half-tuition students or free students; having a meal with the little teachers once or twice per semester; and leading them on tours of parks or to various places to visit.</p>
<p>I think the "Poor Children's Class" and "little teacher system" of the Shanghai West Public Association should be promoted everywhere so that it can gradually be developed and expanded. Gentlemen who are interested in serving society and benefiting the people may as well rise up quickly and try to implement it.</p>
<h3 id="e100">The Road to Getting Rich is Blocked <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>— Wei Si</p>
<p>A certain roadside advertisement once used this touching headline: "Life is very difficult, so one can only hope to get rich."</p>
<p>In today's Shanghai, who doesn't feel the difficulty of life? Naturally, there are very few exceptions. Who doesn't hope to relieve or lessen the burden of life? If one could strike it rich with a fortune in silver dollars, that would truly be a shortcut to overcoming difficulties.</p>
<p>So, people buy dog racing tickets, horse racing tickets, human racing tickets (jai alai), play lotteries, and frequent gambling dens. Why? To get rich and relieve the difficulties of life!</p>
<p>However, getting rich in this way, as the advertisement says, is merely a "hope." And truly achieving this hope is probably not much easier than ascending to the heavens, right? Therefore, the seeds sown time after time are like those scattered on a cement floor, destined not to sprout, let alone blossom and bear fruit.</p>
<p>Pitiful people who feel the hardship of life, harboring this difficult-to-realize hope, tighten their belts and squeeze out a little bit of money as the price for wanting to realize what, in fact, cannot be hoped for. One hope, one disappointment; another hope, another disappointment; continuing in this way, finally plunges that difficult life into an even deeper abyss of hardship.</p>
<p>It is understandable that people experiencing hardship in life want to get rich. But trying to achieve that goal through the various means mentioned above is merely a suicidal policy. To resolve the difficulties of life, please take a different path, this road is blocked!</p>
<h3 id="e101">A Suggestion for the YMCA Boys' Department <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>— Lin</p>
<p>"Not to be served, but to serve." This is said to be a motto engraved on a stone tablet at the base of the YMCA building. We know that the YMCA's purpose is also based on this, and in fact, the undertakings established by the YMCA have indeed achieved the goal of serving the community, which is something we greatly admire. For example, the establishment of the YMCA Boys' Department has benefited many poor students and resolved many of their personal problems, such as providing us with bathing facilities, reading materials, educational film screenings, swimming, various beneficial recreational activities, and setting up self-cultivation classes, etc. However, amidst all these benefits, small problems have arisen. It's not that our extravagant expectations are too great; it's that there are issues that actually need to be reasonably resolved. Therefore, we offer a portion of our suggestions to the YMCA Boys' Department and hope that they will be adopted.</p>
<p>(1) Bathing Issues - The Boys' Department's bathing facilities consist of four showerheads in such a small room, with so many people, and only open twice a week. Under these circumstances, it is really very difficult to get a clean body. Therefore, we request that the Boys' Department open another bathroom or open the existing one one or two more times each week, to avoid overcrowding.</p>
<p>(2) Self-Cultivation Classes - Self-cultivation classes are very beneficial to us, and although we have to pay a little money, we are also very willing to participate. Therefore, we hope that the Boys' Department can offer more classes such as "Journalism Class," "Drama Class," "Short-Hand Typing Class," "Excursion Class," and so on.</p>
<p>These few suggestions come from our hearts, and we hope that the YMCA Boys' Department, which serves the people, can adopt them as much as possible.</p>

<p>Poor person: Why does the money of the rich keep accumulating, while the money of the poor keeps dwindling?</p>
<p>Zoologist: Perhaps money also has a kind of herding instinct, so small amounts of money tend to go towards large money groups.</p>

<p>Chapter 23: Old Friends and New Companions, Literature is Valuable; Famous Scenic Spots, Well-Managed People</p>
<p>Besides Mrs. Su Ya, who is middle-aged, everyone present today is young and full of vigor. Even Mrs. Su Ya, although she is a foreign old woman, is very willing to associate with Chinese youths, laughing and talking just like them. At the table, Lin Jiancheng and Engineer Xue discussed the recent developments of the Taihu Cement Company. Engineer Xue said, "Our business is linked to your construction business. The more developed the construction industry, the greater the demand for cement. Recently, China's reconstruction efforts have progressed very rapidly. In addition to building houses, there are also bridges, roads, and all kinds of projects being carried out simultaneously. This almost makes our factory's output somewhat insufficient. We must purchase more machines and build more buildings. Now we have also newly established two brick and tile factories, one in Changzhou, which specializes in making blue bricks, and one in Yixing, which specializes in making red bricks. The products are quite good, and we want to make good quality items at low prices. Mr. Jiancheng, please try using our materials in your construction projects; we would be grateful." Lin Jiancheng said, "Of course! We use domestic products for construction materials whenever the quality is good and the price is reasonable. Besides, we are old friends, and we know that the products under your management and command are of course the most reliable. Just take the lumber we use for construction. In the past, for any large construction projects in Shanghai, foreign lumber was used. Wouldn't that be a laughingstock? There are vast forests everywhere within China's borders. People often get lost in the forests, walking for days and nights. Are we lacking lumber? It's just that transportation is inconvenient, and the lumber cannot be transported out, so there's no way. After China's rejuvenation, transportation will gradually develop everywhere, and lumber can be transported out of the mountains and forests. And the lumber companies in various provinces are also emerging like mushrooms. It's truly 'timber in inexhaustible supply,' so why would we still use foreign lumber?" Yu Danyun then introduced the two Miss He's, saying, "These two Miss He's are textile experts. They are about to open a relatively large silk weaving factory in Suzhou's Free Village, and they will soon be building factory buildings. That will require quite a bit of cement bricks and tiles from your factory. I will introduce these two customers to Mr. Xue first." Engineer Xue said, "Thank you, thank you! If you favor us, we will definitely provide special service." At that time, Jin Danyun and Mrs. Xue also found each other very congenial, and she introduced to the two Miss He's, "Speaking of running factories, this Mrs. Xue is also an old hand at factories." Mrs. Xue smiled, "Oh dear! I'm just playing around, how could I have the ability to run a factory?" It turned out that Mrs. Xue runs a factory, a toy factory, specializing in making toys for children. (End of Chapter 74)</p>

<h3 id="e104">Don Ameche on How to Educate Children <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>— Ms. Sha Wei</p>
<p>Don Ameche is now a very experienced father. He once gave a speech on "How to teach his children in this world of declining morals." A rough account of it is described below:</p>
<p>Six Years of Fatherhood Experience, How to Punish and Teach?</p>
<p>On July 20, 1939, I – Don himself – became the father of a third child, like the previous two, a boy. This completely disappointed me and Donny – Don's eldest son – because we hoped to have a girl.</p>
<p>Now I have six years of experience as a father, and I know how to nurture a child and guide him onto the path of health. At the same time, I also have a good lesson for children, which I learned from my mother. In the past, my mother was always very strict with me and my sisters. At that time, although I often resented it, now I am grateful. My success today depends on the strict training I received at that time.</p>
<p>So now I am the same way with my children. If any of them commits a mistake, we all sit down together to study the severity of the mistake and give them punishment and teaching accordingly. For example, once my second child, Ronnie, hurt the newborn baby because he was jealous. We ignored him until he also loved his newborn brother.</p>
<p>Cultivate a Sound Personality, Suitable for One's Own Individuality.</p>
<p>Raising those children is a very interesting thing. Be mindful of those children, and try to help them build their own personalities; but that is not something you force them to develop, but rather their own excellent qualities. So some people say: in the current terrible trend, it is necessary to cultivate them into the qualities they think are necessary. I think that is wrong, because every child has his own inevitable qualities.</p>
<p>I feel that I am the happiest person now. I have the work I love to do, and at the same time I have a happy family. Although there is a war in Europe now, it has nothing to do with me, and this kind of world is exactly what I need. In this chaotic era, my children will be able to become young people with great personalities.</p>
<p>They are now studying at Catholic School, and I know that church schools can give them better education. At the same time, I also want them to go to church universities in the future. Unless they have special reasons, they must go to these universities.</p>
<p>Hope the Children Have a Real and Great Personality.</p>
<p>There is one thing that my children will never enjoy, and that is that I will never use a servant to pick them up, or have a dedicated car. This will cultivate their wasteful habits.</p>
<p>I don't want my children to be soldiers in the future. I am afraid of war, and I hate all the evil consequences caused by war. But if the motherland needs them, I believe they will fulfill their responsibilities. But I want to pray to God that this kind of thing will not happen. Speaking of prayer, my Donny and Ronnie, they have developed the habit of praying since they were very young, because only prayer can bring peace of mind and body. We may have more children in the future, but no matter what, I finally hope that they will all have a real and great personality in the future.</p>

<p>— Xing</p>
<p>Chen Yunshang has decided to take the President Coolidge to Shanghai and will arrive tomorrow (11th) afternoon. Bu Wancang's "Su Wu Herding Sheep" is all prepared, and filming can begin after Chen arrives in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Wang Yin returned to Shanghai yesterday, and the Nanyue master Zhu Qingxian and Xinhua distribution director Li Dashen also came together. Wang talked... plans to return to Hong Kong at the end of this month to begin work on "Yang Guifei."</p>
<h3 id="e106">Zhou Jianyun Rebuilds, Emphasizing Overseas Distribution Routes <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>— Haixing</p>
<p>The reporter had previously reported on the news that Zhou Jianyun, a veteran of the Chinese film industry, had founded a production company. According to Liu Zhonghao, the owner of Guohua, the name of Zhou's company has been finalized as "Jingxing Film Company" and will rent a studio from Guohua for use. Guohua's two newly built studios will be completed within this month, and Jingxing Company's work can begin in early next month. As for Guotai, it is a sister company of Guohua, and its products are all distributed by Renyong Trading Company, similar to how the Xinhua, Huaxin, and Huacheng three factories belong to China United Film Company. Liu also told reporters: "What I know about Jingxing Company is only this much. As for the actors, directors, etc., I still don't know, but Mr. Jianyun will talk to you in the next two or three days about the detailed content of Jingxing, because people in the society are quite concerned about Zhou's activities." According to the reporter, Zhou's distribution policy will focus exclusively on overseas and Chongqing, Hong Kong, and Shanghai, and abandon some other markets.</p>

<p>— Hai</p>
<p>Jin Suwen, Hu Tiwei, Sang Hu, and others have organized the Lone Eagle Drama Troupe. For their first performance, they have chosen the Parasitic Grass mainly written by Hong Shen. The troupe welcomes comrades to join and consolidate the lineup. Female lead Li Xuefang has already signed up to join and will play the role of the female teacher in the play. She has been diligently studying the script recently and is very interested.</p>
<p>Mao Jianqiu and Wang Chunbai fell in love and are pregnant and waiting to give birth, so they resigned from the Gongwutai troupe and decided to leave after tonight's performance. She will rest in Shanghai for a while and then go to Hankou to serve her father. Bai Sulian, the new actor invited by Gongwutai, will debut tomorrow night, playing the role of Luo Xiulian in "Six Editions of Ji Gong the Living Buddha."</p>
<p>Ma Jinfeng, Liang Jueshan, and other actors who resigned from the Carlton Yifeng Drama Club are still helping out in the club after the expiration of their contracts. Now that the club has invited a new actor, they will all officially cease performing starting yesterday.</p>
<p>Huang Guiqiu, Yan Shishan, and Gu Yulan will perform the three famous dramas "Butterfly Matchmaker," "Xiangjiang Meeting," and "A Bolt of Cloth" on the 13th, specially requested by Chen Yilong Taishi. He also reserved 45 seats. This old man rarely listens to opera, so Guiqiu and others consider it a special honor.</p>
<p>Public Music</p>
<p>The Nanjing Road Advanced Vocational Evening School and Advanced Study Library will hold a public high-class music appreciation concert tomorrow night (Saturday) starting at 7:30 pm. The program includes saw music, famous song singing, harmonica performance, Huqin solo, etc. People from all walks of life are welcome to come and enjoy it. Admission tickets are available.</p>
<p>Mr. Si Yigui, a famous singer on the sea, and Mr. Ye Huaide, a famous flutist, plan to hold a joint ancient music concert at the American Women's Association on Jing'an Temple Road on May 19. The two gentlemen are leaders in the music scene with profound attainments. This performance will definitely add a unique brilliance to the music scene on the sea.</p>
<p>Longevity Teapot Opera Talk</p>
<h3 id="e108">A Brief Review of Cheng Yanqiu's First Performance of "Locking the Lin Purse" (Part 1) <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>— Su Shaoqing</p>
<p>Cheng Yanqiu's golden performance this time has unprecedented appeal. Every day is fully seated, and it is quite difficult to get a ticket. Those who missed out must be in the minority. I am also one of those who missed out. Yanqiu is modest and values friendship extremely. Whenever he comes to Shanghai, he always comes over to talk to me. Last month, on the —th day, he came to my house with a light car and simple entourage. After exchanging pleasantries, he said that he would perform a newly written play called "Locking the Lin Purse," with extremely demanding singing and many new tunes. There is a "crying head" added to the Er Liu Ban, which is an "original board," the same as "singing San," which is still novel. He and Mr. Wang Yaoqing researched it together, and it may be a refreshing change. When I heard this, I really wanted to hear what it was all about. If I were in Beiping, Mr. Cheng Yushuang would definitely give me a ticket at that time, but in Shanghai, the ticket price is more than four yuan, so even if I were given a ticket, it would be difficult to accept. Half a month later, this play was posted and performed. It happened that Mr. Xia pre-purchased a ticket. I went there at 8:30. Wang Shaolou's Hongyangdong Sixth Son was about to return to the great hall. I only heard a sentence "Impermanence arrives and all things end..." According to Mr. Xia, his voice was not good. After a ten-minute break, "Locking the Lin Purse" came on stage, and the audience's spirits were refreshed. I also paid special attention. Now I will make a brief review of the script and Mr. Cheng's particularly excellent and weak points in singing and acting. The plot of the story has already been introduced in this publication, so I will not repeat it.</p>
<p>Advantage 1: This play can break away from the cliches in the first scene, using servants and maids to repeatedly exchange dowry items and the Lin purse, first vaguely writing about the pride of the heroine Xue Xiangling, and then the heroine begins to appear on stage, and then actually writing about her pretentious and arrogant state. The original intention was to narrate that Miss Xue was getting married soon, and there was no old-fashioned matchmaking, betrothal ceremony, etc. This aspect is commendable.</p>
<p>Advantage 2: The scene of the sedan chair sheltering from the rain and meeting the poor bride Zhao Shouzhen and giving the Lin purse writes about the different situations of the rich and the poor. While singing, she also inserts white. The arrogance of the Xue family's maid is overwhelming, and the poverty and boredom of the Zhao family's old father are in stark contrast. The singing uses two kinds of Er Liu and Liushui, and it is also concise. This scene is extremely good.</p>
