<h3>內外交迫暴露無能　阿部內閣卒告傾覆　米內光政奉命組織新閣　海相吉田留任外相有田</h3>
<p>東京　阿部内閣今晨九時十三分開臨時閣議、决定總辭職、阿部首相即於九時四十五分進宮呈遞全體閣員之辭職書、（十四日同盟社電）</p>
<p>香港　東京電、軍事參議官前海相米内光政、今日下午七時十五分奉召入宫、奉日皇勒諭組織新閣、米内奉答、請假以時間籌組新閣、卽行退出、先是今日下午六時四十分、內府大臣湯淺入宮覲見日皇、當卽推薦米内組閣、日皇乃召米内入宮、降組閣大命、陸相畑後六亦於下午七時五十五分入宮覲見日皇(十四日電）</p>
<p>東京　拜命組後機內閣之米内大將、本日下午八時零五分由宮中推退、即赴首相官邸着手準備組閣、同時並要求　大將野村海軍大將、及前藏相石渡莊太郎等參集官邸、（十四日同盟電）</p>
<p>東京　元厚相廣瀨久忠今日下午九時四十分加入組閣本部、（十四日同盟電）</p>
<p>東京　新內閣之外務大臣由有田八郎就任、吉田海相任原職、又前任藏相石渡莊太郎、決定任內閣書記官長、（十四日同盟電）</p>
<p>東京　新内閣之藏相、以現任日本銀行總裁結城豐太郎呼聲最高、(十四日同盟社電）</p>
<p>近衛堅辭退求其次</p>
<p>東京　湯淺內府負有奏請日皇任命繼任首相之重責、故徵各方面意見、仟近衛文　爲第　候選人、極力請求近衛出馬收拾時局、然近衛心境仍然無變化、以致銓衛繼任首相人選工作不得不考慮第二步驟、（十四日同盟社電）</p>
<p>東京　湯淺內府今晨十一時在宮中參集重臣、探詢各人意向、結果決定推舉軍事參議員海軍大將米內光政出馬組閣、並派內臣大府松平秘書官長搭乘當日下午二时廿三分由東京出發之火車赴興津、訪問西園寺、傳達湯淺內府之意向、並徵求公爵意見後、以電話報告內府、由是湯淺內府即於六時四十分進宮晋謁天皇拜奏決認米內大將最適任担當後繼內閣首腦（十四日同盟）</p>
<p>阿部聲明辭職理由</p>
<p>東京　今晨阿部向新聞記者發表談片如下、「余自去年八月間組閣以來、勉力辦理內外國務、而以處理中國事件爲主要目標、惟關於實施政府已定政策與計劃之意見不獲一致、今已顯然、故余已向天皇遞呈內閣總辭職表、以期在此緊急時期避除政府之停頓、而免使已入第一階段的中國事件之處理、發生可能的反響」、（十四日路透電）</p>
<p>新閣政治動向推測</p>
<p>東京　米內大將忽膺組閣之命、殊出一般人之意表、米內曾在平沼驥一郎及近衛文　爲首相時、入閣爲海軍大臣、查阿部信行之內閣中、海軍部已有三人入閣、聲勢頗大、而今不以陸相畑後六組閣、竟由米內膺首相之選、則新聞在政治上之動向、不難預測一二、東京人士指陳、日本海軍方面企圖與英美覓取諒解、對美國尤爲注意、又稱今晨日本報章尚未提及米內爲繼任首相之人選之一、此點似亦具有意義、（十四日海通電）</p>
<p>東京　據今晚消息、日皇已任命海軍大將米內光政、組織繼任內閣、前傳畑後六大將奉命組閣之說、已證明不確、阿部內閣繼近衛平沼之後、負起繼續增強半全能國家戰事經濟之重責、因各閣員之毫無建樹及處置失當、致各階級人士、包括資本家·實業家·官僚·政客及民眾日趨不滿、阿部內閣遂在眾院大多數議員宣告反對之下、被迫辭職、蓋阿部內閣如以解散國會之手段、壓迫反對派、則一百萬萬元重大預算案之通過、顯將因子延遲、且有許多暗示、大選之結果、眾院中反對內閣之強烈、更將逾於現時也、日本全國現在屬望有一強有力之超特政治家、能出而更正以前三任內閣之錯誤、（十四日路透電）</p>
<p>渝方觀察日本政局</p>
<p>重慶　據華方熟悉日本政情者稱、繼阿部內閣而起之日本新內閣、必爲一軍閥之統治、其權利之大、必較已辭職之官僚統治爲大、蓋日本之阿部內閣、爲日本戰時內閣中最脆弱而無用之內閣、新內閣之色彩、必更趨於少壯軍人之方面、故其對華軍事行動亦必更趨於積極、阿部內閣之弱點即在無能、阿部內閣中雖不乏如何部與野村等輩之「美國通」、但日美關係則始終未能改進、唯有坐待美日商約之满期、同時阿部內閣亦未能促進蘇日間關係、實則自歐戰爆發之後、因蘇德友誼之增進、本有改進蘇日關係好機會、但阿部對於此項機會則竟失之交臂、再則阿部對「中國事件」亦未能解決、對於汪精衛「統治」亦無早日樹立之能力、阿部內閣僅有之成績、即爲蘇日漁業協定之訂立、但就大體言、此一協定純爲技術性之協定、並不十分重要者、在國內方面、阿部所遭遇之最大難關有二、（一）日本大小城市中之鬧米風潮、即顯示日本在經濟上之困難、（二）外務省官員之集團辭職、已將阿部內閣之尊嚴摧毀殆盡、最後日本新起之政府必更爲强有力之軍閥統治、但假若日本對華之軍事行動愈趨於積極、則中國之對日抗戰亦必愈堅强也、（十四日合眾社電）</p>
<h3>米內略歷</h3>
<p>東京　米內新首相現年六十歲、宕手縣任、明治三十四年畢業海軍兵學校、後任海軍少尉、以後累進、至昭和五年昇任海軍中將、其間曾任「春日」「盤手」「扶桑」「陸奧」等各軍艦艦長?第二艦隊參謀長.鎮海要港部司令長官?第一遣外艦隊司令官.軍令部出仕?第三艦隊司令長官?佐世保鎮守府司令長官.聯合艦隊司令長官等要職、而於昭和十二年林內閣成立時就任海相、其後轉任軍事參議官而至今日、（十四日同盟電）</p>
<h3>日各界對新閣　期望甚殷　樹立國內秩序　認爲急切要圖</h3>
<p>東京　今晨各報咸主張組織强有力之內閣、不但受朝廷之信任、且須具有人民之擁戴、多數報章力陳新閣須以內政爲急務、關於農工之事務尤須致力、欲作長期戰爭、非如此不可、「朝日新聞」稱、新閣應首先樹立國內之秩序、否則滿清國外政局之任何企圖、均不免失敗云、（十四日海通電）</p>
<p>東京　日本產業界對於米內內閣之出現、給予好感已達極點、所成問題者、即關於担當大藏.商工兩項以何許人物入閣也、惟設如依照米內大將之性格及其幕後之力量推察之、則政策定必相當穩健、故各方對此際協力政黨處理對外問題、及後方收拾處理上之協助新閣意向、甚爲激昂、茲綜合財界方面對米內內閣之希望臚列於下（一）對於恢復由前內閣喪失之政治威信者乃先解決問題、（二）以責任善處關於物價問題物資問題等國內經濟統制、（三）關於對外問題、其中尤以貿易政策上、務必尊重民間當業者之充分意見、以資圓滑其運行、（十四日同盟電）</p>
<h3>秉政四閒月　阿部政績之檢討</h3>
<p>日本首相平昭騏一郎、因標榜强化反共產國際公約之政策、故於希特勒背棄日本與蘇聯接近之後、不安於位、阿部大將乃於去歲八月卅日登台、膺任首相、其時爲標蘇兩國締結協定之後一星期、又越二日而歐戰爆發、阿部大將初無籍籍名、退伍已歷三年之久、一般人遂以爲渠息影林泉若是其久、既無恩怨、必鮮政敵、其組閣當不致引起多大異議、加之軍部亦予擁護、渠又與近衛公爵之親信木戶侯爵爲兒女親家、（其長子娶侯爵之女）凡此種種、均爲當時組閣之良好條件、此阿部大將出任首揆之經過情形也、</p>
<p>秉政伊始　唯一成績</p>
<p>渠秉政伊始、以首相暫兼外相、即於九月五日發出不參加歐戰之聲明、嗣於同月十六日與蘇聯成立諾蒙亨林休戰協定、凡此均爲日本輿論所樂聞、特以諾蒙亨林事件而論、日蘇兩軍迭次接觸結果、日本士兵陣亡共一萬八千名之多、此則日本政府俟至十月四日始乃發表公報予以宣佈耳、</p>
<p>軍事失敗　重大打擊</p>
<p>阿部首相嗣於十月二十三日任命野村海軍大將爲外相、以充實內閣之陣容、並即在三方面採取「攻勢」、爲對華軍事上的攻勢、日軍開始攻擊長沙、但迄未攻入、厥後日軍方面解釋謂並無此意、僅以「膺懲」華軍爲事、二爲對國內的攻勢、阿部首相鑒於陸海兩相有權隨時直接覲見天皇、奏對內閣各項政事、此層足使陸海兩相在內閣中、得與首相相抗衡、爰曾設法改革、停止此項權利、但結果如何未經發表、聞僅限於有關「中國事變」之處置問題加以限制、關於其他各種公務、則陸海兩相仍得隨時入宮覲對、三爲對官僚政治之攻勢、阿部首相不顧外務省之反對、圖謀添設商務省、遂致外務省全體官吏　起反對、而以「外交怠工」相抵制、歷數日之久、至十月十三日、阿部內閣卒告屈服、其軟弱無能、由是暴露無餘、阿部內閣在上述三種攻勢之中、迭遭失敗以後、即改取守勢、但種種打擊接種而來、</p>
<p>外交內政　毫無建樹</p>
<p>美國駐日大使格魯於去歲十月十九日再東京美僑俱樂部發表演說、警告日本、謂美國輿論所期待者、「乃事實而非空言」、此實阿部內閣所受之第一次打擊、厥後政友民政兩大政黨黨魁於十一月二十一日拒絕入閣、此乃第二次打擊、但一般人以爲政局惡化之主要原因、實爲國內經濟之不安、例如日本若干地方食米匱乏、北部諸地以及九州區與朝鮮各處、甚至謠傳業已發生搶米風潮、此外、日人家庭日用必需之木炭亦感竭　、據聞米炭兩宗物品之不敷應用、幷非根本上接濟之不足、實因分配不均所致、影響所及、米價飛漲、一般人民大爲震動、對於內閣努力抑平各種必需品價格一項政策、莫不認爲業已失敗、蓋以內閣最初原以抑低物價爲標榜、旋以無法抑低改爲將物價依照現行水準使之穩定、但最後則又無法穩定而改爲依照「公允水準」重訂物價、加之去歲十二月八日所通過之預算案、其總數竟在一百萬萬日元以上、實爲空前未有之龐大預算、預料政府爲應付此項巨大支出起見、勢必提高稅率、幷賡續趨向通貨膨脹政策、</p>
<p>圖挽頹勢　終鮮成效</p>
<p>迨至十二月二十六日眾院復會、各黨議員二百餘人竟在非正式會中通過決議案、要求阿部辭職、日本政黨自最近十年來、在國家政治生活中雖已不復居於決定的地位、但各該議員此種舉動、足以證明一般人民對於阿部內閣之軟弱無能、實已日益不滿、阿部內閣在此種空氣之下、雖圖在外交上出以最後掙扎、以期挽回頹勢、但終鮮成效、例如去歲十二月三十一日、日本政府就漁業問題與蘇聯成立臨時協定、藉以表示日蘇兩國正在調整邦交、此其一、日本政府宣佈開放長江下游、以安慰美國輿論、幷爲雙方改善關係之圖闢一蹊徑、此其二、但結果國內政治緊張局勢、幷未因此趨於緩和、更以軍事而言、日軍雖在數星期前攻陷中國廣西省南甯城、但對於穩固內閣地位一層、依然無何裨補、</p>
<p>降至獻歲之後、政府當局又與駐華日軍代表舉行會議、（派遣軍總參謀長板垣中將亦自中國飛返東京、參加其事）就「汪精衛新政權」問題、有所討論、詎意此項初步談判完成之後、陸相畑俊六大將亦即軍部之代言人、竟公開表示軍部方面切望首相辭職、阿部內閣因此終以傾覆聞矣、（哈瓦斯社）</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>阿部下野與日本政治</h3>
<p>日本阿部內閣卒不復能維持而於昨日上午實行總辭職矣。繼任首相難乎其選　，迄昨日深夜，始悉前海軍大臣米內奉命組織內閣，新閣能否告成，閣員是何陣容，政策取何傾響，舉未可知也。溯自中國發動全抗戰以來，日本旣四易其首相；近衛內閣歷時較久，計閱十九月；平沼內閣甚暫，計閱八月；阿部內閣成立於去歲八月卅日，在任僅四閱月又半，閣運短促之極。</p>
<p>近衛閣倒，以對華和平攻勢之失敗爲因；平沼閣倒，以強化德義日反共公約而竟爲德國所賣，爲之主因；至於阿部，則近乎恍惚離奇。猶憶阿部登臺之始，吾人嘗就其所流露之端倪，論其本質，稱之爲「空前之貧弱空虛」；論其希望，斷之爲「具見先天不足，後天失調，其不能有爲，絕無前途，可謂呱呱墜地而即已注定其運命」；及今檢視，竊幸前論之微中。蓋日本對中國之軍事，對國際之外交，對國內之經濟，阿部一無成就，一無辦法；抑以日本今日之一切，比較四五月以前之一般情況，雖謂無一而非每況愈下，亦無不可。雖然，亦有未可一筆抹煞者：當平沼內閣時代，日本方大吹大擂於結合德義，挾制英法，及德國交歡蘇聯，日本在國際驟陷於孤立；阿部承其後，不足二旬而蘇日之諾蒙享休戰協定簽訂於前，及近頃而蘇日漁業問題妥協於後；此則平沼所未能爲，阿部努力得之者也。夫以日本在四五月來之國際環境言之，德國大舉侵略波蘭，英法爲援波制德而宣戰，蘇聯決心有爲於北歐，舉世擾攘，美國矜持；此誠日本幡然改圖，自拔於泥淖，取償於貿易，恢復其國際地位之絕好環境也；顧乃一籌莫展，卒如今日，謂非負有國家之重任者，重負國家之倚畀所致歟；對蘇聯之邊界糾紛與漁業問題，事之至小，謂阿部得之，尤毌寗謂蘇聯予之之爲尤當。</p>
<p>阿部內部以先天後天之貧弱空虛而不克久於其位，自在意中；然正瓦解於此際，則非事理之常。何以言之?若瓦解而爲應付一般國際，則阿部組閣纔兩日而歐戰遽作，此爲阿部奉命之時所不及料，當時若爲適應劇變而改組，是異數而非異事也。若瓦解而爲應付美日對立，則阿部組閣以迄商約失效，共知其間實有五月之距離，急謀挽救，儘爲時間所容許；今距失效之日僅一旬，此在具有堅定國策之國家政家，正是鄭重將事之重要瞬息也；謂此爲阿部所不勝，何因循至末日？若瓦解而爲應付日本所謂「中國事變」此在日本樹立所謂新中央，其政策之本質茲不遑多論，然日本旣號稱此爲一成不變之政策矣，則何以於此決定「條件」之後，不數日而去首相。總之，阿部內閣雖曰自始無甚前途之內閣，然倒於今茲，抑且倒之而莫知其主因，此類閣潮，爲世界各國與日本政史上所不經覯也。</p>
<p>試檢阿部內閣之臨終談話，有語曰「余以處理中國事變爲主要目標，惟關於實施政府已定政策與計畫之意見，不獲一致，今已顯然，」故已辭職，以免發生可能影響云；於是不妨推想阿部內閣之瓦解，僅爲處理所謂中國事變方針下之技術問題，雖然，可信乎？阿部之「處理中國事變方針，」以近衛宣言爲張本者也；阿部所不勝，其惟近衛勝之；而阿部之將倒未倒也，日本軍政朝野各方所一致推重者，又惟近衛；然則近衛有其義不容辭者矣！顧乃近衛之所以遜謝者，有語曰「自審經濟智識不足濟事，良知役使，未容擔當收拾時局之重任；且今後政局，非恃門第不一致；」如是云云，可知非關推進對華方針之技術問題，抑亦不祇對華方針對問題而已。問題在經濟，是近似矣；然議員二百六十人根據身經目擊之各地民間疾苦以壓迫阿部，而阿部夷然不爲所動，終於不得不去者乃因陸相畑俊六之一言；繼阿部者，非經濟界權威，乃爲海軍大將米內；然則經濟固猶非主題，詎然可見？</p>
<p>由上述種種，故曰阿部之倒，恍惚離奇。抑亦何奇？事不自量，貿然黷武侵略兩年半，遂至力窮，財竭，兵疲，民怨；明知無以爲繼，明知必須根本改變國策；顧乃誤於夙昔誇誕之教育，誤於歷年虛妄之宣傳，使下層軍民誤入歧途，積重難返；却無一大知大勇之政治家，敢任一時之怨，力矯侵略之非；　　重員，皆僅掙扎於軍事外交經濟之末路之中；其徬徨，其悲哀，豈異數哉！</p>

<h3>法海長陳述　協約國海上戰績　商業獲得自由　使德海外貿易銷滅於無形　德警告中立船勿受英護送</h3>
<p>巴黎　法海軍部長甘賓基、昨發表一文、陳述開戰後四個月內、協約國在海上之驚人成績、謂協約國已爲其商業獲得自由、而使德國海外貿易銷滅於無形、並使德船四百艘不敢駛出中立口岸、僅法國海軍、已擊沉德潛艇十艘、檢查商船二百三十九艘、截留運往德國之貨物六十二萬二千噸、除波羅的海外、協約國航路完全如常開放、大軍來自殖民地、未嘗折失一人、出法國軍艦護送而安然過海者、計有協約國船只一千三百餘艘、與商航隊二百餘起、協約國共擊沉德潛艇約三十艘、法國軍艦毫無損失、法國商船共喪十一艘、其中七艘爲德潛艇轟沉、按損失之數、約合九月間法國所有商船總數百分之二、法國船廠現正積極建造軍艦一百二十六艘、（十四日路透社電）</p>

<p>柏林　德外部喉舌「德意志外交政治評論報」、今日著文警告中立船只謂、倘中立船只受英國宣傳、由英國兵艦護送、則將自動變爲參戰單位、有遭遇戰事危險之可能、此乃英國欲使中立國捲入歐戰之詭計、望各中立國愼勿墮其術中、（十三日海通社電）</p>
<h3>日對外貿易　畸形發展　對「非日金集團」　仍居於入超地位</h3>
<p>東京　據官方在數日前所發表之統計、去年度日本對外貿易增加甚鉅、共總數共達七十萬萬零六千萬日圓、計較前年增加百分之二十三、其中進口部份、較前年增加百分之十、出口部份增加百分之三十六、出超總數共爲八萬萬日圓、以視前年出超、增加七萬萬四千萬日圓之多、但據各專家談稱、出超額雖大、實際上并非全部可以換得外幣、蓋以日本對外貿易之對象、須分爲兩個不同之集團、一爲「日金集團」、包括「滿洲國」與中國淪陷區域在內、一爲「非日金集團」、日本與「非日金集團」各國之貿易、始可稱之爲「眞正的國外貿易」、倘就去年日本整個貿易狀況加以分析、其大部份進口貨物均係來自此等國家、至日本出口貨物之輸往各該國家者、則約佔總數一半以上、質言之、日本對於「非日金集團」各國、實際上約入超五萬萬日圓、於以見日本在整個貿易上雖屬出超、但對上「非日金集團」各國仍居于入超地位、其不能盡量以出口貨物換取外幣、自屬可想而知、抑去年日本對外貿易之所由激增、其主要原因、厥爲全世界物價高漲、往往某種貨物之貿易數量、并未增加、但因物價飛漲之故、其總値竟較前激增、例如去年日絲輸出數額、從量的方面計算、則反而增加百分之二十、日本輸入粗棉之情形亦復如是、此外、日本政府在國內嚴格統制經濟、對于改善貿易均衡一層、頗有成效、則以政府曾竭力限制本國消費、俾以更多之貨物輸出國外故也云、（十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>華盛頓航訊　商務部頃宣佈、日本制製造人造絲所用織維、均賴斯堪的那維亞半島各國供給、近因歐洲戰爭之故、乃改向美國購買、並聞日本人造絲業已獲得政府之同意、擬向美國及加拿大聯邦訂購三萬噸、日本經濟因受歐戰影響、依賴美國日深、可於此獲一明證、（哈瓦斯社）</p>
<h3>美國民衆　反日情緒強烈　美日商務談判無法進行　此後將入於無條約狀態</h3>

<h3>美在關島　設防案　將提出衆院討論</h3>

<h3>美遠東政策的透視</h3>
<p>自去年九月蘇聯與日本簽訂停戰協定，蘇聯外交委員長莫洛托夫接着在十月革命紀念演說表示對日親善之後，日蘇即可進行商務談判之說，甚囂塵上，美國對於遠東局勢因乃愈加關切，一般關心人士從而爭相詢問，遠東方面的世仇日蘇兩國是否將如德蘇兩國沆瀣一氣，瓜分中國，果爾則門戶開放政策與美國傳統的權益又將何如。</p>
<p>美國政府至少已明白宣佈，對於在華任何權益，決不坦然的自動的予以放棄。美國雖不致爲着這些權益作戰，但在「戰爭之外」儘有其他方法表示憤慨。本月二十六日，美日商約即將失效，現在並未採取具體步驟談判新商約或臨時辦法。此事的含義就是說，到了本月二十六日，日本就不能享受美國務卿赫爾與二十二國所訂互惠商約中規定的減稅待遇。其本身就含有一種懲罰的意義，國會方面且有多數議員主張通過一種禁止軍火和原料運往日本的法案，此種舉動在美日現行商約廢止後即可在法理上付諸實施了。國務院亦已決定態度，就是美國在華權益茍未獲得保障，即不與日本談判新商約。美國在中國的地位早已由美國與中國合法政府簽訂各種條約各種協定，予以確定，不承認第三者日本有權加以變更或加以修正。</p>
<p>美國對日這種態度決不因蘇聯又向遠東注意而絲毫有所軟化。日本與蘇聯的種種舉動，美國視同一邱之貉。美國政府當局譴責蘇聯實與譴責日德同樣嚴厲。該三國間雖並沒有什麼了不得的諒解，但在美國目光中，都是違反國際公法的國家。美國決不願在該三國之間，拉攏一國以抵制另一國。美國對遠東局勢可以說不復在於維持均勢了。從前美國慣常助俄抑日，或助日抑俄的。美國在一九三三年承認蘇聯也是含有抵制日本的意味的。該兩國間茍有一國過於强盛，美國常會反對該國發展的。一八九九年，俄國的經濟勢力侵入滿洲，就是促成門戶開放政策的一種主要原因。迨至上次歐戰後，美國出兵西伯比利却是要遏止日本的野心。美國有史以來對於日俄兩國當是如此的。現在已將此種傳統政策放棄了。到了最近，蘇聯對於芬蘭的態度，美國旣嚴辭加以譴責，蘇聯的報紙亦反唇相譏。蘇聯駐美大使館慶祝十月革命紀念時，美國閣員和參議員竟無一人參加，僅由國務院蘇聯司派一次要代表出席敷衍，美國不滿蘇聯的情緒可見一斑。</p>
<p>若以蘇聯與德日的關係而論，美國所注意的是蘇聯與日本的關係，較甚爲蘇聯與德國的關係，但也承認兩方面不無平行的原素存乎其間。美國國務院次長梅薩斯密司最近檢討外交政策時，雖未提及蘇聯，但對遠東則會有詳盡的陳述。他涉及華盛頓條約時會說，「近數年來，這些條約已因遠東方面的不幸的事變受了重大影響。美國政府仍當恪守這些條約的目標，精神和條文……任何修正必須根據這些條約的原文，顧及美國的權益，依照國際公法的所規定的手續辦理，不能由任何一國以片面的行動出之。……國內一部人主張將美國外交政策的基本原則暫時擱置，直到瞬息萬變的國際局勢穩定之後再定進退。國際舞台的新結合或不免須要吾國政策改絃更張。我對於這種主張敢堅決的答之曰，其他各國間無論有何結合，美國民族決不因而放棄其基本原則……外國的集團無論有何變化，美國決不撤消國際關係應循序漸進的主張。」不過美國雖準備爲倡導者爲評判者，但不願爲執行者。這層，梅薩斯密司次長也曾加以說明的。（譯字林西報華盛頓特約稿）</p>

<h3>二十八年上海金融之動態</h3>
<p>— 朱博泉</p>
<p>一，前言</p>
<p>自二十六年冬戰事蔓延，沿江沿海各口岸，相繼失守，上海乃有孤島之感，此就政治環境交通情形言固然，就經濟情形言之，亦復如是。</p>
<p>上海向爲東南貿易中心，今各地農產土產，如棉，如米，如絲繭，如　　，如牲畜，在內地者，或因政府禁令，或因交通梗阻，多數不能運滬；在淪陷區者，多半　　　一被把持被收買，其可自由運滬供銷費或爲集散者，實已寥寥無幾，而淪陷區之工業及其他業，不論今尚存在與吾，一切無從過問，故上海與各地間原有之正常經濟關係，已如藕斷絲連，大異平昔，即如本年各地豐收，而貿遷之利，大部份殊非國人所自有。</p>
<p>在叙述正文之前，吾人須先就孤島內部一般的經濟情形，先加審視，而後對一年來之金融市塲，可以有比較親切之體會。</p>
<p>孤島以內之經濟，戰後甚多病態，一年以來，允爲顯著，茲先擇要分述之：</p>
<p>因（一）上海租界之秩序與安全，相當的得以維持不墜，故戰事中各地避難民衆，咸視上海爲世外之桃源，兩年以來，愈聚愈衆，人之所聚，資金隨之；加以（二）北方之經濟設施，本年　　翻新樣，（三）歐洲發生戰事，英國東方屬地施行金融統制，由此兩者，所引起之資金逃避，一　份亦以上海爲淵藪，故二十六年積滯上海之資金，年來乃益見其泛濫，雖資金移植西南之論，年來甚囂鏖上，銀錢同業中，實行者雖亦不少，但大規模之移植，恐非一蹴可幾，宜如何統籌並顧，疏散上海之資金，使其運用得循正軌，其尚有待更進一步之努力歟。此游資之充斥，病態一也。</p>
<p>游資之充斥如此，而正常之投資途徑，復因上述與各地貿易關係之阻斷而愈覺缺少，於是外匯外幣黃金，以至各種貨物之買賣，至今歲而盛極一時，投機者視爲咄嗟致富之捷徑，杞憂者視爲私人資財之保障，不趨於此，即歸於彼。此投機之旺盛，病態二也。</p>
<p>今年物價飛漲，照中國統計學社發表數字，以二十五年爲基準，二十六年爲一一八强，二十七年爲一五三弱，本年六月爲一六四，步步高陞，至九月而爲二八三强。其原因爲（甲）外匯暗市之狂縮，（乙）歐戰之繼起，加以（丙）界內形形色色之貨物投機，（丁）界外形形色色之統制。蓋孤島內之物價，其支配者已不限於經濟的因素，於是米珠薪桂，已不僅爲文字上之形容，孤島內之大衆，實已與戰區人民，同其負擔，此實目下甚嚴重而不容忽視之問題，病態三也。</p>
<p>因當地銷費之日鉅，物價之激增，歐戰之刺激，界內小工業進口商及零售商等，年來均致小康，地產及建築事業，亦因人口續增而視前年益形活潑。此界內工商業之繁榮氣象，其爲病態，不容諱言，病態四也。</p>
<p>茲將一年來金融市塲情形，分節叙述於後。</p>
<p>二，法幣發行</p>
<p>法幣發行總額在戰前之二十六年六月底爲十四萬萬元（約數下仿此；）戰後之同年年底，爲十六萬萬元，二十七年六月底，爲十七萬萬元，本年七月，政府公布二十八年六月底法幣發行總額，爲二十六萬萬元，現金準備與保證凖備之比率，原爲六十與四十者，今爲四四與五六。就上述數字比較之，則戰後第一年中發行之增加，僅爲三萬萬元，第二年中之增加，爲九萬萬九，今年六月底止發行額，比戰前的增一倍。</p>
<p>關於戰後法幣發行約增一倍之事，當時頗有惡意的評述。但：（一）吾國自二十四年幣制改革後，在二十五年一年中，發行額約增六萬萬元，其後戰事發生，在戰事第一年中增加數反見減小，其實此時法幣發行，續在進展過程中，而增加量之所以反見减小者，多半由於政府劉於法幣發行，始終採健全保守之政策，在戰事初期，允更有聚縮之趨勢。（二）法幣在戰區中，雖多方遭受破壞與利用，而西南各省需要甚返，視他國紙幣行使，本已達相當程度，或已達極度者，未可同日而語。一年以來，政府屢次聲明，維持法幣之政策，始終未變，蓋對戰區法幣，旣極力設法緊縮，對上海法幣供給，亦復極端審愼，皆為勝於雄辯之事實，惡性之通貨膨脹，可謂至今並無絲毫跡象。至現金準備較減，則誠如政府所稱仍較多數國家為高。</p>
<p>自外匯暗市頻縮，八月間復有政府在國外訂有大量法幣之謠傳，在謠言多如波浪之孤島中，「法幣是否將成馬克」之疑問，吾人時有所聞，此在稍明事理，稍具常識，稍知馬克之歷史，稍明法幣發行之狀況者，固可立時加以否定，但外匯市塲之狂熱，已因之而驟然增高矣。法幣在上海流通數量若干，吾人無從估計，但因法幣狀況，甚為一般人士所關心，輒於本節略述一二。</p>
<p>本年物價飛漲，法幣在上海之購買力，減低頗多，但同一法幣之購買力，上海與各地大不相同，各地又有所異，試以食米而言，浙東市價，僅為上海之半，蓋滬市物價之高，已不僅爲各種經濟因素所支配，已如前述，法幣暗市滙價之低，固爲上述經濟因素之一，而法幣發行量之增加，尚不足構成因素也。至內地之物價，雖均視戰前爲高，亦各有其生產方面及交通方面之原因。</p>
<p>因各國加緊擴張軍備，五金市價高漲，夏秋之間，市上流通之銅元銅輔幣及銅鎳輔幣，均被收買一空，加以銷融及私運。市上除角位輔幣劵外，輔幣幾乎絕跡，於是先則以郵票爲代替品，繼之由電車票汽車票印花等等，皆成暫時之輔幣，一般商店，復各印代價券以供零找，五光十色，大衆極感不便，物價之上漲，無形中殆亦受其助力，九月以後，中央銀行發行五分一分輔幣劵，並增發角位輔幣劵，以應需要，其數紫似尚覺不敷。</p>
<p>三，外匯暗市</p>
<p>本年金融上變化最多影響最鉅者，爲外滙暗市。自去年政府實施外滙管理，中央銀行依法定價格供給外滙後，因其供給極度嚴格，故一般的外滙需嬰，依然取給於暗市，其交易相當繁盛，市價亦因政府之調劑而頗爲穩定。本年情形，可分三個時期分述之：</p>
<p>第一時期爲一至五月年初外滙暗市，仍盤旋於八便士至八便士半左右。三月間滙兌平凖基金會成立，置基金一千萬鎊，並由英國借款充基金之半數，暗市外滙，因此益鮮漲落，惟外滙需要仍鉅，大別言之，的有四種原因：</p>
<p>（一）爲入超之龐大上海雖向爲入超口岸，而入超之鉅，未有甚於此時者。本年一月至六月上海對外貿易依Ｆinance＆Ｃommerce統計，其進口貨先按法定價格折合英金，再照暗市時價折合國幣，總計進口的六萬萬元，出口的一萬七千萬元，半年中入超逮四萬三千萬元，約當二十七年同時期入超之十三倍。（二）爲北方資金之逃避華北方面，於今春强制使行其所謂聯銀紙幣，分期壓低法幣價格，即天津租界法幣之流通行使，亦多方遭受威脅，於是東北資金，源源逃來上海，其中一部份之歸宿，即爲外滙。（三）爲日人之套買北方及其他戰區內法幣被搜刮之技倆，旣層出而不窮，此項法幣來滬之後，亦隨時易爲外滙。（四）上海一般人士對法幣之信仰，雖歷久而彌堅，而戰時民衆心理，逈異平時，人云亦云，在所不免，儘多出於過慮，惟窖藏法幣之風，施之於外滙者，外滙市塲因此又多一種負担，同時市面出口滙票，稀如麟鳳，在此供過於求之狀態下，五個多月暗市匯價之繼續穩定，殆全由於政府及平準會先後之支持也。</p>
<p>第二時期爲自六月至八月六月七日，滙兌平準基金會對暗市滙價，暫時停止維持，公布之始，有如晴天霹靂，一市震驚，謠諑乘之，於是投機的與盲目的購買，紛至沓來，滙豐銀行於一日間三易其掛牌，穩定已有十八個月之八便士暗市滙價，遂在跌至六便士半左右。</p>
<p>平準會之停止暗市外滙供給也，當時除無謂及惡意之謠言外，頗多各種不同之揣測，最普通者，如謂三個月來，基金已罄，不能再事維持。其實上半年外滙之購買狀况，旣如上述，在此種狀況之存續中，今後對八便士滙價之繼續維持，是否為明智之舉，不待煩言，基金存底之豐絀，猶為次要之問題。故七月十日財政當局發表談話，謂事屬政府所核定，其目的在使暗市滙價「適合於有利中國經濟之標準」云云，市面視聽，爲之一正。同時六便士半左右之新水準下，市塲有相當供給，喘息得以稍蘇。（未完）</p>
<h3>日本經濟在崩潰</h3>
<p>— 趙簡子</p>
<p>露骨的崩象</p>
<p>日本首相阿部站脚不穩的理由很多；但下議員只揀經濟無辦法當作攻擊的對象。軍部也把「中國事變的解决不足爲戀棧的藉口。」而壓迫阿部下台。道破民間疾苦，不論其爲幌子，總是政爭上最有力量的手段。由此已可想見他國民生活不安之一斑！（編者：阿部內閣已倒）</p>
<p>日本戰時內閣的改組已經第四次了，用經濟問題作倒閣理由的這還是第一次。日本經濟本患着先天不足的痼疾，戰爭更加强了他這病勢。在過去，日本民間的疾苦早已忍無可忍，他的統治階級却還避不談及，力持鎭靜。現在突然慌亂起來；而且還在過半數議員的聯名簽署之下，作爲倒閣的公開理由，大聲疾呼地在叫着。當然已危在旦夕；吾則定必還要諱疾忌醫的！</p>
<p>統治階級的瓦解</p>
<p>日本的統治階級，是軍閥官僚財閥的混合體。國民經濟瓦解時給他們的第一個威脅，便是「財政無辦法」。</p>
<p>「財政無辦法」：軍閥便無威可張；因爲他的威風，只仗着那些現代化的武器；而這些武器，是先要靠榨取民脂民膏才能得來。官僚活躍的能力和目的，不外是錢。沒有錢，在他們也就束手無策。財閥對於財政，獨怕財政負擔太大，無法轉嫁給民眾；利潤要激減，還有自己掏腰包的危險。所以每提財政問題，日本的統治階級便要自相曆擦起來。現在下議員攻擊的對象，雖是糧食和物價，似乎在替民衆講話；骨子裏却在替自己打算。不過這算盤，確非從安定民生根本做起來不可。於是便挑中了關切民生放嚴重的糧食和物價這兩點了。</p>
<p>財政無辦法</p>
<p>在過去兩年半裏：歲出共遠二百十億；其中一百二十七億却擲在中國戰塲而就烟消雲散了。爲了籌措這筆一無代價的支出，曾增發了一百零七億的公債，十一億多的紙幣（鮮臺及在華軍票等等尚不在內）；還把一般稅負增加了五成至三四倍。像普通所得稅，過去只納五十元的，現在要納二百十一元；像臨時利得稅，過去只納三十元的，現在非納足一百四十元就要入獄。何况在這種絕望的支出之外，還要賠上成千百萬條的生命，不可計數的種種物質的精神的間接損失！</p>
<p>明年度歲出總額比本年度又激增十億餘萬而達一百零四億元，臨時軍事費雖列四十五憶，一般會計却增加七億弱而達四十九億五千元。其中陸海兩部合增五億弱，共佔二十三億强；債務費已增二億而達、億，爲了供應如此龐大的經費，於是無情地再把稅負提高，但預計所增不到十億；所以只好再計劃增發五十五億元新公債。</p>
<p>過去兩年半增發的一百零七億新公債，其中二十一億是交給預金部負責，七十六億是交給日本銀行負資。這便是他的所謂「公債消化」。在昭和十一年末（即戰爭前的一九三六年末），日本國債現負額是一百零四億；翌年（即開戰第一個半年末）即增至一百十九億；十三年末增至一百六十二億；昨年十一月末巳增至二百零九億弱，到明年會計年度末，恐怕就要突破三百億的關口。</p>
<p>姑不問何能長此以往？待看現在，日本政府和人民，都已走到水窮山盡的絕途了。</p>
<p>國民經濟的瓦解</p>
<p>試看下議員們所攻擊的物價和糧食這兩點，其中包括着日本戰時經濟體制瓦解的一切症象。戰爭的物質需要，把外滙資源和國民的生活資源都消耗殆盡；於是物價暴漲，而且一無辦法。去年十一月，批發物價指數增至二四二%，零售物價指數增至二三五•七%，生活費指數增至二二六%，無論府實行高壓的統制，漲勢依然日盛一日。</p>
<p>戰爭的人力需要，抽空了農村和都市間的勞力。據金鋼鑽社調查女工和童工所佔工塲工人總數的比率，已平均較戰前增加一倍多而達四八•一%；農村間的情形更爲惡劣。於是農產銳减，饑荒日重。人力不足，軍隊　死亡是無法補充，增加生產是陷於絕　；對外貿易便愈趨惡化。過去二年十一個月，對第三國的輸出不過五十八億七千萬元，輸入却達七十六億二千萬，入超共達十八億元。以他戰前國際收支裏的貿易外收支情形說，大多是支付超過收入的：像昭和十年是付超一億九千四百萬元，十一年是付超三千六百萬元，在此情形之下，誰能相信他所公佈的那些發行金凖備的報告？</p>
<p>日本國內黃金年產量，據他自己說也不過一億元多些，無論如何决不能抵償國際收支上的逆超。於是調達海外物資的辦法，除了攫取中國淪陷區裏的外匯資源外，便只有奪取他國內人民的生活需要以資挹補。奪取民需以應軍需，已是挖肉補瘡的末技；何况壓迫民需的另一面，便是財政稅源的澈底枯竭。於是財政上更非仰給於舉債和增發紙幣不可，紙幣愈膨脹，物價尤昂昇，購買力愈减退，民間商品交易量愈衰枯，紙幣發行上的收縮率便等於零。像本年一月份的紙幣發行收縮率已只有二六•四%，至十一月已减剩一〇•四%；十月份且縮剩六•九％，純通貨膨脹正是惡性通貨膨脹中的主要現象。日本的戰時經濟，正在這純通貨膨脹的惡性末路上邁進。無可如何，不惜禁止流出國外的紙幣回歸國內，這種「出門別人貨」的末技，不特喪盡了日圓的信用，其實也軋斷了他國際收入裏的海外僑民匯款回國的外匯資源，而這項收入正是牠貿易外收入項中主要的科目。所以結果益益增大了調達物資上的困難；於是週而復始地從舉債，增稅，加發紙幣，奪取民需，促成物價高漲，購買力激减，民閒交易衰退，稅源枯竭等等的這種末路循環，終於踏進今日水窮山盡的絕境了。</p>
<p>結論</p>
<p>日本的統治階級已看到戰事延長一天，中國抗建經濟基礎便强大一天，而他自己的戰爭經濟基礎離澈底破產的日子更近一天。所以他們急切想和。但無條件的和，日本軍閥回去交不出賬；有條件的和，决非中國所願聞問。因爲這種僵局的相持；在中國，正是長期抗戰勝算的地方；在日本，却就難逃全盤崩潰的危運；而這種危運，現正疾捲飛來。所以展望中日戰爭前途時，除日本人之外，絕無考慮戰和問題的必要；只有勝與敗的目標；而且勝利必屬諸中國，敗北必屬諸日本。日本議員空前地以經濟問題作爲倒閣的理由，正反映了日本經濟已開始急速崩潰的微象；也設明了中國抗戰已操最後勝利的左券爲迎接最後勝利的迂速到來，除軍事上的努力之外，應加强經濟上的抗戰。在淪陷區裏的人民，尤應厲行物資上的反對鎖，以粉碎他借體還魂的迷夢！不應藉口環境特殊，伸着脖子任他實行抽血工作！</p>

<p>性學知識</p>
<h3>性的骨外刺戟的分論</h3>
<p>— 俄國勞動大學醫科畢業楊道南醫師</p>
<p>…內刺戟由於青春腺內分泌素旺盛而起…外刺戟由於淫書及美色引誘而生</p>
<p>性欲雖為人生的本能，不學而知，不告面能，但其能引起性的亢進者，必有其原因存在，原因唯何？即內外刺戟的關係是也。所謂內刺戟者，卽並無外界之引誘而其性欲自然潑生衝動是也，其原因亦有二種！一即靑春腺之旺盛，二爲甲狀腺腦下垂體等內分泌刺戟素之旺盛，此種靑春腺或甲狀腺內分泌，本有一定之量，但果旺盛，此種分泌，皆足以刺戟性神經，使之發動，分泌過多，則性神經受其刺戟者愈甚，則其發動愈烈，於是性慾衝動，遂一發而不得止。故卽並無外界之引誘，其性慾亦能自然衝動。</p>
<p>至於外刺戟則有多種，有屬於精神上者，有屬於生理上者，前者由精神作用而起，如閱覽淫書，淫戲，淫畫，以及有美色當前等，皆屬於此。任何老誠篤實，而遇有外物引誘，其神經上自必發生刺戟，一經刺戟，則性神經之受其牽引，性慾衝動，自不能免，故內外刺戟的兩大原因，研究性學者，實不可不知。</p>
<p>內刺戟之靑春腺若失却其繁榮，其性慾卽現病態，雖有外界之引誘，雖美色當前，亦無能爲矣。故善於衛生者，必不使主宰性慾的靑春腺素，爲荒淫而斵傷，蓋靑春腺除年歲過高而表頹外，厥爲手淫過度，或縱慾荒淫而起。靑春腺不振之後，遺精滑精，早洩陰痿，發育不全，神經衰弱各症，必不能免，房事時何能得到快感，此不僅爲自己體質衰弱之象微，而影響夫婦間之愛情實非淺鮮。</p>
<p>今旣明瞭性欲刺戟在於靑春腺的繁榮，故陰痿早洩等症，亦因靑春腺之失健所致，故對症治法，唯有積極服以雄壯動物靑春腺內分泌素男用「補體康」最爲對症，蓋「補體康內含純粹之睪丸精質，均採自猩猩與猿猴，蓋猩猩猿猴性質最適合人體，並有補腦之燐質，補血之鐵質，補骨之鈣質摻入，服後廿四小時卽生精補腎，其女用「補體康」功能調經種子，久爲醫師所推崇。</p>
<p>淋病春秋</p>
<h3>破天荒之驅淋藥</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士　黃仲昌醫師</p>
<p>年來余對淋病之冶療，已較前更趨順利；因余對於淋病之病理的解剖，旣憑科　和經騐爲之鑑別，而用藥方面，又有特效藥出世。給予吾人以强大之助力。</p>
<p>說起淋病特效藥之發明，也不是偶然之事。原來淋病之傳染力，旣極强大，而一經傳染，在「克淋儂」未曾發明之前，簡直使醫家和病家無法爲之解脫，故每染淋病，無不由急化慢，由慢性而成惡化。一入惡化的淋病，則患者不僅有使病症絕孕之危險，更有生命被其犧牲，良堪痛惜。故各國對於此病，莫不積極作防淋作用，而以榮譽與金錢，獎勵科學家，當然重賞之下，必有勇夫，而給德國淋病學大師彼德博士，首着先鞭，發明淋病特效藥「克淋儂」一藥，奏空前之奇效，不愧爲淋病療法上之破天荒。於是世界上最有榮譽與獎金，遂爲彼德博士所得而公認爲淋病特效藥。余對於此藥，有良好而愉快的印象。</p>
<p>不論初起，或已成慢性之白濁，服「克淋儂」均能於最短期內發生抗淋噬菌作用，此作用發生於體內每一細胞，故其殺菌力洋溢全身，無遠不屆，無微不至；故不論急慢性淋病，皆可服用。至於外用藥方面，男子可外用「抗淋水」按圖與說明，在洗滌尿道，女子淋毒白帶，除亦內服「克淋儂」之外，可一方外用「卡而雪地陰道片」爲坐藥，則奏效允速盛在强醫師</p>
<h3>咳嗽與吐血</h3>
<p>— 盛在強醫師</p>
<p>大家都知道。凡是具有肺癆質之人。其肺臟異常脆弱。實在經不起怎樣震動。而在這震動中。肺臟細血管震破而出血。此種使肺臓受到震動的無過於咳嗽。故咳嗽與吐血。有密切的關係。此實極顯明之事。要防吐血。先當鎮咳。而能使咳嗽在三小時內鎭靜的。惟有「補肺拿爾二藥。足可當之。故咳嗽時服用此藥。可預防肺出血。此乃余二十年來經騐所得之正確結果。</p>
<h3>四肢畏寒治愈例</h3>
<p>— 德國醫學博士　鄭　霆</p>
<p>患者兪承達，年三十七歲，浙江寗波人，住木埠舢板廠新僑永安里二號，（自訴）——本人先天不足，婚前亦有遺精，婚後感覺腎虧，至三十歲後，精神愈不振，稍坐即覺腰酸背痛，至三十五歲時，每逢節氣，渾身戰慄，四肢冰冷，不能起床，衰老之象，令人寒心，乞治云云。（診時病象）——體重九十五磅★面色蒼白，素患失眠症，房事雖不過度，然早洩甚烈，蓋其血腎兩虧，未老先衰也。（治愈經過）——囑渠從事運動，勿吸煙酒，日閒服以睪丸精質製劑男用「補體康」三次，每次三片。服後即覺精神大振，腰酸背痛，四肢畏寒等症盡治，蓋一補體康」功能促進新陳代謝，消除神經衰弱，補腦，補腎，補血，助長生殖器之發育。故頗爲對症，兪君連服二月，上述各症完全治愈，體重已增七磅，乃檢查其性機能，勃起力也較前强烈，兪君鑒該劑功效如神，乃繼續購服，服至上月底停服，體重達一百十磅，面色紅潤，食慾增進，以前兪君每次交秋冬，四肢畏寒，現雖在嚴冬，絕不感覺寒慄也</p>
<p>淋病講座</p>
<h3>淋病有損伉儷之福</h3>
<p>— 姚菊巖醫師撰診時：上午址時至下午六時</p>
<p>「無病是神仙，有妻萬事足」，上句是成語，下句係套「有子寓事足」一語而成。實在，以我廿餘年來之經騐，世間夫婦愛情，原甚濃厚者，而往往因花柳病而破壞其愛情者，實繁有徒，故患花柳病者，往往因病毒傳染，使妻子起了無名的憤恨，這樣一來，人生還有多大趣味？所以一有了花柳病，尤其淋病，即宜立卽醫療，有了淋病，等於妻子要求離婚之絕好證據，縱有賢明的妻子，勉强相留，而度共凄苦的生活，自是非伉儷之福了。由於上述等原因，凡是傳染淋病者，最好於未入慢性淋時期，即於治療，旣可迅速治愈，又可避免傳染妻子，一舉而數得。萬一已被庸醫劣藥所誤，而轉入慢性者，允不可不及早醫治。</p>
<p>至於治療方法，余從多年來之經騐，惟有用淋病特效藥「克淋儂」一藥，功效最爲優異，因此藥係用非特異性療法，採取蛋白體黃色素混合製成，服後能於數小時內發生抗淋噬菌的作用，並能在病灶上起直接的殺菌功效，而不碍及共他健全之部份，余更用德國感應靜電療法，及德國抗淋血淸，結果無不收預期的卓效。如妻子亦被傳染，而有淋毒性白帶，除內服「克淋儂」外，可外用「卡而雪地陰道片」爲坐藥，亦能收同等之效果，而恢復伉儷閒之宰福診時：上午十時至下午六時每天送診廿號每號僅取號金五角並贈性病全書一冊。</p>

<h3>抑平米價建議　法律行政同時並舉　當局居民共同努力</h3>
<p>— 立</p>
<p>米價自從兩租界當局限制以後，並出示公告，如有人壟斷操縱，兩租界當局均將不予保護、或將其囤積存貨充公。辦法不能不說是相當嚴厲，同時各界關心民食諸公組織食糧調節恊會，設法籌款訂購洋米，以稍殺壟斷操縱者的野心。一時表面上米價不超出限價；但實際上仍舊明鬆暗緊。可見得若輩喪盡天良的米蠧，尚在潛行活動；倘使社會人士，只嫌米價貴，不羣策羣力，要想吃便宜米，恐怕專靠民食調節恊會訂購洋米，在此外匯高漲時期，還是不能達到目的的。然而怎樣辦法才對呢？據筆者個人意見：</p>
<p>（一）多設平糶處　運銷洋米一層，現在已由民食調節恊會設法辦理；不過在升斗小民方面，一時要拿出一包米定價的一半來，確是一件不容易的事，所以仍舊享不到利益。必定要在適當地方盡量多設幾處平糶處，以供給各方的需要，使米蠧的米永遠囤積在倉庫裏，除了蟲蛀霉爛，或者照估價平糶以外，沒有人去問津；那末米蠧自然感到無所售其奸，再也不去囤積了。雖然明知道國內產米區域，今年異常豐收，何必去訂購洋米，拿外匯來結算，豈不是和國米價相差無幾嗎？但是要知道：國米在出產地，並沒有如此高價，傳聞蕪湖的米，一江之隔，價大不同，一則須二十元左右一擔，一則尚不滿十元，相差如此之大，無非有否在特殊勢力統制的，就可明白所以然的原因了。至於運到上海，還須要特殊勢力方面的採辦證，然而也只能運到虹口；如果要移入蘇州河以南，還要想個辦法，所以即使米蠧種種設法抬高米價，計算利益，遠不如特殊勢力的中飽的多。這些中飽的錢愈多，就是中國慘死的同胞愈多。幾處地方的轟炸，飛機炸彈，多少是這種錢變成功的。那末，我們一面吃貴價的國米，還要受到慘酷的殘害，到不如吃洋米身心安樂戰。這原是不得已的辦法，人非喪心病狂，豈肯利權外溢的嗎？（未完）</p>

<p>衣食住行</p>
<h3>共衣食住行四事相輔相成之精神享樂</h3>
<p>— 樂天</p>
<p>—如「好風月」不用一錢買—</p>
<p>自一九三九年九月歐戰勃興，西方先進國精神修養之新識新知，每是以備舉世救國英賢之及時自救。矧吾華飽經國難，國人辛苦圖存，豈能無悻悻不安之色，然茍念及意志之可戰勝環境，自覺絕處逢生而萬象盡呈喜氣，新式賀年之方法，應與往古不同。我民如有志協助中樞，脫險境而進於樂境，首宜打破「憤怒」「憂苦」與「沈寂」之三大難關。此爲民二十九新年渴望我同胞轉入好運之最新良藥，本人適從第二歐戰之西方友邦，觀察得之，善與人同，不容自秘者也。</p>
<p>一曰憤怒：吾華俗語，稱動怒爲「發氣」，而今證以西說，竟屬不謀而同。西說準據醫理，謂無論男女老少，天性常怒者殊不多見。憤怒爲暫時之變態，大抵起於身體之疲乏。「發氣」猶發熱，乃爲此身應付環境之自動反應，正如蒸汽機之「保安抽蓋」，茍當內部熱氣過度飽滿時，每能自動啟抽蓋而噴出熱氣。犬在無病時，蓄犬者信手撫弄而　態怡然，假令犬身破傷作痛，稍觸之便即狂　，人之過疲而「發氣」，其理正與相同。惜乎一般動氣之人，不肯自承體疲之爲發氣原因耳。總之人身保安有兩策，下策是任其發氣，上策乃藉休息以減身體之疲。一說戒除刺激性之胡椒等物，亦可防制憤怒。又一說謂動作日記，寫出易使對方發氣之言語或舉動，因自省而不更發氣，深與精神分析學者療病之論相合也。</p>
<p>二曰憂苦：凡人身遇無可排解之憂苦，如即立志救人，運用心思或能力，進而解除同胞或同伴之憂苦，每可以忘自身之憂苦。或與他人苦境相比較，尤易了解自身之苦境。</p>
<p>三曰沈寂：年荒世亂之家庭，男子或爲國效忠，或爲生計奔走，女性因不易享團聚之樂而感沈寂者，比比皆是。其尤甚者，爲因荒亂而造成之寡鰥孤獨。此時欲求打破沈寂之難關，首應尋得適合於身心之事業或工作。人必勤勞而精神方有寄託，一切牢愁與恐怖，自將無以發生。至若女性，最宜於救助他人。如歐戰期婦女界之紛紛結綫，以爲戰士難胞製寒衣，自是解除沈寂之一種要訣。</p>
<p>天下無永不變好之惡運，亦無永不變惡之好運，禍福相倚伏，不　　夜相循環，新運方來，剝極則復，上述精神享樂三要道，我貧國之家庭可與共享，所謂「好風月不用一錢買」也。</p>
<h3>蛇皮皮包</h3>
<p>— 秦家駒</p>
<p>龍虎門是粵菜的上品，大概大家都已久聞其名。而蛇皮皮包恐怕上海人還很少知道。這是海防的特產。他們把美味的蛇肉吃去後，剩下的皮就用來做皮包。每隻皮包大概用四五張花紋不同蛇皮縫成，所以找不出一隻花式相同的皮包。於是在海防的上海小姐，都是人手一隻，表示新奇。這種皮包的價錢並不貴，而質地十分堅牢耐用，又能免除沾染污漬，所以男人用作皮夾的也很多。不過放在袋裏，和身體太接近，似乎有些擔心。我想好奇的上海人們，一定也很想得到一隻玩玩，至少可以長一些見識。可惜船上不能多帶，否則倒是一件送與女性的很好的禮物。</p>
<h3>家庭小常識</h3>
<p>— 世傑</p>
<p>用破舊雨傘上的油紙燒成灰，調以香油，塗在沸水燙傷之處，可防潰爛。</p>
<p>皮鞋受濕後，可用新聞紙扯成碎片塞在鞋裏，不但能吸收潮濕，而且還可保持鞋的原狀。</p>
<p>要想使襪子耐穿，最好多預備幾隻，每天調換一次。把換下的襪子用水浸濕，擦上肥皂，擱置三小時後，然後用水沖洗曬乾；這樣，不但潔淨而且綫質不易受傷。</p>
<p>黑色帆布鞋如果褪了色，用毛刷括鍋底灰刷之，則烏黑如新。</p>
<p>皮鞋若不光亮的時候，用檸檬擦二三次，使光輝煊目。</p>
<p>新購的磁器，若放在鹽水中煮過，可經久耐用。</p>
<h3>一星期經濟菜單</h3>
<p>— 華英女士</p>
<p>肉價貴得要命，無論豬肉牛肉羊肉，都比從前貴上二三倍，實在有些吃不起，至於雞肉鴨肉，更不必說，家常是沒有這口福去吃了。所以每天除了買一些豬肉牛肉來切切肉絲殺　以外，只得多吃些菜蔬。菜蔬之中，現在大青菜經了霜打，已很可口，還有一種小塔窠菜，也可換換口味，難說有時帶些苦味，但是多放些糖和油，燒得透一些，風味倒也不惡。講起菜價來每斤也要輔幣一角左右，自然今非昔比，然而比了肉價，到底還便宜得多啊。</p>
<p>星期一</p>
<p>百葉炒肉絲　糖醋煎帶魚　清炒塔窠菜　海蜇　蔔菜</p>
<p>星期二</p>
<p>芹菜牛肉湯　粉皮白魚頭　菠菜燒豆腐　雪菜黃豆芽</p>
<p>星期三</p>
<p>黃豆燉豬脚　蝦米蛋花湯　青菜炒油條　紅燒　蔔片</p>
<p>星期四</p>
<p>咖喱牛肉片　葱烤小　魚　湖葱燒豆腐　紅燒捲心菜</p>
<p>星期五</p>
<p>膠菜肉絲湯　雪菜燒黃魚　紅燒素十景　乾絲拌芹菜</p>
<p>星期六</p>
<p>紅燒羊肉片　膠菜青魚片　蝦子炒麵筋　雪菜菉豆芽</p>
<p>星期日　乳腐肉　燉帶魚　金花菜　炒　蔔</p>
<h3>談船渡</h3>
<p>— 器予</p>
<p>大家知道渡船是爲代替橋樑之不足而設的，普通在河口廣闊而又是陸路交通便捷的所在，因建築橋樑工程浩大或所費過鉅，遂有道渡船的設立。時常有一隻民船往來於兩岸渡載顧客，既便利，又合算，實在是內陸交通的重要輔助。</p>
<p>江南河道從橫，交通比較發達，所以船渡也特別的多。尤其以蘇州無錫幾縣，因爲臨近太湖，港灣紛岐，渡船隨處都有。通常祗要化一枚銅元，就可以省却你很久的跋涉，那又何樂而不爲呢？</p>
<p>近代科學倡明，交通日趨發達，船渡的用途更爲廣泛而完善了。就以浦江上的渡船言，以前都是民船，每當潮漲或波濤洶湧的時候，渡過這寬闊的江面，船夫固然煞費艱苦，而渡客也飽受驚駭。但自有輪渡後，就不再有這種危險了。</p>
<p>但渡船不僅是渡人，且可用以渡汽車及火車。像鎮江到揚州，中間隔着一條大江，然而鎮揚公路的汽車，依舊可以直達通行，就是利用民船來擺渡的緣故。再如戰前的滬平直達通車，其中南京到浦口京滬和津浦兩鐵路的銜接，也就是靠長江中的輪渡，先將貨車駛上輪船，渡到對岸，然後再接連鐵路，貨車就可駛出，再簡捷沒有了，若要在長江上駕起一座橋來，那是談何容易呢？</p>
<p>目前政府，正在積極開發內地，尤以公路交通最爲重要，而船渡亦是很緊要的輔助，實在不容忽視的。</p>
<h3>食與健康</h3>
<p>— 曹靈佑</p>
<p>食的適當與否？對於我們的健康，有　大的影響。爲便利敘述起見，分三點扼要述之。</p>
<p>（一）食時的心情</p>
<p>無論在何時何地就食時，總要心中充滿着快樂。要是含着憤怒或不安的心情去就食，是絕對無益於身體的。</p>
<p>（二）食的方法</p>
<p>食物進口後，應緩緩的細嚼，然後嚥下，最標準的細嚼，次數爲三十二次。用湯水或茶，硬把食物吞下去，不但無益，反會造成種種的胃病。</p>
<p>（三）食的營養</p>
<p>食物總要分配平均，不宜天天吃着一種菜，每餐食物的種類亦不宜太多，以二三種爲最適合，如此才不致妨礙消化，據衛生學家的研究，雞蛋蔬菜的營養，遠在山珍海味之上。</p>

<h3>甯波的衣食住行</h3>
<p>— 朱庭筠</p>
<p>自從各海口先後被封鎖以後，甯波便成爲前往內地的唯一交通綫，往來行旅貨運，相當繁忙，雖然，今年春季，甯波也和其他各地遭受同樣的轟炸，可是現在早已從瓦礫堆中重建起新的市容，比以前更是繁榮了，這一次筆者留甬半月，對於甯波的衣食住行作了一個簡略的調查。</p>
<p>目前在甯波最流行的服裝，要算是草綠和淡黃色的軍裝了；不論在街頭，公共場所，男的，女的，隨時隨地都是很容易見得到，就是小孩子們，也很多穿着，布幫腿，平頂頭，外罩棉大衣，精神是購奮發的。此外，國貨皮革製的短大衣，穿的人也很多，至於普通衣服，那確要比較樸素得多。洋貨衣料也要佔據着大多數，不過袒胸露臂的所謂摩登時裝，那就很不容易尋到呢。</p>
<p>食的方面，各種民生日用品，確便宜得多，米價每石祗售二十餘元，這對於民生問題關係非淺，至於各種菜蔬，因爲離開農村較近的緣故，自然低廉，像隻隻跳的鮮蝦，剛從竹園裏掘出來的冬笋，既新鮮，又便宜，不過鮮帶魚類的海魚，因舟山等處海面，漁船不能出口捕捉，反需仰給於上海，價格也就貴起來，這確是一件夠悲憤的事。水菓祗有黃巖的桔子和金橋味亦鮮美。土產品以「甯波年糕」最爲著名，其次苔條餅，方糕；荳酥糖，藕絲糖等亁點也很精巧。至於菜館當然甯波式館子佔多數，徽館，廣東館子也有幾家，煮買西點的祗有「葆山」一家。至於燃料方面，沒有一家是用煤的，因爲煤很缺乏，價格也就高貴，所以都改用炭和炭團，所以上館子去吃東西，在時間上確要費得多。飲水大都天落水，共餘多吃江水，味發鹹性，煮茶至難上口。</p>
<p>住在甯波，房錢也很便宜，所困難的就是恐防空襲；不過自從戰事發生以來，房屋被空襲倒的也有限得很，祗不過　橋一帶熱鬧市區，在去年的四月裏，被狂炸了一陣，現在也已恢復過來。普通民屋大都是假三層樓，中山路一帶最多，差不多家家如此。老式房屋裏，對於客堂房間的油漆，非常精緻，朱紅光漆，非常富麗，甬漆在我國早已馳名的。至於旅館事業自從貨運及往來旅客繁盛以後，也就隨之而畸形的發達起來，像安平旅社等裝有水汀浴缸，設備也很摩登，房金每天在六元以上；至於其他較次旅館，一間雙鋪床的房間，也需二元三四角一天，因爲往來旅客的眾多，也常常客滿着的。</p>
<p>甯波的交通事業，在戰前是公路四通八達，鐵路也可以通達蕭山，可是戰事以後，這些新穎的交通工具都自動的破壞了，對內交通，祗靠水路，所以「快船」和小火輪擔負着運輸上重要工具，有幾處水淺的地方，便靠着古老的交通工具「竹　」來維持運輸。對外，上海開去的輪船，雖不能馳進封鎖綫，然而民船轉駁，也非常便利，因此，甯波在今日依舊是對外內交通上的重要中心。至於甯波本地，人力車，脚踏車也很多，路面在熱鬧市區中，也是柏油馬路，不過比較冷靜一些的，完全用碎石子築成，行走較不便利。</p>
<p>總之，甯波的生活程度確要比孤島來得低，地方情形也是充滿無限朝氣。</p>

<h3>怎樣組織　研究學術團體　可仿照「讀書會」辦法</h3>
<p>— 佛</p>
<p>十二日讀到新亮先生所做「我們怎樣組織讀書會」一文，我便發生了一種感想，這種感想，原是平凡的，並不是一種希奇特別的感想，不過以這種讀書會，還嫌不够，應該把這種讀書會漸漸的大大的擴充罷了。</p>
<p>據新亮先生說：組織讀書會的起因，是由於書價的昂貴，個人的經濟力量，購買力異常薄弱，故用集體購書的辦法，來救濟智識欲的飢荒。這個方法，余百二十分的贊同，惟我更希望把這種讀書會，多多組織，愈多愈妙，團體不必過大，過大則難以管理，人數不必過多，過多則份子難免複雜，祗要二三十人爲一組，多至五六十人爲一組，假定五六十人每人每月會費一元，則每月可購五六十元的書籍，若每人每月會費五角，亦可購二三十元的讀物，其書已大有可觀矣。</p>
<p>近日滬上所多的，便是跳舞塲，影戲院，甚至如滬西之賭塲烟館，所在皆是，而欲覓一硏究學術的團體，則眞如鳳毛麟角之不可多得；即使有之，亦僅有標榜的意義，而乏硏究的精神，換言之，僅有形式上之組織，而無精神之研究，故此種團體，不易發達。我更希望組織此種硏究學術團體，不僅限於購閱書報，更應擴而充之，如書畫。以及詩詞，歌曲，或硏究各種科學者，也應本其所學，照此辦法，大家起來組織這種研究學術的集團。</p>
<p>蓋學術本無止境，愈硏究愈有趣味，愈硏究愈多發明，故馬相伯先生嘗謂，凡一個大學畢業的學生，並不是學業已經成就，乃是學業方纔開始；故一個大學畢業生，正如得了一把書箱的鑰匙，可以把書箱中的書籍，任意硏究。假定得了這把鑰匙，便認爲學業已經滿足，眞是大謬而特謬，這眞是至理名言。我希望現代的靑年，總要將這把鑰匙，向書箱中開看，把書箱中的書籍，放在自己的肚裏，不要將這把鑰匙，掛在身上，做一個金字的招牌，或者做升官發財的敲門磚。</p>
<p>或者謂，現在欲看圖畫小說雜誌等刊物，而合於經濟原理組織的也頗不少。如各書店出租的小說雜誌，或流通圖書館出借的書籍，也是合於經濟原理所組織的，但是要看稍微高深的書籍，或專門的書籍，或者要覓理想中所要看的書籍，尤其研究書畫等等書籍，更不容易租到，眞是彼有書而我不要看，我要看而彼無是書，尙無妥善完滿的租書機關。本來有幾處圖書館，可以去看，然而，現在此種機關，亦少有存在，故組織硏究學術團體，實爲時勢所要求，有志氣的靑年們，或非青年們，應大家起來快快有組織。</p>
<p>我希望孤島上的人們，把消耗於花天酒地，或戲館舞塲賭塲中的時間經濟，拿來消磨在硏究學術之上，化無用爲有用，變浪費爲經濟，其相差不可以道里計。</p>

<p>原來唐惠貞醫師，是一位宗敎家，所以發出了這種議論。可是朱愛人也贊成此說，覺得倘然這人工娠姙法盛行以後，可以說得是個倫常大變。而且她的本位婦孺醫院與育嬰院，只怕還有直接的關係咧。這一回，她們兩人談到這歐美科學家發明人工娠姙法的事，也是偶然談起。所奇者，是談話的却是兩位未出嫁的小姐，未出嫁的小姐而硏究養兒子，眞是中國古書上所說的「未有學養子而后嫁者也」了。但她們的地位，却都應該硏究此事，因爲一位是女科專家，一位是婦院主任，怎麽可以置之不聞不問呢？朱愛人在唐惠貞家裏吃了飯，然後回到旅館裏來，却見何家兩位小姐，也已回到旅館裏了。她們上午也是出去的，她們便是到國際飯店去，訪問那位父執江先生，曾否到上海來咧。她們到國際飯店的賬房間一問，回答是說：「江先生明天到，他已有電報來了，房間也已經定好了。』江先生本來是國際飯店的老主顧，因此一問便知道。何家兩位小姐從國際飯店出來，又去訪問了她們幾位同鄕同學。在外國人中，她們也認識幾位紡織專家。她們現在是要自辦紡織廠了，還要徵求人材來帮助她們，一個紡織廠，也要各種的專門技術家咧。那種紡織廠，旣要熟練的女工，又要熟練的技師。自由村當然招不到那些熟練的女工，那是不能不預先籌備的。好在上海有好幾家高等紡織學校，與紡織技術人員養成所，都是培養紡織人材的。高等紡織學校，可以造成技師，養成所也所以造成各種紡織工人。她們想：將來她們的那個紡織廠成立以後，便在廠址的近傍，也要設立一個紡織人員養成所。因爲中國紡織事業，日益發達，將來各處需要紡織人員，亦必增多，而人材勢必缺乏。就是自己廠裏，也必定每年要添新技師與新工人呀。大概她們的紡織廠，設立在自由村，勢必從上海招不少的技師與工人去，這是可以斷言的。恐怕到了臨時急促，却是此刻就要預備了。這高等紡織學校中的敎師，何家兩位小姐也有認得的，因此也要去訪問他們一下，叨敎叨敎。　（二二七）</p>

<h3>報販訪問記</h3>
<p>— 曾楨</p>
<p>生平的嗜好，就是唯一的書，但是書價這樣貴，窮小子們祇能在書攤裏瞎翻，或流連於報攤上了。</p>
<p>在常常碰面之後，對於報販當然要熟悉起來了，下面就是與某一個報販去談話，無以名之，就算牠訪問記吧。</p>
<p>我本來也並不是有心要找他談話，這動機是見到他後發生的，因爲我看他並不像一個普通的報販：身子修長，不過瘦削了些，身上是破舊的西裝，脚上是與底快脫離關係的破皮鞋，長長的面孔，很有淸秀之氣；而且在我走近報攤的時候，他是在看書，看的書是「××經濟學」。</p>
<p>我就在書架上取了一本雜誌，胡亂地翻了一會，他也對我看了一眼，於是我就搭訕地問他。。</p>
<p>「這雜誌有折扣嗎？」</p>
<p>「先生，這雜誌要照實價賣，因爲自己買來，祇打八折。」他和靄地解釋，絕沒有不高興的樣子，而且他的話非常坦白直率，我繼續問他：</p>
<p>「能不能稍减去價鈿？」</p>
<p>「不能了，因爲照實價，我們已經不能賺多少錢。」</p>
<p>「這雜誌每期能銷去多少份？」</p>
<p>「十份之內；能銷去十份的已不多。」</p>
<p>「什麼雜誌銷路最好？」</p>
<p>「電影之類！」</p>
<p>「像現在紙張這樣貴，各種雜誌差不多漲了一倍，買的人更其少了。所以現在書架上的雜誌，大多要打回票退去的。」他感慨地說，而且很有憂慮之色。</p>
<p>「那末你每天可賺多少錢呢？」我同情地問。</p>
<p>「難能維持生活！」他苦惱</p>
<p>「那末爲什麼幹賣報呢？」</p>
<p>「沒有別事可做呀！」</p>
<p>我於是細細地同他談。他吿訴他是一個受過初中敎育的學生，就在上海的附近一個縣內。他父親是當一個關機的職員，不過自從砲火起了之後，他的家就完了，父親母親都杳無音訊，他就孤獨地流離到孤島，在做報販的境况下過活。不過他說，只要有機會，他就要脫離這裏，不願把自己的志氣沉落。</p>
<p>最後，我就向他買了一本雜誌，慢慢地踱回家。</p>

<h3>Internal and External Pressures Expose Incompetence: The Abe Cabinet Finally Collapses; Mitsumasa Yonai Receives Mandate to Form New Cabinet; Navy Minister Yoshida Retains Post, Foreign Minister Arita</h3>
<p>Tokyo - The Abe Cabinet held an emergency cabinet meeting this morning at 9:13 AM and decided to resign en masse. Prime Minister Abe then went to the palace at 9:45 AM to submit the resignation letters of all cabinet members. (Fourteenth, Domei News Agency)</p>
<p>Hong Kong - Tokyo dispatch: Former Navy Minister and Military Councilor Mitsumasa Yonai was summoned to the palace at 7:15 PM today and received an imperial edict to form a new cabinet. Yonai replied, requesting time to organize the new cabinet, and then withdrew. Earlier, at 6:40 PM this afternoon, Minister of the Imperial Household Yuasa entered the palace to meet with the Emperor and recommended Yonai for the premiership. The Emperor then summoned Yonai to the palace and issued the mandate to form a cabinet. Army Minister Hata Shunroku also entered the palace at 7:55 PM this afternoon to meet with the Emperor. (Fourteenth dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo - General Mitsumasa Yonai, having received the imperial mandate to form a cabinet, left the palace at 8:05 PM this afternoon and immediately went to the Prime Minister's official residence to begin preparations. At the same time, he requested Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, former Finance Minister Sotaro Ishiwata, and others to gather at the residence. (Fourteenth, Domei News Agency)</p>
<p>Tokyo - Former Welfare Minister Hisatada Hirose joined the cabinet formation headquarters at 9:40 PM this afternoon. (Fourteenth, Domei News Agency)</p>
<p>Tokyo - Hachiro Arita will assume the position of Foreign Minister in the new cabinet, while Navy Minister Yoshida will remain in his original post. Furthermore, former Finance Minister Sotaro Ishiwata has been decided upon as the Chief Cabinet Secretary. (Fourteenth, Domei News Agency)</p>
<p>Tokyo - The current Governor of the Bank of Japan, Toyotaro Yuki, is the most highly touted candidate for Finance Minister in the new cabinet. (Fourteenth, Domei News Agency)</p>
<p>Konoe Firmly Declines, Seeking a Secondary Choice</p>
<p>Tokyo - Minister of the Imperial Household Yuasa bears the weighty responsibility of recommending a successor to the Emperor. Therefore, he is soliciting opinions from all sides, considering Prince Fumimaro Konoe as the number one candidate. He is earnestly requesting Konoe to come forward and resolve the current situation. However, Konoe's mindset remains unchanged, forcing the work of selecting a successor to the premiership to consider a second step. (Fourteenth, Domei News Agency)</p>
<p>Tokyo - Minister of the Imperial Household Yuasa convened a meeting of senior statesmen in the palace at 11:00 AM this morning to inquire about their intentions. As a result, it was decided to recommend Military Councilor and Navy Admiral Mitsumasa Yonai to form a cabinet. An internal affairs official, Chief Secretary Matsudaira, was dispatched on the 2:23 PM train departing from Tokyo this afternoon to Okitsu to visit Saionji, conveying Minister Yuasa's intentions and soliciting the Duke's opinion. After receiving the Duke's opinion, he reported it to the Imperial Household Ministry by telephone. Thereupon, Minister Yuasa entered the palace at 6:40 PM to pay homage to the Emperor, declaring that General Mitsumasa Yonai was the most suitable person to assume the leadership of the succeeding cabinet. (Fourteenth, Domei)</p>
<p>Abe's Statement Explaining Reasons for Resignation</p>
<p>Tokyo - This morning, Abe issued the following statement to reporters: "Since forming the cabinet last August, I have strived to handle domestic and foreign affairs, with the handling of the China Incident as the main objective. However, it has become apparent that opinions regarding the implementation of the government's established policies and plans have not been consistent. Therefore, I have submitted the resignation of the entire cabinet to the Emperor in order to avoid a standstill in the government during this critical time and to prevent possible repercussions in the handling of the China Incident, which has entered its first phase." (Fourteenth, Reuters)</p>
<p>Speculation on Political Trends of the New Cabinet</p>
<p>Tokyo - The sudden appointment of General Mitsumasa Yonai to the premiership has surprised most people. Yonai had previously served as Navy Minister in the cabinets of Kiichiro Hiranuma and Prince Fumimaro Konoe. Within the Abe Nobuyuki cabinet, the navy already had three members, wielding considerable influence. Now, instead of appointing Army Minister Hata Shunroku to form the cabinet, Yonai has been chosen as Prime Minister, making it easy to predict one or two political trends. Sources in Tokyo point out that the Japanese Navy is attempting to seek understanding with Britain and the United States, paying particular attention to the United States. They also note that Japanese newspapers had not mentioned Yonai as a candidate for successor to the premiership until this morning, which seems to be significant. (Fourteenth, Haitong News Agency)</p>
<p>Tokyo - According to tonight's news, the Emperor has appointed Navy Admiral Mitsumasa Yonai to form the succeeding cabinet. The previous report that General Hata Shunroku had been ordered to form the cabinet has proven to be inaccurate. The Abe cabinet, following Konoe and Hiranuma, shouldered the heavy responsibility of continuing to strengthen the wartime economy of a quasi-totalitarian state. Due to the lack of achievement and mismanagement of the various cabinet members, people of all classes, including capitalists, industrialists, bureaucrats, politicians, and the general public, have become increasingly dissatisfied. The Abe cabinet was thus forced to resign after a majority of members of the House of Representatives declared their opposition. If the Abe cabinet had used the means of dissolving the Diet to suppress the opposition, the passage of the massive one billion yen budget would have been significantly delayed. There are also many indications that the results of the general election would show the opposition to the cabinet in the House of Representatives to be even stronger than it is now. The entire nation of Japan now expects a strong and extraordinary statesman to emerge and correct the mistakes of the previous three cabinets. (Fourteenth, Reuters)</p>
<p>Chongqing's Observation of the Japanese Political Situation</p>
<p>Chongqing - According to Chinese sources familiar with the Japanese political situation, the new Japanese cabinet that will follow the Abe cabinet will inevitably be a military junta. Its power will inevitably be greater than that of the bureaucratic regime that has resigned. The Japanese Abe cabinet was the weakest and most useless cabinet of the Japanese wartime cabinets. The complexion of the new cabinet will inevitably tend more towards young military personnel, and thus its military actions against China will inevitably become more aggressive. The weakness of the Abe cabinet lies in its incompetence. Although there was no shortage of "American experts" such as Kaku Murata and Admiral Nomura Kichisaburo in the Abe cabinet, relations between Japan and the United States ultimately failed to improve and could only await the expiration of the U.S.-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation. At the same time, the Abe cabinet also failed to promote relations between the Soviet Union and Japan. In fact, since the outbreak of the European war, due to the increased friendship between the Soviet Union and Germany, there was a good opportunity to improve Soviet-Japanese relations, but Abe missed this opportunity. Furthermore, Abe failed to resolve the "China Incident" and failed to establish Wang Jingwei's "rule" at an early date. The only achievement of the Abe cabinet was the conclusion of the Soviet-Japanese Fisheries Agreement, but in general, this agreement was purely technical and not very important. Domestically, Abe faced two major difficulties: (1) The rice riots in major and minor cities in Japan, which showed the economic difficulties in Japan, and (2) the collective resignation of officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which has completely destroyed the dignity of the Abe cabinet. In the end, the new government that arises in Japan will inevitably be a more powerful military junta, but if Japan's military actions against China become more aggressive, China's resistance to Japan will inevitably become stronger.

<h3>Brief Biography of Yonai</h3>
<p>Tokyo - The new Prime Minister Yonai is currently sixty years old and is from Iwate Prefecture. He graduated from the Naval Academy in the 34th year of Meiji (1901) and later became a naval ensign. He progressively rose in rank, reaching the rank of naval vice admiral in the 5th year of Showa (1930). During that time, he served as the captain of various warships such as the "Kasuga," "Iwate," "Fuso," and "Mutsu." He also served as the Chief of Staff of the Second Fleet, the Commander of the Chinkai Naval Base, the Commander of the First Overseas Expeditionary Fleet, assigned to the Naval General Staff, the Commander of the Third Fleet, the Commander of the Sasebo Naval Base, and the Commander of the Combined Fleet. He assumed the position of Navy Minister when the Hayashi cabinet was formed in the 12th year of Showa (1937). He later became a Military Councilor until today. (Fourteenth, Domei News Agency)</p>
<h3>Various Sectors in Japan Place High Hopes on the New Cabinet; Establishing Domestic Order Is Considered a Matter of Urgent Necessity</h3>
<p>Tokyo - This morning, newspapers generally advocated the formation of a strong cabinet that not only enjoys the trust of the Imperial Court but also the support of the people. Most newspapers strongly argued that the new cabinet should prioritize domestic affairs, especially those concerning agriculture and industry, as this is necessary for waging a long-term war. The "Asahi Shimbun" stated that the new cabinet should first establish domestic order, otherwise any attempt at foreign policy in Manchuria will inevitably fail. (Fourteenth, Haitong News Agency)</p>
<p>Tokyo - The Japanese industrial sector has shown extremely favorable feelings towards the emergence of the Yonai cabinet. The issues that remain are which figures will be in charge of the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. However, if one infers from the personality of General Yonai and the forces behind him, the policies will definitely be fairly stable. Therefore, various parties are very eager to cooperate with the political parties in handling foreign affairs and assisting the new cabinet in managing rear-area matters. Here is a summary of the hopes of the financial community for the Yonai cabinet: (1) The first problem to solve is restoring the political authority lost by the previous cabinet. (2) Domestic economic controls regarding price issues and materials issues should be properly managed with responsibility. (3) Regarding foreign affairs, especially trade policies, it is imperative to respect the full opinions of private sector operators to ensure smooth operation. (Fourteenth, Domei News Agency)</p>
<h3>A Review of Abe's Achievements After Four and a Half Months in Power</h3>
<p>Japanese Prime Minister Kiichiro Hiranuma, due to his policy of strengthening the Anti-Comintern Pact, felt uneasy in his position after Hitler turned his back on Japan and approached the Soviet Union. General Abe took the stage on August 30 of last year, assuming the position of Prime Minister. This was one week after the Soviet Union and Germany concluded an agreement, and two days after the outbreak of the European War. General Abe had no notable reputation and had been retired for three years. People generally believed that because he had been living in seclusion for so long, he would have no grudges or enemies, and his cabinet formation would not cause much controversy. In addition, the military supported him, and he was related to Prince Konoe's confidant, Marquis Kido (his eldest son married the Marquis's daughter). All of these were favorable conditions for forming a cabinet at the time. This is the story of how General Abe came to be appointed Prime Minister.</p>
<p>Only Achievement at the Beginning of His Tenure</p>
<p>At the beginning of his tenure, he temporarily held the position of Foreign Minister while also being Prime Minister, and on September 5, he issued a statement that Japan would not participate in the European War. Subsequently, on September 16, a cease-fire agreement was reached with the Soviet Union regarding the Nomonhan Incident. All of this was welcomed by Japanese public opinion. Especially in the case of the Nomonhan Incident, as a result of repeated clashes between Japanese and Soviet forces, a total of 18,000 Japanese soldiers were killed. This was only announced by the Japanese government on October 4.</p>
<p>Military Failure: A Major Blow</p>
<p>Prime Minister Abe then appointed Navy Admiral Kichisaburo Nomura as Foreign Minister on October 23 to strengthen the cabinet. He then adopted a "three-pronged offensive": Firstly, a military offensive against China. The Japanese army began attacking Changsha, but never entered the city. Later, the Japanese side explained that there was no intention to do so, only to "punish" the Chinese army. Secondly, a domestic offensive. Prime Minister Abe, in view of the fact that the Army and Navy Ministers had the right to directly meet with the Emperor at any time to report on various cabinet affairs, which allowed them to compete with the Prime Minister within the cabinet, attempted to reform the system and abolish this right. However, the results were never announced. It is said that restrictions were only placed on the handling of the "China Incident." Regarding other public affairs, the Army and Navy Ministers could still enter the palace at any time. Thirdly, an offensive against bureaucratic politics. Prime Minister Abe, disregarding the opposition of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, attempted to establish a Ministry of Commerce, which led to a unified opposition from all officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who resisted by "diplomatic slowdown." After several days, on October 13, the Abe cabinet finally yielded. Its weakness and incompetence were thus fully exposed. After suffering repeated failures in the above three offensives, the Abe cabinet switched to a defensive posture, but various blows continued to follow.</p>
<p>No Achievements in Diplomacy or Domestic Affairs</p>
<p>U.S. Ambassador to Japan Joseph Grew delivered a speech at the American Club in Tokyo on October 19 of last year, warning Japan that what U.S. public opinion expected was "facts, not empty words." This was the first blow suffered by the Abe cabinet. Subsequently, the leaders of the two major political parties, the Seiyukai and Minseito, refused to join the cabinet on November 21. This was the second blow. However, it is generally believed that the main reason for the deterioration of the political situation was domestic economic instability. For example, some areas of Japan were facing rice shortages, and in the northern regions, Kyushu, and Korea, there were even rumors of rice riots. In addition, there was also a shortage of charcoal, a daily necessity for Japanese families. It is said that the insufficient supply of both rice and charcoal was not due to a fundamental lack of supply, but to uneven distribution. As a result, rice prices soared, and the general public was greatly shaken. The public believed that the cabinet's policy of trying to suppress the prices of various necessities had failed. The cabinet initially claimed to suppress prices, but then, unable to suppress them, changed to stabilizing prices at the current level. In the end, however, it was unable to stabilize them and changed to revising prices according to "fair standards." In addition, the budget passed on December 8 of last year, totaling over one trillion yen, was an unprecedentedly large budget. It is expected that in order to cope with this huge expenditure, the government will inevitably raise tax rates and continue to pursue inflationary policies.</p>
<p>Attempts to Reverse the Decline Ultimately Unsuccessful</p>
<p>When the House of Representatives reconvened on December 26, over 200 members of various parties passed a resolution in an informal meeting, demanding Abe's resignation. Although Japanese political parties have not held a decisive position in national political life for the past ten years, the actions of these members were sufficient to prove that the general public was increasingly dissatisfied with the weakness and incompetence of the Abe cabinet. Under these circumstances, the Abe cabinet attempted to make a final struggle in diplomacy in order to reverse the decline, but was ultimately unsuccessful. For example, on December 31 of last year, the Japanese government concluded a temporary agreement with the Soviet Union on the fisheries issue, thereby showing that the two countries were adjusting their relations. This was one thing. The Japanese government announced the opening of the lower Yangtze River in order to appease U.S. public opinion and pave the way for improving relations between the two sides. This was another thing. However, the tense domestic political situation did not ease as a result. Furthermore, in terms of military affairs, although the Japanese army had captured Nanning City in Guangxi Province, China, several weeks ago, it did nothing to stabilize the cabinet's position.</p>
<p>After the beginning of the new year, government authorities held meetings with representatives of the Japanese army stationed in China (Lieutenant General Itagaki Seishiro, Chief of Staff of the Expeditionary Army, also flew back to Tokyo from China to participate). They discussed the "Wang Jingwei New Regime." However, after the completion of these preliminary talks, Army Minister Hata Shunroku, the spokesman for the military, publicly stated that the military hoped that the Prime Minister would resign. The Abe cabinet therefore finally collapsed. (Havas News Agency)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Abe's Fall and Japanese Politics</h3>
<p>The Japanese Abe cabinet finally proved unable to sustain itself and carried out a collective resignation yesterday morning. It has been difficult to select a successor to the premiership. It was not until late last night that it was learned that former Navy Minister Yonai had been ordered to form a cabinet. Whether the new cabinet can be successfully formed, what the lineup of cabinet members will be, and what policy direction it will take are all unknown. Since China launched its full-scale resistance, Japan has changed its prime minister four times. The Konoe cabinet lasted the longest, for nineteen months. The Hiranuma cabinet was very brief, lasting eight months. The Abe cabinet was formed on August 30 of last year, and lasted only four and a half months, an extremely short cabinet tenure.</p>
<p>The fall of the Konoe cabinet was due to the failure of the peace offensive against China. The fall of the Hiranuma cabinet was mainly due to strengthening the anti-communist pact of Germany, Italy and Japan, but ultimately being betrayed by Germany. As for Abe, his fall is almost bewildering and bizarre. It is still remembered that at the beginning of Abe's ascent to power, we once commented on his essence based on the clues he revealed, calling him "unprecedentedly poor and empty." Regarding his hopes, we judged him to be "inherently deficient from birth and imbalanced later in life, unable to accomplish anything and without any future prospects. He can be said to have been doomed from the moment he was born." Now, upon examination, we are secretly glad that our previous comments were somewhat accurate. Abe achieved nothing and had no solutions for Japan's military actions against China, its international diplomacy, or its domestic economy. Compared to the general situation four or five months ago, everything in Japan today has only deteriorated. However, there are things that cannot be completely dismissed. During the Hiranuma cabinet, Japan was loudly boasting about joining forces with Germany and Italy to constrain Britain and France. When Germany engaged with the Soviet Union, Japan was suddenly isolated internationally. Abe succeeded him, and less than twenty days later, the Soviet-Japanese Nomonhan ceasefire agreement was signed, and recently, the Soviet-Japanese fisheries issue was resolved. This was something Hiranuma was unable to do, but Abe achieved it through effort. However, given Japan's international environment in the past four or five months, Germany launched a large-scale invasion of Poland, Britain and France declared war to assist Poland and restrain Germany, the Soviet Union was determined to act in Northern Europe, the world was in turmoil, and the United States was reserved. This was truly an excellent environment for Japan to change course, extricate itself from the quagmire, compensate through trade, and restore its international position. However, it was unable to come up with a plan and ultimately ended up as it is today. Is it not due to those who bear the heavy responsibility of the nation to shoulder the nation's reliance? Regarding the Soviet border disputes and fisheries issues, matters of the utmost insignificance, it is more accurate to say that the Soviet Union granted them to Abe.</p>
<p>It was inevitable that Abe would not be able to remain in his position for long due to his inherent and acquired poverty and emptiness. However, it is not in accordance with the usual course of events for him to collapse at this moment. Why is this said? If the collapse was in response to the general international situation, then the European War broke out just two days after Abe formed his cabinet. This was something Abe could not have anticipated when he was ordered to form his cabinet. It would have been an unusual but not extraordinary event to reorganize the cabinet at that time to adapt to the dramatic changes. If the collapse was in response to the U.S.-Japan antagonism, then it was generally known that there was a five-month distance between Abe's formation of the cabinet and the expiration of the treaty. There was ample time to seek a remedy. Now, with only ten days left before the expiration, this is precisely an important moment for countries and politicians with firm national policies to solemnly prepare for the event. Why did Abe procrastinate until the last day? If the collapse was in response to the so-called "China Incident" in Japan, the essence of Japan's policy of establishing a so-called new central government is not worth discussing here. However, Japan has claimed that this is an immutable policy, so why did the prime minister leave a few days after deciding on these "conditions"? In short, although the Abe cabinet was said to be a cabinet with no prospects from the beginning, its fall today is all the more perplexing because it fell without knowing its main cause. This type of cabinet tide is unprecedented in the political history of Japan and other countries.</p>
<p>Examining Abe's final statement, there is a sentence that says, "I have made handling the China Incident the main goal, but there has been no consensus on the opinions regarding the implementation of the government's established policies and plans, which is now apparent." Therefore, he has resigned to avoid possible repercussions. Thus, one might speculate that the collapse of the Abe cabinet was only a technical issue under the policy of handling the so-called China Incident. However, is that credible? Abe's "policy of handling the China Incident" was based on the Konoe Declaration. Abe was unable to win, only Konoe could. While Abe was on the verge of collapse, Konoe was the only one whom the Japanese military, government, and public unanimously respected. Therefore, Konoe had a duty that he could not shirk! However, Konoe declined, saying, "I believe that my economic knowledge is insufficient to be of assistance. My conscience dictates that I am unable to assume the heavy responsibility of resolving the current situation. Moreover, the future political situation will not be based on lineage." Thus, it can be seen that the problem is not a technical issue of promoting the policy towards China, nor is it only a problem of the policy towards China. The problem is in the economy, which seems close to the truth. However, 260 Diet members pressured Abe based on the hardships of the people they had witnessed in various regions, but Abe remained unmoved. He was ultimately forced to leave because of one word from Army Minister Hata Shunroku. Abe's successor is not an economic authority, but Navy Admiral Yonai. Therefore, the economy is still not the main theme, which is even more perplexing?</p>
<p>Due to the above reasons, it is said that Abe's fall is bewildering and bizarre. What is so strange about it? He failed to measure his own abilities, and recklessly engaged in military aggression for two and a half years, resulting in exhaustion of strength, depletion of wealth, fatigue of troops, and resentment among the people. He knew that he could not continue and that he had to fundamentally change his national policy. However, he was misled by the exaggerated education of the past and the false propaganda of past years, leading the lower levels of the military and civilians astray, making it difficult to reverse course. However, there is no statesman with great knowledge and courage who dares to bear the resentment of the moment and forcefully correct the wrongs of aggression. Heavy members are only struggling in the dead end of military, diplomatic, and economic matters. Is their hesitation and sorrow any different?</p>
<h3>German Forces to Launch Offensive on the Western Front Within Three Months; Willing to Attack Neutral Countries If Necessary; German Troops Along the Dutch Border Deploying Northward</h3>
<p>London - Lord Milner, a member of Parliament, recently published an article in the Sunday Chronicle, stating that within the next three months, Hitler will launch a nationwide offensive on the Western Front in order to break through the lines of Britain and France. If necessary, he will not hesitate to attack neutral countries. In order to overcome current difficulties, Hitler must launch a large-scale offensive as soon as possible. If he delays, he will inevitably lose the opportunity completely. In other words, Hitler must achieve a military victory or he will be unable to save himself. Therefore, he has no other good strategy than to take a gamble. (Fourteenth, Havas)</p>
<p>Rotterdam - According to German sources cited in a report from the Dutch border by a Rotterdam newspaper, Germany is currently imposing large-scale restrictions on domestic passenger trains. This move is likely a sign of major military activity. According to the general expectation of the German people, military action will definitely occur once the weather clears. The concentration of German troops along the Dutch border, which used to be limited to the vicinity of Coesfeld, is now extending northward. Therefore, the town of Gronau in Westphalia is full of German troops, and the town's train station is now closed to trains. The German people are showing anxiety and unease because German newspapers and radio stations are not publishing important world news. (Fourteenth, Reuters)</p>
<p>The Hague - Due to the concentration of German troops along the Dutch border, the Dutch military authorities have decided to issue an order to cancel all leave for officers and soldiers, and those who are currently on leave are being recalled. (Fourteenth, Havas)</p>
<p>The Hague - In recent days, German troops have moved closer to the Netherlands, and German aircraft have also violated Dutch airspace. The Dutch army yesterday deployed to important strongholds in the Nijmegen area to prevent any eventuality. The Dutch cabinet held a cabinet meeting this afternoon to discuss the international situation. (Fourteenth, Havas)</p>
<p>London - The Sunday Chronicle recently reported that German leader Hitler has formulated a plan with Foreign Minister Ribbentrop regarding the country's "war aims." In essence, these are the peace terms that the country intends to propose to Britain and France after its eventual victory. The detailed contents will be announced in a short period of time. In general, there are six points: (1) Britain and France should cede all of their colonies in Africa to Germany. (2) France should cede the provinces of Alsace and Lorraine to Germany. (3) Britain and France should pay Germany a large indemnity, totaling 400 billion pounds. (4) Britain should sign a commercial treaty with Germany that includes a most-favored-nation clause, which should also apply to their respective colonies, including India. (5) Britain and France should grant Germany certain special concessions in finance, so as to ensure that Germany maintains political and economic dominance. (6) France should sign an alliance treaty with Germany for a term of 25 years. (Fourteenth, Havas)</p>
<h3>法海長陳述　協約國海上戰績　商業獲得自由　使德海外貿易銷滅於無形　德警告中立船勿受英護送</h3>
<p>Paris. The French Minister of the Navy, Guesthart, yesterday published an article describing the remarkable achievements of the Allied Powers at sea in the four months since the start of the war, stating that the Allied Powers have achieved freedom for their commerce and rendered German overseas trade virtually extinct. Furthermore, 400 German ships dare not leave neutral ports. The French Navy alone has sunk 10 German submarines, inspected 239 merchant ships, and intercepted 622,000 tons of goods bound for Germany. Apart from the Baltic Sea, Allied routes are completely open as usual. Large armies have arrived from the colonies without a single loss. Over 1,300 Allied ships and more than 200 merchant convoys have safely crossed the sea under the escort of French warships. The Allied Powers have collectively sunk approximately 30 German submarines, and French warships have suffered no losses. A total of 11 French merchant ships have been lost, 7 of which were sunk by German submarines. The number of losses is approximately 2% of the total number of French merchant ships in September. French shipyards are currently actively building 126 warships. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>

<p>Berlin. The German Foreign Office mouthpiece, "Deutsche Aussenpolitische Revue", warned neutral ships today, stating that if neutral ships are influenced by British propaganda and escorted by British warships, they will automatically become participating units and may encounter the danger of war. This is a trick by Britain to drag neutral countries into the European war, and it is hoped that all neutral countries will be careful not to fall into their trap.

<h3>日對外貿易　畸形發展　對「非日金集團」　仍居於入超地位</h3>
<p>Tokyo. According to official statistics released a few days ago, Japan's foreign trade increased significantly last year, totaling 7,006 million Japanese Yen, an increase of 23% compared to the previous year. Imports increased by 10% compared to the previous year, and exports increased by 36%. The total surplus was 800 million Japanese Yen, an increase of 740 million Japanese Yen compared to the previous year's surplus. However, according to experts, although the surplus is large, not all of it can actually be converted into foreign currency. This is because Japan's foreign trade partners must be divided into two different groups: one is the "Yen Bloc", including "Manchukuo" and the occupied areas of China, and the other is the "Non-Yen Bloc". Japan's trade with the countries of the "Non-Yen Bloc" can be called "true foreign trade". If we analyze the overall trade situation of Japan last year, most of the imported goods came from these countries, while the exports of Japanese goods to these countries accounted for more than half of the total. In other words, Japan actually had a trade deficit of approximately 500 million Japanese Yen with the countries of the "Non-Yen Bloc". From this, it can be seen that although Japan has an overall trade surplus, it still has a trade deficit with the countries of the "Non-Yen Bloc". It is naturally conceivable that it cannot fully exchange export goods for foreign currency. Furthermore, the main reason for the surge in Japan's foreign trade last year was the high global prices. Often, the trading volume of certain goods did not increase, but due to soaring prices, the total value increased sharply compared to the past. For example, the export volume of Japanese silk last year, calculated in terms of quantity, actually increased by 20%. The same is true for Japan's import of raw cotton. In addition, the Japanese government's strict control of the domestic economy has been quite effective in improving the trade balance, because the government has made every effort to limit domestic consumption in order to export more goods abroad. (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>Washington Shipping News. The Department of Commerce recently announced that the manufacturers of rayon in Japan relied on the countries of the Scandinavian Peninsula for the supply of fibers. Due to the European war, they have switched to purchasing from the United States. It is also reported that the Japanese rayon industry has obtained government approval to order 30,000 tons from the United States and Canada. The deepening dependence of the Japanese economy on the United States due to the impact of the European war can be clearly demonstrated here. (Havas Agency)</p>

<h3>美遠東政策的透視</h3>
<p>Since the Soviet Union and Japan signed a truce agreement last September, and then Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov in October Revolution Anniversary speech said pro-Japanese, Japan and the Soviet Union will be conducted business negotiations, rampant, the United States for the Far East situation because it is becoming increasingly concerned, the general concern people from the inquiry, the Far East of the Soviet Union and Japan is as good as the Nazi and Soviet countries, carve up China, Guoer then the Open Door policy and traditional U.S. interests will be how.</p>
<p>The U.S. government at least has made it clear that any rights in China, will not frankly automatically give up. The United States will not be for these rights war, but in the "war outside" there are other ways to express indignation. This month on the 26th, the U.S. and Japan commercial treaty will expire, and now have not taken concrete steps to negotiate a new commercial treaty or interim measures. The implication is that, by the 26th of this month, Japan will not enjoy U.S. Secretary of State Hull and twenty-two countries ordered reciprocal trade agreement provides the tax cuts. Its own meaning a kind of punishment, Congress and the majority of members advocated the passage of a ban on arms and raw materials to Japan bill, this action in the U.S. and Japan existing commercial treaty abolished after the can be legally implemented. The State Department has also decided attitude, the United States rights in China Gou not get protection, that is, not with Japan to negotiate a new commercial treaty. The U.S. position in China has long been the United States and China legitimate government signed various treaties various agreements, be confirmed, not to recognize the third party Japan has the right to change or modify.</p>
<p>U.S. to Japan's attitude will not because the Soviet Union and to the Far East attention and the slightest soft. Japan and the Soviet Union's every move, the United States is regarded as a jackal of the same burrow. The U.S. government authorities condemn the Soviet Union is with condemnation of Nazi Germany as severe. The three countries there is nothing great understanding, but in the U.S. eyes, are in violation of international law of the country. The United States is not willing in the three countries, pull one to contain the other. The U.S. for the Far East situation can be said to no longer be in maintaining balance. Previously the U.S. often help Russia to contain Japan, or to help Japan to contain Russia. The U.S. in 1933 recognized the Soviet Union is also contained meaning of Japan. The two countries Gou there is a country too strong, the U.S. often against the country developed. In 1899, Russia's economic influence into Manchuria, is to promote the Open Door policy is a main reason. Until the last war after the United States sent troops to Siberia is to curb Japan's ambitions. The U.S. history for the two countries Japan and Russia is that so. Now have this traditional policy abandoned. By recently, the Soviet Union for Finland's attitude, the United States both sternly condemned, the Soviet Union's newspapers also counter each other. The Soviet Union Embassy in the United States celebrated the October Revolution Anniversary, U.S. Cabinet and senators surprisingly no one participated, only by the State Department Soviet Division sent a second to attend perfunctorily, the U.S. dissatisfaction with the Soviet Union's emotions is evident.</p>
<p>If the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany relations, the United States is to note the Soviet Union and Japan relations, rather than for the Soviet Union and Germany relations, but also recognize the two sides not without parallel the original element exist in it. U.S. Undersecretary of State Mays Smith recently reviewed foreign policy, although not referred to the Soviet Union, but the Far East will be a detailed statement. He addressed the Washington Treaty would say, "in recent years, these treaties have been because of the Far East of the unfortunate events suffered significant impact. The U.S. government still be obliged to abide by these treaties of the objectives, the spirit and the provisions ...... any revision must be based on these treaties of the original text, taking into account U.S. interests, in accordance with international law of the procedures established to do, can not be by any country of unilateral actions out of it ...... domestic part of the people advocated the U.S. foreign policy of the basic principles temporarily shelved, until the rapidly changing international situation after stable and then set advance and retreat. International stage of the new combination or not to need our country policy revision overhaul. I for this claim dare firmly answer, other countries between what combination, the U.S. nation will never give up its basic principles ...... foreign group what change, the U.S. will never revoke the international relations should be in order progress of the claim." However, the United States is prepared to be the advocate for the judge, but is not willing to be the executor. This layer, Mays Smith Undersecretary has also been added to the description.

<h3>蔣委員長夫婦購買　節約建國儲蓄券　潘公展談節約儲蓄之正確性</h3>
<p>Chongqing. Because the "Frugality and Nation-Building Savings Certificates" are currently being widely promoted, which is directly related to the needs of people's livelihood adjustment and indirectly helps the completion of national construction undertakings, Chairman Chiang and his wife recently purchased savings certificates for several thousand yuan respectively to demonstrate their advocacy. (14th dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing. Pan Gongzhan, Deputy Minister of the Central Propaganda Department and Standing Committee Member of the National Frugality and Nation-Building Savings Movement Committee, recently spoke to reporters about the correctness of frugality and savings. According to him, the government's establishment of "Frugality and Nation-Building Savings" during the Anti-Japanese War and Nation-Building period has two functions: (1) In a passive sense, it can cultivate national habits of thrift and frugality, and economize on waste, as a preparation for the improvement of personal and family life. (2) In an active sense, frugality can create capital consumption for production, improve the national economy, and strengthen the power of the Anti-Japanese War. Last year, the government promulgated "Frugality and Nation-Building Savings", designating the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Farmers Bank, and Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau to handle it. Other public and private banks that are guaranteed by the Ministry of Finance can also handle it. Currently, the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank, as well as the trust bureau of the Central Bank, have all opened for business. It is said that the results are still good. As for the "Frugality and Nation-Building Savings Certificates", the government has promulgated regulations, designating the Central Trust Bureau, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Farmers Bank, and the Postal Savings Bureau to handle them. This savings certificate originated in the United States. During the last European war, it was called "War Savings Certificate" and was the best method for promoting small-amount savings. In the United Kingdom at that time, the effect was very good, absorbing an amount of 300 to 400 million pounds, which was extremely effective for wartime economy and stabilizing the post-war economy. Our country is imitating it, which is of great significance. This savings certificate has now been issued by the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, and the Central Trust Bureau has also prepared for it. It is said that it will also be issued within this month, and the Central Bank has been requested to allocate an independent fund of 10 million yuan as a guarantee. The other three banks, the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank, are also preparing to issue them. This savings certificate is absolutely different in nature from various public bonds and various securities. Its principal and interest can be repaid in a short period of time. On the national level, under the principle of fulfilling responsibility and serving the country, we enjoy the preferential rights of savings. On the national level, we can concentrate funds and use them for various construction undertakings. This is the correctness of frugality and nation-building, and it is an unprecedented and excellent opportunity in our country's history. We deeply hope that the people of the country will not easily miss it. (14th dispatch)</p>

However, they were blocked by the Japanese army. Later, the Ping headquarters negotiated with the Japanese army stationed in Ping, but was unreasonably rejected. Forced to do so, Ambassador Carl again requested the Japanese (Ambassador Kato) to allow the employees to go to Ping. Many days have passed since then, and the employees have still been unable to leave Yu. Recently, Ambassador Carl formally wrote to Kato again, reiterating the previous situation. Therefore, this dispute has not been resolved, and the many British nationals trapped in Jiaozuo are still unable to escape the dangerous situation. (Dispatch, 13th)</p>

<h3>Close Cooperation Between German and Soviet Troops on Polish Border Arouses French Attention</h3>
<p>Paris, according to reliable French sources, there is now close cooperation between the German and Soviet military authorities in the Ukrainian region of Poland. This is currently receiving a great deal of attention here. News from Germany about Germany possibly mediating the Soviet-Finnish war has led people here to question whether this German suggestion is aimed at getting the Soviet Union to abandon northwestern Europe and shift its activities to the southwest. Until recently, the Soviet army had been exclusively guarding certain parts of Poland, preventing Germany from establishing a common border with Romania. The export of Romanian oil to Germany was therefore difficult. But at present, German troops have entered the Ukrainian region of Poland, and a German military mission is also active in Moscow. Therefore, people here believe that this is a sign of close German-Soviet military cooperation. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>
<h3>Belgium Requisitions Workers to Undertake National Defense Work, Cancels Military Leave</h3>
<p>Brussels, the most important feature of the new national defense measures taken by the Belgian government is said to be the requisition of some workers to undertake national defense work. Although a small number of troops have been recalled, it is widely believed that only a small part of the national defense measures are of a purely military nature. Several plans concerning supplies and similar matters have already been adopted. The impression gained in political circles is that the public is somewhat alarmed by the recent campaign in foreign newspapers against neutral countries, and by the fact that German aircraft have been repeatedly flying over Belgian airspace.

At this time, there were 15 people left on the "Sedov", under the command of the 28-year-old captain Badigin. After receiving coal and other supplies, the "Sedov" continued to drift. During the drift, the ship continued astronomical and nautical observations. Afterwards, the "Sedov" drifted westward. On December 15 (1939), the icebreaker "Stalin" was ordered to leave Murmansk to rescue the "Sedov", at that time under the command of Babinan.

<h3>Chinese Troops in Southern Guangxi Intensify Siege of Japanese Troops in Nanning, Japanese Wounded and Heavy Weapons Withdraw South to Liuzhou, Eight Japanese Aircraft Shot Down</h3>
<p>Guilin correspondence, the Japanese invasion of southern Guangxi is actually related to the invasions of northern Hunan and northern Guangdong. It is because the Japanese wanted to lure the Chinese army to aid Guangxi, and then carry out a large-scale plan in northern Guangdong and northern Hunan. This has been seen through by the Chinese army, which responded separately. The Japanese army in northern Hunan did not dare to come again, and the Japanese army in northern Guangdong also collapsed completely. The Chinese army in southern Guangxi intensified its counter-offensive against Nanning, determined to eliminate the main force of the Japanese army. Since the counter-offensive from various directions, the mechanical units and the new air force have contributed greatly, so the battle situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Siege of Nanning</p>
<p>Since the Chinese army recaptured the Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth Ponds, the Japanese army repeatedly launched counter-attacks on the Fifth and Sixth Ponds. After being met with a head-on attack by the Chinese army, the Japanese army was defeated and retreated south. The Chinese army followed and pursued, capturing more than 400 Japanese officers and soldiers, who have been sent to a certain unit in the rear. The Japanese army in Shanxu was fiercely besieged by the Chinese army. After a day and night of fierce fighting, more than half of them had been annihilated by the Chinese army. The remaining were defeated and fled in panic. On the evening of December 28, the Chinese army launched a fierce attack on the Luotang Fortress, and captured the Luotang Fortress that night. The Japanese army in Kunlun Pass lost their barrier, and the Chinese army continued to advance. Hundreds of Japanese cavalry to the west of Kunlun Pass once tried to break through desperately on the 27th, but were chased by the Chinese army and collapsed in panic, leaving more than 50 bodies behind. The Chinese army seized more than 30 military horses and many important documents. According to reports, there are only more than 4,000 Japanese troops in the area north of the Yong River, and about 1,000 in Gaofeng, who are constantly attacked by the Chinese army, so casualties are often more than 60%. For several days, the Japanese army in Nanning has been withdrawing heavy weapons, ammunition, and food to the south bank of the Yu River. On the 28th, they also withdrew 20 artillery pieces from Nanning across the river along the highway towards Xiaodong. At the same time, the Japanese army around Nanning has been repeatedly attacked by the Chinese army, suffering heavy casualties. According to inquiries, more than 3,000 Japanese wounded are being transported from Nanning to Xiaodong. Except for a small number of seriously injured, who use stretchers, the rest are walking with injuries, traversing the mountains in great pain. Many people died along the way.</p>
<p>Chinese Aircraft Assist in Battle</p>
<p>The Chinese army's counter-offensive against Nanning this time was greatly aided by the air force. The Chinese aircraft currently stationed in Guangxi are giving the Japanese army a major blow at any time. The Chinese aircraft have been sending teams to sweep the remaining Japanese troops in Kunlun Pass and Jiutang, providing great help to the Chinese army's ground attack units. The Chinese army has now completely eliminated the Japanese troops in western Kunlun and is flying to the front to assist the troops continuing to advance westward.</p>
<p>Japanese Army Flees Westward</p>
<p>The Chinese army's continuous and fierce counter-offensive is unstoppable. The Japanese army divided into two groups and fled westward from Sile, attempting to occupy Longzhou. The defending troops in that area gave them a head-on attack. At the same time, in order to annihilate the Japanese army in that area, the Chinese army dispatched another elite force to detour and pursue. After two days of fierce fighting, more than 1,000 Japanese troops in Sile were completely surrounded and annihilated, capturing more than 700 rifles, more than 40 light machine guns, several small steel cannons, and countless ammunition and horses, and capturing two colonels. Sile has now been completely recovered by the Chinese army. As for the vanguard of the Japanese army attempting to disturb Longzhou by fleeing westward, their rear was cut off, and they were met with a head-on attack by the Chinese army. They were panicked and fled back, attempting to break through Sile to avoid being annihilated.</p>
<p>Air Battle Over Liuzhou</p>
<p>At 1:30 PM on December 30, 18 Japanese Type 96 fighter planes attempted to invade Liuzhou. The Chinese air force heard the news and took off from various locations, surrounding them from all directions and launching a fierce attack. Although the Japanese planes charged left and right, they had no chance to escape. After about 15 minutes of fighting, the remaining Japanese planes could not hold on and fled in panic. As a result, the Chinese army shot down a total of eight Japanese planes. Two have been found, killing one Japanese aviator, Cheng Tianbo, who belonged to the Japanese Navy's 14th Air Corps. His clothing was made in Sasebo and the British naval port. In addition, many scattered personal belongings and amulets from Mount Kominato were obtained. The remains of the other Japanese planes are being searched by various local agencies. It has been found that one is in Dalongtan, five miles from Liuzhou, and the fuselage is completely destroyed. The other is in Labao, five miles from Liuzhou. The pilot parachuted to escape, but was shot dead by the Chinese army.</p>
<h3>Unstable Situation in Wuxi, Disturbance Continues After Assassination of Puppet Governor</h3>
<p>Wuxi correspondence, after the puppet governor Yang Shoutong was assassinated, the disturbance in the city has not ended. At the same time, Yang's guard, Zhang Wansheng, was also killed. Yang was 63 years old, lived at Zhenghe Bridge, South Gate, Wuxi, studied in Japan, graduated from Tokyo High School, and was the manager of Guangqin Yarn Factory before the war. He took office as a puppet official on August 13 last year. Recently, Qianqiao Xin Sheng Silk Factory bribed to release the detained fresh cocoons with 40,000 yuan, which was found out by the puppet provincial government and given a major demerit. Before a few days had passed, he was shot and killed. No one knows who will succeed him. Since the 11th, the puppet government has temporarily stopped issuing county resident certificates, moving certificates, and passes. The Japanese army has also banned traffic inside and outside the city, and on Wuqiao, Xinglong Bridge, Yinglong Bridge, Qingming Bridge, Tingzi Bridge, Shiren Bridge, and Tangnan Bridge from 6 PM to 8 AM the next day (Japanese time) without the permission of the Japanese army. The Japanese Gendarmerie has offered a reward of 1,000 yuan to investigate and arrest the attackers. Water and land transportation is also very strict. The city gate has been closed for three days and has not yet been opened.</p>
<h3>Dinghai Puppet Officials Revolt</h3>
<p>Dinghai correspondence, the Japanese army used the local gentry and scoundrels Ding Ziheng, Chen Jianan, He Chuicang, Qi Dejun, Wang Hongqing, Wang Kuichang, Xu Yangxi, Hong Qiliang, etc. to organize a puppet county government. However, there are quite a few upright gentry among them who were lured by the Japanese. County Chief Su sent spies to the city many times to persuade them to revolt or warn the criminals, hoping that they would repent. As a result, Shen Songnan, the puppet vice-chairman who was forced to be a traitor, Chen Songling, the chief of the finance section, and Hu Muxin, the chief of the transportation section, were all deeply moved, so they abandoned their official hats and fled to other places to hide. Yesterday, dozens of puppet soldiers revolted again and brought their guns and equipment to join the Chinese guerrillas. Therefore, the Japanese army has been extremely panicked recently.</p>
<p>Education News</p>
<h3>Fujian Province Promotes Wartime Higher Education, National Xiamen University Moves to Western Fujian, Three Private Schools Also Move to Northern Fujian, Fujian Provincial University Actively Prepares to Open in the Spring</h3>
<p>(Fuzhou correspondence) There are four universities in Fujian Province: National Xiamen University and three private colleges: Union College, Fujian College, and Hwa Nan Women's College. Xiamen University was located in Xiamen before the war and has now moved to the interior of western Fujian. Union College, Fujian College, and Hwa Nan Women's College were all located in Fuzhou before the war and have now moved to the interior of northern Fujian. Among them, Xiamen University has the most complete equipment, followed by Union College. According to a recent inspection report by the Ministry of Education, after Xiamen University moved to a certain place in western Fujian, the school buildings were rented from private houses and ancestral halls, most of which were too small and insufficient for use. There are now three colleges and nine departments: the College of Liberal Arts has three departments: Chinese Literature, History, and Education; the College of Science has four departments: Mathematics and Physics, Chemistry, Biology, and Civil Engineering; and the College of Business has two departments: Commerce and Economics. There are a total of 319 male and female students in the entire school, including 74 in the College of Liberal Arts, 113 in the College of Science, and 114 in the College of Business. There are a total of 87 faculty and staff members. A tutor system is implemented, dividing the students into 23 groups, each group with 9 to 13 people, and a tutor is responsible for guiding them. The tutor group meets once a month to discuss moral education and practical issues. Starting this year, it is planned to establish a class in the Department of Education, the nature of which is similar to the second part of the normal college and the in-service training class for secondary school teachers, to train excellent teachers for secondary schools to meet the current needs of the province. However, since the beginning of the War of Resistance, universities and colleges in major cities in the southeast have completely moved to the southwest and northwest provinces. The universities and colleges in this province are also limited by economics and student places, and cannot accommodate high school graduates in this province as much as possible. At the same time, in order to actively carry out public health and various economic construction projects in the province, and train local administrative cadres, a large number of agricultural, medical, and law specialists are needed. Therefore, a medical college was established in the 26th year of the Republic and renamed the Provincial Medical College in July of this year. Now the provincial government has decided to run a large-scale Provincial Fujian University next year, with three colleges: Agriculture, Law, and Medicine, and an attached normal training course, specializing in training teachers for secondary schools in this province. At present, two groups of science and music are set up first, and then groups such as Chinese language, history, and geography will be added. The start-up fee is set at 400,000 yuan, and the regular annual fee is 360,000 yuan, which has been passed by the provincial government meeting and included in the next year's budget. Regarding all preparatory matters, the provincial government has appointed 12 preparatory committee members to prepare in groups. The drafting of university regulations, the compilation of college courses, the purchase of books and instruments, and the construction of school buildings have all begun and are expected to open in February next year. In addition, the Department of Education has ordered the organization of a graduate continuing research committee in various private colleges. It has been found that graduates of various private colleges in Fujian Province rarely have the opportunity to continue academic research after leaving school. Even if a few young people can work hard to study on their own, they also feel the pain of no guidance and lack of tools. In order to make up for the above shortcomings and promote the atmosphere of academic research, the Department of Education has specially formulated the guidelines for the organization of the graduate continuing research committee in various private colleges, and has detailed regulations on the methods of guiding graduates to continue research. The provincial government has ordered all colleges to comply with it. (November 20)</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Investigates Educational Organizations in Shanghai</h3>

<h3>First Cycle Creates a Winning Streak: Lido Defeats St. Francis Xavier 4-2, With Lido Leading 3-1 in the First Half: Lido's Offense and Defense Were Excellent Yesterday</h3>
<p>Lido has created a clean sweep of all victories in the first cycle of the Western Union Football First Division League. Yesterday, at the Yiyuan Stadium, they overcame the so-called dark horse, St. Francis Xavier, 4-2, with Lido leading 3-1 in the first half. With this, the entire first cycle is complete. St. Francis Xavier is made up of young and strong players. In the first ten minutes of the game, they played with vigor and momentum. Lido was almost in danger due to the intensity of their offensive. Fortunately, Lido's defense was strong, with Li Yichen guarding the three goals like an impregnable wall. St. Francis Xavier failed to break through, and their morale was weakened. Lido switched to offense, using the left wing, where Qiu Ting was very active, repeatedly penetrating. The St. Francis Xavier team's defense was weak and fell into chaos, losing three goals in a row. The outcome was thus determined. The rest of the game was just formality. The lineups of the two sides were as follows: Lido: Lu Zhongen, Li Yichen, Zhang Linggen, Yan Shixin, Meng Yiliang, Jiang Zhaoxiang, Cao Qiuheng, Sun Jinshun, Huang Kehou, Xu Wenkui, Wu Qixiang. St. Francis Xavier: Kai Botuo, Qie Hu Te, S. Xu Erz, Eduard, Greenbo, K. Kui Shitie, Kai Luolie, Qu Pantuosun, Xu Erz, Toutuo Meng, Fu En.</p>
<p>St. Francis Xavier Runs Rampant</p>
<p>St. Francis Xavier kicked off and attacked first. Huang Kehou intercepted and passed the ball, and Wu Qixiang rushed into the enemy's camp and shot, but it went wide. St. Francis Xavier came with all its strength, like a storm, unstoppable. This was St. Francis Xavier's initial momentum. It was a pity that it was only a flash in the pan, and the sharp edge gradually faded. Lido's army retreated, defending tightly. A Kui knocked down an enemy general and was penalized with a free kick. Greenbo aimed and shot fiercely, with great momentum. Chang Lu received and fumbled, but luckily kicked it out, averting danger. Unexpectedly, in a moment, Fu En, who had been trapped by Li Yichen for a long time, broke free from Li's shackles and drove straight in. Fortunately, Zhang Linggen saved it, which was a great contribution. Fu En came again, shooting from afar. Toutuo Meng gritted his teeth and shot dangerously. Both shots were saved by Li Yichen's divine block. Fu En caught the ball and lobbed it from afar, but there was no response, and Chang Lu finally caught it safely.</p>
<p>Three Goals in a Row</p>
<p>Within ten minutes, St. Francis Xavier was so fierce and invincible. Lido fought hard, and the situation was dull and undeveloped. But finally, the tide turned. Qiu Ting cut in and fell into the enemy's arms. A Kui crossed three levels and passed it to the center. Unexpectedly, Kehou headed it, missing by an inch. Qiu Ting cut across the center, dribbling and shooting. Sun Jinshun arrived in time, but just as he was about to shoot, Greenbo cleared it from the danger zone. Qiu Ting Kehou then made two consecutive fierce shots, but still failed to score. In a blink of an eye, more than half an hour had passed. Two minutes later, A Kui made a long pass from the center, and Qixiang intercepted and rushed forward, lobbing it to the center. Jinshun Kehou rushed together, and Kai Botuo was knocked to the ground, unable to get up quickly. Sun Jinshun headed the ball outside the goal line, then pushed it into the net, scoring the first goal. The audience cheered. Four minutes later, Lido's golden gun was fired, and the momentum was like a broken bamboo. A Sun and Qiu Ting passed the ball to each other. A Sun seized the opportunity and passed it. Qiu Ting shot, and the St. Francis Xavier goal was broken again. Five minutes later, Qiu Ting cleverly tricked Da Xu Erz, passing it to A Kui from afar. A Kui headed it backward, and the iron leg volleyed, kicking it into the lower right corner from afar. Lido scored three goals in seven minutes, and the audience cheered. Fusi was entangled by Yichen, and urgently switched positions with Toutuo Meng, but still could not escape A Li's control. So he changed to center forward, which was indeed effective. In the forty-second minute, Fusi passed from the center, and Eduard took advantage of the momentum to lob it. Zhang Linggen missed it, and Kai Luolie strode in and shot from five yards away. Chang Lu had no choice but to let the ball in. St. Francis Xavier broke the duck egg, and the first half ended 3-1.</p>
<p>One Gain and One Loss</p>
<p>After the two teams regrouped, Fu En still played center forward, but was strictly guarded by Meng Yiliang and still did nothing. Both sides built high walls, and the situation became dull again. At the fourteenth minute, A Li made a long pass outside the field, and Xiao Xu penetrated to twelve yards, and it seemed certain that it would hit, but unexpectedly it was blocked by Da Xu Erz and went out. In a blink of an eye, Xiao Xu shot from thirty yards away, and Chang Lu blocked it with his arm and kicked it out of the danger zone. In the sixteenth minute, A Kui and Qie Hu Te competed for the ball. The ball touched Qie Hu Te's hand, and A Kui took the penalty kick at twelve yards, hitting the lower left corner with his right foot, making it 4-1. The victory was thus established. After that, Lido's offensive was repeated, but none of them were successful. A Kui's shot flew high into the sky, and Lao Sun's close header went wide. Qixiang again hit the goalkeeper's arms. After that, the situation calmed down, and Lido did not do too much, relaxing the offensive, thinking of celebrating the victory, but unexpectedly in the last two minutes, Pantuo Tianbian shot from twenty yards away, and flew straight into the upper right corner of the net. Soon after, the whistle blew, and Lido won 4-2.</p>
<h3>Reserve Cup Replay: Lido Eliminated, Lax Gets Finals Ticket in 1-3 Overtime Victory</h3>
<p>The reserve cup replay between Lido and Lax took place yesterday at Jiaozhou Park. It attracted a large audience. Unexpectedly, Lido suffered a heavy loss due to the fierce battle with Fangji in the morning, Li Yichen bore the brunt of the damage, Sun Jinshun's fat body could no longer climb, and Meng Wu also struggled to support. With the main players discouraged, Lax was waiting leisurely, and was thus able to succeed. In the first half, Lido was in a favorable position, but failed to complete the task. Repeated good opportunities were lost due to A Li's inability to move. In the replay, Meng Yiliang accidentally fouled after only five minutes, and was penalized with a free kick. Peige scored from twenty yards away, which was unexpected. Lido launched a desperate counterattack, and finally Wu Qixiang scored one goal each in the last three minutes. In the extended replay, Yinggelun scored another goal in the first half, making it 2-1. In the second half, Wu Ermu also scored in the crowd, and Lido suffered an unprecedented defeat of 1-3, and unexpectedly lost the Reserve Cup, which was deeply regrettable. After Lax won the finals ticket, they will compete with Xifusi for the championship. In yesterday's game, Lido's Zheng Tongyu and Jiang Chao were very hard-working. Meng Yiliang still had stamina, but Wu lost more than just that. The front line was full of injured players, and only Xiao Wu was able to score a goal. The lineup is as follows: Lido Club: Zheng Tongyu, Jiang Chao, Meng Yiliang, Yun Feng, Zhang Xianlun, Wu Qixiang, Le Xiuhua, Zeng Rongzhong, Li Yichen, Shen Zuliang, Zhang Mingsheng. Lax: Greenbo, Musaidike, Kofu Lie, Kofu Siji, Aqigu Fu, Xu Lun Siji, Ke Xunaite, Ke Tiebo Tuo, Bo Blot, Yinggelun Pei Ge Wu Ermu.</p>

<h3>The Dynamics of Shanghai Finance in the 28th Year</h3>
<p>— Zhu Boquan</p>
<p>I. Introduction</p>
<p>Since the war spread in the winter of the 26th year, the ports along the Yangtze River and the coast have fallen one after another, and Shanghai has a sense of being an isolated island. This is true in terms of the political environment and transportation, and it is also true in terms of the economic situation.</p>
<p>Shanghai has always been the trade center of the Southeast. Now, the agricultural and native products of various places, such as cotton, rice, silk cocoons, jute, and livestock, are either prohibited by the government or obstructed by transportation in the inland areas, and most of them cannot be transported to Shanghai. In the occupied areas, most of them are controlled or bought out. There are very few who can freely transport to Shanghai for marketing or distribution, and regardless of whether the industry and other industries in the occupied areas still exist or not, there is no way to intervene. Therefore, the original normal economic relationship between Shanghai and various places is like a broken lotus root with lingering threads, which is very different from the past. Even though there has been a good harvest in various places this year, the benefits of trade migration are mostly not owned by the Chinese people.</p>
<p>Before describing the main text, we must first examine the general economic situation within the isolated island, and then we can have a more intimate understanding of the financial market in the past year.</p>
<p>The economy within the isolated island has many morbidities after the war, which has been very obvious in the past year. The main points are divided and described as follows:</p>
<p>Because (1) the order and safety of the Shanghai Concession has been maintained to a considerable extent, the people who fled from various places during the war all regarded Shanghai as a paradise, and they have gathered more and more in the past two years. Where people gather, funds follow. In addition, (2) the economic facilities in the North have been renovated this year, and (3) the war has broken out in Europe, and the British Eastern territories have implemented financial controls. For these two reasons, the funds that have been fleeing have also regarded Shanghai as a den. Therefore, the funds accumulated in Shanghai in the 26th year have become more and more rampant in recent years. Although the discussion about the transfer of funds to the Southwest has been very popular in recent years, the large-scale transfer may not be achieved overnight. How to coordinate and consider both aspects and disperse the funds in Shanghai so that they can be used in the right way still needs further efforts. This influx of hot money is one of the morbidities.</p>
<p>The influx of hot money is so great, and the normal investment channels are even more lacking due to the aforementioned interruption of trade relations with various places. Therefore, the buying and selling of foreign exchange, foreign currencies, gold, and various goods has reached its peak this year. Speculators regard it as a shortcut to get rich quickly, and those who are worried regard it as a guarantee of private property. If they don't go this way, they will go that way. This prosperity of speculation is the second morbidity.</p>
<p>Prices have soared this year. According to the figures released by the China Statistical Society, taking the 25th year as the benchmark, the 26th year was 118 strong, the 27th year was 153 weak, June of this year was 164, and it rose step by step to 283 strong in September. The reasons are (A) the crazy shrinkage of the foreign exchange black market, (B) the continuation of the European war, plus (C) all kinds of commodity speculation within the concession, and (D) all kinds of controls outside the concession. The prices within the isolated island are no longer limited to economic factors. Therefore, the rice is as precious as pearls and the firewood is as expensive as cassia, which is not only a description in words. The public within the isolated island has actually shouldered the same burden as the people in the war zone. This is a very serious problem that cannot be ignored. This is the third morbidity.</p>
<p>Due to the large local consumption, the sharp increase in prices, the stimulation of the European war, the small industries, importers, and retailers within the concession have all achieved a well-off life in recent years. The real estate and construction industries have also become more active than the previous year due to the continued increase in population. This prosperous image of industry and commerce within the concession is a morbidity that cannot be denied. This is the fourth morbidity.</p>
<p>The financial market situation in the past year is divided into sections and described below.</p>
<p>II. Issuance of Legal Tender</p>
<p>The total amount of legal tender issued at the end of June in the 26th year before the war was 140,000 yuan (approximately, the same below). At the end of the same year after the war, it was 160,000 yuan. At the end of June of the 27th year, it was 170,000 yuan. In July of this year, the government announced that the total amount of legal tender issued at the end of June of the 28th year was 260,000 yuan. The ratio of cash reserves to guarantee reserves, which was originally 60 to 40, is now 44 to 56. Comparing the above figures, the increase in issuance in the first year after the war was only 30,000 yuan, the increase in the second year was 90,000 yuan, and the amount issued at the end of June of this year increased by one time compared to before the war.</p>
<p>Regarding the increase of about one time in the issuance of legal tender after the war, there were quite a few malicious comments at the time. But: (1) Since the currency system reform in the 24th year of our country, the amount issued increased by about 60,000 yuan in the 25th year. After the war broke out, the increase in the first year of the war was reduced. In fact, at this time, the issuance of legal tender continued in the process of development, and the reason why the increase was reduced was mostly due to the government's consistent adoption of a sound and conservative policy on the issuance of legal tender. In the early stage of the war, there was even a trend of contraction. (2) Although legal tender in the war zone has been destroyed and used in many ways, the need for it in the southwestern provinces is still great. It cannot be compared with the use of banknotes in other countries, which has already reached a considerable level, or even an extreme level. In the past year, the government has repeatedly stated that the policy of maintaining legal tender has not changed. It has tried its best to tighten legal tender in the war zone, and it has also been extremely cautious about the supply of legal tender in Shanghai. All of these are facts that are better than eloquence. It can be said that there is no sign of malignant inflation so far. As for the reduction of cash reserves, it is true that the government said that it is still higher than most countries.</p>
<p>Since the foreign exchange black market has been shrinking frequently, and in August there were rumors that the government had ordered a large amount of legal tender abroad, in the isolated island where rumors are as many as waves, "Will legal tender become the mark?" We often hear this question. Those who are slightly knowledgeable, have common sense, know the history of the mark, and know the status of the issuance of legal tender can immediately deny it. However, the fanaticism of the foreign exchange market has suddenly increased. We have no way to estimate how much legal tender is circulating in Shanghai, but because the status of legal tender is of great concern to the general public, we will briefly describe one or two in this section.</p>
<p>The soaring prices this year have greatly reduced the purchasing power of legal tender in Shanghai. However, the purchasing power of the same legal tender is very different in Shanghai and other places, and there are also differences in other places. Taking rice as an example, the market price in eastern Zhejiang is only half of that in Shanghai. The high price of goods in Shanghai is no longer dominated by various economic factors. As mentioned earlier, the low exchange rate of the legal tender black market is one of the above-mentioned economic factors, but the increase in the amount of legal tender issued is not enough to constitute a factor. As for the prices in the inland areas, although they are all higher than before the war, each has its own reasons in terms of production and transportation.</p>
<p>As countries intensify their military buildup, the prices of metals have soared. Between summer and autumn, the copper coins, copper subsidiary coins, and copper-nickel subsidiary coins circulating in the market were all bought up, melted down, and smuggled. In addition to the angular subsidiary coin tickets, subsidiary coins are almost extinct in the market. Therefore, stamps were used as substitutes, and then train tickets, bus tickets, stamps, etc. all became temporary subsidiary coins. General stores printed value vouchers for change. The variety was dazzling, which was extremely inconvenient for the public. The price increase was probably also assisted by this invisibly. After September, the Central Bank issued five-cent and one-cent subsidiary coin tickets, and increased the issuance of angular subsidiary coin tickets to meet the needs. The number seems to be still insufficient.</p>
<p>III. Foreign Exchange Black Market</p>
<p>The most changeable and influential aspect of finance this year is the foreign exchange black market. Since the government implemented foreign exchange control last year, the Central Bank has supplied foreign exchange at the statutory price. Because its supply is extremely strict, the general demand for foreign exchange is still obtained from the black market. The transaction is quite prosperous, and the market price is also quite stable due to the government's regulation. The situation this year can be divided into three periods:</p>
<p>The first period is from January to May. At the beginning of the year, the foreign exchange black market still hovered around 8 pence to 8 and a half pence. In March, the Exchange Equalization Fund was established with a fund of 10 million pounds, and the British borrowed half of the fund. Therefore, the rise and fall of the foreign exchange black market was less significant. However, the demand for foreign exchange was still huge. Generally speaking, there were four reasons:</p>
<p>(1) The huge amount of imports exceeding exports. Although Shanghai has always been an import-export port, the amount of imports exceeding exports has never been greater than at this time. According to Finance &amp; Commerce statistics, from January to June of this year, Shanghai's foreign trade converted imports at the statutory price first, and then converted to national currency at the black market price. The total imports were 600 million yuan, and the exports were 170 million yuan. The imports exceeding exports in half a year reached 430 million yuan, which is about 13 times the imports exceeding exports in the same period of the 27th year. (2) The escape of funds from the north. In North China, the so-called joint bank notes were forcibly used this spring, and the price of legal tender was reduced in stages. Even the circulation and use of legal tender in the Tianjin Concession was threatened in many ways. Therefore, the funds from the Northeast came to Shanghai in a steady stream, and one part of them was used for foreign exchange. (3) The Japanese used various tricks to arbitrage the legal tender that was looted in the north and other war zones. After this legal tender came to Shanghai, it was exchanged for foreign exchange at any time. (4) Although the general public in Shanghai has a long-standing belief in legal tender, the psychology of the masses during wartime is very different from peacetime. They follow the crowd and are unavoidable. Most of them are overly worried, but the trend of hoarding legal tender, when applied to foreign exchange, adds another burden to the foreign exchange market. At the same time, the export bills on the market are as rare as phoenix feathers. Under this state of oversupply, the continued stability of the black market exchange rate for more than five months is almost entirely due to the support of the government and the Equalization Fund.</p>
<p>The second period is from June to August. On June 7th, the Exchange Equalization Fund temporarily stopped maintaining the black market exchange rate. The announcement was like a bolt from the blue, and the city was shocked. Rumors spread, and speculative and blind buying came one after another. HSBC Bank changed its listing three times in one day. The 8 pence black market exchange rate, which had been stable for 18 months, fell to about 6 and a half pence.</p>
<p>There were many different speculations about the Equalization Fund's cessation of foreign exchange supply to the black market at that time, except for meaningless and malicious rumors. The most common one was that the fund had been used up in the past three months and could no longer be maintained. In fact, as mentioned above, the purchase of foreign exchange in the first half of the year was as described above. In the continuation of this situation, whether it is a wise move to continue to maintain the 8 pence exchange rate is self-evident. The abundance of the fund balance is a secondary issue. Therefore, the financial authorities issued a statement on July 10th, saying that the matter was approved by the government, and its purpose was to make the black market exchange rate "suitable for the standards that are beneficial to China's economy." The market's hearing was corrected. At the same time, at the new level of about 6 and a half pence, there was a considerable supply in the market, and the respite was slightly relieved. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Japan's Economy is Collapsing</h3>
<p>— Zhao Jianzi</p>
<p>Blatant Signs of Collapse</p>
<p>There are many reasons why Japanese Prime Minister Abe's position is unstable; however, the lower house members only single out the economy, which is beyond remedy, as a target of attack. The military also uses the "insufficient resolution of the China Incident as a pretext for clinging to power" to pressure Abe to step down. Revealing the hardships of the people, whether as a facade or not, is always the most powerful means in political struggle. From this, one can imagine the anxiety in the lives of his people! (Editor: The Abe cabinet has already fallen.)</p>
<p>This is the fourth reorganization of Japan's wartime cabinet, and it is the first time that economic problems have been used as a reason for the cabinet's downfall. The Japanese economy has always suffered from congenital deficiencies, and the war has exacerbated this condition. In the past, the hardships of the Japanese people had long been unbearable, but their ruling class still avoided mentioning them, maintaining a calm demeanor. Now, they have suddenly become flustered and, with the joint signature of more than half of the members of the Diet, are publicly declaring the reasons for the cabinet's downfall, shouting loudly. Of course, it is already in imminent danger; I am sure they will still avoid seeking medical attention for their condition!</p>
<p>The Disintegration of the Ruling Class</p>
<p>Japan's ruling class is a combination of warlords, bureaucrats, and financial cliques. The first threat to them when the national economy collapses is "financial helplessness."</p>
<p>"Financial helplessness": The warlords will have no power to wield because their power relies solely on modern weapons, which can only be obtained by extracting the fat from the people. The ability and purpose of bureaucrats to be active is nothing more than money. Without money, they are also at a loss. The financial cliques are uniquely afraid of the financial burden being too great, unable to be passed on to the people; profits will be drastically reduced, and there is even the danger of having to empty their own pockets. Therefore, whenever the issue of finance is raised, Japan's ruling class will start to clash with each other. Although the targets of attack by the lower house members are food and prices, seemingly speaking for the people; in essence, they are planning for themselves. However, this calculation must be based on stabilizing the livelihoods of the people. Thus, they have chosen the two points of food and prices, which are of serious concern to the people's livelihood.</p>
<p>Financial Helplessness</p>
<p>In the past two and a half years: total expenditures have exceeded 21 billion; of which 12.7 billion have been thrown into the Chinese battlefield and have vanished into thin air. In order to raise this uncompensated expenditure, 10.7 billion in public bonds and more than 1.1 billion in banknotes (excluding those issued in Korea and Taiwan, and military currency in China) have been issued; and general taxes have been increased by 50% to 3-4 times. For example, ordinary income tax, which used to be 50 yuan, now requires 211 yuan; like the temporary profits tax, which used to be 30 yuan, now one must pay 140 yuan or face imprisonment. Moreover, in addition to this desperate expenditure, there is also the loss of millions of lives and countless indirect losses of various material and spiritual kinds!</p>
<p>The total amount of expenditures for the next fiscal year has increased by more than 1 billion yuan compared to the current year, reaching 10.4 billion yuan. Although temporary military expenses are listed as 4.5 billion, general accounting has increased by nearly 700 million, reaching 4.95 billion yuan. Among them, the combined increase for the army and navy is nearly 500 million, accounting for more than 2.3 billion; debt servicing has increased by 200 million, reaching 1.4 billion. In order to supply such huge funds, taxes are ruthlessly increased again, but the estimated increase is less than 1 billion; therefore, they have no choice but to plan to issue another 5.5 billion yuan in new public bonds.</p>
<p>Of the 10.7 billion new public bonds issued in the past two and a half years, 2.1 billion were handed over to the deposit department, and 7.6 billion were handed over to the Bank of Japan. This is what they call "digestion of public bonds." At the end of Showa 11 (i.e., the end of 1936 before the war), the current amount of Japan's national debt was 10.4 billion; the following year (i.e., the end of the first half-year of the war) it increased to 11.9 billion; at the end of the 13th year, it increased to 16.2 billion; at the end of November last year, it had already increased to nearly 20.9 billion, and by the end of the next fiscal year, it is feared that it will break through the 30 billion mark.</p>
<p>Leaving aside how long this can last? Looking at the present, both the Japanese government and the people have reached the end of their rope.</p>
<p>The Disintegration of the National Economy</p>
<p>Looking at the two points of commodity prices and food that the lower house members are attacking, they include all the symptoms of the disintegration of Japan's wartime economic system. The material needs of the war have exhausted foreign exchange resources and the people's living resources; therefore, commodity prices have soared, and there is no way to remedy it. In November last year, the wholesale price index increased to 242%, the retail price index increased to 235.7%, and the cost of living index increased to 226%. No matter how high-pressure the government implements control, the upward trend is still increasing day by day.</p>
<p>The manpower needs of the war have emptied the labor force in rural and urban areas. According to the Diamond Company's survey, the proportion of female and child labor in the total number of factory workers has increased by an average of more than double compared to before the war, reaching 48.1%; the situation in rural areas is even worse. Therefore, agricultural production has sharply decreased, and famine is becoming more serious. The lack of manpower makes it impossible to replenish the army and increase production is in a desperate situation; foreign trade is becoming increasingly worse. In the past two years and eleven months, exports to third countries were only 5.87 billion yuan, while imports reached 7.62 billion, with a trade deficit of 1.8 billion yuan. Considering the situation of trade and other receipts in his pre-war international balance of payments, most of them were overpayments exceeding income: like Showa 10, the overpayment was 194 million yuan, and in Showa 11, the overpayment was 36 million yuan. Under these circumstances, who can believe the reports he published on gold reserve preparations?</p>
<p>According to his own account, Japan's domestic gold production is only a little over 100 million yuan per year, and it can never offset the reverse surplus in the international balance of payments. Therefore, the only way to procure overseas materials, apart from seizing the foreign exchange resources in the occupied areas of China, is to seize the living needs of the people of other countries to supplement them. Seizing people's needs to meet military needs is already a last resort; moreover, the other side of suppressing people's needs is the complete exhaustion of financial tax sources. Therefore, financially, they have no choice but to rely on borrowing and issuing more banknotes. The more the banknotes inflate, the more commodity prices rise, the more purchasing power decreases, the more the volume of commodity transactions among the people declines, and the contraction rate of banknote issuance is equal to zero. For example, the contraction rate of banknote issuance in January of this year was only 26.4%, which had decreased to 10.4% by November; in October, it even shrunk to 6.9%. Pure inflation is the main phenomenon in malignant inflation. Japan's wartime economy is moving towards this malignant end of pure inflation. No matter what, they do not hesitate to prohibit banknotes flowing out of the country from returning to the country. This last resort of "foreign goods when leaving home" not only completely loses the credit of the Japanese yen but also cuts off the foreign exchange resources of overseas remittances from overseas Chinese, which is the main item in its trade and other income. Therefore, the result is that the difficulty in procuring materials is increasingly increased; thus, the vicious cycle of borrowing, increasing taxes, issuing more banknotes, seizing people's needs, promoting high commodity prices, sharply reducing purchasing power, declining people's transactions, and exhausting tax sources, finally stepping into today's desperate situation.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Japan's ruling class has seen that as the war drags on, China's economic foundation for resistance and reconstruction becomes stronger day by day, while its own war economic foundation is closer to complete bankruptcy. Therefore, they are eager to make peace. But unconditional peace would mean that the Japanese warlords would not be able to account for their actions back home; conditional peace is definitely not what China wants to hear. Because of this stalemate, in China, it is precisely where the long-term war of resistance has a chance of winning; in Japan, however, it is difficult to escape the dangerous fate of a complete collapse; and this dangerous fate is now rapidly sweeping in. Therefore, when looking forward to the future of the Sino-Japanese War, apart from the Japanese, there is absolutely no need to consider the issue of war and peace; there are only the goals of victory and defeat; and victory will definitely belong to China, and defeat will definitely belong to Japan. The Japanese members of the Diet unprecedentedly used economic problems as the reason for the cabinet's downfall, which reflects the micro-signs that the Japanese economy has begun to collapse rapidly; it also sets forth that China's war of resistance has grasped the assurance of final victory. In order to welcome the speed of the final victory, in addition to military efforts, economic resistance should be strengthened. The people in the occupied areas should especially resolutely oppose the economic blockade in terms of materials, so as to shatter his dream of borrowing the body to revive the soul! They should not use the excuse of a special environment, sticking their necks out and letting him carry out blood-letting work!</p>

<h3>Grain: Japonica Rice Stabilizes, Inland Merchants Actively Purchase Imported Rice, Which Initially Soars but Then Recedes</h3>
<p>Because bank warehouses are all closed on Sundays, goods in each warehouse are not available for inspection; only goods in our own warehouse are traded among themselves in the market; therefore, retail and wholesale transactions are scarce. Only local stores purchase small amounts of early japonica and early and late glutinous rice, so from morning to noon, there is little change in the prices of various goods. Although rice stores have slow sales, merchants from the interior suddenly actively purchase, all in wholesale transactions. The opening market is tight, and merchants shout out high prices. No. 1 Saigon rises from 37.3 yuan to 38 yuan, No. 2 Saigon also rises from 36.3 yuan to 37 yuan, rising all the way, seemingly about to soar into the clouds. However, general sellers also change their initial intentions and instead sell, making the market even tighter. Suddenly, some sell at high prices, and the market supply increases, so merchants from the interior are discouraged and unwilling to buy more. The market is then seen to hesitate and gradually soften. At the closing market, the price is only slightly higher than the opening market by two or three jiao. No. 1 Saigon peaked at 37.5 yuan, No. 2 Saigon was 36.6 yuan, Tokyo brand rice was 34.2 yuan, and broken rice was 33 yuan.</p>

<p>Knowledge of Sexuality</p>
<h3>Discussion on External Stimuli of Sexuality</h3>
<p>— Dr. Yang Daonan, Graduate of the Medical Department of the Russian Labor University</p>
<p>…Internal stimuli are caused by the vigor of hormones in the puberty glands…External stimuli are caused by the temptation of pornographic books and beauty</p>
<p>Although sexual desire is an instinct of human life, known without learning and capable without telling, there must be a reason for it to cause sexual arousal. What is the reason? That is, the relationship between internal and external stimuli. The so-called internal stimuli are when sexual desire naturally springs up and impulses without external temptation, and there are two reasons for this! One is the vigor of the puberty glands, and the other is the vigor of endocrine stimuli such as the thyroid gland and pituitary gland. This kind of puberty gland or thyroid gland endocrine has a certain amount, but if it is vigorous, this kind of secretion is enough to stimulate the sexual nerves and make them start. If there is too much secretion, the more the sexual nerves are stimulated, the more intense their start. Therefore, even without external temptation, sexual desire can also naturally impulse.</p>
<p>As for external stimuli, there are many kinds, some belonging to the mental and some belonging to the physiological. The former is caused by mental function, such as reading pornographic books, pornographic plays, pornographic paintings, and having beauty in front of you, all belonging to this. No matter how honest and reliable one is, when encountering external temptation, the nerves will inevitably be stimulated. Once stimulated, the sexual nerves will be affected, and sexual desire will inevitably impulse. Therefore, researchers of sexuality must not be ignorant of the two major causes of internal and external stimuli.</p>
<p>If the puberty glands of internal stimuli lose their prosperity, their sexual desire will show a morbid state. Even if there is external temptation, even if beauty is in front of you, it will be of no avail. Therefore, those who are good at hygiene must not allow the hormones of the puberty glands that dominate sexual desire to be wounded by荒淫, because apart from the decline of age, it is caused by excessive masturbation or纵慾荒淫. After the puberty glands are weak, nocturnal emission, spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, impotence, incomplete development, and neurasthenia cannot be avoided. How can one get pleasure during intercourse? This is not only a sign of one's own physical weakness, but also affects the love between husband and wife.</p>
<p>Now that it is clear that sexual desire stimulation lies in the prosperity of the puberty glands, therefore impotence, premature ejaculation, and other symptoms are also caused by the loss of health of the puberty glands. Therefore, the only way to treat the symptoms is to actively take the male "Butikon" containing hormones of male壮动物 puberty glands, which is most suitable for the symptoms, because "Butikon" contains pure testicular essence, all collected from orangutans and monkeys, because the nature of orangutans and monkeys is most suitable for the human body, and it contains brain-nourishing phosphorus, blood-nourishing iron, and bone-nourishing calcium. It produces sperm and nourishes the kidneys within 24 hours after taking it. The female "Butikon" can regulate menstruation and seeds, and has long been praised by doctors.</p>
<p>Spring and Autumn of Gonorrhea</p>
<h3>Groundbreaking Anti-Gonorrhea Drug</h3>
<p>— American Medical Doctor Huang Zhongchang</p>
<p>In recent years, my treatment of gonorrhea has become smoother than before; because my pathological anatomy of gonorrhea has been identified by science and experience, and in terms of medication, there is also a special drug available. Giving us a strong help.</p>
<p>Speaking of the invention of the special drug for gonorrhea, it was not accidental. Originally, the contagiousness of gonorrhea was extremely strong, and once infected, before "Kerinon" was invented, it simply made it impossible for doctors and patients to get rid of it. Therefore, every time gonorrhea is infected, it inevitably changes from acute to chronic, and from chronic to malignant. Once gonorrhea becomes malignant, the patient not only has the danger of making the disease infertile, but also has his life sacrificed by it, which is very regrettable. Therefore, all countries are actively working to prevent gonorrhea, and are rewarding scientists with honor and money. Of course, there must be brave men under heavy rewards, and Dr. Peter, a German gonorrhea master, took the lead in inventing the special drug for gonorrhea "Kerinon," which achieved unprecedented amazing results, and is worthy of being a groundbreaking achievement in gonorrhea treatment. Therefore, the world's most honorable and bonus was obtained by Dr. Peter and recognized as a special drug for gonorrhea. I have a good and pleasant impression of this drug.</p>
<p>Whether it is just beginning or has become chronic leukorrhea, taking "Kerinon" can produce anti-gonorrhea phagocytic effect in the shortest time. This effect occurs in every cell in the body, so its bactericidal power is abundant throughout the body, reaching everywhere and every detail; therefore, both acute and chronic gonorrhea can be taken. As for external medicine, men can use "Anti-Gonorrhea Water" externally according to the diagram and instructions to wash the urethra. Women with gonorrhea leucorrhea, in addition to taking "Kerinon" internally, can also use "Car Er Xue Di Vaginal Tablets" externally as a suppository, which will be effective. Strong physician</p>
<h3>Coughing and Hemoptysis</h3>
<p>— Sheng Zaiqiang Physician</p>
<p>Everyone knows. All people with pulmonary tuberculosis constitution. Their lungs are abnormally fragile. It really cannot withstand any vibration. And in this vibration. Lung capillaries are broken and bleed. This kind of thing that vibrates the lungs is no more than coughing. Therefore, coughing and hemoptysis. There is a close relationship. This is very obvious. To prevent hemoptysis. We must first calm the cough. And can make the cough calm down within three hours. Only "Bu Fei Naer II medicine. Enough to take it. Therefore, taking this medicine when coughing. Can prevent pulmonary hemorrhage. This is the correct result I have obtained from twenty years of experience.</p>
<h3>Cured Example of Cold Limbs</h3>
<p>— German Medical Doctor Zheng Ting</p>
<p>Patient Yu Chengda, 37 years old, Ningbo, Zhejiang, lives at No. 2, Xin Qiao Yong An Lane, Sampan Factory, Mupu, (self-report) - I was born with congenital insufficiency, and also had nocturnal emission before marriage. After marriage, I felt kidney deficiency. After I was 30 years old, I became more and more depressed. I felt back pain when I sat down a little. When I was 35 years old, I trembled all over and my limbs were icy cold every solar term. , I could not get out of bed, and the image of aging was chilling. I beg to be treated, etc. (Symptoms during diagnosis) - Weight 95 pounds ★ Pale complexion, has suffered from insomnia, although the sex life is not excessive, but premature ejaculation is very severe, because his blood and kidneys are both deficient, and he is prematurely aging. (Cured process) - Instructed him to engage in sports, do not smoke or drink alcohol, and take three tablets of testicular essence preparation for men "Butikon" three times a day. After taking it, I felt a great boost in spirit, and symptoms such as back pain and cold limbs were cured, because "a Butikon" can promote metabolism, eliminate neurasthenia, nourish the brain, nourish the kidneys, nourish the blood, and promote the development of reproductive organs. Therefore, it is quite symptomatic. Mr. Yu took it continuously for two months, and all the above symptoms were completely cured. His weight has increased by seven pounds, and when examining his sexual function, his erectile power is also stronger than before. Mr. Yu saw that the efficacy of the agent was miraculous, so he continued to purchase it. He stopped taking it at the end of last month, and his weight reached 110 pounds, his complexion was ruddy, and his appetite increased. In the past, Mr. Yu had cold limbs every time he turned to autumn and winter, but now even in the severe winter, he never feels cold or shivering.</p>
<p>Gonorrhea Lecture</p>
<h3>Gonorrhea Damages Marital Happiness</h3>
<p>— Yao Juyan Physician Consultation time: 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM</p>
<p>"No disease is a god, having a wife is enough for everything", the first sentence is an idiom, and the second sentence is derived from "having a son is enough for everything". In fact, based on my experience of more than 20 years, the love between couples in the world was originally very strong, but there are many who destroy their love due to venereal diseases, so those who suffer from venereal diseases often cause nameless resentment in their wives due to the transmission of the virus. In this way, how much fun is there in life? Therefore, once there is a venereal disease, especially gonorrhea, it should be treated immediately. Having gonorrhea is equivalent to the wife asking for a divorce. Even if there is a wise wife who reluctantly stays and leads a miserable life together, it is definitely not the happiness of a couple. Due to the above reasons, those who are infected with gonorrhea should be treated as soon as possible before entering the chronic gonorrhea period. It can be cured quickly and can avoid infecting the wife, which is a win-win situation. In case you have been misled by quack doctors and inferior medicines and turned to chronic gonorrhea, you must not fail to treat it early.</p>
<p>As for the treatment method, according to my many years of experience, only the special drug for gonorrhea "Kerinon" has the most excellent effect, because this drug uses non-specific therapy, and is made of a mixture of protein and pigments. After taking it, it can produce an anti-gonorrhea phagocytic effect within a few hours, and can have a direct bactericidal effect on the lesion without hindering other healthy parts. I also use German sensory static electricity therapy and German anti-gonorrhea blood serum, and the results are all expected. If the wife is also infected and has gonorrheal leucorrhea, in addition to taking "Kerinon" internally, you can also use "Car Er Xue Di Vaginal Tablets" externally as a suppository, which can also achieve the same effect and restore the happiness between husband and wife. Consultation time: 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM Every day, 20 numbers are sent for consultation, and each number only costs 5 jiao and a full book on sexually transmitted diseases is given as a gift.</p>

<h3>Foreign Commentators Briefly Describe: China's Finances are Solid, National Banks Fulfill Wartime Tasks, and the People Support National Policies and Donate Generously</h3>
<p>China's wartime finance has a solid foundation. For two years of the War of Resistance, it has been able to cope with it comfortably. According to foreign commentators, the reasons for the stability of China's wartime finance are: (1) China is still largely an agricultural society. The economic foundation lies in the broad countryside. A self-sufficient economic life exists everywhere in mainland China, so it is not as deeply affected by the war as industrialized countries. (2) The Chinese people are industrious and hardworking, and their living standards are very low, so they can all endure temporary pain. (3) Financial policies are appropriate, and financial institutions are becoming more and more comprehensive. For example, controlling foreign exchange, stabilizing the currency system, and achieving macro-effects. National banks can also fulfill wartime tasks under the overall national policy. (4) The promotion of foreign trade has increased exports of important Chinese products such as tung oil, tea, bristles, and medicinal materials compared to before the war. The European War still does not affect exports, which is of great benefit to the war economy. (5) Although China is at war, the people are motivated by patriotism and can still pay various donations and taxes as usual, even in areas adjacent to the war zone. The government has also not created new taxes under the pretext of wartime. Although there are excessive profits tax and inheritance tax after the war, they are taken from those who have the resources and are fair good taxes. In addition, the Chinese government has issued a number of value bonds, which have been deeply recognized and purchased by domestic and overseas Chinese, and automatic donations are also very enthusiastic.</p>
<h3>American Ambassador: Leaves Beiping for Shanghai Today</h3>

<h3>Starting Tomorrow: Relief for Hidden Poor, Distribution of Steamed Buns, Number Increases Sharply</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Charity Federation has scheduled to start relief for the hidden poor tomorrow, distributing rice tickets secretly and preparing cotton-padded clothes and quilts. Since the association started distributing steamed buns and ginger soup every night in the Dagu Road area on the 9th of this month, the number of poor people receiving relief has gradually increased to more than 3,000 per day. According to the number of steamed buns distributed, a total of 1,680 were distributed on the 9th, 4,800 on the 10th, 7,488 on the 11th, 8,800 on the 12th, and 10,000 on the 13th.</p>
<h3>Children's Home Distributes Winter Clothes to Refugee Children on a Regular Basis, 6,000 Sets for Girls have been Made, Scheduled Distribution Dates</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Office of the China Children's Welfare Association previously held a campaign to solicit winter clothes for refugee children last year, which was enthusiastically supported by all sectors of society, and the results were quite satisfactory. After the fundraising campaign was completed, the association immediately started the procedures for bidding and ordering. It is now heard that the first batch of 6,000 sets of winter clothes have been made and distributed, and since the 13th of this month, the Chinese Sheng Gong Hui classroom has been commissioned in the Caojiadu area of this city to distribute them to refugee children in the poor shantytowns. Today (the 15th) from 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM, refugee children in the Children's Home will be distributed; on the 16th from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM, refugee children in the East District Branch of the Rickshaw Drivers Mutual Aid Association will be distributed; on the 17th from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM, refugee children in the South District Branch of the Rickshaw Drivers Mutual Aid Association will be distributed; on the 18th from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM, refugee children in the West District Branch of the Rickshaw Drivers Mutual Aid Association will be distributed.</p>
<h3>Annual Meeting of the Chinese Medical Association to Be Held Regularly in Guiyang; Shanghai Medical Association to Send Representatives to Attend</h3>
<p>The Fourth Annual Meeting of the Chinese Medical Association has been decided to be held in Kunming, from April 2nd to 5th, for a total of four days.

<h3>Japanese Currency Allowed for Purchasing Stamps; Shanghai Post Office Implements It; No Prior Report to the General Administration; Poorly Considered Measures Difficult to Implement; It is Said That the Occupied Areas of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Chongqing Are Also Collecting and Using It Simultaneously</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Administration issued Notice No. 1598 on the 9th of this month, allowing the purchase of stamps with Japanese currency or Japanese military scrip. The bureau may accept it at an exchange rate of one Japanese yen (i.e., one hundred sen) equaling 1.25 yuan in legal tender, effective today. However, all sectors are paying close attention. It is understood that this matter was unilaterally decided by the French Postal Director of the Bureau, Chapeleau, and the Japanese Deputy Postal Director, Kaneji Kin'ichiro, without the approval of Guo Xinshong, Director of the Kunming Postal General Administration of the Ministry of Communications. Therefore, the General Administration has not yet been informed of this matter. However, it is generally believed that this measure by the post office has the suspicion of promoting the power of the Japanese yen, so all sectors are determined not to accept Japanese currency or Japanese military scrip when purchasing stamps.</p>
<p>(Airmail Rates Also Changed)</p>
<p>Regarding the airmail rates required for airmail to Japan and North and Central China, new regulations have been set and will also be implemented today. (A) Airmail rates for air routes from Shanghai and Nanjing to Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and other Japanese territories: (1) Letters: 44 fen in national currency or 35 sen in Japanese currency per 20 grams or fraction thereof; (2) Postcards: 22.5 fen in national currency or 18 sen in Japanese currency per card; (3) Other mail: 94 fen in national currency or 75 sen in Japanese currency per 60 grams or fraction thereof; (B) Airmail rates for air routes from Shanghai, Nanjing, and Beiping to North China and from Shanghai, Nanjing, and Hankou to Central China (up to Hankou): (1) Letters: 25 fen in national currency or 20 sen in Japanese currency per 20 grams or fraction thereof; (2) Postcards: 12.5 fen in national currency or 10 sen in Japanese currency per card.</p>
<p>(Exchange Rate Set According to Market Regulations)</p>
<p>The bureau stated that the above method of converting national currency to Japanese currency is not fixed and will be determined at any time according to market value fluctuations. However, according to the opinions of the general postal community, the post office's sudden permission to purchase stamps with Japanese currency is tantamount to indirectly promoting the Japanese yen. Therefore, the above measures of the Shanghai Post Office are considered to be lacking in consideration. Furthermore, according to a Datong News Agency reporter's investigation, the post offices in the occupied areas of Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces have all decided to start collecting and using Japanese currency and Japanese military scrip today. The Shanghai Postal Authority has dispatched Japanese low-ranking inspectors to inspect the implementation of the purchase of stamps with Japanese currency and its exchange rate in the post offices in the occupied areas, and whether there are any difficulties.</p>
<p>Muslim Youth Celebrate Festival</p>
<p>The 20th of this month is the Muslim Eid al-Adha (Sacrifice Festival). Wealthy Muslims from all over the world gather in Mecca to worship the Kaaba. After completing the pilgrimage, they slaughter livestock and distribute it to relatives, friends, and poor believers. Those who cannot go to the Kaaba can hold worship ceremonies in mosques everywhere and slaughter livestock to distribute to relatives and friends. Muslims in Shanghai also gathered in various mosques on the morning of that day. In view of the fact that there are still more than 100,000 refugees in Shanghai awaiting relief, some Muslim youths have specifically organized a Muslim youth dinner party on this day, and invited imams to give lectures on religious doctrines, and all the remaining funds from the dinner party on that day will be donated to refugees. Any Muslim youth in Shanghai who wish to participate at that time can quickly send a letter to No. 33 Seymour Road to ensure delivery.</p>
<h3>Strike at Japanese Public Bus Company; Drivers and Female Ticket Sellers Demand Subsidies Unsuccessfully, Leading to Strike</h3>
<p>According to the Continental News, the Huazhong Public Bus Company, a Japanese company operating in the public concession north of the Suzhou River and Zhabei, has recently experienced a strike. Some of the company's drivers and female ticket sellers demanded subsidies due to the high cost of living, but were unsuccessful, so they went on strike on the morning of last Thursday. It is reported that the company does not intend to reconcile, ordering employees who remain in their positions to work harder, and even dispatching office workers to act as drivers. Those who are unfamiliar with driving are acting as ticket sellers.</p>
<h3>Four Giant Ships Managed by Tianxiang to Change Routes Between Europe and the Far East; Other Giant Ships to Replace Routes Between the Far East and New York; All Ships Fly the Norwegian Flag and Have a Good Reputation</h3>
<p>According to the Continental News, Tianxiang Shipping Company in Shanghai announced that four of the five old ships managed by the company operating between New York and the Far East have changed routes between Europe and the Far East, and will be replaced by four 10,000-ton ships from the Norwegian Williamson Shipping Company.</p>
<p>Three ships operating between New York and the Far East, the Talisman, the Thamesis, and the Torrens, are newly built and have sailed from Norway to Shanghai for their maiden voyages. The fourth ship, the Titania, was built earlier and previously sailed in European waters. The Titania left Shanghai in November last year and has arrived in New York. The Talisman arrived in Shanghai from Norway earlier in November and began operations, arriving in Lausanne. The Thamesis and the Torrens are scheduled to depart from Shanghai on the 21st of this month and the 20th of February, respectively. Only the Taoyang, an old ship of the company, still operates on this route. All ships fly the Norwegian flag and are among the few giant ships operating in the Far East, also capable of carrying 12 passengers.</p>
<h3>The Financial Sector Should Abandon Selfish Interests; Discrepancies Between Exchange Remittances and Surcharges Contradict Principles; Hoarding Cash Affects the Economy</h3>
<p>After the fall of Shanghai, because funds from the interior concentrated in Shanghai and there was a lack of legitimate investment channels, speculation flourished. Foreign exchange, bids, public bonds, cotton yarn, rice, and grains were all objects of speculation. Eventually, foreign exchange depreciated sharply, from a price of eight to four. Other prices also broke through unprecedented records under the promotion of speculative waves. The price of one stone of white rice reached 40 yuan. People were unable to make a living, and cries of sorrow were everywhere. Social security was threatened, and national morality was almost completely degraded. The harm to the future of the War of Resistance is not insignificant. The Ministry of Finance's Ma telegram restricting the payment of deposits aims to stabilize the foundation of finance and eliminate the atmosphere of market speculation. However, it is heard that some who do not understand the situation are using certain institutions to hoard cash, engaging in the operation of their own interests. As for the exchange surcharge, in financial principles and the country's wartime financial policy, this should not happen. The government's measures to stabilize finance, and Ma's telegram restricting withdrawals, aim to prevent the escape of funds and stabilize the financial market. However, the occurrence of white exchange surcharges in Shanghai has caused the market's chips to have different values. The government's power is temporarily insufficient, causing a surcharge to be created in the market for no reason. Those who seek profit cannot prevent the escape of funds, but only allow a few people to manipulate it, seeking profits through surcharges. As for the government's wartime financial policy, it is very sound and thorough, and its protection of finance is benevolent and righteous. With the start of southwest construction, the movement to transfer capital to the interior is fierce, and the promotion of various savings campaigns aims to concentrate national strength and support the war situation. If all Chinese citizens are forced by the environment and cannot transfer a large amount of capital to the interior, they must not use wartime financial phenomena and overemphasize private interests, so as to affect the entire social economy.</p>
<h3>Sudden Increase in Fares for Passenger Ships of Various Countries</h3>
<p>In the past six months, the passenger ships of various countries operating on the Far East route have recently increased their fares accordingly due to the high price of coal and rising prices. Passenger ticket prices have increased by more than one-third compared to before the war. Recently, overseas Chinese returning from Europe have gathered in France to take French ships to China because they are aware of the excessive burden of travel expenses, as French ships have the cheapest fares compared to passenger ships of various countries. However, according to overseas Chinese returning home, the current fares of French mail ships, the lowest class of general cabins, have increased a lot compared to before the war. Before the war, the fourth-class fare was only 16 pounds per person, but after the war, it gradually increased and has now risen to 25 pounds per person, equivalent to more than 1,100 yuan in Chinese legal currency. It is also heard that after January, it will increase again to 35 pounds per person.</p>
<h3>Restrictions on Carrying Cigarettes for Passengers Going to Ningbo</h3>
<p>The Ningbo Inspection Office stipulates that each foreign passenger must not carry more than 100 cigarettes or 50 cigars. The container must be unsealed. If the amount is reached, even if it is a small number, it must be detained and transferred to the Cigarette Management Office, and the crime will be punished as private smuggling.</p>
<h3>Huang Qingping, Owner of Hengji Public Rice Shop, Kidnapped Yesterday; Traveling by Chartered Car Through Avenue Edward VII, Suddenly Intercepted and Abducted by Four Men</h3>
<p>At 11:35 yesterday morning, a kidnapping occurred on Avenue Edward VII at the junction of the British and French concessions. The victim was Huang Qingping (also known as Ju Sheng, 49 years old), a rice broker and owner of Hengji Public Rice Shop at 25 Bailinan Road in Pudong. At the time, Huang had just returned from listening to market conditions at the Qinglian Pavilion Rice Market on Simalu and was returning to his residence at No. 3, Lane 1292, Chongqing Road, Avenue Edward VII, for dinner in his own chartered car. Unexpectedly, when he arrived in front of the Dahua Dance Hall at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Route Belles in the French Concession, four men who had been lying in wait there forced him into a car, No. 3697, parked on the corner of the road, and sped west. When the driver of the chartered car, Ding Afu from Jiangbei, saw this, he rushed back home to report. After Huang's daughter, Huang Ruxin, reported the situation to the Public Concession Police, they dispatched detectives to strictly investigate Huang's whereabouts. As the incident occurred in the French Concession, they notified the French Police. The French Police also received a report at the time and urgently notified all police posts to pay attention to the car. The Chief of the Criminal Division, Wan Langdeng, also ordered an investigation.</p>
<h3>General Closing Period Approaching; Various Industries Begin Preparations; Qianye (Money Exchange) Industry Plans to Formulate Business Handling Plan; Accommodating Overdrafts on Transactions</h3>
<p>Since the Qianye Industry Association decided that February 7th would be the general closing period for the 28th year of the Republic of China, various industries have already begun preparations for the general closing, such as collecting customer accounts, temporarily suspending new accounts, allocating funds, and waiting. The Qianye Industry Association has scheduled an executive committee meeting on the 25th of this month to formulate a business handling plan for before and after the general closing period, and then submit it to the members' standing committee meeting on February 2nd for implementation. As for the transaction amounts that have been released by various banks, according to past practice, all debts must be cleared before the general closing. Now, in order to support the national goods industry, accommodation will be granted to domestic goods factories and firms. A four-day holiday is scheduled from February 8th to handle the general closing, and business will resume on the 12th. As for the Shanghai financial market, it remains stable as ever. The money market for foreign exchange has no signs of tension, so there is no problem for various industries to safely pass the general closing period.</p>
<h3>Public Concession Factories Employ 210,000 Workers</h3>
<p>According to the Municipal Council, the total number of workers employed by Chinese and foreign factories in the Public Concession and the extra-territorial road construction areas in western Shanghai last month was 211,500, an increase of 62,040 compared to 149,460 in the same month of the previous year. In terms of factories, there are more than 160 more than the previous month, and up to 1,000 more than the same period of the previous year, but most of them are small industries.</p>

<p>General Wu Fuwei passed away suddenly on December 4th last year due to a minor tooth ailment at his residence in Shijin Garden, Beiping. The news shocked the country. After the Lugou Bridge Incident, General Wu resided in Ping until last year. A certain party wanted to win him over at all costs, using both enticements and threats. The General did not dishonor his integrity and was loyal to the country. While resting quietly in his residence in the old capital and devoting himself to self-cultivation, he passed away unexpectedly. The country has lost this pillar, and everyone mourns and regrets. It is learned that Wu's residence in Beiping is scheduled to move the coffin to Nianhua Temple in Beiping on the 24th of this month, and then choose a auspicious day to return the coffin to his ancestral home in Penglai, Shandong, for burial.</p>

<p>Brief Biography of General Fuwei</p>
<p>General Wu Fuwei, whose name is Peifu and courtesy name is Ziyu, was from Penglai, Shandong. He was 66 years old. He joined the army early and traveled in the military for 40 years. During the Sino-Japanese War, he studied at the Kaiping Military Academy and then graduated from the Baoding Surveying and Mapping Hall. He served in the Wuwei Army guarding Gubeikou and served as a Yantai Commissioner in the Staff Office of the Beiyang Army. He was later appreciated by former President Cao Kun and appointed Deputy Inspector of Zhili, Shandong, and Henan and Inspector of Hubei, Hunan, Zhili, Shandong, and Henan, and awarded the title of General Fuwei, Army General.

<h3>Nanshi to Become the Second "Bad Land"; Opening of Two Iron Gates Unconfirmed; But Local Gangs and Gambling Dens Have Already Obtained Fake Licenses</h3>
<p>The "Citizen Certificate" issued by the Nanshi Chinese Office has recently been suddenly banned by the Japanese. Outsiders who do not know the inside story have made many speculations. It is heard that the Japanese Nanshi Special Affairs Agency has scheduled a meeting today to discuss remedial measures for the banned "Citizen Certificate." As for the rumor that the Xinbeimen and Nanyangqiao iron gates will be opened today (the 15th), it has not been confirmed. According to the Japanese, the date is not far off. It is heard that before the opening of the iron gates in Nanshi, the Japanese puppet agents have already obtained many licenses for local gangs, gambling tables, flower clubs, and listening devices, with as many as twenty or thirty licenses each. A large number of rogues and local bullies are working hard to secure them. It is expected that after Nanshi is opened in the near future, it will become the second "bad land" of western Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Summary of Important Administrative Matters of the Municipal Council in 1939 (Continued)</h3>
<p>Gazette Published Once a Month</p>
<p>Regarding the printing and distribution of the Council's Gazette, although foreign taxpayers raised opinions at the annual meeting, the Council organized a special committee to review the matter. As a result, it was considered that the current methods adopted by the Council were not inappropriate and did not need to be changed. Subsequently, at the end of the year, it was decided to change the Gazette to be published once a month from the beginning of this year, but the information on municipal affairs would not be less than in the past.</p>
<p>Relocation of British Army Remains to Hongqiao</p>
<p>The remains of British soldiers who died in battle during the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom period in the late Qing Dynasty were buried in the Nanshi Cemetery. In the past, the Council decided to relocate all coffins to the Hongqiao Cemetery. This section has been stated in the Council's annual report of the previous year. The relocation work was completed last year, and a monument was erected on the new cemetery.</p>
<p>Collection of Refugee Donations and Allocation of Uses</p>
<p>Last year, refugee donations continued to be collected at various entertainment venues, and the total amount paid to the Council throughout the year was 356,841.33 yuan. Together with the balance of 35,647.34 yuan carried over from the previous year, and the remainder of 53,684.41 yuan from the rice sales surplus, the total of the two figures was 446,353.08 yuan, which could be used to relieve refugees. The Joint Committee of Shanghai Foreign Charities requested to allocate 20% of this entertainment donation. The Council approved this, and decided that after deducting the expenses incurred by various departments of the Council for undertaking relief work and setting aside a part of the reserve fund, 80% of the remaining amount would be allocated to the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, and 20% would be supplied to the Joint Committee of Shanghai Foreign Charities. As of the end of November, the relief funds allocated totaled 380,869.79 yuan.</p>
<p>Restrictions on Placing Coffins in Funeral Homes</p>
<p>At the beginning of last year, the issue of coffin placement homes within the Concession was still extremely complex. There were many applications to establish coffin placement homes in the residential areas of western Shanghai. These petitions were all rejected. As for those that had been opened before, they could not be arbitrarily expanded. A certain coffin placement home was ordered by the Council to demolish unauthorized buildings. New coffin placement wooden houses were built around the roads outside the western district, and their locations were also restricted by the Council.</p>
<p>Rickshaw Rent Not Allowed to Increase</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of public rickshaw fares, the Council organized a special committee at the beginning of last year to review the request submitted by the Rickshaw Industry Association and consider various related facts. As a result, the Council Board approved the committee's proposal not to allow an increase in fares. However, this issue was raised again for consideration at the end of the year.</p>
<p>Temple Fair</p>
<p>Last year's Jing'an Temple Fair was still held on private grounds on Great Western Road to avoid crowds.</p>
<p>Service Awards for Fire Department</p>
<p>The Council decided to award a long service medal to the volunteer reserve team of the fire brigade, with conditions similar to those for the long service medals of the Volunteer Corps and the Special Police. Fire department staff who have served for 20 years and are capable may also be awarded medals by the Council.</p>
<p>Consular Court Hears Two Cases</p>
<p>At the beginning of last year, the US Consul General Gauss, the British Consul General Felippo, and the Japanese Consul General Miura were elected as judges of the Consular Court, with Gauss as the President of the Court. Between October and November, the Consular Court heard a case against a former detective of the Police Department for dismantling the Council. The detective was dismissed by the Bureau for violating regulations, losing part of his accumulated retirement pay. The Consular Court then ruled to return the case to the Bureau for consideration of changing the punishment. The Bureau has followed the court's handling. Between November and December, another case against a former Russian team member of the Volunteer Corps for dismantling the Council was also accepted by the Consular Court, but the trial was not concluded by the end of the year.</p>
<p>Changes in Senior Staff</p>
<p>The Council's former Secretary-General Feixindun retired on June 30th last year. Foreign taxpayers expressed their praise to Feixindun at the annual meeting held in the spring. Felippo, the Council's General Office, was promoted to the position of General Office and Secretary-General from July 1st last year. Major Ford, the former Director of the Finance Department of the Council, retired after serving his term on June 12th last year. Foreign taxpayers also gave a eulogy to Ford at the annual meeting. He was promoted from June 13th. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Airmail Postage in Occupied Areas to Increase from Today</h3>
<p>Airmail to Anqing, Jiujiang, Wuhu, Hankou, Wuchang, Beiping, Tianjin, Jinan, Datong, Zhangjiakou, Shanhaiguan, Qingdao, Tongshan, Xuzhou, Bengbu, Shijiazhuang, Taiyuan, Zhangde, and Kaifeng, the flat rate was originally 5 cents, including the airmail fee of 2 jiao, totaling 2 jiao 5 fen. The Shanghai Postal Administration has now stipulated that from today onwards, the airmail fee will be changed to 2 jiao 5 fen, and the total with the flat rate will be 3 jiao, the same as the airmail fee to the southwest. If registered and express mail, the additional fees should be paid separately. The airmail fee to Japan will also be increased from 3 jiao 5 fen to 4 jiao 4 fen from today onwards, and the total with the flat rate will be 4 jiao 9 fen. If it exceeds 20 cm, it will be added successively. This fee increase is unrelated to the rumored postage increase.</p>
<h3>Widespread Rumor that Chen Gongbo and Others Have Gone to Hong Kong</h3>
<p>Reports from the mainland state that, according to widespread rumors in this city last night, Chen Gongbo and two others recently disagreed with Wang Jingwei. Chen reportedly departed for Hong Kong on December 31st of last year, and it is said he will not return here. The other two, Gao Zhongwu and Tao Xisheng, also reportedly followed Chen south in the days after. It is rumored that all three are now in Hong Kong. As for the reason for their disagreement, the details are unknown.</p>
<h3>Russian Emigrants in Shanghai Celebrate New Year's Day Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the Russian New Year's Day. All Russian emigrants in Shanghai celebrated enthusiastically. The Russian New Year differs from that of other countries due to customs, much like the Chinese Lunar New Year. The Russian Christmas falls on January 8th, while the New Year is on January 14th. Russian churches also held celebrations and commemorations as usual yesterday.</p>
<h3>Suggestions for Suppressing Rice Prices: Legal and Administrative Measures Should Be Taken Simultaneously, with the Joint Efforts of the Authorities and Residents</h3>
<p>— Li</p>
<p>Since the authorities of the two concessions restricted rice prices and issued public notices stating that anyone found monopolizing or manipulating the market would not be protected, and their hoarded goods would be confiscated, the measures can be said to be quite strict. At the same time, public figures concerned about the people's food have organized a Food Adjustment Association, trying to raise funds to order foreign rice to curb the ambitions of monopolizers and manipulators. For a time, rice prices on the surface did not exceed the limited price. However, in reality, it was still loose on the surface but tight underneath. It can be seen that these conscienceless rice weevils are still operating secretly. If members of society only complain about the high price of rice and do not work together to try to eat cheap rice, I am afraid that relying solely on the Food Adjustment Association to order foreign rice will not achieve the goal in this period of high foreign exchange rates. But what is the right approach? According to my personal opinion:</p>
<p>(1) Establish more rice distribution points at low prices. The matter of transporting and selling foreign rice is now being handled by the Food Adjustment Association. However, for ordinary people, it is not easy to come up with half of the fixed price of a bag of rice at once, so they still cannot enjoy the benefits. It is necessary to set up as many low-price distribution points as possible in suitable locations to meet the needs of all parties, so that the rice weevils' rice will always be hoarded in warehouses. Except for being moth-eaten and moldy, or being sold at a low price according to the estimated value, no one will bother with it. Then the rice weevils will naturally feel that they have nowhere to sell their tricks and will no longer hoard. Although it is well known that domestic rice-producing areas have had an unusually good harvest this year, why order foreign rice and settle the bill in foreign exchange? Isn't the price almost the same as that of domestic rice? But it should be known that domestic rice is not so expensive in the producing areas. It is rumored that the price of rice in Wuhu differs greatly across the river. On one side, it costs about 20 yuan per dan, while on the other, it is less than 10 yuan. The difference is so great, and it can be understood that the reason is whether or not it is controlled by special forces. As for shipping it to Shanghai, a procurement certificate from special forces is also required, but it can only be shipped to Hongkou. If you want to move it south of the Suzhou Creek, you still need to find a way. Therefore, even if the rice weevils try to raise the price of rice and calculate the benefits, it is far less than the embezzlement of special forces. The more money these embezzlers get, the more Chinese compatriots die tragically. The bombing of several places, the planes and bombs, are largely made possible by this kind of money. Then, while eating expensive domestic rice, we still have to suffer cruel harm. It is better to eat foreign rice and be at peace physically and mentally. This is originally a last resort. Unless a person is insane, how can they willingly let rights leak out? (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Plainclothes Chinese Detectives Commit Robbery, A Glove with a Detective Number is Left Behind, Arrest, Dismissal, Interrogation, and Summons for Further Interrogation</h3>
<p>Wu Shaorong, a native of Haimen, who lives in a bungalow with no number on Teisdelang Road in the French Concession's West District, was suddenly broken into by a bandit at 7:00 PM on December 1st of last year. The bandit, holding a flashlight and pretending to have a handgun, forbade any outcry. The bandit then rummaged through the boxes and cabinets, stealing over thirty yuan in cash and slapping Wu's wife before fleeing. Afterwards, the victim, Wu Shaorong, found a black velvet thread</p>
<p>glove</p>
<p>left behind by the bandit.</p>
<p>He took the glove to the French police station to report the incident and request an investigation. The detective chief found number 1033 inside the glove, which belonged to Chinese detective Gao Guangyi, number 1033. The detective was brought in for questioning. He confessed that Chinese detective number 1022, who lives near the victim's home, went to find him that night. Number 1022's wife said that he was in the victim's house. However, when the detective chief went to look, he could not find number 1022, but only saw the victim's daughter and others playing mahjong. He then confiscated a mahjong score sheet.</p>
<p>The detective chief investigated</p>
<p>and found that Chinese detective number 1022 had already been dismissed for misconduct. He then ordered the dismissal and detention of Chinese detective Gao Guangyi, number 1033. The day before yesterday afternoon, Gao was sent to the First Criminal Division of the Special Second Court, where Judge Miao Qingbang interrogated him. Police lawyer Yuan Jiahuang explained the case and requested a postponement for investigation. Then, the plaintiff, Wu Shaorong, recounted the circumstances of the robbery. Gao's testimony was the same as that given at the police station, denying the robbery. The court reviewed the testimonies and ordered a postponement to summon witnesses for further interrogation on the morning of the 23rd at 9:00 AM. The defendant was detained.</p>
<h3>Counterfeiters Receive Separate Sentences</h3>
<p>Chinese Detective Wang Chengying, Detective Xu Decheng, and Detective Xia Shutang of the Gordon Road Police Station received a tip from an informant on the 22nd of last month and cracked a case involving Shandong native Zhang Keqin, Liu Xueke, and Tianjin native Liu Jizhong, who were selling large quantities of counterfeit banknotes at No. 12, Lane 66, Beijing Road, and No. 36, Taianli, Tiantong Road. 2,660 counterfeit banknotes of Farmers Bank, Communications Bank, and Central Bank, each valued at five yuan, were confiscated, along with suspects Pan Wenbao from Pudong, a woman named Liu Sunshi, and others. They were taken to the police station and sent to the First Special District Court. The four suspects, including Pan Wenbao, hired lawyer Yu Enliang to defend them. The defendant Zhang Keqin confessed that Zhang Baolin and Cao Zida, who are at large, were the masterminds of the case. Each defendant was ordered to be returned to custody to await sentencing. The day before yesterday, Judge Huang Risheng presided over the trial and sentenced Zhang Keqin to eight years of imprisonment, Liu Xueke to five years, and Liu Jizhong to three years and six months, as warnings. Pan Wenbao, Liu Sunshi, and Zhang Wangshi were all acquitted and released. The confiscated counterfeit banknotes were confiscated and destroyed according to the list.</p>
<h3>A Rogue Who Dined and Dashed Stabs a Waiter to Death</h3>
<p>Chuan Hebing, a waiter from Wuxi at the Dongsheng Restaurant at No. 18 North Shansi Road, had a quarrel with rogues near the Suzhou Creek Pier because they refused to pay for food and drinks. This led to resentment. At 1:45 PM on the 8th of this month, Chuan went out on business and was attacked by these rogues near the pier, who stabbed him fatally with a triangular knife. Afterwards, Chinese detectives Shang Wu and Zhu Mengwei of the Hui Police Station investigated and arrested the murderers Zhang Xueheng from Jiangbei, Cheng Lianguan from Changzhou, and Liu Jirong, all of whom were young rogues. A triangular knife discarded by Zhang was also retrieved from the Suzhou Creek. They were sent to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention. The day before yesterday morning, Judge Huang Risheng presided over the trial and, after a clear investigation, ordered them to be returned to custody to await sentencing.</p>
<h3>Major Drug Case at Roosevelt Wharf: Police Strictly Arresting the Masterminds, Crackdown on an Organization in Baoxingli, A Total of Thirteen Arrests</h3>
<p>At around 11 PM on the 28th of last month, the French Concession Police Department cracked a major drug case at Roosevelt Wharf No. 5 (previously mistakenly reported as Taikoo Wharf No. 3). At the time, a total of 160 kilograms of opium were seized, totaling 2,460 taels, worth</p>
<p>over ten thousand yuan.</p>
<p>Three suspects were arrested at the scene and taken to the police station for a thorough investigation. Due to the seriousness of the case, the details were not disclosed. According to the news reporter's investigation, the three arrested at the time were Yang Tianxiang (Shandong), Li Huaian (Tianjin), and Ma Ji (Shandong), all of whom were arrested for picking up the opium at the wharf. After interrogation, they confessed that the main organization was located in the French Concession</p>
<p>inside Baoxingli</p>
<p>at No. 32. The police sent detectives there and arrested ten staff members: Li Shufang, Wang Jinhai, Wen Xingren, Wang Chunnian, Guo Zhiyuan, Sun Zhaozhong, Wu Zhengrong, Wu Wanxiang, Chen Yushan, and Liu Baolai. Account books and other items were confiscated. After a thorough interrogation, it was found that there were still</p>
<p>important masterminds</p>
<p>Li Jian (Shandong) and a Western foreigner, who had already been interrogated and escaped. The police have now issued strict orders for their arrest. It is now known that the police sent the above thirteen suspects and the seized opium to the First Criminal Division of the Special Second Court the day before yesterday. Police lawyer Yuan Jiahuang gave an account of the proceedings, stating that because the case</p>
<p>situation is complicated</p>
<p>and the fleeing masterminds still need to be arrested, a postponement was requested. Presiding Judge Miao Qingbang reviewed the submissions and briefly interrogated each suspect before ordering a postponement to the 27th of this month for interrogation. The defendants were returned to custody.</p>
<h3>Butcher Shop Employee Stabs a Vendor to Death</h3>
<p>Liu Chubao, a 25-year-old from Jiangbei, who lived at No. 5, Lane 31, Seymour Road, made a living selling beef at the vegetable market. At 10:15 AM yesterday, Sai Shipai (28), an employee of a butcher shop from Anhui, went to Liu's stall to collect a debt. The two began to argue. Sai, in a fit of anger, grabbed a beef-cutting knife from the stall and stabbed Liu in the head several times, causing injuries to the right neck and back of the head, causing heavy bleeding. Liu fell to the ground in pain. Afterwards, the police arrived and arrested Sai. The injured was sent to Baolong Hospital, where he died at 3:30 PM after failing to respond to treatment.</p>
<h3>Moral Re-Armament Representative from Burma to Broadcast Tonight at the Gospel Radio Station</h3>
<p>Since the completion of the Burma Road, Burma has become a close neighbor to our country and an important route for foreign transportation during the war. Recently, the Burmese delegation came to China, and the people of Chongqing welcomed them warmly. The close relationship between the two countries is evident. The World Moral Re-Armament Assembly will be held in the United States this time, and Ms. Ma Ningtai, a representative from Burma, traveled a long way to attend. Ms. Ma has traveled to Europe and the United States several times, and her moral cultivation is very profound, and she is respected by representatives from various countries. After the meeting in the United States, she first went to Japan on her way back to promote the Moral Re-Armament movement. It is said that many Japanese aristocrats have been changed under her guidance. For example, a certain baron's family can gather with their children and servants every morning to reflect on themselves. In large stores in Tokyo, all employees gather together every morning to listen to God quietly. Ms. Ma has now come to Shanghai and will carry out Moral Re-Armament work in the free areas of China and other Asian countries. Tonight (the 15th) at 7:30 PM, during the time when Dr. Wang Wanbai gives a lecture on the Gospel Radio Station (frequency 760), Ms. Ma Ningtai will be invited to broadcast a speech.</p>
<h3>French Public Works Bureau Employee, Bureau Staff Member, and Driver Arrested for Impersonation and Fraud</h3>
<p>Ge Jianfeng, 24, from Ningbo, worked as a driver for a Westerner in the French Public Works Bureau. Recently, he impersonated a health inspection officer and demanded five yuan from Wang Jinlong's small factory at No. 100 Caishi Street under the guise of an inspection. A few days ago, he demanded ten yuan from Wang again, but Wang discovered that Ge was an imposter and reported him to the French police. The police arrested Ge, and the day before yesterday, he was sent to the First Division of the Second Special Court. The police lawyer explained the case and requested a postponement for investigation. The defendant admitted the impersonation and fraud. Judge Miao reviewed the confession and ordered a postponement for further investigation. The defendant was detained.</p>
<h3>Palm and its Products are Prohibited from Transportation</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Economic Affairs telegraphed the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, stating that palm trees do not belong to the hemp category in botany. As for palm and its products, the Ministry of Military Affairs was telegraphed to check whether they had military uses. The Ministry of Military Affairs has now telegraphed back that palm and its products are related to military use and should be prohibited from transportation to avoid supplying the enemy. All trade associations are hereby informed.</p>
<h3>Social Miscellany</h3>
<p>At the Hengfeng Dyeing and Weaving Factory on Maran Road in the French Concession, at around noon yesterday, two workers, Jiang Maoyin, 32, and Shi Ayun, 20, both from Ningbo, were using a machine to starch cloth in the cloth room when the axle derailed. The two were knocked to the ground. Jiang's hands were crushed, and Shi's left leg was crushed. Bleeding was unstoppable. The factory sent them to the hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>Chinese and Western detectives from the Hui Police Station received a tip that several bandits were hiding in the Nanyang Hotel at No. 294 North Zhejiang Road. So at noon the day before yesterday, they secretly went to the address and arrested five people: Zhang Haihai, Cai Daodao, Wang Ajin, Tang Guien, and Zhang Agen, all from Tongzhou. A fake handgun was confiscated. They were all taken to the police station. The day before yesterday, they were sent to the First Special Court for detention. Judge Huang ordered a postponement for one week for further verification.</p>
<p>Qian Zhiyu, a farmer from Xiaolijiashai, Luobiegen Road, West Shanghai, accidentally started a fire while cooking dinner at around 7:00 PM the night before last.

<p>The cooked water industry understands the greater good and denies price increases.</p>
<h3>The Cooked Water Industry Understands the Greater Good and Denies Price Increases. For the Convenience of the Public, We Will Not Seek Petty Profits.</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Cooked Water Industry Association held an emergency meeting last night, attended by over 40 representatives, directors, and supervisors from various districts. After the customary formalities, Chairman Zhang Delong reported that Ji Jianmin and Yu Liyang, who are not members of the industry, had falsely used the name of the cooked water industry to publish a price increase notice in the newspaper. The association could not find their address and its legal advisor, Yin Tinghua, has repeatedly published warnings in the newspaper. Shi Xingli proposed that the association was established to seek the welfare of the public. Although coal prices have soared, we can only temporarily endure the pain and maintain business. If prices are raised again, it will increase the burden on ordinary people and have a negative impact on citizens. If households use coal briquette stoves to boil water, the direct business losses to the industry and indirectly the citizens are prone to fires, endangering everyone. The proposal was unanimously approved to resolutely oppose another price increase. Wang Zhijian then expressed his opinion, hoping that colleagues in the industry would walk on the path of light. A letter should be sent to the Citizens' Association, Taxpayers' Association, and Special District Citizens' Association and other groups, requesting assistance in purchasing coal in bulk to compensate for the losses. Yin Tingsen and others voluntarily donated money for advertising to deny another price increase.</p>
<h3>The Truth About the Heinous Crime of Bandits Plotting to Kill a Korean Woman: The Deceased's Husband is Usually Law-Abiding and Has Never Sold Drugs.</h3>
<p>Regarding yesterday's report in this newspaper about the robbery and attempted murder of a Korean woman on Father Zhaolus Road, the deceased's husband has sent a letter stating the truth as follows: To the esteemed Chief Editor of Shen Bao, I respectfully write this letter. Today, I read a news report in your newspaper about the murder of my wife, and the headline, "Extortion of Bribes Failed, Leading to Plot to Murder Drug-Dealing Korean Woman," is inconsistent with the facts. I hereby declare the following: I have been working as a ticket inspector for the British-owned Tram Company for 17 years. I have always been</p>
<p>honest and impartial</p>
<p>in my work, which is well-known. Everyone, Chinese and foreigners alike, who knows me believes this. This is the nonsense of the arrested criminal. The criminal also admitted yesterday in the First Special Court that no drugs were found in my home. This is strong evidence. If a carelessly spoken confession is used as a headline in large print, then I will be unjustly wronged, and the loss to my reputation will be irreparable for generations. After my wife was murdered, there was not a single cent left in the house to pay for the funeral. I borrowed 300 yuan from the Tram Company. In addition, friends and others, because I am usually law-abiding and rely solely on my monthly salary of 100 yuan from the company to make a living, know that I must be in great difficulty after this tragedy. They generously offered their help, so I was able to raise more than 600 yuan to complete the funeral arrangements.</p>
<p>My heart is still in pain</p>
<p>and has not been eased. If my family were indeed drug dealers, our finances would not be so difficult. Also, the report said that the Gao surnamed criminal had been hired by my family and then dismissed, which is also completely inaccurate. I have only hired female servants many years ago and have never hired male servants at all. Moreover, in recent years, due to salary cuts in the company, income has not covered expenses, and my wife has personally handled everything in the house without hiring a female servant. The case is currently under trial in the Second Special Court.</p>
<p>The full details will come to light in the future. However, I am sincerely afraid that the outside world will misunderstand the truth. I hereby specially send this letter, requesting that it be published in an important position, like a news report, so that the truth can be clarified for all. I wish you good health. Luo Yu respectfully writes, January 14th. Also, the report said that I am Luo Quexin. Luo Quexin is the name of my murdered wife, and my name is Luo Yu. This is hereby corrected.</p>

<h3>The Spirit of Mutual Assistance in the Four Matters of Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation and the Enjoyment of Life</h3>
<p>— Letian</p>
<p>—Like "Good Scenery" Doesn't Cost a Penny—</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the European War in September 1939, new knowledge and insights on the cultivation of the spirit in advanced Western countries have been used by world-saving heroes in a timely manner to save themselves. How could we Chinese, who have endured national disasters, and our people who have worked hard to survive, not have a color of unhappiness? However, if we think about how willpower can overcome the environment, and we feel that we can turn bad luck into good, the new method of celebrating the New Year should be different from the past. If our people are determined to assist the central government, escape danger and enter a happy environment, they should first break through the three major difficulties of "anger," "suffering," and "silence." This is the newest medicine for my compatriots to turn into good luck in the 29th year of the Republic. I happened to observe it from the Western allies of the Second European War, and I am happy to share it with others and not keep it a secret.</p>
<p>First, anger: Our Chinese proverb calls being angry "getting angry," which coincides with the Western saying. According to medical principles, very few people, regardless of gender, age, or ethnicity, are naturally angry. Anger is a temporary abnormality, mostly due to physical fatigue. "Getting angry" is like having a fever, which is the body's automatic response to the environment, just like the "safety valve" of a steam engine. When the internal heat is too full, it can automatically open the valve and release the heat. When a dog is healthy, the dog owner can stroke it at will and the dog will be happy. If the dog is injured and in pain, it will bark wildly if touched slightly. The same is true when people are too tired and "get angry." It's a pity that people who get angry generally do not admit that physical fatigue is the reason for getting angry. In general, there are two strategies for human safety. The lower strategy is to let it get angry, and the upper strategy is to reduce physical fatigue by resting. One theory is that avoiding stimulating things such as pepper can also prevent anger. Another theory is that a daily action log, writing down the words or actions that easily make the other party angry, and then reflecting on oneself so as not to get angry again, is in line with the theory of mental analysis scholars in treating diseases.</p>
<p>Second, suffering: Whenever a person encounters irresolvable suffering, such as being determined to save people and using their minds or abilities to relieve the suffering of compatriots or companions, they can often forget their own suffering. Or comparing oneself to the suffering of others makes it easier to understand one's own suffering.</p>
<p>Third, silence: In families during times of famine and chaos, men are either loyal to the country or working hard to make a living, and women are more likely to feel silent because they cannot enjoy the joy of reunion. Even worse are those who are widowed, widowed, orphaned, and lonely due to the chaos. At this time, to break through the difficulty of silence, one should first find a career or job that suits one's body and mind. People must work hard so that their spirits have a place to live, and all worries and fears will naturally have no way to occur. As for women, it is best to help others. For example, during the European War, women were knitting lines to make cold clothes for soldiers and refugees, which is a key to relieving silence.</p>
<p>There is no eternally unchanging bad luck, nor is there an eternally unchanging good luck. Misfortune and fortune depend on each other, and they circulate day and night. A new luck is coming, and when the stripping reaches its limit, it recovers. The above-mentioned three essentials of spiritual enjoyment can be shared with families in our poor country. It is said that "good scenery doesn't cost a penny."</p>
<h3>Snake Skin Handbags</h3>
<p>— Qin Jiaju</p>
<p>Longhumen is a Cantonese dish of the highest quality, and everyone has probably heard of its name for a long time. But snake skin handbags are probably still little known to people in Shanghai. This is a specialty of Haiphong. After they eat the delicious snake meat, the remaining skin is used to make handbags. Each handbag is made of about four or five pieces of snake skin with different patterns, so it is impossible to find two handbags with the same pattern. So in Haiphong, Shanghai ladies all have one in hand to show novelty. The price of this kind of handbag is not expensive, and the quality is very strong and durable, and it can also avoid getting stained, so many men also use it as a wallet. However, putting it in a bag and being too close to the body seems a little worrying. I think curious people in Shanghai must also want to get one to play with, at least to learn something. Unfortunately, I can't bring too many on the boat, otherwise it would be a very good gift to give to women.</p>
<h3>Small Tips for the Household</h3>
<p>— Shijie</p>
<p>Burn the oiled paper from a worn-out umbrella into ash, mix with sesame oil, and apply to scalds from boiling water to prevent festering.</p>
<p>After leather shoes get wet, crumple newspaper into pieces and stuff them inside. This not only absorbs moisture but also helps maintain the shoe's original shape.</p>
<p>To make socks last longer, it's best to have several pairs and change them daily. Soak the worn socks in water, rub with soap, leave for three hours, then rinse with water and dry. This not only cleans them but also prevents damage to the fibers.</p>
<p>If black canvas shoes fade, brush them with soot from the bottom of a pot using a bristle brush, and they will be as black as new.</p>
<p>If leather shoes lack shine, wipe them with lemon two or three times to make them gleam brightly.</p>
<p>New porcelainware, if boiled in saltwater, can be made durable for a long time.</p>
<h3>One Week Economic Menu</h3>
<p>— Ms. Hua Ying</p>
<p>Meat prices are outrageously expensive; pork, beef, and mutton are all two or three times more expensive than before, making them truly unaffordable. As for chicken and duck, needless to say, ordinary families don't have the luxury of eating them. Therefore, besides buying some pork and beef to shred and stir-fry each day, we must eat more vegetables. Among the vegetables, large green cabbages are delicious after being hit by frost, and there's also a type of small rosette bok choy, which can offer a change of pace. Although it may sometimes have a slightly bitter taste, if you add more sugar and oil and cook it thoroughly, the flavor isn't bad. Speaking of vegetable prices, they also cost around ten cents of subsidiary currency per pound, which is certainly different from the past, but compared to meat prices, they are still much cheaper.</p>
<p>Monday</p>
<p>Stir-fried shredded pork with dried bean curd sheets, sweet and sour fried ribbonfish, stir-fried rosette bok choy, jellyfish, pickled radish</p>
<p>Tuesday</p>
<p>Celery beef soup, cellophane noodles with white fish head, braised tofu with spinach, pickled mustard greens with soybean sprouts</p>
<p>Wednesday</p>

<h3>On Ferries</h3>
<p>— Qi Yu</p>
<p>As everyone knows, ferries are set up to compensate for the inadequacy of bridges. Usually, at wide river mouths where land transportation is convenient, the construction of bridges is a huge project or too costly, so ferries are established. A single boat regularly travels between the two banks, ferrying passengers, which is both convenient and cost-effective, and truly an important auxiliary to inland transportation.</p>
<p>The river networks of Jiangnan are crisscrossed, and transportation is relatively developed, so there are particularly many ferries. Especially in the counties of Suzhou and Wuxi, because they are close to Taihu Lake and have many harbors, ferries are everywhere. Usually, you only need to spend one copper coin to save yourself a long trek, so why not do it?</p>
<p>In modern times, with the advocacy of science and the increasing development of transportation, the use of ferries has become more widespread and complete. Taking the ferries on the Huangpu River as an example, they used to be civilian boats. Whenever the tide rose or the waves surged, the boatmen had to work hard to cross this wide river, and the passengers were terrified. But since there have been ferries, this kind of danger no longer exists.</p>
<p>But ferries are not only for ferrying people, but also for ferrying cars and trains. For example, Zhenjiang and Yangzhou are separated by a large river, but the cars on the Zhenjiang-Yangzhou highway can still travel directly because they use civilian boats to ferry them across. Another example is the pre-war direct train service between Shanghai and Pingjin. The connection between the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway and the Tianjin-Pukou Railway from Nanjing to Pukou relied on ferries in the Yangtze River. The freight cars were first driven onto the ferry, ferried to the other side, and then connected to the railway so that the freight cars could drive off. There could be no simpler way. If a bridge were to be built over the Yangtze River, how easy would that be?</p>
<p>At present, the government is actively developing the inland areas, especially highway transportation is the most important, and ferries are also a very important auxiliary, which should not be neglected.</p>
<h3>Food and Health</h3>
<p>— Cao Lingyou</p>
<p>Whether we eat properly has a great impact on our health. For the convenience of narration, I will briefly describe it in three points.</p>
<p>(1) Mood While Eating</p>
<p>Whenever and wherever you eat, you should always be filled with joy in your heart. It is absolutely harmful to the body to eat with anger or anxiety.</p>
<p>(2) Method of Eating</p>
<p>After the food enters the mouth, it should be chewed slowly and carefully, and then swallowed. The most standard chewing should be done thirty-two times. Swallowing food hard with soup or tea is not only useless, but will cause all kinds of stomach problems.</p>
<p>(3) Nutritional Value of Food</p>
<p>Food should always be distributed evenly. It is not advisable to eat one kind of dish every day, and the variety of food per meal should not be too much. Two or three kinds are the most suitable, so as not to hinder digestion. According to the research of hygienists, the nutritional value of eggs and vegetables is far above that of delicacies.</p>
<p>Dear Contributor: Thank you very much for your wonderful work in December of last year. The payment has now been settled. Please come to the accounting department from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM on the 16th to the 20th of this month, with your seal, to collect it.</p>
<h3>Ningbo's Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation</h3>
<p>— Zhu Tingyun</p>
<p>Since all the seaports were successively blockaded, Ningbo has become the only transportation line to the inland areas, and the traffic of travelers and freight is quite busy. Although Ningbo also suffered the same bombing as other places this spring, it has long been rebuilt from the rubble into a new city appearance, which is even more prosperous than before. This time, the author stayed in Ningbo for half a month and conducted a brief survey of Ningbo's clothing, food, housing, and transportation.</p>
<p>Currently, the most popular clothing in Ningbo is army uniforms in grass green and light yellow. Whether on the streets or in public places, men and women can easily be seen wearing them at any time and anywhere. Even children wear them, with cloth leggings, flat-top haircuts, and cotton overcoats, showing a spirited and enterprising attitude. In addition, short overcoats made of domestic leather are also worn by many people. As for ordinary clothes, they are indeed much simpler. Foreign clothing materials also occupy the majority, but so-called modern fashions with bare chests and arms are hard to find.</p>
<p>In terms of food, various daily necessities are indeed much cheaper. The price of rice is only more than twenty yuan per stone, which is closely related to people's livelihood. As for various vegetables, because they are closer to the countryside, they are naturally cheap. Fresh shrimp that are still jumping, winter bamboo shoots just dug out of the bamboo garden, are both fresh and cheap. However, the prices of marine fish such as fresh ribbonfish are high because fishing boats cannot export to catch fish in the waters of Zhoushan and other places, and they have to rely on Shanghai, which is indeed a matter of great sadness and indignation. The only fruits are the tangerines from Huangyan and the golden bridge, which are also delicious. Among the local products, "Ningbo rice cakes" are the most famous, followed by laver cakes, square cakes, bean paste candies, and lotus root silk candies, which are also very exquisite. As for restaurants, most of them are naturally Ningbo-style restaurants. There are also a few Anhui and Cantonese restaurants. The only one that cooks and sells Western-style pastries is "Baoshan." As for fuel, no one uses coal because coal is scarce and expensive. Therefore, they have switched to using charcoal and charcoal briquettes, so eating out in restaurants takes a lot more time. Most of the drinking water is rainwater, and most of the rest is river water, which tastes salty and is difficult to use for making tea.</p>
<p>Living in Ningbo, rent is also very cheap. The difficulty is the fear of air raids. However, since the outbreak of the war, only a limited number of houses have been destroyed by air raids. Only the bustling urban area of Zhongqiao was bombed in April of last year, but it has now been restored. Ordinary houses are mostly false three-story buildings, and there are the most of them along Zhongshan Road, almost every family is like this. In the old-fashioned houses, the paint on the parlors and rooms is very exquisite, with vermilion glossy paint, which is very magnificent. Yong lacquer has long been famous in our country. As for the hotel industry, since the freight and passenger traffic has been prosperous, it has also developed abnormally. Hotels such as Anping Hotel are equipped with water heaters and bathtubs, and the facilities are also very modern, with room rates of more than six yuan per day. As for other lower-level hotels, a double-bed room also costs two yuan, three or four cents a day, because there are so many travelers coming and going, they are often fully booked.</p>
<p>Ningbo's transportation industry was well-developed with highways and railways before the war, but after the war, these novel means of transportation were automatically destroyed. Inland transportation relies only on waterways, so "fast boats" and small steam launches bear the important task of transportation. In some shallow places, the ancient means of transportation, "bamboo rafts," are used to maintain transportation. For foreign trade, although the ships from Shanghai cannot enter the blockade line, the transshipment of civilian ships is also very convenient. Therefore, Ningbo is still an important center for foreign and inland transportation today. As for Ningbo itself, there are many rickshaws and bicycles. The road surface in the bustling urban area is also an asphalt road, but the quieter ones are completely built with crushed stones, which is not convenient for walking.</p>
<p>In short, the cost of living in Ningbo is indeed lower than that of the isolated island, and the local situation is also full of unlimited vigor.</p>

<h3>How to Organize Academic Research Groups - Can Imitate the "Reading Club" Method</h3>
<p>— Fo</p>
<p>On the 12th, after reading Mr. Xinliang's article "How We Organize Reading Clubs," I had a thought. This thought was originally ordinary and not a strange or special thought. However, this kind of reading club is still not enough, and it should be gradually and greatly expanded.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Xinliang, the reason for organizing a reading club is due to the high price of books and the extremely weak purchasing power of individuals' economic strength. Therefore, the method of collective book purchase is used to relieve the hunger for knowledge. I agree with this method one hundred and twenty points. However, I hope to organize more of this kind of reading club, the more the better. The group does not need to be too large, as it is difficult to manage. The number of people does not need to be too large, as the members are inevitably complex. Just two or thirty people in a group, up to fifty or sixty people in a group. Assuming fifty or sixty people pay a membership fee of one yuan per month, then fifty or sixty yuan of books can be purchased each month. If each person pays a membership fee of fifty cents per month, then twenty or thirty yuan of reading materials can be purchased, and there will be a lot of books to see.</p>
<p>Recently, there are many dance halls and cinemas in Shanghai, and even gambling houses and opium dens in western Shanghai are everywhere. However, it is as rare as phoenix feathers to find an academic research group. Even if there is one, it only has the meaning of publicity and lacks the spirit of research. In other words, there is only a formal organization without spiritual research. Therefore, this kind of group is not easy to develop. I hope to organize this kind of academic research group, not only limited to purchasing and reading books and newspapers, but also expanding it, such as calligraphy and painting, as well as poetry, songs, or researchers of various sciences, should also, based on their knowledge, organize this kind of academic research group.</p>
<p>After all, learning has no limits. The more you research, the more interesting it becomes. The more you research, the more inventions you make. Therefore, Mr. Ma Xiangbo once said that a college graduate is not that his studies have been completed, but that his studies have just begun. Therefore, a college graduate is like getting a key to a bookshelf, and he can arbitrarily study the books in the bookshelf. Assuming that you get this key, and you think that your studies have been satisfied, it is really a big mistake and a special mistake. This is really a wise saying. I hope that modern young people will always open this key to the bookshelf and put the books in the bookshelf into their stomachs. Do not hang this key on your body as a golden signboard, or as a stepping stone for promotion and wealth.</p>
<p>Or it may be said that there are quite a few organizations that are economical and principled to read pictures, novels, and magazines. For example, the novels and magazines rented out by bookstores, or the books lent out by circulating libraries, are also organized according to economic principles. However, it is difficult to find slightly advanced or specialized books, or to find the books that you want to read in your ideals, especially books on calligraphy and painting, it is even more difficult to rent. It is true that they have books that I don't want to read, and I want to read them, but they don't have this book. There is still no proper and complete book rental agency. Originally, there were several libraries where you could go to see them. However, now there are few such agencies. Therefore, organizing academic research groups is really required by the situation. Ambitious young people, or non-young people, should quickly organize them.</p>
<p>I hope that the people on the isolated island will take the time and money spent on pleasure, or in theaters, dance halls, and gambling halls, and spend them on academic research, turning useless into useful, and turning waste into economy. The difference cannot be measured by distance.</p>
<h3>After the Rain, the Sky is Clear</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 19: Watching Flowers and Appreciating the Moon, Building a Family; Planting Jade and Conceiving Pearls, Having Skills in Pregnancy</p>
<p>It turned out that Dr. Tang Huizhen was a religious person, so she made this argument. However, Zhu Airen also agreed with this statement, feeling that if this artificial insemination method became popular, it could be said to be a major change in ethics. Moreover, her own Women and Children's Hospital and Baby Home would probably have a direct relationship. This time, the two of them talked about the invention of artificial insemination by European and American scientists, which was also a casual conversation. What was strange was that the conversation was between two unmarried young ladies. Unmarried young ladies studying how to raise sons is truly what the ancient Chinese books said, "There is no one who learns how to raise sons before marrying." But their positions should all study this matter, because one is a female specialist and the other is the director of the Women's Hospital, how can they turn a deaf ear to it? Zhu Airen ate dinner at Tang Huizhen's house, and then returned to the hotel, but saw that the two Miss He had also returned to the hotel. They also went out in the morning. They went to the International Hotel to visit Mr. Jiang, their father's friend, to see if he had come to Shanghai. They asked at the front desk of the International Hotel, and the answer was, "Mr. Jiang will arrive tomorrow. He has already sent a telegram, and the room has been booked." Mr. Jiang was originally a regular customer of the International Hotel, so he knew as soon as he asked. The two Miss He came out of the International Hotel and went to visit several of their fellow villagers and classmates. Among the foreigners, they also knew several textile experts. They are now going to start their own textile factory, and they also want to recruit talents to help them. A textile factory also needs various specialists. That kind of textile factory needs both skilled female workers and skilled technicians. It is of course impossible to recruit those skilled female workers in Freedom Village, so it is necessary to prepare in advance. Fortunately, there are several higher textile schools and textile technical personnel training institutes in Shanghai, which are all cultivating textile talents. Higher textile schools can create technicians, and training institutes can create various textile workers. They thought: In the future, after their textile factory is established, they will also set up a textile personnel training institute near the factory site. Because the textile industry in China is becoming more and more developed, the need for textile personnel will inevitably increase in the future, and there will inevitably be a shortage of talents. Even their own factory will definitely add new technicians and new workers every year. It is estimated that their textile factory will be established in Freedom Village, and it is inevitable that they will recruit many technicians and workers from Shanghai. This can be asserted. I am afraid that it will be urgent at the temporary moment, but it must be prepared now. The two Miss He also know the teachers in these higher textile schools, so they also want to visit them and ask for advice. (227)</p>
<p>Life Survey</p>
<h3>A Reporter's Visit to a Newspaper Vendor</h3>
<p>— Zeng Zhen</p>
<p>My lifelong hobby is only books, but books are so expensive that poor kids can only rummage in book stalls or linger in newspaper stands.</p>
<p>After meeting often, I naturally became familiar with the newspaper vendors. The following is a conversation with a certain newspaper vendor. If I can't name it, let's call it an interview.</p>
<p>I didn't originally intend to talk to him. The motive arose after seeing him, because I didn't think he looked like an ordinary newspaper vendor: he was tall and slender, but a little thin. He was wearing a worn-out suit, and his feet were in broken leather shoes that were about to come apart. He had a long face and a very clean appearance. Moreover, when I approached the newspaper stand, he was reading a book, which was "×× Economics."</p>
<p>I took a magazine from the bookshelf and flipped through it randomly for a while. He also glanced at me, so I started a conversation with him.</p>
<p>"Is there a discount on this magazine?"</p>
<p>"Sir, this magazine has to be sold at the real price, because I only get 20% off when I buy it myself." He explained kindly, without any unhappy look, and his words were very frank and straightforward. I continued to ask him:</p>
<p>"Can you reduce the price a little?"</p>
<p>"I can't, because we can't earn much money at the real price."</p>
<p>"How many copies of this magazine can you sell each issue?"</p>
<p>"Within ten copies; there are not many that can sell ten copies."</p>
<p>"Which magazine sells best?"</p>
<p>"Movies and the like!"</p>
<p>"Now that paper is so expensive, the prices of various magazines have almost doubled, and even fewer people are buying them. Therefore, most of the magazines on the shelves now have to be returned." He said with emotion, and with a very worried look.</p>
<p>"Then how much money can you earn every day?" I asked sympathetically.</p>
<p>"It's hard to maintain a living!" He was distressed.</p>
<p>"Then why do you sell newspapers?"</p>
<p>"There's nothing else to do!"</p>
<p>So I talked to him in detail. He told me that he was a student who had received junior high school education, in a county near Shanghai. His father was an official in a customs office, but since the war started, his family was gone, and his parents were nowhere to be found. He was lonely and drifted to the isolated island, living as a newspaper vendor. But he said that as long as there was a chance, he would leave here and would not want to sink his ambition.</p>
<p>In the end, I bought a magazine from him and slowly strolled home.</p>
<h3>Suggestion to Recall Altered Banknotes</h3>
<p>— Ding</p>
<p>During a busy business, a colleague of mine received an altered ten-yuan banknote. This banknote was altered from a five-yuan banknote issued by the Central Bank. If the four corners of the banknote were not blurred, it would be impossible to see the flaw. When the colleague took out the banknote to count it and found out, the buyer had long since disappeared. He was very angry and wanted to tear it up, but when he thought of how difficult it was to find money, he couldn't help but shed tears. He resentfully pressed the banknote under the glass plate as a reference for others to guard against. I have also seen altered banknotes several times. It is conceivable that many people must have been deceived, and some people then passed the altered banknotes on to others, which is a lack of morality. In my opinion, these banknotes should be handed over to charitable organizations, and the original face value of the altered banknotes should be recovered. Then, the charitable organizations can gather them together and exchange them at the respective banks. This method is without loss to both parties. Now, I borrow a corner of your newspaper for discussion by people from all walks of life.</p>
