<p>社評</p>
<h3>法國停戰的剖視與前瞻</h3>
<p>當寫着這篇評論的時候，來自世各處的電訉，傳說紛歧；總之。歐洲的形勢，憶陷入極端混　亂的狀態；歐洲的前途，憶蒞臨極端予盾的歧途。但是不容長此混亂長，此予盾。一切大約即在幾十小時之內，便可分曉，目前所確定的，祇有一點，就是在前天十七日，法國新任內閣總理貝當上將，確曾代表法國政府，對他的敵人，對他的國民，宣布了凖備停戰的意思。茲請即就這一點，試加分析。</p>
<p>如果貝當上將所宣佈的意思，終得演為事實，則德國元首希特勒各個擊破的戰略，又一次的收到了勝利。遠在戰爭爆發之前，各國乃至治國的觀察家早都看得很清楚，英·法聯軍方面有兩種最嚴重的弱點：第一，法國的人的資源，居於絕對的劣勢地位；第二，英·法在陸上作戰所負任務的不平衡，足以使雙方當局難於措置咸宜。這兩三年來，英法表面上和無間，幾乎有誼同一體之觀；但實際上雙方實有一個異常嚴重的問題，為雙方當局所深思熟慮同，苦心孤詣，圖謀得當而始終使這爭執未嘗暴露，便是英國實行徵兵制的問題；最後，雖在英國方面勉為其難了，但並未圓滿解決。隱然成為糾紛的泉源。在法國方面，如前任聯軍統帥甘茂林將軍，對於這一問題，重視尤甚。在英國方面，像艾登，霍爾，與貝立廈等眼光遠大的人士，在兩三年中，亦舌敝脣焦，不斷的呼籲，主張及早施行普遍的徵失；可是格於為許多頑固的力量，一直到　宣戰前夜，纔實了不澈底的徽兵制。及至戰禍臨實，英國儘其可能的派遣遠征破了，始法國方面雖等一再出以最友好的態度來稱頌他，但在實際上並不能適應法國的希望，更不足適應軍事的需求；因此一方面引起法國一部份人滋長了失敗主義的情緒，對戰爭前途懷抱悲觀；另一方面又使法國從事實與理智上體認艱危。體認英國的不可深恃。這是英法兩方咬緊了牙關所不願絲毫透露的煩悶，亦是同情於英法而深知其肉容者所不願從旁道破的內情：也就是德義宣傳機關所取為絕好資料，面多方運用的。</p>
<p>及至英法中樞相繼史張，即英國邱吉爾與法　萊諾相繼登臺組閣，一般都期望着法國對英國有如上述的隱痛與隔閡，可以不着痕跡的渙然冰釋，使兩國間的同盟關係，強化其心理的理智的基礎，庶幾未來的戰勝或戰敗，成為完全事合的共通運命。不料尤分誠熱情仍無補於尤分嚴重的事實；以邱吉爾與萊諾這兩位有卓識有魄力的後傑，終於挽救不了近乎先天的缺陷；使法國不得不背棄了必與英國共進退共休戚共和戰的信誓，而單獨聲明停戰。無論是法國的友人或敵人，在人性上宜無不為法國揮同情之涙吧！</p>
<p>戰爭必以國族的生死相搏，生死固置度外，勝敗卻非偶然；扼要言之，端在於敏捷抓住對方弱點：第一，他有兩面受亂的的危險，亦即他所最忌的在於東西兩戰塲同時作戰；第二，他有仰給國外的必要，亦即他所受不了的在於長期嚴密的被封鎖。英法方面知其弱點，想抓住，謀抓住，逐步逐步的實行其抓，獨失之於不敏捷；要是立刻抓住之於德波開戰的一霎那，即抓住於距今九個月之前，則今天會出現什麽局面，是誰也不敢說的。</p>
<p>英，法一再坐失了時機，自一切乃至一切，必經一種蹉跎，一種頓挫，然後自居於被動的地位，儘有所長，不及發揮。相反映的，德國卻抓住了自己的時機，抓住了對方的弱點，扣緊了法國致命傷，運用了獨擅勝塲的「閃電戰術」，傾舉國的力量，有如風發雲湧而速戰，幾如摧枯拉朽而決。使法國第一個人力缺乏的弱點，不容喘息餘地而完全暴露了出來，陷入難以挽救救的境地而義大利的突然參戰，至少更在精神上予法國以嚴重打擊。在這存亡續絕之交，英法兩國間，雖在主觀上居於共通運命、在客觀上卻絕不相同其甘苦與遭遇的程度，於是兩國間無法共通的第二個弱點炸了裂了。</p>
<p>來自世界各處的電訉，至記者執筆時為止，還是祗夠作回溯的說明，不夠作方來的推論。若論最近將來的趨響，將如何決定，則猶不出本報昨日所得出數關鍵；簡單重言之：一，德義條件為法國所不能認受而虞事復作；二，法國的海軍如何，成為法國取得和平否，英國繼續作戰否，亦即未來柏局戰局中的最重要因素；三，蘇聯西班牙土其以及美國的態度，直接或間接，潛在的或露骨的，必然為未來局勢中的大砝。</p>

<h3>歐戰巨變聲中　法屬越南的地位</h3>
<p>歐戰雖使法國耗費大宗財政軍國資源，但法國為保護越南安至而進行的朧大計劃，並未有所减削。</p>
<p>自一九三七年夏季以來，法國為地地富民繁的殖民地設防所費去的軍費，超過三，〇〇〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇法郎，此外，在一九三八年及一九三九年越南政府的預算中，又每年增加了四〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇越幣，以為國防之用。照越幣的普通價格，一越幣等於十法郎，那末在過去兩年中的軍費，又有八〇〇〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇法郎。</p>
<p>法國為某運在一隅的殖民地支出大量的軍費，理由在於恐懼日本對於這富饒的熱帶殖民地有所企圖。日本巳進佔了體西省的南寗，與法屬越南邊境相距只有二十二英里，而輿越南束城河內及北部海口海防相距只有一百六十五英里。</p>
<p>更使法人吃驚者，是日本業巳佔領海南島及西沙羣島是也。這兩軍事要點，輿其北部及東北部的加浪灣只有三百三十英里之遙，法國巳在該處設防，志在使其成為法國主要的海軍根據地。法國並巳在海防（距海南島西海岸不過一百二十五英里）西貢兩地建有小規模的海軍根據地，但這兩地沒有一處可達適於一萬二千噸軍艦出入的目的。</p>
<p>目前越南也許楚法國龐大殖民地最弱的一環，同時在東方有人認為，如果法國遇到外來攻擊，當可獲得新加坡軍港的海空軍的援助。</p>
<p>在去年六月，法國遠東的一切軍事將領會參與東方英殖民地及自治領軍事會議，該會議中會通過一議案，主張關於英法太平洋的領土防衛，相互聯絡。</p>
<p>自去年九月歐戰發生後，法屬越南政府通過了兩年新軍事特稅，希望每年增加一四，〇〇〇，〇〇〇越幣，那就是在一九一年，能獲得軍費二八〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇法郎。此外並增加郵費，產財權及文契登記費，及一切出口稅。若干項日財政費品，甚至有增稅達百分之五十者。</p>
<p>去年七月中，法殖民部長在對總統提出的一個報告中，會將越南新國防計劃，大致加以說明。他所稱述的幾項：有適當防禦軍員額的增加一倍，大量擴充空軍計劃，其中包括從荷蘭購入飛機五十架，及關於越南實業開發計劃，特別是使其成為獨立單位，不需要從法國本部輸入軍火，並發展飛機及馬達製造工業，及精密計劃設防加浪灣等。</p>
<p>在法殖民部長草成報吿時，法屬越南之空軍，只有六隊，但自此以後，即大量增加。法國一家飛機公司，叫做「諾姆—羅那」的，是正在建立一個工廠，將來可以每年產生一百五十架飛機及四百具馬達。</p>
<p>據法國殖民部長估計，在動員令下後一個月中，越南即可微調十萬訓練有業武裝齊備的土著兵上戰塲。這些士兵，將由安南人，東埔寨人，東京人，及其他土著人組成。安南人在上决大戰中，除開淸除戰塲及在後方做苦力工作以外，能力極小。</p>
<p>據法國軍官說除非每十個土著軍隊中，有一法國下級軍官，他們在開火後，才可避免潰散。</p>
<p>越南若干飛機塲已迅速增加，其增加的程度，決非由於民用航空的理由，並且還有好多新軍用公路加速完成。在本年初，越南業已有二萬一千英里的現代公路，其中三分之一是柏油公路。</p>
<p>法國不以為越南土著會有獨立運動發生。道與一九一四年至一九一八年的歐戰，有顯著的不同，那時越南人利用法人有事歐洲，企圖反法，結果產生高壓政策。</p>
<p>法國對於其遠東殖民地，比之英國，較易處置，英國印度的臣民，捲入歐戰中，公開不合作，提出獨立要求。越南人平靜無事地在法國人統治下的主要原因，是他們相信脫出了法國人的統治，必然招改了日本的統治。他們寗願受法屬而不願受日本的統治。</p>
<p>越南人目前對日的態度與幾年前有顯然的不同。以前法屬東京人奧安南人認為日本是東方民族從西歐帝國主義統治下解放出來的首領。</p>
<p>他們過去認為一個有善意的日本，可以賴以推翻法國的統治而成一獨立國家，日本勢力有一時期會極膨脹，日本間諜與土著革命勢力密切合作。</p>
<p>日本在中國的行動及造成熱帶亞洲殖民地野心的暴露，把這一切都改變了。越南人相信日本是對越南或其他亞洲國家，沒有善意的。</p>
<p>越南人震於日軍在中國的暴行，認為日本此次的侵犯，是征服行動。他們於是明白會同日本來驅逐法國，在一開始的時候，就將使日本獲得統治權。</p>
<p>在歐戰爆發後，法國人曾有不少疑懼。法國深恐土著起來叛亂，法國決定起用有軍權的武人統治越南。有自出思想和平手段白萊維調去，而加脫魯將軍則代之而任總督。法國盡量利用越南人力物力，以為歐洲作戰之用。</p>
<p>為與法國政府自足計劃步調一致，農業礦業原料生產之可作英法需要，或可輸出作換取外匯用者，皆生產加緊。新種茶區域也加擴充。牲畜。皮革。米。及橡膠都列於增加生產之項目上。</p>
<p>供英法工業之用的錫與鋅，也大量增加生產。鴻基公司之大量無烟煤也巳準備了大量數目，供給戰爭的需要。</p>
<p>土著軍隊的分遺隊—主要是為工兵及工程隊之用—業已被調赴法，而十餘萬的越南新部隊也在進行中。法國軍官宣稱：越南人大量願為自願兵業巳足敷需要。</p>
<p>對於一個浮面觀察者，歐戰對於越南影響似極少。物價稍形增加，因為進口貨物稀步，道一部分由於匯兌統制的結果。美國的香烟及英國的戚士忌酒很難獲得，海關及警察巡邏，更為嚴格，而著制服的人，更為觸目而已。在此以外，戰爭之徵象即不易見。尤其是離開各城市地帶，土著的生活，更無歐戰影響可尋了。（譯紐的泰語士報河內通訊）</p>
<h3>日本與歐戰　證據趨勢將隨　英德戰敗為轉移　目下採取機會主義　內心窺視東印越南</h3>
<p>歐戰發展至最高階段的時候，中國戰事消息在日不方面巳不大有人閱讀。日本人看到現在正是一種世界和一另種世界的生死鬥爭，他們感覺着很接近於這戰鬥塲所。他們儘可不參戰，但是歐戰結果如何，他們是不能不受影響的。這不但是他們將生活於何種世界的問題，並且也是他們前途會受何種影響的問題。</p>
<p>有一日本人吿訴記者，如果德國勝，日本也要變成像德國一樣。如果民主國勝，國社主義將無人過問，而日本也將從極端的右傾，回轉到中央地位。</p>
<p>日本與論，在形式上是守中立但在感情上是親德。報界對蘇聯侵略芬蘭，一致對芬同倩，但對於挪威，芬蘭，比利時却無絲毫同情。右派機關報，如報知新聞和國民新聞都希望德國騰利，然後根據國社主義產生一新紀元。</p>
<p>在日本人中，也有少數僑居國外的人，同情英法。日本獲利的商業中，每元美金中，有八角是與美國及英帝國交易而成，一般商人因都讚美英美。此外還有大部分的前輩敎育家及日本的基督敎徒，也屬於此類。</p>
<p>在另一極端是國社黨及法西斯黨的同情者，雖為數極少，但有實力。他們都是少壯派軍官及官僚。在民衆中間，凡加入愛國團體的靑年，都希望德國勝利。</p>
<p>日本外相有田在各帝團衝突中所循的外交途徑，全國都相信是一種正規。他認為未來世界，將成另一新型，不再是一個自由的個人主義文明，聽任各小國有法理及政治上的平等，同時並存。</p>
<p>這種新世界，將成為一廣大領域的結合，每一集團，都以一個强國為中心。美洲在美利堅合衆國之下，造成這樣一個集團，東亞必須置於日本覇權之下，而中歐則須由德國統制。蘇聯本身很大，巳足自成二單位。英法則認為尙足目存，雖其帝國不免要减小。</p>
<p>日本國策，在方法上是採取機會主義，在原朋上極為明白簡單。其目的是在使日本成為東亞盟主，這就是說，除開在華的「新秩序」，在西太平洋，造成門羅主義，而無外人殖民地在日本勢力範圍以內。</p>
<p>荷屬東印度自治很落後，如果荷蘭失去這些殖民地，日本就將以其保護人自居。小國據有這樣聲饒的殖民地極為日本所覲縣，日本的經濟侵略政策可以橫行無阻，並可待期而動。</p>
<p>日本對荷屬東印度最感切身利益的是煤油，橡膠，錫，這幾次戰事及工業必需品的安全供給。禁止荷蘭人利用自己生產來為本身防禦之用，那是有些過分。但荷蘭旣無路可循，很祇有迎合日本的意志，英法也同意。</p>
<p>所威為謎者，乃是蘇聯的態度。德國失敗之後，蘇聯是不是會集中力量對付得日呢？希特勒勝利之後，蘇聯會不會被拖入德德區域帝國以內，最後使日本感受比共產主義更大的危險呢？那些都是「或許」的問題。目下日本正在擴充陸軍，擴大設防帶，開始在滿洲做兵人伍，為未來不可知的形勢準備着。（譯紐的泰晤士報葉京通訊。）</p>

<h3>金融　外匯消息利空利多　經營者觀感不同</h3>
<p>外滙昨日市况、匯豐掛牌悉無上落、英美滙暗市、雖歐洲傳來之消息、足以影響市面、惟利多利空、經營者觀感不同、起伏範圍狹隘、初因法國對德停止抗戰、致美英間互匯再猛跌四分半、晨間英鬆美平、投機家首拋美滙、滙豐與日銀行先後收吸、進口商活動扒結、十點三十分最較英金三辦士九〇六二五、及美金五元九〇六二五、麥加利與某美行忽來售出、華銀行行亦拋、且劇某個人私電、英法將重啟組織聯合抗德政府、英鎊與法郎全由美國維持傳說、市况遂見步硬、下午港電與華行稍售、而美銀行與沙與均進、且今日美英匯兌續看小、致美金獨緊終為三辦士九三七五及五元九〇六二五、英長〇一五六二五、美緊〇九三七五、交易頗任、</p>

<p>香港美匯接連緊</p>
<p>香港十八日（週三）電、今晨滙市聞盤平定、美這則劇邊帶平、英滙現期貨均告不動、美匯現貨緊一二五、為二十二元六八七五、（昨收為二十二元八一二五）、申匯現貨降四元、為二百七十四元、（昨收為三百七十八元）、日滙現貨緊半元、為九十六元、十時十分、美匯現貨續緊、六二五、為二十二元六二五、十一時三十分平定、惟美匯吿軟、英匯日匯不動、美匯現貨續緊一二五、為二十二元半、申匯現貨升五元、為三百七十九元、午收美滙仍吿軟縮、美匯現貨再聚〇六二五、為二十二元四三七五、申滙現貨回升二元、為三百七十七元、下午二時三十分開盤吿平、各匯概無變動、</p>

<h3>歐洲消息分歧　金市無多大刺激　買賣官網曲折不一</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤、不脫徘徊之局、歐洲變動、經營者不受絲毫刺激、目前並無影響、有待今後之發展、全日買賣尙稱熱烈、惟起伏雖甚曲折、為數未現龐大、晨開為五千百八十元、經某金號力吸、及錢兌業收購下、漲達五千六百四十元、嗣以證券帮現金號散戶反掀賣風、一度回落至五千五白四十元、嗣錢兌業某金號銀號等復乘賤撈入、時外匯雜緊、致價又升達五千六百七十元、午收重跌一百元、後市初疲、銀號帮出售最多、惟聞外匯仍微見緊、買戶俱現興奮、將價抬達五千六百二十五元、收市尙為五千五百九十元、較隔昨晚收軋漲十五元、全日成交的三千餘兩、銀樓飾初掛高、終平、海關金等仍平、</p>
<p>烚赤軋升十五元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初以匯市吿平、開市略抬五元、錢兌業進銀號十兩、為五千五百八十元、繼因金號銀號兩帮拋出、而某錢兌業巳乏吃胃、跌落二十元、金號出證券帮十兩、遜為五千五百六十元、旋外匯吿緊、買風陡起、金號錢兌業及銀號等爭先扒吸、不久遂飛漲八十元、銀號互做二十兩、為五千六百四十元、後以買者减少、證券幫等突來吐售、現金號亦接踵賣出、未幾猛撳白元、證券帮出錢兌業十兩、退為五千五百四十元、嗣因外匯依然走軟、且散戶賣風巳息、加之不久金號曁銀號帮競同收吸、價遂復見飛躍一百三十元、證券帮出銀號三十兩、為五千六百七十元、午刻買者轉少、而滙市斯時亦忽報回硬、致引起散多吐出、遂四入五千六百元關內、證券帮出金號二十兩、為五千五百七十元作午收價、午後開時銀號帮互相競賣、開市即撳五元、銀號互做十兩為五千五百六十五元、嗣因買者極少再跌二十五元、某銀號出證券帮五十兩、為五千五百四十元、旋因賣者漸减、散戶乘低撈入、市勢頓轉、回升三四十元、後再加某銀號力進二百餘兩、價遂銜出五千六百元關外銀號帮對做三十兩、為五千六百二十五元、入後某銀號止扒觀望、而某錢兌業傾向吐出、價遂不支回降、銀號互做二十兩、為五千五百九十元、作晚收價、結果比上日軋升十五元、全天一百三十元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤高十餘元、收進减低三十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十餘元、均鮮做開、</p>
<p>首飾金欲高又止</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、初時大同行仍懸五百七十兩、迨十時掛大十元、午刻回落十元、此後無變化、結果半平、大同行依舊懸五百七十元、新同行與上價相同、收進减低三十元光景、</p>
<h3>外幣盤旋之局</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市况、炲赤漸呈盤勢、英美金鎊因亦起伏靡定、卒吿微漲一元、英余票供求仍均勻、市價站平、美金票始則父會高至十七元、入後步退至十六元六角半、卒為十六元八角、比上日戰漲二角、香港票供給較旺、市價略軟、安南票需求漸殷、市價挺漲、日金票不乏供給、晚市退為一元零八分、朝鮮票稍有需要、市價略漲、晚市為九角四分半、</p>
<h3>南京銀行停業</h3>
<p>本市南京商業儲蓄銀行不穩、市面早有傳說、昨日該行巳關門、銀行業聯合準備委員會即於上午九時三十分通函各交換銀行略云、南京銀行十七日交換存款餘額、不敷抵付應付差額、至今尙未補足、依照章程撤銷十七日之該行交換關係、所有關於該行應收應付票據、應互相返還、並自即日起、暫行停止辦理交換關係云、</p>
<h3>世界銀價傾跌</h3>
<p>十七日倫敦電大條銀市、近期因大衆售出、致猛跌四三七五、遠月供給有限、致小一二五、買戶尤稀、少交易、市况平，收市後、市仍平、又紐的電、美銀價現貨小二五、至印銀突見在跌三羅比三安那、均退至五十九羅比十二安那、市况軟疲、成交單共二百張云、</p>
<h3>證劵　內債漲風波動　外股大都搶帽子</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、自經兩日趨跌之後復又轉漲、市塲人心、以為歐戰之解決、或將運帶及於中日之和平、作此理想之揣測、實未明我國抗戰眞諦、有類夢想、其實市價回高、為宜昌之失而復得、戰事又吿順利之故、行市雖未必遽行高翔、但亦不易跌落、昨日趨努、以順泰及二十號兩家最多、餘則十一號及聯益補空、但午後聯益又復賣出、全日以鴻康賣出為最多、益昌久豐及四號均有出脫、前途時局如無鉅大變動、僓市當不致發生變化、昨日市價結界回好二角半至四角半、成交總數的計六十餘萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交交通銀行股六十股、價為六十五元、</p>
<p>衆業公所昨日股市、値得注意者為怡和股、星期一開盤時蓋紙三十元、而昨最高價會達三十九元二五、最後為三十瓦元、英聯股上落亦極在勃、橡皮股雖各公司之獲利展望甚佳（大槪自自分之三十以至五十）、而價格之反應仍徵關於星期一二兩日所有之龐大交易中、不知有若于分為眞正投資交易、而若干分為「搶帽子」買賣、</p>
<p>倫敦十七日（週十）電、今日中國外僓掛牌行市、仍吿平穩、上下檔各債券概無變動、</p>
<p>倫敦十七日（週一）電、今日英商遠東各公司股票掛牌行市、仍會平穩、祗古拉客林傍橡皮股跌落七便士半、價為十五先令、有行無市、其餘不動、</p>
<h3>糧食　米價轟動過高之後　昨日已回小一二元不等</h3>
<p>邇來米市恒多變化、起伏之巨、往往出人意囊、而此次漲風、尤屬劇烈、粳米暗盤竟及七十元、洋米價會達六十元大關、在半月中、突升十數元、是誠有史以來所未有、昨晨開市、不獨去路旣滯、多所袖手、且賣方似感無從脫手之苦、實由於價格一轟太高與內地米價走平、搬運已於國利、同時又與洋米布價接近、定貨甚巨、途貨不日大批湧釗、而默戰又將結束、一般投機家謠諑不攻而破、失所憑藉、浙省甬紹等帮、有直接訂購洋米之舉、有此種種關係、亟亟求脫、大勢巳去、人心難挽、恁你喊破喉嚨、儘多充耳不聞、一路直下、末稍轉機、洋米牧盤行情、一號四貢為五十六元半、火紋五十六元、小絞五十四元、東京陽尖五十四元半至五十四元、混合碎五十元四十八九元、米茶五十一元、統計各價較之前日上午牧價、猛瀉二元左右、午後初以越南問題會一度回振、但終以實銷淸淡、浮戶續脫、市價起而復落、結果又此午收續小二三角、新交易未妥、蓋市上謠言不絕、或恐被阻、致未訂購、回籠貨亦較小一元、二號西貢六月下七月初初開六十二元半、後至六十三元、又二號邏米六十二元半、共成交二百多噸、現洋米則不足六千包、</p>
<p>到滬洋米、昨日又有大批、係怡和洋行怕生輪自香港運來、共計二萬零七百五十二包、停靠法租界羅斯福碼頭起卸、聞今日有三千包運往福建、</p>
<p>厚薄粳等爾米、到貨雖仍有限、祇千餘包、但傳聞俗外晴盤、因某方見滬米昂貴、大利所在、頗思染指、故有在產地搜刮大宗運滬之說、閘價相隨銳跌二元、常帮特淸粳六十六七元，蘇崑常州白粳六十五六元、青泗特薄六十六元、南港率稻高自六十四元半、次至六十二元半、</p>
<h3>麵粉動銷南洋</h3>
<p>麫粉昨日二號紛廠盤、無變動、因遍來米價昂騰、紛之需要有增無减、客銷方面、南洋幫新交易亦稱聯蟬、如天竹等牌客盤須十六元二角半、惟回籠貨以競爭關係、稍有參差、統市成交各粉併計的二萬餘包、老車牌回籠貨及內地雜牌粉供求兩寂、槪無正市、小麥亦無正式市面、今日有麺粉三萬五千包運隔建、一千五百包運香港、</p>
<p>此外豆子一千零十包、運香港、一百五十包運新加坡、豆餅四千塊運福建、二千九百十塊運香港、芝蔴二百包運香港、</p>
<h3>紗花　傳言利空　棉紗下降</h3>
<p>紗市趨疲、且跌風又起、此因法單對德不令停戰、有和平之說、於是人心又轉疲弱之逾、同時海外棉市亦向下風、所以賣氣略濃、市盤又復下降、不過華南一帶、對於十支粗紗採辦依然紛至沓來、情况獲益匪淺也、</p>
<p>現紗晨開、因上日人氣緊昂、多方喊價殊高、開價二十支雙馬一千二百元、做過十包、其中恐有不妥之處、一雙間為一千一百七十五元、直跌至一千一百四十元、旋聞外滙鬆後復緊、又到一千一百六十五元、但大戶仍無收進之意、市態又向下降、且傳言紛紛、大都利於空方、收盤價為一千一百四十六元、查半日閒成交統計一千七百六十三包、行情二十支雙馬跌二十三元、今日有紗五百二十五件運香港、一千二百八十五件運廣州灣、九十件運海門、四十件運海防、茲將各幫口買去之額量列左、</p>
<h3>美印棉回跌　本棉交易寂靜</h3>
<p>本棉交易沉靜如恒、此因紗市無新發展、據云美棉又復下落二十餘磅音、印棉亦乏生氣、所以廠方納胃殊滯、市象無大興奮之狀、不過偶有生意、皆係印棉行情頗形疲弱云、</p>
<p>另訊外棉市價、紐的棉市、晨初開盤先因投機者之賣出而跌、後因法國消息傳來、及一部份多頭了結、結果收盤價格、較之上日跌二十磅音、印度棉市昨日連同預測跌四羅比</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、日來漸見起色、然成交數不巨、同業心患頗為堅定、大衆之意見、俱認棉價巳漸見轉機矣、</p>
<h3>疋頭　遊擊區布銷增</h3>
<p>布市跌後回堅、乃因布價看種、同業及容戶漸落手購辦、實際去化、亦形增加、富實細斜·振中細布等貨較上日每疋面挺二角半至五角、餘貨市盤穩定、祗夏令布疋走銷呆滯、售盤較挫、近來游擊區杭州·黨湖·定海等地需要突增、聞大部份係輾轉深入內地、昨本街成交白貨漂染各布二百餘件、浙皖帮辦粗布·色布近百件、北路烟津帮辦色布·綫呢·印花一百四五十件、香港帮辦紐斜·粗布五六十包、</p>
<p>東布最漲午回、龍頭細布高看見過三十五元五角終以實銷平庸、仍復下挫、後市降至卅四元九角、本街及北帮辦現期貨細布的四五百件、</p>
<p>疋頭十九日運天津一百七十件、運廣州灣二百七十二件、這海防九十一件、這海口八十件、運新加坡十五件、</p>
<h3>孝克司根到銷旺　每套西裝一百五十元</h3>
<p>孝克司根、自二十七年份盛行以來、今庚夏銷更見風行、定到亦絞其他呢羢為夥、一般拆貨帮大半齊有出樣、大路帮亦多有到銷、大路帮多係穴·七·八元一碼之東貨、拆貨帮多為二十餘元一碼之美國貨、美國貨質佳價昂、洋服帮齊待主客指定後購剪之、東貨價廉、普通生意較盛、顏色有純白·淡黃·深黃·靑灰·淡豆沙色等等、實銷以黃灰及白色最為暢盛、是項衣料、寬祗四十餘寸、故售二十餘元之孝克司根、西裝每套大半非法幣一百五十元不可、</p>
<h3>糖市　粗車白續鬆</h3>
<p>昨糖市因散囤戶售出過多、續見下游、公會劃盤、現貨二四粗白本棧七十元三角、至七十元、外棧七十元至六十九元八角、小七角、轉口貨上午五十五元六角至四角、下午五十五元二角至五十五元、小一元、太古車白B嘜新貨八十一元半、小五角、H嘜車赤五十八元、荷赤仍五十九元六角、本廠雪白七十元半、一號冰九十一元半、晶明冰九十三元、劉糖僅開出刁青五六十包（太古輸到）仍六十三元半、此外與化糖叫價過高、絕無成交、</p>
<h3>絲茶　內地運輸受阻　絲價上升</h3>
<p>昨日絲市、國外無甚榮辱、紐的近期漲半分、遠期跌三分、橫濱現貨小二十元、這期小十六元、本埠絲市因內地暫時不能運滬、絲價刺激上升、仁記等行因有補貨交易、故白廠現貨討價巳漲至五千二百元、但本埠現貨有限、致甚靈成交、市况頓形堅淸云、</p>
<h3>南北貨　府紅突漲九元</h3>
<p>府紅棗近以軋缺、市勢突緊、查前市開過二十六元、昨開數十包、竟達三十六元現鈔、漲起九元之多、可見緊俏一斑、</p>
<h3>五金　水泥行盤堅定</h3>
<p>邇來流通於市上之水泥現貨、頗感軋缺、雖本街建築幫所採、並不見多、而水泥仍有求過於供之感、原因實係水泥來源受阻、且又屬軍用上之必須品、運滬因難、業此貨者、心思昂堅、不願廉售、故刻市行盤仍堅、若白水泥每桶售一百〇五元、馬頭五十五元、袋頭貨每袋喊十六元、均比前市之黃金時代、無相上落耳、</p>
<h3>雜項　溫州箱板土紙有到</h3>
<p>衛生用紙、自富陽糙（毛）紙來源不暢後、早由溫州四六屏紙起而替代、行銷市上、範圍頗廣、此紙反祗供北方各地造紙錢之用、今則多此一筆生意、昨由溫州運來七千件、箱板亦以溫州為多、會因來源中阻、故嘗飛漲、昨亦由溫州運來七千件、（組）</p>

<h3>法國停戰　不影響上海局勢　謠諑孔多均無事實證明　法總領歐仁作堅定表示</h3>
<p>上海租界地位、因具錯綜復雜之國際關係、故每一國際局勢之變易、輒受其不可避免之影響與波動、於是杯弓蛇影、謠諑繁興、但實際情形、則往往並不如此、惟自昨日法國停戰之消息　滬後、不免又震動世人耳目、其實外傳種種、均屬無根讕言、不足置信、歐局究將如何演變、一時尙難斷言、至於遠東方面、日方野心之因歐局突變而趨熾烈、固屬事實、但南太平洋方面、國際關係、異常復雜、日方未必竟至不顧一切操切從事、至關於上海租界、則目前決不致發生何等變動、茲分述各情如次、</p>
<p>日兵演習　無足驚異</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、法國對德投降消息傳來後、昨（十七日）夜及今（十八日）晨、南市有日憲兵及坦克車舉行演習、且謠傳汪派士兵三千名已抵上海、致本市外僑及華人商界、皆有不安之感、眾業公所今日呈奇特之反響、市場開盤堅挺、稍見上昇、一度回跌、而後續漲、眾信此乃受汪政權將在數日內發行新貨幣一說之影響所致、</p>
<p>法總領事　嚴正表示</p>
<p>法總領事歐仁今晨吿記者稱、上海法租界目下地位、當予賡續維持、關於今晨所傳數種謠諑、歐仁斥為無稽之談、謂「目下我人一息猶存、必須工作、我人并不悲傷、法租界一切事務、連同警務在內、皆照常態賡續進行如前、流言沸揚、聽之可耳、我人決不為之所動、我人今仍站於土地上、而非長眠土中云、</p>
<p>外傳種種　未能證實</p>
<p>關於日憲兵及坦克車在南市演習事、今日未獲說明、曾有數人、目擊演習、本市當局則未能予以解釋、惟信此項演習、與前在虹口舉行者相同、今為若干特殊而移南市舉行、汪方士兵三千名抵滬、糾集本市四週說、未能完全證實、</p>
<p>美陸戰隊　返抵上海</p>
<p>又駐滬美第四海軍陸戰隊士兵二百名、在秦皇島訓練完畢、昨乘美艦貝柯斯號返抵上海、聞若輩係意國宣佈參戰後、奉令返滬者、俾加強駐滬美軍實力、</p>
<p>日發言人　所作表示</p>
<p>本埠日本駐華大使館發言人對西報記者稱、法國對德軍屈服一事、并不引起日當局對本埠局勢採取激劇之改變、日本採取不介入歐戰之政策、亦不思控制英法兩租界、除非兩租界有「擾亂和平」或「妨碍日本建設東亞新秩序之計劃」、日本以前曾向兩租界提出頗多要求、其中若干、迄未達到、但目下兩租界當局與日軍官員間之關係、頗為友好、關於租界內駐有交戰國軍隊一層、該發言人稱、傅「市長」要求該項軍隊撤退之意見、照國際公法、甚為合理、且此項軍隊之存在、頗能引起「非故意之事件」、而迫使日本不得不採取行動以維持「和平」與「秩序」、又稱、日當局對於本埠中英文各種報紙、非常注意、其中若干報紙、日當局對之甚為不滿、而在密切注意中、該發言人又稱、日本正從事於大規模之戰爭、日人之天然願望、必須獲得滿足、外國人反對日本之行動者、蓋不明事實耳、但日本不欲乘歐洲變動之機會、而獲得　　外人在華之利益、日本人之口號為「不介入歐戰」、日人相信歐洲為歐洲人的、美洲為美洲人的、而東方則為東方人的、該發言人末稱、法國屈服一事、日人并不視為驚異、蓋彼等早已逆料有此一日、德軍所用武器、日人均知之、因日對此有密切接觸也、</p>
<p>滬西一帶　情形安謐</p>
<p>昨日又有謠傳謂、日本憲兵加入附近法租界四圍越界築路區內之「大道警局」、以增強其實力、記者昨午於越界築路區巡行一周、證明該項謠傳并不真確、日憲兵僅在「上海市政府」內可見若干、記者巡行時、祇在海格路見一日軍官率領「大道警察」數名沿路巡邏、此外并無所見、</p>
<p>金融市場　尙稱穩定</p>
<p>昨日市場方面、因謠諑極多、雖不免感受刺激、然大體亦尙稱穩定、良以投機家亦均出諸審慎、未敢操切、昨晨英磅價格、雖一度因歐局消息、頗見下降、旋因供給有限、且日方銀行收進、即回升甚多、計英磅開盤三元六〇、收盤三元六五、惟法佛郎自上星期五實際上停止交易後、至昨日已完全停頓、匯市匯豐掛牌不動、黑市英鬆美緊、此外標金·紗花·雜糧等市場、進出均少、殊見安定、</p>
<h3>形格勢禁無法南進</h3>
<p>歐戰形勢急轉直下後、太平洋風雲突形緊張、據傳日本駐華艦隊總懷念島田中將最近赴海南島視察、前日曾檢閱駐紮灒島北部之部隊及前綫戰事情形、實則另有特殊任務、與日本南進政策、有聯帶關係、不久以前、東京人士觀察、敬法國停戰、則日本對於法屬印度支那之政策、更趨積極、</p>
<p>嚴重注意　日本行動</p>
<p>據英國當地外交界某要員觀測、日本確有此企圖、但因顧忌美國態度堅決、故猶豫不前、衕時美國觀察家發表所說、美國當局對於維持太平洋現狀之極為堅決、如將艦隊永遠集中檀香山及不擬參加歐戰等措施、可為明證、美國當局正在嚴密注視日本行動、日本如在南太平洋有舉動時、美國將不特以經濟制裁迫日本就範、抑且以其龐大之空軍威力、足以粉碎島國而有餘、</p>
<p>美國空軍　威力驚人</p>
<p>據最近統計、美國戰鬥機綫數有八千五百架之多、航空根據地滿佈由北極至熱帶各處、即以民間航空機師而論、一年內已增至一萬人、同時具有「飛行堡壘」三十九架、一九四一年六月間、將有一七五架、數目雖少、但世界各國無一能與美國周旋、此種「飛行堡壘」、能往返飛行三千二百英哩、美國駐檀香山空軍、能飛往東京、轟炸及逕返根據地、或由大西洋根據地飛往德國薩爾布力根空襲、殊無困難之處、美國空軍之威力、於此可見、</p>
<h3>請各業協助　紹屬災賑　各業公會建議　甬紹捐賑統一</h3>
<p>自寗紹兩衕鄉會分別組織勸募委員會後、即開始募款採購巨量洋米運往接濟、各業公會亦動員募款、救濟寗紹兩屬災荒、茲據新聲社記者探悉、今各業公會鑒於寗紹兩衕鄉會個別募款、為力較微、若連合進行、收效較巨、已建議該兩同鄉會統一辦理、并普遍撥款救濟、</p>
<p>擴大募捐</p>
<p>紹屬七縣旅滬同鄉會為擴大募捐起見、昨特分發本市各衕業公會函件、以米荒嚴重、每石漲至一百二十元、糠麸食盡、繼嚐草根樹皮、孩童被棄、餓殍載道、加以天氣亢旱、未種農田尙半數、預計秋收、定多遜色、特發起擴大勸募紹屬平糶捐運動、協助各縣平糶團體之進行、謀整個紹屬米糧之救濟、乞憐念吾紹數百萬待哺飢民、廣泛呼籲、勸募鉅捐、俾奄奄垂斃者、得慶更生、又該會現決定一俟募捐款項集有成數後、將視何處最迫切待濟者、先行採購米糧辦理平糶、盼各同鄉會踴躍輸捐、</p>
<p>開會協議</p>
<p>寗波旅滬同鄉會因桑梓米荒發起勸募以來、各業衕鄉、咸踴躍輸將、而尤以五金業衕鄉輸捐最多、為數達八萬餘元、其他各業、亦甚具熱心、自發動勸募工作後、常能超過預定之數目、該會為商討各項救濟工作起見、定於本月二十二日召集全體大會、業於昨日發出通知書與各衕業公會、</p>
<p>災情續報</p>
<p>寗波旅滬同鄉會昨接鄞縣東錢湖一帶各鄉長函報、略謂、鄞東錢湖一帶居民、向以捕魚為業、近今湖水乾涸、漁船擱置湖中、不能開船落洋、束手無策、在此米荒嚴重之際、餓斃者日有所聞、請速救濟、又鄞縣鄞江橋地方、山地無水、不產糧食、向種貝母、自米荒以來、糧食不能接濟、近已斷糧旬日、居民啼飢號渴、沿途餓殍橫陳、慘不忍視、近亦紛紛請求該會設法救濟、</p>
<h3>寄歐信件　退回數批　投遞地點發生戰事　赴歐郵輪定期出口</h3>
<p>據郵政總局方面消息、自歐洲發生戰事以還、本埠寄往歐洲各國之郵件、頗多因投遞地點發生戰事、而無法送達者、現已有數批退回來滬、其中無法投遞地區、以荷蘭挪威比利時及德國等地為多、種類則以信件為大宗、</p>
<p>據平明社記者訪悉、本月中本埠出口赴歐之各國輪船、二十日後有大英公司之梯拉華號、廿四日後皇家公司之寳樹雲號、廿七日美國柯立芝總統號、月底有法郵船佛力士羅素號等、</p>
<h3>取締米糧攙雜　昨日囤戶拋售米價下跌</h3>
<p>際斯米價飛漲聲中、一般無恥米蠢、竟在上等食米中、攙雜次貨出售、欺矇市民、將商業道德置之途外、雖經當局疊次佈告、嚴加取締、一時收效頗宏、時至今日、米價愈趨高峯、民食恐慌未除、而一般投機米商、竟復異想天開、米糧攙雜復熾、茲當局已具決心正、在嚴密注意中、一經查出屬實、決將從嚴懲處、以儆其餘、而資取締、昨日米市、因投機者連日妄拾價格、每石米價、高達六十元、致買戶裹足、而一般囤戶、咸以有利可圖、乃競起拋售、且本市米糧來源、除連日有大批西貢洋米到滬外、京滬鐵路亦日有數千石國米運來、近郊農民又復肩挑車載、運入本市售賣、每日為數亦達三千石左右、昨日洋米國米、均下跌元許、惟一般投機者、仍圖蠢動</p>
<h3>土地局檔案圖冊　領團拒絕移交　應歸還於合法之中政府　傅筱庵以宣佈無效恫嚇</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報云、今（十八日）晨聞諸可靠方面、上海領事團對於上海市府土地局檔案圖冊三百十二箱交還「市長」傅筱庵事、意見分歧、數國駐滬領事反對將檔案等交出、因彼等相信時機</p>
<p>尙未成熟也、據其領署官員稱、傅氏仍須表示其願與公共租界當局合作之誠意、如關於界外馬路問題之協定、尙未達初步解決、即成立西區聯合警察隊是也、至於目下保管檔案之公共租界工部局、尙未正式接獲各國領事間</p>
<p>意見分歧通知、查工部局對於此事、本年初曾向領事署請示應取行動、當有數領事令工部局保存檔案、以待更有利之時間、惟領事署以全體名義、則通知工部局謂、局方當初</p>
<p>接管檔案時、并未商諸領事團、故局方須自行解決此事、傅筱庵曾向新聞記者稱、除工部局決定移交檔案所必要之時期外、渠不願久待、茍不在短期交出、渠或將宣佈此　檔案圖冊無效、而租界以外各區之界石</p>
<p>或將拆除云、關於界外馬路談判、傅氏謂今已輪及渠對工部局警務處長包文少校三週前提出之建議、予以最後答復、惟工部局對檔案之態度、足見局方并非極顯界外馬路問題、獲得解決、</p>

<h3>愛麥虞限路　路名似擬取消　目前已成為「無名之路」　將來命名有待當局決定</h3>
<p>據法文上海日報云、前星期五（十四日）法租界愛麥虞限路之路牌、忽被人於深夜除去、現該路已成為無名之路、依法國習慣、凡路之以人名者、大半對於此人、無論其存亡、以酬其對法服務之功、表示崇敬之意、此次義大利對法宣戰、而法租界尙有其國王之路名、殊足觸人耳目、故自以除去之為佳、至於此無名之路、將來當有若回定名、則為市政機關之</p>
<p>路名更易不乏前例</p>
<p>查在一九一四年歐戰時、法租界亦有一路、名日責隆路、藍以紀念德國之著名醫生、在戰事爆發後、該路之路牌、忽在一夜被人取去、而私改其路名為霞飛路、迨後則資隆路改名為亞爾培路、而寶昌路則改名為霞飛路、至于擯除寶隆路路牌之人、不久返國參戰陣亡、而法租界當局、為紀念起見、乃以其人之名字為路名、蓋即今之汶林路也、</p>
<h3>日社團要求工部局　文件中用日文</h3>
<p>據昨日日方消息、本埠日本社團、現正要求工部局對於一切正式文件、需英文與日文並用、此項要求、將由工部局日籍董事問局方提掛、日入不久並將組織日人納稅會、與工部局直接談判此事、</p>
<h3>南京商業儲蓄銀行　突然停業　範圍狹隘不生影響　小錢莊亦有倒閉者</h3>
<p>九江路四川路轉角之南京商業儲警銀行上海分行、設立以來、為時將近一年、昨晨不知因何事故、突然停止辦公、將大鬥緊閉致往提款項者、無法獲得、祇見該行門上、貼有雜師通吿一則、略謂、「本行上海分行副經理及各部至任、於本日（六月十八日）辦公時間、均未到行、致庫門鎖閉、無人開啟、營業事務、無人負責、以致營業停頓、除電呈董事會及總經理請示辦法外、特請律師通吿本行上海分行經副理及各部主任、即日到行點交帳冊證件重要單據、及會同奚玉書會計師淸算帳目」、等語、一般存戶、因該行突然停止營業、致無法提款、均大起恐慌、</p>
<p>最近兩週來、黃金價格、漲落甚巨、投機黃金、多吿折閱、據大光社記者向該業方面探悉、銀號小錢莊倒閉的計巳有十家之多、多屬新興開設、尙未加入錢兌公會、惟對倒閉諱莫如深、多嚴守秘密、不願向外界宣佈、聞此次虧累倒閉、最多者亦僅一二萬元、至六七萬元不等、</p>
<h3>挪威駐滬總領　矢志效忠挪王　痛斥傀儡政府葵士林　挪領判權絕未遭威脅</h3>
<p>字林西報云、挪威我辦兼駐英總領事克組崇、昨日（十七日）申明堅決効忠挪威國王及在倫敦之挪政府、並斥葵士林為最卑賤之挪威人、據克氏吿記者稱、德軍侵入挪威後、派葵士林組織壽命短促之</p>
<p>傀儡政府</p>
<p>其時渠曾接葵士林政府來電、令渠服從命令、惟渠對此電文、置之不答、蓋德方所派任何人在挪威成立政權、僅係傀儡、而未得挪王之准許也、渠接此電後、小數日葵士林政府即</p>
<p>停止活動</p>
<p>挪人現決聽令於唯一有資格的挪威政府、一如往昔、該政府刻與挪王及王儲、同在倫敦、當初挪威瞬將遭遇侵略時、此間挪僑事務繁忙、而德軍佔據挪威後、挪僑</p>
<p>頗為焦慮</p>
<p>殷切以待歐洲及祖國來訊、渠會處理須加注意之許多複雜問題、尤其是此間娜商航業事件、工作頗為辛勞、今挪船仍懸挪旗、但已停止駛往挪戚口岸、渠接獲刻在倫敦之挪威航業委員會發來命令而遵行之、溯自歐洲烽火陡起以還、挪威在華領判權、</p>
<p>未遭威脅</p>
<p>外傳某方施加壓力、迫挪人放棄其在華領判權之說、寶屬不確、自挪威被捲入戰渦以還、本市挪領署人員、工作如常、處理其轄下之若干案件、克氏結尾、表示其挪威終可獲得公道的莫不搖動之信公、謂挪威唯一合法政府、今偕挪王及王儲同在倫敦、</p>

<h3>捐苛稅雜來源稀少　豬肉不敷應用</h3>
<p>滬上豬肉、因來源稀少、售價日見堅俏、據肉商云、目下南通方面如新港·秦港·等、凡豬船經過河道、須俟某方海軍勒徵所謂捐款」、方肯發給通行證、乃可通行、因此一般豬商、以水陸重重剝削、幾無利刻圖、裹足不出、此乃一大原因、故一週以來、平均每日抵滬豬隻、僅千五百頭左有、而兩租界能有三千頭到埠、方能應付裕如、</p>

<h3>闈中開河</h3>
<p>浙闈之水，皆取給於西湖，離貢院甚遠，故挑水者病之一塲旣畢，開門放水，而塲外之地皆濕不能行，以前並塲內亦濕，嗣立水筧，以通外水，盤腸內注，制作一新，亦可為斟酌盡善者矣。今梅中丞又曲體人情，欲於闈中開河，通東西兩橋之水於大門之內。惟浙闈近年以來，槍替之弊百出，而外槍均由水管遞入，蓋水管由外注內，茍得一人在水管之旁守候，見有油紙包流入，即行取起，然後按其字號，分往傳交，人孰從而知之。其題紙之出也，則明遠　上大書題目，闈外人以望遠鏡測之，　毫不爽焉。題目則遠樓以出，文章則由水管以入，此弊蓋歷科皆有之，由是以觀，則通外河於闈中，其傳遞不更捷於水管乎。或者謂外河之通在於大門之內，儀門之外，仍不可以通於號中，無容過為遠慮，然水管之設，何以達之於內也。或又謂河邊多置巡綽之官，不時巡察，則此弊可以凈絕，然巡綽官誰肯認真危坐其間乎。</p>

<h3>關於增加學費</h3>
<p>— 新良</p>
<p>在上禮拜六下午，我看到了弟弟從學校里帶來的一張通吿，里面印有許多應在學期結束時注意的事件，其中之一就是校中因邇來物價高漲，支出浩大，所以自下學期起增加學費三元，藉謀挹注。</p>
<p>在星期日上，接着又看到了奚玉書氏對於滬校增加學費問題所發表的談話。其中有云：「……要知敎員生活不能維持，則將無願爲敎員之人矣；無敎員即無敎育，則子弟之敎育難矣。故增加學費，使敎員得合理之生活，即子弟可得合理之敎育，事屬至公……」</p>
<p>的確，我們都知道：目前當小學敎員的人是太苦了。敎員的生活不安定，他們是決不會安心於敎育的。他們每天旣得在柴米房租上用心思，試問那里尙有精神可依賴用於教導上呢？所以，增加學費，使敎員能够度一種合理的生活，間接子弟們也可得到一種較合理之敎育，的確是應該毫無疑義的。</p>
<p>我但願；每僩學校，歷來因有盈餘而不預備在下學期起增加學費的，常然最好，如果不得不增加的，那末，就應該像奚玉書先生所說的：爲提高敎員薪給，而決不是籍增費之名，圖個人享受與利益。</p>
<h3>活</h3>
<p>— 雲</p>
<p>扯破了喉嚨沒命價喊上一整天，拖着微腫的兩條腿跑回家裏，最親愛的唯有一襲破絮的眼床。可是倒下去把筋骨鬆活了一下，就得將帶回的九十本算術習題批改好，眞可說連晚飯也難以安適下嚥。唉！做敎員嗎！簡直比管理九十架機器還着力，我的天！</p>
<p>黃昏了，洗衣服，補襪子，能够放心睡下，時鐘總不肯同情我的忙碌稍等一刻而亂打十一點了。白天假如不是姊姊答應了代我管住兩個小孩，只怕連這十元錢的差使也休想哩</p>
<p>眼看時針跳過了十二點鐘，、好容易費盡心計哄得四歲的馨剛剛睡熟，但，熄滅了亮還不到五分鐘，脚跟和肩頭上漸漸癢起來了，忍一會吧！只怕又要驚醒了小孩，反正每一角的孤島上，都有着道可惡的夜盜，晚上極應該練就沉著的鎭靜態度，白天才採用閃電戰術來肅淸牠的巢穴。所以老是小願發狠起來追擊這輩厭物，免得提起了精神又害失眠。可是僅剩的幾片餅乾，耗子正恨着咬不破鐵罐而動怒了，不知怎的被他們翻倒在地上滾呀拋呀，來得出勁。他們抓住了我那軟弱的弱點進攻，料定不會起來爲難牠們。但是設使眞的把雲頭打開斷送了這幾片餅乾，將叫我如何醫治馨的夜啼，所以不得不拿來放在枕邊，雖然仍舊不能穩睡，却恐怕明天難以凖六時起來，趕不上第一課，所以默數着一二三四五………依稀好像搖鈴了，我們敢多的那班秋三學生，像潮水般湧進敎室裏來。突然間有一個小孩被踏痛了脚趾，蹲在門口哭喊起來，正想過去拉他的時候，臉上拍的着了一下，驚醒過來，馨已經哭惱了性子，一雙腿擂鼓也似的甩着，怪不得夢裏好像被學生的腳步聲震得身子發晃了。實在又好笑又好氣。</p>
<p>馨，真是我的冤家！他簡直要我的命啊！一點也不原諒我做母親的一天牛馬生活，這短短六小時的睡眠，是延長生命唯一滋補品，爲什麽每夜總得啼哭到三四次，使我陪她整夜不睡，豈非要命？我曾經狠狠地責打她，但過後，我不禁淌着淚，想到她爹爹成都匯來的家用，除了半數充作滙率外，而且時間的延宕，假如沒有這個敎讀職業，眞的每月掛起了三張嘴等接濟不成？於是又耐心地哄着她睡，也讓自己求得片刻安睡，來負起明天敎喊的責任。</p>
<h3>收容所內德一張佈告</h3>
<p>— 公民</p>
<p>「爲佈吿事：查得××區難胞張××，私自擅留無符號外人，住宿區內，經値夜職員，查問屬實，並自認不諱外，合應執行連坐法，着即將該難胞連同家屬，全併開除出所。又查得××區難胞李××，品行惡劣，不守秩序，昨日由外入所，理應糾察執行職責，檢查符號，該難胞不但不遵照，並訾言相對，後糾察股提詢勸釋，態度仍然凶悍，察核其情，實屬有意擾亂秩序，爲維持全所安全計，合應開除出所，特此合併佈吿，以儆效尤！……」</p>
<p>上面的一則佈吿，是六月十四日筆者在××收容所親見的，並聞已於當日，分別執行。我見了佈吿後，不由而然的感覺到這個佈吿上的前後自相矛盾；旣是糾察遇難民進所，檢查符號，又何以有無符號的外人，在區內留宿呢？同時佈吿上的措詞，是否適合收容所身分，也是問題，如：「連坐法」，以及提詢的「提」字等，收容所變成了衙鬥，慈善云何哉！</p>
<h3>當票上的印花也要按月起息</h3>
<p>— 鏡</p>
<p>社會上款項往來，都用證據，證據上必貼足印花，百業皆然，典當業自然不能例外，但各業黏貼印花的手續，都是發據人的義務，則當票上的印花，應由當家負責無疑，但是現在雖由當店代貼，而印花費仍開入當價之內，這不但要當者負擔印花費，而還要每月負担一分八厘印花稅利息，這是什麼一規矩」？</p>
<p>霍桑探案</p>
<h3>舞後的歸宿</h3>
<p>— 程小青著</p>
<p>第二章　「一頁往史！」</p>
<p>李芝範是個五十左右的人，走路時雖彎着背，而且一路咳嗽，略略有些老態以外，他的臉色和眼睛神氣都很健旺。他的個子不高，肌肉也比較瘦削，頭髮花白，剪漪圓頂頭，也不曾留鬚。身上穿一件深靑舊縐紗的駱駝絨袍子，足上還是舊式的雙樑玄緞面的布底鞋，樸素中顯出端謹大方的模樣。後來我知道他是吳縣鄕下吳塔鎭上做私塾先生的，這種打扮，和他職業的確相稱。</p>
<p>霍桑向他招呼以後，由倪金壽從中介紹了彼此的姓名，便都在小圓桌周圍坐下來。我也就坐在長椅的一端。因着羣桑的詢問，似先着重在死者往史，老人就說明了他和死者的關係，和死者從事摟抱生活以前的景况</p>
<p>李芝範說道：「麗蘭在鄕下時的小名阿寳。他的父親就是我的內兄，也是在鄕間敎書的。麗蘭在七歲時尅了娘，丸歲時又遭父喪，以後便由我撫養，並且在我私塾裏念了好幾年書。</p>
<p>「阿寳——麗蘭在十七歲時，因著有一個同鎭的招弟從上海回鄉，才變了卦。據招弟說，在什麼工廠裏做工，進賬不錯。麗蘭聽招弟說得天花亂墜，又看見招弟打扮得像公館人家的小姐模樣，便眼紅起來啦。伊吵着要跟招弟要到上海來。我再三地勸阻，毫無效果，便也祇轉廳伊。伊一到上海，便不會回過鄉下去一决，我還以爲伊在工廠裏做工，却不知道伊在幹這個跳舞的玩意兒！到如今到底送了伊的性命！唉１眞是犯不着！」他連着嘆了一口氣，又咳了兩聲。　（十九）</p>

<h3>中國卡通首創者　萬氏兄弟會見記</h3>
<p>— 太公</p>
<p>對卡通有特殊興趣　盼努力為影業增光</p>
<p>國產電影界，從事卞通工作最卓着的，在目前就祇萬氏籟鳴，古蟾，超塵，滌寰四兄弟，現在滌寰遠在內地，超塵在主持萬氏照相館，老大籟鳴和老二古蟾，則於五月起應聘中國聯合影業公司，主持卡通部，攝製長篇卡通，現第一部「鐵扇公主」，正在積極進行中。昨日，記者到國聯廠址丁香花園去參觀，在卡通部裹和籟鳴，古蟾兩兄弟，作一番間談，這裏摘錄了一點下來：</p>
<p>從小他倆是生長於南京，一同在金陵中學攻讀，畢業後，兄弟倆聯袂來滬，同進上海美專，在志同道合下，一起研究美術和攝影，而對於卡通，也逐漸注意起來。離去美專，籟嗚就商務印書館編輯，而古蟾則服務商務印書館的電影部。</p>
<p>民國十四年，兄弟二人又雙變地進了長城影片公司，「大鬧書室」，就是否國電影界之有卡通短片的處女作。</p>
<p>民國十六年，有美人來滬創辦卡通影片公司，預備專攝卡通片，但後因營業不振，就宣吿停頓；這樣，萬氏兄弟就把那美人全部卡通機器，一起買了下來，一經試騐，居然大佳，於是「紙人搗亂記」又問世，接連，聯華的「狗偵探」，明星的「駱駝獻舞」「新生活」都先後由萬氏四兄弟合作攝成獻映一「八一三」戰事發生，籟嗚以環境不佳，先行離滬到了重慶，未幾，古蟾被聘無錫省立敎育學院，任為電影播音專修科卡通講師兼實習指導員，後來各地相繼失守，古蟾自鎭江，至南京，漢口，再到重慶，在昆明會着老大籟鳴，曾一度想辦照相館，因常鬧着警報而未成功。去年九月間，兄弟二人重回上海，籟鳴就開了個萬籟嗚照相館，至四月間，始以張善琨之邀與合作，乃加入國聯，負責主持卡通部，正部長是老二萬古蟾，老大籟鳴以照相館業務關係，所以名義上是副部長。</p>
<p>當他倆加人國聯之前，香港方面有位資本家，（亦電影界人）托孫君鏡海來滬與萬氏接治，有意邀其去港辦理卡通事業，後以國聯之邀在先，所以結果沒有去港，但萬氏會留言給孫鏡海轉言於那位資本家，說是在完成了「鐵扇公主」之後，也許可以如願的。但是，「鐵扇公主」一旦攝製成功，得到了極大的美滿的結果後，國聯方面是否肯放萬氏兄第赴港為他人工作，那倒是個問題哩</p>
<h3>好萊塢需要肉感明星</h3>
<p>— 金黃</p>
<p>—減輕體重、可以不必了。</p>
<p>女星們最怕發胖，每不惜耗費郵資忍受痛苦，以求减輕體車。體態輕盈的明星一向是被羣衆所艷羨的。但是，據說這種現象就要被推翻了。不久以前，在新片“Lillian　Eussell”裹，選取了六十名肥女參加演出，不過她們是表演一八九〇年的風格。</p>
<p>以後恐怕還有更多擢用肥胖女演員的機會呢。戰爭曾使好來塢發生變化的，歐洲的市塲巳經縮小，影片公司唯有向南美發展，面南美的觀衆是不歡迎瘦弱的女星的。月下就斷定好萊塢必須這樣轉變，似乎還早。不過者是可能的，你看，梅蕙絲不是很吸引了一大羣富有鑑賞力的觀衆嗎，其實，像瓊克勞馥那樣時髦的體態，未免有些束縛自然吧。</p>
<h3>「白雲故鄉」在轟炸中完成</h3>
<p>— 亦星</p>
<p>司徒慧敏導演之「白雲故鄉」最後一景，是攝製該滬女主角鳳子之家，佈景是香港的海邊上，一間華麗的小洋房，有海水，有沙灘，更有矗立在海的那邊的高山，這塲景一部，份是在香港實地攝製的，一部份是在該廠攝影塲中搭成的，由該廠美工組全體同人設計打樣，費星期餘時間始搭成。</p>
<p>攝製該景最後一個鏡頭的時候，恰巧是日機轟炸第慶的當兒，該片全體同人猶在轟炸中鎮靜地將最後一個鏡頭攝完</p>
<p>又軍委會政治部陳部長（誠），傳副司令長官（作義），是日曾參觀該片之攝製，對該片全體工作人員之努力工作，頗為讚許，並與該片全體工作人員合留一影，以資紀念。</p>
<h3>派拉蒙起用新人</h3>
<p>派拉蒙影片公司攝製神怪片「一月十六日之夜」，男主角唐阿曼契中途退出，調解無效。派拉蒙巳向法院起訴，要求賠償損失十七萬元事，巳誌日前本欄。頃悉：派拉蒙原請克勞黛考爾白擔任該片女主角，被謝絕，乃請白蓓拉史丹妃担任，可是當唐阿曼契半途退出時，白蓓拉史丹妃也跟着不願再攝，該片祇得暫時擱置。好萊塢明星中，向以唐阿曼契的性情最稱和善，所以這决中途變卦，使外界很覺驚異，派拉蒙公司最後決定選用新進女明星派特烈西亞摩麗遜（Patricia　Marrison）和雷密倫分任該片男女主角，而原來導演該片的米契爾萊森（Mitehell　Leisen）也巳調去改任戰爭小說“La　Polonaise”一片的導演。</p>

<h3>Meeting of German and Italian Giants in Munich: Discussing Conditions for Peace Negotiations with France; France Declares Need for Honorable Peace</h3>
<p>Rome: Italian Prime Minister Mussolini departed from Rome at midnight yesterday en route to the German-Italian border to meet with German leader Hitler. It is generally believed that this meeting is of decisive historical importance. Mussolini's departure was without any send-off ceremony. Accompanying him were Foreign Minister Ciano, Cabinet Office Director Sebastiani, and Deputy Chief of Staff General Roto. It is reported that Chief of Staff General Badoglio will also accompany them to Germany. (Hai Tong Electric Dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Munich: Hitler's special train arrived at the Munich train station this afternoon. German and Italian flags were hung in the station, and flags were flying almost everywhere in the streets. As Hitler's car passed through the streets, cheers thundered. It is said that the Quelz Royal Palace has been reserved as Mussolini's residence. When Mussolini arrived in Munich in September 1938, he used this palace as his residence. (Hai Tong Electric Dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Munich: Hitler and Mussolini began their historically significant meeting concerning the fate and future of France at 4:00 PM today (12:00 AM Shanghai time) at Hitler's residence. According to Italian official sources here, the Axis powers will continue the war until France submits to peace terms. According to Berlin newspapers that arrived this afternoon, the peace terms are very harsh because Germany will conduct a complete reckoning of France's attitude over the past twenty-one years. The talks between the two leaders took place at Hitler's residence at 4:00 PM, with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, Italian Foreign Minister Ciano, and German Chief of Staff Keitel in attendance. Hitler arrived here by special train at 12:05 PM, while Mussolini arrived at 3:05 PM with Foreign Minister Ciano and more than 30 other Italian officials. (United Press Dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Munich: According to official sources here, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, accompanied by other Italian dignitaries, arrived at Munich Central Station at 3:00 PM this afternoon. German leader Hitler personally welcomed them at the station and immediately reviewed the honor guard. They then traveled together to Charles Royal Palace. German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and Italian Foreign Minister Ciano rode in the same car. Italian Deputy Chief of Staff General Roda was accompanied by General Keitel to the Royal Palace. At 4:00 PM, Mussolini, accompanied by Ribbentrop and Ciano, went from Charles Royal Palace to the leader's villa. Hitler greeted them at the bottom of the steps, and they immediately began talks in the study. Ribbentrop and Keitel also participated. When Mussolini's train passed through various parts of Germany, it received a warm welcome from the public. Director of Protocol of the German Foreign Ministry, Shessburg, also welcomed the special train in Innsbruck. (Hai Tong Electric Dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Berlin: When a Japanese reporter asked a German Foreign Ministry spokesperson whether the meeting between Hitler and Mussolini would be a long or short gathering, the reply was cold and witty, implying that the world knows the habits of the German and Italian leaders regarding quick decisions or lengthy deliberations, and what is appropriate is self-evident. (Hai Tong Electric Dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>London: French radio announced this afternoon that France had, at 12:30 PM today, asked the Vatican to convey the issue of peace to Italy, saying that France hoped for an honorable peace and would never surrender unconditionally. (United Press Dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>France's Backbone is Not Broken, Determined to Fight for Freedom</p>
<p>London: After French Prime Minister General Pétain's important broadcast yesterday, stating "We must give up fighting," the actual situation in France remains chaotic. Initially, it was generally thought that this broadcast meant that the French army would stop fighting. However, according to reports from the front lines, the fighting continued all day yesterday. Therefore, it is now said that General Pétain's</p>
<p>Japan Closely Watches the Development of the European Situation</p>
<p>Tokyo: Japanese newspapers are now publishing news favorable to Germany. It is reported that official and non-official circles are closely watching the possible future developments in Europe, fearing that they will affect French colonies. The Asahi Shimbun said that some circles are now advocating that France should place French Vietnam and New Caledonia under the joint guarantee of Britain and Japan, because the status of these two places greatly affects Japan's security. It also said that we can no longer ignore Germany's remarks on this East Asian colonial issue, and its future trend will be greatly related to Japan's southward policy. (Reuters Dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>wording may have been misunderstood. It does not mean that France will unconditionally cease fire now, but that if Germany offers "honorable peace," then France will cease fire. It is expected that within the next 24 hours, any doubts about this point will be dispelled, and it will be clearly shown whether the war will continue. (Reuters Dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Bordeaux: Non-official but well-informed circles here today issued an implication that if the German army attempts to advance too far in France, it may encounter an "unpleasant surprise." They also said that the backbone of the French nation is not yet broken, and the French army is still in genuine combat, not just spreading orders to cease fire. (Reuters Dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>New York: According to news here, the French government radio station declared that the claim that the French government is about to lay down its arms is absolutely untrue. France is only asking Germany under what conditions it can begin to stop the slaughter of French brothers. (Reuters Dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>News of Ceasefire Spreads, People Remain Calm as Usual</p>
<p>New York: The Columbia Broadcasting Company broadcast yesterday from Bordeaux about the state of the French people accepting the news that the enemy army had ceased resistance, saying that when the people in the city went to cafes to listen to the new Prime Minister Pétain's broadcast speech, they were as quiet as could be imagined, and there was no demonstration by the crowd. The people seemed stunned by the sudden news, but all clearly paid silent attention to it. The spokesperson of the broadcasting company said that the French army had maintained peace in Europe for many years, and the consequences of today's defeat for Europe and the United States must be very significant. As far as I know, the war has not stopped, and the people are too tired and too confused to think about tomorrow. I have not seen anyone shed tears, nor have I seen any other expressions. Everything is too sudden, too important, making them at a loss as to how to deal with it. (Reuters Dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Spanish Ambassador to France Strives for Peace</p>
<p>Madrid: News here last night said that Germany has invited Spain to participate in the German-French peace negotiations. Diplomatic circles believe that French Foreign Minister Baudouin has asked the Spanish Ambassador to France to mediate between France and Germany. It is said that Baudouin sent a secret document to the Spanish Ambassador yesterday. The content of the document is extremely confidential, but it is believed to be a request from the French side. (United Press Dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Madrid: Spanish Ambassador to France, Lequerica, arrived in Irun, on the French-Spanish border, today from Bordeaux. The public is paying close attention to Lequerica's whereabouts because General Pétain stated that the French government had asked a Spanish diplomat to inform the German side of France's peace request and asked the German government to hand over the peace terms to Lequerica for transmission to the French government. (Hai Tong Electric Dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>French Naval Power is Intact, Rumor of Transfer to British Command</p>
<p>New York: The New York Financial Daily reported that there are various signs indicating that France has transferred its navy to the command of the British Admiralty. (Reuters Dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Bordeaux: A spokesperson for the port military authorities recently said that our decision to seek peace is due to the extremely serious situation of the army on land. Seeking peace is not a sign of despair, and our naval power is intact and our air force is still strong. This fact occupies an important position in future peace negotiations and must be stated. In addition, after noon today, the front-line fighting is still going on. Our army is holding positions in the area from Paris to the Loire River and is launching counter-attacks against the enemy in several places. (Havas Electric Dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>German Army Continues to Exert Pressure, War Has Not Yet Stopped</p>
<p>Bordeaux Port: The French General Headquarters issued a war report tonight stating, "Fighting continued today at various points on the front line, especially in the middle reaches of the Loire River, with particularly fierce fighting in the cities of Orleans and Chalette. (1) Some units of the enemy army crossed the Loire River and have been blocked by a certain canal on the side. (2) The enemy army continues to advance east of the Loire River. (3) In the province of Poitou, the enemy army has already entered the city of Dijon. (4) In the Franche-Comté region, the German army has already reached the Doubs River, and its mechanized units have invaded the Jura Mountains. In short, our army is continuing to fight bravely at various points on the front line." (Havas Electric Dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>Berlin: Hitler will immediately announce that the French Metz Fortress has surrendered to a German division. (Reuters Dispatch, 18th) The artillery fire near two sections of the Siegfried Line, near the Swiss border in Basel, was very dense last night, and the windows of the houses were shaken. The artillery fire from the French Maginot Line was sparse, with the sound of artillery intermittent until yesterday. (United Press Dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Berlin: Well-informed and responsible sources told a Hai Tong News Agency reporter last night that the German army is continuing to advance with all its strength in France because the surrender has not yet been signed, so there has been no ceasefire to date. Any French troops who still attempt to resist will be crushed. Most of the French troops in various places have complied with General Pétain's declaration and laid down their arms. French troops are surrendering in divisions, as the Western Front fighting continued for several days after Germany requested a ceasefire in 1918. (Hai Tong Electric Dispatch, 18th)</p>
<h3>German Army War Report</h3>
<p>Hitler's Headquarters: The German army war report this afternoon stated that the French army, under the pressure of the German army, continues to collapse. The Wona River has been crossed at several points, and the German army has reached the Loire River. German mechanized units have occupied the Belfort Fortress and the Le Creusot-Tione Fortress, the center of French armaments. It was occupied by the German army without fighting. The German army took this opportunity to copy the still defending Didenhofen on both sides of the Maginot Line, implementing a strategy of encircling the rear. More than 100,000 enemies were captured yesterday alone, including entire armies. The German Air Force pursued the enemy between the Loire River and the Atlantic Ocean. The railway station in Laner was bombed by German aircraft, and only trains carrying military supplies and gasoline were hit and exploded, with a loud noise. Several transport ships at the mouth of the Loire River were bombed or severely damaged, including two ships with a load of 30,000 tons, two ships with a load of 20,000 thousand tons, one ship with a load of 20,000 tons, and four ships with a load of more than 10,000 tons, as well as several small warships and cargo ships, a total of nine ships were sunk and more than one was on fire and exploded, resulting in severe damage. Last night, enemy aircraft attacked the northwest of Germany and non-military-related buildings. A total of five enemy aircraft were lost yesterday, and only one German aircraft was missing.

<h3>Will Never Lay Down Arms Unless Honorable Peace is Obtained; French Foreign Minister Delivers Broadcast Speech</h3>
<p>Bordeaux Port: French Foreign Minister Baudouin recently delivered a broadcast speech to the people of the country, saying, "Whenever our country encounters a time when it must decide what to choose, it always values honor above all else. Although the German army relies on its large number of personnel and sophisticated weapons, it has still failed to depress our country's morale. "This time, the people of our country are united and go to the country's difficulties together, which is unprecedented in the history of our country. Even at this moment, our determination and the honor of our army have not been damaged in the slightest. However, the new cabinet has made the necessary decisions due to the situation. In this serious period, we must solemnly declare that France still loves independence and still has confidence in the country's future. If we can obtain an honorable peace, we can cease fire, but any shameful conditions that would cause the people of our country to lose their spiritual freedom are absolutely unacceptable to us. In other words, if the French army and the entire French nation have a choice between resistance and humiliation, it is not difficult to make a decisive decision. As for Britain, it has continuously assisted in this war with its sea, land, and air forces, which is very admirable." (Havas Electric Dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>Bordeaux Port: The French government issued a statement last night stating, "After General Pétain's speech, misunderstandings have already been caused by the outside world, which are inconsistent with the facts, such as saying that the government of the country has already ordered a ceasefire, which is not the truth. In fact, the war will continue to be impoverished until the conditions for a ceasefire are agreed upon between France and Germany one day. In short, although the situation is serious, our will has not been depressed, and our strength is still sufficient to defend ourselves. France exists, and the world can continue to exist. This belief has become stronger over time. If the conditions for a ceasefire are harmful to France's honor and independence, then we must continue to fight. This has been explained by Foreign Minister Baudouin in a broadcast speech yesterday afternoon." (Havas Electric Dispatch, 17th)</p>

<h3>Rome's Gains: Armistice Conditions</h3>
<p>Rome: Authoritative sources claimed today that German leader Hitler and Italian leader Mussolini will draft armistice terms for France within 48 hours following their meeting today. According to these conditions, the anti-communist powers, including Japan, will divide France and its territories in the following ways: (1) Germany will receive Alsace and Lorraine, as well as the "majority" of French colonies. (2) Italy will receive Nice, Savoy, part of Algeria, Corsica, Djibouti, and other parts of French African territories. (3) Spain will receive French Monaco or the French Basque province. (4) Japan will receive certain French territories in the Far East and the Pacific, notably French Vietnam. (5) Belgium will receive several French ports along the English Channel, but only on the condition that Belgium forms a close military and political alliance with Germany.

<h3>Analysis and Prospects of France's Armistice</h3>
<p>As this commentary is being written, telegrams from all over the world are reporting conflicting news. In short, the European situation has fallen into an extremely chaotic state, and the future of Europe is approaching an extremely contradictory fork in the road. But this chaos and contradiction cannot last for long. Everything will probably be clear within a few dozen hours. The only thing that is certain at the moment is that on the 17th, the day before yesterday, the newly appointed Prime Minister of France, General Pétain, did, on behalf of the French government, announce to his enemies and his people his intention to prepare for an armistice. Let us now analyze this point.</p>
<p>If what General Pétain announced ultimately becomes a reality, then German leader Hitler's strategy of divide and conquer will once again achieve victory. Long before the outbreak of the war, observers in various countries, even those governing countries, had seen clearly that the Allied forces of Britain and France had two of the most serious weaknesses: First, France's human resources were at an absolute disadvantage. Second, the imbalance in the tasks undertaken by Britain and France in land warfare was enough to make it difficult for the authorities on both sides to manage appropriately. For the past two or three years, Britain and France have appeared harmonious and seamless on the surface, almost seeming to be one entity. But in reality, both sides have had an extremely serious problem, which the authorities on both sides have pondered deeply, meticulously, and painstakingly, and tried to manage appropriately, but have never exposed this dispute: the issue of Britain implementing conscription. In the end, although Britain reluctantly agreed, it was not completely resolved, and it became a hidden source of dispute. On the French side, former Allied Commander General Gamelin attached even greater importance to this issue. On the British side, far-sighted people like Eden, Hoare, and Belisha, over the course of two or three years, also repeatedly and tirelessly called for and advocated the early implementation of universal conscription. However, due to the obstruction of many stubborn forces, a half-hearted conscription system was implemented only on the eve of the declaration of war. When the disaster of war came, Britain did its best to send an expeditionary force, and although the French side repeatedly praised it in the friendliest manner, in reality, it could not meet France's hopes, let alone military needs. Therefore, on the one hand, it caused a part of the French people to develop a mood of defeatism and to harbor pessimism about the future of the war. On the other hand, it also made France recognize the difficulties and dangers from the facts and reason. They recognized that Britain could not be deeply relied upon. This was the annoyance that both Britain and France gritted their teeth and did not want to reveal in the slightest, and it was also the inside story that those who sympathized with Britain and France and knew their internal affairs did not want to reveal from the sidelines. It was also what the German and Italian propaganda machines took as excellent material and used in many ways.</p>
<p>By the time the central figures of Britain and France succeeded each other, that is, when Britain's Churchill and France's Reynaud took the stage and formed cabinets one after another, it was generally expected that France's aforementioned hidden pain and estrangement with Britain could be dispelled without a trace, strengthening the psychological and rational basis of the alliance between the two countries, so that the future victory or defeat would become a common destiny of complete coincidence. Unexpectedly, even the warmest enthusiasm could not make up for the extremely serious facts. With Churchill and Reynaud, these two outstanding figures with vision and courage, finally unable to salvage the almost congenital defects, France had to abandon its vows to advance, retreat, and fight together with Britain, and unilaterally declared an armistice. Whether friends or enemies of France, no one in humanity should not shed tears of sympathy for France!</p>
<p>War must be fought with the life and death of the nation, and life and death are of course put aside, but victory and defeat are not accidental. To put it succinctly, the key lies in quickly seizing the other side's weaknesses: First, he has the danger of being attacked on both sides, that is, what he fears most is fighting on the eastern and western fronts at the same time. Second, he has the necessity of relying on foreign countries, that is, what he cannot withstand is being blockaded tightly for a long time. Britain and France knew their weaknesses, wanted to seize them, and planned to seize them, and gradually implemented their seizure, but they lost out on not being quick enough. If they had immediately seized it at the moment when the German-Polish War broke out, that is, nine months ago, then what situation would appear today is something that no one dares to say.</p>
<p>Britain and France repeatedly missed the opportunity, and from everything to everything, they had to go through a kind of delay, a kind of frustration, and then they were in a passive position, and no matter how long they were, they could not发挥 them. In contrast, Germany seized its own opportunity, seized the other side's weaknesses, tightly grasped France's fatal injury, and used its unique "lightning war" tactics, pouring the strength of the whole country, like a wind and cloud, and a quick battle, almost like destroying the old and decaying and deciding. This made France's first weakness of a lack of manpower completely exposed without room for breathing, and it fell into an irremediable situation. And Italy's sudden participation in the war, at least spiritually, dealt France a serious blow. In this moment of survival and extinction, although Britain and France were subjectively in a common destiny, objectively, the degree of their hardships and encounters was completely different. Thus, the second weakness that could not be shared between the two countries exploded.</p>
<p>Telegrams from all over the world, as of when the reporter is writing, are only enough to make retrospective explanations, not enough to make future inferences. As for how the trend of the nearest future will be decided, it still does not go beyond the key points that this newspaper obtained yesterday. To put it simply, to repeat: First, the conditions of Germany and Italy will not be recognized by France, and there is a risk of renewed incidents. Second, how the French Navy is has become the most important factor in whether France can obtain peace, whether Britain will continue to fight, that is, the future Berlin battle situation. Third, the attitudes of the Soviet Union, Spain, Turkey, and the United States, directly or indirectly, latently or overtly, will inevitably be a major weight in the future situation.</p>
<p>The world is now standing on a fork in the road. We should closely watch the reports of the next few dozen hours!</p>
<h3>France Encounters Misfortune, Britain's Determination to Fight Increases, Will Not Stop Until the Nazi Threat is Eliminated; British Prime Minister Churchill Delivers Broadcast Speech</h3>
<p>London: Prime Minister Churchill delivered a broadcast speech last night, declaring that although France has surrendered, Britain will continue to fight with unwavering determination. He said, "The events that have occurred in France have not changed Britain's beliefs and goals in the slightest. We have now become the only hero holding a weapon to defend universalism. We will do our best to live up to this noble honor. We will defend this island and fight together with the British Empire around us without being overcome by the enemy, until everyone's brow no longer curses Hitler. We dare to decide that we will eventually win. "The Prime Minister also said, "I am very sad that the heroic people of France have fallen into this tragic misfortune. Our emotions towards them and our belief that the genius of France will be revived will not be changed by anything." (Reuters Dispatch, 18th)</p>
<h3>British Prime Minister Reports on the War Situation in the House of Commons: States Reasons for France's Surrender; Britain Has Fulfilled its Greatest Obligation of Assistance</h3>
<p>London: Today, the House of Commons was packed with people to listen to Prime Minister Churchill deliver the most important speech of the war, stating the reasons why France requested Germany to cease hostilities. His speech was roughly as follows:</p>
<p>The other day, I mentioned that when the French Commander-in-Chief discovered that the German army had decisively broken through the French defense line at Sedan and the Meuse River, he did not immediately withdraw the troops north of that area, resulting in a major military disaster. His indecisiveness caused the French army to lose fifteen or sixteen divisions, and made it impossible for the entire British Expeditionary Force to exert its power to cope with this critical period. Our army and 120,000 French troops were trapped in Dunkirk. Thanks to the efforts of the British Navy, they escaped danger, but the only losses were artillery and modern military equipment. This setback will inevitably require several weeks to make up for the losses. From then on, the French army repeatedly suffered defeats, and this was the reason. We will do everything possible to re-equip and send every soldier we can to France as soon as possible, and transport their military supplies.</p>
<p>All the conquered countries will be restored in the future. The great battle of France is over, and the great battle of Britain is about to begin. If we are unfortunately defeated, the whole world, including the United States, will sink into the abyss of a new dark age. The great battle of France failed due to unfortunate flaws in military strategy. This flaw was caused by the unprecedented capabilities of the German armored divisions and the fact that the number of German troops exceeded that of the Allied forces.</p>
<p>Britain now has 1.25 million soldiers in arms, 500,000 local volunteer defense groups, and a large number of military supplies, rifles and bullets salvaged in France. In addition, there are large armies from the Dominions and the Royal Navy to help. (Cheers) At present, we need to be very cautious and not afraid of hard work, but there is no need to panic at all. (Great cheers)</p>
<p>If France does not continue to fight in accordance with its treaty obligations, it will abandon its great opportunity and its future. We feel that this treaty obligation cannot be avoided.</p>
<p>We must now adhere to our duties and do our best. If the British Empire and the Commonwealth exist for a thousand years, the people should still say that this was one of their greatest moments. (Prolonged cheers) I am stating these facts not to blame anyone. In my personal judgment, it is completely useless (cheers) and even harmful to launch attacks at this time. We can hardly tolerate it. The reason why I am stating these facts is to clarify that we have not been able to participate in this great war with twelve or thirteen divisions of the British army, as we should have been able to, but only three divisions participated. All of this will be put aside, and future historians will refer to all the documents and make a fair judgment.</p>
<p>This small principle can also be applied to our own domestic affairs. Now there are many people who want to investigate why the actions of the government and Congress in recent years have led to this current disaster. They attempt to blame those responsible for guiding our affairs. (The audience shouts, "Hear, hear!") This is also a foolish and harmful act. There are indeed many people responsible for this. Now everyone should act according to their conscience and constantly reflect on their words, just as I reflect on myself. I dare say that if we start a dispute between the past and the present, we will surely lose our future. (The audience shouts, "Hear, hear!" (Reuters dispatch, 18th)</p>
<h3>Britain Proposed to France the Formation of a United Nation: To Concentrate Forces to Encircle Justice and Freedom; Ceasefire Plan of France Failed to Materialize</h3>
<p>London: The British Broadcasting Corporation has just issued a message stating that the British government, in order to assist France, yesterday proposed to the French government that the two countries solemnly conclude a joint convention, and submitted a draft declaration to France, stating that the governments of Britain and France declare that they will be a united nation of Britain and France from now on and will no longer be divided into two countries. (Havas dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>London: In order to assist and support France through the serious period it is experiencing and to encourage the French government to continue to fight, the British government proposed a solemn joint action between the two countries, so the following draft was delivered to the French government on June 16 by the British Ambassador to France. The original text is as follows: 1. At this most important moment in the modern world, the British and French governments declare their inseparable union and unwavering determination to jointly defend justice and freedom from succumbing to a system that reduces mankind to puppets and slaves. The two governments now declare that Britain and France are no longer two countries, but a single Anglo-French Union. The organization of this union will provide for joint defense, diplomacy, finance, and economic policies. Every French citizen will immediately enjoy British citizenship, and every British citizen will become a citizen of France. The two countries will share the responsibility for restoring the war damage within their territories. The resources of both sides will be used equally for this purpose as a whole. During the war, there should be a single war cabinet, and all British and French naval and air forces will be under its command. The British Empire is already raising new troops, and France will transfer all the forces it can use to the land, sea and air battlefields. This union calls on the United States to consolidate the resources of the Allied countries and to provide strong material assistance for the common purpose. This union will concentrate all its efforts to resist the enemy's forces, no matter where the war occurs, and strive for our final victory. According to responsible sources here, this declaration of Anglo-French Union is based on France continuing to fight. Now that France has requested a ceasefire, this plan may be considered temporarily a thing of the past, but if there is a possibility of a change in the future environment, the suggestion may be considered again.

<h3>Britain Continues to Call Up New Recruits</h3>
<p>London: According to a statement issued by the Ministry of Labor yesterday, in July, men of the third class will continue to be registered to serve in the military. The statement said that the number of people being called up is increasing rapidly, and the physical examination is being accelerated.

The third registration in July is for men who have reached the age of 30, 31, and 32. Those who have reached the age of 29 will register on the 22nd of this month. So far, a total of 2.8 million men have registered. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)</p>

<h3>British Dominions Intensify Assistance to Britain in the War: Australia is Virtually Becoming the Empire's Arsenal; New Zealand Implements Compulsory Conscription</h3>
<p>Sydney: Australia has become the arsenal of the British Empire. The depth charge bombs used by American destroyers to attack enemy submarines are Australian products. Soon, Australian-made aircraft bombs will also fall on the enemy's front and rear lines. Australian-made weapons, from the smallest to the largest, are numerous. Official and private factories are now working day and night, producing and transporting them in a steady stream. From September 1, last year to March 31, this year, the various items ordered by the Department of Supply cost over £14.45 million. This can slightly explain the speed of Australia's war organization development since the outbreak of the war. Since then, expenses have gradually increased, and now Australia's defense expenses have increased to between 5 and 6 million per month. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Wellington: The New Zealand government today ordered the implementation of compulsory conscription. The regulations stipulate that men aged 16 and some of those selected from the reservists will be formed into a general reserve army. Reservists will be selected by lottery.

According to eyewitnesses, many people were killed and injured on the spot, but the crowd gathered more and more and gathered in front of the post office and the police station. At 8:15 p.m., the crowd attempted to attack the police station, so both sides opened fire. The crowd retreated, and the police received reinforcements from the army, defeated the demonstrating crowd, and sent armored vehicles to patrol the streets. At 11:30 p.m., the city was cleared, but the suburbs were still in chaos. Last night, Soviet tanks, mechanized infantry, and artillery arrived in Lajing. The Soviet troops then sent tanks to defend the main traffic arteries in the city and occupied the post office and the train station. Telephone communication between Latvia and foreign countries was once cut off late at night. Last night at 10 o'clock, the president issued a broadcast, calling on the people to maintain a calm attitude. (Haitong dispatch, 18th)</p>

<h3>United States Will Not Recognize Transfer of Territorial Rights in the Western Hemisphere: This Bill Passed by the Senate; United States Stops Paying French Credit Loans and Funds</h3>
<p>Washington: The Senate passed an important bill last night stating that the United States will not recognize any non-American country transferring the territory of the Western Hemisphere to another non-American country. It is reported that this bill will be submitted to the House of Representatives for a vote today. (Associated Press dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Washington: US Secretary of State Hull told reporters yesterday that the State Department is closely studying all the problems arising from the recent developments in Europe, but there is absolutely no news about France's request for a ceasefire. The future of the French colonies in the Western Hemisphere is also one of the issues under study. The State Department does not believe that there is any change in the status of the US Ambassador to Paris or the French Ambassador to Washington. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Washington: Senators Connally and Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, are urging the immediate passage of legislation declaring that the United States will not acquiesce to any non-American country transferring its colonies in the Western Hemisphere to another non-American country. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Washington: According to some well-informed sources here, senior administrative officials have suggested that the United States should completely sever diplomatic relations with Germany and Italy to express sympathy for the Allied countries and eliminate the activities of the "Fifth Column."

Secretary of State Hull and Undersecretary of State Welles jointly visited President Roosevelt to discuss the latest developments in the European situation. (Haitong dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>US Government is Studying Controlling the American Economy</p>
<p>Washington: The US Government Committee has received an order from President Roosevelt to begin studying the plan for the Western Hemisphere to deal with the business groups of totalitarian countries. The White House announced that the President has issued an order to temporarily freeze France's deposits in the United States, totaling $1.1 billion, to prevent Germany from withdrawing funds for reparations. Officials said that the business groups of North and South American countries can negotiate conditions with Germany to avoid being hit by the German-controlled European economic group when each country negotiates separately. When the committee began discussing, Secretary of State Hull hurriedly arrived and met with Roosevelt. Secretary of the Treasury Morgenthau, Secretary of Commerce Hopkins, Secretary of Agriculture Wallace, and accompanying advisors all participated in the meeting, which lasted two hours before adjourning. Hull announced that details of the meeting would be published soon. At the same time, the White House announced that the committee had studied the trade problems of American countries with Europe. The final report will be submitted to the President in a short period of time. If the President approves this plan, he will submit it to the governments of American countries for their opinions. If the British Empire collapses, the United States will also invite the Dominions of Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the Union of South Africa to participate in this plan. It is said that US Army and Navy experts are waiting for telegrams from Europe, hoping to obtain news about the fate of the French fleet. They believe that if the French Navy also surrenders to Germany, the end of the British Isles is approaching. Authoritative sources said that the Western Hemisphere business plan has not yet been specifically determined and will be finalized according to the development of the European situation. The committee is considering three possible approaches: (1) The organization of an agency by the American countries to control the import and export trade of the Western Hemisphere countries. (2) Purchasing the surplus export goods of Latin American countries for resale. (3) The customs union of the American countries unifies the tariff barriers of Western Hemisphere commerce. It is generally believed that this plan will constitute a supplement to the British blockade against Germany, but this decision will make countries such as Belgium and France feel hunger like Germany, and its impact is very subtle. (International dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Washington: The White House announced today that the Committee has studied the most effective way to export surplus goods from the Western Hemisphere and make it profitable, and the matter is now imminent. Responsible circles here explained that a Pan-American Trading Company will be established, and the American countries will be shareholders. The United States will provide the majority of the capital. The company will purchase all exports at an average price and grant foreign sovereignty at the highest price possible. However, most of the transactions will be at a loss. This plan has the nature of the United States subsidizing several American countries. It is now believed that the intention is to prevent the continued intrusion of German economic power into South America. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Military Supplies Ordered by France to be Received by the British Government</p>
<p>Washington: According to an announcement last night, President Roosevelt will not comment on France's decision at this time, but is closely watching developments in Europe. Reliable sources on Wall Street in New York said that the British government intends to accept all war supplies ordered by France in the United States and add to them as much as the United States can produce. The Anglo-French Purchasing Commission has ordered materials worth more than £400 million, most of which are aircraft. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Washington: US Treasury Secretary Morgenthau announced yesterday that he had received notification that all purchase agreements for military supplies concluded between France and the United States, as a result of the surrender of the French army, will be inherited by Britain. According to the Anglo-French Purchasing Commission, the value of the aircraft ordered in the United States by the Anglo-French Purchasing Commission has reached $1 billion. On May 31, the committee ordered 7,000 aircraft, of which 2,000 have already been delivered. The other 5,000 were granted special transportation facilities last month by order of Secretary of State Hull, allowing American aviators to fly the aircraft to Canadian ports for shipment.

<h3>Roosevelt Signs the Military Expansion Bill: Adds 22 Warships</h3>
<p>Washington: The House and Senate passed the naval expansion bill a few days ago, stipulating that the number of naval aircraft should be increased to 10,000, the number of pilots to 16,000, and 22 warships should be added. This bill was recently signed into law by President Roosevelt. In addition, the government authorities have also formulated a new military expansion bill, advocating an allocation of $2 billion to start building 84 warships of various types. (Havas dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>Washington: Vincent, Chairman of the House Naval Committee, submitted a bill to the House of Representatives today to increase the total tonnage of the US fleet by 23 percent.

This funding will be used for the construction of warships, increasing the total tonnage of the US fleet to 2,000,000 tons, making it the most powerful navy in the world. (Haitong dispatch, 18th)</p>

<p>Yichang Battlefield. The repeated battle for Yichang continues fiercely. On the 17th, at noon, the Japanese sent massive reinforcements to counterattack Yichang. Fierce fighting broke out again in the area outside Yichang's East Gate. Chinese troops defended strategic points and engaged the Japanese in fierce combat. At the same time, the main force moved directly behind the Japanese, bravely pursuing them. This morning, they had already occupied the line of Dabao Mountain and Shanzishan (both east of Yichang), cutting off the connection between the Japanese and Dangyang. Furthermore, they extended south, occupying the line of Jinbaling and Sanyuanqiao (both southeast of Yichang), completely severing the Japanese communication with Jingzhou and Shashi. Thus, a tight encirclement of the remaining Japanese troops on the eastern side of Yichang was completed. (18th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Yicheng. Crossing to the east bank of the Xiang River, and with swift action and careful deployment behind the Japanese, the bulk of the troops have rapidly completed the river crossing under the Japanese's watch. On the evening of the 10th, they safely reached the other bank and immediately advanced in separate routes, launching fierce attacks on various key points occupied by the Japanese. One route of Chinese troops advanced rapidly toward Changshou Town and Fengle River (both north of Zhongxiang) at a rate of twelve li per day. The Japanese troops panicked and were at a loss. The Chinese army, with lightning speed, charged into the Japanese formation from all sides, engaging in horizontal and vertical slashing, leaving no survivors. Consequently, the two locations were completely recovered. Without rest, they immediately closely coordinated with the Chinese troops on the east bank, each advancing toward predetermined targets.

<h3>Japan Issues Threatening Remarks Regarding Vietnam</h3>
<p>Guangzhou. According to the second statement issued by the Japanese army regarding the transportation of military supplies through Vietnam, the Japanese Air Force is now paying attention to traffic on the National Defense Highway to verify whether France is transporting military materials to help the government led by General Chiang Kai-shek. This matter is now even more open. The statement also said that Japanese aircraft once discovered a convoy of trucks near the border. Just as they were preparing to attack, the trucks unfurled French flags, thus avoiding being bombed. The Japanese side has released a photograph showing several trucks fully loaded with military materials, allegedly transported from Vietnam to the interior, as an "indisputable proof."

<h3>Japan Warns Foreign Residents in Chongqing; US Ambassador Decides to Ignore; Never Recognized Japan's Right to Bombardment; No So-Called Safe Zone on the South Bank of the Yangtze River</h3>
<p>Chongqing. Despite warnings from the Japanese, foreign residents here are still staying in Chongqing, residing near the British, Soviet, and German embassies. The French embassy is currently seeking a site on the south bank of the Yangtze River, but not because of Japanese warnings, but because staff cannot work under continuous bombing. The US, Italian, and Belgian embassies are all on the south bank of the Yangtze River. The US Ambassador is now ignoring Japanese warnings, insisting that the United States has never recognized Japan's right to bomb Chongqing, nor the so-called safe zone on the south bank of the Yangtze River. (18th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>Three Japanese Planes Shot Down the Day Before Yesterday</p>
<p>Chongqing. Japanese planes attacked Chongqing in successive days. Today, they came in four batches to bomb, dropping more than 400 new-style "super-heavy bombs", killing and wounding approximately 300 civilians, and damaging many hospitals and schools. However, the Japanese planes also suffered extremely heavy losses. A Havas reporter witnessed the passage of the first batch of Japanese planes as they attacked Chongqing. The second to fourth air raids, however, all happened in the suburbs and could not be seen. The first batch of Japanese planes that flew over Chongqing consisted of 36 heavy bombers. At that time, it was 1:30 pm. Fifteen Chinese fighter planes were patrolling in the sky. Seeing the Japanese planes flying in, they immediately swooped down and attacked them, with some attacking from the side. A Japanese plane was immediately hit and caught fire, crashing in the eastern suburbs of Chongqing. At 2:30 pm, the second batch of Japanese planes arrived, totaling 27. The Chinese fighter planes immediately flew to intercept them. Because it was farther from the city, the details of the battle could not be witnessed. However, it is known that approximately three Japanese planes were shot down this time. Most of the bombs dropped by the Japanese planes fell into the river. The wooden houses inhabited by poor people along the coast were all destroyed. The western and central districts of Chongqing were also bombed, with black smoke billowing everywhere, from the western district to the entire city. The American gunboat "Tutela" was docked on the south bank of the Yangtze River and was almost hit. The French Catholic Church suffered the most damage, and its adjacent school was completely destroyed. At the same time, the American Methodist Women's School was also completely destroyed, and many civilian houses caught fire after being hit, and are still burning. Furthermore, according to military experts, the Japanese planes used the latest type of bombs for the first time today, and their destructive power is quite strong. From the losses suffered in the bombing in recent days, it can be seen that the Japanese air raids on Chongqing are purely terrorist in nature. The bombs they dropped have no specific targets, and most of them fell in densely populated areas. For example, the Chongqing Hotel, where foreign residents and journalists from various countries reside, was also destroyed. (17th Havas Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Procedures for Replacing Lost National Assembly Representative Certificates</h3>

<h3>In the Midst of Great Changes in the European War: The Position of French Indochina</h3>
<p>Although the European war has caused France to expend large amounts of financial and military resources, the grand plan for protecting the security of Vietnam, carried out by France, has not been reduced.</p>
<p>Since the summer of 1937, the military expenditure spent by France on the fortification of this rich and prosperous colony has exceeded 3,000,000,000 francs. In addition, in the budgets of the Vietnamese government for 1938 and 1939, 40,000,000 Vietnamese piasters were added each year for national defense. At the ordinary price of Vietnamese currency, one piaster equals ten francs, so the military expenditure in the past two years has been 8,000,000,000 francs.</p>
<p>France is spending a large amount of military expenditure on a colony in a corner, because it fears that Japan has designs on this rich tropical colony. Japan has already occupied Nanning in Guangxi Province, which is only twenty-two miles from the border of French Indochina, and only one hundred and sixty-five miles from Hanoi and the northern ports of Haiphong.</p>
<p>What surprised the French even more was that Japan had already occupied Hainan Island and the Paracel Islands. These two military strongholds are only three hundred and thirty miles away from Galong Bay in the north and northeast, where France has built fortifications, aiming to make it France's main naval base. France has also built small naval bases in Haiphong (only one hundred and twenty-five miles from the west coast of Hainan Island) and Saigon, but neither of these places is suitable for warships of 12,000 tons to enter and exit.</p>
<p>Currently, Vietnam may be the weakest link in France's vast colonies. At the same time, in the East, it is believed that if France encounters foreign attacks, it can obtain air and naval assistance from the Singapore naval base.</p>
<p>In June last year, all the military leaders of the French Far East participated in the military conference of the British colonies and autonomous territories in the East. The conference passed a proposal advocating mutual liaison regarding the defense of the British and French territories in the Pacific.</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the European war in September last year, the French Indochina government has passed a new two-year military special tax, hoping to increase 14,000,000 Vietnamese piasters each year, which means that in 1941, it can obtain military expenditure of 280,000,000 francs. In addition, postal fees, property rights and deed registration fees, and all export taxes have been increased. Some items of financial expenditure have even increased taxes by as much as 50%.</p>
<p>In mid-July last year, the French Minister of Colonies, in a report to the President, roughly described Vietnam's new national defense plan. Several items he mentioned: doubling the number of appropriate defense soldiers, a large-scale expansion of the air force plan, including the purchase of fifty aircraft from the Netherlands, and a plan for the industrial development of Vietnam, especially making it an independent unit, without the need to import munitions from France, and developing the aircraft and motor manufacturing industries, and precise plans to fortify Galong Bay.</p>
<p>When the French Minister of Colonies drafted the report, the French Indochina air force only had six squadrons, but since then, it has increased substantially. A French aircraft company called "Rhône-Poulenc" is building a factory that will be able to produce 150 aircraft and 400 motors per year.</p>
<p>According to estimates by the French Minister of Colonies, within one month after the mobilization order, Vietnam can slightly adjust 100,000 trained, well-armed indigenous soldiers to the battlefield. These soldiers will be composed of Annamese, Cambodians, Tonkinese, and other indigenous people. The Annamese had very little ability in the Great War, except for clearing the battlefield and doing hard labor in the rear.</p>
<p>According to French officers, unless there is a French junior officer for every ten indigenous troops, they can avoid collapsing after firing.</p>
<p>Several Vietnamese airfields have been rapidly increased, and the extent of the increase is definitely not due to civilian aviation reasons, and many new military highways are being completed at an accelerated rate. At the beginning of this year, Vietnam already had 21,000 miles of modern highways, one-third of which are asphalt roads.</p>
<p>France does not think that there will be an independence movement among the Vietnamese natives. This is significantly different from the European war from 1914 to 1918, when the Vietnamese took advantage of France's troubles in Europe and attempted to oppose France, resulting in high-pressure policies.</p>
<p>France is easier to deal with in its Far Eastern colonies than Britain. The subjects of British India are involved in the European war, openly refuse to cooperate, and demand independence. The main reason why the Vietnamese are peacefully under French rule is that they believe that getting rid of French rule will inevitably lead to Japanese rule. They would rather be under French rule than Japanese rule.</p>
<p>The current attitude of the Vietnamese towards Japan is obviously different from a few years ago. Previously, the people of French Tonkin believed that Japan was the leader of the Eastern nations to be liberated from the rule of Western European imperialism.</p>
<p>They used to think that a well-intentioned Japan could be relied upon to overthrow French rule and become an independent country. Japanese power was extremely inflated for a period, and Japanese spies cooperated closely with indigenous revolutionary forces.</p>
<p>Japan's actions in China and the exposure of its ambitions for tropical Asian colonies have changed all this. The Vietnamese believe that Japan has no good intentions towards Vietnam or other Asian countries.</p>
<p>The Vietnamese are shocked by the atrocities of the Japanese army in China and believe that Japan's invasion this time is a conquest action. They then realized that joining Japan to expel France would give Japan control from the very beginning.</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the European war, the French had many fears. France was deeply afraid that the natives would rise up in rebellion, so France decided to use military personnel with military power to rule Vietnam. The thoughtful and peaceful approach of Brévié was transferred away, and General Catroux replaced him as Governor-General. France is making the most of Vietnamese manpower and resources for use in the European war.</p>
<p>In order to keep pace with the French government's self-sufficiency plan, the production of agricultural and mineral raw materials that can be used for British and French needs, or can be exported in exchange for foreign exchange, is being intensified. The area of new tea planting is also being expanded. Livestock, leather, rice, and rubber are all listed as items to increase production.</p>
<p>The production of tin and zinc for British and French industries has also increased substantially. The Hongji Company's large amount of anthracite coal has also prepared a large number for the needs of the war.</p>
<p>Detachments of indigenous troops—mainly for sappers and engineering teams—have already been transferred to France, and more than 100,000 new Vietnamese troops are also in progress. French officers declare that a large number of Vietnamese are willing to be volunteers and are already sufficient.</p>
<p>For a superficial observer, the European war seems to have very little impact on Vietnam. Prices have increased slightly because imported goods are scarce, partly due to exchange controls. American cigarettes and British whiskey are difficult to obtain, customs and police patrols are stricter, and people in uniform are more conspicuous. Other than that, the signs of war are not easy to see. Especially away from the urban areas, the lives of the natives are even more unaffected by the European war. (Translated from the Bangkok Times, Hanoi correspondence)</p>
<h3>### Japan and the European War: Evidence Shows the Trend Will Shift with the Defeat of Britain and Germany; Currently Adopting Opportunism; Internally Coveting the Dutch East Indies and Vietnam</h3>
<p>When the European war developed to its highest stage, news of the Chinese war was not widely read in Japan. The Japanese see that this is a life-and-death struggle between one world and another, and they feel very close to the battlefield. They may not participate in the war, but they cannot be unaffected by the outcome of the European war. This is not only a question of what kind of world they will live in, but also of how their future will be affected.</p>
<p>A Japanese told reporters that if Germany wins, Japan will become like Germany. If the democratic countries win, national socialism will be ignored, and Japan will turn from extreme right-wing to a central position.</p>
<p>Japanese public opinion is formally neutral, but emotionally pro-German. The press is unanimously sympathetic to Finland for the Soviet Union's aggression, but has no sympathy for Norway, Finland, or Belgium. Right-wing newspapers, such as the Hochi Shimbun and the Kokumin Shimbun, hope that Germany will triumph and then create a new era based on national socialism.</p>
<p>Among the Japanese, there are also a small number of expatriates who sympathize with Britain and France. In Japan's profitable commerce, 80% of every US dollar is transacted with the United States and the British Empire, and most businessmen praise Britain and the United States. In addition, there are most of the older generation of educators and Japanese Christians, who also belong to this category.</p>
<p>At the other extreme are the sympathizers of the National Socialist Party and the Fascist Party, although few in number, but powerful. They are all young officers and bureaucrats. Among the people, all the young people who join patriotic organizations hope for Germany's victory.</p>
<p>The whole country believes that the diplomatic path followed by Japanese Foreign Minister Arita in the conflicts of the empires is regular. He believes that the future world will become a new type, no longer a free individualistic civilization, allowing all small countries to have legal and political equality and coexistence.</p>
<p>This new world will become a combination of vast areas, each group centered on a powerful country. The Americas will form such a group under the United States of America, East Asia must be placed under Japanese hegemony, and Central Europe must be controlled by Germany. The Soviet Union itself is large enough to form two units. Britain and France believe that there is still enough to exist, although their empires will inevitably shrink.</p>
<p>Japan's national policy is opportunistic in method and extremely clear and simple in principle. Its purpose is to make Japan the leader of East Asia, that is, in addition to the "new order" in China, to create a Monroe Doctrine in the Western Pacific, without foreign colonies within Japan's sphere of influence.</p>
<p>The Dutch East Indies is very backward in autonomy. If the Netherlands loses these colonies, Japan will claim to be its protector. It is extremely jealous of small countries having such rich colonies. Japan's policy of economic aggression can run rampant and can wait for the opportunity to move.</p>
<p>What Japan is most concerned about in the Dutch East Indies is the safe supply of oil, rubber, and tin, which are essential for several wars and industries. It is somewhat excessive to prohibit the Dutch from using their own production for their own defense. But the Netherlands has no way to go, so it has to cater to Japan's will, and Britain and France agree.</p>
<p>What is a mystery is the attitude of the Soviet Union. After Germany's defeat, will the Soviet Union concentrate its forces to deal with Japan? After Hitler's victory, will the Soviet Union be dragged into the German regional empire, eventually making Japan feel a greater danger than communism? Those are all "perhaps" questions. At present, Japan is expanding its army, expanding its fortification zone, and starting to enlist soldiers in Manchuria, preparing for the unknown situation in the future.

<p>Ladies and gentlemen, the Sino-German Cultural Association has had a history of five years. During these five years, the whole world has been shrouded in the clouds of war, and the East and the West are full of flames of war. In such an environment, we are still able to promote cultural work, which is really gratifying. And we are holding the fifth annual meeting of the Sino-German Cultural Association today, which is especially special and important. The whole world is living in war, which is the misfortune of mankind and the misfortune of the cultural world. China has been fighting alone for three years to protect the independence of the country and the survival of the nation. China has also done its utmost to maintain its culture, that is, to maintain the vanguard of human culture, and to fight to the death with the Japanese warlords who are engaged in destroying culture. China has already done its utmost to bear the burden and has made great contributions to the world. Before the Japanese warlords have completely realized that they should withdraw from Chinese territory and have not realized the greatness and inviolability of Chinese culture, the Chinese people will unite to overthrow this public enemy of culture. China's response is unchanged. The belief of the Chinese people is as firm as steel. Now, unfortunately, the war is proceeding rapidly, and the damage to human culture is huge and unimaginable. All those engaged in cultural work in the world are saddened and regretful. War is like a contagious disease. When the September 18 Incident occurred, China announced to the world that this was the beginning of a great disaster for the world. At that time, the United States realized the seriousness of the situation and proposed to jointly put it out, but unfortunately it was understood by various countries, resulting in today. The war will not stop and will burn itself. We sincerely hope that the European war will not expand and will end as soon as possible, because without peace and order, no culture will be carried forward. Everyone should preserve their vitality and seek timely peace on the basis of their achievements. The spread and prolongation of the European war will inevitably lead to mutual destruction, or even the destruction of human culture. The genius and intelligence specially endowed by the German nation, its contribution to culture, is admired by everyone. We hope that the German nation can make greater contributions to human culture and make great efforts to lay the foundation for world peace. After the last World War, President Wilson's peace proposals were to the point, but unfortunately the peace mechanisms that emerged later still harbored hatred, resulting in crises everywhere and finally wars following each other, without a single peaceful day. Our Premier Sun also earnestly advised all countries to jointly help China build and develop its inexhaustible resources, in order to resolve the economic contradictions between countries after the war and eliminate the factors of future wars, but this suggestion was not valued by politicians in various countries. Although this matter is separated by twenty years, we believe that it is still the great way to seek world peace. We would like to especially call the attention of German politicians to this. Sino-German culture has had more and more contact and closer relations since the 17th century, and especially now. The communication and promotion of culture between the two countries is closely related to the establishment of world peace. We deeply hope that the people of China and Germany will shoulder the common mission and successfully allocate it.</p>
<p>Declaration issued by the conference</p>
<p>The declaration of the conference said that the mission of the Sino-German Cultural Association is to communicate the culture of China and Germany, to make it flourish, and to promote the friendship between the two countries, to make it more and more harmonious. In recent years, the evolution of the international situation has affected the Far East, but this has not hindered the promotion of Sino-German cultural work in the slightest. China's war of resistance has entered the fourth era. What China seeks is to preserve the independence and freedom of the country, and to maintain the work of equality and mutual benefit between countries. Therefore, the war of resistance and national construction are carried out at the same time. The foundation of its will is firm, and the clarity of its position has long been celebrated by the world. Now that the European war is in full swing, we Chinese people, in addition to moving forward with a consistent belief, we believe that Germany in its current state should seize a good opportunity to realize a just and impartial peace, so as to devote itself to the promotion of world culture, and the German nation with its innate intelligence has made greater contributions in academia. Japan has been a scourge to the Far East for decades. Its painstaking efforts are to seek the realization of the so-called "New Order in East Asia." In other words, it is to exclude the rights and interests of other countries in East Asia and attempt to monopolize them. China's heroic war of resistance has revealed and shattered Japan's poisonous plots layer by layer and step by step. In view of this silent war, Japan obviously wants to take advantage of the opportunity to move, in order to fulfill its intention of taking advantage of the fire. If Japan gets its wish, it will not only be a misfortune for East Asia, but also a misfortune for Germany. Germany has its long-standing historical position in East Asia, its economic, commercial, and cultural close relations. If the East Asia door is indeed closed by Japan, then all European and American countries will be excluded, and Germany will certainly not be an exception. Japan's anti-German behavior in the Far East during the last World War can serve as a lesson. Moreover, the result of Japan's war of aggression against China has become the end of a crossbow, and it is neither a so-called stable force in East Asia, nor can it play a decisive role in the international arena or help to reverse any situation. We firmly believe that the authorities in Germany should not be confused by Japan and repeat the previous mistakes. If the Pacific War breaks out unfortunately, the prolongation of the European War and the reversal of the situation are expected, and the future of world peace is even more distant and hopeless. Regarding the above points, we dare to hold them up to arouse the attention of the German people. The German authorities also have the necessity to reconsider their foreign policy towards the Far East at this time in terms of the situation and the reason. The regenerating China sincerely accepts the cooperation from friendly countries. We deeply hope that Germany can weigh the pros and cons in the Far East in time and determine its choice, and especially hope that Sino-German relations will have a new era unfolding. We will do our best to strive for it.</p>

<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no change in HSBC's listed rates. Although news from Europe could have affected the market, the impact of positive and negative news varied depending on the operator. The range of fluctuations was narrow.

<h3>Conflicting News from Europe - The Gold Market Not Greatly Stimulated - Varying Motivations for Buying and Selling</h3>
<p>Yesterday's black market for cash gold lingered in a state of hesitation. Operators were not stimulated by the changes in Europe. There is no impact at present, and further developments are awaited. Trading was still active throughout the day, but the fluctuations, although tortuous, were not huge. The morning opening was 5,580 yuan. After a certain gold company vigorously absorbed it and money changers purchased it, it rose to 5,640 yuan. Later, securities firms, cash houses, and retail investors started a selling spree, and it once fell back to 5,540 yuan. Afterwards, money changers, a certain gold company, and silver houses took advantage of the low price to buy in. At the same time, the foreign exchange market was tight, causing the price to rise again to 5,670 yuan. The afternoon closed down by 100 yuan. The market was initially weak. Silver houses sold the most. However, it was heard that the foreign exchange market was still slightly tight, and buyers were excited, raising the price to 5,625 yuan. The closing price was still 5,590 yuan, an increase of 15 yuan compared with the closing price of the night before yesterday. The total transaction volume was more than 3,000 taels. Jewelry gold was initially priced high but ended up flat. Customs gold, etc., remained flat.</p>
<p>Cash Gold Rises by 15 Yuan</p>
<p>Since the morning, each bar (10 taels), initially with a stable exchange rate, slightly increased by 5 yuan at the opening. Money changers entered silver houses at 5,580 yuan. Then, due to the selling by the gold and silver houses, a certain money changer lacked buying power, and it fell by 20 yuan. Gold houses sold securities to the amount of 10 taels, lower than 5,560 yuan. Suddenly, the foreign exchange market tightened, and buying interest soared. Gold houses, money changers, and silver houses competed to absorb. Soon, it soared by 80 yuan. Silver houses traded 20 taels with each other at 5,640 yuan. Later, as buyers decreased, securities firms suddenly sold, and cash houses also sold one after another. Before long, it was strongly suppressed by 100 yuan. Securities firms sold money changers 10 taels, falling back to 5,540 yuan. Subsequently, as the foreign exchange market remained soft and retail selling had subsided, coupled with the gold and silver houses competing to absorb, the price leaped by 130 yuan again. Securities firms sold silver houses 30 taels for 5,670 yuan. At noon, the buyers turned less, and the exchange market suddenly reported a rebound, causing retail investors to spit out. It entered the 5,600 yuan level. Securities firms sold gold houses 20 taels for 5,570 yuan as the afternoon closing price. When the afternoon opened, the silver houses competed to sell to each other. The opening price fell by 5 yuan, and the silver houses traded 10 taels with each other for 5,565 yuan. Later, due to the scarcity of buyers, it fell by 25 yuan again. A certain silver house sold securities firms 50 taels for 5,540 yuan. Then, as sellers gradually decreased and retail investors took the opportunity to buy at low prices, the market suddenly turned around and rose by 30 to 40 yuan. Later, a certain silver house strongly entered more than 200 taels, and the price exited the 5,600 yuan level. Silver houses traded 30 taels with each other for 5,625 yuan. After entering, a certain silver house stopped buying and waited and watched, while a certain money changer tended to sell, and the price could not be supported and fell. Silver houses traded 20 taels with each other for 5,590 yuan, as the evening closing price. The result was an increase of 15 yuan compared to the previous day. The whole day fluctuated by 130 yuan. The selling price of the cash gold house's own brand of gold was more than 10 yuan higher than the cash gold, and the purchase was 30 yuan lower. The current marked gold was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold. There was little trading.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Tried to Rise But Stopped</p>
<p>At first, Datonghhang still set the price of jewelry gold at 570 taels per liang. It was raised by 10 yuan at 10 o'clock and fell back by 10 yuan at noon. There were no changes after that. The result was half flat. Datonghhang still set the price at 570 yuan. The new price was the same as the old price. The purchase price was reduced by about 30 yuan.</p>
<h3>The Foreign Currency Market Hesitates</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market showed a gradual consolidation trend. The British and American gold pounds also fluctuated, and eventually rose slightly by 1 yuan. The supply and demand of surplus British notes was still even, and the market price was stable. The US dollar notes initially rose to 17 yuan, but then retreated to 16 yuan and 6 jiao and a half, and finally to 16 yuan and 8 jiao, an increase of 2 jiao compared with the previous day. The supply of Hong Kong notes was strong, and the market price was slightly softer. The demand for Annam notes gradually increased, and the market price rose. There was no shortage of Japanese gold notes. The evening market fell back to 1 yuan and 8 fen. There was a slight need for Korean notes, and the market price rose slightly. The evening market was 9 jiao 4 fen and a half.</p>
<h3>Nanjing Bank Closes</h3>
<p>There were rumors in the market about the instability of the Nanjing Commercial Savings Bank in this city. The bank closed yesterday. The Banking Industry Joint Reserve Committee sent a circular to the clearing banks at 9:30 a.m., stating that the Nanjing Bank's clearing deposit balance on the 17th was insufficient to cover the amount payable. It has not been supplemented so far. According to the regulations, the bank's clearing relationship on the 17th has been revoked. All notes receivable and payable relating to the bank should be returned to each other. From today onwards, the clearing relationship will be temporarily suspended.</p>
<h3>World Silver Prices Plummet</h3>
<p>London, 17th Cable: The recent silver market plummeted by 4.375 due to mass selling. The supply of far-month contracts was limited, so it was slightly less than 1.25. There were few buyers and few transactions. The market was flat. The market was still flat after closing. In addition, New York Cable: The American silver price for spot was slightly less than 0.25. The Indian silver suddenly fell by three rupees and three annas, all retreating to fifty-nine rupees and twelve annas. The market was soft and tired. A total of two hundred transaction orders were made.</p>
<h3>Securities - Domestic Debt Rises and Fluctuates - Most Foreign Stocks are Scalping</h3>
<p>After falling for two days, the securities black market rose again. People in the market believe that the resolution of the European war may bring peace to China and Japan. This ideal speculation does not understand the true meaning of China's resistance against Japan. It is like a dream. In fact, the market price rebounded due to the recovery of Yichang, and the war was going smoothly. The market price may not soar immediately, but it is not easy to fall. Yesterday, the most sought-after stocks were Shuntai and No. 20. The rest were No. 11 and Lianyi covering shorts, but Lianyi sold again in the afternoon. Hongkang sold the most throughout the day. Yichang, Jiufeng, and No. 4 also sold. If there are no major changes in the future situation, the sluggish market should not change. Yesterday's market price improved by 2 jiao and a half to 4 jiao and a half. The total turnover was more than 600,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock trading: 60 shares of Bank of Communications were traded at a price of 65 yuan.</p>
<p>What is worth noting in yesterday's stock market at the Public Chamber of Commerce is Jardine Matheson shares. When the market opened on Monday, it was priced at 30 yuan, and yesterday's highest price reached 39.25 yuan. The final price was 30 yuan. The ups and downs of British Union shares were also extreme. Although the profit prospects of rubber shares are very good (probably from 30% to 50%), the price reaction is still based on all the huge transactions on Monday and Tuesday, and it is not known how many of them are genuine investment transactions and how many are "scalping" transactions.</p>
<p>London, 17th (Week 10) Cable: Today's listed market price of Chinese foreign debt is still stable. There were no changes in the upper and lower bonds.</p>
<p>London, 17th (Monday) Cable: Today's listed market price of British Far East company stocks is still stable. Only Gulagram Rubber shares fell by 7.5 pence to 15 shillings. There were bids but no offers, and the rest were unchanged.</p>
<h3>Food - After the Rice Price Shockingly High - Yesterday it Fell Slightly by 1-2 Yuan</h3>
<p>The rice market has been constantly changing recently. The magnitude of the fluctuations often exceeds people's expectations. This rise was particularly drastic. The black market price of japonica rice actually reached 70 yuan, and the price of foreign rice reached 60 yuan. In half a month, it suddenly rose by more than 10 yuan. This is truly unprecedented. When the market opened yesterday morning, not only was the route blocked, but most people stood by and watched. The sellers seemed to feel the pain of being unable to sell. This was due to the price being too high and the price of rice in the mainland being flat. Transportation was no longer profitable. At the same time, it was close to the price of foreign rice. The order volume was very large, and a large number of goods would flood in soon. The general speculators' rumors were self-defeating and lost their support. Zhejiang, Ningbo, and Shaoxing groups directly ordered foreign rice. With these relationships, they urgently sought to sell. The general trend was over, and it was difficult to save people's hearts. No matter how much you shouted, most people turned a deaf ear. It went all the way down, with a slight turn at the end. The market quotation for foreign rice, Saigon No. 1, was 56.5 yuan, Huowen 56 yuan, Xiaojiao 54 yuan, Tokyo Yangjian 54.5-54 yuan, mixed broken 50 yuan, 48-49 yuan, and rice tea 51 yuan. Statistics show that the prices of each were sharply lower by about 2 yuan compared to the market price on the morning of the previous day. In the afternoon, the Vietnam issue once rebounded, but in the end, due to the lack of actual sales, the floating households continued to sell. The market price rose and fell again, and the result was another decline of 2 to 3 jiao in the afternoon closing price. New transactions have not been finalized, and it is feared that they will be blocked, so no orders have been placed, and the return of goods is also less than 1 yuan. Saigon No. 2 in late June and early July initially opened at 62.5 yuan, then to 63 yuan. The same number 2 of Roma rice was at 62.5 yuan, a total of more than 200 tons of transactions. There are currently fewer than 6,000 bags of foreign rice.</p>
<p>A large batch of foreign rice arrived in Shanghai yesterday. It was transported from Hong Kong by the Yihua Shipping Company's Pangshenglun, totaling 20,752 bags. It was docked at the Roosevelt Wharf in the French Concession to unload. It is heard that 3,000 bags will be transported to Fujian today.</p>
<p>Although the arrival of thick and thin japonica rice was still limited, only over a thousand bags, it was rumored that someone saw that Shanghai rice was expensive and had great profits to be made, so they planned to search for a large amount in the producing area and transport it to Shanghai. The gate price fell sharply by 2 yuan accordingly. Changbang special clean japonica rice was 66-67 yuan, Su Kun Changzhou white japonica rice was 65-66 yuan, Qingsi special thin was 66 yuan, and Nangang rate rice was as high as 64.5 yuan, then down to 62.5 yuan.</p>
<h3>Flour Sales in Southeast Asia</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market for No. 2 flour was unchanged. Due to the high price of rice everywhere, the need for flour has increased unabated. In terms of customer sales, new transactions from Southeast Asian customers were also frequent. The customer price for brands such as Tianzhu was 16.25 yuan, but the price of returned goods was slightly different due to competitive relations. It is estimated that the total number of flour transactions in the market was more than 20,000 bags. The supply and demand of old car brand returned goods and miscellaneous brands of flour from the mainland were both silent, and there was no formal market. There was also no formal market for wheat. Today, 35,000 bags of flour will be transported to Guangdong and 1,500 bags to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>In addition, 1,010 bags of beans will be transported to Hong Kong, 150 bags to Singapore, 4,000 pieces of bean cake to Fujian, 2,910 pieces to Hong Kong, and 200 bags of sesame to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton - Rumors are Bearish - Cotton Yarn Falls</h3>
<p>The yarn market is weakening, and the downward trend has started again. This is because France's order to Germany not to cease fire has been interpreted as a sign of peace. As a result, people's hearts have become weaker again. At the same time, the overseas cotton market is also trending downward, so the selling pressure is slightly heavier, and the market has fallen again. However, the purchase of 10-count coarse yarn in the South China region is still ongoing, which is very beneficial.</p>
<p>The spot yarn market opened in the morning. Because the market was tight and prices were high on the previous day, many people shouted high prices. The opening price of 20-count Double Horse was 1,200 yuan, and 10 bags were traded. Among them, there may be improprieties. A double room was 1,175 yuan, and it fell straight to 1,140 yuan. Then, it was heard that the foreign exchange rate was loose and then tight, and it rose to 1,165 yuan again, but major investors still had no intention of taking positions. The market is falling again, and there are many rumors, mostly in favor of the shorts. The closing price was 1,146 yuan. It is found that the total transaction volume in half a day was 1,763 bags, and the 20-count Double Horse fell by 23 yuan. Today, 525 pieces of yarn will be transported to Hong Kong, 1,285 pieces to Guangzhou Bay, 90 pieces to Haimen, and 40 pieces to Haiphong. The amount of yarn bought by various guilds is listed on the left.</p>
<h3>American and Indian Cotton Fall Back - Local Cotton Transactions are Quiet</h3>
<p>Local cotton transactions are as calm as ever. This is because there are no new developments in the yarn market. It is said that American cotton has fallen again by more than 20 pounds, and Indian cotton is also lifeless. Therefore, the factories' buying is very slow, and the market is not very excited. However, occasional business is all because the Indian cotton market is quite weak.</p>
<p>Another message: New York cotton market: At the beginning of the morning, the market opened and fell due to speculators selling. Later, due to the news from France and the closing of some bulls, the closing price was 20 pounds lower than the previous day. The Indian cotton market fell by four rupees yesterday along with the forecast.</p>
<p>The Shanghai foreign cotton transaction has gradually improved recently, but the number of transactions is not large. The industry's concerns are quite firm. The general opinion is that cotton prices have gradually turned around.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods - Increased Sales of Cloth in Guerrilla Areas</h3>
<p>The cloth market rebounded after the fall, which is due to the good prospects of the cloth price. Fellow traders and Ronghu gradually started buying, and the actual digestion also increased. Goods such as Fushi fine twill and Zhenzhong fine cloth were 2.5 to 5 jiao higher per piece than the previous day. The market for the rest of the goods was stable, only the sales of summer cloth were sluggish, and the selling price was lower. Recently, the needs of guerrilla areas such as Hangzhou, Danghu, and Dinghai have increased suddenly. It is heard that most of them are transferred to the mainland. Yesterday, 200 pieces of white goods, bleached and dyed cloths were traded on this street, nearly 100 pieces of coarse cloth and colored cloth were traded by the Zhejiang and Anhui guilds, 140 to 150 pieces of colored cloth, woolen cloth, and printed cloth were traded by the Beilu Yanjin guild, and 50 to 60 bales of New Twill and coarse cloth were traded by the Hong Kong guild.</p>
<p>Dongbu's biggest rise at noon returned, Longtou fine cloth was seen higher than 35.5 yuan but ended up falling due to ordinary actual sales. The subsequent market fell to 34.9 yuan. 400 to 500 pieces of spot and forward fine cloth were traded by the local street and Northern guilds.</p>
<p>170 pieces of piece goods were transported to Tianjin on the 19th, 272 pieces to Guangzhou Bay, 91 pieces to Haiphong, 80 pieces to Haikou, and 15 pieces to Singapore.</p>
<h3>Sales of Xiacuxi Wool are Strong - 150 Yuan Per Suit</h3>
<p>Since the prevalence of Xiacuxi wool in 1927, its sales have been even more popular this summer, and its orders are also more than other woolens. Most of the wholesalers have samples. Many of the high-end wholesalers also sell it. High-end wholesalers mostly sell 7-8 yuan per yard of Donghuo, and wholesale cargo mostly sells 20 yuan per yard of American goods. The quality of American goods is good and the price is high. The Western clothing merchants buy and cut it after the guests designate it. The price of Donghuo is cheap, and ordinary business is more prosperous. The colors are pure white, light yellow, dark yellow, cyan gray, light lilac, etc. The actual sales of yellow-gray and white are the most popular. This kind of clothing material is only 40 inches wide. Therefore, a suit of Xiacuxi wool that sells for more than 20 yuan per yard costs about 150 yuan in legal tender.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market - Coarse and White Sugar Continue to Loosen</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market continued to decline due to excessive sales by scattered households. The guild's price, the spot price of 24 coarse white sugar was 70.3 yuan to 70 yuan per bag at the local warehouse, 70 yuan to 69.8 yuan per bag at the foreign warehouse, and 55.6 yuan to 55.4 yuan for re-exported goods in the morning, and 55.2 yuan to 55 yuan in the afternoon. One yuan less. Taikoo B Mark new cargo was 81.5 yuan, and 5 jiao less. The price of H Mark Red was 58 yuan, and the price of Dutch Red was still 59.6 yuan. The price of the local factory's snow white was 70.5 yuan, No. 1 ice was 91.5 yuan, and Jingming ice was 93 yuan. Liu Sugar only opened 50 to 60 bags of Diaoging (transported by Taikoo), which was still 63.5 yuan. In addition, the asking price for chemical sugar was too high, and there were no transactions.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea - Inland Transportation is Blocked - Silk Prices Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday's silk market did not see much glory or disgrace abroad. The recent rise in New York was half a point, and the far-month drop was three points. Yokohama's spot market was 20 yuan less, and this period was 16 yuan less. Due to the temporary inability to transport to Shanghai in the mainland, silk prices rose. Due to replenishment transactions in Renji and other firms, the asking price for spot white factory has risen to 5,200 yuan, but the spot market in Shanghai is limited, resulting in very few transactions. The market situation is very firm.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods - Red Dates Suddenly Rise by 9 Yuan</h3>
<p>Due to the recent shortage of dates, the market has suddenly tightened. It was found that the previous market opened at 26 yuan, and yesterday a few dozen bags opened as high as 36 yuan in cash, an increase of as much as 9 yuan. This shows the scarcity.</p>
<h3>Hardware - Cement Market is Firm</h3>
<p>The spot cement circulating on the market recently feels rather scarce. Although the building groups on this street do not see much use, cement still has a feeling of demand exceeding supply. The reason is that the source of cement is blocked and it is a military necessity. Transportation to Shanghai is difficult. Those who trade this commodity are eager to keep prices high and are unwilling to sell at low prices. Therefore, the current market is still firm. If white cement sells for 105 yuan per barrel, Matou is 55 yuan, and bagged goods are asking for 16 yuan per bag, which is no different from the golden age of the previous market.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Wenzhou Boxboard and Native Paper Arrive</h3>
<p>Since the supply of sanitary paper and rough (raw) paper from Fuyang has become difficult, it has been replaced by Wenzhou's Size 46 screen paper, which is sold on the market and has a wide reach. This paper was originally only used for making paper money in various northern regions, but now there is an additional source of income. Yesterday, 7,000 pieces were shipped from Wenzhou. Boxboard is also mostly from Wenzhou, and has often soared in price due to supply disruptions. Yesterday, 7,000 pieces were also shipped from Wenzhou. (Group)</p>

<h3>French Armistice Does Not Affect the Shanghai Situation Many Rumors Have No Factual Proof Consul General Eugene Makes a Firm Statement</h3>
<p>The status of the Shanghai concessions is subject to unavoidable influences and fluctuations whenever international situations change, due to its intricate and complex international relations, causing unnecessary anxiety and the spread of rumors. However, the actual situation is often not as such. Since the news of the French armistice reached Shanghai yesterday, it has inevitably shocked the world. In fact, all the rumors are baseless and unreliable. It is difficult to predict how the European situation will evolve in the short term. As for the Far East, it is true that Japan's ambitions have become more intense due to the sudden changes in the European situation. However, the international relations in the South Pacific are extremely complex, and Japan may not act rashly without considering everything. As for the Shanghai concessions, there will be no changes in the near future. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Japanese Military Exercises Not Surprising</p>
<p>The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury" reported that after the news of France's surrender to Germany, Japanese military police and tanks conducted exercises in the Nanshi (Chinese) area last night (17th) and this morning (18th). Rumors that 3,000 Wang Jingwei's soldiers had arrived in Shanghai caused anxiety among foreign and Chinese business circles in the city. The Chamber of Commerce showed a peculiar reaction today. The market opened firm, rising slightly, then falling back, and then rising again. It is believed that this was due to the rumor that the Wang regime would issue new currency within a few days.</p>
<p>French Consul General Makes a Solemn Statement</p>
<p>French Consul General Eugene told reporters this morning that the current status of the French Concession in Shanghai will continue to be maintained. Regarding the various rumors circulating this morning, Eugene dismissed them as unfounded rumors, saying, "As long as we are alive, we must work. We are not sad. All affairs in the French Concession, including the police, will continue as before. Let the rumors fly; we will not be moved by them. We are still standing on the land, not sleeping in it."</p>
<p>Various Rumors Unconfirmed</p>
<p>Regarding the Japanese military police and tank exercises in Nanshi, no explanation was given today. Several people witnessed the exercises, but the city authorities could not explain them. It is believed that these exercises are the same as those previously held in Hongkou and are now being held in Nanshi for some special reason. The rumor that 3,000 Wang Jingwei's soldiers had arrived in Shanghai and were gathering around the city could not be fully confirmed.</p>
<p>US Marines Return to Shanghai</p>
<p>In addition, 200 US Fourth Marine Regiment soldiers stationed in Shanghai returned to Shanghai yesterday aboard the US ship "Bittern" after completing training in Qinhuangdao. It is said that these soldiers were ordered to return to Shanghai after Italy declared war to strengthen the US military presence in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Japanese Spokesman's Statement</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Japanese Embassy in Shanghai told Western reporters that France's submission to the German army would not cause the Japanese authorities to take drastic changes to the situation in the city. Japan's policy of non-intervention in the European war does not consider controlling the British and French concessions, unless the two concessions "disturb the peace" or "hinder Japan's plan to build a new order in East Asia." Japan has previously made many demands on the two concessions, some of which have not been met. But at present, the relationship between the concession authorities and Japanese military officers is quite friendly. Regarding the presence of troops from belligerent countries in the concession, the spokesman said that Mayor Fu's request for the withdrawal of these troops was very reasonable according to international law, and that the existence of these troops could easily cause "unintentional incidents" and force Japan to take action to maintain "peace" and "order." He also said that the Japanese authorities pay close attention to various Chinese and English newspapers in the city, and that the Japanese authorities are very dissatisfied with some of them and are closely monitoring them. The spokesman also said that Japan is engaged in a large-scale war, and the natural desires of the Japanese people must be satisfied. Foreigners who oppose Japan's actions do not understand the facts. However, Japan does not want to take advantage of the changes in Europe to obtain the interests of foreigners in China. The Japanese slogan is "non-intervention in the European war." The Japanese believe that Europe belongs to the Europeans, America belongs to the Americans, and the East belongs to the Easterners. The spokesman concluded by saying that the Japanese did not view France's submission as surprising, as they had long anticipated this day. The Japanese knew about the weapons used by the German army because they had close contact with them.</p>
<p>Peaceful Situation in Western Shanghai</p>
<p>Yesterday, there were also rumors that Japanese military police had joined the "Great Way Police Department" in the extra-settlement roads area around the French Concession to strengthen their strength. A reporter toured the extra-settlement roads area for a week yesterday afternoon and proved that the rumors were not true. Japanese military police could only be seen in the "Shanghai Municipal Government." During the reporter's tour, he only saw a Japanese military officer leading several "Great Way Police" officers patrolling the road on Haig Road. Nothing else was seen.</p>
<p>Financial Markets Relatively Stable</p>
<p>Yesterday, the markets were inevitably stimulated by the many rumors, but were generally stable. Speculators were also cautious and did not dare to act rashly. Although the price of the British pound fell sharply at one point yesterday morning due to news from Europe, it quickly rebounded due to limited supply and purchases by Japanese banks. The British pound opened at $3.60 and closed at $3.65. However, the French franc has been completely suspended since it effectively stopped trading last Friday. The exchange rate posted by HSBC remained unchanged. The black market was tight for British pounds and US dollars. In addition, there was little activity in the gold standard, yarn, and miscellaneous grain markets, indicating stability.</p>
<h3>Inability to Advance South Due to the Situation</h3>
<p>After the sudden turn of events in the European war, the situation in the Pacific suddenly became tense. It is reported that Vice Admiral Tanaka, Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Fleet in China, recently inspected Hainan Island. He reviewed the troops stationed in the northern part of Hainan Island and the situation on the front lines a few days ago. In fact, he had another special mission related to Japan's southward advance policy. Not long ago, people in Tokyo observed that if France makes peace, Japan's policy toward French Indochina will become more active.</p>
<p>Serious Attention to Japan's Actions</p>
<p>According to an observation by a senior British diplomatic official, Japan does have this intention, but is hesitant because it fears the firm attitude of the United States. At the same time, American observers stated that the US authorities are extremely determined to maintain the status quo in the Pacific, as evidenced by measures such as permanently concentrating the fleet in Honolulu and not participating in the European war. The US authorities are closely monitoring Japan's actions. If Japan takes action in the South Pacific, the United States will not only force Japan to submit through economic sanctions, but also use its huge air power to crush the island nation.</p>
<p>American Air Force's Tremendous Power</p>
<p>According to recent statistics, the United States has as many as 8,500 fighter jets, and its air bases are located from the Arctic to the tropics. Even in terms of civilian airline pilots, the number has increased to 10,000 in one year. At the same time, it has 39 "Flying Fortresses," and will have 175 in June 1941. Although the number is small, no country in the world can compete with the United States. This type of "Flying Fortress" can fly 3,200 miles round trip. The US Air Force stationed in Honolulu can fly to Tokyo, bomb it, and return directly to its base, or fly from the Atlantic base to bomb Saarbrücken, Germany, without any difficulty. The power of the American air force is evident from this.</p>
<h3>Please Assist All Industries: Disaster Relief in Shaoxing Area, Industry Associations Suggest Unified Relief Efforts in Ningbo and Shaoxing</h3>
<p>Since the Ningbo and Shaoxing native place associations separately organized fundraising committees, they have begun raising funds and purchasing large quantities of foreign rice to transport for relief. Various industry associations have also mobilized fundraising to relieve the famine in Ningbo and Shaoxing. According to the New Voice News Agency, various industry associations, considering that the individual fundraising efforts of the Ningbo and Shaoxing native place associations are relatively weak, suggest joint action for greater effectiveness. They have suggested that the two native place associations unify their operations and provide widespread relief.</p>
<p>Expand Fundraising</p>
<p>The Shaoxing natives in Shanghai association has specially distributed letters to various industry associations in the city, stating that the rice shortage is severe, with each stone rising to 120 yuan. People have exhausted chaff and bran, and are now tasting grass roots and tree bark. Children are being abandoned, and the roads are filled with corpses. In addition, the weather is extremely dry, and half of the farmland has not been planted. It is predicted that the autumn harvest will be much worse. They have launched an expanded fundraising campaign for price stabilization in Shaoxing to assist the price stabilization groups in various counties and seek relief for the entire Shaoxing rice supply. They implore people to remember the millions of hungry people in Shaoxing waiting to be fed and widely appeal for large donations so that those on the verge of death can be reborn. The association has now decided that once the donated funds have reached a certain amount, it will purchase rice for price stabilization in the areas where it is most urgently needed. They hope that various native place associations will actively contribute.</p>
<p>Meeting and Consultation</p>
<p>Since the Ningbo natives in Shanghai association initiated fundraising for the rice shortage in their hometown, fellow villagers from various industries have actively contributed. The metal industry villagers have contributed the most, reaching more than 80,000 yuan. Other industries are also very enthusiastic and often exceed the expected amount after the fundraising campaign is launched. The association has scheduled a general meeting on the 22nd of this month to discuss various relief efforts and issued notices to various industry associations yesterday.</p>
<p>Disaster Situation Continued Report</p>
<p>The Ningbo natives in Shanghai association received a letter yesterday from the heads of various villages in the Dongqian Lake area of Yin County, stating that the residents of the Dongqian Lake area of Yin County have traditionally made a living by fishing. Recently, the lake has dried up, and fishing boats are stranded in the lake and cannot sail out to sea. They are helpless. At this time of severe rice shortage, people are starving to death every day. Please provide relief quickly. In addition, the mountain area of Yinjiang Bridge in Yin County has no water and does not produce grain. It has been planting fritillaria bulbs. Since the rice shortage, grain has not been supplied, and the supply has been cut off for ten days. The residents are crying out in hunger, and corpses are lying all over the road, which is unbearable to witness. They have also requested the association to find ways to provide relief.</p>
<h3>Letters to Europe Returned in Batches Due to Fighting in Delivery Areas, European Liners Scheduled to Depart Regularly</h3>
<p>According to news from the Postal Administration, since the outbreak of war in Europe, many letters from this port to various European countries have been undeliverable due to fighting in the delivery areas. Several batches have now been returned to Shanghai. The areas where delivery is impossible are mostly the Netherlands, Norway, Belgium, and Germany. The main types of mail are letters.</p>
<p>According to the reporters of Pingming News Agency, the liners departing from this port to various European countries this month are: the Teheran of the British Company after the 20th, the Precious Tree Cloud of the Royal Company after the 24th, the President Coolidge of the United States after the 27th, and the French postal ship Felix Roussel at the end of the month.</p>
<h3>Crackdown on Rice Adulteration, Hoarders Sold Off Yesterday, Rice Prices Fell</h3>
<p>Amidst the soaring rice prices, some unscrupulous rice merchants are actually adulterating high-quality rice with inferior goods for sale, deceiving citizens and disregarding commercial ethics. Although the authorities have repeatedly issued notices and strictly cracked down, they have achieved considerable results for a time. Today, as rice prices continue to reach new highs and food panic has not been eliminated, some speculative rice merchants have once again come up with the idea of resuming rice adulteration. The authorities have made up their minds to take action and are closely monitoring the situation. Once verified, they will be severely punished to deter others and assist in the crackdown. Yesterday, the rice market saw a drop in prices due to speculators’ reckless price increases in recent days, with each stone of rice reaching as high as 60 yuan, causing buyers to hesitate. Hoarders, seeing the potential for profit, competed to sell off their stocks. In addition to the large quantities of Saigon foreign rice arriving in Shanghai in recent days, the Beijing-Shanghai Railway has also been transporting thousands of stones of domestic rice every day. Farmers in the suburbs have also been carrying and transporting rice to the city for sale, amounting to about 3,000 stones per day. Yesterday, foreign rice and domestic rice both fell by about one yuan. However, some speculators are still trying to stir up trouble.</p>
<h3>Land Bureau Archives and Maps, Consular Body Refuses to Hand Over, Should Be Returned to the Legitimate Chinese Government, Fu Xiaoan Threatens to Declare Invalid</h3>
<p>The English-language "Greater Shanghai Evening Post" reported that this morning (the 18th), it was heard from reliable sources that the Shanghai Consular Body is divided on the issue of handing over 312 boxes of archives and maps of the Shanghai Municipal Government Land Bureau to "Mayor" Fu Xiaoan. Several consuls in Shanghai oppose handing over the archives because they believe the time is not yet ripe. According to their consular officials, Fu must still show his willingness to cooperate with the authorities of the Public Concession. For example, an agreement on the issue of roads outside the boundary has not yet reached a preliminary solution, that is, the establishment of the Western District Joint Police Force. As for the Public Concession Bureau, which currently holds the archives, it has not yet formally received notice of the disagreement among the consuls. The Public Concession Bureau asked the consular office at the beginning of this year for instructions on what action to take. Some consuls ordered the Public Concession Bureau to keep the archives until a more favorable time. However, the consular office, in the name of the whole, notified the Public Concession Bureau that the bureau had not consulted the Consular Body when it took over the archives, so the bureau must resolve the matter itself. Fu Xiaoan told reporters that he was unwilling to wait long beyond the time necessary for the Public Concession Bureau to decide to hand over the archives. If they are not handed over in the short term, he may declare the archives and maps invalid, and the boundary stones in areas outside the Concession may be removed. Regarding the negotiations on roads outside the boundary, Fu said that it is now his turn to give a final answer to the proposal made by Major Bowen, Chief of the Public Concession Bureau's police department, three weeks ago. However, the Public Concession Bureau's attitude towards the archives shows that the bureau is not eager to find a solution to the problem of roads outside the boundary.</p>

<h3>Avenue Haig, Name Seems Likely to Be Removed, Currently a "Nameless Road", Future Naming to Be Decided by Authorities</h3>
<p>According to the French-language "Journal de Shanghai," the road sign for Avenue Haig in the French Concession was suddenly removed in the middle of the night last Friday (the 14th). The road is now nameless. According to French custom, roads named after people are mostly to reward those who have served France, regardless of whether they are alive or dead, to express respect. This time, Italy declared war on France, and the French Concession still has the road name of its king, which is quite offensive. Therefore, it is best to remove it. As for the future naming of this nameless road, it will be up to the municipal authorities.</p>
<p>There are many precedents for road name changes</p>
<p>During the European War in 1914, there was also a road in the French Concession named Route Zikron, in memory of a famous German doctor. After the outbreak of the war, the road sign was suddenly taken away one night, and the road name was privately changed to Avenue Joffre. Later, Route Zikron was renamed Avenue Albert, and Baoshang Road was renamed Avenue Joffre. As for the person who removed the road sign of Baolong Road, he soon returned to his country to participate in the war and was killed in battle. The French Concession authorities, in memory of him, named the road after his name, which is now Wenlin Road.</p>
<h3>Japanese Organizations Request That the Public Concession Bureau Use Japanese in Documents</h3>
<p>According to Japanese sources yesterday, Japanese organizations in this port are now requesting that the Public Concession Bureau use both English and Japanese in all official documents. This request will be raised by the Japanese director of the Public Concession Bureau to the authorities. Japanese people will soon organize a taxpayer association to negotiate this matter directly with the Public Concession Bureau.</p>
<h3>Nanjing Commercial Savings Bank Suddenly Closes, Limited Scope, No Impact, Some Small Private Banks Also Fail</h3>
<p>The Shanghai branch of the Nanjing Commercial Savings Bank, located at the corner of Jiujiang Road and Sichuan Road, has been established for nearly a year. Yesterday morning, for some unknown reason, it suddenly stopped operating, tightly closing its doors, preventing those who went to withdraw money from obtaining it. Only a notice from the miscellaneous staff was posted on the bank's door, stating, "The Deputy Manager of the Shanghai Branch of this bank and the heads of various departments did not arrive at the bank during business hours today (June 18), causing the vault door to be locked and no one to open it. No one is responsible for business affairs, resulting in the suspension of business. In addition to reporting to the Board of Directors and the General Manager for instructions on how to handle the situation, we hereby request lawyers to notify the Shanghai Branch Manager, Deputy Manager, and department heads of this bank to come to the bank immediately to hand over account books, documents, important documents, and to cooperate with accountant Xi Yushu to liquidate the accounts," etc. In general, depositors were greatly alarmed by the bank's sudden closure, which made it impossible to withdraw money.</p>
<p>In the past two weeks, the price of gold has fluctuated greatly, and many who speculated in gold have lost money. According to reporters from Daguan News Agency, who investigated the industry, about ten silver shops and small private banks have failed. Most of them are newly established and have not joined the Money Exchange Association. However, they are reluctant to talk about the failures and are very secretive, unwilling to announce it to the outside world. It is said that the losses from this failure are only between 10,000 and 20,000 yuan, up to 60,000 or 70,000 yuan at most.</p>
<h3>Norwegian Consul General in Shanghai Vows Loyalty to the Norwegian King, Denounces Quisling's Puppet Government, Norwegian Consular Jurisdiction Never Threatened</h3>
<p>The "North-China Daily News" reported that Norwegian Consul General in Shanghai and Consul General to the United Kingdom, Mr. Kruge, stated yesterday (June 17) that he resolutely pledges allegiance to the King of Norway and the Norwegian government in London and denounces Quisling as the most despicable Norwegian. According to Mr. Kruge, after the German army invaded Norway, it sent Quisling to organize a short-lived puppet government. At that time, he received a telegram from the Quisling government ordering him to obey orders, but he did not respond to this telegram. Any power established in Norway by the Germans is merely a puppet and has not been approved by the King of Norway. A few days after receiving this telegram, the Quisling government ceased its activities. Norwegians are now determined to obey the only qualified Norwegian government, as in the past. The government is currently with the King of Norway and the Crown Prince in London. When Norway was about to be invaded, Norwegian expatriates here were busy, and after the German army occupied Norway, the Norwegian expatriates were quite anxious, eagerly awaiting news from Europe and their homeland. He will handle many complex issues that need attention, especially the affairs of Norwegian merchants and shipping here. The work is quite laborious. Norwegian ships still fly the Norwegian flag, but they have stopped sailing to Norwegian ports. He received and followed the orders issued by the Norwegian Shipping Committee, which is currently in London. Since the outbreak of war in Europe, Norwegian consular jurisdiction in China has not been threatened. The rumor that a certain party exerted pressure to force Norwegians to give up their consular jurisdiction in China is not true. Since Norway was drawn into the war, the personnel of the Norwegian Consular Office in this city have been working as usual, handling several cases under its jurisdiction. Mr. Kruge concluded by expressing his unwavering belief that Norway will eventually obtain justice, and said that the only legitimate government of Norway is now with the King of Norway and the Crown Prince in London.</p>
<h3>French Vice Consul Supervised Relief in the Nanshi Refugee Area, Whether to End the Charitable Lottery, No Decision Has Been Made</h3>
<p>After Father Jacquinot left Shanghai, the Nanshi Refugee Area was discussed by the Relief Committee and office staff. It was decided to end it at the end of this month. Young and strong refugees will be given half a month's rations and scattered. The old, weak, and disabled will be transferred to the Puyu Hall for accommodation. Before leaving, Father Jacquinot entrusted the follow-up matters in the district to the French Vice Consul in Shanghai, Mr. Esparbès, to preside over. Mr. Esparbès is also a member of the Refugee Area Supervisory Committee. Therefore, Mr. Esparbès is supervising the staff to actively handle various follow-up matters. As for whether the French Chamber of Commerce and Industry Charitable Lottery will cease publication with the end of the Refugee Area, nothing has been heard yet. The lottery has been issued for twenty issues, and its twenty-first issue is scheduled to be drawn on the 21st of this month.</p>
<h3>Water and Electricity in the French Concession Rumored to Be Increasing Prices Again, Submitted to the Public Works Bureau, Rumored to Be Inevitable</h3>
<p>According to Dazhong News Agency, water and electricity in the French Concession will increase prices again in the near future. It is said that the water and electricity company has submitted this request to the Public Works Bureau. The Public Works Bureau has handed it over to the Board of Directors for research because the matter is important and will conduct a careful audit of the company's business situation, income and expenditure, and the relationship between the water and electricity company and the Public Works Bureau, and then decide whether to approve it or not. However, it is rumored that the price increase is inevitable and may be approved by the Board of Directors. If so, the citizens of the French Concession will really be unable to bear it, which is something that should be noted.</p>
<h3>Stalls on Seymour Road Vegetable Market Have Insufficient Scales, Fines and Confiscation of Weighing Instruments</h3>
<p>The following stallholders in the Seymour Road Vegetable Market were fined and punished separately by the court on the 14th of this month after the Public Works Bureau found that the weight of the goods sold was insufficient:</p>
<h3>The Dredging Bureau's Decision to Expand Dredging Will Take Effect on July 1, The Fuxing Is Trying to Sail to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Since the Dredging Bureau was forced to reorganize, small-scale dredging has begun, but only a few thousand cubic meters of mud are dredged every day. The autumn floods are coming soon, and dredging is urgent. It has been decided to start a larger-scale dredging project on July 1. Regarding the haibao dredging boats participating in the dredging, the ropes, paints, yarn heads, climbing roots, machine oil, fuel oil, hardware, mild steel bars, mild steel plates, tools, and miscellaneous materials required by the measuring boats from July 1 to December 31 for six months were publicly tendered yesterday. In addition, the bureau considered that the dredging project was arduous, and the sister dredging boat of the Jianshe, the Fuxing, which was stranded in the Danzig shipyard, was also trying to sail to Shanghai to participate in the work. However, it is difficult to predict whether it can come to Shanghai due to the intense European war.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Customs Seized Another Batch of French Currency Smuggled to Sea, All Confiscated After Being Seized</h3>
<p>Zhejiang Customs has been very strict in inspecting French currency smuggled to sea. Recently, it was found that it was not easy to smuggle by ship, so fishing boats were used to smuggle. Zhejiang Customs seized two ice-carrying boats and seized 15,000 yuan of French currency. On the 16th, it was reported that an ice-carrying boat from Jintang, boat number Ji Zi 2555, was carrying 45,000 French currency to sea, starting from Shanghai. The ice-carrying boat was found to be sailing from Yongkai Town, and 2,000 yuan of French currency was seized by the customs and confiscated according to regulations.</p>
<h3>Few Sources of Miscellaneous Taxes and Dues, Insufficient Pork Supply</h3>
<p>Pork in Shanghai is becoming increasingly scarce and prices are rising daily. According to meat merchants, at present, in Nantong, such as Xingang, Qingang, etc., all pig boats passing through the river must wait for a certain navy to levy so-called "donations" before issuing a pass, and then they can pass. Therefore, in general, pig merchants have little profit to make due to the heavy exploitation on land and water, and they do not come out. This is a major reason. Therefore, for a week, the average number of pigs arriving in Shanghai every day is only about 1,500, while the two concessions need 3,000 to be able to cope with the situation.</p>
<h3>Public Works Bureau Organizes Rickshaw Group Meeting</h3>
<p>The Public Works Bureau, in view of the difficulty in maintaining the public rickshaw industry due to the soaring prices of various materials for the car body, and the economic difficulties of the rickshaw pullers' mutual aid association, has repeatedly requested relief. Therefore, it has organized a special group committee to conduct a general study of the current situation of the rickshaw industry in this port. The committee members include Harris, Xi Yushu, He Dekui (deputy general manager of the bureau), Ms. Xing De (director of the industrial section), and rickshaw managers. It is learned that before the bureau implements the investigation by the above-mentioned group committee, it has decided on temporary relief measures, that is, from the 20th of this month, the public rickshaw fare will be allowed to increase by 15 cents per car per day, and from July, the subsidy to the rickshaw pullers' mutual aid association will be increased by 50 cents per car per month.</p>
<h3>News Roundup</h3>
<p>Stallholders Request: The stallholders in the Baxianqiao small vegetable market in the French Concession were greatly panicked when they learned about the reorganization. They all said that at this extraordinary time, life is difficult. If they move their stalls, it will inevitably affect their business and be of great importance. Therefore, in addition to writing to the French Consul General to consider the difficulties of the business and withdraw the order to avoid moving the stalls in order to maintain business, they also designated Sun Jingyuan, Zhu Changsheng, and more than ten others as stallholder representatives to request assistance from various French groups and Chinese directors.</p>
<p>Prohibit Buying Pawn Tickets: The Public Concession Bureau of the Public Concession has added a strict prohibition on the trade of buying and selling pawn tickets due to many malpractices. It is now heard that the French Consul General has also ordered a strict prohibition on residents of the French Concession from engaging in the trade of buying and selling pawn tickets in order to eliminate malpractices. It is said that the French Public Works Bureau and the French Police Department have received this order and are implementing it separately within their respective scopes of authority.</p>
<p>Fill in the Certificate Form in Detail: The City Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to various related industry associations, such as cotton cloth dyeing and weaving, yesterday, stating that all the items that should be filled in on the six-part national product certificate form issued by the association should be filled in item by item, without omission. Recently, it was found that the application forms filled in by various factories and shops only filled in the destination but not the receiving merchant, and some only filled in the general shore to the interior, such as the sesame stamp, but did not indicate where they were transferred to, and the date of application. All these situations are equivalent to pre-using the blank space, leaving it for the factories and shops to fill in at will in the future, which has serious malpractices. The association should strictly review when transferring, and if there is any omission, it should be rejected immediately. In addition, the application forms filled in by various factories and shops are often unclear. It is hoped that the subordinates will be notified to pay attention to the correction and carefully review them when transferring.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese in Germany Encounter Hardship, Embassy Provides Assistance, Poor Overseas Chinese Receive US$10 in Assistance, Most Have Abandoned Business Life</h3>
<p>Since the European War, overseas Chinese, whether they are engaged in business or studying, have been affected by the war and cannot continue to work. In the past six months, countless people have returned to China one after another. According to the news from various travel groups that receive overseas Chinese returning to China, the number of overseas Chinese who have lost their jobs and schooling is the largest in France, Germany, and Italy. The rest of the countries, such as the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Belgium, are mostly students. After the war, many overseas Chinese in Germany and Italy transferred to France. Those overseas Chinese who have more savings have returned to China one after another. The remaining ones are mostly poor. It is said that they have been forced to abandon their business and are engaged in various wartime production jobs in various countries. In addition, there are a large number of overseas Chinese in Germany who are living in poverty due to unemployment and are no different from refugees. The Chinese Embassy in Germany, in order to relieve poor overseas Chinese, has recently processed the assistance of travel expenses to return to China, US$10 per person. However, due to the high cost of funding after the war and the need to transfer routes, those with a little strength can make up for it. Therefore, recently, many overseas Chinese in Germany have received assistance and transferred to Italy.</p>

<h3>Habitual Blackmailer, Rearrested for Extortion, and Forging Documents and Framing Indiscriminately, After Investigation, All Cases Were Detained and Prosecuted</h3>
<p>Dai Xianfang from Ningbo and Sun Xinian from Shaoxing previously used intimidation to extort a huge sum of money from Wang Xianglin, the owner of Zengli Yarn Company at Room 108, Hartung Building, 233 Nanjing Road. Wang reported to the police, and the two were detained by the First Special Court and sentenced to six months in prison with a three-year reprieve. Dai and Sun were unrepentant after being released from prison. Recently, they colluded with Zhang Desheng, a former bounty hunter who had closed down, to discuss revenge methods. After discussion, they decided to take two steps. One was for Zhang to report to Shenxin No. 9 Yarn Factory that Wang Xianglin was replacing inferior goods with Shenxin brand, so that Shenxin could report to the police. The second was for Zhang to come forward and intimidate Wang Xianglin, accusing him of forging fake Consolidated Tax Bureau tax bills and ordering Wang to pay a huge sum of money. If Wang did not pay, Zhang would try to transport the forged tax bills into the Perry warehouse, so that Shenxin could report to the police and the police could search and find the fake bills and be subject to legal sanctions. After the discussion was finalized, Zhang first implemented his second method. On the 8th of this month, Zhang brought Wang Xianglin to the Guohua Opium Den on Heping Road and accused Wang of counterfeiting Shenxin products with inferior goods and forging tax bills, and asked Wang to pay 7,500 yuan to settle the matter, otherwise he would report it. Although Wang knew that Zhang and others were deliberately extorting money, he was afraid of their despicable methods. In order to settle the matter, he gave 1,000 yuan, but Zhang insisted on the original amount, which led to the breakdown of the negotiation. Zhang then implemented his first method and reported to Shenxin No. 9 Factory. The factory reported to the Jingansi Police Station, and Chief Detective Yao Yuanlong and Detective Ni Jiafeng went to arrest Wang Xianglin, manager Wang Zhengfu, and partner Wang Jianzhang. They seized 1,355 fake true tax bills from the Consolidated Tax Bureau. After investigation, it was learned that Zhang, Dai, Sun, and others had intimidated and extorted money and intended to frame them. The three were arrested again. They seized 387 forged tax bureau transportation documents, a tax bureau seal, and a zinc plate and sent them to the First Special Court for interrogation. Yesterday morning, this case was continued to be heard by Judge Liu Yugui in the Second Criminal Court. The three Wangs hired lawyers Qian Jia, Li Baosen, and Zhang Desheng hired lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Enliang to defend them. Police lawyer Li Zhishan filed a lawsuit against Zhang Desheng, Sun Xinian, and Dai Xianfang for intimidation and extortion under Article 346 of the Criminal Law and forgery under Article 211 of the same law, and sued Perry for receiving stolen goods under Article 349 of the Criminal Law, because the 1,355 tax bills stored in the Perry warehouse were considered stolen goods and received. After detailed questioning by Judge Liu, he ordered a one-week postponement for investigation and further hearing.</p>
<h3>Zhao Brothers and Sisters in Guangdong Sued for Inheritance, Each Party Holds Its Own View, Court Discusses Summoning Witnesses for Further Verification</h3>
<p>Zhao Zuoheng (22 years old this year), a Guangdong native who graduated from the Eaton Aviation University in the United Kingdom, and Zhao Zuyi, Zhao Xiuxin, etc., who currently live at No. 60 Jing'an Villa, Jing'an Temple Road, are brothers and sisters. They are all grandsons and granddaughters of the late Zhao Zhuochen from Foshan, Guangdong. Zhao Zhuochen left a huge inheritance. In July 1933, he made a will to extract 70,000 yuan in national currency from the inheritance as education and marriage expenses for the eight brothers and sisters Zhao Zuoheng, Zuyi, Xiuxin, Zishuang, Bishuang, Zuxi, Zuyuan, and Shuxin. The funds were the responsibility of Ms. Li, the biological mother of Zhao Zuyi, etc., to keep, and she used the funds to purchase a piece of land and 52 houses on Xinjiang Road, receiving more than 1,000 yuan in rent per month. Recently, Zhao Zuoheng accused his brother Zhao Zuyi and others of seizing the inheritance and hired lawyer Ma Junshuo to file a complaint in the civil court of the First Special Court, accusing Zhao Zuyi of dereliction of duty.</p>
<p>He requested confirmation of the joint ownership of the land and houses in Tianxinli, Xinjiang Road, and in accordance with Zhao Zhuochen's will, four grandsons each received one share, and four granddaughters each received half a share, a total of six shares, and requested that Zhao Zuyi and others be ordered to distribute one-sixth to the plaintiff. The court heard the case yesterday. Defendant Zhao Zuyi and others entrusted lawyer Dan Yuhua to act as their agent and appeared in court to answer. It was said that the plaintiff Zhao Zuoheng had already withdrawn several thousand Hong Kong dollars in education expenses when he was practicing law in Hong Kong and had been married. There are still several unmarried defendants. The 70,000 yuan of national currency bequeathed by Zhao Zhuochen specified that the funds were for education and marriage, which is currently difficult to analyze. Therefore, he requested that the plaintiff's lawsuit be dismissed. The court reviewed the statements and ordered a postponement to summon witnesses for further hearing.</p>
<h3>Impersonating Firefighters - Arrested for Fraud</h3>
<p>Recently, within the Public Concession, individuals dressed in firefighter uniforms have been impersonating fire department personnel. They have been coercively selling fire extinguishers to households at exorbitant prices, seizing the opportunity to extort money. The police department has received numerous reports and has ordered a strict and thorough investigation. Unexpectedly, yesterday (the 17th) at 12:45 PM, two individuals, Huang Gongxia (30 years old, residing at No. 18 Li'an Lane, Xigong Road) and Shi Mingren (25 years old), dressed in firefighter uniforms and carrying fire extinguishers, went to the residence of Zhang Haiquan on Huishan Road. They claimed to be sent by the fire department to install fire extinguishers, demanding a high price. Huang later stated that if Zhang contributed funds, the installation could be waived. Zhang, sensing something amiss, reported it to the police, who apprehended Huang and Shi. It was discovered that they were impersonators. The police department, recognizing Huang and his accomplice's history of repeated offenses, earnestly encourages victims to come forward and press charges to deter such troublemakers.</p>
<h3>Factory Owner Abuses His Wife</h3>
<p>Qiu Gengtang, a native of Ningbo and the 25-year-old owner of Hengchang Machinery Factory on Zhoujiazui Road in Hongkou, married Xu Zhitian (currently 27 years old), also a native of Ningbo, ten years ago. They have had five children together, two of whom have passed away. However, in the first month of this year, Qiu became involved with a hostess named Tu Lili from the Family Guidance Association, which drastically changed his behavior. He began to abuse Xu frequently and neglected his younger brother, Fu Tang, who was bedridden in the hospital with tuberculosis. Xu repeatedly wanted to sue Qiu, but she was dissuaded by relatives and friends. Last night, a conflict erupted between Qiu and his wife again, and Qiu severely beat her, causing injuries. Xu, extremely angry, reported the incident to the Huishan Police Station. Detectives were dispatched to arrest him, but Qiu had already fled without a trace. In addition to seeking legal recourse, the police are actively investigating Qiu's whereabouts to bring him to justice.</p>
<h3>Dissected Female Corpse Case Takes an Unexpected Turn - Teacher Accuses Principal - Shen Weiwei Arrested After Investigation</h3>
<p>Huang Jinxiu, a woman from Pudong residing at No. 15, Lane 40, Zhoujiapai Road, Yangshupu, went to work at the Japanese-owned Shanghai Cotton Mill on Yangshupu Road on the morning of the 10th of this month. She did not return that night and was found to have been raped and murdered, her body divided into six sections and discarded in the wilderness. After the Chinese and foreign detectives of the Yangshupu Police Station recovered Huang's</p>
<p>dissected body in the wasteland of Meizhou Road, Zhoujiapai Road, Hangzhou Road, Yangshupu Xihu Road and other places, they arrested four suspects from Changzhou: Sheng Hongsheng, Wu Cheng, Gu Licai, and Ding Jifa from Ningbo. They were sent to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. All details have been reported in this newspaper. During the adjourned hearing, it was determined that Wu and Gu were not involved, and they were released. Sheng and Ding were detained. Unexpectedly, Shen Weiwei (22 years old), a native of Chongming and a teacher at the Shihui Honglian Elementary School on Meizhou Road,</p>
<p>had a dispute with Gu Yansheng, the principal from Haimen, when he was a teacher at Fenzhou Elementary School on Fenzhou Road, and was dismissed by Gu. Seeing the newspaper report about the inhumane murder of Huang, he seized the opportunity to write a pair of anonymous letters in English and mailed them to the Yangshupu Police Station. The letters claimed that the murder of Huang was instigated by Gu Yansheng, the principal of Fenzhou School, and that the sender was involved. The police station dispatched detective Ji Xiucheng with the letters to investigate. Principal Gu was very surprised, as he did not know</p>
<p>Huang. Detective Ji asked him if he had any enemies recently. Gu examined the English handwriting in the letter and recognized it as Shen Weiwei's. He then explained that Shen had been dismissed in January of this year for frequently taking leave. Detective Ji immediately went to the Lianyi Elementary School and arrested Shen. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Third Criminal Court, where police lawyer Jiang Baolian described the process and requested detention. Shen confessed without hesitation. Judge Jiang Shuzi ordered him to be detained and scheduled a joint hearing with Sheng Hongsheng.</p>

<h3>Adopted Son Does Not Recognize Adoptive Mother - Accused of Abandonment - Court Orders Defendant to Post Bail Pending Judgment</h3>
<p>Wu Gu, a 48-year-old woman from Chuansha, Pudong, residing at No. 5 Zhengde Lane, Myers Road, recently retained lawyer Zhang Shanle to file a lawsuit with the criminal division of the Second Special District Court, accusing her adopted son, Wu Yongrui (also known as Xue Yuncai, 24 years old, from Taizhou, residing at No. 12, Lane 816, Myers Road) of abandonment. The lawsuit states: "The defendant lost his job due to the war. In October 1937, due to financial difficulties, he requested to be</p>
<p>adopted by me.</p>
<p>Since my late husband had passed away, I granted his request to relieve my loneliness in my later years and provided him with food and lodging. I also spent over three hundred yuan on clothing for him, treating him as my own son. Up until January of this year, I also arranged his wedding, spending over seven hundred yuan. My life savings have been almost completely exhausted. Unexpectedly, he harbored malicious intentions and on March 6, due to an argument, he beat the plaintiff and</p>
<p>fled, taking all the furniture, belongings, and jewelry in the house,</p>
<p>leaving me to fend for myself. I had no choice but to temporarily return to my father's home. The defendant is currently a foreman in a hat factory, earning over two hundred yuan per month, but refuses to support me, despite my inability to provide for myself. His actions constitute fraud and malicious abandonment. I have no choice but to request the court to punish him according to Articles 294 and 295 of the Criminal Code and to order him to pay a monthly living allowance of thirty yuan, totaling three thousand six hundred yuan for ten years." The court accepted the lawsuit, and Judge Tan Hao convened a criminal</p>
<p>court session yesterday afternoon</p>
<p>for the hearing. The defendant hired lawyer Xuan Zhendong to defend him. He stated, "I lived at the plaintiff's residence with my master, Huang Kefa, in 1937. I was introduced by others as the plaintiff's adopted son, and there is written evidence. However, the plaintiff often abused the defendant and his wife, so we separated. I am unwilling to bear the monthly living expenses demanded by the plaintiff." The court reviewed the arguments and, considering the case to be clear, ordered closing arguments. Judgment was scheduled for the 22nd, and the defendant was released on bail, with the defending lawyer responsible for ensuring his appearance.</p>

<h3>Three Labor Strikes - Currently Under Negotiation</h3>
<p>Drivers Demand Reinstatement - More than ten labor representatives from the Yunfei Xiang Sheng Tailai Yinse Four Taxi Companies submitted a protest to the Yunfei Taxi Company regarding the dismissal of 37 drivers, including Xu Binggao and Wang Zicheng. According to the labor representatives, the 37 drivers dismissed by Yunfei Company were recently hired several months ago and were specifically assigned to serve at the company's gambling den on Daxi Road. As the gambling den has recently been closed, the company intends to dismiss them. However, the labor representatives argued that according to a previous agreement between labor and management, drivers cannot be dismissed unless they have committed a mistake. Therefore, they requested the company to withdraw its decision. It is also reported that the two sides are scheduled to negotiate this afternoon.</p>
<p>Plank Workers' Conditions - The Plank Manufacturing Workers' Union, organized by the plank industry workers in this city, submitted a written request to the Plank Manufacturing Businessmen's Association on the 11th of this month to improve the treatment of workers.

However, some workers insisted that the daily wage be increased to a total of 2.10 yuan or 2.40 yuan, and refused to return to work. The strike has not been completely resolved. The political department summoned the management representative, Du Chan, again yesterday to discuss the matter.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Editor of the Shen Bao:</p>
<p>Recently, I read a section in the "Local News" section of your newspaper on the 18th of this month entitled "Silk Merchant Zhang Shenglang Hinders Family," which stated that Zhu Jingwen was studying obstetrics at the Dade Obstetrics Hospital at the intersection of Xinzha Road and Gordon Road. After investigation, our school does not have this student. It is certainly a rumor. I am writing to clarify this matter and hope that you will correct it.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<h3>Opening a River in the Examination Hall</h3>
<p>The water for the Zhejiang examination hall is all drawn from the West Lake, which is quite far from the examination compound. Therefore, after the water carriers finish one shift of work, the gates are opened to release the water, and the ground outside the compound becomes too wet to walk on. Previously, the inside of the compound was also wet. Later, a water conduit was built to channel the outside water and pour it into the compound, creating a new system, which can be considered a well-considered and perfect solution. Now, Commissioner Mei wants to further accommodate the human element and open a river within the examination hall, connecting the water from the east and west bridges inside the main gate. However, in recent years, the Zhejiang examination hall has been plagued by various forms of cheating. External assistance is often smuggled in through the water pipes. Since the water pipes run from the outside to the inside, if someone is stationed near the water pipe, they can retrieve any oiled paper packages that flow in, and then distribute them according to the test number. How can anyone know about this? When the exam questions are released, the clear-sighted</p>
<p>officials write the questions in large characters above, and people outside the compound use telescopes to read them</p>
<p>without any mistake. The questions come from the distant tower, and the answers come in through the water pipes. This has been a problem in every session. From this perspective, opening the external river into the examination compound would make transmission even faster than through the water pipes. Some might say that the external river passes through the main gate but is outside the ceremonial gate, so it cannot reach the examination cells, and there is no need to worry too much. But how did the water pipes reach the inside? Others might say that more patrolling officials should be stationed along the riverbanks to patrol constantly, so that this problem can be completely eliminated. But which patrolling official would be willing to sit there seriously?</p>

<h3>On Increasing Tuition Fees</h3>
<p>— Xin Liang</p>
<p>Last Saturday afternoon, I saw a notice that my younger brother brought home from school. It listed many things to pay attention to at the end of the semester, one of which was that the school would be increasing tuition by three yuan starting next semester due to rising prices and large expenditures, in order to supplement the budget.</p>
<p>Then, on Sunday, I saw Mr. Xi Yushu's remarks on the issue of increasing tuition in Shanghai schools. He said, "...You must know that if teachers cannot maintain their livelihood, then no one will be willing to be a teacher; without teachers, there is no education, then the education of children will be difficult. Therefore, increasing tuition to allow teachers to have a reasonable livelihood means that children can receive a reasonable education, which is a matter of utmost public interest..."</p>
<p>Indeed, we all know that elementary school teachers are suffering too much these days. If teachers' lives are not stable, they will never be at peace with education. If they have to worry about firewood, rice, oil, and rent every day, how can they have the energy to devote to teaching? Therefore, increasing tuition so that teachers can live a reasonable life, and indirectly, children can receive a more reasonable education, is indeed something that should be done without a doubt.</p>
<p>I only hope that every school that has had surpluses in the past and is not planning to increase tuition starting next semester is the best. If they have to increase it, then they should do as Mr. Xi Yushu said: to raise teachers' salaries, and not to use the name of increasing fees to seek personal enjoyment and benefit.</p>
<h3>Alive</h3>
<p>— Yun</p>
<p>Shouting at the top of my lungs all day, dragging my slightly swollen legs home, the only thing I love is the tattered quilt on the narrow bed. But after lying down and relaxing my muscles, I have to grade the ninety arithmetic exercises that I brought back. It's almost impossible to have a comfortable dinner. Alas! Being a teacher! It's more tiring than managing ninety machines, my goodness!</p>
<p>It's dusk, washing clothes, mending socks, and being able to sleep peacefully, but the clock always refuses to sympathize with my busy schedule and insists on striking eleven o'clock. If my older sister hadn't promised to take care of the two children during the day, I'm afraid I wouldn't even be able to keep this ten yuan a month job.</p>
<p>Watching the clock hands pass twelve o'clock, after finally coaxing four-year-old Xin to sleep with great effort, but before the light has been off for even five minutes, my heels and shoulders start to itch. I'll try to endure it! I'm afraid it will wake the child again. Anyway, every corner of the lonely island is home to those hateful night thieves. I should develop a calm and composed attitude at night, and then use lightning tactics during the day to clear their nests. That's why the always small Yun gets angry and attacks these annoying creatures, so that she won't lose sleep from being woken up. But the mice are angry that they can't break through the iron can to get at the few remaining crackers, and somehow they knock it over on the ground, rolling and throwing it with all their might. They have attacked my weak point, knowing that I won't get up to bother them. But if they really open the can and ruin these crackers, how will I soothe Xin's nighttime cries? So I have to put them next to my pillow, although I still can't sleep soundly. I'm afraid I won't be able to get up by six o'clock tomorrow to make it to my first class, so I silently count one, two, three, four, five... faintly, it seems like the bell is ringing, and our class of autumn students comes rushing into the classroom like a tide. Suddenly, a child's toe gets stepped on, and he squats at the door crying. Just as I'm about to go over and pull him up, something slaps me in the face, and I wake up in shock. Xin is crying and angry, flailing her legs like drums. No wonder it seemed in my dream that the students' footsteps were shaking my body. It's really funny and annoying at the same time.</p>
<p>Xin, you're really my nemesis! You're simply taking my life! You don't forgive me at all for the life of a cow and horse that I lead as a mother. These short six hours of sleep are the only tonic for prolonging my life. Why do you always have to cry three or four times a night, making me stay up all night with you? Am I not going to die? I once beat you hard, but afterwards, I couldn't help but shed tears, thinking about the money that your father sends from Chengdu. Aside from half of it being used for exchange rates, and the delay in time, if I didn't have this teaching job, wouldn't I really be hanging up three mouths every month to wait for assistance? So, I patiently coax you to sleep again, and let myself get a moment's sleep, to take on the responsibility of teaching tomorrow.</p>
<h3>A Notice in the Shelter</h3>
<p>— Citizen</p>
<p>"Notice: It has been found that refugee Zhang from District ×× secretly allowed an outsider without a tag to stay in the district. After investigation by the night duty officer, it was confirmed and admitted. The law of joint liability should be enforced, and the refugee and his family should be expelled from the shelter. It has also been found that refugee Li from District ×× has bad behavior and does not maintain order. Yesterday, when entering the shelter from outside, he should have been checked for a tag by the correction officer, who has a duty to do so. The refugee not only did not comply, but also responded with insults. After the correction division questioned him and tried to persuade him, his attitude remained fierce. Considering the circumstances, he is intentionally disrupting order. To maintain the safety of the entire shelter, it is appropriate to expel him from the shelter. This is a combined notice to serve as a warning to others!..."</p>
<p>The above notice was personally seen by the writer in the ×× shelter on June 14, and it was heard that it was executed on the same day. After seeing the notice, I couldn't help but feel that the notice was self-contradictory. If the correction officer checks for tags when refugees enter the shelter, how can there be an outsider without a tag staying in the district? At the same time, whether the wording in the notice is suitable for the identity of the shelter is also a question. Words such as "law of joint liability" and the "questioning" in the questioning, the shelter becomes a yamen, what about charity!</p>
<h3>The Stamp on the Pawn Ticket Also Accrues Monthly Interest</h3>
<p>— Mirror</p>
<p>All financial transactions in society use evidence, and enough stamps must be affixed to the evidence. This is true for all industries, and the pawn industry is naturally no exception. However, the procedure for affixing stamps in various industries is the obligation of the issuer of the evidence, so the pawn ticket should undoubtedly be the responsibility of the pawnbroker. However, although the pawnshop affixes the stamp on behalf, the stamp fee is still included in the pawn price. This not only requires the pawner to bear the stamp fee, but also to bear 1.8% monthly interest on the stamp tax. What kind of rule is this?</p>

<h3>Homecoming After the Dance</h3>
<p>— By Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter Two: "A Page of the Past!"</p>
<p>Li Zhiban was a man of about fifty. Although he hunched his back and coughed as he walked, showing some signs of age, his complexion and eyes were still vigorous. He was not tall, and his muscles were relatively thin. His hair was gray, cut in a round-top style, and he did not have a beard. He wore a dark blue old crepe de chine camel-hair robe and old-fashioned double-strap black satin-faced cloth-soled shoes, appearing simple but dignified and generous. Later, I learned that he was a private tutor in Wuta Town in the countryside of Wu County. This kind of dress was indeed appropriate for his profession.</p>
<p>After Hawthorne greeted him, Ni Jinshou introduced them to each other, and they all sat around the small round table. I also sat at one end of the long bench. Due to Qun Sang's inquiry, which seemed to focus on the deceased's past, the old man explained his relationship with the deceased and the circumstances before she engaged in a life of dancing.</p>
<p>Li Zhiban said, "Lilan's childhood name in the countryside was A'bao. Her father was my brother-in-law and also taught in the countryside. A'bao—Lilan—lost her mother at the age of seven and her father at the age of nine. After that, I raised her and she studied in my private school for several years."</p>
<p>"A'bao—Lilan—changed her ways at the age of seventeen because a woman named Zhaodi from the same town returned from Shanghai. According to Zhaodi, she worked in some factory and earned a good income. Lilan, hearing Zhaodi's exaggerated descriptions and seeing Zhaodi dressed like a young lady from a wealthy family, became envious. She clamored to go to Shanghai with Zhaodi. I tried to dissuade her repeatedly, but to no avail, so I had to let her go. Once she arrived in Shanghai, she never returned to the countryside. I thought she was working in a factory, but I didn't know she was involved in this dancing business! Now it has taken her life! Alas! It really wasn't worth it!" He sighed repeatedly and coughed twice. (Nineteen)</p>

<h3>A Meeting with the Wan Brothers, Pioneers of Chinese Cartoons</h3>
<p>— Tai Gong</p>
<p>Special Interest in Cartoons, Hoping to Add Glory to the Film Industry</p>
<p>The most outstanding figures in the domestic film industry engaged in cartoon work are currently the four Wan brothers: Laiming, Guchan, Chao Chen, and Di Huan. Currently, Di Huan is far away in the mainland, and Chao Chen is in charge of the Wan Brothers Photography Studio. The eldest brother, Laiming, and the second brother, Guchan, were hired by the China United Film Company in May to head the cartoon department and produce full-length cartoons. The first film, "Princess Iron Fan," is currently in active production. Yesterday, the reporter visited the Lianhe factory site in Lilac Garden and had a conversation with the Laiming and Guchan brothers in the cartoon department. Here is an excerpt:</p>
<p>From a young age, they grew up in Nanjing and studied together at Jinling Middle School. After graduating, the brothers came to Shanghai together and entered the Shanghai Academy of Fine Arts. With shared interests, they studied fine arts and photography together, and gradually began to pay attention to cartoons. After leaving the Academy of Fine Arts, Laiming became an editor at the Commercial Press, while Guchan worked in the film department of the Commercial Press.</p>
<p>In 1925, the two brothers joined the Great Wall Film Company. "Making a Fuss in the Study Room" was the maiden work of cartoon short films in the Chinese film industry.</p>
<p>In 1927, an American came to Shanghai to establish a cartoon film company, preparing to specialize in cartoon films. However, due to poor business, it was announced that it would be shut down. In this way, the Wan brothers bought all of the American's cartoon equipment. After testing it, it turned out to be excellent. Thus, "Paper Man's Troubles" was born. Subsequently, Lianhua's "Dog Detective" and Mingxing's "Camel Dancing" and "New Life" were all co-produced by the four Wan brothers and screened. After the August 13th Incident, Laiming left Shanghai for Chongqing due to the poor environment. Before long, Guchan was hired by the Wuxi Provincial Education College to serve as a cartoon lecturer and practical instructor in the film and broadcasting major. Later, as various places fell one after another, Guchan went from Zhenjiang to Nanjing, Hankou, and then to Chongqing. In Kunming, he met his elder brother Laiming. They once wanted to open a photography studio, but it was unsuccessful due to frequent air raids. In September of last year, the two brothers returned to Shanghai. Laiming opened the Wan Laiming Photography Studio, and in April, at the invitation of Zhang Shankun, he cooperated and joined Lianhe to be responsible for the cartoon department. The official head of the department is the second brother, Wan Guchan. The eldest brother, Laiming, is nominally the deputy head due to his photography studio business.</p>
<p>Before the two joined Lianhe, a capitalist from Hong Kong (also in the film industry) asked Sun Jun Jinghai to come to Shanghai to negotiate with the Wan brothers, intending to invite them to Hong Kong to run the cartoon business. However, because of Lianhe's invitation first, the result was that they did not go to Hong Kong. However, Wan left a message for Sun Jinghai to convey to that capitalist, saying that after completing "Princess Iron Fan," perhaps his wish could be fulfilled. However, once "Princess Iron Fan" is successfully produced and achieves extremely satisfactory results, whether Lianhe will be willing to let the Wan brothers go to Hong Kong to work for others is another question.</p>
<h3>Hollywood Needs Voluptuous Stars</h3>
<p>— Jin Huang</p>
<p>—Losing Weight May Not Be Necessary.</p>
<p>Female stars are most afraid of gaining weight, and often spare no expense or endure pain to lose weight. Slim stars have always been envied by the masses. However, it is said that this phenomenon is about to be overturned. Not long ago, in the new film "Lillian Eussell," sixty fat women were selected to participate in the performance, but they were performing in the style of 1890.</p>
<p>There will probably be more opportunities to hire fat actresses in the future. The war has changed Hollywood. The European market has shrunk, and film companies have to develop in South America. However, South American audiences do not welcome thin actresses. It may be too early to determine that Hollywood must change in this way. However, it is possible. Look, Mae West has attracted a large group of discerning audiences, hasn't she? In fact, a fashionable figure like Joan Crawford is somewhat restrictive of nature.</p>
<h3>"Hometown of White Clouds" Completed During Bombing</h3>
<p>— Yi Xing</p>
<p>The last scene of "Hometown of White Clouds," directed by Situ Huimin, was shot at the home of the heroine Fengzi in Shanghai. The set was on the beach in Hong Kong, a luxurious small Western-style house, with seawater, a beach, and tall mountains standing on the other side of the sea. Part of this scene was shot on location in Hong Kong, and part was built in the factory's studio. The entire crew of the factory's art team designed and built it, taking more than a week to complete.</p>
<p>The last shot of the scene was filmed exactly when Japanese planes were bombing Chongqing. The entire crew of the film calmly completed the last shot during the bombing.</p>
<p>Also, Minister Chen (Cheng) of the Political Department of the Military Commission, and Deputy Commander-in-Chief Chuan (Zuoyi), visited the filming of the film that day and praised the hard work of the entire crew. They took a group photo with the entire crew of the film as a souvenir.</p>
<h3>Paramount Hires New Talent</h3>
<p>In the Paramount film "Night of January 16th," the male lead, Don Ameche, quit halfway through, and mediation was unsuccessful. Paramount has filed a lawsuit in court, seeking compensation for a loss of $170,000. This was noted in this column a few days ago. It is now known that Paramount originally invited Claudette Colbert to play the female lead in the film, but she declined. Then, Bela Starfill was invited to take on the role. However, when Don Ameche quit halfway, Bela Starfill also refused to continue filming, and the film had to be temporarily shelved. Among Hollywood stars, Don Ameche's temperament is known to be the most kind, so this sudden change of heart has surprised the outside world. Paramount has finally decided to cast the new female star Patricia Marrison and Ray Milland as the male and female leads in the film. The original director of the film, Mitchell Leisen, has also been transferred to direct the war novel "La Polonaise."</p>

<h3>Silver Screen Miscellany</h3>
<p>— Hai Xing</p>
<p>Meicheng's Production Policy. The production policy of Meicheng Film Company, initiated by Yan Heming, is slightly different from that of ordinary companies. It is said that it does not intend to follow the old path of folk films, but will open up a new path. It has already decided to cooperate closely with the drama world and plans to bring successful plays to the screen one by one. In addition to acquiring the filming rights to "Hai Guo Ying Wei," several other masterpieces are also being negotiated separately. The famous playwright Wei Ruhui is wholeheartedly helping, and it is expected that Meicheng's productions will refresh the audience's eyes and ears in the future.</p>
<p>The Yan Sisters Sign a Contract. Yan Yuexian is making a comeback and has reportedly joined Xinhua Company. Her sister Yueling has also joined at the same time, both signing long-term contracts. However, the works have not yet been decided. This news was not released by Xinhua Company, but it is generally reliable.</p>
<p>Wu Cun Choreographs "Chronicles of the Dance World". Wu Cun told reporters that if there are copyright issues with "Tears on the Flowers," Jin Xing will definitely give up. I think the dance venue material is very good, and the lives of the dancers have many moving and admirable aspects. The dancers' interactions with the diverse clientele provide great material. Therefore, Wu Cun plans to film a piece titled "Chronicles of the Dance World," which has been largely finalized.</p>
<h3>Tan Fuying's Announcement to Come to Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Mr. Daidai</p>
<p>The news of Tan Fuying's invitation to join Gengxin has been circulating for a long time, but it has not been realized. Recently, it has changed from rumor to fact. I received a letter from a friend yesterday announcing that Fuying's determination to come south to perform has been made. After performing his farewell play on the 16th of this month, he will pack his bags and wait for a ship to go south, and he will arrive in Shanghai around the 24th. The roles that came with Fuying include the Dan (female role) Chen Lifang, who specializes in Cheng-style Hua Shan (a type of female role), the martial arts student Yang Shengchun, the young man Jiang Miaoxiang, the copper hammer painted face Wang Quankui, the shelf painted face Ma Liankun, Ye Shengmao, the clown Ci Ruiquan, the lining old man Ha Baoshan, Song Jiting, the Hua Dan Ji Yanfen, the painted face Tan Shitian, and the clown Wei Wenkui. The talent is abundant and extremely prosperous. After resting for a few days, they will take the stage after Liang Xiaoluan and Xiao Lanfen.</p>
<h3>Theater News</h3>
<p>(1) The Lianyi Experimental Theater Troupe will perform "Su Wu Herding Sheep," jointly directed by Wu Yonggang and Yang Xiaozhong, at the Russian Academy of Dramatic Arts starting on the 19th.
