<h3 id="c11">英蘇談判與英日談判 <a href="#c11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>今日歐洲各交戰國家的處境，當以英國最稱複雜和微妙：一方領導着對德作戰，成為德國攻擊的主要對象，並在歐陸東西各部都負有保障安全的重責；另一方面因為領土遍布全球，必須顧到本邦與各屬領的聯繫及其海外權益的保持。在這重重義務和困難交併之下的大英帝國，欲其一切都措置裕如恰到好處，確不是一件容易事，所以我們對於此際英國的對外政策，自不能過事吹求，責其未能盡如人意；而同時也未始不希望英當局能夠堅定而且自重，善爲應付其內外問題，俾其對於當前的現實利益與此次作戰所揭櫫的基本原則雙方都能兼籌並顧。</p>
<p>現在遠東和歐洲的戰事還在繼續進展中，一切是非功過都要留待將來的歷史來判斷；但如果稍一檢閱英方一年以來的對外措施，當不難發現其對蘇對日的外交關係，都不免有重大的錯誤和遺憾。關於去歲英法蘇三國談判失敗的經過，其詳細情形尙未為人所盡悉，論者亦復見仁見智，各有不同的觀察；而就事變演進的結果來看，則那一談判之失敗，實為此次大戰爆發的重要導火綫，同時也就是英法一個重大打擊。談判失敗之後，繼以德蘇進兵波蘭和蘇芬戰事的爆發，英法對蘇關係愈益惡化，幾形成直接對立形勢，遂愈益促進蘇德間的結合。如果不是蘇芬間和平恰於歐戰延及丹挪之前實現，則北歐兵連禍結，形成混戰，將更增重英法的困難。更就英日關係來看：兩三年來，雖英國利益備遭侵害，英國本國也洋溢着援華反日的輿情，政府當局的對日政策總傾向着對白優容和妥協，從一九三八年底的上海海關協定到自去夏以迄於今若斷若續的東京談判都是如此，而所得結果則不過是更甚的威脅和更多的輕侮。試看最近在封鎖中天津英僑的憤激呼聲，英下院關於對日政策的不斷質問和外交當局支吾，其詞的窘態都可見今日英國對日外交正和對蘇政策同樣有重加考慮的必要。</p>
<p>自從英國擴大對德封鎖蘇德間的商業關係以及太平洋方面經過蘇聯以達德國的商業關係便形成了嚴重問題。在英法這是一個必需加以堵塞的罅隙，同時也是和一些複雜外交關係交織在一起的難關；這可能是英法對蘇爲友爲敵的關鍵，同時也可能被日閥看成對英法勒索的良機。日前曾傳聞英國準備將對德封鎖擴大到遠東，而尤以海參威為最注意的目標；幸而英法還不曾一味鹵莽滅裂的那樣去做，不然也許又鑄成難於挽救的大錯，倒使東方的侵略者坐收漁利。其實要封鎖德國東北邊境的漏巵，其關鍵僅在蘇聯一身，英法於此並無求助日方的必要。且從太平洋經由西伯利亞以輸入德國的物品器材究屬有限，更加轉運頻繁，費用重大，對德幫助並不很大。這一路綫的海陸運輸孔道都在蘇聯領土之內，只有蘇聯纔有權力加以操縱。所以英法對蘇關係如何，將為歐戰演變前途的重大關鍵。對於日閥的壓迫則力謀妥協，關於對蘇外交則任其自然，無論這是由於思想體系的影響抑或對事實認識的隔膜，衡之英法在非常時機的國家利益，終不能算是健全的政策。</p>
<p>英蘇間的政治談判雖已成陳跡，商務談判之門却始終開啟着，試看蘇大使邁斯基之屢决對英催促，可見蘇聯並不願英蘇關係之長此惡化。現在此一談判甫經開始，自不容驟即寄以奢望，但英國絕不容忽視其重要性，繼續在冷淡中任其推移。如果協約國能在冷靜縝密考慮之下力謀對蘇關係之好轉，則縱不能彌補前此三國談判的失敗，對於英法現在地位總有很大的裨益。而另一方面，像英大使克萊琪在東京和谷正之所進行的那種談判，在英國也許確具有不得已的苦衷，其究能收穫幾許成效仍屬疑問。且此種談判必不免關涉中國的主權和美國的輿情，稍一不慎，輒易引起磨擦或反感，其得失未必即能互相抵償。英國方以戢止侵略號召於世界，則必不容獨在遠東竟有違反其根本立塲的措施。與其鍥而不舍的執着於東京方面的談判，倒不如以全力促進英蘇關係的好轉，這無論在歐洲抑或遠東，其效果必非獲取日閥不可靠的些許然諾所能比擬。</p>

<p>今後問題更爲嚴重、國債已由本年初之八·一六三·〇〇〇·〇〇〇鎊、增至三月底之八·九三一·〇〇〇·〇〇〇鎊、政府不得已將於本年內隨時請求核准費用、而所請求之數爲公共利益計、僅列整數而不詳細區分各部經費、以免敵方獲知英國之添造新艦或增置空軍、本年第一次之請款爲七〇〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇鎊、已於三月十三日通過、但全年十二個月究需經費幾何、極難估定、在此戰爭之最初七個月內、戰費爲九〇五·〇〇〇·〇〇〇鎊、依此推算、十二個月約需一·五〇〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇鎊、然如此估計、殊不正確、因戰費現方日增、不　勢所必增、且亦理應增多也、故渠估計截至明年三月底止、僅戰費一項約需二·〇〇〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇鎊、渠於此二·〇〇〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇鎊外、尙須加上整理國債基金與民事經費、估計整理國債基金之撥款爲二四七·〇〇〇·〇〇〇鎊、而民事經費之尋常估計連民防在內、共爲四二〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇鎊、上述數字一併計之、共爲二·六六七·〇〇〇·〇〇〇鎊、此爲本屆年度所需之經費、公共支用之撙節問題、乃國內有識者常所關懷之事件、本國民眾爲最後勝利起見、當準備接受此項預算之擔負而無間言、因彼等當覺政府正竭力減除浪費、彼等所付者不過爲必要者耳云、</p>

<p>財相至是乃討論現有稅率繼續可收幾何之問題、估計可收死稅八五·〇〇〇·〇〇〇鎊、印花稅一九·〇〇〇·〇〇〇鎊、國防捐與逾額盈餘稅七〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇鎊、內地稅收以現有稅則爲根據、可收六五八·〇〇〇·〇〇〇鎊、比去年增七五·〇〇〇·〇〇〇鎊、關稅與出產稅上年收四〇〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇鎊、依此估計本年可收四二〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇鎊、汽車稅可收三五·〇〇〇·〇〇〇鎊、財相聲明政府已決定將郵局收入劃入財部之內、政府對於不景氣之實業自當予以考慮、政府鑒於戰時狀况、不得不展緩重行估定產業價值、以便徵收所得稅之舉、財政部提議修正立法案、以應付產業漏稅、關於關稅與出產稅、渠提議在兩點上製定立法案、第一爲改善出口貨給回金辦法、以扶助輸出貿易、第二與帝國糖優待辦法有關、使現有優待繼續至一九四二年八月底爲止、財相又稱、如照上年辦法、收入可得一·一三三·〇〇〇·〇〇〇鎊、然此總額有加稅增高之必要、故渠不得不注意於直接與間接兩稅、今後所得稅將由七先令增爲七先令六便士而常年收入在一千五百鎊以上者須征附加稅、電話捐增至百分之十五、批發商對零售商之售出、除人畜食物飲料燃料及重稅物品如烟草類外、皆將徵收按百計算之新稅、啤酒稅每品特增加一便尼、威士忌酒稅每瓶增加一先令九便士、烟草稅每磅增加四先令、火柴稅每籮爲五十便士、內地信件郵費增加一便尼、國外郵費增至三便士而非二便士半、標準酒精稅每介侖增加十五先令、共爲九十七先令六便士、</p>
<p>所得稅標準提高</p>
<p>財相於宣布擬將所得稅之標準由七先令增至七先令六便士並擬裁减所得稅减繳辦法時聲稱、增稅甚高、本國直接稅之担負較前爲高、一年之內、所得稅標準率已由五先令六便士增至七先令六便士、再加附稅、其竐高率將達每鎊十七先令、無論戰時或平時、此各稅率實爲前所未有、查一九一八年所得稅最高率僅六先令、連附稅計之亦不過每鎊十先令六便士耳、已婚而無子女者、如年有三百鎊收入、須付十五鎊所得稅、而非如上年之七鎊與前年之五鎊、而年賺四百磅者、須付所得稅三十鎊十二先令六便士、而非如上年之十七鎊十先令與前年之十二鎊十二先令六便士、凡年入六百鎊者、須繳所得稅九十二鎊十六先令六便士、而非如去年之七十三鎊十先令及前年之五十六鎊十二先令六便士、此項變更以及次要變更、可使本年直接稅產生四二·〇〇〇·〇〇〇鎊、以全年計之、可得六一·七五〇·〇〇〇鎊、附加稅中尙有一變更、即一九四〇至四一年凡一年收入超過一千五百鎊而非二千鎊者、即須繳附加稅是也、</p>
<p>間接稅較前大增</p>
<p>至於間接稅、啤酒稅從四月二十四日每品特增一便尼、全年可得一八·〇〇〇·〇〇〇鎊、而在本屆年度內可得一五·〇〇〇·〇〇〇鎊、法政府尤廢止其條約上權利、許運入英國之法國酒精得適用增稅、故自本日起、標準酒精每加侖增稅十五先令後、全年可得七·〇〇〇·〇〇〇鎊、而在本屆年度中、可得六·五〇〇·〇〇〇鎊、烟草稅從今日起、每鎊增稅四先令、好每盎斯增稅三便士、而雪茄等稅亦同樣增收、此物在一年內兩項加稅誠屬煩重、然在目前財政情形中、欲不加稅不可得也、估計烟草稅全年可增至二三·〇〇〇·〇〇〇鎊、而在本屆年度中可得二一·〇〇〇·〇〇〇鎊、火柴出產稅自四月二十九日起視前增倍、關稅亦如之、一盒火柴計五十根、其代價本爲一便尼者、今後將爲一便尼半、在本屆年度內、此稅可得三·五〇〇·〇〇〇鎊以上、而以全年計之、可得四·〇〇〇·〇〇〇鎊、而打火燈亦將酌量加稅、以言郵費、則所增者爲某種起點郵費、但超過重量之費則仍不變更、國內郵費增率如下、信件重不逾二盎斯者、由一便尼半增至二便士半、明信片由一便尼增至二便士、印刷品每件增半便尼、報紙增半便尼、國外郵費增率如下、信件由二便士半增至二便士、航空郵件不加費、估計郵費加後本屆年度可得一〇·四〇〇·〇〇〇鎊、全年可得一一·〇〇〇·〇〇〇鎊、國內電話費不論、營業用或公用、一律自五月一日起增加百分之一五、而私人電話費則增收百分之二五、此項在本屆年度可收二·〇〇〇·〇〇〇鎊、全年可收二·五〇〇·〇〇〇鎊、國內電報費自七月一日起、尋常或慶賀電報每次增收三便士、新聞電每頁亦增收三便士、私人電報增收百分之二五、此項約可在本屆年度收一六〇·〇〇〇鎊、全年二四〇·〇〇〇鎊、海外電報電話戰時當受限制、現不擬加價、在本屆年度可得一二·五〇〇·〇〇〇鎊、全年一四·五〇〇·〇〇〇鎊、</p>
<p>購買稅徵收辦法</p>
<p>財相至是言及一種新稅、謂各國及英屬自治領、多徵收種類各異之銷售稅、惟方法不同、今渠所提議者爲購買稅、按批發商售與零售商時之價格、照百分數徵收云、如此徵稅、有大便利處、即易於着手是、貨物供輸出用者不徵購買稅、政府一面推進增多輸出之運動、一面當限制國內非必要之糜費、實業所需之原料不適用購買稅、牛畜所需之食物與飲料、及已徵重稅、如烟草石油等之物品、或燃料·煤氣·電氣·與水等、亦皆免繳購買稅、關於此稅實施之日期與稅率、將由下院立法規定之、統計本年度特殊加稅之所入、共爲一〇一·〇〇〇·〇〇〇鎊、加以根據上年稅率而得之稅收一·一三三·〇〇〇·〇〇〇鎊、兩者共爲一·二三四·〇〇〇·〇〇〇鎊、如購買稅得以通過、則渠希望本年底亦可稍有所獲、惟本屆預算案之集中問題、較捐稅尤爲重要者、爲一·四三三·〇〇〇·〇〇〇鎊之鉅數、如何籌措耳、渠反對强迫國人節蓄其一部份入款之建議、渠以爲宜極端鼓勵國人以響應政府目前借債方法、如此定可收效、此種鉅款勢須籌措、政府於此必須改善可鼓勵自由對政府報効、並可避免通貨膨脹之狀况、任何計畫凡可襄助以限制銷費力濫用者皆屬重要、政府政策欲使必要的食物價格合理、雖此舉使國庫付多大代價亦所不惜、政府現年用六千萬鎊以抑低某種必要食物之價格、多種企業已被支配、而外匯亦被統制云、</p>
<p>逾額盈餘稅優點</p>
<p>財相言及逾額盈餘稅、謂逾額利潤如照股息自由分給、則將大失其價值、如用以扶助事業、並於戰局結束後困難時期內整理企業則極爲有益、但若散諸股東之手中、則徒引誘股東用之於銷耗耳、故渠提議以公司法限制股息、規定普通股息不得較戰前三年中之任何一年股息爲大、而近年不能發給股息之公司、則可許其酌發股息、爲使此計劃周密起見、渠提議戰時禁止發給紅利股票、惟兩公司合併有特殊理由者除外云、（眾歡呼）</p>
<p>英財相結束言論</p>
<p>財相末稱、本年渠所欲得之稅收、共達一·二三四·〇〇〇·〇〇〇鎊、此誠爲英國財政史中一年稅收之最大數字、然新式戰爭所致之支出既若是之龐大、捐稅自不得不與之偕高、依渠計算、本年較諸上年勢必多用至少八五·〇〇〇·〇〇〇鎊之經費、渠現擬多獲一八五·〇〇〇·〇〇〇鎊之稅收、試問結局將何如乎、節蓄及以節蓄借與國家兩事、必需比例的增加、此舉之應實現、乃英國作戰旨趣中之一重要部份、如國人始終維護目前借款、而繳納政府捐稅、則吾人無所慮矣、因吾人財政陣綫亦猶在奮鬥求勝中其他陣綫之堅固也云、（眾歡呼）</p>
<p>反對黨陳述意見</p>
<p>工黨領袖阿特里評論西門所發之預算言論、對於啤酒酒精烟草火柴之增稅表示贊同、但以爲郵稅未必能產生多大進款、而反使多數人民怨憤耳、西門贊成自動儲蓄而反對强迫儲蓄之主張、亦爲渠所歡迎、自由領袖辛克萊稱、西門陳述預算難題、至爲明顯、無人可責備具所擬辦法之過於嚴苛、德國本年以二·三〇〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇鎊用於戰事、而法國人民現所作之努力、較諸西門所請求於英人者更大、渠以爲西門已以英國財力偉大之明證示諸下院、而下院之接受其提議、亦可證團結一致志在必勝的英國之高尙精神與堅强旨趣云、（廿三日路透電）</p>

<p>麵粉　昨市二號粉廠盤仍為十三元八角、市面環境、已不若前兩日之活絡、且客銷淸淡、銀根暗緊、米價回小、本街進胃亦懈、囤戶更鮮垂靑、故回籠貨已逐見鬆疲、老車棧單價為十三元七角四分、雙獅牌十三元四角三四分、市面均吿平疲、統市各粉成交祇六七千包、</p>
<p>小麥　目下現粉實銷平淡、華廠吃盤頗為重視、而貨方終以國麥到存兩枯、不願過於遷就、聞福阜兩廠送廠貨的有五六百包、最高價作為三十一元、其中關貨二十元〇七八角、市呈平庸之局、惟市傳又降小數角之說、其交易尙未妥實也、</p>

<p>紗市續升、趨勢尙緊、但有一部份因具連漲三日、獲利者稍有出籠、致檯面鬆懈而回平、此種情形、應有的現象也、惟一般經濟寬紓者、吸收之額堅不放棄、因現貨抽空之故也、</p>
<p>現紗晨開人氣承上日熱烈之勢而續進、二十支雙馬廠單為一千四百七十元、但現貨辦要不旺、市象帮疲、頃刻間跌去十元、廠單價為一千四百五十元、然低價　戶又起、回升亦迅速、廠單一　間漲至一千四百七十九元、迨至收盤略弱、查半日間成交統計一千六百六十五包、行情二十支雙馬現貨漲十元、今日有二百七十件　港、茲將各帮口買去之額量列左、</p>

<p>另訊外棉市價、紐約棉市、晨初殊為堅定而活潑、後因購買者踴躍、及一部份空頭抵補而漲、華爾街之高昂影響棉市頗力、結果收盤市况堅定、較之上日近遠期俱漲三四磅音、印度昨連同預測漲一羅比、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、因市上銀根奇緊、故交易稍見靜寂、然售價却始終高昂、除有一部份同業、因銀根關係、本月份匯票必須出貨者、祗能廉價斬出、聞昨日米　林一時成交價為二九五元、殊為廉宜、一般預料五月中棉價將大漲也、茲將昨日棉市以美匯六元折合送廠如下、</p>

<p>美國亞洲艦隊司令赫德上將、昨日在美國旗艦奧古斯泰號上、曾接見西報記者、赫德上將對於美國在關島設防、作為海軍根據地之意見、表示完全同意、一般人或有加以懷疑者、關於此點、赫德上將認為如砍維持關島原狀、設防之事、實有加緊實施之必要蓋此與美國維持太平洋原有狀態之政策　符合也、</p>
<p>荷印局勢未可逆暏</p>
<p>記者又詢以如　屬東印度問題不得解決、而荷印勢將被侵犯時、美亞洲艦隊當採何種措置、目前是否已擬有計劃、以應付未來之緊急局勢、關於此點、赫德上將含笑不答、叩之冉三、始稱、「目前尙難預料、余雅不願作預測也、」</p>
<p>美艦多艘集中上海</p>
<p>關於美國海軍之　個政策、赫德氏亦不願加以洩露、惟渠表示、美海軍在最近之將來、必有適當之措置、渠將作專文、以討論此事、又稱自奧古斯泰號旗艦駛滬後、美艦集中滬濱、巳有多艘、但在最近、仍有若干艘將由菲　駛滬、其中一部駛往華北、父稱、目前斯于的那維亞半島戰事、決不致影響及美國亞洲艦隊、但如戰爭侵及菲島領海、美國海軍對之、自將採必要措施、</p>
<p>珠江限制並未取消</p>
<p>論及珠江開放問題時、上將稱、據傳珠江雖稱開放、日軍之各種限制、並未取消、且對外艦之往來、仍予限制，關於此點、渠表示在未加巡視之前、不願發表任何意見、但指明美國在華南如廣州一帶之貿易、就目前之情形言、仍可樂觀、</p>
<p>菲人對於獨立見解</p>
<p>關於菲島獨立問題、上將稱菲島人士、對此問題之意見、的可分為兩種，一般菲人對奎松總統雖深表愛戴、但彼等又深恐菲島一旦宣吿獨立、而脫離美國之保護、將遭遇意外危機、另一般人則認獨立無冒險性、而對上述之杞憂、表示懷疑、至於菲島之農民、渠認為自幼即受充分之自治訓練矣、渠又稱、菲島唯一近海之防綫、即為馬尼刺海灣、就軍事上觀察、渠認為固定之防務、不足以勝保衛之任、蓋面積太大、非藉海軍之力、不能為功也、</p>
<p>今明兩日檢閱官兵</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、美國亞洲艦隊總司令赫德、定一十五與二十六兩日，循例視察駐滬美第四海軍陸戰隊員工作及營房、其程序為二十五日晨九時、在跑馬廳檢閱該隊全體官兵、然後視察各兵營及官佐辦公室、二十六日晨、復檢閱該隊演習、赫德大將視察時、將由司令部各軍官伴同調查陸戰隊種種活動、</p>
<p>駐菲専員明晚歡讌</p>
<p>美駐菲專員塞爾偕其夫人、於二十二日乘美國亞洲艦隊旗艦奧古斯泰號抵滬、當日即與先期抵滬之赫德上將會晤、茲據確訊塞氏復定明日下午八時、假華懋飯店歡宴赫德上將及在滬美國方面要員、如長江艦隊司令格拉斯福少將、按察使海爾密克。代理美國駐滬總領白忒力克等、按塞爾行將於二十八日啟程赴日、訪晤格魯大使、據稱、氏此行目的、在加强美政府與駐外使節之聯系、故衆信塞爾氏此次與在滬美國亞洲艦隊司令及其他要員之聯歡、其用意亦頗深遠、</p>

<p>墩澳形勢極便停船</p>
<p>墩澳位於東經二度以西、即北緯五十一度之北、居英海口沱市Dover之東北、東受佳氏沙灘GoodwinSands之迥護、而西阻英海岸、極便停船、外船之駛入墩澳、乃憑燈號浮標為嚮導、並賴其他標誌、指明停泊地點、此外向東直達法國領海界、水雷密布、凡出入大西洋與北海間之海面者、別無他路可行、</p>
<p>審查檢騐需時甚久</p>
<p>外船為防過多時日之　延、原可先將一切貨物之單據、飛送倫敦、先請主管機關、加以詳核、但如卸貨處所或運送方向、發見可疑之點、一經由該主管機關、轉送英國經濟抗戰部審查、便須引起更久之滯留、是以歐亞非美間海上郵信之往還、與夫郵政包件之由水道寄遞在此歐戰期中、至少必須延遲一個月以上、香港與歐洲之郵件交通、反不如上海寄由俄國西行者之較為便捷</p>
<p>華商携眷紛紛歸國</p>
<p>向來販運國　入歐洲之山東幫殷　商賈、紛携眷屬、輟業離歐、其自歐洲啟程之中國僑民、為避英國墩澳海上　關之困阻、大抵　乘火車往法國、或往義國、然後再從地中海岸、買棹放洋、此為一九三九年九月以來海上交通之特殊狀態、我國內之商家及旅客、所應徹底明瞭其眞相者也、</p>

<p>全國轟動之弒父逆倫巨案、初審判決、逆子周欽吉·周欽祥·共同殺害直系血親尊親屬、各處死刑、其母周經氏幫助毀尸體、處徒刑二年六月、因各犯不服判決、廷楊凜知·葉少英·楊思誠·三律師、　周經氏則延姜肨藩·蔣葆盩律師、向高二分院提起上訴、並以上訴人等均患有遺傳性之精神病症、對於法醫之鑑定報告、談爲不滿、請求再行指定別家鑑定、各情已　本報、此案昨日午後又屆　二次　合　庭訊　之期、庭址仍　第一特院　　江路刑庭</p>
<p>三庭審理到庭旁聽之男女極爲擁擠、未屆二時、庭爲之滿、女主角周欽珠身穿藍色旗袍、外罩綠色短大衣、足蹬白色皮鞋、態度安祥、偕親戚默坐於旁聽席上、特院之中西司法警察亦全部出動、分佈於法庭內外、凡遇無旁聽券者、則均在被擯之例、二時半捕房律師甘鏡先·上訴人代理律師葉少英·楊思誠·姜屏藩·均準時到案、審判長聶重義乃偕石美喻·賈振聲兩推事·及林我朋檢察官升座、首向上訴人周欽祥略訊一過、繼據見證歸人楊</p>
<p>浦氏投稱吳江人、年三十歲、去年六月間至周家爲傭、直至出事後、由小姐（即周欽珠）辭歇、當在周家服務時、除收拾房間外、並幫助太太（周經氏）燒飯煮菜、我之臥室在樓上亭子間、距死者臥室甚遠、故彼等如有談話等等、不能聞見、此次老爺（周永杰）因何被殺、不得而知、太太平日　晨十時下樓、因　患有心臟病、故終日逗留於灶披間內、直至夜間十時始上樓、是晚我於十時就寢後、翌晨五時起身、因不見老爺、據小阿官（周欽吉）聲稱、父親已於夜半出門去矣、</p>
<p>餘事不知至此聶推事乃裁定關於上訴人方面聲稱行鑑定之全文曰、「聲請駁回」、並以事實明瞭、諭令開始辯論、首由工部局代理律師甘鏡先起稱、查本案上訴人周欽吉·欽祥·關於殺人及毀尸部份、證據確實、緣本案犯罪情形、與事實均屬相符、業經捕房對於上訴人等採購物件之店鋪等等、均曾詳加調查、由兩上訴人共同選購、皆有明證、毫無可疑、至其年齡問題、於上訴審理中忽然皆縮小三歲、不知是何用意、要知刑法上有明文規定、凡未滿十八歲者、對於殺害直系尊親屬之眾、根本不適用、至於　主張之精神病亦經</p>
<p>法醫騐明與常人無異、而無心神喪失狀態、是其犯罪之動機、不衹限於因虐待其母而起、因死者薄有財產、上訴人等於死者死後、即盜竊仔摺錢財、含有謀財害命之情形、按照强盜殺人罪刑而論、亦應處以極刑、况本案情節重大、殺害直系血親尊親屬、並支解尸體、意圖毀尸滅跡、大逆不道、興國共忿、在貴院成立以來、案屬創見、情實可惡、我國素以禮教爲重、此　科學新法、以電流殺人之逆倫巨案、揆諸法律人情、均無可恕之處、至周經氏部份、原審以其有幫助</p>
<p>毀尸情形處刑二年六月、已屬　外施情、罪減一等、應請駁回上訴、維持原判云云、繼由上訴人代理葉少英律師　稱、關於上訴人周欽吉部份、原審對於此部份認定事實之根據有　、（一）周欽吉之供單、（二）共犯周欽祥之陳述、　供單並非根據直接訊問所記錄之自白、其性質與刑法二七〇條之規定顯有不符、查本案在上訴開庭時、周欽吉始終否認彼曾參預謀殺、而其弟周欽祥則直認此案爲其個人所爲、捕房亦不能證明欽吉有同謀情事、應請宣告無罪、至周欽　　份、</p>
<p>自白供認犯罪事實、但其究竟有無精神病一點、據法醫鑑定書末一段報告、每謂有低級精神病、本律師、再聲請重行鑑定、未蒙照准、是其對於犯罪事實、雖未依法得减輕其刑云云又由上訴人代理楊思誠律師繼起辯論、謂、關於刑法罪名列舉有三十五種之多、依犯罪統計學觀察、殺人案雖不敢謂最少、然亦未見其多、至殺死直系尊親屬尤屬絕無僅有、推其原因、因人類之愛、莫過於父母子女、因子女是父母精神上之寄託者、物質上之繼承者、衹有愉快、而無利害衝突、因此社會上殺一尋常人可以漠不相關、對於殺死尊親屬即認爲</p>
<p>天翻地覆、此種態度、是國人充分表露數千年來百善孝爲先之善良倫理精神、再以法律規定而論、殺死尋常人與尊親屬同爲殺人罪名、其處刑輕重不同、尤其犯罪年齡、刑法第六十三條規定凡未滿十六歲者、犯罪不得處死刑或無期徒刑而獨對於殺死尊親屬、則限制其適用、可見立法重孝、不過現行刑法對於殺死尊親屬並非如舊刑法採取絕對死刑、尙有無期徒刑爲選擇刑之規定、查刑法五十七條規定、對於犯人犯罪之動機、目的及品行生活狀况、智識程度、均須</p>
<p>加以注意、本案表面上殺死被害人雖屬上訴人、其實造成本案的結果、不是上訴人、而爲被害人、且被害人之死、不是殺死、而爲病死、如果問是何病、（一）經神病、（二）不良的婚姻病、關於死者有無經神病　點、可從其生前待人接物種種方面觀察出來、且歷次開審、上訴人等之證言及上次證人陳人美等之供詞、均稱死者脾氣惡劣、　眾不問、夫妻父子形同冰炭、此種偕屬神經病現象、至婚姻不良滿、資上訴人周經氏與死者感情惡劣、爲親友共知、動輒毆罵、在奉大男有姘婦、上訴人周欽吉等供、周經氏因心臟病吃粥、死者偏要她吃飯、周經氏因病要關窗、死者偏要開窗、</p>
<p>諸如此類、不一而足、結婚二十年、從無好感、現在大家都痛恨上訴人手段殘忍卑鄙、原審處以死刑、毫無不合、但我們還有人類同情性的話、也得說一句公平話、他們是死者二種病所造成、冷酷家庭的犧牲者、不是破壞者、因爲人生在世、均有慾望、其最低限度想達到生存滿足、今上訴人之家庭遭遇冷酷、且有可怕之父親、形處地獄、樂趣毫無、而母親又遭虐待、大有不能生存之概、爲欲拯救母親、乃不惜採取不正當手段、造成本案之動機、</p>
<p>應請酌减徒刑云云、又由周經氏之辯護律師姜屏藩辯稱、原審對於氏因有幫助損毀尸體處刑、其所採取之重要證據、即在氏身畔抄得洋臺鑰匙一把、查捕房探員前往敲門時、上訴人周欽吉等即下樓開門、其時洋臺門根本未鎖、且周經氏在樓下灶披間被捕、根本無幫助毀尸之情事、應請宣告無罪云云、聶推事核供、諭本案辯論終結、定期本月三十日下午二時宣告判決、上訴人等仍分別還押、</p>

<h3 id="c110">為人類造福的醫生 <a href="#c110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>— 周戊</p>
<p>近代霤學的進展，減少了病人的痛苦，並叮用種種的預防方法使疾病不致傳染，以前所不能治的疾病，現在也有新的方法來治療，可使患病者健復。這對於近代的人類是一種極大的幸福。給人類這種幸福的是孜孜於實騐室中的醫學者，和仁心救世為人類服務的醫生以及護士們。</p>
<p>我們對於這一般人應該是至為欽仰，敬佩與感謝的。文明都市中死亡率的遂年減低，息病者的逐年減少，這都是他們努力的結果。</p>
<p>間或，我們從傳記或旁的書本上看到似們中畢生的事蹟，其司敬的意志和精一神，足夠使我們神往久之，銘記終身。不久以前，有兩張影片在滬開映，將兩位醫生畢生苦鬥的事實搬上銀幕，我看後更是深深地感動。這兩張影片是：『衛城訖』和『光榮的回憶』。</p>
<p>這兩者之中，尤其是後者對我的印象更深刻。這位醫生苦幹幾十年，專為貧苦的民衆服務，不貪利，不顧誹謗，力行其是；其仁慈傳愛和堅忍不屈的精神，挪足以﹃光被四表』，而永垂不朽。，</p>
<p>回顧我國，醫術的落後且不要說起，這種精神就幾乎可設是『把無僅有」。當然，外國也儘多濟祇求牟利的醫者，掛了牌，定了價，等出得起診費的病人來求醫，並不是自動的東奔西走，來為病人服務。但是為什麼不和這般偉大的醫生來作比，來競爭呢？</p>
<p>在近付的社會中，最良好的臀生並不紙是醫術高明和備有完善器械的醫生，而是有仁慈博愛之心，肯為他人服務的登生。他們隨時隨地關心着社會大衆的身必康健，是他們給予近代人類最大的幸福。</p>
<p>國外，各城市村鎮中，現在多有公立醫院的設立，或者是專為貧民造福的私人所設的醫院。醫術高明的醫生也大多自願入院工作，寗可自己的收益少些；但精神上卻比較快活得多，因為有許多素不相識的病人，在背後感謝他們，祝頌他們。</p>
<p>中國雖然也有幾個這種醫院，但比起來實在太少了。何況我們民衆的體格不如外人，患病的比率要多於他們幾倍，所以絕不敷用。</p>
<p>以前有一次，我在學校中踤了一交，跌破了手上的皮，流着血，而傷口還帶着些泥灰。我因為離家較速，且校中還有課，但恐隔久了，弄了體進去要發炎，所以跑到附近一家務院去，想請醫生洗一洗，搽一點藥水。這手續祇要化二分鐘的功夫就可弄妥，而且藥水等的咸本亦不過二角；但他們一定要收我、一元二角的醫藥費，結果我可寗談它發炎而沒有洗。後來總算好了，不會發炎。</p>
<p>這一次的經歷，更使我覺得『光榮的回憶』中的那老醫生的偉大。</p>
<p>本來，為人類服務是醫生的天職，但現在，為人類服務的醫生然算是坡良好的醫生了。</p>
<p>不過，專以牟利為止的的翳生是要被淘汰的，像以前的『御醫』二樣。</p>

<p>據美國統計，以下九項情形，佔着美國人長死亡原因的百分之七十二：</p>
<p>（一）心臟病。</p>
<p>（二）性感冒與肺炎。</p>
<p>（三）產疽與惡性　瘍。</p>
<p>（四）腎臟發炎。</p>
<p>（五）腦出血與腦髓變軟。</p>
<p>（六）肺結核。</p>
<p>（七）小孩生來畸形，或出生不久即受病菌侵窖。</p>
<p>（八）為汽車輾斃，或遭遇其他意外之事。</p>
<p>（九）糖尿病。</p>
<p>其中佔着第一把交椅的心臟病，對於人頹實在是一個非常可怕的劊子手，美國在一九三七年死於心臟病者就有三四六，四〇一人。六十歲左右的人，有百分之三十三一，九因息心臟病血死亡，它對於十歲到十四歲男孫子的威脅，只有第八項情形和官腸炎能和它相頡頏。</p>

<h3 id="c112">癩蝦蟆有功人世 <a href="#c112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>— 放任</p>
<p>提起了癩蝦蟆三字，誰不要搖頭蹙額，馬上想到牠的醜態。但偏是這人們嘲笑的對象，卻能責獻出牠的生命，為人類的生命增加一重保障。因為醫藥界最近已發現牠所分泌的毒液可洽癌症，而且已試騐成功了。</p>
<p>大概是一年以前，法國柯乃柳醫生發表他的實騐結果，說癩蝦嶼—即蟾蜍—項下一腺所分泌的毒液，可以幫助人體紙抗痛癥病。但在那時，大部份的人還不肯置信，未予注意。直到最近，免毒劑研究所始承認柯乃柳醫生的實騐結果，確乎是實右的。原來該所對於抵抗癌症的研究，在十二年前，己由研究員裴龍開始進行。祗因為尚未獲得事實上的根據，此一向保待緘默而已。</p>
<p>裴龍氏的研究，係先由檢查動物是否也生癌症着手。經過長時間的實騐，他發現蛇也有生此症的，而前後檢騐了四干條蝰蛇（毒蛇之一种），居然沒有一條生法最輕微的癌症。此外，他又檢騐三千隻癩蝦蟆和一千八百隻青蛙。結果，有幾十隻青蛙患着此症，而癩蝦蟆肌像蝰蛇一樣，沒有一雙患有此症。根據了上述的實馳，裴能乃認為蛙蛇和癥蝦蟆的毒液，實為抵抗癥症的良藥，又因為後者所分泌的功效尤大，才決定專用牠來試製治療癌症的抗毒劑。</p>
<p>現在提製的試騐業巳完成，因此該所也發表結果，認為與柯乃柳醫生的實騐相合。據說此種用蝦蟆毒液提製成的注射劑，不但能治療各種癌症，而且有強心，保持神經系平衡，和刺激腺體等功效。</p>
<p>癩蝦蟆的毒液可以入藥，中国的醫藥界實在早巳發現過了。據辭源和辭海的记載，它的名字叫「蟾酥」。並轉錄本草上所說的製法如下：「取蟾酥之法不一。或以手揑其眉稜，取白汁；或以蒜及胡椒等辣物纳其口中，则蟾身自白汁目出。以竹　刮下，麪和成塊乾之，可入藥。」但不曾說主治何症。後來筆者託人去問一位國營，據他轉告說：「蟾酥不入藥方，惟常用於丸散內，如辟瘟丹之類。故係輔助劑，功效雖多，而無單用之者」云。</p>
<p>不過無論中國醫藥界是否為先發現者，照筆者所已知道的而論，大概還只是初步發明的原型，而沒有作更進一步的研究。現在別人家旣已研究得更清楚更精明，那就讓人家去後來居上也罷。可是以後，筆者很希望國內的業物研究專家也同樣注意注意國藥。如果龍尋到像「蟾酥」那樣的綫案，再進而改良之，豈不比拾人牙慧，但求縣錢的工作更有意思，更有價值嗎？</p>

<h3 id="c113">裸體幼稚教育 <a href="#c113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>— 清</p>
<p>世界的教育理論，近幾年來，不但有顯著的進步，並且因了人類文明的進展與科學生活的發逹，許多從前人認為是大膽的，空想的教育方法，現在都能夠得到一個實騐的機會。</p>
<p>倫敎的裸體幼稚園，便是挅用這種教宵理論，使天眞活潑的兒童，打破人體的曖昧，利用天然環境—日光，空氣，水—給他們以完全康健快樂的生活教育。</p>
<p>這個裸體幼稚園，完全以「自由康健」為主要的教育目標，他們的課程標準，雖與世界各國的幼稚教育相差無幾，然而教育方式，卻是十分新奇的。他們沒有刻版的上課時間，不用死版的課本。學生都可以自由選擇他們自已所喜歡的書冊，作為智識課本。</p>
<p>除了日常的起居飲食有一定的秩序外，其他的生活是非常自由的，每個學生進校之後，都可以讓他選擇一件自己所愛的教育玩具，這件玩具，無論他獨自玩弄，或集體遊戲，都聽自已的自由，敎師的任務，祇是在旁擔任照顧的責任，可是一到適當的時侯，就隨時隨地把生活智識與學問灌輸給他們，談他們在不知不覺中受到良好的教育。</p>
<p>據專家們的研究，道種教育的戴大優點，不但能增進兒實的體力與皮膚抵抗力，並且在智力上，也有極大的好處。</p>
<p>同時，兒童時代的感受性是特別強的，如果在小學年齡之前，給他們一個人體的坦白光明的概念，可以打破將來對於人體的暖昧心理。</p>

<p>今日的世界，是一个瘋人院，其中充滿響聲，不安定，和無意義的鼓噪。現代的生活，是這樣的複雜，是這樣的忽忙，一般的人，被白常事務的狂潮，沖向前行，幾不自知其所以。人們拚命的等樂，盲目的追逐羣衆，作奇想犧牲。一個家庭，不再是他的宮殿，無缐電播音，優入到他的座居報告天下一切事，從生意買賣，直到睡眠床上的笑話故事，便家庭之內，充滿一切。所以，今日的世界，極難做的一件事，就是我得一間小小的幽靜居室。生命是在高速度的運行，人們只想到新聞紙上的標題，並受其神經或術動所緒制，簡直沒有時候思想，不從自己的意見，想到某種合乎理性的結論。因為有了這樣的　雜，紛亂，忽忙，缺乏清明而寬宏的思想，於是現代的人生，便太過於者重物質的價值。我們儡於相信，好人最顯著的標誌，是他們有了多大的財產，或銀行中有多大的款。許多的發明，和大量的生產，使過多的貨物，堆積在我們面前，致令我們常看一個人所有的豐富財產，為他成功的標識。如其批評家所說的，「賣化員說，家庭生活的成功有賴於每年春季購買一部新車，又千訴我們，省工的發明，一定使我們快樂，時裝衣服，可以補人品的缺點，你所需要的，是革種家具，把你的家庭，點綴成滿意的家庭。」像這樣廣告的活，必定使人覺着如自己有充足的物質，必然快樂無窮我們在這吶雜紛亂之中，以羣衆的思想為思想，忘卻了自己的自信，並且一般的接受這樣的理想，就是從財產上去看人的成敗，那知這種觀念，將將得勢，我們即遭　受到歷史上的極大的經濟不景氣，銀行倒了，股票市塲崩潰了，物質機構破壞了，於是這句宗敎的老話，「人的生命，不在他所有財產的豐富，」又向世人發射出真理之光了。接着這經濟不景氣，我們又看出一種精神的不景氣，就是；人們自己騙自己，要自己信服，用安樂方法法，可使生命偉大，用舒適方法，可使生命高貴，具有錢財，比用自己力去賺更要緊，娛樂高於尊敬和德備。人們彼此不相信，不信誰人的人格，於自己守會制度的價値，亦表懷疑。</p>

<p>琴逑羅吉絲說：「無論為了藝術方面或者因為工作方面，要我去向一個有着硬韌而觸膚的鬍鬚的這類人物接吻，我總是不願的。」</p>
<p>安秀麗丹說：「從純眞的藝術上來觀察，同一個有鬍鬚不論是希特勒式的或者是卓別林式人物接吻，我認為是一件辱恥的工作。」</p>
<p>白蓓蘭史丹薇對於這個間題不發表任何意見，但她這樣的吿訴瑪克斯：「因為我　着一張極怕癢的上脣，所以，在遇到鬍鬚這類東西時，常　使我發出一種無情的微笑；為了這個緣故，導演者總小讓我去接吻有着鬍鬚的男星。」</p>

<h3 id="e11">British-Soviet Negotiations and British-Japanese Negotiations <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>Among the belligerent countries in Europe today, Britain's situation is perhaps the most complex and delicate. On one hand, it leads the war against Germany, becoming the main target of German attacks and bearing the responsibility of safeguarding security in various parts of Europe. On the other hand, with its territory spread across the globe, it must consider the connection between the home country and its colonies and the preservation of its overseas interests. It is certainly not easy for the British Empire, under the convergence of these heavy obligations and difficulties, to manage everything smoothly and appropriately. Therefore, we cannot overly demand or blame Britain's foreign policy at this time for failing to fully meet our expectations. At the same time, we also hope that the British authorities can be firm and self-respecting, and properly handle their internal and external problems, so that they can consider both the current practical interests and the basic principles proclaimed in this war.</p>
<p>The wars in the Far East and Europe are still continuing, and all rights and wrongs, merits and demerits must be left to future history to judge. However, if we briefly review Britain's foreign measures over the past year, it is not difficult to find that its diplomatic relations with both the Soviet Union and Japan are inevitably marked by major errors and regrets. Regarding the failure of the tripartite negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union last year, the detailed circumstances have not yet been fully known, and commentators have different views, each with their own observations. However, judging from the evolution of events, the failure of that negotiation was an important fuse for the outbreak of this war and a major blow to Britain and France. After the failure of the negotiations, the Soviet Union's advance into Poland and the outbreak of the Soviet-Finnish War further deteriorated British-Soviet relations, almost forming a direct confrontation, thereby further promoting the alliance between the Soviet Union and Germany. If peace between the Soviet Union and Finland had not been achieved precisely before the European war spread to Denmark and Norway, the turmoil in Northern Europe would have intensified, forming a mixed war that would have further increased the difficulties for Britain and France. Looking further at British-Japanese relations, although British interests have been greatly infringed upon in the past two or three years and British public opinion is filled with support for China and opposition to Japan, the government's policy towards Japan has always tended towards leniency and compromise, from the Shanghai Customs Agreement at the end of 1938 to the intermittent Tokyo negotiations from last summer to the present. The result, however, has been nothing more than greater threats and more insults. Looking at the recent angry voices of British residents in Tianjin under blockade, the constant questioning of the British House of Commons on the policy towards Japan, and the awkwardness of the diplomatic authorities' evasive words, it can be seen that Britain's diplomacy towards Japan today, like its policy towards the Soviet Union, needs to be seriously reconsidered.</p>
<p>Since Britain expanded its blockade against Germany, the commercial relations between Germany and the Soviet Union and the commercial relations passing through the Soviet Union to reach Germany in the Pacific have become a serious problem. For Britain and France, this is a gap that must be plugged, and it is also a difficult hurdle intertwined with some complex diplomatic relations. This may be the key to whether Britain and France are friends or foes with the Soviet Union, and it may also be seen by the Japanese clique as a good opportunity to extort Britain and France. It was recently rumored that Britain was preparing to extend the blockade against Germany to the Far East, with Vladivostok as the most important target. Fortunately, Britain and France have not acted so recklessly and destructively, otherwise, they may have made an irreparable mistake, allowing the aggressors in the East to reap the benefits. In fact, the key to blocking the loophole in Germany's northeast border lies solely with the Soviet Union, and Britain and France have no need to seek help from the Japanese side. Moreover, the goods and equipment imported into Germany from the Pacific via Siberia are limited, and the frequent transshipments and high costs do not greatly help Germany. The sea and land transportation routes are all within Soviet territory, and only the Soviet Union has the power to manipulate them. Therefore, the nature of British-Soviet relations will be a major key to the future evolution of the European war. To strive for compromise with the Japanese clique while letting diplomacy with the Soviet Union take its course, whether this is due to the influence of ideological systems or the separation from the reality of facts, cannot be considered a sound policy in light of the national interests of Britain and France in extraordinary times.</p>
<p>Although political negotiations between Britain and the Soviet Union have become a thing of the past, the door to commercial negotiations has always been open. Looking at the repeated urgings of Soviet Ambassador Maisky to Britain, it can be seen that the Soviet Union does not want British-Soviet relations to continue to deteriorate. Now that this negotiation has just begun, it is not appropriate to place extravagant hopes on it immediately, but Britain must not neglect its importance and continue to let it drift in indifference. If the Allied powers can calmly and carefully consider how to improve relations with the Soviet Union, then even if they cannot make up for the failure of the previous tripartite negotiations, it will be of great benefit to the current position of Britain and France. On the other hand, the kind of negotiations that British Ambassador Craigie is conducting with Tani Masayuki in Tokyo may indeed have unavoidable difficulties for Britain, and it is still questionable how much success it can achieve. Moreover, this kind of negotiation will inevitably involve China's sovereignty and American public opinion, and the slightest carelessness can easily cause friction or resentment, and its gains and losses may not be mutually compensatory. Since Britain is calling on the world to curb aggression, it must not allow measures that violate its fundamental position to occur in the Far East. Rather than persistently clinging to the negotiations in Tokyo, it would be better to devote all efforts to promoting the improvement of British-Soviet relations. This, whether in Europe or the Far East, will have an effect that cannot be compared with obtaining unreliable promises from the Japanese clique.</p>

<p>Chongqing: American writer Ms. Agnes Smedley, who traveled with the Chinese guerrillas in central China for 18 months, declared to reporters from the United Press here today that Japan would never be able to rule the occupied areas of China, let alone conquer the whole of China. Ms. Smedley pointed out that in the year and a half since the fall of Hankou, the Japanese have only controlled the roads and walled cities. Ms. Smedley also said that she once followed a certain Chinese guerrilla unit to attack Hankou. Ms. Smedley arrived here last week. She served as a Red Cross member behind Japanese lines last August. According to her, the morale of the Japanese army had already been greatly lost last year. Currently, when the Chinese army attacks, the Japanese army always adopts a defensive posture. The Japanese army never dared to easily leave its defensive positions with only a small number of people unless they formed a large unit of hundreds of people, supplemented by full armament and heavy artillery. The Japanese are most afraid of fighting the Chinese in hand-to-hand combat. She also said that Japanese soldiers who behaved well did not know the truth. The Japanese army never failed to burn and plunder every village they went to. Ms. Smedley also criticized the United States for supplying the Japanese army with ammunition, saying that she felt sympathetic to the Chinese soldiers and civilians when she saw American-made bombs dropped by Japanese planes and Japanese planes burning American gasoline. Ms. Smedley made significant contributions to the organization and improvement of the armies in Anhui, Henan, and Hunan provinces. Ms. Smedley also said that the officers of the Guangxi army made a large contribution to the mobilization of the armies in those provinces. After leaving Anhui, Ms. Smedley also joined a guerrilla unit in northern Hubei. That guerrilla unit received much support from the people in its battles in Hubei, and the entire army showed a strong and unified image. The guerrillas in northern Hubei were not subsidized by the National Government, but they were still able to defeat the puppet army and prevent the Japanese army from venturing outside the city, even though they were poorly equipped.

<h3 id="e20">Japanese Person Ito's Commentary: American Naval Plan - Exerting Utmost Effort to Increase the Cruising Range of New Warships, Considering the Japanese Naval Zone as a Target for Operations <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo – Ito, a renowned Japanese naval critic, recently published an article in the Japan Chronicle commenting on the American naval plan, stating approximately: The main objective of the new and under-design warships of the United States is to exert the utmost effort to increase their cruising range, so that they can adopt an offensive stance thousands of miles away. The reason is that the country regards the Western Pacific as nothing less than a hypothetical battlefield. The Craven-class destroyers among the country's newly built warships all have the possibility of operating in the waters near Japan. Their displacement is 1,500 tons, and their cruising range reaches 6,000 miles. This kind of "attack fleet" can be supplied with military supplies from the Pacific naval base, such as Wake Island and Midway Island, and can operate for more than a week following Japan's major trade routes before returning to join the main fleet without any difficulty. Given that their mere destroyers have a cruising range comparable to that of the battleships of the Washington Naval Conference era, the capabilities of other warships can be imagined. In terms of general naval strategy, if fifteen battleships cross the ocean for operations, at least ninety destroyers are required to cover them. Japan is paying attention to the American destroyer construction plan, believing that the country's navy is targeting the Western Pacific, that is, the "Japanese naval zone," for operations, and this is the reason. As for the American heavy cruisers, those stipulated to be built in the Vinson Naval Expansion Act also have "remarkable achievements." In short, the newly built battleships, cruisers, and destroyers of the United States all have a common characteristic, that is, the cruising range of each ship is very large. As for whether there are other weaknesses, let's not discuss them for now. Japan's newly built warships are unwilling to sacrifice firepower to increase cruising range. This proves that Japan's strategy is to engage in defense in the Western Pacific, with no intention of crossing the Pacific for operations. (Havas News Agency dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>Washington – New York Republican Representative Fish yesterday condemned Rear Admiral Taussig, commander of the Fifth Naval District, for his statement to the Senate Naval Committee, saying it was "the most provocative and dangerous tone uttered by any naval officer today." Fish proposed that Congress should investigate the statements made by naval officers regarding war, "Whenever a naval program is proposed, they always launch a propaganda campaign. Taussig even told us that we should fortify the Philippines and Guam, and join the Anglo-French Allied Powers to defend Singapore." Recently, Japanese Ambassador to Washington Kensuke Horinouchi visited Secretary of State Hull yesterday, introducing Aisuke Kabayama, chairman of the Japan International Cultural Relations Society. They both denied discussing the new immigration bill for the Philippines, the problem of the Dutch East Indies, or Taussig's statement. Also, Libby, chairman of the National Council for Prevention of War, said yesterday that Chief of Naval Operations Stark "attempted to intimidate the United States and fabricate the story of Japan's powerful naval shipbuilding program in order to build a naval force beyond our needs." He said that this kind of argument, like that of Rear Admiral Taussig, is most likely to drag the United States into war. (United Press dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>Tokyo – When the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs received reporters today, someone asked about Rear Admiral Taussig's statement at the Senate Naval Committee hearing on April 22, which considered a war between the United States and Japan as inevitable.

The spokesperson also recounted his experience of attending the U.S. Senate Naval Committee meeting, saying that these kinds of hearing meetings often express patriotic opinions on the extreme necessity of expanding the U.S. Navy to cover the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans.

<p>Washington - According to official sources, U.S. Ambassador to Japan Grew lodged a verbal protest with the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding the intensification of the blockade of Tianjin, following the instructions of the U.S. government. The reason for the protest was that the intensified blockade obstructs the freedom of movement of American people. (Haitong News Agency dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - When the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs received reporters today, he was asked whether U.S. Ambassador Grew had specifically questioned Japan's Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Masayuki Tani, yesterday because the Japanese authorities in Tianjin were strictly blockading foreign concessions, causing great inconvenience to American expatriates. The spokesperson replied that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs must convey this question to the local Japanese authorities, so he was unable to answer the U.S. Ambassador at this time. The spokesperson reiterated that the silver issue and the blockade of the concession were two separate matters. The blockade of the British and French concessions in Tianjin was due to the Japanese military authorities considering it militarily necessary. As for the silver issue, it has nothing to do with military affairs. However, when resolving these two issues, they may be related to each other in one or two aspects.

<p>Stockholm, Sweden - According to sources here, a fierce battle is taking place near Lillehammer, where the Gudbrandsdal valley, the gateway to Oslo in central Norway, enters the southern plains. British and Norwegian troops are attacking towards Hama. Although they have encountered strong German resistance, they have finally reached Morf. (Reuters on the 24th)</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden - Correspondents report that five days of wind and snow have stalled military operations in Narvik. Although German aircraft bombed various towns and communication lines, reinforcements continued to advance towards Lillehammer from the Gudbrandsdal valley. It is reported that fresh Allied troops have arrived in Namsos despite German air raids. (Reuters dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>London - Regarding the Norwegian war, well-informed sources here recently stated that Trondheim Harbor is one of the main targets of the Allied operations. The northern troops of the Allied forces landed at Namsos Harbor and the southern troops landed at Andalsnes Harbor are advancing separately towards Trondheim Harbor. Among them, the northern troops have already reached Stenkjer (north of Trondheim Harbor) and have made contact with German troops. The southern troops have approached Storlien, an important stronghold on the Trondheim Harbor to Oslo railway line. If they can capture the city, the supply sources of the German troops in Trondheim Harbor can be completely cut off. In addition, after the Allied forces advanced towards Hama, they have already placed most of this railway line under control. Once the Allied forces capture Trondheim Harbor and use the navy in the Skagerrak and Kattegat straits to take decisive actions to prevent German transportation, Germany's risky actions in the Scandinavian Peninsula can be brought to an end. As for the issue of supplying munitions and transporting troops in this war, it is extremely important for the German army. Since the German airfields in Denmark and Norway have been repeatedly bombed by Allied aircraft, their aerial transportation has been greatly hindered. In addition, as far as the war in northern Norway is concerned, the British and French Allied forces and the Norwegian army are cooperating in the Narvik area. The Norwegian army there is well-equipped, well-trained, and has extremely strong combat power. (Havas dispatch on the 23rd)</p>

Allied troops have rapidly advanced from the landing points to the area. At the same time, according to sources here, Allied and Norwegian troops have been forced to abandon several outpost positions, but this is only a temporary situation.

In some places north of Trondheim, British and German troops are less than 200 yards apart. Currently, the German army maintains air supremacy because the Allied army's anti-aircraft guns and fighter planes are noticeably lacking. However, although German aircraft have carried out repeated air raids, the British defense lines have not been damaged. Only the British headquarters has moved twice. The ability of German aircraft to quickly discover the location of the British headquarters makes one suspect the existence of a well-established spy system. (Reuters dispatch on the 24th)</p>

<h3 id="e35">British Second Wartime Budget - Totaling 2.6 Billion Pounds - Huge Tax Revenue Numbers Open a New Chapter in Fiscal History - Chancellor of the Exchequer Urges National Thrift to Achieve Victory <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>London - When British Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon presented his second wartime budget, he claimed that the 500 million pounds of funds approved by the House of Commons now had a surplus of 91 million pounds, or that various departments should be blamed for this surplus because they failed to prepare for war as quickly as they should have. In fact, this accusation is completely unfair, because the detailed audit of the expenses of various departments may differ from the general estimates when the budget was passed. The actual expenditure in the past year was 1,816,873,000 pounds, not the 1,933,000,000 pounds of the emergency budget, so a total of 116,500,000 pounds was accumulated under last year's expenditure. In addition to this, there is something even more exciting: the income budget was originally 995,000,000 pounds, but the actual revenue exceeded this amount by 54,000,000 pounds (applause). People enthusiastically paid the increased income tax and surtax. Almost all of the income tax and surtax estimated in September last year were collected in full, with income tax revenue of 390,000,000 pounds. This is the largest income tax revenue in a single year. During the first year of the last World War, a total of 59,000,000 pounds was collected in income tax, while the previous session collected 390,000,000 pounds, which is more than six times higher. The previous surtax collected a total of 69,750,000 pounds, while only 10,000,000 pounds were collected in the first year of the last World War. Death duties also collected more than 2 million pounds more than budgeted. The defense contribution collected approximately 27,000,000 pounds. This budget collected approximately 2 million pounds more. Excess profits tax revenue was 40,000 pounds. Domestic tax revenue was 587,000,000 pounds, an increase of 8,250,000 pounds over the budget. Customs and excise tax revenue was 400,000,000 pounds, an increase of 27,500,000 pounds over the budget. Tobacco tax revenue increased by 9,700,000 pounds over the budget. Sugar tax revenue increased by 4,600,000 pounds. Beer tax revenue increased by 750,000 pounds. And the most surprising unexpected increase was in vehicle tax. When he proposed increasing the private vehicle tax to 25 shillings per horsepower, he estimated that 22 million pounds could be collected, but the actual revenue has reached 34 million pounds. On the one hand, the government does not encourage wasteful travel by car, and on the other hand, it maintains the source of tax revenue. The net income of the post office has not exceeded the estimate of September last year. Statistically, the expenditure in the previous session was 1,817,000,000 pounds, and the income was 1,049,000,000 pounds. The difference between the two was 768,000,000 pounds, which was made up by borrowing. In September last year, he estimated that 938,000,000 pounds would need to be borrowed to cover last year's expenses, but the situation today is much better than expected last year.</p>

<p>The problems ahead are even more serious. The national debt has increased from 8,163,000,000 pounds at the beginning of this year to 8,931,000,000 pounds at the end of March. The government will inevitably request approval of expenses at any time this year, and the number requested is only listed as an integer for the sake of public interest without detailed distinction of the expenses of various departments, so as not to let the enemy know about the United Kingdom's construction of new ships or increase in air force. The first request for funds this year was 700,000,000 pounds and was passed on March 13, but it is extremely difficult to estimate how much funding is needed for the entire 12 months. In the first seven months of this war, the war cost was 905,000,000 pounds. Based on this calculation, approximately 1,500,000,000 pounds will be needed for 12 months. However, such an estimate is not accurate, because war costs are increasing day by day, and it is inevitable and reasonable that they will increase. Therefore, he estimates that by the end of March next year, the war cost alone will be approximately 2,000,000,000 pounds. In addition to this 2,000,000,000 pounds, he also needs to add the national debt redemption fund and civil expenditures. The estimated appropriation for the national debt redemption fund is 247,000,000 pounds, and the usual estimate for civil expenditures, including civil defense, is 420,000,000 pounds. Together, the above figures total 2,667,000,000 pounds, which is the funding required for this term. The issue of economizing on public spending is a matter of constant concern for enlightened people in the country. For the sake of final victory, the people of this country should be prepared to accept the burden of this budget without complaint, because they should feel that the government is doing its best to eliminate waste, and what they pay is only what is necessary.</p>
<h3 id="e37">Statement by the Minister of Finance on Tax Revenue Plan <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>The Minister of Finance has been discussing the issue of how much revenue could be continuously collected from the existing tax rates. It is estimated that the fixed tax revenue could be £85,000,000, stamp duty £19,000,000, national defense contributions and excess profits tax £70,000,000. Inland revenue, based on existing tax rules, could reach £658,000,000, an increase of £75,000,000 compared to last year. Customs duties and excise duties collected £400,000,000 last year. Based on this, it is estimated that £420,000,000 can be collected this year, and automobile tax can reach £35,000,000. The Minister of Finance stated that the government has decided to include postal revenue into the Ministry of Finance. The government will consider struggling industries. Given the wartime situation, the government has to postpone the re-evaluation of property values for income tax collection. The Ministry of Finance proposes amending legislation to address property tax evasion. Regarding customs duties and excise duties, he proposed enacting legislation on two points: first, to improve the export drawback system to support export trade, and second, related to the Imperial Sugar Preference system, to continue the existing preferences until the end of August 1942. The Minister of Finance also stated that, according to last year's method, the income could be £1,133,000,000. However, this total amount requires higher taxes, so he has to pay attention to both direct and indirect taxes. In the future, income tax will increase from seven shillings to seven shillings and six pence, and those with an annual income of more than £1,500 will be subject to surtax. The telephone tax will increase to 15%. A new tax calculated as a percentage will be levied on wholesale sales to retailers, except for food, beverages, fuel for humans and livestock, and heavily taxed items such as tobacco. The beer tax will increase by one penny per pint. The whisky tax will increase by one shilling and nine pence per bottle. The tobacco tax will increase by four shillings per pound. The match tax will be fifty pence per gross. Inland letter postage will increase by one penny. Overseas postage will increase to three pence instead of two and a half pence. The standard alcohol tax will increase by fifteen shillings per gallon, totaling ninety-seven shillings and six pence.</p>
<p>Increase in Income Tax Standard</p>
<p>When announcing the plan to increase the standard income tax from seven shillings to seven shillings and six pence and to reduce income tax deductions, the Minister of Finance stated that the tax increase is very high, and the burden of direct taxes in this country is higher than before. Within a year, the standard rate of income tax has increased from five shillings and six pence to seven shillings and six pence, plus surtax, its highest rate will reach seventeen shillings per pound. Whether in wartime or peacetime, these tax rates are unprecedented. In 1918, the highest income tax rate was only six shillings, or ten shillings and six pence per pound including surtax. A married person with no children, if having an annual income of £300, must pay £15 in income tax, instead of £7 last year and £5 the year before. And those who earn £400 a year must pay £30 twelve shillings and six pence in income tax, instead of £17 ten shillings last year and £12 twelve shillings and six pence the year before. Anyone with an annual income of £600 must pay £92 sixteen shillings and six pence in income tax, instead of £73 ten shillings last year and £56 twelve shillings and six pence the year before. This change, as well as minor changes, can generate £42,000,000 in direct taxes this year, and £61,750,000 for the whole year. There is also a change in the surtax, that is, those whose annual income exceeds £1,500 but not £2,000 in 1940-41 will have to pay surtax.</p>
<p>Indirect Taxes Increased Significantly</p>
<p>As for indirect taxes, the beer tax will increase by one penny per pint from April 24, which can bring in £18,000,000 for the whole year, and £15,000,000 in this financial year. The French government also abandoned its treaty rights, allowing French alcohol imported into the United Kingdom to be subject to increased taxes. Therefore, from today, after increasing the standard alcohol tax by fifteen shillings per gallon, it can bring in £7,000,000 for the whole year, and £6,500,000 in this financial year. The tobacco tax will increase by four shillings per pound from today, or three pence per ounce, and taxes on cigars and other items will also be increased accordingly. Two tax increases on this item within a year are indeed burdensome, but in the current financial situation, it is impossible not to increase taxes. It is estimated that the tobacco tax can increase to £23,000,000 for the whole year, and £21,000,000 in this financial year. The excise tax on matches will be doubled from April 29, and customs duties will also be increased accordingly. A box of matches with fifty sticks, which originally cost one penny, will now cost one and a half pence. In this financial year, this tax can bring in more than £3,500,000, and £4,000,000 for the whole year. Lighters will also be taxed appropriately. As for postage, the increase is for certain initial postage rates, but the fees for exceeding weight will remain unchanged. The domestic postage increase rates are as follows: letters weighing no more than two ounces will increase from one and a half pence to two and a half pence, postcards will increase from one penny to two pence, printed matter will increase by half a penny per item, and newspapers will increase by half a penny. The overseas postage increase rates are as follows: letters will increase from two and a half pence to two pence, and airmail will not be charged. It is estimated that the increase in postage can bring in £10,400,000 in this financial year, and £11,000,000 for the whole year. Domestic telephone fees, whether for business or public use, will increase by 15% from May 1, and private telephone fees will increase by 25%. This item can collect £2,000,000 in this financial year, and £2,500,000 for the whole year. Domestic telegraph fees will increase by three pence for each ordinary or congratulatory telegram from July 1, and news telegrams will also increase by three pence per page. Private telegrams will increase by 25%. This item can collect about £160,000 in this financial year, and £240,000 for the whole year. Overseas telegrams and telephone calls will be restricted during wartime, and there are no plans to increase prices at this time. It is estimated that £12,500,000 can be obtained in this financial year, and £14,500,000 for the whole year.</p>
<p>Purchase Tax Collection Method</p>
<p>The Minister of Finance then mentioned a new tax, saying that various countries and British dominions levy different types of sales taxes, but the methods are different. What he is proposing now is a purchase tax, which is levied as a percentage of the price when wholesalers sell to retailers. Such taxation has a great convenience, that is, it is easy to implement. Goods for export are not subject to purchase tax. While the government promotes the movement to increase exports, it should also limit unnecessary domestic waste. Raw materials required by industries are not subject to purchase tax. Food and beverages for cattle and livestock, as well as heavily taxed items such as tobacco and petroleum, or fuels, gas, electricity, and water, are also exempt from purchase tax. The date and tax rate for the implementation of this tax will be stipulated by the House of Commons. According to statistics, the income from special tax increases this year is a total of £101,000,000, plus the tax revenue of £1,133,000,000 obtained based on last year's tax rates, the two together total £1,234,000,000. If the purchase tax can be passed, he hopes that there will be some gains by the end of this year. However, the central issue of this budget is even more important than taxes, which is how to raise the huge sum of £1,433,000,000. He opposes the suggestion of forcing the people to save a portion of their income. He believes that it is appropriate to extremely encourage the people to respond to the government's current borrowing methods, which will definitely be effective. This huge sum of money must be raised. The government must improve the situation to encourage free contribution to the government and avoid inflation. Any plan that can help to limit consumption and misuse of power is important. The government's policy is to make the prices of necessary foods reasonable, even if this move costs the national treasury a lot. The government is now using 60 million pounds to suppress the prices of certain necessary foods. Many companies have been controlled, and foreign exchange has also been controlled.</p>
<p>Advantages of Excess Profits Tax</p>
<p>The Minister of Finance mentioned the excess profits tax, saying that excess profits would lose their value if distributed freely as dividends, but it would be very beneficial if used to support businesses and reorganize enterprises during difficult times after the end of the war. However, if scattered into the hands of shareholders, it would only tempt shareholders to use it for consumption. Therefore, he proposed to restrict dividends through company law, stipulating that ordinary dividends should not be greater than the dividends of any of the three years before the war, and companies that have not been able to pay dividends in recent years can be allowed to pay dividends at their discretion. In order to make this plan thorough, he proposed to prohibit the issuance of bonus stocks during the war, except for special reasons for the merger of two companies (cheers).</p>
<p>British Minister of Finance Concludes Speech</p>
<p>The Minister of Finance concluded by saying that the total tax revenue he wants to obtain this year is £1,234,000,000, which is indeed the largest figure for annual tax revenue in British financial history. However, since the expenditure caused by modern warfare is so huge, taxes have to be increased accordingly. According to his calculations, this year will inevitably require at least £85,000,000 more in expenses than last year. He now plans to obtain £185,000,000 more in tax revenue. What will the outcome be? Saving and lending savings to the country must be proportionally increased. The realization of this move is an important part of Britain's war aims. If the people always maintain current loans and pay government taxes, then we have nothing to worry about, because our financial front is also as strong as other fronts in the struggle for victory (cheers).</p>
<p>Opposition Party States Opinions</p>
<p>Labor Party leader Attlee commented on Simon's budget speech, expressing approval for the increase in taxes on beer, alcohol, tobacco, and matches, but believing that the postal tax may not generate much income, but instead cause resentment among most people. Simon's advocacy of automatic savings and opposition to forced savings is also welcomed by him. Liberal leader Sinclair said that Simon's statement on the budget difficulties is very clear. No one can accuse his proposed methods of being too harsh. Germany spent £2,300,000,000 on the war this year, and the efforts made by the French people are greater than what Simon asked of the British people. He believes that Simon has demonstrated the greatness of British financial power to the House of Commons, and the House of Commons' acceptance of his proposals can also prove the noble spirit and firm purpose of a united and determined Britain to win (Reuters, 23rd).</p>
<h3 id="e38">British Newspapers' Comments, All Expressing Goodwill <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>London - Today's special dispatch from here states that the general British newspapers have a quite favorable attitude towards the huge British budget. Although the newspapers have slightly different opinions on the purchase tax and indirect taxes, they all fully recognize that tax increases are inevitable. To win the war, any sacrifice is not considered too great. Some newspapers call this budget "bold and realistic," "a fierce war tool," "serious and fair," and "very faithful." The Manchester Guardian even commented that the budget is still not severe enough, saying that it is more moderate than what the situation requires. The Times reported that this budget has a very great achievement, that is, it has no concealment or rhetoric to ease people's hearts about the truth of our financial situation. Judging from its huge figures, it can prove how strong the financial situation is, and how it will not shrink from dealing with all difficulties. The British people have full determination to make the sacrifices needed for the war. The Allied countries can exert their full strength as soon as possible, and victory can be achieved sooner, and the country's expenditure can be reduced. The Daily Telegraph reported that the Minister of Finance Simon knows that making a bold and realistic statement on the issue of dealing with the huge expenses of modern warfare can win the unanimous support of the country, and make full use of various guarantees. The taxes he increased are few and simple, but the "purchase tax" has entered a new stage. It is not yet known how this tax will be implemented, and it must be carefully considered to avoid injustices and overreach. As for the ability of this tax to generate huge tax revenue, there is no doubt. In short, this budget is a strong appeal to the public, and it is an ideal effort to grasp a major problem. The Daily Herald reported that the main burden will be borne by people with small incomes, and indirect taxes often impose the highest tax amounts on those with the fewest resources, because those who collect this tax are all ordinary consumer goods. The News Chronicle reported that this budget will definitely impress the world with the heavy financial burden we bear. Although the new taxes currently levied are quite heavy, they are not surprising. The Minister of Finance has clearly recognized that fighting a total war requires huge expenditures. The Daily Mail, in addition to criticizing the "purchase tax" as being unfavorable to shop owners and traders, expressed approval for the increase in various indirect taxes. The Daily Express said that although indirect taxes will cause prices to rise, they can limit the consumption of some imported goods. The new tax on tobacco can save our US dollars, and the increase in the price of matches can save the supply of wood. However, the purchase tax is a mystery, and the Minister of Finance has not explained it (Reuters, 24th).</p>

<p>Paris - The 8th Joint Meeting of the Supreme Defense Council of Britain and France was held yesterday and today. Important figures from Norway and Poland also participated, thus becoming a true "War Conference of Allied Countries." According to the communiqué issued afterwards, "In order for the governments of the Allied Countries to promptly fulfill their obligations and jointly protect their interests in order to counter all hostile actions, they exchanged views on all important political and military issues that require close attention. After reviewing the general war situation, various new decisions were taken to ensure that the Allied Countries can implement effective cooperation in all circumstances. Polish Prime Minister General Sikorski declared that the country's government, army, and people are determined to continue fighting with all resources. At this moment, they are actively adjusting and developing all manpower and material resources. The participating countries admired their every effective contribution. The prime ministers of Britain, France, and Poland then asked the Norwegian representative, Ambassador to France, Bakke, to convey to his government that Britain, France, and Poland admired the heroic resistance of the Norwegian people under the leadership of King Haakon VII. Ambassador Ke also expressed his gratitude on behalf of his government for the prompt assistance of the Allied Countries." After the meeting, the British representatives returned to London at 2:30 p.m. Government officials here commented on the decisions taken at this session, saying that the determination of the Allied Countries to fulfill all obligations, protect their interests, and resist all "conspiracies" has been seen more quickly here. In addition, one thing is worth noting, that is, this joint meeting was originally composed of representatives from Britain and France. Due to the participation of important figures from Norway and Poland, it has gradually become a common organization among the Allied Countries. In other words, any country that has been invaded and is determined to resist in order to fulfill its international obligations can participate (Havas, 23rd).</p>
<p>Paris - When the 8th Joint Meeting of the Supreme Defense Council of Britain and France was held, the attitude that each country should adopt towards the situation in Southeastern Europe was submitted for discussion. Regarding Romania and Greece, the guarantees provided by the British and French governments last year are still valid. If any of these countries are invaded by foreign countries, Britain and France will immediately come to their aid. In addition, if the "interests" that Britain and France maintain in Southeastern Europe are harmed, they will definitely deal with them. In this way, even if countries in Southeastern Europe have not been provided with guarantees by Britain and France, if they are invaded, Britain and France will also intervene. This general statement is of great significance. As for the rumors that Britain and France intend to notify Italy of this attitude, it is not accurate. Italy has no intention of interfering in Southeastern Europe. Judging from the guarantee provided by the country to Greece on April 10 last year, its meaning is clear, which shows that the saying that Italy has ulterior motives is not reliable. Even the arguments of Italian newspapers cannot be confused with the policies of the country's government. Generally speaking, Germany seems to be using strong pressure on Italy at the moment. Italy has no choice but to adopt German propaganda slogans in the newspapers and publish comments to support Germany. The country will still avoid any actions that would terminate Italy's current status as a non-belligerent country (Havas, 24th).</p>
<p>Swiss Capital - The "Basler Nachrichten" recently carried a telegram from a Berlin correspondent stating that after the Norwegian representative participated in the 8th Joint Meeting of the Supreme Defense Council of Britain and France, the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs intends to formally declare war on Norway, so as to end the nominally peaceful state between Germany and Norway (Havas, 24th).</p>

<p>Warm Springs - President Roosevelt met with Canadian Prime Minister King at 10:20 a.m. today and talked with each other. Afterwards, according to a statement issued by President Secretary Lise, "The President and the Canadian Prime Minister have known each other for more than 30 years. The Canadian Prime Minister must come to the United States once a year to relive old times with the President, but it has absolutely no political significance. Even in this case, no political issues between the United States or the Canadian Federation were discussed." (Havas, 23rd)</p>

<p>New York - Hayman, General Manager of the National Credit Bank Association, advocated in the association's "Commercial Report" that the United States should stop buying foreign silver. It is said that "If we think it is beneficial to subsidize the domestic silver industry, then we should stop buying foreign silver. The silver policy of 1934, we are now achieving the opposite effect, and have not benefited. China's abolition of the silver currency system is obviously influenced by our silver policy. The increase in foreign purchasing power is all assisted by our purchase of silver." He said that Americans should support the news program currently proposed in Congress, which advocates stopping silver purchases. "If we review the past records, we can prove the error of the silver purchase policy. The Treasury Department has two purposes for purchasing silver: (1) to increase the value of silver to $1.29 per ounce; (2) to accumulate silver to one-third of our country's reserves. Since 1934, our country has purchased as much as 900,000,000 ounces of foreign silver (excluding American mined silver), but the price of silver has not reached $1.29 per ounce, and silver has reached one-third of the reserve standard, which is even lower than before we purchased silver, because our gold inflow is even more than the silver we purchased." Continuing to discuss the domestic business situation and the possibility of increasing foreign trade this year, Hayman said, "Some indications show that the recent business situation is gradually declining, but it is hoped that exports in the most recent month can have a considerable improvement. When we increase foreign trade, we should consider several factors, one of which is the ability of foreign countries to repay exports in the long term after the current credit funds are exhausted. This should depend on whether we are willing to accept greater imports. The ability of exports and imports should also depend on the maintenance of maritime transportation lines. In short, for the outlook for 1940, we believe that the favorable ones, and if it cannot exceed this year, it should be equal to the commercial record of 1939." (United Press, 24th)</p>

<h3 id="e49">Zhejiang University Moved from Guizhou to Qian; Classes Resumed in Zunyi; Now Has Five Colleges <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>(Zunyi Correspondence) In the summer of the 1938th year of the Republic of China, National Zhejiang University moved from western Jiangxi, originally designated Anshun in Guizhou Province as the location of the temporary campus. Later, because Jiangxi and Guizhou were far apart, and all the school's books and instruments, nineteen of which were taken out when leaving Hangzhou, amounted to no less than 2,000 boxes, and the number of teachers and students exceeded 1,000, long-distance transportation was both difficult and time-consuming. With the welcome of local people from Guangxi Province, the school temporarily stopped in Yishan in Guangxi Province, in order to save national funds and seek to resume classes as soon as possible. The school moved to Yishan in September of the year before last and lasted for more than a year until January of this year. In February of last year, it suffered an intentional bombing by Japanese aircraft, but it quickly resumed operations to ensure that studies continued without interruption. However, since the Japanese army landed in Beihai last fall, followed by the fall of Nanning, China's brave land and air forces repeatedly inflicted heavy blows on them in various places in southern Guangxi, causing them to be on the verge of annihilation. However, air raid alarms in Yishan were almost constant, and sometimes lasted all day. All the students were constantly evacuating to avoid air raid alarms, which wasted time and neglected studies, resulting in unimaginable losses to teaching. Therefore, it was necessary to revisit the original plan to move to Guizhou Province to seek a stable life and facilitate the transmission of academic studies. When the Japanese army moved north from Nanning last winter, the school continued to maintain classes in Yishan while sending personnel to Guizhou to prepare for a temporary campus. At the same time, a group of students organized a battlefield service corps to work on the front lines of Qianjiang, Baoyang, and Kunlun Pass for many days, working hard and enduring hardship, achieving remarkable results, and receiving praise from various anti-Japanese armies. At the beginning of this year, the school was presided over by the relocation committee, and began to move north, setting up stations along the way to transport staff, students, books, and instruments. It was again supported by the local authorities of Guizhou Province and various transportation sectors, and the relocation matters were brought to a conclusion in the recent period. Currently, only a small number of secondary books and instruments are still being transported, and it is expected to be completed within two or three weeks. The school's new first-year students and preparatory class students in the 29th year, totaling more than 400, resumed classes on February 8 at the temporary campus in Qingyan, south of Guiyang. More than 500 students in the second, third, and fourth grades also resumed classes on April 22 at the temporary campus in Zunyi. Everything has been largely restored. However, because the school has a large number of people and a lot of equipment, the required housing funds are considerable. Furthermore, considering that the school is divided into two locations in Guizhou Province (the school also has a Longquan branch in Zhejiang Province), teaching is often inconvenient, and the current campuses are all temporary in nature. Therefore, it has recently been planning a relatively permanent campus near Zunyi, in order to concentrate teaching and experimentation and benefit advanced research. The school's organization is currently divided into five colleges: Arts, Sciences, Engineering, Agriculture, and Teacher's College. The College of Arts has three departments: Chinese Literature, Foreign Languages and Literature, and History and Geography. The College of Science has four departments: Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. The College of Engineering has four departments: Electrical Engineering, Chemical Engineering, Civil Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering. The College of Agriculture has six departments: Agronomy, Agricultural Chemistry, Horticulture, Plant Pathology and Entomology, Sericulture, and Agricultural Economics. The Teacher's College has five departments: Education, Chinese Literature, English, History and Geography, Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry. The College of Arts also has a Research Institute of Arts, a Department of History and Geography, and a Research Office of History and Geography Education. The College of Science also has a Teaching Department of the Research Institute of Science. The College of Engineering has an affiliated factory. The College of Agriculture has an affiliated farm. The Teacher's College has an affiliated experimental school, divided into middle school and elementary school departments. The library has about 60,000 books, excluding those stored at the Longquan branch, half Chinese and half Western.</p>

<p>(Chengdu Correspondence) After the July 7th Incident, Qilu University moved from Jinan to Chengdu and built temporary school buildings for classes. The original Research Institute of Chinese Studies was suspended after the incident. In the autumn of the 28th year, the Research Institute was rebuilt, and Gu Jiegang was hired to preside over the institute's affairs. The compilation work that is already underway includes "Collection of Materials on the History of Chinese Nationalities." Materials related to the history of Chinese nationalities have been sorted out from official histories, unofficial histories, classics, philosophical works, local chronicles, inscriptions, and foreign selections, and tables, annotations, and indexes have been made for them. The materials are being classified and compiled. Other projects include "Collection of Materials on the History of Chinese Academics," "Collection of Materials on the History of Chinese Religions," and "Series of Historical Materials on the Chinese Borderlands," all of which are in the planning stage. The institute published a quarterly journal in the spring of the 29th year and will publish one or two books on Chinese general history within this year. It also recruits several graduate students each year, providing them with living allowances and guiding them in advanced research in Chinese studies.</p>

<p>The "International Cup" Table Tennis Championship, organized by the International Table Tennis Association, is participated by China, Russia, and Jewish teams. The Chinese team, by virtue of winning the International Cup organized by the Mainland News last year, has secured the priority of the finals. The Jewish team eliminated Russia in the semi-finals last week with a score of 13 to 6 and will meet the Chinese team in the finals.

All proceeds, after expenses, will be used to help Chinese and Jewish refugees. After the competition, Xu Duo, chairman of the Shanghai Table Tennis Association, will present the awards. In terms of men's strength, the Jewish team is far inferior to our Chinese team. The men's championship should be in the bag for the Chinese team. In the women's division, the Jewish team has the famous chopper Mrs. Difey and the short-stop experts Porojin and Newman, who are very strong. In particular, the doubles combination of Mrs. Difey and Porojin is skilled and well-coordinated. The Chinese women's representatives are the elite from both the China United Women's Team and the Young Women's Team. Famous players such as Liang Yujie, Lin Jinlan, Huang Xiangyin, and Zhang Yongru are all the best of their time. The two sides are evenly matched, and a fierce battle is inevitable. The outcome is difficult to predict. May our female players work hard in the competition, without arrogance or discouragement, and win glory for the international table tennis community.

<p>China Youth Failed by One Point; Third Round to Determine the Winner</p>
<p>The 10th Gongzhan Cup Handball Tournament, the second round, in order for the new players to have more practice opportunities, the China Youth team did not have a must-win mentality in the second round. Last night was the main battle between the first and second groups. The handball king Zhu Kuan and the veteran Sun Daosheng, with their heroic strategies and clever plans, purely took advantage of their intelligence. As a result, they won with a score of 2 to 1. In the end, the first doubles team Yan Peiqiu and Hua Fenggang played. After the other side Huam Tiao and F. Quikling cooperated (Huam was originally the second doubles), after a fierce battle in three rounds, Yan Hua preserved their strength and suffered a setback with a score of 1 to 2. In total, the victory in the second round went to the West Youth team, with a score of 8 to 7. The two China and West Youth teams have each won one round. Who will win the championship? The decisive third round has been scheduled to start next Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. The battle will still be ten singles matches and five doubles matches. In this second round, the West Youth team used Keqi Miluo, who had not been registered, to play in the tenth singles match, which violated the rules, which is very regrettable. In principle, the China Youth team could protest, but for the sake of sportsmanship and spirit, they are only given a warning.</p>

<p>The foreign exchange market yesterday, HSBC's listing showed no change, and the informal market for British and American currencies continued to weaken, a change from the previous style. In particular, speculators, who had long held bullish positions, were eager to liquidate, and although the appetite of outsiders was still good, supply and demand were ultimately difficult to resist, and the market became rigid. The situation was still calm in the early morning, but before long, speculators began to sell off a large number of holdings, and even the Hong Kong electricity company, which had been inactive for a long time, suddenly began to sell. The US dollar reached a price of $6.0625, and swap and arbitrage activities were still underway.</p>
<p>Swaps are still active</p>
<p>In the early morning, the London large strip fell by 3.125, and the small strip fell by .25. The New York silver price remained flat, and the London raw gold remained stable. The exchange rates for British against American, Shanghai, and French currencies were all flat. The British against the American narrowed by 1.125, against Shanghai unchanged, and against French currency decreased by .875. The central government's listed exchange rates remained the same. Banks opened spot selling prices in the morning, with British gold at 4 shillings 1.125 and the US dollar at $6.03125, about the same as the closing prices of the night before. At the same time, the futures opening prices also remained unchanged. After the opening, speculators were the first to sell, and the situation became weak again. It is estimated that outsiders absorbed US dollars for May from speculators at $5.75, and outsiders also absorbed US dollars for April from speculators at $6.03125.

<h3 id="e61">Amidst a Chorus of Selling; the Gold Market is Unbearable to Look Back On; Has Fallen for Five Consecutive Days to $162 <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>The cash gold informal market situation yesterday, first fell and then rebounded, the falling trend became increasingly intense, unbearable to look back. It is estimated that it has fallen for five consecutive days, pressing on $200. The reasons for the decline have been detailed earlier, and with the gradual loosening of the foreign exchange market, the desire to buy gold has inevitably declined. The situation was quite good at first, opening at $5,735, and gold firms and bank gangs had quickly reached $5,748. However, the good times were short-lived. After that, it fell sharply. Securities firms, money changers, and retail investors gathered to sell, and gold firms were even willing to sell limited盘 at $5,720. In addition, the foreign exchange market was loose at that time, and there was a strange shortage of buyers, so it fell directly to $5,650. Before closing, a money changer entered a little bit, trying to pull it up by $15. As a result, it was $5,665, a decrease of $57 from the previous day. In the afternoon, Wednesday was a non-trading day, and limited price buyers were heard outside the market at $5 lower than the afternoon closing price. Half-day trading was about 1,700 taels. Jewelry gold fell slightly by $10, and customs gold remained flat.</p>
<p>Cash Gold Fell by $57</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the morning, the exchange rate for each strip (10 taels) was reported to be falling, and people's hearts were slightly better, so the market opened up by $13. First, money changers made 30 taels between each other, at $5,735. Then, gold firms and bank gangs searched in, and retail investors also came to enter, so it gradually increased by $13. Securities firms entered 50 taels of money exchange industry, at $5,748. After that, the bank gang suddenly started selling, and another securities firm also had 塞出, and the market situation suddenly turned around, retreating to within the $5,730. However, at that time, a gold firm saw the cheap limited price buy-in, which was small, and once relied on it to stand firm. However, not long after, the gold firm stopped buying, immediately retreating to $5,720. Unexpectedly, at that time, the gold firm suddenly settled for the retail investors, and there were no buyers, and it dropped again to the $5,700 mark. After breaking into the $5,700 mark, the bank gang and other floating long positions also settled one after another, and then fell to $50, and the bank sold to the money exchange industry 10 taels, at a price of $5,650 low. Near the close, a money exchange industry raised the price to buy, and then rebounded by $15. The money exchange entered 20 taels of gold firms, at $5,665 as the afternoon closing price. As a result, it fell again by $57 from the previous day, with fluctuations of $98 in half a day. It has been falling for five consecutive days, totaling $162.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold挂小$10</p>
<p>Jewelry gold was exchanged for each tael. At first, Datong Bank still hung $580, but at 10:30, it掛小$5, and at 11:30, it was lowered by another $5. After that, there was no change. As a result, it was a total of small ten yuan, and Datong Bank changed to hang $570, and the new industry was the same as the above price, and the revenue was reduced by about $15.</p>

<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market situation, only British and American gold pounds continued to trend down with the gold price, and the supply from all parties continued unabated, and the market price fell unanimously by $1. The supply and demand of British spare tickets was still balanced, and the market price stabilized. The US dollar ticket rose and fell sharply, starting with the pound price falling by another 1.25 points, and once rising to $16.46. But it was finally trapped by the tight money supply, and holders tilted up and down to take advantage of the high price. At noon, it retreated to $16.32 again. It only turned slightly higher in the afternoon, and the off-exchange market was $16.35, up one point from the previous day. The supply of Annan tickets was relatively high, and the market price was slightly soft. The falling wind of Japanese gold tickets has stopped, and the off-exchange market is $1.275, which has recovered by five厘 from the previous day. North Korean tickets have entered a stable state, and the off-exchange market is still traded at par with 法币.</p>
<h3 id="e63">Discount Changes Are Small <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's exchange rates and bill discount rates had little change. Each thousand dollars had been as high as $112.5 in the morning, and then returned to flat, to $110 at noon. The afternoon was quite flat, still $110, the same as the previous day. The Qianye Public exchange拆息 remained unchanged, and the morning and afternoon markets were both掛角云.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Securities Exchange: Domestic and Foreign Securities Exchange; Foreign Stock Market Conditions Gradually Reach Their Peak <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the over-the-counter market for Unified Public Bonds, after several days of decline, showed a slight tendency to stabilize. However, due to the excessive accumulation of funds, foreign exchange arbitrage exceeding five percent, and the dramatic rise and fall of foreign stocks, speculators abandoned bonds in favor of foreign stocks, leading to a continuous outflow of physical bonds and widespread anxiety. Buyers were hesitant, and large-scale bullish investors, burdened by high overnight interest rates and difficulties in turnover since last week, saw their potential greatly diminished. Consequently, they became cautious in their purchases, causing the market atmosphere to suddenly become quiet, with prices fluctuating. However, during the session, there was a slight strengthening, showing signs of recovery. When the market opened in the morning, Sheng, Tongji, Hengkang, Yitai, and others initially pushed prices down, causing them to weaken considerably. Subsequently, Dakang, Chengjiu, Fenglian, and Tongshun successively raised prices, returning them to two or three jiao higher. Afternoon trading was scarce, with little to report. Only sporadic buying and selling created a slightly uneven market. As a result, except for Type B bonds, which remained down by a small five fen, all others rose by five fen to two jiao and a half. Trading volume decreased sharply to just over 600,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The stock market at the Public Exchange yesterday was generally calm, with prices fluctuating little. Most of the increased quantity was absorbed. Jardine Matheson shares showed a very erratic trend, with prices fluctuating between 215 and 235 yuan. Union Insurance shares were very active, with prices rebounding due to the resolution of the dockworkers' strike. China Land Investment shares continued to rise, with a trading volume of over 41,000 shares. The closing price was 29.5 yuan with buyers. Rubber shares fell slightly, and the market was dull. Due to the large trading volume in the previous few days, the authorities have decided to suspend trading on Friday (the 26th) afternoon to accommodate the busy settlement work. The market will be closed as usual on Saturday.</p>
<p>London, 23rd (Tuesday) Dispatch: Today, the listed prices of Chinese foreign bonds have slightly fallen in the high range and remained stable in the low range. The Crisp Loan fell by 1.5 pounds to 71.5 pounds, and the Reorganization Loan bonds fell by 1 pound to 36 pounds. The rest remained unchanged.</p>
<p>London, 23rd (Tuesday) Dispatch: Today, the listed prices of British Far Eastern companies' stocks showed mixed gains and losses. HSBC shares fell by half a pound to 93 pounds.</p>
<p>This newspaper received a letter from Mr. Li Tongyi discussing the future of stocks and the necessary considerations, stating, "The true value of stocks should be judged based on the sustainability or temporary prosperity of the business, the state of assets and liabilities, and the distribution of profits. However, since the success of the China Land Investment Company, some stocks in the Public Exchange have reached rare high prices. The market only hears of someone earning thousands, someone profiting tens of thousands, or even hundreds of thousands or millions of yuan, with no one losing money. So, who is paying for these profits? It is the buyers holding high-priced stocks, hoping for continued gains. Taking a certain company's stock as an example, the face value is 3.5 yuan, and the market price is above 22 yuan. Last year's dividend was 1.2 yuan, and coal production was around 200,000 tons. Every year in July, there is often an irresistible flood, and this year's coal production is said to be three months later than last year. Yet, the market price exceeds the face value by more than seven times. Jardine Matheson and Wheelock &amp; Co. have made huge profits due to the war, one paying a dividend of 5 yuan and the other expected to pay about 10 yuan or more. Now, they are artificially raised to about 8% weekly interest, and the buyers do not consider it expensive. What kind of mentality do these people have? The Union Insurance Company's report states that this year's business is not better than last year's, and the cost of metal materials is high. Cheap inventory will soon be used up, and it is uncertain whether future profits will be substantial. Moreover, the last dividend paid was only 2.5 yuan per share, while the market price is as high as 48 yuan. In addition, public utility stocks have also exceeded the reasonable range. Therefore, it is more worthwhile for Westerners to deposit cash in foreign banks without interest and use it to buy foreign stocks. If you really want to operate in the stock market, you should also choose stable foreign stocks for buying. Otherwise, it is like gambling. I ask, can anyone consistently win in gambling?"</p>
<h3 id="e65">Food: Smooth and Unimpeded Sources; Rice Market Speculation Loses Its Basis; Dumi is Declining; Foreign Rice is Falling Even More Sharply <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>The rice market continued its downward trend, with foreign rice having even less of a foothold, plummeting by two yuan. This is because the source of domestic rice has been smooth and unimpeded, with fresh arrivals daily, and Shanghai's inventory has become abundant. Yesterday, another two to three thousand bags of goods from Xichang, Qing Si, and the southern port arrived, with very low selling prices. It is said that the over-the-counter market outside the market continued to depreciate by about one yuan. Although high-grade white rice is no longer as desirable as No. 1 Saigon rice, it is about two yuan cheaper. Changxi Qing rice is only 44 yuan or 43.5 yuan, Su Kun rice is 43 yuan, and Zhong Su is only about 42 yuan. Except for the genuinely special Qingjiao Sijing thin rice, which still needs 45 yuan due to shortage, the medium special is 44 yuan, the general market is 43.6 yuan to 43 yuan, and the high Nan Gang early and late rice is 42.5 yuan, followed by 41.5 yuan and 41 yuan. The price of the bags of rice seen in the market has fallen into the limit plate, selling for 39.5 yuan to 39 yuan, causing general guests to favor domestic rice, and foreign rice is rarely asked about. Moreover, with the price of gold falling and the local prices approaching, those holding goods are particularly panicked. Brokers have changed from guarding to selling, and speculators have lost their basis, and all have left the market. For a time, shouts were frequent, and low prices were repeated, but the sales field was sluggish, and no rice was traded, forming a situation of only outflow and no inflow, and the downstream momentum was like a dyke being breached.</p>
<p>Foreign rice spot goods have seen a sharp decline. The price of 4 or 5-month Two Dog Saigon rice, which was previously 54.1 yuan, was only 53 yuan yesterday morning, and fell to 52 yuan in the afternoon, with a lack of large buyers accepting it. The spot small bag originally sold for 50.3 yuan in the morning, but only 49 yuan in the afternoon. The spot No. 2 sold for 49.3 yuan, a sharp drop of about two yuan compared to the previous day. The price of high-quality foreign rice is only a few angles higher, while the medium and low grades are being sold off at 1 yuan to 1.5 yuan each. In the afternoon, due to the sharp fall in returned goods, the digestion of spot goods was particularly sluggish. Some medium and low-grade goods were sold off at a discount of 4 or 5 jiao, and people's hearts were weak, and the situation was difficult to recover. Moreover, the daily money market was extremely concentrated, and spot interest rates were high. It is reported that the 2,400 tons of West Rice, which was previously blocked in Hong Kong, have already been shipped out. Although most of it is transshipped to the north, the people in the market are all weak in their hearts.</p>
<p>Although glutinous rice is priced low, it is still often asked about, but it is inevitably restricted and followed down by about one yuan.</p>
<p>In short, the decline in rice prices this time was expected. Since domestic rice can flow smoothly and without obstruction, and the warehouse stock is so abundant, it is inevitable. In the past, the price of gold rose sharply, and the exchange rate shrank, making the price of foreign rice inaccessible. The two mutually constrained each other, causing the price to rise instead. Now, the time has passed and the scenery has changed, and the price of rice is trending downward, returning to a state of flatness. We will wait and see.</p>
<h3 id="e66">Flour and Wheat are Flat and Weak <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>The market price of No. 2 flour from the flour mill yesterday was still 13.8 yuan. The market environment was not as lively as the previous two days, and the sales to customers were light. The money market was tight, and the rice price fell slightly, which also discouraged the street's appetite. Stockholders rarely patronized, so the returned goods were gradually weakening. The unit price of old-brand flour was 13.74 yuan, and Double Lion brand was 13.434 yuan. The market was generally flat and weak. The total turnover of flour in the city was only six to seven thousand bags.</p>
<p>The current sales of wheat flour are flat. The Chinese mills attach great importance to the eating plate, but the sellers are unwilling to accommodate too much because the arrival and stock of domestic wheat are both scarce. It is said that the Fu and Fu mills sent 500 to 600 bags of goods to the mill, with the highest price being 31 yuan, including 20.078 yuan for Guan goods. The market is mediocre, but there is a rumor that it will drop by a small number of jiao, but the transaction has not yet been finalized.</p>

<p>The yarn market continued to rise, and the trend remained tight. However, some of those who had profited from the three consecutive days of gains released their positions, causing the surface to loosen and return to flatness. This situation is a normal phenomenon. However, those with ample general economic resources have firmly absorbed the volume and will not give up, because the spot goods are being emptied.</p>
<p>The spot yarn market opened in the morning with the momentum of the previous day's enthusiasm and continued to rise. The price of 20-count Shuangma factory yarn was 1,470 yuan, but the spot business was not strong, and the market showed signs of weakness. In a short time, it fell by 10 yuan, and the factory price was 1,450 yuan. However, the purchase by low-price households rose again, and the recovery was also rapid. The factory price rose to 1,479 yuan in a single hour. By the close, it was slightly weaker. The total transaction volume in half a day was 1,665 bags, and the spot price of 20-count Shuangma rose by 10 yuan. Today, 270 pieces arrived in Hong Kong. The amount purchased by each gang is listed on the left:</p>
<p>Same trade 1,525 Hong Kong 80</p>

<p>The bank's transactions are very scarce, but the transactions of Indian and American cotton are more lively. However, they are all intra-industry buying and selling, and the factory's acceptance is very slow. The current cotton transaction situation is listed on the left:</p>
<p>Middling 283.00 Same trade entered 200 pieces</p>
<p>Also 292.50 Also 400 pieces</p>

<p>South Pacific 213.50 Also 310 bags</p>
<p>Pengjiapu 246.50 Also 100 pieces</p>
<p>In addition, foreign cotton market prices, the New York cotton market, was very firm and lively in the early morning. Later, it rose due to enthusiastic buyers and a partial short covering. The high price of Wall Street had a great impact on the cotton market. As a result, the closing market was firm, and both near and distant futures rose three or four points compared to the previous day. India rose one rupee yesterday, including forecasts.</p>
<p>The foreign cotton transaction in Shanghai Port was slightly quiet due to the extraordinarily tight money market in the city. However, the selling price has always been high. Except for some colleagues who must ship goods in this month due to silver market relations, they can only sell at a discount. It is said that the transaction price of Mi Lin at one time yesterday was 295 yuan, which was very cheap. It is generally expected that the price of cotton will rise sharply in mid-May. The cotton market yesterday, converted into a factory price at a US exchange rate of six yuan, is as follows:</p>
<p>20 Count US Middling 296.50</p>
<p>20 Count Also Lower Grade 287.00</p>

<p>Hongji No. 2, the raw material for coal briquettes, was affected by the European War in the previous ten days, and shipping was blocked. The black market had shouted a price of 125 yuan, but there was no large-scale supply, so small coal briquette factories had to change to second-class goods for manufacturing. Yesterday, the Manley wheel carried 3,650 tons of Hongji fines, which have arrived at the port and are being unloaded. The second wheel is also about to arrive within days, so people's hearts are gradually stabilized, and the market may fall back.</p>

<p>The market conditions for soybeans yesterday were because the gangs were not greedy, and the general speculators were therefore at a loss, and the oil market was also showing a loose trend, so people's hearts turned frustrated, but the high beans were still fixed, and the middle and second beans were quite competitive, so the market has fallen by five or six jiao. A total of only 300 bags of Dingjia Prefecture beans, 250 bags of Anqing beans, 2 cars of Bengbu beans, 150 bags of Xiashi beans, and 150 bags of Chongming Sand Yellow were traded. The prices are all detailed in the market price column.</p>

Summer goods such as white bunting, white straight tribute, feather yarn, fat pick, barathia, manila, twill, saxony, yellow twill, Sanjiang cloth, white canvas, linen glue cloth, white gauze slant, Buddha Yilai, etc., are all lacking, and the market atmosphere is exceptionally brisk.

<p>The US bar iron market was very lively before, but it was once deserted in the middle. However, in the past one or two days, it has improved again.

<h3 id="e80">US Tightens Defenses on Guam to Maintain the Status Quo in the Pacific; Admiral Hart Issues Earnest Remarks; Necessary Measures Will Be Taken if the Philippines Are Invaded <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Admiral Hart, Commander of the US Asiatic Fleet, received Western reporters yesterday on the US flagship Augusta. Admiral Hart expressed his full agreement with the idea of establishing defenses on Guam as a naval base. Some people may have doubts about this. Regarding this point, Admiral Hart believes that in order to maintain the original state of Guam, it is necessary to expedite the implementation of defenses, as this is in line with the US policy of maintaining the existing state of the Pacific.</p>
<p>The Situation in the Dutch East Indies Is Unpredictable</p>
<p>The reporter also asked what measures the US Asiatic Fleet would take if the East Indies issue could not be resolved and the Dutch East Indies were about to be invaded, and whether a plan had been drawn up to deal with future emergencies. Admiral Hart smiled and did not answer, but after being pressed three times, he said, "It is difficult to predict at the moment. I am not willing to make predictions."</p>
<p>Many US Warships Concentrated in Shanghai</p>
<p>Regarding the general policy of the US Navy, Hart was also unwilling to disclose it, but he indicated that the US Navy would definitely take appropriate measures in the near future. He will write a special article to discuss this matter. He also said that since the flagship Augusta sailed to Shanghai, many US warships have been concentrated in Shanghai. In the near future, several more will sail to Shanghai from the Philippines, and some will sail to North China. He added that the current war in the Scandinavian Peninsula would definitely not affect the US Asiatic Fleet, but if the war invaded Philippine territorial waters, the US Navy would naturally take necessary measures.</p>
<p>Restrictions on the Pearl River Have Not Been Lifted</p>
<p>When discussing the opening of the Pearl River, the Admiral said that although it is said that the Pearl River is open, the various restrictions imposed by the Japanese army have not been lifted, and restrictions are still imposed on the passage of foreign warships. Regarding this point, he stated that he was unwilling to express any opinions before conducting an inspection, but he pointed out that the trade between the United States and South China, such as Guangzhou, is still optimistic in the current situation.</p>
<p>Filipinos' Views on Independence</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of Philippine independence, the Admiral stated that the opinions of Filipinos on this issue can be divided into two types. Although the general Filipino deeply loves President Quezon, they also deeply fear that once the Philippines declares independence and is separated from the protection of the United States, it will encounter unexpected crises. Others believe that independence is not risky and express doubts about the aforementioned unfounded worries. As for the farmers in the Philippines, he believes that they have received sufficient self-government training from an early age. He also said that the only coastal defense line of the Philippines is Manila Bay. From a military perspective, he believes that fixed defenses are not sufficient to guarantee defense, as the area is too large and cannot be accomplished without the power of the Navy.</p>
<p>Inspections of Officers and Soldiers Today and Tomorrow</p>
<p>The English-language Da Mei Evening News reported that Admiral Hart, Commander of the US Asiatic Fleet, has scheduled the 25th and 26th to inspect the work and barracks of the US Fourth Marine Regiment stationed in Shanghai, as is customary. The procedure will be to inspect the entire regiment at the Racecourse at 9:00 AM on the 25th, and then inspect the various barracks and officers' offices. On the morning of the 26th, he will inspect the regiment's exercises. During Admiral Hart's inspection, officers from the headquarters will accompany him to investigate various activities of the Marine Corps.</p>
<p>Commissioner to the Philippines to Host a Banquet Tomorrow Evening</p>
<p>US Commissioner to the Philippines, Mr. Sayre and his wife, arrived in Shanghai on the 22nd aboard the US Asiatic Fleet flagship Augusta. They met with Admiral Hart, who had arrived earlier in Shanghai, on the same day. It is now confirmed that Mr. Sayre has scheduled to host a banquet for Admiral Hart and other important US officials in Shanghai, such as Rear Admiral Glassford, Commander of the Yangtze River Fleet, and Attorney General Heermick, Acting US Consul General Batterick, at the Cathay Hotel at 8 PM tomorrow. It is reported that Mr. Sayre will depart for Japan on the 28th to visit Ambassador Grew. It is said that the purpose of his trip is to strengthen the ties between the US government and its foreign envoys, so it is widely believed that Mr. Sayre's reception with the Commander of the US Asiatic Fleet and other important officials in Shanghai is also of great significance.</p>
<h3 id="e81">Native Banks' Internal Market Conference Today to Rush Through Fourth Quarter Settlements <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>With the fourth quarter settlement period approaching, the Native Banks Association has scheduled an internal market conference for 2:00 PM today to handle and decide on various deposits and loans for the fourth quarter period. Factories and firms in the domestic goods business, as well as old customers with good credit, will have their long-term credit loans that are due rolled over, with interest rates set separately, ranging from 8% to 1.5%. It is said that the amount is approximately 10 to 20 million yuan. As for long-term credit loans, the number of transactions is not large, with more transactions related to tea and silk. This is because tea and silk will soon be on the market, and these two industries need funds to go to various production areas to purchase goods. Other loans are few, because native banks, in order to prevent fueling speculation, are following the orders of the Ministry of Finance and are particularly cautious about all loans, especially long-term credit loans. Unless there is sufficient reason to prove that it is a legitimate need, they will not easily release funds. Therefore, the financial market in Shanghai is becoming tighter, but it remains stable, and there is no problem in safely passing the fourth quarter period.</p>
<h3 id="e82">Strict British Inspection of Ships; Delays in Mail and Goods; Transfer via Russia Is Faster; Overseas Chinese Suffer Great Hardships After the Outbreak of the European War; Shandong Merchants Return to Their Home Country via France and Italy <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Most of our overseas Chinese compatriots are engaged in the shipping industry. It is said that in order to blockade Germany's foreign trade, the United Kingdom is conducting extremely strict inspections of "wartime contraband" on ships traveling to and from the North Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. Foreign ships traveling from Asia, Africa, and the Americas to Europe must first anchor at the Downs, south of the Thames Estuary in England, and wait for inspection when passing through the English Channel. The entire crew is trapped and delayed, often for several weeks.</p>
<p>The Downs Is Extremely Convenient for Ships to Stop</p>
<p>The Downs is located west of 2 degrees east longitude, north of 51 degrees north latitude, northeast of Dover, the English port city, protected by Goodwin Sands to the east and blocked by the English coast to the west, making it extremely convenient for ships to stop. Foreign ships entering the Downs are guided by lights and buoys, and other signs indicate the mooring location. In addition, the sea area directly east to the French territorial waters is heavily mined. There is no other way to navigate the sea between the Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea.</p>
<p>Audits and Inspections Take a Long Time</p>
<p>To prevent excessive delays, foreign ships can first send all the documents for their goods to London and ask the competent authority to review them in detail. However, if any suspicious points are found regarding the unloading location or the direction of transport, once the case is transferred to the British Economic Warfare Department for review by the competent authority, it will cause even longer delays. Therefore, the exchange of sea mail between Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Americas, and the delivery of postal parcels by waterway during this period of the European War, must be delayed by at least one month. The mail traffic between Hong Kong and Europe is not as convenient as sending it from Shanghai westward via Russia.</p>
<p>Chinese Merchants Return to Their Home Country with Their Families</p>
<p>The Shandong merchants who have been transporting domestic products to Europe have been leaving Europe with their families and discontinuing their businesses. Chinese expatriates departing from Europe mostly travel by train to France or Italy to avoid the obstacles of the British customs at the Downs, and then buy a boat and sail the ocean from the Mediterranean coast. This is a special state of maritime transport since September 1939, and it is something that our domestic merchants and travelers should thoroughly understand.</p>
<p>Decrease in Ships and Stagnation of Mail</p>

On June 3, a batch will be loaded onto the Hakone Maru to be transported to Europe. As for the latest incoming European mail, there is a batch of mail sealed in Europe on April 12, transported to Shanghai on the Conte Rosso.</p>

<p>Mr. Ma Shaoquan, a prominent figure in Shanghai's business community, was ambushed on the 28th of last month while traveling from his residence to his company. He sustained six gunshot wounds, and one of his bodyguards was also severely injured. He was rushed to Guangci Hospital for treatment and fortunately survived. However, Mr. Ma's friends in Hong Kong and Ningbo, including Chen Qinshi, Luo Qinghua, Shou Yicheng, Du Yuesheng, Wang Xiaoji, and Zhu Meixian, sent telegrams from Hong Kong to Shanghai to express their concern. They suggested that although Mr. Ma's condition was gradually improving, staying in Shanghai for recuperation might still be risky. They all urged him to recuperate elsewhere. Mr. Du and Mr. Wang also took advantage of Mr. Jin Jianxiang's trip from Hong Kong to Shanghai and specifically instructed him to visit Mr. Ma at his residence to comfort and strongly urge him to travel to Hong Kong together. Mr. Ma, unable to refuse their friendship and considering the dangerous environment in Shanghai, left for Hong Kong with Mr. Jin on the 17th of this month to recuperate in a safer location.</p>

<p>The month of May, with its numerous commemorative days, is approaching. Authorities in the Shanghai International Settlement and the French Concession have begun to make necessary preparations to maintain safety and order in both concessions. Sources reveal that security measures will be heightened during the four days of May 1st, May 3rd, May 5th, and May 30th. The police department has prepared the necessary police force. At that time, troops stationed from various countries and the Shanghai Volunteer Corps will be mobilized. Barbed wire will be set up at the border between the two concessions, and pedestrians will be checked to prevent any potential incidents. Yesterday, authoritative sources stated that although the authorities do not want to create an atmosphere of unnecessary tension, the safety and order of the two concessions must be maintained. May 5th marks the anniversary of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's inauguration as the Extraordinary President. According to a previous agreement, Chinese residents can freely display the national flag to commemorate the occasion.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Far East Norwegian Merchant Ships Officially Announce Resumption of Voyages: Norwegian Ambassador to the UK Negotiates with British Authorities, Shipping Routes Also Designated by the British Admiralty <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>After the outbreak of the European war, trade for both Denmark and Norway was severely affected. Ships travelling to the Far East have been ordered to concentrate in Hong Kong and await further instructions, the suspension lasting almost ten days. Concerning the fate of Norwegian ships, the Taipan of the Norwegian company, Hualun Shipping, has been in discussion with the Norwegian Consulate-General in Shanghai every day of last week. By the end of last week, there was a glimmer of hope, but since further instructions were needed from Hong Kong, no announcements were made. However, news of the resumption of voyages was reported yesterday.</p>
<p>All Detained Ships Have Been Released</p>
<p>According to shipping industry sources, the resumption of voyages for Norwegian ships in the Far East was negotiated between the Norwegian Ambassador in London and the British authorities and was officially announced on the 22nd. Besides following British and French wartime shipping rules, the shipping routes were reportedly designated by the British Admiralty. The "Mimei" of Hualun Shipping, previously carrying American flour and heading to Tianjin, was detained by the British Navy in Hong Kong while loading coal due to the Norwegian incident. Yesterday morning, the company received a telegram from the ship stating that it had been released and was sailing directly from Hong Kong to Tianjin that morning.</p>
<p>Resumption of Danish Ship Voyages May be Impossible</p>
<p>The Norwegian ship "Jalisman," managed by Tianxiang Shipping, carrying cargo from the US to Shanghai, was forced to return to Hong Kong after encountering a British warship in the high seas on the morning of last Friday (the 19th). The two Norwegian ships "Titania" and "Jiranna," scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 25th, were also detained when passing through Hong Kong. Yesterday afternoon, Tianxiang Shipping in Shanghai also received a telegram from Hong Kong stating that the three Norwegian ships had departed for Shanghai and were expected to arrive in port this Friday (the 26th). There has been no activity from the Danish ships in Hong Kong, and their resumption of voyages may be impossible.</p>

<h3 id="e88">Residents of Extra-Settlement Roads are Willing to Pay Taxes to the Shanghai Municipal Council; the Tax Bureau Has Also Issued Notices for Collection; Attempts by the Puppet Regime to Extort Residents Door-to-Door are Ineffective <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>The issue of police authority on the extra-settlement roads in West Shanghai was compromised on February 16th of this year when Mr. Fessenden, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, and the puppet "Mayor" Fu Xiaoan reached an interim agreement. The detailed rules are currently being discussed by Mr. Bowen, Commissioner of Police of the Shanghai Municipal Council, and the puppet "Police Chief" Lu Ying, as well as Japanese advisors. According to sources close to the Shanghai Municipal Council, the agreement between the two parties regarding the extra-settlement roads in West Shanghai only pertains to police authority matters and does not involve financial matters such as taxes. The Shanghai Municipal Council has made substantial investments in the area and has no intention of relinquishing control. Therefore, the Shanghai Municipal Council will continue to collect the summer property tax and other taxes in the area, and the Tax Bureau has issued notices for collection. Foreign residents of the extra-settlement roads are also willing to pay taxes to the Shanghai Municipal Council. However, the puppet regime is coveting the taxes in the area and has dispatched personnel from the puppet Finance Bureau to extort residents door-to-door, which is quite strange.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Anti-Mopping-Up Campaign to be Launched in Songhu War Zone: Three Chinese Divisions Reach Destination <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>The Qinghu Road area of the Songhu war zone was previously a guerrilla stronghold. Recently, the county magistrate Lu led the bandit troops of Xu Leisheng to defect to the puppet regime. They were reorganized into the 16th Army of the Peace Preservation Army under the command of Gu Fusheng, who was heavily attacked and severely damaged. He requested assistance from the Japanese military. The Japanese military did not hesitate to mobilize Japanese and puppet troops stationed in Zhabei and the counties of Qingsong and Shangjia, using Xu's troops, who were familiar with the terrain, as guides, forming a large encirclement. They used heavy weapons such as flat-trajectory guns and tanks, covered by swarms of Japanese aircraft, to launch a fierce siege. Gu's troops calmly resisted for three days and nights. The Japanese and puppet troops trembled with fear and indiscriminately looted and killed, regardless of soldiers or civilians. The villages were burned to ashes. Fortunately, Gu's troops bravely attacked and held out for nearly a week. After receiving approval for reinforcements, they temporarily withdrew from the encirclement to a safe area to regroup due to the disparity in numbers. In total, the Japanese army with more than 4,000 troops failed to win and suffered more than 300 casualties. The Chinese army initially had more than 300 troops and fought while increasing their numbers, suffering only more than 30 casualties. Now the troop strength has increased to more than 700 people, seizing more than 200 light and heavy weapons, and also a lot of other military supplies. This is truly a feat in the history of the Songhu guerrilla warfare. The Chinese authorities, upon receiving the report, immediately ordered Gu Zhutong, commander of the war zone, to dispatch the 60x60x two divisions stationed on the Hangjia Road for close-range support. They also transferred the 100 Ganx division, a crack central force, to assist day and night. It is now reported that the vanguard infantry has arrived at the destination and has established close contact with the newly formed 3x division of the New Fourth Army stationed in the border area. According to a military authority, the number of troops joining the battle in the Songhu area is now at least 5,000, and these troops all have sophisticated weapons and are well-equipped. Other reinforcements are also arriving in an endless stream. Soon, a large-scale anti-mopping-up campaign will be launched in the Songhu guerrilla area.</p>

<p>The fourth round of low-priced briquette sales by the Shanghai Machine-Made Briquette Industry Association will commence on the 26th of this month and last until May 5th. The regulations stipulate that each person can still purchase 5.5 jin of briquettes for 0.30 yuan (Chinese currency) per day. The sales time is still from 2:00 PM every day until sold out. A total of 32 locations have been set up in the two concessions, including 18 locations in the International Settlement and 14 locations in the French Concession. The above-mentioned low-priced briquettes are all supplied by the Gongyong, Nanyang, Yitaixing, Guohua, Huacheng Cuiji, Yuanfeng, Yuanhua, Guanghua, Yuedong, Jinghua, and Dongfang, eleven briquette factories. They have also sent letters to the police authorities of the two concessions requesting them to send police to protect the sales.</p>

<p>Since being forced to reorganize, the Dredging Bureau has gradually been preparing to carry out dredging work. The Bureau's giant, world-class "Jianshe" dredger has been idle since the outbreak of the August 13th Shanghai Incident, moored off the Bund in the French Concession for more than 33 months. Yesterday, coal ships were mooring around the vessel to discharge coal, and smoke was coming from the funnels. After the coal is unloaded, it will set sail for Shentan outside Wusongkou to continue dredging. At present, all the dredging machinery and tools on board have been installed, and the crew and workers boarded the ship a month ago to prepare to start work. In addition, the sister ship "Fuxing" is still moored in Danzig. This vessel was originally ordered by the Dredging Bureau from Germany. When construction was completed, the Shanghai Incident occurred, so it was temporarily moored in the Danzig shipyard, and its voyage to Shanghai was suspended. Now, due to the outbreak of war in Europe and unrest at sea, it has not yet been able to sail. It will not be able to leave Danzig until after the end of the European war.</p>

<p>It is reported that Peter, the son of Mr. Lianxi, a well-known British expatriate in Shanghai, died in action on the 21st of this month while flying a plane at the front line. This has been confirmed by a telegram from the British Air Ministry to his parents. Peter was only 19 years old and joined the Royal Air Force in September last year to participate in combat. He was an outstanding combatant and was awarded a medal. His time in France was very brief. His parents have lived in Shanghai for more than 20 years.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Contributing Cures to Relieve Victims of Zhongshan Disaster: Li Ze Delivers Speech <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai All-Circles Relief Association for the Victims of the Zhongshan Disaster held a three-day charity fundraising broadcast at the New Capital Hotel's glass radio station, which was very successful. Due to the severity of the disaster, in order to encourage fellow citizens to actively participate in the fundraising campaign, Mr. Li Ze, vice chairman of the association, delivered a speech yesterday, offering cures, stating: "The Relief Association for the Victims of Zhongshan Disaster was organized after the first fall of Zhongshan County last year. Unexpectedly, Zhongshan County suffered a second fall while we were starting to raise funds. This battle came suddenly, and the loss of food at this time of spring plowing is indescribable. Therefore, the colleagues decided to invite the Yongan Leshe troupe to perform for free. We also received support from ten celebrities in Shanghai, inviting musicians, ladies, celebrities, broadcasting experts, and famous opera singers to perform for free. The total amount of donations was around 50,000 yuan (Chinese currency). The population of Zhongshan County totals over 1 million. According to my personal estimate, at least 50,000 poor people urgently need assistance. The various donations, performances, and broadcasts collected by the association this time amount to no more than 10,000 yuan, which is far from the amount needed to help the victims. Therefore, I believe that we must start with a widespread fundraising campaign and promote a long-term plan to support the victims. In terms of widespread fundraising, there are at least 50,000 to 60,000 people from Zhongshan in Shanghai. If each person can raise 10 yuan for themselves or find a way to raise funds on behalf of others, we will have 500,000 to 600,000 yuan. Furthermore, if all the people in Shanghai participate in promoting fundraising, the amount will naturally be even greater. I hope that everyone will rise up and work together to support this cause."</p>
<h3 id="e94">Ruilun Ship Arrives from Ningbo, Stern Damaged, Enters Dock <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>The British Ruilun ship, managed by Hualun Shipping, arrived at Wusongkou at 1 AM yesterday morning (last night). At that time, it was high tide and the wind was very strong. Moving like an arrow, it sailed straight into Wusongkou. At the location of the first lighthouse at the entrance, there is a stone barrier used by the former Dredging Bureau to block the rapid currents of the Yangtze River from entering. When the Ruilun ship entered the harbor last night, the helmsman saw that the bow of the ship was heading straight towards the stone barrier and quickly turned the rudder, causing the bow to swerve to the left. However, the stern was unable to avoid the barrier, and the bottom of the ship rubbed against the stone barrier, causing a small hole to form in the right side of the third hold of the stern. Seawater immediately flooded in. After learning of this, the ship's owner ordered the use of three pumps to remove the water that had flooded into the hold. Although the ship suffered minor damage, it did not affect its sailing, so it continued to move forward along the Huangpu River and arrived at the Bund Park Pier on Beijing Road at around 2 AM, where it docked. The goods in the third hold were slightly damp. The company has decided to start salvaging operations today. The ship was originally scheduled to depart from Shanghai for Ningbo today, but the schedule has been changed, and it will enter the dock for repairs. Regarding the tickets that have been sold, the company posted a notice yesterday stating that refunds would be allowed, and tickets could be exchanged for tickets on the Deping ship. As a result, the Deping ship was delayed until 3 PM today before leaving the port and sailing to Zhenhai.</p>

All the rickshaw pullers, forced by their livelihood, had to reluctantly resume work at 1 PM in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Vessels sailing directly to Ningbo often find themselves unable to exit due to the shallow water during low tide and have to stay overnight in Zhenhai. Fearing that goods and passengers may secretly board or disembark at night, it has been ordered that all vessels should wait for the tide before setting sail.</p>

<p>Ding Guanghong, a Suzhou native residing at No. 37, Lane 70, Xipushi Road, is 23 years old. His brother and classmate Yin Yi (13 years old) are both elementary school students. At 11 AM on the 20th, they were driving back and forth on a bicycle at the intersection of Pushi Road and Saporse Road, playing. At that time, a young Russian woman was passing by in a rickshaw. While sitting in the rickshaw, she took off her gloves, accidentally causing the diamond ring on her finger to fall to the ground. Ding and Yin, two elementary school students, spotted it and picked it up. The diamond was worth 20,000 yuan. Ding took it back to Ding Guanghong, who took it to a pawnshop for appraisal. The pawnbroker estimated the value at 2,000 yuan, but a shop guarantor was required for the transaction to be completed. Ding was unable to provide a guarantor. Later, Ding sold the diamond to a jewelry store in the Jing'an Commercial Center for 4,000 yuan. The store paid 2,000 yuan in cash and a check for 2,000 yuan with a one-month term. Later, Yin Yi's family was dissatisfied because they did not receive a share of the money and reported the information to the French police for investigation. After discovering the loss at home, the owner also reported to the police to investigate and arrest the suspects. Upon receiving the report, the police head dispatched Detective Kang Hui to arrest and detain Ding Guanghong and recovered the stolen goods. Yesterday afternoon, they were sent to the Criminal Division 8 of the Second Special Court. Judge Qiu interrogated them. The police lawyer stated that the defendant was under investigation for embezzling lost property and requested a postponement. The defendant, Ding Guanghong, admitted that his brother picked up the diamond and sold it and hired a lawyer for defense. The hearing was adjourned to the morning of the 27th, and the defendant was released on bail. The stolen goods were returned to the original owner.</p>

<p>A Chinese man named Rong Zengxiang was found murdered in cabin 114 on the Japanese ship Hakone Maru around 11 PM on the 22nd. His body was covered in wounds, and a hemp rope was tied around his neck. The details have been reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that after the case occurred, the police concentrated on the lower-ranking crew members of the ship to start the investigation while inspecting the ship. An examination of the deceased's wounds revealed that he had been beaten to death by the murderer with an iron bar. Then, they discovered that the door to cabin 116 next to the room where the incident occurred was tightly closed. They knocked on the door, but there was no response for a long time, which aroused strong suspicion. They immediately broke down the door and found a Japanese sailor named Tejima Kaneo (22 years old) from Yokohama inside. They also found clothes covered in bloodstains and arrested Tejima. He confessed after a question and admitted that he had lured the deceased into the room and beaten him to death.

<p>From the pathology of venereal disease, it is best to treat it in its early stages because the virus is still shallow and easy to deal with. However, most patients are afraid to speak out because they are ashamed and secretly choose their own medicines. Patients are not all knowledgeable in medicine, so how can they start? Famous medicine "161" Jun Fa Ke Xing is a bacterial antitoxin preparation. After taking it, the medicine directly reaches the affected area and can effectively kill bacteria. Its diuretic, analgesic, anti-inflammatory, detumescence, bactericidal, and cleansing powers are incomparable to ordinary old-fashioned preparations. Moreover, after recovery, the test is non-toxic and can still reproduce normally. A free test coupon is included in each box to ensure credibility and guarantee. It is truly a special and effective holy medicine for secret self-treatment. Each box costs four yuan. Mild cases can see results with one box, and severe cases can be cured with two boxes. The general store of Chinese and Western pharmacies, as well as major pharmacies such as Jihuatang and various fire companies, all sell it. Produced by Shanghai Yuanhua Pharmaceutical Factory and managed by Minghua Trading Company.</p>

<h3 id="e105">Reverse Ethics of Parricide Case - Appeal Debate Concludes - Sentencing Set for the 30th of This Month <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>The parricide and reverse ethics case that shocked the nation, the first trial verdict, the unfilial son Zhou Qinji and Zhou Qinxiang, jointly murdered their direct lineal ascendant relative, each sentenced to death. Their mother, Zhou Jing, was sentenced to two years and six months for assisting in destroying the corpse. Because the defendants disagreed with the verdict, they hired lawyers Ting Yanglinzhi, Ye Shaoying, and Yang Sicheng. Zhou Jing hired lawyers Jiang Panfan and Jiang Baozhou to appeal to the Second Branch of the High Court. They argued that the appellants all suffered from hereditary mental illnesses and expressed dissatisfaction with the forensic鑑定 report, requesting another鉴定 from a different institution. This newspaper has already covered all of these developments. Yesterday afternoon, another court hearing was held, the second such 合 court hearing, at the First Special Court, Jiang Road Criminal Court.</p>
<p>The courtroom was extremely crowded with men and women listening to the trial. Before 2:00 PM, the courtroom was full. The female protagonist, Zhou Qinzhu, dressed in a blue cheongsam, covered with a green short coat, and white leather shoes, appeared calm. She sat silently in the audience with relatives. All the Chinese and Western judicial police of the special court were dispatched and distributed inside and outside the courtroom. Anyone without an audience ticket was denied entry. At 2:30 PM, the lawyer of the patrol room, Gan Jingxian, and the appellants' lawyers, Ye Shaoying, Yang Sicheng, and Jiang Pingfan, arrived on time. Presiding Judge Nie Chongyi, along with Judges Shi Meiyu and Jia Zhensheng, and Prosecutor Lin Wopeng, took their seats. First, appellant Zhou Qinxiang was briefly questioned. Then, witness Gui Ren Yang, a native of Wujiang, testified that he was thirty years old. He had been employed by the Zhou family since June of last year until after the incident when Miss Zhou (i.e., Zhou Qinzhu) dismissed him. While working at the Zhou family, in addition to cleaning the rooms, he also helped the wife (Zhou Jing) cook. His bedroom was in the pavilion room upstairs, far from the deceased's bedroom, so he could not hear any conversations, etc. He did not know why the old master (Zhou Yongjie) was killed. The wife usually came downstairs at 10:00 AM because she suffered from heart disease, so she stayed in the kitchen all day until 10:00 PM when she went upstairs. That evening, he went to bed at 10:00 PM and got up at 5:00 AM the next morning. He did not see the old master. According to Xiao A'guan (Zhou Qinji), his father had gone out in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>He did not know anything else. At this point, Judge Nie ruled on the appellant's claim for an appraisal in full, saying, "The application is rejected." And because the facts were clear, he ordered the debate to begin. First, the Public Works Bureau's agent lawyer, Gan Jingxian, said, "Upon investigation, the evidence regarding the appellants Zhou Qinji and Qinxiang's involvement in the murder and destruction of the corpse is solid. The circumstances of the crime and the facts are consistent. The patrol room has thoroughly investigated the shops where the appellants purchased the items. The items were jointly purchased by the two appellants, which is clear evidence and leaves no doubt. As for the age issue, during the appeal hearing, they suddenly reduced their ages by three years. I don't know what the purpose is. It should be known that the criminal law clearly stipulates that anyone under the age of eighteen does not apply to the crime of killing a direct ascendant relative. As for the claim of mental illness, it has also been</p>
<p>medically proven that they are no different from ordinary people and are not in a state of mental impairment. The motive for their crime is not limited to abuse of their mother. Because the deceased had some property, the appellants stole banknotes and money after the deceased's death, implying a case of murder for money. According to the crime of robbery and murder, they should also be sentenced to death. Moreover, the circumstances of this case are serious, killing a direct ascendant relative and dismembering the corpse, intending to destroy the corpse and eliminate the evidence. This is outrageous and infuriating. Since the establishment of this court, this case is unprecedented and the circumstances are abominable. Our country has always valued etiquette and ethics. This giant case of reverse ethics, using scientific new methods to kill with electricity, is unforgivable in terms of law and human sentiment. As for Zhou Jing's part, the original trial sentenced her to two years and six months for assisting in the destruction of the corpse, which is already an act of leniency, reducing the sentence by one degree. The appeal should be rejected and the original verdict upheld." Then, appellant's lawyer Ye Shaoying said, regarding the part of appellant Zhou Qinji, the original trial's determination of the facts was based on (1) Zhou Qinji's confession, (2) the statement of co-defendant Zhou Qinxiang. The confession was not a directly questioned and recorded statement, and its nature clearly does not comply with the provisions of Article 270 of the Criminal Law. Upon investigation, at the opening of the appeal trial, Zhou Qinji consistently denied that he had participated in the murder, while his brother Zhou Qinxiang directly admitted that the case was his own doing. The patrol room cannot prove that Qinji had any complicity, and he should be declared innocent. As for Zhou Qin’s</p>
<p>confession, he admitted to the criminal facts, but regarding whether he has a mental illness, according to the last paragraph of the forensic report, it states that he has a low-grade mental illness. This lawyer requests another鉴定 which was not approved. Therefore, regarding the criminal facts, although he did not legally reduce his sentence, etc." Then, appellant's lawyer Yang Sicheng continued the debate, saying, "There are as many as thirty-five types of crimes listed in the criminal law. According to criminal statistics, although murder cases are not the least, they are not the most either. Killing a direct ascendant relative is especially rare. The reason is that human love is greater than that for parents and children because children are the spiritual sustenance and material successors of their parents, with only happiness and no conflicts of interest. Therefore, society can be indifferent to killing an ordinary person, but killing a direct ascendant relative is considered</p>
<p>a world-shattering event. This attitude fully expresses the good ethical spirit of filial piety first for thousands of years. Furthermore, according to legal regulations, killing an ordinary person and a direct ascendant relative are both murder crimes, but the punishments are different. Especially the age of the crime, Article 63 of the Criminal Law stipulates that anyone under the age of sixteen who commits a crime shall not be sentenced to death or life imprisonment, but this restriction does not apply to killing a direct ascendant relative. It can be seen that legislation values filial piety. However, the current criminal law does not adopt absolute death penalty for killing a direct ascendant relative like the old criminal law, but still has life imprisonment as an optional sentence. Article 57 of the Criminal Law stipulates that the motive, purpose, character, living conditions, and knowledge level of the offender must be</p>
<p>taken into consideration. On the surface, the appellant killed the victim in this case, but in fact, the result of this case was caused not by the appellant, but by the victim. Moreover, the victim's death was not a killing, but a death from illness. If you ask what kind of illness, (1) mental illness, (2) a bad marriage illness. Regarding whether the deceased had mental illness, it can be observed from his pre-mortem treatment of people and things. Moreover, in previous trials, the appellants' testimonies and the previous testimony of witness Chen Renmei all stated that the deceased had a bad temper, ignoring the crowd, and the relationship between husband and wife and father and son was as cold as ice. These are all symptoms of mental illness. As for the bad marriage, it is well known to relatives and friends that appellant Zhou Jing had a bad relationship with the deceased, often beating and scolding him. When in Fengda, the man had a mistress. Appellant Zhou Qinji, etc., stated that Zhou Jing had heart disease and wanted to drink porridge, but the deceased insisted that she eat rice. Zhou Jing wanted to close the window because of illness, but the deceased insisted on opening the window.</p>
<p>Such things are endless. After twenty years of marriage, there has never been a good feeling. Now everyone hates the appellant's cruel and despicable methods, and the original trial's death sentence is perfectly appropriate. But if we still have human sympathy, we must also say something fair. They were created by the two illnesses of the deceased, the victims of a cold family, not the destroyers. Because everyone in the world has desires, and their minimum desire is to achieve survival satisfaction. Now the appellant's family has encountered coldness and has a terrible father, living in hell with no joy, and the mother is also abused, and there is a great possibility of not being able to survive. In order to save their mother, they did not hesitate to take improper measures, creating the motive for this case,</p>
<p>and a reduced sentence should be considered," etc. Then, Zhou Jing's defense lawyer, Jiang Pingfan, argued that the original trial sentenced her for assisting in the destruction of the corpse, and the important evidence adopted was a foreign terrace key found by her side. When the patrol room detectives went to knock on the door, the appellants Zhou Qinji, etc., came downstairs to open the door. At that time, the foreign terrace door was not locked at all, and Zhou Jing was arrested in the kitchen downstairs, and there was no assistance in destroying the corpse. She should be declared innocent," etc. Judge Nie核供 announced the end of the debate in this case, and the judgment will be announced at 2:00 PM on the 30th of this month. The appellants were still detained separately.</p>

<p>Zhang Shiqi, a Wuxi native who serves as the manager of the Jingyong 洋钉 factory at No. 6 Longfuxing, North Zhejiang Road, recently accused his accountant, Zhang Baoling, of embezzlement, destroying account books, forging seals, and embezzling more than 3,000 yuan in payment for goods. The shareholders discovered this and reported it to the patrol room, which sent detectives to arrest the two defendants at No. 4, Lane 852, Xinzha Road, and No. 7, Lane 727, Tiantong Road. Sixteen account books, eight checks, seven seals, and about 3,000 yuan in stolen money were seized.

At 6:15 AM on the 20th of this month, while Tong was driving truck No. 2250, when turning from Luban Road into Wangzhi Road, due to excessive speed, six workers on the truck were thrown off, and one of them, Wu Wentong, died because his head was facing down. Another, Ji Zitou, only injured his leg and recovered after bandaging. He was escorted to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special Court by the patrol room for questioning. After Judge Sun Pengwei questioned him, he adjourned the trial to the 26th for further questioning. The defendant was not allowed bail and was detained.</p>
<p>He Wansheng, a Suzhou native and leader of a pickpocket gang, on the 15th of this month, pickpocketed more than 500 yuan of national currency from the bag of passenger Lu Huizhong (resident of No. 12, Lane 1125, Yuyuan Road) on the No. 22 bus. He was caught red-handed and arrested, and was escorted to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Court, where he was prosecuted for theft. The trial was continued yesterday morning, and the trial was adjourned to May 13 to summon the victim for further questioning. The defendant was remanded in custody.</p>

<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>According to the statement of the person concerned, Chen Zhaoxi, "Upon reading the report in Shenbao regarding Chen Zhaoxi's bigamy and fraud, the content is inconsistent with the facts. Chen Zhaoxi's marriage to Wang Meng took place after his divorce from Jin Suhua, so there is no bigamy. As for whether there is fraud or adultery, there are facts and laws to be revealed. However, this case has not yet been judged, and it is biased to adopt only one side of the story for dissemination, which is indeed confusing to the audience. Please send a letter on my behalf to request a correction," etc. Based on this, we are sending this letter to you for correction. Lawyer Wang Liwu, April 24.</p>

<p>Grain from Grass</p>
<p>In Shijiaowei, Qingyuan Prefecture, there are several hills, covered with grass from the foot to the top, with almost no empty space. Last month, each blade of grass in the hills grew a string of grain, no different from rice. It was harvested and cooked, and its sweet and fragrant taste was the same as rice. The villagers there spread the news of this strange phenomenon, and everyone far and wide knew about it, and those who went to harvest it were constantly on the road. Later, when the authorities became aware of it, fearing that the people would compete for harvesting and cause disputes, they immediately sealed it off, hired people to harvest all of it, and the resulting grass grain, three or four thousand catties, was all stored in the official granary.</p>
<p>Strange Events in Huizhou</p>
<p>In Jiazibu, Huizhou Prefecture, Guangdong, it was heard that on the 28th and 29th of last month, fishermen caught more than five hundred fish heads in their nets. Although there were no bodies or tails, some were connected to intestines and stomachs, as if they had been cut with a knife. However, they were not rotten. At first, the fishermen were startled and threw them into the water. Later, because they were readily available, they took them to the market to show the public. Some brave people cooked and ate them, and there were no other problems. It was also heard that in Hudong, thirty miles away from Jiazibu, fishermen also caught more than one thousand four hundred fish heads in their nets. Also, last year, in a certain night there, the land suddenly became bright, and the residents saw the sunrise, and it soon fell, and was followed by angry lightning.</p>
<p>Thief on Maple River</p>
<p>A certain farming family in Fengxi, Wu, had a lot of money. Recently, there have been repeated thefts. Therefore, they hired three or four people to take turns guarding the night. Before the fourth watch the other day, they heard a rustling sound on the eaves. They rose up to pursue and capture, and saw a person jumping down into the courtyard. He was less than three feet tall, wearing printed cloth padded trousers, and was a child of ten or more years. The crowd raised their hands to grab his sleeves, but he knocked them open and fell several feet away. When they tried to go forward again, the child had already crouched down and jumped onto the roof and disappeared.</p>

<h3 id="e110">Doctors Who Benefit Humanity <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Wu</p>
<p>The progress of modern medicine has reduced the suffering of patients and has allowed for the use of various preventive methods to prevent the spread of diseases. Diseases that could not be cured before can now be treated with new methods, allowing the sick to recover. This is a great blessing for modern humans. It is the medical researchers who diligently work in the laboratory, the doctors who selflessly save the world and serve humanity, and the nurses who provide this happiness to mankind.</p>
<p>We should be most admiring, respectful, and grateful to these people. The gradual reduction in the mortality rate in civilized cities and the annual decrease in the number of people suffering from diseases are all the results of their efforts.</p>
<p>Occasionally, we see the life stories of these individuals in biographies or other books, and their awe-inspiring will and spirit are enough to make us yearn for them for a long time and remember them for life. Not long ago, two films were shown in Shanghai, bringing the facts of the lifelong struggles of two doctors to the screen, and I was deeply moved after watching them. These two films are: "The Citadel" and "Glorious Memories."</p>
<p>Of these two, the latter made a deeper impression on me. This doctor worked hard for decades, dedicated to serving the poor, not greedy for profit, not caring about slander, and doing what he believed was right. His compassionate love and perseverance were enough to "illuminate the four corners of the earth" and be immortalized forever.</p>
<p>Looking back at our country, not to mention the backwardness of medical skills, this spirit is almost "one in a million." Of course, there are also many doctors abroad who only seek profit, hang up their signs, set prices, and wait for patients who can afford the consultation fee to come for treatment, rather than automatically running around to serve patients. But why not compare and compete with these great doctors?</p>
<p>In modern society, the best doctors are not just those with high medical skills and complete equipment, but those with compassionate and loving hearts who are willing to serve others. They are always concerned about the health of the public and give the greatest happiness to modern humans.</p>
<p>Abroad, many cities and towns now have public hospitals or private hospitals dedicated to benefiting the poor. Most doctors with high medical skills also volunteer to work in hospitals, preferring to earn less themselves, but they are much happier in spirit because many strangers thank them and bless them behind their backs.</p>
<p>Although there are a few such hospitals in China, they are too few in comparison. What's more, our people's physical constitution is not as good as foreigners, and the rate of disease is several times higher than theirs, so it is far from sufficient.</p>
<p>Once, I stumbled in school, broke the skin on my hand, bled, and the wound had some dirt. Because I was far from home and had classes at school, I was afraid that if I waited too long, germs would get in and cause inflammation, so I ran to a nearby medical clinic to ask the doctor to wash it and apply some medicine. This procedure would only take two minutes and the cost of the medicine would only be two cents, but they insisted on charging me a medical fee of $1.20. As a result, I preferred it to become inflamed rather than wash it. Later, it turned out well and did not become inflamed.</p>
<p>This experience made me even more aware of the greatness of the old doctor in "Glorious Memories."</p>
<p>Originally, serving humanity is a doctor's duty, but now, doctors who serve humanity are considered to be the best doctors.</p>
<p>However, doctors who only seek profit will be eliminated, just like the "imperial physicians" of the past.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Cause of Death <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>— Po Linshan</p>
<p>According to American statistics, the following nine conditions account for 72% of the leading causes of death in Americans:</p>
<p>(1) Heart disease.</p>
<p>(2) Common cold and pneumonia.</p>
<p>(3) Anthrax and malignant tumors.</p>
<p>(4) Kidney inflammation.</p>
<p>(5) Cerebral hemorrhage and softening of the brain.</p>
<p>(6) Pulmonary tuberculosis.</p>
<p>(7) Children born with deformities, or infected with germs shortly after birth.</p>
<p>(8) Being crushed by a car, or encountering other accidents.</p>
<p>(9) Diabetes.</p>
<p>Among them, heart disease, which occupies the top spot, is indeed a very terrible executioner for mankind. In 1937, 346,401 Americans died from heart disease. About 33.9% of people around the age of sixty die from heart disease. Its threat to boys aged ten to fourteen is only rivaled by item eight and enteritis.</p>

<h3 id="e112">Toads Contribute to the World <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>— Fangren</p>
<p>Whenever the word toad is mentioned, who wouldn't shake their head and frown, immediately thinking of its ugly appearance. But it is this object of ridicule that can sacrifice its life to add a layer of protection to human life. Because the medical community has recently discovered that the poison it secretes can treat cancer, and it has been successfully tested.</p>
<p>About a year ago, French doctor Ke Nailiu published his experimental results, saying that the poison secreted by a gland under the toad's chin can help the human body to resist pain. But at that time, most people were unwilling to believe it and did not pay attention to it. It was not until recently that the Institute of Immunity admitted that Dr. Ke Nailiu's experimental results were indeed true. Originally, the institute's research on resisting cancer had been carried out by researcher Pei Long twelve years ago. However, because no factual basis had yet been obtained, it has always remained silent.</p>
<p>Pei Long's research began by examining whether animals also develop cancer. After a long period of experimentation, he found that snakes also develop this disease, and after examining four thousand vipers (a type of poisonous snake), not a single one had even the mildest form of cancer. In addition, he examined three thousand toads and one thousand eight hundred frogs. As a result, dozens of frogs suffered from this disease, while toads, like vipers, did not suffer from this disease. Based on the above-mentioned experiments, Pei Neng believes that the venom of frogs, snakes, and toads is indeed a good medicine for resisting cancer. Furthermore, because the effectiveness of the latter's secretion is even greater, he decided to use it exclusively to try to develop an antitoxin for treating cancer.</p>
<p>The preparation of the test has now been completed, so the institute also published the results, which are consistent with Dr. Ke Nailiu's experiments. It is said that this injection made from toad venom can not only treat various cancers, but also has the effects of strengthening the heart, maintaining the balance of the nervous system, and stimulating glands.</p>
<p>The Chinese medical community had already discovered that toad venom can be used in medicine. According to the Ci Yuan and Ci Hai, its name is "Chanshu". And the method of making it is transcribed from the Ben Cao as follows: "There are different methods for obtaining Chanshu. One method is to pinch its brow ridge with your hand to extract the white juice; another method is to put spicy things such as garlic and pepper into its mouth, and the toad's body will naturally produce white juice from its eyes. Scrape it off with a bamboo spatula, mix it with flour to form a block and dry it, which can be used in medicine." But it does not say what diseases it mainly treats. Later, the author asked someone to ask a state-owned enterprise, and according to his report, "Chanshu is not used in prescriptions, but is often used in pills and powders, such as those for warding off plague. Therefore, it is an adjuvant, with many effects, but it is not used alone."</p>
<p>However, regardless of whether the Chinese medical community was the first to discover it, as far as the author knows, it is probably just the prototype of the initial invention and has not been further studied. Now that others have studied it more clearly and intelligently, let them catch up from behind. However, in the future, the author hopes that domestic professional researchers will also pay attention to Chinese medicine. If they can find a clue like "Chanshu" and then improve it, wouldn't it be more meaningful and valuable than picking up other people's wisdom and only seeking to make money?</p>
<p>Education</p>
<h3 id="e113">Nude Infant Education <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>— Qing</p>
<p>In recent years, the world's educational theories have not only made significant progress, but also, due to the advancement of human civilization and the development of scientific life, many educational methods that were previously considered bold and fanciful are now able to be put to the test.</p>
<p>The nude kindergarten in London is adopting this educational theory to allow innocent and lively children to break down the ambiguity surrounding the human body and use the natural environment—sunlight, air, water—to provide them with a completely healthy and happy life education.</p>
<p>This nude kindergarten completely takes "freedom and health" as its main educational goal. Although their curriculum standards are not much different from those of infant education in other countries around the world, their educational methods are very novel. They do not have rigid class schedules or textbooks. Students are free to choose the books they like as knowledge textbooks.</p>
<p>Apart from a certain order in daily life, diet, and daily activities, other aspects of life are very free. After each student enters the school, they can choose an educational toy that they love. Whether they play with this toy alone or in a group, it is up to their own freedom. The teacher's task is only to be responsible for taking care of them. However, at the appropriate time, they will instill life knowledge and learning into them anytime, anywhere, so that they receive a good education without realizing it.</p>
<p>According to experts' research, the greatest advantage of this type of education is that it not only improves children's physical strength and skin resistance, but also has great benefits in terms of intelligence.</p>
<p>At the same time, children's sensitivity is particularly strong. If they are given a frank and bright concept of the human body before elementary school age, it can break down the ambiguous psychology they might have towards the human body in the future.</p>

<p>In Rome, there is a unique hospital in the world. The patients who patronize it are all books and documents. If any valuable ancient books or documents suffer from diseases such as breakage, mildew, stains, or worm damage, they only need to be sent to the hospital, where pathology experts will be responsible for treatment. The treatment procedure generally involves disinfecting them first, and then conducting a detailed diagnosis of each page and part. If any stains or injuries are found, they will be removed with medicines or surgery. After the treatment is completed, they will be elegantly bound and escorted out of the hospital, and it can be guaranteed that there will be no risk of re-infection for a certain period of time.</p>

<p>The world today is a madhouse, full of noise, instability, and meaningless clamor. Modern life is so complex and so hurried that most people are swept forward by the tide of everyday affairs, hardly knowing why. People desperately seek pleasure, blindly chase the crowd, and make whimsical sacrifices. A family is no longer his palace; radio broadcasts intrude into his residence, reporting everything in the world, from business to jokes in bed, filling the home with everything. Therefore, one of the most difficult things to do in the world today is to have a small, quiet room. Life is moving at high speed, people only think about the headlines in the newspapers, and are controlled by their nerves or techniques, and there is simply no time to think, and not from their own opinions, to reach some kind of rational conclusion. Because of this clutter, confusion, hurry, and lack of clear and broad thinking, modern life is too focused on material values. We are so foolish as to believe that the most obvious sign of good people is how much property they have or how much money they have in the bank. Many inventions and massive production have caused too many goods to pile up in front of us, so that we often regard a person's wealth as a sign of his success. As critics say, "Salesmen say that the success of family life depends on buying a new car every spring, and they also tell us that labor-saving inventions will surely make us happy, and fashionable clothes can make up for the lack of character. All you need is new furniture to decorate your home into a satisfactory home." Such advertisements will surely make people feel that if they have sufficient material possessions, they will be infinitely happy. In this noisy chaos, we take the thoughts of the crowd as our own, forget our own self-confidence, and generally accept the ideal of judging people's success or failure by their property. Who would have thought that just as this concept was gaining momentum, we would suffer the greatest economic depression in history, banks collapsed, the stock market crashed, and the material structure was destroyed. Then, the old religious saying, "A man's life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions," once again shone the light of truth on the world. Following this economic depression, we also see a kind of spiritual depression, which is; people deceive themselves, to convince themselves, that comfortable methods can make life great, and comfortable methods can make life noble. Having money is more important than earning it by one's own efforts, and entertainment is higher than respect and virtue. People do not believe in each other, do not believe in anyone's character, and also doubt the value of their own social system.</p>

<h3 id="e117">Kissing and Beards <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>— Yong</p>
<p>Max Factor likes to collect all kinds of interesting questions in Hollywood. Recently, he asked the beauties in the film city such a question: When you need to kiss on the silver screen, do you prefer someone with a beard or without? Here are their various answers:</p>
<p>Carole Lombard said: "I don't object at all to kissing male stars with beards; because my husband is one." (Note by the author: Carole Lombard's husband is Clark Gable.)</p>
<p>Rosalind Russell said: "I absolutely don't want to kiss people with beards, especially on the screen, and especially those with fake beards."</p>
<p>Binnie Barnes said: "The question of kissing and beards doesn't matter to me. But there is one thing that I have in common with Rosalind, and that is that I also hate kissing a star with a fake beard."</p>
<p>Ginger Rogers said: "Whether for artistic reasons or for work reasons, I would never want to kiss someone with a stiff and prickly beard."</p>
<p>Ann Sheridan said: "From the perspective of pure art, I think it is a humiliating job to kiss someone with a beard, whether it is Hitler-style or Chaplin-style."</p>
<p>Bette Davis did not express any opinion on this question, but she told Max: "Because I have a very ticklish upper lip, so, when I encounter things like beards, it often makes me emit a kind of ruthless smile; for this reason, the director always prevents me from kissing male stars with beards."</p>
<p>According to Max's final investigation, there is only one actress in Hollywood who really likes to kiss general movie stars with beards, and that is Steffi Duna.</p>
<h3 id="e118">After Listening to "The Pearl Mark" <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>— Ji</p>
<p>A few days ago, Huang Guiqiu posted "The Pearl Mark", and there was also Yan Shishan's "Xiangjiang Meeting" in the front court, which is a rare good play. I went to see it, but the Xiangjiang Meeting had already come to an end, which was a pity.</p>
<p>The play "The Pearl Mark" is adapted from the old play "The Shepherd's Scroll", and was revised by Cheng Yanqiu, adding a beginning and an end. This play also stars the male lead Zhu Chundeng, so bearded actors such as Tan Fuying also perform this play. On this day, Zhu Chundeng was played by two actors. The first half was played by Song Yuchun. There is nothing good to say about the first half.</p>
<p>Huang Guiqiu's Zhao Jintang places equal emphasis on singing and acting. After the reverse clapper "Sigh, my husband lost his life, tears filled my cheeks", there is still a sentence of "Jiong Long", and after "Jiong Long" is "Crying Head", but on this day, as soon as Guiqiu's reverse clapper was finished, the "Crying Head" actually started on the stage. Fortunately, Guiqiu was alert and quickly hinted at the stage, so that Jiong Long could pass. Otherwise, I would have to smash it. Then he sang the original clapper, and the four characters "Life to the Yangtai", Guiqiu used a tune like the one in Lanfang's "Phoenix Returns to the Nest" which was extremely beautiful. After that, every phrase and tune was wonderful. After this section was sung, it was the "Song Family Forcing Marriage" scene. The person playing the Song family was a new member of the cast, and I don't know their last name. When beating Jintang, there were three phrases of rocking clapper, and what the stage was playing was Xipi, but the performers sang Erhuang loudly. The old female singer who sang the fourth phrase sang Xipi again, making the singing unclear. Liu Zhenting, who played the old female role, was also quite competent. After this scene, Zhu Chundeng was victorious and ennobled. Da Yuan took the stage, performing very hard, and his voice was also very good. In the crying scene, there was a large section of reverse Erhuang, and he was able to cope with it well, and there were many good tunes. The phrase "What official are you doing" was raised in pitch, and there was a wonderful high-pitched singing that reached the clouds. The scene later became "Sacrificing to the Tower", which was one of the most exciting sections of the whole play. In this scene, in addition to the male and female leads, the old female singer, the painted face, and the small painted face were all quite important. After Guiqiu finished singing the reverse clapper sentence "Zhao Jintang kneels on the mat, tears streaming down his face", she sang a slow phrase, and in the sentence "Listen carefully to my description of my home", the two words "Listen carefully" used a high pitch, which was quite good. In the fourth sentence, "My father, Zhao Dutang, is a high-ranking official", she sang with full color. In the sentence "Married to my son-in-law, Zhu Chundeng", after the two words "Zhu Chundeng" were sung, the deputy net who played the flag bearer should have come on stage, tripped Zhao Jintang, and drawn his sword, showing many beautiful gestures (Hou Xirui and Yanqiu were a perfect match for this role). However, Liu Yanting, who played the flag bearer on this day, passed by indifferently, reducing a lot of excitement. In this scene, in addition to the male and female leads and the old female singer, Guan Shengji, who played the small painted face, received full applause for reciting the tongue-twister "The old ones go in, the young ones don't go in". His dialogue and acting were also good. Then he sang the original clapper sentence "Married to my son-in-law, Zhu Chundeng, a marriage of hair", and the four words "A marriage of hair" were another beautiful tune. However, in the sentence "It is written on it that my son-in-law died in battle", Guiqiu used a double tune for the four words "Died in battle", which was the same tune as the four words "Life to the Yangtai" in the first original clapper, which was not appropriate. After Guiqiu finished singing this section, Da Yuan still had a section of original clapper, which was a place for the old male singer to please the audience. The second sentence, "It's like a knife stabbing meat and piercing the heart", was bound to be good, because the old male singers who played this role would surely receive applause when singing this sentence. However, Da Yuan on this day dragged out the two words "Heart Piercing" in this sentence, so he failed to receive applause. This is not to say that Da Yuan was not good, although Da Yuan only had a few scenes, he was not inferior to Guiqiu. I was extremely satisfied after watching it, so I wrote this down in a rambling way.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Cathay Film Company to be Established on June 1 <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>— Hai Xing</p>
<p>According to a certain gentleman close to Zhou Xuan, he told the reporter that Zhou's Cathay Film Company is scheduled to be officially established on June 1. At that time, the two major studios of Guohua should be completed, and Cathay will use the consumer cooperative method to shoot plays in Guohua's new studio. However, the first play has not yet been decided. However, what I can tell the readers is that the plays that Cathay wants to shoot, whether they are historical or modern, must have considerable significance in the script, and will not focus 100% on business considerations.</p>
<p>In terms of personnel, in addition to moderately borrowing a portion of the supporting roles from Guohua, other arrangements will be made independently. The hope is to put together a lineup that can refresh the audience's eyes and ears. It is said that Bai Yang and Gao Zhanfei, who the Shanghai audience has been longing for for a long time, may join Cathay. Bai and Gao were old colleagues when Zhou was in charge of Mingxing, and the two sides have a good relationship. If there are no unexpected obstacles, joining should not be a problem. As for when they will leave Chongqing and come to Shanghai to star in what play, this magazine will be the first to report to the readers. Some time ago, there were rumors that Bai Yang had secretly come to Shanghai, which was completely untrue. As for Jin Suqin's "Wenji Returns to Han", it is also listed as one of Cathay's productions, but it is not the main force for the opening shot.</p>

<p>— Jing</p>
<p>The China Travel Troupe's "New Meiluo Fragrance" was originally scheduled to be performed for one week, but due to its sustained box office success, it was extended to more than ten days. The audience still demanded an extension, but the protagonist Tang Huaiqiu was already setting up a memorial service for his father, so he couldn't perform anymore. It was decided to present the three-act play "Two Worlds" from last night according to the original plan. This play is a work by a first-class domestic writer. When it was performed in the mainland, it caused a sensation. It is a vivid satire on the life and attitude of unscrupulous merchants. The main actors are Sun Jinglu, Lin Na, and Huang He, etc. The director Li Ping also plays a leading role.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Sun Jinglu, the female lead in the China Travel Troupe's satirical comedy "Two Worlds", has performed in plays such as "Sunrise", "The Last Regret of the Ming Dynasty", and "Thunderstorm". <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
