<p>社評</p>
<h3>德國對英國提示息爭</h3>
<p>德國元首希特勒氏前晚對彼國會發表演說，有數語謂「余之良心迫余再度向英國呼籲，賡續戰爭實屬無益；」又謂「倘英人再置不理，則慘劇必將來臨。」此外，復稱述德國軍民之忠勇，德義同盟之密切，蘇德國交之穩固；並於指摘英國擴大歐戰範圍之餘，申述德國國社黨黨綱之一，乃在「用可能之和平方法，要求修改凡爾賽條約；」又申述希氏主安之外交政策，乃在「獲致義國之友誼與英國之諒解，以增進世界之合作」云。此一演說，姑不問其後果何似，固歐戰中之重要節目也。</p>
<p>茲於申論之前，先請抉言二點：其一，據昨晚電傳之演辭概要，希氏建議和平，然於隱然爲世界和平中重要因素之美國，旣無一語道及；而於東京方面營營政潮，所謂强化德義軸心關係之高唱入雲，亦竟未予理會。其二，據昨晚倫敦電訉，英國官塲人士對於此項演說，拒不加以批評；或謂英國具有抗戰決心，且有備無患；然推想英國負責當局當不至「再置不理」，以緘默備戰爲答復歟？如何答復，非但必爲旗鼓相當之偉大雄辯，亦歐局前途所繫，請引領俟之。</p>
<p>此次歐戰之發生，實由悠遠之歷史事實，相激相盪而來：雙方觀點旣殊，論據自異；其間是非曲直，雖留待後世史家，殆亦難得定論。及其演變至於現階段，誠使更就英德雙方之物資，兵源，戰略，戰備，分別比較其豐菲，衡量其强弱，以推斷賡續作戰之如何得失，如何勝敗？則無論交戰雙方，必因意氣所驅，不甘示弱；即在局外論者，或因愛憎參差，亦難愜當；况以戰爭凶危，機宜多端，絕非事前根據紙面數字所得逆覩其結果。邱吉爾氏謂德國進攻，必然敗退；希特勒氏謂英國續戰，必歸毀滅，二人所言，可信其各本自信而皆非虛矯之談；然各以國運作孤注則顯而易見，終必一勝一敗，獨孰勝孰敗爲未可知耳。顧乃德國於屢戰屢勝，進攻英國之前夕，忽以勒馬懸崕之姿態，發爲息戰謀和之呼籲。雖謀和將以何種精神爲出發，何種條件爲基礎，融洽與吾，成就與吾，問題正多；謀和而失敗，不得不復訴之戰爭，則其咎應歸何國，責任尤重；然就現階段而論，不能不謂和戰之選擇，在於英國。英國當局其鄭重玫慮此選擇之責任乎？</p>
<p>英國對德宣戰之論據，吾人熟聞之矣。由彼論據，宜於和戰絕無玫慮餘地；即成敗利鈍在所不計，惟戰而已。雖然，英國論據不有轉變餘地乎？不已有使之容許轉變之事實乎？英國自身不已踐踏轉變之途徑乎？抑英國論據又豈自始一貫乎？我人不欲歷舉自慕尼黑協定以迄東京協定之凡百經過，一一攷核之於英國作戰之論據；我人不欲複述比利時與法蘭西諸國正式政府之代表其國族，退出此戰塲，研求其是否使此論據喪失其爲國際一般之論據；歷舉之，複述之，玫核之，研求之，徒滋痛心，徒滋刺激，不如其已。然在現階段中，德國非已戰勝而脅取城下之盟，英國非已戰敗而提供屈服之款；是應對等謀和者也。希特勒氏旣謂賡續作戰，實屬無益，復謂良心所迫，再度呼籲；夫孰無悲天憫人之懷，試鑒其誠，是應披肝瀝胆以赴者也。謀和或以條件不協而歸破裂，今希氏初未以咄咄逼人之條件，明示英國以必不堪接受；謀和或以敵兵在境而肆要挾，今德軍固猶在英國之海外，和有成議則和，不成則戰；然則接受建議，試覘條件，又有何不可？國際醞釀中之變化，更僕難數，防不勝防；謂醞釀利於英國，竊疑其不然，證以遠東，尤爲顯著。則使歐洲戰爭先遠東戰爭而結束，在英國未謂失歟！</p>
<h3>希特勒以「理智」名義　對英作最後和平呼籲　倘再被拒絕當傾全力一決雄雌　自信戰事終局毀滅者必非德國</h3>
<p>柏林　希特勒昨日午後在國會舉行特別會議時、演說、以理智與常識之名義、對英國作最後之籲請停止勢必使雙方受可怖傷害遭重大犧牲之戰爭、其最後一節云、兩强相爭必有一亡、邱吉爾或信亡者必爲德國、而余則知亡者將爲英國、余此時覺良心上責任所在、爰再度對英呼籲、余非乞憐之戰敗者、但爲以理智名義發言之戰勝者、故余不妨作此呼籲、余未見此戰必須進行之理由、余念凡戰事所需之犧牲輒爲傷感、余亦應爲自己人民挽回戰禍、余知千百萬德國人民皆極盼與無端對我二次宜戰之敵國、解決一切、惟余亦知國內準備犧牲其所有之許多婦女、仍願有所犧牲、邱吉爾或再不理余言、而謂余言乃對己最後勝利有所疑慮發、果爾則余對於未來之事、已可天良無愧矣、追溯已往數月、吾人荷上蒼之庇蔭、大功吿成、咸深感謝上蒼、在吾人艱苦工作中、佑我決心予我指導、至於余個人、上蒼授我以恢復吾人自由與光榮之重任、余尤爲感動云、</p>
<p>希氏發言以前、義外相齊亞諾列座前席、各議員多服戎裝、首由戈林上將致開會詞、對於陣亡兵士備致譽揚、並謂國會代表人民將使陣亡者家屬免於飢寒云、（二十日路透社電）</p>
<h3>希特勒演辭全文</h3>
<p>柏林　希特勒元首昨日下午六時四十五分、蒞臨國會大禮堂、卽宣佈開會、由議長戈林主席、首對陣亡將士靜默誌哀、繼對義大利陣亡將士、尤其空軍總司令巴爾波上將表示哀悼、義大利外長齊亞諾坐於外交席之第一排、希特勒元首於掌聲雷動中起立發表演說、首述召集國會之原因、（一）顯示人民今日所遭遇事件、在歷史上之重大性、（二）感謝吾等忠勇之將士、（三）對於各方作最後的理性之呼籲、</p>
<p>首述戰事起因</p>
<p>希氏力言凡引起此次歷史上空前衝突者、必須認識此種衝突之犧牲、與其起因殊不相稱、易言之、除非起因之中、尚含有其他隱匿之企圖、否則決不值如此重大之犧牲、希氏申明國社運動之對外計劃、在以和平方法修改凡爾賽條約所造成之一切環境、凡爾賽和約不但欲屈辱及歧視日耳曼民族、且對此種有文化之民族欲加以毀滅、國際聯盟不但未能成爲合理修改凡爾賽條約之機關、且反而保障該的之推行、因此國社運動之目標、除對內打倒猶太資本主義者之統治外、對外爲解放德國所受凡爾賽條約之束縛、歷年以來、德國屢决企圖覓致和平方法之修改、當一九三八年九月二十九日慕尼黑協定成立國際合作、解決此項問題稍現曙光之際、英法輿論大譁、斥責政府荏弱、幷詆反對黨有識份子爲德國之「第五縱隊」同時國際財閥僉以爲戰爭可以使彼等貿易繁榮、從而掀風作浪、如英法之鼓動波蘭抵抗、其所受之犧牲以及所得之結果、豈與德國原所要求者相稱、蓋德國於最後關頭所提出者、不過但澤及德國與東普魯士之交通、然而波蘭因受國際鼓勵戰爭者之蠱惑、竟拒絕德國之直議而從事恐怖之戰爭、證以本年六月十九日德國士兵在巴黎車站所抄獲英法最高國防會議驚人的秘密公文、益徵各小國不過英法軍政領袖之工具而已、會憶戰爭揭開之前、美國曾作和平之呼籲、十月六日余（希氏自稱）又在國會提出和平之提議、但英法當局以余爲怯弱而悍然啟釁、張伯倫受鼓動戰爭者如邱吉爾•古柏·倍立厦等之煽惑、公開對余加以汚蔑、於是余乃重整軍旅增强部隊、以担負新的工作、」</p>
<p>德軍先發制人</p>
<p>希氏提及去年冬季因氣候惡劣、暫緩軍舉行動、迨今年三月德國接到情報、英法將對蘇芬戰事有所圖謀、其目的不在援芬而在傷俄因其爲德國之與國故也、當時英法決定于涉蘇芬戰事、俾在波羅的海獲得根據地、並擴大戰爭至巴爾幹及近東、同時爲防止德國之取得瑞典礦苗起見、英法計劃欲進攻瑞典、「當余鑒於北歐捲入戰爭之危機、已經異常顯明、於是向德國軍隊發佈命令、邱吉爾雖欲調兵先進攻德國海軍、但德軍之先發制人、使其完全失敗、此次戰役爲德國軍事史上最勇敢的成就、胥賴海陸空軍將士用命有以致之、</p>
<p>西綫戰略制勝</p>
<p>希氏繼提及西綫戰事、申稱、在挪威戰事尚未結束之前、法國軍隊已開始向法比邊界調動、英法軍隊在與比荷兩國舉行參謀話之後、有向德國工業區進攻之趨向、余乃訓令海陸空軍作一切必要之準備、五月六日七日倫敦巴黎間舉行多次之通話、顯示「協約國」有隨時進攻比荷之可能、余乃於五月八日下令、令德軍於十日拂曉開始攻擊、此次余之戰略、與一九一四年施林芬計劃不同、係側重左翼、對於密集比荷之央法大軍、採取包抄形勢、余之計劃順利進行、希氏詳述法比戰事直至貝當乞降、力言空軍方面得力於戈林上將之指揮得法、厥功獨多、陸軍方面則國防軍總司令季德爾之運籌帷幄、卓著勛績、國內方面更得力於國社黨黨代表赫斯、衝鋒隊參謀長盧滋、政治警察總監希姆萊等之維持贊助、此外如宣傳部長郭培爾、外長里賓特洛甫等均屬功在黨國、勛懋丕著、</p>
<p>將領晋級授勳</p>
<p>希氏於是宜稱、戈林除晋級爲大德國一級元帥外、並頒予鐵十字武士勛章、其他晋級元帥者有下列各將領、（一）國防軍總司令季德爾上將、（二）陸軍總司令白羅傑區上將、（三）軍團總司令隆斯台特上將、（四）軍團總司令李勃上將、軍團總司令波克上將、（五）軍團總司令李斯特上將、（六）軍團總司令克魯琪上將、（七）軍團總司令李奇諾上將、（八）魏勒斯本上將、（九）空軍次長米爾區上將、（十）空軍將領史柏爾將軍、（十一）空軍司令凱斯林將軍、</p>
<p>德義合作滿意</p>
<p>元首提及目前之政治局面稱、其國外之政治　劃、一爲獲得義大利之眞正友誼及諒解、二爲獲得英國之同樣關係、但雖經余之種種努力、終未能得英國之友誼、否則其有造於兩國之前途幸福實至深且大、但余對於第一點之成功、仍引爲深幸、此實應歸功於義大利民挨領袖之天才、當去年英法對德戰事將發生之時、余與墨索里尼曾成立一種協定、爲兩國所應遵守者、德國由義國所持態度之收穫至爲巨大、在經濟上及軍事上同受其利、義國之參加戰事、完全爲其自擇、先在阿爾卑斯山巔作戰，現在則用法西斯之革命精神、發揮海空軍大規模之攻擊、吾人現亦以國社主義之精神追隨其後、吾人在政治上與軍事上之合作堪稱完滿、結果吾人將獲得聯合之勝利、</p>
<p>力能持久作戰</p>
<p>關於目前與將來之局勢、元首稱、依據過去十個月來之種種發展、已證明余所觀察之正確及敵人之錯誤、德國業由勝利而增強、此次德國之損失、比之世界大戰時堪稱極微、挪威之戰以及在荷比法之戰、所損失之數量與出產之總額對比、可謂九牛之一毛、軍火供給之源源不絕、甚至須將出產加以限制、戰爭所需之原料、以煤與鐵而論、雖停止進口、於德國亦毫無影響、至於糧食之豐富、雖戰事如何長久亦所不懼、敵人利用種種宣傳方法、欲破壞德國人民之統一、但人民之態度絲毫不爲所動、十月之戰爭惟有增强人民之決心耳、</p>
<p>德蘇關係友善</p>
<p>希特勒繼述德國對各國之關係、申明德蘇關係業已確定、希望德蘇關係再度緊張者、實爲幼稚之幻想、德蘇兩國均未在波蘭境內採取越出勢力範圍之步驟、</p>
<p>非和平卽毀滅</p>
<p>希特勒追述渠於去年十月六日發表演說、向英法兩國提出和平建議、目前法國對於當時之拒絕和議、已有不同之見解、而英國之政客、並非英國之民眾、尚有繼續戰爭之呼聲、此項政客是否具有繼續戰爭之正確觀念、渠等不惜英國之被佔、然英國民眾不能全部遷往加拿大而將留於英國、邱吉爾宣稱、渠需要戰爭、渠於六星期前已開始對德國平民之空襲、轟炸不設防之城市與鄕村、德國並未加以報復、蓋深知一旦加以報復、則受禍爲英國民衆、屆時邱吉爾及主戰者、必已逃往加拿大矣、邱吉爾至少應信任此次之預言、卽偉大之世界帝國將被毀滅是也、此項世界帝國、德國並無加以毀滅或侵害之意向、戰爭之繼續、必至交戰國雙方之一完全摧毀爲止、邱吉爾以爲德國將被摧毀乎、吾知被摧毀者、將爲英國也、</p>
<p>對英最後呼籲</p>
<p>目前余以爲在天良上、有籲請英國運用常識之責任、余信余可以提出此項呼籲、余因非作戰敗國之呼籲、而戰勝國之理知之言論、余未見有繼　戰爭之迫切理由、余痛惜戰爭所犧牲之將士、余亦希望德國民衆免受戰禍、余知德國之壯丁與靑　、渴望對無故對德宣戰之敵人作戰、邱吉爾或將再度視余之言論、爲懷疑德國最後勝利之表示然至少余對於未來之發展、良心上不致感覺不安矣、希特勒於結束演說時、向爲國效命之將士致其敵意云、（二十日海通電）</p>
<h3>戈林將軍　對英警吿　大戰是否能避免　胥視英態度為斷</h3>
<p>柏林　戈林將軍在國會閉幕之前、曾以議長之資格、向全體議員演說、略謂「一次大戰已告結束、另一偉大戰爭卽將發生到是否發生、則待希特勒之呼籲、是否能得對方之接受、」衆視戈林之文告、係對英國警告「謂希特勒元首準備任何時間向英國施行閃電進攻」、戈氏又稱「德國之戰術、頗似一神蹟、亦爲種種已經稱頌一時之戰爭原則之革命，此項戰術、業已將敵人之種種計畫摧毀無餘、凡德國人民、均信仰此種新奇而具神蹟之武器、現在德國此種新奇之戰術、不特爲德人全體所認識、卽全世界亦莫不識矣」云、（二十日合衆電）</p>

<h3>和平條件　內容推測</h3>
<p>巴斯爾　此間某報駐柏林訪員聲稱、德國對英之攻勢已行展緩、俾可成立試騐一種新政治行動、（二十日路透電）</p>
<p>東京　同盟社往柏林訪員聲稱、衆料今後數日中、歐洲戰事將暫告沉寂、因希特勒須等待英國對於其在國會演辭所發表和平提議之反響也、英國如切實拒絕之、則將見德國以全力進攻英國、就德國一般之情緒而觀、和平條件之內容、似爲（一）邱吉爾及其一派人物之退出英政府、而代之以勞合喬治及英國法斯西領袖摩斯萊爲中心之內閣、（二）裁减英國軍備、並承認一德國之稱覇歐陸、該訪員末稱、英國之將拒絕德方條件、殆可預先斷定云（二十日路透社電）</p>

<h3>德機低翔轟炸　英全境空戰劇烈　德機十一架被擊落　英空軍飛德施報復</h3>
<p>倫敦　德國機羣於昨日之大空襲後、今日又竄入英倫上空、投放炸彈、並於廣大之天空區域、與英戰鬥機作死鬥、據聞此番空戰之烈、爲戰爭以來所未有、今日德機在英境之活動、範圍殊爲遼闊、蘇格蘭之東南與西南上空、英格蘭之西南與東北上空、均有德機發現、並聞密集之高射砲火、蘇格蘭東南某採鏟鎭附近、惟見火光燭天、火勢蔓延、竟有一英里之廣闊、此今日德機襲英之簡單報告也、至於昨日當希特勒元首暗示「世界最恐怖之戰爭」將臨之時、英德空軍、正互相從事猛襲、德國斯都加低翔轟炸機自雲際發見後、卽向英東南部海面、以烈性炸彈擲擊英護航隊、勢如驟雨、而英空軍爲報復起見、亦飛入德境、聞白萊門•哈諾佛威·及愛森等地之工廠及油增、均被炸焚、著名克虜伯砲廠·亦遭轟炸、據英空軍報告、該廠中彈時、爆炸情狀、淸晰可見、昨日德低翔機之森炸英倫海岸、堪稱空前之舉、有力之斯都加低翔轟炸機二十二架、於同一時間、自雲際低翔、大施破壞工作、英海軍高射砲及戰鬥機於德機發見後、卽猛烈抵禦、達數小時不息、斯時沿海一帶惟聞機槍聲、高射砲聲、炸彈聲融成一片、沿岸各鎭玻窗均被震碎、惟未聞有英艦中彈之訊、至英機之轟炸德西北境及萊茵區、範圍亦廣、歷時亦久、據航空部稱、睦爾豪　·潘特邦·羅特倫堡•羅梅滋第福爾茲·及戚塞爾等地之飛機塲、均先後於星期四晚及昨晚被英空軍炸損、哈林登•白萊門及諾威之燃料庫亦被炸焚云、（二十日合衆電）</p>
<p>倫敦　據航空部咋夜公報、昨日午後英國海岸上空有德方轟炸機二十二架襲擊船隻、擲落炸彈的二十枚、英船未被擊中、高射砲向之射擊、卒將德機逐出海外、德機一架之機員一人張傘躍出、相信該機已在海峽中墮落、昨日英戰機與高射砲在英倫東南海岸外、與大隊敵機數度激戰、敵機被英戰機射落八架、被高射砲火擊落一架、另有數機數架受損、綜計昨日敵機被射落十一架、內轟炸機四架戰鬥機七架、（二十日路透電）</p>

<p>倫敦　此間當局昨晚緊隨希特勒元首在柏林議會發表演說後聲稱希特勒元首之「含混和平姿態」、將不爲英國所接受、此間認希特勒元首之演辭、係一不誠意之嘗試、意在引起此間之和平因素、而使英國减低作戰力、（二十日合衆電）</p>
<p>倫敦　路透社外交訪員稱、此間識者認希氏演詞空洞無物、徒對英相大肆謾駡、故不值得官塲之反應、當然英相將在下院陳述其意見、至於希氏演詞有何價值、讀者自能辯之、（二十日路透電）</p>
<p>倫敦　德元首希特勒本日在該國衆院演說發動和議之後、此間觀察家頃加以評論云、英政府殆當提出正式答復、其要旨乃就希特勒所稱英國不惜破壞各小國中立以期擴大戰爭範圍一層加以辯正、此在政界人士則稱、德元首希望中立國出面調處、俾能迅速結束戰事一項願望、已由此項演詞表而出之、但另一部份人士則認爲德國深知進攻英國勢必遭遇重大困難、此項演辭殆欲籲請德國人民準備長期戰爭、至英國官塲人士則對於此項演說、拒不加以評論、僅謂邱吉雨首相業於數日前發表演說、重申抗戰決心、此卽對於希特勒之明白答復、要之、英國已作大規模之準備以對抗敵人之來攻、一切均已有備無患云、（十九日哈瓦期電）</p>

<p>紐約　今日「紐約通報」稱、希特勒昨在國會之演說爲「假慈悲及歪曲事實之傑作」、該報又云、此次戰事不但爲決死之奮鬥、實爲一種英國如獲生存、希特勒主義必遭毀滅之戰爭云、「紐約時報」載稱、希特勒之最後通牒、在形式及實質上、實與前無異、其中包含希氏以前數次所發同樣之僞造歷史云、（二十日路透電）</p>

<p>雪梨　澳洲對於希特勒演說之評論、可於澳首相孟席斯之下列言論中見之、其言曰、以暴虐及流血爲基礎之日耳曼帝國將行毀滅、不但因英國堅持作戰、卽英帝國亦莫不如此也、（二十日路透電）</p>
<h3>加拿大　重申決心　誓為英國後盾</h3>
<p>渥太華　加拿大一般人士相信、希特勒昨日演說中所提之和平建議、未出以值得英帝國考慮之詞句、此項建議意在掩飾德人與中立國人士之耳目、若干觀察家認希氏演詞中、有不久渠將侵犯英國之表示、惟加拿大人民重申且爲英國後盾、至最後一人之決心、希特勒所稱英政府將遷加拿大一節、加人對之、毫無煩擾、蓋加人明瞭英政府苟有此舉、則無非爲賡續作戰計也、（二十日路透電）</p>

<h3>德國戰時民氣</h3>
<p>德國開始作戰的時候，許多觀察家未免爲她婦心，現在經過了十個月的試騐，加以各種戰時困難接踵而來，其情勢倒比最初豫期的希望的甚至認爲可能的，還要好些。德國人民，雖則爲了戰時經濟的困難，到處捉襟見肘，浮言叢起；各種生產及日用品，橫遭政府無情的干涉與統制，尤其在各季，度日如年，幾乎難以忍受。然而他們今日在國社黨的軍政領袖背後，比了已往四年中的任何時期，造成了更堅强的旺盛民氣。因之，德國政府今日所能依賴的人民，其團結一致，堅强不拔，較之開戰的時候，不知要增進多少了。</p>
<p>如拿一個以軍事冒險，來斷定她國家命運的政府而言，德國在開戰之始，其人民情緒的惡劣，可說壞到極點了。非國社黨的德國人，那時大多數對戰爭完全不贊同。這種反對倒並非以道德觀念爲出發點，而係由於厭惡戰爭的可怕。他們實在相信，德國如果作孤注之一擲，恐怕要生還無日哩。歷年以來，國社黨未能把穗國具有强大力量的宜傳，深印入德人的頭腦中。中年人對於上次大戰，與戰後的情况，仍歷歷在目，如何叫他們對於新戰爭不起戒心呢。</p>
<p>在另一方面，德國的官吏，黨軍，和希特勒所領導的靑年，都認這次戰爭不過是德國向外擴張的英雄軍事政策的繼續而已。總之，如果把整個國家來說，去年九月，情勢頗爲危急，到了現在，不顧危難如何，國家已團結一致，人民堅決的情緒，非常高漲。</p>
<p>國內對於國社黨政權的敵意，已自然而然的削弱。除了這個原因，和穗國自信軍事力量之外，另外有兩個因素，値得我們注意。一個就是用政治和警察力量來管理「民氣」組織非常嚴密，效率甚大。已往的十個月中，警察總監希墨萊所造就的偉大的警務力量，自經試騐之後，已證明成效卓著</p>
<p>另外一個，就是自開戰以來德國團結力的開展。德國的大部份民衆都確認這次戰爭，是敵人攻打德國，而不是攻打國社黨。這樣的意見是否能代表一般最有力的見解，或僅僅是一種聰敏而持久宣傳的收穫，姑置不問。不過很可以相信的，就是所聽到的這種見解，不一而足，卽使和非國社黨的德人私下談話，他們都說這次戰爭是英國强之於德開的，德間已受到生命的威脅，被人肆意侵時。他們把世界各國對於德國的嫉妬，恐懼，和猜疑，列舉出來，作為現時狀態的解釋或辯白。他們對於侵略奧國和捷克的罪惡，已淡然忘却，巧爲飾辯，或竟已置諸腦後了。德國人民對於官方所宜布的都加以接受。許多中產階級，與保守性的智識階級，現在也已傾向於反英一途，較之一二年前，他們提心吊膽所表現的反國社黨心理要覺得眞切多了。有些人，有時候被稱爲「較優秀的德人」的，今日大都擁護國社黨政治，這一部份由於自己的信服，一部份由於被迫所致。因為受予了強迫的環境關係，激烈的「愛國狂」已成爲他們信念的中心。</p>
<p>全國團結一致，和從前反對現政府各派的合作，其進行狀態，可從各階級中覘得之。在工人階級中，不顧他們對於戰時困苦的怨憤如何，對於向「英國多頭政治」作戰的必要一點，却毫不感得稍有疑義。德國的工人階級已被當局所說服，幾乎陷入催眠狀態。德人這次作戰是爲「新社會秩序」而奮鬥的一種信念，在大多數人心目中，有意識或無意識的，流傳甚廣。（譯ManchesterGuaodian）</p>
<h3>地中海之鎖鑰</h3>
<p>馬爾太　位於義大利西西里島和突尼斯之間，爲由西地中海至東地中海必經之道，是英國歷來支配地中海的鎖鑰。面積百二十二方哩，人口二十萬餘。全島均由岩石所成，無土壤，由西西里島運來土砂，裁培柑橘，麥，薯，棉等。此島自一七九八年以來，爲法國的領土，一八〇〇年由英國佔領。首府曰拉發勒他，位馬爾太島的東岸。港灣由多數小島抱成，形勢險要，世罕甚匹·英國便在島上　有銅城鐵壁般的　台，並且駐有强力的艦隊。世人稱爲地中海的心臘。</p>
<p>直布羅陀　為西班牙最南端一個小半島面積不過二方哩，與摩洛哥的休遠相對，為地中海的門戶，扼交通的要衝。其中部爲海峽，通地中海與大西洋，長三十六哩，最狹處闊十五哩。此地角三面皆斷崖絕壁，適巨艦停寄，爲天成的要隘。西部爲斜面，　直布羅陀灣，有堅固的磯台。本屬西班牙，一七〇四年以來，即落於英國之手。一七七九年，法西兩國曾聯合海軍攻之，凡四十三月而不下，可見其形勢的險要。現英國於半島東南端風車山，設有强固的要塞及給煤所，並駐有重兵控守。西岸闢軍港以駐軍艦。東與馬爾太相呼應，共爲地中海的海軍根據地。</p>
<p>蘇伊士運河　在亞菲兩洲間，是出入紅海的門戶。當法人雷賽開鑒蘇伊士運河時，英國認爲沒有成功的可能性，完全置之不顧。孰知在一八六九年，好望角便失去重要性，蘇伊士運河居然成爲由地中海通至印度洋的便捷要道。當時法國在埃及的勢力甚爲强大，英即急起直追，不到十五年的工夫，一面因爲英國對埃施用暴烈政策，一面因法國外交應付失宜，蘇伊士運河股東大權，便轉落於英國之手。於是東地中海至印度的航行，完全操在她緊握中。</p>
<p>亞丁　位於阿刺伯半島西南海岸，扼紅海之口。面積僅七十五方哩，人口的五萬五千本爲土耳其所領　一七三〇年獨立，由回敎王管理。一八三六年，英船在其地被掠，回敎王遂割讓於英。至一八三九年，全爲英所有，轄於印度孟買省。地當歐亞兩洲航路的要衝，爲英國的屯煤要港。其西爲巴貝爾曼特海峽的貝林島，面積僅五方哩，屬亞丁管轄，虎踞峽口，扼紅海咽喉。英國於島上築有堅固的要塞，英印交通因以高枕無憂。</p>

<h3>流言利多　金市重振</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市況、事出意外、竟再週末交割日突起買風、得向上游挺進、此因人心受種種多頭流言影響、而所傳和平空氣、今巳完全消弭、更有中蘇軍事同盟、寗波鎭海吿急、更有新中央銀行將開幕諸訊、囂傳市塲、加之本週中之獲利空方巳屆週末、初來傾補、故在大漲小回之局勢下、價巳躍出五千三百元大鬧外、各方人心轉趨堅定、且滙市靜中軟化、金價易高難跌、晨初市象平庸、開盤五千二百三十元、曾因散戶拋塞而跌至五千二百〇五元低價、迨十時半後滙市走緊、證劵幫金號先後入市　購、需要頓增、不久卽衝出五千三百元關外、午刻雖略吿定、惟收盤巳抬至五千三百四十五元、較上日猛升一百二十五元、午後週六無市、半天交易、先淸後旺、約做開二千兩之譜、銀樓飾金掛高十元、海關金等仍平、</p>
<p>烚赤漲一百廿五元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初以銀號出金號十兩、仍為五千二百二十元、較隔昨無分榮辱、繼因證劵幫稍吐、且斯時散戶不乏拋空、遂步小十五元、證劵五金號二十兩、遜為五千二百〇五元、嗣乃某錢兌業突來猛吸、且銀號幫吃胃甚旺、而散戶空頭見景抵補、不久遂拉起五十五元、銀號進錢兌業二十兩、為五千二百六十元、後以某銀號與證劵幫吐出、加之某錢兌業亦稍回吐、遂回小二十元、錢兌業出銀號五十兩、為五千二百四十元、其時市上利多消息頻傳、外滙因之吿緊、塲中買風跟起、證劵幫銀號金號等爭先狂扒、未幾卽衝出五千三百元大關、銀號互做二十兩、為五千三百三十元、斯時買風稍挫、曾見回跌至五千三百十元、惟終因人心向上、低價復來搜買、重再提升三四十元、銀號進金號二十兩、為五千三百四十五元、作午收價、結果比上日軋漲一百二十五元、半天一百四十元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤較高十數元、收進减低三十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十餘元、均鮮做開、</p>
<p>首飾金僅掛高十元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾每兩兌出初時大同行仍懸五百四十元、迨十一時光景、掛大十元、午後則舞變動、計大同行改懸五百五十元、新同行與上價相仿、收進減低三十元光景、</p>
<h3>外幣跌後突漲</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市況、英美金鎊先跌後漲、卒吿各升三元、英金票續有需要、市價仍挺、美金票始因鎊價猛長、晨初供給甚暢、市價退為十六元零八分、嗣忽又傳中蘇同盟、致黑市美匯步縮、正午升爲十六元三角二分、午後稍回至十六元三角二分、比上日仍軋升一角四分、香港票隨港滬匯兌略升一分、坎拿大及菲列濱票均不乏需要、市價一致趨漲、日金票則仍軟弱、晚市為醫院二角一分、朝鮮票供求均勻、晚市仍為一元三分、</p>
<h3>證劵　浮空加碼　內債疲憊不振</h3>
<p>統一公債、昨日暗盤市況、續見萎頓之走勢、再度下降、蓋以浙東形勢緊張、寗波傳說不一、多頭不無戒心、故前幾日　漫之買氣、今突一掃而空、乃投機家與浮空以有機可趁、遂頻頻加碼、大事塞售　乃檯面籌碼充斥、殊有供過於求之象、市氣因此軟化、乃造成成疲豐仁昌聯益五號等尙有納意、故走勢軟中帶定、旋因聯和鴻大永大樂茂等力出不怠、價遂為之壓小、午後市氣淸閑、價格續呈下傾、雖協大六十四號三十五號等頗有供意、　於久豐聯和聯益等之拉提下、稍形回緊、但結果除丁種因供求關係、獨見微好五分外、其他一致續跌二角至半元不等、成交減退、僅約八十餘萬元弱、茲列簡明表如左、</p>
<p>股票交易、寗紹公司股票成交四十股、價為十三元五角、</p>
<p>倫敦十九日（週五）電、今日遠東英商各公司股票掛牌行市、大體均吿平定、祗朝鮮煤礦股跌落二先令六辦士、價為四先令、其餘不動、</p>
<p>倫敦十九日（週五）電、今日中國外債掛牌行市、仍吿平穩、上下檔各債券槪無變動、</p>
<h3>金融述評　—七月二十日止—　法幣發行額的檢討</h3>
<p>— 瓊</p>
<p>中國政府最近公佈二十九年六月底止四銀行法幣發行額是三十九萬六千二百萬元，內中金銀及外匯　　　　十九萬一千七百萬元，佔發行額的四八·四％·這個發行數較之二十八年同期是增五〇·八％，以　二十八年較之二十七年增五二·一％，它的絕對值雖是是增多，相對値顯然是减縮，這是說法幣雖在增加，但它的趨勢已經緩和下來。</p>
<p>因為法幣發行額底增加，一般想中傷的人士，它絕不用理智去分析一下法幣以增加的原因，賀然說中國通貨膨脹，但是在理智的公正的立塲上，決不能說中國通貨膨脹，而僅能說是法幣發行增加。個人是有這樣的幾種觀察：</p>
<p>要了解法幣發行的增加，先要知道戰前法幣發行的情形如何。　實行法幣制度巳來，不過四年半的時期，　這一個時期分成戰前戰時兩個階段來看，法幣發行的趨勢，這兩個階段，在想像中應當要戰時比較戰前發展得迅速，可是在統計分析的結果，完全相反，試以戰前的二十四年十一月作為一百，戰時以二十六年月作為一百，則它增加的進程，戰爭的第一年不過增二成多，二年的時光不到一倍，三年的時光，不到二倍，而在戰前的一年中增一倍多，二年的時光約增二倍，可見法幣發行在戰時的謹愼，中國政府並以增發法幣為戰費的籌措底手段。</p>
<p>戰期中趨勢　戰前的趨勢</p>
<p>或者以戰前是法幣制度正在創立時、戰時法幣制度　經確立來攻擊上面的比較是　　的，那請看下面解釋，法幣制度的創立，無庸諱言的，子啊戰　是沒有成功，它所可以為比較成功的是東南各省及中部幾省，廣泛的西南西北諸省底法幣行使，都在戰事發生之後，最　的事例，便是廣東廣西和雲南都在戰時方開始確實施行，而貴州省府尙在二十七年月通令各縣凡持有銀幣的統限三個月內一律向縣府兌換法幣，可見法幣制度在戰時仍在努力推進，尚未可稱完全成功，猶憶二十八年一月財政部還通令各省政府嚴禁行使銀幣，並規定兌換銀幣增加　續費百分之十五呢！　（未完）</p>
<h3>五金　國貨生鐵無市</h3>
<p>五金交易、因炎夏暑期、兼之交通運輸倍見困難、致各路納胃大减、市况岑寂、人心萎靡、各貨品價格均見回小、生鐵一貨、當不能例外、查生鐵之唯一銷路、為本街鐵工廠、然外幫客商亦有相當納胃、惟近來各幫銷路俱呆、本街方面、只有問津而已、如印貨頭號售六百六十五元、花旗頭號售八百七十五元、（國貨生鐵無市）、</p>
<h3>糧食　米市塲仍有賣空　否則何來空頭急起補空　足見市塲監察徒托空言</h3>
<p>米市自前日晚市一度帶緊後、昨日開手，、人心轉堅、客販方面、不願輕脫、扳售極力、而內地鄕莊客戶及本街店舖等、納意轉濃、於是專事投機之一般空頭、亦亟起補空、全市買氣頓旺、於是售方心望愈堅、喊聲迭高、各色洋米行情步步上升、結果收盤較前回漲一元、計一號陳西貢為五十五元八角、五十五元半、陳二號五十三元、五十二元半、新五十二元五十一元半、一號暹羅五十五元半、五十五元二角二號五十一元半五十一元、火絞五十五元、五十四元半、一號香港尖五十四元半、五十四元、二號五十二元、五十一元半、三號五十元零五角、五十元、小絞尖五十三元、東京　尖四十九元、次至四十六元半、糙尖四十三元半、四十三元、碎尖四十二元、卽廿六號裝船二號暹米開價六十元〇四角、旋自六十元〇五角大至六十一元、亦比前日大七角、二十日裝者、則因貨早抵埠、須付款收現、乃有少數浮戶散多急脫、價乃一度降至五十九元、但因汕幫依然收現、故結果仍回好至六十元、全日成交四百噸、以散戶及補空為主、現米亦有七八千成交、</p>
<p>粳糯米來源仍祗粳千餘包、但銷塲無論明暗、交易依然不暢、蓋以價格高貴、距洋米尙遠、一般作客、對於應付門市猶感不易、是以貨主曾圖與洋米並駕齊驅、一律喊高、而結果終難獲願、僅有三五角上落、開常幫特別鮮淸粳六十八元半、六十七元元、無錫淸粳六十六元半、六十六元、粉粳六十五元、常州蘇崑白粳高六十五元半、六十五元、中關六十三四元、宿次六十元五角、靑泗鮮薄稻六十六元半、六十六元、大市六十四五元、南港鮮早稻六十三元左右、宿六十一元、六十元、斛見五十九元半、溧陽鮮特元六十四元、金壇特元六十三元左右、常丹貨六十一二元、香港白元六十元、</p>
<h3>日廠粉充斥</h3>
<p>麵粉　昨為週末之期、現粉交易、頗為淸閑、查本銷方面、因目下內　粉及日廠粉充斥於市、對於　　粉之需要、無形中　大受打擊、客銷如華北天津等虛、莫不　定洋粉、而當地日　粉亦巳逐漸勃發、故滬上粉市、早落他人之手、昨市二號粉廠盤、仍為十六元、各廠批出約有五千包左右、其他各種　牌粉、成交亦稀、價均萎疲、</p>
<p>小麥　昨交易同區沉靜、因　日虹口到貨、除配解日廠外、大都上棧待沽、華廠方面、欲患廉價購取、殊屬不易、故亦與意黯淡、買賣均在撐持之中、正式市面、恐尙有待也、</p>
<h3>油餅　油市又見回升</h3>
<p>油市自挫跌以來、巳有旬餘、市價雖未若何猛烈、但巳相差五六元矣、故一般人心以為脚地不致一蹶不振、所以前昨兩日各幫吸收頗殷、故行情亦回高元譜、計成交膠州豆油一百件、價為六十六元、烟歧豆油一百件、價為六十九元、膠州生油現貨三百件、路貨五百件、價均為五十八元、煙台生油一百五十件、價亦開五十八元、靑島桶生油六十桶、價為八十五元云、</p>
<p>豆子今日有九百包、運往香港、又二千七百九十包、運新加坡、豆餅二千塊、運往香港、生仁一千三百三十包、運往香港、又一百包運新加坡、</p>
<h3>紗花　紗市浮多　不乏斬結　雙馬跌念餘元</h3>
<p>紗市續挫、且迂迴下落、此因實際銷路太狹、加之漸東局勢不寗、以致人心衰弱、此種情況、尤使多　不安、浮多麼於如斯環境、稍有斬結、惟一般大戶吸收之額、依然按兵勿動、所以市塲上成交日見淸淡、一片渙散之象耳、</p>
<p>現紗晨開、因寗波鎭海軍事緊張、人心大都懷疑、買者又乏生趣、二十支雙馬價為九百二十元、開小十餘元、後以多方喊聲振作、又回漲至九百二十八元、然現紗生意寥若晨星、　面又見鬆懈、市盤復走下風、跌至九百十七元、收盤時間金價回好、提起一步、價為九百二十元、半日間成交統計一千三百七十包、行情而是指雙馬二十一元、今日有紗八十件運海口、又九百四十件運香港、茲將各幫口買去之額量、分列如左、</p>
<p>同行一、一六〇　香港二一〇</p>
<p>統計一、三七〇</p>
<p>棉市難期進展</p>
<p>現棉交易仍屬平凡、此因紗銷凋敝、市價下降、所以廠胃不健、不過有一部份抵解頭　交易、稍有成交、然亦不能牽動大局、因之市面仍乏生色也、加之海外棉市、不脫疲境、人心仍難提昂、大中集一百九十元、成交一百八十包、美棉二百六十元、成交二百件云、</p>
<h3>糖市　關金放長　洋糖隨漲</h3>
<p>昨糖以海關金單位突然放長、本為二·七〇八、今改為二·八七七、合白糖稅須增每擔九角、赤糖六角、故趨勢隨緊、公會劃盤現貨二四粗白、本棧六十八元至六十八、升一元、外棧初為六十六元九角、至六十七元、更至六十七元五角至八角、下午六十六元之六十八元二角、升一元二角、轉口貨以關稅在外、無甚上落、上午五十二元九角至七角半、下午五十三元、三十日交貨五十三元三角、太古車白B嘜西棧七十七元半至七十八元、升一元半、、HX嘜七十五元半升五角、本廠雪白六十八元半升一元、本一號冰九十元、　明冰九十一元半、升半元、國　有廣幫開出東鄕赤百餘包、五十二元至五十二元半、</p>
<h3>疋頭　粵港需貨轉殷</h3>
<p>國布　昨市以沿海被封鎖、鎭海形勢緊急、浙銷一時難期恢復、惟粵港及烟臺幫需貨轉殷、市勢尙稱平定、售盤白布漂染步每疋微廉二角半至五角、烟臺幫辦色布漂粗布近二百件、粵港幫辦粗布粗斜細斜色布三百餘件、內地幫寗蕪等地辦細布色布五千餘疋二百數十件</p>
<p>東布　交易清淡、跌風又聲、十二磅龍頭細布新棧單跌至二十八元四角、老棧單祗二十七元五角、每疋下降一元左右、四君子嗶嘰最小盤售開每碼八角四分半、市氣甚呆疲、</p>
<h3>豐裕白嗶嘰　跌價尙乏受主</h3>
<p>呢羢市面、日來趨勢仍疲、本客需要均懈、零躉交易亦淸、大路標準行盤、莫不明穩暗鬆、豐裕老牌藍邊白嗶嘰、下瀉頗重、原疋現交如有實地受主、賣方俱肯遷就脫手、每碼祗售二十八元半、門市零剪、亦不過售二十九元及二十九元半至譜、按其到埠悞遲、供過於求、實銷過期、深恐明夏貨價難得如今之高、賣買雙方有鑒於斯、致市氣更惡、雖狂跌數元一碼、依然未有出路耳、</p>

<h3>工部局努力　消弭政治暗殺案　總董函促領袖領事注意　請召領團會議俾求合作</h3>
<p>工部局總董凱自威、於本日（二十）致丹麥總領事兼領袖領事一函、略稱、「大美晚報董事張似旭君、在公共租界突遭暗殺、殊深震驚、查四日以前、申報館曾被拋擲炸彈、結巢死一人、傷多人、又上月二十八日晚、國民新聞社長、會於福建路被刺、當後者案發之前、該社曾接獲恐嚇函件、有云、倘冉繼續擁在政策、則將以嚴厲手段對付等語、又本月十六日報載、南京中國政府曾要求本埠外籍記者七人離境、申報發行人阿樂滿君、卽爲其中之一、關於此項報吿之是否確屬、鄙人並無所聞、又咋遭暗殺之張似旭君、爲中華日報所載被南京中國政府通緝之八十三人中一份子、張君之遭暗殺、與上項報吿之登載、似無關係、但其足爲顧慮之事由者、當無疑義、</p>
<p>上海形成犧牲地帶</p>
<p>本局曁所職警務處對於取締恐怖事件、已全力以赴、諒荷洞察、但如政治性之黨派、長此任令作持械犯罪行爲、以求達其目的、則本局暨警務處之力量、將不能底於成功、本局對於犯罪行爲、不論其方式如何、動機何在、由何人所犯、均表扼腕、公共租界在昔堪稱為能合理維持治安之所、各負責人員咸能設法减少犯罪行爲、並維護安寗、第以目前不兩立之黨派、各竭全力、希圖遂其目的、則上海形成一被犧牲之地帶矣、丁茲世界擾攘之秋、極願本埠能成爲一安居樂業之地、</p>
<p>函請召集領團會議</p>
<p>鄙人深信以暗殺而爲武器者、恐無一負責人員能予以贊同也、鄙人忝爲本局總董、職責所在、難安緘默、為此將此種可憾之現狀、函達台端、同時將函稿分送報館、以資刊布、務乞尅卽召集領團會議、並促請各領事與本局合作、俾此類足以摧殘一切自信心暨毀損上海在國際問之令譽之政治暗殺行爲、得以戢止也、</p>
<h3>自來火工潮　仍僵持中</h3>
<p>英商自來火公司虞洽卿路老廠全部工人、前日向公司提出要求改善待遇、被公司當局拒絕復遂發生怠工風潮、迄昨日仍繼續怠工、據平明社記者探悉、公司方面態度堅決、對工人所提出之要求、全部拒絕接受、表示無談判之餘地、並限工人在二十二日上午七時、一律復工、否則作爲自動退職論、勞方則仍堅持原來要求、致雙方意見、未能接近、形成僵持之局、據工人語記者云、自一九三六年英王加冕時、曾加過工資七厘半、不料於上月起此項工資、突被廠方停止付給、此次並附帶要求、請廠方照舊付給、</p>
<h3>菲人關切　獨立問題　亟盼美國協助</h3>
<p>菲律濱商人阿雷納泰、昨日乘亞丹士總統號郵船抵滬、吿記者稱、菲人對於將來泰定斯法案於一九四六年滿期時、國防不復存在一事、深爲驚慮、但任何主張展緩完全獨立之建議、必將來自美國、菲人以前爲</p>
<p>民族尊嚴</p>
<p>而作要求獨立之奮鬥、但今日世界局勢、已非昔比、侵略國家、貧慾正熾、故暫不願獨立、以免獨立得而復失爲侵略國家所噬、吾人求取自由、非爲一時之計、故美政府如提議</p>
<p>展緩獨立</p>
<p>、吾人並不反對、但以種提議、必如果時至一九四六年而不見此種提議、則菲人將處於困難之地位、蓋菲人不能自動要求展延獨立之提議也、據該商人之預料、泰定斯法案、屆時或不至取消、而僅</p>
<p>加以修正</p>
<p>、給與菲人以完全自治之地位但美國武裝軍隊、則仍駐菲島、此種一時權宜之辦法、對美國與菲律濱兩方、均有利而無弊、蓋菲島若無美國、則國防失隳、而美國若無菲島、則其在遠東之貿易、將失去立足之地也、</p>
<h3>日第五縱隊　在港活躍</h3>
<p>由香港乘亞丹士總統號郵船抵滬之旅客、昨對肥者稱、香港居民恐懼日人主持之「第五縱隊」活動、更甚於封鎖或武裝進襲、日軍結集香港四周、如遠東政治情形、繼續不見好轉、則頗足以引起市內之恐怖行爲、香港當局對於此種可能之發展、似已有相當之準備、目下香港純粹經營當地貿易之行號、已因英國婦孺之撤退及一部份華人離港而大受打擊、</p>
<h3>紐約時報記者寓所　昨遭日人搜檢　兩人蒙面持械橫加毆辱　珍貴稿件多種均被刦去　美領將提交涉</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報云、紐約時報駐遠東主任訪員阿朋特、今日（二十日）午夜甫過、在其百老滙大厦第十六層樓寓室中、遭蒙面持械日人兩名、以野蠻手段兇毆、雙手遭日人向後扭轉、而被迫開啟抽屜、內藏阿氏以最先來華之美國軍人華德將軍為題材所著一書之未完成原稿、皆被刦去、今晨阿氏以此事經過詳情、報吿美領署、據駐滬美代理總領事白特列克吿記者稱、渠已接阿氏來函云、聞美領事對於此事將向日當局提出强硬交涉、日方官員今晨謂彼等正偵查此襲擊事、日大使館發言人鶴見憲、亦居百老滙大厦、會於阿氏被襲後、應召前往探視、據鶴見憲今晨聲稱、此事深堪扼腕、日當局已加偵查云、茲記經過如下、</p>
<p>犬聲唁唁忽來怪客</p>
<p>午夜十二時甫過、阿氏在其百老滙大厦寓室中、憑床檢閱新聞稿、忽聞其犬狺狺而吠、繼聞叩門聲、阿氏起身應門、見外立便衣日人兩名、臉蒙手帕、各持手槍、其一身材高大、穿灰色單衫，另一人則短小而屈腿、穿墨綠色上裝及不甚整潔之單褌、各戴低廉草帽、並穿橡皮網球鞋、</p>
<p>電話機綫猛力扯斷</p>
<p>兩日人闖入阿氏寓室前客堂、隨手閉門、其一猛力扯斷牆上電話錢、另一日人則蹴阿氏一犬、兩日人操英語皆流利、向阿氏索取渠正著作中之「反日書籍」原稿、阿氏以渠並不從事此種工作答之、一日人卽以槍指阿氏、勒令導入辦公室、阿氏無奈從之、</p>
<p>一人監視另一搜稿</p>
<p>旣燃燈、較矮之日人監視阿氏、另一日人卽翻閱書桌紙堆、當獲阿氏以華德將軍一生爲題材、將近完畢之書籍原稿、阿氏說明此乃記錄歷史事件之作、而所記之人、逝世已近八十年、惟較高之日人檢閱原稿、發現首頁述及日本、有一九三七年前長江口迭起戰事等言、而在最後數頁、又發現日兵破壞松江華德將軍墓地之記載、</p>
<p>指稱侮辱強迫下跪</p>
<p>該日人乃咆哮謂阿氏侮辱日本陸軍、竟向阿氏頭部左側猛擊一下、致阿氏所御眼鏡墜下、而後攫其左手、扭至背後、强迫阿氏下跪、兩日人操日語交談後、勒令阿氏出示其「所發抨擊三浦將軍之電文、阿氏謂渠果發此電、可檢閱電稿爲證、兩日人乃再度肆意搜查、卽臥室中箱篋亦所不免、</p>
<p>挾取原稿揚長而去</p>
<p>當獲短稿九篇之原稿、終乃連同關於華德將軍一書之正副原稿、携之返客堂、警吿阿氏謂句在十分鐘內鳴警、則將開槍擊之、言畢揚長而去、阿氏未聞電梯上駛、大約兩日人係循扶梯而下、</p>
<p>移時報警蹤跡杳然</p>
<p>移時阿氏嗚警、全厦皆知、但未捕獲行兇者、緣該厦有出入口六處、日人住戶頗衆、兩日人或係分別出厦、或避身該厦日人寓室、其蒙面之手帕兩方、則棄於扶梯上、</p>
<p>九月心血將付東流</p>
<p>據阿氏稱、渠與紐約杜蘭公司訂立合同、而著作關於華德將軍一書、已預支稿費美金五百元、交稿時復可得五百元、合同紙仍藏阿氏保險箱中、被刦之稿、共三五四頁、約十萬零六千字、著作迄今、已歷九月、苟未能歸還、則九月心血、盡赴東流、或須付還預支之五百元、</p>
<p>短稿九篇價值難估</p>
<p>而渠著是書、耗於參考舊書及照相等、已逾法幣八百元、至於被刦短稿九篇之價値、則更難決定、據渠之紐約代理處報吿、好萊塢影業公司亟欲購買關於華德將軍一書之攝製電影權、</p>
<h3>法商電車工潮解決　工人今晨復工　昨晚有百餘人入廠工作　法租界鐵門今可全開放</h3>
<p>連綿已達五日之法商電車公司七百銅匠工人之念工工潮、至昨晨已透露有解決希望之曙光、公司當局、自始卽與工人保持接觸、以覔致解決辦法、昨日上午、工人代表又與公司當局舉行談判、雙方意見、已趨接近、卽將訂立協定、昨日午後、復經法總領事任調停、一切問題、遂得迎刃而解、工人代表、認爲滿意、旋於晚間七時半、有一部份工人百餘名、已進廠復工、至全體機務處七百餘人、可望於今晨六時許一律進廠工作、相持數日怠工之風潮、至此吿一結束、事後探悉、捕房方面派置鐵甲車兩輛於公司門前、已經撤回捕房、僅留巡捕數名、在公司四週戒備、</p>
<p>求新工潮尚未解決</p>
<p>南市滬軍營機廠街法商求新機器造船廠全體工人、於十八日因表示援助法商水電工友迅達要求目的起見、一致響應加入罷工、並以該廠工資較同業任何廠家爲低、故亦要求增加米貼、至二十日止、尙未解決、廠方以曾於六月四日起、按月增加工資四成及每人米貼十八元、今復罷工、似難接受、已於十九日貼出通吿、著各工人卽速復工、否則至七月底將各人工資交由工廠轉發結束、</p>
<p>水廠工作並未中輟</p>
<p>南市滬軍營機廠街法商自來水公司、一部份機器間、專事吸取黃浦水源灌至蘆家灣總廠、供給法租界全區用戶、自來水電工人罷工後、該機器間工作由法籍工程師兩人担任、但於昨日起、臨時添僱白俄多名加入工作、藉維重要之用水料供給、</p>
<p>兩處鐵門昨午開放</p>
<p>由於法商電車公司勞資雙方意見巳趨接近、使此項工潮之嚴重性、遂漸减少、故昨日法租界各處之戒備、已形鬆弛、新開河南陽橋兩處鐵門、亦於昨日中午、重行開放、其他鐵門、則仍關閉如故、但聞有於今日全部開放說、</p>
<h3>芝巴德輪今日出口</h3>
<p>據航業界確息、楂華公司郵船芝巴穗號、行駛南洋爪哇及香港等地、於前日抵滬後、原定於昨日出口、茲因該船裝卸貨之碼頭小工罷工關係、以致延期出口、該郵船現決定改期於今日出口、</p>

<p>兩岸要塞先後克服　大浹江北岸招　山威遠砲台、一度陷於日手、據昨晚滬方得報、業巳克服、惟南岸金　山宏遠砲台、則尚未收復、惟要塞重要據點如老虎山·師姑嶺·青　嶺、等、均經華軍克復、戰事已形好轉、老虎山一帶登陸日海軍陸戰隊、經華軍趕到力堵、已將其逐出、小港正面及左右兩翼戰事、正在繼續進行中、惟小港經數度爭奪、全鎮已成廢墟、日軍　退、縱火焚燒、情形淒慘、鎮海城區情形混亂、並有大火、</p>

<p>郵電　送稍感困惑　上海與　波間之電訊、現已傳遠消息、據向外灘十八號之美國通訊社探詢、該社收發上海與　波間之電報、現仍暢通、惟由上海發至　波者、或因該處收報人地址遷移、不負送到之責、惟由　波發至上海者、迄今至昨晚、仍極暢通、據海關方面消息、　波海關自鎮海砲戰起後、至今未接到來電、至所有寄往浙東各地包括鄭縣·永嘉·浙　路及皖南各地郵件、郵局於每日下午一時三十分封發、交由每日下午一時三時二十分開行之滬杭車前往杭州、經吳興轉　、寄往福建·江西·湖南（該兩省之淪陷區除外）及廣東省經綫一一五度以東、及粵漢路連江口浛光以北各地者、發由廈門轉經海滄轉　·寄往廣西·柳州·桂林·宜山等地者、發由香港轉經廣州　　遂溪轉　寄往湖北省及鄂省以東（淪陷區除外）者、發由海防昆明轉　、又以運輸困難、所有寄往鄭縣本口·永嘉本口·及福建省各地之重件、除厦門外、郵局昨亦停止收寄、</p>
<h3>咖啡館糾紛案　美國拒不批評　但主張在滬就地解決　美領將抗議交貝克</h3>
<p>美國合　社華盛頓二十日電、美國國務院、昨日拒不批評星期五日在滬日軍所提懲罰本星期初美國海軍陸戰隊與日本平民數人在太平洋咖啡館[酗酒爭吵]肇事者之要求、但國務院官員堅絕表示、國務院迄今主張該案須在滬就地就絕、仍極暢通、</p>

<h3>嚴重的社會問題　江俊孫節育所特訊</h3>
<p>自軍興以還，本市　成特殊區域，雖市面繁榮，其程度視戰前或尤加甚，要皆為畸形的現象，與正常之發展不同，是故表面縱使熙熙攘攘，不改當年，而市民生活之實際情况，殆靡勿有其竭獗不勝之痛苦，近數月來，國際風雲，波　雲詭。滬上一般情勢，更感動盪不寧，而月　薪津生活之家庭，處此環境，其所受威脅，愈興嚴重，幸而子女單淸，尙能勉力撐持，舍竟生育頻繁，食口眾多，則難乎其為父母矣。</p>
<p>吾人常見困於子女累者，終日奔走衣食猶尙不足　其最低之生活，自無餘力再為其子女謀敎育，子女旣無良好培養，其將來之收穫亦復可知，若不加以補救，關　民族前途殊鉅。留德醫學博士江俊孫衣食，在滬行醫垂二十在，鑒于上述問題之重要，特創設一節育所於成都路四八三農弄十二號，（電話三六六八八）藉為調整生育盡其最善治努力，江醫師學術精湛，一具葛氏科學原理，實施避孕療法，旣無痛苦，又能隨時恢復其受孕機能，而于月經性慾絕無影響，誠為近代最科學化經濟化之避孕方法，造福於中產以下階級實匪淺　，蓋此不獨家庭中彈可以减輕，即其巳育之子女，亦能得有相當敎育與訓導，造成未來幸福之基礎，至於母體方面，則避免多產之虧耗，常葆健康之愉快，為益尤難盡述</p>

<h3>右圖上係羅斯福總統下係副總統候選人華萊斯（現任農務部長）</h3>
<h3>美總統三任問題</h3>
<p>「這次的戰爭並非一種尋常的戰爭，而是一種武力革命，各地各人都受其威脅。這種革命並不欲解放人類，而欲使之降爲奴隸。……我的良心對於人民的呼聲，不能置之不顧。………美國人民如用自由擇舉的方式，向予呼喚，我可極簡單的聲明，我得上帝的援助，自當盡我能力所及，賡續供職。」這是羅斯福總統對民主黨全國代表大會推舉他爲總統候選人之後的重要表示。</p>
<p>美國總統的第三任問題，爭論已久。夷考美國史乘，開國元勳華盛頓，並不如一般人所想像的反對總統長期任職。他的繼人卽民主黨創立人傑孚遜則曾堅決反對第三任總統，因將華盛頓拒絕第三任總統的舉動，造成爲一種慣例。華盛頓在制憲大會時且曾暗中反對美國憲法列入限制總統連任决數一條。當時傑孚遜正在法國，曾主張美國總統應以一任爲限。其他代表有主張三年一選，對於連任不加限制者，亦有主張總統任期定爲七年，不得連任者。最後憲法規定總統任期四年，一切限制連任的建議均遭否決。</p>
<p>據另一種意見，華盛頓卽對於第一任總統，亦無意擔任，不過爲欲使新政府上軌道起見，乃勉爲其難，對於第二任更非衷心所願，嗣由於當時國際形勢，乃不得不蟬聯。在其多事的第二任終了時，他厭倦已極，深願返歸凡爾蒙故鄉，度其恬靜生活。</p>
<p>傑孚遜的反對二任總統，較之華盛頓的不願三任，還要露骨。他曾在一七八七年致書麥迪生，痛陳憲法起草委員會未規定總統連任决數之失。在他第二任總統期內，八個州議會曾擁護他競選第三任總統。他卽在私函中加以拒絕，並聲明總統連任期限不得超過八年。他並致書北加羅萊那州議會說：『我不願爲始作俑者，去不顧光榮的先進所樹立的善例，蟬聯二任以上的總統。』但他退任後，對於繼任總統麥迪生與門羅的選舉，仍在幕後居於有力地位。</p>
<p>自此而後，三任問題卽未成爲嚴重問題。共間某某總統且曾以辛勞過度，未滿第一任，卽遽爾謝世。而主張修正憲法，限制鰓統連任次數者，亦有多起。傑克遜曾主張總統任期應以六年爲一任，不得連任。但各種修正案均未成立。直至建國百年後格蘭脫時代，始乃舊事重提，不過如曇花一現而已。</p>
<p>迄至齊奧多羅斯幅時代，第三任總統問題又起。麥金雷被刺後，齊奧多羅斯福承乏故總統未滿的任期，旋又連任一次，却不願再爲第三任的候選人。不過四年之後，他因爲不滿其繼任者塔虎脫的政策，又向共和黨大會要求推舉他爲候選人，他說：『他從前反對第三任，乃指蟬聯三任而言。』他這種要求失敗後，就組織進步共和黨出而競選。當時三角總統競選運動極爲尖銳，結果徒使共和黨分裂，而使民主黨的候選人威爾遜當選。他却獲得四，一二六，〇二〇票，塔虎脫僅得三，四八三，九二二票。威爾遜得六，二八六，二一四票，較共和黨合起來的票數少一百餘萬票。</p>
<p>哈定死於第一任內，柯立芝繼任，完滿其第一任任期，第二任又在一九二四年當選。柯立芝第二任當選後，第三任問題又發生了。但他在一九一七年八月二日，卽聲明不願在一九二八年再爲總統候選人。其眞意何在，後來亦經揣測好幾個月。大多數人則承認他無意再作馮婦，係屬眞情。迨一九二八年，參議院曾以五十六對二十六票的多數，通過拉福勒議案，稱第三任總統爲『不賢明，不愛國，充滿危險性的舉動。』</p>
<p>至於當前羅斯福總統的三任問題，在一九三七年他宣誓連任之後，美國政界卽已開始討論他滿任後將如何。以如此有作有爲的人物退休林泉，僅僅以『海德公園地方紳士』終其天年，實屬難以想像。久而久之，第三任問題就有人提及，幾而歐戰劇變，這種美國史上微妙的問題竟漸形成民意的結晶。</p>
<p>不過羅斯福總統本人年來對於這個問題，始終保守緘默，直至本月十八日夜間十一時十八分始由參議員巴克萊在芝加哥民主黨全國代表大會代他宣讀一百四十六個字的聲明，其主旨謂：『總統迄無蟬聯，或由本屆大會推舉爲候選入之意，過去如此，今日亦然。切望本屆大會各代表自由推舉任何候選人。』這種正大光明的態度，就是說民意如用自由選舉的方式，一致擁護，他爲國爲世界，自然義不容辭。</p>
<p>大會得着這個消息，便如觸電似的以極大多數推定他爲候選人，以敵共和黨的候選人威爾基。羅斯福總統旋由無綫電直接向大會表示接受。這個歷史上的問題於是吿一段落，並且可以預料，美國人民在十一月間舉行大選時，羅斯福什九可以當選連任。</p>
<h3>李本特洛甫與莫洛托夫（下）</h3>
<p>— 恩</p>
<p>德國外交部長李本特洛甫到處帶有英國人氣味。他可說第一個英國式的德國外交家。卽在體質方面—軀體高昂，金髮碧眼，面部坦白，健美而服裝勻貼—他很可充得伊頓學校出身的不列顚政治家。講話時，疾徐中節，很少不必要的手勢，他具有倫敦唐寗街十號最優越政治家顚撲不破和雍容謙遜的風度。</p>
<p>有些人形容李本特洛甫爲十足的德國旅行推銷員，這不過一部份正確而已。他具有一種本領，能混入任何社會，英國好，法國也好，甚至俄國更好。他能很流利地說他們的話，而且毫不吃力而自然的去摹擬各種口吻，以適應當時的需要。至於他胸中「噱頭」之多，談吐之妙，卽使縉紳華貴之流，也儘能引之爲同調。但是造成這樣一個「括括叫」推銷員的各種才能，德國倒是沒有份的。要是仔細的說，李本特洛甫却由各國不同的風度拚湊而成，他是一個英國式的外交家，又攙混了短小精悍的，巴黎旅館主人的一種榦練便給的高才</p>
<p>李本特洛甫以一八九三年生於穗國一個小鎭，他變親是中產階級中人。他之獲得貴族頭銜者，係由於他一個任顯職於陸軍中的伯父立嗣而來。他早年敎育並沒有按步就班。童年時會就學於瑞十學校，法國私塾，和英國大學。實際上，他從來沒有在中學或大學畢業，而且他在學校讀書也頗馬虎。但是他通達事務，悟心甚靈。他的外貌和應付之才，令人一見之下，就曉得他是一個幹才。他精通的課程祗有地理一種。對於歷史的觀念，不過知其輪廓而已。就另一方面說，他對於經商却是斵輪老手。</p>
<p>將近二十歲的時候，他曾在坎拿大居住過三年，這對於他的性格上影響甚大。他在那裏的一家建築公司中，擔任工頭一流的職務，就在這期間中，他學得了如何對待下屬的方法。他天性帶有浪漫或冒險家的成份。當一九一四年他獲得世界大戰的消息時，他便坐立不安終於想盡了各種化裝方法，加以他精通各國語言，得機遄回德國。但其實際參戰的日子，爲時極短。他因爲熟諳美洲情形，被派入參謀部仟職。旋卽調任至德國駐美大使館，從德國搭了潛水艇赴紐約轉往華盛頓任所。他的頂頭上司，是朋士托夫大使的軍事參贊佛朗士巴本。消息靈通者說，巴本在美國和坎拿大煽動工潮，慕後都出自李本特洛甫的策劃。無論如何，在美國尙未參戰之前，有許多間諜工作都是由他所做，或自己指揮，這是無可置疑的。巴本對李本特洛甫的協助，認爲非常滿意，甚至當他被調任土耳其大使的時候，曾叫「阿李」幫忙。</p>
<p>上次歐戰吿終，李本特洛甫的間諜工作也吿結束。在民治主義的德國政府中他沒有揷足的餘地。嗣後幾年中，他做些工作，補助個人的經濟。他充當一家著名法國香賓酒公司的推銷員，因爲成續優越，德國最大香賓酒廠主亨格爾，不但叫他擔負推銷主任之職，而且還叫他做了乘龍快婿呢。</p>
<p>李本特洛甫成爲富有而成功的商人之後，又想棄商從政，參加政治密謀，把結上了希特勒。那時候的希特勒，在德國的政治棋盤中，雖不是黑得完全看不見，究竟還是一匹黯然無光的馬。但是這位亨格爾百萬遺產的承繼者，這時候並不參加國社黨的活動。他不過設法與德國的未來元首接近，他以經濟資助國社黨，並和黨中的中堅份子來往甚密。</p>
<p>一九三二年一月政變時，拉攏已本與希特勒者，便是李本特洛甫。他並爲希特勒拜受興登堡總統之命組閣的前驅。他曾在巴本面前漏過消息說，一旦希特勒握得政權，外交部長之職，勢非借重巴本不可。希特勒執政後數月，李本特洛甫被任爲軍縮委員會委員，未幾又任國社黨外交股長，這位前任香賓酒推銷員者就完全掌握了國社黨的外交政策，並不把當時名義上還是德國外交部長牛蘭特放在眼裏。他所答應於巴本的話，竟是「隨風而去」了。</p>
<p>李本時洛甫爲希特勒對英政策之計劃者，這是現在大家所公認的。當他在一九三六年充仟駐英大使期中，與英國政界樞要，十分交好。他對英外交第一大功，綮啟於一九三八年的春季。那時他正是以煊赫一時的德國外長資格訪問倫敦，曾絆住了哈里法克斯動爵兩天，致使奧國駐英大使沒有方法和英外長接觸。就在這時間中，德國的軍隊已開進奧國領土了。李本特洛甫却一再與哈里法克斯檢討德國的外交。當這烟幕消散，哈里法克斯神志淸醒的時候，希特勒已成爲奧國的主人了。</p>
<p>四年前三月，倫敦一個雨天下午，國聯理事會正在判斷德軍重佔萊茵流域問題，李本特洛甫代表希特勒在席上訴說一番時，蘇俄外交委員長李維諾夫，公然側身避開，口中念念有詞的讀起報紙來。李本特洛甫受此難堪，未免漲紅了臉，但是他朝着這個共黨的反對份子，不屑地看上一眼後，又繼續着演說了。　李本特洛甫把這件事，牢記在心。去夏，當他飛往莫斯科簽訂蘇俄協定時，他帶笑向莫洛托夫問候蘇俄卸任外交委員長李維諾夫的起居，並且很有意義的譽，他們倆，李本特洛甫和莫洛托夫，「現在」互求諒解，當然不致有何困難了。</p>
<p>莫洛托夫與李本特洛甫兩人頗能互相了解。莫洛托夫會經對史太林說，共產黨與世界上同情者，對於蘇聯與中歐主人國社黨訂立協定，一定能贊同。李本特洛甫也會向希特勒擔保，德穌協定能使英國不干涉德國進兵波蘭。這兩位外交家一定感覺到，在通常獨裁制的情况下，雙方如有失算，雙方就有破產之虞。</p>
<p>大力士式的蘇俄外交委員長和漂亮的德國國社黨外交政策推銷員，顯然都不怕他們的東家。莫洛托夫的辦公室和史太林的相昆連，但是各報訪員都說，史太林常常親自到他莫洛托夫的屋子裏去。另一方面，德國外交部長，是希特勒昨一「商量」外交事件的人。戈林將軍對於這位「國社黨中的野人」的勢力澎漲，常常表示憤懣。我們且不必推測史太林和希特勒兩人，究竟誰是誰的俾儡。還是來問問他們兩人是否已成爲莫洛托夫與李本特洛宙的「玩意兒」，倒來得親切有味哩。</p>

<p>捕蝗古法（二）</p>
<p>按蝗為蟊賊之屬，爾雅釋詩，有食苗心，食葉，食節，食根之別，今則民間無暇分別之，皆謂之蝗。古人風俗純厚，雅詩所言，似皆民自除之，故於報賽田租之日，禱祀以求，不聞有司之為民除害也。春秋書災異，言螟者有之，而傳亦未詳捕除之法。後世徹法不行，賦徵於畝，小有災歉，官不以聞，仍照常徵收，故農田一有患害，民惟恐有司之不知，卽行紛紛入告，如天旱久雨，河決雹傷，無一不具荒呈，於是民間所應自除之患，遂為官之責任所不敢辭，故禁屠設壇，勘水道，固隄防，終歲勞勞，不　休息；其最為焦思而難於挽回者，則莫如蝗。竊意古人行事，類能握要以圖，詳繹其意，知古者捕蝗之法，舍火焚而別無他術也。開元初年，山東旱蝗，姚元崇請分遣使捕蝗曰：『臣聞大田詩曰「秉畀炎火」者，捕蝗之術也，古人行之于前，陛下用之於後。古人行之，所以安農；陛下用之，所以除害。』可見火攻一策，歷代奉以為捕蝗要法。</p>

<p>2，心中感覺——『覺得孔心』，這不是得救，乃是對自己和罪惡有了初步的認識！不過這經歷也是可貴的，因為他巳開始受神的光照，朋友！你曾有這種經騐麼？</p>
<p>3，詢問門徑——『弟兄們！我們當怎樣行？』遊覽不安，自然會發這樣的問題，朋友！你對這問題需要解答麼？</p>
<p>4，得蒙指引——『你們各認要悔改，奉耶穌基督的名受浸，叫你們的罪得赦，就必須受所應許配的聖靈。』</p>
<p>5，內心接受——『領受到他話』，聖靈是一步一步的領帶人好像上山一樣，內心接受，是上到了山頂，你若眞心領受，就會得着神在約翰福音三章十六節的應許。</p>

<h3>怎樣用經濟的方法練習圖畫？</h3>
<p>— 亮寰</p>
<p>在這非常時期，百物飛漲，紙張，顏料，畫具，都比戰前貴起幾倍，我們要練習圖畫，似乎不大容易。有許多家長，也許會因經濟關係而阻止小朋友門練習圖畫，這是很可惜的。其實小朋友們如果有志於此，也儘可想出種種經濟而又能獲得美滿效果的方法從事練習，現在我可貢獻幾種方法，俱小朋友們參考：</p>
<p>甲經濟的畫具</p>
<p>一、紙：常用的鉛筆畫紙，都是舶來品，而且價額很高，我們可以用本國的礬連史紙代替；這種紙每大帳約費三角，足够也不能買，那麼可利用已　用過的鉛筆紙，反面淸潔的，反面還可作畫：不清潔的，可用濃墨把全體塗黑，待乾，壓平，再用白粉作畫。如果沒有鉛畫紙可以利用，那麼搜集些包裹用的牛皮紙，用水浸濕，壓平，或貼在玻璃上，等乾，也可以做畫紙。</p>
<p>二、顏色：這是較難解決的問題。本國出品較廉的，如馬利工廠六色小匣，每匣也要六七角；單管的每管約二角餘。西洋貨要比平時貴起十幾倍，可以不必用牠。如果連本國貨也無力購備，就約幾個同學合買一份輪流使用，也很便利。否則藍·紅墨水，也可以利用一下；若是都難辦到，專用鉛筆或墨筆作畫，也能畫出很好的作品來。——我國盛行的水墨畫和西洋的素描畫，就是不用顏色的畫。</p>
<p>三、白粉：這是利用黑色或暗色紙作畫時用的。除鉛粉外，塗鞋用的白粉或面粉牙粉外等，加些膠水調和，就可應用。和少許淡色，畫再暗色紙上，最為顯明美觀。</p>
<p>四、畫筆：鉛筆，精製的軟鉛，價格也很高，就用平時鈔寫筆記用的較軟得鉛筆也不妨。毛筆，用舊的中楷寫字筆，洗净了，就可應用。石筆和粉筆，可在石板或黑板上練習作畫，比較最為經濟。</p>
<p>五、橡皮：以不用為是，如必須用牠，可用麵包塊代替。</p>
<p>乙、經濟的畫法</p>
<p>一、習作：不論學習什麽東西，要進步總該常常主義練習，圖畫當然不能例外。習畫的方法，以實物寫生為最有價値，專事臨摹是沒有什麽效果的。（但學習圖畫，不妨從臨摹入手）寫生的對象以靜物為主，如文具，家具，瓜果，菜蔬，花卉……等，都可作為寫生的材料。其他如睡着的貓狗，和小弟弟，小妹妹等也可用　寫法生。只要你肯注意練習，不論用什麽畫具，不論在室內室外，每天至少練習一刻鐘，一個暑假以後，必定有相當的進步。</p>
<p>二、成績品：除習作以外，倘使你要畫幾張假期作業成績品，預備交到學校裏去，那麼你也可以利用現成的紙張，（不拘大小）用平塗法（墨墨或白粉都可），或鉛筆，墨筆，或加些淡彩，畫成成績品，到開學以前，挑選最好的幾張，貼在適當的　紙上，增加作品的美觀，就成為優良的成績品了。</p>
<h3>蟲與彈（下）</h3>
<p>— 蘇明</p>
<p>那時在歐洲第一次大戰，法國有一位飛行家曾在報紙上發表一段驚奇的新聞，他說當他駕着飛機，在二千米的高空偵察着地形的时候，那時飛機的速度也很快，忽然看見有一個小東西向他面上擈飛過來，他以為這是個小蟲罷了，於是用手把它抓住，拿來一看，却使這位飛行家驚駭得社麼的，你道是誰？他確抓到了敵方的一個小砲彈。這不是一件見所非見聞所未聞的笑話？實際上，細細地一想，一點也沒有希奇，而是件平常的事。因為砲彈前進的速度，不能保持它剛出砲口時得速度，山於空氣的抵抗力，使它飛行的速度，漸漸地降低，到後來幾乎和飛機飛行的速度相同，於是飛行家會看到在空中砲彈不動的現象，或像一隻小蟲微微地飛動，他自然毫不費力的把它抓住了。砲彈在這種條件下可以　不傷人。可是種相反情况之下，蘋菓也會像砲彈般的打傷人！有一天，有一部汽車像飛一般的在公路上開着，公路旁的農民，把蘋菓，西瓜，等拋給在他們身邊飛過的汽車中表示歡迎。那知這些禮　，却被汽車上的人目為砲彈般得可怕，蘋果使他們遭受到了嚴重的創傷，西瓜敲碎了氣缸，更打碎了玻璃這是什麽！理由是很容易明白的，汽車的速度本是很快的，再加上了西瓜和蘋果的拋擲過來的速度就變成了危險的，有破壞力量的槍彈，譬如每一小時駛行一百二十萬米的汽車，把四十萬克重的西瓜的砲彈具有同樣的動力，這當然要發生可怖的結果。這件確是實事，發生在一九二四年俄國舉行汽車疾駛比賽的時候。」</p>
<h3>秀蘭鄧波兒自傳（十）（一）</h3>
<p>在牀邊做過夜禱以後，就上牀睡下，媽媽立刻把電燈熄了。我獨個兒在暗室之中，頭雖着在枕上，一時還不能入睡，就把那説白重又背誦了幾遍，到得第二天早上醒回來時，那就熟極而流了。</p>
<p>可甘，我上學校去時，心中是不斷的牢記着那些說白，生恐忘卻。然而不但是牢記說白罷了；我還需要媽媽指點我怎樣表演一切動作。你要知道媽媽實在也是一位很好的導演，我所主言的影片中，媽媽總得先費一番工夫指導我，因此上了攝影塲，使導演們省力不少。尤其難得的，每當我在攝影塲上工作時，媽媽從不參與，只是旁觀。可是異同到平屋中，一回到家裏，伊就開始活動起來，不憚煩的對我指導一切。因此福克斯公司付伊一份很大的薪水，承認伊是我的私人導演。我層聽得爸爸對他的朋友們說，靠着他任銀行中所得的薪水，和媽媽子啊影片公司中所得的薪水，儘夥買一所新屋子，使傑克和生南受高等敎育，並能好好的撫養我。爸爸幷且說，凡是我掙來的錢，並不動用，完全存在他的銀行裏等我長大起來。</p>
<p>大明星威爾羅吉士先生常喚媽媽是我的經理先生。有一天我和媽媽子在攝影塲的餐堂中庸餐，羅吉士先生跑到我們的桌子旁來，他老人家是喜歡說笑話的，指着我所吃的一盤菜蔬，不住的搖頭道：「哼！你怎麼吃這兔子吃的東西，而你的經理先生卻自管吃着牛排，這是那裏說起！」當時我就對他說，這並不是兔子吃的東西，我本來愛吃一切菜蔬的，我所不喜歡的，就只洋蔥罷了。</p>

<h3>有天父沒有？　（一）</h3>
<p>今日有許多人說沒有上帝。他們說這樣的話，乃是因為世界上充滿了不義和不平。另有許多人，雖說有上帝，但他們說這位上帝，不是一位善良的上帝，並不關心人類的幸福。基督徒不但相信有上帝，也相信上帝是善良的，是全人類的天父。</p>
<p>現在讓我們來研究上面的三種說法，看他們所說的是否眞實？論到上帝的品質，如果我們說他不是善良的，這樣那就等於說他不是上帝。因為上帝的存在，與上帝的品質，是有聯帶的關係，存則俱存，亡則俱亡。</p>
<p>上帝的善良，並不是一個新的問題，乃是從世界有史以來，早已表現於人類之前的。但人們為甚麼想到這問題？同時也喜歡討論這問題呢？這就是因為人們重視道德和善良，珍視它們在一切之上的緣故。請問人們這種重視道德和善良的觀念，是從那裏來的呢？我們相信人是上帝造的，人們這種重視道德和善良的觀念，是從萬善之源的上帝那裏來的。人們這種渴求善德的願望，是從上帝來的，那就證明上帝本身是善良的。</p>
<p>雖然如此，人世間却有許多事使人疑惑上帝的公義和善德，同時也使許多基督徒，對於上帝是否是人類的天父，在信仰上，起了動搖。為便於討論起見，且提出三方面的困難：（一）物質世界的困難。（二）動物世界的困難。（三）人類世界的困難。</p>
<p>（一）物質世界的困難：這些困難的問題，是起於人類和動物所親受的痛苦。這些痛苦，都是由於人類不能控制的天災—大風，水，火，地震，山崩等等—所致的，於是人和動物就只成為無助的犧牲者。例如：我國一九三二年的火水災，日本一九二三年的大地震，就不知犧牲了多少人的性命。在這些災難發生的時候，人就會想到天地之間是否有一位善良的上帝，關心他的被造之物？我們在提出這樣問題的時候，首當記得我們這個世界，是根據某種法則而存在的。如果這種法則停止了，我們就不能生活。使雨從雲裏降落，風吹，以及火從地上燒起來的那些力，都是依從這種法則進行，使世界達到利於人和動物生存繁榮的環境。有時這些力的活動，就致成暴風，洪水或地震的天災，犧牲不少性命。　（待二十三日再續）</p>

<h3>梅蘭芳已赴馬尼拉</h3>
<p>— 慧存</p>
<p>胡蝶亦作赴菲凖備</p>
<p>梅蘭芳於戰後離滬，在港度寓公生活，迄將三年，平日除與當地友好交際應酬外，暇時卽繪畫飼鳥自娛，生活頗為優閒，而對於粉墨生涯表示厭倦，故已蓄鬚不擬再現色相於紅氍毺上矣。</p>
<p>近因港島局勢緊張，當局復積極疏散人口，各影片公司粉作他遷之圖，梅氏亦無意再留港島，前曾一度傳說梅氏將膺聘赴昆明，迄未成為事實，茲據筆者接得港地來訊，梅氏已於本月五日與隨從人等搭輪離港赴馬尼拉，梅氏是否將在該地久住，尙未可知。又影星胡蝶亦作離港準備，據聞其目的地，亦為馬尼拉，然何日成行，須俟船票購得方可決定　　時潘有聲亦有偕行之說。</p>
<h3>朱冰心秘密到滬</h3>
<p>— 太公</p>
<p>「王先生」湯傑前年二度入川，流浪了一年多，方重回上海，繼續攝「王先生」影片，到現在已公映了四部，「描金鳳」則是古裝的「王先生」影片。</p>
<p>不久前，本刋載有一段消息，是說湯傑與朱冰心，有重溫舊好的可能，關於這，昨由記者獨得了一個秘訊，就是朱冰心於日前已從香港秘密到上海來了。按湯傑和朱冰心的結合，是在四年前新時代公司宣吿停辦「王先生」銀幕生活無法繼續下去的時候，剛有人發起組織「明星劇團」，集合歌舞，平劇，話劇等，開往南洋各地表演，湯傑亦是其中台柱之一，而朱冰心，則係歌舞班中一員新角，當他們未離滬前，朱冰心以醉心銀幕生活，便早樂於和他接近，為時不久，二人就實行了同居，曾養過一男一女。</p>
<p>去年的七月間，湯傑以處境不佳，對於兩個門戶不免捉襟見肘，結果，就由韓蘭根介紹一位律師，給他們脫離夫妾關係，這次朱冰心秘密來滬，當然雙方都很滿意，在湯傑，以近為新華工作碌，酬勞較豐，所以也不怕再發生經濟上的恐慌了。</p>
<p>現在，聞朱冰心暫時住在友人家候湯傑籌得妥當辦法後，再行舊店新開，惟以後之朱冰心，是否獻身銀幕，或為其他工作，一時也未定當，月隔一個時期，也許大家可以知道的吧。</p>

<p>霍桑噴出了一口烟，旋轉頭來向我和倪金壽瞅了一眼。倪金壽點點頭，似表示他已領會霍桑的暗示。我也體味到王麗蘭對老毛所說的「沒有事」，恰巧是「有事」的注脚，伊分明故意要把老毛差開去。</p>
<p>霍桑又向老毛問道：「好，你說下去。昨夜你什麼時候從戲院裏回來？」。</p>
<p>老毛道：「我回來得很早，十二點光景就到這裏——」</p>
<p>霍桑揷口道：「什麼？戲院裏散得這樣早？」</p>
<p>「不是，昨夜裏很悶熱，戲院裏的人又擠得滿滿的。我坐了不到兩個鐘頭，我的頭便覺得發昏，後來越看越昏，像是發痧。到了十一點半光景，我再也熬不住，所以等不到完戲，就跑出來。」</p>
<p>霍桑點點頭。「以後怎樣？」</p>
<p>老毛道：「我回來以後，呑了一些萬金油，喝了一杯冷茶，頭昏就好得多——」</p>
<p>「且慢。你進門的時候，這屋子裏的情形怎樣？」</p>
<p>老毛一聽這句，談話的興致似乎又提高了。他低專聲說：「我要吿訴你們的奇怪情形，就是這個：我是從大同路那面轉過來的。在大同路相近轉角的地方，停着一輛黑色汽車，汽車中却沒有人。當時我也不在意，所以不曾留心汽車的號碼進大門的時候，我瞧見樓上二層窗上都已沒有燈光，祗有這會客室裏的燈光依舊亮着。那時雨下得很大。我進大門時，門虛掩着沒有鎖。我走進來以後，照樣輕輕把門合上，就進我自己的門房裏去。」</p>
<p>「你沒有把大門下鎖嗎？」</p>
<p>老毛搖搖頭，「沒有。」</p>

<h3>The Chinese Army Splits and Counterattacks Zhenhai, Recapturing Mountain Strongholds in the Suburbs of Zhenhai. A Major Fire Erupts Within Zhenhai City as the Chinese Army Besieges it. A Portion of the Japanese Army Lands in Southern Zhenhai but is Repelled.</h3>
<p>A Certain Location in Eastern Zhejiang: The war situation in the coastal area of Zhenhai has taken a sharp turn. The Chinese army, dividing its forces to implement a resolute counterattack, advances bravely and irresistibly. Consequently, the strongholds of Laoshu Mountain, Xiaogang, Sigushan, Jiangnanshi, Yaqian, and others have all been successively captured by the Chinese army. The two forts of Zhenyuan and Hongyuan in Zhenhai are also under intense siege by the Chinese army. On the afternoon of the 19th, at 4 p.m., the Zhendai Fort was captured, annihilating a large number of Japanese troops. The remaining Japanese forces in Hongyuan Fort will soon be completely eliminated by the Chinese army. Furthermore, the Chinese army is encircling and attacking Zhenhai City, inflicting heavy casualties on the Japanese troops. A major fire has now broken out within Zhenhai City, with flames reaching the sky. The Chinese army is intensifying its attack. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>A Certain Location in Eastern Zhejiang: After the Chinese army captured the two strongholds of Sigushan and Xiaogang, on the afternoon of the 18th, the Japanese army regrouped reinforcements to counterattack the Chinese army, engaging in fierce back-and-forth fighting in Xiaogang Town. The Chinese army killed many Japanese soldiers. Fierce battles are still ongoing in the vicinity of Xiaogang Town. Separately, a portion of the Japanese army landed in southern Zhenhai to invade, while naval artillery provided intense bombardment to cover their operations. The Chinese army calmly met the attack and repelled the Japanese forces. (18th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: According to recent war dispatches from the Chinese side, Japanese naval landing forces are currently concentrated in three or four ports in southeastern China, such as Quanzhou Port northeast of Xiamen in Fujian Province, Xiangshan Port in Zhejiang Province, and the southern bank of Hangzhou, engaging in landings. The Japanese army landing on the southern bank of Hangzhou Bay has already occupied Zhenhai, the gateway to Ningbo. In the past two days, the Japanese army has also urgently undertaken landing operations in Xiangshan Port and Quanzhou Port. When the Japanese army attempts to land, they are assisted by Japanese aircraft, while in the Quanzhou Port area, Japanese naval artillery heavily bombards the land to cover the Japanese army's landing. The Japanese navy participating in the operation includes one aircraft carrier, one cruiser, one destroyer, and eight other warships. (20th United Press Dispatch)</p>
<h3>No Trace of Japanese Troops Within Chongwu, Fujian</h3>
<p>Fuzhou: On the morning of the 16th, Japanese troops forcibly landed at Daqu in Chongwu, Fujian, under the cover of aircraft, attempting to invade Chongwu. After a brave and fierce counterattack by the Chinese army, fighting continued until 5 a.m. on the 17th, completely repelling the landing Japanese forces. Currently, there is no trace of Japanese troops within Chongwu. In this battle, the Chinese army killed a large number of Japanese soldiers. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Anti-War Revolutionary Alliance of Japanese Holds Founding Meeting</h3>
<p>Chongqing: The Anti-War Revolutionary Alliance of Japanese People in China held its founding meeting at 4 p.m. on the 20th, simultaneously conducting a ceremony for the release of prisoners of war. The atmosphere at the meeting was very enthusiastic. The prisoners of war expressed their willingness to participate in China's war of resistance, in order to promote the liberation of the Japanese nation. (20th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>French Consul in Tianjin and Wife Encounter Danger</h3>
<p>Tianjin: Today, the French Consul in Tianjin, Mr. Colin, his wife, and a coachman were traveling by private car along the Pingjin Highway to Ping. En route, they encountered an attack by bandits, but they were not injured and escaped unharmed, arriving safely at their destination. They had to abandon their car at the time. It was later found on the road, riddled with bullet holes. It is reported that there were about ten bandits involved in the attack. Mr. Colin and the others immediately got out of the car and fled to a place of concealment, and were later rescued by another car and taken to a safe location. The Japanese army is currently searching for traces of the bandits near the scene of the incident. (20th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>National Government Issues Order to Commend Xie Yingbo</h3>
<p>Chongqing: The National Government issued an order on the 20th, stating that Xie Yingbo joined the Tongmenghui in his early years and dedicated himself to the revolution. He served in overseas party affairs and propaganda work, tirelessly advocating and working hard. After the Protection of the Constitution movement, he joined the central government, diligently planning and contributing meritorious service. Recently, it was learned that he passed away due to illness, deeply saddened by the loss of a loyal and dedicated official. He should be commended by a clear order to honor his loyalty. This order, (20th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Embargo on Goods on the Yunnan-Burma Road Commences Yesterday, Most Munitions Had Already Been Moved, Only a Few Remain</h3>
<p>Rangoon: A special gazette of Burma, published today, officially prohibits the transport to China of goods specified in the Anglo-Japanese agreement. According to a dispatch from Shiu, large convoys of Chinese trucks, anticipating the imminent cessation of traffic, are rushing to the Chinese border, hoping to cross into Chinese territory by midnight. Before the ban was announced today, few trucks were seen, but a large amount of goods remained in place, impossible to transport all at once. The Southwest Transportation Company has announced that it will continue to transport goods not covered by the ban as usual. According to the company's manager, "This move was anticipated long ago, so measures were taken to move most munitions. Only a few are left." (20th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>America is Willing to Continue Talks on Abolishing Extraterritoriality</p>
<p>Washington: Acting Secretary of State Welles told reporters yesterday that the United States is willing to continue negotiations on abolishing extraterritoriality in China when China restores peace. Welles said that negotiations on abolishing extraterritoriality in China were in progress but stopped due to the outbreak of war. Under this right, American citizens in China are not governed by Chinese law but only by the laws formulated by the administrative authorities of the concessions. (20th United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Washington: Recently, the Washington "Star" published an article advising the American people to criticize Britain's yielding to Japan's demand to block the Burma Road. The newspaper stated that when Britain is at war with Germany and seeks no worries in the rear, it is unfair for others to criticize Britain's actions that it deems appropriate and to reluctantly comply with Japan's demands. Regardless of the actions taken by Downing Street (British Prime Minister's residence), US Secretary of State Hull clearly declared that the United States will not retreat in the Far East. Hull's attitude is noteworthy because Japan is loudly calling for a more aggressive policy toward the United States. (20th United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: The son of a former Chinese government advisor, Duke University Assistant Professor Lin Bakier, said last night to over a thousand Chinese intellectuals that the closure of the Burma Road, from the American perspective, means that China's open-door policy has truly come to an end. After this road is closed, unless consulting with Japan or taking the extremely long route through the Soviet Union, American goods will no longer be able to enter the vast Chinese market.

<p>General Catroux Issues Farewell Address</p>
<p>Hanoi: French Indochina Governor-General General Catroux issued a farewell address today, stating, "I have been ordered by the government to transfer my duties to the newly appointed Admiral Decoux tomorrow. I bid farewell to my French compatriots and the people of Vietnam. Although I am leaving office, I have a clear conscience. During my tenure, I have strived to fulfill my responsibilities, protecting our nation's land, currency, honor, and flag, and enabling you to live and work in peace. As for foreign affairs, I have not only maintained existing friendly relations but have also enhanced them. Thus, peace has been maintained both internally and externally. I firmly believe that promoting this policy is not only understandable to neighboring countries but also maintains our country's reputation in the Far East." (20th Havas Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Hanoi: Governor-General of Vietnam General Catroux announced today that he has resigned. His successor is former Commander-in-Chief of the French Far East Fleet, Admiral Decoux. General Petain ordered the appointment of Decoux to this position on June 25. (20th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Japanese Newspapers Comment on Churchill's Speech</p>
<p>Hong Kong Tokyo Dispatch: The "Mainichi Shimbun" commented on Churchill's speech, stating that the British Prime Minister indicated that Britain is willing to abolish (extraterritoriality), unequal treaties, return concessions in China, and mediate the Sino-Japanese war. Regardless of Britain's motives, it at least indicates that Britain's Far East policy has undergone a major change. Unfortunately, Britain's expression came too late and was not proposed twelve months ago. It seems that Churchill did not consult with the United States and the Soviet Union on the peace proposal in advance. This move only serves to indicate Britain's difficult situation. The "Asahi Shimbun" believes that under the current circumstances, Britain cannot but close the Burma and Hong Kong routes. After the Anglo-Japanese compromise, it is questionable what policy the Chongqing government will adopt. The "Nichinichi Shimbun" speculates that Britain's mediation of the Sino-Japanese incident is due to the following motives: (1) Preventing Japan from further leaning towards the Axis powers; (2) Preventing Britain from making further concessions in the Far East; (3) Protecting the Chongqing government and befriending the United States.

<h3>"Friends of Wounded Soldiers" Movement, Donations From All Sides Are Extremely Enthusiastic, Huge Amounts of Donations Continue to Be Received After the Final Announcement</h3>
<p>Chongqing: The Chongqing Friends of Wounded Soldiers General Society launched the "Friends of Wounded Soldiers" solicitation movement during the sixth anniversary of the New Life Movement this year. For a time, all sectors of the country enthusiastically responded and actively participated. At the final announcement on July 20th, it was announced that donations reached 1,362,505.74 yuan. Although the solicitation movement has ended, enthusiastic groups and individuals at home and abroad continue to remit donations to the society. As of the 15th of this month, the society has successively received a total of (1,886,205.35) yuan in donations, an extremely impressive achievement. Groups donating over 200,000 yuan include the Hong Kong Women's Group Solicitation Wounded Soldiers Movement Committee.

<h3>National Government Invests 300 Million Yuan in Sichuan Province</h3>
<p>Chongqing: According to an official announcement today regarding the Sichuan Province Productivity Survey, the National Government has invested 300 million yuan in various private industries in Sichuan Province over the past three years. The survey of China's ability to meet wartime needs has found that China does not lack sources of industrial strength, as the estimated coal reserves in Sichuan Province are 900 billion tons, and the maximum possible hydroelectric power is 20 million horsepower, which can be developed along many inland rapid rivers. In the past three years, financial convenience in Sichuan Province has made significant progress. Government banks have established 250 branches throughout the province. There are many types of industrial products, especially progress has been made in textile production, and cotton cultivation has also developed quite well. The survey also briefly mentions the various difficulties arising from the current situation, stating that although Sichuan has a population of about 50 million, the current manpower is quite exhausted for various transportation projects and military service. Refugees from various places coming to Sichuan Province are of no help in solving the labor problem, as they mostly belong to the middle class and are not accustomed to manual labor. However, the proper utilization of the disaster-stricken laborers will alleviate this difficult problem. The survey also stated that although Sichuan Province's iron reserves are only 63 million tons, what is noteworthy is that this amount has not yet been developed. (20th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Bans Tea Exports, All Exports Are Prohibited Except for Those with Special Permits, This Ban is a Concession to Japan</h3>
<p>Hong Kong: Hong Kong has recently banned tea exports. All tea leaves are prohibited from being exported, except for those with special permits. This ban is generally considered to be another concession to Japan, as the Sino-Soviet trade agreement stipulates that the Soviet Union will supply China with military supplies, and China will allow the Soviet Union to monopolize the export of tea, which is transported through Hong Kong.

The correspondent also stated that the broad reasons for the Soviet Union's conclusion of a pact with Germany still exist unchanged, as the Soviet Union's current policy is primarily aimed at avoiding involvement in the war.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Germany Offers Britain Peace</h3>
<p>German leader Adolf Hitler made a speech to his country's parliament the night before last, in which he said, "My conscience compels me to appeal to Britain again, it is useless to continue the war;" and "If the British ignore this again, tragedy will surely come." In addition, he reiterated the loyalty and bravery of the German military and people, the close alliance between Germany and Italy, and the stability of Soviet-German relations; and while criticizing Britain for expanding the scope of the European war, he stated that one of the tenets of the German National Socialist Party's program is to "demand the revision of the Treaty of Versailles by possible peaceful means;" and he stated that Hitler's foreign policy of seeking peace is to "obtain the friendship of Italy and the understanding of Britain, in order to promote world cooperation." Regardless of what the consequences of this speech may be, it is certainly an important event in the European war.</p>
<p>Before discussing this further, let us first state two points clearly: First, according to the summary of the speech transmitted last night, Hitler suggested peace, but he did not mention the United States at all, which is implicitly an important factor in world peace; and he did not pay attention to the clamorous political tide in Tokyo, which called for strengthening the Axis relationship between Germany and Italy. Second, according to the London dispatch last night, British officials refused to criticize this speech; some said that Britain has the determination to resist the war and is prepared for all eventualities; however, it is presumed that the British authorities will not "ignore this again" and respond with silent preparation for war, right? How to respond will not only be a great debate worthy of the situation, but also what the future of the European situation hinges upon, so please wait and see.</p>
<p>The outbreak of this European war was caused by long-standing historical facts, which stimulated and impacted each other: the viewpoints of both sides are different, and the arguments are naturally different; although the right and wrong are left to later historians, it is difficult to reach a conclusion. As it has evolved to the current stage, if we further compare the resources, manpower, strategy, and war preparations of Britain and Germany separately, measure their strengths and weaknesses, and deduce the gains and losses of continuing the war, how it will win or lose? Then, whether it is the warring parties, they will inevitably be driven by emotion and unwilling to show weakness; even those who are outside the situation, or because of their love and hatred, it is difficult to be appropriate; moreover, war is dangerous and the opportunities are various, it is never possible to foresee the results based on figures on paper in advance. Churchill said that the German offensive will inevitably fail; Hitler said that Britain's continued war will inevitably lead to destruction. What the two said can be believed to be based on their own confidence and are not empty talk; however, it is obvious that each is betting the fate of their country, and there will inevitably be one winner and one loser, but who will win and who will lose is unknown. However, on the eve of repeatedly winning battles and attacking Britain, Germany suddenly made an appeal for peace in a posture of pulling back from the brink. Although the spirit and conditions under which peace will be sought, whether it will be harmonious with us, and whether it will be successful with us, there are many questions; if peace fails and it is necessary to resort to war again, then which country should bear the blame and the responsibility is even heavier; however, as far as the current stage is concerned, we cannot but say that the choice of peace or war lies with Britain. Will the British authorities seriously consider the responsibility of this choice?</p>
<p>We have heard Britain's arguments for declaring war on Germany. Based on those arguments, there should be no room for consideration of peace or war; regardless of success or failure, only war is possible. However, is there no room for Britain's arguments to change? Are there not already facts that allow for a change? Hasn't Britain itself already trodden the path of change? Or are Britain's arguments consistent from the beginning? We do not want to list all the events from the Munich Agreement to the Tokyo Agreement and examine them one by one in relation to Britain's arguments for war; we do not want to reiterate that the representatives of the official governments of Belgium and France withdrew from this battlefield, and study whether this caused the arguments to lose their general international nature; listing them, reiterating them, examining them, and studying them only increases pain and stimulation, so it is better to stop. However, in the current stage, Germany has not already won and forced a surrender, and Britain has not already lost and offered terms of submission; therefore, there should be equal peace talks. Since Hitler has said that continuing the war is useless and that he is compelled by his conscience to appeal again, who does not have a heart of compassion? Try to assess his sincerity, it is necessary to approach this with sincerity. Peace talks may break down due to uncoordinated conditions, but Hitler has not yet clearly shown Britain conditions that would be unacceptable; peace talks may be coerced because enemy troops are on the border, but the German army is still overseas from Britain, peace if an agreement can be reached, war if it cannot; so, what is wrong with accepting the proposal to test the conditions? The changes brewing in the international situation are too numerous to prevent; saying that the brewing is beneficial to Britain, we suspect that it is not, and this is especially evident in the Far East. Therefore, if the European war ends before the Far Eastern war, it cannot be said to be a loss for Britain!</p>
<h3>Hitler Makes a Final Plea for Peace to Britain in the Name of "Reason," Threatening Total War If Rejected, Confident That Germany Will Not Be the Destroyer in the End</h3>
<p>Berlin – In a special session of the Reichstag yesterday afternoon, Hitler delivered a speech, making a final appeal to Britain in the name of reason and common sense to cease the war that is bound to inflict terrible damage and great sacrifices on both sides. The final section stated, "In a contest between two strong powers, one must perish. Churchill may believe that the one to perish will be Germany, but I know that the one to perish will be Britain. I now feel a responsibility in my conscience to appeal to Britain once more. I am not a defeated supplicant, but a victor speaking in the name of reason, so I may as well make this appeal. I see no reason why this war must continue. I am always saddened by the sacrifices required by any war. I should also avert the scourge of war for my own people. I know that millions of Germans are extremely eager to resolve everything with the enemy who declared war on us twice for no reason, but I also know that many women in the country who are prepared to sacrifice everything are still willing to sacrifice. Churchill may again ignore my words and say that my words are issued out of doubt about his final victory. If that is the case, then I can face the future with a clear conscience. Looking back over the past few months, we have accomplished great things under the protection of God, and we are deeply grateful to God for guiding our determination and giving us guidance in our difficult work. As for myself, I am especially moved that God has entrusted me with the important task of restoring our freedom and glory."</p>
<p>Before Hitler spoke, Italian Foreign Minister Ciano was seated in the front row, and many members of parliament were in military uniform. First, General Göring delivered an opening speech, praising the fallen soldiers and saying that the National Assembly would ensure that the families of the fallen would be spared from hunger and cold. (Reuter's dispatch from the 20th)</p>
<h3>Full Text of Hitler's Speech</h3>
<p>Berlin – Führer Hitler arrived at the Great Hall of the Reichstag at 6:45 PM yesterday and immediately declared the meeting open, with Speaker Göring presiding. First, he led a moment of silence for the fallen soldiers, followed by condolences for the fallen Italian soldiers, especially Air Force Commander General Balbo. Italian Foreign Minister Ciano was seated in the first row of the diplomatic section. Führer Hitler stood up amidst thunderous applause and delivered a speech, first stating the reasons for convening the Reichstag: (1) To show the historical significance of the events people are encountering today; (2) To thank our loyal and brave soldiers; (3) To make a final rational appeal to all parties.</p>
<p>First Statement of the Causes of the War</p>
<p>Hitler forcefully stated that those who have caused this unprecedented conflict in history must recognize that the sacrifices of this conflict are disproportionate to its causes. In other words, unless the causes contain other hidden intentions, they are definitely not worth such great sacrifices. Hitler stated that the National Socialist movement's foreign policy plan was to use peaceful means to revise all the circumstances created by the Treaty of Versailles. The Treaty of Versailles not only sought to humiliate and discriminate against the Germanic people but also sought to destroy this cultured nation. The League of Nations not only failed to become an organ for rational revision of the Treaty of Versailles but also guaranteed its implementation. Therefore, the goals of the National Socialist movement were, in addition to overthrowing the rule of Jewish capitalists internally, to liberate Germany from the shackles of the Treaty of Versailles externally. Over the years, Germany has repeatedly attempted to find peaceful means of revision. When international cooperation was established on September 29, 1938, by the Munich Agreement, and a glimmer of hope appeared in resolving this issue, British and French public opinion clamored, accusing the government of weakness and slandering knowledgeable members of the opposition party as Germany's "Fifth Column." At the same time, international financial magnates believed that war could make their trade prosper, and they stirred up trouble, such as Britain and France inciting Poland to resist. Are the sacrifices they suffered and the results they obtained commensurate with what Germany originally requested? In the end, what Germany proposed was only Danzig and the traffic between Germany and East Prussia. However, Poland, seduced by international warmongers, rejected Germany's direct proposal and engaged in a war of terror. As evidenced by the shocking secret documents of the British and French Supreme Defense Council seized by German soldiers at the Paris station on June 19 this year, it is even more evident that the small countries are merely tools of the British and French military and political leaders. Recalling that before the war broke out, the United States had made a peace appeal, and on October 6, I (Hitler referring to himself) again proposed a peace proposal in the Reichstag, but the British and French authorities brazenly started the war, thinking I was weak. Chamberlain, incited by warmongers such as Churchill, Cooper, and Belisha, publicly vilified me. Therefore, I reorganized the army and strengthened the troops to undertake new tasks."</p>
<p>German Forces Strike First</p>
<p>Hitler mentioned that military action was postponed last winter due to bad weather. It was not until March this year that Germany received intelligence that Britain and France were planning something regarding the Soviet-Finnish War, with the aim of harming Russia rather than assisting Finland, because it was Germany's ally. At that time, Britain and France decided to intervene in the Soviet-Finnish War in order to obtain a base in the Baltic Sea and expand the war to the Balkans and the Near East. At the same time, in order to prevent Germany from obtaining Swedish iron ore, Britain and France planned to attack Sweden. "When I saw that the crisis of Northern Europe being dragged into the war had become unusually clear, I issued orders to the German army. Although Churchill wanted to deploy troops to attack the German navy first, the German army's preemptive strike completely failed. This campaign is the most courageous achievement in German military history, thanks to the dedicated efforts of the officers and soldiers of the navy, army, and air force.</p>
<p>Victory on the Western Front Strategy</p>
<p>Hitler continued by mentioning the war on the Western Front, stating that before the Norwegian war had ended, the French army had begun to move to the French-Belgian border. After holding staff talks with Belgium and the Netherlands, British and French troops had a tendency to attack German industrial areas. I then instructed the navy, army, and air force to make all necessary preparations. On May 6th and 7th, multiple calls were made between London and Paris, showing that the "Allied Powers" had the possibility of attacking Belgium and the Netherlands at any time. Therefore, on May 8th, I ordered the German army to begin the attack at dawn on the 10th. This time, my strategy was different from the Schlieffen Plan of 1914, focusing on the left wing and adopting an encirclement tactic against the large French army densely deployed in Belgium and the Netherlands. My plan proceeded smoothly. Hitler detailed the war in France and Belgium until Pétain begged for surrender, forcefully stating that the air force was effective due to the skillful command of General Göring, and his contribution was particularly significant. On the army side, the overall planning and deployment of General Keitel, Commander-in-Chief of the National Defense Forces, was outstanding. Domestically, Deputy Führer Hess, SA Chief of Staff Lutze, and Political Police Chief Himmler provided support and assistance. In addition, Propaganda Minister Goebbels, Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, and others all made meritorious contributions to the party and the country.</p>
<p>Promotions and Awards for Generals</p>
<p>Hitler then announced that in addition to being promoted to the rank of Field Marshal of Greater Germany, Göring was also awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross. Other generals promoted to the rank of Field Marshal included: (1) General Keitel, Commander-in-Chief of the National Defense Forces; (2) General Brauchitsch, Commander-in-Chief of the Army; (3) General Rundstedt, Commander of the Army Group; (4) General Leeb, Commander of the Army Group; General Bock, Commander of the Army Group; (5) General List, Commander of the Army Group; (6) General Kluge, Commander of the Army Group; (7) General Reichenau, Commander of the Army Group; (8) General Weichs; (9) General Milch, Undersecretary of the Air Force; (10) General Sperrle, Air Force General; (11) General Kesselring, Air Force Commander.</p>
<p>Satisfied with German-Italian Cooperation</p>
<p>The Führer mentioned the current political situation, saying that his foreign policy plans were: first, to obtain genuine friendship and understanding with Italy, and second, to obtain the same relationship with Britain. But despite my various efforts, I have ultimately failed to obtain friendship with Britain, otherwise, it would have been of profound and great benefit to the future happiness of both countries. However, I am still deeply fortunate for the success of the first point. This should be attributed to the genius of the Italian people's leader. When Britain and France were about to start a war against Germany last year, I and Mussolini established an agreement that should be observed by both countries. Germany's gains from Italy's attitude were enormous, benefiting both economically and militarily. Italy's participation in the war was entirely of its own choice, first fighting in the Alps, and now using the revolutionary spirit of fascism to carry out large-scale attacks with the navy and air force. We are now following closely behind in the spirit of National Socialism. Our political and military cooperation can be described as perfect, and as a result, we will achieve a joint victory.</p>
<p>Ability to Sustain Warfare</p>
<p>Regarding the current and future situation, the Führer stated that according to the various developments of the past ten months, it has proven the correctness of my observations and the errors of the enemy. Germany has been strengthened by victory. Germany's losses this time are considered extremely small compared to the World War. The number of losses in the war in Norway and the war in the Netherlands and France is negligible compared to the total amount of production. The supply of munitions is endless, and even production must be restricted. As far as the raw materials required for the war, coal and iron are concerned, even if imports are stopped, it will have no impact on Germany. As for the abundance of food, there is nothing to fear, no matter how long the war lasts. The enemy uses various propaganda methods to undermine the unity of the German people, but the people's attitude is not moved in the slightest. The war in October has only strengthened the people's determination.</p>
<p>Friendly German-Soviet Relations</p>
<p>Hitler continued by describing Germany's relationship with various countries, stating that German-Soviet relations have been determined, and it is a naive fantasy to hope that German-Soviet relations will become tense again. Neither Germany nor the Soviet Union has taken steps beyond their spheres of influence in Poland.</p>
<p>Peace or Destruction</p>
<p>Hitler recalled that he delivered a speech on October 6 last year, making peace proposals to Britain and France. Currently, France has a different view on the rejection of peace at that time, but the politicians of Britain, not the people of Britain, are still calling for the continuation of the war. Do these politicians have the correct understanding to continue the war? They do not hesitate for Britain to be occupied, but the British people cannot all move to Canada and will remain in Britain. Churchill declared that he needed the war. He started the air raids on German civilians six weeks ago, bombing undefended cities and villages. Germany did not retaliate, knowing that if it did, the British people would suffer. At that time, Churchill and the warmongers would have fled to Canada. Churchill should at least trust this prediction, that the great world empire will be destroyed. Germany has no intention of destroying or infringing upon this world empire. The continuation of the war will lead to the complete destruction of one of the belligerent countries. Does Churchill think that Germany will be destroyed? I know that the one to be destroyed will be Britain.</p>
<p>Final Appeal to Britain</p>
<p>At present, I believe that I have the responsibility on my conscience to urge Britain to use common sense. I believe I can make this appeal because I am not making an appeal from a defeated country, but the rational words of a victorious country. I do not see any urgent reason to continue the war. I regret the soldiers sacrificed in the war, and I also hope that the German people will be spared from the scourge of war. I know that the German young men are eager to fight against the enemies who declared war on Germany for no reason. Churchill may again regard my remarks as an expression of doubt about Germany's final victory, but at least I will not feel uneasy in my conscience about the future development. At the end of his speech, Hitler conveyed his animosity to the soldiers who served the country. (Haitong dispatch from the 20th)</p>
<h3>General Göring Warns Britain: Whether the War Can Be Avoided Depends on Britain's Attitude</h3>
<p>Berlin – Before the close of the Reichstag, General Göring, in his capacity as Speaker, addressed all members, briefly stating, "One World War has ended, and another great war is about to happen. Whether it will happen depends on whether Hitler's appeal can be accepted by the other party." Göring's statement is regarded as a warning to Britain, "saying that Führer Hitler is prepared to launch a blitzkrieg against Britain at any time." Göring also said, "Germany's tactics are quite like a miracle, and also a revolution of various war principles that have been praised for a time. This tactic has destroyed all the enemy's plans. All German people believe in this novel and miraculous weapon. Now Germany's novel tactics are not only recognized by all Germans but also by the whole world."

<p>London – King George VI personally inspected several military aircraft fields today and inspected the air force. (Havas dispatch from the 19th)</p>
<h3>Speculation on the Contents of Peace Terms</h3>
<p>Basel – A reporter from a local newspaper stationed in Berlin claimed that Germany's offensive against Britain has been slowed down in order to establish and test a new political action. (Reuter's dispatch from the 20th)</p>
<p>Tokyo – A reporter from the Allied News Agency stationed in Berlin claimed that it is expected that the war in Europe will be temporarily quiet in the next few days because Hitler must wait for Britain's reaction to the peace proposals he made in his speech to the Reichstag. If Britain firmly rejects it, then Germany will launch a full-scale attack on Britain. From the general sentiment in Germany, the contents of the peace terms seem to be: (1) The withdrawal of Churchill and his faction from the British government, and their replacement by a cabinet centered on Lloyd George and the British fascist leader Mosley; (2) The reduction of British armaments and the recognition of Germany's hegemony in Europe. The reporter concluded that it is almost certain that Britain will reject Germany's terms. (Reuter's dispatch from the 20th)</p>

<h3>German Planes Fly Low and Bomb, Intense Air Battles Over the Entire British Territory, Eleven German Planes Shot Down, British Air Force Flies to Germany to Retaliate</h3>
<p>London – After yesterday's major air raid by German aircraft, German aircraft intruded into British airspace again today, dropping bombs and engaging in a deadly battle with British fighters over a vast area of the sky. It is reported that the intensity of this air battle is unprecedented since the war. Today, German aircraft activity in British territory is extensive, with German aircraft detected over the southeast and southwest of Scotland, and the southwest and northeast of England, with reports of dense anti-aircraft fire. Near a certain mining town in southeastern Scotland, only fire was seen lighting up the sky, and the fire spread, covering a distance of one mile. This is a brief report of today's German air raid on Britain. As for yesterday, when Führer Hitler hinted that the "most terrifying war in the world" was about to come, the British and German air forces were engaged in fierce attacks against each other. After German Stuka dive bombers were discovered from the clouds, they dropped high-explosive bombs on British convoys off the southeast coast of England like a sudden rainstorm. The British Air Force flew into German territory in retaliation. Factories and oil depots in Bremen, Hanover, and Essen were reportedly bombed and burned. The famous Krupp artillery factory was also bombed. According to British Air Force reports, the explosion was clearly visible when the factory was hit. Yesterday's unprecedented low-altitude bombing of the British coast by German planes can be described as unprecedented. Twenty-two powerful Stuka dive bombers dived low from the clouds at the same time, carrying out large-scale destruction. British naval anti-aircraft guns and fighters fiercely resisted after the German planes were discovered, lasting for several hours. At that time, only machine gun fire, anti-aircraft gun fire, and bomb sounds were heard along the coast, and the windows of various towns along the coast were shattered, but there was no news of any British ships being hit. The scope of British planes bombing northwest Germany and the Rhineland was also wide, lasting for a long time. According to the Ministry of Aviation, the airfield of Mülhausen, Paderborn, Rothenburg, Rommerskirchen, and Xanten were successively bombed and damaged by the British Air Force on Thursday evening and last night. The fuel depots in Harlington, Bremen, and Norway were also bombed and burned. (United Press dispatch from the 20th)</p>
<p>London – According to the Ministry of Aviation's communique last night, twenty-two German bombers attacked ships over the British coast yesterday afternoon, dropping twenty bombs. No British ships were hit. Anti-aircraft guns fired at them, eventually driving the German planes out to sea. One crew member of a German plane jumped out with a parachute. It is believed that the plane has fallen into the Strait. Yesterday, British fighters and anti-aircraft guns fought fiercely with a large number of enemy planes several times off the southeast coast of England. Eight enemy planes were shot down by British fighters, and one was shot down by anti-aircraft fire. Several other planes were damaged. A total of eleven enemy planes were shot down yesterday, including four bombers and seven fighters. (Reuter's dispatch from the 20th)</p>
<p>Berlin – Last night, officials here announced that this afternoon, German Air Force personnel, flying several Messerschmitt 109 fighters, shot down twelve British new Defiant fighters, two Spitfires, and one Hurricane over the Strait. We suffered no losses. (Haitong dispatch from the 20th)</p>
<h3>Italian Foreign Minister Visits Hitler for Important Talks</h3>
<p>London – According to Swiss radio news, Hitler received Italian Foreign Minister Ciano at noon today, with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop also in attendance. (Reuter's dispatch from the 20th)</p>
<p>Berlin – Ciano will depart from Berlin tonight and return to Rome. Today, Ciano met with Hess and General Göring and attended a grand event held by the Italian Embassy in Germany. German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop hosted a banquet to welcome Ciano, and the guests and hosts had a pleasant time. (Haitong dispatch from the 20th)</p>
<h3>Germany's Peace Gesture is Received Coldly by Britain, Recognized as a Sincere Effort; Resistance to Aggression is Well-Prepared</h3>
<p>Stockholm – London Radio last night commented on Hitler's speech to the Reichstag, saying that Britain felt cold about the peace proposals, and Britain was determined to move forward with an indomitable spirit to achieve the goal of victory. (Haitong Agency dispatch from the 20th)</p>
<p>London – Officials here last night closely followed Führer Hitler's speech to the Berlin Parliament, stating that Führer Hitler's "vague peace gesture" would not be accepted by Britain. It is recognized here that Führer Hitler's speech was an insincere attempt to arouse the peace elements here and weaken Britain's combat power. (United Press dispatch from the 20th)</p>
<p>London – A diplomatic reporter from Reuters said that connoisseurs here believe that Hitler's speech is empty and worthless, and only berates the British Prime Minister, so it is not worth an official reaction. Of course, the Prime Minister will state his views in the House of Commons, as for the value of Hitler's speech, the readers can judge for themselves. (Reuter's dispatch from the 20th)</p>
<p>London – After German Führer Hitler delivered a speech in the German House of Commons today to launch peace talks, observers here commented that the British government should propose a formal reply, the gist of which is to defend Hitler's claim that Britain did not hesitate to destroy the neutrality of small countries in order to expand the scope of the war. Political figures claim that the German Führer's desire for neutral countries to come forward to mediate so as to quickly end the war has been expressed in this speech. However, other people believe that Germany knows that attacking Britain will inevitably encounter great difficulties, and this speech is to urge the German people to prepare for a long war. As for British officials, they refuse to comment on this speech, only saying that Prime Minister Churchill delivered a speech a few days ago, reiterating his determination to resist the war, which is a clear reply to Hitler. In short, Britain has made large-scale preparations to resist the enemy's attack, and everything is well prepared. (Havas dispatch from the 19th)</p>
<h3>Hitler's Speech is Clearly Issued Internally</h3>
<p>Washington – The first impression of Hitler's speech here is that the main purpose of Hitler's speech is issued internally, and there are no naval officers among the military personnel announced by Hitler, which shows that the German Navy has not won glory. Hitler's statement that one of Britain and Germany will perish in the struggle shows the terrifying nature of the struggle he intends to carry out at present. People here do not believe that Britain will consider Hitler's indirect peace proposals, and it is predicted that large-scale struggles will begin in a matter of days or even hours. (Reuter's dispatch from the 20th)</p>
<p>New York – Today, the "New York World-Telegram" stated that Hitler's speech in the Reichstag yesterday was a "masterpiece of false compassion and distortion of facts." The newspaper also said that this war is not only a desperate struggle, but a war in which if Britain survives, Hitlerism will be destroyed. The "New York Times" stated that Hitler's ultimatum is the same as before in form and substance, containing the same falsified history as Hitler's previous several speeches.

<h3>The Italian Government Praises it as a Great Political Action</h3>
<p>Rome – The Italian official news agency stated that Rome welcomes Hitler's speech, praising it as a "great political action" and a "great victorious speech by a great statesman." Hitler's mention of Italy is welcomed by the Weimar side. (Reuter's dispatch from the 20th)</p>
<h3>Australia Increases its Defense Strength; Prime Minister Menzies Announces that a Large Army is Massed in the Barracks</h3>
<p>Sydney – Australian Prime Minister Menzies stated last night that the great changes in the European situation make it impossible to predict when Australia and Australian troops will be needed overseas. At present, a large army is massed in the Australian barracks. For this reason, the military force waiting to be dispatched in Australia will be temporarily limited to 80,000 people, and new recruits will have to be temporarily suspended. There are already 77,000 soldiers in the barracks everywhere, which is more than at any time during the last war. Australia is now doing its best to increase the strength of the National Defense Forces to 250,000 people. (Reuter's dispatch from the 20th)</p>
<p>Sydney – Australia's comments on Hitler's speech can be seen in the following remarks of Australian Prime Minister Menzies, who said that the Germanic Empire, which is based on tyranny and bloodshed, will be destroyed, not only because Britain insists on fighting, but the British Empire is no exception. (Reuter's dispatch from the 20th)</p>
<h3>Canada Reaffirms its Determination and Vows to Back Britain</h3>
<p>Ottawa – The general public in Canada believes that the peace proposals made by Hitler in his speech yesterday did not contain any language worthy of consideration by the British Empire. These proposals are intended to cover the ears and eyes of the Germans and neutral countries. Some observers recognize that Hitler's speech contains an indication that he will invade Britain soon. However, the Canadian people reaffirm and back Britain to the last man. Canadians are not at all troubled by Hitler's claim that the British government will move to Canada, because Canadians understand that if the British government takes this action, it will be nothing more than a plan to continue the war.

It is rumored that General Ironside will continue to serve in an active capacity as an advisor or to command troops. (Reuters report, 20th)</p>

(20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Hong Kong. Tokyo dispatch. The results of Konoe's cabinet formation have not yet been announced. However, since the selections for the Ministers of Foreign Affairs, Army, and Navy have been decided, it is widely believed that Konoe will select full-time ministers for the six ministries of Interior, Finance, Commerce and Industry, Agriculture and Forestry, Education, and Justice. The remaining four ministries of Communications, Railways, Colonial Affairs, and Welfare will be concurrently held by other ministers. The Army Minister of the Yonai Cabinet, Shunroku Hata, Vice Minister Anami, and other important figures held a meeting at 10:40 this morning to hear Hideki Tojo's report on the results of yesterday's meetings with Konoe, Matsuoka, and Yoshida. It is reported that a consensus was reached on basic policies regarding diplomacy and national defense during yesterday afternoon's meeting. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo. Japan's new Prime Minister Konoe stated that he had discussed resolving Sino-Japanese disputes, strengthening Japanese-German-Italian relations, and the policies Japan intends to adopt toward Britain and the United States with the new Army Minister Lieutenant General Hideki Tojo, Navy Minister Admiral Zengo Yoshida, and Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka. Their opinions were quite harmonious. (Haitong News Agency report, 20th)</p>
<p>Tokyo. When Prime Minister Konoe met with reporters yesterday, he stated that he is currently busy forming a new cabinet, so the nationwide single-party movement may be delayed for some time. As for the new cabinet's attitude towards existing parties and future new political structures, no decision has yet been made. His original intention was to create a new political structure as a private citizen. However, due to the trend of the situation, he had to accept the mandate and form a new cabinet. In short, the new cabinet and the new structure are one and two, and two and one. However, it is difficult to proceed with the two simultaneously, and the organization of the new structure will have to be postponed for the time being. (Havas report, 19th)</p>
<p>Moscow. The "Pravda" published a commentary today, discussing the changes in the Japanese cabinet. The newspaper stated, "The Yonai cabinet resigned due to pressure from the military. Konoe, who was ordered to form a cabinet, represents the military's expectations in both domestic and foreign affairs. He is the inventor of the 'construction of a new order in East Asia' and also initiated Japan's 'National Mobilization Law.' In short, the change in the Japanese cabinet is a harbinger of drastic changes in Japan's domestic and foreign policies." (TASS report, 19th)</p>
<p>Rome. Italian side welcomed the new Japanese cabinet formed by Fumimaro Konoe yesterday, it will move Japan further along the road to joining the Rome-Berlin military and political axis.

<h3>US Democratic Party Delegates Return Home Joyfully, But Anxious About the General Election; Farley Familiar with Political Life</h3>
<p>Chicago. The delegates of the Democratic Convention have joyfully set out to return home after listening to the speech of President Roosevelt's instigator, but they are anxious about the prospect of the election in November. They are all aware that there is no other way but to elect President Roosevelt for another term, but those who respect Roosevelt mostly feel that it is too long for one person to be in power continuously for twelve years. Many people are still indignant about the convention being controlled by President Roosevelt's friends. Democratic vice-presidential candidate Wallace must strive to campaign vigorously in the agricultural states in order to achieve his goals. However, Wallace was opposed by Southern Democrats at the convention, who felt that the vice-presidential seat should be held by a Democrat from the South in order to be fair. According to past practice, any Democratic Party must win the powerful votes of the Southern states to win. Since the incumbent president and vice-presidential candidates hold the same foreign policy, the focus of the campaign will be on domestic policy, that is, whether the country is willing to continue the effectiveness of the philosophy of new measures. (Reuters report, 20th)</p>
<p>Washington. An anti-Roosevelt third-term movement has occurred within the Democratic Party. The Republican National Committee announced that former US Army Commander Chadwick has joined Nebraska Senator Burke to oppose the Democratic Party and provide assistance to Republican candidate Willkie. At the same time, Southern California Senator Smith announced that he will not assist President Roosevelt's re-election. He said, "But at the same time, I will not vote for the Republican Party." The Republican National Committee quoted Chadwick as saying, "A third term will endanger our democratic spirit." At the same time, Senator Burke predicted that a Democratic People's Congress will be organized to support Willkie and oppose Roosevelt's re-election policy. (United Press report, 20th)</p>
<p>Chicago. Postmaster Farley announced today that he will resign from his position as chairman of the Democratic National Convention and will discuss his departure from the cabinet with President Roosevelt. Farley strongly supported Visforth and Wallace in this election. (Reuters report, 19th)</p>
<p>Chicago. The chairman of the Democratic National Committee, Farley, officially resigned yesterday after the campaign convention closed. From now on, he will not be involved in politics and will end his life with the pastime of baseball. It was previously rumored that Farley would organize a board of directors, serve as chairman, and purchase the New York American baseball club from the successor of the late Rupert. This rumor has now been confirmed by Farley himself. There have been many rumors about Farley's whereabouts in the past few weeks. Some said Farley would be elected president, some said he would become a leader in the automatic machine industry, and some said he would continue his political activities in other fields. However, all these rumors have now been dispelled. (International News Service report, 20th)</p>
<h3>Most Americans Advocate Aid to Britain; 15,000 People Request to Join the Canadian Air Force</h3>
<p>New York. According to a recent survey by the Public Opinion Agency, the desire of the American public to aid Britain in various ways, apart from participating in the war, has not diminished slightly due to the defeat of France. The opinions of voters from both the Democratic and Republican parties are rarely divided on this point. 53% believe that the United States should give Britain more assistance, 11% believe that the United States has already given sufficient assistance, 6% believe that the United States should give less assistance, 10% did not express an opinion, and among the aforementioned 53%, 15% advocate that the United States should declare war on Germany and Italy. (Reuters report, 20th)</p>
<p>Ottawa. An official spokesman said that more than 15,000 Americans have requested to join the Canadian Air Force. (International News Service report, 20th)</p>
<h3>Rumor that Germany Has Made Harsh Demands on Southern Nations, Coercing Them to Organize a New Right-Wing Cabinet; Turkey Decides to Ally with Britain</h3>
<p>Beijing. It is rumored that Germany has made harsh demands on Yugoslavia to align its policies with the Rome-Berlin Axis. It is heard that the German ambassador to Yugoslavia, Heinar, visited the Yugoslav regent, Prince Paul, at his summer retreat, demanding that he organize a new right-wing cabinet. This new action by Germany in Yugoslavia is believed to be an indication that Germany's influence in the Balkans is expanding. Recalling that the Soviet army entered Pukanova against Germany's wishes two days ago, diplomatic circles here are closely watching the future situation. (International News Service report, 20th)</p>
<p>Ankara. The Istanbul "Janisbal" newspaper published an article, emphasizing Turkey's determination to stand with Britain, saying, "Turkey is full of confidence in its alliance with Britain and believes that Turkey will receive all possible assistance from its allies when necessary. As long as Britain stands firm, Turkey will not be attacked. If Britain wins, Turkey will not be harmed, and will emerge stronger from the current crisis. The reason for our alliance with Britain lies in this. As far as the Mediterranean naval battle is concerned, the fact that the Italian ships could not hold out for more than fifteen minutes is obvious. Needless to say, the British navy still holds the highest authority in the eastern and western parts of the Mediterranean, and this advantage is becoming increasingly strong. All countries that have lost their independence and freedom place their hopes on the final victory of the British navy, and this hope is becoming increasingly bright." The Turkish newspaper "Kenhreli" commented on British Prime Minister Churchill's statement that "Britain will soon not tolerate Germany's control of Europe," saying that Churchill's words prove that Britain does not intend to seek peace and is even prepared to fight a three-year war. Another Turkish newspaper, "Ulas", published an editorial titled "Britain's Insurmountable Determination," saying that Britain still stands firm and its naval and air forces are stronger than ever, and is not discouraged by the German army's conquest of territory in continental Europe.

<h3>German Wartime Morale</h3>
<p>When Germany started the war, many observers were inevitably worried about her. Now, after ten months of testing, coupled with various wartime difficulties coming one after another, the situation is better than initially expected, hoped for, or even thought possible. Although the German people are everywhere stretched thin by the difficulties of the wartime economy, and rumors abound; various productions and daily necessities are subjected to ruthless government intervention and control, especially in each season, the days are like years, almost unbearable. However, today, behind the military and political leaders of the National Socialist Party, they have created a stronger and more vigorous morale than at any time in the past four years. As a result, the German government can now rely on the people, their unity and unwavering determination have increased many times more than when the war began.</p>
<p>As for a government that uses military adventures to determine the fate of the country, the German people's morale at the beginning of the war can be said to be extremely bad. Most non-National Socialist Germans did not approve of the war at all at that time. This opposition was not based on moral concepts, but on the aversion to the horror of war. They really believed that if Germany made a do-or-die gamble, it would be impossible to survive. Over the years, the National Socialist Party failed to deeply imprint the power of the Soviet Union's propaganda on the minds of the Germans. The middle-aged people still remember the situation of the last war and the aftermath, how could they not be wary of the new war?</p>
<p>On the other hand, the German officials, party army, and the youth led by Hitler all believed that this war was just a continuation of Germany's heroic military policy of foreign expansion. In short, if we talk about the entire country, the situation in September of last year was quite critical. Now, regardless of the difficulties, the country has become united and the people's determination is very high.</p>
<p>Domestic hostility towards the National Socialist Party's regime has naturally weakened. In addition to this reason and the Soviet Union's confidence in its military power, there are two other factors that deserve our attention. One is that the "morale" organization is managed with political and police force, which is very strict and efficient. In the past ten months, the great police force created by Police Chief Himmler has proven to be effective after testing.</p>
<p>Another is the development of German solidarity since the start of the war. Most of the German people have confirmed that this war is an enemy attacking Germany, not attacking the National Socialist Party. Whether such an opinion can represent the most powerful general view, or is simply a harvest of clever and lasting propaganda, is left to be questioned. However, it is very believable that the views heard are not only limited to these. Even in private conversations with non-National Socialist Germans, they all say that this war was forced upon Germany by Britain, and that Germany was threatened by life and arbitrarily invaded. They listed the jealousy, fear, and suspicion of Germany by other countries as explanations or justifications for the current state. They have faintly forgotten the sins of invading Austria and Czechoslovakia, cleverly decorated them, or even put them behind their heads. The German people accept what the officials announce. Many middle-class and conservative intellectuals have now tended towards anti-British, which feels more real than the anti-National Socialist psychology they showed with trepidation one or two years ago. Some people, sometimes called "better Germans," mostly support National Socialist politics today, partly due to their own convictions and partly due to compulsion. Because of the forced environment, intense "patriotic madness" has become the center of their beliefs.</p>
<p>The unity of the whole country and the cooperation of all parties that opposed the current government in the past can be seen from all classes. Among the working class, regardless of their resentment towards wartime difficulties, they do not feel the slightest doubt about the necessity of fighting against "British oligarchy." The German working class has been persuaded by the authorities and has almost fallen into a hypnotic state. The belief that the Germans are fighting for a "new social order" is widely circulated in the minds of most people, consciously or unconsciously. (Translated from Manchester Guardian)</p>
<h3>Key to the Mediterranean</h3>
<p>Malta. Located between Sicily and Tunisia in Italy, it is a necessary route from the western to the eastern Mediterranean and has always been the key for Britain to dominate the Mediterranean. It has an area of 122 square miles and a population of over 200,000. The whole island is made of rock and has no soil. Soil is transported from Sicily to cultivate citrus, wheat, potatoes, cotton, etc. The island has been a French territory since 1798 and was occupied by Britain in 1800. The capital is called Valletta, located on the east coast of Malta. The harbor is surrounded by a number of small islands, the terrain is dangerous, and is rarely matched in the world. The British have copper walls and iron ramparts on the island, and there is also a strong fleet stationed there. It is called the heart of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>Gibraltar. A small peninsula at the southernmost tip of Spain, with an area of only two square miles, facing Morocco's Ceuta from afar, it is the gateway to the Mediterranean and a vital transportation hub. The center is a strait connecting the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean, 36 miles long and 15 miles wide at its narrowest point. The promontory is surrounded by cliffs on three sides, suitable for large ships to dock, and is a naturally formed fortress. The west is a slope, Gibraltar Bay, with a solid bastion. It originally belonged to Spain and has been in British hands since 1704. In 1779, France and Spain jointly attacked it with their navies for 43 months without success, which shows the dangerousness of its terrain. At present, the United Kingdom has strong fortresses and coaling stations on Windmill Hill at the southeast end of the peninsula, and has stationed heavy troops to control it. A military port is opened on the west bank to station warships. It echoes Malta to the east and is the naval base of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>Suez Canal. Located between Asia and Africa, it is the gateway to the Red Sea. When the French man, Lei Sai, supervised the Suez Canal, the British thought there was no possibility of success and completely ignored it. Who knew that in 1869, the Cape of Good Hope lost its importance, and the Suez Canal became a convenient route from the Mediterranean to the Indian Ocean. At that time, France's power in Egypt was very strong. The British immediately caught up. In less than 15 years, partly because Britain used violent policies against Egypt, and partly because French diplomacy failed to cope properly, the major rights of the Suez Canal shareholders fell into the hands of the British. As a result, the navigation from the eastern Mediterranean to India was completely in her tight grip.</p>
<p>Aden. Located on the southwest coast of the Arabian Peninsula, it controls the mouth of the Red Sea. It has an area of only 75 square miles and a population of 55,000. It was originally under the jurisdiction of Turkey and became independent in 1730, managed by a Muslim king. In 1836, a British ship was plundered in its territory, and the Muslim king ceded it to Britain. By 1839, it was entirely owned by Britain and under the jurisdiction of the Bombay Province of India. The site is a key point on the shipping routes between Europe and Asia, and is a key British coaling port. To the west is Perim Island in the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait, with an area of only five square miles, under the jurisdiction of Aden, guarding the mouth of the strait and controlling the throat of the Red Sea. The British have built a strong fortress on the island, so British-Indian transportation is worry-free.</p>

<h3>Finance: British and American Exchange Rates Rise and Fall, Running in Opposite Directions All Day Long</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: HSBC's listed prices were flat, and the British and American exchange rates in the black market ran in opposite directions throughout the day, rising and falling, which was very uncertain. Initially, because the New York pound suddenly rose by one jiao, the opening British exchange rate immediately softened to three ban shi eight four three seven five, while the US dollar hardened to six yuan two one eight seven five. Then, it was heard that HSBC Bank had a large amount of shillings for sale, so it hardened back to three ban shi eight seven five, and came to arbitrage US dollars. Later, news of the Sino-Soviet military alliance was added, and it was predicted that the pound would weaken today. Chinese banks and speculators took advantage of the cheap price to arbitrage US dollars, and Hong Kong Electricity sold a limited amount, so it softened to only six nine one two five. Finally, because the Sino-British Bank slightly sold off, it hardened slightly. The closing price was three ban shi eight five nine three seven five for British gold, six yuan one five six two five for US dollars, British tight zero four six eight seven five, and US flat. Futures were unanimously softening, and trading was very active. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday.</p>
<p>Spot British Tight, US No Change</p>
<p>In the early morning, due to large London strips, both near and far rose by 125. The New York silver price remained flat, the London raw gold remained fixed, the exchange rate of British against the US was unchanged, and there was no market against Shanghai or France. The US against the British rose by one jiao, there was no change against Shanghai, and there was no market against France. The central government's listed exchange rates remained the same. The bank's spot selling price was three ban shi eight four three seven five for British gold and six yuan two one eight seven five for US exchange, which was higher than the previous day's British tight zero six two five and the US dollar hardened zero six two five, which was due to the increase in the exchange rate. After the opening, speculators first had an appetite, and calculated that the US dollar was sold at six yuan one eight seven five in the American bank. HSBC announced that the listed price would not move, and the white silver balance tax was announced to increase by one point zero zero. After that, Hong Kong Electricity once blocked out the US dollar for this month, and foreign banks were willing to absorb it, and the market softened instead. It was calculated that the opening price was six yuan one eight seven five and one five six two five. At that time, news of the Sino-Soviet military alliance was spread, and people's hearts were slightly affected. Chinese merchants and Chinese banks tended to buy in, and it was calculated that the US dollar for August was sold by the American bank to Chinese merchants at six yuan one two five. Macgalley sold the US dollar for the same month to the Chinese bank at six yuan zero nine three seven five. It was heard that the tightest US dollar was advertised at six yuan one two five. By noon, the potential was still softening. Speculators again entered Macgalley and other US dollars for this month at six yuan one five six two five. The closing price was three ban shi eight five nine three seven five for British gold and six yuan one five six two five for US dollars. British gold for this month was the same price as spot, US dollar six yuan one two five, British gold for August three ban shi eight one two five, US dollar six yuan zero six two five. Compared with yesterday's closing price, spot British tight zero four six eight seven five, US no honor or disgrace, British for July shrink zero four six eight seven five, US soft zero three one two five, British and US for August each tight zero six two five and zero three one two five.</p>
<p>Hong Kong US Dollar Fluctuates Greatly</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 20th (Saturday) Electric: The exchange market opened flat this morning. The US dollar fluctuated greatly. The spot British dollar had no honor or disgrace. The spot US dollar was loose 125, at 23 yuan 75. The spot Shanghai dollar rose by one yuan, to 383 yuan (yesterday's closing price was 382 yuan), the spot Japanese dollar rose by half a yuan, to 100 yuan 05 jiao. At 9:55, the fluctuation was uncertain. The spot US dollar hardened 0625, to 23 yuan 6875. At 10:55, it was slightly loose. The spot US dollar returned to length 125, to 23 yuan 8125. At 11:30, it was advertised as loose. The spot US dollar continued to loosen 0625, to 23 yuan 875. The spot Shanghai dollar continued to rise by one yuan, to 384 yuan. The rest remained unchanged. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday.</p>
<p>Tianjin British Tight, US Turns Loose</p>
<p>Tianjin, 20th (Wednesday) Electric: The exchange market opened flat this morning. The spot British dollar was tight 0625, at three ban shi six two five. The spot US dollar was loose 03125, at five yuan seven eight one two five. The Shanghai dollar rose by two jiao and a half, to 107 yuan two jiao and a half. The black market for "Joint Notes" rose slightly by two jiao and a half, to 93 yuan and a half.</p>
<h3>Rumors Good, Gold Market Revives</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cash exchange black market situation was unexpected. The weekend delivery day suddenly rose in buying interest, and it was able to advance upward. This was because people's hearts were affected by various bullish rumors, and the rumored peaceful atmosphere has now completely disappeared. Moreover, there are reports of a Sino-Soviet military alliance, an emergency in Zhenhai, Ningbo, and news that a new Central Bank will open. It is rumored in the market, coupled with the fact that the profitable shorts in the middle of this week have reached the weekend and initially came to compensate, so in a situation of large gains and small returns, the price has jumped out of 5,300 yuan. People's hearts in all directions have turned firm, and the exchange market is quietly softening, and the price of gold is easy to rise and difficult to fall. The market was mediocre in the early morning, opening at 5,230 yuan, and fell to a low price of 5,205 yuan due to scattered retail sales. After 10:30, the exchange market strengthened, and securities gangs and gold shops successively entered the market to purchase, and demand increased sharply. Soon it rushed out of the 5,300 yuan mark. Although it was slightly fixed at noon, the closing price had been raised to 5,345 yuan, an increase of 125 yuan from the previous day. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday. The half-day transaction was first cleared and then strong, and it was estimated to be about 2,000 taels. The price of gold jewelry in silver shops was raised by 10 yuan, and the customs gold remained flat.</p>
<p>Exchange Red Rises 125 Yuan</p>
<p>From the morning, each piece (ten taels), initially the silver shop selling gold to the gold shop for ten taels, was still 5,220 yuan, with no honor or disgrace compared to the previous day. Then, because the securities gang slightly sold off, and at that time there was no shortage of retail sales to short, it stepped down by a small 15 yuan. Securities and hardware shops twenty taels, inferior to 5,205 yuan. Then, a certain money exchange business suddenly came to absorb fiercely, and the silver shop gang's appetite was very strong, and retail shorts saw the scene and hedged, and soon pulled up 55 yuan, the silver shop entered the money exchange business twenty taels, for 5,260 yuan. Later, a certain silver shop and securities gang sold off, plus a certain money exchange business also slightly returned, so it returned a small 20 yuan, the money exchange business sold to the silver shop fifty taels, for 5,240 yuan. At that time, many bullish news were frequently reported in the market, and the foreign exchange market strengthened as a result. The buying interest in the market followed, and securities gangs, silver shops, gold shops, etc. scrambled to arbitrage wildly, and soon rushed out of the 5,300 yuan mark. Silver shops did each other twenty taels, for 5,330 yuan. At this time, the buying interest slightly frustrated, and it was once seen to fall back to 5,310 yuan, but in the end, because people's hearts were upward, low prices came to search for purchases again, and the price was raised again by 30 to 40 yuan, the silver shop entered the gold shop twenty taels, for 5,345 yuan, as the noon closing price. As a result, it was 125 yuan higher than the previous day, with a range of 140 yuan in half a day. The selling price of the current gold shop's own brand gold was more than 10 yuan higher than the exchange price, and the purchase price was reduced by 30 yuan. The current spot gold was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there was little trading.</p>
<p>Gold Jewelry Only Raised by 10 Yuan</p>
<p>The exchange price of gold jewelry in silver shops was initially 540 yuan in Datonghang, but at around 11:00, it was raised by 10 yuan, and there was no change in the afternoon. It was calculated that Datonghang changed to 550 yuan, and the new counterparts were similar to the upper price, with the purchase price reduced by about 30 yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currency Suddenly Rises After Falling</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market situation: The British and American gold pounds first fell and then rose, and finally each rose by three yuan. There was continued demand for British gold tickets, and the market price remained high. The US gold ticket initially fell because the pound price rose sharply, and the supply was very smooth in the early morning. The market price retreated to 16 yuan and 08 points. Then, it was suddenly reported that there was a Sino-Soviet alliance, which caused the black market US dollar to step down, rising to 16 yuan, 3 jiao, and 2 points at noon. It slightly returned to 16 yuan, 3 jiao, and 2 points in the afternoon, still rising by 1 jiao and 4 points compared to the previous day. The Hong Kong ticket rose slightly by one point following the exchange rate between Hong Kong and Shanghai. There was no shortage of demand for Canadian and Philippine tickets, and the market prices uniformly rose. The Japanese gold ticket remained weak, and the evening price was 2 jiao and 1 point for hospitals. The supply and demand of Korean tickets were uniform, and the evening price remained 1 yuan and 3 points.</p>
<h3>Securities: Floating Short Positions Added, Domestic Debt Weak and Depressed</h3>
<p>Yesterday's black market situation for unified government bonds continued to show a decline and fell again. Because the situation in eastern Zhejiang was tense and rumors in Ningbo were inconsistent, there was a fear of bullishness. Therefore, the buying interest of the previous few days was suddenly swept away. Speculators and floating short positions took the opportunity to frequently add positions and sell heavily, resulting in an oversupply of chips on the table. The market atmosphere softened as a result. Renfeng, Renchang, Lianyi No. 5, etc. still had a buying interest, so the trend was soft and stable. However, because Lianhe, Hongda, Yongda, Lemao, etc. worked tirelessly, the price was suppressed. The market atmosphere was clear in the afternoon, and prices continued to decline. Although Xieda No. 64 and No. 35, etc. had a lot of intention to supply, under the pull of Jiufeng, Lianhe, Lianyi, etc., they slightly strengthened. However, as a result, except for Class D, which showed a slight improvement of 5 points due to supply and demand, the others unanimously continued to fall by 2 jiao to half a yuan. Turnover decreased, only about 800,000 yuan was weak. A brief table is listed as follows:</p>
<p>Stock trading: 40 shares of Ningshao Company stock were traded at a price of 13 yuan and 5 jiao.</p>
<p>London, 19th (Friday) Electric: The listed prices of various Far East British company stocks today were generally stable. Only the stock price of the Korean Coal Mine fell by two shillings and six pence, to four shillings. The rest remained unchanged.</p>
<p>London, 19th (Friday) Electric: The listed prices of Chinese foreign debts today remained stable. There were no changes in the upper and lower bonds.</p>
<h3>Financial Review - As of July 20 - Review of the Amount of Legal Tender Issued</h3>
<p>- Qiong</p>
<p>The Chinese government recently announced that the amount of legal tender issued by the four banks at the end of June of the 29th year was 396.2 million yuan, of which gold, silver, and foreign exchange accounted for 191.7 million yuan, accounting for 48.4% of the amount issued. This amount issued increased by 50.8% compared to the same period in the 28th year, compared to an increase of 52.1% in the 28th year compared to the 27th year. Although its absolute value increased, the relative value obviously decreased, which means that although the legal tender is increasing, its trend has slowed down.</p>
<p>Because of the increase in the amount of legal tender issued, people who generally want to slander it will never use reason to analyze the reasons for the increase in legal tender, and suddenly say that China has inflation, but from a rational and fair standpoint, it cannot be said that China has inflation, but only that the issuance of legal tender has increased. I have the following observations:</p>
<p>To understand the increase in the issuance of legal tender, we must first know what the issuance of legal tender was like before the war. It has only been four and a half years since the implementation of the legal tender system. This period can be divided into two stages, pre-war and wartime, to see the trend of legal tender issuance. In imagination, the wartime should develop more rapidly than the pre-war period, but the results of statistical analysis are completely opposite. Taking November of the 24th year before the war as 100 and the month of the 26th year as 100 in wartime, then its increase process is that the first year of the war only increased by more than 20%, less than one time in two years, and less than two times in three years, while it increased by more than one time in one year before the war, and about two times in two years. It can be seen that the issuance of legal tender was cautious during the war, and the Chinese government did not increase the issuance of legal tender as a means of raising war expenses.</p>
<p>Trends During the War Pre-War Trends</p>
<p>Or, it is said that the pre-war period was when the legal tender system was being established, and the wartime legal tender system was established to attack the above comparison. Then please see the following explanation. It is undeniable that the establishment of the legal tender system was not successful during the war. What can be said to be more successful is the Southeast provinces and some provinces in the middle. The widespread use of legal tender in the Southwest and Northwest provinces occurred after the outbreak of the war. The most important example is that Guangdong, Guangxi, and Yunnan only started to implement it effectively during the war. The Guizhou Provincial Government was still in the 27th year. In January, it issued an order to all counties requiring them to exchange all silver coins held for legal tender at the county government within three months. It can be seen that the legal tender system was still being promoted hard during the war and cannot be said to be completely successful. It is still recalled that in January of the 28th year, the Ministry of Finance also issued an order to all provincial governments strictly prohibiting the use of silver coins, and stipulated that the exchange of silver coins should increase the handling fee by 15%! (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Hardware: No Market for Domestic Pig Iron</h3>
<p>Hardware transactions have been sluggish due to the hot summer season and the increased difficulty of transportation, resulting in a sharp decline in sales from all sources. The market is deserted, people's hearts are depressed, and the prices of all commodities have seen a small decline. Pig iron is no exception. The only sales channel for pig iron is the iron factory in this street, but foreign merchants also have considerable sales. However, sales from all sources have been sluggish recently. On this street, there are only inquiries. For example, Indian goods No. 1 are sold for 665 yuan, and Citibank No. 1 is sold for 875 yuan (there is no market for domestic pig iron).</p>
<h3>Grains Still Have Short Selling in the Rice Market Otherwise, Why Would Short Sellers Rush to Cover? This Shows Market Supervision is Just Empty Talk</h3>
<p>Since the rice market showed tightness in the evening session the day before yesterday, when trading opened yesterday, sentiment turned firm.  Merchants and buyers were unwilling to easily let go, strongly resisting sales. Meanwhile, customers from the inland villages and local shops showed increasing interest.  Consequently, general short sellers who specialize in speculation also rushed to cover their positions.  The overall buying interest in the market suddenly surged, leading sellers to become even more confident, and prices were shouted higher and higher.  The market prices of various types of foreign rice gradually increased. As a result, the closing price was one yuan higher than the previous day. Number One Chen Saigon was priced at 55 yuan 8 jiao, 55 yuan 5 jiao. Chen Number Two was 53 yuan, 52 yuan 5 jiao. New rice was 52 yuan, 51 yuan 5 jiao. Number One Siam was 55 yuan 5 jiao, 55 yuan 2 jiao. Number Two was 51 yuan 5 jiao, 51 yuan. Fire-milled was 55 yuan, 54 yuan 5 jiao. Number One Hong Kong Point was 54 yuan 5 jiao, 54 yuan. Number Two was 52 yuan, 51 yuan 5 jiao. Number Three was 50 yuan 05 jiao, 50 yuan. Small milled point was 53 yuan. Tokyo Point was 49 yuan, down to 46 yuan 5 jiao. Rough Point was 43 yuan 5 jiao, 43 yuan. Broken Point was 42 yuan. The Number Two Siam rice shipped on the 26th was initially priced at 60 yuan 04 jiao, then quickly rose from 60 yuan 05 jiao to 61 yuan, also 7 jiao higher than the previous day. As for those shipped on the 20th, because the goods had already arrived at the port and required immediate payment, some speculative holders were eager to sell, causing the price to drop to 59 yuan at one point. However, because the Swatow merchants were still paying in cash, the final price returned to a favorable 60 yuan. The total transaction volume for the day was 400 tons, mainly driven by retail investors and short covering. There were also 7,000 to 8,000 transactions in spot rice.</p>
<p>The source of japonica and glutinous rice remained at just over a thousand bags of japonica, but sales remained sluggish regardless of official or unofficial channels. This was because the price was too high and still far from that of foreign rice. General merchants found it difficult to cope with retail sales, so the sellers attempted to compete with foreign rice by uniformly raising prices, but ultimately failed to achieve their goal, with only 3 to 5 jiao of price fluctuation. Special fresh Qing japonica from Kai Chang Province was priced at 68 yuan 5 jiao, 67 yuan. Wuxi Qing japonica was 66 yuan 5 jiao, 66 yuan. Powder japonica was 65 yuan. Changzhou Su Kun white japonica was as high as 65 yuan 5 jiao, 65 yuan. Zhongguan was 63-4 yuan. Suci was 60 yuan 5 jiao. Qing Si fresh thin rice was 66 yuan 5 jiao, 66 yuan. Da Shi was 64-5 yuan. Nangang fresh early rice was around 63 yuan, Su was 61 yuan, 60 yuan. Douchi was 59 yuan 5 jiao. Liyang fresh special yuan was 64 yuan. Jintan special yuan was around 63 yuan. Chang Dan goods were 61-2 yuan. Hong Kong white yuan was 60 yuan.</p>
<h3>Japanese Flour Floods the Market</h3>
<p>Flour: Yesterday was the weekend, and spot flour transactions were quite quiet. Upon investigation, the local sales were greatly impacted by the flooding of domestic and Japanese flour in the market. Customer sales, such as those in North China and Tianjin, were mostly for foreign flour, and Japanese flour had also gradually emerged in those areas. Therefore, the Shanghai flour market has long fallen into the hands of others. Yesterday, the price of Number Two flour from the Shanghai flour factory remained at 16 yuan, with each factory selling about 5,000 bags. Transactions of other brands of flour were also rare, and prices were generally sluggish.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday's transactions were also quiet. Because the Japanese Hongkou arrived, in addition to allocating for Japanese factories, most were put on the stacks to be sold. It was very difficult for Chinese factories to buy at low prices, so their intentions were also dimmed. Buying and selling were both in a state of support, and a formal market is still expected.</p>
<h3>Oil Cake Oil Market Sees Another Rebound</h3>
<p>The oil market has declined for more than ten days since the fall. Although the market price was not violently impacted, the difference was already five or six yuan. Therefore, the general public believes that the foundation will not collapse. Therefore, various groups absorbed quite a bit in the past two days, so the price also returned to the original standard. It is estimated that 100 pieces of Jiaozhou soybean oil were traded, with a price of 66 yuan. 100 pieces of Yanqi soybean oil were traded, with a price of 69 yuan. 300 pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil spot goods and 500 pieces of cargo en route were traded, all at a price of 58 yuan. 150 pieces of Yantai raw oil were also priced at 58 yuan. 60 barrels of Qingdao barrel raw oil were priced at 85 yuan.</p>
<p>Today, 900 bags of soybeans were transported to Hong Kong, and another 2,790 bags were transported to Singapore. 2,000 pieces of bean cake were transported to Hong Kong, and 1,330 bags of raw peanuts were transported to Hong Kong, and another 100 bags were transported to Singapore.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton Yarn Market Has Many Floating Positions, Many Closing at a Loss Shuang Ma Down Over One Yuan</h3>
<p>The yarn market continued to decline, and the downward trend was roundabout. This was because the actual sales were too narrow, coupled with the instability of the situation in eastern Zhejiang, which led to a weakening of public confidence. This situation made many multi-positions uneasy. The floating positions in such an environment were slightly reduced at a loss, but the amount absorbed by the general large households remained unmoved. Therefore, transactions in the market became increasingly quiet, and there was a sense of dispersal.</p>
<p>When the spot yarn market opened in the morning, due to the military tension in Ningbo Zhenhai, most people were suspicious, and buyers lacked interest. The price of 20-count Shuang Ma was 920 yuan, opening slightly more than ten yuan lower. Later, with the encouragement of many parties, it rebounded to 928 yuan. However, the spot yarn business was sparse, and the overall situation was again relaxed. The market price went down again, falling to 917 yuan. At the closing time, the gold price rebounded, pulling up one step to a price of 920 yuan. The statistics for transactions in the half-day totaled 1,370 bales, and the market price referred to Shuang Ma at 21 yuan. Today, 80 pieces of yarn will be shipped to Haikou, and another 940 pieces will be shipped to Hong Kong. The amounts bought by various groups are listed as follows:</p>
<p>Same industry: 1,160 Hong Kong: 210</p>
<p>Total: 1,370</p>
<p>Cotton Market Difficult to Expect Progress</p>
<p>Spot cotton transactions are still ordinary. This is because yarn sales are declining and market prices are falling, so factory appetites are not healthy. However, there are some transactions for delivery, and there are some transactions, but it cannot affect the overall situation, so the market is still lacking in color. In addition, overseas cotton markets are still in a slump, and people's confidence is still difficult to boost. Da Zhong Ji is 190 yuan, with 180 bales traded. American cotton is 260 yuan, with 200 pieces traded.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Customs Gold Increases, Foreign Sugar Follows Up</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market saw a sudden increase in the customs gold unit, which was originally 2.708, but is now changed to 2.877, resulting in an increase of 9 jiao per picul for white sugar tax and 6 jiao for brown sugar, so the trend followed tightly. The guild divided the spot goods into 24 rough whites, with the price in the local stack at 68 yuan to 68 yuan, an increase of one yuan. The price in the foreign stack was initially 66 yuan 9 jiao to 67 yuan, and then rose to 67 yuan 5 jiao to 8 jiao. In the afternoon, it was 66 yuan to 68 yuan 2 jiao, an increase of one yuan and two jiao. As for re-exported goods, because the customs duties were not included, there was not much fluctuation, with the morning price at 52 yuan 9 jiao to 7 jiao 5 fen, and the afternoon price at 53 yuan. Delivery in 30 days was 53 yuan 3 jiao. Taikoo Car White B Mark West Stack was 77 yuan 5 jiao to 78 yuan, an increase of one yuan and five jiao, HX Mark was 75 yuan 5 jiao, an increase of five jiao, and the local factory's snow white was 68 yuan 5 jiao, an increase of one yuan. The local Number One Ice was 90 yuan, and Ming Ice was 91 yuan 5 jiao, an increase of half a yuan. The national factory had Guangbang offering more than a hundred bags of Dongxiang red, at 52 yuan to 52 yuan 5 jiao.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods Demand from Guangdong and Hong Kong is Increasing</h3>
<p>National Cloth: Yesterday's market saw that the coastal areas were blockaded, the situation in Zhenhai was urgent, and sales in Zhejiang were difficult to resume for a while. However, demand from Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Yantai increased, and the market situation was still stable. The selling price of white cloth and bleached fabric was slightly reduced by 2 jiao 5 fen to 5 jiao per bolt. The Yantai merchants purchased nearly 200 pieces of colored cloth and bleached coarse cloth. The Guangdong and Hong Kong merchants purchased more than 300 pieces of coarse cloth, coarse twill, fine twill, and colored cloth. Inland merchants from Ningbo, Wuhu, and other places purchased more than 5,000 pieces and 200 pieces of fine cloth and colored cloth.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: Transactions were sluggish, and the price drop was again pronounced. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth new stack dropped to 28 yuan 4 jiao per piece, while the old stack was only 27 yuan 5 jiao, a decrease of about one yuan per piece. The smallest sale of Four Gentlemen serge opened at 8 jiao 4 and a half fen per yard, and the market atmosphere was very sluggish.</p>
<h3>Abundant White Serge Falling Prices Still Lack Buyers</h3>
<p>The woolen market has continued to be sluggish in recent days. Both local and customer demand is weak. Retail and wholesale transactions are also clear. The mainstream standard market price is clearly stable and secretly loose. The old brand of Abundant blue-edged white serge has fallen quite heavily. If there are actual buyers for the original piece now, the seller is willing to make concessions to sell it off, selling it for only 28 yuan 5 jiao per yard. Retail sales in stores are also sold for no more than 29 yuan and 29 yuan 5 jiao. Based on the delayed arrival at the port, the supply exceeds the demand, and the actual sales are overdue. They are deeply afraid that the price of goods next summer will be difficult to reach the current high. Both buyers and sellers are aware of this, which makes the market atmosphere worse. Although it has fallen by several yuan a yard, there is still no way out.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council's Efforts to Eliminate Political Assassinations; Chairman Urges Leading Consuls to Take Notice; Requests Convening of Consular Body Meeting to Seek Cooperation</h3>
<p>The Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Mr. Keswick, sent a letter to the Danish Consul General and Leading Consul today (20th), which stated in brief: "I am deeply shocked by the sudden assassination of Mr. Zhang Sixu, Director of the Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury, in the Public Concession. Four days ago, the Shen Bao newspaper office was bombed, resulting in one death and multiple injuries. Furthermore, on the evening of the 28th of last month, the president of the Guomin Xinwen [National News] newspaper was assassinated on Fujian Road. Prior to the latter case, the newspaper had received threatening letters stating that if they continued to support certain policies, severe measures would be taken against them. Moreover, it was reported on the 16th of this month that the Nanjing Chinese government had requested seven foreign journalists to leave Shanghai, and Mr. Allman, the publisher of the Shen Bao, was one of them. I have no knowledge as to whether this report is accurate. Furthermore, Mr. Zhang Sixu, who was assassinated, was among the 83 people listed as wanted by the Nanjing Chinese government in the Zhonghua Ribao [China Daily]. While Mr. Zhang's assassination may not be related to the publication of this report, it undoubtedly gives cause for concern.</p>
<p>Shanghai Becoming a Zone of Sacrifice</p>
<p>This Council and its Police Department have been making every effort to suppress terrorist incidents, as you are aware. However, if political factions are allowed to continue committing armed crimes to achieve their goals, the Council and the Police Department will not be able to succeed. This Council expresses its regret for criminal acts, regardless of their method, motive, or perpetrator. In the past, the Public Concession could be considered a place where public order was reasonably maintained, and those in charge were able to find ways to reduce crime and maintain tranquility. However, with the current irreconcilable factions exerting all their efforts to achieve their goals, Shanghai is becoming a zone of sacrifice. In this time of global turmoil, I sincerely hope that Shanghai can become a place where people can live and work in peace.</p>
<p>Request to Convene Consular Body Meeting</p>
<p>I firmly believe that no responsible person can condone the use of assassination as a weapon. As the Chairman of this Council, I cannot remain silent in my position. Therefore, I am writing to you about this regrettable situation and also sending copies of this letter to newspapers for publication. I urge you to convene a meeting of the Consular Body as soon as possible and to encourage all consuls to cooperate with this Council so that these political assassinations, which undermine all confidence and damage Shanghai's international reputation, can be stopped."</p>
<h3>Labor Strike at the British-owned Shanghai Gas Co. Remains Stalled</h3>
<p>The entire workforce at the Yu Qiaqing Road factory of the British-owned Shanghai Gas Co. submitted a request to the company several days ago for improved treatment. This was rejected by the company, and a work slowdown subsequently occurred. The slowdown continued until yesterday. According to an investigation by a reporter from the Pingmin She [Common People's Society], the company's attitude is firm, and it has rejected all of the workers' demands, stating that there is no room for negotiation. The company has given the workers a deadline of 7:00 AM on the 22nd to resume work, otherwise they will be considered to have resigned voluntarily. The labor side is still insisting on its original demands, resulting in a stalemate between the two sides. According to workers speaking to the reporter, the company had increased wages by 7.5% during the coronation of King George VI in 1936. Unexpectedly, the factory stopped paying this wage increase last month. The current demands include a request that the factory resume paying it.</p>
<h3>Filipinos Concerned About Independence Issue; Eagerly Awaiting U.S. Assistance</h3>
<p>Filipino businessman Mr. Areneta arrived in Shanghai yesterday aboard the President Adams. He told reporters that Filipinos are deeply concerned about the fact that national defense will no longer exist when the Tydings–McDuffie Act expires in 1946. However, any proposal to delay full independence must come from the United States. Filipinos previously</p>
<p>Fought for Independence for National Dignity</p>
<p>But today's world situation is different from the past. Aggressor nations are filled with insatiable desires. Therefore, Filipinos are temporarily unwilling to be independent, lest independence be gained and then lost, and they be devoured by aggressor nations. Our pursuit of freedom is not a temporary measure. Therefore, if the U.S. government proposes to</p>
<p>Delay Independence</p>
<p>We will not object. But such a proposal must be made by 1946. If not, Filipinos will be in a difficult position, because Filipinos cannot propose a delay in independence themselves. According to the businessman's prediction, the Tydings-McDuffie Act may not be cancelled at that time, but only</p>
<p>Amended</p>
<p>To give Filipinos full autonomy, but U.S. armed forces will still be stationed in the Philippine Islands. This expedient measure will be beneficial to both the United States and the Philippines. If the Philippines does not have the United States, its national defense will be lost, and if the United States does not have the Philippines, its trade in the Far East will lose its foothold.</p>
<h3>Fifth Column of Japanese Active in Hong Kong</h3>
<p>Passengers who arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong yesterday aboard the President Adams told the reporter that Hong Kong residents fear the activities of the Japanese-led "fifth column" more than a blockade or armed invasion. Japanese troops are gathering around Hong Kong, and if the political situation in the Far East continues to deteriorate, it could easily lead to terrorist acts in the city. The Hong Kong authorities seem to be making considerable preparations for this possible development. Currently, businesses in Hong Kong that are purely engaged in local trade have been hit hard by the evacuation of British women and children and the departure of some Chinese residents.</p>
<h3>Residence of New York Times Reporter Searched by Japanese Yesterday; Two Masked Men Used Weapons to Inflict Abuse; Many Precious Manuscripts Were Taken Away; U.S. Consul to Lodge Protest</h3>
<p>The English-language Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury reported that Mr. A.T. Steele, the Far East Bureau Chief for the New York Times, was brutally beaten by two masked and armed Japanese men in his apartment on the 16th floor of the Broadway Mansions shortly after midnight today (20th). His hands were twisted behind his back by the Japanese, forcing him to open drawers. An unfinished manuscript of a book by Mr. Steele on General Frederick Townsend Ward, the first American to come to China, was taken. This morning, Mr. Steele reported the details of the incident to the U.S. Consulate. According to Mr. Patrick, the Acting Consul General of the United States in Shanghai, he received a letter from Mr. Steele stating that the U.S. Consul will lodge a strong protest with the Japanese authorities regarding this matter. Japanese officials said this morning that they are investigating the attack. Mr. Tsurumi Ken, a spokesman for the Japanese Embassy, who also lives in the Broadway Mansions, responded to the call after Mr. Steele was attacked and went to see him. This morning, Mr. Tsurumi Ken claimed that he was deeply distressed by the matter and that the Japanese authorities have stepped up their investigation. A summary of the incident is as follows:</p>
<p>Dog Barks, Strange Guests Suddenly Arrive</p>
<p>Shortly after midnight, Mr. Steele was in his apartment in the Broadway Mansions, reviewing newspaper articles while in bed, when he suddenly heard his dog barking. Then he heard a knock on the door. Mr. Steele got up to answer the door and saw two Japanese men standing outside in plain clothes, their faces covered with handkerchiefs, each holding a handgun. One was tall and wearing a gray shirt, while the other was short and bow-legged, wearing a dark green top and rather untidy trousers. Each wore a cheap straw hat and rubber tennis shoes.</p>
<p>Telephone Line Forcibly Cut</p>
<p>The two Japanese men burst into Mr. Steele's apartment in the living room, immediately closed the door, and one of them forcibly cut the telephone line on the wall. The other Japanese man kicked Mr. Steele's dog. Both Japanese men spoke fluent English. They asked Mr. Steele for the manuscript of the "anti-Japanese book" he was writing. Mr. Steele replied that he was not engaged in such work. One of the Japanese men pointed a gun at Mr. Steele and ordered him to lead them to his office. Mr. Steele had no choice but to comply.</p>
<p>One Person Watches, The Other Searches for the Manuscript</p>
<p>After turning on the light, the shorter Japanese man watched Mr. Steele, while the other Japanese man searched through the papers on his desk. He found Mr. Steele's nearly completed book manuscript on the life of General Frederick Townsend Ward. Mr. Steele explained that this was a record of historical events, and the person he was writing about had died nearly 80 years ago. However, the taller Japanese man reviewed the manuscript and found that the first page mentioned Japan, with words such as the repeated battles at the mouth of the Yangtze River before 1937. And on the last few pages, he found a record of the destruction of General Ward's tomb in Songjiang by Japanese soldiers.</p>
<p>Accused of Insult, Forced to Kneel</p>
<p>The Japanese man then roared that Mr. Steele was insulting the Japanese army and struck Mr. Steele on the left side of his head, causing Mr. Steele's glasses to fall off. Then he grabbed his left hand, twisted it behind his back, and forced Mr. Steele to kneel. After the two Japanese men spoke to each other in Japanese, they ordered Mr. Steele to show them the "telegram he sent attacking General Miura." Mr. Steele said that if he had sent such a telegram, they could check the draft of the telegram as proof. The two Japanese men then searched again at will, even the boxes in the bedroom were not spared.</p>
<p>Seized the Manuscript and Left</p>
<p>After finding nine short manuscripts, they finally carried them back to the living room along with the original and duplicate manuscripts of the book on General Ward. They warned Mr. Steele that if he called the police within ten minutes, they would shoot him. After saying this, they strode away. Mr. Steele did not hear the elevator go up, so the two Japanese men probably went down the stairs.</p>
<p>Called the Police After a While, No Trace</p>
<p>After a while, Mr. Steele called the police, and everyone in the building knew. But the perpetrators were not caught, because the building has six entrances and exits, and there are many Japanese residents. The two Japanese men may have left the building separately or hid in the apartments of Japanese residents in the building. The two handkerchiefs that covered their faces were abandoned on the stairs.</p>
<p>Nine Months of Effort Will Be Lost</p>
<p>According to Mr. Steele, he had a contract with the New York Duran Company to write a book about General Ward, and he had already received an advance of US$500. He would receive another $500 upon submission of the manuscript. The contract is still in Mr. Steele's safe. The stolen manuscript totaled 354 pages, about 106,000 words. He has been working on the book for nine months. If it cannot be returned, nine months of effort will be lost, or he will have to return the $500 advance.</p>
<p>The Value of Nine Short Manuscripts is Hard to Estimate</p>
<p>Moreover, he has spent more than 800 yuan in legal currency on consulting old books and taking photos for writing this book. As for the value of the nine stolen short manuscripts, it is even more difficult to determine. According to his New York agency, a Hollywood film company is eager to buy the film rights to the book about General Ward.</p>
<h3>The French Tramway Labor Strike Resolved; Workers Resumed Work This Morning; More Than 100 People Returned to the Factory to Work Last Night; The Iron Gates in the French Concession Can Now Be Fully Opened</h3>
<p>The labor strike by 700 coppersmith workers at the French-owned Tramway Company, which had lasted for five days, began to show signs of resolution yesterday morning. From the beginning, the company had maintained contact with the workers in order to find a solution. Yesterday morning, the workers' representatives held another round of negotiations with the company, and the two sides' opinions had become closer. An agreement was about to be reached. Yesterday afternoon, after further mediation by the French Consul General, all the problems were solved smoothly. The workers' representatives were satisfied, and around 100 of the workers had already returned to the factory to resume work by 7:30 PM last night. It is hoped that all 700 members of the mechanical affairs department will return to the factory to work at around 6:00 AM this morning. The work slowdown that had lasted for several days has now come to an end. It was later learned that the police had dispatched two armored vehicles to the front of the company, which had been withdrawn to the police station, leaving only a few patrolmen to guard the perimeter of the company.</p>
<p>The Qiu Xin Labor Strike Has Not Been Resolved</p>
<p>The entire workforce of the French-owned Qiu Xin Machinery and Shipbuilding Factory on Shanghai Army Camp Factory Street in the South City responded in unison to join the strike on the 18th to show their support for the demands of the French-owned water and electricity workers. They also demanded an increase in rice subsidies, as the factory's wages were lower than those of any other factory in the same industry. As of the 20th, the matter had not been resolved. The factory stated that it had increased wages by 40% per month and rice subsidies of 18 yuan per person since June 4th, so it would be difficult to accept the current strike. It posted a notice on the 19th instructing all workers to resume work immediately, otherwise the factory would end its payments to the workers by the end of July.</p>
<p>Work at the Water Plant Was Not Interrupted</p>
<p>The French-owned Water Company on Shanghai Army Camp Factory Street in the South City has a section in its machine room that specializes in drawing water from the Huangpu River to the Lujiawan headquarters, supplying users throughout the French Concession. After the water and electricity workers went on strike, the work in the machine room was taken over by two French engineers. However, starting yesterday, several White Russians were temporarily hired to join the work in order to maintain the supply of important water materials.</p>
<p>Two Iron Gates Were Opened Yesterday Afternoon</p>
<p>Because the opinions of the French Tramway Company and its workers were getting closer, the seriousness of the labor strike gradually decreased. Therefore, the security in the French Concession became more relaxed yesterday. The two iron gates at the intersection of Xin Kaihe Road and Henan South Road were reopened at noon yesterday. Other iron gates remained closed as before, but it was heard that they would all be opened today.</p>
<h3>The Tjitjalengka Ship Will Depart Today</h3>
<p>According to reliable sources in the shipping industry, the Tjitjalengka, a ship owned by the Java-China-Japan Lijn shipping company that sails to Southeast Asia, Java, and Hong Kong, was originally scheduled to depart yesterday after arriving in Shanghai the day before yesterday. However, the departure was postponed due to the strike by the dockworkers who load and unload cargo on the ship. The ship has now been rescheduled to depart today.</p>

<h3>A Man Proposed Marriage to a Woman, but Suddenly Announced the Termination of the Engagement; The Woman Asked the Court to Rule the Engagement Valid; The Judge Instructed Both Parties to Go Outside and Reconcile</h3>
<p>Wang Shuzhen, a 24-year-old woman from Zhenhai, who lives at No. 203 Luban Road and works as a doctor at the Far Eastern Hospital, recently hired lawyers Ge Zhitan and Sun Deji to represent her in filing a lawsuit with the Civil Division of the Second Special Court against her fiancé, Zhang Zuxun (21 years old, local, residing at No. 195, Lane 1218, Route Lafayette, working as a partner at Heyuan Sugar Firm, No. 19 Foreign Firm Street), requesting that the engagement be declared valid. The complaint stated that the woman met the defendant in September of the 25th year of the Republic of China through the introduction of Ying Jinlong. After that,</p>
<p>letters were exchanged and they visited each other from time to time. In the spring of the 26th year of the Republic of China, the defendant expressed his intention to propose marriage. The woman refused, saying that both parties were still young, but the defendant's letters later expressed extreme affection. On the one hand, he entrusted Ye Qingyuan and Ying Jinlong to discuss the matter with the woman's mother. The woman also deeply believed his words, "My admiration for my sister comes from sincerity. My desire to be her lifelong companion also comes from sincerity. How can it be considered passive?" and finally agreed. Therefore, on June 2, in the 26th year of the Republic of China, they</p>
<p>entered into an engagement. On May 27 of this year, she suddenly received a letter from lawyer Yu Bingwen on behalf of the defendant, stating that the engagement was arranged by his parents and was not his own decision, and announcing the termination of the engagement. The engagement in this case was purely the defendant's own decision. Even though the defendant was not yet of age, he had reached the age for engagement, and it was also his own decision, with the consent of his parents. This engagement was legally established and should not be</p>
<p>terminated without reason. The woman hired a lawyer to send a letter of rebuttal, but the defendant dared to misquote Article 975 of the Civil Code and published a notice in the newspaper announcing the termination of the engagement. Whether the engagement can be fulfilled is one matter, and whether it should be terminated is another. They should not be confused. A woman's reputation is important, and it is not easy to remarry. The defendant has other plans and disregards morality, claiming termination out of thin air. How can this be tolerated? Therefore, she filed a lawsuit requesting that</p>
<p>the established engagement be declared valid. Yesterday morning, the court accepted the complaint, and Judge Tan Hao presided over the trial in the Fifth Civil Court. The defendant hired lawyers Li Baosen and Yu Bingwen to</p>
<p>present a defense, saying that the plaintiff had made five demands:</p>
<p>(1) A monthly living allowance of 200 yuan; (2) Not to return to his ancestral home in Pudong; (3) To separate from his parents; (4) Not to interfere with the plaintiff wearing modern clothes; (5) The plaintiff to be in charge of all household affairs. Therefore, he could not accept and requested the termination of the engagement. The plaintiff admitted to making one demand, which was that the current cost of living is extremely high, and the defendant must have a monthly salary of 200 yuan in order to marry. Now that both parties are adults, they requested the court to approve the validity of the engagement. The court immediately advised both parties to go outside and attempt reconciliation, and announced that the hearing would be postponed to the third of next month.</p>

<h3>Deceased Shareholder of Ruichang Hardware Store: Concubine and Legal Wife Involved in Lawsuit; After Qian's Death, All Assets Managed by the Concubine; Legal Wife Sues for Embezzlement and Demands Return</h3>
<p>The late Yong native, Qian Yiying, was a shareholder of Ruichang Hardware Store. During his lifetime, because his legal wife, Chen, only gave birth to one daughter, Ruilan, he adopted Wang, a fellow villager, as his second wife in order to have an heir. She gave birth to one son and two daughters. Later, the legal wife, Chen, passed away, and Qian began an affair with Ren, a fellow villager, at No. 26, 3rd floor, Dali Public, No. 14 Xinyong'an Street. Later, due to the outbreak of the war, Wang and her children</p>
<p>sought refuge in Shanghai from their hometown, temporarily residing at No. 73 Taianli, Beishaxi Road. Unfortunately, Qian passed away from illness in Shanghai on November 12th of last year. All his assets were managed by his concubine, Ren. The legal wife, Wang, and her children requested Ren to divide the assets, but Ren presented a will made by Qian before his death, refusing to hand them over for distribution. Wang, seeing that negotiations were ineffective, hired lawyer Chen Wencan to represent her in filing a lawsuit with the Civil Division of the Second Special Court against Ren, requesting that Qian's</p>
<p>assets be handed over and inventoried, and requesting a judgment ordering that the 1,200 yuan in shares of Ruichang Hardware Store, the 8,900 yuan in deposits at Yudada Heng Sugar Firm, the 600 yuan in deposits at Fei Wenyuan Silver Store, and the 20.5 mu of land and three houses in Longjiang Jjia be handed over for distribution. As a result, Judge Ma ruled that Qian Ren should hand over the inventory of Qian Yiying's assets to Qian Wang. Recently, Qian Wang, in her capacity as legal representative, along with her children Qian Qichang, Qian Xueqin, and Qian Wenxian, again hired lawyer Chen to</p>
<p>file a criminal complaint in the Criminal Court against Ren, Wang Guixiang (accountant at Yudada Heng Sugar Firm, No. 44 Xiaodongmen Road), and Qian Qi (manager of Ruichang Hardware Store, No. 12 Xinyong'an Street) for embezzlement. The court accepted the complaint, and Judge Yuan opened the trial yesterday morning. According to the plaintiffs, the defendant Ren, knowing that Qian Yiying was already 66 years old last year and that he was seriously ill and unlikely to recover, colluded with Wang Guixiang and Qian Qi to concoct an illegal will and withdraw Qian's deposits and shares in Shanghai,</p>
<p>committing embezzlement, violating Article 335-31 of the Criminal Code. They requested that they be punished accordingly and filed a civil lawsuit requesting the return of all Qian's deposits during his lifetime. The defendants hired lawyers Yuan Hanyun, Xiao Baichuan, and Wang Xiuqing to defend them, fiercely disputing the identities of the parties involved and insisting that there was no embezzlement based on the deceased's will, and requested that they be declared not guilty. The court immediately advised both parties to attempt reconciliation and announced that the hearing would be postponed to the 30th. The three defendants each provided a reputable shop as bail, and were allowed to be temporarily released on bail by their defense lawyers.</p>

The judges included female poet Ms. Anderson, Sir Sassoon, journalists, and members of the White Russian Artists Association. A total of eleven young women participated in the competition. As a result, the beautiful White Russian waitress Sudadanko from DD Cafe was elected "Miss Shanghai 1940" with 37,400 votes, winning a gold prize and a large number of flower baskets. Ms. Haberle and Ms. Vaplonoskaja were also selected, each receiving a bouquet of flowers. This type of competition is held once a year and aims to raise funds for charitable purposes. However, only White Russian girls participated in the competition, so it would be more appropriate to call it the "Avenue Joffre Miss Beauty Contest."</p>

<h3>Serious Social Problems: Special Report from Jiang Junsun's Contraception Clinic</h3>
<p>Since the start of the war, this city has become a special area. Although the market is prosperous, its degree is even greater than before the war. However, all are abnormal phenomena, which is different from normal development. Therefore, even if the surface is bustling and remains the same as in previous years, the actual situation of the lives of citizens is that they are almost overwhelmed with pain. In recent months, the international situation has been turbulent. The general situation in Shanghai is even more turbulent, and families who live on monthly salaries are more seriously threatened in this environment. Fortunately, those with few children can barely manage. However, if they have frequent births and many mouths to feed, it will be difficult for them to be parents.</p>
<p>We often see people burdened by their children, running around all day for food and clothing, but still not enough for their lowest standard of living. They have no extra energy to provide education for their children. If children do not have good upbringing, their future harvests can also be known. If it is not remedied, it will affect the future of the nation. Dr. Jiang Junsun, who studied medicine in Germany and has been practicing medicine in Shanghai for nearly twenty years, believes that the above problems are important, so he specially founded a contraception clinic at No. 12, Lane 483, Chengdu Road (phone 36688), to adjust fertility and do his best. Dr. Jiang has sophisticated knowledge and uses G's scientific principles to implement contraception therapy, which is painless, can restore fertility at any time, and has no effect on menstruation or libido. It is indeed the most scientific and economical contraception method in modern times, which greatly benefits the lower middle class. This not only reduces the burden on families, but also allows their existing children to receive considerable education and training, creating a foundation for future happiness. As for the mother, it avoids the depletion of multiple births and maintains health and happiness, the benefits of which are difficult to describe.</p>
<p>It has been shown that the infant mortality rate in this city in the past three years is truly alarming. At the ends of alleys, the corpses of infants abandoned by their parents are often found. Although these tragic phenomena are said to be caused by the environment, they are ultimately a shame to conscience and morality. The only way to prevent it is to control fertility. What other way is there? The reporter feels that Dr. Jiang is able to fundamentally consider the society and the country, so he wrote this article. Those who are burdened by their children should not ignore contraception.</p>

<h3>The Issue of a Third Term for the US President</h3>
<p>"This war is not an ordinary war, but a revolution of force, threatening people everywhere. This revolution does not seek to liberate humanity, but to enslave it… My conscience cannot ignore the call of the people… If the American people call upon me through a free election, I can simply declare that with God's help, I will do my best to continue to serve." This is President Roosevelt's important statement after the Democratic National Convention nominated him as a presidential candidate.</p>
<p>The issue of a third term for the US president has been debated for a long time. Examining American history, the founding father Washington did not oppose a president serving a long term, as generally believed. His successor, Jefferson, the founder of the Democratic Party, firmly opposed a third term for the president, and made Washington's refusal of a third term a convention. Washington secretly opposed including a clause in the US Constitution limiting the number of consecutive terms for the president at the Constitutional Convention. Jefferson, who was in France at the time, argued that the US president should be limited to one term. Other representatives argued that elections should be held every three years, with no restrictions on re-election, while others argued that the president's term should be set at seven years and not be re-elected. In the end, the Constitution stipulated that the president's term was four years, and all proposals to restrict re-election were rejected.</p>
<p>According to another opinion, Washington had no intention of serving as the first president, but he reluctantly did so in order to get the new government on track. He was even less willing to serve a second term, but had to seek re-election due to the international situation at the time. At the end of his eventful second term, he was extremely tired and deeply wished to return to his hometown of Mount Vernon to live a quiet life.</p>
<p>Jefferson's opposition to a second term was even more outspoken than Washington's unwillingness to serve a third term. In a letter to Madison in 1787, he lamented the failure of the Constitution Drafting Committee to stipulate the number of consecutive terms for the president. During his second term as president, eight state legislatures supported him running for a third term. He refused in private letters and declared that the president's term should not exceed eight years. He wrote to the North Carolina legislature: "I am unwilling to be the first to disregard the good example set by the glorious predecessors and seek a third term as president." However, after his retirement, he still held a powerful position behind the scenes in the elections of his successors, Presidents Madison and Monroe.</p>
<p>Since then, the issue of a third term has not become a serious problem. Some presidents even died of overwork before completing their first term. There have also been many proposals to amend the Constitution to limit the number of terms a president can serve. Jackson argued that the president's term should be six years and not be re-elected. However, various amendments have not been established. It was not until the era of Grant, a century after the founding of the country, that the old issue was raised again, but it was only a flash in the pan.</p>
<p>Until the era of Theodore Roosevelt, the issue of a third term for the president arose again. After McKinley was assassinated, Theodore Roosevelt completed the late president's unexpired term and was re-elected once, but he was unwilling to be a candidate for a third term. However, four years later, because he was dissatisfied with the policies of his successor, Taft, he asked the Republican National Convention to nominate him as a candidate. He said: "His previous opposition to a third term referred to serving three consecutive terms." After his request failed, he organized the Progressive Republican Party and ran for election. The three-way presidential election campaign at the time was extremely fierce, resulting in a split in the Republican Party and the election of the Democratic candidate Wilson. However, he received 4,126,020 votes, while Taft received only 3,483,922 votes. Wilson received 6,286,214 votes, more than one million votes less than the Republican Party combined.</p>
<p>Harding died in his first term, and Coolidge succeeded him, completing his first term, and was elected again in 1924 for a second term. After Coolidge was elected to a second term, the issue of a third term arose again. But on August 2, 1917, he declared that he would not be a candidate for president again in 1928. His true intentions were speculated for several months afterward. Most people admitted that he had no intention of running again and that it was the truth. By 1928, the Senate had passed the La Follette Bill by a majority of 56 to 26, calling a third term for the president "an unwise, unpatriotic, and dangerous move."</p>
<p>As for the current issue of President Roosevelt's third term, after he was sworn in for re-election in 1937, the American political world began to discuss what he would do after his term expired. It is difficult to imagine such an active and accomplished figure retiring to the forest and simply ending his days as a "local gentleman of Hyde Park." Over time, the issue of a third term was mentioned, and as the European war changed dramatically, this subtle issue in American history gradually formed a crystallization of public opinion.</p>
<p>However, President Roosevelt himself has always remained silent on this issue over the years, until Senator Barkley read out a 146-word statement on his behalf at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago at 11:18 PM on the 18th of this month. The main point was: "The President has no intention of seeking a third term, or of being nominated as a candidate by this convention, and that is so today as it was in the past. It is hoped that the delegates to this convention will freely nominate any candidate." This open and aboveboard attitude means that if public opinion unanimously supports him through a free election, he will naturally not hesitate to serve the country and the world.</p>
<p>Upon receiving this news, the convention nominated him as a candidate by a very large majority, like being struck by lightning, to oppose the Republican candidate Wilkie. President Roosevelt then directly expressed his acceptance to the convention via radio. This historical issue has thus come to an end, and it can be predicted that when the American people hold a general election in November, Roosevelt will most likely be elected for re-election.</p>
<h3>Ribbentrop and Molotov (End)</h3>
<p>— En</p>
<p>German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop everywhere carries the air of an Englishman. He can be said to be the first British-style German diplomat. Even in terms of physical constitution—tall stature, blond hair and blue eyes, an open face, fit and well-dressed—he could easily pass for an Eton-educated British politician. When speaking, with measured pace and few unnecessary gestures, he possesses the unshakeable and gracefully humble demeanor of the most superior politician at 10 Downing Street in London.</p>
<p>Some describe Ribbentrop as a complete German traveling salesman, but this is only partially correct. He has a knack for fitting into any society, whether it's English, French, or even Russian. He speaks their languages fluently and effortlessly imitates various accents to suit the occasion. As for the number of "tricks" and the brilliance of his conversation, even the gentry and nobility can consider him one of their own. But the talents that make up such a "top-notch" salesman are not German at all. To be precise, Ribbentrop is pieced together from the different manners of various countries; he is a British-style diplomat, mixed with the concise and capable talent of a Parisian hotelier.</p>
<p>Ribbentrop was born in 1893 in a small town in Germany, and his family was middle class. He obtained his noble title through adoption by an uncle who held a prominent position in the army. His early education was not systematic. As a child, he attended schools in Switzerland, French private schools, and British universities. In fact, he never graduated from secondary school or university, and he was quite lax in his studies. However, he is worldly and has a keen understanding. His appearance and ability to cope make it clear at first glance that he is a capable person. The only subject he is proficient in is geography. His understanding of history is only a general outline. On the other hand, he is an expert in business.</p>
<p>Around the age of twenty, he lived in Canada for three years, which had a significant impact on his character. He worked as a foreman in a construction company there, during which time he learned how to deal with subordinates. He is inherently romantic or adventurous. When he received news of the outbreak of World War I in 1914, he became restless and eventually tried all sorts of disguises, and with his proficiency in various languages, he seized the opportunity to return to Germany. But his actual days of combat were very short. Because of his familiarity with the situation in the Americas, he was assigned to the staff headquarters. He was then transferred to the German Embassy in the United States, traveling from Germany by submarine to New York and then to Washington, D.C. His superior was Franz von Papen, the military attaché to Ambassador Bernstorff. Well-informed sources say that Papen's instigation of labor unrest in the United States and Canada was planned behind the scenes by Ribbentrop. In any case, before the United States entered the war, he undoubtedly did or directed many espionage activities. Papen was very satisfied with Ribbentrop's assistance, and even when he was transferred to become the ambassador to Turkey, he asked "Ali" for help.</p>
<p>When the last European war ended, Ribbentrop's espionage work also came to an end. He had no place in the democratic German government. In the years that followed, he did some work to supplement his personal finances. He worked as a salesman for a famous French champagne company, and because of his excellent performance, Hengel, the owner of Germany's largest champagne factory, not only appointed him as the sales director but also made him his son-in-law.</p>
<p>After becoming a wealthy and successful businessman, Ribbentrop wanted to abandon business for politics and join political conspiracies, and became connected with Hitler. At that time, Hitler, although not completely invisible on the German political chessboard, was still a dim horse. But the heir to Hengel's millions did not participate in the Nazi Party's activities at this time. He only tried to get close to Germany's future leader, financially supporting the Nazi Party and maintaining close ties with the core members of the party.</p>
<p>It was Ribbentrop who brought together Papen and Hitler during the coup in January 1932. He also paved the way for Hitler to accept President Hindenburg's order to form a cabinet. He had leaked news to Papen that once Hitler gained power, the position of foreign minister would have to rely on Papen. Months after Hitler took office, Ribbentrop was appointed as a member of the Disarmament Committee, and soon after as the head of the Nazi Party's foreign affairs department. This former champagne salesman completely took control of the Nazi Party's foreign policy and did not take the then nominally German Foreign Minister Neurath seriously. His promise to Papen had "vanished with the wind."</p>
<p>It is now generally accepted that Ribbentrop was the planner of Hitler's policy towards England. When he served as the ambassador to England in 1936, he became very friendly with key figures in British political circles. His first major contribution to diplomacy with England began in the spring of 1938. At that time, he visited London as the dazzling German Foreign Minister, detaining Lord Halifax for two days, so that the Austrian Ambassador to England had no way to contact the British Foreign Minister. During this time, German troops had already entered Austrian territory. Ribbentrop repeatedly discussed German diplomacy with Halifax. When this smokescreen cleared and Halifax regained consciousness, Hitler had become the master of Austria.</p>
<p>Four years ago, one rainy afternoon in London, when the League of Nations Council was judging the issue of the German army reoccupying the Rhineland, Soviet Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov openly turned away from Ribbentrop, who was speaking on behalf of Hitler, and read the newspaper while muttering to himself. Ribbentrop flushed with embarrassment, but after giving this communist opponent a disdainful look, he continued his speech. Ribbentrop kept this incident in mind. Last summer, when he flew to Moscow to sign the Soviet-Russian agreement, he greeted Molotov with a smile, asking about the whereabouts of the retired Soviet Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov, and meaningfully praised that the two of them, Ribbentrop and Molotov, would of course have no difficulty in "now" seeking mutual understanding.</p>
<p>Molotov and Ribbentrop were quite able to understand each other. Molotov once said to Stalin that the Communist Party and sympathizers around the world would certainly agree with the signing of an agreement between the Soviet Union and the Nazi Party, the master of Central Europe. Ribbentrop also assured Hitler that the German-Soviet agreement would prevent Britain from interfering with Germany's invasion of Poland. These two diplomats must have felt that under normal dictatorial circumstances, if either side miscalculated, both sides would be in danger of bankruptcy.</p>
<p>The Hercules-like Soviet Russian Foreign Minister and the handsome salesman of German Nazi foreign policy were clearly not afraid of their bosses. Molotov's office was connected to Stalin's, but newspaper reporters all said that Stalin often went to Molotov's office in person. On the other hand, the German Foreign Minister was the one with whom Hitler "discussed" diplomatic matters yesterday. General Göring often expressed resentment towards the surge in power of this "savage in the Nazi Party." We don't need to speculate on whether Stalin and Hitler were puppets of each other. It would be more intimate and interesting to ask whether the two of them had become the "toys" of Molotov and Ribbentrop.</p>

<p>Ancient Methods of Locust Control (2)</p>
<p>According to records, locusts belong to the category of pests. The Erya Interpretation of Poetry distinguishes between those that eat the heart of seedlings, those that eat leaves, those that eat joints, and those that eat roots. Nowadays, the common people do not have time to distinguish them, and all are called locusts. The customs of the ancients were simple and honest. The odes in the Book of Poetry seem to indicate that the people themselves eliminated them. Therefore, on the day of reporting and paying field rents, they prayed to seek help. It is not heard that the authorities eliminated the harm for the people. The Spring and Autumn Annals record disasters and anomalies, and mentions the moth, but the commentary does not detail methods of catching and eliminating them. In later generations, the thorough taxation method was not implemented, and taxes were levied on the land. Even with minor disasters or crop failures, officials did not report them and continued to collect taxes as usual. Therefore, once farmland suffered harm, the people feared that the authorities would not know, so they rushed to report in droves. Whether it was drought, prolonged rain, river breaches, or hail damage, all were reported in detail. As a result, the disasters that the people should have eliminated themselves became the responsibility that officials dared not refuse. Therefore, they banned slaughter, set up altars, surveyed waterways, and reinforced dikes, laboring tirelessly throughout the year without rest. The most anxiety-inducing and difficult to reverse was locusts. I secretly believe that the ancients acted in a way that could grasp the essentials for planning. After detailed analysis of their intentions, it is known that the ancient method of catching locusts had no other technique than burning with fire. In the early years of the Kaiyuan era, there was drought and locusts in Shandong. Yao Yuancong requested that envoys be dispatched to catch locusts, saying: "I have heard that the poem 'Holding and Giving to the Blazing Fire' in the Great Field is the technique of catching locusts. The ancients did it before, and Your Majesty uses it after. The ancients did it to reassure the farmers; Your Majesty uses it to eliminate the harm." It can be seen that the fire attack strategy has been regarded as the essential method for catching locusts throughout the ages.</p>

<h3>The Process of Salvation</h3>
<p>To explore this issue, it is best to base our understanding on Acts 2:37-42 in the New Testament. Due to space limitations, we will only discuss the key points:</p>
<p>1. Hearing the Gospel—"When they heard this." The so-called "this" refers to how Jesus was crucified by sinners, later resurrected, and ascended to heaven. Everyone! Don't think hearing is easy. Many people don't hear, and some even refuse to hear. It's so pitiful! These people are truly unaware of the danger they are in! Such people are the standard, old-fashioned prisoners of the devil because the devil is afraid that people will hear and believe, so he tries his best to hinder people from hearing the word. Friends! Do you want to break free from the power of darkness? If you are willing, please come, listen, and implement this first line of counterattack.</p>
<p>2. Feeling in the Heart—"They were cut to the heart." This is not salvation, but a preliminary recognition of oneself and sin! However, this experience is also valuable because he has begun to be illuminated by God's light. Friends! Have you ever had this experience?</p>
<p>3. Asking for Guidance—"Brothers, what shall we do?" Being restless and disturbed naturally leads to such a question. Friends! Do you need an answer to this question?</p>
<p>4. Receiving Guidance—"Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit."</p>
<p>5. Accepting in the Heart—"Received his message." The Holy Spirit leads people step by step, like climbing a mountain. Accepting in the heart is like reaching the summit. If you sincerely accept it, you will receive God's promise in John 3:16.</p>

<h3>How to Practice Drawing Economically?</h3>
<p>— Liang Huan</p>
<p>In these extraordinary times, everything is soaring in price. Paper, paint, and drawing tools are several times more expensive than before the war. It seems not easy for us to practice drawing. Many parents may prevent their children from practicing drawing due to economic reasons, which is very regrettable. In fact, if children are determined to do this, they can also come up with various economical methods that can achieve satisfactory results. Now I can offer several methods for children to refer to:</p>
<p>A. Economical Drawing Tools</p>
<p>1. Paper: Commonly used pencil drawing paper is imported and very expensive. We can use domestic alum-treated paper instead. This kind of paper costs about thirty cents per large stack, which is enough. If you can't even buy that, you can use used pencil paper. The clean side can be used for drawing. If it is not clean, you can use thick ink to blacken the entire surface, wait for it to dry, flatten it, and then use white powder to draw. If there is no pencil drawing paper available, you can collect some wrapping kraft paper, wet it with water, flatten it, or stick it on glass, wait for it to dry, and it can also be used as drawing paper.</p>
<p>2. Colors: This is a more difficult problem to solve. Domestically produced cheaper colors, such as the six-color small box from the Marie Factory, also cost six or seven jiao per box; single tubes cost about two jiao each. Western goods are more than ten times more expensive than usual, so there is no need to use them. If you can't even afford domestic goods, you can buy one set together with several classmates and use it in rotation, which is also very convenient. Otherwise, blue and red ink can also be used. If it is difficult to do so, you can use only pencils or ink brushes to create good works. - The popular Chinese ink painting and Western sketching do not use colors.</p>
<p>3. White Powder: This is used when drawing on black or dark-colored paper. In addition to lead powder, shoe polish, facial powder, tooth powder, etc., can be mixed with some glue and used. Adding a little light color to it makes it most clear and beautiful on dark paper.</p>
<p>4. Brushes: Pencils, finely made soft lead, are also very expensive. It doesn't matter if you use the softer pencils that you usually use for writing notes. For brushes, you can wash clean an old medium-sized calligraphy brush and use it. Slate pencils and chalk can be used to practice drawing on slate boards or blackboards, which is relatively the most economical.</p>
<p>5. Eraser: It is best not to use one. If you must use one, you can use a piece of bread instead.</p>
<p>B. Economical Drawing Methods</p>
<p>1. Practice: No matter what you are learning, you should always pay attention to practice if you want to improve. Drawing is no exception, of course. The most valuable way to practice drawing is to sketch from life. Specializing in copying has little effect. (But when learning to draw, you may as well start with copying). The subjects for sketching should mainly be still life, such as stationery, furniture, melons, fruits, vegetables, flowers, etc., which can all be used as sketching materials. Other things, such as sleeping cats and dogs, and younger siblings, can also be used for sketching. As long as you pay attention to practice, no matter what drawing tools you use, no matter indoors or outdoors, practicing for at least fifteen minutes every day will surely result in considerable progress after a summer vacation.</p>
<p>2. Assignments: In addition to practice, if you want to draw a few holiday homework assignments to be submitted to the school, then you can also use readily available paper (no matter the size), using flat washes (ink or white powder are fine), or pencil, ink brush, or add some light colors, to draw the assignments. Before the start of school, choose the best few, paste them on appropriate paper to increase the beauty of the works, and they will become excellent assignments.</p>
<h3>Insects and Bullets (End)</h3>
<p>— Su Ming</p>
<p>During the First World War in Europe, a French aviator published a surprising piece of news in the newspaper. He said that when he was flying his plane at an altitude of 2,000 meters to survey the terrain, and the plane's speed was very fast, he suddenly saw a small thing flying towards his face. He thought it was just a small insect, so he grabbed it with his hand. When he took a look at it, it shocked the aviator. Do you know what it was? He actually caught a small enemy artillery shell. Isn't this an unbelievable and unheard-of joke? In fact, upon careful thought, it's not surprising at all, but a normal thing. Because the speed of an artillery shell cannot maintain the speed it had when it just left the muzzle. Due to the resistance of the air, its flight speed gradually decreases. Eventually, it becomes almost the same as the speed of the aircraft. Thus, the aviator would see the phenomenon of the artillery shell not moving in the air, or flying slightly like a small insect, and he would naturally grab it effortlessly. An artillery shell in this condition can be harmless. But under the opposite circumstances, an apple can also injure people like an artillery shell! One day, a car was driving on the highway as fast as a bird. The farmers by the highway threw apples, watermelons, etc. to the cars flying past them to show their welcome. However, these gifts were regarded as terrible artillery shells by the people in the cars. The apples caused them serious injuries, the watermelon smashed the cylinder, and even shattered the glass! What is this! The reason is easy to understand. The speed of the car was originally very fast, and when combined with the speed of the watermelon and apples being thrown, it became a dangerous and destructive bullet. For example, a car traveling at 1.2 million meters per hour, with a 400,000-gram watermelon as an artillery shell, has the same kinetic energy, which will certainly cause terrible results. This is indeed a real event that happened during a car speed competition held in Russia in 1924."</p>
<h3>Shirley Temple's Autobiography (10) (1)</h3>
<p>After doing my bedtime prayers by the bed, I went to bed, and my mother immediately turned off the lights. Although I was alone in the dark room with my head on the pillow, I couldn't fall asleep for a while, so I recited those lines over and over again. When I woke up the next morning, I was so familiar with them that they flowed out naturally.</p>
<p>However, when I went to school, I constantly remembered those lines, fearing that I would forget them. However, I not only had to remember the lines; I also needed my mother to guide me on how to perform all the actions. You must know that my mother was indeed a very good director. In the films I starred in, my mother always had to put in a lot of effort to guide me first, so when I went to the film set, it saved the directors a lot of effort. Especially rare was that whenever I worked on the film set, my mother never participated, she just watched. But as soon as we got to the bungalow and returned home, she started to get active, tirelessly guiding me in everything. Therefore, Fox Company paid her a large salary, acknowledging that she was my personal director. I once heard my father tell his friends that with the salary he earned from his job at the bank and the salary my mother earned from the film company, they could just buy a new house, give Jack and John higher education, and raise me well. My father also said that all the money I earned would not be used, but would be completely deposited in his bank until I grew up.</p>
<p>The great star Will Rogers often called my mother my manager. One day, my mother and I were eating in the film set's dining room, and Mr. Rogers ran to our table. The old gentleman liked to tell jokes. Pointing to a plate of vegetables I was eating, he kept shaking his head and said, "Huh! How can you eat this rabbit food, while your manager is eating steak! How does that make sense!" At that time, I told him that this was not rabbit food, and that I liked to eat all kinds of vegetables. The only thing I didn't like was onions.</p>

<h3>Is There a Heavenly Father? (1)</h3>
<p>Today, many people say there is no God. They say this because the world is full of injustice and inequality. There are also many people who, although they say there is a God, say that this God is not a good God and does not care about human happiness. Christians not only believe that there is a God, but also believe that God is good and is the Heavenly Father of all mankind.</p>
<p>Now let us study the above three statements to see if what they say is true. Regarding God's qualities, if we say that he is not good, then it is equivalent to saying that he is not God. Because God's existence is related to God's qualities. They either exist together or perish together.</p>
<p>God's goodness is not a new issue. It has been manifested to mankind since the beginning of the world. But why do people think about this issue? And why do they like to discuss this issue? This is because people value morality and goodness, and cherish them above all else. May I ask, where did people's concept of valuing morality and goodness come from? We believe that man was created by God, and people's concept of valuing morality and goodness comes from God, the source of all goodness. People's desire for virtue comes from God, which proves that God himself is good.</p>
<p>Even so, there are many things in the human world that make people doubt God's justice and goodness, and also make many Christians waver in their faith as to whether God is the Heavenly Father of mankind. For the sake of discussion, let's bring up three difficulties: (1) Difficulties in the material world. (2) Difficulties in the animal world. (3) Difficulties in the human world.</p>
<p>(1) Difficulties in the Material World: These difficult questions arise from the suffering personally experienced by humans and animals. This suffering is all caused by natural disasters that humans cannot control—gales, water, fire, earthquakes, landslides, etc.—so humans and animals become helpless victims. For example, the fire and flood disasters in China in 1932 and the Great Kanto Earthquake in Japan in 1923 sacrificed countless lives. When these disasters occur, people will think about whether there is a good God in heaven and earth who cares about his creations? When we raise such questions, we must first remember that our world exists according to certain laws. If these laws stop, we cannot live. The forces that cause rain to fall from the clouds, wind to blow, and fire to burn from the earth all proceed according to these laws, making the world a favorable environment for the survival and prosperity of humans and animals. Sometimes the activities of these forces lead to natural disasters such as storms, floods, or earthquakes, sacrificing many lives. (To be continued on the 23rd)</p>

<h3>Mei Lanfang Has Departed for Manila</h3>
<p>— Hui Cun</p>
<p>Hu Die Also Making Preparations to Go to the Philippines</p>
<p>After the war, Mei Lanfang left Shanghai and lived as a recluse in Hong Kong for nearly three years. In his spare time, he socialized with local friends and entertained himself by painting and raising birds. His life was quite leisurely, and he expressed weariness with his stage career. Therefore, he has grown a beard and does not intend to appear on stage again.</p>
<p>Recently, due to the tense situation in Hong Kong Island, the authorities are actively evacuating the population, and various film companies are planning to relocate. Mr. Mei has no intention of staying in Hong Kong Island any longer. It was once rumored that Mr. Mei would be hired to go to Kunming, but that did not materialize. According to news received from Hong Kong, Mr. Mei departed from Hong Kong by ship on the 5th of this month with his entourage for Manila. It is not yet known whether Mr. Mei will reside there permanently. Furthermore, film star Hu Die is also making preparations to leave Hong Kong. It is said that her destination is also Manila, but the date of departure will depend on when she can purchase a ticket. It is also said that Pan Yousheng will accompany her.</p>
<h3>Zhu Bingxin Secretly Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Taigong</p>
<p>"Mr. Wang" Tang Jie entered Sichuan twice in the past two years, wandering for more than a year before returning to Shanghai to continue filming "Mr. Wang" movies. Four films have now been released. "Painted Phoenix" is a historical "Mr. Wang" film.</p>
<p>Not long ago, this publication carried a piece of news saying that Tang Jie and Zhu Bingxin might rekindle their old relationship. Regarding this, a secret was exclusively obtained by the reporter yesterday: Zhu Bingxin secretly arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong a few days ago. Tang Jie and Zhu Bingxin's union occurred four years ago when the New Era Company announced the cessation of "Mr. Wang," and his screen life could not continue. Just as someone initiated the organization of the "Star Troupe," bringing together song and dance, Peking opera, and drama, to perform in various parts of Southeast Asia, Tang Jie was also one of the mainstays, and Zhu Bingxin was a new member of the song and dance troupe. Before they left Shanghai, Zhu Bingxin, with her passion for screen life, was happy to approach him early on. Before long, the two began living together and had a son and a daughter.</p>
<p>In July of last year, Tang Jie, in a difficult situation, inevitably found it hard to make ends meet. As a result, Han Langen introduced a lawyer to help them dissolve their spousal relationship. This time, Zhu Bingxin secretly came to Shanghai, of course, both parties are very satisfied. Tang Jie is currently busy working for Xinhua, and the remuneration is relatively high, so he is not afraid of another economic panic.</p>
<p>It is now heard that Zhu Bingxin is temporarily staying at a friend's house while waiting for Tang Jie to arrange things properly before reopening their old business. However, whether Zhu Bingxin will dedicate herself to the screen or pursue other work is still undecided. Perhaps everyone will know after a period of time.</p>

<p>— Xia</p>
<p>Hawthorn Detective Case</p>
<h3>The Homecoming of the Dance Queen</h3>
<p>— By Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter 3: Conflicting Information</p>
<p>Hawthorn exhaled a puff of smoke and turned his head to glance at me and Ni Jinshou. Ni Jinshou nodded, seeming to indicate that he understood Hawthorn's hint. I also realized that Wang Lilan's saying "nothing happened" to Old Mao was precisely a footnote to "something happened." She clearly deliberately wanted to send Old Mao away.</p>
<p>Hawthorn then asked Old Mao, "Okay, you continue. What time did you return from the theater last night?"</p>
<p>Old Mao said, "I came back very early, around twelve o'clock I arrived here--"</p>
<p>Hawthorn interrupted, "What? The theater let out that early?"</p>
<p>"No, it was very stuffy last night, and the theater was packed. I sat for less than two hours, and my head started to feel dizzy. Later, the more I watched, the dizzier I became, like I was having heatstroke. Around half-past eleven, I couldn't bear it any longer, so I ran out before the show ended."</p>
<p>Hawthorn nodded. "What happened after that?"</p>
<p>Old Mao said, "After I came back, I swallowed some Wan Jin oil, drank a cup of cold tea, and the dizziness got much better--"</p>
<p>"Wait. When you entered the door, what was the situation in this house?"</p>
<p>As soon as Old Mao heard this sentence, his interest in talking seemed to increase again. He lowered his voice and said, "What I want to tell you about the strange situation is this: I came from the side of Datong Road. Near the corner of Datong Road, there was a black car parked, but there was no one in the car. At the time, I didn't pay attention, so I didn't notice the car's license plate. When I entered the gate, I saw that the lights on the second-floor windows were all off, only the lights in this reception room were still on. It was raining heavily at the time. When I entered the gate, the door was ajar and not locked. After I came in, I gently closed the door as usual and went into my own gatehouse."</p>
<p>"Didn't you lock the gate?"</p>
<p>Old Mao shook his head. "No."</p>
<h3>Mao Shilai's "New Yu Tang Chun"</h3>
<p>— Keyun</p>
<p>After Mao Shilai entered the school of Xun, he was long renowned in the old capital for the play "New Yu Tang Chun," a masterpiece by Weisheng. This time, the Golden Label performed this play, and I went to listen. The sultry heat was oppressive, and I listened to the play while wiping away sweat. After the singing ended, I returned home and wrote this article to fill the pages of this publication.</p>
<p>Shilai's voice is abundant, and his foundation is also good. However, the softness and bonelessness of the Xun style, and the gentle and melodious sound, are not easy to use. Shilai's singing is flat and shows no change. He is very similar to Weisheng in many ways, but he is more outstanding in his broad and bright, "snapping eyes" in rhythm. The achievement of his entire vocal performance is especially superior. Therefore, the inflections are gentle and moving, and every word is pleasing to the ear. Compared to the past, he has indeed made progress. A connoisseur of opera like myself is deeply gratified. The love narrative at Guanwang Temple, with the performance of small movements in the posture of a martial woman, half-pushed, half-accepted, graceful and charming, without appearing vulgar, is something rarely seen in other performers. The solo singing of the "Nan Bangzi" tune in a small building dressing up is intricate, with rapid rhythms, yet the threads are not disordered, and the pronunciation is accurate. He is almost indistinguishable from Weisheng. This harvest, achieved through a lot of practice and refinement, is truly admirable.</p>
<h3>Li Qinian May Arrive in Shanghai This Afternoon —Yi Hua Gives the Title of "Southern Queen of Film"</h3>
<p>The news of the Southern Queen of Film, Li Qinian, coming to Shanghai has been detailed in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that the Dutch postal ship Chizasanica, on which Li is traveling, was originally scheduled to pass through Xiamen first, and only arrive in Shanghai on the 22nd. Now the itinerary has been changed to sail directly to Shanghai. If there is no wind resistance, it will arrive at the port at 3:00 PM today (the 21st). At that time, tens of thousands of people will gather on the Bund, and there will be a lively scene.</p>
<p>It is also reported that Yi Hua's publicity department has decided to expand publicity for Li Qinian, who is known as a "patriotic artist." It is heard that if Li does indeed come to Shanghai on the 21st, she will host celebrities from all walks of life on the 22nd, editors of film magazines and periodicals on the 23rd, and reporters from major newspapers on the evening of the same day, and will use "Southern Queen of Film" as a promotional title.</p>
