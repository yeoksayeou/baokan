<p>社評</p>
<h3>國際局勢發展的新階段</h3>
<p>德義日締結同盟、這幾天來全世界的輿論和反響。似乎絲毫沒有引起什骨驚異和惶恐，因之，三國簽訂這同盟的企圖，至少已經有一部份，首先宣吿了失敗。相反的，從此以後，在對方的國際營壘裏，對於這三國的關係，再也不會有紛岐的議論，統一而且加强了應付的步伐；使他們乘隙而入，各個擊破的可能，從此完全消失。這在一般還有兩憎欵問：第一，既然這三國同盟關係，是一直非正式存在着的，那末，為什骨去年德國對波宣戰的前夜，却忽然與蘇聯簽訂了互不侵犯協定，自認拋棄了日本的同盟？還有第二，既然表面放棄對日同盟關係，已經一年多了，為什麽現在又使他凝固且又以威脅的姿態，出現在全世界的面前，要知道：三國的關係，完全是一貫的，去年的德國舉措，不過是麻醉蘇聯的手段，現在的舉措呢！却是企圖嚇退美國的手段。究其終極，牠們無非企圖由合作而造成所謂「歐洲新秩序」及「大東亞新秩序」；赤裸裸的說就是瓜分世界！</p>
<p>由三國的企圖，以迄盟約的簽訂，使國際形勢為之淸朗，而確立了一個新的分野標凖：凡是在立塲上，與所謂歐亞兩個「新秩序」牴觸或反對的，皆是德義日三國的共同敵人，因此，今後一切其他國家的對外關係，亦確立了一個共同方針。</p>
<p>先說英國吧。今後的英倫三島，只德義「歐洲新秩序」的對象之一；英帝國在亞洲的廣大利益，則是日本「大東亞新秩序」的對象之一；再以牠是整個帝國維護凡爾賽和約後世界現狀的立而論，牠是牠們瓜分的最大對象：總之，英國與德義日三國，到處站在敵對的地位，定全失去了調和的餘地。在以前，英國對歐亞兩方要的根本原則，是分別看待應付的。像去年四月開始的英蘇合作談判中，一開始，英國就反對功外部包括遠東在內的提議，致使初期的談判，完全歸於失敗。而後來一到七月，為了應付當時歐洲危機的加重，張伯倫首相領導下的英政府，甚至簽訂了「東京協定」。去年九月，英國對德宣戰以來，這種政策，尤其表現得露骨，到最後，就出現了今年七月對滇緬公路的封鎖。英國在這次歐戰裏所打的旗幟，是反對强權政治，可是我們却很少聽到有人主張把這原則，普遍地應用到遠東。他們對遠東一貫的空話，是所謂「希望中日間及早恢復和平，嗈有可能，英政府願意貢獻其服務。」而是近這幾個月來。英國對阻止日本與德義接近的企圖，尤其竭盡了心力。可是結果，這一切都完全徒勞了，德義日正式簽訂了同盟！從今而後，英國不獨在歐洲是被侵略國；即在亞洲方面，牠完全和中國一樣，是站在被侵略國的地位。那末，她近年所奉行的歐亞分別看待和應付的政策，將勢必完全加以放棄。</p>
<p>其次，說到美國。這一次三國同盟的第三條，明明白白的已經把美國當為牠們共同的最大敵人，搆成了使這次盟約正式宣佈的主要因素。當然，這一步驟的眼前效騐，不能說是沒有；牠首先阻止了美國對日本侵入越南的干涉。假如不是這個盟約的宣佈，那末，美國大概是會加以相當壓力，逼日本屈服的；現在根本局勢起了變化，當然已經成為過去。然而，再朝遙遠和廣大的領域上眺望一下，美國整個對外政策所受的影響，比起當前的越南問題來，還要大到無數倍。從此以後，美國一般對大西洋防務或太平洋防務君子坦蕩蕩一面重要的辯論，當然也成了過去，兩洋海軍派主張的正確，完全被證實了。而最根本的一點，美　國一般置身國際舞台以外，幫忙別人的心理，現在可算受了一個致命的打擊！雖然里本特洛甫說。美國也可以在美洲造新秩序，但美國是不會再受催眠的。因此，最近除了宣佈對中國二千五百萬美元的借款外，已經有人在呼叫着：美國今後的第一道防綫，歐洲方面，在英國，遠東方面，則在中國！所謂僅僅防衛西半球，不牽入任何其他戰爭的理論，都失去了根據。</p>
<p>三國盟約裏最幽默的，是以與蘇聯關係為對象的規定。據說，三國對於蘇聯的關係，不受這次同盟影響。很顯然，這是對蘇聯的另一服催眠劑。縱使德·義·日拋棄原來所謂「反共」的立塲，可是，也就和美國一樣，在東西兩面的三國同盟的情形下，蘇聯的安全，已經受到了根本的威脅！牠絕不能長此孤立下去。今後蘇聯的對外工作尋求與國成了第一義，至於分別緩和與德義日間的衝突，已經成為次要的了。在這了方向下，加强援助中國是必然的；而且，這幾年來為提防樹立許多敵國對自己一致進攻，而號召著的所謂「和平外交」，從此也從他的本質上失去了繼續的論據。</p>
<p>最後，中國對於這一同盟的態度，已經由王外長前天的談話，予以極點明的答覆：「中國政府與人民，決定繼續為世界合法之秩序努力奮鬥。」這是中國對外關係的原則。至於實際一切的舉措，當然要按照將來環境，有待隨時予以考慮。這與「除日本侵略者外均為中國友人」的態度，顯然亦有了重行考慮的餘地。</p>

<h3>美國備戰槪况</h3>
<p>— 譯紐約泰晤士報</p>
<p>美國現正進行上决大戰以來第一决的龐大擴軍計劃。五月十六日那天，德國以泰山壓卵之勢進襲法比兩國，羅斯福總統出席國會，警吿國人，謂「美國必須保衛西半球，不使其受他國的控制，侵略與支配，」並向國會請求撥付一·一八二·〇〇〇·〇〇〇美元，以爲加强國防之用。迨德國在各地獲得勝利以後，羅斯福總統又於五月三十一日咨文國會，請求軍費，到了七月十日，羅斯福總統視德國的勝利，「乃民主政治最大的危險」，而國會第三决請求數目龐大的國防經費。這項特別經費，加上一九　一年財政年度的經常國防費，其總數已達平時回所未有的一百萬萬美元之多。</p>
<p>除此以外，國會父通過一議案，授權總統，建造兩洋海軍，使美國海軍的實力，幾超過以前一倍，佔計費用，又需一百萬萬美元。</p>
<p>因此，自今年一月一日以來，國防經費總數達二百萬萬美元的驚人數目，其中大部分可以在五月十六日以後動用。羅斯福總統開始請求特別經費進行美國空前國防計劃之時，美幽海陸軍也都已在進行現代化及强化工作了。</p>
<p>美國現有海軍，已屬世界强大無敵，只有英國海軍，在噸數上超過美國，但在實際作　能力上，美國也卉超過英國。美國陸軍人數較他國爲少（軍官與士兵共二十四萬二千），訓練及配備也都不良，但美國陸軍的改組及現代武器却可立卽準備。美國的空軍亦相形見絀，海軍只有一千七百六十五架，陸軍只有飛機二千八百架。</p>
<p>至於海陸軍飛機塲業已在建造中，美國本部大陸及其海上屬島間連絡綫也頗多增進。趕造現代軍器計劃早在進行，羅斯福總統五月十六日出席國會時，業已有三英寸口徑高射砲四百四十八架，斯必林飛爾式步槍一百萬枝以上，半自動步槍三萬八千枝，三十厘口徑子彈一千匕百萬發，防毒面具叫十萬零七千隻。</p>
<p>但在五月十六日以前，美國並非毫無準備，也海陸軍界爲德國勝利所震驚，認爲該項勝利，足以影響美國，不得不有未雨綢繆之計。美國在陸空兩方面的設備，並無德國那樣的力量，並且德國如有機會，攫取了英國　隊及歐洲的造船廠，足以使目前的海軍失去均勢，再與日木或義大利聯合，史足以在海上占有不可侮的力量。</p>
<p>故從戰鬥力木身及國外事件兩項觀之，美國實有加　行駛的必要。這就是美國突然要求有史大國防力量，更多的兵艦，更多的飛機，更多的槍砲與史多的士兵的原因。而國防計劃，也在繼續不斷的變化，遂漸使其合理化，成爲一個有系統的精密組織。如果過去是計劃時期，則以後卽爲實行時期。就目前的成就講，已有下列幾項：</p>
<p>（一）五十萬萬美元以上的國防費業已指定，目前已可動用，另五十萬萬美元的經費，也已交付國會通過；增加艦隊噸位百分之七十，也已通過實行</p>
<p>（二）海陸軍已改變以前國防計劃，卽可擬定基本國防計釗，動用國防基金。</p>
<p>（三）爲援助軍火製迭及防止怠工起見，羅斯福總統已設立國防噸問委員會，總統自任主席，而以實業界巨頭克納遜及期脫鐵尼斯爲委員。</p>
<p>美國的國防計劃在求應付一切，故海陸軍國防基本政策究屬如何，尙難斷言。西半球的防衛自爲最顯明目標之一，但西半球防衛的必要條件，必須獲得美國本土及海外領土以外的根據地。租借南美根據的接洽已在暗中進行，但實際獲得特里尼達及加拉柏高斯島的租借權，尙未實現。（譯者注，該兩島現已由英國租與美國。）</p>
<p>其他軍事計劃，至目前爲止，可得而言者，的爲海陸軍兩方面。</p>
<p>就海軍方面言：（一）一九四六年至一九四九年，海軍艦隊噸位，比之現在，應增加百分之七十，例如戰鬥艦應由現有十五艘，增至三十五艘。</p>
<p>（二）至一九四六年，海軍員額應用目前之十四萬五千人，增至四十萬人，在本財政年度，卽應增至一十九萬人，一九四二年財政年度，則應增至二十一萬五千人，或二十六萬人。</p>
<p>（三）預定在一九四二年六月前後，完成　國本部及其領土內海軍根據地及其設備與空軍根據地，並增加造艦設備。</p>
<p>（四）至一九四六年百分之七十海軍噸位完成時，須將目前海軍飛機二千架增至一寓三千五百架。至一九四二年四月，海軍飛機卽應由七千架，增至八千架。</p>
<p>美國擴充備各種情形</p>
<p>就陸軍方面言：（一）本年九月，美國正規軍增加至三十七萬五千人。動昌國防軍，今年可召集者只有四師。在目前國防軍實力，的有軍官及士兵二百四十萬人。九月一日實微兵，新兵每名月餉定爲一十一美元，訓練至少需十五個月，使國防軍及陸軍能達一百二十萬人或至二百萬人。</p>
<p>（二）至一九四二年四月，陸軍飛機由目前之三千架，增加至三萬六千五百架。</p>
<p>（三）由一九三一年十月起至一九三二年六月止，使美國陸軍一百二十萬人，完全配備現代武裝，同時使其他八十萬人，得配備各項主要武器。</p>
<p>（四）至一九四二年四月，編成現代機械化專門部隊。</p>
<p>再就國內軍事建設方面：（二）至一九四　年四月，須將國內飛機生產工業增加生產量五六倍以上，卽由目前之每月製造飛機七百架及引擎一千四百具，增至每年製造飛機四萬架及引擎十萬具。換句話說，使海陸軍最後可有飛機五萬架。</p>
<p>（二）由政府津貼或援助，或由私人投資，在八個月或十五月以內，建造大批火藥廠，製造局，以爲大量生產軍火之用。</p>
<p>（三）建造大批堆棧，以爲貯藏軍需原料之用。</p>
<p>（四）組成國內防衛部隊，高射砲部隊及其他部隊。</p>
<p>（五）在不妨碍國民經濟生活條件之下，儘先完成此項任務</p>
<p>就製造軍火及加緊工廠生產兩項言之，現在還以限於少數基金可以動用，作爲建設軍備計劃。海軍部自一九三一年度基金中提出一部分，與飛機廠訂立合同，建造飛機一千二百架。陸軍飛機之定造，雖尙未另訂立合同，但在製造中的已値六千萬至六千六白萬美元，同時還有價値一萬八千三百萬美元的軍火材料也在準備中。其他規模宏大的軍火製造合作，規定六個月，八個月，十個月或十五個月以後交貨的，也都在七月中辦理完畢，至本年秋季以前都可就緒。</p>
<p>克尼遜委員會雖則設立未久，却已定造軍備十萬萬美元。幾項嚴重的工業問題，也已設法解除了。</p>

<h3>歐戰叢談（十）（五）　德國的新軍事學</h3>
<p>在德軍進攻的前夕，波蘭國土廣逾十五寓方哩，人口的二千五百萬。大部分的波蘭人雖都窮困，却很愛國，並且在過去，他們也有若軍國民的風尙。所不幸的，他們人口中，非波蘭種人佔百分之四十左右，操俄羅期方言的農民，的佔百分之三十，都在東部各省，耕耘波蘭官吏及地中的田。彼此之間，由於歷史文化及信仰的不同，一方是信天主敎，另一方是信希臘正敎，無形中有了一道鴻溝存在着。還有百分之五是猶太人，另有百分之五是日耳曼人。</p>
<p>波蘭軍隊在歐洲各國中，占着第四或第五位。就大體上講，他們係屬一九一四年至一九一八年代的舊式軍隊，附加着大批騎兵而已。全部有步兵三十師，騎兵十二旅，及機械化部隊一旅。空軍極爲薄弱。兵士及下級軍官都很優秀，高級將領如何就很難說了。</p>
<p>在地理上，波蘭很難防守。從南部的喀爾巴阡山起，到北部的波羅的海止，全境一片平原，其中重要的軍事屏障，只有幾條河流。德國及其小同盟國斯洛伐克的邊界與波蘭邊界的四分之三毘連，形成大牛圓形的包圍綫。波蘭軍事當局却集中五上萬大軍，在這地理不利的西部邊境佈防。其目標苟非希望擊潰大部分德軍，卽是希望英法會在西綫進攻，至少英法會派造飛被赴波助戰。</p>
<p>德軍的計劃是在西錢取守勢，以十一師兵力，及較少的後備兵，嚴守齊格斐防錢。在東錢，集中五十師正規軍，及十師後備兵，其總數計達一百萬人，用以進攻波蘭。德軍全部力量殆集中南北爾翼。其中路只有極少數軍隊，推斷波蘭軍是無暇向中路攻擊的。德軍裝甲師最初都是作後備之用。</p>
<p>一九三九年九月一日拂曉，德國陸空兩軍，不經宣戰，卽突然進攻。據各方報吿，各種作戰的飛機在二千架以上。凡爲德方所偵祭淸楚的飛機塲及飛機廠都遭轟炸。波蘭多數飛機在地上未及起飛，卽被炸毀。兩天以內，波蘭全部空軍卽喪失戰鬥力。德國飛機於是轉而轟炸波蘭鐵路，最後轟炸波蘭軍隊。</p>
<p>同時？德國陸軍向前進展甚速。在最初四日，波蘭北部「甬道」地帶的南端已被德軍切斷。在南部，上西萊西亞省工業區域也被德軍以鉗形攻勢，不發一彈加以佔領。在華沙的西南，波蘭軍逐漸退却，陣錢開始被德軍突破，德軍驚人的機械化部隊隨之跟進，初試　鋒。九月七八兩日，德軍强大的機械化部隊，沿着波蘭僅存的一條完好公路，向東北衝鋒達八十英里之遠，直達華沙近郊。德軍如能守住此種狹長的突出點，波軍中路主力，差不多占波軍戰鬬部隊的半數，這時還在極西靠近德國邊境一帶，勢將陷於絕境，而有全軍被俘的危險。其空通錢已被切斷，除非衝破後方如魔術一樣突然建立起來的德軍陣綫，殆無安全撤退的辦法。同時華沙北面的波軍沿着那魯河佈防，幾度擊退德國進攻　，也終於被突破了。</p>
<p>後來波蘭中路軍，企圖衝破德軍陣錢，戰爭之激烈，爲全部戰役中所未有。有一時期，德軍某一陣地處境甚危，但德軍陣錢雖被迫後退，却沒有被衝破。德軍旋藉大批空軍集中轟炸及由運輸車多輛運到大批援軍，阻止波軍東進，戰至九月二十日那天，被包圍的波蘭中路軍，人數達十七萬人，配備着三百尊大砲，四十輛坦克，不得不向德軍投降。</p>
<p>在華沙西面戰爭終了以前，第二路德國機械化部隊，同時向更南進展，同樣獲得可驚的戰果。這第二路機械化部隊，向前突進達一百英里之遠，把克拉哥城東北及維斯杜拉河西岸利薩哥拉山中的大批波軍切斷聯絡，使其不能退走，以待德國步兵到來，予以解決。到了九月十三日，這處的波軍官兵六萬員名，及大砲一百四十三尊，坦克車三十八輛，也向德軍投降了。</p>
<p>最後，德軍極左翼於九月七日渡過那魯河之後，即在九月十二日那天，以其機械化部隊南進一百餘辱里，而抵白勒斯脫—黎托夫斯克城，旋在十四日黃昏，佔領該城的舊砲台。同日，德軍南路卽極右翼的機械化部隊，三面包圍林堡城。三天之後，德國裝甲車及機器脚踏車隊，自林堡向北突進一百五十英里左右，卽在白勒斯脫—黎托夫斯克南的五十英里處，與南淮的機械化部隊相聯接。</p>
<p>波蘭戰爭到了這個階段，實際上已吿終了。蘇聯軍隊卽自東部開入，並未遭遇波軍有組織的抵抗。華沙軍民的英勇抵抗，只不過將戰事殘局，多延長幾天而已。</p>
<p>講到兩方兵力的損失，據德方宣　，波軍被存者七十五萬人，德軍陣亡者一萬人，受傷者三萬人，不知下落者三千人。卽使此項數目，像其他德國公報一樣，是出於僞造，但無論如何，去年九月的閃電戰，德軍流血之少，那是毫無疑義的事。</p>
<p>挪威戰役卽係德軍新戰術第二個出色的實騐。挪威的情形，與波蘭絕不相同，但德軍將領利用閃電戰的同一原則，應付當前問題，獲得了第二决驚人成功。</p>
<p>挪威是沿海鳥道崎嶇的多山地帶，人口極稀少。幾世紀以來沒有發生過重大戰事。挪威軍隊不過與訓練不良的民團一樣，大部分的人民，雖以勇敢的水手聞名於世，但缺乏戰鬬精神。在他方面，該國通海，可從英法獲得援助。</p>
<p>正如波蘭戰役一樣，德軍進攻挪威，起初也出以陰謀。第一决總攻是在四月九日，由飛機，軍艦，運輸艦，及乘着商船偷入挪威海口的兵士，聯合進行，一夜之間，挪威首都奧斯洛，主要海港，飛機塲，及挪威陸軍六師中的五師總部，都被德軍佔領。德國最初開往挪威的軍隊爲數很少。一星期後，據美國官方佔計，德軍額員也不過一萬八千人，其中半數駐在奧斯洛，其他分散於各地，成爲小隊的孤立軍隊，除空軍接濟外，彼此完全失去聯絡。可是挪威的抵抗力極薄弱，結果少數德軍終使全國渙散，僅有那維克一港是例外。據聞曾有少數德軍乘着四輛運輸汽車，深入挪威內地，追補挪威年邁國王，幸賴若干農民用貨車阻塞公路，挪王始免於難。大部分挪威後備兵，並未應募入伍。本來炸毀道路橋樑足以阻碍德軍陸上行動，但挪威人並沒有怎樣實行破壞。在挪威中部登陸的少數央法軍，曾派兵深入該國一百英里，可是德方猛烈轟炸的空軍和包抄的機械化部隊，上下夾攻，正如在波蘭平原上一樣迅速。結果，英法聯軍祇有退回軍艦。由各地情形觀之，德國空中運輸機，都指揮得井井有條</p>
<p>進攻斯干的那維亞半島一月之後，德軍又大舉進攻荷蘭比利時及法國北部，這是德國第三决的實行閃電戰。</p>
<p>此决戰爭的詳情雖尙不得而知，但覆按地圖，探索德軍每一進展的階段，又可證明德國新戰術足以適應每一特殊形勢。在進攻後第五天，荷蘭軍隊投降了。到了第十二天，德軍已越過比利時的大部分，乘勝開進法國。</p>
<p>此决戰役中，以簇新姿態出現的，卽爲利用降洛傘部隊。比利時的飛機，據說在米起飛以前，就像波蘭空軍一樣，全部　　機炸毀了。</p>
<p>由上所述，我們可以推得兩個結論。第一，德軍在技術上並不是一個超人，不過很能勝仟而已。德國陸軍始終保持普魯士善戰的精神。普魯士人又能個個盡犧牲的責仟，其責任心遠非他國可及。</p>
<p>其决，德軍已絕對證明新戰術的精義，不僅在於使用新兵器，而且在訓練精兵，允其在養成幹練的將領去使用新兵器。德軍成功的秘訣，就在於此。（完）</p>

<h3>中美新借款成立後　美購鉅額鎢砂　鎢鑛產地已經實行統制　運輸路綫亦已計劃妥當</h3>
<p>鎢爲國防上及工業上必需之原料、世界礦藏甚少、產地不過數處、中國鎢鑛儲量得天獨厚、在世界鎢鑛市塲佔重要地位、向以輸往美國爲最多、自中美新借款二千五百萬　元成立後、向中國資源委員會購買價値三千萬美元之鎢、以備美國國防上之需要、聞中國政府正設法解決運輸上之困難、實行統制鎢鑛產地、設立鎢業管理處、以促進鎢砂對外貿易、</p>
<p>中國鎢鑛　得天獨厚</p>
<p>中國鎢鑛、最早發現於河北之撫寗遷安兩縣、迨至民國四年、江西·湖南·廣東、始有鎢鑛之發現、嗣後逐年開採、而以該三省產量爲最多、决爲廣西·福建·雲南·貴州·河北·等省、全國鎢鑛儲量、尙無精確之統計、但據資源委員會民國一十二年之佔計、江西七七九·三三四噸、湖南二一·四〇〇噸、廣東一四八·八五五噸、惟二十二年後、各省均有新鎢曠發現、儲量相當可觀、故中國鎢鑛究有若干藏量、尙不可知、</p>
<p>唯一大王　顧爲美國</p>
<p>鎢砂之出口、一九二八年爲七三·六二九公組、　九三二年降爲二〇·七六五公担、至一九三六年增爲七〇·叫九九公担、戰後一九三八年一二三·五七七公担、價値五〇·四九二·〇八七元、一九三九年一〇六·八九一公担、價値四四·六七四·九一二元、一九四〇年一月至七月二七·七三七公担、價値一二·七三一·七六五元、鎢之輸出爲美國與香港兩處、惟輸　之鎢、係轉口裝輪運美、所以中國唯一之大主顧則爲美國、</p>
<p>統制管理　設選鎢廠</p>
<p>資源委員會爲增加生產、改進鎢業起見、實行統制管理鎢業·於湖南·廣東·江西·各產地、設立鎢業管理處、規定各省所產之鎢砂、均由各省鎢業管理處給價收買、統一輸出、商人米經核准、不得運輸出省、鎢砂收買價格、由各處公佈之、所有中央及地方鎢砂捐稅、仍歸商人按照原額繳納同時對各鎢鑛、予以技術上之指導及協助、並鑒於過去選鎢之手續陳舊、外商購買時極感不便、已設立選鎢廠、改良選鎢、以合外銷、</p>
<p>運輸路綫　計劃妥當</p>
<p>關於鎢砂之輸往美國、以前集中廣州、運香港轉口、後改爲集中海防轉口、現滇越路交通中斷、滇緬路暫行封鎖、今資源委員會正設法解決運輸上之困難、由某國際新路綫運美、惟因路長、太不合算、故決俟十月十七日正式開放滇緬路後、再改由滇緬公路集中某地出口、屆時由美國開航船隻、專載中國鎢砂運美、路錢嚴守秘密、</p>
<h3>葡僑民團體　四大慶祝</h3>

<h3>日本推行新秩序　民衆陽奉陰違　酣嬉放蕩浪費一切如故　推行嚴肅生活徒增愁歎　某外人游日本抵滬後所談之印象</h3>

<p>入夜、藝妓仍頗活躍、周旋於游客之間、然藝妓所衣色澤艷麗之和服、現已改爲「更符時代」之簡單服裝、酒肆與妓院之營業時間、雖已大减、但繁盛如常、致此等塲所之交通、擁擠至極、男女當衆撫抱接吻、雖經明令禁止、仍有所見、祇避警察與便衣探員之耳目、</p>

<p>大街通衢上、時見一精動員聯盟之會員、服樸質、爲衆樹良好榜樣、而「使各大都市街道中產生有益世風之氣氛、」彼等見路人衣服都麗者、不問男女、均攔路規戒、而燙髪點　之婦女、亦遭沿路　勸、故酒肆婦侍之靑絲尙有曲痕者、白畫深居簡出、以免受　、」</p>
<p>追隨女郎　輒遭拘捕</p>
<p>每至午夜九時、甚至七八時、街頭卽形沉寂、行人寥寥、此乃當局不欲民衆閒蕩「派出便衣精神動員」人員沿途觀察行人態度行止、見其顯無目的者、卽加盤問、有以致之、靑年沿途追隨單身女郞者、恒遭拘捕、痛受訓斥或監禁一宵、始予釋放、以儆效允、</p>
<p>車夫貪賞　照常迎送</p>
<p>當局對於娛樂　所游客如雲、世風不振深感不滿、爲盡可能範團使娛樂業衰頽起見、遂警吿出租汽車、不得載客赴任何娛樂塲所、惟此等條規、實皆陽奉陰違游客賞金稍豐、汽車夫莫不樂於接送、故娛樂塲所仍顧客盈門、</p>
<p>物價規定　等於具文</p>
<p>苟就當局新頒之條例推想、商業受其限制、必吿停頓、實則商人現致力於暗中交易、營業僅較平時稍遜、然商人對於經商之不易、已嘖有煩言矣、官方發表日本一般物價水準尙低、殊不知照官方發表之價格、絕難購得貨物、日當局近實行限定物價運動、價格大受削减之貨物、什九絕跡於市、販賣者寗以缺貨爲言、而不願照官定價格出售、民衆洞悉其隱、出高於限定之代價、始能向熟識之商人購得少許貨物、</p>

<h3>律師徐紫峯家　僕役串通竊盜　女傭車夫等併予拘押候判</h3>

<h3>秋風秋雨中底一日</h3>
<p>— 歐陽少華</p>
<p>一夜風雨，使電車公共汽車復工後的行的問題又發生了阻碍，馬路、里弄、甚至地勢過低區域內的住宅，都浸在一片在洋的大水中；人們雖然有過去年「秋汎泛濫」的經騐，然而隨着時間的消長，已是昨日今朝大不同了。譬如從後門口喚一輛黃包車擺渡到馬路上，黃包車夫曾嘻開嘴謝謝：你隨手付與的車資，不論五分或一角；而現在，赤着腿在弄口喚車子如娘姨至少要和十個以上的車夫交涉，甚至竟是口角；—爲了車夫望天討價；或者是回答的口吻竟超過了她主人的盛氣凌人；在一家烟兌店門前（吿訴你，我也在等候黃包車呢）我就聽見了他們的口角。那個車夫不但警吿她米已經要賣八十元一擔，還敎訓她坐不起黃包車就得赤着兩條腿子趕路；接着來了個實地表演，從水中提起濕淋淋的腿來向那娘姨掃去，表示趕路的樣子，可是娘姨的面上身上被撤上了兩點更大的水漬，於是駡了，—車夫却昂着頭去迎候對而招呼的主顧去了。</p>
<p>在每一處等雨，不，等車子的地方、小集團裏，談話的問題總是：從電車罷工談到天老爺，而看到汽車像小汽艇那樣在面前駛過時，羨慕與怨恨之色交輝：羨慕的都感到自己「出無車」；怨恨的是車後的浪花以爲這人羣是岸堤，冲激而至。</p>
<p>忽然有人福至心靈，提出罷工聲中某報建議的「私人汽車搭客」問題，當然沒有人反對，完全通過，而且「誠心則靈」，一輛黑牌子汽車果然緩緩地開到這羣人的身旁停住了，自家開車的車主人立卽跳下車來向衆人招招手。這時候你或許要懷疑這輛老爺車子是吾坐得下這末多的人，哼！用不到你杞人憂天！車主人在下請客柬了：</p>
<p>「來！兩毛錢一個人，把我的車子推到前面一條馬路。」</p>
<p>原來是老爺汽車浸水！</p>
<p>這裏我且大胆下一個結論，我們的「天之驕子」是赤脚人！</p>
<p>黃包車夫自然是坐首席，就是在水中「打野鷄」的也不要小覷了他們：推老爺車還是外快，他們的「正當營業」是「掮客」從弄堂裏「掮」到黃包車上定價二角，從先施公司「掮」到永安公司定價一角，不論你是「洋裝少年」或是「摩登小姐」，一律現付，不折不扣。第三等輪到自己赤脚趕路，旣不受車夫的敎訓，更凶爲馬路上大水保險，可以橫衝直撞，無身入「虎口」的危險。</p>
<p>由於「行」的阻碍就影響了全市的一切。</p>
<p>先從都市的心臟南京路說起罷。「秋季大减價」的旗幟祇遺留着殘缺的布條，無錢電的喇叭放着潮啞的歌聲，有一座彩布牌樓的竹竿上流着紅色的水漬，彷彿蚯蚓爬着一樣，把顧客都嚇走了。雖然幾家百貨公司里還是「門庭若市」，不過這「市」也僅「若」而已，—他們是來避雨的，騙去了眼睛和鼻管的享受，却沒有入買一枚巧格力糖。</p>
<p>有一家綢緞店的出店拿着拖糞巴在揩拭店堂里的水漬，但後面擁進的「顧客」叉帶來了新的「禮物」。這許多「看的顧客中祇有一位老太太買了一塊零頭料，値銀八角半；據說她已經進來了一個半鐘頭了。</p>
<p>其餘靜僻的馬路，允許我「從略」了吧？</p>
<p>菜館，遊戲塲，電影院，舞廳……的霓虹燈的廣吿雖還在風雨中躋着迷眼，但恕我沒有勇氣去作一瞥的巡禮；除非是旅館，人多的話，坐下來打打麻將；假如是「光棍」，善觀氣色的茶房會挨進門來授上　塊集體照相的玻璃架的。雨關在窗外，室內的空氣是濕暖的；掛「客滿」牌子的現在該旅館業唯我獨尊了。</p>
<p>下午三個鐘頭的巡禮，我的衣服已逼着我回家了。從浴室中出來，躺到睡椅上，扭開無錢電，勞慟後的休息才知道休息之寳貴。</p>
<p>在報吿抵禦風寒應服××公司出品的××藥片的時候，報吿員忽然故作驚人之事，來了一聲咳嗽，一個突如其來的消息，是：工部局各學校明日起暫行放假。我起初以爲在報吿夜報消息，但是夜報上祇有「明日茶座大贈品」；打電話去電台上詢問，原來是工部局通知各電台報吿的。自從六年前無綫電在上海盛行以來，「公共服務報吿」尙屬首創，是亦滬市無錢電盛衰史上的　頁寳貴的史料。</p>
<p>大雨到晚上還沒有停止的預兆，或許還要繼續幾天吧。「行」的問題嚴重總還在罷工之下，一切事業上的損害確是無形的損失。俗語謂「天要落雨娘要嫁人」果然是人力所不及的；但疏通地面上的積水是在人力範圍之內的。記得去年大水時，英法兩租界曾會同計劃疏濬黃浦江及南市日暉港的支流，使上海不致造成維納絲的風景區，結果是不能執行。這一年來，黃浦江的底層大概又增高了一英吋若干分之幾了。「積沙成塔」是銀行的廣吿，在這里是應該「化整爲零」的。</p>
<p>濬疏工作是刻不容緩的！</p>
<p>雨住了便是晴天，在「搖籃」中生長的上海人，不要單單責駡老天爺，整個租界與全市市民都應該負起保衛「孤島」的責任的。請　「搖籃」中探出頭來！</p>

<h3>全國高敎敎員學術研究　戰前研究各類專題已有結果　戰後研究配合抗建實際問題</h3>
<p>（重慶航訊）學術研究工作、不僅　於研究院或研究所、全國之專科以上學校、亦同負其責、敎部曾於二十二年開始、調查全國專科以上學校敎員研究專題情形、至戰前已得有相當結果、（一）全國專科以上學校包括國立省立私立各院校作專題研究者計一千零六十六人、其中獨立研究者七三八人、合作研究者一四七人、共八八五人、大率皆爲敎員、，助理研究者一八一人、多屬助敎、按之當時全國專科以上學校之敎員總數爲七五六〇人、則從事專題研究者、的佔百分之十四强、（二）調查時問包括兩年半中之研究工作、人數爲一〇六六、題數爲一一二五、則其中同時研究兩題者不過五十九人、平均每一敎員於兩年半時間內僅研究專題一種左右、（三）合作研究人數爲三二八人、平均每一研究主任所用合作研究人數尙不足一人、而合作研究者、以助敎助理爲多、研究生次之、大學本科生絕少、（四）就研究專題性質言、實科專題較文科專題爲多、實科七四五題、文科三八〇題、的爲二與一之比、（五）以學校論、國省立院校研究員共六七六人、專題六六四件、私立院校研究員三八四人、專題四五一件、是後者較前者所需研究人員數較少、而研究之專題較多、卽以實科專題論、國省立院校研究三九四題、私立院校研究三四四題、前者所多、亦極有限、（六）以專題研究完成與吾而論、全部專題完成者五九七件、較未完成者五一八件稍多、而就國省立院校與私立院校研究完成之題數相比、前者完成二六二、後者完成三三五、私立院校研究完成之專題數亦較多、</p>
<p>由於以上說明、可見國內專科以上學校敎員對於學術研究之趨勢、其中調查容有未週、各校敎員對於呈報之熱心與否亦不一致、而研究題目之大小亦未必盡同、但於此不難概見學術研究悄形之一斑、</p>
<p>學術研究之重要、人盡知之、進而言之、固可樹立本國學術獨立之基礎、提高民挨文化之水準、卽以敎學之本位而言、爲敎授者、若對所敎學科、不事研究、不能與時俱進、則其授予學生之知識、必不免陳腐而機械、亦不能得學生之敬仰、反之、則敎授若能從事研究、其研究學問之興趣與方法、均可無形中爲學生所模範、則其貢獻、必將超過研究中只能研究學問而無機會訓練學生之人、故專科以上敎員、樂於研究學問與吾、影響於學風至大、根據上述專科以上學校敎員之專題研究情形、則似仍有設法提倡與改進之必要、其最要者、如（一）研究工作如何可以普遍、而使每一專任敎員均有其專門問題之研究、（二）每一問題之研究期間、如何可以縮短、俾研究結果得早日貢獻於社會、（三）研究合作人員或助手、如何多由研究生及本科生担任、以增進敎學效能、而培養學生之獨立研究能力、以上三點爲推進專科以上學校敎員研究工作之關鍵、各校所當共同努力者也、</p>
<p>自七七事變以後、各專科以上學校、雖多播遷轉陟、而各院校敎員之研究工作、並未稍懈、敎部曾通令各院校對各項專題研究、應予繼續努力、並指示除研究純粹學術外、允應隨時研究各種實際問題以配合抗戰建國之需要、令發之後、各院校將其最近研究工作呈報到部者、有國立叫川大學·武漢大學·省立甘肅學院·私立金陵大學·湘雅醫學院等十七校、共計專題、一百十餘件、以性質論、文史類、四十七題、農科六十一題、理科三十五題、法科一十題、敎育十六題、工科十四題、醫科七題其與抗戰軍事及西南西北建設有關之專題、計有（一）酒精代汽油之研究、（二）油類吸收毒氣之研究、（三）川邊雷馬屏峨墾殖問題、（四）我國西部軍事地理之研究、（五）西北民族研究、（六）西北民族文化及其信仰問題、（七）四川之土地利用及人口分佈、（八）羗漢問題研究、（九）中日戰爭時中國經濟所發生之影響、（十）抗戰史料編輯等、其他各院校敎員之研究問題、尙在陸續呈報與整理中、關於學術研究工作之推進亦不能僅以現任之專科以上學校敎員爲限、中央曾於一八九决常會通過保障學術人才辦法、及保障技術人員辦法、中會規定設「學術研究獎金辦法」及「確定補助金予專門人員以實習研究上之便利」各項、十八年第二决全國敎育會議時、卽曾議決根據此項原則訂定詳細辦法施行、顧以人事蹉跎及財政上困難尙難見諸實行、前决弟三屆全國敎育會議、亦曾討論及之、此後應本此初衷、切謀實現、以推進研究工作、而謀中國學術之獨立基礎也、</p>

<h3>糧食高粳抬至九十五元　為了少數人操縱粳米　遂使人人都吃了貴米</h3>
<p>溯自新破粳尖國米唯一之脚踏車來源、因雨阻斷、米價連朝一路飛騰、迭造破天荒驚人之昂價、昨日漲勢依然未煞、市貨已成奇珍、故不問津則已、一遇問價、價格任意亂喊、一般作客謀應付門市計、亟需添備者、遂亦不得不仰其鼻息、致價漲勢再接再厲、粳尖國米連騰三四元之鉅、聞常幫高粳達九十五元、普通九十三元半、蘇崑粳九十元左右、南港早稻九十二三元、新粳顓橋貨亦須八十五元、太倉嘉定羊尖七十四五元、青角杜尖七十六七元、糯米際此雖係補助之品、難與並駕齊驅、然亦附驥尾帶高元砠、金溧特元七十三元、常丹貨七十一二元、香港元相同、至此一般洋米投機家得此良機、遂不以洋米來源絡繹、反藉口於國米飛漲、伸其操縱之魔手、市面頗見震盪、緣早市因外匯回縮、前電均未轉實、市價乃在謠言聲中立被抬高近元、然漲後賣氣轉旺、實銷與囤戶均呆、且新打電報又有多起、且傳有七十七元半之二號西貢一批有成議可能、因此後市立卽回降二元許、結果反小一元、回籠原包開出三百多噸、二號西貢自七十九元至八十元、暹邏二號七十八元半、現米成交則有六千包、計開一號西貢七十四元三五角、二號陳七十元、新六十八元半、六十八元、二號暹邏六十七元、小絞六十七元、六十六元七角、米菉五十八元云、</p>
<h3>油市油價頻漲　多為投機所操縱</h3>
<p>昨日食油交易、不因暴雨減色、大局在內地本市兩感缺乏豆油供給之情形下、生油亦視為貴、故市塲中人心充滿興奮態度、且被投機捉弄、致行市頻向高峯邁進、計開膠州豆油一百件、價為七十八元半至七十九元半、青島豆油五十桶、價為一百零八元至一百十元、大連散裝油二百五十擔、價為八十八元至八十八元半、大有廠油二百擔、價為八十九元至八十九元二角半花生油成交膠州現油二百件、價為七十一元半至七十二元二角半、十月上交二百件、價為七十一元五角至七十二元半、十月下交七百件、價為七十二元七角半至七十三元七角角、青島油一百桶、價為九十七元七角半至九十八元五角、十月上交一百桶、價為九十八元、十月下交二百五十桶、價為九十八元七角至一百元、又聽裝油三百五十聽、價為九十六元云、</p>
<p>一日自烟臺運來生仁三百五十包、生油五百聽、青島來一千三百二十聽、二日有生仁八百五十包、運香港、</p>
<h3>金融外匯昨又轉緊投機商吸收無倦意</h3>
<p>外匯昨日市況、匯豐掛牌俱無更動、英美匯暗盤、反動趨緊、乃前傳流言消散、經營者止塞轉扒、初華商銀行結進最夥、究以價賤、引起投機商跟蹤扒購、於供求不平中、遂告軟化、後市日行力吸、影響不少、且投機商續進、毫無倦意、迨至晚收、英金見三辦士五一五六二五、美匯五元半、比上日英緊〇三一二五、美縮一二五、期貨與現貨相仿、</p>
<p>華商最先來購結</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條、近遠俱告平定、倫敦生金呆一、匯兌英對美不動、對滬緊〇六二五、美對英長九六八七五、對滬升二角四分、對法無市、中央掛牌各匯如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金三辦士四六八七五、美匯五元六五六二五、較之上日收市、英平美鬆〇三一二五、開後華行購進、市面稍軟、計入外行現美匯五元六二五、後投機商跟進、向外行結入本月份美匯告五元五九三七五、匯豐掛牌揭曉勿更、白銀平衡稅揭曉、並無增減、斯時華銀行會入外行現先令為三辦士五三一二五、迄午刻、華行沙遜等需要仍旺、一時賣戶稀少、價再告緊、計外行塞予華行沙遜現美匯告五元五六二五、以至五三一二五、午收價為五元五三一二五、及三辦士五一五六二五、與晨開相較英美各軟〇三一二五與一二五、</p>
<p>美匯現貨五元半</p>
<p>午後為狀續緊、因日商銀行亦來市結納、計進現美匯五元五三一二五、而投機家向某美行買本月美匯貴達五元半、如是以至收盤、尚少變化、結果英金三辦士五一五六二五、英匯五元半、本月份與現貨相同、十一月份英金三辦士半、美匯五元四六八七五、比隔昨收盤、英金期現均縮〇三一二五、美匯軟一二五、</p>
<h3>貼現回升一元　拆息掛小二分</h3>
<p>昨匯劃票據貼現率、略見同升、每千元上下午始終貼進十八元、貼出須二十元、計軋升一元、錢業公會拆息、同低二分、計掛一角云、</p>
<h3>金市一反上日賣風　急遽上漲一百二十五元</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤、暗盤陡告回漲、一反上日之激烈賣風、此以流言消散、人心向上、匯市報軟、乘機購進者、絡繹於途、更以港幫吸收頗力、金號證券幫撈入、並不後人、預料六千元大關甚易重出、本日最高見五千九百三十元、收盤為九百〇五元、較隔昨收市猛升一百二十五元、全日交易旺達三千五百餘兩、銀樓飾金、終則掛大二十元、關金等仍平、</p>
<p>人心之佳出於意外</p>
<p>晨初人心之佳、誠出意料、金號首進、銀號二十兩、為五千九百元、作開盤價、後金號乘高售出不支下降、計證券幫賣與金號三十兩、為五千八百十五元、乃當日最低價、但外匯報緊、錢兌業曁證券幫均來吸收、價復高昂、計證券幫入錢兌業二十兩、五千八百八十元、後某錢兌業及散戶稍吐、價乃微挫、終因港電銀號證券幫金號等齊購、其時買氣陡盛、越出九百元之實、金號進證券幫十兩、告五千九百十元、迨至午刻、買風略　、惟匯市仍軟、價得堅持、證券幫出金號二十兩、曾回為五千八百七十元、金號入證券幫十兩、告五千八百九十五元、結果銀號售予金號十兩、為五千八百八十五元、作收價為之一撳、計金號出銀號十兩、五千八百八十五元、收盤前港幫吃胃殊厚、竭力購買、價拉高至五千九百〇五元、為晚收價、比上日軋升一百二十元、全日上落一百十五元、現金號之本牌金售價、較烚赤高十餘元、收進減低三十元、現標金照掛牌低五十餘元、均鮮做開、</p>
<p>飾金改懸六百十元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金、每兩兌出、晨初已掛大十元、午後又高十元、計大同行懸六百十元、新同行與上價相仿、收進減低三十元光景、</p>
<h3>美票又昂</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市況、因隔昨所傳之流言、均無從證實、是以烚赤暗市、回漲甚勁、英美金鎊因亦一致回起三元、英金票供求均勻、市價站平、美金票以黑市美匯回縮甚厲、故晚市抬至十八元、比上日回起四角二分、香港票不乏需要、市價漲起三分、日金票則續疲五釐、晚市為一元四角七分半、朝鮮票稍有需要、市價回漲一分半、晚市為一元一角七分半、</p>
<h3>銀行準備會減低國幣利率</h3>
<p>上海銀行業聯合準備會、於昨日（一日）起、改更利率如左、（公單拆款息）國幣二角五分、匯劃一角八分、（承兌匯票九·十日期貼現率）國幣二角五分、匯劃一角八分、（領用同業匯劃息）一角五分、（存息除五分）同業匯劃拆放欠息）一角八分、係均為每千元每日計算、</p>
<p>「附註」上項利率與九月十七日比較、匯劃利率未有變更、國幣利率均減低三分、</p>
<h3>證券　債市平和</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨市比較和平、初因昆明被炸而微小、繼以補空而微堅、丁戊兩種又見新高價、而甲種反略疲、各幫人氣已較和緩、放空顧忌甚多、未敢放胆多做、價格過高、尙欲待機、趨勢或將穩定、全日交易、以信孚始終買進、為數較鉅、市價賴以維持、卅八號需要亦殷、久豐則全日傾向出籠、聯益天生亦有出脫、市價初跌後漲、丁戊種再見新高價、前途仍待環境之推移、市況結果一致再漲二三角至四角半、成交約一百二十萬元左右、茲列簡明表於後</p>
<p>股票交易、成交商務印書館三十股、價為七十五元五角、</p>
<p>昨日眾業股市平非穩、凡交易不多、晨初價格一度軟化、下午約略回堅、各著名橡皮股之問津者亦較多、</p>
<h3>紗花棉紗進出　大有舉棋不定狀某取引所已開市</h3>
<p>紗市始跌繼回、局勢又有倐起落之象、實則多空兩方、大有舉棋不定之嘆、市塲上業內外者心思、大都以看好占多數、但價格高、多頭又來出籠、而空方亦活動、於是遂呈飄盪靡定之局面也、不過實際銷路大為減色、然人心一致看漲、惟時局幻變莫測也、今日有棉紗四百九十件運香港、</p>
<p>現紗晨開、因上日午後金價大墜、空頭乘機壓迫、浮多紛起了結、檯面稍鬆、二十支雙馬初做價為一千〇九十元、旋以賣者擁擠、直跌至一千〇七十五元、低價一見、大多數認為回跌已達相當程度、不妨做兩包多頭、無啥要緊、於是你進我更買、一閱直漲至一千一百元外、查半日間成交統計四千一百〇五包、行情二十支雙馬跌十元、茲將各帮口買去之額量分列於左、</p>
<p>同行三、六三〇香港四七五統計四、一〇五</p>
<p>傳說多時之某取引所、昨日已開幕、二十支藍鳳紗為標準、單位為五十包、據云頭盤十一月期價為一千元、遠期一月價為九百六十元、二盤十一月期跌至九百七十八元、收盤平平、</p>
<h3>外棉現銷特盛</h3>
<p>現棉情形、尙屬平庸、但人心因來源艱難、仍舊看升、然國際動盪不定、前途不易捉摸也、所以棉市成交未能十分興奮也、</p>
<p>另訊外棉市價、紐約棉市、晨初卽因現貨需要之不良及一部份之多頭了結、結果收盤價格較之上日跌三四磅音、印度運同預測跌一羅比餘、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、日來繼續熱鬧異常、但俱為現貨交易、各方以購買裝船貨之不易、且市上存底之不豐、故同業搜購現貨之心頗烈、尤以長纖維者為最、按照目前之形勢、棉市頗為堅定也、</p>
<h3>疋頭　布銷岑寂</h3>
<p>國布昨市勢穩定、蓋紗價依然堅挺、惟大雨終日、街市積水、交通不便、本街營業頗受影響、各市售價以廠盤堅實、大部份仍開原價、細斜因染銷活動、每疋繼漲二角半之譜、本街成交二三百件、粵港帮辦藍布斜紋又近二百餘件、浙閩帮辦色布、色斜百餘件、進路烟台辦粗布絨布百餘件、</p>

<h3>我們希望能增多平糶處</h3>
<p>— 秀碧</p>
<p>每天打平糶處經過的時候，看見那麼長長的一列，心中總不免有說不出的悲病。</p>
<p>這一列買米的人往往足足有二十多家，甚至三四十家舖面那麼長，他們中間有高齡的婦人，也有年幼的孩子。他們也常常是亂擠着的？囚之，皮鞭也常常會降臨到他們的臉部。</p>
<p>我們也經常地聽見發生在平糶的擁擠中的許多悲慘的故事，一個老婦人或一個孩子的給擠傷，給擠死，是已經成爲不罕見的事了。</p>
<p>我們覺得這是一個急需改進的問題。</p>
<p>改進的方法，首先而且也是唯一的，便是要求當局增多平糶處，我們認爲現在所以發生這種悽慘的現象，其原因就是爲了平糶處太少；實在說來，現在每一决輪流到的平糶處，只是聊聊十幾處而已，和全市米店總數並不能成一個「成數量」的比例。我們常常看到當無數、的人向一家米店鵠立待購之時，附近總有不少的米店却空閒着，米店中的夥計也閒閒地呆望着那列悽慘的行列。這是一個太不平均的現象。</p>
<p>增多平糶處並不是一個困難的辦法，在當局要是使現在的平糶處能增多二三悄，那末對於貧民固然能受到難言的恩典，在整個的米店方面，因爲店舖的浩多，也並不會感到些微的不方便，輪流的决數也決不會過多的。</p>

<h3>今日上海</h3>

<h3>安息日</h3>
<p>— 博文彥</p>
<p>安息日。禮拜堂的鐘聲和着讚美詩在微風中送來。</p>
<p>電影院的早塲開映「火燒紅蓮寺」，孩子翻過報紙對我說，—其實也是徵求我的意見。我正在把軟片裝進攝影鏡箱中去，預備到公園去消逝一個早晨，自然我也決不會忘了今天是孩子們的日子。聽了孩子的報告，就問他：「看電影去，還是拍照去？他迅速地放棄了「一道白光」的念頭，要他母親替他計劃攝影時的服裝問題了。</p>
<p>秋天的陽光是溫暖地，風是輕微地，公園的小池邊滿佈了小朋友們的足跡：有的躺在地上，有的打着球，也有蹲下身子，用小手謹愼地去抓池邊的浮萍……孩子的天眞活潑，揚溢在這小小的一角天地。</p>
<p>替他們拍了幾張照，我就在草地上坐下來看報。沒有十分鐘的間隔，他們已沿着河邊走了一圈回來，小的孩子還報告了一件新聞：「那邊有買麵包的。」其實這和「火燒紅蓮寺」一樣在徵求我的意見。</p>
<p>「讓他們高興地過一個星期早晨吧。」我帶着他們向對池走去。</p>
<p>在茅亭裏，有一個穿白制服的侍者在電爐上烤麵包，—叫做Hot　Dog的。沿茅亭圍着的人像電影院的售票櫃前一樣，不過孩子很少，都是年靑的少爺小姐。我給了孩子錢，他們從人叢中擠進去了。我倚在一株樹下等着，一而暗忖都市中至少有一部份人還在太陽光下過生活；但是這念頭剛在腦海中掠過的時候，再敏捷也沒有—立刻被身旁的談話驅走了。</p>
<p>在我身邊走過的是五六個男女靑年，他們已經佔先捉得了那「熱狗」，邊吃邊走，那種高興的神情是超過他們年齡以上的。說話的是一個穿淺綠旗袍，肩胛揹着一隻皮包（太像小學生的書包了）的小姐，她說：</p>
<p>「不是跳一個通宵，那裏吃得着這樣的好點心？」</p>
<p>再抬起眼睛向茅亭外圍掠過，十分之九都是熬了一個通宵來吃這樣好點心的顧客。不是嗎？孩子們捧着麵包跳到我面前來的時候，又是一個報告：「麵包賣光了！」</p>
<p>忽然一個怪的念頭湧上來，我把孩子們吃麵包的神氣照了一張像片，雖然他們昨夜睡得很早，這「點心」是意外的收穫而不值得紀念的。</p>
<p>「道時候熱狗」在滿園子飛着走，太陽也漸漸向頭頂抬高。</p>
<p>「好同去睡覺了！」不知那一位小姐的嬌呼驚醒了我，早晨已經很快的飛逝了。</p>
<p>安息日，我望着他們回家去安睡，也帶着孩子們歸家。</p>
<p>霍桑探案</p>
<h3>舞后的歸宿</h3>
<p>— 程小靑著</p>
<p>第八章　捉住了兩個人</p>
<p>伊走進辦公窒時，向霍桑和我都戀着些腰，點點頭，臉上帶着不很自然的微笑，代替了先前的那股虛騙之氣。我暗忖早晨時霍桑所給予的敎訓，想不到竟會有這樣迅速的收獲。霍桑和我當然也站起來跟伊招呼。大家坐定以後，伊的稱呼措詞也加上了禮貌的外套。</p>
<p>伊說道：「霍先生，包先生，這件事很勞你們的神。你總已到麗蘭家裏去察勘過了罷？可已得到什麼線索？」</p>
<p>霍桑答道：「線索已有幾條，又已捉住了兩個人。不過我正要跟你談一談。你來得正好。」</p>
<p>我聽霍桑的語氣，分明不願把我們剛才到伊寓裏去敲門的一回事說破，伊當然也不會知道敲門的人就是霍桑。</p>
<p>姜安娜問道：「霍先生，我本來有些意思要告訴你。現在你旣然實地察勘了一冋，叉已有了幾條線索，那末不妨說出來合一合。」</p>
<p>霍桑點點頭道：「我想先聽聽你的意思。姜小姐，你想這件事是什麼人幹的？」</p>
<p>姜安娜略略疑遲了一下。「我看那小余很有可疑。」</p>
<p>「小余？——余甘棠嗎？你有什麼理由？」</p>
<p>「他最近跟麗蘭鬧翻了。起初他們是火一般熱的。最近　蘭交識了一個姓趙的，那小余使鬧着醋勁，曾向麗蘭說過許多可怕的話。麗蘭都曾告訴我。現在麗蘭突然間被人打死，我不能不疑心他。霍先後你對這個人可曾查明什麼？他的行動上也有行兇的可能嗎？」</p>
<p>霍桑點頭道：「有的，他在行動上確有可疑的地方。現在他已被押在警署裏。」</p>
<p>安娜驚喜地說：「唉，那好極。這個人太沒良心。麗蘭起先迷戀着他，待他非常好。他一反臉便會這樣，那簡直太可惡。霍先生，他已招認了沒有？」</p>
<p>霍桑搖頭道：「還沒有。你可知道麗蘭和小余相交已有多少時候？」</p>
<p>「那是今年春天相識的——大概總有三四個月了罷？」　（一二四</p>
<h3>三個凄慘的鏡頭</h3>
<p>— 江旅</p>
<p>傍晚，從夕陽殘照中，信步同家。在馬路上，以眼珠爲天然鏡箱，攝到了三個悽慘的鏡頭。</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>一個胖胖的送飯人，挑着包飯人家吃剩的殘羹冷飯，匆匆地在人潮中擠着向前。預伏在牆隅的三個「倒冷飯者」，恍如獵犬發現了兎子，一窠蜂的擁上來；那個送飯人，好似默契似的，連忙歇下來，任他們爭奪着飯桶中剩餘的不到半碗的冷秈米飯，和一些湯汁，儘向鐵罐中倒。一個手脚遲緩一點的，連湯汁也沒有一滴了，他憤恨地駡道：「他媽的，冷飯這麼少！」</p>
<p>「現在米貴了，包飯作裹限定每客二碗。還輪得到你們來倒嗎？」挑菜的等他們悻悻然的去了，才挑起菜祖來回去</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>在一家米店門口，有一僩衣衫襤褸的婦人，手裏抱一個三歲模樣的孩子，旁邊還站着一個六、七歲的孩子。婦人從衣袋中，橫摸豎摸，才摸出一把縐得不成樣的五分輔幣劵，交給夥計，說：「量一升米。」</p>
<p>那夥計厭惡地理着輔幣劵，點一點道：「只有五角五分，連碎米還買不到一升呢。」</p>
<p>「先生，請你幫幫忙，量一升吧！」</p>
<p>在一隻洋麵袋底裏，貯着一些米，癟癟的，但孩子們的臉上，已堆着笑。</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>一輛裝滿米的卡車，停在米棧前。一個橫眉怒目的執着鞭子的人，高高地坐在米袋上，卡車的四週，有一羣耗子似的掃米的人，在出沒着。</p>
<p>一根鐵桿，偷偷的挿入米袋中，用力一抽，米就順勢的流到他們的布袋中。</p>
<p>「他媽的！」皮鞭隨着叱駡聲落到掃米者的頭上。</p>
<p>但他們爲了耍塞飽肚子，便忍受着皮鞭的痛楚，在西躲東避地用「閃電戰略」竊取米袋中的米。</p>
<p>這是飢餓綫上的生存鬥爭呀…</p>
<h3>兒童的刧運</h3>
<p>— 王沛</p>
<p>上海眞如一個黑的大海，大海中充滿着噬人的惡鯨；成人們果然免不了要在這黑海中掙扎，就是天眞無邪的兒童們，也免不了被黑的大海染上了顏色，或被惡鯨所吞噬。</p>
<p>在數星期前，木刋曾正義地揭發了以兒童作爲竊盜工具的機關；在前期的本刋中，某君又發現了被誘騙指使而竊盜的兒童。這些敗類的存在，一般無知的兒童極易墮其彀中，因而遭受着極嚴重的品格上及精神上的損失，甚或養成兒童竊盜的惡習。欲免自己的子弟爲黑水所染，其責還在家長和學校的周密的防範，及時時的警告兒童，至少得使兒童們知道被騙了的自己，將變成怎樣的一個人！</p>
<p>兒童失踪的事件時有所聞，大規模之拐帶兒童出口之機關也已破獲二起；破獲是破獲了，可是難免不有第三第四個拐孩機關的存在。這是兒童的刧運，兒童的家畏們！敎師們！儘量地加以防範，以避免刧運降臨已身，事後的懊惱是徒然的，事前的防範才是事半功倍的！</p>

<h3>秋涼後　上海書塲的新氣象</h3>
<p>— 聿修</p>
<p>秋風送凉，溽暑全消，上海書塲在這個時候，例有一番人事方面的調整，紛紛羅致饗檔，放長擋數，以資號召，互相競爭得很厲害。現在中秋已過，各書塲部署略定，已經陸續開書，所以陣容一新，老聽客又可以不愁沒有過癮的地方了。</p>
<p>夏荷生　東山再起</p>
<p>就日塲看，自以「好友」的陣容最爲堅强。擁有黃異庵，許櫃祥，吳均安，陳魏擋（陳雪芳同魏含英）四大嚮擋，他們旗鼓相當，各有號召一部分聽客的能力；而允以「陳魏」一擋，爲最受歡迎。因爲在上海對於「沈薛」的珠塔，聽的實在過於膩了，現在來換一換口味，確實是要比較新鮮一點。决之是「南園」的張鴻聲和夏荷生。張鴻聲「飛機英烈，」對上海聽客似乎特別來得有緣，所以一復再復，終不覺其討厭；而「描王」夏荷生，息影已久，現在東山再起，不必說，自然又是大紅特紫的了。</p>
<p>楊仁林　到處歡迎</p>
<p>夜塲廬」比較爲動聽，有汪雲峯楊仁林爲中堅。大書中說金槍的原不很多，自石秀峯物化之後，物以稀爲貴，汪雲峯遂變爲說金槍中唯一的大響檔了。楊仁林是楊筱亭的兒子，家舉淵博，叉挾有一條久唱不壞的好喉嚨，自然要到處受人歡迎了。此外，普餘社的女彈詞，爲人才所限，始終只好保持「南京」一角，不能有發展的機會；而揚州書康又華的三國，居然叉在「龍園」出現，那裏江北同鄕很多，據說營業還着實不壞呢。</p>
<p>從業員　顯然過剩</p>
<p>上海書塲，說書從業員過剩的情形，近來愈加顯著，這只要看第一流的鐸詞名家像「沈薛」「蔣朱，」現在都沒有較好的塲子，可以容身；而以「描王」夏荷生的身價，也只有侷促在南園一隅，就可以明白了。同時塲東和聽客方面，還有一種心裏上的矛盾：就是塲東希望檔數多，時間長，可以增加一點收人：而聽客則嫌比檔數加多後書說的短，過不來癮。所以各書塲的營業，都不能做的頂好，就是這個原因。這是種普遍的現象，我以爲倒是一個值得注意的問題咧。</p>
<h3>孔夫子影響人物考（六）</h3>
<p>— 天野繪　靑鳥撰</p>
<p>叔孫，季孫，均爲魯之上大夫，魯政權分散，受制於大夫，大夫復受制於家臣，二人者，蓋不能上事其君，而下御其家臣者也。與孟孫爲魯之三家，皆桓公之後。</p>
<p>孔子有一女，名不彰。二十歲得子，名鯉，字伯魚，伯魚生子思。伯魚，生逢夫子奔定天下之時，復早死，未能盡傳夫子之道。及夫子晚年，門牆凋謝，家人零落，膝下相倚爲命者，僅一子思。子思名伋，後受學於會子，盡傳孔氏之學，爲孟子師，後世尊爲述聖。</p>

<h3>「海國英雄」觀感</h3>
<p>— 沈琪</p>
<p>如果說是「海國英雄」不够刺激，或者說是高風不及「明末遺恨」多，那是實在錯覺，至少對於這部戲劇的理解力是薄弱的。爲此，這裏是要特別提出劇中所含蓄的成份。</p>
<p>在「明末遺恨」中，以葛嫩娘與孫克咸的生命，反襯時代的血史，那般慘痛，那般陰鬱。但是，不能說不是弱點者，就是燦爛光明的空氣太低壓了。</p>
<p>這决「海國英雄」的浪出，首先就是克服這個弱點，全劇充滿强烈的積極性，暴露着鄭芝龍的叛國，結果也是不會博到主子完全的歡心，觀衆心中，一定理解的，同時，啟示鄭成功多少年來的鬬爭，勝了是打下去，敗了也是打下去，憑着自己的經騐，傳給自己的兒女，（經與瑜）長期的抗戰，目的是要博到最後的勝利。並且，更是積極的，說明這種工作是不分男女老幼，凡是明朝的子孫，就該勇敢地擔負着的。</p>
<p>在意義上，那樣地富有熱烈的朝氣，簡直令人觀後，心都要沸騰着的。劇巾穿挿鄭妻董氏和老將張名振的忠心耿耿，都足說明在大時代中，不論女人和老人，也是一樣該向時代的最前崗位走着。</p>
<p>說到道决演出，動員目下劇影兩界的優秀演員，顧蘭君的董氏，深刻生動的一種表情，充分發揮着劇中人的身份，在她雖然初决踏上舞台，在我相信，她自從演過銀幕上的葛嫩娘後，對於時代的了解力是淸楚的，吾則不會演到那樣圓熟體切的。劉瓊的鄭成功，毅然沉着，把劇中人的性格充分把握着的，不過後來二幕，時間上已經相隔十多年了，在化妝上似乎應該更蒼老一點。此外，屠光啟的郭必昌，陳琦的鄭瑜，以及嚴　的馬金子，一貫着在「明末遺恨」中的作風與綫條。</p>
<p>全劇背景服裝，比較上還是逼眞自然，音響效果也很成功，不過開幕前的鑼聲，病於機械化了。</p>
<h3>「琳丁丁」第二</h3>
<p>— 伯奮</p>
<p>好萊塢有一隻狗，名字叫但賽（Daisy），聰明伶俐，被稱爲「琳丁丁」第二。</p>
<p>但賽在去年獲得美國電影藝術科學院的動物演技最佳金像獎，費文麗和勞勃杜奈得到A級「奧斯卡」牠獲得了B級奧斯卡，這榮譽在美國電影史上尚屬初决。</p>
<p>也許你不相信，狗主人里尼雷佛洛（Rennie　Renfro）購進但賽的代價是五角美金，而現在，單單這隻狗的保險費已逮二萬五千元，其他可知，里尼雷佛洛靠了牠，已變成萬貫家財的富翁了。</p>
<p>但賽是一隻雄狗，牠沒有替身，最近才由狗主人在南加里福尼亞找到一頭。</p>
<p>牠的處女作是「我若爲王」，之後曾在五張白朗弟家庭片中表演，最近拍攝“Blondieon　a　Bndget”一片時，接到一千封以上的影迷贊美信，全體工作人員合購一所精美狗舍給牠享用，此外，居然還用牠的脚替影迷「簽名」，達八五〇次之多。　但賽也會交結朋友，最要好的是哥倫比亞第九號攝影塲上的一頭貓，名字叫Sebastian。</p>
<p>但賽成名後，非但物質享受精美豐富，狗主人還替牠請了著名訓練師羅特惠賽威克斯來，專司保護之責。</p>

<h3>British Policy Shifts Towards Aggressiveness, Unanimously Advocating Reopening the Burma Road; Guo Taiqi and British Undersecretary of State Hold Practical Discussions on the Matter; Hull States US Opposition to Closure Remains Unchanged</h3>
<p>London - According to important news obtained from responsible sources in Reuters, the most important matter is the possibility of reopening the Burma Road. It is reported that the main condition of the British-Japanese agreement to close the road was that China and Japan should strive for a common compromise. In view of Japan's actions in Vietnam in recent weeks, London believes that there is no impression that the Eastern powers are willing to reach this compromise. Therefore, it is not impossible that the Burma Road may be reopened after the current British-Japanese agreement expires soon. (Reuters dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>Washington - It is believed here that Britain will open the Burma Road. When Secretary of State Hull received reporters, he was asked whether the United States would welcome this move. Hull replied that since expressing the US government's opposition to the closure of this road in July, there has been no change in US policy. Some observers speculate that the US$25 million loan to China was granted based on an understanding of the opening of the Burma Road. (Reuters dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>London - Britain, which is inclined to reopen the Burma Road, has reportedly discussed with the various Dominions a policy of restricting goods to Japan that is not a complete blockade. It is heard that yesterday afternoon, British authorities discussed this matter with senior officials from Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. In addition, Chinese Ambassador to Britain Guo Taiqi also held discussions with British Foreign Secretary Butler yesterday. Sources familiar with the matter believe that British Prime Minister Churchill may meet with Ambassador Guo soon to discuss the Far Eastern situation as a result of Japan's alliance with Germany and Italy. According to well-informed sources, although semi-official sources say that Britain has not yet decided to reopen the Burma Road, the majority in favor of reopening the road is overwhelming, at a ratio of twenty to one. Asked about this matter, the Chinese diplomatic community does not attach much importance to the reopening of the Burma Road, believing that this British gesture is irrelevant at this time. Authoritative Chinese figures point out that now that Japan has invaded Vietnam and joined the Axis powers of Germany and Italy, Britain must take more active actions than reopening the Burma Road to contain Japan. Ambassador Guo also discussed with Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky last night the Soviet Union's attitude towards the German-Italian-Japanese agreement. Yesterday's editorial in the Soviet Pravda on the tripartite agreement failed to arouse foreign goodwill. Many here believe that the Soviet Union may be very willing for Japan to go to war with Britain and the United States, so that the belligerents will suffer mutual losses, while the Soviet Union reaps the benefits. In addition, diplomatic circles here have learned of an unconfirmed report that informal Japanese-Soviet negotiations are underway. The conditions are that Japan will focus on invading the South, respect Soviet advantages in Outer Mongolia and Xinjiang, and the Soviet Union will stop helping China. However, Soviet officials deny this information. According to reliable British sources, negotiations between Britain, the United States, and Australia are proceeding smoothly. (United Press dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>Singapore - The headquarters of the United China Relief Fund here has telegraphed British Prime Minister Churchill and other leaders, requesting the reopening of the Burma Road. (United Press dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>Chongqing - The Chinese Labor Association previously telegraphed the leaders of the British Labor Party, urging the British government to cancel its decision to prohibit transportation to China via the Burma Road. Now that the three-month ban on the Burma Road is about to expire, the association has again telegraphed the British Labor Party, urging the central government to immediately open the Burma Road. (Dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>Chongqing - As the agreement between Britain and Japan to close the Burma Road is about to expire, all sectors of the Chinese community have been vigorously advocating the reopening of the road. Chinese newspapers have been publishing editorials for four consecutive days, appealing to Britain to reopen the road, citing the Japanese invasion of Vietnam and the alliance of Germany, Italy, and Japan as the main arguments, and asking Britain to reconsider its Far Eastern policy, stating that opening the road would not only benefit China but also Britain. This morning, the newspapers carried Foreign Minister Wang's views on the tripartite alliance, stating only that China is determined to continue the war of resistance, without indicating what countermeasures China will take against Germany and Italy's recognition of Japan's leadership in Asia. Today's editorial in the Central Daily News states that the current situation in the Pacific is mostly caused by the failure of cooperation between Britain and the United States. Britain failed to respond to the US proposal during the "September 18th Incident," resulting in the loss of US trust. The Tianjin Silver Agreement and the closure of the Burma Road further disappointed the United States. Now that the United States is helping Britain in the European war and intensifying economic pressure on Japan, and is discussing naval cooperation in the Atlantic and Pacific with Britain, it is now time for Britain to take parallel action with the United States in the Far East, and opening the Burma Road would be the most obvious manifestation of this move.

<h3>Vietnamese Authorities Tighten Military Deployment to Prevent Further Japanese Offenses; French and Japanese Representatives Resume Negotiations; Situation in Hanoi Gradually Stabilizes Yesterday; Large Chinese Forces Gather in Southern Guangxi to Strictly Block Japanese Army's Northern Advance Along the Highway</h3>
<p>Hanoi - A delegation of Japanese military representatives and personnel under Annam Governor Decoux have begun talks again, while French military officers in Vietnam are still supervising their troops to step up their military preparations in Annam to prevent further Japanese aggression. The general situation in Hanoi gradually stabilized yesterday, and the blackout has been lifted. Most of the refugees have also returned, but workers continue to dig air-raid shelters, and the windows of various shops have been fitted with defensive structures to avoid damage from bombs. Most shops are still closed, and the Chinese have all evacuated. It is heard that the Japanese government yesterday issued instructions to investigate the bombing of Haiphong when the Japanese army landed on the 26th of last month, so as to clarify responsibility. It is heard that the Japanese side has agreed in principle to pay considerable damages to the 18 Vietnamese natives who were injured and the families of the 15 Vietnamese natives who were killed in the bombing. Since the Japanese army occupied Lang Son, the train arriving here from Lang Son last night was the first to resume traffic, but the train arriving here carried 60 wounded French and Vietnamese soldiers, as the Japanese army has begun to release prisoners captured in the Lang Son area. The Japanese army's occupation of the Gia Lam airport (transliteration) on the border of Hanoi is expected to be implemented today. General observers believe that Hanoi's current situation is extremely critical, as the airport occupied by the Japanese army is extremely close, separated from Hanoi by only one river. (United Press dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>Hanoi - After a Japanese plane bombed Haiphong port some time ago, the Vietnamese authorities lodged a protest through diplomatic channels. The Japanese government has now ordered an investigation into the names of the pilots involved and has accepted in principle to compensate the victims or their families. Some of the officers and soldiers injured in the battle of Lang Son City arrived here by rail in the evening, and more than 60 others will arrive soon. In addition, General Nishihara, head of the Japanese delegation, and General Suzuki, a special envoy of the Japanese government, accompanied by Japanese Consul General Suzuki, visited Vietnamese Governor-General General Decoux and Vietnamese Garrison Commander General Matin in the morning. (Havas dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - The Yomiuri Shimbun recently reported that Matsumiya, the special envoy to the South Seas and India, will leave Tokyo on October 11 to negotiate an economic treaty with Vietnam. (United Press dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>Tokyo - The Imperial General Headquarters here appointed Major General Kakuta yesterday as the leader of the military group of the Japanese Investigation Committee in Vietnam, replacing Major General Nishihara. (Haitong Agency dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>Chongqing - According to news from the Chinese army in southern Guangxi, the Japanese army in Vietnam has reached Ge Ban (transliteration, at the end of the new highway from Vietnam to Longzhou in western Guangxi, which was built after the Japanese army occupied Nanning). The Chinese army is now heavily gathered in southern Guangxi, preparing to resist the Japanese army's northward advance into Guangxi along the new highway. According to a Kunming telegram, 45 Japanese planes yesterday entered Yunnan via Guangxi, of which 27 bombed the slum area outside the South Gate of Kunming, causing the most severe damage. The Japanese planes flew over the entire city from the South Gate and reached the northeast corner of the city, dropping bombs along the way. Three bombs fell on Nanpi Street, the busiest street in the city. Chinese fighter planes took off to intercept them, and anti-aircraft guns also fired fiercely. (Reuters dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>Hanoi - The French soldiers wounded in Lang Son arrived here last night on a Red Cross train. The most seriously injured are French soldiers, but there are also a few Vietnamese soldiers who are in critical condition. After these wounded soldiers arrived here, some of them talked about the failure of the Lang Son battle and the suffering of the Chinese people who fled. (United Press dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>Thai Planes Invade Vietnamese Territory, French Side Fires Back</p>
<p>Bangkok - Officials here announced today that the Thai plane that reportedly invaded the Vietnamese border and strafed a French police station with machine guns has been fired upon by the French side. It is reported that the Thai government had requested the Vietnamese authorities to instruct French postal planes to cross the border at designated points, but French airmen ignored the request. Therefore, Thailand sent planes to monitor the flight paths of French postal planes along the border. (Haitong Agency dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>Vietnamese Police Shoot and Kill, Thailand Demands Punishment</p>
<p>Bangkok - It was announced here today that a Thai merchant was shot and killed by Annamese police in the Vietnamese border town of Wenghan (transliteration). It is reported that the police asked the Thai merchant to show his passport, and when the merchant failed to do so, the police opened fire. The Thai government has now demanded an immediate investigation into the case, punishment of the perpetrators, and compensation for the merchant's family. (Haitong Agency dispatch, 1st)</p>

<h3>Fierce Fighting on the Jiangsu-Anhui Border, Fiercest Fighting North of Tianchang, Chinese Army Kills Over a Thousand Japanese Soldiers</h3>
<p>Tunxi - The fighting on the northern border of Jiangsu and Anhui has been raging for the past ten days. Currently, the Chinese army is carrying out a mopping-up operation in the area west of Gaoyou and Baoying on the south bank of Hongze Lake. Since the 15th, the fighting north of Tianchang on the Jiangsu-Anhui border has been fierce, with the Chinese killing over a thousand Japanese soldiers. After the 20th, the Japanese army gathered a force of four to five thousand and divided into several groups to reinforce and counterattack on the Jiangsu-Anhui border. Fierce fighting is currently taking place north and south of Tianchang. (Dispatch, 1st)</p>

<h3>Reasons for the Japanese Bombing of Kunming</h3>
<p>Chongqing - Kunming sources recently stated that the Japanese planes recklessly bombed the urban area of Kunming yesterday, causing enormous damage to foreign property. It is generally believed that this was the result of Yunnan Chairman Long Yun refusing the Japanese request to oppose Chongqing. The message claimed that because Chairman Long was determined to defend Yunnan Province and resist Japanese attacks, it caused dissatisfaction among the Japanese forces in South China, and the bombing of Kunming was carried out as retaliation. The Japanese planes, which took off from their base in Vietnam, dropped over 150 bombs in Kunming, killing hundreds of people. Foreign properties such as the YMCA, the Banque de l'Indochine, commercial hotels, and the British Church Hospital were damaged. (United Press dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Soviet Newspaper Discusses the Struggle for Vietnam</h3>
<p>Moscow - International affairs expert Izheevski published an article in the Communist magazine yesterday entitled "The Struggle for Vietnam," stating that the European war has caused drastic changes in the relevant forces in the Pacific. Japan is now aiming to strengthen its position in the South Seas. France's defeat has further stimulated Japan's imperial ambitions. Japan views Vietnam not only as a base for attacking British and American interests in the South Pacific, but also as a source of raw materials. Japan also intends to use Vietnam as a base for attacking China. The increasing sharpness of the Pacific imperialist conflict exposes the expansion of the scope of the war and will evolve into a worldwide imperialist war. (Dispatch, 1st)</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Compatriots Respond to the Winter Clothing Drive</h3>

<h3>The New Stage in the Development of the International Situation</h3>
<p>The alliance concluded by Germany, Italy, and Japan, the public opinion and reactions of the world these days, seem to have caused no surprise or panic whatsoever. Therefore, the attempt by the three countries to sign this alliance, at least a portion of it, has initially declared failure. On the contrary, from then on, within the opposing international camp, there will no longer be any divergent discussions about the relationship between these three countries, unifying and strengthening the pace of response; the possibility of them taking advantage of gaps and defeating each other individually has completely disappeared from then on. There are still two doubts among the general public: first, since this three-country alliance relationship has always existed informally, then why did Germany suddenly sign a non-aggression pact with the Soviet Union on the eve of its declaration of war on Poland last year, admitting that it had abandoned the Japanese alliance? And secondly, since it had superficially abandoned its alliance relationship with Japan for more than a year, why has it now solidified it again and appeared before the world in a threatening posture, you must know: the relationship between the three countries has always been consistent, Germany's move last year was just a means of anesthetizing the Soviet Union, and the move now! It is attempting to scare off the United States. In the end, they are simply attempting to create the so-called "New European Order" and "New Greater East Asia Order" through cooperation; bluntly speaking, it is the partitioning of the world!</p>
<p>From the three countries' intentions to the signing of the alliance, the international situation has become clearer, and a new demarcation standard has been established: all those who, in their position, contradict or oppose the so-called two "new orders" in Europe and Asia are the common enemies of Germany, Italy, and Japan. Therefore, all other countries' foreign relations in the future have also established a common direction.</p>
<p>Let's talk about Britain first. In the future, the British Isles are only one of the targets of the German-Italian "New European Order"; the British Empire's vast interests in Asia are one of the targets of the Japanese "New Greater East Asia Order"; and considering its position in maintaining the post-Treaty of Versailles world order of the entire empire, it is the largest target of their partition: in short, Britain and Germany, Italy, and Japan stand in opposition everywhere, and there is no room for reconciliation. In the past, Britain's fundamental principle in dealing with Europe and Asia was to treat them separately. Like the British-Soviet cooperation negotiations that began in April of last year, from the beginning, Britain opposed proposals that included the Far East, causing the initial negotiations to completely fail. And later in July, in order to cope with the increasing European crisis at the time, the British government under Prime Minister Chamberlain even signed the "Tokyo Agreement." Since Britain declared war on Germany last September, this policy has been particularly blatant, and in the end, there was the closure of the Burma Road this July. The banner that Britain is waving in this European war is opposition to power politics, but we rarely hear anyone advocating that this principle be universally applied to the Far East. Their consistent empty words about the Far East are the so-called "hope that peace between China and Japan will be restored as soon as possible, and if possible, the British government is willing to contribute its services." It is in these recent months that Britain has been trying its best to prevent Japan from approaching Germany and Italy. But in the end, all of this was completely in vain, and Germany, Italy, and Japan officially signed the alliance! From now on, Britain is not only an invaded country in Europe; in Asia, it stands in the same position as China, as an invaded country. Then, its policy of treating and dealing with Europe and Asia separately in recent years will inevitably be completely abandoned.</p>
<p>Secondly, speaking of the United States. The third article of this three-country alliance has clearly made the United States their common greatest enemy, constituting the main factor in the formal announcement of this alliance. Of course, it cannot be said that this step has no immediate effect; it first prevented the United States from interfering with Japan's invasion of Vietnam. If it were not for the announcement of this alliance, then the United States would probably have applied considerable pressure, forcing Japan to yield; the fundamental situation has now changed, and that has of course become a thing of the past. However, looking out into the distant and vast realm, the impact of the United States' entire foreign policy is countless times greater than the current Vietnam issue. From now on, the important debate between the pro-Atlantic defense or the pro-Pacific defense factions in the United States will of course also become a thing of the past, and the correctness of the two-ocean navy faction's advocacy has been completely confirmed. And the most fundamental point is that the psychology of the general American public of staying outside the international arena and helping others has now suffered a fatal blow! Although Ribbentrop said that the United States could also create a new order in the Americas, the United States would not be hypnotized again. Therefore, in addition to announcing a $25 million loan to China recently, some people are already calling out that the United States' first line of defense in the future is Britain in Europe and China in the Far East! The theories of only defending the Western Hemisphere and not getting involved in any other wars have lost their basis.</p>
<p>The most humorous thing in the three-country alliance is the provision aimed at the relationship with the Soviet Union. It is said that the three countries' relationship with the Soviet Union is not affected by this alliance. Obviously, this is another dose of anesthetic for the Soviet Union. Even if Germany, Italy, and Japan abandon their original so-called "anti-communist" stance, then, just like the United States, under the situation of the three-country alliance on both the east and west sides, the security of the Soviet Union has been fundamentally threatened! It can never remain isolated like this. In the future, the Soviet Union's foreign policy will make seeking alliances a primary goal, while separately easing conflicts with Germany and Italy has become secondary. Under this direction, strengthening aid to China is inevitable; moreover, the so-called "peace diplomacy" that has been advocating for years to prevent the establishment of many enemy countries launching a united attack on itself has also lost its basis for continuing in essence.</p>
<p>Finally, China's attitude towards this alliance has been given a very clear answer by Foreign Minister Wang's remarks the day before yesterday: "The Chinese government and people are determined to continue to strive for a legitimate world order." This is the principle of China's foreign relations. As for all practical measures, of course, they will have to be considered at any time in accordance with future circumstances. This also implies that the attitude that "everyone except the Japanese aggressors is a friend of China" obviously has room for reconsideration.</p>
<h3>Australian Royal Air Force Squadron Reinforces Singapore, Abandons Attempts to Approach Japan, British and American Discussions Continue on Far East Situation</h3>
<p>Singapore - An Australian aircraft squadron has now arrived, greatly increasing the air power in Malaya. According to official reports, this squadron includes new-type bombers and fighters, becoming a major part of the local air force. Malayan defenses are thus strengthened. Australia is supplying Malaya with a large number of pilots and aircraft, so the people of Malaya have more confidence in Malaya's ability to defend itself. (Reuters, 1st)</p>
<p>Singapore - According to news from here today, the defense of Singapore has been enhanced since the arrival of a large Australian reinforcement air force unit, fully entering a state of war. British army officials said that the new air force squadron includes the latest fighters and bombers, arriving from Australia and forming an important part of Malaya's air power. According to a British Royal Air Force official speaking to the United Press reporter, the Australian aviators and air force are of the highest caliber, with exceptionally skilled piloting. The strengthening of Malayan defenses is a clear reaction to the alliance signed by Japan and the Rome-Berlin Axis. Australia's dispatch of its air force also indicates that Australia has abandoned its attempts to approach Japan, and its foreign policy has changed direction. British officials here generally believe that Singapore is prepared and fears no attacks from land or sea. Furthermore, Malaya still has a large number of new troops, and various military constructions have also been expanded on a large scale. (United Press, 1st)</p>
<p>Washington - It is learned here that a squadron of American warships may soon sail to Australia and New Zealand for a friendly visit. The US Navy Department has neither denied nor confirmed this news. However, it is rumored that British government officials have discussed this mission. Secretary of State Hull stated that he has not received definitive information about this planned visit. However, observers quickly pointed out that Hull did not deny this news. According to the news, it is closely related to the recent talks between the British government and Australian representatives regarding promoting closer cooperation between the two countries to prevent Japan from advancing south into the Dutch East Indies and other lands in the Pacific. Yesterday, Secretary of State Hull also discussed the German-Italian-Japanese pact with British Ambassador to the United States, Lord Lothian, for an hour, but the details of the conversation were not disclosed.

<p>American Congressman Suggests to Congress to Re-lease British Territories in the Pacific</p>
<p>Washington - Officials are currently observing the development of the situation in the Far East without comment. However, informed sources believe that the United States' actions in the Far East will depend on the actions taken by Britain regarding the reopening of the Burma Road. The blockade period of the Burma Road will expire on October 17th. Some well-informed politicians say that the United States is not waiting for the reaction between Britain and Japan, but is waiting for the reaction from the Soviet Union. In addition, the United States is waiting for the completion of the report on the issue of controlling other items that may be subject to embargo. Currently, various parties are studying the Soviet Union's newspaper editorials. Many well-informed people believe that even if Soviet officials believe that the agreement between Japan and the Axis powers is a pre-existing fact and do not pay attention to the agreement clearly resisting the United States, this agreement will also be resisted in the event that the situation necessitates it. Some commentators even believe that the German-Italian-Japanese agreement is a revival of the anti-Comintern pact that died last year due to the conclusion of the German-Soviet pact. Washington newspapers still largely pay attention to the development of the situation in the Far East. What they speculate is not only the important relationship of the German-Italian-Japanese agreement, but also whether it is possible for the United States to resist Japan in new ways. Informed sources have recently focused on the activities of the Non-Participation in Japanese Aggression Committee led by former US Asian Fleet Commander Admiral Yarnell. These people say that the United States must never change its policy and Far East policy due to this agreement, or change its determination to maintain its legitimate rights and interests in the Far East.

<h3>Harvard University Faculty Urges to Stop Japanese Aggression, Sends Letter to the US Government to Take Practical Steps, Stop Supplying Japan with War Materials, Expand Aid to China</h3>
<p>Washington - Eleven highly respected faculty members from Harvard University sent a public letter to the Washington Star yesterday, urging the US government to take immediate action to prevent the Japanese from conquering China and the Japanese Navy from controlling the Pacific. Among the eleven, Harvard Law School Dean Landis (transliteration) was also included. They demanded that three practical steps be taken immediately to stop Japanese aggression: (1) Deprive Japan of the supply of raw materials needed for the war as completely as possible; (2) Expand US aid to China; (3) Allow the British and American fleets to share the right to use the Singapore naval base. It is heard that the letter stated, "Japan has been able to dominate the Far East because of the raw materials exported by the United States. Until recently, it has had the intention of absorbing Annam, seizing Siam, and the Dutch East Indies. Thus, Japan is able to proceed to conquer all of Britain's dependencies in the Far East without hindrance. If the Axis countries claim Europe and Japan's control of the Far East is completed, then the economic power of South America may fall into the hands of Germany, Italy, and Japan. This kind of precedent would put the United States in an unimaginable situation. The implementation of the Monroe Doctrine, due to the pressure of the Axis countries on South America and the United States' busy efforts to strengthen its national defense, is now impossible." The letter concluded that the United States can only preemptively take strong and active actions to contain Japan's ambition to annex China and break its dream of dominating the South Pacific.

<p>US to Crack Down on Japanese Fishing Boats</p>
<p>Washington - Yesterday, the US Congress initiated the crackdown on Japanese fishing boats that have been engaged in reconnaissance operations for the Japanese Navy in the waters off California and Hawaii for many years. The House of Representatives has passed a bill and sent it to the Senate. The bill stipulates that all offshore fishing boats will be placed under strict supervision by the US government, and the number of crew members that have been registered as American ships will be subject to nationality restrictions. The bill stipulates that 75% of the personnel on all fishing boats and other ships not subsidized by public funds should be Americans. The remaining number should be either people from the territory, or foreigners who came to the US before July 1, 1930, with legal permission to reside in the US for a long time, or foreigners who resided in the US before 1925 with a good reputation.

<h3>Germany, Italy, and Japan Discuss Setting up a Technical Committee to Formulate Cooperation Plans for Politics and Military, Portuguese Newspaper Believes the Three Countries Threaten the US and the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Tokyo - According to responsible sources, Germany, Italy, and Japan are currently discussing the organization of a joint technical committee in accordance with Article 4 of the alliance. Tokyo and Berlin will set up cooperation plans in the political, economic, and military fields, in order to build a new order in the region, and as a complete part of the new world order. The joint committee also has the right to study the plans for the signatory countries to apply for assistance under Article 3 of the alliance. (Reuters, 1st)</p>
<p>Tokyo - "Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun" carried an article today stating that a joint technical committee will be established in Tokyo and Berlin in the near future to facilitate the implementation of the new three-power pact. The newspaper said that due to the importance of cooperation between Germany and Japan, this committee will be divided into three categories: political, military, and economic. The newspaper predicted, "All outstanding talents" will be appointed to positions on this committee. (United Press, 1st)</p>
<p>Tokyo - Nichi Nichi Shimbun carried an editorial today entitled "The Tripartite Alliance and the Construction of Greater East Asia," stating that the Tripartite Alliance is sufficient to warn the United States not to interfere in the two major wars in the East and West. The Tripartite Alliance is actually most unfavorable to the United States. (Reuters, 1st)</p>
<p>Rome - An Italian official spokesman declared yesterday that the five-way mutual assistance clause stipulated in the German-Italian-Japanese pact is one of the key elements. The spokesman denied the British comments that the Tripartite Pact had no new elements, and denied that the pact was aimed at the United States, or threatened the Soviet Union, listing the German-Soviet, Italian-Soviet, and Soviet-Japanese treaties, and stating that they were not affected by the Tripartite Pact. (Haitong, 1st)</p>
<p>New York - As Italian Foreign Minister Ciano returned to Rome after signing the new three-power alliance, Italian newspapers launched a rhetoric saying that US aid to Britain was an action against the signatories of the Berlin Pact and wanted Japan to immediately join the war. However, the Tokyo government claimed on Saturday that Washington's aid to Britain could not be regarded as the behavior of a belligerent country. From this point of view, there may be disputes among the signatories of this new treaty. Italy desperately needs naval reinforcements in the Mediterranean, because the current Mediterranean is completely controlled by the British fleet, and British troops and military supplies can safely pass through the Mediterranean to Egypt. When Germany and Italy forced the Japanese Navy to provide assistance in the Mediterranean when the war broke out last year, the negotiations soon broke down due to the conclusion of the German-Soviet pact. However, Italy's purpose in signing a new alliance with Japan this time is to obtain Japanese naval assistance. Italy has no other way to destroy British control of the Mediterranean except hoping for Japanese naval assistance. (United Press, 1st)</p>
<p>Lisbon - The Portuguese government's official newspaper, "Manhã" (Morning), published an editorial on September 29, stating that although the German-Italian-Japanese alliance pact had a separate statement to the Soviet Union, the pact was primarily aimed at the United States, and secondly at the Soviet Union. Germany's dispatch of troops to Finland is a threat to the Soviet Union. Now that Germany has obtained Japan's cooperation, it is ready to deal with the Baltic Sea issue. Stalin will see that the Soviet Union's westward advance must end. Arab newspapers commented on the pact, stating that Hitler is now trying hard to find new allies. In view of the failure to attack Britain, he has no choice but to bind the United States' hands, so that it pays attention to the Pacific and has no time to take care of Europe. Furthermore, Hitler and Mussolini are now reckless and do not know how to help Japan, and some newspapers regard the pact as a kind of German-Italian propaganda. (Reuters, 1st)</p>
<h3>Japan Sets Naval Review for Today, Tokyo's Air Defenses Weak</h3>
<p>Tokyo - To celebrate the 2600th anniversary of the founding of Japan, the Japanese Navy recently announced that it will hold a special naval review on the Yokohama sea on October 2.

His original position was succeeded by Major General Ogawa. (United Press, 1st)</p>
<p>Tokyo - According to officials here, "enemy" bombers can break into Japan's anti-aircraft artillery defense line without fighter escorts and cause Tokyo to suffer tragic military bombings, causing significant damage to Tokyo's important military facilities.

<p>Shimla - The Indian Governor sent a letter to Gandhi, leader of the All-India National Congress Party, stating that for the benefit of India, he could not tolerate the freedom of speech requested by the National Congress Party interfering with the war effort. Gandhi replied that the National Congress Party did not want to hinder the government's war effort, but could not deny the party's beliefs at this critical juncture in human destiny. If the National Congress Party had to die, it would die in the act of declaring its beliefs. "We cannot compromise on the point of freedom of speech, believing that the government can properly formulate its policies in the spirit of the National Congress Party's position," In the correspondence between the Indian Governor and Gandhi, it is known that Gandhi stated during the conversation that he did not intend to speak to factory workers, persuading them not to manufacture war equipment, but that National Congress Party members and non-party members should be free to persuade the people not to support India's war effort in any way that would involve India in bloodshed.

<h3>Spanish Interior Minister Suñer Met with Mussolini Yesterday, Developments in the Spanish Situation Expected, Plan to Re-divide Africa is Being Drafted</h3>
<p>Rome - Italian Prime Minister Mussolini met with Spanish Interior Minister Suñer today for talks that lasted for an hour and a half. Foreign Minister Ciano was also present. After the meeting, Ciano held a banquet to welcome him. (Haitong, 1st)</p>
<p>Rome - Spanish Interior Minister Suñer arrived here at 10:00 this morning. Italian Foreign Minister Ciano, senior officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Spanish Ambassador to Italy Cassia, Spanish Ambassador to the Holy See Mesia, German Ambassador to Italy Mackensen, and Spanish Falange groups were at the station to welcome him. (Haitong, 1st)</p>
<p>Berlin - A foreign reporter asked an official spokesman here whether the visit of the Spanish Interior Minister to Rome, concerning politics and diplomacy, would result in something. The spokesman replied that no predictions could be made at this time, but that our diplomatic slogan was "Work makes life pleasant." (Haitong, 1st)</p>
<p>Clermont-Ferrand, France - Regarding the visit of Spanish Interior Minister Suñer to Germany, French newspapers believe that its significance is almost the same as the establishment of a military alliance between Germany, Italy, and Japan. The newspapers used headlines such as "The Important Period of Spain," "Spain and the Axis Powers," and "Spain's Cooperation with the Axis Powers." (Havas, 30th)</p>
<p>Madrid - It is believed that Spanish Interior Minister Suñer's visit to Rome is only a courtesy visit, because major talks in Berlin must have already ended. Suñer is the brother-in-law of General Franco, and it is widely believed that he is very friendly to Rome. (Reuters, 1st)</p>
<p>Vichy - Regarding the development of the political situation in Spain, French newspapers detailed that Spain is now at the eve of deciding on an important national policy. "Paris-Soir" (Paris Evening) stated that Spain is expressing its true position on the current war, and its goal is to occupy Gibraltar. The talks between Spanish Interior Minister Suñer and the Axis powers will make a final decision. "Le Temps" (The Times) stated that Spanish leaders are eager to participate in international politics and fulfill their responsibilities in the Mediterranean and Europe. (Haitong, 1st)</p>
<p>Madrid - The Spanish "Pueblo" (People) newspaper's Rome correspondent, Grant, reported last night that the current question raised by all sectors in Rome is why Suñer still needs to hold meetings in Rome after having several lengthy talks with Hitler, Ribbentrop, and Italian Foreign Minister Ciano in Berlin. The correspondent said that if we understand Spain's traditional friendly relations with Italy, the question will be easy to answer. Suñer's visit to Rome is a further proof of the deep-rooted political friendship between Italy and Spain. As for the talks in Berlin, they will be announced after Suñer returns to the country. Currently, Spain's position and attitude towards the European war have not changed. What can be said is that the plan for Spain's close cooperation with the Axis powers in diplomatic politics has been laid. This plan will have to be changed in the future, which cannot be said now, but it is certain that Spain will be a part of the political construction planned by the totalitarian countries and participate in the reorganization of Europe.

<p>Rome - Yesterday, the International News Service learned that Germany and Italy intend to combine with the Soviet Union and Spain to build a new order in Europe, Africa, and Asia, unless Britain quickly surrenders. The reporter received this report when Italian Foreign Minister Ciano and Spanish Interior Minister Suñer were departing from Berlin to come here. It is said that Britain will have a last chance to accept a compromise peace plan. According to the plan, the territory and spheres of influence in Africa must be re-divided. This plan will be drafted after Suñer arrives in Rome. At the same time, it was also heard that the Rome radio station warned Gibraltar that its British Mediterranean fortress would not last many days. (International, 1st)</p>

<h3>Romania and Bulgaria Withdraw from the Balkan Entente, Cooperation with Turkey Stops</h3>
<p>Sofia - According to Bulgarian newspapers last night, Romania officially notified Turkey, Greece, and Yugoslavia yesterday of its withdrawal from the Balkan Entente. Various circles in Bulgaria have paid close attention to this, and various newspapers have written articles commenting on it. "Mir" (Peace) stated that the Balkan Entente has long been ineffective, and Romania's formal announcement of its withdrawal can be seen in the future direction of Romanian foreign policy. The original purpose of the Entente was to deal with Bulgaria, and now that the issue of Dobruja has been resolved, Romania has no need to participate in the Entente. "Slovo" (Word) stated that it is hoped that other countries can follow Romania's lead and withdraw from this harmful Balkan Entente. As for the new Balkan Pact recently promoted by Turkey, it should be established only when various countries participate as a whole and sincerely resolve the various outstanding issues in the Balkans. (Haitong, 1st)</p>
<p>Capital of Yugoslavia - Yugoslavia also broke away from its former ally Turkey yesterday when it withdrew from the Balkan Entente, because it signed an alliance with Britain. It is also true in fact and in law that Rumania has withdrawn from the Balkan Entente. Regarding the rumor in Turkey that the Balkan Entente countries will hold an economic conference in Athens, well-informed sources in the capital of Yugoslavia said that the Balkan Entente no longer exists in fact. Since Turkey abandoned its policy of neutrality and signed a public agreement with Britain, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Maromania declared that all regional agreements no longer exist, which is the only formal declaration on this situation. At present, it is declared here that Yugoslavia has the same views as the Romanian Minister of Foreign Affairs, so there is no need to cooperate with Turkey, and there is no so-called economic conference of the Balkan Entente countries.

<h3>British Government Will Move to India If Defeated - Remarks by American Brigadier General Barrow</h3>
<p>New York – Former President of the University of California, Brigadier General Barrow, recently stated that, in his observation, if the German army defeats Britain, the British government will move to India in order to continue governing the British Empire, and will definitely not move to Canada as generally expected. He also believes that once Britain moves to India, the United States will engage in the defense of the Western Hemisphere with the assistance of Canada. At this time, the US fleet will be concentrated in the Atlantic, while the British fleet will be fighting in the waters of Singapore and Ceylon. Barrow also said that this is just a hypothetical situation expected after Britain's failure, but he firmly hopes that Britain will not be defeated and that its government will not relocate its capital. However, when the Germans launch the most intense and cruel attack, the British government will inevitably retreat. If Britain is convinced that the United States can defend Canada, the Atlantic, and the West Indies, then increasing the fleet in the Atlantic will be deemed unnecessary.

<h3>An Overview of America’s War Preparations</h3>
<p>— Translated from The New York Times</p>
<p>The United States is currently undertaking its first truly massive military expansion plan since the last World War. On May 16th, when Germany attacked France and Belgium with overwhelming force, President Roosevelt appeared before Congress and warned the nation that "the United States must defend the Western Hemisphere from the control, aggression, and domination of other countries," and requested Congress to appropriate $1,182,000,000 for strengthening national defense. After Germany achieved victories everywhere, President Roosevelt sent another message to Congress on May 31st, requesting military spending. By July 10th, President Roosevelt viewed Germany's victory as "the greatest danger to democracy," and Congress requested a third, extremely large amount of national defense funding. This special funding, plus the regular national defense spending for the 1941 fiscal year, totals an unprecedented $10 billion.</p>
<p>In addition, Congress passed a bill authorizing the President to build a two-ocean navy, nearly doubling the strength of the US Navy, at an estimated cost of another $10 billion.</p>
<p>Therefore, since January 1st of this year, the total amount of national defense spending has reached the astonishing figure of $20 billion, most of which can be used after May 16th. When President Roosevelt began requesting special funding to carry out the unprecedented American defense plan, the US Army and Navy were already in the process of modernization and strengthening.</p>
<p>The current US Navy is already one of the most powerful in the world. Only the British Navy exceeds the US in tonnage, but in terms of actual combat capability, the US also surpasses Britain. The US Army has fewer personnel than other countries (a total of 242,000 officers and soldiers), and its training and equipment are also poor, but the reorganization of the US Army and modern weapons can be prepared immediately. The US Air Force is also relatively small, with the Navy having only 1,765 aircraft and the Army having only 2,800 aircraft.</p>
<p>Naval and army airfields are already under construction, and communication lines between the continental US and its overseas islands have also been greatly improved. Plans to rush-produce modern military equipment have long been underway. When President Roosevelt appeared before Congress on May 16th, there were already 448 three-inch anti-aircraft guns, over one million Springfield rifles, 38,000 semi-automatic rifles, 1.7 billion .30 caliber bullets, and 410,700 gas masks.</p>
<p>But before May 16th, the United States was not completely unprepared, and the Army and Navy were shocked by Germany's victory, believing that the victory was enough to affect the United States, and had to take precautionary measures. The United States does not have the strength of Germany in terms of land and air equipment, and if Germany has the opportunity to seize the British fleet and European shipyards, it is enough to make the current naval balance lose its equilibrium, and together with Japan or Italy, it is enough to occupy an invincible force at sea.</p>
<p>Therefore, from the perspective of both combat strength and foreign events, the United States really needs to accelerate its progress. This is why the United States suddenly demanded an unprecedented defense force, more warships, more aircraft, more guns, and more soldiers. The defense plan is also constantly changing, gradually rationalizing it into a systematic and precise organization. If the past was a period of planning, then the future will be a period of implementation. In terms of current achievements, the following items have already been achieved:</p>
<p>(1) Over $5 billion in national defense funds have already been allocated and are currently available for use. Another $5 billion in funding has also been submitted to Congress for approval; increasing the fleet tonnage by 70 percent has also been approved for implementation.</p>
<p>(2) The Army and Navy have changed their previous defense plans and can formulate basic defense plans and use defense funds.</p>
<p>(3) In order to assist in munitions manufacturing and prevent idleness, President Roosevelt has established a National Defense Advisory Commission, with the President serving as chairman and industry giants Knudsen and Stettinius as members.</p>
<p>The American defense plan seeks to cope with everything, so it is still difficult to determine the fundamental defense policy of the Army and Navy. The defense of the Western Hemisphere is one of the most obvious goals, but the necessary conditions for the defense of the Western Hemisphere require obtaining bases outside the continental United States and its overseas territories. Negotiations on leasing bases in South America are underway in secret, but the actual acquisition of lease rights for Trinidad and the Galapagos Islands has not yet been realized. (Translator's note: These two islands have now been leased to the United States by Britain.)</p>
<p>Other military plans, so far, can be said to involve both the Army and Navy.</p>
<p>In terms of the Navy: (1) From 1946 to 1949, the tonnage of the naval fleet should increase by 70 percent compared to the present. For example, the number of battleships should increase from the current 15 to 35.</p>
<p>(2) By 1946, the number of naval personnel should increase from the current 145,000 to 400,000. In the current fiscal year, it should increase to 190,000, and in the 1942 fiscal year, it should increase to 215,000 or 260,000.</p>
<p>(3) It is planned to complete naval bases and their equipment, as well as air force bases, within the continental United States and its territories around June 1942, and to increase shipbuilding equipment.</p>
<p>(4) By 1946, when 70 percent of the naval tonnage is completed, the current 2,000 naval aircraft must be increased to 3,500. By April 1942, the number of naval aircraft should increase from 7,000 to 8,000.</p>
<p>Various situations of America’s expanding preparation.</p>
<p>In terms of the Army: (1) This September, the US regular army will increase to 375,000 men. The National Guard can only summon four divisions this year. The current strength of the National Guard is 2.4 million officers and soldiers. Starting on September 1st, the monthly salary for each new recruit is set at eleven dollars, and training will require at least fifteen months, so that the National Guard and the Army can reach 1.2 million or even 2 million men.</p>
<p>(2) By April 1942, the number of Army aircraft will increase from the current 3,000 to 36,500.</p>
<p>(3) From October 1931 to June 1932, the US Army of 1.2 million men will be fully equipped with modern weapons, while the other 800,000 men will be equipped with various major weapons.</p>
<p>(4) By April 1942, specialized modern mechanized units will be formed.</p>
<p>In terms of domestic military construction: (2) By April 194, the domestic aircraft production industry must increase its production volume by more than five to six times, that is, from the current monthly production of 700 aircraft and 1,400 engines to an annual production of 40,000 aircraft and 100,000 engines. In other words, the Army and Navy can ultimately have 50,000 aircraft.</p>
<p>(2) With government subsidies or assistance, or private investment, build a large number of gunpowder factories and manufacturing bureaus within eight or fifteen months for mass production of military equipment.</p>
<p>(3) Build a large number of storage facilities to store military raw materials.</p>
<p>(4) Form domestic defense forces, anti-aircraft gun units, and other units.</p>
<p>(5) Complete this task as soon as possible without hindering the conditions of the national economic life.</p>
<p>In terms of manufacturing military equipment and accelerating factory production, it is now limited to a small number of funds that can be used as a construction military plan. The Navy Department took a portion of the 1931 fiscal year funds and entered into a contract with an aircraft factory to build 1,200 aircraft. Although the Army aircraft orders have not yet been separately contracted, the manufacturing in process is worth $60 million to $66 million, and there are also $18.3 million worth of military equipment materials being prepared. Other large-scale military equipment manufacturing cooperation, stipulating delivery six months, eight months, ten months, or fifteen months later, was also completed in mid-July and will be ready by this autumn.</p>
<p>Although the Knudsen Committee has not been established for long, it has already ordered $1 billion worth of military equipment. Several serious industrial problems have also been resolved.</p>

<h3>London Implements New Air Defense System - German Aircraft Groups Fail to Attack - Air Raid Lasted Twelve Hours the Night Before - Suffered Many Losses After Being Intercepted by British Air Force</h3>
<p>London - From dusk on Monday to dawn on Tuesday, German aircraft continuously bombed London for twelve hours, setting the longest record since the start of the war. During these twelve hours, London's new air defense system underwent rigorous testing. Officials said that although London was bombed in twenty-seven places, the strengthened defense was extremely satisfactory. The gaps in the anti-aircraft gun positions have been filled by the new system. The artificial lightning invented by British engineers not only scared many German aircraft but also illuminated them for British gun positions to shoot at. (1st day, International News Agency telegram)</p>
<p>Berlin - The German military department recently announced that the fourth week of retaliatory bombing by Germany began on Sunday night. The German Air Force extended its military operations to Scotland, 1,000 kilometers away from the air force base. The ports of Aberdeen, Edinburgh, and Leith were all attacked. On Sunday night, the two major ports of London and Liverpool suffered heavy damage. On Monday, the squadron led by Lieutenant Böettler bombed the Mirrlees munitions factory at low altitude.

<p>British Secret Weapon, Air Mines, Appear Over London</p>
<p>London - Last night, the British new air defense system was successfully implemented. In the skies of London, fire and light leaped everywhere, like lightning, and even more like fireworks welcoming the German aircraft. The British "air mines" and other secret weapons were very effective, so that the hundreds of German aircraft rushing to Britain were reduced to very few upon arrival in London. After four attacks, the German aircraft were only able to drop incendiary bombs in the center of London and high-explosive bombs in the northwest suburbs. The British Air Ministry announced that the British new "lightning" gun positions shot down 43 German aircraft, setting an unprecedented record. Although the British aircraft also lost sixteen aircraft, eight pilots were rescued. Near midnight, six bombs fell on the northwest suburbs of London, and several houses were destroyed. (1st day, International News Agency telegram)</p>
<p>Fierce Air Battles Occur Along the British Coast</p>
<p>London - The Air Ministry News Office said that yesterday the German Air Force attacked the southeast and Bristol areas of Britain six times, all of which were intercepted, causing the enemy aircraft to fail to find targets to drop bombs. According to the Air Ministry bulletin, 47 enemy aircraft were shot down in air battles yesterday, one of which was shot down by anti-aircraft fire. British fighter planes lost 23 aircraft, but 12 pilots were safe. Before dusk yesterday, German aircraft flew over the coasts of Kent, Sussex, and Dorset in three groups at the same time and were dispersed by British fighter planes, dropping a few bombs. A town in Dorset and a town in the Thames River area were hit, suffering slight losses, with slight casualties. Damage elsewhere was minor. In the afternoon, a German aircraft sneaked to a town in Suffolk and dropped bombs, damaging some houses, but there were reportedly very few casualties. Yesterday morning, German aircraft attacked London twice, with the intention of diverting attention and consuming British fighter planes. Then, 70 enemy bombers and fighters, after crossing the coast between St. Alban's Head and Portland, flew to the skies of Dorset and Somerset and formed a fan shape, trying to flee west. Before long, there were German aircraft attacking London again, the first batch being 120 and the second batch being 200-300. However, only a few German aircraft sneaked into London and finally turned to Portland and Bristol to wreak havoc. Last night, when German aircraft attacked eastern Britain, a Messerschmitt German fighter plane was accidentally shot down by its teammates and crashed to the ground. Another Messerschmitt German fighter plane dived straight down and failed to return up, causing it to crash in Windsor Park. At noon, when German aircraft attacked the southeast, a fierce battle broke out. Twenty Dornier Do 17 bombers were protected by 50-60 Messerschmitt fighters. Several teams of British Spitfire fighters fought against them. One team passed through the German fighter groups and dispersed the leading bomber group. Another Spitfire British aircraft fought with the German fighters and must have shot down six of them. In the afternoon, several Junkers Ju 88 aircraft attacked the west and were repelled by the Spitfire British aircraft, and four were shot down into the sea. A Polish aircraft team also participated in this battle. Since joining the British Air Force, the team has destroyed over a hundred enemy aircraft. (1st day, Reuters telegram)</p>
<p>London - According to announcements from the Air Ministry and the Ministry of Internal Security, from dawn to afternoon yesterday, German aircraft launched four major attacks on southern and southeastern regions of Britain. British fighter planes and anti-aircraft gun defenses continuously intercepted them. The last two batches of attacking German aircraft crossed the coast near Dover between 9:00 AM and 10:15 AM and sneaked in for 40 miles, but did not reach London. They dropped bombs on several places such as Bexhill and Hastings in the southeast region, causing slight material and life losses. About an hour later, when the third batch of enemy aircraft flew over the Dorset coast, they were intercepted by British aircraft. Only a few bombers sneaked inland. The fourth attack was larger in scale. Just after 1:00 PM, 180 enemy aircraft flew over Dungeness and sneaked inland again. Before reaching the outskirts of London, they were dispersed. Only a few enemy aircraft took the opportunity to sneak into the western suburbs and dropped bombs, causing material damage and slight casualties. (1st day, Reuters telegram)</p>
<h3>British Aircraft Widely Attack German Military Bases, Around Thirty Locations Attacked, Calais Area Ablaze</h3>
<p>London – The night before last and yesterday morning, British bombers launched extremely fierce and extensive attacks on German targets. Upon completion of the missions, the ground was ablaze for hundreds of miles. Thirty German locations and occupied territories were attacked by British aircraft, including bases used for the invasion of England along the Dutch and French coasts. The naval base at Lorient, heavily damaged in a major attack last week, was subjected to a third fierce bombardment. Although British air activity was hampered by poor visibility, it was observed that large bombs hit the German long-range gun emplacements at Cap Gris-Nez, which did not escape damage. High-explosive shells fell and exploded near the gun positions. (Reuters, 1st)</p>
<p>London – According to details of the attacks released by the Air Ministry's Information Office, British aircraft fiercely attacked railways in Mannheim and Koblenz, among other places. Goods depots in Koblenz and other locations were bombed and set on fire, and in Hamm, a large bomb fell along the side of a goods depot, causing two fires. An oil refinery in Hanover was bombed at nearly 11 o'clock in the afternoon, causing a large fire. Twenty minutes later, as the last British aircraft left the area, the flames were still rising high. A factory near Hanover was bombed, causing continuous explosions. A factory in Dortmund was also bombed and set on fire. British aircraft flying towards the Netherlands attacked the Fokker aircraft factory near Amsterdam, which is located in the shipyards and is now being used by the invading German forces. This facility was heavily bombed by British aircraft, and factory buildings and dockyards at its southern end were seen on fire and exploding. In addition, five airfields including Schiphol were also subjected to heavy night bombing by British heavy bombers. Schiphol is Amsterdam's main airport, and it was hit and set on fire, while the aircraft airfield at Alkmaar was engulfed in flames. British aircraft attacking Calais faced fierce resistance from the port's gun batteries, but bombs hit multiple sections of the dockyard area. Other British bombers attacked the outer harbor and newly built tidal port of Ostend, as well as the main docking basin of Boulogne, causing significant damage. A brief Air Ministry statement described British aircraft's fierce attacks on German oil refineries, aircraft and munitions factories, railway communications, airfields, and Channel ports, stating that the RAF continues to fly nightly over German ports and estuaries to lay mines. Three British aircraft did not return. Yesterday, two Blenheim British bombers engaged and shot down two German bombers over the North Sea. (Reuters, 1st)</p>
<p>London – Last night, British forces again heavily bombed German bases preparing for the invasion of England. The explosions were heard far along the Kent coast, and houses shook. After the bombs exploded, the sky was ablaze, and even the sea off Dover reflected a reddish glow. British aircraft bombing clearly targeted the harbor of Calais and the long-range gun emplacements near Cap Gris-Nez, which appeared to be in flames. German land-based gun batteries returned heavy fire. (Reuters, 1st)</p>
<h3>German Air Force Strength Suffers Great Blow, Observation by a Prominent British Figure</h3>
<p>London – According to a Reuters Air Force correspondent, a senior British Air Force official stated today that the loss of over a thousand German aircraft and five thousand pilots in August and September represents a very significant blow to the front-line strength of the German Air Force. The losses suffered by the German Air Force after the destruction in Poland have been the greatest during the air battle over Britain. The impact of this is currently unknown, but the fact that the enemy's invasion plans have not progressed favorably to date confirms the damage their air force has sustained. The British Air Force is well aware that the German High Command aims for the invasion of England as its operational objective. The Germans initially used their air force to infiltrate England, with airfields as the primary targets of attack, clearly intending to destroy the RAF's ability to resist. Later, they launched air raids on London, hoping to create chaos and seize the opportunity to invade Britain. However, these fierce attacks over the past two months have all failed. The German High Command is now facing an increasingly serious problem, namely, how to maintain aerial superiority in terms of both numbers and capability. If this problem is not resolved, Germany will not be able to effectively invade Britain, nor will it be able to inflict any genuinely significant damage on key British areas that are heavily protected by aircraft, artillery, and barrage balloons. (Reuters, 1st)</p>
<p>London – In the week ending on the night of September 28, 222 German aircraft were confirmed lost in the air battle over Britain, not including destroyed or damaged aircraft that have not been verified by the Air Ministry. During the same period, Britain lost 69 aircraft, but 37 pilots were unharmed. It is estimated that the enemy's pilot losses during this week totaled approximately 555. (Reuters, 1st)</p>

<h3>Random Notes on the European War (10) (5) Germany's New Military Science</h3>
<p>On the eve of the German invasion, Poland had a territory spanning over 150,000 square miles and a population of 25 million. Although most Poles were impoverished, they were very patriotic and, in the past, possessed a militaristic ethos. Unfortunately, non-Polish ethnicities accounted for about 40% of their population. Farmers speaking Russian dialects, accounting for 30%, tilled the lands of Polish officials and landlords in the eastern provinces. Due to historical, cultural, and religious differences – one side Catholic, the other Greek Orthodox – there was an invisible divide between them. Jews accounted for another 5%, and Germans another 5%.</p>
<p>The Polish army ranked fourth or fifth among European nations. Broadly speaking, they were old-style armies from the 1914-1918 era, supplemented by large numbers of cavalry. They had a total of 30 infantry divisions, 12 cavalry brigades, and 1 mechanized brigade. The air force was very weak. Soldiers and junior officers were excellent, but the quality of senior generals was difficult to assess.</p>
<p>Geographically, Poland was difficult to defend. From the Carpathian Mountains in the south to the Baltic Sea in the north, the entire territory was a plain with only a few rivers serving as important military barriers. The borders of Germany and its smaller ally Slovakia bordered three-quarters of Poland's border, forming a large, circular encirclement line. However, Polish military authorities concentrated 500,000 troops to defend this geographically unfavorable western border. The objective was either to defeat the majority of German forces or to hope that Britain and France would launch an offensive on the Western Front, or at least send aircraft to assist Poland.</p>
<p>The German plan was to take a defensive stance on the Western Front, using 11 divisions and a smaller number of reserves to strictly guard the Siegfried Line. On the Eastern Front, 50 regular divisions and 10 reserve divisions, totaling 1 million men, were concentrated to attack Poland. The entire German force was concentrated on the northern and southern flanks. Only a very small number of troops remained in the center, under the assumption that the Polish army would have no time to attack the center. German armored divisions were initially used as reserves.</p>
<p>At dawn on September 1, 1939, German land and air forces suddenly attacked without declaring war. According to reports, over 2,000 aircraft of all types were used in the operation. All airfields and aircraft factories clearly identified by the Germans were bombed. Many Polish aircraft were destroyed on the ground before they could take off. Within two days, the entire Polish Air Force lost its combat effectiveness. German aircraft then turned to bombing Polish railways, and finally, Polish troops.</p>
<p>At the same time, the German army advanced rapidly. In the first four days, the southern end of the Polish "Corridor" in the north had been cut off by German forces. In the south, the industrial region of Upper Silesia was also occupied by German forces in a pincer movement, without firing a shot. Southwest of Warsaw, Polish forces gradually retreated, and the line of defense began to be breached by German forces. The German army's astonishing mechanized units then followed up, making their combat debut. On September 7 and 8, the German army's powerful mechanized units advanced northeastward along Poland's only remaining intact highway for 80 miles, reaching the outskirts of Warsaw. If the German army could hold this narrow salient, the Polish army's main force in the center, almost half of the Polish combat troops, who were still in the far west near the German border, would be in a dire situation, facing the risk of being captured. Their air communications had been cut off, and unless they broke through the German lines, which had suddenly been established as if by magic, there was virtually no safe way to retreat. Meanwhile, the Polish forces north of Warsaw, defending along the Narew River, repelled several German attacks, but were eventually breached.</p>
<p>Later, the Polish central army attempted to break through the German lines, and the intensity of the fighting was unprecedented in the entire campaign. At one point, a German position was in a very dangerous situation, but although the German line was forced to retreat, it was not broken. The German army then concentrated a large number of aircraft for bombing and used many transport vehicles to bring in large reinforcements, preventing the Polish advance eastward. By September 20, the encircled Polish central army, numbering 170,000 men, equipped with 300 cannons and 40 tanks, had to surrender to the Germans.</p>
<p>Before the war west of Warsaw ended, a second German mechanized force was advancing simultaneously further south, achieving equally astonishing results. This second mechanized force advanced over 100 miles, cutting off communication with large numbers of Polish troops northeast of Krakow and in the Lysogory Mountains west of the Vistula River, preventing them from retreating and waiting for German infantry to arrive and eliminate them. By September 13, 60,000 officers and men, 143 cannons, and 38 tanks in this area had surrendered to the Germans.</p>
<p>Finally, the German extreme left flank crossed the Narew River on September 7, and then, on September 12, advanced southward with its mechanized forces for over 100 miles, reaching the city of Brest-Litovsk. On the evening of the 14th, it occupied the city's old fortress. On the same day, the German southern route, i.e., the extreme right flank's mechanized forces, surrounded Lviv on three sides. Three days later, German armored vehicles and motorcycle teams advanced northward from Lviv for about 150 miles, linking up with the mechanized forces south of Brest-Litovsk, 50 miles away.</p>
<p>At this stage, the Polish war was virtually over. Soviet troops then entered from the east, encountering no organized resistance from Polish forces. The heroic resistance of the soldiers and civilians of Warsaw only prolonged the end of the war by a few days.</p>
<p>Regarding the losses on both sides, according to German claims, 750,000 Polish soldiers were captured, and German casualties were 10,000 killed, 30,000 wounded, and 3,000 missing. Even if these figures, like other German announcements, were fabricated, there is no doubt that the Blitzkrieg of last September resulted in little German bloodshed.</p>
<p>The Norwegian campaign was the second excellent experiment in the German army's new tactics. The situation in Norway was completely different from that in Poland, but German generals applied the same principles of Blitzkrieg to address the current problems and achieved a second astonishing success.</p>
<p>Norway is a mountainous region with rugged coastlines and a sparse population. For centuries, there have been no major wars. The Norwegian army is little more than a poorly trained militia. Most of the population, although renowned as brave sailors, lack a warrior spirit. On the other hand, the country has access to the sea, allowing it to receive assistance from Britain and France.</p>
<p>As in the Polish campaign, the German invasion of Norway initially employed deception. The first general offensive occurred on April 9 and was jointly conducted by aircraft, warships, transport ships, and soldiers who had infiltrated Norwegian ports on merchant ships. Overnight, the Norwegian capital Oslo, major seaports, airfields, and the headquarters of five of the six Norwegian army divisions were occupied by German forces. The initial number of German troops sent to Norway was very small. A week later, according to official American estimates, the number of German personnel was only 18,000, half of whom were stationed in Oslo, with the others scattered in various locations, forming small, isolated units that were completely cut off from each other except for air support. However, Norwegian resistance was very weak, and as a result, a small number of German troops eventually caused the entire country to fall apart, with the exception of the port of Narvik. It was rumored that a small number of German troops, traveling in four transport vehicles, penetrated deep into the Norwegian interior, attempting to capture the elderly Norwegian king. Fortunately, some farmers blocked the road with carts, saving the king from capture. Most of the Norwegian reservists did not answer the call to enlist. Although the destruction of roads and bridges could have hindered German land operations, the Norwegians did not do much to implement sabotage. The small number of British and French forces who landed in central Norway sent troops 100 miles into the country, but German intensive bombing air force and enveloping mechanized unit, attacked from up and down sides like on the Polish plain. As a result, the Allied British and French forces had no choice but to retreat to the warships. From situation across the country, the German aerial transport planes were well coordinated.</p>
<p>A month after invading the Scandinavian Peninsula, the Germans launched a major invasion of the Netherlands, Belgium, and northern France. This was the German army's third implementation of the Blitzkrieg.</p>
<p>Although the details of this war are still unknown, reviewing the map and exploring each stage of the German army's advance can once again prove that the German army's new tactics are capable of adapting to every specific situation. On the fifth day of the invasion, the Dutch army surrendered. By the twelfth day, the German army had crossed most of Belgium and victoriously advanced into France.</p>
<p>The use of parachute troops emerged in a brand-new form in this campaign. In Belgium, the aircraft were said to have been completely [illegible characters] bombed before taking off, just like the Polish Air Force.</p>
<p>From the above, we can draw two conclusions. First, the German army is not technically superhuman, but very competent. The German army has always maintained the fighting spirit of Prussia. Prussians can also fulfill their obligations to sacrifice themselves to the utmost, and their sense of responsibility far exceeds that of other countries.</p>
<p>Second, the German army has absolutely proven that the essence of new tactics lies not only in the use of new weapons but also in training elite troops and allowing capable generals to use new weapons. The secret of the German army's success lies in this. (End)</p>

<h3>Yesterday's All-Day Gale and Torrential Rain Turned Shanghai into a Water Kingdom; Pacific Hurricane Landed in Fuzhou; Jianghai Customs Signal Tower Issued Black Ball Warning; Racecourse Was a Sea of Waves, and Avenue Joffre Was Splashed with Waves</h3>
<p>From 9 a.m. yesterday, Shanghai experienced heavy rain. According to the observatory, the rainfall from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. was 88.7 millimeters, equivalent to 3.49 inches. The intensity of the downpour was evident. The rain did not stop in the evening, and another torrential downpour occurred at midnight. Coupled with the high tide of the Huangpu River and a simultaneous northern strike of a Pacific hurricane, the wind and rain combined to turn the entire city into a swamp.</p>
<p>Customs Warning</p>
<p>Yesterday, inquiries made at the Xujiahui Observatory revealed that the Pacific hurricane had reached 27.30 degrees north latitude and 18.30 degrees east longitude, heading north and had already landed in the north-northwest of Fuzhou. Starting at 10 a.m. yesterday, Jianghai Customs immediately hoisted a black ball on top of the signal tower on the Bund, indicating that the hurricane was within 100 miles. In the evening, a red light was hung to warn all ships sailing. The ships on the Yangtze River line sailed as usual because their departure time was very early, and they did not receive the customs report. However, as the wind became stronger in the afternoon, they could not return and all took shelter in safe areas.</p>
<p>Several Feet Deep</p>
<p>Since 4 p.m. the day before yesterday, there had been drizzling rain that did not stop until night. Yesterday morning, the rainfall gradually increased. At noon, the ground was lower along the section of Avenue de la Gare in the French Concession from the East New Bridge to the West New Bridge, and the water accumulated to a height of three feet. All trams on routes 2, 7, and 10 traveling on this road were obstructed by the overflowing rain and temporarily stopped on the tracks at that location. Vehicles coming from Lujiawan and Xujiahui heading east also stopped on Avenue Joffre because the area west of Songshan Road was flooded. Other vehicles were also unable to proceed, and traffic there was blocked.</p>
<p>Road Water Levels</p>
<p>In the French Concession, water accumulated to a depth of three or four feet in areas around Route d'Alber, Route Mercier, and Route Paul Beau. The water in the vegetable market and Rue des Villas reached a height of one and a half feet. In low-lying areas around Route Ferguson to Route Songshan, the water accumulated to about two feet. The southern section of Route Ratard had about one foot of accumulated water. In the International Settlement, the water depth reached the ankles at places such as Muirhead Road, Thongue Road, Foochow Road, Rue du Consulat, Connaught Road, and Jiangjiaqiao on the south side of the Gordon Road Police Station, and pedestrians had to walk barefoot. The water accumulated very high in low-lying areas such as Shansi Road, and the water seeped into the residents' homes.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, reporters took rickshaws to inspect the area and saw that the entire racecourse was submerged in water, with surging waves, resembling West Lake, only lacking yachts. From Rue Nanking, starting from Yuqiaqing Road to the Bund, except for a section of Fujian Road and Shilu Road, which were relatively high and not flooded, the rest of the water flowed tortuously, resembling the Yangtze River. Places like Kwangsi Road, Yunnan Road, Chekiang Road, and Swatow Road were like harbors in the river. Patrolmen stood in the water, directing traffic. The surroundings of the Sincere and Sun Sun department stores were also surrounded by water. Hundreds of cars stalled on Avenue Joffre, connected end to end, forming a long snake. Business was unusually sluggish in the bustling areas, and the prices of various vegetables in the morning all rose.</p>
<p>Vehicle Overturns</p>
<p>At about 5 p.m. yesterday, in front of the Park Hotel on Bubbling Well Road, the accumulated water was shin-deep. At that time, a man was riding in a rickshaw passing through the area. The rickshaw puller accidentally lost his balance while trying to avoid a bus, and both the rickshaw and the passenger fell into the accumulated water. The passenger was pressed down by the vehicle and could not get out of the water for a while. With the help of others, he was able to stand up, but he was soaked and swallowed a lot of water.</p>
<p>At about 3 p.m. yesterday, near Route du Consulat and Route Edward VII, a small black-plated car overturned due to the high level of accumulated water. The engine was also damaged as a result. It took many coolies to push it away.</p>
<p>Walls Collapse</p>
<p>Yesterday evening, the rain became even heavier. In the lane opposite the back door of the Grand Theater on Route Pottier, there were several old bungalows. The age of the buildings was too old, and they were eroded by the heavy rain yesterday. A wall in a house at a certain number suddenly collapsed. Fortunately, it was around 6 p.m., and the people in the house were not asleep, so no one was injured. The water accumulated at busy places such as Yuqiaqing Road, Nanjing Road, and Risheng Tower in the International Settlement was deep, so all the major amusement parks and theaters, such as Wing On, Sincere, Sun Sun rooftop garden, China Grand Theatre, and Eastern Theatre, stopped performing in the evening.</p>
<p>The road surface around the Old Gate Police Station on Kwangsi Road was very low, and the accumulated water there almost submerged the knees. Therefore, the storefronts on both sides were washed into the water. There were many photography studios in that area, such as Rose Photography, no fewer than a dozen. All kinds of photographic materials in the stores were corroded by the water, resulting in considerable losses.</p>
<h3>The Establishment of the Special Police in West Shanghai is Undefined</h3>
<p>The issue of establishing a "Special Police Force" in the West Shanghai outside-the-settlement road area has continued after the return of Major Bowman, Chief Superintendent of the Municipal Council, to Shanghai. The number of police stations to be established and the personnel organization, etc., have been largely determined after several consultations. However, the Municipal Council is carefully reviewing the matter and is considering it in detail. The proposed organizational measures and the date of establishment have not yet been determined because they are subject to negotiation. At present, security matters in the area are still maintained by police officers dispatched by the Police Department, together with the White Russian team of the International Volunteer Corps stationed there, who patrol as usual.</p>
<h3>Instability in Hongkew: Another Shooting Occurs; Japanese Naval Officer Shot Again; German Jewish Man Dies Tragically from a Bullet</h3>
<p>The English-language China Press reported that a Japanese army officer was stabbed on Wuchang Road at approximately 10:15 p.m. on the 29th of last month. Within minutes of this incident, another Japanese naval officer was shot and wounded under "mysterious" circumstances.</p>
<p>An Innocent Jewish Man Loses His Life</p>
<p>It is now confirmed that yesterday (the 30th), at 4 p.m., a Japanese Marine Corps sentry on the Hongkew Creek Bridge on Broadway Road stopped a truck for inspection as usual. The truck did not stop, so the Japanese sentry opened fire. However, he accidentally hit a German Jewish immigrant, who died instantly.</p>
<p>Naval Officer Shot</p>
<p>Regarding the Japanese naval officer being shot and wounded under "mysterious" circumstances, and being sent to the Japanese Marine Corps Hospital on Jiangwan Road, a Japanese Navy spokesman this morning "officially acknowledged" the incident, saying that the claim was "merely a rumor." However, according to reporters, a disturbance did occur on the evening of the 29th, and the naval officer was involved and was accidentally shot.</p>
<p>Japanese Newspapers Made No Mention</p>
<p>The details of the Jewish man dying from a bullet are as follows: Yesterday afternoon, a truck carrying several Chinese people was driving across the Hongkew Creek Bridge on Broadway Road when the Japanese sentry opened fire. At that time, a public bus of the Japanese-owned China City Bus Company was passing by. A bullet pierced the bus and struck a Jewish immigrant in the abdomen, who died shortly after. Shanghai's Japanese newspapers remain silent about the continuous shootings in Hongkew in the past two days, likely due to strict prohibitions by the Japanese army and navy authorities from publishing such news.</p>
<p>Another Shooting Acknowledged by Japan</p>
<p>However, it is heard that regarding the shooting of the Japanese army officer on the night of the 29th, Japanese officials have announced that the officer was Major Islbe, 37 years old, who was shot twice from behind by an assassin on his way back to the New Asia Hotel. He was immediately sent to the Shinozaki Hospital on Baumgartner Road. The assassin is believed to have hidden behind a truck at the intersection of Wuchang Road and North Szechuan Road before firing.</p>
<h3>Seemed to be in the Center of the Water</h3>
<p>Yesterday there was a continuous heavy gale and rain, without a moment's stop, suddenly turning Shanghai into a water town. In the past, during heavy rains in this city, only the low-lying areas were submerged in water. Yesterday's rain made even the flat roads in the western district seem to be in the center of the water; viewed from the picture, it resembled Venice in Italy. The picture above shows only part of the scene: (top right) accumulated water at the intersection of Chengtu Road and Jing'an Temple Road (bottom right) the water level gradually rises in the area around Jing'an Temple Road and Pike Road (top left) Nanking Road Sincere Public River (bottom left) waves splashing on Avenue Joffre (Photo by Zhang Hong)</p>
<h3>The French Tram Workers' Strike Was Mediated Once Yesterday; Yu Qiaqing and Others Visited the Company Authorities; An Attempt to Negotiate Did Not Yield Satisfactory Results</h3>
<p>After the workers of the French Tram Company went on strike on September 25, the workers' demands for improved treatment have been delivered to the company and preliminary negotiations have been conducted. However, because the parties have not yet reached an agreement, the issue has been delayed. Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Ludeng, at the request of the workers, went to the company at 11 a.m. yesterday to meet with the manager and try to mediate, but did not achieve a satisfactory resolution.</p>
<p>Attempted Mediation Did Not Achieve a Resolution</p>
<p>After submitting six temporary solutions, the striking workers requested that Yu Qiaqing and Yuan Ludeng, Chinese directors of the Municipal Council, mediate. Yu Qiaqing accepted this request and telephoned the manager of the French Tram Company yesterday morning to explain the workers' request to mediate. The company manager expressed his welcome at that time. Therefore, at 11 a.m., he and Yuan Ludeng went to the company to meet with the manager and left at about 12 p.m. According to the New Voice News reporter, the company welcomed and thanked Yu and Yuan for their mediation, but believed that the company's treatment of workers was quite favorable, with the lowest worker wages being above 70 yuan, and that several decisions had been made to increase rice subsidies, etc. Good workers were unwilling to strike, and this turmoil was completely incited by malicious elements, so a satisfactory resolution was not achieved. However, Yu Qiaqing hopes that the company will seek a reasonable solution quickly.</p>
<p>Public Buses Resume on One Line</p>
<p>In order to maintain traffic within the concession, the French Tram Company dispatched armed police to protect the operation of trams after the workers went on strike. Since yesterday, the number of trams on routes 2, 7, and 10 has been increased to 40. At the same time, efforts were made to restore the operation of public buses and trolleybuses. Yesterday morning, Route 22 public buses from Avenue Edward VII, the Bund to Xujiahui, were first restored, with a total of 13 buses dispatched. However, the route was shortened, from Xujiahui to Rue Saint Marie and Avenue Petain, connecting with routes 2, 9, and 15 of the China General Omnibus Company of the International Settlement. The section from Rue Saint Marie to the Bund is temporarily suspended. As for Route 21 public buses and Routes 17, 18, and 24 trolleybuses, it has been decided to resume operation in the near future.</p>
<h3>Dispute at French Water and Electricity Plant; Workers Strike in the Engine Room</h3>
<p>According to news from the labor side of the French Water and Electricity Company yesterday, at 12 a.m. (the 30th), more than 80 workers in the engine room of the French Water and Electricity Company on Rue Lupan and Route Pichon were working when Mr. Bowleson, a Russian employee of the company, suddenly had a conflict with a worker, resulting in a strike. All 80 workers left the factory at dawn. However, in the afternoon, the water and electricity company authorities agreed to punish Mr. Bowleson, the Russian employee who had the conflict with the workers. All the workers were satisfied and immediately returned to work. The remaining living conditions proposed will be submitted to the capital side during the mediation.</p>
<h3>Danish Consul Hill Resumes Work After Leave</h3>
<p>Danish Consul Hill previously took sick leave due to a sudden illness and was treated at the Country Hospital for a week. It is now known that Mr. Hill has recovered and resumed work yesterday. Relevant parties have been notified.</p>
<p>Miura Arrives in Japan and Goes to Mexico to Take Office</p>
<p>After Miura Yoshiaki, the former Consul-General in Shanghai, left Shanghai on the 17th aboard the ocean liner Taiyo Maru for Japan, a telegram was received in this city stating that he has now arrived in Kobe. After a short stay, he will take a ship to Mexico to take office as a minister.</p>
<h3>Remittances from Overseas Chinese in the United States to China Reach 700 Million Yuan; Statistics for the First Eight and a Half Months of This Year Show a Total of 35 Million U.S. Dollars</h3>
<p>The number of overseas Chinese is very large, spread all over the world. The amount of remittances from overseas Chinese back to China each year is huge, which is of great benefit to China's international balance of payments. Since the outbreak of the all-out war of resistance, overseas Chinese have been motivated by patriotic enthusiasm and actively contributed, with the amount of remittances back to China being even greater than before. This has provided great assistance to the motherland's economy during the war of resistance. According to the latest accurate statistics obtained from the banking sector, for overseas Chinese in the United States alone, from January to the 15th of last month, over the course of eight and a half months, remittances have reached 35 million U.S. dollars, which translates to 700 million yuan in national currency at the current black market exchange rate. Its contribution to the future of the war of resistance and national construction need not be stated further.</p>
<h3>Japanese Have Not Responded to Protest Over Assault on American Sailor; Both Sides Will Conduct a Joint Investigation; All Details Will Be Released After Investigation</h3>
<p>Regarding the case of an American sailor from the flagship USS Augusta being assaulted by Japanese military police "stationed" in the Bank of Communications building at No. 14 The Bund on Saturday (the 28th), according to official sources yesterday morning, the U.S. Navy authorities here are continuing to investigate. Officials of the U.S. Navy's Asiatic Fleet also stated yesterday that they had lodged a protest with the Japanese Navy authorities the day before. It is understood that Admiral Hart, Commander of the Asiatic Fleet at the time, sent a note to Admiral Shimada, Commander of the Japanese Third Fleet, but as of yesterday morning, the U.S. Navy authorities here had not received a reply from the Japanese authorities. Reports yesterday confirmed the details of the assault from reliable sources, but the exact details of the assault and the reasons for the incident are still unknown. It is understood that the U.S. Navy authorities have requested the Japanese authorities to cooperate in investigating the details of the case. At the same time, the U.S. Navy authorities refused to release the name of the sailor involved yesterday morning, stating that details of the case would be released after the investigation by both sides is completed.</p>
<h3>Evaluation Committee Met Yesterday; Rice Price Still Not Evaluated; Representatives Pushed to Visit Authorities to Detail Difficulties; Rumor Has It that Authorities Approved a Second Evaluation Based on Production Price</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Rice Evaluation Committee was officially established on July 5 this year under the leadership of the authorities of the two concessions, it has been more than two months. It has repeatedly decided to evaluate the highest market price of foreign rice and announced its implementation in the market on the day of the decision, but the rice price has continued to rise frequently, and black market trading has sprung up. The committee has recognized its inability to cope and requested guidance and practical assistance from the authorities of the two concessions in letters dated September 14. To this day, the black market for rice is becoming more intense, and the livelihood of citizens is at stake.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Meeting Still Had No Results</p>
<p>The committee decided to abide by the intentions of the concession authorities and resumed its business at 3 p.m. yesterday at the conference hall on the third floor of No. 15 Avenue Edward VII, convening a full committee meeting. The authorities of the two concessions were also invited to send representatives to attend. Chairman Zhu Zixiang first reported the purpose of the meeting, and then the committee members expressed their opinions one after another, and the situation was very tense. Most agreed that expanding the committee's work and inviting representatives from various public groups to join the committee as official members was a matter of course, with the aim of achieving significant results. Then, discussions began, and the results of the deliberation were as follows: Upon receiving notification from the Public Works Department, the proposed evaluation of foreign rice prices was resolved as "a representative will be sent to visit the authorities to present the difficulties of the evaluation and the current situation of foreign rice pricing in detail, and it is planned to convene a joint meeting after receiving a formal reply from the authorities. At the same time, rice and clothing organizations will be notified to quickly order foreign rice in order to increase reserves." The meeting adjourned at about 5 p.m.</p>
<p>Admonished the Rice Industry to Promote Orders</p>
<p>Mr. Ho Te-Kuei, Deputy Director-General of the Public Works Department of the International Settlement, in view of the frequent rise in rice prices, which is related to the entire social security situation, invited rice industry leaders such as Zhu Zixiang to the bureau at about 11 a.m. yesterday to receive instructions. Mr. Zhu arrived at the bureau on time at about 11 a.m. yesterday to receive instructions. Deputy Director-General Ho immediately discussed two points, (1) taking advantage of the current low production price of foreign rice, strongly encourage the industry to order a large amount of foreign rice to be transported to Shanghai for regulation to prepare for unexpected needs, and (2) permission is granted to re-evaluate the highest selling price of foreign rice in the market based on the production price of foreign rice. All representatives agreed to comply.</p>
<p>The Regulation Association Subscribed for Foreign Rice on Behalf</p>
<p>The Shanghai People's Food Regulation Association, located at Room 331, 3rd Floor, YMCA, 8 Sikan Road, has been established for nine months. Under the guidance of Chairman Yu Qiaqing and the joint efforts of staff at all levels, the association has subscribed for 21 batches of foreign rice, totaling more than 50,000 bags, on behalf of various sectors, with a total value of more than 2.5 million yuan. Recently, as rice prices have been rising, more than 20 units have joined the association, including groups in commerce and industry, with more than 3,500 bags, after being advised by the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and the Rice Evaluation Committee. It is heard that the Secretariat of the Association has sent a letter to the Purchasing Committee, advising them to pay attention to overseas market prices at all times, and to place orders when there are relatively favorable opportunities, as the 21st batch of orders. Groups and companies that register quickly can still join this batch. It is heard that the association's new method for subscribing for foreign rice stipulates that each household must subscribe for at least 50 bags and pay a deposit of 40 yuan per bag. The designated agency for collecting deposits is the Trust Department of the Kincheng Banking Corporation on Jiangxi Road.</p>
<p>Fair Price Rice Sales in the French Concession Temporarily Suspended Yesterday</p>
<p>Since the start of the sixth phase of foreign rice sales at fair prices organized by the Shanghai Fair Price Rice Sales Committee on the 19th, impoverished people who purchased it have been exceptionally enthusiastic every day. Although the roads were covered in several inches of water yesterday, the 36 locations in the International Settlement all continued to sell as usual, and impoverished men, women, old and young people in each district who carried baskets and bags and stood in the water to wait to purchase remained as usual. According to an announcement by the Fair Price Rice Sales Committee, the 24 locations in the French Concession temporarily suspended sales because the police officers of the police department were insufficient to protect the operation of trams.</p>
<h3>After the Establishment of the New Sino-American Loan, the United States Purchased a Huge Amount of Tungsten Ore; The Tungsten Ore Production Area Has Been Implemented Under Control; The Transportation Route Has Also Been Planned</h3>
<p>Tungsten is a raw material essential for national defense and industry. The world's mineral deposits are very few, and the production areas are only a few places. China's tungsten ore reserves are uniquely endowed and occupy an important position in the world's tungsten ore market. Most of it has been exported to the United States. After the establishment of the new Sino-American loan of 25 million yuan, the China Resources Commission purchased 30 million U.S. dollars worth of tungsten to meet the needs of U.S. national defense. It is heard that the Chinese government is trying to solve the transportation difficulties, implement control over the tungsten ore production area, and establish a tungsten industry management office to promote foreign trade in tungsten ore.</p>
<p>China's Tungsten Ore is Uniquely Endowed</p>
<p>China's tungsten ore was first discovered in Funing and Qian'an counties in Hebei Province. It was not until 1915 that tungsten ore was discovered in Jiangxi, Hunan, and Guangdong. Subsequently, mining began year by year, and the output of these three provinces was the largest. Followed by Guangxi, Fujian, Yunnan, Guizhou, Hebei, and other provinces. There are no accurate statistics on the total tungsten ore reserves in the country, but according to the Resources Committee's estimates in 1923, Jiangxi had 779,334 tons, Hunan had 21,400 tons, and Guangdong had 148,855 tons. However, after 1933, new tungsten mines were discovered in various provinces, and the reserves were quite considerable. Therefore, the exact amount of tungsten ore in China is still unknown.</p>
<p>The Only Big Customer is the United States</p>
<p>The export of tungsten ore was 73,629 metric tons in 1928, and decreased to 20,765 metric tons in 1932. By 1936, it had increased to 70,499 metric tons. After the war, it was 123,577 metric tons in 1938, valued at 50,492,087 yuan, 106,891 metric tons in 1939, valued at 44,674,912 yuan, and 27,737 metric tons from January to July 1940, valued at 12,731,765 yuan. Tungsten is exported to the United States and Hong Kong. However, the tungsten exported to Hong Kong is re-exported to the United States by ship. Therefore, China's only major customer is the United States.</p>
<p>Control and Management; Establishing Tungsten Processing Plants</p>
<p>In order to increase production and improve the tungsten industry, the Resources Commission has implemented control and management of the tungsten industry and established tungsten industry management offices in Hunan, Guangdong, and Jiangxi, the main production areas. It is stipulated that the tungsten ore produced in each province will be purchased by the tungsten industry management office of each province at a set price for unified export. Without approval, merchants are not allowed to transport tungsten ore out of the province. The purchase price of tungsten ore will be announced by each office. All central and local tungsten ore taxes will still be paid by merchants according to the original amount. At the same time, technical guidance and assistance will be provided to various tungsten mines. In view of the outdated tungsten processing procedures in the past, which caused great inconvenience to foreign merchants when purchasing, tungsten processing plants have been established to improve tungsten processing to meet the needs of foreign sales.</p>
<p>Transportation Route is Well Planned</p>
<p>Regarding the transportation of tungsten ore to the United States, it was previously concentrated in Guangzhou and transshipped to Hong Kong. Later, it was changed to concentrating in Haiphong for transshipment. Now that traffic on the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway has been interrupted and the Burma Road is temporarily closed, the Resources Commission is trying to solve the transportation difficulties and transport it to the United States via a new international route. However, because the route is long and too uneconomical, it has been decided to wait until the Burma Road is officially opened on October 17 before changing it to concentrating in a certain place for export via the Burma Road. At that time, ships departing from the United States will be specially used to transport Chinese tungsten ore to the United States. The transportation costs are kept strictly confidential.</p>
<h3>Portuguese Community Groups Celebrate Four Major Anniversaries</h3>
<p>The Portuguese community groups in this city are scheduled to hold a grand entertainment program celebration on the 5th of this month (Saturday) to celebrate four events: the 13th anniversary of the founding of the Portuguese Republic, the 800th anniversary of the founding of Portugal, the 300th anniversary of the restoration of Portuguese independence, and the anniversary of the establishment of the Portuguese community group in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Prohibit Luxury Goods and Practice Economy; As Prices are Expensive, Thrifting is Suitable</h3>
<p>In order to implement the ban on exports, the Ministry of Finance issued an order prohibiting the sale of luxury goods. The country was officially put into effect yesterday. The scope of the ban includes foreign cigarettes, cosmetics, toys, and various miscellaneous goods. The detailed list of goods has been reported in the news. The Shanghai Thrift and Relief Committee believes that at this extraordinary time, expensive economy consumption and economical expenditure is a matter of great importance. This ban by the authorities is one aspect of promoting thrift policies. It is hoped that all sectors of Shanghai will also take action from daily life to promote thrift in order to cut down on unnecessary consumption and use it for legitimate purposes, and to cultivate the virtue of frugality.</p>
<h3>Japan Promotes New Order; Public Complies Superficially, Violates Covertly; Hedonism and Extravagance Remain Unchanged; Imposing Austere Living Only Increases Lamentations; Impressions Discussed by a Certain Foreigner After Visiting Japan and Arriving in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Continental Times reports that a certain foreigner, recently arriving in Shanghai after visiting Japan, stated that the Japanese authorities have lately had a whimsical idea and are promoting a "new order" of their own design within Japan. The public is at a loss as to how to react to this. Although they are trying to adapt to the "new order," it seems quite difficult for them to reconcile it with the realities they encounter in their daily lives. The reason why there are no obvious signs of political instability in Japan on the surface is probably that any incidents of instability have very little chance of escaping the scrutiny of the inspectors and becoming known to the public. The above points are all based on the foreigner's observations comparing the daily life of the Japanese people now with their life two or three years ago.</p>
<p>Missing Meal Times Means No Food Available</p>
<p>According to reports, the daily life of the Japanese people now is completely different from what it was when the foreigner last visited Japan in 1937. The following points illustrate the current state of life for the Japanese people. All Japanese people entering dining rooms must strictly adhere to time limits. After 8:00 AM, no one can enter a dining room for a meal, and they must wait until noon to 2:00 PM to eat. Dinner time is from 6:00 PM to 8:00 PM. If one does not have time to eat before 8:00 PM, one must go to bed on an empty stomach.</p>
<p>Strict Restrictions on Movie Theaters and Theaters</p>
<p>The Japanese authorities are deeply concerned about the people's dissolute entertainment. The gatherings of audiences in movie theaters and theaters, and the throngs of tourists in brightly lit downtown areas, cause considerable anxiety among the leaders of the "Spiritual Mobilization League." This league has the approval of the government and is quite powerful. Now, movie theaters are only allowed to show one feature film, and it must be in line with the spirit of the times and national policy. Theater performances must also automatically adapt to the current situation.</p>
<p>Geishas Active, Embracing and Kissing</p>
<p>At night, geishas are still quite active, circulating among tourists. However, the geishas' brightly colored kimonos have now been changed to simpler clothing that is "more in line with the times." Although the business hours of bars and brothels have been greatly reduced, they are as prosperous as ever. As a result, traffic to these places is extremely congested. Although public displays of affection such as embracing and kissing between men and women have been expressly prohibited, they are still seen, but only when they avoid the eyes of the police and plainclothes detectives.</p>
<p>Interference from Spiritual Mobilization League Members</p>
<p>On the main streets and thoroughfares, one often sees members of the Spiritual Mobilization League wearing plain clothes, setting a good example for the public and "creating a beneficial atmosphere in the streets of major cities." When they see pedestrians wearing extravagant clothes, regardless of gender, they stop them on the street to admonish them. Women with permed hair and painted faces are also admonished along the way. Therefore, female attendants in bars with permed hair often stay indoors during the day to avoid being admonished.</p>
<p>Following Young Women Leads to Arrest</p>
<p>Every night by 9:00 PM, or even 7:00 PM or 8:00 PM, the streets become deserted with very few pedestrians. This is because the authorities do not want the public to loiter, and they "dispatch plainclothes spiritual mobilization" personnel to observe the attitudes and behavior of pedestrians along the way. Those who appear to have no purpose are questioned. As a result, young men who follow single women along the way are often arrested, severely reprimanded, or imprisoned overnight before being released as a warning to others.</p>
<p>Rickshaw Pullers Covet Tips, Still Provide Transport</p>
<p>The authorities are deeply dissatisfied with the fact that entertainment venues are crowded with tourists and that social customs are deteriorating. In order to weaken the entertainment industry as much as possible, they warned taxis not to carry passengers to any entertainment venues. However, these regulations are actually complied with superficially but violated covertly. If tourists offer slightly larger tips, taxi drivers are happy to provide transport. Therefore, entertainment venues are still filled with customers.</p>
<p>Price Regulations are Just Formalities</p>
<p>Judging from the new regulations promulgated by the authorities, commerce should have come to a standstill due to the restrictions. In reality, merchants are now engaged in clandestine transactions, and business is only slightly worse than usual. However, merchants are already complaining about the difficulty of doing business. The government has announced that the general price level in Japan is still low, but in reality, it is impossible to buy goods at the prices announced by the government. The Japanese authorities have recently implemented a price control movement, and goods whose prices have been greatly reduced have almost disappeared from the market. Sellers would rather say that they are out of stock than sell at the officially set price. The public understands the hidden truth and can only buy a small amount of goods from familiar merchants by paying a price higher than the set limit.</p>

<h3>Goods and Passengers Held Up in Haiphong and Other Places; All Returned to Shanghai; Representatives Dispatched to Saigon</h3>
<p>The goods and passengers of various merchants in this city, previously held up in Saigon, Tourane, Haiphong, and other places due to the joint transportation of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou, are now being returned to Shanghai via Hong Kong due to the increasingly tense situation in Vietnam and the interruption of railway transport. After consultation among the representatives of various merchants, it was decided to return all goods held up in the aforementioned ports to Shanghai via Hong Kong. Representative Cao Anxuan was dispatched to Saigon immediately to coordinate with Shen Shida, the representative previously stationed in Saigon, and Chen Shaochu, the representative of the passenger association stationed in Kunming, to handle the return of the accumulated goods. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce has prepared letters to the Saigon Chinese General Chamber of Commerce and the Consulate General in Saigon to provide assistance.</p>
<h3>British Women Active During Wartime; Professor Cullies Gives a Lecture in Shanghai; All Organizations Can Send Invitations</h3>
<p>As the war in Britain intensifies, with German planes bombing the British Isles day and night in the thousands, the British people are mobilizing the entire nation at this critical moment, regardless of gender, to intensify their work. The activities of women are something that the women's community in Shanghai would be happy to hear about. Professor Winifred Cullies left England five weeks ago and recently arrived in Shanghai. She lectured at the British Women's Association on "Wartime Work of British Women," detailing the manufacture of military supplies, the organization of women's forces, the situation of rescue and evacuation of children. Professor Cullies will be leaving Shanghai soon. Women's organizations from all walks of life who wish to invite Professor Cullies to lecture can send letters to the British Association in China (17 The Bund).</p>
<h3>Relatives Sue Each Other Over Stored Machinery; Both Parties Found Not Guilty</h3>
<p>Zhou Yushu from Shangyu recently hired lawyer Wu Huatai to file a lawsuit in the Criminal Division of the Special Court, accusing Cao Chiliang of embezzlement. His statement roughly states that in the 17th year of the Republic, he opened Huanqiu Flashlight Factory in Lanfa Lane, Zhaojia Road in the city. Initially, he was profitable, but due to market influences, his business declined and closed down in the 24th year of the Republic, waiting for the market to improve and resume operations. However, what he always hesitated about was the disposal of the machinery. It happened that his elder brother Yulin's in-laws had built a huge residence at 26 Meier Nei Road, Julaida Road in the French Concession, which was very spacious. Therefore, he consulted with his sister-in-law Zhou Cao Shengmei, and his fifth brother, the defendant, agreed to store one six-foot lathe, two four-foot lathes, and two small thread rolling lathes, a total of more than twenty pieces, at the defendant's place.</p>
<p>In the beginning of storage, they felt at ease, but over the years, they complained. In January of this year, the defendant suddenly said that he was renting out the remaining rooms in the residence, and it was inconvenient to put the machinery in the house. He recently had several workshops building houses, so it would be better to move the machinery to the workshops. Since the defendant had Cao Liangji Construction Factory and was engaged in construction, he believed him. Recently, due to the influence of the European War, the value of the machinery has increased dozens of times compared to before the war. He asked the defendant where the machinery was stored, but he evaded and prevaricated, never giving a concrete answer. The defendant clearly had embezzled someone else's property in his possession, violating Article 335 of the Criminal Law, and requested that he be punished accordingly. The court, based on the statement, instructed Judge Huang Yan to open the Second Criminal Court. The defendant admitted that there was machinery stored and filed a counterclaim of false accusation. The court then ordered the defendant to post bail pending judgment. Yesterday morning, Cao Ruliang and Zhou Yushu were both found not guilty.</p>
<h3>Servant Colludes with Thieves at Lawyer Xu Zifeng's Home; Maid and Rickshaw Puller Detained Awaiting Judgment</h3>
<p>At the home of lawyer Xu Zifeng at 269 Wuding Road, from October of the 27th year of the Republic to August of this year, Xu Chunxiang, a 14-year-old maid from Danyang, took the opportunity to collude with a female servant and a rickshaw puller to steal legal tender, losing a total of 648 yuan, which was impossible to investigate. Recently, his wife, Wu, noticed that the maid Chunxiang's conduct was improper and decided to send her back to her hometown of Danyang to be disciplined by her parents. After Chunxiang found out, she asked the cook Wang Xu for a debt of 275 yuan, the rickshaw puller Zhang Yongguan from Yangzhou for 113 yuan, and the maid Wang Yu from Anhui for 50 yuan. They quarreled with each other. Xu's mother, Wu, heard about it and questioned the maid severely.</p>
<p>After the interrogation, she fully admitted that she had reported the situation to the Gordon Road Police Station, which sent detectives to bring Chunxiao, the female servant, the rickshaw puller, and others to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The police station lawyer Zhang Tianyin filed a public prosecution on charges of theft and requested an investigation. Then, Xu's mother said that Chunxiang had been a maid in my house for seven years and described the above situation in detail, questioning Chunxiang. Chunxiang confessed that she had been instigated by the female servant to steal money from the desk of the master (i.e., lawyer Xu) for three years, and that more than 500 yuan had been borrowed by the old servant Xu, the rickshaw puller Zhang Yongguan, and the maid Wang Yu, and asked for leniency. When questioned, Wang Xu and others gave evasive answers. Judge Jiang ordered them to be returned to custody to await sentencing.</p>
<h3>One Day in the Autumn Wind and Autumn Rain</h3>
<p>— Ouyang Shaohua</p>
<p>One night of wind and rain caused the problem of transportation after the resumption of streetcars and buses to be obstructed again. The roads, alleys, and even the residences in low-lying areas were immersed in a vast expanse of water. Although people had the experience of the "autumn flooding" in the past years, with the passage of time, things are very different today. For example, when you called for a rickshaw from the back door to cross to the road, the rickshaw puller used to grin and thank you for the fare you paid, whether it was five cents or ten cents. But now, calling for a rickshaw at the alley entrance like a "nanny" requires negotiation with at least ten or more rickshaw pullers, or even quarrels – because the rickshaw pullers are demanding high prices based on the weather. Or the tone of the reply even exceeds the arrogance of her master. In front of a tobacco shop (let me tell you, I was also waiting for a rickshaw), I heard their quarrel. The rickshaw puller not only warned her that rice was about to sell for eighty yuan per dan, but also taught her that if she couldn't afford a rickshaw, she would have to hurry on the road with her bare legs. Then came a live performance, lifting his wet legs from the water and sweeping them towards the "nanny" to show what it's like to hurry, but the "nanny's" face and body were splashed with two larger water stains, so she scolded him – but the rickshaw puller raised his head to greet the customer who was calling from across the street.</p>
<p>In every place where people were waiting for the rain to stop, no, waiting for a vehicle, the topic of conversation in small groups was always: from the streetcar strike to "Old Man Heaven". And when they saw cars driving past like small motorboats, envy and resentment intertwined: those who envied felt that they had "no vehicle to go out"; those who resented thought that the waves behind the car treated the crowd as a levee and rushed towards them.</p>
<p>Suddenly, someone had a flash of inspiration and brought up the "private car passengers" issue that a certain newspaper had suggested during the strike. Of course, no one objected, it was completely approved. And "sincerity works", a car with a black license plate did slowly drive to the side of the crowd and stopped. The car owner, who drove himself, immediately jumped out of the car and waved to the crowd. At this time, you might doubt whether this old car could fit so many people. Hmph! No need for you to worry unnecessarily! The car owner issued a request:</p>
<p>"Come on! Two dimes per person to push my car to the road ahead."</p>
<p>It turned out that the old car was flooded!</p>
<p>Here, I will boldly draw a conclusion that our "favored ones" are barefoot people!</p>
<p>Rickshaw pullers naturally take the top spot. Even those who "hunt for wild ducks" in the water should not be underestimated. Pushing old cars is still extra money. Their "legitimate business" is to "broker" from the alley to the rickshaw for a fixed price of two dimes, and from Sincere Company to Wing On Company for a fixed price of one dime. Whether you are a "Western-dressed youth" or a "modern lady," you must pay in cash, no discount. The third class is to walk barefoot yourself. Not only do you not receive the rickshaw puller's lesson, but you are also insured by the flood on the road, so you can rush around without the danger of entering the "tiger's mouth."</p>
<p>Because the obstruction of "travel" affects everything in the city.</p>
<p>Let's start with the heart of the city, Nanjing Road. The banners of "Autumn Sales" only have tattered strips of cloth left. The broken loudspeakers are playing hoarse songs. There are red water stains flowing down the bamboo poles of a painted cloth archway, as if earthworms are crawling on it, scaring away customers. Although several department stores are still "bustling," but this "bustling" is only "seeming" - they are here to avoid the rain, taking away the enjoyment of the eyes and nose, but not buying a single chocolate candy.</p>
<p>An employee of a silk and satin shop was using a mop to wipe the water stains on the shop floor, but the "customers" crowding in from behind brought in new "gifts". Among these many "looking customers," only an old lady bought a piece of leftover material worth eight and a half dimes. It is said that she has been in for an hour and a half.</p>
<p>Let me "omit" the rest of the quiet streets, shall I?</p>
<p>The neon light advertisements of restaurants, amusement parks, movie theaters, dance halls... are still squeezing in the wind and rain to attract attention, but forgive me for not having the courage to make a fleeting pilgrimage. Unless it's a hotel, if there are many people, you can sit down and play mahjong. If you are a "bachelor," the observant waiter will come to your door and offer a collective photo frame. The rain is outside the window, and the air inside the room is humid and warm. The hotels that have "No Vacancy" signs are now the only ones that are supreme.</p>
<p>After three hours of strolling in the afternoon, my clothes were forcing me to go home. Coming out of the bathroom, lying on the lounge chair, turning on the radio, I realized the value of rest after labor.</p>
<p>While reporting that you should take ×× Company's ×× pills to resist the cold, the reporter suddenly made a startling cough, a sudden news item: The schools of the Municipal Council will be temporarily closed from tomorrow. I initially thought it was reporting the news on the evening paper, but the evening paper only had "Tomorrow's Tea Seat Big Giveaway"; I called the radio station to inquire, and it turned out that it was a report that the Municipal Council had notified each radio station to report. Since wireless radio became popular in Shanghai six years ago, the "public service report" is still a first, and it is also a valuable historical material on the history of the rise and fall of Shanghai's radio.</p>
<p>The heavy rain did not show any signs of stopping in the evening, and perhaps it will continue for a few days. The problem of "travel" is still more serious than the strike, and the damage to all businesses is indeed an intangible loss. As the saying goes, "If heaven wants to rain, and a woman wants to marry," it is indeed beyond human power; but dredging the accumulated water on the ground is within human capacity. I remember that during the big flood last year, the British and French concessions jointly planned to dredge the Huangpu River and the tributaries of the Nanshi Rihui Port, so that Shanghai would not be made into a Venice scenic area, but the result was that it could not be implemented. In the past year, the bottom of the Huangpu River has probably increased by another inch or several fractions of an inch. "Accumulating sand into a tower" is a bank's advertisement, here it should be "disintegrated into pieces."</p>
<p>Dredging work is urgent!</p>
<p>After the rain stops, it will be sunny. Shanghainese, who grew up in a "cradle," should not just blame God. The entire concession and the citizens of the city should take responsibility for defending the "isolated island." Please poke your head out of the "cradle"!</p>
<h3>Old Clerk Embezzles Public Funds; Commits Suicide After Exposure; Withdraws Two Thousand, Boards Ship to Return Home; Immediately Apprehended, Resorts to Suicide</h3>
<p>Lu Xugen, the old clerk of Yu Kang Yarn Shop at 59 Hongren Lane, Tianjin Road, from Tongzhou, 25 years old, was ordered to withdraw 2,000 yuan of national currency from a nearby money house. Lu suddenly had a bad idea and planned to flee back to his hometown. He purchased goods worth 500-600 yuan and first took a car to the Shenfeng steamboat bound for Nantong on the Bund. He then landed and went to his younger brother Ruigen's place on Pingliang Road to say goodbye. Fortunately, the yarn shop noticed that Lu had not returned for too long, so they used the telephone to inquire with the money house and learned that the money had been withdrawn long ago. Knowing that something was wrong, they urgently sent someone to Ruigen's residence on Pingliang Road. By chance, Xugen was also there and was forced to return to the shop. He was reprimanded. Unexpectedly, at midnight, Lu was too ashamed to face anyone and resorted to suicide. He stabbed his throat with scissors, about half an inch deep. The blood flowed non-stop. He was discovered and an ambulance was urgently called to send him to the Tongren Hospital for treatment. It is said that his injuries were serious and his life was in danger.</p>
<h3>Loss of Meal Ticket Leads to Death; Zhang Jinsheng Dies of Bowel Rupture; Ren Daidong's Trial Concludes, Awaiting Judgment</h3>
<p>Ren Daidong, a Jiangbei native who was the head of the oiling team in the fine yarn room of the Xin Yu Yarn Factory at 8 Laobaisheng Road, had a dispute with Zhang Jinsheng (39 years old), the head of the oiling team from the same hometown in the Qinghua room, over the loss of a meal ticket worth one yuan on the afternoon of September 25. They argued and fought each other. As a result, Zhang was seriously injured and sent to Baojiang Hospital, where he died at dawn the next morning. After the incident, he was arrested by the Putuo Road Police Station and sent to the First Special District Court for questioning and detention. Yesterday morning, Judge Jiang Shuzi visited the court for review. The police station lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated that during the adjournment, the deceased had been autopsied by a forensic doctor, and Zhang's abdominal injuries were very serious, leading to bowel rupture and death. Although his spleen had a slightly unhealthy mass before his death, the defendant punched him in the waist, causing the disaster. Please handle it accordingly. Then, Chen Xiangyun, the factory supervisor, testified that he witnessed the two sides arguing because a worker under them lost a meal ticket, and they suspected that it was picked up by a worker from the defendant's Qinghua room. The deceased took the initiative to throw a porcelain rice bowl, hitting the defendant in the face, causing bleeding at his left eyebrow. The defendant then punched him in the waist. The defendant claimed that he had no prior grudge against the deceased and that it was an accident, and asked for leniency. Judge Jiang ordered him to be returned to custody to await sentencing.</p>

<h3>National Academic Research by Higher Education Faculty: Pre-War Research on Various Topics Yields Results; Post-War Research Aligned with Practical Issues of Reconstruction</h3>
<p>(Chongqing Airmail) Academic research is not only the responsibility of research institutes, but also of all specialized schools and above throughout the country. The Ministry of Education began investigating the research topics of faculty in specialized schools and above in the 22nd year [of the Republic, i.e., 1933], and considerable results were obtained before the war. (1) A total of 1,066 faculty members in specialized schools and above nationwide, including national, provincial, and private institutions, were conducting specialized research, of which 738 were independent researchers and 147 were collaborative researchers, totaling 885. These were generally faculty members, while 181 were research assistants, mostly teaching assistants. Considering that the total number of faculty in specialized schools and above nationwide at that time was 7,560, those engaged in specialized research accounted for slightly more than 14 percent. (2) The survey period included research work over two and a half years. With 1,066 individuals and 1,125 topics, only 59 individuals were researching two topics simultaneously. On average, each faculty member researched only about one specialized topic in two and a half years. (3) There were 328 collaborative researchers, averaging less than one collaborative researcher per research director. Collaborative researchers were mostly teaching assistants and assistants, followed by graduate students, with very few undergraduate students. (4) In terms of the nature of research topics, there were more practical science topics than liberal arts topics, with 745 practical science topics and 380 liberal arts topics, a ratio of roughly two to one. (5) By school type, national and provincial institutions had a total of 676 researchers and 664 topics, while private institutions had 384 researchers and 451 topics, indicating that the latter required fewer research personnel but had more research topics. Even considering practical science topics alone, national and provincial institutions researched 394 topics, while private institutions researched 344 topics. The difference was very limited. (6) In terms of the completion of specialized research, 597 topics were completed, slightly more than the 518 incomplete topics. Comparing the number of topics completed by national and provincial institutions with those completed by private institutions, the former completed 262 and the latter completed 335, indicating that private institutions also completed more specialized topics.</p>
<p>From the above, it can be seen that the faculty members of specialized schools and above in the country tend towards academic research. The survey may have some shortcomings, and the enthusiasm of faculty members in various schools for reporting may not be consistent. The size of the research topics may also not be entirely the same, but it is not difficult to get a glimpse of the academic research situation here.</p>
<p>The importance of academic research is well known. Furthermore, it can establish the foundation for the independence of domestic academics and improve the cultural level of the people. From the perspective of teaching, if a professor does not conduct research on the subject they teach and cannot keep up with the times, the knowledge they impart to students will inevitably be outdated and mechanical, and they will not be able to gain the respect of students. Conversely, if a professor can engage in research, their interest in and methods of academic inquiry can be unconsciously modeled by students, and their contribution will certainly exceed that of those who can only study academic subjects without the opportunity to train students. Therefore, whether faculty members of specialized schools and above are happy to study academic subjects has a great impact on the academic atmosphere. According to the above-mentioned situation of specialized research by faculty members of specialized schools and above, it seems that it is still necessary to promote and improve. The most important aspects are: (1) How can research work be universal, so that every full-time faculty member has a research of their own specialised question? (2) How can the research period for each question be shortened so that the research results can be contributed to society as soon as possible? (3) How can research collaborators or assistants be mostly graduate students and undergraduates to enhance teaching effectiveness and cultivate students' independent research capabilities? The above three points are the key to promoting the research work of faculty members in specialized schools and above, and all schools should work together to achieve them.</p>
<p>Since the July 7th Incident [beginning of the Second Sino-Japanese War], although many specialized schools and above have moved and relocated, the research work of faculty members in various institutions has not been slightly slackened. The Ministry of Education has issued an order to various institutions to continue to work hard on various specialized research topics, and instructed that, in addition to researching pure academics, various practical issues should be studied at any time to meet the needs of the War of Resistance against Japan and national construction. After the order was issued, the institutions that reported their recent research work to the Ministry included National Sichuan University, Wuhan University, Provincial Gansu College, Private Jinling University, Xiangya Medical College, and 17 other schools, with a total of more than 110 specialized topics. In terms of nature, there were 47 topics in literature and history, 61 topics in agricultural science, 35 topics in science, 10 topics in law, 16 topics in education, 14 topics in engineering, and 7 topics in medicine. Specialized topics related to the War of Resistance against Japan, military affairs, and the construction of the Southwest and Northwest included: (1) research on alcohol as a gasoline substitute; (2) research on oil absorption of toxic gases; (3) the issue of land reclamation in Leibo, Mabiang, and Emei, Sichuan; (4) research on the military geography of western China; (5) research on ethnic groups in the Northwest; (6) the culture and beliefs of ethnic groups in the Northwest; (7) land use and population distribution in Sichuan; (8) research on the Qiang-Han issue; (9) the impact of the Sino-Japanese War on China's economy; (10) compilation of historical materials on the War of Resistance. The research questions of faculty members in other institutions are still being reported and compiled. The promotion of academic research work cannot be limited to the current faculty members of specialized schools and above. The Central Committee passed the "Measures for Protecting Academic Talents" and the "Measures for Protecting Technical Personnel" at its 189th Standing Committee meeting, which stipulated the establishment of "Academic Research Awards" and "Determined subsidies for specialized personnel to facilitate practical research." The Second National Education Conference in the 18th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1929] resolved to formulate detailed measures for implementation based on these principles, but due to personnel delays and financial difficulties, it was difficult to put them into practice. The Third National Education Conference also discussed this issue. In the future, we should adhere to this original intention and seek to realize it in order to promote research work and seek the independent foundation of Chinese academics.</p>
<h3>Jiang Menglin Reports: Southwest Associated University Prepares to Move to Sichuan; Tsinghua Principal Mei Has the Spirit of a Camel</h3>
<p>(Chongqing Airmail) The Tsinghua University Chongqing Alumni Association celebrated the 25th anniversary of Principal Mei Yiqi's service to Tsinghua University at the Jialing Hotel at 4:00 PM on September 22nd. Because Mei was in Kunming, he was unable to attend. It so happened that Peking University Principal Jiang Menglin came to Chongqing on official business, so he attended as an alumnus and reported at the meeting that he was summoned to Chongqing to discuss the relocation of the school. The Southwest Associated University, with its people and materials, is 40,000 tons in size, and has 5,000 people, young and old. The move from Yunnan to Sichuan requires more than 300,000 gallons of gasoline, so this matter is very complicated. Life in Kunming is difficult, and rice prices are very high. Professors and students are working diligently in their respective positions in extreme frugality. Jiang praised Mei for his long service to the school and his loyalty to his work. The two have worked together at the Southwest Associated University for many years. Mei often handles official affairs, while Jiang often travels. Jiang said that northerners have the spirit of a camel, while southerners have the agility of a monkey. Therefore, he attributed the spirit of a camel to Mei, and considered himself to be as agile as a monkey.</p>

<h3>Young Women's Christian Association Selects Table Tennis Doubles Representatives; Zhang Yongru and Others Listed; Attending Charity Table Tennis Performance</h3>
<p>The Young Women's Christian Association table tennis team, which is the leader in women's singles in Shanghai, was invited by Yuan Ludeng, chairman of the Nanchuan Children's Hospital, to send representatives to attend the charity table tennis match and compete in doubles against the Shanghai mixed women's team. The Young Women's Christian Association felt it was their duty and selected doubles representatives in the auditorium of the association at 4:00 PM yesterday afternoon. No team member was absent, and the atmosphere was warm and exciting. Under the close scrutiny of instructor Chen Linsheng and sports director He Xuchu, all 16 members were divided into eight groups and competed in rotation. Then, they exchanged opponents to compete. Finally, eight players with the most skilled hitting were selected and divided into four groups to decide the final performance. It was decided that the first group would be Zhang Yongru, who is good at drawing the ball, paired with Hu Jiahe, who is all-around. The second group would be Yang Chengdi, who is good at cutting the ball, paired with Zhu Shangxin, who is good at drawing the ball. The third group would be Wang Chongmei, who is good at drawing and blocking, paired with Fang Xiuwen, who is good at hard drawing. The fourth group would be Zhang Dexin, who is good at drawing and blocking, paired with Wang Mingxia, who is good at drawing the ball. The above-mentioned female players were originally the best singles talents in Shanghai, but they lacked practice because there were no doubles matches on weekdays. Now that they are neatly paired, one attacking and one defending, they can be called a perfect match. Under the guidance of veteran Chen Linsheng, they will actively intensify training and will surely become a well-trained army. Its strength is definitely not below that of the mixed women's team. It is heard that Chairman Yuan of the Nanchuan Children's Hospital will host a banquet this weekend to entertain all committee members and the press to achieve excellent results and expand publicity, so that they can plan together.</p>

<h3>Hong Kong Football Season Opens: South China Loses to Scottish Regiment; Li Huitang Unable to Turn the Tide</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong Correspondence) The Hong Kong football season has begun. All Chinese teams are stockpiling food and recruiting troops. The emerging Star Island team has recruited famous players from South China and other teams. It has first-class players such as Zhang Rongcai, Li Tiansheng, Xu Yahui, Guo Yingqi, Feng Jingxiang, Ye Beihua, and Li Zhaorong. Its strength is knowable. However, because South China's sales department left one after another, the lineup was inevitably affected. On September 14th, the Star Island team vs. the Hong Kong Club in Happy Valley, Yu Garden. The Hong Kong Club's lineup was mediocre. The Star Island tigers were majestic on all sides. Li Zhaorong scored first, and Ye Beihua followed. The result in the first half was five to one. Star Island was leading. The battle resumed, and it was still Star Island's world. Deng Guangsen and Ye Beihua scored successively. Finally, the Hong Kong Club forced a goal in and ended the game. In conclusion, Star Island won a big victory with a score of nine to two. In another game, the South China Club vs. the Scottish Regiment on Caroline Hill. Because South China's strong players were scattered, the football king Li Huitang put on his armor, and Cao Guicheng also made a comeback. At the beginning of the game, the football king passed the ball and attacked, dribbled to the hinterland, and shot an arrow fiercely, but was blocked by the opponent's Boley Sand. Ho Xi took the opportunity to counterattack. Left winger Elai responded properly and hooked in a goal, scoring first. After South China lost a city, it desperately counterattacked. Li Shuoyou and Zhu Yongqiang were like a broken bamboo. The football king responded in the enemy's goal and shot with all his strength. The ball hit the post and bounced into the net. The first half ended in a 1-1 draw. After changing sides, the Scottish Regiment used a clever plan. When the South China Club launched an all-out attack, Elai got the ball and broke through and passed the ball to the center line. Jushi flew to catch up and scored another goal, winning another goal. After that, although South China frequently attacked, it ultimately failed to score. As a result, the Scottish Regiment defeated South China with a score of two to one. The lineup of Star Island and South China on that day is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Star Island Team</p>
<p>Zhang Rongcai</p>
<p>Li Tiansheng Hou Rongsheng</p>
<p>Liu Weipei Xu Yahui Song Lingsheng Guo Yingqi</p>
<p>Liu Songsheng Feng Jingxiang Li Zhaorong Ye Beihua Deng Guangsen</p>

<h3>High-Quality Rice Rises to 95 Yuan; A Few Manipulate the Glutinous Rice Market; Everyone is Forced to Eat Expensive Rice</h3>
<p>Ever since the only bicycle source of newly-milled high-quality domestic rice was cut off due to rain, rice prices have soared day by day, repeatedly creating unprecedentedly high prices. Yesterday, the rising trend continued unabated. Market goods have become rare treasures. Therefore, you can choose not to inquire, but once you ask the price, the prices are arbitrarily shouted. Ordinary retailers, in order to cope with their business, urgently need to replenish their stocks and have to be at their mercy, leading to a surge in prices one after another. High-quality domestic rice has risen by as much as three or four yuan. It is heard that regular high-quality rice is 95 yuan, ordinary is 93.5 yuan, Su Kun high-quality rice is around 90 yuan, Nanhang early rice is 92 or 3 yuan, and newly-milled Zhuanqiao rice also costs 85 yuan. Taicang Jiading Yangjian is 74 or 5 yuan, and Qingjiao Dujian is 76 or 7 yuan. Although glutinous rice is a supplementary product, it is difficult to keep pace with the high-quality rice, but it also rises along with it. Jinli special is 73 yuan, Changdan goods are 71 or 2 yuan, and Hong Kong yuan is the same. At this point, general foreign rice speculators have seized this good opportunity and, regardless of the steady flow of foreign rice sources, use the soaring price of domestic rice as an excuse to extend their manipulative magic hands, and the market has been quite shaken. In the early market, due to the contraction of foreign exchange, the previous telegrams were not actually transferred, and the market price was raised by nearly one yuan in the rumors. However, after the price increase, the selling pressure turned strong, and both actual sales and hoarders were dumbfounded. Moreover, there were many new telegrams, and it was rumored that there was a possible agreement for a batch of No. 2 Saigon rice at 77.5 yuan. Therefore, the subsequent market immediately fell by about two yuan. As a result, it fell by only one yuan. More than 300 tons of returned original packages were opened. No. 2 Saigon ranged from 79 yuan to 80 yuan, and Siam No. 2 was 78.5 yuan. Spot rice transactions totaled 6,000 bags, including No. 1 Saigon at 74.35 yuan, No. 2 Chen at 70 yuan, new at 68.5 yuan, 68 yuan, Siam No. 2 at 67 yuan, small twist at 67 yuan, and 66.7 yuan, and rice bean at 58 yuan.</p>
<h3>Oil Market Prices Rise Frequently; Mostly Manipulated by Speculation</h3>
<p>Yesterday's edible oil trading did not lose its lustre due to the heavy rain. Under the circumstances that both the inland and local areas felt a lack of soybean oil supply, raw oil was also regarded as expensive. Therefore, people's hearts in the market were full of excitement, and were teased by speculation, causing the market price to frequently move towards a peak. The statistics are as follows: 100 pieces of Jiaozhou soybean oil were priced at 78.5 yuan to 79.5 yuan, 50 barrels of Qingdao soybean oil were priced at 108 yuan to 110 yuan, 250 dan of Dalian bulk oil were priced at 88 yuan to 88.5 yuan, 200 dan of Dayou factory oil were priced at 89 yuan to 89.25 yuan. For peanut oil transactions, 200 pieces of Jiaozhou spot oil were priced at 71.5 yuan to 72.25 yuan, 200 pieces for delivery in the first ten days of October were priced at 71.5 yuan to 72.5 yuan, 700 pieces for delivery in the last ten days of October were priced at 72.75 yuan to 73.75 yuan, 100 barrels of Qingdao oil were priced at 97.75 yuan to 98.5 yuan, 100 barrels for delivery in the first ten days of October were priced at 98 yuan, 250 barrels for delivery in the last ten days of October were priced at 98.7 yuan to 100 yuan, and 350 cans of canned oil were priced at 96 yuan.</p>
<p>350 bags of raw peanuts and 500 cans of raw oil were shipped from Yantai yesterday, and 1,320 cans were shipped from Qingdao. On the 2nd, 850 bags of raw peanuts will be shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Financial Foreign Exchange Tightens Again Yesterday; Speculators Absorb Tirelessly</h3>
<p>The foreign exchange market yesterday saw no changes in HSBC's listed prices. The black market for British and American exchange tightened, because the previously circulating rumors dissipated. Operators switched from blocking to scraping. Initially, Huashang Bank结进 was the most profitable, but due to the low price, speculators followed suit and scraped, and in the imbalance of supply and demand, it softened. The aftermarket sucked strongly every day, affecting a lot. And speculators continued to come in, without any sense of weariness. Until the evening close, British gold was seen at 3 pence 515625, and American exchange was at 5.5 yuan, which was 0.03125 tighter than the previous day's closing price, and American exchange contracted by 125. Futures and spot prices were similar.</p>
<p>Huashang Initially Came to Purchase and Settle</p>
<p>Early in the morning, the London Market announced the Great Article, and both near and far were settled. London's Raw Gold remained stagnant, the British Exchange rate against the United States did not move, against Shanghai it tightened 0.0625, the American Exchange rate against Britain grew to 96875, rose 24 cents against Shanghai, and the Central government’s Listed Prices for each exchange remained the same. The banks opened the current spot prices in the morning, British gold was at 3 pence 46875, and American Exchange was at 5.65625 yuan, compared to the previous day's closing price, British was steady and American softened by 0.03125. After opening, banks purchased, and the market surface softened slightly, calculated as entering Foreign Banks with the Current American Exchange at 5.625 yuan. Afterwards, speculators followed in, entering Foreign Banks to close the current American Exchange at 5.59375 for this month, with HSBC listing prices remaining unchanged and with the Silver Balance Tax listing remaining unchanged. At that time, The Huashang Bank's Current Leading First Order entering the Foreign Banks' Bank Meeting was 3 pence 53125, until noon, the Huashang Bank and Sassoon’s required amounts remained strong, at a time when Sellers were rare, the price tightened again, calculated as the Foreign Banks' stuffing with the Huashang Bank and Sassoon’s closing of the Current American Exchange at 5.5625 yuan, up to 53125, the noon closing price was 5.53125 yuan, and 3 pence 515625, each of the British and American was softer by 0.03125 and 125 compared to the morning opening.</p>
<p>American Exchange Spot at 5.5 yuan</p>
<p>The afternoon continued to tighten, because Japanese banks also came into the market to settle accounts, calculated as entering Current American Exchange at 5.53125, and speculators bought this month's American Exchange from an American Bank for as high as 5.5 yuan. This continued until the market close without much change. As a result, British Gold was at 3 pence 515625, and British Exchange was at 5.5 yuan, the values for this month and spot were the same, November's British Gold was at 3 and a half pence, and American Exchange was at 5.46875 yuan, each of the British Gold's Futures and Current were reduced by 0.03125, and American Exchange softened by 125 compared to the previous day's closing.</p>
<h3>Discount Rate Recovers by One Yuan; Call Loan Rate at Small Two Points</h3>
<p>Yesterday's exchange drafts and bills discount rate saw a slight increase. Both in the morning and afternoon, the discount rate was 18 yuan per thousand yuan, and the lending rate required 20 yuan, calculated as a recovery of one yuan. The interest rate for call loans at the Money Industry Association was reduced by two points, calculated as hanging at one dime.</p>
<h3>Gold Market Reverses Previous Day's Selling, Surges 125 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, spot gold soared, and the black market sharply rebounded, reversing the intense selling pressure of the previous day. This was due to the dissipation of rumors and rising confidence. The exchange rate weakened, and there was a continuous stream of buyers taking advantage of the opportunity. Furthermore, Hong Kong banks absorbed a significant amount, and gold firms and securities companies also participated, not wanting to be left behind. It is anticipated that the 6,000 yuan mark will be easily reached again. The highest price of the day was 5,930 yuan, and the closing price was 5,905 yuan, a sharp increase of 125 yuan compared to yesterday's closing. Total trading volume for the day was over 3,500 taels. Gold jewelry shops eventually increased prices by 20 yuan, while customs gold and other items remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly Good Sentiment</p>
<p>The good sentiment at the start of the morning was truly unexpected. Gold firms initially offered 5,900 yuan for 20 taels, opening the market. Later, gold firms sold at the high price, causing it to decline. Securities firms sold 30 taels to gold firms for 5,815 yuan, the lowest price of the day. However, as foreign exchange rates tightened, money exchanges and securities firms began to absorb the supply, driving the price higher again. Securities firms sold 20 taels to money exchanges for 5,880 yuan. Later, some money exchanges and individual investors sold slightly, causing the price to dip slightly. Ultimately, purchases from Hong Kong electric companies, banks, securities firms, and gold firms surged, pushing the price above 900 yuan. Gold firms bought 10 taels from securities firms for 5,910 yuan. Around noon, buying momentum slowed slightly, but the exchange rate remained weak, allowing the price to hold steady. Securities firms sold 20 taels to gold firms, briefly falling back to 5,870 yuan. Gold firms then bought 10 taels from securities firms for 5,895 yuan. In the end, banks sold 10 taels to gold firms for 5,885 yuan, pulling the closing price down slightly. Gold firms sold 10 taels to banks for 5,885 yuan. Before the close, Hong Kong banks showed strong appetite, buying aggressively and pushing the price up to 5,905 yuan for the late closing price, an increase of 120 yuan compared to the previous day. The price fluctuated by 115 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of spot gold from cash gold firms was more than 10 yuan higher than spot gold, and the buying price was reduced by 30 yuan. Spot gold for standard gold remained 50 yuan lower than the listed price, with little trading.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Revised to 610 Yuan</p>
<p>The selling price of gold jewelry at jewelry stores increased by 10 yuan per tael in the morning, and then another 10 yuan in the afternoon. Large firms were asking 610 yuan, while newer firms had similar prices. The buying price was reduced by around 30 yuan.</p>
<h3>US Dollar Rises Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market rebounded strongly in both spot and black market trading due to the unconfirmed rumors from the previous day. British and American gold pounds both rebounded by three yuan. The supply and demand for British gold notes were balanced, and market prices remained stable. The price of US gold notes rose sharply in the evening to 18 yuan due to the significant contraction of the US dollar black market exchange rate, an increase of 4.2 jiao compared to the previous day. There was no shortage of demand for Hong Kong notes, and the market price rose by 3 fen. Japanese gold notes continued to weaken by 5 li, with the evening price at 1.475 yuan. Korean notes saw slightly increased demand, and the market price rebounded by 1.5 fen to 1.175 yuan in the evening.</p>
<h3>Bank Clearing House Lowers National Currency Interest Rates</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Banking Association Clearing House has changed its interest rates as of yesterday (the 1st) as follows: (Government bond discount rate) national currency 0.25 yuan, interbank transfer 0.18 yuan; (Acceptance bill 9-10 day discount rate) national currency 0.25 yuan, interbank transfer 0.18 yuan; (Interbank transfer fee) 0.15 yuan; (Deposit interest except 0.05 yuan) interbank transfer discount interest) 0.18 yuan, all calculated per 1,000 yuan per day.</p>
<p>"Note": Compared to the rates on September 17, the interbank transfer rate has not changed, and the national currency interest rate has been reduced by 0.03 yuan.</p>
<h3>Peaceful Securities and Bond Market</h3>
<p>The securities black market was relatively calm yesterday. Initially, it was slightly weaker due to the bombing of Kunming, but then slightly stronger due to short covering. Ding and Wu types saw new high prices, while Jia type was slightly weaker. The overall sentiment among various groups has eased, and there is considerable hesitation to short sell aggressively. Prices are too high, and people are waiting for an opportunity. The trend may stabilize. Throughout the day, Xin Fu consistently bought, maintaining the market price. There was also strong demand for No. 38, while Jiu Feng tended to sell off throughout the day. Lian Yi Tian Sheng also sold off. Market prices initially fell and then rose, with Ding and Wu types reaching new highs. The future still depends on environmental changes. The overall result was a further increase of 0.2-0.45 yuan, with a turnover of around 1.2 million yuan. A brief summary is listed below.</p>
<p>In stock trading, 30 shares of Commercial Press were traded at a price of 75.5 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the public utilities stock market was flat rather than stable. Trading volume was low. Prices softened briefly in the morning but recovered somewhat in the afternoon. There was also more interest in various well-known rubber stocks.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton Transactions Show Uncertainty, A Certain Exchange Has Opened</h3>
<p>The yarn market initially fell and then rebounded, showing signs of fluctuating. In reality, both long and short positions show great hesitation. Market sentiment, both inside and outside the industry, is mostly bullish, but prices are high, and bulls are taking profits, while short sellers are also active, resulting in a fluctuating and indecisive situation. However, actual sales have decreased significantly, yet market sentiment remains bullish, although the situation is unpredictable. Today, 490 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Spot yarn opened in the morning, and the price of gold plummeted in the afternoon of the previous day, giving short sellers an opportunity to exert pressure. Floating longs rushed to close their positions, and the trading floor eased slightly. The initial price for 20-count Shuang Ma yarn was 1,090 yuan. However, as sellers crowded the market, it fell to 1,075 yuan. Once the low price was reached, most people believed that the decline had reached a reasonable level and that it wouldn't hurt to buy two bales of long positions. Therefore, everyone bought, and the price rose straight to over 1,100 yuan. The total volume traded in half a day was 4,105 bales. The price of 20-count Shuang Ma yarn fell by 10 yuan. The amount bought by each group is listed on the left:</p>
<p>Traders 3,630 Hong Kong 475 Total 4,105</p>
<p>The rumored exchange finally opened yesterday. 20-count Lan Feng yarn is the standard, and the unit is 50 bales. It is said that the initial price for November futures was 1,000 yuan, and the January forward price was 960 yuan. The second round of November futures fell to 978 yuan, closing flat.</p>
<h3>Foreign Cotton Spot Sales Are Particularly Strong</h3>
<p>The spot cotton situation is still mediocre, but market sentiment remains bullish due to the difficulty in sourcing supplies. However, international volatility makes the future difficult to predict. Therefore, cotton trading has not been very active.</p>
<p>Another report indicates that in the foreign cotton market, the New York cotton market fell in the morning due to poor spot demand and some long covering. As a result, the closing price was three or four points lower than the previous day. Indian cotton futures are expected to fall by more than one rupee.</p>
<p>Foreign cotton trading in Shanghai has continued to be very active recently, but it has all been spot trading. Due to the difficulty of purchasing goods for shipment and the low inventory in the market, traders are particularly eager to buy spot goods, especially long-staple cotton. According to the current situation, the cotton market is quite firm.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods and Cloth Sales Are Quiet</h3>
<p>The domestic cloth market was stable yesterday, as yarn prices remained firm. However, due to heavy rain all day, flooded streets, and inconvenient transportation, business on this street was significantly affected. The selling prices in various markets, including the factory prices, remained firm, with most still at the original prices. Fine twills, due to active dyeing and sales, continued to rise by about 2.5 jiao per piece. The street saw 200-300 piece transactions, with Cantonese and Hong Kong traders buying nearly 200 pieces of blue cloth twill, Zhejiang and Fujian traders buying over 100 pieces of colored cloth and colored twill, and Jinlu Yantai traders buying over 100 pieces of coarse cloth and flannelette.</p>

<p>Identifying Genuine and Counterfeit Banknotes (7) - Shen Yun</p>
<p>(3) Bank of Communications Banknotes</p>
<p>One Yuan, Year 3 of the Republic (1914), American Banknote Company, both sides of the design are blue-violet, the front features a train locomotive passing through a mountain gorge, with the number "One Yuan" on both sides. The back features a large sailing ship advancing through waves. Genuine banknotes have fine and clean wave patterns with white wave crests, while counterfeit banknotes have the opposite. The cloud shadows and patterns in the sky are also crude. There are Hubei-modified-to-Shanghai banknotes, with the same design and style, but the face color of the Hubei banknotes is earthy yellow.</p>
<p>One Yuan, Year 16 of the Republic (1927), American Banknote Company, both sides of the design are blue, the front features the same scenery as the Year 3 version, with the place name "Shanghai" on both sides of "One Yuan". The back features the Arabic numeral "1" in the middle. Counterfeit banknotes have poor printing and rough paper, the blue color is lighter, and the train mountain scenery is blurry and easily identifiable. There are also Zhili Province branch discarded banknotes modified to the bank's one-yuan banknotes, where only the Chinese bank name is changed to the English bank name, but the design and color are different.</p>
<p>One Yuan, Year 20 of the Republic (1931), De La Rue Printing Company, both sides of the design are red, the front features a train in motion, with the number "One Yuan" on the left and a circular watermark of a train engine in the grid on the right. The back features a pagoda and house scene, with the Arabic numeral "1" on the right. None have been found yet.</p>
<p>One Yuan, Year 24 of the Republic (1935), De La Rue Printing Company, both sides of the design are blue-violet, the front features a train traveling along the coast, with the number "One Yuan" on the left and a watermark of a train engine in the grid in the right corner. The back features the same design as the Year 20 one-yuan version. None have been found yet.</p>
<p>One Yuan, Year 24 of the Republic, Waterlow &amp; Sons, Ltd., design is light red, the front features the number "One Yuan" in the middle, with an oval containing a scene of a galloping horse crossing the sea in the left corner, and an oval containing the bank's name in the right corner, visible under light. The back features the Arabic numeral in the middle and the right. These banknotes are modified from China Industrial Bank one-yuan banknotes. The Industrial Bank's name is covered with a red stamp, and the black Bank of Communications name is printed on top, making it usable.</p>
<p>Industrial Bank Building Scene</p>
<p>(4) China Farmers Bank Banknotes</p>
<p>Face Value, Year of Issue, Printing Company, Color and Design, Counterfeit Banknotes, Identifying Features and Characteristics, Modified Banknotes, Notes</p>
<p>Ten Yuan, Year 18 of the Republic (1929), American Banknote Company, this is a common banknote of the Hubei Provincial Bank modified and reprinted as Farmers Bank. On the front, the Hubei Provincial Bank name is covered with a black pattern, and the red Farmers Bank name is printed below. There is a seven-story pagoda scene in the oval in the left corner, with hidden marks of "Zhong Nong" (Central Farmer) on both sides of the number "Ten Yuan". The back is dark blue-violet, and the black Farmers Bank English bank name is stamped on top of the Hubei Provincial Central Bank English bank name, with the English place name "Hankou" below. There is the Arabic numeral "Ten Yuan" in the middle, with the serial number on both sides. Counterfeit banknotes are lighter in color and have coarser patterns. Identifying features include the pagoda scene in the oval in the left corner: genuine banknotes have clear pagoda layers and faint, natural cloud shadows, with distinct tree branches and leaves on both sides. Counterfeit banknotes have unclear pagoda layers, mottled cloud shadows and patterns, and indistinct tree branches and leaves, appearing as a blurry mass. There are Guangdong Provincial Bank and Zhili Provincial Bank discarded banknotes used for modification. Those who modify these banknotes take advantage of the fact that this ten-yuan Farmers Banknote is already a modified banknote to further alter the discarded banknotes, making them difficult to detect. The modified style is the same as the Hubei Province modification. However, the color and design are completely different. Therefore, as long as you remember that there is only one type of Farmers Bank modified banknote: the "Hubei Province" type, and pay attention to its design and color, you can identify it.</p>
<p>Ten Yuan, Year 24 of the Republic (1935), De La Rue Printing Company, both front and back designs are dark blue-violet. The front has the number "Ten Yuan" with an image of ancient farmers sifting rice and stacking grass on both sides. The back has a temple scene in the middle and a blank space with a cow head watermark in the right corner, and a picture of a horse in a field on the left. Many counterfeit banknotes have been found, and the printing patterns are still good, but the color is darker than the genuine banknotes and slightly black. Identifying points include the rural scene on the right side: the characters and buildings in genuine banknotes have finer and lighter colors and patterns than the surrounding patterns, while the patterns in counterfeit banknotes are also clear but the color is dark and black, and the same color as the surrounding patterns. Also, the clouds in the left corner and the trees in the right corner of the genuine banknotes have fine, clean, and light patterns, which are more easily distinguishable than the rough and black patterns of counterfeit banknotes. The back color is dim, the printing is poor, and there is no cow head watermark visible under light in the blank space on the right.</p>
<p>Five Yuan, Year 18 of the Republic (1929), American Banknote Company, this is also a common banknote of the Hubei Provincial Bank modified and reprinted as Farmers Bank, the same as the ten-yuan version. There is also a modified banknote, the same as the ten-yuan version.</p>
<p>Five Yuan, Year 24 of the Republic (1935), De La Rue Printing Company, both front and back designs are green, the front features the number "Five Yuan" with a picture of the rural harvest scene on both sides. The back features an ancient temple scene in the middle, a blank space with a cow head watermark visible under light on the left, and a picture of a cow in a grassland on the right. There are several types of counterfeit banknotes with poor quality that are easily identifiable. In better-quality counterfeit banknotes, the patterns are still clear but the green color is dull and the paper is rough, lacking the smooth gloss of genuine banknotes. The leaves and patterns are not as refined as in genuine banknotes. In the cow picture on the back, genuine banknotes have a cow belly and back with more green and less white, with very fine lines, while counterfeit banknotes have more white between their backs, and the lines are also coarse. There is no cow head watermark on the left.</p>
<p>One Yuan, Year 22 of the Republic (1933), China Daye Company, this is a banknote of the Farmers Bank of the Four Provinces of Henan, Hubei, Anhui, and Jiangxi, and is commonly used in the same way as banknotes of the China Farmers Bank. The front features a brown design with the number "One Yuan" in the middle and a picture of farmers picking rice and threshing rice on both sides. The back is gray-blue with a picture of farmers plowing in the field. Below is Yuan in English letters. The printing is extremely poor, and the indistinctness of the patterns of the farmers is the most distinguishing feature.</p>
<p>One Yuan, Year 23 of the Republic (1934), China Daye Company, this is also a banknote of the Farmers Bank of the Four Provinces, and is commonly used in the same way as banknotes of the China Farmers Bank. The front features a red design with a picture of three farmers sowing seeds on the left, the number "One Yuan" in the middle, and a blank space with a watermark visible under light on the right. The back features a green design with a picture of a farmer plowing a field with an ox in the middle, and the Arabic numeral "One" on the left, with blank spaces on both sides. There is a watermark in the blank space on the left.</p>

<h3>We Hope to Increase the Number of Stabilized-Price Rice Distribution Centers</h3>
<p>— Xiu Bi</p>
<p>Every time I pass by the stabilized-price rice distribution center, I see such a long line and cannot help but feel an unspeakable sadness.</p>
<p>This line of rice buyers is often as long as twenty or more stores, even thirty or forty stores. Among them are elderly women and young children. They are often crowded, and whips are often brought down on their faces.</p>
<p>We often hear many tragic stories that happen in the crowded stabilized-price rice distribution lines. An old woman or a child being injured or crushed to death has become a common occurrence.</p>
<p>We feel this is a problem that urgently needs to be improved.</p>
<p>The method of improvement, first and foremost, is to request the authorities to increase the number of stabilized-price rice distribution centers. We believe that the reason for this tragic phenomenon is that there are too few distribution centers. In reality, each stabilized-price rice distribution center that is rotated into service is only a handful, a mere ten or so, which does not constitute a significant proportion of the total number of rice stores in the city. We often see countless people standing in line waiting to buy at one rice store, while many rice stores nearby are empty, and the clerks in the rice stores are idly staring at the miserable line. This is a very uneven phenomenon.</p>
<p>Increasing the number of stabilized-price rice distribution centers is not a difficult solution. If the authorities were to increase the number of current distribution centers by two or three times, then the poor would receive inexpressible grace, and the rice stores as a whole, due to the vast number of stores, would not feel even the slightest inconvenience, and the number of stores rotating into service would definitely not be too great.</p>
<p>We earnestly hope that the authorities can increase the number of stabilized-price rice distribution centers!</p>
<p>We earnestly pray that the authorities can increase the number of stabilized-price rice distribution centers!</p>

<h3>Shanghai Today</h3>
<p>— Fan Xing (pen name)</p>
<h3>Sabbath</h3>
<p>— Bo Wenyuan</p>
<p>Sabbath. The church bells chiming with hymns carried on the breeze.</p>
<p>The early showing of "Burning of the Red Lotus Temple" is starting at the movie theater, the child says to me as he turns the newspaper over—actually seeking my opinion. I am loading film into the camera case, preparing to spend the morning in the park. Of course, I will never forget that today is the children's day. After hearing the child's report, I ask him: "Go to the movies, or take pictures?" He quickly abandons the idea of "A Ray of White Light" and asks his mother to plan his clothing for the photography session.</p>
<p>The autumn sunshine is warm, the breeze is light, and the edges of the small pond in the park are covered with the footprints of children: some are lying on the ground, some are playing ball, and some are squatting down carefully to grab the duckweed at the edge of the pond with their small hands… The innocence and vitality of children fills this small corner of the world.</p>
<p>After taking a few pictures of them, I sit down on the grass to read the newspaper. Not even ten minutes pass before they come back after walking around the river. The younger child also reports a news item: "They're selling bread over there." This is actually seeking my opinion, just like "Burning of the Red Lotus Temple."</p>
<p>"Let them happily spend a Sunday morning." I take them towards the pond.</p>
<p>In the thatched pavilion, a waiter in a white uniform is grilling bread on an electric stove—called Hot Dog. The people surrounding the pavilion are like those in front of the ticket counter at the movie theater, but there are very few children; most are young masters and misses. I give the children money, and they squeeze into the crowd. I lean against a tree and wait, secretly thinking that at least some people in the city are still living in the sunlight. But as soon as this thought flashes through my mind—no matter how quick—it is immediately driven away by the conversation next to me.</p>
<p>Walking past me are five or six young men and women. They have already seized the "hot dog" and are eating as they walk, their happy expressions exceeding their age. Speaking is a young woman wearing a light green cheongsam with a leather bag on her shoulder (too much like a school bag for elementary school students), she says:</p>
<p>"If you don't dance all night, how can you eat such good snacks?"</p>
<p>I look up again and glance around outside the thatched pavilion; nine out of ten customers have stayed up all night to eat such good snacks. Isn't that so? When the children jump in front of me holding their bread, it's another report: "The bread is sold out!"</p>
<p>Suddenly, a strange thought surges up. I take a picture of the children's expressions as they eat the bread, even though they went to bed early last night, this "snack" is an unexpected reward that isn't worth commemorating.</p>
<p>"Hot dogs" are flying everywhere in the park, and the sun is gradually rising overhead.</p>
<p>"Let's go to sleep!" I am awakened by the delicate cry of a miss, and the morning has passed very quickly.</p>
<p>Sabbath, I watch them go home to sleep soundly and also take the children home.</p>
<p>Hawthorn Case</p>
<h3>The Queen of Dance's Destination</h3>
<p>— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter 8 Capturing Two People</p>
<p>When she walked into the office, she slightly bent her waist towards Hawthorn and me, nodded, and wore a somewhat unnatural smile on her face, replacing the previous insincere aura. I secretly thought that the lesson Hawthorn gave her in the morning unexpectedly had such a swift effect. Of course, Hawthorn and I also stood up to greet her. After everyone sat down, her address and wording also put on the cloak of politeness.</p>
<p>She said, "Mr. Hawthorn, Mr. Bao, this matter is really troubling you. You must have already gone to Lilan's house to investigate, right? Have you gotten any clues?"</p>
<p>Hawthorn replied: "There are already a few clues, and we've already captured two people. But I was just about to talk to you about it. You came just in time."</p>
<p>Listening to Hawthorn's tone, it was clear that he didn't want to reveal that we went to knock on her door early this morning. She certainly wouldn't know that the person knocking on the door was Hawthorn.</p>
<p>Jiang Anna asked, "Mr. Hawthorn, I originally had some things I wanted to tell you. Now that you have already made an on-site inspection and have a few clues, then you might as well tell them to combine them."</p>
<p>Hawthorn nodded and said, "I would like to hear your thoughts first. Miss Jiang, who do you think did this?"</p>
<p>Jiang Anna hesitated slightly. "I think that Little Yu is very suspicious."</p>
<p>"Little Yu? - Yu Gantang? What reason do you have?"</p>
<p>"He and Lilan recently had a falling out. At first, they were as hot as fire. Recently, Lilan met someone named Zhao, and that Little Yu was jealous and said many terrible things to Lilan. Lilan had told me everything. Now that Lilan has suddenly been beaten to death, I can't help but suspect him. Mr. Hawthorn, have you investigated anything about this person? Is it possible for him to have taken action?"</p>
<p>Hawthorn nodded and said, "Yes, his actions are indeed suspicious. He has already been detained at the police station."</p>
<p>Anna said with surprise and joy: "Ah, that's great. This person has no conscience. Lilan was initially infatuated with him and treated him very well. He can turn his face so quickly, it's simply outrageous. Mr. Hawthorn, has he confessed yet?"</p>
<p>Hawthorn shook his head and said, "Not yet. Do you know how long Lilan and Little Yu have been together?"</p>
<p>"They met this spring - probably three or four months at most?" (124)</p>
<h3>Three Tragic Scenes</h3>
<p>— Jiang Lü</p>
<p>At dusk, as I strolled home in the lingering glow of the setting sun, I used my eyes as a natural camera to capture three tragic scenes on the road.</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>A portly food delivery man, carrying leftovers from people's packed lunches, hurried forward through the crowd. Three "leftover scavengers" lurking in the corner of the wall, like hounds spotting a rabbit, swarmed up like a disturbed nest of bees. The food delivery man, as if by tacit agreement, immediately stopped, letting them scramble for the remaining half-bowl or less of cold xian rice and some soup in the food bucket, pouring it all into their tin cans. One, slower than the others, didn't even get a drop of soup and angrily cursed, "Damn it, so little cold rice!"</p>
<p>"Rice is expensive now. The packed lunch providers only allow two bowls per customer. Is there even any left for you to scavenge?" The vegetable carrier waited for them to leave, disgruntled, before picking up his vegetable basket to return.</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>In front of a rice shop, there was a raggedly dressed woman holding a child of about three years old, with another child of six or seven standing beside her. The woman rummaged in her pocket for a while, eventually producing a crumpled five-cent auxiliary currency note, which she handed to the clerk, saying, "Measure out one sheng of rice."</p>
<p>The clerk disdainfully examined the auxiliary currency note, counting it and saying, "Only fifty-five cents. You can't even buy one sheng of broken rice with that."</p>
<p>"Sir, please help me out and measure out one sheng!"</p>
<p>At the bottom of a foreign flour sack, some rice was stored, shriveled, but smiles already appeared on the children's faces.</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>A truck loaded with rice parked in front of a rice warehouse. A person with a stern face and angry eyes, holding a whip, sat high on the rice sacks. A group of rice sweepers, like rats, scurried around the truck.</p>
<p>A steel rod was secretly inserted into a rice sack, and with a forceful pull, the rice flowed into their cloth bags.</p>
<p>"Damn it!" The whip landed on the heads of the rice sweepers along with the curses.</p>
<p>But to fill their stomachs, they endured the pain of the whip, dodging and hiding as they used "blitzkrieg tactics" to steal rice from the sacks.</p>
<p>This is a struggle for survival on the hunger line…</p>
<h3>Children's Calamity</h3>
<p>— Wang Pei</p>
<p>Shanghai is like a dark ocean, filled with man-eating sharks. Adults are inevitably struggling in this dark sea, and even innocent children are inevitably tainted by the dark sea or swallowed by the sharks.</p>
<p>Several weeks ago, this journal righteously exposed organizations that use children as tools for theft. In a previous issue of this journal, someone discovered children being induced and directed to steal. The existence of these scoundrels makes it easy for generally ignorant children to fall into their traps, thus suffering extremely serious moral and spiritual losses, or even developing the bad habit of stealing. To prevent one's own children from being tainted by the dark waters, the responsibility lies with the parents and schools to provide thorough prevention and to constantly warn the children, at least to make the children understand what kind of person they will become if they are deceived!</p>
<p>Cases of missing children are frequently heard of, and two large-scale organizations that abduct children for export have also been uncovered. Uncovered as they are, it is inevitable that a third or fourth child-trafficking organization exists. This is a children's calamity, parents of children! Teachers! Do everything possible to prevent it, to avoid calamity befalling you. Regret after the fact is futile; prevention beforehand is much more effective!</p>

<h3>The New Look of Shanghai Storytelling Venues After the Autumn Chill</h3>
<p>— Yuxiu</p>
<p>The autumn wind brings coolness, and the sweltering heat has completely dissipated. At this time, Shanghai storytelling venues typically have some personnel adjustments, vying to recruit well-known performers, extend their runs, and attract audiences, leading to fierce competition. Now that the Mid-Autumn Festival has passed, the arrangements for each storytelling venue have been largely finalized and they have opened their shows one after another. Therefore, there is a new lineup, and old listeners can rest assured that they won't lack places to enjoy themselves.</p>
<p>Xia Hesheng's Comeback</p>
<p>Looking at the daytime venues, "Haoyou" clearly has the strongest lineup. It boasts the four major headliners Huang Yian, Xu Guixiang, Wu Junan, and the Chen-Wei duo (Chen Xuefang and Wei Hanying). They are evenly matched, each capable of attracting a segment of the audience, with the "Chen-Wei" duo being the most popular. Because audiences in Shanghai are really tired of listening to the "Shen-Xue" duet, it's refreshing to change the flavor a little. On the other hand, "Nanyuan" features Zhang Hongsheng and Xia Hesheng. Zhang Hongsheng's "Airplane Martyr" seems to have a special connection with Shanghai audiences, so he repeats the performance again and again, never feeling tiresome. And "Descriptive King" Xia Hesheng, who has been out of the spotlight for a long time, is making a comeback now, so naturally, he will be a huge success.</p>
<p>Yang Renlin Welcomed Everywhere</p>
<p>The "Night Venue" is more appealing, with Wang Yunfeng and Yang Renlin as the backbone. There are originally not many storytellers who specialize in tales of weapons, and after the passing of Shi Xiufeng, scarcity increases value, so Wang Yunfeng has become the only great headliner who specializes in tales of weapons. Yang Renlin is the son of Yang Xiaoting, with extensive family knowledge and a good voice that never tires, so naturally, he is welcomed everywhere. In addition, the female ballad singers of Puyu Society, limited by talent, can only maintain the "Nanjing" corner and cannot have the opportunity to develop. And Yang Zhou storyteller Kang Youhua's Tales of the Three Kingdoms has actually appeared at "Longyuan," where there are many fellow Jiangbei countrymen, and it is said that the business is quite good.</p>
<p>An Obvious Surplus of Performers</p>
<p>The situation of an oversupply of storytellers in Shanghai's storytelling venues has become increasingly obvious recently. This can be seen from the fact that even first-rate storytelling masters like "Shen-Xue" and "Jiang-Zhu" do not have better venues to find a place for themselves. And even with "Descriptive King" Xia Hesheng's fame, he can only be confined to a corner of Nanyuan. At the same time, there is also a psychological contradiction between the venue owners and the audience: the venue owners hope for more performances and longer times to increase their income, while the audience feels that the stories are too short and unsatisfying after the number of performances is increased. Therefore, the business of each storytelling venue cannot be at its best, and that is the reason. This is a common phenomenon, and I think it is a problem worth noting.</p>
<h3>An Examination of the People Influenced by Confucius (6)</h3>
<p>— Tianye Drawing, Qingniao Writing</p>
<p>Shusun and Jisun were both senior ministers of Lu. The power of Lu was dispersed, controlled by the ministers, and the ministers were in turn controlled by their stewards. The two, in effect, were unable to serve their ruler above or control their stewards below. Together with Mengsun, they were the Three Families of Lu, all descendants of Duke Huan.</p>
<p>Confucius had a daughter, whose name is not known. At the age of twenty, she had a son named Li, courtesy name Boyu. Boyu gave birth to Zisi. Boyu was born during Confucius's time of roaming the world, establishing his teachings, and died early, unable to fully transmit Confucius's Way. By Confucius's later years, the doors of his school were deserted, his family scattered, and only Zisi remained by his side to rely on. Zisi, also known as Jiji, later studied under Zengzi, fully inheriting the teachings of the Confucius family. He became Mencius's teacher and was later honored as the Sage Transmitter.</p>

<h3>Thoughts on "Sea Country Hero"</h3>
<p>— Shen Qi</p>
<p>If it is said that "Sea Country Hero" is not stimulating enough, or that the high-mindedness is not as strong as "Regrets of the Late Ming," then that is a real misjudgment, at least the understanding of this play is weak. Therefore, this article specially points out the contained elements in the play.</p>
<p>In "Regrets of the Late Ming," the lives of Ge Nenniang and Sun Kexian reflect the bloody history of the era, so tragic, so somber. However, what cannot be said to be a weakness is that the atmosphere of bright and brilliant light is too low-pressure.</p>
<p>The waves in this "Sea Country Hero" first overcome this weakness, and the whole play is full of strong positivity, exposing Zheng Zhilong's betrayal, which ultimately will not win the complete favor of his master. The audience will certainly understand this. At the same time, it reveals the struggle of Zheng Chenggong over the years. He won and continued to fight, he lost and continued to fight, passing on his own experience to his children (Jing and Yu). The purpose of the long-term war is to win the final victory. Moreover, it is more active, explaining that this work is not limited to men, women, old, and young. All descendants of the Ming Dynasty should bravely shoulder it.</p>
<p>In terms of meaning, it is so full of fervent vigor that it almost makes one's heart boil after watching it. The play interspersed with Zheng's wife, Dong, and the loyal old general Zhang Mingzhen, are sufficient to show that in the great era, women and old people alike should also go to the forefront of the era.</p>
<p>Speaking of the performance, it mobilizes excellent actors from both the theater and film circles. Gu Lanjun's Dong is a profound and vivid expression, fully expressing the identity of the character in the play. Although it is her first time stepping onto the stage, I believe that she has a clear understanding of the times since playing Ge Nenniang on the screen. Otherwise, she would not have been able to perform so skillfully and appropriately. Liu Qiong's Zheng Chenggong is resolute and calm, fully grasping the character's personality. However, in the latter two acts, more than ten years have passed in terms of time, and he should seem older in makeup. In addition, Tu Guangqi's Guo Bichang, Chen Qi's Zheng Yu, and Yan's Majinzi consistently follow the style and lines in "Regrets of the Late Ming."</p>
<p>The background costumes of the whole play are relatively realistic and natural, and the sound effects are also very successful, but the gong sound before the opening is mechanically flawed.</p>
<h3>"Rin Tin Tin" Second</h3>
<p>— Bofen</p>
<p>Hollywood has a dog named Daisy, which is smart and clever and has been called "Rin Tin Tin" the Second.</p>
<p>Daisy won the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences' Best Animal Performance Award last year. Vivien Leigh and Robert Donat won the A-level "Oscars", and it won the B-level Oscar. This honor is still a first in American film history.</p>
<p>You may not believe it, but dog owner Rennie Renfro bought Daisy for five cents, and now, just the dog's insurance premiums have reached $25,000. Otherwise, Rennie Renfro has become a millionaire relying on it.</p>
<p>Daisy is a male dog, and it has no stand-in, which the dog owner only recently found in Southern California.</p>
<p>Its debut work was "If I Were King," and since then it has performed in five Blondie family films. When filming "Blondie on a Budget" recently, it received more than a thousand fan praise letters, and the entire crew jointly purchased a beautiful doghouse for it to enjoy. In addition, it even used its paw to "sign" autographs for fans 850 times. Daisy also makes friends, and its best friend is a cat named Sebastian on Columbia Stage 9.</p>
<p>After Daisy became famous, not only did it enjoy exquisite and rich material comforts, but the dog owner also hired famous trainer Roth Weisserwicks to be responsible for protection.</p>
<p>MGM recently borrowed it to play a famous role in "Susan and God."</p>
<h3>Talk About Opera</h3>
<p>— Su Shaoqing</p>
<p>The Theory of Observing a Name to Determine Fate (2)</p>
<p>Following the veteran performers Liu Hongsheng, Jia Honglin, Zhang Yuting, Wang Yutian, Zhu Xiaonong, and Wang Youchen, only Liu Hongsheng could compete with the old Tan. Liu's name is occupied by three level tones and two rising tones, which is equal to Tan Xinpei's three level tones and two rising tones. What is lacking is that the last "sheng" character in Liu's name is yin rather than yang, comparable to the hexagram , Xun, while the old Tan's name is , Li; the middle non-true yin, close to the three Qian. Comparing the two, Liu died of a wind disease in the Shanghai Great Stage, and his art was not widely spread. The old Tan enjoyed the age of Confucius, and his disciples numbered more than three thousand. Although it is said that it is due to high skill, the name is also greatly related. Below Honglin, all are two level tones, or two rising tones, or one rising tone and one falling tone, all are the kind of seventy disciples. Only Gui Junqing, the last word gets a "qing" character, yin level, and Luo Xiaobao, the first word gets a rising level, because he got one, but he could not get his wish. Looking again at Yu Shuyan, Yan Jupeng, Gao Qingkui, Ma Lianliang, Tan Fuying, Yang Baosen, Chen Shaolin, and Zhou Xiaotian, all three characters are two level tones, or two rising tones at both ends, Yu, Yan, and Chen are three people; or the first is rising and the last is falling? Tan and Yang are. Gao then has one falling and one rising, Zhou then has the first and last all falling, only Lianliang two names all rising, creating a unique style, and checking the past examples, then Jia Honglin takes on it, which is why there are similarities in art? Looking again at Chen Shaolin's three characters, the first and last are all rising level, which is the same case as the names of Yu and Yan, and the same case as Wang Yutian and Wang Youchen. This person will definitely be able to go a step further. The one who will continue Fuying has great hope. I listened to his voice round and clear, and observed his pure and quiet demeanor, outwardly yin and inwardly yang, the yang and rigidity are sufficient, and the thunder can sound, and in less than ten years, it can prove my words. There is a Wang Helin among the rising students of the Chinese Opera School, who gets three rising tones. I once heard him sing Hongyang Cave when he was thirteen or fourteen years old, and he was quite talented. Now I don't know how he is. I am afraid that the three rising tones are too strong, and there may be twists and turns in the middle. According to the above reasons, is it wonderful for my name to change one or two characters to Li Shengzao? (To be continued)</p>
