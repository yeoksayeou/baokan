<p>社評</p>
<h3 id="c2">越南之運命 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>昨日之前、法屬越南方面嘗一度發見其生氣；蓋在法日簽訂協定後、日本軍隊驟逼諒山；法國軍隊認為違反協定，即與抗戰；同時，若干法國官員宣稱，協定因日方破壞而註銷云。此一形態，使舉世之愛惜法國者為之興奮。吾人雖亦樂予策勉·但昨日社評既論之矣，謂「此非法越當局根本有所悔悟，倘日方稍能懸崖勒馬、歛抑就範，姑以條的所允為未來進一步行動之起點、則未必不能以比較和緩之面目易取其所需索之權益；而法越當局方慮寒盟之為患，日本亦不難進而有所作為。」又嘗指陳謂觀法越當局「近頃所發布之種種文告、惟有使人對其前途益增悲觀」。試證以今日報端消息，昨評不幸而言中；抗戰如曇花一現，法軍自諒山撒退：維希之半官消息且謂「日本西原將軍殆已完成其使命，越南北部邊境一帶，雖尚未完全恢復常態，但西原己竭盡所能，務使法日雙方於本月二十二日所成立之協定，能以實行。至越北邊境所發生之糾紛、實因中國廣西省境內之日軍企圖開入越南所致，現有理由可信此項糾紛已告解決」云。其屈服惟恐不及之神情可掬，而往日之以妥協原因諉過於英美之不予援助，愈見其徒為遁辭而已。</p>
<p>法國維希當局之本質與處境，可憐而不足責，是無待申論。至於越南前途，尚在未定之天、要非維希當局所能主宰；無論保全之，守衛之，非維希所克勝任；即割裂之、斷送之、亦非維希所得支配。夫豈意存菲薄？實以戰事爆發後之國際、允如成為問題之國家，一切有待決定於最後角逐之後；法國自政權移於維希，即已放棄其為最後角逐中之一員。維希政府對於國內外態度，倘若無改於今之道，則其運命視德義勝敗者一，視德義於最後角逐而竟勝利後之愛僧喜怒者又一。維希之根本猶若是其未安，遑諭所經手簽字之協定、更遑論協定所難控制之越南。</p>
<p>云何越南非協定所得控制？其一·協定之簽訂，雖經談判方式，然籠罩談判之四周者威脅也：是以協定之成立，實施，破壞，修改，增訂，廢棄，舉非協定所得而有拘束之實效；但觀協定簽字矣·違反協定者抗戰以爭之矣，而維希承認糾紛已告解決於其放棄諒山之後；即此一例，可知協定估值等於零：簡言之，協定是協定，越南自是越南，威脅行動始終是威脅行動，不相涉也。其二，越南內情因屢經更張而甚複雜，蓋自歐戰爆發之頃，以迄今茲，總督既三易其人。且逈殊其體系，現任總督矢忠維希，然以海軍將領而兼領陸軍，陸軍受所統轄而別有久於其任之長官，既於根性不免扞格、事權不免割裂。况於自由與屈服之二途，方在明爭暗鬭之際耶？日來頗傳陸軍方面以及人民方面多方活躍，四出張羅，醞釀若斯，成敗未下，待至水到渠成之日，畫龍點睛之時，一紙協定，數道政令，詎足以限之。其三，東亞大陸之事，最後必取決於中國之意態；西太平洋之事，最後必取決於美日之鬭爭：越南為東亞大陸之一角而面臨西太平洋，日本今次爭制機先，且氣燄咄咄日法日妥協非第三國所得十預；於是問題之關鍵、乃在美國是吾為所喝退，自此嘿爾而息？若日不然，日本所得於維希體系之一紙協定、究竟何足以當金圓與鐵艦。其四，即使在最近之將來，各方對日越未作有效之積極措施而日本竟得恣謀所大欲、顧其反應將何似？就彼憧憬於對華者而言，日軍在廣西，雖有重兵而格於祟山峻嶺，不能進窺雲南；但自越入滇，自滇越鐵路被中國拆毀後，無法行軍蓋與自桂入滇相等，或且過之；察日方宣傳機構之所吐露，彼志不在軍事進取，而在政治陰謀；顧以吾人所知，必有事實確答陰謀之無效，亦即使日本雖得越南而無所得於對華。對華終於一籌莫展，則其盤據越南，自非另覓藉口不可矣。若自越南脅阻英屬緬甸在十月間恢復對華運輸，則逼使英國取舍於一途之間；拒絕日本此項要求與威脅而發生磨擦與衝突，一途也；與美國之並行協作相脫輻而對日屈服，又一途也；事未可知，但以前一途為允可能；然則日本將恣為之乎？抑確得在越南恣為之乎？若自越南南窺菲律賓與荷印，西窺緬甸且捬新加坡，則戰綫在越南乎，在甫海或南海之東乎？凡此四者，俱見越南協定不足以確定日本在越南之前途，越南前途蓋在未定之天</p>

<p>關於法國屈服的內幕和貝當政府的組織，本報巳經發表了好幾篇譯稿，茲冉將紐約泰晤士報駐歐通訊員和曼哲斯德街報前任駐巴黎訪員最近報告，譯錄如下：</p>
<p>八月十日，記者屬此稿，不禁憶及法國局勢急轉直下以迄於今之三個階段。三月前，德軍在西錢採取攻勢；二月前，法政府自巴黎逃亡；一月前，法國國會授權貝當政府，開始其精神上物質上之復興工作。迄至今日，法國大局究當如何耶？</p>
<p>法國改造工作，現巳着手進行，其所揭　之口號有三，卽「工作，家庭，國家」是也。法國民衆對此皆無異議，特用何種方法完成復興工作，則意見不無分歧之處。</p>
<p>法國當今最嚴重之問題，足以阻碍其復興工作者，亦有多端：半壁河山，仍為德軍盤踞，一也；英德兩國戰爭狀態，依舊存在，且以法國土地為一部份戰塲，二也；非得停戰委員會之核准，百廢不得一興，三也；仍有難民數百萬，亟待遺返故鄉，四也；被俘法兵的二百萬人，頹唐萎頓，亟待交涉釋回，五也。</p>
<p>事變之經過，先後僅三閱月，然千變萬化，身經其境者，大有隔世之感。而法國民間，迄未完全明瞭刧難之慘痛程度者，實大有人在。各處城鎮鄉村，難民充斥，貧困交侵，或則迷惘不知所措，或則自顧不暇，對日後問題，實已無心關懷。</p>
<p>政府當局所施行之種種限制，亦足令人充分瞭解大局之嚴重。煤油甚少，運輸食物致極困難。勞工缺乏，農產遂告歉收。鐵路，公路，橋樑，工廠，破壞不堪。法國人對於靑年擔仟改造工作，期望甚殷，顧靑年亦須領導有方，指派得宜，始能大有作為。</p>
<p>况法國現巳分成淪陷區與非淪陷區，種種復興工作，因乃益趨複雜。貝當政府切欲自維希遷回巴黎，蓋貝當政府全力辦事，迄未奏效，乃知非在中心地點，一切行政不能集中，而所謂中心地點者，卽指巴黎而言。一月前，貝當上將曾向全國廣播演說，謂正與德方談判，俾政府得遷回凡爾賽或巴黎。然法政府迄今仍在維希，閣員大吏，侷說旅邸，舉凡辦公接客膳宿等等，莫不在此。終日閒蕩，無所事事，轉而以造謠妄談為務者，比比皆是。</p>
<p>貝當政府擬在此次全國和平的革命中，進行根本上改造計劃，然改革辦法，大多須恢復全國之統一，始能實施。今日之局面，僅係停戰，並非恢復和平也。</p>
<p>然則德國對法態度又何如乎？德國豈擬摧毀法國，或因貝當政府之能唯命是聽，準備予以容忍乎？抑擬以更傾向國社黨者取而代之，不許法國有自治及「比較的獨立乎？凡此種種，德國政策尚未決定，或須視對英戰爭進展如何為定。但就德方邇來關於法國情形所發出之無綫電廣播研究之，巳可灼見德方之態度及意中央響矣。</p>
<p>德方廣播之內容，恒以聽衆為轉移，其在法國淪陷區內所控制之電臺，日以法語廣播，德力本國電臺則以德語廣播，並以外國語向中立國播音，內容大相懸殊。其以丹麥語播音者曾謂：「對英戰爭告終前，德法兩國或可奠定和平。」其對羅馬尼亞播音，則陳述巴黎迅速恢復原狀情形，歷歷如繪。</p>
<p>然德方向本國播音，語調大變，對於法人，仍多鄙責之辭，目謂德國不能信任法人。德意志電臺陳述巴黎情形，且謂人跡罕見，市民仍流浪於洛亞河與庇里尼斯山之間。該電毫並喜爰引希特勒所著「余之奮鬥」一書中得意之筆曰：法國人猶黑人，乃種族上不純潔之民族，對白種人的歐洲，乃一侮辱。其對維希政府始終鄙視，迄至最近，尚謂絕不能信任「老奸巨滑」云。</p>
<p>其更可驚異者，法國淪陷區德方電毫之法語播音，會宣傳反對維希政府，某電臺告法人曰：「新憲法之頒行，竟未商諸法國民衆，舊憲法雖不免陳舊，但對許多人民，仍有價值……法國人民其接受此等政治的把戲，以挽救國家乎。」該電毫並會於七月十三日向法國勞工階級廣播，叙述希特勒政府如何消滅德國失業，規定最低工資及例行假期等情形，誘使法國工人入殼。</p>
<p>要之，德方刻正施展分化法國之技倆，旣已誘使貝當左右屈服，今乃嗾使法國人民，允其是巴黎居民，不服從貝當政府。千方百計以國社主義之種種「民治性」，利益引誘法國工人階級其他法人。</p>
<p>法國未淪陷區無綫電臺所廣播之新聞，幾全屬德國官方通訊社發出之反英消息。苟有親近美國之言論，卽迅遭抨擊，如法外長波多恩日前向美國聯合通訊社訪員談稱，法國新憲法，實與美國憲法相類似云云，立卽引起德方廣播電臺之反駁曰：「波多恩豈圖粉飾其非獨攬大權者，而欲結歡美國人，冀其援助乎。」諸如此類，貝當政府對內對外，應付眞不易矣。（上）法國國民會議在維希加西諾戲院表決廢止共和　（下）德國軍官在巴黎議院聆聽希特勒廣播演說</p>

<p>有軌電車增開四輛</p>
<p>法租界各路有軌電車、昨日仍由隨車越捕保護下勉強行駛、惟昨日開出車輛、較前日已增加四輛、二路昨開出的十輛、七路的六輛、十路亦增至六輛、惟昨日因二路七路在上午俱發生不幸事件後、各路車輛、為確保乘客安全起見、將車上玻璃窗一律關閉、車頭車尾上、亦不准乘客站立、以防意外、</p>
<p>昨日上午三度衝突</p>
<p>昨日上午六時許、有法租界電車公司罷工工人手持鐵棒石灰等武器、在各處阻止臨時行駛之電車、（第一次）發生在辣斐德路、當時罷工工人五各手持鐵棍、強迫賣票人停車、車上武裝巡捕、卽下車將工人拘獲、至（第二次）數分鐘後、呂班路又有罷工工人糾察隊三十人、阻止一電車前進、並以鐵棍擊碎車上玻璃、另一批則向司機人攻擊、附近巡捕巡邏、當將暴動工人拘獲、內中有工人一名、腰部受傷甚重、因當時巡捕被迫、不得不開放手槍、而巡捕亦有被工人以鐵棍擊傷者、（第三次）襲擊事件、發生於上午八時四十分、地點為霞飛路維爾蒙路轉角、當時有罷工工人一名、從路旁衝出、將石灰拗擲於司機者之面上、賣票員則當塲逸去、有乘客二人、誤被石灰擊中、至投擲石灰者、則已被隨車保護之巡捕所拘、經過多次襲擊後、現隨車保護之巡捕、業已增至三人、聞法租界電車工人九百名中、巳有三分之一赴公司恢復工作、</p>
<p>一售票員傷勢甚危</p>
<p>雙方衝突時、有售票員張永康、年十八歲、槍彈由臀部射入、洞穿腹部、傷勢危殆、梁家崔傷右足、現均住廣慈醫院醫治、尚有其餘四人、僅受臂部輕傷、經包紮後離院、聞張永康家中僅一老母、早寡、昨日聞得消息、不勝悲痛、趕至廣慈醫院探視、又聞昨日因阻止電車行駛而被拘捕之工友四十餘人、現扣留於呂班路電車廠內、</p>
<p>當局竭力進行調處</p>
<p>公共租界工部局對公用事業之電車及公共汽車工人罷工、以事關界內交通、非常重視、除嚴密保護電車公司及公共汽車公司外、為求早日解決罷工風潮起見、巳由工業科會同政治部將設法進行調處、但如何進行、正在考慮之中、至於華董虞洽卿·袁履登·等雖未接得工人之請求出任調處、但希望勞資雙方各自讓步、迅謀合理之解決、以免影響社會之安寗、及市民之感受極度不便、租界內中外人士亦盼交通事業迅謀合理之解決、</p>

<p>證劵暗盤、昨市忽因中美借款二千五百萬元成功而大漲、市價本孕育在游資充裕中、極為安穩、經此新借款之成立、不啻增加強有力之培補、漲勢益覺有勁、此次上漲恐難免又將超越九月十日高價而見新高價、昨日上午、因多方為力為優、經德孚大通聯和信孚等在怡泰潤德同康各家賣出中潛滋暗漲、午收卽好起二三角、午後忽聞中美借款、一千五百萬美元成立、人心驟見興奮、市上買氣更見踴躍、永大進胃最佳、更以金子大多數看小、公債市塲人心更見熱烈、永生信孚鴻大及六號等紛紛買進、丙種穿出六元、而接近七元、價乙種衝出八元、甲種穿出五元扶搖上騰、聯和德孚雖有吐出、仁昌公茂亦有斬結、但供求相殊甚遠、故結果回漲六七角至一元、成交的一百五六十萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>

<p>昨日洋米市轉趨平穩、良以一般投機家雖藉越南問題、尚圖蠢動、但洋米來源迄未中斷、致實銷觀望、大戶反有出籠、惟一般空頭乘機補空、所以進出互見、結果形成定局、二號現西貢仍在六十五元八角至六十五元二角之間、二號暹邏六十四元、六十三元八角、小絞六十三元八角、六十三元半、頭號洋米仍無正市、卽英華司二號西貢亦以原槃七十七元開出七十五噸、現洋米則不足四千包、惟港越交通巳斷、今日難保投機米商不掀波作浪也、</p>

<p>麪粉昨日廠盤則站定未動、連日盛傳各洋行所訂巨額洋粉、巳得覆電證實、計有木街行商向洋行訂購澳洲洋粉二十餘萬包、每包合國幣約十六元八角、的於十月至十一月間運滬、較滬市粉價相差一元以上、故粉市漲風賴以抑平、回籠貨市而頗受影響、昨開老車棧單二百包、價十七兀五角半、洋砲台十八元五角、雙鳳十八元二三角、均比前盤跌小半元左右、按目下滬存洋粉業巳大量轉口、所剩無多、而新定洋粉到期尚遙、人心猶堅、華廠出口之老車福新牌現粉、供給依然有限、各粉號零售處高掛「無貨牌」、聞今日起各廠巳開始儘量供給、但未知能否實現、</p>
<p>小麥昨日堅靜如故、速日內地供給、殊感稀少、日廠未放價吸收、華廠則又有洋麥續定、新到洋麥亦有存積、故需要更不暢旺、統市交易僅一二千包、售價暫無變動、</p>

<p>上日在漲之紗市、今則依然猛升疾退、此種局面、全係投機商做作不一、因此市盤顅簸靡定、實則有許多謠言旣已過去、且都屬無稽之談、不足置信、所以某大戶等鑒於港帮納胃巳飽、採辦轉趨寂寞、且三日以來、已連升一百四五十元、乘大家心思看好、價格在高檔時大量的出籠、籌碼一鬆、乃呈閃電式的回挫、前途若何、殊不敢下、因多方力量依然在堅強中、</p>
<p>現紗晨開人氣非常熱烈、大家喊進不叫出、二十支雙馬價為一千一百十八元、跳二十餘元、然買者依然擁擠而來、賣戶不盛、再升至一千一百二十元、此時大戶紛紛出檔且額量殊巨、一般浮戶及搶帽子從速吸進、旋後多頭仍有吐出、同時聞金價下降、謠言利空、市價又復向低、步步下墜、跌至一千零七十四元、但檯面上抬聲復起、又升至一千零八十五元、卒以浮多因時點已到、且大勢不靈、祇得了結、續疲至一千零七十五元收盤、查半日間成交統計四千零五十包、行情二十支雙馬跌十五元、今日有棉紗一百九十件運烟臺、一千五百七十五件運香港、茲將各帮口買去之額量、分列如左、</p>

<p>另訊、外棉市價、紐約棉市、日來殊形活躍、昨日又因同業之購買而上漲、一般俱望政府棉花押軟之有實現可能也、結果收盤價格、較之上日　五六磅音、印度連同頂測亦漲一羅比餘、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、昨日較呈靜寂之狀、然廠方仍有進胃、同業閒則以市上存底不豐、擬待善價出售、故暫時抱觀望態度、同業間手無現貨者、頗有意購買、竟有無貨可購之概、</p>

<h3 id="c86">該恥笑的是社會 <a href="#c86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>— 趙美琪</p>
<p>我是一個中學生，因為戰事而淪為舞女，舞女不是很下賤的嗎？其實這下賤並不是天生的，同時他們解決經濟的艱難後，還有精神上的苦痛，所以我寫了這篇來使社會認識一下舞女的本心，並且希望舞客不要當舞女不是人啊！</p>
<p>舞女不是人做的，的確是件離去人性的事，不過誰又生來是舞女呢？以我講就是一個很普遍的例，三年前我未嘗不是一位小姐！雖不能說是錦衣玉食，但衣食是無用憂慮的。自從戰後轉輾來滬，滿望能够找到一塊安全土，其實世界上那兒又是安全的呢？一箇有母親，姊姊的快樂家庭逐漸感到長安居不易了，因而展開我不堪的命運，那是常然的一會事！</p>
<p>我是一個情感過人的女子，談不上希特勒式的理智，事實上這是很艱難的一件事，當然亦是一件最痛苦的事了？因為我是一個「人」啊！但是却怕着過於忠寶的受騙，我和這們多的男子接觸，有的是把多最的金錢來買我的歡心，有的獻着小殷勤使我高興。可能的在這周圍的一華中有極少數是出於眞心的，在我自己當然亦需要一位愛人，一位眞心的愛人，因為我還不能把人性减去萬分之一啊！精神上的苦惱，亦就產生了，判別每個舞客的心，根本我還沒這經騐：就是能够，你能不敷衍不歡喜的人嗎？你敢討厭他們嗎？你自己總明白做舞女不是來找愛人的。於是不願笑亦得笑，不願跳亦得跳，反正又沒人當舞女是人啊：違反着情感做人世閒最痛苦的事就是舞女，同時肯為我用錢是眞心愛我嗎？那麼沒有錢的就不够來愛我嗎？年靑的是油滑的，那麼老年的是吾忠實呢？這一類疑難每每在淸靜時使我感到空虛，更體味着人生的殘酷！</p>
<p>最幸福的（這亦祗可認為幸福的事）就是我不是一個「湯團舞女」，所以在經濟上很可寬心，自有一批認為歡迎而並不歡喜的人來捧我，並且我自己知道節儉，我很少穿綢衣服，因為布衣並不使他們遠離，在這裏我很希望做舞女的能够多節儉些，這樣我們可以很快離開為錢而做舞女的目的，相同的亦就楚超脫自己！</p>
<p>以上的話，是以我自己個人的情形環境來談，不過在上海千百的舞女中，和我同情形的一定很多。我們怕社會恥笑嗎？不，該恥笑的就是社會！</p>
<h3 id="c87">巫人之害 <a href="#c87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>— 鈞相</p>
<p>生長於封建的，迷信的社會中，為一般迷信「因果」的愚民「服務」的巫人之類，據說在周秦之前卽開其端了。那時女的巫人稻「巫」，男的巫人稱「覡」，統稱「巫覡」，它只不過用於「樂神」及「招魂」兩椿事上，於人類還沒有什麼直接的重大的害處。</p>
<p>到後來，巫人的「樂神」一項工作，讓給和尚道士去做了；人死之後，丟在棺材裏拉倒，也不再請巫人來「招魂」了（古時人死後，一定要行一次「招魂」的儀禮，實在「招」不到，方信其乃眞死，可以放心埋掉）；小孩生了一點小毛病，不過山家屬提了燈籠，到小巷中去喊幾聲「某某，歸來呀！」而巳，也不用來請教巫人了。</p>
<p>照這樣說來，巫人實在無工可作，大可以不滅自滅了；然而，可悲的是：巫人却仍然很自山地滋生於封建的，迷信的社會中，非但沒有點消滅的趨勢，而且他們竟聯合着來做患害社會的工作了，這不能不令人萬分憤怒。</p>
<p>最荒唐，最害人的那就是巫人的所謂捉鬼醫病」。自然，巫人們是沒有什麼醫學常識的，一個病人上了門，經巫人「鬼畫符」了一會，便斷定是碰着了什麼「邪神」或是前世的對頭寃家。一邪神」須得「正神」去降服它，而對頭寃家則宜解不宜結，於是由巫人去把「正神」請來，附在自己的身上，再鬼鬼祟祟了一會，算是把與病者作祟的「邪神」之類的東西捉除了；之後，就包一點香灰（他們稱「仙丹」）給病者，算「大功告成」了。</p>
<p>香灰並不能致人於死地，可母庸議，但一個病人的病經了巫人的躭擱，不去請可靠的醫生來醫治，而至不救的却在在皆是。</p>
<p>近來滬西「歹土」上盛行種「花會」的賭博，這惡毒的勢力竟至蔓延到租界上的每一個角落，因此一般巫人最近叉多了一種各為「扛筒」的騙錢工作了。「扛筒」者，卽是由巫人去把什麽「大仙」請到，附在身上，令一般「花會」的賭徒跪在地上，請「大仙賜筒」：「大仙」在叫了一會，就提起筆來寫幾句不倫不類的「詩謎」，令那些賭徒自己去猜。據我向各「花會」賭徒得來的訊息說，他們卽使依着那「詩謎」猜了，十之九仍舊是打不着的，但賭徒們却不怪「大仙」不靈，只怪自己猜得不準，眞令人對他們要哭笑不得了。</p>
<p>此外，巫人還有什麼「關夢」的生意。據說卽是由巫人直接去把死者的魂魄招來，附在自己身上，跟死者的親人談話，——這自然又是一種騙錢的勾當，在新社會中是不成立的。</p>
<p>巫人是大騙子，是以人命為兒戲的正兇，是推動「花會」盛行的鼓勵者，它之為害社會誠是非淺；然而，直接去制止，剷除巫人，實在並不是一個最根本的辦法；最根本的辦法乃是向這一部份迷信鬼神的大衆灌輸新教育，使他們從封建迷信的舊社會中跑出，走向新的社會上去。等到封建迷信的舊社會完全趨於滅亡的時候，則那些患害社會的巫人便沒有立足之地，不滅也要自滅了。</p>
<p>霍桑探案</p>
<h3 id="c88">舞后的歸宿 <a href="#c88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>— 程小青著</p>
<p>第八章　捉住了兩個人</p>
<p>說也可笑，霍桑的手槍也正抵住在趙伯雄的胸口，故而前後夾攻，已使他沒有動彈的可能。不過萬一他或我當眞開槍，槍彈透過了趙伯雄，霍桑或我一定也要分嘗餘味。我不能不佩服霍桑的機敏。他分明早已覺察門外有人，等到趙伯雄在外面旋門鈕的時候，霍桑大概巳先伏在門後，故血等門一開，他就立刻把趙伯雄控制着，使他沒有發槍的可能</p>
<p>霍桑的笑聲終了以後，便伸出左手，將趙伯雄右手裏的手槍迅速地奪去。他用一種愉快的聲浪說道：「趙先生——唉，孫先生，請進來。」同時他把自己的手槍也收了回去。</p>
<p>我覺得那趙伯雄並不接受霍桑的邀請，仍不進不出地僵立在門口，幸虧這時候這部份的房間並沒有人出進，吾則這種狀態自然會引起意外的紛擾。我把槍口抵著趙伯雄的脊骨，用力向裏面一推，使他不能不移動他的脚步。我也跟著進云，反手將門關上，我到了裏面，我的手槍仍舊抵住在地的背部。這完全是出於小心起見。因為我覺得趙伯雄的身材比我高出很多，他的肩膊的闊度也像超出霍桑，如果徒手搏鬥，我們兩個人要制服他，也免不掉要有相當的麻煩。霍桑正在察騐那支奪得的手槍的彈囊。</p>
<p>一回，他點點頭說：「正是，這裏還有七顆，子彈口徑是〇·四五米厘，那少掉的兩顆，一顆是打王麗蘭的，一顆是你孝敬我的。趙先生，對不對？——唉，你今天是叫孫先生，明天也許會姓李，反正都是化名，我就稱你趙先生罷。好不好？」</p>
<p>我把槍管漸漸移動到了他前面的腰部。我瞧見趙伯雄那雙濃眉底下的可怕的眼睛，發射出一種有殺人可能的兇光，凝視在霍桑臉上。他的嘴唇緊閉着，越顯得他的下頷的方闊。他也和先前的余甘棠一樣，取着靜默的態度，但他的神氣上却沒有恐懼的樣子。</p>
<p>（一一九）</p>
<h3 id="c89">寫字間裏的一羣 <a href="#c89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>— 恭儀作文羅孝莘作畫</p>
<p>電車罷工的談話會</p>
<p>今天寫字閒裏的空氣為之一變，除了經理先生的兒子之外，誰都沒有到外面去吃中飯，有幾個同事是帶着乾糧來的，其餘的也都喊茶房買些點心來充飢。天下雨自然是大原因，但受了電車罷工的影響也不小吧？</p>
<p>在午後兩小時的休息時間內，總是「電影」和「戀愛」作為談話的課題的，今天却不的而同地集中在罷工事件上。</p>
<p>打字的小李最先開口：一到今天才知道坐汽車的舒服，有了汽車不是可上「第第」去吃飯嗎？」</p>
<p>「坐黃包車去也祗要一隻洋，比軋司林還便宜呢。」</p>
<p>不知誰在盥洗室里抬槓了。小李想反抗，却沒有可辯的理由，於是，嚕咕着：「吃一頓飯祇要兩塊半……」</p>
<p>新來的練習牛剛在角落里　完麵包，他也揷嘴了。</p>
<p>「對於我是不生問題的，平常也是走路的時候多，吃飯更馬虎了……」說到這里，他覺得一個新職員不該多說多話，就自圓其說地，「不過，也太苦了！」</p>
<p>「不過也有你的便宜呵！」盥洗室裏的那個聲音又來了，「平時遲到要吃排頭，現在遲到可推說電車罷工了。」</p>
<p>哈哈哈……一陣笑聲使練習生漲紅了臉。</p>
<p>穩重的會計先生就出來做排難解紛的和事老：</p>
<p>「別開玩笑，我們也得自己打算打算，如果罷工延長的話，問題多着哩。……」</p>
<p>「是的，這話言之有理，」小李點着頭，「不過，照今天報上的消息看來，租界當局是在竭力想辦法，我想雙方談判總能够接近的。」</p>
<p>練習牛又接嘴了，「其實罷工是兩敗俱傷的，現在的公司再也不會像從前那樣的固執了，現在的工人更知道顧全大局，如果沒有枝節問題，我也想是不會延長的。」</p>
<p>「但願如此，每天的車錢眞叫人吃不消啊！」</p>
<p>跑街先生剛從外面進來，由他來結束了談話，因為辦公時間到了。</p>

<h3 id="c91">模範明星喬治勃倫　不喜交女友生性孤獨　無不良嗜好專心影業 <a href="#c91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>— 新方</p>
<p>喬治勃倫（George　Brem），在今日好萊塢的銀壇上，雖然還不能够列入為十大明星之一，可是他演技的精湛已是有口皆碑。喬治勃倫的個性方面，有幾點是與一般普通影星不同的；他不喜歡跟女性接近，而願意過孤獨的生涯，在公衆的宴會上，是從不曾看到他有女伴的。其次，他不喜歡把自己的名字常常披露於報瑞，不愛出風頭，為了這些緣故，如有新聞記者要訪問他時，總是不能如願。</p>
<p>一位個性奇特的人，往往在生活上必定同樣會帶幾份奇特的喬治勃倫亦何嘗不如此呢！每夜就寢時，有一只他所寵愛的小犬陲在他的身旁，睡室的門是決不會不上鎖的。此外，另有一個傳聞，說當他年幼的時候，因為在夜間睡眠前，聽了他保姆所講的各種愛爾蘭的鬼怪故事，所以直至現在，他最害怕的是在黑暗中做事或睡覺。說到飲食，他沒有最愛吃的東西，如果要嚴格地來講，那麽是牛排及浜格的餅類。他在影城外，有一所很精美的別墅，但他自己祇稱它是一所茅屋」，這一點亦使人覺得很怪。</p>
<p>總之，在好萊塢是找不到第二個像喬治勃敦這樣神秘的人物。但他有一處特長，在影圈內亦是唯我獨尊」，就是他沒有不良的嗜好，對於電影工作知道專心求進取；有暇時，拉梵亞林及下棋是唯一的消遺，不正當的娛樂從不顧問：的確藝人是應該抱有他這種精神，纔會成功的！</p>

<p>— 唯唯</p>
<p>更新舞台自吳素秋遲世恭等出演以來，記者曾三度往視，對於諸角所獲印象，錄之如後：</p>
<p>吳素秋與上次南來相較，確有進步；非僅嗓音較前響亮，演戲已能竭力體會劇情，且注意身上與表情。因此所演諸戲頗能動人。惟台步過份學荀，宜改之。素秋聰敏過人，設能得名師指點，三五年後，必冠於儕輩，不難成雪艷琴第二也。</p>
<p>遲世恭　路數絕對正確，嗓音雖不甚響亮，但唱唸韻味十足；好在出科未久而竟能晚净火氣，良非易易。富連成所產生之鬚生多宗馬連良，獨世恭並無馬之成份；有謂其唱唸近譚富英者，實際世恭確學自余叔岩。稍待時日，共嗓音再趨結實，則可證實此言。世恭做不如唱，武工不知如何？蓋出演以來。猶未見共露演靠把戲也。</p>
<p>傳德威　晚近武生欲求一全才人物，頗不多得。傳德威有扮相，有嗓子，有功夫，尚不失一全才人物，德威之戲，自以靠把戲，勝於短打，而鈎臉戲，更勝於凈臉。或謂德威藝宗小樓，實不如說他學尚和玉來得妥當。今人武生莫不以「楊派」標榜，演老尚一路戲者極少。德威之戲旣屬於「尚派」，其「功　」乃獨有佳妙矣</p>
<p>關德咸　體胖，扮相頗似已故之鬚生郭仲衡。嗓子甚佳，唱唸並不難聽，做表尚可，不失為一裏子人才。</p>
<p>張蝶芬　扮相秀麗，惜個子稍矮，兩手喜搖盪，殊欠穩重。唸白不分上下，有「一順邊」之弊，一純粹之頑笑且也。</p>
<p>此外尚有劉速榮，李德彬，賈多才等人，因非初次來滬，不復贅述。</p>

<p>賈多才倒是一個五十開外的老角色，演婆子戲是他的一絕。我對於多才的戲，看得最多，而且都很滿意，他的長處，就是能把他所扮飾的人的狀貌口吻，維妙維肖地都活活描寫出來，惡婆是惡婆，媒婆是媒婆，悍婦是悍婦，下流婦人是下流婦人，各齣戲有各齣戲的作風，揣摩功夫，眞是大堪欽佩。「浣花溪」的魚氏，「能仁寺的賽西施，「拾玉鐲」的劉媒婆，一天河配」的嫂子，「孔雀東南飛」的焦母，探親相駡」的胡媽媽，都是他的絕活。</p>
<p>孫盛武是蘇州人，從小生長在北平，所以他能够說一口道地的京片子。他在十來歲的時候，就進富連成坐科，初學老生，後改小丑，畢業出來，就以小丑應工，風頭很是不弱。去年隨着吳素秋南來，正是他立業顯名的好機會，唱了兩個月戲，居然口碑載道，名科雙收。丑角老名票孫履安先生常對我說：孫盛武這小子眞有造化，亦是他該發跡，却巧會逢着你這個伯樂，倘使你不把他弄到上海來，誰曉得後起丑行中有這麼一塊好材料呢？履老的話，一半是捧我，一半亦是實話。</p>
<p>「溫文儒雅，隨機應變，」是盛武演尷的長處，有時臨時鑽鍋，亦很能應付裕如。有一次吳素秋貼坐樓殺惜帶活捉，張文遠一脚，大家都聲明沒有，（梨園中人習用語，就是不會的意思。）結果還是盛武臨時鑽鍋，上得臺去，居然頭頭是道，精彩無比，如果換了別人，非暈塲就得大鬧笑話。他的戲路博的很，是文丑應工戲，他什麼都會，而且什麽都好，他在寶蓮燈劇中去塾師一脚，有許多俏頭，是別人所不及的。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Japanese Troops Landed Near Haiphong Yesterday; Chinese Troops Decided to Advance to the Vietnamese Border to Counterattack; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Instructed the Consul in Hanoi to Evacuate Overseas Chinese and Begin Negotiations with the French Side to Demand Compensation for Losses <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing - According to a Central News Agency report this morning, Chinese troops are prepared to enter the Vietnamese border today to counterattack the Japanese army. The Chinese army is prepared to implement China's previously announced policy of using anti-aggression means to deal with Japan's invasion of Vietnam and defend China. The agency also stated that the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has instructed the Chinese consulate in Hanoi to rapidly evacuate overseas Chinese in Vietnam and begin negotiations with Vietnamese and French officials to demand compensation for all Chinese losses caused by the Hanoi Agreement. (United Press report, 26th)</p>
<p>Haiphong - According to an official announcement, the "accidental incident" that occurred between French and Japanese troops on the northern border of Vietnam has been resolved locally. Japanese troops began landing near Haiphong today. Details are currently unknown. Neither the government nor other parties have made any indication regarding the number of Japanese troops landing. The announcement stating the resolution of the border incident said that the hostile actions between French and Japanese troops on the border have ceased, but unofficial border news reported intermittent gunfire last night and this morning. (Reuters report, 26th)</p>
<p>Chongqing - A Chinese military spokesman stated that Chinese troops are currently waiting for an opportunity to act and said that the establishment of an understanding between China and France to cooperate against Japan is highly possible in their view. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman also stated that Japan's violation of the Hanoi Agreement was due to friction between the Japanese army and navy. He also said that Major General Nishihara's trip to Hainan was Major General Nishihara's expression of goodwill to the Japanese Southern China Army. The spokesman continued that the Chinese army is currently closely monitoring the Vietnamese border, and Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui's announced Chinese self-defense policy has not changed. Regarding the news of the German-Japanese alliance, the spokesman said that he had not yet received an official report, but he was highly skeptical of the possibility of such a fact. The spokesman also said that Sino-Soviet relations are very friendly. (United Press report, 26th)</p>
<p>Chongqing - A Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman announced this afternoon that, regarding the war in Vietnam, as of now, no formal request for assistance has been received from the French government, nor has it been asked whether China would sever relations with the Vichy government if Vietnam were to implement the agreement with Japan. The spokesman replied that because the current situation is still full of various possibilities, China is not planning to take this action at this time. Someone also asked whether the entry of Chinese troops into Vietnam would depend on French approval. The spokesman replied, "No, this action will be entirely based on China's own plan." Someone further asked if Chinese troops entered, would the French resist? The spokesman replied, "That, please ask the French." (Reuters report, 26th)</p>
<p>Liuzhou - The fighting on the outskirts of Vietnam was still ongoing as of 8 PM on the 25th. French troops are concentrating in Cao Bằng at Trà Lĩnh and Mã Phúc Pass, and their follow-up units are also continuously increasing. This war was launched by the Japanese army at noon on the 23rd. At that time, 7,000 Japanese troops attacked Đồng Đăng with fierce firepower, immediately encountering strong resistance from the Vietnamese army. The Japanese army occupied Đồng Đăng that evening, but the price paid was very high. (Report on the 25th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - According to semi-official Japanese sources, the Japanese Southern China Army Headquarters issued a communiqué stating that the Japanese troops traveling to Vietnam by sea have completed their landing near Haiphong without any hostile actions. A spokesman for the Japanese Southern China Army Headquarters announced today that the accidental incident in northern Vietnam on Monday has now been peacefully resolved locally based on a spirit of friendship. According to news from Vietnam, Japanese troops entered Lạng Sơn (transliteration), an important town on the northeastern border of Hanoi, on Wednesday. According to reports, after Lieutenant Colonel Oka of the Japanese army encountered resistance from the Vietnamese army again during the advance from Đồng Đăng, he went to Lạng Sơn yesterday accompanied by a major to meet with Major General Minora, the French commander there, before being able to enter peacefully. (Reuters report, 26th)</p>
<p>Guilin - Li Jishen made a statement to the press on the 24th regarding the Vietnam issue, the main points of which are as follows: (Question) What impact will the Japanese landing in Vietnam have on the future of our country's resistance war? (Answer) It can be viewed from two aspects: (1) From a military perspective, the longer the Japanese roundabout line, the more battlefields, the more dispersed and weaker their forces, which is more favorable to us. (2) From an international perspective, the Japanese have created three enemies in one fell swoop. France will definitely harbor resentment against Japan, which is not difficult to imagine. Even Britain and the United States have repeatedly expressed statements against changing the status quo of Vietnam, but Japan has ignored them and acted arbitrarily. Britain and the United States will definitely conspire to制止之, which is also expected. Then Japan will inevitably suffer the harm of creating enemies and having few helpers. On the contrary, we will gain more help. (Question) After the Japanese land in Annam, will they invade our Yunnan or prepare to advance southward? (Answer) The Japanese are narrow-minded and have weak capabilities. They take advantage of others' difficulties, threatening and intimidating the Vichy government, wanting to seize the fertile land and abundant resources of Vietnam. This is their main attempt and consistent trick. Using a false pretext to disturb us and chanting the slogan of advancing southward is just a temporary excuse and superficial gesture. However, in order to justify themselves, it is expected that they will try to harass our borders. If so, they will suffer a heavy blow, which can also be asserted. (Question) How should we respond to this incident? (Answer) Our response to this incident has sufficient reasons and preparations, which can be found in the meaning of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs' one or two statements. (Report on the 24th)</p>
<p>Hanoi - Japanese troops recently declared that after bombing this morning, Japanese troops had peacefully landed in Haiphong. Officials declared that Japanese planes had flown over Haiphong, dropping four bombs on the indigenous residences near the railway station, killing fifteen people. Japanese vehicles landed in Haiphong this afternoon. The Japanese troops who landed numbered 2,000, and there was also a squadron of tanks. The Japanese landing was carried out in accordance with an agreement concluded between the French and Japanese military authorities. The agreement was signed on Sunday, stipulating that Japanese troops are allowed to land and occupy three airfields in Vietnam. However, this agreement does not affect the situation on the border. Whether Japanese troops in Lạng Sơn will advance towards Hanoi will depend on the efforts of Major General Nishihara, the leader of the Japanese delegation. Major General Nishihara is now strongly urging the Japanese Southern China Army not to violate the terms of the agreement signed on Sunday. (United Press report, 26th)</p>
<p>Local News - There are four locations in Vietnam where Japan requested the establishment of airfields: (1) In the central area, known as Gia Lâm in Chinese, it is only five kilometers from Hanoi. The site has a railway factory on the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway and is the intersection of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway and the Vietnamese State Railway. (2) In the eastern area, known as Phủ Lạng Thương in Chinese, it is 49 kilometers from Hanoi. The railway and highway to Đồng Đăng pass through the area. The airfield is one kilometer northeast of the city, and there are small steamers to Haiphong, making river transport very convenient. (3) In the northern area, A. Known as Phú Thọ in Chinese, it is a major station on the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, 99 kilometers from Hanoi. It is located on the Red River, at the confluence of the 清水江 and the Red River, making water transport very convenient. There are many rice paddies nearby, and agricultural products are abundant. The tea produced is quite famous. The airfield is one kilometer west of the city. B. Known as Lào Cai in Chinese (the Vietnamese characters are 牢該), it is a Yunnan-Vietnam Railway station opposite Hekou, 297 kilometers from Hanoi and 460 kilometers from Kunming (but the aerial distance is only 360 kilometers). The airfield is two kilometers south of the city, on the Red River. (Translated from "Vietnam Tourist Guide")</p>
<p>After Chinese Troops Attacked, There Were Conflicts North of Zhennanguan on the Rear Route of the Japanese Army</p>
<p>Chongqing - A military spokesman declared that after Chinese troops attacked, opening fire on the rear route of the Japanese army entering Vietnam, small-scale conflicts have occurred north of Zhennanguan. It is said that the main force of the Japanese 5th Division has advanced towards Lạng Sơn. Only 1,000 Japanese troops are advancing northwest from Zhennanguan. According to a phone call from Liuzhou, Guangxi, the Chinese side, the Japanese army suffered 1,000 casualties in the Đồng Đăng battle and lost 30 tanks. It is reported that the French side lost one colonel. According to news from Kunming, the French authorities sought the Chinese side's opinion on possible assistance. The situation in Vietnam is still chaotic, and future developments are difficult to predict. The military spokesman said that the Japanese army and navy authorities disagree. The navy supports landing in Haiphong, while the army advocates entering Vietnam from Đồng Đăng. The spokesman strongly emphasized that Sino-French cooperation is quite reasonable, but he did not comment on the claim that the French side would request assistance. (Reuters report, 26th)</p>
<p>The Đồng Đăng Incident Has Been Resolved, and the Agreement Will Be Implemented</p>
<p>Vichy - The latest news received here regarding the situation in Vietnam indicates that Japanese representative Nishihara has successfully resolved the Đồng Đăng incident caused by Japanese troops crossing the border. It is widely believed here that the current situation will allow the implementation of the Franco-Japanese agreement. (Reuters report, 27th)</p>
<p>Vichy - Regarding the Vietnam issue, according to the latest news, Japanese General Nishihara has almost completed his mission. Although the northern border area of Vietnam has not yet fully returned to normal, General Nishihara has done his best to ensure that the agreement reached between France and Japan on the 22nd of this month can be implemented. The dispute that occurred on the northern border of Vietnam was actually caused by the Japanese army in Guangxi Province, China, attempting to enter Vietnam. There is now reason to believe that this dispute has been resolved. (Havas report, 25th)</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Surrounded Lạng Sơn with a Large Force; French Troops All Withdrew</p>
<p>Hong Kong - According to an official French announcement that arrived here this morning, after the French troops in Lạng Sơn were surrounded by superior Japanese forces, they withdrew yesterday and deployed their new defense line. The Japanese army fully utilized the French order prohibiting its soldiers from firing, using its mechanized units to attack the flanks of the French army and threaten its rear. According to official news that arrived here late, the French army was in a dilemma and had no choice but to withdraw from the threatening encirclement without firing a shot, redeploying a new defense line west of Lạng Sơn. The French military leader in Vietnam still hopes for a solution, calling the border conflict between the French army and the Japanese Southern China Army an "accidental event." Official news from Hanoi stated that Chinese troops have not crossed any point on the Vietnamese border. Some sources here expect that 35,000 Japanese troops will disregard any protests and prepare to enter Vietnam to fight. Because the strength of General Ando, commander of the Japanese Southern China Army, far exceeds that of the French army, informed sources here believe that Ando will disregard French opposition and instructions from Tokyo, planning to send his troops from Guangxi Province to occupy Vietnam. (International News Agency report, 16th)</p>
<p>Hanoi - According to a declaration made here last night, Japanese troops occupied Lạng Sơn, a key town on the railway and highway in northern Annam, yesterday. It is reported that the Japanese army first surrounded Lạng Sơn with a large force, forcing the French garrison stationed there to withdraw. Last night, a French official also issued a statement saying that about 30,000 Japanese troops participated in the attack on Annam. Although the French army wanted to delay the Japanese action, it was only temporary. French officials here said that the war on the northern border was an "accidental event." Officials are still hoping that this incident can be resolved peacefully. They stated that they are still negotiating with Nishihara, the leader of the Japanese delegation. According to reports, Nishihara traveled to Guangzhou this week to try to prevent the attack by the Japanese Southern China Army. As for reports that Chinese troops can enter Vietnam at any time, French officials here have not confirmed this. Yesterday, women and children continued to evacuate from Hanoi, Haiphong, and Đông Hới. It is reported that Đông Hới is a seaport 90 miles south of Haiphong, where Japanese troops may land. (United Press report, 26th)</p>
<p>If Japan Continues Unreasonable Oppression, the United States Will Expand Aid to Vietnam</p>
<p>New York - The New York Daily News recently stated that French Indochina is prepared to resist any Japanese oppression beyond the scope of the Franco-Japanese agreement signed in Hanoi on Sunday. It is reported that Colonel Jacques Mey, the representative of the Vietnamese government, has flown from Washington to Hanoi to inform the local authorities that if Vietnam can mount a resolute and effective resistance to Japanese oppression, the United States government will provide Vietnam with all possible assistance, except for sending troops to fight. The newspaper also stated that the French mail ship "Île de France," which was seized by the British after the fall of France, is carrying a division of Free French troops from Africa and is heading to Vietnam. The newspaper also stated that Colonel Jacques Mey, while in Washington, asked the United States to help Vietnam with 150 aircraft, as well as cannons and military supplies, and advocated that American planes be sent to Vietnam from the Philippines. (United Press report, 26th)</p>
<p>Vichy - The French government here declared last night that the Franco-Japanese war on the northern border of Annam has ceased. The French Ministry of Foreign Affairs also stated that Nishihara, the leader of the Japanese delegation in Hanoi, has made considerable progress in negotiating a halt to the attacks by the Japanese Southern China Army. Before the above declaration, the French government had said that the fighting in Vietnam yesterday had continued throughout the day. According to French reports, officials in Tokyo and Vichy are still unable to understand the cause of the border fighting. The French newspapers believe that this may have been caused by local conflicts and will not escalate into a military operation. Yesterday, many barges transporting Japanese troops were found in Haiphong. It is reported that French officials issued a warning that if Japan violates the Hanoi Agreement signed last Sunday, France will resist. (United Press report, 26th)</p>
<p>British Imperial Airways Suspends Operations Between Hong Kong and Vietnam</p>
<p>British Imperial Airways announced that due to the tense situation in Vietnam, all operations between Hong Kong and Vietnam are temporarily suspended, pending a further announcement after the situation calms down. The company announced yesterday that all operations except airmail would be temporarily suspended. Now, even airmail will be suspended. (Reuters report, 26th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3 id="e2">The Fate of Vietnam <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Before yesterday, French Indochina had briefly shown a glimmer of vitality; after the Franco-Japanese agreement was signed, Japanese troops suddenly pressed on Lạng Sơn. The French troops considered it a violation of the agreement and resisted; at the same time, some French officials declared that the agreement had been cancelled due to the Japanese violation. This situation excited those around the world who cherished France. We also gladly encouraged it, but yesterday's editorial discussed it, saying, "This does not mean that the French Vietnamese authorities have fundamentally repented. If the Japanese side can rein in its actions and abide by the agreement, taking what is allowed by the agreement as a starting point for further actions in the future, then it may not be impossible to obtain the rights and interests it demands in a relatively mild manner; while the French Vietnamese authorities are worried about the harm of the cold alliance, and it is not difficult for Japan to make progress." It also pointed out that, observing the various announcements issued by the French Vietnamese authorities "recently, one can only become more pessimistic about their future." As today's news shows, the editorial was unfortunately correct; the resistance war was like a flash in the pan, and the French troops withdrew from Lạng Sơn; the semi-official news from Vichy even said that "Japanese General Nishihara has almost completed his mission. Although the northern border area of Vietnam has not yet fully returned to normal, Nishihara has done his best to ensure that the agreement reached between France and Japan on the 22nd of this month can be implemented. The dispute that occurred on the northern border of Vietnam was actually caused by the Japanese army in Guangxi Province, China, attempting to enter Vietnam. There is now reason to believe that this dispute has been resolved." The expression of their eagerness to surrender is obvious, and the past reasons for attributing the compromise to the lack of assistance from Britain and the United States are increasingly seen as mere excuses.</p>
<p>The nature and situation of the French Vichy authorities are pitiful and not worthy of blame, which is self-evident. As for the future of Vietnam, it is still uncertain and not something that the Vichy authorities can dominate; whether to preserve it or defend it, Vichy cannot accomplish it; even to divide it or ruin it, Vichy cannot control it. Is this intentional belittling? It is because the international situation after the outbreak of war is such that the fate of countries that have become problems is determined after the final competition; since the transfer of power to Vichy, France has given up its role as a member of the final competition. If the Vichy government does not change its current domestic and foreign policies, then its fate depends on the victory or defeat of Germany and Italy, and also on the likes and dislikes of Germany and Italy after their victory in the final competition. Vichy's foundation is still unstable, let alone the agreement it signed, and even less the Vietnam that the agreement can hardly control.</p>
<p>Why is Vietnam not controllable by the agreement? First, although the signing of the agreement went through negotiations, the entire negotiation was shrouded in threats; therefore, the establishment, implementation, destruction, modification, addition, and abolition of the agreement are not bound by the actual effect of the agreement; however, observing that the agreement was signed and those who violated the agreement fought to defend it, but Vichy acknowledged that the dispute had been resolved after they abandoned Lạng Sơn; this one example shows that the value of the agreement is equal to zero: in short, the agreement is the agreement, Vietnam is Vietnam, and the threat of action is always the threat of action, and they are not related. Second, the internal situation in Vietnam is very complicated due to repeated changes; from the outbreak of the European War to the present, the Governor-General has been changed three times and the system is very different. The current Governor-General is loyal to Vichy, but as a naval admiral, he also leads the army. The army is under his jurisdiction but has a commander who has been in office for a long time, so there are bound to be conflicts in nature and divisions of power. Moreover, is it during the time when freedom and surrender are in open and secret struggles? In recent days, there have been rumors that the army and the people have been very active, arranging things everywhere and brewing such a situation. The success or failure has not yet been determined. When the time is right, can a piece of paper agreement and several government orders be enough to limit it? Third, matters on the East Asian continent will ultimately be decided by China's intentions; matters in the Western Pacific will ultimately be decided by the struggle between the United States and Japan: Vietnam is a corner of the East Asian continent facing the Western Pacific. Japan is now seizing the opportunity and its momentum is aggressive. The Franco-Japanese compromise cannot be interfered with by third countries; therefore, the key to the problem lies in whether the United States will be deterred and remain silent from now on? If not, what is the value of a piece of paper agreement obtained by Japan from the Vichy system compared to gold coins and iron ships? Fourth, even in the near future, if all parties do not take effective and active measures against Japan and Japan is allowed to seek its own desires, what will be the reaction? As far as those who yearn for dealing with China are concerned, the Japanese army in Guangxi, although it has a large force, is hindered by high mountains and steep ridges and cannot invade Yunnan; but entering Yunnan from Vietnam, since the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway was demolished by China, there is no way to march, which is equal to or even worse than entering Yunnan from Guangxi; observing what the Japanese propaganda machine has revealed, their ambition is not in military conquest, but in political conspiracy; but as we know, there must be facts to confirm the ineffectiveness of the conspiracy, so that even if Japan obtains Vietnam, it will not gain anything in dealing with China. If dealing with China ultimately proves to be a failure, then its occupation of Vietnam must be for another excuse. If Vietnam is used to threaten British Burma to resume transportation to China in October, then Britain will be forced to choose between two paths; refusing Japan's request and threat and causing friction and conflict is one path; cooperating with the United States and deviating from the orbit and surrendering to Japan is another path; the matter is unpredictable, but the former path is more likely; then will Japan act arbitrarily? Or can it really act arbitrarily in Vietnam? If Vietnam is used to look south to the Philippines and the Dutch East Indies, and west to Burma and Singapore, then will the war be on the Vietnamese front or in the East of the Gulf or the South China Sea? All four of these show that the Vietnam agreement is not enough to determine Japan's future in Vietnam, and Vietnam's future is uncertain.</p>

<p>Washington – President Roosevelt today formally ordered that all steel exports, except to Britain and the countries of the Western Hemisphere, be banned. This embargo will take effect on October 15th. The general interpretation here is that President Roosevelt's ban on steel is the second major act of retaliation by the United States against Japan for its actions in Vietnam, while the $25 million loan to China announced yesterday was the first economic strike against Japan.

<p>Washington – President Roosevelt has summoned Vice President Garner and other senior officials to Washington for important consultations on the current situation in the Far East. Garner, who has been in Texas since July 28th, is expected to arrive tomorrow and will immediately meet with the President and other government leaders to discuss what steps the United States can take in the Pacific. It is understood that the Vice President's sudden decision to return to Washington was at the urging of a close friend of Roosevelt. Roosevelt has requested Garner's return to attend a meeting to be held here within two days. Informed observers predict today that the government will spend the weekend deciding on definite diplomatic actions to cope with the new Far East situation arising from the Japanese invasion of Vietnam. Secretary of State Hull is in daily contact with the President, discussing the Pacific crisis. It is rumored that they are planning a definite policy that will not hinder the presidential campaign. Regarding the rumor here that Germany is attempting to form a military alliance with Japan, senior government officials said that the United States may be forced to abandon its policy of watchful waiting and decide on a definite stance, one way or the other, regarding the crisis in the Pacific. It is rumored that Secretary of State Hull is considering imposing further economic pressure on Japan. Recently, it was also reported that the Italian radio broadcast a message claiming that the US fleet had moved to Singapore. This has been denied by a spokesman for the US Navy, who said that the fleet must report to the Pacific coast, one-third at a time, for inspection. This order has not been changed. As for the rumors that Admiral Hart, commander-in-chief of the US Asiatic Fleet stationed in China, and Captain Baker, commander of the US Navy in Shanghai, are planning the evacuation of Americans from the Far East, there has been no comment here. (United Press dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>Washington – Personnel at the US State Department, because of news coming from around the world such as Madrid, Vichy, Hanoi, Shanghai, etc., all believe that the situation in the Far East is rapidly heading towards an emergency, so they held meetings all day today. The atmosphere was extremely tense. Official sources hinted that the United States, under Roosevelt's leadership, could abandon its policy of watchful waiting at any time and adopt a definite stance towards the rapidly deteriorating situation in the Far East. However, news from Europe to Washington officials has further complicated the already chaotic situation. It is said that Spain and Japan are being wooed by Germany and Italy to participate in their planned military programs. For Spain's cooperation with the Axis's world plan, it is expected that Germany and Italy can use diplomatic means at any time to make it more extreme, and Mr. Stammer, an East Asia expert from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, is currently visiting Tokyo to discuss with senior Japanese officials, what is being discussed is Japan's role in the German and Italian plans. According to news received by the State Department, Germans arriving in Shanghai said that Head of State Hitler is currently putting pressure on Japan to form an alliance with Germany.

<p>New York – The New York Min Sheng Jiang Tan Bao recently published an article saying that Japan's current actions are leading to a conflict with the United States. The newspaper stated that Japan is now engaged in a completely immoral opportunistic undertaking, which will cause Japan to conflict with the United States in a short period of time. (United Press dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>Washington – US Secretary of State Hull told the press yesterday that he had not heard that US Ambassador to Japan Grew had been recalled. Hull has firmly refused to comment on the situation in Vietnam since condemning Japan's invasion of Vietnam. The press also asked him to comment on the rumor that the Japanese-German defense alliance had reached an agreement in principle. Hull said that he expected all the facts would be realized at the appropriate time. Hull said that because the situation around the world is developing very rapidly, new developments often require more time to wait for official confirmation. (United Press dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>New York – "Scripps Howard Newspaper" Director Howard yesterday expressed his support for the United States using the British-owned Singapore naval base. In his long serial article "30,000 Mile Pacific Air Travel," he claimed that the United States' use of the Singapore military port could change the "entire current situation" in the Pacific and prevent the Philippines from being coveted by Japan. He also stated that if Britain and the United States could station a strong fleet in Singapore, the Japanese war, which is "currently in a stalemate," may have hope of an early and reasonable resolution. He also stated that before using the Singapore military port, the United States may adopt a "long-term policy" in the Pacific, including considering various issues such as Japan's needs and the United States' maritime defense forces. (United Press dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>Tokyo – The Miyako Shimbun recently published news from Washington, saying that the United States' policy towards the Far East will be a historic decision, and it is feared that US Ambassador to Japan Grew may be recalled. The newspaper continued, stating that President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull, in view of Japan's destruction of the status quo in Vietnam, expect that the United States will adopt a strong policy towards the Far East, and there is absolutely no such thing as deciding to withdraw from the East. Several articles by Howard in New York on the Far East issue have aroused great attention from the Japanese press. An article in the Asahi Shimbun stated that Howard advocated that the United States stop Japan's southward advance. The article also recalled that Howard had said that any compromise by the United States with Japan would be seen as weakness by Tokyo. However, the Yomiuri Shimbun believes that Howard's articles did not attack Japan, but only requested that the Roosevelt-led administration reconsider its Far East policy. The Yomiuri Shimbun stated that President Roosevelt should be held responsible for the serious situation in the Pacific. (United Press dispatch, 26th)</p>
<h3 id="e4">McNutt Urges Loudly: Aid Countries Under Aggression <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Washington – US Federal Security Administrator McNutt, in a speech to the American Legion convention last night, said that the United States must fight in Asia and Europe to help those who have been invaded, and launched a sharp attack on those who advocate that the United States ease up on Japan. It is said that it is the will of the American people and the will of the American government to decide on American policy to aid countries resisting aggression. This policy is not only applied to the European continent, but also to the Far East. Compromising with Japan will never increase the security of the United States. He also said, "If any country decides to unite with countries whose mission is to undermine international security, how can we benefit from cooperating with these countries?" The United States has always tried to maintain friendly relations with Japan and other countries in the Far East, Latin America, and Europe based on fixed and good principles, but it has become increasingly difficult to maintain friendly relations based on these principles. He stated that the United States must make a firm decision as to whether it will completely withdraw from the Far East or continue to shoulder the responsibility for Far East policy. He then indirectly mentioned the reconsideration of the issue of Philippine independence, which he had advocated two years ago, saying that the smart policy for the United States is to maintain the status quo of the Philippines and adopt a warlike Far East foreign policy, and not to build a new American outpost in the Pacific. "The scope of our country's territories in the Pacific is from the Aleutian Islands through Hawaii to Samoa, and from the eastern continent through Hawaii to Wake Island, Guam, and the Philippines. The focal point of the great cross formed by these islands is our mark in the Pacific." He also opposed the suggestion that the US defense area should retreat to the east of Hawaii. The resources of the Western Hemisphere, especially those of South America, are an integral part of the economic life of the Old World. Attempts to incorporate the New World into Asian or European political organizations have been going on for many years. If we want the Western Hemisphere to be isolated, we must recognize what its true meaning is. This is to maintain a military construction sufficient to protect any part of the New World at any time, but it is also to give up many markets that need our country's agricultural products. Any attempt to build a wall around the New World will have as great an impact on the United States as war itself. We must remember that once the war ends, this isolation will plunge us into a situation from which we will never recover. (United Press dispatch, 26th)</p>

<p>London – According to reports from Washington, an agreement in principle on a German-Japanese defense alliance was reached in Tokyo this week. Although this report attracted the greatest attention in London yesterday, British officials have not made any criticisms. However, British officials indicated that their refusal to make any criticisms was not because the report was untrue. According to prevailing observations here, various preparations have already been made between Tokyo and Berlin to have Japan come out to restrain the mobilization of the US fleet in the Pacific. It is said that in return for Japan's assistance, Germany will supply Japan with munitions and will use its power with the Soviet Union to ensure that munitions can reach their destination via the Siberian Railway. According to yesterday's report from Washington, Japan and Germany, in order to resist the expected joint British and American front in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, have already reached an agreement in principle on a German-Japanese defense alliance. As for the purpose behind this alliance, it is said to be a German proposal, intended to divert the attention of the United States so that the United States cannot give its full strength to Britain to provide substantial assistance.

<h3 id="e6">US Continues to Loan Money to China: $25 Million Gold Dollars; China Believes This is a Manifestation of Aid to Resist the War; Hopes to Reopen the Burma Road to Transport Tungsten Ore to the US <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Washington – According to official documents here, the US government has loaned US$25,000,000 to China to maintain China's foreign exchange needs. The document was released by Mr. Jones, chairman of the Economic Revitalization Committee. He said that the new loan to China will be handled by the semi-official Export-Import Bank, and said that the United States has decided to purchase tungsten worth US$20,000,000 from China. This purchase of tungsten will be purchased by the Chinese National Defense Council and stored in the United States for the needs of US national defense. Mr. Jones also said that the US$25 million loan will be directly loaned to the Chinese government and guaranteed by the Central Bank. The debt will be offset by the price of tungsten sold to the US. (United Press dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>Chongqing – Official sources here recently recognized that the new US loan to China is a manifestation of the United States helping China resist Japan, but at the same time, China is quite worried about whether it can transport tungsten ore to the United States. According to Mr. Jones, director of the US Construction Post Company, the US$25 million loan is the third loan to China by the US Export-Import Bank. China will repay this debt with tungsten. Chinese officials said that because the Burma Road is blocked, China's tungsten cannot currently be transported to the United States, so the Burma Road must be reopened. Chinese officials also said that the loan was made at the time when the Japanese army entered Vietnam, which shows the United States' dissatisfaction with Japan's southward advance. (United Press dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>Tokyo – All newspapers here have recently published Washington dispatches in prominent positions about the United States' assistance to China with new loans, but none of the newspapers have published any comments. However, the large headline published by the Asahi Shimbun is quite sufficient to express the opinion of the people, and the headline states: "Retaliatory Anti-Japanese Actions and Helping General Chiang." Before receiving the Japanese newspapers from Washington, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs also did not make any comments on the US loan to China. (United Press dispatch, 26th)</p>

<p>German Aircraft Drop Many Tons of Bombs, Destroying Several Buildings</p>
<p>London – After being relatively inactive for the past two days, German aircraft flew again yesterday to launch fierce attacks, dropping many tons of high-explosive bombs and incendiary bombs indiscriminately, causing significant damage to London and Bristol. London suffered its 124th air raid since the start of the war yesterday. Citizens took refuge in air-raid shelters, searchlights illuminated the sky, and anti-aircraft guns also opened fire fiercely, deafeningly. Many famous buildings in London were damaged by German aircraft indiscriminate bombing, such as the United Press Association building, a world-famous church, an Indian student dormitory, and the famous Selfridges department store. The company's building, built in the West End of London, has become one of "London's wonders" in recent years. Bristol was attacked, and bombs were dropped on the coastal suburbs, causing some material damage and some casualties. There was also some German aircraft activity in southeastern England. It is reported that the loss of life and property in that area was minimal. The attacking German aircraft were intercepted everywhere by British fighter planes. Officials recently announced that 23 German aircraft were shot down, including three shot down by anti-aircraft guns. One British fighter plane, initially reported lost, reappeared safely, so yesterday the British side only lost four fighter planes, of which the pilots of three planes jumped out of the planes and were not killed. Most of the German aircraft were shot down over London. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>Canadian Air Force Squadron Participates in Air Battles Against Germany</p>
<p>London – A Reuters Air Force correspondent stated that the "All-Canadian" squadron of fighter pilots organized in the British Air Force in England has been protecting London with excellent results. In the past two weeks, the squadron's fighter planes have engaged in six battles, destroying a total of 55 German aircraft. The German Air Force has thus lost 140 personnel, while the Canadian pilots involved in the operation have only lost two. On September 18th, the "All-Canadian" squadron assisted friendly aircraft in giving a major blow to the German bomber squadron that attempted to sneak into London during the day. This time, the "All-Canadian" squadron and Spitfire hurricane-type fighters took part in the battle outside the mouth of the Thames River, encountering two large groups of enemy aircraft at an altitude of 17,000 feet. They first dived and fiercely attacked the first tightly formed team of twenty German bombers, and soon shot down nine German Dornier aircraft and five Junkers 88 aircraft. On September 7th, when German aircraft launched a major attack on factories, docks, and railways in the London area, the Canadian squadron took off from eastern London and attacked the large group of enemy aircraft all the way to the coast, shooting down four Dornier bombers, six Messerschmitt fighter-bombers, and two single-seat fighters. On September 15th, when German aircraft launched a major attack, the "All-Canadian" squadron and the first squadron of the Canadian Air Force to arrive in England joined the British Air Force in shooting down 185 enemy aircraft, setting a new record. Recently, Canadian aircraft have also joined British aircraft in several battles against the enemy. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>London – According to an Air Ministry bulletin, after a hurricane-type fighter plane shot down a German aircraft over a certain town in Kent, it was also hit by enemy aircraft fire, caught fire, and fell. However, in order to prevent the plane from falling into a nearby village, the pilot still drove the plane obliquely to the south of the town before climbing out of the plane, suffering minor head injuries. A short while later, the plane's fuel tank exploded. The residents of the town, feeling the pilot's courage and disregard for his own safety, began to raise funds to purchase fighter planes. On the afternoon of the same day, after shooting down one or two enemy aircraft, a British squadron leader's plane was also destroyed, so he descended by parachute and landed near a certain town in Kent, injuring one foot. His whole body was soaked in gasoline. While bandaging his wound, the police displayed his parachute in public and began raising money to present it to the authorities for the purchase of Spitfire fighter planes.

<p>German Special Elite Troops Prepare to Invade Britain</p>
<p>Berlin – According to semi-official sources here, "super soldiers" who have been specially selected, trained, and equipped will be used to attack Britain. It is reported that these elite soldiers have been distributed along the North Sea coast, the English Channel coast, and the Atlantic coast, mixed in with the regular army. These soldiers were sent to their current locations after undergoing intense training before September 20th. The training of these soldiers began after the end of the war in France. These soldiers were selected from various armies. During the selection, military officers asked the selected soldiers 63 questions. The questions included sports skills, knowledge of foreign languages, specialized skills, and familiarity with the geography and personnel of Britain. It is reported that tens of thousands of infantrymen and marines among them have been able to skillfully use the so-called "ice skates," wearing these shoes to glide on the water surface, being able to glide 9 kilometers per hour. According to reports, these ice skates are made of cork, 2 meters long and 50 centimeters wide. This method was invented by General Sick, a former military advisor to the Chinese government. General Sick had seen Chinese athletes perform water surface gliding in the Yangtze River. After returning to China in 1936, General Sick told German Navy Commander-in-Chief Admiral Raeder about this technology. Until a few months ago, this technology was adopted by the German Navy Department. However, German technicians have improved the Chinese model, and now the so-called "ice skates" have been manufactured by countless shoe workers. These shoe workers had originally stopped working when the war broke out, but now these water-skiing shoe factories have been reorganized and are carrying out large-scale manufacturing. Because of the large-scale use of cork, cork stoppers for thermos bottles have been in short supply for several months. (United Press dispatch, 26th)</p>

<p>Vichy. The British fleet outside the port of Dakar in French West Africa ceased fighting at noon yesterday. According to reports from French reconnaissance aircraft, the fleet sailed south yesterday afternoon. Furthermore, during yesterday's fighting, the British battleship HMS Resolution was hit by three French torpedoes at noon, and the battleship HMS Barham was hit by several shells from the French battleship Richelieu's 350mm guns. It is noted that the British side had claimed that the Richelieu was sabotaged with mines in July this year while undergoing repairs in the port of Dakar, rendering it unable to sail. However, judging from yesterday's naval battle, it is clear that the ship is completely unharmed. (Havas News Agency, 26th)</p>
<p>London. General de Gaulle, the leader of the "Free French Forces" considered to be assisting Britain, suddenly withdrew his British-led joint army from the port of Dakar yesterday. The joint army fought fiercely with the French forces defending the port of Dakar for three days. Casualties on both sides were significant. This British expedition may have been completely abandoned, as indicated in a British communiqué. (International News Service, 26th)</p>
<p>Vichy. Authorities here issued a message late in the evening stating that when British ships arrived at the port of Dakar in French West Africa, the dismissed General de Gaulle also went along and issued an ultimatum to the Governor-General of West Africa, Isong. However, he indicated that if persuasion failed, he would withdraw, and subsequent battles would be conducted by the British army, with which he personally did not want to be involved. Therefore, those who attacked the port of Dakar yesterday morning were actually the British Navy, not de Gaulle's troops. (Havas News Agency, 26th)</p>
<p>London. The British Intelligence Department has issued a statement declaring that in order to preserve French lives and avoid fratricide, the troops led by General de Gaulle are currently withdrawing from Dakar. It stated that the British government never intended to fight those Frenchmen who felt obliged to obey the orders of the Vichy government. General de Gaulle, based on the information he received, had good reason to believe that the majority of Frenchmen in French West Africa supported the Free French movement and welcomed his arrival, thus establishing the same situation as in French Equatorial Africa. De Gaulle therefore proposed to the British government that, with British goodwill and assistance, he would lead some troops to West Africa. The British government, having received intelligence that German forces were gradually spreading to Dakar, naturally agreed to this proposal. When de Gaulle's troops set off, the Vichy government sent three cruisers from Toulon through the Strait of Gibraltar to Dakar. If the French warships did not sail to any port under German control, the British government did not want to interfere with their actions. For this reason, the British side allowed the French warships to pass through the Strait of Gibraltar and proceed south without obstruction. The French warships then sailed to Dakar, but the French warships then sailed out again and continued south, attempting to interfere with the situation in French Equatorial Africa. The British fleet then blocked their advance and instructed them to change course. Thereupon, two French warships obeyed and turned back to Dakar, and one was escorted by a British warship to Casablanca due to engine damage. On the morning of September 23, de Gaulle sent representatives with the French tricolor flag and a white flag to land in Dakar, expressing their French nationality and peaceful intentions, but they were fired upon and seriously wounded. The Dakar artillery first opened fire on de Gaulle's warships and then fired on the British warships alongside. The British warship commander gave a clear signal before returning fire, stating, "If the firing does not stop, we will return fire." However, the coastal fire did not stop, and the British warship returned fire. Both sides suffered casualties, and the French battleship Richelieu also assisted the coastal artillery in firing. Therefore, the British warship also bombarded it. The British warship commander also warned that if French submarines left the port, the British warship would strike them hard. Three French submarines ignored the warnings and attacked the British warship. The British warship had no choice but to respond. As a result, two submarines were sunk, but all personnel of one submarine were rescued and will be sent back to France as soon as there is an opportunity. De Gaulle's troops attempted to land but were unsuccessful, indicating that Dakar could not be captured without a large-scale battle. At this point, it was decided to cease hostilities because the British government did not want to wage a fierce war against those who felt obliged to obey the Vichy government. General de Gaulle himself was also extremely unwilling for his countrymen to shed blood as a result. Therefore, this army is currently withdrawing from the territory of Dakar. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<p>Vichy. Regarding the battle for the port of Dakar in French West Africa, the Naval Department issued a communiqué this evening, stating: "British naval and air forces suddenly attacked the port of Dakar and the coastal defense batteries along the coast yesterday (September 24), as well as the Richelieu battleship docked in the port. In addition to shooting down three British aircraft, our side also dispatched bomber groups to attack the British fleet. A British cruiser was hit by our aircraft. In addition, when our warships engaged with British warships, they fired and hit the British battleship HMS Barham (31,000 tons) and HMS Resolution (29,000 tons), and also hit a British "Kent" class cruiser (9,850 tons). British warships launched another attack at 10:00 a.m. this morning. Our side used torpedoes to hit a British battleship, which immediately withdrew from the battle line."

<p>Madrid. The second long talk between Spanish Interior Minister Suner and Führer Hitler has attracted great attention in political and public opinion circles here. Newspapers say Spain has reached a critical juncture, that events are developing rapidly in 1940, and that new events will occur soon. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>Berlin. Regarding yesterday's talk between Führer Hitler and the Spanish Interior Minister, the official announcement stated, "The Führer received Spanish Interior Minister Suner at noon on Wednesday for a long talk. German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop was also present." The content of the talk is being kept strictly secret by officials. (Haitong News Agency, 26th)</p>
<p>Berlin. According to well-informed sources in Berlin, the talk between Führer Hitler and Spanish Interior Minister Suner at noon on Tuesday was extremely important in terms of military, diplomatic, and political matters. Diplomatic and political arrangements can be generally seen from the talks of the German Foreign Minister in Rome. Although the results of the talks have not been announced, they will be known in the future development of the political situation, and the one most affected is Britain. Foreign newspapers' descriptions of the diplomatic and political activities of the Axis powers as "reviewing the scope of diplomacy and discovering conflicts of interest among the Axis powers" are ridiculous. According to sources in Berlin, German-Italian cooperation is based on ideals and is not limited by time, and there is no difference in friendship between their politicians, so there is no room for conflicts of interest. What is generally being discussed here is the extent to which Suner's talks in Berlin involve the scope of Axis diplomatic politics. On Tuesday, German authorities told foreign reporters that Foreign Minister Ciano of Italy would come to Berlin in the future, and during Suner's stay in Berlin, a kind of public matter would be decided, which cannot be announced at present. However, the German side strongly stated that Suner came to Berlin not as the Spanish Interior Minister, but as a special envoy of Commander-in-Chief Franco and representing him. It is also not certain how long he will stay in Berlin. (Haitong News Agency, 26th)</p>
<p>Rome. According to the "Roman People's Daily," the negotiations between Spanish Interior Minister Suner and German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop in Berlin are the beginning of cooperation between Spain and the Axis countries and will have a significant impact on Africa.

<p>Regarding the inside story of France's surrender and the organization of the Pétain government, this newspaper has already published several translated articles. Now, we will translate and record recent reports from the New York Times' European correspondent and the former Paris correspondent of the Manchester Guardian:</p>
<p>August 10th. As the reporter writes this, I cannot help but recall the three stages of the French situation's rapid decline to the present day. Three months ago, the German army launched an offensive in the west; two months ago, the French government fled Paris; one month ago, the French parliament authorized the Pétain government to begin its spiritual and material restoration work. As of today, what will become of the overall French situation?</p>
<p>France's reconstruction work is now underway, and the slogan it proclaims has three elements: "Work, Family, Country." The French people have no objection to this, but there are differences of opinion on what methods to use to complete the reconstruction work.</p>
<p>The most serious problems facing France today, which are sufficient to hinder its reconstruction efforts, are also numerous: First, half of the country is still occupied by German troops; second, the state of war between Britain and Germany still exists, and French territory is part of the battlefield; third, nothing can be rebuilt without the approval of the armistice commission; fourth, there are still millions of refugees who need to be returned to their hometowns; and fifth, two million captured French soldiers are demoralized and need to be negotiated for their release.</p>
<p>The changes have taken place in just three months, but those who have experienced them firsthand feel as if they have lived through a different era. However, there are still many French people who do not fully understand the extent of the calamity. Towns and villages everywhere are filled with refugees, suffering from poverty, or confused and at a loss, or too busy taking care of themselves to care about future problems.</p>
<p>The various restrictions imposed by the government authorities are also sufficient to make people fully understand the seriousness of the situation. There is very little kerosene, and it is extremely difficult to transport food. There is a shortage of labor, and agricultural production has declined. Railways, highways, bridges, and factories are severely damaged. The French people have high expectations for young people to take on the task of reconstruction, but young people also need proper leadership and appropriate assignments to be able to make a significant contribution.</p>
<p>Moreover, France is now divided into occupied and unoccupied zones, which further complicates various reconstruction efforts. The Pétain government is eager to move back to Paris from Vichy because the Pétain government has been working hard but has not achieved results. It is now clear that without being in the central location, all administration cannot be centralized, and the so-called central location refers to Paris. A month ago, General Pétain gave a nationwide broadcast speech, saying that he was negotiating with the German side to allow the government to move back to Versailles or Paris. However, the French government is still in Vichy, and cabinet ministers and senior officials are cramped in hotels, where they take care of everything from office work to entertaining guests to meals and lodging. Many spend their days idly wandering around, doing nothing, and instead focusing on spreading rumors and making wild claims.</p>
<p>The Pétain government intends to carry out a fundamental reform plan in this national peaceful revolution, but most of the reform measures must be implemented after the reunification of the country. Today's situation is only an armistice, not a restoration of peace.</p>
<p>So, what is Germany's attitude towards France? Does Germany intend to destroy France, or is it preparing to tolerate it because the Pétain government is willing to obey orders? Or does it intend to replace it with someone more inclined to the National Socialist Party, and not allow France to have autonomy and "comparative independence?" The German policy on all of these things has not yet been decided, or it may depend on how the war against Britain progresses. However, a study of the recent German radio broadcasts about the French situation reveals Germany's attitude and intentions.</p>
<p>The content of German broadcasts always changes according to the audience. The radio stations it controls in the occupied areas of France broadcast in French daily, while German radio stations broadcast in German and in foreign languages to neutral countries. The content varies greatly. The one broadcasting in Danish said, "Before the end of the war against Britain, Germany and France may be able to establish peace." The one broadcasting to Romania described the rapid restoration of Paris to its original state, vividly.</p>
<p>However, the tone of German broadcasts to its own country has changed greatly. It still uses many words of contempt for the French, saying that Germany cannot trust the French. The German radio station described the situation in Paris, and said that people are rarely seen, and citizens are still wandering between the Loire River and the Pyrenees Mountains. The radio station also happily quoted Hitler's得意之筆 from his book "Mein Kampf": The French are like blacks, an ethnically impure people, an insult to white Europe. It has always despised the Vichy government, and until recently, it still said that it could never trust the "cunning old fox."</p>
<p>What is even more surprising is that the French-language broadcasts of the German radio stations in the occupied areas of France have been promoting opposition to the Vichy government. One radio station told the French people: "The promulgation of the new constitution was not discussed with the French people. Although the old constitution is inevitably outdated, it still has value for many people... Will the French people accept these political tricks to save the country?" The radio station also broadcast to the French working class on July 13, describing how the Hitler government eliminated unemployment in Germany, stipulated minimum wages, and routine holidays, etc., to induce French workers to join the shell.</p>
<p>In short, Germany is now using the trick of dividing France. After inducing Pétain to surrender, it is now inciting the French people, allowing them to be residents of Paris, not obeying the Pétain government. It is using all means to attract the French working class and other French people with the various "democratic" benefits of National Socialism.</p>
<p>The news broadcast by the radio stations in unoccupied France is almost entirely anti-British news from the official German news agency. Any remarks that are close to the United States are quickly criticized. For example, French Foreign Minister Baudouin recently told a reporter from the Associated Press that the new French constitution is very similar to the American constitution. This immediately aroused a rebuttal from the German radio station: "Is Baudouin trying to whitewash his non-dictatorial powers and win over the Americans, hoping for their help?" Things like this make it very difficult for the Pétain government to deal with both domestic and foreign affairs.

<h3 id="e30">All Parties Eager for Traffic to Resume, Labor Strife Gradually Easing, Municipal Chamber of Commerce Sends Letter Requesting Reasonable Solutions, Both Labor and Management Show Sincere Intentions <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>Following the strikes by workers of the British-owned Shanghai Electric Tramway Company in the Public Concession, workers of the British-owned China General Omnibus Company, and workers of the French-owned Water and Electricity Company, trams and buses in the two concessions, except for the trams in the French Concession, which are barely maintaining traffic under the protection of armed police, have been completely suspended, causing extreme inconvenience to the citizens. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday specially sent a letter to the Public Works Department, Shanghai Electric Tramway Company, and China General Omnibus Company, stating: Respectfully, trams and buses are the only means of transportation in the city. Since the recent successive strikes and suspensions of traffic, the citizens have felt extremely inconvenient. At a time when prices are high and the cost of living is breaking the highest record since the opening of the port, various banks and major companies in the city have separately added rice subsidies and extra allowances to their employees and workers, so that all employees and workers can be free from family worries and serve with peace of mind. Trams and buses are public utilities, which are closely related to the vital interests of citizens, and are above all industries. In this extraordinary period, everything that can induce social unrest should be avoided by all means. This is the common responsibility of Chinese and foreign citizens within this boundary, and also the responsibility of your bureau (company). Therefore, a special letter is sent for consultation, hoping that your bureau (company) will advise the two companies to seek a reasonable solution to the above-mentioned strike incident as soon as possible. This is our sincere hope. (Referring to the above-mentioned matters, we hope that you will find a solution to the various demands of the employees within the possible scope as soon as possible.)</p>
<p>Tram Workers Sincere in Negotiations</p>
<p>After the workers of the British-owned Shanghai Electric Tramway Company went on strike on the 20th of this month, although there were two direct negotiations between labor and management, they did not reach a satisfactory solution due to the issue of wage increases. Trams on various lines within the concession are still suspended. The strike committee has resolved to ask the Industrial Section and the Political Department of the Public Works Department, as well as Chinese Directors Yu Qiaqing and Yuan Lvdeng, to mediate. However, reporters from the Xin Sheng News Agency visited Yu Qiaolao and others yesterday morning, and they all said that they had not yet received a formal request from the workers. However, the company hopes that the workers will send representatives to negotiate again, because the point of contention is only four yuan different. If both parties can negotiate in good faith, it will not be difficult to find a solution. Therefore, it is generally expected that a solution may be found within two or three days. It is also heard that there was a clash between striking workers demonstrating and White Russians at the head of the tram company's factory yesterday morning, but this has not been fully confirmed.</p>
<p>Bus Company Agrees to Talk Again</p>
<p>After the workers of the British-owned China General Omnibus Company went on strike on the 24th, the company publicly responded to the 23 demands put forward by the workers one by one. It is heard that the workers have sent a letter to the company, setting a date for direct negotiations again. Therefore, negotiations may be held again today or tomorrow. It will not be difficult to resolve the strike turmoil soon. As for the headquarters and factory on Connaught Road, because the location is in the Italian military defense zone, the Italian garrison has deployed strict protection. The striking workers have strictly maintained order, so no unfortunate incidents have occurred in the past few days. However, in order to avoid the deterioration of the labor strife and damage to the relationship between labor and management, the company has temporarily suspended traffic on all bus routes, but expresses its deep regret to customers. All buses are completely parked in the main factory on Connaught Road.</p>
<p>Labor and Management Did Not Negotiate Yesterday</p>
<p>After the workers of the French-owned Water and Electricity Company went on strike, the striking workers had already put forward 16 conditions for improving treatment, but the company had not yet received a formal submission from the workers. However, at 7:00 a.m. yesterday, two people claiming to be representatives of the union went to the company to meet with the Traffic Manager, requesting effective protection for the mechanical workers, but they did not put forward any conditions. However, according to the company's statement to the Xin Sheng News Agency reporter, the two people were not workers of the company. Another message said that the workers of the French tram company had sent four representatives to visit Fafley, the general manager of the French Water and Electricity Company, at 11:00 a.m., to submit 16 demands. Fafley immediately ordered the workers to negotiate with the Traffic Superintendent (Westerner) and translator Guo at 4:00 p.m. The workers sent six more representatives to meet the Traffic Superintendent at the headquarters on Kangti Road on time, but they refused to meet, so negotiations were impossible.</p>
<p>Four More Trams Added</p>
<p>Trams on various lines in the French Concession were still running reluctantly yesterday under the protection of accompanying police. However, the number of vehicles that departed yesterday was four more than the previous day. Ten vehicles departed on Route 2 yesterday, six on Route 7, and Route 10 also increased to six. However, yesterday, after unfortunate incidents occurred on Route 2 and Route 7 in the morning, all vehicles on all routes closed the glass windows on the vehicles for the safety of passengers, and passengers were not allowed to stand on the front and rear of the vehicles to prevent accidents.</p>
<p>Three Clashes Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>At around 6:00 a.m. yesterday, striking workers of the French Concession tram company, armed with iron bars, lime, and other weapons, blocked the temporary trams running in various places. (First incident) Occurred on Lafayette Road. At that time, five striking workers each held an iron bar and forced the ticket seller to stop the car. The armed police on the car immediately got out of the car and arrested the workers. (Second incident) A few minutes later, 30 members of the striking workers' picket line on Lvbantang Road blocked a tram from advancing and smashed the glass on the car with iron bars. Another group attacked the driver. Nearby patrol police arrested the rioting workers. Among them, one worker was seriously injured in the waist. Because the police were forced at the time, they had to open fire with their guns, and the police were also injured by the workers with iron bars. (Third incident) The attack occurred at 8:40 a.m. at the corner of Xiafei Road and Vilmont Road. At that time, a striking worker rushed out from the side of the road and threw lime on the driver's face. The ticket seller fled the scene. Two passengers were accidentally hit by the lime. The person who threw the lime was arrested by the police protecting the car. After many attacks, the police protecting the car have now increased to three. It is heard that one-third of the 900 tram workers in the French Concession have returned to the company to resume work.</p>
<p>A Ticket Seller's Injury is Very Critical</p>
<p>During the clash between the two sides, ticket seller Zhang Yongkang, 18 years old, was shot in the buttocks, penetrating the abdomen, and his injury was critical. Liang Jiacui injured his right foot. Both are now being treated at Guangci Hospital. There were four other people who suffered minor arm injuries and left the hospital after being bandaged. It is heard that Zhang Yongkang's family only has an old mother, who has been a widow for a long time. Yesterday, when she heard the news, she was overwhelmed with grief and rushed to Guangci Hospital to visit him. It is also heard that more than 40 workers who were arrested yesterday for blocking the trams are now detained in the tram factory on Lvbantang Road.</p>
<p>The Authorities Are Making Every Effort to Mediate</p>
<p>The Public Works Department of the Public Concession attaches great importance to the strikes of tram and bus workers of public utilities, because they are related to traffic within the concession. In order to resolve the strike turmoil as soon as possible, the Industrial Section and the Political Department will try to mediate. However, how to proceed is still under consideration. As for Chinese Directors Yu Qiaqing and Yuan Lvdeng, although they have not received a request from the workers to act as mediators, they hope that labor and management will make concessions to each other and seek a reasonable solution as soon as possible, so as not to affect social peace and the extreme inconvenience felt by citizens. Chinese and foreigners within the concession also hope that a reasonable solution will be found for the transportation business as soon as possible.</p>
<h3 id="e31">National Rice Prices Rose Again Yesterday, Imported Rice Prices Remained Stable <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, there were conflicting rumors in the rice market teahouses, and the market situation was volatile. As a result, the price of national rice continued to rise by two yuan. Fortunately, the price of imported rice remained stable at the original level. According to the source of national rice, although transportation was difficult due to the light rain, the amount transported to Shanghai did not decrease. The Xin Sheng News Agency reporter learned from the rice industry yesterday that the source of national rice has increased compared to the previous month. Moreover, in the rice-producing areas, the late rice has gradually headed, and the harvest can be expected. Therefore, there is no possibility that the production price will rise. In addition, the freight has been slightly reduced compared to before. Every stone to be transported to Shanghai can obtain an extra profit of more than ten yuan. As for the Wuhu Xian goods, although the amount transported to Shanghai is not as abundant as before, the local area still allows rice to be transported out of the territory, and rarely interferes with transportation to the territory. Regarding the source of imported rice, there is no possibility of interruption. It is still being transported to Shanghai continuously.</p>

<p>The Public Works Department announced that the office hours of the department and its affiliated departments will be changed to 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and 2:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. from October 1st, and 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. on Saturdays.</p>
<h3 id="e33">The Isolated Battalion Incident Has Been Resolved, the Barracks Have Been Restored to Their Original State, and the Issue of Casualties of Soldiers in the Battalion Will Be Handled Entirely by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>The day before yesterday afternoon, Chinese Directors Yu Qiaqing and Guo Shun, at the request of Cai Ziwei, the Chairman of the Public Works Department, went to the Isolated Battalion to meet with Commander Xie Jinyuan. Currently, everything in the barracks has been restored to its original state. This (26th) morning, the soldiers lined up on the drill ground and were named separately. The guard of the barracks has also been reduced to the original number. In the future, those who want to visit the Isolated Battalion to inquire about matters may enter the barracks in accordance with the regulations.</p>
<p>Not Willing to Say More About Who is Responsible</p>
<p>At 5:00 p.m. yesterday, I went to the Isolated Battalion with a letter of introduction to visit Commander Xie. Xie received me. Xie was in high spirits and still had the same demeanor. In addition to expressing my condolences to him, I asked Xie to make a statement. First, he said, "We are Chinese soldiers. In this complex environment, on the one hand, we must uphold our sacred beliefs and stand, and on the other hand, we must take into account the current environment. We can only use a persevering spirit to weigh the pros and cons and cope with difficulties. As for the occurrence of this incident, if we want to determine who is responsible, I don't want to say more. Only the pain in my heart will always leave a deep impression on my mind."</p>
<p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Will Handle the Aftermath</p>
<p>Xie continued, "Vice President He Dekui of the Public Works Department, following the instructions of Chairman Cai Ziwei and President Felipe, came to the camp three times on the 19th, 20th, 22nd, and 23rd of this month to hold talks, expressing that the situation could be restored to its original state first. On the 24th, Chinese Directors Yu Qiaqing and Guo Shun, at the request of Chairman Cai Ziwei, accompanied He to the camp and expressed to me that the Concession authorities were very willing to restore the Isolated Battalion to its original state, so as not to cause other problems. On the same day, Chairman Jiang also sent a telegram, the content of which roughly stated that the day of serving the country is still long, and in this difficult environment, you can endure any pain that does not hinder the sacred stand of soldiers, so as not to create an excuse for others to provoke, and everything should be based on the overall situation of the War of Resistance against Japan. I obeyed the orders of my superiors, and in view of the sincere intentions of He, Yu, and Guo, I agreed to restore the situation to its original state before September 13th from today. However, the issue of the casualties of soldiers in this camp and the reservation of the right to negotiate, etc., have been completely handled by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Therefore, this solution did not mention any conditions."</p>
<p>Extremely Saddened by the Death and Injuries of Subordinates</p>
<p>When Xie talked about the casualties of soldiers this time, he expressed his deep condolences for the death of Sergeant He Yuxiang of the battalion, saying that Sergeant He was loyal, brave, and capable, and was a model non-commissioned officer. He was only 23 years old, and was originally from Heshan Town, Changsha, Heshan Village. In addition, one soldier who was shot is currently in Renji Hospital, and the bullet has not yet been removed. Three soldiers who were poisoned by gas are currently in isolation hospitals and have not fully recovered. There are also 22 soldiers who were slightly injured and are living in the camp. Doctors come to treat them every day.</p>
<h3 id="e34">After Hepburn Arrived in Shanghai, A Meeting Was Held Yesterday <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>After Admiral Hepburn, Commander of the Asian Fleet, led his fleet to Shanghai the day before yesterday afternoon, people from all walks of life in the city placed high hopes on him, because the defense zone issue, which has been delayed, will be developed because of Hepburn's arrival. According to the Xin Sheng News Agency reporter's investigation, Hepburn is currently living in the 13-story building on Arambei Road in the French Concession. It is rumored that he held a meeting with Colonel Baker the night before, but this could not be confirmed. However, it is believed that Hepburn maintains contact with the diplomatic circles of various countries, exchanges opinions, and makes careful considerations and plans for the US military to take over Zone B. There should be no different opinions. At around 10:00 a.m. yesterday, Hepburn had discussions with the US Consul General and other US military officers, which lasted for more than an hour. Rear Admiral Glasgow, Commander of the US Yangzi River Fleet, was also among them.</p>

<p>The Public Works Department issued an announcement yesterday that it will begin levying the winter house tax from October 1st. The Public Works Department will not send personnel to collect the house tax for Western-style houses. All households should go to the Tax Division at No. 209 Jiangxi Road to pay after receiving the tax notice.</p>
<h3 id="e36">US Funds Support Huaiju, Legal Tender is Further Consolidated, Foreign Exchange is Loose and Gold Prices Fall, Public Bonds Rise and People's Hearts are Settled <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>Since the United States agreed to lend China US$25 million to maintain foreign exchange, and to purchase tungsten sand worth US$30 million from the China Resources Committee, with the Bank of China guaranteeing the loan, after the Shanghai financial market opened yesterday morning, the US telegram confirmed the loan. As a result, speculators first dumped their holdings, the black market for foreign exchange suddenly became loose, the price of gold on the black market fell sharply, and the value of legal tender increased invisibly. It is generally believed that after the success of the loan, the foreign exchange equalization fund committee fund will be more substantial. In addition to making every effort to maintain the statutory foreign exchange, it is expected that the foreign exchange in the Shanghai black market will be authorized to the British HSBC Bank to maintain it again. Therefore, the hearts of the people in the market are more encouraged, and the public bond black market uniformly rises. As for the listing of statutory foreign exchange by the Central Bank, it remains the same as before. It is heard that in the future, the Chinese government will, as far as possible, provide foreign exchange according to the commercial exchange rate of the Communications Bank of China and the Bank of China for the import of essential goods, which will greatly benefit legitimate merchants.</p>
<h3 id="e37">The Company Has Made Preparations, There is No Worry About Interruption of Water and Electricity, Employees Work as Usual and Everything is Peaceful, The Rumors Created by Stock Merchants Are Not Worth Paying Attention To <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>According to reliable sources, since the strikes of trams and buses in the Public Concession and the French Concession, the outside world has been quite concerned about water and electricity. According to the actual situation, the water and electricity companies in the two concessions are currently working as usual. Looking back to 1926, when the Shanghai Waterworks Company had a strike, the company authorities hired unemployed foreign workers to work temporarily, and the water supply was not interrupted. In the future, even if there is a strike in the water and electricity industry, the company will still take the same steps to maintain the water and electricity supply and prevent it from being interrupted. All sectors should not easily believe the rumors and panic themselves.</p>
<p>The Company's Expression is Very Quiet</p>
<p>A Pingming News Agency reporter learned yesterday afternoon that the outside world was spreading rumors about the water problem, so he inquired with the authorities of the Shanghai Waterworks Company. According to them, all employees of the Shanghai Waterworks Company are still working as usual and are very quiet. There is no tendency to brew a strike, so the rumors outside are not credible. It was also learned from sources close to the Shanghai Waterworks Company that the Shanghai Waterworks Company authorities have no problem supplying drinking water to residents within the concession. This is because the company currently has various preparations to ensure that the water supply is not interrupted.</p>
<p>Massive Storage Demand Exceeds Supply</p>
<p>It was also learned from the relevant aspects of the French Concession authorities that the workers of the French Waterworks Company will also strike is purely a groundless rumor. Currently, the company's employees are very loyal to their duties and there are no signs of instability. Residents can live safely within the concession and there is no worry about water cuts. It is also known that when residents in the old district sometimes see the water supply being interrupted, it is because residents are confused by rumors and are storing water in containers, resulting in a phenomenon where demand temporarily exceeds supply. In fact, the French Concession's water supply is sufficient for the needs of residents within the concession and there is a surplus.</p>
<p>Stock Merchants Spread Rumors</p>
<p>Since the trams and buses in the Public Concession went on strike one after another, traffic for citizens has been blocked and it has been extremely inconvenient. Leaving aside the specific discussions, rumors have been spreading frequently in the city recently. Some say that waterworkers will soon join the strike and the water source will be cut off, which will happen in the evening, and some say that employees of the power company also have the intention of making trouble. Various rumors are coming one after another. It is found that these rumors are purely rumors spread by some stock speculators in order to create an intensified situation. There are indeed many people who do this. Yesterday, the price of tram and bus stocks in the market was four or five yuan lower than the day before. At a time when the city is in turmoil, people's hearts are inevitably anxious. The decline in tram stocks is not without reason, but the mentality of speculators is to help seedlings grow by pulling them up. They hope that the price will fall from low to low, and then buy at a low price. When the labor strife ends, the stock price will recover and rise, which is an inevitable trend. These speculators will then make huge profits from this. This kind of intention is very vicious. It is hoped that all sectors of the city will not be fooled by them. It is found that the authorities of the water and electricity companies have long been prepared for the current situation and have made preparations. There is no worry about interruption.</p>
<h3 id="e38">Japanese Ships Leave Zhejiang Sea One After Another, Only One Japanese Ship in Zhenhai Port, Three Japanese Ships and Other Ships in Qijiao Ocean <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>After the Japanese ships fiercely shelled Zhenhai on the 24th, the number of Japanese ships outside Zhenhai Port has decreased since the next day. According to reliable information from the shipping industry: (1) One Japanese ship sailing from the north to the Li Zhu ocean surface outside Zhenhai Port on the 25th at dawn. Including the previous one, there were a total of two ships. At noon, one ship sailed southeast. (2) Four Japanese ships were anchored in Qijiao ocean surface. On the morning of the 25th, three ships sailed to Taicimen, and one ship remained anchored. There was no change. (3) Two Japanese ships on the Shipai ocean surface left northeast in the afternoon of the 25th.</p>
<h3 id="e39">Post Office Transportation Costs Increased Several Times Compared to Before <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>The domestic postage increase proposal, previously submitted by the Ministry of Transportation to the Executive Yuan, was approved at the 483rd Standing Committee meeting. The Shanghai Post Office received a clear order to implement it starting from the 23rd. According to a senior official of the Shanghai Post Office who spoke to the Datong News Agency, since the outbreak of the war, transportation has been disrupted. Mail between the rear and occupied areas mostly needs to be sent via international routes. According to international postal conventions, postal land and sea transportation fees must be paid to each transit country (the regulation is 60 centimes per kilogram for both land and sea, equivalent to 2 yuan in national currency). The costs of various domestic means of transportation, such as fuel and parts, have skyrocketed. The cost of horses and vehicles has also increased compared to before the war, with transportation costs increasing several times. Just considering letters between Shanghai and Chongqing, the postal transportation fee paid per kilogram is 6 or 7 yuan in national currency, while the postage collected is only about 3 yuan. Therefore, the current implementation of postage increases is very reasonable, and the general public will gladly comply and use the stamps.</p>

<p>Since the signing of the Franco-Japanese agreement on the 22nd of this month, the situation in Vietnam has suddenly become tense, and there have been rumors that Japanese troops have landed in Haiphong. According to reliable information from foreign shipping companies, this has not yet happened. Therefore, the Shanghai-Vietnam shipping line has been maintained in recent days. Yesterday afternoon, a foreign shipping company in this city suddenly received</p>
<p>a telegram from Hong Kong stating:</p>
<p>There is news of Japanese troops landing in Haiphong. The Hong Kong-Vietnam shipping line has now been suspended. The Shanghai-Vietnam shipping line should also be changed. Therefore, the Taikoo Company's Qingyuan ship, originally scheduled to set sail for Haiphong from Hong Kong at 11:00 am today, has now canceled the trip to Haiphong and will only sail to Hong Kong. Jardine Matheson's Fusheng ship will arrive in Shanghai today from Haiphong and Hong Kong. It was originally scheduled to sail to Fang, Wan, and Shantou ports on the 29th, but now it will only sail to Shantou port. The Mingsheng ship, scheduled to sail to Fang on October 1st, will now also only sail to Shantou and Hong Kong. Regarding previous rumors that the Hong Kong government is restricting</p>
<p>Chinese entry,</p>
<p>various foreign shipping companies in this city have not received any notification from Hong Kong. Therefore, the procedures for Chinese passengers going to Hong Kong remain the same as before, with no changes. The local Great Eastern and Great Northern Telegraph Companies are still receiving and sending telegrams between Shanghai, Hanoi, and Haiphong as usual, without any obstruction. Moreover, because of the close commercial relationship between Vietnam and Shanghai, there is great concern, and recently</p>
<p>telegram traffic</p>
<p>has increased compared to before, and both outgoing and incoming telegrams are very congested. Also, yesterday a telegram from Hong Kong stated that the British Imperial Airways' Hong Kong-Bangkok flight via Hanoi, originally scheduled to depart from Hong Kong every Wednesday, has been ordered to temporarily suspend carrying passengers to Hanoi due to the tense situation in Vietnam, and will only carry a small amount of mail.</p>
<h3 id="e41">Direct Tax Office Identifies Imitation Chang Stamps, Each Sheet of One Hundred Stamps with Slightly Coarser Printing <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>The Direct Tax Office of the Ministry of Finance received a report from Shanghai merchants stating that a type of two-cent stamp has been found on the market, with one hundred stamps on a sheet, and the printing is slightly coarser. It is suspected to be an imitation and requested identification. The office's identification is as follows: (1) A sheet printed with one hundred stamps is indeed different from those printed by the Ministry. All stamps printed by the Ministry over the years have been in sheets of one hundred. If half of the sheet is torn off, whether it is the upper or lower half, there will always be pinholes on one side. This sheet of one hundred has edges on all four sides and is imitated using a small machine with a hundred-stamp plate. (2) The paper of the hundred-stamp sheet is lighter in weight and thinner in quality, and the paper is different. (3) The patterns and characters on a hundred-stamp sheet are different from the official stamps and are imitated. Since these stamps are imitations, they should be strictly prohibited. Merchants should be notified to prohibit their use.</p>

<p>Eisheng, the head of the Russian staff of the British-owned China General Omnibus Company, departed from Jing'an Temple in a company truck at 10:00 pm on Wednesday (the 25th). When the truck reached a dimly lit section of Connaught Road, several workers suddenly threw stones from the roadside, like rain. The truck's windows were also smashed. Upon seeing this, Eisheng jumped out of the truck and went to the roadside to disperse the workers. The workers fled into the darkness. Eisheng pursued them but did not catch any of them. When he returned to where the truck was parked, for some unknown reason, the truck had already driven away. Thus, Eisheng had no choice but to walk home, and since then, he has disappeared without a trace.</p>

<p>Since the International Business Corps temporarily took over the defense of the northern part of Zone B of the Public Concession, it has been more than a month. According to information obtained by a reporter from the Pinyin News Agency yesterday from relevant sources, last night at 6:00 pm, the International Business Corps made a defense adjustment. From the 19th of this month to yesterday, the defense of the area was the responsibility of the A Battalion. However, starting from 6:00 pm yesterday, the Business Corps Headquarters ordered the light cavalry and armored vehicle squadrons to take over so that the members of the A Battalion could rest.

<h3 id="e44">Several Chinese Directors and Committee Members of the Municipal Council Have Received Threatening Letters, The Letters Even Set a Deadline to Reconsider Their Attitude and Request Resignation from the Taxpayers' Association <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>The *North China Daily News* reported that, according to reliable sources, several Chinese directors and Chinese committee members of the Municipal Council have repeatedly received threatening letters demanding their resignation. The letters were distributed by the "Committee for the Rectification of Chinese Taxpayers" located in Hongkou. It is heard that the Chinese directors of the Municipal Council recently</p>
<p>received a threatening letter</p>
<p>on September 19th. The letter only gave them five days to reconsider their attitude. However, the recipients have not suffered any harm. The threatening letters demand that the Chinese directors resign to the Chinese Taxpayers' Association that elected them, and not submit their resignations to the Municipal Council. Their</p>
<p>stated reason</p>
<p>is that "the Chinese directors of the Municipal Council were elected in the past, and there have been no elections since then. The Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the Public Concession is clearly complying with the wartime order issued by Chongqing prohibiting elections for public organizations." It is also heard that Chinese director Jiang Yiping has left Shanghai due to political threats and is currently in this city. Only four Chinese directors remain.</p>

<p>The *Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury* reported that the kidnapping of banker Xu Jianping remains shrouded in mystery, as the authorities have not been able to obtain detailed information about the case. However, it is learned that Xu had just arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong and planned to send his children to the American School in this city. He had already booked tickets on the President Polk, scheduled to return to Hong Kong this morning (the 27th), but was unexpectedly kidnapped. It is known that Xu previously worked for the central government, assisting Finance Minister Kong. After 1937, he retired to Hong Kong and was not very active, but he often came to Shanghai. Some of his relatives have joined certain factions, so the news is unconfirmed. The truth about Xu's kidnapping is difficult to ascertain.</p>

<p>Chai Baodi, a local, 23 years old, lives on the second floor of 74 Chengdu Road. Yesterday afternoon around 3:00 pm, the second landlord, surnamed Zhang, wanted to take back the house from Chai Baodi, which led to a quarrel and then a conflict.

Chai was injured, fell to the ground, and was taken to the hospital by ambulance for treatment. His injuries were quite severe and life-threatening, as reported by the hospital. The hospital dispatched detectives to arrest the second landlord, surnamed Zhang, and detain him in the police station for further investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e47">Three Kidnappings Occurred in the Western District of the Public Concession Yesterday, Two Primary and Middle School Students Kidnapped on the Way, Iron Factory Manager and Car Vanish <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>Recently, due to the strict defense of the Concession authorities, banditry has subsided slightly. Unexpectedly, in recent days, as the police authorities have been paying attention to the occurrence of labor unrest, bandits have taken the opportunity to run rampant again. Yesterday alone, three kidnapping cases occurred in succession. The details of the three cases are recorded below:</p>
<p>St. John's Student</p>
<p>Chen Chongzheng, a second-year high school student at St. John's University on Jessfield Road in western Shanghai, is 18 years old and lives at 30, Lane 849, Seymour Road. He usually goes to and from school in a chauffeured car provided by his father. Yesterday morning around 7:00 am, Chen was riding in his family's chauffeured car, number 7854, to school. Around 7:45 am, when the car was near the entrance of the YMCA east of the school, seven kidnappers suddenly appeared. Two of the kidnappers, holding box-shaped pistols, stopped the car. The driver, Tang Shenghe (31 years old) from Jiangbei, was about to ask what was going on when one of the kidnappers aimed a gun at him, threatening him not to make a sound. The kidnappers dragged Chen out of the car and fled east into the alley, disappearing without a trace. The driver returned to the Chen family and reported the situation to the police station, requesting an investigation. It is heard that Chen's father, named Ying, is an ordinary businessman who works in the import and export department of the Jardine Matheson trading company on Jiangxi Road. His family is not wealthy.</p>
<p>Iron Factory Manager</p>
<p>Ying Jipin, the manager of the New China Iron Factory at 60, Lane 895, Xiaoshadu Road, is 41 years old and resides at 32, Zhenqing Lane, Xinchang Road. He owns a small car, number 412, for transportation. Yesterday morning at 9:45 am, Ying was taking his family's car to the factory, driving himself. Unexpectedly, when the car reached the entrance of the lane to the factory on Xiaoshadu Road, three kidnappers suddenly jumped out from the roadside, each holding a handgun. They jumped into the car, and one of the kidnappers drove it quickly towards Binlang Road. At that time, an apprentice at the factory happened to see it and reported it to the factory, which reported it to the police station. Ying's car had not been found as of late evening.</p>
<p>Child Surnamed Shen</p>
<p>Shen Jicang, a child from Changzhou, is 11 years old and lives at 53, Lane 1285, Avenue Joffre in the French Concession. His father, named Jiuru, owns the Tongcheng Silk Factory at 857 Xiaoshadu Road. Jicang studies at the primary school department of the McTyeire School for Girls on Yidingpan Road in western Shanghai. Because it is far from home, he usually rides in a chauffeured car, number 11084, to and from school. Yesterday evening around 5:00 pm, Shen finished his classes and was returning home in the car. When the car was driving to the intersection of Yidingpan Road and Kainalu Road, three kidnappers suddenly jumped out from the roadside, all holding guns, blocked the road, forcibly dragged the child out of the car, and put him in a getaway car parked by the roadside, number 17960, and drove west at high speed, disappearing without a trace. More than an hour later, the car was found at the intersection of Rue Robert and Jiaozhou Road. Afterwards, Shen's driver hurriedly returned to the residence and reported the kidnapping, and the Jing'an Temple police station was notified to investigate.</p>
<p>Car Found</p>
<p>It is learned that the kidnappers' car, number 17960, belongs to the Dakang Automobile Company at 487 Route de Messimy. According to the company, around 3:00 pm, two customers suddenly came to rent a car. Both were wearing Chinese-style clothing. One was a fat, bald man, and the other was tall and slender. They paid the car rental fee and ordered the driver, Zhou Liangzhen, to drive. When the car arrived at the Caojiadu Wujiaochang shantytown, the two passengers pulled out handguns, threatened the driver, and forced him out of the car. Zhou had no choice but to report it to the Putuo Road police station. Later, the car was found by the Jing'an Temple police station on Jiaozhou Road around 6:00 pm. The company went to the police station to retrieve the car.</p>
<h3 id="e48">Counterfeiting Trademarks, Sentenced to Imprisonment and Fined <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>The "Indanthren" cloth managed by the German trading company De Fu Yanghang is affixed with trademark paper and coupons. Recently, the company discovered that someone was counterfeiting these trademark papers and affixing them to inferior cloth for mixed sales. One case was previously solved. Now, it has been discovered that someone is also manufacturing these counterfeit trademark coupons at 14 Rongshou Lane, Beihai Road, and 3 Xinde Lane, Xinlan Road. Therefore, the company's legal counsel, lawyer Cong Zuhu He Baiqian, reported it to the General Police Station, ordering detectives to search. Zhang Yingxian and Zhang Zhongying were arrested, and more than 14,000 counterfeit trademark papers, 5,000 counterfeit coupons, and 4 printing plates were seized. They were sent to the First Special Court, where the police station's lawyer, Ru Bao Yi, prosecuted them for the crime of counterfeiting trademarks under Article 253 of the Criminal Law. The trial has concluded, and yesterday morning, Judge Feng Shide delivered the verdict: Zhang Yingxian and Zhang Zhongying, with the common intention of deceiving others, forged registered trademarks. Each was sentenced to six months in prison and fined 3,000 yuan. The seized trademarks and printing plates were confiscated.</p>
<h3 id="e49">Wife Commits Adultery, Husband Sues for Cohabitation, Summons to the Opposite Party Not Delivered <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>Wang Derong, a native of Shaoxing, 43 years old, lives at 103 Balichiao Street. Recently, he hired lawyer Zhang Danping to file a petition with the Civil Court of the Second Special Court against his wife, Wang Luoling'e (30 years old, native of Shaoxing), requesting cohabitation. The petition stated that Wang and his wife had been married for twelve years and had three sons and one daughter. Their relationship was usually harmonious. In July of the 27th year [of the Republic], Wang listened to Wang Guisun's words and took Niu Yuying as a concubine. They signed a cohabitation contract at lawyer Mao Xianshen's office. Unexpectedly, Wang's wife was secretly committing adultery with Wang Guisun at that time. Wang did not realize this until August 1st of this year, when it was discovered that Wang's wife and Wang Guisun had opened room 201 of the Qinghe Hotel. The police station was reported and arrested them for questioning. Wang believed that since the truth had been exposed, a lawsuit in public court would tarnish the family's reputation, so he did not investigate further. Unexpectedly, Wang's wife successively took out property, and finally, on August 3rd, she took the children, three suitcases, jewelry, cash of 10,900 yuan, and various company stock certificates, and privately tore up four blank Shanghai Bank checks. She left and did not return. He originally intended to prosecute under the criminal law, requesting an order to return all the property taken away. However, considering that Wang and his wife are a married couple and have been married for many years and have several children, the oldest of whom is already ten years old, under the current circumstances, he still hopes that his wife will repent. Therefore, he requests that she fulfill the obligation of cohabitation as husband and wife. The court accepted the petition, and yesterday morning, Judge Shan Yu opened the civil court to summon both parties to the case for mediation. Because the address of the opposing party was unknown, the summons could not be delivered. The court ruled that the mediation was unsuccessful.</p>

<p>The US Navy Department has now approved a new type of special-purpose heavy-duty speedboat. These speedboats are manufactured by the Fixture Shipbuilding Company, each equipped with two specially designed Packard marine engines. The hull length is 50 to 60 feet, and the maximum speed can reach 50 miles per hour. It is expected that these speedboats will be used for domestic defense and port patrols. However, based on their load-bearing capacity, they seem capable of more important tasks. Each boat can carry several machine guns and several torpedoes. Their high speed and adaptability also have unparalleled value in attacking the enemy at sea. The motor is designed and manufactured by the Packard Motor Car Company. The engine has twelve cylinders, arranged in a Y-shape at a 60-degree angle. The compression ratio is higher than that of ordinary motors of this type. These motors are manufactured with extreme precision, so no gaskets are needed between the cylinder head and the motor seat. In addition, it is heard that various sizes of speedboats are now being equipped with the same type of motors.</p>

<p>(Hong Kong Dispatch) The new education regulations promulgated by the Hong Kong Director of Education have come into effect this semester. Despite requests from various parties, the Education Department authorities have decided to implement them according to the original plan. In recent days, inspectors have been dispatched to schools in Hong Kong and Kowloon to conduct inspections. Violations of the regulations are corrected or classes are suspended. Recently, Liang Shih-hua, an inspector from the Education Department, discovered that a certain classroom in a certain secondary school in Kowloon was not suitable for teaching. He ordered it to be relocated. Another newly established secondary school in Tsa Kok was found to be in complete conflict with the education regulations and was ordered to suspend classes, it is said.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a certain Chinese education expert, after inspecting various schools in Hong Kong, told reporters that education for overseas Chinese in Hong Kong is currently commercialized. In the past, some schools had empty classrooms, but now some have as many as seventy students, resulting in poor air quality and affecting students' health. Some classrooms are set up in dark places, requiring electric lights even during the day, which is harmful to students' eyes. Furthermore, classrooms are too close together, and some are separated by cloth curtains, causing noise and making it difficult for teachers to explain and students to listen. Classroom management is extremely difficult. Even if students succeed in their studies in this environment, their bodies may be too damaged to be of use. Therefore, he expressed his agreement with the implementation of the new regulations. As for children who lose their schooling as a result of the new regulations, he hopes that enthusiastic individuals will quickly devise ways to provide relief, he said.</p>

In the afternoon, the rate once strengthened to 3 shillings 5.625 pence and $5.46875, and some even said that US$5.50 had been traded. However, before the close, the Bank of Japan and others took advantage of the low prices to buy back some, and the rate recovered slightly. As a result, the closing rate was 3 shillings 5.3125 pence and $5.40625, which was 0.0625 pence lower for British exchange and 0.09375 higher for US exchange compared to the previous day, equivalent to an exchange rate of $3.67375.</p>

<h3 id="e74">Gold Market Declining Trend Expands: Approaching the 6,000 Yuan Mark <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's gold market spot price black market conditions, initially, the trend was weak, already showing a tendency to decline rather than rise. The reason for this was that most people were bearish. Unexpectedly, at noon, news spread again that the new Sino-U.S. loan of 25 million yuan was about to be successful. As a result, sellers became abundant. In the afternoon, the price once approached the 6,000 yuan mark. Although it recovered slightly later, it still fell by more than 100 yuan. The opening price was 6,190 yuan. Subsequently, due to the concerted selling by silver houses and gold houses, and because most retail investors were bearish, although spot gold houses initially absorbed the selling, the price was ultimately pushed down to 6,175 yuan twice. After securities firms absorbed the selling and retail investors suddenly switched to buying, the price rose to 6,200 yuan. However, the buying momentum did not last, and the price fell again. In addition, the above-mentioned news came, and the selling momentum expanded for a time. The price fell to 6,070 yuan before closing. In the afternoon, the exchange market strengthened, and the price plummeted to 6,020 yuan. Afterwards, short sellers covered their positions on the cheap, and the closing price rose to 6,068 yuan. As a result, the price still fell by 139 yuan. Trading was brisk throughout the day, with more than 5,000 taels traded. Jewelry gold prices were lower by 10 yuan, while customs gold prices remained flat.</p>
<p>Gold Dropped by 140 Yuan, Weakly</p>
<p>The market conditions were weak in the early morning, and the opening price was immediately reduced by 17 yuan. A silver house entered and bought 50 taels, for 6,190 yuan. Subsequently, due to selling by a silver house and a certain gold house, the price fell by another 15 yuan. A silver house released money to exchange for 30 taels of gold, for 6,170 yuan. Later, with the support of silver exchange businesses and spot gold houses, the price rose to 6,187 yuan. However, because silver houses resumed selling, and because retail investors were bearish at the time, most sold short, the price fell again to 6,175 yuan. Later, securities firms suddenly came to absorb the selling, and the market trend turned upward again. When the price returned to 6,190 yuan, retail investors suddenly changed their minds and competed to cover their short positions, and the price rose to 6,200 yuan. In addition, a certain silver house also came to release gold, and bearish news suddenly arose in the market. As a result, the selling momentum gradually expanded, and the price plummeted to 6,070 yuan. However, the closing price recovered slightly to 6,090 yuan. Transactions were also made at 6,100 yuan after the closing. In the afternoon, the opening price of gold houses was mutually traded at 10 taels for 6,080 yuan. Later, the price rose to 6,100 yuan. However, because the exchange market was reported to be easing, silver houses and securities firms successively sold off, and the price plunged to 6,020 yuan. Afterwards, short sellers took advantage of the low price to cover their positions, and securities firms and silver houses scrambled to buy, and the price rose to 6,080 yuan. In the end, because people's sentiments were still weak, there was no shortage of sellers at high prices, and a certain silver house sold short again. Therefore, the closing price was only 6,068 yuan. As a result, the price fell by 139 yuan compared to the previous day. The trading range was 180 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of spot gold houses' own brand gold was more than ten yuan higher than the spot gold price, and the buying price was reduced by thirty yuan. The current bidding gold price was more than fifty yuan lower than the posted gold price. There were few transactions.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Prices Also Lower by 10 Yuan</p>
<p>The exchange price of jewelry gold per tael initially remained unchanged. At 12:00 noon, it was lowered by 10 yuan. It is estimated that Datong Hang changed the hanging price to 620 yuan. The new Hang was similar to the previous price. The buying price was reduced by about 20 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e75">US Dollar Drops <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market was characterized by strong rumors that the new Sino-U.S. loan had been successfully established. The spot gold price ultimately fell by more than 100 yuan, and British and American pounds also fell by 3 yuan each. British gold notes were manipulated by someone, and the price rose as soon as it fell, ultimately rising by 1.3 yuan. US gold notes fell to 18.3 yuan in the afternoon, but ultimately closed at 18.4 yuan, down 0.32 yuan from the previous day. Hong Kong notes were slightly lower by 0.01 yuan. Japanese gold notes fell slightly by 0.01 yuan. The evening market was 1.52 yuan. Korean notes were evenly supplied and demanded, and the market price was flat. The evening market still stood at the original price of 1.18 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday's securities gray market rose sharply due to the success of the Sino-U.S. loan of 25 million yuan. The market price was already stable amidst abundant floating capital. The establishment of this new loan was undoubtedly a strong boost, and the upward trend was even more vigorous. It is feared that this rise will inevitably exceed the high price of September 10 and see a new high price. Yesterday morning, due to the efforts of various parties, the price gradually rose in the face of selling by Defu, Datong, Lianhe, and Xinfu at Yitai, Runde, and Tongkang. The noon closing price was better by two or three corners. In the afternoon, news suddenly came that the Sino-U.S. loan of 15 million US dollars had been established, and people's sentiments suddenly became excited. The buying sentiment in the market was even more enthusiastic. Yongda had the best appetite, and because most people were bearish on gold, the government bond market was even more enthusiastic. Yongsheng, Xinfu, Hongda, and No. 6 and others bought successively. Class C broke through 6 yuan and approached 7 yuan. Class B broke through 8 yuan. Class A broke through 5 yuan and rose rapidly. Although Lianhe and Defu sold off, and Renchang and Gongmao also cut and closed, the supply and demand were far apart. As a result, the price rebounded by six, seven corners to one yuan. The transaction volume was 1.56 million yuan. A brief table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock trading: 50 shares were traded on the stock exchange, priced at 25.75 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday's public utility stock market opened weakly. The general public was apprehensive about the ongoing public utility strike wave, fearing that it would expand further. After the price plummeted in the early morning, it briefly recovered due to the news that American aid to China loan was successful. The market conditions fluctuated up and down throughout the day, with no direction. Near the close, it is estimated that most of the over-accumulated long positions had been closed. The prices of Yinglian, Huadefeng, Yihuo and other stocks began to harden. The future trend depends entirely on the development of the strike in this port.</p>
<p>The London market for Chinese foreign debt and other items remained unchanged.</p>
<h3 id="e77">Food: Fresh Thin Rice Opens at 86 Yuan; Number One Foreign Rice Has No Market <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign rice market turned stable. Although general speculators were still trying to stir up trouble by taking advantage of the Vietnam issue, the source of foreign rice has not been interrupted, causing actual sellers to remain on the sidelines, and large players even emerged. However, general short sellers took the opportunity to cover their short positions, so there was both buying and selling, resulting in a fixed situation. No. 2 Saigon spot rice was still between 65.8 yuan and 65.2 yuan. No. 2 Siam rice was 64 yuan, 63.8 yuan. Xiao Jiao was 63.8 yuan, 63.5 yuan. Number One foreign rice still had no real market. Even Yinghua Si's No. 2 Saigon rice opened at the original price of 77 yuan for 75 tons. Currently, there are less than 4,000 bags of foreign rice, but traffic between Hong Kong and Vietnam has been cut off, and it is difficult to guarantee that speculative rice merchants will not stir up trouble today.</p>
<p>Thick and thin broken japonica rice arrivals are still scarce, resulting in a rare commodity. The price of Changbang Sukeng rose by another 2 yuan. The price of Sukeng from other regions was 80 yuan. The road for Qingjiao fresh thin rice was very busy, and the price opened at 86 yuan. Nangang's original packaged early rice was 82 yuan. Bulk rice was 80 yuan, 79 yuan. Special fresh rice was sold alongside original packaged rice at 82 yuan. Glutinous rice, both domestic and foreign, rose by one yuan due to the continued rise in the japonica rice market. Kaijin Li Temoto was 72 yuan. Changdan goods were 71 yuan, 70 yuan. The selling price of Hong Kong glutinous rice was still comparable to that of domestic goods. Japonica Tip new goods were scarce due to continuous rain. Because there was quite a bit of water stain on the goods that arrived, they needed to be sold off urgently. The selling price of japonica tips was relatively loose, and were the same as the previous盤. Zhuanqiao new japonica rice still opened at 77 yuan. Taicang and Jiading Yang Tip were 66.7 yuan, and Du Tip was 66.5 yuan, 66 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e78">Australian Flour Order Confirmed; Price is 16.8 Yuan; Return Festival Flour Has Already Fallen <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the factory price of flour remained fixed. It has been widely rumored that the large amount of foreign flour ordered by various foreign firms has been confirmed by telegram. It is estimated that Muji Street Hang has ordered more than 200,000 bags of Australian foreign flour from foreign firms, at a price of about 16.8 yuan per bag in national currency, which will be shipped to Shanghai between October and November. This is more than one yuan lower than the price of flour in the Shanghai market, so the rising trend of the flour market is suppressed. The market for goods returned to the festival has been quite affected. Yesterday, Lao Che Zhan sold 200 bags at a price of 17.5 yuan, Yangpao Tai at 18.5 yuan, and Shuangfeng at 18.23 yuan, all down by about half a yuan from the previous盘. According to reports, the current stock of foreign flour in Shanghai has already been re-exported in large quantities, and there is not much left. However, it is still far off before the newly ordered foreign flour arrives, and people's confidence is still strong. The supply of Laoche Fuxin brand current flour for export from Chinese factories is still limited. Each flour number's retail counter hung a "No Goods" sign. It is said that the factories have started to supply as much as possible from today, but it is not known whether this can be achieved.</p>
<p>Yesterday, wheat remained stable and quiet. The supply from inland is very scarce. Japanese factories have not lowered their prices to absorb the supply. Chinese factories have continued to order foreign wheat, and there are also stockpiles of newly arrived foreign wheat, so the demand is even less active. The total market transactions were only one or two thousand bags, and the selling price remained unchanged for the time being.</p>

<p>The yarn market, which rose sharply the day before, rose sharply and fell quickly today. This situation is entirely due to the inconsistent operations of speculators. Therefore, the market盘 fluctuates constantly. In fact, many rumors have already passed, and they are all unfounded and not credible. Therefore, some large players, seeing that the Hong Kong gang's appetite has been satiated and purchases have turned quiet, and that the price has risen by 140 or 150 yuan in the past three days, took advantage of everyone's bullish sentiment to sell off large quantities at high prices. Once the筹码 eased, it presented a lightning-like decline. It is not敢下 what the future holds, because various forces are still strong.</p>
<p>Spot yarn opened in the morning with very enthusiastic sentiment. Everyone shouted to buy, but not to sell. The price of 20-count Shuang Ma was 1,118 yuan, jumping 20 yuan. However, buyers still flocked in, and sellers were not abundant. The price rose again to 1,120 yuan. At this time, large players successively sold off, and the amount was huge. General浮户 and抢帽子 quickly absorbed the supply. Later, long positions were still released. At the same time, the gold price fell, and the rumors were bearish. The market price fell again and again, falling to 1,074 yuan. However, the shouting to buy rose again on the table, and the price rose again to 1,085 yuan. Finally, because the time had come for 浮多, and the general trend was not good, they only closed out positions, and continued to weaken to 1,075 yuan at the close. The statistics for the half-day transactions totaled 4,050 bags. The price of 20-count Shuang Ma fell by 15 yuan. Today, 190 pieces of cotton yarn were transported to Yantai, and 1,575 pieces were transported to Hong Kong. The amount purchased by each gang is listed below.</p>
<h3 id="e80">Cotton Yarn Declines, Cotton Market Stays Ordinary <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>The current cotton situation remains ordinary. Because the cotton yarn market has turned downwards, people's hearts are somewhat mediocre. In addition, foreign exchange has been extended, and the needs of all parties have seen shrinkage. Furthermore, 300 bales of cotton were shipped to Hong Kong today.</p>
<p>In other news, the foreign cotton market price, especially in the New York cotton market, has been unusually active recently. Yesterday, it rose again due to purchases by the industry. It is generally hoped that the government's cotton pledge will be realized. As a result, the closing price was five to six points higher than the previous day. Indian cotton, including peak speculation, also rose by more than one rupee.</p>
<p>Shanghai foreign cotton transactions were relatively quiet yesterday. However, factories still have an appetite for imports. Meanwhile, companies with no cotton in stock intend to wait for a good price to sell, so they are temporarily taking a wait-and-see attitude. Companies that do not have spot goods are quite interested in buying, resulting in a general lack of goods to purchase.</p>

<p>The sugar market trend was flat and soft yesterday. Refined white sugar eased slightly. The Taikoo Sugar Refinery offered 400-500 tons of Dutch raw red sugar for October shipment, priced at US$2.535. Another 400-500 tons of coarse-grained white sugar were offered at US$3.235. Both are C.I.F. examples. The guild quotation: Spot No. 24 coarse white sugar, new goods in local warehouses, were 80.5 yuan, up 0.2 yuan; foreign warehouses were 80.3 yuan; transit goods remained at 64 yuan.

<p>Annan white coal was once weak due to a surge in supply. After the news of the Japanese army landing in Vietnam was confirmed a few days ago, street customers scrambled to buy it, and merchants took the opportunity to raise prices. The market is extremely tight. Annan white coal, West-style lumps, were priced at 222 yuan per ton for warehouse receipts, small lumps were 218 yuan, and coal dust was 118 yuan, ex-warehouse, cash transactions.</p>

<p>Dried scallops have been arriving in small quantities recently. However, market stocks are still considered sufficient, but the demand from merchant groups is depressed, resulting in a balance. Currently, Zhoushan goods are selling for 145 yuan, and foreign mountain goods are selling for 110 yuan, with only sporadic transactions.</p>

<p>The domestic cloth market opened yesterday morning, continuing the upward trend of the previous day. Holders were reluctant to sell, fueling the momentum, and selling prices rose uniformly. However, actual sales were ordinary, and retail investors sold, and all prices eventually weakened again. The range of ups and downs in domestic cloth was relatively narrow, rising 0.25 to 0.5 yuan in the morning and falling back by 0.25 yuan in the afternoon. Over 300 pieces of various goods were traded on this street. Guangdong and Hong Kong merchants handled 300+ pieces of colored cloth and colored twill. Yantai merchants handled 100+ pieces of coarse cloth. Merchants from Subei, Nantong, Taixing and other places handled 200+ pieces of colored cloth, colored twill, and coarse cloth. Demand from Zhejiang and Fujian merchants was relatively weak. On the 27th, 900+ pieces of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong and 1700+ pieces were shipped to Yantai.</p>
<p>Eastern cloth rose initially and then fell, changing very quickly. The market opening in the morning was vigorous. 12-pound Longtou fine cloth rose to 34.75 yuan, but then the yarn price fell sharply, and large bulls dumped, falling in a straight line. The low in the aftermarket saw around 33.1 yuan. However, it turned firm again at the close, with a transaction price of 33.45 yuan. Four Gentlemen serge reached a peak of 1.0125 yuan, closing at 0.9675 yuan.</p>

<p>The oil market early yesterday morning. Raw soybean oil still went against the trend. Soybean oil was vigorously absorbed by the new Gantai company, reorganized by Dingtai, resulting in a shortage of circulating chips and panic. The opening price rose by 0.5 yuan. Raw oil was unstable due to high selling pressure. The first lot fell by 0.5 yuan. Afterwards, soybean oil rose without falling. There were widespread rumors of favorable news for raw oil, so speculators became active again, and prices rose steadily. Buyers in the market were rampant, no less than in the heyday of the exchange. As a result, although they all rose sharply by two yuan compared to the previous market, it is feared that this number will not be reached in such a chaotic situation. Therefore, the actual transaction volume is also difficult to count. Specifically, 300 pieces of Jiaozhou soybean oil were traded, priced at 74.5 to 76 yuan. 100 pieces of Yanqi soybean oil were traded at 76 to 76.5 yuan. 300 dan of Dalian pure oil were traded at 81.5 to 82 yuan. 1,500 dan of Dayou factory soybean oil were traded at 83.25 to 85 yuan. Old warehouse receipts were priced at 80.05 to 82 yuan.

<p>Exports of miscellaneous grains on the 27th were quite strong, totaling 350 bags of beans, 1,240 pieces of bean cake, 600 pieces of bean oil, 370 bags of sesame seeds, and 460 units of sesame oil, all shipped to Hong Kong.</p>

<h3 id="e86">It Is Society That Should Be Ashamed <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>— Zhao Meiqi</p>
<p>I am a middle school student who became a dancer because of the war. Isn't being a dancer very lowly? In fact, this lowliness is not innate. At the same time, after they solve their economic difficulties, they also have spiritual suffering. So I wrote this article to make society understand the true feelings of dancers and to hope that customers don't treat dancers as if they are not human!</p>
<p>A dancer is not made by a human. It is indeed a dehumanizing thing. But who is born a dancer? Taking myself as an example, I am a very common case. Three years ago, wasn't I a young lady? Although I can't say I lived in luxury, I didn't have to worry about food and clothing. Since coming to Shanghai after the war, I had hoped to find a safe haven. But where is safe in the world? A happy family with a mother and a sister gradually felt that living in Chang'an was not easy, and thus my unbearable fate unfolded, which was a natural occurrence!</p>
<p>I am a woman with excessive emotions and cannot talk about Hitler-style rationality. In fact, this is a very difficult thing, and of course it is also the most painful thing? Because I am a "person"! But I am afraid of being deceived because of excessive loyalty. I have contact with so many men, some of whom use the most money to buy my favor, and some who offer small courtesies to make me happy. Possibly, in this circle, there are very few who are sincere. Of course, I also need a lover, a sincere lover, because I still cannot reduce humanity by even a fraction! Spiritual distress arises, and it is impossible for me to distinguish the hearts of every customer. Even if I could, can you not perfunctorily treat people you don't like? Do you dare to dislike them? You always understand that being a dancer is not to find a lover. So you have to smile even if you don't want to smile, and you have to dance even if you don't want to dance. Anyway, no one treats dancers as human beings. Doing the most painful thing in the world against one's emotions is being a dancer. At the same time, is someone who is willing to spend money on me truly in love with me? Then does someone without money not have enough to love me? The young ones are slick, so are the old ones loyal? This kind of doubt often makes me feel empty when I am quiet, and I further experience the cruelty of life!</p>
<p>The happiest thing (which can only be considered a happy thing) is that I am not a "tangyuan dancer", so I can be very relaxed financially. I have a group of people who consider me welcome but don't actually like me who come to support me, and I know how to be frugal. I rarely wear silk clothes because cloth clothes do not make them stay away. Here, I hope that dancers can be more frugal, so that we can quickly leave the purpose of being a dancer for money, and we can also transcend ourselves!</p>
<p>The above words are based on my own personal situation and environment, but among the thousands of dancers in Shanghai, there must be many who are in the same situation as me. Are we afraid of society's ridicule? No, it is society that should be ashamed!</p>
<h3 id="e87">The Harm of Shamans <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>— Jun Xiang</p>
<p>Born in a feudal and superstitious society, shamans serve the ignorant people who believe in "karma." It is said that they began before the Zhou and Qin dynasties. At that time, female shamans were called "wu" and male shamans were called "xi," collectively known as "wuxia." They were only used for "pleasing the gods" and "recalling souls," and did not have any direct or significant harm to humans.</p>
<p>Later, the shamans' "pleasing the gods" work was given to monks and Taoists. After people died, they were thrown into coffins and disposed of, and shamans were no longer invited to "recall souls" (in ancient times, after a person died, a "soul-recalling" ceremony had to be performed. Only if the soul could not be "recalled" was it believed that the person was truly dead and could be buried with confidence). If a child had a minor illness, a family member would simply carry a lantern and shout "So-and-so, come back!" in the alley, and there was no need to consult a shaman.</p>
<p>According to this, shamans really had no work to do and could have become extinct on their own. However, the sad thing is that shamans still breed freely in a feudal and superstitious society. Not only is there no sign of them disappearing, but they are also working together to harm society, which cannot but make people extremely angry.</p>
<p>The most absurd and harmful thing is the shamans' so-called "catching ghosts to cure diseases." Naturally, shamans have no medical knowledge. When a patient comes to the door, after the shaman "draws ghostly symbols" for a while, they determine that the patient has encountered some "evil god" or an enemy from a previous life. An "evil god" must be subdued by a "righteous god," and an enemy should be resolved rather than aggravated. Therefore, the shaman invites a "righteous god" to possess themself, and after acting mysteriously for a while, it is considered that the "evil god" or similar things that are tormenting the patient have been caught. Then, they wrap a little incense ash (which they call "immortal pills") for the patient, considering the "great work" to be completed.</p>
<p>Incense ash cannot kill people, which is beyond doubt. However, there are many cases where a patient's illness is delayed by the shaman, and they do not seek a reliable doctor for treatment, leading to an incurable condition.</p>
<p>Recently, the gambling game of "flower clubs" has been popular in the "badlands" of western Shanghai. This vicious force has spread to every corner of the concessions. Therefore, many shamans have recently added a money-making job called "carrying the tube." "Carrying the tube" means that the shaman invites some "great immortal" to possess themself, causing the gamblers of the "flower club" to kneel on the ground and ask the "great immortal" to "bestow the tube." The "great immortal" shouts for a while and then picks up a pen to write a few nonsensical "poetic riddles," asking the gamblers to guess them. According to the information I have obtained from various "flower club" gamblers, even if they guess according to the "poetic riddle," nine out of ten times they still cannot get it right. However, the gamblers do not blame the "great immortal" for being ineffective, but only blame themselves for not guessing accurately, which really makes people want to laugh and cry at them.</p>
<p>In addition, shamans also have the business of "interrogating dreams." It is said that the shaman directly invites the soul of the deceased to possess themself and talk to the relatives of the deceased—this is naturally another money-making scam that is not valid in a new society.</p>
<p>Shamans are big liars, the main culprits who treat human lives as child's play, and promoters of the prevalence of "flower clubs." Their harm to society is indeed not shallow. However, directly stopping and eliminating shamans is really not the most fundamental solution. The most fundamental solution is to instill new education in this group of people who are superstitious about ghosts and gods, so that they can escape from the old feudal and superstitious society and move towards a new society. When the old feudal and superstitious society completely tends to perish, then those shamans who harm society will have no foothold and will perish even if they do not want to.</p>
<p>Hawthorne Detective Case</p>
<h3 id="e88">The Homecoming of the Dance Queen <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter 8: Two People Caught</p>
<p>It's funny to say, Hawthorne's pistol was also pressing against Zhao Boxiong's chest, so he was attacked from both sides, making it impossible for him to move. However, if he or I actually fired, the bullets would pass through Zhao Boxiong, and Hawthorne or I would definitely have to share the aftertaste. I can't help but admire Hawthorne's agility. He clearly had already noticed someone outside the door. When Zhao Boxiong was turning the doorknob outside, Hawthorne probably had already hidden behind the door. So, as soon as the door opened, he immediately controlled Zhao Boxiong, making it impossible for him to fire.</p>
<p>After Hawthorne finished laughing, he reached out with his left hand and quickly snatched the pistol from Zhao Boxiong's right hand. He said in a pleasant tone: "Mr. Zhao—ah, Mr. Sun, please come in." At the same time, he also put away his own pistol.</p>
<p>I felt that Zhao Boxiong did not accept Hawthorne's invitation and was still standing stiffly at the door, neither coming in nor going out. Fortunately, no one was entering or leaving this part of the room at this time, otherwise this situation would naturally cause unexpected disturbances. I put the muzzle of the gun against Zhao Boxiong's spine and pushed him forcefully inside, making it impossible for him not to move his steps. I also followed in, closing the door behind me. When I got inside, my pistol was still pressing against his back. This was entirely out of caution. Because I felt that Zhao Boxiong was much taller than me, and the width of his shoulders also seemed to exceed Hawthorne's. If we fought hand-to-hand, it would inevitably take us quite a bit of trouble for the two of us to subdue him. Hawthorne was examining the magazine of the seized pistol.</p>
<p>After a while, he nodded and said: "Exactly, there are still seven here. The bullet caliber is 0.45 mm. The two missing ones, one was used to shoot Wang Lilan, and the other was your tribute to me. Mr. Zhao, right? —Ah, you're called Mr. Sun today, maybe you'll be surnamed Li tomorrow, anyway, they're all aliases, so I'll just call you Mr. Zhao. Okay?"</p>
<p>I gradually moved the barrel of the gun to his waist in front of him. I saw the terrible eyes under Zhao Boxiong's thick eyebrows, emitting a murderous light that could kill, staring at Hawthorne's face. His lips were tightly closed, making his jaw even more square and wide. Like Yu Gantang before, he also adopted a silent attitude, but there was no fear in his expression.</p>

<p>The Trolley Strike Conversation</p>
<p>The atmosphere in the office has changed today. Except for the manager's son, no one went out to eat lunch. Several colleagues brought dry food, and the rest asked the tea boy to buy some snacks to fill their stomachs. Rain is naturally a major reason, but the impact of the trolley strike is also significant, right?</p>
<p>During the two-hour lunch break, "movies" and "romance" are always the topics of conversation, but today they all focused on the strike.</p>
<p>The typist, Xiao Li, spoke first: "It wasn't until today that I realized how comfortable it is to take a car. With a car, can't you go to 'the best restaurant' to eat?"</p>
<p>"Taking a rickshaw only costs one yuan, which is cheaper than gasoline."</p>
<p>Someone argued in the washroom. Xiao Li wanted to refute, but had no reason to argue, so he mumbled: "Eating a meal only costs two and a half yuan..."</p>
<p>The newly arrived trainee was finishing a bread in the corner, and he also chimed in.</p>
<p>"It's not a problem for me. I usually walk more often, and I'm even more casual about eating..." Saying this, he felt that a new employee shouldn't talk too much, so he rounded it off by saying, "But it's too hard!"</p>
<p>"But you also have an advantage!" The voice from the washroom came again, "Usually you get scolded for being late, but now you can blame the trolley strike for being late."</p>
<p>Hahaha... A burst of laughter made the trainee's face flush red.</p>
<p>The steady accountant came out to mediate the dispute:</p>
<p>"Don't joke around, we have to plan for ourselves. If the strike is extended, there will be more problems..."</p>
<p>"Yes, what you said makes sense," Xiao Li nodded, "However, according to today's news, the concession authorities are trying their best to find a solution. I think the negotiations between the two sides will eventually come closer."</p>
<p>The trainee chimed in again, "Actually, a strike is a lose-lose situation. Today's company will never be as stubborn as it used to be. Today's workers are more aware of the overall situation. If there are no side issues, I don't think it will be extended."</p>
<p>"Hopefully so, the daily transportation cost is really unbearable!"</p>
<p>The street runner just came in from outside, and he ended the conversation, because office hours had arrived.</p>

<h3 id="e90">Popular German Romance Films <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>— Hua Zhi</p>
<p>Nazi German films have always been known for their rigidity, but there are also many that are full of romance. Especially after this sweep of the European continent, the output of various film companies has increased greatly, and they are working day and night to rush to send them to various parts of the country and the occupied areas for screening. Therefore, the films currently being shown, in addition to the few remaining rigid films such as "Iron-Blooded Prime Minister" and "Great War of Poland," the style of all other films has followed Hollywood.</p>
<p>Romance films and the leading actresses are naturally closely related. Among the famous German actresses, there is Lida Barova, known as a purely Germanic-type actress. Her films include "The Venetian Singer," "Flames of War," etc. Her latest work is "Comforting the Motherland," which is themed on a French girl's passionate love for a German soldier. There is also Lola Heine, an actress who came from the stage. Her successful works include "Waltz Carnival" and "The Beggar Student." She can sing and dance, and is most admired by young men and women. Her new film is "Daughter of the Sea." In addition, there are Zila Linda and Joan Daco, both masters of romance films. The former was born in Sweden and is known as "Garbo II." Her starring films include "Temptation of the South," "Hometown," and "To the Ends of the Earth." The latter's films include "Honeymoon Trip," and the new film "The Queen's Heart" uses the love story of the British dynasty as its theme.</p>
<p>Other romance films in production include UFA's "Pure as Jade," Tila's "Wild Rose," and Bavaria Film Company's "Calling Phoenix for Mate," all of which are new films full of romance.</p>
<h3 id="e91">Model Star George Brent: Dislikes Dating, Naturally Lonely, No Bad Habits, Devoted to the Film Industry <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>— Xin Fang</p>
<p>George Brent, although he cannot yet be ranked among the top ten stars on the silver screen in Hollywood today, the excellence of his acting skills has been widely praised. George Brent's personality has several points that are different from ordinary movie stars: he does not like to be close to women, but prefers to live a lonely life. He has never been seen with a female companion at public banquets. Secondly, he does not like to have his name often disclosed in newspapers and magazines and does not like to show off. For these reasons, when news reporters want to interview him, they are always unable to get their wish.</p>
<p>A person with a unique personality often has a few unique things in his life. George Brent is no exception! Every night when he goes to bed, a little dog that he loves sleeps by his side, and the door of the bedroom is never unlocked. In addition, there is another rumor that when he was young, he heard various Irish ghost stories told by his nanny before going to sleep at night, so until now, he is most afraid of doing things or sleeping in the dark. Speaking of diet, he has no favorite food. If you want to be strict, then it is steak and Ham格's biscuits. He has a very exquisite villa outside the film city, but he himself only calls it a "cottage," which also makes people feel very strange.</p>
<p>In short, it is impossible to find a second person like George Brent in Hollywood who is so mysterious. But he has one special skill, which is unique in the film circle: he has no bad habits and knows how to devote himself to film work and seek progress. When he has free time, playing 拉梵亞林 and chess is his only pastime. He never cares about improper entertainment. Indeed, artists should have his spirit to succeed!</p>

<p>— Wei Wei</p>
<p>Since the re-opening stage has been performed by Wu Suqiu, Chi Shigong, etc., the reporter has visited three times. The impressions gained from the various roles are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Wu Suqiu has indeed made progress compared with her last visit to the South. Not only is her voice louder than before, but she can also try her best to understand the plot when acting, and pay attention to her body and expressions. Therefore, the plays she performs are quite touching. However, her stage steps imitate Xun too much and should be changed. Suqiu is extremely intelligent. If she can be guided by a famous teacher, she will definitely be the best among her peers in three to five years, and it will not be difficult to become the second Xue Yanqin.</p>
<p>Chi Shigong's technique is absolutely correct. Although his voice is not very loud, his singing and recitation are full of charm. Fortunately, he is not long out of school and can actually hide his youthful vigor, which is not easy. Many bearded students produced by Fu Liancheng follow Ma Lianliang, but Shigong has no Ma's component. Some say that his singing and recitation are close to Tan Fuying, but in fact Shigong learned from Yu Shuyan. In time, when his voice becomes more solid, this statement can be confirmed. Shigong's acting is not as good as his singing. I wonder what his martial arts skills are like? Since his debut, he has not shown off any of his military skills.</p>
<p>Chuan Dewei It is rare to find a versatile martial arts actor in recent times. Chuan Dewei has a good appearance, a good voice, and good skills. He is still a versatile figure. Dewei's plays, especially those with elaborate costumes and weapons, are better than short-fighting plays, and those with painted faces are better than those with pure faces. Some say that Dewei's art is based on Xiaolou, but it is better to say that he learned from Shang Heyu. Nowadays, most martial arts actors claim to be of the "Yang school," and very few perform plays in the style of the old Shang. Since Dewei's plays belong to the "Shang school," his skills are uniquely wonderful.</p>
<p>Guan Dexian is fat and his appearance is quite similar to the late bearded student Guo Zhongheng. His voice is very good, and his singing and recitation are not unpleasant. His acting is okay and he is a good supporting actor.</p>
<p>Zhang Diefen has a beautiful appearance, but unfortunately she is a little short, and she likes to swing her hands, which lacks stability. Her recitation does not distinguish between high and low tones, and has the drawback of being "one-sided," which is purely a joke.</p>
<p>In addition, there are Liu Surong, Li Debin, Jia Duocai and others. Because they are not in Shanghai for the first time, I will not repeat them.</p>

<p>Jia Duocai is an old actor in his fifties, and his performance of old women roles is unmatched. I have seen Duocai's performances the most and have always been very satisfied. His strength lies in his ability to vividly depict the appearance and tone of the characters he plays. An evil old woman is an evil old woman, a matchmaker is a matchmaker, a shrew is a shrew, and a vulgar woman is a vulgar woman. Each play has its own style, and his mastery of the roles is truly admirable. "The Washing Flower Creek's" Fish, "Nengren Temple's" Sai Xishi, "The Jade Bracelet's" Matchmaker Liu, "The Heavenly River Match's" Sister-in-law, "Peacock Flies Southeast's" Jiao's Mother, and "Visiting Relatives and Arguing's" Hu's Mother are all his signature roles.</p>
<p>Sun Shengwu is from Suzhou and grew up in Beijing, so he can speak authentic Beijing dialect. When he was in his teens, he joined Fu Liancheng and started studying old male roles, but later switched to clown roles. After graduating, he worked as a clown and was quite popular. Last year, he came south with Wu Suqiu, which was a good opportunity for him to establish himself and gain fame. After performing for two months, he received rave reviews and achieved both fame and fortune. Mr. Sun Lü'an, a well-known amateur clown actor, often said to me: "This kid Sun Shengwu is really blessed. It's his time to rise, and he just happened to meet you, his patron. If you hadn't brought him to Shanghai, who would have known that there was such a good talent in the rising ranks of clown actors?" Old Lü's words were half flattering me and half the truth.</p>
<p>"Gentle and refined, adaptable and resourceful," are Shengwu's strengths in playing embarrassing situations. Sometimes, he can even improvise very well. Once, Wu Suqiu scheduled "Sitting in the Tower to Kill Xi with a Live Capture," but no one declared they could play the role of Zhang Wenyuan (a common saying among opera performers, meaning they can't do it). As a result, Shengwu improvised the role, went on stage, and performed flawlessly, incredibly. If it had been anyone else, they would have fainted or made a big joke. He has a wide repertoire and can play any kind of civil clown role. He can do anything, and he does everything well. In the "Baolian Lantern" play, his role as the tutor has many clever lines that others cannot match.</p>

<p>— Yi Xing</p>
<p>The long-anticipated Guohua modern drama "The Wandering Songstress," is now officially filming after "Li Amao and the Zombies." The drama is written and directed by Wu Cun himself, based on the personalities of the actors and set against the backdrop of modern society. Therefore, each actor can freely develop their acting skills, mobilizing all outstanding talents. Such as Zhou Xuan as the songstress, Bai Yun as the musician, and Yun Guangzhao, Yuan Shaomei, Meng Na, Gong Jianong, Zhou Qi, Tao Shan, Qin Lian, etc. playing important roles, it is a satirical singing drama. The script has been revised three times, and there are as many as seven inserted songs, all sung by Zhou Xuan. Due to the fact that foreign film distributors have ordered copies, the filming will be completed before the end of October. Newcomer Murong Wan'er will also participate in the film.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Tianchan's "Eight Volumes of Huang Tianba" <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>— Lizhi</p>
<p>Na Xiehu was originally one of the Eight Great Na, and Tianchan's eight volumes of Huang Tianba happened to be scheduled here, which can be said to be an old play with a new interpretation.</p>
<p>The plot in the eight volumes is quite lively, with scenes such as the Lion Mountain Martial Arts Competition, the Women's Army Capturing Huang Tianba, Li Xiuzhen's Marriage Proposal, Hypothetical Filial Piety Hall, Xiehu's Assassination of Shi Gong, Dart Wounding Tianba, Zhu Guangzu Seeking Medicine, and Cleverly Provoking Li Yu. These climaxes in the drama provide the audience with a lot of excitement and laughter.</p>
<p>Tianchan's lineup was originally quite neat, and this time with the addition of Zhao Songqiao, a civil and military old male actor, it is naturally more colorful. Zhao plays the role of Xiehu, and his performance of the assassination of Shi Gong, standing on high boots and tumbling down from a tall building, is something that cannot be achieved without solid martial arts skills.</p>
<p>Chen Hefeng's Huang Tianba still maintains his consistent style; Yang Baotong plays Zhu Guangzu, and his every move can elicit laughter from the audience, which is indeed a considerable success. The rest of the actors are also able to fulfill their roles, no wonder the eight volumes have been consistently popular since the opening performance.</p>
<h3 id="e98">"Sea Hero" to be Performed Tonight <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>The "New Art Theatre's" first production, "Sea Hero Zheng Chenggong," will be performed tonight. Although amidst the strikes of trams and buses in the two concessions, the crowdedness of reserved seats is similar to the situation when "Ge Nenniang" was performed. Moreover, because it will only be performed for a week, the audience is afraid of missing it, and some are even booking seats for the matinee performance. Today's matinee is a dress rehearsal, and "New Art" has sent out invitations to invite members of the press and the film and theater industries to attend.</p>
