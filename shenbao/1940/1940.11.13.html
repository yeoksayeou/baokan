<p>社評</p>
<h3>蘇德談判的剖視</h3>
<p>關於蘇聯外長莫洛托夫氏前往柏林，本報已於昨日試加評述，意有未盡，請再研討。</p>
<p>這决蘇德兩國在柏林的集議。自是德義日三國同盟宣佈以來的第一件大事。三國盟的簽訂於九月二十七日，到現在四十多天；在這期間之內，蘇聯方面的種種值得我們注意者，的有三點：（一）由德義日方面一再傳稱蘇聯與三國間的關係，行將更加密切，可是此類消息，每决都由蘇聯命由塔斯社加以吾認。（二）英美與蘇聯間改進關係的談判，亦在進行之中，而允其值得注意的，是美國於加緊對日施以壓力的同時，曾以各種行動，表示對蘇的接近。（三）三國同盟後，蘇聯官方初期是完全沉默，繼則籠統地宣稱繼續保持其「中立」，最近則由加里寗演說，表示蘇聯無法再置身於世界糾紛之外。及至前日，始宣佈了莫洛托夫的訪問柏林。把上述三點綜合起來看，的確證明一方面是英美對蘇交涉的頓挫，另一面是德國對蘇聯外交的活躍。</p>
<p>推考演變的由來：第一，蘇德雙方俱有彼此表明具體見解的迫切需要。蓋四十多天以前，德義以三國盟的宣佈創造所謂歐洲「新秩序」的時候，特別在盟的條文裏訂明對蘇聯的關係，不因這一盟的而改變。很顯然，這是先行緩和蘇聯强烈反響的一種手段，其性質是掩護整個盟的，而並不是訂的的正面要旨所在。這在蘇聯方面來說，有了盟的的特別條款，自不必遽予反對，但須追問明白；所謂「新秩序」也者，其內容到底是什麼？其範圍到底包括些什麼？由大體說來，所謂歐洲『新秩序』的終極內容，當然是建立納粹法西斯的聯合歐洲覇權。消滅其他制度，宰制其他民族；這一根本企圖，當然也要應用到蘇聯身上，絕不會有例外。牠的地域範圍，當然是整個的歐洲，連孤懸海中的英輸三島，尚且不能除外，何况久爲德義所垂涎，蔚爲大油田及大穀倉的歐洲蘇聯領域。這兩點主要的內容，或從納粹與法西斯兩黨的信條上，或從德義兩國近年來的各種　示上，皆可以十二分明白地證明其必然。蘇聯對此　　　然看得透澈。但是蘇德之間，並不因此喪失其暫　妥　　餘地，亦即並沒有立刻敵對的必要。盡爲了國際政治和　英戰略的理由，德義勢必暫時把蘇聯放在自己「新秩序　的範圍之外：甚　連蘇聯認爲與其根本利益有關的一些地域，德義也勢必相當尊重蘇聯的意見，以換取蘇聯對「新秩序」暫不干涉的保證。正在柏林進行的蘇德談判中，大的以此爲其最主要的項目。</p>
<p>第二，巴爾幹形勢複雜而緊張，彼此有相的其間分寸的迫切需要。蓋到現在爲止，義希間的戰爭，已經爆發十多天；這在德義的本意，企圖逼使希臘不戰而屈，故戰况雖愈演愈烈，然規模並非極大。不料希臘抗戰之後，英國即予力援，顯見得今後的希臘絕不會自動屈服：而巴爾幹旣入混沌狀態之中，德義亦即不能無所顧忌而以全力赴戰。在義希尚未交戰時，德義心目中以爲這一帶已被彼等勢力控制了，彼等東下時所剩餘的問題，僅僅一個土耳其的態度。到了現在，却因希臘毅然抵抗而使這一帶形勢整個的成了莫大問題。倘若德義企圖進窺近東和非洲，其勢必須在這一帶大規模的用兵，先把一切澈底置於軍事佔領支配之下，始有打開局面的憑藉。可是事非簡單，談何容易；其間就有了三個問題：（一）防止巴爾幹同盟的復活。（二）東下計劃中土耳其的態度，（三）蘇聯的反響。而蘇聯顰笑尤爲其中最重要的癥結。這一點沒有確定之前，德義絕對不敢盲進。所以在這一决的德蘇談判，必以土耳其與巴爾幹各國取爲主要的對象，圖謀蘇聯與德義間的暫時妥協。</p>
<p>第三，是德義對英作戰中的經濟及資源問題，有仰仗蘇聯的迫切需要。蓋去年九月歐戰開始以來，蘇聯對德國的關係，實在不是嚴格的「中立」。牠曾經在資源及經濟上，一再基於政治理由，給德國以種種接濟。雖經英國幾决抗議，接濟還是接濟。戰事經歷年餘，德國在歐洲征服了許多國家，資源當然已經增加；可是閃電戰所消耗之巨大，有非征服壓榨所得挹注：德義爲了從事於未來的大戰起見，現在即不得不企求蘇聯予以更大接濟。誠以英國旣得美國全力爲之後盾，而德義如果得不到蘇聯大量接濟，則德義對於戰爭的前途，顯然必歸於無幸。這是德義不能無所徬徨焦慮的。試看莫洛托夫赴德所携隨員，幾乎盡是工商經濟方面各種專家；此行係德方所邀請，而莫氏一行的人選陣容若此，可見主人方面所求者是什麼？亦即他們這决所談者是什麼？</p>
<p>至於遠東問題，蘇聯態度是十二分的堅定與明確，除了德國完全接受蘇聯的意見外，蘇德之間，決不再有商討的餘地。關於太平洋問題，雖是國際問題中最車要的一環，但非蘇德兩國所能把握得住，亦蘇德談話所無法强使日本冒險接受的。</p>

<h3>虹口昨又起紛擾日軍官中兩彈　兇手係日兵事後已逃匿　案情內幕日方嚴守秘密</h3>
<p>昨日上午九時三十分、日憲兵軍曹一名、在虬江路海斯克路被其同隊士卒一名槍擊、但日軍當局對此事嚴守緘默、眾信此項襲擊係起於二人之口角、該行兇之士座是否在逃或已被擒、昨日尙未獲悉、蓋日海陸軍官員、對此事均諉稱不知也、此事發生於公共租界範圍以外、故警務處並不加以調查、據稱受傷之軍曹、已飛送日軍醫院、傷勢頗重、眾信行兇之士兵曾開放三槍、當昨日上午九時三十分、虹口處於擾攘混亂之狀態時、警務處及日當局、以為發生襲擊日軍高級軍官之事、故而封鎖橋樑、搜查行人、大為紛擾、及至發現日軍自起爭端、槍傷一軍曹、於是至上午十時後、戒備卽告鬆馳矣、</p>
<p>日方已知兇手為誰</p>

<p>軍人被刺發生九起</p>
<p>查九月廿九日以來、上海區日軍人遭狙擊者、是為第九次、當時詳情未能確悉、而日當局亦不披露被刺者究係何人、官方僅稱、刻正從事偵查、以期緝獲刺客至於行刺原因何在、則拒不披露、惟眾信該兩日人乃有所爭執、致肇此槍擊案、</p>
<p>案情如何絕對守秘</p>
<p>一般人又信兩日人均已酒醉、此點未能證實、日當局今晨對於被擊者究屬何人、及其傷勢如何、俱守秘密、此點可為遇刺者係要員之佐證、傳被刺者身中兩彈、現臥日方軍用醫院、傷勢沉重、說亦未能證實、</p>

<p>急待救濟</p>
<p>昨日據猶僑方面消息、如此困難情形一再延續、則救濟機關當向本埠猶商呼籲援助、因其有力量捐款救濟猶籍難民也、最近本埠俄國猶民、以一百萬元之高價、收購美麥令斯隊之俱樂部、由此可知猶民實為富有、萬餘難民、急需救濟、昨日外傳本埠歐洲猶民救濟機關之職員數人、因未能籌款、將於短期內辭職、內部當有重要調動、</p>

<p>金融述評</p>
<p>— 聖剴瓊</p>
<p>—十一月九日—（續十一日）　川康的經濟建設</p>
<p>從戰前與戰期中的經濟情形論，雖然戰時經濟建設已有極大的成就，但是仍難令人滿意，而在加强經濟作戰力量的觀點上說，川康經濟建設今後仍需要全民的力量去從事；第一，戰前中國國防工業爲數本少，政府雖然盡心計劃，盡力籌備，但多未能開工生產；今日中國國防工業如鋼鐵，穢械，電力，化學，以及採鑛諸部門，雖略有成就，並採國營民營兼程進行，同時生產，但距自給自足的目標尚遠，必須努力建樹起國防工業自力更生的廣大基礎。第二，戰前中國農村經濟正在由凋敝轉向複興的途徑中，不幸戰事發生，在這方面的努力遂多疏忽，而其所努力的又都偏於東南，西南西北，頗少建樹；今日川康兩省雖在戰時農業金融政策推動下，對於農業金融的融通，農田水利的興辦，農業合作的推進，農業技術的改良，允其是今年四行在四川的統一農貸辦法，農業經濟建設，不無進步，但尚限於局部，未能普及；允其是西康省，全國農貸總額中它所佔的比重不過是千份之三·三而已，必需努力在技術上在組織上作實效的調整，再配合金融上的力量，作實效的援助。</p>
<p>川康經濟建設在加强經濟作戰力量的今日，成立一個川康經濟建設委員會以為實際有效的推進底機構，卽如是具有重要性必然性，而如何「移游資於生產、化無用爲有用」（蔣委員長對川康經濟建設委員會閉幕詞），實在是今後川康經濟建設中資金上的重要問題。政府前爲興辦四川省經濟建設事業，在九月一日公布四川省興業公債條例，發行公債四千　完，固不足盡「移游資於生產，化無用爲有用」底能事。至於節約建國儲金所吸收的游資，當然亦不能全用於川康經濟建設。故組設川康興業公司，籌集資金，以為實際推動經建業務的機構，殊爲必要。但是當前籌集資金的方法要著重在移游資於生產、故以政府作爲主體的公債募集資金方法，實在不希望見之於川康經濟建設聲中。據可靠方面的估計，重慶有游資三萬萬元，上海方面有估計三十萬萬元的，有估計六十五萬萬元的，有估計爲五十萬萬元的，但上海的游資爲重慶的十倍以上，當無可疑。川康興業公司不但要能吸收重慶的游資，並目應集中精力來吸收上海的游資，移用於生產之途，省得在投機市塲滾進滾出，作不利於中國戰時經濟的行爲。</p>
<p>在平津環境惡劣開始的時候，因爲日人在金融方面的統制平津資金大量南下，滙合到上海來，致上海的游資擁塞不堪，雖經有識之士，大聲　呼資金內移，但因中國政府在上海尚力足以保護它的安全下，卒不聽勸吿從事於不利國家的投機。今日上海的環境如何，還不快些將可貴的資金，趁此川康經濟建設聲中，急急地移殖內地，以求資金的安全，防止未來的危險，上海的游資所有者，有識的金融業，有企業心的實業家，放遠目光，不要每一件事在目前的利害得失中計盈虧，權輕重，爭取主動的權能，不但將自己的資財移殖內地，並鼓勵他人亦將資財移殖內地，不但將自己在上海創業的心轉爲建設內地的心，並勸化他人在上海創業的心韓爲建設內地的心。則川康經濟建設的成　，不僅是川康兩省的成　，實乃是上海的游資所有者金融業實業家的成就。（完）</p>

<h3>生活苦痛與改造現實</h3>
<p>— 昱火</p>
<p>許是自己也正因爲處於聯業圈中的一個吧，因此，對於在這個商業社會裹的職業靑年的苦痛，—她的深刻的程度，自己正也是歷歷身臨，而所深切感覺到的。</p>
<p>普通說來，所謂這苦痛的來由，大致是因了「依人籬下」，「爲人作嫁」等的受人家的節制所起；其實像這麼充溢了封建氣息的古老的商業制度，固然也是促使一般職業靑年獲致苦痛的原因之一；但在今天，毋庸吾認地難經過了一個整日的辛勞，而結果却還是「衣無以溫，食無以飽」的這個普遍的矛盾的現象，是促使最多數的職業靑年們趣於苦悶消沉的最大的原因！</p>
<p>於是，有些正如本刊遂眞先生的朋友所訴說着的一般：把整個人生，看得淡然無味，意興頽唐，終於抵不過層層的壓力，便被社會排擠到牛角尖裏去了！</p>
<p>生活的牛角尖雖屬一路，但行進的方向，却儘是多角的！最脆弱的是頻求自殺以遂了却殘生之願：堅强一點而不甘自殺的，則偷，竊，拐，騙，盜，搶，便樣樣都可做得；但再也有些的，則是一如神經失常，昨日今日，一視同仁，意志麻本，態度消沉，「做一日和尚撞一日鐘」，抱得過且過，隨遇而安的生活哲學，目然他們一致的歸結，不是趨向立卽毀滅生命的一途，也便是在接近慢性毒害的路徑，這在我們是可以想見的。</p>
<p>願着這一個發展的風向，北影響於我們整個工商業的，甚至國家和民族的，老　是小堪設想了的！因此，在這裹我們除萬分希望着工商業的當局者們有以鑒　，而予聯業同仁們以生活上的同情的改善外，遂眞先生在本刊上寫着一個職業靑年的信上說：</p>
<p>「……在目前的環境下，不要過樂觀，不必太悲觀，手與腦，理智與情感，都同要時並用……」般的自作堅忍的奮鬥確是每個職業同伴所應奉爲圭臬的話。</p>
<p>但奮鬥不是盲目的一件事，對於本身環境的體認，允其對奮鬥目標的確定，應該是個首要的條件。</p>
<p>「你爲衣食所累，大部分自然是社會問題，但是你小部分還是在你自己……」這是遂眞先生在本刊上分析給他的朋友的所以爲衣食所累的究竟。我們不知道遂眞先生的朋友的實際是怎樣的，但一般地想起來和整個工商界同仁的處境是不會大二樣的，那麼似乎大家所蒙受着生活的壓迫，出乎本身的原因，可僅能佔其極微的部份，醫如關於個人的「忍苦耐勞」，穿不了長衫的時候當勞工，吃不來佳餚的時候食菜飯，……在一般工商界同仁講，是都能做到的。但生活的難題，畢竟不易解決，有的甚至僅求一飯的職位，而不可得；（其在生活上的飢餐忍凍的情狀，不言可知。）卽以我個人夾講，個人的凍餒或能勉强渡過，老父，老母，妻子弱弟之輩，便不暇顧及了。像這種確切的事實，在今天的工商界中，眞何止千萬呢？從現實生活的體認中，這一個社會制度的固執和不平，才是最主要的促使生活苦難的原因，我們覺得。</p>
<p>「打破現實，改造現實！」這應是工商同仁們的一致的呼聲！自然這種不滿於現實，而勇於改造的熱情，應算是我們靑年人的一份光榮，而也應企求於每個人所具有的。接着閃在前面的問題，就是如何進行改造現實的奮鬥？而更重要的，却是確定我們奮鬥的目標。</p>
<p>由於生活加予了一般工商同仁以沉重而久　的壓迫，多數的於是以解除本身苦痛爲　要，道是無可吾認的。但隨着不滿的慾望，滋長在生活的享受上時，多數人便又憧憬於風掣電飛的汽車，和高貴巍峨的洋房之類，於是才竭盡「奮鬥」，企求職務上的爬高，以冀達到「面團幽」的地步；野心再大一些的人們，或希望自已做官，甚至成功一個偉人，……</p>
<p>這裏我們對於他們的向上志趣，是不應加予厚非的；但是很要不得的地方，是在僅僅企求個人地位享受的提高上；以「利已主義」爲出發點，我們可能不以當前一般工商同仁的奮鬥目標爲然了！因爲我們覺得「小我」的發展，至多成爲下一代的工商同仁們的生活的主宰者而已，不只其於我們整個工商同仁的苦痛的解除上，絲毫無關！如果我們欲待檢視一下「改造現實」的結果，却僅在其「本身」，這是一種笑話！</p>
<p>讓我們審視當前的苦難，（不只工商同仁一端而已），體認環境的源泉，確定「不自私」的向上的目標，不消極，不盲動，堅苦地奮鬥吧，—知能上的奮鬥，業務上的奮鬥，……多方地來達到大家改造現實的鵠的。</p>
<p>霍桑探案</p>
<h3>舞后的歸宿</h3>
<p>— 程小青著</p>
<p>第十一章　趙柏雄的供詞</p>
<p>霍桑的手裏在玩弄一把書桌面上的截紙刀，他的眼光有意無　地　在這把小刀上，淡淡地說：「你要解釋什麼誤會？」</p>
<p>趙伯雄道：「霍先生，你不是認爲那王麗蘭是我打死的嗎？」霍桑的目光仍不離開他手中的那把尖頭骨柄的小刀。　那末，誤會的倒在你方面。我知道你有打死麗蘭的企圖和計劃，並且在行動上也已完全實施了你的計劃。不過眞正致麗蘭於死地的，欲不是你，是另有一個人。」</p>
<p>趙柏雄的身子突然間完全挺直了，他的稜角形的眼睛也張得很大，閉緊了嘴，把驚異的目光凝注着霍桑。霍桑用手指彈着那小刀的鋒尖，可可作聲，絕對不理會他。趙伯雄緩綫伸手到衣袋裏去，摸出一塊白巾來，輕輕抹着他的額角和面頰。這一抹竟造成了返老還童的異蹟。等到他將白巾拿下來時，巾上已沾染了不少　石色的顏色。他臉上的縐紋　時間已完全消滅。</p>
<p>趙伯輪道歉似地說：「霍先生，我眞慚愧得很。我起先對於你的估量，的確還嫌過低。現在我才明白，你真是了不起。你的腦子，眼力和勇敢，都足教人五體投地。」</p>
<p>霍桑又揮一揮手。「趙先生，別說廢話。現在請你把經過的事實仔紐壁說一遍，省得我用假定的方式給我的朋支解釋。我相信包朗先生聽你親口叙述，一定比我間接的說明更高興。」</p>
<p>趙伯雄回頭來向我瞧瞧，嘴脣上露出一、絲微笑，接着父點點頭。可是他還沒有開始請述他的故事以前，又發生了一個小小的岔子。施桂忽鬼鬼祟祟地走進辦公室來，走到霍桑旁邊，附着他的耳朶說了幾句。霍桑點點頭，說了一句：「不用等，你叫康年回廳裏去好了。」接着，他站起來，跟了施桂走到辦公室鬥口，讓施桂走出去後，隨手把門關上。他回到原座上時，向趙伯雄點點頭，暗示他開始叙述他的故事。</p>
<p>趙伯雄說道：「霍先生，你說的都對，我的確有處死王麗蘭的企圖和計劃，並且也這樣實行過。不過在我叙述以前，還有一個先決問題。霍先生，你司知道這女子的眞相怎樣？最近有什麼行動？」（一六四）</p>
<h3>關於吃「慈善飯」</h3>
<p>— 新夢</p>
<p>最近我們在報紙上面，看見一個辦義務敎育的機關，發生舞弊情事。這件案子，現在正由負責人清查中，眞相如何，還沒有知道，所以我們還不能下確切的批評。但無論其是否舞弊，已給予我們一個不很好的印象。</p>
<p>我們知道過往有許多人假借了慈善名義，募集捐款，而目的在從中漁利。使一般　待救濟的人，所得到的實益倒是很少的一部。尤其是上海，情形是那麼複雜，吃慈善飯的人很多，所謂僞慈善家之流，眞是使人痛恨。</p>
<p>就「八一三」之後說來，以慈善歛　或冒或名捐款的人不知已有過幾多。甚至在收容所裏辦事的職員，也有尅扣米糧，以及運用各種卑劣手段來飽私　的。</p>
<p>要知辦慈善事業的人，如果假名歛錢，或從中舞弊，其動機雖因爲自利，但影響所及，是相當重大。第一，不拘是舞弊是歛錢，他們所囊括的錢，結果使不知幾多苦人不　獲得福利。第二，將會使有錢的人雖想慷慨捐款，也將望而却。這樣不是將使慈善機關的募捐問題更加重困難嗎？</p>
<p>因此，我們　向一般僞慈善家以及在慈善機關服務　舞弊的人忠告：你們該捫心自問，借了慈善的名義，去剝奪苦人應享的福利，是否應當？是否還有良心？</p>

<h3>故都三大科班近事紀</h3>
<p>— 語初</p>
<p>富連成社創立垂　十餘載，原係吉林富商牛子厚出資聞辦，由葉春善中共事，名喜連成班。後由沈秀水接辦，遂改今名。社長一職，仍由葉春喜蟬聯，葉謝世後，由其長子龍章承乏，三子盛章襄助之。所聘敎師若蕭長華，蔡榮貴，雷喜福，郭春山，侯喜瑞，王連平輩，均係梨園中之有數人物。出科之學生，享盛名者，尤不勝其數，馬連良，于速泉，（卽小翠花）譚富英，李盛藻，葉盛蘭，毛世來，等，更其中之出類拔萃者也。其班次之排列，以「喜，字爲第一科，下爲「連」，「富」，「盛」，「世」，以七年爲第一科，今已排辛「元」字。「元」字輩中，僅一郭　汾最近曾隨馬連良南來，乃係觀摩性質，餘大部尚在坐科，已漸露頭角者，有武生黃兀慶，徐　珊，（蘭沅之子花衫劉元彤等。</p>
<p>中國戲校於民國十九年成立，原名北平戲曲音樂院，　焦水志長校務。二十四年改組，另聘金悔廬爲校長，校名亦於同時改稱爲中國高級戲曲職業學校。其組織頗稱完備，除敎授戲曲外，尚課以國，英算理化等應用課程，實爲一最台理想之戲校。關於戲曲方面之敎授，有王瑤卿，高慶奎，稈硯秋，吳富琴，及已故之九陣風等。學生來滬後大紅者，有宋德珠，趙金蓉，侯玉蘭。（吳素秋爲該校學生，後因故牛途離校，改拜小雲爲師。）其餘在平時常出演者，何老生王和霖，李和曾，花衫白玉薇，李玉茹，鄧德芹，武生傳德威，何德亮，文武老生王金璐，及武旦李金鴻等。班次分　德」，「和」，「金」「玉」，四科。其成立雖僅數年，由于成績斐然，人材輩出，已駸駸乎與富連成社有分庭抗禮之勢矣。</p>

<h3>關於拍攝「西廂片」底小貢獻　湘秋女史　讀者意見</h3>
<p>— 麟</p>
<p>我是一個整天在家庭裏，忙着雜務，一些兒也不得間空的人。再加上又在某女職校裏担了些敎課，所以成大地手忙脚亂。對於享樂的事，簡直是無暇過問的了。</p>
<p>可是前天看申報，偶然翻到「遊藝界」，讀了石公先生底「祝福文藝電影二文以後，說是：「近來銀臺上也有了較好的轉變」，便是　膩人的「民間故事」，而改爲「文藝片」的攝製。這就不免使人感到興奮！他又說，首先開攝的是「西廂記；還說：要把牠拍成歌片。」我因着他這兩個目標，就引起了以　的意見。</p>
<p>我想：「西廂」，本爲傳奇的體裁，卽由「詞曲」與「賓白」，相間成文的，　來將那一曲詞」，塡上一宮譜一，卽可吹唱。這就是目下　成絕響的　崑曲」了。</p>
<p>講到崑曲一，一方旣可「吹唱」，一面又能搬演。所以單看牠底　曲文　，雖微嫌深奧，似乎難於得到一般民衆底了解；可是一上舞臺，或銀　，也同樣可以使人於劇情方面，充分領會。並且還能由領略　劇情一，而煮會到一曲文」底大旨！是則未　不可「雅俗共賞。」</p>
<p>所以我以爲旣然」要把牠拍成歌片」，那麼　其早製「歌詞」，倒不妨就直接採用牠現成的「曲譜」！這樣旣可使觀衆一新耳目，文可藉以發揚我國固有的文藝。</p>
<p>論到材料方面，「西廂」種類，不下　數種，都可用來參考。餘外如「綴白裘」，「納書　」……等，或是有「白一無「譜一，或則有「譜」無白；一便於「演一，一便於「唱」。倘須譜」「白」兼備，則如：「集成一，「六也」，「遏雲閣」，以及「崑曲粹存」，「崑曲大全……等。惜其套數不全，僅錄數折，各不相同，但取來揣摩可耳。</p>
<p>講到曲白　指授，和「塲面」顧問，則除前在「大世界和「大千世界演唱之「仙霓社」外，尚　「大同樂會」，倒很可找他們去討論一下，或能獲得較多的幫助。</p>
<p>我因看了社會風尚所繫的「銀幕事業」，旣有「轉變」的傾向。故而興會所至，就草這篇文字來做個倡議。還望文壇賢哲，藝界名流，不吝指敎！</p>
<p>劇訊　名武旦閻世善，自今春出演史新以來，頗受滬人士之歡迎，由春至夏，蟬聯三月之久，於六月底方始停演，載得榮譽北歸，歷時僅五月，今又於秋末冬初，應黃金之聘，與葉盛章等一行，的今明日卽起程南下矣。</p>
<h3>何日君再來　—已成絕響</h3>
<p>抗建已入第叫年，而一般靑年男女　中仍流行　頹廢之歌曲　何日君再來一，意識歪曲，跡近靡廢之音，重慶中宣部有鑒於此，愛　昨日分函內　部及中央圖書審查會查照外，同時並通令各省市律查禁，從　一何日君　來一聲，將成饗矣。　按　曲在　滬　帶最爲流行。</p>
<p>（二）孫景璐</p>
<p>孫景璐，是一九四〇年度崛起於藝壇上的一位新人，現在她是中旅劇團的台柱，兼金星影　公司的基本演員　在話劇舞台上與銀幕上，已成爲最幸運　享名最盛的一個。</p>
<p>會在璇宮劇院看過她演「原野」一劇中的金子，她的舞台作風頗近於唐若靑，演技是那麼的洗鍊，而國語又是那麼的流利；她自幼生長於北平，國語的流利當然小是意外的事，但她的原籍却是上海，這恐怕知道的人很少。</p>
<p>漢口，這是孫景璐的第三故鄉，戰時的中旅劇團在漢口演戲時，她止在漢口的懿訓女　肄業，由於興趣的關係，她投效　加人了中旅的陣綫，中旅到香港時，她巳成爲主要演員之一，但不幸中旅的內部忽然發生了內訌，她和姜　等人同時脫離了，加入了歐陽予倩主特的中華藝術劇團，　這一個劇團爲時不久就解散，於是她流徙而來到她的第一故鄉——上海。</p>
<p>來滬以後，她繼續爲話劇運動勞力，最初是加入辣斐劇　演出，後來唐槐秋來滬，中旅劇團復活，她以唐槐秋的邀請，又重回中旅；因爲唐若靑難得登臺，於是她便被倚爲中放的唯一臺柱子。她從參加劇運到現在，僅有短短的三年時間，但她已償了她的初願，而成爲話劇舞臺上的成功者了。</p>
<p>金星攝製「秦淮世家」，孫景璐以客串的姿態在片中演出，飾阿金一角，在她不過是嘗試性質，但片成公映以後，因爲演技的精湛，大家一致推許她是成功了！金星當局正需要人村，也就很迅速地徵取了她的同意，簽訂了一年的合同。</p>
<p>現在，孫景璐還僅僅是一個十八歲的姑娘。</p>

<h3>Yenching University and Peking Union Medical College Will Not Be Closed</h3>
<p>Beijing, Local Chinese newspapers previously reported that Yenching University and Peking Union Medical College, run by , were about to close. Authorities at both schools have repeatedly denied these claims. Now, it is again reported that both schools are busy with winding down operations.

In the current situation, neither school intends to close nor has made any preparations for doing so. There have been absolutely no changes to the internal organization of either school. The foreigners associated with Yenching University who will be leaving Beijing are two female teachers and their families, who are simply going on scheduled leave to return home. Peking Union Medical College has the families of two staff members who will be leaving Beijing. There are no other personnel changes. Some circles here believe that the repeated rumors in the Chinese newspapers about the closure of the two schools are merely part of a broader campaign in North China, ongoing for over two years, to eliminate Western and allow for the American educational system.

<h3>Differences of Opinion Among French in Vietnam, Rumors of De Gaulle's Resignation Officially Denied</h3>
<p>Hong Kong, Since the Petain government succumbed to , opinions among the French in Vietnam have diverged into two factions. One faction supports General Catroux, opposes any concessions to Japan, and advocates alliance with Britain. Since Lieutenant General de Gaulle was appointed Governor-General of Vietnam, the pro-Vichy government faction seems to have gained the upper hand. However, this does not mean the collapse of Catroux's influence. Before the arrival of the Japanese economic delegation led by Matsuoka, Governor-General de Gaulle visited Saigon. Because of his close ties with Catroux and former Vietnamese Governor-General Chadroux, France in Saigon was pro-British and anti-Vichy. Vietnamese politics and economics have long been dominated by French Jewish capitalists, who cooperate with the United Kingdom and the United States and support General Catroux. However, since de Gaulle surrendered to Japan, they have fled to Saigon. The pro-Vichy faction is now staying in Hanoi, while the Saigon faction has close ties with the United Kingdom and the United States. De Gaulle's trip to Saigon was to appease the pro-Catroux faction in order to achieve a united front before the arrival of the Japanese economic delegation. The Saigon faction is still very influential. However, the Japanese hope to divide Vietnam into two parts, north and south. Hong Kong naval authorities have allowed the French gunboat "Argos," formerly stationed in Guangzhou, to return to Vietnam under the escort of a French destroyer. This shows that relations between Vietnam and the United Kingdom have not been severed. If Vietnam takes a tough stance toward Vichy, the gunboat must be stationed here. It is expected that Vietnamese Governor-General de Gaulle, in order to gain the support of the Saigon faction, will refuse Japan's unreasonable demands. Therefore, the Japanese economic delegation may encounter difficulties in the current talks. (International News Agency dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>Hanoi, Rumors that French Indochina Governor-General, Vice Admiral de Gaulle, has already resigned have been officially denied by responsible officials here, who say that all comments regarding this matter are unfounded. (Havas dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>Chongqing, According to a Kunming telegram in today's Ta Kung Pao, Japan has made a new demand to the Vietnamese authorities to send troops to land and be stationed in Saigon. Much attention is being paid to this news. It is rumored that there are currently anti-Japanese demonstrations in Saigon, and that Vietnamese Governor de Gaulle has resigned to the Vichy government due to the increasing influence of General Catroux. The Chinese community believes that Japan may try to seize Saigon and southern Vietnam in order to complete its occupation of Vietnam. Japanese troops recently withdrawn from China may attempt to land in Saigon. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>Hanoi, Today, the government has officially denied rumors of the resignation of Vietnamese Governor de Gaulle. (United Press dispatch, 12th)</p>

Two public meetings will be held to inform the public about the living conditions of women and children evacuated from Hong Kong to Australia. After the meetings, a committee will be formed to discuss the issue of the women and children returning to Hong Kong with the government.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Analysis of Soviet-German Negotiations</h3>
<p>Regarding Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's trip to Berlin, this newspaper offered preliminary comments yesterday. With thoughts not yet fully expressed, please consider the following further analysis.</p>
<p>This joint conference between the Soviet Union and  in Berlin is the first major event since the announcement of the Tripartite Pact between , Italy, and Japan. The Tripartite Pact was signed on September 27th, and in the forty-plus days since then, the following three points from the Soviet side are worth our attention: (1) The , Italian, and Japanese sides have repeatedly claimed that relations between the Soviet Union and the three countries will become closer, but such news has always been denied by the Soviet TASS news agency. (2) Negotiations to improve relations between Britain and the United States with the Soviet Union are also underway. It is noteworthy that the United States, while intensifying pressure on Japan, has taken various actions to show its approach to the Soviet Union. (3) After the Tripartite Pact, the Soviet official response was initially complete silence, followed by a general statement of continuing to maintain its "neutrality." Most recently, Kalinin's speech indicated that the Soviet Union can no longer remain aloof from world disputes. Finally, the announcement of Molotov's visit to Berlin was made the day before yesterday. Looking at the above three points together, it is clear that on one hand, Anglo-American negotiations with the Soviet Union have been frustrated, while on the other hand, 's diplomacy towards the Soviet Union has been active.</p>
<p>Examining the origins of this development: First, both the Soviet Union and  have an urgent need to express concrete views to each other. More than forty days ago, when  and Italy created the so-called "New Order" in Europe with the announcement of the Tripartite Pact, they specifically stipulated in the treaty that relations with the Soviet Union would not be altered by this pact. Clearly, this was a means of initially mitigating a strong Soviet response, its nature being to shield the entire pact and not the main purpose of the treaty itself. From the Soviet perspective, with the special clauses in the treaty, there was no need to rush to opposition, but there was a need to inquire about the meaning of the so-called "New Order." What exactly is its content? What exactly does its scope include? In general terms, the ultimate content of the so-called European "New Order" is of course the establishment of a unified European hegemony by Nazi Fascists, eliminating other systems and dominating other nations. This fundamental intention will certainly be applied to the Soviet Union; there can be no exceptions. Its geographical scope is, of course, the entirety of Europe. Even the British Isles, isolated in the sea, cannot be excluded, let alone the European Soviet territories, long coveted by  and Italy, rich in oil fields and granaries. These two main points, either from the creeds of the Nazi and Fascist parties or from the various demonstrations of  and Italy in recent years, can be proven with perfect clarity. The Soviet Union naturally sees this clearly. However, the Soviet Union and  do not lose the possibility of temporary compromise because of this, meaning there is no immediate need for hostility. Purely for reasons of international politics and  strategic reasons,  and Italy are bound to temporarily place the Soviet Union outside the scope of their "New Order." Indeed, even on some territories that the Soviet Union considers to be related to its fundamental interests,  and Italy are bound to respect the Soviet Union's opinion to some extent in exchange for the Soviet Union's guarantee of non-interference with the "New Order" for the time being. The Soviet-German negotiations currently underway in Berlin have this as their main objective.</p>
<p>Second, the situation in the Balkans is complex and tense, and both sides urgently need to weigh the dimensions between them. So far, the war between Italy and Greece has been going on for more than ten days. In the original intentions of  and Italy, they attempted to force Greece to surrender without fighting, so although the fighting is intensifying, the scale is not extremely large. Unexpectedly, after Greece resisted, Britain immediately provided strong support, indicating that Greece will never surrender voluntarily in the future. With the Balkans in a state of chaos,  and Italy cannot act without any concerns. When Italy and Greece had not yet engaged in combat,  and Italy thought that this area had already been controlled by their forces. The only remaining question for their southward advance was Turkey's attitude. Now, due to Greece's resolute resistance, the entire situation in this area has become a huge problem. If  and Italy attempt to advance into the Near East and Africa, they must use troops on a large scale in this area, placing everything completely under military occupation and control before they have a basis for opening the situation. However, things are not simple, and it is easier said than done. There are three questions in between: (1) Preventing the revival of the Balkan Alliance. (2) Turkey's attitude in the southward plan. (3) The Soviet Union's reaction. The Soviet Union's expression, whether frowning or smiling, is the most important crux of the matter. Before this point is determined,  and Italy absolutely dare not advance blindly. Therefore, the current Soviet-German negotiations must take Turkey and the Balkan countries as the main targets, seeking a temporary compromise between the Soviet Union and  and Italy.</p>
<p>Third,  and Italy urgently need to rely on the Soviet Union for economic and resource issues in their war against Britain. Since the start of the European War last September, the Soviet Union's relationship with  has not been strictly "neutral." It has repeatedly provided various assistance to  in terms of resources and economy based on political reasons. Despite several British protests, the assistance continued. The war has been going on for more than a year, and  has conquered many countries in Europe, so resources have certainly increased. However, the consumption of the blitzkrieg is enormous and cannot be offset by conquest and oppression.  and Italy must now seek greater assistance from the Soviet Union in order to engage in future major wars. Since Britain has gained the full support of the United States, and if  and Italy cannot obtain substantial assistance from the Soviet Union, the prospects for the war for  and Italy will clearly be bleak. This is why  and Italy cannot help but feel hesitant and anxious. Looking at the members accompanying Molotov on his trip to , almost all of them are various experts in industry, commerce, and economics. This trip was invited by the German side, and the lineup of Molotov's entourage is such, what can be seen that the host side is seeking? What are they talking about this time?</p>
<p>As for the Far East issue, the Soviet Union's attitude is perfectly firm and clear. Unless  fully accepts the Soviet Union's views, there will be no room for further discussion between the Soviet Union and . As for the Pacific issue, although it is the most important part of international issues, it is not something that the Soviet Union and  can grasp, nor is it something that the Soviet-German talks can force Japan to accept at the risk.</p>
<h3>Roosevelt Speaks Out Loudly: Fighting to Uphold Democracy. Addressing the Nation at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Arlington, He Praises the Historical Significance of America's Participation in the War. The Secretary of the Navy Declares the Determination to Respond to Threats with Action.</h3>
<p>Washington - President Roosevelt, on Armistice Day, spoke at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Arlington Cemetery, saying, in essence, that he does not believe the people of the world are willing to submit to a disguised form of ancient slavery, or to modern vassalage, or to new emperors, new dictators, or the rule of new oligarchies. People who luxuriate under their iron heel will eventually rise up in revolt. This speech was President Roosevelt's first public statement after his third election. He said that some Americans, after the decision for the Great War, made unpatriotic efforts to make the American people believe that the sacrifices made by America were completely wasted. This kind of behavior is a big mistake. It must be understood that in 1914, a part of the world did indeed have the intention of destroying democracy and replacing public reason with power. But this intention ultimately failed twenty-two years ago. Future historians will write truthfully that the Great War preserved the "new order of the era" for at least a generation. If the Axis powers had succeeded militarily in 1918 and subdued the Allied nations, the resistance of the democratic nations in 1940 would have been completely impossible. Therefore, America is quite worthy of being proud of its participation in the war to uphold democracy. Today, we recognize some facts in 1940 that were not present in 1918, namely the need to eliminate aggressive armed forces, break down obstacles in a more closely organized world, and restore honor in contracts and verbal promises. We recognize that the progress of democracy must be greatly improved to achieve this goal. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>Washington - President Roosevelt paid tribute yesterday, on European War Memorial Day, at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Arlington and delivered a speech, saying, "I do not believe that humanity's democratic century will diminish in our lifetime, and allow the world to re-experience a new ancient slave system, or be ruled by a new feudal system, a new emperor, a new dictator, or a new oligarchy." Roosevelt continued, "Since the beginning of human history, humans have thought they were building a 'new order'. However, in terms of world civilization, the real 'new order' in fifteen hundred years has been very few." President Roosevelt traced the origin of democratic policies back to 1776 to 1914. He said that during this period, mankind strived to replace the principle of "might is right" with democracy. The President continued, "Our attempt was defeated two years ago. You and I have personally experienced the European War, but today we see quite a few unpatriotic actions among our people, spreading everywhere, intending to make us believe that our previous sacrifices were completely wasted." The President continued, "However, a hundred years later, historians will be able to accurately assert that the World War did preserve the 'new order of the century' for at least a generation. Historians will say that if the Axis powers had won in 1918, the resistance of the democratic countries in 1940 would have been absolutely impossible. Therefore, America should feel proud of its responsibility in preserving democracy in that war." (United Press, 12th)</p>
<p>Bethesda - President Roosevelt gave a brief speech yesterday at the groundbreaking ceremony of the naval hospital, saying that if the work of building the hospital could be completed in three months, it might increase the speed of national defense. (United Press, 12th)</p>
<p>Columbia - Secretary of the Navy Knox gave a speech yesterday, saying that President Roosevelt's third election is a clear demonstration that the United States is not intimidated by totalitarian countries. Knox also urged the nation to support Roosevelt. It is said that the United States Navy is the best equipped, best trained, and most powerful in the world, but "to defend the country and prevent those who threaten our coasts from approaching", it is necessary to establish a strong air force for the navy. (United Press, 12th)</p>
<p>Columbia, South Carolina - Secretary of the Navy Knox gave an Armistice Day speech here yesterday, saying in essence that we will not respond to this threat with empty words, but only with action. The urgent task is not what official words we say, but what actions we take. Knox also mentioned the renewed exchange of views between Germany and the Soviet Union, saying that Germany's purpose is clearly to seek further cooperation with the Soviet Union to strengthen its hand.

<h3>The United States Closely Watches Japan's Military Movements. Nomura Appointed as Ambassador to the United States, Difficult to Improve US-Japan Relations in the Short Term.</h3>
<p>Washington - Well-informed sources here believe that the news of the Japanese army gathering in Hainan and Taiwan Island has sinister significance. Many believe that Japan will use this army to occupy Saigon and nearby bays. If so, Japan will obtain the only real naval base in Vietnam to threaten Singapore, Manila, and the Dutch East Indies, and the Japanese army can drive into Thailand from Saigon. According to rumors here, Japan is now assisted by German military advisors, and American officials are closely watching this situation. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - It was confirmed here today that former Foreign Minister Admiral Nomura has been appointed as the new Japanese Ambassador to Washington to succeed Horinouchi Kensuke. It is widely known that Admiral Nomura once refused to accept this position at the beginning of Horinouchi's recall to his country, and only recently accepted it. The one-eyed Nomura has served in various advisory, administrative, and diplomatic positions at home and abroad in the past forty years. He also served as the commander of the fleet during the Great War. Nomura is generally regarded as a friend of the United States. This decision to accept the new position holds great hope for adjusting US-Japan relations. Since the United States, dissatisfied with Japan's invasion of China, abolished the 1911 US-Japan Commercial Treaty, US-Japan relations have become increasingly tense. Nomura is now facing a difficult task, which is to maintain good relations with democratic countries so that Japan will not be drawn into the war. In 1932, Nomura was the commander of the fleet stationed in China. On that year, Japanese expatriates in Shanghai celebrated the Emperor's Birthday. Nomura stood on the reviewing stand when a Korean man threw a bomb hidden in a sandwich box onto the stand, blinding him in one eye with shrapnel. When the Japanese press interviewed Nomura, he said that he was "difficult to be competent" for this position and said that he was only a first-class student in the diplomatic world. Nomura's election as ambassador is generally regarded as a victory for those close to the Emperor and a setback for military officials who are inclined to totalitarian countries and seek a close relationship with the Rome-Berlin Axis. Admiral Nomura is the fifth army and navy personnel to enter the cabinet. His efforts to improve US-Japan relations have almost completely failed due to the continued Sino-Japanese War, and his efforts ended when the Abe cabinet stepped down. (United Press, 12th)</p>
<p>Matsukoa Didn't Plan to Visit America</p>
<p>Washington - The State Department today denied any plans for Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka Yosuke to visit the United States for a friendly visit, or discussions on the Japanese side. A State Department spokesman claimed yesterday that he could not comment on reports that Matsuoka Yosuke's visit to the United States was intended to improve US-Japan relations. He also said that he could not indicate the US attitude toward a Japanese goodwill delegation at this time. The spokesman declined to criticize US Ambassador to Tokyo Grew's visit to Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka Yosuke on Sunday for a two-hour meeting. Unofficial sources here believe that if Japan intends to seek to improve relations with the United States, such success will depend on Japan's abandonment of its aggressive attitude and the unequivocal demonstration of sincere respect for American interests in the Far East. Observers here believe that under the current circumstances, a goodwill delegation headed by Matsuoka Yosuke or other senior Japanese officials can hardly hope to achieve anything other than an analysis of the real differences between the United States and Japan. The United States will, in any case, insist that Japan should respect its treaty obligations in China. Furthermore, military observers here believe that even if the United States and Japan can reach an understanding, it will have little effect on the American military expansion plan, including the two-ocean navy. The ongoing American military expansion program is intended to give the United States a strong presence in the Pacific and protect American interests in the Atlantic. No matter how the situation changes in the next few years, the United States will continue to seek the completion of this goal. The signing of the military alliance between Japan and the Rome-Berlin Axis has exacerbated US-Japan relations. Some believe that the improvement of US-Japan relations can only be achieved based on the coordination of US and Japanese views on certain specific issues, and through Japan's recognition of the interests of Western countries in East Asia.

<p>The Japanese Emperor Appreciated Grew's Speech</p>
<p>Tokyo - US Ambassador to Japan Grew's speech at a banquet yesterday was highly appreciated by the Japanese Emperor. Some diplomats interpreted this move as the Japanese Emperor expressing his desire for international cooperation and friendship in front of government officials. According to the US Ambassador's congratulatory speech, it was delivered at a banquet celebrating the 2600th anniversary of the founding of Japan. At that time, the Emperor and Empress were both present. The speech read, "I sincerely wish your Majesty and the people prosperity, and hope that your country will continue to increase its contribution to human culture and happiness." It was also learned today that the US Ambassador and Foreign Minister Matsuoka also had a long conversation at the Tokyo General Assembly last night. (United Press, 12th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - According to reports today, the contents of the two-hour meeting between US Ambassador Grew and Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka Yosuke on Sunday were entirely to review the details of US-Japan relations. Well-informed sources report that the results of the review of current US-Japan issues indicate that US-Japan relations cannot be improved for the time being. (United Press, 12th)</p>
<h3>Japan Expands South Seas Trade Establishes Trade Promotion Association</h3>
<p>Tokyo - The Nikkan Kogyo Shimbun recently reported that the Chambers of Commerce in Tokyo, Osaka, and Nagoya have formed the "Japan South Seas Trade Promotion Association" to adapt to the southward policy. The association's headquarters are located in the Tokyo Chamber of Commerce and Industry Building. Its initial task is to send three groups of merchants to the Philippines, French Vietnam, and Thailand respectively to exhibit Japanese goods to attract customers. The association also has the right to implement various trade promotion plans and can send economic investigation teams to various parts of the South Seas at any time to investigate the market conditions of Japanese goods. At the same time, it invites business people from these places to visit Japan. In addition, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry also intends to send an investigation team to Borneo, Java, Sumatra, British Malaya, and Thailand in a short period of time. The planned investigation period is six months. (Havas, 11th)</p>

<h3>Nazi Party Members in Hungary Continue to Be Arrested Related to Plots of Coup</h3>
<p>Budapest - Hungary's resistance to the Nazis reached a peak yesterday. Two Nazi members of the Hungarian Parliament were arrested as soon as they left the Parliament building and taken to the police station. At the time of the arrest of these two Nazi members, a team of police officers patrolled with guns in front of the Parliament Square to prevent accidents involving the Nazi Green Shirts or threats to the Parliament. It is reported that these two Nazi members were accused by the Prosecutor General of conspiring to kidnap the Regent and the Minister of Interior, and requested the government to arrest them. The two arrested members are named Wirth and Kodreanu. The Prosecutor General also requested the arrest of three other members of Parliament, named Gere, Szija, and Lil.

<h3>Greek Forces Win Successive Battles, Italian Forces Retreat on a Large Scale, Abandoning Much Equipment and Supplies Along the Way, Corpses Litter the Mountains, Thousands of People Captured</h3>
<p>Athens - Unrelated war reports confirmed today that more than a thousand men of an Italian division were completely wiped out, and after another division was surrounded, the Greek forces continued to win great victories in the central region of the Greek-Albanian border. The Greek High Command announced today that the Italian forces had collapsed across the board last night. The High Command communique continued that thousands of Albanian troops abandoned the Italian forces and joined forces with the Greek army. The remnants of the Venice Division were completely unarmed during their retreat. The Greek army is now advancing again in the north to eliminate the remaining Italian troops defending Korçë. The retreat of the Italian forces on the western front was blocked by heavy rain. It is said that several teams of Italian mechanized units were trapped in muddy ground and are about to be captured. (International Telegraph, 12th)</p>
<p>Athens - According to reports from the middle section of the Albanian front, since one Italian division was defeated by the Greek army and another division was surrounded, important new victories for the Greek army have followed one after another. It is rumored that the Italian forces on all fronts are retreating. Albanian soldiers who escaped said that the Italian army suffered terrible losses. In a certain stream alone, there were more than a thousand Italian corpses. It is said that the recent victory of the Greek army was obtained in the area between the Gastroun Road and the Vougiouklon River. Greek sources say that the speed of the Italian retreat has made it necessary for the pursuing Greek army to obtain supplies from airplanes. It is said that after three hours of fierce attack by the Greek army, three Italian regiments collapsed, leaving behind all their weapons and other military raw materials. It is learned that the Italian army is planting mines on the roads in Albania to prevent the advance of the Greek army. It is rumored that an Italian column has been surrounded in the Pindus Mountains, but according to neutral sources, the Italian army is still continuing to advance on the eastern wing of the Epirus front. The Italian side sent a large infantry team to rescue "a column that has been lost" in the Pindus Mountains, but it was also surrounded by the Greek army. It is also reported that the Italian army trapped in the mountains is now being gradually wiped out by the fierce artillery fire and sharpshooters of the Greek army.

<p>Italian Isolated Forces Are Trapped in the Mountains, Their Advance and Retreat Are in an Unspeakable State of Embarrassment</p>
<p>Athens - The Italian troops, which have become isolated forces, implemented a retreat along the entire Epirus line yesterday and will reorganize a new offensive to capture Athens. The commander-in-chief of the new invading Greek army, General Soddu, suddenly withdrew his personnel and scattered them. The surrounded Italian troops are also fighting hard and trying to cross extremely rugged mountainous terrain to retreat to their bases, abandoning equipment along the way to reduce the burden, resulting in cliffs and ravines filled with weapons, ammunition, wireless telegraphs, field kitchens, and personal belongings. Italian reconnaissance planes are blindly trying to guide the Italian army in the valleys out of the mountains in the misty Pindus Mountains. The "isolated forces" are now being supplied with food and ammunition by supply planes dropping parachutes. According to Greek reconnaissance teams and total prisoner reports, this "isolated force" is composed of the entire Venice Division, a Julia Brigade, two battalions of Italian mountain rifle teams, and a battalion of the Black Arrow team. The vanguard of its previous offensive had already advanced to near its destination, Mezzovo, and was about to capture the area when it was bravely repelled by the Greek army.

<h3>Molotov Arrives in Berlin, Begins Talks with Hitler, German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop Also Present</h3>
<p>Berlin - Soviet Foreign Commissar Molotov arrived here at 11:03 this morning, disembarking at Anhalter Bahnhof. He was greeted by German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and his leading German officials, as well as the Chinese Ambassador to Germany, the Turkish Ambassador, the Japanese Ambassador, and the Italian Chargé d'affaires. The station platform was adorned with the national flags of Germany and the Soviet Union. Mr. Molotov, wearing a gray fur hat and a black cloak, stepped off the train and onto the platform. Amidst German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's brief welcome, he frequently shook hands, paid his respects, and responded. He then introduced his entourage to the German Foreign Minister, who in turn introduced the Chinese, Japanese, and Turkish Ambassadors, the Italian Chargé d'affaires, German Army Chief of Staff Jodl, Police Chief Himmler, Leader of the German Labour Front Ley, and other high-ranking German officials, who all shook hands with Mr. Molotov. The Counselor of the Soviet Embassy in Berlin also introduced Mr. Molotov's accompanying officials to the German officials and diplomats. After inspecting the honor guard in front of the station, Mr. Molotov and the German Foreign Minister returned to their car and drove to the "Grand Hotel," the German government's guest house, where Mr. Molotov will be staying. Dr. Meissner, representing Führer Hitler, extended a warm welcome. Mr. Molotov had already entered Germany last night, his special train arriving in East Prussia at 7:05 PM yesterday. Diplomatic circles believe that Mr. Molotov's visit signifies another important diplomatic activity by the German-Italian Axis affecting both Europe and Asia. (United Press, 12th)</p>
<p>Berlin - Hitler received Molotov at the Chancellery this afternoon to discuss various important issues. German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and Soviet Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Dekanozov participated in the discussions. (Haitong, 10th)</p>
<p>Berlin - After arriving here at 10:05 this morning, Molotov wasted no time. After a brief rest at his hotel, he went to the German Foreign Ministry at noon to confer with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop for an hour. However, the subject of their discussions was not announced. Official sources here stated that Molotov's visit to the German capital was to reciprocate German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's two visits to the Soviet Union last year. The German Foreign Minister's first trip to the Soviet Union was in August, and the result of those talks was the conclusion of the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact. His second trip was on September 28, which resulted in a joint German-Soviet warning to allied nations not to resist Germany, and the conclusion of the so-called "Treaty of Border Friendship" to partition conquered Poland. (United Press, 12th)</p>
<p>Berlin - Berlin officials announced last night that "Chairman of the Soviet Council of People's Commissars and Foreign Commissar Molotov, at the invitation of the German government, departed from Moscow for Berlin today and is scheduled to arrive in Berlin on November 12. German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop will be at the station to welcome him. On the night of the 11th, Mr. Molotov, accompanied by several important Soviet officials and German Ambassador Count von der Schulenburg, arrived in Malkinia, Germany, where they were welcomed by German government representatives, including the head of the Foreign Ministry's Protocol Department, Thunberg, the Liaison Officer of the Nazi Party and SA leader Stenka, and Navy Captain Stoffhaus." (Haitong, 12th)</p>
<p>London - A Reuters diplomatic correspondent reports that Soviet Foreign Commissar Molotov's visit to Berlin may not lead to any political developments, but the German side clearly wants to promote the possibility of some development. Molotov's entourage of thirty-two experts suggests the path that negotiations will follow. What can be discerned now is that Molotov will only stay in Berlin for two days before leaving his experts to discuss the details of any possible agreement. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>Berlin - The issues to be negotiated by Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov in Berlin are currently unknown. Well-informed sources here claim that new emerging countries will agree on methods to build a new order in Europe and Asia. Foreign newspapers widely report that Molotov will sign a new pact and meet with representatives from Italy and Japan, but this has not been heard here. Political figures in Berlin point out that both Germany and the Soviet Union understand that German-Soviet friendship benefits both countries, while German-Soviet hostility harms both countries. This understanding is the foundation of the German-Soviet agreement and the basis for these Berlin talks. It is claimed here that the German-Soviet talks may mention the German-Italian-Japanese pact, but this is not yet known. They point out that when the German-Soviet agreement was signed, relations between the Soviet Union and Italy, and the Soviet Union and Japan, had already changed, and that the German Foreign Minister mentioned the possibility of improving Soviet-Japanese relations during his visit to Moscow. The German Ambassador to Turkey, Franz von Papen, will return to his post in Ankara at the end of the week. Whether he will participate in the German-Soviet talks has not yet been announced here. People in Berlin believe that Molotov's visit proves that rumors of a British-Soviet understanding are untrue. Molotov has brought a large entourage, including various experts, and the program for his visit has not yet been announced. (Haitong, 12th)</p>
<p>Berlin - The German Foreign Ministry's mouthpiece, the "German Foreign Policy Correspondence," published an article this morning commenting on Soviet Foreign Commissar Molotov's visit to Berlin, stating that the significance and purpose of the German-Soviet agreement is to promote friendly relations between the two countries and to consider the interests vital to the survival of both countries. In fact, Germany and the Soviet Union have a full understanding and their relationship is becoming closer. This fundamental attitude extends to all important issues, and current conflicts do not affect German-Soviet relations. Both Germany and the Soviet Union are committed to building a prosperous society, so the nature of German-Soviet relations is constructive. Many of the important demands of both sides have been realized, and the world is now beginning to enter a new era of political development. (Haitong, 12th)</p>
<p>England and America Remain Silent, Watching Developments</p>
<p>Washington - Official circles here are maintaining a profound silence regarding Molotov's visit to Berlin, as its concrete developments may have a terrible impact on the relations between the United States and the Soviet Union and Japan. However, unofficial sources say that any Soviet-Japanese accord may seriously hinder cooperation between the United States and the Soviet Union in Chinese territorial waters. This is because past negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union have often encountered difficulties due to public opinion here finding it difficult to trust Soviet cooperation and holding an unfriendly attitude. Neutral sources believe that any practical understanding between the United States and the Soviet Union would also be met with strong opposition from the Catholic-influenced areas. Although Secretary of State Hull and Under Secretary of State Welles are still continuing negotiations with the Soviet Union, hoping to reach an unwritten agreement, in the American view, the goal is to cooperate in supporting China and suppressing Japan. (United Press, 12th)</p>
<p>Sweden - The Swedish correspondent in England reports that British officials are still taking a silent stance on Molotov's invitation to Germany. (United Press, 12th)</p>
<p>London - Today's editorial in The Times states that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's visit to Berlin is a bold attempt by Hitler to rescue his increasingly stagnant Nazi policies. Molotov's decision is in response to German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's sudden visit to Moscow fifteen months ago. It is currently useless to speculate what kind of inducement the German side used to bring this about. After Molotov's arrival, the German side may offer further inducements in order to obtain more active assistance. The main goal is undoubtedly on the supply front, in order to facilitate victory and enable the Nazis to dominate all of Europe. Molotov may well be a good listener, but this visit to Germany does not seem to be fully empowered to place his country's position in Eastern Europe and the Near East at the mercy of German policy.

<p>Soviet Union Determined to Maintain Neutrality Based on Its Own Strength</p>
<p>Moscow - "Pravda" comments that "It has been twenty years since the Red Army captured the Perekop Isthmus fortress. British and French interventionists placed their last hope on Duke Wrangel. They built a so-called impregnable fortress on the Crimean isthmus and received aid from the British and French navies. At that time, the British and French had advanced military experience and equipment, but the White Guards and British and French interventionists were ultimately defeated by the joint forces of Soviet workers and peasants. Although the era of intervention failed and became a thing of the past, the Red Army's "Perekop" spirit still exists, and there was the battle that broke through the Mannerheim Line. Currently, the Red Army has well-equipped and valiant infantry, countless armored vehicles, tanks, and a great air force. As for the common will of the Soviet people today, it is the same as twenty years ago: they are determined to defeat all enemies who dare to disrupt the peaceful work of socialism. Twenty years after the 'Perekop' battle, the Soviet Union has become a great nation, standing outside the world war and able to maintain neutrality based on its own strength. (TASS, 12th)</p>
<p>Rome and Tokyo Express Great Expectations</p>
<p>Rome - Although negotiations have not yet begun for Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's visit to Berlin, there has already been a very friendly response from both government and public circles in Italy. However, Italian newspapers have not yet published any comments, only reprinting German newspaper reports and their commentaries. Political figures solemnly point out that this is Molotov's first decision to travel abroad, and the Soviet Union has decided on its new policy. This is an unprecedented move in its history. Molotov's trip opens up new avenues for contact for the Soviet Union, and Britain's attempt to undermine relations between the Soviet Union and the Axis powers has failed. It is reported that the negotiations in Berlin will also mention Italy's direct interests, most importantly Turkey's attitude towards the war. Some believe that the issue of the Soviet Union's relations with the Tripartite Pact may be included in the negotiation process. Roman officials are keeping silent on this, but the general opinion is that although no Italian representatives will participate in the German-Soviet talks, there will inevitably be further political contacts afterwards. Rumors of contact between Italy and the Soviet Union, or between the Tripartite Pact countries and the Soviet Union, are also possible. As of today, this matter does not seem to be mature. (Haitong, 12th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - Japanese newspapers comment on the Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs' visit to Berlin as a great victory for Axis diplomacy and a warning to the United States. Newspapers discuss the impact of this visit on Soviet-Japanese relations, believing that close cooperation between the Soviet Union and the Axis powers will affect Japanese-Soviet relations. Newspapers are very satisfied with the failure of British and American pro-Soviet policies. (Haitong, 12th)</p>
<h3>German Newspaper Comments on Soviet-German Relations</h3>
<p>Berlin - A recent issue of the "Berlin-Rome-Tokyo" magazine contains an editorial entitled "Bridge to the East," stating that German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's visit to Moscow last year and the signing of the German-Soviet Friendship Pact formed the basis for the German-Soviet economic agreement. German-Soviet friendship has thus become a political reality. The British and French press claimed that this friendship was a "hollow shell," but the opposite has now been proven. Over the past year, Britain has repeatedly attempted to undermine German-Soviet relations, as this is the main objective of its foreign policy. From London's perspective, this policy is on par with gaining the friendship of the United States, but the British attempt has been met with a smile by both Germany and the Soviet Union. During this period, trade between the two countries has flourished, and the withdrawal of German troops from Soviet territory bordering former Poland and the return of German expatriates from Bessarabia have not caused any friction. The cooperation between the German and Soviet authorities is satisfactory in all respects, and the sphere of interest of each party has been clearly recognized by both sides. Thus, the situation of maintaining permanent peace between the two countries, as expressed by Bismarck, has been restored. The mutual trust between Germany and the Soviet Union is the guarantee of permanent friendship. There is no contradiction between the Tripartite Pact and German-Soviet friendship. Each pact guarantees the sphere of influence of the signatory countries, free from the influence of foreign forces, and its purpose is to maintain equilibrium. Since the Axis powers are friends with both Japan and the Soviet Union, Japan and the Soviet Union can also be friends with each other. The common enemy of Japan and the Soviet Union in Asia is Britain. In the past fifty years, Britain's position in Asia has been maintained purely by sowing discord between Japan and the Soviet Union. Today, a new balance of power must be established not only in Europe, but also in other parts of the world. In the future, the balance of power will not be the responsibility of one country, but must be participated in by the countries of that continent. In China, Japanese and Soviet economic interests are interrelated, and the complexity of the situation is comparable to that in Europe. Therefore, countries with interests in Europe and Asia must negotiate directly. The German-Soviet Friendship Pact and the Tripartite Pact were generally considered impossible, and the simultaneous existence of the two pacts was considered even more impossible, but today they are working together. What is being negotiated now will lead to even more unbelievable results. (Haitong, 12th)</p>

<h3>Romanian Earthquake - Ten Thousand Casualties - Iron Guard Carries Out Rescue Work - Oil Field Fires Cause Major Damage</h3>
<p>Sofia - According to recent reports from Bucharest, it is estimated that the earthquake in Romania caused a total of 10,000 casualties and heavy damage in at least ten large towns and cities. Fires have broken out in many villages and oil fields, and the military has been mobilized to fight the fires. Villantout, the epicenter of the earthquake, no longer exists. The Bucharest Radio Station continues to urge people to maintain order and not leave their towns and villages in order to help the authorities alleviate the disaster. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>Bucharest - The night watchman of the Carlton Apartments, during the earthquake, covered his head with a blanket and jumped from the tenth floor. Although seriously injured, he still reported the fire to the fire brigade. However, famous actress Grigoriyu Arapu and singer Apol were buried in the rubble. Because the oil stored in the basements had caught fire, rescue work was quite difficult. A death squad of ten members of the "Iron Guard," wearing fireproof suits and masks, entered the basements and rescued only a few people before perishing. General Antonescu expressed his gratitude in a public statement to the German soldiers and members of the "Iron Guard" who participated in the rescue work. According to official statistics, fifty-one bodies and thirty-two injured people have been excavated from the rubble of the Carlton Apartments. In other areas, nineteen people died and fifty-six were injured, and 183 houses are in danger of collapsing and will be dismantled after experts have decided on a plan. Another 402 houses were severely damaged. The newly built Ministry of Foreign Affairs was divided into two parts due to the collapse of the walls. Losses in the provinces are also significant. The Ministry of the Interior has issued an official report, and the Earthquake Research Institute is urging the public to remain calm and not believe rumors that the Villantout mountains will become volcanoes. Reports of trains derailing in various places have been proven false. The losses in the provinces are greatest in Barad, which has been completely destroyed. Houses that have not yet collapsed are also uninhabitable. The town caught fire on the afternoon of the 10th, and so far fifteen bodies and several seriously injured people have been found. Many houses have also collapsed in Jassay, and the art gallery has also been destroyed. Dyck's famous painting "Holy Family" has been destroyed, and four bodies and six seriously injured people have been excavated. In Galatz, forty-three people were killed, one hundred and twelve were seriously injured, and hundreds of houses were destroyed. The train station, railway factory, docks, and church were all destroyed. "Iron Guard" leader Simma has issued an order dispatching members to the earthquake-stricken areas to carry out rescue work. According to reports from Constanta, there was a storm along the Black Sea coast before the earthquake, which became even more severe when the earthquake struck. (Haitong, 12th)</p>
<p>Bucharest - According to Dr. Heinrich, a special correspondent for the Haitong News Agency, 80% of the houses in the Prahova oil field area collapsed due to the earthquake, and the power lines were also damaged. There was a spectacular sight of electrical discharges everywhere, but the oil wells were not damaged and, with the exception of the Rome Oil Mine, work could continue. The oil pipelines in Combina and other places have been repaired after being destroyed by the earthquake. (Haitong, 11th)</p>
<p>Bucharest - Romanian Minister of the Interior Petrescu read a preliminary report on the earthquake disaster at a cabinet meeting this morning, stating that the most serious areas of the earthquake were Bucharest, Prahova, Galati, and Poesani, followed by Măgurele, Căpușu, Mizil, Dărmănești, Râmnicu Sărat, Bala, Erdei, Găeşti, and Brăila. Piatra Neamț, Bacău, Kronstadt, Pitești, Craiova, and Constanța were also affected, but with the least intensity. A total of two hundred and sixty-seven people died and four hundred and forty-six were injured on the night of the 10th. Various emergency measures have now been taken, and doctors and technicians have been sent to the areas most affected by the disaster to carry out relief work. The cabinet then discussed burying the corpses and other matters related to post-disaster relief. (Haitong, 12th)</p>
<h3>Earthquake Felt in Moscow - House Walls Cracked</h3>
<p>Moscow - Nikolai V. Nikiforov, member of the Soviet Academy of Sciences and director of the Institute of Seismology, stated that the earthquake that occurred at 4:42 PM on November 10 was felt in Moscow and its surrounding areas. This earthquake was more intense than the one that occurred on October 22. Objects moved inside the houses and the walls cracked. The earthquake felt in Moscow was the reverberation of the earthquake that occurred in the Carpathian Mountains at 0:39:7 seconds on the 10th. The earthquake was felt in Moscow for two minutes and fifty seconds, and the seismic waves passed through Moscow for two hours. In addition, Kstovo and Nyebolchye also felt the earthquake. The Carpathian Mountains are the source of earthquakes, and six earthquakes have occurred there in the past eight months. Therefore, the Soviet government's decision to establish a seismological station in the mountains is very important. (TASS, 12th)</p>
<p>Moscow - An earthquake occurred here yesterday morning from 9:00 to 9:37, but it was not as severe as the previous day. The epicenter of the earthquake was more than 1,220 kilometers away. (Haitong, 11th)</p>
<h3>Garrison of French Equatorial Africa Surrenders to Free French Forces; Two French Warships Enter Libreville Port; Two Ministers of the Vichy Government Inspect North Africa</h3>
<p>London: A communique issued by the Free French Forces stated that the Free French Navy's ships, the "Brazza" and the "Commandant Dominé," had entered Libreville Port, the capital of Gabon in French Equatorial Africa. The area has since become a part of Free France. The commanding officer stationed in Libreville accepted the terms of the armistice and surrendered to the Free French commander on October 10th. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>Vichy: Official sources have received a telegram from General Tetu, the Deputy Governor-General of French Equatorial Africa, confirming that Lambaréné in the Gabon region of French Equatorial Africa has been occupied by troops led by the dismissed General de Larminat.

<p>Vichy: A telegram received here from Dakar, French West Africa, from the High Commissioner stated that telegraphic communication between Libreville in the Gabon region of Equatorial Africa and the outside world has been severed. The troops led by the rebel General de Larminat are engaged in fierce fighting with the garrison in the city. In addition, a telegram from General Tetu, the Deputy Governor-General of Equatorial Africa, stated that he had requested de Larminat's forces to allow non-combatants in the city to evacuate to avoid harming the innocent. However, de Larminat's response was, "You are completely surrounded. The key to stopping this senseless, murderous fighting lies with you. We are willing to cease fire until tomorrow, but we still hope you will surrender quickly to avoid further bloodshed." General Tetu, in addition to reporting the above negotiations, stated that as of the time of the telegram, both sides were engaged in close combat on the outskirts of the city. Furthermore, according to news from the port of Dakar, the port of Gentil in the Gabon region has not fallen and is still in the hands of the garrison. (Havas, 11th)</p>
<p>New York: According to news from here, rumors in Europe suggest that General Weygand has refused to return to France from North Africa. The New York Times reported that this is related to the occupation of Libreville, the capital of French Equatorial Africa, by General de Larminat's troops, the disturbances in Vietnam, and the resignation of Governor-General Decoux. According to news from Suleski, published in the New York Post, neutrals in the area believe that General Weygand's refusal to return to France is a harbinger of North African resistance to Vichy.

<h3>Armistice Day; British Air Force Triumphs; German-Italian Forces Launch Large-Scale Air Raid on London; British Communique Claims 26 Enemy Aircraft Shot Down</h3>
<p>London: The air raid on London last night was extremely short, unprecedented since the start of the air raids. According to a communique from the Air Ministry, there was a small-scale attack after dusk, which ceased at approximately 9:00 PM. As of 6:15 AM this morning, no enemy aircraft were detected over the British Isles. Yesterday afternoon and evening, only a few lone aircraft used cloud cover to drop bombs on areas such as London.

Most of the Italian planes crashed into the sea." The communique added, "Not a single Italian aircraft was able to drop bombs on British soil." Victorious British pilots said that the Italian aircraft were as easy to catch as "sitting ducks." (International News Service, 12th)</p>
<p>German War Report</p>
<p>Berlin: This afternoon's German war report stated that as a result of last night's German air raid on London, fires broke out in many places.

<h3>Braving Severe Weather, British Aircraft Counterattack; Long-Range Flights to German and Italian Territories; Fierce Attacks on Military Targets</h3>
<p>London: The Air Ministry released a communique last night stating that on Sunday, Royal Air Force bombers attacked targets ranging from the Baltic Sea to the Bay of Biscay on the Atlantic coast of France.

The targets attacked included oil refineries in Gelsenkirchen, Lorient, and Bremen; the Krupp factory in Essen; the Focke-Wulf factory and factories in Magdeburg; shipyards and ships in Kiel and Duisburg; and the ports of Lorient, Cherbourg, Le Havre, Dunkirk, and Flushing. Other targets included railway junctions in Danzig, Munster, Magdeburg, and Magdeburg; 14 airfields in German territory and occupied areas; Naples in Italy; the port from which Italian troops are launching their invasion of Greece; and Italian territories in Africa. Asmara in Eritrea was also attacked. On Sunday, British aircraft attacked the ports of Boulogne and Calais. Five British aircraft were lost.

<h3>Situation of British Forces in the Middle East Greatly Improved; Battles on Libyan Border Underway</h3>
<p>London: A statement released in London yesterday regarding the gradual improvement of the situation of British forces in the Middle East stated that the Italian army's attempt to cross the desert to attack Alexandria would be extremely difficult, if not impossible. Furthermore, the number and equipment of the British forces in the Middle East have been steadily increasing, and today they are a well-equipped and excellent force. The weakness of the Italian side lies in their lack of technical training, which is far behind the British army. The British forces are composed of well-trained troops from Australia, New Zealand, India, South Africa, Cyprus, Palestine, and Britain, as well as soldiers from France and Poland who have been through prolonged combat. The British position in the western desert has improved rapidly in recent months. War equipment and fortifications are now superior to what they were before, and the soldiers are accustomed to desert warfare. Even if the German army can be transferred to this front to assist the Italian army, it will still take some time to learn how to fight in the desert. To the best of our knowledge, there are no German troops in Libya at present, except for technical experts and advisors. The Italian army's current activities are mostly in the outposts. Not much material and gasoline has been transported into Libya; only stockpiled provisions. Now that the British have used Crete as a base, the difficulties they will encounter will be even greater in the future if the Italian side does not increase its forces in Libya. The British difficulty is not in manpower. Their troops have excellent morale, and new reinforcements from New Zealand, Australia, and Britain are constantly arriving. Therefore, the plan of the British staff is to maintain powerful armored equipment and aircraft to deliver heavy blows where the enemy can be severely damaged. According to the opinions of military experts in London, the Middle East war will be a laborious and arduous struggle in many ways. As for Gibraltar, its position has been greatly strengthened in the past few months. The military is working to strengthen its defenses, and they are now confident that they can resist any attack. There are two major points in the Middle East situation: (1) Britain must maintain Egypt at any cost because the Suez Canal and Alexandria are of strategic importance. If the enemy comes to invade, the British army will defeat them. This is the only way Britain can assist its allies. (2) Britain must do its best to support Greece and provide assistance as quickly as possible within its resources. Britain must choose a point to inflict a fatal blow on the enemy. The British army and air force in the Middle East have excellent communication, and the British air force is technically superior to the Italian. The Italian army in East Africa is now very worried about its positions in Abyssinia. This is because the Italian army launched a full-scale counterattack after the British seized Gallabat. Gallabat is the key to Abyssinia. This is why the Italian side used so many aircraft in its counterattack. Syria is not without difficulties. However, the British have repeatedly stated that they will not allow Syria to fall into enemy hands. As it stands, Syria seems to be stable under the existing government. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>London: Battles are currently underway in the Gazzala area on the Libyan border. The situation in Gallabat is quite confused. All that can be stated with certainty so far is that the area had been occupied by the British army. After a heavy bombing by the Italian forces, the British seemed to withdraw from the village and the fortress. The Italian forces did not re-enter until 24 hours later. According to a communique released yesterday, there were mentions of battles east of Gallabat. So, it is possible that the British army had reoccupied the outpost. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<h3>Egypt's Declaration of War on Italy; Egyptian Parliament Adjourned Yesterday; Decision Expected Soon</h3>
<p>Cairo: Egypt's attitude towards the need to declare war on Italy will likely become clear with the opening of Parliament on Tuesday. Since Italy's entry into the war, there have been two main factions in Egyptian thought. The Saadist Party, led by Maher, advocates for immediate declaration of war. The other faction, led by Prime Minister Hassan Sabry, believes that it is more advantageous for Egypt not to formally declare war. The leader of the Saadist Party, Maher, announced that he intends to raise the issue of the military situation in Parliament. Therefore, some major discussions are expected after the opening. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<h3>How the "Empress of Japan" Escaped Danger; Chinese Helmsman's Calmness in the Face of Danger Laudable</h3>
<p>London: News has been received that the British ship "Empress of Japan" was attacked by German aircraft. Fortunately, thanks to the calmness and courage of Captain Thomas and the Chinese helmsman, the ship escaped danger and entered port safely. The German aircraft's attack only damaged the boom and destroyed several lifeboats with machine-gun fire. A crew member described the captain's and helmsman's calmness, saying that the captain used his skillful maneuvers to steer the ship out of danger and avoid being hit by bombs, saving the lives of everyone on board. The Chinese helmsman was also courageous and admirable. He lay prone on the deck to avoid machine-gun fire while following the captain's orders without error. The ship's anti-aircraft guns fired back. One shell exploded under the enemy aircraft's wing. The aircraft was seen shaking and faltering, indicating that it had been hit. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<h3>Willkie Forms Opposition Party; Criticizes Shortcomings of the New Deal</h3>
<p>New York: Republican leader Wendell Willkie addressed 22 million of his voters on the radio last night, calling on them to support his organization of a loyal and constructive opposition party. The purpose is to assist the President-elect in all national defense issues, but to reserve the right to propose policies and criticize those implemented by the New Deal. Willkie went on to discuss the shortcomings of the New Deal, which are as follows: (1) Lack of economics, (2) Bureaucracy, (3) Corrupt political organization of administrative districts, (4) Government administrative departments seize the privileges of Congress, (5) Presidential overreach, (6) Domestic policies harm the nation's economic life.

<h3>Shanghai Marks the Third Anniversary of Its Fall Today; All Sectors Strengthen Resolution and Aspiration; Profound Remembrance of Tragic Past Events Inspires; National Father's Birthday Celebrated Vigorously Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the anniversary of the birth of the National Father. Coinciding with frequent victories reported from the front lines, all sectors of society, both Chinese and foreign, celebrated enthusiastically. The blue sky, white sun, and national emblem fluttered throughout the city all day, displaying an unwavering spirit of fortitude and perseverance. Government agencies, public organizations, and schools at all levels observed a holiday, commemorating this great occasion. All sectors practiced frugality, encouraged savings, and worked to solicit funds for winter clothing, indirectly promoting the early success of the national policy of resistance and reconstruction. To ensure security within the boundaries, the police department and the French Concession Volunteer Corps and the Shanghai Volunteer Corps were fully deployed to implement general martial law. As today also marks the third anniversary of the Western Shanghai Battle, this state of preparedness will continue for one day.</p>
<p>Never Forget This Day; National Army Moves West</p>
<p>Today marks the third anniversary of the fall of Greater Shanghai. The people of Shanghai cannot formally commemorate this sacred anniversary due to the special environment. However, they will not forget the tragic past. They are determined to commemorate the National Army's westward movement with a spirit of recuperation, learning lessons, and perseverance. They will observe a moment of silence, voluntarily abstain from meat, and cease entertainment and banquets to show that they have not forgotten. They will work hard, unite, support national policy, implement national obligations, and achieve the goals of resistance and reconstruction. To maintain public order, the concession authorities have decided to implement joint security measures for one day, dispatching patrol and search teams to inspect suspicious pedestrians and vehicles to ensure safety.</p>
<p>Savings Figures</p>
<p>The savings campaign has been vigorously promoted throughout the city, with full mobilization. According to an accountant at a certain bank, the total amount has approached 10 million yuan as of recently. It is expected that after yesterday's enthusiastic general mobilization, the number of subscriptions will be even more astonishing in the coming days. At the same time, the campaign to solicit funds for winter clothing is also being vigorously promoted. With only two weeks remaining until the deadline, the total is expected to surpass the target of one million yuan.</p>
<p>National Flags Fluttering</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, households and stores throughout the city hoisted flags one after another to commemorate the occasion enthusiastically. The blue sky, white sun, and national emblem fluttered everywhere, with clear weather and magnificent scenery. All organizations, schools, financial institutions, customs offices, post offices, trading markets, and most stores in the city took a day off. Diplomatic missions of various countries in Shanghai, various offices under the Shanghai Municipal Council, and the French Concession Public Works Bureau also closed, showing their respect. As a result, the streets were crowded with pedestrians, and the atmosphere was especially lively.</p>
<p>Support National Policy</p>
<p>At 11:00 AM yesterday, a large number of narrow printed materials, in denominations of three or five, were scattered from the sky between the Wing On and Sincere department stores on Nanjing Road. For a moment, passersby scrambled to pick them up and pass them around. The content was all about supporting national policy. Similar printed materials were also found on the streets on the eve of the anniversary. Yesterday, the walls of buildings along the streets in the central and western districts were covered with many foreign-language newspapers from Shanghai. Passersby gathered to watch. These were mostly done by enthusiastic individuals.</p>
<p>Scenes Outside the Boundary</p>
<p>In the areas outside the boundaries of the Western Shanghai Road Extension yesterday, Japanese troops, together with the "city police," also took precautions at various key locations. The barbed wire on Yuyuan Road and Jessfield Road still ran across the road. Pedestrians entering Jessfield Road from Yuyuan Road were still subjected to searches by the "city police." The Japanese also erected wooden frame barbed wire across North Jiangxi Road (the area where Nakamura was assassinated), from Jiangxi Road Bridge straight to Bazhi Road. At the two gaps at the Bazhi Road and Haining Road intersection, there were two Japanese soldiers on duty with guns. Another two Japanese soldiers were responsible for searching the Chinese people and residents entering the area. Outside the barbed wire, a team of Japanese soldiers patrolled back and forth on the eastern section of North Henan Road (north of Suzhou Creek).</p>
<h3>Customs Commissioner Luffred Reappointed After Term Expiration</h3>
<p>The term of the British Customs Commissioner Luffred of the Jianghai Customs will expire this month. A few months ago, Japanese newspapers had been continuously reporting on the impending expiration of the term of Customs Commissioner Luffred of the Jianghai Customs, with subtle criticisms revealed between the lines, hinting that they were eager for the position. A reporter from the Pingming News Agency specifically inquired about this matter from the Jianghai Customs authorities. According to reliable information, Luffred's term is indeed expiring. However, the Inspectorate General of Customs has consulted with Luffred himself and decided that Luffred will continue to serve as Customs Commissioner of the Jianghai Customs, leveraging his familiarity and experience. Furthermore, there is precedent for this arrangement among senior officials in the Customs Service, such as the current Customs Commissioner of Tianjin, who was reappointed after the expiration of his term.</p>
<h3>American Evacuation Ship Sails Northward Yesterday Morning; First to Qinhuangdao, Then to Korean Territory; "Washington" Scheduled to Leave Shanghai on the 21st</h3>
<p>According to the English-language Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury, the second American evacuation ship, the "Mariposa," carrying 85 American nationals, left Shanghai at 9:30 AM this morning (12th). It will sail north to Qinhuangdao and Incheon to pick up 500 American nationals from North China, Manchuria, and Korea, and return them to the United States.</p>
<p>The passengers are American businessmen and the wives and children of American Marine Corps officers, who are evacuating at the recommendation of the U.S. State Department. When the "Mariposa" weighed anchor this morning, there were few people to see them off at Piers 11 and 12. However, the American children on board were bustling and running around, while the American women were reluctant to leave. Some had tears in their eyes. These American women and children had brought their suitcases and luggage to the Customs Wharf last night (11th) to bid farewell to their husbands and friends.</p>
<p>After reluctantly parting and wishing each other an early reunion, they boarded the ferry to transfer to the "Mariposa." The "Mariposa" is expected to arrive in Qinhuangdao on Thursday morning and sail out that afternoon, arriving in Incheon, Korea on Saturday. It will weigh anchor that evening. The ship's plan to dock in Kobe, Japan, has been canceled, but the U.S. President Lines has not disclosed which other ports it will dock at after leaving Incheon. At the same time, American nationals in Shanghai are waiting for the third and final evacuation ship, the "Washington," to arrive here on the morning of the 17th of this month. It is expected that the "Washington" will leave Shanghai on the 21st, carrying several hundred American nationals from Shanghai, more than the "Mariposa," because the "Mariposa's" economy class was reserved for American nationals from North China.</p>
<h3>Yipinxiang Hotel Entrance: Lin Zijiong Shot Dead; Lin Was Secretary of the "Chinese Workers Welfare Association"; Assassin Lay in Wait and Shot Him When He Went Out</h3>
<p>At around 1:30 PM yesterday, a shooting occurred suddenly in front of the Yipinxiang Hotel on Yu Qiaqing Road in the Public Concession. The victim was identified as Lin Zijiong, the "Secretary-General of the Chinese Workers Welfare Association" of a certain organization. He was hit by three bullets in the head and died on the spot. The details of the incident are as follows:</p>
<p>Lodged in the Hotel, Renamed Lin Jun</p>
<p>Lin Zijiong, a Minnan person from Taiwan, was over forty years old. He rented a Western-style house at No. 2 Xingcun, Yuyuan Road, in western Shanghai. He served as the "Secretary-General of the Chinese Workers Welfare Association" of a Japanese organization and as a consultant to the East Asia Anti-Communist League. He owned a private car with the license plate number 10010. With a robust physique, he arrived at the Yipinxiang Hotel at No. 207 Yu Qiaqing Road in his private car at 4:00 PM on the 10th, seeking a room to stay in. He was led by the staff into Room No. 2 on the right side of the lower-level entrance and paid a room fee of 40 yuan, claiming to be Lin Jun.</p>
<p>Went Out to Board Car, Assassin Lay in Ambush</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, after Lin got up and finished washing, he immediately asked the attendant to change rooms and moved into Room No. 4 next door. Yesterday, at around 1:30 PM, Lin, dressed in a gray tweed suit, leather shoes, and a gray thick woolen overcoat, was on his way to see a friend. As soon as he arrived at the pedestrian path north of the hotel entrance, his private car, parked there, and the chauffeur was opening the door to welcome the owner. Unexpectedly, just as Lin was about to step into the car, a young assassin lying in ambush nearby,</p>
<p>Three Shots Hit, Died Instantly</p>
<p>Raised his gun and ambushed him, firing several shots in succession. Three shots hit him, wounding his head, causing his brains to splatter, and he collapsed, falling on the sidewalk. Seeing that his purpose had been achieved, the assassin abandoned his weapon and fled north without a trace. The chauffeur, stunned and helpless, stared blankly. After the assassin left, he shouted for help. When the Chinese police officer stationed at the corner of Hankou Road and Moore Memorial Church heard the news and rushed over, the young man had already disappeared.</p>
<p>Stayed for Three Days, Frequent Socializing</p>
<p>The police immediately called the Lao Zha Police Station and dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to rush to the scene. They found several bullet casings at the scene of the incident and took them to the police station for inspection to conduct an investigation. The body was transported to the morgue of Renji Hospital by ambulance to be prepared for examination. When the reporter arrived at the aforementioned location to investigate after hearing the news, he caught sight of blood splattered everywhere on the sidewalk and brains splattering, which was unbearable to witness. It was learned that Lin had been staying at the hotel for three days, and friends and acquaintances had been visiting him frequently every day. As for the cause of the assassination, the police are currently investigating in detail.</p>
<h3>French Concession Tram and Bus Fares to Increase Starting Today: First Class Minimum 5 Fen, Third Class Minimum 4 Fen</h3>
<p>After the increase in water and electricity rates in the French Concession was approved by the Municipal Council and implemented from the 6th of this month, the increase in bus and tram fares was delayed due to more complicated procedures. It was only announced to the public yesterday. Yesterday, notices were posted on all vehicles running in the French Concession, stating that the company's vehicles would increase fares starting on the 13th (today) in accordance with the newly revised price list. The amount of the increase is 30% of the original price.

Tram and trolley fares have also increased by 1 fen to 3 fen.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Expands Financial Network to Protect Overseas Remittances, Organizes Trust Investments, and Offers Generous Interest</h3>
<p>Overseas Chinese remit a huge amount of money back to the country every year, which is an important financial source for balancing China's foreign financial income and expenditure. Unexpectedly, since the outbreak of the war, the Japanese side has repeatedly attempted to seize the foreign exchange of overseas Chinese remittances to the country. According to information from the local financial sector, in order to thwart this conspiracy, the Ministry of Finance has completed the expansion of the overseas remittance financial network and is coordinating with the Bank of China, the Postal Savings Bureau, and banks run by provinces or businesses overseas to facilitate the remittance needs of overseas Chinese, so as not to be seized by the Japanese. In addition, preferential measures have been established to provide maximum convenience in remittance procedures.</p>
<p>Reduce Remittance Fees</p>
<p>After the completion of this expanded overseas Chinese remittance financial network, overseas Chinese can entrust remittances to the Bank of China or other commissioned banks for remittance to the country. The Ministry of Finance has not only organized overseas remittance collection offices in major cities abroad to reduce remittance fees and simplify procedures for overseas Chinese remittances, but has also entrusted various shops in domestic towns and villages to pay remittances on their behalf.</p>
<p>Trust Investment</p>
<p>In order to serve the families of overseas Chinese, the Ministry of Finance is also handling matters related to the deposit of remittances from overseas Chinese in various provinces of the interior, including small loans for dependents of overseas Chinese. In addition, trust investment measures have also been established for overseas Chinese who wish to make investments, offering generous interest. Therefore, the Japanese attempt to seize overseas Chinese remittances has been thwarted. There is no doubt that the amount of overseas remittances will increase even further.</p>

<h3>Disturbance Erupts Again in Hongkou Yesterday, Two Japanese Officers Hit by Bullets, Assailant Was a Japanese Soldier and Has Fled Afterward, Details of the Case Are Kept Secret by the Japanese Side</h3>
<p>At 9:30 AM yesterday, a Japanese military police sergeant was shot by a fellow soldier of the same unit on Qiujiang Road and Haskel Road. However, the Japanese authorities have remained silent on this matter. It is generally believed that the attack stemmed from a quarrel between the two. Whether the assailant is at large or has been captured was not known yesterday. Japanese army and navy officials all claimed ignorance of the matter. The incident occurred outside the Public Concession, so the Police Department is not investigating it. It is reported that the wounded sergeant has been flown to a Japanese military hospital, and his injuries are quite serious. It is generally believed that the assailant fired three shots. When Hongkou was in a state of commotion and confusion at 9:30 AM yesterday, the Police Department and the Japanese authorities thought that an attack had occurred on a high-ranking Japanese officer, so they blocked bridges, searched pedestrians, and caused great disturbances. It was not until it was discovered that the Japanese had started the dispute themselves and shot a sergeant that the alert was relaxed after 10:00 AM.</p>
<p>Japanese Side Knows Who the Assailant Is</p>
<p>The Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury reported that a disturbance broke out again in Hongkou this morning (the 12th). The incident occurred shortly after 10:15 AM when a Japanese person assassinated another Japanese person near Qiujiang Road and North Sichuan Road. It is generally believed that the victim was a high-ranking officer in the Japanese army. The assailant fired several shots at the officer and then fled immediately. It is reported that the Japanese authorities know who the assailant is.</p>
<p>Bridges Blocked and Extensive Searches Conducted</p>
<p>After the incident, the Japanese immediately implemented strict measures throughout the Hongkou area. All bridges on the Suzhou Creek were blocked, and traffic was cut off. After more than half an hour, traffic was allowed to resume, but the Japanese military police and Japanese marines continued to conduct strict searches. Public Concession police officers also assisted in searching vehicles and pedestrians leaving Hongkou at the southern ends of the Suzhou Creek bridges.</p>
<p>Nine Assassinations of Military Personnel Have Occurred</p>
<p>Since September 29, this is the ninth time that Japanese military personnel in the Shanghai area have been attacked by snipers. The details at that time were not fully known, and the Japanese authorities did not disclose who the victim was. Officials only stated that they were conducting an investigation to apprehend the assassin. As for the reason for the assassination, they refused to disclose it. However, it is generally believed that the two Japanese people had a dispute, which led to the shooting.</p>
<p>Details of the Case Are Absolutely Secret</p>
<p>Some people also believe that both Japanese people were drunk, but this has not been confirmed. The Japanese authorities are keeping secret who was shot this morning and how serious their injuries are. This may be evidence that the victim was an important person. It is rumored that the victim was hit by two bullets and is currently in a Japanese military hospital, seriously injured, but this has not been confirmed either.</p>
<h3>Reorganizing the Moral Endeavor Society's Lost and Found Service</h3>
<p>In order to further promote morality, the Chinese Reorganization Moral Endeavor Society has established a Lost and Found Service. All important documents, passbooks, receipts, wallets, keys, seals, valuable items, etc. lost on the road, on vehicles, or in public places can be registered. The details are managed by Tian Jizhu and sponsored by the institute. Everything has now begun to be organized, and the agreement of the authorities has been obtained. Once the address is determined, it will be officially established. At that time, if there are any of the above incidents, the institute will do its best to serve all sectors of society with a fair position. The institute is still a pioneer in Shanghai and will be welcomed by the public.</p>
<h3>Decision to Continue the Price Stabilization Program, Financial Shortage, Hoping for Generous Donations from All Quarters</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Price Stabilization Committee has been established since January 5 of this year and has now been in operation for eleven months. It has organized two price stabilization programs, including a total of three phases in the first program, selling 100,296 bags of tribute rice, with a loss of more than 718,400 yuan. The second program also organized three phases of price stabilization, selling more than 30,000 bags of tribute rice, with a loss of more than 200,000 yuan. Now it has reached the third program, with the first phase starting on the 1st of this month. It was originally intended to temporarily end the program after selling out the remaining tribute rice, but in order to cope with winter relief, it is now making every effort to raise funds and decided to continue the second phase of the third price stabilization program in mid-December, so that ordinary people can survive the winter. However, this matter is of great importance and requires a large amount of funds. It is hoped that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will actively donate generously in order to gather strength from all.</p>
<p>The Datong News Agency reported that according to news from the Ningbo Native Place Association in Shanghai, the price of rice in Ningbo, except for early rice, which is still priced as before, Lake White and late rice will be increased to 38.5 yuan per stone from today. The urban area will add a profit of 1.5 yuan, selling for 40 yuan per stone, and the countryside will add a profit of 7 jiao, selling for 39.2 yuan per stone. The above selling price of rice is much lower than that in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>More Than 10,000 Jewish Refugees Are Living in Panic, Jewish Merchants Are Mostly Wealthy and Will Appeal for Assistance</h3>
<p>There are more than 14,000 Jewish people from Germany and Austria in Shanghai, who are provided with food and lodging by Jewish refugee relief agencies. More than 2,000 of them live in refugee camps in Hongkou, while the rest are scattered throughout Hongkou. They have three meals a day, and their lives are still considered comfortable. Recently, due to a shortage of funds, meals have been reduced, and the situation is very serious. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Living in Panic</p>
<p>Since the large influx of European Jewish refugees into Shanghai in the second half of last year, 200,000 yuan in donations have been received from all parties in the past two years. Among them, Shanghai wealthy merchant Sassoon donated 150,000 yuan alone to solve the livelihood problems of these Jewish people. Jewish people in the United States have also donated money for relief. However, the amount of donations from Shanghai Jewish people has decreased significantly in recent days, and the funds from American Jewish people have also failed to arrive due to the situation. Therefore, the lives of more than 10,000 disaster victims are in great panic. The relief agencies in charge have had to take special measures, reducing daily supplies from three meals to one meal. Other bread and butter have also been reduced as appropriate. The relief agencies have now telegraphed American Jewish people, requesting continued assistance.</p>
<p>Urgently Awaiting Relief</p>
<p>Yesterday, according to news from the Jewish community, if such a difficult situation continues, the relief agencies will appeal to local Jewish merchants for assistance, because they have the power to donate money for the relief of Jewish refugees. Recently, Russian Jewish people in Shanghai purchased the club of the American Maillines team for a high price of 1 million yuan. This shows that Jewish people are indeed wealthy. More than 10,000 refugees are in urgent need of relief. Yesterday, it was rumored that several staff members of the European Jewish refugee relief agencies in Shanghai would resign in the short term due to the failure to raise funds, and there would be major internal adjustments.</p>
<p>Immigration Issue</p>
<p>In addition, it was reported that the New York Jewish Refugee Relief Society telegraphed Jewish groups in Shanghai last month, stating that the British government had agreed to the immigration of Jewish people to Honduras. The committee will send representatives here to arrange the matter, instructing Jewish groups in Shanghai to determine how many Jewish refugee families are willing to go to Honduras and can provide the necessary US$300. However, according to recent telegrams from Shanghai, the State Department in Washington did not approve the issuance of passports for the representatives to come to Shanghai, but did not explain the reason. According to the general Jewish refugees, it may be because of the political situation in the Far East that they cannot be allowed to come here. However, this does not prevent the immigration of Jewish refugees to Honduras. Jewish groups in Shanghai are now notifying Jewish refugees to handle the matter themselves. Those who wish to go to British Honduras should apply for registration immediately.</p>
<h3>Plague Spreads Severely in Ningbo, Six More Deaths</h3>
<p>The plague situation in Ningbo is becoming more serious. According to a Ningbo telegram yesterday, Ye Shutang, the leader of the Central Epidemic Prevention Team, arrived in Ningbo with nine team members and set up the team headquarters at the Xiang Elementary School on Cangjiwei Street. They have already started work to assist the Yin County Epidemic Prevention Office in eradicating the plague. Chen Wanli, the director of the Zhejiang Provincial Health Department, passed through Jinhua with the Central Epidemic Prevention Team and came to Ningbo, staying at the Ping An Hotel. It is reported that he brought a large number of anti-vaccines, which can be used to inject 30,000 people. Director Chen and all the staff held a review meeting on epidemic prevention work in the county government conference room, with detailed discussions on various facilities for eradicating the plague. In the future, Captain Ye will inspect the old Longkou burial ground outside the South Gate with the staff of the Yin County Epidemic Prevention Office, and make improvements to disinfection and isolation work. In addition, four more people died in the Isolation Hospital yesterday. Two employees of the Lao Dayouhao store on Zhongshan East Road died of the plague in the store. The bodies were transported to the old Longkou burial ground by the Epidemic Prevention Office burial team.</p>
<p>Telegram from Ningbo</p>
<p>The Ningbo Native Place Association in Shanghai received a telegram from Ningbo, which stated: Secretly, the previous two telegrams have been received. The plague blockade area has been carefully discussed by specialized personnel from the Central Epidemic Prevention Team, the Provincial Health Department, and local people. It has been decided that in addition to the deeds, account books, and other valuables in the area being removed for disinfection, all houses and those that cannot be disinfected will be burned. Landlords and tenants will be issued relief funds as appropriate to show sympathy. An Epidemic Area Rehabilitation Committee will be formed to take charge, with Zhou Dalie and Mao Jiasheng appointed as chairman and vice-chairman, respectively, and committee members actively carrying out the work. Patients admitted to the Isolation Hospital continue to die. There is no phenomenon of spreading outside the area. More to come. Xu Zhen and Yu Jimin kowtow together. Sincerely.</p>
<h3>Transshipment of Qiaobao Shipping Goods Via Hong Kong, Direct Shipping Between Shanghai and Myanmar is Not Economically Viable</h3>
<p>Since the reopening of the Yunnan-Burma Road, shipping on the Shanghai-Myanmar route has resumed. However, there has always been a lack of direct shipping, and most of the goods are transshipped to Yangon via Hong Kong and Singapore. Now, foreign shipping companies, due to the blockage of the Yunnan-Vietnam Road and the suspension of shipping on the Shanghai-Vietnam route, and the reopening of the Yunnan-Burma Road, are planning direct shipping between Shanghai and Myanmar to clear the cargo transportation from Shanghai to the interior. However, due to the long distance, it is not economical for ship schedules and freight rates. Therefore, it has not been realized so far and can only be transshipped to Yangon via Hong Kong and Singapore, and then transported to the interior. Recently, the American merchant Qiaobao has a load capacity of 5,000 tons and is managed by the Qiacheng Shipping Company at No. 12 Bund. It is scheduled to depart directly for Hong Kong on the 15th of this month. The company is responsible for transshipping goods to the interior via Hong Kong to their destination. It has also set up a special transshipment department to handle the transshipment of goods from Shanghai to Yangon and then to Kunming. It is reported that the Qiaobao is carrying no less than 2,000 tons of goods to be transshipped to Kunming.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Provincial Transport Administration to be Established Soon, Jiang Jiaming Appointed as Deputy Director</h3>
<p>According to transportation circles, the director of the Zhejiang Provincial Transport Administration will be concurrently held by the director of the Construction Department, as stipulated. Jiang Jiaming has been appointed by the Ministry of Transportation as the deputy director, and the Zhejiang Provincial Government has been telegraphed to expedite the establishment of the administration. It is reported that the Construction Department has actively prepared and will be established in the short term.</p>
<h3>Japanese Merchant's Car Accident Causes Injury to Ten Chinese Workers, The Car Was Overcrowded With More Than 90 People, The Railing Broke and Workers Fell Down</h3>
<p>Near the Shanghai University of Engineering on Jungong Road, Yangshupu, in eastern Shanghai, the Japanese are building a large-scale shipyard for the manufacture and repair of ships. The project is contracted by the Japanese merchant Okura Civil Engineering Company, which has recruited a large number of Chinese workers to carry out construction day and night. Five trucks from the Japanese merchant Yoshizaki Transportation Company at No. 9 Pingliang Road are used to transport Chinese workers to the above-mentioned location for work, picking them up and dropping them off, as usual. At dawn at 6:30 AM yesterday, the company, as usual, dispatched five trucks to the Chinese workers' gathering place to transport them to work. One of the trucks, No. 20019, was fully loaded with more than 90 people at the corner of the Pingliang Road Small Vegetable Market (the gathering place). When it drove to Guiyang Road, due to the excessive number of people, the connecting bamboo shoots on the left side of the railing suddenly broke, causing a major disaster, resulting in ten workers falling down and injuring themselves. At that time, the crowd was clamorous, and the order was greatly disrupted. Ju Qiluo was injured in the head and feet; Tang Xingjiao was injured in both feet; Wang Furong, from Shaoxing, was injured in the left foot; Chen Jiabao, from Ningbo, was injured in the right arm; Li Asan, from Huzhou, was injured in the left foot; Jiang Fengzheng, from Ningbo, was injured in the lips; Wang Ayao, a local, was injured in the head and feet; Jin Xiaoliuzi, from Yancheng, was injured in the feet and face.

<h3>Swapped Small Bills, Robbers Arrested, Another Robber Surrenders to Police, All Detained Pending Further Interrogation of Accomplices</h3>
<p>Cheng Qin'guan, a wealthy merchant from Ningbo, runs the Dafaxiang Hardware Store at No. 4, Lane 178, Wuchang Road, and the Jiuda Money Exchange at No. 648, North Sichuan Road, which has recently been coveted by robbers. At 6:00 PM on the 9th, when Cheng's employees and others were having dinner in his hardware store, robbers suddenly entered one after another. The two robbers took out pistols, threatened the 17 employees not to shout or go out, and began to search.</p>
<p>Cheng's Wife and Children</p>
<p>Etc., also lived upstairs. The robbers then went upstairs to ransack the boxes and cabinets, taking everything. After a while, Mr. Cheng returned to the store from the Jiuda Money Exchange and was aimed at in the chest by a robber who demanded that he hand over the key to the silver box, otherwise his life would not be guaranteed. Cheng had no choice but to let the robber take the key from his pocket and open the silver box, and was robbed of legal tender and Korean bank five-jiao bills, as well as Cheng's gold ring on his finger and,</p>
<p>Coats and Ornaments</p>
<p>Worth a total of 13,550 yuan, and fled in different directions. Afterwards, according to reports, the Hongkou Police Department had no leads on the capture of the robbers. The victim, Cheng Qin'guan, with the Korean bank five-jiao bills that were robbed, worth more than 4,000 yuan, notified his Jiuda Money Exchange on North Sichuan Road to pay attention. At about 10:00 AM the next morning, a robber from Jiangbei, Pan Yuecai, tried to exchange the five-jiao bills for 100 yuan of legal tender, and the employee</p>
<p>Interrogated Him</p>
<p>His words were evasive, so he detained him and shouted "robber!" Pan was in a hurry to abandon the bills and flee, and was caught by officer No. 87 of the Hongkou Police Department. A total of 107.5 yuan of the same five-jiao bills and 20.3 yuan of legal tender were found on his body and brought to the police department. He confessed that his accomplice, Fang Dengliang, was hiding at No. 43, Meile Road, but he was not found. In the afternoon, Fang came to the police department with a lawyer, Zhong. The police chief ordered him to be detained. Yesterday, he was sent to the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin applied for detention, saying that there were still five accomplices at large. After Huang Risheng, the judge, interrogated him, he ordered him to be returned to custody and rescheduled for further verification.</p>

<h3>Small Champagne Lottery by Racecourse Affiliates: Public Drawing Yesterday</h3>
<p>First Prize Wins Over Ten Thousand Eight Hundred Yuan</p>
<p>The Small Champagne Lottery tickets issued by the Shanghai Racecourse Affiliates Club have become increasingly popular for more than a decade. This year, sales were particularly brisk. This is because the club's lottery methods have always been open and transparent, and they follow the Large Champagne Lottery methods of the Racecourse General Association, so their credit is outstanding, and everyone is happy to purchase them.

<h3>Twenty Thousand Fans Rejoice: Donghua and Lacrosse Draw 2-2; Tie in the Last Ten Minutes</h3>
<p>The first Huai De Cup charity football invitational match between Donghua and Lacrosse was fought at Yiyuan at 2:30 PM yesterday. No goals were scored in the first half. In the second half, Donghua scored first, but then lost two consecutive goals. Down 1-2 in a very difficult situation, they managed to tie in the last ten minutes, much to the joy of 20,000 fans. It was originally planned to extend the game by thirty minutes to determine the winner, but the two sides agreed not to continue the match. The big silver cup will remain with the Lido Sports Association, and each team will get a small silver cup. It is heard that Nanhua College still intends to find a way to invite the two teams to compete again, pending approval from the Shanghai Western Football Association.</p>

<p>Mr. Yu Qiaqing Arrives to Kick Off</p>
<p>Portugal loaned troops to strengthen Lacrosse's strength. Donghua, on the other hand, has recently won five consecutive games in Group A. Therefore, the strength of the two sides is evenly matched, attracting about 20,000 fans, which was extremely popular. However, according to Yiyuan's report, only more than 12,000 yuan was earned from ticket sales yesterday. At 2:30 PM, the curtain opened to the sound of music. Yuan Ludeng, Chairman of the Nanhua Children's Education Institute, and Lieutenant Lee Te, Chairman of the Shanghai Western Football Association, delivered speeches. Mr. Yu Qiaqing also arrived in time to kick off. After that, the two armies began to engage.</p>
<p>2,700 Yuan to Purchase the Ball</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Nanhua Children's Education Institute specially dispatched dozens of members of the institute's band to play at the stadium to help the football match. During the halftime break after the first half, Yu Qiaqing and Yuan Ludeng hosted a football auction to increase donation income. Starting at 500 yuan, the price quickly rose to more than 1,000 yuan. It is a great joy to do good deeds and not be left behind. After competing with each other, Shao Daren finally won, with a bid of 2,700 yuan, setting an unprecedented high price for the auction of a match ball. His benevolence and righteousness are admirable. After the game, the Lido Sports Association hosted a banquet for the players and Chinese and foreign reporters last night. Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Ludeng, and personnel from the Western Football Association attended. During the banquet, Yu and representatives from both Donghua and Lacrosse stood up to deliver speeches, and everyone dispersed happily.</p>
<p>Donghua Focused on Defense Yesterday</p>
<p>In yesterday's game, Lacrosse had more opportunities than Donghua. In the first half, Donghua narrowly avoided three certain goals, which can be considered lucky. Lacrosse's fierce attack failed to score. Donghua's defense yesterday was very hardworking. The center back and two fullbacks, as well as Qin Bi Gao, deserve credit. However, the forwards were not well-coordinated. Sun Lufang is still not able to stand alone, and because the inside forwards are not effective, the enemy's ball flows in continuously, which is a major loophole. After Li Yichen gained an advantage, he became lazy and unwilling to run. Yichen is already like Hong Kong's Shi Dulanzhi, and it would be best for him to play as a fullback or center back. But what can Donghua do about the lack of forwards? Lacrosse is young and strong, and their steps are as swift as the wind. Atege, McDonald, and Ke Lasha are still as impressive as before, and their situation is better than Donghua's.</p>
<p>No Separation of Each Other: No Score Recorded</p>
<p>Le Xiurong has not whistled for a long time, and yesterday he also performed referee duties for the charity match. Lacrosse goalkeeper Shi Nizhong was unable to attend due to injury, and was replaced by Moso Di and Gu Fu. After the start of the game, the Lacrosse team drove straight in. Fortunately, Qin's eyes were quick, and they were not scored on. Li Yichen intercepted the ball and passed it to Jia Youliang. Jia hooked the ball in, and the center forward took over, kicking it too lightly and failing to score. Sun Lufang made a wonderful cut, but unfortunately, Li stepped on it, and he was too anxious, and the sure-fire shot went over the net. After Donghua lost this good opportunity, the defense became tight. Lacrosse's Atege and Kaitepei had many dangerous shots, but Qin rescued them one by one. Han Longhai was agile and resourceful, and also saved many crises. The two fullbacks, Zhuang and Li, worked extremely hard, so although the Lacrosse team worked hard to attack, they were ultimately unable to overcome Donghua's defense. No goals were scored in the first half. When the silver whistle sounded, the score was still tied at zero.</p>
<p>Breaking Through the Siege: A Tie</p>
<p>After the lemon break, Donghua's Fei Chunhua was unable to play due to injury, and Li Yichen temporarily filled in as center forward, assisted by Huang Kehou on the left and right. Lacrosse's lineup remained unchanged, with only Simmons and Kaitepei exchanging positions. After Donghua kicked off, they immediately adopted a lightning-fast offensive. Eight minutes into the game, Liang Shutang sent the ball to the center line. Li Yichen got the ball and shot, hitting Jia Youliang and bouncing in, opening the scoring. The Lacrosse team launched a major counterattack. Atege got the ball in the middle and kicked it, but Qin was unable to save it, and they lost the goal. A tie was made 1-1. Not three minutes later, Atege repeated the trick, entering the hinterland from the boundary line and tossing the ball to the center. Ke Lasha took the opportunity to dial it in. Bi Gao pounced, but the ball slipped over his head. 1-2, Donghua was behind. At less than twelve minutes after the start, enemy cavalry was spread all over the Donghua penalty area. The Lacrosse army besieged Donghua for as long as twenty minutes. The ball never left Donghua. Everyone expected Donghua to be defeated, but who knew that Donghua was very lucky and broke through the siege. At 35 minutes, Han Longhai passed the ball to Jia Youliang. Jia dribbled the whole baseline and hooked it in. Huang Kehou dribbled the ball into the net, 2-2, tying the score again. The final whistle blew, ending the game in a 2-2 draw. Finally, Mr. Yuan Ludeng awarded the prizes and everyone dispersed.</p>

<h3>Recruiting Muslim Students</h3>
<p>And providing freedom and convenience in religion (Hong Kong Correspondent) The Sixth Branch School of the Central Military Academy in Guilin has been recruiting a large number of Muslim students since the 15th term in order to cultivate domestic military talents. Many graduates have served in various provinces such as Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai, which are suitable for their talents, and their achievements are remarkable. They have been praised by the highest military authorities. Because there is still an urgent need for talents in the northwest, the Sixth Branch School in Guilin is recruiting a large team of Muslim students in order to adapt to the environment and cultivate talents. It is entrusted to the branches of the National Salvation Association of Muslims in various places and the Hong Kong Islamic Charity Association to recommend them. Those who are 18 years old or older, have a junior high school education or above, and are in good health are qualified. Muslim students receiving training are not only given freedom and convenience in terms of dietary habits and religion, but also follow the rules of the religion in addition to academic subjects, and can take lessons in religious doctrine. The recommendation matters should be completed within half a month in order to facilitate the start of classes. After hearing the news, the Islamic groups in Hong Kong held a meeting to discuss it. They all believed that since the fall of Guangzhou, many Islamic youth had lost their opportunities. The students were suffering from not being able to settle down. This was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and they decided to register. The enthusiastic youth were enthusiastically signing up, hoping to learn and use what they had learned in the future and serve the motherland. The registration will be closed during the day, and the joint examination and recommendation will be carried out. The travel expenses will be subsidized by the religious groups in Hong Kong, and the students will be sent to Guilin to enroll. It is expected that the results will be good. At the same time, the Normal Department of the Guilin Beiping Chengda Normal School and the affiliated Aheng Specialist Class are also recruiting new students in Hong Kong. Tuition, accommodation, books, uniforms, etc. are all provided by the school. Students from the occupied areas and war zones can be given subsidies or scholarships. Therefore, there are also many candidates. Once the examination procedures are completed, they can immediately set off.</p>

<p>Financial Review</p>
<p>— Sheng Kaiqiong</p>
<p>—November 9— (Continued from November 11) The Economic Construction of Sichuan and Xikang</p>
<p>Judging from the economic situation before and during the war, although the wartime economic construction has achieved great success, it is still not satisfactory. From the point of view of strengthening the economic combat power, the economic construction of Sichuan and Xikang still needs the power of the whole people to engage in it in the future; First, there were very few national defense industries in China before the war. Although the government tried its best to plan and prepare, most of them failed to start production. Today, China's national defense industries such as steel, machinery, electricity, chemicals, and mining have made some achievements, and state-owned and private enterprises are proceeding simultaneously and producing at the same time. However, they are still far from the goal of self-sufficiency, and we must strive to build a broad foundation for self-reliance in the national defense industry. Second, before the war, China's rural economy was in the process of turning from decline to recovery. Unfortunately, the war broke out, and much of the effort in this area was neglected, and the efforts that were made were mostly focused on the southeast, southwest, and northwest, with little construction; Today, although Sichuan and Xikang provinces have made some progress in promoting agricultural finance, developing farmland water conservancy, promoting agricultural cooperation, and improving agricultural technology under the promotion of wartime agricultural financial policies. Especially this year, the unified agricultural loan method of the four banks in Sichuan, agricultural economic construction, is limited to local areas and has not been popularized; In particular, Xikang Province accounts for only 3.3 per thousand of the total national agricultural loan amount, and it is necessary to strive to make effective adjustments in technology and organization, and then cooperate with financial strength to provide effective assistance.</p>
<p>Economic construction in Sichuan and Xikang is important and inevitable today, when strengthening economic combat power. It is important and inevitable to establish a Sichuan and Xikang Economic Construction Committee as an actual and effective promotion agency, and how to "transfer idle funds to production and turn uselessness into usefulness" (Chairman Chiang's closing remarks to the Sichuan and Xikang Economic Construction Committee) is indeed an important issue in terms of funds in the future economic construction of Sichuan and Xikang. In order to start economic construction in Sichuan Province, the government promulgated the Sichuan Province Industrial Public Bonds Regulations on September 1 and issued public bonds worth 40 million yuan, which is not enough to "transfer idle funds to production and turn uselessness into usefulness." Of course, the idle funds absorbed by the National Savings and Construction Savings cannot be used entirely for the economic construction of Sichuan and Xikang. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a Sichuan and Xikang Industrial Company to raise funds as an actual mechanism for promoting economic construction. However, the current method of raising funds should focus on transferring idle funds to production. Therefore, the method of raising funds through public bonds with the government as the main body is really not expected in the voice of economic construction in Sichuan and Xikang. According to reliable estimates, there are 300 million yuan of idle funds in Chongqing, and in Shanghai, there are estimates of 300 million yuan, 650 million yuan, and 500 million yuan. However, there is no doubt that the idle funds in Shanghai are more than ten times that of Chongqing. Sichuan and Xikang Industrial Company should not only be able to absorb the idle funds in Chongqing, but also concentrate its efforts on absorbing the idle funds in Shanghai and transfer them to production, so as to avoid rolling in and out of the speculative market and engaging in behaviors that are detrimental to China's wartime economy.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the harsh environment in Tianjin and Beijing, because the Japanese controlled the financial funds in Tianjin and Beijing, a large amount of funds flowed south and converged to Shanghai, resulting in a congested and unbearable amount of idle funds in Shanghai. Although insightful people loudly called for the internal transfer of funds, because the Chinese government in Shanghai was still able to protect its safety, it finally did not heed the advice and engaged in speculation that was detrimental to the country. What is the environment in Shanghai today? Why don't you quickly transfer the valuable funds to the interior in the voice of economic construction in Sichuan and Xikang to seek the safety of the funds and prevent future dangers? The owners of idle funds in Shanghai, insightful financiers, and enterprising industrialists should look far ahead and not calculate gains and losses in terms of the current advantages and disadvantages of everything, weigh the pros and cons, and strive for the power of initiative. They should not only transfer their own assets to the interior, but also encourage others to transfer their assets to the interior. They should not only transform their entrepreneurial spirit in Shanghai into a spirit of building the interior, but also persuade others to transform their entrepreneurial spirit in Shanghai into a spirit of building the interior. Then, the success of the economic construction of Sichuan and Xikang is not only the success of the two provinces of Sichuan and Xikang, but also the success of the owners of idle funds, financiers, and industrialists in Shanghai.

<p>Yarn and Flower</p>
<h3>Why is there such a cotton yarn market today? In short, I am afraid that idle funds are still to blame.</h3>
<p>The rise in the yarn market was fierce, and the fall was also miserable. The rebound was also rapid. On October 1, the price of 20 count Double Horse yarn was 1,075 yuan. Because the Burma Road was unblocked, the needs of Hong Kong businessmen came one after another, and the market rose in a straight line. On the 22nd, it reached a new high of 1,302 yuan. Then, with the withdrawal of Japanese troops from Nanning, the achievement of huge Sino-British loans, and the increasing strength of the US dollar, wholesale purchases also took a slight rest. As a result, the reflection suddenly appeared, and the surplus buyers, in view of the poor environment, plummeted to break through the 1,200 yuan mark on November 4, with a price of 1,161 yuan. At this low point, it hovered for a while, but someone with abundant funds absorbed a huge amount of cotton yarn. In the midst of panic, they not only did not sell, but instead dragged in and added more. When the price fell, the shorts also lacked the courage to add more. As a result, the yarn market turned from danger to safety. It happened that many rumors of good news were flourishing, foreign exchange shrank by several decisions in one day, gold soared, and people's hearts were aroused. Speculators were very active. The fundamental problems were: (1) The cotton-producing areas were still controlled, and the source was still not satisfactory; (2) Financial loosening and abuse, it was easy to obtain pledges for goods, and the interest rate was very low, which was inferior to the shorts. However, the shorts also released long-term orders; (3) The recent prosperity of small companies changing to cotton yarn trading has exceeded the yarn houses by more than double. You buy and I sell, and the chips are locked by them, which is considerable. Once they see the opportunity, the lifting power is even stronger; (4) Although the arbitrage of 16-count yarn in the exchange this month is high, the delivery is sufficient. However, the difference between the prices of near and far months is pulled apart by nearly 100 yuan, and those who receive monthly can make arbitrage, so there is still no problem. The longs are very optimistic, and this time the Double Horse must look at the new high price; (5) Although the demand from Hong Kong has been clear recently, the 42-count, 32-count, and 10-count coarse and fine yarns are not slow to be digested, and the selling price is very high. The current ratio, the price of 20 count yarn is more reasonable; (6) As for the factory's raw cotton problem, it cannot be resolved quickly, and it will be difficult to open for sale temporarily. Some people also say that if the price is high, they may be willing to sell. In the afternoon of the previous day, the price of 20 count Double Horse yarn was 1,292 yuan. (Mountain)</p>

<h3>The Price of Large Silver Bars Did Not Move</h3>
<p>November 11 London Telegram: The price of large silver bars, both near and far, was unchanged. The small trading market was calm. After the close, the market was even more stable. The price of US silver was suspended. Another Bombay telegram: The price of Indian silver, both spot and futures, increased by four annas, and the market was stable. A total of 50 transaction orders were made.</p>

<h3>Interest on British and American Stocks—All Have Increased Income Tax—</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war, the United Kingdom has increased the income tax on general stock interest by 7.5 to 15 percent. For example, the income tax on General Electric Company's common stock dividends was 27.5 percent last year, but 42.5 percent this year. That is, for a dividend of 100 pounds, 42 and a half pounds of tax must be deducted, and the shareholder only receives 57 and a half pounds net. Also, the United States increased the income tax on dividends from 10 percent to 16.5 percent on June 26 this year. (Fu)</p>

<h3>Unified Factory Price of Coal Balls</h3>
<p>The price of coal balls used to be inconsistent due to disputes among the industry. Now, after mediation by the association, all factories have agreed that from today, Nanyang, Guohua, Dongfang, and Guanghua coal balls will follow the guidance of Yitaixing, the industry leader, and unify the factory price. The self-collection price from the car station is 140 yuan per ton, and the delivered price is 142 yuan. The retail price at the street door shop is 7 yuan and 6 jiao per load, with 14 pounds per yuan. As for the goods of other small factories, because of the inferior quality, they are also 1 or 2 jiao cheaper per load.</p>
<p>North-South Goods</p>
<h3>Longkou Noodles Rise by Over Ten Yuan</h3>
<p>Due to the recent limited arrival of vermicelli and dried noodles, coupled with the peak winter sales season, the market has suddenly become tight. Yesterday, Longkou noodles were quoted at 145 yuan, and Qingdao noodles ranged from 120 to 125 yuan, with over 300 packages sold. The remainder was shipped to Hong Kong for sale, with Longkou noodles selling for 150 yuan, Qingdao noodles for 130 yuan, and Jiangbei noodles for 98 to 100 yuan.</p>
<p>Piece Goods</p>
<h3>Woolen Fabrics and Other Goods Should Sell Well</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market for woolen fabrics became lively again with retail transactions. Due to regulatory controls, exporting shipments is extremely difficult, and various customer locations are experiencing a shortage of woolen fabrics. Market prices are significantly higher than in Shanghai, with some being 20-30% higher, and others being two to three times higher. This has led to an increase in those seeking to make individual deals, and many are trying to obtain "transportation permits." Judging by the recent trends in wool, silk, cotton, and linen fabrics, they are all firmer than last week. The prices of locally produced goods and incoming goods have rebounded accordingly. Most of the incoming goods are sold immediately upon arrival, as they have already been pre-sold before arrival, unlike the slow sales and storage seen during poor market conditions in the past. Currently, any woolen fabrics arriving at the port can generally generate a profit, with overcoat fabrics being particularly profitable. Many in the industry lament the difficulty in ensuring that orders arrive on time. Market prices: Tuesday, December 12, Year 29 Financial News</p>

<h3>The Pain of Life and the Transformation of Reality</h3>
<p>— Yu Huo</p>
<p>Perhaps it is because I am also in the professional circle, so I deeply feel the pain of professional young people in this commercial society – the depth of her pain.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the so-called source of this pain is mainly due to being "dependent on others" and "working for others," being restricted by others. In fact, such an old commercial system full of feudal atmosphere is certainly one of the reasons that cause pain to general professional young people. But today, there is no need for me to acknowledge that after a whole day of hard work, the result is still the universal contradictory phenomenon of "not having enough clothes to keep warm and not having enough food to eat." This is the biggest reason that makes the majority of professional young people tend to be depressed!</p>
<p>Therefore, some, just like the friend of Mr. Sui Zhen in this journal, complain that they see the whole life as dull and tasteless, with declining interest, and finally cannot resist the layers of pressure and are squeezed into a dead end by society!</p>
<p>Although the dead end of life is just one path, the direction of travel is multi-angled! The most vulnerable seek suicide to end their lives: those who are stronger and unwilling to commit suicide can do anything - stealing, theft, abduction, deception, robbery, everything; but some others are like suffering from nervous breakdown, treating yesterday and today the same, with numb will and a dejected attitude, "being a monk for a day and striking the bell for a day," embracing a live-for-the-moment, easygoing life philosophy. Obviously, their consistent conclusion is either to head towards the path of immediate destruction of life, or to be on the path of approaching chronic poisoning, which we can imagine.</p>
<p>If this developing trend influences our entire industrial and commercial sector, even the country and the nation, the consequences are unimaginable! Therefore, here, besides hoping that the authorities in the industrial and commercial sector will learn from this and give their colleagues in the industry a sympathetic improvement in their lives, Mr. Sui Zhen wrote in a letter from a professional young person in this journal:</p>
<p>"... In the current environment, don't be too optimistic or too pessimistic. Use both hands and brain, reason and emotion at the same time..." Such self-persevering struggle is indeed what every professional partner should regard as a guide.</p>
<p>However, struggle is not a blind thing. Understanding one's own environment and determining the goals of the struggle should be the primary conditions.</p>
<p>"You are burdened by food and clothing, most of which is naturally a social problem, but a small part is still in yourself..." This is how Mr. Sui Zhen analyzes to his friends in this journal the reasons for being burdened by food and clothing. We don't know what Mr. Sui Zhen's friends are actually like, but generally speaking, their situation is not much different from that of colleagues in the entire industrial and commercial sector. Then it seems that the pressure of life that everyone is suffering from, due to personal reasons, can only account for a very small part, such as personal "enduring hardship and hard work," wearing labor clothes when you can't afford a long gown, and eating vegetable rice when you can't afford delicacies... Generally speaking, colleagues in the industrial and commercial sector can do this. However, the difficulties in life are still not easy to solve. Some even seek a job just to get food, and it is unattainable (the situation of hunger and cold in life is self-evident). Even if I personally speak, my personal freezing and hunger can be barely overcome, but I cannot take care of my elderly father, mother, wife, and weak younger siblings. Such concrete facts are truly innumerable in today's industrial and commercial sector? From the recognition of real life, the stubbornness and unfairness of this social system is the main reason for the hardship of life, we feel.</p>
<p>"Break the reality, transform the reality!" This should be the consistent call of industrial and commercial colleagues! Naturally, this kind of dissatisfaction with reality and courage to transform is a glory of our young people and should be sought by everyone. Next, the flashing question in front of us is how to carry out the struggle to transform reality? And more importantly, it is to determine the goals of our struggle.</p>
<p>Due to the heavy and long-term oppression of life on the general industrial and commercial colleagues, most of them regard relieving their own pain as the main thing, which is undeniable. However, as the desire for dissatisfaction grows in the enjoyment of life, most people yearn for cars that fly like wind and electricity, and noble and majestic foreign houses. So they exhaust their "struggle," trying to climb high in their jobs, in order to reach the point of "comfortable life." Some people with bigger ambitions may hope to become officials or even great men...</p>
<p>Here, we should not criticize their aspirations for upward mobility, but what is very undesirable is to only seek the improvement of personal status and enjoyment. Taking "egoism" as the starting point, we may not agree with the current struggle goals of general industrial and commercial colleagues! Because we feel that the development of the "small self" can at most become the master of the lives of the next generation of industrial and commercial colleagues, and it has nothing to do with the relief of the pain of our entire industrial and commercial colleagues! If we want to examine the results of "transforming reality," but it is only in its "own," this is a joke!</p>
<p>Let us examine the current suffering (not just the industrial and commercial colleagues), recognize the source of the environment, determine the "unselfish" upward goal, do not be passive, do not act blindly, and struggle hard - intellectual struggle, business struggle... to achieve everyone's goal of transforming reality in many ways.</p>
<p>Hawthorne's Investigation</p>
<h3>The Homecoming of the Dancing Queen</h3>
<p>— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter 11: Zhao Baixiong's Confession</p>
<p>Hawthorne was playing with a paper knife on the desk. His eyes were focused on the knife, seemingly intentionally and unintentionally, as he said softly, "What misunderstanding do you want to explain?"</p>
<p>Zhao Baixiong said, "Mr. Hawthorne, don't you believe that I killed Wang Lilan?" Hawthorne's gaze remained fixed on the sharp-pointed, bone-handled knife in his hand. "Well, the misunderstanding lies on your side. I know you had the intention and plan to kill Lilan, and you have fully implemented your plan in action. However, the one who truly caused Lilan's death was not you, but someone else."</p>
<p>Zhao Baixiong's body suddenly straightened completely, his angular eyes widened, and he closed his mouth tightly, staring at Hawthorne in surprise. Hawthorne tapped the tip of the knife with his finger, making a soft sound, completely ignoring him. Zhao Baixiong slowly reached into his pocket, took out a white towel, and gently wiped his forehead and cheeks. This wipe actually created a miracle of returning to youth. By the time he took the towel down, it was stained with a lot of rouge color. The wrinkles on his face had completely disappeared.</p>
<p>Zhao Baixiong apologized, "Mr. Hawthorne, I am really ashamed. I initially underestimated you. Now I understand that you are truly remarkable. Your brain, eyesight, and courage are all admirable."</p>
<p>Hawthorne waved his hand again. "Mr. Zhao, don't talk nonsense. Now please tell me the facts of what happened in detail, so that I don't have to explain it to my friend in a hypothetical way. I believe Mr. Bao Lang will be happier to hear you narrate it yourself than for me to explain it indirectly."</p>
<p>Zhao Baixiong turned his head to look at me, with a smile on his lips, and then nodded. But before he could begin to narrate his story, another small incident occurred. Shi Gui sneaked into the office, walked to Hawthorne's side, and whispered a few words in his ear. Hawthorne nodded and said, "No need to wait, tell Kang Nian to go back to the hall." Then he stood up, followed Shi Gui to the office entrance, and closed the door after Shi Gui left. When he returned to his seat, he nodded to Zhao Baixiong, indicating that he should begin to narrate his story.</p>
<p>Zhao Baixiong said, "Mr. Hawthorne, you are right, I did have the intention and plan to kill Wang Lilan, and I did carry it out. But before I narrate, there is a prerequisite. Mr. Hawthorne, do you know the truth about this woman? What recent actions has she taken?" (164)</p>
<h3>On Eating "Charity Rice"</h3>
<p>— Xin Meng</p>
<p>Recently, we saw in the newspaper that a charity education organization had committed fraud. This case is currently being investigated by the person in charge. We do not yet know the truth, so we cannot make a definite criticism. But whether or not it is fraud, it has given us a bad impression.</p>
<p>We know that in the past many people have used the name of charity to raise donations, with the aim of profiting from it. So little of the actual benefit reaches the people awaiting relief. Especially in Shanghai, where the situation is so complex, there are many people who eat charity rice, and the so-called pseudo-philanthropists are truly hateful.</p>
<p>Since the "August 13th Incident," I don't know how many people have extorted or embezzled donations in the name of charity. Even the staff working in the shelters have deducted rice and used various despicable means to enrich themselves.</p>
<p>It should be known that if people who run charitable organizations collect money under false pretenses or commit fraud, although their motive is self-interest, the impact is significant. First, whether it is fraud or extortion, the money they pocket results in untold suffering for those who do not receive benefits. Second, it will make wealthy people who want to donate generously turn away. Wouldn't this make the fundraising problem for charitable organizations even more difficult?</p>
<p>Therefore, we sincerely advise general pseudo-philanthropists and those who commit fraud while serving in charitable organizations: You should ask yourselves, is it right to deprive the poor of the benefits they deserve by using the name of charity? Do you still have a conscience?</p>

<h3>Recent Events of the Three Major Opera Schools in the Former Capital</h3>
<p>— Yu Chu</p>
<p>The Fu Liancheng Society was founded over three decades ago. It was originally funded by Niu Zihou, a wealthy merchant from Jilin, and co-managed by Ye Chunshan, known as the Xi Liancheng Troupe. Later, Shen Xiushui took over and changed the name to the current one. The position of president is still held by Ye Chunxi. After Ye's death, his eldest son Longzhang took over, with his third son Shengzhang assisting him. The teachers they hired, such as Xiao Changhua, Cai Ronggui, Lei Xifu, Guo Chunshan, Hou Xirui, Wang Lianping, and others, are all famous figures in the Peking Opera world. There are countless students who have graduated and enjoyed great fame, among whom Ma Lianliang, Yu Suquan (i.e., Xiao Cuihua), Tan Fuying, Li Shengzao, Ye Shenglan, Mao Shilai, and others are outstanding. The arrangement of their classes starts with the character "Xi" as the first class, followed by "Lian," "Fu," "Sheng," and "Shi," with seven years as the first class. Now it has been arranged to the Xin "Yuan" character. Among the "Yuan" generation, only Guo Fen recently followed Ma Lianliang to the south, which was observational in nature. Most of the others are still in school. Those who have gradually shown their talent include the martial arts actors Huang Wuqing, Xu Shan (son of Lan Yuan), and the female impersonator Liu Yuantong.</p>
<p>The Chinese Opera School was established in 1930, originally named the Peking Opera Music Institute, with Jiao Shuizhi as the school principal. In 1935, it was reorganized and Jin Huilu was hired as the president. At the same time, the school name was changed to the Chinese Advanced Opera Vocational School. Its organization is quite complete. In addition to teaching opera, it also teaches applied courses such as Chinese, English, arithmetic, physics, and chemistry, making it the most ideal opera school. Regarding opera teaching, there are Wang Yaoqing, Gao Qingkui, Cheng Yanqiu, Wu Fuqin, and the late Jiu Zhenfeng, etc. Students who became very popular after coming to Shanghai include Song Dezhu, Zhao Jinrong, and Hou Yulan. (Wu Suqiu was a student of the school, but later left the school for some reason and became a student of Xiao Yun). Others who often perform in Peking include He Laosheng, Wang Helin, Li Hezeng, female impersonator Bai Yuwei, Li Yuru, Deng Deqin, martial arts actor Chuan Dewei, He Deliang, civilian and military Laosheng Wang Jinlu, and martial arts actress Li Jinhong, etc. The classes are divided into "De," "He," "Jin," and "Yu" four classes. Although it has only been established for a few years, due to its outstanding achievements and the emergence of talented people, it is gradually competing with the Fu Liancheng Society.</p>
<p>The Rongchun Society is the last of the three troupes to be established. It is organized by Shang Xiaoyun, with Zhao Yankui planning everything, and the results are quite good. The teachers they hired include Li Hongchun, Jiang Miaoxiang, Sun Shengwen, Cai Ronggui, Jia Duocai, Wang Shaofang, and others. Now they have added Wang Yaoqing, Hao Shouchun, Shang Heyu, Guo Chunshan, and other veteran opera performers, presenting an increasingly prosperous situation. Among the students, Xiaoyun's son Changchun (learning martial arts) is the mainstay, and Laosheng Xu Rongkui, Qingyi Sun Ronghui, martial arts Huadan Jia Shouchun (talented), and Xiaochou Wang Yongchun are all outstanding talents. It is a pity that the society often arranges "Nineteen Heroes of Qingcheng," a type of supernatural and lantern opera, which is not advisable. Otherwise, it is not difficult to stand on a par with the Fu Society and the Opera School. The student classes are arranged in the order of the society name "Rong" and "Chun."</p>
<h3>A Small Contribution on Filming "Romance of the West Chamber" Reader's Opinion from Xiangqiu</h3>
<p>— Lin</p>
<p>I am a person who is busy with chores in the family all day long and has no free time at all. In addition, I also have some teaching duties at a certain vocational girls' school, so I am always busy and in a panic. I simply have no time to ask about entertainment.</p>
<p>But the day before yesterday, when I was reading the Shen Bao, I accidentally turned to the "Entertainment" section and read Mr. Shigong's "Blessing Literary Films." He said: "Recently, there has been a better change on the silver screen," that is, changing from the tiresome "folk tales" to the production of "literary films." This cannot help but make people feel excited! He also said that the first one to be filmed is "Romance of the West Chamber; also saying: "It will be filmed as a song film." Because of these two goals, I was inspired to offer the following opinions.</p>
<p>I think: "The West Chamber" is originally a legendary genre, that is, composed of "lyrics" and "dialogue" interspersed together. It can be sung by filling in a palace score for that "lyric." This is the "Kunqu Opera" that has now become extinct.</p>
<p>Speaking of Kunqu Opera, on the one hand, it can be "sung," and on the other hand, it can be staged. Therefore, just looking at its "lyrics," although it is slightly profound and seems difficult for the general public to understand, it can still allow people to fully understand the plot on the stage or silver screen. And also can be understood from appreciate the plot to "lyric" of the major purpose! So it may not be "appreciated by both refined and popular tastes."</p>
<p>So I think, since "it is going to be filmed as a song film," then instead of making "lyrics" early, it is better to directly adopt its existing "music score"! In this way, the audience can refresh their eyes and ears, and culture can be used to promote China's inherent culture.</p>
<p>Speaking of materials, there are no less than several kinds of "West Chamber," all of which can be used for reference. In addition, such as "Zhui Bai Qiu," "Na Shu Ying"... etc., either have "dialogue" without "score," or have "score" without dialogue, one is convenient for "acting," and the other is convenient for "singing." If it is necessary to have both "score" and "dialogue," then there are "Jicheng," "Liu Ye," "E Yun Ge," as well as "Kunqu Opera Essence," "Kunqu Opera Complete Collection"... etc. It is a pity that the sets are incomplete, only a few excerpts are recorded, and each is different, but they can be taken for reference.</p>
<p>Speaking of instructing on lyrics and "stage" advisors, in addition to the "Xianni Society" that performed at the "Great World" and "Datian World" before, the "Datong Music Association" can also be asked to discuss it, or they may get more help.</p>
<p>Because I saw that the "silver screen business," which is related to social customs, has a tendency to "change," I wrote this article to make a proposal because of my excitement. I also hope that the wise men in the literary world and the celebrities in the art world will not hesitate to give advice!</p>
<p>Theater News: Famous martial arts actress Yan Shishan has been well received by Shanghai people since she performed Shi Xin this spring. From spring to summer, she continued for three months, and only stopped performing at the end of June, returning north with honor. After only five months, she will now respond to Huang Jin's invitation at the end of autumn and the beginning of winter, and will set off south tomorrow or the day after tomorrow with Ye Shengzhang and others.</p>
<h3>When Will You Return? — A Sound That Has Become Extinct</h3>
<p>The War of Resistance has entered its fourth year, and the decadent song "When Will You Return?" is still popular among young men and women. Its consciousness is distorted and its tone is close to depravity. In view of this, the Chongqing Central Propaganda Department yesterday sent a letter to the Ministry of Interior and the Central Library Review Committee for their information. At the same time, it also ordered all provinces and cities to investigate and prohibit it. From now on, the sound of "When Will You Return?" will become a feast. Note: This song is most popular in Shanghai.</p>
<p>(2) Sun Jinglu</p>
<p>Sun Jinglu is a newcomer who emerged in the art world in 1940. Now she is the mainstay of the Zhonglu Troupe and a basic actor of the Jin Xing Film Company. She has become the luckiest and most famous person on the drama stage and on the screen.</p>
<p>I saw her play Jinzi in the play "Wilderness" at the Xuan Palace Theater. Her stage style is very similar to Tang Ruoqing. Her acting skills are so refined, and her Mandarin is so fluent. She grew up in Peking since she was a child, so it is not surprising that her Mandarin is fluent, but her native place is actually Shanghai, which I am afraid few people know.</p>
<p>Hankou, this is Sun Jinglu's third hometown. When the Zhonglu Troupe was performing in Hankou during the war, she was only studying at the Yixun Girls' School in Hankou. Due to interest, she joined the Zhonglu's ranks. When Zhonglu arrived in Hong Kong, she had become one of the main actors, but unfortunately, internal strife suddenly occurred within Zhonglu. She and Jiang Qing and others withdrew at the same time and joined the Chinese Art Troupe led by Ouyang Yuqian. This troupe disbanded shortly after, so she drifted to her first hometown - Shanghai.</p>
<p>After coming to Shanghai, she continued to work hard for the drama movement. At first, she joined the Lafei Troupe for performances. Later, Tang Huaiqiu came to Shanghai, and the Zhonglu Troupe was revived. At Tang Huaiqiu's invitation, she returned to Zhonglu. Because Tang Ruoqing rarely took the stage, she was relied upon as the only mainstay of Zhonglu. She has only participated in the drama movement for a short period of three years, but she has already fulfilled her initial wish and become a successful person on the drama stage.</p>
<p>Jin Xing produced "The Family of Qinhuai," and Sun Jinglu performed as a guest actor in the film, playing the role of A Jin. For her, it was just an attempt, but after the film was released to the public, because of her superb acting skills, everyone unanimously praised her as a success! The Jin Xing authorities were in need of manpower, so they quickly sought her consent and signed a one-year contract.</p>
<p>Now, Sun Jinglu is just an eighteen-year-old girl.</p>
