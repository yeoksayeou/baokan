<h3 id="c11">上海當前之食住問題 <a href="#c11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>上海居民最感嚴重之兩大問題，爲食與住。食以米爲主，是爲大衆最所焦慮：蓋粳米已出百圓，洋米亦至八十餘圓；八口之家，月入數十金者，顯然無法果腹矣。時人議論紛紜，辦法不一端，無論其爲集團購米　爲消費合作，爲公儲，爲公賣、凡事實際工作，無不各有其相當功用；然離所謂上海市之民食問題者，其解決猶遠。如集團購米，受惠者有人，但非一般人俱得受惠機會。如消費合作，理論最長；誠能號召有衆，一體加入。集資直接購米，分配社員，以免米商居間盤剝，事屬甚善，茲且已有食糧合作協會之組織，以期普及：但宏來事功，有待事實爲證。至於公儲，原以爲備荒計；分投認購，又爲便於集事計，惟其如何購儲，庶不使日益昂貴之米糧，不增加其困難；以及將來如何分配，而實惠晋及於食戶，此一問題亦至難言；蓋如師常平之遺意，以資調劑，則出糶之方式大費研究，吾則仍將不免爲中間商所漁利。以言公賣，本爲素來談民食問題者所樂道，然必有强有力之執行機關，且有統一之辦法，充實之準備，吾則倉卒舉辦，誠恐商販裹足。糧商歇業，事朱成而害已著，非所以爲目前民食計也。竊以爲今日上海民食問題之大患，不患理論之不中聽，而患缺乏實心實力爲民食作整個之計畫，負執行之責任。以言米糧之來源，洋米固未嘗中斷，若欲以內地產米解除上海米糧之恐慌，則處今日之環境中，雖非絕對無望，而其希望實至有限。故目前治標之辦法，既不能用公家力量、負起民食責任；仍不能不有賴於商家之販運。商人所重在利，利之所在，不憚艱險，不避　近，而爭趨之；自亦未始不可利用其一念，稍增糧食之供給；然正亦以其利用時機，作過分之掠奪，重增民食以負擔。故富務之急，要在如何去其泰甚，糾正其失，防杜操縱，澄淸市面，使在正軌中活動，如是而有漲跌，不失爲事理之所應有。另一方面，應由兩租界如何籌謀合組一管理糧食機關，就整個糧食　予事權通盤籌劃，標本兼施，以應付當前之恐慌。吾則米價一貴，言論龐雜，辦法紛陳，僅見其追隨於大漲特漲之後，無益實際，徒喚奈何，乃求小康之局面，其可得耶？</p>
<p>至於住。邇來若房租頂費小租，其暴漲情形，正亦與糧食相彷彿，法租界爲此問題，已有不動產租賃章程草案之宣露，公共租界亦有革除小租陋習之傳說；要之，皆爲市政富局注意市民生活之表示。本報曾於三個月前，就上海居住問題之嚴重性，陳其應有之權宜措施；今觀於不動產租賃章程草案，各方面之權利義務，能知兼顧。然於承租人當前之困苦，猶未深切注意及之；出租人儘可利用種種權力以增加承租人之租金；或撒銷租的，予承租人以威脅。邇來新舊房屋之出租，不但其租金高昂無比，而婪索小租。動輒數千金。頂讓房屋，索費之鉅，駭人聽聞、甚有超過房屋之造價者。試觀各里弄中絕難得見出租人召租之房屋，蓋有房屋收回自放、亦須回樣收取項費或小租矣。革除小租陋習，民國十七年已通令禁止，其時除絕少數洋商帳房尙有挾勢不顧法令　常收取外，而大多數業主則已放棄小租而改收押租矣。今則死灰復燃，變本加厲。誠爲一般安居之計。毋使房屋問題增加其嚴重性，則（一）除認爲實有危險暴發堪虞之房屋准許翻造外，其餘即使已屆翻造期限　仍准通融，暫緩翻造，俾出租人不得藉口翻造，爲增加房租小遂勒遷承租人之口實。（二）卽承租人如無積欠房租情事，無論有無契的仍得繼續承租，不得藉詞强增房租，逼令遷讓。（三）兩租界應採取同樣步驟，對於房屋租賃問題作有效之處理、以解決當前住居問題之困難；至於出租人利益之厚薄如何，目前應摒之考慮之外。</p>

<p>甘茂林接着說，「這或許僅是一種詭計，但是戈林昨天的演說，預言戰事將有重大開展，照他一貫的作風看來，似乎並不說謊。或者德軍總攻巳迫在眉睫了。」</p>
<p>他態度沉着，等候敵軍的打擊，使人見而安心，暗自誇獎他不啻又是一個鎭靜不驚的霞飛將軍。可是萊諾一的意見就不同了。</p>
<p>萊諾常問，「爲什麼要有兩個總司令呢？假使參謀長喬治將軍負責指揮軍隊，何不讓甘茂林去担任參謀長和國防部長呢？」</p>
<p>萊諾和甘茂林勢成水火，不僅是爲了他們兩人的個性不同，而是爲了兩種軍事學說的矛盾。戰事開始以來，甘茂林主張採取守勢，沉機觀度，待時而動，萊諾却以主張攻勢戰出名。</p>
<p>萊諾說，「一個祇守不攻的將領，必致無戰不敗。」</p>
<p>他本允許加緊領導戰爭而上台，當然不得小採取大刀闊斧的計劃。無如他的可能性實在有限得很。他從訪問倫敦之日起，就堅決主張英國應在挪威領海埋設水雷。後來他在外交部擋案中，翻出一個訂立英法協定雙方不得單獨媾和的建議。那是達拉第始終拒絕承認的，萊諾却把他舊事重提。旣而他又提出比國問題，主張不要等到比利時政府乞援，然後派兵，而當迫令比國表明態度。</p>
<p>他問比利時內閣，「你們是贊成我們呢，還是反對我們？假使你們是贊成我們的，當然趕快合作，加强兩國邊境的防務。假使你們反對我們呢…</p>
<p>甘茂林對此大不謂然，他說這種辦法，無異是爲淵驅魚，使比利時二十五師軍隊投向敵國。兩人衝突甚烈。若不是陸軍部長達拉第以去就力爭，萊諾早就在四月中。以喬治將軍替代甘茂林了。莢諾雖不敢輕賈此險，聽任達拉第去職，但他個人的地位，似已較前增强。英國在挪威領海的行動，及在那維克海戰勝利，法國人聞而雀躍，萊諾也就身價驟增了。</p>
<p>四月二十日，他在衆議院中宣稱，一敵軍運鐵的路綫，已經切實截斷了。」在幾天前，他僅以一票之多獲勝，這回竟得衆議院一致擁護。我聞訊頗覺寬慰，不料當夜遇到一位參議員吿訴我說，這是沒有什麼意思的。</p>
<p>他黯然的說道，「你還不知道議院的詭計。萊諾獲得一致擁護，是他的反對派竭力運動所致。假使他能獲得多數，那是他個人的勝利，但是全體一致却是表示愛國情殷，是爲國家着想，而不是爲他了。」</p>
<p>第二天我和萊諾本人會面。他正在外交部官邸中蹀　往來，兩隻手挿在衣袋裹，看見我來，便聲若洪鐘地先吿訴我他登台以後所發見的情形，不覺使我吃一大驚。</p>
<p>他說，一戰車僅存在紙面上。國內秩序更是紊亂不堪。陸軍需要正殷的大砲和機關槍，還在軍火庫裏藏着。德軍有兩百師，或者有兩百四十師，我軍却還不到一百師。達拉第因循句且，阻撓一切改進計劃，竟使政府也無能爲力了。」</p>
<p>我道，「雖是這樣，達拉第終是一個愛國人啊！他在無綫電中播音時，口若懸河，滔滔不絕，而且語語打入人心坎之中。」</p>
<p>萊諾道，「不錯，我相信他渴望法國戰勝，但他更渴望着我的失敗呢。」</p>
<p>這一句驚人的評語雖未必允當，却是由衷之言，兩人怨恨之深，已可概見一斑了。</p>

<p>日來米市，雖經公吿嚴厲取締非法賣買、無如一般投機商人、司空見慣、視若具文、陽逢陰違、公開與秘密孰分、昨目之米價、竟又超出三日上午市價、上引一元有奇、蓋此輩藉口西貢訂貨、無船可裝、及杳港禁米出口、作爲口實、大事操縱、果躉戶少數人之腹、陷數百萬人於絕境、故早市初開、卽見　亂現象、大戶與浮頭互相爭進、懷貨者獲漁人之利、喊聲狂跳、一路直上至收市遂吿超越三日之限盤、開一號西貢爲八十八元、中八十五元，二號八十一元半、决至七十九兀八角、火絞八十五元半、决至八十二元七角、二號暹邏七十九元八角至七十九元、小絞七十九元至七十八元八角、東京珀尖七十八元至七十六元七角、米　七十元八角至七十元、碎六十八元半至六十六元四角、蕪尖七十七元至七十六元、西貢一號原包英華司允以居奇而乏售開、二號原包開至丸十六元、十二月九十四元、小絞八十九元半、統比前日加起一元左右、英華司籌碼仍枯、成交祇四五百噸、而現貨在客囤競買之際、成交可達一萬五千包之譜、</p>
<p>厚薄粳等國米、來源續在停頓中、不過銷塲仍以價貴退縮、成交有限、故市面平平、崑山特粳斛見九十九元、大市九十七元二角、薄稻原包九十四五元、斛見九十一元至八十九元、</p>
<p>粳米、国糯來源旣已久斷、市存亦日在削薄之中、而適在出銷之令、　不敷分配、物稀爲貴、猛漲三五元、開溧元一百元、香港白元亦提二元左右、開八十七元至八十四元、</p>

<p>外匯昨日市況、滙豐掛牌、悉無上落、英華匯暗市、徘徊於美匯六元關口、濟勢尙多盤旋、蓋利空消良缺乏繼續發展、經營者觀望、而本市又有某種傳說、故投機家仍來購買、午前一度微軟、後市匯豐少有塞出、故見穩定、結果現貨近期無變、遠期稍形拔開、</p>
<p>投機商晨市收買</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條、近遠期均平、紐的銀價仍平、倫敦生金呆定、匯兌英對美滬等不更、美對英滬等亦平、中央掛牌各匯如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金三辦士八一二五、美匯六元、與上日晚收價相同、開後市面沉靜、外銀行先與有利做開本月份美匯六元、後交易甚少、供求平衡、九時半匯豐掛牌揭曉、悉無上落、白銀平　稅亦無增减、嗣因投機商忽來扒購、而略轉軟、計某美行暨麥加和售予本月份美匯六元、以至五元九六八七五、迨迄收盤·市面不變、故英金現貨吿三辦士七九六八七五、美滙五元九六八七五、比晨開價各長〇一五六二五、與〇三　二五、</p>
<p>匯豐竟有不少塞出</p>
<p>後巾平中帶硬、乃引人注　之滙豐、頗懷供意、曾賣予華行美匯不少，計本月份價六元、但遠期仍示緊俏、延至晚收、現貨與本月份英金吿三辦士七九六八七五美匯六元、下月份英金三辦士七八一二五、美滙五兀八六八七五、較隔咋收市價、現貨本月份俱平、喜愛月份軋爾〇一五六二五與〇三一二五、</p>

<p>咋日現金烚赤暗盤起伏較窄、多空按兵不動、蓋外匯少變化故也、大致略走上游、午盤金號錢兌業等買進、高達五千七百七十元、後市銀號證券幫搜入、父好至五千七百七十五元、惟晚風因匯市扳硬、終吿回挫、結果尙　漲十八元、收盤爲五千七百四十八元、全日交易殊旺、的七千餘兩、銀樓飾金終則勿動、關金等平、</p>
<p>烚赤略走上游</p>
<p>晨初難聞外匯平靜、而檯面尙有買戶、開盤做高十元、計銀號進錢兌業二十兩、五千七百叫十元、未幾續入錢兌業三十兩、五千七百五十元、時金銀號稍有埕出、回跌十餘元、計金號出錢兌業　十兩、五千七百三十五元、但不久金號錢兌業均有吃進、價極堅穩、銀號對做三十兩、升達五千七百六十元、惟證券帮售予金號廿兩、微低十元、爲五千七百五十元、卒因匯市轉　、　有隱的之利多空氣、進戶殷切、價再向上、計銀號人金號三十兩、吿五千七百七十元、延至午收、銀號賣予證券幫三十兩、五千七百六十四元、午後開出人心甚昂、銀號對做一十兩、爲五千七百六十元、銀號證券幫搜購下、提升至五千七百七十五元、計金號進證券幫三十兩是也、後聞外滙硬化、搶帽子之夥來市賣出、又另一銀號亦塞、壓低三十餘元、計銀號出錢兌業二十兩、五千七百四十元、晚風得以守住、吿五千七百四十八元收盤、比上日軋漲十八元、全日上落四十元、現金號之本牌金售價、較烚赤高十數元、收進低三十元、現標金照掛牌金低五六十元、均無做、</p>

<p>證券暗盤、昨市因銀錢業有領券現貨交出爲數較鉅、並引起一般浮戶出籠、市價因此不振、一律回小、同時吃戶不甚踴躍、而未能均衡、人心爲此亦稍見疲軟、昨日經過、上午聯和買進極爲踴躍、爲數的五六十萬、恒康怡泰亦有相當需要、餘如仁昌及十六號均有買進、而聯益信孚生大潤利先後賣出、以聯益爲熱鬧、可謂勢均力敵、午收略小二三角、午後聯益價孚生大潤利繼續賣出、而吃戶漸稀、中一賣出亦湧、十六號及聯和稍有吐出、吃戶協興源順昌仁昌恒孚久豐怡秦爲數不湧、市價繼續趨疲、而戊種爲堅、結果一致回小一二角至八角、成交的二百三四十萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>

<p>股票交易、成交漢冶萍公司股五百股、價爲三元五角、</p>
<p>又衆業公所股市、晨初頗形寗靜、因本週交易淸淡多空雙方俱乏大量頭寸需要軋直也、但近收盤時賣風倐盛、久股下降極速、大都低至最近罕見水準、捨許多未證實之謠言外、無法推求此種跌風之理由、</p>
<p>英商上海毛羢召募新股事已詳本報、此决公開募集超過四十倍以上、（昨報漏去「十」字遂爲四倍致小標題亦犯同樣之誤）、其分配辦法、利安洋行昨已公佈、計申請認購五百股者派十五股一千股者派廿五股、一千五白股者派四十股、二千股者派五十五股、三千股者派八十五股、上項股票衆業公所定下星期開拍云、（茂）</p>

<p>滬埠外棉交易、日來父漸見活躍、但限於　織維者、中日廠俱見購買、同業開心思亦趨濃厚、故交易不少、然售價確未能好也、</p>

<p>昨日期貨生油交易、仍形暢旺良以一般米蠹投機米市、已獲如願以償、頗思在油市亦顯神通、故展開後繼續猛吸橫抬市價轉瞬又見激漲二元左右、詎知事有不如人意、午後突有某日商洋行兜售鉅量連油、因此市塲人心頓吿轉變、拋空戶大爲振奮、賣風打破買氣、市情急遽回瀉、結果期貨反跌、現貨稍有軒輊、大致與上日無大榮辱、統市做開十二月下期交靑島生油　三千桶、二月份交者亦有近千桶、現貨計成交大連豆油五十桶、大有廠豆油二百担、膠州生油二百件、烟台生油一百五十件、靑島生油廿桶、</p>

<p>海蜇以陳貨爲上品、人口鬆脆、風味絕佳、查本年產量減色而陳貨竟已斷檔、故新貴售價又　上升、刻市蜇皮爲一百十五元、蜇頭八十五元、比前漲起五元、</p>

<p>淡菜如甬產者、到貨時斷、上檔允感缺乏、故三四貢已遞升至四百四十元、寗子淡為四百十元、北路銷胃居多、元淡三百九十元、比諸前市須挺五六十碼之譜、其他舶來品、暹羅小淡售一百八十元、中淡一百九十元、大淡二百元、出辦二百二十元、查最近亦須好起十元、</p>

<p>扎鐵絲最近交易不暢、因外埠客商如天津·烟台·靑　·秦皇鳥·等幫、去路不動、僅靠本街鐵工廠建築幫之微量納胃、故實銷實屬有限、行情因之平定、未見高昇、昨每擔售五十二元、查成交二百餘擔左有、</p>

<h3 id="c88">托兒所的需要 <a href="#c88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>慕貞</p>
<p>過高等敎育的女子，在未婚之前，總希望在婚後仍能繼續到社會上去工作。然而事實却往往會使她們失望。一有了孩子，家裏照料乏人。孩子委諸傭人吧？實在有點不放心。因爲傭人大都是沒有受渦敎育的，管理孩子當然是有許多不合理的地方。不交給傭人管理吧，那又怎麼辦？孩子到底是自己的。將孩子送到幼稚園裏去，而幼稚園的下課時肌太早，與辦公時間不符。况日幼稚園的通例，未滿四歲的孩子是不招收的。這麼一來，未滿四歲的孩子又怎樣處理呢？這眞是今日婦女們的一個大問題——尤其對於靠經濟合作而組織家庭的婦女。</p>
<p>有許多受過高等敎育的大學女生，學識豐富，竟爲了孩子而將她們十多年的敎育埋藏在一個小小的範圍裏——一個家庭——盡她的天職，不錯，她們對於賢妻良母之責已盡厥職了，然而到底都是在小圈子裏打轉，對豐富的學問未免有點可惜！如今要爲服務社會的婦女們解決安置孩子的問題，我們還是少不了托兒所。托兒所能給予兒童以適宜的保養，自然的發展。如是，才能使服務社會的婦女們安心在她的　業上工作，而孩子方面亦得到他們合理的養育所。</p>
<p>以前上海也有托兒所設立，不過規橫很小，組織不完備，以致一般父母們很不放心。可是要設辦一間較妥善的托兒所也非有巨資不可。因爲托兒所並不是營業化的機關，而是爲大衆謀福利的機關；此外，人力的經營也有同樣重要。所以我最後還望社會人士合力集資經營，爲人羣謀福利——爲服務社會的婦女們解決安置孩子的問題，同時爲孩子們求得良善合理的養托所。</p>
<p>編者按：以前本欄在討論婦女出路問題的時候，有許多作者曾經提出過托兒所的需要來；要解决職業婦女的內顧之憂，這自是一件不可不注意的事。最近據說女靑年會正在積極籌設托兒所兩處，這實在是一個好消息。聽說明天（十二月八日）上午十時至下午六時在慕爾鳴路三二三號（靜安寺路口）該會舉行的義賣，目的就是要籌募托兒所的經費。我們希望熱心的士女們，努力帮助她們，以促此事之成功。</p>

<h3 id="c89">女挑伕 <a href="#c89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>— 亦耐</p>
<p>去年的秋天，我從上海動身到韶關去。當我路渦香港九龍而到達廣東邊緣的沙魚涌時，我不禁對廣東婦女發生一種很新奇而深刻的印象，因爲在沙魚涌與淡水之間的一條路上，沿途我看到了整千整萬，排成行列的挑伕，挑着自香港運進的一大箱，一大箱的火油，香烟，火柴。種種商品和由內地輸出的紙，茶，香菇之類的土貨。這些來來往往的挑伕之中，婦女却佔了大半數。我再從淡水乘轎到惠陽，站在惠陽的江邊候船到老隆的當兒，那拿着扁担，熙熙攘攘，爭前恐後，像螞蟻一樣的往船上擠，而且挑的苦力們也還是婦女佔三分之二。其中有老至四五十歲的，有小至十五六歲的。一律光着大脚鴨子，頭上裏着方塊布，皮膚黑中帶黃，身腰長得那麼挺直，扛了百斤重的箱籮行李，走起來比那些徒手的老爺少爺們還快。而且任夕陽西下，她們高與時，也許還會唱起山歌來。這時你在後面，望着那强壯康健的背影，聽着那淸脆嘹亮的歌聲，在紅雲滿天霞的山邊水旁，展開在你眼前的是一幅美麗的畫面，畫面裏的人也是美麗的。這時候，你呀，說不定會把留在你腦海裏一位燙髮穿高跟鞋的愛人暫時忘得一乾二凈！</p>
<p>這些女挑伕有的寄靠挑擔爲生的，有的祗是把它當做副業，目的在賺些外快貼補家用。至於她們勞力的代價却非常的低廉。在戰前的時候，一擔行李從碼頭挑到旅館，祇要一毫子（不及國幣一角）。自從戰事發生後，一則因爲物價高漲，二則因爲到內地旅客的增加，她們的索價也就漸漸的提高了。每挑擔需要國幣一角至叫角。長途挑擔，按里計算，每里五角。據說，一個挑伕，平均每天可賺上一塊半錢，因爲她們每天可走上七八十里路，但這種生意不是天天有的，何　她們除了挑擔工作，還要負着家裏其他一切勞力工作和撫育子女呢！她們之中有的已死了男人，有的男人收入不多，有的男人已出外洋，所以她們的收入幾乎全部拿回養家，在道米價高漲到七八十元的今天，生活的刻苦是可想而知了。</p>
<p>這些女挑佚不僅氣力大，而且膽量也不小。前綫的挑擔工作也多出她們執行。在工作很緊張的當兒，她們的草笠的闊邊上有時也會中上一兩粒的子彈，可是，她們的態度却很鎭靜。子彈在她們看來就像小石子一樣的不足重視。從她們的工作成績和她們那大而靈活的眸子裏，我們也可知道她們不僅力大膽壯，而且天分也不低，可惜的是沒有受敎育的機會，幾乎十分之十都是目不識丁，所以她們終年就像牛馬一般的勞働，牛馬一般的生活着。</p>
<p>看了廣東的女挑佚，不禁使我想到女子職業問題。在都市裏，現在不是還有一些老爺少爺們在反對女子職業嗎？甚至去年郵政局還鬧過一决不招考女職員的風波　他們所持的理由當然還是不外乎男治外女治內的原理。，可是，這些女挑伕却能自山自在的在鄉村裏以擔挑爲職業，沒有人反對她們，這是什麼原因呢？在這裏祇好留待老爺少爺們自己來答覆了。</p>

<p>垂虹亭是松陵東門外的名勝，每當春日，好景如畫，隄岸上柳浪風翻，如烟如霧，和春水綠波相映着，上下一碧又有紅的夭桃，白的嬌李，點染其間，祇覺得絢爛穠艷，好似天公故意施展他造化的能力，發展着春之美，在大地上繡出這明媚景象，給一般愛惜春景的士女們去遊目騁懷，怡情悅性。便是一般林間小鳥也是飛上飛下，嚶鳴不已，歌頌着大地春色。這大日已過午，河上有一畫舫，桂棹蘭槳，在綠波中輕泛着。舟子點着篙，船娘搖着櫓，臉上都露出欣欣之色。頭艙中兩邊排着玲瓏小巧的檳木椅千，上面也坐着幾個婦女和小厮，正緊瞧着中艙裹的人，似乎在伺候他們。而中艙裏坐着幾個男女，正在笑逐顏開的飲酒賦詩。正中坐一個儒巾儒服五旬以上的文人，頷下有些短髭，神彩很是俊逸，手搖泥金紙蹙，滿面春風。在他左右侍坐着一對姊妹花，左首一個女子年可十八九，風　霧鬢，明眸皓齒，生得一張鵝蛋臉，十分勻凈，兩頰如桃花灼灼，光澤照人。身衣淡紅衫子，　彎　小，腰支婀娜，活似畫圖中人。右首坐一個尙在雛齡，然而也生得眉似春山，眼如秋波，滿露着婉媚靈慧，絕不庸俗。桌上放着許多美酒佳肴。那止中坐的儒生，一手摸着短髭，一手搖着摺扇，對二人帶笑說道：「古人云：不作無益之事，何以遺有涯之生？我隱居在此鄉間，花鳥悅性，絲竹陶情，嫩得再向仕途中去厮混。人生百年耳，需富貴何時？我何必去和牛驥同皂，雞鶩爭食呢？世問最可貴的是英雄名士和美人。我自知雖然沒有王佐之才，而一枝筆却不輸於古時夢筆生花的江郞。這幾年來，息影之餘，惟有吟咏自遺，雖不能如輞川之樂，而自知松陵名士，舍我其誰？所可喜的，有你們多才美貌，綠意紅情的柳氏雙姝，常在我身側，嬌憨伶慧，如小鳥依人，無異解語之花，忘憂之草。使我一見到你們的嬌顏，一切愁懷，立刻化爲烏有了。料想當年江東二喬，扣不能擅天於先。可謂絕世美人，這又豈是偶然的事呢？」年幼的聽了，格格地笑道：「我們都是庸劣之資，幸逢張相公不棄微賤，敎我們念書寫字，作詩文，道樣好的先生，眞是難得。」儒生笑道：「絳子，你這小妮子年紀雖輕，而很知用功，雖不及你姊姊工書養詩，但也是個可造之材，他日未可限量。待我物色一位佳公子和你做媒，好嗎？」說罷，哈哈大笑，露出很得意的樣子。（二）</p>

<h3 id="c93">偉人「安迪生」本事 <a href="#c93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>— 保羅</p>
<p>湯姆·安迪生，在困苦中過了他的幼年時代，就走進　壯年的階段，然而困難和障礙，仍舊沒有與他脫離關係，當他離開巴士頓到達紐的的時候，他正感受着破產的痛苦，在並不挺刮的衣衫之間，挾着一包書籍，甚至會引起警察的疑慮而開槍警吿。</p>
<p>他到達紐的，是到倍·愛爾斯叔叔那裏去做工，不過他並不是一個洗掃辦公室的人才，所以一有機會，就拿起他心愛的書本研讀，抽着空就去作電學的試騐。</p>
<p>他一心一意要去見金價指示局局長泰茄德先生，屢决受到擋駕的難堪，機會終於在一天降臨了，正在金價漲落的時候，那隻機器却無巧不巧地損壞了，在沒有人可以修埋而正在萬急的時候，安迪生挺身而出，立刻把那隻機器修好，在與秦茄德和包惠爾將軍的會見之中，他得到了他們的同意，去着手製造一架更完美的金價報導機。</p>
<p>第一天上工，可巧遇着大風雨，在他到達西方聯合工廠的門前，碰着了一個美麗的少女—瑪麗·史蒂惠爾小姐。她的傘被安迪生弄得翻了一個面，所以他第一件工作，就是那雨傘的修理。</p>
<p>因爲那少女的工作塲所，就在安迪生的工塲的樓上，她是在凱士東氏電訊鏈盤製造廠裏服務的，懂得摩斯電碼。當他修好了傘去送還原主的時候，他不禁印進了她的美麗而可愛的影子，不過他囊無分文，所以不能接受她一同出去用膳的要求。然而結果竟會在一個飯店中相遇，安迪生只吃了一個蘋菓餅和一杯鮮牛奶，但瑪麗在吃了一個全餐，因此安迪生袋裏僅有的一個角幣是不能應付飯帳了，幸虧瑪麗的隨機　變，從錢袋中丟出了一個金元，假裝是安迪生落下的。這一筆小小的借款，當安迪生領到了第一個月的薪俸時，就去歸還，此後他們就互相來往，彼此的愛情，就在逐漸的滋長。</p>
<p>日以夜繼的努力，各個工友的合作，那架埋想的機器，終於是成功了。安迪生得到了四萬元的酬報。他回到工　，就用他日常用慣的一個鐵管，發出了摩斯電報給他的情人，那個電報的富有爆炸性，使同事們屏息的靜聽着。</p>
<p>「四萬元，我要自已設廠。」</p>
<p>那回雷說：「我知道你會這樣的，湯姆。」想不到接着他就會發出「你肯嫁給我嗎？」的電碼，而那回音並不出乎意料，於是一對合作的男女，在許多同事之前，擁抱起來了。</p>
<p>門羅公園鎭的試騐所，接着就創設起來，安迪生也在工作之暇，享受優美的家庭生活。在他的試騐室裏，發明了一千多種東西，不過他也曾經過幾决瀕於破產的急難。在無可奈何時，他只得鎭進了一個躱藏的地方。</p>
<p>在電燈泡發明之前，正當經濟窘迫，甚至於將全部的工友辭去，不過他們仍舊願意工作，在無意中使他得到了製造留聲機的啟示。在某一天的晚上，他的聲音從蠟盤裏放出來了。</p>
<p>在安迪生各種發明之中，電燈泡是最偉大的一種，所費的時間和精力也最多，所遭受的失敗的决數也最多。結果他果然成功了。那第一隻燈泡，繼續燃點了四十小時，許多工友興奮地守候着，看那世界上從未有過的光明。</p>
<p>困難還沒有完全克制，秦茄德更是一個有力的反對者，因爲他擁有許多煤氣的股票，不過事情無論怎樣困難，憑着堅强的毅力，終究　够成功的，安迪生也就在六個月的限定時間中舖設紐的全城的電綫，並且設置一個完美的發電廠。在臨近開燈儀式之前，還遇到　件損壞的意外，結果在一八八二年九月四日星期一的下午三時，光明照耀着紐約全市。泰茄德先生的臉，也被一個過分興奮者敲了一下，給用帽子蓋住了。</p>

<p>— 居滋春</p>
<p>我覺得很幸運，我居然能够從銀幕上看到了大發明家安迪生的幼年生活。</p>
<p>安迪生生長在一個經濟並不富裕的家庭裏。他雖然有一位慈愛的母親和一個活潑可愛的妹妹和他表同情，但他的父親是那麼粗暴，嚴厲。爲了他很喜將化學藥品拿來做玩意兒，所以時常闖了禍；事情被　父親知道，不是受打便是一頓痛責。後來，竟爲鬧禍而被學校開除了。之後，父親更恨他，沒有給他錢買書，也不送他進學校，可是，愛迪生却並不失望，他放大了膽和環境掙扎，他靠了自己的努力，終於得到了火車站長的允許，在車上一塊小小的地方幹他的發報事業了。</p>
<p>安迪生　奮地工作着，他把一段段親聞抄錄編排好，很快的印成報紙出售，銷路倒也不差，他因此賺得了些錢，他把這些從辛勤獲得的報酬，去買了書來讀。所以，每經一次春花秋風，每過一個長夏嚴冬，他的書架上是準會添上幾冊新書的。他雖然不能進學校念書，可是這並不磨滅了他的動讀精神。</p>
<p>安迪生一面做報販，一面却照舊　他的實騐工作，有一决他配成一種炸藥，險些在車中閙了大火，車長憤恨之餘，將他所有的藥物都丟了，並且還請他吃了一記耳光，把他趕下車來。</p>
<p>可憐迄一回安迪生又失敗了，他所最心愛的藥品給人丟掉了，他的耳朶給人打聾了，他是陷在一個困苦的環境裏面了，人們沒有給他同情憐憫，相反地，一批批的諷刺與嘲笑，冷箭似的毫不留情的向他投擲。然　我們這位大發明家呢，却絲毫不氣餒，不心灰，依奮向前奮鬥。越是環境困苦，越是堅定了他的心志，使他更奮發，帶着快樂的心去完成他的願望。</p>
<p>「幼年安迪生」實在太使我感動了。它不但逗我流了同情的眼淚，它還給了我勇氣和熱血，我深深地感覺到：我們要從一個惡劣的周圍裏打出一條光明的路來，我們一定會遭受到許多决的折磨的。我們要打破難關，全賴自己努力。我們要有上進的決心和奮鬥的精神。事情失敗了，不徒然悲傷，也不灰心沮喪，我們要繼續堅毅地和環境奮鬥，那麼成功往往就跟在失敗的後面。其决，我們還要有一個熱烈的希望和一個快樂的心境，沒有希望，根本便不會努力；沒有快樂，我們便不能去創造一切。</p>
<p>當我在電燈光下寫文的時候，不禁懷想起這位大發明家給我們的賜予；他的成功，使全人類的生活改觀了。但是，我們別忘了這位大發明家是從困苦中磨鍊出來的。我們今天來紀念他，最要緊的，還是我們應該向他學習自强不自的精神，努力去創　福國利羣的偉業！</p>

<p>— 徐百益</p>
<p>「幼年安迪生」徵文的獎品，雖然具有深重的意義，但決不能說是十分豐厚，而耍在幾千個人中當選在十名以內的確是一件困難的事，然而申報讀者中終究不乏勇敢的靑年男女和現代父母，毅然而踴躍地來參加這一决競賽，這種勇氣和精神，是十分可敬的；同時　說明了這一决的競賽，對於社會上所發生的　良的影響。</p>
<p>應徵的文稿，總共收到四千五百四十三件，其中父母之部有二千二百三十二件，因爲必須先看影片，然後方能寫作，在這樣一個無形而叉無可避免的限制之下，有這樣的成統，已經是很成功了。</p>
<p>安迪生的幼年，的確是可歌可頌的，如果沒有他幼年時的種種遭遇，他決不能忍受成年時的屢决失敗；如果沒有他幼年時所養成的毅力，決不會產生他成年時的豐富成就。</p>
<p>從應徵文稿之中，我曾經體騐到眞情的流露，熱血的沸滕，心靈的感應：觀察到秀麗的文筆，眞摯的辭句，堅確的意志。　經懶惰的靑年們，懊悔他們的已往，開始今後的努力；嚴父們鄙視他們的面具，露出可愛的笑容；慈母們慶幸她們的摯愛，堅定不移的信念；而一般人都認爲「幼年安迪生」是一部優美的作品，對於社會有極大的影響，而寄予中國電影界以殷切的期望。</p>
<p>無疑地，每一個應　者，曾經同情於安迪生幼年的境遇而流過熱淚，深切的印象，在每一個人的人生旅途上，無異是一塊値得紀念的哩程碑。眼看着一大堆的信件，正像　　着一大羣有希望的靑年，得到了正確的啟示而向着光明的前途進發，能不使人興奮與感動！</p>
<p>大體上，每一篇應徵的文稿，都是優秀的，然而爲了獎額的限制，不得不賽行一番挑選的工作。不過得獎者固然値得欣喜，落選者也不必失望，其實具有安迪生精神的靑年，當小認識失望這二個字。因爲這一次微文的最大動機，是安迪生精神的發揚和光大，使現代的靑年，作爲自身修養的根據，服務社會的基本，使現代父母採取正當的方法，扶育國家的英才。獎品之設，無非是助興市已。</p>
<p>假使安迪生氏仍在人世，他一定會贊許這一决的徵文。</p>

<p>— 黃子祥</p>
<p>很久不跑電影院了。這决是芬請客，她預先買好了票子，使我有機會得上壯麗宏偉的大華去看了「幼年安迪生」。</p>
<p>同出來時，芬伴我走，沿着靜安寺路朝西。</p>
<p>「祥，你是湯姆，我是妲妮，我們大家一條路。」</p>
<p>「眞的麼？我配麼？—偉大的安迪生，我只配崇拜他。」</p>
<p>「不是麼—安迪生在路上向他的妹妹說，他要做華盛頓和富蘭克林？你從前不是也向我說過麼？祥，我看你近來似乎有些頹唐，所以特地請你看這張片子。「舜人也，我亦人也；」安迪生固然値得我們崇拜，但更値得我們效法。老實說，他當時的環境並不比你現在好一些：他被學校開除，被父親責打，被全鎭的人訕笑和虐待，甚至被認爲神　錯亂，舉止失常—是一個瘋子。然而他雖然精神上感到嚴重的苦痛，却還是處處追求着智識，去滿足他的天生的好奇心。他堅決地和環境奮鬥着，不惜做苦工，當小販，——當我看到他一面曲　奉承，給火車裏的客人點烟送報，一面把書一本一本地買進來時，我感動得流下淚來。」</p>
<p>「是的，我也流了淚。我的幾本舊書和翻版書幾乎也是這樣買進來的。」</p>
<p>「正是啊，所以我說你是湯姆呀，雖然你所歡喜的是文學。再說，我學得安迪牛的所以能够成功爲有功於人類文化的大科學家，並不完全由於他好奇心重，思想靈敏，大部份倒是由於他那廣礡的人類愛。人家對他是輕唬，是訕笑，是毆打，而他回答人家的總是忠誠的服務和一片純潔無邪的愛。當車站的電報員嫌他好動，把他逐走的時候，他却冒了自已的牛命危險，從火車底下救了那當報員負責照顧的一個女孩子。當南北戰爭爆發的時候，他出報紙支持爲正義作戰的林肯。當全鎭的入拒絕給他工作，反而笑他，罵他的時候，他却自吿奮勇，利用火車的汽笛，救了一火車勢將遇難的乘客，其中大部份是笑他，罵他的人的親友眷屬。沒有這種以德報怨的人類愛，世界上是不會有偉大的人物的。詳，你時常給我講托爾斯泰的小說，對於這一點你一定應該比我看得更透澈的。」</p>
<p>「哦—可是你却忘記了另外一點。」</p>
<p>「什麼？」芬疑視着我，脚步幾乎停了下來。</p>
<p>「安迪生的人類愛我以爲大部份是他母親給他的。如果沒有這位獨具慧眼的慈母，在他苦痛的時候給以安慰，在他絕望的時候給以鼓勵，我懷疑我們今日究竟有沒有福份享受這位大科學家的賜與。母愛是偉大的，是和大科學家的豐功偉業同樣偉大的。然而—」</p>
<p>「然而你沒　了母親，因此就覺得人牛冷落了麼？祥，我們　」</p>
<p>芬沒有說下去，眼圈兒可紅了。</p>
<p>這時我們已走到了西摩路口無軌電車站，大家站住了。我拉着芬的手，笑着熱烈地說：</p>
<p>「芬，別担心，我有一個妲妮也够了。我沒有動搖，我聽你的話，我要做湯姆。——謝謝你，請我看了這張片子—」</p>
<p>在興奮裏和芬吿別了。在車中，我陷於沉思。當那幅慈祥司敬的人　像映現在我的腦幕上時，我小由的拿下了頭上的帽子，同時耳際　乎聽得一陣熱烈的掌聲。</p>
<h3 id="c97">「幼年安迪生」徵文　父母之部第一名 <a href="#c97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>— 沈昭華</p>
<p>米高梅公可攝製的「幼年安迪牛」影片，給我們不少父母敎育的啟示。</p>
<p>第一：父母應該以兒童的興趣爲中心，儘量培植，展其所長。安迪生從小喜歡研究自然科學，他的父親雖然待他很嚴，但仍舊元許他在樓下的一　小室裏，放着許多瓶兒。罐兒·化學藥品。安迪生可以在道間房裹，專心地玩他所喜歡玩的科學把戲，不受大人的干涉。他後來對於人類的貢獻，未始不是發源於此。</p>
<p>其决，父母應該鼓勵兒童營獨立的生活。安迪生在十幾歲的時候，就離開家庭，獨自在火車上販賣報紙糖菓。他的父母，居然肯讓這一個幼年獨子，遠離膝下。這一點却很　得注意。我們不應該把子女當作私有物，永遠禁囿於家庭之內。相反地，我們應該培養兒童獨立的人格，使他們的興趣，逐漸向家庭以外發展。大起來能够獻身社會，不以離家爲苦。</p>
<p>第三：兒童在學校的成續，只能代表表面的評量。安迪生在學校裏，功課很壞。敎師甚至認他是不可造就。他的父親也因此非常失望。但是事實上，安迪生不但不像他老帥所說的愚笨，反而是個絕頂聰明的天才。可見得兒童在學校裏失敗，原因很多，愚笨並不是唯一的因素。所以，如果子女的成績不好，做父母的，不必灰心，更不必生氣。却應該進一步去研究成績何以不好的原因，再作適當的處置。</p>
<p>第四：要更改兒董的習慣，斥駡　不是有效的方法。安迪生喜歡把兩手挿在衣袋裏，他的父親却不喜這樣，因此屢决受到申斥。但是安迪生這個習慣，　終　不曾　去。在這裏，「幼年年安迪生」影片的導演，指出了一般父母　易犯加最無效的　種　病。</p>
<p>第五：兒童的思想，有時會比成我更精密，更合理。安迪生想出用鏡子反射增加光　的方法；他又想出利用汽笛拍發電報的方法。這都是當時成人所不能解決的問題。安迪生替許名見童　了一口氣。所以子女年齡　然幼稚，他們的意見，却値得尊重，不應漢視小顧。</p>
<p>第六：父母待子女，「慈」似乎比「嚴」更加重要。安迪生的父親，正是一個「嚴父」的典型。安迪生平時不敢用正眼看他的父親，也不敢在父親前多說一句話。後來甚至私自逃走。這是多麽的不幸。倘若他的父親能够用「慈母」的態度對待兒子，那末融融洩洩的家庭生活，不是更有味嗎？</p>

<h3 id="e1">New Developments in the International Situation: China Actively Prepares for General Offensive; Japan Reorganizes Army for a Desperate Southern Advance; Chinese Government Strengthening Political and Economic Institutions <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing: According to Chinese sources, the Sino-Japanese situation seems to be entering a temporary standstill, awaiting new developments in the international arena. The signing of the treaty by Japan has dispelled all hopes for peace talks between Japan and Chongqing. Although there have been repeated rumors of such talks in the past, it seems unlikely that anyone will pay attention to them in the future. Well-informed Chinese observers have expressed the opinion that when Konoe was determined to assume the premiership for the second time on July 17th of this year, his main task was to promote a peaceful resolution of the Sino-Japanese war. Therefore, Japan launched a peace offensive at one time, but it was resolutely rejected by Chongqing. Unable to reverse its hopeless situation, Japan signed a treaty with the Nanjing government on November 30th. This move was mainly aimed at coping with the domestic situation. Since Japan has failed to resolve the China situation, it will shift its entire attention to the south. According to estimates by a senior Chinese military authority, Japan will use ten divisions for this, and has already withdrawn troops from China for reorganization and training. Seven of these divisions have been reorganized and are currently undergoing three months of training under the guidance of German experts, focusing on blitzkrieg tactics. This training is expected to be completed by early January next year. At the same time, it is reported that two divisions will be concentrated in Hainan, and at least one division can be drawn from Taiwan. It is expected that Japan's first action will likely be launched in January, occupying Cam Ranh Bay (transliteration) in Vietnam and using it as an important base for military operations in the South China Sea. The main objective will be to attack Singapore. If ten divisions are deemed insufficient, Japan will continue to withdraw troops from China. Yichang and Nanchang may be included in the withdrawal. Therefore, while it is useful for the Japanese to use these two cities as offensive bases, their use is very limited if Japan decides to temporarily adopt a defensive posture in China. Furthermore, according to qualified sources, the Chinese people's fears about the possibility of various countries turning against China or exerting pressure to force it to accept Japanese peace terms have been completely dispelled since the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union successively guaranteed to continue their aid. Currently, all Chinese people firmly believe that it is impossible for Japan to conquer China. The current question is how long China still needs to wait before the Japanese army can completely withdraw and restore peace under conditions that China deems fair and honorable. China's task today is to strengthen its internal economic and political organization, and at the same time prepare for a general offensive when a large number of aircraft and heavy artillery are transported from the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, and when international and remote developments are favorable to the Chinese army's counterattack against Japan. At present, general impartial observers all acknowledge the magnitude and difficulty of the Chinese government's current tasks. According to Reuters, the government is currently planning to establish a powerful organization to fundamentally solve China's various economic problems and take a firm stand on internal political events. At the same time, China is actively preparing for a large-scale counteroffensive. (Reuters, 6th)</p>

<h3 id="e10">Fujian Provincial Government Affairs: Inspection Report <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Fuzhou: The Jiangxi-Hunan-Guangdong-Guangxi group of the Executive Yuan's Political Affairs Inspection Group, led by Jiang Tingfu, entered Fujian in June of this year for inspection. The report on Fujian Province has recently been released by the provincial government. The main points of its content are as follows: (1) Fujian Province is wealthier than Guizhou and Guangxi, but not as wealthy as Hunan, Zhejiang, and Guangdong. The rural economy has been improving since the war, but the people are mostly sick. Those suffering from malaria account for 30% to 40% each year, and plague is easy to spread. The national physique is very weak. (2) The provincial government is working hard to improve governance. In recent years, there have been several new administrative measures, such as requiring civil servants below the county level to be trained and guaranteed. County government personnel do not advance or retreat with the county magistrate. This system is a major reform in China's local administration. Therefore, the basic trend of the personnel system is very proper, but attention should be paid to the abuse of those being trained relying on legal protection and not cooperating effectively with the county magistrate, or forming their own systems, mutually supporting each other and excluding dissidents. (3) The grassroots organizations in Fujian Province are quite substantial. The county and district organizations are very large, and the position of the commissioner's office is not as good as in Jiangxi. In general, there are a large number of local administrative personnel, and their treatment is not low, but the level of general knowledge is very poor. (4) The provincial government is most active in promoting provincial administration. The provincial government trusts young people, and they should be energetic and conscientious in their work. Therefore, they are making every effort to recruit and train young cadres to strengthen grassroots organizations. Political progress depends on this. (5) What best demonstrates the proactivity of the provincial administration is its commercial policy. The provincial government adheres to one principle, that is, the standard for public commerce is that wholesale is handled by the government, and retail can be done by private individuals as much as possible. The provincial government believes that this method can eliminate the monopoly of large capital, and not compete with small people for profit. It can not only regulate materials and stabilize prices, but also absorb capital and carry out various construction projects. Judging from the theory, it is in line with the Three People's Principles of Sun Yat-sen and the current world trend. Its trade organizations are still sound, and the financial and fiscal aspects can also cooperate. This core test is of great significance and deserves attention. The central government should strengthen its maintenance in order to observe success. (6th)</p>

<h3 id="e11">Current Food and Housing Problems in Shanghai <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>The two major problems that Shanghai residents feel are most serious are food and housing. Food, with rice as the staple, is the greatest anxiety of the public: the japonica rice price has risen above one hundred yuan, and foreign rice has also reached eighty yuan; families of eight with monthly incomes of several tens of yuan are obviously unable to feed themselves. People are discussing and debating various methods, whether it be group rice purchases, consumer cooperation, public storage, or public sales. All practical work has its own considerable use; however, it is still far from solving the so-called food problem of Shanghai. For example, group rice purchases benefit some people, but not everyone has the opportunity to benefit. Consumer cooperation has the most convincing theory; if it can call on the public to join together, gather funds to directly purchase rice, and distribute it to members to avoid exploitation by rice merchants, it would be very good. There is already an organization of food cooperation associations in order to popularize it; however, great achievements depend on factual evidence. As for public storage, it was originally intended to prepare for famine; apportioning subscriptions is also to facilitate the gathering of things. How to purchase and store so that the increasingly expensive rice does not increase the difficulty; and how to distribute it in the future so that the benefits reach the eating households, this is also a difficult question to say; if it is to be like the late Shi Changping's intentions to use it for regulation, then the method of selling rice out requires a lot of research, and we will still inevitably be exploited by middlemen. As for public sales, it is favored by those who have always talked about the food problem, but it must have a strong and effective executive agency, and a unified method, and sufficient preparation. If we rashly organize it, I am afraid that merchants will be hesitant and close their businesses. If things become a disaster and the harm is already obvious, it is not a plan for the current food situation. I think that the greatest trouble with Shanghai's food problem today is not that the theory is not pleasing, but that there is a lack of genuine and practical strength to make a whole plan for the people's food and to take responsibility for implementation. Speaking of the source of rice, foreign rice has never been interrupted. If you want to relieve the panic of Shanghai's rice with rice produced in the interior, although it is not absolutely hopeless in today's environment, the hope is actually very limited. Therefore, the current temporary solution cannot use public power to take responsibility for the people's food; it still has to rely on merchants' transportation. What merchants value is profit. Where the profit is, they are not afraid of difficulties and dangers, and they do not avoid going to remote and near places, and compete to go there; they may also be able to use their single thought to slightly increase the supply of food; but it is also because they use the opportunity to make excessive plundering, greatly increasing the burden on the people's food. Therefore, the urgent task of the rich is how to remove their excesses, correct their mistakes, prevent manipulation, clarify the market, and allow them to operate in the right track. If there are ups and downs, it is not a matter of course. On the other hand, the two concessions should jointly plan to form a food management agency, to make overall plans for the entire food situation and give them the power to tackle both the symptoms and the root causes, in order to cope with the current panic. If rice prices are expensive, there are complex opinions and various methods, only seeing them follow after a big increase, which is useless and only crying out helplessly, how can a small well-off situation be obtained?</p>
<p>As for housing, the soaring situation of recent rents, transfer fees, and small rents is exactly the same as that of food. The French Concession has already revealed a draft of the real estate leasing regulations for this problem, and there is also a rumor of eliminating the bad habit of small rents in the Public Concession; in short, it is all an expression of the municipal government's attention to the lives of citizens. This newspaper had three months ago, on the severity of the housing problem in Shanghai, put forward its appropriate temporary measures; now, looking at the draft of the real estate leasing regulations, the rights and obligations of all parties can be taken into account. However, it has not paid close attention to the current difficulties of the lessee; the lessor can use various powers to increase the lessee's rent, or cancel the lease, to threaten the lessee. Recently, the renting of new and old houses is not only extremely expensive, but also greedy for small rents. Every turn costs thousands of gold. The cost of transferring houses is so huge that it is shocking, and some even exceed the cost of building the house. Try to look at the rented houses in the alleys, which are difficult to find. Houses that have been taken back and rented out also have to charge a fee or a small rent. The bad habit of eliminating small rents was banned in 1928. At that time, in addition to a very small number of foreign merchant accounting firms that still disregarded laws and regulations and often charged them, most landlords had already abandoned small rents and switched to collecting security deposits. Now, the ashes have rekindled, and it has become even worse. It is a general plan for peaceful residence. In order to prevent the housing problem from increasing its severity, (1) in addition to allowing houses that are actually dangerous and may erupt, the remaining houses, even if they have reached the expiration date for renovation, should still be allowed to be accommodated and postponed for renovation, so that the lessor cannot take the opportunity to renovate, in order to increase the rent. (2) Even if the lessee has no arrears in rent, whether or not there is a contract, they can continue to lease, and they must not force them to increase the rent or force them to move. (3) The two concessions should take the same steps to effectively handle the housing leasing problem in order to solve the current difficulty of housing. As for how thick or thin the lessor's interests are, they should be put aside for consideration at present.</p>

<p>Moscow: Soviet Ambassador to Japan Smetanin recently issued a statement to the Japanese government that the Soviet Union's China policy has not changed, which is the first important announcement on Sino-Soviet relations in four months. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov also made this announcement on August 1st of this year, saying that "Our relationship with the great China, which has survived since the war of resistance, is always harmonious and friendly based on the Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact." The new statement issued by the Soviet Union to Japan does not contain any intention to undermine recent efforts to restore normal Soviet-Japanese relations, but it is indeed a public confirmation of the Soviet Union's friendship towards the Chinese government under the leadership of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. Japan recently told the Soviet Union that the Japanese-Wang conditions were not aimed at the Soviet Union and did not hinder Japan's desire to adjust Soviet-Japanese relations. Soviet Ambassador to Japan Smetanin made the above statement on Wednesday. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<p>Washington: California Democratic Congressman Isaac told United Press reporters yesterday that the United States should ban the transportation of war necessities to Japan and hand over the items to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. If necessary, they should not even be charged. Congressman Isaac said, "This is a long-term method of economic assistance. If this can be done, we may be able to prevent Japan from continuing to advance south." He also advocated that in order to express America's opposition to Japan's actions, the U.S. government should send several warships to Singapore for a "friendly visit." He also said that he does not believe that the United States can use the port of Singapore as a long-term base, but he believes that if necessary, he supports taking this action. Congressman Isaac continued, "I feel that adopting British Trinidad as a naval base is the same in nature as adopting Singapore as a naval base. The President has the power to adopt any new location as an American naval base without consulting Congress." He also urged the government to provide new assistance to China and Britain. He said, "Those countries are currently preventing our enemies from reaching our backs, so we should give them as much assistance as possible." He also urged the U.S. government to accelerate the production of military industries and, where possible, adopt a 24-hour system in aircraft manufacturing. However, he reiterated that this move is quite difficult to implement because the United States does not have so many skilled workers at this time. (United Press, 6th)</p>

<p>Athens – Following bloody hand-to-hand combat, Greek soldiers occupied the important Albanian seaport of Santi Quaranta yesterday. This location is a critical supply route for Italian forces. British and Greek aircraft also wiped out a fleeing Italian mechanized unit after the Greek forces occupied the city. Another Greek force is currently fiercely attacking Elbasan, which is only 24 miles from the Albanian capital, Tirana. Greek forces occupied Santi Quaranta after crossing a swamp that the Italians considered impassable. The capture of this city has caused the collapse of the Italian war effort in southern Albania. News from the Struga front indicates that Greek forces occupied a village only three kilometers from Santi Quaranta after fierce fighting north of Lake Ohrid on Wednesday. Casualties were significant on both sides in this engagement. Greek forces then opened the road across the swamp to Santi Quaranta and Delvina, encircling the port's railway in a semi-circle. With their position in danger, the Italian forces began to retreat. Greek forces entered the city yesterday morning. News from Struga indicates that in the Moschopolis region, Greek forces are only 22 kilometers northwest of Moschopolis and are continuing to advance. British and Greek aircraft again bombed Vlora yesterday, inflicting considerable damage. A government spokesman stated, "The Gamia plateau northwest of Pogradec is now in our hands." It is reported that the main Italian forces are now concentrated on the Vojussa River at Tiberini, north of Santi Quaranta. Italian forces have suffered extremely heavy losses due to bombing by British and Greek aircraft. (United Press dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Athens – According to recent battle reports received here, Potoaeda has fallen into Greek hands, and Argyrokastron is also on the verge of capture. It is reported that the Greek vanguard is fiercely pursuing the Italian forces retreating eastward from Potoaeda. It is reported that Argyrokastron has been completely secured by Greek forces; they are chanting the slogan "Celebrate Christmas in Tirana." It is understood that all Italian forces, except for the rearguard forces fighting to cover the retreat, have completely withdrawn from Potoaeda. Greek sources claim that the main force of the Italian garrison at Argyrokastron has abandoned the city, and the radio in the city has been silent since Wednesday night. (International News Service dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Rome – Italian newspapers reported this morning that Italian aircraft shot down five enemy aircraft flying in Greek airspace yesterday. Recently, snow has accumulated on the roads, and Italian aircraft have taken this opportunity to strafe Greek forces traveling on the roads. As a result, large formations of Greek troops only dare to march at night. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Budapest – According to recent battle reports from Athens, Greek forces occupied Potoaeda at night and reached the outskirts of Tiberini. However, they were repelled by Italian forces after half an hour of hand grenade and bayonet fighting. (International News Service dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Athens – An official communique recently stated that British and Greek aircraft are currently bombing the highway leading to Panormos, which is filled with Italian forces fleeing from Santi Quaranta. Santi Quaranta was completely occupied by Greek forces this morning, and Greek forces have now entered the city. The communique continued that Italian forces have retreated northward from Santi Quaranta, while Greek forces are still advancing. (United Press dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Rome – According to the Italian High Command, the enemy continues to advance on the Greek front, and the left flank is under considerable pressure. The enemy is reportedly transferring troops from various fronts to attack. Italian forces have counterattacked, with the Alessio and Venezia Divisions fighting very bravely. Italian air fleets are bombing enemy communication lines and concentrations of enemy troops, and strafing with machine guns. Italian aircraft have all returned to their bases. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Nanjing – According to newspaper reports, the weather on the Greek front was bad yesterday. Italian forces in the south have retreated to a new defense line from Himara to Tepeleni. Italian forces have withdrawn from Argyrokastron, and Greek forces have occupied Frasheri. Italian forces are reinforcing the north and putting up a stubborn resistance, but Greek forces have occupied the Combiajet mountain area near Polerat. Fierce fighting is currently taking place along the entire front. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Athens – According to recent news from the front lines, there was heavy snow and dense fog yesterday, and air activity was greatly reduced. Greek forces launched successive and fierce attacks with bayonets, completely clearing Italian forces from Mount Mokra. Italian forces on the northwest side were only able to retreat after suffering heavy casualties and losing a large number of weapons. Many soldiers were captured by Greek forces. Greek forces on the central front have advanced past Premeti, encircling an Italian division and capturing many heavy artillery pieces and countless soldiers. At the same time, retreating and reinforcing Italian forces were bombed by British and Greek aircraft. Yesterday, both Santi Quaranta and Argyrokastron were ablaze with light. It was that the retreating Italian forces burned military supplies. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Italian Army Chief of Staff Replaced</p>
<p>Rome – Italian Army Chief of Staff General Badoglio has submitted his resignation, which was approved today. General Cavallero has been appointed as Chief of Staff. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Milan – The new Italian Army Chief of General Staff, General Cavallero, was born in Monferrato in 1880. He studied at the Modena Military Academy. During the First World War, he served as the Director of Operations for the General Staff. After the armistice, he served as the leader of the Italian military delegation to the Allied Council in Versailles. After 1926, he served as a senator. He is the chairman of the German-Italian Military Commission. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Athens – Greek officials are paying close attention to the news today that Italian Army Chief of Staff General Badoglio has resigned and has been succeeded by General Cavallero, considering it a public acknowledgment by the Italian side of military defeats. According to recent reports from the front, Italian vehicles on all fronts are now retreating towards the sea rather than continuing to retreat inland. Military observers generally believe that this situation is far more important than the occupation of a city or village. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Greek Forces Continue to Advance, Italian Forces Retreat Towards the Sea</p>
<p>Athens – Greek forces are continuing to fight bravely and have made important gains in the past few hours, especially in the northern area near Pogradec. Several more locations in that area have been occupied by Greek forces. According to recent reports from the front, Italian forces have been forced to retreat towards the sea rather than retreating to inland lines, appearing to be making a general retreat to the west. Military observers here believe that the westward retreat of the Italian forces is far more important than the occupation of small cities and towns by Greek forces. Italian forces are currently retreating as quickly as possible towards the Albanian port of Himara, 30 miles north of Santi Quaranta. There has been fierce fighting between infantry and artillery units near Argyrokastron in the past 48 hours. The British and Greek air forces have provided significant support, concentrating their bombing on enemy troop concentrations, mechanized units, and military camps. The Greek strategy seems to be to make the Italian forces flee in panic, without rest. Therefore, after capturing Pogradec, the Greek forces did not pause but continued to advance, intending to reach the source of the Skumbi River. At the same time, Greek forces are advancing west and northwest from Moscopole, so the left flank lines are all active. Greek forces, holding a belief in inevitable victory, are advancing bravely. Greek newspaper war correspondents claim that the Greek army and its organization are far superior to the Italian army, so they are constantly gaining advantages everywhere. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Fierce Fighting in the North, Italian Forces Retreat to Linzhen</p>
<p>Nanjing – According to news from the southern Albanian border here, the fighting was exceptionally fierce on the northern front of the Greek-Italian front on Wednesday night. Both sides suffered heavy casualties. Greek forces engaged Italian forces in bayonet combat, and the Italian forces finally retreated to Linzhen. Greek forces claimed last night that there were no Italian forces to be found on Mount Gamia and Mount Mokra. Due to the heavy snowstorm on the northern front, there was no air combat. On the southern front, Italian aircraft attacked Greek positions and the city of Preveza. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Greek Forces Advance Victoriously Through Heavy Snowstorm</p>
<p>Athens – With biting cold winds and skin-splitting frost, snow falling from the sky, and roads mired in knee-deep mud, the Greek army, facing such difficult conditions, and in the face of fierce resistance from the Italian forces, is still attacking relentlessly without backing down. For the past eight days, the Greek forces have continued to brave the wind and rain and fight to the death with the Italian forces. This is what the Greek military spokesman told reporters today, regarding the situation on the front lines for the past eight days and the Greek forces' resolute response to the terrible pressure. The Greek military spokesman said that the Greek forces are carrying out difficult attacks ahead of the Italian lines, which are very extensive. The famous Greek Evzone soldiers, after occupying Premeti, are pressing even harder, not giving the Italian forces the slightest chance to catch their breath, and are quickly attacking Kosura. The main force of the Greek forces is fiercely fighting in the high plateaus, which are covered in thick snow. The fighting in the Argyrokastron region is still ongoing, and Greek radio is replying to Italian radio, saying, "Argyrokastron belongs to the Greeks and will continue to be occupied by the Greeks until the end of the war." The Greek military spokesman predicts that in the next 48 hours, the Greeks may occupy important positions that have never been occupied before. At present, the radio station in Argyrokastron has been occupied by the Greek forces, and the storage depots in the area have caught fire. Italian tanks and armored forces have formed another rear guard force in the Santi Quaranta area to cover the retreating troops, and are setting up defenses and building trenches at the port of Himara. Three major fires have broken out in Santi Quaranta, which is believed to be due to the retreating Italian forces burning warehouses, as they cannot carry the stored military supplies and therefore set them ablaze. According to news from the front lines, when an Italian destroyer in the waters off Santi Quaranta was bombed, it was heard that many Italian troops on board were killed or injured, as the ship was carrying a large number of Italian troops and military supplies. The Greek military spokesman also said that north of Pogradec, the Greek forces are still fiercely attacking Italian forces in the snow-covered highlands, with both sides bombarding each other with heavy artillery.

<h3 id="e20">Military Experts Review the Greek-Italian War Situation: If Greek Forces Occupy Two Key Ports, the Overall Situation Can Be Considered Settled <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>London – A Reuters military commentator said that the Greek campaign has dealt a major blow to the Axis powers, and the one suffered by Mussolini is a significant one. However, the overall result is not yet determined. This result has far-reaching implications and must be achieved with the greatest courage in order to reap the full rewards. Therefore, everything from now on depends on courage, in other words, the strategy of this campaign must be decided by the commander-in-chief. Should the Greek forces adopt a cautious strategy, not pursuing the enemy to the end, but reaching the sea and ending the advance after destroying the Italian forces in Albania? This seems to be the big question that the commander-in-chief must decide. The purpose of this strategy is to establish good communication lines in the rear and prevent the Italian forces from counterattacking. In theory, this strategy is safer than a deeper advance, but is it really so in practice? The Italian side will thus be able to calmly reorganize and bring in reinforcements from Italy. At that point, the Greek position may not necessarily be safer. The Italian forces can get a breather to revive their morale, and Hitler can also send heavy troops to help. Although there are many precedents of armies advancing too deeply, with supplies cut off, and ultimately collapsing when encountering a strong enemy, such as the Turkish victory over the Greeks in 1924, following precedents without regard to the vastly different circumstances of today and yesterday is not a way to win. Taking advantage of victory to pursue, advancing more and more fiercely, seizing fortresses, and annihilating the enemy are common occurrences in military history, such as Napoleon chasing the Prussian army after the Battle of Jena in the past, capturing Berlin in a few weeks. In this war, the German army pursued the French army all the way to Bordeaux, not allowing the French army to make use of its new base in time. On the other hand, adhering to the idea of not pursuing a desperate enemy, losing the meaning of killing the enemy and achieving results, allowing the enemy to revive their flames, and losing all previous achievements, are also innumerable in military history. For example, after Wellington's great victories at Salamanca and Vitoria, because he did not pursue the defeated troops with sufficient strength, the French side was able to make a comeback, causing the British army to lose many of the gains it had made. The situation in Albania today is more suitable for the Greek forces' fierce pursuit. Although communication lines are not without difficulties and there is a lack of railways, advancing rapidly towards important strongholds should not cause excessive difficulties in transportation. The British and Greek fleets should be able to attack the ports of Vlora and Durazzo with their highly effective coordination when the Greek army approaches. If the Greek forces occupy these two ports, then as far as the Albanian campaign is concerned, the overall situation can be said to be settled. At that point, most of the Italian forces will either surrender or die. Even if a small number escape north, they will not be a threat. Mussolini, although he speaks grandly, only has one port left in the northern corner of Albania. Even if he wants to send reinforcements to Albania to restore his fate, it is impossible. The Greek army, holding Lake Ohrid in the east and relying on the coast in the west, is in a better position to deal with everything. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>

The improvement of Turkish-Bulgarian relations has greatly eased the tense political situation in Turkey. Since German Ambassador Papen returned to Turkey, it is clear that the localization of the Greek-Italian war has also improved the Turkish political situation.

<p>Commentary from Pravda</p>
<p>Moscow – Yesterday marked the fourth anniversary of the Stalin Constitution. Pravda commented, "The Stalin Constitution has promoted the entire development of the Soviet state. The construction of Soviet socialism, the elimination of exploitation, and the development of Soviet democracy are all reflected in the Constitution. The Soviet people are united by indestructible friendship, so the Soviet system is extremely solid. The Stalin Constitution has given the Soviet working masses great rights, such as the right to work, the right to rest, and the right to material security in old age and illness. In short, the Soviet people are all proud to enjoy these rights. In all socialist construction work, we feel the life force that the Stalin Constitution gives us. We have witnessed countless achievements, and production is also increasing. At a time when the scourge of war is spreading, the Soviet people can still remain outside the situation. This is thanks to the wise Stalin's policy of peace. In 1938, 170 million people celebrated the Stalin Constitution. Last year, it increased to 183 million (including Western Ukraine and Western Belarus). This year, the number of celebrants has increased even further to 193 million, including Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Bessarabia, Northern Bukovina. Since the people of the Baltic republics gained the right to express their opinions freely, they have unanimously agreed to join the great Soviet Union. As for the political activities and joyous situation of the people of these countries, it can be verified by the words of Kagunisko, a teacher from Bessarabia. Kagunisko said, "We, on behalf of all the liberated people, assure you that we will soon be able to work in the manner of the Stakhanovites and protect our freedom and happiness in the manner of Stalin."

<p>Capital of Yugoslavia – The Truth newspaper here carries a dispatch from Istanbul, stating that Turkey is willing to mediate the Greek-Italian war, if it can be sure that the peace proposal can be effective. It is said that the mission of German Ambassador Papen, who recently went to Turkey, was to entice Turkey to engage in mediation, and the step will be for the Turkish Foreign Minister to visit Greece to visit Greek Prime Minister Metaxas. (United Press dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Budapest – According to well-informed diplomatic circles here, the German proposal to end the Greek-Italian war was handed over by Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoğlu to Greek Prime Minister General Metaxas at a secret meeting in Thessaloniki. It is reported that German Ambassador to Turkey Papen handed over the German peace plan to Saracoğlu in Ankara a few days ago and suggested to Greece the German mediation method and certain concessions to Greece. Greek and Turkish political circles here have neither confirmed nor denied this news. However, the Greek side pointed out that Greece and Germany will continue to maintain relations. Diplomatic circles also said that since Germany recently wooed Bulgaria to join the Axis powers, the pressure from Germany to force Greece to accept peace was not unexpected. The same source said that, according to news at the time, Germany allowed Bulgaria to satisfy its demands on Greece and Turkey, and promised to provide military assistance to Italy. If Turkey assisted Greece, Germany would also invade Turkey. However, this plan was suddenly thwarted because Soviet Russia quickly warned Bulgaria not to join the Axis, and adopted a strong position to resist the German army's attack on the Dardanelles and other important areas connecting to the Soviet Union. It is said that the German plan was unsuccessful and the position of the Axis powers deteriorated further due to Italy's disastrous defeat in Greece. Therefore, it was decided to quickly end the Greek-Italian war, because this war did not follow the procedures set by Berlin and Rome from the beginning.

<p>London - The Axis powers' peace proposal was destined to fail. The British left-wing movement, demanding an end to the war, was rejected by an absolute majority in the House of Commons yesterday. The motion, initiated by the radical elements of the Independent Labour Party and supported by Gallagher, the sole Communist member of Parliament, was rejected by 341 votes to 4, setting a new record for House of Commons votes. (International Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>Stockholm - During yesterday's session of the British House of Commons, the peace proposal put forward by three Independent Labour Party members received only six votes, including the proposers. The other three votes came from two Labour Party members and Gallagher, the sole Communist member. The proposer, McGovern, stated that if the war does not end, the nation's industrial areas will face the same fate as Coventry. Chamberlain's appeasement policy, regardless, is better than war. He urged members not to be deceived by declarations of fighting for freedom and democracy. He argued that now is the time to establish peace based on justice and equality. Militarily, Britain and Germany are evenly matched, with Germany having a military advantage, but the wealth of the British Empire and material aid from America can offset this. The second proposer, Stephen, stated that it is time for Britain to show the world its moral position, allowing the other side to propose peace based on justice for all nations. The basic condition is restoring the freedom of all countries and combining the material resources of Britain and Germany to build a new world civilization. Subsequently, Labour leader Griffiths spoke, stating that everyone welcomes genuine peace but does not wish to choose surrender. He hoped the British government would announce its peace objectives. Then, Liberal and Conservative members spoke, either in favor or against. Finally, Lord Privy Seal Major Attlee, representing the government, refuted the peace proposal, stating that the British government's aim is to establish a peaceful world and free humanity.

<p>London - Yesterday and this morning, British planes and anti-aircraft batteries again repelled group air raids by German planes on southern English ports. It is reported that in the past thirty-six hours, Britain has gained far more than it has lost on both offense and defense. The German air force is clearly weakening. It is reported that German planes first dropped flares to illuminate the southern ports before launching a fierce attack. The Ministry of Aviation announced that concentrated Nazi bomber formations appeared over the port, but intense anti-aircraft fire forced them to stay at high altitude. British fighter squadrons eventually drove off all the raiders. Last night, air raid sirens sounded twice in London, but German planes only appeared near London, dropping a few bombs in the suburbs. Before dawn today, large gun batteries along the Channel continued a furious exchange of fire across the Channel. (International Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>Berlin - The German High Command announced this morning that large formations of German planes carried out group air raids on London and a key port in southern England early today. However, the British denied this.

The German High Command claimed that a German patrol plane encountered a British mine-laying aircraft over the North Sea yesterday and shot it down. (International Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>London - This morning, the Ministry of Aviation announced that enemy air raids began after dark yesterday, but stopped before midnight. The scale of the attacks was not very large. The main areas bombed were in the south coast region, where high-explosive and incendiary bombs were dropped, destroying churches, houses, shops, and other buildings, and causing some casualties. A few bombs fell in the London area, but damage was minimal. Yesterday, fourteen German planes were shot down over Britain. Two British fighters went missing, but the pilot of one plane escaped safely. (Reuters, 6th)</p>

<p>London - The British Air Force launched attacks on Wednesday night and day, with its main targets being the Mannesmann and Rheinmetall-Borsig arms factories in the Düsseldorf area (6,000 workers), railway yards, wharves along the Rhine River, docks, coal plants, and gas plants. There was dense cloud cover that night, but the first British planes arriving in Düsseldorf found gaps in the clouds and dropped high-explosive and incendiary bombs, causing immediate explosions and fires in more than ten locations. Other British planes continued to attack Düsseldorf for twelve hours. One pilot saw fifteen to twenty large fires inside and outside the city's railway yard, with intense flames and the edges of the clouds glowing red, indicating that the area had been heavily damaged. Turin in Italy was also attacked by the British Air Force, with the main target being its many arms factories. Large bombs were dropped, causing heavy damage in order to reduce the production of cannons, tanks, and other military equipment. The attacking British planes first encountered dense clouds, but the weather suddenly cleared over the Alps, providing excellent visibility when they reached Turin. After completing the mission, they all returned safely. According to the Ministry of Aviation Intelligence, Britain received the first report of the attack from a pilot who radioed, "Attack successful, weather clear." Several hours later, the first British plane returned. One British bomber dropped several bombs on the FIAT factory en route, but most British planes concentrated on bombing the Royal Arsenal, causing immediate explosions and fires, with dense smoke billowing up two to three thousand feet. Other British bombers arrived subsequently and dropped bombs, continuously bombarding the arsenal from 9 PM for two hours. One pilot said that the target area was covered in fires and explosions, and that minutes after the last British planes left the area, another explosion like thunder was heard, with flames shooting high, visible from fifty miles away. The FIAT factory was hit by two bombs, causing explosions and fires. An affiliated factory that produced motors for aircraft engines was also attacked, with two bombs exploding in the main factory buildings, causing internal fires. (Reuters, 6th)</p>

The King then traveled to Portsmouth to inspect the docks, where he was enthusiastically greeted by workers and met some of the sailors recently receiving American destroyers. The King encountered another air raid as he drove away from the docks in his car. (Reuters, 6th)</p>

The purpose of the exercises was to allow the command to study the use of highly mechanized corps in rapid offensives. The main observer was General Brooke, Commander-in-Chief of Home Forces. The British troops in the exercises conducted a purely offensive action along a front of forty miles, with a target sixty miles away. An infantry division advanced against strong "enemy" resistance, supported by two squadrons of military aircraft. Another squadron was linked with a division of anti-tank guns. (Reuters, 6th)</p>

<p>Gamelin continued, "This may just be a trick, but Goering's speech yesterday predicted a major development in the war. Judging by his consistent style, he doesn't seem to be lying. Perhaps the German general offensive is imminent."</p>
<p>His calm demeanor, waiting for the enemy's strike, reassured people and privately praised him as another calm and unperturbed Joffre. However, Reynaud did not agree.</p>
<p>Reynaud often asked, "Why should there be two commanders-in-chief? If Chief of Staff General Georges is responsible for commanding the army, why not let Gamelin be Chief of Staff and Minister of National Defense?"</p>
<p>Reynaud and Gamelin were at odds, not only because of their different personalities, but because of the conflict between two military doctrines. Since the beginning of the war, Gamelin advocated a defensive posture, waiting for the right moment to act, while Reynaud was known for advocating offensive warfare.</p>
<p>Reynaud said, "A general who only defends and does not attack will inevitably lose every battle."</p>
<p>He had been allowed to step up the leadership of the war and come to power, so he naturally had to adopt a decisive plan. However, his possibilities were quite limited. From the time he visited London, he firmly advocated that Britain should lay mines in Norwegian territorial waters. Later, he found a proposal in the Foreign Office archives to establish an Anglo-French agreement that neither side could make peace alone. Daladier had always refused to recognize this, but Reynaud brought it up again. Then he raised the issue of Belgium, arguing that troops should be sent not after the Belgian government asked for help, but when they forced Belgium to state its position.</p>
<p>He asked the Belgian cabinet, "Are you in favor of us, or against us? If you are in favor of us, of course, you should quickly cooperate and strengthen the defense of the two countries' borders. If you are against us..."</p>
<p>Gamelin strongly disagreed, saying that such a method would be tantamount to driving fish into the deep, causing the Belgian army of twenty-five divisions to go over to the enemy. The two clashed fiercely. If it hadn't been for Minister of War Daladier's insistence on resigning, Reynaud would have replaced Gamelin with General Georges as early as mid-April. Although Reynaud did not dare to take this risk lightly and let Daladier resign, his personal position seemed to have been strengthened compared to before. The British action in Norwegian territorial waters and the victory in the Battle of Narvik made the French rejoice, and Reynaud's prestige also increased sharply.</p>
<p>On April 20th, he declared in the Chamber of Deputies, "The enemy's railway lines for transporting iron have been effectively cut off." A few days earlier, he had won by only one vote, but this time he gained unanimous support from the Chamber of Deputies. I felt relieved when I heard the news, but that night I met a senator who told me that this meant nothing.</p>
<p>He said gloomily, "You don't know the tricks of the parliament. Reynaud's unanimous support was due to the efforts of his opponents. If he could win a majority, it would be his personal victory, but unanimity expresses deep patriotism and concern for the country, not for him."</p>
<p>The next day I met with Reynaud himself. He was pacing back and forth in the Foreign Office residence, with his hands in his pockets. When he saw me coming, he loudly told me about what he had found after he came to power, which made me very shocked.</p>
<p>He said, "The tanks only exist on paper. The domestic order is even more chaotic. The army needs cannons and machine guns, which are still hidden in the armories. The Germans have two hundred divisions, or perhaps two hundred and forty divisions, but our army has less than one hundred divisions. Daladier is procrastinating and obstructing all reform plans, making the government powerless."</p>
<p>I said, "Even so, Daladier is still a patriot! When he broadcasts on the radio, he is eloquent and his words touch people's hearts."</p>
<p>Reynaud said, "Yes, I believe he wants France to win, but he wants my failure even more."</p>
<p>This surprising comment may not be entirely appropriate, but it came from the heart, and the depth of their resentment can be seen.</p>

<h3 id="e44">All Shanghai Municipal Council Staff Receive Pay Raise; Living Allowance Increased to 150 Percent; Rice Allowance Calculation Standard Adjusted and Will Also Be Increased; Allowances for Chinese Constables Implemented Since Last Month <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's Information Office announced yesterday the approval of increases in allowances for Chinese constables and staff. The announcement stated that the Council felt it was necessary to consider the salary issue for all staff as a matter of urgency, especially the salaries of Chinese constables. Upon investigation, Chinese constables expressed dissatisfaction with their current salaries, leading to unrest. The Council believes that this is a sign of dissatisfaction among all staff regarding their treatment. The Police Department has special issues in some respects, which distinguishes police personnel from those in other departments. However, to maintain a good administrative structure, the Council believes that all staff should receive treatment that is in line with the current situation.</p>
<p>Living Allowances Increased Across the Board</p>
<p>The Council had originally intended to postpone this issue pending the report of the Economic Committee, but this was not possible in reality, and the public also deeply hoped that the Council would take immediate action. The Council first considered the salaries of Chinese staff not holding contracts and decided to increase the current temporary cost of living allowance from 85 percent to 150 percent, with a minimum amount of 40 yuan. This minimum amount, calculated based on the lowest-paid Chinese staff, means that the amount of allowance received is more than 150 percent. As for the rice allowance, the minimum amount was changed to 15 yuan. The calculation method is based on a rice price of 35 yuan per picul. The difference between the standard price and the rice price will be subsidized by the Council for half.</p>
<p>Chinese Constable Treatment Now Superior</p>
<p>Currently, each single Chinese constable receives about 69 yuan per month, including the recently approved increase in housing allowance. Chinese constables with families receive about 75 yuan per month. Under the new method, each single constable will receive at least 109 yuan per month, and constables with families will receive 130 yuan per month. (The above figures include the special labor allowance for constables, which is 15 yuan for single constables and 30 yuan for those with families.) At the same time, the amount of rice allowance, calculated based on the current rice price, can still be increased.</p>
<p>Senior Staff Also Benefit</p>
<p>The Council also considered the treatment of Chinese and foreign staff holding contracts. The Council has always been aware that the staff salary system was not satisfactory, but whenever it intended to increase salaries, it often tried to reduce the increase rate for the sake of saving expenses. Today, it feels it is necessary to increase salaries again in order to maintain administrative efficiency. This year, 170 such staff members have submitted resignations to the Council, and more resignations are likely to follow. They are all doing this because they are dissatisfied with the Council's current salary system, which has a significant impact on the Council's administration. After repeated deliberation, the Council decided to increase the temporary cost of living allowance as follows: (1) A cost of living allowance of 150 percent will be given for the first 500 yuan of their total salary. (2) A cost of living allowance of 125 percent will be given for the portion of their salary from 501 yuan to 1,000 yuan. (3) A cost of living allowance of 100 percent will be given for the portion of their salary above 1,000 yuan. The above methods apply equally to Chinese and foreign staff, regardless of their salary amount. In addition, the current 12 percent "subsistence" allowance is abolished. The methods for increasing allowances for Chinese constables and Chinese staff not holding contracts will be implemented from November.</p>
<p>Comparison Table of Chinese Constable Salaries and Allowances</p>
<p>New Method (Implemented from November)</p>
<p>"Single Constable" "Constable with Family"</p>
<p>Basic Salary 21 yuan 21 yuan</p>
<p>Minimum Living Allowance 40 yuan 40 yuan</p>
<p>Housing Allowance 18 yuan 24 yuan</p>
<p>Minimum Rice Allowance 15 yuan 15 yuan</p>
<p>Special Labor Allowance 15 yuan 30 yuan</p>
<p>Total 109 yuan Total 130 yuan</p>
<p>October Method</p>
<p>"Single Constable" "Constable with Family"</p>
<p>Basic Salary 21 yuan 21 yuan</p>
<p>Minimum Living Allowance 20 yuan 20 yuan</p>
<p>Approximate Rice Allowance 11 yuan 10 yuan</p>
<p>Total 61 yuan Total 63.50 yuan</p>
<p>"Notes" (1) As can be seen from the above table, a single constable who received 61 yuan in October will receive at least 109 yuan from November. A constable with a family who received 63.50 yuan in October will receive at least 130 yuan from December.</p>
<p>(2) The calculation of the rice allowance is based on a standard price of 35 yuan per picul for No. 2 Saigon rice. If the rice price rises to 80 yuan, the rice allowance should be 22.5 yuan. If the rice price rises to 90 yuan, the rice allowance should be 27.5 yuan. If the rice price rises to 100 yuan, the rice allowance should be 32.5 yuan.</p>

<p>According to reliable sources in foreign diplomatic circles in this city, U.S. Defense Force Commander in Shanghai, Colonel Baker, and U.S. Yangtze River Fleet Commander, Glassford, visited the U.S. Consulate on Jiangxi Road yesterday at around 11:00 AM to hold an important meeting with U.S. Consul General Lockhead. The meeting adjourned at noon. It is understood that important U.S. military and political leaders in Shanghai have not convened meetings for some time. However, there have been two meetings this week, the first taking place on Monday morning, and the second being yesterday's meeting. It is widely believed that the meetings are related to the current situation in the concession. Furthermore, according to well-informed sources, although Admiral Lockhead is currently away from Shanghai, spending the winter in the Philippines, important U.S. naval officers stationed in Shanghai, such as Rear Admiral Glassford, are maintaining close contact with Admiral Lockhead via telegrams. U.S. Consul General Lockhead is also in frequent contact with authorities in Washington. A foreign diplomatic source told a reporter from the Pingming News Agency that the United States is closely monitoring all aspects of the situation in Shanghai, paying particular attention to all movements of the Japanese, regardless of their significance.</p>
<p>U.S. Gunboat Guam Scheduled to Sail to Hankou</p>
<p>According to sources close to the U.S. Navy, the U.S. warships currently docked in Shanghai include the "Guam" and "Luzon." It is reported that the U.S. naval authorities have decided to dispatch the Yangtze River gunboat "Guam" to Hankou. The ship's departure from Shanghai is scheduled for next Monday, the 9th of this month.</p>
<p>New Japanese Commander Visits U.S. Consulate Yesterday</p>
<p>Yesterday at around 10:00 AM, the newly appointed Japanese Gendarmerie Commander, Major General Kobayashi Jin, visited the U.S. Consulate on Jiangxi Road to pay a courtesy call on U.S. Consul General Lockhead. The meeting lasted about twenty minutes before he departed. However, it is understood that this meeting was purely a routine visit and had no other significance.</p>

<p>Regarding the case of Japanese merchants operating buses along Yuyuan Road in the western Shanghai sealed-off area without permission, both the British-owned Shanghai Public Omnibus Company and the Public Tramway Company lodged protests with the Municipal Council yesterday. The manager of the British-owned Shanghai Public Omnibus Company, Mr. Currie, told reporters that the Japanese action clearly infringes on the company's rights, and that the company has lodged a strong protest with the authorities. Meanwhile, an employee of the Tramway Company revealed that the company has also lodged a protest with the British Consul General George. A spokesperson for the Municipal Council stated that the Council is considering the protests from both companies and may file a protest with the Japanese authorities. He added that the Japanese operating buses without the Municipal Council's permission directly infringes on the Council's interests. A spokesperson for the Japanese Embassy declined to comment on the matter, stating that a statement may be made at a press conference.</p>
<p>Hope and Prayer Speak Volumes</p>
<p>The English-language Da Mei Evening News reports that Japanese-operated buses entered Yidingpan Road, adjacent to the sealed-off area, yesterday (the 5th). Regarding this matter, a reporter recently met with a spokesperson for the Municipal Council, who was asked what steps the Council will take to oppose the Japanese action. The spokesperson replied that the Municipal Council will "hope and pray" for the British-owned Public Omnibus Company's exclusive operating rights in the western district. When the reporter asked if the Municipal Council would invite a choir to sing hymns to assist with this special prayer, the spokesperson declined to comment further.</p>
<p>Five Buses Still Operating Yesterday</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Japanese-operated buses continued to infringe on the British-owned Public Omnibus Company's exclusive rights this morning, dispatching several buses to operate on Yuyuan Road. The British-owned Public Omnibus Company has not yet filed a protest but indicated that a protest will be lodged soon. Currently, there are five Japanese-operated buses operating in the western district, charging a uniform fare of two jiao. Some people fear that the appearance of Japanese-operated buses in the western district will usurp the British-owned company's exclusive rights, as has happened in the Hongkou district. However, an employee of the British-owned Public Omnibus Company stated that the company will take various measures to prevent this from happening.</p>
<p>Japanese Actions Meticulously Planned</p>
<p>A reporter from the Da Zhong News Agency, believing that the operation of "Japanese-operated buses" on roads beyond the settlement boundary in the western district is a significant matter, specifically inquired about this with a Chinese employee of the British-owned China Public Omnibus Company. According to the employee, the company has lost over 30,000 yuan during the six days of the blockade, with daily losses exceeding 5,000 yuan. The company has exclusive operating rights for buses within the Public Concession, and it appears that there is no way to compensate for these unexpected losses. It is rumored that the Japanese side has been plotting to seize these rights in the area for a long time and is simply taking advantage of the opportunity to profit. The company's management and the responsible authorities in the concession are maintaining close contact every day, but it is unknown whether they have filed a protest with the Japanese side. According to another reliable source, the so-called "Shanghai Western District Public Buses" have been prepared for some time, with route signs and tickets already printed in large quantities. From this perspective, it is clearly not a temporary attempt to profit.</p>
<h3 id="e51">Conditions at the Western Shanghai Blockade Line Yesterday <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>All Luggage and Food Subject to Search</p>
<p>The situation at the Western Shanghai blockade yesterday was not significantly different from the previous day. A reporter from the Da Zhong News Agency entered Yuyuan Road from Jisi Fei Road Qianjia Lane (Qianjia Lane is opposite Yuguang Village), where the number of people entering and leaving was extremely high. The barbed wire had been removed, and five or six hired policemen were stationed there, inspecting luggage and belongings. Continuing west along Yuyuan Road, apart from a few private cars and "public buses," there were very few other vehicles on the road. At the intersection of Yuyuan Road and Yidingpan Road, a barbed wire fence was placed in the middle of the blockade line, with two openings on either side for pedestrians and vehicles to pass through. A Japanese military policeman and five or six hired policemen were stationed there. The blockade line on Yidingpan Road (at the Yuyuan Road intersection) was tightly closed with barbed wire, and no Chinese or foreigners were allowed to enter or exit.</p>
<p>Food Panic</p>
<p>The reporter then entered Yidingpan Road from a small alley on Yuyuan Road and observed that all alley entrances on the east side of the section from Yuyuan Road to Daxilu (including the Jialong Lane, the location of the Sasaki assassination incident) were heavily sealed off with barbed wire. No one was allowed to enter or exit. This area is considered by the Japanese side to be a hiding place for terrorists and must be thoroughly searched to eliminate the source of trouble. It is understood that several searches have been conducted, but the perpetrator has not been found. Rumors circulating in the area suggest that the assassin of Sasaki was a Japanese anti-war element. Although this claim is not considered reliable, it is widely circulated. Within this area, there is widespread panic about food and other supplies. Some residents have used "ingenious methods" to sneak out, but the number is very small. The inspection at the Yidingpan Road Daxilu intersection blockade line is also very strict.</p>
<h3 id="e52">Statistics on Imported Rice Sales Prove That a Rice Shortage is Impossible Based on Customs Records and Reports from Various Warehouses <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>Although the rice reserves in this city are very plentiful, the exact amount is still a matter of concern for the general public. A reporter from the Pingming News Agency has learned that an economic statistics agency estimates that the city's rice reserves are increasing rather than decreasing, making a rice shortage impossible. It is hoped that citizens will not easily believe rumors and cause themselves unnecessary anxiety. There are three bases for this conclusion:</p>
<p>Arrival and Sales Statistics</p>
<p>(1) According to customs records, from January to October of this year, a total of 5.6 million metric tons of imported rice arrived (compared to 2.7 million metric tons in the same period last year). After deducting over 32,000 metric tons for export, the net import was over 5.5 million metric tons. If this is divided equally over ten months, the monthly import is 550,000 metric tons, equivalent to 1.1 million city dan or 700,000 shi. According to Mr. Yu Qiaqing's estimate, the city's daily consumption of rice is 9,000 shi, or 270,000 shi per month. Therefore, after deducting consumption, there is a net surplus of 400,000 shi per month, meaning a surplus of 4 million shi since October. Domestic rice sources and private imports are not included in this calculation. (2) According to reports from 30 warehouses on their regular rice reserves, the amount was 74,000 bags at the end of last year, 101,000 bags at the end of June this year, and 142,000 bags at the beginning of November. Although this is only a partial survey, it is sufficient to show that the reserves are trending upwards. (3) The recent number of imported rice arrivals shows that rice reserves are increasing rather than decreasing. Considering the last four days, 16,549 bags arrived on December 2nd, over 10,000 bags arrived on the 3rd, over 10,000 bags arrived on the 4th, and over 2,000 bags arrived on the 5th. In addition, there are several thousand to tens of thousands of bags arriving every day. A review of economic news reports will make this clear. Since rice reserves are increasing rather than decreasing and the supply is continuous, it is clear that the crux of the city's food problem lies purely in the hoarding and manipulation of speculators.

<p>According to the English-language Da Mei Evening News, it was learned from reliable sources yesterday morning (the 6th) that the Japanese authorities here are planning to "confiscate" silver bars and copper ingots worth 6 million yuan stored at No. 178, Lane 1, Dushanfu Road (owned by the American trading firm, Mow Sun). The reason given is that "the Japanese side has obtained evidence proving that these silver bars belong to Chongqing."</p>
<p>Police Detectives Stationed for Protection</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, French Concession police detectives were seen stationed around Mow Sun's Dushanfu Road property. It is confirmed that the property was previously used as a dormitory for rickshaw pullers and was later taken over by Mow Sun. It is reported that the silver bars and copper ingots are all packed in boxes and sealed by the Chinese mint. The French Concession police acknowledged that they have dispatched personnel to guard Mow Sun's property on Dushanfu Road, stating that the police learned that a large quantity of silver and copper was stored there, hence the deployment of police detectives.</p>
<p>American Business Authorities Forcefully Deny It</p>
<p>Mow Sun's Deputy Manager, Mr. Klein, denied that the property contained silver bars, stating that he was unaware that any gold or silver was stored there. He claimed that there were only some old iron goods and that the rumors of silver storage were untrue, so there would be no unusual incidents. Although the French Concession police are observing the property, just as they observe other warehouses, it is quite strange that Mow Sun has not requested police protection.</p>
<p>Japanese Side Reportedly Filed a Protest</p>
<p>It is understood that the Japanese authorities have filed a protest with the American authorities here regarding these silver and copper, but yesterday the official spokesman made no comments. One account stated that Mow Sun has been managing the Dushanfu Road property and the silver and copper inside for over two years, and that the silver bars worth 6 million yuan are mostly stored in the old building formerly used as a rickshaw puller dormitory.</p>
<p>2 Million Yuan in Copper Already Seized</p>
<p>Previously, 2 million yuan worth of copper owned by Mow Sun and stored in the American-owned Ruifeng Transfer Company's warehouse was stolen. Subsequently, the Japanese authorities announced that the copper ingots had been confiscated. The U.S. Consulate in Shanghai filed a protest with the Japanese Consulate, hoping to have the goods returned to their rightful owner.</p>

<h3 id="e55">Shelter Housing Partially Completed All Necessary Supplies Prepared Small-Sum Relief Loans Available with Guarantee <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>The construction of the beggar shelter, which began nearly a week ago, is one-third complete. It is expected that the entire project will be completed in three weeks at the latest. The Municipal Council donated 15 mu of vacant land at the intersection of Hed Road and Xingjiapo Road to build 24 wooden sheds. Seven of the sheds have already been completed, each with 20 double-decker beds, accommodating 100 people. The total capacity of the shelter is expected to be 2,000 people.</p>
<p>Entire Project to Be Completed by Year-End</p>
<p>According to Salvation Army Lieutenant Colonel Ma Ruishan, he hopes that the shelter can be officially established by Christmas Day, so that on the day everyone celebrates Christmas, the homeless and foodless beggars can find a place to stay. However, the construction project may not be completed before Christmas Day, but it should be completed by the end of this year at the latest. A Chinese person has been hired as the director of the shelter, and all plans for the shelter have been decided.</p>
<p>Donations from All Sectors Daily Necessities</p>
<p>Cotton clothing, quilts, bowls, chopsticks, and all daily necessities required for the beggar shelter have been ordered by the Salvation Army. Many people from all sectors have also made generous donations. One Chinese person donated all the gifts and items given by relatives and friends for their birthday to the beggar shelter. The Municipal Council also donated 100,000 yuan to cover the full construction costs.</p>
<p>Assisting Released Prisoners to Return Home</p>
<p>In addition to providing small-sum relief loans and distributing rice tickets, the Salvation Army is also very concerned about prisoners who have just been released from prison. The organization sends representatives to visit prisons in Hongkou and the French Concession every day. The Salvation Army provides assistance to return to their hometowns for prisoners who have been released but have nowhere to turn. Currently, the organization has sent over 750 people home. Over 100 people have applied for small-sum relief loans, but applicants must have a reliable guarantor. The loan amount is limited to 30 yuan.</p>

<p>The Baoli steamer, which was detained in Shipu, returned to Shanghai yesterday. The ship sailed from Shanghai to Haimen in the middle of last month. After being denied entry, it changed course to Shipu and was allowed to enter. After the ship, another ship, the Jiangding, also entered Shipu. The Jiangding arrived in Shanghai at the end of last month, but the Baoli stayed in Shipu, leading to speculation about the ship's movements. The speculation ended with its return to Shanghai yesterday. The ship did not carry passengers on its return trip and only carried a small amount of local produce. It is expected to dock in Shanghai and will not sail for the time being.</p>

<p>The silk reeling industry in this city has recently declined due to a sharp decrease in silk exports, leading to business slump. Factories are closing down one after another. At its peak in the previous year, there were as many as 34 Chinese-owned factories in the two concessions. In addition, there were more than ten Japanese and British-owned factories. By June of this year, only 11 Chinese-owned silk mills remained. Recently, they have all completely shut down.</p>
<h3 id="e58">Shanghai Reconstruction Public Bond Lottery Highly Admired Principal and Interest Not Suspended Due to Shanghai's Fall <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>In November of the 21st year of the Republic of China, the Shanghai Municipal Government issued 6 million yuan of Shanghai Disaster Area Reconstruction Public Bonds to repair roads, bridges, and ditches in the disaster area, and to handle other post-disaster reconstruction and relief matters. The designated source of funds for repayment of principal and interest was the Shanghai Municipal Pier Donation Income. Principal and interest were paid in two installments each year, on June 15th and December 15th. The 16th installment of principal repayment was drawn at the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) the other day. Two lottery numbers were drawn: No. 55 and No. 57, for a total repayment of 120,000 yuan. The principal and interest of the 16th installment will be paid starting December 15th by HSBC. A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency learned from banking circles yesterday that the Shanghai Municipal Government, in order to maintain creditworthiness, is continuing to repay the principal and interest on the maturing disaster area reconstruction public bonds, and is not suspending payments due to Shanghai's fall. The bonds were underwritten by the British firm of Lih An at 80% of face value. Most of the bondholders are foreign businessmen. It is reported that the bondholders deeply admire the Chinese government's maintenance of creditworthiness.</p>
<h3 id="e59">First New Ship of American President Lines Circles the World Passing Through Shanghai Arrives on the 11th and Does Not Accept Tours the Ship's Interior is Exceptionally New and Luxurious <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>American President Lines is a leading shipping company on the Pacific routes. Its predecessor was the Da Lai Steamship Company. After the outbreak of war in the East in the autumn of 1938, the routes were temporarily suspended. The company was reorganized in mid-October of that year, and the ships resumed sailing. At that time, the company's general manager, Mr. Heechung, announced that due to the loss of the President Hoover in the Far East, the company would temporarily not call at Shanghai and declared that he would do everything possible to call at Shanghai again as soon as possible. The company resumed shipping operations in Shanghai on January 19 of the following year. The first ship to call at Shanghai after the resumption of service was the President Adams. However, apart from the President Coolidge, the routes have not yet been restored to their pre-incident state.</p>
<p>First Ship President Jackson</p>
<p>Since the company's reorganization and resumption of service, it has been working hard to innovate and has allocated 10 million U.S. dollars to build several new ships, including seven world-class liners, three of the same type as the President Coolidge, and four Pacific liners. The first new ship to be built was a world-class liner named President Jackson, which was launched on June 7th of this year at the Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Drydock Company. The ship has a displacement of 16,900 tons, a gross tonnage of 9,400 tons, and a speed of 19 knots per hour.</p>
<p>Interior Equipment Excellent in Every Way</p>
<p>It has 96 passenger berths, all of which are first class. There are no second, third, or fourth classes. All cabins are located on both sides of the ship, with ample ventilation. Each cabin has a bathroom and toilet. There is also a dining room, lounge, outdoor swimming pool, and other amenities. The interior temperature is regulated by scientific methods, and the cabin can be kept cool in the summer and warm in the winter without using fans or radiators. All work on the ship is mechanized to reduce manpower. The old ship had 135 crew members, but the new ship has only 110. Loading and unloading cargo is very efficient, with 18 cranes and a capacity for 60,000 cubic feet of refrigerated cargo. The engine has 85,000 horsepower and can travel 19 knots per hour.</p>
<p>Circling the World, Arrives Next Week</p>
<p>The new ships can shorten the world trip by 14 days (formerly 94 days, now only 84 days). The ship is already on its way and is expected to arrive on the 11th of this month, docking at buoys 10, 12, and 13. The company originally planned to host tours for all sectors after the ship arrived in Shanghai, but due to the current extraordinary circumstances, the company has been ordered by headquarters to cancel the tours. The ship will not stay in Shanghai for long, only stopping for one night. The next day (the 12th), it will leave Shanghai on its maiden voyage to Xinggang, Xiaoluzong, and various ports in Southeast Asia. It will then pass through the Cape of Good Hope to return to New York.</p>
<p>Second Ship Also to Set Sail</p>
<p>A total of seven world-class liners of the same design and equipment are being built. The second ship, the President Monroe, was launched on August 7th of this year at the same shipyard. It is currently being outfitted and painted and will set sail for the Far East in February of next year.</p>
<p>President Jackson</p>
<p>The President Jackson is the first completed of the seven new world-class liners. It has a displacement of 16,900 tons and a speed of 19 knots per hour. All passenger berths are first class. The air is regulated by scientific methods, eliminating the need for radiators and fans, keeping it warm in winter and cool in summer.</p>

<p>Zhu Zhu, an old Jiangbei woman living in a flat in Haizhou Road, Yangshupu, murdered her 26-year-old son, Zhu Yongxiang, because he did not engage in honest work, was a habitual vagrant, and had recently become addicted to heroin. Lacking money, he specialized in stealing and forcibly extorting money from his older brother, Zhu Yongcheng, and even prostituted his niece, among other things. His mother and brother hated him deeply. They drove him out, and he lived in a makeshift shack on vacant land on Tengyue Road. At 4:30 AM on the 22nd of last month, the mother and brother, along with the son-in-law, Dong Yuanfa, sneaked into Yongxiang's shack and strangled him to death with a hemp rope while he was asleep. The case was discovered, and Western and Chinese detectives from the Yangshupu Police Station arrested Zhu Zhu, her son Yongcheng, and son-in-law Dong Yuanfa and brought them before the First Special Court for interrogation. Details of the case have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Huang Risheng presided over a trial in the First Criminal Court and sentenced Dong Yuanfa, Zhu Zhu, and Zhu Yongcheng to five years in prison for joint homicide. The hemp rope was confiscated.</p>

<p>Shi Xiangrong, a grain merchant from Chongming residing in Shanghai at No. 1002, Avenue Edward VII, aged 49, was recently sued by his daughter-in-law, Shi Tuyan, at the Civil Division of the First Special District Court. Represented by lawyers Lu Qi and Peng Qi, Shi Tuyan filed a lawsuit against her husband for failing to provide living expenses. The case was heard yesterday by Judge Tao in the First Civil Division. The defendant, Shi Xiangrong, was represented by lawyer Zhang Shibin. Lawyer Lu Qi, representing the plaintiff Shi Tuyan, stated the case, claiming that the plaintiff is 18 years old, from Hunan, and currently residing at No. 44, Xinshi Market, Jing'an Temple Road.</p>
<p>She followed her parents away from her hometown in her youth.</p>
<p>Her father was an instructor at the Central Military Academy, but due to the expansion of the war, her father retreated with the army. The plaintiff and her mother were displaced to Shanghai. As her mother worked for the Xinxiang family, the two women depended on each other. In August of the year before last, the defendant, Shi Xiangrong, asked the plaintiff's mother to read his fortune, and the plaintiff accompanied her. The defendant, admiring the plaintiff's beauty, immediately sent a matchmaker the next day to discuss with the plaintiff's mother, saying that the defendant owned many factories and stores in Shanghai and was a wealthy merchant. The defendant decided that his son was quite talented and wanted to marry the plaintiff. At that time, the plaintiff's mother, misled by the matchmaker's words, agreed to the engagement on behalf of the plaintiff. From then on, the defendant often visited the plaintiff's home. Later, the</p>
<p>matchmaker delivered the wedding invitation,</p>
<p>stating that the wedding was scheduled for October 17th at the Tiantian Hotel. However, the defendant's first son had already passed away, and the plaintiff was now betrothed to the defendant's eldest son, Shi Zhihe (21 years old this year). At the same time, it was also stated that the defendant's eldest son was mute. At that time, the plaintiff and her mother both objected, but the matchmaker said that the defendant had enormous wealth and was willing to guarantee that the plaintiff would have no financial difficulties in her life. Later, the defendant indeed signed a guarantee, and the plaintiff and her mother agreed. The defendant also stated that he would support the plaintiff's mother for life and provide for her funeral. Unexpectedly, on the</p>
<p>second day of the plaintiff's marriage,</p>
<p>the defendant forbade the plaintiff and her husband from entering the house and rented a room for them in Xujiahui. In the beginning, the defendant provided the plaintiff and her husband with 50 yuan per month for living expenses, and the defendant also paid for firewood, rice, and rent. Later, the defendant did not fulfill his promise, and since December of last year, the defendant has not given a single penny. In February of this year, the defendant forced the plaintiff's husband to the Chongming occupied area. The plaintiff gave birth a few days ago, and the defendant and the plaintiff's husband have ignored the plaintiff's childbirth and medical expenses. Now, she has no choice but to request the court to order the defendant to</p>
<p>hand over the plaintiff's husband,</p>
<p>and order the defendant to pay 1,300 yuan for living expenses from December 15th of last year to December 24th of last year, 85 yuan for medical expenses, 152 yuan for clothing expenses, and 300 yuan for childbirth and baby clothes, and to pay 120 yuan per month for the plaintiff and the child's living expenses starting from next month. Lawyer Zhang Shibin stated that the plaintiff's husband, the defendant's eldest son, Shi Zhihe, although mute, is a photographer. He is now a photographer in Chongming. The living expenses claimed by the plaintiff should be negotiated with Shi Zhihe. The court verified the statements and instructed the defendant's lawyer to notify the defendant to first find a way to raise some childbirth expenses for the plaintiff. The case was adjourned to 3:00 PM on January 6th of next year, pending the summons of Shi Zhihe for further questioning.</p>

<h3 id="e72">Food: Foreign Rice Breaks the Three-Day Limit Again; Glutinous Rice Also Sold for 100 Yuan per Stone; Saigon No. 1 Original Packages Even More Hoarded <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>In the rice market these days, although public announcements have strictly prohibited illegal buying and selling, most speculative merchants are accustomed to it and regard it as mere formality, openly violating it in secret. Yesterday's rice price exceeded the morning market price of three days ago by more than one yuan. These people use the excuse that Saigon orders have no ships to load and that Hong Kong prohibits rice exports as a pretext for major manipulation, benefiting a small number of wholesalers and plunging millions of people into desperation. Therefore, chaos was seen at the opening of the early market, with large households and speculators competing to buy. Those with goods benefited, and the shouting soared all the way up until the market closed, exceeding the three-day limit. Saigon No. 1 opened at 88 yuan, medium at 85 yuan, No. 2 at 81 yuan and a half, and finally settled at 79 yuan and 80 cents. Fire-milled rice opened at 85 yuan and a half, and finally settled at 82 yuan and 70 cents. No. 2 Siamese rice opened at 79 yuan and 80 cents to 79 yuan, small-milled rice opened at 79 yuan to 78 yuan and 80 cents, Tokyo Bojian opened at 78 yuan to 76 yuan and 70 cents, rice chaff opened at 70 yuan and 80 cents to 70 yuan, broken rice opened at 68 yuan and a half to 66 yuan and 40 cents, and Wujian opened at 77 yuan to 76 yuan. and Saigon No. 1 original package, sold by Yinghua, was hoarded and few sold, opening at 96 yuan, December at 94 yuan, small milled at 89 yuan and a half, all about one yuan higher than the previous day. Yinghua's chips were still dry, with only 400-500 tons traded, while spot goods reached 15,000 bags when customers competed to buy them in the warehouses.</p>
<p>The source of thick and thin japonica and other domestic rice continues to be stagnant, but the sales market is still retreating due to high prices, and transactions are limited. Therefore, the market is flat. Kunshan special japonica is seen at 99 yuan per dan, large market at 97 yuan and 20 cents, thin rice original package at 94.5 yuan, and dan at 91 yuan to 89 yuan.</p>
<p>As the source of japonica glutinous rice has been cut off for a long time, and the market stock is also decreasing day by day, and it happens to be the season for sales, supply is not enough for distribution, and rare goods are expensive, so it has soared by three to five yuan. Li Yuan opened at 100 yuan, and Hong Kong Bai Yuan also increased by about two yuan, opening at 87 yuan to 84 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e73">Australian Flour Continues to Open at 19 Yuan 78 Cents <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Flour: Yesterday's market was slightly uneven. According to the inquiries from the flour mills, the market price was still 18 yuan. More than 8,000 bags were allocated at fixed quotas by the Fu and Fu factories at parity prices, and the market was as calm as usual. However, the market transactions were mainly based on foreign flour, but the price varied greatly due to the quality and brand. The most common brands on the market are Bell Tower and Flower and Bird, which are the latest arrivals of Australian flour. Yesterday, it was heard that Australian spot flour opened at 19 yuan and 70 cents, and the market price rose to 80 cents, with 6,000-7,000 bags handled by the local brokers. The road cargo transaction is temporarily in a state of abandonment, because the sellers are shouting high, so there is no formal transaction.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday's transaction was as quiet as usual. Japanese factories paid attention to collecting forward wheat, and Chinese factories were waiting for the supply of foreign wheat, resulting in almost no trade in the market. It was heard that the price of Japanese factories was about 28 yuan, and the price of goods in the concession was shouting at 30 yuan, but there was no actual buyer, and the market is afraid that it will be difficult to open up for a while.</p>

<h3 id="e75">Gold Market Turns Stable <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spot gold market's black market fluctuations were narrow. Both buyers and sellers held back, mainly because of little change in foreign exchange rates. Overall, the market slightly trended upward. In the afternoon, gold firms and money exchangers bought in, reaching 5,770 yuan. Later, banks and securities firms searched for more, pushing the price to 5,775 yuan. However, due to the exchange rate firming up in the evening, the market eventually retreated, ending with a gain of 18 yuan, closing at 5,748 yuan. The day's trading was very active, with over 7,000 taels traded. Gold jewelry prices remained unchanged, and customs gold remained flat.</p>
<p>Spot Gold Slightly Trends Upward</p>
<p>In the early morning, the foreign exchange market was quiet, but there were still buyers in the market. The opening price was raised by 10 yuan, with banks and money exchangers buying 20 taels at 5,740 yuan. Soon after, money exchangers continued to buy 30 taels at 5,750 yuan. At this time, gold and silver firms sold a little, causing a pullback of over 10 yuan, with gold firms selling 10 taels to money exchangers at 5,735 yuan. However, soon after, both gold firms and money exchangers bought in, keeping the price very stable. Banks traded 30 taels among themselves, pushing the price up to 5,760 yuan. However, securities firms sold 20 taels to gold firms, slightly lower by 10 yuan at 5,750 yuan. Eventually, due to the foreign exchange market turning firm, there was an undercurrent of bullish sentiment, and buyers were eager, pushing the price up again. Banks sold 30 taels to gold firms, reaching 5,770 yuan. Until the noon close, banks sold 30 taels to securities firms at 5,764 yuan. The market opened in the afternoon with very high confidence. Banks traded 10 taels among themselves at 5,760 yuan. With banks and securities firms searching for more, the price rose to 5,775 yuan, with gold firms buying 30 taels from securities firms. Later, upon hearing that the foreign exchange rate was hardening, speculators came to the market to sell, and another bank also dumped, pushing the price down by over 30 yuan. Banks sold 20 taels to money exchangers at 5,740 yuan. The market managed to hold its ground in the evening, closing at 5,748 yuan, an increase of 18 yuan compared to the previous day's settlement. The daily range was 40 yuan. The spot gold price quoted by gold firms was over 10 yuan higher than the spot gold price, and the buying price was 30 yuan lower. The current standard gold price was 50-60 yuan lower than the quoted gold price, with no trading.</p>
<p>Gold Jewelry Remains Unchanged</p>
<p>The selling price of gold jewelry per tael in gold shops has not changed. Da Tong Heng quoted 590 yuan, and Xin Tong Heng's price was similar, with the buying price around 30 yuan lower.</p>
<p>US Dollar Exchange Rate Fluctuates</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign currency market situation followed the spot gold market, eventually trending slightly upward. The British and American gold pounds also rose slightly by 5 jiao. British gold notes remained unchanged, and the market price was stable. The US dollar exchange rate fluctuated, but the change was very small, eventually rising by 5 fen compared to the previous day. Hong Kong notes resumed trending upward, with the evening price at 4 yuan and 2 fen. Japanese yen notes had balanced supply and demand, and the market price was stable. Korean won notes were in increasing demand, and the market price continued to rise, with the evening price at 1 yuan and 2 jiao 5 fen.</p>
<p>Discount Rate Suddenly Rises Again</p>
<p>The discount rate for exchange bills, which is about to disappear, suddenly rose slightly yesterday. The discount rate rose to 1.5 yuan per 1,000 yuan, with the discount at 1 yuan, an increase of 0.5 yuan compared to the previous day. The money changers' association's interbank lending rate remained unchanged, quoted at 6 fen in both the morning and afternoon markets.</p>

<p>The securities black market weakened yesterday as banks and money firms released a considerable amount of certificated shares for cash delivery, triggering a general release from floating investors. The market price thus universally retreated slightly, and buyer interest was not strong enough to balance the market, leading to slightly flagging confidence. Throughout yesterday morning, Lianhe bought aggressively, totaling 500,000 to 600,000 [yuan], while Hengkang Yitai also had significant demand. Others such as Renchang and the Sixteenth Company also bought, while Lianyi, Xinfu, Shengda, and Runli sold, with Lianyi being the most active, creating a relatively balanced situation. At the noon close, the price was slightly down by two to three jiao. In the afternoon, Lianyi, Xinfu, Shengda, and Runli continued to sell, and buyer interest gradually waned. Zhongyi also sold aggressively, while the Sixteenth Company and Lianhe released slightly. Buyer interest from Xiexing, Yuanshun, Renchang, Hengfu, Jiufeng, Yiqin, and so on was not strong, and the market price continued to weaken. Type E shares were stable, but the result was a uniform pullback of one to two jiao, up to eight jiao. The turnover was 2,300,000 to 2,400,000 yuan. A brief summary is listed below.</p>
<p>Category | Highest | Lowest | Closing | Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>---|---|---|---|---|</p>
<p>Stock Trading: 500 shares of Hanyeping Company stock were traded at a price of 3 yuan and 5 jiao.</p>
<p>Also, the Shanghai Stock Exchange was quite quiet in the early morning. This was because trading this week was sluggish, and both buyers and sellers lacked the need for large positions to settle accounts. However, near the close, selling suddenly intensified, and long-held shares declined rapidly, mostly falling to recently unseen levels. Aside from many unconfirmed rumors, there was no way to deduce the reason for this downturn.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Woolen Mill's offering of new shares by a British company has been detailed in this newspaper. The publicly offered subscription was over forty times oversubscribed (yesterday's report omitted the character "ten," resulting in "four times oversubscribed," and the subheading made the same mistake). The allocation method was publicly announced by Luen Yick &amp; Co. yesterday, with 15 shares allocated to those applying for 500 shares, 25 shares for 1,000 shares, 40 shares for 1,500 shares, and 55 shares for 2,000 shares. 85 shares were allocated to those applying for 3,000 shares. The above shares are scheduled to be auctioned at the Shanghai Stock Exchange next week. (Mao)</p>
<p>London, 5th (Thursday) Dispatch: Today's listed prices for Chinese foreign bonds and Far Eastern commercial company stocks. Chinese foreign bonds remained stable, and only bank stocks in the Far East stocks showed a slight improvement. There were more gains than losses, and the general trend was mostly steady, with only the Tianjin-Pukou Railway's original continuing loan rising by another £1, priced at £15. There were no other changes. Bank stocks: Mercantile Bank shares rose 2 shillings and 6 pence, priced at £7 10 shillings; HSBC Bank's London-registered shares rose £3, priced at £75; Hong Kong-registered shares also rose £2, priced at £78, with quoted prices but no trades. Mercantile Bank shares alone fell 7 shillings and 6 pence, priced at £10 7 shillings and 6 pence, with the rest unchanged.</p>
<h3 id="e77">Yarn and Cotton - Major Players Selling Off - Cotton Yarn Inventory Slightly Loosens <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market has been fluctuating, but is entering a quiet phase. This is because current sales are sporadic, and transactions are still supporting the market. The selling price of 32-count single yarn remains firm. As for foreign exchange, it is also hovering, so the attitude of the remaining groups is also changing and they are beginning to buy. As a result, although major players are selling off, their sales are being absorbed, and the market is thus turning upward. Yesterday, 1,370 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Shuangma brand and Nongkai brand yarn demand is firm and rising. Because the market turned upward the day before, everyone in the market is on the buying side. The opening price was 1,232 yuan. Once this price opened, buying continued strongly, rising directly to 1,236 yuan. Unexpectedly, major players sold off one after another. However, the situation remained in this price range for a long time, showing a strong stance. Then it was heard that the foreign exchange rate was fluctuating at 0.3125, which had no major impact on the overall situation. Due to slightly looser inventory, it fell back to 1,231 yuan a few times. However, the bullish camp was very solid. Part of the profit-taking occurred midway, with low prices reaching 1,227 yuan. However, buyers did not disappear, and the price gradually rose back to 1,233-1,234 yuan at the close. It was found that the total transaction volume for half a day was 5,160 bales, and the market for 20-count Shuangma brand was flat. The amounts bought by each group are listed below:</p>
<p>Spot Cotton Demand is Active</p>
<p>Spot cotton trading is slightly sluggish, but the market is strong. This is because yarn factories have demand, so confidence is strong.</p>
<p>In other news, foreign cotton prices: The New York cotton market rose in the early morning due to speculative buying, but later fell back due to selling by spot traders and profit-taking by some bulls. As a result, the closing price was 3-4 pound notes higher than the previous day. Indian cotton futures fell by a huge 6-7 rupees yesterday.</p>
<p>Trading in imported cotton in Shanghai has gradually become more active recently, but is limited to weavers. Both Chinese and Japanese factories have been buying, and traders' optimism is also increasing, so there is a lot of trading. However, the selling price is certainly not good.</p>
<h3 id="e78">Piece Goods - Cotton Cloth Mill Prices Increase Again <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Mill cloth prices continued to rise yesterday, due to the recent surge in plain and fine cloth from eastern piece goods, boosting confidence. Traders and dyers were relentlessly searching for supplies. Jardine Matheson and Lun Chang mill's bleached and printed cloth prices increased again by 0.5-1 [yuan]. Selling prices for various cloths: coarse cloth and twill increased by 0.1-0.25 yuan per piece, fine cloth, bleached cloth, and dyed cloth increased by 0.25-0.5 yuan. Velvet was priced according to demand. Shortages in various grades caused an increase of about 0.5 yuan per piece. Trading on the street was very active, with over 1,300 pieces traded, Guangdong and Hong Kong traders bought over 300 pieces of colored cloth and bleached cloth, Zhejiang and Fujian traders bought over 200 pieces of colored cloth and colored twill bleached cloth, and traders from Yantai in northern China bought over 100 pieces of 16-pound coarse cloth.</p>
<p>Eastern cloth, white goods, and inland dyed goods continue to sell well. Fine cloth and fine twill increased by 0.3-0.4 yuan per piece. Over 700 pieces were traded on the street. Longtou fine cloth reached a high of 36.1 yuan in the after-market, but closed slightly lower at 35.49 yuan. Sijunzi serge was 1.095 yuan.</p>
<p>Exported cotton cloth: yesterday, 551 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Purchasing Power Gradually Declining - Discounted Woolens Have a Wide Market</p>
<p>The woolen market was in good spirits yesterday, but due to the warm weather, actual sales seemed slightly weaker than the previous week. For standard goods, the selling prices of thick goods and overcoat woolens, regardless of quality, also rose sharply. On the one hand, this gave people the impression that they were unable to afford to buy them. Looking at the inquiries from traders and tailors who have a close relationship, business is worse than in previous years. Aware of this, merchants have found that discounted woolens, which are lower grade and have less wool, are being produced and sold in greater quantities, because they are very suitable for the tastes of ordinary people with limited budgets. Business is very prosperous, and shipments have been increased repeatedly. This is also a phenomenon of adapting to the environment. Yesterday, Zhanghua 918 plain serge was wholesaled at 11.5 yuan per yard, Continental Han Limeng was wholesaled at 13.5 yuan, American Lun Santa Claus Helix was 9.75 yuan, Gongda striped plain wool board was sold at 12.5 yuan, Hualun uniform cloth was 8.25 yuan, Daya discounted straight wool was 1.2 yuan, American Xin discounted shoe cloth was 5.6 yuan, and Yousheng double-sided discounted camel wool was 2.4 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e79">Oil Cake - Japanese Traders Sell Off - Oil Market Plummets <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the futures vegetable oil market trading remained active. Because most rice speculators had achieved their goals in the rice market, they wanted to show their prowess in the oil market as well. Therefore, after the market opened, they continued to aggressively buy, pushing prices up sharply by about two yuan. Unexpectedly, things did not go as planned. In the afternoon, a certain Japanese trading firm suddenly offered a large quantity of crude oil, which immediately reversed market sentiment. Short sellers were greatly encouraged, and selling overwhelmed buying, causing the market to plummet rapidly. As a result, futures prices fell back, while spot prices fluctuated slightly, generally without major changes compared to the previous day. A total of 3,000 barrels of Qingdao crude oil for December delivery and nearly 1,000 barrels for February delivery were traded. Spot transactions included 50 barrels of Dalian soybean oil, 200 dan of Dayou Factory soybean oil, 200 pieces of Jiaozhou crude oil, 150 pieces of Yantai crude oil, and 20 barrels of Qingdao crude oil.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 1,510 cans of crude oil were shipped from Yantai, and 4,600 pieces of soybean cake were shipped to Hong Kong. Today (7th), 500 bags of corn are being shipped to Yantai.</p>

<p>Vermicelli and dried goods have become scarce recently, and winter sales are more active, leading to further price increases. Longkou vermicelli has reached 150 yuan, Qingdao vermicelli is 135 yuan, and Jiangbei vermicelli is cheaper, still selling for 90 yuan. The market is stable.</p>
<h3 id="e81">Sugar Market - Coarse and Refined White Sugar Loosen <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>The sugar market continued to soften as the foreign exchange rate loosened. The association's clearing price for spot 24 coarse white sugar was 73 yuan at the wooden pier, down 0.05 yuan, and 72.5 yuan at the foreign pier, down 0.02 yuan. Spot Dutch red sugar was 56.1 yuan and 0.2 yuan, unchanged. Taikoo refined white sugar B mark was 73.5 yuan at the western pier, down 0.5 yuan, DY mark was 68.8 yuan, HX mark was 68.6 yuan, down 0.4 yuan at the western pier, 68.3 yuan at the eastern pier, winter mist green was 57 yuan, bowl green was 96 yuan. Also, yesterday 150 bags of sugar arrived from Hong Kong.</p>

<p>Old dried jellyfish is considered the best quality, with a crisp texture and excellent flavor. This year's production was reduced, and stocks of old goods have been exhausted, so the selling price of new goods has risen again. Currently, jellyfish skin is selling for 115 yuan, and jellyfish heads are 85 yuan, up 5 yuan from before.</p>
<h3 id="e83">Cuttlefish Stocks Gradually Thin <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Cuttlefish has been continuously sold to customers recently, and stocks have gradually thinned. Also, the source of supply is sparse, so the market is very tight. Currently, Ningbo goods are selling for 100 yuan, Zhoushan goods are 140 yuan, and Yantai cuttlefish is 145 yuan, an increase of 5-10 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e84">Both Chinese and Western Dried Mussels are Expensive <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Supplies of dried mussels, such as those from Ningbo, are intermittent, and top-quality goods are perceived as lacking. Therefore, Grade 3 and 4 mussels have risen to 440 yuan, Ningzi mussels are 410 yuan, and North Road mussels, which are mostly used for digestion, are 390 yuan, an increase of 50-60 yuan compared to the previous market. Other imported goods: Siamese small mussels are selling for 180 yuan, medium mussels are 190 yuan, large mussels are 200 yuan, and exported goods are 220 yuan. Recently, these have also increased by 10 yuan.</p>

<p>Fish maw prices are at their peak due to the small amount of production this year, so they are sold as soon as they arrive, with no accumulation of inventory. Recently sold goods, such as diao pian, cost 590 yuan, gong pian 500 yuan, ti pian 670 yuan, and chang jiao 300 yuan. Looking at the current situation, prices have reached their peak.</p>

<p>According to a Reuters dispatch yesterday, the New York raw silk inventory and sales statistics report showed that US raw silk imports in November were 48,407 bales, an increase of 4,686 bales compared to October. However, US raw silk sales this month were not high, totaling 36,370 bales, a difference of 3,503 bales compared to October, and a sharp decrease of about 1,000 bales compared to the same month last year. Therefore, silk prices fell that day. New York near-term prices fell from 2.61 yuan to 2.48 yuan, and far-term prices fell from 2.60 yuan to 2.51 yuan. Penang spot prices fell from 1,375 yuan to the support price of 1,350 yuan, and far-term prices fell from 1,385 yuan to 1,366 yuan. As for inventory, it increased, with this month's inventory at 60,330 bales, an increase of 12,033 bales compared to October. The market conditions for various silk products in the US market are listed below.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 67 pieces of tea were shipped to Hong Kong, and today (7th), 400 pieces are being shipped to Tianjin.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Metals: Limited Sales of Binding Wire, Prices of Galvanized Iron Sheets Rise Steadily <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Recent trading of binding wire has been sluggish due to stagnant demand from out-of-town merchants in areas like Tianjin, Yantai, Qingdao, and Qinhuangdao. Sales rely solely on small purchases from local iron factories and construction companies, resulting in limited actual sales. Consequently, prices have remained stable without significant increases, with yesterday's price at fifty-two yuan per dan (a unit of weight), and approximately two hundred dan were traded.</p>
<p>Six and seven-foot galvanized iron sheets are experiencing rising prices due to a shortage of raw materials, resulting in limited production. Additionally, local stove factories, galvanized iron workshops, and construction companies are constantly seeking these materials, leading dealers with small amounts of stock to hold out for higher prices, quoting prices two to three jiao higher than before. Seven-foot sheets are priced at nine yuan and three jiao, and six-foot sheets at eight yuan and three jiao.</p>

<h3 id="e88">The Need for Daycare Centers <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>By Mu Zhen</p>
<p>Women with higher education often hope to continue working in society after marriage. However, reality often disappoints them. Once they have children, there is a lack of caregivers at home. Should they entrust the children to servants? They are somewhat uneasy because servants are mostly uneducated and their childcare methods may be unreasonable. If they don't give the children to servants, what should they do? After all, children are their own. Sending children to kindergarten is an option, but kindergarten dismissal times are too early, conflicting with work hours. Moreover, kindergartens generally do not accept children under four years old. So, how should children under four be cared for? This is a major problem for modern women, especially those who rely on dual incomes to support their families.</p>
<p>Many highly educated female university graduates, with rich knowledge, end up burying their decade-plus of education in a small sphere—a household—fulfilling their natural duties. Indeed, they have fulfilled their responsibilities as virtuous wives and good mothers, but they are ultimately confined to a small circle, making their vast knowledge somewhat wasted! Now, to solve the problem of childcare for women serving society, we cannot do without daycare centers. Daycare centers can provide children with appropriate care and natural development. Only then can women serving society work with peace of mind in their careers, while their children receive reasonable care and upbringing.</p>
<p>In the past, there were daycare centers established in Shanghai, but they were small in scale and lacked comprehensive organization, causing parents to feel uneasy. However, establishing a better daycare center requires substantial funds. This is because daycare centers are not profit-making institutions but are intended to benefit the public. Furthermore, competent management is equally important. Therefore, I ultimately hope that people from all walks of life will jointly raise funds to operate daycare centers, benefiting the community by solving the childcare problem for women serving society and securing proper and reasonable care for children.</p>
<p>Editor's Note: In previous discussions in this column on the issue of women's career paths, many authors have raised the need for daycare centers. Addressing the concerns of working women about their families is indeed something that must be addressed. Recently, it was reported that the YWCA is actively planning to establish two daycare centers, which is undoubtedly good news. It is said that a charity sale will be held tomorrow (December 8th) from 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM at 323 Muir Road (intersection of Jing'an Temple Road), organized by the YWCA, with the aim of raising funds for daycare center expenses. We hope that enthusiastic men and women will strive to help them to ensure the success of this endeavor.</p>

<p>Last autumn, I traveled from Shanghai to Shaoguan. When I passed through Hong Kong's Kowloon and arrived at Shayuchong on the edge of Guangdong, I couldn't help but develop a novel and profound impression of Guangdong women. Along the road between Shayuchong and Danshui, I saw thousands upon thousands of load carriers lined up, carrying large boxes of kerosene, cigarettes, matches, various merchandise brought in from Hong Kong, and native products such as paper, tea, and mushrooms exported from the mainland. Among these load carriers coming and going, women made up the majority. I then took a sedan chair from Danshui to Huiyang. While waiting for a boat to Laolong on the Jiang River in Huiyang, the porters, carrying shoulder poles, bustling, scrambling, and pushing like ants to get onto the boat, were also two-thirds women. Some were as old as forty or fifty, some as young as fifteen or sixteen. All were barefoot, with their heads wrapped in square cloths, skin dark and yellow, and bodies so upright. Carrying luggage weighing hundreds of pounds, they walked faster than the unburdened gentlemen and young masters. And as the sun set in the west, they might even sing mountain songs. At this time, looking at their strong and healthy backs from behind and listening to their clear and loud singing, a beautiful picture unfolded before your eyes by the mountains and waters covered in rosy clouds, and the people in the picture were also beautiful. At this time, you, ah, might temporarily forget your lover with permed hair and high heels who remains in your mind!</p>
<p>Some of these female load carriers rely on carrying loads for a living, while others treat it as a side job, aiming to earn extra money to supplement their household income. However, the price of their labor is extremely low. Before the war, carrying a load of luggage from the dock to the hotel only cost one haozi (less than one jiao of national currency). Since the outbreak of the war, partly because prices have soared and partly because of the increase in travelers to the mainland, their asking prices have gradually increased. Each load now requires one jiao to four jiao of national currency. Long-distance carrying, calculated by the mile, costs five jiao per mile. It is said that a load carrier can earn an average of one and a half yuan per day because they can walk seventy to eighty miles a day. However, this kind of business is not available every day. Moreover, in addition to carrying loads, they also have to bear all other labor-intensive tasks at home and raise their children! Some of them have lost their husbands, some have husbands with low incomes, and some have husbands who have gone abroad, so their income is almost entirely used to support their families. With the price of rice soaring to seventy or eighty yuan today, the austerity of their lives can be imagined.</p>
<p>These female load carriers are not only strong but also quite courageous. The work of carrying loads at the front lines is also mostly carried out by them. During intense work, their wide-brimmed straw hats are sometimes hit by one or two bullets, but their attitude is very calm. In their eyes, bullets are like small stones, not worth paying attention to. From their work achievements and their large, intelligent eyes, we can also know that they are not only strong and brave but also have high innate abilities. Unfortunately, they lack educational opportunities, and almost ten out of ten are illiterate, so they labor like cattle and horses all year round, living lives similar to cattle and horses.</p>
<p>Seeing the female load carriers of Guangdong, I can't help but think of the issue of women's employment. In cities, aren't there still some gentlemen and young masters who oppose women's employment? Even last year, the post office had a controversy over a decision not to recruit female employees. The reason they hold is, of course, nothing more than the principle of men managing external affairs and women managing internal affairs. However, these female load carriers can freely engage in carrying loads as a profession in the countryside, and no one opposes them. What is the reason for this? Here, it can only be left to the gentlemen and young masters to answer themselves.</p>

<p>The Veranda of the Hanging Rainbow is a famous scenic spot outside the East Gate of Songling. In springtime, the beautiful scenery is like a painting. On the embankment, willow catkins flutter in the wind like smoke or mist, reflecting the verdant spring water. Everything above and below is a jade green, dotted with the crimson blossoms of peach trees and the delicate white flowers of plum trees. One cannot help but feel the brilliance and richness, as if Heaven deliberately exhibits its creative power, developing the beauty of spring and embroidering this bright scene on the earth, allowing the scholars and maidens who cherish the spring scenery to feast their eyes, broaden their minds, and delight their senses. Even the little birds in the forest are flying up and down, chirping endlessly, singing the praises of the earth's springtime colors. The sun has already passed noon. On the river, there is a painted boat with cassia oars and magnolia paddles, gently floating on the green waves. The boatman is poling, and the boat girl is rowing, both wearing joyful expressions on their faces. In the front cabin, exquisite and delicate betel nut wooden chairs are lined up on both sides, and several women and young servants are sitting on them, watching the people in the middle cabin, as if they are attending to them. In the middle cabin, several men and women are sitting, laughing and cheerfully drinking wine and composing poems. In the center sits a scholar over fifty years old, wearing a scholar's cap and gown, with a short beard on his chin and a spirited and handsome appearance, waving a gilded paper fan with a spring breeze on his face. Beside him sit a pair of flower-like sisters. The one on the left is about eighteen or nineteen years old, with cloud-like hair, bright eyes, and white teeth, possessing an oval face, which is very well-proportioned and fair, with cheeks as dazzling as peach blossoms, glowing with light. She wears a light red shirt, and has curved eyebrows and a small waist, slender and graceful, like a person in a painting. The one on the right is still young, but she also has eyebrows like spring mountains and eyes like autumn waves, revealing gentleness, charm, intelligence, and nothing vulgar. On the table are many fine wines and delicious dishes. The scholar sitting in the middle, stroking his short beard with one hand and waving his folding fan with the other, said to the two with a smile, "The ancients said: 'If you don't do useless things, how can you spend your finite life?' I live in seclusion in this countryside, where flowers and birds delight the heart, and music cultivates the mind. I don't want to go back to the officialdom to mingle again. Life is only a hundred years long, so when will one need wealth and honor? Why should I be with oxen and horses in the same stable, and chickens and ducks scrambling for food? The most precious things in the world are heroic figures, famous scholars, and beautiful women. I know that although I don't have the talent to assist a king, my pen is no less capable than Jiang Lang, who once had a dream that made his pen produce flowers. In the years since I retired from public life, I have only been composing poems to entertain myself. Although I cannot achieve the joy of Wangchuan, I know that among the famous scholars of Songling, who else is there but me? What is gratifying is that you, the talented and beautiful, green and red-hearted Liu sisters, are often by my side,娇憨linghui, like little birds clinging to people, no different from flowers that understand words and grass that relieves worries. Whenever I see your beautiful faces, all my worries immediately disappear. I imagine that the two Qiaos of Jiangdong back then could not monopolize the heavens at the beginning. They can be called peerless beauties. How could this be accidental?" The younger one listened and giggled, saying, "We are all mediocre people, fortunate to meet Master Zhang who does not abandon our humble status, teaching us to read and write, and to compose poetry. To have such a good teacher is truly rare." The scholar smiled and said, "Jiang Zi, although you are young, you are very diligent. Although you are not as good as your sister in calligraphy and poetry, you are also a promising talent, whose future cannot be limited. I will look for a good young man to be your matchmaker, okay?" After saying that, he laughed heartily, revealing a very pleased look. (2)</p>

<h3 id="e93">The Story of the Great Man "Edison" <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>— Paul</p>
<p>Thomas Edison spent his childhood in hardship and entered adulthood, but difficulties and obstacles still did not leave him. When he left Boston and arrived in New York, he was experiencing the pain of bankruptcy. He carried a package of books between his less-than-tidy clothes, which even aroused the suspicion of the police and caused them to fire a warning shot.</p>
<p>He arrived in New York to work at his Uncle Byers' place, but he was not a talent for sweeping the office, so whenever he had a chance, he would pick up his beloved books and study them, and in his spare time, he would conduct electrical experiments.</p>
<p>He was determined to see Mr. Teager, the director of the Gold Indicator Bureau. He was repeatedly embarrassed by being turned away. The opportunity finally came one day. When the price of gold was fluctuating, the machine unexpectedly broke down. When no one could repair it and everyone was in a panic, Edison stepped forward and immediately repaired the machine. In the meeting with Qin Jiade and General Bao Hui'er, he obtained their agreement to start manufacturing a more perfect gold reporting machine.</p>
<p>On his first day of work, he happened to encounter a great storm. When he arrived at the entrance of the Western Union Factory, he encountered a beautiful young woman—Miss Mary Stilwell. Her umbrella was turned inside out by Edison, so his first job was to repair the umbrella.</p>
<p>Because the young woman's workplace was on the floor above Edison's factory, she worked at the Cash Dong Telegraph Chain Plate Factory and understood Morse code. When he repaired the umbrella and returned it to its owner, he could not help but be imprinted with her beautiful and lovely image. However, he had no money, so he could not accept her request to go out for dinner together. However, they ended up meeting in a restaurant. Edison only ate an apple pie and a glass of fresh milk, but Mary ate a full meal. As a result, the only dime in Edison's pocket was not enough to pay the bill. Fortunately, Mary adapted to the situation and threw a gold coin from her purse, pretending that Edison had dropped it. This small loan was repaid by Edison when he received his first month's salary. After that, they began to interact with each other, and their love gradually grew.</p>
<p>With day and night efforts and the cooperation of various workers, the desired machine was finally successful. Edison received a reward of forty thousand yuan. He returned to the factory and used an iron pipe that he usually used to send a Morse telegram to his lover. The telegram was so explosive that his colleagues listened intently with bated breath.</p>
<p>"Forty thousand yuan, I want to set up my own factory."</p>
<p>That reply said, "I knew you would do that, Tom." Unexpectedly, he then sent the code "Will you marry me?" and the response was not unexpected. So a cooperative man and woman embraced in front of many colleagues.</p>
<p>The experimental laboratory in Menlo Park was then established, and Edison also enjoyed a beautiful family life in his spare time from work. In his laboratory, he invented more than a thousand things, but he also experienced several emergencies that brought him to the brink of bankruptcy. When he had no other choice, he had to retreat to a hiding place.</p>
<p>Before the invention of the light bulb, when he was in financial straits, he even had to dismiss all the workers, but they were still willing to work, which unintentionally gave him the inspiration to manufacture the phonograph. On a certain evening, his voice was released from the wax disc.</p>
<p>Among Edison's various inventions, the light bulb is the greatest, requiring the most time and energy, and suffering the most failures. In the end, he was successful. The first light bulb continued to burn for forty hours, and many workers excitedly waited to see the light that had never existed in the world.</p>
<p>The difficulties had not been completely overcome. Qin Jiade was also a powerful opponent because he owned many gas stocks. However, no matter how difficult things were, with strong perseverance, he was eventually able to succeed. Edison also laid the electrical wires for the entire city of New York within the limited time of six months and set up a perfect power plant. Before the lighting ceremony, there was also an accident that caused damage. As a result, at 3:00 PM on Monday, September 4, 1882, the light shone on the entire city of New York. Mr. Teager's face was also hit by an overly excited person and covered with a hat.</p>

<p>— Ju Zichun</p>
<p>I feel very fortunate that I was able to see the childhood life of the great inventor Edison on the screen.</p>
<p>Edison grew up in a family that was not economically wealthy. Although he had a loving mother and a lively and lovely younger sister who sympathized with him, his father was so rude and strict. Because he liked to use chemical medicines as toys, he often caused trouble; when his father found out, he would be beaten or severely scolded. Later, he was even expelled from school for causing trouble. After that, his father hated him even more, not giving him money to buy books, nor sending him to school. However, Edison was not disappointed. He enlarged his courage and struggled with the environment. He relied on his own efforts and finally obtained the permission of the stationmaster of the railway station to start his telegraph business in a small place on the train.</p>
<p>Edison worked hard. He copied and arranged the news he heard, quickly printed it into newspapers and sold them, and the sales were not bad. He earned some money from this, and he used these hard-earned rewards to buy books to read. Therefore, after each spring flower and autumn wind, after each long summer and severe winter, there would always be a few new books added to his bookshelf. Although he could not go to school, this did not obliterate his spirit of reading.</p>
<p>While Edison was working as a news vendor, he continued his experimental work. Once, he mixed a kind of explosive, almost causing a fire in the train. The stationmaster was furious and threw away all his medicines and gave him a slap in the face, driving him off the train.</p>
<p>Poor Edison failed again. His most beloved medicines were thrown away, his ears were deafened, and he was trapped in a difficult environment. People did not give him sympathy or pity. On the contrary, batches of sarcasm and ridicule, like cold arrows, were thrown at him mercilessly. But our great inventor did not give up at all, and struggled forward. The more difficult the environment, the more determined his mind, making him more motivated, carrying a happy heart to complete his wish.</p>
<p>"Young Edison" is really too moving for me. It not only made me shed tears of sympathy, but also gave me courage and enthusiasm. I deeply feel that: if we want to break out a bright road from a bad surrounding, we will definitely suffer many tortures. We must break through difficulties and rely on our own efforts. We must have the determination to improve and the spirit of struggle. If things fail, we should not be sad or discouraged in vain. We must continue to persevere and struggle with the environment, then success often follows failure. Finally, we must also have a warm hope and a happy mood. Without hope, we will not work hard at all; without happiness, we cannot create everything.</p>
<p>When I write this article under the light of the electric lamp, I cannot help but think of the gifts given to us by this great inventor; his success has changed the lives of all mankind. However, let us not forget that this great inventor was tempered by hardship. Today, when we commemorate him, the most important thing is that we should learn from him the spirit of self-reliance and work hard to create a great cause for the benefit of the country and the people!</p>
<h3 id="e95">Reading "Young Edison" Essay Manuscript <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Baiyi</p>
<p>Although the prize for the "Young Edison" essay contest has a profound meaning, it cannot be said to be very generous. It is indeed a difficult task to be selected within the top ten among thousands of people. However, there are still many brave young men and women and modern parents among the readers of Shen Bao who resolutely and enthusiastically participated in this competition. This courage and spirit are very admirable; at the same time, it also shows the positive impact of this competition on society.</p>
<p>A total of 4,543 manuscripts were received, including 2,232 from the parents' group. Because it is necessary to watch the film first before writing, there are such results under such an invisible and unavoidable restriction, which is already very successful.</p>
<p>Edison's childhood is indeed worthy of praise. If there were no various encounters in his childhood, he would never be able to endure the repeated failures in his adulthood; if there were no perseverance developed in his childhood, he would never have produced his rich achievements in his adulthood.</p>
<p>From the essay manuscripts, I have experienced the outpouring of true feelings, the boiling of enthusiasm, and the resonance of the soul: I have observed beautiful writing, sincere sentences, and firm will. The lazy young people regret their past and start their efforts in the future; strict fathers despise their masks and show a lovely smile; loving mothers celebrate their sincere love and unwavering beliefs; and the general public believes that "Young Edison" is a beautiful work with a great impact on society, and places ardent expectations on the Chinese film industry.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, every participant has sympathized with Edison's childhood circumstances and shed hot tears. The deep impression is no different from a milestone worth commemorating on everyone's life journey. Looking at a large pile of letters, it is like watching a large group of hopeful young people who have received the correct enlightenment and are advancing towards a bright future. How can one not be excited and moved!</p>
<p>In general, every essay manuscript is excellent. However, due to the limitation of the number of awards, a selection process had to be carried out. However, while the winners are worthy of joy, the losers do not have to be disappointed. In fact, young people with the spirit of Edison should not know the word disappointment. Because the greatest motivation for this essay is to promote and carry forward the spirit of Edison, to make modern youth as the basis for self-cultivation, the basic service to society, and to enable modern parents to adopt the correct methods to nurture the talents of the country. The setting of prizes is nothing more than to enliven the market.</p>
<p>If Mr. Edison were still alive, he would definitely approve of this essay contest.</p>

<p>— Huang Zixiang</p>
<p>I haven't been to the cinema for a long time. This time, it was Fen's treat. She bought the tickets in advance, giving me the opportunity to go to the magnificent and splendid Dahua to see "Young Edison."</p>
<p>When we came out, Fen walked with me, heading west along Jing'an Temple Road.</p>
<p>"Xiang, you are Tom, and I am Danny. We are all on the same path."</p>
<p>"Really? Am I worthy? - The great Edison, I am only worthy of worshiping him."</p>
<p>"Isn't that so? - Edison said to his sister on the road that he wanted to be Washington and Franklin? Haven't you told me that before? Xiang, I see that you seem a little颓唐 lately, so I specially invited you to watch this film. 'Shun is a man, and I am also a man;' Edison is certainly worthy of our worship, but even more worthy of our emulation. To be honest, his environment at the time was not better than yours now: he was expelled from school, beaten by his father, ridiculed and abused by the people of the whole town, and even considered mentally deranged, behaving abnormally - a madman. However, although he felt severe mental pain, he still pursued knowledge everywhere to satisfy his innate curiosity. He resolutely struggled with the environment, doing hard work and being a vendor - when I saw him flattering and giving cigarettes and newspapers to the guests in the train, while buying books one by one, I was so moved that I shed tears."</p>
<p>"Yes, I also shed tears. My several old books and pirated books were almost bought in this way."</p>
<p>"That's right, so I said you are Tom. Although what you like is literature. Furthermore, I learned that the reason why Edison was able to succeed as a great scientist who contributed to human culture is not entirely due to his heavy curiosity and agile thinking, but mostly due to his broad human love. People ridiculed him, laughed at him, and beat him, but what he answered to people was always sincere service and a pure and innocent love. When the telegraph operator at the station disliked his restlessness and drove him away, he risked his own life to save a girl who was in the care of the operator from under the train. When the Civil War broke out, he published a newspaper to support Lincoln, who was fighting for justice. When the people of the whole town refused to give him work and instead laughed at him and scolded him, he volunteered to use the train's whistle to save a train of passengers who were about to be killed, most of whom were relatives and friends of those who laughed at him and scolded him. Without this kind of human love that repays evil with good, there would be no great figures in the world. Xiang, you often tell me stories about Tolstoy's novels, and you should definitely see this point more clearly than I do."</p>
<p>"Oh - but you forgot another point."</p>
<p>"What?" Fen looked at me suspiciously, and her footsteps almost stopped.</p>
<p>"I think that most of Edison's human love was given to him by his mother. If there were no such discerning and loving mother to comfort him in his pain and encourage him in his despair, I doubt whether we would have the fortune to enjoy the gifts of this great scientist today. Motherly love is great, as great as the great achievements of the great scientist. However -"</p>
<p>"However, you have lost your mother, so you feel that life is lonely? Xiang, we -"</p>
<p>Fen didn't go on, but her eyes turned red.</p>
<p>At this time, we had reached the trolley station at the intersection of Seymour Road, and everyone stopped. I took Fen's hand, smiled warmly, and said:</p>
<p>"Fen, don't worry, I have a Danny, and that's enough. I haven't wavered, I'll listen to you, I want to be Tom. - Thank you for inviting me to watch this film -"</p>
<p>I said goodbye to Fen in excitement. In the car, I was lost in thought. When the kind and respectful image of the mother appeared in my mind, I unconsciously took off the hat on my head, and at the same time, I almost heard a burst of warm applause.</p>
<h3 id="e97">"Young Edison" Essay Contest Parent Group First Place <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Zhaohua</p>
<p>The MGM Company's "Young Edison" film gives us a lot of enlightenment on parental education.</p>
<p>First: Parents should center on children's interests, cultivate them as much as possible, and develop their strengths. Edison liked to study natural science since he was a child. Although his father treated him very strictly, he still allowed him to have many bottles and jars and chemical medicines in a small room downstairs. Edison could concentrate on playing his favorite scientific tricks in the room without being interfered by adults. His later contributions to mankind may not have originated from this.</p>
<p>Second, parents should encourage children to live independently. When Edison was in his teens, he left home and sold newspapers and candies on the train alone. His parents were actually willing to let this young son stay away from their knees. This point is very worthy of attention. We should not treat our children as private property and forever confine them within the family. On the contrary, we should cultivate children's independent personality and gradually develop their interests outside the family. When they grow up, they can devote themselves to society and not suffer from leaving home.</p>
<p>Third: Children's grades in school can only represent a superficial evaluation. Edison's grades in school were very bad. The teacher even thought he was unpromising. His father was also very disappointed because of this. But in fact, Edison was not only not stupid as his teacher said, but he was an extremely clever genius. It can be seen that there are many reasons for children's failure in school, and stupidity is not the only factor. Therefore, if the children's grades are not good, parents do not have to be discouraged, let alone angry. They should further study the reasons why the grades are not good and then take appropriate measures.</p>
<p>Fourth: To change children's habits, scolding is not an effective method. Edison liked to put his hands in his pockets, but his father didn't like this, so he was repeatedly scolded. But Edison's habit was never changed. Here, the director of the "Young Edison" film pointed out a common and most ineffective disease that parents easily commit.</p>
<p>Fifth: Children's thoughts are sometimes more precise and reasonable than adults. Edison came up with the method of using mirrors to reflect and increase the light, and he also came up with the method of using steam whistles to send telegrams. These were all problems that adults could not solve at the time. Edison breathed a sigh of relief for many children. Therefore, although children's ages are naive, their opinions are worthy of respect and should not be ignored.</p>
<p>Sixth: It seems that "kindness" is more important than "strictness" for parents to treat their children. Edison's father was a typical "strict father". Edison did not dare to look his father in the eye at ordinary times, nor did he dare to say a word more in front of his father. Later, he even ran away privately. How unfortunate this is. If his father could treat his son with the attitude of a "loving mother", wouldn't the harmonious family life be more tasteful?</p>
<p>Seventh: Although Edison's father was a little too strict, when he learned that Edison had saved the lives of the entire train, he realized the mistake of his past observations and changed his attitude. This spirit of daring to correct mistakes is also worthy of every parent to emulate. In general, people often hold the view that "there are no wrong parents in the world", and their prejudices are deep, persistent to the end, and absolutely unwilling to admit their mistakes in front of their children. This is really the biggest mistake.</p>

<p>"Young Edison" and "Great Man Edison" are not only of great significance for education, but also have a great relationship for the promotion of family and social happiness. This newspaper has jointly organized the essay contest with MGM and Dahua Cinema. The results are good, which shows that this move is valued by all walks of life and is really valuable to hold. It is hoped that in the future, our domestic film companies will produce equally great products to the world, and this newspaper is also happy to cooperate to contribute. In addition, today's newspaper will suspend "Entertainment Circle" for one issue due to space reasons. Hope readers pay attention.</p>

<p>— Humorous</p>
<p>The great inventor Edison invited guests to visit his new home. The house was for summer use, and the architecture was very exquisite. All kinds of equipment that could save manpower were also complete. However, there was a revolving gate that was very clumsy and had to be pushed hard to open. After the guests pushed the door in one by one, one guest suddenly asked: "All the equipment in your house is very good, but why is that strange gate alone like this?" The host looked around and said with a smile: "Thank you all, whoever can turn this door will have drawn eight gallons of water for me and stored it in my rooftop pool!"</p>
