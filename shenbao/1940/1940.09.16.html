<h3 id="c10">日趨積極的美國遠東政策 <a href="#c10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>隨著越南局勢的緊張，美國的遠東政策亦益趨於積極，除赫爾發布了關切越南現勢的談話而外，美政府更對於禁止廢鐵出口加以考慮，並進行關島中途島的設防與夏威夷防禦工事的加強。據美海軍人士表示：關島將成為太平洋之直布羅陀，諾克斯海長則聲稱決使珍珠港成為太平洋最強堡壘；同時，羅斯福總統雙於十三日擴大禁運範圍，禁飛機與臣擎圖樣及製造汽油設備與售與外人。溯自去年七月廿六日宣佈廢止美日商約以來，美國對遠東的種種運用適與遠東大局的惡化成正比例而發燕尾服，縱然最近南太平洋的動亂中心已由舉世屬目的荷印移到以對華戰爭和軸心關係煙幕下的越南，但美國並未為所矇蔽，反而愈益促進其積極關切。</p>
<p>自前次歐戰結束以迄於今，美國之於遠東始終保持其一貫而堅定的基調，並以維護太平洋的均勢，保障中國領土主權完整為根本要義，最近九年來由種種國際事變所激起的反應，均足以使人深切認識美國的立場和決心。但是那些年中不幸外乏國際與國的協調，內有孤立主張相掣肘，加以過分信賴軍縮條約與非戰協定，而在國際軍備競賽中無形落後；致其行動上的表現乃不盡興其維護正議秩序的決意相副，這也就是侵略國家明知美國傳統國策所在而竟悍然無所顧忌的原因。以此之故，乃至進而誤會美國立場，以為不妨餌以其言，示以小惠，即可使之動搖；並認為藉令此種辦法未必即能緩和兩國關係，而那些書面抗議，口頭遣責，竟不妨直以既成事實相答覆。然而在事實上，善於容忍的人，往往恰是最富於行動能力的人；一旦容忍超過了限度，立刻會轉化為無比的偉力；這一現象，正是年來美國遠東政策的寫照。自一九三八年十二月的強硬通牒民主遲遲不見效果而後，美即一變持重為堅決，種種有力的重大措施，自禁運以至擴軍，均相繼著著實現。往昔僅托空言的抱負，於今已逐步見之於實際行動，這實足以振奮世人觀感，並對侵略行動加以事實的切實警告。</p>
<p>但是任何有力有效措施的運用，第一需要把握住最恰當的事機。即如禁運廢約等項，如非遲至今茲始付實施，大概遠東野火當不致蔓延若此。已往阻撓著美國國策運用的孤立份子，已使整個世界付出了不小的代價。最近此輩勢力已見削減，報章文告中也不大看見那種獨善自保的褊淺言論：但少數保守者流，卻至今仍頑守其壁壘，試玩味羅斯福總統關於英美交換軍艦及根據地談話，表示須假此輩時日俾其完全消化，可見上述阻力，仍舊是存在著的。另一方面，亦有些美國人士又不免過份誇張來自歐洲的威脅，把援助英國和大西洋的防衛看成美國當前最主要的任務，反而看輕迫大眉睫的遠東危機。這兩種力量的存在，客觀上幾乎等於美國遠東政策之癌；同時，也適予侵略者以騰挪的機會，最近赫爾一再申述美國對荷印與越南的決意，其迄不足以阻止南海風波的繼續惡化者，小部分是美國內部牽掣孔多，更值大和選將近，益被認為別有所作為；主要的則因為英德間的苦戰方吸引著美方注意力，預料在英德決戰未見分曉之前，美在遠東殆難出於更進一步的有力措施。而美方已往在遠東所運用的經濟與政治的武器實施，無形中增加了受者的惰性，使其習焉而不察；倘使是以其總和於適當時機予以運用，其效果當大不同。當然，這在洞察機微的人，必能了解美國本意，絕非僅藉此予以刺激，或警告而已；但就功效而論，則在實施其堅定政策的步驟和方式上，實有再加考慮的必要。</p>
<p>於此，乃不能不深致慨於已往英美法蘇在遠東有共同行動的機會，竟因種種牽掣而一無成就。現在法國已無能為力，英亦自顧不暇；所餘美蘇二大勢力，其對於遠東危局所負責任已遠較以往加重；而二者間的協調卻至今仍乏良好效果，如果不是中國在極端艱困中竭力堅定支撐，正不難想像今日遠東將成何種景象。茲於美國遠東政策日趨積極之餘，願更向賢明的美當局致其進一步的期望：英德戰事非一朝可決，其分曉有類俟河之清，而南太平洋的危機則已迫眉睫，再不能任其自然發展，幸勿過分偏重歐局以致錯過使遠東撥亂反正的有效時機。第二，安定遠東的種種辦量現在正不相聯擊的存在著，如任其自然，將予侵略者以各個擊破的機會，美國於此應該負起積極責任，結成遠東反侵略戰線，使沒有任何空隙可資侵略者利用。第三，一切經濟政治以至軍事武器的運用，都需要動如脫兔，當機立斷，而且應以總的解決代替枝節節的應付。第四，對於落後的保守意識，和謬誤見解，只應設法克服，不宜過分遷就，如果說在大選當中非迎合人民的固陃見解不能獲勝，則有如羅斯福這樣的人物當不至如此斤斤於得失而以國家前途為　狗。吾人深信倘使在各方面都能運用得宜，遠東問題的解決並不一定取決於太平洋的海軍決戰，但如果一味因循坐誤，任聽侵略者佔有先著，那到真有促使戰爭爆發的最大可能。</p>

<p>德人顯已在從事最大之準備、以圖侵略英倫、且已處於大規模海戰之前夜、而即欲於構成吾國重要防線之海中發動大戰、此時之情勢、已非僅屬一種虛張聲勢之恫嚇、且成為將於數日內趨於實質化之威脅、戰爭之範圍將擴展至數百英裏、各種形式之戰具、如戰鬥艦·驅逐艦·巡洋艦·摩托船·駁船·潛艇、甚或可由海中駛入陸地之天空中者、則為轟炸機及戰鬥機在英倫海峽兩岸者、則為無數以前所未曾應用之巨炮、凡此種種均將出現、而肆其毀滅工作、英國之巨炮將直對向英倫游泳過來之怪物瞄凖、而德國之巨炮則將毀壞構成堅強壁壘而使敵人不能登陸之沿海防禦工事、此一戰爭、將形成有史以來所未見之戰爭、其結局不但關係英國本國之自由、且關係其將來在歐洲之勢力、而英國之不可征服性即為此種勢力之重要原素、此時欲預言其結果、誠為愚　、余今所言即海峽之此一方面（即指英國）人人均具</p>
<p>泰然之自信力</p>
<p>予絕未見一人、表現惶恐、以為德人能以在大炮坦克車輔助其兵士登陸而得在此島建立其根基者、英人此種鎮靜、或可謂係由於長久之經歷史及回念過去侵略英倫者皆歸失敗所致、然此不過為一種陳列而非牢不可破者、須知吾人現時係處於科學之時代、當科學落於為惡者之手中、則吾人殊不能知其將造成何種罪惡、普通之英人、恐不致為災害所驚恐、且感覺希特勒已給與吾人以獲取勝利之最後機會、若希特勒於此番大戰失敗、則彼方便遭受一</p>
<p>至不幸之打擊</p>
<p>矣、昔日之拿破倫、亦會有不改冒險之時、然拿破倫曾親臨陣地、察觀情勢而後始決定停止突進、邱吉爾認希特勒係在效法拿破倫、希特勒刻尚未從事於任何其所不能成就之企圖、此種情形、或即希特勒之莫斯科也、然事之結果、尚難預料、吾人今尚不知希特勒究將用何種新計劃以助其渡海、所謂「秘密武器、」吾人亦未知悉、予今日所能言者、即英國人民將堅強戰鬥以保衛其母國耳、（十五日合眾社電）</p>

<p>下面是美國「生活」圖書週報訪員的報告：</p>
<p>法國不是在四十三天以內被征服、而是在四十三天以內崩潰。法國人自己打敗自己、這點他們自己也明白。</p>
<p>法國所遭遇的，正是十年以來法國社會政治歷史的應有結果，如果恍惚迷離的新聞少一點，世人對於這次　驚的事件，或許早有準備，不　如聞睛天霹靂。所以在這方面，多少有些內奸裏應外合的意味在內。</p>
<p>法國人民，大體上都是善良份子，不守也許太文了些，太注意飲食健談了些，竟忘記了怎樣去工作。化上兩個鐘頭進一午餐仍為結局到來，還是如此。正如一位老太太所說：「我們對於這可怕的事件，都負有責任。法國需要一個教訓，但這次教訓，卻是最殘酷不過了。」法國人現在受罰的最重要的罪惡，是他們長期容忍愚蠢，腐敗昏庸無望的官僚主持政　。</p>
<p>法國最後的崩潰開始於六月九日政府退出色黎之時。道德上，經濟上，與軍事上解體之迅速及範圍之廣　，極為可驚。差不多有兩星期，我們不聽到再有人提起德軍。所能聽見的，只是許多悲人尤人的指斥，說明失敗誰應　其入咎。軍隊對於人民，政府，官吏，都覺討厭。人民對於軍隊，政府官吏也覺同樣討厭。政府與官吏顯然只顧自己，只想逃生的方法。每一個都　懶心灰，憤恕若狂，預料形勢日趨險惡。</p>
<p>各方報告都承認法國陸軍將校，有負於他們的士兵，也有負他們的國家。我們曾見到無數將校參雜於難民之間，撤退他們的妻子與家屬。我們從都爾起，沿路也見到難民中混有敗兵，士兵帶著家族，軍用車上載著平民。</p>
<p>我們極情楚的印象，就是巴黎陷落後，不曾有一激戰。我們實際上已看不到傷兵，這顯然說明德國進展很速。以參戰的軍隊人數為比例，死傷的數目少到駭人聽聞。轟炸同是一種可怕的手段，但比之上次大戰的不斷猛烈的炮擊，充具量也不過兒童的遊戲而已。在難民逃亡的路上，並無機關槍的掃射，只有幾次重事目標的被轟炸。除開法國北部軍用路上，有若幹難民被殺外，並不聽到什麼德軍可怖的消息。</p>
<p>法軍　到背城借一，然後作戰，不過是一種神話。法國大部分軍隊卻曾堅苦作戰，幾千個法國將校也是忠勇可靠。但法國陸軍號稱世界最良的軍隊之說，業已成為一種幻想了。個人的懈怠，並不如一般所說，是民主政治的表現，正是散漫無準備的表現。軍隊無準備，軍火無準備，當局更無準備。前線的士氣確屬激昂，但大兵團一旦開始崩潰，就是一發不可收拾了。</p>
<p>記者不相信色當區高拉普所率第九軍的全軍覆沒，是一種例外。五個月前，第九軍軍官已講起軍紀困難問題了。該軍潰散後，各將校即紛紛返家撤退家族，士兵則徒步奔逃。後來在巴黎咖啡館內找著的有六百名士兵。據未證實消息，這些士兵中，六個中間，即有一個被槍決，並有好多軍官同時槍決。又據最後消息，高拉普現已返巴黎寫他的回憶錄，他及類似他這樣軍官的撤退，據人推測，是乘了運　汽車逃走的。</p>
<p>民心的渙散首先出現於　國北部，北部若幹工業區中，工人天明醒來，發覺民政長官司，工廠經埤，及豪門大族均已連夜逃走一空，其中並有一個村長，扣留了一節火車，把全村的居民，都載往巴黎。</p>
<p>至巴黎慌亂的撤退，開始於六月九日。指示居民撤退，只須兩項手續：一項是無線電的指示，說明撤退到什麼地方去與怎樣達到那地方；一項是警察維持路上秩序。但這兩項都沒有辦到。法國無線電應該不斷努力約束輕信謠言的民眾遷移的時候，卻在播送跳舞音樂，及一再播送過時的政府公報。結果法國民眾的精神完全頹喪，好幾天內，法國全國人民，一半在逃難，　有一半在觀望。這些觀望的人後來也自制不住，也　了鋪蓋，走上逃亡之途，但茫茫不知向何處逃去，也不知為什麼原因而逃。這逃亡的一群，使鄉間的食物　嚼一空，尤其重要的，是　成汽油的恐慌。到了最後，軍政當局才下令禁止難民出境，把一切毫無意義的運輸停止，這樣的運輸，已在好多區域內，使軍事行動，發生了障礙。</p>
<p>法國政府，突在六月十四日全聞搬往波爾多，其特殊的景象，是肥胖的參議員乘著絲絨裏子的汽車，帶著嫵媚的女人，在幾裏路長的難民後面，要求搶到汽油站去加油。</p>
<p>法國在戰前並沒有團結，相信在戰爭中已團結起來的也非事實。在相反方面，好多聰明的法國人記為戰爭是一個很壞的東西，與其法國戰勝而致貧困，毋寧維持一繁榮而居於弱國的地位。這就是參加慕尼克會議者的主張，也就是這一批人統治法國，一直到今年三月。幾百萬的法國工人，受了馬克思主義的洗禮，更無在法國作戰的理由。對和平消息的反響完全是怨尤欲絕的慘痛。一個士兵會慷慨的說：「我們領導的人全是兔子心肝。」</p>
<p>六月二十一日，在巴容納地方，只要放一槍，就要造成血肉模糊的一團。那城市中擠滿了國內外的肥胖的逃難人，並有著大汽車與漂亮女人。從吉爾堡救出的法國軍隊，剛在登陸，形容憔悴，饑餓不堪。英國空軍先遺隊也　湧人城，以便撤回英國。葡萄牙領事館已被包圍得水　不通，須派幾個兵，負槍守住門口。一言以蔽之，景易象慘淡可怕。實為美國人所不能想像其萬一。</p>
<p>下面是一個法國人寫給「生活」圖畫報的一封信：</p>
<p>鄙人讀貴報關於法國情形所發表的報告，深覺貴報通信員已經做到許多記者所自認為應做的事了，就是僅從他個人的觀察獲得結論，而不與別人的觀察獲得結論，而不與別人的觀察來對照。法國年來政客們的腐敗不堪，確是絕對真實的，沒有一個法國人可加以否認。我是以一個生長在法國家庭中的人的資格來講話，我的家庭仍在法國，且與法國政府有關係。有一事不可忘記的，就是法國人被一個強有力的人如樸恩楷萊等人總毫不容情地批評著說，他們是侵略者，　武者，殘忍者，復仇者與不合作者，反之，如荏弱無能的白裏安與白魯姆等人登臺，英美兩國人卻讚揚法國自由主義，盡恭維的能事。</p>
<p>我在幾星期前接到法國幾封來信，證明法國人並非腐敗的民族，但是失去幻想的民族。他們並不如貴報記者所說，卻沒有忘記了怎樣工作，並且仍在盡力工作。我的七十歲的母親，當我寫信請他來美時，她回信說：「請你不必再作此想吧。我在法國有工作可做，我對難民還能盡救濟的任務時，我仍得留在法國。」我還有一們胞姊曾在巴黎兵營廚房裏，每日工作至早上兩點鐘，也曾以同樣的態度，寫信給我。他們兩人都沒有忘記怎樣工作。他們正是無數法國人的代表中心呀。</p>
<p>從法國北部撤退下來的車子，載著遇難的兒童屍體，那才是使法國人氣短的事，但並非法國多數人的腐敗使法國崩潰。在這一時期，法國人正城垛要世界各國人的瞭解與同情呢。</p>

<p>關於米市場謠傳種種、僅係投機米蟲之技倆、最近因越局很復趨緊張、戰事有一觸即發之勢、　投機者乘機活躍、手播傳是非、竟謂香港當局為未雨綢繆計、已頒佈所謂「禁止米糧出口」命令、新聲社記者於獲得是項消息後、即分頭向關係方面探詢、據確實報告、港當局早有此項措置、不自今日始、且僅限於一部份、凡轉口或他埠米商所訂購米糧則不在此限、仍可源源出口、及發給出口證書、故洋米來源決無上斷之虞、投機米商之傳說、並非事實、</p>
<p>藥業集購</p>
<p>上海市新藥業同業公會昨日通告各藥房請限期定米、以接上海市商會轉米糧評價委員會函請、各業一致集團購米、各藥房如欲定者、請於函到三日以內、來函詳示包數（每包預付定洋四十元現鈔或即期劃頭支票）、以便　定、</p>
<p>評價工作</p>
<p>米糧評價會現雖在請求當局指未中、惟會內工作、仍不停頓、張念萱瞿振華兩委員、前因提請辭職、經多方挽留不獲、現暫請符前耕主持、</p>
<p>暗盤原因</p>
<p>今後本市民食之前途、雖有隱憂、惟無有匱乏之虞、西貢暹邏等處洋米、仍能絡續來滬、欲使米價平衡、疏通來源、當係第一要著、雖辦理手續不易、惟事在人為、瘊不能因其艱難而放棄、其次為市場組織之不健全、當無所諱言、一般所謂操縱投機者、大都為行與行之交易、在戰前之市場交易、秩序頗佳、即客售與行、行售與號、並無越軌舉動、今則客售與行、行仍輾轉舉動、今則客售與行、行仍輾轉與行交易、反置號家於不顧、如是私相授受、暗盤即隨之不顧、如是私相授受、暗盤即隨之產生、本埠較大之米行約二十餘家、盡可操縱全市之民食矣、當局如能嚴厲制止行與行之交易、一方再努力疏通來源、則本市民食問題、不致發生現在之嚴重性也、</p>

<h3 id="c67">三年來中國糧食豐收的實況 <a href="#c67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>— 陳華璋</p>
<p>語云：「民以食為天」，「饑饑之年，天下必亂，鹽收之歲。天下太平」：這足似說明平時對於糧食的重要。至於　時。它的重要性更十百倍於平時，所以古人論戰，以足食與足兵並重，而俗諺池驗著：「兵馬未動，糧草先行。從上面幾句中團歷代相傅約遺言看來，不艱知道糧食問題的重要·中國神聖抗戰揭幕以後紹米荒，每石價達百元以上；明相距小過三百華里約台州一帶，每石米價僅十　元，可說是少數地誡的情杉，是地方性的問題。凡上助舉，足證中國親食的供給，決非小足：可是缺少管理，我們　不否詔。</p>
<p>且看自由中國，自抗戰三年以來，年年豐收；而豐收的崔度，年有進步。所以三年來觀收的事實，要把國人已往、於釋食問題的觀點修正一下，換句說話，中國的糧食是不成問題的：而且還有多餘哩。茲就川縝黔三省的米產而論，據張心一先生的計算：川省產米一七，四九一千市擔，消費量為一一八，九四六千市擔，多餘五三，界四五千市擔。縝省產米方面山於宮有者口味食慾的結果，內為洋米麥的品質有絞國米麥梢好者，適於奢侈生活老的口味，所以沒海各樟如上海，霄波，廣州天津等地皆為洋米輸人的重要口牟，而內地就沒有吃洋米的習慣。目前，上海國米價格每石六七十元，完全在特殊環境下所造成。他如浙江寧國雖然應年有洋米麥進口；但不能謂為中劉糧食的不足，此其原因：一方面由於交通不便，沿海各省講買洋米比購內地國米為方便：另一食問題的嚴重性，其實，大可不多；因為中國以農立國，並　　無的資源，決不可與一個工業國家或一個資源貧乏的國家相提並論·中七，五二三千市據，消費量為三六，八四〇千市擔，冬餘六八三千市擔。黔省產米，一六，二五一千市擄，消費單為一八，一四三千市擔，多餘八，二〇八千市擔，因年年豐收的結果，實際收禪量當高於此項平均數字；吏因政府當局提倡增產和改良種仔等，產量一定增加很多。</p>
<p>三年來豐收的成績怎樣？據中央農業實驗所調查西北的寧夏，青海，甘肅和陝西；華中的河南，湖北。湖南和江西，沿海的浙江，爾建和威東；西南的四川，雲南，貴州共十四省五六九縣中，二十八年的生產情形的統計如下</p>
<p>尤是稱道的，二十八年上述十四省的總收穫，比二十年至二十六年七年的比均數字增加很多。增加的數量：計粳米增加五七，九四七，〇〇〇擔；高粱增加四，七二三，〇〇〇擔；　增加一，二四四，〇〇〇擔；　（膠貨）增加七，五，〇〇〇；玉蜀　增加三，九六五，〇〇〇擔；大豆增加二，五四六，〇〇〇擔；甘薯增加五六，八三二，〇〇〇擔；棉花增加一，〇三三，〇〇〇擔；花生增加二，三四，〇〇〇擔；胡蔴子增加六四〇，〇〇、擔；煙草增加七，二七四，〇〇〇擔；小麥增加二七，八九〇，〇〇〇擔；大麥增加七，二六一，〇〇〇擔。在二十八年的總收穫中，僅糯米一項減少，計比二十年至二十六年平均數量短少九五二，〇〇〇擔。（注：以上之１擔２等於一一〇，二三一磅）　　今年呢？六月開的大早，老實說，使很多的人擔群落，更使自山中願的人民憂慮得不可言狀。司分老天有眼，自六月三十日起，就開始普遍的隆雨，這次甘霖，北起甘陝，南訖瞋桂，都許遍的霧若；餓月雨量充足，使人們調旱災的憂慮完是消失在七月江十六日重歷的電訊裹，見到暘）省囉內以迭州娥霖，本年收穫，當可在必成以（所欐十成豐收純屬理論）四川以外俗省，芬無歉收才慮，如瞋黔兩省劊向奪歉牧，今年亦訂豐收。湘，鄒。纖，桂，粵萬貿年成尤佳，至叫北每省欣威亦頗好接演娣付到必貧八月七口電，大意是：陝中各縣以雨量適穴，夏壽收成任陝，秋禾叉慶鱉收。叉轎束某地八婦八日酗以。績東各地為產米之區，自人為以來，風調雨順，早稱已告豐收，情稱業已播種，一般農民，無不額手稱慶。２再長沙八月九日電：１今歲雨水調和，湘省又慶豐收，洞庭湖　各縣如華容湘陰殺已登　，當地駐軍紛紛協助農民割穀，實為勝利之象。２這許多足以說明中國今年糧食的大豐收。</p>
<p>據中央農業實驗所的報告，今年四川，雲南，貴州，江西，廣西，湖北，寧夏，青海，甘肅，陝西，江西，廣東，福建，浙江十四省的夏季收穫可達最好年成收穫的七成：穀　九一，八五〇，〇〇〇擔；　二三，五六五，〇〇〇擔；大另一半三六，〇〇五，〇〇〇擔；花生，一九，八一四，〇〇〇擔；煙草九，四三四，〇〇〇擔；糯米五一，七九一，〇〇〇擔；高粱二三，七九〇，〇〇〇擔；五穀類六六，七七五，〇〇〇擔；棉花五，七二五，〇〇〇擔；胡蔴七，七三六，〇〇〇擔；甘薯二三一，九七六，〇〇〇擔。至於冬收的數量，據佔計如下：小麥二〇二，一八四，〇〇〇擔；豌豆四二，一〇四，〇〇〇擔；大麥八二，〇三七，〇〇〇擔；油菜子四五，一〇六，〇〇〇擔；蠶豆四六，九九，〇〇〇擔；按今年收穫量的數字尚是估計數字，實際收穫當比　數字大。（注：以上之１擔２等於三三，三磅）</p>
<p>面對著這樣豐收的成績，一方面固要感恩著老天的賦予風調雨順；另方面還要歸功於政府當局的各種設施，茲探其要者，略述如下：</p>
<p>（一）農業金融的調整　抗戰以來，政府當局對於農村金融的調整可謂不遺餘國。在二十七年漢口金融會議中，就規定金融政策：（二）地方金融機關，設立農產倉庫：（三）增加農產押款；（四）增加農田機器貸款；（五）增放農產水利計劃借款；　農民得憑存倉農產抵押借款。各地方當局，都能積極實行著這幾項政策。各地銀行也都競爭作農村放款，以中國農民銀行為例，　陳清華氏１戰時中國農民銀行之農村放款一一文，各種農村放款的數字：（一）合作放款總額計達五千餘萬元；（二）合作金庫放款計三千八百餘萬元；（三）農倉放款計二百六十餘萬，後又撥專款一千二百萬元辦理農產抵押放款；（四）區救濟放款計八進餘萬元；（五）戰區救濟放款計千餘萬元：（六）放款講一千萬元；（七）計達八百四十餘萬元　計約為一萬二千萬元。中國另一農業金融本局在抗戰後，對於農村金融的　也很大，（八）本年中專對貧農放款二二，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元之钜，據會計，全國各金融機關的農村放款總額　少當在一萬五千萬元以上，偌大的資金流入農村，問題流動，當然足以促進農業的大量生產。</p>
<p>（二）農田水利的進行，水利的失利是根絕天災的大計。此項水利工程大都偏重西北各省，例如陝西梅惠　灌田二十萬畝，洛惠梁灌田可五十萬畝……。近年來，西南各省的水利工程亦繼續進行。四川都江堰已於去年春聞完成，　川西十四縣，計受益農田二百六十多萬畝；三臺鄭澤堰亦於去年完成，川北的農田受益非淺。此外，西南，西北諸省正在與　中的還很多。</p>
<p>（三）農業倉庫的建立　農業倉庫的作用是解除農民的剝削，防止投機份子的操縱。戰事發生後，經濟部除督促各省依農倉　和非常時期簡易農倉暫行辦法推進農倉事業外，更由農本局統籌辦理。據何廉氏談，截至去年十月底止，農　倉庫已設九十二所，容量達二，二四七，四一五市石，此外尚有二十七所在籌健中。截至去年九月底止，各倉儲押放款纍計額為一，〇〇〇，四六一，五八元，結餘額三五八，四四六，九四元。各倉兼營保管總　近三百萬元，購銷總值六十餘萬元。</p>
<p>（四）移民　殖舉辦　抗戰以來，戰區民眾避至後方的日眾。政府當局一面頒佈非常時期難民墾荒條例，一面派員分赴西南西北各省調查可墾荒地，費時七月，統計調查所得，計有可荒地數百萬畝，可容墾民五十萬人。在西北方面的墾務，已有可觀的成績。</p>
<p>（五）農業教育的實施經濟部為求農產的增加，決定對農業人材，加意培植，曾在重慶開辦農業推廣人員訓練班，由中國辦理農村最有聲望的金陵大學負責從事訓練。</p>
<p>此外，尚有關於農產運銷，牲畜保險，合作事業等等，均能促進農業的生產。</p>
<p>據七月三十日重慶電，行政院為統籌全國糧食的產銷儲運，調節其供求關係，設置全國糧食管理局。該局已於八月一日起開始辦公，內設行政管制，業務管制，財務三處，及秘書研究兩室。行政管制處司糧食的調查統計等事項；業務管制處司糧食的產銷等事項。現在該局的初步工作：在求明　全國糧食情形，特別為糧食商人與糧食市　的現況。然　再積極進行糧食調劑工作，一方面注意軍食民食有計劃的調劑；一方面注重地段上合理的分配。上面已經說過中國糧食的供給，決非不足；但成為問題的是缺少管理。如今全國糧食管理局已成立，並已開始工作，所以今後的管理已不成問題，無疑的，一定能收到管理上的宏效。在糧食豐收和管理得宜的兩重條件下，中國的糧食問題已完全解決，這是使我們萬分欣幸的！　括說來，中國三年來的糧食大豐收，已使抗戰勝利的基礎俞益堅強！</p>

<p>— 編者</p>
<p>至於封鎖馬克與自　馬克之辨別方法，則不甚詳其底細。惟余意以為，閣下如欲收受馬克，不妨以是否德國蘭英銀行Reieha　banc發行，且其票面是否在十馬克以上者為斷。凡屬蘭英銀行發行之十馬克以上的馬克，乃係德國國內唯一之法貨，與金馬克（事實上並無金馬克流通）同。當非封鎖馬克，可以進出自由（其實出口時仍須接受匯兌編製法之限制）。此外之德國通貨或匯票，收受時則應著重。若不分辨其用途範圍，則不啻自投羅綱，其受封鎖也。總之，今之所謂封鎖馬克；已非上次歐戰時發行之某種特殊通貨，以示其與自由馬克異。又不如我國之惟匯劃票為封鎖通貨，故形式上不與法有極大之差異。此外　屬自由通貨</p>

<h3 id="c70">關於公債問題七則 <a href="#c70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>— 編者</p>
<p>劉琪君　承詢各點，茲蘭答如次：</p>
<p>（一）公債高價難在票面之下，但還本付息，均按票面十足計算。故發行公全身唐古喇山早，應十足募集；但當通常有幾分折扣，一為鼓勵人民購買，一為抵　銀行等代辦手續費。故不論認購或派募均應依發行條例辦理。銀行向政府購債，而係政府以公債向銀行抵借，則其抵借額，當隨市債轉移。因認購公債，係長期投資；而銀行接受公債抵押，乃係短期放款。既屬短期放款，自應考慮其可能收回之資金共有幾何？叵按高價計算，則到期政府即使不來贖取，銀行可出售於市場而不致損失。此種情形，中外皆然。並非發行時對各種債權人有所歧視。</p>
<p>（二）公債市價，純由市場主觀心理而定：並無計價標準。因其合理之標準，　票面外別無其他。然市場中人常視還本付息期之遠近，各債市價經常維繫之比額等等而推算；此僅能合出其投資或投機之利息為多少，並不能因此而決定市價。</p>
<p>（三）八一三戰前，政府因當時各債價發　漲，唯恐受人搗亂，曾有最低限價之設置。在限價之上，仍可自由上落。當時撰寫上之最低限價統甲為七十六元，統乙為七十三元五角，就丙為七十元五角，丁　兩種為七十元，尊函所謂有六折，恐係弄錯。此項法令，今日依然有效，目前祇因上海環境特殊，未能推行。</p>
<p>（四）一國突然發生對外戰爭，人心不兔恐慌。影響所及，市場不兔混亂。為避免此種不必要之波動，並使經濟界得從平和體制從容轉入戰時體制計，各國政府，輒於開戰之初，明令各種集中性之市場，如交易所之類），停止營業。故當八一三戰事發生前片刻，政府即令各種交易所停業。證交更不能例外；因債信有關國庫信用，故各國對其他交易，果有准其在戰時即行復業者；對於證交，非至戰事結果，無有准其復業者。如有黑市場，無不來歷取締。我國因有上海之存在，非特不能消滅黑市場，且各不得不變相承認其黑交易之公開化。黑交易之由綢業銀行樓上公然擁入證交大廈樓上，恐先得財政當局之默契　？以吾人猜測，在下述三點，財政當心亦有其默認之必要。一因國家財力既然雄厚，不怕不能維持　信，試觀債市　價，自黑交易公開化後，即節節上漲；二為深信證交中人，明大義者多；雖亦不乏喪心病狂之徒，僅為一已投機利益，甘做空頭，散放不利債市之消息，企圖壓低債價。然其勢力不大，遠不能與多頭匹敵。徒供犧牲。第三；政府默認黑交易公開化之最大理由，恐在購置交與金融市場之關係太深，因金融界增以購置公債，作為處理其存款之主要手段。因購置公債，有如將顧客之存款利息，轉嫁於國庫，且可獲得更多之溢出息金。設證交市場不恢復，金融界即失其周轉資金之門戶。政府默認黑交易之公開化，蓋在情理之中。</p>
<p>（五）債市　降，不論平時或戰時，除純由投機者作　外，則無不與市場資金（即銀要）鬆緊有關。其受匯市金市之影響，亦不外乎是。每當匯市金市投機激烈時，資金每由債市流。匯市金市，反之，則又流回。在此或出或進中，債市之供需平衡即為之失調；債市乃為之波動。此外之聯擊性，不過投機者之穿　附會。</p>
<p>（六）依戰前證交方面規定：統一各債市本證票面每萬元為六百元，持下每萬元為八百元至九六公債之本證，每萬為四百元，特證每萬為四百元，佣金則至少須照交易額收千分之一。委託銀行代購，依理限於現貨。故毋須保證金，至多只收若幹手續費，其實率且必較經紀人佣金為小。</p>
<p>（七）購置公債，較其他投資優越而且可靠。今日每謂外匯套　常達七八分者，實則公債合息，經常總在七八分乃至一角五分之多，所不同者，此係長期投資。若當投機做，利益亦不小。各錢荘每常市場供過於求時收　公債，其價必低，然公債之價必漲，因不僅有國庫為後臺，隨時可以要求抵押貼現。目有各銀行錢做後臺，因彼等莫不　有钜額公債，為維持彼等準備金之價值計，亦非力維公債價格不可。閣下若為錢荘擔愁出路，錢荘中人即將笑閣下之過於忠厚。</p>

<p>— 聖</p>
<p>——九月十四日</p>
<p>日本匯價與貿易</p>
<p>日本向來匯價，是維持對英一先令二便士的基準，一九三九年八月旬歐洲的局勢出緊迫而訴諸戰爭，英　發生動搖，它對美匯價由四元六角八分跌落至三元八角二分，而日本國與英鎊聯緊，對美匯價亦大跌，因此暫時採用英蘭銀行那時法定匯價四，〇二算出對美匯價二十三元又十六份之七，於十月二十五日正式脫離英鎊而與美元聯緊。當時更變的最大理由，是物價高漲，已形成嚴重問題，要阻止通貨膨脹，就不得不穩定匯價，同時為自美國大量輸入軍需物資，更不得不穩定美匯在一固定水準，以免進口物價的高翔。</p>
<p>但是英隨戰事的演進，繼續低落，對於日本頗有種種不利。日本的國際貿易，對英鎊集團是出超，對美元集團是入超，然而近年來對英鎊集團的輸出漸減，對美元集團的圖稿漸增，在歐戰長期化後，這一趨勢更顯。本月十三日日外相松　在日本貿易協會認１歐戰已使日本的出口貿易大減，及對美關係的惡化，獲取主要貨品的問題愈增困難２。蓋日本向美購進貨物非付現款不可，倘在英鎊集團內所得英鎊不能自由兌換美元，則日本購買軍需材料所需資金，不易籌劃。同時日元因與美元聯擊，對英鎊集團的輸出，大受匯價高的限制，因向來英鎊集團內貿易可以一先令二便士值一日元的行市去購日貨，現在要以一先令六便士弱（今年五，六月行市）　的行市去購買，日貨在鎊集團的價值抬高，自然要影響到銷路而致出口不振。</p>
<p>自從七月十八日英國加強統制外匯之後，自由英鎊在八月半左右已與法定鎊相等，因之日元匯價亦在八月十四日回復到從前的水準一先令二便士，而倫敦對日匯價亦在同日重復抑低到一先令二便士的買價。在理論上講，日元匯價這一次的動向，應該對日本的出口貿易羅為有利了，但是證之外相松　的言論，中端凶在英國嚴格統制外匯之情況下，日本出口貿易還是悲觀的。（完）</p>

<p>— 蕭亢石</p>
<p>也是幾件清涼的勸世良劑</p>
<p>歲歲有中秋，獨有這四年來的中秋，感到說不出的情景；那孤島外的任何地方，在今晚上嫦娥看到一種特殊悽慘的景況，也當有動於中！同時又看到繁華的島民，依然做他們的迷夢，眞使伊—娥嫦—引起多少感慨呢！</p>
<p>在中秋節的晚上，那在陶醉生活中的孤島民眾，當然又是大事鋪張，吃節酒，供月亮，玩這套糜費的習俗，而絕不顧念到替國家節省一些財力。現在單講中秋應時的食品，像月餅，藕，梨，柿，菱，的一類東西，却含有箴規現日一般人通病的意義！也是幾件清涼的勸世良劑！所以不得不把它寫在下面，以告讀者：</p>
<p>月餅：月餅把宅割開分食，是寓意假使一國家的滅亡，也是和月餅一樣的給強者分割！可是月餅裏面的饀子，種類不一，又分着許多種黃黑藍白的顏色，在這裏，倒可表示着現代人們的良心，也和月餅一樣，外面的壳子，雖然同一顏色，而其內容却要分出它的好劣黑白，所以在每一個人吃月餅的時候，也當自己檢點一下，良心和月餅的饀子顏色，屬於那一種——白和黑？</p>
<p>藕：在藥性上載，藕味甘，性平，無毒，解熱毒，和蜜食之，不生諸蟲，在這人心熾熱而毒辣的時代，倒可大家飽啖其藕，以除熾熱而毒辣的念頭。</p>
<p>梨：梨味甘，性寒，無毒，人心肝二經，主心經客熱，所以沒有定力的人，大可一食生梨，以驅心經客熱，免得利慾薰心之後，陷於昏迷之途，終至不可藥救。</p>
<p>柿：柿味甘　，性寒，無毒，通耳鼻，所以一般失了聽聞的人們，大可一食柿子，使得恢復它的理智，聽聽四野災黎的呼籲，聞聞人氣的香臭，以作親近疎遠的標準。</p>
<p>菱：菱的顏色，壳紅肉白，這是表示着現代做人，要知菱的組織一樣，內心，必須潔白，一塵不染才是。</p>
<h3 id="c83">紅豆花編結法 <a href="#c83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>

<h3 id="c84">閒談月餅 <a href="#c84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>— 屠守拙</p>
<p>月餅之制，由來已久，「中秋夜，人家各置有月宮符像，符上兎如人立，陳瓜果於庭，餅面繪月宮蟾兎，男女肅拜燒香，日而焚之」可知爾時已有月餅，特形式或與今大同小異耳。</p>
<p>兒時茶食肆，售葷合錦月餅，每盒大者四枚，小者八枚，價祇制錢一百六十文而已。厥後步漲至三百二十支，買者已深嫌其貴，今則每盒需四五角，餅饀且遠不如當時之豐富也。</p>
<p>自廣式月餅盛行。幾奪蘇式月餅之席，然其價則愈昂。昨見大公司櫥窗內，陳列徑尺廣式大月餅一巨枚，標價法幣三百元，殊令窮措大咋舌不置。</p>
<p>廣式月餅，有小月餅一種，愚最嗜食之，戰前每枚售二分，恒市一二盒備療飢，今年其價增至每枚八分，恰符工人物價指數法幣購買力每元為二五·之比例。將來事變弭平後，欲稽考非常時期物價者，大可就小月餅一項，類推其他。</p>
<p>蘇式月餅，黏膩不易銷化，固其短處，然清水玫瑰饀之芬留齒頰，清水薄荷饀之涼沁沁脾，亦廣式月餅所不能及。愚本饕餮徒，魚與熊掌，皆所欲也；惜　阮羞澀，祇能談餅消饑矣。</p>
<p>玫瑰薄荷售價昂貴後，嘗目覩製月餅饀者，多以白糖乾麪和紅綠顏色水為代，姑不論喪失「香」「涼」之美風味，卽就衛生言，啖顏料入腸胃，亦屬無益有害，欲購月餅者，願母再購此名存實亡之玫瑰薄荷兩饀也。</p>
<h3 id="c85">臨睡前的幾件事 <a href="#c85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>— 田青</p>
<p>一到晚上，便感覺到一雙眼臉重得什麼似的，要閉合攏來，四肢也軟乏無力，一坐定，呵欠連一接二的打個不停，這是忙碌了整整一天後的反應，惟有睡眠來補足身體的疲倦。不過在臨睡前的幾件事，很有注意一下的必要，因為對於身體健康方面有密切的關係。</p>
<p>在晚上臨睡時刷牙這件事最易忽略，然而却很緊要的，因為吃了一天的東西，在牙齒隙縫間不免遺留着一些屑粒，如就寢以前再不刷牙，則在睡眠中，口腔閉塞，空氣便不流通，於是微生物在殘物中繁殖起來，因此發生口臭及蛀牙的疾病，如果牙齒一不健全，那對於積身體的健康朋在阻碍，所以在食後刷牙，是一件必做的事，不過這樣似乎是太麻煩，那麼一日早晚二次，是最低的限度了。</p>
<p>刷了牙，再喝些白開水，也是需要的，因為食物經口一番的咀嚼而入食道，再進胃而後至腸，同時營消化作用，在胃壁和腸壁上都不免有食物遺屑，所有臨睡羊一杯開水，一方面是幫助消化，而另有洗凈胃腸壁的功能，使那遺屑不致逗留在一處，否則對於胃腸有不利的影響。</p>

<p>今天是農歷曆中秋節，有錢的人家，少不得要開筵賞月，五十元一百元的酒席，儘管大喝大嚼，滿不在乎；但我們經紀人家，雖逢佳節，也依舊要在經濟上打算一下，所以我照例仍配兩葷兩素的菜。兩色葷菜，一是青菜燜肉圓，便是象徵今夜的明月，取其團圓之意。近來青菜已有大棵應市，雖未經霜，菜心已略帶甜味，和肉圓一同紅燜，更覺腴美可口。魚圓自製，雖略覺麻煩，但看佳節分上，也不妨麻煩一下。買白魚一尾，將魚肉刮下，用刀背刴細，加細鹽與冷開水拌和，做成圓子，下在溫開水中，然後與綫粉一同燒熟。倘在刴魚肉的時候，再將荸薺切小丁子加入，吃時更耐咀嚼。湯用白湯，略加鹽光和味精，以取鮮味。</p>

<p>— 郁方</p>
<p>「賞月」以外的問題</p>
<p>生活在忽促中，一轉眼又是中秋節了！</p>
<p>「月到中秋分外明」，這含有詩意的畫景，許會引起我們不少甜蜜的回憶以，——大家吃團聚飯，分大月餅，說月餅的故事……雖然這麼快樂的鏡頭，在今天的孤島上，不是沒有，當大家瞧瞧擺在那些公司櫃窗中的標價幾十元甚至幾百元的特製月餅，想像中的這些月餅的顧客們的幸福的程度，著實遠超過我們往昔的甜夢，但大多數的孤市的人們，也還不是一樣；連每日三餐的飯米，也還是在擔心中，何暇於「賞月」「吃餅」之類的「雅興」呢？</p>
<p>「……幾家歡樂幾家愁？」不知道這是誰寫下的「中秋」的詩句，正像描盡了我們這一個時代的生活著的人們，</p>
<p>「中秋」在我們工商界中，照例又是結賬的一個慣節，人欠欠我，大都在這個節頭上，有一番例行的結算，幾年來，生意好，賬頭好，工商各業莫不在欣喜中度去這節頭。尤其是今年新春開盤以來的市況，物價飛騰上漲，這氣象是挺「景氣」的。</p>
<p>許是「物極必反」的原因吧，五月中旬以來，孤市物價驟現了滯呆的形象，繼之如五金，紗花，棉布之類，開始由高度綫上，逐漸向下傾跌，由於一般人民消費力量的減弱，整個市面才像露出了膨脹積食，消化不名的病症，「壞了！」我們聽得有人在呼喊了。</p>
<p>同時，好些實業工廠，在減工，停工的狀態中，這是整個孤市工商界動向的最好的縮影！一般公司商店，臨了這夏去秋來的季節，本來正是她們欣欣向榮的生意時節，但今天清淡與蕭條的景況，著實　削了好些工商者們對景氣的希望，反之，有好些是在對著囤積著的存貨擔心焦愁！</p>
<p>開源一，「節流」，這又將是我們工商界中必然的趨勢。隨著孤市「景氣」的變更為蕭條，減工，停工，甚至停薪，裁員，必然地漸將擴大於未來！而作為結賬日期的今次中秋節，在往昔也往往是工商界中人事調動的季節，我們可不堪想像有幾多的工商從業同仁，會失去了他們生活的根據——職業呢！</p>
<p>這是一個悲慘的發展迷懷抱中，以互助團結的立塲，我們希望各業同仁及工商當局，和社會熱心人士，來多多地注意這個問題的嚴重，及時設法予以解決和救濟，那是非常迫要的！</p>

<p>補破鈔票</p>
<p>編輯先生：</p>
<p>恕借貴報一角讓我發表些意見。</p>
<p>我是一個小學畢業之烟店學徒，所以在我手中每天有幾十元鈔要進出，最近發現很多破鈔票，這些破票自然免不了要補了。</p>
<p>補鈔有一種有規則之清潔紙才行，而相反我每天所見之補鈔票紙皆係破爛不堪，如舊報紙。舊書紙之小片等，……甚至有電車票補者。</p>
<p>為這緣故，我們店內備了些清潔之白紙條，約三分之一寸闊，以備破票來時卽行留心去補。我覺得這樣很好，我希望每一店備些紙條漿糊以備補破鈔票之用，我更希望一般以破紙補鈔票者，勿再如此。</p>

<p>第七章　「把他押起來」</p>
<p>陸健笙搖頭道：「不，不會這樣簡單。當伊在汽車中向我解釋以後，我馬上表示讓我來對付他，祇要伊這個人的名字地址和職業告訴我，我自有法子，伊也用不著恐懼。可是麗蘭到底不肯告訴我，反而勸阻我不要和這個人為難。伊曾向我說：「你犯不著跟他鬥,太沒有意思。我也並不怕他，讓他去好啦。」這幾句話明明是騙我的，伊實在很怕這個人。因為我們到了電影院中，伊還是現著不安的樣子，不時向前後瞭望。</p>
<p>霍桑道：「你在電影院中可曾再瞧見他？」</p>
<p>陸健笙道：「沒有，我也曾瞧過一瞧，却瞧不見他。不過我相信麗蘭一定是這姓趙的打死的。……倪探長，你可曾已查出這個人？」</p>
<p>倪金　答道：「我們但知道這個人叫趙伯雄——那也許是化名的，本來住在亞東旅館七七四號，現在却已搬走。他做什麼職業，我們還沒有知道。霍先生的袋裏還有他的一張照片。除此以外，我們還不知道什麼。」</p>
<p>陸健笙的眼光移到霍桑的方向時，霍桑早已從胸口袋裏摸出那張小照片來。陸健笙趕緊立起來接受那照片。</p>
<p>他連連點頭說：「正是他，你們總也瞧見，這副嘴臉也說不上漂亮啊。」</p>
<p>他把照片翻過來瞧瞧，又驚訝地說：「唉，這五個亞東七七四」鉛筆字，是麗蘭的筆跡啊。</p>
<p>霍桑仍舊將照片收回了，點點頭說：「是的，請坐下。我還有話問你。你昨夜用汽車去接王麗蘭的嗎？」</p>
<p>陸健笙重新坐下了，答道：「是的，那時大約在六點半光景。我們先到仙宮舞廳裏去兜了一個圈子，然後就到白梅酒家去吃夜飯。」　（一〇八）</p>

Since the period from September 8th to 14th, the Japanese on the northern and southern battlefields have been making moves. Our army has met them head-on with fierce resistance, repeatedly inflicting heavy damage. The more important of these battles are described below:</p>
<p>Guangxi and Guangdong: After the Hua army in southern Guangxi defeated the Japanese invading Shangsi last week, they immediately took advantage of the victory to recapture Shangsi County on the morning of the 4th. On the 7th, they also captured strongholds such as Baifu, Pingfu, and Fozi southwest of Shangsi. The Japanese army retreated westward, and over the past week, we have pursued and annihilated the defeated Japanese, killing over a thousand. At the same time, another part of our army had many warehouses, and the Japanese were extremely panic-stricken.</p>
<p>Shanxi and Hebei: The Hua army in Shanxi and Hebei continues to disrupt Japanese railway traffic on the Pinghan, Zhengtai, and Tongpu lines, achieving great success. The section of the Pinghan Railway from Beiping to Shijiazhuang is still not open to traffic. The Yangfangkou station on the Tongpu Railway was captured by our army, and trains on this line can only travel north to Taigu and south to Houma. The Japanese suffered even greater losses on the Zhengtai Railway, and it is estimated that it will take at least three months to repair it completely. As of the 8th, over 3,000 Japanese soldiers have been killed in these battles.</p>
<p>Hubei and Jiangxi: The Japanese troops on the west bank of the Han River in central Hubei, in areas such as Jingmen, Dangyang, Yidu, and Shashi, and on the east bank in areas such as Zhongxiang and Hanchuan, have repeatedly invaded our positions in the past week, but they have all been repelled. In particular, in the battles of Xiejiadian in Jingmen-Dangyang and Moji Mountain across from Yichang, a large number of Japanese soldiers were annihilated. Furthermore, the Hua army in eastern Hubei attacked the Huayuan station on the Pinghan Railway three times, inflicting heavy damage on the Japanese. The Hua army in southern Jiangxi besieged Tingsiqiao, inflicting significant blows on the Japanese. In the past week, the Hua army in northern Jiangxi has launched a large-scale disruption of Japanese transportation, thoroughly destroying the roadbeds and bridges along the Nanxun and Ruiwu Railways. Our elite troops also took the opportunity to attack Wuning.</p>

<p>Chongqing: The spokesman of the Military Affairs Commission said that we defeated over 2,000 Japanese troops invading Xidian from Mingjiang. A unit of Japanese troops from Zhennanguan on the Guangxi-Vietnam border once again invaded Dongdeng across the border on the 7th, but they were all repelled by the French army. The Japanese rear route was cut off by our army and has fallen into a dilemma of advancing and retreating. In southern Guangdong, the Hua army has continued to launch fierce attacks on Japanese strongholds on the outskirts of Guangzhou, such as Xinjie, Longkou, Fengyong, Guanyao, Taihe, and Guantang, killing a large number of Japanese troops. These strongholds are now completely under our control. A part of our army has also entered Guangzhou, destroying Japanese barracks and capturing over 300 prisoners. The Hua army in eastern Shanxi has successively captured strongholds such as Huixing, Shangxiashe Town, Xingdao Town, and Ximosi in the southeast of Shouyang in recent days and is continuing to besiege Meng County, Shouyang, and other places, and is fiercely annihilating the Japanese army in the area west of Jingxing and north of Niangziguan. The Hua army in southern Shanxi broke into the eastern gate of Jiang County and engaged in street fighting with the Japanese, and is also mopping up the Japanese army in the area north of Zhongtiao Mountain on the west side of the Tongpu Railway, achieving glorious results. The Japanese troops in Qinyang, northern Henan, who invaded Fanzhuang and Guzhang Village in the west, were also severely damaged and retreated in defeat.</p>
<p>East of Zhuxi and Japanese strongholds near Nanchang such as Kunxi, engaged in fierce battles for several days, killing a great number of Japanese. Another elite force attacked Mahuiling, severely annihilating the Japanese army. The Japanese in all these locations are now tightly surrounded by our forces and are continuing to be fiercely attacked.</p>
<p>Shandong and Jiangsu: Along the Jiaoji Railway in Shandong Province, the Hua army repeatedly engaged in fierce battles with the Japanese at Banxianling southeast of Boshan, Zongguozhen east of Zhanhua, and within the territory of Zhangqiu, capturing countless weapons and ammunition. We are currently continuing to mop up. Over 1,000 Japanese troops from Tongshan and Sui counties in northern Jiangsu have repeatedly invaded Gaojiatang west of Sui County in recent days, but they were defeated by our forces. The Japanese left behind hundreds of bodies, as well as machine guns and other equipment. Furthermore, the Japanese troops invading Yunnancun Wangzhuang northwest of Tongshan were engaged in a fierce hand-to-hand battle in the sorghum fields for ten hours in torrential rain, capturing the Hua Ancestral Temple. The Japanese suffered heavy damage and were unable to move.</p>
<p>Other: There are other battle achievements on other fronts that are particularly noteworthy. (1) The Hua army in eastern Suiyuan captured Xinghe County and cut off Japanese traffic on the Sui-Zhang Highway. (2) In Anhui Province, we attacked Wangjiang and Anqing and defeated the invading Japanese in Guichi and other places, killing nearly 1,000 Japanese soldiers.

<h3 id="e10">Increasingly Active US Far East Policy <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>With the increasing tension in Vietnam, the US Far East policy is also becoming more active. In addition to Secretary of State Hull's statement of concern about the current situation in Vietnam, the US government is also considering banning the export of scrap iron, and is proceeding with the fortification of Guam and Midway Island and the strengthening of defensive works in Hawaii. According to US naval sources, Guam will become the Gibraltar of the Pacific, and Secretary of the Navy Knox has stated that he is determined to make Pearl Harbor the strongest fortress in the Pacific. At the same time, President Roosevelt expanded the scope of the embargo on the 13th, banning the sale of aircraft and engine designs and gasoline manufacturing equipment to foreigners. Since the announcement of the termination of the US-Japan Commercial Treaty on July 26 of last year, the various actions of the US in the Far East have been in direct proportion to the deterioration of the overall situation in the Far East. Even though the center of turmoil in the South Pacific has recently shifted from the world-renowned Dutch East Indies to Vietnam, under the cover of the war against China and relations with the Axis powers, the US has not been deceived, but has instead increasingly promoted its active concern.</p>
<p>From the end of the previous European war to the present, the US has consistently maintained its firm tone in the Far East, with the fundamental goal of safeguarding the balance of power in the Pacific and ensuring the integrity of China's territorial sovereignty. The reactions triggered by various international incidents over the past nine years are sufficient to make people deeply aware of the US's position and determination. However, in those years, unfortunately, there was a lack of international and national coordination, and isolationist views acted as a restraint. Furthermore, there was excessive reliance on arms reduction treaties and non-aggression pacts, which resulted in an invisible lag in the international arms race. As a result, the practical performance of the US did not fully match its determination to maintain a just order, which is why the aggressor nations, knowing the US's traditional national policy, dared to act recklessly. Because of this, they even went so far as to misunderstand the US's position, thinking that they could sway it with sweet talk and small favors. They believed that even if this approach did not necessarily ease relations between the two countries, they could simply respond to those written protests and verbal condemnations with accomplished facts. However, in fact, people who are good at tolerance are often the most capable of action. Once tolerance exceeds its limits, it will immediately transform into unparalleled power. This phenomenon is precisely a portrayal of US Far East policy in recent years. Since the hard-line ultimatum in December 1938 did not produce the desired effect, the US immediately changed from being cautious to being resolute. Various powerful and important measures, from embargoes to military expansion, have been successively implemented. The aspirations that were previously only expressed in empty words have now gradually been realized in practical actions, which is enough to uplift the feelings of the world and provide a solid warning against acts of aggression.</p>
<p>However, the use of any powerful and effective measure requires, first and foremost, seizing the most appropriate opportunity. For example, measures such as embargoes and the termination of treaties would not have been implemented until now, and the wildfires in the Far East would probably not have spread so widely. The isolationists who have hindered the implementation of US national policy in the past have made the entire world pay a considerable price. Recently, the power of these people has been reduced, and the narrow-minded opinions of those who seek only self-preservation are rarely seen in newspapers and documents. However, a small number of conservatives still stubbornly defend their positions. Reading President Roosevelt's remarks on the exchange of warships and bases between Britain and the US, he indicated that it was necessary to give these people time to fully digest the situation, which shows that the above-mentioned resistance still exists. On the other hand, some Americans cannot help but overstate the threat from Europe, seeing aid to Britain and the defense of the Atlantic as the most important tasks currently facing the US, and they underestimate the imminent crisis in the Far East. The existence of these two forces is, objectively speaking, almost equivalent to cancer in US Far East policy. At the same time, it also provides the aggressors with opportunities for maneuver. Recently, Secretary of State Hull has repeatedly reiterated the US's determination regarding the Dutch East Indies and Vietnam, but this has not been enough to prevent the continued deterioration of the situation in the South China Sea. A small part of the reason is the excessive internal constraints in the US, and the upcoming presidential election is also seen as a reason for not taking further action. The main reason is that the bitter struggle between Britain and Germany is attracting the attention of the US, and it is expected that before the outcome of the decisive battle between Britain and Germany is clear, the US will hardly take further strong measures in the Far East. The economic and political weapons that the US has used in the Far East in the past have inadvertently increased the inertia of the recipients, making them accustomed to it and unaware of its effects. If they were used in their totality at the appropriate time, the effect would be very different. Of course, those who are perceptive can understand that the US's intention is definitely not to merely stimulate or warn in this way. However, in terms of effectiveness, it is indeed necessary to reconsider the steps and methods of implementing its firm policy.</p>
<p>In this regard, one cannot help but deeply lament that the opportunities for joint action by Britain, the US, France, and the Soviet Union in the Far East in the past were never realized due to various constraints. Now, France is powerless, and Britain is also preoccupied with its own affairs. The remaining two major powers, the US and the Soviet Union, bear a much heavier responsibility for the Far East crisis than in the past. However, the coordination between the two is still lacking in good results. If it were not for China's efforts to firmly support the situation in extreme difficulty, it is not difficult to imagine what the Far East would be like today. In addition to the increasingly active US Far East policy, we would like to express further expectations to the wise US authorities: the war between Britain and Germany cannot be resolved in a day, and its outcome is like waiting for the Yellow River to run clear. The crisis in the South Pacific is imminent and cannot be allowed to develop naturally. Please do not overemphasize the European situation to the extent that you miss the effective opportunity to bring order out of chaos in the Far East. Second, the various measures to stabilize the Far East now exist in isolation. If they are allowed to remain in this state, it will give the aggressors an opportunity to defeat them one by one. The US should take an active responsibility in this regard, forming a Far East anti-aggression front, leaving no gaps for the aggressors to exploit. Third, the use of all economic, political, and even military weapons requires swift action, decisive action, and a comprehensive solution instead of dealing with individual problems in a piecemeal fashion. Fourth, backward conservative ideas and erroneous views should only be overcome, not excessively accommodated. If it is said that in the midst of a general election, one must cater to the ingrained prejudices of the people in order to win, then a figure like Roosevelt would not be so concerned with gains and losses as to disregard the future of the country. We firmly believe that if everything can be used properly, the solution to the Far East problem does not necessarily depend on a naval battle in the Pacific. However, if we continue to procrastinate and delay, allowing the aggressors to gain the upper hand, then there is a greatest possibility of precipitating the outbreak of war.</p>

<p>Honolulu: Secretary of the Navy Colonel Knox warned the US yesterday that "only force can give us security." These words were publicly declared in the Department of Commerce here, because the Secretary of the Navy was inspecting defenses in Hawaii at the time. He said that if we "do not seek security in the entire Western Hemisphere," then there is no security in the world. He said that the naval and air bases in the Western Hemisphere that the US recently obtained from Britain have "significant implications" for European progress. Regarding the status of Hawaii, the Secretary of the Navy said that "these islands are crucial to defending the entire Western Hemisphere." He also said that the consequences of the most degenerative combat power have caused numerous European countries to suffer defeat. The Secretary of the Navy said, "They have gradually weakened, but are we also becoming weaker like them?" Before returning to Washington, Colonel Knox will fly to San Diego to conduct a two-day inspection there. (Associated Press dispatch from the 15th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The US government has recently announced a strong new naval policy, the main purpose of which is to build a two-ocean navy and develop naval aviation. The General Affairs Department of the Department of the Navy recently issued a statement saying that this policy is based on the current situation. The purpose of this policy is to maintain a navy capable of operating in two oceans and to develop naval aviation to become a complete fighting force. In addition, this new policy also includes the following items: (1) the development and maintenance of coastal activities, including the construction of important bases to facilitate the mobilization of troops; (2) measures regarding the location of coastal activities, such as the establishment of geographical areas, and the construction of increased security to prevent attacks; (3) cultivating civilian industries useful in wartime; (4) making the development of naval shipbuilding superiority the main goal, so that the ratio exceeds that of other countries. The statement also reiterated the previous policy of always strategically deploying fleets and emphasized that each fleet must engage in two months of exercises each year. The statement also said that the Asian Fleet and other ships will continue to be prepared to join the main fleet. The policy of developing a major base each on the East Coast, West Coast, and Hawaii will continue, and the air bases on remote islands and coastal areas will also be newly improved.

<p>President Requests Establishment of Budget</p>
<p>400,000 People to Enlist Next Month</p>
<p>Washington: After weeks of debate in Congress, the military service bill has been passed in a compromise form and has now been sent to the White House for approval. The first batch of 75,000 conscripts will be convened on November 1 according to this bill. These 75,000 people will be selected from among the 16.65 million young men aged 21 to 35, all of whom must register in accordance with the law in order to be selected for military service. The bill also stipulates that the government has the right to take over factories that manufacture or defend military supplies, if necessary, in accordance with leasing methods. (Reuters dispatch from the 15th)</p>
<p>Washington: Yesterday, the Senate and House of Representatives adopted the historic "Burke-Wadsworth" Enlistment Act, which will allow the US Navy and Army to reach a total of 5 million soldiers. After the two chambers expressed satisfaction with the enlisted bill that had been modified, President Roosevelt immediately asked Congress to authorize the establishment of a budget, with cash funds of US$1,733,000,000 and agreed funds of US$270,000,000 dedicated to implementing the enlistment program. According to the Enlistment Act, there should be 16.65 million men registered, of whom 400,000 will be drafted into the army next month. After receiving this enlistment bill, Congress took 86 days to pass the bill. After the amendments, the bill stipulates that men between the ages of 21 and 35 must register. The Senate passed the bill with a vote of 47 to 25, while the House of Representatives passed it with a vote of 232 to 124. Before the official vote, the two chambers engaged in fierce debate, and at one point wanted to postpone the bill until after the general election in December. The Senate yesterday rejected a provision of the Enlistment Act, which stipulated that the President should be authorized to take over factories that are unwilling to accept fair contracts for national defense production. It is reported that after the Enlistment Act is passed, by October, the United States will have more than 1 million men who have completed training. By January 1 of next year, the United States will have the largest standing army since the World War. According to the Enlistment Act, the Navy Department can also recruit new soldiers into the army, but the naval soldiers who are drafted will serve with the army. The Enlistment Act also allows the government to recruit workers. Observers believe that thousands of men will be mobilized to receive advanced machine training to improve the country's wartime industry for the army and navy.

<p>Vichy: According to news from Vietnam, concerning the issue of Japan establishing spheres of influence in Vietnam, the French and Japanese authorities have reached a principled agreement. This news has not yet been officially confirmed by the French government. It is claimed that Japan will designate two zones of influence in Vietnam: one near the Chinese border in the Tonkin region, and another near the Thai border in the eastern Pursat region. The remaining areas will remain under French sovereignty, but Japan may exert some form of control, although this is uncertain. It is further reported that Japan will obtain an air base in Hanoi.

<p>(London): London issued its second air raid alarm at 1:06 AM today. A quarter of an hour later, fierce fighting broke out again over central London. Due to heavy cloud cover, the aerial combat was not visible from the ground, but the sound of machine-gun fire lasted for about ten minutes, interspersed with two explosions, indicating that bombs had been dropped due to the attack. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>(London): London issued its seventh air raid alarm at 1:16 AM this morning (9:16 AM Shanghai summer time) within 24 hours. Since yesterday's continuous bombing by German aircraft, the casualties among the people of London have been countless. Before the seventh air raid alarm, the continuous sound of gunfire was clearly audible from the east. Shells, bombs, and flares illuminated the sky. Three hours later, a German bomber struck a public place in the northwest of the city, causing many casualties, including countless children. German aircraft also dropped numerous explosive and incendiary bombs in central and southern England, causing a large number of casualties. (United Press, 15th)</p>
<p>(London): After three hours of eerie silence, London issued another air raid alarm at 1:15 AM this morning. Although the air raid lasted for two hours and seventeen minutes, German aircraft ultimately failed to penetrate the center of London. Londoners witnessed the accurate firing of British anti-aircraft guns, which brought them joy. A reporter from the International News Service heard the sound of distant bomb explosions, but there was no massive shaking like the previous nights, so it is believed that the damage was also slight. According to reports, a squadron of German aircraft, seeing that they could not penetrate the British artillery network, hastily fled. In a certain town in the Midlands, a group of children was holding an aircraft fundraising event when a bomb struck the pavilion, killing many. Today, British air defenses have been doubled to prevent German incursions. At the same time, two million regular troops and guards, together with the navy, are defending all locations. Should the German army attempt to land in Britain, they can immediately confront them. British army and navy personnel pointed out today that the current high tide and full moon are an excellent opportunity for Hitler to invade Britain. (International, 15th)</p>

<p>Fierce Battle the Day Before Yesterday at Dusk</p>
<p>German Aircraft Forced Back by Clouds</p>
<p>(London): The most severe air raid yesterday was at 6:17 PM, when the first batch of German aircraft flew in from the west. A reporter from the United Press, standing on the highest observation deck in London, observed the aircraft shadows very clearly. The German aircraft flew low in a loose formation, but were intercepted by the Royal Air Force. When the British and German aircraft reached the city, the most intense air battle since the start of the European war began. The reporter once silently counted 61 aircraft engaged in fierce combat in the air, all flying high at about 8,000 feet. A German aircraft soon flew rapidly towards the Thames River, presumably to drop a bomb. As the aircraft flew back, a Royal Air Force aircraft went forward to intercept it, and a fierce battle ensued, before both disappeared into the clouds. After a while, eight German bombers suddenly appeared in the clouds, but quickly disappeared. Observers estimated that the number of German aircraft flying to London was the largest this time. However, due to the tight defenses here, many did not have time to drop bombs and escaped. It is estimated that about 300 German bombers and numerous fighters invaded London airspace today, but after the British Air Force rose to respond, they were forced back. The fifth and sixth alarms were the shortest. When the German aircraft attacked for the third time, numerous high-explosive bombs and incendiary bombs were dropped. However, no bombs were dropped during the fourth and fifth times. When the German aircraft flew in for the fifth and sixth times, they were driven back by British coastal air force anti-aircraft guns before reaching their destination. It is estimated that about 200 German aircraft engaged in the most fierce air battle with the Royal Air Force. According to witnesses, this air battle was the largest since the German side began air raids. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>(London): According to an Air Ministry bulletin, as of 7:30 PM yesterday, eleven German aircraft had been shot down over Britain, and the British had lost four fighters, but one pilot landed safely by parachute. On Friday night, a German bomber, while attacking London, was illuminated by searchlights and pursued by British fighters for 20 minutes, before being hit and exploding, falling from the sky. During the second air raid alarm yesterday afternoon, about 300 enemy aircraft flew from the southeast coast, intending to break into London, but were driven back without dropping bombs. According to witnesses, about 200 aircraft were engaged in combat in the clouds during the second air raid in the afternoon. During the third air raid, some bombs fell in the London area, causing some casualties and starting a fire, but it was extinguished within minutes. The fence of a church in the London area was also hit by a bomb, shattering all the nearby glass windows. The 750 people in the church returned home safely. The third alarm started at 2:50 PM and ended after one hour and fifteen minutes. Observers on the rooftops of central London heard the roar of engines directly overhead, as well as the sound of bomb explosions and the simultaneous firing of anti-aircraft guns. During the fourth German air raid on London, bombs were dropped near a bridge. During the sixth German air raid, formations of aircraft flew high over London without dropping bombs, and anti-aircraft guns also opened fire. Aircraft appeared in northeastern, southwestern London and Wales, but did not launch major attacks. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>(London): A church in the southwestern district of London was hit by a bomb yesterday afternoon. The damage in London yesterday was not great, and the casualties were also minimal. During the two air raids yesterday afternoon, about 300 enemy bombers and fighters flew in from the southeast coast, attempting to break into London, but were repelled. German dive bombers injured several people in a certain town in northwestern England. A maternity hospital was hit and damaged, but fortunately, all the pregnant women were sheltered in air-raid shelters and were safe. German aircraft mostly dropped bombs indiscriminately and aimlessly, in order to escape the interception of British fighters. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>(London): The damage from last night's air raids was light, and the casualties were fewer than in the previous night raids last week. Some high-explosive and incendiary bombs fell in the northeastern parts of London, causing considerable damage. According to a bulletin, the German aircraft losses yesterday, in addition to the 11 previously reported, were another seven shot down, for a total of 18. Nine British aircraft were missing, but the pilots of six of them had escaped safely. German bombers launched repeated attacks on London last night, and bombs fell in various areas of England and Wales. A few German aircraft penetrated London, and most of the bombs fell in suburban areas. There was a fire in the city, with slight damage, but the fire was quickly extinguished. There were a total of six alarms in London yesterday. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>German Aircraft Pay Attention to Reconnaissance</p>
<p>Southeast Defenses of Britain</p>
<p>(London): Although six air raid alarms were issued in London yesterday, the intensity of the air raids was not as severe as before, as most German aircraft seemed to be focusing on reconnaissance of the defenses along the southeastern coast of Britain. Only a few bombs fell in London during the day, causing few casualties. According to a joint bulletin from the Air Ministry and the Ministry of Internal Security, the scope of the air raids elsewhere in Britain was smaller, but German aircraft flew around randomly, apparently to intimidate. Several cities on the south coast were bombed during the day. Apart from some casualties and material damage in two cities, there was not much damage. In Ipswich in the afternoon, a church and several houses were destroyed by German aircraft, but there were few casualties. (Reuters, 15th)</p>

<p>(London): From dusk on the 13th to 5:00 AM yesterday morning, British bombers bombed the French coast along the English Channel again throughout the night. The intensity and duration of the bombing were unprecedented. As a result, ships in the ports of Boulogne, Dunkirk, Calais, Ostend, and Antwerp were damaged, and the docks caught fire. Although the anti-aircraft fire was intense, British aircraft still bravely withstood the attacks. The entire coastline from Boulogne in the south to Dunkirk in the north appeared to be on fire, and the sound of explosions shook the coast of Kent in Britain throughout the night. Yesterday, British aircraft also bombed ships anchored in a river near Rotterdam, and attacked a convoy of oil tankers near Cherbourg during the day. One ship was hit and exploded. The British lost a total of three aircraft. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>(London): The Air Ministry Information Office issued a bulletin, detailing the damage inflicted on German invasion bases in Britain. It stated that British aircraft activity began shortly after 9:00 PM on the 13th and continued until dawn. The port of Boulogne was attacked first, and British aircraft flew low and launched continuous attacks, bombing the docks and wharves in the port. Several fires broke out, and one explosion caused a red flash. The docks in Ostend were bombed for a full hour. British aircraft dropped large bombs on the ships lined up in the docks, and red and green flashes were seen after the explosions, followed by fires. Ships and wharves were also hit by incendiary bombs dropped by British aircraft, causing the fires on the outer port side to blaze. Dunkirk was attacked shortly after midnight. British aircraft repeatedly dropped bombs, hitting the basin and three sides of the docks. Violent explosions were seen in many places within the target area. Ships in the Carnot Basin and Basin No. 6 in Calais were hit, and dock buildings and railways were also hit and exploded. A large contingent of British aircraft then attacked Antwerp, dropping high-explosive and incendiary bombs, damaging ships in the canal and docks. The docks and wharves were also hit. In the afternoon of the 13th, British bombers attacked ships in the river near Rotterdam with considerable success. Six or seven oil tankers, each weighing about 20 tons, escorted by warships, were seen off Cherbourg, and an attack was launched. One ship was hit, and a fire broke out, with thick smoke rising like clouds. (Reuters, 15th)</p>

<p>Cairo: With Italian troops entering Egyptian territory, major developments are expected in the near future. Italian troops have recently been harassed by British patrols. Now that they have occupied the deserted town of Sallum, bordering Libya and Egypt, they have entered Egyptian territory for the first time. The gain or loss of this village has no military value in itself, but it is feared that it will lead to a major war. News has reached all sectors that the next few days will be a very dangerous period for Egypt, and the whole country must strengthen its unity to cope with it.

<p>(London): According to the British communiqué from Cairo today, Italian troops have occupied the deserted town of Sallum on the border between Libya and Egypt. On August 3, the Commander-in-Chief of British Forces in the Middle East announced the start of the withdrawal of British troops from Egyptian territory. Since the withdrawal of troops from the Egyptian border in the first week of Britain's declaration of war on Italy to avoid Egypt being drawn into the war, only one company of British infantry has remained to defend the military camps beyond Sallum against two divisions of Italian troops supported by artillery. Sallum has no military value. The port is small, and no warships have entered it for many years. The population is less than a thousand, there are very few buildings, and there is no supply of drinking water, making it unsuitable as a military base. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<h3 id="e22">Labor George's Prediction: An Unprecedented Naval Battle Will Occur in the English Channel; It Concerns England's Freedom and National Prestige; Both Sides Will Try Novel Weapons <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>(London) Former British Prime Minister Lloyd George recently wrote to the Associated Press, discussing the war situation, hoping that what he said would not be contradicted by reality. He continued, stating that in the English war, we have clearly approached a crisis. The aerial combat in the style of "Mill Race," watched by the world for weeks, has crossed the English Channel to London. We dare to predict that if the war continues and the cruel intentions of the people increase, this aerial war may develop into some situation. The current war seems to be taking place in the narrow sea separating Britain and continental Europe, but it could become the most massive naval battle in history.</p>
<p>The Germans are clearly making maximum preparations to invade Britain and are on the eve of a large-scale naval battle, ready to launch a major war in the sea that forms our country's important defense line. The current situation is no longer just a bluff and intimidation, but a threat that will materialize within a few days. The scope of the war will expand to hundreds of miles, and various forms of war equipment, such as battleships, destroyers, cruisers, motorboats, barges, submarines, and even those that can move from the sea into the sky, such as bombers and fighter planes, and countless previously unused cannons on both sides of the English Channel, will all appear and wreak havoc. British cannons will aim directly at the monsters swimming towards England, while German cannons will destroy the coastal defenses that form a strong barrier to prevent the enemy from landing. This war will be a war unlike any seen in history, and its outcome will not only affect Britain's own freedom but also its future power in Europe. The invincibility of Britain is an important element of this power. It would be foolish to predict the outcome at this time. What I am saying now is that everyone on this side of the Strait (referring to Britain) has a sense of serene confidence.</p>
<p>I have never seen anyone express fear that the Germans can land with the help of cannons and tanks and establish a foothold on this island. This calmness of the British may be due to a long history and the recollection that past invasions of England have all failed. However, this is just a display and not unbreakable. We must know that we are now in an era of science, and when science falls into the hands of evildoers, we cannot know what kind of evil they will create. Ordinary British people will probably not be frightened by the disaster and feel that Hitler has given us a final opportunity to win. If Hitler fails in this great war, he will suffer an extremely unfortunate blow.</p>
<p>In the past, Napoleon also had times when he did not change his adventurous ways, but Napoleon personally went to the front lines to observe the situation before deciding to stop his advance. Churchill believes that Hitler is imitating Napoleon. Hitler has not yet engaged in any attempt that he cannot achieve. This situation may be Hitler's Moscow. However, the outcome is still difficult to predict. We still do not know what new plans Hitler will use to help him cross the sea, or what the so-called "secret weapons" are. All I can say today is that the British people will fight strongly to defend their motherland. (Associated Press, 15th)</p>

<p>(Moscow) Romanian Minister to the Soviet Union, Gafencu, visited Deputy Commissar for Foreign Affairs of the Soviet People's Committee Nosov on the 13th, and submitted the Romanian government's reply to the Soviet protest of August 29. On August 29, the Soviet Union protested to Romania about the provocative actions of the Romanian military on the Soviet-Romanian border. In the reply, the Romanian government acknowledged that Romanian aircraft flew along the border but did not cross it. The reply also pointed out, "Soviet aircraft have violated the border, therefore the responsibility for this incident cannot be borne by the Romanian Air Force. However, in order to maintain friendly relations with the Soviet Union, the Romanian government has decided to strictly prohibit Romanian aircraft from flying in the connected areas of the Soviet-Romanian border starting from September 1. In the reply, the Romanian government denied that the border incidents were caused by the Romanian border guards and regular army, claiming that the border incidents were caused by the actions of the Soviet border guards. But in order to maintain the most friendly relations with the Soviet Union, the General Staff has strictly prohibited the military from using weapons, unless Romanian territory is invaded." Mr. Nosov accepted the reply and promised to forward the contents to the Soviet government. (TASS News Agency, 15th)</p>

<h3 id="e30">From Paris to Bordeaux <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>The following is a report from a reporter for the American "Life" weekly pictorial magazine:</p>
<p>France was not conquered in forty-three days; it collapsed in forty-three days. The French defeated themselves; they themselves understand this point.</p>
<p>What France encountered was the result of ten years of French social and political history. If there were less bewildering news, the world might have been prepared for this shocking event and not be caught completely off guard. Therefore, in this respect, there is somewhat of a sense of internal betrayal.</p>
<p>The French people are generally good people. They may be too cultured, too focused on eating and chatting, and have forgotten how to work. Spending two hours on lunch still happens until the end. As an old lady said, "We are all responsible for this terrible event. France needs a lesson, but this lesson is the most cruel." The most important crime for which the French are now being punished is their long-term tolerance of foolish, corrupt, and hopeless bureaucrats running the government.</p>
<p>France's final collapse began on June 9 when the government withdrew from Sceaux. The speed and scope of the moral, economic, and military disintegration were extremely alarming. For almost two weeks, we did not hear anyone mention the German army. All we could hear were many blaming accusations, explaining who should bear the blame for the failure. The army felt disgusted with the people, the government, and the officials. The people felt the same disgust with the army, the government, and the officials. The government and officials were obviously only concerned with themselves and only thinking about how to escape. Everyone was lazy, disheartened, and furious, anticipating that the situation would become increasingly dangerous.</p>
<p>All reports acknowledge that the French army officers failed their soldiers and their country. We have seen countless officers mixed among the refugees, evacuating their wives and families. We also saw deserters mixed among the refugees along the road from Tours, soldiers with their families, and military vehicles carrying civilians.</p>
<p>Our clearest impression is that there was no fierce battle after the fall of Paris. We actually did not see any wounded soldiers, which clearly shows that the German advance was very fast. Compared to the number of troops participating in the war, the number of casualties was frighteningly small. Bombing is a terrible tactic, but compared to the continuous and intense artillery fire of the last war, it is just child's play. There was no machine-gun fire on the refugee escape routes, only a few bombings of important targets. Apart from some refugees being killed on military roads in northern France, there was no news of the Germans being so horrible.</p>
<p>The myth that the French army fought back to the wall before fighting is just a myth. Most of the French army did fight hard, and thousands of French officers were loyal and reliable. But the claim that the French army is the best in the world has become an illusion. Individual laziness, as is generally said, is not a manifestation of democracy, but a manifestation of laxity and lack of preparation. The army was unprepared, the armaments were unprepared, and the authorities were even more unprepared. Morale on the front lines was indeed high, but once a large army began to collapse, it was irreversible.</p>
<p>The reporter does not believe that the complete annihilation of the 9th Army led by General Corap in the Sedan area was an exception. Five months ago, officers of the 9th Army were already talking about the difficulty of military discipline. After the army collapsed, the officers returned home to evacuate their families, and the soldiers fled on foot. Six hundred soldiers were later found in cafes in Paris. According to unconfirmed reports, one in six of these soldiers was executed by firing squad, and many officers were executed at the same time. According to the latest news, Corap has now returned to Paris to write his memoirs. It is speculated that he and officers like him escaped in transport vehicles.</p>
<p>The disintegration of public morale first appeared in northern France. In some industrial areas in the north, workers woke up one morning and found that the civil administrators, factory managers, and wealthy families had all fled overnight. Among them was a village head who detained a train to transport all the residents of the village to Paris.</p>
<p>The chaotic evacuation of Paris began on June 9. Instructing residents to evacuate only required two procedures: one was radio instructions explaining where to evacuate and how to get there; the other was the police maintaining order on the roads. But neither of these was done. When French radio should have been constantly working to restrain the gullible people from moving, it was broadcasting dance music and repeatedly broadcasting outdated government bulletins. As a result, the morale of the French people was completely demoralized. For several days, half of the French people were fleeing, and half were watching. Those who were watching could not restrain themselves later, and they also packed their bags and embarked on the road to escape, but they were at a loss as to where to escape and why they were escaping. This group of refugees exhausted the food in the countryside, and especially important, created a gasoline panic. Finally, the military and political authorities ordered a ban on refugees from leaving the country, stopping all meaningless transportation, which had hindered military operations in many areas.</p>
<p>The French government suddenly moved to Bordeaux on June 14. A peculiar sight was that fat senators in velvet-lined cars, with charming women, demanded to rush to gas stations to refuel behind miles of refugees.</p>
<p>France was not united before the war, and it is not true that it was united during the war. On the contrary, many smart French people remember that war is a very bad thing, and it is better to maintain a prosperous country and be in a weak position than to be impoverished by France's victory. This is the proposition of those who attended the Munich Conference, and it is this group of people who ruled France until March of this year. Millions of French workers, baptized by Marxism, had no reason to fight in France. The reaction to the peace news was completely heartbreaking and miserable. A soldier generously said, "All the people who lead us are rabbit-hearted."</p>
<p>On June 21, in Bayonne, just one shot would have created a bloody mess. The city was filled with fat refugees from home and abroad, with large cars and beautiful women. The French troops rescued from Cherbourg had just landed, looking haggard and starving. The British Air Force advance team also poured into the city in order to evacuate back to Britain. The Portuguese consulate was surrounded so tightly that soldiers had to be sent to guard the gate with rifles. In a word, the scene was bleak and terrible, something Americans could not imagine.</p>
<p>The following is a letter written by a Frenchman to "Life" pictorial magazine:</p>
<p>I have read your magazine's report on the situation in France and deeply feel that your magazine's correspondent has done what many journalists consider they should do, which is to draw conclusions solely from his own observations, rather than comparing them with the observations of others. The corruption of politicians in France in recent years is absolutely true, and no Frenchman can deny it. I am speaking as someone who grew up in a French family, my family is still in France, and is related to the French government. One thing that must not be forgotten is that when the French are relentlessly criticized by a strongman like Poincaré as aggressors, militarists, cruelists, avengers, and uncooperative people, while weak and incompetent people like Briand and Blum take the stage, the British and Americans praise French liberalism and do their best to flatter.</p>
<p>I received several letters from France a few weeks ago, proving that the French are not a corrupt nation, but a disillusioned nation. They have not forgotten how to work, as your reporter said, and are still working hard. When I wrote to my seventy-year-old mother and asked her to come to the United States, she replied, "Please don't think about it anymore. I have work to do in France, and I still have to stay in France as long as I can fulfill my task of providing relief to the refugees." I also have a sister who used to work in the kitchen of the Paris barracks until 2:00 in the morning every day, and she wrote to me in the same tone. Neither of them has forgotten how to work. They are precisely the representatives of countless French people.</p>
<p>The cars that withdrew from northern France were carrying the bodies of children who had died in the disaster, which is what made the French feel short of breath, but it was not the corruption of the majority of the French people that caused the collapse of France. During this period, the French are sincerely seeking understanding and sympathy from people all over the world.</p>

<h3 id="e31">September 18th Memorial, Shanghai Jointly on Alert Starting Today; Defense Forces and Business Corps Assist Police in Arrest Work; Hotels and Apartments Are Strictly Searched <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>The ninth anniversary of the September 18th Incident, the Manchurian Incident, is approaching rapidly. Although the Shanghai Municipal Area will not hold commemorative ceremonies at that time, it will unanimously observe a moment of silence to commemorate the event, focusing on spiritual encouragement to support national policies and complete the mission of national rejuvenation. All sectors will actively promote the collection of winter clothing to provide warmth for soldiers and refugees, and the promotion of national construction savings will also be stepped up.</p>
<p>All Activities Are Prohibited</p>
<p>In order to ensure the security of the Concession, the Public Concession authorities have continued to implement security measures since the "August 13th" Incident. The French Concession also began to block roads on the 3rd of this month and has not relaxed its efforts. Because the measures have been handled appropriately, the situation is good and the order is peaceful. Furthermore, all gatherings, associations, parades, demonstrations, and other activities have been prohibited since the 12th. Now that the anniversary is approaching, it has been decided to implement joint security measures starting today based on the decisions made at the meetings of the two authorities. Therefore, the defense forces of the United States, France, and Italy, as well as the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, will be dispatched to assist in police work.</p>
<p>Decreased Crime, Good Order</p>
<p>Since the Public Concession adopted security measures on the 9th of last month, general security measures have continued to be implemented, and the maintenance of security within the Concession has been very effective. The number of criminal cases that occurred in the Public Concession last week has decreased due to strict security measures, which is very encouraging. However, minor cases of robbery and theft have increased by 56 cases compared to previous weeks, totaling 420 cases. Also, because the security within the Concession is strict, the number of arrested criminals has increased by 92, totaling 527. This is a good harvest since the implementation of security measures.</p>
<p>Roadblocks, Intensified Inspections</p>
<p>As for the road blocking work, the French Concession part has already been completed. Some roads in the Public Concession are still open as usual. The blockage of bridges, if the situation is good, will be implemented at midnight on the 17th, otherwise it will start earlier. However, the dispatch of defense forces and the Volunteer Corps will be implemented immediately. As for the focus of security, attention will be paid to the search of hotels and apartments, emergency searches, and district searches. The authorities will implement double-shift overtime patrols in the "badlands" of Kunming, especially focusing on roads such as Avenue Joffre, Yu Garden Road, Great West Road, Route Tenant de Tourt, Connaught Road, Singapore Road, and Amherst Avenue to prevent the activities of gangsters.</p>

<p>The flagship of the US Asiatic Fleet, the USS Augusta, has been stationed in North China for a long time. Now that the autumn exercises in Qinhuangdao have been completed, all the US warships stationed in China, except for the minesweeper USS Finch, which returned to Shanghai the day before yesterday from Qingdao, will come to Shanghai for a concentration. The USS Augusta will come to Shanghai to dock this week. The US transport ship USS Marblehead, which carried Admiral Hepburn to North China, is now moored in Qinhuangdao, North China. Admiral Hepburn himself will decide to take the private yacht Isable to Shanghai in the short term in order to maintain contact with all parties. According to reporters from the New Voice News Agency, the newly appointed captain of the USS Augusta, Mr. Fairleigh, will be officially sworn in after the ship arrives in Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e33">Bank of China Reduces Remittance Fees for Overseas Chinese <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>And Waives Telegram Fees</p>
<p>In order to encourage overseas Chinese to remit money to the motherland, the Ministry of Finance has approved the request of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, ordering the Bank of China to reduce remittance fees for overseas Chinese remittances, to sign contracts with local banks in Fujian and Guangdong provinces, and to request the Ministry of Communications to order the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau to reduce various telegram fees. It is said that telegram fees will be waived for remittances of 1,000 national currency or more, and efforts will be made to speed up the process. Now various banks have widely established branches or agencies overseas. Those already established by the Bank of China include branches in Singapore, managers' offices in Batavia, sub-managers' offices in Hanoi, managers' offices in Haiphong, managers' offices in Rangoon, sub-managers' offices on Rangoon Bazaar Street, managers' offices in Surabaya, managers' offices in Penang, managers' offices in Medan, and managers' offices in Kuala Lumpur. Those already established by the Bank of Communications include branches in Haiphong, Saigon, Lang Son, and Manila. The Overseas Chinese Bank has recently established a special Civil Remittance Department to handle overseas remittances. In Thailand, it entrusts the Maribon Civil Remittance Bureau to act as its agent. It is also heard that the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission has advised overseas Chinese that when remitting money back to China in the future, they must declare to the banks, agencies, or civil remittance bureaus operated by Chinese people that they are exchanging for national currency, and must not hand over remittances to the so-called Overseas Remittance Industry Association to avoid being misled into its control scope, the conspiracy to seize overseas remittances.</p>
<h3 id="e34">Concern from All Sides over the "Empress of Asia" Bombing <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>Ship Displays Clear Flags</p>
<p>Japan Claims It Resembled a Warship</p>
<p>After the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's regular mail ship, the "Empress of Asia," was bombed by a Japanese aircraft on the 14th, and four Chinese crew members were injured, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and all sectors in Shanghai heard the news with great concern. According to reporters from the Da Guang News Agency who inquired about the shipping industry yesterday, the location where the ship was bombed was near Oshima Island at the entrance to Tokyo Bay, which is located fifty miles southeast of Tokyo. It was found that the ship not only flew the British flag but also had clear emblems painted on it. The reason why it was suddenly bombed by a Japanese aircraft is very confusing. When the bomb exploded, the ship's owner ordered the crew to prepare lifeboats in order to deal with the incident. The situation was tense, and all the passengers on board were greatly frightened. However, the Japanese side tried to cover it up, saying that because the ship had been painted gray since the outbreak of the war, resembling a warship, it was mistakenly bombed.</p>
<h3 id="e35">Mid-Autumn Festival Today, Do Not Forget to Reward the Troops <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>Saving Extravagance to Comfort Frontline Soldiers</p>
<p>Commercial and Industrial Groups Observe Customary One-Day Holiday</p>
<p>Today is the Mid-Autumn Festival in the abolished lunar calendar. People from all walks of life inevitably follow established customs, resulting in unnecessary extravagance. However, enthusiastic individuals will save the expenses of this day and donate them to the government to be used as relief funds. Details are listed below:</p>
<p>Rewarding Troops for the Mid-Autumn Festival</p>
<p>Although today is the abolished lunar Mid-Autumn Festival, enthusiastic individuals from all walks of life in the city are mindful that in these extraordinary times, frontline soldiers are fighting bloody battles to resist the war and strive for national liberation. Compatriots in the rear should provide them with material assistance. Therefore, they have decided to donate all unnecessary expenses such as buying mooncakes and burning incense to the National Bank to be used to reward the troops for the Mid-Autumn Festival, fulfilling their civic duty.</p>
<p>All Industries Weathering the Storm</p>
<p>Today is the day for various industries to settle accounts for the Mid-Autumn Festival in the 29th year of the Republic. Factories, shops, and companies are quite busy with account settlement. However, due to traffic congestion, cargo transportation stagnation, sluggish sales, and weak purchasing power in retail markets, various industries are unusually sluggish, not as prosperous as in previous years. Some factories have been forced to suspend work or reduce production due to declining sales. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned from financial circles yesterday that various industries in the city, with the help of the authorities, are barely able to weather this Mid-Autumn Festival. If there is no turnaround in the market, it is expected that the final accounting period for the 29th year of the Republic will be even more severe. Yesterday was the weekly holiday, and today is the Mid-Autumn Festival, so all markets and money exchanges are closed for one day.</p>

<p>For Foreigners to Purchase</p>
<p>Ningbo, Wenzhou, Jinhua, Lishui and other places are full of various imported luxury goods in the market, which should be strictly prohibited to enforce the ban. It is heard that all existing prohibited imported goods for domestic sale in various shops must be sold out before the end of September. Those unsold within the limited time will be purchased by the Trade Commission or its designated agency at a given price, for foreign residents in China to purchase for their own use, or by government agencies for entertaining foreign guests. If they are not handed over to the Trade Commission by the deadline and are still sold or transferred, they will be confiscated.</p>

<p>Last night, seven leading electric bulb factories in the city, including Daming, Dahua, and Daxin, convened a meeting at the Zhimei Restaurant to discuss ways to promote overseas trade. Mr. Wang Haibo, the Chinese manager of the Global Trust Company, who has extensive experience in international trade, was invited to attend and provide guidance. During the meeting, the export of electric bulbs, such as forming an industry association, increasing production, improving quality, and standardizing products, were discussed in detail. They also planned to cooperate with the Global Trust Company, which is good news for the export of domestic goods.</p>
<h3 id="e38">Shanghai Municipal National Construction Savings Changed to Frugality Savings <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>Anyone Depositing One Yuan or More Can Open an Account</p>
<p>Savings Certificates Temporarily Not Issued Due to Circumstances</p>
<p>During a period when the entire nation is working hard on construction, it is essential for people to practice thrift and savings, concentrating financial resources so that the government can use huge amounts of funds to expand production and construction projects. It is also necessary to cultivate good savings habits among the people to foster social economic strength.</p>
<p>Implementation Method</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the National Savings and Construction Savings Movement Committee, specific implementation methods have been agreed upon: (1) Expanding publicity to make the public understand the significance and voluntarily participate in savings, benefiting both themselves and the country, cultivating a social atmosphere of thrift, and providing funds for production and construction projects, making a profound contribution to the future of national construction. (2) Organizing National Savings and Construction Savings Groups, relying on the existing institutions of the central ministries, provincial and municipal governments, and domestic organizations to promote savings policies to achieve significant results. (3) Organizing Thrift Promotion Committees, soliciting volunteers to participate in the service. Committees have been established in Chongqing, Chengdu, Kunming, Lanzhou, Guiyang, Xi'an, Guilin, Yuanling, Shaoguan, Ganzhou, Yongan, Yongkang, and other places, and incentive measures have been established to encourage them.</p>
<p>Savings Certificates Not Issued</p>
<p>The four banks of Xingzhong, Jiaotong, Nong, and the Central Trust Bureau Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau have agreed on a revised method to facilitate savings for depositors. For overseas Chinese, the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau will formulate a method for purchasing savings certificates through correspondence. Although savings certificates have not been issued temporarily in the Shanghai concession area due to environmental reasons, savings deposits have already been opened. Anyone wishing to purchase savings certificates can switch to savings deposits. Anyone depositing one yuan or more can open an account, but the principal can only be withdrawn after five years from the date of deposit.</p>
<h3 id="e39">Authorities Coordinate Vessels for Group Purchase of Rice <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>National Government Authorizes Agencies to Investigate and Punish Monopoly</p>
<p>The National Government reported that the rice price in Shanghai was being monopolized. Therefore, the authorities are determined to punish those who manipulate the Shanghai rice market. All the agreed-upon methods have been authorized to be strictly implemented by relevant agencies and organizations in the city. If anyone repeats the old tricks and manipulates large quantities of rice, they will be severely punished according to regulations. The authorities will also order the leading rice industry groups and companies in the city to consider the overall situation, overcome difficulties together, actively purchase foreign rice, and promptly dispose of it within the assessed price limit. The Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee's situation will also be carefully studied.</p>
<p>Authorities Meeting</p>
<p>Furthermore, sources revealed that the authorities of the two concessions had repeatedly discussed concrete measures to stabilize the entire food supply in Shanghai. The authorities convened another meeting a few days ago, and all key personnel attended and deliberated on the requests made by the Shanghai Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee. Regarding the group purchase of rice, it was decided to convene agents from various industries to urge them to determine the amount of foreign rice to be ordered by telegram from overseas, and to coordinate vessels for transportation. The authorities will also seriously discuss all points requested by the Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee after receiving the letter.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Transit</p>
<p>Various rumors in the rice market are merely tricks of speculative rice merchants. Recently, as the situation in Vietnam became tense again and war seemed imminent, speculators seized the opportunity to spread rumors, claiming that the Hong Kong authorities had issued a so-called "ban on rice exports" order as a precautionary measure. After obtaining this information, a reporter from the New Voice News Agency inquired from relevant parties. According to a reliable report, the Hong Kong authorities had long taken this measure, not just today, and it only applied to a portion of rice. Rice ordered by merchants for transit or other ports is not subject to this restriction and can still be exported smoothly and issued with export certificates. Therefore, there is no need to worry about the source of foreign rice being cut off. The rumors of speculative rice merchants are not factual.</p>
<p>Pharmaceutical Industry Group Purchase</p>
<p>The Shanghai New Pharmaceutical Industry Association notified all pharmacies yesterday to set a deadline for ordering rice, in response to a letter from the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce forwarding a request from the Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee for all industries to purchase rice in groups. Pharmacies wishing to order rice should submit a detailed list of the number of bags within three days of receiving the letter (with a deposit of forty yuan in cash or immediate check for each bag) for booking.</p>
<p>Evaluation Work</p>
<p>Although the Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee is currently requesting guidance from the authorities, its work has not stopped. The two members, Zhang Nianxuan and Qu Zhenhua, previously requested resignation, but were unable to be retained despite various efforts. For now, Fu Qianceng is temporarily presiding over the work.</p>
<p>Reasons for Black Market</p>
<p>Although there are hidden worries about the future of the city's food supply, there is no fear of shortage. Foreign rice from Saigon, Siam, and other places can still be continuously supplied to Shanghai. To balance rice prices and clear the source, the primary task is to clear the sources, and though the procedures are not easy, where there's a will there's a way, and one cannot give up because of the difficulty. Secondly, the unsound market organization should not be glossed over. Generally speaking, so-called manipulation and speculation are mostly transactions between firms. Before the war, the market transactions were quite orderly, with retail sales to firms and firms to companies, without any violations. Now, retail sales are to firms, and firms still turn to transactions with firms, neglecting the rice shops. Such private transactions produce a black market. The larger rice firms in the city, about twenty or so, can control the city's food supply. If the authorities can strictly prohibit transactions between firms, and make efforts to clear the sources of supply, the city's food problem will not be as serious as it is now.</p>
<h3 id="e40">Unresolved Dispute at the Lone Battalion Barracks, Heavily Guarded on All Sides <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>White Russian Guards Prevent News Vendors From Entering and Exiting</p>
<p>Gifts of Mooncakes Also Prevented</p>
<p>The dispute between the Lone Battalion and the White Russian business group at the Jiaozhou Road Lone Battalion Barracks, which began the morning before yesterday, has not been resolved. One wave subsides only for another to rise. Around 9:00 a.m. yesterday, another dispute occurred, but it was not serious and did not lead to a violent incident. The reason was that after the dispute between the two sides the day before, White Russian guards blocked all the passages outside the barracks with barbed wire, preventing people from entering and exiting. Yesterday morning, a news vendor went to deliver newspapers, but the White Russian guards refused to allow him to enter. The news vendor, not understanding the reason, insisted on entering, which led to him being forcibly pushed out by the White Russians. The soldiers of the Lone Battalion expressed dissatisfaction with the harsh restrictions imposed by the White Russian guards and immediately protested to the White Russians. The two sides were at loggerheads, and the situation was very tense. It was not until 4:00 p.m. that Major Mann, the White Russian guard in charge of the barracks, arrived. After the Lone Battalion negotiated with him, Chinese newspapers were finally allowed to be delivered.</p>
<p>Representatives of Both Sides Negotiated Yesterday</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 p.m., Yuguo Business Group Commander Henry, accompanied by White Russian Captain Mann and representatives from the Public Works Department, drove to the Lone Battalion Barracks to negotiate with four representatives appointed by Commander Xie, the vice captains of the Lone Battalion. At that time, White Russian guards were stationed on the nearby roads and around the barracks. The meeting lasted 45 minutes before it concluded. Henry and the representatives from the Public Works Department left the barracks first, while Mann remained until the evening before leaving. The outcome of the negotiations was not known, but judging from the fact that the passage to the barracks remained blocked after the meeting, it seems that no progress was made. As of 7:00 p.m. last night, there was still no report of the dispute being resolved.</p>
<p>External Traffic Still Blocked</p>
<p>As of 7:00 p.m. last night, the passage between the barracks and the outside was still blocked. All letters, items, and visitors were prohibited from entering, and telephone communication was cut off. Even the soldiers of the barracks were not allowed to go out to buy vegetables, leaving hundreds of Lone Battalion soldiers to eat only white rice for two days. Yesterday, people from all walks of life who went to give mooncakes were also prohibited from entering. Yesterday afternoon, after White Russian Captain Mann arrived at the barracks, he began to deploy security measures. Two White Russian guards with guns and bayonets patrolled on Jiaozhou Road and Singapore Road near the barracks. A team of police officers from the Public Concession also patrolled the area. Three armed White Russians were stationed in the Public Works Department Elementary School adjacent to the barracks, setting up posts outside the barracks walls and installing electric lights for long-term occupation.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Relief Zhenhai Emergency Relief Committee has received a telegram from the Zhenhai branch stating that the association has handled burials and established shelters after the war, housing more than 500 refugees. It has also set up shelters in Baojiayang, Maoyang Temple, Niwan and other places, housing more than 600 refugees. These shelters are still being maintained. Rice alone requires more than 6,000 yuan per month. Other disaster victims who have not entered the shelters have been surveyed separately and given emergency relief. With winter approaching, the problem of winter clothing for the refugees needs to be prepared urgently. Therefore, we ask for quick fundraising. The association has held a meeting and decided on the following matters: 1. Purchase 1,000 piculs of rice from the Ningbo Grain Management Office, costing about 35,000 yuan, for refugee food and general winter relief. 2. Purchase 500 bolts of cloth in Shanghai, costing about 15,000 yuan, to make 2,500 sets of winter clothing. The above three plans are in line with the needs of the refugees. If there are insufficient funds, the founders will raise and pay the difference.</p>

<p>According to the Shanghai Thames News, the American Coastal Trading Company (translated meaning)'s cargo ship Estelle "L", docked at The Bund No. 12, returned to Shanghai from Wenzhou yesterday (14th). It is heard that the ship was detained by the Japanese authorities at (Likang) while returning to Shanghai. Previously, the ship docked in Wenzhou for a week. Two days after sailing out on August 25, it was detained by a Japanese warship. A team of Japanese soldiers boarded the ship, inspected the documents, and ordered the ship to sail to nearby Likang. The reason for the detention was not disclosed, but many believe that the ship was detained because it sailed out of the port of Wenzhou, which was (blockaded) by the Japanese. After two weeks, it was allowed to load the goods transported in Wenzhou and continue sailing to Shanghai. It arrived here yesterday morning and is now docked in front of Wharf No. 3 on the Bund. When the ship arrived in Shanghai, it hoisted a yellow flag, indicating that there was a sick passenger on board, so it was subject to quarantine. An ambulance also drove to the wharf to take Mrs. Smith, a passenger suffering from dysentery for five days, to Hongen Hospital.</p>

<p>Shen Qiusheng (24 years old), a local resident residing at No. 3, Lane 774, Haining Road, is known for his violent nature. Recently, because he failed to demand 200 yuan from his grandmother, Shen Zhang (66 years old), he beat her at 1:55 a.m. on August 8, causing injuries to her chest and back. After being reported by someone who hired a car to the Huisi Police Station under its jurisdiction, detectives rushed to the address and took Shen Qiusheng to the police station for detention, and transferred him to the First Special District Court. Police Lawyer Zhang Tianyin filed a public prosecution for the crime of injuring a relative. However, the victim, Shen Zhang, was transferred by the police to the Tibetan Road Refugee Hospital for treatment, but had not recovered and was unable to testify in court. When questioned, the defendant admitted to beating his grandmother, saying that it was a family dispute and that his wife had falsely accused him. The confession was cunning. He hired a lawyer to request bail to go out and await trial. The court, because the victim Shen Zhang had not arrived, ordered Shen Qiusheng to be released on bail to return home and beg Shen Zhang to withdraw the lawsuit. Yesterday, Judge Jiang visited the court for continued trial. Police Lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated that the victim Shen Zhang was still in the hospital recovering. The defendant also did not go to the hospital to ask her to forgive him. Lawyer Fan Gang arrived in court and stated that Shen Zhang was actually injured by the accused and given a settlement. The case was adjourned to another date. Before the trial, the court ordered Shen Zhang to be examined by the court's medical examiner for verification of the injuries. The defendant was still released on the original bail.</p>

<p>The Meiling Western Medicine Store at No. 614 Nanjing Road was founded by Chen Taiyan from Ningbo. The "Tiger Bear Deer" kidney tonifying pills issued by the store have been registered with the Trademark Bureau and have a special use certificate. Previously, the Liu San Drug Store claimed that Chen's Tiger, Turtle, Bear, and Deer were imitating its products, and hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit in the First Special Court. Chen Taiyan won the case. Unexpectedly, not long after the verdict, the Xinsheng Chemical Pharmaceutical Factory opened by Han Ruiyou at No. 1, Tongfu Lane, Jing'an Temple Road, published a large advertisement in the newspaper, stating that the Tiger, Turtle, Bear, and Deer pills were "Bear Tiger Turtle Kidney Strengthening Pills." Chen Taiyan saw this and believed that the advertisement was extremely damaging. He investigated the Bear Tiger Deer produced by the Xinsheng Pharmaceutical Factory with the Trademark Bureau and found that they had not applied for registration in accordance with the law. So he hired lawyer Qian Xingzhong to file a criminal complaint in the First Special Court against Han Ruiyou, the owner of the Xinsheng Pharmaceutical Factory, for the crime of obstructing agriculture, industry, and commerce and defamation, requesting that he be punished according to law. The First Special Court summoned the defendant Han Ruiyou yesterday afternoon, but he did not arrive. After the plaintiff's lawyer Qian Xingzhong stated the case, the court ordered that the defendant be summoned to court again at a later date for further investigation.</p>

<p>Yesterday morning, two blood cases occurred in the Hongkou and Western Shanghai districts. One was Liu Ying, a salesman for the Japanese Yonghua Cloth Shop, who was shot and killed on the spot. The other was Wei Yaoxing, an employee of the Xie Fenghua Silk Factory, who also died due to serious injuries. The details obtained by reporters from the Social News Agency are recorded below:</p>
<p>Factory Employee Killed on the Way</p>
<p>At 8:40 a.m. yesterday, Wei Yaodian, a 28-year-old employee of the Xie Fenghua Silk Factory from Shaoxing, was leaving his residence at No. 19, Hede New Village, Hede Road, intending to go to the factory to work. Unexpectedly, when he was riding in a rickshaw and passing the corner of Hede Road near Binye Road, a man suddenly caught sight of Wei and immediately drew a gun and fired at Wei. The bullet hit Wei in the chest and exited from the left side. Wei fell from the rickshaw into a pool of blood. The gunman fled without a trace. Wei was taken to the Tongren Second Hospital on nearby Linan Road for treatment, but died from his injuries at around 2:00 p.m. The police are currently investigating the reason for the attack.</p>
<p>Disguised as Gift Giver, Drawing a Gun to Commit Murder</p>
<p>Around 9:00 a.m. on the same day, Liu Ying (also known as You), a resident of Sichuan residing on the second floor of No. 6, Jingyi Lane, No. 360 Wuchang Road, Hongkou, and his wife Xu have lived there for a long time. At the time of the incident, Liu was in the room. Suddenly, two men wearing blue long gowns and short jackets, carrying four kinds of gifts such as mooncakes, claimed to be coming to give gifts. They went upstairs and gently knocked on the door. Liu opened the door. Unexpectedly, the visitors saw Liu and immediately drew a gun and fired one shot at Liu, hitting Liu's right temple and exiting the back of his head. Blood flowed everywhere, and he fell into a pool of blood at the doorway. The gunman, seeing that his purpose had been achieved, hurriedly went downstairs and fled without a trace. Afterwards, the police summoned a car to take Liu to Shanghai Sanatorium for treatment, but he died before reaching the hospital due to his serious injuries. It is learned that Liu was previously named Liu Yuying and once worked for the Shanghai Charity Federation Joint Disaster Relief Association. He is now a salesman for the Japanese Yonghua Cloth Shop in the Zhengjin Bank Building on the Bund. However, it is heard that the police found various documents and other items in Liu's residence after the incident. The case is either a vendetta or something else, which is still being secretly investigated.</p>

<p>Zhou Mengyun, a local resident currently residing at 223 McTyeire Road in East Shanghai, is thirty years old. He owns a store in Hongkou and has more than ten acres of land (nicknamed "Little Tycoon Zhou"). In 1932, he married Gu Xiumei, a local woman, through a matchmaker. Gu is twenty-six years old this year, with a pleasing appearance and</p>
<p>good at socializing. Her elder brother, Gu Huanzhang, runs the Gu Chunji shoe store on Nanjing Road near Hubei Road and also owns a leather factory on Connaught Road. After Gu married Zhou, because their families were well-matched, the couple's relationship was initially quite harmonious. They have a daughter named Tanli, who is seven years old, and another daughter named Beili, who is four years old. After the Shanghai war broke out, Zhou and Gu fled as refugees and lived on Baker Road. Zhou's situation became increasingly difficult. In 1938, Gu then</p>
<p>abandoned her husband and daughters and went to work as a bookkeeper in a gambling den in West Shanghai. After Gu was influenced by this special social environment, she lost contact with her husband, and her behavior became quite mysterious. Recently, Gu entrusted lawyer Jin Naihui to publish an advertisement stating that her husband's whereabouts were unknown. Zhou, upon seeing the advertisement, feared that Gu had ulterior motives and recently hired lawyer Huang Huancheng to file a complaint with the First Special Court's Civil Division, requesting a judgment ordering Gu to return home</p>
<p>to live with him. Yesterday, Judge Mo Runhua opened the Second Civil Court to summon both parties. Both parties, accompanied by their lawyers, appeared in court to await the hearing. The plaintiff, Zhou Mengyun, brought his two daughters to court and testified that the children need a mother. The defendant, Gu, abandoned her own daughters, which shows her sinister intentions. However, according to the Civil Code, husband and wife have an obligation to cohabitate, so he requested the court to order the defendant to return home to live with him. The plaintiff's lawyer, Huang Huancheng, said to the court that the two parties in this case were originally harmonious, but in recent years, the defendant</p>
<p>at the gambling den, saw money like waste paper, so she left the plaintiff for two years, without any regard. The defendant, Gu Xiumei, then testified that she used to work as a bookkeeper in a gambling den, but now she works in a hospital. The plaintiff's request for cohabitation requires him to provide assurance that there will be no financial worries. The court gently advised both parties to reconcile, but the defendant firmly opposed unconditional cohabitation. After examining the arguments, the court ordered both parties to debate and then announced the end of the hearing, with the judgment scheduled for the nineteenth of this month.</p>
<h3 id="e54">Speculative Trading Losses: Chen Xisheng Accused; Broker Sues for Over RMB 20,000 in Unpaid Debts; Court Summons Both Parties, Each Holding Different Arguments <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>A man named Chen Xisheng, who lives in Xieqiao Alley in the Public Concession, has been indulging in speculative trading in recent years. On May 6 of this year, he deposited RMB 2,500 in cash into the Runheng Company on the fifth floor of the Stock Exchange, entrusting the company's broker, Ding Zhiming, to</p>
<p>buy and sell stocks, not spot goods, but to calculate profits and losses based on the difference between buying and selling prices. On May 13 of this year, Ding Zhiming bought more than a thousand shares of various stocks for Chen Xisheng. By the 24th of the same month, because Chen Xisheng did not express any opinions, Ding Zhiming sold all of the stocks, resulting in Chen Xisheng losing a total of RMB 26,352.25. Ding Zhiming repeatedly demanded payment from Chen Xisheng verbally and in writing, but Chen Xisheng</p>
<p>ignored him. Therefore, Ding Zhiming recently hired lawyer E Sen to file a complaint with the First Special Court's Civil Division, accusing Chen Xisheng and requesting a judgment to compensate RMB 26,352.25 in national currency. After receiving the complaint, the court opened the Second Civil Court a few days ago with Judge Mo Runhua presiding. The plaintiff, Ding Zhiming, accompanied by lawyer Na Sen, appeared in court and stated the intent of the lawsuit, briefly stating that the defendant, Chen Xisheng, entrusted the plaintiff to buy various stocks on May 13 of this year. According to the regulations, he should have stated whether to sell or retain them on May 17. If he did not clearly state, then according to the regulations, he should have settled the account by May 20. At that time,</p>
<p>stock prices plummeted. By May 24, the defendant still had not expressed any opinions, so the plaintiff had no choice but to sell on behalf of the defendant. The defendant owes RMB 26,352.25, and he requested the court to order the defendant to pay, etc. Subsequently, Tao Wuzhi, the defendant Chen Xisheng's agent lawyer, argued that according to the Exchange's regulations, when a client entrusts a broker to buy and sell various non-spot goods, the client pays a margin. If the difference exceeds the amount of the margin, the broker should immediately</p>
<p>notify the client to increase the margin or immediately settle the transaction. In this case, the defendant paid a margin of RMB 2,500. When the difference exceeded the margin amount, the plaintiff did not follow this procedure. Now, even if there is a loss of more than RMB 20,000, the defendant has no obligation to pay. He requested the court to reject the plaintiff's lawsuit, etc. After examining the arguments, the court announced that the case would be adjourned to October 12 for another hearing. During the adjournment, it hoped that both parties would reconcile.</p>

<h3 id="e61">Charity Basketball Warm-Up Game Opens Yesterday: 54-34, An Unprecedented Fierce Battle; First Half Undecided, Only Six Points Difference <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>The charity basketball challenge, which has received attention from all parties and enthusiastic sponsorship, opened at the YMCA last night at 8:00 PM in the sound of the national anthem and military music. The Youlian team led the way, and the first battle was against the Paramount team. In an extremely tense atmosphere, the Paramount team won 54-34. The first half was played vigorously, 20-14, with Youlian only trailing by six points. The tension and excitement of the battle were unexpected. It is a pity that Youlian lacked stamina. The second battle was between the Shanghai Stars and the Paramount team on Thursday night at the YMCA.</p>
<p>Zhu Daxun Generously Donates Again</p>
<p>Last night, philanthropists flocked to the YMCA basketball court, which was full, with about six or seven hundred people. This shows that doing good is the greatest joy, and everyone feels the same way. During the halftime break, a ball auction was held, conducted by Yuan Ludeng, chairman of the Orphanage. The starting price was fifty yuan, and after competition, the great philanthropist Zhu Daxun bought the ball for 450 yuan. Mr. Zhu had just bought the Sichuan United charity game ball for 500 yuan last week, and yesterday he generously donated again, his benevolence and righteous deeds are truly admirable.</p>
<p>First Half Performance Was Wonderful</p>
<p>Youlian's performance last night was outstanding. The defense was mutually supportive, and their strength increased greatly. The Paramount team was unable to deploy in the first half. After Mr. Yuan Ludeng performed the opening ball ceremony, the two sides immediately engaged. Xiao Lu made a shot to open the scoring. The Paramount team missed both free throws. Li Zhenzhong and Xu Wenkui made one shot and one free throw, taking the lead 3-2. Ren Xiangcheng and Xiao Lu made two wonderful shots, and Youlian took the lead again 6-3. At this time, the two sides kept running and the offense and defense were flying, and they fell into extreme tension for a while. Youlian has always been in the lead 7-5, 8-7, 10-9. After Lu Shungen was transferred in, the Paramount team gradually began to look up. Feng Nianhua was transferred in, and the Paramount team came from behind with 20-14 in the first half, leading by six points.</p>
<p>Lacking Stamina, Youlian Suffered a Defeat</p>
<p>The Youlian team members are young and strong, and move like flying, but because they over-connect, they often make too many passing mistakes, and waste a lot of balls. Xiao Lu's wonderful shots are still continuous. The Paramount team's strength lies in always fighting calmly. Although Xianglong was absent, Xu Wenkui and Bao Songyuan had an unexpectedly good performance last night. In the second half, the Youlian team's speed slowed down due to the intense fighting in the first half, and gradually fell behind. The Paramount team was on the rise, Bao Songyuan, Feng Nianhua, Xu Wenkui, joined forces to attack, and the score difference gradually increased. The final result was 54-34.</p>
<p>Hope the Audience Strictly Observes Order</p>
<p>The audience in yesterday's game often blamed the referee, and there were whistles and criticisms of the players' performances of both sides, which were inappropriate. It should be known that the players and the audience are all serving charity. So-called victory is certainly gratifying, and defeat is not humiliating. It is appropriate to strongly support. Even if we put aside the charitable stance, this kind of hissing sound also represents psychological immaturity. We sincerely hope that from now on, we will be calm and aim to appreciate the skills of the game, then the order will not be disrupted.</p>

<h3 id="e67">The Reality of China's Bumper Harvests Over the Past Three Years <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Huazhang</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "Food is the paramount necessity of the people," and "Years of famine lead to chaos under heaven, while years of abundant harvests bring peace to the world." This adequately illustrates the importance of grain in normal times. As for wartime, its importance is a hundredfold greater than in peacetime. Therefore, the ancients, in discussing warfare, placed equal emphasis on sufficient food and sufficient arms, and as the common saying goes, "Before the troops move, provisions must go ahead." From the above sayings passed down through the ages, it is not difficult to understand the importance of the food issue. After the outbreak of China's sacred war of resistance, the price of rice soared, reaching over a hundred yuan per stone; while in Taizhou, only three hundred li away, the price of rice was only ten-odd yuan per stone. This can be said to be a unique local situation, a local problem. The above examples are sufficient to prove that China's food supply is by no means insufficient; however, due to a lack of management, we cannot deny it.</p>
<p>Let's look at Free China. Since the beginning of the war of resistance three years ago, we have had bumper harvests every year, and the extent of these harvests has been increasing year by year. Therefore, based on the facts of the bumper harvests over the past three years, the public's previous views on the food issue must be revised. In other words, China's food supply is not a problem; moreover, there is even a surplus. Now, let's consider the rice production in the provinces of Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan. According to Mr. Zhang Xinyi's calculations, Sichuan province produces 17,491,000 dan of rice, with a consumption of 11,894,600 dan, leaving a surplus of 5,345,000 dan. In the case of Guizhou province's rice production, the reason for [illegible] is that some consumers prefer foreign rice and wheat, as the quality of some foreign rice and wheat is better than that of domestic rice and wheat, suiting the tastes of those who lead a luxurious lifestyle. Therefore, ports such as Shanghai, Ningbo, Guangzhou, and Tianjin are all important ports for the import of foreign rice, while the inland areas do not have the habit of eating foreign rice. Currently, the price of domestic rice in Shanghai is sixty to seventy yuan per stone, which is entirely the result of special circumstances. In places like Ningguo, Zhejiang, although foreign rice and wheat are imported every year, it cannot be said that this indicates a shortage of food in China. The reason for this is, on the one hand, the inconvenience of transportation, making it easier for coastal provinces to purchase foreign rice than domestic rice from the interior; on the other hand, the severity of the food problem is actually not that great. Because China is an agricultural country, with [illegible] resources, it cannot be compared with an industrial country or a country with scarce resources. Guizhou produces 7,523,000 dan of rice, with a consumption of 3,684,000 dan, leaving a surplus of 683,000 dan. Yunnan produces 16,251,000 dan of rice, with a consumption of 18,143,000 dan, leaving a surplus of 8,208,000 dan. As a result of the bumper harvests every year, the actual harvest should be higher than this average figure; moreover, as the government authorities advocate increased production and improved seeds, the yield will certainly increase significantly.</p>
<p>What are the achievements of the bumper harvests in the past three years? According to a survey conducted by the Central Agricultural Experiment Station in the provinces of Ningxia, Qinghai, Gansu, and Shaanxi in the Northwest; Henan, Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi in Central China; Zhejiang, Fujian, and Shandong along the coast; and Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou in the Southwest, covering a total of fourteen provinces and five hundred and sixty-nine counties, the statistics on the production situation in the twenty-eighth year [of the Republic, i.e. 1939] are as follows:</p>
<p>What is particularly commendable is that the total harvest of the above fourteen provinces in the twenty-eighth year was much higher than the average figures for the seven years from the twentieth to the twenty-sixth years [of the Republic, i.e. 1931-1937]. The increased quantities were: 57,947,000 dan of japonica rice; 4,723,000 dan of sorghum; 1,244,000 dan of [illegible]; 7,500,000 dan of [glutinous rice]; 3,965,000 dan of maize; 2,546,000 dan of soybeans; 56,832,000 dan of sweet potatoes; 1,033,000 dan of cotton; 2,340,000 dan of peanuts; 640,000 dan of sesame seeds; 7,274,000 dan of tobacco; 27,890,000 dan of wheat; and 7,261,000 dan of barley. Among the total harvests in the twenty-eighth year, only glutinous rice decreased, with a shortage of 952,000 dan compared to the average quantity from the twentieth to the twenty-sixth years. (Note: 1 dan = 110.231 pounds) What about this year? The severe drought at the beginning of June, to be honest, made many people worried, and made the people living in the mountains indescribably anxious. Fortunately, Heaven had eyes, and from June 30th, widespread rain began. This timely rain, from Gansu and Shaanxi in the north to Yunnan and Guangxi in the south, was widely distributed. Sufficient rainfall in July completely dispelled people's worries about the drought. In the telegraph received on July 16th [illegible] in Yang County reported that due to the timely rain in Diezhou, this year's harvest can be expected to be [illegible] (the so-called ten percent bumper harvest is purely theoretical). Except for Sichuan province, other provinces have no worries about crop failures. Provinces such as Guizhou and Yunnan, which used to have crop failures, will also have bumper harvests this year. The annual harvests in Hunan, [illegible], Fujian, Guangxi, and Guangdong are even better, and the situation in the provinces of Hebei and [illegible] in the north is also quite promising. A telegram received on August 7th stated that, in general, the amount of rainfall in various counties in central Shaanxi was appropriate, the summer harvest was abundant, and a bumper autumn harvest is also expected. [illegible] telegram from a certain place in Shandong on August 8th [illegible] Shandong is a rice-producing area. Since the beginning of the war, the weather has been favorable, and an early harvest has been reported. The [illegible] has already been sown, and farmers are celebrating. 2. A telegram from Changsha on August 9th: 1. This year, the rainfall is favorable, and Hunan province is celebrating another bumper harvest. Counties around Dongting Lake, such as Huarong and Xiangyin, have already begun harvesting. Local troops are helping farmers to harvest rice, which is a sign of victory. 2. All of this is sufficient to illustrate the abundant harvest of food in China this year.</p>
<p>According to reports from the Central Agricultural Experiment Station, the summer harvests of Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Jiangxi, Guangxi, Hubei, Ningxia, Qinghai, Gansu, Shaanxi, Jiangxi, Guangdong, Fujian, and Zhejiang, fourteen provinces can reach 70% of the best harvest year: 91,850,000 dan of [rice]; 23,565,000 dan of [rice]; 36,005,000 dan of other [grains]; 19,814,000 dan of peanuts; 9,434,000 dan of tobacco; 51,791,000 dan of glutinous rice; 23,790,000 dan of sorghum; 66,775,000 dan of grains; 5,725,000 dan of cotton; 7,736,000 dan of sesame; 231,976,000 dan of sweet potatoes. As for the quantity of winter harvest, it is estimated as follows: 202,184,000 dan of wheat; 42,104,000 dan of peas; 82,037,000 dan of barley; 45,106,000 dan of rapeseed; 46,990,000 dan of broad beans. The harvest figures this year are still estimates, and the actual harvest should be greater than these figures. (Note: 1 dan = 33.3 pounds)</p>
<p>Facing such abundant harvests, on the one hand, we should be grateful for the favorable weather conditions provided by Heaven; on the other hand, we should also attribute it to the various measures taken by the government authorities. The main ones are outlined below:</p>
<p>(1) Adjustment of agricultural finance: Since the beginning of the war, the government authorities can be said to have spared no effort in adjusting rural finance. The Hankou Financial Conference in the twenty-seventh year [of the Republic, i.e. 1938] stipulated the following financial policies: (2) Local financial institutions should establish agricultural product warehouses; (3) Increase agricultural product mortgages; (4) Increase loans for agricultural machinery; (5) Increase loans for agricultural water conservancy projects; farmers can use warehouse agricultural products as collateral for loans. Local authorities have actively implemented these policies. Banks in various places are also competing to make loans to rural areas. Taking the Farmers Bank of China as an example, according to Mr. Chen Qinghua's article "Rural Loans of the Farmers Bank of China During the War," the figures for various rural loans are: (1) The total amount of cooperative loans reached more than 50 million yuan; (2) The amount of cooperative treasury loans was more than 38 million yuan; (3) The amount of agricultural warehouse loans was more than 2.6 million yuan, and later a special fund of 12 million yuan was allocated to handle agricultural product mortgage loans; (4) The amount of district relief loans was more than 8 million yuan; (5) The amount of war zone relief loans was more than 10 million yuan; (6) The amount of loans was 10 million yuan; (7) [illegible] reached more than 8.4 million yuan, totaling approximately 120 million yuan. The Agricultural Finance Bureau of China also made great [illegible] to rural finance after the war of resistance. (8) This year, a huge sum of 22 million yuan was specially lent to poor farmers. According to accounting, the total amount of rural loans from financial institutions across the country is at least over 150 million yuan. Such a large amount of funds flowing into the countryside and circulating will certainly be sufficient to promote large-scale agricultural production.</p>
<p>(2) Implementation of agricultural water conservancy: The success of water conservancy is a major plan to eradicate natural disasters. Most of these water conservancy projects focus on the northwestern provinces. For example, the Mei-Hui [illegible] in Shaanxi irrigates 200,000 mu of farmland, and the Luo-Hui-Liang [illegible] irrigates 500,000 mu of farmland.... In recent years, water conservancy projects in the southwestern provinces have also continued to be carried out. The Dujiangyan [irrigation system] in Sichuan was completed last spring, benefiting more than 2.6 million mu of farmland in fourteen counties in western Sichuan; the Zhengze Weir in Santai was also completed last year, benefiting the farmland in northern Sichuan significantly. In addition, there are still many [projects] under construction in the southwestern and northwestern provinces.</p>
<p>(3) Establishment of agricultural warehouses: The role of agricultural warehouses is to eliminate the exploitation of farmers and prevent the manipulation of speculators. After the outbreak of the war, in addition to urging various provinces to promote the agricultural warehouse business in accordance with the Agricultural Warehouse [illegible] and the Provisional Measures for Simplified Agricultural Warehouses in Times of Emergency, the Ministry of Economic Affairs also managed it under the overall planning of the Agricultural Finance Bureau. According to He Lian, by the end of October last year, 92 agricultural [illegible] warehouses had been established, with a capacity of 2,247,415 shi. In addition, 27 more are under construction. By the end of September last year, the cumulative amount of mortgage loans from various warehouses was 1,000,461,58 yuan, with a balance of 358,446,94 yuan. The total value of storage managed by various warehouses was nearly 3 million yuan, and the total value of purchases and sales was more than 600,000 yuan.</p>
<p>(4) Immigration and land reclamation: Since the beginning of the war, the number of refugees fleeing from the war zones to the rear has been increasing. The government authorities, on the one hand, promulgated the Regulations on Refugee Land Reclamation in Times of Emergency, and on the other hand, sent personnel to various provinces in the southwest and northwest to investigate reclaimable wasteland. After seven months, the survey showed that there were millions of mu of reclaimable wasteland, which could accommodate 500,000垦min. In the northwest, land reclamation has already achieved considerable results.</p>
<p>(5) Implementation of agricultural education: In order to increase agricultural production, the Ministry of Economic Affairs decided to pay more attention to cultivating agricultural talent. It has opened training courses for agricultural extension personnel in Chongqing, which are undertaken by Jinling University, which has the most prestigious reputation in rural development in China.</p>
<p>In addition, there are matters related to agricultural product transportation and sales, livestock insurance, cooperative undertakings, etc., which can all promote agricultural production.</p>
<p>According to a Chongqing dispatch on July 30th, the Executive Yuan has established the National Grain Administration to coordinate the production, sales, storage, and transportation of grain across the country, and to regulate the relationship between supply and demand. The bureau officially started working on August 1st, with three departments for administrative control, business control, and finance, and two offices for secretarial work and research. The Administrative Control Department is responsible for matters such as grain surveys and statistics; the Business Control Department is responsible for matters such as grain production and sales. The initial work of the bureau is to understand the situation of grain across the country, especially the current situation of grain merchants and grain markets. Then, it will actively carry out grain regulation work, paying attention to the planned regulation of military and civilian food, and focusing on the rational distribution of land sections. It has already been said above that China's grain supply is by no means insufficient; however, the problem is the lack of management. Now that the National Grain Administration has been established and has begun to work, management will no longer be a problem, and undoubtedly, it will definitely achieve great results in management. Under the dual conditions of abundant grain harvest and proper management, China's grain problem has been completely solved, which is extremely gratifying to us! In summary, the great bumper harvest of grain in China over the past three years has made the foundation for victory in the War of Resistance even stronger!</p>

<p>— Editor</p>
<p>As for how to distinguish between blocked Marks and free Marks, I am not very clear about the details. However, I believe that if you want to receive Marks, you may judge whether they are issued by the German-British Bank [Reichsbank] and whether the face value is ten Marks or more. All Marks of ten Marks or more issued by the Reichsbank are the only legal tender in Germany, and are the same as gold Marks (in fact, there are no gold Marks in circulation). They should not be blocked Marks and can be freely imported and exported (in fact, exports are still subject to exchange control restrictions). Other German currency or drafts should be carefully considered when receiving them. If you do not distinguish the scope of their use, it is tantamount to throwing yourself into the net, and they will be blocked. In short, the so-called blocked Marks of today are no longer a special type of currency issued during the last European war to indicate their difference from free Marks. It is also not like our country's exchange drafts, which are blocked currency, so there is no great difference in form from the [regular currency]. Other [currencies] are free currency.</p>
<p>Also, I remember that you previously asked about the discrepancy in the exchange rates for foreign exchange in Germany during the war. Now, I am extracting a monthly comparison table of exchange rates from the Frankfurter Zeitung [25F], covering the period from January of last year to [illegible] of this year. However, it only lists a few countries, so I will summarize it below:</p>
<p>As for the wartime exchange rate of the German Mark against the pound sterling overseas, it can be observed in the New York market's German exchange rate.</p>
<p>New York Exchange Rate for Berlin (Unit: Number of Marks per US Dollar)</p>
<p>Annual Average for 1929 4.2000</p>
<p>Annual Average for 1938 2.4905</p>
<p>Annual Average for 1939 2.4903</p>
<p>May 1940 2.4990</p>
<p>The above is based on the Federal Reserve Bulletin, July 1940.</p>
<h3 id="e69">About the Czech Currency <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>— Editor</p>
<p>To Zhao Zhong [illegible], regarding your questions about the currency unit of Czechoslovakia, its current market price, and its ratio to the legal tender, here are brief answers based on what is known:</p>
<p>The Czech standard currency is [illegible] Kuruna, cast from [illegible] and bronze. Refer to the World Currency System Table attached to my Financial and Monetary Dictionary, which was published by the World Book Company in the 26th year of the Republic [1937].</p>
<p>Since Czechoslovakia was annexed by Germany, the Czech currency system has also been unified with the Mark. Therefore, the [illegible] market's records of Czech exchange rates ceased to exist after March of last year. According to the Federal Reserve Bulletin, Jan. 1904, the recent exchange rate of the Czech currency in New York is (US cents per Koruna):</p>
<p>Annual Average for 1929 2.9609</p>
<p>Annual Average for 1933 3.8232</p>
<p>Annual Average for 1936 4.0078</p>
<p>March 1938 3.4245</p>
<p>As for its exchange rate against the legal tender, it can be calculated by [illegible]. The average exchange rate of the US dollar against Shanghai currency in March 1938 was US$0.16016 per 1 yuan legal tender, then the chain method can be used to obtain an approximate black market exchange rate of 0.2 yuan legal tender equal to 1 Czech Koruna.</p>
<p>In [illegible] there are always [illegible] Czech expatriates, so Czech currency may have some [illegible] market that is not seen in Shanghai [illegible].</p>
<h3 id="e70">Seven Questions About Public Debt <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>— Editor</p>
<p>To Liu Qi, responding to your questions:</p>
<p>(1) Public debt is difficult to be priced below the face value, but the principal and interest are calculated at the full face value. Therefore, the issuance of public debt should be fully raised; however, there is usually a few points of discount, one is to encourage people to buy, and the other is to [illegible] handling fees for banks, etc. Therefore, whether subscribing or allocating, it should be handled in accordance with the issuance regulations. When a bank purchases debt from the government, it is because the government uses public debt to borrow from the bank, then the amount of the loan should change with the market debt. Because subscribing to public debt is a long-term investment; while a bank accepting public debt as collateral is a short-term loan. Since it is a short-term loan, it should be considered how much capital can be recovered. If calculated at a high price, even if the government does not redeem it upon maturity, the bank can sell it on the market without loss. This situation is the same at home and abroad. There is no discrimination against various creditors at the time of issuance.</p>
<p>(2) The market price of public debt is purely determined by the subjective psychology of the market: there is no pricing standard. Because its reasonable standard, [illegible], there is nothing else besides the face value. However, people in the market often speculate based on the proximity of the principal and interest repayment period, the ratio of various debt market prices that are constantly maintained, etc.; this can only calculate how much the interest on investment or speculation is, and cannot determine the market price.</p>
<p>(3) Before the August 13th Incident, the government was worried about being disrupted by others due to the rising prices of various debts at that time, so it had set a minimum price limit. Above the price limit, it could still rise and fall freely. At that time, the minimum price limit written on the [illegible] was 76 yuan for Class A, 73 yuan and 5 jiao for Class B, 70 yuan and 5 jiao for Class C, and 70 yuan for Class D [illegible] two types. Your letter mentioned 60%, I am afraid it is wrong. This decree is still valid today, but it cannot be implemented at present due to the special environment in Shanghai.</p>
<p>(4) If a country suddenly has a foreign war, people will inevitably be panicked. As a result, the market is inevitably chaotic. In order to avoid such unnecessary fluctuations and to enable the economic community to calmly transition from a peaceful system to a wartime system, governments of various countries often order the suspension of operations of various centralized markets (such as exchanges) at the beginning of the war. Therefore, moments before the August 13th Incident, the government ordered the suspension of operations of various exchanges. The stock exchange was no exception; because debt credit is related to the national treasury credit, therefore, various countries, even if they allow other transactions to resume operations during the war, do not allow the stock exchange to resume operations until the war is over. If there is a black market, there is no attempt to ban it. Because of the existence of Shanghai, our country cannot only eliminate the black market, but also has to tacitly acknowledge the openness of its black transactions. The open entry of black transactions from the building of the Zhouye Bank to the building of the Stock Exchange may have been tacitly approved by the financial authorities? In our guess, the financial authorities may have to tacitly approve it for the following three reasons. First, since the national financial resources are so strong, they are not afraid of not being able to maintain [illegible] credit. Looking at the market [illegible] prices, they have been rising steadily since the opening of black transactions. Second, I firmly believe that there are many people in the stock exchange who understand the righteousness; although there are also some unscrupulous people who, only for their own speculative interests, are willing to go short and spread news that is unfavorable to the debt market in an attempt to lower the debt price. However, their power is not great, and they are far from being able to match the bulls. They are just for sacrifice. Third, the biggest reason for the government's tacit approval of the opening of black transactions may be that the relationship between purchasing, trading, and the financial market is too deep, because the financial sector increases the purchase of public debt as the main means of processing its deposits. Because purchasing public debt is like passing on the interest on customers' deposits to the national treasury, and more spillover interest can be obtained. If the stock exchange market does not resume, the financial sector will lose its portal for turning over capital. The government's tacit approval of the opening of black transactions is understandable.</p>
<p>(5) The [illegible] fall in debt prices, whether in peacetime or wartime, is always related to the tightness of market funds (ie silver), except for pure speculation. Its influence by the foreign exchange and gold markets is nothing more than this. Whenever speculation in the foreign exchange and gold markets is fierce, funds flow from the debt market to the foreign exchange and gold markets; conversely, they flow back. In this outgoing or incoming situation, the balance of supply and demand in the debt market is disrupted; the debt market then fluctuates. Other associations are nothing more than the [illegible] attachments of speculators.</p>
<p>(6) According to the regulations of the stock exchange before the war: the deposit margin for each 10,000 yuan face value of various debt markets was 600 yuan for the stock, and 800 yuan to 900 yuan for the stock, and 400 yuan for each 10,000 stock of the 1937 National Debt and 400 yuan for each 10,000 stock for the special stock, and the commission must be at least 1/1000 of the transaction amount. Entrusting a bank to purchase on behalf of is limited to spot goods. Therefore, there is no need for a margin, and at most a few handling fees are charged, and the actual rate must be smaller than the broker's commission.</p>
<p>(7) Purchasing public debt is superior and reliable compared to other investments. Today, it is often said that foreign exchange swaps often reach seven or eight points, but in fact, the interest rate of public debt often reaches seven or eight points or even 1 jiao and 5 points, the only difference is that this is a long-term investment. If used for speculation, the profit is also not small. Each money house often collects [illegible] public debt when the market supply exceeds demand, and its price must be low, but the price of public debt must rise, because it not only has the national treasury as the background, but can also request mortgage discount at any time. At present, each bank and money house have a background, because they all have huge amounts of public debt, and they must maintain the price of public debt in order to maintain the value of their reserves. If you are worried about the future of the money house, the people in the money house will laugh at your excessive loyalty.</p>

<h3 id="e71">Financial Review <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>

<p>— September 14</p>
<p>Japanese Exchange Rates and Trade</p>
<p>The Japanese exchange rate has always maintained the benchmark of one shilling and two pence against the British pound. In August 1939, the situation in Europe became tense and war was declared. The pound [illegible] fluctuated, and its exchange rate against the US dollar fell from 4 yuan 6 jiao 8 fen to 3 yuan 8 jiao 2 fen. Japan, which was closely linked to the pound sterling, also saw its exchange rate against the US dollar fall sharply. Therefore, the exchange rate of 23 yuan and 7/16 was temporarily adopted against the US dollar, which was calculated based on the then legal exchange rate of 4.02 of the Bank of England. On October 25, it officially broke away from the pound sterling and linked to the US dollar. The biggest reason for the change at that time was that the soaring prices had become a serious problem. In order to prevent inflation, it was necessary to stabilize the exchange rate. At the same time, in order to import a large amount of military supplies from the United States, it was necessary to stabilize the US dollar exchange rate at a fixed level to avoid soaring import prices.</p>
<p>However, with the evolution of the British war, it continued to decline, which was quite unfavorable to Japan. Japan's international trade has a surplus with the pound sterling bloc and a deficit with the US dollar bloc. However, in recent years, exports to the pound sterling bloc have gradually decreased, and drafts to the US dollar bloc have gradually increased. This trend has become more apparent after the long-term European war. On the 13th of this month, Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka [illegible] recognized in the Japan Trade Association: 1. The European war has greatly reduced Japan's export trade, and the deterioration of relations with the United States has made the problem of obtaining major goods increasingly difficult. 2. Japan must pay in cash for goods purchased from the United States. If the pounds sterling earned in the pound sterling bloc cannot be freely exchanged for US dollars, it will be difficult for Japan to plan the funds needed to purchase military materials. At the same time, because the yen is linked to the US dollar, exports to the pound sterling bloc are greatly restricted by the high exchange rate. Because trade in the pound sterling bloc has always been able to buy Japanese goods at a market price of one shilling and two pence per yen, now it has to be purchased at a market price of one shilling and six pence (the market price in May and June this year) [illegible]. The value of Japanese goods in the pound sterling bloc has increased, which will naturally affect sales and lead to a decline in exports.</p>
<p>Since the UK strengthened exchange control on July 18, the free pound was equivalent to the legal pound around mid-August. As a result, the yen exchange rate also returned to its previous level of one shilling and two pence on August 14, and the London exchange rate against Japan also repeatedly fell to a purchase price of one shilling and two pence on the same day. In theory, the movement of the yen exchange rate this time should be beneficial to Japan's export trade, but the end [illegible] in Foreign Minister Matsuoka's remarks, under the circumstances of the United Kingdom's strict exchange control, Japan's export trade is still pessimistic. (End)</p>
<h3 id="e72">Pound Sterling Stabilizes, Indian Silver Reports Small [Price Changes] <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>A New York telegram on the 14th: The situation of the pound sterling in the foreign exchange market remains stable. It opened at 4 yuan 03 and a half fen in the morning, and then reached 4 yuan 04 fen. However, the result was no different from the previous day. The closing price was still 4 yuan 03 fen 75.</p>
<p>A Bombay telegram on the 14th: The silver market trend is tired, and the result [illegible] each fell two annas in September, and [illegible] fell a small anna in October. The number of transactions totaled [illegible] five. Also, the British and American silver markets both reported no market.</p>
<h3 id="e73">Exchange Rates Across Regions <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Recently, for remittances to various regions from banks in this city, except for the Bank of China and Bank of Communications remitting to Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou provinces, which, according to the Ministry of Finance's order, are remitted through Chongqing, Kunming, and Guiyang, receiving legal tender. For example, if Shenjiao remits 10,000 yuan, Chongqing receives 10,000 yuan in legal tender, while other banks generally offer around an 80% rate, meaning Shenjiao remits 8,000 yuan in legal tender, and Chongqing receives 10,000 yuan in legal tender. Kunming, Guiyang, and other places are the same as Chongqing. As for commercial firms advertising for remittances with fee subsidies, it is reported that they only subsidize a little over ten yuan per hundred yuan, with a premium smaller than that of ordinary commercial banks. Furthermore, bank remittances are more secure and faster. Remitters should take note.</p>
<p>According to news on exchange rates, most are at par. However, for large sums, a premium of four or five yuan per thousand yuan may be offered. For example, if Shenjiao remits 1,000 yuan in legal tender, Fuzhou may receive 1,005 yuan. Xi'an in Shaanxi is at a 90% rate, meaning Shenjiao remits 90 yuan in legal tender, and Xi'an receives 100 yuan. Remittances to Tianjin and Beijing require Shenjiao to remit 1056 yuan in legal tender and Tianjin receive 100 yuan. Hankou is at par, meaning Shenjiao remits 100 yuan in legal tender, and Hankou receives 100 yuan in legal tender.</p>

<p>Since the opening price of black melon seeds loosened, due to this year's poor harvest, the production price could not be too low, and the source became scarce, so the price rebounded. Recently, Chengzi opened at 82.5 to 83 yuan, and real seeds at 79.5 yuan. Even smaller sizes have risen two or three yuan, it is said.</p>

<p>— Xiao Kangshi</p>
<p>Also a Few Pieces of Refreshing Admonitory Medicine</p>
<p>Every year there is a Mid-Autumn Festival, but only the Mid-Autumn Festivals of these past four years have felt indescribable. Anywhere outside the isolated island must be in a particularly miserable state in tonight's eyes of Chang'e. At the same time, seeing the prosperous islanders still living in their dream, it truly makes her – Chang'e – feel so many emotions!</p>
<p>On the night of the Mid-Autumn Festival, the island residents who are intoxicated in their lives, of course, will make grand displays, eating festival wine, worshiping the moon, playing this extravagant custom, without considering saving some financial resources for the country. Now, just talking about seasonal foods for Mid-Autumn Festival, like mooncakes, lotus roots, pears, persimmons, water chestnuts, and things of that nature, they contain the meaning of cautioning against the general illnesses of people today! They are also a few pieces of refreshing admonitory medicine! So I have to write it down below to tell the readers:</p>
<p>Mooncakes: Mooncakes are cut open to be eaten, symbolizing that if a country were to perish, it would be divided by the strong, just like a mooncake! But the fillings inside the mooncakes are of different kinds and are divided into many kinds of yellow, black, blue, and white colors. Here, it can represent the conscience of modern people, just like mooncakes. Although the outer shells are the same color, their contents must be distinguished by their goodness, badness, black, and white. Therefore, when everyone eats mooncakes, they should also examine themselves and see which color their conscience is similar to in the mooncake fillings – white or black?</p>
<p>Lotus Root: According to medicinal properties, lotus root tastes sweet, is neutral in nature, non-toxic, resolves heat toxins, and does not produce insects when eaten with honey. In this era of ardent and vicious hearts, everyone can eat their fill of lotus root to remove ardent and vicious thoughts.</p>
<p>Pear: Pear tastes sweet, is cold in nature, non-toxic, enters the heart and liver meridians. The heart meridian is prone to guest heat, so people without determination can eat a raw pear to expel guest heat from the heart meridian, to avoid being blinded by profit and falling into a state of confusion, ultimately becoming incurable.</p>
<p>Persimmon: Persimmon tastes sweet and astringent, is cold in nature, non-toxic, and clears the ears and nose. Therefore, people who have lost their hearing can eat persimmons to restore their reason, listen to the cries of the disaster-stricken people in the fields, and smell the fragrance and foulness of people's nature, in order to make standards for closeness and distance.</p>
<p>Water Chestnut: The color of water chestnut, with a red shell and white flesh, indicates that people today should know that, like the composition of water chestnut, the inner heart must be pure white and spotless.</p>
<h3 id="e83">Red Bean Flower Knitting Method <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>— Ni Xiuyue</p>
<p>Knit into a short, high-necked, fitted woolen coat that is extremely light, beautiful, and pleasing to the eye.</p>
<p>The early autumn air is sometimes cold, sometimes warm, and woolen coats are the most beloved garment of ladies. Red bean flowers are a beautiful and pleasing pattern. If they are used to knit a short, high-necked, fitted woolen coat, it will be truly light, warm, beautiful, and lovely. It is perfect for wearing in early autumn. Such a coat uses very little material, about seven strands of fine wool are enough. The knitting method is as follows…</p>
<p>First row: Add one stitch, purl one stitch, knit three stitches, cast off one stitch with seven stitches (knit one, purl one, knit one, purl one, knit one, purl one, knit one). Knit three stitches, yarn over one stitch, add one stitch, knit one stitch.</p>
<p>Second row: Knit all stitches, knit seven stitches released in the above row together.</p>
<p>Third row: Knit one stitch, add one stitch, purl one stitch. Knit five stitches, yarn over one stitch, add one stitch, knit two stitches.</p>
<p>Fourth row: Knit all stitches.</p>
<p>Fifth row: Knit one stitch, add one stitch, purl one stitch. Knit one stitch, yarn over one stitch, add one stitch, knit three stitches.</p>
<p>Sixth row: Knit all stitches.</p>
<p>Seventh row: Knit three stitches, add one stitch, purl one stitch. Knit three stitches, yarn over one stitch, add one stitch, knit three stitches.</p>
<p>Eighth row: Knit all stitches.</p>
<p>Ninth row: Knit four stitches, add one stitch. Knit three stitches together, add one stitch, knit five stitches.</p>
<p>Tenth row: Knit all stitches.</p>
<p>This is half of the entire flower. Knit ten rows in the opposite direction to form the entire flower.</p>
<h3 id="e84">Casual Talk on Mooncakes <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>— Tu Shouzhuo</p>
<p>The making of mooncakes has a long history. "On the Mid-Autumn Festival night, people place images of the Moon Palace in their homes, with a rabbit standing upright on the symbol. They display melons and fruits in the courtyard, and the cake surface is painted with a Moon Palace toad and rabbit. Men and women respectfully bow and burn incense, and burn it during the day." This shows that mooncakes existed at that time, but the form may be slightly different from today.</p>
<p>When I was a child, tea and snack shops sold assorted meat mooncakes. Each box contained four large ones or eight small ones, and the price was only 160 cash coins. Later, the price rose to 320 coins, and buyers already complained that it was too expensive. Now, each box costs four or five jiao, and the fillings are far less rich than they were then.</p>
<p>Since the popularity of Cantonese-style mooncakes, they have almost taken the place of Suzhou-style mooncakes, but the price is becoming more and more expensive. Yesterday, I saw a giant Cantonese-style mooncake with a diameter of one foot displayed in the window of a large company, priced at 300 yuan in legal tender, which made poor scholars gasp in disbelief.</p>
<p>Cantonese-style mooncakes have a small version that I particularly like to eat. Before the war, each one cost two fen. I often bought one or two boxes to relieve hunger. This year, the price has increased to eight fen per piece, which is in line with the labor price index of 25 cents of legal tender per yuan. In the future, those who want to investigate the prices of goods during the extraordinary period can extrapolate other items from this small mooncake.</p>
<p>Suzhou-style mooncakes are sticky and difficult to digest, which is their weakness. However, the fragrance of the clear water rose filling lingering in the teeth and cheeks, and the coolness of the clear water mint filling permeating the spleen, cannot be matched by Cantonese-style mooncakes. I am a glutton by nature, and I want both fish and bear paws. Unfortunately, I am shy of money and can only talk about cakes to relieve hunger.</p>
<p>After the rose and mint fillings became expensive, I often saw mooncake fillings being made with white sugar, dry flour, and red and green colored water as substitutes. Regardless of losing the "fragrant" and "cool" flavor, just from a hygiene standpoint, eating colored dyes into the stomach is also useless and harmful. Those who want to buy mooncakes should no longer buy these rose and mint fillings that exist in name only.</p>
<h3 id="e85">A Few Things Before Going to Bed <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>— Tian Qing</p>
<p>When night comes, I feel like my eyelids weigh a ton, wanting to close, and my limbs are weak and powerless. Once I sit down, I yawn one after another. This is the reaction after a busy day. Only sleep can make up for the body's fatigue. However, a few things before going to bed need special attention because they are closely related to physical health.</p>
<p>Brushing teeth at night before going to bed is the easiest thing to overlook, but it is very important. Because after eating all day, some food particles inevitably remain in the gaps between the teeth. If you don't brush your teeth before going to bed, your mouth will be closed during sleep, and the air will not circulate. As a result, microorganisms will multiply in the residue, causing bad breath and tooth decay. If the teeth are not healthy, it will hinder overall physical health. Therefore, brushing your teeth after eating is a must. But that seems too troublesome, so twice a day, morning and evening, is the minimum limit.</p>
<p>Drinking some plain boiled water after brushing your teeth is also necessary. Because food is chewed in the mouth and enters the esophagus, then the stomach, and finally the intestines, at the same time performing digestion. Food residue is inevitably left on the walls of the stomach and intestines. Therefore, drinking a glass of boiled water before going to bed helps digestion on the one hand and also has the function of washing the walls of the stomach and intestines, so that the residue does not stay in one place, otherwise it will have an adverse effect on the stomach and intestines.</p>
<h3 id="e86">Economic Dishes for a Week <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>— Ms. Hua Ying</p>
<p>Today is the Mid-Autumn Festival in the lunar calendar. Wealthy families will have a banquet to enjoy the moon, drinking and feasting freely, not caring at all about spending fifty or one hundred yuan on a feast. But us, economic families, even on festivals, still have to consider economy. Therefore, as usual, I will still match two meat dishes and two vegetarian dishes. One of the meat dishes is braised meatballs with greens, which symbolizes the bright moon tonight, taking on the meaning of reunion. Recently, large cabbages have been available on the market. Although they have not been frosted, the cabbage hearts have a slightly sweet taste. Red braising them with meatballs makes them even more rich and delicious. It is slightly troublesome to make the fish balls yourself, but seeing as it is a festival, it is okay to be a little troublesome. Buy a white fish, scrape off the meat, chop it finely with the back of a knife, add fine salt and cold boiled water, and make it into balls. Put them in warm boiled water and then cook them with vermicelli. If you add small diced water chestnuts while chopping the fish, they will be even more chewy when eaten. Use white soup for the soup, adding a little salt and MSG to enhance the flavor.</p>
<p>Monday Braised Meatballs with Greens Fish Ball Vermicelli Soup Edamame, Taro and Edible Yam Braised Vegetarian Ten Ingredients</p>

<h3 id="e87">Some Rejoice, Some Grieve <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Fang</p>
<p>Problems Beyond "Moon Viewing"</p>
<p>Living in a hurry, another Mid-Autumn Festival has arrived in the blink of an eye!</p>
<p>"The moon is extraordinarily bright in mid-autumn", this poetic painting will probably evoke a lot of sweet memories in us - everyone eating a reunion dinner, dividing a large mooncake, telling mooncake stories… Although such happy scenes are not lacking on today's isolated island, when everyone looks at the special-made mooncakes with price tags of tens or even hundreds of yuan displayed in those company display cases, imagining the happiness of the customers of these mooncakes, it really far exceeds our sweet dreams of the past. But the majority of the people in the isolated city are still the same; they are still worried about their daily meals, how can they have the "elegant pastime" of "viewing the moon" and "eating cakes"?</p>
<p>"...Some rejoice, some grieve?" I don't know who wrote these "Mid-Autumn Festival" lines of poetry, which precisely describes the lives of the people living in this era.</p>
<p>"Mid-Autumn Festival" is usually a settlement day for us in the business community. People owe me, and I owe others. Most of us have a routine settlement on this day. In the past few years, business has been good, accounts have been good, and all industries have spent this festival in joy. Especially the market situation since the opening of the new year this year, with soaring prices, this atmosphere is quite "prosperous."</p>
<p>Perhaps it is for the reason that "extremes beget reversals", since mid-May, the prices in the isolated city have suddenly shown a stagnant image, followed by things like hardware, yarn flowers, cotton cloth, etc., gradually declining from the high line. Due to the weakening of the consumption power of the general public, the entire market seems to have revealed the symptoms of expansion, indigestion, and unnamed diseases, "It's broken!" we hear someone calling out.</p>
<p>At the same time, many industrial factories are in a state of reduced work, suspension of work, which is the best epitome of the movement of the entire isolated city's business community! Generally speaking, companies and shops, facing this season of summer passing and autumn coming, should have been their thriving business season, but today's bleak and desolate situation has really dampened the hopes of many business people for the economic climate, On the contrary, there are quite a few who are worried and anxious about the stockpiled inventory!</p>
<p>"Opening up sources" and "reducing expenditure" will inevitably be the trend in our business community. As the "economic climate" of the isolated city changes to bleakness, reduced work, suspension of work, and even suspension of salary and layoffs, will inevitably gradually expand in the future! And as the settlement date of this Mid-Autumn Festival, which in the past has often been the season for personnel changes in the business community, we can't bear to imagine how many industrial and commercial colleagues will lose their livelihood - their jobs!</p>
<p>In this tragic development, with a spirit of mutual assistance and unity, we hope that colleagues in all industries, industrial and commercial authorities, and enthusiastic people from all walks of life will pay more attention to the seriousness of this issue, and take timely measures to solve and relieve it, which is very urgent!</p>

<p>Mending Broken Banknotes</p>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>Please allow me to borrow a corner of your newspaper to express some opinions.</p>
<p>I am a shop apprentice who graduated from elementary school, so dozens of yuan in banknotes pass through my hands every day. Recently, I have found many broken banknotes, which naturally need to be mended.</p>
<p>To mend banknotes, you need a clean piece of paper that follows the rules. On the contrary, the paper I see used to mend banknotes every day is tattered, such as small pieces of old newspaper, old book paper, etc.,... even tram tickets are used to mend them.</p>
<p>For this reason, our shop has prepared some clean white paper strips, about one-third of an inch wide, to use to carefully mend broken banknotes. I think this is very good. I hope that every shop prepares some paper strips and glue for mending broken banknotes. I also hope that people who use broken paper to mend banknotes will not do so again.</p>
<p>The Hawthorne Case</p>

<p>— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter 7 "Take him into custody"</p>
<p>Lu Jiansheng shook his head and said, "No, it wouldn't be that simple. After she explained it to me in the car, I immediately said that I would deal with him, as long as she told me his name, address, and occupation, I would have my ways and she wouldn't have to be afraid. But Lili didn't want to tell me after all, and instead advised me not to make things difficult for this person. She once said to me: 'You don't have to fight with him, it's too meaningless. I'm not afraid of him either, just let him go.' These words were clearly deceiving me, she was really afraid of this person. Because when we arrived at the cinema, she still looked uneasy, looking around from time to time."</p>
<p>Hawthorne said, "Did you see him again in the cinema?"</p>
<p>Lu Jiansheng said, "No, I also looked around, but I couldn't see him. But I believe Lili must have been killed by this Zhao.... Detective Ni, have you found out who this person is?"</p>
<p>Ni Jinzhi replied, "We only know that this person is called Zhao Boxiong--that may be a pseudonym. He originally lived at 774 Yadong Hotel, but he has now moved out. We don't know what his occupation is yet. Mr. Huo has a photo of him in his pocket. Other than that, we don't know anything else."</p>
<p>When Lu Jiansheng's eyes turned towards Hawthorne, Hawthorne had already taken out the small photo from his chest pocket. Lu Jiansheng quickly stood up to receive the photo.</p>
<p>He nodded repeatedly and said, "It's him, you can all see, he can't be said to be handsome."</p>
<p>He turned the photo over to look at it, and said in surprise, "Ah, these five words, 'Yadong 774', written in pencil, are Lili's handwriting."</p>
<p>Hawthorne still took the photo back, nodded and said, "Yes, please sit down. I have more questions to ask you. Did you use your car to pick up Wang Lili last night?"</p>
<p>Lu Jiansheng sat down again and replied, "Yes, it was about 6:30. We first took a tour around the Xianggong Ballroom, and then went to the Baimei Restaurant for supper." (108)</p>
