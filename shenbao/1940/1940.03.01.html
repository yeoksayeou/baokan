<h3 id="c12">上海法租界光輝之前途 <a href="#c12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>中國境內各租界之根本運命，決於中國抗戰建國之成敗，亦即以中國抗戰勝利，建國完成，爲最有效最妥善之保障；決於租界諸國對中國所持意念，所作行動，否是友好，亦即凡關中國之一切，以諸國尊重條約與正義，爲必然之義務。圭於租界之否泰榮枯，決於租界當局能否愛護租界內大多數居民之福利，亦即決於租界當局能否獲得界內大多數居民之愛護而相通力合作。竊信如此云云，乃爲永久適用之定律；且得於時時刻，事事物物，加以測騐，證明定律之確切。</p>
<p>經年以來，吾人屢次論述及於上海租界，且亦不能自已於藏拙而屢有所建白，或行或不行，或效或不效；顧以有鑒於租界與租界當局當前環境之萬難，故於所舉措之疎忽或失當，輒忍耐，輒緘默，遑論責備求全；於其舉措之有所裨補於界內大多數居民之福利者，則樂爲之宣揚，矢爲後盾。去歲十二月中旬，公共租界與法租界兩界當局會銜吿示，以冀制止米市之囤積投機；吾人旣申述感念誠悃，而惟處其難期久效；月以為米價僅為民食問題之一端，民食又僅為一般生活問題之一端；制止米價狂漲固已嘉惠居民，尤願租界當局更有進一步之作為。作為誠多艱阻，要在發為宏願，持以決心。迄今時閱八旬，事實說明一度決心之必有一度功效；而當前所見之痛心現象，則又說明艱阻之依然存在，決心磕破艱阻，蓋有未易言者焉。吾人對租界當局，方迷惘於同情與失望之間，突聞法租界由總領事署公表糾織怯租界評價委員會。組織章程詳刋隔昨報端。按之章程，開宗明義於此委員會之職責，乃在　『評定日用必需品之價格，取締投機操縱壟斷。』如此機構，如此動機，租界前此所未有也。明文規定『對於生產者與經銷者之權益，消費者之保護，當兼籌並顧，」可知非以權威高壓，剝削工商業者之正當　潤；是可以使界內居者安居，業者樂業。價格之評定，訂有公允而明確之基木標準，非參預其事者所得意爲抑揚。評價之準備，標舉精詳而妥實之調查手續，不容貿然武斷，不容假借便私。以容許變更評價，適應市面。以强制出售，杜絕囤積壟斷。對於陽奉陰違者，買空賣空者，業外牟利者，私設市塲者、僞證蒙蔽者，隱匿存貨者，分別主從、各予懲儆。凡此條款，非但消費者受其實惠，而守法之正當工商業亦獲切實保障。違章而沒收之貨物，犯法而責繳之罰金，則支配之於界內貧民；更見此舉絕非租界當局資以聚斂搾取，蓋無非爲界內大多數居民之福利計也。此誠法租界當局光榮之創作，賢明之措施；必爲大多數居民所衷誠擁護而馨香禱祝之以宏效卓著者也。夫若是，蘄求生活安定之人民，孰不樂居於法租界；凡百消費者，孰不樂購於法租界；正當之工商百業，孰不樂業於法租界；法租界前途之爲否泰榮枯，寗侍卜耶！</p>
<p>此非吾人徒以一時欣慰之衝動，樂予宣揚，善為頌禱，斯有的溢美也。情理有果然，趨歸所必至也。誰不樂利，更樂大利，尤樂暴利；得暴利則暴利，不得暴利則取大利，不得大利則安於微利；微利而在所必得，則積微利亦成大利，於是必得之微利尙矣，此自由而公道之正常經商原則也。不習見市廛多以「薄利多賣」為營業方針者乎，為號召之標榜者乎，其情理與此厥同。上海租界商市之當前大敝大患，在於無怯無天無良心無理由之高抬物價以攫暴利；怯租界此次之立法，即在制止無理由之暴漲。立法之後，或將使彼志切暴利者自引於怯租界之外；然市面·市屋·基業·開支·人事等等，有其自然之限制，有其必要之因素，雖圖暴利省，亦難人人遠引，家家他遷。其留業於法租界之守法工商百業，則以賣價不若界外之暴漲而門庭如市，由微利而大利歸焉，於是法租界成為繁榮之正常商市矣。顧客必趨價廉，百貨必趨顧客；若牟暴利而綑載其貨物以與顧客背道而趨，吾人誠不知其將何所得也。</p>
<p>此次上海法租界之立法，吾人斷言於其宏效卓著，顧尤願期以速效速著；則一望法租界當局以毅力魄力把握決心，二望評價會以精密嚴正共策健全，三望法租界工商業犧牲一時暴利而徐積微利爲大利，四望公共租界急起直追，與法租界並駕齊驅。</p>

<p>英商中國公共汽車公司全體銅匠司機售票二千餘人、要求戰前待遇求遂、於昨晨起實行罷工、以致各路公共汽車完全停駛、罷工工人集中廠門首要求大班答復、意國駐軍調派意兵馳柱嚴密戒備、公司對工人要求經考慮後未予接受、工部局工業科設法進行調處、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>要求未遂實行罷工</p>
<p>該公司之銅匠、前晚首先向公司提出要求恢復戰前（八一三前）待遇、未獲當局之允准、夜班銅匠首光怠工、日班銅匠亦逗留廠內、澈夜未出、至於司機售票、於昨晨人廠上工時、繼續銅匠要求、相率罷工、所有罷工工人均齊集於康腦脫路一一七一號公司廠門首廣塲、並推派工人代表六名、冒雪貯立、要求公司予以切實答復、</p>
<p>各路汽車一律停駛</p>
<p>各路公共汽車昨晨起一律停止出廠以致完全暫行停駛、計　路兆豐公園至北京路外灘、二路安和寺路至四川路橋、五路三茅閣橋至靶子路、七路南洋大學至曹家渡、九路兆豐公園至北京路外灘、十路曹家渡至外灘、十二路霞飛路至市輪渡外灘、十四路大西路及惇信路至南京路外灘、十五路福煦路同孚路至外灘、十七路靜安寺至勞勃生路口、</p>
<p>意兵探捕前往戒備</p>
<p>康腦脫路爲意軍防區、自得報後、即調派意兵、馳往公共汽車公司門首嚴密戒備、同時當地捕房亦派大批中西探捕前往維持秩序、對於集合在公司門首之罷工工人、分別予以勸導、强令離開、至於罷工之工人、值此非常時期、一律嚴守秩序、毫無越軌行動、聞該廠門首、已出意兵駐守、禁止任何人出入、（公司職員不在此例）</p>
<p>要求恢復戰前待遇</p>
<p>據罷工工人昨日表示、公司當局目八一三滬戰發生後、因營業淸淡、即於一九三八年一月起將工人待遇减低、迨至去年六月、工人因物價飛漲、生活維艱、向公司當局請求改善待遇後、公司方面允予加給一成津貼、至去年十二月、因物價狂漲不已、工人二度提出要求、公司方面、祇允發給每人每日飯貼一角五分、甫於今年一月實行、但際此時期、此數實無濟於事、遂有此第三次提出改善待遇之要求、工人此决要求各點、係八一三以前之原有辦法、希望當局能體念困難、予以接受、</p>
<p>公司方面不予應允</p>
<p>公司大班對於工人提出之要求條件、曾於昨日上午十時在公司與車務機務處各主任會商、對工人要求加資各點、認爲不能接受、故已於昨日拒絕工人要求矣、</p>
<p>意兵干涉工人受傷</p>
<p>因此雙方相持不下、延全昨日下午二時許、仍未　圓滿解決、詎意大利兵士見工人愈聚愈衆、遂施放催淚彈、工人紛紛逃避、秩序大亂、罷工風潮、益趨惡化、當塲受傷者計有十三名、曹紀生、年二十一歲、李智明、年一十二歲、殷德成、年二十九歲、嚴成華、年十六歲、朱益富、年二十一歲、周正泉、年三十一歲、劉金、年一十一歲、張士福、年二十八歲、蕭茂章、年二十三歲、何長發、年十八歲、曹有望、年一十四歲、白炳、年二十三歲、李紀美、年二十六歲、以五均司機售票員、嗣經捕房方面召救護車到塲先後分送海裕路紅十字會醫院暨愚園路底同仁第二分院施治、</p>
<p>廠內工友悉遭驅逐</p>
<p>出事後、所有在廠內工友、竟被意兵驅逐出外、廠址四週、幷宣告戒嚴、形勢殊爲緊張、該管捕房、亦派出大批幹探馳往彈壓、聞公司方面、決定今晨開駛一路九路車輛雇用外籍司機、</p>

<p>— 編者</p>
<p>答丁爵榮及一讀者兩君</p>
<p>丁爵榮及一讀者君鑒：來信及附來印花稅均收到。細辨之下，兩種印花果是相差甚遠，因特持往市商會詢問，經市商會辦事處證明，內一種確係偽造，但製版之後，糢糊不淸，依然不辨眞偽，因將相異之處，詳述如下：</p>
<p>（一）眞印花版式較大。</p>
<p>（二）偽印花中之塔影糢糊不淸。</p>
<p>（三）眞印花為深綠色，偽印花成草綠色。</p>
<p>（四）眞印花背面見硬印痕跡，僞者無。</p>
<p>（五）偽印花紙張較薄。</p>
<p>又市商會託轉告各商家，如欲購印花，請直接向各同業公會購取，如有七門兜售者，務請辨明眞偽，若發現有出售偽票者，立即扭交當局嚴辦。</p>
<h3 id="c107">「內看」國米 <a href="#c107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>— 余香芸</p>
<p>在上海，交易方面要愼重其事，由店主引導顧客到裏面去「內看」貨物的，似乎只有大藥店的「內看」參燕，銀樓裏的「內看」貴重首飾，鑽石店家的「內看」金剛鑽，除此之外，尚沒有聽到其他商店對於出售貨物要引顧客「內看」。</p>
<p>然而現在，米店裏却玩出了這一套把戲。昨天，當我探首於窗洞中向店夥詢問米價時，他們很爽捷的回答我：「頭號洋秈五十二，二號四十八。」我於是向他們說明，並不需購洋秈米，我是要購國米，請他們把國米的樣子給我看。</p>
<p>一個店夥笑着臉，連續地點着頭說：「有，有，有！請進來，國米布裏面。」接着，他又指揮一個學徒把關閉得至為堅固的舖門打開一面，讓我進去。</p>
<p>我走進了門，他又很客氣的引導我通過一道鐵柵，進入一間像賬房又像臥室似的屋子，扭開了電燈，隨着拿出許多種國米的樣品擺在那鐵方棹上。他笑嘻嘻的用指頭點着說：「這種四十八，逍種五十二，這種五十六……」說完了價目之後，停了一會，他又補充着：「這種五十六元的，貨色還不多，只好買担把。」</p>
<p>我對着那些米樣凝望，心田裏像怒馬疾奔似的跳躍，近六十元一担米，這生活的壓榨，眞要使人變成餓殍。</p>
<p>當時，我撰擇了四十八元的，購買二担。我把鈔票付給他，接着，又寫了一倘地址，囑他開張發票送去。</p>
<p>但，出乎意料之外，他們非但不肯開發票，並且，還小肯送，我於是據理力爭，質問理，由他們却陪着笑臉說：「你是明白人，市面上的情形你也蠻熟，我們也有我們的困難。」這時候，我才猜着了他們所以不肯開發票的原因，是為了避免法律上的責任，使外人對於他們破壞法令限價的舉動，無從舉證。眞可說得是聰明之至！</p>
<p>賭的敎訓</p>
<h3 id="c108">大家都輸了 <a href="#c108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>— 鵬</p>
<p>去年年底，行里的同事們發起開公司房間，說是大家帶家眷來洗洗澡，春節的假期內也有個玩玩的地方。辛苦了二年，難得有道樣的機會，自然大家願意參加。渦了年初三行里開關，本來可把房間退了。但是幾天打麻將抽下不少「彩錢」還足够好幾天的房間租金；也沒有人提議，大家「會意」地把房間繼續下去。寫字間一散，依舊擠在一起，打牌的打牌，跳舞的跳舞，而每天的「彩錢」簡直可以把房間長期祖下去。這樣一直到元宵節，房間里的人才漸漸少下來，這倒不是「興盡而散」，而是有幾位同事輸的化費的太多了，於是打牌的湊小攏「搭子」，跳舞的也沒有了「淘伴」，在如此情形乏下，自然也不必有人提議，把房間退了。</p>
<p>痛定思痛，發起時每人出費五元，結算時還收進餘下來的一份「彩錢」三角幾分，這將二十天光景每人僅化費了四元多錢，似乎是便宜事；但是每天的房金。飯食，香烟，……等支出，至少要二十塊錢，還不是大家掏腰似的？不過不是直接濤款，而是經過打麻將底繼接手　的。</p>
<p>這「大家都輸了」的教訓，使我們覺悟到：如果預先要湊集這一筆巨大的數目來開二十天的房間，是一定有人反對的，而現在是由於麻將的「彩錢一居中間人；才不知不覺地伙費了那來多的錢，這可見賭的害人之深了！</p>
<p>如果再進一步講，這筆數目內除了房金是第三者取得之外，其他還是我們每個人分同享受的，而那些賭窟每個月要繳付一百萬元的「保護費」，及更巨大的開支，試問去賭的人還有贏錢的希望嗎？</p>
<p>因之，把我們「大家都輸了」的教訓寫下來，希望存「僥倖之心」的人們作為殷鑑。</p>

<p>第廿一回　理經綸混合織維質　興機械佐成文字功</p>
<p>在三年之前，江鏡容為了視察絲識物，也會到歐美各國去攷察一番。他覺得歐洲各國，以法蘭西與意大利兩國，對於絲織物，最為考究。其他各國，便差一點了。因為法意兩國，都是出蠶絲的地方，而且工業也極為發達。他又覺得中國的絲織物，銷行到國外去，極具容易，極其順利。不過第一是絲織物商人，要把眼光放大。從前吾國的絲織物商人，只求國內的市塲，不求國外的市塲。譬如新出一舔絲織物，只要合於國內士女們的歡喜。質地，顏色，花樣，都要攷究到，人人樂用，那種材料，便可以暢銷了。此刻我們旣想行銷國外，不能不探求外國士女的嗜好。江鏡蓉在歐美各國百貨商塲，也見到他們所陳列的中國綢緞。但覺得還是少數，還敵不過法意兩國的出品。而且也只是在國內所可以常見的織品，並不是為了歐之士女們所特製之品。江鏡蓉也是那個意思，他不拒絕歐美各國的絲織品，銷到中國來，他也願意中國的絲識品，銷到歐美各國去。歐美各國，男子的衣服，用毛織物的占多數，而女子的衣服，也還是絲織物品占多數，允其在春夏之交。他和伺家兩位小姐的父親，本來是老朋友，他到北平去，為的是一家綢莊分銷的事，還為了北平一個織呢廠的事，忙了一月多。因與何先生談起絲織物的事，又知道何家兩位小姐，在美國學了紡織專科回來，大家談得高興，便组織這個織綢廠來了。依了江鏡蓉的意思，須得大規模的做一做，資金非一千萬元以上不可。他說：我們不是要做中國人的生意，我們志在做外國人的生意。在中國出那高價的絲織物，髣髴是導國人以奢華，在新興的中國，我們必須力求儉約。在歐美人士，他們到底穿得起，他們滿不在乎。又以中國工資，比較外國為康，一樣一件東西，以成本算起來，在中國的出品，至少可以便宜三分之一。因此他說：在國外貿易上，只要出品精良，投歐美人之所好，不怕銷路不發達。現在何家兩位小姐，組識這個織綢廠，也是意在推銷中國的絲織物到外國去，這個宗旨便相合了。（二四四）</p>

<p>— 金絨</p>
<p>編輯先生：見到貴刊誠君「竊米人家注意」一文，而想到在米珠薪桂的今日，對於購買煤球，亦應注意。</p>
<p>一週前，正値煤球高漲至六元八角一擔的時候，我家中煤球適値川完，便於附近煤炭店，喊了一擔煤球，當送來時借了秤，同送貨人秤騐一下，雖沒有壓秤桿的事情，但結果也短了份量，一籮四十七斤，一籮四十六斤，合計只有九十三斤，再除去二隻籮重，實際不到九十斤，與每擔一百市斤，相差竟達十斤，約合洋七角，向之爭論，彼云：「煤球由老板秤的，我是不知道的。」上海用煤球人家，對於份量向來不注意的，而他們就利用這一點，來施其技倆，平時價廉，本不必斤乎此，然在百物高漲的今日，我們非認眞一下不可，一方面杜絕其欺騙手段，一方面亦可减少我們金錢的損失，尤其像我們這般經濟人家，更何堪遭受這種意外的剝削呢</p>
<p>我想這種缺少份量的事，不止米煤球兩項，其他各物，也許都有這種情形的罷，希望能隨時的揭露他們的黑幕。</p>

<p>— 新影</p>
<p>第一要有魄力　第二要有錢</p>
<p>在好萊塢的女明星目光之　，最心愛的是那一種男人？這個問題時常有人提出，但難得獲有答案。然而最近華納影片公司裏的女星，竟獲得一個解答的機會。參加的女星一共十八位，可隨員解答的。這裏祇有一位是年靑貌美的少女，其餘所有參加者，在銀幕上都有相當的成功，在家庭中也相常的快樂。這裏把她們選擇最心愛的男人的經過情形，簡略的寫在下面。</p>
<p>參加女星一覽</p>
<p>這一次參加選擇的女明星有莎麓娜，潘覽西拉，露賽梅琳，安秀麗丹，賽麗薇哈佛蘭，瓊白萊恩，琴蕙門，潑萊特瑪希爾，亞理斯，甘兒潘奇，瑪麗絲立克蓀，瑪考脫司蒂芬蓀，羅賽兒杜妮，納妮范勃萊脫，曼麗安第蓀，琴甘兒勃，羅賽兒范朋克，梅茜洛勃蓀等，教後的一個，便是七十五歲的舞臺紅伶兼電影明星。</p>
<p>七種男性典型</p>
<p>蓓蒂黛維絲因為拍好了一部影片，在新英裕蘭作長期的休養，所以不及參加。茄利第斐司裘蘭也沒有參加，為的在愛爾　休養。為便利起見，參加選擇的女明星，每人發表格紙，上面列舉七種男子的典型就是：（一）有魄力而足為男主人者，（二）富有的男人，（三）生得很美的男人，（四）善於幽默的男人，（五）富有學識的男人，（六）做事謹愼的男人，（七）多情的男人。</p>
<p>大家愛有魄力</p>
<p>選探的結果，把有魄力的男人列在第一，表示最心愛的，十八人中竟有十人，列在第二的有五人。把美男子列在第一的竟沒有，列入第二的也祗三人。但把多情的男人列入第　的却有二人，列入第二的四人。三個年紀比較最輕的女明星，都把有錢的男人列在第一，其他把有錢的男人列入第二者也有二人。把善於幽默的男人列人第二的　人。富有學議的男人，如果和有魄力的男人相形之理，眞有些可憐，祇　選兩個第一，兩個第二。做事謹愼的男人，竟一票沒有獲選。</p>
<p>為什麼還要錢</p>
<p>因此，經過了這樣的選擇之後，就獲得種確定。好萊塢女明星對於男人，第希望有魄力，第二要有錢。也許有情人將會示驚奇的女明星日己很能賺錢，為什麽還要男人有錢呢？</p>
<h3 id="c113">攝製「紅樓夢」的小建議 <a href="#c113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>— 影迷</p>
<p>本攔前載冰冰君所撰新鐵攝製全部「紅樓夢」影片的消息，覺得很興奮。一紅樓夢」是我國舊小說中的一部名著，可以說是家喻戶曉，若以牠來攝製影片，其吸引觀衆的力量，當然十分大；但其中人物紛雜，每一角色均各有其個性，故欲選出許多能適合劇中人乏演員，實屢不易。觀此决欲在丁香花園興建大觀園的佈景，便需耗費十萬元之鉅，則公司方面之重視該片可以想見。此片之結構究竟如何，現尚不得而知，姑且不論，這裏要注意的是人選問題。</p>
<p>那麽現在讓我試擬定一下罷。首先，我以為最應當考慮的是賈寶玉這個脚色，像他那舔整日在脂粉隊裏　進　出，喜歡吃女人嘴上的口紅，而生有女孩兒家丰度的公子哥兒，假如便令常今那些走紅的男星去扮，定無好結果，因為他們都不是那種軟綿綿的骨子，不會使人起憐惜之感的；他們若是勉强描摹出寶玉的形容，我們所看到的，大槪祇是一個叫人毛骨悚然的厭物罷。請問，他們能變成一個十五六歲的花花公子麽？我相信，能勝任這個角兒的，除掉袁美雲還有誰呢，她的男妝戲我們已見很多了，我們試閉目一思，便會覺得她所有的優點，用來扮演寶玉再恰當也沒有的；况且這種噱頭，也是上海人所最喜歡的</p>
<p>蒒寶釵以顧蘭君來扮，好像不錯，陳燕燕演林黛玉似恰當些，但嫌略肥，周璇不知怎樣，尚請高明指教。</p>

<p>奚唱元板「我好比」，係用言菊朋腔，吾不以為然，一者要腔太花，無感情可言；二者板位失誤，不如老腔大方，老腔好字應在眼上，下面奚唱並無春夏秋冬，漁樵耕蘊，琴拱書畫，等詞，我說如此甚好。老詞原有這些花樣，世須用老調唱出，至少要唱王九齡調子才好，唱譚調就無鐵些累贅了。</p>
<p>若用新調唱老詞，就不如不唱，况且這唱是奏本，不是向老太婆說鼓兒詞，譯鑫培刪夫，確有高見，此下蹄着唱劉口快元板，裘盛戒奚嘯伯於末一字皆搶板唱，即大面唱至末一字，老生不待其末一字唱出，即接唱，頭一字與大面之未一字同時唱在板上，大面接唱，亦是如此，謂之搶板。此種唱法是表示熟練，然每句末一字必因此有令人聽小淸楚之弊。又如此唱法，以致板槽太快，旦角亦有接不上之苦，老角於此處本有不搶板唱法，較此為佳，吾主張不宜搶板，則三人接唱皆舒適多矣。此戲照情理講，要唱得舒適，不要侷促，使人揪着心聽人也。</p>

<p>— 龔炯</p>
<p>李秀成雖和洪秀全等民族英雄，同從金田村起義，但他的謹愼精明，智男雙全，實在是太平天國的第一個能臣。假使在太平天國十三年十一月，當曾國茶的妖兵圍困天京時，天王聽　了他的「遷都」大計，誰料得定太平天國的歷史，怎樣發展下去呢？</p>
<p>劇作者從這樣有意義的人物上，展開當時的社會現象，我覺得是頗具匠心，而月在某種程度上，還能給一般人以驚惕與教訓的。</p>
<p>李秀成從老百姓的階層中出來，親歷者老百姓們在那個時代所感受到的一切；從無可忍受的韃子的蹂躪，奴才漢奸的無恥卑劣，使得他認識了，同時也覺醒了，不反抗不打赌，不據掉坐在老百姓的脊標上剝皮喝血的壓迫者，是沒有活路的。於是，在血腥的生活中，孕育出了他的眞正為民衆解除痛苦的熱情與決心。</p>
<p>楊翰笙先生在「李秀成殉國一中，對於這個有着重大意義的發揚，也似乎抓得特別緊的。</p>
<p>在第二幕中，全民抗戰的强調，達到了那個時代的最高度。王妃親自到戰籐看護，包紮士兵的借口，柳媽媽的勉勵孫子去殺韃子，自己背了藥箱的來往照料，使我想起了現在活躍着的遊擊隊母親逍老太太</p>
<p>老百姓的愛戴與景仰忠王，可說到了瘋的程度。危急動燙的天京，忠王一回來，就像泰山般鎮定了。忠王表示了誓死不離開天京時，老百姓的高舉火炬，歡聲雷動的熱烈，不是都像發了瘋嗎？當謠傳忠王在曾營里殉國的時候，百數十戶的老百姓，齊跪在供奉李秀成靈位前悲悲切切的哀哭，又是一種怎樣眞摯與崇高的感情呀！</p>
<p>作者在劇中安置的人物，是節省到無可節省的。每一個人物，部有着凸出的個性和相互之間的密切聯繫。同樣是親羼，在主幹的李秀成的家以外的二個陪襯的農民的家，都有着不同的風貌。</p>
<p>我最愛的是在這　中，不論情勢的順逆，時機的莫測，總是充滿着一種雄偉的芬圍，這芬圍以李秀成的個人身上發射出來，照耀着老百姓們，永遠是積極的前進。</p>
<p>上海劇藝社上演這戲，希望把這一種氛圍，也帶給孤島上的一般老白姓吧！</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Japanese Army Invading Northward Along the Yongbin Road Was Bitterly Defeated by the Chinese Army at Santang. The Japanese Retreat Southward in Two Routes, Leaving Behind 1,500 Corpses. The Chinese Have Crossed Sitang and Formed a Confrontational Situation with the Japanese. <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing – The Chinese army recently engaged in three days and nights of bloody battle in Guinan, decisively defeating the Japanese and forcing them to retreat to Nanning, firmly controlling the advantageous battle situation against the remaining Japanese forces in Nanning. This victory was once again achieved by the brave Chinese soldiers. Regarding the details of the annihilation of the Japanese and the current situation, a certain military spokesperson told a Central News Agency reporter that on the morning of the 24th, the Japanese army, from Santang, advanced northward in two routes along both sides of the Yongbin Road area. Their strength consisted of 3,000 infantrymen, accompanied by numerous artillery, cavalry, and tanks. When the Japanese began their fierce offensive, the Chinese army maintained firm control of Sitang, Wutang, Liutang, and Qitang, and the Japanese did not dare to approach. They could only attempt to bypass them on both sides. The Chinese army's strength was roughly equal to that of the Japanese. When the Japanese advanced to both sides of Qitang, the Chinese army, using a pre-planned tactic to annihilate the Japanese, began to encircle them. After three days and nights of fierce division and combined attacks, the Japanese army completely collapsed. On the late night of the 26th, they began to retreat southward in two routes, leaving behind more than 1,500 corpses and over ten tanks along the way. On the 27th, they fled to the vicinity of Santang. The Chinese army pursued them valiantly, and on the same day, crossed Sitang, forming a confrontational situation with the Japanese. It has been verified that the Japanese suffered a devastating defeat this time, with extremely heavy losses. As a result, they not only failed to attack the major strongholds on the Chinese highway but also had their ability to re-equip severely decimated by the Chinese. Consequently, they had no choice but to abandon their deceitful attack plan and remain trapped in the encirclement of the Chinese's impregnable defenses. (29th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Guilin – There are no changes in the battle situation on the Yongbin and Yongwu Roads. (29th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing – According to a Chinese military spokesperson today, the recent enveloping maneuver by the Japanese army in Nanning towards the northwest of Nanning has completely failed. Three thousand Japanese soldiers, using horses, artillery, tanks, and airplanes as cover, have now been forced to retreat to Santang. The Japanese's action was originally intended to reach Batang, 28 miles northwest of Nanning, hoping to cut off the Chinese transportation line beyond Batang. Since the Japanese army retreated to Santang, the area northwest of Nanning has returned to peace and quiet. At the same time, torrential rain in that area is also one of the reasons for the cessation of hostilities. Furthermore, the spokesperson said that in the past week, the Japanese army in Nanning had extended towards Annam twice. The first time was on February 22nd, when 2,000 Japanese soldiers occupied Funan. The second time was on the 25th of this month, when the Japanese army attacked Shangsi, 30 miles southwest of the Yongqin Highway. The Chinese army repelled the attack on Funan on the 23rd, with the Japanese suffering 500 casualties. The attack on Shangsi was repelled by the Chinese on the 26th. Regarding the Japanese claim that 200,000 Chinese soldiers in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui had been surrounded by the Japanese army, the spokesperson considered it "preposterous propaganda by the Japanese," as the Chinese army's strength in that area was not as large as claimed. As for the Japanese army's casualties in this region last week, they were approximately 800. (29th Dispatch)</p>

The two sides fought fiercely for 24 hours, with the Japanese army suffering 400 casualties. The Japanese army also attacked the Chinese army in Taolin, southeast of Yueyang, and along the Xinzeng River in three locations. (29th United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Miluo – On the morning of the 25th, a certain unit of the Chinese army encountered the Japanese army in Dengjiafan and engaged in a fierce battle for three hours, repelling the Japanese.

<h3 id="e12">The Bright Future of the Shanghai French Concession <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>The fundamental destiny of the various concessions within China depends on the success or failure of China's war of resistance and national reconstruction, that is, it is most effectively and properly guaranteed by China's victory in the war of resistance and the completion of national reconstruction. It depends on the ideas and actions of the countries of the concessions towards China, whether they are friendly or not, that is, everything concerning China, with the countries respecting treaties and justice as an inevitable obligation. The rise and fall of the concessions depend on whether the concession authorities can care for the welfare of the majority of residents in the concession, that is, it depends on whether the concession authorities can gain the love and cooperation of the majority of residents in the concession. I believe that this is a permanently applicable law; and it can be tested and proven to be accurate at all times and in all things.</p>
<p>Over the years, we have repeatedly discussed the Shanghai concessions, and we have not been able to help but make suggestions, whether they are implemented or not, effective or not. However, considering the extreme difficulties of the current environment of the concessions and the concession authorities, we often tolerate and remain silent about the negligence or impropriety of the measures taken, let alone demanding perfection. If the measures taken are beneficial to the welfare of the majority of residents in the concession, we are happy to promote them and stand behind them. In mid-December of last year, the authorities of both the Public Concession and the French Concession jointly issued a notice in the hope of curbing hoarding and speculation in the rice market. We expressed our gratitude for their sincerity, but we only placed our hope on its short-term effectiveness. We thought that the price of rice was only one aspect of the food problem, and food was only one aspect of the general living problem. Curbing the soaring price of rice was certainly beneficial to the residents, but we hoped that the concession authorities would take further action. Taking action is indeed difficult, but it is essential to make great aspirations and persevere with determination. Eighty days have passed since then, and the facts show that a firm determination will certainly have a certain effect; but the heartbreaking phenomena currently seen show that the difficulties still exist, and it is not easy to overcome them with determination. We were wavering between sympathy and disappointment with the concession authorities when we suddenly heard that the French Concession had publicly announced the establishment of a Committee for the Evaluation of the Prices of Goods in the French Concession by the Consulate General. The articles of association were published in detail in yesterday's newspaper. According to the articles of association, the responsibilities of this committee are to 'assess the prices of daily necessities and to eliminate speculation, manipulation, and monopoly.' Such an organization and such a motivation are unprecedented in the concession. The explicit provision that 'the rights and interests of producers and distributors, and the protection of consumers, should be considered together' shows that it is not intended to use authority to oppress and exploit the legitimate profits of industry and commerce; it is intended to enable residents to live in peace and businesses to prosper. The assessment of prices has fair and clear basic standards, which cannot be arbitrarily adjusted by those involved. The preparation for the evaluation includes detailed and appropriate investigation procedures, which do not allow for rash arbitrariness or the use of convenience for private gain. It allows for changes in evaluation to adapt to the market. It enforces mandatory sales to eliminate hoarding and monopoly. For those who disobey in public but obey in private, those who engage in empty sales, those who seek profits outside of their business, those who set up private markets, those who provide false evidence, and those who conceal inventory, the main perpetrators and accomplices will be punished accordingly. All of these clauses not only benefit consumers, but also provide practical protection for legitimate and law-abiding industries and businesses. The goods confiscated for violations and the fines collected for breaking the law will be used for the poor in the concession; this further shows that this measure is by no means a means for the concession authorities to accumulate wealth, but rather for the welfare of the majority of residents in the concession. This is truly a glorious creation and a wise measure by the French Concession authorities; it will certainly be sincerely supported by the majority of residents, who will pray for its great and remarkable effectiveness. If so, which people who seek a stable life would not be happy to live in the French Concession; which consumers would not be happy to buy in the French Concession; which legitimate industries and businesses would not be happy to operate in the French Concession; whether the future of the French Concession will be good or bad, prosperous or declining, what is the need to consult a fortune teller!</p>
<p>This is not just a temporary emotional impulse that leads us to promote it enthusiastically and pray for it well; this is not excessive praise. There is a natural reason and the trend will inevitably lead to it. Who does not enjoy profit, and even more, enjoys large profits, and especially enjoys exorbitant profits? If one can get exorbitant profits, then get exorbitant profits; if one cannot get exorbitant profits, then get large profits; if one cannot get large profits, then settle for small profits; if small profits are certain, then accumulating small profits will also become large profits, so small profits are still valuable. This is the normal principle of free and fair business. Is it not common to see that many shops use "small profits and quick turnover" as their business policy, as a slogan to attract customers? The rationale is the same. The current major drawback and problem of the commercial market in the Shanghai concessions is the unreasonable, unconscionable, and unjustified raising of prices to seize exorbitant profits. This legislation in the French Concession is to curb the unreasonable price increases. After the legislation, it may cause those who are determined to make exorbitant profits to withdraw from the French Concession; however, the market, the city houses, the foundation, the expenses, the personnel, etc., have their natural limitations and their necessary factors. Even if they try to seize exorbitant profits elsewhere, it will be difficult for everyone to withdraw and for every family to move elsewhere. Those law-abiding industries and businesses that remain in the French Concession will have bustling businesses because the selling price is not as exorbitant as that outside the concession, and large profits will return from small profits. Thus, the French Concession will become a prosperous and normal commercial market. Customers will inevitably flock to lower prices, and goods will inevitably follow customers; if one seeks exorbitant profits and carries their goods to move in the opposite direction of customers, we truly do not know what they will gain.</p>
<p>We assert that this legislation in the Shanghai French Concession will be greatly and remarkably effective, but we also hope that it will be effective and remarkable quickly. Therefore, we hope that the French Concession authorities will grasp the determination with perseverance and魄力, that the evaluation committee will jointly plan for soundness with precision and correctness, that the industries and businesses in the French Concession will sacrifice temporary exorbitant profits and slowly accumulate small profits into large profits, and that the Public Concession will quickly catch up and keep pace with the French Concession.</p>

<p>Chongqing – American Ambassador Johnson arrived here from Kunming after a five-day journey. He arrived here just after noon today. The ambassador was dressed in travel clothes and covered in dust. Because he had not dressed up for five days, his face was covered with dust. The ambassador's party included Assistant Naval Attaché Major MacRea, Chief Justice Helmick of the American Court in China, and Ambassador's Secretary Lai Fang. They were the first group of officials to travel on the newly opened Sichuan-Yunnan Road on February 1st. Their outer clothing was quite eye-catching, each wearing a blue cloth hat purchased from Vietnam, and several of them had knives and chopsticks hanging from their waists. According to them, the new road is a great engineering achievement, winding through mountains over 7,000 feet high, but it still needs several months of repair before it can be fully used. The ambassador's party was accompanied by a guard of honor of Chinese soldiers along the way, and each province dispatched a truckload of soldiers to escort them along the way to the provincial border. Those who went to welcome them when they arrived in Chongqing included American Ambassador Counselor Baker, representatives from the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and other representatives of the American community. A large number of journalists also came to the scene. Everyone had been waiting at Taipingmen on the north bank of the Yangtze River since noon, because the Chinese authorities had received a telegram from the ambassador stating that he would arrive in Chongqing at 1:00 PM, but the telegram to the embassy after the ambassador left Kunming stated that he would arrive at noon. According to reports, the ambassador's party stayed overnight in Yongchuan last night. (29th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

The American ambassador was covered in dust, but he was healthier than usual. When talking to the greeters, he smiled and repeatedly said that the trip was excellent. According to reports, this is the first time since the war of resistance that the ambassadors of the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union have all been in Chongqing at the same time.

<p>Yokohama – Nine of the twenty-one Germans seized by the British from the Asama Maru arrived here this morning at 7:00 AM on the British auxiliary cruiser HMS Canberra (10,985 tons) and have been handed over to the Japanese authorities. Among the Japanese officials was a section chief from the European Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, accompanied by British Naval Attaché Colonel Dufnell, who took a ferry to the British warship. At around 8:00 AM, they took over the nine Germans handed over by the British. At 10:10 AM, they disembarked at the main wharf in Yokohama. The Germans were then sent to the Immigration Office to check their passports. About fifty Japanese news reporters and photographers, the German Consul-General in Yokohama, and several German reporters gathered at the wharf. About 300 Japanese people also gathered outside the gate of the Immigration Office. However, the Germans were not allowed to speak to the news reporters. According to a representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, all procedures were carried out very smoothly, and the courtesy and sincerity of the British officers were commendable. The Germans were handed over to the German Consul-General at 12:30 PM and were reportedly staying at a hotel for the time being. The British warship HMS Canberra left Yokohama at 10:30 AM this morning. It is noteworthy that the handover of the Germans was handled by the captain of the British warship and the representative of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Japanese Navy did not participate, because it is believed that this case was negotiated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

<p>Hong Kong – A communiqué issued here today stated that the British warship HMS Canberra arrived outside Yokohama Port this morning and landed nine Germans taken off the Asama Maru.

<h3 id="e15">The Japanese Side Begins to Monopolize Materials in the Occupied Areas of Central China. Materials Related to Military Use are Banned from Export. <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>Osaka – The Osaka Municipal Bureau of Industry has learned that the Japanese authorities in Central China have begun to restrict or absolutely prohibit the transportation of certain materials produced in the occupied areas to Shanghai or non-occupied areas, as these materials are crucial for military purposes. This policy aims to obtain a sufficient supply of important materials needed by Japan from China. The banned items include various iron materials, bronze, brass, and tinware, coal, ramie, raw cotton, leather, vegetable oil, pig bristles, and tea. In addition to establishing companies to purchase these products and transport them to Japan, the Japanese authorities are also giving special treatment to several important Japanese companies to purchase these products. Companies such as the Japan Iron Company, the Central China Mining Company, the Central South Coal Mining Company, the Central China Raw Cotton Federation, the Central China Export Cotton Weaving Company, and the Central China Export Merchants Federation all enjoy this special privilege. According to the Japan Times, although these companies enjoy special privileges, they will also suffer serious setbacks if the Yangtze River is opened for general traffic, as Chinese and third-country industries and businesses in the Yangtze River basin enjoy the advantages of huge capital, long history, and a solid foothold. Therefore, Japanese companies should merge into powerful special groups, supplied by the Japanese government with huge capital, to control the various industrial and commercial institutions in the Japanese-occupied areas of China and enable them to cope with competition. In order to monopolize exports from Central China, the Japanese plan to establish a Japanese Ramie Company and a financial institution composed of major Japanese banks, with a loan of 25 million Japanese yen to the Central China Promotion Company. At the same time, the East Asia Shipping Company, as one of the Japanese "national policy" companies subsidized by the government, has a capital of 75 million Japanese yen and was established in August of last year by the Japanese Ministry of Communications and ten Japanese shipping companies to operate between China and Japan, along the coast, and on China's inland rivers. It is now heard that business is very good and the future is promising. (29th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>Washington - A bill to increase the capital of the Federal Export-Import Bank by $100 million to provide credit loans to China and Finland was recently passed by the Senate. The House of Representatives has now approved it by a majority of 168 votes to 51. However, there are two points of discrepancy with the original bill passed by the Senate, which need to be adjusted before it can be submitted to President Roosevelt for approval and enactment into law. In addition, during the House's discussion of this bill today, a motion was proposed by a member to lend $20 million to Finland without restrictions on its use (referring to allowing its use for purchasing military supplies). This was ultimately rejected by the House by a vote of 106 to 49. (Havas dispatch, 28th)</p>

<p>Washington - Secretary of State Hull recently issued a statement to newspaper reporters, stating that regarding the US government's separate talks with neutral countries, the statement he recently issued has been communicated to various countries through diplomatic channels and was not limited to neutral countries. The main point of this statement is to advocate for disarmament and greater trade freedom as a basis for improving the world situation. As for the talks conducted by the US government, they are merely a broad-ranging investigative effort and have no connection with the current war in Europe, and should not be seen as an attempt at mediation. According to his personal impression, all neutral governments that have had contact with the US government have responded favorably to this investigation. However, he cannot disclose at this time whether any of these governments have made suggestions. In short, what the US government seeks is that after the end of the war, the world's economic life will no longer be controlled by self-sufficiency or other forms of autarky, so that suggestions can be made on a solid and sound basis. Therefore, all forces working for peace and stability should be organized so that they can enter a period of peaceful reconstruction once the state of war ends. If this can be achieved, economic self-sufficiency and totalitarianism will no longer be in the position they were in after the last war. (Havas dispatch, 28th)</p>

<p>Soleure, Switzerland - US Undersecretary of State Welles arrived here last night, and a large crowd gathered at the station to cheer him. After arriving, Welles took a car directly to his hotel to rest before traveling to Berlin after his visit to Rome. It seems there is no issue of Welles holding special talks in Switzerland. Welles will depart for Berlin this afternoon on a sleeper car specially prepared by the German government. It is expected that after spending two or three days in Germany, Welles will return to Paris and London via Switzerland, and finally return to Rome, where he will take a ship from Naples back to New York. (Reuters dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>Berlin - Here, some in political circles have lost hope that US Undersecretary of State Welles' tour of European capitals might yield some kind of peace mediation plan. This is because German newspapers have published articles authorized by the authorities, denying British reports that Chancellor Hitler has considered submitting a peace proposal to the US special envoy. German newspapers are all framing the destruction of the British Empire as Germany's war aim. The "Political Newspaper" claims that Germany can envision peace, harmony, and friendship among nations, but the tyrant must be expelled from all parts of the world. The disappearance of the tyrant is a prerequisite for freedom of the seas and for correcting centuries of injustice. This terror must first be shattered so that constructive nations can cooperate harmoniously. One newspaper denounced the peace proposal as "lying, brazen, arrogant, and unconscious deception, providing unlimited entertainment for every German." Another newspaper claimed that Germany's goal is war, war until victory, war until the destruction of the London financiers who constantly threaten the world with new wars. The leader and the German people hope that the tyranny and oppression of other peoples by Britain can end. (United Press dispatch, 29th)</p>

<p>Tokyo - During today's session of the House of Representatives, someone asked Foreign Minister Arita whether the Ministry of Foreign Affairs would yield to the will of the United States regarding the current state of no treaty between the US and Japan. Arita replied that even if the United States completely opposes the construction of a new order in East Asia, does not understand Japan's objectives in China, or even insists that Japan should accept its views on the matter, Japan will not be afraid. But the current situation has not yet reached this point. Arita reiterated that he has no intention of adopting a perfunctory policy to negotiate a temporary agreement on a US-Japan treaty on the condition of reopening the Yangtze River. From the standpoint of an autonomous Japan, this or any other outstanding issue will be resolved properly. He cannot be sure of the US government's thinking, but if its true intention is to reject Japan's objectives and the war, and unless Japan withdraws its objectives, there will be nothing to adjust in US-Japan relations, then Japan will express a firm attitude towards the policy being implemented.

Next, the bill to amend the Employment Security Act was discussed. After Minister Yoshida explained the reasons for the proposal, Mr. Inoue Ryoji (Social Mass Party) questioned the government's policy on wage issues and women's labor issues. Prime Minister Yonai responded. It was decided to refer the bill to improve the national treasury's burden on municipal compulsory education expenses to a committee. It was decided to refer the bill to issue public bonds for the purchase of railways belonging to the Sakhalin Railway Company and eight other bills to the committee without questioning. It was decided to submit the bill to amend Law No. 45 of the 9th year of Showa (regarding trade regulation and trade protection (after being referred to the Upper House)) for discussion. After Mr. Kimura, Parliamentary Undersecretary of the Ministry of Finance, explained the reasons for the proposal, Mr. Seko Koichi (Seiyu KuGen faction) questioned whether the government intends to establish a Ministry of Trade. Minister of Commerce and Industry Fujiwara replied that the current cabinet is carefully studying this issue. Mr. Tahara Haruketsu (Social Mass Party) also questioned the issue of the Ministry of Trade, and then the bill was referred to the Deficit Public Bond Committee. Next, the Farrier Act and another bill were referred to committees. The session adjourned at 3:39 PM. (Domei dispatch, 29th)</p>

<p>London - Diplomatic circles here have recently received news that the Turkish government is taking precautionary measures in all areas and obtaining various forms of assistance from Britain and France. In addition, the British and French "Eastern Army" has already been formed. From Turkey's Edirne to Egypt and from the Mediterranean coast to Afghanistan, defenses are extremely strong. Whether Germany or the Soviet Union attempts aggression, they will be unable to achieve their goals. At this moment, the training and equipment of the Turkish army is becoming increasingly advanced. In addition to the fact that the Bosphorus Strait area has already been actively equipped with air defense equipment and residents have prepared to evacuate, measures have also been taken to defend against the Soviet Union in the direction of Artvin. The general public in Turkey is increasingly suspicious of the Soviet Union, believing that Russian imperialism, which has long threatened Turkey's Dardanelles and Bosphorus Straits as its traditional policy, has now been revived. Because of these things, if relations between Britain and France and the Soviet Union become increasingly tense to the point of rupture, then Turkey will surely be a strong arm of Britain and France. In addition, Britain and France are providing assistance to the weaker resisting forces in the Near East in order to contain the Soviet Union and prevent it from advancing southward, that is, to contain the Soviet Union's expansion of power toward India. Countries such as Iran will receive loans of £5 million to £6 million from the United States, and Afghanistan is also reorganizing its defenses in preparation for the Soviet Union.

<p>Stockholm, Sweden - Finnish and Soviet forces fought fiercely all day yesterday, contesting Vyborg. Finnish artillery shelled Soviet troops around Vyborg Bay, and newly arrived foreign aircraft heavily bombed Soviet lines, dropping bombs on Soviet tanks, artillery, and soldiers on the ice, causing them to sink into the water. Experts in Helsinki believe that Finnish forces will be able to continue to hold Vyborg because it is easier to defend. Last night, the temperature rose, and people hoped that the weather would turn bad and hinder the Soviet advance. (Reuters dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>Helsinki - According to sources here, as of February 26, the Soviet army had lost a total of 1,288 tanks. The intensity of the artillery fire at Vyborg is now unprecedented since the start of the war. (Reuters dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>Moscow - According to a communiqué from the headquarters of the Leningrad Military District, Soviet forces continued to make progress in the Karelian sector yesterday. The enemy repeatedly attempted counterattacks to stop the Soviet advance, but were repelled and suffered heavy casualties. They are now continuing to retreat. Soviet troops occupied enemy fortresses on the north bank of the Salmenkaitajoki River, and also occupied the villages of Riitesaari (west bank of Lake Viiksinselkä), Markkila, Hamanijoenmi, and Heikkila (north of Lake Kalajärvi). Hanjoki, 6 kilometers south of Vyborg, and Kamara, 4 kilometers southwest of Yalski Station, were also occupied by Soviet troops. According to unverified statistics, Soviet forces captured a total of forty-two enemy fortresses yesterday. There were no major developments in other sectors. The Soviet Air Force only conducted reconnaissance flights due to bad weather. (TASS dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>Helsinki - The Finnish General Headquarters issued an official report yesterday stating that Finnish forces in Karelia held their ground and inflicted heavy casualties on the Soviet army. Artillery battles were extremely fierce. An enemy attack northeast of Lake Ladoga was repelled, and several Soviet units were annihilated. The Finnish Air Force was unusually active yesterday, flying to enemy positions to reconnoiter and bomb several military targets. The Soviet Air Force concentrated on the Karelian Isthmus and northeast of Lake Ladoga, and bombed Petsamo, but the damage was minimal. (Haitong dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>London - Sir Dukie, the British Information Minister at the British Embassy in Sweden, recently returned here from the Finnish war zone. According to him today, the Soviet Union has suffered 500,000 casualties in the three months of the war against Finland. 100,000 have died on the Eastern Mannerheim Line alone. As for the tanks captured and destroyed by Finland, the total is between 1,100 and 1,500. 500 aircraft have been shot down by the Finnish side. But although the Soviet Union's losses are heavy, it still has a strong combat capability, because the Soviet Union can easily mobilize an army of 10 million to 15 million. Finally, he hoped that Britain could increase its assistance to Finland with arms and ammunition. (United Press dispatch, 29th)</p>

<p>London - Three hundred Hungarians have already passed through London on their way to Finland to assist in the war. Only an advance unit of British volunteers has departed for Finland today, while the main force of several hundred will depart later. It is reported that thousands have applied to volunteer, including some women and older people. Hundreds have been selected by the Finnish International Volunteer Army in Finland to supply clothing, equipment, and transportation to and from Finland, as well as living expenses in Finland. The Finnish government is responsible for the cost of raising foreign troops in Finland. It is estimated that the cost borne by the Finnish office is £200 per person. The office is now eager to raise more funds to cope with the situation. British volunteers are given a daily allowance of two shillings, those injured are entitled to allowances, and the families of those who die are entitled to compensation. (Reuters dispatch, 29th)</p>

<p>Oslo - According to Norwegian Foreign Minister Goode, speaking to a United Press reporter today, Norway's attitude toward the Soviet-Finnish war is exactly the same as Sweden's, that is, non-intervention. Norway's decision is based on the same belief expressed by the King of Sweden, namely, the deep conviction that intervention in the Soviet-Finnish war will expose the entire Scandinavia to great danger and involve the Scandinavian countries in the vortex of the European war. As for the dispatch of volunteers and the raising of donations, these are nothing more than due to humanitarian considerations and are also an expression of sympathy for Finland. He also said that Norway and Sweden are taking a strict neutral stance. When asked by a reporter whether the Soviet Union might exert pressure on Norway after conquering Finland, the Norwegian Foreign Minister declined to comment, only saying, "I can clearly state that, from a historical point of view, the Soviet Union will not make any demands on Norway." (United Press dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>Oslo - At today's meeting of the House of Representatives, Conservative Party leader Hambro first made a speech, strongly emphasizing Norway's determination to maintain neutrality. Foreign Minister Goode then spoke, saying in brief, "Since the outbreak of the European war, Norwegian ships have often been sunk by warships of belligerent countries. The nationality of these warships is sometimes difficult to ascertain. There have also been those that have sunk after hitting mines, and it is not known which country laid these mines. Therefore, if our government wants to lodge a protest, it must do so to both belligerent parties at the same time." (Havas dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>London - The Scandinavian Peninsula countries originally stipulated that no more than 300 volunteers per day could transit through their countries to Finland. According to well-informed sources here, the British government is negotiating with these countries to increase this quota. In addition, it is heard that the Finnish government does not welcome Polish volunteers, believing that their joining the Finnish army will make Germany feel dissatisfied. But as a matter of fact, since Polish territory has been invaded by the Soviet Union, Poles have no legal reason to maintain neutrality in the Finnish-Soviet war. Therefore, it is very appropriate to send a Polish volunteer division to Finland to assist in the war. (Havas dispatch, 29th)</p>

<p>London - British aircraft have repeatedly flown to Germany for reconnaissance recently without encountering interception. The Daily Express recently published the opinions of aviation experts, suggesting three reasons as follows: (1) Certain areas of Germany have been designated as strategic areas, equipped with large-caliber heavy artillery and searchlights. The German military authorities want to keep these air defense mechanisms secret, so they are reserved for use during a large-scale air raid by British bombers in the future, but they are not worth using against reconnaissance planes at present. (2) The use of anti-aircraft artillery would interfere with the activities of factories in industrial areas, so it will only be used to counter the enemy when these areas are bombed. (3) The German authorities do not want to cause panic among the people. (Havas dispatch, 29th)</p>

<p>Swiss Capital: A Havas correspondent, recently arriving from the former Austrian border, reports that Germany is constructing fortifications in the Dolomites mountain range at the junction of the former Austrian provinces of Carinthia, Styria, and Salzburg. The workforce consists of 70,000 people, primarily Polish prisoners and German military engineers. Furthermore, reports from Judenburg indicate that underground airfields are being built near the cities of Fohnsdorf and Mautern, with large quantities of munitions and aircraft being continuously transported to the Italian border. Residents in these areas have received official notices to prepare for evacuation if necessary, causing great anxiety, as these military preparations are seen as defensive measures against potential Italian attacks.

<p>London: Dominions Secretary Eden, speaking in Liverpool today, stated that Hitlerism and the international gang of thugs who support it have now been completely defeated and captured. They can no longer ensure their safety, and there is no hope for the future. Any armistice, any superficial mediation that you may encounter, will, if we disregard the significant danger, only lead to even greater danger in a few months or years, and then it will be too late to regret. If we engage in mediation to resolve disputes with those whose only belief is barbarous force and whose only means is trampling, we will inevitably regress into the Dark Ages. Rest and recuperation this autumn and winter would indeed greatly benefit Britain, allowing us to prepare. However, if we forget the essential lesson that only the victory in the final act of war constitutes the enemy's defeat, then our preparations will not only fail to comfort us but will even lead to danger. These past few months have allowed us time to forge weapons, and once these weapons are ready, they will be used to effectively eliminate the enemy. (Reuters, 29th)</p>

<p>London: Prime Minister Chamberlain addressed chairmen of War Agricultural Executive Committees from various British districts yesterday, urging them to vigorously promote rural production. He said that the nation is now being transformed into a large armaments factory, and therefore the shipping industry bears a heavy responsibility. Although shipping losses are significant, they are insignificant compared to the overall volume of shipping. Adopting plans to enhance our security is essential, but these plans are not economically sound in themselves. Besides the amount of shipping at our disposal, we also face a factor limiting imports, which is our foreign exchange strength. To overcome this difficulty, we must increase domestic food production. Some say the government's target of two million acres is too low, but we believe that two million acres is the highest figure attainable. We face some difficulties due to unfavorable weather, but if everyone works hard, we should still be able to reach this target. The War Cabinet will support farmers' efforts to increase production. He has asked the Lord Privy Seal to personally participate in this campaign. He has heard that some farmers are currently hesitant to plant more turnips for fear that there will not be enough labor to harvest them. He can provide them with a firm guarantee that the government will take any necessary steps to ensure that the harvested agricultural products will be harvested. As for the notion that farmers' treatment is inferior to that of factory workers, he wishes to firmly deny it. However, the funds available for subsidies are limited, and the evils of prices and wages chasing each other are undesirable. The government has now decided on the future status of agriculture after the war. If the current government is still in power after the war, it will never allow the tragedy of agricultural collapse after the last war to be repeated in the future. (Reuters, 29th)</p>

Italy's coal supply currently comes mostly from Germany, and this issue is a major obstacle in the negotiations. Italy is willing to exchange agricultural products for British coal, but Britain prefers Italian heavy industrial products. Britain has also expressed its intention to prohibit the export of German coal currently transported to Italy by sea, which may exacerbate the difficulties between the two countries. It is noted that the Allied Powers have traditionally granted preferential treatment to Italy during the blockade against Germany. Italian news reports claim that if Britain purchases heavy industrial goods, Italian industry will soon be dominated by Britain. (Reuters, 29th)</p>

<p>London: According to news from here today, Britain recently discovered an espionage case. The arrested individual is a 25-year-old German national named Sülf. Reportedly, Sülf resided in the home of a high-ranking official in the Ministry of Supply, from where he had a clear view of the Royal Air Force station in Abingdon. It was discovered that Sülf was secretly photographing damaged British aircraft at the airbase when he was spotted by a four-year-old Italian girl. This led to his arrest by the British authorities. Under interrogation, it was learned that Sülf had served in the cavalry under the Nazi regime and had also worked in a German aircraft factory. He had also studied at Oxford University in England. In 1939, he returned to Germany once and returned to England before the outbreak of the European war. The Abingdon local court has sentenced Sülf to one month in prison. However, various public groups have expressed dissatisfaction with this sentence, considering it too lenient, and have telegraphed members of Parliament, urging them to tighten restrictions on the activities of enemy aliens. There are currently 70,000 German nationals in Britain. It is said that while not all of these German nationals are spies, they all have relatives in Germany, so there is concern that if they are subjected to pressure, they will fulfill their espionage responsibilities for Germany.

He also touched on the issue of Japanese aircraft bombing the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, stating that the Japanese government had promised France to compensate for the damages. The Foreign Affairs Committee issued a communique afterward stating, "Prime Minister Daladier first reported on the situation on the Western Front, commenting on the various incidents caused by Germany's repeated threats to Belgium and the Netherlands. He also reviewed the various issues arising from the war between Finland and the Soviet Union, stating that Britain and France have supplied Finland with a large amount of military supplies. It is true that the Red Army has gained some victories in the Karelian Isthmus of Finland due to the disparity in strength between the Finnish and Soviet forces, but France should continue to provide assistance to Finland. Furthermore, the recent meeting of the Balkan Entente in the Yugoslav capital has yielded good results. As a result of Turkey's many diplomatic activities, the situation in the Balkan Peninsula has improved, and the relations between Romania and Bulgaria have also improved. Regarding the bombing of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway by Japanese aircraft, the Japanese government has promised to compensate for the damages. As for the German situation, it may be premature to say that the country is on the verge of collapse, but the domestic difficulties are indeed numerous. Although the country's propaganda organs are trying to cover it up, they often achieve the opposite effect. Finally, Prime Minister Daladier, with great confidence, listed the reasons for France's inevitable victory, which was greeted with applause from all the deputies. After the Prime Minister finished speaking, several deputies raised questions on various issues, especially the mission of US Undersecretary of State Welles to Europe, France's interests in the Far East, and the negotiations conducted by Britain, France, and the Soviet Union in the spring of last year. The Prime Minister answered each question individually. The chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Mistralet, then thanked the Prime Minister on behalf of the committee for his objective and faithful report." (Havas, 28th)</p>

<p>(Chengdu, 28th) Dr. Bi Qi, an American who founded West China University and was commended by the National Government on the 26th, came to China in his youth to devote himself to education. He returned to his country in 23 years and did not intend to come to China again. Recently, due to the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War and the destruction of culture by the Japanese army, he came to Sichuan by roundabout route at the age of twilight, and brought a large number of materials to enrich the school's equipment. It is admirable to have a beginning and an end. Now that Dr. Bi is 73 years old, he has decided to leave China in mid-March and return to the United States to enjoy his old age.

<p>Those Who Cannot Return to Their Original Agencies Will Be Given Jobs at Discretion</p>
<p>(Chengdu Airmail) The Executive Yuan forwarded the instructions of the National Government, according to the report of the Ministry of Personnel, the Examination Yuan, and the Ministry of Personnel, the people who passed the higher and ordinary examinations of the central and local governments in the past were evacuated by various agencies during the national period, or were unemployed due to the fall of the inland areas. The Ministry had previously drafted four relief measures and submitted them to the Ministry of Finance, which were forwarded to the National Government for approval and implementation. Article 3 of the original measures stipulates that if the original service agency has been lost in the occupied area, or the person is scattered in various places, and cannot return to the original agency for work due to traffic congestion, the Ministry will consider each member's wishes and submit a request to reassign him to the agency in the place where he is located or nearby, and give him a job at its discretion. In recent years, there have been quite a few people who have come to Sichuan and cannot return to their original agencies for work for a while. It seems that it is not enough to promote relief because the surrounding provinces can hardly accommodate as much as possible. Now, according to the Central Agency, it can also be assigned at its discretion, so as to adjust the situation, and it is also planned to supplement the regulations for filling in the application form and photos.

<p>Implement Special Account Management to Ensure Independence</p>
<p>(Chengdu Airmail) After the implementation of the new county system in Sichuan Province, the local education funds should be intensified and consolidated, and its independence should be ensured. The following is a record of the various items stipulated in the original order: The local education funds of each county should be consolidated and its independence should be ensured. The central government and the provincial government have repeatedly stipulated specific measures and notified them to be followed. At the time when the new county system is being implemented at the beginning of the 29th year, all local education facilities will be more complicated than before, and the scope of the business will be wider. The expenditure of funds will also increase. If we do not find ways to increase revenue and consolidate the original production, on the one hand, we will implement special account management to ensure independence and prevent the past abuses of misappropriation and erosion, concealment and embezzlement, and delayed payment, then not only the implementation of the new county system will be difficult to implement, but also the original education business will be deeply affected. Now, according to the points of ensuring education funds in the repeated orders, and after investigating the implementation of the new county system, the following matters should be noted by each county at the end of the 29th year, which were decided by the 357th Committee Meeting of the Provincial Government:</p>
<p>1. When each county prepares the budget for the 29th year, the total amount of education and cultural expenses should not be less than the total amount originally listed in the 28th year, and should be increased in accordance with the following principles: (A) When the total expenses of the county increase, the education and cultural expenses should increase proportionally. (B) When the income of the originally designated education funds and properties increases due to consolidation, the increased portion should still be fully allocated to education and cultural expenses. (C) The balance of education funds from the previous year should be fully used for expanding education business in the current year and should not be mixed into other expenses and arbitrarily allocated for purposes. (D) In addition to the first three items, the funds required to increase the salaries of primary school teachers may also be raised separately in accordance with the provisions of Item 2, and should not affect the original or new education business funds. 2. If the original funds are insufficient due to the promotion of education business in each county, they should actively raise funds in accordance with the provisions of Article 5 of the first step implementation measures for consolidating education funds in each county decided by the 342nd Committee Meeting of the Provincial Government. 3. They should be consolidated and handled by the Financial Consolidation Committee of Shaanxi County in accordance with the consolidation measures stipulated by the Provincial Government. 4. Each county must implement special account management for education funds. Each county magistrate should submit a report on the handling of this article to the Provincial Government for record by the end of January. 5. The education funds of each county should be spent by the responsible section of the county government in accordance with the approved budget, and the monthly allocation should be submitted to the county magistrate for approval and the payment order should be filled out before the 15th of each month to notify the disbursement agency to issue the funds. If the income is insufficient, the county government should find ways to raise funds and should not delay payment. 6. Each county should select local fair gentry and education representatives to openly handle the sale of school grains, and should fairly negotiate prices at the current market value. Personnel from the Finance Committee and personnel related to education should not purchase them to prevent abuses. In addition to the separate orders, the combined orders are for compliance and conscientious handling. This order.</p>

<h3 id="e67">Labor Unrest Intensifies, Public Buses Stop Running Yesterday, Italian Soldiers Fire Tear Gas, Many Injured, Company Strictly Refuses Demands <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>More than 2,000 coppersmiths, drivers, and ticket sellers of the British-owned China General Omnibus Company demanded pre-war treatment. They went on strike yesterday morning, causing all public buses to stop running completely. The striking workers gathered in front of the factory gate to demand a reply from the manager. The Italian garrison dispatched Italian soldiers to the post for strict guard. The company did not accept the workers' demands after consideration. The Industrial Section of the Municipal Council tried to mediate. The details are recorded as follows.</p>
<p>Strike Implemented Due to Unmet Demands</p>
<p>The company's coppersmiths first made a request to the company the night before to restore pre-war (before August 13) treatment, which was not approved by the authorities. The night shift coppersmiths first went on strike, and the day shift coppersmiths also stayed in the factory and did not leave all night. As for the drivers and ticket sellers, when they went to work in the factory yesterday morning, they continued the coppersmiths' demands and went on strike together. All the striking workers gathered at the company's factory gate square at 1171 Kang Nao Tu Road, and pushed six worker representatives to stand in the snow to demand a firm reply from the company.</p>
<p>All Buses on All Routes Stopped</p>
<p>All public buses on all routes were stopped from leaving the factory yesterday morning, resulting in a complete temporary suspension of service, including: Route 1 from Zhaofeng Park to Beijing Road Bund, Route 2 from Anhe Temple Road to Sichuan Road Bridge, Route 5 from Sanmaoge Bridge to Bazilu, Route 7 from Nanyang University to Caojiadu, Route 9 from Zhaofeng Park to Beijing Road Bund, Route 10 from Caojiadu to the Bund, Route 12 from Xiafei Road to Municipal Ferry Bund, Route 14 from Daxi Road and Dunxin Road to Nanjing Road Bund, Route 15 from Fuxu Road Tongfu Road to the Bund, Route 17 from Jing'an Temple to Robert Sun Road Intersection.</p>
<p>Italian Soldiers and Detectives Went to Guard</p>
<p>Kang Nao Tu Road is an Italian military defense zone. After receiving the report, Italian soldiers were dispatched to the front of the public bus company to guard closely. At the same time, the local police station also sent a large number of Chinese and Western detectives to maintain order and persuade the striking workers gathered at the company's gate to leave. As for the striking workers, in this extraordinary period, they strictly maintained order and had no outrageous actions. It is said that Italian soldiers have been stationed at the factory gate to prohibit anyone from entering or leaving (company employees are not subject to this rule).</p>
<p>Demands to Restore Pre-War Treatment</p>
<p>According to the striking workers yesterday, after the August 13 Shanghai War broke out, the company reduced workers' treatment from January 1938 due to sluggish business. Until June of last year, workers asked the company authorities to improve treatment due to soaring prices and difficult living conditions. The company agreed to add a 10% allowance. Until December of last year, due to the continued surge in prices, the workers made a second request. The company only agreed to issue a meal allowance of 15 cents per person per day, which was implemented in January of this year, but at this time, this amount was really of no help, so there was this third request to improve treatment. The workers decided that the requirements were the original methods before August 13, hoping that the authorities could understand the difficulties and accept them.</p>
<p>The Company Did Not Agree</p>
<p>The company manager met with the heads of the vehicle and machine departments in the company at 10:00 AM yesterday to discuss the terms of the workers' demands. He believed that the points of the workers' request for a salary increase could not be accepted, so he rejected the workers' demands yesterday.</p>
<p>Italian Soldiers Interfere and Workers are Injured</p>
<p>As a result, the two sides were deadlocked. Until about 2:00 PM yesterday, a satisfactory solution had not yet been reached. Unexpectedly, Italian soldiers saw that more and more workers were gathering, so they fired tear gas. The workers fled, and the order was disrupted. The strike wave has worsened. There were a total of thirteen people injured on the spot. Cao Jisheng, 21 years old, Li Zhiming, 12 years old, Yin Decheng, 29 years old, Yan Chenghua, 16 years old, Zhu Yifu, 21 years old, Zhou Zhengquan, 31 years old, Liu Jin, 11 years old, Zhang Shifu, 28 years old, Xiao Maozhang, 23 years old, He Changfa, 18 years old, Cao Youwang, 14 years old, Bai Bing, 23 years old, and Li Jimei, 26 years old, were all drivers and ticket sellers. The police summoned ambulances to the scene and sent them to the Hai Yu Road Red Cross Hospital and the Second Branch of Tongren Hospital at the end of Yu Yuan Road for treatment.</p>
<p>All Workers in the Factory Were Expelled</p>
<p>After the incident, all workers in the factory were expelled by Italian soldiers, and martial law was declared around the factory site. The situation was very tense. The relevant police station also sent a large number of detectives to suppress the situation. It is reported that the company has decided to open Routes 1 and 9 this morning and hire foreign drivers.</p>

<p>The Soybean Rice Company Association issued a notice yesterday regarding the withholding of donation fees for rice trading, saying, "For the purpose of announcement, the association convened a joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees on the 26th of this month, and the Mountain City Market Management Committee sent personnel to attend to discuss the case of withholding various donation fees for foreign rice trading. It was decided at the time that, in this extraordinary period, starting from March 1st of this year, for foreign rice trading, 6 cents of temporary miscellaneous fees will be deducted per bag based on a unit of 160 market catties, including 1 cent per bag for refugee donations, and various association fees. Before March 1st, the old rules will still apply, and no deductions will be made." The record is on file and should be recorded and announced to let everyone know.</p>
<p>Market New Rules for Purchasing Completed Tickets</p>
<p>Also, after the rice industry market strictly enforced the association rules and restricted illegal transactions, new methods for purchasing completed tickets have now been formulated, which will be implemented starting today. (1) All members of the Soybean Rice Company Association must purchase and receive completed entry and exit tickets. (2) Dealers and various vendors only need to purchase and receive completed exit tickets. (Purchase procedures require official seals and purchase tickets. If there are no official tickets, they cannot be purchased.) The new rice shops that were approved for trading by the market this month include Zhenfengtai, Wanli, Xintongheng, Hengfengtai, Hongchang, Defu, Renhe, Suicheng, Huthaichang, Yuanchang, Xieji, Zhengxingxie, Dachang, etc., totaling thirteen companies.</p>
<p>Group Rice Purchases Arrive One After Another</p>
<p>After the Shanghai People's Food Regulation Association organized group rice purchases,</p>
<p>It has accepted commissions from various groups, companies, factories, and firms, and has ordered sixteen batches of No. 2 rice from Saigon, totaling approximately 50,000 bags (1 stone and 2.5 dou per bag). The second batch of 10,000 bags has been loaded and shipped to Shanghai from West Saigon. The association sent personnel to negotiate loans with the bank and then notified the purchasers. According to reports, the Jardine Matheson Company's Yongsheng wheel brought 16,212 bags of foreign rice from Huagang, which was imported on the evening of the 28th and docked at the Roosevelt Wharf in the French Concession. Unloading began yesterday.</p>
<p>Donating Steamed Buns, Sharing Hunger and Thirst</p>
<p>The bakeries affiliated with the Biscuit, Candy, Canned Food and Bread Industry Association were previously introduced by Secretary Yan of the Municipal Senior Association and approved by the Municipal Council to supply 3,000 bags of low-priced flour per factory per day, which can be temporarily stabilized. Now, in addition to being grateful, each factory is willing to make 2,000 steamed buns, totaling 40,000 steamed buns, to donate to refugees to express their desire to share hunger and thirst. In addition to sending 4,000 to the Christian Puyi Handicraft Society and the Pushi Road Orphanage, the remaining 36,000 have been distributed to refugee relief agencies in accordance with the instructions of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, as well as biscuit foods and a portion of the candy factories. The flour normally required is now difficult to purchase, and the lives of nearly 10,000 employees have been affected. They have specially opened their required quantity list, a total of 34 factories, requiring 703.5 bags of flour per day, and are willing to purchase at market prices to maintain their livelihood. They have requested relief from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and it is reported that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has transferred the request to the Flour Mill Association.</p>

<p>In order to actively promote the low-price sale of coal briquettes, the Shanghai Low-Price Coal Briquette Committee held its first committee meeting at 4:00 PM yesterday at Room 304, 3rd Floor, Hong Kong Road Banking Association. Chairman Xu Jilu decided: (1) to pass the twelve articles of the coal briquette low-price sale method; (2) the low-price sale will start on March 1st; (3) the low-price locations will total 26, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce will send a letter to the two concessions authorities to send police to take care of and protect them.</p>
<p>Each Factory Distributes the Low-Price Quantity</p>
<p>A reporter from the New Sound News learned from the Shanghai Coal Briquette Industry Association yesterday that the association has already stipulated the quantity of coal briquettes sold at a low price by each factory: (A) Daily Sales Quantity: (1) Yi Taixing 480 loads, (2) Nanyang 200 loads, (3) Guohua 70 loads, (4) Dongfang 70 loads, (5) Jinghua 60 loads, (6) Guanghua 40 loads, (7) Huacheng Cuiji 20 loads, (8) Yuedong 20 loads, (9) Yuanhua 10 loads, (10) Heji 5 loads, (11) Nanfang Changji 10 loads, (12) Hu Licheng 5 loads, (13) Yanyan 5 loads, (14) Beiyang 5 loads, totaling 1,000 loads sold per day. (B) Total Recognized Quantity: (1) Yi Taixing 9,600 loads, (2) Nanyang 4,000 loads, (3) Guohua 1,400 loads, (4) Dongfang 1,400 loads, (5) Jinghua 1,200 loads, (6) Guanghua 800 loads, (7) Huacheng Cuiji 400 loads, (8) Yuedong 400 loads, (9) Yuanhua 200 loads, (10) Heji 100 loads, (11) Nanfang Changji 200 loads, (12) Hu Licheng 100 loads, (13) Yanyan 100 loads, (14) Beiyang 100 loads, totaling 20,000 loads recognized and distributed by each factory.</p>
<p>Jointly Issued Notice to Clear Stacked Goods</p>
<p>Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Shanghai Coal Industry Association, Shanghai Machine-Made Coal Briquette Industry Association, and Shanghai Firewood and Charcoal Industry Association jointly issued a notice yesterday, saying, "The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Machine-Made Coal Briquette Industry Association previously jointly issued a notice to stabilize the price of coal briquettes, stipulating that the wholesale price of coal briquettes should be 110 yuan per metric ton, and the door-to-door price should be 5 yuan and 8 jiao per hundred market catties, with an additional 2 jiao for delivery. The coal briquette stack tickets are limited to be cleared before February 29th. Because most of the coal briquette stack tickets have been recovered as scheduled, and a portion of the stack tickets has not been cleared due to the factory's simultaneous handling of door-to-door sales or the difficulty of transporting goods, the groups jointly decided on February 28th that all stack tickets that have not yet been shipped will be extended for 15 days starting from March 1st and must be cleared before March 15th. No new stack tickets will be issued, and the Coal Briquette Industry Association has resolved to implement this. All factories should strictly comply. Also, the price of coal briquettes will still be sold at the previously set amount. All Gu Coal Briquette Factories and coal, firewood, and charcoal stores in the city should abide by this and not exceed it. This is what we hope. Special announcement." It is reported that the stack rent will only be charged until February 29th during the extended delivery period for stack tickets, and rent will be waived from March 1st.</p>
<p>Appeal of Small Coal Briquette Factories</p>
<p>The soaring price of coal briquettes this time has caused the common people to face the danger of running out of food, but the most deeply affected and neglected are our ten or so small coal briquette factories. Because small coal briquette factories are limited by capital and cannot transport directly from the mine, they are everywhere subject to the control of others. Even this time, large capitalists stirred up trouble and raised the price of coal briquettes and coal chips by thirty-three days, claiming that the water freight had risen to 28 shillings. In fact, coal with 28 shillings of water freight has not yet been loaded to Shanghai. The six major coal merchants have piles of coal chips like mountains, totaling no less than 30,000 tons, all of which were imported at cheap water freight. Now they are either hoarding coal chips and not selling them, or raising the price to more than 110 yuan per ton, or claiming that "self-transportation and self-production are not enough to distribute to small factories" (see the letter from the association to the three companies). The market has become tense, and they are also monopolizing raw materials, so that small factories cannot work hard even if they want to supply the market. Recently, Tongcheng Company automatically allocated 200 tons of coal chips and distributed them to various small factories at a flat price of 90 yuan per ton, which is also commendable even though it is a drop in the bucket. We sincerely hope that the major coal merchants will not give in, and at the same time hope that the authorities of the two concessions will pay close attention and come to the rescue. The small-scale coal briquette factories will stop one after another within a week due to the exhaustion of raw materials. At that time, not only will the supply of coal briquettes in the market be reduced, but also a group of unemployed workers will be added.</p>

<h3 id="e75">Even if the Municipal Council Can Increase Donations, It Should Still Strive to Economize, 69% of Municipal Revenue is Spent on Salaries, Foreign Exchange Allowances, etc., Major Cities Do Not Have This Type of Distribution Method <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>The Mainland News editorial on the 29th stated that what must be stated again is that the Mainland News is not obstructing the Municipal Council's proposed donation increase. The shortsighted and wasteful policies of the council in the past have made increasing donations at this time the only remedy to save financial life. Therefore, increasing donations by 15% has no other way, no matter what impact it has on the residents of the Public Concession economically, except to</p>
<p>Implement this proposal</p>
<p>The editorial of the Daily News has no objection to the urgent need for increased donations at this time. We understand its urgency and are prepared to firmly protect it. However, the point that we have repeatedly emphasized is that the Municipal Council urgently needs to adopt a more prudent and economical policy. We believe that there is no need to regret it, but if the Municipal Council is to be saved, then the taxpayers here must not allow it to repeat the</p>
<p>Regretful</p>
<p>Mistake. The Municipal Council spends too much on staff salaries, pensions, and other temporary expenses, which is our main concern and is also of concern to other residents of the Public Concession. The Daily News editorial on Tuesday stated that out of the 25,908,680 yuan of revenue of the Municipal Council in 1939, no less than 18,000,000 yuan was spent on salaries, pensions, foreign exchange, and travel allowances. Therefore, supporting Municipal Council employees accounted for 69% of municipal revenue.</p>
<p>Cities All Over the World</p>
<p>No matter how large or well-managed they are, they rarely spend 69% of their income on salaries, pensions, and allowances like the Municipal Council. To confirm this statement, we telegraphed Tokyo and Manila to request the budget figures of the two cities. The replies are as follows. Manila City Finance Officer Alfonso telegraphed that Manila's revenue in 1938 totaled 10,153,675.22 pesos, of which 3,271,38.99 pesos were</p>
<p>Spent on Teachers</p>
<p>Police officers and firefighters' salaries, other salaries and allowances for municipal staff, reached 707,340.07 pesos. Staff salaries, personnel expenses, and allowances totaled 2,978,723.06 pesos, accounting for about 14% of total revenue. According to news from Tokyo, the revenue of the Tokyo Municipal Government in 1937 totaled 125,701,000 Japanese yen, of which only 10.5% was used for salaries, administration, and</p>

<p>The Continental News reports that Dr. Millikan, President of the California Institute of Technology in the United States, is a world-renowned scientist. Recently, with funding from the Carnegie Institution of New York, he, along with Dr. Neher and Dr. Picard, went to India to collect materials on cosmic rays. After three months, they are now</p>
<p>on their way back to America</p>
<p>and arrived in Shanghai yesterday (the 28th). According to their discussion, if more is known about cosmic rays, the entire state of human life may change greatly. They obtained excellent materials from their trip to India, which enabled people to further understand the nature of science. According to one theory, cosmic rays have a great influence on human changes and evolution. To put it simply, if humans</p>
<p>originated from apes,</p>
<p>then cosmic rays have contributed to this evolution. If so, what will become of humans in the future? A part of it may be determined by cosmic rays. This is one of the most significant discoveries of this century. The increase in human knowledge of cosmic rays has a greater impact on human life than any previous invention. If it were not for Newton, Galileo and others</p>
<p>studying astronomy,</p>
<p>then the principles used to evolve ancient cultures into modern civilization might never have been . Discovered in 1910, when in India, he put recording instruments in balloons and lifted them to the top of the atmosphere for detection. These experiments must be conducted in the equatorial zone, which is why he went to India. Cosmic rays are shot</p>
<p>from all parts of the sky to the ground</p>
<p>with electrons, and their energy is very large, but they are blocked by magnetic fields. He measured the total energy of cosmic rays shot to the ground in Ugla, India, at magnetic latitude seven degrees, and from the difference between the total energy measured in the two places, he can accurately know the number of electrons, thereby laying the foundation for a better understanding of the origin and nature of cosmic rays. His purpose in going to India was for this.</p>

<p>Yuanfeng Hardware Store, No. 5, North Shanxi Middle Road, was opened by He Xitang, a Wuxi native, and has been in operation for many years. His partner in the store, Lu Renchang, a Wuxi native, is usually very diligent in his work, so six years ago, He gave Lu the position of manager, and Lu was fully responsible for all affairs in the store.

<p>English and American Exchange Buying Activity Increases; Large Amounts of Foreign Rice Settlements for Days; Foreign Exchange Market Inevitably Affected</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: HSBC's listed prices remained unchanged. The black market conditions for English and American exchanges were generally soft. This was mainly due to the robust sales of foreign rice in recent days, leading to numerous settlements. Additionally, speculative traders were actively involved, resulting in strong buying interest. Foreign banks such as American Express and Chase National Bank also absorbed a large volume. Although HSBC released first telegraphic transfers at 4 pence 1/25, the amount reached a substantial 100,000+ pounds. Furthermore, due to tight monetary conditions, money changers released US dollar drafts in the morning, also in large quantities, but these were all absorbed, ultimately leading to a tightening to 0.15625 and 0.0625. The dollar was tighter than the pound due to the shrinking US-UK exchange rates overseas. The morning opening for buying and selling was generally flat, remaining at 4 pence 1/40625 and 6.825 yuan. Subsequently, foreign banks like American Express and China &amp; South Sea Bank initiated buying sprees. Foreign firms also actively settled for March-April terms. Coupled with speculative traders piling in, and a certain bank initially offering, then abruptly turning to frantic absorption, despite the releases from money changers and HSBC, the supply still felt inadequate, causing the market trend to shift during the day. However, by the afternoon closing, it had narrowed to 4 pence 2/15 and 6.75 yuan. Fortunately, HSBC continued to support in the afternoon, stabilizing the trend. However, once HSBC ceased buying, the exchange rate briefly jumped to 4 pence 1/9075 and 6.071875 yuan. Although Chinese merchants and oil firms still had buying appetite afterward, HSBC resumed supply, and other foreign banks were also slightly more willing to release, so by the evening closing, the English and American exchange rates remained similar to the afternoon closing. Due to more activity in futures, they were slightly separated from the spot market.</p>

Central Bank's listed exchange rates remained as before. Banks' morning opening spot selling prices: English gold 4 pence 1/40625, US exchange 6.8125 yuan, with no increase or decrease compared to the previous closing. After opening, American Express was the first foreign bank to settle. Chase National Bank and another bank from the same group were buying spot US exchange at 6.8125 yuan. Soon after, Banque Belge pour l'Etranger also absorbed US dollar drafts from money changers at 6.84375 yuan. At this time, a certain foreign firm also purchased March US exchange from Banque Franco-Chinoise at 6.6875 yuan, so the situation looked slightly tight. At that time, spot prices were difficult to settle and sell at 4 pence 1/40625 and 6.78125 yuan. HSBC's listed prices were announced to be unchanged, the silver balance tax was announced to be up 1.5 fen. After that, the foreign firm sector continued to pile settle for March-April terms, and the bullish speculative traders also slightly increased their positions, and a certain bank had changed their mind to buy. The market trend continued to slightly tighten. It was calculated that foreign firms and Chinese merchants settled with Chase National Bank for March US exchange at 6.6525 yuan, and foreign firms also purchased April US exchange from Banque Franco-Chinoise at 6.5625 yuan. Also, a certain bank bought HSBC spot English gold at 4 pence 1/25, and absorbed US dollar drafts from money changers at 6.8125 yuan. Extending to the afternoon closing, English remaining at 4 pence 1/25, US exchange at 6.75 yuan, compared to the morning opening, English shrank 0.015625, US tightened 0.065.</p>
<p>HSBC Releases More Than 100,000 Pounds</p>
<p>In the afternoon market, Banque Franco-Chinoise and Chase National Bank had quite an appetite, fortunately, HSBC continued to maintain, so the situation was still stable. It was heard that current telegraphic transfers at 4 pence 1/25 were actually opened for more than 100,000 pounds. Among them, the foreign firm sector also settled in. Later, because HSBC stopped selling, and speculative traders continued to be active, the exchange rate once shouted tight past 4 pence 1.09375 and 6.71875 yuan. At that time, March US exchange at 6.65625 yuan was difficult to settle.

<h3 id="e93">Bull Market Activities Major; Gold Prices Rising Again; Ultimately, Tight Monetary Conditions Make It Difficult for Bulls to Get Their Wish; Calculated in US Dollars, Still More Than 300 Yuan Lower <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot cash gold black market situation, following the tightening of foreign exchange, saw a resurgence of rising prices. Furthermore, the Hong Kong gang's activities were quite intense, and a certain bank constantly absorbed. Also, a certain securities gang and a certain gold firm first sold and then suddenly bought back in, so the result was a squeeze up 74 yuan. However, due to extremely tight monetary conditions, high posting water, and the difficulty of obtaining banknotes, it is not surprising that bulls are unable to get their wish, and we will see a skyrocketing of 100+ yuan. Moreover, based on the US dollar exchange rate calculation, gold prices were again pressed down by 330-340 yuan. The morning opening was still flat, with the price at 4,790 yuan. Subsequently, due to a certain gold firm abandoning their position, it once fell back a small 2 yuan, retreating to a low price of 4,788 yuan. Then, the exchange market tightened, securities gangs and money changers and a certain bank competed to buy, rising as high as 4,827 yuan. However, after this, the buying wind slightly stopped, and a certain securities gang forcefully released, falling back to 4,810 yuan. Unexpectedly, the Hong Kong gang suddenly became active, and with the exchange market still soft, a certain bank again went in to pick up, in the afternoon, gold firms and securities gangs suddenly switched from selling to buying, frantically absorbing, and the Hong Kong gang continued to be active, once reaching a high peak of 4,870 yuan. After entering, floating bulls took profits and released, slightly declining. Up to the evening closing, it was 4,862 yuan. After the closing, gold firms re-entered, rising again to 4,870 yuan. The total transaction volume for the day was approximately 2,500 taels. Silver ornament gold was listed higher by 5 yuan, customs gold, etc., remained flat.</p>
<p>Starting with each bar (10 taels), the initial situation was still flat. First, the silversmith gang purchased 30 taels from a certain gold firm, at 4,790 yuan, an increase of 2 yuan compared to the previous closing. Then, a certain gold firm released 20 taels to the same industry, at 4,788 yuan. After a short while, the foreign exchange market was soft, and securities gangs were the first to drag in. Coupled with certain banks and money industries also buying and selling each other, it rose 39 yuan. Money changers entered a gold firm for 50 taels, at 4,827 yuan. Afterwards, a certain securities gang suddenly came to release, and money changers and silversmith gangs also threw out, while the buying party had less appetite, so it fell back a small 17 yuan. Securities gangs sold 30 taels to money changers, at 4,810 yuan. Around 10:45, the exchange market continued to report slightly tighter, and with the Hong Kong gang suddenly becoming active, a certain bank and a certain money changer also came back to search and buy, rising again 22 yuan. Money changers entered securities gangs for 50 taels, at 4,832 yuan. At that time, retail investors saw the Hong Kong gang stop entering, and immediately came to release at a high price, so it fell back a small 12 yuan. The silversmith gang released 10 taels to money changers, at 4,820 yuan. At noon, a certain money changer reinvigorated the buying wind, and a certain bank continued to absorb, so it was pulled up again 16 yuan. A certain bank entered the silversmith gang for 10 taels, at 4,836 yuan. The silversmith gang then released 30 taels to securities firms, at 4,835 yuan, as the noon closing price. The afternoon market was even tighter, opening rose 15 yuan. Silversmith gangs did 30 taels with each other, at 4,850 yuan. After a while, it fell back slightly 5 yuan. The silversmith industry sold 10 taels to gold firms, at 4,845 yuan. Afterwards, as foreign exchange continued to tighten, a certain gold firm and securities gang competed to buy, and another gold firm and a certain silversmith also searched in place of the Hong Kong gang, so it rose 25 yuan. Money changers released 10 taels to securities gangs, at 4,870 yuan. After entering, money changers and a certain bank suddenly came to release, but buyers had turned less, falling back 15 yuan. Spot gold firms sold 20 taels to money changers, at 4,855 yuan. Approaching the closing, ultimately a certain gold firm's buying interest re-emerged, and it raised again 7 yuan. Gold firms entered securities gangs for 50 taels, at 4,862 yuan, as the evening closing price. As a result, compared to the previous day, it was squeezed up 74 yuan. After the closing, gold firms continued to buy, raising it to 4,870 yuan. A total of 82 yuan up and down throughout the day.

<p>Foreign Rice Fluctuations Are Enormous; It Can Be Seen That It Is a Speculative Market</p>
<p>The rice market, which has been falling for the past week, is currently moving with solid demand, with a turnaround seen in seconds. Yesterday, the local shops' outlets were quite lively, while merchants and general speculative traders held large quantities of rice grain in their hands, not only were they willing to throw out rice, but they also pulled it in single-mindedly. Under this situation, the market trended upwards again, so at the initial opening, Saigon No. 1 rose 1 yuan, selling at 46.5 yuan. Afterwards, it continued to rise step by step, reaching 47 yuan. Huojiao initially was 45 yuan, then shouted up to 46 yuan, more sought after than Saigon, calculated at about 2 yuan. However, because it was too high, after the special purchase of the Pagoda brand at 45.8 yuan for one or two bars, the actual sale price of all other brands was only 45.5 yuan. The situation for other goods was similar. Only Tokyo polished rice, although its outlets were not extensive, its market also brought up with the other goods, but the number was only half a yuan or so, especially sold at 42.5 yuan to 41.5 yuan. From morning to noon, the rice market saw changes, regardless of wholesale customer appetite. The overall situation immediately turned to hover. Momentarily, general floating hoarders saw solid demand and suddenly their thoughts became sluggish. The market color swayed as if there was a pullback trend, and suddenly they threw out all the goods in their hands, causing the returning goods to be abundant at once, immediately showing an oversupply, and the upward market trend saw defeat and turned downstream. Moving to noon, its closing market, if Saigon No. 1 had already depreciated by half a yuan compared to the morning market, to 46 yuan. Huojiao, because the booming trend was already fierce, the return trend was not fierce, and it had already reached 44.5 yuan, a reduction of 1 yuan compared to the morning price, with a mere increase of half a yuan compared to the previous market. As for Saigon No. 2, Siamese pointed small grain mixed broken, etc., all rose high, and all fell low. Although market prices had discrepancies, the environment was indeed consistent. The glutinous rice sales market, yesterday, was not able to be called smooth, so those who opened had few national goods, and the market color was slightly beautiful by half a yuan. Thick and thin Japonica rice and early and late inland sources of rice, due to rain and snow working together, had not turned out, and in the field black market, it was heard that foreign rice trended upwards, and good yuan grade, Pu tip, which had been cold for a long time, had a black market that had opened at 47 yuan, it is said.</p>
<p>Foreign rice original package transactions returned February-March, Saigon No. 2 rose to 53 yuan then shifted against 52.5 yuan, Siamese No. 2 was from 52.6 yuan to 52 yuan, small grain initial opening 51.23 yuan, then rose as high as 52 yuan, in the afternoon father returned to 51.5 yuan, totaling 700-800 tons traded.</p>

Jardine Matheson's Yongwang Wheel, this time again loaded 16,212 packages from Hong Kong, anchored at the Roosevelt Wharf in the French Concession on the evening of the 28th, and started unloading yesterday morning.

<p>Flour Yesterday's market was again falling. It was found that the registered flour mill's disc had already stipulated a 10 yuan flat sale, and the expiry has not been reached, so there will be no changes temporarily. However, the returning goods have already loosened secretly, although the fall is limited, if compared with the highest special, the difference is quite substantial, because at present, there are few sources of supply for stack order flour, and the local customer sales are also very bland. In this quiet situation, it is being reduced daily. It was heard that yesterday, the old car brand fell from 14.4 yuan to 0.2 yuan, the green artillery car customer disc was also only 15.23 yuan, the market artillery car has fallen inside the 15 yuan range. Total market transaction small price flour totaled however 10,000 packages were sold it is said.</p>
<p>Wheat Yesterday, there were not many transactions, because Chinese factories will soon have large batches of foreign wheat transported to them. Export gangs also thought that the transportation was not worthwhile. The intention to enter the market was sluggish. Only Japanese factories, etc., selectively took and handled it. The total market only opened for Wuhu wheat at 24 yuan to 23.5 yuan, falling by more than 1 yuan compared to the previous day.</p>

It was heard that today's stock settlement will be more than 50 million yuan, and cotton yarn arbitrage settlement will be more than 200 million yuan. Speculators are concentrated in these two markets, and the public debt situation is even more depressed. Although the same industry still slightly embellishes it, most large firms have already satisfied themselves. In the morning, Taifeng had slight buying, and Dingkang sold out. In the afternoon, Zhong Shenkang had slight buying, and Dachong sold out. That was all. As a result, except for the under kind which did not open, all other returns were small 1-1.5 dimes.

<p>The yarn market continues to rise, since the rising wind is raging, this is because the foreign exchange has seen a slight contraction, the speculative mood of general non-professionals is extremely strong, and the buying wind is becoming more and more dramatic, so the horizontal surface is tight, and the buying households see one after another coming, so the market disc has risen sharply. The March term Double Horse highest peak has risen to as much as 912 yuan.</p>

<p>The spot cotton trade saw another improvement, but the factory needs are still lacking, and the peer-to-peer buying and selling is secretive in its development. This is because the exchange market is tightening and yarn prices are腾, and people's hearts are agitated, so the selling prices have also risen by 2-4 yuan. Tongzhou Dasi seems to be done at 215 yuan, the fire machine packing price is 202.5 yuan, the Subei source arrived Tonghua 1,127 packages, and the current cotton situation is listed on the left.</p>
<p>In addition, the spot cotton market price, New York cotton market, yesterday exhibited the initial cause because overseas cotton merchants purchased in China, rising 3-5 British pounds, then because the public sold and a portion of the limit price selling倒, so the closing market returned to being exhausted, resulting in a decrease of 3 British pounds in both the near-term and return-term compared to the previous day, India's transportation forecast also rose 3 rupees, Egypt rose more than 10 British pounds.</p>

<p>Sir,</p>
<p>I recently read in your newspaper on February 27 a news item about "Cooked Coal Also Has a Monopoly," which is clearly inconsistent with the facts. According to our firm, since we have been the sole agent for Silaihuo cooked coal, the supply to all sectors has never been interrupted. Now, because the firm's output is decreasing day by day, the daily output supplied to various public groups and contract users is still not enough to meet the needs. We are very sorry for the burden. Currently, our firm is working hard to ensure that when the firm's output is large, it will definitely provide customers with a source of energy. The words "large accumulation for hoarding and monopoly" are likely a misrepresentation of the facts. We hope that you will correct them as soon as possible to correct the public's views.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Shanghai Cooked Coal Firm</p>
<p>To: Economic News Department, Shen Bao</p>

<p>— Editor</p>
<p>Reply to Mr. Ding Juerong and a Reader</p>
<p>To Mr. Ding Juerong and a Reader: Your letter and the attached revenue stamps have been received. After careful examination, the two types of stamps are indeed quite different. We specifically took them to the Chamber of Commerce for inquiry. The Chamber of Commerce office confirmed that one of them is indeed counterfeit. However, after printing, the details are blurry and unclear, making it difficult to distinguish between genuine and fake. Therefore, we are detailing the differences below:</p>
<p>(1) The format of the genuine stamp is larger.</p>
<p>(2) The pagoda image in the counterfeit stamp is blurry and unclear.</p>
<p>(3) The genuine stamp is dark green, while the counterfeit stamp is grass green.</p>
<p>(4) The genuine stamp has hard-pressed imprints on the back, while the counterfeit one does not.</p>
<p>(5) The paper of the counterfeit stamp is thinner.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Chamber of Commerce has entrusted us to inform all businesses that if they wish to purchase stamps, please purchase them directly from the various trade associations. If there are hawkers selling them on the streets, please be sure to distinguish between genuine and fake. If anyone is found selling counterfeit stamps, immediately hand them over to the authorities for strict punishment.</p>

<p>— Yu Xiangyun</p>
<p>In Shanghai, it seems that only large pharmacies "privately view" ginseng and bird's nest, jewelry stores "privately view" precious jewelry, and diamond shops "privately view" diamonds when it comes to cautious transactions where shop owners lead customers inside to "privately view" goods. Apart from these, I haven't heard of other stores taking customers inside to "privately view" goods.</p>
<p>However, now, rice shops have also started this trick. Yesterday, when I poked my head through the window to ask the shop assistant about rice prices, they readily replied, "Top-grade foreign Xian rice is fifty-two, second-grade is forty-eight." I then explained to them that I didn't need foreign Xian rice; I wanted to buy domestic rice and asked them to show me the appearance of the domestic rice.</p>
<p>A shop assistant, smiling, nodded repeatedly and said, "Yes, yes, yes! Please come in, the domestic rice is inside." Then, he instructed an apprentice to open a section of the securely closed shop door and let me in.</p>
<p>I entered, and he politely led me through an iron gate into a room that resembled both an accounting office and a bedroom. He turned on the electric light and then brought out many samples of domestic rice, placing them on the iron square table. He pointed with his finger, grinning, and said, "This one is forty-eight, this one is fifty-two, this one is fifty-six..." After stating the prices, he paused and added, "There isn't much of this fifty-six yuan kind, you can only buy it by the dan (a unit of weight)."</p>
<p>I stared at the rice samples, my heart pounding like wild horses galloping. Nearly sixty yuan for a dan of rice, this squeeze on life will truly turn people into starving corpses.</p>
<p>At that time, I chose the forty-eight yuan one and bought two dan. I paid him the money and then wrote down an address, instructing him to issue an invoice and deliver it.</p>
<p>But, unexpectedly, not only did they refuse to issue an invoice, they also refused to deliver. I then argued on principle, questioning their reasons, but they just smiled and said, "You're a knowledgeable person, you're quite familiar with the situation in the market, we also have our difficulties." It was then that I guessed the reason they refused to issue an invoice: to avoid legal responsibility, preventing outsiders from providing evidence of their violation of price limits. It can truly be said to be extremely clever!</p>

<h3 id="e108">Everyone Lost <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>— Peng</p>
<p>At the end of last year, colleagues in the office proposed renting a company room, saying that everyone could bring their families to take baths, and have a place to play during the Spring Festival holiday. After two years of hard work, it was a rare opportunity, so naturally everyone was willing to participate. After the office reopened on the third day of the new year, the room could have been returned. However, the "lucky money" won from mahjong in those few days was enough to cover the room rental for several more days; no one suggested it, and everyone "understood" to continue renting the room. As soon as the office closed, everyone crowded together again, some playing cards, some dancing, and the daily "lucky money" was enough to rent the room long-term. This continued until the Lantern Festival, when the number of people in the room gradually decreased. This wasn't because "the fun had run out," but because several colleagues had lost too much money. As a result, the card players struggled to find "partners," and the dancers had no "companions." In such a situation, naturally no one needed to suggest returning the room.</p>
<p>After reflecting on the pain, when it was first proposed, everyone contributed five yuan. At the end of the accounting, there was even a surplus of three jiao and a few fen of "lucky money" left over. It seemed like each person only spent a little over four yuan for those twenty days, which seemed like a good deal. However, the daily room rent, meals, cigarettes, etc., cost at least twenty yuan, wasn't it all coming out of everyone's pockets? Except it wasn't directly paid, but indirectly through the mahjong games.</p>
<p>The lesson of "everyone lost" made us realize: if we had to raise such a large sum of money in advance to rent a room for twenty days, there would definitely be opposition. But now, because the mahjong "lucky money" was the middleman, we unknowingly spent so much money. This shows how harmful gambling is!</p>
<p>If we go further, besides the room rent being obtained by a third party, the rest was shared and enjoyed by everyone. However, those gambling dens have to pay a million yuan in "protection fees" every month, as well as even greater expenses. So, is there any hope for those who gamble to win money?</p>
<p>Therefore, I am writing down our lesson of "everyone lost," hoping that those who harbor a "chance-taking mentality" will take it as a serious warning.</p>

<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 21: Managing Finances by Mixing Fabric Quality, Building Machinery to Assist with Literary Achievements</p>
<p>Three years ago, Jiang Jingrong also went to Europe and America to inspect silk fabrics. He felt that among the European countries, France and Italy were the most particular about silk fabrics. The other countries were a bit lacking. Because France and Italy both produce silk, and their industries are also highly developed. He also felt that Chinese silk fabrics were very easy and smooth to sell abroad. However, first, silk fabric merchants must broaden their horizons. In the past, our country's silk fabric merchants only sought the domestic market, not the foreign market. For example, when a new silk fabric is produced, as long as it suits the preferences of domestic gentlemen and ladies, the quality, color, and pattern must be carefully considered so that everyone likes to use it, and that kind of material can be sold well. Now that we want to sell it abroad, we must explore the preferences of foreign gentlemen and ladies. Jiang Jingrong also saw Chinese silks and satins displayed in department stores in Europe and America. But he felt that there were still few, and they could not compete with the products of France and Italy. Moreover, they were only the fabrics that can be commonly seen in the country, not the products specially made for European and American gentlemen and ladies. Jiang Jingrong also meant that he did not refuse the sale of European and American silk fabrics to China, and he was also willing to sell Chinese silk fabrics to European and American countries. In European and American countries, men's clothes are mostly made of wool fabrics, and women's clothes are mostly made of silk fabrics, especially in the spring and summer. He and the father of the two Miss He were old friends. He went to Beiping for the distribution of a silk shop and also for a woolen fabric factory in Beiping, and he was busy for more than a month. Because he talked about silk fabrics with Mr. He, and he also knew that the two Miss He had returned from studying textile majors in the United States, everyone talked happily, so they organized this silk weaving factory. According to Jiang Jingrong's idea, it must be done on a large scale, and the funds must be more than 10 million yuan. He said: We are not doing business with the Chinese, we are determined to do business with foreigners. Producing such expensive silk fabrics in China seems to be guiding the Chinese people to extravagance. In the emerging China, we must strive for frugality. In European and American countries, they can afford it after all, and they don't care. Moreover, Chinese wages are cheaper than foreign wages. The cost of the same thing produced in China can be at least one-third cheaper. Therefore, he said: In foreign trade, as long as the products are excellent and cater to the preferences of Europeans and Americans, we are not afraid that the sales will not develop. Now that the two Miss He are organizing this silk weaving factory, they also intend to promote Chinese silk fabrics to foreign countries, and this purpose coincides. (244)</p>

<p>— Jin Rong</p>
<p>Editor: After seeing Mr. Cheng's article "Attention to Families Stealing Rice" in your publication, I thought that in today's world of "rice like pearls and firewood like cinnamon," attention should also be paid to buying coal balls.</p>
<p>A week ago, just when coal balls were soaring to six yuan and eight jiao per dan, my family happened to run out of coal balls. I then called for a dan of coal balls from a nearby coal shop. When they were delivered, I borrowed a scale and weighed them with the delivery person. Although there was no cheating with the scale bar, the result was still short in weight. One basket was forty-seven jin, and the other was forty-six jin, totaling only ninety-three jin. After deducting the weight of the two baskets, the actual weight was less than ninety jin, which was a difference of ten jin from the standard one hundred jin per dan, equivalent to about seven jiao. When I argued with them, they said, "The coal balls were weighed by the boss, I don't know anything." Shanghai families who use coal balls have never paid attention to the weight, and they take advantage of this to use their tricks. Usually, when the price is low, there is no need to be too concerned about this, but in today's world of soaring prices, we must take it seriously. On the one hand, we can stop their deceptive methods, and on the other hand, we can also reduce our financial losses, especially for economic families like ours, who can't bear such unexpected exploitation.</p>
<p>I think this shortage of weight is not limited to rice and coal balls. Other items may also have this situation. I hope that their dark secrets can be exposed at any time.</p>

<h3 id="e112">Hollywood Actresses Choose Their Ideal Man <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>— Xin Ying</p>
<p>First, Have Courage; Second, Have Money</p>
<p>In the eyes of Hollywood actresses, what kind of man do they love the most? This question is often asked, but it is difficult to get an answer. However, recently, the actresses in Warner Bros. Pictures had the opportunity to find an answer. A total of eighteen actresses participated, who could answer the questions freely. Only one of them was a young and beautiful girl, and all the other participants have had considerable success on the screen and are quite happy in their families. Here is a brief description of how they chose their favorite man.</p>
<p>List of Participating Actresses</p>
<p>The actresses who participated in the selection this time include Salome, Pamela, Lucile Mayline, Ann Sheridan, Sally Wheat, Joan Blair, Gin Hammerman, Violet Marschall, Ellis, Ganell Punch, Marys Lichsen, Margot Stevenson, Rosale Dunn, Nancy Van Brevet, Mary Ann Dean, Gin Ganelbert, Rosale Van Punk, Macy Robertson, etc. The last one is a 75-year-old stage star and movie star.</p>
<p>Seven Types of Men</p>
<p>Bette Davis was unable to participate because she was taking a long vacation in New England after filming a movie. Cary Grant also did not participate, because he was vacationing in Ireland. For convenience, each participating actress was given a form listing seven types of men: (1) a man with courage and leadership who can be a master, (2) a wealthy man, (3) a very handsome man, (4) a man who is good at humor, (5) a man who is knowledgeable, (6) a man who is cautious, (7) a man who is passionate.</p>
<p>Everyone Loves Courage</p>
<p>The results of the selection put the man with courage first, indicating that he is the most loved. Ten out of the eighteen people ranked him first, and five people ranked him second. No one ranked the handsome man first, and only three people ranked him second. But two people ranked the passionate man first, and four people ranked him second. Three of the youngest actresses ranked the wealthy man first, and two others ranked the wealthy man second. Five people ranked the man who is good at humor second. The knowledgeable man is truly somewhat pitiful compared to the courageous man. Only two people chose him first, and two people chose him second. Not a single vote was cast for the cautious man.</p>
<p>Why Still Need Money</p>
<p>Therefore, after such a selection, a certainty was obtained. Hollywood actresses hope that men first have courage and second have money. Perhaps some lovers will be surprised that actresses can earn a lot of money themselves, so why do they still want men to have money?</p>
<h3 id="e113">Small Suggestions for Filming "Dream of the Red Chamber" <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>— Movie Fan</p>
<p>I am very excited about the news of Xin Tie filming the entire "Dream of the Red Chamber" movie, which was previously published by Mr. Bingbing in this column. "Dream of the Red Chamber" is a famous novel in our country's old novels. It can be said that everyone knows it. If it is used to make a movie, its power to attract audiences is of course very great; but the characters in it are numerous, and each character has its own personality, so it is really not easy to select many actors who can suit the characters in the play. Seeing that the decision is to spend 100,000 yuan to build the Daguan Garden scene in the Lilac Garden, it can be imagined how much the company attaches importance to the film. I don't know what the structure of this film is, so let's not talk about it for the time being. What needs attention here is the issue of casting.</p>
<p>Then let me try to suggest it now. First of all, I think the most important thing to consider is the role of Jia Baoyu. If you let those popular male stars play the role of a young master who spends all day in the powder team, likes to eat lipstick on women's mouths, and has the demeanor of a girl, there will definitely be no good results, because they are not the kind of soft bones and will not make people feel pity; if they reluctantly describe Baoyu's appearance, what we will see will probably just be a creepy disgusting thing. May I ask, can they become a fifteen or sixteen-year-old playboy? I believe, who else can be competent for this role except Yuan Meiyun? We have seen a lot of her male costume dramas. If we close our eyes and think, we will feel that all her advantages are most appropriate to play Baoyu; moreover, this kind of gimmick is also the most liked by Shanghai people.</p>
<p>It seems good to have Gu Lanjun play Xue Baochai, and it seems more appropriate for Chen Yanyan to play Lin Daiyu, but she is a little fat. I don't know how Zhou Xuan is. Please give me some advice.</p>

<p>— Lin Shaoqing</p>
<p>Listening to Huang Jin Er Jin Gong (Part 2)</p>
<p>Xi Chang's Yuanban "I am Like" uses Yan Jupeng's tune, which I don't think is right. One is that the tune is too fancy and there is no emotion to speak of; the other is that the board position is wrong, which is not as generous as the old tune. The good words of the old tune should be on the eyes. Below, Xi Chang does not have words such as spring, summer, autumn, winter, fishing, farming, reading, painting, etc. I say this is very good. The old words originally had these patterns, so you must use the old tune to sing them. At least you have to sing Wang Jiuling's tune to be good. Singing Tan's tune has no burden at all.</p>
<p>If you sing old words with a new tune, it is better not to sing them. Moreover, this singing is a memorial to the emperor, not telling a story to an old woman. Yi Xinpei's deletion is indeed insightful. Then, they sang Liu Kuai's Yuanban. Qiu Shengrong and Xi Xiaobo both rush to sing the last word, that is, the big face sings to the last word. The old Sheng doesn't wait for the last word of the big face to be sung before taking over, and the first word is sung on the board at the same time as the last word of the big face. The big face also takes over in the same way, which is called rushing the board. This kind of singing method is to show skill, but the last word of each sentence is bound to have the disadvantage of being difficult to hear clearly. Also, this kind of singing method makes the board slot too fast, and the Dan role also has the difficulty of not being able to catch up. The old role originally had a non-rushing board singing method here, which is better than this. I advocate that it is not appropriate to rush the board, so that all three people can sing more comfortably. According to the reason, this play should be sung comfortably, not cramped, so that people will not be nervous listening to it.</p>

<p>— Tina</p>
<p>Two years ago, an American magazine asked the question "Why do you watch movies?" and publicly solicited answers. As a result, it received more than 10,000 letters from readers, with a wide variety of strange answers. The magazine specially compiled the following statistics:</p>
<p>(Answer) (Percentage)</p>
<p>Because the protagonist is my beloved star 37.81%</p>
<p>Because the script is one I like or have read 27.58%</p>
<p>Went to see it after reading reviews or hearing good reviews 14.11%</p>
<p>To accompany my husband or wife to watch it together 11.43%</p>
<p>For the magnificent scenery in the film 10.02%</p>
<p>Just to pass the time 3.54%</p>
<p>Other 1.51%</p>
<h3 id="e116">Miscellaneous Notes on "Li Xiucheng's Martyrdom" <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>— Gong Jiong</p>
<p>Although Li Xiucheng and other national heroes such as Hong Xiuquan rose up from Jintian Village together, his prudence, shrewdness, and intelligence were truly the first capable minister of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. If, in November of the thirteenth year of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, when Zeng Guofan's demon soldiers besieged Tianjing, the Heavenly King had listened to his "relocation" plan, who would have known how the history of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom would have developed?</p>
<p>The playwright unfolds the social phenomena of the time from such a meaningful character, which I think is quite ingenious, and to a certain extent, it can still give ordinary people a sense of alarm and lessons.</p>
<p>Li Xiucheng came from the ranks of ordinary people and personally experienced everything that ordinary people felt in that era; the unbearable ravages of the Tartars and the shamelessness of the traitorous Han made him realize and awaken that without resisting, without fighting, without removing the oppressors who were skinning and drinking blood on the backs of ordinary people, there was no way to live. Thus, in the bloody life, his true enthusiasm and determination to relieve the suffering of the people were nurtured.</p>
<p>Mr. Yang Hansheng seems to have grasped particularly tightly the promotion of this significance in "Li Xiucheng's Martyrdom."</p>
<p>In the second act, the emphasis on national resistance reached the highest level of that era. The concubine personally went to the battlefield to take care of and bandage the soldiers, and Grandma Liu encouraged her grandson to kill the Tartars and took care of him back and forth with her medicine box, which reminded me of Grandma Wang, the guerrilla mother who is active now.</p>
<p>The love and admiration of the common people for Prince Zhong can be said to have reached the point of madness. The precarious and turbulent Tianjing was as stable as Mount Tai when Prince Zhong returned. When Prince Zhong expressed his vow not to leave Tianjing until death, the enthusiastic cheering of the common people holding torches high was not like madness? When it was rumored that Prince Zhong had been martyred in Zeng's camp, hundreds of households of common people knelt together in front of the spirit tablet of Li Xiucheng and cried sadly, what kind of sincere and sublime emotion was that!</p>
<p>The characters arranged by the author in the play are saved to the point where they cannot be saved. Each character has a prominent personality and a close relationship with each other. Even the two supporting peasant families other than the main trunk of Li Xiucheng's family have different styles.</p>
<p>What I love most is that in this play, no matter the ups and downs of the situation or the unpredictability of the timing, it is always full of a magnificent atmosphere. This atmosphere is radiated from Li Xiucheng's personal body, shining on the common people, and is always actively advancing.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Drama Society is staging this play, hoping to bring this atmosphere to the ordinary people on the isolated island!</p>
