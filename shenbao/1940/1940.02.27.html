<p>社評</p>
<h3>中立國爭取的展開</h3>
<p>歐戰目前雖表面上在半停頓的狀態中，可是雙方的爭取中立國為與國，却在暗中異常活躍着。在這次歐洲大戰中，北歐有瑞典挪威丹麥等中立國家，西歐有荷比兩個中立國家，中歐巴爾幹，有羅，南，希，匈，土等中立國家；無論這些國家在名義保持中立，而實際上較傾向於一方而與另一方疏遠；無論交戰國的雙方，都聲明不侵犯各中立國安全。尊重其獨立；但是等到戰爭擴大開去，交戰國對於這些小國的處境，大約只有軍事的外交的策略上的考慮，而決不會因其中立的法理，或不願加入戰爭的意願，竟肯輕輕放鬆。由於上次大戰的敎訓，已可證明所謂中立，只成為最初的意願，而並非不拔的壁壘；德國在一九一四年，借道比利時，破壞比利時的中立，是其中最著名的一件事。可是類乎這樣的事，在另一方面，也並不是沒有的；一九一五年，協的國軍隊化希腦登陸、進佔了沙期匿基，以為協的國軍隊進攻馬其頓前綫的據點；並援助威尼瑞祿，推翻希臘那時不願作戰的政府，而由威氏來組成政府，加入協的國作戰。由此可知威脅利誘，無所不用其極，在上次大戰中，早已創了彰著的先例。這次戰爭爆發，以迄今日，時間尙短，而西綫戰爭亦不像上次大戰一樣，在一開始的時候，雙方就以迅雷不及掩耳的步伐，以求速戰速決，所以破壞中立國國家的事件，到目前為止，尙沒有發見；然而中立國船隻遭德國潛水艇的擊沉，交戰國的飛機。侵入中立國國境，這樣的事實，却已屢見不鮮。中立國雖提出抗議，交戰國悍然不顧者，常居十之八九；至多表示了歉意，却從未保證未來。最近英艦的搜查德國阿爾脫馬克號，雙力作為，皆在中立國領海之內，挪威雖嚴重抗議；但其結果恐怕決不是雙方從此尊重挪威的領海權吧！觀於英國對於挪威的抗議，「暫不欲予以答覆」，就是明證。隨着戰爭的開展，此後類乎這樣的事件，殆不免愈來而愈多，其關係殆亦不免愈來而愈重大。始則以利誘，繼則以威脅，終則倒在一方面而與他一方面以兵戎相見。從北歐到巴爾幹，這些國家雖則都尙在和平狀態中，但是這樣的和平因為絲毫沒有强健的保障，而祗能視為是表面的，暫時的，隨時可以破壞的。西歐的荷比，在力量上，不是德國之敵，在形勢上，介乎兩大之間；所幸這兩個國家，過去無領土的糾紛，邦交素來親睦，不致為其他國家所利用，而互相火併。北歐三國，瑞典挪威反丹麥，是同種同文的國家，利害一致，愛好和平的觀點相同，一有外來的危機，三國即互相諮詢，共同對付，所以在他們的本質上與主觀上，也必像荷比一樣，不致為第三國所利用，而有何偏私的行動。至於巴爾幹各國，號稱中立，民族最複雜，糾紛最繁重，亦為野心的國際冒險家目標所集中的焦點。這地帶在上次大戰以後，就為凡爾賽體系反反凡爾賽體系的鬥爭塲，為保持現狀國家與推翻現狀國家的大舞臺。二次大戰的前夕，因國社黨勢力的膨脹，東進政策的猛進，各國在巴爾幹的鬥爭，愈益尖銳。英法於是有保障希土羅完整的提供，這三國亦樂於接受保障；現在羅國似乎有些動搖的現象，但希土羅不參戰則已，戰必是英法的與國。不但如此，復因為西綫沉寂，英法目前不欲從法國東境，擊破德國；却由於希臘之在英法掌握中，土耳其的在英法密切連繫，英法仕近東置有重兵，其情可想而知。謂之為防蘇聯的南下，其實在蘇聯沒有攻下芬蘭前，蘇聯那有南下之理。而英法一再宣稱蘇聯在高加索方面置有重兵，與宣稱土耳其業已動員，這裏面昭示我們的趨向，是：今後戰爭的開展，或不在西綫，殆將從這一環展開而向另一環發展。戰爭不發動則已，一朝發動了之後，無可制止，無法如意收拾，好此火愈玩而愈烈；到了那時候，拉攏中立國，威迫中立國，破壞中立國的事實，必又像上次大戰中的情形一樣，將因軍事策略上的理由而不復別有所考慮了！</p>

<h3>工部局擬議加捐　引起中外人責難　列舉一般事實加以訾議市民能否負担並未顧及</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報云、工部局今（二十六日）晨宜布擬將市政總捐·特別房捐·與地稅增加百分之五十、關於此事、記者頃向一般納稅華人叩詢、彼等以爲「生活程度業已高漲、且有更形高漲之勢、工部局何能期望彼等繳納更高之捐稅、」公共租界納稅華人會對此問題、非待不久舉行特別會議、加以密切研究、則不作正式批評、</p>
<p>滙豐銀行允借千萬</p>
<p>關於工部局因財政竭蹶而擬增加各種捐稅之訊、各方深為關心、昨據工部局財務處長穆休J.W.Morcher氏對人表示、工部局為彌補此項預算不敷、已獲得上海匯豐銀行之允許、予以借款、此項借款、將待西人納稅年會之通過加稅案、然後以稅款為抵補、另據消息靈通方面稱匯豐銀行對工部局之借款數額、大致為一千萬元、此項借款如能成就、則所有預算虧空、將以各項附加稅最低加百分之五十為彌補、否則工部局之預算虧空、將益龐大、</p>
<p>英鎊付薪極不妥當</p>
<p>惟據華籍居民某領袖聲稱、工部局收入、旣全屬本地貨幣、則自初即不應雇用許多以英鎊付薪之外人、若干外人、久應以有資格華人替代之、另一主要納稅華人提出工部局音樂隊問題稱華人納稅會已一再反對維持此「奢侈品、」愛好昔樂者、聆取留聲機唱片、亦可滿足、</p>
<p>薪給階級何堪負担</p>
<p>某主要華人聲稱、渠明瞭工部局來年之經濟負担力重、但局方應不忘一事、即上海納稅人大多為新給微小之華人、彼等旣遭遇高漲之生活程度、今市捐續增、使物價更高、則彼等將無法支持、縱工部局發覺加捐乃無可避免之事、然增加什五、終覺過多、不如每隔半載一增為愈、</p>
<p>只圖收入罔顧民生</p>
<p>記者所晤納稅華人、大多斥責工部局以討論自己收入之時間為多、而商酌採取嚴峻行動、以遏止囤積居奇乘機牟利情事之時間為少、如局方使生活程度降低、則納稅人較易應付捐稅之增加、今兩租界居民因界外電費及捐稅等較低、業已紛紛遷出、</p>
<p>日佔據區何不索還</p>
<p>工部局應採較堅決之態度向日局當索還虹口·匯山·與楊樹沛諸區庶可增加收入工部局對於若干種可徵捐稅者、反不予徵收、如以上海防軍照會、無限制發給日人、即其一例、日人汽車與卡車懸防軍照會及根本無照會者、遠較英美義防軍所領照會之總數為多、若干懸防軍照會之汽車、其使用人與日防軍毫無關係、</p>
<p>外商態度別具見解</p>
<p>至於上海主要外商之一般意見、以為工部局增稅、乃莫可避免者、且應於數年前即增稅、工部局及其財務處、於已往數年內措置蠢愚、據某外商稱、上海捐稅縱增加、或尙較世界其他都市為低、例如英國房捐有高至百分之百者、最低約百分之四十、</p>
<p>表面繁榮貧困者多</p>
<p>渠意本市報紙應擁護工部局若干華人當然加以反對、但彼等應明瞭其在公共租界所得之保護、上海表面繁榮、冠於世界任何都市、貧困者或佔較大之部份、但力能繳付更高捐稅者、為數頗衆、</p>
<p>樂隊經費大可撙節</p>
<p>另一商人聲稱、工部局在經濟佈置上已鑄大錯、如絕未顧及匯率是、今局方增稅、居民欲得警務與消防保護、亦不得不繳納、但有一二項大宗支出、似非絕對必要、如音樂隊最屬不當、音樂隊僅在法租界小戲院向少數居民演奏、故渠意應撙節音樂隊之支出、移充任務艱巨之警務方面經費、警務處今已失却優良人員若干、彼等乃因薪給菲薄而辭職、</p>
<h3>僞土地局誘致　道契登記　計畫已告失敗</h3>
<p>滬郊各區人民所有之土地產權憑證、戰後由各業主存放安全處所、去歲所調「土地局」、希圖整理土地、誘致業主將產權憑證繳出、以便征收「田賦」、越時一載、因人民不願將前地政局頒發之合法土地執業證、輕易放手、故證明「土地局」誘致之計謀、已吿失敗、自去冬以來、該「局」又圖誘致外商所有之英冊道契產證、前往登記、是道契為前淸時代外商之一種地產憑證、在閘北江灣吳淞寳山一帶均有、各外商聞訊後、多置之不理、目下雖有五六家英商、致函偽「局」聲明保留彼等持有之英冊道契產權、僅為一種通知手續、截至目前止、並未有一家外商公司、依照偽「局」意旨、辦理所謂「陳報手續」故該「局」第二步計謀、使外商所有之英冊道契連同憑證前往登記之企圖、又吿失敗、</p>
<h3>謝團長　續致慰問金</h3>
<p>孤軍營因白俄無故毆擊市民一案、茲悉重傷市民陳金裕一名、尙住醫院、未得痊愈、尤以頭部為甚、據孤軍營消息、續收干城學術研究社慰勞金四十元、已照數分贈、謝團長除前次每人分致慰問金十元外、茲續致各二十元、並送自製肥皂襪子面巾等日用品、</p>
<h3>蕰藻浜大橋　日方改造</h3>
<p>吳淞蕰藻浜橋為淞滬開最大橋樑之一、民國十九年春、由市府撥款二十萬元重建、距尙未竣工時、適逢一二八事變、該橋即被十九路軍將橋面焚燬、事後工務局亦因陋就簡、祇重舖橋面、直至八一三戰起、該橋又二度遭劫、最近日方將蕰藻浜改闢商港、面積闊度六十丈、故該橋已由日方設計重建式樣與外白渡橋相似、業由來代部隊承辦進行工作、惟工程頗大、約須三年餘、始可完竣、</p>
<h3>同鄉組遊藝大會　舉行健康比賽</h3>
<p>上海難民救濟協會同鄕組勸募委員會定於三月九日起、假新世界舉行游藝大會、除增加各種游藝外、並舉行兒童健康比賽、曁百老康樂大會、用意良深、業已訂定簡章、開始登記、兒童以二歲起至十二歲、不分男女、均可參加、並由救濟分會衛生組全體醫師担任檢騐、評判標準第一名獎勵現金一百元、第二名二人各獎勵三十元、三名十人各獎勵五元、四名五十人各贈價値三元之物品、其餘參加兒童、概各有贈品、老人以七十歲以上為標準、願參加者、可向同孚路一〇二弄六號該會索取簡章、</p>
<h3>謠傳貢米禁運來滬　越督正式否認　法總領昨特聲明</h3>
<p>駐滬法國總領事鮑黛芝昨特聲明、安南總督正式否認近日米市塲謠傳、安南當局禁止西貢米運至中國之說、蓋自木年一月一日起、西貢米特准運至上海者、計五萬五千噸、且是項准許、現繼續簽發無阻、</p>
<p>米價回跌</p>
<p>米業投機商人、在市塲中散佈謠言、妄稱法屬安南將禁米出口、企圖抬高米價、自法國總領事鮑黛芝文吿發表後、市塲謠言為之頓息、米業奸商、已無所施其技倆、是以昨日米業市塲、無論國米洋秈、均回跌一二元不等、並悉現有鉅額西貢洋米、已於二月一日裝輪啟運不日即可抵滬、</p>
<p>請給外滙</p>
<p>民食調節協會辦理平糶、救濟升斗市民、因限於平糶捐款及成本關係、尙未達預期目標、上海市第一特區市民聯合會第十五·三十六·三十七區分會、昨聯名致函民食調節協會、以民食問題、嚴重情勢、尤甚往昔、危機四伏、懇呈當局援引前例、對本市今後平糶洋米、特准給予法定外匯、以解貧民倒懸、而抑漲風、</p>
<p>施振擴展</p>
<p>慈善團體聯合會自昨日起、據充施賑饅首　湯、新勘定馬白路戈登路口玉佛寺後空塲、於昨日下午四時起、與大華路同時施發、查該處附近貧民聚居、故待賑人數異常擁擠、總計不下五千餘人、又本埠佛敎同仁會自舉辦施發粥票以來、成績頗為良好、茲該會新近印製大批粥票、供各界施撥、每元二十張、以二元為單位、所得之票、由持票人自己散發、並可委託該會代發、頗收實効、</p>
<h3>郵政總局大廈　被圈入警戒區　日方意向迄未明瞭工部局及各界重視</h3>
<p>自滬戰發生後虹口區域即由日軍暫時管轄、華人進出、除須執有「通行證」外、並時遭搜檢、至欲前往四川路橋堍之郵政管理局者、則可由北蘇州路該局側門出入、尙稱便利、詎於本月二十四日下午、日方突以「租界部隊指揮部」名義、在北蘇州路自來水橋堍東側、佈置鐵絲網架、阻斷車輛、並豎立木牌一方、通吿須由四川路橋及文監師路進出、而四川路橋堍西側之鐵絲網架、雖已於同時撤除、然郵局大門、則迄未開啟、</p>
<p>進出麻煩</p>
<p>自是各界前往郵政總局者、均須繞過、且日兵不時施行檢查、倍感麻煩、多改由支局寄遞、郵周全體人員、亦惶惶不安、郵務長乍配林、已電呈昆明郵政總局請示辦法、以此舉實際上不啻將郵政管理局、圈入虹口警戒區城以內、殊予公衆以甚大之不便、</p>
<p>意向不明</p>
<p>乍配林氏以日方上項特殊行動、向工部局探詢、亦米明日方之意向、乍氏嗣於昨日午後二時、派日籍副郵務長金指謹一郞、前往日領署及關係方面交涉、惟尙未得復、至工部局對此事、亦極重視、大通社記者昨日午後、曾赴該局視察、二樓營業處、投寄郵件及辦理其他郵務上寄遞事項之公衆、大為减少、一樓包裏交寄處、待寄之包裹、更為寥落、蓋公衆以行走上旣有不便、致間接影響郵局之業務也、故外間對此事件、極為屬目、</p>
<h3>滬西意軍防區　加緊宵禁</h3>
<p>自上海工部局與偽市府簽訂滬西越界築路臨時警權協定後、工部局警務處對於該處一帶警力、特別增强、該區管轄之意國駐防軍、自前晚起、突然加緊宵禁、午夜零時三十分後、滬西勞勃生路·膠州路·星加坡路·曹家渡·白利南路·極司非而路等處、遺派巡邏隊數隊、每隊人數約二十名左右、輪班逡巡、直至翌晨九時止、凡行人有可疑者、即帶入膠州公園對面之意兵營中、聞意兵此項舉動、無非為遏止非法蠢動、藉以維持防區內之治安、</p>
<h3>市商會函工部局　商減煤屑運費　安南煤屑全從海防運來運費高昂影響煤球成本</h3>
<p>上海市商會此次與上海市機製煤球業同業公會迭次磋商、抑低煤球市價、知照各煤球廠、盡量生產、以冀煤球現貨充斥、供求得克相衡、上海市商會爲治本之計、特致函公共租界工部局、原函云、「逕啟者、查本市煤球漲價、居民燃料、發生恐慌一事、迭經本會與機製煤球業同業公會商議、請其轉令各煤球廠、盡量生產、壓平售價、惟本市煤球原料所需煤屑、完全仰給於法屬安南煤礦、每日約計一千噸、月需三萬噸、全從海防運來、現在輪船運費高漲、影響煤球生產成本、此實為平定煤球售價之障碍、本會與該業籌商冉四、僉謂惟有函商貴局、定期召集各輪船公司、磋商如何减低裝運水脚辦法、俾各煤球廠得以盡量生產、廉價發售、實為厚幸、此事為安定市民生活起見、務請貴局盡力贊助、俾底於成、此致」</p>
<p>煤業今日集議辦法</p>
<p>自煤球業同業公會公告煤球棧單所有人限十日內出淸棧貨後、各持單人紛紛向各煤球廠出貨、惟各煤球廠竟推三阻四、以致持單人無法出貨、曾於前日推派代表、向煤業同業公會、請轉商煤球業同業公會、知照各廠商如約交貨、當經變方決定、為鄭重計、待開會從長討論、茲悉煤業同業公會已定於今日下午三時、在天津路會所召開臨時執監委員聯席會議、聞屆時除商討上項問題外、並將討論滬市整偭燃料穩定辦法、</p>
<p>廿五煤球廠生產量</p>
<p>上海市機製煤球業同業公會、自開始調查各廠於平價期內生產數量後、茲據新聲社記者探錄其二月二十五日產量如下、（一）義泰興三四一噸又四〇、（二）南洋一廠一一七噸又三〇、（三）南洋二廠一八九噸、（四）國華一六一噸又六二五、（五）東方一三五噸又五〇、（六）精華五九噸又二六、（七）光華五八噸又一二五、（八）越東、二七噸又五〇、（九）源華一二噸、（十）北洋一四噸又六七五、（十一）胡立成一五噸、（十二）華成萃記一五噸又五〇、（十三）南華三噸、（十四）和濟暫停、（十五）南方昌記一六噸又七二五、（十六）公用一〇噸、（十七）公平一噸又四〇、（十八）炎炎三噸、（十九）五福暫停、（二十）新平安記二噸又五、合計一一八一噸又五一、越東二十二日起至二四日止、共八五噸、炎炎九噸</p>

<h3>組織酒行市塲　酒業堅決反對　菸酒本有特稅雖無統制之名早有統制之實何必再設市塲</h3>
<p>上海市粱燒酒行業同業公會四十三家至體同業會員、為反對謀組酒行市塲、特於前日下午三時、在南京路一樂犬梁燒酒行茶會市塲、召開臨時同業會議、討論應付辦法、</p>
<p>拒絕參加該市塲、並督促同業會員嚴密注意、該會為鄭重計、特繕發「全體同業反對謀組酒行市塲希圖統制之公吿」、茲探錄如下、「逕啟者、現有某某等、假刻類似酒行業之脾號、蓋章於空白呈文紙上、持赴各行、謂欲呈請組織酒市塲、</p>

<p>上海郵政管理局及所屬各支局全體甲乙級郵務員、戰後會奉命八折支薪、迄已三載有餘、惟目前　市物價猛漲、生活不易、曾於月前全體郵員聯名函請郵務工會、要求轉電交通部部長張公權、准予恢復原薪、俾維低微生活、茲據新聲社記者探悉、張氏為體恤郵員生活、業已電復到滬、准予酌加津貼、惟數目多寡、滬郵局長乍配林尙未正式發表、</p>

<h3>義國在滬購地　建義僑中心區　其中將有敎堂醫院學校有華麗總會供社交活動</h3>
<p>字林報云、義國政府向工部局購得滬西地皮一方後、本市義僑、將有自己的敎堂·醫院·學校·與總會、預料此等新建築物將於二個月後、在所購地皮上開始興工建造、查該地皮在大西路·地豐路·與靜安寺路之間相對宏恩醫院、</p>
<p>呈三角形</p>
<p>計二五畝二〇一、係義國駐滬總領　尼隆代表義政府與工部局磋商叩購下者、地契將於本週初過戶、但工部局在該地皮上建有小屋數幢、將繼續佔用至三月底為止、然後該地交予義方、而將成上海義僑之新「中心地」、按僑滬義人除義國總會外、並無專供己用之</p>
<p>學校醫院</p>
<p>與敎堂等房屋、義當局對此種需要、加以考慮者、已非一日、今旣獲新地皮則將大興土木、昨（二十五日）、據尼隆吿記者稱、為便利起見、新建築物均將造於一起、無疑的本市義橋、將認新建築物為其</p>
<p>一切活動</p>
<p>之中心地、　義僑有此需要、故義政府購此地皮、按目下上海義僑均赴本市各敎堂參加禮拜、遇特殊日期、則赴消滬義　上參加彌撒、惟新建築物落成時、義僑將有自己的敎堂與醫院等、而學校竣工時、即可滿足義僑之最大需要、蓋本市今無義國學校、</p>
<p>義僑子女</p>
<p>均入各外國學校求學也、至於社交中心地、則新房屋中將建華麗之義國總會、惟該地皮之售　、迄未宣佈、英文大美晚報云、工部局總辦兼總裁費利浦今日（二十六日）吿記者稱、現已售予義國政府之宏恩醫院對面地皮、所以未公開拍賣者、乃因工部局不擬任該地被用作</p>
<p>商業發展</p>
<p>之故、工部局實有保持該地供將來發展之意、惟義政府要求購買、其價認為合乎情理、且用以建造義僑中心地、於義僑有益、而具公共價値、故工部局允許出售、渠今不願披露售價、惟地契過戶簽字時、局力將發文吿宣佈、</p>

<h3>糧食　洋米造謠失敗　價已大跌</h3>
<p>昨日米市跌風又熾、因法領公告安南提督聲明、海防米穀封境之說、令屬造謠、投機見計難售、頗為心慌、亦有將手貨猛甩求脫、計跌達一元之巨、考晨間初開、一般客販喊聲雖無增高之勢、然扳持極力、不肯輕脫、及後囤戶大事回籠、一味猛甩、乃客販亦不得相隨跟落、於是你甩吾跌、愈弄愈頺、一路直瀉、若一號西貢初開四十七元三角已削半元外、及收盤祇四十六元、火紋自初開四十五元六角跌至四十四元　角、其他各貨除混合碎以棧底較薄略為拷住、小去一元左右、為四十四元半、四十四元、餘則較前市悉降達二元有奇、且如東京　尖午市雖低至四十元零五角、尙乏成交、糯米際此環境底盤雖小、並難立足、亦降一元半光景、金壇貨售四十一元、丹陽貨高自四十元零五角次至三十九元、厚粳薄稻早晚稻無一不小、聞暗盤做開旣稀、售盤亦落近二元之砠、崑錫粳已祇四十七八元、次祇四十五六元、特薄稻四十六元、早晚稻四十四五元、且市面屢疲、貨主急於脫手、由虹口轉出達界內者尙夥、不下五千餘包、</p>

<h3>粉市暗堅　麥市轉定</h3>
<p>昨日粉市暗堅、查二號粉廠盤仍為十元、福阜兩廠限定維持本街每天七千五百包外、不願稍事多售、聞阜豐廠有一部份機件損壞、正待修理、故出粉有减無增、昨日內地及客帮需要較活、同　貨因環境良好售價復挺、聞老車牌棧單開過十四元七角半、綠礮車喊價仍須十六元、但未正式成交、市上米店門售四號粉九元三角、</p>

<p>證券暗盤、昨日市况頓轉淸閒、各戶大都觀望、局勢因空頭略有抵補、續好一二角、消息沉悶、人氣靜默、但多方因鑒於補空關係、乘機峪有加碼、市氣比較為堅、環境無變化、或將趨於盤旋之途、因一般大戶多數移其資金做棉紗套利、聞可得月息三分以上、公債市况乃趨於冷淡、即以昨日經過兩市、交易極為有限、集會人數亦見稀少、祇乙內兩種稍有交易、餘則極少顧問、結果續升一角半至二角半、成交總數不過三十餘萬、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交中華書局股五十股、價爲三十元零五角、比前又漲五角云、</p>
<p>昨日衆業公所股市、復見往常星期一之堅昂趨勢、所有向被重視之股、俱吿上游、會德豐股漲後、因獲利了結而跌、終又回至一百十元、怡和紗廠股上漲頗勁、一度抵達四十三元高峯、收盤四十二元二五成交、因生橡皮之價又落、橡皮股需求不股、價格則仍穩定、</p>
<p>本報連日又接有讀者對於洋股來函多件、見仁見智、各有不同、但本報立塲、從不願為左右袒、故心危·心安·兩君文字、不論其用心何在、採取其理由、　其太　、而使讀者明辨其是非、　律發表、正為公允起見、目素來反對投機、故不欲叫人投機、亦不欲示人以投機之方、啟人以投機之心、至於隔靴搔癢之作、更所不取、蓋惟有自己不作投機想、而後宅心司公正也、故希望非有眞知灼見、幸弗浪費筆墨、作投機觀、再衆業公所股市消息、係由該所發表、自以該所利益為前提、故其立言亦希注意、</p>

<p>紗市稍形回平、但實需華南及內地一帶、漸露發展氣象、惟二月期貨因月末將届、一般獲利者活動了結、以致檯面稍鬆、同時外匯雖堅定、而無大變遷、黃金略為疲弱、人心平庸、市象稍帶疲軟、但原棉情况極其挺秀、廠方成本難有　望也、</p>
<p>現紗晨開市情安靜、同時外匯依然堅固二十支　馬開價為八百六十四元、三月期價八白八十三元、少頃因獲利者及套利戶增加、市况轉趨疲弱、市盤稍見下降、三月期跌八百七十五元、二月份價為八百五十八元、但跌至此價大戶復來收進而轉趨站定、查半日間成交統計二千三百二十五包、行情二十支雙馬疲短五元半、昨有紗四百十五件運暹邏、十六件運查港、一百六十件運厦門、八十五件運天津、茲將各帮口買去之額如左、</p>

<p>另訊外棉市價、紐約棉市、晨初開盤、殊爲堅定、先因投機者之購買、後又因同業及海外棉商之購買及一部份之空頭抵補而漲、結果收盤價格、較之上日漲起五六磅音至十餘磅音不等、印度連同預測又漲二羅比餘、埃及漲五六磅音、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、日來人心頗為良好、惟以月底將届、各方銀根較緊、故交易稍見淸淡、廠方則始終抱觀望態度、棉市之活躍、祇賴於同業矣、茲將昨日棉市以美爾六元八一二五折合送廠價如下、</p>
<h3>油市　豆油回升元許　生油銷呆續跌</h3>
<p>昨日豆油市况、在晨盤因賣買雙方之意思平凡、致市少生色、入後吐納接近、交易開展、市呈熱鬧、但其範圍狹隘、操縱無機可乘、人心尙少興奮、故行情比上週末略緊元譜、統計做開大連原油一百五十桶、價為一百十五元至一百十六元、漢口油二十桶、價為一百十四元、蚌埠油十二桶、價為一百十三元五角、大有廠油一百擔、價為九十一元、及浦東長德廠油五十擔、（日商營業）價為八十八元五角、花生油因香港帮不動、市價繼跌、祇交易靑島油五十桶、價為一百十五元云、</p>

<h3>疋頭　棉布春銷又動</h3>
<p>布市淺色細紗綫織品走勢頗佳、市盤堅挺、蓋因春銷發動、惟本色坯布因漂染廠抬高整理費後、成本增加、已較市上熟貨為昂、故需胃漸顯淡薄、售價欲漲無力、怡和粗布廠盤續升、十六磅組布市上出品漸稀、各牌每疋漲二角半之譜、細布·斜紋散戶手貨稍鬆、乃係月底墊款及銀根緊急關係、本街交易最盛、客銷以溫州·粵·港·皖北及南洋帮較旺、綜計一千餘件、</p>

<h3>南北貨　黑瓜子步緊</h3>
<p>黑瓜子因到存單薄、自紅　以來、逐步上展、查統市存底、惟大連子為數較多、約有十車之譜、其餘均僅零星　已、而大連子產價迭漲、合劃申市、竟差十餘元、故後批決難再來、因此格外堅緊、昨行盤濟魁子七十元、徐魁子六十七元至六十五元、桐城子六十五元、明光子六十元、大連子五十八元、</p>
<h3>五金　盤元需要清淡</h3>
<p>新盤元交易、素以本街製釘廠為最盛（蓋係本釘原料、）唯最近以來、因本釘銷路减弱、製釘廠工作淸閑致對新盤元採辦亦减、市况　滯人心變軟、行情减低二元、刻市每担沾四十九元左右、昨市成交僅一百七八十担而已、外埠僅烟台帮略有點綴、</p>

<p>小談</p>
<h3>挨餓自由</h3>
<p>— 嘉</p>
<p>那天有一位漂泊無依的俄國女人，順為肚飢難熱，異想天開，跑到法租界巡捕房法，要求入獄。捕房裏的人因她並未犯罪，拒絕所請。她沒法子，說自己是吸海洛英的煙犯。捕房的人不信，把她趕走。她祇好失望而去。</p>
<p>她因為食與住的問題未解決，便想出了一個妙策，選出一家麵包舖，把大玻璃打破了。結果終於達到了目的。欣然微笑入獄。</p>
<p>從另一個社會看業，這是一件小小的幽默而悲哀的事實。續者看到這一段社會新聞的時候，一定眼中含着淚，而嘴邊露着一絲肢心的微笑的。</p>
<p>這個俄國女人被捕以後，不知審判官要判她甚麼罪，處她以甚麼刑罰。罰款嗎？那當然等於緣木求；監禁吧？那在她看來等於解瘊了膳宿問題，正是她所求之不得的。在這種案件上，法律是等於虛文而已。</p>
<p>在這裏，現社會露了　個掩飾不了的大破綻。</p>
<p>「不自由，母寗死！」這一句名言在這裏似乎是不適用的了。其實這名話本身並沒有甚麼毛病，那個請求入獄的俄國女人並不是想用她的自由去換得一飽，她是在逃避着另外一種自由，一種可怕的自由——就是現社會所賜給她的「挨餓自由」啊！</p>

<h3>美國學生的反戰運動</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>在戰爭日益迫近的今日，各國當局於積極備戰之餘，都從事加緊全國靑年的軍事訓練。但各國當局儘管熱心的努力着戰爭的凖備，而一般學生的非戰心理，却是日益成長着，尤以美國大學生為最甚，他們甚至把厭惡戰爭的心理擴展而為大規模的行動了。</p>
<p>據最近的調查，一年中美國監獄裏被拘囚的靑年，多半是為了參加反戰的示威運動，而山於個人品行不端的反較少。</p>
<p>在美國，根據六十五所大學亞非二萬二千六百多名學生的投票，有八千九百三十八票，表示絕對拒絕參與任何的國際戰爭；七千三百多票表示只有為了衛護美國的領土，他們願意戰爭；祗有極少數的願意無條件服從國家動員令。講到學生反戰的動機也許是由於宗敎的信仰，或是由於對國際聯盟的前護，但是支配這反戰因素的情縣團級，似乎還是由於「對戰爭的懷疑」罷。拿過去幾年美國各大學的反戰刋物或傳單來看，便足證明。他們大都具着同樣的猜疑：戰爭是老年人爭取利益的競賽，年靑人不過被當作衝陷陣的小卒。他們也最恨侵略者，對於弱小者也是很同情的。</p>
<p>在美國學生的刋物上，時常有各種反戰的文字，大聲疾呼，言詞警闢，以圖喚起全國學生的反戰觀念。便如：「不必再懷疑了：軍火商人跟工業和經濟的利益已凖備再來一次慘酷的決戰，以決定誰來統治世界的市塲……同學們，我們對於這種陰謀的回答是什麼呢？我們如果有決心，我們能夠阻止戰爭。我們應及早努力。他們還製了無數的旗織，大書着！」「取消R.O.T.C！」（後備軍官練營）拒絕與政府合作參加任何戰爭！」</p>
<p>至於美國學生的反戰運動，現在已推廣到如何程度，這卻也難說。就過去幾年的情形看秋，廣義地說，這種情緒在美國東部為最強固的大本營常在都市心的學校中。到現在為止，美國學生的反戰組織，已有下列各種：</p>
<p>（一）實業民主學生盟（二）全國學生盟。這兩者的目標除『反戰』外，還反對對黑人學生的不平等待遇，以及其也敎育上的問題。前者成立較早，現在在各大學中有分部百餘處，並發行月刋一種，名叫「學生展望」。後者成立已有八年，發行月刋一種，名叫「學生評論」（三）美國反戰反法西斯聯盟，這個組織跟上面二個合成為美國大學中和平運動的左翼。發行月刋一種，名曰「戰鬬」。（四）綠色國際，這是一種國際的學生組織，會員都着綠衣衫，在美國務團還不大，但在「威士康辛」，「巴黎」，「帝國」，「牛津」等大學中，都有分部，主要的目標就是反對侵略的武裝。</p>

<h3>科學預言</h3>
<p>— 芝蕙</p>
<p>愛迭生的預言</p>
<p>距今三十二年前，美國大科學家愛迭生，在紐約時報上答覆該報記者不少的問題。那些答案在當時就成為極可珍貴的未來世界的預言。</p>
<p>他的預言當然完全是關於科學上的。那是：</p>
<p>一，鋼骨水泥建築物黃金時期。</p>
<p>二，有聲對白影片的發明。</p>
<p>三，鐵道電氣化。</p>
<p>四，電解窒素肥料的發明。</p>
<p>五，利用水磨憲的發達。</p>
<p>六，航空事業，特別是郵航事業的成功。</p>
<p>七，血清在人類健康上發現了意外的效用，要使生命延長。</p>
<p>八，常常在發現和自然力的方法，故常有從未過的新事物出現。</p>
<p>九，煤的用管途大大地增廣。</p>
<p>上面是一九〇八年紐約時報上的有越的記載，在今日看來，愛失生偉大的預言幾乎大半皆應騐了，其中一，二，三，三，六，九，各項都是當然的事實；四，七，項也距離完成之期不遠了；至於第八項，和自然而新法明的事物更數不盡，舉一件最普通的，　虹燈不是利用自然作用最奇妙的一件事物嗎？</p>
<p>今後的預言</p>
<p>偉大的愛迭生早已離開了</p>
<p>人羣，故今後三十年科學進步的情形將怎樣？有迭決不能再告訴我們。如今且聽聽美國耶魯大學一位法那斯（C.C.Farnese）敎援的預言：</p>
<p>一，立體式建築物將增加。</p>
<p>二，住宅換氣設備之普及（如暖氣與冷氣）。</p>
<p>三，無綫電傳影（又名電視）之用途增大。</p>
<p>四，農產品在工業上利用的方法增多。</p>
<p>五，因某種新織維之發明而使紡織經業大為改觀。</p>
<p>六，輕金屬（如鋁，鎳）用途無限地擴展。</p>
<p>七，萬能藥的發明。</p>
<p>八，食物生產的調整，即凡對人體最有益的使其大量出產，次要的生產額減少。</p>
<p>九，人類生活科學的進步與生命的廷長。</p>
<p>十，可塑原料（如金屬）用途的增廣。</p>
<p>上面的十項預測，倘使能夠一一實現，那末三十年後我們的世界，的確文要另換一番觀感了。</p>

<h3>培養生活的興趣</h3>
<p>— 楊同芳</p>
<p>中國人往往不善利用休閒生活，缺乏助長身心發展的業餘興趣：尤其是一般職業靑年，他們在工作之暇，因為找不着適宜的消遣，於是感到生活的枯燥和空虛。至於那些不甘「無聯　的人們，便去追求高度的聲與色的刺激，把有用的時間，消磨在影響健康的不良嗜好裏，這該是多麼可惜的事。</p>
<p>照心理學家的研究，一個人如果不能把他剩餘的精力，向適當的方面發洩，那麼他的身心就不會有健全的發展了。休閒生活的利用和業餘與趣的培養，旣可使我們的生活得到適當的調劑，不復再大感到枯燥和空虛；同時又能增進我們對於生活的信仰，使生活的意義更加豐富，生活的經騐更加擴大。許多發明家藝術家的成就，都由善於利用餘暇而培養的懷趣所致，當然不是沒有原故的。</p>
<p>因此，這裏所說的生活的興趣，是很廣泛的，舉凡職業以外的有益於身心的，興趣工作都應包括在內。像一切文藝，繪畫，音樂，彫刻，旅行，運動等，我們都可各就性之所近，多多地培養這些興趣。這此興趣的價値，應該速在普通的消遣以上，牠足以啟迪人格，薰陶德性。到了我們感覺得這些興趣，和生活不能分離的時候，也就會深切地知道利用休閒時間培養生活的興趣是怎樣的重要。</p>
<p>西洋人體格的健康，精神的活潑，充分地表現出他們對於業餘興趣的愛好。旅行，游泳，划船，溜冰，他們都隨時去參加，視為生活不可缺少的興趣。即就閱讀書報雜誌而言，中國人寗可丢棄這種可貴的精神食粳，消磨時間和精力於賭博，這是忽視生活的興趣的明例。</p>
<p>我希望消度在萎靡浮　的無聊消遣中的人們，能夠及早猛醒，尋找有意義有價値的生活的興趣！</p>
<h3>「包裹」</h3>
<p>— 黎離</p>
<p>提起人生大家都會記起走路，這是一個頂熱悉的比方。但，邁開步子有人記住在走，有人卻忘掉在走。</p>
<p>請問，茫旅程你要走到那兒去呢？東？西？南？北？不經意的一問也夠你迷惘一陣了。</p>
<p>人生的大道並不是柏油馬路。你不能閒蕩，瞎逛。你應該收拾起行裝，背好希望的包裹，追趕你的路程。</p>
<p>沉甸甸的小包裹壓在你的背上警惕着你，督促着你。於是，你再不會迷失了方向，更不會賬惘於無有歸突了。</p>
<p>記着，要槍一個沉甸甸的包裹，不要挑輕　　的。但，你的包裹在那兒呢？</p>

<h3>從塞外歸來　蒙古攝影回憶錄（下）</h3>
<p>— 姚士泉（重慶航訊）</p>
<p>這時「喇聖廟」已有許多位大小喇嘛在迎接，到處懸掛了白紙糊的大燈籠。在道夜色茫茫的沙漠里，見到了這種異樣景色，幾疑到了另個世界，打　打鼓，聲勢喧天。衛士林立，威風八面。把我們擁入廟裏，大家盤膝坐在絲絨毯子墊着的大坑上，牆上四面燃着酥油燈。坑的正中設一長條的坐位像宮殿上的寶座一樣。衛組長和康王坐在正中，我們多人分坐兩旁。空氣極度莊嚴，康王特備了蒙古化的晚餐招待我們，餐具是古型的銅器，四週牆上畫了多幅古典的壁畫，紅柱綠瓦，金碧雕鏤，處處表現着富麗堂皇。古色古香的情調，我們像到了另一個美的世界上去了……</p>
<p>一早醒來，紅日已照滿了蒙占圖案化的窗格上了。幾個紅衣喇嘛，手提一個黃銅壺和幾個小銅盆進來。我們起初不知道牠有什麼用處，後來那個會說漢語的老喇嘛吿訴我們才知道是洗面像具。平餐是奶油泡炒米，奶汕是五十磅汕煉出的一磅。這秤名貴奶油是為了王爺特製的。上午康王命令發了警　，四面的蒙古壯丁，騎兵，自衛團，很迅速地集合在「喇聖廟」前。康王開始檢閱，幾天的攝影工作很圓滿地完成了。晚上，康王召集在大蒙古包一裏開了個盛大的夜會。全體合唱國歌後，娛樂節目開始了。蒙古女同志合唱抗戰殺敵歌，及各種蒙古民歌，最後大家合唱義勇軍進行曲。酒過三巡，吃罷全羊，康王有慷慨激烈的演說：痛斥日本帝國主義的陰謀和殘酷，希望全國各民族不受敵人利用。精誠團結，在蔣委員長領導下，完成抗戰建國的偉業。並憶述過去滿淸政府毒化蒙古政策的陰謀，所以他積極主張廢除喇嘛制度。四十歲以下的一律還俗去當壯丁，並廢止王公制度，禁止頂戴服制，及一切跪拜禮節等……最後康王對我們微笑的說：「請各位不要把進封建的稱呼叫我康王了，我是國民政府委任的「達拉特旗」的抗日軍司令呵……。</p>
<p>當我踏上靑海的征途時，腦海裏的回憶，使人永遠遺忘不掉蒙古地的攝影呵！</p>
<h3>金殿喋血記</h3>
<p>— 企華</p>
<p>處理歷史戲，尤其是像一金殿喋血記一這樣故事複雜的歷史戲，不是經過適當的剪裁，縝密的編製，往往顧此失彼，或者祇是贅累地介紹故事。「金殿喋血記」的導演，雖然用了李却搬移一個個接近王位寳座的木偶來開展他的弒兄抗姪，陰謀篡位的殘酷的手段，但是這取巧的手法，還是不能掩飾編製上的缺憾，使許多重要的戲都不能充份發展，而變成了過塲戲，這是非常可惜的。至於個別的戲，如李却慫慂愛德華下約翰於獄；李却的奪取安妮；及謀害克拉倫司等，都處理得很好。</p>
<p>貝錫爾賴斯朋的李却，他的面部已經佔上了飾演這角色的便宜，而他的邋用眼睛，更獲得了成功。譬如上述的三個例子，下約翰於獄中的時候，他昂着頭，眼睛忽張忽合，奪取安妮懇愛德華赦免時，他的眼珠閃動盤旋；與克拉倫司飲酒時，他眼珠木然不動，這些眼睛的動作，都幫助刻劃了李却的陰險奸詐。其他飾愛德華四世，克拉倫司，伊麗莎白的都整齊。卡洛夫除了利用他面部的化裝外，他沒有描繪出穆特這帮手的兇惡。</p>
<p>兩塲戰爭，織剪緊湊。國產電影的戰爭塲面往往不知所之，尤共是用使古代兵器，這裏該是很好的範本。</p>

<p>十餘年前南方坤伶多萃集在法大馬路老共舞臺，其時「宏碧緣」本戲正風靡一時，某坤伶任劇中主角駱宏勛，扮像漂亮，唱法新頴，最擅大段流水板，彼雖係女伶，但嗓音則寬放渾厚，復時以柔媚之昔取悅觀衆，故一時觀者莫不嘖嘖稱道。百代公司，曾經灌過她幾張唱片，數年間風行全國，據說該公司中無論甚麽名伶的唱片都沒有某坤伶的那幾張片子銷路廣，獲利多，後來美商勝利公司設廠於上海，接到南北各分行的報吿，都說某坤伶的唱片銷塲大，公司裏的西人當然以營業為重，就專心一意要約請某坤伶灌音，但是那時她已謝絕歌壇將近十年之久，又與外間不常交往，後來還是打聽她的老琴師，才知道她近來處境的困難，倘使公司裏能出相常的代價，她也可以同她所天商議，一則藉此多留點紀念，二來還可以得到數千元的收入，也於虧空巳久的家庭，多少能獲得相當的補助。這事經過兩次接洽之後，就算定議，惟時値盛暑天氣，（照例灌音以春季最佳，秋季次之，夏冬二季，向不灌音，惟該公司以新廠落成，急欲試騐機器之良窳，及新工程師之技術若伺，故始冒然為之）灌音室中，揮汗如雨，以致每灌一片，恒須重灌數次，最後方能選中蠟盤一對，一日祗灌得「斬子」頭段，而時間巳晏，約定翌日早臨，再接灌二三四諸段。殊不知次日天氣更熱，工程師等在灌音室中自下午一時直候至三時許，而某坤伶猶未駕臨，外人習慣，最重信用，登時面上就現出不愉之色，同時並預備把機器及蠟盤收起不再灌了。（一八六）</p>

<h3>Military Affairs Commission Announces Weekly War Situation (Continued) February 17th to 23rd</h3>

<p>After we recaptured Dongshan Island, several thousand Japanese and puppet troops landed near Gangwei on the 17th, attempting to invade Chengpu. After being surrounded and attacked by our troops on all sides, they were confined to the seaside without any progress. On the 19th and 20th, more than 3,000 puppet troops, with more than 2,700 guns, led by Regiment Commander Hu Laipu, Chen An□, Zhang Zhenglou, etc., defected and fought against the Japanese in the Dahu Mountain and Gangwei area. Our main force took the opportunity to directly attack their core positions. In recent days, more than a thousand enemies have been killed, and the remaining Japanese forces have been disintegrating. The Japanese attempt to invade Fujian has suffered a fatal blow.</p>
<p>Northern Hubei</p>
<p>Since the 18th, our army has launched a campaign to wipe out the Japanese troops entrenched in the strongholds northeast of the Dahong Mountains. After recovering Pingba, an important stronghold between Anzhong, Anjing, and Xiangyang, they took advantage of the victory to besiege Yujiadian and Luoyangdian. On the 19th, they continued to capture Dushan and Maping, and unexpectedly recovered Pinglin. Another unit of our army launched a fierce attack on Suixian, forcing it to the outskirts of the city. After suffering heavy losses, the Japanese were on the verge of collapse and were attempting to break out and escape.</p>
<p>Shandong Province</p>
<p>The Japanese troops harassing Wendeng and Rongcheng have not yet discovered the location of our main force, and have been trapped in the complex mountain valleys in that area. The Japanese forces are exhausted. Their independent mixed brigade commander, Akiyama Seitaro, was seriously injured and killed in the battle of Zhuwangzhuang.

<h3>Weng Wenhao Discusses Economic Resistance</h3>
<p>Chongqing – Minister of Economic Affairs Weng Wenhao gave a radio address here last night, mainly stating that the anti-Japanese war in the future must be carried out in two aspects: (1) increasing China's production, and (2) strengthening the blockade of the Japanese economy. Weng stated that the most important thing for China at present is to increase the production of military supplies, ammunition, grain, clothing, and other materials needed by the soldiers on the front lines. On the other hand, because China's heavy industry has not established a foundation in the past, China must increase the export of tea, silk, tung oil, bristles, wool, minerals, and other products in order to obtain foreign exchange to purchase military supplies and other raw materials. On the other hand, it is necessary to increase the manufacture of daily necessities in order to stabilize prices in the rear. At the same time, people should also be accustomed to diligence and thrift. All three of these are intended to increase production. In addition to this, the economic blockade of Japan should be strengthened. All goods produced by Japan and its colonies, as well as factories outside the Japanese mainland, and goods seized by the Japanese, are subject to boycott and rejection. Finally, the Chinese should stop supplying raw materials to Japan. Farmers and young people near the Japanese defense lines must refuse to work for the Japanese. (25th United Press Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Government Actively Developing Xinjiang's Rich Resources</h3>
<p>Chongqing – Xinjiang and the mainland of China are now connected by new air routes and highways. The central government is now taking strong action to develop the natural resources of this province, which was once almost a forbidden area, and has already invested 750,000 yuan in a certain gold mine in Xinjiang. The mine currently produces 15,000 ounces of gold per year. It is reported that Xinjiang previously only produced 20,000 tons of coal per year, but the central government has already invested 300,000 yuan to develop the coalfields west of Turpan and Kashgar in the province. Xinjiang's true future lies in agriculture and animal husbandry. Therefore, the central government has spent 40 million yuan to establish model agricultural stations. In the field of animal husbandry alone, the government's investment has exceeded 20 million yuan. The Xinjiang Provincial Government spent approximately 500,000 yuan on irrigation and water conservancy projects last year, and will allocate another 500,000 yuan this year. Seven years ago, only 2,000 people in the province had received elementary education. But today, due to the implementation of group education, 200,000 men and women have received education at all levels, and the province's education and culture budget has now increased to more than 4 million yuan per year.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Unfolding of the Struggle for Neutral Countries</h3>
<p>Although the European war is currently superficially in a state of semi-pause, the two sides' struggle to win over neutral countries as allies is extremely active in secret. In this European war, Northern Europe has neutral countries such as Sweden, Norway, and Denmark, Western Europe has two neutral countries, the Netherlands and Belgium, and Central Europe and the Balkans have neutral countries such as Romania, Yugoslavia, Greece, Hungary, and Turkey. Regardless of whether these countries nominally maintain neutrality, but are actually more inclined to one side and estranged from the other; regardless of whether both sides of the belligerent countries declare that they will not violate the security of the neutral countries and respect their independence; when the war expands, the belligerent countries will probably only consider the situation of these small countries from a military, diplomatic, and strategic point of view, and will never lightly relax their grip because of their neutral legal principles or their unwillingness to join the war. The lessons of the last war have already proven that so-called neutrality only becomes an initial wish, and is not an unbreakable barrier. Germany's use of Belgium as a transit route in 1914, destroying Belgium's neutrality, is one of the most famous events. However, similar things have also happened on the other side. In 1915, the Allied forces landed in Thessaloniki and occupied Saloniki, as a base for the Allied forces to attack the Macedonian front; and aided Venizelos, overthrowing the Greek government that was unwilling to fight at that time, and Venizelos formed a government and joined the Allied forces in the war. From this, it can be seen that threats and inducements were used to the extreme, which had already created a prominent precedent in the last war. Since the outbreak of this war until today, the time has been short, and the war on the Western Front is not like the last war, where both sides, at the beginning, used rapid steps to seek a quick victory, so events that destroy the neutrality of countries have not been discovered so far. However, the fact that neutral countries' ships have been sunk by German submarines, and that belligerent countries' airplanes have invaded the borders of neutral countries, has been seen repeatedly. Although the neutral countries have protested, the belligerent countries often ignore them in eight or nine out of ten cases; at most, they express apologies, but never guarantee the future. Recently, the British warship's search of the German Altmark, with both forces acting within the territorial waters of a neutral country, Norway, although seriously protested; but the result is probably not that both sides will respect Norway's territorial waters from now on! Viewing Britain's response to Norway's protest, "not wanting to give a reply for the time being," is clear evidence. As the war develops, similar events are bound to become more and more numerous, and their relationship is bound to become more and more important. Beginning with inducement, followed by threats, and finally falling on one side and engaging in armed conflict with the other. From Northern Europe to the Balkans, these countries are still in a state of peace, but this kind of peace can only be regarded as superficial, temporary, and easily broken, because it has no strong guarantee whatsoever. The Netherlands and Belgium in Western Europe, in terms of strength, are not enemies of Germany, and in terms of situation, are between two great powers. Fortunately, these two countries have no territorial disputes in the past, and their relations have always been friendly, and they will not be used by other countries to fight each other. The three Nordic countries, Sweden, Norway, and Denmark, are countries of the same race and language, with consistent interests and the same view of peace-loving. If there is an external crisis, the three countries will consult each other and deal with it together, so in their essence and subjectively, they must be like the Netherlands and Belgium, and will not be used by third countries, and have any biased actions. As for the Balkan countries, called neutral, the most complex in terms of ethnicity, the most burdensome in terms of disputes, and also the focus of attention for ambitious international adventurers. After the last war, this area became the battleground for the Versailles system versus the anti-Versailles system, and the grand stage for countries maintaining the status quo versus countries overthrowing the status quo. On the eve of the Second World War, due to the expansion of the National Socialist Party's power and the rapid advance of the eastward policy, the struggle between countries in the Balkans became more and more acute. Britain and France then provided guarantees for the integrity of Greece, Turkey, and Romania, and these three countries were happy to accept the guarantees. Now Romania seems to be showing some signs of wavering, but Greece, Turkey, and Romania will not participate in the war, but if they do, they must be allies of Britain and France. Not only that, but also because the Western Front is quiet, Britain and France currently do not want to break through Germany from the eastern border of France; but because Greece is in the hands of Britain and France, Turkey is closely linked with Britain and France, and Britain and France have stationed heavy troops in the Near East, their intentions can be imagined. Calling it a defense against the southward advance of the Soviet Union is actually unreasonable, because before the Soviet Union conquered Finland, how could the Soviet Union have any reason to advance southward? And Britain and France have repeatedly declared that the Soviet Union has stationed heavy troops in the Caucasus, and declared that Turkey has already mobilized. The trend that this reveals to us is: the development of the war in the future may not be on the Western Front, but will probably unfold from this link and develop towards another link. Once the war is launched, it cannot be stopped, and it cannot be cleaned up as desired. It is like playing with fire, the more you play with it, the more intense it becomes. At that time, wooing neutral countries, coercing neutral countries, and destroying the neutrality of countries will inevitably be like the situation in the last war, and will no longer be considered for any other reason than military strategy!</p>
<h3>The Complete Publication of Secret Documents Regarding the Lansing-Ishii Agreement; The United States Once Suggested Publishing an Open Door Declaration, But Japan Rejected It, Citing Special Interests</h3>
<p>Washington – Secret documents regarding the negotiations between U.S. Secretary of State Lansing and Japanese Ambassador to the United States Ishii on the Chinese issue in 1917 have now been published here. The first volume is about the negotiations on the neutralization of China, which was published three days ago. But this suggestion was put forward too late and was rejected by President Wilson. The second volume was published today, which contains the Japanese Ambassador to the United States Ishii's proposal to discuss the Chinese issue with the United States. At that time, U.S. Secretary of State Lansing proposed that the United States and Japan jointly issue a declaration on the Open Door Policy. Ishii looked shocked and uneasy at Lansing's suggestion, and said that Japan has always adhered to the Open Door Policy, so it is considered unnecessary to issue this declaration, and Japan has special interests in China in terms of its position. Therefore, if only a declaration on the Open Door Policy is issued, without an accompanying statement on Japan's special interests, it will inevitably invite criticism and attacks in the country. (26th United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Washington – The U.S. Department of State published the documents of former U.S. Secretary of State Lansing yesterday. The second volume, which is also the last volume of Lansing's documents, was published this time. The documents contained in this volume mainly involve the Sino-Japanese negotiations during the previous European War, the U.S. sending troops to Siberia, and the U.S. cooperating with Britain and France in the plan and action to jointly resist Germany from April 1917 to November 1918. Lansing was the U.S. Secretary of State during the previous European War. The Lansing-Ishii Agreement, which was once the focus of world attention, was the agreement signed by Lansing on behalf of the United States and Japanese politician Ishii. (26th Haitong Dispatch)</p>
<h3>A Central Figure in Japanese Politics: Tatsuo Saitō's Brief Biography; "A Short Man with a Loud Voice"</h3>
<p>Hong Kong – Tatsuo Saitō, who has become a central figure in Japanese politics, has been referred to as "a short man with a loud voice" by some Japanese newspapers. He is a well-known member of the Minseitō party. On February 2, he gave a speech in the House of Representatives, criticizing the Konoe statement, which is considered sacred throughout the country, shocking the entire audience. His background is worth noting. It is reported that Tatsuo Saitō is 71 years old this year. He is from Kansai and is only five feet tall and weighs less than one hundred pounds. When he spoke to reporters about this incident, he was full of indignation. He likes archery and often sings Japanese songs. He gets up very early every day, browses the newspapers, and then handles daily public and private affairs. He always goes to the Japanese Club for lunch and rarely goes out after evening. Although he is old, he is still as healthy as ever and does not look like a 71-year-old. He usually wears a kimono and often takes walks in the countryside. He knows nothing about Japanese art and has no interest in it. He is never seen in the Japanese opera house. He speaks English, but still prefers to use Japanese in his daily life. He studied in the United States and worked as a lawyer after returning to China. He began his political career in 1912. In 1913, he was the representative of Japan to a certain international conference in the Netherlands. In 1919, he was the representative of a certain international conference in this capital. He has traveled all over Russia, Germany, France, Italy, Britain, and Switzerland. (26th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>The Philippines Expected to Become Independent as Scheduled; Sayre Explains Reasons</h3>
<p>Manila – U.S. High Commissioner to the Philippines Sayre stated today on the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the Manila Daily Bulletin that he believes that unless there is a drastic change in the international situation, the Philippine Independence Act will be implemented as scheduled. There are two reasons: (1) He does not believe that Americans and Filipinos will make any further changes to this act. (2) Under the current international situation, American taxpayers do not seem likely to support the proposal to build and maintain sufficient defense forces in the Philippines. Regarding the economic difficulties that should arise after the independence of the Philippine Islands, the Filipinos have already been aware of them when they accepted the Tydings–McDuffie Act. A reporter asked whether the Japanese invasion would cause the Filipinos to change their desire for independence. Sayre replied, "Of course, no one can predict what will happen in the future. The world in 1946 may be very different from the world today. What I am saying today may be completely unfounded at that time. But unless there is a major change in the world situation, the Filipinos' desire for independence is unlikely to change much." (26th United Press Dispatch)</p>

<p>Rome - Myron Taylor, President Roosevelt's personal representative to the Vatican, met with Vatican Secretary of State Cardinal Maglione at 11:30 this morning for half an hour. It is reported that it has been decided that he will meet Pope Pius XII tomorrow morning. (Havas dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>Vatican City - Myron Taylor, the personal representative of U.S. President Roosevelt to the Vatican, has arrived in Rome. The Vatican Secretary of State, Cardinal Maglione, immediately sent two representatives to pay their respects. Taylor is scheduled to meet with Cardinal Maglione tomorrow, at which time the date of his audience with the Pope may be confirmed. Observers here have said that the United States severed diplomatic relations with the Vatican in 1867. Taylor's arrival is not a formal resumption of relations, as he is only President Roosevelt's personal representative and not the formal representative of the U.S. head of state. Therefore, his mission is limited. However, the Vatican is treating him as an ambassador and recognizes his diplomatic privileges. People in the Vatican are very satisfied with Taylor's visit, which is the real situation. (Havas dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>Rome - According to well-informed Vatican sources, Pope Pius XII will receive Welles on the 28th. However, it is generally believed that Welles will visit the Pope after returning to Rome following his visits to Berlin, Paris, and London. People close to the U.S. Embassy in Italy also believe that this speculation is more accurate. (Haitong dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>Vatican City - Myron Taylor, the personal representative of U.S. President Roosevelt to the Vatican, held his first talks with Vatican Secretary of State Cardinal Maglione. According to Vatican sources, this is the first time a formal U.S. envoy has come to the Vatican since the United States severed diplomatic relations with the Vatican seventy years ago. Taylor enjoys the status of an ambassador and is a devout Catholic, so it can be said with certainty that this trip will be successful. (Havas dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>Paris - Today, all newspapers here welcomed the arrival of U.S. Under Secretary of State Welles in Europe. Commentators hope that Welles will personally witness Germany's treatment of small countries. Le Petit Parisien reported that unless Welles visits Warsaw, Prague, and Vienna after listening to Hitler and his associates, and meets with other officials, he will have an inadequate understanding of what Hitler intends to do in the region he considers his vital living space.

<h3>Atlantic Mail Plane Changes Route; No Longer Stops at Bermuda</h3>
<p>New York - Pan American Airways has announced that, effective March 15, its Atlantic route mail planes will no longer stop at Bermuda when flying to Europe.

<h3>Native Americans Abolish Swastika Symbol</h3>
<p>New York - According to news from Tucson, Arizona, Native Americans in the state have abolished the swastika as their tribal emblem due to their hatred of National Socialism. They held a solemn ceremony to burn various items bearing the swastika. Four tribal chiefs also issued a proclamation, stating, "For centuries, our ancestors have used the swastika to represent friendship. Now it has been desecrated by another nation, so we have decided to prohibit our people from using it." (Havas dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<h3>Details of Japanese Army and Navy Expansion; Diet Unable to Intervene in Funding</h3>
<p>Tokyo - Japan's military expenditure has been enormous since the outbreak of the China Incident. The expenditure for the coming year alone will exceed 6,600,000,000 yen. In addition, the Japanese Army and Navy intend to request an additional 5,950,000,000 yen this year to implement a new five-year military buildup program to continue the plan that began in 1937. If the Japanese Diet passes any program that lasts for several years, the funds required for it cannot be debated in subsequent Diets, unless the original plan is changed. This point should not be overlooked. Of the 5,950,000,000 yen requested by the Army and Navy, 3,621,000,000 yen is for the Army. The Army intends to use 1,190,000,000 yen to expand its garrison organization, while the Navy needs 2,329,000,000 yen, of which 1,105,000,000 yen will be used to build new warships.</p>
<p>Details of the Army Program are as follows:</p>
<p>The consolidation of foundations and buildings from 1922 will be completed in the 1941-42 fiscal year, with a total cost of 47,000,000 yen. The renovation of barracks and other buildings will be completed in 1944-45, with a total cost of 27,400,000 yen.</p>
<p>Details of the Navy Program are as follows:</p>
<p>Warship repairs will be completed in 1944-45. The annual cost from 1940-41 will be 58,000,000 yen. Special repairs for warships are scheduled to be completed in 1941-42. The cost for 1940-41 is 13,889,000 yen, and for 1941-42 is 9,920,000 yen. The installation of new electrical gun emplacements in submarines is scheduled to be completed in two years. The cost for 1940-41 is 17,000,000 yen, and for 1941-42 is 850,000 yen. Replenishment of military supplies is scheduled to be completed in 1944-45. The cost after 1940-41 will be 23,800,000 yen. Construction of tidal observation stations along major sea routes is scheduled to begin in 1940-41 and be completed in 1942-43, with a total cost of 53,550,000 yen. Research expenses for barges, engines, and munitions will be 59,500,000 yen in 1940-41 and 29,750,000 yen in 1941-42. Replenishment of military supplies will be completed in 1951-52. The cost after 1940-41 will be 11,900,000 yen. (Reuters dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<h3>U.S. Loan to China Displeases Japan</h3>
<p>Tokyo - Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman Suma said today that Japan considers the U.S. plan to lend China $20 million a serious matter, as the loan, although not for military use, will at least greatly enhance General Chiang Kai-shek's political position.

<h3>Meeting of Foreign Ministers of Three Nordic Countries; Decide to Maintain Strict Neutrality; Hope for Peaceful Resolution of Soviet-Finnish War; Seriously Protest Anglo-German Naval Warfare Methods</h3>
<p>Copenhagen - The foreign ministers of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden recently held a meeting here to review the international situation. Afterwards, a public statement was issued stating that the results of the meeting have been telegraphed to the foreign minister of Finland and the prime minister of Iceland for their information. (Note: Iceland and Denmark are in a personal union). At this meeting, the foreign ministers of the three Scandinavian countries expressed their hope that the war between Finland and the Soviet Union could be resolved peacefully, allowing Finland to maintain complete independence and sovereignty; this is the first point. The three foreign ministers reiterated their neutral policy, denying that their current attitude is due to pressure from any party, and declared that in their foreign relations, they have decided to pursue an independent, autonomous, impartial policy. At the same time, they also decided to demand that the belligerent countries respect the territories and territorial waters of neutral countries in accordance with international law; this is the second point. The neutral countries are eager to maintain necessary and legitimate overseas trade, but current naval warfare has caused significant losses to these countries. The three foreign ministers have decided to lodge a serious protest and seek remedies for naval warfare methods that violate the principles of international law. In this regard, the three governments will support each other when negotiating with the belligerent countries; this is the third point. The three foreign ministers believe that if the current European war is not ended early, it will inevitably lead to greater disasters. Not only will the mutual relations between countries worsen, but it will also be more difficult to find a lasting solution. For this reason, any effort that can promote negotiations between the belligerent countries to establish a fair and lasting peace is welcomed by the three countries; this is the fourth point. (Havas dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>Copenhagen - The public statement issued after the meeting of the foreign ministers of the three Scandinavian countries has been commented on by political figures. It is generally said that the three Scandinavian countries deeply hope that Finland and the Soviet Union can find a fair and lasting solution to the current dispute. If Germany can come forward to mediate and maintain Finland's independence, it would be welcomed by the three Scandinavian countries. (Havas dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>London - The Daily Express reported that the meeting of the foreign ministers of the three Scandinavian countries has accepted the proposal of Danish Foreign Minister Munch and decided to jointly mediate the war between Finland and the Soviet Union and try to protect Finland's freedom and independence. However, if a basis for mediation cannot be found, they will request Hitler to mediate. (Havas News Agency dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>Copenhagen - The foreign ministers of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden began their meeting yesterday afternoon. After the three foreign ministers had a small banquet together, they were summoned by Danish King Christian. After that, the advisors of the three foreign ministers began to hold a plenary meeting at Christiansborg Palace. Before attending the meeting, Danish Foreign Minister Munch told people that only a general agenda was prepared and there were no special points. It is expected that Swedish Foreign Minister Gunther and Norwegian Foreign Minister Koht will return to their respective capitals tonight. (Reuters dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<h3>French Newspaper Advocates Attacking the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Beijing - The Paris newspaper "Le Temps," a mouthpiece for the French Foreign Ministry, openly advocated attacking the Soviet Union yesterday, with British and French forces attacking the Caucasus border. The newspaper criticized Allied newspapers for reporting on Soviet attacks along that line, saying that the Soviet Union would not attempt such a thing. The newspaper stated that the Allied plan to blockade Germany would fail completely because Germany was using Soviet resources. Finland's resistance against the Soviet Union could make the Allied blockade of Germany more effective. To prevent the transport of Caucasian oil and Ukrainian grain, British and French forces should exploit the Soviet Union's weaknesses and attack in the Black Sea and Caucasus regions.

<h3>Altmark Incident: Norway Replies to British Note; States it has Fulfilled all International Responsibilities; Willing to Submit Disagreements to Arbitration; Britain Denies Sending Aircraft to Search for German Ship</h3>
<p>London - Norwegian Minister to Britain Colban visited Foreign Secretary Halifax yesterday afternoon and handed him a note regarding the "Altmark" incident, taking the opportunity to answer several questions raised by the Foreign Secretary on the 17th of this month. According to diplomatic sources, the Norwegian note has been carefully studied by the Foreign Office. (Havas dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>Oslo - The government has instructed Minister to Britain Colban to deliver a note to British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax, which first describes the circumstances of the German auxiliary ship "Altmark" being intercepted in Norwegian territorial waters, and states that although the ship was equipped with several small anti-aircraft guns for self-defense, they had been unloaded before entering Norwegian territorial waters. The captain of the Norwegian torpedo boat asked the German ship's captain if the ship was carrying people from other belligerent countries, and was told no. Furthermore, the ship did not initially enter the port of Bergen, as Prime Minister Chamberlain believed, so the 24-hour limit for berthing did not apply. As for its navigation in Norwegian territorial waters, no treaty or neutrality regulation initially stipulates a 24-hour limit. All of these points are undoubtedly true. Even when the British government sent a letter to the Norwegian government on May 23 last year, it firmly asserted that warships of all countries should have the right to pass through the territorial waters of neutral countries. In short, the Norwegian government has made every effort to fulfill all international responsibilities under any circumstances. As for the British government's eagerness to rescue its prisoners, the Norwegian government understands this, but all actions must be based on the actual provisions of existing treaties, which is something it cannot help. If the British government still insists on its original views, the Norwegian government is willing to submit the differences between the two sides to arbitration, the method of which can be jointly determined by the two governments. (Havas dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>Oslo - Regarding the "Altmark" incident, London political figures have indicated that the British government is likely to oppose arbitration and advocate direct negotiations between Britain and Norway. (Haitong dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>Oslo - The government has officially announced that British Minister Sir Dormer presented a note to the Foreign Ministry on the 20th of this month, reiterating the statement made by Foreign Secretary Halifax to our Minister to Britain Colban on the 17th of this month, stating that the British government believes that the Norwegian authorities failed to thoroughly inspect the German ship "Altmark," resulting in the failure to discover British prisoners, which was a failure to fulfill the duties of a neutral country. Therefore, all information regarding the inspection process and the various facts after the inspection should be provided by Norway. The government has now instructed Minister Colban to reply to the British government. (Havas dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>London - The Air Ministry has issued a public statement stating that foreign sources have reported that three British aircraft flew to Jossingfjord in Norway on the afternoon of this month to search for the German auxiliary ship "Altmark" and other German ships. This statement is completely unfounded. No British aircraft have performed this task. (Havas dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>London - Under-Secretary Butler said in the House of Commons today, in response to a question about the extent of Norwegian territorial waters, that due to the special shape of the Norwegian coastline, the delimitation of its territorial waters is now a matter of discussion. This issue cannot be said to have been finally decided. Although the Norwegian government has not abandoned its claim of a four-mile limit, it has informed the British government that it cannot maintain the three-mile neutrality clause beyond the coast in the current war. Butler also answered various supplementary questions, stating that Norwegian territorial waters have been greatly extended due to the existence of islands. (Reuters dispatch on the 26th)</p>

<h3>Britain and France Increase Troops in the Near East; Italy Deeply Troubled; Italian Possessions in Africa Directly Threatened; German Espionage Activities Also Struck</h3>
<p>Rome - There are rumors that the Soviet Union is putting pressure on the Iranian government, while Britain and France are conducting military preparations in the Near East. Foreign observers here have said that the Italian authorities are extremely troubled upon hearing this, as Italy is very eager to maintain peace in the Near East. However, if the Soviet Union extends its influence along the Persian Gulf and constantly incites unrest in that area by sending personnel, the danger would be significant; this is the first point. This Soviet plan is actually being encouraged by Germany. If Britain and France want to resist, their power in the Near East will be strengthened accordingly, and the proposal to form a group of Muslim countries under the leadership of Britain and France will also be facilitated. As a result, traffic between Italy and its African possessions will inevitably be controlled by Britain; this is the second point. Regarding this matter, some Italian figures have already expressed their dissatisfaction with Britain's self-proclaimed role as guardian of Muslim countries. They also regard the concentration of troops by Britain and France near Italian Libya in North Africa as a direct threat to Italian possessions, which can be used as a weapon to pressure Italy when necessary, and are therefore even more dissatisfied. Some Italian commentators even believe that Britain and France's strategic position in the Mediterranean has been strengthened daily, which is enough to undermine the balance of power in the Mediterranean. This contradicts the commitment accepted by Britain in the Anglo-Italian Agreement (April 16, 1938), which is even less welcome to Italy. In short, Italian figures are extremely concerned about the situation in the Near East, and their close attention to the activities of the Soviet Union and Britain and France in that area goes without saying. (Havas dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>London - According to a special dispatch from here, the Swiss Tribune reported that "German spies are trying to incite the public in the Near East and Middle East against Britain, but without success. The arrival of Australian troops in Egypt is a surprising response to German espionage activities, and another clear confirmation of the error of German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and others in predicting the disintegration of British countries." A newspaper in Budapest carried a news item entitled "The Construction Work of the British Empire in Arabia," which described the systematic work of Britain in deploying a network of bases along the Arabian border over the past twenty years, making the movement of the army under the command of General Weygand, commander of the Allied forces in the Near East, very convenient.

<h3>"Breaking the Terrorism of World Financial Groups" is Germany's War Aim; German Newspapers Comment on Hitler's Speech</h3>
<p>Berlin - Newspapers here have published the full text of Hitler's speech and issued comments, stating that Hitler has set "breaking the terrorism of world financial groups" as Germany's war aim. Newspapers said that Hitler's speech proved that he has absolute confidence in Germany's final victory. (Haitong dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>Berlin - Newspapers here commented on Chamberlain's recent speech, believing that his explanation of the causes and significance of the European war, and Britain's war aims, were all lies. Germany is determined to repel the attacks of British financial groups. The bravery and war aims of the German people are clear and beyond doubt. (Haitong Military dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>Rome - Italian newspapers published the speeches of Chamberlain and Hitler without editorial comment. People here now feel that discussions cannot affect the current situation. The most noteworthy thing now is whether neutral countries will be drawn into the war. (Reuters dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>The Hague - Neutral observers in Berlin believe that Hitler's speech did not change the overall situation. A dispatch from Berlin in the Rotterdam newspaper stated that the main purpose of Hitler's speech was to strengthen the connection between Germany and its people and to maintain the courage of the people. A dispatch from Berlin in the Telegraaf newspaper stated that those hoping to hear words leading to peace would be disappointed by Hitler's speech. (Reuters dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>London - According to a special dispatch today, the Memphis Commercial Appeal in the United States recently stated that the world should not worry that Germany is changing from Nazism to communism, because this change has already happened. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch stated that there is a rumor in economic circles that the Soviet oil obtained by Germany after the start of the war did not actually come from the Soviet Union's original oil wells, but from Soviet-occupied Poland, whose annual production is only 450,000 tons. The New York Times carried an article by Ms. McCormick stating that the feeling that Germany has been defeated is stronger in eastern Germany than in western Germany. It is strange that the countries most terrified by Germany have the least impression that Germany will win. (Reuters dispatch on the 26th)</p>

<p>Swedish Capital - When the House of Representatives met this afternoon, Prime Minister Hansson delivered a speech, stating that our country's adoption of a neutral policy is not a sign of weakness. This is because our people have confidence in the government's national defense policy. As for the war between Finland and the Soviet Union, the government and the House of Representatives share the same views, but there are some differences in the views held by public opinion. In short, the government believes that it has protected the country's interests in the best possible way, and has also made every effort to help Finland within its capabilities.

<h3>Romanian Oil Supply Issue; British Government Discussing</h3>

<h3>Finnish Foreign Minister's Statement: Ready to Negotiate with the Soviets, but Peace Cannot Compromise Security; Soviet Air Force Extensively Bombs Northern Finland</h3>
<p>Helsinki - Finnish Foreign Minister Tanner, in an exclusive interview with the Associated Press yesterday, stated that Finland is ready to negotiate peace with the Soviet Union on an honorable basis. He solemnly declared that Finland's security and independence cannot be compromised for peace. "Finland is always ready to end the war peacefully, and we are still not opposed to friendly mediation, but it cannot jeopardize our security. If Finland had received the assistance a month ago as it does today, the Soviet invasion of Finland might not have made any progress." He expressed disappointment that the United States had not provided aid to Finland, believing that economic aid from the United States would be most appropriate. He solemnly declared that Finland is determined to resist the Soviet Union by force and has not received promises of foreign pressure or foreign aid. (Associated Press dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>Helsinki - The Commander-in-Chief's military headquarters announced a battle report stating: (1) Yesterday, the Red Army launched attacks on our army's positions in certain areas, all of which failed. Our artillery units shattered several Red Army formations and destroyed seventeen tanks. (2) In the northeastern area of Lake Ladoga, repeated Red Army attacks were repelled, with two tanks, twenty-seven machine guns, twenty light machine guns, and a large number of rifles abandoned. (3) In the Petsamo port area, a ten-man patrol repelled a force of one hundred and eighty Red Army soldiers on skis. (4) Soviet aircraft were quite active yesterday, conducting extensive bombing raids in various parts of our northern region. Military observers further explained that although Viipuri is currently in a critical situation, from a general strategic point of view, the port is not of utmost military importance. This is because the Finnish government has built a railway to the northwest of the port to connect inland transportation. This measure will greatly reduce the advantages the Soviet Union can gain after occupying the port. The Red Army suffered heavy losses in attacking the port. Whether it is worth paying such a heavy price is questionable. (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>Viipuri's Barrier Has Been Breached</p>
<p>Helsinki - The latest Finnish war report admits that Finnish troops have abandoned Koivisto Island. It also states that the Finnish artillery units in that area are now shelling Soviet troops in the hinterland of Karelia.

Finnish aircraft engaged in reconnaissance and bombed enemy rear areas. Aerial combat was frequent in the battle zone. According to confirmed reports, five enemy aircraft were shot down, and the confirmation of two more is pending. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>Helsinki - The city of Viipuri, which the Soviet Union intends to capture, has been almost completely destroyed by bombs and artillery fire. According to a visitor who recently returned from there, Viipuri has become a heap of rubble, and many places in the city are on fire. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>Helsinki - After receiving reinforcements, Soviet troops launched a fierce attack on Viipuri last night. All the residents of the city have been evacuated. Soviet artillery units continue to bombard, and tanks are also assisting in the attack. Soviet troops have gradually gained a dominant position. Finnish sources have acknowledged that the fate of Viipuri, a key point on the right flank of the Mannerheim Line, is likely to be its fall. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>Helsinki - Fierce fighting is taking place in Viipuri today. Soviet troops are continuously shelling Finnish positions with artillery. Soviet aircraft are also dropping paratroopers behind Finnish lines. The paratroopers are equipped with complete armaments. According to received reports, Viipuri is still in Finnish hands, but only the Koivisto fortress has fallen. Near Suomussalmi, the Red Army, which had retreated to the border area several days ago, has launched a new offensive. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>Moscow - According to a communiqué from the headquarters of the Leningrad Military District, yesterday Soviet troops broke through the enemy's fortified zone in Karelia and immediately occupied twenty-eight fortifications, including eight strong forts. The enemy repeatedly attempted counterattacks, but all were repelled. There were no significant developments in other areas. The Soviet Air Force bombed enemy troops on all fronts with great success. In aerial combat, the Soviet Air Force also shot down ten enemy aircraft. (TASS dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>Stockholm - The Soviet Union issued a message yesterday, forcefully stating that the Red Army had occupied the fortresses on the islands of Björkö, Illynyari, and Billholmen in the Gulf of Finland. Finnish authorities have firmly denied this, saying that the Red Army forces attacking these islands have been valiantly repelled by Finnish troops. Although Red Army troops landed on Koivisto Island in the Gulf of Finland, they did not capture the Björkö fortress. (Havas dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>The Situation of the Mannerheim Line Deployment</p>
<p>Moscow Dispatch - The inside details of the Mannerheim Line, which is consuming thousands of Soviet soldiers daily, have recently been described by the "Pravda" magazine in an article by Red Army Regiment Commander Galin. It briefly stated that he read American newspapers and learned that Finland's Mannerheim Line includes three main defense lines: (1) the Karelian Isthmus, (2) the Helsinki area, and (3) the Viipuri area. Near Helsinki and Viipuri, fortresses are built along the coast to control the sea entrances. The defense line on the Karelian Isthmus is further divided into two parts: (1) from the Gulf of Finland to Lake Ladoga, crossing the isthmus, and (2) the central defense line. The first defense line runs parallel to the Soviet-Finnish border, with a depth of twelve kilometers, and is built with barbed wire obstacles, trenches, tank traps, and minefields. This line has a total of thirty-eight fortresses. The second defense line is even stronger and is the main defense line of the Finnish army. The fortresses on this line are all in a trapezoidal formation, with a depth of two kilometers to ten kilometers, and there are a total of one hundred and fifty fortresses, all equipped with multiple machine guns, barbed wire obstacles, and tank traps. The defense line in the Viipuri area includes the fortress line along the Saimaa to Antrea railway, coastal fortresses, and anti-aircraft gun emplacements. Eight fortresses have been built along the railway, with the ground for mounting heavy machine guns and cannons being eighty to one hundred centimeters thick, and its solidity can be imagined. The lakes and marshes of the Karelian Isthmus and the dense forests make it easy for Finnish troops to build fortress positions. From 1922 to 1939, Finland hired military experts from various European countries to assist in the design of this defense line. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 25th)</p>
<h3>German Aircraft Repeatedly Cross the Border; Netherlands Will Lodge a Strong Protest; Aircraft from Both Countries Briefly Engage in Air Combat over Northern Brabant Province, Netherlands</h3>
<p>The Hague - The Government Information Bureau announced: "Our patrol aircraft encountered a German Messerschmitt aircraft at an altitude of 8,000 meters over the town of Oss in northern Brabant province this morning. It immediately opened fire with machine guns to drive it away. The German aircraft also returned fire and then flew towards Roussel in Belgium. Our authorities believe that the German aircraft's intrusion into our airspace and shooting at our patrol aircraft is a gross act of recklessness, and we will naturally lodge a strong protest with the German government. Another German aircraft flew over the town of Woerden in the province of Utrecht and was fired upon by local anti-aircraft units before escaping to the southwest. We will also lodge a protest with the German government regarding this matter." (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>

The people living in the area between the border and this new defense line have been notified that they must be prepared to evacuate within a few hours of receiving a warning if the German military headquarters deems it necessary. Danish political circles believe that the construction of this defense line indicates that the Germans have recognized the current border as a permanent decision. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)</p>

<h3>Wartime Social Welfare; Talent Adjustment Association Established; Handling Applications for Job Selection Registration; Promulgating Measures for Travel Expense Loans</h3>
<p>Xu Shiying, Chen Lifu, and others, in order to solve the problem of wartime social personnel coordination, so as to achieve the effect of making the best use of people's talents and things, and to strengthen the strength of the War of Resistance and nation-building, specially organized the Wartime Social Welfare Talent Adjustment Association. The general headquarters is located in Chongqing, and work branches are established in various places, hoping to recruit technical talents from all over the country as much as possible to meet the needs of the rear. For those with various talents, from the war zone to the rear, or from the rear to the war zone, who lack travel expenses, the association will provide loans. As for those who have special skills and are currently unemployed, after passing the review, there are unemployment relief loans. For unemployed youths who generally do not have specialized skills, there are also adjustment measures. In addition to passive introductions, they also select the most needed and simpler skills in society and provide short-term training. The following are the application requirements for job selection registration, the measures for travel expense loans, and the measures for talent recruitment:</p>
<p>Job Selection Registration</p>
<p>(1) All citizens of the Republic of China who possess special skills suitable for social needs, are currently unemployed, or intend to change jobs for legitimate reasons may apply to the association and its branches for job selection registration. (2) All applicants for registration should fill out two talent registration forms at the association's work station, submit proof of resume, and two recent 2.5-inch half-length photos. If an applicant cannot personally register at the association's work station due to circumstances, they may register by mail or entrust someone else to register on their behalf. The procedures for filling out the form and submitting documents are still the same as in the previous item. (3) When an applicant for registration performs the registration procedures, the association's work station should send staff to conduct an interview and record the main points for reference in introducing work. If necessary, a corresponding examination and investigation may be conducted. If the applicant has not personally performed the registration procedures, the aforementioned interview or examination may be held before the introduction of work. (4) If the association's work station believes that an applicant for registration needs to be trained, the association may notify them to go to the designated address to receive training. The aforementioned training refers to spiritual and technical training that is beneficial to the applicant's future employment. (5) If the association's work station believes that an applicant for registration does have special skills and is suitable for social needs, the association should immediately select work on its behalf within the possible scope and introduce employment. (6) When there is a suitable job opportunity, the association will introduce it with the consent of the job selection registrant in one of the following ways: A. The association will prepare a letter of introduction and hand it over to the person being introduced to contact the employer for negotiation. B. The association will send staff to accompany the person being introduced to the employer's location for negotiation. C. The association will invite representatives from the employer and the job selection registrant to negotiate at the association's work station. (7) After the work is determined through introduction, the job selection registrant should fill out a guarantee form to the association, with a currently employed person with a legitimate job as the guarantor. The format of the guarantee form will be determined separately. (8) After the job selection registrant is introduced to employment by the association, they should report their service situation to the association by mail on a monthly basis. If their address changes, they should immediately notify the association to register in order to maintain contact. (9) If a job selection registrant is introduced to a job by the association, and both parties have determined the job but the registrant does not take the job for no reason, or is dismissed from the employing agency due to negligence, the association will no longer introduce them to jobs.</p>
<p>Travel Expense Loans</p>
<p>(1) Those who are willing to serve social welfare from the war zone to the rear, or from the rear to the war zone, who lack travel expenses, and who have one of the following qualifications, may apply to the association for a loan: A. Talents recruited by the association who have passed the review. B. Talents registered with the association who have been reviewed and found to have special skills. (2) All applicants for loans should state the purpose to the association's work station and obtain a guarantee that meets one of the following provisions: A. A reliable store guarantor approved by the work station. B. Two guarantors with legitimate jobs approved by the work station. C. A joint guarantee of more than ten people approved by the work station. (3) The loan amount is the necessary expenses such as boat, car, food, and accommodation from the location to the destination, which will be approved by the starting station according to the borrower's identity and the regulations of the general station. (4) The borrower may request a travel expense loan for a family member at the minimum limit, but limited to one person. (5) The loan amount will be paid by the starting station in one lump sum or by the branch station, depending on the actual situation at the time, and the relevant branch stations should be notified in advance. When the borrower arrives, the branch station will issue the amount due upon presentation of the proof of documents issued by the starting station. (6) After the borrower is employed, they should repay the association loan monthly according to the following proportions, based on the percentage of the total amount of their salary and other income, until the entire amount is paid off, and then they can retrieve their guarantee documents: (1) 20% for those with 50 yuan or less; (2) 25% for those with 51 yuan to 100 yuan; (3) 30% for those with 101 yuan to 150 yuan; (4) 40% for those with 251 yuan or more. (7) If a borrower's salary is less than 50 yuan after employment, and they have served in the work place introduced by the association for six months, have made definite achievements, and have been assessed and certified by the service place, and are still continuing to serve in the original service place, they may be allowed to extend or reduce or exempt a part of the repayment of their loan. (8) If a borrower delays starting the journey for no reason after obtaining the loan, or stays in transit, the association should immediately recover the entire amount of the loan. (9) If the borrower fails to fulfill the repayment obligation, the guarantor should be responsible for repaying the loan. (10) No interest or any fees will be charged for the loan. (11) For social welfare talents recruited by the association on behalf of various agencies or groups, the loan should be borne in whole or in part by the commissioning agency or group. The method shall be separately agreed upon by the association and the various agencies and groups when accepting the commission. (12) These measures will be implemented upon resolution by the Standing Council of the Association.</p>
<h3>Continuing Warfare Around Kinmen: Chinese Troops Capture Pingtan, Puppet Troops Defect En Masse Awaiting Reorganization</h3>
<p>Fuzhou Dispatch: After the recapture of Haitan Island (i.e., Pingtan County) in eastern Fujian by Chinese troops since New Year's Day, the remnants of the pirate Yu A'gao's forces, who had been entrenched on the island, fled to Nan Gan Tang, Dong Xi Yang Islands, still plotting to stir up trouble. Earlier this month, they gathered 700-800 men again, taking advantage of fierce artillery fire from Japanese warships, and forcibly landed on the southeastern coastal areas of the county. The stationed troops lured them deep inside, withdrawing the troops from the city. Part of them disguised as civilians was ambushed among the common people. The pirate gang advanced rapidly, occupying the county town. The troops, coordinating from inside and outside at night, launched a fierce pincer attack. Caught off guard, the pirates suffered heavy casualties and fled in panic, escaping into the sea. Among them, Yu Meihou, Lin Huiru, Yu Yunjuan, Wang Jianmin, Shi Shiqi, and Han Zhengqi, totaling over 500 people, defected due to the unfavorable situation, sailing from Dongyang Island to Pingtan awaiting reorganization. The remaining bandits entrenched in Nan Gan Tang will be suppressed by the troops stationed in Lianjiang County, who dispatched a team in mid-month to attack, killing over 80 men, capturing over 20 men, and seizing over 60 guns. The bandit forces are now exhausted and will soon be completely eliminated.</p>
<p>Chinese Troops Launch Cross-Sea Raid on Kinmen</p>
<p>Kinmen Island in southern Fujian has been occupied for two years. Patriotic people of the county organized the Kinmen Recovery and Save-Homeland Corps. On the evening of February 5th, the corps gathered dozens of brave men and crossed the sea by [redacted] to Kinmen. With swift and mobile tactics, they raided the puppet second district office in Shawei, capturing the former deputy chairman of the Kinmen puppet maintenance association and the current puppet second district chief and head of the Shawei puppet police station, Lang Shouchun, as well as a puppet sentry. They also distributed 2,000 copies of leaflets about the second raid on Kinmen. The Japanese troops in Kinmen were greatly panicked, announcing martial law and cutting off land and water transportation at night.</p>
<p>Puppet Troops Engage in Internal Strife, Resulting in Armed Conflict</p>
<p>Most of the Japanese troops in Xiamen have now been transferred to Guangdong to fight, and pirates from Haitan and Meizhou Islands have been transferred to garrison, reorganized into the "Peace and National Construction Army." One is under the command of Horinouchi, stationed in the old chamber of commerce on Zhongshan Road, and the other is under the command of Sato, stationed in the New World on Xiahe Road. Every day, groups of three to five go out gambling and whoring, entering and leaving civilian homes to intimidate and extort. Due to conflicts of interest, disputes and struggles often occur, accumulating mutual dislike. Chinese personnel took the opportunity to distribute small leaflets in the Fuyu Island and Xiahe Road areas, advising compatriots who were arrested and forced into the puppet army to wake up as soon as possible. The puppet troops stationed in the old chamber of commerce pointed out that these leaflets were distributed by the puppet soldiers stationed in the New World, surrounded the New World, and wanted to confiscate the weapons of Sato's troops. The two sides engaged in armed conflict, attacking each other for several hours, resulting in [number unclear] deaths and injuries. The Japanese side disarmed the [unclear] responsible puppet troops and handed them over to the Japanese Navy for investigation. The turmoil subsided.</p>
<p>Educational News</p>
<h3>Flexible Implementation of New Regulations for Hong Kong School Buildings: Authorities Dispatch Personnel to Investigate Schools, Improving According to New Regulations in Due Course</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong Dispatch) The Hong Kong Bureau of Education recently promulgated new education regulations. The Hong Kong and Kowloon Education Workers Union believed that they were difficult to implement, so they requested the Education Secretary to delay their implementation. Now they have also submitted a memorial to the Governor of Hong Kong, making a strong request. Yesterday, the reporter specially visited Education Secretary Solicitor to inquire about the current steps and attitude of the education authorities in implementing the new regulations. According to Solicitor, the new education regulations promulgated by the Hong Kong government were originally scheduled to be implemented on January 1 this year. The Hong Kong Education Workers Union believed that the implementation of the new regulations would affect both teachers and students, so they sent representatives to see him, requesting amendments to the new regulations. However, he believed that the new regulations had just begun to be implemented, and no one could say before implementation whether they would benefit or harm teachers and students. The Education Bureau has specially approved two measures for flexible implementation of the new regulations: (1) Schools registered with the Bureau before January 1, 1940, will be investigated separately by personnel dispatched by the Bureau to determine the extent to which they meet the standards of the new regulations and ordered to improve according to the new regulations in due course. Investigators have already been dispatched to handle this work, but because there are many schools in Hong Kong, this investigation work will take a long time to complete. He believes that it will be completed within this year. (2) All schools registered with the Bureau after January 1, 1940, must comply with all the new regulations. The reporter then inquired about his personal opinion on the new regulations. He replied that the Hong Kong government's revision of the new education regulations was due to the fact that many of the rules in the education laws were not perfect. In order to improve education in Hong Kong and raise the standard of education, the new education regulations were specially revised. He believes that the most important elements of education are two: (1) the equipment of the school buildings and the hygiene inside the school buildings, and (2) the qualifications of teachers. The standards of Hong Kong schools vary widely, and it is difficult to estimate the number or average number that can meet the standards of the new regulations.</p>

<h3>Proposed Tax Increase by the Public Works Department Arouses Criticism from Chinese and Foreigners, General Facts Listed and Criticized, Citizen's Ability to Bear Not Considered</h3>
<p>The English-language Da Mei Evening News reported that the Public Works Department announced this morning (26th) that it plans to increase the municipal general tax, special property tax, and land tax by 50 percent. Regarding this matter, the reporter recently inquired with general Chinese taxpayers, who believe that "the cost of living has already risen, and there is a tendency to rise even further. How can the Public Works Department expect them to pay even higher taxes?" The Chinese Taxpayers Association of the Public Concession will not make an official criticism of this issue until a special meeting is held soon to study it closely.</p>
<p>HSBC Agrees to Lend Ten Million</p>
<p>Various parties are deeply concerned about the news that the Public Works Department plans to increase various taxes due to financial exhaustion. Yesterday, Mr. J.W. Morcher, the Finance Director of the Public Works Department, told people that the Public Works Department has obtained the permission of HSBC Bank in Shanghai to borrow money to make up for this budget deficit. This loan will be repaid with tax revenue after the tax increase plan is approved by the Western Taxpayers Annual Meeting. According to informed sources, the amount of HSBC Bank's loan to the Public Works Department is approximately ten million yuan. If this loan can be achieved, all budget deficits will be made up by adding a minimum of 50 percent to various surtaxes. Otherwise, the budget deficit of the Public Works Department will become even larger.</p>
<p>Paying Salaries in Pounds is Extremely Inappropriate</p>
<p>However, a certain leader of Chinese residents claimed that since the Public Works Department's income is all in local currency, it should not have hired so many foreigners who are paid in pounds from the beginning. Some foreigners should have been replaced by qualified Chinese a long time ago. Another major Chinese taxpayer raised the issue of the Public Works Department's orchestra, saying that the Chinese Taxpayers Association has repeatedly opposed maintaining this "luxury." Those who love old music can also be satisfied by listening to gramophone records.</p>
<p>How Can Salary Earners Bear It?</p>
<p>A certain major Chinese claimed that he understands that the Public Works Department's economic burden will be heavy next year, but the department should not forget one thing, that is, most of the taxpayers in Shanghai are Chinese with small salaries. They have already encountered a high cost of living, and now the municipal tax continues to increase, making prices even higher, so they will be unable to bear it. Even if the Public Works Department finds that increasing taxes is inevitable, an increase of 50 percent is still too much. It is better to increase it every six months.</p>
<p>Only Concerned with Income, Ignoring People's Livelihood</p>
<p>Most of the Chinese taxpayers the reporter met criticized the Public Works Department for spending more time discussing their own income and less time discussing taking strict actions to curb hoarding and profiteering. If the department lowers the cost of living, taxpayers will be able to cope with the increase in taxes more easily. Now, residents of the two concessions have been moving out one after another because of lower electricity fees and taxes outside the concessions.</p>
<p>Why Not Reclaim the Japanese-Occupied Areas?</p>
<p>The Public Works Department should adopt a more resolute attitude and demand the return of the Hongkou, Huishan, and Yangshupu areas from the Japanese Bureau, which may increase revenue. The Public Works Department does not collect taxes on certain types of taxes that can be levied, such as the unlimited issuance of permits to the Japanese military by the Shanghai Defense Army. The number of Japanese cars and trucks with defense army permits and those without permits at all is far greater than the total number of permits held by the British, American, and Italian defense armies. Some cars with defense army permits are used by people who have nothing to do with the Japanese defense army.</p>
<p>Foreign Merchants Have Different Opinions</p>
<p>As for the general opinion of major foreign merchants in Shanghai, they believe that the tax increase by the Public Works Department is inevitable and should have been increased several years ago. The Public Works Department and its finance department have taken stupid measures in the past few years. According to a certain foreign merchant, even if the taxes in Shanghai are increased, they may still be lower than those in other cities in the world. For example, property taxes in the UK can be as high as 100 percent, and the lowest is about 40 percent.</p>
<p>Superficial Prosperity, Many Impoverished</p>
<p>He believes that the newspapers in the city should support the Public Works Department. Some Chinese will of course oppose it, but they should understand the protection they receive in the Public Concession. Shanghai is superficially prosperous, surpassing any city in the world. The poor may account for a larger proportion, but there are quite a few who can afford to pay higher taxes.</p>
<p>Orchestra Expenses Can Be Greatly Reduced</p>
<p>Another merchant claimed that the Public Works Department has made major mistakes in its economic arrangements, such as never considering the exchange rate. Now that the department is increasing taxes, residents have no choice but to pay in order to obtain police and fire protection. However, there are one or two major expenses that do not seem absolutely necessary, such as the orchestra, which is the most inappropriate. The orchestra only performs for a small number of residents in a small theater in the French Concession, so he believes that the expenses of the orchestra should be reduced and transferred to the police department, which has a difficult task. The police department has now lost some excellent personnel, who have resigned due to low salaries.</p>
<h3>The Puppet Land Bureau's Enticement to Register Title Deeds Has Failed</h3>
<p>The property title certificates of the people in the suburban areas of Shanghai were stored in safe places by the owners after the war. The so-called "Land Bureau" last year hoped to organize the land and entice the owners to submit their property title certificates in order to collect "land tax." After more than a year, because the people were unwilling to easily let go of the legal land practice certificates issued by the former Land Administration Bureau, it proved that the "Land Bureau's" scheme to entice them had failed. Since last winter, the "Bureau" has also attempted to entice foreign merchants to register their British title deeds, which were a type of real estate certificate held by foreign merchants in the former Qing Dynasty and existed in Zhabei, Jiangwan, Wusong, and Baoshan. After hearing the news, most foreign merchants ignored it. Although five or six British merchants have sent letters to the puppet "Bureau" declaring that they retain the property rights of their British title deeds, it is only a notification procedure. As of now, not a single foreign company has followed the wishes of the puppet "Bureau" and completed the so-called "reporting procedure." Therefore, the "Bureau's" second scheme, to entice foreign merchants to register their British title deeds and certificates, has also failed.</p>
<h3>Team Leader Xie Continues to Send Condolence Money</h3>
<p>Regarding the case of the White Russians attacking citizens without cause in the Lone Army Camp, it is now known that one of the seriously injured citizens, Chen Jinyu, is still in the hospital and has not recovered, especially his head. According to the Lone Army Camp, it has received 40 yuan in consolation money from the Gancheng Academic Research Society, which has been distributed accordingly. In addition to the previous distribution of 10 yuan per person in consolation money, Team Leader Xie has now sent an additional 20 yuan each, as well as daily necessities such as homemade soap, socks, and towels.</p>
<h3>日方改造蕰藻浜大橋</h3>
<p>The Wusong Yunzaobang Bridge is one of the largest bridges on the Shanghai-Wusong route. In the spring of the 19th year of the Republic of China (1930), the municipal government allocated 200,000 yuan for its reconstruction. Before its completion, the January 28th Incident occurred, and the 19th Route Army burned the bridge deck. Afterwards, the Public Works Bureau made makeshift repairs, focusing only on resurfacing the bridge. During the August 13th Incident, the bridge was damaged a second time. Recently, the Japanese are converting Yunzaobang into a commercial port, expanding its width to 60 zhang (approximately 200 meters). Therefore, the Japanese have designed a reconstruction style for the bridge similar to the Waibaidu Bridge. The construction is being undertaken by units sent by the Army. The project is quite large and will take more than three years to complete.</p>
<h3>舉辦健康比賽同鄉組遊藝大會</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association's Hometown Group Fundraising Committee will hold a variety show at the New World starting March 9th. In addition to adding various performances, a children's health competition and a "Longevity and Happiness" event for the elderly will also be held. The intention is profound. Detailed rules have been established and registration has begun. Children aged two to twelve, regardless of gender, can participate. The entire group of doctors from the Relief Association's health team will be responsible for the examination. The first-place prize is a cash reward of 100 yuan, the second place (two people) will receive 30 yuan each, the third place (ten people) will receive 5 yuan each, and the fourth place (fifty people) will receive items worth 3 yuan each. All other participating children will receive a gift. Elderly people aged 70 and above are eligible to participate. Those who wish to participate can obtain the rules from the association at No. 6, Lane 102, Tongfu Road.</p>
<h3>法總領昨特聲明謠傳貢米禁運來滬　越督正式否認</h3>
<p>French Consul General to Shanghai, Mr. Baudic, specifically stated yesterday that the Governor-General of Annam officially denies the recent rumors in the rice market that the Annam authorities have prohibited the shipment of Saigon rice to China. Since January 1st of this year, 55,000 tons of Saigon rice have been specially permitted to be shipped to Shanghai. Furthermore, the approval is continuing to be issued without obstruction.</p>
<p>米價回跌</p>
<p>Rice prices fall back</p>
<p>Rice speculators spread rumors in the market, falsely claiming that French Annam would ban rice exports, in an attempt to raise rice prices. After French Consul General Baudic's statement was published, the rumors in the market ceased. The rice merchants have no means to implement their tricks. As a result, yesterday's rice market, for both domestic and foreign rice, fell back by one or two yuan. It is also known that a large amount of Saigon foreign rice has already been loaded onto ships on February 1st and will arrive in Shanghai soon.</p>
<p>請給外滙</p>
<p>Please give foreign exchange</p>
<p>The People's Food Regulation Association is carrying out price controls to help the poor. Due to limitations in donations and costs, the goal has not been achieved. The 15th, 36th, and 37th district branches of the Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Association jointly sent a letter to the People's Food Regulation Association yesterday, stating that the food problem is severe and the situation is worse than before, with crises lurking everywhere. They implore the authorities to follow the previous example and grant a legal foreign exchange rate for the purchase of foreign rice for price controls in the city to alleviate the suffering of the poor and suppress rising prices.</p>
<p>施振擴展</p>
<p>Expand relief efforts</p>
<p>The Charity Federation has been distributing steamed buns and soup since yesterday. A new location has been designated at the open space behind the Jade Buddha Temple at the intersection of Ma Bai Road and Gordon Road. It was distributed simultaneously with Dahua Road starting at 4 pm yesterday. It was found that the area is densely populated with poor people, so the number of people waiting for relief was exceptionally crowded, totaling no less than 5,000 people. In addition, the Buddhist Fellowship of this port has achieved good results since the establishment of issuing porridge tickets. The association has recently printed a large number of porridge tickets for all sectors to distribute, at 20 tickets per yuan, in units of two yuan. The recipients of the tickets distribute them themselves, or they can entrust the association to distribute them on their behalf, which is very effective.</p>
<h3>日方意向迄未明瞭工部局及各界重視郵政總局大廈　被圈入警戒區</h3>
<p>The intention of the Japanese side is still unclear. The Municipal Council and all sectors attach importance to the Post Office Building being encircled in the restricted area.</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, the Hongkou area has been temporarily administered by the Japanese army. Chinese people entering and exiting must not only have a "pass," but are also subject to searches from time to time. Those wishing to go to the Post Office Administration at the Sichuan Road bridgehead can enter and exit through the side door of the bureau on North Suzhou Road, which is considered convenient. Unexpectedly, on the afternoon of the 24th of this month, the Japanese suddenly set up barbed wire fences on the east side of the North Suzhou Road Waterworks Bridgehead in the name of the "Concession Forces Command," blocking vehicles and erecting a wooden sign stating that it was necessary to enter and exit from the Sichuan Road Bridge and Wenjianshi Road. Although the barbed wire fence on the west side of the Sichuan Road Bridgehead was removed at the same time, the main entrance of the post office has not yet been opened.</p>
<p>進出麻煩</p>
<p>Inconvenient entry and exit</p>
<p>Since then, people from all walks of life who go to the Post Office Administration have to go around, and Japanese soldiers conduct inspections from time to time, which is twice as troublesome. Many have switched to sending and receiving mail through branch offices. The entire staff of the post office is also uneasy. Postmaster Zha Peilin has telegraphed the Kunming Post Office Administration for instructions, as this move actually encircles the Post Office Administration within the Hongkou restricted area, causing great inconvenience to the public.</p>
<p>意向不明</p>
<p>Unclear intention</p>
<p>Zha Peilin inquired with the Municipal Council about the Japanese side's special actions, but the intention of the Japanese side was still unclear. Zha later sent the Japanese Deputy Postmaster Kinzashi Kinichiro to negotiate with the Japanese consulate and relevant parties at 2 pm yesterday, but has not yet received a reply. The Municipal Council also attaches great importance to this matter. A reporter from Datong News Agency visited the bureau at noon yesterday and found that the number of people in the business office on the second floor who were mailing letters and handling other postal matters had decreased significantly. The number of packages waiting to be sent at the parcel delivery office on the first floor was even more sparse. The public is inconvenienced in their travels, which indirectly affects the business of the post office. Therefore, the outside world is very concerned about this incident.</p>
<h3>加緊宵禁滬西意軍防區</h3>
<p>The Italian army defense zone in western Shanghai tightens the curfew.</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Municipal Council and the puppet government signed the temporary police power agreement for the road construction beyond the boundaries in western Shanghai, the Municipal Council Police Department has especially strengthened the police force in the area. The Italian defense forces under the jurisdiction of the district suddenly tightened the curfew starting the night before last. After 00:30, several patrol teams, each with about 20 people, were dispatched to areas such as Robert Road, Jiaozhou Road, Singapore Road, Caojiadu, Bailinan Road, and Jessfield Road, taking turns patrolling until 9:00 the next morning. Any suspicious pedestrians were taken to the Italian barracks opposite Jiaozhou Park. It is said that this action by the Italian soldiers is nothing more than to curb illegal activities in order to maintain law and order in the defense zone.</p>
<h3>安南煤屑全從海防運來運費高昂影響煤球成本市商會函工部局　商減煤屑運費</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Municipal Council to discuss reducing the freight of coal dust. All the coal dust from Annam is transported from Haiphong, and the high freight rate affects the cost of coal briquettes.</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce has repeatedly consulted with the Shanghai Machine-Made Coal Briquette Industry Association to lower the market price of coal briquettes. It has notified all coal briquette factories to produce as much as possible, in the hope that there will be a surplus of coal briquettes and that supply and demand can be balanced. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, for the sake of a fundamental solution, specifically sent a letter to the Public Concession Municipal Council. The original letter stated, "Regarding the rising price of coal briquettes in the city, which has caused panic among residents regarding fuel, this chamber has repeatedly discussed with the Machine-Made Coal Briquette Industry Association and requested that they instruct all coal briquette factories to produce as much as possible and lower the selling price. However, the coal dust required for coal briquettes in this city is entirely supplied by French Annam coal mines, about 1,000 tons per day and 30,000 tons per month, all transported from Haiphong. The current high shipping costs affect the production cost of coal briquettes, which is a real obstacle to stabilizing the selling price of coal briquettes. After consultation with the industry, this chamber believes that the only way to solve the problem is to write to your council, requesting that it convene various shipping companies on a regular basis to discuss how to reduce shipping costs so that coal briquette factories can produce as much as possible and sell at a low price. This would be very fortunate. This matter is for the sake of stabilizing the lives of citizens, so please help as much as possible to achieve it. This is addressed to you."</p>
<p>煤業今日集議辦法</p>
<p>Meiye’s collective discussion method today</p>
<p>After the Coal Briquette Industry Association announced that all owners of coal briquette vouchers must clear their goods within ten days, all voucher holders went to various coal briquette factories to pick up their goods. However, the coal briquette factories shirked their responsibilities in every possible way, so the voucher holders could not pick up their goods. They sent representatives the day before yesterday to the Coal Industry Association to request that they contact the Coal Briquette Industry Association and notify all manufacturers to deliver the goods as agreed. The association decided to wait for a meeting to discuss the matter in detail. It is now known that the Coal Industry Association has scheduled a joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees for 3 pm today at the association's office on Tianjin Road. It is said that in addition to discussing the above issues at that time, the meeting will also discuss the methods for stabilizing fuel in Shanghai.</p>
<p>廿五煤球廠生產量</p>
<p>Twenty-five coal briquette factory production volumes</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Machine-Made Coal Briquette Industry Association began to investigate the production volume of each factory during the fixed price period, a reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency recorded their production volume on February 25 as follows: (1) Yi Tai Xing 341.40 tons, (2) Nanyang First Factory 117.30 tons, (3) Nanyang Second Factory 189 tons, (4) Guohua 161.625 tons, (5) Dongfang 135.50 tons, (6) Jinghua 59.26 tons, (7) Guanghua 58.125 tons, (8) Yuedong 27.50 tons, (9) Yuanhua 12 tons, (10) Beiyang 14.675 tons, (11) Hu Licheng 15 tons, (12) Huacheng Cuiji 15.50 tons, (13) Nanhua 3 tons, (14) Heji temporarily suspended, (15) Nanfang Changji 16.725 tons, (16) Gongyong 10 tons, (17) Gongping 1.40 tons, (18) Yanyan 3 tons, (19) Wufu temporarily suspended, (20) Xin Ping An Ji 2.5 tons, totaling 1181.51 tons. Yuedong produced a total of 85 tons from the 22nd to the 24th, and Yanyan produced 9 tons.</p>

<h3>酒業堅決反對組織酒行市塲　菸酒本有特稅雖無統制之名早有統制之實何必再設市塲</h3>
<p>The liquor industry firmly opposes the organization of the liquor market. Although tobacco and alcohol are subject to special taxes and there is no name for control, there is already control in reality. Why set up a market again?</p>
<p>The 43 industry members of the Shanghai Liang Shaojiu Industry Association, in order to oppose the plan to form a liquor market, held a temporary industry meeting at Yile Dog Liang Shaojiu tea house on Nanjing Road at 3 pm the day before yesterday to discuss countermeasures.</p>
<p>Refuse to participate in the market and urge industry members to pay close attention. For the sake of caution, the association specifically issued a "Public Announcement by All Industry Members Opposing the Plan to Form a Liquor Market in an Attempt to Control It." The transcript is as follows: "Recently, someone or other has been using a stamp similar to the liquor industry, stamping blank presentation paper, and taking it to various shops, saying they want to apply for the organization of a liquor market.</p>
<p>Demanding that people stamp as such for control of liquor, or in the future, they will not be able to distribute goods. Threats and enticements, nothing is too extreme. Those who have not been to each shop are also notified by phone. There are two or three who do not understand the situation and are simple-minded, and have been tricked into stamping it. However, our entire 40+ families are not to be influenced by one or two people. Tobacco and alcohol are subject to special taxes, and although there is no name for control, there is already control in reality. Why set up a market again to engage in control? Examining their intentions, it is nothing more than wanting to collect commissions and raise market prices, so as to profit from it. Even selling out the entire industry will not stop them. Moreover, local shaojiu is among the most complex and fragmented of liquors. It is also needed by the lower and middle classes of society. In the past, Shanghai sold more than 100,000 dan per year. Since the Shanghai Incident, transportation has been blocked, and costs and freight have increased, and the selling price has gradually become more expensive. People's purchasing power is weak, so in the past two years, less than 100,000 dan has been sold each year. If control is established again, regardless of how much commission is charged, the goods will be transported to the warehouse, and then distributed to various places from the warehouse. The cost of the car and the labor spent on the road is already considerable, plus the high prices. The result will be to rival imported brandies and whiskeys. I ask, does the lower and middle classes of society have the economic power to buy it? Moreover, the containers of local shaojiu are of different sizes, and the ingredients vary greatly. It is not easy to transport and sell them, and they must be weighed and returned to their original containers. Even if you want to control them, it is not a</p>
<p>fact that one can count on. In general, at this time when everything is expensive, local shaojiu is one of the consumer goods. We should find ways to unblock the source and try to reduce the selling price, so that we can barely maintain it. How can we allow it to be wantonly destroyed and pushed to suicide? For this reason, our entire industry is resolutely opposed to the organization of the liquor market. We will never obey. At the same time, we urge someone or other to quickly get over themselves and stop acting so recklessly and no longer be active, so as to avoid being abandoned by the public, so that the livelihoods of all people can be prolonged. We hope that our humble intentions will be noted.</p>
<h3>郵員要求津貼　交部電復酌增</h3>
<p>Postal workers request allowance increase. Ministry of Communications telegraph reply: discretionary increase.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Administration and all its branch offices' Class A and B postal workers have been ordered to receive 80% of their salary after the war, and this has been the case for more than three years. However, currently, the price of goods in the market has soared and life is difficult. The entire body of postal workers sent a joint letter to the Postal Workers' Union last month, requesting that it telegraph the Minister of Communications Zhang Gongquan, to approve the restoration of their original salary, so as to maintain their meager livelihoods. According to a reporter from Xinsheng News Agency, Zhang has telegraphed to Shanghai, approving a discretionary increase in allowances. However, the amount has not yet been officially announced by the Shanghai Post Office Director Zha Peilin.</p>
<h3>申請外滙辦法　業已頒布</h3>
<p>Methods for applying for foreign exchange have been promulgated.</p>
<p>應往審核委會核准收百分之一手續費</p>
<p>Must be approved by the Review Committee and charged a 1% handling fee.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance instructed the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and the Banking Association, etc., stating that the rules for applying to purchase foreign exchange for imported goods were announced and implemented by the Ministry on July 3 of last year, and they were ordered to be informed. All procedures have been specified and announced to applicants and banks handling the matter for compliance. Now, in order to facilitate compliance, eleven articles of the detailed rules for the implementation of the rules for applying to purchase foreign exchange for imported goods have been formulated, announced and implemented by the Ministry. In addition to submitting them to the Executive Yuan for review and record, they are also issued to various branches. It is ordered that a copy of the detailed rules be attached for their information. The original text of the detailed rules is omitted, but it stipulates that when applying to purchase foreign exchange for imported goods, in addition to complying with the rules for applying to purchase foreign exchange for imported goods, the detailed rules for implementation must also be followed. Applicants must be approved by the Foreign Exchange Review Committee, and banks may charge the original applicant a 1% handling fee on the amount of foreign exchange paid.</p>
<h3>中賑會　撫輯難民</h3>
<p>The Central Relief Committee provides relief to refugees.</p>
<p>頒訂統一救濟辦法滬市善團已奉明電</p>
<p>Unified relief methods have been issued. Shanghai charity groups have received clear telegrams.</p>
<p>The Central Relief Committee believes that as the war zone is expanding, refugees who have no home to return to should be properly assisted. It has specially formulated unified relief methods and instructed relief agencies across the country to comply with them. Charity groups in Shanghai have received the above methods, which are recorded as follows: (1) Refugees, regardless of age, will be issued 2 jiao of national currency per person per day in accordance with regulations. Relief tickets should be filled out. If relief tickets are not available, the refugees should sign, stamp, or fingerprint to acknowledge receipt for verification. (2) Counties may spend relief funds as needed and truthfully, subject to review by the county council and forwarded for reporting, without waiting for orders to use them. (3) Relief funds will be issued by the province as reserve funds. If the reserve funds are insufficient, a telegram will be sent for verification and issuance, and funds may also be advanced from other transferable funds. (4) Each county should immediately mobilize local people with credibility or enthusiasm for relief to organize a refugee handling committee in order to concentrate manpower and participate in the handling of relief. (5) Evacuating refugees should issue refugee certificates in accordance with regulations, filling in the evacuation location, and strictly verifying to prevent spies and Japanese plainclothes teams. Except for those who have special tasks, refugees are generally not allowed to return to the occupied areas. (6) In special circumstances, when parents of children in areas close to the war zone are unable to carry them away, the county should assign special personnel to quickly rescue and concentrate them for care, and find ways to send them to safe areas. All lost and orphaned children should be widely taken in by the county. Relief funds for transporting children should be reported in accordance with the rate of 2 jiao of national currency per person per day for food and transportation costs. After the children are transported to safe areas, a telegram should be sent immediately to await orders for handling.</p>
<h3>節省酒筵救難</h3>
<p>Save on banquets to help refugees</p>
<p>Yuanji Transportation Customs Declaration Firm at No. 56 Yangxing Street in the French Concession, in order to promote saving on banquets to help refugees, sent 100 yuan saved from banquets during the New Year to the Refugee Relief Association at No. 93 Guangdong Road the day before yesterday (the 23rd). Their actions are commendable. It is hoped that all sectors will emulate them.</p>
<h3>義國在滬購地　建義僑中心區　其中將有敎堂醫院學校有華麗總會供社交活動</h3>
<p>Italy purchases land in Shanghai to build a center for the Italian community, which will include a church, hospital, school, and a luxurious clubhouse for social activities.</p>
<p>The Zi Lin Bao newspaper said that after the Italian government purchased a piece of land in western Shanghai from the Municipal Council, the Italian community in the city will have its own church, hospital, school, and clubhouse. It is expected that these new buildings will begin construction on the purchased land in two months. It is known that the land is located between Great Western Road, Difeng Road, and Jing'an Temple Road, opposite Hong En Hospital.</p>
<p>呈三角形</p>
<p>Shaped like a triangle</p>
<p>It measures 25 mu and 201, and was purchased by Italian Consul General to Shanghai, Ni Long, on behalf of the Italian government through negotiations with the Municipal Council. The land deed will be transferred at the beginning of this week, but the Municipal Council has several small houses built on the land, which will continue to be occupied until the end of March, after which the land will be handed over to the Italian side and will become the new "center" of the Italian community in Shanghai. According to the Italian people in Shanghai, in addition to the Italian General Assembly, there is no special</p>
<p>Schools and hospitals</p>
<p>The authorities have been considering this kind of need for more than a day. Now that the new land is available, they will build a large number of buildings. Yesterday (the 25th), Ni Long told reporters that, for the sake of convenience, the new buildings will be built together. Undoubtedly, the Italian bridge in this city will recognize the new buildings as their</p>
<p>All activities</p>
<p>The Italian government purchased this land because the Italian community had this need. According to the current Italian community in Shanghai, they all go to various churches in the city to attend worship. On special dates, they go to the Italian church in Shanghai to attend Mass. However, when the new buildings are completed, the Italian community will have its own church and hospital, etc. When the school is completed, it will be able to meet the greatest needs of the Italian community. Because there is no Italian school in the city now,</p>
<p>Children of Italian expatriates</p>
<p>All go to foreign schools for education. As for the social center, a luxurious Italian clubhouse will be built in the new house. However, the sale of the land has not yet been announced. The English-language Great American Evening Post said that Philip, the Director General of the Municipal Council, told reporters today (the 26th) that the reason why the land opposite Hong En Hospital, which has now been sold to the Italian government, was not put up for public auction was because the Municipal Council did not intend to let the land be used for</p>
<p>Commercial development</p>
<p>For this reason, the Municipal Council really has the intention of keeping the land for future development, but the Italian government requested to buy it, and its price was considered reasonable, and it was used to build a center for the Italian community, which is beneficial to the Italian community and has public value, so the Municipal Council allowed the sale, and I am not willing to disclose the price at present, but when the land deed is signed, the Bureau will issue an announcement.</p>
<h3>老鳳祥銀樓股東拆股未遂　經理接嚇詐信　具名特務隊索詐鉅款研究筆跡郭秀開被捕該樓前晚被盜刦鉅款</h3>
<p>Old Phoenix Silver Building shareholders split shares unsuccessfully. The manager receives a threatening letter demanding a large sum of money from a named secret service team. Handwriting expert Guo Xiukai arrested. The building was robbed of a large sum of money the night before last.</p>
<p>Old Phoenix Silver Building at No. 432 Nanjing Road was opened by Fei Zushou, Fei Changnian, Guo Yutang, Xu Busheng and others as partners for many years. Fei Zushou served as the manager and made a good profit. However, since January 28 last year, Guo Yutang suddenly announced that he wanted to split his shares and</p>
<p>Request an audit</p>
<p>As a result of the audit, Guo Yutang believes that the capital and dividends that he should receive for splitting his shares should be more than 190,000 yuan. However, Fei Zushou believes that Guo's settlement method is not realistic. According to a fair settlement, Guo's principal and income are only more than 50,000 yuan. The method and amount of payment are too far apart, so the share split has not been resolved so far. Guo Yutang has repeatedly stated that Fei has engaged in fraudulent behavior and must file a lawsuit, but there has been no action. Until December 25 and 29 of last year, Fei Zushou received two threatening letters from a named special service team. Although the letters did not mention the amount of money being demanded, the wording was extremely threatening. Fei was afraid and entrusted lawyers Jiang Baoli and Jiang Pingfan to report to the Old Gate Patrol Room. After investigation by Western Detective Heerkux and Chinese Detective Xue Youwen, it was considered that Guo Yutang's son Guo Xiukai (Chaozhou native, 23 years old, residing at No. 5, Lane 271, Xiafei Road) was highly suspected. After investigating Guo Xiukai's usual letters and checking the handwriting, the handwriting of the threatening letters was found to be very similar to the handwriting written by Guo. He was again summoned to the patrol room to write numbers for comparison, which was also very similar. His handwriting was also obtained from Guo's school, and Mei Yu, a handwriting expert from the Municipal Council, made a detailed identification, which also determined that the threatening letters were written by Guo Xiukai. The patrol room then reported to the First Special Court and issued an arrest warrant. Guo Xiukai was arrested the day before yesterday and sent to the Criminal Court of the First Special Court yesterday morning. Patrol Room lawyer Ru Baoyi prosecuted him for the crimes of obstructing freedom, threatening fraud, and attempted fraud under Articles 304, 305, and 346 of the Criminal Law. Since this case still needs to be investigated, it was requested that the hearing be postponed. The defendant Guo Xiukai stated that the threatening letters were not written by him. There are many traces of his handwriting left at the Old Phoenix Building, which are very easy to verify. How could he write a threatening letter to the plaintiff in his own handwriting? Therefore, there are obvious doubts in this matter, and he hired lawyer Zou Yu to defend him. Judge Xiao Xiefei verified the confession and ordered Guo Xiukai to be remanded in custody for another hearing in a week. In addition, Old Phoenix Silver Building was suddenly invaded by five bandits at 10:20 the night before last.

<p>Two criminals arrested and tried for intimidation and fraud.</p>
<p>Zhou Dasheng, the owner of the Xie Xing Iron Factory in Caojiadu, western Shanghai, lives at No. 51, Lane 831, Qiwupu Road, Hongkou. At 6:30 pm on the 22nd of this month, Zhu Genquan and others from Wuxi suddenly went to Zhou's house, claiming that Zhou was a guerrilla and had to be detained at the Japanese Command. If he could pay 5,000 yuan, they could find a way to get him out. At that time, Zhou happened to be out, so his wife Zhu and his mother Zhang negotiated on his behalf and agreed to talk again the next day. At that time, Lu Fangquan from Jiangxi went to Zhou's house, and Zhou reported him to the Yulin Road Patrol Room, who sent Detective Peng Zhenxuan to arrest Zhu and Lu.

<h3>Agricultural and Industrial Bank of China, Nanjing Branch - Business Director Embezzlement</h3>
<p>Sentenced to Imprisonment for One Year and Six Months</p>
<p>The Nanjing Branch of the Agricultural and Industrial Bank of China retreated to Shanghai after the outbreak of the August 13th Shanghai Battle. The head office discovered that Hu Xiaoquan (over forty years old), the business director of the branch and a native of Tianjin, had been continuously engaging in fraud before the war, embezzling more than 10,000 taels of public funds from the bank. The head office reported this to the French Concession police, and on May 7th of the 27th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1938], Hu was arrested by detectives and brought before the Special No. 2 Court. After questioning and detention, due to jurisdictional issues, a request was submitted to the Shanghai branch of the Supreme Court for designation. The Special No. 2 Court accepted the case for trial. The lawyer representing the administrative authorities of the French Concession prosecuted the defendant for embezzlement in business. Later, after auditing the accounts, it was found that the actual amount embezzled by Hu, after offsetting income and expenses, was short by more than 5,000 yuan. This case has been ongoing for more than a year. Judge Sun Pengxian has repeatedly held court hearings for investigation. Hu hired lawyers Wang Yuan and Gu to defend him. After deliberation, the case was concluded. Yesterday morning, Judge Sun announced the verdict, sentencing Hu Xiaoquan to one year and six months of imprisonment for continuous embezzlement.

<h3>Shanghai Children's Hospital - Reception for Child Welfare Organizations</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Children's Hospital at No. 65 Rue Molière held a tea party for the child welfare sector at 3:30 PM yesterday (the 26th).

First, Hospital Director Fu Wenshou reported on the hospital's operations, stating that the hospital was established in December of the 26th year of the Republic [i.e., 1937] and was originally named the Shanghai Refugee Children's Hospital. It was renamed the Shanghai Children's Hospital in June of the 28th year [i.e., 1939]. The hospital now has a total of 100 beds, of which 75 are free beds, donated by organizations such as the American Relief Association, the China International Famine Relief Commission, the Chinese Women's Association, the Rotary Club of Shanghai, and the German Community Association of Shanghai. The hospital has an X-ray machine, donated by the Li Yunshan family and friends, for examining the physical condition of sick children. The diet is completely controlled by dietetics experts, a first in Shanghai. Clothing is enthusiastically provided by the hospital's women's auxiliary, with donations reaching over 4,000 yuan. All major and minor surgeries are performed by expert physicians, striving to provide the best possible service to sick children. In the future, if any child welfare organizations send sick children, the hospital will do its best to accommodate them, but they must be responsible for taking them back quickly after they recover to avoid occupying beds and hindering other sick children. It is hoped that all child welfare organizations can fully understand and cooperate with each other. After Director Fu's report, representatives from various organizations raised questions and exchanged ideas. Finally, the hospital director led a tour of the various departments and facilities. The meeting adjourned at about 6:00 PM.</p>

<h3>Southern City - Thorns Everywhere - Gambling Flourishes, Robbers Run Rampant - Rumors of Increased Taxes on Gambling Dens in Western Shanghai</h3>
<p>Since the opening of the Southern City, a gang of gamblers from Western Shanghai has developed towards the Southern City, making it a second breeding ground for criminals. Those that opened before the Lunar New Year include the large gambling dens in Pinhua Lane on Anren Street near the City God Temple and the Tongbaotai at Jiumudi. Those that opened the day before yesterday include the Hengan gambling den in Hengan Lane near Nanyang Bridge, the Dafu Company at the old site of the Guandi Temple's Quanfu Restaurant near Laoximen, the Xingfa Company in Kongjia Lane, and the Xieli gambling den behind the Gonghe Cinema in Wengjia Lane. The Sanxing Company near Xinbeimen is scheduled to open soon. These are purely gambling establishments, offering games such as Twenty-One, Pai Gow, and Yaotan. They even have advertisements posted in front of the doors and hire female attendants and women to roll dice, using brothel-style methods and pornography to lure and extort money. In the past, those who worked as bouncers and were also robbers were rampant in Western Shanghai. Now, this group of criminals has followed the leaders of the gambling gangs into the Southern City, leading to frequent robbery cases. The Southern City has become a place full of thorns. It is also said that the gambling dens in Western Shanghai have jointly contributed 1.6 million yuan for supplies for another six months. Furthermore, it is rumored that the gambling dens in Western Shanghai will be closed at the end of this month. However, whether this will actually happen is attracting attention from both Chinese and foreigners. It is understood that the Japanese method of cracking down on gambling dens is to strictly order all gambling dens to triple the daily license fees they pay. If they cannot afford it, the Japanese will send military police to seal them up. Currently, business in the gambling dens in Western Shanghai is very sluggish. The weaker gambling dens are already showing signs of collapse. It is feared that more than a dozen will close down. It is heard that the gambling dens such as Dasheng Shenji in Xin Kang Lane are preparing to close down.</p>
<h3>Assassination Attempt on Ge Shusen - Gunman Captured After Being Shot - Prosecution for Attempted Murder After Recovery</h3>
<p>Ge Shusen, a native of Hubei, 58 years old, formerly worked in the Municipal Police Bureau. Ge resigned after the outbreak of the war and later became the chairman of the Western Shanghai Manufacturers Association. He lived at No. 4, Lane 913, Fuxu Road. At 9:50 AM on December 8th of last year, Ge was walking from his home to the intersection of Weihaiwei Road and Fuxu Road, waiting for a public bus when he was suddenly shot. The bullet hit Ge's buttocks. At that time, Western Deputy Police Chief Bryce and Western Third Road Patrolman Conway of the Jing'an Temple Police Station happened to be patrolling nearby. They heard the alert and helped chase after the attacker. The two sides exchanged fire, resulting in the arrest of Wang Sanxiao, a native of Jiangbei, who was the attacker. He was wounded in the neck. He, along with a Mauser rifle, four bullets, and two shell casings, were taken to the police station and sent to the hospital for treatment. Ge Shusen went to the Fumin Hospital for treatment himself. Now that Wang Sanxiao has recovered from his injuries, he was escorted to the First Special Court's Criminal Division No. 2 yesterday morning. The police, based on the fact that Wang resisted arrest at the time and opened fire to harm the Western police officer, prosecuted him for attempted murder in accordance with Article 271, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law. When questioned, Wang Sanxiao admitted that he was ordered by his captain to shoot Ge Shusen, but he only fired one shot because the bullet was jammed, so he did not continue firing. Judge Xiao announced the conclusion of the debate on the case and scheduled the verdict for March 1st.</p>

<h3>Finance - Foreign Exchange Supply and Demand Still Balanced</h3>

Trading was stagnant. The daily buying and selling opened flat, still at 4 shillings 1.5625 pence and 6.84375 yuan. The market was quiet afterwards. Although Sassoon's Hong Kong telegram and a certain American bank successively sold, foreign firms and Chinese banks bought, offsetting each other, so there was no impact. There was no improvement, and the market hovered until 3:00 PM, when a sudden buying interest from Lever Brothers and Belgian foreign banks caused the market to show a slight softening. By the evening close, British gold was only at 4 shillings 1.40625 pence, and American exchange was only at 6.8125 yuan, resulting in a slight increase of 0.015625 and 0.03125 compared to the end of last week. As the settlement date for February approaches, many speculators are posting bonds, so swap trading is booming. These are all bought by foreign banks such as HSBC. The price of US dollars is 0.09375, which is about 1.18% monthly interest. Among them, some banks once bought US dollars at 0.078125, which is about 1.15% monthly interest.</p>

By the evening close, British gold was at 4 shillings 1.40625 pence, and American exchange was at 6.8125 yuan. Next month's British gold was at 4 shillings 0.8375 pence, and American exchange was at 6.71875 yuan.

<h3>Small Changes in the Gold Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the black market situation for spot gold was small, with little fluctuation. Although the potential was tired in people's hearts, it did not fall. As a result, it rose by one yuan compared to the end of last week. This was due to the purchase by Hong Kong gangs and the securities firms buying after selling. The process of the day: the morning opening was flat and tired at 4,770 yuan, a decrease of 14 yuan, because securities firms sold. Then, a certain silver building bought on behalf of customers, and a certain silver company also bought on behalf of its own gang, rising by 11 yuan. However, securities firms intended to sell, and money changers also sold, falling to a low price of 4,763 yuan. Fortunately, retail investors bought at a low price, and certain securities firms also bought, turning the situation slightly. The noon close was 4,773 yuan. The afternoon was initially stable, but then Hong Kong gangs suddenly bought, and the British securities firms that had sold in the morning also returned, so it was once raised to 4,790 yuan. Buyers gradually lacked, slightly falling back. The evening close was 4,785 yuan. The entire day's trading was slightly weak, about 1,200 to 1,300 taels. The price of gold jewelry in silver buildings first fell and then rose, and finally remained flat. Customs gold was stable.</p>
<p>Spot Gold Only Increased by One Yuan</p>
<p>From the initial flat and tired opening, securities firms first sold, but buyers' appetite was not good, so the opening price was pressed down by 14 yuan. Securities firms sold 20 taels to gold shops for 4,770 yuan. Then, because a certain silver building bought on behalf of customers, and a certain company also bought on behalf of its own gang, the market situation once stabilized, rising by 11 yuan. A certain silver company bought 10 taels from money changers for 4,781 yuan. After that, securities firms, gold shops, and money changers sold again, and the buyers' appetite was full, so it fell again by 18 yuan. Securities firms sold 50 taels to silver building gangs for 4,763 yuan. Then, as there were fewer sellers, a certain money changer took the opportunity to buy low, and another securities firm also followed suit, so it rose again by 15 yuan. Money changers bought 30 taels from silver building gangs for 4,778 yuan. At noon, silver building gangs continued to sell, pressing down by another 5 yuan. Silver building gangs sold 50 taels to securities firms for 4,773 yuan, as the noon closing price. The afternoon opened slightly lower by one yuan, with silver building gangs selling 20 taels to a certain silver company for 4,772 yuan. Then, a certain silver building suddenly bought on behalf of a Hong Kong gang, and securities firms also suddenly returned, so it rose by 18 yuan. Securities firms bought 10 taels from money changers for 4,790 yuan. Afterwards, the buying stopped, and money changers sold, so it fell back by 7 yuan. Money changers sold 30 taels to securities firms for 4,783 yuan. At 3:00 PM, silver building gangs traded 50 taels among themselves for 4,785 yuan as the evening closing price.

<h3>Grain - Rumors of Imported Rice Fail - Prices Plummet</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rice market fell again sharply because the French Consul announced that the statement by the Annam Governor-General that the port of Haiphong was closed for rice was a rumor. Speculators found it difficult to sell and panicked. Some also sold their stock aggressively to escape. The fall reached as much as one yuan. Upon examination, the initial opening prices in the morning did not show an upward trend. However, sellers tried to hold on and were unwilling to sell easily. Later, hoarders withdrew on a large scale and sold aggressively, so sellers had to follow suit, resulting in a continuous decline. One-grade Saigon, which initially opened at 47.3 yuan, had already fallen by half a yuan and closed at only 46 yuan. Huowen fell from the initial opening of 45.6 yuan to 44 yuan. Other goods, except for mixed broken rice and goods at the bottom of the warehouse, which were slightly held up, fell by about one yuan, to 44.5 yuan and 44 yuan. The rest fell by more than two yuan compared to the previous market. Although the mid-day market for Tokyo rice was as low as 40.05 yuan, there were few transactions. Under these circumstances, the bottom line for glutinous rice was small, and it was difficult to maintain its price, falling by about 1.5 yuan. Jintan goods sold for 41 yuan, and Danyang goods ranged from 40.05 yuan to 39 yuan. Thick-grain, thin-grain, early rice, and late rice all fell.

Special thin rice was 46 yuan, and early and late rice were 44-45 yuan. The market was repeatedly weak, and the owners were eager to sell. Many goods were transferred from Hongkou to the concession, no less than 5,000 bags.</p>
<p>Imported Rice Arrives in Shanghai Again - The "Qiahe" ship of the Pacific Orient Line, which came from Haiphong, loaded 6,000 bags of imported rice there and 13,714 bags from Hong Kong, totaling 19,714 bags.

Also, the "Shunda" ship of the Taikoo Company sailed to North China, loaded with 3,000 bags of imported rice, which were transported to Yantai.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Firmly Strong, Wheat Market Turns Steady</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market was quietly strong. The quotation for No. 2 flour from the flour mill remained at ten yuan. The Fu and Fu flour mills limited their daily sales to 7,500 bags on this street and were unwilling to sell more. It is said that some of the machinery at the Fufeng Mill is damaged and under repair, so flour production has decreased rather than increased. Yesterday, the demand from the inland and merchant groups was relatively active, and the price of goods from the same place rose again due to favorable conditions. It is said that the old "Car Brand" forwarding orders opened at 14.75 yuan. The asking price for "Green Cannon Car" still requires 16 yuan, but no formal transaction has been made. In the market, rice shops sell No. 4 flour for 9.3 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat market also stabilized. After a sharp drop last week, sellers were unwilling to sell at lower prices. As a result, five to six carloads of Suzhou wheat were traded at the original price of 25.5 yuan, reportedly bought by Xiexin and other mills.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 25,000 bags of flour were shipped to Tianjin, handled by Japanese merchants. Also, 500 bags of corn were shipped to Yantai, 2,100 bags of beans were shipped to Hong Kong, and 200 bags of raw peanuts were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Securities: Speculation in Foreign Stocks Remains Strong, Domestic Stocks Exceptionally Dull</h3>
<p>The securities gray market saw a sudden shift to inactivity yesterday. Most firms were taking a wait-and-see approach. The situation improved slightly by one or two cents as short sellers made some cover purchases. The news was dull, and the atmosphere was quiet, but many parties, in view of the short covering, took the opportunity to increase their holdings, making the market relatively firm. With no changes in the environment, it may trend towards consolidation. This is because most large investors have shifted their funds to cotton yarn arbitrage, reportedly earning a monthly interest of more than three percent. The public bond market has become dull. Even yesterday's trading on the two exchanges was extremely limited, and the number of attendees was also sparse. Only the "Yi" and "Nei" bonds saw some trading; the rest had very few inquiries. As a result, prices continued to rise by 1.5 to 2.5 cents, with a total trading volume of no more than 300,000. A concise table is listed below.</p>
<p>In stock trading, 50 shares of the Zhonghua Book Company were traded at a price of 30.05 yuan, an increase of another 0.05 yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Stock Exchange saw a return to the usual firm and upward trend of Mondays. All stocks that were once highly regarded rose. Jardine Matheson shares fell after rising due to profit-taking, but eventually returned to 110 yuan. Ewo Cotton Mill shares rose strongly, reaching a high of 43 yuan at one point, closing at 42.25 yuan. Due to a drop in the price of raw rubber, demand for rubber shares was not strong, but prices remained stable.</p>
<p>In recent days, this newspaper has received many letters from readers regarding foreign stocks, with varying opinions. However, this newspaper's position is to never be biased. Therefore, whether the intentions of "Xin Wei" and "Xin An" are good or bad, we adopt their reasoning, eliminate their excesses, and allow readers to distinguish right from wrong. Impartial publication is for the sake of fairness. We have always opposed speculation, so we do not want to encourage people to speculate, nor do we want to show people how to speculate or inspire them with a desire to speculate. As for superficial writings, we do not adopt them. Only by not having speculative thoughts can one be truly fair. Therefore, we hope that those without true insights will not waste ink on speculative views. Furthermore, the Shanghai Stock Exchange's news is released by the exchange itself, naturally with the exchange's interests as a priority, so please pay attention to their statements.</p>
<h3>American China Securities Dividend</h3>
<p>The American China Securities Company decided at a board meeting yesterday to distribute a cash dividend on March 12 at an annual interest rate of 6%. Part of this dividend is a special dividend. In accordance with the US China Trade Act, part of the common stock dividend should be distributed according to the shareholder register on December 31, 1939, and the other part according to the shareholder register on March 8, 1940.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Profit-Taking Emerges, Yarn Prices Fall Slightly</h3>
<p>The yarn market has stabilized somewhat, but the actual demand in South China and inland areas is gradually showing signs of growth. However, due to the approach of the end of the month for February futures, profit-takers are actively closing out positions, causing the market to loosen slightly. At the same time, although the exchange rate is firm, there have been no major changes. Gold is slightly weak, and sentiment is mediocre, making the market slightly sluggish. However, the raw cotton situation is extremely strong, making it difficult for factories to reduce costs.</p>
<p>The opening market for current yarn was quiet this morning. At the same time, the exchange rate remained firm. The asking price for 20-count Shuang Ma yarn was 864 yuan, and the price for March futures was 883 yuan. Shortly after, the market turned weak due to an increase in profit-takers and arbitrageurs, and prices fell slightly. The March futures price fell to 875 yuan, and the February price was 858 yuan. However, large investors returned to buy at this price, and the market stabilized. According to half-day transaction statistics, 2,325 bales were traded. The price of 20-count Shuang Ma yarn was down 5.5 yuan. Yesterday, 415 pieces of yarn were shipped to Siam, 16 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong, 160 pieces were shipped to Xiamen, and 85 pieces were shipped to Tianjin. The amount bought by each merchant group is as follows:</p>
<h3>Cotton Trading: Mostly Among Dealers, Market Remains Strong</h3>
<p>Cotton trading remains strong, mostly among dealers buying and selling among themselves. Factories, both Japanese and British, only make occasional purchases. Sentiment is particularly bullish, and the market is firm. Tonghua cotton remains at 203 yuan, and 42-count raw material Metre cotton is priced at 260 yuan. 1,750 bales of Tonghua cotton from Subei have arrived. Yesterday, 60 bales of cotton were shipped to Hong Kong and 10 bales were shipped to Saigon. The current cotton situation is listed on the left.</p>
<p>In other news, the price of foreign cotton is as follows: The New York cotton market opened very strong this morning. Prices rose first due to speculative buying, and then due to buying by dealers and overseas cotton merchants, as well as some short covering. As a result, closing prices were up 5-6 points to more than 10 points compared to the previous day. Indian cotton, including forecasts, rose by more than two rupees, and Egyptian cotton rose by 5-6 points.</p>
<p>The Shanghai foreign cotton market has been quite good recently. However, due to the approach of the end of the month, funds are tighter, so trading is slightly sluggish. Factories have consistently adopted a wait-and-see attitude. The activity of the cotton market relies solely on dealers. The following is the price of US Mer cotton at 6.8125 yuan converted for delivery to the factory:</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Soybean Oil Rises by One Yuan, Raw Oil Sales Stagnant and Prices Continue to Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the soybean oil market was unremarkable in the morning session due to average sentiment among buyers and sellers. After entering the session, transactions increased, and the market became lively, but its scope was narrow, and there was no opportunity for manipulation. Sentiment was still not excited, so the price was slightly higher than last weekend by one yuan. According to statistics, 150 barrels of Dalian crude oil were traded at a price of 115-116 yuan, 20 barrels of Hankou oil were traded at a price of 114 yuan, 12 barrels of Bengbu oil were traded at a price of 113.5 yuan, 100 dan of Dayou factory oil were traded at a price of 91 yuan, and 50 dan of Pudong Changde factory oil (operated by Japanese merchants) were traded at a price of 88.5 yuan. Peanut oil prices continued to fall because of the lack of activity from merchants in Hong Kong. Only 50 barrels of Qingdao oil were traded at a price of 115 yuan.</p>
<h3>Coal: Processed Coal Also Subject to Monopoly, Gray Market Price Rises Sharply by Sixty Yuan</h3>
<p>The price of processed coal usually fluctuates with the price of coal balls. In January, the market price was only 90 yuan, but recently, under the pretext of rising bituminous coal prices and related costs, the price has increased by 60 yuan per ton, driving up the price of coal balls. In reality, this is due to sellers hoarding and speculating, intentionally monopolizing the market and unwilling to sell easily, leading to a surge in the gray market. The asking price for lump coal is 150 yuan per ton, and medium lump coal is 140 yuan per ton, delivered to customers, with an additional handling fee. It is said that a certain processed coal dealer in the city is stockpiling large quantities of coal and unwilling to sell, further driving up the market price.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Raw and White Sugar Prices Rebound</h3>
<p>Yesterday, according to Dutch telegraphs, the production price of raw white sugar, according to C.I.F.C.I. standards, was 6.12 Dutch guilders. According to Hong Kong telegraphs, the price of Taikoo factory B mark sugar was 15.25 Hong Kong dollars. The Shanghai Sugar Association's quoted price rebounded due to increased demand. The current price for (1) 4-group white sugar from the main warehouse was 61.2 yuan, up 0.4 yuan. Newly arrived sugar from other warehouses was initially 61.5 yuan, then 61.2 yuan, up 0.5 yuan. Old sugar was 61-60.5 yuan, up 0.9-0.4 yuan. Taikoo car white sugar rose by 1 yuan. West warehouse B mark sugar was 64 yuan, CW mark sugar was 63.5 yuan, and other prices did not fluctuate much, such as CX mark sugar at 62 yuan, DY mark sugar at 61 yuan, and HX mark sugar at 60.8 yuan. East warehouse sugar fell by 0.5-0.2 yuan. Dutch red car sugar and red sugar saw no change. Mupian white sugar rose by 0.5 yuan, and snow white sugar was 61 yuan. The price of local rock sugar rose similarly, with No. 1 sugar at 74 yuan and crystal clear rock sugar at 75.5 yuan. A Jian merchant opened at 46.5 yuan for 350 bags of Diaoqing sugar produced domestically. A Xinghua merchant opened at 58.2 yuan for 50+ bags of Dagong flour. 2,000 bags of sugar arrived from Holland on the 26th, and 2,700 bags were shipped to Tianjin on the same day.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: User Silk Transactions Begin</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Yokohama silk prices were stable. The morning spot price was 1630 yuan, and the afternoon closing price was 1625 yuan, a fluctuation of only 5 yuan. The near-term price was 1621 yuan, up 17 yuan, and the far-term price was 1611 yuan, up 20 yuan. The afternoon closing price was 1609 yuan, down 2 yuan. In the local silk market, a white factory sold 10 dan of B-grade Xinfu silk at 4950 yuan, and a Ji Li silk merchant sold 2520 yuan for secondary brands and 20 dan sold by Dachang at 30 yuan less than the previous price. There have been sporadic transactions of user white factory silk recently, as demand for spring silk is already active.</p>
<p>The green tea market remains sluggish. European firms are gradually listing Hong Kong red and green teas. Many tea masters have gone to X to purchase goods, and Shanghai tea prices are high, and the quality is inferior, so sales are very poor. Yesterday, only Anhe Shilong and other firms purchased over 110 boxes of green tea such as Zhenmei and Xizhen. Zhenmei sold for 265 yuan, and Xizhen sold for 98 yuan. Prices were 5-6 to 10 yuan lower than before.</p>
<p>Fujian tea has been arriving for several days. Yesterday, 5,000 pieces were shipped to Dajin, 34 pieces of Ningbo tea were shipped to Xiamen, and 175 pieces of tea were shipped to Hong Kong (annual).</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth Spring Sales Are Starting Up Again</h3>
<p>Light-colored fine yarn woven products are selling quite well, and the market is firm, as spring sales have begun. However, the cost of natural-colored gray cloth has increased due to dyeing and finishing factories raising their processing fees, making them more expensive than finished goods on the market, so demand is gradually weakening. The selling price has no power to rise. Jardine Matheson's coarse cloth prices continue to rise. 16-pound group cloths are becoming scarce on the market, and the price of each brand has increased by 0.25 yuan. The retail prices of fine cloth and twill are slightly loose due to month-end payments and tight credit. Transactions are most active on this street, with sales to Wenzhou, Guangdong, Hong Kong, northern Anhui, and Nanyang merchants being the most robust, totaling over 1,000 pieces.</p>
<p>Eastern cloth was weak in the morning and strong in the afternoon, trending towards stability. The spot price of white cotton leading fine cloth fell to 16.45 yuan per piece in the morning, but then rose again due to purchases from Qinhuangdao merchants, closing at 26.6 yuan. Four Gentlemen twill is currently priced at 0.7875 yuan per yard, while next month's futures still require 0.8275 yuan.</p>
<p>Exports: Piece goods exports on the 26th included 125 pieces shipped to Tianjin, 199 pieces shipped to Xiamen, and 230 pieces shipped to Siam.</p>
<h3>Yuanzhi Tribute Goods are Rare and Expensive</h3>
<p>Yuanqing Tribute flannel is quite scarce in the market, and the sales target is the shoe merchant group. The colors are mostly Huaxin, Chunhe, and Yong. It is difficult to order goods, and the general market price is soaring. Yesterday, the market price for Lihe 10630 was 22 yuan per yard, Lu Lin 1868 sold for 18.5 yuan, 5885 sold for 23 yuan, Hengli 7131 sold for 24 yuan, Yinfeng 201 sold for 19 yuan, Hunter Sheng 2376 sold for 21.5 yuan, Xiexin 3000 sold for 17.5 yuan, Donghuo 10000 sold for 16.5 yuan, and 559 Sima Xiangru sold for 14 yuan.</p>
<h3>Dried and Fresh Goods: Black Melon Seeds Tighten</h3>
<p>Due to the thin arrival of black melon seed orders, they have gradually increased since the Hong Kong X. According to the overall market inventory, Dalian seeds are the most numerous, about 10 carloads. The rest are only scattered. The production price of Dalian seeds has risen repeatedly, and the difference between the Shanghai market and the Dalian market is more than 10 yuan. Therefore, the last batch is difficult to come again. As a result, it is particularly tight. Yesterday's market price was 70 yuan for Jikui seeds, 67-65 yuan for Xukui seeds, 65 yuan for Tongcheng seeds, 60 yuan for Mingguang seeds, and 58 yuan for Dalian seeds.</p>
<h3>Hardware: Light Demand for Round Bars</h3>
<p>New round bar transactions are most active among nail factories on this street (since they are the raw material for local nails). However, recently, due to weakening sales of local nails, nail factories are less busy, leading to reduced demand for new round bars. The market is stagnant, sentiment is weakening, and prices have fallen by 2 yuan. The current market price is around 49 yuan per dan. Yesterday's market only traded 170-180 dan. Only merchants in Yantai made occasional purchases.</p>

<h3>The Freedom to Starve</h3>
<p>— Jia</p>
<p>The other day, a homeless Russian woman, driven by hunger and cold, had a whimsical idea. She ran to the French Concession police station and asked to be imprisoned. The people at the police station refused her request because she had not committed a crime. Helpless, she said she was a heroin addict. The people at the police station didn't believe her and drove her away. She had no choice but to leave in disappointment.</p>
<p>Because the problem of food and housing was not solved, she came up with a clever plan. She chose a bakery and broke the large glass window. As a result, she finally achieved her goal and entered prison with a happy smile.</p>
<p>From the perspective of another society, this is a small, humorous, and sad fact. When readers see this piece of social news, their eyes must be filled with tears, and a faint, heartfelt smile must be on their lips.</p>
<p>After this Russian woman was arrested, I don't know what crime the judge will sentence her for or what punishment he will impose on her. A fine? That would certainly be like trying to climb a tree to catch a fish. Imprisonment? In her eyes, that would be solving the problem of food and lodging, which is exactly what she was seeking. In such cases, the law is merely a formality.</p>
<p>Here, the current society reveals an unhideable major flaw.</p>
<p>"Give me liberty, or give me death!" This famous saying does not seem to apply here. In fact, there is nothing wrong with the saying itself. The Russian woman who asked to be imprisoned was not trying to exchange her freedom for a full stomach. She was escaping another kind of freedom, a terrible freedom—the "freedom to starve" that the current society had given her!</p>

<h3>The Anti-War Movement of American Students</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>Today, as war is approaching, authorities in various countries, in addition to actively preparing for war, are also intensifying military training for the youth of the country. But despite the enthusiastic efforts of authorities in various countries to prepare for war, the anti-war mentality of students in general is growing, especially among American university students. They have even expanded their aversion to war into large-scale actions.</p>
<p>According to recent surveys, most of the young people detained in American prisons in a year are there because they participated in anti-war demonstrations, and relatively few are there because of personal misconduct.</p>
<p>In the United States, according to the votes of more than 22,600 students from 65 universities, 8,938 votes indicated an absolute refusal to participate in any international war; more than 7,300 votes indicated that they would only be willing to fight in order to defend the territory of the United States; and only a very small number were willing to unconditionally obey the national mobilization order. The motives for students' anti-war sentiment may be due to religious beliefs or support for the League of Nations, but the most dominant factor influencing this anti-war sentiment seems to be "skepticism about war." This can be proven by looking at the anti-war publications or leaflets from American universities in the past few years. They all share the same suspicion: war is a competition for profits among the elderly, and young people are just used as cannon fodder. They also hate aggressors the most and are very sympathetic to the weak.</p>
<p>Various anti-war articles often appear in American student publications, calling out loudly and sharply to awaken the anti-war ideas of students across the country. For example: "Don't hesitate anymore: munitions merchants, along with industrial and economic interests, are preparing for another brutal showdown to decide who will rule the world's markets... Students, what is our answer to this conspiracy? If we are determined, we can stop the war. We should work early. They also made countless banners, writing on them!" "Abolish R.O.T.C!" (Reserve Officers' Training Corps) Refuse to cooperate with the government to participate in any war!"</p>
<p>As for the extent to which the American students' anti-war movement has spread now, it is difficult to say. Judging from the situation in the past few years, broadly speaking, this sentiment is strongest in the eastern United States, with its stronghold often in urban schools. To date, American student anti-war organizations include the following:</p>
<p>(1) Student League for Industrial Democracy (2) National Student League. In addition to "anti-war," the goals of these two also include opposing unequal treatment of black students and other educational issues. The former was established earlier, and now has more than 100 branches in universities and publishes a monthly magazine called "Student Outlook." The latter has been established for eight years and publishes a monthly magazine called "Student Review." (3) American Anti-War and Anti-Fascist League. This organization, along with the above two, forms the left wing of the peace movement in American universities. It publishes a monthly magazine called "The Battle." (4) Green International. This is an international student organization whose members all wear green shirts. Its presence in the United States is not large, but it has branches in universities such as "Wisconsin," "Paris," "Imperial," and "Oxford." Its main goal is to oppose aggressive armament.</p>

<h3>Scientific Predictions</h3>
<p>— Zhi Hui</p>
<p>Edison's Predictions</p>
<p>Thirty-two years ago, the great American scientist Edison answered many questions from a New York Times reporter. Those answers became invaluable predictions about the future world at that time.</p>
<p>His predictions were, of course, entirely about science. They were:</p>
<p>1. The golden age of steel-reinforced concrete buildings.</p>
<p>2. The invention of sound films with dialogue.</p>
<p>3. Railway electrification.</p>
<p>4. The invention of electrolytic nitrogen fertilizer.</p>
<p>5. The development of water mill constitutions.</p>
<p>6. The success of the aviation industry, especially the postal aviation industry.</p>
<p>7. Serums have discovered unexpected effects on human health, extending life.</p>
<p>8. There are often discoveries and methods of natural forces, so new things that have never been experienced often appear.</p>
<p>9. The use of coal is greatly expanded.</p>
<p>The above is an outstanding record from the New York Times in 1908. Looking at it today, almost all of Edison's great predictions have been fulfilled. Items 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 9 are obvious facts. Items 4 and 7 are also not far from completion. As for the eighth item, and the new things created by nature, they are countless. Isn't the Rainbow lamp one of the most wonderful things that makes use of natural action?</p>
<p>Future Predictions</p>
<p>The great Edison has already left the crowd, so what will the scientific progress be like in the next thirty years? Edison can no longer tell us. Now let's listen to the predictions of Professor Farnese (C.C. Farnese) of Yale University in the United States:</p>
<p>1. Three-dimensional buildings will increase.</p>
<p>2. The popularity of residential ventilation equipment (such as heating and air conditioning).</p>
<p>3. The use of radio transmission (also known as television) will increase.</p>
<p>4. The methods of using agricultural products in industry will increase.</p>
<p>5. The textile industry will be greatly changed due to the invention of some new fiber.</p>
<p>6. The use of light metals (such as aluminum and nickel) will be infinitely expanded.</p>
<p>7. The invention of a panacea.</p>
<p>8. The adjustment of food production, that is, to produce in large quantities what is most beneficial to the human body, and reduce the production of secondary products.</p>
<p>9. The progress of human life science and the extension of life.</p>
<p>10. The increased use of plastic materials (such as metal).</p>
<p>If the above ten predictions can be realized one by one, then our world thirty years from now will indeed have a different view.</p>
<p>Cultivation</p>
<h3>Cultivating Interests in Life</h3>
<p>— Yang Tongfang</p>
<p>Chinese people are often not good at utilizing their leisure time, lacking hobbies that foster physical and mental development. This is especially true for young working adults who, unable to find suitable pastimes during their time off, feel bored and empty. As for those who are unwilling to be "idle," they pursue highly stimulating sights and sounds, wasting valuable time on unhealthy habits that harm their well-being, which is truly regrettable.</p>
<p>According to psychological research, if a person cannot channel their surplus energy in appropriate directions, their physical and mental health will not develop properly. Utilizing leisure time and cultivating hobbies can not only provide proper balance in our lives, preventing boredom and emptiness, but also strengthen our belief in life, enrich its meaning, and expand our experiences. The achievements of many inventors and artists stem from their skillful use of leisure time and the cultivation of interests; this is certainly not without reason.</p>
<p>Therefore, the "interests in life" discussed here are very broad, encompassing any beneficial physical and mental activities outside of work. We can all cultivate these interests according to our inclinations, such as literature, art, painting, music, sculpture, travel, and sports. The value of these interests should surpass ordinary recreation; they can enlighten personality and cultivate virtue. When we feel that these interests are inseparable from life, we will deeply understand the importance of using leisure time to cultivate them.</p>
<p>The physical health and mental vitality of Westerners fully demonstrate their love for hobbies. They readily participate in activities like travel, swimming, boating, and skating, regarding them as essential interests in life. Even in terms of reading newspapers and magazines, Chinese people would rather abandon this valuable spiritual food and waste time and energy on gambling, which is a clear example of neglecting interests in life.</p>
<p>I hope that those who spend their time in listless and frivolous amusements will wake up early and seek meaningful and valuable interests in life!</p>
<h3>"Package"</h3>
<p>— Li Li</p>
<p>When life is mentioned, everyone thinks of walking, a very familiar analogy. But, some people remember they are walking when they take a step, while others forget.</p>
<p>May I ask, where are you going on your vast journey? East? West? South? North? A casual question is enough to leave you bewildered for a while.</p>
<p>The road of life is not a paved road. You cannot wander aimlessly. You should pack your bags, shoulder the package of hope, and pursue your journey.</p>
<p>The heavy little package presses on your back, alerting you and urging you on. Thus, you will no longer lose your way, nor will you be bewildered by having nowhere to return.</p>
<p>Remember to grab a heavy package, not a light one. But, where is your package?</p>

<h3>Hollywood Gleanings</h3>
<p>— Qiu Wen</p>
<p>Charlie Chaplin's new film "The Great Dictator," after more than two years of painstaking production, was finally completed last month. It is now learned that the new work to be produced in succession has been decided to be based on the original work "Liberty Bell" by the great British writer, Curt Frick. The story of the film narrates the historical events of the Indian nation's resistance against the British invasion in 1877 and will still be carefully adapted by Loren Full, the screenwriter of "The Great Dictator." However, in order for Mr. Che to understand the actual situation of the country depicted in the play and the human geography of the Indian nation, he has decided to personally conduct an on-site inspection of the country. It is learned that Mr. Zhu has prepared his luggage and is expected to leave for India within a month. In addition to Loren Full, the accompanying team includes several people, including the great director Hinlo Peyhoton. However, his wife, Pauline Goddard, has decided not to travel with him again because the company still has several films that need to be produced urgently.</p>
<p>The ethical family film "The Great Wall" produced by the former China United Film Company, after being released in the United States in 1935, was warmly praised by the people of the country. Recently, due to the request of the majority of American audiences, it was given a second public screening at the Satorer Theatre in New York starting on the 12th of last month. The screening period was originally set for four days, but due to the booming box office, it was extended to eight days. It is also heard that the theater, in view of the fact that China is currently in a period of resistance against the war, has automatically remitted half of the ticket revenue to the Chinese government for use as medical expenses for the wounded soldiers.</p>
<p>Deanna Durbin's seventh work after "First Love," "Spring Parade," has been completed and is expected to be released in China around February.</p>
<p>Clark Gable and his wife Carole Lombard, who had been missing for more than two months, safely returned to Hollywood on the evening of January 14. Major newspapers and weekly magazines have not disclosed the course of their disappearance. It is reported that the reason is that Clark and others are unwilling to report on the mysterious journey.</p>
<p>China's 24th anti-Japanese war news film "The Great Victory of Northern Guangdong" was successively premiered in New York, London, and Paris last month. The film is 1,900 feet long and lasts for 35 minutes. After the film was released, newspapers from various countries unanimously gave it positive reviews.</p>
<h3>Returning from Beyond the Great Wall – Mongolian Photography Memoirs (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Yao Shiquan (Chongqing Aviation News)</p>
<p>At this time, many lamas, both senior and junior, were welcoming us at the "Lamasery Temple," with large lanterns made of white paper hanging everywhere. Seeing this unusual scene in the vast, dark desert, it felt as if we had arrived in another world. Drums were beating loudly, creating a deafening noise. Guards stood in rows, exuding an imposing presence. They ushered us into the temple, where everyone sat cross-legged on large pits padded with velvet carpets, with butter lamps burning on all four walls. In the center of the pit, there was a long seat like a throne in a palace. Group Leader Wei and King Kang sat in the center, while many of us sat on both sides. The atmosphere was extremely solemn. King Kang specially prepared a Mongolian dinner to entertain us, with utensils made of ancient bronze. The walls around us were painted with classical murals, with red pillars, green tiles, and gilded carvings, exuding magnificence everywhere. The antique and elegant atmosphere made us feel as if we had entered another beautiful world...</p>
<p>When I woke up early in the morning, the red sun was already shining through the Mongolian patterned window lattices. Several red-robed lamas came in, carrying a brass pot and several small copper basins. At first, we didn't know what they were for. Later, the old lama who could speak Chinese told us that they were washing utensils. Breakfast was buttered fried rice. One pound of butter was extracted from fifty pounds of cream. This precious cream was specially made for the King. In the morning, King Kang ordered an alarm to be sounded, and the Mongolian strongmen, cavalry, and self-defense forces from all sides quickly gathered in front of the "Lamasery Temple." King Kang began the review, and the photographic work of the past few days was completed very successfully. In the evening, King Kang convened a grand evening party in a large Mongolian yurt. After everyone sang the national anthem together, the entertainment program began. Mongolian female comrades sang anti-Japanese war songs and various Mongolian folk songs. Finally, everyone sang the March of the Volunteers together. After three rounds of wine and eating the whole sheep, King Kang gave a generous and impassioned speech, denouncing the conspiracies and cruelty of Japanese imperialism, hoping that all ethnic groups in the country would not be exploited by the enemy. He stressed the importance of unity under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, completing the great task of resisting the Japanese and building the nation. He also recalled the conspiracy of the Manchu Qing government to poison Mongolia, so he actively advocated abolishing the lama system. All those under the age of forty should return to secular life to become strong men, and the monarchy should be abolished, and the wearing of official hats and robes, and all kneeling ceremonies, should be prohibited... Finally, King Kang smiled at us and said, "Please don't call me King Kang in feudal terms anymore. I am the commander of the anti-Japanese army of the 'Dalate Banner' appointed by the National Government..."</p>
<p>As I embarked on the journey to Qinghai, the memories in my mind made it impossible to forget the photography in Mongolia!</p>
<h3>A Bloody Record of the Golden Palace</h3>
<p>— Qi Hua</p>
<p>Handling historical dramas, especially complex ones like "A Bloody Record of the Golden Palace," often results in missing important details or simply being overly verbose in introducing the story without proper editing and careful scripting. Although the director of "A Bloody Record of the Golden Palace" used the clever technique of moving puppets representing those close to the throne to depict the cruel methods of fratricide, nephew killing, and conspiracy to usurp the throne, this trickery cannot hide the flaws in the script, preventing many important scenes from being fully developed and turning them into filler scenes, which is a great pity. As for individual scenes, such as Li Que inciting Edward to imprison John; Li Que's acquisition of Anne; and the murder of Clarence, they are all handled very well.</p>
<p>Basil Rathbone's portrayal of Li Que already benefits from his facial features, and his clever use of his eyes is even more successful. For example, in the three cases mentioned above, when imprisoning John, he raised his head, and his eyes flickered open and closed. When acquiring Anne and begging Edward for forgiveness, his pupils darted and swirled. When drinking with Clarence, his eyes were wooden and motionless. These eye movements all helped to portray Li Que's insidious treachery. The other actors playing Edward IV, Clarence, and Elizabeth are all well-rounded. Karloff, apart from utilizing his facial makeup, did not portray the fierceness of Mute's henchman.</p>
<p>The two war scenes are tightly woven together. War scenes in domestic films are often clueless, especially when using ancient weapons. This should be a good example.</p>

<p>A Certain Female Performer Falls to Her Death (Part 1)</p>
<p>More than a decade ago, many southern female performers gathered at the Old Co-Dance Stage on the French Avenue. At that time, the opera "Hongbi Yuan" was all the rage. A certain female performer played the leading role of Luo Hongxun in the play. Her appearance was beautiful, and her singing style was novel. She was most skilled in singing long passages of the "running board" style. Although she was a female performer, her voice was broad and thick, and she often used soft and charming tones to please the audience. Therefore, at that time, the audience all praised her. The Baidai Company had recorded several of her records, which were popular throughout the country for several years. It is said that no matter what famous performer's records were in the company, none of them sold as well or made as much profit as the records of that certain female performer. Later, the American company Victory set up a factory in Shanghai. After receiving reports from various branches in the north and south, they all said that the sales of a certain female performer's records were high. The Westerners in the company, of course, prioritized business, so they focused on inviting a certain female performer to record. However, at that time, she had retired from the music scene for nearly ten years and did not often interact with outsiders. Later, it was only by inquiring about her old qin master that they learned about her recent difficult situation. If the company could offer a substantial price, she could discuss it with her family. One reason would be to leave more memories, and the second would be to obtain thousands of yuan in income, which would provide some relief to her long-deficient family. After two contacts, the agreement was settled. However, it was the height of summer (normally, recording is best in spring, followed by autumn, and never in summer or winter. However, the company, with its new factory completed, was eager to test the quality of the machines and the technology of the new engineers, so it ventured to do so). The recording studio was filled with sweat, so that each recording had to be re-recorded several times before a pair of wax discs could be selected. One day, only the first section of "Zhanzi" was recorded, and it was already late. It was agreed that she would come early the next day to continue recording the second, third, and fourth sections. But the next day was even hotter. The engineers and others waited in the recording studio from 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM, but that certain female performer had not yet arrived. Foreigners valued credit the most, and their faces immediately showed displeasure. At the same time, they prepared to put away the machines and wax discs and stop recording. (186)</p>
