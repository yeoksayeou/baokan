<p>倫敦　英官方宣稱、　渠等對於法國貝當上將在無綫電廣播中宣布法國放棄對德作戰事、不作批評、貝當上將發表宣言之前一小時、英遠征軍與法軍猶在諾曼第前綫作戰、以抗德軍、（十七日路透電）</p>
<p>波爾多港　新內閣頃於今晨十時舉行會議、并發表公報稱、「政府爲事勢所迫、業已有所決定、」內閣總理貝當上將、旋即向全國人民發表廣播說、略謂、「余會於昨日致書敵人、詢其能否與余相見、一如士兵兩名、在戰後用光榮的態度、覓致媾和途徑、」（十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>紐約　據國民廣播公司消息、法國新總理貝當上將已宣布對德投降、國民廣播公司會收得貝當上將之電文如下、「昨晚余會德司令部接洽、余茲沉痛布吾人已停止敵對行爲矣」、此間　員當上將在其廣播宣言時會謂、法國將　續在菲洲與東奮鬥、（十七日路透電）</p>

<p>柏林　法国莱诺氏「战争內閣」自　職、此間德國塲頃發出批評、謂「法國陸軍已大權在握」、渠等回憶一九一八年德國像協約國之降服、乃德國陸軍發動者、然此間觀察家對於以貝當大將爲首之法國政府、是否將向德國乞和一節、並不敢妄為推測、此種波爾多方面之請求必將先向身在前綫之希特勒元首提出、德國方面則始終對其所聲敢之國家要求無條件之投降、此間觀察家之分析、謂英國乃「德國之真正敵人」、因此德國向法國所提之和平條件、必較向英國所提者爲和緩、（十七日合衆電）</p>
<h3>貝當衷告國民　戰爭必須終止</h3>
<p>波爾多　貝當總理向法全國民衆廣播云、「法蘭西同胞乎、余應總統之　請、已自今日起擔任指揮法國政府之責矣、我可敬之陸軍、英勇作戰、受傷斷肢者、必予愛戴、余敢決陸軍在此光明磊落之抗戰期內、已　行吾人對協約國之職責矣、余敢決余以統率彼　自豪之退伍戰士必予輔助、又敢決全國必予信任、余今已委身於法蘭西、以期減輕其炎厄、法國人民團集於政府之左右、余在此艱苦試驗之時間中已任政府之主席矣、彼　應自仰悲痛、而唯爲　信其國家之命運、舍此而外、無所服從、余今以已碎之心告知爾等、戰事必須終止、昨夕余親自致書敵方、詢問願否以軍人作光榮戰鬥後之相見禮與余會談、否取終止敵對行爲之途徑、余念及彼忠守其舊日軍人傳統、以與人數遠逾彼等之敵軍對抗之諸戰士、余並念及上次大戰中余所統率之老戰友、余在此嚴重之一時已委身於法蘭西、以求改善其境遇、此際余更念及不幸之男婦避難人民、爲戰爭之慘禍所迫、枼其蔗舍、车达颠沛道中、余願向彼等表示至誠摯之同情國愛憐、（十七日路透電）</p>
<h3>弗朗哥將出任　和平談判調人</h3>

<h3>英國對法諒解　勢將單獨作戰</h3>
<p>倫敦　目前雖尚無官方言論發表、惟一般人皆信英國將軍獨繼續作戰、昨晚負責方面所發決心戰爭到底之宣言、將仍有效、該宣言之措辭、係謂「英國堅毅決心繼續奮鬥、已不能再作更清楚及切實之聲明」云、</p>
<p>此間人士皆以堅強決心應付法軍投降之消息、對於法國皆不加譴責、承認法國此項決定、係在厭迫之環境下爲之、一般人對於未來之局勢、自不免粉作推測、許多觀察家以爲德國之第二步行動將爲和平攻勢、或假手若干中立居間人亦未可知、（十七日路透電）</p>
<p>倫敦　關於法國所能希望於德國之和平條件、將爲何種性質、此間尚無所知、此間人士皆冀法國之海軍、仍將繼續戰爭、緣法國乃世界第二之最大海軍國也、一般人並稱、若德法義三國之海軍聯成一氣、則央國將於海上遭受一極嚴重之威脅更使德國易於發動一迅速攻擊英倫之舉、英國現在已爲一國敵德義兩國、已臨於一可怕之戰爭事業、除美國之物質援助外已毫無其奧援矣、聞法國投降、半由於美總統羅斯福致法前總理萊諾答語之內容所致、蓋法國軍事情勢、已陷於非常失望之境、茍美國能直接採取大規模之軍事干涉、方可使法國政府繼續抵抗德軍、（十七日合衆電）</p>
<p>倫敦　據央報界頃稱、法國雖已投降、央國本部及央帝國全部仍將繼續與　義戰爭、聞英政府對法國停止戰爭之決定、將發表詳細文告、以闡明英國之地位、該文告今晚可宣佈、（十七日合衆）</p>
<p>波爾多港　據官方消息、英國軍隊現正源源開抵前綫作戰、携有坦克車隊配備完全、（十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>停戰消息傳播　猶如晴天霹靂</h3>
<p>倫敦　上次歐戰以守衛凡爾等砲囊馳譽於世之法國八十四齡老英雄貝當上將在自一八七〇年以還法國最嘿黯之一時就總　職後未及二十四小時、今　突　廣播宣言、謂法蘭西已向德國發廣播宣言、謂法蘭西已向德國投降矣、今日外間雖猜度新政之法政府將作重大之決議、但初不料法國　有此一舉、故衆聞貝當上將之宣言、猶晴天之霹靂焉、此間無綫電收音機曾收得貝當上將之播音曰「吾人必須罷戰、吾人已以光榮之和平請於敵方矣」今晚此間尚未能由其他方面獲得官方徴實消息、紐約曾傳來急訊、謂國民廣播公司曾收得貝當上將播音中宣布法國降服德國之言曰「余已於夜與德軍總司令通訊、余沉痛宣布吾人已停止敵對行爲、」貝當上將播音前一小時、此間得悉德軍已進抵瑞士邊界、法軍破壞馬奇諾防綫重要工事後、已撤離該防綫、又聞巴黎區之　軍已向巴黎西南前進白哩、已在　日中馳往法國之英軍、現處何地位、未能得悉、惟在貝當上將播音前一小時、此聞猶聞央軍正在諾曼第與法軍駢肩作戰也、（十七日路透電）</p>
<p>紐約　法軍投降之最初消息傳來後、美國民衆甚爲震動、一般人對於法國之嚴重情形、雖已日趨明瞭、但料其採取此項步驟者、爲數甚少、美人多以戰事初期未能多予協約國以援助爲憾、目下主要推測事件之一、即爲法國艦隊之前途、倘使英國繼續單獨作戰、則此強大艦隊之遭遇如何、殊有重大之關係也、（十七日路透電）</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>歐戰急轉直下矣！</h3>
<p>法國萊諾內閣總辭職，破例的由軍人貝當將軍繼任內閣總理，此外閣員有如副總理魏剛，陸軍部長高爾松，海軍部長達蘭，空軍部長普雄，國方部長古爾森，皆是軍人中之佼佼者。當此強敵厭境，國家危亡的時候，法國全國的當前急務，自然是如何應付對外對內一切問題。在這樣情形下，由軍人掌政，自然是意中事。不過有一點可注意者，法國總統選任內閣總理，應由兩院議員擔任：海空軍部長，雖可屬之軍人，外長雖可界予行政官使，不一定是國會議員，但國務總理一席，却非議會多數黨的領袖莫屬；今由貝當上將爲總理，真是政致上的一種演化，亦是法國第三共和成立以來的特殊變例。法國政情，向稱複雜，政當林立，政見錯綜；較多數的一黨既不夠控制議會，於是組織內閣，也每每山數黨聯合血成。因此之故，任何內閣的政策，亦未能山一黨獨行其是，而輒折衷數黨的政禍。內閣行動因此不能十分堅定而一致，且內閣壽命因此不能持久；這兩種現象，在平時的影響自然較小，而在戰時則不免感覺其不健全。這在需要舉國一致對外的時候，自然已各黨加強團結爲先務，站在同一旗幟之下，應付艱危；往年的克里猛梭內閣，普恩責內閣，皆當以民族團結爲號召。不過其限度就到此爲止，並有超過這性質，而將總理一席，託付於政黨以外，像這次任命貝當上將爲總理似的。只此一端，可見法國大局如何空前嚴重。</p>
<p>法國政治上的不安定，不自今日始；在歐戰爆發的黨初，已現端倪。尤如達拉第內閣以軍事命令逮捕國會議員，則不但是政治的變故，其性質實已涉及　法問題；及至達拉第向國會要求議會付與更大權力的時候，沒有得到國會　護，逐不得不　　辭職，達拉第辭職後，急追　會黨的政權，移入民主黨共和黨萊諾之手，這是第一次政權的右移。萊諾內閣閣員，由三十五席，減至十八席，內閣權力集中；並且閣員中自左派的社會急進黨至右派的火十字，都有黨員參加；舉國一致內閣，可謂已做到名實相符。不幸政治上力量　見集中，而軍事上的打擊頻至；在此　時方面作戰失利之後，萊諾內閣即又改組，貝當上將其國防部長的職位而去職；改組不過旬日，殘局交之貝當。</p>
<p>記者行文至此，突傳法國業已下令停戰，詳實內容，尚無確報；但綜合各方情況而觀之，法國形式不利至於無法維持，忍痛停戰，原非絕對意外。吾人對此，未獲充分消息，足資評述。今茲所得言者：歐戰至是二急轉直下矣，然當前歧途，不一而足；今茲停戰，但因媾和平諧而戰事復作，亦屬有其可能。即使不然，亦非所謂德國戰勝，法國敗亡，敗者之一切自此盡屬於勝者之謂也。歧途如何　歸，勝者當然有莫大之發言權，絕然非勝者所得片面決定一切也，法國停戰，英國如何，此乃最迫切之問題。德國對法國之媾和條件如如何，對英國又如何，此乃最重要之問題。意大利與德國駢肩作戰，其願望則不盡相侔：義國所要索者，敗者將作如何程度之接受？戰局以外之中立者，如蘇聯，如西班牙，如土耳其，如美國，將爲雙方作如何程度之幹旋？英法兩國之海軍力量，中立各國之一切力量，在決定今後之另一世界中，將有如何程度之運用？凡此數端，皆是關鍵，覺非目前所得逆觀，且視各種逈殊之演變而異其　歸者也。至於遠東，則與歐洲戰局既未相化合爲一，問題之性質其爲單純；不惟中國以不變　萬變之態度，可以克制一切遭遇，且以歐戰至急轉直下，尤容許此單純問題，從容獲得最合理之解決。何也，中國之獨立與完　；乃適應整個國際之願　者也。故闡急轉直下之消息而　包者，必　　處而爲東</p>
<h3>法軍疲憊已極　無法作戰到底</h3>
<p>法國　爾多港　貝當上將、頃奉勒勃倫總統命令、組成新內閣、數日來嚴重局勢、業已展開一新階段、溯自本月十日以來、萊諾總理、會兩度電達美國羅斯福總統、呼願援助、其第二次電文中、並曾說明敵軍作戰部隊共有一百五十師之衆、法國最富庶區域、業被佔領、法國軍隊苦戰多日、已極疲憊、同時又須保護阿爾卑山邊境、左至右繼、勢難持久、迨至昨晨內閣舉行會議時、當將美國復文提付討論、按之此項復文、美國雖尤在物質上陸續予以援助、但情勢緊急、法國實有迫不及待之勢、萊諾總理　要求美國以飛機數千架援助法國、願　此項飛機、曅竟何時可到、亦難確悉、同時據軍當局報告、前綫士兵兩星期以來、與敵軍傾國之師作戰、原已筋疲力盡、而局勢如此、逐令向來堅持作戰到底之萊諾總理亦不得不出於辭職之一途、而由上次歐洲中凡爾等勝利、英國大使康培爾、曾謁見萊諾總理、並面呈該國首相邱吉爾來電（十七日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<h3>馬奇諾防線內　法軍白萬被圍</h3>
<p>柏林　德國軍界昨晚報告、德國軍隊已完成馬奇諾防綫之包圍、法國最精銳軍隊一百萬、昨晚八時（即上海夏季時間今晨五時）尚據守其中、德方消息稱、德軍大砲　已控制有公路、乃法軍由萊茵及塞爾前綫撤退必經之道、德軍最高司令部宣稱頃間德軍已抵達距離瑞士邊境六英哩之某據點、距離義大利國界一百六十英哩、（十七合衆電）</p>
<p>巴黎　希特勒之強有力機械化部隊、每日以五十英里進展之速力、正通過法國、向瑞士國邊境前進、企圖將法國防守馬奇諾力綫之最優良軍隊一百萬人、完全包圍之、當德國機械化部隊向馬奇諾防守綫後部攻擊之際、西綫德軍在飛機中砲掩護下、向馬奇諾防綫之堡壘作猛烈之攻擊、其戰綫記長一百英里、德軍已在數處度過萊茵河、企圖衝破馬奇諾防綫、其目的爲在馬奇諾防綫活動之德軍機械化部隊、抵達瑞士邊界前、阻止馬奇諾防綫北部之法軍南退、（十七日合衆電）</p>
<p>瑞典京城　據倫敦廣播電台昨夜宣稱、德軍已抵法法國東部之第戒附近、巴黎以西之德軍、作戰頗得手、德軍自巴黎向南進展、法軍仍繼續退却、阿爾薩斯與勞蘭之法軍、業已崩潰、（十七日海通）</p>

<h3>饒神父的去思</h3>
<p>— 趙衛謙</p>
<p>在巴黎未陷落的前一二天，饒家駒神父巳經有離滬返國的消息，不幸法軍退却，德軍業巳開入如此繁華的巴黎，旅滬的法僑雖然在無綫電中以「不灰心，不喪志，」彼此互相勉勵，然而一幅難民的流亡圖，巳經擱在我們面前：</p>
<p>路透社空軍特派員謂；渠在人海之中駛行五十餘哩，目擊避難人民，猶如潮湧，此輩難民之忍耐精神，均可欽佩。……各難民兩目雖皆露困倦，但鮮有淚痕。坐於箱籠雜物中間之兒童，時露其笑靨，一若表示對於此長途跋涉，並不感痛苦者。老年人均因困倦而入睡，滿佈皺紋及果決之面容似在睡夢中仍具有決心。難民所駕駛之車輛多隨帶兩物：一為草孽，以備無處容身時權充臥具；二為自行車，俾汽車損壞或馬匹過於勞頓時，暫以之代步。</p>
<p>饒神父仁慈為懷，在一二八和八一三兩役，對於中國的難民，多所全活，眞是「萬家生佛」，有口皆碑；現在法國的難民——饒氏祖國的同胞，——在流亡綫上奔馳，在烽火的尖點上掙扎，饒氏決不能無動於甲。受了法國當局的鼓勵，他毅然決然的，無聲無臭的，黯然神傷的和他第二故鄉的中國，數萬親愛的難民作別；靜悄悄地從黃浦江登輸西渡，取這北美合衆國，再投到那「生於斯，食於斯，長於斯，」的法蘭西的懷抱，暫時捨却東方的難民，專心去撫慰西方的難民，無疑的，這全是戰爭之所賜，到忙煞了一位和平使者，東奔西跑，他巳經是六十七歲鬚髮皓然的老翁！</p>
<p>在這個中日戰爭期內，饒氏是逐日到難民區辦公，一直到他臨行的前一日為止。他的行色匆匆，在倚裝待發的時候，猶處理了許多事務：最重要的是難民善後問題，本來因經費奇窘，南市難民，巳逐漸减少；饒氏去後，老弱的難民，暫由新普育堂照常賤養，而少壯的難民，則目力謀生，再加發口糧半月。難民是世界上最富於同情心的人，因為他們知道在艱難困苦中最需要的是旁人的同情和安慰。饒氏這幾年來的工作，可稱仁至義盡，難胞豈能無動於中？他們預備為饒氏鑄立一座銅像，以資永遠紀念，所以星期六的上午，一人手持一磚，先舉行一個莊嚴的銅像奠基典禮；他們又想把城內的方浜路改為饒家路，方浜橋改需饒家橋，以誌去思。不過他們是心有餘而力不足的，旣無金綫，又無勢力，欲把這些崇德報功的高尙理想，施諸實行，又非俟諸異日不可。難童中有名林雨生者，聰慧異常，饒氏於公餘之瑕，常愛操上海土白，和他閑談，近因離華在邇，特捐助十元，存緒銀行，做他的敎育儲金。饒氏的私人秘書顧綸，在震且大學時，和饒本有師生之誼，近數年來，在慈善事業方面的襄助，尤屬不遺餘力，故饒視之如股肱，特以照相一幀，贈給他的學生，在上面題了幾句說：「你為上帝及祖國出力，塲盡智能，你不愧是我的左手！」在這幾句話裹，看出饒氏是誠懇的，易於感謝他人的，同時也是很幽默的，因為他目己失去一臂，只有右手，故有「不愧是我的左手」云云。</p>
<p>自一九三七年滬戰發動以後，饒氏創立南市難民區，深得中日雙方的重視，厥後又有北美之進，喚起美國人士的同情和注意，全國難民，得益匪尠，因此救濟事業，得以順利進行。重慶國民政府鑒於饒氏之有功人類和文化，最近特以藍寶石綵玉動章贈之，饒氏視為殊榮，時常佩御。饒氏昨日對他的朋友說；「中國就是我的故鄉，我深愛中國，此次雖暫返歐洲，不久還是要回來的。」他最近不用「饒家駒」三字，改名為饒家華」，言為心聲，我們顧名思義，就知道他易名的動機，他的確是一位摯愛中國的國際友人。</p>

<h3>金融　外匯後市起賣風</h3>
<p>外匯昨日市況，匯豐掛牌，悉無上落，英美匯暗市，緊後終告回平，乃後市突有消息　港　狂　，美匯四十餘萬元，至午　走緊之故，因華投機商扒購頗刀，雖美外行等均有供給，但買賣不能平衡，一時美匯　達五　九〇六二五，英金亦告二五八四三七五，午收尙　，後市初亦平定，　買戶絕跡，港　　塞，但有外行吸納，潛勢回硬，結果英金三　　九　　八七五，美匯六元，較上　末收，英金反長〇一五六二五，美匯仍　　〇三一二五，期貨美匯無榮辱，</p>
<p>華商咸有結進</p>
<p>晨　以匯兌，英對美　　　法等各匯俱平，美對英跌一分，對　小五分，對法勿動中央掛牌各匯如舊，銀行晨開現貨買賣，英金三辦士九〇六二五，美匯六元，較之　週六晚收，英平美緊〇三一二五，此因匯兌關係，開後雖港電即來　售，而外行頗　吃胃，供求尚平，六月份　金港電出外行行仍為三辦士九〇六二五，後華商投機家咸起扒購，市　已稍軟化，計吸入美行六月份美匯五元九三七五，匯豐掛牌揭曉不動，白銀平衡稅揭曉未更，此後錢兌業會　每行買進美鈔約合五　九三七五以至九〇六二五，斯時華商投機家繼續結納七月期美匯，外行售予華商投機家為五　七八一二五，緊勢較俏，現貨美匯做達五元九〇六二五，英金喊過三辦士八四三七五，　十一時過後，匯豐有供意，計塞予華商投機家七月期美匯五元七五，致市　漸漸轉定，收　前缺乏變化，結果英金三辦士八七五美匯五元九〇六二五，比晨開現貨英美各軟〇三一二</p>
<p>先利多後利賣</p>
<p>五　〇九三七五、期货亦紧、</p>
<p>港方大量塞出</p>
<p>午後初關尚平、後因港電猛售、情勢轉硬、計賣予外行六月份美滙五元九三三七五、　　予美行七月美滙爲五元八一二五、閉總共出售美滙約四十餘萬元、收盤前突有利空消息、抓戶頓少、結果英金告三辦士九三八七五、美滙六元收英金三辦士八二八一二五、美滙五元八七五、較上週六收、英金期現均長〇一五六二五、美滙現貨微緊〇三一二五、七月份不動、</p>

<h3>先利多後利賣　金市大漲小回　最高價見五千七百二十元</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗幣市況、續於佳境之中、惟無充分利多消息、滙市爲狀尚穩、致高價難已久站、後市謠言繁與、影響疲落、結果僅升六十五元、晨開即昂一百四十元、爲五千六百五十元、嗣經金號及錢兌業賣出跌至五千五百六十元、但不久外滙報緊、某錢兌業獲利略作了結、復回降百元、午後開甚堅、告五千六百九十元、嗣有利空消息、滙市已告回硬、致引起不少賣戶、旋踵售出、　抵全五千五百五十間、因錢兌業賣入若干、拉高四五十元、結果終告五千五百七十五元、較上週末升四千兩元景、海關金等呆定、</p>
<p>烚赤再抬六十五元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初以滙市告緊、人必堅挺、開市橫跳一百四十元、余號進銀號二十兩、爲五千六百五十元、旋某金號見高力塞、加以某銀號及某二綫　乘機狂吸、但頭寸仍感供逾於求、市勢頓轉、未幾即退至五千六百、斯時外滙出　鬆某　　幫立　　爲出、續又回落四十元、銀號互做二十兩、　爲五千五百六十元、此後滙市重又走緊、一時賣者　形減少、反之散戶、斯時賣方愈感擴大、蓋本埠有某種空氣、錢兌業競向收買、金號亦轉賣爲賣、不久竟衡出五千七百元大關、銀號互做二十兩、高爲五千七百二十元、午刻賣風已息、某錢兌業獲利回吐、立回　一百元、錢兌業出銀號二十兩、爲五千六百二十元、將近收盤時、證券幫前來　入、再又提起四十五元、錢兌　進金號三十兩、爲五千六百六十五元、作午收價、午後開時、某錢兌業抬價搜買、進銀號二十兩、爲五千六百九十元、而此價賣方頗有供給、　回小三四十元、嗣乃滙市經港電塞後轉硬、利空空氣濃厚、故樓面上一時賣風甚濃、證券幫銀號兌業等競向吐塞、續又回降百元、銀號對做三十兩、遜爲五千五百五十元、入　某錢兌　復求加碼吸納、而賣者　减、未幾　回五千六百元、後金號及銀號兩幫吐出、回小二十五元、金號出證券幫五十兩、爲五千五百七十五元昨晚收價、結果比一百七十元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價照烚赤　高十數元、收進减低三十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十餘元、均鮮做、</p>
<p>飾金掛價大後回平</p>
<p>銀　首飾金每兩兌出、初時大同行仍　五百七十元、迫九時二刻掛高十元、午後二時三刻回小十元、此後無變化、結果平平、大同函依然　五百七十元、新通行與上價相同、收進减二　　光景、</p>
<h3>外幣一漲卽落</h3>
<p>昨日外幣　況、烚赤始漲繼回、英美金鎊大漲小回、結果比上週六尚各漲一元、英金票始張　跌、比上週六終小四角、　金票一度高至十七元、但旋即步落、午後買氣更盛、晚市退爲十六元六角、香港票晨漲午後回平、日金票始跌繼回、晚　仍一元零九角三分半、</p>
<h3>貼現回升二元</h3>
<p>昨匯劃票據貼現率、略見同上、每千元當日並無變動、貼進爲八十七元、貼出須九十二元、扯價比上週六軋升二元、錢業公會拆息、早午兩市均掛二角五分、計軋升二分云、</p>
<h3>煤炭　煤球回漲六元　—每擔七元六角</h3>
<p>煤球行情、日昨因外滙又緊同業廠盤、每噸又回漲六元、　　一百四十元、送到別加車　、門莊發客、送到每噸一百五十二元、每擔七元六角、每擔七元七角、上下不符、　係　　、</p>
<h3>糧食　怠於爲民食管制之必然後果　米糧操縱肆無忌憚　洋米定貨到貨源源不絕　米價一漲再漲高高無比</h3>
<p>昨日上午米市內、晨間方開、　見哄動、內地鄉莊客戶、競相拉進、市面沸騰、各色洋米立漲一先、是後更兼本街店胃跟踪逐鹿、浮戶之搶帽子、形勢乃再接再厲、迄中市、一號陳西貢已叩六十元大關、開出五十九元半、二號五十八元二角、一號　選五十九元、二號五十七元半、火絞五十九元、五十八元半、小絞五十七元、東京　尖五十六元八角、混合碎五十二元二角、米　五十五元、其後漲風稍殺、浮戶頻將獲利貨紛紛出範、市貨頓旺、立呈供　於求、當見各價步步下游、收盤較中市已回落元砠、內地各幫城郊三千多包、日新交易　有二號西貢三千二百噸、又混合碎米一千五百噸成交、計達孚出二號二千二百噸、碎米一千噸、二號價均開六十二元、碎米則達孚五十四元半、慎計加一角、均下月初裝船、按前後來定米總計已有近三十五萬包、大部份在下月中旬到申、因此午收已經回跌、下午續跌、小絞晚收銀行棧五十六元二角、降茂棧五十五元八角、已與週六晚市相似、其他則稍有　次、回籠二號　米六十三元、又西貢二號五十二元二角半、開出三百多噸、晚市受主抑抵近元末妥、然以洋米尚可續定、人心均已　半、</p>
<p>粳糯國米、內地來源仍稀、共祇一千四五百包、是以當此洋米奔勝之際、無論塲內外明暗市尤覺緊俏、市上開出金凓特元五十四元、常丹白元五十三元左右、江北貨九十一元出另、計升二元、厚薄粳傳開暗盤開出常幫特清六十八元、蘇昆常州白粳六十七元左右、青泗特傳六十八元、普通六十六七元、南港早稻高自六十五元半、次至六十三元半、較週前提　二三元、</p>
<p>連日米價暴漲、　屬毫無理　、完全是投機商人作崇搗把、又爲租界對於全市民食、無整個計　、亦怠於作爲惟對於西人食用、較為注意、如物品標價、亦偏重西人所食用者爲多、即對於西人職員階級之生活指數、業已在編制中、且將所試編者　表、而華人除工人生活費用指數外、對於大多數之職員、爲水階級生活情況、木有措施、此尚具小焉　也、若洋米只管有大量定貨、復有不少存米、而價已達六十元、粳米亦近七十元、總由於不能悉心爲大業衆福利着想、任令　縱民食又不能統籌全局、枝枝節節　爲之、徒損威信無形、反使奸商照大妄爲也、</p>
<p>洋米　量不斷到滬、昨日怡和洋行裕生輪、自香　運來　萬八千零七十五包、停　羅斯福碼頭、正在起卸中、</p>
<h3>麵粉廠盤屹立　據蕪湖麥續到五六車—</h3>
<p>麵粉　昨日廠盤仍爲十三元八角、惟各廠祇限供給本街零批、　非實銷者、概被拒絕、客盤亦鮮變化、而廠方對於整批客銷、亦然限制、　範貨老車牌　碼　枯、售脫者寥寥、故市面殊惑平靜、正式市面恐將待新麥湧登時期矣、又麵粉今日有三萬二千包、並二百包、俱運廈門、</p>
<p>小麥　昨日新小麥交易、並無正式市面、惟傳京滬路到貨約有五六車、一說蔗湖麥二批佳、售價恐須提高、一說該麥早將路貨、拋售與日廠、並不在市出售、又麥子今日有一百包、運往廈門、</p>
<p>無錫</p>
<p>新小麥近日到源見湧、前市廣豊大　茂二等廠、動辦三四千包、高杜麥每包開三十二元五角、客麥三十一元、　天又到新麥五六千包、市情暫平、因滬運阻滯、本邑各廠需麥甚殷、市價不致過低、（知）</p>
<h3>雜糧　蠶豆到銷相埓　黃豆再漲四五角</h3>
<p>蠶豆　新蠶豆雖傳統制、但未實行、故販運商在搶運、致來源見接、故昨市交易雖見開展、然市況轉局穩定、計汕頭（心思）泉州與化本街尊辦去嘉定白靈豆千禮包、北港青蠶豆三百餘包、瀏河青蠶豆五十包、浦東青蠶豆十餘包、</p>
<p>黃豆　市尚屬緊俏、榨油廠辦　活潑、行情再漲四五角　統市做開青島豆二百包、　埠豆十四車、南京豆三車、蕪湖豆三百五十餘包、安慶豆四百包、及崇明豆共四百包、浦東豆三百包、</p>
<p>又豆子前日（十六）有一千零十九報、運往廈門、又有九百七十五包、運往新加坡、又三百包運往西　、今日又有二千一百八十包豆子、及　皮一千六百包運往廈門、另有苞米五百包、運往威海衝、生仁二百七十二包、運往香港、</p>
<h3>油餅　荳油挫二三元　豆餅市勢盤旋</h3>
<p>荳油　昨日荳油市勢、在晨除已呈鬆象、但被一部份強行把持、然去路不繼、忍心渙　、大局動搖、至午後突告驟跌。結果比較上週六挫跌二三元、交易祈成妥大連油一百五十桶、及大有廠油二百但而已、生油　前日（十六）有九百九十八聽、運往廈門、又有六百四十六聽、運往香港、</p>
<p>豆餅　汕頭幫不動、有則亦心思交易、故　勢受天時無大雨之影響、致市有　盤旋之　、故昨　好五分、祇中內地與什　去大有四牌三千張、又牲記餅八千五百張、查豆餅前日（十六）有一千八百三十張、運往香港、今日有一萬九千七百八十五張、運往廈門、</p>
<h3>證券　內債交易不多　洋股稍形與奮</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨日市況、由人心之虛軟、漸漸下降、　有二十號及久豊等之賣進、得以維持、然仍小去三四角。迨至午後、仍未能立定、前途尚有波濤也、昨日上午聯益。長康。胡鶴記。恒孚等均有賣出、午後二十號及久豊買進較多、鴻康同康亦有抵補、午收卽小二三角、午後二十號及久豊稱續買進、昌記及鼎康頗有賣出、鴻康同康轉買爲賣、故賣氣仍比較爲盛、結果各佔除丁種未能開出外、餘均小去二角半至四角不等、成交總數約計八十萬元之譜、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>類別　最高　最低　收盤　比前日</p>
<p>統計甲六〇·六　　六〇·四〇六〇·五〇跌〇·三五</p>

<p>股票交易、成交啟新洋服公司股二百股、　爲十元正</p>
<p>又衆業公所報告、股市開盤、　勢不定、移時逐形向上終　買氣旺盛、價格腌奔、多時未見之激昇氣象、復現於昨日、雖　聞獲利了結之風、亦至猛烈、市况收盤、堅挺非凡、英聯與怡和、　受歡迎、收盤二十五元二五及三十四元二五有買　、最高時各見二十六元與三十五元之價、</p>

<h3>紗花　七月期雙馬紗　昨已開出　多頭心思爲之一振</h3>
<p>紗市轉　平靜、且見上漲此因海外棉市回昂、加之美匯告縮　致人心安定、空方活動振補、同時香港方面、對於粗紗需要繼續不懈、所以市商賴以支持矣、七月期雙馬紗價已有開出、爲一千二百三十元、於是多頭較爲安心、又可下月套出、然　者未見踴　、因之成交不　、</p>
<p>現紗晨開、聞外匯　縮、同時印美棉花、一致上升、致呆滯之人心、較爲振作、二十支雙馬價爲一千一百五十元、直　至一千一百九十元、旋以獲利者出檔、又復回挫至一千一百六十元、迨至收盤時、終以黃金價昂、人氣挺秀、再行回上十餘元、查半日間成交統計一千六百十五元、行情二十支雙馬漲四十三元、今日有棉紗三十五件運　　、六百九十件　香港、茲將各幫口買去之額量、分列如左、同行一，二七五　廈門　五</p>
<p>香港　三五五　寧波　二〇　統計一，六一五</p>
<p>印棉成交四百件</p>
<p>本棉交易杜絕、惟印棉成交較爲熱鬧、日廠有一筆　辦、其餘同行買賣稍形活動、此因海外印　棉市一致上升、所以行情　好、一步、不過生意未見十分起色、茲將現棉成交情形列左、</p>
<p>亞姆拉一九八·〇〇　東華進　100件</p>
<p>杜力拉二一七·〇〇　通幫進　100件</p>
<p>司登一五·〇〇　慶盛進　100件</p>
<p>白洛去二〇三·〇〇　同行　100件</p>
<p>另訊外棉市價、紐約棉市、日來殊見挺秀、　日晨初　　、即因投機者之　買　補之活　、結果收盤價格較之上日漲電十餘　音、印度棉　亦因人心轉好及歐洲出口商　買進、結果連同預測漲八羅比之巨、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、近日因海外棉市之步漲、滙兌亦漸轉緊、故人心亦殊良好、現貨交易不多、但尚有零星之點綴、一般　見、俱認市况步入佳境、目前之棉價、將有漲而無跌也、</p>
<h3>疋頭　內地布銷漸盛</h3>
<p>布市穩定、以原料紗花堅挺、而蘇·浙·皖內地茶蘭等土產先後登塲、棉布　需漸增、故布價跌風已轉緩和、昨布大盤一致平定、散額按布仍廉一角至一角半、本街批發號進粗布·府綢·洋紗·漂布二百餘件、浙東溫甬幫辦　洋紗·粵幫辦色布·色斜五六十箱、國外星加坡等地辦漂布·色布·漂斜近二千疋、</p>
<p>東布市勢轉堅、白貨龍頃細布、晨市售開每疋三十五元五角、嗣以金價回挫、至午爲三十五元〇五分、下午因各方空氣利於多頭、同業中有一部份人認爲跌風漸平、略其　納、龍頭細布收盤又升至三十五元二角半、四君子　　每碼九角一分二厘半、</p>
<p>疋頭十六日出口、運香港二百十九件、運新加坡一百五十二件、運士樂二十件、運　　四十件、十八日運廈門四十五件、運威海衛三百件、運烟台九十五件、運天津三百零　件、</p>
<h3>糖布　洋糖平定</h3>

<h3>絲茶　內地絲經　不能來滬</h3>
<p>上海絲廠、自去年因原料受人控制、在今春頗多移資內地開設小絲廠、然惜大多小絲廠均在淪陷區、故仍　「統制」所扼住、近悉僞方籍「建設」捐之名、對生絲運滬、將實行勒收百分之十二捐稅、然以每橋廠絲價　千元計、則每但須納三百元、故內地絲經已不能來滬</p>
<p>本埠絲市、因停而止拋貨交易、中國絲商於時至今日、已深知國家與商業關係之重要矣、</p>
<p>昨橫　現貨一五五〇元、近期一五六〇元、遠期一五八六元、紐約星期停、本埠絲交流沉寂</p>
<h3>錄茶逐步下跌</h3>
<p>昨日洋莊錄茶市況、各莊行家、均以歐洲戰事益臻嚴重、進益形俏俐、全市祇協和同手等行、貨進新陳珍眉錄茶、攻擊一百八十餘箱、新貨售價自二百六十五元至二百八十元、陳貨售價一百三十五元、較前挫跌二三十元、至抽芯珍眉、去絡仍趨呆滯云、</p>
<p>又茶葉前日（十六日）有五百二十六件、運往新加坡、又有十五件、運往西真、昨日由香港來茶葉五百件、溫州來五百七十四件、今日有一百四十五件、運往廈門、又五百件、運往天津、</p>
<h3>五金　竹節鋼條下降</h3>
<p>竹節鋼條交易、自外埠客商進胃銳　後、兼之本街建築　所辦亦不多、致市勢十分呆滯行情一落再落、故市場人心亦震　不定、查前昨市　已由一千四百三十元、跌至一千四百元關內、而五分至一寸之花色、亦山一千三百八十元跌入一千三百五十元關中、</p>

<h3>從曠達說起</h3>
<p>— 嚴以松</p>
<p>偶翻唐詩三百首，讀利李白做的三首行路難，在其末首末兩句「目樂生前一杯酒，何須身後千載名」下面，評註者這樣註着；「你看末二句寫來何等曠達。」</p>
<p>中國人的普遍心理，不是喜歡曠達，便是喜歡呻吟，呻吟並不是一定有病，往往無病也照樣叫哀喊苦地呻吟着。文人們是其中的俊佼者。所以一篇文章，一首詩，或是一闋詞，多半不是「莫使金樽空對月」，便是横一句「悲哉」，豎一句「嗚呼」。因爲不這樣，好像這作品便覺得淡然無味。雖然例外的也有，但不過是極少數的例外。</p>
<p>這種風氣一直到現在還是遺留着。中間有人雖也曾起來反抗過，但未見得生效。所以有一時期「沉淪」式的小說特別有銷路，有一時期風月酒色的作品也很受人歡迎。可是倒霉的不是寫這些文章的作者，而是受這些文章極深度影響的讀者，尤其是一般靑年們！</p>
<p>我們很知道個個人有時都會悲哀痛苦，但以爲徒然叫哀喊苦完全沒用；我們也很知道個個人都應寢曠達，但以爲一種消極式的曠達是要不得。消極式的曠達，便是悲哀痛苦的另一面表示，不過其方式不是「噯呀」「噯呀」的呻吟，而是利用酒色風月要求暫時的麻醉，忘却一切的痛苦，如果眞的是有痛苦的話。</p>
<p>這種消極式的曠達使。所受到的損失，是比徒然呻吟喊苦更來得大，也更來得慘。</p>
<p>可憐在中國，這種曠達法偏偏又極流行，以上海一隅而論，酒樓菜館，到處是人山人海，而跳舞塲遊戲塲也儘塡得滿坑滿谷。</p>
<p>然而一般無聊的文人們似乎還不在乎，還在儘量散佈其毒素，而唯恐不及。</p>
<p>朋友，你們不要再上當了。我忠吿你們，他們無病呻吟在訴痛苦，你們小要跟他們去痛苦，他們引誘你們到酒色傷中去曠達一下，你們史千萬不要去！如果眞的你們自己遇到什麼可悲傷痛苦的事，不要徒徒叫喊或求麻醉，須想辦法克服。一個人並不一定都要身後千載名，但只求活着有些意義便好了。行路雖難也得行，確不會行小到的。</p>
<p>這也可以說是曠達，不過是另一方式，積極的，而不是消極的。</p>
<h3>生的倔強</h3>
<p>— 雷星</p>
<p>讀完了一本流浪者作的傳記，我得到許多感想和敎訓。我的幻想馳奔於美洲火車的車頂上，林叢中；還彷彿看見一個裝了假腿的漢子，在歐洲的村鎭往來行乞，售賣花邊。</p>
<p>你能想像嗎？一個流浪者經年累月的把生命消磨在美歐二洲，並且跌折了一條腿；但末了他成爲詩人——爲蕭伯納和其他大批評家所讚賞的詩人。是誰賜給他勇氣和毅力？是什麽鞭策一個殘廢的人立志於分行的抒寫呢？牧師口中的上帝，騎士嘴裏的戀人嗎？都不是。我說是一股生的倔强。</p>
<p>倔强曾經爲人所厚非，因爲我們這社會需要能圓能方的「大丈夫」。然而人類的得以不滅，民族得以不亡，正由於我們祖先的倔强。</p>
<p>在洪荒的古代，人類和殘酷的自然搏鬥；如今已經不同一我是說對象不同，搏鬥永遠不變。在大苦難和災痛中我們爭取生存和有陽光的日子，我們喊出了響澈雲天的呼號：我們要活。</p>
<p>貫澈於一個多采的生命中的，是生的倔强的意志。記住這並非貪生，在威武，貨財之下苟活，是懦夫，怯漢的卑鄙行徑。正相反，生的倔强是戰鬥和搏擊，並且是永遠不息的。</p>
<p>活着總歸是可愛的，但活的意義不單是養活生命的意思；烟火食我們都得吃，因爲我們不是神仙而是人，可是更要緊的是我們要「做人——」因爲我們遭逢了做不得人的威脅。支持着反抗牛馬境遇的力量，正是生的倔强。</p>
<p>風土</p>
<h3>紅十字會之城</h3>
<p>— 凌霜</p>
<p>離馬奇諾防錢不過幾英里遠的地方，在一個滿佈着防禦工事的軍事區城中，有一個名叫法士堡（Phalsbourg）的法國城鎭，是世界上最沒有軍事色彩的城鎭。鎭裹沒有機關槍，來福槍，或手槍；沒有用來保護小橋樑的高射砲；也沒有防空地窖的標記或沙袋。在夜間，城中的燈光反映在天空中，比平時還要明亮。戰爭的工具一天到晚滾動着—坦克車啦，彈藥箱啦，兵士啦，馬匹啦，貨車啦。可是城中的不帶武裝的哨兵命令它們轉到別地方去了。活躍的戰士如果想進入這個城鎮來，只有躺在界床上被人抬着的一法。</p>
<p>因爲法士堡是紅十字會的首都；法國史其格將軍（Geneal　Schikele）爲了要使傷兵避免被轟擊的恐怖，曾提議設立紅十字會區域，這個城鎭就是第一大的人道主義的實騐。在一九三二年的國際紅十字會大會中，史其格將軍提議說，在未來的戰爭中，無軍事價値的小城鎭應該交給紅十字會去用，由各戰鬥國擔保絕對的安全。德，法，英及其幾個國家都表示贊成；一九三九所要通過的協定雖則沒有簽字，可是法國照已定的計劃把紅十字會之城建立起來了。</p>
<p>城中醫院的屋頂都畫着明顯的標記；城中的方塲也畫了一個很大的紅十字。對於這個城鎭的性質及位置，當局早已作大規模的宜傳。道個實騐能够成功到甚麽程度，會視德國對這協定抱甚麽態度。到目前爲止，一切倒還十分順利呢。</p>
<h3>健康訓</h3>
<p>— 競爭</p>
<p>我們須少化些吃喝的時間，而多多默想。</p>
<p>出外與其乘騎代步，不如安步以當車。</p>
<p>對於穿着方面且少老究，要緊的還是洗淸自己的身體。</p>
<p>不要無謂地憂愁，要多多地工作。</p>
<p>怠惰地消耗地消耗光陰，那就不如遊戲來得好。</p>
<p>話寡說，應多注意思考。</p>
<p>少浪費，多生產。</p>
<p>不要無緣無故地發怒駡人，應常常帶着嘻笑。</p>
<p>莫空談，多做些實際的事。</p>
<p>霍桑探案</p>
<h3>舞后的歸宿</h3>
<p>— 程小青著</p>
<p>第一章「一位挺漂亮的小姐！」</p>
<p>霍桑所說的那隻鐵箱，就在道長椅的左手裏。這箱形是長方的，外面的噴漆是淺藍色，就式樣和色澤方面說，很像是一架解地收音機。靠窗的一角，有一個書架。其實稱它書架，未免犯着「砌詞誣陷」的語病。因爲架上並沒有書，除了幾本像書桌面上一類的圖畫刊物和報紙以外，大半是虛空的。靠後面壁上，另有一張立體式的鏡台，台上的杯碟酒瓶導頗，也一律是外國貨。鏡台東邊的壁上，掛一幅鑲闊金框的油畫，的有三尺長，二尺高，畫的也是外國風景。總之，瀉窒中一切器物所給予我的印象，祇有忘了時代忘了國家的極端的「奢靡」和「浪費」！</p>
<p>霍桑拿了鑰匙走到鐵箱面前，小心地將鐵箱門上圓形的錀匙孔蓋栘開，將鑰匙揷入，完全吻合。他索性將鑰匙一旋，把箱門柄同樣開動，隨手拉了開來。裏面也有三四疊紥縛的法幣。他還沒有動手檢查這鐵箱的內容，忽聽得一陣子咳嗽聲音。他連忙將鐵箱的門關上，旋轉身來，迎接這位把咳嗽聲音做前驅的來人。</p>
<p>這時倪金壽已領了死者的姑丈李芝範走進來了。</p>
<p>（十八）</p>

<p>㳺藝界</p>
<h3>克拉克蓋勃爾</h3>
<p>— 影</p>
<p>從小就很聰明，他演戲的經騐，還是由學校中得來，因為他在學校時代，校中有游藝會舉行，如果要表演戲劇，那麼他總會擔任重要的角色的。此後脫離了學校，在社會方面，又經過不少的磨練，會加入劇團，上演舞台戲劇。所以上了銀幕，駕輕就熟，隔不多時，就有驚人演技表現出來，成了一顆紅星。</p>
<p>藝院褒獎</p>
<p>的確，克拉克蓋勃爾目前在好萊塢巳成了一代的藝人，在男星之中，他的演技可以說是有數的人才呢！他所主演的影片每一部都有相當成績。一般的電影觀衆，對他也十九發生了相當的好感。他曾獲得一九三四年度電影藝術學院褒獎，那一年三個得獎的男星之中，他竟列在第一名。從此直到現在，他在電影界的地位正一天天的高起來。</p>
<p>一舉成名</p>
<p>他在好萊塢的電影界中，能夠獲得今日的地位而一般人都認他為特出的人才，的確不是件容易的事情。因為不多幾年之前他到了好萊塢，連得想做一個臨時演員，一時也沒有機會。但他並不灰心，還是繼續的努力決心去銜破這一條電影的陣綫。結果有志者事竟成，是被他銜過了，而且出人意外的他上了銀幕，就一躍成名，紅得這樣快，是為一般男星所不及的</p>
<p>有情眷屬</p>
<p>他在銀幕上旣有這樣的成功，照例好萊塢就有不少女明星追求他，結果卡羅郎白是獲得了勝利，前年冬天他們倆巳打得火熱，羅曼斯時常有得傳出。有情人成眷屬，一九三九年的春天影城中把克拉克蓋勃爾和卡羅朗白結婚的消息散佈到世界上每一個角落裹，使影迷們感到這一對銀慕情侶是適於理想的。從此他們倆就組織成一個美滿的家庭，時常有不少賓客上他們的家去，而去年耶誕時節，卡羅朗白更會親作羹湯來待客呢。</p>
<p>竿頭日上</p>
<p>這一决在「亂世佳人」一片裹就由克拉克蓋勃爾擔任男主角，由於他過去的經騐，天賦的藝才，演這樣一個角色，自然很配合。加着女主角由新人費雯莉飾演，自必相得益彰。因此，當「亂世佳人」攝製完成而後，在美公映的時節，克拉克蓋勃爾又獲得影迷的好評。事實吿訴我們蓋勃爾是一個很會演戲的男角。</p>
<h3>舒涅離滬</h3>
<p>前日的下午，一位文化工作者，悄悄地離滬赴內地去了。他就是以前在晨報寫影評的冒舒湮，也就是在中旅一度客串過「葛嫩娘」等戲的施汶</p>
<p>當戰事發生後，他會奉派北上慰勞國軍，到過武漢，河南，山西，陝北等地，後來曾任第四戰區總司令部的秘書兼辦政訓的工作。</p>
<p>此次他悄然離滬，同樣是為了做一點戰地文化工作，盡一份文化人應有的使命。在他離滬前，他完成了二本戲劇，就是把「董小宛」「精忠戰國」編成了二本話劇劇本，現在這兒本劇本，交給「中旅」唐槐秋預備在不久的將來上演於璇宮。</p>
<h3>金都大戲院月底動工</h3>
<p>— 小許</p>
<p>—定陽曆元旦揭幕</p>
<p>影業巨子柳氏兄弟，張善現，張石川等合資創辦之「金都大戲院」（英文名稱為Gorden　Castle　Theatre）已決定於本月底置手建造。此未來之新型電影院位於福煦路圖孚路口，地段交通，優越便利。現該處空地四週已圍以竹籬，動工之氣象已呈。據測半年內可完工，而於陽歷元旦開幕。今院圖樣出請凱泰建築公司楊錫鏐黃元吉之手。樣式流綫型。設備方面，冷熱氣機皆為最新式者，聲光座，完全採用第一流出品。座位共一千五百餘。分樓上五百，樓下一千。正鬥闢於馬路轉角之正中。二側為店面，將來開映之片，多為國華新華之第一輪出品云。</p>
<h3>記實驗音樂會</h3>
<p>— 張永康</p>
<p>在十四日晚上，靑年會舉行一次「實騐音樂會」。節目有一合奏，獨奏，合唱和獨唱。一</p>
<p>合奏多半是由「梅也五重奏」演奏的，以「天堂和地獄序曲最好，「搖籃曲」也十分優美。</p>
<p>獨奏的樂器是小提琴，演奏者是梅也，中國籍的俄國人，陳歌辛鋼琴伴奏，曲為「茨崗曲」。這是一首十分難的樂曲，除了在慢調的某些樂段不够淸晣外，演奏得很好。最後的急速處，是奏的頗為明快而有力的。</p>
<p>合唱由陳歌辛指揮，共六首。「前進」原是伏爾加船夫曲調子，如今詞句改動了，却不失原曲的沉痛之感。「行船樂」的輕快，恰興「前進」成一對比。「黃金色的浮雲」，「祖國進行曲」和「復貝加爾之歌」是舊俄或新俄的作品，指揮者在處理這些俄國曲調時有特到的地方，好像俄國人一樣：那是說，他懂得那種俄國音樂中所特具的豐富的表情法。「鍊鐵」唱得很好，只是誰也聽不出那些詞句來。</p>
<p>須平和胡泉祥的音質都是很好的，只是有些「上台慌」，似乎不敢唱的樣子。鄭守燕不會唱，聽衆頗有此些失望。</p>
<p>據說「實音」大半是職業靑年，沒有專學音樂的人，果眞如此，確是該算十分成功的了。</p>
<h3>又一雙包案　—國華聯美同時攝梁紅玉</h3>
<p>因「梁山伯祝英台」而造成民間電影白熱競爭之聯美公司，第二部作品籌劃甯日，早巳購得「梁紅玉」與「華麗緣」兩個劇本，將揀其一攝製，但電影公會席上，國華主人柳中浩裏示「梁紅玉」行將開拍，而「華麗綠」亦早巳內定，都不能讓步，聯美代表願意聽免衝突，請與國華各得其一，并於聯獎所攝之作品中，亦請國華加人股款，柳氏未尤，遂亦不歡而散，勢將繼「三笑」之後，再鬧雙包案矣。</p>

<h3>Rapid Turnaround in the European War Situation: French Government Orders Armistice with Germany; General Pétain Painfully Announces Surrender to Germany; Hitler to Confer with Mussolini on Aftermath</h3>
<p>New York: According to the National Broadcasting Company wireless telegraph and Agence France-Presse, General Pétain, the Premier of the French Cabinet, declared today that France has surrendered to German leader Hitler. Last night, French troops were ordered to cease resistance. The French government has already begun peace negotiations with Germany. (United Press dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>London: British officials announced that they would not criticize General Pétain's radio broadcast announcing France's abandonment of the war against Germany. One hour before General Pétain's declaration, the British Expeditionary Force and French troops were still fighting against the German army on the Normandy front. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>Bordeaux Port: The new cabinet held a meeting at 10:00 this morning and issued a public statement saying, "The government has made a decision due to the pressure of the situation." Premier General Pétain then broadcast to the nation, stating, "I wrote to the enemy yesterday, asking if he would meet with me, like two soldiers, in a dignified manner after the battle, to seek a path to peace." (Havas dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>New York: According to news from the National Broadcasting Company, the new French Premier, General Pétain, has announced the surrender to Germany. The National Broadcasting Company received the following telegram from General Pétain: "Last night, I contacted the German headquarters. I now announce with deep sorrow that we have ceased hostilities." Here, General Pétain stated in his radio address that France will continue to fight in Africa and the East. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>London: French Premier General Pétain has just broadcast, saying, "We must abandon the war. We have asked the enemy for an honorable peace." (Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>London: France has surrendered to the German army today, and has ordered its troops to cease resistance to the German blitzkrieg tactics, which have penetrated the heart of France and surrounded one million good French soldiers in the Maginot Line. (United Press dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>Hitler's Headquarters: The Premier of the new French government, General Pétain, delivered a radio address to the French people this afternoon, stating that France has been forced to cease hostilities and has taken steps to notify the government of this decision and to inquire about Germany's preconditions for accepting France's request. Official sources here announced this afternoon that German leader Hitler will meet with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini to discuss the attitudes to be adopted by Germany and Italy. (Haitong dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>Berlin: Official documents here declared that General Pétain announced France's surrender. Hitler will meet with Mussolini to inform him of the results. (Haitong Agency urgent dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>Berlin: Since the French Reynaud "War Cabinet" resigned, critical comments have been issued from German circles here, stating that "the French army is now in full control." They recalled that in 1918, Germany's surrender to the Allied powers was initiated by the German army. However, observers here are not willing to speculate whether the French government, headed by General Pétain, will beg for peace from Germany. This kind of request from Bordeaux must first be presented to leader Hitler, who is currently at the front. Germany has always demanded unconditional surrender from the countries it has declared war on. Observers here analyzed that Britain is "Germany's real enemy," so the peace terms Germany offers to France will be more lenient than those offered to Britain. (United Press dispatch, 17th)</p>
<h3>Pétain Sincerely Tells the Nation: The War Must End</h3>
<p>Bordeaux: Premier Pétain broadcast to the French nation, "French compatriots, at the request of the President, I have assumed the responsibility of directing the French government from today onwards. My esteemed army, bravely fighting, those who are wounded and have lost limbs, will be cherished. I dare to assert that the army, during this glorious and upright war of resistance, has fulfilled our responsibilities to the Allied powers. I dare to assert that I, as the commander of those proud veterans, will assist them, and I dare to assert that the whole nation will trust them. I am now dedicated to France, in order to alleviate its suffering. The French people are gathered around the government. I am now the chairman of the government during this difficult trial. They should suppress their sorrow and only believe in the destiny of their country, and obey nothing else. I now tell you with a broken heart that the war must end. Last night, I personally wrote to the enemy, asking if he would meet with me in the manner of soldiers after a glorious battle, or seek a way to end hostilities. I think of those soldiers who faithfully uphold their old military traditions and confront enemies far exceeding them in number. I also think of the old comrades I commanded in the last great war. I have dedicated myself to France at this critical moment to improve its situation. At this moment, I think of the unfortunate men and women, the refugees, forced by the calamities of war, abandoning their homes, and wandering on the roads. I wish to express to them my most sincere sympathy and love." (Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>
<h3>Franco to Serve as Mediator in Peace Talks</h3>
<p>New York: News received here this morning from Europe indicates that after Hitler completes his encirclement of the Maginot Line, General Franco of Spain may serve as a mediator in the Franco-German peace talks. After General Pétain's new cabinet was established last night, the new foreign minister visited the Spanish ambassador. It is reported that Foreign Minister Baudouin presented secret documents to the Spanish ambassador, and then visited the British ambassador, presenting the same documents. It is generally speculated that the secret documents of the French Foreign Minister are to request the Spanish General Franco to mediate the Franco-German war. Observers believe that this document is related to France's request for peace from Hitler, and that General Pétain and General Franco served together in North Africa, and their friendship is quite deep. Observers firmly believe that if the French government decides to negotiate peace with Germany, General Pétain can request General Franco to be the mediator. (United Press dispatch, 17th)</p>
<h3>Britain Understands France, Will Fight Alone</h3>
<p>London: Although no official statements have been issued yet, it is generally believed that Britain will continue to fight alone. The declaration of determination to fight to the end, issued by responsible parties last night, will remain in effect. The wording of the declaration stated, "Britain's firm determination to continue the struggle cannot be expressed in clearer and more practical terms."</p>
<p>People here are responding to the news of the French surrender with strong determination. There is no condemnation of France. It is acknowledged that France made this decision under oppressive circumstances. People are inevitably speculating about the future situation. Many observers believe that Germany's second step will be a peace offensive, or perhaps through some neutral intermediaries. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>London: It is not yet known what kind of peace terms France can hope for from Germany. People here hope that the French navy will continue the war, because France is the world's second-largest naval power. It is also generally said that if the navies of Germany, France, and Italy unite, Britain will suffer an extremely serious threat at sea, making it easier for Germany to launch a rapid attack on Britain. Britain is now at war with two countries, Germany and Italy, and is facing a terrible war effort, with no support other than material aid from the United States. It is heard that France's surrender is partly due to the content of President Roosevelt's reply to the former French Premier Reynaud, because the French military situation has fallen into a very disappointing state, and only large-scale direct military intervention by the United States could enable the French government to continue to resist the German army. (United Press dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>London: According to reports from British press circles, although France has surrendered, the British mainland and the entire British Empire will continue the war against Germany and Italy. It is heard that the British government will issue a detailed statement on France's decision to cease hostilities to clarify Britain's position. This statement may be announced tonight. (United Press dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>Bordeaux Port: According to official news, British troops are now arriving at the front lines in a steady stream, carrying fully equipped tank fleets. (Havas dispatch, 16th)</p>
<h3>The News of the Armistice Spreads Like a Bolt from the Blue</h3>
<p>London: General Pétain, the 84-year-old French hero who gained fame in the last European war for defending Verdun, assumed the post of Premier at one of France's darkest moments since 1870. Less than 24 hours later, he suddenly issued a radio address, saying that France had surrendered to Germany. Although there was speculation outside today that the new French government would make a major decision, no one initially expected France to take this step, so the public heard General Pétain's declaration as a bolt from the blue. Radio receivers here received General Pétain's broadcast saying, "We must cease fighting. We have asked the enemy for an honorable peace." Official confirmation from other sources has not yet been obtained here tonight. Urgent news has come from New York, saying that the National Broadcasting Company received General Pétain's broadcast declaring France's surrender to Germany, saying, "I have communicated with the German commander-in-chief at night. I announce with deep sorrow that we have ceased hostile actions." One hour before General Pétain's broadcast, it was learned here that the German army had advanced to the Swiss border. After the French army destroyed important fortifications of the Maginot Line, it withdrew from the line. It was also heard that the German army in the Paris area had advanced sixty miles southwest of Paris. It is not known where the British troops who rushed to France in recent days are now, but one hour before General Pétain's broadcast, it was still heard that the British army was fighting alongside the French army in Normandy. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>New York: After the initial news of the French surrender came, the American public was greatly shocked. Although the public's understanding of the serious situation in France has been increasing day by day, very few people expected it to take this step. Many Americans regret that they failed to provide more assistance to the Allied powers in the early stages of the war. One of the main speculative events at present is the future of the French fleet. If Britain continues to fight alone, what will happen to this powerful fleet? This is of great importance. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The European War Has Taken a Sharp Turn!</h3>
<p>The French Reynaud cabinet resigned en masse, and exceptionally, the military figure General Pétain succeeded as Premier. The other cabinet members include Vice Premier Weygand, Minister of the Army Colson, Minister of the Navy Darlan, Minister of the Air Force Puech, and Minister of National Defense Coursault, all of whom are outstanding figures in the military. At a time when a strong enemy is oppressing the country and the nation is in danger, the immediate priorities of France are naturally how to deal with all external and internal problems. Under such circumstances, it is natural for the military to take power. However, one thing to note is that the French President should appoint members of the two houses of parliament as Premier. The ministers of the Navy and Air Force, although they can belong to the military, and the Foreign Minister, although he can be an administrative official or envoy, do not necessarily have to be members of parliament. However, the post of Prime Minister must belong to the leader of the majority party in parliament. Now, General Pétain is the Premier, which is truly an evolution in politics and a special exception since the establishment of the French Third Republic. French politics has always been complex, with numerous parties and intricate political views. Because a larger party is not enough to control parliament, the formation of a cabinet often involves a coalition of several parties. Therefore, the policies of any cabinet cannot be solely implemented by one party, but always compromise the political misfortunes of several parties. As a result, the cabinet's actions cannot be sufficiently firm and consistent, and the cabinet's life cannot be sustained. These two phenomena have a smaller impact in peacetime, but are inevitably felt to be unsound in wartime. At a time when the entire country needs to unite to face the outside world, it is natural for all parties to strengthen unity and stand under the same banner to cope with difficulties. The Clemenceau cabinet and the Poincaré cabinet in the past both took national unity as their slogan. However, their limits ended here, and there was no surpassing this nature to entrust the post of Premier to someone outside the political parties, like the appointment of General Pétain as Premier this time. From this alone, it can be seen how unprecedentedly serious the overall situation in France is.</p>
<p>The political instability of France did not start today; it had already shown signs at the beginning of the outbreak of the European War. For example, when the Daladier cabinet arrested members of parliament by military order, it was not only a political change, but its nature had already involved legal issues. When Daladier asked parliament to grant him greater power, he did not get parliamentary support and had to resign. After Daladier's resignation, the political power of the anti-communist parties was quickly transferred to the hands of the Democratic Republican Reynaud, which was the first shift to the right in power. The members of the Reynaud cabinet were reduced from thirty-five to eighteen, and the power of the cabinet was concentrated. Moreover, members from the left-wing Radical Socialist Party to the right-wing Croix-de-Feu participated in the cabinet. A national unity cabinet can be said to have achieved conformity between name and reality. Unfortunately, the concentration of political power was seen, but military blows came frequently. After the loss of the war at this time, the Reynaud cabinet was reorganized again, and General Pétain was removed from his position as Minister of National Defense. After only ten days of reorganization, the residual situation was handed over to Pétain.</p>
<p>As the reporter was writing this, news suddenly came that France had ordered an armistice. The detailed content has not yet been confirmed, but based on a comprehensive view of the situation from all sides, it was not absolutely unexpected that France, whose situation was so unfavorable that it could not be maintained, painfully ordered an armistice. We have not received sufficient information on this to provide a commentary. What we can say now is that the European War has taken a sharp turn. However, there are more than enough forks in the road ahead; this armistice may lead to peace, but a resumption of war is also possible. Even if that is not the case, it is not a matter of Germany winning and France losing, and everything belonging to the loser from now on belonging to the winner. How the fork in the road will lead is, of course, a matter in which the winner has a great say, but it is absolutely not something the winner can unilaterally decide everything. What will Britain do after France's armistice? This is the most pressing issue. What will be Germany's peace terms for France, and what will they be for Britain? This is the most important issue. Italy is fighting alongside Germany, but its wishes are not entirely the same. To what extent will the loser accept what Italy wants? To what extent will neutral parties outside the war, such as the Soviet Union, Spain, Turkey, and the United States, intervene for both sides? How will the naval power of Britain and France, and all the power of neutral countries, be used in determining another world in the future? All these points are key, and it is impossible to predict them at present. They will vary depending on the different evolutions. As for the Far East, it is neither integrated with the European war situation, and the nature of the problem is simple; not only can China, with its attitude of responding to all changes with constancy, overcome all encounters, but with the European war taking a sharp turn, it also allows this simple problem to be solved in the most reasonable way. Why? Because China's independence and integrity are in line with the wishes of the entire international community. Therefore, those who wrap up the news of the sharp turn in a comprehensive way must place themselves in the position of the East.</p>
<h3>French Troops Are Utterly Exhausted, Unable to Fight to the End</h3>
<p>Bordeaux Port, France: General Pétain was recently ordered by President Lebrun to form a new cabinet, and the serious situation in recent days has entered a new stage. Since the 10th of this month, Premier Reynaud has twice telegraphed U.S. President Roosevelt, appealing for assistance. In his second telegram, he also stated that the enemy's combat troops totaled 150 divisions, the richest areas of France had been occupied, French troops had been fighting hard for many days and were extremely exhausted, and at the same time, they had to protect the Alpine border. From left to right, they continued to fight, but it was difficult to sustain. When the cabinet held a meeting yesterday morning, it presented the U.S. reply for discussion. According to this reply, although the United States was still providing material assistance, the situation was urgent, and France was in a state of emergency. Premier Reynaud requested that the United States provide France with thousands of aircraft, but it was difficult to know when these aircraft would arrive. At the same time, according to reports from the military authorities, the soldiers at the front had been fighting the enemy's entire army for two weeks and were already exhausted. Because of this situation, Premier Reynaud, who had always insisted on fighting to the end, had no choice but to resign, and the situation that was left behind was handed over to Pétain. Regarding the victory in Verdun during the last European war, British Ambassador Campbell visited Premier Reynaud and presented a telegram from British Prime Minister Churchill.

<h3>A Million French Troops Surrounded Inside the Maginot Line</h3>
<p>Berlin: German military circles reported last night that German troops had completed the encirclement of the Maginot Line. One million of France's most elite troops were still holding it at 8:00 last night (5:00 this morning, Shanghai summer time). German sources said that German artillery had controlled the roads that the French army had to take to withdraw from the Rhine and Saar fronts. The German High Command declared that German troops had reached a stronghold six miles from the Swiss border and 160 miles from the Italian border. (United Press dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>Paris: Hitler's powerful mechanized forces, advancing at a speed of fifty miles per day, are passing through France and advancing towards the Swiss border, attempting to completely surround one million of France's best troops defending the Maginot Line. As the German mechanized forces attacked the rear of the Maginot Line, the German army on the western front, under the cover of aircraft and artillery, launched a fierce attack on the fortifications of the Maginot Line, whose battle line was one hundred miles long. The German army had crossed the Rhine River in several places, attempting to break through the Maginot Line, the purpose of which was to prevent the French army in the north of the Maginot Line from retreating south before the German mechanized forces operating in the Maginot Line reached the Swiss border. (United Press dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden: According to a London radio broadcast last night, German troops have reached the vicinity of Dieden, eastern France. The German army west of Paris is doing quite well. The German army is advancing south from Paris, and the French army continues to retreat. The French army in Alsace and Lorraine has collapsed. (Haitong dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>Bordeaux: It is heard that the German side has deployed all its tank corps to assist the German army in launching sweeping operations from the east, west, and north, attempting to encircle the flanks of the Maginot Line. It is heard that part of the garrison of the line has withdrawn, and the French army on the Paris front is retreating south. The German army is not pursuing them, but is instead camping near Paris to defend it. According to a French radio reporter, the German side has only been able to achieve the war results of the past few days by taking advantage of its enormous superiority in troops and materials. The German High Command has deployed all its military force, totaling 150 divisions, to participate in the Western Front campaign, so the military force stationed in the German territory must have been reduced, and is only sufficient to maintain order in Poland. The German army in the Normandy area does not seem to want to continue to advance west, but is instead holding the line between Vernon and Chartres. The French army fighting on the Paris front has been able to withdraw without being harassed by the German side. Although Paris has been occupied, it remains safe and dignified. After the French army's positions in the Champagne area were broken through, the war situation became more serious. The German army in that area launched a fierce attack, breaking through the French army's positions in Chateaud Thierry and Montaigne Trelm, and advancing in all directions towards the Rhone River, the Seine River, and the Aube River, reaching the Sens and Troyes areas. The German army's offensive in the Aumont area was the fiercest, reaching Puttatel, and the area further north and east of Verdun, because after the German army broke through the Champagne front, it spread out in a fan shape. On Friday, the German army launched a fierce attack in Mermel, attempting to break through the French army's line of defense, but failed. The German army near Le Blanc Lesault launched another attack yesterday, but was repulsed to the other side of the river. However, some German troops have occupied a bridgehead. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>
<h3>German Troops Advance Towards the Franco-Swiss Border; French Refugees Enter Switzerland</h3>
<p>Geneva: According to a Swiss newspaper, German armored convoys are passing through the Langres Highlands and advancing towards the Franco-Swiss border. The French High Command is working hard to rescue the French troops in that area. At the same time, the Swiss military authorities are also preparing to detain French troops who retreat into Switzerland. The newspaper continued that French refugees are fleeing to Switzerland in droves. The province of Pruntrut has already taken in 10,000 refugees. Many French refugees have also arrived in the town of Freiles, Neuchâtel. The elderly and children have been sent to the interior, and all schools have been set up as refugee camps. (Haitong dispatch, 17th)</p>

<h3>German War Report</h3>
<p>Berlin. A German military expert yesterday gave a supplementary war report to the Haitong News Agency reporter, declaring that most of the French front lines had collapsed or were on the verge of collapse. The main military facts are as follows: (1) After the collapse of the French army, the German army achieved victorious progress from the English Channel to Switzerland; (2) The German army is southeast of Paris, only one hundred kilometers from the Swiss border; (3) The Verdun fortress has fallen into the hands of the German army; (4) The Maginot Line has been breached at several key strongholds, and Longuyon in the west has also been occupied by the German army. Based on the above four points, it proves that the German army has crossed the Rhine River and its left army is advancing towards Alsace. (Haitong Telegram, 17th)</p>
<p>Hitler's Headquarters. This year's German war report claims that the defeated French army is fleeing southwest, and the German army is in hot pursuit.

Yesterday, a fast train departing from Marseilles arrived at Besançon station and saw German tank formations occupying the station. This fast train was full of French soldiers on leave, who mistook the tank formations for those sent by the British. Only after being captured did they realize that the area was already in the hands of the German army. (Haitong Telegram, 17th)</p>

It is said that the first act of the German attack on Iceland will be a joint attack by naval and air forces, followed by the occupation of the island by land forces. It is widely believed that if Germany occupies Iceland, it will greatly facilitate its attack on Britain. (United Press Telegram, 17th)</p>

<h3>Yichang City Lost and Regained, Chinese Launch General Offensive Near Jingzhou and Shashi, Remaining Japanese in City Completely Eliminated</h3>
<p>Yichang. Starting from the 13th, fierce street fighting occurred between Chinese and Japanese forces in Dongguan, Yichang. On the 15th, the Chinese army implemented a new deployment, and the Japanese entered the city of Yichang, continuing to engage in bloody battles with the Chinese in the northwestern suburbs of Yichang. Seeing that the Japanese had penetrated deep into the city and had not yet established a foothold, the Chinese armies launched a general offensive that night from Jingzhou to Jingmen.

<h3>Soviet Union Controls the Baltic Sea; Red Army Enters Latvia and Estonia; Warships Simultaneously Enter Riga Port; Latvia and Estonia Accept the Soviet Ultimatum to Reorganize Their Governments</h3>
<p>Moscow: Regarding the relations between the Soviet Union and Latvia and Estonia, TASS has released the following announcement: On June 16th, the People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union, Molotov, representing the Soviet government, submitted a protest note to the Latvian envoy Guchins for transmission to the Latvian government. The protest note stated, "According to the information available to the Soviet Union, and the results of the conversation between Molotov and the Lithuanian Prime Minister Merkys, the Soviet government believes that the facts are extremely clear. The Latvian government has not only failed to cancel the military alliance with Estonia (which was established before the conclusion of the Soviet-Latvian Mutual Assistance Treaty and was aimed at the Soviet Union), but has also further attempted to include Lithuania and even Finland in this alliance. Although this military alliance contradicted the Soviet-Latvian Non-Aggression Pact before the conclusion of the Soviet-Latvian Mutual Assistance Treaty in the autumn of 1939, the Soviet Union could still ignore the existence of this military alliance. However, after the conclusion of the Soviet-Latvian Mutual Assistance Treaty, the Soviet government believes that this alliance of Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania, aimed at the Soviet Union, is not only intolerable to the Soviet Union, but also threatens the security of the Soviet borders. The Soviet government originally expected that after the conclusion of the Soviet-Latvian Mutual Assistance Treaty, Latvia would withdraw from the military alliance with other Baltic countries, thereby canceling the alliance. But Latvia has not only failed to do so, but has expanded the military alliance with other Baltic countries. This can be proven by the following facts: (1) In December 1939 and March 1940, the three Baltic countries convened two secret meetings, attempting to expand the military alliance. (2) The staff officers of Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania intensified cooperation without letting the Soviet Union know. (3) In February 1940, the Baltic Small Entente published a journal called the 'Baltic Review,' which was printed in English, French, and German. The above facts prove that the Latvian government has violated the Soviet-Latvian Mutual Assistance Treaty, because according to Article 4 of the treaty, neither party shall join any alliance aimed at the other party. Furthermore, this behavior that violates the Soviet-Latvian Mutual Assistance Treaty is contrary to the Soviet Union's kindness and pro-Latvian policy, as well as the Soviet side's respect for the spirit of the treaty. The Soviet government believes that this situation cannot be tolerated. Latvia must implement the following conditions: (1) Latvia should immediately form a government that can abide by the Soviet-Latvian Mutual Assistance Treaty. (2) Soviet troops may be stationed at various important points in Latvia, with a number sufficient to maintain the implementation of the Mutual Assistance Treaty and respond to any provocative actions. The Soviet government believes that this requirement is a prerequisite for implementation. On the same day, Guchins submitted the Latvian government's reply to the Soviet side, stating that the Latvian government fully accepts the demands made by the Soviet government. On June 16th, Molotov also submitted a protest note to the Estonian envoy Reis, for transmission to the Estonian government. The wording was the same as the Soviet side's note to the Latvian government. On the same day, Reis submitted the Estonian government's reply to the Soviet side, stating that the Estonian government fully accepts the conditions put forward by the Soviet government. (TASS dispatch from the 17th)</p>
<p>Berlin: According to sources, Latvia accepted the Soviet ultimatum last night and is forming a new government in Riga. The Red Army is scheduled to enter Latvian territory today. The Estonian government has officially announced that Soviet troops will enter Estonian territory "to be stationed in areas not yet garrisoned by the Soviet Union." The Estonian government has resigned after discussing the Soviet conditions. The Soviet side claims that the Soviet ultimatum to Latvia and Estonia stipulated that they must reply by 11:00 PM last night (5:00 AM Shanghai summer time today), otherwise, Soviet troops would automatically occupy the two countries at midnight yesterday. The Soviet demands do not require the Red Army to occupy all parts of Latvia and Estonia, but only to occupy the most important cities, similar to what the Red Army occupied in Lithuania last week.

The Lithuanian government has issued a statement saying that due to the international situation and the development of the war, it is necessary to increase the number of Soviet troops stationed in Lithuania to strengthen the security of Eastern Europe. The Commander-in-Chief of the Lithuanian Army has also issued an order calling the Soviet troops allied troops. Merkys broadcast last night, urging the Lithuanian people to make a correct judgment of the overall situation, saying that we believe that the arrival of another batch of Soviet troops in Lithuania is to ensure greater security for Lithuania and the Soviet Union.

<h3>Dutch East Indies Fears Japanese Invasion, Eagerly Awaits American Aid, While Also Seeking to Increase Trade to Eliminate Difficulties with Tokyo</h3>
<p>Batavia: Today, people in the Dutch East Indies are very anxious about the possibility of Germany winning in Europe and Japan suddenly attacking from the south. The reality of these two possibilities is enough to force the relatively weak and powerless Dutch territory to seek protection immediately. At present, the only hope of the Dutch people here is to look to the United States for guidance and assistance. However, the 125,000 Dutch people who manage this vast tropical empire still have doubts about the extent of protection that the United States can provide to protect the status quo in Southeast Asia. The United States has a great need for the tin, rubber, and oil produced in the Dutch East Indies. The Dutch people believe that this fact may lead the United States to provide assistance in the event of an invasion of the Dutch East Indies. Twenty percent of the world's tin is produced in the Dutch East Indies, and the United States is the largest customer of the Dutch East Indies. The United States has invested approximately $200 million in the Dutch East Indies' rubber industry, and American companies own 40% of the $300 million invested in the oil mines of Borneo. However, the number of Americans residing in the Dutch East Indies is very small. In Batavia, there are 60 Americans, half of whom are women and children. After the German invasion of the Netherlands, they were either evacuated to Australia or returned to the United States. The first terror that occurred here after Germany controlled the Netherlands was the fear that Germany would extend its power to the Dutch East Indies, because there are currently 7,500 Germans residing in the Dutch East Indies, and 400 of them hold positions in government agencies. Secondly, 10% of the Dutch people here are pro-German. When the news of the German invasion of the Netherlands arrived, the police quickly detained more than 5,000 Germans and some pro-Germans on a small island near Bavaria, Onrust Island, within three hours, and confiscated German property worth US$100 million. The German club in Bavaria became a temporary police station. The Dutch officials' handling of this matter was very agile. Of the 17 German ships docked in various ports of the Dutch East Indies, only one escaped, and the remaining 16 were detained by the Dutch authorities, with a total tonnage of 116,000 tons. After repairs, the detained German ships were re-flagged as Dutch and carried passengers. The detained Germans included members of the Nazi Party, non-Nazis, and Jews, all imprisoned in the same place. It is said that conflicts and riots often occur among these people. According to Dutch officials, some Germans have been executed by firing squad. Although the Dutch have eliminated the Germans, they still do not feel happy, because every Dutch person in the Dutch East Indies has family members in their home country. As traffic between the Dutch East Indies and the Netherlands has been cut off by the Germans, the Dutch people in the Dutch East Indies know nothing about the situation in their motherland. Therefore, the Dutch people here are all depressed and unhappy. Nightclubs are deserted, and there are few guests in the banquet halls. After eliminating the Germans, the second fear in the Dutch East Indies is the increasing possibility of Japanese invasion. The defense forces of the island, including Europeans, Eurasians, and local indigenous troops, total approximately 60,000 people. In addition, there are hundreds of American-style fighter jets, hundreds of coastal artillery pieces, several submarines, four cruisers, and destroyers. The Dutch authorities firmly believe that if they obtain foreign assistance, the current military force can temporarily prevent the advance of invaders before foreign assistance arrives. Several weeks ago, the rumors about Japanese activities subsided slightly, but now the Dutch people, while hoping for the victory of the Allied forces, are also trying to increase trade to eliminate difficulties with Tokyo, and feel that they are at a crossroads. The export goods of various European countries are no longer coming to the Dutch East Indies, and only products from the United States and Japan are available to supply these 60,000 residents, giving American and Japanese trade an excellent position. Merchants in Batavia, who have always traded with Europe, have had to change their plans and establish relationships with American manufacturers because they cannot import European goods. In the past, there were various restrictions on trade with the Dutch East Indies, and most commodities were monopolized by Dutch manufacturers. For example, according to government regulations, only Dutch manufacturers could sell radios in Java. Now this patent will be stopped, because the authorities strictly inspect newspapers, and people here are not restricted in their use of radios. In the past, German goods sold well here, but now they have been replaced by American and Japanese goods. Relations with the United States and Japan have become very close. From 1929 to 1934, Japanese exports to the Dutch East Indies accounted for 32% of the total imports of the Dutch East Indies, which was enough to satisfy its trade in the Dutch East Indies and was larger than that of the Netherlands. However, the Dutch East Indies' exports to Japan only accounted for 5% of its total imports. After 1934, the Dutch East Indies decided to increase the import of British and Dutch goods and suppress the import of Japanese goods. By 1938, Japan accounted for 15%. Today, business circles here believe that the European market in the Dutch East Indies will be replaced by American and Japanese goods as much as possible. If so, then on the one hand, it is an act of good neighborliness towards Japan, and on the other hand, it can hope for the friendly assistance of the United States.

<h3>America Denies Joint Control of Vietnam with Britain and France; Eastern Newspaper Reports Britain and America Have Signed a Secret Agreement</h3>
<p>Washington: Officials here are not commenting on the news reported by the Tokyo Nichinichi Shimbun that the United States has secretly negotiated with Britain and France on the issue of joint control of Indochina. However, well-informed sources do not believe this rumor. According to them, it is legally impossible for the United States to secretly negotiate with other countries on defense plans outside its own territory unless Congress grants this power. Judging from the repeated decisions of Congress in recent years, the policy of the United States is to firmly oppose all plans to infringe upon the Far East and to move towards clearing up the current infringements on the Far East, such as the rule of the Philippines. The US executive branch cannot independently engage in the defense of new areas abroad without the express permission of Congress. Well-informed sources also commented on the news reported by the Nichinichi Shimbun that Britain, America, and France will jointly defend Australia and New Caledonia, saying that regarding the defense of these two places, it seems too early given Britain's current intense engagement in war. The United States may consider establishing a permanent relationship with Australia, but any active action must be approved by Congress. (United Press Dispatch from the 17th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: A spokesperson for the Japanese Foreign Ministry stated that the news published in the "Nichinichi Shimbun" that the Japanese army in South China is determined to prevent the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway from transporting military supplies to China is a fact. This decision to cut off the supply of military supplies is an absolutely necessary measure for the Japanese army, but the specific method to be adopted has not yet been announced. The spokesperson continued that whether to attack the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway at present will be decided by the Japanese military authorities in that area. (Haitong News Agency Dispatch from the 17th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: According to the "Nichinichi Shimbun," Britain and America have signed a secret agreement stipulating the joint defense measures for British and French territories and the Dutch East Indies in the Pacific. The newspaper claimed that, according to reliable sources, the Allied powers have suffered setbacks in the war in Europe and can no longer control their territories in the Pacific. These territories are in the same situation as the Dutch East Indies. At present, Britain and America have signed a secret agreement regarding these territories. Negotiations are also underway on the issue of joint British, American, and French management of Vietnam. The newspaper continued that the Japanese government should immediately pay attention to this development, and that Vietnam is important to Japan both geographically and economically. It goes without saying that Japan firmly opposes this joint management plan. Japan should immediately take diplomatic countermeasures. Vietnam's hostile attitude towards Japan has been proven by its actions in transporting military supplies to the Chinese government. Japan must demand that this hostile attitude be stopped immediately. (Haitong News Agency Dispatch from the 17th)</p>
<h3>Irish Parties Unite to Defend Neutrality Policy; Abandoning Prejudices to Protect Freedom</h3>
<p>Dublin: The largest gathering in Dublin in many years was held yesterday inside the Irish university, demonstrating the country's determination to defend Ireland's neutrality policy with all its resources. The leaders of the three parties in the parliament, namely Valera, Cosgrave, and Griffiths, all addressed the assembled crowd, saying that all parties have abandoned prejudices and are now united as one party to protect Ireland's freedom.

The entire resources of the country must be used, supported by the courage and unity of the Irish people. Valera also said, "This danger is increasing its threat as time passes. When your neighbor's house is on fire, and sparks are falling on your roof, there is no time for much talk. We will have to suspend some government activities temporarily to prepare for self-defense. If your freedom has been taken away, then talking about freedom is useless." (Reuters Dispatch from the 17th)</p>
<h3>Syrian Muslims' Anti-Italian Movement</h3>
<p>London: A Beirut dispatch from Syria states that Italy's entry into the war to help Germany has aroused the anger of Muslims and Arabs. On June 14th, thousands of Muslims at the Omar mosque in Beirut listened to the Imam describe the situation of Muslims being abused in Tripoli, Italian Abyssinia, and Albania. The Imam warned the faithful that Italy harbored ambitions to occupy Arab countries, including the two holy cities of Mecca and Medina. Today, the Archbishop issued a statement saying that Muslims and Arabs are extremely indignant at Italy's entry into the war and standing on the side of Germany, and pray to God to protect and enable justice to triumph over aggression. The leader of the Syrian government declared that at this critical time, Arabs and Muslims are even more eager than before to stand on the side of the Allied powers, because they know that if the Allied powers unfortunately lose the war, they will suffer the same fate.

<h3>British Ambassador Sir Kerr Arrives in Shanghai, Embassy Office Becomes Active, Decision on Whether to Go North for Summer Has Not Been Made</h3>
<p>The news of Sir Kerr's arrival in Shanghai has attracted much attention. According to sources close to the embassy yesterday, the British Ambassador has come to Shanghai, and facts prove this. The British Embassy office in Shanghai is located on the Bund at the intersection of Beijing Road, on the upper floor of Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. Whenever Sir Kerr stays in Shanghai, the police department will send two capable detectives to guard the entrance for the ambassador's safety. As long as the ambassador is in Shanghai, these special detectives will not leave.</p>
<p>Security Personnel Rediscovered</p>
<p>Since the ambassador went to Chongqing this spring, the Jardine Matheson building has been rather quiet, and even the traces of these two detectives have not been seen. The day before yesterday, it was suddenly reported that the long-departed ambassador had returned to Shanghai from Hong Kong. The two detectives mentioned above near the embassy office were also discovered at the same time, so the saying that the ambassador had indeed arrived in Shanghai seemed even more credible.</p>
<p>Black Car Parked Simultaneously</p>
<p>The embassy office also has a small British car, which is used by embassy staff for transportation during the ambassador's stay in Shanghai. This car has not been seen on the Bund for several months, but yesterday morning, this black small car was refreshed and parked on the Huangpu Bund. This is another clear proof that Sir Kerr has arrived in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Decision on Going North for Summer Has Not Yet Been Made</p>
<p>The ambassador originally planned to stay in Shanghai for a short time and then go north to Beidaihe for the summer, but the situation in Europe is changing rapidly, and the future is uncertain. The ambassador's return to Shanghai this time is not solely for escaping the heat. The decision on his movements will depend on the development of the situation. It is recently heard that fewer British and French people are going to the northern summer resort than in previous years. In the precarious situation, they have no time to seek scenic beauty, and the ambassador probably feels the same way.</p>
<p>American Ambassador to Arrive Next Month</p>
<p>American Ambassador Johnson, after postponing his departure from Chongqing, is residing in the ambassador's private residence in Chongqing and is quite comfortable. According to news received from the US Consulate, Ambassador Johnson has now decided to fly to Hong Kong from Chongqing on July 4, and then transfer to the American President Lines' President Coolidge to Shanghai, arriving at the port on the afternoon of the 9th.</p>
<h3>French Concession to Increase Taxes, Decision Within the Week, Chinese Directors to Fight For</h3>
<p>After the French Concession Municipal Council announced that it would increase various taxes from July 1 this year, the Chinese Ratepayers Association of the French Concession believes that the Municipal Council's financial income in recent years has not been in deficit. Moreover, at a time when prices are soaring and people's livelihoods are difficult, increasing taxes will only further exacerbate the situation. They sent a letter to the French Municipal Council requesting that they withdraw the order, but they have not yet received a formal reply. It is now learned that the French Municipal Council has scheduled a board meeting within this week, at which the proposal will be discussed. It is reported that the Chinese directors of the French Concession have prepared to fight at the meeting and ask the authorities to consider the difficulties of the times and exempt them from increasing taxes in order to maintain the market. The French Ratepayers Association is also deeply concerned about the issue of rent control and has designated four representatives to cooperate with the authorities.</p>
<h3>Aftermath of Nanshi Refugee Zone, 19,000 Refugees Remaining, Short Time Limit for Dispersal of Younger Refugees</h3>
<p>The quiet departure of Father Jacquinot de Bessenay, the founder of the Nanshi Refugee Zone, has attracted much attention from all sectors of society. Father Jacquinot's departure from Shanghai was purely out of his patriotic enthusiasm, as he hastily returned to his home country in response to a telegram from the charitable community to preside over relief affairs. Under the urgent circumstances of the retreat of the national army and the displacement of refugees, the Father resolutely established a refugee zone, and his kindness was universally respected by both Chinese and foreigners. It is understood that there are currently 88 ordinary shelters, 2 model shelters, 1 home for the disabled and elderly, 2 hospitals, and 2 schools for refugee children, with a total of more than 19,000 refugees still residing in the zone. The Supervisory Committee, originally organized by seven French priests and others in the zone, presides over the affairs of the entire zone, with the Father as its leader. Since the Father decided to leave Shanghai, a Follow-up Committee has been established to handle various follow-up matters. Before leaving, the Father also drafted a follow-up outline to be considered by the Follow-up Committee and the office. As of 2 pm yesterday, the Follow-up Committee had begun discussions, attended by Gu Lun, director of the Refugee Zone Office, and Jasper, the French Vice Consul in Shanghai. The French side advocated that from yesterday, younger refugees should be given half a month's worth of food, and they should be completely dispersed by the end of this month. However, Gu and others requested that the period for issuing food be extended to the 15th of next month so that the refugees would have the opportunity to find a way out after dispersal. It is heard that the dispersal date has not yet been agreed upon, but due to the lack of funds, the refugees will be given food and travel expenses, while the elderly and weak will be transferred to the Puyu Hall.</p>
<h3>Fire on S.S. Erebus, Loss of £1,000</h3>
<p>The British Steam Navigation Company's regular ship on the China-India route, the S.S. Erebus, arrived in Shanghai from Bombay last Thursday with a large batch of cotton, a total of 22,300 bales, and docked at Qichang Wharf in Pudong to unload. On Saturday (the 15th) morning, while unloading, the cotton in the fourth hold suddenly caught fire. It was not extinguished until about 3 pm. The cotton in the hold that had not been burned was completely soaked in water, and the hold was overflowing with water that had not yet been drained. It is heard that the hull was also slightly damaged and will be moved to a certain pier in Pudong today to first remove the wet cotton and drain the water from the hold before repairing the hull. The ship's return to India will have to be slightly delayed. According to the shipowner's report to the company, the loss due to carelessness is valued at £1,000. The cause of the fire is unknown and is currently under investigation.</p>
<h3>66 People Arrested in Hangzhou, According to Japanese Claims</h3>
<p>According to Japanese claims, last month, the Japanese military police detachment stationed in Hangzhou cracked a major "spy organization," with as many as 66 people being reported. Among them, Yang Shilin, who had served in the military under the Zhejiang Security Office, recently joined the Hangzhou Japanese military police detachment and, with many companions, collected military and political information of the Japanese and puppet regimes to supply to the Chinese side, and planned to find an opportunity to assassinate important figures of the puppet regime. Unexpectedly, the matter was not kept secret and was detected by the Japanese military police detachment. They began to search and arrest on the 25th of last month. As of the 28th, Yang and his companions arrested numbered 66.</p>
<h3>British Customs Commissioner of Jianghai Customs, Mr. Rohde, Not Retired, Customs Authorities Deny, Rumors of Successor Even More Inaccurate</h3>
<p>Yesterday, it was rumored that "British Customs Commissioner of Jianghai Customs, Mr. Rohde, will have completed his 35-year term on November 22 of this year and will retire at that time." It was also said that the vacancy would be filled by one of Ding Guitang, Lu Bin, or British Azimut. Japanese Kishimoto Yoshihiro was also quite active for this position. Ping Ming News Agency reporters specifically inquired about this with the General Customs Administration and the Jianghai Customs, and both denied it. The Customs authorities stated that Customs Commissioner Rohde has no intention of retiring, and the so-called appointment by Ding Guitang or other Chinese or British personnel is even more inaccurate. Moreover, for example, the Customs Commissioner of Tianjin Customs had long been fulfilled his term, but continues to hold the position.</p>
<h3>Morning Bloodbath on Avenue Edward VII, Liu Ronggui Assassinated, Thugs Planned and Waited, All Three Bullets Hit Vital Spots, Died on the Spot, Liu was the Inspector-in-Chief of the Central Police Station's Shanghai East District C</h3>

There were ten thugs, all of whom fled without a trace after the incident. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Left Home Early to Wait for Tram</p>
<p>Liu Ronggui, Inspector-in-Chief of Shanghai East District C, also known as Youqing, was 52 years old, from Wuxi, and lived at No. 20 Wende Lane, at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Rue Petit. After the war, he was transferred to the Central Police Station on Fuzhou Road. He was known to be forthright, frugal, and admirable. At about 8:15 yesterday morning, Liu was wearing a yellow uniform and black leather shoes, and as usual, he went to the police station for office work. He walked out of his house and took a few dozen steps to the tram stop at the intersection of Rue Petit, waiting for Tram No. 1 or 2. Unexpectedly, there were about ten thugs lying in ambush, dressed in various styles of long gowns and short jackets. Seeing Liu Ronggui approaching,</p>
<p>Thugs Surrounded Him and He Was Shot to Death</p>
<p>Six thugs rushed up and surrounded him. Four of them were wearing white silk shirts and pants and took out their guns to snipe. At that time, Liu was caught off guard and quickly pulled out his service pistol from his waist to fight back, but he had already been hit in three vital spots by ruthless bullets: one in the left temple, one in the right neck, and one in the back. The bullets did not penetrate, and he collapsed, blood gushing out like a spring. He died on the spot. Seeing that their goal had been achieved, the thugs fled in a swarm. By the time the nearby patrol officers heard the alarm and rushed to the scene, they were long gone. After being notified by neighbors, Liu's wife, Ms. Yu, together with his eldest daughter, Liu Suxia, a lawyer, rushed to the scene, mourning over the body with great grief, almost fainting.</p>
<p>Body Has Been Examined, Full Funeral Tomorrow</p>
<p>After the incident, the Jing'an Temple Police Station was notified and quickly dispatched a large number of armed detectives and troops to the scene to investigate and collect bullet casings, which were taken back to the police station for examination. The body of Liu was transported to the Shanghai International Settlement Police Hospital on Shanhai Pass Road. In the afternoon, a member was dispatched by the court to examine the body.

<h3>Difficulties in Sending Parcels to Europe, Post Office Tries to Maintain Service, Acceptance of Parcels Transiting Through Italy Has Been Suspended, Shanghai Postmaster Zha Peilin Departed for Yunnan Yesterday</h3>
<p>Shanghai Postal Administration Notice No. 1623 states that because Italian postal ships have stopped sailing, the acceptance of all parcels to Italy and countries transiting through Italy is suspended from today. Furthermore, since Italy's participation in the war, the situation in Europe has become even more dangerous. Therefore, the parcel route on which the Bureau relied to transport parcels to most European countries has been cut off. As a result, this Bureau is unable to handle parcels to Europe and parcels transiting through Europe. However, this Bureau will still do its best to maintain parcel business from Shanghai to Europe within the possible scope to benefit the public. This notice is hereby issued for general knowledge. Director: Zha Peilin (on official business), Assistant Director: Wang Weisheng (acting), June 15, Republic of China Year 29.</p>
<p>Mr. Zha Peilin</p>
<p>Postmaster Zha Peilin boarded the French Far East Mail Company's mail ship Datnan yesterday to depart from Shanghai and transfer to Kunming General Office to meet with Mr. Guo Xinsong to report on the current postal affairs in the Shanghai district and the current status of postal facilities in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui guerrilla war zones.

<h3>Rice Prices Rise Again, People's Food Supply Becomes Serious Again, Decision on Continuing to Provide Low-Priced Rice to Be Made Next Month</h3>
<p>Rice prices in the city have risen again recently, and the problem of people's food supply has become serious again. Social stability is also threatened. If a solution is not sought quickly, the future is very worrying. According to inquiries from the Rice Industry Association yesterday, the city's rice reserves have always been abundant. However, taking advantage of the long exchange rate, rice merchants in the city have repeatedly ordered foreign rice, with the amount being between 300,000 and 400,000 bags in the past half month. They will be shipped to Shanghai successively in early July. The future of people's food supply is originally not a concern. It is only because it is being manipulated by others that it is difficult to effectively ban it.</p>
<p>Do Not Believe Rumors</p>
<p>To stabilize the rice market, in addition to cooperation between the authorities and the market to strictly ban speculators from entering the market, the greatest effectiveness is to not easily believe rumors. For example, recently in the market, there has been a so-called rumor that the inland areas are competing to purchase foreign rice from the city, which is actually groundless. Although rice prices in the inland areas are higher than before, the highest price per picul is about 50 yuan, while the lowest rice price per picul in the city is more than 50 yuan. There is no reason to purchase rice from the city. As for the Zhen rice in Zhejiang, as early as two months ago, only 5,000 bags were purchased from the city. After being transported to Ningbo, it was blocked by the Japanese and has been transported directly from the production area. If the rumor that the authorities have cancelled the price limit is used as a reason for the rise in domestic rice prices, it is even more wrong. A reporter inquired from relevant parties yesterday and learned that the authorities have not made such regulations. However, in order to encourage vendors to purchase as much as possible, they may consider their freight costs, but they will still strictly ban those who raise prices.</p>
<p>Low-Priced Rice Next Month</p>
<p>With rice prices rising so high, the general poor people are unable to afford to buy rice to feed themselves. In order to provide relief, it is imperative to rush to provide low-priced rice. Mr. Yu Qiaqing said that in order to rush to provide low-priced rice, various procedures are being actively carried out, and it has been decided to start next month. He will convene a meeting of the low-priced rice committee members next week to discuss the work in progress, but the amount of money required is huge, and he still hopes that all sectors will donate generously.</p>
<h3>Car Accident Causes Tragedy: One Man and Two Women Killed</h3>
<p>A native of Ningbo, Xu Yuxiang, aged 25, used to work as a carpenter in Yuanlai. Recently, he came to Shanghai to seek a living, staying at his relative's home at No. 120 Sapo Sai Road in the French Concession. At 8:50 PM on the 15th, while crossing the road from north to south near No. 429 Xiafei Road near Luban Road, he was struck by private car No. 3918, owned by Dr. Qian Enze of No. 455 Lane 15 Jing'an Temple Road. The car was driven by the chauffeur Wu Yuting (age 42, from Tongzhou) at high speed. Xu was unable to avoid it and was knocked seven or eight feet away, falling to the ground. His left calf bone was crushed. Police officers arrived, sent Xu to Guangci Hospital, and detained the chauffeur in the police station. Xu succumbed to his injuries and died at 2:30 AM the following morning. The police sent the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Mortuary for examination. Yesterday, the authorities examined the body, and Xu Ruiyuan, the deceased’s uncle, claimed it. The defendant was sent to court by the police for legal proceedings.</p>
<p>Wu Yushu, the manager of the Jiaotong Bank branch at No. 678 Haig Road, owned private car No. 909. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, it was driven by chauffeur Xie Ronghua (age 35, from Chongming), speeding westwards along Fuxu Road near Guba Road and Hede Road. In front of No. 1085, a woman in her twenties was crossing the road. Both parties were unable to avoid each other, resulting in the woman being knocked down and her head and waist crushed, causing immediate death. Police officers arrived, detained the chauffeur, and sent the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Mortuary for examination. Yesterday, the authorities examined the body, but since they were unable to ascertain the identity of the deceased, the body was handed over to the Charity Hall for burial, pending identification by relatives. The defendant was sent to court by the police for legal proceedings.</p>
<p>Madam Chen Luo, an elderly woman from Jiangbei, aged 70, lived at No. 700 Xiaoshadu Road. At around 7:30 PM last night, while walking alone at the intersection of Jiaozhou Road and Xinzha Road, she was suddenly struck by a speeding transport vehicle of unknown number. Unable to avoid it, she was knocked down on the spot, fatally crushing her head, resulting in immediate death.</p>
<h3>Gangsters Assault and Wound a Fake Policeman and Foreman</h3>
<p>Xu Qingquan, aged 29, from Anhui, is the foreman of the Tongli Towel Factory at No. 4 Ye Qin Village, Dunxin Road, in Western Shanghai. He has been working at the factory for three years. The area is located outside the concession boundaries, and gangsters are rampant, engaging in robbery and extortion. Two gangsters from the neighborhood came to the factory on the 16th (the day before yesterday) to demand festival fees and were given ten national currency dollars, after which they left. The next day, they returned to the factory, demanding more money. A fake policeman named Gao, who was on guard duty, prevented them from entering, and they held a grudge. Yesterday afternoon, the gangsters returned with accomplices, armed with handguns, axes, iron rods, and other weapons, waiting at the factory entrance. When the fake policeman Gao went on duty, they used the axe handle to strike Gao's head and face. Xu was standing and watching during the assault when one of the gangsters struck him on both legs twice with an axe, and once on his left arm, causing profuse bleeding. It is reported that two of the assailants were apprehended on the spot and taken to the fake police station for investigation. The injured Xu Qingquan was hired a car and sent to Tongren Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Prices Continue to Plummet: Speculation Leads to Suicide; Ding Chunfang from Wuxi Loses His Life</h3>
<p>Ding Chunfang, a native of Wuxi, aged 34, residing at No. 24 Rongkang Villa, Shantieh Road, was a cotton yarn merchant. Recently, due to speculation in cotton yarn, prices continued to plummet, resulting in losses of over 300,000 yuan, leaving him bankrupt and heavily indebted. Overwhelmed by remorse, Ding contemplated suicide. Yesterday morning at around 2:00 AM, he suddenly ingested raw opium in an attempt to take his own life. When his family discovered it, they rushed him to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment, but the poisoning was too severe, and he died at around 3:00 AM this morning. After the examination yesterday, the body was moved to the Leyuan Funeral Home for preparation. This is truly a warning to speculators.</p>
<h3>Father Jacquinot's Departure Thoughts</h3>
<p>— Zhao Weiqian</p>
<p>One or two days before the fall of Paris, there was news that Father Jacquinot was preparing to leave Shanghai and return to his country. Unfortunately, the French army retreated, and the German army had already entered the bustling city of Paris. Although the French expatriates in Shanghai encouraged each other via radio with "Don't be discouraged, don't lose heart," a picture of refugees in exile had already been placed before us.</p>
<p>A Reuters Air Force correspondent said: He drove over fifty miles through a sea of people and witnessed the refugee population like a tidal wave. The endurance of these refugees is admirable... Although the refugees' eyes showed exhaustion, there were few tears. Children sitting amidst boxes and clutter often showed smiles, as if to indicate that they did not feel pain from this long journey. The elderly were sleeping due to exhaustion, their wrinkled and resolute faces seeming to maintain determination even in their sleep. The vehicles driven by the refugees mostly carried two items: one was straw mats, to serve as bedding when there was no place to stay; the other was a bicycle, to temporarily replace the car when it broke down or the horses became too tired.</p>
<p>Father Jacquinot was kind and compassionate. During both the January 28th Incident and the August 13th Incident, he provided aid to Chinese refugees, truly a "living Buddha" with universal praise. Now, the refugees of France—Father Jacquinot's compatriots—were running along the exile line, struggling at the forefront of the war. Father Jacquinot could not remain unmoved. Encouraged by the French authorities, he resolutely and silently bid farewell to his second hometown of China and tens of thousands of beloved refugees. He quietly boarded a ship from the Huangpu River to cross the West to the United States of America, and then returned to the embrace of France, "born here, fed here, grown here." Temporarily abandoning the refugees in the East, he devoted himself to comforting the refugees in the West. Undoubtedly, this was all due to the war, keeping a peace envoy extremely busy, running east and west. He was already a sixty-seven-year-old man with white hair!</p>
<p>During this Sino-Japanese War, Father Jacquinot went to the refugee camps every day to work, until the day before his departure. His departure was hasty. While packing, he still handled many affairs: the most important was the issue of refugee resettlement. Originally, due to severe financial constraints, the number of refugees in Nanshi was gradually decreasing. After Father Jacquinot's departure, the elderly and weak refugees would temporarily be cared for by the Xin Puyu Hall as usual, while the young and strong refugees would be encouraged to seek a living, and they would be given half a month's rations. Refugees are the most sympathetic people in the world because they know that what is most needed in hardship is the sympathy and comfort of others. Father Jacquinot's work over the past few years can be described as benevolent and righteous. How could the refugees not be moved? They prepared to erect a bronze statue of Father Jacquinot to commemorate him forever. Therefore, on Saturday morning, each person held a brick and first held a solemn cornerstone laying ceremony for the bronze statue. They also wanted to change Fangbang Road in the city to Jacquinot Road, and Fangbang Bridge to Jacquinot Bridge, to commemorate his departure thoughts. However, they were powerless, lacking both financial resources and influence. To put these noble ideals of honoring virtue and repaying kindness into practice would have to wait for another day. Among the refugee children was a boy named Lin Yusheng, who was exceptionally intelligent. Father Jacquinot often loved to chat with him in Shanghai dialect during his spare time. Recently, due to his imminent departure from China, he donated ten yuan to the Xushi Bank as his education savings. Gu Lun, Father Jacquinot's private secretary, had a teacher-student relationship with Father Jacquinot at Aurora University. In recent years, his assistance in charity work has been tireless. Therefore, Father Jacquinot regarded him as a right-hand man and gave him a photo with a few sentences inscribed on it: "You contribute to God and the motherland, exerting your intelligence to the fullest. You are worthy of being my left hand!" In these few words, it can be seen that Father Jacquinot was sincere, easily grateful to others, and also very humorous, because he himself lost an arm and only had a right hand, hence "worthy of being my left hand."</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Shanghai War in 1937, Father Jacquinot established the Nanshi Refugee Zone, which was highly valued by both the Chinese and Japanese sides. Later, with the advancement of North America, he aroused the sympathy and attention of the American people, benefiting refugees throughout the country. As a result, relief efforts were able to proceed smoothly. The Chongqing National Government, recognizing Father Jacquinot's contribution to humanity and culture, recently presented him with a sapphire-colored jade medal, which Father Jacquinot regarded as a great honor and often wore. Father Jacquinot said to his friend yesterday: "China is my hometown, I deeply love China. Although I am temporarily returning to Europe this time, I will return soon." He recently changed his name from "Jacquinot" to "Jacquinot Hua," words from the heart. We know his motive for changing his name based on the meaning of the name. He is indeed an international friend who deeply loves China.</p>
<h3>Young Woman Pregnant, Accuses Timber Merchant of Abandonment, Demands 67,200 Yuan; Defendant Claims to be the Woman's Adoptive Grandfather</h3>
<p>Cai Junfu, a wealthy timber merchant from Chaoyang, Guangdong, aged 52, residing at No. 3, Lane 222, Malong Road, operates timber businesses in both Caojiadu and Tianjin, also engaging in transportation and purchasing, and possessing considerable assets. Recently, Cai Li Cuiying, a young woman from Sichuan (age 20), retained lawyer Li Wenjie and filed a criminal complaint in the Second Special District Court, accusing him of</p>
<p>Abandonment and neglecting her living, requesting that he be punished accordingly. She also filed a civil suit. The case was heard by judge Zhang Mingsheng yesterday. The plaintiff was unable to appear in court due to childbirth and was represented by her lawyer, who stated the plaintiff's case, roughly as follows: The plaintiff went to Tianjin in September last year to visit relatives and resided in a hotel. She met the defendant, who was doing business in Tianjin, residing in the same hotel. They became acquainted, and the defendant, admiring the plaintiff's youth and beauty,</p>
<p>Under his sweet words and enticements, they formally began cohabitating in the defendant's shop on Zhengxing Street in the Chinese area of Tianjin in September of last year. In March of this year, she accompanied the plaintiff on the Yihua Company's Dingsheng ship to Shanghai, first residing at the East Asia Hotel on Nanjing Road. Later, because the plaintiff was about to give birth, he rented the remaining house of lawyer Wu Huatai at No. 4 Meilanfang, Belle Road. The lease stated that the plaintiff was the defendant's family member. After moving in, everything was peaceful, but not long after, the defendant</p>
<p>Disappeared and did not return. She inquired everywhere and learned that the defendant resided at No. 3, Lane 222, Malong Road and had telephone number 83305. She telephoned to inquire about the defendant's whereabouts. She happened to speak to him and questioned him, but he prevaricated. He still did not come. She then hired a lawyer to send a letter questioning him, but he ignored it. The plaintiff is a young and weak woman, far from home, and after being violated by him, he maliciously abandoned her. In</p>
<p>Amidst grief and anger, she suffered a miscarriage while seven months pregnant (the issue of the infant is temporarily reserved). The defendant abandoned her, which is unforgivable in both law and morality. Reluctantly, she requested that he be punished according to the law and also requested in the civil suit that he be ordered to pay 67,200 yuan (280 yuan per month, calculated for 20 years). The defendant arrived in court with his defense lawyer and stated that he met the plaintiff in November of last year at the</p>
<p>Paris Hotel in the French Concession of Tianjin. He went there with friends to play cards. In March of this year, the defendant came to Shanghai on the Dingsheng ship. After arriving in Shanghai, because they were a single man and woman, it was inconvenient to rent a house. She recognized me as her adoptive grandfather and asked for help, etc. The court verified the statements and ordered the plaintiff to appear in court for interrogation and announced a new date for the hearing.</p>
<h3>Silk Merchant Zhang Shengliang Obstructs a Family, Cohabits with a Female Student; The Woman's Mother Reports the Arrest</h3>
<p>Zhu Yu, a woman from Pudong, originally lived in her hometown. After the outbreak of the war, she brought her seventeen-year-old daughter Zhu Jingwen to Shanghai to seek refuge two years ago, residing at No. 13 Zhengyuan Lane, Bei Di'ao Road in the French Concession. To become self-sufficient, Zhu Jingwen enrolled in the Dade Obstetrics Hospital at the intersection of Gordon Road and Xinzha Road,</p>
<p>Studying obstetrics, initially leaving early and returning late, and then living in the hospital. In August of the year before last, Zhang Shengliang, a silk merchant from Jinhua, Zhejiang, who worked for an English company, aged thirty-one, met Zhu by chance at the intersection of Gordon Road and Weihaiwei Road on Mulming Road. He began to pursue her, following her every day and teasing her. Over time, feelings grew, and one day they rented a house at No. 34 Yilixi Lane, Gordon Road, and began cohabiting. It has been over a year now. Recently, the woman's mother, Zhu Yu, discovered this secret.</p>
<p>She reported it to the Jing'an Temple Police Station the day before yesterday. Detective Zhang Xuejian was dispatched to arrest Zhang Shengliang and brought him and Zhu Jingwen to the police station. Zhang was detained, and the woman was taken back by her mother. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Second Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. Lawyer Zhang Tianyin, representing the police station, prosecuted him under Article 240, Section 3 of the Criminal Law and presented the case. According to Zhu Jingwen's complaint, she was seduced and cohabited with Zhang and repeatedly urged him to hold a wedding, but he always avoided it. Zhu Yu then filed</p>
<p>A civil suit, requesting compensation of 10,000 yuan for emotional distress. When questioned, Zhang Shengliang admitted to cohabiting with Zhu, but said that her mother, Zhu Yu, agreed to this, and the woman's sister wrote a cohabitation agreement, which Zhu Yu signed. The agreement is currently kept in a bank safe deposit box and will be submitted at a later date. This incident occurred because his brother and sister-in-law failed to get a loan, etc. After hearing the statements, the judge ordered Zhang to be detained and adjourned the case for seven days for further investigation.</p>

<h3>Yanjing University in Peiping Decides to Establish a Middle School in Hong Kong: Site Found, School May Open in the Autumn</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong Correspondence) Yanjing University in Peiping has decided to establish a middle school in Hong Kong. Xu Dishan, Ma Jiming, Xu Wanjun, Chuan Shishi, Ye Xiuying and other alumni of Yanjing University in Hong Kong are actively preparing for it. According to Mr. Ma Jiming, the plan to establish a secondary school in Hong Kong by Yanjing University was originally based on the opinions provided by the president of the university after he visited Hong Kong and the interior a month ago. It is currently under preparation. The Hong Kong side is currently planning to find a school site in the New Territories, but so far there is no suitable location. If the school site is found before the summer vacation, it may be possible to open the school in the fall. In terms of funding, it is planned to raise HK$10,000 from alumni of the school and philanthropists in Hong Kong for start-up expenses. Currently, it is only planned to run the first year of junior high school and senior high school. If possible, the second and third years of senior high school will be continued. In terms of curriculum, it is proposed to focus on teaching students light industrial skills so that after graduation, when they are no longer pursuing further studies, they will be able to take on the roles of middle-level cadres between industrial engineers and workers. The tuition fee will be as low as possible in order to benefit students with lower economic capacity, so that they also have the opportunity to enroll. It is also learned that Yanjing University has been recruiting new students in Hong Kong every year. This year, due to some special circumstances, it has been decided to stop recruiting new students, but Shanghai will continue to hold recruitment as usual.</p>

<h3>Cotton Yarn: The July Double Horse Yarn Contract Opened Yesterday, Boosting Bullish Sentiment</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market has turned calm and is showing signs of price increases. This is due to the rebound in overseas cotton markets, coupled with a decrease in the U.S. dollar exchange rate, which has stabilized sentiment. Short sellers have been actively covering their positions. Simultaneously, there is consistent demand for coarse yarn from Hong Kong, providing support for market traders. The July Double Horse yarn contract price has been released at 1,230 yuan, which has reassured bullish traders who can now hedge for the next month. However, eager buyers are not yet evident, resulting in limited transactions.</p>
<p>In morning trading, news of a decrease in foreign exchange rates and a simultaneous rise in Indian and American cotton prices have invigorated the previously sluggish sentiment. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn initially rose to 1,150 yuan, then to 1,190 yuan. Subsequently, profit-takers emerged, causing the price to fall back to 1,160 yuan. By the close of trading, the market was boosted again by rising gold prices and positive sentiment, pushing the price up by more than ten yuan. Statistics show that 1,615 lots were traded during the half-day session. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn rose by 43 yuan. Today, 35 bales of cotton yarn were shipped out, with 690 bales going to Hong Kong. The distribution of purchases by various trading groups is listed below:</p>
<p>Domestic traders: 1,275 bales; Xiamen: 5 bales</p>
<p>Hong Kong: 355 bales; Ningbo: 20 bales; Total: 1,615 bales</p>
<p>400 Bales of Indian Cotton Traded</p>
<p>Transactions of domestic cotton have ceased, but Indian cotton trading is relatively active. Japanese factories have made a substantial purchase, and trading among domestic traders has also shown slight activity. This is because overseas Indian cotton markets are rising across the board, improving market conditions. However, business has not yet fully taken off. The current cotton transaction details are listed below:</p>
<p>Amra: 198.00 yuan; Donghua Trading: 100 bales</p>
<p>Dholera: 217.00 yuan; Tongbang Trading: 100 bales</p>
<p>Surat: 215.00 yuan; Qingsheng Trading: 100 bales</p>
<p>Broach: 203.00 yuan; Domestic Trader: 100 bales</p>
<p>In other news regarding foreign cotton market prices, the New York cotton market has shown remarkable strength recently. At the start of the day, speculative buying and short covering activity drove prices up. As a result, closing prices were more than ten points higher than the previous day. Indian cotton prices also rose significantly due to improved sentiment and buying from European exporters. Overall forecasts indicate an increase of eight rupees.</p>
<p>The Shanghai foreign cotton market has recently benefited from the rising overseas cotton prices and a gradual tightening of exchange rates, resulting in positive sentiment. Spot transactions are limited, but there are still sporadic deals. Overall, market participants believe that market conditions are improving and that cotton prices will likely rise without falling.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Inland Cloth Sales Gradually Increasing</h3>
<p>The cloth market is stable due to the firmness of raw material yarn and cotton. With the successive arrival of local produce such as tea and silk from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces, demand for cotton cloth is gradually increasing. As a result, the downward trend in cloth prices has slowed down. Yesterday, the general cloth market was stable, with retail prices still one to one and a half jiao cheaper per piece. Wholesale shops in this street purchased over 200 pieces of coarse cloth, poplin, foreign yarn, and bleached cloth. Traders from the Wenzhou and Ningbo areas of eastern Zhejiang bought foreign yarn. Cantonese traders purchased fifty to sixty boxes of colored cloth and colored twill. Nearly 2,000 bolts of bleached cloth, colored cloth, and bleached twill were purchased for export to Singapore and other countries.</p>
<p>The Eastern Cloth Market is showing increasing strength. This morning, White Dragon Fine Cloth opened at 35.50 yuan per piece. Subsequently, due to a drop in gold prices, it fell to 35.05 yuan by noon. In the afternoon, as market sentiment favored bullish positions, some traders believed that the downward trend was slowing. Consequently, there was less selling, and White Dragon Fine Cloth closed at 35.25 yuan. "Four Gentlemen" cloth was priced at 9.125 fen per yard.</p>
<p>Piece goods exports on the 16th included 219 pieces to Hong Kong, 152 pieces to Singapore, 20 pieces to Sluis, and 40 pieces to . Shipments on the 18th included 45 pieces to Xiamen, 300 pieces to Weihaiwei, 95 pieces to Yantai, and 30 pieces to Tianjin.</p>

Additionally, 229 bags of sugar arrived from Hong Kong yesterday.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Inland Silk Merchants Cannot Come to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Since last year, Shanghai silk mills have been subject to controlled raw material prices. This spring, many mills have shifted their investments inland to set up small silk factories. However, unfortunately, most of these small silk factories are located in occupied areas and are thus still controlled by the "administration." It is recently learned that the puppet regime, under the guise of "construction" donations, will levy a 12% tax on raw silk transported to Shanghai. Considering that each bale of factory silk is valued at 1,000 yuan, each bale will have to pay 300 yuan. Therefore, inland silk merchants can no longer come to Shanghai.</p>
<p>The local silk market has suspended cargo transactions. Chinese silk merchants have now deeply realized the importance of the relationship between the nation and commerce.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Hengyun spot was priced at 1,550 yuan, near-term at 1,560 yuan, and far-term at 1,586 yuan. With New York closed for the week, the local silk exchange was quiet.</p>
<h3>Green Tea Declining Gradually</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign tea market saw each merchant house and trading firm considering the increasingly severe European war, which made business more brisk. The entire market, including firms such as Xiehe and Tongshou, imported over 180 boxes of new and old Chun Mei green tea. New goods were priced from 265 to 280 yuan, while old goods were priced at 135 yuan, a drop of 20 to 30 yuan compared to previous prices. The market for high-end Chun Mei tea remained sluggish.</p>
<p>Additionally, 526 bales of tea were shipped to Singapore and 15 bales to Western Asia the day before yesterday (16th). Yesterday, 500 bales of tea arrived from Hong Kong and 574 bales from Wenzhou. Today, 145 bales are being shipped to Xiamen and 500 bales to Tianjin.</p>
<h3>Metals: Deformed Steel Bars Decline</h3>
<p>The trade in deformed steel bars has become extremely sluggish, with prices falling continuously, after the sharp decline in the orders of traders from other ports, coupled with a small amount of business being handled by the building agencies in the street. The market sentiment is unstable. The spot price had already fallen from 1,430 yuan to the 1,400 yuan level. The prices for specifications from five-tenths to one inch also dropped from 1,380 yuan to the 1,350 yuan level.</p>

<h3>Waking Up the Prostitute, Huang Ying'er (3)</h3>
<p>Passing is difficult, the "Bai Xiang" people [those who frequent prostitutes] need to pass the checkpoints. The family delivers gifts, carrying them on poles through the streets, a basket of snacks, a basket of fruit, plus ham and preserved eggs. During that time, a pile of debt urges you to pay it back soon. Or you meet someone you like, and you love her youth, and you believe everything she says. You are infatuated, and she is affectionate, and you wholeheartedly want to settle down for life. Without taking a formal title, the money is used up, and everything comes to nothing. It can be considered affectionate, marrying her home properly, but she has always been loose and restless. She doesn't get along with family, doesn't agree with neighbors, and her extravagance and indulgence are even worse than before. It doesn't work out, the family fortune is emptied, and she is still divorced and disgraced. Wandering is never suitable. When you meet a lover, money is like mud. Even if you use up a thousand gold, it's hard to get your wish. She doesn't know good from bad, doesn't distinguish high from low, and calls a rich man her confidant. Like a fox, she is willing to deceive, even immortals and Buddhas are confused. There are also those who turn back, saying they will quit from tomorrow, making endless vows in front of people. But as soon as they see their friends, they can't control themselves and rush back to the old path. It's hard to give up; the endless entanglements are a fishhook in life. Extreme joy turns to sorrow; in the end, you are not free. The prostitute casually betrays your good intentions. At first, it's romantic, but gradually it becomes depraved. Proper relatives and friends are alienated. Without other plans, what else can you do but steal? As the days go by, money becomes scarce, and regretting the past is in vain. It's hard to face the elders at home. Today on the roadside, tomorrow on the street, their inherent character is base and cheap. Who will pity them? How can they survive the cold and hunger?</p>

<p>Thoughts</p>
<h3>Starting with "Being Detached"</h3>
<p>— Yan Yisong</p>
<p>I happened to flip through "Three Hundred Tang Poems" and read three poems from Li Bai's "Hard Roads." Below the last two lines of the final poem, "Enjoy a cup of wine before I die, why bother with a thousand years of fame after death?" the commentator notes, "See how detached the final two lines are."</p>
<p>The common Chinese mentality is either to like being detached or to like groaning. Groaning doesn't necessarily mean one is sick; often, even without being sick, people groan in sorrow and misery. Writers are among the best at this. Therefore, most articles, poems, or lyrics are either "Don't let the golden goblet face the moon empty" or have a horizontal line of "How sad" and a vertical line of "Alas." Because without these, the work seems bland and tasteless. Although there are exceptions, they are only a very few.</p>
<p>This trend has continued to this day. Some people have risen up to resist it, but without much effect. So, for a while, "immersion" style novels were particularly popular, and works about romance, pleasure, and drinking were also well-received. But the unlucky ones were not the authors of these works, but the readers who were deeply influenced by them, especially young people!</p>
<p>We know very well that everyone feels sadness and pain at times, but we believe that merely lamenting and crying out is completely useless. We also know that everyone should be detached, but we believe that a kind of passive detachment is unacceptable. Passive detachment is another way of expressing sadness and pain, but instead of "Ai ya" and "Ai ya" groaning, it uses pleasure, romance, and drinking to seek temporary numbing and forget all the pain, if there is really any pain.</p>
<p>This kind of passive detachment causes losses that are greater and more tragic than merely groaning and crying.</p>
<p>Sadly, in China, this kind of detachment is extremely popular. Taking Shanghai as an example, restaurants and bars are packed with people, and dance halls and game halls are overflowing.</p>
<p>However, the generally idle writers don't seem to care, and they are spreading their poison as much as possible, fearing they are not doing enough.</p>
<p>Friends, don't be fooled anymore. I sincerely advise you, they are groaning without being sick to express pain, don't follow them to be in pain. They are luring you into the trap of pleasure and drinking to get a little detached, you must never go! If you really encounter something sad and painful, don't just shout or seek numbness, you must find a way to overcome it. A person doesn't necessarily need a thousand years of fame after death, but it's enough to live with some meaning. Although the road is hard, you have to walk it, and you won't fail to reach your destination.</p>
<p>This can also be called detachment, but in another way, actively, not passively.</p>
<h3>The Stubbornness of Life</h3>
<p>— Lei Xing</p>
<p>After reading a biography written by a tramp, I gained many thoughts and lessons. My fantasies roamed on the roofs of American trains and in the forests; I also seemed to see a man with a prosthetic leg begging and selling lace in European villages and towns.</p>
<p>Can you imagine? A tramp spent years and months of his life in the Americas and Europe, and broke a leg; but in the end, he became a poet - a poet praised by George Bernard Shaw and other great critics. Who gave him courage and perseverance? What spurred a cripple to devote himself to writing verses? The God in the mouth of the pastor, the lover in the mouth of the knight? Neither. I say it is a stubbornness of life.</p>
<p>Stubbornness has been criticized, because our society needs "great men" who can be both rounded and squared. However, the reason why mankind has not been destroyed and the nation has not perished is precisely because of the stubbornness of our ancestors.</p>
<p>In ancient times, mankind fought against cruel nature; today, it is different - I mean the objects are different, the struggle never changes. In great suffering and pain, we strive for survival and sunny days, and we shout out a cry that resounds through the clouds: We want to live.</p>
<p>What runs through a colorful life is the stubborn will to live. Remember that this is not just clinging to life; to live under coercion and wealth is the base act of cowards and weaklings. On the contrary, the stubbornness of life is battle and struggle, and it is endless.</p>
<p>Living is always lovely, but the meaning of living is not just about sustaining life; we all have to eat, because we are not gods but people, but more importantly, we have to "be human -" because we are threatened with being unable to be human. The power that supports resistance to the situation of being treated like cattle and horses is precisely the stubbornness of life.</p>

<h3>The City of the Red Cross</h3>
<p>— Ling Shuang</p>
<p>Only a few miles from the Maginot Line, in a military area full of fortifications, is a French town called Phalsbourg, the most non-military town in the world. There are no machine guns, rifles, or pistols in the town; no anti-aircraft guns to protect small bridges; and no markings or sandbags for air-raid shelters. At night, the lights in the town reflect in the sky, brighter than usual. The tools of war are rumbling all day long—tanks, ammunition boxes, soldiers, horses, trucks. But the unarmed sentries in the town order them to go elsewhere. If active soldiers want to enter this town, they can only be carried in on a stretcher.</p>
<p>Because Phalsbourg is the capital of the Red Cross; General Schikele of France proposed to establish a Red Cross zone to spare the wounded the horror of being bombed, and this town is the first major humanitarian experiment. At the International Red Cross Conference in 1932, General Schikele proposed that in future wars, small towns with no military value should be handed over to the Red Cross for use, with the combatant countries guaranteeing absolute safety. Germany, France, England, and several other countries expressed their support; the agreement to be passed in 1939 was not signed, but France established the City of the Red Cross according to the set plan.</p>
<p>The roofs of the town's hospitals are all painted with obvious markings; the town's square is also painted with a large red cross. The authorities have made extensive publicity about the nature and location of this town. The extent to which this experiment can succeed will depend on Germany's attitude towards this agreement. So far, everything is going very smoothly.</p>
<h3>Health Training</h3>
<p>— Competition</p>
<p>We must reduce the time spent eating and drinking and contemplate more.</p>
<p>When going out, instead of riding, it's better to walk leisurely.</p>
<p>Don't be too particular about clothing, the important thing is to wash and clean your body.</p>
<p>Don't worry unnecessarily, work more.</p>
<p>It's better to play than to waste time idly.</p>
<p>Speak less, pay more attention to thinking.</p>
<p>Waste less, produce more.</p>
<p>Don't get angry and scold people for no reason, always wear a smile.</p>
<p>Don't talk empty words, do more practical things.</p>
<p>Hawthorn Detective Case</p>
<h3>The Prima Donna's Fate</h3>
<p>— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter 1 "A very pretty lady!"</p>
<p>The iron box that Hawthorne spoke of was to the left of the recliner. The box was rectangular, painted in light blue, and in terms of style and color, it looked like a radio. In the corner by the window, there was a bookshelf. In fact, calling it a bookshelf would be an "accusation." Because there were no books on the shelf, except for a few picture magazines and newspapers like those on a desk, most of it was empty. Against the back wall, there was another three-dimensional dressing table, on which cups, saucers, wine bottles and the like, were all foreign goods. On the wall east of the dressing table hung an oil painting in a wide gold frame, three feet long and two feet high, also depicting foreign scenery. In short, the impression given to me by all the objects in the room was nothing but extreme "luxury" and "wastefulness," forgetting the era and the country!</p>
<p>Hawthorne took the key and walked to the iron box, carefully sliding open the round keyhole cover on the box door, inserting the key, which fit perfectly. He simply turned the key and opened the box door handle as well, casually pulling it open. Inside there were also three or four stacks of bundled legal tender. Before he could begin to examine the contents of the iron box, he suddenly heard a burst of coughing. He quickly closed the door of the iron box, turned around, and greeted the person who used the coughing sound as a prelude.</p>
<p>At this time, Ni Jinshou had led the deceased's uncle, Li Zhiban, in.</p>

<h3>Clark Gable</h3>
<p>— Film</p>
<p>He was very clever from a young age, and his acting experience came from school. Because during his school days, when the school held entertainment events, if there was a play to be performed, he would always take on an important role. After leaving school, he went through a lot of trials in society, joining a theater troupe and performing stage plays. Therefore, he was quite skilled when he appeared on the silver screen, and soon showed amazing acting skills, becoming a rising star.</p>
<p>Academy Award</p>
<p>Indeed, Clark Gable has become a generation of artist in Hollywood. Among male stars, his acting skills can be said to be among the best! Every film he stars in achieves considerable success. The general movie audience also has a considerable fondness for him. He won the Academy Award for Film Arts in 1934, and that year, he was ranked first among the three winning male stars. Since then, his status in the film industry has been rising day by day.</p>
<p>Instant Fame</p>
<p>It is indeed not easy for him to achieve today's status in the Hollywood film industry and be recognized as an outstanding talent by the general public. Because not many years ago, when he arrived in Hollywood, he did not even have the opportunity to be an extra for a while. But he did not lose heart, and continued to work hard, determined to break through this film front. As a result, where there is a will, there is a way. He broke through, and unexpectedly, he rose to fame as soon as he appeared on the screen, becoming so popular so quickly, which is unmatched by ordinary male stars.</p>
<p>Affectionate Couple</p>
<p>Since he has such success on the screen, according to convention, many actresses in Hollywood pursue him. As a result, Carole Lombard was the winner. In the winter before last, the two were very much in love, and romances were often reported. Lovers become family, and in the spring of 1939, the film city spread the news of Clark Gable and Carole Lombard's marriage to every corner of the world, making fans feel that this film couple was perfect. From then on, they formed a happy family, and many guests often visited their home. Last Christmas, Carole Lombard even personally cooked to entertain guests.</p>
<p>Reaching New Heights</p>
<p>This time, Clark Gable was cast as the male lead in "Gone with the Wind." Due to his past experience and innate artistic talent, playing such a role was naturally a good fit. In addition, the female lead was played by newcomer Vivien Leigh, which would naturally complement each other. Therefore, when "Gone with the Wind" was completed and then publicly released in the United States, Clark Gable received good reviews from fans again. Facts tell us that Gable is a very good actor.</p>
<h3>Shu Nie Leaves Shanghai</h3>
<p>The day before yesterday afternoon, a cultural worker quietly left Shanghai for the mainland. He is Mao Shuyin, who used to write film reviews for the Chen Bao, and Shi Wen, who once made a guest appearance in "Ge Nen Niang" and other plays with the China Travel Troupe.</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the war, he was sent north to comfort the National Army, and visited Wuhan, Henan, Shanxi, northern Shaanxi and other places. Later, he served as the secretary of the General Headquarters of the Fourth War Zone and was in charge of political training work.</p>
<p>This time he quietly left Shanghai, also to do some wartime cultural work, fulfilling the mission that a cultural person should have. Before leaving Shanghai, he completed two plays, namely, he adapted "Dong Xiaowan" and "Jingzhong Warring States" into two spoken drama scripts. Now these scripts have been handed over to Tang Huaiqiu of the "China Travel Troupe" for performance at the Xuan Palace in the near future.</p>
<h3>The Jindu Grand Theater Will Start Construction at the End of the Month</h3>
<p>— Little Xu</p>
<p>—Grand Opening on New Year's Day</p>
<p>The "Jindu Grand Theater" (English name: Golden Castle Theatre), jointly funded by film tycoons the Liu brothers, Zhang Shanxian, Zhang Shichuan, etc., has decided to start construction at the end of this month. This future new-style cinema is located at the intersection of Avenue Foch and Route Doumer, a superior and convenient location. The vacant lot is now surrounded by bamboo fences, and the atmosphere of construction is already visible. It is estimated that it will be completed within half a year and will open on New Year's Day. The architectural design of the theater was entrusted to Yang Xiliu and Huang Yuanji of the Kaitai Architectural Firm. The style is streamlined. In terms of equipment, the cold and hot air machines are the latest models, and the sound, lighting, and seats are all first-class products. There are more than 1,500 seats in total, 500 upstairs and 1,000 downstairs. The main entrance is located in the middle of the street corner. The films to be shown in the future will mostly be the first-run productions of Guohua and Xinhua.</p>
<h3>A Report on the Experimental Concert</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yongkang</p>
<p>On the evening of the 14th, the YMCA held an "experimental concert". The program included ensemble, solo, chorus and solo singing.</p>
<p>Most of the ensembles were performed by the "Mei Ye Quintet", with the "Heaven and Hell Overture" being the best, and the "Lullaby" also being very beautiful.</p>
<p>The solo instrument was the violin, played by Mei Ye, a Russian of Chinese descent, with Chen Gexin accompanying on the piano, playing "Gypsy Airs". This is a very difficult piece of music. Except for some unclear passages in the slow tempo, it was played very well. The final rapid section was played quite briskly and powerfully.</p>
<p>The chorus was conducted by Chen Gexin, with a total of six songs. "Forward" was originally the tune of the Volga Boatmen's Song, but now the words have been changed, but it does not lose the original sense of grief. The lightness of "Boating Music" is a contrast to "Forward". "Golden Floating Clouds", "Fatherland March" and "Song of Transbaikalia" are works of old or new Russia. The conductor has special touches in handling these Russian tunes, as if he were Russian: that is to say, he understands the rich expression that is unique to Russian music. "Chain Iron" was sung very well, but no one could hear the words.</p>
<p>Xu He and Hu Quanxiang have very good sound quality, but they are a bit "stage-frightened", and seem afraid to sing. Zheng Shouyan did not sing, and the audience was quite disappointed.</p>
<p>It is said that most of the members of "Shi Yin" are professional youths, who have not specialized in music. If this is true, it should be considered very successful.</p>
<h3>Another Double Case — Guohua and Lianmei Simultaneously Filming Liang Hongyu</h3>
<p>The Lianmei Company, which caused a heated competition among private film companies because of "Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai", had already purchased the two scripts of "Liang Hongyu" and "Gorgeous Fate" for its second work, which has been planned for many days, and will choose one to film. However, at the film association meeting, Liu Zhonghao, the owner of Guohua, indicated that "Liang Hongyu" was about to start filming, and "Hua Li Yuan" was also already finalized, and neither could be conceded. The Lianmei representative was willing to avoid conflict and asked Guohua to each get one script, and also asked Guohua to join the investment in the works filmed by Lianmei. Mr. Liu did not agree, and they broke up unhappily, which is likely to cause another double case after "The Three Smiles".</p>
