<h3>德義的次一閃電戰</h3>
<p>英國三島人士夙以英倫海峽爲天賦屛障，以冬季的風雪雨霧爲天賦掩護，更復人心奮發，士氣激揚：舉所謂天時地利人和的優越條件，而今湊合了。這在紙上談兵之儔，早就說過；如果希特勒在本年冬季之前，對英作戰得不到決定的勝利，則縱使運籌帷幄，別有侵英妙算。亦須保留到明年春暖之後，纔得實施。此種議論，當然有其見地；在存亡續絕之交，逢臨深履薄之候，負有邦國萬鈞重任的人們，怎敢依恃這類觀察而疎懈：然而也有一部分人，乃至國會議員，因此而想徧徵各交戰國的同意，在聖誕節左右，相的暫時休戰，讓作戰人員可以「和平的」優遊渡此佳節。這一擬議雖經英國政府打銷，但英國一般心理的緊張似隨秋風而俱逝，則小可掩諱。加之，納粹作戰機構，自從擊碎了法國的抵抗以後，除了空軍，已經好久沒有表演；這足以使大衆對於牠的攻擊及破壞力量、漸漸消釋了長懼的印象，漸漸引起了鬆弛的錯覺。不但如此，義大利軍事在希臘碰了壁，巴爾幹形勢因保加利亞的强項而受了　，亦足以使大衆以爲德義對近東攻勢的計謀不售，自此一籌莫展了。這些見地，自有所本；然而試問冬季的英國是吾已告安全？納粹戰鬥機構是吾已成弩末？巴爾幹形勢是否已使德義却步？則不但沒有人大胆的肯定，　且對於這些情形，正應視為包含着納粹施行其「閃電戰術」的最好條件。舍其他一切條件而不談，要知抓住了敵人懈怠和不注意的時機，突發其閃電般的動作，令敵人措手不及，使敵人束手就縛，這正是所謂閃電戰術的精義！往事歷歷，血淚斑斑，覆轍不遠，應予儆戒啊！</p>
<p>從德義方面說：德國這决作戰致勝的要訣，要在速戰速決。希特拉確已一舉而擊潰素以陸軍國著名的法國了，這是速戰速決之效；幸而速決，不然，膠着了三兩年以上。英法海外殖民地力暈匯集之後，德國能吾獲勝，就成了莫大疑問。這一原則，現在用以對付英國，雖已打了很大的折扣；然而留待一年半年之後，必然的尤不如現在。即以現在而論：英國在海上的封鎖工作，一天緊似一天了；自義希戰起後，太蘭多港一戰，義國海軍驟然被殲及半；而希臘各港被英海軍爭制機先，尤加强了英國對地中海的控制；僅此種種，可以想見英國所行海上封鎖的嚴重性爲如何。所以現在擺在德義面前的緊急課題，就是不管向那一方向，亟須殺出一條出路，絕不能坐候僅有的資源，由大量消耗而枯竭，終至於一敗不可收拾。於此可見德國始終具有採用閃電戰術的理由與其必要。</p>
<p>這幾個月來，德國沒有大規模向外侵襲的最大原因之一，是在對於已經征服了的各國，從事於整理和開發；到目前為止，這個工作大概已經有其相當的成就；秋熟過了，各國農產品及牲畜家禽等，正是收藏積聚的季節，而形成德國的戰糧；所有的工廠，由時間賜予，當亦變成納粹生產機構的一部；又經此相當的軍事佔領的時期，對被征服者的懷柔政策，以及鎭壓與肅淸的工作，亦必已減少其後顧之憂。由此種種，當然又造就了納粹繼續向外侵襲擴展的本能與馮藉。險了這些而外，義國對希臘作戰的棘手，當然更是德義兩國所必須亟求解決的緊急課題。蓋不但德義對巴爾幹的欲念爲所逆襲，且因英國大量援助希臘，及蘇土兩國遙作聲援的情形下，使德義在巴爾幹及在巴爾幹以外的威望，開始了動搖；使所謂「新秩序」也者，突受了悽慘酷烈的當頭一棒。德義要想衝過這個難關、則以全力擊潰希臘、然後進規巴爾幹，自是要圖；不若此以閃電戰略，向英倫突擊制勝，尤其上策。</p>
<p>總上所述，析論德義未來「閃電戰」的可能方向。大概不外三途：第一是突襲英倫三島。最近英國「新聞紀事報」，曾經鄭重指出德國有系統轟炸英國各大工業中心的値得注意，而認為或許是希特勒企圖在英國登岸的前奏曲；此舉的難關，在於無法打破英吉利海峽中英國艦隊威力，故登岸固然困難，登岸後的後勁及接濟尤難。第二是突然向巴爾幹推進。此舉或不免再冒大不韙、須從陸路上對南斯拉夫·或對保加利亞，一舉而佔領之，然後攻下希臘而囊括巴爾幹。第三是由西班牙奪取直布羅陀海峽，一舉而突入非洲。此舉的主要問題是西班牙的態度：蓋將由德義假這西班牙而直接自己動手呢還是假手於西班牙而德義為之後盾呢？三途之中，害得失　眞是一言難盡，但不能否定其各有採行的可能！</p>

<p>歐戰叢談　廿五</p>
<h3>希特勒的苦悶</h3>
<p>諾蓋斯已有吉勞特先入之言，對此兩位英國特使，拒不延見，也不令他們和馬錫利亞號船上的要人們晤談。兩人自到達加薩勃朗加時起，卽被監視。决日飛回倫敦，他們的使命已是失敗了。</p>
<p>他們所負使命的重要，固非法國人所得而知，他們的失敗可眞悲慘！英國情報部曾截獲德國的密電，內有德法停戰條件，曾規定駐泊奥蘭港的法國軍艦，須移交德國。他們此行，卽爲探詢此電虛實而來。</p>
<p>英國人後來才知道，那個密電乃是有德人故弄狡獪。假使諾蓋斯將軍肯接見戈特和特夫古柏兩人，這一詭計必能早日褐破。惜乎他們在加薩勃朗加飽嘗閉門之羹，更使他們相信這密電的千眞萬確了。</p>
<p>因此誤解，英艦隊遂於七月三日，駛到奥蘭港，向法艦隊提出哀的美敦書，限令在六小時內答覆。法艦隊因不欲違反貝當政府的命令，拒絕接受條件。於是英艦開砲攻擊，法艦沉沒和負創的各有數艘，士兵陣亡者以數百計。</p>
<p>就這事經過看來，法艦隊全無防禦準備，亦未有離開奥蘭的意向。事後據法國海軍士官說明，他們早已受命將各艦留駐港中，且已開始拆除砲位和引擎了。</p>
<p>那時候法國艦隊的熱烈親英，可以毋庸懷疑。假使貝當政府下令將艦隊移交德國或義國，必將引起叛變。英國倘能稍待一二星期，就可明瞭真相了。</p>
<p>奥蘭港法艦的沉沒，一般人都盛稱爲英國的大勝利。然在德國人也儘可自詡爲德國的又一勝利。許多法國人所抱繼續抗德的一片希望，已隨着法艦而同沉海底了。諾蓋斯將軍因此毫不遲疑，將芒台爾重行逮捕，飭令馬錫利亞號立卽駛往馬賽，除了達拉第一人而外，其餘都不准逗留。</p>
<p>諾蓋斯對于達拉第，素所欽敬，不願把他遣回法國，驅之死地。因此允許那位前任總理「隱居宇下」至數星期之久。在此「隱居」期內，達拉第的友好也曾竭力設法，使他逃往美國或南美洲。</p>
<p>但是達拉第不願以亡命者自居。他的離開法國，非爲保全個人生命，乃欲保全國家生命。那時法蘭西民族委員會已在軍事專家特戈爾將軍領導之下，在倫敦成立，他覺得除往倫敦而外，別無其他救國途徑。特戈爾的才能雖爲人所敬重，但他不論在國內，或在海外　法國人作廣泛的呼籲。，都是沒沒無聞，不足以資號　可是達拉第的大名却是婦召。他的大名，法國人知道的很少，因此不能由他出面，向孺皆知。法國農商各界，對于一班官僚政客，雖深嫉痛惡，獨對于達拉第却是衆望所歸。他被稱爲「中庸的法國人」，具有法國人所特有的一切美德和過失。達拉第自信一旦起而領導法蘭西民族委員會，必能使主戰派陣營爲之一新，非特戈爾所能望其項背。</p>
<p>諾蓋斯雖很願意使達拉第遠颺他方，但不肯聽任他前往倫敦。一决有葡萄牙水上飛機一架，在加薩勃朗加降落，準備載達拉第他去，但因諾蓋斯的一道命令，達拉第遂未能成行。</p>
<p>其决有一希腦運貨船，允載達拉第起行，但在最後的一刹那，達拉第忽然覺此事未免過於危險，遽爾變卦。達拉第的友人業已智窮力竭，無計可施，不得已乃上書英國駐西班牙大使　爾爵士和直布羅陀總督，要求派英國巡洋艦一艘往迎。但是望眼欲穿，而巡洋艦的影蹤俱無。</p>
<p>達拉第的友人就對他說：「你不能跑到英國去了。你現在祗好到美國，這是碩果僅存的機會了。」但是達拉第仍堅持如前，除了英國以外，便不肯他去。諾蓋斯最後耐無可耐，在他到後　個月，便把他實施逮捕。</p>
<p>達拉第輩雖然功敗垂成，但不能謂法國的內紅已經平息。德國對英戰局未定，力圖把强烈反德親英的個人或團體，一網打盡。他們又用盡各種宜傳方法，拉攏法國人，以贊助穗國式「歐洲新秩序」。</p>
<p>德國在今夏擊潰法軍之後，即以全力注重這種工作，麻兩個月之久，實亦無怪其然。他們還須在荷比和其他被佔領各國，採取同樣手段，不過規模較小，形式略異而巳。巴爾幹各國，更須德國費盡心力，不斷注意。而那一頭蘇俄「白熊」也不能不顧。德國人對于龐大帝國的建立和統治，已初次嘗到個中苦况了。</p>
<p>及到八月十一日，德國向英倫三島實施空軍閃電戰。但據我們處于德軍戰綫後方者的觀察，這時候的英倫空戰，仍不過是不戰中的一環，德軍的主要戰塲依然是在歐洲大陸。</p>
<p>包圍在德軍戰綫之內，心懷怨望的非德國人，的有一萬萬人之衆，國社黨領袖雖知道各佔領國的民衆，暫時必能逆來順受，但這種不滿，猶如埋藏的炸藥，隨時隨地都有爆發的可能。要使他們繼續隱忍，便須嚴密監視，甚至以食物，工作或個人安全作誘餌。</p>
<p>德國所担負的原是一樁巨大而有危險的工作。他們慘淡經營之後，已以風馳電掣之勢，把一個龐大歐洲握在手中，可是德國要集中全力向英倫三島，作致命的打擊，仍嫌不足，這一層德國知道，英國人也知道。這就是德國對英迄未採取攻勢的原因了。（完）德空軍攻英將領　前敵司令凱塞林　空軍總司令戈林　希特勒　前敵司令斯貝爾　前敵司令米爾契</p>

<h3>糧食　一漲數元連漲數日　將見一元一升米　民食至此地步已是危急萬分　猶是坐視不救豈欲誤盡蒼生</h3>
<p>米市在投機狂熱中、　鬧越兇、業外內新囤戶之入價爭買、貨主之扳價抬高、竟似瘋狂模樣、再不顧及正理之　斥而一般之勸吿矣、昨洋米晨漲晚大、又加三四五元、晨間開市後、謠風日厲、買氣益狂、高次各檔一致飛升、西貢一號漲達八十四元、二號八十元〇七角、比之前日已漲二三元、午後暗盤愈抬愈高、一號八十五六元尚乏售出、而二號寳塔牌竟至八十三元、則較大四五元矣、英華司因定貨未有正式公布、據說緬　米邇日確有多起定成均係直接交易、市上確少公布、以致貨囤更為居奇、統市祗有三百多噸點綴而已、一號十二月九十五元五角、二號十一月九十三元、十二月九十二元午後至九十三元、又現貨上午九十五元午後喊高未開、現貨交易被囤戶搶辦成交不下二萬包、計一號西貢八十四元、八十三元、二號八十元零七角、八十元、火絞八十二元四角、八十元、二號　維七十八元五角、七十七元半、小絞七十七元半、七十七元二角、東京砶尖七十二元二角、七十元、米　七十元、中六十九元、碎特六十九元五角、次至六十七元、蕪湖砶尖七十一元半、機尖七十五元半、</p>
<p>新粳及薄稻國米、自經虹口區運輸阻礙後、其來源已斷數日、更形奇貨可居、售價突飛猛進、又增三四元之巨、計開斛見新粳九十八元、薄稻原包九十八元、斛見九十五元至九十三元、</p>
<p>糯米去路稍懈、惟存底不充、市色又緊、開宜溧特元九十五元、普通九十二三元、香港白元八十五六元、中八十元、</p>
<p>洋米昨又到滬、太古公司慶元輪自香港運來三千七百四十五包、昨午抵埠、停靠浦東本行碼頭起卸、本市米價到此地步、粳米百元已在眼前、洋米雖逐日有到、而米價頻頻報漲、民食至此地步、固已危急萬分、而猶坐視不知挽救、豈欲誤盡蒼生耶、（祖）</p>
<h3>洋粉漲勢愈熾</h3>
<p>麵粉　日昨麵粉交易、仍以洋粉為主、查澳洲定粉自上月杪裝到十九萬餘包後、市塲已普遍洋粉勢力、華廠平價粉內、亦有一部份以洋粉為替代品、實屬空前之環境、所以食戶方面、莫不注意採辦洋粉、故昨日做開之花鳥鐘樓牌現洋粉、由十九元五角昂至十九元八角半、又本月初旬路貨十九元六角、比前日又升四五角、統市成交一萬二三千包、由本客各半辦去、至華粉批價仍為十八元、由兩廠批出八千餘包云、</p>
<p>小麥　昨日交易仍靜、而市面日趨暗挺、租界存棧貨喊價高達二十九元、華廠方面、尚嫌價昂、進胃不貪、日廠則仍以二十七元原價、門市略有收進、尚有零星解廠貨二三百包、均係預拋期貨、合價亦在二十七元左右云、</p>
<h3>雜糧　油豆操縱加厲</h3>
<p>本報上日所誌投機米蠶已向雜糧進製、昨日果然更見活躍、尤其油市掀得波浪蹈天、漲風漫瀰、業中空戶紛紛扒空反多、是以生豆油行情驟被抬高三四元之巨　豆市同在若輩縱橫下、帶起元許、統市成交大有廠豆油三百擔、烟歧豆油八十件、膠州豆油二百五十件、又生油七百件、烟台生油五十件、江北新生油一百聽、靑島生油六十桶、又近期又一千桶、又遠期交六百桶、靑島黃豆一千包、天津金元七百包、崇明沙黃四十包、浦東杜豆五十包、查這　銷交易寥寥無幾、</p>
<h3>糖市　刁靑久寂思動</h3>
<p>國糖為「搬出證」關係、不特久無開出、且來源亦乏、市勢至為淸寂、已有二閱月餘、無成交、查昨日建幫始有開出、高漳刁靑一批、計一百十包、價為六十三元半、比九月下旬僅降去三元許、尚屬平定、公會劃盤略有上落、現貨二四粗白本棧仍七十三元、荷赤現貨五十六元七八角、本月十日打棧單五十七元升二三角、太古車白B嘜七十六元一角、升三角、DY嘜東棧七十元二角、升二角、HX嘜西棧初做七十元二角、東棧七十元、後亦緊達七十元二角、</p>
<h3>南北貨　大片圓肉漲三元</h3>
<p>大片晒圓肉自降價後、行方曾還小十餘元、但號家所到之貨、因厦門反加特費、相持未開、而到數亦屬無多、故　持結果、趨勢見佳、聞近有開出數箱、比前反升三元云、</p>
<h3>金融　外滙利於賣方　氣氛愈益濃厚</h3>
<p>外滙昨日市况、匯豐掛牌、悉無上落、英美匯暗市、以美國竭力援華、利空氣氛濃厚、人心至此、遂轉鬆動、尤以港電等傾售甚夥、尚因華銀行具吃胃、致鬆勢尚緩、惟料前途當續放長、　現時環境、尚有刺激人心之流言、一部份經營者、徘徊中途、至本日收盤價、英金吿三辦士七六五六二五、美匯五元九三七五、比上日各長〇四六八七五與〇六二五、遠期與現貨微形拔開、</p>
<p>港方轉售美匯</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條近遠期均續降〇六二五、紐約銀價仍平、倫敦生金呆定、匯兌英對美不更、對滬縮〇六二五、美對英跌半分、對滬大五分、對法無市、中央掛牌各匯如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金三辦士七一八七五、美匯五元八一二五、與上日收市價同、開市後人心鬆動、日銀行首售與有利現美匯五元八七五、投機商暨港電亦吐塞美匯、潛勢更形硬化、計本月份由外銀行及美行吃入為五元八七五至九〇六二五、同時日行再賣現美匯若干、計美行所吸、均吿五元九〇六二五、匯豐掛牌揭曉勿動、白銀平衡稅又减低白分之〇·二五、此後因投機商止售轉扒、供求漸趨平衡、價亦一度盤旋、計本月份美匯外行出投機商五元八七五、華行亦給予投機商同月美匯五元八七五、午收平靜、現貨英金三辦士七五、美匯五元八七五、比晨開價硬〇三一二五與〇六二五、</p>
<p>市勢供過於求</p>
<p>後市市况不變、華行沽予投機商本月份美匯五元九〇六二五、嗣以利空消息傳來、而港雷等猛塞、雖華銀行吸胃奇厚、而供求終感不平、此後本月份美滙港　出外行華行等一致吿五元九三七五、晚收結果、現貨及本月份英金三辦士七六五六二五、美匯五元九二七五、下月份英金三辦士七五、美匯五元九〇六二五、比隔昨英長〇四六八七五、美鬆〇六二五、</p>
<p>香港美匯軋平</p>
<p>香港三日（週二）電、今晨匯市開盤吿平、英美滙價、均無變動、申匯現貨上升一元、為四百零一元、日匯現貨緊二元、為一百零一元半、十一時三十分吿平、美匯現貨鬆〇六二五、為二十三元半、申匯現貨降一元五角、為三百九十九元五角、下午二時三十分開盤吿平、美匯現貨又緊〇六二五、仍為二十三元四三七五、其餘不動、</p>
<p>天津英美均長</p>
<p>天津三日（週二）電、今晨匯市開盤吿平、倫敦電匯硬〇三一二五、為四辦士、紐約電匯長〇九三七五、為六元二八一二五、申匯降一元、為九十二元、「聯鈔」暗盤賤七角五分、為八十六元七角五分、</p>
<h3>貸款證實　金價真下</h3>
<p>昨日金市烚赤暗市、風浪平息、轉趨跌勢、價已退至五千八百元大關邊、聞中美新借款一萬萬六千萬元已正式簽字、外滙猛鬆、致將賣風掀動、各方人心轉平疲、自晨開卽低為五千八百六十元、金號賣勢下、續瀉四十元、美滙止鬆稍回、引起買方活動、小錢莊銀號銀進、遂升見五千八百八十元、近午利空消息傳來、午刻隨美滙轉疲、下午外滙更鬆、證劵幫滙票商銀號力售、遂退見五千八百零五元低價、終稍盤上、收市五千八百十三元、軋小六十二元、收後又退至五十八百元有賣戶、全日交易共四千五六百兩、掉期買方銀號貼出予錢莊數十兩、價為十二元、現金價比期交低十二元、飾金開金等均平、</p>
<p>烚赤瀉六十二元</p>
<p>晨初九點鐘開盤、　面尚靜、金號首售予銀號二十兩、五千八百六十元、比上日做低十五元、未幾聞滙市開出後微鬆、加之國內外政治消息利空、買進者殊缺、價乃續小、計金號售出較夥、而銀號對做三十兩、低為五千八百二十元、嗣因滙市止鬆、兼有利多空氣、引起散戶、小額搜購、銀號幫亦進、遂向上挺、銀號入證劵幫二十兩、為五千八百八十元、但證劵幫等又思出售、價雖維持、重趨下降、計金號沽予錢兌業二十兩、五千八百三十元、筱證劵幫人銀號三十兩、好起五元、五千八百三十五元、昨午收價、午後較疲、開盤銀號出錢兌　二十兩、祇五千八百二十元、不久回高十元、計金號進銀號二十兩、五千八百三十元、但聞外滙頗硬、銀號幫等猛吐、跌達五千八百元關邊、計銀號對做三十兩、五千八零五元、嗣以銀號等覆進有數、得又升起二三十元、計銀號入證劵幫三十兩、五千八百三十五元、結果銀號沽予證劵幫十兩、五千八百十三元、昨晚收價、比上日則狂落六十二元、全日上落有七十五元、現金號之本牌金、較烚赤高十餘元、收進低三十元、現標金照掛牌金低五六十元、均鮮做開、</p>
<p>飾金仍懸六百元　銀樓飾金、每兩兌出價、大同行新同行等仍掛六百元、收進低三十元云、</p>
<h3>劃頭滙劃　僅差一元</h3>
<p>昨匯劃票據貼現率、突再猛落、每千元貼進僅低至一元、貼出為　元、比上日小五角、錢業公會拆息早午均又掛小一分、為六分云、</p>
<h3>美票十七元進關</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市况、烚赤市價、突然回跌、英美金鎊因亦各降二元、英金金票供逾於求、市價軟弱、美金票漲後轉跌、始曾高至十七元一角三分、但旋卽步落、近午破入十七元關、卒為十六元八角、比上日終落二角八分、香港票趨勢仍軟、市價續疲一分、日金票及朝鮮票均趨挺漲、前者高至一元五角三分半、後者升為一元二角、</p>
<h3>證劵　外債漲風日盛　內債獨見盤旋</h3>
<p>證劵暗盤、昨日已漸入於盤旋之途、大借款成功後、並未見若何效力、實受環境惡勢力潛滋暗漲之影響、多空雙方咸有一種、懷疑不定之勢、塲內多空勢力、大都多頭勢力集中於丙種、其餘各種多方較弱、昨日乙種有數十萬賣出、市價頓小、但此數若施之於丙種、則無多大效力、前途仍係隨環境為變化、昨日聯和怡泰潤利、上下午始終賣出、以聯和賣出乙種為最湧、順昌始終買進、餘如鴻大永康聯益同康鼎康生大等均有買進、但為數不鉅、而二號四十一號及潤德仍有賣出、故市價疲莫能興、多空雙方尚在堅持陣綫、大體上勢均力敵、徐待變化也、一日結果、高低互見五分一角、惟乙種跌落四角為最鉅、成交約一百六七十萬、茲列簡明表於後、又今日起上午開盤時間提早一刻鐘、為九點半開始皆賣、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交商務印　館股五十股、價為八十四元正、</p>
<p>昨日衆業公所股市交易、賣方稍佔優勢、本埠局勢之欠定、滙票市塲之謠言、以及各領袖股趨勢之軟化、俱足為形成跌風之主因、祇此種跌風、並無嚴重性可言、橡皮股開軟收穩、亦猶市塲其他各部份然、</p>
<p>倫敦二日（週一）電、今日中國外債及遠東英商各公司股票掛牌行市、中國外債漲風頗烈、前檔之中法美金債劵（有印）漲起五鎊、價為四十鎊至四十五鎊、英法借款（英發）漲三鎊半、價為四十二鎊、善後借款（英發）漲二鎊半、價為三十鎊、克利斯浦漲二鎊、價為十九鎊、英德續借款（英發）漲一鎊半、價為三十七鎊半、費克斯飛機借款漲一鎊、價為九鎊、後檔鐵路債劵道淸漲一鎊半、價為十五鎊、隴海津浦原續發及廣九等各漲一鎊、隴海為十三鎊、津浦原續發均為十二鎊、廣九為十一鎊、英商股票、匯豐銀行英倫註冊股漲半鎊、價為六十九鎊、開平煤礦不記名股升九便士、價為十八先令三便士、其餘不動、</p>
<h3>上海毛絨紡織廠　新股明日發行</h3>
<p>上海毛絨廠此次增發新股七十八萬六千股、內除二十六萬二千股保留與舊股東及十萬股保留與發起人及董事職員等外、其餘四十二萬四千股將於明日上午十時至十時半在滙豐銀行公開認股、毛絨　股票之加入上海股票市塲者、當以此為嚆矢、</p>
<p>上海毛絨廠以所出純毛疋頭·粗細絨綫·馳譽遐邇、雙貓牌出品、現已有口皆碑、此種新興工業、在中國實業界中之地位、至屬重要、今日雖在艱難之時局中、尚能有如其槪况中所示之利益、足徵其事業本身之健全、與其全程之遠大、該廠生產及管理各方面、均以英國名廠為準、聞此次上海毛絨廠認股極為踴躍、可知此等穩固之工業投資、實為有識者所共趨也、</p>
<h3>紗花　棉紗獲利出籠　雙馬回小十二元</h3>
<p>上日大漲之紗市、昨則稍形回平、但趨勢依然安靜、此內漲風未免太暴、一般獲利者鑒於漲力已定、稍有吐出、因之回落一步、但實際上、仍無大跌面也、因廠方成本提高、而存底日趨减削、不過廠單籌碼遇劇漲、有人放空、比較為鬆懈、然一般擁資充足者、吸收轉棧之貨、始終不動生色、</p>
<p>雙馬晨開因上日午後、人氣緊張、多方心　仍昂、首盤價為一千二百五十五元、此價一開、有一部份獲利者稍稍出籠、一時籌碼稍　、而見回下至一千二百四十二元、旋外滙較鬆、浮多及搶帽之輩、又在空方活動、續挫至一千二百三十七元、然乘低時空頭又來抵補、仍回升至一千二百四十五元、卒以略平、收盤價為一千二百四十元、查半日間成交統計六千二百七十包、行情二十支雙馬跌十二元、茲將各幫口買出之額量、分列如左、</p>
<p>同行六、〇〇〇香港　二四五</p>
<p>天津　二五統計六、二七〇</p>
<h3>來源艱阻　棉商扳持如故</h3>
<p>現棉情况轉趨堅定、因來源不暢、華廠近因紗價高昂、心意較佳、時有購辦、所以價亦向上、同行扳價殊烈也、通州美種花價二百三十九元、巴西棉價為二百八十四元、火機花價為二百〇六元云、</p>
<p>外棉市價、紐約棉市堅定、且形活潑、同業之購買及一部份之空頭抵補、結果收盤價格、較之上日漲二磅音、印度停市、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、日來殊為靜寂、日方廠商昨日稍有購買　但乃小額交易、華方廠商購意則仍淡薄異常也、</p>
<h3>動盪中之紗市</h3>
<p>— 忠</p>
<p>最近兩旬中之紗市、可　變化無窮、考其趨勢、終在一千二百七十五元至一千二百元左右、數度週旋、始以中日和平空氣濃厚、外匯看長、賣方異常活躍、在十一月十八日、雙馬價為一千二百七十五元、逐步下降至二十三日曾見一千一百八十二元、價格旣落、而賣風稍戢、蓋一般擁資充斥之戶、在低峯時多額非但不搖動、反來拖進、於此籌碼乾枯、已顯着上升模樣、惟市塲議論紛紜、謂中美借款巨量的數額、當可成立、頭寸寬弛、市面要看小、至二十八日雙馬再見一千一百九十八元、豈料至十二月二日星期一開盤、因中美貸款宣佈、正式成就、人心虛怯、外滙頻頻放長、空頭興奮尤烈、紗市隨之而下、不料少頃外滙突然改縮、而現紗市塲風雲驟變、買者猶似蜂擁而來、空方大起驚慌、直綫奔騰、一跳四十元、雙馬高峯曾達一千二百五十八元、筆者在此番棉紗上升原因、探調如左、略作參考、</p>
<p>（一）近來雙馬空頭異常活躍、因美方有巨量貸款成功、而往往拋出之額、超出常軌、所以一遇反映抵抗不住、</p>
<p>（二）同業大戶吸收之額、始終不棄、揆其原由、為廠方成本有關、無願脫卸出、而原料不能鬆懈、且來源又艱鉅、</p>
<p>（三）　來謠風極熾、謂「某方銀行」將成立又說日紗禁止裝運江浙等省之數、業已完全開放、所以日紗漲辦更强、再四探問、完全開放、尚未到時、不過裝運之額、較昔可增加百分之幾、譬如說江蘇省每一個單位、每日裝銷五百包、現在可裝銷六百至七百包、多方又說檢最近之走勢向上盤也、</p>
<p>（四）西南方面需要雖無　批發展、但採辦四十二支及三十二支紗綫納胃殊健、比較目下二十支紗價較廉、所以望升者頗不乏人、根本問題、實銷多寡與否、紗市升沉為第一關鍵也、</p>
<h3>疋頭　溫台諸幫　活動辦布</h3>
<p>廠布昨市趨勢堅穩、乃因溫州航運有恢復常態之說、客幫存積各貨運出後、新交易漸增、細布·漂染布需要最繁、市面漸顯活動、售盤細布漲二角半至三角半、粗布斜紋漲一角至二角半、怡和漂布廠盤一律加五角至一元、春令細紗綫貨價亦激增、本街成交各貨一千餘件、粵港幫辦色布·漂布·粗細布等四百餘件、浙略溫台幫辦漂染布粗細布等二百餘件</p>
<p>東布龍頭細布售盤回挫、取市價每疋三十五元六角、而中檔細布則以本街實銷仍旺、堅持不動、四君子嗶嘰因散戶拋賣、亦隨龍頭下降、收盤價一元零九分左右、</p>
<h3>五金　盤元一日間　數易售價</h3>
<p>本釘　本釘前因走銷閉塞、一時曾見萎疲、但自近二三天來、因盤元行情日漲、故本釘成本增高、開價自亦須上漲、兼之內河客商以及本街生意均有動辦、昨計成交四五百桶之譜、實銷已易舊貌、人心自見良好、喊價帶高、昨每桶倍司沽五十五元、漲一元、</p>
<p>盤元　昨日盤元交易頻繁、不下千擔、故市氣挺秀、業中心思奇昂、一日間售盤數易、最後價沽六十元、較前亦升一二元不等、聞市貨頗不缺乏、故一時製釘廠螺絲廠鉛絲廠之原料、無斷檔之虞、</p>

<h3>滬西封鎖絕未鬆弛　領團向日方交涉　警務處與日憲兵部洽商　期望封鎖限制得以寬放</h3>
<p>據工部局情報處發表、關於滬西界外馬路區域被封鎖一事、已由警務處直接向日本憲兵司令部交涉、俾上項封鎖、得以寬放、工部局並已請求領袖領事設法交涉、以達寬放封鎖之目的、</p>
<p>領袖領事希爾稱、日總領堀內態度、對居民雖表友好及同情、但在下午二時之覆函中則稱、現在所施行之限制、爲搜捕行刺日憲兵之兇手而設、在日當局尚未認爲無法捕獲該兇手前、此項封鎖、尚不能解除、叉據協助辦理交涉之日籍警員稱、日方之答覆、謂封鎖一時尚不能解除、且有繼續維持至二三星期之可能、</p>
<p>各方努力　輸送食物</p>
<p>據英文大美晚報消息、日方封鎖滬西歹土區、至昨日（三）午後已入第四天、事態嚴重、駐滬外國領事與工部局警務處警官、乃會同日方、以謀寬弛日方所施之限制、而許食物運入、接濟自星期六日起卽被困該區不得出入之無數華籍居民、駐滬丹麥總領事兼領袖領事希爾、於昨日午後、與日總領事掘內會商、事前希爾已與他國領署代表會談、俾晤掘內時、說明全體外僑見解、</p>
<p>荷槍傷刺　巡邏如昔</p>
<p>查日方係商星期六日於日憲兵一名。刺後實施封鎖、以迄咋晨、封鎖區從靜安寺展　億　盤路、及從愚園路擴充至大西路、有日傭士兵荷槍上刺、往來巡邏、阻止華人出入、亦不許食物送交被困居民、盛傳西區各學校師生、將許出入、此說未獲證實、惟外僑皆準經過障礙物、</p>
<p>開槍之人　殆已離境</p>
<p>據封鎖區內某二僑居民稱、封鎖後諸多不便、如欲報紙食物皆須自行携入、華籍居民遭攔阻、無非索詐手段、蓋華人出一二元賄傭警、卽可進出、　開槍行刺日兵者、若有一二元、今亦早離封鎖區矣、</p>
<p>英美僑民　困難減少</p>
<p>同時聞美領署已採取直接步驟、以確保美僑之　益、前日有美領署某官員　日領署方面晤談、日方當告以美僑不致遭遇困難、父聞上海　話公司前日送交西區廬薩恩路分公司中西職員八十五人之食物與床舖、與雲飛汽車公司送交西區分站職員之日用品、皆係經美方官員交涉、始准人封鎖區、廬薩恩路電話分公司女職員、自星期六日起被困不斷工作、歷六十小時、僅得四小時睡眠、至昨晨始另有一批女職。接班遂各自返家安息、又英領署官員聲稱、封鎖區內英僑有「一二種困難、經與日卞商談後、巳告解決、</p>
<p>聞納資後　即可通行</p>
<p>字林報云、日軍當局因日憲兵一名遇刺、將大西路與愚園路區加以封鎖、迄未撤除、日方雖取嚴林手段、不准任何人出入、但聞昨（二日）有若干華人越封鎖綫而入公共租界、據稱彼等出資後、始准離該區、叉據消息靈通人士聲稱、日憲兵在大西路五十二衖口遇刺數分鐘後、日方即在該衖附近捕獲嫌疑犯逾十五人、內有穿工裝之俄人一名、</p>
<p>汚穢小道　綱開一面</p>
<p>日方對滬西界外馬路區實施封鎖、不准華人出入者、逾六十小時、至昨日始在愚園路與極司非而路間開放一巷、准許出入、該巷自愚園路六六八衖起、通過曲折汚穢、垃圾滿積之小巷而達極司非而路、日方突施封鎖、受其打擊者、非僅華人、卽外僑亦然、聞該區外僑已往兩日來未獲牛乳麵包者、殊不乏人、並有患病者、不得醫藥治療、</p>
<p>滬西電綫　又被割竊</p>
<p>咋日淸晨西區電綫被人割斷竊去六十碼、故該區電流關斷一小時半，電力公司人員謂不知電綫被何人竊去、至於滬西夜總會等雖在封銷區以西、顧客可經極司非而路等前往、故營業並不减色、</p>
<p>食米價格　駭人聽聞</p>
<p>該封鎖區商店、自出　之日起、卽全行停業、迄今猶求恢復、所有大小賭窟亦遭封閉、現該區域已寂靜如死市、糧食價格高至倍蓰、據甫由內出外之居民談、該區域米價、已漲至一百六十元一担、尚有出錢無米買之苦、共餘各種食物及飮料價格、亦高漲數倍、居民均有斷食之虞、</p>
<h3>中彈日兵　業已身亡</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報云、頃悉、日憲兵佐佐木上星期六日午後二時廿分在大西路五十二衖附近遭刺客一人開槍擊中後、先經送入宏恩醫院救治、移時轉送虹口、中途傷重殞命、該日憲兵遇刺後、係經西人懷特勒載送宏恩醫院、著名美籍醫師南斯氏立卽爲之療傷、據南醫師意見當時若施刀圭、卽能挽救該日兵生命、但渠未及施此手術時、日軍事當局已到院、下令將負傷日兵立刻移送虹口某醫院、致中途氣絕身亡、按佐佐木係於星期六日午後偕其他日憲兵兩名在大西路巡邏時遇刺、刺客立卽逸去、日方乃在該區實施封鎖、</p>
<h3>幼齡學童六人　遭逢悲苦命運　夜臥木凳日以餅乾充飢　　封鎖區內景況不堪想像</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報云、日憲兵封鎖區內億定盤路之工部局華童公學學童六人、年自六齡至十歲不等、被困校內、與家長失却聯絡者、已歷三晝夜、迄今仍藉餅乾充飢、不得返家、該六華童於上星期六日午後、離校較遲、適逢日方突施封鎖、遂與敎員五人、同困校內、入夜臥敎室內木凳上、僅毯三四條略禦寒氣、蓋華童公學並無寄宿設備也、按滬西被封鎖之學校、除華童公學外、尚有大西路六十五號之工部局小學與中學兩校、</p>
<p>女傭痛念　兩孩受苦</p>
<p>據華籍女傭一人述其不幸遭遇稱、其夫已棄之他去、彼扶麥五孩、家居滬西封鎖區、日問則在法租界外僑家幫傭爲生、自上星期六日起、卽未能越封銷綫返家、乃借宿法租界東家庽所、該婦料想其三孩並未困於封鎖區內、必寄居友家、但彼迄未與些三孩晤面、其餘兩孩最幼、則獨留封鎖區家中，亦無存糧果腹、此二孩所受痛苦、不堪設想、故該婦焦慮萬分，然亦無可奈何、封鎖區內華籍居民遭此慘遇者、必不止該婦一人也、</p>
<h3>華捕要求改善待遇　昨已提出條款　將由姚副警長轉交當局　俟召集董事會予以商決</h3>
<p>公共租界全體華捕爲要求改善待遇、曾推派代表、草就擬向當局提出之條款、但爲審愼起見、乃於前日重付討論、鄭重修改、當製定正款五項及附件十五項、現此項條款、巳照呈文格式書就、於昨日下午由華捕代表正式向華籍副警務長姚曾謨氏提呈、今日當可爲總巡包文少校接獲、渠對條款內容、經初步之考量後、卽將轉呈總辦費利溥、提出將於日內召集之董事會予以商決、現當局方面對華捕因迫於生活而要求改善待遇之舉、甚表諒解、並願早日解決、俾减除華捕之生活苦痛、至華捕方面、則均安心工作、靜待答覆、在雙方推誠相與下、此項爭執、不難在最短期內獲得圓滿解決、</p>
<p>靜候答覆</p>
<p>全體華捕代表咸深體大局、故一切舉措、均謹愼從事、昨日彼等於向當局提呈要求後、特印製告全體華捕佈告、遍貼界內各捕房、其原文如下、「查此决發生怠崗情事、純係因生活之高壓不得已所致、所幸全體同人、均能深明大義、顧全大體、不忍置數百萬市民之安危於罔顧、故能得各界無限之同情、自各捕房推派代表參加「臨時代表委員會後、共同硏討改善生活所必需之條件、幾經審議、已於本月二日下午六時決議通過、除將各條文繕就請求書提呈警務處轉呈工董會核批實施外、深望同人等本原來意旨、不負市民之殷望、靜候覆示、合理之解決、不難實現也、爲此通告俾衆週知、華捕臨時代表委員會啟、十二月三日」、</p>
<p>不難解決</p>
<p>大中社記者、昨日復訪晤華董虞洽卿氏、叩詢關於此一問題之發展、虞氏表示甚爲樂觀、謂由於華捕方面之體念時艱、深明大義、於呈請改善待遇外、已允不提其他要求、故問題已趨於簡單化、預料華捕方面之呈文、可望於明日（卽今日）提交警務處總巡包文、迅速予以考慮不難於短時期中、獲得合理之解決、</p>
<h3>寒衣捐成績良好　總會嘉勉　現在雖已結束　仍有捐款繳納</h3>
<p>全國寒衣徵募委員會上海分會、奉令自八月一日起徵募寒衣捐後、原定上海徵募寒衣捐額爲國幣五十萬元、經各界努力徵募、成續頗爲圓滿、總額已超過預定目的、今已於十一月底結束、捐獻極踴躍、開各業所捐之款、共的五十萬元、例如某業單獨認捐十萬元、至於文化敎育工界以及個人所捐之款、共的四五十萬元、上海所捐總額、的有百萬之譜、今雖已屆期結束、而各界仍有委託銀行匯渝寒衣捐、聞總會對上海孤島上市民之熱烈捐獻、深爲嘉許、業已電滬、對捐款者分別嘉勉、</p>
<h3>豆米業公會　緊急限制米價　當局面囑米業輪流訂購　常備十萬包照產價應市</h3>
<p>公共租界工部局何德奎副總辦、曾於日昨邀集米業領袖陳子彝·朱子香·符前耕·三氏、磋商具體辦法、何氏除垂詢米業市況外、並將卽面諭轉動米行同業擴大訂購產米十萬包、屆時按照產價供銷市塲、並輪流訂購、不使市場現貨減　、各該代表均認是項辦法確爲當務之急、允轉知同業照論辦理、</p>
<p>定期會商</p>
<p>兩當局爲積極進行穩定滬市整個民食起見、聞已定於本月十日（星期二）在江西路工部局會同米業領袖召開聯席會議、屆時虞洽卿氏將被邀出席、預料該項會議之結果、對於穩定滬市整個民食具體辦法、或將有所正式決定、屆時對於虞洽卿氏所建議大規模訂購洋米一節、亦將提出從長協商、蓋欲穩定滬市民食、端賴於兩租界當局不辭艱險、領導進行、又各界之共同合作、今當局旣有此種意向、諒滬市民食恐慌、可迎刃而解、</p>
<p>虞氏主張</p>
<p>關於民食問題、由於不良商人之操縱居奇、投機取巧、米價昨又猛漲二元、破新紀錄、情形嚴重，但據虞洽卿氏語大中社記者、市民實母庸發生恐慌、因滬上存米旣達七十萬包、足敷明年二月以前之供給、綽乎有餘、現滬上平時最需要者、卽爲二號西貢、來源並未斷絕、且在十二月底及一月初、越南新米卽可上市、屆時當局如能接受本人之請求、邀集各界、如銀錢菜新聞界、以最低之價格、及最小之水脚、訂購洋米、長存二十萬包、舉行公賣、除合理之利潤外、卽無人可操縱居奇、投機取巧、則民食問題、敢斷言可獲一勞永逸之解決、尚望各界予以鼓吹贊助、本人向工部局之書面建議、當可於明日（即今日）發出、</p>
<p>米糧會議</p>
<p>上海市豆米行業暨雜糧油餅業兩同業公會、鑒於米價頻頻高漲、非特攸關平民生計、且將有碍社會治安、除豆米行業公會曾於日昨召開臨時緊急會議、公告米市塲切實取締非法交易外、惟一般投機米蠧、仍陽奉陰違、收效殊鮮、市塲漲風未戢、茲悉上述兩業公會、爲洽商穩定整個米市具體辦法起見、爰已定於今日下午三時、假座愛多亞路十五號三樓、召開該兩業公會執監聯席委員會議、務望全體委昌準時出席與議、</p>
<p>緊急限價</p>
<p>上海市豆米行業同業公會昨繼續繕發第一號緊急公告云、爲緊急公告事、查近日米價繼漲、漫無限制、影響民生治安、所關甚巨、除已於本月一日公告市塲告誡同業、恪守市塲買賣規則外、茲鑒於情勢益見嚴重、爲冉作緊急之處置、自本月四日起、各種米價、絕對不准超越本月三日上午收盤之行情、務望買賣居間各方交易、一律遵照、幸勿故違、致干未便、如有暗盤越價等情事、定當陳報當局、從嚴懲辦、決不寬貸、特此公告、查食米限價已一再提高、昨市收盤價、又達歷來最高峯、茲雖限定不准超越、但卽照此限價、滬市大多數商民、亦屬難於担負、倘再有造謠滋事、藉端耍挾抬價情事、則前途險象環生、幸當局重視之、</p>

<p>上海羅民救濟協會、昨函各業、就原認各項捐款、繼續一年、以貫澈救濟初衷、原函云、本會辦理難民救濟以來、諸承各業踴躍輸將、或認薪給提成、或認營業提成、經常惠助、因之數萬災黎、得以免於飢寒、仰維盛德、感佩無窮、無如本會難胞給養、自歐戰爆發以來、激增數倍、捐款之來源有限、物價之暴漲無窮、應付之艱、有非楮墨所能盡述、</p>

<h3>乞丐收容所房屋　開始動工建築　共計可容納二千四百人　經費悉恃各界慈善捐款</h3>
<p>公共租界工部局發起設立之乞丐收容所、其房屋已在動工造築、咋日記者前往赫德路新加坡路參觀時、見該處預定建造之收容所房屋二十四間、已有外架三間搭成、據救世軍方面所定計劃、每間設床位十個、分爲兩排、每排五床、每一床可睡乞丐十人、共可容納二千四百人、收容所之　屋、將有充足之空氣與光綫、每間裝設玻璃窗十扇，</p>

<p>按工部局自去年以來卽考慮設立乞丐收容所之計劃、直至上决在跑馬廳舉行之納稅人大會中、始公開發表而此一計劃、遂於今冬開始實行、但建築工程、年內或恐不能完竣、惟一般希望在聖誕節前後、能有部份房屋完工、可容乞丐居住在內、</p>
<p>教養兼施　俾能自立</p>

<h3>哈同朱介人地租訟　黑市法價爭執　差額達國幣約四十萬元　最高法院當有公平裁判</h3>
<p>南京路一樂大至仝羽春一帶市房及住宅、的六十餘幢、均係吳縣朱介人（今年二十九歲、住梅白格路七十三弄六號）之所有產、惟係租地造屋、該處地產原屬公平洋行西雪爾漢璧禮所有、民國五年三月間朱之故父向公平洋行租賃、訂立二十五年長期租賃合同、租金每年分四期給付、卽一月一日。四月一日·七月一日·十月一日、每期（三個月爲一期）租金爲英鎊一千一百元、合同內幷載明付租按給付日之</p>
<p>倫敦外滙</p>
<p>率折合華幣支付、至房屋待租賃期滿、卽歸地主所有該租的訂定後、雙方履行多年、從無異言、迨民國十四年該處地產被儷穗哈同（卽英籍猶太人哈同之妻·原係中國人·嫁哈同後·入英國籍·今年巳八七五歲。現爲哈同花園及南京路二二一號哈同洋行主人）所買進、朱介人嗣繼承乃父履行租的、初與儷穗哈同毫無爭執、直辛民國二十六年底、朱因所付之租金、一期在國幣一萬七千數百元以內、雖較</p>
<p>中央銀行</p>
<p>掛牌一先令二使士半之滙率吃虧一二百元、以爲係經租人之佣金、亦無異議、及至民國二十七年間、第一二三期租金、擴儷穗哈同之帳單、第一期爲一萬八千五百二十六元三角二分、第二期爲一萬九千五百五十五元五角六分、第三期爲二萬九千七百四十六元四角二分、朱因儷穗哈同假借黑市外滙率、實行變相加租、故極力反對、因此儷穗哈同卽於是年具狀第一特區法院民庭、訴請判令被告朱介人依匯豐銀行掛牌之匯率給付</p>
<p>三期租金</p>
<p>三千三百鎊、而朱因當初所訂之租賃合同內、僅載明依付租日倫敦外滙率折合華幣支付、幷無以匯豐銀行之匯率爲準之規定、故請求駁回原告之訴、該案初審判決朱介人敗訴、上訴高二分院結果、又敗訴、朱不服、又上訴最高法院上海特區分庭、後經最高分庭審核結果、認爲原審判決失當、發回更審、其指示各點略謂、原判雖以訂的時只有滙豐匯率、故認的載之外匯率卽指</p>
<p>滙豐匯率</p>
<p>又以契約長期中滙豐是否長存、其掛牌外匯率是吾不至中止、皆無顧慮必要、若然、則當事人爲何不明定以匯豐滙率爲準、目旣屬長期租賃、則對於匯豐銀行是吾長此存在、其定外匯率、是吾或有中止、皆常情必有之疑問、原判謂此等顧慮爲不必要、究以何根據得此心證（二）縱令當事人向依滙豐匯率折合、但匯豐滙率今昔懸殊、當事人間是吾有不問相差如何、亦必依照滙豐匯率之合意、亦應審究、關於</p>
<p>匯率問題</p>
<p>財政部文電亦應注意、該案高二分院奉令更審結果、仍判決朱介人敗訴、其理由謂依倫敦外匯率折合華幣、卽係以華幣購買英鎊之市價、匯豐銀行掛牌之匯率卽市價、朱對於該判決仍不服、乃延律師劉崇佑·李文杰·何世枚·王劍鍔·周鯤等、又具狀最高分庭提起上訴、其理由略謂、被上訴人儷穗哈同向夾給予上訴人之帳單、僅謂依照幾先令幾便士</p>
<p>折合華幣</p>
<p>若干、從無滙豐匯率等訊載、現忽曲解租的文意、竟以黑市作法價、查租的內幷無市價及匯豐等字樣、更審法院不加深究、竟判准被上訴人之請求、絕難甘服、依據財政部渝綫匯字第一五四八號批示所載、應依照中央銀行掛牌之匯率爲準、依據司法行政部訓令訓字第二三五七號所載、當事人契的如果載明以法幣折合外幣給付者、以國家銀行規定之匯率爲準、則上訴人</p>
<p>根據租約</p>
<p>文意，請求依照中央銀行之滙率折合倫敦外滙率、恰合於法令、再查外滙率之意義、係兩國貨幣比換額數之謂、卽以英鎊與華幣比換之尺度以爲折合、此與所謂以華幣購買英鎊之市價、其意義絕然不同、若謂卽此意義、則當初爲何不的付英鎊而載明爲外匯率、顯見更審法院所爲裁判違法、該案朱介人自上訴後、已六度補陳上訴即由最高分庭因該案關係</p>
<p>國家法權</p>
<p>與經濟地位頗大、尚在審愼硏究中、而儷穗哈同對於民國二十七年十月及二十八年一月兩期租金、已於去年一月間向第一特區法院提起同樣訴訟、結果一二兩審亦勝訴、朱介人亦上訴最高分庭、近來儷穗哈同對朱又提起給付民國二十八年四月一日至今年七月一日六期租金之訴、共計六千六百英鎊、該案業經第一特區法院民庭長李琥數度研究結果、於上月二十七日宣告判決、朱介人應按期依滙豐銀行匯率、給付儷穗哈同租金六千六百鎊朱</p>
<p>奉判不服</p>
<p>現延王劍鍔律師向高二分院提起上訴、上述三案、實係一案、涉訟座年、迄未解決、兩造之勝訴與敗訴、均待最高分庭裁決、該租金訟案、中央銀行與滙豐銀行匯率相差甚鉅、依中央銀行匯率每期租金一萬七千餘元、若依匯豐銀行匯率最近一期、（卽十月一日）租金、已達國幣七萬六千八百兀、兩年餘之差額的合國幣四十萬元、該案關係華洋債務、至大至鉅、最高分庭當有公平之裁判、</p>

<h3>愚園路上</h3>
<p>— 高揚</p>
<p>碰巧，今天月底，一清早就得到愚園路去。</p>
<p>憶定盤路上一家酒樓在做喜事，門口的紅燈籠上，兩個鮮紅的烏字。門口吃酒的客人們交頭接耳，說是——</p>
<p>『今朝此地是討『小』呀，而且是『第三號』，聽說個位太太還是『羣玉坊出身的哩……』</p>
<p>『唉，今天烏先生的福氣不壞呵，碰到這樣的『黃道吉日』做喜事，真是『前世修來』個噢！』一個江北口音的老婆婆在嘴裏呢喃搭訕着。</p>
<p>電車，汽車到兆豐公園，都得『拋錨』，等候在那裏的『夥計們』便『勒令』停車，於是拿着棕刷，跟稀簿的漿糊，在車子的兩邊貼上四面『旗子』和五六張花花條子似的『標語。』每部車子終得煩他們手忙脚亂地化上四五分鐘，之後在旁邊『蓬蓬』敲上兩下，算是暗號『命令車子可以開走了。</p>
<p>『喂，小狗子，我們今天一早晨，賺了八毛錢哩！』</p>
<p>『我家媽媽生病，等錢用啦！』</p>
<p>是兩個『貼招紙』的大小孩在談着話。另外兩三個，則默不作聲，在等來的車子。</p>
<p>看看來的車子，差不多全貼好了，有的回來時已經撕碎了，於是他們又走去給補上，但撕掉的越來越多，他們也就算了。找起了漿糊鉛桶，向着白利南路朝北了，我望着四五個衣衫襤褸的背影，消失在一條弄口，遠遠的聽見『警察，老停手』得太早了吧！</p>
<p>又走上車子，玻璃窗上貼着『微募全市難童寒衣運動的紙頭，心有點感觸，但是貼在車箱外面的招貼廣告』却瞧不見了。</p>
<p>一陣西北風，打從開着的車窗裏鑽進來，在每一個坐客衣的都在拉拉緊，我却打了一個寒噤。</p>
<p>車子重又滾出了『越界』地段，一到靜安寺下了車，氣壓臉皮，突然鬆了下來。在鼻孔裏源深地透出了一口混濁的凉氣！</p>
<p>老大房車站旁，黑黝黝的人頭在攅動。在往日本來這裏是人擠的地方，但今天似乎帶有戰擾動的樣子。</p>
<p>車站旁站着的人们在談論——</p>
<p>『要是巡捕罷崗，我們這裏也打烊……』　　『只要大家看老大房上牌門，這裏的店家就會跟着一起『關門大吉』的！』</p>
<p>看樣子，今天的情形，恐怕不大安穩吧，下午像是會在愚園路一帶出什麼岔子似的，人們担心着！</p>
<p>『上海不會來個突變的吧？！』我暗自忖度着。</p>
<p>走過巡捕的崗位，跑進第二道鐵絲幽的『封鎖綫』，大家都好像從深淵裏抓了出來，得救了，重又來到了看見天日來『乾淨土』。可以我們『存有依賴心理的人們，也該醒醒了，越界情形不是榜樣嗎？』</p>
<p>回過頭，闐見車站有人又在撕車箱旁的『廣告』了，大概是一些窮孩子家裏沒有柴燒，撕回去　『燃料』的吧，我茫茫然不知所答。</p>
<p>霍桑探案</p>
<h3>舞后的歸宿</h3>
<p>— 程小青著</p>
<p>十二章　報告和解釋</p>
<p>『他在泥水中浸了一浸，便走進屋子，直到會客室中的地毯邊緣；接着他又回出來，從東邊走到前門口為止。他的目的，要人家知道有一個人從外面進去，又重新出來，所以從西邊進，東邊出，兩行之間，分別得清清楚楚，沒有一個鞋印交疊凌亂。可惜太清楚了，反而留下了破綻！』</p>
<p>『他在一進一出時，那雙自己的緞鞋，一定提在手中。他走到門口，就換了他自己的緞面布底鞋，又提了皮鞋，直接回樓上去。那時他的動作一定很小心，屋子裏的人又都睡着，趙伯友還不曾回來，故而他的計謀可以安然完成。他回到樓上，就用他的白巾把皮鞋抹了一抹，重新送還到壁櫥裏去；然後又上樓將兇馬抹乾淨了，就用這塊白巾包好，又將偷取的一切飾物，一起藏在什麼地方。接着他才上床去裝做睡眠的樣子，直到槍聲響後。金梅去敲他的房門，他才假裝醒來。人家自然疑不到他了。』</p>
<p>倪金壽忽道：『假使我們今天早晨就到樓上去搜一搜，這個秘密不是馬上就可以揭穿了嗎？』</p>
<p>霍桑點頭道：『是的，這是我們的失着。其實問題就在　重謀殺上。我們當時都覺得手槍問題比較急切而惹人注意，所以我就先注目到外圍問題，而把內綫問題暫時擱一擱了。』　　霍桑的解釋，到這裏已全部清楚。我也相信他雖出於推想，與事實一定相差不遠、霍桑在離開警廠以前，又叫余甘棠出來，經過了一番訓話，將他放掉。在訓話時，我也參加過幾句。（一八五）</p>
<h3>家長必讀</h3>
<p>— 志堅</p>
<p>通常我們總是說：「養不教，父之過；敎不嚴師之惰。」似乎「敎」的責任，完全是負在敎師身上的。做家長的只要把子女交託給敎師，便已無「過」。其實是並不然的。家長除了「養」以外，也還兼着「敎」的責任。賢明的父母，也常是子女最好的敎師。孟母為着自己兒子的前途，三次搬家；愛迪生如果沒有他母親的鼓勵和敎導，恐怕終於還只是被認為「壞蛋」而已。</p>
<p>如果你是子女的家，你怎樣管敎你的孩子？嚴厲的打罵呢；一噴水的溺愛呢；還是一切不管，隨你孩子自己的意思做呢？</p>
<p>進一步說，在管敎你的子女以前，你曾明瞭你子女的一切嗎？性情方面的，志願方面的等等。</p>
<p>（1）兒女的性情你知道嗎？</p>
<p>（2）兒女的志願你知道嗎？</p>
<p>（3）兒女對你的態度你知道嗎？</p>
<p>（4）你的兒女有責任心嗎？</p>
<p>（5）你的兒女有公德心嗎？</p>
<p>（6）你的兒女有自治能力嗎？</p>
<p>（7）兒女的特長你知道嗎？</p>
<p>（8）兒女的困難你知道嗎？</p>
<p>（9）兒女喜歡的書報你知道嗎</p>
<p>（10）你的兒女怎樣用錢你知道嗎？</p>
<p>（11）你的兒女有思想嗎？</p>
<p>（12）你的兒女有一技之長嗎？</p>
<p>（13）你的兒女關心世界大事嗎？</p>
<p>（14）你的兒女功課成績優良嗎？</p>
<p>（15）兒女身體的健康程度你知道嗎？</p>
<p>（16）兒女身體的衰弱原因你知道嗎？</p>
<p>（17）兒女發育時期的生活你知道嗎？</p>
<p>（18）兒女的身長，體重你知道嗎？</p>
<p>（19）你的兒女喜歡健身運動嗎？</p>
<p>（20）你和兒女有組織能力嗎？</p>
<p>（21）兒女假期生活的情形知道嗎？</p>
<p>（22）兒女所參加的團體你知道嗎？</p>
<p>（23）兒女最喜歡的娛樂你知道嗎？</p>
<p>（24）兒女所交的朋友你知道嗎？</p>
<p>（25）兒女每天有同你談話的機會嗎？</p>
<h3>「庖廚」太近了</h3>
<p>— 芒背</p>
<p>穿着什麼皮大的紳士淑女，往往很「討厭」看見一個把申報紙當做衣服的乞丐；而從什麼BAR裏而出來的先生小姐，也常常會『痛恨』看見一個用香烟罐和樹杈枝在撩着薄粥的『癟三』。</p>
<p>說起來埋由是很簡單的。就是：『……聞其聲，不忍食其肉，是故君子遠庖廚也』的道理！但不是完全這樣。</p>
<p>古時候君子為了『不忍』，所以要『遠庖廚』以後才肯『食其肉』。雖然看上去似乎有戰『愚』，其實心腸倒是極『軟』的；不然，又何妨在『宰猪塲裏煨肉吃！』</p>
<p>現在的人却畢竟不同了。『不忍』固然談不到，『討厭』和『痛恨』則有之。不過遠不能『責之太苛』……</p>
<p>因為，推想其所以『討厭』『痛恨』的原因，一定是為了自己穿得太暖吃得太飽，而橫在面前的却是那一副『酸相』，而有點『慚愧』（還不如說是『難為情』）起來，而……致於『一怒之下』（這是『老羞成怒』），就發生了『討厭』和痛恨的情緒。</p>
<p>所以歸根結底，這到底是因為『庖廚』太近了，如旭遠一戰也許不會這樣；不然，用棉花塞了耳朶也仍舊可以『大食其肉』的！</p>

<p>㳺藝界</p>
<h3>電影藝術的學徒</h3>
<p>— 舜裔</p>
<p>安南僑生楊華一席談</p>
<p>楊華他具有任何一個南國青年所具有的習性：豪放非常，能冒險，有熱情，生活得很活躍。他看起書來是『雜』，文學，戲曲，電影，中英文小說等等。一天，與我談了很興，他說：『我從小從長在『安南』，我媽現在還和姊妹們住着。我本想決定先回去，再跑進『雲南』讀『西南聯大』。倘使進不去；邊境封鎖起來，我就在『安南住下』。他熱情奔放地滔滔說他底願望：『請你們經常的寄書籍雜誌和報紙給我。我可以把我把知道的告訴給『安南』任何地方的僑胞。我再把僑胞的情况和安南的風土人情，政局等寫通訊給你們。還有，我姊姊書是在『安南』唸的，完全是一個『安南』人，她可以把『安南』的『文學經典』說給我譯成中文——，』但自我進了『國聯』受訓練，就不讀『大學』了，我去演戲拍成電影。關於電影的話，我曉得他已經上了好多次鏡頭，他聽不願意『古裝。』有一位記者朋友，告訴我』卜萬蒼『很愛重他。——為了這，晚間在霞飛路上和閒蕩的時候，我好奇地問他他：『我眞不懂，現在的大明星總以自己是大學生為榮，好像對人說『我不單是拍電影做小生呀，我是大學生，我將來要怎麼怎麼地，』為什麼大學生的你竟會放棄大學不讀，專拍電影做學徒？』</p>
<p>『這很簡單，』他嚴肅地微笑了，『我願意做一個電影藝人的學徒』。停頓了片刻：『在大學業裏唸書是一種生活，拍電影自己唸書是一種生活，不過我覺到比較上更適宜些吧了』</p>
<p>他是一個電影藝術的學徒，在復旦大學讀書時的姓名叫『何希欽』『楊華』是他時電影團以後的『藝名』。他纔二十二歲，有美麗的未來，我禁不住祝福他。</p>
<h3>王先生飄流紀</h3>
<p>— 羅村</p>
<p>小白臉『王老五』，結識『一代尤物』『茶花女』，拋棄『天倫』之樂，作『夜奔』之舉，逃至『富春江』交結『楚覇王』與『黃天覇』，自稱『三劍客』，强收富家『女人』及『馬路天使』作『一夜皇后』，遂被『荒江女俠』『秦良玉』逐往『六十年後上海漢』，又與綽號『夜明珠』『李三娘』鬧『初戀』之憂，不久卽釀成『桃花新聞』，鬧出『播音台大血案』的亂子，卽被拘入『新地獄』，幸被其『海天情侶』『孟姜女』救往『飛花村』，渡其『自由天地』之日，未幾卽生『掌上珠』『小俠女』，『遂成富貴榮華』之家，過其『金銀世界』之生世。然好量不常，在『火燒紅蓮寺』之昌，妻女『乞丐千金』已變彷徨『十字街商頭』的『迷途的羔羊』，後得『鑛山騎俠』『小博士』之助，在『恐怖之　』冒着『雷雨』趕往『鍍金的城』，寄居『七重天』公寓，在人靜之夜，聽得『苦兒救母記』的『夜半歌聲』，遂妻女重逢重，互嘆『王先生吃飯難之苦！後得靈機一轉，』『王先生生財有道』出當『珍珠衫』，收買雅號『紅花瓶』之『潘巧雲』作『搖錢樹』，演出淫劇『地獄控艷記』，『巨金聘請刁劉氏』『武則天』參加表演『隨宮春色』，後被稱『黃海大盜』者勒索十萬巨金，王先生遂心中大彈『琵琶記』，在日出之前，偕同妻女走上『新人道』往求老先生『孔夫子』相救，但中途忽遇『絕代佳人』『孟麗君』，重投情綱，又遇『雲裳仙子』『王寶劍』，使其左右為難，後遂妻命踏上『王先生回到農村去』的『大路』，以達其改過自新之路。</p>
<h3>金都大戲院提早開幕</h3>
<p>— 星星</p>
<p>禮金將移庇寒所救難　第一片決定為『西廂記』</p>

<h3>U.S. Congress Unanimously Approves $100 Million Loan to China; U.S. to Supply China with Military Aircraft and Implement New Steps in Embargo Against Japan</h3>
<p>Washington - The Senate Banking Committee and the House Coinage Committee unanimously passed a measure for the United States to loan $100 million to China. Half of this amount will be allocated from the Exchange Stabilization Fund, and the remaining half will be disbursed by the Export-Import Bank. According to President Roosevelt's statement on the matter at the end of this week, $50 million of this loan will be used for currency protection and management of the exchange rate between Chinese and American currencies, while the remaining $50 million will be for general purposes. After the loan was passed by the committees of both houses, Treasury Secretary Morgenthau explained the details of the proposed agreement to the two committees, saying that his purpose in attending Congress had been achieved, that is, he had received a vote of confidence. "We will now immediately conclude this transaction with China," he said. Secretary of State Hull stated the general policy of the United States in assisting the Chinese government under the leadership of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, saying that he believed the loan agreement to China was extremely important and, under the current circumstances, the least we could do. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>Washington - Dollar diplomacy now has a new meaning. The United States originally had a $200 million gold fund for stabilizing foreign exchange, which will now be used as a backing for American diplomacy. According to informed sources, the U.S. government plans to lend China $50 million in gold dollars, which is the first measure of the new policy. (Haitong Telegraph, 3rd)</p>
<p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Declares Loan Safeguards Peace</p>
<p>Washington - The Joint Committee of the Senate and House of Representatives yesterday unanimously passed a proposal of confidence in the executive branch's economic assistance to China. Secretary of State Hull suddenly attended a secret meeting of the Senate Banking and Currency Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee to listen in. President Roosevelt, in announcing the $50,000,000 loan to China on Saturday, had said Treasury Secretary Morgenthau would publicly propose to the joint committee to grant a credit of $50 million to China to help stabilize the Chinese legal tender. It is understood that Morgenthau told the committee that if the status quo in the Far East is to be maintained, assistance to China is most needed. If China can obtain sufficient economic assistance, it can establish a solid defense. If so, it can indirectly prevent Japan from further openly disregarding American interests in the Pacific or creating another chaotic incident. The Treasury Secretary solemnly declared that the loan was intended to safeguard peace and was only a consistent policy of the United States. It is said that Hull expressed great approval of Morgenthau's remarks. It is also reported that Morgenthau pointed out that even if the United States fully supports China's currency, it will not harm its own stabilization fund. Morgenthau also said that this was an excellent economic stance. Secretary of State Hull said, "This is the minimum amount of assistance we can give to China." Morgenthau told reporters after the meeting that he had not made any definite decisions because he believed in Congress. He also pointed out that last year he told the Senate committee that he hoped to receive "guidance" before using the stabilization fund to help foreign countries in the war. Morgenthau said, "I can now proceed directly with the work because I have completed the procedures. I will return to the Treasury Department to complete the mission as soon as possible." Hull expressed satisfaction with the committee's actions during his sudden attendance. Republican Senator Townsend of Delaware was one of the numerous senators who participated in the meeting. He predicted that the executive branch would not encounter serious opposition from the Republican side in implementing this plan. Townsend also said that, in fact, there would be no need to use new legislation to speed up aid to China. Morgenthau also said that the government has not yet decided on all the detailed plans for stabilizing Chinese currency, but it is undoubtedly the case that this plan will include the United States purchasing Chinese yuan at a certain price. The fixed price of the Chinese yuan is currently being negotiated in Washington by Song Ziwen, the former Chinese Minister of Finance. Morgenthau also announced that, to date, of the $99,000,000 in American loans that China has borrowed since 1931, $81,500,000 has been repaid. Morgenthau also said that, out of respect for the opinions of Song Ziwen and the Chinese government, the United States cannot formally publish the content of this matter until negotiations are established in Washington and Song Ziwen agrees to publish it. Morgenthau solemnly declared that the stabilization fund will only be used for "stabilization work" and will not be issued in the form of loans. Morgenthau said, "We only buy Chinese yuan with US dollars." Morgenthau said that Chinese currency had fallen sharply before, but recently it has been quite stable. He also said that the result of the devaluation of Chinese currency would greatly increase the living standards of the Chinese people. In order to improve the internal situation in China, we are thinking of balancing China's legal tender. (United Press, 3rd)</p>
<p>China to Order Light Bombers from the U.S. Soon</p>
<p>Washington - Chinese diplomatic circles here said today that President Roosevelt's agreement to loan $100 million to China has enabled China to first purchase 50 light bombers from the United States for the purpose of protecting the Burma Road and defending against Japanese air raids. U.S. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau revealed last night that the Senate Banking Committee and the House Currency Committee had given Morgenthau and Secretary of State Hull a unanimous vote of confidence regarding the allocation of half of the promised loan from the $200 million Exchange Stabilization Fund. The detailed procedures for the aircraft purchase advance payment have not been explained. It is speculated that the U.S. Treasury Department will purchase 50 million Chinese yuan, enabling the Chinese National Government to obtain the equivalent value in U.S. dollars to pay the aircraft manufacturers. The U.S. Exchange Stabilization Fund has never been used for other purposes other than stabilizing currency prices. When the European war first broke out, Morgenthau requested the committee in charge to give guidance before using the Treasury fund, so this time Morgenthau said, "The Senate and House committees have given me a unanimous vote of confidence, and I will act as quickly as possible on the advice of the lawyers." (International News Service, 3rd)</p>
<p>Two Squadrons of U.S. Fighter Planes May Be Sold to China</p>
<p>Washington - The rapid strengthening of the U.S. Far East policy last night seemed to have gone beyond economic aid to China and was leaning towards supplying General Chiang Kai-shek's fighting forces with important military aircraft and other military supplies. This move followed yesterday's unanimous passage by the Joint Committee of the Senate and House of Representatives to loan China $100 million in U.S. dollars. After the committee passed the matter, Secretary of State Hull stated that the U.S. Far East policy would be based on raw materials and economic aid to China to the extent possible, because the Chongqing government is currently fighting against aggressive forces. The result of China's prolonged war against Japan is sufficient to prevent Japan from building the so-called "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere." Official American sources declared last night that there is now a "good opportunity" for a portion of the U.S. Army's aircraft to be given to the Chongqing government. It is said that these aircraft are not needed by the U.S. first-line aircraft, but they are more than sufficient to fight against Japan's best aircraft. It is generally known that U.S. officials have been discussing the issue of assisting China with raw materials, which was recently discussed in Washington with the Chinese Air Force delegation. The Secretary of State remained silent yesterday on questions raised about whether the United States would make another loan to China to be used to purchase American fighter planes. Unconfirmed rumors were circulating here last night that two squadrons of U.S. Army fighter planes recently sent to the Philippines for reinforcement may be sold to China. It is said that the procedure for selling them to China will be that the Army will first return the planes to the manufacturers, who will then sell them to the Chinese government. Observers recalled that Secretary of War Stimson told reporters when he approved the planes' orders to the Philippines that the planes were "the latest type of fighter planes" and not "training planes." At the same time, in economic terms, government officials also indicated that new embargo steps against Japan would soon be implemented. Colonel Maxwell, chairman of the Army-Navy Munitions Board, issued a statement last night advocating tightening restrictions on the export of aviation gasoline. His statement is in line with the views of other parts of the executive branch that major military raw materials will be stopped from being shipped to Japan in order to weaken Japan's military apparatus. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau said yesterday in supporting the loan to China from the Senate and House that the biggest of the questions the committee considered yesterday was whether to determine if China was at war or at peace. He said that the committee finally believed that since the U.S. government had not implemented neutrality laws on the Sino-Japanese war, China was, in a technical sense, at peace. He added, "This is a part of the Chinese situation. China has made the executive branch recognize that China now needs assistance." (United Press, 3rd)</p>
<p>U.S. Newspapers Unanimously Endorse Large Loan to China</p>
<p>Washington - Editorials in national newspapers today unanimously condemned the Japanese-Wang Nanjing treaty and endorsed the new U.S. loan to China. This clearly shows the U.S. position on the situation arising from Japan's recognition of the Nanjing regime. Some newspapers even said that, in addition to the loan, the United States intends to assist China with American raw materials, such as aircraft, to protect the Burma Road. The Washington Post said that this farce, which Japan had to perform, was merely to save face and that the U.S. loan to China was appropriate because Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek refused to participate in Japan's new order. The New York Times said that the loan was a condemnation of the Nanjing treaty and that the Japanese knew it, too. The American people wholeheartedly support America's posture, which lets the small Eastern country cooperating with Hitler know that America will not stand idly by. There is a widespread feeling in America that any possible aid to China should be part of America's own defense program. China's valiant resistance deserves praise. It is thanks to the strength of the Chinese army that the United States has been able to accumulate Eastern raw materials in time and focus all its efforts on helping Britain and strengthening its own defenses. The New York Times praised China as an honest debtor, saying that public opinion supports granting a new loan to China so that China can restrain Japan and prevent it from engaging in new acts of aggression. Seymour, the foreign news editor of the Scripps-Howard newspaper system, pointed out that the Nanjing Treaty was a failure, not a victory, for Japan, and the Washington Star also published an editorial entitled "The Nanjing Farce." (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>Japanese Newspapers Criticize U.S. Far East Policy</p>
<p>Tokyo - The "Kokumin Shimbun" today joined other newspapers in vigorously criticizing the U.S. Far East policy. The newspaper said that the Sino-Japanese war now involves not only China and Japan, but the United States has also been drawn into the vortex. The "Kokumin Shimbun" declared, "We should note that the conflict between China and Japan is no longer a dispute between China and Japan, but has evolved into part of the war between the old and new orders. The United States, in the name of peaceful democracy and aid to Britain, is maintaining order and preventing the rise of Japan, Germany, and Italy. In other words, the United States is thinking of undermining peace in the Far East, plunging it into chaos for a long time, so that Japan is exhausted and unable to cope with future important developments." The "Kokumin Shimbun" also said that the appointment of Admiral Nomura as ambassador to Washington would not improve relations between the United States and Japan. "We should know that relations between the two countries are extremely tense and cannot be viewed with optimism." The "Miyako Shimbun," referring to the reported Anglo-American joint agreement in the Southeast Pacific, said, "The current situation is either devour others or be devoured by others." The newspaper warned, "In the Tripartite Pact of Germany, Italy, and Japan, Japan is betting everything. We will never allow Britain and the United States to interfere in the Greater East Asia area, because that is Japan's living space. The establishment of a new order in East Asia requires the elimination of all anti-Japanese elements and the determination to strike down third countries that support Chongqing. It is time for Japan to declare its belligerent rights to the belligerent countries, because only then can Asia for Asians be completed quickly. Only by making such a strong resolution can Japan realize the new order in East Asia. "The announcement of the new U.S. loan to China was the subject of most Tokyo newspapers, which unanimously declared that President Roosevelt announced the new loan on the day that Japan formally recognized the "Nanjing government," which is particularly noteworthy. The "Yomiuri Shimbun" said that the U.S. loan, coupled with British Foreign Secretary Halifax's announcement that he would grant Chongqing a new loan, shows that the United States and Britain are stepping up economic pressure on Japan. Japan should now rise up to block all supply lines to Chongqing and take appropriate measures to undermine the consolidation of the Chinese legal tender and take some steps to destroy all attempts to prevent the construction of a new order in East Asia.

<h3>Burma Railway Achieves Profit</h3>
<p>Rangoon - The Burma Railway has achieved a profit after nine years of losses. This is due to Chinese imports and exports passing through the Yunnan-Burma Highway. The railway report shows that the net income for the year ending March 1940 was 250,000 rupees. Since the Chinese government moved its import and export trade to Burma at the end of last year, railway transport has increased, so that the railway's total revenue is no less than 1.3 million rupees, compared to only 600,000 rupees in the previous year. Without Chinese trade, this year would not only not have a surplus, but would also have a deficit. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>

<h3>The Next Blitzkrieg by Germany and Italy</h3>
<p>The people of the British Isles have long regarded the English Channel as a natural barrier, and the winter snow, rain, and fog as a natural cover. Moreover, their morale is high, and they are in high spirits. The so-called superior conditions of timing, geography, and human harmony are now all in place. The armchair strategists have long said that if Hitler does not achieve a decisive victory in his war against England before this winter, then even if he has plans for a clever invasion of England, he must wait until the weather warms up next spring before implementing them. These kinds of arguments certainly have their merits. However, at a time when survival is at stake and there is a sense of walking on thin ice, how can those who bear the heavy responsibility of a nation dare to rely on such observations and become complacent? However, there are also some people, even members of Parliament, who therefore want to solicit the consent of the belligerent countries to have a temporary truce around Christmas, so that the combat personnel can spend this holiday in "peace." Although this proposal has been dismissed by the British government, the general psychological tension in Britain seems to have disappeared with the autumn wind, which cannot be concealed. In addition, the Nazi war machine, since crushing the resistance of France, has not performed for a long time, except for the Air Force. This is enough to make the public gradually dissipate their long-standing impression of its attacking and destructive power, and gradually give rise to a relaxed illusion. Not only that, but the Italian military's setback in Greece, and the situation in the Balkans being constrained by Bulgaria's strength, are also enough to make the public think that Germany and Italy's plans for an offensive in the Near East have failed and that they are now at a loss. These views have their basis. However, I ask, is Britain safe in winter? Has the Nazi war machine reached the end of its rope? Has the situation in the Balkans made Germany and Italy retreat? Not only does no one dare to affirm this boldly, but these situations should be regarded as containing the best conditions for the Nazis to implement their "blitzkrieg tactics." Leaving aside all other conditions, it should be known that seizing the opportunity when the enemy is complacent and inattentive, and launching a lightning-like action to catch the enemy off guard and force them to surrender, is precisely the essence of the so-called blitzkrieg tactics! The past is vivid, with blood and tears, and the lessons are not far away, so we should be vigilant!</p>
<p>From the perspective of Germany and Italy: The key to Germany's decisive victory is to have a quick and decisive battle. Hitler has indeed defeated France, which is known for its army, in one fell swoop. This is the effect of a quick and decisive battle. Fortunately, it was decisive, otherwise, if it had been in a stalemate for three or two years or more, and the forces of the British and French overseas colonies had converged, it would be a great question whether Germany could have won. This principle is now being used to deal with Britain, although it has been greatly discounted, but waiting a year or six months later will definitely be even worse than now. Even now, Britain's naval blockade is becoming tighter and tighter. Since the Italian-Greek war began, the battle of Taranto has suddenly wiped out half of the Italian Navy, and the British Navy's seizure of the Greek ports has further strengthened Britain's control over the Mediterranean. From this alone, one can imagine how serious the British naval blockade is. Therefore, the urgent task now facing Germany and Italy is, regardless of which direction, to break out a path as soon as possible. They must not sit and wait for the only resources to be depleted by massive consumption, and ultimately suffer an irreparable defeat. From this, it can be seen that Germany has always had a reason and a necessity to adopt blitzkrieg tactics.</p>
<p>One of the biggest reasons why Germany has not launched large-scale external invasions in the past few months is that it has been engaged in reorganizing and developing the conquered countries. So far, this work has probably achieved considerable success. Autumn has passed, and the agricultural products, livestock, and poultry of various countries are precisely the season for collecting and accumulating, which form Germany's war food. All factories, given time, will also become part of the Nazi production machine. After this considerable period of military occupation, the appeasement policy towards the conquered, as well as the work of suppression and purging, must have reduced their worries about the rear. All of this has of course created the instinct and dependence of the Nazis to continue to invade and expand outwards. Apart from these, the thorny issue of Italy's war against Greece is certainly an urgent task that Germany and Italy must resolve. Not only has Germany and Italy's desire for the Balkans been reversed, but also, with Britain providing substantial assistance to Greece and the vague support of Turkey, Germany and Italy's prestige in the Balkans and beyond has begun to waver, and the so-called "New Order" has suddenly suffered a miserable and brutal blow. If Germany and Italy want to overcome this difficulty, they must try to defeat Greece with all their strength, and then invade the Balkans. It is even better to strike and conquer England with a blitzkrieg strategy.</p>
<p>In summary, let us analyze the possible directions of Germany and Italy's future "blitzkrieg." There are probably no more than three paths: The first is to suddenly attack the British Isles. Recently, the British "News Chronicle" solemnly pointed out that Germany's systematic bombing of major industrial centers in Britain is noteworthy and that it may be a prelude to Hitler's attempt to land in Britain. The difficulty of this move lies in the inability to break the power of the British fleet in the English Channel, so landing is difficult, and the subsequent strength and resupply after landing are even more difficult. The second is to suddenly advance into the Balkans. This move may inevitably risk another great injustice and require the occupation of Yugoslavia or Bulgaria in one fell swoop from the land, and then attack Greece and encompass the Balkans. The third is to seize the Strait of Gibraltar from Spain and suddenly break into Africa. The main problem with this move is Spain's attitude: will Germany and Italy use Spain as a pretense and directly do it themselves, or will they act behind Spain with Germany and Italy as their backing? Among the three paths, the gains and losses are really difficult to express in a word, but it cannot be denied that each has the possibility of being adopted!</p>

<h3>Spokesperson for the Military Council Discusses the Week's War Situation, November 24th to 30th</h3>
<p>Chongqing: The spokesperson for the Military Council discusses the week's war situation (from November 24th to 30th).</p>
<p>Hubei Province: Before November 24th, the Japanese troops stationed in small strongholds in Tongcheng, Jiuling, and Xiantao in southern Hubei Province frequently caused disturbances, but were repeatedly defeated. In addition, the plague was prevalent near Tongcheng, leading to a high mortality rate, and they were no longer capable of action. From the 24th, the Japanese troops entrenched on both sides of the Xiang River in Dangyang, Jingmen, Zhongxiang, and Suixian suddenly launched simultaneous attacks, using dozens of aircraft and dozens of tanks for cover.

The remaining troops attacked near Lexiangguan from Jingmen but were ambushed from the northwest and suffered heavy losses. To the east of the Xiang River, Chinese troops lured them to Changshoudian and Zaijiadian, using the terrain and fierce firepower to encircle and disperse them from high ground. On the 27th, the Japanese troops who attacked from Suixian were driven into the Tangjiachong and Gujiawan areas. The Chinese army has now recovered Jingmingpu, Kuaihuoling, Lishan, Jinjiling, and other places on the front lines of the Xianghua Road.</p>

The Chinese army has also recovered strongholds such as Guduishan and Huashiya south of the Tongpu Railway. Chinese troops bypassed Zhangmao Avenue and attacked Bazhengcun, Dakuancun, and other strongholds such as Kennanzhuang and Shengru Tan, disrupting traffic between Qu and Qinxian. The Japanese troops in Zhongyang, Quwo, and Jiexian were all attacked by the Chinese army. Along the Pinghan Road and Daoqing in northern Henan, the Japanese troops have been subdued after days of mopping-up operations by the Chinese army. The Japanese troops in Luoshan in southern Henan have repeatedly attempted to attack but were all repelled.</p>
<p>Jiangxi and Guangdong: Chinese troops repeatedly attacked Japanese strongholds southeast of Nanchang.

<h3>Continued Clashes on the Thai-Vietnamese Border; One French Warship Said to Have Been Seized by Thai Forces; New Progress Seen in Negotiations Between the Two Sides</h3>
<p>Bangkok: There continue to be minor clashes along the Thai-Vietnamese border, and there have also been encounters between the air forces of both sides. Local officials claim that a Thai plane flying over the Nakhon Phanom area of Thailand encountered French forces along the Vietnamese border and was fired upon with machine guns.

<p>Hanoi: The Thai capital's radio station has issued a message saying that Vietnamese people who attempted to cross the border to escape to Thailand were shot at by French troops. Local officials have now issued a public statement denying this, saying that many French priests and nuns living in Thailand have not only been subjected to abuse, but have also been expelled from the country. For example, Bishop Maraful and three nuns from Suer were expelled and arrived in Gai Ke City from Thailand on November 29th. They said that they were locked in iron cages by the Thai authorities for ten hours, and then expelled from the country, without being allowed to take any possessions. The next day, they met Father Escofon and Sister Ivona in Savannakhet City, and learned that they had also been forced to leave Ubon City in Thailand.

<p>Hanoi: Today, hostile actions have begun in the areas of Laos and Cambodia along the Thai-Vietnamese border. This situation is a reaction to what the government calls retaliation carried out yesterday. However, the details of the so-called retaliation are still unknown due to the activities of the local fifth column. It is said that the local fifth column is responsible for cutting off telephone and telegraph lines between the Lao border and the war zone. Transportation between cities in the Mekong River basin and Hanoi is completely threatened. Although Hanoi officials remain calm, they have begun to express that the situation will worsen. However, officials also said that the Vietnamese people would rather be shattered jade than cede an inch of land to Thailand. The unrest in Cochinchina has gradually subsided. French planes are still bombing the railway junction of Mato (transliteration). Officials also said that after a French river boat patrolling the Mekong River was fired upon with machine guns by Thai forces, one French crew member was killed and several were injured.

<h3>Greek Troops Fight Bravely Through Snow; Major Victory Gained in the South; Right Wing Advances Towards the City of Elbasan; The Italian Alpine Division Annihilated</h3>
<p>London: Italian troops are currently retreating from Pogradec towards Elbasan, with Greek troops pursuing closely behind. However, the most significant victory for the Greek troops was in the south. Today, Italian troops have been driven to the highlands in front of Telvino. Telvino is a town located on the highway between Argirocastro and Santi Quaranta, which are important supply bases. Currently, this road is under Greek artillery fire. It seems that the Italian troops intend to continue shifting their supply lines northward. (3rd day Reuters telegram)</p>
<p>Sofia: Wireless broadcasts from Athens received here state that Greek troops, fighting through snow, repelled a full-scale counterattack by Italian troops yesterday and are continuing to advance. It is said that in the northern area around Elbasan, the Italian counterattacking forces suffered huge losses and retreated. Greek troops are also bombarding the retreating Italian troops with continuous and intense artillery fire. The broadcast also stated that the Greek occupation of Pogradec "has given the victorious Greek troops a new horizontal line, as that place is the strongest Italian position in Albania." (3rd day United Press telegram)</p>
<p>Southern Monastir: The Italian troops facing the Greek right-wing front in northern Albania are now retreating from the source of the Skumbi River towards the important town of Elbasan, which is eighteen miles from the Albanian capital. Due to heavy snow and thick clouds, British and Greek air forces have not been able to fully bomb and disrupt the retreating Italian troops. However, the Greek troops are advancing north from a village west of Moscopole, having crossed the Linyka Mountains and making a fan-shaped advance towards the Kamia Mountains. The Greek front line now stretches from the western slope of the Kamia Mountains, north to Mount Inclaire and Maglişt, north of Pogradec. Italian troops in the highlands near there have shelled Pogradec. Large numbers of Greek troops on the Mokra Mountains are making a fan-shaped advance towards Lake Ohrid. On Sunday, artillery units from both sides exchanged fire, but general warfare was greatly hampered by snowfall, as snow was five to six feet deep in some places. According to messages from Corfu, Italian planes bombed the city and surrounding areas on Sunday, damaging some residences and shops. A church was hit and collapsed, and several people were killed or injured. The city has no military targets. According to recent news, the Greek left wing has now placed the supply line from Argirocastro to the port of Santi Quaranta within range of their artillery fire. British bombers are also attacking that line. (3rd day Reuters telegram)</p>
<p>Budapest: Here it was listened to a Greek broadcast, pursuing the retreating Italian troops, the Greek forces have crossed Pogradec by thirty kilometers, also saying that the Italian Alpine division can be regarded as completely annihilated, and the Italian military formation on the northern front has no hope. The number of Italian prisoners reached several thousand. It is said that the Greek army is now in a stable position and is continuing to advance in the Telvino area. The Italian troops retreating in Santi Quaranta abandoned artillery, machine guns and other military supplies. (3rd day United Press telegram)</p>
<p>Athens: Greek authoritative sources learned this morning that the Italian front line in Albania completely collapsed last night, and the Italian troops in general retreat were violently pursued by Greek troops. According to official announcements, the Greek army has occupied many important mountain positions and captured thousands of Italian soldiers. According to a report from a war correspondent on the front line, the Greek offensive in the past few days has given the Greek army a dominant position in southern Albania. Italian troops retreating from Pogradec were destroyed by artillery fire from Greek artillery, and most of them were destroyed by artillery fire. It is said that 5,000 Italian troops were captured in the northern region yesterday alone. Unconfirmed news said that another 3,000 Italian troops were captured in the central part of the front line, and it was rumored that the Italian troops there had been cut into several sections. Greek troops in the south have the potential to occupy Telvino. If that city falls, the Greek army will further occupy Putida. It is said that the Greek army has consolidated new positions near Plamiti. It is reported that the Italian troops in the north are now collapsing towards Tirana. (3rd day International News Agency telegram)</p>
<p>Athens: A United Press correspondent with the Greek army on the Epirus front recently reported that the Greek army has now occupied an important fortified village on the Albanian coast. Italian troops may be forced to carry out a general retreat on this coastal front. This large village, which constitutes the base of operations in the coastal area, was occupied by the Greek army this morning after three days of artillery fire and aerial bombardment. The reporter continued that because shells were constantly falling on the village and planes were dropping countless tons of bombs on Italian field artillery and troop concentrations, the Italian troops had to abandon this important stronghold. The village is the main point of the Italian defense of the coast. The fall of the village may lead to a complete withdrawal of Italian troops from this area. The reporter also said, "I have heard that the Italian troops are withdrawing their heavy artillery, and I fear that a general retreat has already begun." Since the beginning of the war, the progress of the Greek army on the Epirus front has not been surprising, but it has been steady and solid. In the past 48 hours, the Greek army has advanced more than ten kilometers along the entire line. The Greek army has continuously launched attacks at various points and has already divided the Italian Eleventh Army into several small teams. This is the same tactic used in the attack on Korytsa. It was also announced yesterday by the British General Headquarters here that British air force bombers had damaged important bridges and destroyed many sections of a highway used by Italian troops in southwestern Albania to transport their reinforcements. Despite heavy anti-aircraft fire, British planes still flew low to bomb. Military buildings in the Ftelini area were also heavily damaged. (3rd day United Press telegram)</p>
<p>Anti-Italian Rebellion Spreads in Albania; Italian Rear Threatened</p>

<p>Moscopoli: The Greek army's advance has been slowed by heavy snow up to three feet deep in many places and by storms, but the Greek army maintains its initiative and has established a new line on the far north. Italian troops are secretly deploying new defenses on three consecutive mountain ridges known as "Verdun." The area is near Lake Ohrid and Pogradec, and reinforcements and new weapons are being delivered by air. The Greek commander intends to preemptively break through the Italian defenses and has ordered an immediate attack along the entire line. Italian resistance is fiercer than before.

<p>Italians Claim Victory in Counterattack; Holding Coastal Bases in Albania</p>
<p>Rome: An Italian military bulletin said that the fierce attacks by all Greek armies have been repelled. The Greek army suffered heavy losses. Italian armies are now using the most powerful heavy artillery to counterattack the Alpine Squad, destroying Greek cavalry. Prime Minister Mussolini has now allocated an additional US$70 million for the military to increase reinforcements. In the Argirocastro area, the Greek army is attacking Italian hastily constructed defensive works with all its might, and the attacking forces seem to have an entire army corps. But the Italian army stands firm and counterattacks. Both sides have suffered heavy losses, making it the most fierce and bloody battle since the start of the war. (3rd day United Press telegram)</p>
<p>Rome: This afternoon, the Italian military headquarters announced that the Greek army and the Italian 9th and 11th Divisions are fighting fiercely.

<p>Scottish Highlanders Brave and Good at Fighting; Three Reasons for Slow Advance</p>
<p>London: Forty-eight days have passed since Italy's war against Greece. A military expert here recently discussed the Greek-Italian war, praising the skillful command of the Greek generals and the brave resistance of the lower-ranking officers and soldiers, which resulted in great victories. It is said that after the Greek army captured Korytsa, unless the enemy attacked by way of Yugoslavia or Bulgaria, Salonika in Greece would not be in danger of direct attack. The Greek army's advance is now slowing down for three reasons: (1) The Greek army is now operating in very difficult and unfamiliar territory; (2) Its transportation lines are long and difficult to maintain; (3) Italian reinforcements have arrived. The expert also said that the Greek army has captured thousands of enemy troops. The Italian troops surrendered only after being surrounded and cut off from food. For example, an Italian Alpine regiment that invaded the Pindus Mountains was surrounded and surrendered only after being cut off from supplies for five days, which shows that the Greek army must fight hard to advance. British aid to Greece is not limited to air support or military equipment; British troops have recently participated in some decisive battles on the Italian-Greek front.

<h3>British Planes Bomb Italian Troops in Africa</h3>
<p>Cairo: An aviation department intelligence agency said that the British Air Force continued to bomb the Italian ground and air forces gathered in Africa. The bombing of a large number of Italian aircraft at Punina in the western desert area destroyed two Italian 79-type three-engine bombers and severely damaged two others. British aircraft also bombed and strafed motor convoys on the road between Midama and Gondar in Italian East Africa. Four bombs hit transport vehicles, and strafing resulted in heavy casualties among enemy soldiers. Italian barracks in Walter Alataba and Midama were also bombed. The large barracks in the southern region of Khenisa was also hit and caught fire in many places. The Danchira barracks, which housed several large units of Italian colonial troops and Blackshirts, was attacked and set on fire at the end of the week, suffering heavy damage. British aircraft flying from Aden in November attacked Italian Eritrea and Abyssinia a total of five times, with the bombing of the port of Asab on the Red Sea being the most intense, with more than thirty attacks. British aircraft attacked the port of Asab for 36 hours. According to reports from pilots and reconnaissance officers, the port was heavily damaged and caught fire in many places. The railway between Addis Ababa and Djibouti was repeatedly bombed by British aircraft, making gasoline in Italian East Africa increasingly scarce. The British aircraft that launched the attacks flew thousands of miles and all safely returned to their original defenses. (3rd day Reuters telegram)</p>
<h3>Germany Stirs Up Trouble in Yugoslavia</h3>
<p>London: A Reuters diplomatic correspondent said that according to recent news from Yugoslavia, Germany is now using its old tricks to stir up trouble in Yugoslavia. Germany is doing this because it has failed to induce the Yugoslav government to join the Axis, as Romania has done. It is generally believed that the bomb that exploded on the doorstep of the residence of Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister Maček was provided by German agents. Some even believe that Germany used Croats to carry out this despicable act. Fortunately, the bomb does not appear to have injured anyone, and the impact of this incident is likely to be the opposite of what the instigators expected. Since Prince Paul, the regent of Yugoslavia, reached an agreement with Maček, there has been a trend towards closer ties between the Croats, Serbs, and Slovenes in Yugoslavia. This explosion may be the starting point of a German action to disrupt the nerves of the Yugoslav people, but its success is unlikely to be better than the Italian invasion of Greece. It is felt that the Greek example has had a resonance in the Balkan Peninsula, which is of great help in defeating the Axis powers' conspiracy. (3rd day Reuters telegram)</p>
<h3>Bulgaria: Strictly Maintaining Neutrality</h3>

<h3>German Submarine Activity off the Coast of Ireland: British Escort Fleet Attacked, Sends SOS; Germans Claim to Have Sunk Over Ten British Ships</h3>
<p>New York: Yesterday, this station received continuous submarine attack signals and SOS signals. It is said that several, or perhaps ten, British and neutral merchant ships off the coast of Ireland were jointly bombed by submarines and aircraft. This shows that in the recent past, Germany's attacks on British shipping have been quite successful. According to intercepted telegrams, six ships claimed to have been hit by torpedoes, two said they had been bombed, and another only said "Rescue quickly," indicating at least three ships are sinking. One of them was the "Lock Ranza," which reported that before being hit by a torpedo, it had rescued sailors from another sunken ship. It is said that the attacks came from all directions and were frequent, indicating that there were quite a few German submarines active. Judging from the SOS signals received, there may have been three escort convoys under attack. Also, because the attack site was less than 400 miles from the Irish coast, British warships and aircraft are believed to have rushed to the rescue. (Third, International News Agency Telegraph)</p>
<p>New York: Mackay Radio reports that twelve ships, mostly British, are currently being torpedoed or bombed by aircraft in the eastern half of the Atlantic, and are now sinking or sending SOS signals. The agency received reports that German submarines fired on the British freighter "Victoria," at 56 degrees 04 minutes North latitude and 13 degrees 30 minutes 0 seconds West longitude. An unidentified ship has also been hit. Among the ships sending SOS signals received by Mackay Radio are the 12,247-ton "Ross," hit by a torpedo at 6:55 AM; the 4,958-ton "Lock Ranza"; the 1,937-ton "Shen Tu," bombed at 10 AM; the "Kilgilan Castle" hit at 7:35 AM; and the 1,641-ton "Victoria" hit at 2:55 AM at night. German dive bombers attacked British ships off Scotland and Ireland, and submarines attacked a convoy 400 miles west of Ireland. Among the ships hit were the "Grande Dame" and the "Goodly," as well as another unidentified ship. (Third, United Press Telegraph)</p>

The aforementioned ship loss figures have become a serious problem, which the British people fully recognize. However, it is believed that once the enemy's attack bases are gradually discovered and destroyed, the situation can be completely changed. (Third, Reuters Telegraph)</p>

<h3>German Air Force Groups Attack Britain: Southampton Suffers Disaster; Fires Still Burning, Everywhere Debris; Bristol Port Bombed Again</h3>
<p>Southampton: Last night, 200 German bombers raided Southampton, encountering strong anti-aircraft fire. Losses included several churches, one theater, several movie theaters, several banks, and many shops and residences. The destruction of the commercial district has left hundreds of unemployed in the city. (Third, United Press Telegraph)</p>
<p>London: An Air Ministry communiqué stated that last night's Nazi air raids were concentrated on Bristol, with few bombs falling elsewhere. The air raid on Bristol began shortly after nightfall and was quite large in scale, only weakening by midnight. Fires broke out in several places, and residences, shops, and public buildings suffered significant damage. There were some casualties among the residents. East Anglia and a few other locations were also bombed, with minor damage and casualties. One British fighter plane was destroyed yesterday, but the pilot escaped safely. (Third, Reuters Telegraph)</p>
<p>London: This area was not raided all night, but this morning, residents had barely woken up when enemy aircraft swooped down from the clouds and dropped nine bombs in a certain area. Three bombs fell on open ground, and the rest fell on the road, causing slight damage to houses on both sides, but no casualties. (Third, Reuters Telegraph)</p>
<p>Southampton: Southampton has become a ruin today after being bombed for eight hours with thousands of highly incendiary bombs. (Information issued by the Air Ministry in London stated that there were approximately 370 deaths and injuries in the Nazi air raids.) Within half a mile along High Street, only broken walls and piles of rubble are visible. The harbor area has also suffered the same disaster. More than ten places in the city have been razed to the ground, trees have been uprooted and broken, and power lines are tangled. Groups of homeless refugees are pouring out of the city. Trucks equipped with loudspeakers are patrolling the city, informing citizens of the aftermath measures. Troops have arrived in the city to assist the police and air defense personnel in maintaining order. Six or seven large churches have been completely destroyed, leaving only a few remaining walls. It is conceivable that incendiary bombs fell like rain on the green grass of the parks. (Third, United Press Telegraph)</p>
<p>Berlin: According to German aircraft returning from reconnaissance over Southampton, the harbor facilities there are still burning. There are three large fires in the southeastern part of the city, and over twenty smaller fires. (Third, Huitong Telegraph)</p>
<p>Berlin: Regarding the bombing of the British port of Southampton by the German Air Force from Sunday night to early Monday morning, Dr. Keller, a German war correspondent who witnessed the event, said that batches of German aircraft continuously dropped all types of bombs on key points in the city. The light from the bombs on the ground was no different from the starlight in the sky. Warehouses, barracks, houses, and factories caught fire one after another, and thick smoke swirled upwards. Anti-aircraft guns on the ground roared in succession, and hundreds of searchlights swept the sky. The explosion of shells in the air was like a grand fireworks display. The flares dropped by German aircraft further enhanced the various lights. Every second there was the sound of bombs exploding, and flames and black smoke followed. We could glimpse the iron skeletons of the factories that had been burned. The riverside docks and the Vickers aircraft motor factory were all engulfed in a sea of fire. The oil pools nearby spewed thick smoke. Below the German aircraft was a true scene of a large city heading towards destruction. (Third, Huitong Telegraph)</p>
<p>Berlin: This morning, German reconnaissance planes flew over Southampton to inspect the results of the German aircraft's attacks the night before. It is said that the thick smoke from the city could be glimpsed from Cherbourg in eastern France. The airspace along the English Channel was also shrouded in black smoke. As Southampton is a gasoline import port, the number of large oil pools and oil depots destroyed by fire must be numerous. It is said that a total of one million tons of gasoline was imported into the UK through the port in 1937. (Third, Huitong Telegraph)</p>
<h3>British Aircraft Fly Over Germany and Italy: Conduct Retaliatory Bombings</h3>
<p>London: The British Air Force has been very successful in attacking German ships and submarines. Another team of British aircraft bombed Italy.

At the same time, coastal command aircraft also set off to bomb German ships off the coast of Norway, directly hitting one of them. A German supply ship north of Bergen was also hit. All British aircraft returned without incident. (Third, Reuters Telegraph)</p>
<p>London: An Italian communiqué broadcast today acknowledged that Naples and Voghera had been bombed by British aircraft, causing large fires. According to German news agency reports, a snowstorm in the Adriatic Sea caused a disaster, and an Italian ship ran aground. There was also a heavy snowstorm in the Black Sea. There was heavy snowfall in Yugoslavia last weekend, and snow accumulated to about five feet in some parts of Albania, causing considerable disruption to air operations.

<h3>Sichuan to New Kang (Xikang) Highway Completed</h3>
<p>Chongqing: The 170-mile highway from Sichuan to New Kang (Xikang) has now been completed, so there will be regular buses and trucks traveling between Chengdu and Dajianlu (Kangding). The road is named the Inner Tibet Highway. 150,000 workers struggled for 30 months against ice, snow, wind, frost, hunger, and hardship, finally completing this branch of China's lifeline. The road is mostly mountainous, so the project was very difficult, often requiring blasting mountains and digging roads to move forward. One section, 30 miles long, is more than 10,000 feet above the ridge of Erlang Mountain, and it took 3,000 workers six months to dig. Many workers died of illness and frostbite.

<h3>Hitler's Gloom</h3>
<p>Noguès, having Gilot's preemptive words, refused to receive these two British special envoys, nor did he allow them to meet with the dignitaries on the Massilia. From the moment they arrived in Casablanca, they were kept under surveillance. They flew back to London in despair. Their mission had failed.</p>
<p>The importance of their mission was something the French could not know. Their failure was truly tragic! The British intelligence had intercepted a secret German telegram, which contained the terms of the German-French armistice, stipulating that the French warships stationed at Oran must be handed over to Germany. Their trip was to inquire about the truth of this telegram.</p>
<p>The British later learned that the telegram was a cunning trick by the Germans. If General Noguès had been willing to receive Gott and Twiggou-Cuber, this trick could have been exposed earlier. Alas, they were turned away in Casablanca, further convincing them of the authenticity of the telegram.</p>
<p>Because of this misunderstanding, the British fleet sailed to Oran on July 3rd and presented the French fleet with an ultimatum, demanding a response within six hours. The French fleet, unwilling to violate the orders of the Pétain government, refused to accept the conditions. The British fleet then opened fire, sinking and damaging several French warships, with hundreds of soldiers killed.</p>
<p>Judging from this incident, the French fleet was completely unprepared for defense and had no intention of leaving Oran. According to French naval officers, they had long been ordered to keep the ships in port and had begun to dismantle the gun positions and engines.</p>
<p>At that time, there was no doubt that the French fleet was fervently pro-British. If the Pétain government had ordered the fleet to be handed over to Germany or Italy, it would have caused a rebellion. If Britain had waited a week or two, the truth would have become clear.</p>
<p>The sinking of the French fleet in Oran was generally hailed as a great British victory. However, the Germans could also boast that it was another German victory. The hope of many French people to continue resisting Germany sank to the bottom of the sea along with the French fleet. General Noguès therefore unhesitatingly re-arrested Mantel and ordered the Massilia to sail to Marseille immediately, allowing no one to stay except Daladier.</p>
<p>Noguès had always respected Daladier and did not want to send him back to France to die. Therefore, he allowed the former prime minister to "seclude himself in the universe" for several weeks. During this "seclusion" period, Daladier's friends also tried their best to help him escape to the United States or South America.</p>
<p>However, Daladier did not want to live as a fugitive. His departure from France was not to save his own life, but to save the life of the nation. At that time, the French National Committee had been established in London under the leadership of military expert General Teger. He felt that there was no other way to save the country except to go to London. Although Teger's talent was respected, he was unknown both domestically and abroad and was not enough to make a broad appeal to the French people. However, Daladier's name was known to all. The French knew very little about Teger's name, so he could not come forward. The French agricultural and commercial circles, although deeply jealous and disgusted with a group of bureaucratic politicians, placed their hopes on Daladier alone. He was called the "moderate Frenchman," possessing all the virtues and faults unique to the French. Daladier was confident that once he rose to lead the French National Committee, he would revitalize the pro-war camp, something Teger could not hope to match.</p>
<p>Although Noguès was very willing to have Daladier go far away, he was unwilling to let him go to London. One day, a Portuguese seaplane landed in Casablanca, preparing to take Daladier away, but because of an order from Noguès, Daladier failed to make the trip.</p>
<p>One day, a Greek freighter agreed to take Daladier, but at the last moment, Daladier suddenly felt that the matter was too dangerous and suddenly changed his mind. Daladier's friends had exhausted their intelligence and strength and could do nothing but write to the British Ambassador to Spain, Sir Hoare, and the Governor of Gibraltar, requesting that a British cruiser be sent to pick him up. However, they waited and waited, but there was no sign of the cruiser.</p>
<p>Daladier's friends said to him: "You can't run to England. Now you should go to America, this is the only remaining chance." But Daladier still insisted as before, refusing to go anywhere other than England. Noguès finally ran out of patience and arrested him one and a half months later.</p>
<p>Although Daladier and his kind failed, it cannot be said that the internal conflict in France has subsided. As the German-British war situation was uncertain, they tried to wipe out all strongly anti-German and pro-British individuals or groups. They also used various propaganda methods to win over the French to support the "New European Order" in the German style.</p>
<p>After Germany defeated the French army this summer, it focused all its efforts on this work, and it is no wonder that it took two months to do so. They also had to take the same measures in the Netherlands, Belgium and other occupied countries, but on a smaller scale and in a slightly different form. The Balkan countries require even more effort from Germany and constant attention. And the Soviet Russian "white bear" cannot be ignored. The Germans have tasted the bitterness of establishing and ruling a vast empire for the first time.</p>
<p>By August 11th, Germany launched an air force blitz against the British Isles. But according to our observations from behind the German front lines, the British air war at this time was still just one part of the war of attrition, and the main battlefield for the German army was still on the European continent.</p>
<p>Within the German front lines, there are no fewer than 100 million non-Germans harboring resentment. Although the leaders of the National Socialist Party know that the people of the occupied countries must be able to endure for the time being, this dissatisfaction is like buried dynamite, with the possibility of exploding anytime, anywhere. To keep them enduring, they must be closely monitored, even using food, work, or personal safety as bait.</p>
<p>What Germany is undertaking is a huge and dangerous task. After painstaking efforts, they have seized a vast Europe with lightning speed, but Germany still lacks the strength to concentrate all its efforts on launching a fatal blow against the British Isles. Germany knows this, and the British know it too. This is why Germany has not yet taken the offensive against Britain.

<h3>Frequent Civil Wars in Various Regions of Romania; German Troops Stationed in Romania Hold a Grand Review; Opposition Politicians Flee One After Another</h3>
<p>Bucharest: The civil unrest in Romania continues unabated. The first major event yesterday was the burning of a large number of official documents in the Propaganda Ministry building. The second major event was King Michael's appearance before the public during the parade of German troops. This was the first time the Romanian King had appeared since the outbreak of terrorist activities. After the parade, King Michael immediately went to his secret hiding place under tight protection. Romanian leader General Antonescu met with army generals during the day. It is said that Antonescu hesitated during the meeting about officially announcing a military dictatorship. It is rumored that if Antonescu takes this step, the Iron Guard will openly declare war. The Iron Guard has requested Archbishop Nicolescu of the Romanian Church to officially declare the deceased founder of the Iron Guard, Corneliu Zelea Codreanu, a saint, but when Nicolescu refused this request, it caused quite a stir among the general public. It is reported that the entire regions of Ploiești, Constanța, and Galați are under the control of terrorists, the majority of whom are Iron Guard members. The fire in the Propaganda Ministry building is believed to have been caused by incendiary bombs, as an explosion occurred in the archives room at the beginning of the fire. Many government officials are said to have advised General Antonescu to order the disarmament of the Iron Guard, but it is reported that Antonescu is still hesitant to take this action. Antonescu apparently feels that the army may not obey an order to confiscate the Iron Guard's weapons. It was also heard that the government has requested the National Church to accept some of the principles put forward by the Iron Guard. The Iron Guard has submitted a memorandum to the religious conference, containing thirty points, requesting the Greek Church to "adapt to the times." (International Telegram, 3rd)</p>
<p>Rome: This morning, the Romanian government issued a statement saying that it recognizes rumors of disturbances occurring within Romania. This move is apparently aimed at rumors about the unstable internal situation in the country.

<p>Bucharest: To celebrate Romania's entry into the Tripartite Pact, German troops stationed in Romania held a military parade in Bucharest at noon yesterday.

On the stand were King Michael, General Antonescu, Iron Guard leader Horia Sima, German Minister to Romania Fabrizius, German military commanders, and other guests. A battalion of the Romanian Army led the reviewed troops, followed by a motorized unit commanded by Lieutenant General Rossky of the German Army Group, then German infantry, artillery, signal corps, engineers, armored vehicles, and anti-aircraft artillery units. At the same time, German air force squadrons were also flying in the air. The most eye-catching among the reviewed troops were the heavy artillery and armored vehicles. The German infantry marching in formal formation were also noteworthy. Although only a portion of the German troops stationed in Romania participated in the review, it took more than an hour to complete the review. (Haitong News Agency Telegram, 3rd)</p>
<p>Bucharest: After the fascist Iron Guard in Romania massacred a large number of politicians, important figures in the opposition political circles feared being targeted and fled the country one after another. For example, former Prime Minister Tatarescu has already crossed the border and fled to Yugoslavia.

The residence of National Peasant Party leader Maniu has been protected by the police to prevent attacks by Iron Guard members. In addition, according to the latest news, the capital of Romania and various provinces have returned to normal. In the past three days, no further accidents have occurred. Rumors that a riot occurred somewhere yesterday are completely unfounded. (Havas News Agency Telegram, 2nd)</p>

<h3>Roosevelt Signs Philippine Constitution Amendment; Quezon's Re-election as Philippine President Seems Promising</h3>
<p>Washington: The White House announced that U.S. President Roosevelt has signed the amendment to the Philippine Constitution. This is the first decision to amend the Philippine Constitution.

This amendment will allow President Quezon to be re-elected and prepare the Philippines for its final independence during the next difficult four years.

<p>Wu Jinglue from Yushan, alias Xiaosheng Qinyunshizhuren, has a deep understanding of ancient music and is extremely proficient in qin studies. He has developed the qin art to the extreme, playing ancient tunes and restoring the original sounds. When he plays, the sound of the qin evokes images of flowing water and towering mountains, like Cheng Lian on the sea, moving people's emotions. At a time when elegant music is declining, reviving this art will undoubtedly benefit the world and people's hearts. Famous figures in Shanghai, such as Shen Enfu, Zhang Yipeng, Pang Yuanji, and Wang Qingmu, feared that the art would be lost and urged him to teach and preserve the ancient music. It is now heard that he has reluctantly agreed to their request and set up a lecture hall at the Jinye School on Baker Road, Daxing Road, so that those who are interested in this art can inquire.</p>

<h3>Second Youth Charity Basketball Match; Guoyou to Play Against McLein's Officers; Still at the Youth Hall This Saturday at 7 PM; Women's Basketball Exhibition Game Before the Match: Youyou vs. Jingwu</h3>
<p>The Sports Department of the Youth Association, in order to raise funds for the Christmas Children's Charity Party, invited top Chinese and Western men's and women's basketball teams to participate in charity basketball games last week. At that time, McLein's officers promised to play another game. Now, Liu Hesheng of the Sports Department of the association has arranged for Guoyou to play against them. The game is scheduled to be held at the same place this Saturday (the 7th) evening. Before the game, the Youyou team will play against Jingwu. The officers' team easily defeated Shanghai Star last week, and their strong fighting power has deeply impressed the general audience. With Henshawitz's outstanding performance, it is even more rare. The Guoyou team was one of the top three in Shanghai the year before last and has players such as Li Zude, Chen Bangzhen, and Bao Songyuan. In the previous challenge match, they lost to Paramount by only one point. They are brave and good at fighting. It can be seen that their skills are still good. This time, they are determined to play against the officers. Wang Nanqun and Gao Baosheng are determined to play and serve their mother team, so the lineup is even more complete. In the women's game, Youyou has top-notch players such as Zhang Pei, Liu Zhenbao, and Huang Mingyuan. Jingwu has Li Yunzhi, Rong Shujian, and Xi Xun. Both sides are evenly matched in strength. They have met twice before in amateur volleyball and the Guangshi Cup opening exhibition game. The two teams each won once and both won by one point. This is the third time they have met, and it is difficult to predict who will win. Tickets are still sold for two yuan and are available for pre-sale at the association's inquiry office from today. The schedule for the two games is as follows: Youyou vs. Jingwu (Women's Exhibition) at 7:00 PM; Guoyou vs. McLein's Officers (Men's Exhibition) at 8:00 PM.</p>
<h3>New Six Cup Top Six Replay: Evening Glow Defeats Hualian; Huayi Jia to Play Xinya Tonight</h3>

The newly formed third-place team, Hualian, played against the runner-up of the sixth group, Evening Glow Jia. Both teams are rising stars with similar strengths. Hualian made a mistake in the lineup arrangement, so Evening Glow broke them one by one and won five points in a row. Hualian only relied on Zhu Shihai to defeat Ding Zhiming of Evening Glow in straight sets to get one point. As a result, Hualian was defeated by Evening Glow Jia by a score of one to six. Tonight at 7:00 PM, Huayi Jia will play against Xinya at the same place. The former won the Zongjing Cup runner-up and has a strong lineup. The latter is a strong team that has emerged as a dark horse and has a complete team of talents. However, Huayi's hope of winning is stronger. Tickets are all priced at 30 cents.</p>

<h3>Guoqiang Middle School Promotes Center Ball Game</h3>
<p>Although the "Goal-hi" novel basketball game, which was popular in the American sports world this summer, was promoted by Mr. Bolato, the director of the Western Youth Sports Department, after returning to Shanghai, very few schools in the city responded. It is learned that Guoqiang Middle School on Aiwenyi Road will be the first to hold an experimental inter-class competition. This interesting, safe, and beneficial new type of exercise is indeed suitable for junior high school students and women. However, the original name "Goal-hi" (transliteration) seems inappropriate for application in China, so the school has temporarily translated it as "Center Ball", which seems more accurate and meaningful, because the goal of the ball is appropriately at the center of the field. The rules of the game are roughly similar to basketball, except that the penalty kick, start of the game, dribbling, hitting, and rotation are slightly different. The area of the court is only half that of an ordinary basketball court (detailed in this newspaper on November 9). Therefore, this sport is extremely suitable for schools with "small courts and many people" on the current isolated island. Even the promotion to families or neighborhoods is extremely needed. The inter-class competition held by the school is divided into ten groups and stipulates that students whose monthly test scores are unqualified are not allowed to participate in order to cultivate the purpose of emphasizing both academics and sports. If schools in the city need the competition rules, they can ask the school's sports director Huang Zhenming or Qian Xucang, who can tell you everything in detail.</p>

<h3>Food: Prices Rise Several Yuan Continuously for Several Days; Rice Will Soon Cost One Yuan per Sheng; People's Food Situation Has Reached an Extremely Critical Stage; Is Just Watching Without Helping Intended to Harm All Living Beings?</h3>
<p>The rice market is in a fever of speculation and is becoming increasingly chaotic. The entry and competitive buying of new hoarding households from outside the industry and the price increases of the consignors seem crazy, and they no longer care about the condemnation of righteousness or general advice. Yesterday, foreign rice rose sharply in the morning and even more so in the evening, increasing by three, four, or five yuan. After the market opened in the morning, rumors became more and more intense, and buying became more and more frenzied. The prices of each grade rose sharply. Saigon No. 1 rose to 84 yuan, and No. 2 rose to 80 yuan and 7 jiao, an increase of two or three yuan compared to the previous day. In the afternoon, off-market trading rose higher and higher. No. 1 was still short of sales at 85 or 86 yuan, and No. 2 Pagoda Brand even reached 83 yuan, which was four or five yuan higher. Since the official announcement of Jardine Matheson's order has not been made, it is said that many orders for Burmese rice have been placed recently, and all are direct transactions. There are few official announcements on the market, so the hoarding is even more unusual. The entire market only has more than 300 tons as a decoration. No. 1 in December is 95 yuan and 5 jiao, and No. 2 in November is 93 yuan, and in December it is 92 yuan, rising to 93 yuan in the afternoon. Spot goods were quoted high but not opened in the afternoon, and less than 20,000 bags were transacted in spot trading due to hoarding. The prices include Saigon No. 1 at 84 yuan and 83 yuan, No. 2 at 80 yuan and 7 jiao and 80 yuan, Fire Twist at 82 yuan and 4 jiao and 80 yuan, No. 2 Weiqi at 78 yuan and 5 jiao and 77 yuan and a half, Small Twist at 77 yuan and a half and 77 yuan and 2 jiao, Tokyo Top at 72 yuan and 2 jiao and 70 yuan, Rice Bran at 70 yuan, Medium at 69 yuan, Broken Special at 69 yuan and 5 jiao, and Secondary at 67 yuan, Wuhu Top at 71 yuan and a half, and Machine Top at 75 yuan and a half.</p>
<p>Since the transportation of new japonica and thin rice domestic rice from the Hongkou district has been blocked for several days, the source has been cut off, and the price has become more unusual, and the price has skyrocketed, increasing by as much as three or four yuan. The prices are now new japonica at 98 yuan per hu, and thin rice in original packages at 98 yuan, and 95 yuan to 93 yuan per hu.</p>
<p>The sales of glutinous rice have been slightly slower, but the stock is insufficient, and the market is tight. Kaiyi Li Special Yuan is 95 yuan, Ordinary is 92 or 3 yuan, Hong Kong White Yuan is 85 or 6 yuan, and Medium is 80 yuan.</p>
<p>Foreign rice arrived in Shanghai again yesterday. The Taikoo Company's Qingyuan Wheel brought 3,745 bags from Hong Kong and arrived at the port yesterday afternoon, docking at the company's wharf in Pudong to unload. The price of rice in the city has reached this point, and 100 yuan per bag of japonica rice is already in sight. Although foreign rice arrives every day, the price of rice is frequently reported to be rising. The people's food situation has reached an extremely critical stage, and is still watching without knowing how to save it intended to harm all living beings? (Ancestor)</p>
<h3>The Increasing Trend of Foreign Flour</h3>
<p>Flour: Yesterday, flour trading still centered on foreign flour. After more than 190,000 bags of Australian fine flour arrived at the end of last month, the market is now widely influenced by foreign flour. Even some of the cheaper flour from Chinese factories is using foreign flour as a substitute, a truly unprecedented situation. Therefore, consumers are paying attention to purchasing foreign flour. Consequently, the current price of the "Flower Bird Clock Tower" brand of foreign flour opened at $19.50 and rose to $19.85. Furthermore, the price of goods arriving at the beginning of this month was $19.60, an increase of 40 to 50 cents compared to the previous day. A total of 12,300 bags were transacted, with local and out-of-town buyers splitting the purchase equally. The wholesale price of Chinese flour remained at $18, with over 8,000 bags sold by two factories.</p>
<p>Wheat: Trading was quiet yesterday, but the market is trending subtly higher. The asking price for goods stored in concessions reached as high as $29. Chinese factories still find this price too high and are unwilling to buy. Japanese factories are still selling at the original price of $27, with slight increases in retail sales. There are still scattered deliveries from factories, two to three hundred bags, all of which are prepaid futures, with agreed prices also around $27.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains: Soybean Oil Prices Are Being Manipulated More Intensely</h3>
<p>As reported in this newspaper the previous day, speculation in rice and silkworm cocoons has spread to miscellaneous grains. Yesterday, this trend became even more active, especially in the oil market, where waves of speculation reached the sky, and the rising trend spread everywhere. Short sellers in the industry have reversed course and gone long, causing the price of raw soybean oil to suddenly increase by a huge $3-4. The soybean market has also been driven up by about one dollar due to such manipulation. A large number of transactions took place in the market, including 300 dan of factory-produced soybean oil, 80 pieces of Yantai soybean oil, 250 pieces of Jiaozhou soybean oil, 700 pieces of raw oil, 50 pieces of Yantai raw oil, 100 cans of Jiangbei new raw oil, 60 barrels of Qingdao raw oil, another 1,000 barrels of the near term, and 600 barrels of forward contracts. There were also 1,000 bags of Qingdao soybeans, 700 bags of Tianjin Jinyuan soybeans, 40 bags of Chongming sand soybeans, and 50 bags of Pudong Doudou soybeans. Inspections show that sales transactions were very few.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Diaoqing Sugar, Long Dormant, Shows Signs of Movement</h3>
<p>Due to the "removal certificate" requirements for domestic sugar, not only has there been no opening for a long time, but the source has also been lacking, making the market extremely quiet. There have been no transactions for more than two months. Yesterday, Jianbang sugar finally started to open with a batch of 110 bags of Gaozhang Diaoqing sugar, priced at $63.50, only about $3 less than in late September, which is still considered stable. There were slight fluctuations in the public market's allocation. Spot prices for No. 24 coarse white sugar remained at $73 at the warehouse. Spot prices for Dutch red sugar were $56.70-56.80, and the 10th-day warehouse order was $57, up 20-30 cents. Taikoo Car White B mark was $76.10, up 30 cents. DY mark East warehouse was $70.20, up 20 cents. HX mark West warehouse initially sold for $70.20, and East warehouse was $70, but later also reached $70.20.</p>
<h3>Dried and Preserved Goods: Large Slices of Dried Longan Increase by $3</h3>
<p>Since the price of large slices of dried longan decreased, merchants have tried to recover more than ten dollars, but the goods arriving at stores have faced extra fees from Xiamen, leading to a stalemate. Also, the number of arrivals is not large. Therefore, the result of maintaining this stalemate is a positive trend. It is said that a few boxes have recently been sold, with an increase of three dollars compared to before.</p>
<h3>Finance: Foreign Exchange Favors Sellers, Atmosphere Increasingly Strong</h3>
<p>The foreign exchange market yesterday showed no changes in HSBC's listed rates. In the gray market for British and American exchange rates, the United States' strong support for China created a strong bearish atmosphere. With people feeling this way, the market loosened, especially with Hong Kong Electric and other companies selling a large amount. However, because Chinese banks were willing to absorb, the loosening trend was slow. It is expected that the future will continue to be long. In the current environment, there are still rumors stimulating people's minds. Some operators are hesitating. At the closing price today, British gold was quoted at 3 pence 765625, and the US exchange rate was $5.9375, an increase of 0.046875 and 0.0625 respectively compared to the previous day.

After the success of the large loan, it did not show any effect, and was indeed affected by the adverse forces of the environment increasing secretly.

Yesterday, several hundred thousand units of Category B were sold, and the market price suddenly decreased. However, if this amount were applied to Category C, it would not have much effect. The future still depends on changes in the environment. Yesterday, Lianhe, Yitai, and Runli consistently sold in the morning and afternoon, with Lianhe selling the most Category B. Shunchang consistently bought in. Others, such as Hongda, Yongkang, Lianyi, Tongkang, Dingkang, and Shengda, all bought in, but the amount was not large. Erhao, Siyihao, and Runde still sold, so the market price was tired and could not rise. Both long and short positions were still maintaining their lines, and the overall strength was evenly matched, awaiting changes. As a result of the day, highs and lows were mixed by 5 cents and 10 cents, but Category B fell the most, by 40 cents. About 1.67 million units were traded. A brief summary is listed below.

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Cotton Yarn Profits Emerge, Double Horse Retracts Slightly by $12</h3>
<p>The yarn market, which had risen sharply the previous day, leveled off slightly yesterday, but the trend remained quiet. The rising trend was somewhat too violent. In general, those who made profits, seeing that the rising force had been set, spit out a little, causing a step back. But in reality, there is no big drop either. Because the factory's costs have increased, and the inventory is decreasing day by day. However, the factory's chips are somewhat more relaxed when encountering a sharp rise, and some are shorting. However, those who have sufficient capital to absorb the transferred goods are still not moving.</p>
<p>Because the popularity was tense in the afternoon of the previous day, the price opened at $1,255 for Double Horse in the morning, and the long positions were still high. As soon as this price opened, some of those who had made profits came out slightly, and the chips were slightly looser, and they saw a drop to $1,242. Then the foreign exchange rate was looser, and the floating long and hat-snatching people were active on the short side, and it continued to drop to $1,237. However, short sellers came to cover their positions at low prices, and it still rebounded to $1,245, and finally closed slightly flat at $1,240. According to the half-day transaction statistics, 6,270 bags were traded, and the price of 20-count Double Horse yarn fell by $12. The amount of purchases from each gang is listed as follows:</p>
<p>Same Trade 6,000 Hong Kong 245</p>
<p>Tianjin 25 Statistics 6,270</p>
<h3>Sources Difficult to Obtain: Cotton Merchants Maintain as Before</h3>
<p>The current cotton situation has turned firm. Because the source is not smooth, Chinese factories have had better intentions recently because of the high price of yarn, and they sometimes purchase, so the price is also upward. The same trade is very fierce in maintaining the price. The price of Tongzhou American cotton is $239, the price of Brazilian cotton is $284, and the price of 火機 cotton is $206.</p>
<p>The market price of foreign cotton: The New York cotton market is firm and lively. The purchase of the same industry and the covering of some short positions resulted in a closing price of 2 pounds higher than the previous day. India has closed the market.</p>
<p>The transaction of foreign cotton in Shanghai has been very quiet recently. Japanese manufacturers made a small purchase yesterday, but it was a small transaction. Chinese manufacturers' willingness to purchase is still very weak.</p>
<h3>Yarn Market in Turbulence</h3>
<p>— Zhong</p>
<p>The yarn market in the last two weeks can be said to have been infinitely variable. Considering its trend, it has finally cycled several times around $1,275 to $1,200. It began with the strong atmosphere of peace between China and Japan. The foreign exchange rate looked long, and the sellers were unusually active. On November 18, the price of Double Horse was $1,275, and it gradually decreased to $1,182 on the 23rd. As the price fell, the selling trend slowed slightly. It is estimated that most of the households with plenty of capital did not shake the multi-amount at the low peak, but instead dragged in, and the dryness of the chips had a significantly rising appearance. However, market discussions were numerous, saying that the huge amount of the Sino-American loan should be established, the position should be widened, and the market should be viewed as small. On November 28, Double Horse saw $1,198 again. Unexpectedly, at the opening on Monday, December 2, due to the announcement of the Sino-American loan, the popular heart was timid, the foreign exchange rate frequently lengthened, and the short positions were especially excited. The yarn market followed and fell. Unexpectedly, in a short while, the foreign exchange rate suddenly changed and contracted, and the current yarn market was stormy, and the buyers seemed to come like bees. The short side was greatly alarmed, and the straight line galloped up, jumping 40 yuan. The peak of Double Horse once reached $1,258. The author explores and adjusts the reasons for the rise in cotton yarn here, and makes a brief reference:</p>
<p>(1) Recently, the Double Horse short side has been unusually active. Because the US side has successfully loaned a large amount, the amount often thrown out exceeds the normal range, so it can't resist the reflection.</p>
<p>(2) The amount absorbed by large households in the same industry is never abandoned. Considering the reason, it is related to the factory's cost, and they are unwilling to sell it off. Moreover, the raw materials cannot be relaxed, and the source is difficult.</p>
<p>(3) The rumors have been extremely intense recently, saying that "a certain bank" will be established, and it is also said that the number of Japanese yarns banned from shipping to Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces has been completely opened. Therefore, the rise in Japanese yarn is stronger. After asking several times, it has not yet arrived when it is fully opened. However, the amount of shipping can be increased by a few percent compared to the past. For example, each unit in Jiangsu Province can ship 500 bags per day, and now it can ship 600 to 700 bags. The multi-party also said that the recent trend is also upward.</p>
<p>(4) Although the need in the southwest has no large-scale development, the purchase of 42-count and 32-count yarns is particularly healthy, and the current price of 20-count yarn is relatively cheap, so there are many who want to increase the price. The fundamental question is whether the actual sales are large or small, and the rise and fall of the yarn market is the first key.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Wenzhou and Taizhou Gangs Active in Handling Cloth</h3>
<p>The trend of factory cloth was stable yesterday, because there is a saying that shipping in Wenzhou has returned to normal. After the passenger gangs shipped out the accumulated goods, new transactions gradually increased, and the demand for fine cloth and bleached cloth was the most frequent. The market gradually showed activity, and the selling price of fine cloth increased by 25 to 35 cents, and the selling price of coarse twill cloth increased by 10 to 25 cents. The price of Yihua Bleaching Factory has increased by 50 cents to 1 yuan across the board, and the price of spring fine yarn thread goods has also increased sharply. More than 1,000 pieces of various goods were traded on this street, and the Guangdong and Hong Kong gangs handled more than 400 pieces of colored cloth, bleached cloth, and coarse and fine cloth. The Zhejiang, Wenzhou, and Taizhou gangs handled more than 200 pieces of bleached and dyed cloth and coarse and fine cloth.</p>
<p>The selling price of the fine cloth of the East cloth leader has fallen back, taking the market price of 35 yuan and 60 cents per piece. The sales of mid-range fine cloth in this street are still strong, so it insists on not moving. The 四君子哔叽 also fell along with the leader because of retail sales, and the closing price was about 1 yuan and 9 cents.</p>
<h3>Hardware: Wire Rod Changes Selling Price Several Times in One Day</h3>
<p>Nails: Previously, because the sales of this nails were blocked, they had temporarily become fatigued. However, since the recent two or three days, because the price of wire rods has risen daily, the cost of this nails has increased, and the asking price must also increase. In addition, there are both inland river merchants and business on this street, and the number of transactions is estimated to be 400 to 500 barrels. The actual sales have changed their old appearance, and people's hearts are naturally good. The asking price is high, and the price of each barrel of 倍司 was 55 yuan yesterday, an increase of 1 yuan.</p>
<p>Wire Rod: Yesterday, wire rod transactions were frequent, no less than 1,000 dan, so the market was strong. The industry's thoughts were strange and high, and the selling price changed several times in one day. The final price was 60 yuan, also an increase of one or two yuan compared to before. It is heard that the market is not lacking in goods, so there is no shortage of raw materials for nail factories, screw factories, and lead wire factories for the time being.</p>

<h3>The West Shanghai Blockade Shows No Sign of Loosening; Delegation Negotiates with the Japanese Side; Police Department and Japanese Military Police Discuss Matters; Hoping Restrictions of the Blockade Can Be Relaxed</h3>
<p>According to the Information Office of the Shanghai Municipal Council, regarding the blockade of the area of the outer roads west of Shanghai, the Police Department has directly negotiated with the Japanese Military Police Headquarters, in order to relax the said blockade. The Municipal Council has also requested the leader of the Consular Body to negotiate to achieve the goal of relaxing the blockade.</p>
<p>The Leader of the Consular Body, Mr. Heale, stated that the Japanese Consul-General Horiuchi's attitude showed friendship and sympathy towards the residents, but in his reply at 2 p.m., he stated that the current restrictions are in place to search for the assassins who attacked the Japanese military police. Before the Japanese authorities deem it impossible to capture the assassins, the blockade cannot be lifted. Furthermore, according to a Japanese police officer assisting in the negotiations, the Japanese side replied that the blockade cannot be lifted for the time being and may continue for another two or three weeks.</p>
<p>Efforts from All Sides to Transport Food</p>
<p>According to the English-language Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury, the Japanese blockade of the "badlands" area west of Shanghai entered its fourth day yesterday (the 3rd) afternoon. The situation is serious. Foreign consuls stationed in Shanghai and police officers from the Shanghai Municipal Council are jointly meeting with the Japanese side to ease the restrictions imposed by the Japanese and allow food to be transported in to aid the countless Chinese residents who have been trapped in the area since Saturday and unable to leave or enter. The Danish Consul-General stationed in Shanghai, who also serves as the Leader of the Consular Body, Mr. Heale, met with the Japanese Consul-General Horiuchi yesterday afternoon. Before that, Mr. Heale had met with representatives from other consulates in order to explain the views of all foreigners when meeting with Horiuchi.</p>
<p>Soldiers with Bayonets Standing Guard as Before</p>
<p>It has been found that the Japanese implemented the blockade after a Japanese military police officer was stabbed on Saturday. Until yesterday morning, the blockaded area extended from Jing'an Temple to Yih Ting Pan Road and from Yu Yuan Road to Great West Road. Japanese soldiers with bayonets patrolled back and forth, preventing Chinese people from entering or leaving, and also prohibiting food from being delivered to the trapped residents. There are rumors that teachers and students from schools in the Western District will be allowed to enter and exit, but this has not been confirmed. However, all foreigners are allowed to pass through the barriers.</p>
<p>The Person Who Fired the Gun Has Likely Left the Country</p>
<p>According to residents of foreign nationality within the blockaded area, there are many inconveniences after the blockade. For example, they must bring their own newspapers and food. The obstruction of Chinese residents is nothing more than a means of extortion. Because the Chinese people can pay a bribe of one or two yuan to the guards, then they can enter and exit. If the person who fired the gun and attacked the Japanese soldier had one or two yuan, he would have left the blockaded area long ago.</p>
<p>Difficulties Reduced for British and American Nationals</p>
<p>At the same time, it is heard that the American Consulate has taken direct steps to ensure the interests of American nationals. An official from the American Consulate met with the Japanese Consulate side the day before yesterday. The Japanese side told them that American nationals would not encounter difficulties. It is also heard that the Shanghai Telephone Company delivered food and bedding for 85 Chinese and foreign employees of the Rue Siao-E-Tsan branch in the Western District the day before yesterday, and the Yun Fei Motor Company delivered daily necessities for employees of the branch station in the Western District. They were only allowed into the blockaded area after negotiations by American officials. Female employees of the Rue Siao-E-Tsan Telephone Branch have been trapped and working continuously since Saturday, with only four hours of sleep in sixty hours. It was not until yesterday morning that another group of female employees took over the shift and they were able to return home to rest. Furthermore, officials from the British Consulate stated that British nationals within the blockaded area had "one or two kinds of difficulties," which had been resolved after discussions with the Japanese side.</p>
<p>It Is Said One Can Pass After Paying a Bribe</p>
<p>The North-China Daily News reported that the Japanese military authorities blockaded the area of Great West Road and Yu Yuan Road because a Japanese military police officer was stabbed, and the blockade has not been lifted. Although the Japanese side has taken strict measures, prohibiting anyone from entering or leaving, it is heard that yesterday (the 2nd), some Chinese people crossed the blockade line and entered the Public Concession. It is said that they were allowed to leave the area after paying a bribe. Furthermore, according to well-informed sources, within minutes after the Japanese military police officer was stabbed at the entrance of Lane 52 on Great West Road, the Japanese side captured more than fifteen suspects near the lane, including a Russian who was wearing work clothes.</p>
<p>A Narrow, Dirty Lane Given a One-Time Exemption</p>
<p>The Japanese side has been implementing a blockade in the outer roads area west of Shanghai, prohibiting Chinese people from entering or leaving, for more than sixty hours. Yesterday, a lane was opened between Yu Yuan Road and Great Sifang Road, allowing people to enter and exit. The lane starts from Lane 668 on Yu Yuan Road, passes through a winding, dirty alley filled with garbage, and reaches Great Sifang Road. The sudden implementation of the blockade by the Japanese side has not only affected Chinese people, but also foreigners. It is heard that not a few foreigners in the area have not received milk and bread in the past two days, and there are patients who cannot get medical treatment.</p>
<p>West Shanghai Electrical Wire was Cut and Stolen Again</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, sixty yards of electrical wire in the Western District were cut and stolen, so the electricity in the area was cut off for one and a half hours. Personnel from the power company said they did not know who stole the electrical wire. As for nightclubs and other establishments in West Shanghai, although they are west of the blockaded area, customers can go there via Great Sifang Road and other routes, so business has not declined.</p>
<p>Rice Prices Are Alarming</p>
<p>Shops in the blockaded area have all been closed since the incident occurred, and have not yet reopened. All large and small gambling dens have also been closed. The area is now as silent as a dead city. Food prices have risen to several times their original price. According to residents who have just left the area, the price of rice in the area has risen to 160 yuan per picul, and there is still the suffering of having money but not being able to buy rice. The prices of other various foods and drinks have also risen several times, and residents are in danger of starvation.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Soldier Who Was Shot Has Already Died</h3>
<p>The English-language Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury reports that the Japanese military police officer Sasaki, who was shot by an assassin near Lane 52 on Great West Road at 2:20 p.m. on Saturday, was first sent to the Hong En Hospital for treatment, and then transferred to Hongkou. He died of his injuries en route. After the Japanese military police officer was attacked, he was taken to the Hong En Hospital by a Westerner named White. Dr. Nance, a famous American doctor, immediately treated him. According to Dr. Nance, if surgery had been performed at that time, the life of the Japanese soldier could have been saved. However, before he could perform the surgery, the Japanese military authorities arrived at the hospital and ordered the wounded Japanese soldier to be immediately transferred to a certain hospital in Hongkou, which resulted in him dying en route. According to reports, Sasaki was patrolling Great West Road with two other Japanese military police officers at noon on Saturday when he was attacked. The assassin immediately escaped, and the Japanese side then implemented the blockade in the area.</p>
<h3>Six Young School Children Encounter a Tragic Fate; Sleeping on Wooden Benches at Night, Sustaining Themselves on Biscuits; The Situation Inside the Blockaded Area is Unimaginable</h3>
<p>The English-language Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury reported that six students from the Shanghai Municipal Council Chinese Children's Public School on Yih Ting Pan Road in the Japanese military police blockaded area, ranging in age from six to ten, have been trapped inside the school and have lost contact with their parents for three days and nights. To this day, they are still sustaining themselves on biscuits and cannot return home. The six Chinese children left the school later than usual on Saturday afternoon and happened to encounter the sudden implementation of the blockade by the Japanese side, and were trapped in the school with five teachers. At night, they slept on wooden benches in the classroom, with only three or four blankets to keep them warm, because the Chinese Children's Public School does not have boarding facilities. According to reports, in addition to the Chinese Children's Public School, there are also the Municipal Council Elementary School and Middle School at No. 65 Great West Road, which are also blocked off.</p>
<p>A Maid Bitterly Laments the Suffering of Her Two Children</p>
<p>According to a Chinese maid, her husband has abandoned her and she is supporting five children. She lives in the blockaded area west of Shanghai and works as a maid for a foreign family in the French Concession. Since Saturday, she has been unable to cross the blockade line to return home, and has been staying at her employer's residence in the French Concession. The woman guesses that her three children are not trapped in the blockaded area and must be staying at a friend's house, but she has not been able to meet those three children. Her other two children, the youngest, are left alone at home in the blockaded area, without any food to eat. The suffering of these two children is unimaginable, so the woman is extremely anxious, but there is nothing she can do. There must be more than just this woman among the Chinese residents in the blockaded area who have encountered this tragic situation.</p>
<h3>Chinese Police Officers Request Improved Treatment; Terms Proposed Yesterday; To Be Submitted to the Authorities by Deputy Chief Yao; To Be Discussed and Decided Upon by the Board of Directors After It Is Convened</h3>
<p>All Chinese police officers in the Public Concession, in order to request improved treatment, have appointed representatives to draft the terms to be submitted to the authorities. However, for the sake of caution, they were re-discussed and solemnly revised the day before yesterday. They have now formulated five main terms and fifteen supplementary terms. The terms have now been written in the format of a memorial and were officially submitted to the Chinese Deputy Chief of Police, Mr. Yao Tseng-mo, by the Chinese police representatives yesterday afternoon. Today, they should be received by Major Bowman, the Superintendent. After a preliminary consideration of the contents of the terms, he will forward them to the Director-General, Mr. Fessenden, and propose that they be discussed and decided upon at the Board of Directors meeting to be convened in the coming days. The authorities are very understanding of the Chinese police officers' request for improved treatment due to the pressure of life, and are willing to resolve it as soon as possible in order to reduce the suffering of the Chinese police officers' lives. The Chinese police officers, on the other hand, are working with peace of mind and waiting for a reply. With mutual sincerity between the two parties, this dispute should not be difficult to resolve satisfactorily in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>Waiting Quietly for a Reply</p>
<p>All the representatives of the Chinese police officers deeply understand the overall situation, so all actions are carried out cautiously. Yesterday, after submitting the request to the authorities, they specially printed a notice to all the Chinese police officers and posted it in various police stations within the Concession. The original text is as follows: "It has been found that the reason for the occurrence of dereliction of duty is purely due to the high pressure of life. Fortunately, all colleagues are able to deeply understand the righteousness and take care of the overall situation, and are unwilling to disregard the safety of millions of citizens, so they have been able to obtain the infinite sympathy of all sectors of society. After the representatives appointed by the various police stations participated in the "Provisional Representative Committee," they jointly discussed the necessary conditions for improving life. After several deliberations, it was resolved and passed at 6 p.m. on the 2nd of this month that in addition to drafting the articles and submitting a request to the Police Department to be forwarded to the Engineering Board for approval and implementation, we deeply hope that our colleagues will follow the original intention and live up to the expectations of the citizens, and wait quietly for a reply. A reasonable solution should not be difficult to achieve. This is to inform everyone, the Chinese Police Provisional Representative Committee, December 3rd."</p>
<p>Not Difficult to Solve</p>
<p>The reporter from the Ta Chung News Agency revisited Mr. Yu Qiaqing, a Chinese Director, yesterday to inquire about the development of this issue. Mr. Yu expressed great optimism, saying that because the Chinese police officers are understanding of the difficult times and deeply understand the righteousness, and have agreed not to make other demands in addition to requesting improved treatment, the problem has become simplified. It is expected that the memorial from the Chinese police officers will be submitted to Superintendent Bowman of the Police Department tomorrow (i.e., today) and will be quickly considered. It should not be difficult to obtain a reasonable solution in a short period of time.</p>
<h3>Excellent Results in the Winter Clothing Donation Campaign; Commendation from the General Association; Although It Has Ended, Donations Are Still Being Paid</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Branch of the National Winter Clothing Donation Committee, after being ordered to collect winter clothing donations starting from August 1st, originally set the amount of winter clothing donations to be collected in Shanghai at 500,000 national currency. Through the efforts of all sectors of society, the collection has been quite successful, and the total amount has exceeded the predetermined goal. It has now ended at the end of November. Donations were extremely enthusiastic. The amount of money donated by various industries totaled 500,000 yuan. For example, a certain industry alone recognized a donation of 100,000 yuan. As for the money donated by the cultural, educational, and industrial sectors, as well as individuals, it totaled 400,000 to 500,000 yuan. The total amount donated by Shanghai is close to one million. Although it has now reached the end of the period, various sectors of society are still entrusting banks to remit winter clothing donations to Chongqing. It is heard that the General Association highly commended the enthusiastic donations of the citizens of Shanghai, an isolated island, and has telegraphed Shanghai to commend the donors separately.</p>
<h3>Bean and Rice Industry Association Urgently Restricts Rice Prices; Authorities Instruct Rice Merchants to Order in Rotation; 100,000 Bags to Be Regularly Prepared to Meet Market Demand at Production Prices</h3>
<p>Mr. Ho Te-kuei, Deputy Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council, invited three rice industry leaders, Mr. Chen Tzu-yi, Mr. Chu Tzu-hsiang, and Mr. Fu Chien-keng, the other day to discuss concrete measures. In addition to inquiring about the rice market situation, Mr. Ho will immediately instruct the rice merchants to expand their orders of 100,000 bags of rice at the production price to supply the market, and to order in rotation, so as to prevent the reduction of spot goods on the market. All the representatives recognized that this measure was the most urgent and promised to inform their colleagues to act accordingly.</p>
<p>Scheduled Consultation</p>
<p>In order to actively stabilize the entire food supply in Shanghai, it is heard that the two authorities have scheduled a joint meeting on the 10th of this month (Tuesday) at the Municipal Council on Jiangxi Road to convene rice industry leaders. Mr. Yu Qiaqing will be invited to attend. It is expected that the results of the meeting will lead to a formal decision on concrete measures to stabilize the entire food supply in Shanghai. At that time, Mr. Yu Qiaqing's suggestion to order foreign rice on a large scale will also be discussed at length. In order to stabilize the food supply in Shanghai, it depends on the two concession authorities to lead the way without fear of difficulties, as well as the joint cooperation of all sectors of society. Now that the authorities have this intention, it is expected that the panic over the food supply in Shanghai can be easily resolved.</p>
<p>Mr. Yu's Proposal</p>
<p>Regarding the food supply issue, due to the manipulation of unscrupulous merchants who hoard and speculate, rice prices rose sharply again yesterday by two yuan, breaking new records, and the situation is serious. However, according to Mr. Yu Qiaqing, citizens really do not need to panic, because Shanghai has 700,000 bags of rice in stock, which is more than enough to supply until February of next year. What Shanghai needs most at present is No. 2 Saigon, and the source has not been cut off. Furthermore, new Vietnamese rice can be put on the market at the end of December and the beginning of January. At that time, if the authorities can accept my request, invite all sectors of society, such as the banking, finance, vegetable, and news industries, to order foreign rice at the lowest price and the smallest commission, and store 200,000 bags for public sale, then no one will be able to manipulate, hoard, or speculate for profit, except for a reasonable profit. Then the food supply issue, I dare say, can be resolved once and for all. I hope that all sectors of society will promote and support this. My written proposal to the Municipal Council should be issued tomorrow (i.e., today).</p>
<p>Rice and Grain Meeting</p>
<p>The Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Association and the Miscellaneous Grain and Oil Cake Industry Association, in view of the frequent rise in rice prices, which is not only related to the livelihood of ordinary people, but also will hinder social security, in addition to the Bean and Rice Industry Association having convened an emergency meeting the other day, announcing that the rice market would strictly prohibit illegal transactions, the general rice speculators are still superficially obedient but secretly resistant, and the effect is very small. The market price increase has not subsided. It is now learned that in order to discuss concrete measures to stabilize the entire rice market, the above-mentioned two industry associations have scheduled a joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees of the two industry associations at 3 p.m. today at No. 15 Edinburgh Road, 3rd floor. All members are requested to attend and discuss on time.</p>
<p>Emergency Price Limit</p>
<p>The Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Association continued to issue the first emergency announcement yesterday, saying: "For the emergency announcement, it has been found that rice prices have continued to rise recently without limit, which greatly affects the livelihood and security of the people, which is of great concern. In addition to announcing to the market on the 1st of this month to warn colleagues to abide by the market trading rules, in view of the increasingly serious situation, in order to make emergency arrangements, from the 4th of this month, all rice prices are absolutely not allowed to exceed the closing price on the morning of the 3rd of this month. It is hoped that all parties involved in buying and selling will strictly abide by this and not deliberately violate it, so as not to cause inconvenience. If there are any incidents of dark market price increases, the authorities will be notified and severely punished, and there will be no leniency. This is hereby announced." It has been found that the rice price limit has been raised again and again, and yesterday's closing price reached the highest peak in history. Although it is now limited not to exceed this, even according to this price limit, most merchants and people in Shanghai will find it difficult to bear. If there are any more rumors, troubles, or forced price increases, then the future will be fraught with danger. Fortunately, the authorities attach importance to this.</p>

<h3>Relief Association Sends Letters to Various Industries; Begging to Continue Relief Donations for Another Year; The Cost of Sustenance Has Increased Fivefold Compared to Before; Maintaining the Original Donations to Implement the Original Intention of Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association sent letters to various industries yesterday, requesting that the original donations of various kinds be continued for another year, in order to implement the original intention of disaster relief. The original letter said: "Since the Association has been handling refugee relief, we have been blessed by the enthusiastic donations from various industries, either by recognizing salary deductions, or by recognizing business deductions, and regular assistance, so that tens of thousands of disaster victims have been able to avoid hunger and cold. We admire your great virtues and are grateful beyond measure. However, since the outbreak of the European War, the sustenance of our refugees has increased several times, the source of donations is limited, and the skyrocketing prices are endless. The difficulty of coping with this is beyond what paper and ink can describe."</p>
<p>Although the Number of People Has Decreased, Sustenance Has Increased Instead</p>
<p>"Although the number of refugees has now decreased to more than 16,000, the cost of sustenance for each person per month is more than ten yuan, which is five times more than the previous two yuan per person per month. It is still not enough to maintain this without large donations. Now, the national crisis has not ended, and the great calamity is still deep. If all the refugees are dismissed, not only will the original purpose of relief be lost, but these more than 10,000 refugees are all weak and disabled, and there is smoke everywhere, so where can they go? Since recently, the Association has been actively soliciting donations from all parties in order to continue relief. This is truly the trend of the times, and we cannot bear to abandon the work of nine仞 at the last minute. Your Association has embraced a broad vision and has always been generous. At this critical time, we sincerely beg you to continue the original refugee donations for another year, so that it may be completed from beginning to end. We will be grateful beyond words."</p>
<p>Those Receiving Winter Clothes Must Register First</p>
<p>This year's winter relief has attracted the attention of people from all walks of life. Various charities are also preparing early, such as the shelter that is being built. Once it is opened for accommodation, all those who are displaced and have nowhere to go will be allowed to register and receive cotton clothes. In order to avoid repeated collection of cotton clothes this year, the distribution will be centralized and registration will be carried out first. A "heart" symbol will be stamped on the arms, men on the left and women on the right. This symbol will take one or two months to fade completely, but it is usually covered by the sleeves and cannot be seen by others. However, the distributors can use this symbol to verify whether they have been collected or not.</p>
<p>Rectifying Porridge Relief and Distributing it Widely</p>
<p>Since the Chinese Jisheng Society started to use porridge tickets to distribute porridge to the poor, it has been very effective. The beggars are also happy to get this porridge ticket. However, it was recently discovered that the Dagou Bridge Teahouse and Porridge Shop was buying 30 porridge tickets from beggars. After learning of this, the Jisheng Society specially summoned all the porridge shops to admonish them and removed the porridge shop that bought the tickets from the list (i.e., it will no longer be printed on the porridge tickets in the future). Furthermore, each porridge shop was asked to find a guarantor to guarantee that there would be no incident of buying and selling porridge tickets. It is heard that more than half of the 30 porridge shops have submitted their guarantees to the Jisheng Society. After this rectification, the number of porridge shops has been expanded, and the porridge relief has become more widespread and more effective. In addition, there are others who have stepped forward to handle the matter, such as the Buddhist Brotherhood, and the Nuonajingshe, which is also planning a large number of porridge tickets, in order to benefit the poor.</p>
<p>A Charity Sewing Event Will Be Held Today to Sew Winter Clothes</p>
<p>The Shanghai YMCA has been collecting winter clothes for orphans. Recently, it has received hundreds of sets of new and old clothes from charitable people from all walks of life, and has raised more than 6,000 yuan in cash to purchase cloth, cotton, and lining. It is scheduled to hold a voluntary sewing event starting at 3 p.m. today in the Xue Geng Tang on the second floor of the YMCA at Ba Xian Qiao. At that time, China Underwear Company will donate technicians to go to the event and cut the fabric with sewing machines, and Shengjia Company will donate sewing machines. Many socialites are participating enthusiastically. The YMCA's work is divided into four parts: (1) sewing machine, (2) quilting, (3) hand stitching, and (4) attaching straps, in order to quickly make the clothes. In addition, for the sake of convenience, ladies from all walks of life are also invited to sew on a voluntary basis. There are also three methods: (1) come to the association to sew, (2) take the sewing home, and (3) pay for sewing, with a wage of five cents per piece. It is heard that the cost of each piece of labor is three yuan in national currency. At present, the donations can only make more than 2,000 pieces of winter clothing, which is limited. Winter is approaching in an instant, and it is feared that it will be difficult to distribute them. The Association has now continued to solicit donations widely from enthusiastic people from all walks of life and members of the Association. It is deeply hoped that everyone will do their best to donate money and effort in large quantities to benefit the disaster victims.</p>
<h3>Southeast United Transportation</h3>
<p>Appoints Xiao Wei as Director; Factories and Warehouses to Be Set Up in Various Regions</p>
<p>In order to reorganize the national transportation industry, establish a transportation network to facilitate the travel of public and private merchants, and to strengthen its strength, the Ministry of Communications has stipulated that the country should be divided into three united transportation systems: Southeast, Southwest, and Northwest, and each system should set up a united transportation office to be responsible for its affairs. Now, the various offices have been arranged one after another. Regarding the Director of the Southeast United Transportation Office, Xiao Weiguo, the former Chief of the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Transport Offices, has been appointed and has started working on the 1st of this month. In addition to handling joint freight transportation, he also manages passenger transportation. The office includes the provinces of Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hunan, Guangdong, Fujian, Guangxi, and Guizhou. A total of eight offices are set up.

After the full railway joint transportation, not only can the journey and time be shortened, as well as all waste, but it also truly makes it convenient for the public and private. It is heard that each office will also set up a repair factory and warehouse to provide services.</p>
<h3>Four Workers from the French Concession Tram Company Were Arrested Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Driver Was Beaten</p>
<p>It is said that a tram of a certain number under the French Concession Tram Company was suddenly beaten by several workers from the company. The reason why the driver was beaten is said to be that the driver did not participate in the strike before the tram started during the general strike. The striking workers took him away, and he was only released after the strike was resolved. Before the driver was beaten, he was also ridiculed by some workers who took the opposite stance from him, which led to a fight due to the verbal dispute. Afterwards, the French police sent personnel to arrest the four workers who caused the trouble. Since the four workers were arrested, there was once a commotion among the workers, but it was quickly quelled, which led outsiders to believe that there was a possibility of another labor unrest. However, as of now, no incident has occurred. However, the labor side is scheduled to send representatives to visit Mr. Fevrier, the supervisor, yesterday afternoon, requesting that the arrested workers be released.</p>

<h3>Chinese Seamen in the United Kingdom Strengthen Solidarity</h3>
<p>Liaison with the Transport Workers' Federation; Increase Wages and Marine Insurance Rates</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the European War, many Chinese seamen and ship workers who have served on ships of various countries such as the United Kingdom, Germany, and France have been unemployed due to the war and have returned to China by ship. Recently, five Chinese seamen and ship workers who previously served on British mail ships transferred to the United States and took the American freighter S.S. Snusaa back to China and arrived in Shanghai. They were originally serving on the British ship "Glenlyon" as sailors and servants. After the war, the ship was forced to stop sailing and they were unemployed, so they took a ship back to China. It is also learned that in order to strengthen solidarity, Chinese seamen and ship workers in the United Kingdom have now organized a Chinese Seamen's Union, which is in contact with the International Transport Workers' Federation to increase Chinese workers' wages and marine insurance. Mr. W. J. Chen, the head of the union, has now negotiated with ship owners in the Allied countries. In the future, the lives of Chinese seamen and ship workers serving on merchant ships in various European countries will be guaranteed.</p>

Therefore, all seven hundred employees are currently serving as usual.</p>
<h3>Demise of Modern Buddhist Master, Yin Guang</h3>
<p>Profound Knowledge of Buddhism, Universally Respected</p>
<p>Master Yin Guang was a great master in modern Chinese Buddhism. In his early years, he lived in the Sutra Depository for several years, reading all the Tripitaka scriptures, so his knowledge of Buddhism was profound and he was revered by his generation. He devoted himself to the Pure Land sect and his determination became even firmer. He also used this to persuade others. He wrote "Yin Guang Master's Essays" and the "Jia Yan Manuscript", which are respected by Buddhist practitioners and also recited by scholars. In his later years, he retired to Lingyan Temple in Suzhou. All Buddhist figures would seek his correction on their writings. He was already eighty years old this year. According to legend, he fell down the day before yesterday, after which Master Yin Guang bathed and changed his clothes, chanted the Buddha's name, and after several hours, passed away peacefully at the hour of mao (5-7 AM) on December 2nd. Some say that Master Yin Guang's scholarship and conduct were second only to Master Lianchi in the Ming Dynasty.</p>

<h3>Japanese Warship Shells Chuanshan</h3>
<p>According to a report from the Datong News Agency, a Japanese warship sailing from the northeast shelled the coast of Chuanshan near Zhenhai more than ten times. It left at 2:25 PM. Afterwards, a warship sailed in and had not left as of last night. Two Japanese warships are also docked in the waters off Zhenhai Ligang, but there have been no unusual movements. The Japanese troops who landed in Ligang have not yet withdrawn. According to news from the shipping industry, on the 26th of last month, a Japanese warship off the coast of Shipu lowered a motorboat and chased sailboats. Afterwards, it sailed into Shipu Port and attempted to land. When the garrison stationed there fired, the Japanese boat, unable to withstand it, fled. Shortly afterwards, it suddenly fired four shots towards the coast, the shells falling into the mud, causing no damage. One Japanese warship is still docked in the waters off Shipu, with no unusual movements.</p>
<h3>Construction Begins on Beggar Asylum Buildings, Total Capacity of 2,400 People, Expenses Rely Entirely on Charitable Donations from All Sectors</h3>
<p>The beggar asylum initiated and established by the Public Works Department of the Public Concession has begun construction. When the reporter visited Hart Road (now Changde Road) and Singapore Road (now Yanan East Road) yesterday, he saw that three of the twenty-four asylum buildings planned to be built there had already been erected with scaffolding. According to the Salvation Army's plan, each room will have ten beds, divided into two rows, with five beds in each row. Each bed can accommodate ten beggars, for a total capacity of 2,400 people. The asylum's rooms will have ample air and light, and each room will be equipped with ten glass windows.</p>
<p>All Buildings to be Completed Within the Year</p>
<p>The Public Works Department has been considering the establishment of a beggar asylum since last year, and it was not until the taxpayers' meeting held at the racecourse that it was publicly announced. This plan has now begun to be implemented this winter. However, the construction project may not be completed within the year. However, it is generally hoped that some of the buildings will be completed around Christmas, allowing beggars to live inside.</p>
<p>Education and Nurturing Combined to Enable Self-Reliance</p>
<p>According to the Public Works Department's announcement last time, it pointed out that the Bureau's established policy is that ordinary municipal tax revenues cannot be used for the purpose of relieving beggars. Therefore, the funding for the beggar asylum must rely on private charitable donations, and a portion will be taken from the entertainment donations from refugees within the concession. According to the current plan, all street beggars in the Public Concession will be sent to the asylum, provided with food, clothing, and shelter, and given appropriate education by the asylum staff. It is said that the ultimate goal of the entire plan is to enable beggars to have the ability to be economically self-reliant. Therefore, this plan is not a permanent solution to relieve beggars, but to gradually reduce the number of beggars in the Public Concession.</p>

<h3>Hartung-Chu Chieh-jen Land Rent Lawsuit, Dispute Over Black Market Exchange Rate, Difference Reaches About 400,000 National Currency, Supreme Court Should Have a Fair Judgment</h3>
<p>More than 60 commercial and residential buildings, including Yile Mansion and Tongyuchun along Nanjing Road, are all owned by Chu Chieh-jen of Wuxian County (29 years old this year, residing at 73 Lane 6, Mei Paike Road), but are built on leased land. The land originally belonged to Mr. Scher Bilby of the Fair Bank. In March of the fifth year of the Republic of China, Chu's late father leased it from the Fair Bank, signing a 25-year long-term lease contract. The rent was paid in four installments per year, namely January 1st, April 1st, July 1st, and October 1st. Each installment (three months per installment) was 1,100 British pounds. The contract also stated that the rent would be paid in Chinese currency converted according to the</p>
<p>London Foreign Exchange</p>
<p>rate on the date of payment. Upon the expiration of the lease, the buildings would belong to the landlord. After the lease was signed, both parties fulfilled it for many years without any disagreement. Until the fourteenth year of the Republic of China, the land was bought by Li Sui Hartung (i.e., the wife of the British Jewish Hartung, originally a Chinese woman. After marrying Hartung, she became a British citizen. She is 875 years old this year and is currently the owner of Hartung Garden and Hartung Foreign Firm at 221 Nanjing Road). Chu Chieh-jen then inherited his father's fulfillment of the lease. Initially, there was no dispute with Li Sui Hartung. Until the end of the 26th year of the Republic of China, Chu believed that the rent he paid was within 17,000 National Currency per installment, although he lost one or two hundred yuan compared to the</p>
<p>Central Bank</p>
<p>listing rate of one shilling and two and a half pence per pound, he thought it was the agent's commission and had no objection. However, in the 27th year of the Republic of China, the bills from Li Sui Hartung for the first, second, and third installments increased. The first installment was 18,526.32 yuan, the second installment was 19,555.56 yuan, and the third installment was 29,746.42 yuan. Chu believed that Li Sui Hartung was using the black market exchange rate to implement a disguised rent increase, so he strongly opposed it. Therefore, Li Sui Hartung filed a lawsuit in the civil court of the First Special District Court that year, requesting the court to order the defendant Chu Chieh-jen to pay</p>
<p>three installments of rent</p>
<p>3,300 pounds according to the exchange rate listed by HSBC Bank. However, the original lease contract only stated that it would be converted into Chinese currency according to the London foreign exchange rate on the date of payment, and there was no provision to use the HSBC Bank exchange rate as the standard. Therefore, he requested that the plaintiff's lawsuit be dismissed. The first instance of the case ruled against Chu Chieh-jen. The appeal to the High Second Branch also resulted in a loss. Chu refused to accept it and appealed to the Shanghai Special District Branch of the Supreme Court. After review by the Supreme Branch, it was deemed that the original judgment was inappropriate and was sent back for retrial. The points of instruction stated that although the original judgment believed that there was only the HSBC exchange rate at the time of the signing of the contract, so the foreign exchange rate mentioned in the contract referred to the</p>
<p>HSBC Exchange Rate</p>
<p>and that whether HSBC would continue to exist in the long term of the contract and whether its listed foreign exchange rate would be suspended were all unnecessary to worry about. If so, then why did the parties not clearly specify the HSBC exchange rate as the standard? Since it was a long-term lease, then the common sense question of whether HSBC Bank would continue to exist for a long time and whether its foreign exchange rate would be suspended must have been considered. The original judgment said that such concerns were unnecessary. On what basis did it obtain this conviction? (2) Even if the parties had always converted according to the HSBC exchange rate, but the HSBC exchange rate is vastly different now, it should also be investigated whether there was an agreement between the parties to always follow the HSBC exchange rate regardless of the difference. Regarding the</p>
<p>Exchange Rate Issue</p>
<p>the Ministry of Finance's telegram should also be noted. The High Second Branch's retrial of the case, according to the order, still ruled against Chu Chieh-jen. The reason was that converting into Chinese currency according to the London foreign exchange rate meant using the market price of buying British pounds in Chinese currency. The exchange rate listed by HSBC Bank was the market price. Chu still refused to accept the judgment and hired lawyers Liu Chongyou, Li Wenjie, He Shimai, Wang Jian'e, and Zhou Kun to file an appeal with the Supreme Branch. The reasons stated that the bills given to the appellant by the appellee, Li Sui Hartung, only stated that it was converted into</p>
<p>Chinese Currency</p>
<p>according to several shillings and pence, and there was no mention of the HSBC exchange rate. Now they suddenly distort the meaning of the lease and actually use the black market as the legal price. The lease does not contain the words "market price" or "HSBC". The retrial court did not investigate further and actually approved the appellee's request, which is absolutely unacceptable. According to the Ministry of Finance's Yu Xian Hui Zi No. 1548, the exchange rate listed by the Central Bank should be used as the standard. According to the Ministry of Judicial Administration's order Xun Zi No. 2357, if the parties' contract states that payment is to be made in legal tender converted into foreign currency, the exchange rate stipulated by the national bank shall prevail. Then the appellant's</p>
<p>request based on the lease</p>
<p>is to use the Central Bank's exchange rate to convert the London foreign exchange rate, which is in accordance with laws and regulations. Furthermore, the meaning of foreign exchange rate is the exchange rate between two countries' currencies, that is, the scale of exchanging British pounds for Chinese currency is used for conversion. This is completely different from the so-called market price of buying British pounds in Chinese currency. If this is the meaning, then why didn't it state payment in British pounds and instead stated the foreign exchange rate? It is obvious that the retrial court's judgment was illegal. Since Chu Chieh-jen's appeal, he has supplemented the appeal six times. The Supreme Branch is still carefully studying the case because it is related to</p>
<p>National Legal Rights</p>
<p>and economic status. Regarding the two installments of rent for October 27th and January 28th, Li Sui Hartung had already filed the same lawsuit with the First Special District Court in January of last year. The result was that both the first and second instances were also won. Chu Chieh-jen also appealed to the Supreme Branch. Recently, Li Sui Hartung again filed a lawsuit against Chu for payment of six installments of rent from April 1st of the 28th year of the Republic of China to July 1st of this year, totaling 6,600 British pounds. The case has been studied several times by Li Hu, the Chief Justice of the Civil Court of the First Special District Court. On the 27th of last month, a judgment was announced. Chu Chieh-jen should pay Li Sui Hartung 6,600 pounds of rent according to the HSBC Bank exchange rate on a periodic basis. Chu</p>
<p>refused to accept the judgment</p>
<p>and has now hired lawyer Wang Jian'e to file an appeal with the High Second Branch. The above three cases are actually one case. The lawsuit has been going on for years and has not been resolved. The victory or defeat of both parties depends on the decision of the Supreme Branch. In this rent lawsuit, the difference between the Central Bank's exchange rate and the HSBC Bank exchange rate is very large. According to the Central Bank's exchange rate, each installment of rent is more than 17,000 yuan. If calculated according to the HSBC Bank exchange rate, the latest installment (i.e., October 1st) of rent has reached 76,800 yuan in national currency. The difference over two years amounts to 400,000 yuan in national currency. The case concerns Chinese-foreign debt and is of great importance. The Supreme Branch should have a fair judgment.</p>
<h3>Fabric Consignment, Devoured in Full, Resulting in the Recovery of Both Person and Goods</h3>
<p>Wang Fangshan, a fabric merchant residing at 24 Lane 147, Xinzha Road, entrusted Li Guangyu, a boatman from Jiangbei, to transport 95 packages of white fabric worth 7,000 yuan to Changzhou on the 12th of last month. However, after more than ten days, there was no news. Wang rushed to Changzhou to inquire and learned that the goods had not arrived, knowing that Li had devoured them. He secretly investigated and arrested Li at a restaurant at 485 Yu Qiaqing Road yesterday. Li confessed that the fabric was hidden in room 56 of the Hongxiang Hotel on Avenue Edward VII (now Changshu Road). He reported this to the Xinzha Police Station, which sent detective Chen Baozhong to assist in the raid on Hongxiang. 59 pieces of white fabric were seized. Later, 36 pieces of white fabric were seized on a ship at the Suzhou Road Wharf. All were taken to the police station and escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court yesterday morning. Police lawyer Li Zhishan presented the case. Li Guangyu, who was questioned, hired lawyers Fan Ganglun and En Liang to defend him. Judge Liu ordered Li to be detained pending further interrogation in seven days.</p>

<p>Case Occurs and is Sentenced to Eight Months Imprisonment</p>
<p>Shen Jinsheng, a young man from Suzhou, used to be a staff member at a tourist guide agency, so he was quite familiar with the situation of the tourist guides. Recently, affected by unemployment, he had a whimsical idea. He opened a room in a hotel and recruited tourist guides to come, and then designed to trick them out of their clothes and pawn them for money. His methods were similar to a gigolo. No less than a dozen people were deceived by him. The value of the clothes deceived was more than 1,000 yuan. He was only recently discovered by Huang Cifu, a Chinese detective from the Laozha Police Station, who arrested Shen and retrieved six original stolen coats from various pawnshops. He was escorted to the Fourth Criminal Court of the First Special Court yesterday morning. The police lawyer filed a public prosecution for fraud and theft. Shen confessed that he committed this illegal act because he was forced by hunger. Judge Meng verified the facts and sentenced Shen Jinsheng to eight months in prison on the spot. The original stolen goods were returned.</p>

<h3>On YuYuan Road</h3>
<p>By Gao Yang</p>
<p>Coincidentally, it's the end of the month today, and I have to go to YuYuan Road early in the morning.</p>
<p>Recalling a restaurant on Dingpan Road that was celebrating a happy event, two bright red characters, "乌" (Wu - surname) , were on the red lanterns at the entrance. The guests eating and drinking at the entrance were whispering to each other, saying—</p>
<p>"This place is getting a 'little one' today, and it's the 'third one'. I heard that the woman is 'from the Qunyu brothel'..."</p>
<p>"Ah, Mr. Wu is lucky today, celebrating his wedding on such an 'auspicious day'. It's truly 'accumulated from his previous life'!" An old woman with a Jiangbei accent was murmuring in her mouth, chiming in.</p>
<p>Trams and cars arriving at Zhaofeng Park all have to 'anchor' and wait there. The 'workers' there then 'order' them to stop. Then, holding palm brushes and thin paste, they stick four 'flags' and five or six strips of colorful 'slogans' on both sides of the car. Each car has to be bothered by their flurry for four or five minutes, after which they knock twice on the side, as a secret signal that 'the car can drive away'.</p>
<p>"Hey, little dog, we earned eighty cents this morning!"</p>
<p>"My mom is sick and waiting for money!"</p>
<p>It was two young children who 'paste up the advertisements' talking. Two or three others were silent, waiting for the arriving cars.</p>
<p>Looking at the arriving cars, almost all of them are pasted up. Some are already torn when they come back, so they go to patch them up again. But more and more are torn off, so they give up. They look for the paste bucket and head north towards Avenue Petain. I watched the backs of four or five ragged figures disappear into an alley, and faintly heard 'Police, stop early'.</p>
<p>Getting back on the car, there was a sign on the glass window that read: "Mini-fundraising campaign for winter clothes for orphaned children in the city". I felt a bit emotional, but the posted advertisements on the outside of the car were not visible.</p>
<p>A gust of northwest wind drilled in through the open car window, tightening the clothes of everyone on the ride, but I shivered.</p>
<p>The car rolled out of the 'outlying' area again. As soon as I got off the car at Jing'an Temple, the air pressure on my face suddenly relaxed. I deeply breathed in a mouthful of turbid cool air into my nostrils!</p>
<p>Next to the Lao Da Fang train station, black, swarthy crowds were moving. Originally this place was crowded in Japanese times, but today it seemed to carry the look of a disturbance.</p>
<p>The people standing next to the station were talking—</p>
<p>"If the police go on strike, we will also close shop..." "As long as everyone looks at the Lao Da Fang, the stores here will follow suit and 'close down'!"</p>
<p>It looks like the situation today is probably not stable. It seems like something is going to happen around YuYuan Road this afternoon, people were worried!</p>
<p>"Shanghai won't have a sudden change, will it?!" I thought to myself.</p>
<p>Walking past the police post, running into the second barbed wire 'blockade line', everyone seemed to be rescued from the abyss, and came to the 'clean land' where they could see the daylight. 'People like us who "rely on" others should also wake up. Isn't the "outlying area" a model?'</p>
<p>Looking back, I saw someone at the station tearing off the 'advertisements' on the side of the car again. Maybe some poor children's families have no firewood to burn, tearing them back to 'fuel' the fire, I didn't know how to respond.</p>

<h3>The Homecoming of the Dance Queen</h3>
<p>— By Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter Twelve: Report and Explanation</p>
<p>"He dipped in the mud and walked into the house, stopping at the edge of the carpet in the parlor. Then he walked back out and went from the east side to the front door. His intention was to let people know that someone had come in from outside and then went out again. Therefore, he went in from the west and out from the east. The two rows were clearly distinguished, and no footprints overlapped in a messy way. It's a pity that it's too clear, leaving loopholes instead!"</p>
<p>"When he went in and out, he must have held his own satin shoes in his hand. When he reached the door, he changed into his own satin cloth-soled shoes, and then he picked up the leather shoes and went straight upstairs. At that time, his movements must have been very careful, and the people in the house were all asleep, and Zhao Boyou had not returned yet, so his plan could be completed safely. When he returned upstairs, he wiped the leather shoes with his white towel and returned them to the closet. Then he went upstairs to wipe the murder weapon clean. He wrapped it with the white towel and hid all the stolen jewelry somewhere. Then he went to bed and pretended to be asleep until the sound of the gun went off. Jinmei went to knock on his door, and he pretended to wake up. Naturally, no one suspected him."</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou suddenly said, "If we had gone upstairs to search this morning, wouldn't this secret have been revealed immediately?"</p>
<p>Hawthorne nodded and said, "Yes, that was our mistake. Actually, the problem lies in the second murder. At that time, we all felt that the handgun problem was more urgent and noticeable, so I first focused on the external issues and temporarily put aside the internal issues." Hawthorne's explanation was all clear at this point. I also believe that although it was based on speculation, it must not be far from the truth. Before leaving the police station, Hawthorne called Yu Gantang out again and gave him a lecture before letting him go. I also participated in a few words during the lecture. (185)</p>
<h3>A Must-Read for Parents</h3>
<p>— Zhijian</p>
<p>We usually say: "If you raise but don't teach, it's the father's fault; if you teach but aren't strict, it's the teacher's laziness." It seems that the responsibility of "teaching" rests entirely on the teachers. Parents who only entrust their children to teachers have no "fault." In fact, it is not the case. In addition to "raising," parents also have the responsibility of "teaching." Wise parents are often their children's best teachers. Mencius's mother moved three times for the sake of her son's future; if Edison had not had his mother's encouragement and guidance, he would probably have been considered a "bad egg" in the end.</p>
<p>If you are a parent, how do you discipline your children? Strict beatings and scoldings? Excessive indulgence that is like spraying water? Or do you not care about anything and let your children do whatever they want?</p>
<p>Furthermore, before disciplining your children, have you understood everything about them? Their temperament, their aspirations, and so on.</p>
<p>(1) Do you know your children's temperament?</p>
<p>(2) Do you know your children's aspirations?</p>
<p>(3) Do you know your children's attitude towards you?</p>
<p>(4) Do your children have a sense of responsibility?</p>
<p>(5) Do your children have a sense of public morality?</p>
<p>(6) Do your children have the ability to self-govern?</p>
<p>(7) Do you know your children's strengths?</p>
<p>(8) Do you know your children's difficulties?</p>
<p>(9) Do you know what books and newspapers your children like?</p>
<p>(10) Do you know how your children spend money?</p>
<p>(11) Do your children have their own thoughts?</p>
<p>(12) Do your children have a skill?</p>
<p>(13) Do your children care about world events?</p>
<p>(14) Are your children's grades excellent?</p>
<p>(15) Do you know the state of your children's health?</p>
<p>(16) Do you know the reasons for your children's physical weakness?</p>
<p>(17) Do you know about your children's life during puberty?</p>
<p>(18) Do you know your children's height and weight?</p>
<p>(19) Do your children like fitness exercises?</p>
<p>(20) Do you and your children have organizational skills?</p>
<p>(21) Do you know about your children's vacation life?</p>
<p>(22) Do you know what groups your children participate in?</p>
<p>(23) Do you know your children's favorite entertainment?</p>
<p>(24) Do you know who your children's friends are?</p>
<p>(25) Do your children have the opportunity to talk to you every day?</p>
<h3>The "Kitchen" is Too Close</h3>
<p>— Mang Bei</p>
<p>Gentlemen and ladies wearing fine leather are often "annoyed" to see a beggar using the Shen Bao newspaper as clothing. Men and women who come out of a bar often "hate" to see a 'bum' using a cigarette tin and a tree branch to stir watery porridge.</p>
<p>The reason is very simple. It is the principle of: "…hearing their cries, one cannot bear to eat their flesh, therefore the gentleman keeps his distance from the kitchen!" But it is not entirely like this.</p>
<p>In ancient times, gentlemen "could not bear" it, so they had to "keep their distance from the kitchen" before they would "eat their flesh." Although it seems to be fighting "foolishness," the heart is actually extremely "soft." Otherwise, why not "eat stewed meat in the slaughterhouse!"</p>
<p>But people nowadays are different after all. "Cannot bear" is certainly out of the question, but "annoyance" and "hatred" do exist. However, one cannot "blame them too harshly"...</p>
<p>Because, if we consider the reasons for their "annoyance" and "hatred," it must be because they themselves are wearing too warm and eating too full, while in front of them is that "sour look," and they feel a little "ashamed" (or rather, "embarrassed"), and...resulting in "under a fit of anger" (this is "turning shame into anger"), they develop feelings of "annoyance" and hatred.</p>
<p>So, in the final analysis, this is because the "kitchen" is too close. If it were a battle far away in Xu Yuan, it might not be like this. Otherwise, even with cotton stuffed in their ears, they could still "eat their flesh" with gusto!</p>

<h3>Apprenticeship in Film Art</h3>
<p>— Shunyi</p>
<p>A Talk with Annan Overseas Student Yang Hua</p>
<p>Yang Hua has the characteristics of any young man from the South: extremely bold, adventurous, enthusiastic, and living a very active life. He reads "various" books: literature, opera, movies, Chinese and English novels, etc. One day, I had a very interesting conversation with him. He said: "I grew up in 'Annan.' My mother and sisters still live there. I originally wanted to go back first and then run to 'Yunnan' to study at 'Southwest Associated University.' If I couldn't get in, if the border was closed, I would stay in 'Annan'." He spoke enthusiastically and unrestrainedly about his wishes: "Please send me books, magazines, and newspapers regularly. I can tell the overseas Chinese in any part of 'Annan' what I know. I will also write newsletters to you about the situation of the overseas Chinese and the customs, political situation, etc. of Annan. Also, my sister studied in 'Annan' and is completely an 'Annan' person. She can tell me about 'Annan's literary classics' and I can translate them into Chinese——" But since I entered the 'Guolian' [likely a specific organization, not the League of Nations] to receive training, I no longer study at 'University.' I will go to act and make movies. Regarding movies, I know that he has been on camera many times. He doesn't like 'period costumes.' A reporter friend told me that 'Bu Wancang' [a famous director] admires him very much.——Because of this, one evening, while wandering on Avenue Joffre [now Middle Huaihai Road], I curiously asked him: 'I really don't understand. Now, big stars always take pride in being college students, as if telling people "I'm not just making movies and being a young actor, I'm a college student, I'm going to do this and that in the future." Why would a college student like you give up university and specialize in making movies as an apprentice?'"</p>
<p>"It's very simple," he smiled seriously, "I want to be an apprentice to a film artist." After a pause: "Studying at university is a kind of life, making movies is also a kind of life, but I feel that the latter is more suitable for me."</p>
<p>He is an apprentice to a film artist. When he studied at Fudan University, his name was 'He Xiqin.' 'Yang Hua' is his 'stage name' after joining the film troupe. He is only twenty-two years old and has a beautiful future. I can't help but bless him.</p>
<h3>The Wanderings of Mr. Wang</h3>
<p>— Luo Cun</p>
<p>The pretty boy "Wang Laowu" [Mr. Wang, Fifth Oldest], meets the "femme fatale," "La Dame aux Camélias" [Camille], abandons the "joy of family," and takes flight in a "Night Flight," escaping to "Fuchun River" and associating with "King Xiang Yu" and "Huang Tianba," calling himself "Three Musketeers," forcibly takes rich family's "woman" and "Street Angel" as "One Night Queen," and is then pursued by the "Wild River Heroine" "Qin Liangyu" to "Sixty Years Later Shanghai." Then, he has the troubles of "First Love" with the nickname "Night Pearl" "Li Sanniang," which soon leads to "Peach Blossom News," causing the mess of the "Broadcasting Station Massacre," and is then detained in the "New Hell." Fortunately, his "Sea Sky Lovers" "Meng Jiangnu" rescues him to "Flying Flower Village," where he spends his "Free World" days. Before long, he has a "Precious Pearl" "Little Heroine," "becoming a wealthy and glorious" family, and living his "Gold and Silver World" life. But good times don't last long. In the prosperity of "Burning of the Red Lotus Temple," his wife and daughter "Beggar's Daughter" have become wandering "lost lambs" at the "Crossroads." Later, with the help of the "Mine Riding Knight" "Little Doctor," he braves the "Storm" in the "Horror" to rush to the "Gilded City," residing in a "Seventh Heaven" apartment. On quiet nights, he hears the "Midnight Song" of "The Orphan's Mother's Story," and then wife and daughter reunite and mutually lament "Mr. Wang's Hardship Eating!" Later, with a flash of inspiration, "Mr. Wang is Good at Making Money," he takes out the "Pearl Shirt" and buys the alias "Red Flower Vase" "Pan Qiaoyun" as a "Money Tree," and performs the obscene drama "The Hell's Accusation of Beauty." "He Hired Madame Diao and Liu with Huge Sum," and "Empress Wu Zetian" participates in the performance of "Spring Colors of the Palace." Later, he is extorted by one called "Yellow Sea Pirate" for ten huge sums. Mr. Wang then plucks the "Pipa Record" in his heart. Before sunrise, he and his wife and daughter embark on the "New Human Path" to seek help from the old gentleman "Confucius," but on the way, they suddenly encounter the "Unparalleled Beauty" "Meng Lijun," and he falls into the web of love again. Then, he encounters the "Cloud Dress Fairy" "Wang Baojian," making it difficult for him to choose. Later, obeying his wife's command, he steps onto the "Mr. Wang Returns to the Countryside" "Road" to achieve his path of repentance.</p>
<h3>Early Opening of the Golden Capital Grand Theater</h3>
<p>— Xing Xing</p>
<p>The Gift Money Will Be Moved to Shelters to Help Those in Need - The First Film Decided is "Romance of the Western Chamber"</p>
<p>The Golden Capital Grand Theater is managed by the Liu brothers and is currently under active construction. The location is at the intersection of Avenue Foch [now Yan'an West Road] and Rue du Tofu [a small side street]. It was originally scheduled to open on Christmas of this year, but the authorities of the Golden Capital, in order to open earlier, decided to open on the 20th of this month. That is, the official opening is on the 20th.</p>
<p>The opening of the Golden Capital, various circles in Shanghai inevitably have some ceremonial exchanges. It is said that the Golden Capital authorities, in view of the large number of refugees in Shanghai, and that severe winter has arrived, which is certainly a great threat, so the Liu brothers decided on a method, hoping that all circles will give cash instead of gifts, and then all of the gift money will be transferred to the refugee shelters held by the Federation of Charitable Organizations to benefit the poor refugees. This is a good deed in the entertainment industry. Finally, it must be reported that the first film for the opening of the Golden Capital is the singing film "Romance of the Western Chamber" starring Zhou Xuan and Bai Yun.</p>
<h3>Listening to the Qin at the Yuqin Society</h3>
<p>— Master of the Zhenxia Pavilion</p>
<p>In the autumn of Gengchen [1940], the Yuqin Society held a qin gathering at the Zhongshi Club. It was a monthly gathering. A corner of a small building, the windows and doors opened in all directions. In the midst of the hustle and bustle, to find such a place slightly isolated from the city is truly a beautiful realm. I had just returned from Kezhou, and after being exposed to the dust and vulgarity, I listened again to the elegance of the songs, and had the feeling of Xiangshan's poem "As if listening to immortal music, my ears are temporarily clear." The gentlemen in the society, as if mourning the elegant art, all studied diligently, which was pleasing. But Wu Zijinglue was especially outstanding. His rhythm was fast and slow, hitting the mark. His fingering was both firm and gentle. Each plucking, each vibrato, did not leave a trace but fully conformed to the rules. The meaning of the music was profound, reaching beyond the mundane. Playing "Yangchun," the spirit of flourishing emerges from his fingertips, like a hundred flowers blooming, with myriad scenes. Playing "Xiaoxiang," the emotion of the moving clouds and water, the sound of the wind in the valley, as if one is experiencing it firsthand, drifting away with the desire to escape the world. Playing "Changmen," the strings concealed the tragic mood, weeping and complaining, expressing resentment without anger, sorrow without injury, fully grasping what is called "the gentle language of children, without losing the demeanor of an empress." Other pieces, such as the beauty of "Plum Blossom," the solemnity of "Pu'an," and the back-and-forth of "Remembering Old Friends," all expressed their meaning fully,暢其曲情 [Unsure of this phrase]. To say that he is unparalleled for a time is certainly not flattery. In this time of ancient music falling into silence, how could there be more people like Zijinglue, rising together to promote it, so that the people of the world know that the quintessence of the country is worthy of cherishing, and not treating it like worn-out shoes! Because the people in the society listen to the members playing the qin, there should be no need to write a record. But Zijinglue's attainment in qin studies is truly worthy of being a model, so I record my admiration. How could it be said to be praise?</p>
<h3>Talking about the Three Pillars of the Yifeng Society</h3>
<p>— Du Zhong</p>
<p>Mr. Zhou Xinfang's return to the stage this autumn after recovering from his illness is much better than before, but his voice is even brighter, and his singing is round and full. Recently, listening to his "Black Man Accusing" and "Four Visits to Mother," singing in double rhyme, he is quite competent, not repeating his old tones, which is truly commendable. As for his acting, he is meticulous from beginning to end, without any slack. The "Asking the Woodcutter" in "Black Man Accusing," "Hitting the Stick Out of the Box," and the "Crying in the Hall" sections in "Visiting Mother" are delicate and well-done. The beauty of his postures is truly admirable. As for his disciple Gao Baishui, he remains the same. In the "Sitting in the Palace" section of "Visiting Mother," he just yells with his throat. There are a few places where he is indeed refreshing. But in the "Turning Head to Call the Little Barbarian" tune, because the previous tune was too high, it was almost impossible to turn higher here. Also, that day he sang the call "Virtuous Princess, my wife" as "Virtuous Princess, my son," causing a big laugh in the hall. Wang Xichun also laughed all over her face. Speaking of Wang Xichun, her return to the stage this time is much more improved than before. Before, everyone said that she didn't know how to act and relied entirely on her beautiful appearance. This time, her body and face can be seen, probably because she learned "expressions" from filming a few movies. Her voice is also strong, and she sings more lively than before. I hope she takes good care of herself.</p>
<h3>Brief News</h3>
<p>(1) The Zhizhong Drama Society of Zhizhong Girls' Middle School on Nanyang Road performed "The Unparalleled Beauty Empress" two years ago, which won praise from all walks of life. Now they will perform "Women's Apartment," scheduled to be performed at the Lafayette Theater at 9:00 am on the 8th. There will be wonderful performances at that time. (2) The Central Grand Theater recently invested in installing the latest snow splashing release projector and audio machine, and the interior has been completely renewed.</p>
<h3>Twenty Kinds of Yue Opera</h3>
<p>— Written by Dong Yun, Illustrated by Xiu Yan</p>
<p>(Seventeen) Killing Son for Revenge</p>
<p>The play "Killing Son for Revenge" is the most common. Not only does Yue Opera have it, but every kind of drama has it. The plot is about a lewd and wicked woman who is passionately in love with her lover, and hates her own son for being nosy and an eyesore. Killing him is not enough. She even chops his corpse into pieces by hand. Her ruthless hand is equal to that of the Zhou Qinji brothers.</p>
<p>Wang Shi in the "Killing Son for Revenge" play is "charming" on the first half of the stage and wins with "unruly" in the second half. In terms of dramatic personality, "Yue Opera" is more neat and unruly than "Non-Opera." It is easier to please the audience by performing this kind of play. (See picture)</p>
<p>(Eighteen) Three Views of the Imperial Sister</p>
<p>Just hearing the name of the play, it seems very "unpopular." In fact, it is "Double-Linked Pen." Ballads and Southern Opera both have this version.</p>
<p>Miss Liu Dingjin has rendered meritorious service in conquering the barbarians and is awarded the title of "Princess" (called "Imperial Sister" in Yue Opera, which is quite charming and unique). She burns incense at the Tianqi Temple. Three days in advance, the people are notified that stealing the appearance of the princess is prohibited, and violators will be beheaded!</p>
<p>Feng Jiajin is a poor painter who is willing to risk being considered improper, wanting to see how beautiful the princess is. On the day the princess burns incense, he disguises himself as a farmer named Zhang Xiaoer, hiding under the offering table in the Tianqi Temple, hoping to see the princess. Unexpectedly, he is discovered on the spot. Feng Jiajin falsely claims, "This lowly person has a mother who is about to die! I specially came to offer incense to make a wish, to wish the old woman will not need medicine." The princess is kind-hearted and releases him. After leaving the temple, Feng finds the princess's beauty delightful. One view is not enough. He enters the temple again, which is called "Second View."</p>
<p>The princess finds his words elegant and his appearance dignified. After returning to the palace, she even "a tiny heart, pines for the man." It goes so far that the imperial physician is at a loss. A notice is posted to seek treatment. Feng Jiajin takes down the notice and enters the palace, which is the third time he sees the princess.</p>
<p>Later, the lovers eventually become a couple.</p>
