<h3>蘇芬和平後的蘇聯與遠東</h3>
<p>蘇芬和平成立後，緊接着蘇日關係又進入緊張微妙的情態：諾蒙亨再度發生衝突的傳說雖經日軍部否認，斥為毫無常識，庫頁島方面的糾紛却又接踵而來，據日方傳出的消息，本月十一日曾有蘇聯飛機飛入該島日境，十五日雙方邊界的步哨又發生局部衝突。不管事實眞相及其演變究竟如何，這無疑會牽引世人對芬蘭灣和喀萊利亞地峽方面的視綫，轉而注意蘇日蘇偽邊境的風雲。</p>
<p>如果單從事態的表面來看，也許會有人認為上述種種都是穌聯遠東政策轉趨積極的表現，因而懷具過早的樂觀；殊不知蘇聯就是在以全力對付芬蘭的過程中，對於遠東局勢也始終保持着嚴厲的戒備，根本不曾有過消極的一頁。去秋蘇德締結互不侵犯協定之初，一般見解多認為蘇聯即將轉而對日强硬起來，不料繼續的一幕却是諾蒙亨的停戰和蘇軍開進波蘭。固然，目前蘇聯西境已獲得絕對安全無復遭受侵襲的危險，但在目前複雜錯綜的國際局勢之下，蘇方實未必把從日方來的威脅看得那樣嚴重，竟至立即從事行動。縱觀目前種種事實，與其說庫頁島一類的衝突是蘇聯對日轉趨積極，無寗認為是日方對蘇有重採攻勢的企圖還較近事理。</p>
<p>蘇芬間的一慕戰事，結果雖使蘇聯獲得西境女全的保障，另一方面，却也促成西歐國家反蘇運動的復活，國際間援芬的呼聲和措置均以此一反蘇運動為最主要的動力。現在蘇芬縱吿和平，反蘇策動却未必驟然中止；如果喧傳已久的進攻蘇聯口號眞要逐步見諸事實的話，則在蘇聯的全部邊境中，自以遠束部分為最易受攻擊的一環。這種可能，在日本當局當屬籌之已熟，並且會把目前的國際局勢認作一個難得的良好機會。數月前日本一部份軍人和外交家的親蘇呼聲，論者早已斷定為威嚇列强的一種姿態，其眞意無非企圖轉而取得列强的讓步，藉以助其解決無法自拔的侵華戰事。所以儘管東京方面一再透露出蘇日接近的消息，事實上却始終一無成就，連蒙偽間的劃界談判都以無結果而中止。月餘以來，日本的親蘇呼聲漸歸沈寂，代之而興的却是戒備蘇聯恫嚇蘇聯的論調，恰與國際間的反蘇空氣桴鼓相應。其實這不過是日方對付列强的另一種姿態，幻想藉此獲得具有反蘇意態各國的垂靑和同情，其目的與前此的偽裝親蘇並沒有什麼兩樣。到這幾天，蘇芬戰事甫告停止，蘇日衝突的消息却不斷由東京方面傳出來，這也許是巧合，但也未必不是一個値得注意的試探。</p>
<p>蘇芬間的戰事，無疑是近來國際事變中令人最感不快的一慕，現在既幸已化干戈為玉帛，則由那一戰事而引起的種種事態在原則上也應該隨之告一段落，如反蘇運動即其一例。也許在西歐列强某些人的意識中間，把反蘇看得比對德作戰更重要，其實這並不是、一種健全的念頭；如果列强與蘇聯間的關係眞繼續惡化下去，則蘇德勢將結合愈緊，益加重協的國的困難，在遠東更給予侵略者的日本以買空賣空的操縱機會，藉反蘇的幌子向協約國作討價還價的張本，這在協的國都屬有百害而無一利的事。「九一八」至今快十年了，星星之火早已擴為燎原之局，各個列强間不能協調的痼疾依然沒有多少改進，這是遠東的不幸，也更是列强自身的不幸。差喜中國依然振作有為，獨力担當起遏阻侵略的重責，把日閥拖得疲敝不堪。而在國際關係上，列强間却依然給日閥存留着縱橫裨闔伺隙蹈瑕的餘地，使其經常徘徊於反英反蘇姿態之間以肆其要挾和恫嚇，這種情形繼續下去，吃虧的絕非中國，却是列强自己。有如英日密的蘇日締不侵協定等類傳說，我們相信都只是不根的讕言，但在國際間却有時往往發生微妙的影響。現在日方又藉反蘇進行試探了，其反應如何自然是値得注意的事，而另一方面，蘇聯縱即有對日採取積極動作的準備，也必不免因國際間之互存猜忌而有所顧慮。今日各個列强在遠東的立塲，大都堅定不移，原不容有置疑餘地，只有彼此間之不能協調却是個重大弱點，亟待關心遠東機運的人士從事努力。</p>

<h3>歐洲和戰前途　唯有羅斯福洞若觀火　英法政策遭兩重失敗　土耳其需要十年和平</h3>
<p>羅馬　截至昨晚為止、英法德戰事可望結束之機會、究有幾分、全世界除墨索里尼微有所知外、洞悉全局者僅二人、即美總統羅斯福與國務副卿威爾斯是也、唯彼二人始知此行是吾徒勞往返、威氏以調人之資格、奔走羅馬柏林巴黎倫敦之間、逞其如簧之舌、企圖發見可能之條件、俾羅斯福據以為準、調停歐戰而使和平之希望實現、計已三星期矣、今威氏於返國之前、重來此間、昨晚且與墨氏作第二次會談、則和歟戰歟似猶在未定之天、回憶威氏與墨氏及其壻齊亞諾初决會商時、英法正在覔取新戰塲、訪求戰略家、蓋齊格斐防綫固若金湯、堅拒協的國於德國西疆之外、而協的國亦巳察見、非冒不韙以破壞若干國家之中立、決不能攻入德國境內、今威氏為和平而與墨氏等作最後之談話時、聞倫敦與巴黎方面、猶堅持彼等之意見、而謂正在覓取某種方法、以試騐眞正戰爭之力量、但雙方開戰巳歷六月又半、協的國迄未能覓得一處、可由該處予德國以有效之打擊、至於德國、則除通過馬奇諾陣綫外、亦無他法直接襲擊協約國、溯自威爾斯於上月二十五日抵此以來、歐洲局勢巳大有變動、全歐人士皆謂芬蘭之不向英法正式請援、乃英法外交上之失敗、並謂芬蘭似不信任協約國、故未與英法磋商、即與蘇聯議和、英法二國政府之軍事政策、與并交政策、現正受各方面之批評、國內輿情、亦正在發生激烈之辯論、兩國之一部分人民、均要求與蘇聯作戰、以為此乃襲擊德國之唯一方法、但土耳其之政策、適與外間所盛傳者相反、土國之不願淪本國為戰塲、一如斯堪的那維亞諸國、然則協約國又將何從而進攻蘇聯乎、此間接近土政府之人員吿記者曰、「直接反對蘇聯之條約、土國決不簽訂、故土國與英法所訂盟的中、並無一語可使土國在協約國萬一與蘇作戰時、不得不亦負對蘇作戰之義務、土國至少需要十年之和平、土國所受地震之損失、非常重大、人民之死傷者、超過德軍攻波一役中之死傷總數、以視協約國於其所謂戰事中六個月以來之損失、且不知若干倍也」、故德人安坐於齊格斐防綫之後、向協約國呼曰「來」、而協約國則無法覓得戰塲、於是戰爭即陷於進退維谷之境、有利於威氏此行之使命者、大概僅此獨一無二之最大要素而已、惟同時聞義國宜稱、百萬義靑年巳受軍事訓練、且已有相當之配備、其中包括準備就編之三軍團云、又據此間外交界息、德義蘇匈羅五國擬結成集團、惟此說尙未證實、（國際社特派員魏剛十七日電）</p>

<h3>義大利與歐戰　（義大利日報主蓋達撰）</h3>
<p>歐戰爆發以還、倐巳六月、世人輒相叩問曰、「義大利究竟作何感想耶」、蓋歐洲各大國中、惟有義大利尙未牽入戰局、加之墨索里尼首相所公開聲明之義國政策、僅以非交戰國自居、而並未宣吿中立、可見義國亦非切實自外於現行戰事、職是之故、義國之觀念與態度、對於歐戰前途實屬異常重要、其舉足重輕而具有決定的性質、彰彭明甚、此在義國方面、深覺現行戰事定必曠日持久、</p>
<p>勝敗之數未可逆覩</p>
<p>而消耗必鉅、雖共認此戰為無益之舉、而參戰各國非戰至筋疲力盡不巳、但自啟釁以來、種極預測均為事實所否認、即如大規模空襲、迄今尙未實現、誠以雙方均不欲首先發難、藉免招致對方之報復、是以可怖的空戰、反因其可怖性而得避免、同時雙方在陸上亦復躊躇不敢作運動戰、亦不敢仿效拿破崙式或普魯士式戰術而毅然出擊、此種情形、、與其謂由於法國馬奇諾防綫與德國齊格菲防綫均堅不可拔、雙方各有所恃、遂矜持不事進攻毌寗謂由於雙方對於作戰方式、作不同的衡量所致、實較為確切、以德國而言、於征略波蘭國之後、即曾宜佈西綫無作戰之必要、不願以戎首自居、此在英法兩國雖饒於資財、而國內人口、則不若是其多、自有節省人力之必要、故其作戰基礎、着重於經濟政治與社會方面、而軍事方面次之、質言之、各該國期望用嚴峻的</p>
<p>靜止方式包圍德國</p>
<p>消耗其資源、斷絕其接濟、俾不必大舉作戰、即可逐漸削弱其抵抗力、從而獲致勝利、雙方以衝量之不同、釀成此形勢、於是勝負之數愈不可測、而自始至終、其消耗程度之大從可知矣、英法兩國之採此策略、自以估計德國抵抗力究能如何持久、為其決策之基礎、抑知各種統計、每每不足以衡量抵抗之實力、曩者義國征伐阿比西尼亞、各國曾實施制裁竟吿失敗、即其殷鑒、就此次戰時之德國而論、無論在物質上精神上、必已具有充分準備、蓋在過去數年間、德國已積存大批原料如鋼、鐵、銅、橡皮、棉花等、莫不充裕他如經濟方面旣能自給自足、又擁有巨額現金準備、此項現金凡分四類、第一、前在馬克慘落時代、即已積存巨額黃金與外滙、彼時世界各國競爭投機、德國因得將其毫無價値之紙幣、換取黃金與外匯、第二、在美國獲有金元商業借款甚多第三、頻年以來對外貿易出超甚鉅、第四、自兼併奧地利與捷克兩國後、巳將各該國家銀行之準備金併入德意志銀行、四者之外、半年來英法兩國所採靜止與虛擬的戰略、亦是使德國節省軍用品、且加緊製造培養實力、惟是於此遷延日復一日、迄至最後該國抵抗力定必消失凈盡、殆可斷言、但英法兩國亦</p>
<p>不免蒙受嚴重損害</p>
<p>影響所及、且不僅限於經濟財政、甚至可延及甚帝國利益、此種利益散佈愈廣大、其脆弱亦愈甚、</p>
<p>準是而論、此項戰爭之勝敗如何、自吾儕義大利人視之、雖未可逆料、但不利於歐洲、要無疑義、墨索里尼首相有鑒於此、凡百努力皆所以防杜於未萌、遏止於巳發、顧英法兩國方自誇其經濟財力之優越、世界制海權與政治勢力之普遍、以為制勝之道即在於此、且可操左券、由英法之所誇耀、吾人乃聯想及於所謂「改造歐洲」問題、此項問題固各交戰國所時時樂道者也、考之世界現狀、少數國家擁有雄厚之實力、故在未戰之前、彼亦自信勝算在握、其壟斷把持之餘、歐洲安得維持均勢、和平安得獲有保障、此中因果顯然莫可為諱、誠以歐洲之資源、自始未能按照各國族之品質曁人權公民權而作公道之分配、此種情况、自凡爾賽和的成立而益甚、厥後、歐洲政局因而擾攘者歷二十年之久、終至釀成此决大戰、溯本窮源、瞻前顧後、新歐洲當為光榮的和平之結果、必以</p>
<p>樹立均勢為大前提</p>
<p>不然雖欲改造而不可得也、此外、英法兩國尙有一端、常引以自豪者、以為英國掌握地中海出入咽喉、可任意加以封鎖、此種見解、可於各該國報紙見之、夫如是宣揚、其用意安在、豈欲警吿義大利、謂宜倘屬地中海、形同囚犯乎、英法此種意態、亦與新歐洲各國務須自由平等之義、大相逕庭、此在義大利、對於所謂新歐洲之觀念、甚為簡明、即義國不欲在歐洲或在全世界企圖獲有何種特權、對於任何制度、凡直接間接使一國或數國獲取霸權者、皆所反對、惟必須分別言之者、義國方面尙有若干生存攸關之問題、迄今並無着落、凡此問題、凡爾　體系各國匪特未謀解決、反予以增劇、要之、此類問題必須依照義國需要、覓取解決方案、實已刻不容緩、關於此點、歐洲各大國務須澈底了解、原</p>
<p>義國需要不外兩端</p>
<p>其一、需要自由與富饒的空間、以供義國人民發展之用、俾得在義國領土內和平工作、其二、義大利民族需要生活與行動的自由、應有權排除一切外國控制的制度、深信此種需要、儘可在「凡爾賽立塲」之外、在更公允的健全的歐洲申、覓致解決之道、然則此種新歐洲、究應如何組成之乎、戰爭耶、和平耶、何去何從、甚難預卜、各國旣不欲自處於此種組織之外、爰不取中立國之地位、其在目前、雖與戰局無直接關係、但準備在將來和戰中保持置喙之地位、故對於此决歐洲戰爭暨各種事態之演化、無不極端注意、所望厥為新歐洲之吿成、無須擴大戰爭、是以義國所行政策、夙以防止戰爭擴大範圍為主旨、此後歐戰之能否擴大、雖當視各交戰國政治的軍事的計劃以為轉移、巴爾幹半島與地中海方面、目前雖已感受威脅、但義國所把握之政策、則業已有所成就矣、溯自蘇聯勢力侵入多瑙河流域並威脅巴爾幹半島之後、歐洲已發生新問題、須知義大利對於東南歐是否有</p>
<p>共產威脅決不漠視</p>
<p>此無他、義國地位旣與多瑙河流域各國有輔車相依之勢、且巳成為巴爾幹半島極大的一國、其在該方面所保有之利益、具有永久的生存有關的性質故也、惟義國對於蘇聯絕無何種侵略計畫、此與列强逈不相同、因義國主旨、僅欲阻止共產主義之蔓延、消除甚對於歐洲文明秩序健全制度之威脅而已、綜上所述、義國對於共產主義所抱政策、在實質上乃為樹立健全與文明的歐洲政策相與不可分離之一部份、蘇聯儘可在其國境之內高枕而臥、義國初無敵視之意、反之、共產主義若果企圖侵入歐洲與義國生存利益之區域、則法西期主義固知所以應付之道也（哈瓦斯社譯）</p>

<h3>朱家驊論歐戰　對華並無不利（續）　中國外交運用游刃有餘　且負世界和平重要使命　六·歐戰與中國</h3>
<p>綜上所說、英法在經濟上是處於優越地位的、但僅靠經濟力最使德國屈服、即能獲致、也祗能在遙遙的未來、國際情勢、瞬息萬變、而每一事變、均足以影響戰局、現時交戰國雙方各自努力尋求與國、藉以增厚本身力量、並激勵本國民氣、然中立國家不勝其惶惑與恐懼、因惶惑恐懼而觀望趦趄、而圖兩面修好、這種狀態也是歐戰遲遲展佈原因之一、</p>
<p>戰爭沒有展開、而外交戰早已極盡其能事了、舊日軍事家所說「戰時的一切政治主張均由砲口發出」的理論、已被現代縱橫捭闔的政治家破壞無遺了、我們預測歐戰的前途、首先應該認識、當這次戰爭發軔的時候、早已呈露出世界性戰爭的輪廓、除開了回天有術得中途妥協面外、歐戰會演變成爲全世界戰爭、是一件極自然的事、也是一件極平庸的事、星星之火、已足以燎原、況在遠東有中國瞬即踏入第四年代的對日本抗戰、在北歐有劇烈進行的蘇芬戰爭呢、</p>
<p>其次、我們應該認識的、是中日戰爭與歐戰的相關性、乃至不可分性、目前強暴的日本、被中國絆着了、不能有所作爲不能趁火打刦、這可以說、中國對世界已盡了無窮大的責任、</p>
<p>歐戰前途怎樣、我們不便遽下判斷、但我們相信、歐戰的中途妥協或延長下去、其影響所及、對於我們是不會有不利的、這因爲我們的抗戰國策、早經確定、抗戰兩年八個月的基礎、牢不可動、外交操之在我、自能游刃有餘地運用、</p>
<p>但我們倒要堅決地把握著這次歐戰的機會、消極上粉碎日方的侵略政治、積極上完成我們復興民族的任務、尤其要全世界認清中國在整個世界和平上所負的使命是何等重要、所貢獻世界的是何等偉大、則中國所應得的酬報——自由獨立主權行政之完整、又是如何的正大呢、　（完）</p>

<h3>外僑年會議案　納稅人密切注視　如果提出增加捐稅問題　必將成為劇烈辯論焦點</h3>
<p>公共租界納稅華人會、前因工部局董事會議決、自七月一日起、徵收市政總捐及地捐等附加稅百分之五十擬提交納稅西人年會討論、即據巿民聯合會函述市民不勝負担情形、請予撤消原議、由納秘華人會轉函工部局抗議後、茲接工部局函復、以此項抗議、當提交董事會考慮不誤、</p>
<p>年會程序</p>
<p>公共租界本年度外僑納稅人年會、已定於四月十七日舉行、選舉局董　　產委員、則先於四月十日十一日舉行、地產委員會工部局代表一人、局方現巳決定重派勃倫脫君擔任、按勃君在地產委員會代表工部局、巳歷時十載、本年度外僑年會之議程、將仍如往常、循例由總董致詞、報吿一年來施致狀况、繼討論市政年度預算決算、並聞納稅外僑年會程序規則、本屆年會有加以修正之說、俾會議程序、更能井然明瞭、</p>
<p>辯論焦點</p>
<p>至所擬自本年七月一日起增加市政總捐、特別房捐、及地捐附加費百分之五十案、是否因各方反對、中止此項擬議、刻尙無聞悉、當此外僑年會開會在即、各方一致予以重視、惟衆料此案若果提出年會、必將成為劇烈辯論之中心、因中外納稅人在此時艱、咸不願且實無力再增仟何負担也、</p>
<p>旅業意見</p>
<p>旅館業同業因工部局此决增加總捐、負担過重、於前日函請公共租界華人納稅會曁工部局華董虞洽卿、籲請收回成命、現悉該同業待有復函時、將召集會議、討論應付、昨據旅館公會某君稱、工部局此次對一百五六十家中國式之中等旅館所增加之捐稅、頗使該業不能負祖、緣自戰後各項物價高達數倍、而各同業所增加之房租、僅為四成、故各同業維持目前之營業、已感困難、遑論冉加重捐、按此次工部局對同業之捐稅、將由每季四十元增至一百三十餘元、</p>
<h3>評價委員會商議　塊煤標準市價　煤商無意囤積抑價出棧　煤球平賣仍擬繼續辦理</h3>
<p>兩租界當局自成立評價委員會後、迭經研討、僉以物價飛漲、不外囤積操縱所致、尤以米煤兩項為最、惟該會對煤價一節、深切注意、曾數度派員向煤業及煤球兩公會詢以各項煤塊騰漲癥結、及煤球製造成本、與煤屑來源、並督促煤業公會辦理煤塊登記、俾便統計、茲聞該評價委員會對於煤塊售價、商議具體標準、將付諸實施、一面擬督促煤業界儘量販運、藉增存底、現各大戶已紛紛抑價出棧、無意囤積、以免無論損失、而遭制裁、</p>
<p>繼續平售</p>
<p>煤球平賣、自開始以還、迄已兩週有餘、各處情形至為良好、茲已將期滿、惟該業為嘉惠平民起見、擬繼續辦理、該業公會為商討妥善辦法計、己定於本月二十日下午三時、在天津路會听、召開各廠聯席會議、俾便從長討論、聞屆時對於各廠供給平球、及平賣地點手續、均將提出商討、予以改善、對於各平賣煤球行號、亦擬力勸其繼續担任、</p>
<p>煤商意見</p>
<p>本市煤球市價、自經巿商會會同煤業各有關團體議定限價後、每噸二百十元、每担五元八角、茲因各煤球工廠成本浩大、曾函請市商會予以救濟、新聲社記者昨特往訪某煤商、叩以救濟煤球廠意見、據某氏表示、（一）非平賣煤球、請酌予增加巿價、（二）平賣煤球應增加數量、及平賣地點、以期普遍、（三）平賣日期、應以煤球市價為標準、如煤球跌至百元內或五十元內、即行停止、（四）增加購買平球數量、最好每人每次以一元為限、誌之以備一說</p>
<p>柴炭運滬</p>
<p>滬市整個燃料問題、自由市商會出而設法後、煤塊·柴炭市價、已步趨下跌、市塲現貨倍增、昨據柴炭業方面消息、茲滬甬航班增多、堆積甬埠之溫台柴炭、業巳絡續裝輪運滬調劑、因散裝簍裝不一、故運埠數量無從統計、茲該業為增厚存底、免除恐慌起見、連日向上海市商會發證明書、繼續派員向浙江產區採購、故滬巿燃料恐慌、可無形解除、</p>

<h3>最進步的遺精治法　願為手淫斵傷者一助</h3>
<p>— 俄國勞働大學醫科畢業楊道南醫師</p>
<p>犯手淫的青年多半給環境引誘的　遺精過久之後一切衰弱毛病釀成</p>
<p>遺精一症雖不僅山手淫而起，然因手淫斵傷而陷於重篤者，頗不乏人，至於靑年之喜犯手淫，在我們的醫生眼光裏看起來，多半給環境引誘的，此外喜看淫書淫畫的靑年，大都是靠不住的。其次是被生理上所趨迫，因爲已經達到相當年齡而仍有包皮的人，受包皮中堆積之分泌物所刺戟，極容易誘促手淫行爲，因手淫而惹起色的亢奮，慾火上昇，神志不淸，遺精失眠遂難避免。</p>
<p>關於手淫之害的硏究，一般略有醫學常識的人，都知爲釀成腦神經與性機能衰弱之本源，爲什麽呢？因爲手淫只憑不自然之空想力，將全神集中一點，使腦中激起色情的幻想，故易使腦神經疲勞，結果，使腦中受損，頭昏，腦漲，耳鳴，健忘等症。同時勃起與射精機能，受手淫之斵傷亦失却常態，故有時在白晝偶一衝動，即吿滑精，全身健康失常，面色蒼白，發育不全，腎虧，早洩，陰痿，不妊等症，差不多完全受此種惡症不治而形成，若不積極治療，生命之保障毫無，此誠危險之至。</p>
<p>依余多年來治療此種疾病的經騐所知，德國睪丸精質製劑男用「補體康」治手淫斵傷，神經衰弱，發育不全，腦弱腎虧，最爲對症，惟遺精頻繁，先以「耐而斯遺精片」止其遺精，總之凡有此種疾病之人，應兩藥同服，日間三次，應服「補體康」的每决二粒，睡前服以「耐而斯遺精片」三粒，則不能任何重篤之遺精，滑精，神經衰弱，發育不全，腎虧陰痿等症，無不藥到病除，　「補體康」分男女用兩種，其女用爲卵巢內分泌製劑，有調經種子之功，</p>
<h3>治肺之要着</h3>
<p>— 盛在強醫師</p>
<p>肺臟爲一無知覺之臟器，故其爲癆菌侵入，毫不知覺，雖侵蝕成爲空洞，亦無特異痛苦，惟癆菌犯及肋膜發生肋膜炎，則有胸部刺痛之感，或則因肋膜炎而至胸腔蓄水，或則因結核腦膜炎而至斃命，故治療肺病，一方應注意攝養，如空氣之流通，日光之充足，對於飲食，尤應攝取富有滋養而易以消化之食品。並應忌食烟酒等刺激品，而其主要方面，尤應昭以肺病特效藥，「補肺拿爾」，以增生肺部石灰質，殺滅癆菌，由是則肺病無論至飼期，亦得根本全治，因此，「補肺拿爾」得能風行各國，實非偶然之事也</p>
<p>淋病春秋</p>
<h3>淋毒的大肅清</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士　黃仲昌醫師</p>
<p>淋毒因其傳染性極爲强大，故蔓延極速，社會上不論窮富，均有淋病患者，混跡其間也。即此一點，足可目淋菌貽害人類之大矣。關於淋病的歷史，並非現在才有，而是和人類同具悠長之歷史，故其爲害於人類者甚大。而結果終未有方法去征服牠。說起淋病之病源菌，其生存力有値得先行說明者。蓋淋毒菌，乃一繁殖力極速之細菌，其形有如雙球相疊，故名雙球菌，凡是有吾人之患者，多不在淋菌之本身，而在淋菌所產生之毒素，浸潤粘膜，因而發炎腫痛，結果遂發生具體的淋病，更因淋菌投奔各處，即在其處發生種種病變，此淋病變症之所由來也。要根治淋病，殺菌固然必要，而肅淸淋菌之毒素，亦爲不可忽略之事。</p>
<p>要達到此等根本解決淋病之目的，非用殺菌抗淋淸毒之淋菌法不爲功。要達此目的，又非採用最新法發明之淋病特效藥不爲功也，余以經騐所得，德國彼德博士最新發明之淋病特效藥一新克淋儂」一藥。因此劑係根據最新化學療法之精良成分，提去有反應之雜質，用科學方法製成，服用之後，能使淋病患者，自動發生一種抗淋淸毒作用，並有鎮痛之功。故凡初起之急性淋病，前尿道發炎，及炎症蔓延後部尿道而人後尿道炎，復分途侵入生殖器，泌尿器，血液等處，而發生攝護腺炎，睪丸炎，膀胱炎等服「新克淋儂」均能治愈。</p>

<h3>尿道淋之前因後果</h3>
<p>— 姚菊巖醫師撰</p>
<p>診所：寗波路</p>
<p>九號四川路口</p>
<p>一染淋病，其初之淋菌，類多寄生於前尿道，此時如果以迅雷不及掩耳之法，將淋菌加以掃蕩，則未獲據點之淋菌，自無從掙扎，而一網打盡，惟是，如果此時而不極力消滅此種病菌，則一切病變均由此而起。大扺前尿道之淋菌，淋病之前驅期中常見之。及由前驅而入急性期，則淋菌已不侷促於前尿道而且跨入後尿道，一切變症，更見增多，而治療上亦較前驅症爲難。淋菌在前尿道所發生之淋病，其易扑滅之原因，爲因前尿道生理上無複雜的搆造。所以治療起來，很是容易，如過淋菌巳侵入後尿道，治療上雖較難，但如其淋菌尙未侵襲泌尿器系，內生殖器系，血液循環系。根治猶不甚難，但如果已成淋毒性膀胱炎，攝護腺炎，睪丸炎，關節炎等症，是無異表明患者之淋病已侵入此等系統。其治療上不但較前尿道炎爲難，卽後尿道炎亦困難多矣。凡此等等，都是淋毒尿道炎失治之前因後果。而惟一之療法，祗有服用淋病特效藥化學療法「新克淋儂」（太和，永安公司均售）始有肅淸之望。因淋菌如其自前尿道。迄分散三大系統之淋菌，範圍廣大，絕對不能用一枝一節之局部手術，可以完成驅淋之任務也。余更輔用德國靜電療法，使「新克淋儂」殺菌力允能發揮盡致　診時：上午十時至下午六時。自卽日起每日送診廿號。每號僅取號金五角並送價値一元之「性病全書」一册。</p>

<h3>上海物價飛漲的癥結和對策</h3>
<p>— 陶公文</p>
<p>從日常生活中，誰都感到物價在不斷壓迫着；今年二月比去年同月的上海市工人生活費，已平均增加了三倍弱。物價高漲程度，亦可想見。</p>
<p>上海巿工人生活費指數表</p>
<p>上海物價飛漲，直接受到壓迫的，是上海的平民；可是當內地必需品的一部分，還要上海供給的時候，內地人民也免不了受上海物價飛漲的間接壓迫；因此是本市物價的暴漲，雖不給給予我國國策以一種嚴重的打擊，至少也會予以相當的不利影響；所以不僅上海的平民和地方當局，深盼物價趨於合理的水準，而應採取必要的措置，就是我們的最高當局，對於上海物價的在漲，想也不致於漢不關心。</p>
<p>要平抑上海的物價，就得先硏究牠猛漲的原因。關於物價猛漲的原因，由於各人的觀點不同，主張亦各異；歸納起來，似有下面三種主張：</p>
<p>（一）法幣巳呈過度膨脹，故購買力慘跌；</p>
<p>（二）因上海環境的特殊，輸入上海的貨物數量激减；</p>
<p>（三）投機盛行對貨物的需要數量激增。</p>
<p>我們先來檢討，法幣是不是眞巳呈着過度膨脹？據重慶一月十七日電，中中交農四行的法幣發行額為三·〇八一·七八七·二九五元；較「八·一三」戰事爆發時的發行額一·五一一·七一四·六四二元；的增加一倍，但就全國來看，我國法幣的實際流通額，因為左列原因，沒有增加得像發行額那麼多：</p>
<p>（一）增發的法幣中，有一部分是代替所收回的省鈔和銀幣；</p>
<p>（二）實際上有一部分法幣，巳燬於砲火，或者己經散失，再也不會流通於市面的；</p>
<p>（三）因為在非常時期中銀行所保留的存款準備金，比昇平時代，來得充實；充這存款準備金的法幣，除非發生擠提風潮，吾則決不會流到社會上來；</p>
<p>（四）現在銀行的放款政策，比平時格外穩重，以是放款的機會，相對地減少，在收進的存款中，除保留一部份，充作存款準備金外，依舊有一部分不能放出去，死擱在庫房裏；</p>
<p>（五）銀行的存戶，受了二次限制提存的敎訓，都怕政府第三次限制提存，寗可冒些風險，多留些現鈔在手頭，因此死攔在人民銀箱或錢囊裏的法幣數量，也較平時增加了。</p>
<p>發行額並非就是流通額，由於上述幾個原因，又可見發行額並未過於膨脹，外加各地交通不便，貿易稀少，各地金融調節機構的失去常態；他的流通速度以及流通量，更談不到膨脹。不過這是就全國而言；惟就本市言，情形比較不同。因為除了法幣外，還有其他通貨，例如支票·匯票·匯劃票據等；尤要者；淪陷區和香港等地的資金，多漸集中上海；又不做合理的投資；任其浮游市面，所以在流通量方面，較前似膨脹了不少；這似無可諱言的。但這還不是重要原因。假使牠和貨物的供需維持着平衡關係，換句話說：牠的流通速度確能和正常的商業交易量維繫着平衡關係，那末道通貨數量的增加，正是巿面繁榮中應有的現象。這樣我們應檢討上海貨物的供需關係了。當廣州汕頭廈門等地先後淪陷後，上海的貨物供給，確曾發生過恐慌。現在呢，受了上海高物價的引誘，淪陷區和內地供給上海的貨物數量，事實上或許已比前大為增加。就運輸條件上說；我國沿海交通仍無激烈變化，國際運輸，且因海戰的鬆弛化而反潤滑些。英美等國的貨物，仍是源源而來。所成問題的，凡由淪陷區來的貨物，都要先經過某方的支配。這種支配，無疑的便是貨物　增漲的直接原因之一。</p>
<p>上海本來是我國最大的投機市塲，尤其在國家的統治力，在上海暫時失去地位的今日，投機風氣，益形旺熾。迨歐戰發生後，我國逃往香港的黃金，隨淪陷區資金的集中上海，而重返滬巿，據八日本報載；上海的游資至少在三十萬萬元以上，其中百分之五十為各銀行的活期存款，百分之十投資於滬西的新興事業，其餘百分之四十多是過剩的資金，流入投機的一途。何况各銀行裏所擁的活期存款，至少也有一半可以流為投機的。投機的主要對象是（一）囤積日用必需品，像米，粉，煤，布疋，（二）買賣外滙和外幣，（三）買賣黃金，（四）買賣股票，公　票，（五）經營匯劃貼水和套利。由於投機風氣大熾的緣故，對貨物的需要，呈現小合理的激增，雖然洋米大量進口，米價仍保持着上漲的姿態，煤的存底尙厚，但煤價還是漲，這顯然證明投機者在作祟，使貨物的供求失去平衡。</p>
<p>總括起來說：最近上海物價飛漲的癥結是本市通貨量相當的膨脹，貨物來源的被壟斷，和各種投機的盛行。但我們要目前可能實施的抑價政策，也許只有收縮本市的通貨數量，管理本市的資金活動；和取締投機行為，使貨物的供求平衡。</p>
<p>收縮上海的通貨數量，確是一件不容易的事，在現狀下，上海還不失為資余的「安樂窠」，各方面的游資，像潮水般的流向上海來，要使上海的游資减少，必須建立比上海更好的投資塲所，而後本埠的游資，才會向那邊流去。那末更好的投資塲所應建立在什麼地方呢？不容說，當然是我國的西南和西北了，最高當局早巳制定人民投資內地建設事業的優待辦法，給予投入內地的資金，鞏固的保障，和優　的利息。但上海的游資，還是停留在上海，因此要使上海游資少作一些孿，眼看銀錢業當局自行管理其資金運用的一途。如提高放款拆息，限制押放等等。</p>
<p>講到投機行為的取締，在眼前特殊環境下，單靠政府的命令和地方當局的佈吿，恐難見效，還要靠同業公會和銀錢業的合作。投機者應得的報應，不久以後，固然就會降臨到他們的身上，可是在他們還有由於事實的敎訓，澈底覺悟，仍醉心於投機行為的時候，同業間應互相制止業內人的投機，及業外人從事於本業的投機，銀錢業在放款的時候，除了考慮借款人的信用之外，還應調査款子的用途；如果擔心資金放不去，我以為寗可减低存款利息；或者由銀錢業來推行平民生活費的信用合作。最好的還是自動地找尋投資內地的途徑。至於同業公會，現在着手取締投機行為的有機製煤球業同業公會，麵粉廠同業會；銀錢業亦提高放款利率，防止借款囤貨的投機，我們希望其他同業公會也一致起來制止投機，並且採取比較現在上述兩同業公會所採取的，更有效，更嚴密的防止手段。同時我們對於兩租界當局的平抑物價計劃與決心，更寄以極大之期望。</p>
<p>重慶市之物價</p>
<p>據西南經濟硏究所調査：戰爭以來重慶巿之物價，激漲不已，關於食料品方面之增漲情形，有如次表：</p>
<p>（註）廿六·七年為六月份平均價；廿八年係十一月份平均價。單位元。</p>
<h3>物價飛漲和平衡物價問題</h3>
<p>— 劉直之</p>
<p>中國目下各地物價的一般原因，究竟在那裏呢？槪括言之，恐怕不出下面各點罷：</p>
<p>（一）外滙黑市塲的成立。黑巿塲活動的結果，使外滙下跌，促使進口物價上漲，因之間接提高了一部分的國貨價格。</p>
<p>（二）生產减少。戰區擴大，生產自受影響而减少。縱使猶能工作者，亦皆限於環境關係而不能大量生產。</p>
<p>（三）供需的失調。在今日，中國的工商業，一方面耽不能作大規模的製造和多量生產以供諸社會，一方面又因人民對於物質生活的享受，未曾因節的而减少，如斯，對於供需二方面，自不得謂為平衡，而在此求過於供的境况下，則物價焉得而不為之增貴？</p>
<p>（四）運輸困難和沿途稅險的加重。交通的不方便使物價失其調劑的均衡者，這在中國已往固已成為一大嚴重問題，況乎今日，遭到侵略者的多方巳有不少工商業的重要地段，先後淪為戰區，把持和種種留難，因此對於運輸調節上，自屬險阻頗多，荊棘環生，而且欲自甲地運送貨物到乙地的時候，沿途上所遭逢不測的風險，更多莫可預計者，這樣，工商業品於冒絕頂危險以後，對於其出賣價格，便大大提高</p>
<p>（五）來源的被統制與缺乏。關於這方面，固為目下一般物價飛漲的重要原因之一，而且又是一個最値得人們重視的點子。因為在中國巳淪陷的如許地域中，固多着為工商業原料的生產地，但是在今日為對方佔據以後，自非拚命的掠奪，甚且全部的予以壟斷不可，如此則物品來源自將稀少，而物價亦就安得不貴呢？證之去年暑期以前上海荳油巿塲價格飛漲猛抬的情形，全國各地新穀登塲以後的上海米糧價格，非惟不見减低，倒反日有扒上，凡此種種，便是因為大荳和食米被日方特別注目，加以全部分禁止運滬後的結果。</p>
<p>（六）商人的囤積居奇，故意操縱。關於這點，確屬促使目下各地物價所以增漲的原因之一。尤其在今日中國政治勢力不能達到的上海，所表現出來的情形更為可怕。</p>
<p>（七）人口集中一隅的關係。人口的集聚一隅，致使物價因以飛漲這個原因，表現於上海埠者，便屬一大顯例。</p>
<p>（八）市場心理的搖動不定。至於市場心理所以搖動不定的原因，也是完全由於少數有力量的工商業者，散布許多故炫社會人士耳目的無稽讕言，希圖乘此操縱巿面，以遂其個人無厭的利慾。</p>
<p>此外，又如以若干銀錢業之收受物品為抵押而放款等種種舉動，其性質等於圃積及其他方面物品生產成本之增貴等原因，要皆與今日百物價格的飛漲，不無有其相當的連帶關係。</p>
<p>平抑物價諸方案</p>
<p>國內物價無限制的繼長增高不已的結果，必影響及國民購買力之削弱，若任令此漲風無巳，不謀阻抑之道，則直接間接地均將造成國民生活的嚴重恐慌，亦將促致社會秩序的不安定和治安的無法維持。</p>
<p>不過，中國政府對於戰時的物價，雖早存有統制的決心，但終限於環境，因為，在物價的統制政策方面，於歐美各工業先進國家，因多所實行而收效者，然而我國係一農業國，無論於政治經濟等各方面，均與外國不同，並且又因缺少精確詳盡的統計關係，對於外國採用的方法，自屬未便援引，而且縱使倣效以實行之，恐亦未能有若多成效可見也。那麼對於常前平衡物價問題所可採納的幾點實施辦法，自然物價及取締投機操縱辦法，並通令各地組織平價委員會，以負担起平定人民日常生活必需品的價裕。並且，在這次政府所頒布平價的辦法中，又規定了値得我人引致的三項標準，就是那：（一）凡物品之生產及運銷成本，未受戰事影響或影響甚微者，以戰前三年或一年之平均價為準。（二）凡物品之生產及運銷成本，受戰事影響者，以其在戰後之成本再加當之利潤為標準。（三）凡物品之成本不易計算者，以其經營所　之資本總額，再加相當之利潤為標準，並規定平衡物價之物品以日　必需品為限。</p>
<p>至於平衡物價委員會的組織係由地方政府及省銀行和地方銀行，以及各地的商會和同業公會等共同組織之，其責職乃在評定對於人民日常生活必需品的出賣價格，而且又規定了違反此項標準的條例計三項，凡遇有觸犯此三項的條例者，得向法院提出檢舉云。</p>
<p>不過，在上海這地方，因為環境上的特殊，當然對於遵奉了政府所頒布的法令外，更不能不勉力竭盡下列的各點，如此，則對於平衡物價問題的前途曙光，定有希望。</p>
<p>（一）兩租界當局會同全市各公團同業公會並社會有力份子。迅速成立强有力之平衡物價委員會，以資相互研討出最有成效的統制物價方案。</p>
<p>（二）對於日常生活必需品方面的幾種物類，如米麵煤球等，應責令各該同業公會並轉飭各會員行家，不得再事非法越軌授受，以免有操會囤積之嫌。如有不遵令者，當移付全體公議懲戒，並受法院最高嚴厲之處役或罰金。</p>
<p>（三）對於各該物品原設有調節協會者，更應加强其內部之組織，並對外執行其應有之責權</p>
<p>（四）謹希銀錢業兩界各份子，能移付鉅額資金，墊交並會同社會各公團，作向外訂購鉅額的生活必需品，以擴大並持久平糶的範圍和時日，俾進一步的加惠於羣生。</p>
<p>（五）謹希各報館以及凡為人民言論之喉舌機關，竭盡輿論監督並多方謀有以揭破種種陰謀，內中實情，使每一奸商，皆心知有謹愼從事的戒心。</p>
<p>（六）全體公民為本和衷共濟，勞資協謀，團結合作，鎭定着一切，以應付大變的來臨。如此，免為親者所痛，仇者所快。</p>
<p>此外，對於平衡物價的又一方面，並希各界能於人民生活必需品方面的各類物品，除確立一公定的價格和統制消費，並必須强制人民遵行外，更當注重生產方面的大量增加和溝通運輸工作。並且，應當曉喩人民大家能够自動起來節的消費，愛惜物類，以期調節物品的供需於均衡，而使物價不致再上漲。</p>
<h3>美日五金貿易</h3>
<p>— 王一之</p>
<p>五金為主要軍需工業原料；然日本對於此項原料之供給，唯海外之輸入者是賴；而允以來自美國者居多。美日現巳在無商的時代，日本軍需工業之原料問題尤堪注意者矣。</p>
<p>據美方宣布日方為作戰需要，最近仰給於美之重要原料所占成數，巳如下表。由前表觀之。日本經濟上以至作戰能力上之依賴於美國之深，巳不言而喩。試再一述美日五金貿易之情形。惟自中日戰事發生後，日本政府對於有關軍需工業之各種原料材料等等重要貨品之進口數字，即秘而不宣。故其實際情形，祇可由戰前之狀態中推想之。</p>
<p>由下表觀之：當時日本之此項原料，似尙不全部仰給於美國。但歐戰旣起，則其原有之供給者，皆不得不轉而供應自用，或為歐洲交戰國就近搜購。因此日本捨美國外別無來源。商業新聞</p>

<h3>滬戰後之呢絨業</h3>
<p>— 茂芳</p>
<p>（一）引言</p>
<p>上海呢絨業、自「八一三」後變遷頗巨、姑特彙誌如左、當「八三滬戰開始、滬上呢絨業全數停業、直至九月一日方始復業、（西服帮　市較早）、十月初旬、全數正式營業、蓋是時尙為初期抗戰、階段人心不免相當動盪、不若目前因抗戰愈久、而愈形穩固也、</p>
<p>（二）抗戰中上海呢絨業之損失</p>
<p>「八一三」滬戰初起、呢絨同業中、莫不大形恐慌、尤以虹口區者為甚、雖早數日多有遷避、然貨物自未能全數起出、以致除極小數者外、無一不大受損失二十六年底總結束、除營業額大見减少外、對於賬目一項、均未能　期照揭、本外埠放賬、統扯　得對　光景、其他如呢絨織造廠、因廠址多在華界及虹口區、故有數家、損失亦屬不貲、</p>
<p>（三）畸形發展下之呢絨</p>
<p>然至二十七年三月、市况突然大變、貨價無一不節節飛漲、其主要原因、（一）政府實施滙兌統制、致成本驟高、（二）到貨缺乏、且因孤島人口激增、需要旺盛、致呢絨業在畸形發展之下亦成求過於供之象、行情步漲不已、其中以國貨呢絨、更為暢銷俏俐、</p>
<p>（四）業內外投機之勃興</p>
<p>自上海成為孤島、人口加增以來、各種事業、莫小畸形發達、於是呢絨一項遂亦為囤戶所注意、相率出資、從事投機、吸收搜買、不遺餘力、更有運用擒縱手段、以圖操縱市面、坐獲鉅利、良以滬上情形特別、故呢絨運銷、仍不失其為總樞紐也、其他如貨物進出一律現鈔、本地小機戶突增、貨運多取道香港海防溫州金華等處、以及運往內地口岸、因防劣貨朦混、檢査綦嚴、則尤為戰事以後發生之事跡、</p>

<h3>勸種番薯</h3>
<p>閩中山多田少，民間所恃爲糧食之資者，半在番薯，其種來自舶上，相傳明代始有之。旱田隙地，以及山坡環抝之區，可以容鋤者，皆得下種。計一日之力，可飽半月之糧。閩廣等處最多，浙民間有種者。汝州、魯山、嵩縣等，已有種傅入；汴之市中，亦經見之，但弗碩大，若得其種法，則自蕃滋矣。按豫之士性多疎，種番薯最相宜。番薯一名地瓜，豫人呼爲紅薯。閩廣舊有此種。形圓，長數寸，皮紅色，肉白色，近年自文來國舶上傳入新種，形圓，皮白色，肉黃色，俱有乳獎蔓生，其根入地生薯，質潤味甘，無毒性，補中益氣，益脾强陰，與薯芓同功，足當糧食。南方地暖，正月即將薯頭或舊籐枝入地，用力壅灌，使枝節易長，春分即可分籐揷種。豫省當於解凍後，和煦時出種，看苗長大分種。南方五六月間，有種晚薯，無不俱獲其利。早薯則於五六月後，漸决挖取，霜降前，盡取收藏。薯性宜高地，地肥者可不用糞培。園地旱田大選者，歲前以大糞壅之。或地非沙土，則先用柴灰牛馬糞和勻，使土脈散緩。食用可煎食，可蒸食，可煨食，可煮食，可切片晒乾煮食，亦可生食。有磨細徵盼，作餅餌等物。蒸熟伴麵造酒，亦香美。一畝之地，可取七八十石，數口之家，可以無飢矣</p>

<h3>景長虹輪慘案中「旅行」的敎訓</h3>
<p>— 張孟昭</p>
<p>不上高山，不得知平地好走路！不登旅程，怎知道涉水渡海之苦？所以俗語說：「出門一里，不如家裏，」然而，男兒志在四方，又豈能株守家園我，坐井觀天呢？</p>
<p>這一次，甬埠景昇小駁輪的沉沒慘劇，罹難者達兩百餘人，，號哭之聲，不絕於耳，眞是旅行中慘絕塵寰之事。這件慘案的造成，固由於駁輪的主事者太不注意於限制載重了，而旅客們爭先登輪的慌亂，和不守秩序，更沒有機警的智慧，避免浩刧，亦大可扼腕。</p>
<p>只有「死裏逃生者　某君，倒非常「機警」而善於「應變」。讀他的報吿文，而可知，據他說：「……二日按即本月二日）午後　時，即往碼頭候駁輪，是時，乘客已擁擠不堪，待駁輪景昇號靠埠，用平生之力，挨進該輪，約半小時，忽聞警報大作，見一日機，從空掠過，恐發生意外，該輪急解纜起椗，船漸漸離岸，尙有多數乘客，不及登駁輪，於是紛粉雇舢舨駁向景昇號小輪，船伕以竹竿，一端有鐵鈞，鈞住景昇輪使乘客攀登上輪，一時輪小人多，該輪並被船伕用鈞鈎住，以致船身倒斜，下艙漸漸浸下，……見勢不佳，急葉行李，跳下另舢舨，令其速向岸搖去？……七岸回視該輪，祇見水上一烟囱矣……」云云。</p>
<p>這篇報吿文，作者署名是「死裏逃生者」眞眞名符其實，然而他見機而作」的機智頭腦，和登陸爲安」的應變行動，值得大家佩服的。</p>
<p>從這次景昇輪慘案中，所獲得「旅行」的敎訓，是見機警，不爭先，不慌亂，寗可讓後，不必急急，急則方寸已亂，臨變極速，更安所措手足？像「死裏逃生者」的某君，能够見勢不佳，急棄行李，跳下另一舢舨，是其臨危不亂，應變受讓方　，得慶更生的由來。所以像「泛宅為家」的旅行人，第一要細心，第二要機警，細心與機警，不但是在旅途上，應該俱備的條件，即用之春他事物上，也是終身受用無窮呢。</p>
<h3>楊草仙的老布單衣</h3>
<p>— 孫籌成</p>
<p>擅書法之白二老人楊草仙先生雖年逾百齡，而精神矍鑠，所穿之衣，主寬大摘體，而不求美觀；內衣則力避出汗，抱定「汗出除病，汗入受病」的兩句國醫格言，一遇出汗，立即更換，不使汗衣着體，而侵及毛孔血管，外衣則志在禦寒，抱定「布衣暖三字秘訣，式樣不趨時髦，質地不喜綢緞，不論春夏秋冬，外面必罩一件老布單衣，腰身與袖口之大，異乎尋常，幾與道十所穿之法衣相仿，習以爲常。昨在華女大厦金門大酒店春宴，渠穿了這件老布單衣，往來奔走，招待來賓，甚形忙碌。人皆詢其穿布衣之主旨，他說衣好衣歹，與我無關，滬上雖只重衣衫不重人，但予無求於人，鬻字自給，我行我素，還是穿老布單衣的舒適。現在百物飛漲，做一件好點衣服，要耗三五難胞的一年生活費用，甚不値得，不僅失却別人的生命，幷且欲失却我自己的性命。我賣字的所入，向來分三部分用途，（一）救濟難胞，（二）酬謝，苟能衣食無憂，已覺不易，安敢再求美麗之衣服，而圖一人之時髦。經在座同人，將其所言硏究後，得有下列之批評，預備寫一橫額贈與，以留紀念，略謂布衣傲王侯，遺世而獨立，美其名曰高尙，然非矯情，即怪僻，揆之人類共同生存之原則，似未恰到好處，戒奢崇德的老布單衣，偉人亦尙之，有一班吝嗇鬼與守財奴，不在此例，須得界限分明，貧賤人穿老布衣，是迫於環境使然，他在國外寫一字，曾得二萬元之　資，可稱點石成金，富埒王侯，而亦如是儉樸，的確難能可貴。今日在此宴客，便是實行共三種用途之第二項，希望其對於第一項用途，仍照過去之辦法，則亦不必再勸其做衣，乃能貫澈其第三項用途之主張。</p>
<h3>閒話構膠車胎</h3>
<p>— 小郎</p>
<p>橡膠車胎，如黃包車人力車等，它是交通工具副屬用品之一，在十餘年以前，用於市上的，完全是舶來品，根據江海關十餘年以前的報吿，每年的輸入約在四五千萬元之間，漏巵之大，說也驚人。後來有葉振明恩溥昆仲，集合朱良甫等熱心實業同志，創辦大同實業公司，製造三元牌車胎行銷於世，此爲國產車胎之嚆矢，隨之大中華義生等相機產生，不過他們主要的營業是膠鞋等，車胎祇是出品中副屬之一，較之大同微有不同。車胎的原料，是，膠鋅春粉，炭酸鎂，密陀僧，硫磺，墨灰，促進劑，立德粉，帆布等等，（恕不贅錄），大抵車胎之是否堅靱耐用，必須選擇優良的帆布，這是唯一的必要條件，次之膠粉的混合，壓力的平均，也是應當注意的，葉君等曾經努力研究，幾經挫折，終不灰心到目前已達到，國資，國料，國人製造的目的，因之市上一切舶來品遂告絕跡，每年减少了入超的數字，在提倡國貨聲中，努力生產，就是增加抗戰的力量，確是興奮的椿事。</p>
<p>目前滬上黃句車約一萬輛，自由車約三十餘萬輛，根據私人方面的調查所得，已有十分之六，採用三元牌車胎。白從國府西遷之後，西南西北的公路，突飛猛進，交通工具，需用殊殷，副屬品的供給，草不竭力採用國貨，甚至南洋羣島等地，亦紛向國內探詢國產車胎的情形可以反映國難聲中，已驚醒了國人，大家都願盡應用國貨的天職。（不受酬）</p>
<h3>國際聯盟諸事高貴無匹之衣食住行</h3>
<p>— 天眼支郎</p>
<p>「國聯」自其名義言，乃爲超乎各國政府以上之政治集團。理事會一歲四開，平日夙以淸幽淡雅　之瑞士名城日內瓦，忽於此佳日，燦爛生光輝，變作濃妝之西子。予姑不問諾理事之事權能力各如何，予又不暇細算會前會後飛機與特等車之坐臥遊樂各何如，若僅一言大小四會間理事諸公起居怡養之優隆，眞不愧爲全世界獨一無二之太上仙府。國不論其當與貧。人民不問多與寡，惟此『福星』轉世之理事生涯，不僅爲全世界最少數人所能嘗試，且或爲全世界最少數人所得詳知。予今揭開神秘，各記一詩，進而餉我怕花錢而望門却步之國內同胞，或將如書餅充飢之喻，博得精神上一時之快慰歟。</p>
<p>其一咏衣　一塵不染中條白。雙翦于飛外表寬。緩帶垂裳從所欲。烟波無恙慶彈冠。注曰。『國節』爲典型外交大員聚首之塲，英國爲典型成衣匠產生之地，衣必越海得諸央，章其美也。俄國在歐戰後，內儘多著破衣之人，而出席日內瓦之首席代表，仍御全套嶄新一日數更之上品冠履，好在出差開公帳，本人不必解襄也。其以外交大員預禮餐，或參夜會者，自必改御燕尾服，俾得倍增道貌之雍容。世界即便有風波，橫豎是鬧不到日內瓦。阿比西尼亞國中灰燼，西班牙遍地烽烟，其國外交大員，轉因于役國聯，而得策勳壇玷。首席代表之地位可貴，首席代表更換衣服之時晷，自更可貴，白領白襯衫與白圍巾，居『中』一『條』直下，貴乎有不染織塵之『白』。而晨夕休息間緩帶垂裳新沐彈冠之享樂，『從心所欲』，益壽怡神，更爲當代外交大員自致『淸靜頭腦』與『冲遠襟度』之無上妙訣，孔子必年至七十而始從心所欲，何其晚也。</p>
<p>其二咏食　美酒如泉仙史會。百靈作膳五龍賓。而今始識　槃重。吹氣如蘭萬彙春。</p>
<p>註曰。日內瓦乃縮小之巴黎，嘉肴美酒，舉世所珍。沿白山卡Quai　du　Mont-Blanc諸大食堂之拿手菜，品類之繁雜與色香味之美倫豐贍，恐罄十年之學力，尙不能悉數闡解其得名之來歷。外交之名詞淸簡，而庖廚之術語反甚艱深，以辜鴻銘之博學，而嘗因不識菜單文字，見譏於西餐之侍者，（事見上年十月三十日申報本攔，）甚矣食之易而知之靴也。予今姑取分量較輕薄之美津館Hotel　Beau-Riveage中午小餐菜單，一加迻譯，比諸一九三七年聖誕節漢上嘗火雞之蔣委員長伉儷，似已加上幾倍之口福。　他豪舉，美小勝收，『不是個中人，無以盡其妙，』直類彼山君之賓五龍而膳百靈。而在第二道大葷既畢之時，此輩飽飫「國餐』之『五大』『衆小』諸理事，如有幾人在座，恒當衆作不寬不緊而又不歸正傳之短套俏皮演說，酒肉香騰之繡口甫閉，而鼓掌聲繼之以興，不問八節或四時，而均有壺裏洞春之樂。美哉日內瓦，深得新式外交葆愛和平之旨矣。特錄小餐菜單一則如下式。</p>
<p>其三咏住　拂檻流波海樣明。排雲高樹起秋聲。萬金一刻承平樂。紅葉亭階傲晚榮。註曰。瑞士行旅我備之佳，恒令。興觀止之歎，然又非一到即行之遠客所易明知。至論國聯費用之奢，若併各國會費及總代表經費合計外，恐一刻鐘集會之代價，尙不止華幣萬金。</p>
<p>其四咏行　嫩晴湖上數雲槎。叫海秋風共一家。緩緩淸陰動星斾。白山橋外日初斜。註曰。白山橋兩岸行館林立，及午而車蓋絡繹，車前揷有色明艷之小國族者，乃總代表之專備車也，一橋之隔，不可徒行，威儀峻爽，有古大夫之遺風焉。</p>
<h3>一星期經濟菜單</h3>
<p>— 華美女士</p>
<p>菜花，似乎是一種貴族化的菜疏，因為大小筵席中，常有它的地位，而西餐中也往往用得着它的。但是近來菜花的價格，倒也不怎樣昂貴，一毛錢也可以買到小小的一顆了。就爲的價格不算貴，所以我這經濟菜單中，也要請它來參加一下，葷的做法，無論炒蝦仁，炒腰子，皆很可口，但是蝦仁腰子，皆嫌太貴，所以還是拿來炒炒猪肉片或猪肉丁，比較的經濟一些，幷且可以不用醬油，要是多放些湯，很可泡飯吃，淸雋得很。至於索的做法，可以加人素十景，倘若弄些竹筍花菰來一塊兒炒，更可在素筵席中占席哩。</p>

<h3>同舟共濟</h3>
<p>編者先生：近日本戰載着，××第三紗廠怠工的事，實在是孤島上不安全的象徵，尤以近來工潮更形熱熾，推其癥結，當然受物價高漲，囤積居奇的影響。在此地受着奸商重重剝削下的工人們，旣不是爲了擾亂秩序，却正爲了嚴守秩序，所以發出一個合理的要求。他們因爲連最起碼的生活—即一粥一飯亦難以支持，試問工人　天出了勞力，費了汗血，再不加油（食糧），怎能做呢？</p>
<p>不過做老闆的太殘忍了，曾經對工人們說：「除非你們餓死，這里有一千多只麻袋，預備一齊把你們拋到江里去。」這種人眞是太自私自利的了。</p>
<p>那天（十一日）起，廠方重仃登記，換句話，就是整批開除工人，試想這一批完全被開除的人，將何以待之，假如有鋌而走險，豈非促成社會的不安嗎？因敬吿各界，主持正義，並希勸導資方，開誠備公地來處理這事件。我認爲此時此地，大家只有本着精誠合作下去，民族工人有得吃，才後能做。</p>

<h3>美金票的買賣</h3>
<p>— 張鎭山</p>
<p>在報上看到買賣美金票的廣吿，據說只要預付一點保證金，即可隨時從事買賣。在美金票已昂到十五元五角的今日，居然有這種商號發現，眞覺得上海的發財機會的確太多了，太容易了。</p>
<p>雖然，我明曉得事實上是不會這樣簡單，我也無意想在美金票上發點橫財，但道一門業務在上海尙係創聞，爲了明瞭究竟起見，我於是冒作了一决要買美金票的顧客。討來一份章程，一讀，二讀，三讀之一後，尙有若干部份含糊其詞的不十分明瞭，再經面詢一下，所謂「佣金利息低廉」……等始全部通過了腦神經。</p>
<p>譬如：你準備購買一百元美金票，祇須預付保證金二百元。以目前十五元五角的市價計算，要一千五百五十元方可購買，而現在只要付出二百元即可，表面上似乎很便宜，其實呢？並不這樣簡單，除保證金二百元外，尙有佣金一分，利息一分半，計算方法如下：假定購買美金票一百元，以法幣的折合價，除去保證金二百元，即等於透支一千三百五十元，此一千三百五十元，每兀須繳納利息一分半，佣金一分，合計要三十三元七角五分，實際上就是等於出二分半的利率，向他們貸款購買美金票。到一個月期滿，假使美金票與法幣的折合價不動的話，那末，你一個月三十三元七角五分的支出，就得如「啞子吃黃連，有苦說不出」。即使折合價於你有利的上昇，也至少每元要上昇到三角四分以上，方不颳本。我們以過去的情形來作根據，美金票的價格雖上昇了不少，但並不是驟然間的上昇，它是逐漸上昇的。假使你一個月一個月的等下去，也許有一日會實現你的理想上昇若干，但是把這一個月一個月的利息支出一相抵，賺錢的並不是「你」，而是「他」了。至於美金票的折合價下跌呢？那來你有保證金作抵，虧損到十分之五時，此項美金票的處置權就屬於他們。</p>
<p>我們有句俗語叫做「眼珠是黑的銀子是白的」，那些投機商人的所以操縱市面，就在滿足他們「白銀」的慾望；但是一般人也放棄了正當的營業，想去博取不義之財，那又落了我們的俗語「貓嘴裏挖鰍」，難乎其難了！更何况他們投機事業的基礎是建築在那樣脆弱的機會上面！</p>
<h3>文憑的買賣</h3>
<p>— （崙）</p>
<p>我有一位同學，他上學期還在高中二年級讀書，寒假過後，忽然地考進了大學，變做大學生了！不過是一個私立大學的學生。</p>
<p>據我所知：私立大學招考新生是沒有「相當程度」，非要有高中文憑方可入學。所以我看見那位同學考進了大學，覺得十二分的奇怪；過後一打聽，才知道他是化一百多元在一家中擊裏買來了一張文憑。這種跨越式的敎育，在學生方面沒有良好的結果，是母庸多說的，然而所可奇怪的，却是居然還有這種「賣文憑」的學校。</p>
<p>按學校是學生們受敎育的地方，不是製造「資格」的地方，當然，更不是出賣「資格」的地方。如今竟有學校大胆的出賣文憑，那末這種學校簡直可以改成商店，改成賣文憑的商店。這也許是因爲處在孤島上沒有直接的敎育機關來管束，於是那班學校的校長就「利慾薰心」，「隨所欲爲」罷。最後，我希望敎育界當局知道這種賣文憑的學校後，望給予一個嚴厲的制裁！</p>
<h3>雨過天青</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第廿一回　理經綸混合纖維質　興機械佐成文字功</p>
<p>吳君素道：『爲什麼那一架機器印出來的戰，一定要運到那一省去？難道每一架機器印出來的報，各有不同，所以要分開界限來嗎？』邵慧華道：「非也。這也不過是便於運輸罷了。機器上印出報來以後，直接輸送到上層的打包間。譬如浙江省機器上印出來的報，送到上層打包間，而這個打包間，便是專鬥打到浙江一路裏去的。打好包，貼好簽條，立刻由滑車送到卡車上。這卡車早停好在打包間的門口，一裝完了，便立刻送到滬浙路上去了。這是何等便捷的事；不然，那秩序便要亂了。浙江省的報如此，別的省份的報，也是如此。不過其中也要分出火車報，飛機報。因爲運報的卡車，也都規定的。火車報裝上卡車，直開往火車站去。飛機報裝上卡車，直開到飛機塲去。所以我們運報的卡車，也都和機器上一樣，各各健明的。』天君素道：「原來如此。那末你們早晨運送報紙，就要不少卡車吧？』邵慧華道：「也不多！現在我們有運報專用卡車三十輛。但近來還覺得不大敷用，已新定了十輛，舊的替換下來，也可以供別樣使用呀！』吳君素道。『那末本市的報紙怎樣呢？當然不必上打包間的了。」邵慧華道：『呀！本市的報最多，你瞧那邊一大排的機器，全是印本市報的。雖然用不着打包，也是輸送向上層去的，那上層是個發行室。看報的人都是以先睹爲快，報紙一離開機器，便要立刻送給人看了。』哭君素道：『可惜你們發報的時間，總是在破曉時光，不然，我倒要來看看。那些每天送報的人，一定在你們報館門前，擁擠不堪了。』邵慧華道：「並不擁擠！倘然說是全上海的送報人，都要每天到報館裏來拿報，那自然要擁擠不堪了？但現在的發行部，設立了許多發行站。就像我們報館裏，在上海就有十二個發行站。報一出版，便用卡車運送到各處發行站。醫如西區的西區，東區的東區，南市的南市，北市的北市，全市的送報網，各有地域。送報人都到各個發行站去守候，你要看，倒是到那發行站去看，一排排的脚踏車，都排着號頭，在他們出發時，到也很有可觀咧。（二五一）</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops Divide into Three Routes to Encircle Lingshan, Suffering Heavy Losses from Chinese Ambush and Retreating in Disarray; Highway Between Nanning and the Coast Cut Off by Chinese Forces; Japanese Strongholds Near Hushan All Recaptured, Japanese Troops Extremely Panic-Stricken</h3>
<p>Binyang: The Japanese troops along the Yongqinqian area have recently resumed large-scale activities. The Chinese forces, according to the pre-set plan, have been fiercely besieging them for days, inflicting extraordinarily heavy casualties on the Japanese. Japanese troops who attacked east from Mozixu were severely attacked in Nanyang Township, Fuban, suffering countless casualties throughout the day. On the 16th, near Jiuzhou, they were ambushed again by the Chinese forces, and the remaining Japanese troops were retreating in disarray, with extreme panic. Japanese troops who arrived near Xinpingxu from the east side of Xiaodong were surrounded by the Chinese on three sides and are being heavily annihilated. Japanese troops harassing Luwuzi were encircled and annihilated by the Chinese forces, suffering more than half their casualties. Currently, the remaining Japanese troops are trapped near Jinjiling Xinpingxu, and the Chinese are launching a fierce attack. (Dispatch of the 17th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: According to Chinese sources, the Japanese military, in order to clear the Chinese forces that were harassing the Yongqin Highway, have divided their forces into three routes to encircle Lingshan, northeast of Qinzhou and southeast of Nanning. It is reported that a group of Chinese mobile units have been dispatched from Lingshan to cut off the highway between Nanning and the coast, preventing supplies from reaching Nanning, in order to threaten the rear of the Japanese army. Lingshan is located on the south bank of the Yu River, in the southwest of Guangdong Province, close to the Guangxi border. The provincial highway connects to Pinghai on the Yongqin Highway and Beihai along the coast. The Japanese army is currently advancing in three routes: central, southern, and northern. It is reported that fierce battles have broken out in various districts near Lingshan. (Reuters Dispatch of the 17th)</p>
<h3>Chinese Forces in Northern Henan Launch Attacks on Japanese Troops</h3>
<p>Zhengzhou: On the dawn of the 14th, the Chinese forces in northern Henan launched an attack on Huayuan, northwest of Bo'ai. The Japanese troops responded in panic, and after four hours of engagement, more than 100 Japanese soldiers were killed. (Dispatch of the 17th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops from Daming Fail in Eastern Advance</h3>
<p>Somewhere in Hebei: The Japanese troops from Daming have been advancing eastward towards Xifuji for days, but were intercepted by the Chinese forces, resulting in fierce battles. The Chinese forces also dispatched a strong force to encircle the Japanese flank and launch a fierce pincer attack. The Japanese troops could not withstand the attack and retreated south. The Chinese forces are continuing to pursue them. (Dispatch of the 17th)</p>
<p>Meixian: In the Chaoshan area, the Japanese troops gathered their remnants and engaged in westward activities. After being ambushed by the Chinese from both sides, Japanese corpses littered the fields. They broke through and fled for days, while the Chinese forces tracked and pursued them, sweeping away the remnants like a storm sweeping away fallen leaves. They first recaptured Chenghai, then occupied Butang, Shuimei, Gaochun, and Tangdi. Countless Japanese soldiers were killed. On the 12th, they cleared out the remaining Japanese troops near Paotaishi, and then recaptured Taoshan. In the afternoon, they continued to recapture Xiaosangpu Mountain, Dengmei, and other places. On the morning of the 13th, the data points of Gaisang Xiao Mountain, Dahuangkeng were recaptured and the remaining Japanese troops at Guishan, Longxiang Peak, Guxiang, Fengxi, and other places were all annihilated. Soon after, they recaptured data points such as Juyang. Currently, the remaining Japanese troops have retreated to the vicinity of Chaozhou Anbu and are extremely panicked. (Dispatch of the 17th)</p>
<p>Yingde: On the 10th and 11th, the Chinese forces encountered the Japanese troops in Maliji Ling (east of Zhongluotan), Fengweixia (southeast of Taipingchang), Macun, Wucun (east of Taipingchang), and other places. After a brave charge by the Chinese forces, the Japanese were all defeated, with one Japanese captain and more than 200 soldiers killed, and many materials seized. (Dispatch of the 17th)</p>
<p>Guilin: The Chinese forces on the west side of Gaofeng Ao have been extremely active recently. A certain unit advanced towards Bajiaoling on the night of the 11th, passing through the rear of the Japanese at Kuijieling. The Japanese troops repeatedly attempted to counterattack, but were unsuccessful. Another unit of the Chinese forces advanced from ××× and has approached Xinxu. The Japanese troops on the front of Gaofeng Ao have twice harassed the area, but were met with a counterattack by the Chinese forces and retreated in defeat, suffering casualties. (Dispatch of the 17th)</p>
<p>Guilin: The Japanese troops who invaded east from Pumiao arrived at Fengxi Village, west of Yongchun, on the morning of the 14th.

<h3>Chinese Forces in Shanxi Province Continue to Expand Their Gains; Fierce Battles Continue in the Jingle and Wutai Areas</h3>
<p>Xingji: The Chinese forces in various parts of Shanxi Province continue to expand their gains. Fierce battles have continued in the Jingle and Wutai areas in recent days. The Japanese troops reinforced Jingle with over 1,000 soldiers from Xin County, and in coordination with the Japanese troops in the Wutai area, launched repeated fierce attacks.

Until the night of the 8th, the Chinese forces launched a major offensive and fought fiercely throughout the day. By evening, the Japanese troops could not withstand the attack and retreated to Wutai. The Chinese forces seized the opportunity to pursue them. The Chinese forces believed that the opportunity to annihilate the Japanese troops had arrived, and the entire army charged into the Japanese阵地. The exhausted Japanese troops fought again without any fighting spirit, and the Chinese forces pursued and killed them relentlessly for several hours, killing more than 400 Japanese soldiers and seizing many spoils of war. The remaining Japanese troops are retreating to Wutai, and the Chinese forces are still pursuing them.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union and the Far East After the Soviet-Finnish Peace</h3>
<p>Following the establishment of peace between the Soviet Union and Finland, Soviet-Japanese relations have once again entered a tense and delicate state: Although the rumor of a renewed clash at Nomonhan has been denied by the Japanese military as lacking common sense, disputes in the Sakhalin Island area have followed one after another. According to Japanese sources, on the 11th of this month, a Soviet aircraft flew into Japanese territory on the island, and on the 15th, a local conflict occurred between border guards from both sides. Regardless of the truth of the matter and how it evolves, this will undoubtedly draw the world's attention from the Gulf of Finland and the Karelian Isthmus to the winds and clouds on the Soviet-Japanese and Soviet-Manchukuo borders.</p>
<p>If one looks only at the surface of events, some may believe that the above-mentioned events are a manifestation of the Soviet Union's increasingly active Far Eastern policy, and thus harbor premature optimism. However, it is important to note that even while dealing with Finland with all its might, the Soviet Union has always maintained a strict level of vigilance in the Far East and has never had a passive moment. At the beginning of the Soviet-German non-aggression pact last autumn, the general view was that the Soviet Union was about to become tougher on Japan, but the next act was the cessation of hostilities at Nomonhan and the entry of Soviet troops into Poland. Although the Soviet Union's western border has now been absolutely secured and is no longer in danger of being invaded, in the current complex international situation, the Soviet Union may not take the threat from Japan as seriously as it seems, to the point of taking immediate action. Looking at the current facts, it is more reasonable to say that conflicts like the one on Sakhalin Island are more of an attempt by the Japanese to launch a new offensive against the Soviet Union than the Soviet Union becoming more active towards Japan.</p>
<p>The war between the Soviet Union and Finland, although resulting in the Soviet Union securing its western border, also led to the revival of the anti-Soviet movement in Western European countries. The international calls for aid to Finland and the measures taken were mainly driven by this anti-Soviet movement. Now that peace has been declared between the Soviet Union and Finland, the various events caused by that war should also come to an end in principle, such as the anti-Soviet movement. Perhaps in the minds of some people in Western Europe, the anti-Soviet sentiment is more important than the war against Germany, but this is not a healthy idea. If the relations between the Western powers and the Soviet Union continue to deteriorate, the Soviet-German alliance will become stronger, further exacerbating the difficulties of the Allied powers, and giving the aggressor Japan in the Far East a chance to profit from speculation, using the guise of anti-Sovietism as a basis for bargaining with the Allied powers, which is harmful to the Allied powers in every way. It has been almost ten years since the "September 18th Incident," and the sparks have long since expanded into a prairie fire. The chronic disease of the inability of the various powers to coordinate has not improved much. This is unfortunate for the Far East, and even more unfortunate for the powers themselves. Fortunately, China is still energetic and promising, independently shouldering the heavy responsibility of containing aggression, and dragging down the Japanese clique until they are exhausted. However, in international relations, the powers still leave the Japanese clique with room for maneuvering, allowing them to constantly oscillate between anti-British and anti-Soviet postures to carry out threats and intimidation. If this situation continues, it will not be China that suffers, but the powers themselves. Like the rumors of a secret Anglo-Japanese or Soviet-Japanese non-aggression pact, we believe that they are just baseless fabrications, but they sometimes have a subtle influence in the international arena. Now that the Japanese are conducting probes through anti-Sovietism again, its response is naturally worthy of attention. On the other hand, even if the Soviet Union is ready to take active action against Japan, it will inevitably have concerns due to mutual suspicion in the international community. Today, the positions of the various powers in the Far East are mostly firm and unwavering, and there is no room for doubt, but the lack of coordination between them is a major weakness, which urgently needs the efforts of those who care about the fate of the Far East.</p>

<p>Tokyo: When the House of Representatives met yesterday to discuss the Eugenic Law, Congressman Muramatsu Hisayoshi of the Minseito Party inquired, saying that this Eugenic Law would affect population reproduction. In recent years, Japan's population birth rate has been declining, which is worrying. Therefore, the government should take the necessary steps to increase the birth rate while promoting eugenic policies, in order to remedy the situation. "The various strata of society feel that life is difficult and are in a state of unease. If competition for birth control is due to economic reasons, it is even more worrying. China and the Soviet Union have much higher population birth rates than our country, so it is the government's responsibility to adopt active policies to save the phenomenon of population decline."

<p>Japan Expands Markets in South America; Gradually Concludes Commercial Treaties with South American Countries</p>
<p>Tokyo: Business circles here are deeply afraid that American economic power will penetrate into South America and Central America after the outbreak of the European war, and will eventually close the market for Japanese goods. At one time, a movement to dominate the South American market was launched here, but the huge competition from the United States has made business leaders here extremely worried. Japanese diplomats in the Western Hemisphere have suggested convening a round table conference in Washington, which will be attended by Japanese ambassadors and ministers to North, Central, and South American countries. The purpose is to find ways to prevent American economic power from further penetrating into Central and South American countries. Since the abolition of the Japanese-American commercial treaty in 1911, Japanese-American trade has been based on a day-to-day situation. Japan is eager to eliminate its dependence on the United States, so it wants to find markets to sell its products and wants to buy its necessities from other markets. The Argentine government has sent an economic mission to Tokyo. Although no decision has been announced by either party, it is generally believed that a larger-scale basis for mutual trade between the two countries has been built. Mexico and Paraguay also plan to send similar missions to Japan. The Japanese-Uruguayan commercial treaty, which had been piling up in the files for several years, was taken out of the dust a few weeks ago and has now been submitted to the Privy Council for final approval. Japan is working hard in Peru, Chile, Bolivia, and other Latin American countries to find ways to increase Japan's mutual trade with these countries. The two sides are negotiating barter arrangements. Japan plans to exchange raw silk and cotton fabrics for raw cotton, canned food, and, where possible, kerosene. The breakdown of the US-Argentina reciprocal trade negotiations has greatly pleased Japan. Some people believe that Japanese trade has gained good results in entering Latin America.

<h3>US President Appeals to the World to Seek a Moral Peace: If Human Life is Dominated by Force, Peace Will Be Difficult to Sound and Lasting</h3>

<p>Washington: President Roosevelt declared in a broadcast to the world yesterday that the world is seeking a true peace that is sufficient to guarantee the sovereignty of small countries and the freedom of religious culture. "We should seek today a peace based on morality. If the whole world cannot become brothers, there will be no true peace. If the fruits of peace are oppression, hunger, cruelty, or weapons are superior to humanity, then peace will not last long. If small countries live under the threat of powerful countries, then peace will not be solid. If freedom is deprived by aggression, then there will be no moral peace. If the will and thoughts of mankind are suppressed, there will be no reasonable peace. If God is denied, there will be no upright peace. From the end of the last European war to today's European war, the world has not had a peace based on this." (17th United Press Telegraph)</p>

<h3>The Future of War and Peace in Europe: Only Roosevelt Sees Clearly: Anglo-French Policy Suffers Twofold Failure: Turkey Needs Ten Years of Peace</h3>
<p>Rome: As of last night, how many chances are there for the Anglo-French-German war to end? Aside from Mussolini, who knows a little, there are only two people who understand the overall situation: US President Roosevelt and Under Secretary of State Welles. Only they know that this trip is in vain. Mr. Welles, in his capacity as a mediator, has been traveling between Rome, Berlin, Paris, and London, using his eloquent tongue to attempt to discover possible conditions that Roosevelt can use as a basis to mediate the European war and make the hope of peace a reality. It has been three weeks. Now, before returning to his country, Mr. Welles has come here again and held a second meeting with Mr. Mussolini last night. Therefore, it seems that peace or war is still uncertain. Recalling when Mr. Welles first decided to negotiate with Mr. Mussolini and his son-in-law Ciano, the British and French were searching for new battlefields and seeking strategists. The Siegfried Line is as solid as gold, firmly rejecting the Entente powers outside the German western border, and the Entente powers have also realized that they cannot enter Germany without risking wrongdoing by violating the neutrality of several countries. Now, when Mr. Welles is having final talks with Mr. Mussolini and others for the sake of peace, it is heard that London and Paris are still insisting on their opinions and saying that they are looking for a way to test the power of real war. However, the two sides have been at war for six and a half months, and the Entente powers have not been able to find a place from which to inflict an effective blow on Germany. As for Germany, apart from passing through the Maginot Line, there is no other way to directly attack the Allied powers. Since Mr. Welles arrived here on the 25th of last month, the European situation has undergone great changes. All Europeans say that Finland's failure to formally ask Britain and France for assistance is a failure of British and French diplomacy, and they say that Finland does not seem to trust the Allied powers, so it negotiated peace with the Soviet Union without consulting with Britain and France. The military policies and diplomatic policies of the British and French governments are currently being criticized from all sides, and intense debates are also taking place in domestic public opinion. Some people in both countries are demanding war with the Soviet Union, believing that this is the only way to attack Germany. However, Turkey's policy is contrary to what is widely rumored. Turkey does not want to become a battlefield, just like the Scandinavian countries. So how will the Allied powers attack the Soviet Union? People close to the Turkish government told reporters, "Turkey will never sign a treaty that directly opposes the Soviet Union. Therefore, in the alliance between Turkey and Britain and France, there is not a single word that would oblige Turkey to fight against the Soviet Union if the Allied powers were to fight against the Soviet Union. Turkey needs at least ten years of peace. The losses suffered by Turkey from the earthquake are very serious, and the number of people killed and injured exceeds the total number of killed and injured in the German attack on Poland, which is many times more than the losses suffered by the Allied powers in the so-called war for six months." Therefore, the Germans sit comfortably behind the Siegfried Line and call out to the Allied powers, "Come," but the Allied powers cannot find a battlefield, so the war is in a dilemma, which is probably the only biggest factor that favors Mr. Welles' mission. However, at the same time, it is heard that Italy is declaring that millions of Italian youths have received military training and are well-equipped, including three army corps ready to be formed. Also, according to diplomatic sources here, Germany, Italy, the Soviet Union, Hungary, and Romania plan to form a group, but this saying has not yet been confirmed.

<h3>Italy and the European War (Written by Guido, Editor-in-Chief of the Italian Daily)</h3>
<p>Six months have passed since the outbreak of the European war. People often ask each other, "What is Italy's opinion?" Among the major European countries, only Italy has not been involved in the war. In addition, Prime Minister Mussolini's publicly stated Italian policy only regards itself as a non-belligerent country and has not declared neutrality. It can be seen that Italy is not completely outside the current war. For this reason, Italy's views and attitudes are extremely important for the future of the European war. Its influence is very important and decisive. This is very obvious. On the Italian side, it is deeply felt that the current war will definitely be protracted, and the number of victories and defeats cannot be foreseen, and the consumption must be huge. Although it is generally recognized that this war is a useless move, the participating countries will not stop fighting until they are exhausted. However, since the beginning of the war, all extremely predictions have been denied by the facts. For example, large-scale air raids have not yet been realized. The reason is that both sides do not want to start first, so as to avoid retaliation from the other side. Therefore, the terrible air war is avoided because of its terribleness. At the same time, both sides on land are also hesitant to carry out mobile warfare and dare not imitate Napoleonic or Prussian tactics to launch attacks decisively. This situation, rather than saying that it is because the French Maginot Line and the German Siegfried Line are both impregnable, and both sides have their own reliance, so they are self-restrained and do not attack. The reason is that both sides have different measures of the way of war, which is more accurate. As far as Germany is concerned, after conquering Poland, it declared that there was no need to fight on the Western Front and did not want to be the head of the army. Although Britain and France are rich in assets, their domestic population is not as large as that of Germany, so it is necessary to save manpower. Therefore, their war foundation focuses on the economic, political, and social aspects, while the military aspect is secondary. In short, these countries expect to use severe</p>
<p>Static means to surround Germany</p>
<p>Consuming its resources, cutting off its supplies, so that it can gradually weaken its resistance without having to fight a large-scale war, so as to achieve victory. The different measures of both sides have led to this situation. Therefore, the number of victories and defeats is even more unpredictable, and the degree of consumption from beginning to end can be known. The reason why Britain and France adopted this strategy is based on estimating how long Germany's resistance can last. It is known that various statistics are often not enough to measure the strength of resistance. In the past, Italy's conquest of Abyssinia and the implementation of sanctions by various countries failed, which is its lesson. As far as Germany is concerned during this war, it must have been fully prepared both materially and spiritually. In the past few years, Germany has accumulated a large number of raw materials such as steel, iron, copper, rubber, and cotton, all of which are abundant. In terms of economy, it can be self-sufficient and has huge cash reserves. This cash is divided into four categories. First, in the era when the mark fell miserably, it had already accumulated huge amounts of gold and foreign exchange. At that time, countries around the world competed for speculation, and Germany was able to exchange its valueless paper money for gold and foreign exchange. Second, it obtained a lot of gold commercial loans in the United States. Third, its foreign trade surplus has been very large in recent years. Fourth, since annexing Austria and the Czech Republic, it has incorporated the reserves of the banks of these countries into the Deutsche Bank. In addition to the four, the static and virtual strategies adopted by Britain and France for the past six months have also enabled Germany to save military supplies and step up manufacturing to cultivate strength. However, this is delayed day after day until finally the country's resistance will definitely disappear completely, which can be asserted. However, Britain and France also</p>
<p>Inevitable to suffer serious damage</p>
<p>The impact is not limited to economic and financial matters, and may even extend to imperial interests. The wider the distribution of these interests, the more fragile they are.</p>
<p>Based on this, how the victory or defeat of this war will be, from the perspective of us Italians, although it cannot be foreseen, it is undoubtedly unfavorable to Europe. Prime Minister Mussolini, in view of this, has made every effort to prevent it from arising and to curb it after it has occurred. However, Britain and France are boasting about their economic and financial superiority, the world's sea power, and the universality of political power, believing that this is the way to victory and that they can control it. From the boasting of Britain and France, we associate with the so-called "reconstruction of Europe" issue. This issue is often talked about by the belligerent countries. Considering the current situation in the world, a few countries have strong strength, so before the war, they were confident that they had a good chance of winning. In addition to their monopoly and control, how can Europe maintain balance, and how can peace be guaranteed? The cause and effect in this are obvious and cannot be avoided. The reason is that Europe's resources have never been fairly distributed in accordance with the quality of each country's ethnic group and human rights and civil rights. This situation has become even worse since the establishment of the Treaty of Versailles. As a result, the European political situation has been turbulent for twenty years, and finally led to this great war. Tracing back to the source and looking forward, the new Europe should be the result of glorious peace, and it must</p>
<p>Establish balance as a major prerequisite</p>
<p>Otherwise, even if you want to transform it, you cannot get it. In addition, Britain and France still have one point that they often boast about, believing that Britain controls the throat of access to the Mediterranean Sea and can arbitrarily block it. This view can be seen in the newspapers of these countries. What is the purpose of such publicity? Do you want to warn Italy that it should be like a prisoner if it belongs to the Mediterranean? This kind of attitude of Britain and France is also very different from the meaning of freedom and equality that the new European countries must have. In Italy, the concept of the so-called new Europe is very simple, that is, Italy does not want to obtain any privileges in Europe or in the world. For any system, all those who directly or indirectly enable one or several countries to obtain hegemony are opposed. However, it must be said separately that Italy still has several issues that are vital to its survival that have not yet been resolved. The countries of the Versailles system not only failed to solve these problems but aggravated them. In short, these problems must be resolved in accordance with Italy's needs, and it is already urgent. On this point, the major European countries must thoroughly understand. Original</p>
<p>Italy needs nothing more than two things</p>
<p>First, it needs free and rich space for the development of the Italian people, so that they can work peacefully within Italian territory. Second, the Italian nation needs freedom of life and action and should have the right to eliminate all foreign-controlled systems. It is firmly believed that these needs can be resolved outside the "Versailles stance" and in a more fair and sound Europe. So how should this new Europe be composed? War or peace? Which way to go is difficult to predict. Since all countries do not want to be outside this organization, they do not take the position of neutral countries. Although they have no direct relationship with the war at present, they are prepared to maintain a position of influence in future wars and peace. Therefore, they are paying close attention to the evolution of this decisive European war and various situations. What is hoped is that the new Europe can be completed without expanding the war. Therefore, Italy's policy has always been to prevent the expansion of the scope of the war. Although the extent to which the European war can be expanded depends on the political and military plans of the belligerent countries, the Balkan Peninsula and the Mediterranean Sea are currently under threat, but the policy that Italy has grasped has already achieved something. Since the Soviet Union's power has invaded the Danube River basin and threatened the Balkan Peninsula, new problems have arisen in Europe. It must be known whether Italy has</p>
<p>Never ignore the communist threat</p>
<p>This is because Italy's position has the potential to support the Danube River countries, and it has become a very large country in the Balkan Peninsula. Its interests in this area have a permanent and survival-related nature. However, Italy has no aggressive plans against the Soviet Union, which is very different from other powers. The reason is that Italy's main purpose is only to prevent the spread of communism and eliminate the threat to the sound system of European civilization. To sum up, Italy's policy towards communism is essentially an inseparable part of establishing a sound and civilized European policy. The Soviet Union can rest easy within its borders, and Italy has no intention of hostility. On the contrary, if communism attempts to invade Europe and the area of Italy's survival interests, then Fascism knows how to deal with it (Translated by Havas Agency)</p>

<h3>Finland Sends Representatives to the Soviet Union to Handle Exchange of Documents, Resolve Outstanding Issues Between the Two Countries, and Basikivi Describes the Course of Peace Negotiations</h3>
<p>Helsinki: After the House of Representatives passed the Soviet-Finnish peace treaty, President Kallio has recently approved it. Cabinet Minister Basikivi is scheduled to lead a delegation to Moscow on the 18th of this month to exchange ratification documents with the Soviet authorities. At the same time, negotiations will continue on various unresolved issues, especially the re-demarcation of the border between the two countries, economic talks, and the restoration of diplomatic relations. According to a message from the official radio station, in accordance with Article 7 of the treaty, the ratification documents of both parties should be exchanged in Moscow within ten days of the treaty's establishment. Therefore, President Kallio authorized Basikivi to go to Moscow to handle this procedure, but the date of the exchange of ratification documents has not yet been determined and will be decided by the Soviet government at that time. (16th Havas Telegraph)</p>
<p>Helsinki: Cabinet Minister Basikivi recently made a statement to foreign reporters, saying that the border line drawn by this peace treaty is in fact not much different from the border line when Russia's Peter the Great bought Finnish territory from Sweden in 1721. When we were negotiating with the Soviet authorities in Moscow a few days ago, the Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov mentioned the name of Peter the Great twice. In total, we met eight times in Molotov's office, and Stalin himself never came out to participate. This is completely different from the situation last autumn. Also, when we were in Moscow, we only met with the envoys of so and so countries. Who they were is not convenient to tell. In short, when we were negotiating in Moscow, all our actions were extremely cautious, so that the Soviet authorities would not suspect that we were carrying out any conspiracy. As a result of the negotiations between the two sides, there were some amendments to the draft peace treaty, but they were all of a secondary nature, such as the amendment of the withdrawal date of the Red Army troops, etc., which were all irrelevant. As for the provision in the peace treaty that the Soviet authorities may build a railway line between the cities of Kemiärvi and Kondalahti, it was not included in the original plan proposed by that country. It is absolutely not true that the peace treaty is attached with secret clauses. In addition, there is one more thing to note, that is, when Molotov and I were negotiating, he only mentioned the name of Kuusinen (i.e., the Chairman of the "Finnish People's Government") once when discussing other issues. Although Article 3 of the peace treaty stipulates that the signatory countries must avoid attacking each other and must not conclude alliance treaties with countries that oppose either party, our country's proposal to conclude a defense alliance treaty with Norway and Sweden does not conflict with this clause, because if this treaty is established, it is not aimed at the Soviet Union, but at all countries that intend to attack us.

<h3>Residents Migrate from Finnish Ceded Areas, War-Torn Aftermath, Domestic Order Gradually Restored</h3>
<p>Helsinki: Tens of thousands of Finns with sad faces are now continuing to leave the ceded areas, either by train, streetcar, sled, or on foot, all eager to complete their migration in a short period of time. People across the country have temporarily suspended travel except for absolutely necessary matters in order to free up vehicles for migration. A Reuters special correspondent traveled on a train between Helsinki and Turku. There was no space on the train. The stations seen along the way were all bombed by Soviet planes and were not intact. Fire insurance experts estimate that the damage caused by air raids in Finnish cities is no less than ten million British pounds. Life in various parts of the country is now gradually returning to normal, and schools are scheduled to reopen in April. (17th Reuters Telegraph)</p>
<h3>Finnish, Swedish, and Norwegian Defense Alliance: Now Possible to Realize, Denmark's Attitude Is Cold, Sweden Intensifies Training of Reserve Soldiers</h3>
<p>Copenhagen: Reliable sources here said that a secret meeting will be held in the Swedish capital within days to discuss the conclusion of a joint defense alliance between the Nordic countries. Norwegian Speaker of Parliament Hambro and former Finnish Prime Minister Kallio arrived in Stockholm today. The Danish newspaper "Politiken" revealed this morning the attitude of the Danish people towards the conclusion of the alliance, saying that Denmark is now preparing to withdraw from the Nordic group, and if the Swedish, Norwegian, and Finnish talks conclude that it is necessary to conclude an alliance, Denmark does not intend to join. (17th Haitong Telegraph)</p>
<p>Helsinki: Authoritative sources here said yesterday that the possibility of Sweden concluding an alliance with Finland and Norway has greatly increased in the past few days. Swedish newspapers and public opinion unanimously support the conclusion of the alliance. At the same time, outside personnel solemnly denied the possibility of Germany participating in the alliance. Currently, there are two German military representatives in Stockholm, but they have not yet contacted the Swedish military authorities. It is heard that the content of the Finnish-Norwegian-Swedish alliance is as follows: (1) The signatory countries agree that mutual assistance clauses will take effect when any country is invaded; (2) No signatory country may conclude an alliance with other countries, otherwise this treaty will be invalid; (3) If a war occurs due to the implementation of the alliance, a signatory country must seek the consent of the other two countries before obtaining foreign aid; (4) This convention is purely defensive and does not contain any aggressive intent or preparation for recovering lost territory; (5) After a certain period of time (approximately five years), this treaty must be re-signed or canceled; (6) When necessary, the military staff groups of the signatory countries may hold talks to supplement the shortcomings of the various defense clauses. (17th United Press Telegraph)</p>
<p>Stockholm: In order to create a strong and independent Nordic region, the Swedish government has decided to summon reserve soldiers of the 1932 to 1936 classes for training. At the same time, the training period for reserve soldiers of the 1938 to 1940 classes will be increased from 175 days to 240 days. (17th Haitong News Agency)</p>

<h3>Panama President Protests to Britain Again, Claims British Ship's Interception of German Ship Violates Pan-American Neutrality Principles</h3>
<p>Washington – Regarding the incident of the German freighter "Wiega-mar" sinking itself on February 12 in Brazilian waters when confronted by a British warship, the Republic of Panama has lodged a protest with the British government on behalf of the twenty-one American republics. The U.S. State Department has issued a public statement stating that the President of the Republic of Panama, Boyd, sent a note to the British Chargé d'Affaires in Panama on February 14, stating, "According to a report from the Brazilian government, the German freighter 'Wiega-mar' was intercepted by a warship of Your Majesty's government on February 12, clearly with the intention of inspecting and detaining it, and was scuttled by its own crew fifteen miles off the coast of Brazil. According to Article 13 of the Hague Convention, the actions of Your Majesty's warship constitute an act of hostility. Moreover, this incident occurred within the territorial waters of the American continent. The twenty-one American republics unanimously consider this fact to be a violation of the principles previously established by all Pan-American nations in the capital of Panama. Therefore, the President is authorized to lodge a protest and request that Your Majesty's government not allow the war to expand into the territorial waters of the American continent, as this territorial sea is the route for peaceful commerce for all American nations."

<h3>Moscow Communist Party Holds Congress</h3>
<p>Moscow – The joint congress of the Moscow City and Moscow District Communist Party opened on March 15. Secretary Shcherbakov reported on the development of Moscow City and Moscow District. Shcherbakov said, "In 1939, the total output of Moscow City and Moscow District was 17,497,000,000 rubles, accounting for 23.7% of the total output of the Soviet Union. From 1938 to 1939, the output of the Moscow District increased by 38.5% compared with 1937. The national defense industry has also made great achievements. In the past two years, the total trade volume of Moscow City has increased by 30%, and the total volume of Moscow District has increased by 34%. In 1932, according to the budget of the Moscow Soviet, a total of 1,500,000,000 rubles was used for education, health, and other municipal improvements." The congress also sent a telegram to Stalin, saying, "The signing of the Soviet-Finnish peace treaty has dealt a fatal blow to international war provocateurs. They have lost one of the most important bases for attacking the Soviet Union. Stalin's peaceful diplomacy has achieved victory." (TASS dispatch, 16th)</p>
<h3>Norway Lodges Strong Protest with Germany over German Submarine Sinking Norwegian Ship, Reserves Right to Claim Compensation for Losses</h3>
<p>Oslo – After the Norwegian ship "Nidaro-holm" was sunk by a German submarine with torpedoes on February 12, the government authorities lodged a strong protest with the German government. A communiqué was issued stating, "On February 12, our country's ship 'Nidaro-holm' was sailing in the Irish Sea when it encountered a German submarine. The submarine immediately fired three shots before launching torpedoes to sink it. At that time, our country's crew members had already escaped on lifeboats. The submarine then fired three more shots, fortunately missing. The crew members floated on the sea for nine hours before being rescued by a Norwegian ship. Our country's minister to Germany, Hill, visited German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop on the 15th of this month, informing him that the German submarine sank our country's ship without inspection and did not take any steps to ensure the safety of the crew according to the provisions of the London Protocol of November 6, 1936 (of which Germany is also a signatory). This is a violation of international law. Therefore, we lodge a strong protest and reserve the right to claim compensation for losses, hoping that the German government can take appropriate steps to punish the submarine commander."

<h3>British and French Cabinets to be Reorganized, Strengthening Wartime Agencies</h3>
<p>London – Diplomatic sources here have stated that after the establishment of the Soviet-Finnish peace, a political issue has emerged in Britain and France, namely whether the powers of the respective national cabinets can be strengthened to facilitate military operations, such as reducing the number of cabinet members and forming a true wartime cabinet, without each cabinet member being solely in charge of a department. The intention is to strengthen the activities of the governments of both countries in all aspects. In Britain, it is said that Prime Minister Chamberlain will consider this issue during the Easter holiday, but it is generally expected that there will be no major changes other than the three departments of the Army, Air Force, and Military Supplies.

<h3>Zhu Jiahua Discusses the European War, with No Disadvantage to China (Continued), China's Diplomacy Is Skillful and Bears an Important Mission of World Peace, 6. The European War and China</h3>
<p>In summary, Britain and France are in a superior economic position, but relying solely on economic power to force Germany to surrender, even if achievable, can only happen in the distant future. The international situation is constantly changing, and every event can affect the war situation. At present, both warring parties are striving to seek allies to increase their own strength and inspire their national morale. However, neutral countries are overwhelmed with bewilderment and fear, and because of bewilderment and fear, they observe and hesitate, and try to please both sides. This state is also one of the reasons for the slow spread of the European war.</p>
<p>Before the war began, the diplomatic war had already exhausted its capabilities. The theory of old military strategists that "all political claims in wartime are issued from the barrel of a gun" has been completely destroyed by modern shrewd politicians. To predict the future of the European war, we must first recognize that when this war broke out, it had already revealed the outlines of a world war. Except for the possibility of a successful compromise midway, it is a very natural and mediocre thing for the European war to evolve into a worldwide war. A spark can start a prairie fire, especially with China's war of resistance against Japan in the Far East, which is about to enter its fourth year, and the fierce Soviet-Finnish war in Northern Europe.</p>
<p>Secondly, what we should recognize is the correlation and even inseparability of the Sino-Japanese War and the European War. At present, the violent Japan is being held back by China and cannot do anything or take advantage of the situation. It can be said that China has fulfilled an infinitely great responsibility to the world.</p>
<p>How the European war will develop, we are not in a position to make a hasty judgment, but we believe that the impact of a compromise midway or the prolongation of the European war will not be unfavorable to us. This is because our national policy of resistance has long been determined, and the foundation of two years and eight months of resistance is unshakeable. Our diplomacy is in our own hands and can be used skillfully.</p>
<p>However, we must firmly grasp the opportunity of this European war, passively crushing Japan's aggression politics, and actively completing our task of national revival. In particular, we must make the whole world recognize how important the mission that China bears for the entire world peace is, and how great its contribution to the world is. Then, how just and legitimate is the reward that China should receive - freedom, independence, sovereignty, and administrative integrity? (End)</p>

<h3>Foreign Ratepayers' Annual Meeting Proposals, Taxpayers Closely Watch, If Proposal to Increase Taxes is Raised, It Will Become the Focus of Fierce Debate</h3>
<p>The Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Public Concession, previously due to a resolution of the Board of Directors of the Municipal Council to levy an additional 50% on municipal rates and land rates starting from July 1, which was to be submitted to the Western Ratepayers' Annual Meeting for discussion, was addressed by the Citizens' Federation, stating the citizens' inability to bear the burden, and requesting the withdrawal of the original proposal. After the Chinese Ratepayers' Association forwarded a letter of protest to the Municipal Council, a letter of reply was received from the Municipal Council stating that this protest would be submitted to the Board of Directors for consideration without fail.</p>
<p>Annual Meeting Procedures</p>
<p>The annual meeting of foreign ratepayers in the Public Concession for this year has been scheduled for April 17. The election of directors and property committee members will be held on April 10 and 11. The Municipal Council has now decided to reappoint Mr. Blunt as the one Municipal Council representative to the Property Committee. Mr. Blunt has represented the Municipal Council on the Property Committee for ten years. The agenda of this year's foreign ratepayers' annual meeting will remain as usual, with the chairman delivering a speech and reporting on the situation over the past year, followed by a discussion of the municipal annual budget and final accounts. It is also said that the procedural rules for the foreign ratepayers' annual meeting will be revised this year to make the meeting procedures more orderly and clear.</p>
<p>Focus of Debate</p>
<p>As for the proposal to increase the municipal rates, special property rates, and land rate surcharges by 50% from July 1 of this year, it is still unknown whether this proposal will be suspended due to opposition from various parties. As the foreign annual meeting is imminent, all parties are paying close attention to it. However, it is generally expected that if this proposal is indeed raised at the annual meeting, it will become the center of fierce debate, as Chinese and foreign taxpayers alike are unwilling and indeed unable to bear any further burdens at this difficult time.</p>
<p>Opinions of the Hospitality Industry</p>
<p>Hotel industry colleagues, due to the Municipal Council's decision to increase the overall rate, are facing an excessive burden. A few days ago, they sent a letter to the Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Public Concession and the Chinese Director of the Municipal Council, Yu Qiaqing, appealing for the reversal of this decision. It is now learned that when the industry receives a reply, it will convene a meeting to discuss how to respond. According to a Mr. from the Hotel Association yesterday, the Municipal Council's increase in taxes on 150-160 Chinese-style medium-sized hotels will make it difficult for the industry to bear. Since the war, the prices of various goods have risen several times, while the increase in room rates by the industry has only been 40%. Therefore, it is already difficult for the industry to maintain current operations, let alone bear heavier taxes. According to the current Municipal Council's taxation of the industry, it will increase from 40 yuan per quarter to more than 130 yuan.</p>
<h3>Valuation Committee Discusses Standard Market Price of Lump Coal, Coal Merchants Unwilling to Hoard and Suppress Prices for Shipment, Plan to Continue Selling Coal Balls at Low Prices</h3>
<p>Since the establishment of the Valuation Committee by the authorities of the two concessions, after repeated discussions, it has been generally agreed that the soaring prices of goods are caused by hoarding and manipulation, especially for rice and coal. The committee has paid close attention to the coal price, and has sent personnel to the coal industry and coal ball associations to inquire about the root causes of the rise in various types of coal lumps, as well as the manufacturing costs of coal balls and the source of coal dust, and has urged the coal industry association to register coal lumps to facilitate statistics. It is now learned that the Valuation Committee is discussing specific standards for the sale price of coal lumps, which will be implemented. On the one hand, it intends to urge the coal industry to transport as much as possible to increase inventory. Now major firms have successively reduced prices for shipment and are unwilling to hoard to avoid losses and punishment.</p>
<p>Continuing Low-Price Sales</p>
<p>The low-price sale of coal balls has been in effect for more than two weeks since it began, and the situation in various places is very good. It has now reached its end, but the industry intends to continue to do so for the benefit of the common people. The industry association has scheduled a joint meeting of all factories at 3:00 pm on the 20th of this month at the hall on Tianjin Road to discuss the proper method in order to discuss it at length. It is heard that at that time, the supply of flat balls and flat selling location procedures of each factory will be presented for discussion and improvement, and the coal ball firms that sell at flat prices will also be strongly encouraged to continue to take on the task.</p>
<p>Opinions of Coal Merchants</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, together with various relevant coal industry groups, agreed on a price limit for coal balls in the city, it is now 210 yuan per ton and 5.8 yuan per dan. Because the cost of each coal ball factory is huge, it has sent a letter to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce for relief. A reporter from the New Life News Agency specially visited a coal merchant yesterday to ask for opinions on relieving the coal ball factory. According to a certain person, (1) if coal balls are not sold at flat prices, please consider increasing the market price; (2) the number of coal balls sold at flat prices and the location of the flat sales should be increased to make them more widespread; (3) the flat selling date should be based on the market price of coal balls. If the coal balls fall to within 100 yuan or within 50 yuan, they should be stopped immediately; (4) to increase the number of flat ball purchases, it is best to limit each person to one yuan each time, and record it for reference.</p>
<p>Firewood and Charcoal are Transported to Shanghai</p>
<p>After the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce came forward to find a solution to the fuel problem in the Shanghai market as a whole, the market price of coal lumps and firewood charcoal has begun to fall. The spot goods in the market have doubled. According to news from the firewood charcoal industry yesterday, as the number of Shanghai-Ningbo flights has increased, the Wenzhou-Taizhou firewood charcoal piled up in Ningbo ports has been continuously loaded onto ships and transported to Shanghai for regulation. Because loose packing and basket packing are different, the number of shipments to the port cannot be counted.

<h3>The Third Phase of Low-Priced Rice Sales Will be Held Tomorrow, The Undertaking Rice Shops Have Changed Slightly, The Location is in a Busy Area, I am Deeply Afraid that Incidents Will Occur at that Time, The Work of Selling Tickets and Distributing Rice Must Not be Exchanged Privately</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Low-Priced Rice Sales Committee entrusted the Rice Shop Industry Association to handle the third phase of the low-priced rice sales of tribute rice, which was decided to be implemented from 1:00 pm tomorrow. In addition to the promulgation of the announcement by the police bureaus of the two concessions, ordering the rice purchasing crowds to observe order and not cause incidents, the Shanghai Rice Shop Industry Association also received an order from the French Concession Police Department yesterday. Among the 80 low-priced rice shops announced previously, one or two locations were on traffic arteries. In case of crowded crowds, incidents are unavoidable. It is necessary to change the location separately. The low-priced rice shops that have been re-assigned by the Rice Shop Industry Association are now announced as follows.</p>
<p>Reassigned</p>
<p>(1) Wanfeng Rice Shop, No. 6 Xiafei Road, will be changed to Yuanfeng Rice Shop, No. 332 Mintiniyin Road to sell tickets, (2) Zhenhengchang Rice Shop Ticket Office, No. 52 Bair Road, will be changed to Yixing Rice Shop Branch Ticket Office, No. 32 Xin Yong'an Street (3) Hengkang Rice Shop, No. 89 Bair Road, will be changed to Changtaixing Rice Shop, No. 37 Lao Yong'an Street to distribute rice, and the Rice Shop Industry Association, taking into account the circumstances in which the ticket sellers and rice distributors of the first and second phases of the low-priced rice shops exchanged work, which is contrary to the proposal, so it is notified to all industries that the designated low-priced rice shops must abide by the resolution during the third phase of the low-priced dates, and must not privately change the designated work.</p>
<p>Rice Prices Plummet</p>
<p>A reporter from the New Life News Agency learned from the rice industry yesterday that the source of Guomi, japonica, and indica rice has become stronger recently. About 10,000 bags arrive by land and water every day. It is heard that Suzhou, Changshu, and Wuxi are the main ones, followed by Jiaxing and Jiashan, and Wuhu indica goods also arrive every other day. Therefore, the inventory of rice warehouses in Shanghai is increasing day by day, and people's hearts have become stable. The market transaction is also moving towards the right track, and the prices of Guomi and foreign rice are plummeting daily. Yesterday, foreign rice plummeted by 1 yuan and 45 cents, and the rest were down by a small amount of 1 yuan or 7 or 8 cents. Therefore, there is no shortage of people's food in Shanghai as a whole, and it is expected that rice prices will tend to fall. Also, the Rice Industry Tea Market issued Public Announcement No. 127 yesterday, saying, "According to a joint letter from more than 70 colleagues, it is very inconvenient for warehouses and silver firms to take a holiday every Sunday. Collect public opinions and plan to take a holiday one day a week as a general rule. The 66th Management Committee meeting has approved this, allowing a holiday one day a week every Sunday from April of the Republic of China. If it is necessary for business operations, the holiday can be canceled at any time, etc., recorded in the records, and corresponding public announcements are made for all to know. This announcement.</p>

<h3>Donations for Jingsheng Ferry Disaster Relief Enthusiastically Provided</h3>

After the news was published in various newspapers, Ningbo natives in Shanghai generously donated large sums of money. It is reported that Ningbo broadcasting personalities, such as Zhang Renxin, an expert in lecturing on scriptures, and He Guizhang, a writer of Siming documents, are actively promoting fundraising for this tragic incident.

<h3>Post Offices in Both Concessions Refuse to Accept Japanese Military Scrip; One-Sided Implementation by Post Office; Not Even in Use in Occupied Areas</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Postal Administration yielded to Japanese demands, allowing the public to purchase stamps or open drafts with Japanese military scrip, very few people have been using the scrip at post offices. This is especially true in the Concession areas. The Universal News Agency reporter has compiled the following details:</p>
<p>Purchasing Stamps</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Postal Administration agreed to allow the public to purchase various stamps with Japanese currency and military scrip, the general public has shown a strong sense of righteousness and has refrained from using the scrip. Only a small number of people in post offices in occupied areas have used the Japanese military scrip, while the vast majority still use legal tender, as legal tender remains the only currency in circulation in occupied areas. Furthermore, the regulations for purchasing stamps with Japanese currency and military scrip are limited to Hongkou and post offices in occupied areas. Post offices in the Concessions do not accept them.</p>
<p>Opening Drafts</p>
<p>Recently, the Administration unilaterally agreed to allow the opening of drafts to Hankou and Jiujiang with Japanese military scrip, but this is also limited to post offices in occupied areas. Branches in the Concessions do not comply. Only post offices in the Shanghai suburbs of Hongkou, Heng Road, Nan Shi, Zhoujin Road, Laoximen, and Pudong Lanni Ferry handle this. However, very few people have been opening drafts with Japanese military scrip recently.</p>
<h3>Excess Profits Tax on Lunar Calendar Settlements; Calculation Method: Add One-Tenth of Full Year's Tax</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday notified its affiliated trade associations: "We are writing to inform you that on the 16th of this month, we received a letter from the Income Tax Affairs Office of the Ministry of Finance, stating that according to Instruction No. 11605 of the Ministry of Finance, the revised Excess Profits Tax Ordinance for Extraordinary Periods, Section 2, Paragraph 2 stipulates that the excess profits tax shall be levied from January 1, 1939. This should be complied with. However, businesses in various locations that calculate based on the business year generally use the period from the beginning to the end of the lunar calendar year as a business year, and settle at the end of the lunar calendar year. From the aforementioned levy date of January 1, 1939, to the end of the 17th year of the lunar calendar (i.e., February 18, 1939, of the Gregorian calendar), there are a total of 49 days. The profits during this period should also be taxed according to law. The calculation method shall be the same as the established method for the Category I income tax, which is to add one-tenth of the full-year excess profits tax for 1939 to simplify the calculation. This is more lenient than the established method for Category I income tax, which only taxes income for 40 days and adds one-tenth. This is being issued for compliance."</p>
<h3>Illegal Premium System Nearing Complete Elimination; 2.5 Million Yuan of Fractional Currency Issued</h3>
<p>Following the Ministry of Finance's order to the Central, China, Communications, and Farmers Banks to regulate the shortage of fractional currency notes in the Shanghai market, there are now sufficient fractional and one-yuan currency notes in circulation. The fractional currency substitute notes previously issued by various businesses, except for the tram and bus companies, have gradually been recalled. Businesses are now using fractional currency notes for change. In the past, the premium for exchanging legal tender for fractional notes reached as high as 15 yuan per 100 yuan, and the premium for one-yuan notes was 25 yuan per 1,000 yuan. Now, this illegal premium system is nearing complete elimination. Although small money changers are listing a premium of 5 yuan per 1,000 yuan for one-yuan notes and 3 yuan per 100 yuan for fractional notes, there is little demand. Regarding the fractional currency notes approved for issuance by the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank, 2.5 million yuan has already been issued. Further issuances will continue based on market demand. These fractional currency notes are printed by the American Yongning Company and issued solely by the Shanghai branch of the bank. However, many have been circulated inland and are still generally accepted.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Lighterage Company Rice-Carrying Sailboat Sinks</h3>
<p>The Ningbo Shipping Lighterage Company's No. 68 large sailboat (commonly known as a "Lutan boat"), license number 968, was transporting 150 bags of rice for the Ningbo Food Company from the "Moufuku" wheel outside the port on the evening of the 13th. It arrived in Ningbo and was moored in the river in front of the Hongxing Wharf, scheduled to be unloaded in the evening. However, around 1:00 AM, while the captain was still asleep, a Baiguan boat collided with it violently. The Lutan boat itself was already old, and after this impact, the caulking in the hull cracked and water immediately began to seep in. By the time the boat owner Jiang Ayao and the crew were awakened and cried for help, nearby small boats rushed to the rescue. They rescued six or seven crew members from the Lutan boat and salvaged over a hundred bags of rice before the boat sank to the bottom of the water. The sunken sailboat drifted with the tide to the riverbed in front of the Jiangdong branch of the Bank of Communications. It had previously bumped into the "Jingsheng" wheel and broke one of its iron chains. The sunken rice, besides the hundred or so bags salvaged by the small boatmen, was also salvaged by the Chinese Salvage Company hired to salvage the Jingsheng wheel.</p>
<h3>US Citizens Form "War Damage Claims Group"; US Authorities' Attitude is Temporarily Unwilling to Take Action; Group Takes Further Steps</h3>
<p>Due to the significant property losses suffered by American citizens as a result of the Sino-Japanese War, a group of US citizens has begun negotiations with the Japanese military and is seeking to organize a "War Damage Claims Group" to obtain an accurate figure for future negotiations. The group will investigate the actual extent of the damages and demand compensation from the Japanese side. The US Consulate in this city is unwilling to take action on this matter. To further its work, the group has scheduled a second meeting today to announce the number of committee members, which is reportedly set at thirty to forty people.</p>

<h3>Gao Xinbao's Murder Being Investigated; Bullet Trajectory Being Studied; Gao Was an Ardent Supporter of the Government and Refused to Participate in "Bandit Territory" Activities</h3>
<p>The "Continental Daily News" reports that Gao Xinbao, the owner of a dance hall, was shot and killed by thugs on Yuqiaqing Road on the night of the 15th of this month. The Public Concession Police Department is investigating, but there are still no leads. According to the autopsy yesterday (the 16th), Gao's body had three bullet wounds. A firearms expert from the Police Department is studying the bullets that killed Gao to determine if the murder weapon is registered with the Police Department. The results of the study will be known on the 18th. According to Gao's friends, his refusal to participate in "bandit territory" activities was the motive for his murder. Up until last week, people from the bandit territory were still asking Gao for financial assistance. Gao firmly refused, threatening them with the severest punishment. It is reported that Gao usually ardently supported the Chinese government. In the early autumn, he was accused by the Japanese of being involved in guerrilla activities in the Shanghai area, resulting in his detention by the Police Department, but he was soon released.</p>
<h3>Funeral Held Yesterday</h3>
<p>Gao Huaide, President of the Lido Sports Association, passed away from injuries sustained on the evening of the 15th in front of the Yipinxiang Inn on Yuqiaqing Road. Details were reported previously. Gao's remains were sent to the Central Funeral Home that evening. On the day before yesterday, the First Special District Local Court sent officials to inspect the body, and yesterday the funeral was held. Gao had a wide circle of friends during his lifetime, so mourners filled Mabai Road yesterday. The funeral arrangements were elaborate and solemn. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>White Carriages and Horses</p>
<p>Those who came to pay their respects yesterday were all friends, relatives, and students of Gao. Notable figures such as Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Ludeng, Madam Du, Xu Shihao, Yang Shunquan, Bian Ruixin, Zhang Jiguang, Guo Baoshu, Wang Yaotang, Li Zugu, Zhu Rushan, Gan Jingxian, Wu Linkun, Chen Qiwei, Kui Yanfang, Sheng Zecheng, Ding Fubao, Zhang Shankun, Jiang Yiping, Jin Tingsun, Zhong Kecheng, Wu Deru, Cai Futang, Gu Cuixiang, and others all personally came to pay their respects, totaling over a thousand people. Several of his closest old friends wept loudly over the coffin, and their cries, along with those of his family, shook heaven and earth.</p>
<p>Heartbreaking Scene</p>
<p>Gao left behind six orphans and also had grandchildren. His eldest son, Shangde, graduated from St. John's University, while the youngest is still in diapers. His mother is still alive, over seventy years old, and in frail health. Therefore, the tragic incident was kept secret from her until yesterday afternoon. The old woman's love for her son was profound. Seeing the tragic scene in the mourning hall, she wept bitterly, which was heartbreaking. Although Gao was not wealthy, thousands of people depended on him for their livelihood. The International Relief Association presented a plaque that read "The Star of the Community Has Fallen," and the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association's plaque read "Benefiting the Refugees," which were not exaggerations.</p>
<p>Bullets Unrecoverable</p>
<p>When Gao was shot, the thugs fired a total of four shots. The first bullet hit his waist, a vital point. The second bullet hit the No. 11311 car. The last two bullets hit his head and left leg. The three bullets that hit his body were unrecoverable. There were only entry wounds on the body, indicating that they were still inside. However, a thorough search yielded nothing. The court examined the body on the day before yesterday, searching with X-rays and performing surgery, but nothing was found. Therefore, firearms experts from the police are currently examining Gao's car and the bullet that hit the car body to study whether it was a chemical reaction or whether it was fired from a gun that is already recorded by the police. The results will be known soon.</p>
<p>Gao's Brief Biography</p>
<p>Gao was a native of Shanghai, 46 years old (the ages listed in various newspapers are incorrect). He was a generous and upright person, with the spirit of Mencius, had a wide circle of friends, kept his promises, and was particularly fond of giving. During the January 28th Incident, he organized a wounded soldier's hospital, which was a great success. During the August 13th Incident, he again used his Lido as a medical facility for wounded soldiers. At that time, refugees were everywhere, and he generously donated money without hesitation. He contributed significantly to charitable causes. Recently, he founded the Lido Sports Association and was engaged in commerce. Unfortunately, just as the scale was being established, he suddenly met with misfortune, which is deeply mourned.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Westside Gambling Dens Decline; Gambling Dens Close Down; Rongsheng Gambling Den Already Sold</h3>
<p>The gambling dens in Shanghai's westside are now declining. The neon lights and eye-catching posters that used to adorn the entrances of every gambling den are no longer lit or posted. The disputes over gambling taxes have made it difficult for the gambling dens, and with the signing of the Road Extension Agreement, the special police are about to be established, and the gambling dens will be forced to close. The previously bustling gamblers are now few in number, and business has slumped. It is reported that the owners of the gambling dens are now seeking other avenues. For example, Shao Liangeng, the owner of the Rongsheng gambling den on Yanping Road, has recently sold all of his assets and is planning to change his business. Other gambling dens, such as Fusheng and Guangsheng, have already been closed for many days. Zhao Lan, Hollywood, Broadway, Qiuyuan, and other gambling dens are also preparing to close. However, all the gambling den owners have become rich overnight. (Another report) Shao Liangeng, a Wuxi native who owns one of the largest gambling dens in Shanghai's westside, the "Rongsheng Club," has made huge profits since its founding. It is reported that Shao does not intend to continue operating the club and recently, a week ago, sold all of the assets of Rongsheng to a Macau gambler for 550,000 yuan. 250,000 yuan has already been paid, and the remaining 300,000 yuan will be paid after the official transfer. It is also reported that after completing the formalities, Shao plans to go to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Collision on Huangpu River; Bodies Recovered</h3>
<p>Regarding the case of the Nisshin Shipping Company's (formerly Toa Shipping) new port liner, Taiko Maru, colliding with and sinking the puppet "Water Patrol Team Shanghai No. 10 Ferry" at Lujiazui, Huangpu River, while leaving the port at around 11:00 PM on the 15th, details were published in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that in addition to the seven Chinese and Japanese victims mentioned yesterday, Huang Junhou, a puppet "Social Bureau Secretary," also died in the river, bringing the total number of drowned to eight. Yesterday, the Japanese military police, the puppet "Water Patrol Team," and the families of the deceased hired boats to search the river. All of the bodies of the Japanese military police have been recovered by the Japanese military police. Also recovered were the bodies of Zhuang Jinlong (31 years old, local), the coxswain of the Water Patrol Team ferry, Wang Ajin (16 years old, local), a deckhand, Zhang Shunjin (52 years old, local), and Huang Junhou (22 years old, Tianjin, married just two weeks ago), the puppet "Social Bureau Secretary." Yesterday, the four Chinese bodies were lying in a makeshift thatched shed at the Hongsheng Wharf in Pudong. Zhao Afa (27 years old, Nanjing), the captain, and a female puppet "police officer" (a woman with a pockmarked face who had recently been promoted to "patrol leader" and had gone to Hongkou that day to thank the person who recommended her for the promotion) were still missing as of last night. The captain of the Taiko Maru, who caused the accident, is Japanese, not Chinese, and is currently detained in the Japanese Maritime Military Police Station at the Beijing Road Wharf. His future fate is unknown.</p>
<p>According to foreign sources, the Japanese side issued a report today regarding the incident in which the Japanese Taiko Maru collided with and sank a ferry in the Huangpu River the night before yesterday. According to the report, at 0:10 AM yesterday (the 16th), Japanese military police Sergeant Kuroki Shigeo, accompanied by Yamazaki and seven Chinese, were traveling on the puppet "Shanghai Municipal Government" Ferry No. 10 to Pudong. About 600 meters from the Pudong wharf, the Taiko Maru, sailing between Shanghai and the new port, passed by at high speed. The small vessel could not avoid the ship and a collision occurred. The Japanese military police sergeant was a skilled swimmer and survived, but one Japanese is still missing.</p>

<h3>The Most Advanced Treatment for Nocturnal Emission - Helping Those Harmed by Masturbation</h3>
<p>— Dr. Yang Daonan, Graduate of Medical Science from a Russian Labor University</p>
<p>Most young people who masturbate are tempted by their environment. Prolonged nocturnal emission leads to various debilitating ailments.</p>
<p>Although nocturnal emission is not solely caused by masturbation, a considerable number of people suffer severe harm due to masturbation. In the eyes of us doctors, the reason why young people tend to masturbate is mostly due to environmental temptation. Furthermore, young people who enjoy reading obscene books and looking at lewd pictures are generally unreliable. Secondly, they are compelled by physiological factors. Those who have reached a certain age but still have a foreskin are easily induced to masturbate by the stimulation of secretions accumulated in the foreskin. Masturbation arouses sexual excitement, leading to a rise in lustful desires, clouded minds, and inevitably, nocturnal emission and insomnia.</p>
<p>Regarding the harm of masturbation, people with some general medical knowledge know that it is the root cause of weakened brain nerves and sexual function. Why is this so? Because masturbation relies solely on unnatural fantasy, concentrating all attention on one point, causing erotic fantasies to arise in the brain. Therefore, it easily fatigues the brain nerves, resulting in damage to the brain, causing symptoms such as dizziness, brain swelling, tinnitus, and forgetfulness. At the same time, the erection and ejaculation functions are also disrupted by masturbation, losing their normal state. Hence, sometimes even a slight impulse during the day can lead to spermatorrhea. Overall health deteriorates, complexion becomes pale, development is incomplete, and symptoms such as kidney deficiency, premature ejaculation, impotence, and infertility are almost entirely formed by this incurable affliction. Without active treatment, there is no guarantee of life, which is extremely dangerous.</p>
<p>Based on my years of experience in treating this type of disease, the German testicular essence preparation "Vigophos" for men is most effective in treating masturbation-induced injuries, neurasthenia, incomplete development, brain weakness, and kidney deficiency. However, in cases of frequent nocturnal emission, "Naldes Nocturnal Emission Pills" should be used first to stop the emission. In short, those with this type of disease should take both medications together. During the day, take two tablets of "Vigophos" three times a day. Before bed, take three tablets of "Naldes Nocturnal Emission Pills." Then, any severe nocturnal emission, spermatorrhea, neurasthenia, incomplete development, kidney deficiency, impotence, and other symptoms will be cured. "Vigophos" is divided into male and female versions, with the female version being an ovarian endocrine preparation with the function of regulating menstruation and promoting conception.</p>
<h3>The Key to Treating Lung Disease</h3>
<p>— Dr. Sheng Zaiqiang</p>
<p>The lungs are an unconscious organ, so when they are invaded by tuberculosis bacteria, there is no awareness. Even if erosion forms cavities, there is no specific pain. Only when tuberculosis bacteria attack the pleura, causing pleurisy, is there a sensation of stabbing pain in the chest. Or, pleurisy may lead to fluid accumulation in the chest cavity, or tuberculous meningitis may lead to death. Therefore, in treating lung disease, one should pay attention to nourishment, such as good air circulation and sufficient sunlight. Regarding diet, one should especially consume nutritious and easily digestible foods. One should also avoid stimulants such as tobacco and alcohol. The main aspect is to use the special lung disease medication, "Pulmotone", to increase calcium in the lungs and kill tuberculosis bacteria. Therefore, lung disease, no matter what stage, can be completely cured. Thus, it is no coincidence that "Pulmotone" is popular in various countries.</p>

<h3>The Great Purge of Gonococcal Poison</h3>
<p>— Dr. Huang Zhongchang, American Medical Doctor</p>
<p>Because of its extremely strong contagiousness, gonorrhea spreads very quickly. In society, regardless of the poor or rich, there are gonorrhea patients mixed among us. This point alone is enough to see the great harm gonorrhea inflicts on humanity. The history of gonorrhea is not a recent phenomenon, but has a long history alongside humanity, so its harm to humanity is very great. And in the end, there has been no way to conquer it. Speaking of the causative bacteria of gonorrhea, its viability is worth mentioning first. The gonococcus is a bacterium that reproduces extremely quickly. Its shape is like two spheres stacked together, hence the name diplococcus. Generally, what harms our patients is not the gonococcus itself, but the toxins produced by the gonococcus, which infiltrate the mucous membrane, causing inflammation and swelling, resulting in concrete gonorrhea. Furthermore, because the gonococcus spreads to various places, it causes various lesions in those places. This is the origin of gonococcal complications. To eradicate gonorrhea, killing the bacteria is of course necessary, but purging the toxins of the gonococcus is also not to be ignored.</p>
<p>To achieve such a fundamental solution to the problem of gonorrhea, the use of bactericidal, anti-gonococcal, and detoxifying gonococcal therapy is essential. To achieve this goal, it is also essential to adopt the latest gonorrhea-specific drug that has been invented. Based on my experience, the latest gonorrhea-specific drug "Neo-Clinon" invented by Dr. Peter of Germany is highly effective. This agent is made using the finest ingredients of the latest chemical therapy, removing reactive impurities, and made by scientific methods. After taking it, it can automatically generate an anti-gonococcal and detoxifying effect in gonorrhea patients and has analgesic effects. Therefore, "Neo-Clinon" can cure all cases of acute gonorrhea at the onset, inflammation of the anterior urethra, inflammation spreading to the posterior urethra, and posterior urethritis, as well as cases where the infection spreads to the genitals, urinary organs, and blood, causing prostatitis, orchitis, and cystitis.</p>
<h3>Cases of Curing Kidney Deficiency, Physical Weakness, and Incomplete Development</h3>
<p>— Dr. Zheng Da, German Medical Doctor</p>
<p>Patient Xie Zhimin, 34 years old, from Pukou, Jiangsu Province, (self-described): In recent years, I have made many mistakes in my work, my thoughts are bad, I have profuse night sweats, insomnia, and headaches. I feel deeply distressed. (Disease history) - As a child, I was tempted by classmates to masturbate in the dormitory, but I stopped after a while. Later, after marriage, I overindulged in sexual activity for about three years. My body became more and more tired. My genitals are small, and my relationship with my wife is weak. Although I have been married for three years, I still have no children. I beg for treatment. (Treatment process) - First, I prescribed the German seminal emission medicine "Naldes Nocturnal Emission Pills" to stop the emission, and gave him electrotherapy for fifteen minutes every day. At the same time, I administered the "Vigophos" endocrine supplement three times a day to replenish his deficiency. In this way, with both internal and external care, after one month, the seminal emission had completely stopped. His appetite also increased, his spirits were uplifted, his complexion became rosy, and he slept soundly at night. He could have stopped taking the medication, but because Mr. Xie wanted to fully restore the development of his genitals, he continued to take "Vigophos" internally. After half a year, his erections were firm and his genitals lengthened. Recently, he sent a letter saying so.</p>

<h3>The Causes and Consequences of Urethral Gonorrhea</h3>
<p>— Written by Dr. Yao Juyan</p>
<p>Clinic: Ningbo Road</p>
<p>Intersection of Sichuan Road, No. 9</p>
<p>Once infected with gonorrhea, the initial gonococci mostly parasitize in the anterior urethra. At this time, if the gonococci are swept away with lightning speed, the gonococci that have not yet gained a foothold will have no way to struggle and will be wiped out in one fell swoop. However, if this kind of bacteria is not vigorously eliminated at this time, all kinds of changes will arise from this. In general, the gonococci of the anterior urethra are commonly seen in the prodromal stage of gonorrhea. When it goes from the prodromal stage to the acute stage, the gonococci are no longer confined to the anterior urethra and have entered the posterior urethra, and all kinds of complications are increasing, and treatment is more difficult than in the prodromal stage. The reason why gonorrhea caused by gonococci in the anterior urethra is easy to eradicate is that the anterior urethra has no complex structure physiologically. Therefore, treatment is very easy. If the gonococci have invaded the posterior urethra, although treatment is more difficult, if the gonococci have not yet invaded the urinary system, internal reproductive system, or blood circulation system, the root cause is still not very difficult to eradicate. But if it has become gonococcal cystitis, prostatitis, orchitis, arthritis, etc., it is tantamount to indicating that the patient's gonorrhea has invaded these systems. The treatment is not only more difficult than anterior urethritis, but also more difficult than posterior urethritis. All of the above are the causes and consequences of untreated gonococcal urethritis. And the only treatment is to take the gonorrhea-specific chemotherapeutic drug "Neo-Clinon" (available at both Taihe and Wing On Companies) to have any hope of eradication. Because the range of gonococci that have spread from the anterior urethra to the three major systems is wide, it is absolutely impossible to complete the task of expelling the gonococci with a piece-by-piece local operation. I also use German static electricity therapy to help the bactericidal power of "Neo-Clinon" to be fully exerted. Clinic hours: 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM. From today, 20 patients will be seen daily. Each number will only cost five dimes and will include a free copy of the "Complete Book of Sexually Transmitted Diseases" worth one dollar.</p>
<h3>Real Zuo Bi - Fortune Telling and Sutra Explaining, Third Session - Ancient and Modern Marriage Divination</h3>
<p>"Zuo Zhuan" records in the early part of the 22nd year of Duke Zhuang that Yi Shi divined about marrying his daughter to Jing Zhong. The divination was auspicious, saying, "It is like a phoenix flying together, their harmonious calls are clear and loud." "Zhen Zuo Bi notes" Ancient marriage divination was decided by divination. Today's matchmaking always involves analyzing the stems and branches of both parties, forming eight characters. First, one discusses whether there is mutual generation or conflict. Then, one determines the wife's husband star, descendants, longevity, food and clothing, virtue, frugality, as well as her fortune... Using this, one can determine the fate of their lifelong marriage. If the results match, I do not boast of being a seasoned matchmaker. However, I am meticulous and spare no effort in divination and selecting auspicious dates for marriage. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>The Core of Soaring Prices in Shanghai and Countermeasures</h3>
<p>— Tao Gongwen</p>
<p>Everyone feels the constant pressure of rising prices in daily life. In February of this year, the living expenses of workers in Shanghai increased by an average of almost three times compared to the same month last year. The extent of price increases is thus imaginable.</p>
<p>Shanghai Worker Living Expenses Index Table</p>
<p>The soaring prices in Shanghai directly oppress the city's common people. However, when a portion of essential goods from the interior still rely on Shanghai for supply, the people of the interior inevitably suffer from the indirect oppression of Shanghai's soaring prices. Therefore, the sharp rise in prices in this city, while not giving our national policy a serious blow, will at least have a considerable adverse impact. Therefore, not only the common people and local authorities in Shanghai deeply hope that prices will tend towards a reasonable level and that necessary measures should be taken, but also our highest authorities are unlikely to be unconcerned about the rising prices in Shanghai.</p>
<p>To stabilize prices in Shanghai, we must first investigate the reasons for their sharp rise. Regarding the reasons for the sharp rise in prices, opinions vary depending on individual viewpoints, and proposals also differ. Summarizing, there seem to be three main arguments:</p>
<p>(1) The legal tender (fabi) has already experienced excessive inflation, resulting in a drastic drop in purchasing power;</p>
<p>(2) Due to the special environment of Shanghai, the quantity of goods imported into Shanghai has drastically decreased;</p>
<p>(3) Rampant speculation has led to a sharp increase in the demand for goods.</p>
<p>Let's first examine whether the legal tender has indeed experienced excessive inflation. According to a telegram from Chongqing on January 17, the amount of legal tender issued by the four major banks (Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Communications Bank, and Farmers Bank of China) was 3,081,787,295 yuan, an increase of one-fold compared to the issuance of 1,511,714,642 yuan when the "August 13th" war broke out. However, from a national perspective, the actual circulation of our legal tender has not increased as much as the amount issued due to the following reasons:</p>
<p>(1) A portion of the increased legal tender is used to replace the provincial currency and silver coins that have been withdrawn;</p>
<p>(2) In reality, a portion of the legal tender has been destroyed by artillery fire or has been lost and will no longer circulate in the market;</p>
<p>(3) Because banks retain more deposit reserves during times of emergency than in peacetime; the legal tender used for these deposit reserves will definitely not flow into society unless a bank run occurs;</p>
<p>(4) The lending policies of banks are now more cautious than usual, so the opportunity for lending is relatively reduced. Of the deposits received, in addition to retaining a portion as deposit reserves, a portion still cannot be lent out and remains idle in the vaults;</p>
<p>(5) Bank depositors, having learned the lesson of two restrictions on withdrawals, fear that the government will impose a third restriction. They would rather take some risks and keep more cash on hand, so the amount of legal tender locked away in people's safes or wallets has also increased compared to normal times.</p>
<p>The amount issued is not the same as the amount in circulation. Due to the above reasons, it can be seen that the amount issued has not been excessively inflated. In addition, inconvenient transportation in various regions, scarce trade, and the abnormal state of financial regulatory institutions in various regions further preclude any discussion of expansion in its speed of circulation or volume of circulation. However, this is from a national perspective; the situation in this city is relatively different. Because in addition to legal tender, there are other currencies, such as checks, drafts, and remittance instruments. More importantly, funds from the occupied areas and Hong Kong are gradually concentrating in Shanghai, without any reasonable investment, allowing them to float in the market. Therefore, in terms of circulation, it seems to have expanded considerably compared to before, which seems undeniable. But this is not the most important reason. If it maintains a balanced relationship with the supply and demand of goods, in other words: if its circulation speed can indeed maintain a balanced relationship with the normal volume of commercial transactions, then the increase in the amount of currency is a phenomenon that should exist in a prosperous market. In this case, we should examine the supply and demand relationship of goods in Shanghai. After Guangzhou, Shantou, Xiamen, and other places fell one after another, there was indeed a panic about the supply of goods in Shanghai. Now, attracted by the high prices in Shanghai, the quantity of goods supplied to Shanghai from the occupied areas and the interior may have actually increased considerably compared to before. In terms of transportation conditions, there have been no drastic changes in China's coastal transportation, and international transportation has even become somewhat smoother due to the relaxation of naval warfare. Goods from the United Kingdom, the United States, and other countries are still flowing in steadily. The problem is that all goods coming from the occupied areas must first be subject to the control of a certain party. This control is undoubtedly one of the direct causes of the increase in the price of goods.</p>
<p>Shanghai was originally China's largest speculative market. Especially today, when the state's ruling power has temporarily lost its position in Shanghai, the speculative atmosphere is becoming increasingly prosperous. After the outbreak of the European War, the gold that had fled from China to Hong Kong returned to Shanghai along with the concentration of funds from the occupied areas. According to a report in this newspaper on the 8th, the floating capital in Shanghai is at least 300 billion yuan, of which 50% is in current deposits in various banks, 10% is invested in emerging businesses in western Shanghai, and the remaining 40% is excess capital flowing into speculation. Moreover, at least half of the current deposits held by various banks can also flow into speculation. The main targets of speculation are (1) hoarding daily necessities, such as rice, flour, coal, and cloth, (2) buying and selling foreign exchange and foreign currency, (3) buying and selling gold, (4) buying and selling stocks and bonds, (5) engaging in remittance discounts and arbitrage. Due to the rampant speculative atmosphere, the demand for goods has shown an irrational surge. Although a large amount of foreign rice is imported, the price of rice still maintains an upward trend. The coal reserves are still ample, but the price of coal is still rising. This clearly proves that speculators are at work, causing the supply and demand of goods to lose balance.</p>
<p>In summary, the core of the recent soaring prices in Shanghai is the considerable expansion of the currency supply in this city, the monopolization of the source of goods, and the prevalence of various types of speculation. But for the price stabilization policies that can be implemented at present, perhaps we can only shrink the amount of currency in this city, manage the capital activities in this city, and crack down on speculative behavior to balance the supply and demand of goods.</p>
<p>Shrinking the amount of currency in Shanghai is indeed not an easy task. In the current situation, Shanghai is still a "comfortable haven" for capital, and floating capital from all sides is flowing into Shanghai like a tide. To reduce the amount of floating capital in Shanghai, it is necessary to establish better investment places than Shanghai, and then the floating capital of this port will flow there. Then, where should better investment places be established? Needless to say, it is of course the southwest and northwest of our country. The highest authorities have long formulated preferential measures for people to invest in construction projects in the interior, giving the funds invested in the interior a solid guarantee and preferential interest rates. However, the floating capital in Shanghai still remains in Shanghai. Therefore, to reduce the amount of speculation by Shanghai's floating capital, we must look to the banking industry to manage its capital utilization on its own. Such as raising loan interest rates, restricting collateral lending, etc.</p>
<p>Speaking of cracking down on speculative behavior, in the current special environment, it is feared that it will be difficult to achieve results solely through government orders and local authority announcements. It is also necessary to rely on the cooperation of trade associations and the banking industry. The retribution that speculators deserve will surely come upon them sooner or later. However, while they are still thoroughly enlightened by the lessons of facts and are still immersed in speculative behavior, members of the same industry should mutually restrain speculation by people within the industry and speculation by people outside the industry engaged in the industry. When lending money, the banking industry should not only consider the creditworthiness of the borrower, but also investigate the use of the funds. If you are worried that the funds cannot be lent out, I think it is better to reduce deposit interest rates, or the banking industry should promote credit cooperation for the living expenses of ordinary people. The best thing is to automatically find ways to invest in the interior. As for trade associations, they are now starting to crack down on speculative behavior. The organized briquette industry trade association, the flour mill trade association; the banking industry has also raised lending interest rates to prevent speculation by borrowing money for hoarding. We hope that other trade associations will also unite to stop speculation and take more effective and stricter preventive measures than those currently taken by the above two trade associations. At the same time, we place great hopes on the price stabilization plans and determination of the authorities of the two concessions.</p>
<p>Price of Goods in Chongqing</p>
<p>According to a survey by the Southwest Economic Research Institute: Since the war, the price of goods in Chongqing has risen sharply. The increase in food prices is shown in the following table:</p>
<p>(Note) 26.7 years is the average price for June; 28 years is the average price for November. Unit: Yuan.</p>
<h3>Soaring Prices and the Problem of Balancing Prices</h3>
<p>— Liu Zhizhi</p>
<p>What are the general causes of prices in various parts of China at present? To summarize, I am afraid it will not go beyond the following points:</p>
<p>(1) The establishment of the black market for foreign exchange. The activity of the black market has led to a decline in foreign exchange, prompting an increase in the price of imported goods, which indirectly raised the prices of some domestic goods.</p>
<p>(2) Reduced production. The expansion of the war zone has naturally affected production and reduced it. Even those who can still work are limited by environmental factors and cannot produce in large quantities.</p>
<p>(3) Imbalance of supply and demand. Today, China's industry and commerce, on the one hand, cannot carry out large-scale manufacturing and mass production to supply the society, and on the other hand, the people's enjoyment of material life has not been reduced due to frugality. In this way, it is impossible to say that the two aspects of supply and demand are balanced, and in this situation of demand exceeding supply, how can prices not increase?</p>
<p>(4) Transportation difficulties and increased taxes and risks along the way. The inconvenience of transportation has made prices lose their regulatory balance. This has always been a major and serious problem in China. Moreover, today, many important industrial and commercial areas have successively become war zones due to the aggressor's control and various difficulties. Therefore, there are many obstacles and thorns in transportation regulation, and when you want to transport goods from Place A to Place B, the unpredictable risks encountered along the way are even greater. In this way, after enduring the utmost danger, the price of industrial and commercial products will be greatly increased.</p>
<p>(5) Controlled and lacking sources. Regarding this aspect, it is indeed one of the important reasons for the current soaring prices in general, and it is also the most worthy of people's attention. Because in China's already occupied areas, there are many production areas for industrial and commercial raw materials, but today, after being occupied by the other side, they will definitely do their best to plunder, and even monopolize all of them. In this way, the source of goods will naturally be scarce, and how can prices not be expensive? As proof, the situation of the soaring prices in the Shanghai soybean oil market before the summer vacation last year, the prices of rice and grain in Shanghai after the new grain in various parts of the country entered the market, not only did not decrease, but instead continued to rise day by day. All of these are because soybeans and rice were specially noticed by the Japanese, and all of them were completely prohibited from being transported to Shanghai.</p>
<p>(6) Merchants hoarding and speculating, deliberately manipulating. Regarding this point, it is indeed one of the reasons for the current increase in prices in various places. Especially in Shanghai, where China's political power cannot reach today, the situation is even more terrible.</p>
<p>(7) The relationship of the population concentrated in one corner. The concentration of the population in one corner, causing prices to soar, is a major example in Shanghai.</p>
<p>(8) The instability of market psychology. As for the reasons why market psychology is unstable, it is also entirely due to a small number of powerful industrialists and businessmen spreading many unfounded rumors that deliberately dazzle the public's ears and eyes, hoping to take advantage of this to manipulate the market in order to satisfy their personal insatiable desires.</p>
<p>In addition, the increased costs of production of goods in other aspects, such as the acceptance of goods as collateral for loans by some banking industries, are all related to the soaring prices of all goods today.</p>
<p>Various Plans to Stabilize Prices</p>
<p>The result of the domestic prices continuing to increase without restriction will inevitably affect the weakening of national purchasing power. If this rising trend is allowed to continue unabated without seeking ways to curb it, it will directly and indirectly cause serious panic in the lives of the people and will also promote social disorder and the inability to maintain law and order.</p>
<p>However, although the Chinese government has long been determined to control wartime prices, it is ultimately limited by the environment. Because, in terms of price control policies, many European and American industrialized countries have implemented them and achieved results. However, my country is an agricultural country, and is different from foreign countries in terms of politics, economy, and other aspects. Moreover, due to the lack of accurate and detailed statistics, it is naturally inconvenient to cite the methods used by foreign countries. Moreover, even if we imitate and implement them, I am afraid that we may not see so much success. Then, the several implementation measures that can be adopted for the problem of balancing prices at the present time are natural prices and cracking down on speculative manipulation methods, and ordering local organizations to form price stabilization committees to bear the burden of setting prices for the necessities of life for the people. Moreover, in the price stabilization measures promulgated by the government this time, there are also three standards worth citing by our people, namely: (1) For items whose production and sales costs have not been affected by the war or have been slightly affected, the average price of the three or one year before the war shall prevail. (2) For items whose production and sales costs have been affected by the war, the standard shall be the cost after the war plus the appropriate profit. (3) For items whose costs are not easy to calculate, the standard shall be the total amount of capital invested in their business, plus a considerable profit, and it is stipulated that the items for balancing prices are limited to daily necessities.</p>
<p>The organization of the price stabilization committee is jointly organized by local governments, provincial banks, local banks, and local chambers of commerce and trade associations. Its responsibility is to assess the selling prices of daily necessities for the people, and it also stipulates three items of regulations that violate this standard. Anyone who violates these three items of regulations may file a complaint with the court.</p>
<p>However, in Shanghai, because of the special environment, of course, in addition to complying with the laws and regulations promulgated by the government, we must also work hard to exhaust the following points. In this way, there will be hope for the future dawn of the problem of balancing prices.</p>
<p>(1) The authorities of the two concessions should jointly establish a strong price stabilization committee with the city's public organizations, trade associations, and influential people in society to conduct mutual discussions and come up with the most effective price control plan.</p>
<p>(2) For several types of goods in terms of daily necessities, such as rice, flour, briquettes, etc., the trade associations should be ordered and instructed to instruct each member firm not to engage in illegal and irregular transactions, so as to avoid suspicion of manipulation and hoarding. Those who do not comply with the order shall be referred to the general meeting for disciplinary action, and shall be subject to the highest severe punishment or fine by the court.</p>
<p>(3) For those items that originally had regulatory associations, their internal organization should be strengthened and their responsibilities and powers should be exercised externally.</p>
<p>(4) I sincerely hope that the members of the banking industry can transfer huge amounts of funds, pay them in advance, and jointly with various public organizations in the society, order huge amounts of daily necessities from abroad to expand and sustain the scope and time of price stabilization, so as to further benefit the masses.</p>
<p>(5) I sincerely hope that all newspapers and organs that speak for the people will do their best to supervise public opinion and seek to expose all kinds of conspiracies and the truth within, so that every profiteer will know that there is a need to be careful and cautious.</p>
<p>(6) All citizens should work together in harmony, labor and management should conspire, unite and cooperate, and remain calm in the face of the coming great changes. In this way, we will avoid being saddened by our loved ones and pleased by our enemies.</p>
<p>In addition, on the other hand, for balancing prices, I hope that all sectors can establish a public price and control consumption for all kinds of goods in terms of the people's daily necessities, and must force the people to comply. In addition, we should also pay attention to the large-scale increase in production and communication in transportation work. Moreover, we should inform the people that everyone can automatically get up to save consumption and cherish goods, in order to adjust the supply and demand of goods in equilibrium and prevent prices from rising again.</p>
<h3>Sino-Japanese Trade in Hardware</h3>
<p>— Wang Yizhi</p>
<p>Hardware is a major raw material for military industrial industries; however, Japan relies solely on overseas imports for the supply of this raw material, and most of it comes from the United States. Now that the United States and Japan are in an era of no business, the raw material problem of Japan's military industrial industries is particularly noteworthy.</p>
<p>According to the US announcement, the percentage of important raw materials recently supplied by the US to Japan for combat needs is shown in the table below. From the previous table, it can be seen that Japan's economic and even combat capabilities are deeply dependent on the United States. Let us further describe the situation of Sino-Japanese trade in hardware. However, since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the Japanese government has kept secret the import figures of important goods such as various raw materials and materials related to the military industrial industry. Therefore, the actual situation can only be imagined from the pre-war state.</p>
<p>From the table below, it can be seen that at that time, Japan's hardware raw materials did not seem to be entirely supplied by the United States. However, after the outbreak of the European War, all of its original suppliers had to switch to supplying their own use, or were purchased nearby by the European belligerents. Therefore, Japan has no other source except the United States. Commercial News</p>
<h3>Foodstuffs: Rice Prices Plummet More and More Fiercely; Yesterday, Prices in All Markets Plunged by One or Two Yuan; Business Closed Every Week Starting April 10</h3>
<p>The rice market has been declining since this month and has been depreciating day by day. Although there have been several rebounds in the middle, it has always been high and then low, nothing more than a large drop and a small rebound. Taking the highest peak of 52 yuan for the current Geng Hongpan No. 1 Saigon as an example, it has fallen below the closing price of 43 yuan at the end of last year. One after another, the slump has reached as much as 10 yuan. Such a tired phenomenon is indeed unprecedented in the rice market. In short, things will turn when they reach their extreme, and prosperity will decline when they reach their peak. This is the constant principle of heaven. When the price of rice soared unexpectedly, the reaction was also fierce, beyond the ordinary. However, according to the current rice market, in terms of pricing, it seems to be low. After its over-selling, there may be some wandering and rebound. However, things went against expectations. Not only was there no hope of standing firm, but it fell more and more sharply. Yesterday, trading throughout the city felt even more deserted. General guests all saw their hands shrink back. In the morning, there was no inquiry at all. It was not until nearly 10:30 in the morning that the floating tenement householders were eager to sell and threw it off again, suddenly falling by one yuan before there was any action. However, it was still not smooth. Moreover, the original root guest vendors also sold each other lightly because of the congestion of arrivals and the heavier silver roots, resulting in no improvement in the rear sales market and frequent price declines. If No. 1 Saigon initially opened at 41 yuan and 50 cents, it was only sold at 40 yuan and 8 cents here. The fire twist initially sold for 40 yuan and 5 cents, and later sold for 40 yuan to 39 yuan and a half. Fortunately, after this "throw", there were some wholesale transactions, and retail sales were also more. Therefore, it was able to stand a little until the market closed. However, the closing price plummeted by another one and a half to nearly two yuan compared to before. All other goods were similar. The closing price of Xiaowen was 37 yuan to 36 yuan and a half, No. 2 Saigon was 37 yuan and a half to 37 yuan, No. 2 Siam was 37 yuan, crushed tip was 33 yuan to 30 yuan, and the glutinous rice market fell by one fall at this time, also cutting the yuan Xu. Thick and thin japonica and other national rice outside the market, the secret price did not fall by about one yuan.</p>
<p>Attached news, the matter of the rice market closing on Sundays has been resolved by the association yesterday. The announcement will be approved starting from the first Sunday of April 7, and thereafter, business will be closed for one day every Sunday.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Ice Flower Green Soars</h3>

The price of Taikoo Che Bai Xi Zhan B mark was 67 yuan and 10 cents, while the price of Dong Zhan goods rose by 20 cents to 66 yuan and 70 cents, and the rest were at the original price.

The special high ice flower Qinggang Bang number house called 60 yuan, and it is said that 50 bags were traded at 58 yuan, but it has not been confirmed.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Southern Gorgon Fruit Tightens</h3>
<p>The arrival and storage of South Tang gorgon fruit is becoming increasingly thin, and the price continues to tighten. For example, the higher quality unified goods have reached 260 yuan, and the second-class goods are 250 yuan. However, the market storage of Chigorgon fruit is relatively thick, and it is seen downstream. The decorated clean good goods are 80 yuan, and the ordinary goods are 70 yuan.</p>

<h3>The Woolen Industry After the Shanghai War</h3>
<p>— Maofang</p>
<p>(1) Introduction</p>
<p>The Shanghai woolen industry has undergone great changes since the "August 13th" Incident. I would like to compile it as follows. When the "August 13th Shanghai War" began, the Shanghai woolen industry all suspended business. It was not until September 1 that business resumed (the Western clothing gang market was earlier). In early October, business officially resumed. At that time, it was still the initial stage of the War of Resistance, and people's hearts were inevitably quite turbulent, not as stable as it is now because the War of Resistance has lasted longer.</p>
<p>(2) Losses of the Shanghai Woolen Industry During the War of Resistance</p>
<p>At the beginning of the "August 13th" Shanghai War, most of the woolen industry was greatly panicked, especially in the Hongkou district. Although many people had moved away a few days earlier, the goods could not be taken out in full, so except for a very small number, none of them suffered great losses. At the end of the twenty-sixth year, in addition to a large decrease in turnover, the accounts could not be settled as scheduled. The accounts receivable in the local and foreign ports were all in a bad state. Other woolen weaving factories, because most of the factory sites were in the Chinese concession and the Hongkou district, several of them also suffered considerable losses.</p>
<p>(3) Deformed Woolen Fabrics</p>
<p>However, in March of the twenty-seventh year, the market situation suddenly changed greatly, and the prices of goods all rose sharply. The main reasons were (1) the government implemented foreign exchange control, resulting in a sharp increase in costs, (2) the lack of arrivals, and because the population of the isolated island increased sharply, the demand was strong, resulting in the woolen industry also becoming a situation of demand exceeding supply under deformed development, and the market continued to rise. Among them, domestic woolen fabrics were even more popular and salable.</p>
<p>(4) The Rise of Speculation Inside and Outside the Industry</p>
<p>Since Shanghai became an isolated island and the population increased, various businesses have developed in a deformed way. Therefore, woolen fabrics have also attracted the attention of hoarding households, who have invested in speculation and absorbed and bought them at all costs. Even more people use methods to manipulate the market and reap huge profits. Because the situation in Shanghai is special, the transportation and sales of woolen fabrics are still the hub. Other things, such as the entry and exit of goods being uniformly paid in cash, the sudden increase in small local machine households, and the transportation of goods mostly taking the route of Hong Kong, Haifang, Wenzhou, and Jinhua, as well as transportation to inland ports, and strict inspections to prevent inferior goods from being mixed in, are all events that occurred after the war.</p>
<p>Market Price, Sunday, March 17, 29 Securities</p>
<p>New York Stocks</p>
<p>New York, 16th. The stock market today. Because of the endless rumors of peace. The market fell again.

<h3>Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek's Hopes for the National Education Conference: Implement the Plan with Courage and Vigor</h3>
<p>(Chongqing, 16th) Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek has four hopes for the National Education Conference: (1) Implement the National Education Plan with courage and vigor. Existing funds and assets should be thoroughly reorganized. Local donations should also be planned according to the circumstances and location. When starting, a firm determination should be established, and a commitment to action should be demonstrated. Once the plan is finalized, it can be implemented gradually and maximize benefits. (2) It is hoped that local gentry and scholars will be motivated to work together to support this initiative. In each province and county, humbly consult with respected individuals to inform them of the steps of implementing national education, the importance of the relationship with the local area, and the central government's determination to achieve this goal. This will encourage them to spread the word or take the lead themselves, creating mutual inspiration and a widespread response. (3) It is hoped that emphasis will be placed on teacher training and practical on-site supervision, raising the self-esteem and sense of responsibility of educators, making them see education as a sacred cause. They should also be willing to travel to various counties or send personnel for regular supervision, which can both provide guidance on implementation methods and help solve local difficulties. (4) Competitive methods should be used judiciously, and the assessment of the effectiveness of national education implementation should be strictly enforced. This is the responsibility of education officials at all levels, as well as administrative officials at all levels. Therefore, assessment standards must be established, practical on-site inspections must be strictly enforced, universality should be sought in establishment, and quality must be ensured in substance. Eliminate the accumulated habit of false reporting and the malpractice of nominal existence without substance. Without fostering assessments, there is no way to uncover deception and urge improvement. If a method of competition between counties and districts can be used judiciously and publicized regularly to provide encouragement, then mutual learning will occur, and the effect will be significant.</p>

<h3>West League First Division Football: Tung Wah Loses Again to West Fords; Two-Nil, Second Half Record</h3>
<p>In yesterday's West League First Division football match, Tung Wah played against West Fords at Jiaozhou Park. Although Jia Youliang played with an injury, they still lost by two goals to nil. The goals were recorded in the second half.</p>
<p>Two Goals Conceded</p>
<p>Wan Jin arrived late, Tung Wah kicked off and attacked. Bing Hao dribbled the ball straight to the front, but failed to score. The Scottish team seized the opportunity to counter-attack. Fraser shot from the middle, Zhang Zhaopeng rescued the danger. Thomson kicked a corner kick, which was well-placed. Bi Gao jumped up to parry the ball. Wan Jin arrived and joined the battle. The forwards were slightly more active, but the wind hindered them, and they did not succeed for a long time. Soon after, the defender Han Wenkai kicked the ball from the goal, hitting Lin Dianhua's arm. Fortunately, Dianhua was outside the penalty area, and a free kick was awarded. Duncan kicked the ball, missing the goal by two feet. The Tung Wah forwards did not fit in, and in the rear defense, the enemy galloped horizontally, creating dangerous situations.</p>
<p>At 31 minutes, the Scottish team's right winger Ross kicked a corner kick. Bi Gao jumped up to rescue, but his eyes were dazzled by the sunlight and he failed to catch the ball. Fraser waited for the ball and gently pushed it in, one-nil. Tung Wah conceded the first goal and tried to retaliate. Gao Baozheng hooked the ball from the baseline, but Lu Fang and Wan Jin both lost their footing. Speirs kicked the ball into a corner kick, which was taken by Lu Fang, but the ball went wide. The Scottish team seized the opportunity to attack. At 40 minutes, Ross made a comeback and shot from 40 yards, hitting the goalpost and bouncing into the net, two-nil, ending the first half.</p>
<p>No Score in Second Half</p>
<p>Changing sides and playing again, Tung Wah put all its effort into counter-attacking and gained the advantage of the wind, and the attack became much better. Wan Jin dribbled the ball into the goal from not far from the goal, but it was disallowed for a foul. The fans in the stands sighed. The Tung Wah players did not slacken their efforts because of this, and the attack became even more rampant. Bing Hao once knocked on the door, but was parried by the goalkeeper Algenson with one hand. Wan Jin shot twice, but both were caught. Losing several opportunities in a row was due to bad luck, not a lack of fighting spirit. Until the end of the game, neither side scored, and the Scottish team won by two goals to nil.</p>
<h3>West Green Women's Volleyball: Min Li and You Xing Win; Three Matches from 7 PM Tonight</h3>
<p>In the seven matches in West Green the day before yesterday, the Min Li and You Xing teams both won in the Chinese women's group. There will be three more matches today, all in Group B.

<p>He Cheng has Li Zhenzhong, Shen Yugong, Xu Zhaoxiong, Chen Xuechong, etc., and Bao Songyuan has recently joined, which can be said to be a complete lineup of the China United team, and its strength should be considered strong. However, the recent condition of the First Division team has been very good. The five-man defense method has reached its peak, and Zhou Qian, Ye Zuyou, and Li Wenru are particularly agile. Therefore, the battle tonight may not necessarily be a defeat. He Cheng will also do its best to compete. This game is undoubtedly one of the most exciting games in silver and banking basketball. In order to prevent crowding, the association requires members of the Lianyi Association to enter the venue with their membership cards.</p>
<h3>Sino-Western Charity Ping Pong Match: West League Lineup Announced</h3>

The West League team includes five countries: England, America, France, Russia, and Judah. However, the players from England, America, and France are not as good as those from Russia and Judah.

In order to enhance its strength, the China United team is currently stepping up training. The match adopts a five-game, three-win system, and the score is calculated by the 21-point tie-break method. The West League team list is as follows:</p>

<h3>Encouraging the Planting of Sweet Potatoes</h3>
<p>In Fujian Province, there are more mountains than fields, and half of the people's food depends on sweet potatoes. Their seeds came from overseas ships, and it is said that they first appeared in the Ming Dynasty. Barren fields, gaps in the land, and areas on hillsides that can be plowed are all suitable for planting. It is estimated that one day's effort can provide half a month's food. There are the most in Fujian, Guangdong, and other places, and some people in Zhejiang also plant them. Ruzhou, Lushan, Songxian, and other counties have already introduced the planting. They have also been seen in the markets of Bian, but they are not as large. If the planting method can be obtained, they will naturally thrive. According to the nature of the scholars in Henan, they are mostly carefree, and planting sweet potatoes is most suitable. Sweet potatoes are also called sweet potatoes, and people in Henan call them sweet potatoes. Fujian and Guangdong have always had this variety. They are round, several inches long, with red skin and white flesh. In recent years, new varieties have been introduced from overseas ships from the Kingdom of Brunei. They are round, with white skin and yellow flesh. Both have milky vines that grow and their roots grow into potatoes underground. They are moist and sweet, non-toxic, replenish the middle and benefit the qi, strengthen the spleen and tonify yin, and have the same effect as potatoes, which is sufficient to serve as food. In the warm lands of the south, the potato heads or old vines are put into the ground in the first month of the year, and they are vigorously watered to make the branches and nodes grow easily, and the vines can be divided and planted during the spring equinox. Henan Province should plant the seeds after the thaw, when it is warm, and watch the seedlings grow large before dividing and planting. In the south, there is a late potato planting in May and June, and all will benefit from it. Early potatoes are gradually dug up after May and June, and all are taken and stored before the frost falls. Potatoes are suitable for high ground, and fertile land does not require fertilizer. For those who choose large areas of garden land and dry land, use large manure to fertilize them before the year. Or if the soil is not sandy, mix it with firewood ash, cow dung, and horse manure to loosen the soil. For consumption, it can be fried, steamed, stewed, boiled, sliced, dried, and boiled. It can also be eaten raw. It can be ground into fine grains and used to make cakes and other things. Steaming and mixing it with noodles to make wine is also fragrant and delicious. One acre of land can yield seventy to eighty dan (a unit of dry measure), which can keep a family of several mouths from starving.</p>

<h3>Lessons from the "Travel" in the Tragic Jingchanghong Steamer Incident</h3>
<p>— Zhang Mengzhao</p>
<p>Without climbing high mountains, you wouldn't know how good it is to walk on flat ground! Without embarking on a journey, how would you know the suffering of wading and crossing the sea? Therefore, as the saying goes, "A mile away from home is not as good as being at home!" However, a man's ambition lies in all directions, so how can he stick to his home and sit in a well, looking at the sky?</p>
<p>This time, the sinking tragedy of the Jingsheng small steamer in Ningbo Port, with more than two hundred people killed, and the sound of wailing was endless, was truly a terrible event in travel. The cause of this tragedy was due to the fact that the person in charge of the steamer did not pay enough attention to limiting the load, and the passengers' panic to board the ship and their lack of order, as well as their lack of alert wisdom to avoid the catastrophe, were also regrettable.</p>
<p>Only "a certain gentleman who escaped death" was very "alert" and good at "adapting." Reading his report, one can know that, according to him: "... On the 2nd (i.e., the 2nd of this month) in the afternoon, I went to the dock to wait for the steamer. At that time, the passengers were already extremely crowded. After the Jingsheng steamer docked, I used all my strength to squeeze into the ship. About half an hour later, I suddenly heard a loud alarm. I saw a Japanese plane passing overhead. Fearing an accident, the ship quickly untied the cable and set sail. The ship gradually left the shore. There were still many passengers who did not have time to board the steamer, so they hired sampans to ferry them to the Jingsheng small steamer. The boatmen used bamboo poles with iron hooks at one end to hook the Jingsheng ship, allowing passengers to climb onto the ship. At that time, the ship was small and there were many people, and the ship was hooked by the boatmen, causing the ship to tilt. The lower cabin gradually flooded... Seeing that the situation was not good, I quickly abandoned my luggage and jumped into another sampan, ordering it to row quickly to the shore... Looking back at the ship from the shore, I only saw a chimney on the water..." and so on.</p>
<p>The author of this report is named "Survivor," which is truly fitting. However, his "quick-wittedness" and "adaptive action" of landing ashore are admirable.</p>
<p>From this Jingsheng steamer tragedy, the lessons learned from "travel" are to be alert, not to rush, not to panic, and to rather let others go first than to hurry. Haste will lead to confusion, and when a sudden change occurs, there will be no time to take action. Like "Survivor" Mr. Someone, being able to see that the situation was not good and quickly abandon his luggage to jump into another sampan, is the reason why he was able to remain calm in the face of danger, adapt to the situation, and be reborn. Therefore, like "taking the world as one's home," the traveler must be careful and alert. Careful and alert are not only conditions that should be possessed on the journey, but also conditions that are endlessly useful in other things in life.</p>
<h3>Yang Caoxian's Old Cloth Single Clothes</h3>
<p>— Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>Mr. Yang Caoxian, an old man of Bai Er, who is good at calligraphy, is over a hundred years old, but he is still hale and hearty. The clothes he wears are mainly loose and comfortable, without seeking beauty; the inner clothes are designed to avoid sweating, adhering to the two sayings of the national doctor, "Sweating cures diseases, sweating causes diseases." Once he sweats, he immediately changes his clothes, so that the sweaty clothes do not stick to his body and invade the pores and blood vessels. The outer clothes are designed to keep out the cold, adhering to the "cloth clothes keep warm" three-character secret. The style is not fashionable, and the material is not fond of silk and satin. No matter spring, summer, autumn, or winter, he must wear an old cloth single coat outside. The waist and cuffs are unusually large, almost like the Dharma clothes worn by Taoists, which has become a habit. Yesterday, at the spring banquet at the Jinmen Hotel in the China Women's Building, he wore this old cloth single coat, running around and receiving guests, very busy. People asked him about the main purpose of wearing cloth clothes. He said that good or bad clothes have nothing to do with me. Although Shanghai only values clothes and not people, I have nothing to ask of people. I sell my calligraphy to support myself. I go my own way. It is still comfortable to wear old cloth single clothes. Now that everything is soaring in price, making a good piece of clothing would cost three or five years of living expenses for a refugee. It is not worth it. It not only loses the lives of others, but also wants to lose my own life. The income from selling my calligraphy has always been used for three purposes: (1) Relieving refugees, (2) Repaying, and (3) To be content with food and clothing, it is already difficult, so how dare I ask for beautiful clothes and pursue the fashion of one person? After the people present studied what he said, they came up with the following comments and prepared to write a horizontal plaque to present to him as a souvenir, roughly saying that cloth clothes are proud of princes and nobles, and are independent of the world. It is called noble, but it is not pretentious, but eccentric. Judging from the principle of common survival of mankind, it does not seem to be appropriate. Great men also advocate frugal and virtuous old cloth single clothes. A group of misers and hoarders are not included in this example and must be clearly distinguished. Poor and humble people wear old cloth clothes because they are forced by the environment. He wrote a word abroad and received 20,000 yuan, which can be called turning stone into gold, as rich as princes and nobles, but he is also so frugal, which is indeed commendable. Today, entertaining guests here is to implement the second item of the three purposes. I hope that he will continue to follow the past methods for the first item, then there is no need to persuade him to make clothes, but to be able to implement his proposition for the third item.</p>
<h3>Idle Talk About Rubber Tires</h3>
<p>— Xiao Lang</p>
<p>Rubber tires, such as those for rickshaws and rickshaws, are one of the auxiliary supplies for transportation. More than ten years ago, those used in the market were completely imported. According to the Jianghai Customs report more than ten years ago, the annual import was about 40 to 50 million yuan, and the leakage was so large that it was shocking. Later, the Ye Zhenming Enpu brothers gathered Zhu Liangfu and other enthusiastic comrades in the industry to establish the Datong Industrial Company to manufacture Sanyuan brand tires for sale to the world. This was the beginning of domestic tires. Subsequently, Dahua Yisheng and others were produced at the right time, but their main business was rubber shoes, etc. Tires were only one of the subsidiary products, which was slightly different from Datong. The raw materials of tires are glue, zinc spring powder, magnesium carbonate, litharge, sulfur, black ink, accelerators, lithopone, canvas, etc. (I will not list them all). Generally speaking, whether a tire is strong and durable, it is necessary to choose good canvas, which is the only necessary condition. Secondly, the mixing of rubber powder and the average pressure should also be noted. Mr. Ye and others have worked hard to research, and after several setbacks, they finally did not lose heart. At present, they have achieved the goal of domestic capital, domestic materials, and domestic manufacturing. As a result, all imported products in the market have disappeared, reducing the number of imports every year. In the midst of advocating domestic products, efforts to produce is to increase the power of resistance, which is indeed an exciting thing.</p>
<p>Currently, there are about 10,000 rickshaws and about 300,000 bicycles in Shanghai. According to a private survey, 60% of them have adopted Sanyuan brand tires. Since the National Government moved west, the highways in the southwest and northwest have advanced by leaps and bounds, and the demand for transportation tools has been very high. The supply of auxiliary products should be exhausted and domestic products should be used. Even the islands of Southeast Asia have inquired about the situation of domestic tires from China, which can reflect that the Chinese people have been awakened in the midst of national difficulties, and everyone is willing to fulfill the natural duty of using domestic products.

<h3>Lofty Necessities of Life in the League of Nations: Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation</h3>
<p>— Tianyan Zhilang</p>
<p>The "League of Nations," judging by its name, is a political group that transcends the governments of various nations. The council convenes four times a year. Geneva, a famous Swiss city known for its tranquility and elegance, suddenly shines brightly on this auspicious day, transforming into a heavily made-up Xi Shi. I will not inquire into the powers and abilities of the council members, nor do I have time to calculate the airplane and first-class car travel and entertainment before and after the meetings. If I were to simply describe the luxurious lifestyle of the council members during the four large and small meetings, it would truly be worthy of being called the unique Supreme Immortal Abode in the world. Regardless of whether a country is wealthy or poor, and regardless of the size of its population, the life of these "lucky star" reincarnated council members is not only something that very few people in the world can experience, but perhaps even fewer people in the world know about in detail. Today, I will unveil the mystery and write a poem about each aspect, to offer to my compatriots who are afraid of spending money and hesitate to step forward. Perhaps it will be like using a painting of a cake to satisfy hunger, bringing temporary spiritual comfort.</p>
<p>First, Ode to Clothing: Pristine white like the Zhongtiao Mountains. The cut is loose, wide on the outside. The sash hangs loosely, as desired. May peace prevail, celebrating promotion. Note: The "League of Nations" is a place where typical diplomatic officials gather, and England is a place that produces typical tailors. Clothing must cross the sea to be obtained from England, demonstrating its beauty. After the European war, many people in Russia wore rags, but the chief representative attending Geneva still wore a completely new set of high-quality attire, changed several times a day. Fortunately, it was a business trip with public expenses, so he did not have to pay out of his own pocket. When diplomatic officials attend formal dinners or evening parties, they naturally change into tailcoats to enhance their dignified appearance. Even if there are storms in the world, they will never reach Geneva. Although Abyssinia is in ashes and Spain is engulfed in flames, the diplomatic officials of those countries, due to their service in the League of Nations, are rewarded for their service. The position of chief representative is valuable, and the frequency with which the chief representative changes clothes is even more valuable. The white collar, white shirt, and white scarf, which are in the "middle" and "straight," are valued for their "white" color, free from any speck of dust. The enjoyment of loosening the sash and leisurely wearing new clothes, and enjoying oneself to the fullest during morning and evening rest, is the ultimate secret for contemporary diplomatic officials to achieve "clear minds" and "lofty sentiments." Confucius only achieved doing as he pleased at the age of seventy, how late it was!</p>
<p>Second, Ode to Food: Fine wine flows like a spring at the immortals' gathering. Rare delicacies are served, entertaining honored guests. Only now do I understand the weight of the plate. Exhaling fragrant breath, all things are renewed in spring.</p>
<p>Note: Geneva is a miniature Paris, with fine wines and delicacies that are treasured throughout the world. The specialties of the major restaurants along the Quai du Mont-Blanc are so numerous and beautiful in color, aroma, and taste that it would take ten years of study to fully explain the origins of their names. Diplomatic terminology is simple, but culinary terminology is very difficult. Even the erudite Gu Hongming was ridiculed by a Western waiter for not recognizing the menu (as reported in the Shen Bao on October 30 of last year). It is easy to eat, but difficult to know. I will now take the menu for a light lunch at the Hotel Beau-Rivage and translate it. Compared to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and his wife eating turkey in Hankou on Christmas 1937, it seems to be several times more enjoyable. The exquisite delicacies and small victories are too numerous to count. "Those who are not insiders cannot fully appreciate their subtleties," resembling the mountain god entertaining the Five Dragons and serving the hundred spirits. After the second main course, these "five large" and "many small" council members, full of "national meals," if there are several people present, will always give short, witty speeches that are neither too serious nor too trivial. As soon as the eloquent speech, perfumed with wine and meat, ends, applause follows. Regardless of the eight festivals or four seasons, there is always the joy of a spring day in the pot. Beautiful is Geneva, deeply understanding the principles of modern diplomacy and preserving peace. A sample lunch menu is listed below.</p>
<p>Third, Ode to Housing: The flowing waves brush against the railing, as clear as the sea. Tall trees pierce the clouds, evoking the sound of autumn. The joy of peace is worth ten thousand gold coins per moment. Red leaves adorn the pavilion, proudly displaying their late-season glory. Note: Swiss travel is well-prepared, always inspiring sighs of admiration, but this is not easily understood by short-term visitors. As for the extravagance of the League of Nations' expenses, if we combine the membership fees of various countries and the expenses of the chief representatives, the cost of an hour of meeting may exceed ten thousand Chinese dollars.</p>
<p>Fourth, Ode to Transportation: Counting the clouds like rafts on the clear lake. The autumn wind calls to the sea as one family. Slowly, the clear shade moves with the star-adorned banners. The sun sets beyond the White Mountain Bridge. Note: The White Mountain Bridge is lined with mansions on both sides, and at noon, the carriages are numerous. The carriages with small national flags of bright colors in front are reserved for the chief representatives. The distance across the bridge cannot be traveled on foot. The dignity is solemn and refreshing, reminiscent of ancient officials.</p>
<h3>A Week of Economical Menus</h3>
<p>— Ms. Huamei</p>
<p>Cauliflower seems to be a vegetable for the nobility, because it often has a place in banquets of all sizes, and it is also often used in Western food. However, recently the price of cauliflower is not very expensive, and you can buy a small one for ten cents. Because the price is not expensive, I want to invite it to participate in this economical menu. For meat dishes, it is very delicious whether it is stir-fried with shrimp or stir-fried with kidney. However, shrimp and kidney are too expensive, so it is more economical to stir-fry it with pork slices or pork cubes, and you can skip the soy sauce. If you add more soup, it can be eaten with rice, which is very simple and elegant. As for vegetarian dishes, you can add vegetarian ten-scenery. If you fry it with bamboo shoots and mushrooms, it can also occupy a seat at a vegetarian banquet.</p>

<h3>Riding the Same Boat</h3>
<p>Editor: Recently, the news about the strike at the ×× Third Cotton Mill is a truly dangerous omen on this isolated island, especially with the recent increase in labor unrest. The crux of the problem, of course, is the impact of rising prices and hoarding. The workers here, suffering from the heavy exploitation of unscrupulous merchants, are not trying to disrupt order, but rather to uphold it, and are therefore making a reasonable request. They are finding it difficult to even support the most basic of necessities—a bowl of congee and a meal. How can workers work after expending their labor and sweat if they don't add fuel (food)?</p>
<p>However, the bosses are too cruel. They once said to the workers: "Unless you starve to death, there are more than a thousand sacks here, ready to throw you all into the river together." Such people are truly selfish and self-serving.</p>
<p>Starting that day (the 11th), the factory re-registered workers, which, in other words, meant dismissing them en masse. Imagine what will happen to these completely dismissed people. If they take desperate measures, wouldn't that exacerbate social unrest? Therefore, I respectfully appeal to all sectors to uphold justice and to urge the capitalists to handle this matter openly and fairly. I believe that at this time and in this place, everyone must cooperate sincerely. Only when national workers have food to eat can they work.</p>
<p>Wishing you well, Spring and Autumn reader Chen Jingsi (no reply needed)</p>
<h3>The Buying and Selling of US Dollar Notes</h3>
<p>— Zhang Zhenshan</p>
<p>I saw advertisements in the newspaper for buying and selling US dollar notes, saying that you only need to pay a little deposit to trade at any time. Today, with the price of US dollar notes rising to 15.5 yuan, it's amazing that such a business has emerged. It really feels like there are too many and too easy opportunities to make money in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Although I know that the reality is not that simple, and I have no intention of making a fortune in US dollar notes, since this type of business is still new in Shanghai, to understand what is really going on, I pretended to be a customer who was determined to buy US dollar notes. I obtained a copy of the regulations and read it once, twice, three times. There were still some parts that were vaguely worded and not very clear. After inquiring in person, the so-called "low commissions and interest rates"... were finally understood.</p>
<p>For example: If you prepare to buy 100 US dollar notes, you only need to pay a deposit of 200 yuan. At the current market price of 15.5 yuan, it would cost 1,550 yuan to buy them, but now you only need to pay 200 yuan. On the surface, it seems very cheap, but in reality? It's not that simple. In addition to the 200 yuan deposit, there is also a commission of one percent and an interest rate of one and a half percent. The calculation method is as follows: Assuming you buy 100 US dollar notes, the equivalent in legal tender, after deducting the 200 yuan deposit, is equal to an overdraft of 1,350 yuan. For this 1,350 yuan, you must pay an interest rate of one and a half percent per yuan, plus a commission of one percent, totaling 33.75 yuan. In reality, it is equivalent to a loan rate of two and a half percent to buy US dollar notes. At the end of the month, if the exchange rate between US dollar notes and legal tender does not change, then your monthly expenditure of 33.75 yuan will be like "a mute eating Coptis chinensis, unable to express the bitterness." Even if the exchange rate rises favorably, it must rise by at least 0.34 yuan per dollar to break even. Based on past experience, although the price of US dollar notes has risen a lot, it has not risen suddenly; it has risen gradually. If you wait month after month, perhaps one day your ideal rise will be realized, but after offsetting the monthly interest expenses, it is not "you" who is making money, but "them." As for the exchange rate of US dollar notes falling? Then they have your deposit as collateral, and when the loss reaches 50%, the disposal rights of these US dollar notes belong to them.</p>
<p>We have a saying that "the eyes are black and the silver is white." The reason why those speculators manipulate the market is to satisfy their desire for "silver." However, if ordinary people abandon legitimate business and want to gamble for unjust wealth, then they will fall into our saying "digging loaches from a cat's mouth," which is extremely difficult! Moreover, the foundation of their speculative business is built on such a fragile opportunity!</p>
<h3>The Buying and Selling of Diplomas</h3>
<p>— (Lun)</p>
<p>I have a classmate who was in the second year of high school last semester. After the winter vacation, he suddenly entered university and became a university student! But he is a student at a private university.</p>
<p>As far as I know: Private universities do not enroll new students without "sufficient education". You must have a high school diploma to be admitted. So when I saw that classmate had entered university, I found it very strange. After inquiring, I learned that he had spent over 100 yuan to buy a diploma from an agency. This kind of leapfrog education does not have good results for students, which goes without saying. However, what is strange is that there are actually schools that "sell diplomas."</p>
<p>Schools are places where students receive education, not places to manufacture "qualifications," and certainly not places to sell "qualifications." Now, there are schools that boldly sell diplomas, so these schools can simply be turned into shops, shops that sell diplomas. Perhaps this is because there are no direct educational institutions to manage them on the isolated island, so those school principals are "blinded by greed" and "do whatever they want." Finally, I hope that the education authorities will know about these diploma-selling schools and give them severe sanctions!</p>
<h3>After the Rain, a Clear Sky</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 21: Managing the Economy, Mixing Fibers, Promoting Machinery, Assisting the Written Word</p>
<p>Wu Junsu asked, "Why must the newspaper printed by that machine be transported to that province? Is it possible that the newspapers printed by each machine are different, so they must be separated by boundaries?" Shao Huihua said, "Not so. This is just for ease of transportation. After the newspaper is printed by the machine, it is directly transported to the packaging room on the upper floor. For example, the newspaper printed by the machine in Zhejiang Province is sent to the packaging room on the upper floor, and this packaging room is dedicated to packing newspapers going to Zhejiang. After packing, the label is attached, and it is immediately sent to the truck by pulley. This truck is parked at the door of the packaging room, and as soon as it is loaded, it is immediately sent to the Shanghai-Zhejiang road. How convenient this is! Otherwise, the order would be chaotic. The newspaper of Zhejiang Province is like this, and so is the newspaper of other provinces. But we also have to distinguish between train newspapers and plane newspapers. Because the trucks transporting the newspapers are all regulated. The trucks carrying train newspapers go directly to the train station. The trucks carrying plane newspapers go directly to the airport. So our newspaper trucks, like the machines, are all clearly marked." Tian Junsu said, "I see. Then you must have many trucks delivering newspapers in the morning?" Shao Huihua said, "Not many! We now have 30 special trucks for transporting newspapers. But recently we still feel it is not enough, so we have ordered ten new ones. The old ones can be replaced and used for other purposes!" Wu Junsu said, "Then what about the newspapers in this city? Of course, they don't need to go to the packaging room." Shao Huihua said, "Ah! The most newspapers are in this city. Look at that long row of machines; they are all printing the city's newspapers. Although they don't need to be packed, they are also transported to the upper floor, which is a distribution room. People who read newspapers want to be the first to see them, so as soon as the newspaper leaves the machine, it must be sent to people to read immediately." Ku Junsu said, "It's a pity that you distribute the newspapers at dawn; otherwise, I would come and see. Those people who deliver newspapers every day must be very crowded in front of your newspaper office." Shao Huihua said, "Not crowded! If all the newspaper deliverers in Shanghai had to come to the newspaper office every day to pick up the newspapers, it would naturally be very crowded. But now the distribution department has set up many distribution stations. Just like our newspaper office, there are twelve distribution stations in Shanghai. As soon as the newspaper is published, it is transported to various distribution stations by truck. Such as the west district in the west district, the east district in the east district, the south city in the south city, the north city in the north city, and the city's newspaper delivery network each have their own region. Newspaper deliverers all go to various distribution stations to wait. If you want to see, go to that distribution station to see. Rows of bicycles are all numbered, and when they depart, it is quite a sight." (251)</p>
