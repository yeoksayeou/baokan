<p>社評</p>
<h3>南近聲中之日本內部情況</h3>
<p>最近的日本，在外交方面雖事實上既陷窮途，而體察他一般的動態，對外依然企圖持續其攻勢：無論有關軍事的種種部署，或不計成敗的外交嘗試，無不積極從事，尤以南進一途表示其爲所側重的趨嚮：本報已連日予以檢討。在他踏進這樣一個新的重大冒險之前，其內部情况是否有所改進，種種配置是否均屆完成。那是重大問題。前此近漸曾經表示：「在最近的將來，就有一種決定國家百年運命新危機到來」，可見他對於目前所處境地，不只早有預感，而且是相當警戒着的。但這裏的問題不在有無認識，而在於有無對策；際此元老新喪，再沒有人在背後對於日本國運隱爲調皮和指導，一切都只有看近衛與其僚屬的本領歷。數日本歷史，也許要算目前情况最爲艱難。當明治維新以前；外有不平等條約的桎梏，內有跋扈割據的慕府，也約略與目前差堪彷彿，但卻是代表着新生與衰頹的兩個不同時代。尤其是彼時種種難題大多來自外部，此際一切困窘則泰牛由於自身；如其不逞野心，不肆黷武，不視鄰邦如屬領，以列强爲可欺，則此際國際閒當不致阻礙日本的正常發展。日人之中，並非全不認識此義，但一則懾於軍部的威勢，再則阻於國際局勢的逆流，只能微弱的潛伏着；現在代表着日本自由主義與民治憲政的西園寺復告殂落，預料此一見解，如非內外情勢有特殊變動，一時殆無抬頭可能。而以近衛爲首的日本當局一派，在外觀看來雖似與急進右翼份子無殊，實則是介於極端者流與保守陣營的中間派。他一方以新政體制相號召，却對於所謂既成勢力仍在迷戀；其內心固幻想能予軍部以統馭，在行動上又一切舉措皆與軍部相共鳴，以是急進者抨擊其不激底，保守陣營則反對其革新，甚至連共產主義的嫌疑都有人加諸近衛新政之身，致需一再予以聲辯，縱觀國民新聞邇來言論，殆無往而不與近衛松岡爲難，右翼軍人與所謂日本國粹主義派系反對近衛尤烈；而產業界與資本家近來對於近衛新政，亦復採取不合作態度。今秋近衛上台之初，本以消除各方相蝕相尅爲號召，現在統一之效未見，近衛自已一派反亦形成衆矢之的；則即使他具有明智的認識和重大的抱負，在這樣一個嚴重關頭，亦正難設想其能如何作有效的運用，何况在根本上他與日本盲目急進份子也只是程度上的差別。</p>
<p>自從近衛的新政體制運動蛻化而爲大政翼贊運動而後，其重要性與號召力均已大形冲淡，近衛自己既缺乏必要的氣魄，又沒有羣衆的基礎，結果其所號召的運動只能建立在各種既成勢力的均衡之上，硬要使自由主義者與極權主義以至極右傾的日本國粹主義者共同擔負指導中樞。在近衛有馬等人的見解，是要「從既成勢力的統合整備使其經歷淘汰過程，俾適合舉國動員的要求一；然而這種過程當非一蹴可及的事，一定要經過悠久時間與適當調度纔能發生效果，且說不定中途會因「相蝕相尅而釀成新的糾紛。但是近衛卻把他的理想寄託於這樣一個龐雜的集合體上面，並且期望其發揮支持迫在眉睫的對外冒險企圖的任務，這眞是一個玄妙的理想！</p>
<p>南進目標固在攫取新的市塲與資源，但事實上既非唾手可得，則在其運用過程中，必須更付出重大的代價，並且對於英美的經濟壓力也勢須別覓出路以相抵償。爲了這一需要，日當局之於經濟力面，確也下了絕大苦心去籌劃。遠自今春，日方即採取分散通商政策，謀在南洋中南美等地覓取市塲以代替前此之「英美依存」；三國同盟締結後，復高唱對德義以至蘇聯的經濟提携；更於本月二日通過中日「滿」十年經濟建設計劃，以加緊榨取亞洲大陸的資源。此外包括在近衛新政體制中的國民經濟再編成運動則着手於日本產業的全盤統制，從十月間開始了最爲困難的中小企業改組。凡此一切，都是爲了打破當前經濟難關，以支持其大規模的軍事需要，也就是爲了遂行所謂高度國防經濟的建立。但這些辦法，不是收穫微弱，無裨全局，就是運用奇緩，難期速效。假如南進而出於實際行動，則癃大戰費與物資的消耗，必立即形成嚴重難題。近衛之於經濟方面，顯亦與其在政治方面同樣的沒有有效的出路。</p>
<p>南進而能迅速收效，自亦足以相當消弭日本內部的各種困難，但現在的問題却是除卻越南一部分而外，日本的企圖必然遭遇重大的阻碍，而越南一部顯亦不足饜足日方的欲求。拋開軍事條件不談，單就日本內部經濟政治而言；可斷言近衛的努力並未能使日帝國整個機構適於大規模的冒險行動。</p>

<h3>保加利亞　拒絕加盟　軸心國大為失望</h3>

<h3>歐戰業談廿四　倫敦人的地下生活</h3>
<p>政府本來不准居民在地卜車站躱避空襲，可是公共防空室旣不够支配，而且老百姓究經以生命爲重，也就顧不得一切，只可暫且「方便」了。倫敦東區的貧苦階級他們視地下車站爲唯一樂園。這種車站築於人地一百五十尺深的地方，可謂安全已極。一到晚問，或空　警報發作時，男女老少一一向那裏去了。在那裹，他們就睡在月合上，梯級上，或自動扶梯上。所有畢卡特萊，利塞使脫，霍爾旁，考文花園，及英倫銀行各站，每晚總有十二萬人席地而臥。</p>
<p>一到夜間，地下車站的月台上，擠得水洩不通，大家倒頭便睡，有的備了毯子枕頭之類，有的和衣斜着身子靠在濕冷無溫的墻壁上，也就呼呼入睡了。道地一些的，還帶着熱水瓶，裏面裝了點心溫水，紅茶，咖啡，以便淸早醒來，漱漱口，提提神，就一直上工廠去工作。地下車站「佳座」無多，只好捷足者先得，所以天還沒有黑，已經有許多男女，跑入車站，把毯子之類，鋪在月台上，實行其早睡的良好習慣。至於後來者無隙可乘，只得揀了扶梯的階級，權宿一宵。最討厭的，往往車子開來，輾輾之聲，摧破沉寂，弄得大家難以交睫。</p>
<p>往地下車站中趨避空襲者，他們除了倉猝之間，不及携帶什物者外，許多人還是携箱提籠，凡是可以帶走的東西，和切身物件，多半拿了一起走。所以在紛亂的情形中，又好像旅客們趕上火車的樣子。所不同者，上火車用不着帶被褥枕頭椅子布床之類。而在地下車站的月台上，則這些東西竟是觸目皆是。還有些好整以暇者，帶着查蕉，啤酒之類，預備大嚼。大家擠在地下車站，當然及不到大旅館中的地下室遠甚。所幸裏面的通風設備還不算壞，空氣還不至於十二分的惡濁。不過冷熱水全無，大小便設備十分缺乏，厠所每站只有兩處，而且原來並不爲供給度夜的客人而設，自然諸多不方便了。這種情形也不是地下車站單獨如此，卽政府所築的公共防空室，在計劃築造之初，祇不過供給居民暫時躱避之用，却沒有想到德機連續轟炸，日以繼夜，亘二月而不歇</p>
<p>在地下車站避難者，多半爲中下階級，他們多半在工廠中做事，平時住在二三層樓中閒，並非無家可歸者流。凡是房屋被毀，隨身財產一無所有者，政府另有收容所招待，倒也不勞往車站中躱避了。比了地下車站還要差的，卽係靠近碼頭的堆棧倉庫，這種大棧房，係鋼骨水泥所造，　固異常，較之普通人所住的小屋子，當然要結實多多。每當空襲警報發作時，裹面總是滿坑滿谷，旣沒有通風設備，又無罅隙，窗門閉得緊緊，許多人擁擠在裏面，熱而目悶，眞是這裏面份子複雜，比較地F車站還要利害。地上橫七豎八，諸色人等皆全，有哺乳的母親，嬰孩，黑皮膚的印度人，纔從航海登陸的咖啡色東印度人，白種人碼頭員役，娼妓，擴悍的頭碼工人以及倫敦東區貧民等，他們在地面上總可以我到躲避之所，然而誰還放心呢？因之，無論什麼人，可能的話，還是拚命的要朝地下鑽。</p>
<p>倫敦各大商行，各大百貨商店的底層，也是絕妙的防空室。像里勒街的狄金士瓊斯公司就是其中的俊俊者。凡是比較貧苦的人都可以往這裹躱避空襲。裏邊有良好的通風設備，洗盥厠所俱全。還有一所小酒排間，化二便士就好吃茶一杯，糕餅每塊四便士。十時半以後　燈，一早大家就醒來離去。每天下午四時，公司門外已有許多人等待着進去，但是除了有空襲警報，非得七時不開門。這種地方比k小足，比下有餘，倒也是不可多得的普通防空室。</p>
<p>倫敦居民，宿於上述地F車站，倉庫及各機關地下室的，差不多有三份之一。其餘三分之一住於私人防空室中，還有三分之一則仍是睡在各人自己的床上。每夜睡不到四小時的大約要佔倫敦全人口百分之四十。男人比女子睡得熟，小孩子又比男女大人睡得好。有小孩千的父母熟睡時間頂少。在大規模防空室中，最可怕的是傳染病的發生，因爲人口衆多，管理不易，政府方面正在竭力設法，裝置各種衛生設備。</p>
<p>所謂「恩特生」式防空室者，乃由內政部設計，專供私人或家庭之用，凡財力能勝任，而屋後園旁叉有空地者，大都造上一個。也有許多是由政府出錢　造，以供平　使用。裹面用鐵架支撑，入口高出地面，向下挖深，可容數人；頂作半圓下瀉形，上面堆些沙袋泥土，甚至還有種上些瓜果蔬菜的。這種小規模防空室內設備，有簡單有複雜，視主人的興緻而異。有人把屋子裹的電綫通到防空室中，晚間可以伏案讀書，光綫很亮。到了早晨父可煮些茶水，吃了上寫字閒去。興緻好的人還在屋角裏放個書架子，四面掛些照片圖畫之類，爲調稍剩調劑，裏面的單調空氣。至於裏面而置有無綫電收音機的也不在少數。</p>
<p>德空軍開始空襲英倫之時，有小孩的人家都把孩子們放在小床裏睡，及至聞得空襲警報，纔把他們搬到防空室內。空襲警報解除後，又遷回原處。後來因爲空襲次數太多，常常搬動太麻煩，索性把小床安放在防空室中。夜間便在防空室中作晚禱。無論有沒有空襲來臨，却已養成一種睡在防空室中的習慣了。（未完）</p>

<h3>两租界當局核准　電話增收附加稅　同時準將通話次數減少　增費甚高市民殊難負擔</h3>
<p>上海電話公司、藉口裝置新機、約一萬六千戶、因機器成本高昂、向工部局提出加價之陳請、但因其加價辦法、層疊施行、其程度遠過各項公共事業之紀錄、以致引起全市居民强烈反對、輿論譁然、一致要求常局重加覆議、予以减低、全市各界正佇候當局有以俯允輿情、詎昨據確息、工部局與法公董局對於電話加價、業已批准、該公司並決定於十二月七日起、在兩租界內開始實行、其辦法據工部局情報處所發表之消息如次、</p>
<p>增加費用減少次數</p>
<p>工部局頃核准上海電話公司修改電話收費表並徵收暫行附加費辦法、准自十一月七日起實行、其收費辦法如下、（一）住宅電話、每月基本免費通話次數、由一百次减至六十五次、營業電話由一百五十次减至一百次、超出上項通話次數、每次通話費由三分增至七分、現行基本電話月費照舊、（二）本埠電話費、一律加徵附加費百分之三十、（卽基本電話月費及已增加之額外通話費、一律徵收附加費百分之三十、（三）裝置費及遷機費、增加白分之一百至百分之一百五十、（四）新用戶所付押櫃、應等於基本月費兩年之數、但話機留用滿兩年者上項押櫃、得全部返還、不滿兩年者、得按成返還、</p>
<p>需要殷繁達於極點</p>
<p>據孩公司聲稱年以還、市民對於電話之需求、可稱殷繁已極、應付爲難、上年請求新裝者凡一五四〇七起、今明兩年、每年平均估計、可得二〇、六〇〇起、回憶自一九三二年至一九三八年爲止、每年平均請求新裝者、不滿三七〇　起、此種發達情形、是否屬於暫時的或永久的、實爲疑問、該公司目前仍照一九三穴年間經核准之收費表收費、衡諸其他公用事業之收費情形以及各項物價、則電話收費、較爲低廉重以目前本埠各業、非常發展、人口過剩、雖非永久性質、然而電話需求、因此乃轉呈激增之勢、</p>
<p>添置機器成本提高</p>
<p>該公司在若干時期、能利用一九三七年下半年所拆除之話機、並以留存之配備、應付外界需要、其時外滙情形、遠比目前爲佳、近來則因電話需要較殷、各項機件、勢須添置、於是成本亦隨之提增、尤以機件之必須購自外洋者爲最、</p>
<p>公司所持加價理由</p>
<p>基本通話次數之所以核减以及超出次數之所以加價者、一方面在謀通話次數之减少、一方面在增淮通話之速率、並使公司方面得以提早將大批額外話機接通於現有接綫機上、裝置費與遷機費之所以增加者、一部份用以抵銷工資與物料費用增出之數、至於押櫃之所以提高者、使公司與用戶方面、得一相當保證、以圖抵制一般臨時性質之新用戶、</p>
<p>收入增加百分七十</p>
<p>該公司按照現行收費者之牧入、不特對於投資方面、不能產生相當利潤、抑且不足抵補每年應提之折舊數目、職是之故、該公司請求在上項加費辦法以外、復加徵附加費一項、俾公司此後全部收入、得以應付各項開支（包括機器折舊在內、）同時其投資方面、可以產生經營業章程所允許之利潤、此外其折舊等等項下虧空之數、亦得一相當之補償、按照修正收費表估計公司收入、可增百分之七十、希望增收以後、得有餘款、從事於設備之擴充、良以公司在現狀之下、實　法顧計及此也、</p>
<p>局方討論予以核准</p>
<p>本案經工部局加以縝密之討論、歷時頗久、結果經核准如上、並經法租界公董局函復同意、準自十二月七日起實行、但附加費一項、當於施行十二個月以後、隨時重行考量之、</p>
<p>未待討論提前公布</p>
<p>又據平明社記者探悉上項加價四原則、雖迭經提出已往數次董事會中核准者、但工部局此次於接獲法公董局復函之後、未候通知昨日下午四時之董事會議、竟於昨午提前宜佈、殊使熟悉工部局情形者感覺詫異、蓋工部局華董及日籍董事、對於電話加價過鉅、聞將準備於昨日下午之董事會議中提出加以討論也、</p>
<p>通盤計算增費極鉅</p>
<p>就工部局所發表之加價原則而言、其所加費用、甚爲鉅大、現捨裝置·遷移，押櫃等費用、而單以通話費計算、自下月七日起、電話通話費須如下表價目收費、（一）住宅電話、原來月費爲六元五角、現加百分之三十、爲八元四角五分、基本通話次數、由一百次减爲六十五次、每次爲一角三分、（二）營業電話、由原定月費十元、增爲十三元、基本次數由一百五十次、減爲一百次、每次亦爲一角三分、（三）超基本次數以外通話費、除每次兩三分增爲七分外、尚須再加附加費百分之三十、每次增爲九分一厘、電話加價竟如此鉅大、實使所有一般用戶不勝其負擔也、</p>
<h3>大生輪　美日昨會進行會商</h3>
<p>關於美船大生輪、於本月初在定海洋面被日海軍扣留、迄未釋放之問題、聞美日雙方領館＾員、昨日下午曾一度會商、以便成立一種協定、據美領館人員稱、關於大生輪被扣事之第二次抗議、至少在雙方談話之前、將不致提出、按美方第一次所提之抗議、已接得日方答覆、但此項答覆之內容、美方官員認爲太空泛而不能令人滿意、查大生輪係華泰馬達輪船公司所有、於十一月一日在離滬到半日之航程時、被一日海軍巡洋艦所阻、二日後、被帶至定海、迄今仍在該處、船上旅客初不准登岸、直至十一月十一日、始由一日輪將旅客載運來滬、據聞大生輪上之旅客三十七人及船員二十人、當瞥見日艦時、狀甚恐慌、當時並將一切紙張與文件、均投諸海中、錢財則藏在船上秘密之處、</p>
<h3>傳滯越華貨　將被沒收充公　越督傷關提貨準備拍賣　貨主群情惶惑電部交涉</h3>

<p>運輸公司卸去責任</p>
<p>中國通運公司海防公司通吿云、前接受各商客委託轉口存越未運之貨物、本已請得出口許可證、辦妥手續、租定船隻、準備卽日裝運離防、茲因越南政府忽將一切經越轉口貨物、禁止出口、遂致以往努力徒勞無功、敝公司時間經濟、損失至鉅、茲固不論、憔是對於客商所存貨物、心餘力絀、嗣後倘有任何事故、實難繼續負責、務請各客商設法迅速提貨、以免損失、</p>
<p>貨主紛紛派員赴越</p>
<p>川滇黔聯運貨物、以前　由滬運越之海防及西貢、再轉滇越鐵路轉昆明、自滇越交通因日軍在越登陸中斷後、滯越海防西貢處貨物爲數頗鉅、尤以川滇各帮爲最多、貨物中以棉紗疋頭爲大宗、今各貨主除請政府向越交涉外、頃已各自派員赴海防西貢等地、設法交涉提貨、或銷於當地、或退回香港、但是項交涉是否順利、尙難預料、</p>

<h3>凱旋路等處　又遭搜抄　形勢緊張居民恐慌　傳有工人一名被捕</h3>
<p>滬西越界築路一帶、租界內居民、現均視爲畏途、蓋以該處時有意外風波之故、昨日上午十時三十分許、愚園路姚家閣一帶、突又有大隊日軍百餘人、及所謂「市警」數十名、分乘日軍軍用卡車四輛、開抵愚園路後、分批將白利南路。凱旋路、惇信路。一帶、四面包圍、嚴密搜查住戶及行人、情勢頗爲緊張、該處居民、鑒於愚園路六〇八弄等以往所遭封鎖情形、頓起恐慌幸至午已行撒去、傳有一身穿藍布短衫褲之工人被捕帶去、至日軍搜查原因、無從探悉、顧當局准各業漲價、亦顧念平民生計乎、</p>
<p>建議取締</p>
<p>大中社記者探悉、近日米市場情形更趨惡劣，乃由於謠請又起、雖國洋米不斷來滬、本埠存底日見增厚、而非特大囤戶把持現貨、風紋不動、卽小囤戶亦看風使舵、交易等於以往之交易所、買空賣空之氣息、充滿全塲、以致市價緊俏、市塲管理委員會亦無法予以壓低、惟有澈底管理與實施公賣、政府雖無法行使其職權、但工部局在此非常時期、似應出而負責、原定對於懲罰米商辦法、尤嫌輕縱、至現在平價最重要一點爲次號米應立卽抑價、否則平民何以爲生、</p>
<h3>切面今日漲價　洋米採辦路徑佈置妥洽　萬不得已時向仰光訂購</h3>

<p>米價前途</p>
<p>究諸米業騰漲癥結、不外下列數點、（一）國米產量雖　、惟來源仍不倍往昔、易被投機米商藉口、（二）國際局勢動盪不定、各產米區域情勢緊張、爰人心向上、囤貨不肯輕易脫手、以致買賣不克平衡、奇貨可居、乃致市價頻頻喊高、（三）有關常局不　言出法隨、坐失良機、徒託空言、威信已失、故欲穩定滬市整個民食、端須山有關當局督率指示方針、乘機訂購大宗國洋米糧、遣派專輪設法運滬儲藏、以裕民食存底、並將該項食米、按時抑價供應市塲、以安人心、</p>

<p>證券暗盤昨市、因國外市塲中國公債驟漲、行市初疲後堅、無如浮多傾吐、極爲擁擠、致市價無法抬頭、丙種穿出四元後、復又打破、趨勢已不若前之强硬、市塲人心、稍覺懈怠、前途或將略爲盤旋後、再隨國內外形勢爲轉變、昨日交易較爲淸淡、鴻大信孚仍有買進、聯益敦餘恒孚上午均有需要、長康潤利看開小價、震大久豐及昌記均有賣出、行市竟愈賣愈高，丙種穿出六十四元、午後鴻大信孚續有買進、怡泰生大樂茂均有收進、市價初開堅挺、恒孚聯和轉賣、大華潤德及同順斬多、浮多亦紛紛出籠、市價又打破四元、市價結果、仍稍稍回好一二角、九六已少成交、總數共計約一百八九十　元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票昨交易、成交中一信託股一百股價爲十四元衆　公所股市、人心稍佳、但仍暗淡非凡、價格無甚變更、成交亦極消淡、</p>
<p>倫勢二十六日（週二）電、今日中國外債及遠東英商各公司股票掛牌行市　債　呈起色、善　借款「英發」、又好一鎊、價爲二十四鎊久未開出之中法美金五厘公債、亦　掛三十五鎊至四十鎊、其餘平定、英股亦　榮辱、</p>
<h3>絲茶　絲經來貨甚少</h3>
<p>最近絲茶來貨甚鮮、尤　乾經爲甚、故本市買賣因之淸淡、洋行方面、吃價難高、昨日達昌怡和等洋行、略有交易、計輯里絲正副牌售開三、四〇〇元、特上大上海國花等三、八〇〇元、白廠、〇·二二·七十八分四、六五〇元、</p>
<p>用戶白廠經去路無多、故較洋行價格約低一千元之鉅、至於蘇·杭·錫內地一帶、售價僅在二千七八百元左右、因遭統制、故未能來滬、</p>
<h3>紗花　傳廣幫專賣　紗市回松</h3>
<p>紗市又呈廻旋局面、此因實際生意較爲减色、以致人心疲弱、空頭活動、市狀帶軟、但多頭中堅份子依然無動靜、惟有一部附和者、已經放棄、本日盛傳沙漁涌口岸錢有障碍、一時人氣虛怯而下降、查查港幫仍辦棉紗近百件、不過和覺淸淡、以上謠風、恐難證實也、昨日有棉紗五件運厦門、二百五十五件運香港、</p>
<p>雙馬晨開人氣尙紫、因上日午後匯票轉縮、金子幫及投機者都來收進、首盤價爲一千二百二十二元、此盤一開、搶進者頗旺、直仆至一千二百二十八元、一霎間塲內謠霄驟起、且賣者紛紜、謂廣幫賣出期貨雙馬有四五百包、心思看鬆、於是空　大爲活動、市盤急轉直下至一千一白〇五元、繼以獲利扒空、又復升至一千二百十六元、收盤價爲一千二百十元、查半日閒成交統計六千〇五十二包、行情二十支雙馬跌四元、茲將各幫口買去夕額量、分列如下、</p>
<h3>棉市無大變化</h3>
<p>現　棉交易、稍形開展、然行市無大變化、而乏伸縮也、同業心思和善、但廠胃不開、所以趨勢依然趦趄小前、火機草包價爲二百零一元、平果爾價一百六十八元、巴西棉價爲二百八十元、昨有棉花二百二十件運港、</p>
<p>外　棉市價、紐約棉市、堅定而活躍、續後則又因棉區多雨、及一部份之空頭抵補、結果收盤價格、較之上日漲二三磅音、印度則降一羅比餘、</p>
<p>滬　埠外棉交易、日來始終靜寂異常、各方咸抱觀望態度、同業之購意却殊爲淡薄、故全日未聞有交易也、</p>
<h3>疋頭　廠單貸紛紛轉棧</h3>
<p>廠布　昨市趨勢堅穩、交易頻繫、　貨價穩定、染廠及客幫吸胃益濃、廠棧單貨爲避免增加出廠統稅計、紛紛轉儲倉庫棧、各棧均吿滿額、售盤大致平平、惟綸昌怡和等廠缺檔谷貨、續漲每疋二角半至五角、本街成交各貨八百餘件、粤港幫辦色布漂布府綢粗細布等四百餘件、浙閩幫辦色斜漂布終呢府綢等一百賒件、北路烟台幫辦粗布等一百餘件、昨有疋頭二百八十三件運港、四十件運厦門、今日尙有二百件運烟台、</p>
<p>東布　形勢續軟、白貨細布細斜父跌每疋一二角、十二磅　頭細布收盤三十五元一角半、四君子嗶嘰一元零七分半、</p>
<h3>雜糧　黃豆銷路　不過爾爾</h3>
<p>邇　來黃豆市面疲弱、一因傳大連開禁、二則銷塲不過爾爾、致人氣頹唐、市價步　、昨日趨勢仍疲、惟在後市、因香港帮續有採選、又値油價無甚變動、故一度趨緊、但大局終無進展、計開天津金元千許包、價爲三十五元五角、後開三十五元七角、靑島黃豆一百餘包、三十四元、九江遲豆三百五十包、三十五元五角、</p>
<p>雜糧昨日進出、頗爲旺盛、進口有由天津運來•子二百包、出口則有豆子二百九十五包運厦門、五百四十八包運香港、豆餅四千七百四十塊運香港、三千三百五十七塊運厦門、生油一千四百二十二聽運厦門、芝蔴五百七十五包運香港、</p>
<h3>糖市　糖價微有上落</h3>
<p>昨糖市趨勢尙平、上落甚微、公會劃盤，現貨二四粗白本棧七十二元六角、小三角、外棧七十二元至七十一元九角、升一二角、荷棉白BW嘜仍七十一元、荷赤現貨五十五元七角、小二角、太古車白B嘜十二月五日打　單七十五元三角、東棧七十四元八角、升二角、DY嘜中棧六十八元三角、HX嘜六十八元一角、均升一角、</p>
<p>茲將上週末止荷糖存底調查</p>
<h3>煤炭　大批越煤到後　鴻基屑反告漲價</h3>
<p>越煤大批到滬、上星期日法輪曲江號、由海防運來煤斤八千五百噸、昨日下午三時許抵滬之暹羅號、亦山海防裝來煤斤八千噸、現泊九十號浮筒起卸過駁、</p>
<p>鴻基白煤屑、自日昨法給安那第輪抵埠、卽有新貨七千噸裝到、但因此次水脚勗貴、及保險費提高、成本自然增大、白煤屑同業行拆、每噸喊一百五十五元、較前盤加上二十一元之多、以是各煤球廠亦水漲船高、廠盤暫加十二元、但較新屑成本、尙感不敷、故該業甚望水脚回落、煤價自不减自低云、</p>
<h3>五金　會司鐵步高　實銷反感</h3>
<p>會司鐵交易、因其價格高昂、反見呆滯、蓋津烟靑等北幫客商去路、時斷時續、且無大量運往、銷胃已非昔比、而本街製罐廠熱水瓶廠印刷廠香烟公司以及餅乾廠等、雖時有點綴、惟爲數亦不大、查前昨成交者、僅三四百箱、市象並不如何熱鬧、標準行盤、反因海外定價高昂、而見步升、昨老鋼廠售一百八十元、新鋼廠一百七十元、</p>
<h3>南北貨　雜路紅棗續鬆</h3>
<p>雜路紅棗、近市依然不振、反見續鬆、昨府紅棗開三十四元、長紅棗二十五元、均小二元、成交百餘包、行盤府紅棗售三十六元、長紅棗二七元、查產價雖平、劃中亦難保本云、</p>
<h3>同安圓肉　首批即遭虧耗</h3>
<p>同安生晒圓肉、首批僅到八箱因値海南貨聞有多數可到行盤步跌三四十元、未能得價、故此次每擔須虧數十元云、</p>
<h3>藥材　大黃步升　二三十元</h3>
<p>大黃產於四川、爲退熱利便之品、近到至稀、故市價逐步見升、查本月上旬曾漲二十元、邇來續漲二三十元、集盤已近九百元云、</p>
<h3>海味　新海蜒售開</h3>
<p>海蜓新貨、自今秋出水以來、未聞有到、始於最近由威海運來中條貨十餘箱、身骨至佳隨卽售開成價爲一百五十元、</p>
<h3>紙張　土紙價貴</h3>
<p>浙東土紙運滬者、以草紙及屛紙爲大宗、草紙產於富陽·桐廬·衢州·及寗紹一帶、屛紙則產於蕭山·上虞·諸暨·新倉一帶，用途是大家都知道的、屛紙的用途、是穌·皖·魯·冀晋各人土用以代替其箔楚燒、但亦可用作習字簿、故銷路亦極旺、「已一五」浙海封鎖以前、這兩種土紙　甬運滬的、數量極鉅、故售價較之去年下半年度、所漲尙微、草紙每捆售國幣二元八角至三元五角、衛生草紙細質每大捆（註）則爲六元二角至七元五角、屛紙每件自十二元五角至十四元五角、惟目浙海封鎖之後、上海到貨幾絕跡、但因銷路仍極旺盛、故市上存貨逐漸吿罄加夕紙商居奇囤積、欲從市上整批購得以轉運外埠者、勢已不可能了、因此、紙價逐步飛漲、截至目前爲止、粗質草紙每捆售價已在八元五角至－元零五角之間、細質衛生草紙售價更漲至每－捆二十四元至二十六元、竟較封鎖前漲上一倍至二倍有牛、屛紙售價爲每件二十八元至三十二元但較好貨質之「蕭山汪笑記屛尖」、及「上虞屛」等、市上幾已絕跡、紙商大都以劣質之「本山八「尖」應市耳、（註衛生草紙一大捆、可抵粗質草紙三小捆之張數　（雁）</p>

<h3>路有凍死骨</h3>
<p>— 張鴻</p>
<p>朋友！目莫掩鼻。吾擔保，決不會有一絲臭味。</p>
<p>爲什麼還不放開？不相信嗎？哪，我來告訴您。</p>
<p>就在昨天的晚上，僅僅祇有九個鐘點以前，不是很短嗎？您老兄打二十圈麻將的工夫。他應該是說牠，還有血，還有氣，心還在跳着呢。再不相信，進去問烟級店的夥計，他們都看見。</p>
<p>該記得昨晚的北風很紧吧，從暖氣装置的舞塲裏走出來鑽進汽車時，您大概打過一個寒噤。</p>
<p>就在這醬園的門口，是啊！是那石界的地方，猜得一點也不錯。他就蹲在那裏。</p>
<p>似乎眼睛已經蒙了翳，遠遠望去像　一層白膜。深黃的鼻涕，垂到了口邊，幾乎已經流過了嘴唇；若不是還在顫抖，誰又敢說這灶一個活人？</p>
<p>當然！換了您，早就徧過　了顛，閉上了眼，把香噴噴的手帕鼻上一掩，完了！可是，您總還沒有忘記老朋友這改不掉的好奇癖性吧！完全忘記了出來還有一點什麼事，就憑着</p>
<p>我靜靜地看，他静靜地抖，差不参十分鐘。</p>
<p>大概在寒冷之餘，忽然想到飢餓吧！他伸出如此怕人的一隻手，這隻手連我也有些不敢置信：您？別說看過，恐怕想也沒有想到過呢。啊！您把他和女人們的細腰比，好！比得妙！可是，朋友，您肯把大衣袋裏的手伸出和他摟一摟嗎</p>
<p>對啦；講下去吧！左摸右摸也摸到了一點洋鐵罐，又在罐裏摸到了一雙筷。這神情當然沒有像您們紳士吃大菜般地那麼從容；可是，這一刹那，他得到食物的喜悅也不是您們所能享受到的。</p>
<p>這喜悅維持得并不長久，失去了知覺的眼睛，像女人細腰一般的手，罐裏？幾乎是沒有什麼東西了，一只筷在罐裏，一只筷在罐外，盡是想撈，這後果，不用我講。在一個比較劇烈的抖動之下，鐵罐滾到了人行道的邊沿。這也許是他終身僅有的一次和他唯一的生命般的鐵罐分離。</p>
<p>連他自已也可以明白，今天晚上恐怕是不能過了。我想或者可以等着看他像鐵罐一般滾倒，可是，失敗了！一直等到八點半，依然是蹲在那裏抖。失望地，我不得不放棄好奇了。</p>
<p>到底什麼時候他放棄他的人生了？這却難說，對啊！又有誰會替他算時辰刻訃告呢？總之，至多也不過九小時，決不會臭，我擔保。現在想可以放下您的手帕了吧。</p>
<p>霍桑探案</p>
<h3>舞后的歸宿</h3>
<p>— 程小青著</p>
<p>第十二章　　報告和解釋</p>
<p>松泉開始說道：「我和荷生在上半天奉了倪探長的命令，派到青蒲路去。我們守了五個多鐘頭，那一十七號裏並沒有動靜，也沒有什麼人進出。直到下半天三點鐘光景，才見那老頭兒出來，我就跟着他去。荷生仍留在那邊。</p>
<p>「那老頭兒僱了一輛黄包車，一直到寶興路一家源昌珠寶鋪門前停下，一直走進去。我在門外等了好久——差不多近半個鐘頭。這時候珠實鋪門前有兩個人徘徊着，一個穿一件灰色薄昵的夾袍，另一個穿一身瞥脚的西装。我還不知道這兩個人有什麽目的。過了一回，那老頭兒從珠寶店裏出來了。那門外兩個人假意走開。老頭兒不再坐車子，步行着向東。他好像要找尋什麽所在，曾向路上的行人問詢過幾次。我跟在老人後面回頭瞧瞧，見那兩個可疑的人仍遠遠地跟在後面。我雖懷疑這两個人的行動，但又不便干涉他們。</p>
<p>「老人走到相近寶興路口，忽閃進一條小弄裏去。我急忙趕緊一步，恰見他正拿出一佃白色的小包，向弄堂口的垃圾箱裏丟進去。我急忙避開，讓那老人重新從小弄中囘出來。我等他出弄以後，也連忙閃進弄裏去，從垃圾箱中拿起那個小包，打開來一瞧，那是一把小刀，用一塊白手巾包着。」</p>
<p>桑忽仰起了身子，舉一舉右手。「金壽兄，道把刀已交給你了罷？能不能讓我瞧一瞧？」</p>
<p>倪金壽應道「是的，我剛才正要告訴你松泉帶回來的一把刀，可以印合李芝範行兇的理想。不過我當時還有些莫名其妙。」他說着　開了他面前的抽屉，拿出那個白巾小包來授給霍桑。</p>
<p>霍桑把白巾展了開來，裏面顯出一把廉價的尖頭水菓刀。我瞧見那刀的刀鋒約有四五吋長，刀柄是木質的，有些兒橢圓形。這刀祇須化上數角的代價，随處可以購得。我瞧瞧那刀锋，不見什麼血跡，但那塊包裹的白手巾上，却染了不少血漬，並且這白巾上還有不少污泥。　　（一七九）</p>
<h3>淚</h3>
<p>— 品品</p>
<p>從前曾讀過一個故事，說有個公主，雙目已盲，舆她從小訂婚的一個王子發现這缺點，請一個術士來替她醫治，術士叫王子在她面前說最親愛的話公主聽了心酸，流淚汨汨，雙目複明了。淚是寶貴的，牠會带來幸福，在長時間的痛熱　。</p>
<p>你的家室毀了，你的財產失了，你應該流淚；但是要記住：誰給你　S壞與损失？你將咬牙　　，燃起一股怒火，向他索取償還．獨自含怨，只是坐待，要不得的呀！不是女兒之哭，而是英雄之淚，懂了嗎！</p>
<p>我們的淚不是白流的，我們要讓淚喚起我們的仇怒，以鐵翼般的力量爭回我們的光榮舆幸福，倘若你有淚，現在流吧，勇敢而想爭鬥的人們！</p>
<p>淚還有一個價值：牠是　醒的符號。</p>
<p>親愛的朋友，你因痛苦而流過淚嗎？假使流過了，天會賜福給你，你不久便能獲得快樂。</p>
<p>整天流淚，當然是戕害，而且是可笑的。流淚的時候，　不要一面嘆息只有怯懦的人才嘆息。那麼怎樣呢？在麼該流淚的時候流，一面要緊你的牙齒，握緊你的拳頭。</p>
<p>法國詩人拉瑪爾丁說過：一個人，好比一枝　，搖撼着想牠掉下果子來，假使没有掉下眼淚，那人是永遠不受　　的。」我們在這裏怎樣你是知道的，你將感到痛恨而不自禁地掉下幾滴眼淚；像晶瑩的眼淚表示你有一颗清醒的心。在　罪惡的淵藪下，麻木不仁而受一點感動而淌淚，竟至相反地發出骯髒的笑，這人定是昏迷的！一昏迷的人多得怕人！朋友，快痛　這些做着夢的带着荒唐的笑的腐屍！我們是過着奴隸的生活，只有悲憤，猛然醒來！</p>
<p>淚是靈魂的血，同肉體的血一樣值得珍視。</p>
<h3>幻想</h3>
<p>— 工力</p>
<p>幻想是一種刺激品，它能使人成功，它能使人快活，但它也能使人發癡，所以你該記牢：「我們要做幻想的主人，切不要做幻想的奴隸！」</p>

<h3>嘉寶的戀愛對象</h3>
<p>— 莎薇</p>
<p>先後五次始終未成婚　熱戀海賽兒尚待考慮</p>
<p>葛蘭泰嘉寳和蓋羅建海賽兒兩人，自從到密士脫山旅行回來後，他們的羅曼史是被每個好萊塢的好事者，作爲茶餘酒後的談話資料了。她第一個在米高梅化裝室裹所接到的電括，就是海賽兒打的；同時嘉寳破例地，准許海賽兒自由出入於她工作時的攝影塲，這正顯出倆人的熱度已到怎樣階段。在這篇文字發表時，也許素以神秘著稱的嘉寳已成爲海賽兒太本，但這事總有點使人狐疑，嘉寳究竟會嫁他嗎？</p>
<p>這兒，把嘉寳的戀愛史來回憶一下，她有過五次羅曼史，但都沒有結婚，第一個是帶她進影界的名導演茂拉士史底勒；第二個，她的銀幕情侶約翰吉爾勃；一九三四年喬奇勃倫又做了她第三個情人；一九三七年寳和大音樂家史托高夫斯基又發生了密切的友誼；所以海賽兒已是她第五次的戀愛對像。</p>
<p>現在一個大問題來了，海賽兒是否會得到勝利，別的幾個人和嘉寳都有過深切的接觸，在她和他們之間，都曾發生過情愛，但第二步的結婚手續，却從沒有實行，這究竟爲什麼呢？那主要的原因很明顯地是嘉寳對婚姻發生了一種畏懼心理，在戀愛和結合兩個步驟中，只選擇了前者而放棄結合，所以如果要推斷這次羅曼史的結局，若她老抱着畏懼態度，那麼她不但不會嫁他，而且也許永遠不會嫁人。</p>
<p>嘉寳和他們的戀愛時期，可說都很短促，這並不是嘉寳的喜新厭舊，實在爲她過分謹愼所致：她對每個普通人都發生了狐疑的感覺，爲她所信託的，只是平時所接觸的少數知己友人。</p>
<p>從這觀際的結論，嘉寳實在太缺乏天然能力，也就是先天不足，在她的體質中，休息和安靜已成爲絕對的要素。當她戀愛時，她的愛情是極專一的，她和別個女子一樣，盡了這樣愛的義務後，自然也希望酬報，那不但是簡單的熱愛，還要有大量的「力」來帮助她本身的缺乏；她常躊躇對方「力」的量，也很明白這種「躊躇」會阻礙她一身的幸福，由是她　　排除。</p>
<p>很可惜地，嘉寳的先天不足，使她對每個人都發生了畏懼，她雖然有熱愛，可是她不完全傾露出來；嘉寳她認爲「結婚」是種神聖的不可輕忽的大事，而她的品性又是嘗高與孤單，因此幾次戀愛的結果都成泡影，她覺得還是把她身心完全獻給事業有意義。</p>
<p>我們可以斷定，嘉寳如果結婚，那麼她的對像一定合乎她理想的標準，所以將來是否是海賽兒夫人，尙是疑問。</p>
<h3>談方言話劇</h3>
<p>— 漁翁</p>
<p>這幾天，方言劇在劇壇上談得很熱鬧。其實，這並不是今日新創的玩意兒，在「八一三」之前，時常有利用七海話表現話劇，在工廠裹，或是在學校中。方言劇的應用，往往適用於特定的範圍中，如往浦東工廠裏去演工人戲，觀衆的對象大多數是浦東人，用國語演戲，有時不能使他們聽得懂；而用浦東話演，反能使他們接受。戰事爆發之後，「到農村去演劇」引起了藝人的注意，而農村劇也多半是利用當地方言來演出的。那些流動演劇隊，並且到處訓練鄕民自己來演方言劇，這些行動，無非是爲了要更急連的達到宣傳和敎育的目的。但方言劇很少在正式的劇塲裹演出，這次華光劇團首先以上海話在璇宮演出了「黃昏（被迫害的改編作），而以上海話演出各幕劇，則以上海劇藝社的上海屋簷下」爲最早，這還是一種嘗試。據說，劇藝社事前請了一位方言劇專家把「上海尾簷下的全部台词改爲上海話，而演出時叉請了許多善於說上海話的演員來參加演出。此劇的內容本來是挿穿上海生活，現在用上海話表演，一定更能使人有親切之感吧。</p>

<h3>Hu Shih and Soong Tzu-wen Visit Hull for Material Aid Negotiations; US to Lend China Another $50 Million; Mao Bangchu Adjusts Aircraft Procurement in the US</h3>
<p>Washington – Chinese Ambassador to the US, Dr. Hu Shih, and former Chinese Minister of Finance, Mr. Soong Tzu-wen, yesterday met with US Secretary of State Hull to discuss the general progress in the Far East for thirty minutes. Both Dr. Hu Shih and Mr. Soong Tzu-wen denied that they had specifically requested the US to provide loans to China. They also dismissed as groundless rumors from Shanghai that the US would soon lend a large sum of money to China. Chinese officials stated that they urgently hoped the US could immediately increase material assistance to China but declined to disclose the nature of the ongoing negotiations. Dr. Hu Shih stated that since the reopening of the Burma Road, a large number of supplies had been transported to Chongqing, but Chongqing still hoped to receive more supplies. Hu and Soong also stated that, to their knowledge, General Chiang Kai-shek had not considered any peace proposals from Japan. At the same time, US Treasury officials stated that they had not heard of any news from Shanghai that the US would soon provide loans to China. (United Press Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Washington – After meeting with Secretary of State Hull, Chinese Ambassador to the US, Hu Shih, told reporters last night that he hoped the US would continue to provide assistance to China. Accompanying Hu Shih to see Hull was Mr. Soong Tzu-wen, who has been in Washington for several months conducting financial negotiations. They declined to discuss the possibility of new US government loans, only saying that they hoped the US would continue to provide assistance. Hu Shih also disclosed that a Chinese Air Force mission led by Mao Bangchu is currently in the US studying aviation developments to adjust China's aircraft procurement in the US. (Reuters Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>US Newspapers Pay Attention to Both European and Asian Wars, Believing China Will Continue to Fight</p>
<p>Washington – The events in the Far East and the European war are both attracting attention in US newspapers today. Reports from Shanghai that the Axis powers are now putting pressure on Chongqing, hoping to persuade Chairman Chiang to make peace with Japan, have aroused considerable interest here. However, it is generally expected to be ineffective, as all indications here suggest that China will continue to fight to resist the Far Eastern representative of the Axis powers. Chinese Ambassador Hu Shih and renowned Chinese financial expert Soong Tzu-wen visited Secretary of State Hull yesterday, and although the content of their discussions has not been disclosed, there is reason to believe that the Chinese representatives have outlined China's needs to continue the war of resistance against Japan. Rumors that China has requested a loan totaling US$200 million have not been confirmed, but it is expected that China could obtain a loan of at least US$50 million. Some observers believe that Japan's recognition of the Wang regime will prompt the US to announce continued assistance to China. The statement made by Admiral Nomura in Tokyo regarding his appointment as Ambassador to the US has also aroused considerable interest here, but officials have not made any substantial criticism of the statement. Secretary of State Hull, when meeting with reporters yesterday, declined to directly criticize Nomura's remarks, only stating that everyone knows the US position, which is to advocate that international relations should be based on law. Some observers interpreted Hull's statement as implying that the US believes Japan's foreign policy often conflicts with this principle. The general feeling is that Nomura may be the most qualified ambassador Japan could send to Washington, but how Nomura can reconcile Japan's policy in China with his statement that all Eastern countries must have continued free and unrestricted relations with other countries is something that many want to see. People here generally feel that Japan's actions speak louder than its words. The Washington Post, in its commentary on the death of Saionji, said that Saionji spent his later years in Japan's tumultuous circumstances, seeing the new Japan he created revert to feudalism, and there was no other option but to die. The New York Times also wrote an editorial stating that Saionji's experience and wisdom had not been utilized by Japan recently, otherwise Saionji's death would have been a significant loss to Japan. Saionji had contributed to Japan's rise and originally wanted to dedicate his remaining years to contributing to the country he had created, but seeing the impetuous elements imitating Hitler and not allowing him to serve, he abandoned his desire to continue living.

<h3>Citibank Hankou Branch Closes Yesterday; US Trade with China Sharply Declines</h3>
<p>New York – Citibank's Hankou branch, which has been established for 38 years, closed today due to the sharp decline in US trade with China since the outbreak of the Far East war. According to bank personnel, there are no plans to close branches in Guangzhou, Hong Kong, Tianjin, and Beiping. The Hankou branch previously played an active role in regulating finances for the export of Chinese goods such as tung oil, but recently Chinese goods have been stockpiled in the interior and are no longer being shipped out, for fear of falling into Japanese hands.

<p>Tokyo – Since Japan accused Americans of aiding the Chongqing Nationalist government, the tense situation between the US and Japan has increased again. Today, Japanese newspapers issued a new warning to the US, stating that Japan has the "determination" to build a new order in the Far East. Tokyo newspapers predicted that Admiral Nomura's mission to the US would not be easy. The influential Tokyo Yomiuri Shimbun stated, "If the US continues to refuse to recognize Japan's determination to establish a new order in East Asia, this difficult situation will not be resolved. The US may recall that Japan had strived to prevent the outbreak of both the Sino-Japanese and Russo-Japanese Wars, but at the final moment, Japan bravely went ahead."

<p>Hull Discusses US-Japan Relations, Saying Only Replacing Ambassadors Will Not Help</p>
<p>Washington – Secretary of State Hull stated yesterday that if Japan wants to improve relations with the US, it must fundamentally change its policies. Simply replacing the Ambassador to the US will not help. Hull reiterated US policy, stating that the US only recognizes the peaceful resolution of international issues and opposes warlike actions, as belligerents are currently doing. The Secretary of State also stated that he and other Americans share the same opinion, having spent years promoting a process to improve international relations through law and order. Hull said that Mr. Nomura has a good reputation on the international stage. Many neutral observers believe that Hull's statement was a welcome to Nomura, but at the same time, it implied to Japan that US policy is firm and cannot be resolved simply by replacing the ambassador. According to officials, the main points of the US process mentioned by Hull are no more than the following eight: (1) Peace, (2) Legality, (3) Fairness, (4) Compliance with treaties, (5) Non-interference in others, (6) Peaceful resolution of international disputes, (7) Fair trade, (8) International cooperation. Hull had stated this doctrine before President Roosevelt was re-elected and called it the fundamental policy of US diplomacy. Hull stated, "Our doctrine has won the friendship of various countries, but not of certain countries because they, under the slogan of 'having nothing', claim to have the right to invade other countries with huge navies and armies."

<p>New York – Washington is considering an unprecedentedly huge naval budget. It is reported that the US naval budget for the 1942 fiscal year is proposed to be $3.3 billion.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Internal Situation of Japan Amidst the Southern Advance</h3>
<p>Although Japan's diplomacy has, in fact, reached a dead end recently, observing its general trends, it still attempts to maintain its offensive externally. Whether it is various military deployments or diplomatic attempts regardless of success or failure, it is actively engaged in them, especially emphasizing the path of southern advance. This newspaper has continuously reviewed it for several days. Before it embarks on such a new major adventure, whether its internal situation has improved and whether all configurations have been completed are major issues. Recently, Kinoshita once stated: "In the near future, a new crisis that will determine the fate of the country for a hundred years will arrive." It can be seen that he not only had a premonition about the current situation but was also quite vigilant. But the problem here is not whether there is awareness but whether there are countermeasures. Now that the elder statesman has newly passed away, there is no one behind the scenes to secretly direct and guide the fate of Japan, and everything depends on the abilities of Konoe and his subordinates. Looking at Japanese history, perhaps the current situation is the most difficult. Before the Meiji Restoration, there were external shackles of unequal treaties and internal overbearing and separatist Bakufu, which were roughly similar to the current situation, but they represented two different eras of new life and decline. In particular, most of the problems at that time came from the outside, while at this moment, all the difficulties are mostly due to itself. If it does not indulge in ambition, does not engage in reckless militarism, and does not regard neighboring countries as its territories and the great powers as deceivable, then the current international community should not hinder Japan's normal development. Among the Japanese, not everyone is unaware of this meaning, but on the one hand, they are intimidated by the power of the military, and on the other hand, they are obstructed by the adverse currents of the international situation, so they can only lurk weakly. Now that Saionji, who represents Japanese liberalism and constitutional government, has passed away, it is expected that this view, unless there are special changes in the internal and external situation, will hardly be able to raise its head for a while. The Japanese authorities headed by Konoe appear to be no different from radical right-wing elements in appearance, but in reality, they are middle-of-the-roaders between extremists and conservative camps. On the one hand, they call for a new political system, but they are still infatuated with the so-called established forces. In their hearts, they imagine that they can control the military, but in action, all their measures resonate with the military. Therefore, radicals criticize them for not being thorough, while conservative camps oppose their reforms. Some people even accuse Konoe's new government of communist suspicions, which requires repeated clarification. Looking at the recent statements of the Kokumin Shimbun, there is hardly anything that does not make things difficult for Konoe and Matsuoka. Right-wing soldiers and the so-called Japanese nationalist factions are particularly opposed to Konoe, and industries and capitalists have also adopted an uncooperative attitude towards Konoe's new government recently. In the early autumn when Konoe came to power, he originally called for the elimination of mutual erosion, but now the effect of unification has not been seen, and Konoe's own faction has become the target of public criticism. Then, even if he has wise understanding and great ambitions, at such a critical moment, it is difficult to imagine how he can make effective use of them, not to mention that fundamentally, he and the blindly radical elements in Japan are only different in degree.</p>
<p>Since Konoe's New Order Movement transformed into the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, its importance and appeal have been greatly diluted. Konoe himself lacks the necessary ambition and does not have a mass base. As a result, the movement he calls for can only be built on the equilibrium of various established forces, forcibly making liberals, totalitarians, and even extreme right-wing Japanese nationalists jointly shoulder the guiding center. In the view of Konoe, Arima, and others, it is to "integrate and consolidate the established forces, subjecting them to an elimination process to suit the needs of national mobilization." However, this process is not something that can be achieved overnight. It must go through a long period of time and proper management to take effect, and it is possible that new disputes may arise due to "mutual erosion." But Konoe placed his ideals on such a complex collective and expected it to play the role of supporting the imminent external adventure, which is truly a mysterious ideal!</p>
<p>The goal of the southern advance is to seize new markets and resources, but the fact is that it is not readily available. Therefore, in the process of its implementation, it must pay a heavy price and find other ways to offset the economic pressure from Britain and the United States. For this need, the Japanese authorities have indeed put in great effort to plan in the economic field. As early as this spring, Japan adopted a policy of diversifying trade, seeking markets in Southeast Asia and Latin America to replace the previous "dependence on Britain and the United States." After the conclusion of the Tripartite Pact, it advocated economic cooperation with Germany, Italy, and even the Soviet Union. On the second of this month, it passed the Sino-Japanese "Manchukuo" Ten-Year Economic Construction Plan to intensify the exploitation of resources on the Asian continent. In addition, the national economic reorganization movement included in Konoe's new political system is embarking on a comprehensive control of Japanese industry, starting in October with the most difficult reorganization of small and medium-sized enterprises. All of this is to break through the current economic difficulties to support its large-scale military needs, which is to achieve the establishment of a so-called highly national defense economy. However, these methods either yield weak results and do not contribute to the overall situation, or they are applied too slowly to be effective in the short term. If the southern advance results in actual action, the huge war expenses and consumption of materials will immediately form a serious problem. Konoe's economic path, like his political path, clearly lacks effective solutions.</p>
<p>A swift success in the southern advance would naturally be enough to significantly eliminate various internal difficulties in Japan. But the problem now is that, except for a part of Vietnam, Japan's attempts will inevitably encounter major obstacles, and the part of Vietnam is clearly not enough to satisfy Japan's desires. Leaving aside military conditions, judging solely from Japan's internal economy and politics, it can be asserted that Konoe's efforts have failed to make the entire machinery of the Japanese empire suitable for large-scale adventures.</p>

<p>Sofia: Yesterday, Bulgarian Foreign Minister Popov and Soviet Deputy Commissar for Foreign Affairs Sobolov held extremely important consultations to discuss the Balkan situation.

<h3>Bulgaria Refuses to Join, Causing Great Disappointment to the Axis Powers</h3>
<p>London: The Axis powers' plan to enlist various small European countries into the Axis front has suddenly come to an unexpected halt. This is likely due to the setbacks suffered by Italy's attempt to invade Greece. The trend of various small countries leaning towards Berlin has suddenly ceased, and the German side also claims that its diplomatic activities have come to an end. It is expected that no other countries will join the Tripartite Pact in the short term. People in Berlin were extremely surprised by this news, as the German side had indicated that Bulgaria would sign the agreement by Wednesday of this week. It was not until yesterday that reports emerged that Bulgaria would postpone the signing, and now there are reports that Bulgaria may not sign and join the Axis after all. (27th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>London: News from Berlin and Rome both indicate that the Axis powers are gradually losing faith that Bulgaria will welcome the "New Order" and are comforting themselves with the addition of Hungary, Romania, and Slovakia to the Tripartite Pact. Soviet Foreign Commissar Molotov and Spanish Foreign Minister Suñer's joint visit to Berlin, in terms of actual and obvious results, was equivalent to not having taken place at all. The German propaganda machine is no longer mentioning this. Several commercial experts accompanied Molotov to Berlin, and at the time there was a sense that Soviet-German commercial relations were about to expand, but to this day, this sense has not materialized. Bulgaria's attitude seems to be swayed by the fate of Romania and the actions of Greece. Greece has inflicted the most severe blow on Italy that the Axis powers have ever encountered. This incident is a timely factor for Bulgaria to decline to lean towards the Axis. In addition, Turkey, a strong neighbor of Bulgaria, has adopted a stance that also prevents Bulgaria from easily taking risky gambles. (27th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Britain Is Willing to Help Bulgaria Maintain Its Independence and Integrity, British Foreign Secretary Offers Promise in the House of Commons on the Condition That Bulgaria Does Not Assist the Axis</h3>
<p>London: Yesterday, it was pointed out that if Bulgaria does not directly or indirectly provide assistance to the Axis powers, then Britain will do its best to help Bulgaria after the war. Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs Butler told the House of Commons that Foreign Secretary Halifax had provided assurance that if Bulgaria does not join the Axis or does not actively or passively assist the Axis, Britain "will do its utmost to ensure a final peace settlement for Bulgaria's independence and integrity." (27th Associated Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Sofia: People here have recently acknowledged that Britain's statement that if Bulgaria does not join the Axis, Britain will guarantee Bulgaria's integrity after victory is a wise move by Britain. This declaration by Britain is purely a counter to the Axis powers' claim that Britain will divide Bulgaria after victory. Political figures also believe that this official statement by Britain will further encourage King Boris of Bulgaria to adhere to his refusal to participate in the war. Another part of the Bulgarian people say that Britain may not necessarily be able to maintain the status quo of this country, which is resisting the state of affairs after the last world war.

<h3>Bulgaria Is Willing to Maintain Good Neighborly Relations with Neighboring Countries</h3>
<p>Sofia: A disturbance occurred in the parliament today when a member, Mr. Tumanhov, launched a scathing attack on Yugoslavia. However, the matter was quelled after several prominent members (including former Prime Minister Giosievalov and Stankov) expressed their strong opposition. Mr. Giosievalov expressed regret for the attack at this time, saying that "we are currently working for peace in the Balkans. The Bulgarian people only seek to achieve their demands by peaceful means and to maintain good relations with neighboring countries. Moreover, the nature of our demands is extremely moderate. Every Bulgarian's heart dreams of an outlet to the Aegean Sea and the Thermaic Gulf, because they are important for our economic development and prosperity." Mr. Stankov said that Mr. Tumanhov's attack was merely an expression of his personal opinion and did not represent the government, parliament, or public opinion. (27th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>Steinhardt in Bulgaria: Soviet Statement Denies</p>
<p>Moscow: Soviet radio and newspapers have widely reported that the news spread by the Axis powers that Bulgarian politicians would not be invited to Berlin is false. Regarding the rumor (not reported by Reuters) that US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Steinhardt made comments after seeing King Boris of Bulgaria, it is considered absolutely untrue here, because Steinhardt has never been to Bulgaria in his life. Since returning here from the United States via the Siberian Railway on September 15th, he has not left Moscow. (27th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Greek Troops Advance in Rain and Snow, Fierce Battles Occur Along the Albanian Coast, Both Sides Vie for the Crucial Town of Telvino, Italian Land and Air Forces Reinforce to Reverse the Decline</h3>
<p>Athens – On the line between Durrës and Vlorë, Greek troops have broken through and reached the Adriatic coast. Meanwhile, Italian forces, strengthened in the southwest, are under orders to defend their positions at any cost, but are isolated due to the Greek advance. Greek troops have made a large-scale breakthrough on the Albanian front today, with the potential to advance to the Adriatic coast. According to recent front-line reports, although Italian reinforcements have included over 30,000 soldiers and dozens of aircraft, Greek troops are progressing rapidly in the lowlands and highlands amidst rain and snow. Italian resistance is only very intense in the extreme southwest between Agioi Saranda and Himarë, as the strengthened Italian forces there have been ordered to defend at any cost. However, according to Greek reports, these Italian forces are also isolated because of the swift Greek advance westward from Moscopole. Recently, an elite Italian unit from Rome joined the battle but was quickly defeated by the Greek troops. The aim of the Greek troops is to isolate the Italian forces rather than to quickly invade Albanian territory. The report states that Greek troops have sent several columns deep into Albanian territory and then attacked the coastal areas or rugged mountain paths, thus encircling the Italian forces. It is said that the Greeks have conducted two encirclements, capturing thousands of Italian soldiers and countless supplies each time. (27th International News Agency)</p>
<p>Athens – According to reports, a most intense battle erupted yesterday around the town of Telvino, a crucial intersection on the Italian supply route from Sarandë to Gjirokastër in Albania. Sarandë is one of the main seaports for supplying Italian troops in Albania. The Italian forces seem prepared to make a final stand in Gjirokastër, but if the Greek troops manage to cut off the Italian supply line at Telvino, the main Italian force will be isolated. Military sources say the Greek authorities have conscripted 3,000 farmers to transport the military supplies abandoned by Italian troops in Moscopole, Greece. After a four-hour rest, Greek troops immediately pursued westward. In the battle for Telvino, Greek troops are using infantry as the vanguard, while the Italian forces are using light, fast tanks for defense. Both sides report that the fighting there is the fiercest yet. (27th Associated Press)</p>
<p>Struga, Yugoslavia – A telegram from the 27th reports that Italian forces trapped in a desperate situation are being fiercely attacked from all sides by Greek warriors and British-Greek aircraft. There will soon be a new commander-in-chief. The Governor of Albania has requested Mussolini to replace the newly appointed commander of the Italian invasion of Greece, General Soddu (who also serves as Undersecretary of the Army). His replacement will be General Guzzoni. The perilous situation of the Italian forces is worsening with each passing day, with major battles in three locations, the most intense being at Telvino.

<p>Athens – Greek radio reports that, in an effort to improve the Italian combat situation, the Italian Army headquarters in Rome has dispatched General Badoglio, one of its military strategists, to Tirana, Albania, to hold an emergency meeting with Italian generals.

<p>Monastir – There are no signs of the Italian forces planning a counter-offensive to threaten the Greek right flank in the Korçë area. The Italian forces are actively preparing along the Yugoslav border, and artillery units have been deployed. (27th Reuters)</p>
<p>Elite Italian Troops Reinforce in Large Numbers, Air Force Venting Frustration with Indiscriminate Bombing</p>
<p>Athens – Well-informed military authorities have recently stated that General Soddu, commander of the Italian forces in Greece, seems to have halted the retreat of Italian troops in some areas, as a large number of elite Italian troops have been reinforced from the coastal area of Agioi Saranda to Lake Ohrid. Assisting these reinforcements are heavy Italian bombers, flying very high and blindly dropping bombs on areas where Greek troops are advancing. Italian military police are executing Italian soldiers who are deserting, hoping to deter others. However, even if the Greek troops are not effectively stopped, their advance into Albania will likely be prolonged. Large numbers of Italian aircraft are constantly flying over the 150-mile front, frequently bombing villages, bridges, and mountain paths in an attempt to cut off Greek communications and impede their advance. Yesterday, when Italian bombers, closely protected by large squadrons of fighters, flew to extreme altitudes over snow-capped mountains and indiscriminately dropped high-explosive bombs into the valleys, almost every town sounded an alarm and was bombed. Troops, farmers, Italian prisoners, and monks have all become victims of the air raids. In some areas, as many as 300 aircraft were hovering over the Greek lines, as British and Greek fighters also mingled with the Italian aircraft to destroy Italian bombers. (27th Associated Press)</p>
<p>Rome – This afternoon, the Italian military report stated that, in addition to reconnaissance along the Greek border, Italian aircraft continued to bomb enemy troops and their key positions, such as the military strongholds of Ersekë and Konitsa, as well as bridges over the Kalamas River and new artillery positions on the heights of Korytsiani. After completing their missions, the Italian aircraft safely returned to their bases. (27th Huitong News Agency)</p>

<p>A Unit of Greek Troops Lands Across the Sea, Disrupting Italian Transportation</p>
<p>Athens – Confirmed reports state that a unit of Greek volunteers crossed the sea yesterday and landed south of the port of Sarandë at Butrint (in Albanian territory), destroying bridges and highways there. Italian aircraft bombed heavily overhead. Seeing that their mission was accomplished, the Greek troops retreated to the islands. (27th Associated Press)</p>
<p>London – Yesterday, military sources here reported that Greek troops landed near the islands of Corfu and cut off the Italian forces' transportation route at Guallanada, at the foot of the mountains in the Agioi Saranda area of western Greece. (27th Associated Press)</p>
<p>Rome – An official Italian war communiqué stated that a unit of Greek marines, coming from the islands of Corfu, attempted to land near the port of Sarandë but was repulsed by Italian troops. Hand-to-hand combat occurred on the beach. This communiqué is the first Italian victory announcement since the Italian withdrawal from Korçë. (27th Associated Press)</p>
<p>One Month of Italian Operations Against Greece, The 18th Division Nearly Halved</p>
<p>Budapest – A Greek radio broadcast received here reports that in the one month of the Italian-Greek war, two Italian divisions have been completely annihilated, and five more have been routed. This great Greek endeavor has resulted in the Italian 18th Division, sent to Albania, being nearly halved. The efforts of the new Italian command to rebuild the Italian army have been thwarted by their rash retreat, and the bombing by British-Greek aircraft and the pursuit by Greek mechanized units, as well as the reckless attacks launched by the Greek forces using captured Italian tanks, have also contributed to the defeat of the Italian forces in this effort. The frequent bombing of Durrës and Elbasan by the British-Greek air forces has prevented the Italian forces from reinforcing their trapped troops via the main roads. At present, all Greek fronts are reporting success. (27th Associated Press)</p>
<h3>German Aircraft Swarms Cross the Channel at Night, Fiercely Attacking Western England, Southampton Bombed for the First Time, British Claim Several German Aircraft Shot Down</h3>
<p>London – The German Air Force bombed western England throughout the night, until dawn today, when all of England was finally free from attack, as the adverse weather was not conducive to German bombers flying into British airspace. Last night, German bombers raided a certain city in western England for some time, with German aircraft entering every few minutes. London was also bombed last night, with some bombs falling within the city, causing damage to people and property. Before midnight, the air raid alert in London was finally lifted. At the same time, it was revealed this morning that Southampton was heavily bombed by German aircraft for the first time. The damage was so severe that residents in some parts of the city were forced to evacuate, unable to return. A British Air Ministry communiqué stated, "Thousands of incendiary bombs rained down on Southampton." Today, British officials also acknowledged that since Coventry was bombed, other cities such as Birmingham and Bristol have also been subjected to similar heavy bombing. (27th International News Agency)</p>
<p>London – On Tuesday, most of the few enemy aircraft that flew over southern and southeastern England during the day were shot down in a matter of moments. This is further evidence of the strength of British coastal defenses. An Air Ministry communiqué stated that two enemy bombers and fighter-bombers were destroyed. British aircraft suffered no losses in the fighting. Bombs fell on a certain town along the Sussex coast, damaging houses and causing minor injuries to several people. The enemy aircraft that attacked on Monday night appeared to concentrate their attacks on cities in the central part of England, with single aircraft flying in continuously for several hours, dropping flares, incendiary bombs, and high-explosive bombs. Two churches, one hospital, one theater, and one cinema, as well as several shops, were damaged. It is reported that three enemy aircraft were shot down southwest of London. (27th Reuters)</p>

<h3>British Ship Losses Since June Average 60,000 Tons Per Week</h3>
<p>London – Shipping Minister Cross stated in a broadcast yesterday that British ship losses since June have averaged 60,000 tons per week, compared to 20,000 tons per week in the early stages of the war. This increase is due to the enemy's control of the Atlantic coast. Currently, most British shipyards are engaged in building naval vessels, so we rely heavily on the United States for the supply of merchant ships. Several cargo ships have already been ordered from the United States and can be delivered next year. (27th Reuters)</p>

<h3>Sino-Vietnamese Economic Negotiations to be Moved to Tokyo, France has Appointed a Representative to Negotiate in Japan, The Governor-General of Vietnam will Also Send Representatives to Participate</h3>
<p>Hanoi – Special Envoy Matsumiya, leader of the Japanese economic delegation, has been here for over a month, holding multiple talks with representatives of the Governor-General of Vietnam. With a spirit of maximum understanding, they have reviewed the viewpoints of both France and Japan. The Japanese delegation has thus obtained sufficient information to serve as the basis for future formal economic negotiations between the two sides. It is learned that these negotiations will be moved to Tokyo, Japan, in a short period. The French government has recently appointed a delegation to negotiate in Japan to formulate new conditions for trade relations between Japan and France. This delegation will be led by the former Governor-General of Indochina, Robin, and will include Colonial Ministry Inspector Lyuffier, Production Department Technician Notin, and Pomar as Secretary-General.

<p>Hanoi – The Vietnamese government has formally requested Associated Press reporters to deny rumors that the Vietnamese government is considering expelling US Consul General Light, US Vice Consul Linton, and Associated Press Hanoi correspondent Jacobi, which have been continuously propagated by Japanese radio and newspapers. Linton and Jacobi were the parties involved in the photography incident in Haiphong last week.

<h3>British Press Magnate Rothermere Dies in Bermuda</h3>
<p>London – London received news last night of the death of Lord Rothermere, the well-known British newspaper publisher and financier, on the island of Bermuda. Rothermere had accepted a special mission to the United States in May at the request of Minister of Aircraft Production Sir Beaverbrook. He subsequently sought treatment in New York due to illness. Shortly thereafter, he went to Bermuda to recover, but ultimately succumbed to his illness at the age of seventy-two. (27th Reuters)</p>
<p>Lord Rothermere was the brother of the former British press magnate Lord Northcliffe. His London newspapers include the "Daily Mail," the "Daily Mirror," the "Evening News," the "Sunday Dispatch," and many provincial newspapers. Rothermere served as the Director of the Army Clothing Department from 1916 to 1917 and as the Minister of Air from 1917 to 1918. Rothermere was quite close to the leader of the British Fascist Party, Mosley. He was a strong advocate for the restoration of Hungary and advocated for the revision of the Treaty of Versailles.

<h3>Further Discussions on the European War 24: The Underground Life of Londoners</h3>
<p>The government originally did not allow residents to take refuge in subway stations during air raids, but the public air raid shelters were insufficient, and the people ultimately valued their lives above all else, so they could not care about anything else and could only temporarily "make do." The poor in London's East End regarded the subway stations as their only paradise. These stations were built 150 feet underground, making them extremely safe. Every evening, or when air raid sirens went off, men, women, old, and young all went there. There, they slept on the platforms, on the stairs, or on the escalators. Every night, there were a total of 120,000 people sleeping on the ground at the Piccadilly, Leicester Square, Holborn, Covent Garden, and Bank stations.</p>
<p>At night, the platforms of the subway stations were packed, and everyone went to sleep. Some brought blankets and pillows, while others leaned against the cold, damp walls in their clothes and fell asleep snoring. Some more sophisticated people even brought hot water bottles filled with snacks, warm water, black tea, or coffee, so they could rinse their mouths, freshen up, and go straight to work in the factory in the morning. There were not many "good seats" in the subway stations, so the early bird got the worm. Before it was even dark, many men and women ran into the station, spread out their blankets on the platform, and practiced their good habit of going to bed early. As for those who came later and could not find a space, they had to choose a step on the escalator to spend the night. The most annoying thing was that when the trains came, the sound of the wheels shattered the silence, making it difficult for everyone to sleep.</p>
<p>Those who took refuge in the subway stations during air raids, apart from those who did not have time to bring anything in a hurry, many people still carried boxes and baskets. Most of the things they could take away and their personal belongings were taken with them. Therefore, in the chaotic situation, it was like travelers rushing to catch a train. The difference was that you didn't need to bring bedding, pillows, chairs, or cloth beds on the train. But on the platforms of the subway stations, these things were everywhere. Some more leisurely people brought bananas, beer, and the like, preparing for a feast. Everyone was crowded in the subway station, which was of course far from being as good as the basements of large hotels. Fortunately, the ventilation equipment inside was not bad, and the air was not too foul. However, there was no hot or cold water at all, and the toilet facilities were very lacking. Each station only had two toilets, and they were not originally designed to serve overnight guests, so naturally there were many inconveniences. This situation was not unique to subway stations. Even the public air raid shelters built by the government were only intended to provide temporary refuge for residents when they were first planned and built, but they did not expect the German planes to bomb continuously, day and night, for two months without stopping.</p>
<p>Most of those who took refuge in the subway stations were from the middle and lower classes. Most of them worked in factories and usually lived in two- or three-story houses. They were not homeless people. Those whose houses were destroyed and who had no personal property were taken care of by the government in shelters, so they did not bother to take refuge in the stations. Even worse than the subway stations were the warehouses near the docks. These large warehouses were made of reinforced concrete and were very strong, much more so than the small houses where ordinary people lived. Whenever an air raid siren went off, they were always full of people. There was no ventilation equipment and no gaps. The windows and doors were closed tightly, and many people were crowded inside, hot and stuffy. The mix of people here was really complicated, even more so than in the subway stations. People of all kinds were lying all over the ground, including breastfeeding mothers, babies, black-skinned Indians, coffee-colored East Indians who had just landed from sailing, white dockworkers, prostitutes, burly dockworkers, and poor people from London's East End. They could always find a place to hide on the ground, but who would feel safe? Therefore, no matter who it was, they would desperately try to dig underground if possible.</p>
<p>The basements of London's major commercial banks and department stores were also excellent air raid shelters. Dickens &amp; Jones on Regent Street was one of the best. Anyone who was relatively poor could take refuge here during air raids. There was good ventilation, and there were washing and toilet facilities. There was also a small bar where you could have a cup of tea for two pence and a piece of cake for four pence. The lights went out after 10:30, and everyone woke up and left early in the morning. Every day at 4:00 in the afternoon, many people were waiting outside the company's door to go in, but the door would not open until 7:00 unless there was an air raid siren. This kind of place was better than nothing and more than enough, and it was an invaluable public air raid shelter.</p>
<p>About one-third of London residents slept in the underground stations, warehouses, and basements of various institutions mentioned above. Another third lived in private air raid shelters, and the remaining third still slept in their own beds. About 40% of the total population of London slept less than four hours a night. Men slept more soundly than women, and children slept better than both men and women. Parents with young children slept the least. In large-scale air raid shelters, the most terrible thing was the outbreak of infectious diseases, because there were so many people and it was difficult to manage. The government was trying its best to install various sanitation facilities.</p>
<p>The so-called "Anderson" air raid shelter was designed by the Home Office specifically for private or family use. Those who could afford it and had space in their backyard or garden mostly built one. Many were also built by the government at its own expense for public use. It was supported by an iron frame inside. The entrance was above the ground and dug deep down, accommodating several people. The top was semi-circular and sloped down, with sandbags and soil piled on top. Some even planted melons, fruits, and vegetables. The internal equipment of this small-scale air raid shelter was simple or complex, depending on the owner's interest. Some people connected the electricity wires in the house to the air raid shelter, so they could study at their desks at night with bright light. In the morning, they could boil some tea and go to the office after eating. People with good taste also put a bookshelf in the corner and hung photos and pictures on all sides to adjust the monotonous air inside. There were also quite a few people who placed radios inside.</p>
<p>When the German air force began to attack England, families with children put their children to sleep in small beds. When they heard the air raid siren, they moved them to the air raid shelter. After the air raid siren was lifted, they moved them back to their original places. Later, because there were too many air raids and it was too troublesome to move them often, they simply put the small beds in the air raid shelter. They said their evening prayers in the air raid shelter at night. Whether there was an air raid or not, they had developed a habit of sleeping in the air raid shelter. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>The Authorities of the Two Concessions Approve the Telephone Surcharge. The Number of Calls is Reduced Simultaneously. The Increased Fees are Very High and Difficult for Citizens to Bear</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Telephone Company, on the pretext of installing new machines, about 16,000 households, because the cost of the machine is high, submitted a request to the工部局 to increase the price. However, because its pricing method is implemented in layers, its degree far exceeds the records of various public utilities, which has caused strong opposition from residents throughout the city, and public opinion is in an uproar. They unanimously requested the Chang局 to re-review and reduce it. All sectors of the city are waiting for the authorities to condescend to public opinion. However, according to reliable information yesterday, the工部局 and the 法公董局 have approved the telephone price increase. The company also decided to start implementing it in the two concessions on December 7. According to the information released by the 工部局 Intelligence Office, the method is as follows:</p>
<p>Increased Fees and Reduced Number of Calls</p>
<p>The 工部局 has recently approved the Shanghai Telephone Company's revision of the telephone fee schedule and the method of collecting temporary surcharges, which will be implemented from November 7. The charging method is as follows: (1) For residential telephones, the number of free calls per month is reduced from 100 to 65, and for business telephones, it is reduced from 150 to 100. The fee for each call exceeding the above number of calls is increased from 3 cents to 7 cents. The current basic monthly telephone fee remains the same. (2) A surcharge of 30% will be levied on all local telephone fees (i.e., a surcharge of 30% will be levied on the basic monthly telephone fee and the increased extra call fee). (3) Installation fees and machine relocation fees will increase by 100% to 150%. (4) The deposit paid by new users should be equal to the basic monthly fee for two years, but the above deposit will be fully refunded if the phone is kept for two full years, and will be refunded pro rata if it is kept for less than two years.</p>
<p>The Demand is Extremely High</p>
<p>According to the company, the demand for telephones from citizens since 1938 can be said to be extremely high, and it is difficult to cope with. Last year, 15,407 new installations were requested. This year and next year, the average is estimated to be 20,600. Recalling that from 1932 to 1938, the average number of requests for new installations was less than 370. It is doubtful whether this development is temporary or permanent. The company currently charges according to the fee schedule approved during 1937. Considering the fee situation of other public utilities and the prices of various commodities, telephone fees are relatively low. In addition, the various industries in this city are developing very rapidly, and the population is overcrowded. Although it is not permanent, the demand for telephones has therefore turned into a sharp increase.</p>
<p>Increased Cost of Adding Machines</p>
<p>In a certain period, the company was able to use the phones dismantled in the second half of 1937 and meet the external needs with the remaining equipment. At that time, the foreign exchange situation was much better than it is now. Recently, due to the greater demand for telephones, various parts and components must be added, so the cost has also increased, especially those parts and components that must be purchased from abroad.</p>
<p>Reasons for the Company's Price Increase</p>
<p>The reason for reducing the number of basic calls and increasing the price of exceeding the number of calls is to reduce the number of calls on the one hand, and to increase the speed of calls on the other hand, and to enable the company to connect a large number of additional phones to the existing switchboard as soon as possible. The reason for increasing the installation fee and the machine relocation fee is partly to offset the increase in wages and material costs. As for the reason for increasing the deposit, it is to provide a considerable guarantee for the company and users to resist the general temporary new users.</p>
<p>Income Increased by 70%</p>
<p>The company's income according to the current charging method not only cannot generate a considerable profit for the investment, but also is not enough to offset the annual depreciation amount. For this reason, the company requested that in addition to the above-mentioned surcharge method, a surcharge item be added so that the company's total income can cope with various expenses (including machine depreciation), and at the same time, its investment can generate the profit allowed by the business charter. In addition, the deficit under its depreciation and other items will also be compensated to a considerable extent. According to the revised fee schedule, the company's income is estimated to increase by 70%. It is hoped that after the increase, there will be surplus funds to engage in the expansion of equipment. The company really cannot consider this under the current situation.</p>
<p>The Bureau Discusses and Approves It</p>
<p>This case has been carefully discussed by the 工部局 for a long time. As a result, it was approved as above, and the 法租界 Public Works Department replied that it agreed and will be implemented from December 7. However, the surcharge item will be reconsidered at any time after 12 months of implementation.</p>
<p>Announced in Advance Without Waiting for Discussion</p>
<p>According to a reporter from 平明社, although the above-mentioned four principles of price increase have been proposed and approved in previous board meetings, the 工部局 announced it in advance yesterday afternoon after receiving the reply from the 法公董局 without waiting for the notification of yesterday afternoon's 4:00 board meeting, which made those familiar with the situation of the 工部局 feel surprised. The Chinese and Japanese directors of the 工部局 are said to be preparing to propose a discussion on the excessive telephone price increase at yesterday afternoon's board meeting.</p>
<p>The Overall Calculation of the Fee Increase is Extremely High</p>
<p>Judging from the principle of price increase announced by the 工部局, the fee increase is very large. Now, leaving aside the installation, relocation, and deposit fees, and only calculating the call fee, the telephone call fee will be charged at the following price from the 7th of next month: (1) Residential telephone, the original monthly fee is 6 yuan and 50 cents, now plus 30%, it is 8 yuan, 4 jiao, and 5 fen. The number of basic calls is reduced from 100 to 65, and each call is 1 jiao and 3 fen. (2) Business telephone, from the original monthly fee of 10 yuan, it is increased to 13 yuan. The number of basic calls is reduced from 150 to 100, and each call is also 1 jiao and 3 fen. (3) The call fee beyond the basic number of calls, in addition to increasing from 2 or 3 fen to 7 fen per call, must also be added with a surcharge of 30%, increasing to 9 fen and 1 li per call. The telephone price increase is so large, which really makes all general users unable to bear it.</p>
<h3>The United States and Japan Held Consultations on the "Da Sheng" Steamer</h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of the American ship "Da Sheng" being detained by the Japanese Navy in the waters of Dinghai at the beginning of this month and not yet released, it is reported that officials from the US and Japanese consulates held consultations once yesterday afternoon in order to reach an agreement. According to US consulate officials, the second protest regarding the detention of the "Da Sheng" will not be filed at least before the two sides talk. The US has received a reply from the Japanese side to the first protest, but US officials believe that the content of this reply is too general and unsatisfactory. The "Da Sheng" is owned by the 華泰 Motor Steamer Company and was stopped by a Japanese Navy cruiser on November 1 on its voyage from Shanghai to Japan, half a day's journey away. Two days later, it was taken to Dinghai and is still there. Passengers on board were initially not allowed to disembark until November 11, when they were transported to Shanghai by a Japanese ship. It is reported that the 37 passengers and 20 crew members on board the "Da Sheng" were very panicked when they caught sight of the Japanese warship. At that time, all papers and documents were thrown into the sea, and money was hidden in secret places on the ship.</p>
<h3>Rumor that Chinese Goods Detained in Vietnam Will Be Confiscated and Nationalized. Vietnamese Governor Orders Customs to Prepare for Auction. Cargo Owners are Panicked and Telegraph the Ministry for Negotiations</h3>
<p>Since the Vietnamese Governor ordered a ban on the export of goods transiting through Vietnam, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, in addition to telegraphing the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for negotiations, also asked the Saigon Chinese General Chamber of Commerce to strive for the release of the goods from the Vietnamese Governor. A reporter from 新聲社 inquired at the 中法 Express Company yesterday and learned that the company had just received a telegram from Saigon, reporting that the Vietnamese Governor had ordered the customs to present the detained goods for auction, confiscation, and nationalization. Upon hearing this, the cargo owners were panicked, believing that the detained goods were all owned by legitimate Chinese merchants, and there was no reason to confiscate them in law or in sentiment. In addition to telegraphing the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to stop it, the Kunming General Office of the 中法 Express Company has also submitted a request to the Chinese government for negotiations.</p>
<p>The Transportation Company Relieves Itself of Responsibility</p>
<p>The Haiphong Company of 中國 通運 Company issued a notice stating that it had previously accepted the entrustment of merchants to transit and store goods in Vietnam that had not been transported, and had already obtained export permits, completed the formalities, and chartered ships, preparing to load and depart from Haiphong immediately. Now, the Vietnamese government suddenly prohibits the export of all goods transiting through Vietnam, resulting in the failure of previous efforts. The company's time and economic losses are huge, which is not to mention. The company is exhausted in terms of the goods stored by customers, and it will be difficult to continue to be responsible for any accidents in the future. Please ask the customers to find a way to pick up the goods quickly to avoid losses.</p>
<p>Cargo Owners Send Personnel to Vietnam One After Another</p>
<p>The goods jointly transported by Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou were previously transported from Shanghai to Haiphong and Saigon in Vietnam, and then transferred to Kunming via the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway. Since the Yunnan-Vietnam transportation was interrupted due to the landing of Japanese troops in Vietnam, a large number of goods are detained in Haiphong and Saigon in Vietnam, especially from Sichuan and Yunnan. The goods are mainly cotton yarn and piece goods. Now, in addition to asking the government to negotiate with Vietnam, the cargo owners have recently sent personnel to Haiphong, Saigon, and other places to negotiate for the pickup of goods, sell them locally, or return them to Hong Kong. However, it is still difficult to predict whether the negotiations will be smooth.</p>
<h3>London Sends a Letter to Shanghai Reporting on Air Force Facilities</h3>
<p>A certain American journalist in this city recently received a letter from a friend in London, describing the current status of British Air Force training. It is said that the British Air Force originally planned to train 50,000 pilots and aviators every year. At present, the plan has been implemented step by step. Of the 67 aviation schools planned to be established in Canada, 22 have already been opened, with about 2,300 students training in them. In addition, there are 16 replenishment schools and 88 airfields, 60 of which are newly built. Canada is the main site for implementing this plan. In the past three years, it has spent 120 million pounds and trained 25,000 pilots and aviators. In addition, Australia and New Zealand have also made great contributions. If Australia's plan is fully implemented, it is estimated that by March 1943, there will be 57,500 aviators and 36 aviation schools. New Zealand can also train 900 pilots and 1,000 people receiving preliminary training every year. In addition to the Canadian Air Force Regiment that has been assigned to protect Britain, Canada also has 116,000 air force personnel, and there are also 1,000 Canadian aviators in the Royal Air Force.</p>
<h3>American Rice and Wheat are Shipped to Shanghai for Relief Distribution. Poor People in Shanghai Will Benefit Greatly This Winter. A Batch of Supplies Will Be Received Every Month Thereafter. A Large Quantity of Medicines is Transported to the Interior via the Yunnan-Burma Road</h3>
<p>The 150 tons of rice and 350 tons of wheat (worth approximately 450,000 yuan) that the American Red Cross arrived in Shanghai last Sunday (November 24) are sufficient to meet the needs of the local branch. It is said that this crushed wheat has only been ground once, and all the original quality of the wheat is completely preserved, so its nutritional value is even greater than that of fully ground wheat. The wheat and rice are stored in white cloth bags, and a paper strip of the American Red Cross is attached to one side. It is said that application letters have arrived in Shanghai from all over, from Peiping to Guangzhou, requesting to allocate a part. Therefore, the Shanghai branch also expects to continue to receive more and greater assistance from the United States in the future. It is expected that in the next few months, a batch of transportation will arrive in Shanghai every month.</p>
<p>The Distribution Method Has Been Agreed Upon</p>
<p>After the association agreed on the distribution method on the 26th, the distribution has started since the previous day. In the past two days, 6,400 bags of wheat and 4,115 bags of rice have been allocated. The distribution method is determined according to the situation in various places. Because wheat is more scarce in various areas of the occupied areas, wheat is allocated to all areas. Rice is the main allocation in this city. The number of bags allocated to Jiangsu Province are as follows: Wuxi 460 bags (same below), Songjiang 600 bags, Zhenjiang 1,000 bags, Suzhou 1,000 bags, Changzhou 400 bags. Zhejiang Province: Hangzhou 1,000 bags, Huzhou 1,000 bags, Jiaxing 500 bags, Dinghai 400 bags. In this city, the Shanghai Anti-Tuberculosis Association gets 400 bags of rice, the Catholic Church's organizations get 2,200 bags of rice and 100 bags of wheat, the Puyi Society gets 300 bags of rice, the Tongren Second Refugee Hospital gets 400 bags of rice, and the Tongren and Guangren Hospitals get 600 bags of rice.</p>
<p>200 Tons of Medicines Transported to China</p>
<p>The American Red Cross has two branches in China, one serving in the Far East, with its president's office in Shanghai, and one serving in Western China, with its general office in Chongqing. In addition, there is also a transportation office in Lashio, Burma, managing the transportation of medicines into China via Burma. There will be 200 tons of medicines transported to the interior of China via the Burma Road, including preservatives, anesthetics, antimalarials, and antidiarrheals, totaling approximately US$300,000. Whether there will be more in the future depends on the situation of the Burma Road and the convenience of transportation. The chairman of the American Red Cross Eastern China Branch is Pei Sai, and his secretary is You Te. It is said that the American Red Cross plans to transport 500,000 quinine tablets from Java to China, which are currently in transit. It is generally expected that 6,000 boxes of toys will arrive in Eastern China before Christmas.</p>
<p>Baker Arrives in Shanghai to Preside Over Everything</p>
<p>The news that Thailand has recently made a request has been rampant, and the price of rice has been manipulated by speculators, and has risen again. The general poor people and refugees in this city are waiting for the enthusiastic relief from all parties at home and abroad. When the various charitable organizations in this city are carrying out winter relief plans, everyone is very pleased to hear the news of the arrival of American rice, wheat, and accounts. This not only shows that the friendship between China and the United States has become more and more cordial, but also the lives of the general civilians in this season may be improved as a result. According to Mr. You Te, he cannot specify what kind of relief supplies the United States is currently shipping to Shanghai. All distribution methods will be decided in Rangoon. The association's director-general, Baker, has been working hard to raise funds in the United States, so he has obtained enthusiastic support from the United States. Baker will devote himself to the work of the Red Cross in the future and will soon return to Shanghai from Chongqing. As for the rumors that American charitable organizations will cooperate with Chinese philanthropists to distribute relief, it has not been confirmed.</p>
<p>A Large Number of Winter Clothes Will Arrive Next Month</p>
<p>The Philadelphia Friends Association branch in this city has made many achievements in refugee relief work since its establishment in March last year. It has repeatedly received various relief clothes from Australia, New Zealand, and various sectors of this city, such as coats, shirts, T-shirts, shoes, socks, and other miscellaneous items. After cooperating with other charitable organizations in this city, they are distributed to refugees who have migrated to Shanghai from the German-occupied areas of Europe. It is learned that on December 8, the "President Cleveland" will transport two large packages of new and old winter clothes from the United States to the Friends Association of Feizhou for distribution to European refugees.</p>
<h3>The Citibank Hankou Branch Announces its Closure</h3>
<p>Business Merged into the Shanghai Branch. The Citibank Hankou branch has recently announced its closure due to the unstable commercial environment there. According to Citibank in this city, all affairs of the Hankou branch will be merged into the Shanghai branch for handling from December 12.</p>
<h3>Punish Severely for Exploitation of Heavy Interest Rates and Unauthorized Price Increases</h3>
<p>In the occupied areas, after the war, the National Government authorities publicized that the interest rate on ordinary loans should not exceed 20%, that is, the highest annual interest rate should not exceed 2%. Nowadays, the trend of exploiting heavy interest rates and merchants manipulating prices by taking advantage of the war has not been eradicated, which is enough to affect people's livelihood. It is reiterated that the above-mentioned prohibition should be strictly enforced. Those who exploit heavy interest rates and hoard goods and raise prices without authorization will be severely punished in accordance with the regulations promulgated in the past. This government order applies to the current occupied areas. Those who are not subject to temporary political forces are allowed to report after the war is over, and those who rely on power to form such acts will be punished one level higher.</p>
<h3>The French Concession Police Make a Solemn Statement</h3>
<p>Strictly Prohibiting Flower Societies Has Never Changed. Recently, there have been rumors that someone has opened a flower society in the French Concession. In fact, the French Concession authorities have always strictly prohibited this kind of organization and still strictly implement it according to the regulations of the Public Works Department and the current laws and regulations, and have never changed their policies.</p>
<h3>Search and Seizure Again on Route de Say Zoong and Other Locations; Tense Situation Causes Panic Among Residents; Rumor of One Worker Arrested</h3>
<p>Residents in the area of extra-settlement roads in Western Shanghai and within the concessions now regard it as a perilous place, due to the frequent unexpected disturbances. Yesterday morning around 10:30, suddenly a large group of over a hundred Japanese soldiers and several dozen so-called "municipal police," in four Japanese military trucks, arrived at the Yaojia Garden area of Yuyuan Road. They divided into groups to surround Bailinan Road, Route de Say Zoong, and Dunsing Road, thoroughly searching residents and pedestrians, creating a tense situation. Residents in the area, recalling the previous blockades of places like Lane 608 on Yuyuan Road, were filled with panic. Fortunately, they left around noon. It is rumored that a worker wearing a blue cloth short shirt and pants was arrested and taken away. The reason for the Japanese military search is unknown. Does the government, while permitting price increases for all trades, also consider the livelihood of ordinary people?</p>
<p>Recommendation to Abolish</p>
<p>A reporter from Da Zhong News Agency has learned that the rice market situation has worsened recently due to renewed rumors. Although national and foreign rice continues to arrive in Shanghai, the local reserves are steadily increasing. However, major hoarders control the spot goods and remain unmoved. Even small hoarders are playing the market, and the trading is like a former exchange, filled with speculative buying and selling, causing prices to rise. The Market Management Committee is unable to lower prices. The only solution is thorough management and the implementation of public sales. While the government cannot exercise its authority, the Municipal Council should take responsibility during this extraordinary period. The original measures for punishing rice merchants are too lenient. Currently, the most important point for stabilizing prices is to immediately lower the price of second-grade rice; otherwise, how will ordinary people survive?</p>
<h3>Noodles to Increase in Price Today; Arrangements for Procuring Foreign Rice Finalized; Ordering from Rangoon if Absolutely Necessary</h3>
<p>A certain rice firm revealed that it had received a telegram from a Hong Kong counterpart stating that a Hong Kong shipping company had received an urgent telegram from its Vietnam branch. The Vietnamese government had ordered the prohibition of French ships sailing to Hong Kong at the beginning of this month. However, ways have been found to ship Saigon rice directly to Macau, and then it can be transshipped to Hong Kong and Shanghai. At the same time, the export of Siam rice has more than doubled, most of which is shipped to Hong Kong and Shanghai. According to a rice industry group, if absolutely necessary, large quantities of foreign rice can be procured from Rangoon (Burma) and shipped to Shanghai for adjustment. Therefore, there is no need to worry about a food shortage in the city.</p>
<p>Future of Rice Prices</p>
<p>The key issues leading to the soaring rice prices are as follows: (1) Although the national rice production is ample, the supply is still not double that of the past, making it easy for speculative rice merchants to use as an excuse. (2) The unstable international situation and the tense situation in rice-producing areas have caused people to hoard and refuse to sell easily, resulting in an imbalance between buying and selling, and making goods scarce and expensive, leading to frequent price increases. (3) The relevant authorities fail to keep their promises and miss opportunities, relying only on empty words, resulting in a loss of credibility. Therefore, to stabilize the entire food supply in Shanghai, the relevant authorities must supervise and direct policies, seize the opportunity to order large quantities of national and foreign rice, dispatch special ships to transport it to Shanghai for storage, increase food reserves, and supply the rice to the market at discounted prices to calm the people.</p>
<p>Noodle Price Increase</p>
<p>The Municipal Council has approved the price increase for the flat-priced flour sold by Fuxin and Fufeng flour mills, from 17.3 yuan to 18.3 yuan starting from the 25th of this month, increasing the cost of noodles. In order to find a relief measure, the Noodle Industry Association sent representatives to visit Vice Director-General Hoderkui of the Public Concession Municipal Council yesterday. Mr. Ho personally received them and approved the increase of the market price of noodles from 3.6 cents per catty to 3.8 cents, to be implemented starting today. At the same time, it was instructed that all members of the industry should uniformly comply with the price list agreed upon by the association and not increase the price of noodles privately.</p>
<h3>Kidnapping Cases Become Increasingly Bizarre; Two Young Children Abducted Yesterday; Rumor That a Two-Year-Old Child of the Chuan Family Was Rescued Midway; Four-Year-Old Son of the Ho Family Abducted and Missing</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, two cases of kidnapping young children occurred successively on Race Course Road and Dunsing Road in Western Shanghai in the Public Concession. However, the former child was intercepted on the spot, while the latter's whereabouts are unknown. The details of the two cases are as follows:</p>
<p>Kidnappers Entered Building and Carried Away Child</p>
<p>The kidnapping case on Race Course Road occurred at 7:30 yesterday morning. Three kidnappers broke into the home of Chuan Lung-chien, a Ningbo native, at No. 18, Chengqi Lane, No. 69 on Race Course Road. They went straight upstairs to Chuan's bedroom. One kidnapper stood guard by the stairs, while the other two showed pistols, preventing Mr. and Mrs. Chuan from making any noise. They picked up Chuan's two-year-old son, Yi-ping, from the bed, went downstairs, and fled out the door. Chuan saw the kidnappers leave and immediately got up and chased after them, and reported to the police post. The police bravely went forward to pursue the kidnappers. Seeing that the plan had failed, and because the police sirens were blaring, they had no intention of staying, and hastily threw the hostage to the ground and fled wildly. The patrolling police in the area, hearing the alarm, came to encircle and capture them. As a result, one kidnapper was caught on the spot, while the other two escaped without a trace. Chuan runs the Lao Yongcheng Leather Goods Shop, and his family is only moderately well-off.</p>
<p>Ho Child Abducted on the Way to School</p>
<p>Only fifty minutes after the previous case occurred, another kidnapping case occurred on Dunsing Road in Western Shanghai. Ho Shih-chen, a native of Anhui, is the former president of Chi-Chih University and a practicing lawyer. He resides at No. 30, Lane 42 on Dunsing Road. His four-year-old son, Tso-kun, is currently studying at the Xizhen Girls' Elementary and Middle School in the Zhamiao Lane, Jing'an Temple. At 8:20 yesterday morning, Tso-kun, accompanied by a bodyguard from home, took a chartered car to school. Unexpectedly, as soon as the car left the lane, six kidnappers suddenly appeared. Three kidnappers produced pistols and abducted Tso-kun into a silver car No. 18253 parked on the corner of the road and sped away. Afterward, the Ho family reported to the Jing'an Temple police station and requested an investigation. The police found that the car used by the kidnappers was rented from the Silver Car Branch on Yuyuan Road at 8:00 am by the kidnappers. The driver, Yu Shao-yang, drove the car. Unexpectedly, when the car passed Yaojiajiao, Caojiadu, the kidnappers in the car pulled out a gun and forced the driver to get out of the car, detaining him in a small bungalow for a long time. Around 9:00 am, the guarding kidnapper released Yu. Yu also reported to the police station. Around 10:00 am, the car was found within the jurisdiction of the police station. The police station is now investigating the case. It is reported that when the kidnappers carried out the kidnapping, they confiscated the bodyguard's pistol. The whereabouts of the abducted Tso-kun are still unknown.</p>
<h3>Relocation of Western Boys' School Not Yet Decided</h3>
<p>According to the English-language *Shanghai Evening Post*, parents of students at the Western Boys' School continue to express strong dissatisfaction with the Municipal Council's decision to relocate the school to the barracks left by the British troops in Zhaofeng Park. Their reasons are that the British barracks are insufficient for classrooms, the location is inconvenient, and there are many dangers. The Municipal Council remains silent on the progress of this matter. According to Mr. Nash, Assistant Secretary-General of the Municipal Council, the situation has not changed since yesterday. Relevant personnel are holding meetings and may reconsider the matter. The Bureau does not need to inform the press of developments at any time. However, Nash refused to confirm that the Municipal Council had decided to move the Western Boys' School away from its current temporary location (No. 2811, Kaina Road), only stating that the Bureau is still considering the entire matter. After the British troops stationed in Shanghai withdrew, their barracks in Zhaofeng Park, consisting of fourteen wooden houses, were partially damaged. It is reported that the Municipal Council has been sending workers to actively repair them since the 10th of this month, and it is expected to be completed within a month.</p>
<h3>Governments in Various Parts of the Far East Inspect Mail to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Since the situation in the Far East has become tense, governments in various places have been inspecting incoming and outgoing mail. According to the Datong News Agency's inquiries with the Shanghai Post Office, a large number of mails arriving in Shanghai from Hong Kong, Singapore, Manila, and other places have been opened and inspected by local governments. After inspection, they are sealed and signed on the opening of the envelope and stamped with the inspector's seal. The procedure is very thorough, but due to the inspection, the round trip will inevitably be slightly delayed.</p>
<h3>Zhao Wuji's Art Exhibition</h3>
<p>Starting today, the works of the young painter Zhao Wuji will be displayed at the Sincere Company on Nanjing Road from today until the 2nd of next month, holding a solo exhibition. Zhao's early works were deeply influenced by the famous modern French painter Matisse. Later, Zhao studied the works of modern Western painters such as Derain, Gauguin, and Cézanne, and his style changed, his thinking became serious, and he reached a stage of magnificence and maturity. In addition, after the war, he traveled to various places in the Southwest and experienced much of real life. Therefore, his later works are more strongly reflective of the spirit of the times.</p>
<h3>Municipal Council Considers Abolishing Petty Rents; French Concession Already Has Rectification Plan</h3>
<p>Since the French Concession Municipal Council recently proposed abolishing the petty rent system, the Public Concession Municipal Council may also take similar action. According to a spokesman for the Municipal Council yesterday, the Municipal Council is currently considering the matter. Whether this matter was discussed at the special meeting of the Municipal Council yesterday, and whether it will be carried out jointly with the French Concession Municipal Council after a circular, will be announced to the public soon, but it cannot be revealed at this time. At the same time, French Consul General Magre is still considering the French Concession Municipal Council's proposed measures regarding various rent issues. The Shanghai Tenants' Association calls the abuses such as petty rent "fraud," and the French Concession Municipal Council's recently published long report also states the illegality of this practice. The French Concession Municipal Council believes that the fierce movement against landlord exploitation in the French Concession is related to the arrival of French Consul General Magre. It is said that Magre is very interested in rectifying the chaos of rental housing in the French Concession.</p>

<h3>Land Rent Calculated in Pounds; Lawsuit Over Different Exchange Rates</h3>
<p>Hutong Foreign Firm Charges According to HSBC's Exchange Rate</p>
<p>Zhu Jieren Uses Central Bank's Exchange Rate as Standard</p>
<p>Special First Court Ruled Against Zhu Jieren Yesterday</p>
<p>Dozens of businesses and residences, such as Tongyuchun and Sanyou Industrial Society on Nanyang Road in the Public Concession, are owned by real estate developer Zhu Jieren, and the land belongs to Hutong Foreign Firm. The houses there are</p>
<p>Built on Leased Land</p>
<p>The original land lease contract between the two parties was for a period of fifteen years, from 1916 to 1941, expiring next year. The houses will also belong to Hutong Foreign Firm. In the land lease contract, it was originally stipulated that the land rent would be calculated in Shanghai taels converted from pounds. For more than twenty years, Zhu Jieren paid the rent in Chinese currency converted from pounds. In recent years, because the Central Bank's posted</p>
<p>Sino-British Exchange Rate</p>
<p>is one shilling and two and a half pence, which is very different from the rate posted by HSBC, Zhu Jieren argues that the rent should be paid based on the Central Bank's rate. Hutong Foreign Firm disagrees. Because Zhu Jieren had owed land rent for six installments up to July of this year, with each installment being three months and the rent being one hundred pounds, the total amount owed was six thousand six hundred pounds. The firm recently commissioned lawyers Ma Shouhua, Cao Shoulin, Xu Runquan, etc., to file a lawsuit in the Civil Division of the First Special District Court, requesting that the defendant Zhu Jieren</p>

<h3>Painter Disregards Human Relations and Adultery with His Nephew's Wife</h3>
<p>Uncle and Nephew Clash; Both Seriously Injured</p>
<p>Wu Chunyuan, a Yangzhou native residing in the pavilion room at No. 59, Lane 590, Haining Road, is a painter. He is advanced in years and has always been fond of women. After his old wife passed away, he often enjoyed himself with female tea servers (i.e., waitresses) in various entertainment venues. Recently, his nephew Wu Hengmao and his wife, Dong, (24 years old and slightly attractive) moved in from somewhere to live in the attic on the second floor. Wu Chunyuan disregarded his status as an elder and teased Dong. Then, taking advantage of his nephew Hengmao's absence, he had sexual relations with Dong, secretly committing adultery several times. Later, his nephew Hengmao discovered this, but did not witness it. So he sent his wife Dong to work as a helper in a mansion at No. 29, Duofu Lane, Fuxu Road. At 5:20 on the 27th morning, the uncle and nephew suddenly had a big argument. Wu Chunyuan grabbed a sharp knife from the table, intending to kill his nephew. They grabbed each other and fought, resulting in both of them being seriously injured, bleeding profusely, and collapsing to the ground moaning. The second landlord, Wang Mingfang, urgently reported to the local Huizi police station, which sent Chinese and Western detectives to the address. They sent the uncle and nephew to the Northern Tibet Road Refugee Hospital for treatment. Yesterday morning, the case report was sent to the Third Criminal Division of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin explained the case. Because both parties were seriously injured and unable to attend court, the judge was asked to postpone the hearing. Huang Risheng postponed the hearing until Wu Chunyuan and Wu Hengmao recover from their injuries and the facts are verified.</p>
<p>Bullets Fly on Baylor Road; One Thief Killed</p>

<p>Jie Meisheng, a Zhenjiang native, is a pig vendor and lives at No. 60, Yongyu Lane, Ximen Road in the French Concession. At about 4:30 yesterday afternoon, four robbers suddenly broke in. All four robbers produced guns, forbidding anyone from making a sound, and searched at will. They robbed gold and silver jewelry and cash, worth about 3,000 yuan in legal tender, and fled out the door. The victim followed and reported to nearby Chinese police. The police sounded the alarm. Knowing that things were not good, three robbers fled south on Ximen Road and Baylor Road, and one robber fled north on Baylor Road, firing shots to resist arrest along the way. The detectives also drew their guns and returned fire. The two sides exchanged more than twenty shots. As a result, one of the robbers fleeing north was hit by three shots, one in the head and two in the abdomen, and collapsed in a pool of blood at the entrance of Wangde Lane on Baylor Road, dying on the spot. A pistol and five bullets were found on him. The other three robbers escaped without a trace. At that time, Su Dinggan (43 years old, a native of Tongzhou), the old clerk of a coal shop at No. 562 Baylor Road, was carrying a load of coal balls on his shoulder when he passed near Wangde Lane and was hit in the right arm by a stray bullet. The police sent him to Guangci Hospital for treatment.</p>

<h3>Securities Exchange Switchboard Operator Conspires With Gang for Fraud and Theft</h3>
<p>Forgery of Warehouse Receipts to Defraud Yarn Payments; Six Criminals Arrested for More Than Ten Robbery Cases</p>
<p>Xu Zhongya, a native of Suzhou, works as a telephone operator for the Taifeng Yarn Shop in Room 213 of the Securities Building on Jiujiang Road. Therefore, he is very familiar with the transactions within the shop. Recently, Xu learned that Taifeng had purchased 20 bales of Huai yarn from Shengxing Yarn Shop at No. 1, Lane 24, Jiangxi Road, with the agreed market price being 25,225 yuan. Xu, before</p>
<p>the Transaction Was Completed</p>
<p>conspired with his friends Shen Yajie, Li Fanglun, Ji Huisheng, Li Zhenhua, and Lu Shiheng to forge a paper of Anyu Qianzhuang banknotes to Shengxing for delivery. Chengxing Shop believed that they were sent by Taifeng Shop, and handed over the warehouse receipt. After Shen and others obtained the warehouse receipt, they used the receipt to collect two banknotes of 25,225 yuan from Meifeng Xingye from Taifeng. However, these banknotes could not be directly cashed at the bank. Shen and others took the notes to Fei Wenwu Silver Shop on Nanjing Road and</p>
<p>Purchased Gold Bars</p>
<p>four gold bars, carried them to Gaoqiao in Pudong for temporary storage, and waited for the situation to calm down before selling and distributing the loot. However, the intricate fraud scheme created by Xu, Shen, and others was exposed due to the exposure of Anyu Zhuang's forged banknotes. After the two shops reported to the General Police Department, Chinese Inspector Jiang Shangpei and Detectives Ren Fengwu and Peng Bingsheng made every effort to investigate and completely exposed it. The detectives</p>
<p>Arrested</p>
<p>Xu Zhongya, Shen Yajie, Li Fanglun, Ji Huisheng, Li Zhenhua, Lu Shiheng, etc. at No. 520, Dongya Hotel, and No. 207, Sutai Hotel, etc.</p>
<p>The four gold bars were found in Gaoqiao. A pistol and five bullets were also found at the home of Li Fanglun at No. 210, Beihai Road. It was found that Xu and others, in addition to setting up fraud schemes, also specialized in robbing yarn shops, committing no less than ten cases. When they robbed, they always bound the plaintiffs, such as the case where Wuheng Qianzhuang's 4,000 yuan remittance to the Huafeng Exchange Shop in the Guohua Building was robbed,</p>
<p>Issue of Responsibility</p>
<p>A case that is now being litigated in court between Yuanheng and Huafeng, was also committed by Xu and others. Yesterday morning, the case was sent to the First Criminal Division of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu stated that the defendants committed more than ten robbery cases in addition to fraud, and that the investigation was not yet complete. Therefore, it was requested that the hearing be adjourned. After reviewing the report and questioning the defendants, Chuan Lin ordered them to be detained for a later hearing.</p>
<h3>Financial Speculators Enter Foreign Exchange Futures</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no fluctuations in HSBC's posted rates. The black market for British and American exchange remained tense. The American exchange rate once rose to 5.84375 yuan due to speculators' efforts to push up prices, while the supply from non-professionals was limited. Later, due to negative rumors, it rebounded, but ultimately softened due to hesitant sellers and extremely strong demand for futures. However, compared with the previous day, both the spot British and American exchange rates for this month were flat, while those for the next month were reduced by 0.015625 and 0.03125, respectively.</p>
<p>Limited Supply from Foreign Banks</p>
<p>In the morning, the London big bar was flat for both near and far terms. The New York silver price remained flat. The London raw gold was fixed. The exchange rate between the British and American currencies was flat in Shanghai. The American currency was up slightly by two points against the British currency, but there was no market for the French currency. The central bank's posted rates for all currencies remained the same. Banks opened the spot selling price in the morning, with the British gold at 3.75 pence and the American exchange at 5.875 yuan, the same as the evening closing on the previous day. After opening, speculators aggressively pushed up the price of American exchange futures, and the market continued to tighten. It was estimated that non-professionals gave Chinese merchants 5.85 yuan for December, but because the supply from non-professionals was very thin and there were few positions, Chinese banks took the opportunity to sell American exchange for the next month at 5.84375 yuan. At 9:30, HSBC announced that the posted rates were uniformly unchanged, and the silver tax was also flat. Thereafter, rumors spread that a new Sino-American loan had been established. People reacted to the news by shorting the market, and speculators covered their positions. Foreign firms also closed their positions. The December price rose from 5.875 yuan to 5.90625 yuan. The market closed softly at noon, with the spot and current month's British currency at 3.75 pence and the American exchange at 5.875 yuan. The December British currency was at 3.734375 pence and the American exchange was at 5.84375 yuan, with the spot and current month's British and American exchange rates unchanged from the previous day, and the next month's rates tighter by 0.015625 and 0.03125, respectively. There was no market in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Gold Price Attempts to Rise but is Blocked; Swap Session Advanced by One Day</p>
<p>Yesterday's bare metal market rose and then suddenly fell back. The price broke into the 5,700 yuan mark several times. It was rumored that the bond market suddenly heard that the United States would continue to lend to China 50 million yuan, and people's minds changed from firm to uncertain. In the morning, it was heard that foreign exchange was tight, and silver shops covered their positions, and the price had risen to 5,725 yuan. Subsequently, the buying trend continued to fly up to 5,745 yuan. When the rumor of interest-bearing sales was heard, bill merchants and gold shops scrambled to sell short. As the multiple parties crushed each other, a falling wind arose, and it madly retreated to 5,688 yuan. Later, although a certain gold shop and silver shop were seen covering their positions, it sparked another sharp rise, but the foreign exchange had stopped tightening and returned to flat, causing another fallback, ultimately to 5,705 yuan, a small difference of ten yuan. The half-day transaction totaled more than 3,000 taels. There was no market in the afternoon. Small money houses did dozens of taels of swaps, with buyers paying sellers four yuan. Cash transactions were not deserted. The price was initially six yuan lower than the term delivery, and was once as low as four yuan, later around five yuan. Ornament gold, customs gold, etc. were all flat. It is said that this 30-day swap session, coinciding with the holiday on Sunday, has been advanced to Saturday (29th) from 8:00 AM to 9:00 AM. Thereafter, swaps will be reduced to once a month, taking place on the 15th of each month. If there is a holiday, it will be held one day in advance.</p>
<p>Bare Metal Falls by Ten Yuan</p>
<p>Early in the morning, the QianDui industry first entered the silver shop with 20 taels, at 5,725 yuan, which was ten yuan higher than the previous day. Because the silver shop was eager to cover its positions, it continued to rise by 20 yuan under the buying trend, and the gold shop traded 30 taels at 5,745 yuan. Later, it was heard that the outer cabinet was slightly longer, and the news of the success of the Sino-American loan was spread, and the interest-bearing empty sales wind was agitated, and the securities help out of the silver shop 20 taels, at 5,688 yuan. However, a certain silver shop saw the low price and continued to cover its positions, and the price improved to 5,725 yuan, and the gold entered the QianDui industry for 30 taels. The securities help and others suddenly came to vomit, and the small money house also sold, and retreated to the 700-yuan mark, and the securities help out of the gold shop 20 taels, 5,700 yuan, and the gold shop entered QianDui industry 20 taels at noon, rose back eight yuan, to 5,70 yuan. The silver shop entered the QianDui industry for ten taels at the closing, offsetting 5,705 yuan. There was no market in the afternoon, with the bare metal having a ten-yuan difference and a fifty-seven-yuan change for half of the day. The brand gold sold by the current gold shop is more than ten yuan higher than the bare metal, and the closing is thirty yuan lower. The current standard gold is lower than the listed gold by fifty-sixty yuan, and it is rare to open.</p>
<p>〇〇〇〇〇Ornament Gold Has Not Changed〇〇〇〇〇The gold price per tael for ornaments in silver shops has not changed. The Da Tong Hang is listed at 590 yuan, and the New Tong Hang is similar to the above price, and the closing is about 30 yuan lower.</p>
<p>The Rise and Fall of Japanese and Korean Tickets Differ</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market, the price of bare metal, fell after rising. The British, American, and gold pounds also rose and then fell, and finally fell by five jiao. The British gold ticket tended to be steady, and the market price remained flat. The American gold ticket fluctuated. It once rose to 16.87 yuan, then retreated to 16.69 yuan, and finally ended at 16.78 yuan, a final rise of one point from the previous day. The supply and demand of Hong Kong tickets were uniform, and the market price remained flat. The Japanese gold ticket suddenly softened again, and the exchange rate retreated to 1.535 yuan. The demand for Korean tickets was more urgent, and the market price turned up, rising to 1.155 yuan in the evening.</p>
<h3>Grains: The Price of Foreign Rice Increased Again in the Afternoon, 60-70% Supported by Speculators</h3>
<p>Spot foreign rice sales have slowed, and foreign demand has decreased. Yesterday's market saw stability, but rice shipments along various routes remain favored by hoarders and speculators. The market continues to rise, as the rice market has deviated from the norm. Sixty to seventy percent of market transactions are supported by speculators. Since futures foreign rice is being manipulated by speculative groups, the market fluctuates accordingly. Short-term speculators are also fueling the situation. As a result, the market was stable in the morning but surged again in the afternoon. Prices for both near-term and distant deliveries have increased by over a yuan. No. 1 Saigon spot rice, originally at $88.50 per bag in the morning, rose to $89.50 in the afternoon. December rice went from $84.50 to $85.00. No. 2 spot rice was at $85.00, with December at $83.30. November rice was only $82.50 in the morning, but it closed as high as $83.50 in the afternoon. Small grades have attracted the attention of local traders. December rice rose from $80.57 in the morning to $82.00 in the afternoon. Rice shipments along various routes were at $82.00 in the morning, with bids reaching over a yuan higher in the afternoon, but no deal was reached. Total rice transactions for the day were only 6,000 to 7,000 bags, and the Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. still holds around 1,000 tons.</p>
<p>1,300-1,400 piculs of new japonica and tea rice arrived, mostly tea rice. Sales of tea rice are sluggish, causing the price of medicinal rice to decline by a yuan. It opened at $80.05. The supply of new japonica rice is stable, with no price changes. It opened at $93.00 per original bag, with select grades at $88.20 per picul and lower grades at $86.00. Du Jian rice also saw little change, selling for $78.30.</p>
<p>Glutinous rice sales have slowed, causing the price to soften by about half a yuan. Guanshi glutinous rice opened at $85.00 and $83.00. Hong Kong round-grain glutinous rice was $77.00, long-grain glutinous rice was $75.00 and $74.00, and yellow glutinous rice was $73.00.</p>
<p>Foreign flour is active, while factory flour is stable.</p>
<p>The spot flour market remains stable. Factory flour is still at $18.00 per bag. The two mountain factories have sold about 8,000 bags, designated for retail sale by various dealers, with no surplus available. Consequently, old-stock and Fuxin flour cannot be purchased for the time being. All dealers are paying attention to foreign flour. The recent arrival of Australian flour has taken advantage of this opportunity and is quite popular among local customers. It is reported that foreign hoarders have become active again and are accumulating shipments of foreign flour. The current price of Flower God brand flour is $19.50, with December futures opening at $18.50, up 20-30 cents from previous prices. Due to the high prices, demand for spot flour is increasing. Large shipments of foreign flour are expected to arrive in early December. The market will have to wait for the supply of foreign flour to lower prices.</p>
<p>The wheat market is also firm. Domestic supply has been scarce for a long time.</p>
<p>Chinese factories are unwilling to raise prices to buy wheat because they cannot find any available. However, it is rumored that Japanese factories have been actively buying available wheat. It is reported that a certain grain merchant has made a deal for 15,000 bags of Kuntan wheat for December delivery at $28.00. Domestic reserves are not yet depleted, but transport permits are difficult to obtain, so supplies cannot be transported for the time being.</p>
<h3>Securities: Long Positions Mostly Closed Out, Domestic Debt Market Remains Firm, London Foreign Debt Continues to Improve</h3>
<p>The informal securities market was initially weak but later strengthened due to the surge in the prices of Chinese government bonds on foreign markets. However, excessive selling pressure prevented prices from rising. Class C bonds fell below $4.00 and then broke further, and are no longer as strong as before. Market sentiment has weakened slightly, and the future may see a period of consolidation before changing again based on domestic and international developments. Trading was light yesterday. Hongda and Xinfu were still buying, and Lianyi, Dunyu, and Hengfu also had demand in the morning. Changkang and Runli were bullish on small price increases. Zhenda, Jiufeng, and Changji were all selling, but prices continued to rise. Class C bonds broke through $64. In the afternoon, Hongda and Xinfu continued to buy, and Yitai, Shengda, and Lemao also bought. Prices opened firm, but Hengfu and Lianhe turned to selling. Dahua, Runde, and Tongshun sold heavily, and short positions also emerged. Prices broke below $4.00 again. In the end, prices recovered slightly by a few cents. 96 bonds saw little trading. Total trading volume was about 180-190,000 yuan. A concise table is listed below.</p>
<p>Yesterday's stock trading saw 100 shares of China Trust stock change hands at $14. The Shanghai Stock Exchange saw slightly better sentiment, but it remained dim. Prices did not change much, and trading was very quiet.</p>
<p>A telegram from London, dated the 26th (Tuesday), reported that today's listed prices for Chinese foreign debt and Far Eastern British company stocks showed improvements. Customs bonds "Yingfa" rose another one pound to $24. The long-dormant Sino-French-American 5% gold loan was listed at 35 to 40 pounds. The rest were stable, and British stocks also saw no changes.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Very Few Silk Deliveries</h3>
<p>Recently, deliveries of silk and tea have been very scarce, especially raw silk. As a result, trading in the local market has been quiet. Foreign firms found it difficult to raise prices. Yesterday, Da Chang, Yihe, and other foreign firms had some transactions. Jili silk, first and second grade, sold for $3,400. Top grade Da Shanghai and Guohua silk sold for $3,800. White factory silk, 0.22.78, sold for $4,650.</p>
<p>Due to a lack of outlets for white factory raw silk, prices are about $1,000 lower than those of foreign firms. In the Suzhou, Hangzhou, and Wuxi areas, prices are only around $2,700-$2,800. Due to the control system, they could not be shipped to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Rumors of a Guangdong Syndicate Monopoly, Yarn Market Softens</h3>
<p>The yarn market has returned to a volatile situation. This is because actual business has decreased, leading to weaker sentiment. Short sellers are active, and the market is soft, but the core of the long positions remains unchanged. Only a few followers have given up. Today, rumors spread that money was blocked at the Sha Yu Chung port, causing a temporary loss of confidence and a drop in prices. Reports that the Hong Kong syndicate is still handling nearly 100 bales of cotton yarn were vague. These rumors are difficult to confirm. Yesterday, five bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Xiamen and 255 bales to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Shuang Ma opened bullish in the morning because the exchange rate had tightened in the afternoon of the previous day. Gold dealers and speculators were buying. The opening price was $1,222. After this opening, buying was strong, pushing the price up to $1,228. Suddenly, rumors arose in the market that the Guangdong syndicate had sold 400-500 bales of Shuang Ma futures, indicating a bearish outlook. As a result, short sellers became very active, and the market plummeted to $1,105. Following profit-taking, the price rose again to $1,216. The closing price was $1,210. It is estimated that 6,052 bales were traded in half a day. The price of 20-count Shuang Ma fell by $4. The amount of yarn purchased by each syndicate is listed below.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market: No Major Changes</h3>
<p>Spot cotton trading was slightly active, but there were no major changes in prices. Industry sentiment was positive, but factories were not buying, so the trend remained hesitant. Fire-engine grass-cloth cotton was priced at $201, plain cotton at $168, and Brazilian cotton at $280. Yesterday, 220 bales of cotton were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The international cotton market was firm and active in New York. Subsequently, due to heavy rainfall in cotton-growing areas and some short covering, the closing price rose by 2-3 points compared to the previous day. The price in India fell by more than one rupee.</p>
<p>Transactions of foreign cotton in Shanghai have been unusually quiet recently. All parties are taking a wait-and-see approach. The industry's willingness to purchase is very weak, so no transactions were heard of throughout the day.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Factory Orders Being Transferred to Warehouses</h3>
<p>The factory cloth market was firm and steady yesterday, with frequent transactions. Cloth prices were stable. Dyeing factories and merchant groups were increasingly eager to buy. Factory and warehouse orders were being transferred to warehouses to avoid increased factory taxes. All warehouses reported being full. Sales prices were generally flat, but Luen Chang, Yihe, and other factories were short of valley cloth, and prices rose by 25-50 cents per piece. About 800 pieces of various cloths were traded in the local market. Guangdong and Hong Kong syndicates handled over 400 pieces of colored cloth, bleached cloth, poplin, coarse cloth, and fine cloth. The Zhejiang and Fujian syndicates handled over 100 pieces of colored twill, bleached cloth, serge, and poplin. The Yantai syndicate in the north handled over 100 pieces of coarse cloth. Yesterday, 283 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong, 40 pieces to Xiamen, and 200 pieces are scheduled to be shipped to Yantai today.</p>
<p>Eastern cloth continued to soften. White cloth, fine cloth, and fine twill fell by 10-20 cents per piece. 12-pound fine cloth closed at $35.15, and Four Gentlemen Serge at $1.075.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains: Soybean Sales are So-So</h3>
<p>Recently, the soybean market has been weak due to the rumored opening of Dalian and lackluster sales, leading to depressed sentiment and falling prices. The trend remained weak yesterday. However, in the after-market, as the Hong Kong syndicate continued to make purchases and oil prices remained relatively stable, prices temporarily tightened. Approximately 1,000 bags of Tianjin Jinyuan soybeans were initially offered at $35.50, and later at $35.70. Over 100 bags of Qingdao soybeans were offered at $34.00. 350 bags of Jiujiang late soybeans were offered at $35.50.</p>
<p>There was considerable activity in miscellaneous grains yesterday. 200 bags of soybeans were imported from Tianjin. 295 bags of soybeans, 4,740 pieces of soybean cake, and 1,422 cans of raw oil were exported to Xiamen. 575 bags of sesame seeds were exported to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Sugar Prices Fluctuate Slightly</h3>
<p>The sugar market was relatively stable yesterday, with only minor fluctuations. The association's price quotations for spot sugar were: No. 24 coarse white sugar, in-warehouse, $72.60 per bag; out-of-warehouse, $72.00 to $71.90, up 10-20 cents. Dutch cotton white BW mark was still at $71.00. Spot Dutch red sugar was at $55.70, down 20 cents. Taikoo vehicle white B mark, December 5th delivery, was at $75.30; in-warehouse, $74.80, up 20 cents. DY mark, mid-warehouse, was at $68.30; HX mark, $68.10, both up 10 cents.</p>
<p>The following is a survey of Dutch sugar inventories as of the end of last week.</p>
<h3>Coal: Price of Hongji Coal Dust Rises After Large Shipments of Vietnamese Coal Arrive</h3>
<p>Large shipments of Vietnamese coal have arrived in Shanghai. The French vessel Qujiang arrived on Sunday, transporting 8,500 tons of coal from Haiphong. The Siamese vessel, which arrived in Shanghai at around 3 PM yesterday, also carried 8,000 tons of coal from Haiphong. The vessels are currently docked at buoy No. 90 for unloading.</p>
<p>Hongji white coal dust has arrived with 7,000 tons of new stock, delivered by the French vessel Anadi. However, due to the high freight rates and increased insurance costs, the cost has naturally increased. Dealers of white coal dust are asking $155 per ton, more than $21 higher than previous prices. As a result, coal briquette factories have also raised their prices, temporarily adding $12 to the factory price, which is still insufficient to cover the cost of the new coal dust. Therefore, the industry hopes that freight rates will fall, and coal prices will naturally decrease.</p>
<h3>Metals: Huishi Iron Surges, Sales Suffer</h3>
<p>Huishi iron transactions have been sluggish due to high prices. Demand from northern merchants in Tianjin, Yantai, Qingdao, and other areas has been intermittent and has not been shipped in large quantities. Demand is not what it used to be. Although canneries, thermos bottle factories, printing plants, cigarette companies, and biscuit factories in the local market occasionally make small purchases, the quantity is not large. Only 300-400 boxes were sold yesterday and the market is not very active. Standard market prices are rising due to high overseas prices. Yesterday, old steel factories sold at $180 and new steel factories at $170.</p>
<h3>Dried Goods: Miscellaneous Jujubes Continue to Weaken</h3>
<p>The miscellaneous jujube market remains sluggish and continues to weaken. Yesterday, Fu jujubes opened at $34 and Chang jujubes at $25, both down 2 yuan. Over 100 bags were traded. Market prices for Fu jujubes were $36 and Chang jujubes $27. It is reported that even though production prices are low, it is difficult to break even when transporting.</p>
<h3>Tong'an Dried Longans: First Batch Suffers Losses</h3>
<p>The first batch of Tong'an sun-dried longans, consisting of only eight boxes, has arrived. Due to reports of a large number of Hainan longans arriving, market prices have fallen by 30-40 yuan. As the desired price could not be obtained, each dan will suffer tens of yuan in losses.</p>
<h3>Medicinal Materials: Rhubarb Rises $20-$30</h3>
<p>Rhubarb, produced in Sichuan, is a product for reducing fever and promoting bowel movements. Recent deliveries have been scarce, so market prices have been steadily rising. It is reported that the price rose by $20 earlier this month and has risen by another $20-$30 recently. The market price is now close to $900.</p>
<h3>Seafood: New Sea Shrimp Roe is Sold</h3>
<p>New sea shrimp roe, harvested this autumn, has not been seen until recently. Over ten boxes of medium-grade shrimp roe were recently shipped from Weihai. The quality is excellent and they were immediately sold for $150.</p>
<h3>Paper Prices: Native Paper Expensive</h3>
<p>Native paper from eastern Zhejiang transported to Shanghai consists mainly of grass paper and screen paper. Grass paper is produced in Fuyang, Tonglu, Quzhou, and the Ningbo-Shaoxing area, while screen paper is produced in Xiaoshan, Shangyu, Zhuji, and Xincang. Their uses are well known. Screen paper is used by people in Jiangsu, Anhui, Shandong, Hebei, and Shanxi to replace paper for burning, but it can also be used as practice calligraphy paper, so sales are also very strong. Before the Zhejiang coastal blockade on "January 5th," the amount of these two types of native paper transported from Ningbo to Shanghai was very large, so the price increase compared to the second half of last year was still slight. Grass paper sells for two yuan and eighty cents to three yuan and fifty cents per bundle in national currency. High-quality sanitary grass paper sells for six yuan and twenty cents to seven yuan and fifty cents per large bundle (note). Screen paper sells for twelve yuan and fifty cents to fourteen yuan and fifty cents per piece. However, after the Zhejiang coastal blockade, arrivals in Shanghai have almost disappeared, but because sales are still very strong, the stock in the market is gradually being exhausted. In addition, paper merchants hoard and speculate, making it impossible to purchase whole batches from the market for transportation to other areas. Therefore, paper prices are soaring. As of now, coarse grass paper sells for eight yuan and fifty cents to ten yuan and five cents per bundle. High-quality sanitary grass paper has risen even more, to twenty-four yuan to twenty-six yuan per bundle, an increase of one to two and a half times compared to before the blockade. Screen paper sells for twenty-eight yuan to thirty-two yuan per piece, but better quality "Xiaoshan Wang Xiaoji Screen Tip" and "Shangyu Screen," etc., are almost nowhere to be found in the market. Paper merchants mostly use inferior "local mountain eight 'tip'" paper to meet demand. (Note: One large bundle of sanitary grass paper is equivalent to three small bundles of coarse grass paper in terms of quantity). (Yan)</p>

<h3>Overview of Five Major Cultural Undertakings of the Catholic Church in China</h3>
<p>(1) Xujiahui Library</p>
<p>Xujiahui in Shanghai is the site of the tomb of Xu Wending, a former Ming dynasty chancellor. Many of his descendants have also lived there for generations. It is also located at the confluence of the Zhaojiabang and Fahuajing rivers, hence the name Xujiahui. Tracing back to the beginning of the Jesuit mission in China, they immediately focused on cultural undertakings. Later, due to suppression, the Jesuit presence in China was interrupted. It was not until the 22nd year of Daoguang (1842) that they returned, preaching in Jiangnan, and cultural undertakings were revived. In the 27th year of Daoguang (1847), Jesuits moved from Hengtang in Qingpu to Xujiahui to establish a permanent residence. The prototype of the library was likely formed at this time, as the Jesuits, focused on culture, inevitably relied on books.</p>
<p>Initially, the library was housed in simple buildings, just three rooms. In the 10th year of Xianfeng (1860), the site was expanded, moving Zhaojiabang to the east and adding a four-story building to serve as a residence for the Jesuits. The library then had its own location. As the collection grew, the original library became insufficient. In the 23rd year of Guangxu (1897), another building was constructed in the eastern corner of the residence, with a total of twelve rooms over two floors. Western books were stored on the upper floor, and Chinese books on the lower floor. (Moved in the 32nd year of Guangxu [1906] and remains so today).</p>
<p>The founder of the library was Father Gotteland, a French priest who arrived in Shanghai in the 22nd year of Daoguang. However, the individuals who truly expanded this library and laid its foundation were Fathers P. Zottoli and P. Havret. Both Chao and Xia were famous sinologists and prolific writers who made significant contributions to bridging Chinese and Western cultures.</p>
<p>However, those who assisted the two fathers in developing this great undertaking were Ma Xiangbo and Li Jianyu, both outstanding students of Father Chao. Ma Xiangbo is well known and needs no further praise, but his library work is little known outside the Church. Li was a native of Nanhui, Jiangsu, born in the 20th year of Daoguang (1840). He founded the Yiwunlu, Huibao, and Shengxinbao, becoming a pioneer in the newspaper industry. He also authored many books on religion and philosophy. He passed away in the first year of the Republic (1912). Those who managed the library under Ma and Li included Shen Jinbiao (1845-1929), Xu Li (1851-1932), Mao Benquan (still living), Xu Yunxi (died in February of this year), Zhang Ruoyu (1869-1929), Zhang Yushan (1872-1929), and Yang Weishi, among others. Since the 12th year of the Republic, both Chinese and Western clergy have been in charge of the Chinese and Western collections. The current head is Father Cui Tingcai, a French priest who has been in China for 47 years and is also a renowned sinologist.</p>
<p>The purpose of the Xujiahui Library is to assist clergy in academic research, and the clergy's academic research aims to promote Chinese culture. Therefore, it does not emphasize empty theories. As a result, its collection prioritizes history and geography. The most valuable historical and geographical books are local gazetteers from various provinces. The Xujiahui Library has acquired 2,531 types of local gazetteers over the years. The provincial breakdown is as follows: Hebei, 264; Liaoning, 64; Jilin, 9; Heilongjiang, 16; Shandong, 253; Gansu, 71; Xinjiang, 13; Henan, 274; Shanxi, 181; Jiangsu, 235; Anhui, 105; Jiangxi, 118; Sichuan, 207; Guangdong, 116; Fujian, 80; Zhejiang, 181; Hubei, 115; Hunan, 89; Shaanxi, 140; Guangxi, 61; Yunnan, 96; Guizhou, 44. Several points should be noted regarding local gazetteers: (1) Over 400 types of general geography, local customs, towns, mountains, rivers, and temple gazetteers are not included in this count. (2) According to a survey of local gazetteers held in libraries nationwide by Mr. Zhu Shijia over a decade ago, the library has 98 unique copies and is particularly rich in late Ming and early Qing printings. However, many rare books have been collected in the last ten years. The most precious is the five-volume manuscript of the Zhishun Zhenjiang Gazetteer. The cover has the inscription "Jiaoshan Han Yin An Book Collection," and inside there are the words "Objects collected by Ruan's Langhuan Mountain Hall." The end of the fifth volume has the words "Dantu Wang Yuyi Ruan Heng Collated Characters," "Yuan Zhao Re-collated Xingfu Temple Attic," "He Yuanxi Corrected Several Places," etc. The cover of the first volume has the three words "Unfinished Draft." Inside, there are densely pasted corrections and typesetting formats, which are likely the draft of the Zhishun Zhenjiang Gazetteer. Ruan Heng, courtesy name Meishu, was the first on the secondary list in the 23rd year of Jiaqing. (3) Genealogies can supplement the inadequacies of local gazetteers. The library has also recently acquired about 200 genealogies. In addition to local gazetteers and genealogies, the library also houses Buddhist scriptures and Daoist canons, such as the major collections of scriptures from the Japanese Hongkyo Shoin, the Japanese Sutra Repository, and the Taisho Shinshu Daizokyo, as well as Buddhist texts printed in China. The library also values series. The "First Collection of Heavenly Learning," the only Catholic series in China, also contains all the writings of Western scholars from the late Ming and Qing dynasties, with over 100 types, including printed editions, manuscripts, and photocopies, making it one of the richest collections in the world. Newspapers and magazines are also related to history, so the library tries to preserve complete sets. For example, Shenbao's first issue to this day is a complete set. Even important historical materials of the Kuomintang are preserved in part. Other ordinary books and series are difficult to list. Catholic books are also the most collected in the country. In the future, with some reorganization, a Catholic scripture collection can be compiled and printed.</p>

<h3>International Cup Football Tournament, China Encounters England</h3>
<p>Curtain to Rise on December 14</p>
<p>The International Cup football tournament will open on December 14. The order for the first week includes a total of three clashes. China meets England. Although China's lineup this year has lost Xu Wenkui and Cao Qiuting, it is still very strong. England, however, has weakened due to the withdrawal of Cambodia, so China is expected to steadily secure a spot in the semi-finals. The other two games are the World Team vs. Portugal and the Russian Team vs. the Jewish Team. The French team is idle. The World Team is organized by Saint Francis's famous striker Fuen and others. The Russian team has many famous players scattered among various A-League teams, such as Beixitong's Tievoni, Cairo, Nogulov, Saint Francis's Sicalo Lequ, the French firm's Robert Stov, Lax's Kapustin, and Xibu's Zhuolun Zefu, all of whom are the best of their time.</p>
<h3>Paramount vs. Xiqing Giant: Basketball Friendly Match Yesterday, 48-43, Giant Wins Narrowly</h3>
<p>The 13th Xiqing Basketball Tournament is scheduled to begin on the 9th of next month. Strong teams from China and abroad are actively preparing. The defending champion, Paramount, and the Xiqing Giant team played a preliminary match at the Xiqing Gymnasium last night to test each other's strengths. However, neither team fielded their true starting lineups, and the game was played very politely. Mr. Bratov, the Xiqing Sports Director, also provided instructions throughout. Li Zhenzhong, the main player for Paramount, did not play yesterday. The Giants had the advantage of playing on their home court. Therefore, the Giants led 26-20 in the first half by six points. In the second half, Paramount made a slight counterattack and led 23-22. The final result was a narrow victory for the Giants, 48-43.</p>

<h3>The Story of the Parrot</h3>
<p>— Xu Yi</p>
<p>"Ah Wang is stealing flowers, Ah Wang is stealing flowers!" The crisp sound came from the courtyard into the room.</p>
<p>The owner of the room ran out of the doorway and looked into the courtyard. Ah Wang was indeed hiding in the flower bushes, making faces.</p>
<p>"What a clever bird," the owner praised, looking at the parrot hanging under the courtyard pillar.</p>
<p>××××</p>
<p>"Ah Wang is stealing flowers, Ah Wang is stealing flowers!" The crisp sound came from the courtyard into the room.</p>
<p>The owner of the room ran out of the door and looked into the courtyard. Ah Wang was not hiding in the flower bushes, but was cooking in the kitchen.</p>
<p>"What a cunning bird, falsely accusing people," the owner said with a faint smile, looking at the parrot hanging under the courtyard pillar.</p>
<p>××××</p>
<p>"Ah Wang is stealing flowers, Ah Wang is stealing flowers!" It was the same old tune.</p>
<p>The owner of the room ran out of the door and looked into the courtyard. There was no Ah Wang, nor were there any flowers. The flowers had already withered, and Ah Wang had long since stopped its business.</p>
<p>"..." The owner said nothing; he felt bored.</p>
<p>××××</p>
<p>"Ah Wang is stealing flowers, Ah Wang is stealing flowers!" Again the old tune.</p>
<p>The owner of the room became angry because it had awakened him from his afternoon nap.</p>
<p>"××," the owner called to his child, "Take the parrot out and feed it to the cat. It's such an annoying bird!"</p>

<h3>Frozen Corpses on the Road</h3>
<p>— Zhang Hong</p>
<p>Friends! Don't cover your noses. I guarantee there won't be a single trace of odor.</p>
<p>Why don't you let go? Don't you believe me? Well, let me tell you.</p>
<p>Just last night, only nine hours ago, isn't that short? The time it takes you to play twenty rounds of mahjong. He, or rather it should be "she," still had blood, still had breath, the heart was still beating. If you still don't believe me, ask the shop assistants at the cigarette shop; they all saw it.</p>
<p>You should remember that the north wind was very strong last night. When you walked out of the heated dance hall and got into your car, you probably shivered.</p>
<p>Right at the entrance of this sauce shop, yes! It's right by that stone boundary marker, you guessed it perfectly. He was squatting there.</p>
<p>His eyes seemed to be covered with a film, looking like a layer of white membrane from a distance. Thick yellow mucus drooped down to his mouth, almost flowing over his lips; if he weren't still trembling, who would dare say this was a living person?</p>
<p>Of course! If it were you, you would have turned your head, closed your eyes, covered your nose with a fragrant handkerchief, and that would be it! But, you haven't forgotten my incorrigible habit of curiosity, have you? I completely forgot that I had something else to do and just...</p>
<p>I watched quietly, he trembled quietly, for almost ten minutes.</p>
<p>Probably, in addition to the cold, he suddenly thought of hunger! He stretched out such a frightening hand, a hand that even I found hard to believe: you? Don't even mention seeing it; you probably haven't even thought of it. Ah! You compare it to the slender waists of women, good! A wonderful comparison! But, friend, would you be willing to take your hand out of your coat pocket and embrace it?</p>
<p>Right; let's continue! Feeling around, he found a small tin can and then felt a pair of chopsticks inside the can. Of course, his expression wasn't as leisurely as you gentlemen eating fancy meals; however, at that moment, the joy he got from the food wasn't something you could enjoy.</p>
<p>This joy didn't last long. His eyes, devoid of awareness, and the hand, as slender as a woman's waist, found almost nothing in the can. One chopstick was inside the can, the other was outside, trying to scoop something up. The consequences need no explanation. With a more violent tremor, the tin can rolled to the edge of the sidewalk. Perhaps this was the only time in his life he was separated from the tin can, which was like his only life.</p>
<p>Even he could understand that he probably wouldn't make it through tonight. I thought I could wait and watch him roll over like the tin can, but I failed! I waited until 8:30, and he was still squatting there, trembling. Disappointed, I had to give up my curiosity.</p>
<p>When exactly did he give up on his life? That's hard to say. Oh yes! Who would calculate the time and write an obituary for him? In short, it was at most nine hours, and there definitely wouldn't be any odor, I guarantee it. Now, I think you can put down your handkerchief.</p>
<p>Hawthorne's Investigation</p>
<h3>The Dancer's Fate</h3>
<p>— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter Twelve: Report and Explanation</p>
<p>Song Quan began to say: "Hesheng and I were ordered by Detective Ni in the morning to go to Qingpu Road. We guarded for more than five hours, and there was no activity in that number seventeen house, and no one went in or out. It wasn't until three o'clock in the afternoon that we saw the old man come out, and I followed him. Hesheng stayed there."</p>
<p>"The old man hired a rickshaw and went straight to the Yuanchang Jewelry Shop on Baoxing Road and went inside. I waited outside for a long time—almost half an hour. At this time, there were two people loitering in front of the jewelry shop, one wearing a gray thin flannel robe and the other wearing a gaudy Western suit. I didn't know what the purpose of these two people was. After a while, the old man came out of the jewelry store. The two people outside pretended to walk away. The old man didn't take the rickshaw anymore and walked east. He seemed to be looking for something, asking the passersby several times. I followed the old man and looked back, seeing that the two suspicious people were still following him from a distance. Although I suspected the actions of these two people, I couldn't interfere with them."</p>
<p>"The old man walked to a small alley near the intersection of Baoxing Road and suddenly flashed into it. I hurried forward and saw him taking out a small white package and throwing it into the trash can at the entrance of the alley. I hurriedly avoided it, letting the old man come out of the alley again. After he left the alley, I also quickly flashed into the alley, picked up the small package from the trash can, opened it, and saw that it was a knife wrapped in a white handkerchief."</p>
<p>Sang suddenly leaned up and raised his right hand. "Brother Jinshou, has the knife been handed over to you? Can you let me take a look?"</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou responded, "Yes, I was just about to tell you that the knife Song Quan brought back could match Li Zhifan's ideal for committing the crime. But I was a bit confused at the time." As he spoke, he opened the drawer in front of him and handed the white-wrapped package to Hawthorne.</p>
<p>Hawthorne unfolded the white handkerchief, revealing a cheap, pointed fruit knife inside. I saw that the blade of the knife was about four or five inches long, and the handle was made of wood and was somewhat oval in shape. This knife could be bought anywhere for only a few cents. I looked at the blade of the knife and didn't see any bloodstains, but there were many bloodstains on the white handkerchief that wrapped it, and there was also a lot of mud on the handkerchief.

<h3>Tears</h3>
<p>— Pinpin</p>
<p>I once read a story about a princess who was blind. A prince who was engaged to her since childhood discovered this defect and asked a sorcerer to cure her. The sorcerer told the prince to say the most loving words to her. The princess was heartbroken and shed tears, and her eyes regained their sight. Tears are precious; they can bring happiness after a long period of pain and heat.</p>
<p>Your family is ruined, your property is lost, you should shed tears; but remember: who gave you the misfortune and loss? You should grit your teeth, ignite a fire of anger, and demand compensation from him. Holding grudges alone and just waiting will not do! Not the crying of a daughter, but the tears of a hero, do you understand!</p>
<p>Our tears are not shed in vain. We must let our tears awaken our hatred and use iron-winged strength to regain our glory and happiness. If you have tears, shed them now, brave and combative people!</p>
<p>Tears also have a value: they are a symbol of awakening.</p>
<p>Dear friend, have you shed tears because of pain? If you have, heaven will bless you, and you will soon gain happiness.</p>
<p>Crying all day long is, of course, harmful and ridiculous. When shedding tears, don't sigh. Only cowards sigh. So what should you do? You should shed tears when you should, and clench your teeth and fists at the same time.</p>
<p>The French poet Lamartine said: "A person is like a tree, shaking it to make it drop its fruit. If it doesn't shed tears, that person will never be touched." We are here, how you are you know, you will feel hatred and shed a few tears involuntarily; like glittering tears indicate you have a clear heart. Under the lair of sin, those who are numb and are not a bit moved to the point of tearing, actually instead burst out of the dirty smile, this person must be comatose! There are so many comatose people that it is frightening! Friends, quickly hate these dreaming corpses with absurd smiles! We are living the life of slaves, only grief and anger, suddenly wake up!</p>
<p>Tears are the blood of the soul, as worthy of cherishing as the blood of the body.</p>
<h3>Fantasy</h3>
<p>— Gongli</p>
<p>Fantasy is a stimulant. It can make people successful, it can make people happy, but it can also make people crazy. So you should remember: "We must be the masters of fantasy, never the slaves of fantasy!"</p>

<h3>Garbo's Romantic Interests</h3>
<p>— Sha Wei</p>
<p>Five times unsuccessful in marriage, still considering her passionate relationship with Heshell.</p>
<p>Since Greta Garbo and Gayelord Hauser returned from their trip to Mount Mist, their romance has been the topic of conversation among every Hollywood gossip. The first phone call she received in the MGM dressing room was from Hauser; at the same time, Garbo, exceptionally, allowed Hauser to freely enter and exit the set while she was working, which shows how intense the relationship between the two has become. By the time this article is published, perhaps Garbo, known for her mystery, has become Mrs. Hauser, but this matter is always a bit doubtful; will Garbo really marry him?</p>
<p>Here, let's recall Garbo's history of romance. She has had five romances, but none of them have resulted in marriage. The first was the famous director Mauritz Stiller, who brought her into the film industry; the second was her on-screen lover John Gilbert; in 1934, George Brent became her third lover; in 1937, Garbo and the great musician Leopold Stokowski also developed a close friendship; so Hauser is her fifth romantic interest.</p>
<p>Now, a big question arises: will Hauser be victorious? The others have all had deep contact with Garbo, and there has been love between her and them, but the second step of marriage has never been carried out. Why is this? The main reason is clearly that Garbo has developed a fear of marriage. In the two steps of romance and union, she has only chosen the former and abandoned union. So, if we want to predict the outcome of this romance, if she still holds on to her fear, then she will not only not marry him, but she may never marry anyone.</p>
<p>Garbo's periods of romance with them can be said to be very short, and this is not because Garbo is fickle, but because she is too cautious: she is suspicious of every ordinary person, and she only trusts the few close friends she usually comes into contact with.</p>
<p>From this point of view, Garbo is really lacking in natural ability, that is, she is congenitally deficient. In her constitution, rest and quiet have become absolute necessities. When she is in love, her love is extremely single-minded. Like other women, she fulfills this obligation of love and naturally hopes for reward, which is not only simple love, but also a large amount of "strength" to help her own lack; she often hesitates about the amount of "strength" on the other side, and also clearly understands that this "hesitation" will hinder her own happiness, therefore she eliminates it.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Garbo's congenital deficiency makes her fearful of everyone. Although she has love, she does not fully reveal it; Garbo believes that "marriage" is a sacred and unavoidable major event, and her character is always high and lonely, so the results of several romances have all become bubbles. She feels that it is more meaningful to dedicate her body and mind entirely to her career.</p>
<p>We can conclude that if Garbo marries, then her partner must meet her ideal standards, so whether she will be Mrs. Hauser in the future is still a question.</p>
<h3>Talking about Dialect Drama</h3>
<p>— Fisherman</p>
<p>These days, dialect drama is being discussed very enthusiastically in the theater world. In fact, this is not a new invention today. Before August 13th, plays using Shanghai dialect were often performed in factories or schools. The application of dialect drama is often suitable for specific areas, such as performing worker plays in factories in Pudong. The audience is mostly from Pudong. Performing plays in Mandarin sometimes makes it difficult for them to understand; while performing in Pudong dialect can make them accept it. After the outbreak of the war, "going to the countryside to perform plays" attracted the attention of artists, and most of the rural plays were performed using local dialects. Those mobile performance troupes also trained villagers everywhere to perform dialect dramas themselves. These actions were nothing more than to achieve the goals of propaganda and education more urgently. However, dialect dramas are rarely performed in formal theaters. This time, the Huaguang Theater first performed "Twilight" (a persecuted adaptation) in Shanghai dialect at the Xuan Palace, and the Shanghai Drama Art Society's "Under the Shanghai Roof" was the earliest to perform multi-act dramas in Shanghai dialect. This is still an attempt. It is said that the Drama Art Society invited a dialect drama expert to rewrite all the lines of "Under the Shanghai Eaves" into Shanghai dialect in advance, and also invited many actors who were good at speaking Shanghai dialect to participate in the performance. The content of this play originally pierced through Shanghai life, and now performing it in Shanghai dialect will definitely make people feel more cordial.</p>
