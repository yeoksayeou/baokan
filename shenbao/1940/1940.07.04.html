<p>社評</p>
<h3>美國立國精神與國際現局</h3>
<p>今天是美國獨立紀念日，也就是北美十三州頒布獨立宣言的日子。當時那十三州殖民地的人民，爲了反抗非法壓制和榨取，不惜在極端艱窘貧困之中，開始了爭取自由獨立的革命戰爭；賴有華盛頓及諸革命領袖的英毅堅決，外交運用的活潑有力，終於以五年苦戰奠定勝利基礎，在篳路藍縷之中建立了第一個民主共和國家，開始了近代史的新頁。這一慕壯烈偉劇，距今雖已整整的一百六十五年，却至今還是抗戰建國的無上模楷，初不以歲月悠久而形减色。抑美國革命的貢獻，不僅誕生了北美合衆國這一點；就世界的意義來講：那亦無異於人權的警鐘，啓蒙的號誌；使新舊世界的人民都領悟了自由獨立的無比價値，因而不惜相繼付出血肉代價以改造自身的命運。而美國及其國人，也正因爲自己曾經歷過那樣艱苦奮鬥的途程，所以更能體會自由獨立的意義和可貴，是以舉凡爲了實現這一原則而從事的爭鬥，無不從美國那裏得到充分的同情和鼓勵，即在中國，亦復深受其惠。這是在北美獨立紀念的今日，人們所應向美國及其人民致其敬意的。</p>
<p>不幸這一現實世界的演變，並不盡能與進化原則相符合。近十餘年來，世運未趨光明，反而日即黑暗；幾乎要把整個世界逆轉到美國革命前的時代。到最近，歐洲全部既已淪入戰爭慘禍中，而遠東的侵略暴行更復有加無已，除使中國慘遭荼毒而外，且更向赤道地帶蔓延，在西太平洋和印度洋引起漫天風暴。在這茫茫宇宙中間，只有西半球還保持一片乾凈土，但也不能免於侵略暗影的侵襲。由美國獨立而普遍建立於世界的基本信念，現已遭受空前摧殘，有的地方是暴力的征服統馭着一切，有的地方是奴役和屈辱代替了獨立和自由，而現代文明與民主政治也都逢到空前嚴重試騐。這是近代史中稀有的變局，同時也就是更加重了具有優良政治傳統和偉大國家潛力的美國的責任</p>
<p>在十年以來的國際變局當中，美國曾有其不磨的貢獻，例如不承認武力變更領土原則的樹立，對於侵略暴舉的指斥和譴責，關於亞歐事變的種種呼籲和措施，都是値得稱頌的賢明舉動，所惜只是其實際功效却渺不可見。且時至今日，情勢已益加艱危和複雜：一方面，即在美當局，亦已承認一切均非空言與抗議所能奏效；另一方面，危機又是來自歐亞雙方，其緩急輕重之間亦復煞費攷慮。如果不能見微知著，當機立斷，則未必不貽誤事機，重蹈十年來一再失敗的覆轍。而侵略者之所以敢於無所畏憚，肆行燃放野火也，未必不是看到美國內部政見龐雜，大選又復屆臨等等弱點，故急著先鞭以謀一逞。日來美艦隊重返太平洋，這是遠東危局中的一服鎭靜劑，但以言消弭危機則顯尚不足。美國朝野至今都在力謀避免戰禍之波及，而在空言抗議與戰爭之間還有相當距離，也儘還有若干有效措施可資援用，有如在遠東方面最賢明的措置當無過於加緊對中國的合作並運用其經濟偉力，這無論從道義上從利害上看，都不應再事躊躇。至於大西洋與太平洋危機孰重，誠不易驟下斷語；但歐洲情况複雜，遠東則遠爲單純；歐洲的德義其勢方張，遠東的侵略者則已屆再衰三竭之候；歐局前途發展尚在未定之天，遠東危脅則已着着逼緊，再不能姑息容忍。如果再徘徊瞻望以致將來不能不同時應付兩面的侵襲，何若先從更急迫更易與的方面下手，速使太平洋風波歸於平靖。</p>
<p>美國不乏明達之士，在這樣一個嚴重關頭，實不應再斤斤於私人政見與血錢利潤的保持。一百六十五年前美國曾以獨立運動爲世界樹立民主政治的先聲，則二十世紀的今日，美國應是擁護自由獨立最有力的堡壘。除非立即以美國的雄厚潛力從事積極措置，使此瀰漫世界的慘禍和罪惡歸於消弭，則因美國獨立而廣被於全球的政治信念必不免更趨凋殘，甚至在新大陸能吾長此保持亦將成爲疑問。在慶祝美國獨立紀念之餘，謹以此意質之美國朝野人士。</p>

<p>新戰爭之序幕、爲大隊德國空軍於六月三日在巴黎之四周飛機塲及製造飛機工業之中心、舉行猛烈攻擊、决日由德陸軍總司令奴羅傑區上將統率有三軍團已準備就緒分別歸隆斯台德·波克及·李勃三中將領帶、德軍攻擊之目標、爲突破法國北部之陣綫、將陸軍推向西南及東南方面退却而殲滅之、當波克中將所統率軍團中之各師列陣準備向桑姆河下游及阿伊士愛司尼運河對岸攻擊之時、發現敵人已準備防守該區、法軍司令決以所有可資調遣之軍隊、澈底防守「魏剛帶」及瑪奇諾防綫、法軍曾經策畫一種新防禦法、以阻止德軍前進摩托化軍隊驚人之迅速突破、經過四日之惡戰、克魯奇中將李奇諾中將及施脫勞新將軍之步兵及鐵甲師、終於突破敵軍防綫、六月九月德軍向賽恩河下游及向巴黎之追擊已在竭力進行中、同日霍資將軍統率之飛快軍隊、已抵達盧歇、並包圍策浦及聖浮勒理沿岸之大隊敵軍、於是敵人之西翼乃被摧毀而戰綫之西側始告安定、德國空軍之集團攻擊爲該區陸軍勝利之主因、在賽恩河流域、德轟炸機之進攻使預備反攻之敵軍步兵師及鐵甲車隊因而分散、德空軍復將鐵道炸斷及鐵道材料毀壞、使敵軍後備隊不能調至前綫、當敵軍開始在勒哈佛瑟堡及勃萊斯登輪之時、空軍卽對上述各港之海港設備蓄油櫃及船舶加以攻擊、隆斯台德中將之軍團、向貢比臬及末斯河西岸之攻擊、爲六月九日陸上總攻之開始、在該區大戰開始之時、魏奇中將李新將中將及勃奇中將所統率之步兵師團、突破愛新尼之陣地、使大隊之摩托化隊伍得順利通過、該區之陸上軍隊大得德空軍之協助、六月十一日克伊新特及萬勒速兩將軍之鐵甲車師及摩托化步兵師已在夏培區準備向特羅伊司及聖第西亞以外之目的地進攻、在二十五年中、德軍第三次渡過馬爾恩河、經過數度惡戰之後、德軍摩托化隊伍在東南方瑞士邊境處突破敵軍防錢、大批步兵師及摩托化隊伍在一狹小區域中之能互相呼應、實爲德軍最高司令之傑作、此時德國軍隊已佔據賽恩河下游、並突破保護巴黎之陣地、敵軍之西翼至是亦停止抵抗、六月十四日顧區勒將軍之軍隊開入巴黎、北綫之敵軍、在德軍追擊下完全潰敗、十四日李柏中將之軍團參加作戰、對敵軍最堅强之砲台施行猛攻、二日之後、由大批砲隊之協助、獲索巴將軍之軍隊突破牢不可破之瑪奇諾防綫、於是敵軍之東南北綫因背後感受威嚇、再分裂爲二部、敵軍抵抗之希望、乃宜告消滅、十五日杜爾曼將軍之軍隊、在柯爾馬附近佔據、萊茵河上游之砲壘地帶、並突破伏斯奇山、德空軍與陸軍之密切合作、使在薩爾白魯根南方及柯爾瑪以及梅好仙等處對瑪奇諾防錢之包圍得以迅速完成、轟炸機與戰鬥機之低飛攻擊、異常得力、高射砲隊協助步兵之前進收效亦大、同時空軍協助步兵向比珊康前進直至瑞士邊境、六月十五日後由海岸至末斯河之追擊規模最大、巴黎失後、在德軍全綫向南及西南進擊與空軍轟炸下法軍潰竄而逃、此項陸空雙方亡命之追擊、使敵軍無法在羅伊亞河之對岸集中其軍隊、德軍推進之威力、雖則世界大戰時法國抵抗之象徵凡爾登堡壘、亦無法支持終於十五日被攻陷、十七日德軍抵達比珊康西南之法瑞邊境、於是將亞爾薩斯勞倫區及瑪奇諾防綫之法軍加以包圍、越過羅伊亞河敵軍巳無抵抗能力、法軍已失其戰鬥力、乃放下其武器、在此種局面之下、法總理貝當元帥乃向德國政府請其提出停戰條件、六月二十一日在元首及德軍總司令之前、一九一八年之恥辱、乃在貢比臬森林之歷史上原址完全洗淸、法國代表團接受德軍總司令之停戰條件後、於二于二日下午六時五于分簽字、二十五日上午一時三十五分德義軍隊停止對法作戰、經六星期之空前劇戰、宣告終止、德軍大勝、第二期戰事之成功、空軍之建樹獨多、戈林將軍之領導得法、空軍將十之戮力効命、均爲致勝之原因、防空方面、由格勞特·克勒魏斯各將領之指揮得宜、顯示百戰百勝之精神、陸軍在空軍之掩護下、不惜犧牲、爭取陣地、斬將搴旗、追奔逐北、海軍自佔領荷比法海岸後、已有新任務、卽將海港改爲根據地、德國軍備方面之成就、亦使舉世震驚、各國人士咸以德軍何以能於此短時期中、獲致如此奇功爲問、須知德國勝利之原因、卽敵人所以爲德國之弱點、易言之、卽第三德意志之革命、與國社主義之領袖是也、此兩者產生近代戰最良好之武器、以及最高統帥、統一陸海空軍之指揮、增加官兵作戰之効率、而造成德國歷史上最光榮之一頁、在六月五日至二十五日當中、德國軍團司令史貝克將軍爲國捐軀、陸海空三軍官兵陣亡者共一六·八二二人、失踪者共九·九二一人、負傷者六八·五一一人、以國家立塲而論、德國戰勝法國、其傷亡人數、可謂極少、然對於個人、固爲至可惋惜者、總計自五月十日起直至停戰協定、德國官兵共計、</p>
<p>此與世界大戰比較、可謂微乎其微、一九一四年德軍在西綫損失六三八·〇〇〇人其中陣亡者達八五·〇〇〇人、一九一六年攻凡爾登損失三一〇·〇〇〇人、其中四一·〇〇〇人陣亡、索姆之役、損失四一七·〇〇〇人其中陣亡者達五八·〇〇〇人、一九一八年四月法國大戰德軍損失二四〇·〇〇〇人（陣亡三五·〇〇〇人）、與今年使法國屈服之戰役比較、其傷亡之統計、豈可以道里計耶、此在法國方面、其損失若干雖不可知、但被俘者則達一·九〇〇·〇〇〇人、其中有軍團總指揮五人、軍官約二九·〇〇〇人其海軍損失、亦復龐大無比（見另電）、何况敵軍於陸海空軍重大損失之外、又復因停戰協定使殘餘法軍不能再參加作戰矣、（三日海通電）</p>
<p>英爲唯一敵人</p>
<p>柏林　德軍司令部所發表之最後報告、其結語略謂、自德軍在西綫擊敗號稱作戰英勇之陸上强國之後、德國之偉大勝利、已使協約國失其存在、今德國之敵人、惟英國而已、（三日海通電）</p>

<h3>羅馬尼亞境內　德國人的勢力</h3>
<p>西布爲羅馬尼亞國新黨運動的堡壘·羅馬尼亞國社黨地方領袖的參謀本部及德國僑民團都在這地方有其總部。所有給脫倫伐尼亞，巴那，蘇末西，及舊羅各地，與比薩拉比亞國社黨區部的命令，也從這地方發出。</p>
<p>雖則這城市的居民，有德國人，羅馬尼亞人，及匈牙利人，但操縱一切的却是德國人，大多數的店舖，皆在德人之手，而德國人也防止別國人設舖於該城地位良好的地帶。</p>
<p>西布的經濟命脈操於德國銀行之手，這些銀行與德國境內的銀行發生密切關係。道些銀行有德國的靑年商人，代替非日耳曼人的地位。街道之上充滿衣服一律的靑年，這些靑年都戴着泰羅爾式的帽，着白色襪，這是蘇台德區國社黨徒在慕尼黑會議前所愛好的服裝</p>
<p>在各街道上，所聽到的大部分是德國方言。人與人碰到，都致德國敬禮。在書舖中所見到的都是工人，書店中央放着每本值六美金的『我的奮鬥』</p>
<p>羅馬尼亞的學生穿着羅國靑年團的制服，但德國兒童則戴他們特殊的帽子，帽子的顏色，與希特勒帽的顏色很相像。如果沒有羅馬尼亞軍人在街上，一個人很易感到是在德國</p>
<p>同時西布的德國人，却相信他們是居住於德國。他們每决聽到德國勝利，都每决欣喜非凡，每决侵略中立國，也表示在喜。西布的德國人，都認爲他們是百分之百的德國人，而國社黨則認爲他們是脫倫伐尼亞的統治者。他們都相信在羅馬尼亞的德國人，不久卽將在德國政府統治之下，而對於此事之發生，已急不能待，他們願意在這些地方去歡迎希特勒，而卽刻升上德國的卍字旗，這種一直到現在，還是不敢公開的。無數的卍字旗，已偷偷地在鄰兵村莊中製造着。</p>
<p>西布是所謂德國改造的中心，這些德國人，在一九三三年前，卽與希特勒來往，而在那年以後，卽公開反對自由主義的屬於互助團的德國人。法布里錫斯是德國羅馬尼亞德國僑民團的領袖，他是上决大戰時奧匈帝國軍隊的大尉，一九一八年以後，變爲家禽業的主人，而同時在西布開始政治活動。</p>
<p>從這地方，有大批年靑人往德國受訓練變爲德國的宣傳家，打破以前在羅馬尼亞德國各領袖的勢力。以前德國少數人民在羅馬尼亞的領袖，從新敎的主敎至文化界領袖，也不得不服從法布里錫斯的領導，他同時指定羅馬尼亞國會代表的人選。目前德國人的代表，用他們領袖的名義，效忠羅馬尼亞政府。法布里錫斯與柏林領袖的關係，非常密切，他曾往德國住了好幾月。</p>
<p>在他離開時國社黨的參謀本部並不停止活動，各地方領袖仍照常來往於他們領導的各區內，而組織工作顯然仍進行。柏拉希洛夫的德國領事每周來往西布兩次，與國社領袖舉行畏時間的談話。</p>
<p>德國人在羅馬尼亞主要的機關報也發行於此。編輯部全體都是可靠的國社黨員</p>
<p>在西布的他國人民很明白國社黨把他們放在「黑名單」上。雖無公開衝突，但國社黨和其他國人民的關係，極爲尖銳。比如在荷蘭，已使人感到德國第五縱隊活動的危險。不過唯一不同之點是在西布及其四周，德國人更其比在洛脫丹有很多人數及良好組織而已。</p>
<p>西布以外，羅馬尼亞的薩脫爾，馬爾城，德國人最近也想把那方的少數民族組織起來。那地方離開匈牙利邊境只有十英里遠，除開羅馬尼亞人及德國人以外，邊有不少的匈牙利人。國社黨竭力想證明這些匈牙利人，是德國人的子孫。</p>
<p>在地方領袖威薩爾指導之下，不斷舉行民族會議，調查人民的祖先問題。這些會議自一四月開始，至五月初才終止。</p>
<p>在一個村莊中，不管敎會的反對，德國人在舉行一次會議，有十二個人逐戶去調查各戶的祖先，在地方領袖的報告中，指出一半居民已不說德語。按照他的意見，這是牧師及敎員之過。在別一鎭市上，牧師不尤利用學校來開會，而當地靑年俱樂部及市政廳也鎖了起來。最後只好一所較小的女修道院中開會。</p>
<p>從國社黨地方領袖的詳細報告中，顯然羅國的國社黨人，在西北區有積極的活動，雖然匈牙利人很反對，他們也多少有了些成就，地方行政當局對於羅國政府尤許其活動，極爲驚異，因羅國政府早有特別命令，只有羅馬尼亞統一陣綫，才准許有政治集，同時這一地帶也是最重要的國防區，實難應許國社黨活動。</p>
<h3>歐洲無綫電播音戰</h3>
<p>英德兩國每大二十四小時中，從數十個廣播無綫電台，用數十種語言，互作空中的宣傳戰。它們的作用，雖則有好有歹，大部份總免小掉刁鑽促狹和惹是生非。德國人利用五十處電台，不斷向英國攻訐，一天到晚沒有一句好話。不是說艾登「只重衣衫，不會講話，」便是嘲笑經濟作戰部長克羅斯是「饑荒部長」。</p>
<p>柏林廣播員傅利特塞，他的拿手傑作在宣傳英國的海軍損失。有時候德國人在空氣中對英人大肆攻擊，然又不知他們的眞意所在。這樣祇不過把英國人弄得發怒而已。譬如德國播音台本來好好的在播着一曲美國歌，聽衆正在顧而樂之，突如其來挿入了播音員的聲音，他說：「今天我們的題目是德國的仇敵，英國的禍根－－邱吉爾！」接下去便把邱吉爾大大的嘲駡一番。</p>
<p>柏林的播昔員各種國籍都有，用各種語　向全世界廣播「消息」。有一個埃及人名叫法考薩的，戰時方起，被德人所俘。德軍對他說，他可以用阿拉伯語言作宣傳廣播，或則被禁在俘虜收容所中。他自然願意担任廣播之職。號稱爲「高貴的印度人」，當他在官傳英國殘忍的殖民政策時，常能發現稀有的普魯士口音。一位不舉姓名的「美國醫士」，據稱，「剛從波蘭而來，」在電台上描摹那里的富庶。被俘的英國兵和空軍——有眞也有假的，常在空中向家鄕人宣傳說，德國的俘虜收容所比了上等旅館還要好呢。一個美國播昔員發覺這所謂「俘虜」的德國人不時出現在電台左近。</p>
<p>無綫電播音戰中最出色的脚色，要算替德國宣傳的哈哈爵士（Lorp　Haw　Haw了。英國人收聽這位音韻沉着，口齒悅耳的貴族化播音員，比了任何外國節目爲高興。倫敦播音界摹仿這個「哈哈」，曾經風靡一時。起初當局不加注意，到現在除了廣播一套「如何聽取德國的宜傳之外，却一籌莫展。哈哈於廣播所謂「消息之外，對於英政府很多挪揄。關於（一）食糧分配，他向英國人說，「這十足代表你們的搶銅錢政府。因之你們的肉食分配拿價錢作爲根據——一星期內的限制爲一先令十辦士，不像德國依據份量來支配。」（二）疏散人口，他說，「你們的政府用何種權力來把你和丈夫分離？你安全地離開市區以後，你可知道你的丈夫現在在做些什麼呢？」他又向工人們說：「英國的工人，你們不必担心，德國元首深知發動這决戰事的是英國的紳十們，而把你到充當砲灰。」通常的工人聽他們這種宣傳心裏非常憤慨，在張伯倫之前，早就要和希特勒一決雌雄呢。</p>
<p>哈哈爵士本是威廉·喬愛士的化名，原係英國政閥莫士萊的部下，脫離之後便自創納粹法西斯蒂黨。旋因經濟上發生問題，便一溜烟跑到德國去。現在他是德國「外籍」播音員中薪給最高的人，每星期大的可收入（美金）六十元。德國的無綫電台劇，常把希特勒治下的承平氣　，從空中廣播出外。從無綫電收音機中，可以聽到亨堡的一個屠戶對他的主顧們的說話，他說各種肉食無不備貨充足，只要說得出名詞來，沒有買不到的哩。德國人似乎不以矛盾爲異。一小時之後，那里好像父有嬰孩的哭聲，和婦人們悲泣，來證明英國的封鎖是不人道的。</p>
<p>不久之前哈哈爵士又上演一個無錢電播音劇，叫做「倫敦的勞合氏」。勞合氏著名的「魯丁鐘」不時鳴着，表示對保險商的一種警告，一條條船在沉沒了。英國人聽到這種作風只好付之一笑。原來這「魯丁鐘」並不是船沉必鳴的，只有在特殊消息發生時才用得着，譬如一條船久無到埠的音訊，忽而知道她的下落所在，於是鳴鐘通知大家。</p>

<h3>駐滬英軍未調動　英遠東政策不變　海防檢查嚴密貨運清淡香港形勢影響本市金融</h3>
<p>據昨日報載、倫敦合衆社電訊稱、英官方表示英國將調動在滬少數防軍、移防香港云云、大中社記者昨特走訪英國方面某官員、叩　眞相、據謂此事旣無倫敦方面之正式命令、自屬未可確信、然「余可斷言者卽英國對遠東政策、一仍舊貫、並無二致也、」又據外人方面消息、本埠英軍官塲方面、昨日對於所傳駐華英軍不久將調至香港之消息、拒絕發表任何批評、僅稱彼等所得之情報、巳全見於報紙中、據外交界消息靈通方面探悉、英大使寇爾爵士、自本星期來、召見該國駐華之軍政僚屬頗多、此外若干英僑之權威者、亦有晋謁、前日（二日）上午、英國駐滬防軍司令西蒙斯少將、亦嘗進謁英大使有所晤談、按西蒙斯少將前因騎馬受傷、現方初愈、</p>
<p>本市金融昨受影響</p>
<p>自香港形勢突趨緊張後、本埠金融方面、因適屆六底比期、銀錢業例假二天、故尚無若何反應、但金融市塲已於昨日開市、昨日淸晨、一般卽預料將有重大變更、其造成此種變史之惟一原因、蓋因一般人均認爲香港局勢確極緊張、此間與自由中國間之貨運、有被截斷之危險、據所獲報告、被阻於香港之貨物、價值在一千萬元上下、除米煤兩項、仍可以較高之價值、自安南採購、其他貨物、則大受限制、是以價格遂高漲、其漲價之原因、則爲一般人均事囤積、以備將來匱乏所需所致、其他貨運、均受軍事上之影饗、據談所有船只、均已被預定云、</p>
<p>安南華人紛紛遷避</p>
<p>泰晤士報稱、據安南海防來滬者談、東京灣方面、日海軍力量大事增加、加緊活動、海南島方面、日軍雲集、數量似亦大增、海關爲戒備起見、對往來旅客一概施以嚴密之檢查、並發出警告、旅客中稍涉嫌疑、卽予逮捕、旅居安南之華人、鑒於安南形勢之緊張、均擬遷地爲良、避往星島、然後避居華南云、</p>
<p>港防貨運突然淸淡</p>
<p>滬港防航綫貨運、受謠言影響、營業突然淸淡、怡和洋行泰生輪準今日離滬、開往香港海防、四川輪改明日（五日）由滬赴厦門、經香港廣州灣海口而至海防、華綸洋行格蘭輪原定今日駛港、因客貨寥寥、現準改赴盤谷、渣華公司芝尼加拿號、今日起程、赴厦門經香港小呂宋回返泗水、港貨不多、乘客尚不少、</p>
<p>英如屈服貽累遠東</p>
<p>英文中國評論報社論指稱、香港與越南當局、巳下令撤退該兩處之婦孺、華南之危機正方興未艾、該刊指責日本覓求藉口、以破壞與香港英當局所訂之協定、並主張任何行動之完全自由、該刊來稱、目下英人苟向日本屈服、則非但英人本身將受致命之打擊、且凡與遠東有利害關係之各國、均將蒙受其害、</p>
<p>日本刋物斥責英國</p>
<p>字林西報七月三日東京特電云、東京報章雜誌、皆以甚顯著地位、刊載關於南洋方面之文字、「都新聞」夕刊以全版刊登緬甸之照片與地圖、而力言緬甸與越南之密切連繫、東京公共大堂頃舉行羣衆大會、多人發表關於南洋之演說、而斥英國爲</p>
<p>日本之敵人、至於香港撤退婦孺事、日人以爲乃香港當局疑慮日方在香港附近之軍事行動、而恐起可能的摩擦所致、一般相信該處緊張情勢、可無意外事件而渡過、日方就緬甸及香港乃重慶接濟路綫事提出交涉、英國駐日大使克萊琪謂英國需要</p>
<p>更多時間加以考慮一節、日人皆感憤懣、而信英國係與美國商議後、英大使始發此言、然日人自信英國將向日方保證戰爭接濟品不復經香港與緬甸運往重慶、</p>
<h3>移交土地局卷宗　俞鴻鈞提抗議　違背協定大碍業主利益</h3>
<p>路透社三日重慶電、前上海市長兪鴻鈞、因聞上海工部局決議將前大上海市政府託該局保管之土地局卷宗、交與傅筱菴、今日已電工部局、提出嚴重抗議、內稱、工部局此舉、實屬違背協定、大碍上海中外業主之利益、故請工部局重行考慮所定之決議、</p>
<p>工部局正式受託於中國政府之土地局卷宗、時至今日、似已不能不造成喪失中外同情之舉、而以之授與未經各國承認之偽方、據日本大使館發言人昨晚在招待新聞記者席上宣稱、工部局總辦費利溥、曾於昨日下午二時半、往日本總領事館訪問三浦、提出擬將土地局卷宗交與日總領事之建議、當由日總領事予以接受、將於明日來辦移交手續、又據昨日英文大美晚報稱、關於工部局移交土地局卷宗問題、將於五日晨舉行、由工部局方面先將卷宗交付日總領三浦、然後由三浦轉與「市府土地局」、據傳筱庵稱、土地局卷宗之「交還」、已爲解決越界築路問題闢一坦途、據云影響越界築路「協定」之施行者、其原因有三、卽「特警隊」問題、租稅及法院問題、土地局卷宗問題是、今工部局已將土地局卷宗交出、將來偽方對案卷管理、不致有何變動、一切均「照常進行」云、</p>

<h3>北河南路　昨日情况</h3>
<p>橫貫各馬路未攔斷　各路電車有恢復訊</p>
<p>日方突於上週末將其去夏所置北江西路中之連綿不斷鐵絲木架完全撤除後、復於前日（二號）開始移其防綫、向西伸展至北河南路東面、並沿該綫南起天后宮橋北堍北迄靶子路德隆烟廠門首、設立崗位六處、更用小型鐵絲木架堵塞北河南路東面之里弄三條、詳情已載昨日本報、當日軍工程隊前日開始佈防之際、對於沿北河南路東西通行之各馬路口、初欲擇其交通較繁之處仍攔置鐵絲木架、已將應用之鐵絲木樁等物運堆其地、迨至昨晨記者特循北河南路視察一週、則該項障碍物之村料俱已搬盡、電車公司現以北區經過電車之馬路、概無鐵絲網之阻碍、爲便利市民與發展交通起見、聞將請求當局向日方交涉恢復從前該區內有軌無軌各路車輛行駛之路綫、刻下日方對於出入其防綫以東地帶旣經免除限制、逆料此點或易解決、至於該區之警權問題、近來似未有何發展、巡捕巡邏僅及北江西路已拆除之鐵絲米架處、今其防綫雖西展數十碼之遙、而巡邏終點並未稍予後退寸步也、</p>
<h3>米糧評價委會　明日成立</h3>

<p>米價</p>
<p>近日以來因香港局勢緊張、滬港航輪濡滯、貢米來源不無影饗、一般米槖竟揚言來源缺乏、無形抬高市價、當局特於前日責令豆米行公會、迅行設法抑低米價、所有米市塲買賣、一律不得超越六月二十九日收盤行市、吾則嚴予懲處、前日市價竟漲二元、現當局甫在澈查中、將予以懲處、米行茶會市塲昨晨七時半照常開做、各貨一律站定原盤、</p>

<h3>六月份生活費指數　米價上漲最劇　投機者利用心理利用局勢　貨幣購買力又减低二分半</h3>
<p>民國二十九年六月份、上海市工人生活費指數及零售物價情形如下、本月一般躉售物價、趨勢下降、外匯亦鬆、而工人生活費指數則仍上升頗劇、本月爲四二二·九一、較上月增四十點、卽百分之十又四五、破五月份三八二·九一之最高、紀錄、分類指數中、以食物類所增爲最烈、五月指數尚爲三八三·二四、六月陡升至四五一·七四、雜項類所增甚微、衣着類有顯著之下降、五月爲四〇三·八五、六月僅三六〇·〇〇、燃料類僅跌百分之二又五九、設六月下半月煤球之價不漲、則所跌當不止此、本月貨幣購買力又减二分有半、爲二角三分六厘五毫、</p>
<p>米價飛漲</p>
<p>六月指數之升、大半由於米價劇漲、頭號粳米、二十日每石達七十四元有半、爲本市前此所未有之高價、六月二號粳米每石平均六十元三角九分、較五月陡漲百分之二十九又四八、二號西貢五十五元九角半、漲百分之十六又七七、上升之理由、（一）靑黃不接之際、米價例必上升、（二）天久不雨、影響秋收、（三）寗紹等地米價昂貴、刺激本市之價格、（四）麵粉產額、因小麥受統制而减低、（五）產區採辦軍用米糧、爲量頗鉅，（六）越南爲米煤來源、因局勢緊張而影饗米價、（七）市民鑒於米價日高、大量囤積、然此時距靑黃不接之時尚遠、且值黃霉雨季、本年於六月十二入霉、七月十五出霉、在六月十四前後、巳卽得雨、十天大雨、廿三迄月杪、雨水尤多、據徐家滙天文台報告、全月竟得雨三寸有半、加以存糧木充、來源未斷、所定越米、爲數甚鉅、更有進者、本月一般躉售市價俱跌、外匯較五月尤長、故米價之漲、就一般物價趨勢而言、實不相符、其所以造成此種嚴重局勢者、不外乎投機者利用心理、利用時局而已、所望一般市民、於價格急　上升之時、自需要而外、勿大量購備、則謠言自息，物價自落、</p>
<p>燃料未跌</p>
<p>至於煤球、本月二十日左右每担又達八元、煤球原料、自五月起、以美金計、上月月初匯價劇縮之時、煤球售價、頃刻上升、本月匯價極鬆、未聞依照比例下跌、本市存煤最充、且來源未斷一、藉曰越南局勢緊張、亦何致立刻上漲乎、總之、食米·煤球·房租三者、對於市民生計、所關至切、三者俱漲、百物無不隨之而騰貴、故欲物價下降、應先抑平此三者之價格、則市民有蘇息之機矣、</p>
<h3>自從用了面麗以後……〇</h3>
<p>— 陳麗娟</p>
<p>面麗面麗。同學們都嚷着這個聽熟了的名字。蘭姊每天早晨終要對着鏡子。塗抹一會。一陣幽靜的面麗的香味。在四週蕩漾着。我陶醉了。雪今天課後特地趕到同仁西藥社去買了一瓶。還來對我炫耀着牠的好處。慧又盛稱面麗的功效。於是打動了我改用面麗的心。初試面麗。但覺粉質細百。潤而不膩。搽在面上。光滑潔白。不必再敷其他的香粉了。况且多數的香粉。含有一種鉛質。祗有損害皮膚。使皮膚枯黃粗糙。所以我自從用了面麗以後。一切的香粉。一切的雪花粉。都屛棄了。面麗的香味。我是知道是一種幽香的花卉。但是蘭姊却說有些像牛乳。面麗怎沒會用牛乳。不見得吧。如果眞的用牛乳。那滋補身體的功效。用來滋養皮膚。不是很好嗎。面麗是否用牛乳。我那裏能够知道。但面麗確有牛乳偉大的功效。我自從用了面麗以後。最顯著的功效。是皮膚起着一種晶瑩的色彩。鮮艷欲滴。像初彩的瓷器。像雨露中的鮮花。一向因爲喜用脂粉的緣故。在曉粧以前。皮膚慘白粗糙。倘使不加一些脂粉•那竟不能見人。現在好了。這種弊病。一些沒有了。而且粗大的毛孔縮小了。所以皮膚細嫩了許多。同時得到雪的報告。她的雀斑。也治好了。欣慰之餘。聊寫着幾句感謝面麗的發明者。</p>

<h3>環境不安　金巿頹然不振</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤告跌雖微、而人心顯然萎靡不振、此乃受種種不安時局發展之影響、至外匯鬆後曾緊、但金價終難帶起、晨初開盤爲五千四百十元、較假前收市低二十元、後尚微起、不意錢兌業銀號帮一致塞出、而銀樓帮亦吐售、最引人注目、經此相當賣風後、挫落至五千三百三十元、後以證券帮錢兌業維持、拉進若干、乃於收盤前提升數十元、結果僅爲五千三百四十五元、較假前軋降八十五元、午後週三無市、半日交易尚旺、的二千兩光景、銀樓飾金終則掛小十元、海關金等仍平、</p>
<p>烚赤跌八十五元</p>

<h3>證劵　內債進出倐忽　外股低落百分之十</h3>
<p>證劵暗盤、經過三日之休假後、昨已照常開市、在此三日間、租界問題之複雜、國際形勢之演變、以及宋子文氏之抵美消息、不可爲不多、亦不可謂爲無關係、但市塲感覺仍頗麻木、蓋以目下市塲交易多數爲臨時性質、進出倏忽、不致牽動市面、大戶之執有現貨者、則仍信仰甚深、不爲環境所搖動、實已處於無可搖動之中、現貨之執於一般零星散戶手中者、究屬有限、屆此付息將近、不願受此無謂之犧牲也、昨日上午、存益錢莊買進甲種、十六號買進戊種、樂茂需要甲戊兩種、散戶則會集於丙種、但二十號及聯益仁昌等供出不少、市價祗甲種略堅、午後二十號又進戊種同順聯和及久豐對於丙種興趣皆濃、而三十八號賣出丙種獨多、甲種忽又有賣無買、致轉疲落、故結果乙丁兩種無上落、餘則稍小五分一角而已、成交的計六十餘萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>

<p>衆業公所昨日股市、開盤人心虛軟、蓋因假期內所傳消息不穩、而且嚴重、所有價格大抵較假前低落百分之十、但低價下、頗有買戶維持、收盤勢穩定、橡皮股黯澹、祇英渣華至十九元及地榜在一元之價、各有相當需求、</p>

<p>麵粉　昨市堅穩如常、查二號粉廠盤、經上週連加三决後、當局已嚴行監督、限定米價、不得超過六月二十九日之收盤價格、老車牌麵粉零售每包不得超過十五元五角、所以廠盤勢難再加、而米價愈貴、粉銷愈增、全日間兩廠直接批出者、的計一千五百包、回籠貨價站十六元四五角、客盤則須十七元以上、但均無正式成議、惟近日內地日廠粉、逐有運申、聞金山牌開價爲十六元、成交亦有千餘包、</p>
<p>小麥　連日新小麥來源、雖有逐批運到、均非華商搬運、而湧旺時期、恐尚有待、目下日廠與華廠均有放盤收買之勢、聞外商强生廠購進蕪湖麥二百包、價已開至二十五元一角、福新廠亦收進二百五十包、同價、至市塲正式交易、概無所聞、其他日廠零星收買者、更不能視爲正市論也、</p>
<h3>紗花　粗紗去路尙佳　雙馬大跌小回</h3>
<p>銀行結賬以後之紗市、昨已照常營業、市態始疲後平、此因實際交易尚好、香港雲南兩幫、對於粗紗需要殷切、於是呆滯乏力之市面、雖香港事態嚴重、完全被現銷所打銷、據華南莊客云、購進之紗、改道裝運、由仰光轉往昆明、所以人心復振云、惟昨晨現貨行情、比廠棧單價廉三十元、顯成倒掛局面、港滇雖在採辦、然尚難挽回此疲頹之市面、二十支雙馬仍在九百元關內盤旋、</p>
<p>現紗晨開因報載香港局勢緊張、此乃市面不安之最大因素也、故人氣疲弱、二十支雙馬價爲八百六十五尤、此封關之前一跌六十元、但有一部份復來收進幾包、又回漲至八百八十五元、旋聞外匯軟化、又轉下風、疲至八百七十元、卒以雲南香港兩幫採辦良好、有一千三百包交易、漲至八百八于七元收盤、查半日問成交統計二千九百四十包、行情二十支雙馬跌三十八元、今日有棉紗三十件運香港、茲將各幫口買去之額量、分列如左、</p>
<p>同行一、三八〇　香港　六八五</p>
<p>雲南　七四〇　內地　七〇</p>
<p>寗波　一二五　統計二、九四〇</p>
<h3>印棉慘跌　訂貨源源而到</h3>
<p>現棉情形依然奄無生氣、此因紗市平庸、加之海外印棉跌風甚熾、所以人心更乏興奮性、而昔日各方購訂之印棉、仍舊源源而來、不過日廠稍有納胃、然付軟之期較遲一二個月、華廠方面較爲靜寂云、</p>
<p>外棉市價、紐約棉市、晨初因受賣方之壓力而跌、後因現貨交易良好、及一部份購買新花、結果收盤價格、近期較之上日跌落八磅音、遠期反漲二三磅音、印度因運輸困難、當地商人、紛紛在市售出、因之售價慘落、昨日連同預測父跌七羅比餘、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、因各方盛傳、英貨將不再由日輪裝載、如係確實、則祇有大英公司船艘可能裝運、唯英輪需運之貨太多、將來印棉之到滬、將更覓稀少、現貨之可居奇、恐有必然、故同業間因被此消息之刺激、心意堅定異常、唯日來交易淸淡、除日廠尚有故銀期之若干零星交易、華廠方面則靜寂異常也、</p>
<h3>雜糧　油廠動辦黃豆　行情依然高昂</h3>
<p>昨日黃豆市况、因來源稍繼加之囤戶手貨勢難久擯、故僵持至昨市在榨油廠辦胃殷切之潛勢下、賣買兩旺、致半日中交易頗見熱鬧、行情依然堅昂、統計做開靑島豆三千餘包、價爲三十元、蚌埠豆十八車、價爲二十九元、安慶豆千餘包、價爲二十八元五角至二十九元二角、及大連夾靑豆四百包、價爲三十一元、消東杜豆五百包、價爲二十八元九角至四角、崇明沙黃一百包、價爲二十七元云、</p>
<p>又豆子今日有六百三十七包、運往香港、</p>
<h3>糖巿　外匯趨鬆　粗車白立降</h3>
<p>昨糖市因外匯見鬆、價乃同跌、公會劃盤、現貨二四組白本棧六十九元七角、外　六十九元、跌去元許、轉口貨五十四元半、七月十日打棧單五十五元二角、跌一元五六角、西棧太古車白B嘜八十元至七十九元半、降元半至二元、HY嘜七十七元半、荷赤小二角、爲五十七元半、本雲白六十九元半、一號冰九十一元半、晶明冰九十三元、惟國糖仍穩、刁靑開出太古輪到貨百餘包、六十四元半、升五角、條靑數十簍、四于六元、又昨日由香港來糖二百包、</p>
<h3>疋頭　棉布步步下瀉</h3>
<p>國布　昨市以封關前氣勢尚盛、故開槃價格均堅、惟旋以缺少買戶、售盤卽步步下瀉、結果白貨細布·斜紋·粗布·每疋各跌二角半至五角、漂染印花布售盤參差殊巨、約跌一元左右、木街批發號應兩路沿綫及蘇北皖北去路、辦粗布漂染布八千餘疋、浙贛幫辦細布粗布色布一百五六十件、豫幫以隴海路戰事緊急、去貨銳减、粵滇幫亦陷停頓狀態中、惟北路烟津幫辦色布綫呢等貨一百餘件、</p>
<p>東布　昨晨開盤市氣堅挺、龍頭細布見三于一元五角、詎同業傾賣、客戶束手、步步下挫、跌風殊猛、後市收盤降至二十八元七角半、四君子嗶嘰每碼自九角起亦跌至八角四分半、在實銷觀察、短時期內尚乏好面、微聞日商各廠已於木月一日起减工十分之三、希冀維持大跌之市價、但結果恐難如願也、</p>
<p>出口　棉布、今日有十九件、運往香港、</p>
<h3>絲茶　錫絲陸續抵滬</h3>
<p>前昨兩日無錫白廠絲、有大批到滬、計由華成·復興·朝井等轉運來申、爲數當在三百担左右、出運辦法、大致每担均爲三百元之特別開銷、聞無錫絲廠成品囤積、已達一千餘担、七月開始後、出運問題、將更困難生絲昨由香港來十件、又來人造絲三大籍、</p>
<h3>藥材　相思豆到貨多　行情跌五六十元</h3>
<p>相思豆自前市售開二百元後、貨主方面頗能獲利、因此不乏連續運申、故市存頗見充盈、然邇日銷胃反呆、致售突降、目前上檔無黑子者為一百五十元、次之一百四十元、受手尚稀、前後相較須跌去五六十元之鉅</p>
<h3>海味　螟埔回振</h3>
<p>螟蜅前市客銷呆滯、勢殊疲弱、如外山蜅僅售一百零五元、乃近日到貨旣稀、去化漸呈活潑、人心因之看好、刻市已高叫一百十五元、其次寗波　亦須八十五元、烟台貨甚少、叫百元</p>
<h3>煤炭　鴻基小子缺貨</h3>
<p>鴻基一號小子白煤、近來因時入夏令、各洗衣作生意發達、銷路亦隨之轉旺、但產地來頭原檔貨極缺、價乃蒸蒸日上、市上一號小子每噸已喊兩百二十元、價超塊煤而上、二號小子兩百十元、篩小子照盤便宜五六元行情、</p>
<h3>南北貨　夏橘餅看漲</h3>
<p>厦門橘餅、前以到貨軋缺、號貨已斷檔多時、查昨日四川輪入口到有二十桶、據客方函訊、成本較昂、嗣後又值　令、故號盤喊升三四元、尚未威交、照市象而論、勢在必升、</p>

<p>人物</p>
<h3>羅馬尼亞的風流國王</h3>
<p>— 溫和</p>
<p>講到羅馬尼亞國王卡洛爾二世一生的事蹟，活像一部好萊塢式的宮闈電影：旣香艷，又刺激，有纏綿的愛情，也有緊張的戰事。卽使他的儀表，也是生得翩翩風流，得以讓他自己來主演這部電影，也是萬分的合適。</p>
<p>別看他現在是個很專制的君王，在年靑的時候，他也是一個社會主義者呢。他屢决的表示：君主政體，早已落伍，他是篤信共和，服膺社會主義的。那時他的伯祖卡洛爾一世在位，看見王室中出了這樣一個前進靑年，心裏大大的不樂，便硬生生的不許他讀書，叫他去當兵。</p>
<p>這個相信社會主義的王子，的確平民化得很澈底。他愛上了一個平民姑娘齊齊女士（Zizi　Lambrino）。那時他的父親弗迪南已經接位，不過這位父王陛下，爲人糊塗無能，還是他的母親瑪麗王后（英國維多利亞女皇的孫女）來得精明强幹，她極力反對她的兒子同一個平民結婚。可是卡洛爾太子也是個利害人物，他很善於利用機會。當德國大軍打進羅馬尼亞，羅馬尼亞的王室和殘兵敗卒一古腦兒逃到俄羅斯時，他看準機會來了，便放胆的去和齊齊女士結了婚。這時大家在做難民，他的尊長雖然反對這頭親事，然而也奈何他不得。他同齊齊結合之後，生了一個兒子。</p>
<p>他的母親知道同他硬反對也沒有用，她明白要想使一個靑年忘掉一個女子，頂好的辦法是另外給他弄一個。斯以她從中撮合，設法介紹他去同希臘的海倫公主在瑞士晤面。這位海倫公主可以說是當時歐洲各王室的金枝玉葉中生得頂漂亮的一個，兩人後來就在雅典富麗堂皇的舉行婚禮。結果他又有了一個兒子。可是他覺得這種生活太乏味了。</p>
<p>却巧羅京一個財政家有一位女兒，她有淺紅的頭髮，雪白的皮膚，非但生得妖媚入骨，而且聰慧異常。她就是異日名滿全球的魯班斯古夫人（Madame　Lupescn），卡洛爾又和她發生起愛情來了。她終於有了孕，爲了要使她肚中的孩子有一個名義上的爸爸，她就同他的一個衛隊軍官結了婚。這個孩子就是卡洛爾的第三個兒子。</p>
<p>後來，魯夫人離開了羅京，漫游全歐。卡洛爾太子竟再度決心犧牲他的尊位，他也離開了羅京。一對情侶在意大利碰頭，後來又到了法蘭西和英吉利。</p>
<p>瑪麗王后對了這個兒子，眞覺得沒有辦法對付。羅馬尼亞不再匯錢給他去使用了，好讓他覺悟。可是魯夫人的商業手腕十分高明，他同她合作做生意，做得很順利。他同西歐各銀行往來之下，早就把年輕時候的社會思想，拋在腦後了。這幾年的商業經騐，把卡洛爾養成了一個精明的商人，他現在居然還想賺希特拉的錢呢。</p>
<p>他同魯夫人親密的生活着，他覺得很幸福，便自動的宣佈放棄王位承繼權。他們有錢，有朋友，還有自由，誰還希罕這個沉悶的朝廷呢？所以後來羅國國會通過法律，規定他永不得繼位時，他又不過一笑置之。</p>
<p>一九二七年，卡洛爾的父王薨了，卡洛雨的六歲兒子曼考爾登了大寶。一向反對卡洛爾的頑固官僚們居然組了攝政團，作威作福。卡洛爾在外國看見這種情形，心裏十分難受。一九三〇年的一天，他突然坐了飛機回國，全球都很詫異，幾天之後，他推翻了自己兒子的王位，自己加冕做國王了。</p>
<p>在這種國際情形之下，他這個國王倒也很難做。不過他記淸羅馬尼亞是上决大戰的戰勝國，他決不肯放鬆他的戰利品。在歐洲各小國的領袖裏面，他恐怕才是希特拉的勁敵：他同希特拉一樣的愛冒險，一樣的貪權力，一樣的歡喜不平凡的生活。</p>

<h3>舞后的歸宿</h3>
<p>— 程小靑著</p>
<p>第二章　「一頁往史！」</p>
<p>倪金壽似乎因著旣已奪得了發話的機會，不肯再放鬆一步。他索性攔住了記事冊和筆，繼續發問；「他來做什麼？」</p>
<p>金梅道：「自然是來找王小姐。他聽得王小姐不在，很發火。他好像要找伊爲難的樣子，模樣兒很可疑。」</p>
<p>霍桑的眼光閃了一閃，又恢復了發話地位，連連點頭說：「對，對，他有這樣的事，那當然是很可疑的。不過我們還得言歸正傳，先把這余甘棠跟你主人爭吵的原因弄一弄明白。他們怎樣爭吵起來的？」</p>
<p>霍桑雖然設法把話題重新牽進了港口，却又引起了金梅的躊躇。伊頓一頓才說：「我也不知道究竟爲什麼緣故。」</p>
<p>「你剛纔不是說爲了趙伯雄嗎？」</p>
<p>「這是——這是我的猜想。」</p>
<p>「好，就說：你的猜想也不妨。」</p>
<p>伊吞吐地說：「那一天——那就是李姑老爺來的一天，趙伯雄在這室中跟王小姐談話。余少爺忽然來了，兩個人就吵起來。後來幸虧李老爺從樓上下來，方才把余少爺解勸出去。從那天以後，余少爺不曾來過。」</p>
<p>霍桑道：「這余少爺跟趙伯雄鬧嗎？」</p>
<p>「是的。」</p>
<p>「你剛纔說他和王小姐吵嘴啊。」</p>
<p>「他先和趙伯雄鬧，後來又和王小姐吵。」</p>
<p>「這倒奇怪。爲什麼？」</p>
<p>「因爲——因爲王小姐好像幫姓趙的說話。伊又向伊的死主人瞧了一瞧。」</p>
<p>「唔，你總聽得他們鬧的時候說些什麼罷？」</p>
<p>「我不仔細——我不在旁邊。」</p>
<p>霍桑緩綏把烟尾丟到了圓桌上的銀質烟灰盒裏去。他的眼光在掠過桌面上的那兩隻酒杯的時候，忽而作一度小小的停頓，似在欣賞玻璃杯上鐫刻的花紋。</p>
<p>他突然問道：「余少爺也喝酒嗎？」</p>
<p>金梅也抬頭向桌上的酒杯瞥了一眼，搖頭說：「他不喝酒。……那趙伯雄倒喝。」</p>
<p>「喔，你怎麼知道的，」</p>
<p>「我好幾决瞧見趙伯雄跟王小姐」塊兒喝酒。」　（三四）</p>

<h3>龔秋霞家庭訪問紀</h3>
<p>— 凱壯</p>
<p>當年的梅花五虎將之一，最近在「雁門關」一片演出的龔秋霞，與她的「先生」胡心靈，小姑胡蓉蓉，在銀壇上，同樣是「一門三傑」，這是出乎意料之外的，昨日記者到明德里訪友，巧遇胡心靈，於是便在他府上作了一番閒談：</p>
<p>「關於胡君以前的導演生活，請你告訴我一點：」</p>
<p>「說起導演生活，眞不敢當，是在民國二十三年吧，家父紹虞與一位律師合辦文化影片公司，就在兒童年的那個年頭，我導演了一部「父母子女」，就是由蓉蓉，與龔秋霞主演的。翌年，明星公司託人邀請，乃加入了明星二廠，曾與歐陽予倩合作，導演「淸明時節」，在明星二廠結束後，又在一廠與張石川鄭小秋合導「壓歲錢」，胡蓉蓉主演。</p>
<p>有許多人想知道一點你們二位的相戀史，可吾發表一點」記者說畢，龔小姐笑笑地，意思表示叫胡心靈不要說，但結果他還是告訴了我一點，他說：</p>
<p>「我倆的認識，是在她隸屬於梅花歌舞團時開始，至於她在儉德儲蓄會歌舞班時，被此還未相識。」說畢，胡蓉蓉挾了書包回家來了。</p>
<p>「蓉蓉近來沒有戲拍吧，」記者問。</p>
<p>「是的，因爲現在電影界的趨向，對於一個小孩拍戲，似乎不大適合，所以不久前有幾家影片公司有意邀蓉蓉拍戲，我都婉拒了，讓她好好地讀一下子書冉說。」</p>
<p>「那麼胡先生本人對於電影事業，也很少顧及了吧？」</p>
<p>「是的，不知什麼緣故，我對於今日的電影界，似乎感到一種說不出的失望。我家裏一向是信奉基督敎的，所以近來我的志趣，轉變到基督敎方面去，現正在編寫幾部關於基督敎的書籍。</p>
<p>「但對於電影藝術，我們是不願放棄的，何况秋霞仍在新華拍戲，不過蓉蓉的恢復電影生活，也許要隔一個時期。」</p>

<p>— 濂</p>
<h3>「怒火之花」觀感</h3>
<p>— 鈞陶</p>
<p>飢餓的掙扎，家鄕的遠離，死亡的威脅，這一切，都是資本社會的罪惡。因爲壓迫的加深，被踐踏者會發生了反抗，和怒火；而反抗發怒所給的酬報，常常是浪跡。天下，飄泊東西，……這是本片故事的大概，他對於資本主義對弱小者的剝削，盡力揭發；醜態，盡力指摘，而那深刻的描寫，有力的烘托，更可說本片是資本主義的當頭棒，勞工階級的吶喊聲！</p>
<p>木片之意義旣如上述，而其作風與近來好萊塢型作品尤格格不相合，綜觀共特點，的有三點：（一）全片畫面都由粗線條組合而成，大有蘇聯影片風味，又利川了攝影燈光黑的效果使全片旣美麗，又可愛，最近影片中不可多得；（二）本片因忠於的翰史登貝克原著的關係，所以全片都在描寫湯美家庭的長途飄泊，喜怒哀樂的各種情形。而對於一般影片所不可缺少的羅曼史，也就沒有了！（三）導演的翰福特的作風有類於的翰史泰爾。（John　M．Stahl）他放棄了大高潮的刺激，而用細膩的描寫來貫通全片，然而處處都有緊張的演出。對白很繁重，如果聽不懂的話，那末看本片，是一個很大的損失。</p>
<p>全片美妙精彩之塲面頗多。如祖父不願往加州，遭家人設法迷醉，載之同去，及後死於途中。以及最後母子依依離別等戲，都使人有深刻的印象。大體講米，則前半部較後半部尤佳　而畫面的原始化，强調化，尤使人興奮！</p>
<p>導演的翰福特很不錯，技術手法都很精緻。演員亨利方達的湯美個性很適合，表演亦已臻化境，不過內心之痛苦尚不能表達盡凈飾凱茜的的翰加拉庭倒是一個成功的演員。其餘飾母親的琴達惠兒，飾祖父的却利特拉潑玲等等，亦皆不可多得。總之，本片是一張很有意義的片子。</p>
<h3>彈詞二十種（十三）雙珠鳳</h3>
<p>— 凍雲撰文岫烟製圖</p>
<p>「落金扇一（彈詞二十種之六）的劇情是「陸慶雲小姐遺落了一柄泥金小扇，給周學文拾到了；於是賣身學歌，還扇求愛，終遂眷屬之願。」現在這一部雙珠鳳，是重複地搬演了這樣一個故事。不過把珠鳳代替了金扇，「落金扇一裏的周學文和陸慶雲，在這裏是文必正和霍定金。</p>
<p>文必正賣身入霍府後，無法入小姐深閨；紅樓一角，咫尺天涯！幸得霍天官壽辰，啣命送花，才算徼倖地實現了他的期望。這一節「送花樓會」，是唱「雙珠鳳」的彈詞家們所謂關子書』。</p>
<p>從前「多妻主義」時代，「風流才子」當然不能以一個夫人爲滿足。於是著書人在文必正佔有了定金秋華一雙主婢外，更拉上了倪阿鳳做陪賓，還嫌不够熱鬧，又饒上一個李珠鳳。</p>
<p>霍定金遺失的飾物是「珠鳳」，李小姐的閨名恰也唤做「珠鳳」，這就是所謂「雙珠鳳」了。</p>

<h3>Whatever Happens, the British Government is Determined to Defend Hong Kong; The British King Appoints Major General Nording as Governor of Hong Kong; Plans to Evacuate British Nationals from Japan are Under Consideration</h3>
<p>London: The British government began considering plans last night to evacuate British nationals in Japan. However, official circles stated that there are no immediate plans to evacuate British nationals in Japan. These plans are in the drafting stage. It is reported that Britain is preparing to instruct Sir Robert Craigie, the British Ambassador to Japan, to respond to Japan's demand to cut off the route for transporting war materials and supplies to the Dong Qing government from Burma. It is believed that Britain will consult with Australia before sending a reply to Japan. At the same time, Britain will exchange views with Washington and Moscow, as Japan's demand is of great importance to American and Soviet goods. Foreign commentators here doubt that Japan will be satisfied with the planned transfer of British troops stationed in Shanghai to Hong Kong. British authorities stated last night that Britain is determined to defend Hong Kong in any event. (United Press, 3rd)</p>
<p>London: Official circles announced that the current Governor of Hong Kong, Sir Geoffrey Northcote, is not currently in Hong Kong. The British King has appointed Major General Nording as Governor of Hong Kong. Major General Nording is currently serving as commander of a district in western India and will soon come to Hong Kong to take office. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>Hong Kong: Hong Kong learned today that it will be governed by a military governor, the first time for the colony since 1912. The renowned explorer and current Governor of the Madras region, Major General Nording, has been appointed as the acting Governor of Hong Kong. Sir Geoffrey Northcote, the Governor of Hong Kong, went on leave on May 19 to recuperate in Ceylon. During Governor Northcote's leave, Major General Nording will act as governor. Plans to evacuate other European and American women and children from Hong Kong are continuing today. (United Press, 3rd)</p>
<p>San Francisco: Former U.S. Consul General in Shanghai, Gauss, arrived here en route to his new post as Minister to Australia yesterday. He stated that Britain may defend Hong Kong against any Japanese aggression. Gauss also stated that the Hong Kong government should evacuate non-combatants, which is taking a firm stance to deal with the Japanese threat. Gauss predicted that the small garrison in Hong Kong, combined with the British fleet stationed in China, would be sufficient to resist the invasion of Hong Kong. Gauss declined to comment on the possibility of the U.S. fleet being transferred to the East. (United Press, 3rd)</p>
<p>Manila: The American ship President Coolidge arrived here this morning from Hong Kong with one hundred American refugees. At the same time, the Japanese ship Empress of Japan also arrived with one thousand six hundred and forty British women and children. The wharves where the two ships docked were under special police protection. During the landing, teams from the U.S. Army and the Philippine Red Cross were dispatched to supervise. All the refugees have now been sent to the McKinley and Sternberg concentration camps in Baguio, where they will be provided for by the U.S. Army and the Philippine Red Cross. (United Press, 3rd)</p>
<p>Manila: 1,740 evacuees from Hong Kong arrived here at dawn today. The Empress of Japan carried 1,640 British citizens, and the President Coolidge carried 100 Americans. Due to quarantine regulations, they were temporarily detained outside the breakwater. They only docked at the wharf at about 11:30 a.m. After disembarking, the evacuees were taken in order by prepared vehicles to their designated destinations, some to Baguio, some to the U.S. military barracks at Fort McKinley, and some to the Philippine military barracks in Calamba, 80 miles from Manila. As a result of the sudden increase in population in Manila, there is a housing problem. All available empty houses are already full. The influx of these evacuees will increase the existing European population of Manila by 130%. Philippine President Quezon has issued a strong warning against profiteering, saying that this action cannot be tolerated. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>Hong Kong: The Hong Kong government is currently planning measures to search for those who are evading evacuation from here. It is now known that only 2,000 women registered yesterday to be evacuated. This number is far below the authorities' expectations. According to a government spokesperson, it is now evident that some people are attempting to hide and avoid evacuation. The government now feels that the successful completion of the evacuation is of utmost importance, especially for children, who should be made to leave Hong Kong. Therefore, measures are now being planned to search for those who have not registered and to order them all to leave Hong Kong. (United Press, 3rd)</p>
<p>Hong Kong: The Hong Kong government has announced that the compulsory evacuation of non-Chinese women and children will soon be implemented. Those who disobey the order will be punished without leniency. The U.S. Consul General here said that he has not yet received notification of this order, but stated that he expects that American women and children here will be subject to this order in the same way as other foreigners. He also stated that because subsequent evacuations will be difficult to obtain comfort during the journey, Americans have not responded enthusiastically to the government's evacuation warning. Currently, only 120 Americans have left Hong Kong. The U.S. Consul General also stated that he has received notification from the U.S. high officials in Manila that the Philippine inter-island ship Basilan, currently docked in Hong Kong, will be used on July 5th and 6th to transport Americans to the Philippines. The owner of the Basilan has especially provided the ship for the needs of evacuating Americans. The ship can accommodate 54 first-class passengers and 2,300 steerage passengers. The U.S. Consul General also stated that Philippine customs has especially allowed the passengers' luggage to enter the country. The U.S. Consulate General here will still be open for business tomorrow, but the American community here will not hold the July 4th U.S. Independence Day celebration and will donate HK$2,250 to the British war effort.

<p>Reply to Japan Under Consideration</p>
<p>London: Undersecretary of State Butler stated in the House of Commons that the reply to Japan's request that Britain stop the transportation of weapons, ammunition, and certain other supplies through Burma and Hong Kong is currently under consideration. A member of parliament then raised a supplementary question, asking whether the government had considered that if Britain complied with Japan's request to stop the supply of goods to China via the Burma route, it would create a very bad impression in the United States. Butler replied that this consideration was in our minds. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>British-Japanese Negotiations on Food Supply</p>
<p>Hong Kong: According to the Japanese Consul General here, negotiations between Britain and Japan regarding guaranteeing an adequate food supply to Hong Kong have begun in Guangzhou. British Consul Blundell is currently negotiating with the Japanese authorities in Guangzhou. Japan may allow food from the mainland to be transported to Hong Kong. The Japanese Consul General stated that Japan is not blockading Hong Kong, but only preventing traffic between Hong Kong and the mainland, so there is no so-called naval blockade of Hong Kong. Eight American women, as well as French, Czech, and Russian refugees, will leave Hong Kong for Shanghai on a Japanese ship on Friday. As for the Japanese nationals in Hong Kong, none have been evacuated. A British military spokesperson stated that the British military authorities in Hong Kong were not aware of the news of the transfer of British troops stationed in Shanghai to Hong Kong. According to statistics, 2,129 foreign women and children registered with the authorities yesterday for evacuation, which was less than expected. This small number of registrations shows that most families hope that the authorities will exempt them from evacuation and allow them to remain in Hong Kong by registering for war service. Many wives of political and business figures have left Hong Kong for Guangzhou today. A Hong Kong government spokesperson stated that people who can afford their own travel expenses are allowed to move to any place and do not necessarily have to go to Manila, but those who go to Guangzhou cannot sneak back into Hong Kong at will. (United Press, 3rd)</p>
<p>Japanese Spokesperson Answers Reporters' Questions</p>
<p>Tokyo: Today, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs told foreign journalists that the overall situation in Burma will become clear after Japan receives a reply from Britain regarding Japan's request to stop military supplies from being transported to Chongqing via Burma. The spokesperson also stated in response to a question that the Burma issue and the Hong Kong incident are not directly related. A reporter asked whether it was necessary for Britain to consult with the United States before replying to Japan. The spokesperson replied that this should be decided by Britain itself, but as far as Japan is concerned, such consultation would only delay Britain's reply. Another reporter raised a question about the British-American secret naval agreement reported by the Kokumin Shimbun. The spokesperson replied that there was no official confirmation of this news, but recalled that during the 1938 Round Table Conference, there was a rumor of a gentleman's agreement between the British and American navies, stipulating mutual cooperation. According to reliable sources received on Tuesday, the Kokumin Shimbun reported that Britain and the United States have now signed a secret naval agreement with special relevance to the Pacific.

<h3>Japanese Troops Reinforcing Kaifeng Have Been Blocked by Chinese Forces; Remaining Japanese Troops in the South Gate Station Are Being Cleared</h3>
<p>Chongqing: After the Japanese and puppet Chinese troops entered Kaifeng, more than a thousand Japanese reinforcements attempted to enter the city again, but were blocked by Chinese forces. Chinese forces also destroyed a Japanese armored train. (United Press, 3rd)</p>
<p>Zhengzhou: Since the 30th, Chinese troops in eastern Henan have been cooperating with units that have defected from the enemy to eliminate the Japanese, successively capturing places such as Luyi and Mamuji. With the force of a sweeping storm, they have advanced towards Dongtai and Bo County, reaping many gains. As of the morning of the 1st, all these areas were completely under Chinese control, and the Chinese are currently continuing to expand their victories. (3rd)</p>
<p>Luoyang: On the 30th, Chinese troops in eastern Henan captured Luyi. With irresistible force, they pursued the retreating enemy, killing countless Japanese along the way. The remaining Japanese troops retreated to Bo County. The Chinese besieged the county seat on the afternoon of the 30th, engaging in fierce fighting until the evening, and stormed into the town. The Japanese suffered heavy casualties. The grain depots and military supply warehouses in the town were all burned down by the Chinese forces, with flames lighting up the sky and not extinguishing all night. As of the morning of the 1st, the Chinese and Japanese were still fighting in the streets. On the same day, the Japanese in Zhuxian were attacked fiercely by Chinese forces and retreated, and the Chinese then recovered Zhuxian. (2nd)</p>
<p>Luoyang: The remaining Japanese troops trapped at the southeast foot of Kaifeng are still being fiercely attacked by the Chinese. On the morning of the 30th, more than a thousand Japanese troops from Xinxiang, riding in more than forty cars and under the cover of armored vehicles, drove south along the Bianxin Road to reinforce. When they reached Caiyuan Station, they were met with a head-on attack by the Chinese. After fierce fighting until 12 p.m., one Japanese armored vehicle and more than ten cars were destroyed. Japanese corpses piled up like mountains. The Chinese are currently intensifying their efforts to annihilate them. At the same time, the remaining Japanese troops who were stubbornly defending the South Gate were also completely annihilated by the Chinese, who are now sweeping through South Gate Street. (2nd)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Spirit of American Independence and the Current International Situation</h3>
<p>Today is American Independence Day, the day the thirteen North American colonies issued the Declaration of Independence. At that time, the people of those thirteen colonies, in order to resist illegal oppression and exploitation, did not hesitate to begin a revolutionary war to fight for freedom and independence in extreme hardship and poverty. Thanks to the heroic determination of Washington and other revolutionary leaders, and the vigorous and effective use of diplomacy, they finally laid a foundation for victory after five years of hard fighting, and established the first democratic republic in the midst of hardship, opening a new page in modern history. This magnificent drama, though now a full 165 years ago, is still an unparalleled model for resisting aggression and building a nation, not diminished in the slightest by the passage of time. Moreover, the contribution of the American Revolution is not limited to the birth of the United States of America. In a global sense, it was no less than an alarm bell for human rights, a beacon of enlightenment, enabling people in both the old and new worlds to understand the incomparable value of freedom and independence, and therefore willing to pay the price of blood and flesh to transform their own destiny. The United States and its people, precisely because they have experienced such a arduous struggle, are better able to appreciate the meaning and preciousness of freedom and independence, and therefore all struggles undertaken to realize this principle receive full sympathy and encouragement from the United States. China has also benefited greatly from this. This is what people should pay tribute to the United States and its people on this American Independence Day.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the evolution of this real world is not entirely consistent with the principle of progress. In the past ten years or so, the world has not moved towards brightness, but has become increasingly dark, almost reversing the entire world to the era before the American Revolution. Recently, all of Europe has fallen into the tragedy of war, and the acts of aggression in the Far East have intensified. In addition to causing devastation in China, they have spread to the equatorial zone, causing a storm in the Western Pacific and the Indian Ocean. In this vast universe, only the Western Hemisphere still maintains a clean land, but it cannot escape the invasion of the shadows of aggression. The fundamental beliefs that were universally established in the world by American independence have now been subjected to unprecedented destruction. In some places, violence and conquest dominate everything; in some places, enslavement and humiliation replace independence and freedom; and modern civilization and democratic politics have also encountered unprecedentedly serious trials. This is a rare change in modern history, and at the same time it has further increased the responsibility of the United States, which has excellent political traditions and great national potential.</p>
<p>In the international changes of the past decade, the United States has made indelible contributions, such as establishing the principle of non-recognition of territorial changes by force, criticizing and condemning acts of aggression, and various appeals and measures regarding events in Asia and Europe. These are commendable and wise actions, but unfortunately, their actual effect is negligible. Moreover, as of today, the situation has become increasingly difficult and complex. On the one hand, even the US authorities have admitted that words and protests alone are not effective. On the other hand, the crisis comes from both Europe and Asia, and the urgency and importance of the two are also difficult to assess. If one cannot see the big picture from the small, and make decisive decisions, then one may not miss the opportunity and repeat the repeated failures of the past decade. The reason why aggressors dare to be reckless and start wildfires may also be because they see the weaknesses of the United States' complex internal political views, the upcoming elections, and so on, so they are eager to strike first in order to achieve their goals. Recently, the US fleet has returned to the Pacific, which is a sedative for the Far East crisis, but it is clearly insufficient to eliminate the crisis. The US government and people are still striving to avoid the spread of war, and there is still considerable distance between empty protests and war, and there are still some effective measures that can be used, such as the most wise measure in the Far East being to intensify cooperation with China and use its economic power. This should not be hesitated from either a moral or self-interest point of view. As for whether the Atlantic or Pacific crisis is more important, it is difficult to draw a conclusion quickly, but the situation in Europe is complex, while the Far East is far simpler. Germany and Italy in Europe are gaining momentum, while the aggressors in the Far East are already on the verge of decline and exhaustion. The future development of the European situation is still uncertain, while the threat in the Far East is getting closer and closer, and can no longer be condoned. If one hesitates and looks around, so that in the future one has to deal with attacks from both sides at the same time, why not start with the more urgent and easier aspects first, and quickly bring peace to the Pacific storm?</p>
<p>The United States is not lacking in enlightened people, and at such a critical moment, it should no longer be concerned about maintaining personal political views and monetary profits. One hundred and sixty-five years ago, the United States set an example for the world by starting the democratic political revolution, and today in the 20th century, the United States should be the most powerful fortress for upholding freedom and independence. Unless the United States immediately uses its strong potential to take active measures to eliminate this worldwide tragedy and evil, the political beliefs that spread around the world as a result of American independence will inevitably become more and more decadent, and even whether the New World can maintain this in the long run will become a question. While celebrating the anniversary of American independence, I respectfully submit this idea to the American government and people.</p>
<h3>Song Ziwen Re-visits U.S. President to Discuss the Overall Situation in the Far East; Urging the U.S. to Take Effective Action to Restrain Japan; New U.S. Loans to China Under Consideration</h3>
<p>Washington: Mr. Song Ziwen, Chairman of the Bank of China and former Minister of Finance of the Nationalist Government, held his second meeting with President Roosevelt yesterday. During lunch, Mr. Song continued to talk with the President. Lunch was sent to the President's desk by attendants on trays. According to reliable sources, President Roosevelt wanted to inquire in detail about the situation in the Far East, including the recent developments in China, French Indochina, and Japan. Diplomatic circles believe that Mr. Song will ask the President to take new actions to help China resist Japan, especially regarding the US fleet's move to the Atlantic. Well-informed sources said that Mr. Song is negotiating new credit loans with the US government, and the US government is giving Mr. Song's request serious consideration. Before his second meeting with President Roosevelt yesterday, Mr. Song visited Secretary of State Hull and met with Mr. Jones, Chairman of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. Subsequently, Hull and Jones held talks. Mr. Song declined to tell reporters about his visits to the President, Secretary of State Hull, and Mr. Jones, Chairman of the Export-Import Bank. The President told reporters that Mr. Song's visit was "of a social nature." The President referred to Mr. Song as his "old friend." The President said that their talks included various world events, but he did not elaborate. Mr. Song also met with Undersecretary of State Welles yesterday. Mr. Song said that the visit was not of great significance, while Welles said that it was just "reminiscing about friendship." It is reported that Hull hosted a banquet for Mr. Song last Friday. Mr. Song met with Treasury Secretary Morgenthau and Export-Import Bank President Bearson. Mr. Song also met with British Ambassador to the United States Lothian yesterday. Well-informed sources said that Mr. Song will soon return to New York, but will come to Washington again before returning to China. (United Press, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Roosevelt Issues Decree Banning Export of Military Supplies; Copper and Scrap Iron Will Be Banned; Heavy Blow to Japan's Urgent Needs</h3>
<p>Washington: President Roosevelt signed a decree today banning the export of various important military materials, including aluminum, antimony, asbestos, chromium, manganese, magnesium, mercury, spectacle lenses, quinine, rubber, silk, tin, wool, various chemicals, aircraft parts, iron plates, bulletproof glass, and machine tools. (Haitong, 3rd)</p>
<p>Washington: Yesterday, President Roosevelt signed the "May Act," after which the President has the power to ban the export of all military supplies. After signing the bill, Roosevelt immediately announced that 46 specific goods would require special permits for export starting next Thursday. It is said that the raw materials and products division of the Defense Advisory Commission is currently determining the items to be controlled and setting limits to ensure that the goods are adequately stored for domestic defense purposes. Although officials say that a complete embargo is not currently being considered, rubber, tin, silk, aluminum, and other metals, as well as machinery, will certainly be subject to control. Moreover, according to the bill he signed, President Roosevelt has the power to ban the export of all raw materials and supplies necessary for the manufacture of weapons, so it is conceivable that the President may soon ban copper, scrap iron, and oil. These three items are in great demand by other powerful countries, especially Japan. (International News Service, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Singapore Strengthens Alert, Prohibits Nighttime Navigation</h3>
<p>Singapore: The official gazette here announced yesterday that to strengthen the alert here, local ships are not allowed to sail in Singapore waters from sunset to sunrise. Large ships are not allowed to sail at night. People are not allowed to land at any port except for specific locations. The Singapore authorities also denied the evacuation of military families here.

<h3>Rumors of a Secret Naval Agreement Between Britain and the U.S. to Jointly Defend Pacific Interests Arouse Serious Concerns from the Japanese Authorities</h3>
<p>Tokyo: The "Kokumin Shimbun" claimed that the sudden evacuation of women and children from Hong Kong proves that Britain is not prepared to answer Japan's demands in a completely satisfactory manner. According to a telegram received yesterday, Britain's tough attitude is backed by the assistance of the United States, and a large-scale secret British-American naval agreement in the Pacific is about to be concluded. It is reported that Senator Pittman has approved it. The terms of the naval agreement are as follows: (1) If new international problems arise in the Pacific, Britain and the United States mutually recognize that they have common interests. (2) In this regard, Britain and the United States will dispatch their fleets for the purpose of joint defense. (3) In view of the seriousness of Hong Kong's political and military significance and the current situation, Hong Kong will be placed under the actual management of the United States. (4) Hong Kong, Singapore, Darwin, Honolulu, and Dutch ports will become joint British-American naval bases. The newspaper added that this agreement aims to encircle Japan and has aroused serious concerns from official and non-official circles in Tokyo. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Stimson and Knox Advocate for US Rearmament to Face Two-Ocean Crisis; Stimson Confirmed as Secretary of War by Senate Military Committee</h3>
<p>Washington - Colonel Stimson, nominated by President Roosevelt for Secretary of War, read a prepared statement to the Senate Military Committee reviewing his qualifications, stating roughly that if we sit and wait for the enemy to come, he does not believe we can avoid being invaded. The danger the United States faces is unprecedented. The duration of the current period of US military buildup largely depends on the continued British control of the North Atlantic. In this situation, any assistance the United States can provide to maintain British naval power in the North Atlantic is a critical step in US rearmament. The current situation is more precarious than last fall (when the arms embargo was lifted), and the time during which British naval power can be preserved is even more precious. No one wants to send American soldiers beyond our borders unless it is absolutely necessary to protect the United States itself. He does not believe that the United States can achieve security with purely passive or defensive national defense. The American defense line includes Puerto Rico, Bermuda, Newfoundland, and northeastern Canada. Everyone now recognizes that if a strong enemy gains a base in any of these places, they can launch aerial attacks on the US East Coast. All of these places except Puerto Rico are currently in the theater of war, so this line is already severely affected. He advocated for the immediate passage of legislation to establish a selective compulsory military training and service system. The passage of this bill would immediately make the entire nation aware of the serious nature of the events facing the United States and the need for each individual to contribute to addressing the crisis. In response to a question, Stimson said sending troops to Europe was impossible. A senator asked, "Do you think the United States should send troops to Europe?" Stimson replied, "I do not think so today. I do not believe we can land troops in Europe." The Senate Military Committee passed Stimson's appointment as Secretary of War by a vote of 14 to 3. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>During yesterday's Senate Naval Affairs Committee hearing on Knox's nomination as Secretary of the Navy, Senator Bone, a Democrat from Washington, publicly asked Knox to explain an editorial recently published in the Chicago Daily News under his management. The editorial stated that the United States should not allow Japan to seize the Dutch East Indies. Knox told Senator Bone that the United States should take all measures to prevent Japan from seizing the Dutch East Indies. He said, "Once we adopt a tough policy, we should not back down." At this point, Senator Walsh, chairman of the Senate Naval Committee, replied that senior officials of the US Navy had told him that the United States could not single-handedly prevent Japanese aggression in the South Pacific. Senator Holt, a Democrat from Virginia, then asked Colonel Knox for his opinion on the situation in the Far East. Knox said he advocated a "tough policy" in the Far East, but he could not take immediate action. He said, "I do not want to make unrealistic empty talk about the Far East at this time, because it is not appropriate to provoke a war on both oceans at the same time. If Britain falls, we may face a crisis in the Atlantic." Senator Walsh then interrupted Knox's remarks and asked him if he would change his attitude if he received notification that the US Navy could not operate alone in the Far East. Knox hesitated and replied that if this happened, the situation would be "greatly different." Walsh then said, "In that case, our conclusion would be that without the cooperation of Britain and France, we cannot operate alone in the Far East." Knox replied, "If so, then we should not make threats to others." Knox publicly stated to the Naval Committee that in national defense, especially when the US fleet is already in the Pacific, he advocated that the United States allow British and French warships to use its ports, "whether neutral or non-neutral." Later, the Senate Naval Committee held Knox's nomination in abeyance because Washington female reporter Ashley had published Knox's words in the newspaper, saying that he advocated sending an expeditionary force to Europe. The committee will hear testimony from Ms. Ashley today. Knox said that the statement did not represent his opinion because it was inaccurate and a misunderstanding.</p>
<p>Although Colonel Stimson had previously made numerous strong statements on Far Eastern policy, he now does not want to express other opinions on the Far East except for very general talk. Yesterday, he did not mention Far Eastern policy in the Military Committee. When faced with old challenges, Stimson refused to express an opinion on the philosophy of "Europe for Europeans, Asia for Asians." He said that he could not criticize without understanding the true situation. He also said that the reason he advocated that the British fleet must maintain its strength was so that the US fleet could maintain a strong presence in the Pacific. Colonel Stimson condemned the aggressor nations and said that the world is currently facing a threat from a group of countries whose foreign policy is systematically aggressive towards peace-loving neighbors.

It is believed that the bodies of the Hungarian soldiers will be left exposed to await the investigation of this border conflict by the neutral country committee. It is said that the Hungarian army was ambushed and attacked by the Romanian army, and almost the entire invading force was wiped out. Foreign military sources said that war materials are currently being transported from Germany to Romania, most of which are anti-aircraft guns, to complete the fortifications on the mountain peaks around the industrial center of Brasov in Transylvania province. It is said that before the Soviet Union delivered its final ultimatum to Romania, two hundred German planes arrived in Romania, so there were rumors that Romania was preparing to resist Soviet invasion. Romanian military circles said that the arrival of German arms in their country was not surprising. They said that Germany was merely fulfilling its contract with Romania. (Associated Press, 3rd)</p>

<p>Red Army Inspects Romanian Armories</p>
<p>Moscow - According to a reporter from Izvestia in Chainoveti, the city has begun a new life. Trams, telephones, post offices, and factories have all returned to normal operation. Workers have become the masters of the factories. Some residents have reported the locations of Romanian military camps and storage depots to the Red Army headquarters, and have also handed over the weapons and ammunition left behind by the Romanian army to the Red Army headquarters. According to the inspection results, these weapons and ammunition are all old-fashioned weapons made in foreign countries (especially England and France). According to Romanian soldiers, the morale of the Romanian troops was extremely poor. Russians and Ukrainians who refused to leave Bessarabia were shot. Romanian soldiers deserting and disobeying orders were common everywhere. The people of Chainovizhi are currently celebrating together, holding mass rallies and shouting slogans such as "Long live the Soviet government," "Thank you, great Stalin," and "Long live the Red Army." The city is now flying the Soviet flag. (TASS, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Romanian Foreign Minister Reports on Negotiations with the Soviet Union; Result of Painful Cession; Decision to Abandon Anglo-French Guarantees</h3>
<p>Bucharest - Romanian Foreign Minister Argetoianu delivered a speech yesterday at a joint meeting of the Foreign Affairs Committees of both houses, declaring: "On the night of the 26th of last month, the government received a report from the ambassador to Russia that the Soviet Russian government had made demands (the telegram had already been published). So, the next morning, a royal council was convened. In addition to the royal privy councilors and all cabinet members, the Chief of Staff also participated in the discussion. After detailed discussion, it was believed that without foreign aid, Romania would be difficult to resist for a long time. Therefore, we could not refuse the Soviet Russian side's 'bitter pill.' So, we replied to Moscow, asking them to postpone the deadline (the original telegram had also been published). At 9:00 pm on June 27th, expecting that the Soviet Russian reply would be received soon, the royal council was convened again. That night, we received the Soviet Russian reply, demanding the cession of territory within four days, and guaranteeing that all railways, factories, bridges, warehouses, airfields, industrial buildings, telephone power plants, etc. on the territory would be handed over to Soviet Russia in perfect condition. All outstanding issues would be resolved by a mixed committee. The reply was required by 12:00 noon, Soviet Russian time, on the 28th. The situation at that time was very clear. We only had two options: surrender or war. Since war was not guaranteed, we had to painfully accept the conditions. The result of this incident forced Romania to change its foreign policy, and therefore decided to announce the cancellation of the Anglo-French guarantees of April 13, 1939. Our great mountains and rivers are now being painfully ceded. The inner pain of the Romanian people is self-evident. We can only work, only unite, to cope with this difficult situation and to break this bad environment. We should shout, with loyal hearts and tragic tones, 'Long live indestructible Romania, long live the King!'" (Haitong Telegraph, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Gandhi Encourages Britain to Strive Hard; Opposes Use of Violence; Making Dishonorable Competition</h3>
<p>New Delhi - Gandhi published an article asking British people everywhere to adopt non-violent methods to replace methods of war in order to adjust international relations. He said, "I do not want Britain to fail, nor do I want Britain to win in the barbaric trial of force. If Britain, for the sake of victory, must take the same destructive work as the Germans by extremely thorough means, then this method cannot eliminate Nazism, but only make a dishonorable competition. Britain should fight with non-violent weapons worthy of a brave warrior. Even if Hitler and Mussolini occupy your beautiful islands, your homes, and make you be slaughtered, do not obey them." Gandhi also said that he loved Britain and that his love would not diminish because of any development. In this article, Gandhi revealed that he had notified the Viceroy of India that if he believed his service could be of any practical use in promoting the purpose of this article, he would be willing to be driven by the British government.

<h3>British Railway Workers' Union Launched Anti-Chamberlain Movement; Compromise Policy Misled the Country and Should Be Held Responsible; Resolution Passed Demanding Immediate Removal from Office</h3>
<p>London - The British National Union of Railwaymen held its annual meeting last night and passed a resolution demanding that all cabinet members who supported former Prime Minister Chamberlain and Chamberlain's appeasement policy be dismissed. This resolution coincided with the anti-Chamberlain movement launched by most of the British press and military members and other opposition members in parliament. Barton, explaining the resolution, said, "What we fear most today is not the power of the German air force and German mechanized troops, but the fifth column elements in our country still occupying high positions in the government. I do not want to name these people, nor do I want to put them to torture. I only want to see these people in positions where they cannot do harm, so as not to mislead the country as did Marshal Petain of France." He also said that this resolution would be sent to British Prime Minister Churchill by the union's delegation, and the delegation would also ask the Prime Minister for a direct reply. The resolution read, "Although this is a request from some of us, it has to be so, because it is a matter of public trust and national animosity. Cabinet members and other personnel in high positions who agree with the previous government's appeasement policy should be removed from office immediately and their positions should be given to people trusted by the people." At the same time, the Scottish National Union of Miners, which was held in Glasgow, also passed a similar resolution by a vote of 61 to 45, advocating the dismissal of all officials who supported Chamberlain's policy. The Scottish Trades Union Congress will also hold a special meeting to discuss the war situation, and it is rumored that the past actions of current political leaders will also be studied. Under the current situation, there may be another anti-Chamberlain movement in the House of Commons, but the Prime Minister does not intend to give the House of Commons any formal report before next week. However, Chamberlain and his associates currently occupy most of the power in the House of Commons, and the cabinet may not be able to change these elements. (Associated Press, 3rd)</p>

<h3>Rumors in London That Britain and Germany Are Brewing Peace; Rumors That Germany Has Proposed Peace Suggestions, Including Four Basic Conditions</h3>
<p>London - Most diplomats here believe that the recent lull in the Anglo-German war may be brewing peace. These diplomats have reported to their respective governments on the recent news that Britain has no intention of peace talks, and said that Germany may not be able to conquer Britain by means of aggression, and Britain is also difficult to attack Germany and the German-occupied territories in mainland Europe. They expect both Britain and Germany to suffer huge losses from air raids, but they do not believe that these air raids will determine the outcome of the war. An ambassador of a certain country told the Associated Press reporter that German envoys had recently made peace suggestions to many British people, but they were rejected by the British people. The contents of the peace suggestions included the following basic conditions: (1) Britain should recognize the new Greater Europe currently under German control, (2) Some British colonies should be ceded to Germany, (3) The colonies of France, Belgium, and the Netherlands should be changed to "European colonies" and ruled by Germany, (4) Germany and Britain should form an alliance. There is also a view on this type of German peace terms that the area Germany wants to form also includes some large areas of the European part of the Soviet Union. Regarding the third condition, some people are quite skeptical, saying that Germany would not merge the Dutch East Indies into the so-called "European colonies" to provoke Japan.

<h3>German High Command Releases Detailed Account of Second Phase of War - Infantry and Mechanized Units Coordinate, a Masterpiece of the German High Command</h3>
<p>Berlin: Yesterday, the Führer's headquarters released a detailed account of the German army's second offensive in France from June 5th until the signing of the armistice agreement. The details of this report are as follows:</p>
<p>While the battles in Flanders and Artois were not yet complete, the air force and several divisions within the army, which had not yet participated in the fighting, were prepared for a second offensive against France.</p>
<p>The prelude to the new war was a massive German air force attack on June 3rd on the airfields around Paris and the center of the aircraft manufacturing industry. It was decided that three army corps, commanded by Generaloberst von Rundstedt, Generaloberst von Bock, and Generaloberst von Leeb, would be ready to attack under the command of Generaloberst von Brauchitsch, Commander-in-Chief of the German Army. The goal of the German offensive was to break through the French northern lines and destroy the army by pushing it southwest and southeast. As the divisions under Generaloberst von Bock prepared to attack across the lower reaches of the Somme River and the Oise-Aisne Canal, it was discovered that the enemy was prepared to defend the area. The French commander decided to thoroughly defend the "Weygand Line" and the Maginot Line with all available troops. The French had devised a new defense method to stop the surprisingly rapid breakthrough of the German army's motorized units. After four days of fierce fighting, the infantry and armored divisions of General Kleeberg, General Richthofen, and General Strauss finally broke through the enemy lines. On June 9th, the German pursuit towards the lower reaches of the Seine River and Paris was in full swing. On the same day, General Hoth's rapid troops reached Roche and surrounded large numbers of enemy troops along the banks of the Cheppe and Saint-Souplet Rivers. As a result, the enemy's western flank was destroyed, and the western side of the line was stabilized. The German air force's group attacks were the main reason for the army's victory in the area. In the Seine River region, the German bomber offensive scattered the enemy infantry divisions and armored vehicles preparing to counterattack. The German air force also bombed railway lines and destroyed railway materials, preventing enemy reserves from being deployed to the front lines. When the enemy began to retreat at Le Havre, Cherbourg, and Brest, the air force immediately attacked the port facilities, fuel tanks, and ships in the above ports. Generaloberst von Rundstedt's corps' offensive towards Compiègne and the west bank of the Meuse River was the start of the general land offensive on June 9th. At the start of the major battle in the area, the infantry divisions led by General Weichs, General Licht, and General Busch broke through the Aisne defenses, allowing large motorized units to pass through smoothly. The land forces in the area received great assistance from the German air force. On June 11th, the armored car divisions and motorized infantry divisions of General Geyr von Schweppenburg and General von Kleist were prepared in the Châlons area to advance towards Troyes and destinations beyond Saint-Dizier. For the third time in twenty-five years, German troops crossed the Marne River. After several fierce battles, German motorized units broke through the enemy defenses in the southeast near the Swiss border. The ability of large numbers of infantry divisions and motorized units to coordinate with each other in a small area was truly a masterpiece of the German High Command. At this time, German forces had occupied the lower reaches of the Seine River and broken through the defenses protecting Paris. The enemy's western flank ceased resistance. On June 14th, General Guderian's troops entered Paris. The enemy forces on the northern line completely collapsed under the German pursuit. On the 14th, General Leeb's corps joined the fighting, launching a fierce offensive against the enemy's strongest fortresses. Two days later, with the assistance of a large number of artillery units, the troops of General Witzleben broke through the seemingly impregnable Maginot Line. As a result, the enemy's eastern, southern, and northern lines were threatened from the rear and split into two parts. The enemy's hope of resistance was declared extinguished. On the 15th, General Dollmann's troops occupied the upper reaches of the Rhine River near Colmar and broke through the Vosges Mountains. The close cooperation between the German air force and the army enabled the rapid completion of the encirclement of the Maginot Line south of Saarbrucken, Colmar, and Metz. The low-flying attacks of bombers and fighters were extremely effective. The anti-aircraft units assisted the advance of the infantry to great effect. At the same time, the air force assisted the infantry in advancing towards Besançon as far as the Swiss border. After June 15th, the pursuit from the coast to the Meuse River was on the largest scale. After the fall of Paris, the French army fled in disarray under the German general advance south and southwest and aerial bombardment. This frantic pursuit by land and air prevented the enemy from concentrating its forces on the opposite bank of the Loire River. The power of the German advance, even the Verdun fortress, a symbol of French resistance during the World War, could not withstand and finally fell on the 15th. On the 17th, German troops reached the Franco-Swiss border southwest of Besançon, thus encircling the French forces in Alsace-Lorraine and the Maginot Line. After crossing the Loire River, the enemy had no ability to resist. The French army had lost its fighting power and laid down its weapons. In this situation, French Premier Marshal Pétain asked the German government to present its armistice conditions. On June 21st, before the Führer and the German Commander-in-Chief, the humiliation of 1918 was completely erased in the original historical location of the forest of Compiègne. After the French delegation accepted the armistice conditions of the German Commander-in-Chief, it signed the document at 6:50 PM on the 22nd. At 1:35 AM on the 25th, the German and Italian armies ceased combat operations against France, bringing an end to six weeks of unprecedented fierce fighting. The German army achieved a great victory. The success of the second phase of the war was largely due to the achievements of the air force. The effective leadership of General Göring, the dedicated service of the air force generals, were all reasons for the victory. In terms of air defense, the proper command of General Glaubrecht and General Kreipe demonstrated a spirit of victory in every battle. The army, under the cover of the air force, spared no sacrifice in seizing positions, capturing enemy generals, and pursuing the fleeing enemy. After occupying the coasts of Holland, Belgium, and France, the navy had a new task, which was to convert the seaports into bases. The achievements of the German military buildup also shocked the world. People from all countries asked how the German army was able to achieve such remarkable feats in such a short period of time. It must be known that the reason for Germany's victory is what the enemy perceived as Germany's weakness. In other words, it is the revolution of the Third Reich and the leaders of National Socialism. These two have produced the best weapons of modern warfare, as well as the supreme commander, unified command of the army, navy, and air force, increased the efficiency of officers and soldiers, and created one of the most glorious pages in German history. From June 5th to 25th, General Specht, commander of the German corps, died for the country. A total of 16,822 officers and soldiers of the army, navy, and air force were killed, 9,921 were missing, and 68,511 were wounded. From the perspective of the state, Germany's victory over France resulted in very few casualties. However, for individuals, it is of course to be greatly regretted. The total number of German officers and soldiers from May 10th until the armistice agreement:</p>
<p>Compared to the World War, this can be considered negligible. In 1914, the German army lost 638,000 men on the Western Front, of whom 85,000 were killed. In the 1916 offensive at Verdun, it lost 310,000 men, of whom 41,000 were killed. In the Battle of the Somme, it lost 417,000 men, of whom 58,000 were killed. In the German offensive in France in April 1918, it lost 240,000 men (35,000 killed). How can the casualty statistics of this year's campaign, which brought France to its knees, be compared? It is impossible to know the extent of the losses on the French side, but 1,900,000 men were captured, including five corps commanders and approximately 29,000 officers. Its naval losses were also enormous (see another dispatch). Moreover, in addition to the heavy losses suffered by the enemy's army, navy, and air force, the armistice agreement has prevented the remaining French forces from participating in combat.

<p>England is the Only Enemy</p>
<p>Berlin: The conclusion of the German High Command's latest report stated: Since the German army defeated the land power in the Western Front who claim to be brave in the war, the great victory of Germany has caused the Allied countries to lose their existence. Now, the only enemy of Germany is England. (3rd dispatch by Huitong)</p>
<p>German Casualty Statistics</p>
<p>Berlin: The German High Command released the number of casualties suffered by the German army from the start of the offensive on the Western Front on May 10th until the day the armistice agreement was signed: 27,074 killed, 18,384 missing, and 111,034 wounded, totaling 156,492 casualties. (3rd dispatch by Huitong)</p>
<p>Berlin: The German High Command released the number of casualties suffered by the German army in the second phase of the German offensive in France from June 5th to June 25th: 16,822 killed, 9,921 missing, and 68,511 wounded.

<p>German War Booty</p>
<p>Berlin: According to the latest report released by the German High Command, since June 5th, the war booty captured by our army in France, in addition to the weapons and equipment of the Maginot Line and other fortresses, also includes the complete equipment of 55 French divisions.

<p>Geneva: French newspapers revealed the losses suffered by the French army in the battles in Belgium and France, as announced by the French government: 60,000 killed, 300,000 wounded, and 600,000 captured. According to the French official gazette, the reason for the French army's defeat was entirely due to the mistakes in the general staff's strategy. It defended important positions, while the enemy adopted a strategy of avoiding the strong and attacking the weak, attacking several strongholds of our army. As a result, the army's line of defense was broken through. The evacuation of residents was also a mistake, greatly affecting the morale of the soldiers. (3rd dispatch by Huitong)</p>

<h3>German Power Within Romania</h3>
<p>Sibiu is a stronghold of the Romanian New Party movement. The headquarters of the local leaders of the Romanian National Socialist Party and the German expatriate community are located there. All orders for the National Socialist Party district departments in Transylvania, Banat, Summer West, old Romania, and Bessarabia are issued from this place.</p>
<p>Although the city's residents include Germans, Romanians, and Hungarians, it is the Germans who control everything. Most of the shops are in German hands, and the Germans prevent people of other nationalities from setting up shops in prime locations within the city.</p>
<p>The economic lifeline of Sibiu is controlled by German banks, which have close ties with banks within Germany. These banks have young German merchants replacing non-Germanic positions. The streets are filled with uniformly dressed young people wearing Tyrolean-style hats and white socks, a fashion favored by Sudetenland National Socialists before the Munich Conference.</p>
<p>Most of what you hear on the streets is the German dialect. When people meet, they give the German salute. In bookstores, you see workers, and in the center of the bookstore is "Mein Kampf," priced at six U.S. dollars per copy.</p>
<p>Romanian students wear the uniforms of the Romanian Youth League, but German children wear their special hats, the color of which is very similar to that of Hitler's hat. If there are no Romanian soldiers on the street, one could easily feel as if they were in Germany.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Germans in Sibiu believe they are living in Germany. They rejoice every time they hear of a German victory and express joy every time a neutral country is invaded. The Germans of Sibiu consider themselves 100% German, and the National Socialist Party considers them the rulers of Transylvania. They all believe that the Germans in Romania will soon be under German government rule and are impatient for this to happen. They are willing to welcome Hitler in these places and immediately raise the German swastika flag, which they still dare not do openly. Countless swastika flags are being secretly manufactured in neighboring villages.</p>
<p>Sibiu is the center of so-called German reformation. These Germans were associated with Hitler before 1933, and after that year, they openly opposed the liberal Germans belonging to the mutual aid groups. Fabritius is the leader of the German expatriate community in Romanian Germany. He was a captain in the Austro-Hungarian army during the last Great War. After 1918, he became the owner of a poultry business and at the same time began political activities in Sibiu.</p>
<p>From this place, large numbers of young people go to Germany for training to become German propagandists, breaking the power of previous German leaders in Romania. The leaders of the former German minority in Romania, from Protestant bishops to cultural leaders, had to obey Fabritius' leadership. He also designated the candidates for the Romanian parliament. Currently, the German representatives, in the name of their leader, are loyal to the Romanian government. Fabritius has a very close relationship with the leaders in Berlin, and he has lived in Germany for several months.</p>
<p>Even when he is away, the National Socialist Party's headquarters does not stop its activities. Local leaders continue to travel to the districts they lead, and organizational work is clearly still underway. The German consul in Brașov visits Sibiu twice a week to hold lengthy talks with National Socialist leaders.</p>
<p>The main German newspaper in Romania is also published here. The entire editorial staff are trusted National Socialist Party members.</p>
<p>Other nationals in Sibiu are well aware that the National Socialist Party has placed them on a "blacklist." Although there is no open conflict, the relationship between the National Socialist Party and people of other nationalities is extremely tense. For example, in the Netherlands, people already feel the danger of the activities of the German Fifth Column. The only difference is that in Sibiu and its surroundings, the Germans are more numerous and better organized than in Rotterdam.</p>
<p>Outside of Sibiu, in Satu Mare and Medias, Romania, the Germans have recently tried to organize the minorities there. That place is only ten miles away from the Hungarian border. In addition to Romanians and Germans, there are many Hungarians. The National Socialist Party is trying hard to prove that these Hungarians are descendants of Germans.</p>
<p>Under the guidance of local leader Wessar, national conferences are held continuously to investigate the ancestry of the people. These meetings began in April and ended in early May.</p>
<p>In one village, despite the opposition of the church, the Germans held a meeting where twelve people went door-to-door to investigate the ancestry of each household. In the report of the local leader, it was pointed out that half of the residents no longer speak German. In his opinion, this is the fault of the pastors and teachers. In another town, the pastor did not use the school for meetings, and the local youth club and town hall were locked. In the end, they had to meet in a smaller convent.</p>
<p>From the detailed reports of the local leaders of the National Socialist Party, it is clear that the National Socialist Party members in Romania are actively active in the Northwest District. Although the Hungarians are very opposed to them, they have achieved some success. The local administrative authorities are extremely surprised that the Romanian government allows their activities, because the Romanian government has special orders that only the Romanian United Front is allowed to have political gatherings, and this area is also the most important national defense area, so it is difficult to allow the National Socialist Party to operate.</p>
<h3>European Radio Broadcasting War</h3>
<p>Every day, Britain and Germany engage in an aerial propaganda war, using dozens of radio stations broadcasting in dozens of languages. Their effects, though sometimes good and sometimes bad, mostly involve a bit of slyness and troublemaking. The Germans use fifty radio stations to constantly attack Britain, never saying a good word. They either say that Eden "only cares about clothes and can't talk," or mock the Minister of Economic Warfare, Cross, as "Minister of Famine."</p>
<p>Berlin broadcaster Fritzsche's masterpiece is in publicizing British naval losses. Sometimes the Germans attack the British heavily on the airwaves, but they don't really know what they mean. This only angers the British. For example, a German radio station was broadcasting an American song very well, and the audience was enjoying it when, suddenly, the broadcaster's voice inserted, saying: "Today our topic is Germany's enemy, the root of Britain's woes -- Churchill!" Then he greatly mocked Churchill.</p>
<p>The Berlin broadcasters come from various nationalities and broadcast "news" to the world in various languages. An Egyptian named Fakhousa was captured by the Germans at the beginning of the war. The German army told him that he could broadcast propaganda in Arabic or be confined to a prisoner-of-war camp. He naturally wanted to take on the broadcasting job. Known as the "Noble Indian," when he officially broadcasts about Britain's cruel colonial policies, one can often detect a rare Prussian accent. An unnamed "American doctor," who, it is claimed, "just came from Poland," describes the prosperity there on the radio. Captured British soldiers and airmen—some real, some fake—often promote to their hometowns on the airwaves that German prisoner-of-war camps are better than high-end hotels. An American broadcaster discovered that these so-called German "prisoners" often appeared near the radio station.</p>
<p>The most outstanding character in the radio broadcasting war has to be Lord Haw-Haw, who promotes Germany. The British enjoy listening to this aristocratic broadcaster with his calm tone and pleasant elocution more than any foreign program. The London broadcasting community imitated this "Haw-Haw," which was once all the rage. At first, the authorities did not pay attention, but now, apart from broadcasting a set of "How to listen to German propaganda," they are at a loss. In addition to broadcasting so-called "news," Haw-Haw often mocks the British government. Regarding (1) food distribution, he said to the British, "This fully represents your penny-pinching government. Therefore, your meat allocation is based on price -- a limit of one shilling and ten pence a week, unlike Germany, which distributes based on quantity." (2) On evacuating the population, he said, "What right does your government have to separate you from your husband? After you leave the city safely, do you know what your husband is doing now?" He also said to the workers: "British workers, you don't need to worry. The German leader knows very well that it is the British gentlemen who started this war, and they are using you as cannon fodder." Ordinary workers feel very indignant when they hear this kind of propaganda and wanted to fight Hitler before Chamberlain.</p>
<p>Lord Haw-Haw is actually a pseudonym for William Joyce, who was originally a subordinate of the British political leader Mosley. After leaving, he founded the Nazi Fascist Party himself. He then ran off to Germany because of economic problems. Now he is the highest-paid "foreign" broadcaster in Germany, earning as much as (U.S. dollars) sixty dollars a week. German radio plays often broadcast the peaceful atmosphere under Hitler's rule from the airwaves. From the radio, you can hear a butcher in Hamburg talking to his customers, saying that all kinds of meat are fully stocked, and there is nothing you can't buy if you can name it. The Germans do not seem to find this contradictory. An hour later, there seem to be the cries of babies and the weeping of women, proving that the British blockade is inhumane.</p>
<p>Not long ago, Lord Haw-Haw staged another radio drama called "Lloyd's of London." Lloyd's famous "Lutine Bell" rings from time to time, indicating a warning to insurers that ships are sinking one after another. The British can only laugh at this kind of practice. Originally, this "Lutine Bell" does not necessarily ring when a ship sinks. It is only used when special news occurs, such as when there is no news of a ship arriving for a long time, and then its whereabouts are known, so the bell is rung to notify everyone.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Revises New Methods to Improve National People's Education Centers</h3>
<p>(Chongqing Airmail News) The People's Education Center is the central location for the implementation of social education. It is responsible for the implementation of mass education, the improvement of cultural standards, assistance in mass organization and training, the promotion of local autonomy, the guidance of recreational activities, the promotion of mass livelihood and side businesses, the propaganda of party doctrine and government decrees, and the organization of other social education work. Since the Anti-Japanese War, all localities have deeply felt the importance of social education, but there are still many who have not been able to do their best to rectify and enrich it, either because funds have not been generously raised, or because offices have not been assisted, or because talent evaluation has not been appropriate, or because work assessment has not been strict, so that each center still has an empty name without achieving practical results. In view of this, the Ministry of Education revised the Regulations on People's Education Centers and the Work Outline, Guidance Methods, etc. in April and May of the 28th year to ensure that the equipment is enriched, the organization is sound, and the personnel selection is appropriate. The work should be developed, and it is feared that the law alone is not enough to implement it. It is ordered to establish a class to train the directors of people's education centers in each county across the country. At the time of the implementation of the county-level organization outline and the renewal of political affairs, the Ministry then listed eight things and ordered the directors of education in each province to supervise their subordinates, pay close attention to the implementation. This method has comprehensive regulations for personnel, so that the people's education centers in each province can be effectively improved.</p>

<h3>He Tianjian Organizes Three Summer Vacation Training Classes in Chinese Painting</h3>
<p>The famous painter He Tianjian has been selling paintings in Shanghai for nearly 30 years and has long been famous in the art world. He Tianjian, in view of the decline of Chinese painting, had long planned to hold solo exhibitions in North China and South China to promote national essence. Several years ago, he held an exhibition of hundreds of works in Beiping, which were all sold out in less than three days. Later, he planned to continue opening a solo exhibition in Hong Kong, but it has not been successful to this day. Those who seek his paintings over the years are very numerous. He Tianjian, in the midst of his busy schedule, still does not forget his long-standing aspiration to promote Chinese painting, so he takes time to teach Chinese painting, willing to pass on his life's learning to his students. In the past few years, his students have been all over the world. It is reported that he has now added summer vacation training classes, located at 1283 Lafayette Road.</p>

<h3>International Cup Table Tennis A Group: Qingyun A Lodges Protest</h3>
<p>In the International Cup Table Tennis A Group, Qingyun A and Youbang tied for first place with ten wins and one loss each. Due to the scoring record, Youbang was judged to be the champion. Upon hearing this, Qingyun A expressed extreme dissatisfaction, refused to accept the runner-up award, and submitted a written protest to the association, listing three reasons: (1) The notification letter for the match between our team and the Jewish Association was mistakenly sent to the address of the Sino-French Band Team, resulting in failure to arrive at the venue for the competition (previously, notification letters were sent to team leader Lu Hanjun), so the one point lost should be the responsibility of the association. (2) Since the scores of the two teams are equal, the championship should be re-determined. How can the first and second seats be judged based on the scoring record? The association did not announce this method beforehand, so it is difficult to accept. (3) Our team played against the Russian army earlier, and the Russian army temporarily requested a postponement at the team's ball room. The association actually approved the request, so the match between our team and the Jewish team can also be considered for postponement.</p>

<h3>British Troops in Shanghai Not Being Transferred - British Far East Policy Remains Unchanged - Strict Coastal Defense Checks Lead to Sluggish Cargo Traffic - Hong Kong Situation Affects Local Finance</h3>
<p>According to yesterday's news report, a Reuters dispatch from London stated that British officials indicated the UK would transfer a small number of defense troops in Shanghai to Hong Kong. Yesterday, a reporter from Da Zhong News Agency specifically visited a British official to inquire about the truth. According to the official, there was no formal order from London, so it was not credible. However, "I can definitely say that the UK's Far East policy remains the same and has not changed." According to foreign sources, officials at the British military base in this city refused to comment on the rumored transfer of British troops stationed in China to Hong Kong in the near future, only stating that the information they had was already in the newspapers. According to diplomatic sources, British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr has met with many of the country's military and political officials stationed in China since this week. In addition, several influential British expatriates have also had audiences. The commander of the British garrison in Shanghai, Major General Simmons, also met with the British ambassador on the morning of the 2nd (yesterday). Major General Simmons had previously been injured in a horse riding accident and is now recovering.</p>
<p>The Local Financial Market Was Affected Yesterday</p>
<p>Since the situation in Hong Kong suddenly became tense, the local financial market had no immediate reaction due to the biannual financial industry holiday at the end of June. However, the financial market opened yesterday. Yesterday morning, it was generally expected that there would be significant changes. The only reason for this change was the general perception that the situation in Hong Kong was indeed extremely tense, with the risk of cargo traffic between here and Free China being cut off. According to reports, the value of goods stranded in Hong Kong is around 10 million yuan. Except for rice and coal, which can still be purchased from Annam at a higher value, other goods are severely restricted, leading to price increases. The reason for the price increase is that people are hoarding in preparation for future shortages. Other cargo traffic is affected by military factors, and it is said that all ships have already been reserved.</p>
<p>Chinese in Annam Flee in Large Numbers</p>
<p>The Times reported that, according to those arriving in Shanghai from the Annam coast, the Japanese naval power in the Gulf of Tonkin is increasing significantly and intensifying its activities. Japanese troops are gathering in Hainan Island, seemingly in larger numbers. Customs authorities, as a precaution, are strictly inspecting all travelers and issuing warnings. Travelers with any suspicion are immediately arrested. Chinese residing in Annam, seeing the tense situation in Annam, are planning to relocate to a better place, fleeing to Singapore and then to South China.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Coastal Defense Cargo Suddenly Sluggish</p>
<p>Affected by rumors, cargo traffic on the Shanghai-Hong Kong coastal defense route has suddenly become sluggish. Jardine Matheson's Taishing is scheduled to leave Shanghai today for Hong Kong coastal defense. The Sichuan is rescheduled to depart from Shanghai for Xiamen tomorrow (5th), via Hong Kong, Guangzhou Bay, Haikou, and then to Haiphong. Jardine Matheson's Glen Line, originally scheduled to sail to Hong Kong today, has been rescheduled to Bangkok due to the lack of passengers and cargo. Java Company's Geneva, departing today, is going to Xiamen via Hong Kong, Little Luzon, and returning to Surabaya. There is not much cargo from Hong Kong, but there are still many passengers.</p>
<p>If Britain Yields, the Far East Will Suffer</p>
<p>An editorial in the English-language China Review newspaper stated that the authorities in Hong Kong and Vietnam have ordered the evacuation of women and children from those two locations, and the crisis in South China is just beginning. The publication criticized Japan for seeking excuses to undermine agreements with British authorities in Hong Kong and advocated for complete freedom of action. The publication stated that if the British yield to Japan, not only will the British themselves suffer a fatal blow, but all countries with interests in the Far East will suffer as well.</p>
<p>Japanese Publications Criticize Britain</p>
<p>A special dispatch from Tokyo on July 3rd in the North-China Daily News said that Tokyo newspapers and magazines are publishing texts about the South Seas in a prominent position. "Miyako Shimbun" published a full page of photos and maps of Burma in the evening edition, strongly arguing for the close connection between Burma and Vietnam. A mass meeting was recently held in the Tokyo Public Hall, where many people gave speeches about the South Seas, denouncing Britain as an enemy of Japan. As for the evacuation of women and children from Hong Kong, the Japanese believe that it is due to the Hong Kong authorities' concerns about possible friction caused by Japanese military actions near Hong Kong. It is generally believed that the tense situation there can be overcome without any unexpected incidents. The Japanese have raised concerns about Burma and Hong Kong being supply routes for Chongqing. British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, said that Britain needed more time to consider the matter, which made the Japanese feel resentful and believe that the British ambassador made this statement after consulting with the United States. However, the Japanese are confident that Britain will assure Japan that war supplies will no longer be transported to Chongqing via Hong Kong and Burma.</p>
<h3>Yu Hongjun Protests the Transfer of Land Bureau Documents - Violates Agreements and Greatly Harms Property Owners' Interests</h3>
<p>Reuters, Chongqing, July 3rd: Former Shanghai Mayor Yu Hongjun, upon hearing that the Shanghai Municipal Council had resolved to hand over the Land Bureau documents, previously entrusted to the Council by the former Greater Shanghai Municipal Government, to Fu Xiao'an, sent a telegram to the Municipal Council today, lodging a serious protest. The telegram stated that the Council's action was a violation of the agreement and greatly harmed the interests of property owners in Shanghai, both Chinese and foreign. Therefore, he requested the Municipal Council to reconsider its decision.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's official trusteeship of the Land Bureau documents from the Chinese government seems inevitably creating a loss of sympathy from both Chinese and foreigners by handing them over to a puppet regime not recognized by any country. According to a Japanese Embassy spokesman at a press conference last night, Municipal Council Secretary-General Phillips visited Miura, the Japanese Consul-General, at 2:30 PM yesterday to propose handing over the Land Bureau documents to the Japanese Consul-General. The Japanese Consul-General accepted the proposal and will complete the handover procedures tomorrow. Furthermore, according to yesterday's English-language China Press, the transfer of the Land Bureau documents by the Municipal Council will take place on the morning of the 5th. The Municipal Council will first hand over the documents to Japanese Consul-General Miura, who will then transfer them to the "Municipal Land Bureau." It is said that Xiao'an claimed that the "return" of the Land Bureau documents has paved the way for resolving the issue of road construction beyond the Settlement boundaries. It is said that there are three reasons affecting the implementation of the road construction beyond the Settlement boundaries "agreement": the "Special Police Force" issue, the tax and court issues, and the Land Bureau documents issue. Now that the Municipal Council has handed over the Land Bureau documents, there will be no changes in the puppet regime's management of the files, and everything will "proceed as usual."</p>
<h3>Song Ziwen's Mission to the United States - Highly Valued by All Parties - Financial Reputation Praised by the U.S. - Expected to Negotiate and Achieve Success</h3>
<p>Mr. Song Ziwen, the Chinese financier who is carrying a major mission to the United States, has recently arrived in the United States and has begun discussions with American officials and the financial and trade sectors. All parties value his mission highly. Mr. Song was also ordered to go to the United States ten years ago to negotiate financial loans and achieved great success. When he returned to China, the people of Shanghai gave him a warm welcome. Mr. Song's second trip to the United States coincides with the third year of China's war of resistance against Japan, which is gradually approaching the final victory stage. At the same time, due to the European war, the situation in the Far East is unprecedentedly tense. Therefore, Mr. Song's trip is not only about purely Chinese financial issues but is actually related to the entire Far Eastern situation. It is expected that Mr. Song's mission to the United States will be to request the United States to provide new credit loans to assist China, urge the United States to pay attention to the overall situation in the Far East, and address the issue of rerouting Sino-US cargo traffic in the event of a blockade of Vietnam. Chinese officials here believe that Mr. Song's financial reputation has always been praised by the U.S. government and people, and they expect him to work hard to negotiate and achieve great success.</p>
<h3>French Concession Ratepayers Association - Again Blocks Tax Increase - French Municipal Council Will Respond Soon</h3>
<p>Regarding the French Concession's increase of land tax to 0.3%, house tax to 7%, and other miscellaneous taxes to 50%, the Chinese Ratepayers Association previously sent a letter to the French Municipal Council requesting that the increase be suspended, but it was politely rejected. The Association sent another letter to the Municipal Council on the 30th of last month, stating that the French Concession has always had a surplus in its financial revenue and expenditure over the years. At this difficult time, the increase in taxes is unbearable for the citizens. Please reconsider, etc. Many days have passed since this letter was sent, and the French Municipal Council has not yet responded. A reporter from Da Zhong News Agency asked the French authorities about this matter yesterday. According to them, the reply is currently being drafted and will generally be based on Announcement No. 218 of the French Consulate General in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Shanghai's American Community Celebrates American Independence Today - Flag-Raising Ceremony This Morning - Review of the 4th Marine Regiment</h3>

<p>From 12:30 PM to 2:00 PM, but only those who have been invited can attend. (Address: 209 Fuzhou Road.) The Shanghai Municipal Police Department has specially stipulated temporary traffic measures.

<h3>North Henan Road - Yesterday's Situation</h3>
<p>Cross-Streets Not Blocked - Resumption of Trolley Services In Sight</p>
<p>After the Japanese suddenly and completely removed the continuous iron wire and wooden frames that they had placed in North Jiangxi Road last summer, they started moving their defense lines westwards on the 2nd (the day before yesterday), extending to the east side of North Henan Road. They also erected six checkpoints along this line, from the northern end of Tianhou Temple Bridge in the south to the entrance of the Delong Tobacco Factory on Bazijie Road in the north. Further, they used small iron wire and wooden frames to block three alleys on the east side of North Henan Road. Details were in yesterday's issue of this newspaper. When the Japanese engineering team began deploying defenses the day before yesterday, they initially intended to choose the most congested intersections of the roads running east and west along North Henan Road and still block them with iron wire and wooden frames. They had already transported and piled up the iron wire piles and other materials needed for this purpose. However, when the reporter made a special inspection trip along North Henan Road yesterday morning, the aforementioned barrier materials had all been moved away. The Tram Company believes that since the roads through which trams pass in the northern district are generally unobstructed by wire netting, and in order to facilitate residents and develop transportation, it has heard that it will request the authorities to negotiate with the Japanese to restore the routes of all trolley cars, both rail-bound and trackless, that formerly ran in the district. Currently, since the Japanese have already lifted restrictions on entering and exiting the area east of their defense line, it is expected that this point may be easily resolved. As for the issue of police authority in the district, there seems to have been no developments recently. Patrolmen only patrol to the iron wire wooden frames that have been removed from North Jiangxi Road. Although their defense line has been extended westward by dozens of yards, the patrol endpoint has not retreated an inch.</p>
<h3>Grain and Rice Evaluation Committee - To Be Established Tomorrow - Rice Merchants to Visit Authorities Again This Morning</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Soybean &amp; Rice Trade Association, together with the Miscellaneous Grains and Oilseed Cake Industry, convened a joint meeting of executive and supervisory committee members on the 2nd of this month. As a result of the discussion, the Grain and Rice Evaluation Committee is scheduled to convene its inaugural meeting tomorrow, and it has been decided that members from the Soybean &amp; Rice Trade, the Miscellaneous Grains Industry, the Rice Shop Industry, the Southern Gang, the Changbang Rice Guild, the Rice Milling Industry, the Distribution Industry, the Rice Market Management Committee, the Shanghai Northern Rice Merchants United Benefit Association, the Chaozhou Sugar Guild, Shen Shou Tang, Zhi Cheng Tang, Ji Yuan Tang, etc., will be invited, as well as representatives from the City Chamber of Commerce and the two Settlement authorities. The association has already appointed committee members Chen Ziyi, Zhu Zixiang, and Zhang Nianxuan to visit the authorities again at 10:00 this morning, in addition to reporting the progress of industry consultations, and will personally invite representatives to participate in the Evaluation Committee and provide guidance. As for the City Chamber of Commerce, it has already sent a letter to notify</p>
<p>Rice Prices</p>
<p>In recent days, due to the tense situation in Hong Kong and the stagnation of Shanghai-Hong Kong shipping, the source of tribute rice has been affected to varying degrees. General rice merchants have even claimed that there is a shortage of supply, invisibly raising market prices. The authorities specifically ordered the Soybean and Rice Trade Association to quickly find a way to suppress rice prices the day before yesterday. All rice market transactions must not exceed the closing market price on June 29. Those who violate will be severely punished. The market price rose by two yuan the day before yesterday. The authorities are currently investigating and will punish those responsible. The rice shops and market opened as usual at 7:30 yesterday morning, and all goods were stationed at their original locations.</p>
<p>Flat Price Rice</p>
<p>The Shanghai Flat Price Rice Committee recently resolved that the fourth phase of flat price rice will be implemented starting on the 16th of this month and will continue to entrust 60 members of the Shanghai Rice Shop Trade Association from the two Settlements to handle it, including 30 who sell tickets and 30 who distribute rice. The association has scheduled a joint meeting of executive and supervisory committee members for 3:00 PM on the 8th of this month to discuss the specific flat price rice measures. It is expected that the common people buying rice this time will be very crowded, so it is hoped that the police authorities of the two Settlements will dispatch a large number of detectives to rush to each flat price rice distribution point to protect and maintain order, so as to avoid various disputes. The rise in rice prices has made it difficult for the generally poorer people to make a living, so suppressing rice prices is an urgent task.</p>
<h3>The Two Settlements Take Unified Steps - Protecting Law-Abiding Citizens - "Wanted Orders" Dismissed as Rumors</h3>
<p>According to a newspaper report, Wang Jingwei has issued "wanted orders" for 83 people he despises, including newspaper reporters, bankers, lawyers, Municipal Council officials, and customs officials. After this was reported in the newspaper, a Western reporter visited a senior official of the Municipal Police Department and was resolutely told that he could guarantee that Wang Jingwei would not be able to obtain the cooperation of the police authorities here to realize his intentions, and that all those "wanted" are among the most hardworking in their posts, and at the very least, they are all law-abiding citizens. A reporter from Da Zhong News Agency received reliable information yesterday morning that the views of the French Concession police authorities are completely consistent with those of the Public Concession, and it is known that the matter has been contacted with the Public Concession police authorities. Both parties have decided to take unified steps. In order to verify this news, the reporter visited a senior French official yesterday afternoon to inquire whether the information obtained by the reporter was reliable and to request his attitude. According to him, the French side has not received any notification from any party regarding this matter. The "wanted order" is only seen in newspapers, and we only regard it as a rumor. He solemnly stated that the French Concession authorities will give full protection to all law-abiding people of all countries within the Concession.</p>
<h3>Post Office Launches Airmail to Europe Via the United States</h3>
<p>Since the expansion of the European War, the Eurasian air route has been blocked. Now, according to the Post Office's announcement, it is launching airmail to Europe via the United States. This mail is shipped from Hong Kong on Pan American Airlines to San Francisco, then transported by continental airmail to New York, and then transferred to Clipper flying boats across the Atlantic to Europe. In addition to the ordinary airmail postage of 50 cents per 20 centimeters, an additional 5 yuan and 40 cents is charged for every 5 centimeters. The entire journey takes only 15 days. However, mail must be marked on the envelope,</p>
<h3>The City Federation of Trade Unions Sends a Telegram of Condolences to Air Force Soldiers - And Encourages the Citizens of Chongqing to Work Hard for the Country</h3>

We especially send a telegram to express our condolences and wish you all hard work for the country. Shanghai City Federation of Trade Unions kowtows, Jiang."</p>

<h3>Cost of Living Index for June - Rice Prices Rise Most Sharply - Speculators Take Advantage of Psychology and the Situation - Purchasing Power of Currency Decreases by Another 2.5%</h3>
<p>The cost of living index and retail prices for workers in Shanghai in June 1940 are as follows: General wholesale prices tended to decline this month, and foreign exchange also eased, but the cost of living index for workers still rose quite sharply. The index for this month is 422.91, an increase of 40 points from last month, or 10.45%, breaking the previous high of 382.91 in May. Among the classified indexes, the increase in food was the most severe. The index for May was 383.24, and it rose sharply to 451.74 in June. The increase in miscellaneous items was very small, and there was a significant decrease in clothing. The index for May was 403.85, and it was only 360.00 in June. The fuel index only fell by 2.59%. If the price of briquettes had not risen in the second half of June, the fall would have been even greater. The purchasing power of currency decreased by another 2.5% this month, to 23.65 cents.</p>
<p>Soaring Rice Prices</p>
<p>The rise in the June index is largely due to the sharp rise in rice prices. The price of premium japonica rice reached 74.5 yuan per shi on the 20th, which is an unprecedentedly high price in this city. The average price of No. 1 japonica rice in June was 60.39 yuan per shi, a sharp increase of 29.48% from May. No. 2 Saigon rice was 55.95 yuan, up 16.77%. The reasons for the increase are: (1) Rice prices inevitably rise during the period between harvests; (2) The prolonged drought affects the autumn harvest; (3) Rice prices are expensive in Ningbo, Shaoxing and other places, stimulating prices in this city; (4) Flour production is reduced due to the control of wheat; (5) A large quantity of military rice is purchased in the production areas; (6) Vietnam is the source of rice and coal, and the tense situation affects rice prices; (7) Citizens hoard large quantities of rice in view of the daily increase in rice prices. However, this is still far from the period between harvests, and it is the yellow plum rainy season. The rainy season started on June 12 and ended on July 15 this year. There was rain around June 14, and there was even more rain from the 23rd to the end of the month. According to the Xujiahui Observatory report, there was a total of 3.5 inches of rain throughout the month. In addition, there is sufficient grain storage, the source has not been cut off, and a large amount of Vietnamese rice has been ordered. Moreover, general wholesale prices have fallen this month, and foreign exchange is more relaxed than in May. Therefore, the rise in rice prices is inconsistent with the general trend of prices. The reason for this serious situation is nothing more than speculators taking advantage of psychology and the situation. It is hoped that the general public will not purchase large quantities of rice other than what is needed when prices rise sharply, then the rumors will subside, and prices will fall.</p>
<p>Fuel Has Not Fallen</p>
<p>As for briquettes, the price reached 8 yuan per dan around the 20th of this month. Since May, the price of briquette raw materials has increased instantly when the exchange rate for the U.S. dollar shrank sharply at the beginning of last month, calculated in U.S. dollars. This month, the exchange rate is extremely relaxed, but there is no sign of a corresponding price decrease. This city has the most sufficient coal storage, and the source has not been cut off. Even if the situation in Vietnam is tense, why would the price rise immediately? In short, rice, briquettes, and rent are the three most important things for the livelihoods of citizens. If all three rise, all things will inevitably become more expensive. Therefore, if we want prices to fall, we should first suppress the prices of these three, then the citizens will have a chance to recover.</p>
<h3>Since Using Mianli... ○</h3>
<p>— Chen Lijuan</p>
<p>Mianli, Mianli. My classmates are all clamoring for this familiar name. Sister Lan has to apply it in front of the mirror every morning. A subtle, quiet Mianli fragrance lingers around. I am captivated. Xue specially rushed to the Tongren Pharmacy after class today to buy a bottle. She even showed off its benefits to me. Hui also praised the effectiveness of Mianli. So it moved me to change my mind and use Mianli. When I tried Mianli for the first time, I felt that the powder was fine and smooth, moisturizing but not greasy. When applied to the face, it is smooth and white. I no longer need to apply other scented powders. Moreover, most scented powders contain lead, which only damages the skin, making it dull, yellow, and rough. So since I started using Mianli, all scented powders and all types of snow powders have been discarded. The fragrance of Mianli, as far as I know, is a subtle floral fragrance. But Sister Lan says it smells a bit like milk. How can Mianli use milk? I don't think so. If it really uses milk, wouldn't that be great for nourishing the body and the skin? I don't know if Mianli uses milk. But Mianli does have the great effects of milk. Since I started using Mianli, the most significant effect is that my skin has a crystal clear color, vibrant and radiant, like newly glazed porcelain, like fresh flowers in the dew. I used to use makeup because my skin was pale and rough before applying makeup. If I didn't add some makeup, I couldn't even see people. Now it's better. These problems are gone. And the large pores have shrunk. So my skin is much more delicate. At the same time, I received a report from Xue that her freckles have also been cured. Overjoyed, I wrote a few words to thank the inventor of Mianli.</p>
<h3>British Territories Spare No Effort to Assist Britain in the War; Canada, Australia, and Others Implement Conscription and Intensify Munitions Production to Steadily Support Britain</h3>
<p>According to an American recently arrived in Shanghai from the Philippines, Britain's situation is indeed more serious than before due to the capitulation of its ally France. However, fortunately, in this severe situation, the various territories of the empire not only remain loyal to the mother country but also spare no effort to assist Britain.</p>
<p>Canada Has Expedited Munitions Production</p>
<p>For example, the Canadian government has recently instructed munitions factories, shipyards, and aircraft factories across the country to work day and night shifts, abolishing all holidays, in order to increase production. The number of bullet factories has increased from eight to fourteen. With regard to infantry, in light of the current situation in Europe, training is being intensified, with plans to establish a fourth division. The quota of 5,000 reserve air force pilots has also been conscripted and training has begun immediately.</p>
<p>Australia Formulates Conscription Regulations</p>
<p>In Australia, aircraft factories and munitions factories are working in shifts, each shift lasting twelve hours. All work is under the direction of one person, with the aim of increasing production so as to obtain the maximum output in the shortest possible time. The Australian government has recently loaned £20 million to Britain. Conscription regulations have been formulated, and all conscripted recruits are concentrated in large venues across the country. However, due to the shortage of housing, a considerable number of recruits can only temporarily reside at home and receive training according to a set schedule. Consequently, training facilities are distributed throughout various locations. Australia is not paying much attention to its own defense, as the urgency of the situation compared to the European front is self-evident. Aircraft ordered by Australia from the United States have all been rerouted to Britain, and trained air force personnel serving in Australia will also be sent to Europe. In total, Australia has more than 84,000 air force personnel, including 14,000 pilots and 70,000 service personnel.</p>
<p>New Zealand Forms Wartime Parliament</p>
<p>New Zealand has recently established a unified wartime parliament of all parties. The parliament has recently enacted a law similar to that in Britain, stipulating that the lives and property of all people shall be subject to the government. In addition, New Zealand is steadily exporting cotton, wool, meat, and other commodities useful to the mother country to Britain. In Africa, local authorities have recently been authorized to requisition at any time any houses, open spaces, food supplies, means of transportation, and other properties that are beneficial to defense. India has organized and dispatched 100,000 new troops, and the number of air force personnel has quadrupled. Even British citizens in India are being conscripted and deployed. As for munitions production, it has increased twelvefold compared to when the war broke out.</p>
<h3>Fake Police Arrest People in Yue Opera Theater</h3>
<p>At around 8:00 PM last night, while a Yue opera performance was underway at a certain Yue opera theater located at 1151 Avenue Haig, French Concession, suddenly dozens of fake police officers barged in. The audience, witnessing the entry of the fake police, became extremely frightened and rushed out, causing chaos. After entering, the fake police, without asking any questions, went straight to the backstage of the theater and arrested two staff members: Zhang Wenrong, a native of Shaoxing, and a Mr. Liu. They were taken to the fake police station inside Jiaotong University. The French Concession police received a report and dispatched a large number of detectives to the scene, but all the fake police officers had already dispersed. The police conducted a thorough investigation. The reason for the arrest of the two staff members is currently under investigation by the police.</p>
<h3>Abduction of Du Xuexuan; Rickshaw Puller Highly Suspected; Origins of the Car Used by the Abductors Ascertained; Car Driven to a Gambling Den, Whereabouts Unknown</h3>
<p>Du Xuexuan, manager of the Datong Silver Company at 280 Beijing Road, resided at No. 1, Lane 672, Hart Road. At 9:15 AM on the morning of the day before yesterday, Du left home, intending to take the No. 10 bus on Connaught Road to go to the company to handle business. However, just as he stepped out of the lane entrance, he was suddenly</p>
<p>abducted by four kidnappers who forced him into a car that had been waiting by the roadside and sped away. Du's family reported the incident to the Gordon Road police station, and Chinese detective Xie Zhiguang was dispatched to investigate. According to Du's family, they had not received any threatening letters beforehand. Subsequently, it was discovered that the license plate number of the car hired by the gang was 17945, belonging to the Xinzha Motor Company. The police then located the driver of the car, Zhou Chaoliang, who claimed that he had received a phone call from the</p>
<p>Rongsheng Gambling Den on Yananping Road (now renamed "Shanghai General Association") to hire a car. After driving there, four people got into the car and first went to the Museum Road, then to the scene of the incident. The four people got out of the car, and another person got in. They then drove to the entrance of the Rongsheng Gambling Den, where they got out. At that time, they entered the Rongsheng and paid the fare of three yuan. The detectives believed that since Zhou had encountered such an incident, he should have immediately reported it to the police station. However, Zhou did not do so, and the police had to search for him for a long time before finding him. Therefore, Zhou was suspected of</p>
<p>collusion and was taken into custody. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Third Criminal Court of the Special No. 1 District Court. The police lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, explained the case, stating that since the victim had not yet been found, he requested permission to detain Zhou temporarily and reschedule the hearing. Judge Liu reviewed the report and ordered Zhou to be detained pending a rescheduled hearing.</p>
<h3>After the Death of Shao Xubai; The Funeral Will Be Held Today</h3>
<p>All Circles Mourn with Utmost Solemnity; The Municipal Federation of Trade Unions Cables Requesting the Arrest of the Murderers</p>
<p>Mr. Shao Xubai, president of the Daguang News Agency, unfortunately met with a tragic death on the evening of the first day of the month. His remains have been moved to the Shanghai Funeral Home. Yesterday, Chinese and foreign friends visited to pay their respects in an endless stream. The details are described below:</p>
<p>The Funeral Will Be Held Today</p>
<p>After Shao's death, as a result of severe injuries, his remains were moved to the Shanghai Funeral Home on Xujiahui Road. The family has decided to hold the funeral at the funeral home at 10:00 AM today (the 4th). It is expected that there will be a large procession of plain cars and white horses, demonstrating utmost solemnity.</p>
<p>Mourning from All Circles</p>
<p>Since learning of the tragic news, the Chinese and Western press circles in Shanghai and Shao's friends visited the Shanghai Funeral Home to pay their respects. Yesterday, six foreign reporters and more than fifty people from the press, business circles, and Shao's friends visited to pay their respects and view the remains.</p>
<p>Cables Requesting the Arrest of the Murderers</p>
<p>The Municipal Federation of Trade Unions specially cabled the central government yesterday, requesting the arrest of the murderers and the provision of preferential treatment. The cable reads: "To the Central Party Headquarters in Chongqing: Comrade Shao Suibai, a member of our federation, dedicated himself to the revolution and wholeheartedly supported the national policy of resistance and reconstruction, which incurred the jealousy of certain parties. He was assassinated by thugs on the first day of the month, and the shocking news has spread throughout the city. We implore your esteemed department to forward this to the police authorities, to strictly arrest the perpetrators, bring them to justice, and provide preferential treatment to honor the laws of the nation and comfort the loyal soul. The Shanghai Municipal Federation of Trade Unions bows in respect, Jiang Yin."</p>
<p>Condolences to the Family</p>
<p>"To Mrs. Shao Xubai, the wife of Committee Member Xubai: We were shocked and saddened to learn of Mr. Xubai's assassination by thugs. We believe that Mr. Xubai dedicated himself to the revolution and contributed to the party and the nation. He sought benevolence and obtained it, so he can have no regrets. In addition to cabling the central government to strictly arrest the perpetrators and provide preferential treatment to comfort the loyal soul, we also pray that you restrain your grief and carry on the great cause. The Shanghai Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and all executive and supervisory committee members bow in respect."</p>
<h3>The Closing of the Five-Religion Lecture; The Meritorious Work is Completed with Excellent Results; The Imam of Islam Advocates a Grand Union of the Five Religions</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the last day of the Five-Religion Lecture. Mr. Jiang Zhuzhuang lectured on the essentials of Buddhism and its practice. The number of attendees was even greater than in the previous four days. In addition to the seats that were temporarily added on the previous two days, another hundred or so seats were added, but it still felt insufficient. This shows that the public's interest in religion is deeper than initially expected. Jiang's lecture covered the doctrines of Buddhism, believing that all things in the world are due to cause and condition. Cause and condition lead to result. For example, sowing rice seeds is the cause, and adding artificial cultivation and the nourishment of timely rain and dew is the condition. The sowing of the cause and the meeting of the condition lead to the result of bearing fruit as grain. Therefore, creating good causes and forming good conditions leads to good results, and creating bad causes and forming bad conditions leads to bad results. The birth and death of people is also the same principle. It is also said that all forms are born from the mind, so one should seek to remove the deluded mind and seek the true mind. He also explained the process of Sakyamuni's cultivation to become a Buddha and the passing down of scriptures, explaining the Six Paramitas, the Five Precepts, the Greater and Lesser Vehicles, and various sects in great detail. Afterwards, Mr. Feng Bingnan's fourth son, Zhenwei, delivered the closing address, stating that this Five-Religion Lecture was like sowing the seeds of goodness. He hoped that these seeds could gradually sprout, develop, blossom, and bear fruit, and that the fruit could then be sown again, from one to ten, from ten to a hundred, from a hundred to a thousand, and from a thousand to ten thousand, spreading throughout the universe, so that all mankind could advance to the utmost good. The Buddha's teachings are vast and boundless, and the will of man is also vast and boundless. With the vast aspirations and vast power of millions of people, seeking the improvement of all mankind, sincerity is enough to move heaven, earth, ghosts, and gods, let alone mankind. He dares to believe that there will be a day when it will be achieved. Only in this way will the holding of the Five-Religion Lecture not be in vain. He then recounted the social welfare enterprise initiated by his esteemed father, saying that the scale of the enterprise is relatively large and the work is relatively heavy. It cannot be undertaken by the power of one person alone, and it is even more necessary to rely on the collective wisdom and efforts of people from all walks of life in order to achieve success. His father felt that there were many areas in society that needed improvement from a young age, so starting twenty or thirty years ago, he saved a portion of his annual income each year to prepare for the future establishment of social welfare enterprises. Therefore, since the August 13th Incident, his assets have been almost completely depleted, but he has not touched a single cent of the funds saved for the social enterprise. Several of his friends, who had been deeply helped by his esteemed father in business, repeatedly offered large sums of money as compensation, but his esteemed father never accepted a single cent. Upon hearing of the initiation of the social welfare enterprise and the difficulty of limited capacity, they offered their full support, so the social welfare enterprise was able to take shape and begin planning. What his esteemed father bears is only a quarter or a fifth of the existing funds of the society. These several friends who provided support did good deeds without wanting to be known, so their names are not yet convenient to announce. He also said that although the social welfare enterprise has some subsidy regulations, the subsidies are limited to those who can help themselves and need assistance from others. If they cannot help themselves and hope to gain without labor, then the society dare not sympathize with them and encourage laziness. At the time of the closing ceremony, Mr. Xue Ziming, the Imam of the Shanghai Fuyou Road Mosque and the President of the Shanghai Islamic Scripture Research Society, was invited to express his views. Due to the limited time, he gave only a brief five-minute speech, using the analogy of a large family with five brothers, each engaged in their own business and not consulting with each other, each affirming their own views and not tolerating others. As a result, there was a great deal of friction within the family. Fortunately, an old man summoned them and told them the principles of cooperation and harmony, and from then on they became harmonious and the family was at peace. These five brothers are the five religions of Confucianism, Buddhism, Taoism, Christianity, and Islam, and the one who summoned them with the principles of cooperation and harmony was Mr. Feng Bingnan. He deeply hoped that from today onwards, the five religions of Confucianism, Buddhism, Taoism, Christianity, and Islam would form a grand alliance to seek the peace of the family, etc.</p>
<h3>A Dismissed Police Detective Colludes with Bandits; Abducts a Coal Broker; Initiated the Plot After Extorting Coal Company Failed; Six Criminals Arrested and the Hostage Rescued</h3>
<p>The Rongyu Coal Company at No. 2, Lane 475, Pushi Road, has a strong capital. At 6:30 AM on the morning of the 30th of this month, six kidnappers suddenly came to the coal company and abducted the Ningbo broker Jiang Beihai. Afterwards, they sent a letter demanding a ransom of 4,000 yuan and designated the Wugong Hotel at the intersection of Simar Road and Shilu as the place to negotiate. The victim reported the letter to the French police station, and the police chief dispatched detectives to</p>
<p>do their best to investigate. They learned that the bandits' den was on North Sichuan Road. They then coordinated with the Japanese Command in Hongkou and went to the address, where they arrested on the spot Bu Guangquan (24 years old this year), a Zhenjiang native who had previously served as a detective in the French police station. They also confiscated two pistols and rescued the hostage Jiang Beihai from danger. Based on Bu's confession, the police continued to apprehend five accomplices: Hao Jinlin, Fang Donglin, Jiang Guiqing, Wang Ahua, and Jiang Yongjin, all natives of Ningbo. Details have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, all the criminals were escorted to the First Criminal Court of the Special No. 2 District Court. The police lawyer, Fei Xizhen, requested a postponement because the administrative authorities</p>
<p>had not yet completed the investigation. According to the report of the investigating detectives, the cause of the case was that Fang Donglin, Jiang Guiqing, and Wang Ahua, all of whom were workers at the coal company, learned that Rongyu Company had made a great profit this year. Jiang Yongjin claimed that his brother-in-law, Shen Mingfa, worked as a translator for the Japanese and could find a way to make the company willing to pay a large sum of money. They then colluded with Bu Hao and others to</p>
<p>extort money. When that failed, they abducted Jiang. According to the hostage Jiang Beihai, the defendants first came to the store at 2:30 PM on the 28th of last month, claiming that the coal in the store was all Japanese goods and that 100 silver dollars were required as compensation. He refused. Bu and others then designated the Pinfang Tea House on Juli Road as the place to negotiate the next day. He went there at the designated time, but there were no results. Unexpectedly, at 6:30 AM on the morning of the 3rd, Bu led five foreign ruffians to the store, looking for the owner to negotiate. Since the owner was not there, they abducted him and hid him in</p>
<p>No. 469, 4th floor, Old Barde Road, North Jiangxi Road. Later, he was rescued by the French police. When questioned, all the defendants denied going to the victim's store with the ruffians to abduct him. They all claimed that they went to demand money for a society. The rest of the confessions were evasive. Judge Zhang Minsheng questioned them and ordered the case to be postponed to the 17th for further questioning. All the defendants were detained.</p>
<h3>Japanese Military Vehicles Drove Through the French Concession Yesterday</h3>
<p>A Strange Phenomenon Initially Discovered Within the Concession</p>
<p>According to the English-language "Great Evening Post," this morning (the 3rd) at 10:00 AM, a squadron of Japanese motorcycles led four military trucks, speeding past Avenue Joffre. Residents of the French Concession found it quite strange, as it was the first time since the outbreak of the Shanghai War in 1937 that Japanese military vehicles had been seen passing through the French Concession. It has been investigated that the French Concession authorities previously restricted the passage of Japanese military vehicles through the territory. Recently, the French and Japanese authorities in the city reached an agreement to cancel the restriction. Therefore, it is expected that Japanese military vehicles will continue to pass through the French Concession to travel between Nanshi and Hongqiao in the future.</p>
<h3>Charitable Organizations Actively Evacuate Refugees</h3>
<p>Since the August 13th Incident, the joint disaster relief committee of charitable organizations has provided relief to a large number of refugees in the war zone. At its peak, it accommodated more than 200,000 refugees in more than 70 shelters. The committee has no funding and relies entirely on donations from all walks of life to maintain its operations. Recently, donations have dwindled, and with the soaring price of rice and the high cost of everything, it is extremely difficult to cope. It has no choice but to actively evacuate and resettle the refugees separately. In addition to those elderly, disabled, widowed, and orphaned who have no home to return to, who will be relocated and continue to be accommodated, it has also been agreed to close the Cilin and Gonghua centers within a limited time. Teachers at the Cilian Middle School and other institutions will be temporarily suspended from work during the summer vacation, according to school practice. Because there is no rice to cook, the problem of refugee living is still difficult, so it is necessary to tighten all expenses. Currently, the number of people being accommodated is around 5,700. Within the possible range, it is necessary to find ways to evacuate them.</p>
<h3>A Strange Solar Phenomenon</h3>
<p>A Black Halo Surrounding the Sun, Edged with Colored Light</p>
<p>According to the English-language "Great Evening Post," a very rare phenomenon was discovered in the high sky at noon today (the 3rd). A black halo surrounded the sun, and the edges were tinged with colored light, resembling clouds, but appearing higher than the cloud layer. The sun was still clearly visible, and sunlight continued to shine through the black circle. The Xujiahui Observatory is currently busy studying the phenomenon but has not yet explained its cause.</p>
<p>Another report states that at around 1:20 PM yesterday, a huge dark gray circle suddenly appeared around the blazing sun in the sky. The outer ring of the circle had colored edges that resembled a rainbow but were not quite like one. At that time, the sunlight was also slightly dimmed. By 1:55 PM, the gray light in the northern part first disappeared, and it completely disappeared by 2:00 PM. Those in the know said it was a solar halo.</p>

<h3>Unstable Environment, Gold Market Depressed</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spot gold dark market showed a slight decline, but people's hearts were clearly weak and depressed. This was due to the impact of various unstable situations. Although foreign exchange tightened after easing, gold prices ultimately failed to rise. The opening price in the early morning was 5,410 yuan, which was 20 yuan lower than the closing price before the holiday. Later, it rose slightly, but unexpectedly, the money exchange banks unanimously sold off, and the silver shops also dumped their holdings, which was most noteworthy. After this considerable selling pressure, it fell to 5,330 yuan. Later, with the support of the securities firms and money exchange businesses, some were bought back, raising the price by several tens of yuan before closing. The result was only 5,345 yuan, a drop of 85 yuan compared to before the holiday. In the afternoon, there was no market on Wednesday. The half-day trading was still active, around 2,000 taels. Silver jewelry ultimately quoted a small increase of ten yuan, while customs gold remained flat.</p>
<p>Spot Gold Fell by 85 Yuan</p>
<p>Since morning, each bar (ten taels), initially due to weak market sentiment, a certain money exchange business first called for selling, and the opening price was immediately 20 yuan lower than before the holiday. The money exchange business offered silver shops ten taels for 5,410 yuan. Shortly after, another money exchange business sold 20 taels to a gold shop for 5,415 yuan. After that, buyers watched and waited, and the silver shops tended to sell. At the same time, money exchange businesses and retail investors were full of selling intentions. Soon, it continued to fall by 85 yuan. A silver shop offered ten taels to a silver business, at a lower price of 5,330 yuan. Then, another money exchange business came to buy at the low price, and the sellers had also decreased. Moreover, thanks to the healthy appetite of the securities firms, the price gradually rose, with a silver business offering ten taels to a gold shop, rising to 5,380 yuan. At noon, the number of buyers decreased again, and the silver shops and retail investors frequently sold off, making it 35 yuan lower again. A silver business offered ten taels each to a silver shop and a gold shop, making the noon closing price 5,345 yuan. As a result, it fell by 85 yuan compared to the previous day. An 85 yuan fluctuation in half a day. The selling price of current gold from gold shops was about ten yuan higher than the spot gold price, and the buying price was reduced by 30 yuan. The current standard gold was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there was little trading.</p>

As a result, Da Tong Hang changed the listed price to 550 yuan. The new businesses had similar prices, and the buying price was reduced by about 30 yuan.</p>
<h3>Securities: Domestic Bonds Rise and Fall Suddenly, Foreign Stocks Fall by 10%</h3>
<p>The securities dark market resumed normal operations yesterday after a three-day holiday. During these three days, the complexity of the concession issue, the evolution of the international situation, and the news of Mr. Song Ziwen's arrival in the United States were all significant and not irrelevant. However, the market's feeling was still quite numb, because most of the current market transactions are temporary in nature, with sudden entries and exits, which does not affect the market. Large holders of spot goods still have deep faith and are not shaken by the environment, and are already in an unshakable position. The amount of spot goods held by general retail investors is limited. As the interest payment is approaching, they do not want to suffer this unnecessary sacrifice. Yesterday morning, Cunyi Qianzhuang bought Class A bonds, No. 16 bought Class E bonds, and Le Mao needed both Class A and Class E bonds. Retail investors gathered on Class C bonds, but No. 20, Lianyi, Renchang, and others supplied a lot. The market price was only slightly stronger for Class A bonds. In the afternoon, No. 20 bought Class E bonds again, and Tongshun, Lianhe, and Jiufeng were all very interested in Class C bonds, but No. 38 sold a particularly large amount of Class C bonds. Class A bonds suddenly had sellers but no buyers, causing them to weaken. Therefore, the result was that Class B and Class D bonds did not rise or fall, and the rest only fell by a small 1/5 to 1/10 of a yuan. The transaction volume was more than 600,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below:</p>
<p>Category, Highest, Lowest, Closing Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>Unified Class A, 61.45, 61.25, 61.15, down 0.10</p>
<p>Unified Class B, 52.0, 51.90, 51.90, flat</p>
<p>Unified Class C, 50.30, 50.20, 50.2, down 0.05</p>
<p>Unified Class D, 48.80, --, 48.80, flat</p>
<p>Unified Class E, 50.00, 49.95, 50.00, down 0.05</p>
<p>In stock trading, 50 shares of Qingfeng Yarn Factory were traded at a price of 75 yuan. The stock market prices published in this newspaper are based on those that have already been settled. Any prices with only buyers but no sellers, or only sellers but no buyers, or even large differences between buying and selling quotations, are not factual and are not listed.</p>
<p>Yesterday's stock market at the Public Industry Association opened with weak market sentiment, because the news spread during the holiday was unstable and serious. All prices generally fell by 10% compared to before the holiday, but at low prices, there were quite a few buyers maintaining the market, and the closing trend was stable. Rubber stocks were bleak, with only British Java having considerable demand at 19 yuan and Di Bang at 1 yuan.</p>
<h3>Sichuan Province Post-War Lottery</h3>

<h3>Hang Lung Properties Dividend</h3>
<p>Hang Lung Properties Limited, a British company, is scheduled to pay an interim dividend of 40 cents per share in national currency on July 5th for the ordinary shares for the year ending September 1940.</p>
<h3>Grain: Rice Prices Slightly Soft</h3>
<p>The supply of foreign rice continues. In addition to the arrival of more than 10,000 bags previously, it is said that 20,000 to 30,000 bags arrived in Shanghai yesterday. It is also reported that four ships booked in mid-June are expected to arrive in Shanghai soon, and a large number of Siamese rice orders are expected to arrive in Shanghai before mid-June. Under the strict restrictions of the authorities, speculators inevitably have concerns, and many who have made profits take the opportunity to sell. Therefore, prices fell all the way after the market opened. No. 1 Saigon rice fell to 65.20 yuan, No. 2 to 63.35 yuan, fire-cooked rice to within 65 yuan, and Xiao Wen rice to 62 yuan. Although prices rebounded a few cents at the close, they were still nearly one yuan lower than the price limit, and two to three yuan lower than the previous day's above-limit price. Trading slowed down, with less than 4,000 bags traded in the entire half-day. Recycled rice in 18-bag packages was 73 yuan, and in 26-bag packages, it was 70 yuan, nearly 100 tons.</p>
<p>Foreign rice continues to arrive. Yesterday, Jardine Matheson's Yong Sheng arrived in Shanghai, carrying 11,502 bags from Hong Kong, berthed at the Roosevelt Wharf for unloading. (祖)</p>
<p>For japonica and glutinous domestic rice, more than 1,000 bags of japonica rice have arrived. There is a shortage of glutinous rice. It is rumored that in the off-market japonica rice dark market, given the sluggishness of foreign rice, market sentiment is also soft, and few transactions are made. Selling prices have fallen by nearly one yuan. Changbang special clear japonica rice is 74.35 yuan to 74 yuan, and Su Kun Changzhou white japonica rice ranges from 72-73 yuan, followed by Su Re at 69.50 yuan, Qing Si special thin rice at 74.20 yuan, Da Shi at 72-73 yuan, Su Jue at 70 yuan, Nan Gang early rice at 71-70 yuan. Due to the lack of glutinous rice, although the sales market is limited, the market sentiment remains firm, and the market is particularly good, more than half a yuan higher. Jin Li special yuan rice is 63.50 yuan to 63 yuan, and Chang Dan white yuan rice is 62.50 yuan to 61 yuan, Jiangbei white yuan rice ranges from 60 yuan to 59 yuan, it is said.</p>
<h3>Flour Firm and Expensive, Wheat Arrivals Still Scarce</h3>
<p>Flour: Yesterday's market remained firm and stable. After the No. 2 flour mill increased prices three times last week, the authorities have strictly supervised and limited rice prices, which must not exceed the closing price of June 29th. The retail price of Lao Che brand flour must not exceed 15.50 yuan per bag. Therefore, it is difficult for the mill price to increase again, but the more expensive rice becomes, the more flour sales increase. It is estimated that the two mills directly sold 1,500 bags in total throughout the day. The recycled goods price stood at 16.45 yuan, and the customer price was above 17 yuan, but no formal agreements were reached. However, in recent days, Japanese-made flour from the mainland has been shipped to Shanghai. It is reported that Jinshan brand is offered at 16 yuan, and more than 1,000 bags have also been traded.</p>
<p>Wheat: Although new wheat sources have arrived in batches in recent days, they are not transported by Chinese merchants, and the peak period of arrivals may still be awaited. Currently, both Japanese and Chinese mills are showing a trend of releasing and buying up inventory. It is reported that the foreign company Johnson &amp; Co. purchased 200 bags of Wuhu wheat at a price of 25.10 yuan, and Fuxin Mill also purchased 250 bags at the same price. There is no news of formal transactions in the market. Other small-scale purchases by Japanese mills cannot be regarded as part of the formal market discussion.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Coarse Yarn Still Has Good Sales, Double Horse Plummets and Slightly Rebounds</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market resumed business as usual after the bank closed. The market condition started weak and then leveled off. This was because actual transactions were still good. Both Hong Kong and Yunnan merchants had a strong demand for coarse yarn. Therefore, the stagnant market was completely offset by immediate sales, despite the serious situation in Hong Kong. According to South China merchants, the purchased yarn was re-routed for shipment, transferring from Yangon to Kunming. Therefore, market sentiment has recovered. However, yesterday morning's spot market price was 30 yuan cheaper than the mill warehouse price, showing a clear inverted market situation. Although Hong Kong and Yunnan are procuring, it is still difficult to reverse this weak market. 20-count Double Horse yarn is still hovering within the 900 yuan range.</p>
<p>The opening price of spot yarn in the morning was due to reports of a tense situation in Hong Kong, which was the biggest factor of market unrest. Therefore, market sentiment was weak, and the price of 20-count Double Horse yarn was 865 yuan, a drop of 60 yuan before the closure. However, a portion of it was bought back, rebounding to 885 yuan. Later, it was heard that foreign exchange was softening, and it turned downward again, weakening to 870 yuan. Finally, thanks to good procurement by Yunnan and Hong Kong merchants, with 1,300 bales traded, it rose to 887 yuan at the close. It is found that 2,940 bales were traded in the half-day. The market price of 20-count Double Horse yarn fell by 38 yuan. Today, 30 pieces of cotton yarn will be shipped to Hong Kong. The amount purchased by each merchant group is listed as follows:</p>
<p>Same trade 1,380, Hong Kong 685</p>
<p>Yunnan 740, Mainland 70</p>
<p>Ningbo 125, Total 2,940</p>
<h3>Indian Cotton Plummets, Orders Arrive Steadily</h3>
<p>The situation of spot cotton remains lifeless, because the yarn market is mediocre, coupled with the rampant decline in overseas Indian cotton, so people's hearts are even less excited. The Indian cotton ordered by various parties in the past is still arriving steadily. However, Japanese mills have a slight appetite, but the payment delay is one to two months later. The Chinese mills are quieter.</p>
<p>The market price of foreign cotton, the New York cotton market, fell in the early morning due to pressure from sellers. Later, due to good spot transactions and some purchases of new cotton, the closing price of the near-term contract fell by 8 points compared to the previous day, while the far-term contract rebounded by 2-3 points. Due to transportation difficulties in India, local merchants are selling off in the market, resulting in a sharp drop in selling prices. Yesterday, the predicted father fell by more than 7 rupees.</p>
<p>In the Shanghai cotton trading market, it is widely rumored that British goods will no longer be loaded on Japanese ships. If this is true, then only British company ships may be able to transport them. However, British ships need to transport too many goods. In the future, the arrival of Indian cotton in Shanghai will be even scarcer, and the opportunity to hoard spot goods may be inevitable. Therefore, stimulated by this news, the intention of the industry is unusually firm. However, trading has been sluggish recently. Apart from some scattered transactions by Japanese mills in the old silver futures market, the Chinese mills are unusually quiet.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains: Oil Mills Actively Buying Soybeans, Prices Remain High</h3>
<p>Yesterday's soybean market condition, because the source was slightly continued, plus it was difficult for hoarders to hold goods in their hands for a long time. The market was deadlocked until yesterday, when the oil mills showed strong potential for active buying, with buyers and sellers both active, resulting in a lively trade in the half-day. Prices remained firm and high. It is estimated that more than 3,000 bags of Qingdao beans were traded at a price of 30 yuan, 18 cartloads of Bengbu beans at a price of 29 yuan, more than 1,000 bags of Anqing beans at a price of 28.50 yuan to 29.20 yuan, and 400 bags of Dalian mixed green beans at a price of 31 yuan, 500 bags of Xiao Dong Du beans at a price of 28.90 yuan to 29.40 yuan, and 100 bags of Chongming sand yellow beans at a price of 27 yuan, it is said.</p>
<p>In addition, 637 bags of soybeans were shipped to Hong Kong today.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Foreign Exchange Eases, Coarse White Sugar Falls</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market saw prices fall together due to the easing of foreign exchange. The association's listed prices were 69.70 yuan for the current 24 group white sugar in original packaging, and 69 yuan for other sugar, a drop of about 1 yuan. Transit goods were 54.50 yuan, and warehouse receipts for delivery on July 10th were 55.20 yuan, a drop of 1.50 to 1.60 yuan. Taikoo coarse white sugar B mark was 80 yuan to 79.50 yuan, a drop of 1.50 to 2 yuan. HY mark was 77.50 yuan, Dutch red sugar was down a little at 57.50 yuan, Ben Yun white sugar was 69.50 yuan, No. 1 rock sugar was 91.50 yuan, and Jing Ming ice was 93 yuan. However, domestic sugar remained stable. Dia Qing opened for more than 100 bags of Taikoo ship arrivals at 64.50 yuan, up 0.50 yuan, and dozens of baskets of Tiao Qing at 46 yuan. Also, 200 bags of sugar came from Hong Kong yesterday.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth Falls Step by Step</h3>
<p>Domestic cloth: Yesterday's market prices were firm at the opening due to the strong momentum before the closure. However, as there were few buyers, the selling prices fell step by step. As a result, each piece of white fine cloth, twill, and coarse cloth fell by 0.25 yuan to 0.50 yuan. The selling prices of bleached, dyed, and printed cloth varied greatly, falling by about 1 yuan. The wholesale shops on Mu Street catered to the traffic along both sides of the roads and in northern Jiangsu and northern Anhui, dealing in more than 8,000 pieces of coarse cloth and bleached cloth. The Zhejiang-Jiangxi merchants dealt in 150-160 pieces of fine cloth, coarse cloth, and colored cloth. The Henan merchants saw a sharp decline in shipments due to the emergency of the war on the Longhai Railway. The Guangdong-Yunnan merchants were also in a state of stagnation. However, the northern Tianjin merchants dealt in more than 100 pieces of colored cloth and woolen goods.</p>
<p>Eastern cloth: Yesterday morning's opening market sentiment was firm, with Longtou fine cloth seeing 31.50 yuan. Unexpectedly, the industry dumped their holdings, and customers were helpless, leading to a step-by-step decline, with a particularly strong downward trend. The closing price of the later market fell to 28.75 yuan. Four Gentlemen's Serge fell from 0.90 yuan per yard to 0.845 yuan. From a sales perspective, there is still a lack of good prospects in the short term. It is faintly heard that the Japanese factories have reduced working hours by 30% since July 1st, hoping to maintain the falling market price, but the result may be difficult to achieve.</p>
<p>Exports: 19 pieces of cotton cloth were shipped to Hong Kong today.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Raw Silk Arrives in Shanghai Continuously</h3>
<p>A large batch of Wuxi white raw silk arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday, transported from Wuxi by Hua Cheng, Fuxing, Chaojing, etc., totaling about 300 piculs. The export method is roughly a special expenditure of 300 yuan per picul. It is heard that the finished products of the Wuxi silk mills have accumulated to more than 1,000 piculs. After the beginning of July, the export problem will be even more difficult. Yesterday, 10 pieces of raw silk came from Hong Kong, and 3 major bundles of artificial silk also came.</p>
<h3>Medicinal Materials: More Arrivals of Rosary Peas, Prices Fall by 50-60 Yuan</h3>
<p>Since the previous market opened rosary peas at 200 yuan, the consignors were able to profit quite a bit. Therefore, there are many continuous shipments to Shanghai, so the stock in the market is quite abundant. However, in recent days, sales have been slow, leading to a sudden drop in sales. Currently, the best grade with no black spots is 150 yuan, and the next grade is 140 yuan, but there are few buyers. Compared with the previous market, it has to fall by a huge 50-60 yuan.</p>
<h3>Seafood: Dried Shrimp Rebounds</h3>
<p>The previous market for dried shrimp was sluggish, and the trend was very weak. For example, foreign mountain dried shrimp only sold for 105 yuan. However, in recent days, the arrival of goods has been scarce, and sales have gradually become active. Market sentiment has therefore turned optimistic. The current market is calling for a high price of 115 yuan. Next, Ningbo shrimp also requires 85 yuan, and Yantai goods are very scarce, calling for 100 yuan.</p>
<h3>Coal: Hongji Small Coal Shortage</h3>
<p>Hongji No. 1 small white coal has recently entered the summer season, and the laundry business has developed, so sales have also turned prosperous. However, the original source of goods from the production area is extremely scarce, so prices are rising steadily. The market is calling for 220 yuan per ton for No. 1 small coal, exceeding the price of lump coal. No. 2 small coal is 210 yuan. The market price of screened small coal is 5-6 yuan cheaper.</p>
<h3>Dried Goods: Summer Orange Cakes Look Up</h3>
<p>The previous arrival of Xiamen orange cakes was very limited, and good grades have been out of stock for a long time. It is found that 20 buckets were imported yesterday on a Sichuan ship. According to customer information, the cost is higher, and later the command will be issued, so the listed price is shouted to rise by 3-4 yuan, but it has not been traded. Judging from the market situation, it is bound to rise.</p>

<h3>A Study of the Manchurian Situation</h3>
<p>Jilin is the old country of Manchuria, the land where the current dynasty prospered, and Ningguta is located there, which is the Jianzhou Right Guard of the Ming Dynasty. There are five tribes: Suksuhu River, Hun River, Wanyan, Suo E, and Zhe Chen. To the north of Manchuria are the four Zhilun tribes: Yehe, Hada, Huifa, and Ula. Only Ula is in Jilin, in northeastern Manchuria, while Huifa, Hada, and Yehe are all north of Xingjing, now under the jurisdiction of the Shengjing General, all named after the rivers they inhabit. The Ufa and Huifa rivers flow into the Songhua River, and the Hada and Yehe rivers flow into the Liao River, which is the Xihai Guard of the Ming Dynasty, also known as the North and South Passes. Hada is the South Pass and Yehe is the North Pass, both close to Kaiyuan and Tieling, which are the outer barriers of the Ming border. What is now governed by the Jilin General is the old city of Qianla, which is more than four miles from east to west, bordering the Yalu River and Tumen River in the south, and the Ula River and Songhua River in the north, up to the Hundong River, and the south bank is the lower reaches of the Heilongjiang River. To its east is the north side of Changbai Mountain. I once read the "A Study of the Origin of the Manchurian Clans," which said that the Norenbui tribe is located more than one hundred li northeast of Ningguta, residing on both banks of the Hulaha River and Songhua River, which is the Kuleha tribe. The Mulun tribe is located more than one thousand li east of Ningguta, residing on both banks of the Ussuri River. Two hundred li further east, the Naiya tribe and the Kala tribe reside near the source of the Renman River. These two tribes are the Woji tribe, all on the eastern route.</p>

<h3>The Romanian Playboy King</h3>
<p>— Wen He</p>
<p>When it comes to the life story of Carol II, King of Romania, it's like a Hollywood palace film: both steamy and exciting, with lingering love and tense warfare. Even his appearance is so handsome and romantic that it would be perfectly suitable for him to star in this movie himself.</p>
<p>Don't think of him as a very autocratic monarch now; in his youth, he was also a socialist. He repeatedly declared that the monarchy was outdated, that he firmly believed in republicanism and embraced socialism. At that time, his great-uncle Carol I was on the throne, and seeing such a progressive young man in the royal family, he was greatly displeased and forcibly prevented him from studying, telling him to join the army.</p>
<p>This prince, who believed in socialism, was indeed thoroughly egalitarian. He fell in love with a commoner girl, Miss Zizi Lambrino. At that time, his father Ferdinand had already succeeded to the throne, but this King was muddleheaded and incompetent. His mother, Queen Marie (granddaughter of Queen Victoria of England), was more shrewd and capable, and she strongly opposed her son marrying a commoner. However, Crown Prince Carol was also a formidable figure, and he was very good at seizing opportunities. When the German army invaded Romania, and the Romanian royal family and the remnants of the defeated soldiers all fled to Russia, he saw his chance and boldly married Miss Zizi. At this time, everyone was a refugee, and although his elders opposed the marriage, they could do nothing about it. After marrying Zizi, he had a son.</p>
<p>His mother knew that it was useless to oppose him head-on; she understood that the best way to make a young man forget a woman was to introduce him to another. So she acted as a matchmaker and arranged for him to meet Princess Helen of Greece in Switzerland. This Princess Helen could be said to be one of the most beautiful golden branches and jade leaves of the European royal families at that time. The two later held a grand wedding in Athens. As a result, he had another son. But he found this life too boring.</p>
<p>It just so happened that a financier named Luo Jing had a daughter. She had light red hair and snow-white skin, not only was she enchantingly beautiful, but also exceptionally intelligent. She was the Madame Lupescu who would become famous all over the world. Carol fell in love with her again. She eventually became pregnant, and in order to give the child in her womb a nominal father, she married one of his guards. This child was Carol's third son.</p>
<p>Later, Madame Lupescu left Luo Jing and wandered all over Europe. Crown Prince Carol then decided once again to sacrifice his position and also left Luo Jing. The lovers met in Italy and later went to France and England.</p>
<p>Queen Marie really felt that there was no way to deal with this son. Romania stopped remitting money for him to use, hoping to make him realize his mistakes. However, Madame Lupescu's business skills were very high, and he cooperated with her to do business very smoothly. Through his dealings with Western European banks, he had long abandoned his socialist ideas from his youth. These years of commercial experience had turned Carol into a shrewd businessman, and he now even wanted to earn Hitler's money.</p>
<p>He lived intimately with Madame Lupescu and felt very happy, so he automatically announced his renunciation of the right of succession to the throne. They had money, friends, and freedom; who would still yearn for this dull court? Therefore, when the Romanian parliament later passed a law stipulating that he would never be able to succeed to the throne, he just laughed it off.</p>
<p>In 1927, Carol's father died, and Carol's six-year-old son Michael ascended the throne. The stubborn bureaucrats who had always opposed Carol actually formed a regency, wielding power and influence. Carol, seeing this situation abroad, felt very uncomfortable. One day in 1930, he suddenly took a plane back to China, which surprised the world. A few days later, he overthrew his own son's throne and crowned himself king.</p>
<p>Under these international circumstances, it is also difficult for him to be this king. However, he remembers that Romania was a victorious country in the last World War, and he will never let go of his spoils of war. Among the leaders of the small countries in Europe, he is probably Hitler's formidable opponent: he is as adventurous as Hitler, as greedy for power, and as fond of extraordinary life.</p>

<p>Hawthorne Case</p>
<h3>The Homecoming of the Dance Queen</h3>
<p>— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter Two "A Page of History!"</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou seemed unwilling to let go after having seized the opportunity to speak. He simply blocked the notepad and pen and continued to ask, "What did he come for?"</p>
<p>Jinmei said, "Naturally to look for Miss Wang. He was very angry when he heard that Miss Wang was not here. He seemed to want to make things difficult for her, and his appearance was very suspicious."</p>
<p>Hawthorne's eyes flickered, and he regained his speaking position, nodding repeatedly and saying, "Yes, yes, if he has something like that, then it is of course very suspicious. But we still have to get back to the subject and first find out the reason for the quarrel between Yu Gantang and your master. How did they quarrel?"</p>
<p>Although Hawthorne tried to bring the topic back to the harbor, it caused Jinmei to hesitate again. She paused before saying, "I don't know exactly why."</p>
<p>"Didn't you just say it was because of Zhao Boxiong?"</p>
<p>"That's... that's my guess."</p>
<p>"Okay, just say: Your guess is fine too."</p>
<p>She said haltingly, "That day—that is, the day that Elder Li came, Zhao Boxiong was talking to Miss Wang in this room. Young Master Yu suddenly came, and the two of them started arguing. Fortunately, Elder Li came down from upstairs and persuaded Young Master Yu to leave. Young Master Yu has not come since that day."</p>
<p>Hawthorne said, "Is this Young Master Yu fighting with Zhao Boxiong?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"You just said he was arguing with Miss Wang."</p>
<p>"He quarreled with Zhao Boxiong first, and then he argued with Miss Wang."</p>
<p>"That's strange. Why?"</p>
<p>"Because... because Miss Wang seemed to be helping the Zhao surname speak. She also glanced at her dead master."</p>
<p>"Well, you must have heard what they said when they were arguing, right?"</p>
<p>"I don't know exactly... I wasn't nearby."</p>
<p>Hawthorne slowly dropped his cigarette butt into the silver ashtray on the round table. His eyes paused briefly when they passed over the two wine glasses on the table, as if admiring the pattern engraved on the glass.</p>
<p>He suddenly asked, "Does Young Master Yu drink alcohol too?"</p>
<p>Jinmei also looked up and glanced at the wine glasses on the table, shaking her head and saying, "He doesn't drink alcohol... But Zhao Boxiong does."</p>
<p>"Oh, how do you know?"</p>
<p>"I've often seen Zhao Boxiong drinking with Miss Wang." (34)</p>

<h3>A Family Visit to Gong Qiuxia</h3>
<p>— Kai Zhuang</p>
<p>Gong Qiuxia, one of the Five Tiger Generals of the Plum Blossom Troupe in those years, and who recently performed in the film "Yanmen Pass", and her "husband" Hu Xinling, and his younger sister Hu Rongrong, are also "Three Heroes of a Family" in the film industry. Unexpectedly, yesterday the reporter visited a friend in Mingde Lane and happened to meet Hu Xinling, so he made a casual chat at his residence:</p>
<p>"Regarding Mr. Hu's previous directing life, please tell me something:"</p>
<p>"Speaking of directing life, I really dare not be it. It was in the 23rd year of the Republic of China (1934) when my father Shaoyu and a lawyer co-founded a culture film company. In that year of my childhood, I directed a "Parents and Children" film, starring Rongrong and Gong Qiuxia. The following year, Star Film Company asked someone to invite me, and I joined the Star Film Company's second factory. I worked with Ouyang Yuqian to direct "Qingming Festival". After the Star Film Company's second factory closed, I co-directed "New Year's Money" with Zhang Shichuan and Zheng Xiaoqiu in the first factory, starring Hu Rongrong.</p>
<p>Many people want to know a little about the history of your two's love. Can you publish a bit?" The reporter finished speaking, Miss Gong smiled, meaning to tell Hu Xinling not to say, but in the end he still told me a little. He said:</p>
<p>"Our acquaintance began when she belonged to the Plum Blossom Song and Dance Troupe. As for when she was in the Jian De Savings Association song and dance class, we were not acquainted yet." After speaking, Hu Rongrong took her schoolbag and came home.</p>
<p>"Rongrong hasn't filmed any movies recently, right?" the reporter asked.</p>
<p>"Yes, because the current trend of the film industry seems to be not very suitable for children to make movies, so a few film companies recently intended to invite Rongrong to make movies, but I declined them, letting her study hard for a while before talking about it."</p>
<p>"So Mr. Hu himself rarely cares about the film business, right?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I don't know why, but I seem to feel an unspeakable disappointment with today's film industry. My family has always believed in Christianity, so recently my interests have turned to Christianity, and I am currently writing several books about Christianity.</p>
<p>"But we are unwilling to give up on film art, especially since Qiuxia is still filming in Xinhua, but Rongrong's resumption of film life may have to be delayed for a period."</p>
<h3>Miss Yuan Meiyun's younger sister, Lingyun, is fifteen years old this year, and is intelligent by nature. She learned Qingyi at a young age and follows the Mei school. She has a beautiful appearance and excellent figure and voice. She is proficient in no less than fifty or sixty plays, especially the works of Huashan. Like Hua Tiancuo, Hong Ni Guan, Yutangchun, Ma Dian, Hong Xi and Universe Feng, etc., she is skilled in them. If she seeks further refinement in the future, her future is unlimited. The above picture is a still from her play.</h3>

<h3>Impressions of "The Grapes of Wrath"</h3>
<p>— Jun Tao</p>
<p>The struggle of hunger, the departure from the hometown, the threat of death, all of this is the sin of capitalist society. Because of the deepening of oppression, the trampled will revolt and be angry; and the reward for rebellion and anger is often wandering around the world... This is the general story of the film. It tries its best to expose the exploitation of the weak by capitalism and tries its best to criticize the ugly state, and that the profound description, the forceful rendering, can be said that this film is a head stick to capitalism, the cry of the working class!</p>
<p>The significance of the film is as mentioned above, and its style is particularly incompatible with the recent Hollywood-style works. Looking at the common characteristics, there are three points: (1) The entire film is composed of rough lines, with a strong Soviet film flavor. It also utilizes the effects of photography, lighting, and darkness to make the film beautiful and lovely. It is rare in recent films; (2) Because this film is faithful to John Steinbeck's original work, the entire film is about the long journey of the Tom family, and the various situations of joy, anger, sorrow, and joy. And the romance that is indispensable to general films is gone! (3) The director John Ford's style is similar to John M. Stahl. He gave up the stimulation of the climax and used delicate descriptions to run through the entire film, but there were tense performances everywhere. The dialogue is very heavy. If you don't understand it, then watching this film is a big loss.</p>
<p>There are many beautiful and wonderful scenes in the whole film. For example, the grandfather did not want to go to California, and the family tried to drug him and take him with them, and later died on the way. And the final mother and son parting, etc., all leave a deep impression. Generally speaking, the first half is better than the second half. And the primitiveness and emphasis of the picture make people excited!</p>
<p>Director John Ford is very good, and his technical methods are very sophisticated. The actor Henry Fonda's Tommy personality is very suitable, and his performance has reached perfection, but the inner pain cannot be expressed completely. Jane Darwell, who plays Kathy, is a successful actor. The rest, such as Jane Darwell, who plays the mother, and Charley Grapewin, who plays the grandfather, are all rare. In short, this film is a very meaningful film.</p>
<h3>Twenty Kinds of Ballads (13) Double Pearl Phoenix</h3>
<p>— Written by Dongyun, Illustrated by Xiuyan</p>
<p>"Falling Golden Fan" (Ballad No. 6) The plot is that "Miss Lu Qingyun lost a small mud-gilded fan, which was picked up by Zhou Xuewen; so he sold himself to learn to sing, returned the fan to ask for love, and finally fulfilled his wish." Now this "Double Pearl Phoenix" is a repetitive performance of such a story. However, the pearl phoenix replaced the golden fan, and Zhou Xuewen and Lu Qingyun in "Falling Golden Fan" are Wen Bizheng and Huo Dingjin here.</p>
<p>After Wen Bizheng sold himself into the Huo mansion, he could not enter the boudoir of the young lady; the corner of the red building was close at hand! Fortunately, on the birthday of Huo Tianguan, he was ordered to send flowers, so he was lucky enough to realize his expectations. This section "Sending Flowers to the Building" is what the ballad singers who sing "Double Pearl Phoenix" call the "Guan Zishu".</p>
<p>In the past era of "polygamy", "romantic talents" of course could not be satisfied with one wife. Therefore, the author made Wen Bizheng occupy Dingjin, the autumn flowers, a pair of masters and servants, and even pulled Ni Afeng to be the guests. She also felt not lively enough, but also spared a Li Zhufeng.</p>
<p>The ornament lost by Huo Dingjin is "Pearl Phoenix", and Miss Li's boudoir name also calls "Pearl Phoenix", which is the so-called "Double Pearl Phoenix".</p>
