<p>社評</p>
<h3>「妥協辦文件」</h3>
<p>高宗武陶希聖於本月二十一日，將所攝存抄錄之在日妥協文件，在香港揭布。據高陶函稱，彼等與聞磋商之進行，某件手交，某事與議，於十二月三十日簽字。據東京消息，妥協之件，於本月初，由日方某要人責往東京；迄八日止、先後完成其興亞院通過，內閣校准，首相入奏諸步驟。據滬港所傳，高陶之離滬赴港，亦本月初之事。</p>
<p>在方對此，辯稱高陶所發表之文件，只是交涉中間之日方片面提案，既非日方最早之要求，亦非折衝最後之結果，而爲斷章取義之片段紀錄。又稱最近數度之折衝、高陶已未參與。又稱凡非中國國民所能接受者，凡有損害中國之自由獨立與生存之條件者，决不接受。又稱最近所作成之和平方案基礎、爲高陶所不及聞知。又稱正式和的須由「中央政府」之名義，始能簽字，亦只有以「中央政府」之名義發表之。</p>
<p>右所云云，參商之甚。其間情僞、乃任何人之主觀所得析辨判斷；至於客觀定論，猶待確切之旁證；若抑揚其辭，褒貶其事，曾不足以增减其間之薰蕕，亦不足以損益其間之事實。蓋以我人之觀感；事關中華民族之生死存亡，其性質無上嚴重，其影響無上遠大；絕非日本人之誠意，和平論之眞諦，在精衛之信念，所堪保證；亦即絕非僅賴類此保證，竟堪託付；故不問在日妥協文件之眞或假，不同在日妥協內容之寬厚或殘酷，要非中華民族生死存亡之管鑰，而僅爲妥協者之妥協而已。決定生死存亡，端視抗戰勝敗。有戰必有和，顧必日本承認失敗，至少亦必承認不勝，然後可以保證生存而蘄求和平；否則，無法保證於避免亡國條件或準亡國條件，避免於即死或慢性死。今者，日本雖自知不勝，而未坦然承認不勝；汪氏以日本爲不能全勝，而以中國爲既敗；此爲在氏獨具之見解，其是非茲不遑申論，然亦惟在日之態度如此，心理如此，故其妥協之內容即使不盡如高陶所揭布，亦必逈異於中國軍民於抗戰必勝之信念下之條件。然則居今日而追求妥協條件之眞相，無乃可已！</p>
<p>試作退一步之假定而進一步言之。在氏而有其堅强之和平信念，復置信於日本之誠意，且自信條件之無損於中國獨立自由，抑且自覺如此條件亦屬爭來大不易；然紙的條件，與鐵的現實，以及掩不盡的方來，是三階段而非一事。換言之，凡百自辯自白，既不足以增减薰蕕，損益事實，而於條件所予一般人之視聽觀感，亦不能有所轉變。蓋生死存亡之問題大於一切，國家民族之利害重於一切，藐彼數尺之人，曾何足較；故妥協條件若竟得具體化爲一種狀態之際，猶必以條件下之事實，爲衡量一切之標準，非可以一己爲尺度，亦非可以所謂誠意信念與理論云云，解釋一切。哈嘉，古辛南，溥儀，雖並存於目前之一霎那，其主觀信念或竟彷彿，然現狀殊，評價殊，前途殊，歸宿亦必殊。觀察和平運動與妥協條件下之在氏，亦猶是耳</p>
<p>「妥協文件」與妥協條件之異同，茲固無從析論，然就高陶揭布與在方辯白參合之，有絕無疑問者至少一端：即所謂『日支新關係調整要綱』者，即使並非雙方簽字之文件，至少亦爲日本提案之眞面目。『要綱』所舉，自政治經濟外交文化交通種種方面，制中國於死命，揮各國於門外，其爲企圖獨吞中國之供狀，絕無諱飾餘地。考之提交此項『要綱』者，時在一九三九年十一月五日，即近衛宣言（不索領土，不侵主權，不取賠款）以及和平交響後之三百三四十日，距今僅八句之前，領土主權賠款蓋無一不要矣。我人置信於在方辯白，謂　『要綱』非即簽字之件，然日本前後反覆主於斯極，安得不問所謂日本誠意始於何日？謂如是而猶得折衝至不損自由獨立，寗非古今中外之奇蹟！抑自由獨立有一定之界說者也，有必然之氣象者也，在氏以次，倘無所戒懼於日本之野心不死，誠信不立，而猶不放棄其貫澈和平之信念，則我人請舍高陶之所揭布，先覩自由獨立之妥協條件，再觀自由獨立之精神與形態！</p>

<p>兩性衛生</p>
<h3>從動物的生殖慾</h3>
<p>— 俄國勞衝大學醫科畢業楊道南</p>
<p>說到人類的性生活</p>
<p>從動物的生殖衝動中，有兩種的區別，就是下等動物的性衝動，完全爲內分泌作用所支配，進而至於人類，則除內分泌作用外，尙有中樞神經作用，換句話說，卽性衝動是在由動物進化至人類過程中，已從簡單的下意識作用而變寫複雜的精神作用，所以人類的性行爲，較之動物爲複雜：這種事實，是在比較解剖學和生物學上有很多的實例。無論何種動物，其腦之構造愈簡單，則其所發生的性行爲亦愈低級；反之，中樞神經和腦之構造愈複雜，其性的行爲，愈多精神之影響；而與人類之性行爲亦愈相近似。所以由單純的動物性衝動，進化而爲人類複雜的性現象之原因，是與神經中樞和腦的發達進化相連屬，而有直接關係的。故中樞神經發達的動物，如猿類，猩猩以及人類的性衝動，是不僅以追求異性，達到生殖爲滿足的，尤其是在人類，尙欲將所追求的異性佔爲己有，與之親愛的同居，共營愛的生活，所以人是最高的動物。</p>
<p>故人類一旦喪失了生殖的機能，其同居生活亦受影響，大之離異，小則反目，故不論是何階級的人類，一有早洩，陰痿，神經衰弱，房事不能，及不能生育的毛病時，無不亟求治療，依余多年來治療性病的經騐所知，上述各症，完全山於主宰性慾的靑春腺受手淫或荒淫新傷所致，故手淫過度之人，常患遺精滑遺，早洩陰痿等症，職是故也。故求治療，非尋常製劑斯可奏效，必須服以德國睪丸精質（即靑春腺）製劑男用一補體康」方能澈底治愈，恢復已失之性力，並能促進性器之發育，增强新陳代謝機能。同時能補腦，補血，不論任何衰弱之人，一服「補體康」之後，立刻回春，返老還童，其女用有調經種子之功，並能治性不感症，凡女性對性慾不感興趣者服此即愈。</p>
<p>淋病春秋</p>
<h3>紐西倫花柳病院發表　淋濁特效治績</h3>
<p>紐西倫花柳病院，每年必發表對於花柳病中各種療法，如電療。手術。內服藥等，皆爲嚴格之分析與統計，覺得淋病之療法，惟德國彼德博士發明之淋病特效藥「克淋儂」爲最。該院淋疾主任翰維爾博士作精密之統計，急性淋服「克淋儂」三四男子可外用「抗淋水」，女子瓶，百人中則有九十七人全部治愈。經過十五次以上之檢騐血液，及用攝護腺按摩法，均證明已完全根治。</p>
<p>翰維爾博士又用一般之化學療法，及透膜療法等爲試騐，則百人中之獲愈者，不過三四名，而且依然有再發之弊。因之，「克淋儂」一藥，遂爲舉世發家一致公認之淋病特効藥</p>
<p>美國拉維斯博士，曾在木雪文尼州之醫院中，亦發表關於「克淋儂」一藥治愈成績，證明翰維爾博士之說，拉博士云，對於治淋之藥，余試用屢矣，而其成績總不及「克淋儂」者。良以此劑所根據之學理是採用非特異患療法，與一般化學療法，透膜殺菌療法，大異其趣，凡男女急慢性淋病，余用「克淋儂」治療，其治愈成績爲百分之九六·八。任何現在之淋病內服藥，均無此種崇高之治績也。至於外用藥方面，可外用「卡而雪地陰道片」爲坐藥，按圖與說明書在家自行洗滌，則奏功允偉矣。蓋自「克淋儂」一藥發明後，無限之男女淋病患者，均受此藥之賜而完全脫離此苦。宜爲醫家對此藥刮目相看也。</p>
<h3>肺病宜早省悟</h3>
<p>— 盛在強醫師</p>
<p>大都數的肺病思者，時起一二聲之輕欬，或有劇烈之咳嗽喀，食慾减退，精神萎頓，體重乃日就減輕，於是癆損之症遂成矣。若能在此際予以切實之治療，卽可望其根治，且收效亦易，倘延至重篤之二三兩期，則非有長久之時期，不能治愈。故肺病患者應宣早治療爲要，然要適合治癆之內服劑，本亦難事，此爲余臨床二十年來恒所感到者。惟自德國徒梅博士發明「補肺拿爾」使得豁然而解。蓋「補肺拿爾」之藥效，有滅險肺病酸素之功，而使肺病菌失去其活動之力，故癆症喀血，咳嗽咯痰，胸痛盜汗及潮熱，服之無不霍然。</p>
<h3>向自凟者　進一忠吿</h3>
<p>— 德國醫學博士鄭霆</p>
<p>關於如何斷定少年人是否手淫的一問題，當然是多數做父母師長者所極欲知道的，此問題之解決，非經長期的觀察不可。爲父母者，首須注意審察其習慣和臉色以及健康狀態。凡少年人臉色蒼白，面容疲倦，目光無神，下眼皮發生圓暈線條者，均爲手淫之確實現象。爲父母者應注意其被褥有吾留有液跡，蓋手淫斵傷，時有遺精。倘每日或隔三數日，能在被褥上發現此遺迹，即可認爲手淫或病態。蓋在生理的限度上，決無三數日遺精一次之現象，若有之，即爲病態而須治療。</p>
<p>手淫能使遺精頻繁，身心虧損，故自重的靑年，應隨時警覺，無者勉之，有則改之。萬於健康失常，遺精腦弱，宜於每日睡前進以「耐而斯遺精片」三片，有當夜止遺之功。不論任何繁密之遺精，凶惡之滑精，服「耐而斯遺精片」後即刻减輕。如身體虧損，同時兼以德國內分泌大補劑男用「補體康」補之，兩藥同服，見效如神。</p>
<p>淋病講談</p>
<h3>淋毒性膀胱炎</h3>
<p>— 姚菊嚴醫師撰</p>
<p>診時：上午十時至下午六時</p>
<p>淋毒性膀胱炎之起因甚多，而大多在後尿道炎時，因酗酒勞動房事刺激，乘車騎車，及不攝生而來，致淋菌逆竄上流，從後尿道侵襲膀胱，遂起膀胱炎。尿意頻數，在溺器下之沈澱物甚多，小腹脹悶疝痛，有時則不得小便，有時因淋菌侵入膀胱後，破壞其膀胱壁間之血管，因而有引起尿血之危證，故於此時，尤不可不注意之。此外膀胱炎變症，也可說是續發症，那就是往往因手術之不當，而致發生腎臟炎，腎盂炎等症，故往往更招意外之危險。此爲余多年來之經騐所得，淋病患者萬不可掉以輕心，以致挽救不及。抱恨終身，實爲寃枉之事。</p>
<p>介對於淋毒性膀胱炎，不僅拘守局部的手術，而且還要從根本上着想解決。在內服藥方面，可服德國淋病聖藥「克淋儂」，此藥係用蛋白體黃色素混合製成，故其功力，能直達病灶，而不妨害健全的組織，絕無不良之反應，與般只知透膜殺菌，祗作局部補苴者，大不相同，凡服「克淋儂」後，卽能將炎症消滅，而恢復原有之健，余更佐以膀胱洗滌法，德國感應靜電療法，則淋毒性膀胱炎，於短期內完全排尿暢利，尿液瑩潔，恢復正常之排尿機能，更無變成淋毒性腎臟炎之事兼治梅橫痃下疳及性神經等症診時：上午十時至下午一時每天送診廿號每號僅取號金五角，並贈性病全書一冊。</p>

<h3>華北抗戰力量堅强中立觀察家之所見與印象</h3>
<p>大陸報本月十六日重慶特的通信云、華北華軍抵抗力日趨堅强、已有許多中立觀察家加以證實、據近自北平經邊區政府區域來川之某旅客談其經歷與印象稱、「晋察冀</p>

<h3>日軍偷渡錢江　浙東尙安靜　華人軍嚴堵　日決難得逞　滬市塲竟受謠諑影響</h3>
<p>自日方同盟社電傳日軍偷渡浙東錢塘江後、上海各同鄉團體、紛電詢問眞相、業經證實浙東沿海沿江各地、安謐如常、滬浙航行、依然暢通、惟富陽方面日軍進犯、已爲擊退、浙贛鐵路中斷、允屬無稽、日方於去年二月間、亦曾散發同樣謠傳、旋經證明祇在富陽附近江畔之東沙洲有所企圖、卒爲駐軍堵截擊退而已、故此决日方宣傳伎倆、衆信與上年如出一轍、但昨日下午滬市塲竟受謠諑影響、公債跌而外滙轉緊、其他行市、隨之牽動、</p>
<p>沿海沿江尙稱平靜　紹興七縣同鄉會電餘姚縣長云、「餘姚林縣長鈞鑒、日已渡江確吾、盼電復、紹興七縣同鄕會叩養」迄至昨晚止、尙未得復電、惟寗波台州溫州各處、均有電報到滬、報吿安謐如常、停泊鎭海口外各外輪、昨有無綫電報吿卸貨情形、絕未提及浙東日軍登陸消息、足設浙東沿江沿海各處無事、行駛上海寗波間之外輪、照常行駛、泊鎭海口外之外輪、爲意商中意公司之德平輪、德商禮和洋行之謀福輪、及海福輪、意商義華洋行之寶利輪、仍在照常辦理卸貨裝貨事宜、德平輪昨曾有電報到滬、報吿明準日（二十五日）離鎭駛滬、的二十六日晨可抵達上海、</p>
<p>頭蓬登陸猶未證實　新聲社記者昨向航業界及同鄕團體探悉、浙東沿海、爲寗波·奉化·寗海·象山·台州·溫州·等縣、沿錢塘江爲蕭山·紹興·餘姚·等縣、早有大軍駐紥、並築有防禦工程、戒備甚備嚴密、日軍企圖登陸、決難得逞、同時各縣均有長途電話及軍用電話可通、任何一處如有偷渡情事、各縣決無未聞之理、昨日上海市塲上盛傳蕭山縣屬沿錢塘江之頭蓬三車埭、即海寗縣之對岸、日軍已强行登陸之說、經記者向各方詢問、一時尙未證實、又傳中國銀行曾接紹興分行電吿、蕭山發生戰事之說、該行咋已否認、並謂並未接得紹興分行電報、又記者向另一方面探悉、富陽方面沉寂已久之戰事、近日日軍竟欲大舉進犯、偷渡富春江、但已經擊退、目頭蓬埠江邊泥塗濘滑、沿岸駐有重兵、日軍圖在該處登陸、爲絕不可能、故不待證明、即知其非確、又本埠航業界方面、前晚亦曾以無綫電拍甬訽問、旋得浙東安謐之復電、總上各訊、足釋旅滬浙人之注念也、</p>
<p>浙贛鐵路照常通車　浙贛鐵路自蕭山起至江西省段、今照常通車、並未中斷、蕭山縣屬之聞家堰、以及臨浦光山等車站、亦均安謐、西興方面亦無砲戰發生、至於浙省各地公路、除沿海沿江已自動破壞外、金華通麗水新昌衢縣等公路、則照常行駛客貨各車、富春江沿江戒嚴、日軍進犯、決非易事、</p>
<h3>日僞佈吿　今日開放南市　誘致居民復歸限期一年　法租界續開鐵門無消息</h3>
<p>南市開放、喧傳已久、日僞方面、雖亟欲達其開放後搜括榨取目的、但尙多顧慮、因之法租界新開河開放不久、忽父禁用十月·十一月·十二月之偽市民證、是亦足見其雜亂無章、詛昨日起、南市各處又發現上海方面日本陸軍指揮官及偽「市長」之佈吿、謂於一月二十四日（即今日）起、開放日暉港以東之南市、恢復交通、惟仍須</p>
<p>僞市民證　及居住證、誘使兩租界及滬西之舊居南市市民、復歸南市，并定一年爲限，否則認爲自行放棄權利、至於法當局屆時是否將予開放南陽橋·老北門·新北門·等處鐵門、尚未見有何凖備、惟日僞方面、確已於上述各處路口、將原有市房</p>
<p>修葺完竣　已添設僞警派出所及預備日軍憲兵等駐宿之川、於開放鐵門時任檢查警戒防務、外傳南市開設賭台及售賣烟土、截至二十三日止、未見舉動、惟花會賭博則殊盛行、無知市民、</p>
<p>受害甚烈　此外南市除原有中華路。小南門外·之僞南市警察署外、最近於南市製造局路一八一號添設斜橋警察署、僞署長爲前巡道街之金殿揚、同時在難民區沉香閣又添設邑廟警察署、由</p>
<p>前業星相　之武振亞爲署長、與原有之南市警署鼎足而三、乃南市市民又多二層剝削、此中玄虛、殊非局外人所能知曉、所有南市中華路。民國路·環城四週路旁前華商</p>
<p>公共汽車　站、近忽已新漆紅綠標識、站頭路名、及二十一路公共汽車等字樣、據云、將於鐵門開放後、由日商華中公共汽車公司主持行駛公共汽車、</p>
<h3>開放長江遷延不決　外商已不重視　美輪停航已久無意經營旣使開放貨運亦難起色</h3>
<p>日軍爲謀緩和美國對日空氣計、宜傳開放京滬間之揚子江航運、首定二月一日實行、今已改至三月、吾如期實現、尙難價測、茲悉洋商航商、對於日方宣傳開放京滬間長江一段之傳說、視爲日方意欲使</p>
<p>美國歡悅　但恐美國亦未必見情、因實際上、美商現下並無行駛長江之船隻、戰前曾有美商捷江輪船公司、係行駛川江·湘河之淺水輪、停航已久、故開放長江、對於美商航運利益毫無、即其他商業、</p>
<p>利益甚徵　對於英商則峪有利害關係、因英輪行駛長江船隻尙多、惟開放至首都爲止、亦表不滿、因京滬間有鐵路可通、貨運一節、萬難起色、故英商亦並不十分重視、據英商航業界之意、如能放至</p>
<p>蕪湖爲止　則航運略有生意、吾則亦屬徙然、故對於停航已久之江輪、至今尙未作開航準備、但長江尙米開放、而行駛於下江之（啟東海門）英輪、已遭遇阻撓、日海軍藉口有游擊隊、日艦不時無故向岸上開槍、致港內駁船</p>
<p>不敢駛出　因此行駛北沙之兩公司輪隻、近來時常空船往返、又聞近另有英商華倫洋行之瑞泰輪、由前經理葡商德耀輪之蔡某等承租、行駛北沙各港、尙能裝載貨物、當有諒解、</p>
<h3>邁爾西愛路　昨發生暗殺案　塗堃山中二彈傷無大碍　祥生汽車被刦似經借用</h3>
<p>現任法商電車公司買辦上海人凃經山之弟凃堃山、年約五句左右、精通法文、娶一法國籍女子爲室、向在漢口亞細亞公司仟買辦、自上年</p>
<p>漢市淪陷　涂堃山即挈同眷屬等避難轉輾來氾、賃居於法租界邁爾西愛路三○一號愛司德公寓六號房間、凃以寓居滬市、閒暇無事、担任某大學敎授職務、昨晨、凃在寓起身後、於七時左右、循例出外、</p>
<p>甫出公寓　大門、向南行未數步、突有汽車一輛、由北向南駛來、駛近凃之身傍、該汽車中有一男子執手槍伸出車窗、對凃連開三四槍、凃之右手臂及右腿、均被擊中一彈、受傷踏跌倒地、兇手見目的已達、即命司機者</p>
<p>開足速率　向南逃逸、凃於踣地後、由巡捕查見、電話報吿法捕房、即派探四出兜捕、兇手已遠颺無蹤、遂山探將凃車送廣慈醫院醫治、惟傷非要害、可無生命之虞、但凃堃山之</p>
<p>被撃原因　現正由法捕房調查之中、此案發生後、捕房又接得鮮生汽車公司報吿、謂於淸晨五時半左右、公司中應法租界某小旅館之召、派出一八五一六號照會汽車駛往、即有乘客四名上車、命</p>
<p>駛至滬西　極司非而路開納路相近處之空地傍、四乘客迫令車夫停止、幷驅逐下車、即强剝車夫所穿號衣、幷予綑縛、由四乘客中之一偕另一人駕車而去、至七時後、該被縛之車夫、經人</p>
<p>爲之解縛　返回公司報吿被刦車經過、至八時後、該被刦汽車在滬西靜安寺路大西路方面發現、由公共捕房通知祥生公司派人將車駛回捕房、對祥生公司汽車之被刦、與凃堃山被擊、是吾有運帶關係、現正着手偵查中、</p>

<h3>糧食限制粉價在進行中　麵粉昨未繼續上騰　整票交易仍遭拒絕　小麥貨主居奇尤甚</h3>
<p>麫粉市況、漲風稍戰、查二號粉廠盤、仍站十元原價、迄未變更、當局鑒於粉價狂漲不已、平民生計、更感威脅、事關地方治安、故決予以限制、聞正通吿各廠、售價不得超過十元、又據廠家談論、局方前已一度通知各廠限價丸元、但結果依然提高一元之巨、昨日各廠對於本街零批、雖照原價、允予供應、而限制則吏爲嚴厲、凡有大票交易者、悉遭拒絕、客盤則繼續擯持不開、故其嚴重性、仍未消滅也、惟回籠貨野盤、因聞當局將實施制裁、且廠家對於以前打出之棧單、迭經催促出貨、限於年底前一律出淸、故市面稍見疲弱、車船牌棧單價開十一元三角半至四角、而綠砲車仍有十一元七角半之高盤、足證市面尙未澈底軟化、二十叫日有粉運厦門九千包、</p>
<p>小麥市况、自經前日漲至十九元五角之高價後、亦可謂登峯造極矣、蓋以連日出口帮及華廠日廠均有納胃、致市面拾級上騰、聞二十元之售盤、不久亦可公開、其漲風殊堪驚人、日昨開市、貨方居奇允甚、嗣以工部局限制粉價及回籠粉、市面漲風稍戢、人心漸吿平息、故明盤仍以十九元五角及十九元之價、配廠貨的計二三千包、棧單貨交易亦有三四車、市面前途終屬易漲跌難、二十四日運厦門麥一千九百八十八包、</p>
<h3>手貨求售　米市漸虛</h3>
<p>昨日天時圍晴、粳米途次所阻之貨、絡繹抵埠、惟仍須由虹口區轉出、方能抵達界內、計有靑泗等薄稻一二千包、及南港早晚稻叫五百包、到貨旣漸見夥、人心遂呈虛弱、故早市一般稍有手貨之客販、都謀急脫、奈作客亦均具戒心、不敢多進、且回籠貨允見充斥、供過於求、市勢愈疲、跌風頓起、獨厚粳因貨稀、且成交無多、未有榮辱、其他如靑泗特薄祗開三十九九元七八角、南港早晚稻開三十八元八角、决爲三十八元半、較前悉降二三角不一、蘆羊尖朱見出樣、白元去路亦平、平疲之色、至於西貢籌各檯洋米、客販雖以匯水緊縮、及銀根等關係、售意仍堅、但銷塲已懈、成交寥寥、迄收盤、雖如陳西貢等猶以脚地較固、尙居原盤、原根貨一號做開三十九元五角至三十九元三角、二號做開三十八元四五角、而回籠貨一號西貢僅開三十九元三角連佣、二號開三十八元二角至三十八元、火紋米三十七元八角、决至三十七元半、比前見貶二角左右、東京砶計落三五角、暹羅米　以及香港糯　、均小一三角不等、統計全市成交數僅四五千包而已、</p>
<p>洋米產價雖無上落、而水脚則自三元三角加至五元半、相差二元二角之鉅、故一二號定價吏難接近、即碎米電訊亦須卅五元以上、新交易勢難妥交、回籠碎米尙有售出、價則喊高二元、結果加一元八角、先後成交二百噸、均爲三十五元、現米納胃甚呆、且以早薄稻回小、市價不能如回籠碎米之騰漲、</p>
<p>又訊洋米源源而來、到滬者已迭誌本報、昨日又有意輪孚錫喬瑪（譯音）號山西貢運來二萬三千二百三十八包、昨晨七時許進口、停靠虹口華順碼頭起卸上棧、聞該項洋米、係本市合義與達孚兩洋行所經辦、其中有九千一百十五包、須轉運汕頭、</p>
<h3>紗花　多頭重來收買　紗市前進</h3>
<p>紗市依然平靜、良以香港帮對於二一支·二三支及三二支·四二支紗綿需要、雖無大量交易、然零星採辦、續而不斷、因此人心振作一步、故外棉雖跌風奇熾、市塲未受若何影響、同時本年同業中大都獲利、而純益之鉅、可說財源茂盛達三江、結賬以後之銀款、與其存藏銀行中、不如買些貨物爲上、於此一來、市况非但不虛、反見平定矣、</p>
<p>現紗晨開因海外世界三大棉市致下挫且跌勢尤劇、人心平常、二十支雙馬開價爲七百廿八元、跌三元、豈料價格一鬆、多頭擯持、仍不放棄、某某等多頭反來收進、旋聞外匯微縮、買氣　盛、市盤逐步前進至七百三十六元、迨至收盤有一部份多頭吐出、又回下三元、查半日間成交統計一千六百七十五包行情二十支雙馬漲二元、天女漲二元、雙地球漲二元、昨永安廠開出十支特金城二百包價爲五百九十元、今日有紗一千一百件運厦門、茲將各帮口買去之額量分列如左、</p>

<h3>世界棉市　一致下降　本棉尚能站住</h3>
<p>本棉交易、依然靜寂、此因歐美三大棉市、一致下降、人心虛弱、不過外匯又見緊縮、兩相抵平、廠方需要杜絕、惟靑島方面稍有採辦、蘇北來源、計通花一千一百十四包、茲將現棉成交情形錄左、</p>
<p>另訊、外棉市價、紐約棉市、昨日晨初開盤、即形軟弱、先因利物浦來電低落、後因華爾街及海外棉商之在市拋賣、一部份倒限價了結者亦頗衆、結果收盤市况猛跌、較之上日降落二十餘磅音、印度蓮同預測跌三羅比餘、埃及停市、利物浦跌二十餘便士、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、昨日又因各方謠言紛起、匯兌轉緊、外棉交易因之轉爲靜寂，同業間均無交易開、廠方亦俱無意購辦、日方廠商未豆動辦已久、　昨日市况殊爲沉　、茲將昨日棉市以美匯七元　五折合送廠價如下、</p>

<p>桂元肉零星近有被到、咋聞號方開出數件、特高大片一百八十六元、决之一百六十元、據產區息、辦價仍在上展、蓋貨底日見單薄所致、預料春市或須再緊云、</p>

<h3>談談我兄弟手足之情　共同服務二十餘年</h3>
<p>— 佛</p>
<p>我兄弟共四人，長號子鶴，七歲嗣出，已故；决兄師竹，十三歲而殤；蘊和其行二矣。余與蘊和相差僅三歲，故我兄弟名爲四人，而六十餘年來共居處，共作事者，祇我兄弟二人而已。</p>
<p>兄愛靜，我好動，兄性柔，我性剛，兄愛讀書，我好游戲，故兄十七歲而入泮，我二上四歲而採芹，兄愛讀書，故所交盡屬讀書士子，我好游戲，故所交多半里巷頑童。志趨旣殊，薰蕕各別，少年手足之情，故未見若何穠厚也。</p>
<p>兄早讀書，早能自立，故十八歲而娶妻，余晚讀書，晚始成就，故二十四歲而成家。成家之後，兩人分餐，而並不分家；家素淸貧，固無家之可分也。人有兄弟析產而致反目者，我兄弟從無語談及經濟問題也。其時兄在融齋書院讀書，余往曹娥謀食，暌離之時多，聚首之日少，我兩人相親相愛之情，固無川見也。</p>
<p>巾報原爲　外商美查公司剏辦，光緒季年，該公司無意經營，乃山席君子佩接辦，是申報由外人辦理而改歸華人辦理之始。席君接辦後，欲大加整頓，乃聘金君劍花爲總主筆，請家兄蘊和，雷君君曜，孫君玉聲，共襄筆政，余亦濫竽其間，月作社論五六篇而已。是爲　我兩人共同辦事之始，亦即爲　我兩人操記者生涯之始。</p>
<p>其時維新　法之說甚盛，余喜石行文字，故在館不及一年，即考人南京高等學堂肄業，兄不久亦由學憲調入江陰南菁書院讀書。南菁書院者，由學憲於歲科考，挑取各縣優秀之士，肄業其中，故大江南北，優秀人才，多集於此，旋又考送北平京師大學堂肄業。其時滿淸政府，倡言變法，縣立縣學，府立府學，松江擬創辦府學堂，乃由府太守派家兄赴日考察學制。及歸，對於吾松府中學堂，多所規劃，而並不居任何名義也。在此數年中，我兩人各自求學，各奔前程，聚首之時，固米易多得也。</p>
<p>迨光緒三十一年，余興家</p>
<p>兄，同入南方報館，共同擔任編輯撰論之職。年餘，因登載振貝子娶名女伶楊翠喜事，致攖慶親王之怒，勒令停辦。慶親王者，振貝子父，時爲軍機大臣，兼總理各國事務大臣，素　西太后所倚畀。該報本爲　上海道蔡乃煌所創辦，經理爲珍妃之兄，志君贊熙，妃見惡於慈禧后，后西巡時賜死，沉於井中，故故宮中有珍妃井。其兄贊熙，遯跡滬江，爲　某洋行軍裝買辦，而兼南方報館經理，則該報本係半官報性質，不得不宣吿停辦矣。</p>
<p>時申報編輯，正感乏人，席君子佩，孫君東吳，堅邀余往。余以志君尙擬恢復該報，約余等不得他就，難之，子佩强之冉，因的以回松休息兩月再來就事，藉以觀志君是否尙能恢復舊業也。在此兩月中，發生，席君又促余到館，余於是第二度重入申報矣。未及半載，孫君東吳，因事他去，席君乃聘家兄蘊和主持筆政。自是而後，三十餘年，政局雖變，居停雖易，而我兄則未嘗或離也。（未完）</p>
<h3>改良賣票揩油的我見</h3>
<p>— 煥鈞</p>
<p>從前住在南市，乘坐華商電車從未見過賣票揩油，也難得上租界，所以對於租界電車和公共汽車賣票揩油的印象還不深。八一三以來，一住租界二年多，差不多每天和那些賣票員接觸，對於他們揩油的行爲，感到印象很壞，以爲這種不良習慣，實有改革的必要，決不能任其長此下去。筆者義昔服務南市華商電車公司，對於該公司賣票員不揩汕的原因，知之很詳，爰貢獻一點意見，以備社會人士作參考之資。</p>
<p>（一）待遇較優：華商賣票員在待遇上確較兩租界爲優，除工資較高外，一月中另外加四天升工，逢星期日有雙工之規定，年底則有一個多月的獎勵金，因公司營業年有盈餘（連電氣部份），每年則有三個月左右的花紅拿，他如五年儲金，由公司每年另給四十八天的工資，作爲　員工的儲金，外加利息規定一分，五年期滿本息一併發給，所以賣票員做了一年，可得二十個月的工資，因爲待遇旣優，他們都願求永久服務，而不願揩汕。</p>
<p>（二）自動制止：雖商賣票員方面的組織，也較兩租界嚴密一點，而且公司當局也不能像英商法商的獨斷獨行，凡與自身利益所關，必竭力以爭，他們旣時向公司有所交涉，就不願給公司一種藉口，而不利自身的進行，所以全體自動制止揩汕，如發現有揩油行爲　的，就羣起棄之，迫具退出工會，不得享受和其他賣票員同樣的利益，這也是賣票不揩汕的主要原因。</p>
<p>（三）股東監察：公司爲股份性質，資本最高額達八百萬元，所以大小股東無慮千萬，他們大都居於南市，進出乘車的很多，如發現賣票有揩汕情事，股東就可抄錄該賣票員的號碼，報吿公司，輕則罰扣工資，重則停職，這也是賣票不揩油的次要原因。</p>
<p>其他像路綫短，車輛少，查票多等等，自然也有關係的</p>
<h3>雨過天青</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>十回　世界交通同文共語　兒童敎育獎學憐才</p>
<p>現在歐美人硏究東方事物的很多，對於中國地理歷史，也覺得有研究的價値，也不會再鬧出那種笑話來了。從前歐美有許多學者，傲慢自大，不大瞧得起中國人，以爲中國並沒有眞正學者。文學上也只有做做八股，寫寫詩賦，其他的科學，一點也不明白。後來只不過有幾倘留學生，到西洋來，拾一點皮毛而已。但現在他們也覺悟了，中國並不是沒有學者，中國到處都是學者。中國的學者，一向是被埋沒了，此刻都出世了。而且中國學者，硏究種學問，都能精進。發明一種技術，都很靈敏，並不弱於歐美各國的學者。因此近來的歐美學者，都很尊重中國學者，而到中國來與中國學者共司切磋學問的人，也逐漸增多了。况且中國是一個新興之國，需求開發的地方正多。因此之故，對於各種建設，都需要人才，而足爲　學者們的材料的，在中國更爲　富足咧。爲了交換敎師，交換學生，而一年年歐美學者，到中國來的很多。他們有許多都想學習中國話，瞭解中國文字。譬如會說了中國話，到中國內地去旅行，也便當得多了。識了中國文字，便可以硏究中國固有的學問，以及閱讀中國的地志史事，也不至於鬧出了孔夫子拖辮子的笑話來了。這些歐美學者，到中國來時，經金澹雲嚮導的很少。因爲　他們來了以後，都是到中國的各大學裏，或是由文化機關招待，不需要嚮導員的了。偶然也有幾位學者，不過初來時領導他們一下，以後也就不需要了。金澹雲這一回結婚，所發的請帖，只不過較爲親近而住居在上海的外國人，邀他們來吃喜酒，此外也不去邀他們。這些外賓，都是夫婦同來者居多。其餘蘇　雅太太的朋友也不少，這些都是美國人，不過蘇理雅太太在中國的朋友，金澹雲大概都認識的。林建成的外國朋友雖小多，可是在上　的英法美幾位建築工程師，他大半也都認識的。所以今天這個萬國大飯店的禮堂上，擠滿了不少的中西來賓。都是來觀禮的，其實現在結婚的禮節，也楚極簡單的，他們結婚登記，早已向市政府婚姻局辦妥，也用不着什麼結婚證書。　（二三一）</p>
<h3>義務廣吿</h3>
<p>— 仁</p>
<p>小時候看魔術，感到最驚奇的是「空盃取米」，因爲　一隻空空如也的盃子，用布輕輕一遮，就變出滿滿的一盃白米，那個魔術師還恐觀衆不相信這一盃滿滿的都是米，就由助手張了一隻銅盤，把米全數傾倒下來。那時候實在年紀小，空盃能够取到塡飽肚子的白米，怎不驚奇不止呢？</p>
<p>但是年齡是年年長大了，而且學識經騐也跟着增進，於是知道魔術師不是天神，「空盃取米」的關鍵就在用布一遮之間，瞞過了我的眼睛，那隻盃子是「夾底」的，米早已藏在「夾底」之內。之後魔術也漸漸地講究「大套」，這些「小玩意」是祇能騙騙孩子的。</p>
<p>可是事實也並不盡然，前一時的報上就有兩家米舖子在要這套魔術，他們在升籮底層塡上馬糞紙，糴米的雖然不是孩子，可終究被他們「夾帶」了過去。而且這魔術的爲用至廣，不但固體的米可以「夾帶」，就是流質的液體也能舉、反三，如昨天報上有二家糟坊又應用了這套魔術的原理，在油勺內墊上鉛皮，實行「揩油」。</p>
<p>這四家店舖，能够在大人們面前要這個「花巧」，雖然同樣利用夾底一的關鍵，可是比魔術師祇能騙騙小孩的精神是偉大得多了，因之，乞編輯先生允許我佔去一點篇幅，替這四家舖子做一次義務廣者，以廣宣傳，這四家舖子的地址是</p>

<h3>President Chiang Kai-shek Issues Letter to Friendly Nations, Stating Japan Not Only Invades the Mainland and Seizes China Exclusively, But Also Seeks to Eliminate the Rights and Interests of Various Countries in the Pacific; Friendly Nations Should No Longer Indulge the Ambitious; Also Issues Letter to the Nation's Military and Civilians</h3>
<p>Chongqing – President Chiang Kai-shek issued a letter to friendly nations on the 23rd, as follows: On the 22nd of this month, various Hong Kong newspapers published the "Outline for Adjusting New Sino-Japanese Relations" recently signed in Shanghai by Japan and Wang Zhao-ming. The value of this agreement itself is insignificant, and naturally not worth considering. However, the ambition of Japan revealed in its promulgation is extremely important to us. I, Zhongzheng, would like to respectfully inform the governments and peoples of our friendly nations of my views. Japan's foreign policy focuses solely on military force and disregards good faith. As a result of its three wars against China, Russia, and Germany, it has obtained the most substantial rewards. Japanese warlords thus regard war as their most profitable business, and the status of Japanese soldiers within their country has become unparalleled as a result. Since the September 18th Incident, Japan has become a country completely controlled by warlords. The ambition of Japanese soldiers has always been to conquer the world. This ambition is detailed in the Tanaka Memorial, which is known to the world. The main point of the Tanaka Memorial is: "To conquer the world, one must first conquer China; to conquer China, one must first conquer Manchuria and Mongolia." This is the main purpose of the Tanaka Memorial and the only national policy of Japan under military rule today. China deeply understands the wild ambition of the Japanese soldiers, so it has launched a war of resistance against Japanese aggression at the cost of everything, in order to punish this troublemaker who disrupts world peace. China also firmly believes that only China's war of resistance can protect China's survival and prevent Japan from using China's resources and manpower to conquer Annam, India, Central Asia, the Philippines, the South Seas Islands, and other countries in the Pacific, so as to achieve its goal of conquering the world. Looking back at 1915, when Japan presented the Twenty-One Demands to the government of President Yuan Shikai, enlightened people in Europe and the United States were shocked and recognized that if Japan's ambition to destroy China was not curbed, it would inevitably harm the world. Therefore, after World War I, the Nine-Power Treaty was established, which confirmed the principles of open door and equal opportunity, and aimed to respect the completeness of China's territorial and administrative sovereignty in order to ensure peace in the Pacific. However, it was not long before Japan's old habits reappeared, and the September 18th Incident occurred. However, some people in European and American friendly nations still could not deeply believe that the Japanese soldiers truly had the dreamlike ambition to implement the Tanaka Memorial. Even today, they may still believe that the Japanese warlords have suffered major setbacks during the two and a half years of war against China and should have realized something. We also deeply hope that they will regret their mistakes. However, the facts show the opposite. Following the Twenty-One Demands, the "Outline for Adjusting New Sino-Japanese Relations" has appeared before us today. The serious nature of this so-called "Outline for Adjusting New Sino-Japanese Relations" is something that the era of the Twenty-One Demands, which sought to subjugate China, could not have imagined even in the slightest. The "Outline for Adjusting New Sino-Japanese Relations" is an agreement that the Japanese warlord government attempts to conclude with the puppet regime it intends to create. According to its provisions, everything in China, including its internal affairs, diplomacy, military affairs, finance, economy, trade, transportation, aviation, resources, education, and culture, is placed under Japanese control and supervision. In other words, these provisions are tantamount to placing all of China under Japanese protection. This violates the spirit and text of the Nine-Power Treaty in every aspect and is tantamount to fundamentally destroying the Nine-Power Treaty. Japan's intention to exclusively occupy China's economy, block China's doors, and eliminate the economic, industrial, and commercial opportunities of all countries in China is to encompass China and use China's resources and manpower to conquer the world and dominate the Pacific, so as to realize its plan in the Tanaka Memorial. This is already obvious. When Japan invaded and occupied our Northeast Manchuria, the world may have thought that Japan would not immediately attack Guannei and invade all of China's territory, because Japan needed considerable time to digest it after forcibly occupying the Northeast. But what is the reality now? If China had not risen up and resolutely resisted during the past two and a half years, I am afraid that not only Annam, India, and the South Seas Islands, but also the Philippines and other places, would not be as safe and sound as they are today. Since Japan launched its policy of aggression on September 18th, the friendly nations have repeatedly lodged the most serious protests against Japan's actions based on the position of the Nine-Power Treaty. However, Japan has ignored all of them. Its fundamental contempt for the public opinion of friendly nations, international covenants, and the public opinion of the world has been clearly revealed. Japan still claims that it intends to adjust diplomatic relations with the great powers. In fact, Japan's true intention is nothing more than to use deceptive means to obtain the recognition of the great powers for Japan's unilateral tearing up of treaties, ignoring the legitimate rights and interests of all countries, and establishing its so-called "New Order in East Asia." Now, looking at the agreement it has concluded with Wang Zhao-ming, it is sufficient to fully prove that the Japanese warlord government will further deceive the friendly nations and fundamentally cancel the rights and interests of the friendly nations in China. In other words, Japan will brazenly disregard everything in order to engage in the establishment of its so-called "New Order in East Asia." Its ambition of aggression has been exposed without reservation. Japan, in areas outside its sovereignty, arbitrarily stipulates the conditions and circumstances of the "New Order" and recognizes itself as the source of power and the master of destiny in that area, and refuses to resolve various issues with the countries concerned in accordance with the legitimate procedures of free negotiation and agreement based on justice and reason. All of this is sufficient to prove that Japan has no sincerity whatsoever in respecting the legitimate and fair rights and interests of the countries concerned. Japan is now intensifying its efforts, on the one hand, striving to create a puppet regime in China, and on the other hand, signing an agreement with the puppet regime that is still being created, in order to organize the so-called "Japan-China-Manchukuo Economic Group," and placing China's politics, economy, military affairs, diplomacy, culture, etc., under Japanese rule, so that all activities of other countries in China are subject to the blows of Japanese national policy, and fundamentally cancels the status of all countries in East Asia with this "Outline for Adjusting New Sino-Japanese Relations." Moreover, the Japanese ambition revealed in the content of the agreement is not limited to this. Looking at what it stipulates, "(North China and Mongolia should be established as a zone of strong Sino-Japanese integration in terms of national defense and economy. In Mongolia, in addition to the above, a special military and political status should be established due to anti-communism.)" In order to achieve the purpose of joint anti-communism, "(Japan will station the necessary troops in the key areas of North China and Inner Mongolia,)" and "(separately conclude a Sino-Japanese anti-communist military alliance with China.)" In addition, Japan should have special rights to develop and utilize the resources of North China and Mongolia. Japan reserves its military requirements and supervisory rights for railways, aviation, communications, and major ports and waterways within the areas where Chinese troops are stationed. Moreover, under the pretext of a joint anti-communist military alliance, it can station troops throughout China and never withdraw them. Not only that, but Japan can also send the necessary advisors, especially to control everything within the zone of strong integration. All of this is nothing more than using joint anti-communism as a pretext, and its purpose is to permanently control China and dominate the Pacific. What is noteworthy is that Japan, on the one hand, concluded this secret agreement on joint anti-communism and dominating the Pacific with Wang Zhao-ming on December 30 last year, and on the other hand, proposed the request for a temporary US-Japan commercial agreement to the United States and exchanged the extension of the fisheries agreement with the Soviet Union and conducted negotiations on concluding a Soviet-Japanese treaty and delimiting the border. How it is playing with the friendly nations, how sinister its intentions are, and how despicable its methods are. Is there still the slightest international good faith to be said? As for "(establishing a zone of strong Sino-Japanese integration in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River in terms of economy,)" "(establishing a special status on specific islands on the southern coast of China,)" "(Japanese warships and troops can be stationed and anchored in specific locations along the Yangtze River and on specific islands in southern China,)" etc., and "(all measures taken by China in relation to third countries shall not violate the principle of mutual cooperation among Japan, China, and Manchukuo,)" it is not only that China's diplomatic power is completely controlled by it, but also that all resources and trade are trampled on by it, and all industrial, financial, economic policies, and tariff systems and rates are completely controlled by it, and aviation, transportation, communications, shipping, river transportation, etc., are completely monopolized by it, and even Shanghai is designated as a Japanese sphere of influence, and Hainan Island and Xiamen are designated as special areas, etc., all prove that Japan's purpose is not only to invade the mainland and exclusively occupy China, but also to eliminate all the rights and interests of various countries in the Pacific, and has even threatened the territories of various countries in East Asia, and India, Annam, the Philippines, and other places cannot be exceptions. From this, it can be seen that Japan's current attempt to adjust diplomatic relations with countries in the Pacific such as Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union is not a genuine intention to adjust diplomacy, but only to deceive various countries, hoping that they will not take active actions against Japan during the Sino-Japanese War. Therefore, it spares no effort to prevent and undermine the cooperation of various countries. If Japan can truly exclusively occupy China and utilize China's resources and manpower, then Japan will not only advance north to attack the Soviet Union, but will also advance south to invade the territories of Britain, the United States, and France. The final stage of the fantasy of the Japanese soldiers described in the Tanaka Memorial is the time. Therefore, China has always firmly believed that China's war of resistance is directly protecting the freedom, independence, and survival of the Chinese nation, and indirectly protecting the interests of the friendly nations in the Pacific and their future security. Therefore, the responsibility borne by China's war of resistance is, on the one hand, to prevent the 450 million Chinese people from being reduced to slaves of the Japanese warlords, and on the other hand, to prevent the friendly nations from being forced to wage war against Japan in the future to protect their own security and freedom. The magnitude of China's sacrifices in this resolute war of resistance does not need to be repeated, and its significance and value are sufficient to affect the welfare of the world and have such a profound relationship. How can the friendly nations regard it as a simple war between two countries again? Now that Japan's ambition has been revealed to this point, it is all the more obvious that the friendly nations should no longer indulge the ambitious under the guise of onlookers or neutrality. I hope that the friendly nations will pay close attention to the fact that Japan's mud feet are now deeply mired in the Chinese quagmire. China is now doing its utmost to strike at the only public enemy in the Pacific and the common scourge of mankind in the world. We deeply hope that the friendly nations, both the government and the people, will thoroughly recognize Japan's entire ambition and the fundamental problems in the Pacific.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>"Compromise Document Handling"</h3>
<p>Gao Zongwu and Tao Xisheng revealed in Hong Kong on the 21st of this month the compromise documents taken and copied in Japan. According to Gao Tao's letter, they participated in the negotiations, some documents were handed over by hand, some matters were discussed, and the signing took place on December 30. According to Tokyo news, the compromise documents were taken to Tokyo by a certain key figure on the Japanese side at the beginning of this month; up to the 8th, the steps of passing through the Asia Development Board, approving by the cabinet, and reporting to the Prime Minister were completed one after another. According to what has been reported in Shanghai and Hong Kong, Gao Tao's departure from Shanghai to Hong Kong also took place at the beginning of this month.</p>
<p>The Wang side defended this, claiming that the documents released by Gao Tao were only unilateral proposals from the Japanese side in the middle of the negotiations, neither the earliest demands from the Japanese side nor the final results of the negotiations, but fragmented records taken out of context. It also claimed that Gao Tao had not participated in the recent negotiations. It also claimed that anything that could not be accepted by the Chinese people, anything that would harm China's freedom, independence, and survival, would never be accepted. It also claimed that the basis for the recent peace plan was unknown to Gao Tao. It also claimed that a formal peace could only be signed in the name of the "Central Government" and could only be announced in the name of the "Central Government."</p>
<p>The above is highly controversial. The truth and falsehood in between can be analyzed and judged by anyone's subjectivity; as for objective conclusions, we still await concrete corroboration; if we emphasize or suppress our words, praise or criticize the events, it will not be enough to increase or decrease the good and bad in between, nor will it be enough to benefit or harm the facts in between. Because from our point of view, the matter concerns the life and death of the Chinese nation, its nature is supremely serious, and its impact is supremely far-reaching; it is by no means something that can be guaranteed by the sincerity of the Japanese, the true meaning of peace, or the beliefs of Wang Jingwei; that is, it is by no means something that can be entrusted solely by relying on such guarantees; therefore, regardless of whether the compromise documents in Japan are true or false, regardless of whether the content of the compromise in Japan is generous or cruel, it is not the key to the life and death of the Chinese nation, but only a compromise of the compromisers. The determination of life and death depends entirely on the victory or defeat of the war of resistance. There must be peace in war, but Japan must admit defeat, or at least admit that it cannot win, before it can guarantee survival and seek peace; otherwise, there is no way to guarantee avoiding the conditions for national subjugation or quasi-national subjugation, or avoiding immediate death or chronic death. Today, although Japan knows that it cannot win, it has not frankly admitted that it cannot win; Wang believes that Japan cannot win completely, and that China has already been defeated; this is Wang's unique view, and whether it is right or wrong is not discussed here, but it is only because Wang's attitude and mentality are like this that even if the content of the compromise is not exactly as Gao Tao revealed, it must be vastly different from the conditions under the belief of the Chinese military and civilians that the war of resistance will be won. Then, is it not possible to pursue the truth of the compromise conditions today!</p>
<p>Let us take a step back and assume and speak further. Wang has his firm belief in peace, trusts the sincerity of Japan, and is confident that the conditions will not harm China's independence and freedom, and even feels that such conditions are also difficult to obtain; however, the conditions on paper, the iron reality, and the undisguised coming years are three stages rather than one thing. In other words, all self-defense and self-confession are not enough to increase or decrease the good and bad, or to benefit or harm the facts, nor can they change the general public's perception and feeling of the conditions. Because the problem of life and death is greater than everything, and the interests of the country and nation are more important than everything, so what is the comparison with a few feet of people; therefore, if the compromise conditions are concretized into a state, the facts under the conditions must be the standard for measuring everything, not one's own yardstick, nor the so-called sincerity, belief, and theory to explain everything. Ha Jia, Gu Xin’nan, and Pu Yi, although they coexist in the current moment, their subjective beliefs may be similar, but their current situation is different, their evaluation is different, their future is different, and their destination must also be different. Observing Wang and the conditions for compromise under the peace movement is also the same.</p>
<p>The similarities and differences between the "compromise document" and the compromise conditions are certainly impossible to analyze here, but based on the combination of Gao Tao's revelation and Wang's defense, there is at least one thing that is beyond doubt: that is, the so-called "Outline for Adjusting New Sino-Japanese Relations," even if it is not a document signed by both parties, is at least the true face of the Japanese proposal. The "Outline" lists various aspects of politics, economy, diplomacy, culture, and transportation to put China to death and wave away all countries outside the door. It is a confession of its attempt to swallow China alone, and there is no room for concealment. It was submitted on November 5, 1939, that is, 330 to 340 days after Konoe's declaration (no land, no sovereignty, no reparations) and peace symphony, only eight sentences ago. There is nothing that is not wanted. We trust Wang's defense, saying that the "Outline" is not the document that was signed, but Japan has repeatedly insisted on it to the extreme. How can we not ask when the so-called Japanese sincerity began? Saying that if it is like this, it is still possible to negotiate to the point where freedom and independence are not harmed, is this not a miracle of ancient and modern times? Moreover, freedom and independence have a certain definition and a certain appearance. Wang and others, if they are not afraid of Japan's undying ambition and the lack of good faith, and still do not give up their belief in peace, then we ask to abandon what Gao Tao revealed, and first see the compromise conditions of freedom and independence, and then look at the spirit and form of freedom and independence!</p>
<p>Correction: In yesterday's editorial, the word "February" in the tenth line "hoping to be at the commercial expiration date on February 26" is a mistake for "January."</p>
<p>And if the common disasters of various countries are not resolved by taking the opportunity now, then nurturing paralysis will lead to disaster, and it will be too late to regret. At this time when Japan's national power is exhausted, the politicians of various countries can eliminate the permanent and endless disaster in the Pacific with a single wave of their hands. If they abandon this plan and allow Japan to grow stronger, then even if they use the lives of hundreds of millions of people and trillions of dollars in money in the future, I am afraid that they will not be able to save this monstrous catastrophe. Then the politicians of various countries, whether in protecting the fundamental interests of their respective countries or in maintaining the culture and peace of the world, will not be able to escape their historical responsibility for thousands of years. We sincerely hope that the friendly nations that have close relations with the Pacific, regardless of whether their views and interests on European affairs are different, have no contradictions and conflicts in the status of the Far East today, and their goals are not different, and their interests are the same. They should be open and honest, cooperate together, and quickly take effective actions to stop Japan's aggression, and not affect the fundamental cooperation in the Far East due to other trivial issues, and give Japan the opportunity to grow stronger, and leave a great disaster. We even more earnestly hope that the friendly nations, who in the past unintentionally sold financial resources, materials, and war equipment to Japan due to trade relations, and enabled Japan to continue its aggression against China and massacre innocent Chinese civilians, will quickly take effective measures to cut off the source of Japan's materials and weapons raw materials, so that the legitimate order in the Far East can be restored as soon as possible. We deeply believe that if the friendly nations can earnestly assist China's war of resistance and immediately impose an embargo on Japan, then Japan will not be able to continue its aggression against China, and the Japanese army will inevitably withdraw from Chinese territory. The justice, peace, and stability of the Far East are in the hands of our friendly nations with abundant financial resources and military resources. The politicians of the friendly nations with a broad vision and the people of the friendly nations with abundant common sense will not regard our words as the Milky Way, and will rise up together to act as a shield of justice, (23rd telegram)</p>
<p>Chongqing – President Chiang Kai-shek issued a letter to the nation's military and civilians, roughly saying: Recently, the documents disclosed by various Chinese and foreign newspapers include the "(Japan-Wang) Outline for Adjusting New Sino-Japanese Relations," which was signed in Shanghai and brought back to Tokyo by Inukai Ken, as well as the necessary conditions for proposing the establishment of a puppet government to the Japanese side, and the other side's response. After reading these documents, the compatriots across the country must have a further understanding of the conspiracy. From the disclosure of these documents, we can understand the general situation of the secret proceedings conducted by the Japanese and puppet parties in the past few months, and we can also understand Wang's attitude of bargaining. Before we saw this document, we already knew, now that this document is disclosed, I want to ask the compatriots across the country to pay serious attention to the content of this document, and then read my speech pointing out Konoe's statement in December of the previous year, and then compare the so-called "(Japan-China New Relations Adjustment Outline)" with Konoe's statement, and you can know that what I said when criticizing Konoe's statement more than a year ago, "(What Japan really wants is to completely annex our country and fundamentally eliminate our nation,)" and "(Konoe's statement is the total confession of all the wishful thinking conspiracies of the Japanese to completely destroy China, dominate East Asia, and then conquer the world,)" can be proven to be correct today, and it is by no means an exaggeration. I once told everyone that Konoe's statement secretly hides mechanical blades in its bones. Now that the mechanism is activated, the blades are fully exposed. This Japan-China New Relations Adjustment Outline concretizes every word of Konoe's statement (New Order in East Asia). This Japan-puppet agreement is even more than the Twenty-One Demands and more vicious than the means of destroying Korea. I dare to believe that any Chinese descendants of the Yellow Emperor with a little blood and a little intelligence will be enraged upon reading this document. First of all, please pay attention to what is meant by "good neighborly friendship," which is "(Japan-China merger,)" what is meant by "(joint anti-communism,)" which is "(permanent garrison,)" what is meant by "(economic cooperation,)" which is "(economic monopoly.)" This is what Konoe's statement hopes for the soon-to-be-established "(puppet China.)" Imagine that murderers in the world force the killed to extend their necks for execution, which is already violent enough, but they also force the dismembered to carve out their lungs and internal organs on the surgery bed. Isn't this an unprecedented unheard-of event in ancient and modern times? I do not bother to list the contents of this document one by one, I will only briefly list its main points, (1) please see what its principles contain, the first is to (build a new order in East Asia) under the ideal, mutual good neighborliness and (combination), setting up) Japan-China-Manchukuo) general cooperation, good neighborly friendship to the point of (combination), isn't this (the realization of Japan-Manchukuo-China inseparable, (The day the East Asian Co-prosperity Sphere is established is not the day the independent country of China is eliminated. It is determined to delineate North China and Mongolia (originally Mongolia) as a zone of strong integration for national defense and economy, and to set a special military and political status in Mongolia. May I ask whose national defense is this so-called national defense, the national defense of China. China's territory is to be used for Japan's national defense, creating a zone of strong integration and setting a special status. Can such a China still be considered an independent country? It is determined that a zone of strong integration for the economy will be established in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. What is this (strong integration), is it glue, is it lacquer, or is it the so-called (integral whole) that is inseparable. To put it more clearly, yours is mine, to put it even more clearly, everything in China belongs to Japan. Everything that China has, Japan should occupy it. Furthermore, it is determined that special status will be established on the islands along the coast of South China, thereby closing China and prohibiting free communication with overseas countries, turning our southern barrier into a stepping stone for the other side to enter and exit the South Seas, and into a base for Japan to fight against Europe and the United States in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. These are the inviolable principles of the "(Japan-China New Relations Adjustment,)" and these specific items will be specified in more detail and more viciously in other annexes.

<h3>"Asama Maru" Incident: Japan Lodges Strong Protest with Britain, Acknowledging that the Actions of the British Ships Ruin Relations Between the Two Countries and Reserve the Right to Extradite the German People.</h3>
<p>Tokyo - The Japanese government has lodged a strong protest with Britain regarding the "Asama Maru" incident. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs released the following public statement at noon today: "Regarding the inspection of the 'Asama Maru' by British warships, Vice Minister Tani invited British Ambassador Craigie to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 10:50 PM on the 22nd and presented the Imperial Government's views and protest regarding this incident. (1) At 0:50 PM on January 21st, at a location 35 nautical miles off Nojimazaki, Chiba Prefecture, a British warship ordered the Imperial vessel 'Asama Maru,' which was returning to Yokohama from Honolulu, to stop. It stopped at 0:54 PM at a location of 34 degrees 34 minutes north latitude and 140 degrees 31 minutes east longitude. The British warship then dispatched three officers and sailors onto the 'Asama Maru.' Without explaining the detailed reasons for the rights under international law and without clearly stating the name of the warship, they demanded the extradition of 21 German nationals on board. Although the captain of the 'Asama Maru' refused this request, the British warship, using its military force, was able to prevent the aforementioned German passengers from being detained. (2) The Empire has always adhered to the principle, generally recognized on the high seas, that the extradition of nationals of one belligerent country on a neutral country's vessel by another belligerent country is limited to those currently enlisted in the military. The British side was well aware of this, but they knowingly violated it. In the Empire's coastal waters, the British warship took the aforementioned forceful measures against the Empire's vessel. This must be considered a major unfriendly act by the British side against the Empire, and the Empire Government attaches extreme importance to this incident. (3) The Imperial Government cannot tolerate the measures taken by the British Navy this time. Regarding this matter, we must urgently request a full and substantiated explanation from the British Government. The Imperial Government hereby expressly reserves the right to demand the extradition of the detained Germans. (4) The current actions of the British side have caused great agitation in the Empire's public opinion. Given this fact, if such actions continue to occur frequently in the future, the feelings of the Empire's people towards Britain will inevitably worsen. The Imperial Government hereby hopes that the British side will give deep consideration to the overall situation of Anglo-Japanese relations." (23rd Domei dispatch)</p>
<p>London - After the Japanese government lodged a protest with Britain regarding the "Asama Maru" case, the British government authorities are studying the main points of this protest document. According to responsible sources, British warships have the right to inspect neutral countries ships on the high seas, and the procedures of British officers were swift and courteous, which is also recognized by the Japanese side.

<p>Tokyo Newspaper Boasts and Intimidates England Harshly</p>
<p>Tokyo - The Japanese government lodged a strong protest with Britain yesterday due to the British warship capturing 21 Germans from the Japanese ship "Asama Maru." This morning, all the newspapers supported this move. "Asahi Shimbun" stated that Foreign Minister Tani Masayuki met with British Ambassador Craigie from 10:50 PM to 11:25 PM last night and read the Japanese government's protest to him. The British Ambassador replied that he would immediately convey it to his government and respond after careful consideration. However, he had to say that the British government believed that what the British warship had done was only recognized by international law. "Asahi Shimbun" also stated that there were three other Japanese ships that might also experience the same incident. "Miyako Shimbun" carried a resolution from a certain political party stating that the actions of the British warship were an extremely humiliating act against the Japanese Empire and the Japanese people. The Japanese government's appeasement policy towards Britain and the United States has led to this national shame, which we cannot forgive. "Kokumin Shimbun" stated that the "Asama Maru" incident occurred at a time when Japanese businesses in the United States are about to be abolished. This is a plot by Britain and the United States to test Japan's reaction. If Japan adopts a weak attitude, Britain and the United States will obviously take further and tougher measures. (23rd Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo - Many newspapers here advocate taking a tough stance on the "Asama Maru" incident. "Hochi Shimbun" believes that if Britain admits that its actions were inappropriate, the incident can be resolved peacefully. If Britain insists on its unilateral provocative attitude, Japan will be forced to take retaliatory measures. "Nichinichi Shimbun" states that Britain must be responsible for any situation that arises from the "Asama Maru" incident, as Britain's actions are clearly a deliberate provocation against Japan.

<p>Hong Kong - A Tokyo dispatch stated that officials from the Japanese House of Peers and the House of Representatives began work together today. Kiyose Ichiro, a member of the House of Representatives from the Current Affairs Comrades Association, asked Speaker of the House Oyama to submit the following questions to the government regarding the "Asama Maru" incident: (1) Was the British warship's interception of the "Asama Maru" legal? (2) Was the warship's action an unfriendly act towards Japan? (3) Does the warship's interception of a Japanese ship near the Japanese coast damage Japan's prestige? The Speaker believes that the "Asama Maru" incident is extremely serious and that all members should pay close attention to the progress of the matter. Once the situation is clear, unified action will be taken. (23rd dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo - Due to the occurrence of the "Asama Maru" incident, the Great Harmony Association, a fiercely patriotic organization, passed several resolutions today, advocating: (1) Prohibiting British merchant ships from sailing between Japan and the Chinese seas. (2) Punishing the crew of the "Asama Maru" who allowed the British warship to detain 21 Germans. (3) The Japanese Navy must adopt a tougher attitude to maintain its prestige. Afterwards, 300 members of the association gathered near the British Embassy, hoping to demonstrate to the British Ambassador, demanding that the British side release the 21 German sailors as soon as possible and demanding an apology from the British government. However, the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department, fearing an incident, dispatched a large team of police to surround the British Embassy, advising the members of the Great Harmony Association to abandon the plan to demonstrate. Therefore, nothing happened. However, a representative of the Great Harmony Association was received by a junior official from the British Embassy. (23rd United Press dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Naval Authorities Hold Meeting to Decide on Necessary Steps to Avoid Recurrence of This Event</h3>

<h3>Commercial Treaty Expires Tomorrow - Japan Flatters the U.S. to Issue an Imperial Edict Today - Not Levying Discriminatory Tariffs on American Goods</h3>
<p>Tokyo - The Ministry of Finance announced this afternoon that, in view of the expiration of the U.S.-Japan commercial treaty on January 25th, and regarding this matter, the U.S. government notified the Japanese government on July 26, 1939, to abolish it, the U.S. government has now taken steps to ensure that all tariffs on goods exported from Japan to the United States remain the same as before. Therefore, the Japanese government has decided, in accordance with Article 3 of the Tariff Law, to promulgate the following imperial edict on January 24th: From January 26th, a customary tariff will be temporarily implemented on American goods imported into Japan. According to the provisions of the Tariff Law, the import tariffs for all American goods will be temporarily levied according to the customary tariff. However, this shall not apply if the tax rate levied under the provisions of the Tariff Law is lower than the customary tariff. Articles 1 and 2 of the regulations for implementing the Tariff Law shall apply to the goods subject to the aforementioned customary tariff. (23rd Reuters dispatch)</p>

<h3>American Reporter Young Still Not Released</h3>
<p>Tokyo - Since being detained on Sunday, Paul Younce, the Far East director of the American International News Service, has not yet been released, and the charges are unclear.

<h3>Prominent American Christian Figures Issue Joint Declaration - Upholding Justice and Safeguarding Human Civilization - Moral Condemnation Alone is Insufficient</h3>
<p>Washington - Thirty-three important Christian figures have issued a declaration, stating that Christians in neutral countries cannot remain neutral in the current international conflict. Justice and freedom are still the reality of civilization, and the fundamental difference between a system that replaces justice and freedom with cruel tyranny cannot be ignored. The victory of the Allied countries and China, even if it does not guarantee the establishment of justice and peace by itself, the victory of Germany, the Soviet Union, and Japan will inevitably lead to the elimination of justice, freedom of thought and belief, and the international cooperation on which the Christian world order is based. If the United States does not understand the deeper issues involved in this conflict and express sympathy, and prepare to contribute to a better future, it cannot hope to fulfill its responsibility in determining a just and stable peace. The so-called contribution cannot merely be in the form of moral condemnation and lofty doctrines to guide other countries, but must be a national responsible participation in this long and painful transformation. The New York Bulletin published this declaration on its front page and added an editorial to elaborate on it, saying that this appeal is a new sign of the gradual decline of pacifism currently embellishing the United States. Among those who signed this declaration are prominent figures such as the chief pastor of the Congregational Church, the president of Yale University, and the president of Brown University.

<h3>Former Swiss President Motta Dies</h3>
<p>Bern - Motta, who served as President of Switzerland four times, passed away today at the age of sixty-nine. Motta was born on December 29, 1871, and is survived by ten children. In 1920, he was elected Honorary President of the League of Nations and subsequently became closely involved with the League, attending every meeting. In 1934, in his capacity as Swiss Foreign Minister, he delivered a speech at the League of Nations General Assembly opposing the Soviet Union's accession to the League, which was widely regarded as a well-constructed masterpiece. Judging from its content, one of the reasons for his doing so was that he was a devout Catholic. A few days later, Soviet representative Litvinov attended the League of Nations General Assembly, and Motta again used the opinions of the majority of people in Geneva to represent Switzerland at the League of Nations Executive Council, demanding that all Swiss citizens' losses during the war due to the actions of the belligerent countries should be compensated in full by the responsible countries. This decision was not successful and was criticized by the belligerent countries, even France. Shortly thereafter, he protested at the League of Nations over the recruitment of Swiss citizens as members of the neutral security force in the Saar, as the Swiss government opposed this move. Switzerland had adopted a tendency not to interfere in European politics since 1870, so it had political relations with only a few foreign countries. After the end of the European War, Switzerland joined the newly established League of Nations through a referendum, and this policy could not be implemented. Therefore, it established a Ministry of Foreign Affairs and took charge of it to deal with the new problems encountered by Switzerland. (23rd Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>German Steel Magnate Wolff Dies</h3>

<h3>Italian Minister Without Portfolio Attacks Jews</h3>
<p>Rome - Farinacci, a member of the Supreme Council of the Fascist Party and Minister Without Portfolio, recently delivered a radio address to the nation's youth, fiercely attacking the Jews, saying, "All the suffering that humanity is currently experiencing is caused by the crimes of the Jews. The various principles on which the French Revolution was based are the cause of the Jews' ability to enjoy power in the modern world. Today, England, America, France, Switzerland, Belgium, and the Netherlands are all in the hands of the Jews, and their future fate is truly sad. Only Germany and Italy, through the efforts of National Socialism and Fascism, can resolve the Jewish crisis. The Italian government is determined to continue this action with great perseverance in order to achieve complete success." (23rd Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>Britain and France Have Military Preparations in the Near East - Soviet Red Star Newspaper Publishes an Article - Stating That Its Significance Cannot Be Ignored</h3>
<p>Moscow - The Red Star newspaper, the organ of the Soviet General Staff, published an article today stating that the Allied forces stationed in Egypt, Palestine, and Syria, exerting pressure on potential enemies of the Anglo-French group in the Mediterranean and the Balkans, cannot be ignored in significance. This force, led by French General Weygand and British General Wavell, is in fact an expeditionary force threatening the southern flank of Germany. This Balkan front does not exist, but the British and French are creating it. This is part of the Anglo-French plan. The Anglo-French group's military preparations in the Near East and political preparations lead us to believe that what we are encountering is not a restraining action, but a far-reaching strategy.

<h3>European Small Nations Determined to Maintain Neutrality, Not to be Enticed by Any Side, Expressing Surprise at Churchill's Remarks</h3>
<p>Amsterdam: The "Telegraaf" here expressed surprise and regret regarding British First Lord of the Admiralty Churchill's remarks urging small neutral nations to join the Allied forces against Germany, stating that Churchill's words would be more easily understood if directed at the United States, Italy, or Japan. The Netherlands, in any case, is determined to maintain its neutrality, and this stance will not change even as Germany clearly heads towards collapse. It can be assured to Churchill that the Dutch people will never allow themselves to be attracted by any side. Another newspaper reported, "When we realize that self-defense is unavoidable, we will defend ourselves against foreign aggression, certainly not due to foreign enticement." (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>Copenhagen: The speeches successively delivered by British First Lord of the Admiralty Churchill and Foreign Secretary Halifax are highly valued here, but the general public opinion is mostly the same as that of Denmark, Sweden, and Norway, which is to absolutely maintain neutrality in the current European war. "Nationaltidende" reported that the national strength of small countries is weak and should be understood by the world's major powers. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<p>Bern: British First Lord of the Admiralty Churchill's recent broadcast speech, a section of which concerned the neutral countries, has been commented on by various Swiss newspapers. The "Basler Nachrichten" stated that Switzerland's neutral status is guaranteed by international treaties, and Britain is also one of the signatories and must abide by the treaties. The "Journal de Genève" also stated that Germany often does not hesitate to break international treaties to satisfy its own desires, but can neutral countries use this as a reason to automatically unite to help Britain and France in the war? Knowing that neutrality is the only guarantee of our country's independence, unless there is foreign aggression, we must not abandon neutrality. (Havas, 22nd)</p>
<p>Belgrade: Political figures here today severely criticized British First Lord of the Admiralty Churchill's speech, considering it a direct interference in the policies of neutral countries. These political figures pointed out that Churchill's words clearly seek to expand the scope of the war, and may even be deliberately aimed at the future Balkan Conference, which can be seen as Britain's declaration of its Southeast European diplomatic plan. (Haitong, 22nd)</p>
<p>New York: British First Lord of the Admiralty Churchill's recent broadcast speech has been commented on by political figures here, who generally believe that Britain's views on the current war are changing. Examining Churchill's speech, the criticism of the Soviet Union's aggression against Finland is extremely fierce, and judging from his tone, it is no different from indicating that Britain and France will sooner or later regard Germany and the Soviet Union as being in the same boat and view the Soviet Union as the second enemy. If so, the two major wars in Europe today have a high possibility of merging into one. At that time, Britain and France can obtain great psychological and military benefits. As for the section of First Lord of the Admiralty Churchill's speech involving the attitude of various neutral countries, it is indeed sufficient to explain the current situation, because most neutral countries are deeply and significantly affected by the current European war, and they all hope to improve their environment before the end of the war. Moreover, First Lord of the Admiralty Churchill once said that the fate of various neutral countries is intertwined with the fate of Britain and France. This point is undoubtedly correct, but the United States has always regarded itself as the protector of the interests of various neutral countries. Now that Churchill has hinted that certain neutral countries will find it very difficult to avoid being drawn into the vortex of war if they are not protected by Britain and France, this causes some unease in the United States. Furthermore, most people in the United States originally hoped that the scope of the current war would not expand. Now that they hear First Lord of the Admiralty Churchill strongly advocating that Britain and France are determined to fight to the end, they deeply know that this hope is gradually weakening. In short, political figures in the United States feel that the interests of various neutral countries will inevitably become more important in the eyes of the belligerent countries in the future.

<h3>US Communist Party Secretary Accused of Forging Passport</h3>
<p>New York: Earl Browder, the secretary of the Communist Party of the United States, was yesterday found guilty of fraudulently obtaining a passport and impersonation, and sentenced to two years in prison and a fine of one thousand dollars for each count. Browder immediately declared an appeal and was released on bail of $7,500. Although Browder hired a well-known New York lawyer to defend him, he still argued himself, saying that the government's accusations were complex and false. He said that he was a communist and was proud of it and had no apologies to make. According to this judgment, Browder must serve four years in prison and pay a fine of two thousand dollars, but if he behaves well in prison, the term can be reduced to three years.

<h3>Cold Weather in Finland Has Abated, Warfare Resumes Activity, Soviet Army Shelling Positions Day and Night, Attempting to Cut Off Finnish-Swedish Transportation Line</h3>
<p>Helsinki: On Sunday evening, 17 Soviet aircraft bombed Oulu, apparently trying to destroy the railway line north of the city. This railway line is an important railway line for Finland to obtain various supplies from Sweden and abroad. However, the Soviets bombed this road at two points. The Red Army on the Lake Märkäjärvi front is now beginning to move most of its military equipment and personnel eastward, towards the Salla area, or even further east. There are now 40,000 Red Army soldiers in the Salla area. According to Finnish officers, new Soviet troops with different faces and numbers arrive on the front line every two days. (United Press, 23rd)</p>
<p>Moscow: According to a communiqué issued by the headquarters of the Leningrad Military District, on the 22nd, there were small clashes between reconnaissance teams on all fronts, and artillery battles in some areas. The Soviet Air Force conducted reconnaissance flights. (TASS, 22nd)</p>
<p>Helsinki: The cold weather in southern Finland has abated, and the fighting on all fronts has resumed activity. In the Salla and Karelian Isthmus areas, the Soviet army is shelling Finnish positions, preparing for infantry attacks. The Soviet army near Taipale is attempting to implement a strategic encirclement. According to Finnish military experts, the Soviet army has likely stored huge amounts of ammunition, as the Soviet army continues to shell even at night. Finnish pilots report that Soviet tanks and trucks are advancing towards Kemi, apparently trying to cut off Finland's transportation with Sweden and the connection between Finland's north and south. The Soviet army has also built an air force base in Finnish territory, 20 kilometers from the Soviet border, at Vuorijärvi. (Haitong, 22nd)</p>
<p>Helsinki: Before launching another attack on Taipale yesterday, the Soviet army broadcast a message, threatening that Germans are now assisting the Soviet army and will kill all Finns, but it had no effect, because the Finns did not surrender to Soviet enticements and quickly defeated the Soviet offensive. The Finnish army also achieved victory in the fighting northeast of Lake Ladoga, repeatedly repelling the Soviet army. There is little official news about the fighting in the Salla area, but it is generally believed that the Finnish army in the area is currently holding the front line. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>Stockholm: Finnish authorities announced that when Soviet aircraft bombed various parts of Finland yesterday, they dropped as many as 6,700 bombs, but only 18 residents died and no more than 109 were injured. This is due to the Finnish people being good at taking shelter after the authorities issued air raid warnings. At the same time, material damage in various places is also very limited. (Havas, 22nd)</p>
<p>Helsinki: It is learned that when Soviet aircraft bombed the Soviet port of Kronstadt yesterday, a total of 30 aircraft participated in the operation. Soviet warships docked in the port could not move because the port was already frozen, and several ships were reportedly destroyed by Finnish aircraft. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<p>Tallinn: Officials have denied reports that Finnish aircraft bombed the Soviet base of Paldiski and the Soviet airfield near Tallinn yesterday. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Famous Czech Journalist Predicts Future of European Situation, Current War to Last at Least Three Years Before Large-Scale Offensive Determines Victory</h3>
<p>Manila: Mr. Morawetz, a famous Czech journalist who has accurately predicted international events, arrived here today. It is said that Mr. Morawetz will go to Australia. After the Munich Conference two years ago, Mr. Morawetz predicted Germany's annexation of Czechoslovakia, and later predicted the partition of Poland, and predicted that Italy would not participate in the war. According to what he said after arriving here, there is no possibility of a blitzkrieg in the current European war. This means that the European war will last at least three years before a large-scale offensive is launched to determine the overall situation. Otherwise, if Britain, France, and Germany each defend their lines, the war could last for as long as thirty years. After the end of the war, the peace conference may allow Czechoslovakia, Poland, or even Austria to reunite, but Germany will still acquire other territories to compensate for its losses.

<h3>Britain Interferes with American Shipping, US Issues Written Statement, Hopes to Take Steps to Correct Discriminatory Meaning, Secretary of State Hull Meets with British Ambassador for Talks</h3>
<p>Washington: The US government issued a statement last night accusing Britain of causing various inconveniences to American shipping in the Mediterranean. US Secretary of State Hull made an oral protest to the British Ambassador to the United States on January 20, and has now issued a written statement, the contents of which are as follows: "The US government is extremely concerned about the treatment of American ships in the Mediterranean, especially in the port of Gibraltar. The US government's position has been explained in the note issued on November 20. What is regrettable is that after the issuance of that note, Britain continued to interfere with American shipping, not only greatly delaying American shipping in the Mediterranean, but also, as a result, this action has obvious discriminatory implications. The surveillance system in the port of Gibraltar has long been established, and the inspection matters should be on track, but according to the information received here, ships sailing from the United States to neutral countries, or sailing back to the United States from neutral countries, are detained in the port of Gibraltar for nine to eighteen days, during which the mail is unloaded and some goods are forced to be unloaded in belligerent ports such as Marseille, thus causing delays of many days. According to reports, Italian ships suffer less difficulty and the number of days of delay is not as many as American ships. According to statistics from November 15 to December 15, 1939, American ships were delayed for an average of twelve days and ten hours, while Italian ships were delayed for only four days. Therefore, the US government believes that the British measures have discriminatory implications and hopes that the British authorities will immediately take steps to correct them."

<h3>US Senate Holds Memorial Service for Borah, Ceremony Solemn and Respectful, Remains Transported to Hometown for Burial</h3>
<p>Washington: After the death of Republican Senator and isolationist leader Borah, a memorial service was held in the Senate chamber this afternoon. President Roosevelt, the judges of the Supreme Court, the cabinet ministers, all members of the Senate and House of Representatives, and the diplomatic corps all attended.

It is heard that more than 300 passengers and crew members jumped into the sea and were rescued by lifeboats lowered from two other Italian mail ships and two French warships (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>Rome: "The cause of the fire on the Orazio is viewed with suspicion here. It is reported that after the ship left Barcelona, it was inspected by the French authorities for several hours on its way to Genoa. When the inspectors disembarked and the ship continued sailing, it suddenly caught fire. Although officials have not yet issued a statement, it is generally believed that the fire was caused by sabotage (Haitong, 22nd)</p>
<p>Paris: "After the Orazio caught fire in French waters, the German propaganda machine immediately blamed the French navy. People here have severely condemned this, saying that not only is the Italian government's statement not believed, but the actions of French warships and merchant ships in rescuing the victims are praised. It can be seen that the German claims are not worth refuting (Havas, 22nd)</p>
<p>Marseille: Regarding the fire on the Italian mail ship "Orazio", the French Navy Department recently formally notified the Italian Consulate here that all lifeboats have been found, and of the 650 people on board, only a few mechanics and laborers died, and the rest have been rescued.

<p>Sexual Hygiene</p>
<h3>From the Reproductive Desire of Animals</h3>
<p>— Yang Daonan, graduate of the Medical Department of the Labor Movement University of Russia</p>
<p>Speaking of human sexual life,</p>
<p>There are two distinctions from the reproductive impulses of animals. The first is that the sexual impulses of lower animals are completely governed by endocrine function. Furthermore, in humans, in addition to endocrine function, there is also the function of the central nervous system. In other words, sexual impulses have transformed from simple subconscious actions to complex mental actions during the process of evolution from animals to humans. Therefore, human sexual behavior is more complex than that of animals. This fact is supported by numerous examples in comparative anatomy and biology. No matter what kind of animal, the simpler the structure of its brain, the lower the level of sexual behavior that occurs. Conversely, the more complex the structure of the central nervous system and brain, the more mental influence on its sexual behavior, and the more similar it is to human sexual behavior. Therefore, the reason why simple animal sexual impulses evolve into complex human sexual phenomena is directly related to the development and evolution of the nervous system and brain. Therefore, the sexual impulses of animals with developed central nervous systems, such as apes, orangutans, and humans, are not only satisfied with pursuing the opposite sex to achieve reproduction. Especially in humans, there is also a desire to possess the pursued opposite sex, to live lovingly with them, and to run a life of love together. Therefore, humans are the highest animals.</p>
<p>Therefore, once humans lose their reproductive function, their cohabitation will be affected. The big ones will separate, and the small ones will turn against each other. Therefore, no matter what class of human beings, when they have problems with premature ejaculation, impotence, neurasthenia, inability to have intercourse, and infertility, they all urgently seek treatment. According to my many years of experience in treating venereal diseases, the above-mentioned symptoms are completely caused by the destruction of the youth glands that govern sexual desire due to masturbation or unrestrained sexual life. Therefore, people who masturbate excessively often suffer from nocturnal emission, spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, impotence, etc. Therefore, seeking treatment, ordinary preparations are not effective. You must take the German testicular essence (i.e., youth gland) preparation "Male Tonic" to completely cure and restore lost sexual power, and can promote the development of sexual organs and enhance metabolic function. At the same time, it can nourish the brain and blood. No matter how weak a person is, after taking "Tonic", they will immediately rejuvenate and return to youth. The female version has the effect of regulating menstruation and promoting fertility, and can also treat sexual frigidity. Women who are not interested in sexual desire will be cured by taking this.</p>
<p>The Spring and Autumn of Gonorrhea</p>
<h3>New Zealand Venereal Disease Hospital Announces Remarkable Treatment Results for Gonorrhea</h3>
<p>The New Zealand Venereal Disease Hospital publishes an annual analysis and statistics of various treatments for venereal diseases, such as electrotherapy, surgery, and internal medicine, all of which are rigorous. It is found that the only effective treatment for gonorrhea is "Klinon", a special medicine for gonorrhea invented by Dr. Peter of Germany. Dr. John Haville, director of the gonorrhea department of the hospital, made precise statistics. Acute gonorrhea can be cured in 3 or 4 weeks by men taking "Klinon" and using "Anti-Gonorrhea Water" externally. In women, 97 out of 100 people are completely cured. After more than 15 blood tests and prostate massage methods, it has been proven to be completely cured.</p>
<p>Dr. John Haville also used general chemical therapy and membrane penetration therapy for experiments, and found that only three or four people out of 100 were cured, and there was still a risk of recurrence. Therefore, "Klinon" has become a special medicine for gonorrhea unanimously recognized by homeopaths around the world.</p>
<p>Dr. Davis of the United States also published a report on the curative effect of "Klinon" in a hospital in Muncie, proving Dr. John Haville's statement. Dr. Davis said, "I have tried many drugs for treating gonorrhea, but the results are not as good as "Klinon". The reason is that the theory on which this medicine is based is the use of non-specific lesion therapy, which is very different from general chemical therapy and membrane penetration sterilization therapy. I use "Klinon" to treat acute and chronic gonorrhea in men and women, and the cure rate is 96.8%. No current oral medicine for gonorrhea has such a high cure rate." As for external medicines, you can use "Karshdy vaginal tablets" as suppositories, and wash yourself at home according to the instructions and illustrations, and you will succeed greatly. Since the invention of "Klinon", countless men and women suffering from gonorrhea have been completely freed from this suffering thanks to this medicine. Doctors should take note of this medicine.</p>
<h3>Lung Disease Should Be Recognized Early</h3>
<p>— Physician Sheng Zaiqiang</p>
<p>Most people with lung disease often cough lightly once or twice, or have severe coughing, decreased appetite, mental fatigue, and weight loss, and then tuberculosis becomes a disease. If effective treatment can be given at this time, a radical cure can be expected, and the effect is easy to achieve. If it is delayed until the severe second or third stage, it cannot be cured without a long period of time. Therefore, it is important for patients with lung disease to seek early treatment. However, it is also difficult to find a suitable oral medicine for treating tuberculosis, which is what I have always felt in my 20 years of clinical practice. It was only after Dr. Trumer of Germany invented "Pulmonal" that I suddenly understood. The efficacy of "Pulmonal" is to eliminate the oxygen of dangerous lung diseases, so that the tuberculosis bacteria lose their activity. Therefore, hemoptysis, coughing up phlegm, chest pain, night sweats, and tidal fever caused by tuberculosis will all disappear after taking it.</p>
<h3>An Earnest Admonition to Those Who Indulge in Self-Pollution</h3>
<p>— Dr. Zheng Ting, Medical Doctor of Germany</p>
<p>Regarding the question of how to determine whether a young person is masturbating, it is naturally something that most parents and teachers are extremely eager to know. The solution to this question cannot be achieved without long-term observation. As parents, one must first pay attention to carefully examining their habits, complexion, and state of health. Generally, if a young person has a pale complexion, a tired face, listless eyes, and dark circles under the eyes, these are all definite signs of masturbation. As parents, they should pay attention to whether there are traces of fluid left on their bedding, as masturbation can often lead to seminal emission. If such traces are found on the bedding daily or every few days, it can be considered masturbation or a morbid condition. This is because, within physiological limits, there is absolutely no phenomenon of seminal emission occurring once every three to several days. If it does occur, it is a morbid condition that requires treatment.</p>
<p>Masturbation can cause frequent seminal emissions and damage to the body and mind. Therefore, self-respecting young people should be vigilant at all times: if they are not doing it, they should strive to avoid it; if they are, they should change their ways. If health is impaired, with seminal emission and weakened brain function, it is advisable to take three "Nerves Seminal Emission Pills" before going to bed each day, which have the effect of stopping seminal emission that very night. No matter how frequent the seminal emissions or how severe the spermatorrhea, it will be immediately reduced after taking "Nerves Seminal Emission Pills." If the body is weakened, simultaneously supplement with the German endocrine tonic for men, "Body-Con," The two medicines taken together are remarkably effective.</p>
<p>Discussion on Gonorrhea</p>
<h3>Gonorrheal Cystitis</h3>
<p>— Written by Physician Yao Juyan</p>
<p>Consultation Hours: 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM</p>
<p>The causes of gonorrheal cystitis are numerous, but it mostly occurs during posterior urethritis due to stimulation from excessive drinking, labor, sexual activity, riding in vehicles, and not taking care of oneself, which causes gonococci to flow upward in reverse, invading the bladder from the posterior urethra, thus causing cystitis. There is frequent urination, with a large amount of sediment at the bottom of the urinal, lower abdominal distension, and hernia pain. Sometimes, there may be an inability to urinate. At other times, because gonococci invade the bladder and damage the blood vessels in the bladder wall, there is a risk of causing hematuria, so special attention must be paid at this time. In addition, complications of cystitis can also be said to be secondary complications, which often occur due to improper surgery, leading to nephritis, pyelonephritis, and other conditions, thus often causing unexpected dangers. This is what I have learned from many years of experience. Gonorrhea patients must not take it lightly, lest it be too late to save and regret it for the rest of their lives, which is a truly unjust thing.</p>
<p>For gonorrheal cystitis, one should not only adhere to local surgery but also think about solving it from the root. For internal medicine, one can take the German gonorrhea remedy "Klinon." This medicine is made by mixing protein with yellow pigment, so its efficacy can directly reach the lesion without harming healthy tissue, and there are absolutely no adverse reactions. It is very different from those who only know how to penetrate the membrane to kill bacteria and only make local repairs. After taking "Klinon," the inflammation can be eliminated and the original health restored. I further supplement it with bladder irrigation and German induced static electricity therapy, so that gonorrheal cystitis can completely eliminate the disease within a short period of time, with smooth urination, clear urine, and restoration of normal urination function, without any chance of turning into gonorrheal nephritis. Also treats venereal bubo, chancroid, and sexual neurasthenia. Consultation hours: 10:00 AM to 1:00 PM. 20 numbers are given out each day, with only 5 jiao charged per number, and a complete book on venereal diseases is given as a gift.</p>

<h3>The Strong Resistance Forces in North China: Observations and Impressions of a Neutral Observer</h3>
<p>A correspondent from the Continental Daily in Chongqing on the 16th of this month reported that the resistance of the Chinese army in North China is becoming increasingly strong, as confirmed by many neutral observers. According to a certain traveler who recently arrived in Sichuan from Beiping via the border region government area, his experience and impressions are as follows: "The Jin-Cha-Ji</p>
<p>Border Region Government was established in September 1938 as the Chinese administrative organ in the rear of the Japanese army. By August of last year, when the Chinese army advanced eastward and reached the Beining Railway, the Japanese generals paid more attention to the border region government and the guerrillas. The Japanese army in North China doubled its strength. The border region government had no choice but to withdraw from eastern Hebei, but its army suffered no losses. The Japanese army attempted to encircle and pursue it, but suffered heavy losses. In January of last year, the Japanese army reoccupied some of the larger cities and towns in Hebei Province, but failed to destroy the Chinese army in central Hebei and the area west of Beiping. Each time the Japanese army occupies an area, it is limited to key cities and roads where troops can be quickly transported. Nine-tenths of the land is still under the jurisdiction of the border region government.</p>
<p>In the past two years, the Japanese army in the area has lost at least 30,000 men. Guerrilla warfare requires a new type of political organization. Now, thanks to the efforts of the border region government, the cooperation between soldiers and farmers is extremely close. The Japanese army has failed to control the masses, not only because of the resistance of the guerrillas but also because of its own foolish means. Japanese warlords not only fail to establish an effectively functioning government but also take pleasure in using terror for revenge. For example, a certain foreigner witnessed many villages being burned down, and many villagers had their jaws pierced with iron wire and paraded through the streets before being burned alive. Furthermore, a certain missionary who recently traveled to North China obtained</p>
<p>evidence of Japanese barbarism, saying, "I love Japan, but the Japan I saw in China is not the Japan I love." Another foreign observer also stated, "In the Japanese army, from officers to soldiers, there is a prevalence of encroachment and illegal profiteering." The success of the border region government is due to the support and assistance of the people. The intelligence work of the Chinese army also relies on friendly Chinese people for supply. The Japanese army threatens and lures their spies, but these spies are always unreliable. Moreover, Chinese soldiers can quickly change into peasant clothes, while Japanese soldiers have no way to hide. The troops of the border region government have excellent discipline. The special banknotes they issue can be exchanged for legal tender, but if they fall into the hands of the Japanese, they are worthless. Cooperatives are established one after another, and their number increases daily, manufacturing many homespun cloths and daily necessities. Soldiers in the border region army who formerly belonged to the Red Army account for only 15%. The number of young officers is increasing daily, and they are non-partisan. Each team has political staff who emphasize mass education and training in self-government. Village councils have already been established. The offices of the border region government move as needed. Travelers who have been through the area all say that Japanese soldiers are getting worse and worse in terms of food and clothing. Japanese officers no longer have canned food brought from their own country to satisfy their hunger. Moreover, the number of capable officers in the Japanese army is now less than before. However,</p>
<p>the number of Japanese soldiers who desert is increasing. They are truly exhausted. Moreover, the Chinese army is fighting on its own soil, while the Japanese army is confronting a hostile people in a foreign country. The manpower and material resources consumed are enormous. In terms of endurance, China has all kinds of advantages."</p>
<h3>Japanese Merchants Again Absorb 30,000 Shi of White Rice in Suzhou</h3>
<p>Suzhou News: This county once saw rice prices soar due to the absorption of white rice by Japanese merchants, setting an unprecedented record. Later, the rising trend was curbed through mutual restraint among rice merchants. Unexpectedly, in less than a month, the Japanese special service organization here, at the request of Japanese merchants, instructed the puppet county governments of this county and Wujiang to purchase 30,000 shi of white rice, with a selling price of 27 Japanese yen per bag, it is said. Therefore, starting from the 15th, the puppet magistrate of Wu County, Guo Zengji, and the puppet magistrate of Wujiang, Zhu Yuanzhi, convened a meeting of rice merchants from the two counties. As a result, because the rice merchants were unable to cope, they were forced to have each township transport 1,000 shi to curry favor with the Japanese.</p>
<h3>After the Fall of Shantou, Residences and Shops Were Also Occupied; The Blockade of the Coastal Areas of Fujian and Guangdong Became More Tight; The People's Livelihood Was Withered; and Strong Young Men Competed to Enlist in the Army</h3>
<p>Shantou News: The blockade of the coastal areas of Fujian and Guangdong by Japanese warships has become a chronic disease. Foreign merchant ships cannot transport goods to Shantou, Xiamen, Guangzhou, Haikou, Beihai, Fuzhou, Quanzhou. Even Japanese merchant ships entering and leaving the port must first obtain permission from Japanese warships (known as "official ships"). One or two ships per week shuttle between the three lines of Shantou, Xiamen, Guangzhou, Shanghai, and Taiwan. The goods transported are extremely limited and are the monopoly of Japanese merchants. Therefore, Shantou commercial firms have completely ceased operations. Chaozhou and Shantou capitalists have moved to Hong Kong and Macau and dare not return rashly. Tokiko Kondo, the wife of Kondo of the Japanese Taiwan Development Company, arrived in Shantou last month and launched an investigation into the families of overseas Chinese. She sent Japanese pacification teams to various villages to offer condolences, register the correspondence addresses of Chaozhou people abroad, and send letters on their behalf. Recently, she also sent a certain Mr. Wang from Chenghai overseas to raise shares to establish a remittance company, aiming to absorb foreign exchange. However, under the blockade, all Chaozhou people feel extremely confused. When those who sought refuge left Shantou last year, they temporarily locked up their residences and shops. By the end of last year, most of them had been broken into by the Japanese, who occupied them like magpies nesting in doves' nests. Not a single piece of furniture or door or window was intact. After a few more days, the stairs, floorboards, and rafters inside the houses were also dismantled and used as firewood. This situation is even worse in remote villages. As a result, villagers have nowhere to live and have flocked to Shantou, causing a sudden increase in the number of pedestrians on the streets. However, the puppet organization is using this as propaganda material, claiming that the city of Shantou is becoming prosperous. In fact, the opposite is true. Since the 3rd of this month, fierce battles have broken out in the middle section of the Chaozhou and Shantou Railway. The Chinese army has attacked and entered Fuyang, Wuyang, and Fengxi. The Japanese army has retreated and defended the outskirts of Shantou, Anbu, and Chenghai City. The people of Shantou are greatly shocked. On the 6th and 7th, the Japanese army in Chaoan invaded Tiandong, Xucuolong, Elephant Head Village, Xitang, and other places, where they were ambushed by the Chinese army, surrounded, and annihilated more than 1,500 of them. Now they are lurking in Chaozhou City waiting for reinforcements. At present, Chinese army teams from Raoping, Fengshun, Jieyang, Chenghai, and other places are gradually narrowing the encirclement and strengthening the blockade line of the occupied areas.</p>
<p>Japanese warships have recently harassed various coastal areas, making feint attacks. Rumors are rife in Shenquan in Huilai, Jieshi and Jiazi in Lufeng, and Shanwei and Dapeng Bay in Haifeng. Villagers in each village and township are panicking greatly. Women, children, and the elderly have moved into mountain villages in advance to take refuge. On the morning of the 8th, a Japanese warship sailed into Shenquan Port, followed by a motorboat and an iron barge. At noon, a Japanese plane took off from the sea and dropped absurd leaflets over Huilai City. It also sent out motorboats to intercept fishing boats and cargo ships to inspect them. Small sailboats from the Fujian border and Shantou often sail on the Huilai sea, carrying local products such as tangerines, eggs, dried fish, tungsten, and copper immortals to Hong Kong, and then load matches, kerosene, medicines, and other goods from Hong Kong and transport them inland. The small sailboats travel along the mountainside, passing through Shenquan, which happens to be a central station. Japanese motorboats intercepted them there, looting all the eggs and tangerines on the ships. Those who resisted were set on fire. Several boats are intercepted every day. On the 9th, the warship left Shenquan and fired several shots at the shore. Two houses near Luwei were destroyed by the bombardment, killing and wounding three or four people. Due to the blockade by Japanese warships, the small boats in Lufeng and Haifeng have not dared to go out to sea for the past ten days. There is a shortage of materials in the market, and daily necessities have risen sharply in price. Kerosene is sold for 40 yuan per can (5 gallons), peanut oil is worth 105 yuan per white catty, superior rice is 2 catties per yuan, broken rice is 3 catties per yuan, sweet potatoes are 25 catties per yuan, flour is 35 yuan per bag, charcoal is 14 catties per yuan, firewood is 25 catties per yuan, and mountain grass is 50 yuan per yuan. The people's livelihood is extremely withered. People near the sea cannot fish, so their lives are extremely difficult. Therefore, strong young men in each village are unable to make a living and are enthusiastically joining the army, rushing to the front lines to resist the war in order to support themselves.</p>

<h3>Enrollment and Advancement Methods for the Second Departments of Various Normal Colleges: Two Methods Promulgated by the Ministry of Education</h3>
<p>(Chongqing Airline News) The second department of the normal college is established to enroll graduates of other university colleges with the same nature of the department, and to provide professional training to cultivate teachers for secondary schools. In the 28th year, various normal colleges failed to fully prepare and failed to universally enroll new students in the second department. It is heard that in order to prepare for the enrollment of normal colleges in the second department of the valley in the 29th year, the Ministry of Education has formulated "the 29th year enrollment method for the second department of each normal college" and ordered the schools to comply. In addition, in order to reward the volunteer corps of various service groups with university graduation qualifications to continue their studies and receive professional training, so as to create good teachers for secondary schools, the Ministry of Education also formulated a method for the volunteer corps of each service group to be sent to the second department of the normal college without examination. Teachers in primary and secondary schools in the war zone under the Ministry of Education can select members with the prescribed qualifications who are willing to study further, create their name list, and submit it to the Ministry of Education for verification before May 19th, together with various documents. The original texts of the two methods are as follows,</p>

<h3>Secondary School Graduates Lost Certificates The Ministry of Education Solves the Problem</h3>
<p>(Chongqing Airline News) During this period of the War of Resistance Against Japan, secondary school graduates often lost their graduation certificates due to war relations, and they have requested education administrative organs to provide relief. The Ministry of Education has now stipulated remedial measures. If secondary school graduates lose their graduation certificates and their original schools still exist, the original schools should issue certificates, which should be submitted to the competent education administrative organs for approval. If the original schools have been closed down or the competent education administrative organs cannot communicate due to traffic isolation, two recommendatory staff members or two other recommendatory civil servants from the competent education administrative organs may provide proof, but if it is discovered in the future that the proof is inconsistent with the facts, each proof-provider shall be held legally responsible,</p>

Another game was scheduled for the reserve group, East China vs. St. Francis, at 3:00 pm on Sunday afternoon at Jiaozhou Park,</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops Sneak Across Qiantang River, Zhejiang Remains Quiet, Chinese Troops Firmly Block, Japanese Scheme Unlikely To Succeed, Shanghai Market Affected By Rumors</h3>
<p>Following the Domei News Agency's report of Japanese troops sneaking across the Qiantang River in eastern Zhejiang, various Shanghai hometown associations have been inquiring about the truth. It has been confirmed that the coastal and riverside areas of eastern Zhejiang are as peaceful as usual, and shipping between Shanghai and Zhejiang remains smooth. However, a Japanese advance on Fuyang has been repelled. The alleged interruption of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway is unfounded. The Japanese also spread similar rumors in February of last year, which were later proven to only concern a Japanese attempt to seize Dongsha Island near Fuyang, which was ultimately blocked and repelled by the garrison. Therefore, it is believed that the Japanese propaganda is the same as last year. Nevertheless, the Shanghai market was affected by rumors yesterday afternoon, with public bonds falling and foreign exchange tightening, impacting other markets as well.</p>
<p>Coastal and Riverside Areas Remain Peaceful The Shaoxing Seven Counties Hometown Association telegraphed the Yuyao County Magistrate, saying, "Yuyao County Magistrate Lin, have the Japanese indeed crossed the river? Please reply by telegram. Shaoxing Seven Counties Hometown Association." As of last night, a reply had not been received. However, telegrams from Ningbo, Taizhou, and Wenzhou reported that everything was peaceful. Foreign ships anchored outside Zhenhai harbor telegraphed cargo unloading updates, without mentioning any Japanese landing in eastern Zhejiang, indicating that all is well in the coastal and riverside areas. Foreign ships sailing between Shanghai and Ningbo are operating as usual. The foreign ships anchored outside Zhenhai include the German "De Ping" (owned by the Sino-Italian Trading Company), the German "Mou Fu" and "Hai Fu" (owned by the Jebsen &amp; Co.), and the Italian "Bao Li" (owned by the Italian-Chinese Trading Company), all continuing to load and unload cargo as usual. The "De Ping" telegraphed Shanghai yesterday, reporting that it would leave Zhenhai tomorrow (the 25th) and arrive in Shanghai on the morning of the 26th.</p>
<p>Landing at Tou Peng Not Yet Confirmed A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency learned from the shipping industry and hometown associations yesterday that eastern Zhejiang's coastal areas, including Ningbo, Fenghua, Ninghai, Xiangshan, Taizhou, and Wenzhou, and the Qiantang River areas, including Xiaoshan, Shaoxing, and Yuyao, have long been heavily garrisoned and fortified, making a Japanese landing unlikely to succeed. Furthermore, long-distance and military telephones are available in all counties, so any attempted landing would not go unnoticed. Yesterday, Shanghai markets were rife with rumors that the Japanese had forcibly landed at Tou Peng San Che Dai in Xiaoshan County, opposite Haining County across the Qiantang River. The reporter's inquiries have not yet confirmed this. It was also rumored that the Bank of China had received a telegram from its Shaoxing branch reporting fighting in Xiaoshan, but the bank has denied this, stating that it did not receive any telegram from the Shaoxing branch. The reporter also learned that Japanese forces have recently attempted a large-scale advance and sneak crossing of the Fuchun River near Fuyang, but were repelled. The riverbanks at Tou Peng are muddy and heavily guarded, making a Japanese landing impossible. Therefore, it can be confidently said that the rumors are false. Furthermore, the local shipping industry sent a wireless telegraph inquiry to Ningbo the night before and received a reply stating that eastern Zhejiang was peaceful. These reports should reassure the Zhejiang people in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Operating Normally The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway from Xiaoshan to Jiangxi Province is operating normally and has not been interrupted. The stations at Wenjia Yan, Linpu, and Guangshan in Xiaoshan County are also peaceful. No artillery fire has occurred in Xixing. As for the highways in Zhejiang Province, except for those along the coast and rivers that have been deliberately destroyed, the highways from Jinhua to Lishui, Xinchang, and Quzhou are operating as usual for both passenger and freight vehicles. The Fuchun River is under martial law, making a Japanese advance difficult.</p>
<h3>Japanese Puppet Notice: Nanshi Opening Today, Luring Residents to Return, One-Year Deadline, French Concession Gate Remains Closed With No News</h3>
<p>The opening of Nanshi has been rumored for a long time. Although the Japanese puppets are eager to achieve their goal of looting and squeezing the area after the opening, they still have many concerns. The ban on the use of fake resident certificates for October, November, and December, shortly after the reopening of the Xin Kai He area in the French Concession, demonstrates their disorganization. Yesterday, notices from the commander of the Japanese army in Shanghai and the puppet "mayor" appeared in Nanshi, stating that the Nanshi area east of Rihui Port would be opened on January 24 (today) and traffic would be restored, but fake resident certificates and residence permits would still be required to entice former Nanshi residents from the two concessions and western Shanghai to return to Nanshi, with a one-year deadline. Otherwise, they would be considered to have given up their rights. There is no sign that the French authorities are preparing to open the iron gates at Nanyang Bridge, Lao Bei Men, Xin Bei Men, etc. However, the Japanese puppets have indeed repaired the original municipal buildings at the aforementioned intersections and have added puppet police outposts and barracks for Japanese military police to be responsible for inspection and security when the iron gates are opened. Rumors of gambling dens and opium sales in Nanshi have not been confirmed as of the 23rd, but flower gambling is rampant, severely harming the ignorant citizens. In addition, besides the original fake Nanshi Police Department on Zhonghua Road and Xiao Nan Men, a Xie Qiao Police Department has recently been established at 181 Zhizao Ju Road, with Jin Dianyang, the former patrol street chief, as the puppet chief. At the same time, a Yi Miao Police Department has been added to the Shenxiang Pavilion refugee area, headed by Wu Zhenya, a former astrologer. These three police departments stand side by side, adding another layer of exploitation for the Nanshi residents. The intricacies of this situation are not known to outsiders. The former Chinese public bus stops along Zhonghua Road, Minguo Road, and the ring roads around Nanshi have recently been repainted with red and green signs, with the names of the stops and the words "Route 21 Public Bus." It is said that after the opening of the iron gates, the Japanese-owned Huazhong Public Bus Company will operate public buses.</p>
<h3>Yangtze River Opening Delayed and Uncertain, Foreign Merchants No Longer Interested, American Ships Have Been Out Of Service For A Long Time And Have No Intention To Operate, Even If Cargo Transport Is Opened, It Will Be Difficult To Improve</h3>
<p>In order to ease the anti-Japanese sentiment in the United States, the Japanese army proclaimed that it would open the Yangtze River shipping between Jinghu and Shanghai, which was originally scheduled to be implemented on February 1, but has now been changed to March. It is still difficult to estimate whether it will be realized as scheduled. It is reported that foreign merchants and shipping companies regard the Japanese propaganda on the opening of the Yangtze River section between Jinghu and Shanghai as the Japanese trying to please the United States, but it is feared that the United States may not appreciate it. In fact, there are currently no American ships operating on the Yangtze River. Before the war, there was an American Jianglun Shipping Company that operated shallow-water ships on the Chuan River and Xiang River. It has been out of service for a long time, so the opening of the Yangtze River has no benefit to American shipping. Even for other businesses, the benefits are minimal. It is more advantageous for British merchants, because there are still many British ships operating on the Yangtze River. However, they are also dissatisfied with the opening only to the capital, because there is a railway between Jinghu and Shanghai, making it difficult to improve cargo transport. Therefore, British merchants do not pay much attention to it. According to the British shipping industry, if it can be opened to Wuhu, the shipping business will be slightly better, otherwise it will be futile. Therefore, the Jianglun, which has been out of service for a long time, has not yet made preparations for sailing. However, the Yangtze River has not yet been opened, and British ships (Qidong Haimen) operating on the lower reaches of the Yangtze River have encountered obstruction. The Japanese navy used the excuse of guerrillas, and Japanese warships often opened fire on the shore for no reason, so that barges in the port dare not sail out. Therefore, the ships of the two companies operating in Beisha often return empty. It is also heard that the Ruitai wheel of the British Wallen Yoko, rented by Mr. Cai, the former manager of the Portuguese Deyao wheel, is operating in various ports in Beisha and can still load goods, which should be understood.</p>
<h3>An Assassination Occurred On Avenue Messimy, Tu Kunshan Shot Twice, Not Seriously Injured, Xiang Sheng Automobile Company Reportedly Carjacked</h3>
<p>Tu Kunshan, the younger brother of Tu Jingshan, the compradore of the French Tramway Company, is about fifty years old and is fluent in French. He is married to a French woman. He was a compradore in the Asiatic Petroleum Company in Hankou. Since the fall of Hankou last year, Tu Kunshan took his family and sought refuge in Shanghai, renting Room 6 of the Aster Apartment at 301 Avenue Messimy in the French Concession. Since Tu was residing in Shanghai and had nothing to do, he took a position as a professor at a university. Yesterday morning, after Tu got up at his residence, he went out as usual at about 7:00.</p>
<p>As soon as he left the apartment building and walked a few steps south, a car suddenly drove from north to south. As it approached Tu, a man in the car held a pistol and stuck it out of the car window, firing three or four shots at Tu. Tu was hit in the right arm and right leg, and fell to the ground. Seeing that the purpose had been achieved, the murderer ordered the driver to speed south and escape. After Tu fell to the ground, he was discovered by a patrolman, who reported the incident to the French Concession Police Department by telephone. The police immediately dispatched detectives to search for the murderer, but he was long gone. The police then sent Tu to Kwong Tze Hospital for treatment. The injuries were not fatal and there was no danger to his life, but the reason for Tu Kunshan's shooting is currently being investigated by the French Concession Police Department. After the incident, the police also received a report from Xiang Sheng Automobile Company, stating that at about 5:30 in the morning, the company dispatched Car No. 18516 to a small hotel in the French Concession in response to a call. Four passengers boarded the car and ordered the driver to drive to a vacant lot near Avenue Haig and Route Kaufmann in western Shanghai. The four passengers forced the driver to stop and drove him out of the car, forcibly stripped him of his uniform, and tied him up. One of the four passengers and another person drove the car away. At 7:00, the tied-up driver was untied and returned to the company to report the carjacking. At 8:00, the carjacked car was found on Route Ferguson and Great Western Road in western Shanghai. The Public Concession Police notified Xiang Sheng Company to send someone to drive the car back to the police station. It is currently being investigated whether the carjacking of Xiang Sheng Company's car is related to Tu Kunshan's shooting.</p>

<h3>Over 30,000 Bags of Foreign Rice Continue to Arrive, Iron Industry Group Orders Rice, Employees of That Industry Need Not Worry Anymore, Other Industries Decide to Follow Suit</h3>
<p>Large quantities of foreign rice have been arriving in Shanghai in recent days. On the 22nd, the Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.'s "De Sheng" brought 3,000 bags from Shanhaifang, and 12,600 bags from Zhagang were unloaded at Ross Wharf. Yesterday, the British mail steamer "Frsijama" (phonetic) of the British India Steam Navigation Company arrived from Saigon with 23,238 bags. It arrived in Shanghai around 7:00 yesterday morning and docked at the Huashun Wharf in Hongkou for unloading. It is reported that the foreign rice was handled by both Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. and Louis Dreyfus &amp; Co. Among them, 9,115 bags still need to be transferred to Shantou.</p>
<p>Cheap Rice Arrives After the Shanghai Ping Tiao Committee entrusted the Rice Dealers Association to handle the Ping Tiao (price stabilization) from the 21st of this month, it has now decided to actively solicit Ping Tiao donations in order to continue the long-term Ping Tiao. 20,068 bags of rice purchased from the Shanghai market are taken out 2,500 bags every day and distributed to various Ping Tiao locations for Ping Tiao. As for the 1,500 tons (approximately 15,000 bags) ordered from Saigon, they are shipped to Shanghai in three batches. The first batch has arrived in Shanghai, and the second batch of 3,000 bags was transported to Shanghai yesterday by the Italian wheel "Frsijama" and has begun unloading at Huashun Wharf. The third batch of 9,000 bags is loaded on the Italian wheel "Samatra" and is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 26th.</p>
<p>Rice Order Shipped The Civil Food Regulation Association organized a group order of foreign rice to be shipped to Shanghai to regulate the people's food. The first batch of 600 tons (6,000 bags) has already arrived in Shanghai. Jin Cheng Bank is currently handling the payment and has completed the shipping procedures. It has already been distributed to the orderers and has notified the orderers to pay the rice money immediately, otherwise the association will sell the foreign rice on behalf of the orderers at market prices. The proceeds will be used to pay for the goods and all other expenses, and the surplus will be returned along with the deposit. If the deposit is not enough to cover the cost, the orderers will still be held liable for the deficit. Now the first batch of 600 tons has been shipped out in full by the orderers, and a batch of 1,000 tons (10,000 bags) has already been telegraphed for order.</p>
<p>Iron Industry Orders The Shanghai Iron Industry Association has convened various industry members to order 4,000 bags of Saigon No. 2 rice in accordance with the Civil Food Regulation Association's method, which is expected to arrive in Shanghai around early February. The industry also intends to sell it to employees at the original price when rice prices rise in the future, and transfer it at the lowest market price when rice prices fall. Therefore, employees in the industry need not worry about rice from now on. It is heard that other guilds, such as the hardware industry, steel bar industry, and old iron industry, have decided to order foreign rice in accordance with the iron industry's method. The Bean and Rice Industry Association yesterday notified its members that the members of the association had enthusiastically contributed to the Ping Tiao fund. Because the fundraising procedure is about to end, those who have not yet submitted their contributions should send them to Yong'an Yamen Xinfeng within two days for collection.</p>

It is reported that the four were sailors on the German ship "Likmmer".</p>
<h3>The State of Various Countries' Shipping to China in 1939, Japan Seeks to Dominate and Already Holds First Place, Shipping of All Countries Severely Impacted</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the Japanese Navy has blockaded Chinese coastal ports, forcing Chinese and foreign ships to completely stop sailing. Japan seized the opportunity to dominate shipping in China, refused to open the Yangtze River route, arbitrarily inspected foreign ships and obstructed navigation, detained Portuguese merchant ships under false pretenses, and confiscated Chinese merchant ships docked in various places. As a result, the shipping of all countries to China has been severely impacted. Britain, which had previously occupied the first place, has been forced to drop to the bottom. The governments of all countries attach great importance to this. The details of the merchant ships of various countries coming to and from Chinese ports in 1939 are as follows.</p>
<p>Main Countries Last year, a total of 117,696 ships and 29,827,908 tons of merchant ships from various countries entered and exited Chinese ports. The main countries are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Comparison of Customs The ten coastal customs in China have always been the largest. The shipping of various countries to China is centered on Shanghai. Shanghai ranks first in the entry and exit of merchant ships at customs throughout the country, followed by Jiaozhou and Tianjin. The various customs are listed on the left.</p>
<h3>Regulations of the Straits Settlements, Import Amount of Chinese Piece Goods Specified, Totaling Over 111,400 Dozen, No More Than 60 Percent to Be Imported in the First Half of the Year</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce received a telegram from the Ministry of Economic Affairs yesterday, stating that "According to the report submitted by the Consulate in Penang on November 27, 1939, 'After consulting the Straits Settlements Gazette Extraordinary, the Governor announced, in accordance with Section 3 of the Piece Goods Import Ordinance, the total amount of piece goods or piece goods products, etc. to be imported into Malaya from foreign countries in 1940. The total amount of piece goods allowed to be imported from our country is 111,455 dozen. However, the amount imported from January 1 to June 30, 1940, cannot exceed 60 percent of the total amount. All amounts of piece goods allowed to be imported into Malaya by the Straits Settlements Government next year are hereby submitted together with a clipping of the newspaper for your review, for your convenience.' One copy of the original newspaper clipping is attached. Please check and forward to the merchants dealing in piece goods so that they are all informed. Printed by the Ministry of Economic Affairs."</p>
<p>Attached is a copy of the original newspaper. The total amount of piece goods to be imported into Malaya from foreign countries next year has been announced. The amount imported in the first six months cannot exceed 60 percent of the total amount. Merchants should submit their license applications at the beginning of next month.

<h3>On Various Bridges of Suzhou Creek, There Are People Privately Exchanging Japanese Military Currency; The Ministry of Finance Cables and Orders All Fellow Traders to Be Warned, and to Investigate and Stop It at All Times</h3>
<p>According to reports to the Ministry of Finance, there have recently appeared people on various bridges of Suzhou Creek in this city who are exchanging Japanese military currency. The exchange rate is approximately 1.30 Legal Tender yuan for 1 Japanese military currency yuan. For smaller exchanges, it requires 1.40 Legal Tender yuan. It is said that one can profit 5 to 7 fen for exchanging 1 Japanese military currency yuan. However, in exchange shops on Sichuan Road, one only needs approximately 1,200 Legal Tender yuan to exchange 1,000 Japanese military currency yuan. Therefore, there are now more than 50 people setting up shop on bridges to engage in this exchange business, but none of them provide their names or store signs, etc., to the authorities. Investigations reveal that previous cables have repeatedly instructed compliance with refusing to accept and prohibiting the trading of Japanese puppet regime currency. Based on the previous report, another cable has been sent to warn fellow traders to investigate at all times and take measures to stop it.</p>
<p>Chinese culture has a particular fondness for Chinese stamps, and has collected many valuable Chinese stamps. In the field of medicine, it is deeply trusted by the Chinese people. Many important government officials have been cured by Dr. Luo. During the August 13th Shanghai Battle, Dr. Luo made significant contributions to serving Chinese wounded soldiers. When a bomb exploded in front of the Sincere Company, only Dr. Luo was the formal doctor on the scene to treat the injured. This is the reason why the government specially permitted naturalization during wartime, to thank Dr. Luo for his service to China.</p>
<h3>A Petition by the Boiled Water Industry; Decision to Provide Assistance; Turning to Kailuan Mining Company to Sell Coal at the Lowest Possible Price</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Boiled Water Industry Association, in order to alleviate the coal shortage and reduce the burden on fellow traders, in addition to issuing a declaration urging fellow member traders to abide by industry regulations and sell water as limited, also appealed to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, the Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Public Concession, and the Shanghai First Special District Citizens' United Association the day before yesterday, stating the four major issues of the industry and society, and requesting permission to forward a letter to the Kailuan Mining Company, continuing the previous method of registering to purchase coal, to directly wholesale coal at the lowest possible price to the industry for use. The above three organizations agreed to do so. Now, in order to actively proceed, the industry again dispatched the chairman of the association, Zhang Delong, the vice chairman, Yu Lianfa, and the supervisory committee member, Shi Xingli, yesterday to continue to petition prominent figures in the Shanghai business community, Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Ludeng, and Gui Yanfang. The representatives first briefly stated their intentions: (1) Allow forwarding a letter to the Kailuan Mining Company to sell coal at the lowest possible price to the industry for use; (2) Supervise all industries to participate in group coal purchases, return to Shanghai for storage, to prepare for unexpected needs; (3) Negotiate with the coal industry to sell all existing coal stocks at a reasonable price, so that there is an abundance of spot goods and the market price can be stabilized. The three gentlemen accepted and agreed to do so, and expressed deep sympathy for the difficult situation of the industry, deciding to turn to the Kailuan Mining Company to sell coal to the members of the industry as much as possible.</p>
<h3>Money Trade to Hold Executive Committee Meeting Tomorrow to Discuss Closing Accounts and Discount Rates</h3>
<p>The Money Trade Association, composed of 41 member money houses including Tongrun, Fuyuan, Fukang, and Anyu, whose business is purely for long-term credit loans for industrial and commercial enterprises, is now approaching the end of the lunar year of the 28th year of the Republic for overall account closing. In order to actively prepare various procedures and facilitate the handling of account closing, it has been decided to convene an executive committee meeting at the Ningbo Road Association at 2:00 PM tomorrow (the 25th) to discuss all important issues. At the same time, it is also planned to discuss the market conditions for interbank lending rates for the current month. The time for money houses to accept bills is usually based on the time of the Money Trade Joint Reserve. Now that the end of the year overall account closing period is approaching, money houses receive a large number of bills, but the buying time is extended. As usual, they should wait for the notification from the banking industry's bill clearinghouse before submitting it to the members' representative standing committee on the 2nd of next month for a decision, and then notify the money houses to comply. It is said that the reason for waiting for the notification from the clearinghouse is that the time for money houses to accept bills cannot exceed the regulations of the clearinghouse, in order to facilitate the handling of transfers and cash settlements.</p>

<h3>Western Air Pressure Attacks Shanghai; Weather Suddenly Turns Bitterly Cold; Temperature Drops to Five Degrees Below Freezing; Ice Formation Is Quite Thick; North Wind Is Extremely Severe</h3>
<p>Since the snowfall in this city a few days ago, it has cleared up since the night before last. At the same time, the weather in Nanjing, Hankou, and other places has also cleared up. The reason for the atmospheric clearing is due to the high air pressure in Northwest China, which is now advancing towards the Yangtze River basin and has reached the vicinity of Shanghai. Therefore, the climate in this city has suddenly become bitterly cold. The temperature heard at 5 or 6 o'clock yesterday morning dropped to 5.1 degrees Celsius below zero, only 22.5 degrees Fahrenheit, making it the first bitterly cold day of winter. Gutters and riverbanks have all formed layers of ice, as have water storage devices. The lake wind is biting, like a knife scraping the face, which is completely different from the warmth of the previous few days. As a result, the number of corpses of people frozen to death on the streets has greatly increased, and the situation is extremely tragic. Moreover, it is not easy for the poor to find food, leading to a surge in the number of people awaiting relief at the Da Gu Road porridge distribution point, exceeding 6,000 people, putting the association in a difficult situation to sustain. It is hoped that people in society will enthusiastically donate to avoid hardship and suffering, which would be an immeasurable act of merit.</p>
<h3>Stabbing a Waiter to Death; Perpetrator to Be Severely Punished</h3>
<p>Zhang Xueheng, Xue Jingeng, and a group of other Jiangbei people around North Suzhou Creek, had a dispute with Chuan Abing, a Wuxi native working as a waiter at the Dongsheng Restaurant at 18 North Shanxi Road, over not paying for a meal, leading to a grudge. At 1:45 PM on the 8th of this month, Chuan Abing was passing near North Suzhou Creek on business when he was brutally beaten by these people and stabbed in the back with a triangular bayonet, resulting in his death. After the incident, Hua Detective Shang Wu and Detective Shen Dehui from the Hui Si Police Station apprehended six people, including Zhang Xueheng, along with the murder weapon, and escorted them to the First Special District Court for interrogation.

<h3>Bandit Opens Fire to Resist Arrest; Offender Captured and Sent to Court</h3>
<p>Recently, due to the severe weather, common street robbers (commonly known as "pig skinners") specialize in robbing pedestrians of their belongings and stealing woolen coats on secluded roads for pawn shop use. There are countless such bandits. At 8:20 PM on the 22nd, West Constable Skyeam, No. 126, Third Section, and three Chinese Constables, Nos. 333, 335, and 401, from the Gordon Road Police Station, along with Female Detective No. 29, were inspecting pedestrians in the area of Hart Road and Changping Road. Heading west from Shandong, they saw three Jiangbei people, Chen Sifu, Xu Fuchun, and the fugitive Li Decai, who appeared suspicious. Heading west from the south, they appeared extremely flustered. The Chinese and Western constables ordered these people to stop, frisked them, and ordered them to raise their hands. Xu Bandit actually pulled out a pistol from his sleeve and opened fire to resist arrest, fleeing south towards Hart Road. The Chinese and Western constables gave chase, firing back. Both sides exchanged bullets like a string of pearls. As a result, Xu Bandit was shot in the chest and fell to the ground, and Chen Bandit was also captured. Li Bandit took the opportunity to escape. The Chinese and Western constables then took Chen Sifu and Xu Fuchun, along with a pistol, to the police station. Xu Bandit was seriously injured and sent to the police hospital for treatment. Yesterday, Chief Zhang sent Chen Bandit to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Qian Xun gave a detailed account of the case and requested an extension. Subsequently, the Chinese and Western constables testified about the situation of the injured Xu Bandit opening fire to resist arrest. Questioning the defendant Chen Sifu, he confessed that he, the injured Xu Fuchun, and the fugitive Li Decai had recently robbed pedestrians of their overcoats a total of 50 times in deserted places on various roads. Judge Huang Risheng ordered that he be remanded in custody and rescheduled for a hearing after Xu Fuchun recovers from his injuries.</p>
<h3>Rice Shop Old Clerk Commits Fraud to Obtain Money; Eight Offenders Detained Awaiting Sentencing</h3>
<p>Wu Xiaojin, an old clerk in charge of food at a food store in Yong'an Lane, Shui'an Street, French Concession, after his layoff, took advantage of his familiarity with the delivery situation of various food stores, and instigated Cheng Chang, Li Shengfu, Chuan Dequan, Chu Asan, etc., to raise funds to open a business at No. 168, Lane 66, Xin Zha Road, specializing in collecting sample rice and soybeans from various rice stores that old clerks had obtained from warehouses on Suzhou Road. At the same time, Wu Xiaojin also used sample rice bags stolen from Xinfeng and Rentai Association Food Stores, sending people to sell samples to warehouses every day. This matter was discovered by Hua Detective Neng Youwei of the Xin Zha Police Station, who then arrested Cheng Chang, Li Shengfu, Shen Are, Chuan Dequan, Zhang Shunbiao, Gao Yongkang, Chu Asan, Jiang Xiaoniu, and eight others. Yesterday, they were escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin prosecuted them for fraud.

<h3>Zhou Lin Defrauds Passport Fees; Interrogated and Sentenced to Four Months</h3>
<p>Zhou Lin, a local from Ningo, 22 years old, residing at No. 20, Avenue Rehm, since October of last year, falsely used the name of the National Government to recruit aspiring young people to go to Chongqing for work-study programs, defrauding male and female students of 15 yuan in national currency for passport fees. Zhou issued receipts forged with the signature of Chen Guofu, the chief committee member of the recruitment committee. At one time, dozens of people were deceived. After Zhou obtained the money, he indulged in singing and dancing halls every day. On the 5th of this month, Hu Zhiyun and Zhou Wenlong reported him to the French Police Station, who arrested him and escorted him to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special Court for interrogation.

<h3>Rogue Extortion Punished; Wu Zhonghua Sentenced to One and a Half Years in Prison</h3>
<p>Wu Zhonghua, from Nanjing, nicknamed "Little Xizi," is a well-known rogue. He usually relies on his power to bully people and extort money for a living. Various guide agencies, singer and prostitute houses, and dance halls within the jurisdiction of the Old Zhabei Police Station have suffered from his actions. On the 6th of last month, Wu demanded a protection fee of 20 yuan from Chen Guangming's Guangming Guide Agency at No. 996, Lane 10, Guangxi Road. Chen refused, and Wu left angrily. However, Chen was not weak and knew that Wu would retaliate, so he ambushed many thugs, each armed with iron rods and wooden sticks, to prevent the unexpected. After a while, Wu indeed led a crowd and came, and a conflict arose between the two sides. At that time, Wu was no match and left resentfully, but he was not satisfied, so he went to a certain vegetable shop in the French Concession and falsely reported to the Old Zhabei Police Station that a robbery had occurred at Guangming Agency. Upon receiving the report, the police station immediately dispatched a large number of armed Chinese and Western detectives to investigate and only found more than a dozen thugs, who were arrested and fined. On the 8th of this month, Wu again used his birthday as an excuse to open a room at the Continental Hotel, sending invitations to various guide and prostitute houses, ordering them to help send gifts. This matter was discovered by Fang Tewa, the Western police chief of the flower donation class of the Old Zhabei Police Station, and Detective Cui Chengke, who believed that Wu dared to openly extort money, so they went to the Continental Hotel and arrested Wu and his assistant Xu Linfu, along with 174 yuan and 50 cents in gifts, and escorted them to the First Special Court, where police lawyer Zhang Dayin requested detention for investigation. Yesterday morning, Judge Chuan Lin presided over the interrogation in the Second Criminal Court. The police prosecuted Wu for intimidation and extortion and false accusations, and representatives from various guide agencies such as Guangming, Yang Guifei, Tao Tao, and Black Cat testified that they had to give gifts because they feared Wu's evil power. Questioning Wu and others, their statements were evasive. Judge Chuan examined the statements and sentenced Wu Zhonghua, alias Little Xizi, to one year and six months of imprisonment, and Xu Linfu to 50 days of detention for assisting, with a two-year suspended sentence. The gift money was deposited in the treasury pending collection.</p>
<h3>Boat Rental Dispute; Deadline for Compensating the Boat Price</h3>
<p>Qu Songqing, the owner of Qu Changshun, an enterprise at the corner of Xiaodongmen Street, was sued because he had leased the Yongfu small steamship and added it to the Japanese "Shanghai Inland River Shipping Company" without permission. After the lease expired, he delayed in returning the ship. Therefore, the shipowner Han Funan commissioned lawyer Wu Peng to file a lawsuit with the Civil Court of the Second Special Court, suing Qu et al. for returning the ship and compensating for a loss of 11,200 yuan. After three trials, it was concluded that the defendant Qu Songqing should return one Yongfu steamship to Han Funan. If the ship cannot be returned, he should compensate for the boat price of 8,000 yuan. Judge Tian Shuru opened the court to enforce the case yesterday. The defendant Qu Songqing did not arrive and only sent a representative to the case and requested an extension. Subsequently, Wu Peng, the agent lawyer for the plaintiff, said that the defendant deliberately delayed and requested permission to seize his property. After examining the arguments in court, it was ordered that the defendant Qu Songqing must pay the boat price within seven days, and overdue permission will be granted to seize the property.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the esteemed editor of your newspaper:</p>
<p>I am writing in response to a news item in today's edition regarding a "monk who took poison after gambling losses." The monk, Dao Cheng, was ordained elsewhere and is not a disciple of our temple. He only arrived at our temple a month ago to request lodging. Because our temple is a public karma forest, we accepted him as a clean guest monk to assist with sutra chanting. We did not expect that he would use the excuse of asking for leave to go out gambling, which led to the poisoning incident. Our reception hall had no prior knowledge of this matter. After the incident occurred, we reported it to the police station and sent him to the hospital. At the same time, we immediately removed the monk's guest list and will never accept him again. The statement in your newspaper that the monk was in the temple six or seven years ago is based on rumors and is inaccurate. I am writing this letter to inform you and request that your newspaper publish this letter to clarify the matter. I would be extremely grateful.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>The Reception Hall of the Qingliang Temple Branch, Niuzhuang Road</p>

<h3>Finance; Foreign Exchange Bulls Resume Activity; Tensions Return to the British and American Exchange Markets</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: HSBC's listed prices showed no changes. The British and American exchange gray market reversed the silence of the past two weeks and entered a tense state again. The situation continued to shrink, and the return wind was particularly strong, even creating new tight prices this year. This is because reports stated that the Chinese government is determined to resist to the end, so the atmosphere of peace has completely disappeared. Moreover, rumors spread in the afternoon that the US-Japan trade agreement was unlikely to be renewed, so general speculators repeated their old tricks and seized the opportunity to act. Moreover, Western firm Sassoon continued to add weight, and Japanese yarn factories needed a large amount of funds for cotton settlement in March and April. On the other hand, although Chinese banks released some funds in the morning, they disappeared in the afternoon and even made a few follow-up purchases. The intention to supply by outside parties was weak, and supply and demand were naturally difficult to balance. Regarding the daily process, the morning opening was flat. Then, due to the benefit of a certain American bank having an appetite to buy, and Sassoon and speculators also actively participating in the spot market, the market suddenly tightened. By 10:00 AM, it had shrunk to 4 pence 75 and 7 yuan 8125. Because Chinese banks came to supply funds, the wind of buying was slightly suppressed, so the market image temporarily turned stable. The afternoon closing was 4 pence 765625 and 7 yuan 875. In the afternoon, the news was beneficial, and the buying wind revived. Furthermore, because sellers were hesitant to move forward, it tightened directly to 4 pence 6875 and 7 yuan 71875. Until the evening closing, the British gold remained at 4 pence 6875, and the US exchange rate was 7 yuan 75. The potential of futures was equal to that of spot goods.</p>
<p>Sassoon First Comes to Fiercely Buy</p>
<p>In the early morning, London's large bars were flat both near and far, New York's silver price remained flat, London's raw gold was fixed, and exchange rates for various currencies such as British against US, Shanghai, and France were flat. US against British was also flat, against Shanghai it decreased by 1 jiao, and against France it decreased by a little one or two five. The Central Bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. Banks' morning opening spot prices were 4 pence 8125 for British gold and 7 yuan 9375 for US exchange, with no rise or fall compared to the previous closing. After the opening, because a certain bank had the intention to buy, and Western firm Sassoon also fiercely bought, and then general speculators actively participated in futures, the market gradually tightened. It is estimated that the benefit absorbed 4 pence 8125 of British gold from colleagues this month, followed by Sassoon also purchasing spot British gold from outside parties at 4 pence 78125 and February US exchange at 7 yuan 8125 and 78125. The HSBC listed prices were announced to remain unchanged. The silver balance tax was also announced to have no rise or fall. Afterwards, speculators also settled in February US exchange with outside parties and Chinese banks at 7 yuan 75 and 71875. At this time, the spot price also softened to 4 pence 75 and 7 yuan 8125. Afterwards, the wind of buying gradually subsided, and Chinese banks continued to supply funds, so the situation returned to flat, reaching 4 pence 765625 and 7 yuan 875. Although Japanese yarn factories came to buy distant-month US exchange, Chinese banks still supplied funds, so there was no impact. Three-month US exchange was opened at 7 yuan 625, and four-month US exchange was opened at 7 yuan 4375. Extending to the afternoon closing, banks' spot selling prices were 4 pence 765625 for British gold and 7 yuan 875 for US exchange, British tightening by 046875 and US shrinking by 0625 compared to the morning opening.</p>
<p>Japanese Group Settles in Distant Months</p>
<p>The market continued to tighten because there was a lot of beneficial air in the afternoon, so those who bought were even more eager. It is estimated that importers bought spot US exchange from outside parties such as Datong and a certain bank at 7 yuan 8125 and 75. At the same time, speculators also purchased February US exchange from outside parties at 7 yuan 75 and 6875. Furthermore, a certain Chinese bank also settled February US exchange at 7 yuan 6875 and 625 with outside parties, and Japanese yarn factories bought March US exchange from outside parties at 7 yuan 5625 and half a yuan. At that time, the spot price also softened to 4 pence 6875 and 7 yuan 71875. The state of affairs gradually flattened, and until the evening closing, banks' spot selling prices were still 4 pence 6875 for British gold and 7 yuan 75 for US exchange. The next-month term for British gold was 4 pence 625, and for US exchange was 7 yuan 625. As a result, the spot term for British continued to tighten by 125 compared to the previous day, and the US softened by 1875 again.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Still Has Few Changes</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 23rd: The exchange market opened steadily this morning. British and US exchange rates showed no changes. Shanghai exchange spot rose by 1 yuan to 308 yuan.

<h3>Rampant Rumors, Gold Prices Soar</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spot gold dark market continued its rebound. The morning's rise was gradual, but unexpectedly in the afternoon, it surged past the 4,100 yuan mark, setting a new record for the year. This was mainly due to the exchange rate market continuing to tighten sharply, while negative news had dissipated. Conversely, the bulls held a dominant position, causing buyers to forge ahead without hesitation. Furthermore, the Hong Kong syndicate sporadically became active, resulting in a rise of 77 yuan more than the previous day. As for the day's situation, the opening exchange rate was tight, immediately jumping 24 yuan to 4,075 yuan. Later, due to the exchange rate weakening and a certain money exchange mutually taking in, it twice reached 4,090 yuan. Subsequently, securities firms took profits, causing it to briefly drop to 4,073 yuan. However, a certain money exchange then came to support it, so the midday close was still 4,082 yuan. In the afternoon, the exchange rate continued to tighten, news was positive, and buying became more enthusiastic. Furthermore, the Hong Kong syndicate aggressively bid up, at one point reaching a peak of 4,136 yuan. Although it subsequently retreated slightly, the final result was still 4,128 yuan, with a total transaction volume of approximately 2,000 taels. Gold jewelry increased by 10 yuan per tael, while customs gold remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Spot Gold Rises 77 Yuan</p>
<p>From the morning, the initial opening price per bar (ten taels) was due to the continued tightness of the exchange rate and heightened market sentiment. Various syndicates mutually raised prices to buy, initially with gold shops purchasing from jewelry shops at 4,075 yuan per ten taels, 24 yuan higher than the previous close. Shortly after, a certain money exchange, a certain gold shop, and securities firms came to snap up on behalf of clients, and although the exchange rate was still reported tight and weak, even though jewelry shops, gold shops, and retail investors were still willing to supply, most took the opportunity to raise prices, so it rose another 15 yuan. Securities firms took in 20 taels from gold shops, calling 4,090 yuan. Subsequently, because the exchange rate stopped loosening and turned flat, the appetite of buyers gradually diminished, and generally, many who had made floating profits sold out. In addition, gold shops were also strongly selling, and soon it fell back to 4,075 yuan. Unexpectedly, a certain money exchange then came to support it, and there were also brokers circulating in the market on behalf of retail investors buying in, and the price then rose again to 4,090 yuan. Then, a certain securities firm took advantage of the high price to exit, and at that time, the exchange rate was slightly flat, so it gradually fell by 17 yuan. A spot gold shop sold 20 taels to a money exchange for 4,073 yuan. Later, a certain money exchange, seeing the low price, bought it again, and it rose again. The money exchange took in 30 taels from securities firms, at 4,082 yuan, making the midday closing price. In the afternoon, the underlying trend was firm and strong. The opening price rose by 8 yuan, with gold shops taking in 10 taels from jewelry shops for 4,090 yuan. Soon, the exchange rate tightened, and rumors of positive news were rife, and securities firms, gold shops, etc. rushed to buy in, and the price then broke through the 4,100 yuan mark. A gold shop took in 30 taels from a money exchange for 4,115 yuan. Later, a money exchange took profits and exited, briefly retreating slightly, with a money exchange mutually doing 20 taels for 4,102 yuan. After this, a certain money exchange came to aggressively bid up on behalf of the Hong Kong syndicate. At the same time, another money exchange and securities firm also competed to buy, and the exchange rate was still reporting tightness, so it rose again by 34 yuan. A gold shop took in 10 taels from a securities firm for 4,136 yuan. After entering, gold shops and jewelry shops sold out, immediately suppressing it to 4,120 yuan. Finally, due to money exchanges and gold shops taking in again, the army raised it by 8 yuan, with gold shops taking in 20 taels from jewelry shops for 4,128 yuan, making the evening closing price. As a result, it continued to rise by 77 yuan. After the close, a certain gold shop bought in, rising again to 4,133 yuan, with a fluctuation of 63 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of the spot gold shop's own brand gold was several yuan higher than the spot gold, and the buying price was reduced by 20 yuan. The current benchmark gold was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there was little trading.</p>
<p>Gold Jewelry Listed Higher</p>
<p>The initial selling price of gold jewelry in silver shops was still 410 yuan per tael at the major firms. Then, at 10:20 AM, it was listed 5 yuan higher. At 3:50 PM in the afternoon, it was another 5 yuan higher. As a result, major firms changed to list 420 yuan. New firms had the same price as the above. The buying price was still reduced by about 15 yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currencies Surge, US Dollar Notes Reach 12 Yuan 8 Jiao 5 Fen</h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreign currencies surged in price due to rampant rumors. Demand for British and American gold pounds rebounded, and market prices rose sharply. Customers enthusiastically bought up gold notes, and market prices rose sharply. In the morning, British gold notes rose to 46 yuan 2 jiao 5 fen, and US dollar notes to 12 yuan 6 jiao 8 fen. In the afternoon, buying appetite was even stronger, and market prices were even higher. In the evening market, British gold notes rose to 47 yuan, and US dollar notes to 12 yuan 8 jiao 5 fen. Hong Kong notes rose because the supply of Hong Kong exchange rates became scarce. Demand for French Francs and Annam notes increased. Singapore, Dutch notes, etc. all tended to be firm and expensive. Canadian and Philippine notes followed US dollar notes, rising rapidly. Japanese gold notes rebounded firmly, with the evening market at 1 yuan 2 jiao 6 fen 5 li. Korean notes were 1 yuan 4 fen 5 li in the evening market. Yesterday's market prices saw British and American gold pounds rise by 1 yuan 5 jiao, British gold notes rose by 1 yuan, US dollar notes rose by 3 jiao 5 fen, Hong Kong notes rose by 6 fen, French Francs rose by 9 li, Singapore and Dutch notes both rose by 2 jiao, Annam notes rose by 3 fen, Rupees rose by 5 fen, Canadian notes rose by 2 jiao, Philippine notes rose by 1 jiao, and other currencies did not change.</p>
<h3>Securities: Bulls Focus on Category E, Exceeding Category C Prices, Ruirong Foreign Shares Set New Prices Again</h3>
<p>In the securities dark market yesterday, the market situation saw the bulls vigorously supporting prices in the morning, but suddenly turned around in the afternoon. On the one hand, the bulls focused on raising Category E, which was seen as being weak on its own. Then, news spread that Zhejiang was tense, and people's hearts suddenly weakened. The bulls sold out, and the situation could not be sustained. After the close, market prices were even lower. This attack halted the all-the-way rising trend. As long as interest payments are not a problem, there should not be too much turbulence. Yesterday morning, the initial opening saw people's hearts follow the weak image of the previous day, and opened at a low price. Then, the bulls at No. 20 absorbed Category E, and No. 35's taking in was also not weak. Although sellers such as Lianhe and Daqing sold out a lot, prices were still low and rebounded high. Runli, Jiukang, and Jiufeng bought in one after another. However, the selling pressure of No. 11 Dafeng and Tongkang also surged, so although Category E was higher than Category C prices, people's hearts could not be encouraged because of it. In the afternoon, news came that the situation in Zhejiang was tense. The bulls initially raised prices again, and Category E even saw 51 yuan again. However, many floating profits had sold out one after another, and the market atmosphere suddenly declined. Tongshun and No. 41 specialized in selling Category E. Lianhe, Tiansheng, Taifeng, Shengda, etc. sold out one after another, and various types gradually weakened. After the close, market prices were particularly weak. The one-day result slightly retreated by 1 jiao to 3 jiao 5 fen, with a total transaction volume of more than 700,000 yuan. A brief and clear table is listed below:</p>
<p>Stock transactions, 150 shares of Chinese Commercial Securities were traded, at 29 yuan. In addition, a small number of shares of the Great China Match Company were traded, with a price of 20 yuan and 5 jiao.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the stock market of the Public Association was quiet at the opening, and transactions were also scarce. Until nearly noon, the prices suddenly turned firm due to the tight exchange rate market. Rubber shares galloped quickly. At the close, the buying sentiment for low-priced shares was extremely strong. Among industrial shares, trust company shares were stable throughout the day, while Ruirong shares even reached a new high of 25 yuan, and were particularly the leader among the rising shares of the day.</p>
<p>London, 22nd - Today, the listed market prices of British merchant Far East company stocks saw mixed gains and losses. The Mercantile Bank rose by 5 shillings, to 8 pounds 12 shillings 6 pence. HSBC Bank UK Registered shares rose by 1 pound, to 86 pounds.叉 Hong Kong registered shares rose by 2 pounds, to 88 pounds. Gluck Lin Rubber shares alone fell by 7.5 pence, with a price of 21 shillings 10.5 pence. The rest are reported flat.</p>
<p>London, 22nd - Today, the listed market prices of Chinese foreign debt remained stable, with no changes in the upper and lower range of bonds.</p>
<h3>Food Restrictions and Flour Prices in Progress, Flour Did Not Continue to Rise Yesterday, Whole Ticket Transactions Are Still Rejected, Wheat Owners Are Even More Hoarding</h3>
<p>The flour market situation saw the rising trend slightly slow. Checking the No. 2 flour mill disk, it still stood at the original price of 10 yuan, and had not changed. The authorities, in view of the continuous soaring of flour prices, felt even more threatened by the livelihood of the common people, and it concerned local public order, so they decided to impose restrictions. It was heard that the factories were being notified that the selling price should not exceed 10 yuan. According to factory discussions, the authorities had previously notified the factories to limit the price to 9 yuan, but the result was still a huge increase of 1 yuan. Yesterday, the factories allowed supplies at the original price for retail sales in this street, but the restrictions were even stricter. All large-ticket transactions were rejected, and customer disks continued to be rejected, so the seriousness of the situation had not disappeared. Only the return cargo field disk, because it was heard that the authorities would implement sanctions, and the factories had repeatedly urged the delivery of previously issued warehouse receipts, limiting them to be cleared by the end of the year, so the market appeared slightly weak. The price of Chechuan brand warehouse receipts opened at 11 yuan 3 jiao 5 fen to 4 jiao, while Green Cannon still had a high disk of 11 yuan 7 jiao 5 fen, which proves that the market has not completely softened. On the 20th and 4th, 9,000 bags of flour were shipped to Xiamen.</p>
<p>The wheat market situation, after rising to a high price of 19 yuan 5 jiao the day before, can also be said to have reached its peak. This is because export syndicates, Chinese factories, and Japanese factories have all been taking in for several days, causing the market to rise step by step. It was heard that a selling disk of 20 yuan could be announced soon, and its rising trend was particularly alarming. At the opening of the market yesterday, the cargo owners were hoarding severely. Later, because the Public Works Bureau restricted flour prices and returned flour, the rising trend of the market slightly subsided, and people's hearts gradually calmed down, so the explicit disk still used the price of 19 yuan 5 jiao and 19 yuan to allocate factory goods, totaling 2-3,000 bags. There were also 3-4 cars of warehouse receipt cargo transactions. The market prospect is ultimately easy to rise and difficult to fall. On the 24th, 1,988 bags of wheat were shipped to Xiamen.</p>
<h3>Selling Manual Goods, Rice Market Gradually Weakening</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the weather was sunny, and the cargo hindered on the way of the Japonica rice arrived at the port one after another, but still had to be transferred out from the Hongkou District before arriving within the boundary, totaling 1-2,000 bags of QingSi and other thin rice, and 500 bags of Nanhong early and late rice. As the goods gradually arrived in large quantities, people's hearts showed weakness, so in the early market, generally there were peddlers with manual goods seeking to sell them quickly, but the customers were also cautious and dared not take in too much, and the return cargo was seen to be flooded, with supply exceeding demand, the market situation became more tired, and a falling trend suddenly arose. Dhou Hou Japonica was rare, and there were not many transactions, so there was no glory or disgrace. Other such as QingSi, the special thin rice only opened at 39 yuan 7 jiao 8 fen, and Nanhong early and late rice opened at 38 yuan 8 jiao, and was finally decided at 38 yuan 5 jiao, a decrease of 2-3 jiao compared to before. Lu Yangjian was seen to come out of the sample, Baiyuan's going price was also flat, showing a tired color. As for Saigon and other foreign rice, although the customers' willingness to sell was still firm due to tight exchange rates and tight monetary conditions, the sales market had slackened and there were few transactions. Until the close, although such as Chen Saigon and others still had a relatively solid foothold, they still remained at the original disk. The original root cargo No. 1 opened at 39 yuan 5 jiao to 39 yuan 3 jiao, and No. 2 opened at 38 yuan 4-5 jiao, while the return cargo No. 1 Saigon only opened at 39 yuan 3 jiao including commission, and No. 2 opened at 38 yuan 2 jiao to 38 yuan, Huowen rice was 37 yuan 8 jiao, finally decided at 37 yuan 5 jiao, a depreciation of about 2 jiao compared to before. Tokyo rice fell by 3-5 jiao, and Siamese rice as well as Hong Kong glutinous rice, were both small, a decrease of 1-3 jiao. It is estimated that the total number of transactions in the city was only 4-5,000 bags.</p>
<p>Although there was no rise or fall in the production price of foreign rice, the freight rate increased from 3 yuan 3 jiao to 5 yuan 5 jiao, a difference of 2 yuan 2 jiao, so the pricing of No. 1 and 2 was even more difficult to approach. Even the broken rice telegram also required more than 35 yuan, and new transactions were difficult to properly deliver. There were still sales of returned broken rice, and the price was called high by 2 yuan, and the final result was an increase of 1 yuan 8 jiao, with a total of 200 tons traded, all for 35 yuan. The current rice's digestion is very sluggish, and with the early thin rice retreating slightly, the market price cannot rise as much as the return broken rice.</p>
<p>Also, foreign rice is coming in a steady stream, and the arrival in Shanghai has been repeatedly reported in this newspaper. Yesterday, the Italian ship Fuxi Qiaoma (transliteration) brought in 23,238 bags from Saigon. It was imported at around 7:00 AM yesterday morning and docked at the Hongkou Huashun Wharf for unloading and loading onto the wharf. It was heard that the foreign rice was handled by the local Heyi and Dafu foreign firms, of which 9,115 bags had to be transferred to Shantou.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton, The Bulls Return to Buy, Yarn Market Advances</h3>
<p>The yarn market is still calm, because Hong Kong syndicates have a need for 21s, 23s, 32s, and 42s yarn, although there are no large transactions, sporadic purchases continue. Therefore, the market sentiment is taking a step to improve, so although the foreign cotton has a surprisingly strong falling trend, the market has not been affected much. At the same time, most of the people in this year's industry have made profits, and the huge pure profit can be said to be abundant in wealth. After the settlement, it is better to buy some goods than to store the silver in the bank. In this case, the market is not only not weak, but is calm.</p>
<p>Due to the sharp decline in the three major overseas world cotton markets, people's hearts were normal at the opening of the current yarn market, and the opening price of 20s Double Horse was 728 yuan, down 3 yuan. Unexpectedly, the prices were loose, and the bulls maintained their hold and still did not give up. The bulls, such as so-and-so, turned around to buy in. Subsequently, it was heard that the exchange rate was slightly reduced, and buying sentiment was strong, and the market price gradually advanced to 736 yuan. By the close, some bulls sold out, and it fell back by 3 yuan. The statistics of transactions in half a day show that 1,675 packages of 20s Double Horse rose by 2 yuan, Tiannv rose by 2 yuan, and Double Earth rose by 2 yuan. Yesterday, Yong'an Factory opened 200 packages of 10s Special Jincheng at a price of 590 yuan. Today, 1,100 pieces of yarn will be shipped to Xiamen. The amount of purchases by various syndicates is divided as follows:</p>
<p>Same Industry: 1,140</p>
<p>Hong Kong: 490</p>
<p>Mainland: 45</p>
<p>Total: 1,675</p>
<h3>World Cotton Market Declines Consistently, Local Cotton Still Able to Hold</h3>
<p>The local cotton transaction is still quiet, because the three major European and American cotton markets have declined consistently, and people's hearts are weak. However, the exchange rate has become tighter again, offsetting the balance. Factory demand is blocked, but Qingdao has made some purchases, and the source of Subei is 1,114 bales of Tonghua. The current cotton transaction situation is recorded on the left:</p>
<p>Another message: In the foreign cotton market price, the New York cotton market, immediately showed weakness at the opening of the market yesterday morning, first because of the decline from Liverpool, and then because of the sale in the market by Wall Street and overseas cotton merchants. Some limit orders were also closed, and as a result, the market situation fell sharply at the close, a decrease of more than 20 pounds compared to the previous day. It is predicted that Indian lotus will fall by more than three rupees. Egypt stopped trading, and Liverpool fell by more than twenty pence.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign cotton transaction in Shanghai turned silent again due to various rumors and tight exchange rates. There were no transactions between traders, and factories had no intention of buying. Japanese manufacturers have not been moving for a long time. The market situation yesterday was very heavy. The following is the market price of cotton yesterday at the exchange rate of 7 yuan, a 50% discount to the factory price:</p>
<h3>Sugar Market, Coarse White Transactions Increased, Up Another 5-6 Jiao</h3>
<p>Yesterday, coarse white increased due to increased imports, and the trend was upward again. The association divided the current stock of 24 coarse white into 57 yuan for the company's own pier, an increase of 5 jiao, 57 yuan 5 fen for newly arrived foreign piers, and 57 yuan for old goods, an increase of 6 jiao, with 700 bags traded. Transshipment cargo rose by half a yuan, with 300 bags traded at 46 yuan. Taikoo's refined white fluctuated little, B mark West Pier was 57 yuan 2 jiao to 5 jiao, East Pier was 57 yuan, and the rest of the CW marks, etc., were 56 bags for the East Pier, H mark refined red was 42 yuan for the West Pier, 41 yuan 5 jiao for the East Pier, and Dutch red was 44 yuan. Local cotton white rose by 5 jiao, Zhenji No. 1 was 57 yuan, No. 2 was 56 yuan 5 jiao, local rock sugar rose by 1 yuan, No. 1 was 68 yuan 5 jiao, No. 2 was 68 yuan, and Jingming rock sugar was 70 yuan.</p>
<h3>Dried Goods, Longan Meat Remains Tight</h3>
<p>There are a few newly arrived longan meat shipments, and it was heard that the company opened a few pieces, the special high large slices were 186 yuan, and the decided price was 160 yuan. According to information from the production area, the handling price is still rising, because the cargo base is becoming thinner by the day. It is expected that the spring market may be even tighter.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains, Yellow Bean Rising Wind Terrible</h3>
<p>The price of yellow beans is moving forward, and new peaks are emerging one after another. The rise is so amazing that it is no less than oil and rice. It is not surprising that tofu sells at the price of meat. Yesterday's market for various bean prices rose by 3-5 jiao. Although the current market transactions are mostly for actual sales, the hoarding by hoarders has contributed to a lot of the rising wind. A total of 500 bags of Dingjiazhou beans were traded yesterday, with a price of 21 yuan to 20 yuan 8 jiao, 300 bags of Qingdao beans, with a price of 23 yuan, 200 bags of Wuhu beans, with a price of 20 yuan 5 jiao, 3 cars of Nanjing beans, with a price of 19 yuan 5 jiao to 18 yuan 9 jiao, 100 bags of Anqing beans, with a price of 20 yuan, 1 car of Mingguang beans, with a price of 20 yuan, and 5-600 bags of Chongming Sha Huang, with a price of 20 yuan 6 jiao to 3 jiao, 20 bags of Pudong Zhang杜 beans, with a price of 22 yuan.</p>

<h3>Talking About the Brotherly Love with My Brothers, Serving Together for More Than Twenty Years</h3>
<p>— Buddha</p>
<p>I have four brothers. The eldest is named Zihe, who was adopted out at the age of seven and is now deceased. My brother Shizhu died at the age of thirteen. Yunhe is the second. I am only three years younger than Yunhe. Therefore, although we are called four brothers, only Yunhe and I have lived and worked together for more than sixty years.</p>
<p>My brother loves quiet, I love movement. My brother is gentle, I am rigid. My brother loves to read, I love to play. Therefore, my brother entered school at the age of seventeen, and I was selected for the Xiucai examination at the age of twenty-four. My brother loves to read, so he associates with scholars. I love to play, so I associate with street urchins. Since our ambitions are different and our influences are separate, the brotherly love in our youth was not very deep.</p>
<p>My brother read early and became self-reliant early, so he married at the age of eighteen. I read late and achieved success late, so I started a family at the age of twenty-four. After starting a family, we shared meals but did not divide the family. Our family was poor, so there was no family to divide. Some brothers break up over property, but my brothers never talked about financial matters. At that time, my brother was studying at Rongzhai Academy, and I went to Caoe to make a living. We were separated more often and gathered less often, so our love for each other was not very obvious.</p>
<p>申報 was originally founded by the American Zha Company, a foreign firm. In the late Guangxu years, the company did not intend to operate it, so Mr. Xijun Zipei took over. This was the beginning of 申報 changing from being run by foreigners to being run by Chinese. After Mr. Xi took over, he wanted to make major reforms, so he hired Mr. Jin Jianhua as the editor-in-chief, and invited my brother Yunhe, Mr. Lei Junyao, and Mr. Sun Yusheng to assist in the writing. I also joined in, writing only five or six editorials per month. This was the beginning of our joint work and the beginning of our career as reporters.</p>
<p>At that time, the theory of reform and law was very popular. I liked to travel, so I took the entrance exam to Nanjing Higher School after less than a year in the newspaper. My brother was soon transferred by the Xuexian to Jiangyin Nanjing Academy. The Nanjing Academy was where the Xuexian selected outstanding scholars from each county to study. Therefore, many outstanding talents from both sides of the Yangtze River gathered here. Later, they were sent to Peking Imperial University. At that time, the Manchu Qing government advocated reform. Counties established county schools, and prefectures established prefectural schools. Songjiang planned to establish a prefectural school, so the prefectural magistrate sent my brother to Japan to investigate the school system. After returning, he planned a lot for the Songjiang Prefectural Middle School, but did not hold any official position. In these years, we both studied separately and pursued our own careers, so it was difficult to get together.</p>
<p>In the 31st year of Guangxu, my brother and I joined the Southern Newspaper and served as editors and writers together. More than a year later, it was ordered to close down for publishing the matter of Prince Zhen marrying the famous actress Yang Cuixi, angering Prince Qing. Prince Qing was the father of Prince Zhen. At that time, he was a Grand Councilor and Minister in charge of foreign affairs, who was relied on by Empress Dowager Cixi. The newspaper was originally founded by Cai Naihuang, the Shanghai Taoist, and managed by Zhijun Zanxi, the brother of Concubine Zhen. Concubine Zhen was disliked by Empress Dowager Cixi, and was given death during the Empress's western tour, and was sunk in the well, so there is a Concubine Zhen well in the Forbidden City. Her brother Zanxi retreated to Shanghai and was a military outfitter for a foreign company, and also managed the Southern Newspaper, so the newspaper was basically a semi-official newspaper and had to be declared closed.</p>
<p>At that time, the editors of 申報 felt a lack of manpower, and Mr. Xi Zipei and Mr. Sun Dongwu firmly invited me to come. I was difficult to commit because Zhijun was still planning to restore the newspaper and asked me not to go elsewhere. Zipei urged me strongly, so I agreed to return to Songjiang for two months to rest, to see if Zhijun could restore the old business. During these two months, Mr. Xi urged me to come to the museum again, so I entered 申報 for the second time. Before half a year had passed, Mr. Sun Dongwu left for other matters, and Mr. Xi hired my brother Yunhe to preside over the writing. Since then, for more than thirty years, although the political situation has changed and the residence has changed, my brother has never left. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>My Opinion on Improving Ticket Sales and Greasing Palms</h3>
<p>— Huanjun</p>
<p>I used to live in Nanshi and never saw ticket sellers greasing palms on Huashang trams. It was also rare to go to the Concession, so my impression of ticket sellers greasing palms on Concession trams and buses was not deep. Since August 13th, I have lived in the Concession for more than two years, and I have been in contact with those ticket sellers almost every day. I feel that their behavior of greasing palms is very bad. I believe that this bad habit really needs to be reformed and cannot be allowed to continue. The author used to work for the Nanshi Huashang Tram Company and knows very well the reasons why the company's ticket sellers do not grease palms. I would like to contribute some opinions for the reference of people in the community.</p>
<p>(1) Better treatment: Huashang ticket sellers are indeed better treated than those in the two Concessions. In addition to higher wages, they also get four days of wage increases per month, and double wages on Sundays. At the end of the year, there is a bonus of more than one month. Because the company's business has a surplus (including the electrical part), there is an annual bonus of about three months. As for five-year savings, the company gives an additional 48 days of wages each year as employee savings, plus interest at a rate of one cent. The principal and interest are paid together at the end of the five-year period, so ticket sellers can get 20 months of wages for one year of work. Because the treatment is good, they are willing to seek permanent service and are unwilling to grease palms.</p>
<p>(2) Automatic prevention: The organization of ticket sellers is also a little more strict than the two Concessions, and the company authorities cannot act as arbitrarily as the British and French merchants. They will do their best to fight for anything that is related to their own interests. Since they often negotiate with the company, they are unwilling to give the company an excuse that is detrimental to their own progress. Therefore, the entire body automatically prevents greasing palms. If they find that there is any behavior of greasing palms, they will abandon them and force them to withdraw from the union so that they cannot enjoy the same benefits as other ticket sellers. This is also the main reason why ticket sellers do not grease palms.</p>
<p>(3) Shareholder supervision: The company is a joint-stock company with a maximum capital of 8 million yuan, so there are thousands of large and small shareholders. Most of them live in Nanshi, and many of them travel in and out by car. If they find that a ticket seller is greasing palms, the shareholder can copy the number of the ticket seller and report it to the company. The salary will be deducted lightly, and the job will be suspended heavily. This is also a secondary reason why ticket sellers do not grease palms.</p>
<p>Other things like short routes, few vehicles, and more ticket inspections are naturally also related.</p>
<h3>Rain After the Storm</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter Ten: Universal Language for Global Transportation, Education for Children, Awards for Talent</p>
<p>Nowadays, many Westerners are studying Eastern things. They also feel that Chinese geography and history are worth studying, and they won't make the same kind of jokes again. In the past, many scholars in Europe and America were arrogant and looked down on the Chinese, thinking that there were no real scholars in China. In literature, they only knew how to write eight-legged essays and poems, and they didn't understand any other sciences. Later, there were only a few students studying abroad who came to the West and picked up some superficial knowledge. But now they are also aware that China is not without scholars; there are scholars everywhere in China. Chinese scholars have always been buried, but now they have all come out. Moreover, Chinese scholars can make progress in studying any kind of knowledge. They are very clever in inventing a technology, and they are not weaker than scholars in Europe and America. Therefore, in recent years, European and American scholars have respected Chinese scholars very much, and the number of people who come to China to discuss learning with Chinese scholars has gradually increased. Moreover, China is a new and rising country, and there are many places that need to be developed. For this reason, all kinds of construction need talents, and the materials for scholars are even more abundant in China. For the sake of exchanging teachers and students, many European and American scholars come to China every year. Many of them want to learn Chinese and understand Chinese characters. For example, if they can speak Chinese, it will be much easier to travel in the interior of China. If they know Chinese characters, they can study China's inherent knowledge and read Chinese geography and history, and they won't make the joke of Confucius wearing a queue. These European and American scholars rarely have Jin Danyun as their guide when they come to China. Because after they come, they all go to various universities in China, or are entertained by cultural institutions, and they don't need a guide. Occasionally, there are a few scholars who only need him to guide them a little when they first come, and then they don't need him anymore. For this wedding, Jin Danyun only sent invitations to foreigners who were relatively close and lived in Shanghai, inviting them to have wedding wine. He didn't invite anyone else. Most of these foreign guests came with their wives. There were also many friends of Mrs. Su Liya, all of whom were Americans, but Jin Danyun probably knew all of Mrs. Su Liya's friends in China. Although Lin Jiancheng didn't have many foreign friends, he knew most of the British, French, and American architectural engineers in Shanghai. Therefore, today, the hall of the Grand Hotel is crowded with many Chinese and Western guests. They all came to watch the ceremony. In fact, the wedding ceremony now is extremely simple. They have already registered their marriage with the Marriage Bureau of the Municipal Government, and they don't need any marriage certificate. (231)</p>
<h3>Public Service Advertisement</h3>
<p>— Ren</p>
<p>When I was a child, the magic trick that amazed me the most was "getting rice from an empty cup," because an empty cup, covered lightly with a cloth, would turn into a cup full of white rice. The magician was still afraid that the audience wouldn't believe that the cup was full of rice, so he had an assistant hold a copper plate and pour all the rice down. I was really young at that time, how could I not be surprised that an empty cup could get white rice to fill my stomach?</p>
<p>But I grew older year by year, and my knowledge and experience also increased. So I knew that the magician was not a god, and the key to "getting rice from an empty cup" was that the cloth covered my eyes. The cup had a "false bottom," and the rice had already been hidden inside the "false bottom." After that, magic gradually became more elaborate, and these "little tricks" could only fool children.</p>
<p>But the facts are not always the case. A while ago, there were two rice shops in the newspaper using this magic trick. They filled the bottom layer of the sifter with cardboard. Although the rice buyers were not children, they were still "smuggled" past. Moreover, this magic trick is widely used. Not only can solid rice be "smuggled," but liquid fluids can also be used in reverse. For example, yesterday, the newspaper reported that two distilleries also used the principle of this magic trick, lining the oil ladle with lead sheets to "skim off the oil."</p>
<p>These four stores can use this "trick" in front of adults. Although they all use the key of the false bottom, their spirit of only being able to fool children is much greater than that of magicians. Therefore, I beg the editor to allow me to take up a little space to do a public service advertisement for these four stores in order to spread the word. The addresses of these four stores are:</p>
<p>Guanghua Rice Store, 39 Opposite the Small Vegetable Market, Caishi Road</p>
<p>Yongkang Rice Store, 241 Mintini Yin Road</p>
<p>Hengkang Sheng Distillery, Vegetable Market Road, Father Laoshin Road</p>
<p>Wanheshun Distillery, 65 Ximen Road</p>

<h3>A List of the Lineups of Various Theaters During the Old New Year</h3>
<p>— Sick Pigeon</p>
<p>Peking Opera News</p>
<p>As the Lunar New Year approaches, theaters are recruiting new talents, and competition is intensifying. Replacements are mostly in place. A summary is presented here for public knowledge.</p>
<p>Golden: Zhang Eyun and An Shuyuan will perform until the end of the season. The new actors for the Lunar New Year are Xiao Bo, Hou Yulan, Ru Fuhui, and Chen Shengtai. Gao Shenglin, Qiu Shengrong, and Wang Shaoting, etc. Lan Yuechun has decided to leave the company, and there is also talk of Xiao Linghong going north. Replacements are being invited. The rest of the actors remain the same.</p>
<p>Renewal: The new actors for the Lunar New Year have been confirmed. Kun Dan Li Yanxiu will arrive in port on the 29th. The rest, including male lead Guan Dayuan, martial male lead Liang Huichao, red male lead Li Hongchun, painted face Liu Yanting, female lead Gu Yulan, secondary male lead Song Yuchun, and martial clown Yin Jinzhen, will all continue. Yu Zhenfei is still in contact with me. Clown talent still needs to be added, undecided. Martial male lead Wang Guiwu, who performs at the Gong Stage, will be allowed to join Shixin.</p>
<p>Carlton: The Carlton's cast is known for being well-rounded. Since Wang Xichun left, the lineup has appeared weak. Now, Jin Suqin has returned from Yaodao. Through connections, she will join the Carlton. Negotiations are close and may be realized. The existing actors, such as Qilin Tong, Gao Baisui, Jin Suwen, Liu Wenkui, Yu Zongying, Zhang Huicong, Lu Lingyun, and Zhang Yueting, remain the same. To strengthen the lineup, they may hire one or two more female leads to continue performing "Wen Suchen."</p>
<p>Grand Stage: On the first day of Gengchen, they plan to stage "The Legend of the Sword-Wielding Gods and Monsters." In addition to the original actors, Li Zhonglin, Zhang Shuxian, Zhang Shulan, Liang Yiming, Chen Xiaomu, and Liu Kunrong, the Lin Troupe will join in cooperation. To strengthen the lineup, they have hired Yang Ruiting, a martial male lead who also sings old female roles, and Xue Youqin, a Kun Dan who stopped performing at the Tianchan Stage, and child actors Liu Jinbao and two other child actors. The talent is abundant and extremely popular.</p>
<p>Gong Stage: Since Zhao Ruquan joined the Gong Stage to perform "Ji Gong the Living Buddha," business has been booming and has not declined to this day. They plan to continue performing it in the New Year. The actors Zhao Ruquan, Mao Jianqiu, Li Xuefang, Wang Shaolou, Li Ruchun, Zhang Delu, Qian Lintong, and Zhao Dongsheng will all continue. Zhao Songqiao has been said to be transferring to the Tianchan Stage. If this happens, they plan to hire Tang Yunsheng or Bai Yukun to join. Wang Chunbai's condition is serious, and it will be difficult for him to perform on stage in the short term. They will look for a replacement. The play will still be "Ji Gong the Living Buddha."</p>
<p>Tianchan Stage: The Tianchan Stage is led by Chen Hefeng. The female leads are Han Suqiu and Yun Yanxia. In addition to Chen Hefeng, who works hard, there are also Yang Baotong and martial male lead Gao Xueqiao. If Zhao Songqiao returns, the lineup will be more complete. However, there is still a lack of martial male leads. They have invited Xu Jian'ao and Wang Yuanfang to join. The play will continue to be "Huang Tianba."</p>
<p>Imperial Palace: The Imperial Palace is a newly opened Peking Opera theater. The first cast has hired all the actors from the Kuide Society in Peiping. They plan to open on the first day of Gengchen.</p>
<p>Little Guanghan: Little Guanghan is the last remaining small theater. The old actors Jiang Muping, Xiao Hanchen, Liu Qinxin, Cao Huifang, and Zhou Biyun remain the same. There is talk of Kun Dan Zhou Meiyan joining.</p>
<h3>Refugee Cooperative Society: Banquet for the Entertainment Industry, Two-Day Grand Gathering Planned</h3>
<p>— Choucheng</p>
<p>The Shanghai Refugee Cooperative Society, in order to raise funds to establish factories to help refugees become self-sufficient, has scheduled a two-day grand gathering at the Gong Stage on the 21st of this month and the 1st of February, inviting famous Peking Opera actors, amateur Peking Opera performers, stars, and comedians from all over Shanghai. Last night, the president of the society, Chu Qiqing, the chairman of the board, Yuan Ludeng, and the director, Wu Zhaoyuan, hosted a banquet for celebrities from all walks of life at the Atlantic Restaurant to discuss the entertainment program. Over eighty people attended, including famous Peking Opera actors Qiu Jianfei and Chen Yuelou, amateur Peking Opera performers Sun Junqing and Jiang Bogong, stars Han Langan and Yin Xiucen, and comedians Liu Ziyun and Shi Chunxuan. Chen Peide and Jiang Yiqiu entertained them warmly. During the banquet, Yang Caoxian (101 years old) and Wu Zhaoyuan (83 years old) sat next to stars Chen Jingfang and Ning Xuan. Yang and Wu's hair and beard were silver, and they were full of energy. Chen and Ning were radiant and glowing. White hair and red faces complemented each other. Han Langan was as thin as a bone, and Yin Xiucen was as fat as Maitreya. Yang Caoxian's calligraphy is famous in the art world. Those who obtain it regard it as a treasure. Chen Yuelou, the chairman of the Peking Opera Actors Association, had long admired his name. He asked Jiang Yiqiu to introduce him and quickly said, "I am a junior who has long admired your name. It is my honor to meet you today. Please write a couplet for me, and my humble home will be filled with glory." Mr. Yang smiled and nodded, saying, "Writing is easy, like the output of a factory, not as difficult as your singing and acting. I will obey your order." Because a 101-year-old man is rare in the world, the other guests asked Chen and Jiang to introduce them to shake hands with Yang. They all said that meeting an old man on New Year's Day is a sign of longevity. As a result, it was decided that there would be Shanghai opera and comedy performances in the daytime on both days. The first night would be entirely amateur Peking Opera performers, and the second night would be a grand gathering of famous Peking Opera actors, amateur Peking Opera performers, and stars. The gathering ended in joy after 9 o'clock.</p>
<h3>Guan Dayuan's Family</h3>
<h3>Outside the Peking Opera Circle</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>Zhang Rongkui is old but vigorous (continued)</p>
<p>When he was paired with Xu Yintang as Zhao Yun in "Ganlu Temple," Zhang had not only received true teachings from famous teachers, but had also been influenced by many famous actors, so he can be called the number one in the North and South among the current martial male roles who wear armor and carry spears. Moreover, in other armored dramas, the actors have both fighting and chanting, as well as various postures, and there is no time to rest on the stage. If outsiders watch it, they will definitely think that it is extremely difficult and not easy to do. In fact, martial dramas are the most tense but the easiest to perform. Once they encounter a cold scene, they stand stiffly on the stage, with no place to put their hands and feet. Insiders are most afraid of encountering such a situation. In the play "Wu Zhaoguan," when the female lead sings a large section of Erhuang, the male lead stands upright on the side, facing the stage, for a full few minutes, unable to display anything or move at all. At most, he can only use one hand to comb the tassel of the spear, but that action can be completed in just three or two seconds. Apart from that, there is no other small action that is appropriate for the plot that can make him not stiff. He has to wait until the female lead finishes singing before he can turn his body. Therefore, this kind of place is the most sufficient to show the depth of the actor's skill. On that day, Rongkui performed this, not like others who stood like wooden chickens, and he concentrated from beginning to end, not showing any signs of weakness. Like a statue in an ancient temple, not only was he not stiff, but he was also full of heroism. People could observe his steady and well-trained posture in stillness. Every time we see amateur Peking Opera performers who have just started performing, we see them blowing their beards, staring their eyes, adjusting their crowns, and throwing their sleeves from time to time after coming on stage. There are too many problems, but it is still a little better than standing there stiffly. Others often say that Xiaolou's performance is civil singing in martial dramas, but how easy is this word? It cannot be achieved without decades of hard work. Now that Mr. Yang's grave is already covered with trees, if you want to see the old generation's model and someone who excels at wearing armor and carrying spears, there is no one other than Rongkui. Also, on the evening of that day, there was Zhang Rongkui's disciple, Ms. Zhang Wenjuan's "Battle of Taiping." This play was also taught by Rongkui. From the Golden Palace to the end with the arrow, the whole play is complete and without omissions. In recent years, it is rare for female actors who play male roles to be good at wearing armor and carrying spears. Although Wenjuan's performance is not particularly wonderful, it is still considered appropriate. If she continues to improve, it will not be difficult for her to compete with Xiaodong in the future.

<h3>"Wang Baochuan" Advanced Release Date</h3>
<p>"The two parts of 'Biyun Palace' are adapted from the famous play 'The Civet Cat for Crown Prince'. Yihua filmed it into a movie, and its business sense is definitely full. Sure enough, since its premiere in Shanghai, it has been sold out every day, and its appeal can be said to be great. I recently heard that Yihua will release 'Wang Baochuan' at Xinguang from 9:00 tomorrow night (25th). Because the contract stipulated that the film could only be shown for seven days at the 'Grand Shanghai', although many viewers missed it, there was no way to continue. Later, Xinguang posted a notice saying that it had received letters from viewers requesting an earlier release, so it was released in advance."</p>

<h3>Famous Actors' Calligraphy and Painting</h3>
<p>— Xiang Ling</p>
<p>Most actors use calligraphy and painting as a pastime in their spare time from studying drama. Those who are good at calligraphy include Yu Shuyan, who writes Su style; Wang Fengqing, who writes Zhao style; Yan Jupeng, who writes Mi style; Cheng Yanqiu, who writes clerical script; Jin Zhongren, who writes Dong Qichang style; Chen Jialin, who writes seal script and clerical script; Xi Xiaobo, who writes tiny regular script; and Shi Huibao, who writes Wei stele script. As for those who are good at painting, there are Wang Yaoqing, who paints birds; Mei Lanfang, who paints plum blossoms; Shang Xiaoyun and Jiang Miaoxiang, who paint flowers; Xun Huisheng and Jia Biyun, who paint landscapes; Xiao Cuihua, who paints pines; Li Wanchun, who paints chrysanthemums; and Zang Languang, who paints beautiful women. Shi Huibao is also known for his finger painting of bamboo and orchids, all of whom are rare talents.</p>
<p>As for the female actors Xin Yanqiu, who can paint bamboo and orchids; Tao Mocang, who can paint birds and animals; Liang Yunqiu, who can paint insects and fish; and Xue Yanqin, who can paint flowers, they are truly rare and valuable.</p>
