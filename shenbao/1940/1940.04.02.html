<p>社評</p>
<h3>日本外交攻勢的全敗</h3>
<p>野心是日不的，陰謀詭計是日本的，但前途如何？不用我，們推論日本現階段的策略是心勞日拙，至少有如一個日本兵向美國某記者所說一緲茫得很，很難得到成果」。</p>
<p>正直是中國的，時間與空間都是中國的，日本枉費心機，不惜工本的目欺，莫說供給了中國以更多更好的時間空間，至少日本決不能因時間空間而有所收穫。但看英國駐日大使克萊琪的演說，其辭吞吐，其意曖昧，尙未到公然阿諛日本現階段策略的程度，而立即在他的祖國，立即在太平洋彼岸的美國，引起了正直的憤懣和抨擊。再看日本現階段策略一朝具體化，立即引起了美國國務卿赫爾氏正直的宣言。赫爾氏坦然表白美國正直的態度，他說「美國依然保持其維護國際公法及現有條約之權，美國政府於十二年前與其他各國一致承認中華民國之國民政府，美國確信中國政府之首都在重慶，故美國政府始終承認國民政府為中國之唯一合法政府。」美國對華再貸款二千萬美金，無疑的是一個鉅數；是對中國的誠摯同情，實力援助；是對侵略國的無情棒喝，嚴重打擊；但是，前天赫爾氏宣言的確具無上價値，更非二千萬美金或任何鉅數所得與之比較。至於蘇聯，他的政府當局尙無直接表示，但在蘇聯政制下的報章論述，揭破一切，不留餘地；誰都不能吾定這是蘇聯政府態度的徵候。克萊琪大使的演說，原來不可遽視為英國的態度，當然更不能視為法國殆與有同感焉；試看昨天的倫敦巴黎電訉，英法兩國官方針對着遠東當前的雲翳，表示「整個政策仍無變更，仍認蔣委員長領導下之行政機關為中國唯一的國民政府」</p>
<p>擾亂遠東的是日本。至於安定遠東，中國應當多盡些義務，且已盡了極大義務，更在繼續作莫大的勞力之中；此外，美國，蘇聯，英法，皆是安定遠東的重要因素。現在日本纔開始具體化其現階段策略，而美蘇英法各國「不含糊」的如響斯應，有如上述，雖昨天的東京電訊，謂日本當局對於如此反應，稱為「原在意料中」；若非原始動物，以鎭靜抑制焦急，以冷淡掩飾狼狽，「原在竟料中」。因為分析日本現階段的策略，倘若依然自信這一次得以處理國內問題的方式來處理所謂「中國事變」，亦即不視中日戰爭為國際問題而視為無關國際，則自始不用現階段的策略了。所以日本這一策略的形態，似是對華的政治攻勢，而其本質則是對國際的外交攻勢。用了現階段策略而立即得到國際如此明朗正直的反應，猶謂「原在意料中」，而似乎容許不顧國際，容許澹然置之，則是顯見的欺人之談。分析日本的本意，他想偽裝了國際正常的合法的方式，於是而談判，而締約，而簽字，而「調印」，而批准，而交換文書，凡百官僚政治主義的手續，盡有盡備，然則一手「文書」，一手事實，擺什各國面前。分析日本的術數，或是日本當局用了官僚政治主義的眼鏡觀察各國吧？或是得了駐外官員錯誤的報告吧？或是買了他國間諜工作人員的假貨吧？他竟然誤信以為祗要「文書」齊全，事實宛在，各國便抹了嘴巴不響了，各國便裝了癡傻承認了。詎知各國不癡小傻，立即有叫朗而正直的反應！反應的決絕，如斬釘，如截鐵！這眞是出乎日本意料之外。若謂若此而日本當局不焦急，不狼狽，若非眞痴眞傻，即是裝痴裝傻。</p>
<p>就日本對華的整個策略言之；所有軍事攻勢、經濟攻勢，政治攻勢，是整個策略中的內綫作戰；縱橫捭闔於國際之間的外交攻勢，是整個策略中的紆迴作戰。內綫作戰的目的，在乎摧毀中國的本體，終於崩潰；紆迴作戰的目的，在乎隔絕中國的國際，終於窒息。內摧毀，外崩潰，他在最初是雙管齊下，以速中國的滅亡；在最近，他雖沒有停止其內綫作戰，但認定紆迴作戰而成功，亦足以制中國於死命，故竭了全力向這一方面鑽營。到了現在，日本的內綫戰略着着失敗，離最後的決定的，明顯的失敗，確已不遠；他的紆迴戰略則因這二三天的國際反應而確切證明其先內綫戰略而大失敗，，且完全失敗！</p>
<p>因此，我們診斷日本到了重要的轉捩點。</p>
<p>這一個工作、當然是艱難鉅大的工作、但是我們為增强抗戰力量、促進建國成功、必須以最大的決心和努力、迅速完成、我們要使人民獲得行使四權的實際訓練、要使人民有組織、兵役更健全、要使地方力量充實、國民敎育普及、都非推行此制不可、希望各位同人、一致盡力、共同策進、乙·關於經濟方面、特別注重經濟建設的發展、和財政金融力量的充實、對於經濟建設、是要使工礦生產有增加、也要使農業生產能擴充、在工業和礦業方面、除已按照旣定計劃積極進行以外、最近更制定進一步的擴充計劃、增撥資金、限期推進同時覺得抗戰資源與民生日用品的充足、根本上必須從發展農業入手、因此今後的設施、要盡力發展農業經濟充裕農村金融、增進農民生產、農林部的獨立設置、就是要使農林墾殖有專管的機關、此後必當本此方針、積極推進務期以國民經濟的充實减少我民衆在戰時不必要的負擔和痛苦、增進我勞苦人民一般的福利、至於財政金融方面、要特別提及的、就是四行聯合總處的成立、因為我們這兩年多來、財政基礎、日臻鞏固國家收支、也不感到短絀、一大半是得力於戰前財政金融政策的準備完善、與實施有效、現在我們要加緊經濟建設、就必須更進一步、集中金融機構的力量、來推行我們整個的經濟政策、四行聯合總處成立以來、對於金融網的推廣、設置外匯基礎的穩定、以及生產資金的吸收和貸放、都是盡力進行、回溯過去半年之中、四行的貢獻及其成績、已極高著、此後更當逐步推進、使我們經濟建設、因金融力量的增加、而更能加速的完成、以上是說明我們半年來軍事外交和政治設施的概要、我們再來看一看日人的情形、日本軍事力量的衰竭、我前面已經說過、不待再言、就是他國內政治經濟情形、也已到了崩潰在卽的地步、在經濟方面、牠今年的總預算、達一百六十萬萬圓、公債無法銷行、紙幣不斷濫發、農村勞力、日見缺乏、煤荒電荒、使工業無法維持、尺民生活、極度不安、社會基礎、到處搖動、火災迭起、損失重大、入禍天災不勝枚舉、而政治方面、軍人專橫、日甚一日、祗看這幾個月以來、阿部下台、米內登塲、接着齋藤開餘、以至牠七十五屆議會內種種經過、都可以見得他現在祗有幾個軍人在支配着一切、牠一心一意的想擾亂東亞、反而自稱（建立東亞新秩序）蓄意徘除各國在遠東的合法權益、反而自欺欺人的高唱「合作」一面瞧者歐戰的機會、妄想投機取巧、同時又自作聰明、想要玩弄列强各個擊破、如此存心誰不洞燭、我們姑且舉一兩個例來說、日本最初以反對蘇聯引誘歐美、但歐美諸國不受其欺、繼而想以接近蘇聯威脅歐美，又為蘇聯所鄙棄、而歐美諸國也並未為所脅制、現在牠又想用反蘇的偽裝、來緩和歐美諸國、這種愚拙的態度有不為列强所一致吐棄的麽、（待續）</p>

<p>查該項新領土共計三萬六千方公里之廣、因此關於該地之組織以及經濟文化發展等問題、殊有加以注意之必要、除一小部份外、該項新領土接連卡萊里亞自治蘇維埃社會主義共和邦、且在歷史及國民殺濟方面、亦與該共和邦類似、是以在討論蘇聯由芬蘭所接收之新領土之組織時、人民委員會對於卡萊里亞共和邦工人之合法而公平之意見、予以充分之考慮、該新領土除直接與列寗格勒相連之一小地帶外、應與樊堡、安特利亞、柯克森、索塔瓦拉、蘇烏查維、及高洛查維諸城、一同歸併於卡萊里亞自治蘇維埃社會主義共和邦名下、人民委員會向最高蘇維埃作　適當之提議、請予考慮、倘最高蘇維埃接受此建議、則人民委員會將提出另一建議、此項建議亦係卡萊里亞共和邦工人之意見、擬請將卡萊里亞自治蘇維埃社會主義共和邦改為卡萊羅芬蘭蘇維埃社會主義共和聯邦、</p>
<p>卡萊里亞自治蘇維埃社會主義共和邦已成為蘇維埃繫榮之地矣、該共和邦在全世界工人大衆之領袖斯達林及布爾什維克黨領導之下、逐步實現列寗斯達林之國策、卡萊里亞民衆、在蘇聯人民贊助之下、對於社會主義之建設、及國家文化之發展、已有重要之成就、吾人將新領土歸併卡萊里亞之後、已提高卡萊里亞之重要性、並在國家經濟及文化發展方面、畀以重要之新任務、人民委員會及卡萊里亞之工人、均深信此新組織之卡萊羅芬蘭共和聯邦、能完成此新任務、</p>
<p>蘇聯政府現已採取步驟將通達蘇聯之地方及卡萊里亞土峽原來區域連繋一氣、業已築成之彼得維柴夫特斯克—蘇喬維鐵路已將卡萊里亞之首都及茂曼斯克鐵路與蘇泰樊拉—樊堡綫接通、又甘德拉克沙—顧魯喬維一綫現正在趕築中、不久即可竣事、該綫所將卡萊里亞本部接連通達蘇聯之顧魯喬維一帶地方、</p>
<p>在併入卡萊里亞領土內之工業、除一部份外、均由卡萊里亞芬蘭蘇維埃社會主義共和邦處理、</p>
<p>此次卡萊里亞共和邦易為聯邦之一後、其名稱頗有加以討論之必要、查通至卡萊里亞之區域、並非完全屬於卡萊里亞、一部份係純粹芬蘭領土、芬蘭與卡萊里亞人民在種屬及血統方面、均有密切之關係、此次將卡萊里亞自治共和邦易為卡萊里亞芬蘭共和聯邦必可使該兩民族之經濟及文化獲得進一步之發展、而使彼等之友誼益為增强、同時彼等數年來之積仇亦因此而消弭、蘇聯人民委員會頃操權本人、起草關於卡萊里亞易名之法規、呈交最高蘇維埃審查、</p>
<p>此新共和聯邦行將參加蘇聯之其他共和聯邦、此事在蘇聯各聯邦之團結上、為一重大之新發展、在此帝國主義奴役民衆之時期、帝國主義之戰爭已使民族及殖民地之壓迫尖銳化、小國之權益已成為帝國主義者手中之零錢、吾人之新共和聯邦在此時期成立、足以强調蘇維埃制度保證小國充分發展之利益、</p>
<p>余深信卡萊里亞芬蘭共和聯邦不僅將成為蘇聯西北邊境和平及安全之障屛、且將成為共和聯邦中最進步之一員、（三十一日塔斯電）</p>
<h3>義報抨擊　蘇聯政策　指為乘機漁利</h3>
<p>羅馬　蘇聯外交人民委員長莫洛托夫、日前在蘇聯最高議會所發表之演說、頃由斯丹巴報加以評論、是為義國各報第一次反應、其言有云、「莫洛托夫之演說、雖極激烈、而內容依然模稜兩可、但觀於此項演詞、該國自去歲九月以還、所持態度、實已曝露無遣、查該國之意、厥在儘量利用歐戰、而在波蘭及波羅的海沿岸乘機漁利、並在保加利亞及土耳其兩國、設法取獲據點、質言之、即對於歐戰推行現實主義的機會主義的中立政策、靜待時局之發展、其侵略芬蘭國、即此項政策之一端、此際史丹林業已恢復其「中立地位、靜待交戰國雙方界以最好的機會、俾克實現其帝國主義者之野心、及帝俄之計劃、從而將鮑爾希維克主義、推行及於全歐洲及亞洲」、（三十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>羅京　蘇聯外交委員長莫洛托夫日昨在該國最高議會所發表之演說、頃由此間各報加以評論、時報載稱、「莫洛托夫演詞末段、聲明蘇聯旨在保證和平、安全保守中立、避不加入戰事、此項聲明、足使該國各鄰邦凡欲處身戰事之外者、為之滿意、此在羅馬尼亞國對於擁護和平保障各鄰國安全、向來未敢後人、但莫洛托夫所謂蘇聯與羅馬尼亞國、向無互不侵犯條約存在一層、殊屬錯誤、蓋巴黎非戰公約、旣因蘇聯之要求、而在羅蘇兩國之間、付諸實施、一九三三年七月三日在倫敦所簽訂之多邊協定、並非由蘇羅兩國單獨訂立、但亦切實規定互不侵犯之義務」、（三十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>蘇聯暫不任命　駐法大使</h3>
<p>日內瓦　法國政界消息靈通人士、自莫斯科方面接獲報吿、蘇聯於召回駐法大使蘇里資後、暫不任命新大使、據報紙載稱、巴黎蘇聯大使館、目前由法國秘密警察加以守衛、（一日海通電）</p>
<h3>莫洛托夫　演詞全文　（續昨）</h3>
<p>一九一九年四月十七日倫敦泰晤士報稱、「吾人如一觀地圖、當知自波羅的至列寗格拉、其最簡捷之途徑厥為芬蘭、良以芬蘭邊境距離列寗格拉祗有已十英里也、總之芬蘭為列寗格拉之鎖鑰、而列寗格拉則為莫斯科之鎖鑰、</p>
<p>苟吾人不信任英法帝國主義者此種計劃、則最近在芬蘭之事實、大可消除此種不信任之心理、該項計劃之失敗、非僅由於英法方面反蘇份子之缺乏熱力、及芬瑞挪最後理智之恢復、該項計劃之失敗、實係紅軍在卡萊里亞光榮戰蹟所以致之、蘇芬和約之基本意義何在、該項和約已保障列寗格及茂曼斯克之安全、此次吾人之希望、當與去秋略有不同、苟芬方接受吾人去秋之要求、戰事不致發生、吾人戰七旣已流血、目吾人深信芬政府仇視蘇聯態度過甚、故不得不以更鞏固之基礎、保障列寗格拉之安全、而提及茂曼斯克鐵路及茂曼斯克安全問題、良以茂曼斯克係吾人西部唯一不結冰之港口、在吾人對外貿易上極為重要也、吾人此次簽訂蘇芬和約、除保障列寗格拉及茂曼斯克鐵道安全外、並無其他目標、雖然、吾人認為必須根據永久辦法解決此項問題、蘇芬和約、完全承認芬蘭之獨立、並表示保障列寗格拉及蘇聯西北邊境安全之必要、吾人目的現已達到、對蘇芬和約極表滿意、蘇芬之經濟及政治關係、現已完全恢復常態、吾政府深信兩國之關係必可更進一步發展、惟吾人對於芬方若干方面企圖破壞和約之陰謀、不得不加以警吿、瑞芬典現擬成立所謂軍事同盟、挪威領袖漢勃魯竟建議芬蘭「恢復失地」、並謂蘇芬和約中不能持久、由是觀之、所謂瑞典芬同盟、無非係針對蘇聯、查此種問題、非特違反蘇芬和約第三條、並違反和約全部、蓋該和約已明白劃淸蘇芬邊界也、苟芬蘭係忠於和約、决不能參加此種同盟、至於瑞挪兩國、苟彼等亦參加該項同盟、則顯巳違反其中立、彼等此種新的外交政策、為蘇聯所不能瞭解者、吾人認為吾人殊無與瑞挪兩國發生糾紛之必要、蘇瑞挪關係應有正常之發展、</p>
<p>至於外傳蘇聯要求佔領斯十的那維亞西岸及那維克等等、全係反蘇宣傳、不値　笑、</p>
<p>所謂「社會主義」紳士如瑞典之漢格倫及挪威之脫萊米爾均企圖破壞蘇聯與瑞挪兩國之關係、彼等顯已被外國資本家所收買出賣本國之利益、</p>
<p>父蘇芬和約、並已解決蘇聯在波羅的海方面之安全問題、該和約補充蘇聯與愛拉立三國所簽訂之互助公約、據過去六個月中吾人所獲之經騐、此種公約已鞏固簽約國之國際地位、無論帝國主義反蘇宜傳如何劇烈、該三國之獨立並未受影響，反之、蘇聯與該三國之經濟關係則已大有進步、（未完）</p>
<h3>增強黑海對鎖問題　英法土無成議　英方否認提出建議</h3>
<p>倫敦　據倫敦負責方面宣稱、外傳土耳其已同意尤許協約國艦隊通過韃靼海峽以增强黑海封鎖之消息、實完全無稽、因蒙特婁條約之各簽字國家、已商定在土耳其保守中立之戰事中、任何國家皆不得派遣其軍艦通過該海峽、若土耳其亦亦為交戰國之一、則仍有權決定是否尤許他國軍艦之通過、倘使土耳其感覺其本身在立即威脅之下、自可作例外之決定、惟據路透社探悉、協約國方面並未回土耳其建議其目前已受直接之威脅、（一日路透社電）</p>
<p>倫敦　外傳英法爾國業已向土耳其國政府要求、准許各該國軍艦經過達達尼爾　峽、與博斯破魯斯海峽、駛入黑海、此訊頃由英國官塲方面、予以吾認、（一日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>日違反君子協定　擅增候選人名額　竟自二人增至五人之多　外僑對此陰謀極表驚異　公共租界前途殊堪隱憂</h3>
<p>關於工部局董事選舉、英美候選人業已產生、英方五人為凱自威·羅特立克麥唐納·海萊·密啟爾·鮑戚爾·美方為阿樂滿·卡納·華方五人、則有虞洽卿·奚玉書·袁履登·郭順·江一平·連任說、所可注意者、則為日方候選人遲遲不產生而策增加董　名額之舉、益為積極、以歷年中英美日四國所遵守之五五二二君子協定、日方擬於本屆打破之、甚且將領事上月二十八日之候選人選舉、展緩若干時日舉行、以完就一切準備、迨至昨日、候選人已產生、其額數達五名之多、則四月十七日之西人納稅年會之董事選舉、必有一番競爭、茲記其他各情如次、</p>
<p>日候選人昨日公佈</p>
<p>本屆工部局董事日僑候選人、已於昨日下午、由日僑選舉委員會主席林雄吉正式宜佈、稱、本屆日僑候選人共計五名、即（一）槁雄太郞、係本埠三井物產食社經埋）、（二）岡本乙一、（係日籍名律師、在村上律師事務所服務）、（三）岡本一策、（前西雅圖日領、近為在華日本紡織同業會董事）、（四）田誠、（華中鐵路公司副經理）、（五）黑田慶太郞、（上海紡織株式會社董事長）、</p>
<p>所持理由亦極勉强</p>
<p>據林雄吉氏稱、「日僑納稅人、在公共租界內者、已選三千之數、（日僑總數、據聞為七萬人）、而英僑納稅人僅二千八百、故日僑候選人由一人增至五人、乃為當然之舉、且日方之目的、乃在消除在滬某國籍之董事、對公共事業、以獨裁處之、公共租界由一切事業、應完全以公共管理之原則辦理之」云云、</p>
<p>英美僑民表示驚異</p>
<p>本埠納稅華人及英美僑民、昨日聞日僑候選人竟由二人增至五人、深表驚異、並一致斥日人此種舉動為「無恥」、某著名英僑對記者稱、「吾等以為日僑候選人或將增至四人、今五人之數、實出於意外」、至於日方何以將候選人人數驟增至五人、則據一般推測、日人乃在利用一種心理、圖僥倖一逞、蓋日人預料作此項要求、必遭各方之反對、但獲得少數之增加必可達成目的、以旣已宣佈五人、較以往增加三人則其他國籍納稅人在驚異之餘、不能不若干釀步、尤日方增加一二人也、觀察家昨對日人宣布此項消息時之「戲劇性」、均極注視、而認為非至最後關頭、切勿輕信日人此毬「無此前例」之消息、英僑選舉委員會方面昨對記者稱、該會將向投票處提出質問、其內慕究係如何、此等競選、實有莫大關係、雖目前英僑與日僑納稅人人數、或可相等、但英僑認為在資產上及權益上、英日兩方、當有極大差別、而英僑方面、自較日僑為多、</p>
<p>租界前途大可憂慮</p>
<p>美僑協會職員昨日宣稱、「美僑協會將盡力促使在滬美僑、參加此次競選之投票、彼等極希望其他國籍之納稅人、亦能採一致行動」、華人納稅會方面、則認為日人此種舉動、仍難在此項競選中獲取勝利、蓋日方所提出之五選舉人、在此次競選中將不致全權獲選可預言也、另一般外僑之意見、則以為如日人在此次競選中能獲得絕對的多數、則租界前途、不堪設想、所謂「公共租界」者、亦將變為「日租界」、彼等均對此事、極為憂慮、</p>
<p>日方計劃利用猶人</p>
<p>至於據一般之預測、則認為日人投票者約三千人、英人投票者的二千八百人、美人投票者的六百人、德人及其他各國投票者的六百人、華人投票者的八千人、然西人投票之數共四千人、日人僅三千人、在此次競選中、日人可獲得勝利之說、實難可信、即英人方面、昨日亦否認此說、認為英僑納稅人數並不致少於日人、至少可與日人相平衡、惟據另、報吿、日人將利用其他國籍人民投票擁護之、在蘇州河北區、已加緊進行、蓋日人現正欲利用一般猶太難民之勢力、為日僑候選人之擁護者也、惟另一問題、即為是否在虹口之日僑為全部向工部局繳付捐稅者、是否彼等之捐稅與蘇州河北區損稅之徵收方式完全相同、此項問題、實難予以一肯定答覆、此則日僑納稅人之資格、當屬一最緊要之問題也、</p>
<p>費利溥氏不作表示</p>
<p>又據工部局總裁費利溥氏表示、渠對日人此項宣布、不願有任伺意見發表、渠以為選舉程序、將照常舉行、日人此舉、決難改變以往原有之狀態云、又據西班牙駐滬總領事館方面消息、截至目前為止、西班牙旅滬僑民、由領事館召集者、業已三百之多、惟對彼等投票時將擁護何方、則求肯宣佈、</p>
<p>候選名單今午截止</p>
<p>工部局一九四〇年度董事候選、準本月十日十一日舉行、英美代表、均已選出、該選票須於今日中午十二時前、送交工部局總裁核收、逾時作廢、</p>
<h3>偽「中央市塲」開張　今日實行壟斷　偽方警告販商不得自行交易　鄉民不願受剝削多秘密販運</h3>
<p>偽「中央市塲」於昨晨十時正式開張、公共租界警務處當局、為防止意外、昨日特加派探捕在附近一帶設崗守衛、西藏路橋英軍、昨日亦突形增强戒備、偽「中央市塲」昨日因菜販均未領「出入證」、地貨商亦均未明瞭其交易方式、故未能營業、聞正式營業將於今日開始、滬西白利南路「分塲」昨雖開張、但亦未營業、南市「分塲」、開張日期、則杳渺難期、茲將所得詳情、分誌如下、</p>
<p>偽塲佈吿限制苛細</p>
<p>偽「市塲」成立後、對各地運滬地貨將加聚進行統制、然一般鄕民秘密販運者、仍所不免、日偽對若輩殊有無法可施之苦、乃於昨日在「市塲」門前貼出佈吿、警吿一般地貨販運商、須將運滬地貨盡行賣給該「塲」、不得「私自」交易、吾則將「嚴予懲處」云云、該佈吿並列出「不得私自交易」之地貨、為（一）時鮮部、（二）禽卵部、（三）醃臘部、（四）鹽乾部等、日偽把持之無微不至、於此可見、昨日運滬地貨被截扣之數量、尙不甚多、約計為二千飴件、據聞其原因，為恐驟將運滬地貨全部攔截、則一般運輸者將停止運滬、反弄巧成拙、故日偽決定採逐漸攔截辦法、並誘脅販運商、俟後將全部地貨賣於該「市塲」、而不再出售予其他行商、</p>
<p>南市分塲無法開張</p>
<p>日偽統制本市地貨機關、除北西藏路之「中央市塲」外、尙有南市及滬西白利南路兩「分塲」、以上二處、本定於昨日與「中央市塲」同時開張、然昨日僅有白利南路一處開張、而並未營業、南市「分塲」、則杳無信息、至其原因、據可靠方面探悉、為（一）南市各地貨行商拒絕參加、（二）法租界十六舖鐵鬥不尤開放所致、聞日偽方面以十六舖鐵門開放後、南市「分塲」始能成立、故正竭力請求法租界當局開放鐵門、然其能吾如願、尙屬疑問、</p>
<p>加派英軍增强防衛</p>
<p>偽「中央市塲」於昨日上午十時開放、公共租界警務處當局為預防發生意外、昨晨特加派中西探捕四名、在「市塲」門前設崗守衛、並有警犬一只、以資防範、至門前崗亭、英軍一名、照常擎槍元立、但在西藏路橋堍之英軍堡壘前、除一持槍英軍不時巡邏外、堡壘內部、且已新增英軍十餘名、以加强守衛、至交界處鐵絲網之各路口、則華捕英軍守崗如昔未有增加、「市塲」內部、昨日日偽便衣特務員密佈、戒備頗為嚴密</p>
<p>種種剝削菜販痛恨</p>
<p>該「市塲」雖於昨晨十時開張、然因各地貨小販商人大半仍未明瞭其統制「營業」之方式、故昨日並未「營業」、僅貼出佈吿、囑菜販前去購領「出入許可證」、並將參加該「市塲」之手續、告知一般地貨商人、昨日一般菜販、因該「市塲」統制全滬地貨、被逼前去購領「出入許可證」者、有數百人、該「許可證」有效期限、自昨日起至明年三月三十一日、為期一年、過期須另行購置、一般菜販、均屬貧苦階級、對日偽之剝削入微、莫不痛恨、昨日竟有向該「塲」管理員痛駡者、至該「市塲」營業日期、則已定於今日開始、</p>
<p>長江外艦往來</p>
<p>日本旗艦出雲號、自三月二十六日離滬後、即與其他日本軍艦同泊於南京以北之港內、據探悉、將於最近駛離南京、而來上海、美揚子江巡邏艦「蚱蜢」號、已於昨日啟椗赴蕪、按「蚱蜢號」係自上月中旬離蕪來滬、</p>
<h3>加蓋「新政權」郵戳　淪陷區竟照辦　惟租界郵件則已加拒絕　外界對乍配林舉措不滿</h3>
<p>上海郵政管理局長乍配林·遽尤所謂南京「新政權」、郵件上加董「國府還都紀念」郵戳、此事極引起外間重視、大通社記者茲探錄各悄如次、</p>
<p>遽爾照蓋</p>
<p>據大通社記者探悉、上海郵政管理局於上月三十日起、　尤所謂南京「新政權」在自上海寄淪陷區域郵上、加蓋「中華民國國民政府選都紀念」圓形橡皮「郵戳」、是項「蓋戳」、約有以前一圓銀幣大小、中繪總理圍陵門景、下鐫上海兩字、並附有活動之阿拉伯字日期、</p>
<p>脅迫經過</p>
<p>上項「郵戳」尙係於上月二十五日、由日本興亞院日員陪同所謂一郵政司者、造訪上海郵務長乍配林時、提出兩項要求、計二於三月三十日縣掛「旗幟」、二、加蓋「郵戳」、惟乍氏當以懸「旗」事件、前年南京另一組織出現時、亦有同樣要求、惟郵局自有郵旗可懸、即斷然予以拒絕、</p>
<p>租界拒絕</p>
<p>惟於加蓋所謂「還都紀念郵戳「一點、乍氏卒不克堅持、遽尤在寄淪陷區域郵件上加蓋、故上項「郵戳」、上月卅日起、除兩租界各郵局拒不照辦外、管理局曁滬郊如虹口·南京·等郵局、竟悄然照辦矣、</p>
<p>郵務困難</p>
<p>大通社記者昨晨訪謁郵政管理局某高級職員、渠對上海郵務當局遽爾接受上項要求、亦寄其慨嘆、第謂乍氏之出此、或為出於維護整個郵　之苦心，故於小節、不惜委曲求全、但在有識者之見地、此類辦護、　筧為一種飾詞也、</p>
<p>南市繼續開放</p>
<p>日方為欲繁榮「復興」其佔領區域、故於三月初、先將虹口閘北楊樹浦等處之通行證制度取銷、上月二十五日、又將南市區通行證試行取銷、期定一週、至上月三十一日滿期日軍方面、因開放之一星期間、界內未有任何變故、認為「成績」良好、故經駐南市之日海陸軍會商決定、於昨日起、繼續開放、惟認為可疑之市民、仍由偽警及「女檢查員」施檢查、其目的無非欲誘致華人歸返、藉以發展南市之工商業、以達其「繁榮」「復興」之迷夢、惟據大光社記署向各鐵門口之法警務處探捕探詢、法當局於鐵門開放後、每日對進出市民、加以統計雖日方取銷通行證後、進出者較前繁忙（約增加三分之二）、惟來租界者、仍多於進南市者、約計為四與三比、故日方之企圖、顯已粉碎、</p>
<h3>法租界應設置　標準電鐘　大自鳴鐘拆除後　市民多感覺不便</h3>
<p>近有若干市民、曾向法租界行政當局建議、請在霞飛路擇定三處地點、設置電鐘、藉以便利行人、知有標準時間、蓋在法國各大城市、均有此路上時鐘之設置也、據悉法租界當局正在考慮中、按在上海租界、現僅有江海關之大鐘、足供為公衆標準計時之用、但路人若欲知正確之時間者、則勢必須至外灘、方可知之、不便孰甚、查在以前、法公董局設在公館馬路時間（即現在之中匯銀行及麥蘭捕房附近處）、原有屋頂大鐘一座（即所稱大自鳴鐘）、足供指示路人以正確之時間、前後歷七十年之久、近則此鐘已隨法公董局之遷址而拆除、令人不勝惋惜、</p>
<h3>工部局西員吿退　退職金極可觀　連養老金在內預算大增　本年規定五百八十餘萬　局方職員不滿待遇而求去者極多</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報云、工部局養老金與退職金預算大增、一部份乃因警務處多人辭職及工務處裁員所致、工務處被裁者共九人、已於上月三十日完畢工作、查去年度預算規定養老金與退職金一·六〇四·九三·元、惟確實所耗、較預算的增什五、本年度預算所規定者為五·八一〇·一四〇元、較去年增四·二〇五·二一〇元、數月以來、工部局職員因不滿待遇、及薪金低微而辭職者、不乏其人、工部局對之、均須付給退職金與旋費、總數頗為可觀、</p>

<h3>奇文共賞</h3>
<p>去年杭羣童試正塲，次題爲而齊有其地矣雞鳴。昨遇杭友，言有一童卷，其次篇之後比，讀竟爲之昨舌！其文云：「浸假而爲黃之雞，與沒假而爲白之雞，與浸假而爲或黃或白之雞與；然雞之色不一，而其鳴則一也。夫鄰雞日攘，是齊人之恒事矣，而茲之雞鳴，其果爲鄰家所攘之雞乎？抑爲其家自畜之雞乎？」閱之以爲眞可當「奇想天開」四字矣。而不料其對比尤有出奇者。文云：「姑勿論其爲雌之雞與，亦勿論其爲雄之雞與，且勿論其爲不睡不雄之雞與；然雞之不同，而其鳴則一也。夫雞鳴可　，是齊客之多能矣，而茲之雞鳴，其或爲齊人斅之而嗚乎？抑或爲羣難各目爲鳴乎？一想入非非，猶覺得未曾有。或謂二比，文從字順，挽上截下，色色周到，殆文人之遊戲也。</p>
<p>狗葬村</p>
<p>人之忠奷，後世自有定評。當岳武穆被秦檜誣陷，身繫囹　，受盡荼毒，奸賊之勢，何其盛也。及至日後，岳王墳上，憑弔者摩肩接踵，西子湖邊，因此生色不少，秦槍則萬世唾駡矣。杭省武林門外，去城數十里，有一村，相傳爲秦賊之幽宅，後人痛惡之，名其村名狗葬村。</p>

<h3>金融　美滙還價　一度曾進六元關　不久稍稍回平　滙豐維持英金</h3>
<p>外滙昨日市况、滙豐掛牌、俱無上落、英美滙暗市、因週一與月初關係、悄况較為緊張、趨勢復俏、期貨尤甚、有回復上週初之模樣、晨開即因美英滙兌報長、致英金縮〇一五六二五、為四辦士一二五、美滙則平、為六元〇六二五、不久來扒者投機商居先、香港帮繼後、而日洋行活動力量更形顯著、一時買過於賣、市象已見軟化、英金未變、美滙為六元、且期貨價格緊風最勁、迨至收盤時、因需要稍緩、遂略回鬆、美滙六元〇三一二五、午後初尙平穩、未幾扒戶再起、美滙向結、一度曾减過五元九六八七五、（破上月二十七日六元緊價）、但為時甚暫、幸滙豐竭力供給先令、全日約十萬鎊左右、故迄晚收四辦士一二五之英金價、始終無更、美滙重吿六元、結果較隔昨軋緊〇一五六二五與〇六二五、期貨潛勢、與現貨均見拔開、</p>
<p>港幫首結日商繼後</p>
<p>晨初以海外滙兌英對美滬法等俱平、美對英長〇六二五、對法大一二五、對滬小五分、中央掛牌各滙如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金四辦士一二五、美滙六元〇六二五、較之上週末、英緊〇一五六二五、美則無榮辱、乃滙兌略長所致、開後外行有利等頗有賣　、而斯時扒者寥落、故市勢靜中微硬、計外行吐予投機商本月份美滙五元九三七五、同時現貨美滙亦喊六元〇九三七五、滙豐掛牌揭曉勿動、白銀平衡稅揭曉亦無升降、此後某銀行略有吃胃、頓告回平、迨十時在刻、港電忽來扒進、投機商跟風搜入、加之日洋行亦起活動、故市象驟吿緊軟、計港電扒進現貨美滙六元〇三一二五、及五月份美滙五元七五、並投機商結進四月份美滙五元九〇六二五及八七五、五月份美滙五元七五與六八七五、後華商再扒進現貨美滙六元、斯時現貨英金尙定、仍堅站四辦士一二五、期貨則稍跟縮、四月份僅四辦士〇三一二五、五月份祇三辦士九三七五、午刻扒者漸少、現貨美滙略形回硬、迄至午收、為六元〇三一二五、英金仍計四辦士一二五、比晨開英平美緊〇三一二五、</p>
<p>期現趨勢均見拔開</p>
<p>後市初開尙穩、仍為四辦士一二五、及六元〇三一二五、少頃因投機商續來扒進、市面又趨軟化、計扒進華僑四月份英金四辦士〇一五六二五、又吸進大通及同業等現貨美滙六元、後再購入某行四月份美滙五元八一二五、斯時現貨美滙竟喊緊至五元九六八七五、四月份英金亦叫軟至四辮士、入後扒者稍缺、為狀漸穩、延至收盤美滙回硬逹六元、英金仍為四辦士一二五、四月份英金四辦士〇一五六二五、美滙五元八四三七五、五月份英金三辦士九二一八七五、美滙五元六五六二五、結果比上週末現貨英緊〇一五六二五、美軟〇六二五、四月份英軟〇三一二五、美貴〇六二五、五月份英縮〇四六八七五、美緊〇九三七五、</p>
<h3>買戶如瘋如狂　黃金漲風竟不可遏　逼近五千六百元</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、雖晨初疲弱、但入後反見騰漲、勢由漸而烈、再創金價歷史新紀錄、乃因匯市潛勢吿緊、而人心均以購金為惟一牟利主義、雖市上籌碼時有溢出、但無不立刻即被吸收、至當時最低價曾見五千三百八十元、嗣後銀號帮及現金號買入、證劵帮錢兌業郤互有吐塞、故盤旋於五千四百元內外甚久，迨十時三刻過後、即外匯報縮證劵帮及日「某銀行」暗中力購、錢兌業等猛吸不已、價遂挺昂難阻、且午後漲風奇劇、竟躍達五千五百九十元空前高價、（破上月二十七日五千四百五十元高峯、）惟嗣因外匯回硬、買氣漸散、稍見微挫、收盤結果、仍為五千五百五十五元、較上週末午收、在升一百四十五元、全天交易由淸而旺、約四千數百兩、銀樓飾余步高十五元、亦創五百六十元之驚人紀錄、海關金等仍平、</p>
<p>全日飛漲百餘元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）初開外滙報平人心轉疲、賣者四集、一開竟跌三十元、銀樓帮出現金號十兩、為五千三百八十元、嗣有銀號乘機力扒、且現金號及少數　戶、亦五相搜入、雖證劵帮及錢兌業吐出、但仍感不敷分配、故遂步高三十七元、銀號進證劵帮三十兩、為五千四百十七元、此後外滙穩中微硬、加之證券帮等續來拋塞、而銀號獲利復吐、復又步小三十五元、金號出錢兌業五十兩、為五千三百八十二元、旋乃某證劵帮忽反出為進、而外滙已報轉軟、市勢步堅、迨十一時光景、又出五千四百元關口、後再加外匯續報緊、人心尤振、銀號錢兌業及證券帮等爭先猛吸、且散戶拋空者見景抵補、頓又哄起數十元、金號進銀號三十兩、為五千四百六十五元、午刻美匯稍平、銀號及散多趁高了結、遂回小二十元、銀號互做二十兩、為五千四百四十五元、作午收價、午後潛勢尤挺、一開即跳起五十五元、金號進銀號二十兩、為五千五百元、後滙市仍報走緊、且某錢兌業與某證券帮爭前力扒、不久再躍高九十元、證券幫進錢兌業三十兩、為五千五百九十元、惟某錢兌業忽來復出、而散戶多頭亦有脫手、遂回落五十五元、金號出錢兌業廿兩、為五千五百九十元、顧以某錢兌業復來搜入、而金號亦買、重又在抬五十元、金號進銀號四十兩為五千五百八十五元、入後證劵帮乘高復吐、同時銀號代浮多出籠、途回小三十元、金號出銀號二十兩、為五千五百五十五元、作晚收價、結果比上週穴午收、軋漲一百四十五元、全天二百十元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤較高數元、收進减低二十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十餘元、均無做開、</p>
<p>飾金五百六十元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金、每兩兌出、初時大同行仍懸五百四十五元、迨至十一時二十分、掛大五元、下午二時十分、掛高五元、二時十五分再掛大五元、結果共高十五元、計大同行改懸五百六十元、新同行與上價相同、以上均創有市以來之空前高價、收進减低十五元光景、</p>
<h3>外幣頻漲</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市况、英美金鎊仍不乏需者、市價繼續挺進、蓋黑市黃金又現新高價、英金票供求尙衡、惟潛勢仍堅、美金票猶動盪不定、初曾降至十六元三角、入後步趨堅挺、午後美匯突破六元關、故曾昂達十六元六角二分、比上次最高價尤昂二分、此後則因獲利者傾吐、晚市稍挫至十六元五角二分、香港票隨港滬匯兌趨堅、法郞票需要尙不弱、新加坡·荷蘭·坎拿大·斐律濱·等票需要俱殷、日金票回漲仍勁、晚市為一元二角九分四釐、朝鮮票需要愈殷、晚市為一元零二分、昨日市價、以英美金鎊各漲三元為最巨、次推荷蘭票之升二角、英金票·及美金票·新加坡·坎拿大·斐律濱·等票均漲一角、香港票升一分、法郎票高二釐、餘俱不動</p>
<h3>貼現步步高升　結果又漲二元　拆息亦升一分</h3>
<p>昨滙劃票據貼現率、先高後回、每千元上午一度飛上至六十九元、但不久回下至午刻為六十七元、下午又退至六十六元、比上週六尙續高二元、錢業公會拆息升起一分、早午兩市均掛一角九分云、</p>
<h3>證券　內債本身　自有其眞價值　豈因空言而異</h3>
<p>證劵暗盤、昨日市况復又趨漲、人心因籌碼枯竭而興奮、更以環境上頗為平穩、謠傳消息有利各債、其實內債本身豈因此空言而有所增减、不料價又上騰、雖在外匯新低價金子新高便潮流中、市價與向日之比例已不同、似已脫離從前金市漲公債跌之慣例、市上不乏多頭家、因祗需壟斷一種、餘必隨之而高、趨勢恐非普通眼光所可逆料、昨日交易、上午散戶交易為多、惟係進多出少、行市略見堅强、至午後二十號繼續搜購戊種、恒康亦收買戊種不少、一時籌碼頓感缺乏、乃復穿出九元關、餘亦一致帶好、結果回好一角至三角、成交約八十萬元左右、久未做開之九六亦有二萬成交、茲列簡明表於後、九六係比一月十六日行市、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交中國銀行股五十股、價為七十一元五角、</p>
<p>衆業股市、因銀根甚緊、賣方出籠較多、有數種股票、一度甚能抗拒是種壓力、如會德豐·中國墾植·國際·及上海銀公司等為其尤著者，但近收市、亦吿不支、收盤價為一日中之最低者、橡皮股不顧匯市之緊及多家橡皮公司之將宜布其股息、亦受同等影響而吿下墜、</p>
<h3>紗花　港幫採辦現紗　雙馬又漲卅五元</h3>
<p>紗市續升、且漲風在暴，此因南方需要起色、港帮採辦接踵而來、於是人心熱烈異常、市盤直上雲霄矣、此種漲風、未免太在、將後之反動、亦不可不防、不過現銷良好也、</p>
<p>現紗晨開聞外匯稍長、金價平平、人心尙和緩、二十支雙馬紗四月份開價為一千〇七十元、微跌至一千零六十五元、後聞粤帮對於現貨交易踴躍而來、市盤乃步步上升、人心更挺、買者紛至沓來、二十支雙馬四月直漲至一千〇九十四元、查半日間成交統計三千七百包、行情二十支雙馬現貨漲三十五元、又查棉紗出口、今有二百十二件、運往溫州、又七十五件運往香港、茲將各帮口買去之額量分列如左、</p>
<p>香港一、六五〇　內地　二五</p>
<p>同行一、八〇〇統計三、七〇〇</p>
<p>本棉交易仍屬平庸、惟外棉成交尙稱不惡、然行情異常平凡、此因印棉市價甚弱、各號購訂甚夥、近來印美棉花源源而來、所以本棉被其壓殺矣、紗價雖步步飛驚、棉市反見消沉也、茲將現棉情形如左、</p>
<p>通打包　二一二·〇〇　同行進一〇七件</p>
<p>又　二一四·〇〇　又　一〇五件</p>
<p>奧姆拉　二一二·〇〇　又　二〇五件</p>

<p>通州花　二〇七·〇〇　同行進二〇〇包</p>
<p>通打包　二一三·五〇　又　一〇〇包</p>
<p>另訊、外棉市價、紐約棉市、昨晨開盤因投機者購買而漲、後又因同業之購買及一部份之空頭抵補、結果收盤價格較之上日漲五六磅音、印度昨日連同預測降落五羅比餘、埃及漲三五磅音、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、昨日因廣帮棉紗春銷開始、市上現紗交易活躍、原棉交易亦被引起小額交易、市上同業手中之印棉現貨、竟被搜購一空、各方心意、對於原棉售價、又屬高翔也、茲將棉市以美滙六元折合送廠價如下、</p>
<p>二十支　美米特林　二八九·六〇</p>
<p>二十支　又　下級二七八·九〇</p>

<h3>油市　生豆油呆銷　開價俱跌四五元</h3>
<p>生油　昨實銷不勁而市上底積豐厚、市價逐見修削、比上月之最高峯已跌去十二三元、昨晨初之趨勢、尙見小修、午後由一部份多頭亟謀塞出、致變動較鉅、行情一再暴跌、結果花生油驟跌五元外、成交膠州生油二百件、價為七十元、烟台聽生油三千聽、價為九十一元、靑島桶生油六十桶、價為一百元、查其來源、昨由烟台來六千一百二十五聽、今日則有三千六百九十聽、運往香港、</p>

<h3>糧食　所謂米糧產銷合作　日商與糧商合辦大昌公司　共同來把持米麥雜糧銷路　洋米又上漲來源依然暢旺　存米眞不少流通僅占二五</h3>
<p>米市轉呈上風後、昨則人心尤佳、晨市初開即羣起搜羅、其中內地幫納意最濃、而本鄉店胃亦屬不遜、且浮囤散戶均見反出還進、競相爭取、致一般客販扳俏異常、喊聲迭起二霎已升一元、若一號西貢開出四十五元半、其後銷塲愈旺、市價一路直上、竟又增高半元不等、不過經此高峯後、去路又復轉懈、初則市勢尙現徘徊、迄午一般作客旣見市面挫折、悉已縮手觀望、而浮囤散戶更將獲利貨，乘高湧出、乃市色即難維持原狀、立呈軟態、至結果各貨行情比較中市已回貶半元有奇、然比前市猶升五六角不等、計收盤一號西貢四十五元二角、二號四十一元七角、火絞四十三元半、小絞四十元、混合碎三十六元半、米菉三十八元半、三十八元、東京砶尖四十一元、糯米供求相仿、無所榮辱、厚薄粳等國米塲外暗盤亦聞帶起半元、崑錫粳四十七元半至四十六元、靑泗特薄四十六七元早晚稻四十四五元云云、</p>
<p>洋米昨日初漲繼平、終又騰漲、蓋被金市外滙影響外、又以投機活躍、市面隨見倏升倐降、變化不一矣回　期貨有行囤客幫進出、市面更為熱鬧、昨日上下午併有一千二百多噸成交、早市因華洋商擯不售出、且以國外划昂、後定難以接近、市價立被抬高、一號西貢四月份五十三半、二號西貢四月下五月上五十元〇七八角、旋以浮戶出籠買氣稍衰、午市回小數角、但午後金價上騰、又引起本客之吸收、二號西貢大至五十一元二角、其他各米又見喊高、現洋米開六七千包、晨漲一元七八角、午市小七八角、下午雖無正式交易、而行情亦被喊高數角云、</p>
<p>近來米業中人盛傳產銷合作乃是聽從某方有組織糧食運銷公司之企圖、茲據本報記者探悉、該項事務刻正由一部糧商在共同籌備中、擬定資本一千萬元、合組「大昌公司」、以謀疏通國內各區米糧及雜糧來源為宗旨、惟渠輩進行甚為秘密、內慕如何無從知悉、將來對於吾人是禍是福、未能預卜耳、（餘）</p>

<p>粉麥穩定</p>
<p>麵粉　昨市二號粉廠盤站定十三元八角、各號零售每包十三元九角至十四元不等、因其價格高昂、門市零銷、有减無增、故本街零批交易、已不足往日平賣供給之數、客帮去化、更乏暢胃、惟聞烟臺靑島方面邇日稍有運去、故綠砲車客盤仍須十五元餘、而市上回籠粉老車牌等、殊鮮變化、價開十三元七角一分、日廠粉鳳凰牌則已鬆至十三元大關云、</p>
<p>小麥　昨市依然定局、廠定洋麥雖逐有運到、而國麥存底已枯、新麥上市尙屬有待、華廠旣不願放價收買、執貨者亦無遷就之必要、結果由福新阜豐兩廠各辦三百包、價仍為二十三元五角、</p>

<h3>失去一腿的孩子</h3>
<p>— 劉照</p>
<p>王家的那個孩子已有一個月多沒出來玩了，這幾天竟一直就沒有想到他。那天看到他的許多同伴都在弄裏玩，猛然想起了他怎麼一直沒有見，在這許多小朋友的口中，知道了他因平地跌了一交，現在還睡在醫院裏。</p>
<p>據他家裏說，這件事恐怕是有邪——這小孩好好地在玩，平白地竟會　了一交，跌得路都走不來。家裏深怕跌斷了骨，送到醫院裏去，誰知竟從此跌拐了脚，這跌拐了的腿竟又生起瘡來，終於被踞了一隻腿。</p>
<p>在一羣孩子裏，他不很活潑，也不是最聰明，可是他有一種使人可愛的呆直的風度，這種風度在上海的孩子中似乎很難找出的。</p>
<p>前星期，這孩子出院了，還是那麽可愛，可是却裝上了一副木撑脚，少了一隻腿。</p>
<p>頭幾天，一直躱在家裏，不看見他出來，二天後見他倚在他母親的身伴，他母親正在把這不幸的經過沉痛地吿訴她的隣居，許多人都圍在旁邊，對這不幸者表示着非常的同情；這孩子的許多同伴們都用着奇異的眼光望着他，他成了一個可憐的不幸者，他對於自己成了一個跛子，感到莫名的羞恥，別人給與他的同情反使他感到難堪，低着頭，懦怯地溜過眼來偷望着他久違了的同伴</p>
<p>同伴們對他顯得非常生疏了，他現在不能冉加入他們的團體裏去了，孩子們已把他當作了和他們不同的人看待，他們覺得現在他是另外一種人，成了一種所謂「蹺脚」了，他們玩的時候再也不去叫蹺脚同玩了。</p>
<p>有一次，他站在家鬥口，看着他的同伴們在熱鬧地竄來竄去地玩，他高與得嚷了起來：「嗨！你們誰做大王？」可是竟沒有一個人回答他，他們像對大人似的看了他一眼，又自己去玩了。又有一次，他忘了他自己是做跛子了，拐出門來，看見大家在玩得起勁，說：「你們怎麽都不來叫我呀！」「你的脚不是蹺了嗎？」「你蹺脚怎麼能來呢？」當他聽到了這個回答時，他不響了，他的微弱的心受到了最大的打擊，他感到了人生的大悲哀；默默地又拐進了家裏去。</p>
<p>「蹺脚」的渾名很自然而迅速地加到了他的頭上，起初，當人家注視着他的腿而表示驚異或同情的時候，他終是羞慚地低下頭來或轉身回到家裏去；漸漸地，他對於這種同情感到難堪和憤怒，當別人注視他的腿時，他常報之以憤怒的眼光；可是殺近，他似乎已承認了自己是一個跛子，他把他自己的小小的自尊心打破了，當人家注視他的腿時，他不自然地硬裝做沒有事的樣子，表示他並不以自己的跛足而感到羞恥。</p>
<p>「這孩子將來怎麽辦呢？」他母親對於她自己的兒子的前程感到了悲哀，「除了做帳房還能做什麼事呢？」這孩子的前途似乎確已蒙上了一層灰暗的布幕，這社會上會有跛子的立足地麽？</p>

<h3>發明家愛迪生的兒子</h3>
<p>— 陳師超</p>
<p>美國新任海軍部長查理士愛迪生，就是名靈實球電氣發明家湯瑪斯愛迪生的哲嗣。他對於工作的耐久和苦斡，正和他的勤勞父親一樣。但他們互相類似的地方，也僅止乎此。查理士不是發明家那一類的人却是個行政家和實業家。</p>
<p>這位新海軍部長，於一九一三年畢業滿塞秋色州工科大學，即於是年入其父所創辦的工廠任事。一九三一年他的父親逝世時繼任西橋城愛迪生實業公司總理之職。</p>
<p>愛迪生從頭起，就是個新政的熱烈擁護人，於一九三六年十一月十八日，被任為海軍次畏。他的和政局發生關係，尙比此為早。在其未就海决之前，頭任紐傑西州應急局局長，紐傑西州復興委員會及區勞工委員會委員長之職。</p>
<p>查理士，中等身材，談吐溫文爾雅，是羅斯福總統的摯友。從前的黑髮現已漸變灰色的了，他現年四十九歲，但外貌還是很年輕的。</p>
<p>這位新海軍部長，從上次世界大戰時起，就得到很豐富的經騐。當時他的父親任海軍顧問委員會主席，由他任帮辦。同時並監督西橘廠製造作戰材料。</p>
<p>後來任海長史璜生的次長之時，愛氏對於海軍事務的經騐和學識，益見豐富。他對於工廠，船塢，海軍根據地和其他沿　建設，尤特加注意。</p>
<p>他的興趣是屬於智識和自由主義方面的，他就新職以後，大槪是注重徵　海軍人員。他的主要消遣是釣魚，其餘如玩戈爾夫球，收藏圖書和彈奏鋼琴，也是他的嗜好。</p>
<p>愛氏於一八九〇年八月三日生於東橋城。先後就學於嘉大列書院和霍煦基士中學，最後畢業於工科大學。查理士於一九一八年三月二十七日與劍橋霍金絲女士結婚。</p>
<p>職業</p>
<h3>學徒自述</h3>
<p>— 寅</p>
<p>當我十六歲那牟臘月的某夕，父觀對我說：一過今歲，就由其友朋鷺我到一爿木號裏去當學徒，我雖不歡迎，然我明瞭做個男子又不能終生依靠父母，故亦並不怎樣難過，想我哥哥當初出門去時明啼暗泣的情態，多懦弱可憐啊！</p>
<p>翌年元月，我進店了；首先映進我眼簾的，不消說是滿塲堆置的木板，進了店堂，坐淸的都是些生面孔，父親叫我一一的招呼過。我所最注意的，自然是我的先生—經理；但見其面目淸秀，年約三十，中等身材，戴着眼睛，色悅而嚴，言溫而肅，其丯采之英俊，正是我所理想中的一位先生，當時他令我稱之為師兄的，伴我到樓上，安置行李。我隨詢問他的姓名，他亦問起我的籍貫，我們立刻談得很投機，他是我剛進店第二個給我良好的影像。</p>
<p>自此，我開始運用我的「處世之道」—謙恭是待人的惟一要訣，勤儉是處世的不二法門。上自經理下至棧司，我總是謙恭得很，有不懂請問時，自然人家亦樂予指導，凡一切店務都能盡我智力做去，再加上我有足以自傲的字蹟及一手靈捷的好算盤，所以未幾立刻博得了一片「嘖嘖」讚美之聲，號中人員和我無一不好，更沒有和我為難的，我還利用晚上時間，去補習外文。公暇時寫幾篇文稿向各報館。各雜誌投之；所得稿酬，購些書來讀；如此者過了一年。</p>
<p>總之，我所領嘗的學徒生活，雖不能算幸福，却也決不能說痛苦。我自知自己處世之法的不錯，故深信人如能忠實的利用牠，則在自己的前途，無形間已造成了一條幸福的康莊大道。</p>

<h3>「養兒防老」</h3>
<p>— 鈕錚</p>
<p>我們的歷史，已寫下了劃時代轉變的一頁，偉大的現實擺佈在我們的面前，對於「養兒防老」這句古諺，我覺到應該有添一段新的注解的必要。</p>
<p>推原說這句話者的主意，過去，都是以為兒子是屬於個人私有的，養育兒子的目的，是預防自己到年老力衰的時候要兒子來養活自己，從這句話裏我們可推測到的是多麽的沒有國家思想，我國過去的積弱不振，這句話的意義沒有正確的被認識淸楚也是主要的原因。試想一國中所有的兒子個個都去服侍和養他們的父母去了，那末，還有誰來替國家出力呢？戰塲上還有英勇的年靑戰士嗎？</p>
<p>吾人生活的意義不外改造現實的陰暗面，為大衆謀福利，所以為大衆謀福利和改造現實是每個人應盡的天職，但是一個人的「老」是免不了的，年老力衰的時候當然有許多事情是不能去做的。那末為自己繼續努力的是誰呢！負有「改造」責任的重担又交卸給誰去呢？自己兒子自然是再恰當也沒有的人物了。</p>
<p>所以我說，養育兒子是為了防老，預防到了老的時候，不能再替國家，民族或全人類服務。</p>

<h3>春之話劇</h3>
<p>— 鄒哺</p>
<p>這幾天正是各校放假的時候，正當的娛樂當是看話劇之類，現在，我把所看過的三種話劇略加介紹：</p>
<p>（一）「李秀成殉國」在辣斐已經演了六十餘塲，其上演紀錄可與魏如晦的「明末遺恨」媲美。作者陽翰笙大部分據「李秀成供狀」（見太平天國詩文鈔）而作。曹聚仁對此也很有興趣，曾經替以前的新生命書局寫過　本小書，作為大衆文庫之一。主角嚴俊演李秀成很成功，遠勝他在「陳圓圓」中所演的吳三桂。一把短髯，眉宇英俊；尤其最後穿便服的一慕，眞是道貌岸然，配以銅盤中的古劍，益覺李秀成入格的高超，益覺演者的成功。</p>
<p>（二）新近在福煦路俄國藝術劇院的「桃花源」，由大鐘劇社上演，作者是魏如晦。大意叙焦土可以成為新的桃花林，不怕强暴的摧殘。這使我想起郭沫若「女神」中的一首「鳳凰湼槃」詩，在灰堆中可以生出新的鳳凰來。又使我想起一首古詩，中有句云：「野火燒不盡，春風吹又生。」當小女孩許璧所演的收童拿着一枝桃花，從橋上飛一般的跑過來，喊着「新的芽新的芽」時，觀衆都為她的天眞活潑而笑了，都帶着極大的希望而笑了。楊帆喬喬等的歌，配以台下的樂隊，也極悠揚宛轉，甚為動聽；最後，雄壯的合唱，尤使我們激動</p>
<p>（三）「日出」在浦東大樓也已經演過好多天。以前曾看過鳳子的演出，惜未看到第三慕的三等妓院；後雖在日本東京補演完全，也無法看到；這遺憾已由這一次補償了。由於唐槐秋等久住北半的經騐，這一幕的情景是極為逼眞的。這戲劇在現在重演，尤有意義。現在做投機的生意的人實在太多了，潘月亭的失敗很可以做道般人的一個借鑑。演員都很賣力，幾乎無懈可擊。</p>

<h3>娛樂的選擇</h3>
<p>— 盛漪</p>
<p>記得有人說過：「生命中沒有娛樂，正如沙漠中缺少了水一般。」的確，娛樂在人們的生活裏是佔有極重要的地位的。</p>
<p>目前許多人感到苦悶，無聊，這是什麽緣故呢？正為了缺乏高尙的娛樂，工作後沒有精神上的調劑。祗要聽幾支音樂，唱幾首歌曲，以及下棋，談心等等；心胸的煩惱更消滅於無形了。高尙的娛樂常能使人精神振奮，生機蓬勃。然而低級的娛樂却陷人身心於困境：有閑階級以嫖賭或吸食雅片作消遣。結果健康一天不如一天，捧着百病的軀殼呻吟，後悔已經遲了。</p>
<p>高尙的娛樂能創造你的新生命，而低級的娛樂却是摧殘你的健康的，我們對於娛樂不可不慎加選擇。</p>
<h3>王熙春的將來</h3>
<p>— 朱石麟</p>
<p>我承認，熙春是一朶藝苑的奇葩，但她離開成熟之境，似乎還有相當的距離。我們不妨檢討一下的過去和現在，她的美點，値得捧的不妨捧；她的缺點，見得到的不妨矯正一下，這樣，才不致誤了她的將來。</p>
<p>我但聞其名而未識洪人，祇好不談。去年，我到卡爾登去看梯兄的香妃恨，這是我和她見面的第一次。看完戲之後，老實說，我對於王熙春的印象並不怎樣好，因為，香妃的堅貞强毅的性格她是沒有完全表露出來。台上的查妃，祇是一個尋常抖水袖走辮子步的靑衣而已。</p>
<p>最近，她又參加了拍攝電影的工作。電影是現實的戲劇，與平劇的表演方法完全不同；起先，我們還擔心着她也許脫不了舞臺氣息；但是，你看她，胸有成竹地跨進了攝影塲，在鏡頭面前老練地做出各種不同的表悄；在極短促的時間裏背熟極長的台詞；一點也沒有舞臺動作，一點也小慌亂；處處表露出她的演戲的天才；誰也看不出她還是初上鏡頭；這眞是一個奇蹟。</p>
<p>在拍戲期內，我當然和她有相當長久的時間相處在一塊，這使我有從旁觀察她的「私底下」的充分機會。我覺得，她一點也沒有時下名坤伶的一種說不出來的習氣；除了進出多一個「跟包」之外，看小出與其他電影演員有什麼不同的地方。她有着活潑的靑春蓬勃的朝氣；她口沒遮攔，胸無城府；有時候天眞得像一個嬰孩，有時候又調皮得像個頑童；她眞是一個可愛的孩子！</p>

<h3>Fifth Session of the National Political Council Held in Chongqing Yesterday with Opening Ceremony; Chairman Chiang Reports on Military, Political, and Diplomatic Affairs of the Past Six Months; Attending Councilors Numbered One Hundred Forty-Five</h3>
<p>Chongqing—The Fifth Session of the National Political Council held its opening ceremony on the first day at 10:00 AM. In addition to the 145 councilors who registered, the heads of various agencies present included Legislative Yuan President Sun Ke, Judicial Yuan President Ju Zheng, Examination Yuan President Dai Chuanxian, Control Yuan President Yu Youren, Executive Yuan Vice President Kong Xiangxi, Military Affairs Commission Member Feng Yuxiang, Acting Chairman of the Relief Commission Xu Shiying, Minister of Interior Zhou Zhongyue, Minister of Economic Affairs Weng Wenhao, Minister of Military Administration He Yingqin, Minister of Education Chen Lifu, Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang Chonghui, Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Chen Jitang, Minister of Judicial Administration Xie Guansheng, Minister of Central Organization Zhu Jiahua, Chairman of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission Chen Shuren, Director of the Rear Service Department Yu Feipeng, Chongqing Garrison Commander Liu Zhi, and Central Committee members Lu, He Jian, Liu Jiwen, Hong Lanyou, Yang Hu, and over thirty others. Chairman Chiang presided, leading the assembly in customary rituals. All councilors stood in solemn silence for three minutes for the fallen soldiers and compatriots who died in the war of resistance. The atmosphere was solemn and sorrowful. After the silence, Chairman Chiang delivered a speech, reporting on the national military, diplomatic, and political measures taken in the past six months and expressing fervent hopes for the current session. All councilors were exceptionally enthusiastic, listening intently for about forty minutes. Next, Chairman Lin of the National Government gave instructions, which were read on his behalf by Secretary-General Wang Shijie. Everyone stood and listened quietly. Then, Vice-Chairman Zhang gave a speech, followed by a speech by Councilor Liang Shangdong, representing the councilors. Councilor Liang previously represented the National Political Council in the military discipline inspection group in Jiangxi during the winter before last, where he lost his right arm in a Japanese air raid. After a year of recovery, Councilor Tian was publicly elected to give a representative speech, which was deeply moving. (First day dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing—The Fifth Session of the National Political Council opened here this morning. This is the last session before the dissolution of the Council, as the National Assembly will be convened in November to pass the constitution and decide on the date of its implementation. It is reported that issues related to the establishment of a constitutional government will be the main points of discussion at this session, and representatives will also propose a discussion on stabilizing prices. (First day Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops in Tongxu Fail in Northern Advance</h3>
<p>Zhengzhou—On the evening of the 22nd, a unit of Japanese troops from Tongxu in eastern Henan advanced northward. They were intercepted by Chinese troops in the Mazhuang area, where over a hundred Japanese soldiers were killed, and many rifles and machine guns were captured. The remaining Japanese troops retreated eastward. (First day dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops in Western Sui Retreat Near Anbei</h3>
<p>A dispatch from a certain location in western Sui—Chinese troops in western Sui have achieved another great victory, completely routing the Japanese troops who were counterattacking Wuyuan. They are now pursuing the retreating Japanese troops along two routes, southeast and northeast. The remnants of the Japanese forces have already retreated near Anbei (31st dispatch)</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang's Opening Speech</p>
<p>Chongqing—In his opening speech at the Fifth Session of the National Political Council, Chairman Chiang stated that today marks the opening day of the Fifth Session of the Council. The number of attendees is particularly large compared to previous sessions. Even colleagues who are far abroad or have been convalescing in various places and unable to attend in the past have made the arduous journey to participate, reflecting a national spirit of unity in sharing weal and woe, which is deeply inspiring and gratifying. In particular, the work of the colleagues during the intersessions fully demonstrates our determination to take practical responsibility for the work of resistance and nation-building. Our Sichuan-Xikang Construction Promotion Association has established five offices, and the responsible colleagues regularly inspect various regions, report to the government, and provide a basis for all improvements. Our Constitutional Government Promotion Association has held multiple meetings to conduct detailed research on various constitutional issues. We organized a North China Inspection and慰问团, traveling to Shaanxi, Henan, Shanxi, Hebei, and other provinces to慰问 local soldiers and civilians. Our colleagues also participated in the Military Affairs Commission's Military Discipline Inspection Group, going to the front lines to assist in the rectification of military discipline. All colleagues participating in the above-mentioned work have been able to complete their tasks without fear of hardship or danger, and I express my respect to them, especially to those who participated in the work. It has been a full six months since the Fourth Session of the Council adjourned. The international situation has become tense due to the European war, and our war of resistance has also entered a more arduous stage. However, adhering to our established national policy, the front and rear have worked together to intensify the struggle, which has further strengthened the foundation of the war of resistance and brought the work of nation-building to scale. I will now give you a brief report on the military, diplomatic, and political measures taken in the past six months. First, regarding military affairs, at the close of the Fourth Session, I said, "China's fighting strength today is not only far superior to what it was a year ago but also exceeds the beginning of the war of resistance the year before last." Reviewing the past six months, I can say that our military strength in the war of resistance today is even more substantial than it was six months ago, and all techniques and organization have made even more progress. Therefore, the foundation for victory can be said to be completely laid. In the past six months, every time the Japanese army has made a move in northern Hunan, northern Guangdong, southern Guangxi, northern Hubei, southern Shanxi, or western Sui, it has suffered a fatal blow from us. The recent counteroffensive in Wuyuan and the recovery of Lingshan and Funan in southern Guangxi further prove that the Japanese army is at the end of its rope. The Japanese army's routs in northern Hunan and northern Guangdong prove that they will be defeated if they attack, and the Chinese army's recapture of Kunlun Pass proves that they will be destroyed if they defend. In total, the number of Japanese casualties in the past three months has increased by more than 230,000. In the future, they will only decline and be unable to recover, and our strategy will be able to give them fatal blows at any time and in any place, so that they will each come to die within our vast territory, be isolated, and be annihilated in their entirety. Second, regarding diplomacy, we have adhered to the key point of "responding to all changes with constancy" that I reported at the last session, consistently adhering to the established policy. Although the international situation is complex and tense, our position is very simple and clear. Our allies around the world not only have a clear understanding of China, but also unanimously sympathize with us. Although war has broken out in Europe, the moral and material assistance from European and American countries to China has only increased in the past six months. The establishment of a US$20 million loan from the United States is immensely inspiring. Generally speaking, when the Soviet-Finnish war broke out, it seemed that the international situation became more complicated. Now that the Soviet-Finnish war has been restored to peace, the scope of the European war has been reduced. The relationship between the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom, the United States, and France is likely to become closer. I believe that the Soviet Union and all peace-loving countries in the world will be able to stand on the same point of view to safeguard international justice and cooperate to implement its consistent peace advocacy and restore peace to the world and East Asia. Third, regarding our political facilities, the various ministries will submit individual reports to the conference on the detailed progress of the administrative work in the past six months. What I want to explain to you now is the center of our administrative planning and implementation in the past six months. In addition to the negative prohibitions of banning concubinage, gambling, eliminating bandits, and providing relief to those suffering from disease, we are also working hard to promote health and promote sports. All of these have achieved considerable results. Our active work focuses on internal affairs and economics. A. Regarding internal affairs, we pay special attention to promoting local autonomy and enriching grassroots politics to establish a constitutional foundation. In September last year, the government promulgated the "Outline of County-Level Organizations." On the one hand, it planned the training of autonomous personnel, and on the other hand, it formulated various implementation regulations and raised the necessary funds, and decided to start implementing it uniformly throughout the country from this year.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Complete Failure of Japan's Diplomatic Offensive</h3>
<p>Ambition belongs to Japan, conspiracies and tricks belong to Japan, but what about the future? I don't need to reason, our opinion is that Japan's current strategy is painstaking and useless. At least, as a Japanese soldier told an American reporter, "It is very vague and difficult to achieve results."</p>
<p>Honesty belongs to China, time and space belong to China. Japan has wasted its efforts and spared no expense in deception. Not to mention providing China with more and better time and space, at least Japan cannot gain anything from time and space. Looking at the speech of the British Ambassador to Japan, Craigie, his words were vague and his intentions ambiguous, not yet to the point of openly flattering Japan's current strategy, but it immediately aroused honest indignation and criticism in his home country and on the other side of the Pacific Ocean in the United States. Looking at Japan's current strategy once it took concrete shape, it immediately aroused the honest declaration of US Secretary of State Hull. Mr. Hull candidly expressed the honest attitude of the United States. He said, "The United States still maintains its right to uphold international law and existing treaties. The United States government, together with other countries, unanimously recognized the National Government of the Republic of China twelve years ago. The United States is convinced that the capital of the Chinese government is in Chongqing, so the United States government has always recognized the National Government as the only legal government in China." The US loan of another 20 million US dollars to China is undoubtedly a huge sum. It is sincere sympathy and strong support for China. It is a merciless reprimand and serious blow to the aggressor. However, Mr. Hull's declaration the day before yesterday is indeed of supreme value, and it cannot be compared with 20 million US dollars or any huge sum. As for the Soviet Union, its government authorities have not directly expressed their views, but the articles and discussions in the newspapers under the Soviet political system have exposed everything without leaving any room. No one can deny that this is a sign of the Soviet government's attitude. Ambassador Craigie's speech should not be regarded as the attitude of the United Kingdom, let alone regarded as France sharing the same view. Looking at yesterday's dispatches from London and Paris, the official positions of the United Kingdom and France, in response to the current clouds in the Far East, stated that "the entire policy remains unchanged and still recognizes the administrative organs under the leadership of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek as the only national government of China."</p>
<p>It is Japan that is disturbing the Far East. As for stabilizing the Far East, China should do more of its obligations, and has already done a great deal of obligation, and is continuing to do great labor. In addition, the United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and France are all important factors in stabilizing the Far East. Now that Japan has just begun to concretize its current strategy, the United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and France have responded "unambiguously" as expected, as mentioned above. Although yesterday's dispatch from Tokyo stated that the Japanese authorities called this reaction "as expected", unless it is a primitive animal, using calmness to suppress anxiety and using indifference to conceal embarrassment, "as expected." Because analyzing Japan's current strategy, if it still confidently uses the way it handles domestic problems to deal with the so-called "China Incident", that is, if it does not regard the Sino-Japanese War as an international problem but as unrelated to the international community, then it would not need the current strategy from the beginning. Therefore, the form of this strategy of Japan seems to be a political offensive against China, but its essence is a diplomatic offensive against the international community. Having used the current strategy and immediately received such a clear and honest response from the international community, it is still said to be "as expected", and it seems to allow disregarding the international community and allowing ignoring it indifferently, which is obviously a deception. Analyzing Japan's original intention, it wants to disguise the international normal and legal way, so it negotiates, concludes treaties, signs, "initials", approves, and exchanges documents, and all the procedures of bureaucratic politics are complete and complete. Then, one hand is "document", and the other hand is the fact, placing it in front of the various countries. Analyzing Japan's tactics, perhaps the Japanese authorities are using bureaucratic political glasses to observe the countries? Or perhaps they received wrong reports from overseas officials? Or perhaps they bought counterfeit goods from foreign spy personnel? It actually mistakenly believed that as long as the "documents" are complete and the facts are present, the countries will shut their mouths and remain silent, and the countries will pretend to be foolish and acknowledge it. Who knows that the countries are not foolish and immediately have a clear and honest response! The decisiveness of the response is like cutting nails and cutting iron! This is really beyond Japan's expectations. If it is said that the Japanese authorities are not anxious or embarrassed because of this, unless they are really foolish, they are pretending to be foolish.</p>
<p>In terms of Japan's entire strategy towards China, all military offensives, economic offensives, and political offensives are internal operations in the entire strategy. The diplomatic offensives that are vertical and horizontal in the international community are roundabout operations in the entire strategy. The purpose of the internal operations is to destroy the Chinese body and eventually collapse it. The purpose of the roundabout operations is to isolate China's international community and eventually suffocate it. Internal destruction and external collapse, in the beginning, he used both methods to speed up China's demise. Recently, although he has not stopped its internal operations, he believes that success in roundabout operations is enough to control China's fate, so he has exhausted his efforts to engage in this aspect. Now, Japan's internal strategy is failing in every way. It is clear that the final and decisive failure is not far away. His roundabout strategy has been definitively proven to have been a complete failure due to the international response in these two or three days!</p>
<p>Therefore, we diagnose that Japan has reached a major turning point.</p>
<p>This work is, of course, a difficult and huge work, but in order to strengthen the power of resistance and promote the success of nation-building, we must complete it quickly with the greatest determination and effort. We must enable the people to receive practical training in exercising their four rights, enable the people to be organized, improve conscription, enrich local forces, and popularize national education. All of these cannot be achieved without implementing this system. I hope that all colleagues will work together and promote it together. B. Regarding economic affairs, we pay special attention to the development of economic construction and the enrichment of financial power. For economic construction, it is necessary to increase industrial and mining production, and also to expand agricultural production. In terms of industry and mining, in addition to actively proceeding in accordance with the established plan, we have recently formulated a further expansion plan, increased funding, and promoted it within a limited time. At the same time, we feel that the sufficiency of war resources and people's daily necessities must fundamentally start from the development of agriculture. Therefore, future facilities must do their best to develop the agricultural economy, enrich rural finance, and increase farmers' production. The independent establishment of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry is to enable agricultural and forestry reclamation to have a dedicated agency. From now on, we must actively promote it according to this policy, and strive to reduce the unnecessary burdens and pains of our people during the war and increase the general welfare of our hard-working people. As for financial affairs, what should be mentioned in particular is the establishment of the Joint Office of the Four Banks. Because in the past two years, the financial foundation has become increasingly solid, and the state's revenue and expenditure have not felt short, a large part of it has benefited from the sound preparation and effective implementation of pre-war financial policies. Now, if we want to step up economic construction, we must further concentrate the strength of financial institutions to promote our entire economic policy. Since the establishment of the Joint Office of the Four Banks, it has been working hard to promote the expansion of the financial network, establish the stability of the foreign exchange base, and absorb and lend production funds. Looking back at the past six months, the contributions and achievements of the four banks have been extremely high. From now on, we must gradually promote it, so that our economic construction can be completed more quickly due to the increase in financial power. The above is a summary of our military, diplomatic, and political facilities in the past six months. Let us take a look at the situation of the Japanese. I have already said that the Japanese military power is declining. What is not necessary to say again is that the domestic political and economic situation has reached the point of collapse. In terms of economy, its total budget this year reached 16 billion yen. Public debt cannot be sold, banknotes are continuously over-issued, rural labor is becoming increasingly scarce, and coal and electricity shortages make it impossible to maintain industry. The people's lives are extremely uneasy, the social foundation is shaking everywhere, and fires are frequent, causing heavy losses. Man-made disasters and natural disasters are countless. In terms of politics, the military is becoming increasingly arbitrary. Just looking at the various events in the Abe cabinet's resignation, the Yonai's ascendance, followed by Saito's departure, and even the 75th session of its parliament in the past few months, it can be seen that only a few soldiers are now dominating everything. It is wholeheartedly trying to disturb East Asia, but it calls itself (establishing a new order in East Asia), intentionally excluding the legitimate rights and interests of various countries in the Far East. Instead, it deceives itself and sings "cooperation" while looking at the opportunity of the European war, trying to speculate and take advantage of it. At the same time, it is trying to play with the great powers and defeat them one by one. Who can't see through this kind of intention? Let's take one or two examples. Japan initially opposed the Soviet Union and enticed Europe and the United States, but the countries of Europe and the United States were not deceived by it. Then it wanted to threaten Europe and the United States by approaching the Soviet Union, but it was despised by the Soviet Union, and the countries of Europe and the United States were not intimidated. Now it wants to use the disguise of anti-Soviet to ease the countries of Europe and the United States. Is there any such stupid attitude that is not universally abandoned by the great powers?

<h3>British Government Does Not Want to Change Its China Policy: Recognizes the Only Legitimate Government in China as Being in Chongqing; French Newspaper Says the Situation in the Far East Has Not Changed Much</h3>
<p>London: According to official sources, some commentators suggest that the recent remarks made by British Ambassador to Japan Craigie in Tokyo are a sign of Britain changing its Far Eastern policy. Although Britain does not want to develop friendly relations with Japan, its overall policy remains unchanged. Britain still recognizes the administrative organ led by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek as the only National Government of China. (31st Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>London: The political correspondent of the Daily Mail expressed his personal opinion that the British government does not want to withdraw its diplomatic recognition of the Chongqing government, nor does it want to grant recognition to the new regime. However, this should not be interpreted as Britain being hostile to the new regime. If there is any sign of a step that could end the Sino-Japanese War on fair terms, British diplomats will cooperate. (1st Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Paris: The "government" established by Wang Jingwei in Nanjing has recently been commented on by the Paris Times, saying, "This government is the product of Japan's extensive diplomatic efforts and large-scale military operations in China. However, whether the evolution of the situation in the Far East has entered a decisive stage can be found by considering the following matters. The Japanese army has been waging an undeclared war against China for two and a half years. Although several provinces in northern and central China and most of the coastline have been effectively occupied, there are still great difficulties in making China and 'Manchukuo' form a group under Japanese control and implement a permanent cooperation plan. The current problem lies in how to form a central regime from the local regimes supported by the Japanese, that is, a regime that can cooperate with Japan in a spirit of mutual trust. Although the 'Wang Government' has been established, Japan is still at war with China. The army commanded by General Chiang Kai-shek is still resisting Japan, and the attitude of the Chinese National Government remains as strong as ever. Under such circumstances, it is not easy for Japan to complete its mission. In other words, Japan must continue to fight until its goals are fully achieved. In China, the forces that are unwilling to cooperate with Japan still exist. All these are political realities exposed after the establishment of the 'Wang Government,' which no one can erase. In addition, since the 'Wang Government' has not been recognized by various countries, and the National Government is still recognized by various countries as the only legitimate government, the United States has already issued a statement on this, which shows that the establishment of the 'In Government' is not enough to make much change to the current situation."

<h3>Future of the Yonai Cabinet: Many Difficulties; Economy Difficult to Adjust; Control Policies Difficult to Implement</h3>
<p>Tokyo: It is expected that since the Yonai Cabinet has passed the difficult hurdle in the Diet, it will now devote all its efforts to implementing its policy of resolving the China Incident along the lines it has previously outlined. The Yonai government is currently facing major political events: (1) Recognition of the regime in China, (2) Adjustment of relations with third countries that have interests in China, (3) Completion of Japan's wartime economic system, (4) Compilation of a realistic budget for the next fiscal year. Regarding the third item, its main points are the problem of prices and increasing the production and supply of war materials and daily necessities. The Price Conference is expected to be established within days, and the public is paying close attention to the true functions of this group. Observers believe that the Japanese government's low-price policy and its expansion of production procedures are difficult to adjust. The supply of rice, coal, fertilizer, and other important items will inevitably be greatly affected by government control. Whether the current government wins popular support will largely depend on the results of this control. Regarding the fourth item, the compilation of a realistic budget, the Japanese government has not yet expressed its policy. According to observers, the compilation of a realistic budget is inevitable, and the army and navy budgets will be affected. It is expected that some parties will oppose the compilation of a realistic budget, so the government will probably encounter serious political difficulties in handling this matter. Even the fate of the Yonai Cabinet will depend on this. As for political issues not directly related to the China Incident, there are the National Spiritual Mobilization Movement and the revision of the government officials appointment and removal system, etc. However, Prime Minister Yonai and other cabinet members have not yet made concrete statements on these issues.

<h3>US Congress Supports Hull Declaration; Some Suggest Immediately Severing Relations with Japan</h3>
<p>Washington: The Democratic and Republican members of both houses of the US Congress today expressed enthusiastic support for Secretary of State Hull's statement last week that the United States refused to recognize the "New Nanjing Nationalist Puppet Government." Some suggestions for imposing an embargo on Japan and other punitive measures are still being treated with caution. Democratic Senator King called for the United States to immediately sever relations with Japan, but Independent Senator Shipstead warned the United States "not to attempt to correct the evils of the old world." (1st Associated Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>New York: The New York People's Forum recently severely criticized the "Nanjing Wang Jingwei Government," stating, "If Japan hopes to achieve practical results by establishing this kind of 'puppet government,' it is too 'fantasy.' If the 'Wang Government' asks the United States to return the concessions and leased territories it holds within China in the future, it may 'annoy' the United States. It should be known that American public opinion will not pay attention to any policies issued by these Chinese traitors who work for the Japanese army. The Japanese government was reportedly scheduled to immediately recognize the 'Wang Jingwei Government' after its establishment. If this is indeed the case, then all the clauses of the Washington Nine-Power Treaty will be violated by Japan, just as the country previously established the 'Manchukuo Government,' which will be even more undeniable. In this situation, we believe that the United States should immediately prohibit the transport of various military supplies to Japan, but there is no need to send an expeditionary force or use the navy to attack Japan. It is enough for us to implement a blockade against Japan in the ports of the western Pacific." (1st Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>New York: The New York Herald Tribune commented on the "New Regime" in Nanjing, saying, "We have no reason to imagine that the establishment of a pseudo regime protected by Japan will have any practical impact on the military situation. Observed from overseas, its significance is nothing more than another violation of treaties by Japan, and it can prove that its previous repeated violations were premeditated and intentional. If China is allowed to be divided into Manchuria and central China, then its violation of the text of the treaty is similar to Japan's formal annexation of the territory it occupies." The newspaper concluded, "We can certainly say that the performance in Nanjing is one of the weakest and most clumsy instances of Eastern hypocrisy." (1st Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Arida Feels More Distressed After Hull's Declaration; Says the Attitude of Third Countries Is Not Worth Caring About; Suma Hopes to Improve Japan-US Relations</h3>
<p>Tokyo: Foreign Minister Arida is now on a trip to the Kansai region to report on his duties as Foreign Minister to the Grand Shrine. Arida told reporters at the New Osaka Hotel that he was unable to criticize reports that the United States would not recognize the "Nanjing New Regime" when he received the official report in the United States. However, in his opinion, judging from the United States' attitude towards the Manchurian Incident, it was not unexpected for the US government to make this statement. The establishment of the "Nanjing New Regime" is a courageous achievement, aiming to seek the happiness of the Chinese people and the peace of East Asia. The "New Regime" has no intention of excluding the legitimate rights and interests of third countries. What it wants now is to readjust Sino-Japanese relations based on the three principles of good neighborly friendship, joint anti-communism, and economic cooperation. Moreover, the Japanese government is currently conducting large-scale military operations, which is an undeniable fact, and what could not be expected in the ordinary situation is now happening. Third countries misunderstand the above two points, so Japan does not care whether third countries recognize the "New Regime" or not, but will improve the situation until third countries have to recognize it. (1st Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman Suma stated this morning at a press conference that the Japanese government will continue to make every effort to improve relations between Japan and the United States. Japan's efforts to achieve stability and peace in China are a disturbing factor in this effort for the United States. He hopes that the US government will be patient and wait for the results of Japan's efforts. The "Nanjing New Regime" will be completely independent and has nothing to do with "Manchukuo." (1st Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Japanese Foreign Minister Arida and Foreign Ministry Information Bureau Director Suma have recently made statements frequently sending overtures to the United States, probably hoping that the United States would adopt a realistic policy on the day of the establishment of the "Nanjing Wang Jingwei Government." However, it was undoubtedly beyond the expectations of the Japanese that US Secretary of State Hull declared in no uncertain terms that the country would never recognize this "New Government." However, the Japanese still appear calm on the surface. Knowledgeable sources have interpreted this, saying that since the United States abolished the 1911 US-Japan Treaty of Commerce, the Japanese government and newspapers have actively carried out a propaganda campaign among the people, arguing that no matter what the United States thinks or does about the situation in the Far East, Japan will ignore it and move forward single-mindedly. Today, the general public's lack of excessive shock at Hull's declaration is probably due to this. For this reason, some foreign observers here believe that Hull's announcement will not only not stop Japan's progress, but the Japanese government may even use it to stimulate people's hearts, so that the general public's determination not to allow Western countries to interfere in Japan's actions can be strengthened. Those in the government say that the policies pursued by the United States in the Far East are gradually diverging from those of Britain and France. For example, the speech delivered by British Ambassador to Japan Craigie the other day was worded exceptionally gently and was sufficient to offset the blow given to Japan by Hull's declaration. However, it is necessary to understand whether the lack of cooperation between the United States and Britain and France is due to genuine differences of opinion or whether they have already secretly agreed to deceive Japan. In short, the Japanese believe that the views of the British and French authorities are completely different from those of the United States, and therefore believe that the British and French authorities may not respond to Hull's declaration. Therefore, Japan can still maneuver between the United States and Britain and France. That is how it views Hull's declaration. (1st Havas Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Economic Problems in North China Are Extremely Serious; Japanese Side Considers It Tricky</h3>
<p>Tokyo: The Japanese Times recently commented on the economic problems in North China, stating, "The New Government" is currently facing "two major problems" that urgently need to be resolved. First, how should Tianjin, which was a major commercial hub connecting North and South China before the war, restore its original position? Second, 80% of the people in North China are engaged in agriculture, and they were able to be self-sufficient in agricultural products in the past. Now, they need to rely on Japan for food. How should this abnormal state be corrected? The economic problems in North China are extremely serious. Before the outbreak of the China Incident, the trade volume between Tianjin and Central and South China, especially Shanghai, reached over 100 million yen, accounting for about half of Tianjin's total trade. However, since the outbreak of the war, this trade relationship has been hit hard. Tianjin and Central and South China can no longer maintain contact and are completely Japanized. However, the goods that Japan exports to the yen bloc have also been restricted. Its trade volume with Tianjin, which originally accounted for 80% of the total, also fell to 45% in 1939. In terms of goods, wheat flour is the main import from Japan, with a value of 75 million yen, accounting for 30% of the total import volume. North China is vast and rich in resources, but it needs to rely on foreign countries for food, which shows that its agricultural economy has fundamentally problems. In short, the interruption of Tianjin's commercial relationship with South China and the stagnation of the agricultural economy have caused North China's foreign trade to change from a surplus to a deficit. Before the China Incident, Tianjin's surplus reached 40 million yen, but by 1938, it had a deficit of 55 million yen. By the end of September 1939, the deficit had increased to 192 million yen. One of the reasons for this situation is the high price increase in Tianjin. For example, wheat flour, which sold for only 5 yen per bag last summer, now costs 30 yen. Sugar, which was originally 30 yen per bag, has also risen to 130 yen. Because of the continuous rise in prices, the public's hoarding is becoming more and more intense, and the import volume has increased accordingly. Therefore, at the beginning of the establishment of the "New Government," the economic rehabilitation of North China is indeed a tricky problem. (30th Havas Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Anglo-French Blockade Policy to Enter New Phase: Restrictions on Goods Imported to Neutral Countries; Territorial Waters System Reportedly to Change</h3>
<p>London. Diplomatic circles here claim that the blockade policy implemented by Britain and France against Germany is about to enter a new phase, with its effectiveness reaching its peak in late summer and early autumn. So far, Britain and France have only inspected goods carried by merchant ships of various countries within the scope of international law. Although this has been remarkably effective and has caused great difficulties for Germany, there are still various shortcomings. For this reason, Britain and France have decided to take stringent measures to restrict neutral countries from purchasing goods on behalf of Germany. However, when implementing this policy, the traditional approach to the rights of belligerent countries must also be changed. Britain and France value the fate of millions of people and will not sit idly by while Germany openly violates international law and ties its own hands. Although there has been no official statement on this matter, the territorial waters system may be changed in the shortest possible time. All neutral countries bordering Germany, especially the Soviet Union, have large stocks of goods and will be closely monitored to prevent them from aiding the enemy. (Havas dispatch from the 1st)</p>
<p>Rome. The speech delivered by the British First Lord of the Admiralty, Mr. Churchill, yesterday has been commented on by various newspapers here, saying that Britain and France will definitely intensify the implementation of the blockade policy against Germany, and the method will almost restrict the import of goods into neutral countries, so as not to be shipped to Germany due to surplus. The implementation of this method will be determined separately based on the actual needs of each country. (Havas dispatch from the 1st)</p>
<p>Amsterdam. Dutch political circles believe that the recent speech by the British First Lord of the Admiralty, Mr. Churchill, is a harbinger of the Allied Powers tightening the blockade. It is expected that the Allied Powers will strengthen the control of neutral countries' exports to eliminate the possibility of food being transported to Germany. (Reuters dispatch from the 1st)</p>
<p>Paris. Political circles here fully agree with the speech of the British First Lord of the Admiralty, Mr. Churchill, and believe that this is the latest and most powerful statement by the Allied Powers to explain their position to neutral countries. What is particularly welcome in the speech are two points: one is that the Allied Powers' enemy is only Germany, and the other is that the Allied Powers do not want to fight against the Soviet Union unless forced by circumstances. (Reuters dispatch from the 1st)</p>
<p>Stockholm. The recent speech by the British First Lord of the Admiralty, Mr. Churchill, mentioned that neutral countries supply Germany with raw materials, which prolongs the war. Political circles here cannot see the reason for this, believing that Britain's emphasis on Sweden's export of iron ore has only recently emerged, and before the outbreak of the war, this type of export was only considered a secondary trade. (Reuters dispatch from the 1st)</p>
<p>Berlin. Newspapers here have made many sarcastic comments on Mr. Churchill's speech. The "People's Observer" stated that Mr. Churchill believes that if neutral countries can join the Allied Powers' front, the war can be ended. However, neutral countries already know Britain's attitude towards Abyssinia, the Spanish Republican Army, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Finland. Other newspapers also ridiculed Mr. Churchill's statement that the total population of Britain and France is 110 million, because the population of Britain is only 42 million, and the population of France is only 38 million, totaling 80 million. It is unknown where Mr. Churchill will obtain the remaining 30 million. (Haitong dispatch from the 1st)</p>
<h3>Resolution of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union: The New Finnish Republic Incorporated into the Soviet Union; Amendment to Article 13 of the Soviet Constitution</h3>
<p>Moscow. The second joint session of the two chambers of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union was held here tonight, presided over by Mr. Shvernik. The meeting discussed the second item on the agenda, namely, changing the Karelian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic into the Karelian-Finnish Soviet Socialist Union Republic. On this point, Deputy Zhdanov delivered a speech, which was well received. After a short discussion, the two chambers voted separately, and finally unanimously passed the above-mentioned case. At the same time, the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union also decided to request the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic and the Supreme Soviet of the Karelian-Finnish Soviet Socialist Republic to submit the accurate demarcation plan of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic and the Karelian-Finnish Republic to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union for consideration. It was also decided to hold an election of representatives to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union in the new republic, and authorized the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet to determine the date of the election.</p>
<p>In addition, the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union decided to amend Article 13 of the Soviet Constitution to include the Karelian-Finnish Soviet Socialist Republic into the Soviet Union. (TASS dispatch from the 31st)</p>
<h3>The Origin of the Name of the New Republic: Report by Zhdanov</h3>
<p>Moscow. Regarding the renaming of the Karelian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic to the Karelian-Finnish Soviet Socialist Union Republic, Mr. Zhdanov recently reported at the second joint session of the two chambers: "According to the Soviet-Finnish peace treaty, the new territories should be transferred from Finland to the Soviet Union. These new territories, especially the Karelian Isthmus, are military bases for attacking Leningrad and the Soviet Union. However, thanks to the heroic operations of the Red Army, the most dangerous war zone on our northwestern border has been eliminated. It has now become a peaceful barrier, guaranteeing the safety of Leningrad, Murmansk, and the Murmansk Railway.</p>
<p>It is found that the new territory covers a total area of 36,000 square kilometers. Therefore, issues such as the organization and economic and cultural development of the area require special attention. Except for a small part, the new territory is connected to the Karelian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, and is similar to the republic in terms of history and national livelihood. Therefore, when discussing the organization of the new territories received by the Soviet Union from Finland, the People's Committee gave full consideration to the legitimate and fair opinions of the workers of the Karelian Republic. Except for a small area directly connected to Leningrad, the new territory should be merged into the Karelian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, together with the cities of Fanpu, Anteria, Kekesen, Sotavala, Suuchavi, and Gaoluchavi. The People's Committee made an appropriate proposal to the Supreme Soviet, requesting consideration. If the Supreme Soviet accepts this proposal, the People's Committee will submit another proposal, which is also the opinion of the workers of the Karelian Republic, proposing to change the Karelian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic into the Karelian-Finnish Soviet Socialist Union Republic.</p>
<p>The Karelian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic has become a glorious land of the Soviets. Under the leadership of the world's workers' leader, Stalin, and the Bolshevik Party, the republic is gradually realizing Lenin-Stalin's national policy. With the support of the Soviet people, the Karelian people have made important achievements in socialist construction and the development of national culture. After we merge the new territories into Karelia, we have enhanced the importance of Karelia and given it important new tasks in terms of national economic and cultural development. The People's Committee and the workers of Karelia are deeply convinced that this newly organized Karelian-Finnish Republic can accomplish this new task.</p>
<p>The Soviet government has now taken steps to connect the areas leading to the Soviet Union and the original area of the Karelian Isthmus. The Petrovitsevtsk-Souchovi Railway, which has already been built, has connected the capital of Karelia and the Murmansk Railway with the Sutaifanla-Fanpu line. In addition, the Gandelaksha-Guluchovi line is currently under construction and will be completed soon. This line will connect the main part of Karelia with the Guluchovi area leading to the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>The industries incorporated into the Karelian territory, except for a small part, are handled by the Karelian-Finnish Soviet Socialist Republic.</p>
<p>After the Karelian Republic is changed to a federation this time, its name needs to be discussed. It is found that the area leading to Karelia is not entirely Karelian. A part is purely Finnish territory. The Finnish and Karelian people have close relations in terms of race and blood. This time, changing the Karelian Autonomous Republic into the Karelian-Finnish Republic will definitely enable the two nations to achieve further development in economy and culture, and further enhance their friendship. At the same time, their years of accumulated hatred will also be eliminated. The People's Committee of the Soviet Union recently exercised its power and drafted regulations on the renaming of Karelia, and submitted them to the Supreme Soviet for review.</p>
<p>This new republic is about to join the other republics of the Soviet Union. This is a major new development in the unity of the various federations of the Soviet Union. During this period of imperialist enslavement of the people, imperialist wars have sharpened national and colonial oppression, and the rights and interests of small countries have become the change in the hands of imperialists. The establishment of our new republic during this period is enough to emphasize the benefits of the Soviet system in guaranteeing the full development of small countries.</p>
<p>I am deeply convinced that the Karelian-Finnish Republic will not only become a barrier to peace and security on the northwestern border of the Soviet Union, but will also become one of the most progressive members of the republic. (TASS dispatch from the 31st)</p>
<h3>Italian Newspaper Criticizes Soviet Policy, Accusing it of Taking Advantage of the Situation</h3>
<p>Rome. The speech delivered by the Soviet Foreign Minister, Mr. Molotov, at the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union the other day has been commented on by the "Standemba" newspaper. This is the first reaction from Italian newspapers. It said, "Although Mr. Molotov's speech was extremely激烈, its content was still ambiguous. However, looking at this speech, the country's attitude since September of last year has been fully exposed. It is found that the country's intention is to make full use of the European war and to take advantage of the situation in Poland and the Baltic coast, and to try to obtain strongholds in Bulgaria and Turkey. In other words, it is pursuing a realistic opportunistic neutral policy towards the European war, waiting for the development of the situation, and its invasion of Finland is one aspect of this policy. At this time, Stalin has already restored his 'neutral' position, waiting for the belligerent countries on both sides to provide the best opportunity to realize his imperialist ambitions and the plans of the Tsarist Russia, so as to promote Bolshevism to the whole of Europe and Asia." (Havas dispatch from the 31st)</p>
<p>Rome. The speech delivered by the Soviet Foreign Minister, Mr. Molotov, at the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union yesterday has been commented on by various newspapers here. The "Times" stated, "The last paragraph of Mr. Molotov's speech declared that the Soviet Union aims to guarantee peace, security, maintain neutrality, and avoid joining the war. This statement is enough to satisfy the various neighboring countries of the country who want to stay out of the war. In Romania, it has always dared not lag behind in supporting peace and ensuring the security of neighboring countries. However, Mr. Molotov's statement that there is no mutual non-aggression treaty between the Soviet Union and Romania is wrong. It is found that the Paris Non-Aggression Pact has been implemented between the Soviet Union and Romania at the request of the Soviet Union. The multilateral agreement signed in London on July 3, 1933, was not signed solely by the Soviet Union and Romania, but it also clearly stipulates the obligation of mutual non-aggression."

<h3>The Soviet Union Temporarily Does Not Appoint Ambassador to France</h3>
<p>Geneva. Well-informed sources in French political circles have received reports from Moscow that the Soviet Union will not appoint a new ambassador for the time being after recalling the ambassador to France, Mr. Suritz. According to newspaper reports, the Soviet Embassy in Paris is currently guarded by the French secret police. (Haitong dispatch from the 1st)</p>
<h3>Full Text of Molotov's Speech (Continued from Yesterday)</h3>
<p>On April 17, 1919, the London "Times" stated, "If we look at a map, we will know that the easiest way from the Baltic Sea to Leningrad is Finland, because the Finnish border is only 十英里 away from Leningrad. In short, Finland is the key to Leningrad, and Leningrad is the key to Moscow.</p>
<p>If we do not trust this plan of the British and French imperialists, then the recent facts in Finland can dispel this distrust. The failure of this plan is not only due to the lack of enthusiasm of the anti-Soviet elements on the British and French sides and the final restoration of reason in Finland, Sweden, and Norway. The failure of this plan is actually due to the glorious achievements of the Red Army in Karelia. What is the basic significance of the Soviet-Finnish peace treaty? The peace treaty has guaranteed the safety of Leningrad and Murmansk. This time, our hopes should be slightly different from those of last autumn. If the Finnish side had accepted our demands last autumn, the war would not have occurred. We have already shed blood in the war. Now we deeply believe that the Finnish government's attitude of hostility towards the Soviet Union is too great, so we have to guarantee the safety of Leningrad on a more solid foundation. When mentioning the issue of the Murmansk Railway and the safety of Murmansk, it is because Murmansk is our only ice-free port in the west, which is extremely important to our foreign trade. We have no other goals in signing the Soviet-Finnish peace treaty this time other than guaranteeing the safety of Leningrad and the Murmansk Railway. However, we believe that this issue must be resolved on a permanent basis. The Soviet-Finnish peace treaty fully recognizes the independence of Finland and expresses the necessity of guaranteeing the safety of Leningrad and the northwestern border of the Soviet Union. Our goal has now been achieved and we are very satisfied with the Soviet-Finnish peace treaty. The economic and political relations between the Soviet Union and Finland have now fully returned to normal. Our government is deeply convinced that the relations between the two countries will definitely develop further. However, we have to warn against certain aspects of the Finnish side's attempts to undermine the peace treaty. Sweden and Finland are now planning to form a so-called military alliance. The Norwegian leader, Mr. Hambro, even suggested that Finland "restore its lost territories" and said that the Soviet-Finnish peace treaty cannot last. From this point of view, the so-called Swedish-Finnish alliance is nothing more than aimed at the Soviet Union. It is found that this issue not only violates Article 3 of the Soviet-Finnish peace treaty, but also violates the entire peace treaty, because the peace treaty has clearly delineated the Soviet-Finnish border. If Finland is loyal to the peace treaty, it will never participate in this alliance. As for Sweden and Norway, if they also participate in this alliance, they have obviously violated their neutrality. The Soviet Union cannot understand their new diplomatic policy. We believe that we have no need to have disputes with Sweden and Norway. The relations between the Soviet Union, Sweden, and Norway should develop normally.</p>
<p>As for the rumors that the Soviet Union demanded to occupy the west coast of Scandinavia and Narvik, etc., they are all anti-Soviet propaganda and not worth laughing at.</p>
<p>So-called "socialist" gentlemen such as Mr. Hangglun of Sweden and Mr. Tolaimier of Norway are attempting to undermine the relations between the Soviet Union and Sweden and Norway. They have obviously been bought by foreign capitalists and sold out the interests of their own countries.</p>
<p>The Soviet-Finnish peace treaty has also resolved the Soviet Union's security issues in the Baltic Sea. The peace treaty supplements the mutual assistance agreements signed by the Soviet Union and the three countries of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. According to the experience we have gained in the past six months, these agreements have consolidated the international status of the signatory countries. No matter how fierce the imperialist anti-Soviet propaganda is, the independence of these three countries has not been affected. On the contrary, the economic relations between the Soviet Union and these three countries have greatly improved. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Strengthening the Black Sea Blockade Issue: Britain, France, and Turkey Fail to Reach Agreement; Britain Denies Making Proposal</h3>
<p>London. According to responsible sources in London, the rumor that Turkey has agreed to allow the Allied Powers' fleet to pass through the Tartar Strait to strengthen the Black Sea blockade is completely groundless, because the signatory countries of the Montreux Convention have agreed that in the war in which Turkey maintains neutrality, no country may send its warships through the strait. If Turkey is also one of the belligerent countries, it still has the right to decide whether to allow the warships of other countries to pass through. If Turkey feels that it is under immediate threat, it can make an exceptional decision. However, according to Reuters' investigation, the Allied Powers have not suggested to Turkey that it is currently under direct threat. (Reuters dispatch from the 1st)</p>
<p>London. The rumor that Britain, France, and Germany have requested the Turkish government to allow the warships of the respective countries to pass through the Dardanelles Strait and the Bosphorus Strait to enter the Black Sea has been denied by British official circles.

<h3>Demonstration by the Danish National Socialist Party Fails</h3>
<p>Copenhagen. The National Socialist Party of the German ethnic group in the Danish province of Schleswig planned to hold a demonstration in the eastern coastal city of Aarhus on the Jutland Peninsula. The party said that 250 people recently traveled from the provincial capital to participate, but as soon as they disturbed the city of Aarhus and left the station, they were arrested by the local police. The demonstration was not held. These people were all wearing National Socialist Party uniforms. The people of the entire city looked at them with contempt, expressing their indignation. Several party members were beaten by the crowd. Fortunately, they were protected by the police and no incident occurred. (Havas dispatch from the 1st)</p>

<h3>Japan Violates Gentlemen's Agreement, Arbitrarily Increases the Number of Candidates, Actually Increasing from Two to as Many as Five; Foreign Residents Express Extreme Surprise at This Conspiracy; The Future of the Public Concession is Truly Cause for Concealed Worry</h3>
<p>Regarding the election of directors of the Public Works Department, the British and American candidates have already been selected. The British side has five candidates: Ke Zijiawei, Luotelike, Maidangna, Hailai, and Miqier, and Bao Qichi. The American side is A. Leman. The Chinese side has five candidates: Yu Qiaqing, Xi Yushu, Yuan Ludeng, Guo Shun, and Jiang Yiping, all seeking re-election. What is noteworthy is that the Japanese side has been slow to produce candidates, and their move to increase the number of directors has become more active. The Japanese side intends to break the "Five-Five-Two-Two" Gentlemen's Agreement that has been observed by the four countries of China, Britain, America, and Japan for many years. Furthermore, they intend to postpone the candidate election that the consul held on the 28th of last month for several days to complete all preparations. Until yesterday, the candidates had been selected, and their number reached as many as five. Therefore, the director election at the Western Taxpayers' Annual Meeting on April 17th will surely be a competition. The following are details of other situations:</p>
<p>Japanese Candidates Announced Yesterday</p>
<p>The Japanese candidates for the current Public Works Department director election were officially announced yesterday afternoon by Lin Xiongji, Chairman of the Japanese Residents' Election Committee. He stated that there are a total of five Japanese candidates for this election, namely: (1) Gao Xiongtailang (Manager of Mitsui Bussan Food Company in this city), (2) Gangben Yiyi (A well-known Japanese lawyer, working at Murakami Law Firm), (3) Gangben Yice (Former Japanese Consul in Seattle, recently a director of the Japanese Textile Industry Association in China), (4) Tian Cheng (Deputy Manager of the China Central Railway Company), (5) Kuroda Keitaro (Chairman of Shanghai Textile Co., Ltd.).</p>
<p>The Reasons Given are Also Very Forced</p>
<p>According to Mr. Lin Xiongji, "The number of Japanese taxpayers in the Public Concession has reached 3,000 (the total number of Japanese residents is said to be 70,000), while the number of British taxpayers is only 2,800. Therefore, it is a natural move for the number of Japanese candidates to increase from one to five. Moreover, the purpose of the Japanese side is to eliminate the monopoly of a certain nationality's directors in Shanghai over public undertakings. All undertakings in the Public Concession should be managed entirely according to the principles of public management," and so on.</p>
<p>British and American Residents Express Surprise</p>
<p>Taxpaying Chinese and British and American residents in this city expressed deep surprise yesterday upon hearing that the number of Japanese candidates had increased from two to five. They unanimously condemned this move by the Japanese as "shameless." A well-known British resident told reporters, "We thought the number of Japanese candidates would increase to four, but the number of five is really unexpected." As for why the Japanese suddenly increased the number of candidates to five, it is generally speculated that the Japanese are using a kind of psychology to try their luck. The Japanese anticipated that this request would be opposed by all parties, but they believed that achieving a small increase could achieve their purpose. Since they have already announced five candidates, an increase of three compared to the past, other nationalities' taxpayers, in addition to being surprised, cannot but make some concessions, especially if the Japanese increase by one or two. Observers paid close attention to the "dramatic" nature of the Japanese announcement of this news yesterday and believed that one should not lightly believe the Japanese's news of "there is no precedent" for this matter until the final moment. The British Residents' Election Committee told reporters yesterday that the committee will raise questions to the polling place about what is going on behind the scenes. This kind of election is of great importance. Although the number of British and Japanese taxpayers may be equal at present, British residents believe that there is a very large difference between the British and Japanese sides in terms of assets and rights, and the British side is naturally more than the Japanese side.</p>
<p>The Future of the Concession is Greatly Worrying</p>
<p>An official from the American Residents' Association stated yesterday, "The American Residents' Association will do its best to encourage American residents in Shanghai to participate in the voting for this election. They very much hope that taxpayers of other nationalities can also take unified action." The Chinese Taxpayers' Association believes that this move by the Japanese will still be difficult to win in this election, and it can be predicted that the five candidates put forward by the Japanese side will not be fully elected in this election. Another opinion of foreign residents is that if the Japanese can obtain an absolute majority in this election, the future of the concession is unthinkable. The so-called "Public Concession" will also become a "Japanese Concession," and they are all extremely worried about this matter.</p>
<p>The Japanese Plan to Use Jewish People</p>
<p>As for general predictions, it is believed that there are about 3,000 Japanese voters, 2,800 British voters, 600 American voters, 600 German and other national voters, and 8,000 Chinese voters. However, the number of Western voters totals 4,000, and the Japanese only have 3,000. It is difficult to believe that the Japanese can win in this election. Even the British side denied this statement yesterday, believing that the number of British taxpayers is not less than the Japanese, and at least can be balanced with the Japanese. However, according to another report, the Japanese will use other nationalities to vote in support of them, and are stepping up efforts in the area north of the Suzhou River. The Japanese are now trying to use the power of ordinary Jewish refugees as supporters of the Japanese candidates. However, another question is whether all the Japanese residents in Hongkou pay taxes to the Public Works Department, and whether their taxation is exactly the same as the way taxes are collected in the area north of the Suzhou River. This question is really difficult to give a definite answer to. The qualifications of Japanese taxpayers are the most important issue.</p>
<p>Mr. Fessenden Makes No Statement</p>
<p>In addition, according to Mr. Fessenden, Director-General of the Public Works Department, he does not want to express any opinions on this announcement by the Japanese. He believes that the election procedure will be carried out as usual, and this move by the Japanese will be difficult to change the original state in the past. According to the Spanish Consulate in Shanghai, as of now, more than 300 Spanish residents in Shanghai have been convened by the consulate. However, they are unwilling to announce which side they will support when voting.</p>
<p>Candidate List Deadline This Afternoon</p>
<p>The Public Works Department's 1940 director election is scheduled to be held on the 10th and 11th of this month. British and American representatives have been elected. The ballots must be delivered to the Director-General of the Public Works Department for verification and receipt before 12:00 noon today, otherwise they will be invalidated.</p>
<h3>The Fake "Central Market" Opens, Monopolization Implemented Today; The Puppet Regime Warns Vendors Not to Trade Privately; Villagers Are Unwilling to Be Exploited and Many Transport and Sell Secretly</h3>
<p>The fake "Central Market" officially opened at 10:00 a.m. yesterday. The Public Concession Police Department authorities dispatched extra detectives to set up posts and guards in the surrounding area yesterday to prevent accidents. The British troops on the Tibet Road Bridge also suddenly increased their defenses. The fake "Central Market" was unable to operate yesterday because vegetable vendors had not received "entry and exit permits," and local goods merchants did not understand the trading methods. It is heard that official operations will begin today. Although the "branch market" on Bailinan Road in Shanghai West opened yesterday, it did not operate. The opening date of the "branch market" in Nanshi is uncertain. The details obtained are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The Fake Market's Announcement Has Harsh Restrictions</p>
<p>After the establishment of the fake "market," the transportation of local goods to Shanghai from various places will be strictly controlled. However, it is still inevitable that ordinary villagers will transport and sell secretly. The Japanese puppets are suffering from the inability to deal with these people, so they posted an announcement in front of the "market" yesterday, warning general local goods vendors to sell all the local goods transported to Shanghai to the "market" and not to trade "privately," otherwise they will be "severely punished." The announcement also listed the local goods that "must not be traded privately" as: (1) Fresh Vegetables, (2) Poultry and Eggs, (3) Pickled and Cured Goods, (4) Salted and Dried Goods, etc. It can be seen from this that the Japanese puppets are in control down to the smallest detail. The number of local goods transported to Shanghai that were intercepted yesterday was not very large, estimated to be about 2,000 pieces. It is heard that the reason is that if all the local goods transported to Shanghai are intercepted suddenly, the general transporters will stop transporting to Shanghai, which would be counterproductive. Therefore, the Japanese puppets decided to adopt a gradual interception method and induce and threaten vendors to sell all local goods to the "market" in the future, and no longer sell them to other merchants.</p>
<p>The Nanshi Branch Market Cannot Open</p>
<p>In addition to the "Central Market" on North Tibet Road, the Japanese puppet agency for controlling local goods in this city also has two "branch markets" in Nanshi and Bailinan Road in Shanghai West. The above two places were originally scheduled to open simultaneously with the "Central Market" yesterday, but only one place on Bailinan Road opened yesterday, but did not operate. There is no news about the "branch market" in Nanshi. As for the reason, according to reliable sources, it is: (1) Local goods merchants in Nanshi refused to participate, (2) The French Concession's No. 16 Pier Iron Gate was not open. It is heard that the Japanese puppets believe that the Nanshi "branch market" can only be established after the No. 16 Pier Iron Gate is opened, so they are trying their best to request the French Concession authorities to open the iron gate. However, it is still questionable whether they can get their wish.</p>
<p>Extra British Troops Strengthen Defense</p>
<p>The fake "Central Market" opened at 10:00 a.m. yesterday. The Public Concession Police Department authorities dispatched four extra Chinese and Western detectives to set up posts and guards in front of the "market" yesterday to prevent accidents, and there was a police dog to prevent trouble. As for the sentry box in front of the gate, a British soldier with a gun stood guard as usual. However, in front of the British military fortress at the bridgehead on Tibet Road, in addition to a British soldier with a gun patrolling from time to time, more than ten new British soldiers have been added inside the fortress to strengthen the defense. As for the various intersections of the barbed wire at the boundary, the Chinese and British soldiers are guarding the posts as before without any increase. Inside the "market," plainclothes secret service agents of the Japanese puppets were densely deployed yesterday, and the security was very tight.</p>
<p>Various Exploitations Are Hated by Vegetable Vendors</p>
<p>Although the "market" opened at 10:00 a.m. yesterday, most of the local goods hawkers and merchants still did not understand the way it was controlled and "operated," so it did not "operate" yesterday. Only an announcement was posted, instructing vegetable vendors to go and purchase "entry and exit permits" and informing general local goods merchants of the procedures for participating in the "market." Yesterday, hundreds of ordinary vegetable vendors were forced to go to purchase "entry and exit permits" because the "market" controlled all local goods in Shanghai. The "permit" is valid for one year from yesterday to March 31 of next year, and must be purchased again after it expires. Ordinary vegetable vendors are all poor people, and they all hate the Japanese puppets' meticulous exploitation. Yesterday, some people even scolded the "market" administrators. As for the operating date of the "market," it has been set to begin today.</p>
<p>Foreign Ships Coming and Going on the Yangtze River</p>
<p>The Japanese flagship Izumo, after leaving Shanghai on March 26, has been moored in the harbor north of Nanjing with other Japanese warships. It is learned that it will leave Nanjing recently and come to Shanghai. The American Yangtze River patrol boat USS Grasshopper sailed to Wuhu yesterday. The Grasshopper left Wuhu in mid-last month and came to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>"New Regime" Postage Stamp Added, Occupied Areas Actually Follow Suit; However, Mail in the Concession Has Been Refused; The Outside World Is Dissatisfied with Tsae Pel-lin's Actions</h3>
<p>The so-called Nanjing "new regime" postage stamp addition on mail by Shanghai Post Office Director Tsae Pel-lin has aroused great attention from the outside world. A correspondent from the Datong News Agency has recorded the details as follows:</p>
<p>Abruptly Followed Suit</p>
<p>According to a correspondent from the Datong News Agency, the Shanghai Post Office, from the 30th of last month, added a round rubber "postage stamp" with the words "Commemorating the Capital Return of the National Government of the Republic of China" on mail from Shanghai to the occupied areas. The "stamp" is about the size of a silver dollar, depicting the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum in the center, with the words "Shanghai" engraved below, and an Arabic date that can be changed.</p>
<p>Course of Coercion</p>
<p>The "postage stamp" was presented on the 25th of last month when a Japanese official from the Asia Development Board, accompanied by a so-called postal director, visited Shanghai Postmaster Tsae Pel-lin, and made two requests: 1. To hang "flags" on March 30; 2. To add a "postage stamp." However, Mr. Tsae refused outright the "flag" incident, as there was a similar request when another organization appeared in Nanjing the year before, but the post office had its own postal flag to hang.</p>
<p>Concession Refused</p>
<p>However, Mr. Tsae was unable to persist on the point of adding the so-called "Capital Return Commemorative Postage Stamp," and abruptly added it to mail sent to the occupied areas. Therefore, from the 30th of last month, in addition to the post offices in the two concessions refusing to comply, the Management Bureau and suburban post offices such as Hongkou and Nanjing quietly complied.</p>
<p>Postal Difficulties</p>
<p>A correspondent from the Datong News Agency visited a senior official of the Postal Administration yesterday morning. He expressed his regret that the Shanghai postal authorities abruptly accepted the above request, saying that Mr. Tsae's action may have been out of a desire to maintain the entire post office, so he did not hesitate to compromise on minor matters. However, in the view of knowledgeable people, this kind of protection is just a cover-up.</p>
<p>Nanshi Continues to Open</p>
<p>In order to prosper and "revive" its occupied areas, the Japanese first cancelled the pass system in Hongkou, Zhabei, and Yangshupu in early March. On the 25th of last month, the Nanshi District pass was also tentatively cancelled for a period of one week. On the expiration date of the 31st of last month, the Japanese side believed that there were no incidents within the boundary during the week of opening, and believed that the "results" were good. Therefore, after consultation with the Japanese Navy and Army stationed in Nanshi, it was decided to continue the opening from yesterday. However, suspicious citizens are still subject to inspection by the puppet police and "female inspectors." The purpose is nothing more than to induce Chinese people to return, in order to develop Nanshi's industry and commerce, and achieve their "prosperity" and "revival" dreams. However, according to inquiries from the Dakwang News Agency to the French Police Department detectives at various iron gates, the French authorities statistically counted the citizens entering and exiting every day after the iron gates were opened. Although the number of people entering and exiting was busier than before after the Japanese side cancelled the passes (an increase of about two-thirds), those coming to the Concession were still more than those entering Nanshi, approximately in a ratio of four to three. Therefore, the Japanese side's attempt has obviously been shattered.</p>
<h3>Standard Electric Clocks Should Be Installed in the French Concession; Citizens Feel Inconvenienced After the Large Striking Clock Was Removed</h3>
<p>Recently, some citizens have suggested to the French Concession administrative authorities to select three locations on Avenue Joffre to install electric clocks to facilitate pedestrians to know the standard time. In major cities in France, there are such roadside clocks. It is reported that the French Concession authorities are considering it. In the Shanghai Concession, only the large clock at the Jianghai Customs is available for the public to use as a standard timepiece. However, if passersby want to know the correct time, they must go to the Bund to find out, which is very inconvenient. In the past, the French Municipal Council was located on Rue du Consulat (near the current Bank of China and the Mai Lan Police Station), and there was a large clock on the roof (the so-called large striking clock), which was sufficient to indicate the correct time to passersby. It lasted for 70 years before and after. Recently, this clock has been dismantled with the relocation of the French Municipal Council, which is regrettable.</p>
<h3>Public Works Department Western Staff Resign; The Retirement Pay Is Very Considerable; The Budget Increases Greatly Including Pension; This Year's Regulation is Over 5.8 Million; Many Department Staff Are Dissatisfied with Their Treatment and Seek to Leave</h3>
<p>According to the English-language North China Daily Mail, the Public Works Department's budget for pensions and retirement pay has increased greatly, partly due to the resignation of many people from the Police Department and the layoffs in the Works Department. A total of nine people were laid off from the Works Department and completed their work on the 30th of last month. The budget for pensions and retirement pay in the last year was 1,604,93 yuan, but the actual expenditure was higher than the budget by one-fifth. This year's budget is 5,810,140 yuan, an increase of 4,205,210 yuan compared to last year. In recent months, many Public Works Department staff have resigned due to dissatisfaction with their treatment and low salaries. The Public Works Department must pay them retirement pay and travel expenses, and the total amount is quite considerable.</p>

<h3>Rice and Grain Industry Holds Joint Meeting to Discuss Production and Sales Cooperation; A Decision Was Made to Reply to the Public Works Department Within One Week; Another 50,000+ Bags of Foreign Rice Were Shipped</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Soybean and Rice Industry Association, upon receiving a notice from the Public Works Department to organize a food production and sales cooperation organization, held a joint meeting of various groups at its meeting place at 15 Avenue Edward VII at 3:00 p.m. yesterday. More than 20 representatives from the Soybean and Rice Industry Association, the Rice Firm Industry Association, the Shanghai North Rice Merchants' United Benefit Association, the South Grain and Cereal Industry Association, and the Resale Industry Association attended. Xing Zhigang was the chairman.</p>
<p>Collecting Opinions</p>
<p>First, a representative reported that Mr. He Dequi of the Public Works Department convened a meeting last Wednesday, often concerned about the city's food supply. Therefore, after consulting the food production and sales cooperation proposal submitted by Jiang Yanfang, he believed that it was necessary to plan and proceed with the organization, in order to stabilize the city's food supply. Later, representatives attending the meeting expressed their opinions one after another, generally believing that the cooperation method was quite reasonable. However, the scope of the entire rice market in Shanghai is wider, and in addition to the groups attending this meeting, there are other rice industry groups and those closely related to the rice industry who have not attended. Therefore, the discussion of organizing rice and grain production and sales cooperation is regrettable for not being able to gather ideas from all parties. Moreover, the capital of the entire rice market is estimated to be 60 to 70 million yuan in national currency, which cannot be concentrated and organized at one time. The following resolutions were then discussed: "This matter is of great importance and cannot be decided by a small number of representatives. The original representatives should request a copy of the original proposal from the Public Works Department, distribute it to each group, convene their own meetings, and discuss and discuss it in the long term. The Soybean and Rice Industry Association should be notified by letter within one week, so as to collect opinions and reply to the Public Works Department."</p>
<p>Contributing Funds for Low-Priced Sales</p>
<p>A committee member also reported that the previous rice industry groups, including the sack industry, were enthusiastic about relief efforts, and the funds raised in the last session amounted to more than 20,000 yuan. In addition to the 100,000+ yuan that has already been paid to the Low-Priced Sales Committee to be used as donations for low-priced Saigon broken rice, it was also suggested that since the third phase of low-priced Saigon rice will end on the 7th of this month, ordinary poor people will lose this cheap rice and grain, which is not the intention of thorough relief. Therefore, the association can donate the remaining 100,000+ yuan as funding to continue holding low-priced sales, and call on the Civil Food Regulation Council and Mr. Yu Qiaqing to donate again to all walks of life to continue holding low-priced sales to benefit the poor until the new rice is on the market. At that time, it also received the support of all the attending committee members, and it was resolved that when continuing the low-priced sales, the association's deposits will be fully paid to the Low-Priced Sales Committee. In addition, at tomorrow's Public Works Department Price Stabilization Committee meeting, in addition to the rice industry group representatives Zhu Zixiang and others attending to report on the rice industry group's meeting situation, Jiang Yanfang, the proposer of the rice and grain production and sales cooperation, will also bring detailed measures on "production and sales cooperation" to attend the meeting.</p>
<p>Strict Investigation of the Rice Market</p>
<p>The city's rice grain reserves are abundant, and the rice supply is not short, but the rice price has fluctuated in recent days. According to the actual situation, sales on this street are not strong, and hoarders have successively sold off due to increased warehouse rent and tight money, and the rice price will not rise again. However, within a week, the price of rice per stone has risen by more than six yuan. The Market Management Committee, fearing that speculators would attempt to manipulate it again, sent the committees to the market with Public Works Department supervisors to monitor the industry's operations. Therefore, at the rice industry tea party market yesterday, the initial rise was very severe. Later, fearing the authorities' actions, the speculative wind stopped, and the rice price began to recover.</p>
<p>Foreign Rice Pours In</p>
<p>Yesterday, foreign ships transported 6,300 sea defense rice, and another 800 tons arrived at the same time. Today, another 20,000+ bags will be transported by the Pingtuo ship, which will dock at the Longmao Warehouse, and 22,120 bags will be transported by the Provost ship, which will dock at the Qichang Warehouse. Both ships were transported directly from Saigon.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops in Xiashi Invade Haiyan, Confronting Guerrilla Troops Across the River; The Intention Is to Protect the Purchase of Silk and Tea</h3>
<p>Haiyan has been stationed by Chinese guerrilla troops for a long time. On March 27, the Suzuki team of Japanese troops stationed in Xiashi suddenly moved towards Haiyan, and have already stationed there, and will be stationed in Yucheng, Shendang, and other places. These three places are all active areas for guerrilla troops, and are also important roads for the Chinese Jiangnan Army to cross the river to the north. Now they are all guarded by Japanese troops.</p>
<p>It is heard that the Japanese troops' move is intended to block the route of the Chinese guerrilla troops, especially in the economic aspect. The silk and tea will be on the market, and the Japanese are already using puppet "cooperatives" to buy tea, and are widely borrowing capital from traitors to buy silkworm cocoons. Therefore, many new orchid factories have been established. There are many new Japanese troops in Yuanhua who are training day and night.</p>
<p>Arresting Good People</p>
<p>Various abuses are inflicted. Xiashi has puppet "tax police teams" stationed in various cities and towns, so that Japanese troops can be extracted to fight against the Chinese guerrilla troops. Gambling dens are rampant in various cities and towns, and prostitution is prevalent. Good customs and discipline have all been destroyed to the fullest extent. The city of Xiashi is relatively prosperous, and Road Zhongli is no less of a scorched earth than Yuanhua.</p>
<p>The American Ship Delayed Arrival in Shanghai</p>
<p>The American President Lines' SS President Taft, after sailing from the United States to Japan this time, sailed directly to Hong Kong and Little Luzon. Now, on its return trip from Little Luzon, it is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai via Hong Kong. It was originally scheduled to arrive yesterday, but it is now known that it will be delayed by two days, and will enter the port at about 11:00 a.m. tomorrow (the 3rd), stopping at buoy 11.12. The first passenger tender will depart from the New Customs Wharf at 10:45 a.m. and return to the New Customs Wharf to land passengers at about 12:15 p.m. The large ship is scheduled to set sail from Shanghai at dawn on the 4th, heading to Japan via Honolulu, and returning to Los Angeles. The last passenger tender is scheduled to depart from the New Customs Wharf at 1:00 a.m. tomorrow (the 3rd) (i.e. morning of the 4th).</p>
<h3>Increased Donations for the Hotel Industry Will Be Implemented Soon; It Was Decided to Postpone the Payment Temporarily; Requesting a Reduction or a Revocation of the Order; The Public Works Department Still Has No Statement</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Hotel Industry Association has repeatedly appealed to uphold justice regarding the Public Works Department's increase in business license donations for the industry from April 1, and has described the industry's current plight, requesting a reduction as an example or a revocation of the order. However, the Public Works Department has not made any statement on this request as of 6:00 p.m. yesterday. According to a report from the New Voice News Agency, the Hotel Industry Association, in addition to deeply hoping that the Bureau will review the matter, also decided to postpone the tax payment until a satisfactory reply is received from the Public Works Department, and has notified the industry members separately. It is heard that the Public Works Department will implement the increased donations for the industry.</p>
<h3>The Salvation Army Temporarily Suspends Sheltering Beggars; The Shelter Established in the French Concession Is Closed; Whether to Continue to Operate in the Future Requires an Order from Headquarters</h3>
<p>According to the English-language North China Daily Mail, the Salvation Army's beggar shelter in the French Concession is scheduled to close tomorrow, and there is no action to establish a beggar shelter in the Public Concession. Therefore, there will be no beggar shelters in Shanghai. According to Salvation Army Commander Ma Ruishan, the Public Concession must have special funding to run a beggar shelter. This plan is still in its embryonic stage. As for the Salvation Army establishing a new shelter, no order has been received from the Salvation Army Headquarters in Peiping, so it cannot be determined at this time. However, the Salvation Army may take over a refugee shelter somewhere when it closes and convert it into a beggar shelter. There are only 130 beggars left in the French Concession beggar shelter, who will be released in the next two days. Fifty of them are young beggars, who will be sent to the Dunxin Road Refugee Shelter. In the past 16 months, the French Concession Police Department has detained more than 8,000 beggars to the Salvation Army shelter.</p>
<h3>Property Owners in Refugee Areas Should Fulfill Obligations</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Shanghai War, Father Jacquinot de Bessenay of French nationality, out of concern for the safety of residents in the Nanshi area, spared no effort to appeal to both the Chinese and Japanese sides, and finally established the Nanshi Refugee Zone, allowing tens of thousands of compatriots to settle down. His great achievements have been praised by all sectors of society. It is now learned that after the opening of Nanshi, more than a dozen landlords of the shelters in the area have demanded the refugees to move out, intending to lease the properties for huge profits, disregarding the displaced refugees. The reporter from the agency believes that this matter has a significant impact, so they inquired with the person in charge of the area about the handling measures. It is understood that Father Jacquinot de Bessenay, after receiving the eviction letters from the landlords, had already instructed the office yesterday to reply to each of them based on the actual situation. The reply letter is recorded as follows: "To the respondents, we have just received your letter stating that you request the removal of the refugee shelter, etc. The case has been submitted to Mr. Jacquinot de Bessenay, Standing Committee Member of the Supervisory Committee, for clarification. The preservation of half of Nanshi's urban area during the Sino-Japanese War is entirely due to the agreement between the Chinese and Japanese governments to designate a portion of Nanshi as a refugee area for the purpose of sheltering refugees. Chinese homeowners should share accommodations with Chinese disaster victims to demonstrate their due obligations. However, the request for eviction is currently difficult to comply with."</p>
<h3>Bloody Incident on Avenue Foch Yesterday Morning: Song Xiquan Shot Dead; Song Worked at a Club Before His Death; Police Investigating the Cause of the Murder</h3>
<p>At approximately 8:30 AM yesterday morning, a shooting occurred at No. 46, Duofu Lane, 504 Avenue Foch. The victim was Song Xiquan from Shaoxing, who worked in a certain place. He was shot in the head and torso, both in vital areas, and died instantly. The shooter fled the scene. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Residing with a Concubine</p>
<p>Song Xiquan, who served in a club in western Shanghai, was over forty years old and from Shaoxing. He lived in the eastern厢 room upstairs at No. 46, Duofu Lane, 504 Avenue Foch. He had a wife and a concubine. His legal wife lived separately at No. 5 Avenue Mandellane, while his beloved concubine, Caiqiu, lived at the Duofu Lane residence. He loved her dearly, so Song often ate and slept there, considering it his comfortable nest, and he was content and did not miss his other home. He usually wore Western suits and used a car for transportation, living quite lavishly.</p>
<p>Strange Guests Bringing Gifts</p>
<p>At approximately 8:30 AM yesterday morning, two strange guests suddenly arrived, carrying four bottles of beer and a male goose, appearing to be delivering gifts. They knocked on the door several times. The concubine's sister opened the door and invited them into the living room. The strange guests falsely claimed that the gifts were for Mr. Song and requested to meet with Mr. Song to discuss something in person.</p>
<p>Two Shots Fired Suddenly</p>
<p>At that time, Song was still sound asleep. Awakened by his sister-in-law, he drowsily, without changing from his nightclothes, got out of bed and opened the door. He caught sight of the two men closely following his sister-in-law, and he did not recognize any of them. Just as he was about to ask, before he could finish speaking, one of the men behind him pulled out a gun and fired two shots. Both hit vital areas, one shot hitting below the right eye in the head, and the other penetrating the left waist and ribs. He immediately fell to the ground, barely breathing.</p>
<p>Died from Severe Injuries</p>
<p>Seeing that their target had been hit, the shooter abandoned the gifts, went downstairs, and fled without a trace. At this time, Song's concubine witnessed the tragic scene, and after being terrified, she began to cry loudly. Her sister reported the incident to the Chengdu Road Police Station. By the time the Chinese and Western detectives arrived to investigate, the shooter had already disappeared. Only two cartridge casings were recovered and taken back to the police station for investigation along with the gifts. A ambulance was urgently called to rush Song to the Shizhong Hospital for treatment, but due to the severity of the injuries and excessive blood loss, he died en route.</p>
<p>Cause Unknown</p>
<p>In the evening, the body was sent to the Jiaozhou Road morgue for examination. The reporter inquired there and found that the deceased was a broad and fat man, covered in blood. None of his family members were present. The cause of Song's sudden shooting is currently under investigation by the police.</p>
<h3>Lawyer Hua's Clerk Extorted Due to Unemployment, Sentenced to Six Months, Suspended for Two Years</h3>
<p>Bu Shouleng, a Shanghai native who used to work as a typist at the law firm of French lawyer Piran Maitre, was dismissed for embezzling rent from the agency. He had been unemployed for over a year. The day before yesterday, at 11:00 AM, when Piran Maitre sent his clerk to the Citibank on the Bund to withdraw money, Bu learned of this and had an idea. He carried a bag of lime powder and a bottle of corrosive liquid and went to wait on the Bund Beijing Road. He stopped the clerk Wu Yunzhang and demanded that he hand over the withdrawn money, threatening to throw corrosive liquid and lime powder at him if he refused. Wu reported him to the police, and he was arrested. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the First Special Court's First Criminal Division and prosecuted for attempted extortion. Judge Feng Shide presided over the hearing. The witness Wu Yunzhang testified that the defendant was his colleague a year ago, and he had not suffered any losses, asking the judge not to punish the defendant. However, he needed to report the facts: when he returned with the $1,500, the defendant met him on the road and asked him to remember their past friendship and help him out by handing over the money without making a fuss, saying that if he were to call the police, he should wait until he had fled far away. Otherwise, he would be arrested and threatened to blind him with lime powder if he did not agree. Feeling scared, he tricked him into returning to the bank to hand over the money. When he walked into the bank, he immediately called the police and had him arrested. The court verified the testimony and questioned the defendant Bu Shouleng, who admitted that he was driven to take risks due to economic hardship. Judge Feng ruled that Bu Shouleng was guilty of attempted extortion and sentenced him to six months of imprisonment, suspended for two years.</p>
<h3>Carpenter Repays Debt; Threatening to Make Trouble; Zhu Linao Arrested Awaiting Sentence</h3>
<p>Zhu Linao, a carpenter, borrowed fifty yuan from Sun Dali, the owner of Sun Fengji Carpentry Shop at No. 37, Lane 498, Huade Road, in November of last year. Because he repeatedly failed to repay the debt, Zhu mortgaged two wooden boxes to Sun. Later, Zhu learned that Sun had sold the wooden boxes for seventy yuan, so he negotiated with Sun. Failing to reach an agreement, on March 26, Zhu forced Sun to the Wanbin Tea House at the intersection of Huade Road and Liaoyang Road and demanded two hundred yuan, but failed. Sun was subjected to violent means, with his hands tied behind his back, and sent to the Japanese Headquarters on Liaoyang Road, where he was accused of stealing the wooden boxes, severely beaten, and forced to sign a note promising to return the money within two days before being released. After this terrifying experience, Sun Dali kept a low profile. Until February 30, a Westerner from the Municipal Council's Donations Office went to Sun's house to collect donations, which he refused to pay, arguing that since he paid donations, he should be protected, but the opposite was true, so he had no obligation to pay donations. After the Westerner learned of the situation, he took Sun to the Yulin Road Police Station to report the incident. Unexpectedly, two military police from the Japanese Headquarters went to Sun's house, ordering him to fulfill the note. Sun's wife telegraphed the police station, who sent Chinese, Western, and Japanese detectives to investigate. The military police had already left, so Zhu Linao was arrested and taken to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the First Special Court's First Criminal Division. The police lawyer Zhang Tianyin prosecuted according to the law, and Sun Dali testified about the situation at the time. When questioned, the defendant's statement was evasive. The presiding judge ordered him to be detained pending sentencing.</p>
<h3>Zhu Zuotong Arrested Last Night</h3>
<p>At 11:30 last night, Zhu Zuotong, manager of the China-America Evening News, went to the Huile Palace at No. 42 Da Xi Road in western Shanghai at the invitation of a friend, Chuan Mou. Just as they were talking, two or three inspectors from the palace came forward and asked Zhu Zuotong and three bodyguards recently hired by Zhu to come outside, saying that someone outside wanted to talk to Mr. Zhu. Hearing this, Zhu got up and went out, followed by Chuan and the bodyguards. Upon reaching the outside, five or six strong men came forward and asked who was Zhu Zuotong. Zhu answered, "That's me." One of the five or six men immediately pulled out handcuffs, and without asking why, handcuffed his hands and used a gun to force the three of them into a car parked there, and drove away at full speed. Zhu Zuotong's own car was also driven away.</p>
<h3>Yesong Shipyard Labor Strike Reaches Agreement; Details Not Released; Demands Accepted</h3>
<p>Since the labor strike launched by 900 workers at the British-owned Yesong Shipyard began more than half a month ago, the company originally hoped that the workers would return to work within three or four days after the strike occurred, but it has not been successful. It is reported that the company and the workers have held several meetings, and yesterday they reached an agreement on "principles". Although the details of the agreement have not been released, the company told reporters yesterday that the company will increase the wages and allowances of the workers as appropriate. According to the demands put forward by the workers, the company should increase the daily salary by one yuan, and the salary for night work should be doubled. During the strike, the workers will not have their wages deducted.</p>
<h3>French Concession Air Gun Drill, Hope All Sectors Pay Attention</h3>
<p>From 7:00 AM to 10:00 AM on April 4, the French army will conduct air gun drills within its defense zone. We hope that all sectors will pay attention.</p>
<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>Dear Editor, According to Ms. Yin Junong, your newspaper published a news item on the 30th of this month about a woman, Yin Junong, accusing her husband of adultery, which is quite inconsistent with the facts. Since she married Chen Zonghui (Yuanliang), the second son of antique dealer Chen Weiquan, through a matchmaker, Feng, Zonghui has been dissolute, unproductive, and has had extramarital affairs. After being advised, he responded with abusive words and even beat her. Her in-laws were also unsympathetic, and she could not bear the abuse, so she returned to her mother's house to live temporarily. It has been five years now. How can it be said that she lingers outside and does not listen to Zonghui's advice, leading to discord? Furthermore, after she married Zonghui, she gave birth to two daughters. Not only did Zonghui not pay for the cost of childbirth, but he also did not care about their subsequent lives. Her alimony is even more out of the question. Is it her failure to abide by the way of a woman, or Zonghui's unkindness? There is no need to elaborate. Recently, after she asked Zonghui to return the advances and other funds, he sent a letter saying that he had rented another house and asked her to live with him, which was instigated by her father-in-law to deliberately pretend to be separated in order to avoid the obligation to support her. Zonghui has been living with the Xianle dance girl for more than a day. Later, after learning of his address, she reported it to the French police, who arrested him at about 5:00 AM. The detectives knocked on the door and entered the room. Zonghui hurriedly fled barefoot to the bathroom. Zonghui's bathrobe and obscene objects were found on Ju Lianfang's bed. Zonghui's shoes were also placed in front of the bed. The bathroom where he claimed to be sleeping only had a military bed, without Zonghui's clothes or men's shoes and socks. Therefore, the police immediately prosecuted him for obstructing family harmony under the criminal law. After Judge Li of the Eighth Criminal Division interrogated him, he ordered Chen Zonghui and Zhou Lianfang to post bail and rescheduled the hearing for 9:00 AM on April 5. The facts are all there, and there is no room for sophistry. Fearing that the outside world will not understand the truth and spread misinformation, we entrust you to convey the correction. Yours sincerely, Wu Youyuan, Lawyer, April 1, 29th year of the Republic of China.</p>
<h3>Weather Forecast</h3>
<p>Xujiahui Observatory, yesterday afternoon at 4:30, weather forecast: Shandong cloudy and sunny around, with southeast to southwest winds. Here and the East China Sea, fog turning to cloudy, wind directionless. Also, yesterday afternoon at 3:00, in the 24 hours before, the highest temperature in this port was 58.8, the lowest 49.3. On the same day last year, the highest was 61.2, the lowest 52.7.</p>
<h3>Small Gambling Dens in Western Shanghai Closed; Large Gambling Dens Still Exist; Prolonging Life by Spending Movement Fees; Huahui Grand Factories Also Temporarily Suspended</h3>
<p>The Japanese Military Police Department had stipulated that all gambling dens in western Shanghai should be closed by the end of February of the lunar year. Later, the owners of various gambling dens asked influential people to intercede with the Japanese side, citing the need to maintain the livelihoods of employees, and were allowed to postpone it for one month. The final deadline was the day before yesterday (March 31). The Japanese Military Police Department immediately sent personnel to notify the various gambling dens to implement the order. The owners of various gambling dens then convened a temporary meeting at a certain place. After some discussion, they once again obtained</p>
<p>Japanese Agreement</p>
<p>From April 1, more than ten smaller gambling dens will be closed first. The remaining ones, such as Qiulan, Yuyuan, Zhaofeng, Yilu, Huile Palace, Xilaimen, Monte Carlo, Kaixile, Victoria, Dasheng, Lao Rongsheng, Fusheng, and more than ten others, interceded with a certain party and spent a large amount of movement fees, so they were allowed to prolong their life.</p>
<p>Temporarily Exist</p>
<p>However, it is also necessary to limit them to within two years, and gradually eliminate them by means of lottery. The Hollywood, Paradise, and Songyuan Gambling Den at No. 626 Haig Road, which are of great scale, are ordered to completely reorganize within two months, only allowing them to be changed to the nature of a club general meeting, and not allowing open gambling. Since yesterday, more than ten small gambling dens such as Xiangsheng, Shenji, and Daxing in western Shanghai have all been closed. The various gambling dens have jointly organized a post-employment committee to handle the resettlement of</p>
<p>Gambling Den Employees</p>
<p>In addition, Huahui listening tube agencies and other agencies have also been completely suspended since yesterday. Also, it is reported that the Asian General Meeting Gambling Den at No. 65 Gordon Road has also announced its closure since yesterday (April 1). All employees have been dismissed. The scale of the gambling den can be said to be the best in Shanghai, with hundreds of thousands of people entering and leaving every day. The person in charge is a Cantonese man named Liang, who has now returned to Hong Kong fully loaded.</p>
<p>Huahui Agencies Also Suspended</p>
<p>Since the fall of Shanghai, the Japanese puppet regime, due to insufficient economic sources, has resorted to all kinds of extortion. In various places such as western Shanghai, Nanshi, Zhabei, Hongkou, and Pudong, they have allowed the establishment of gambling dens and huahui, openly selling opium and collecting huge amounts of harsh taxes, so that the various areas have become smoky and miasmic, becoming a source of evil. Although many parties have pointed out the sales, the Japanese puppet regime has ignored them. Now, with the imminent implementation of the temporary agreement on cross-border road construction and police affairs between the Municipal Council and the puppet "Municipal Government," the Japanese side, in addition to closing some of the gambling dens yesterday, has also closed the Huahui general factories, grand factories, branch factories, and Huahui listening tube branches, such as Yiji, Deji, etc., in western Shanghai. However, the districts of Nanshi, Hongkou, Zhabei, and Pudong still exist, harming society. It is unknown when they will be cleared.</p>

<h3>Sharing Strange Articles</h3>
<p>Last year, during the Hangzhou children's examination, the second question was: "While Qi has its territory, chickens crow." Yesterday, I met a friend from Hangzhou who said that in a child's paper, after the second comparison, reading it made one stick out one's tongue! The text said: "Suppose there are chickens that are yellow, and chickens that are white, and chickens that are either yellow or white; although the colors of the chickens are different, their crowing is the same. Now, the chickens of the neighbors are robbed every day, which is a constant occurrence for the people of Qi. Is the crowing of these chickens the crowing of chickens robbed from the neighbors? Or is it the crowing of chickens raised by their own family?" Reading it, one feels that it truly deserves the four words "fantastic imagination." But unexpectedly, its comparison is even more extraordinary. The text said: "Let us not discuss whether they are female chickens or male chickens, and let us not discuss whether they are chickens that neither sleep nor are male; although the chickens are different, their crowing is the same. Crowing like a chicken is a skill of many Qi visitors, so is the crowing of these chickens the crowing of Qi people imitating it? Or is it the crowing of many who regard each other as crowing? One imagination is bizarre, and one feels that there has never been such a thing. Some say that the two comparisons, the writing is smooth and logical, linking the upper and lower sections, with everything being thorough, is merely the game of a scholar."</p>
<p>Dog Burial Village</p>
<p>The loyalty and treachery of people will be judged by later generations. When Yue Wu Mu was framed by Qin Gui, imprisoned, and suffered all kinds of torture, the power of the traitor was at its peak. By the time later, those who mourned at Yue Wang's tomb rubbed shoulders, and the West Lake became much more beautiful because of this. Qin Gui was spat upon by the world for all eternity. Outside Wulin Gate in Hangzhou Province, dozens of miles from the city, there is a village. According to legend, it was the secluded residence of the traitor Qin Gui. Later generations hated it and named the village Dog Burial Village.</p>

<h3>Finance: US Dollar Appreciation, Once Approaching the 6 Yuan Mark, Soon Slightly Returning to Level, HSBC Maintains Sterling</h3>
<p>The foreign exchange market yesterday saw no change in HSBC's listed rates. The unofficial market for sterling and the US dollar was relatively tense due to the relationship between Monday and the beginning of the month, and the trend was rebounding, especially for futures, resembling the beginning of last week. The morning opening was due to the increase in sterling-US dollar exchange rates, leading to a decrease of 0.015625 in sterling, to 4 pence and 1/8, while the US dollar was level, at 6.0625 yuan. Soon, speculators took the lead, followed by Hong Kong dealers, and the activity of Japanese firms became more significant. For a time, buying exceeded selling, and the market showed signs of softening. Sterling remained unchanged, while the US dollar reached 6 yuan, and the futures price was particularly tight. By the close of trading, as demand eased slightly, it loosened slightly. The US dollar was 6.03125 yuan. In the early afternoon, it remained stable, but before long, speculators re-emerged, pushing the US dollar towards settlement, once reducing it to 5.96875 yuan (breaking the tight price of 6 yuan on the 27th of last month), but only for a very short time. Fortunately, HSBC made every effort to supply advance orders, about 100,000 pounds or so throughout the day, so the sterling price of 4 pence and 1/8 remained unchanged until the evening close. The US dollar was re-quoted at 6 yuan, resulting in a tightening of 0.015625 and 0.0625 compared to the previous day. The underlying trend of futures and spot were both seen to diverge.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Dealers Settled First, Followed by Japanese Firms</p>
<p>In the early morning, overseas exchange rates for sterling against the US dollar, Shanghai, and France were level. The US dollar rose 0.0625 against sterling, 0.125 against France, and 5 cents against Shanghai. The central government's listed rates for various currencies remained unchanged. The bank's opening selling price for spot was 4 pence and 1/8 for sterling and 6.0625 yuan for the US dollar. Compared to the end of last week, sterling was tight by 0.015625, while the US dollar was neither up nor down, due to a slight increase in exchange rates. After the opening, foreign firms were quite eager to sell, but at that time there were few speculators, so the market was slightly firmer in a quiet manner. It is estimated that foreign firms sold this month's US dollar at 5.9375 yuan to speculators, while spot US dollars were also quoted at 6.09375 yuan. HSBC's listed rates were announced and remained unchanged. The white silver balance tax was also announced and did not rise or fall. After that, a certain bank slightly took a position, and it returned to level. At 10 o'clock, Hong Kong telegrams suddenly entered the market, speculators followed suit, and Japanese firms also became active, so the market suddenly became tight and soft. It is estimated that Hong Kong telegrams entered the spot US dollar at 6.03125 yuan, and May US dollars at 5.75 yuan, and speculators settled April US dollars at 5.90625 and 0.875 yuan, May US dollars at 5.75 and 0.6875 yuan. Later, Chinese merchants entered the spot US dollar again at 6 yuan. At that time, spot sterling was still stable, firmly standing at 4 pence and 1/8, while futures slightly followed the decrease, with April only at 4 pence and 0.03125, and May only at 3 pence and 0.9375. At noon, speculators gradually decreased, and the spot US dollar slightly returned to firmness. Until the noon close, it was 6.03125 yuan, with sterling still at 4 pence and 1/8, tighter by 0.03125 compared to the morning opening for sterling and US dollar.</p>
<p>The Underlying Trends of Futures and Spot are Both Seen to Diverge</p>
<p>The after-market opening was stable, still at 4 pence and 1/8, and 6.03125 yuan. After a short while, as speculators continued to enter the market, the market trended downward again. It is estimated that overseas Chinese entered April sterling at 4 pence and 0.015625, and also absorbed the spot US dollar at 6 yuan from Chase and other firms. Later, they purchased April US dollars at 5.8125 yuan from a certain bank. At that time, the spot US dollar was surprisingly quoted as high as 5.96875 yuan, and April sterling was also quoted as low as 4 pence. After entering, speculators were slightly lacking, and the situation gradually stabilized. Extending to the close, the US dollar returned to firmness, reaching 6 yuan, while sterling remained at 4 pence and 1/8. April sterling was 4 pence and 0.015625, the US dollar was 5.84375 yuan, May sterling was 3 pence and 0.921875, and the US dollar was 5.65625 yuan. As a result, compared to the end of last week, spot sterling was tight by 0.015625, the US dollar was soft by 0.0625, April sterling was soft by 0.03125, the US dollar was expensive by 0.0625, May sterling was reduced by 0.046875, and the US dollar was tight by 0.09375.</p>
<h3>Buyers Like Crazy, Gold Prices Soar Uncontrollably, Approaching 5,600 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spot market for cash smelting saw an initial weakness in the morning, but reversed and surged later, with the momentum gradually intensifying, creating a new historical record for gold prices. This was because the exchange rate market was tightening, and people were all buying gold as the only way to profit. Although chips were occasionally released on the market, they were immediately absorbed. At that time, the lowest price was 5,380 yuan. Afterwards, banks and cash dealers bought in, while securities dealers and money changers had mixed sales, so it hovered around 5,400 yuan for a long time. After 10:45, as the foreign exchange rate declined, securities dealers and a certain Japanese bank secretly bought heavily, and money changers and others absorbed it fiercely, so the price rose sharply and was difficult to stop. The afternoon surge was particularly dramatic, reaching an unprecedented high price of 5,590 yuan (breaking the peak of 5,450 yuan on the 27th of last month). However, as the foreign exchange rate returned to firmness, the buying momentum gradually dissipated, and it slightly declined, with the closing result still at 5,555 yuan, an increase of 145 yuan compared to the noon close of the previous weekend. The whole day's transactions went from clear to prosperous, about four thousand several hundred taels. Jewelry from Yubu Gao increased by 15 yuan, also creating a shocking record of 560 yuan. Customs gold, etc., remained level.</p>
<p>The Whole Day Soared by Over a Hundred Yuan</p>
<p>Since the morning opening, with the foreign exchange rate reported level and people's sentiment turning weak, sellers gathered from all directions. The opening fell by 30 yuan, with banks offering cash dealers ten taels for 5,380 yuan. Afterwards, some banks took the opportunity to aggressively buy in, and cash dealers and a few retail investors also searched for it, although securities dealers and money changers sold out, it was still felt to be insufficient, so it gradually rose by 37 yuan. A bank entered 30 taels for securities dealers, for 5,417 yuan. After that, the foreign exchange rate was stable and slightly firm, and securities dealers and others continued to sell out, and banks released profits, and then fell slightly by 35 yuan. Jin Hao released 50 taels to money changers, for 5,382 yuan. Immediately afterwards, a certain securities dealer suddenly turned from selling to buying, and the foreign exchange rate was reported to be soft, and the market trend was firm. At around 11:00, it broke the 5,400 yuan mark again. Afterwards, as the foreign exchange rate continued to be tight, people's sentiment was particularly strong, and banks, money changers, and securities dealers scrambled to absorb it fiercely, and retail short sellers made up for their positions, and dozens of yuan were raised again. Jin Hao entered 30 taels for banks, for 5,465 yuan. At noon, the US dollar was slightly level, and banks and retail longs took advantage of the high price to close out, and then returned to a small 20 yuan. Banks traded 20 taels with each other, for 5,445 yuan, as the noon closing price. The after-market potential was particularly strong, and the opening jumped up 55 yuan. Jin Hao entered 20 taels for banks, for 5,500 yuan. Afterwards, the foreign exchange market was still reported to be tightening, and a certain money changer and a certain securities dealer competed to buy aggressively. Soon, it jumped another 90 yuan. Securities dealers entered 30 taels for money changers, for 5,590 yuan. However, a certain money changer suddenly came out again, and retail longs also sold out, so it fell back by 55 yuan. Jin Hao released 20 taels to money changers, for 5,590 yuan. Taking into account that a certain money changer came to search for it again, and Jin Hao also bought, it was raised another 50 yuan. Jin Hao entered 40 taels for banks, for 5,585 yuan. After entering, securities dealers took advantage of the high price to release it again, and at the same time, banks issued floating longs, and it returned to a small 30 yuan. Jin Hao released 20 taels to banks, for 5,555 yuan, as the evening closing price. As a result, compared to the weekend noon closing, it rose by 145 yuan, and the whole day fluctuated by 210 yuan. The selling price of cash dealers' own brand gold was higher than smelting, and the purchase price was reduced by 20 yuan, and the current bid gold was lower than the listed gold by more than 50 yuan, and none were made.</p>
<p>Jewelry at 560 Yuan</p>
<p>The exchange rate for gold jewelry per tael was initially still 545 yuan at Datong Bank. At 11:20, it was increased by 5 yuan. At 2:10 in the afternoon, it was increased by 5 yuan again. At 2:15, it was increased by 5 yuan again. As a result, it was a total of 15 yuan higher. Datong Bank changed its suspension to 560 yuan, and the new bank had the same price as the above price. The above all created unprecedented high prices since the market was established. The purchase price was reduced by about 15 yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currencies Rise Frequently</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw a continued demand for sterling and US dollars, and market prices continued to rise. This was because black market gold appeared at new high prices. The supply and demand for sterling notes was still balanced, but the underlying trend was still firm. US dollar notes were still fluctuating and unstable, initially falling to 16.3 yuan, and then trending towards firmness. In the afternoon, the US dollar broke through the 6 yuan mark, so it once rose to 16.62 yuan, which was 2 cents higher than the previous highest price. After that, due to profit-taking, the evening market slightly declined to 16.52 yuan. Hong Kong notes trended firmly along with the Hong Kong-Shanghai exchange rate. The demand for French franc notes was not weak. There was strong demand for Singapore, Dutch, Canadian, and Philippine notes. The rebound in Japanese gold notes was still strong, and the evening market was 1.294 yuan. The demand for Korean notes was increasingly strong, and the evening market was 1.02 yuan. Yesterday's market prices saw the largest increase in sterling and US dollars, each rising by 3 yuan, followed by the increase of 20 cents in Dutch notes. Sterling notes, US dollar notes, Singapore, Canadian, and Philippine notes all rose by 10 cents, Hong Kong notes rose by 1 cent, French franc notes rose by 2 cents, and the rest remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Discount Rate Rises Step by Step, Resulting in Another Increase of Two Yuan, Interbank Lending Rate Also Rises by One Cent</h3>
<p>Yesterday's discount rate for bank drafts and bills first rose and then fell. In the morning, it once flew up to 69 yuan per thousand yuan, but soon fell back to 67 yuan at noon. In the afternoon, it retreated to 66 yuan, which was 2 yuan higher than the previous Saturday. The interbank lending rate of the Money Industry Association rose by one cent, and both the morning and afternoon markets were listed at 19 cents.</p>
<h3>Securities: Domestic Debt Itself Has Its True Value, How Can It Be Different Because of Empty Words?</h3>
<p>The unofficial securities market yesterday trended upwards again. People's sentiment was excited due to the depletion of chips, and the environment was quite stable. Rumors and news were beneficial to various bonds. In fact, how could domestic debt itself be increased or decreased by empty words? Unexpectedly, the price rose again. Although the foreign exchange rate was at a new low and gold was at a new high, the proportion of market prices to the market has changed, and it seems to have broken away from the previous practice of gold prices rising and government bonds falling. There is no shortage of longs in the market, because if only one is monopolized, the rest must rise with it. The trend is feared to be unpredictable by ordinary eyes. Yesterday's transactions saw more retail transactions in the morning, but more were entering than exiting, and the market was slightly firm. In the afternoon, the 20th continued to search for Type E bonds, and Hengkang also bought a lot of Type E bonds. For a time, the chips suddenly felt lacking, so it broke through the 9 yuan mark again, and the rest also unanimously improved. As a result, it improved by 1 to 3 cents, with a turnover of about 800,000 yuan. The 96, which had not been opened for a long time, also had 20,000 yuan in turnover. A simple table is listed below. The 96 is compared to the market on January 16th.</p>
<p>Stock transactions: 50 shares of Bank of China were traded at a price of 71.5 yuan.</p>
<p>In the general stock market, due to tight credit, more sellers emerged. Several stocks were able to resist this pressure at one point, such as Jardine Matheson, China Land Reclamation, International, and Shanghai Banking Corporation, among others. However, near the close, they also succumbed, and the closing price was the lowest of the day. Rubber stocks, regardless of the tight exchange rate market and the upcoming announcement of dividends by several rubber companies, were also affected equally and fell.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Hong Kong Dealers Procure Spot Yarn, Double Horse Rises Another 35 Yuan</h3>
<p>The yarn market continued to rise, and the rise was violent. This was because demand in the south was picking up, and Hong Kong dealers were coming one after another. Therefore, people's sentiment was unusually enthusiastic, and the market rose straight into the clouds. This kind of rise is inevitably too much, and the reaction in the future should also be guarded against. However, spot sales are good.</p>
<p>At the morning opening of the yarn market, it was heard that the foreign exchange rate was slightly higher, the gold price was level, and people's sentiment was still calm. The opening price of 20-count Double Horse yarn for April was 1,070 yuan, slightly falling to 1,065 yuan. Later, it was heard that Guangdong dealers were actively trading spot goods, so the market rose step by step, and people's sentiment was even stronger. Buyers flocked in. 20-count Double Horse yarn for April rose straight to 1,094 yuan. A mid-day transaction statistics checked 3,700 bales, and the market for 20-count Double Horse spot rose by 35 yuan. Also checked cotton yarn exports: 212 pieces were shipped to Wenzhou, and 75 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong. The amount purchased by each dealer is listed below:</p>
<p>Hong Kong 1,650 Mainland 25</p>
<p>Fellow Dealers 1,800 Total 3,700</p>
<p>Local cotton transactions were still mediocre, but foreign cotton transactions were still not bad. However, the market was unusually ordinary. This was because Indian cotton prices were very weak, and various firms ordered a lot. Recently, Indian and American cotton have been coming in continuously, so local cotton has been suppressed by it. Although yarn prices are rising sharply, the cotton market has been depressed. The current cotton situation is as follows:</p>
<p>Tong Da Bale 212.00 Fellow Dealers entered 107 pieces</p>
<p>Also 214.00 Also 105 pieces</p>
<p>Omla 212.00 Also 205 pieces</p>
<p>Bailu Qu 213.00 Also 500 pieces</p>
<p>Pingguo Er 178.00 119.00 Also 379 pieces</p>
<p>Bailu Qu 220.00 Shenxin 5 pieces</p>
<p>Pingguo Er 182.00 Also 3 pieces</p>
<p>Xia Sha Hua 220.00 Also 2 pieces</p>
<p>Tongzhou Hua 207.00 Fellow Dealers entered 200 bales</p>
<p>Tong Da Bale 213.50 Also 100 bales</p>
<p>Additional news: foreign cotton market prices, the New York cotton market, rose in the morning opening due to speculative buying. Later, due to buying by fellow dealers and some short covering, the closing price was higher than the previous day by five or six pounds. India fell five rupees or more, including predictions. Egypt rose three to five pounds.</p>
<p>Shanghai foreign cotton transactions: yesterday, due to the start of the Guangdong dealers' spring sales of cotton yarn, spot yarn transactions were active, and raw cotton transactions were also triggered by small transactions. Indian cotton spot goods in the hands of fellow dealers in the market were unexpectedly bought up. All parties' intentions were also high for raw cotton selling prices. The raw cotton prices with the US dollar at 6 yuan converted to delivered prices are as follows:</p>
<p>20 Count American Met Lin 289.60</p>
<p>20 Count Also Lower Grade 278.90</p>
<p>32 Count Also 305.65</p>
<p>32 Count Also Lower Grade 294.75</p>
<p>42 Count Also 307.20</p>
<p>42 Count Also Lower Grade 297.00</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Raw Soybean Oil Stagnant Sales, Opening Prices All Fell by Four or Five Yuan</h3>
<p>Raw Oil: Yesterday, the actual sales were not strong, and the accumulation of oil on the market was abundant, so the market price gradually decreased. It has fallen by 12 or 13 yuan compared to the highest peak of last month. The trend in the early morning was still slightly decreasing. In the afternoon, a large number of longs sought to sell out urgently, resulting in greater volatility. The market prices fell sharply again and again. As a result, peanut oil fell by five yuan, and 200 pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil were traded at a price of 70 yuan. 3,000 cans of Yantai canned raw oil were traded at a price of 91 yuan. 60 barrels of Qingdao barrel raw oil were traded at a price of 100 yuan. Checked its source, 6,125 cans came from Yantai yesterday, and today 3,690 cans are shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Soybean Oil: Yesterday, the opening price of soybean oil also fell sharply by 3.5 yuan. 300 pieces of Jiaozhou soybean oil were traded at a price of 70 yuan. 100 dan of local factory soybean oil were traded at a price of 78 yuan. 40 barrels of Qingdao barrel soybean oil were traded at a price of 104 yuan. 90 barrels of Dalian crude oil were traded at a price from 106.5 yuan, falling step by step to 104.5 yuan. Checked the source, 157 pieces came from Yantai yesterday.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Gold Rising, Cotton Cloth Prices Rise Aggressively, Market Demand Exceeds Supply, New Prices Set for Colored Cloth</h3>
<p>Domestic Cloth: Yesterday's market rose, and the situation was aggressive. At the morning opening, Yih Ho coarse cloth rose by 2.5 to 5 cents per piece, and Lun Chang floral cloth rose by 2.5 cents. Various factory fine cloths and fine twills rose by 2.5 cents. Bleached and dyed cloths rose by 5 cents. In the afternoon, with gold rising sharply, fellow dealers and Guangdong dealers' intentions were stronger, and there were few suppliers. Most temporarily adopted a wait-and-see attitude. The market price continued to rise by 2 or 3 cents per piece. Various factory colored cloths are expected to set another price. In the afternoon, most had no market. The most active transactions were on this street. More than 500 pieces of fine cloth and fine twill greige goods were traded. Guangdong dealers bought more than 200 pieces of blue cloth, colored twill, bleached cloth, and fuji silk. Ningwu dealers bought nearly 300 pieces of group cloth, bleached and dyed cloth. Ningwu dealers bought several thousand pieces of colored cloth, bleached cloth, coarse cloth, and printed cloth. Hong Kong dealers bought 50 to 60 packages of fine cloth, coarse twill, and fine twill.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: The rise is violent. White fine cloth continues to rise by one yuan per piece, fine twill rises by 5 to 7.5 cents per piece, and serge rises by more than one cent per yard. Dealers from Beilu, Tianjin, Yantai, Qinhuangdao, etc. bought more than 1,500 pieces of fine cloth for the current month's delivery. This street also bought 1,500 to 1,600 pieces of fine cloth and fine twill, but mostly spot goods. Longtou fine cloth opened at 32 yuan for the current month's delivery, and 32.75 yuan for the next month's delivery. Four Gentlemen serge is rising now, with a quoted price of 93 cents per yard, and 96 cents for the next month.</p>
<p>Exports: Today (2nd), there are 60 pieces of piece goods shipped to Hong Kong, and 155 pieces shipped to Guangzhou.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Diaoqing Production Price Reported Tight</h3>
<p>According to yesterday's telegram from Holland, the price of Group White sugar was slightly angled, with the C.I.F.K.G. example at 8.80 guilders. The public society market was stable. The spot price of 24 Group White sugar was 63 yuan at the local warehouse, 62.8 yuan for new goods at the outer warehouse, and 7 cents for old goods, and 49 yuan for re-exports, with no major changes. Taikoo Cart White slightly rose. The price of B Mark East Warehouse was 68.5 yuan, the West Warehouse was 69 to 69.1 yuan, rising 2 cents, the CW Mark was 68.5 yuan, rising 3 cents, the CX Mark was 68 yuan, rising 5 cents, the DY Mark was 67.5 yuan, and the HX Mark was 67 yuan, with the same increase. The East Warehouse was refunded for goods, the H Mark Cart Red rose by 1 yuan, the new goods were 47.5 yuan, and the old goods were 47 yuan, the Dutch Red rose by half a yuan, the WA Mark was 50.5 yuan, and the re-exports were 41.5 yuan. The local factory's cotton white and rock candy have no ups and downs. According to news from Guyu, the production price of Diaoqing rose by 1 or 2 yuan, and the tight trend has not weakened.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Raw Silk Plummets in Price, Local Silk Transactions Show No Development</h3>
<p>Yokohama silk prices uniformly declined yesterday. Spot price was 1580 yuan, near-term 1576 yuan, and far-term 1571 yuan. Compared with last Saturday, the decline ranged from 25 to 42 yuan. At the close of the afternoon session, the market remained sluggish, with spot at 1575 yuan, down 5 yuan; near-term at 1560 yuan, down 6 yuan; and far-term at 1552 yuan, down 19 yuan.</p>
<p>There was not much development in local silk transactions yesterday, as everyone is waiting for today's New York market conditions.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 1463 packages of tea arrived from Hong Kong, and another 200 packages arrived from Tianjin.</p>
<h3>Medicinal Materials: Trichosanthes Peel Arrives</h3>
<p>Trichosanthes peel is... [The original text is incomplete here.] I checked the previous market... I believe that dozens of packages shipped by Huaguo Wheel by vendors at the end of last month are still under inspection, and transactions will likely be completed soon.</p>
<h3>Grains: So-Called Production and Sales Cooperation in Rice and Grain; Japanese and Chinese Grain Merchants Jointly Establish the Dachang Company to Jointly Control the Sales of Rice, Wheat, and Miscellaneous Grains; Foreign Rice Prices Rise Again, Supply Still Abundant; Rice Inventory is Truly Large, Circulation Accounts for Only 25%</h3>
<p>After the rice market turned bullish, yesterday, the sentiment was even better. The morning market saw a rush to buy, with the inland merchants showing the strongest interest, and local shops were also not to be outdone. Speculators and small-scale hoarders were also seen selling and buying, competing to acquire goods, causing prices for general merchants to rise unusually, with prices increasing by one yuan within a short period. For example, No. 1 Saigon rice opened at 45.5 yuan. Afterwards, the sales market became even more active, with prices rising all the way up, increasing by another 0.5 yuan or so. However, after this peak, the market softened again. Initially, the market still showed some hesitation, but by noon, general merchants, seeing the market falter, all withdrew to observe. Speculators and small-scale hoarders sold their profits at high prices, making it difficult for the market to maintain its original state, and it immediately softened. As a result, the prices of all goods compared to the mid-market fell by more than 0.5 yuan, but still rose by 0.5 or 0.6 yuan compared to the previous market. The closing prices were: No. 1 Saigon at 45.2 yuan, No. 2 at 41.7 yuan, Huojiao at 43.5 yuan, Xiaojiao at 40 yuan, mixed broken rice at 36.5 yuan, rice green beans at 38.5 yuan and 38 yuan, Tokyo polished rice at 41 yuan. The supply and demand for glutinous rice were similar, with no gains or losses. The outside dark market for thick and thin japonica rice also heard of a rise of 0.5 yuan, with Kunshan japonica rice at 47.5 to 46 yuan, and Qing Si extra thin rice at 46 or 47 yuan for early and late rice, and so on.</p>
<p>Foreign rice initially rose yesterday, then stabilized, and finally rose again. This was due to the influence of the gold and foreign exchange markets, as well as active speculation, causing the market to rise and fall rapidly, with inconsistent changes. Futures trading was conducted by hoarders and merchants, making the market even more lively. Yesterday morning and afternoon combined, more than 1200 tons were traded. In the morning market, due to Chinese and foreign merchants being reluctant to sell, and because foreign prices were high, making it difficult to approach, prices were immediately raised, with No. 1 Saigon rice for April at 53.5 yuan, and No. 2 Saigon for late April and early May at 50.078 yuan. Later, as speculators released their goods, buying interest weakened slightly, and the afternoon market fell by a small amount. However, the rise in gold prices in the afternoon attracted absorption by local merchants, with No. 2 Saigon reaching as high as 51.2 yuan, and other rice prices also rose. Currently, there are 6000 to 7000 packages of foreign rice open, rising by 1.7 to 1.8 yuan in the morning, and a small amount in the afternoon market, although there were no formal transactions, prices were also shouted up by several jiao.</p>
<p>Recently, people in the rice industry have been spreading rumors about production and sales cooperation, which is said to be an attempt by a certain party to organize a grain transportation and sales company. According to inquiries by our newspaper reporter, this matter is currently being jointly prepared by a group of grain merchants, who plan to establish the "Dachang Company" with a capital of 10 million yuan, with the aim of opening up sources of rice and grains in various regions of the country. However, their progress is very secretive, and the details are unknown. Whether it will be a blessing or a curse for us in the future cannot be predicted. (Remaining)</p>
<p>Another batch of rice from abroad arrived in Shanghai. The Yihwo Shipping Company’s “Mingxing” ship arrived from Haiphong the other day (Sunday) with 6380 bags. In addition, the “Desheng” ship arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning with 800 bags from Hong Kong. Also, from the same ship, 304 bags of foreign rice were transferred to Yantai and 2255 bags of foreign rice were transferred to Tianjin. It is said that another large batch will arrive in Shanghai today on the Norwegian ship “Arbent,” which is directly shipping more than 20,000 bags from Saigon and is expected to enter the port this morning and dock at the Longmao Wharf in Pudong for unloading. Also, the Norwegian ship "Proteus," carrying 22,120 bags from Saigon, is also scheduled to arrive today and dock at the Qichang Warehouse in Pudong for unloading. The amount of rice accumulated in Shanghai is no less than 700,000 to 800,000 bags, but only about a quarter of it is circulating in the market. (Zu)</p>
<p>Flour and Wheat Stable</p>
<p>Flour: Yesterday, the market price of No. 2 flour from the factory was stable at 13.8 yuan, with retail prices for each bag ranging from 13.9 to 14 yuan. Due to the high price, retail sales at stores have decreased rather than increased, so the wholesale transactions on this street are no longer as numerous as in the past when supplies were sold at flat prices. Customer demand is even less active. However, it is reported that some shipments have been transported to Yantai and Qingdao recently, so the customer price for green gun carriage flour still requires more than 15 yuan, while returned flour and old brands in the market have not changed much, with prices opening at 13.71 yuan. The price of Japanese-made Phoenix brand flour has loosened to the 13 yuan mark.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday, the market remained stable. Although foreign wheat has been arriving gradually, the inventory of domestic wheat has dried up, and the new wheat market is still pending. Chinese factories are unwilling to lower prices to purchase, and holders of goods have no need to compromise. As a result, Fuxin and Fufeng factories each purchased 300 bags, with the price still at 23.5 yuan.</p>

<h3>The Child Who Lost a Leg</h3>
<p>— Liu Zhao</p>
<p>Wang’s child hasn't come out to play for more than a month, and I haven't even thought about him these past few days. That day, seeing many of his companions playing in the alley, I suddenly wondered why I hadn't seen him. From the mouths of these children, I learned that he had fallen on the ground and was now sleeping in the hospital.</p>
<p>According to his family, this matter is probably cursed—the child was playing fine, and suddenly he fell and couldn't walk. The family was worried he had broken a bone and sent him to the hospital, but who knew that he would twist his foot from the fall. The twisted leg then developed sores and eventually had to be amputated.</p>
<p>Among the group of children, he wasn't very lively, nor was he the most intelligent, but he had a kind of endearing simple demeanor, a demeanor that seemed hard to find among children in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Last week, the child was discharged from the hospital. He was still as cute, but he was fitted with a wooden crutch and was missing a leg.</p>
<p>For the first few days, he hid at home and wasn't seen outside. Two days later, I saw him leaning against his mother, who was telling her neighbors about the unfortunate incident in a painful way. Many people were gathered around, expressing great sympathy for the unfortunate child. Many of his companions were looking at him with strange eyes. He had become a pitiful unfortunate person. He felt a nameless shame about becoming a cripple. The sympathy that others gave him only made him feel embarrassed. He lowered his head, timidly peeking glances at his long-missed companions.</p>
<p>His companions seemed very unfamiliar with him. He could no longer join their group. The children had treated him as someone different from them. They felt that he was now another kind of person, one of the so-called "cripples." They would no longer call the cripple to play when they were playing.</p>
<p>Once, he stood at the doorway of his house, watching his companions running back and forth playing excitedly. He happily shouted out, "Hey! Who's going to be the king?" But no one answered him. They glanced at him as if he were an adult and went back to playing. Another time, he forgot that he was a cripple and hobbled out of the door. Seeing everyone playing enthusiastically, he said, "Why didn't you call me?" "Isn't your foot crippled?" "How can you come if you're crippled?" When he heard this answer, he was silent. His weak heart suffered the greatest blow. He felt the great sorrow of life. Silently, he hobbled back into the house.</p>
<p>The nickname "cripple" was naturally and quickly added to his head. At first, when people stared at his leg and showed surprise or sympathy, he would always lower his head in shame or turn around and go home. Gradually, he felt embarrassed and angry about this sympathy. When others stared at his leg, he would often respond with an angry look. But recently, he seemed to have accepted that he was a cripple. He broke his own small self-esteem. When people stared at his leg, he unnaturally pretended that nothing was wrong, showing that he wasn't ashamed of his lameness.</p>
<p>"What will this child do in the future?" His mother felt sadness about her own son's future. "What else can he do besides being a bookkeeper?" The child's future seemed to be covered by a layer of dark cloth. Is there a foothold for cripples in this society?</p>

<h3>Edison’s Son, the Inventor</h3>
<p>— Chen Shichao</p>
<p>The new U.S. Secretary of the Navy, Charles Edison, is the son of the famous practical electrical inventor Thomas Edison. His endurance and diligence in his work are just like those of his industrious father. But that’s where their similarities end. Charles is not an inventor, but rather an administrator and industrialist.</p>
<p>The new Secretary of the Navy graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1913, and in the same year, he joined the factory founded by his father. When his father died in 1931, he succeeded as the general manager of the Edison Industries Company in West Orange City.</p>
<p>Edison, from the beginning, was an enthusiastic supporter of the New Deal. On November 18, 1936, he was appointed as the Undersecretary of the Navy. His involvement with the political situation was even earlier than this. Before taking office, he first served as the director of the New Jersey Emergency Relief Administration, the chairman of the New Jersey Recovery Committee, and the chairman of the District Labor Committee.</p>
<p>Charles is of medium height, with a gentle and refined manner, and is a close friend of President Roosevelt. His former black hair has now gradually turned gray. He is currently forty-nine years old, but still looks very young.</p>
<p>The new Secretary of the Navy has gained a wealth of experience since the last World War. At that time, his father was the chairman of the Naval Advisory Board, and he served as an assistant. At the same time, he supervised the West Orange factory in manufacturing combat materials.</p>
<p>Later, when he served as the Undersecretary of Navy under Secretary Swanson, Edison's experience and knowledge of naval affairs became even richer. He paid particular attention to factories, docks, naval bases, and other coastal construction projects.</p>
<p>His interests are in the fields of intellect and liberalism. After taking up his new post, he is likely to focus on recruiting naval personnel. His main pastime is fishing. Other hobbies include playing golf, collecting books, and playing the piano.</p>
<p>Edison was born in East Orange City on August 3, 1890. He studied at Groton Academy and Hotchkiss School, and finally graduated from the Institute of Technology. Charles married Catherine Hawkins of Cambridge on March 27, 1918.</p>
<p>Profession</p>
<h3>An Apprentice's Autobiography</h3>
<p>— Yin</p>
<p>On a certain evening in the twelfth lunar month when I was sixteen years old, my father told me: After this year, I will be sent to a lumber shop by his friend to be an apprentice. Although I didn’t welcome it, I knew that a man couldn’t rely on his parents for life, so I wasn’t too sad. Thinking of my brother’s state of crying and sobbing when he left home, how weak and pitiful!</p>
<p>In the first month of the following year, I entered the shop; what first caught my eye was, of course, the lumber piled all over the place. Entering the shop, all those sitting there were unfamiliar faces. My father asked me to greet them one by one. What I paid most attention to was naturally my master—the manager. I saw that he had delicate features, was about thirty years old, of medium height, wore glasses, was pleasant but strict, and his words were gentle but serious. His handsome demeanor was exactly the kind of master I had always imagined. At that time, he had someone who was asked to call him “elder brother” take me upstairs to arrange my luggage. I then asked his name, and he also asked about my hometown. We immediately got along very well. He was the second person to give me a good impression after I entered the shop.</p>
<p>Since then, I began to use my "way of dealing with the world"—humility is the only key to treating people, and diligence and frugality are the only methods of conducting oneself in the world. From the manager down to the shop assistants, I was always very humble. When I didn’t understand something and asked, people were naturally happy to guide me. I did everything in the shop to the best of my ability, and I also had handwriting and nimble abacus skills that I could be proud of, so it wasn't long before I earned a chorus of "tsk-tsk" of praise. Everyone in the shop got along well with me, and no one made things difficult for me. I also used my evenings to study foreign languages. In my free time, I wrote some articles and submitted them to various newspapers and magazines. With the proceeds, I bought some books to read. I lived like this for a year.</p>
<p>In short, the apprentice life I experienced, although not happy, definitely cannot be said to be painful. I knew that my way of dealing with the world was not wrong, so I firmly believed that if people can faithfully use it, then they will have unknowingly created a happy and broad road for their future.</p>
<p>Random Thoughts</p>
<h3>"Raising Children to Prevent Old Age"</h3>
<p>— Niu Zheng</p>
<p>Our history has already written a page of epoch-making changes. Great realities are being laid out before us. Regarding the ancient saying "raising children to prevent old age," I feel that it is necessary to add a new annotation.</p>
<p>To trace the origin of this saying, in the past, it was thought that sons belonged to individual private property, and the purpose of raising sons was to prevent oneself from having to be supported by one's sons when one became old and weak. From this saying, we can infer how little national ideology there was. The fact that the meaning of this saying was not correctly understood was also a major reason for China's long-term weakness. Just imagine, if all the sons in a country went to serve and support their parents, then who would come out to contribute to the country? Would there still be brave young soldiers on the battlefield?</p>
<p>The meaning of our lives is nothing more than transforming the dark side of reality and seeking welfare for the public. Therefore, seeking welfare for the public and transforming reality are the inherent duties of every individual. However, the "old age" of a person is inevitable. When one is old and weak, there are naturally many things that one cannot do. So, who will continue to work hard for oneself! To whom will the responsibility of "transformation" be handed over? One's own son is naturally the most appropriate person.</p>
<p>Therefore, I say that raising sons is for the prevention of old age, to prevent oneself from being able to serve the country, the nation, or all of humanity when one is old.</p>
<h3>Mind Your Own Business</h3>

<p>Zhang: "Old Li, the weather is so nice, why are you wearing a raincoat and galoshes? Are you going crazy?"</p>
<p>Li: "Because the neighbor's cat died."</p>
<p>Zhang: "Ha, that's really strange! What does the neighbor's cat dying have to do with you?"</p>
<p>Li: "Then what does me wearing a raincoat and galoshes have to do with you?"</p>

<p>Entertainment Circles</p>
<h3>Spring Drama</h3>
<p>— Zou Bu</p>
<p>These days are when the schools are on vacation, and the proper entertainment should be watching dramas, etc. Now, I'll briefly introduce the three kinds of dramas I've seen:</p>
<p>(1) "Li Xiucheng's Martyrdom" has been performed more than sixty times at the Lafayette Theatre, and its performance record is comparable to Wei Ruhui's "Regrets of the Late Ming Dynasty." The author, Yang Hansheng, mostly based it on "Li Xiucheng's Confession" (see "Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Poetry and Prose Excerpts"). Cao Juren is also very interested in this, and once wrote a small book for the former New Life Bookstore as part of the Mass Library series. The protagonist, Yan Jun, is very successful in playing Li Xiucheng, far better than his Wu Sangui in "Chen Yuanyuan." With a short beard and handsome eyebrows, especially the last scene in plain clothes, he is truly dignified. Coupled with the ancient sword in the copper plate, it makes Li Xiucheng all the more outstanding, and the performer's success all the more apparent.</p>
<p>(2) The "Peach Blossom Spring," recently performed by the Great Bell Drama Society at the Russian Art Theatre on Avenue Foch, is by Wei Ruhui. The general idea is that scorched earth can become a new peach blossom forest, unafraid of the destruction of violence. This reminds me of a poem "Phoenix Nirvana" in Guo Moruo's "Goddess," in which a new phoenix can be born from the ashes. It also reminds me of an ancient poem, which contains the line: "The wildfire cannot burn it out, the spring breeze blows it back to life." When the little girl Xu Bi, who plays the shepherd boy, runs across the bridge with a peach blossom branch, shouting "New buds, new buds," the audience all laugh at her innocence and vitality, and laugh with great hope. Yang Fan, Qiao Qiao, and others' songs, accompanied by the band in the audience, are also extremely melodious and moving; finally, the magnificent chorus makes us even more excited.</p>
<p>(3) "Sunrise" has also been performed for many days at the Pudong Building. I had seen Fengzi's performance before, but unfortunately I didn't see the third act in the third-class brothel; although it was fully restaged in Tokyo, Japan later, I still couldn't see it; this regret has been compensated by this time. Due to Tang Huaiqiu and others' long-term experience in the north, the scene in this act is extremely realistic. This drama is even more meaningful when it is restaged now. There are really too many people doing speculative business now, and Pan Yueting's failure can be a lesson for such people. The actors are all very hardworking and almost flawless.</p>

<h3>Secrets of the Film Set—How to Dub</h3>
<p>The original title was "Secrets Behind the Silver Screen," but for fear that readers would misunderstand that the dubbing work was done behind the screen when the movie was shown, it was changed to "Film Set" to show that this is the dubbing method used during film production.</p>

<h3>Choice of Entertainment</h3>
<p>— Sheng Yi</p>
<p>I remember someone saying, "Life without entertainment is like a desert lacking water." Indeed, entertainment occupies a very important position in people's lives.</p>
<p>Many people currently feel depressed and bored. What is the reason for this? It is precisely because of the lack of noble entertainment, and the lack of spiritual adjustment after work. As long as you listen to a few pieces of music, sing a few songs, play chess, chat, etc.; the troubles in your heart will disappear invisibly. Noble entertainment can often make people feel refreshed and full of vitality. However, low-level entertainment puts people's bodies and minds in a difficult situation: the leisure class uses prostitution, gambling, or opium smoking as pastimes. As a result, their health deteriorates day by day, they hold a body full of diseases and groan, and it is too late to regret.</p>
<p>Noble entertainment can create a new life for you, while low-level entertainment destroys your health. We must be careful in choosing entertainment.</p>
<h3>Wang Xichun's Future</h3>
<p>— Zhu Shilin</p>
<p>I admit that Xichun is a wonderful flower in the art world, but she seems to be quite a distance away from maturity. We might as well review her past and present. Her good points are worth praising; her shortcomings, if we can see them, can be corrected, so that we don't ruin her future.</p>
<p>I have only heard of her name and have never met her, so I can only avoid discussing it. Last year, I went to the Carlton to see Brother Ti’s Xiang Fei’s Hatred, which was the first time I met her. After watching the play, honestly, I didn’t have a very good impression of Wang Xichun, because she didn’t fully express the steadfast and strong character of Xiang Fei. The Xiang Fei on the stage was just an ordinary actress shaking her sleeves and walking in small steps.</p>
<p>Recently, she also participated in the work of filming movies. Movies are realistic dramas, which are completely different from the performance methods of Peking Opera. At first, we were worried that she might not be able to get rid of the stage style; but you see her, confidently stepping into the film set, and skillfully making various expressions in front of the camera; memorizing extremely long lines in a very short period of time; without any stage movements, without any panic; everywhere she reveals her talent for acting; no one can tell that she is still filming for the first time; this is truly a miracle.</p>
<p>During the filming period, I naturally had a fairly long time to spend with her, which gave me ample opportunity to observe her "privately" from the sidelines. I think she doesn't have the unspeakable habits of today's famous female actors at all; except for an extra "follower" coming in and out, I can't see any difference between her and other movie actors. She has lively youth and vigorous energy; she speaks her mind without reservation and has no hidden thoughts; sometimes she is as innocent as a baby, and sometimes she is as mischievous as a naughty child; she is truly a lovable child!</p>

<h3>News of Actors</h3>
<p>— Jing</p>
<p>Female actor Xu Xiuwen wanted to return to Beiping after the Kui De Troupe stopped performing at the Imperial Palace Grand Theatre, but she was persuaded by friends to stay, so she did not go with all the actors of the Kui De Troupe when they went north on the Shuntian Wheel. Now she has decided to return on the 6th, and all procedures and ticket purchases are in progress.</p>
<p>Xin Yanqiu has stopped performing for renovation since yesterday. The results of this performance are satisfactory. She and the supporting actors have decided to take the train back to Ping on the 5th. Yu Zhenfei will also return to his hometown in Suzhou to sweep the tombs.</p>
<p>Golden New Corner Cheng Yanqiu and his party arrived in Shanghai yesterday and will perform starting tomorrow.</p>
<p>The Yifeng Drama Society's five new plays of The Erudite Official will begin to be launched at the Carlton Grand Theatre and will probably premiere at the beginning of next month.</p>
<p>Li Hongchun received a telegram from his home in Ping, stating that his old mother had passed away. Hongchun was unable to rush back to Beiping for the funeral, so he remitted 500 yuan to handle the funeral. He himself continues to perform in Shanghai as usual.</p>
<p>Warning Against Plagiarism: The article "Liu Biejian's Vision of Garbo" by "Jialu" on the 29th was found to be plagiarized from other books. The manuscript fee has been cancelled, and it is hoped that he will not destroy his credibility again in the future. (Editor)</p>
