<p>重慶　可靠消息頃稱、外部爲封鎖滇緬公路事、已向英國提出强烈抗議、而認此舉爲非法、然此間官方、並不認緬甸公路封鎖之消息爲一打擊、據官方稱、由此路運輸物品、且不經濟、並稱經由西北路、滇緬公路封鎖後由中國之唯一國際交通生命綫之入口出口貨運、當更頻繁、而中國與蘇聯之關係、亦更趨於密切、中國與蘇聯之密切、卽由民主國家不能充分援助中國所致、此外報界方面、亦抨擊、民主國家之缺乏活動性、中央日報嚴厲抨擊英國對緬甸公路之態度、該報稱英國係受國聯援華議決案之拘束者、且以誠意遵守國聯議案著稱者、極不應從事此種相反行動、設英國容許日本對緬甸公路之要求、則事勢卽形成日本侵略印度緬甸之第一步、該報請英國自墮日本彀中、並指陳承認日本要求、卽喪失英國聲威、（十五日合衆社電）</p>

<p>倫敦　泰晤士報外交訪員聲稱、華盛頓傳來美國對於英國於緬甸公路運輸軍器入華問題、暫時對日讓步之非正式訾議、要知此項談判刻仍在進行中、美方訾議似均以關於談判情形之不實消息爲根據、且據倫敦負責方面指稱、此項談判並不妨碍英政府將來行動之自由、英政府暫時取締緬甸與中國間若干種物品之運輸、並不束縛英政府之手腕云、（十五日路透社電）</p>

<h3>英調停中日戰爭說　中國官方無所聞　除非日軍完全退出　中國決不放下武器</h3>

<p>倫敦　關於馬來代理總督瓊斯所發表英政府現試圖促成中日間和平之廣播演說事、路透社外交訪員頃由負責方面獲得消息、謂現正由倫敦英外部與駐日英大使克萊琪居間與日政府進行談判、並未授權瓊斯對於目前之談判發表言論、（十五日路透社電）</p>
<p>倫敦　此間可靠方面、頃對昨晚新加坡所傳英國政府刻正努力進行結束中日戰事之消息、十分懷疑、緣新加坡行政長官瓊斯、昨晚會發表廣播、謂最近東京英日兩國關於緬甸交通之談判、頗與英國政府企圖恢復中國和平之舉有關、倫敦之英官方、與合衆社記者談話中、僅表示希望事勢之進展、足使英日種種懸案之談判益爲接近、而皆謂並未知悉任何日本對中國之和平建議、經由英國外交人士轉達、至此間中國大使館、亦信重慶國民政府絕未收此類和平提案、此間英國負責方面一再聲明、英國政府、於中日兩國均願英國担仟調人之時、自當出而從事斡旋、但瓊斯之廣播演說、對於事實、似乎言之太過、須知大英帝國、係由倫敦統治而非由新加坡也、英國對中日戰爭所抱持之地位、權威方面會對合衆社記者爲下列之四種解釋、（一）英國唯希望於進一步之討論中、使英日種種懸案、獲得解決、（二）英國旣有事於歐洲、自難單獨採取强硬立塲、以應付日本在華之行動、（三）德國顯然盼望英日發生爭端、此點英國不能不防、（四）英國允許禁止經由緬甸公路輸運軍火、不能認爲係予中國之打擊、因禁運僅限於雨季之三個月中、斯時之運輸數額、實際不過其他時際運輸額之十分之一、官方並稱、僅僅緬甸公路之事、自不能使其成爲造成英日戰爭之口實、（十五日合衆社電）</p>
<p>新加坡　馬來代理總督瓊斯昨晚發表廣播演說、曾透露政府促成中日間和平之努力、據稱英日兩政府現正討論日方所提出關於對華戰事之若干提議、英政府相信中日兩國人民之眞正願望皆爲光榮之和平、故將儘其力量以避免助長並延長東方之戰事、並將作種種可能之努力以終止之、結果如何不久卽可分曉、英國在此次單力應敵之戰爭中、不得不作種種努力及一切犧牲、以期對德獲得最後勝利、蓋此項勝利為挽救文明唯一之希望、英國將儘其所有一切以應付此有史以來最凶殘之戰爭、英國目擊中國與日本（為英帝國昔日之同盟）以兵戎相見、殊覺痛心、英政府熱望或能使此兩大民族間之意見、儘早獲得可能之解決、倘使此項和平努力果遭失敗、則英國及英帝國所抱擊　全世界敵人（卽希特勒所統治之德國）之宗旨、亦決不因之而分心、英國欲求獲勝此項戰爭、自必須集中一切於奮鬥、卽使暫時犧牲其心中所抱之許多意志、亦所不恤云、（十五日路透電）</p>
<p>陶德曼返渝傳亦圖調停</p>
<p>香港　據重慶傳來消息、過去二年中留居本國之德駐華大後陶德曼博士、頃已返抵重慶、謀結束「中國事變」、使日本可成德國之同盟、且能伸其自由之手攫取歐洲各國在遠東之屬地、據傳德向日所提條件有三、（一）日不得占領越南、（二）日應在目下攻英閃電戰尙未發動時參戰、（三）日海軍應集中於東京灣、俾可向馬來半島或荷屬東印突擊、此間消息靈通之外國人士、對於上項傳聞、旣不能證實、亦不吾認、惟此間謠傳希特勒方以壓力加諸重慶與東京、圖結束中國境內之戰事、而使日本不受牽制、與英國在遠東對敵一節、則已歷若干時日、現方不遺餘力以防衛香港之各當局、認爲此事頗有實現之可能、政府發言人某君、於解釋英婦孺何故目香港撒退時、亦曾提及日本助德作戰之問題、又據其他方面之消息、謂日本雖派其前外相至柏林、圖與德國結好、但未必有何結果、德方對於遠東各屬地欲獨自處置、不容日本過問、且上次大戰時、日奪靑島之舉、德人固未嘗或忘也、至於結束中國境內戰事一節、除德方之努力外、聞尙有燕京大學校長司徒雷登博士亦在調停、今年三四月間、彼曾在重慶勾留、傳卽爲此事、司徒博士在華北深受日軍之敬重、重慶政府對之亦頗信仰、而美國駐華外交人員、與彼亦保持密切之聯絡、據傳彼曾向重慶方面提出議和之基本原則、卽恢復七七事變前之原狀、而重慶方面則要求恢復九一八事變前之原狀、結果仍爲僵局、此間有能力之觀察家、一致以爲日本若不爲中日戰事所牽制、則對荷屬東印馬來半島以及越南、恐早已取更嚴峻之手段、倘日本能立卽結束其對華戰事、則猶可及時一圖也、（十五日國際社電）</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>英國斡旋中日的傳說</h3>
<p>昨傳英國駐新加坡總督瓊斯氏廣播稱：英國正在作最懇切的努力，以促成中日間和平。氏關於英國如何努力，並無詳細說明，但謂「英國政府對於贊助及延長遠東戰事之舉，決意盡力避免，並決意盡力達此目的；至結果如何，吾人不久即可知悉。倘此事有獲得雙方均可接受的解決辦法之可能，則自爲一可喜之事；倘若此次努力失敗，則世人當知英國目前最大的目標，在於擊敗德國，決不因任何其他事實而轉移其注意與目的」云。瓊斯氏又說明目前東京英日間關於滇緬路運輸問題的談判，實與英國的力謀終止中日戰爭有關；最後並謂「中日過去均爲英國的好友，英國政府切望早日促進中日爭端之可能的解決」。無論新加坡總督是否如此廣播，但是否們得肯定這一電訉，殆將英國若干人士的心事，婉轉宣洩了。</p>
<p>在這一電訉裏，說明英國若干人士在目前對德作戰期間，除了對付德國之外，對於遠東方面的利與害，乃至關於遠東方面的是非曲直，不遑顧問；并且暗示但求有利於他的對付德國，此外惟有不得已而不顧一切。這一電訉，似乎又表示滇緬公路的通運與吾，竟然有關中日戰爭的持續與吾；而現在的英國若干人士，則不願中日賡續戰爭。</p>
<p>假定英國人士的心事，確如前述的觀察，則有兩種甚可驚異的事情，其一，英國雖非甘願退出遠東，且亦甚願由斡旋中日和平而保持他的遠東地位與權益；然爲對德作戰計，充極其量，即使退出遠東，在所不恤。電傳瓊斯氏所謂英國決不因任何其他事實而轉移其對德作戰的最大目標，眞是對於遠東『極寬厚而偉大』的表示啊！其二，滇緬公路的通運，雖在中國認爲具有要求維持的權利，但並不以此爲抗戰的命脈所關，然在英國若干人士的心目中，估量滇緬路的價値太高了，竟然以這一條闊不過三五丈，載重不過數噸的曲折羊腸，崎嶇山道，他的運輸給養，視爲可以維持綿延五千里的戰綫。若不如此估量錯誤，何以不辭從旁恫嚇的嫌疑而謂東京關於滇緬公路的談判，意在力謀終止中日戰爭？</p>
<p>英國若干人士現在所予吾們的驚異，也可以說是並非空前的。他們現在對於滇緬路估量錯誤，他們往年嘗有更大的錯誤；即是對於日本侵略中國的意義，沒有準確估量，故西門拒却了史汀生氏的合作。前後比較，大可不必驚異吧！英國前任首相張伯倫的『綏靖第一』主義之下，不顧一切，在慕尼黑捺了手印；現任首相邱吉爾氏的『對德第一』主義之下，安知又不顧一切，而在東京談判。當時的慕尼黑妥協，英國自己犧牲了國際道義，又犧牲了捷克，而其後果，則爲英國喪失了一切與國，現在孤軍應戰；現在的東京談判，英國若再犧牲了自己的國際道義而慷他人之慨，則其後果，當為英國在遠東信譽墮地，而終於退出遠東。彼此比較，大可不必驚異吧！</p>
<p>至於英國若干人所欲努力的斡旋中日和平，姑且假定英國不僅為了他自己的對德作戰，同時在他主觀上是認中日兩國是他好友而出諸好意；然客觀所得，絕不如此。蓋日本到現在為止，既沒有尊重中國主權領土行政獨立完整的省覺，中國方面詎有接受斡旋的餘地；不特如此，英國式的斡旋，旣有使日本侵略氣燄更加高張的可能，復予日本以在國際外交上操縱於英德兩間更爲廣大的機會。這不是激越之談！但看關於滇緬公路通運問題中，日本駐英大使所謂英國若不接受日本政府的要求，則東京親德的激烈分子將抬頭；這不是意在操縱英德間的自白嗎？再看日本要求英國堵塞滇緬公路的論據，在於阻止各國對於中國國民政府的援助，以便早日結束所謂中國事變；這不是意在完成武力侵略的鐵證嗎？我們可以看透中國政府與人民，在保持主權領土行政的獨立完整之外，絕無他求，在這前提之下，決不謝絕一切；凡能完成這前提，且歡迎一切；故英國假定有何好意，中國政府人民當無成見，但前提不立，則必一事無成！英國方面乃至任何方面，若不能把握這前提，則必歸於徒費心機！</p>

<p>就種種現象觀之、此次戰局將歴時頗久、且亦艱苦、無人能知戰禍蔓延之所及、惟有一事可斷言者、歐洲人民決不致久受納粹殘酷治權、而世界亦決不致屈服於希特勒之統治、今吾人獨自應付艱局、吾人信任真宰、自信其志不撓、准備衛我疆土以樂侵略、吾人雖獨自作戰、然吾人非僅爲自己作戰、在此難民　集爲人類進步與文明所寄及海上有軍艦梭巡、天空有飛機掩護之地、吾人現待敵方之來攻、毫無惶恐　敵方來攻或見諸今夜、或待至下星期、或從不實現、吾人必須表示有應付焂然猛攻或長期奮鬥之能力、惟無論戰爭久晳、吾人決不諜和、亦決不容談判、吾人固可示恩、但決不乞恩、大西洋外之同情旁觀者、與歐洲未被禍諸國之友人、不能深知吾人之貨源與決心者、因見許多國家不出數星期或數日即爲納粹武力所擊破、遂對英國之生存有所惶慮、但須知希特勒尚未遇有志願力極堅之大國、其前所擊破之諸國、多在被暴力打倒以前已中陰謀諜之毒、先已內腐而後外受打擊、苟不然者、則法國與其陸軍人民、及首腦所遭遇者又將如何解釋乎、至於吾國則健全無恙、希特勒以科學的精細、籌備滅其鄰邦之計畫、對於波蘭挪威丹麥荷蘭比利時一一如法泡制、即法國亦爲其摧毁、吾人由此可知希特勒對於其心目中視爲主要敵國之英國、殆亦籌畫經年、擬有毁滅英國之計盡、今余所可言者、希特勒兩年半所擬之任何侵英方略、現勢必完全改造以應付吾人新地位、　兩月前、吾人首先最努力者、在以最精銳陸軍與所有軍火置於法境、而吾人大部分空軍亦不得不遣往法國備戰、但今則此等兵力悉在國內也、今夜屹立守衛英島之軍隊、其員額之眾、配備之擾、俱非上次或此次戰爭中所前有、今日吾人有一百五十萬人持戈以待、而在六七兩月間每週輙見其編制、防務及打擊力、皆大有進步、在至短時間內、忽有此豆大轉變、吾人對於軍民實不勝譽揚、正規軍後、有擊毁傘兵與空襲者及清除內奸之工具、余不信國內有許多內奸、苟有之其人適自斃耳、正規軍後吾人尚有防務志願兵逾百萬人、其將士多係曾參加上次戰役者、極欲在敵人出現之處予以重創、如敵方果侵入英國、則人民決不消極的放下武裝對敵屈服如他國所爲者、各村各鎮各城吾人將防樂之、而倫敦民眾、亦將不斷的巷戰、不難氣呑全部敵軍、吾人　見倫敦化爲灰燼而不願使倫敦以馴服卑怯之狀態、受人支配如奴隸然、舍不得不陳說此事、因有以吾人意旨曉諭國人而使之安心之要也、</p>
<p>英國空軍　功績卓著</p>
<p>本星期爲英空軍功績卓著之一週、擾亂海峽中護航隊之德機、其所擊落者與英機喪失之數相較、爲五與一之比、此僅爲將來更大戰事之起點、吾人雖尚希望將來成績可視此更佳、然目前有此成績、殊堪自慰、英海軍有武裝軍艦千艘者、遊弋各海、權威遠佈、能迅速保護受威脅之任何區域且能維護英國對新世界之交通、而新世界對英之接濟、現隨戰局而增多、敵方潛艇與飛機對我商業加以無限制之攻擊、今逾十月、然我國食物之存積現視前爲多、而我國般隻噸數、現較初開戰時爲高、此非大可異者乎、惟吾人之努力不因此而稍懈、吾人且必須加倍勉力、不獨籌備夏季、並須准備冬季、不獨爲一九四一年籌備、並須籌及一九四二年、届時余希望戰局將有異於吾人目前所不得不採的攻擊之形式矣、</p>
<p>准備作戰　達於極度</p>
<p>余所以詳述吾火力量之元素與吾人動員及統制之資源者、因欲表示吾人作戰理直、可獲生存工具、吾人今在黑暗時期中慘澹經營、終將見曙光也、余爲代表全國各黨各階級的政府之首腦、受自由國會與自由報紙之贊助、有一點爲吾人團結一致者、即吾人准備作戰達於極度是已、國家之所保持其自由而支持其主義者、唯賴此耳、尚望世界各處之英國民族及與吾人同志對吾人表示好感者、可出其力、捨其所有、堅持到底、此非部落酋長或王氏或朝代之爭、且爲無名英雄戰爭、儘有忠質盡職而其名不彰其行不録者、吾人宜各本其信念盡其職責、庶希特勒之毒燄、終可在吾人時代中銷滅、（十五日路透電）</p>

<p>滬防航綫復航後、因經越運往內地貨物暫停啟運、故由滬赴海防各輪貨物全無、茲據某旅行社近接滇越路各種消息甚詳、今摘要錄後、</p>
<p>快車停駛</p>
<p>滇越鐵路滇段河口迤北三十四公哩馬街車站附橋樑損壞、至今尙未修復、故米許林快車仍暫停行駛、慢車照常通行、惟車至損壞橋樑處、旅客下車過渡、行李過駁、</p>

<p>裝貨延遲今午出口</p>
<p>該郵船原定昨晚十一時、離滬出口返美、因貨物甚多、裝卸費時、現改今午十一時半啟椗、末决送客小輪今晨十時正由新關碼頭開、又該公司世界班郵船亞丹士總統號、原定今日由美經日本來滬、因前日海面颶風、該輪略爲延遲、改明日（十七日）中午抵滬、停泊十二十三號浮筒、聞該郵船此次儎來乘客三十八人、過滬赴南洋及週遊世界者六十人、接客小輪、於明午十一時半自新關碼頭開往、的下午一時儎客回至新關碼頭登陸、該郵船定十九日晨一時四十五分（卽十八日午夜）起程出口赴香港、經小呂宋南洋各埠、由孟買轉道好望角回返紐約、送客末次十九日晨十二時一刻（卽十八日午夜）自新關碼頭開往、</p>

<p>晨市買風仍旺</p>
<p>晨初以滙兌英對美不動、對滬亦平、對法無市、美對英跌半分、對滬不動、對法無市、中央掛牌各滙如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金三辦士八九〇六二五、美滙五元九六八七五、較之上週六收市、英美兩匯俱平、開後洋行首有吃胃、市面已現軟態、計有利及其他外行塞予洋行七月份英金三辦士八四三七五、又八月份英金三辦士八一二五、匯豐掛牌揭曉無更動、白銀平衡稅揭曉亦無增减、此後華行及投機商結納近遠期美匯、價仍吿緊、現美匯且曾到達五元八四三七五、而華行及投機商入美行外行及國外頭寸等七月份美匯五元九三七五及八七五、八月份美滙五元八一二五、嗣以日行來市吐售、匯豐亦懷供意、市象轉鬆、並盛傳和平空氣、人心略受影響、華行忽傾向賣出、計日行沽予外行七月份美滙五元九〇六二五與九三七五、滙豐塞予上海同月美匯五元九〇六二五、後華行吐出同月美匯硬至五元九三七五及九六八七五、收盤趨勢亦鬆、英金三辦士九〇六二五、英滙五元九六八七五、比晨開英微長〇一五六二五、美則無榮辱、</p>
<p>投機轉賣頓湧</p>
<p>午後情况尙靜、惟因投機商拋售、市價見長、美匯已出六元關外、計外行進投機商本月份美匯做六元〇三一二五、後交易亦少、缺乏變化、結果英金三辦士九〇六二五、美匯六元、本月份與現貨同價八月份英金三辦士八四三七五、美匯五元九三七五、較上週末收、現貨英長〇一五六二五、美硬〇六二五、八月份英平、美鬆〇三一二五、</p>

<h3>和平空氣　金市挫折尙微</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤、漲後卒反撳跌、人心不穩、跟風買賣爲多、晨初之猛跳、曾由五千五百元開盤、漲達五千五百六十元、乃匯市報緊、嗣有英德均將斡旋中日和平空氣、又囂塵於市、心虛者不少轉售、而外匯亦隨卽吿硬、時某金號塞出最夥、降至五千三百八十元、午收僅五千三百九十五元、後市爲狀愈疲、五千三百九十元開後、經散戶及銀號幫力賣、再落達五千三百五十元、惟收盤前金號空頭抵補、拉起六七十元、終以五千三百八十元收市、較上週六收軋跌三十元、全日成交尙旺、約三千兩左右、銀樓飾金終則掛低十元、海關金等仍平、</p>
<p>烚赤跌落卅元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初以外匯頗緊、人心堅奮、開市卽狂抬八十五元、金號進銀號二十兩、爲五千五百元、嗣雖銀號稍吐、曾微挫十元、終因外匯斯時依然報軟、銀號帮傾向補空、及新多購買、未久又哄起數十元、銀號進錢兌業二十兩、升爲五千五百六十元、而此後買戶驟减、某金號猛烈拋出、且散多見景脫手、遂回落一百元、銀號出金號十兩、退爲五千四百六十元、旋賴證券幫稍有扒入、且其時錢兌業吃胃亦佳、重又回升五十元、金號對做二十兩、爲五千五百十元、顧以外匯仍走鬆勢某金號一再猛塞、且市上有某種利空消息、是以再引起散多吐出、未久重見回小一百三十元、銀號出金號三十兩、爲五千三百八十元、繼後銀號出銀樓十兩、爲五千三百九十五元、作午收價、午後初時景况仍劣、開市略撳五元、為五千三百八十元、後以銀號及散多吐出、再見做小四十元、銀號出錢兌錢三十兩、　為五千三百五十元、入後某金號補空殊力、拉起七十元、某金號進銀號三十兩、為五千四百二十元、收盤前因某錢兌業復來吐出、再吿不支、銀號互做三十兩、爲五千三百八十元作晚收價、結果比上日軋小三十元、全天二百十元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價照烚赤較高十數元、收進减低三十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十餘元均鮮做開</p>
<p>飾金掛小十元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、初時大同行仍懸五百六十地兇、迨十時掛高十元、十時牛回小十元、十二時三十五分反小十元、此後無變化、結果軋小十元、計大同行改懸五百五十元、新同行與上價相同、收進减低三十元光景、</p>
<h3>外幣兎起鶻落</h3>
<p>了昨日外幣市况、烚赤漲後突跌、英美金鎊因亦先漲後跌、卒吿各跌一元、英金票供求均勻、市價站平、美金票始曾高至十七元零七分、嗣忽又傳關於中日和平之流言復起、人心不無刺激、以致各方供給奇殷、午間退爲十六元六角、午後又曾高至十六元七角二分、終又退爲十六元五角牛、比上週六軋跌二角、香港票則因港滬匯兌趨漲、需要尙殷、晚市升爲三元七角七分、比上週六軋漲二分、坎拿大票及菲列濱票均不乏供給、市價一致趨疲、日余票及朝鮮票需要奇殷、市價一致挺漲、前者高至一元二角四分、後者升至一元零五厘、</p>
<h3>證券謠傳利於多　內債午後激漲</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨日午後、突起漲風、市上謠傳又有和平空氣、幷有英國放棄遠東之說、並見之夜報、雖未免傳之過早、但金價因之轉跌、公債因之驟高、可見金子多頭太多、公債空頭太多、迨公債行市抬高後、又招來多頭出籠、市價仍有恍惚不定之象、市况如無其他意外襲擊、現價或可暫時立定、昨日上午交易平平、大豐及二十二號買進、怡泰及十六號賣出、市價幾毫無上落、午後謠言突起、激起一般浮空抵補、甲種穿出六十二元、乙種穿出三元、丙種衝出一元、市價頗稱良好、中間因多方一度出籠、回小二角左右、不久仍行抬上、各幫買氣驟濃、大豐繼續買進、協大仁昌順亨樂茂及十一號皆有相當收回、十六號繼續賣出、聯和鴻大同順同康均有出脫、市價低而復高、因散戶進胃亦甚踴躍也、一日結果、一律上漲、計二角至五角半不等？成交總數共計九十餘萬元，茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交綢業銀行股二百股價爲二十四元五角、</p>
<p>衆業公所昨日股市開盤、適如一般人之意料、趨勢極端堅昂、起初一小時內、買風大熾、行市單中所列股票、幾於照單全漲、甚至有較上星期伍收盤價漲逾百分之二十者、移時獲利了結之風突起、賣方大半饜於上週購進而解現、收貨確信有上漲把握之經營者、所傳消息、則猶紛歧、收盤時之回軟理由無從確說、全日之交易絕端龐大、市况動態、在回跌時、卽有買戶湧現、故此種曇花一現之蓬勃漲風、是否已至盡頭、此刻甚難斷言、</p>
<h3>糧食　洋米續到五萬餘包　西貢一號進六十元關　比最高時小去八九元</h3>
<p>米市自週前一度稍高回平後、昨又呈暴跌之風、誠以大批途貨洋米陸續湧到、致人心一蹶不振、內地鄉莊去路停頓、本街店胃買氣亦衰、早市一霎那間各色洋米價卽落元外、此後再接再厲一路直瀉、未稍轉色、結果收盤一號陳西貢已跌進六十元大關、祗五十八元半、二號五十六元、五十五元半、一號暹羅五十八元、二號五十五元六角、五十五元、火絞五十七元、五十六元半、香港尖五十六元半至五十五元四角、小絞五十六元、五十五元半、東京砶尖五十一元半、次之四十九元半、碎尖特自四十二元半、次至類栖三十八元、米菉四十五六元、較之週前收價又跌二元有奇、期米方面、並為廿號廿六號所裝之路貨亦在日上可到、因此申請市開價後、行情立隨賣聲熱鬧中下瀉、尤以路貨貶價爲最、六月廿六裝開價六十七元、已比上週六小一元半、繼自六十五元半至六十五元、已到卽交則有六十四元半之喊聲、廿裝開六十五元一角、均比上週六慘落三元四五角鉅、現洋米早市雖有散化、然轉口與內地旣遭阻運、再加平糶卽日開辦、市價亦跟人心虛弱實消呆滯中降落二元、現消祗三千包、路貨三百噸、</p>
<p>洋米昨日又有大量到滬、怡和洋行明生輪、自海防裝來四千包、香港裝來一萬五千八百六十三包、停靠羅斯福碼頭起卸、太古公司重慶輪、由香港運來一萬七千一百四十二包、又濟南輪亦自香港裝來一萬九千一百八十三包、兩輪均停浦東本行碼頭起卸、昨日一日共到洋米五萬六千一百八十八包、</p>
<p>糯米到貨雖乏、但局衰頹、銷塲並滯、致貨主亦無扳守之志、售價遂皆降低二元之砠、開金溧特元六十四元大市六十三元出另、常丹白元六十一二元、香港白元六十三四元、</p>
<p>厚薄粳等國米來源有限、僅六七百包、何如洋米一再甩落、塲外暗盤交易傳聞、遂皆披靡、做開既寥、價亦續貶一二元不等、常幫特　粳已進七十元大關、祗六十八九元、蘇崑常州白粳高自六十六七元次至宿六十四五元、靑泗薄稻六十七八元、南港早稻六十五六元、决至六十三四元云、</p>
<h3>華粉廠盤加價　每包開十六元</h3>
<p>麵粉　昨日華粉廠福新·阜豐等廠、業已恢復開車、照常供應、惟二號粉廠盤、則已漲爲十六元、比前陡漲八角、醞釀多日之華廠粉、結果以加價爲終點、而廠盤旣達十六元、本街之實銷、亦未必旺暢、竟造成洋粉傾銷之機會、聞木客方面、續購洋砲台及人馬等脾洋粉共一萬餘包、價美金三元七角、合包亦與華粉相埒、其品質較爲優良、故購者莫不樂購也、至其他日廠粉與內地粉價均平疲、成交亦有三四千包云、</p>
<p>小麥　昨新小麥來源、約有一萬包左右、均在虹口起卸、除一部份直接配與日廠外、華廠方面亦有零批購進、其價則較日廠爲高、因目下環境關係、華廠非放價不易購得、聞福阜兩廠進價爲二十三元半至二十四元、而市塲交易、迄無正式做開</p>
<h3>糖市　冰箱花靑見新高價</h3>
<p>昨糖市趨勢平定、公會劃盤二四粗白本棧六十八元一角至六十八元、無甚上落、外棧貨未成交、轉口貨現打棧單五十三元六角、升三角、二十二日交貨初升六角、爲五十四元二角、後仍回至五十三元六角、太古車白B嘜西棧七十八元、東棧七十七元半、荷赤五十八元、香港帮前到冰花靑一百包、曾叫七十五元未成、昨以七十三元開出、亦新紀錄也、前日（十四）有太古車糖三千一百二十五包自香港運來、</p>
<h3>紗花　中日紗　俏疲不同</h3>
<p>紗市平穩、趨勢安定、而漲風微現、此因華南一帶、對於粗細紗需求依然繼續不懈、因此多頭意態鎭靜、且有一部份均抱逢高賣、遇低則進、所以局勢寗靜、惟日紗仍在疲境而無力上升、不過情形不同、一則香港幫銷胃暢健、一則去路狹隘也、</p>
<p>現紗晨開市象甚平、　　　支雙馬開價爲一千零二十元、跌至十八元、此價盤旋甚久、旋聞廣幫採辦、尙屬殷切、人心振作、塲中買者興趣稍濃、漲至一千零三十元收盤、查半日問成交統計一千八百二十五包、行悄二十支雙馬漲十九元、昨日有棉紗六十件遝厦門、茲將各幫口買去之額量、分列如左、</p>
<p>同行　八三〇　香港　八一〇　寗波　一三五　內地　五　廈門　四五　統計　一·八二五</p>
<h3>華廠開始採辦棉市轉機</h3>
<p>現棉交易稍見活絡、氣勢較昂一步、但日廠舉動殊鮮、仍無採辦之象、惟華廠及同行中納胃轉健、故市面良好一些、茲將現棉成交情形錄左、</p>
<p>阿根廷二二八·〇〇　申二廠進　三〇件</p>
<p>米特林二八〇·〇〇　新裕進一〇〇件</p>
<p>通州一七二·〇〇　同行　進二〇〇包</p>
<p>通州　一七五·〇〇　慶祥　進二〇〇包</p>
<p>另訊外棉市價、紐約棉市、昨日市况殊為靜寂、後因現貨商之賣出、及一部份多頭了結、結果收盤價格、近期漲四五磅音、遠期稍跌一二磅音、印度市况殊為堅定、昨日連同預測又漲四五羅比、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、日來已日形熱鬧、華廠方面亦已開始採購、同業問心思亦殊興奮、成交者頗衆、市上存底日見稀少、故各方俱認棉價之將步漲也、</p>
<h3>雜糧　豆餅得雨大漲</h3>
<p>昨日豆餅市况、因隔晚曾得陣雨、一般投機餅商復活、各方辦胃因之而起、行市陡升、結果靑中餅漲風獨健、比上週末猛提一元二角、其他各餅均驟升六七角不等、計興化泉州汕頭內地行囤等做開大有餘四牌廠餅一萬五千片、價為十三元二角、甡記餅三千片、價為十二元、靑中餅四千片、價自十元零七角至十一元一角、元隆餅二車、價爲十一元七角、肥字餅二車、價爲十一元六七角、昌記餅一千片、價爲十一元三角云、</p>

<p>東布　市盤續昂、蓋以本街染銷、昨起稍形活動、成交中擋各牌細布五百餘包、提升每疋二角半、龍頭細布亦續呈堅穩之象、自三十元〇一二角起至後市收盤爲三十元〇七角半、四君子嗶嘰每碼售開九角〇七五、</p>
<p>進出口　前日（十四）有疋頭一百二十件運香港、今日有五十五件運厦門、六件運新加坡、</p>
<h3>煤炭烟煤屑去路暢</h3>
<p>烟屑市塲、自淡銷削價以來、市面漸見轉機、引起街客辦胃、行情微呈硬化、計做同業拆價、開平一號屑每噸一百九十元、二號屑一百七十元、基隆屑一百五十元、以上均棧房自出棧單、送到客戶、酌加盤子、</p>
<h3>絲茶　日絲回升　本市絲交僵持</h3>

<h3>耶穌是全世界的救主</h3>
<p>耶穌基督降生，是要建立天國，使世界大同，人類互助，國與國的疆界，種族及階級的障礙，永遠棄除，使人類為手足，天下為一家，干戈化玉帛，所以耶穌實在是全世界的救主。在這無時不有風潮的世界歷史中，人類屢次想改造世界，解決糾紛，維持秩序，以求達到黃金時代；無奈自救的方法已經屢次失敗了！那高尚的文明和驚人的科學，反而增加人類的痛苦；個人的，國家的，和國際的種種不法行為，在處可見；疾病死亡，常與同在；人生各種事業，無論經濟社會道德宗教，都已產生了非我們所能解決的大問題；仇視犯忌和報復，循環不息；而積尸成山血流成河的慘酷戰爭，終不能避免。上主早已知道人類不能自求，所以差遣祂的兒子（耶穌）來，可惜世人不肯接待祂。耶穌是「和平的君」，並且「祂的政權與平安，必增加無窮」。祂來要「擦去他們一切的眼淚，不再有死亡，也不再有悲哀號哭疼痛」。惟有祂是「萬王之王，萬主之主」；世界的希望。從前敘加人為耶穌做見證說：『我們親自聽見了，知道這真是救世主』！</p>
<p>當時猶太巡撫彼拉多，拿了一塊牌子，用三國文字——希伯來希利尼羅馬，寫了一個名號，安在要釘殺耶穌的十字架上。寫的是：「猶太人的王拿撒勒人耶穌」。這不是彼拉多這樣寫，其實是上主在暗中指示，明明向全世界公佈那釘在十字架上的耶穌，是猶太人的王，歷代所盼望的彌賽亞，世界唯一的大救主。他特意用三國的文字，使人人都知道其中的用意非常奧秘；希伯來的特點是宗教，希利尼是文化，羅馬是政治；表示耶穌就是宗教文化和政治的救主。祂是宗教的王，祂將施行拯救，直到地極。祂是文化的王，凡哲學科學藝術，都因祂而有真美善。祂也是治政的王，因為祂原來是萬有主宰萬王之王，只有祂來世界方能大同，現在我們雖然還沒有看見萬有屈服祂，但是祂已經被高舉在十字架上，必要吸引萬人來歸祂。願我們大家起來歡迎耶穌，只有祂是全世界唯一的救主！</p>

<h3>兒女的痛苦</h3>
<p>— 編者</p>
<p>這是一位讀者的來函：</p>
<p>自由談編輯先生：</p>
<p>在七月十一日的自由談上，看到「給一位想自殺的女子」和「給一個父親」兩篇之後，很使我同情那女子的命運。不禁想到像這樣的家庭實在是太多了。看多少青年子弟，不是入於歧途迷域，就是被困苦得透不過氣來。「人之初，性本善，」可是做父母的，非但不負教育之責，不使子女入於光明道，反而横加毁害？，待子女長大了，再加上一聲「不孝之子」——做子女的也太苦了。這皆是做父母的沒有認清「自己」和「家庭」，既不知做父母，亦不會做父母。</p>
<p>所以我很希望貴刊能發表些關於心理衛生，家庭教育，父母修養之類的文字，促醒人生莫疏忽了家庭教育和子女心理，擔負起做父母的責任，以期减少子女輩的苦惱罷。敬祝</p>
<p>編安　之達敬上</p>
<p>我們願意接受之達先生的建議，在自由談中談些關於家庭教育與心理衛生的問題。因爲這些問題直接對於個人與家庭，間接對於社會舆國家，都有密切的關係。我們覺得探討這些問题，應該從心理學的觀點上來立論，我們歡迎讀者提出問題來，也歡迎讀者的批評與指正。</p>
<p>科學</p>
<h3>原子能的利用</h3>
<p>— 莫名</p>
<p>鈾原子分裂成功是近年來科學界中最重要的新發現，原子能的利用則是當今科學家的最新奇，最美麗的夢想。</p>
<p>原子是「宇宙的磚石」，是構成一切物質的單位微粒，但是這種渺小得不可想像的微粒却也有它自己複雜的搆造。每一個原子的中心有一個核心，四周環繞着猶如「衆星圍拱」的電子　，原予核中又有數量不等的中子和質子．這許多中子和質子都是好動而不安份的傢伙，现在却被一種不可思議的力量把它們緊紧地拘囿在狭窄異常的範圍中。這種力量是十分奥妙而偉大的，但是當有一種猛烈的外力如高速度中子來轟擊原子的核心，而使它分裂時，這種束縛力量之一部就被發放出來，而產生所謂驚人的一原子能。原子的重量愈大，它的核心中拘囿着的粒子愈多，那末在分裂時產生的能量也愈大；鈾正是九十二種化學元素中最重的一種——原子量238。</p>
<p>每一個鈾原子在分裂時發生約近二十萬萬電子伏特的能量。電子伏特是一種物理學上的單位，很難用淺近的語句來解釋或形容它，因此要明瞭「二十萬萬電伏」這個數字的偉大性，我們須用此較的方法：每一個碳原子在燃燒時放出大約四個電伏的能量，而人類的最猛烈炸藥T．N．T每一個分子爆炸時也不過五個電伏。所以我們倘若用煤來代表碳，那末鈾原子產生的動力能就是五百萬倍於同量的煤。難怪科學家夢想要用八磅鈾元素驅送愛麗皇后號横渡大西洋哩！</p>
<p>鈾原子在分裂時也落下若干「碎片」，或者說發射出遊離的中子，這種中子宛如脫覊之馬，勁道極足，當它衝擊着隣近的另一鈾原于時，同樣能使原子核爆裂，再度發放能量，再度發射中子，如是接二連三的循環作用起來，原予能的產生就能自動的維持推進下去。這種科學家稱做「鏈式作用」的现象，真可說是天赐之便，否則在利用原子能時，我們須不斷的將原子核一一加以擊破，不僅不勝其麻煩，抑且爲不經濟之尤．但是問題不祇是如此簡單，原子共有三種，原子量各爲238，235(即所謂同位素)，據試驗結果，三種中只有「鈾235」最適宜於「鏈式作用」。可恨「鈾235」，偏偏是最稀有的一種，在天然的鈾兀素中存在量不到百分之一」因此現在分離凝集這種稀有質素的方法，便成爲科學家研究的焦點。這種研究進行得非常迂緩，艱苦而且費錢，儘管我們由最前進的物理學家，用现代最精良的器械去探求，成績終是悽惨得可憐：每小時只能分離得一百萬萬分之一磅的「鈾235」照此推算我們要積满一磅的原子能燃料非等到一百萬年之後不可，這未免太笑語了。但是據最近從瑞典來的消息，有一位科學家已能用獨特的新方法將分離「鈾235」的速度增加到一萬一千倍以上，由此可見科學進步，一曰千里，目檩雖遥，距離却在一天天縮短之中，最近美固著名的發明家鄧氏（Gano　Dunn）預測原子能的利用將於未來二十年中實現，甚至有在十年內速成的可能，這就是說十廿年中我們世界即將因原子能的利用而大大的改觀，我們姑以興奮的心情，懷滿腔的熱望，拭目以靜待之吧！</p>

<h3>舞后的歸宿</h3>
<p>— 程小青著</p>
<p>第三章　對立的情報</p>
<p>老毛又放低了聲音，答道：「伊在最近的兩星期中，有兩夜住在外面。第一夜——我已記不得日子，大概一禮拜多了罷？——風平浪靜。王小姐在早晨九點鐘回來，當然不會告訴我們伊上夜在那裏過夜。可是我們已猜想到八九分，因爲這趙伯雄正跟伊攪得火一般熱哪。」他舐了舐嘴脣，又用手在額角上抹了一抹。</p>
<p>「可是第二次就不很太平啦。」他繼纜了一句，忽又頓住了。</p>
<p>霍桑催促着說：「怎樣不太平？快說」</p>
<p>老毛忽走近一步，彎了些腰。「這一次險些兒弄僵！那天——我想想看，是大前天十六，禮拜五晚上，伊又一夜沒有回來．到了十七早上八點鐘時，陸經理忽然來了一個電話，聽說王小姐不在，便發起火來。」</p>
<p>霍桑忽止住他道：「慢，這電話誰接的?」</p>
<p>老毛道：「金梅接的。但我在這裏掃地，聽得很清楚。金梅還掉過一個檜花，可是没有用。」</p>
<p>「掉過槍花？什磨搶花？」</p>
<p>「金梅先回答他王小姐還沒有起來。但陸經理逼着要王小姐接談，金梅還假裝上樓去喚叫，停了一回兒，又回答他叫不醒．那陸經理分明更起了疑心，一定要伊接話。金梅給逼得沒法，才不得不說實話，所以這個搶花反而壞事。」</p>
<p>「以後怎麼樣？」</p>
<p>「到了八點一刻光景，陸經理氣忽忽地趕來了，可是王小姐遺沒有回來。害得我們都着急起來，幸虧陸經理沒有上樓，門口又有汽車聲音，王小姐回來了，接着他們俩見了面，他就在這一間裏鬧起來。」</p>
<p>「怎麼樣？你可曾聽得什麼？」</p>
<p>老毛摇了摇頭，「我聽得不很仔細，祇有一句兩句。那陸經理會說什麼「你太對不起我....，一定是這姓趙的流氓......，那天電影院裏我就看出他不是路道」。我聽了這腥句話，肚子裏當然雪亮，陸經理委直不會寃枉伊——」</p>
<h3>兩條盲腸</h3>
<p>— 歐麗</p>
<p>醫生已經睡了，正在好夢方酣的當兒，突然被電話的鈴聲吵醒。打電話的原來是一個熟病人，用急促的聲音主說：「醫生，快來，我的妻子患盲腸炎了。」</p>
<p>醫生歎了一口氣，叫那男人不要胡閙，安然去睡。他說「隨便讓她喝點東西好了，我明天再來看。她沒有盲腸的。」</p>
<p>那丈夫越焦急了，堅持說她也有盲腸。醫生大聲說，「她不會有的，我三年前才把她的盲腸割去，我從來沒有聽見過有兩條盲腸的。」</p>
<p>那丈夫最後才詮：「聽見過有兩位太太的人嗎？」，醫生恍然大悟，趕快出去。幸虧去得早，因爲那第二伏太太真的也有盲腸啦？</p>

<h3>失敗人</h3>
<p>— 華志</p>
<p>美國出版界的热閙，是世界共知的，即以傳記一項而論，每年至少出版五六百種，內容無非是社會上一般知名人物成功事續。但是今年出版的傅記中，除了許多「成功人傳」以外，還有幾種「失敗人傳」，</p>
<p>這却是別開生面的。</p>
<p>因爲自來一個人由奮鬥而得到成功，而錄之於書籍，其中經過若干年代，即成爲劃時代的東西，大抵不能随便模仿；反之，有些人經過種種冒險奮鬥，結果並未成功，其所出失敗的原因，却很有作爲別人借鏡的地方，而圖再接再厲，谚云「不如意事常八九」，失敗者給人的惕勵，有超過成功者所給舆的。</p>
<p>這些「失敗人傳」中，有些是昔年美國經濟衰落時代的實業家金融家，他們现在在社會上都很有地位，但他們並沒有把所以成功的原因說出來，只把他們失敗的秘密，和盤托出而已。</p>

<h3>關於四進士</h3>
<p>— 欽丕</p>
<p>四進士爲羣戲之一，包括生旦凈末丑諸角。演出方面，俱見重要，劇情也相當精彩，它暴露了數百年乃至數千年以來我國司法界頗雞避免的弊情，所謂有財有勢，打官司就不成問題，反之孤弱無助者，終有寃枉，亦難平反，千古以來，不知多少寃魂沉溺海底。</p>
<p>但是平劇的結構却是「團圓」的，四進士也逃不出例外，編劇者描寫宋士杰仗義援救弱女，可謂淋漓盡致，全劇自始至終，抓住了觀衆緊張的情緒！確是一齣不易多得的好戲。</p>
<p>我覺得主角宋士杰的演技是極其艱難的，除做唸唱三者俱須精粹外，演員允要到達相當年齡，始見相當功候；否則雖有佳喉，殊難討好。環觀今日南北梨園行，只馬連良與周信芳堪膺此任，上月連良南下，打泡戲第二夕卽貼四進士，嗣後又連續二次，我因鑒于周信芳的四進士有「龍吟虎嘯」「刻劃入畫」令人百觀不厭的佳技，乃聚精會神，再去領略馬派的作風；馬派的特殊點是多了二段塲子，在柳林寫狀之前，多一段設計謀害，在二次公堂之後，多一段禁監受苦，無論這二段應否添插，不必置論</p>
<p>至於周信芳的四進士，最重「做」字，感人頗深。有人說：信芳的戲是擁有廣大羣衆的，此話固對，但廣大絮衆却要不是資產階級，大多數以勞力換來的錢，苦中作樂，去欣賞眞正藝術，信芳於終年長時期獨當一面演出，迭貼此齣，屢吿滿堂，是誠難能而可貴！謂四進士係麒派至尊無上佳作，這是最公允的評語。</p>

<h3>British Restrictions on Goods Transported to Yunnan-Burma Road: China Lodges Strong Protest with Britain; Northwest Route Transportation Expected to Become More Frequent; China and Soviet Union Relations Becoming Closer</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Due to Japanese demands, the British government has decided to modify the passage of certain goods through Burma into China for a specific period. Upon receiving this information, the Chinese government has lodged its strongest protest with the British government. (Fifteenth dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Reliable sources indicate that China has lodged a strong protest with Britain regarding the Burma Road blockade, deeming it illegal. However, official circles here do not view the Burma Road blockade as a blow. According to officials, transporting goods via this route is not economical. They stated that after the blockade of the Burma Road, the import and export of goods via the Northwest Route, China's only international lifeline, would become more frequent. Furthermore, relations between China and the Soviet Union would become even closer, as the closeness between China and the Soviet Union is due to the inability of democratic nations to fully aid China. Additionally, the press is criticizing the lack of activity on the part of democratic nations. The Central Daily News harshly criticizes Britain's attitude towards the Burma Road, stating that Britain is bound by the League of Nations' resolution to aid China and is known for sincerely adhering to League of Nations resolutions. It should not engage in such contradictory actions. If Britain allows Japan's demands regarding the Burma Road, the situation will form the first step in Japan's aggression against India and Burma. The newspaper urges Britain not to fall into Japan's trap and points out that acknowledging Japan's demands means losing British prestige. (Fifteenth United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: British military attaché Miller flew to Rangoon yesterday regarding the Burma Road blockade. (Fifteenth United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Britain States the Ban Will Last Three Months</p>
<p>Stockholm: According to London sources, British officials deny that Britain has accepted Japan's demand to halt cargo transport on the Yunnan-Burma Road. British political figures claim it is too early to discuss a British-Japanese agreement. London believes that the issue of cargo transport on the Yunnan-Burma Road is one of the issues in British-Japanese negotiations. If Britain expresses willingness to restrict certain goods passing through Burma, it will only be a temporary measure, and Britain will still be able to act freely in the future. According to "Svenska Dagbladet," British sources state that the temporary restriction will only last for three months, coinciding with the rainy season when transportation on the Yunnan-Burma Road is difficult. London newspapers have not mentioned measures for Britain to allow the Japanese consulate in Rangoon to monitor cargo restrictions. The British government seems unwilling to publish the details of British-Japanese negotiations. (Fifteenth Huitong News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>Stockholm: British radio broadcast last night regarding the negotiations between British Ambassador to Japan Sir Robert Craigie and the Japanese government in recent days, denying foreign reports that Britain had accepted Japan's demand to halt the transport of munitions through Burma and Hong Kong to China. It is claimed that negotiations have not yet concluded. The British government has only agreed to various suggestions and raised some reservations. The Yunnan-Burma cargo transport issue has not yet been finally resolved, and the issue of Yunnan-Burma munitions transport is only one of the issues in the Tokyo negotiations. (Fifteenth Huitong dispatch)</p>
<p>London: The diplomatic correspondent of The Times claims that Washington has sent unofficial criticisms regarding Britain's temporary concessions to Japan on the issue of military equipment transport to China via the Burma Road. It should be noted that these negotiations are still in progress, and American criticisms seem to be based on inaccurate information about the negotiations. Furthermore, responsible London sources point out that these negotiations do not hinder the British government's freedom of action in the future. The British government's temporary ban on the transport of certain goods between Burma and China does not tie the hands of the British government. (Fifteenth Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Craigie-Arita Agreement Details</p>
<p>Tokyo: British Ambassador to Japan Sir Robert Craigie and Japanese Foreign Minister Arita recently finalized the details of the Burma Road blockade agreement during a two-hour discussion. It is reported that Britain is only willing to temporarily halt transportation on the Burma Road, while Japan is insisting on other demands.

<h3>Rumors of British Mediation of the Sino-Japanese War: Chinese Officials Unaware; China Determined Not to Lay Down Arms Unless Japanese Troops Completely Withdraw</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Official circles here are completely unaware of yesterday's broadcast speech by Jones, the Chief Administrator of Singapore. Officials say that China has been resisting for three years and is determined to move towards the final goal. Chairman Chiang has repeatedly declared this point. Any conditions that do not conform to the purpose announced by Chairman Chiang will not be considered by the Chinese government. China will not lay down its arms unless Japanese troops completely withdraw from China. (Fifteenth United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>London: Regarding the broadcast speech by Jones, the Acting Governor of Malaya, that the British government is now trying to promote peace between China and Japan, Reuters' diplomatic correspondent has received information from responsible sources stating that the British Foreign Office in London and British Ambassador to Japan Sir Robert Craigie are currently conducting negotiations with the Japanese government. Jones was not authorized to comment on the current negotiations. (Fifteenth Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>London: Reliable sources here are very skeptical about the news from Singapore last night that the British government is currently working hard to end the Sino-Japanese war. Jones, the Chief Administrator of Singapore, gave a broadcast last night stating that the recent British-Japanese negotiations in Tokyo regarding transportation in Burma are closely related to the British government's efforts to restore peace in China. British officials in London, speaking to United Press reporters, only expressed the hope that developments would bring the negotiations on various British-Japanese issues closer and stated that they were unaware of any Japanese peace proposals to China being conveyed through British diplomats. The Chinese Embassy here also believes that the National Government in Chongqing has not received such peace proposals. Responsible British sources here have repeatedly stated that the British government will naturally mediate if both China and Japan want Britain to assume the role of mediator, but Jones' broadcast speech seems to exaggerate the facts. It must be understood that the British Empire is ruled from London, not Singapore. Authoritative sources have given the following four explanations to United Press reporters regarding Britain's position on the Sino-Japanese war: (1) Britain only hopes to resolve various British-Japanese issues in further discussions. (2) Britain, being preoccupied with Europe, cannot independently take a strong stance to deal with Japan's actions in China. (3) Germany clearly hopes that a dispute will arise between Britain and Japan, and Britain must guard against this. (4) Britain's permission to ban the transport of munitions via the Burma Road should not be considered a blow to China, as the ban is limited to the three months of the rainy season, and the actual amount of transportation at that time is only one-tenth of the amount of transportation at other times. Officials also said that the Burma Road issue alone cannot be used as an excuse to create a British-Japanese war. (Fifteenth United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Singapore: The Acting Governor of Malaya, Jones, revealed in a broadcast speech last night the government's efforts to promote peace between China and Japan. It is claimed that the British and Japanese governments are currently discussing certain proposals made by Japan regarding the war with China. The British government believes that the true desire of the people of both China and Japan is for a glorious peace, so it will do its best to avoid assisting and prolonging the war in the East and will make all possible efforts to end it. The results will soon be clear. In this war where Britain is fighting alone against the enemy, it has to make various efforts and all sacrifices in order to achieve the final victory over Germany, as this victory is the only hope for saving civilization. Britain will do everything possible to cope with this most brutal war in history. Britain is saddened to see China and Japan (former allies of the British Empire) at war with each other. The British government earnestly hopes to find a solution to the opinions between these two great nations as soon as possible. If these peace efforts fail, then the British and the British Empire's goal of defeating the enemies of the whole world (i.e., Germany ruled by Hitler) will not be distracted. Britain must concentrate everything on the struggle in order to win this war, and will not hesitate to temporarily sacrifice many of the wills in its heart. (Fifteenth Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Rumors of Trautmann's Return to Chongqing Also Seeking Mediation</p>
<p>Hong Kong: According to reports from Chongqing, Dr. Trautmann, the German ambassador to China who has been staying in his home country for the past two years, has recently returned to Chongqing to end the "China Incident," so that Japan can become an ally of Germany and be able to freely seize the colonies of European countries in the Far East. It is reported that Germany has made three conditions to Japan: (1) Japan must not occupy Vietnam, (2) Japan should participate in the war before the current German blitzkrieg against Britain has begun, and (3) the Japanese Navy should concentrate in Tokyo Bay so that it can attack the Malay Peninsula or the Dutch East Indies. Well-informed foreign sources here cannot confirm or deny the above rumors. However, rumors here that Hitler is putting pressure on Chongqing and Tokyo to end the war in China so that Japan is not constrained and can oppose Britain in the Far East have been circulating for some time. The authorities who are now sparing no effort to defend Hong Kong believe that this is quite likely to happen. A government spokesman mentioned the issue of Japan assisting Germany in the war when explaining why British women and children were being evacuated from Hong Kong. According to other sources, although Japan has sent its former Foreign Minister to Berlin to try to forge ties with Germany, there may not be any results. Germany wants to deal with the colonies in the Far East on its own and does not allow Japan to interfere. Moreover, the Germans have never forgotten Japan's seizure of Qingdao in the last war. As for ending the war in China, in addition to Germany's efforts, it is reported that Dr. Stuart, the president of Yenching University, is also mediating. He stayed in Chongqing in March and April of this year, reportedly for this matter. Dr. Stuart is highly respected by the Japanese army in North China, and the Chongqing government also has great faith in him. American diplomats in China also maintain close contact with him. It is reported that he has proposed to Chongqing the basic principles of peace talks, namely, restoring the situation before the July 7th Incident, while Chongqing has requested restoring the situation before the September 18th Incident, resulting in a stalemate. Competent observers here unanimously believe that if Japan is not constrained by the Sino-Japanese War, it may have already taken more severe measures against the Dutch East Indies, the Malay Peninsula, and Vietnam. If Japan can immediately end its war with China, it may still be able to do so in time. (Fifteenth International News Agency dispatch)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Rumor of British Mediation Between China and Japan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, it was reported that Mr. Jones, the British Governor of Singapore, broadcast that the UK is making the most sincere efforts to bring about peace between China and Japan. He did not specify how the UK is trying, but he said "The British Government is determined to avoid doing anything to endorse or prolong the war in the Far East and is determined to exert every effort to achieve this end; As to the outcome, we shall soon know. If it is possible to obtain a solution which is acceptable to both sides, that will be a welcome thing; If these efforts fail, the world will know that the UK's greatest goal is to defeat Germany, and shall not divert attention and purpose because of any other fact." Mr. Jones also explained that the current Sino-British talks in Tokyo on the issue of transport in the Yunnan-Burma Road are in fact related to the UK's efforts to end the Sino-Japanese war; He also said that "China and Japan have been good friends of the UK in the past, and the British government earnestly hopes to promote the possible resolution of the Sino-Japanese dispute as soon as possible." Regardless of whether the Governor of Singapore broadcast such a thing, whether we can affirm this telegram is likely to subtly express the thoughts of some British people.</p>
<p>In this telegram, it explains that certain British people in the current period of war against Germany, in addition to dealing with Germany, the profit and harm in the Far East, and even the right and wrong of the Far East, are not bothered to be consulted; and it implies that as long as it is beneficial to his handling of Germany, there is nothing else to worry about. This telegram seems to indicate that the unimpeded transport on the Yunnan-Burma Road is actually related to the continuation of the Sino-Japanese War; and certain British people now do not want China and Japan to continue the war.</p>
<p>Assuming that the thoughts of the British people are indeed as described above, there are two very surprising things. First, although the UK is not willing to withdraw from the Far East, and very much desires to maintain its position and interests in the Far East through mediation of Sino-Japanese peace; however, for the sake of fighting Germany, even if it is necessary to withdraw from the Far East to the greatest extent, there is no objection. The telegram conveyed by Mr. Jones that the UK will never divert its greatest goal of fighting Germany because of any other fact is truly a "very generous and great" expression for the Far East! Second, the transport on the Yunnan-Burma Road, although China believes it has the right to demand its maintenance, does not consider it related to the lifeline of the War of Resistance, but in the minds of certain British people, the value of the Yunnan-Burma Road is overestimated, as it is actually a winding path of no more than three or five feet wide and carrying no more than a few tons. His transportation and supply is regarded as being able to maintain a battlefront stretching for five thousand miles. If such an erroneous estimate is not made, why would there be the suspicion of intimidation from the side and say that Tokyo's negotiations on the Yunnan-Burma Road are intended to strive to end the Sino-Japanese War?</p>
<p>The surprises that certain British people are giving us now can also be said to be not unprecedented. They are now making an erroneous estimate of the Yunnan-Burma Road, and they had even greater errors in the past; that is, they did not accurately estimate the significance of Japan's invasion of China, so Simon rejected Stimson's cooperation. Compared before and after, there is no need to be surprised! Under the "appeasement first" doctrine of former British Prime Minister Chamberlain, he disregarded everything and put his handprint in Munich; under the "Germany First" doctrine of the current Prime Minister Churchill, who knows whether he will disregard everything again and negotiate in Tokyo. At the time of the Munich compromise, Britain sacrificed its own international morality and also sacrificed Czechoslovakia, and the consequences were that Britain lost all its allies and is now fighting alone; if Britain sacrifices its own international morality and makes others generous in the current Tokyo negotiations, then the consequences will be that Britain's credibility in the Far East will fall to the ground, and it will eventually withdraw from the Far East. Compared with each other, there is no need to be surprised!</p>
<p>As for the mediation of Sino-Japanese peace that certain British people want to strive for, let us assume that the UK is doing it not only for its own war against Germany, but also out of good intentions because it subjectively recognizes China and Japan as its friends; However, objectively, it is by no means the case. Because Japan has not yet respected China's sovereignty, territorial, administrative independence, integrity of provincial realization, there is no room for China to accept mediation; not only that, the British style of mediation has the possibility of making Japan's aggressive arrogance even higher, and gives Japan a more extensive opportunity to manipulate between the UK and Germany in international diplomacy. This is not an excited statement! But looking at the issue of the transport of the Yunnan-Burma Road, Japan's ambassador to the UK said that if the UK does not accept the demands of the Japanese government, then the radical elements pro-German in Tokyo will rise to the top; isn't this a confession that is intended to manipulate between the UK and Germany? Looking at the argument that Japan requires the UK to block the Yunnan-Burma Road is to prevent all countries from assisting the National Government of China, so as to end the so-called China Incident as soon as possible; isn't this conclusive evidence of the intention to complete military aggression? We can see through that the Chinese government and people, in maintaining the independence and integrity of sovereignty, territory, and administration, have nothing else to ask for, and under this premise, they will never refuse everything; whoever can complete this premise, and welcomes everything; Therefore, if the UK assumes that there is any goodwill, the Chinese government and people should have no prejudice, but if the premise is not established, then nothing will be accomplished! If the UK, or any party, cannot grasp this premise, then it will inevitably lead to wasting effort!</p>

<h3>Two Pieces of Zhang Zizhong's Testament Encouraging Subordinates to Sacrifice for the Country</h3>
<p>Fancheng: General Commander Zhang Zizhong, in recent years, has defended the country and resisted foreign aggression in the Ezhong area, repeatedly thwarting the enemy's advance and achieving extraordinary feats. Last year, he annihilated over ten thousand Japanese soldiers on the Jingzhong Road. In the recent Henan-Hubei campaign, he personally led his troops, fiercely attacking the Japanese army between Hongshan, Zaoyang, and the Han River, for over half a month, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy. On May 16th, Zhang led a portion of a certain division in pursuit of the retreating Japanese army. During the heat of battle, in close combat, many subordinates advised him to withdraw, but Zhang refused, still personally leading his troops in a charge. Unexpectedly, the Japanese took him from behind, causing Zhang to fall into the enemy's ranks. Nevertheless, he engaged in bloody hand-to-hand combat with the Japanese, killing countless numbers. Unfortunately, he was struck by a bullet in a vital area, and valiantly sacrificed himself at Nanguadian, near Zhangjiaji, on the western foothills of Dabie Mountain. After his death, there was a torrential downpour, as if the heavens were mourning. Before leading his troops to attack the Japanese on May 8th, Zhang had personally written to a certain deputy commander, including a long letter encouraging his subordinates, his determination to sacrifice for the country, and absolute obedience to the leader's commands, filling every line. Now, having obtained the original text of the two letters, they are transcribed as follows:</p>
<p>A letter to a certain commander states: "Tong Linge and Zhao Dengyu died in Nanyuan, and Song Zheyuan also died in Sichuan. Only you, me, Liu Ruming, Shi Yousan, and a few others remain. We do not know when we too will part forever. We should immediately make a decision, before we die, to exert our greatest efforts for the country and the nation, never stopping until death. In this way, even if we meet in the underworld after death, we will surely be joyous and encouraged, without any shame."</p>
<p>A letter to his subordinates states: "Regarding the matter at hand, you and I have two paths to take. The first is to be perfunctory, everyone being perfunctory, everything being perfunctory. I am perfunctory towards you, and you are perfunctory towards your subordinates. Before the enemy comes, we arrange defenses in a perfunctory manner. When the Japanese come, we resist in a perfunctory manner. We retreat after a perfunctory effort. This approach may seem clever, but it is actually the most foolish. It may seem easy, but it is actually more difficult. It may seem cheap, but it is actually more costly. Because if we don't fight today, we will still have to fight tomorrow. If we don't fight in the front, we will still have to fight wherever we retreat. The sacrifice will be the same, but we will only earn the disapproval of our superiors. Therefore, the result of this path will inevitably be disgrace and ruin. Not only will the country be ruined at our hands, but the lives of future generations will also be forfeited by us. This is equivalent to suicide, so this path is a dead end, a path of decline and destruction. You and I have shared life and death, shared hardships for more than a decade, our bond stronger than flesh and blood, our loyalty heavier than brotherhood. I cannot bear to let you take this path of destruction. You have always understood the greater good, understood the greater righteousness, and I believe you will certainly not take this path. We only have one other path to take, which is to fight. Since we have been ordered to defend this line, we are determined to fight on this line. Rather than retreating and still having to fight, we might as well fight on this line with value and meaning. This time, we must fight the Japanese to the end on this line, finishing the fight, and not retreating without orders. You and I have been supported by the country for decades. No matter how difficult, can we not fight? Fortunately, if our fight can stop the Japanese, then not only a few of us, but our entire army will surely enjoy supreme glory in the Republic of China. Our officers and soldiers will forever maintain a glorious position. In the unlikely event that we fight to the end, you and I will still be worthy of the country, worthy of the 400 million compatriots, fathers, and elders. We will not have betrayed their support, and we will not be ashamed to be soldiers for life. Therefore, this path is a path of integrity, the only path we should take. You and I have endured countless hardships since joining the war of resistance. Now we have reached the final stage. 'Building a mountain, piling nine loads of earth, how can we bear to fall short by one basket?' Therefore, I can only hope that you will steel your spirits, grit your teeth, inspire your subordinates, and fight this battle. Whether we are regarded as men or ghosts in China in the future will be determined in this battle." Zhang Zizhong bows. (14th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Churchill's Broadcast: Reiterating the Belief in War; The Tragedy of the Anglo-French Navy Comes to an End; Resolving to Destroy the Strong Enemy with All Our Strength</h3>
<p>London: Prime Minister Churchill broadcast to the nation last night, saying that in the past half month, the British Navy, in addition to blockading the remaining German fleet and pursuing the Italian fleet, also took on the painful duty of preventing the main French warships from participating in the war. According to the Franco-German armistice agreement, the French fleet must be placed under German power. If this were to happen, it would endanger the security of Britain and the United States. Therefore, we had no other choice but to take the immediate action that we have already taken. This painful task has now been completed. Although the incompletely equipped battleship Jean Bart is now moored in a certain port in Morocco, and some French warships are also moored in Toulon and French ports around the world, these warships are not enough to disrupt the superiority of British naval power. If these French warships do not intend to sail to German or Italian ports, we will not bother them. This tragedy in Anglo-French relations has now come to an end. Now, let us speak of the future.</p>
<p>Deeply Moved by the Fate of France</p>
<p>Today is July 14th, the French National Day. On this day last year, I visited the military parade of the French Army in Paris, and the military appearance was indeed very prosperous. Who could have predicted the changes in one year? And who can predict the changes in the next few years? We stand in awe before the unfolding of human destiny. Trust is assistance and comfort. I dare to announce my trust: we will eventually see a liberated France re-celebrate July 14th in its greatness and glory, and once again be a defender of freedom and justice for mankind. This day will inevitably come. At that time, the French soul will return to the French people who have not been disappointed by the Republic in this dark period. At this time, we do not want to waste precious words. When our friends fighting alongside us are hit and fall, what we have to pay attention to is that the sharp weapon in the hands of this friend must not fall into the hands of the enemy. We should not harbor resentment because of the delirium and painful posture of our friends, but we must work to restore their health. The common interests between Britain and France still exist today. The dual principles and their inevitable responsibilities also exist. If our path to victory is not obstructed, we are prepared to exercise good will towards the French government to the extent possible, encourage trade for French territories that have not broken away from France but maintain their freedom, and assist in their administration. Our war against Hitler is as much a need as iron. We should strive to make the true French people responsive to our method of struggle. Every victory of Britain is a step towards the liberation of Europe from its shackles. Not only France, but also the oppressed countries of Europe will have this feeling.</p>
<p>The Battle Will Be Protracted and Difficult</p>
<p>Judging from various phenomena, this battle will last for quite a long time and will also be difficult. No one can know the extent of the spread of war. However, one thing can be asserted: the people of Europe will never be subjected to Nazi brutal rule for long, and the world will never succumb to Hitler's rule. Now we are dealing with the difficult situation alone. We trust the true master and are confident that our will is unyielding, ready to defend our territory against aggression. Although we are fighting alone, we are not fighting only for ourselves. In this haven gathered for the progress and civilization of mankind, with warships cruising the seas and airplanes covering the skies, we are now waiting for the enemy's attack without any fear. The enemy's attack may be seen tonight, or it may wait until next week, or it may never materialize. We must show the ability to cope with a sudden fierce attack or a long-term struggle. However, no matter how long the war lasts, we will never seek peace or allow negotiations. We can show grace, but we will never beg for grace. Sympathetic observers outside the Atlantic and friends in European countries not yet afflicted by disaster, who do not deeply understand our source of goods and determination, are worried about the survival of Britain because they have seen many countries broken by Nazi forces in a matter of weeks or days. But it must be known that Hitler has not yet encountered a major country with extremely firm willpower. The countries he broke before were mostly poisoned by conspiracy and spies before being overthrown by violence, first rotting internally and then suffering external blows. If not, how can the experience of France, its army, its people, and its leaders be explained? As for our country, it is sound and unharmed. Hitler prepared a plan to destroy his neighbors with scientific precision, treating Poland, Norway, Denmark, Holland, and Belgium one by one in the same way. Even France was destroyed by him. From this, we can know that Hitler has also been planning for years to destroy Britain, which he sees as his main enemy, and has devised a plan to destroy Britain completely. What I can say now is that any plan Hitler has devised for the invasion of Britain in the past two and a half years must now be completely transformed to respond to our new situation. Two months ago, our first and foremost effort was to place the most elite army and all the ordnance in France, and most of our air force had to be sent to France to prepare for war. But now all these forces are in the country. The army standing guard on the British Isles tonight, its number, its equipment, and its disturbance, are unprecedented in the last or this war. Today we have 1.5 million people holding weapons in anticipation, and in June and July, we have seen great progress in their organization, defense, and combat power every week. In the shortest time, there has been such a great change. We cannot praise our military and civilians enough. After the regular army, there are tools to destroy paratroopers and air raiders and clear out internal traitors. I do not believe that there are many internal traitors in the country. If there are any, they will die by their own hands. After the regular army, we still have more than a million defense volunteers, most of whom are veterans of the last battle and are eager to inflict heavy blows on the enemy wherever they appear. If the enemy does invade Britain, the people will never passively lay down their arms and surrender to the enemy as other countries have done. We will defend each village, each town, each city. And the people of London will constantly engage in street battles, not afraid of swallowing up the entire enemy army. We would rather see London turned to ashes than see London be dominated by people in a submissive and cowardly state, like slaves. We have to state this matter because there is a need to reassure the people by explaining our intentions.</p>
<p>The British Air Force Has Made Outstanding Achievements</p>
<p>This week has been a week of outstanding achievements for the British Air Force. The number of German planes disrupting the convoy in the Channel that have been shot down compared to the number of British planes lost is a ratio of five to one. This is only the beginning of a larger war in the future. Although we still hope that the future results can be seen better than this, we can be very comforted by this result at present. The British Navy has a thousand armed warships patrolling the seas, spreading authority far and wide, able to quickly protect any threatened area and maintain British traffic to the New World, and the supply from the New World to Britain is now increasing with the war situation. Enemy submarines and planes have been conducting unrestricted attacks on our commerce for more than ten months, but our stock of food is now more than before, and our ship tonnage is now higher than at the beginning of the war. Is this not very different? However, our efforts will not be slackened by this. We must double our efforts, not only preparing for the summer, but also preparing for the winter, not only preparing for 1941, but also preparing for 1942. By then, I hope that the war situation will be different from the form of attack that we have to adopt at present.</p>
<p>Preparing for War to the Utmost</p>
<p>The reason why I have described in detail the elements of our firepower and the resources of our mobilization and control is to show that our war is justified and we can obtain the tools for survival. We are now managing arduously in a dark period and will eventually see the dawn. As the head of a government representing all parties and all classes of the country, supported by a free parliament and a free press, there is one point on which we are united: that is, we are prepared to fight to the utmost. This is the only way for the country to maintain its freedom and support its doctrine. I hope that the British people all over the world and those who feel good about us can do their best, give up everything, and persevere to the end. This is not a struggle between tribal chiefs or kings or dynasties, but a war of nameless heroes, who are loyal and dedicated to their duties, but whose names are not known and whose deeds are not recorded. We should each be faithful to our beliefs and fulfill our responsibilities, so that Hitler's poisonous flames can eventually be extinguished in our time. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<h3>American Newspapers Praise Churchill's Speech</h3>
<p>New York: The New York Times said today that the British people have never heard their leaders speak as Churchill did yesterday. This is the voice of a free people, prepared to suffer all kinds of pain to protect freedom. The New York Herald Tribune also commented on the British Prime Minister's speech, saying that there was not a single word showing weakness. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>Washington: People all over the United States listened attentively to Prime Minister Churchill's speech last night. People agreed with the Prime Minister's statement that Britain is sound and will not be internally corrupted like France. The numbers of the army and navy and the facts about shipping and food reported by the Prime Minister, in the eyes of the public, are to refute the recent boast of Germany's victory in submarines. The public regards the Prime Minister's statement that he must defend London, even if it is necessary to fight street by street, as not being empty words. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<h3>Romanian Government Strives to Develop Agriculture</h3>

<h3>The Democratic National Convention in the United States Officially Opens Yesterday Afternoon; Roosevelt Expresses the Conditions for Re-election; Reserving the Right to Choose the Vice President</h3>
<p>Chicago: The 28th Democratic National Convention has been held today, and it will set an unprecedented precedent by re-electing President Roosevelt, allowing him to serve a third consecutive term in the White House. At the same time, the leaders who support the New Deal have made it impossible for the party chairman Farley to control President Roosevelt's third term bid, and they clearly oppose Farley's third term. It is rumored that Farley will resign from President Roosevelt's cabinet today, resign from his position as Postmaster General, and will be absent from the position of National Democratic Party Chairman. According to people close to Farley, Farley may take up the position of chairman of a business association. Farley still refused to report his future policy to the press last night, but said that from now on, most of the representatives have expressed their willingness to re-elect President Roosevelt, but his name may be proposed to the conference as one of the participants in the election. Last night, there were many rumors about Vice President Garner's plan. Some said that Garner was unwilling to accept the election of Vice President, and some said that Garner was extremely eager to get the position of President again. Garner is also a person with presidential ambition, and his name may be proposed to the conference by the representatives from Texas. (Central News Agency, 15th)</p>
<p>Chicago: The Democratic National Convention is scheduled to open here this afternoon. The meeting procedures have been prepared. Yesterday, President Roosevelt was sailing on the Potomac River. However, the President is only superficially isolated from the political situation. Commerce Minister Hopkins, who is President's close friend and the most intimate political assistant, is now handling President's affairs at the conference, and Hopkins has also installed a special telephone line directly to the White House. The movement to nominate President Roosevelt for a third term has been spreading across the country for several months and is now intensifying. This move has at least gained President Roosevelt's passive consent. The first vote will be held on Thursday, and the President may get about 90% of the votes at that time. If Roosevelt refuses to accept, he will be the first person in American history to refuse to be a presidential candidate. According to very accurate political observers, the President will accept because the nominators are truly automatically pushing him out, and will "sacrifice" himself and compete again. There are three reasons: (1) This is the will of the people; (2) The new measures are threatened by Willkie (Republican candidate for President); (3) He can lead the country through an unprecedented international emergency with experienced means. Some observers believe that in order to comply with the traditional practice of not serving three consecutive terms, the President may explain that he will resign after the country safely passes the world crisis, so that the Vice President can succeed him. According to Washington's expectations, after the Democratic National Convention nominates President Roosevelt, the aid-to-Britain movement will accelerate. Most of the internal and external policies that may cause disputes have recently been delayed due to political sources. However, the assistance that has already been given to Britain will continue to be provided. According to those in charge, four out of every five airplanes now being made in the United States will be shipped to Britain. This is an example of the United States continuing to aid Britain. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>Chicago: President Roosevelt said today that he has the strongest supporters, which is what previous American presidents did not have. He then stated the conditions under which he would be willing to serve a third term as President. The President's advisors informed the Democratic leaders of Roosevelt's conditions last night. The content is reportedly as follows: (1) The President's re-election to a third term as President must be unopposed; (2) His name cannot be used for promotion; (3) The right to reserve the selection of the Vice President. Democratic leaders have not yet expressed whether they will allow this major request, but it is believed that they will be able to comply, so as to achieve victory in mid-November. (International News Agency, 15th)</p>
<p>Washington: President Roosevelt has not yet taken any action on whether to participate in the third election. The President has just returned to the White House from the Potomac. He has not issued any speeches or announcements regarding the political situation or his future policies. However, today the Democratic leaders in this area and Chicago all believe that President Roosevelt may accept the nomination of the Democratic Party this week. (United Press International, 15th)</p>

<h3>Japan Closes off Zhejiang and Fujian Coasts Under Pretext of "Military Necessity," Aiming to Exclude Third-Party Trade; British Authorities Have Lodged Strong Protests</h3>
<p>Vice Admiral Shigematsu Shimada, commander of the Japanese fleet in China, under the pretext of "military necessity," suddenly announced at 10:00 AM this morning the closure of the coastal ports of Xiangshanpu, Wenzhou, Sandu'ao, and Fuzhou in Zhejiang and Fujian provinces, effective today. It is claimed that this is "to prevent third countries from using these routes to transport arms to aid China after the blockade of Vietnam." In reality, it is another act of aggression aimed at excluding third-party trade with China and disrupting the Chinese people. It is reported that Japanese Consul General in Shanghai, Yoshiaki Miura, has already notified the relevant authorities and customs of various countries in this port of this notice, forcing British ships traveling to Fuzhou, Shantou, Wenzhou, and Ningbo to cease operations.</p>
<p>All Ports in South China Blockaded</p>
<p>According to the notice issued by Fleet Commander Shimada, from midnight on July 15th, all ships are prohibited from entering the following areas, and ships that violate or attempt to enter will be detained by naval forces. The Japanese Navy will not be responsible for any direct or indirect damage to personnel or ships entering or leaving the area after the specified date and time. The blockaded areas are: (1) The waters of Xiangshanpu in Hangzhou Bay, including the line connecting Xushan and the Xihuoshan Island lighthouse, the north-south line passing through Shenjiamen in the Zhoushan Islands, and the east-west line passing through the southern tip of Liuheng Island; (2) Wenzhou Port and its surrounding waters and Yueqing Bay, including the line connecting Nanpaishan and the eastern end of Dongtoushan Island, and the east-west line passing through Banmianshan; (3) Sandu'ao and Luoyuan Bay, west of the 340-degree line passing through Beijiaozui; (4) Fuzhou Port and its surrounding waters, including the north-south line passing through Dinghai and the 45-degree line passing through Black Head.</p>
<p>Recent Situation of Shanghai-Ningbo Shipping</p>
<p>Since the authorities allowed small ships to enter the Zhenhai Estuary blockade line on the Shanghai-Ningbo route to load and unload passengers and goods on the Jiangbei shore, direct voyages have been convenient. The Gaodeng and Changde ships were the first to operate, followed by Shantai, Ruitai, Haifu, Aweima Li, and other ships. Recently, the Jiangding and Jiangsu ships have joined the route, bringing the total number of ships operating direct voyages on the Shanghai-Ningbo route to eight. The Deping and Moufu ships operate on the Shanghai-Zhenhai route. The Deping ship entered the dock for repairs at the end of last month and has not yet been completed, so only the Moufu ship operates on the Shanghai-Zhenhai route, with a schedule of one trip every six days. It is expected to return to Shanghai tomorrow and sail to Zhenhai on the 17th.</p>
<p>Temporary Suspension of Flights and Passengers Leaving Ships</p>
<p>Yesterday, there were four ships traveling direct on the Shanghai-Ningbo route: the Ruitai ship of the Hualun Shipping Company, the Aweima Li ship of the Guo Side Shipping Company, the Changde ship of the Luo Kezhi Shipping Company, and the British-owned Jiangsu ship managed by Taichangxiang. Yesterday afternoon, passengers boarded the ships and goods were being loaded when they suddenly received notification from their respective companies to suspend sailings to Ningbo. The passengers were stunned and work stopped immediately. Passengers questioned the crew about the reason for not departing, and were generally told that Ningbo's Zhenhai Estuary was blockaded and that sailings were temporarily suspended, or that sailings would resume in a day or two. The passengers reluctantly carried their suitcases and returned to their residences.</p>
<p>Customs Notification Prohibiting Sailing to Ningbo</p>
<p>Yesterday was the first time the Jiangsu ship was operating on the Shanghai-Ningbo direct route, but it unexpectedly faced a temporary suspension. As for the reason for the temporary suspension of the ships sailing to Ningbo, the company claimed that they received a notice from the customs commissioner at around 4:00 PM yesterday, temporarily prohibiting sailing to Ningbo.</p>
<p>British Authorities Closely Watching</p>
<p>The English-language North China Daily News stated that Vice Admiral Shigematsu Shimada, commander-in-chief of the Japanese fleet in China, issued a notice at 10:00 AM this morning (15th), stating that due to "military necessity," all ships, including those of third countries, are prohibited from entering or leaving the areas of Hangzhou Bay, Wenzhou Port, Sandu'ao, and Fuzhou Bay along the coasts of Zhejiang and Fujian provinces, in order to cut off the routes supplying the central government from Vietnam and Burma.</p>
<p>The Japanese Navy will not be held directly or indirectly responsible for any losses incurred by ships entering or leaving the above areas from midnight on the 15th. This notice was delivered by Vice Admiral Shimada to the consulates of various countries and the Jianghai Customs through Japanese Consul General Miura. It is reported that the Japanese side has ordered British ships to leave Fuzhou, Sandu'ao, Wenzhou, and Ningbo, and to cease sailing to these ports, as the Japanese side will begin operations against these ports tomorrow (16th). This afternoon, according to the British naval authorities in Shanghai, the matter is under consideration, but the notice received was too brief to make a clear statement. Colonel James, the British coastal liaison officer in Shanghai, said that he is studying the contents of the Japanese announcement and will visit Japanese officials this afternoon.</p>
<p>Foreign Merchants Gather to Discuss Protests</p>
<p>The Japanese side's sudden announcement of the blockade of the Zhejiang and Fujian coastal routes has caused great alarm in the shipping industry in this port. The ships operating on the Shanghai-Ningbo and Shanghai-Fujian routes are all owned by third-country shipping companies, and operating along the Chinese coast is permitted under international law and should not be interfered with by any country. Yesterday, the Japanese naval authorities warned foreign ships to cease operations, hindering the legitimate business of foreign merchants. Therefore, the authorities of these shipping companies are currently trying to gather together and request that their respective consulates in Shanghai file serious protests with the Japanese side.</p>
<p>British Authorities File Protests</p>
<p>A message from the British Embassy in this port was recently released, as follows: The Japanese naval authorities issued a notice yesterday that they intend to take action against the coastal ports of China (Wenzhou, Ningbo, Santiao (transliteration), Fuzhou) on July 16th. The British authorities have filed protests with the Japanese side, stating that the notice issued is incomplete and declaring that the Japanese naval authorities will be fully responsible for all losses or damages suffered by British ships as a result of the Japanese actions. The British authorities also protested that the areas mentioned in the Japanese notice include several important anchorages for ships to take shelter from storms, and that as the hurricane season is currently underway, ships may need to sail to these anchorages to take shelter from the wind. Therefore, the British authorities will also hold the Japanese authorities fully responsible for any losses or damages suffered by British ships due to the inability to take shelter from the wind.</p>
<h3>Sauce and Wine Industry Association Sets Deadline for Verifying Measuring Instruments</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Sauce and Wine Industry Association, in light of the inevitable reduction in capacity of measuring instruments used by members of the industry, held a special meeting and resolved that all measuring instruments used by members must be verified by the association, starting with the French Concession and then extending to the International Settlement. The verification period for members in the French Concession is limited to the 20th of this month. If existing measuring instruments are deemed合格 by the association after verification, they may continue to be used after being stamped by the association; otherwise, they must be replaced. It is now reported that standard measuring instruments have been approved by the French Concession Price Equalization Committee and have been forwarded to the police department for reference. Once the verification of measuring instruments is completed, the association will report daily market prices. From then on, the market prices of measuring instruments in the sauce and wine industry will be consistent.</p>
<h3>Peace Rumors Abound Again; Latest Telegram from London Denies the Matter</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, a United Press report from Singapore stated that Singapore Administrator Jones broadcast on the evening of the 14th that the United Kingdom was currently "making its most sincere efforts to promote peace between China and Japan." At the same time, an International News Service report from Hong Kong stated that the German ambassador had returned to Chongqing and was rumored to be willing to mediate the Sino-Japanese war. Various news reports arrived suddenly. All sectors in this port, having repeatedly refuted peace rumors in the past, and the government having clarified its national policy and proven with facts that they were purely rumors, are extremely steadfast in their resolve. Only the market slightly fluctuated due to these rumors, but quickly returned to normal. By last night, a United Press report from London stated that the Chinese Embassy in London also believed that the Chongqing National Government had never received such peace proposals, and believed that Jones' broadcast seemed to overstate the facts. At the same time, the information office of the British Embassy in this port indicated that it was not necessary to pay too much attention to what Jones said, as what he said was merely restating his long-held wishes. According to inquiries made to the German Embassy in this port, German Information Officer Kord stated that "the so-called Ambassador Trautmann has returned to Chongqing to make 'Sino-Japanese peace' efforts" is not true. It seems that the aforementioned rumors cannot be confirmed by the official representatives of England and Germany in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Japanese Military Police Incident Nearing Resolution; Americans and Japanese Scuffle Again; Occurred in the Oriental Café; Cause Still Unknown</h3>
<p>The case of the U.S. Fourth Marine Regiment detaining sixteen Japanese military police has been resolved through repeated negotiations between the United States and Japan. The "insult" case has come to an end. At 11:00 AM yesterday morning, Japanese military police commander Miura met with Colonel Baker again to discuss a solution. It was rumored that a joint statement from both sides, though not released as scheduled yesterday, was expected to be announced in the near future. Unexpectedly, just as one wave subsided, another rose. Around 11:00 PM the night before, a conflict occurred between soldiers of the U.S. Fourth Marine Regiment and Japanese residents in the Oriental Café on Metcalfe Road. Two Japanese residents were seriously injured. The U.S. naval authorities are investigating the details of the incident, and the police authorities of the Japanese consulate have already released an account of the events. The future development of this matter is currently unknown. It is generally believed that if the Japanese residents and soldiers in Shanghai continue to act as if they are "victors," then under this kind of self-intoxicated "sense of superiority," there will be endless troubles and no peace.</p>
<p>Japanese Side Releases Preliminary Information</p>
<p>The English-language North China Daily News stated that at 11:00 PM last night (14th), three uniformed soldiers of the U.S. Fourth Marine Regiment and two Japanese civilians scuffled in the Oriental Café on Metcalfe Road. It is reported that the Japanese were all seriously injured. U.S. military officers are investigating the incident this morning (15th). The police department of the Japanese consulate released preliminary information on the matter, stating that several Japanese were drinking in the Oriental Café last night when three U.S. soldiers entered, appearing to be drunk. A fight broke out, the cause of which is unknown. Eventually, both sides left the café, apparently resolving the matter themselves. Ten minutes later, two Japanese employees of a certain textile factory entered the Oriental Café and sat down to drink when the three U.S. soldiers returned and scuffled with the two Japanese again. The cause is also unknown. The two Japanese suffered serious injuries to their faces and were also severely cut. The U.S. and Japanese authorities are currently continuing to investigate the case and have not yet released an official statement. It is noted that about three months ago, a Japanese man was stabbed in the back in the Oriental Café, allegedly by a British soldier from the West Fife Light Infantry. This caused a serious reaction at the time. Regarding the case of the U.S. soldiers arresting sixteen Japanese military police on July 7th, Major General Miura, commander of the Japanese military police in Shanghai, and Colonel Baker, commander of the U.S. Fourth Marine Regiment, met again this morning to study the joint statement that will be released. Officials indicated that the statement will likely be released tomorrow morning (16th).</p>
<p>Private Quarrel Not Likely to Escalate</p>
<p>According to another Western source, a Japanese spokesperson stated in the press room yesterday that the Japanese authorities consider the quarrel between U.S. naval soldiers and Japanese residents that occurred in the Oriental Café on Metcalfe Road at 11:30 PM on Sunday to be purely a private disturbance caused by drunkenness and not worthy of attention. It appears that the incident occurred when U.S. naval soldiers quarreled with Japanese, but the matter subsided after they left. Later, two more Japanese entered the café, and the U.S. naval soldiers returned as well. For unknown reasons, a quarrel broke out again, and the Japanese were struck in the head and shoulders with bottles, requiring two weeks to recover from their injuries. The Japanese consular police are currently investigating the matter, and the authorities of the U.S. Fourth Marine Regiment are also investigating the truth.</p>
<h3>Recent Situation of the Yunnan-Vietnam Transportation Route; Michelin Express Not Operating; Bridge at Majie Station Interrupted</h3>
<p>After the resumption of shipping on the Shanghai-Haiphong route, the transportation of goods to the interior via Vietnam has been temporarily suspended. Therefore, there are no goods on ships traveling from Shanghai to Haiphong. According to a travel agency, recent news on the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway is as follows:</p>
<p>Express Train Suspended</p>
<p>The bridge attached to Majie Station, 34 kilometers north of Hekou on the Yunnan section of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, has been damaged and has not yet been repaired. Therefore, the Michelin Express is still temporarily suspended. Slow trains are operating as usual, but passengers must disembark and cross at the damaged bridge, and luggage must be transferred.</p>
<p>Additional Night Trains</p>
<p>Between Hanoi and Lao Cai, an additional night train has been added every night except Tuesdays and Fridays since June 23rd, with the same schedule. However, only first- and second-class sleeping cars are added on Tuesdays and Fridays; the other days only have ordinary first-, second-, and third-class passenger cars. Luggage carried by passengers traveling from Haiphong to Kunming is limited to 60 kilograms and must be carried with them. When transported by rail, the limit is 250 kilograms only for the Haiphong-Lao Cai section. The luggage limit is looser from Lao Cai to Kunming, but passengers are responsible for hiring porters to transfer luggage across the damaged bridge, and this is limited to clothing, bedding, and personal belongings. Other items are absolutely restricted. Passengers traveling from Kunming to Haiphong are not subject to the above restrictions. A certain travel agency has dispatched personnel to Majie Station to assist passengers in taking care of their luggage.</p>
<p>Flight Schedules</p>
<p>The schedules of various airlines, such as Air France and Imperial Airways, are operating as usual, but the schedules may change temporarily. The China National Aviation Corporation's Kunming-Hekou route still operates on Wednesdays and Saturdays, but has been changed to a same-day round trip. The Air Transport Administration of the Ministry of Communications has also dispatched aircraft to operate the Kunming-Hekou route since last week, tentatively once a week, flying from Kunming to Hekou on Mondays and returning the same day.</p>
<p>Freight Regulations</p>
<p>The transportation of all goods to the interior via Vietnam has been suspended. The reporting of border taxes for items carried by Shanghai-Hong Kong passengers traveling to the interior via Haiphong has also been temporarily suspended. However, passengers traveling from Kunming to Haiphong are not subject to these restrictions. Goods exported from the interior via Vietnam can now be transported as usual.</p>
<h3>Japanese Ship Daishan Maru Disappears After Being Captured; Japanese Planes and Warships Scout in All Directions; Loitering Around Chuanshan Near Ningbo</h3>
<p>The Japanese ship Daishan Maru set sail from Daishan on the 6th of this month, heading for Shenjiadou Town. While passing the Hengliang waters, the ship was suddenly seized by the inspection unit of the Dinghai Maritime Guerrilla Force. Huang Bohe, the puppet "chairman" of Daishan, and a group of more than twenty people were also arrested. The whereabouts of the ship and Huang are currently unknown.</p>
<p>Japanese Reconnaissance</p>
<p>Since the disappearance of the Daishan Maru, Japanese aircraft have been scouting the coast of Ningbo quite frequently. Chuanshan in Zhenhai was once bombarded by Japanese warships. The American Merope ship outside Zhenhai Port was chased by Japanese aircraft to the Jintang waters. It seems that the Japanese pilot mistook the ship for the Daishan Maru. The Merope recently transported rice from Hong Kong to Ningbo and was greatly frightened by the chase by the Japanese aircraft. It has now unloaded its cargo and returned to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Guerrilla Activity</p>
<p>According to visitors from Dinghai, the personnel of the "maintenance association" of the Dinghai Maritime Guerrilla Force are quite wary. It is also learned that the government's orders can still be conveyed normally in the 53 rural towns under the jurisdiction of Dinghai County, except for the four areas occupied by the city, Yamenqian, Daishan, and Shenjiamen.</p>
<h3>European Refugees Can Reside in the Concessions; Must Obtain an Entry Permit from the Concession Authorities</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council issued a set of regulations on October 22nd of last year regarding the complete accommodation of refugees from Europe in the International Settlement. These regulations have been revised and are being implemented from this month onwards. Therefore, European refugees residing in the International Settlement must comply with the following provisions: (1) Refugees are not allowed to reside in the Settlement without obtaining an entry permit from the Shanghai Municipal Police. The issuance of permits is at the discretion of the Police. (2) Only refugees in the following categories may apply for entry permits: (A) Those who have or possess at least US$400 for adults and US$100 for children under the age of thirteen, or the equivalent in other foreign currencies, through the Committee for the Relief of European Jewish Refugees in Shanghai; (B) Those who are direct relatives (i.e., parents, spouses, children) of refugees residing in Shanghai who have proven financial means; (C) Those who hold employment contracts with Shanghai residents; (D) Those who intend to marry individuals residing in Shanghai. (3) Entry permits issued are valid for only four months.

<h3>Japanese Army to Hold Night Exercises; Date is the Late Evening of the 20th</h3>
<p>From the late evening of the 20th to the morning of the 21st of this month, the Japanese Naval Landing Forces will hold night exercises of considerable scale within their so-called security zone. The exercise area will be announced by the Japanese military authorities. That night will again disturb the peaceful dreams of many residents.</p>
<h3>Resolution of the Shengjing Ship Case; British Naval Authorities Accept Japanese Protest; French Request for the Return of Military Supplies Denied</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury stated that the press corps of the Japanese fleet in China announced yesterday (14th) that the Shengjing Ship case of the Taikoo Company was satisfactorily resolved on Sunday evening after the relevant British authorities formally expressed regret to the Japanese naval authorities and issued strict warnings to all British shipping companies and merchant ships flying the British flag, and the Shengjing ship, moored outside Wusong Port, was allowed to resume its regular coastal shipping. The communiqué described the circumstances leading to the Shengjing ship's detention on July 9th and disclosed that the Japanese side had lodged a protest with the British naval authorities, stating that the Shengjing ship was carrying ammunition from Tianjin to Shanghai for France, a belligerent country, which violated Japan's policy of preventing the expansion of the European war to the Far East, and demanded that the French ammunition be handed over to the Japanese side. The British side agreed, and the French ammunition was unloaded at Wusong on July 11th. Discussions then took place on the issue of the Shengjing ship disregarding the Japanese order to cease operations. The British authorities finally accepted the Japanese request, and the Shengjing ship case was resolved. As for the British ship's actions, the Japanese naval authorities ordered the Shengjing ship to return to port immediately after the ammunition was unloaded, allowing it to act freely after the resolution of the incident.</p>
<p>While the issue was not fully resolved, the French defense forces in this city requested the British authorities to ask the Japanese navy to return the ammunition, but the Japanese authorities refused and explained the reasons why the ammunition could not be returned. The French side then withdrew its request.</p>
<h3>Coolidge Liner Arrives in Shanghai from Hong Kong: Carrying a Large Number of Passengers; Unprecedented Crowding; Rumors Abound in Hong Kong, But No Facts to Prove Them</h3>
<p>The American President Coolidge liner arrived in Shanghai yesterday. The number of passengers it carried was unprecedented. Those disembarking in Shanghai included 114 first-class passengers, 135 third-class passengers, and 103 tourists. In addition, there were 464 passengers passing through Shanghai, most of whom were bound for San Francisco. According to an official of the American President Lines yesterday, all cabins on the ship were fully booked even before the "invasion" panic in Hong Kong. Later arrivals only sought a small space, barely enough to kneel, and did not mind the conditions. Although the Hong Kong company tried its best to accommodate everyone, many were still left behind.</p>
<p>Rumors in Hong Kong are Rampant, but Difficult to Confirm</p>
<p>According to passengers on board, rumors were rife in Hong Kong, even saying that Japanese troops had crossed the Shenzhen border. At the same time, refugees fleeing from the occupied areas made the local residents terrified. However, these rumors could not be confirmed. The large-scale evacuation of Hong Kong residents is an undeniable fact. Every outgoing ship was packed to the brim, extremely crowded. Passengers only sought to get on board, regardless of cabin class. According to officials at the Jianghai Customs, the luggage brought by the President Coolidge was piled up like a mountain, a truly unprecedented sight. It is expected that the customs clearance process will take a whole day.</p>
<p>Loading Delayed, Departure This Afternoon</p>
<p>The ship was originally scheduled to leave Shanghai for the United States at 11:00 PM last night. However, due to the large amount of cargo and the time required for loading and unloading, the departure has been changed to 11:30 AM this afternoon. The farewell ferry will depart from the Xinguang Wharf at 10:00 AM this morning. In addition, the company's world-class liner, the President Adams, originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai from the United States via Japan today, has been slightly delayed due to a hurricane at sea a few days ago. It is now expected to arrive in Shanghai at noon tomorrow (the 17th), berthing at buoys 12 and 13. It is reported that the ship is carrying 38 passengers and 60 people passing through Shanghai to Southeast Asia and around the world. The reception ferry will depart from the Xinguang Wharf at 11:30 AM tomorrow and return to the Xinguang Wharf at 1:00 PM in the afternoon to disembark passengers. The ship is scheduled to depart for Hong Kong at 1:45 AM on the 19th (i.e., midnight on the 18th), via Luzon and various ports in Southeast Asia, then via Bombay and the Cape of Good Hope back to New York. The final farewell ferry will depart from the Xinguang Wharf at 12:15 AM on the 19th (i.e., midnight on the 18th).</p>
<p>The Interior of China is Full of Vitality</p>
<p>It is reported that among the passengers arriving in Shanghai on the President Coolidge yesterday morning were Mr. McHugh, Naval Attaché of the American Embassy, Mr. Steed, Chairman of the Board of the China Press and Evening Post, and Mr. Fei Wusheng, former Secretary-General of the YMCA. According to Mr. McHugh, the American Ambassador to China, Mr. Johnson, will soon come to Shanghai from Chongqing. Mr. Steed went to Hong Kong for business reasons a month ago and returned to Shanghai yesterday. According to Mr. Fei, "The evacuation of overseas Chinese from Hong Kong was indeed the wisest measure in terms of preparedness." Mr. Fei had lived in the interior of China for the past two and a half years. When the Japanese army attacked Nanjing, he was still in Nanjing. After that, he went to Chongqing and did not leave until a month ago. It is said that the situation in China's wartime capital is quite enthusiastic and serious, and the spirit of the Chinese people is also the same. There is no pessimism in Chongqing. Any event, although extremely difficult at present, can continue to proceed with a good spirit. He also said that when he left Hong Kong, the situation in Hong Kong was still very peaceful, and the evacuation did not cause serious difficulties. Therefore, the evacuation of overseas Chinese was in fact the wisest move. It is said that Mr. Fei will stay in Shanghai for a short time and then plans to travel to the United States.</p>
<h3>Salvation Army Concludes Work at Shelter, Thousands of Refugees See Them off</h3>
<p>The Salvation Army in Shanghai took over the first shelter on Dunxin Road in July last year and has now completed one year of service. The decision to withdraw was made by the North China Headquarters, which will send them to other assignments. The Shanghai Relief Association requested them to stay, but the request was not granted. Yesterday, the Association's Management Office Director Guan Jiongzhi, Chen Xianmo, and others took over the shelter. The Salvation Army completed the handover on the same day. At the same time, thousands of staff and refugees in the shelter set off firecrackers, presented flags, and were seen off by the band of the Orphanage. At that time, both sides felt happy. It is reported that the Association has reassigned Zhang Nairen as the director, Wang Jinghao as the deputy director, and Wang Yangqiao and Zheng Dahua as the general directors.</p>

<h3>The Establishment of the Special Police in Western Shanghai is Still Difficult; The Puppet Regime Has Replied to the Municipal Council, But the Two Sides' Opinions Are Not Consistent</h3>
<p>According to the Information Office of the Municipal Council, on April 26 of this year, the Director of the Police Department of the Council, Mr. Bowness, sent a draft agreement on the transfer of police power in Western Shanghai to Mr. Lu Ying, "Director of the Municipal Police Bureau." The above-mentioned draft agreement included the results of previous exchanges of opinions. The Council received a reply from "Mayor" Fu Xiao'an on the 13th of this month.</p>
<p>Research and Suggestions According to reporters from Da Zhong News Agency, regarding the issue of establishing a "new police authority in the Western Shanghai Extra-Settlement Roads Area," "Mayor" Fu Xiao'an submitted a suggestive "agreement" to the Municipal Council yesterday. This negotiation has now entered the final stage. According to the Municipal Council, this suggestion is currently under study to determine whether it is consistent with the trial agreement established by Chief Superintendent Bowness of the Police Department and "Police Director" Lu.</p>
<p>No Establishment Date</p>
<p>According to observers with access to information, the news from the Japanese side that the "New Police Station" will be established on August 1 seems overly optimistic. They pointed out that even if the agreement is formally established, it will still take considerable time to find housing and prepare uniforms. Japanese sources said that the "Preparatory Committee" for the establishment of the "Special Police" has been organized by the Municipal Council and the puppet "Municipal Government" and will be established on Monday. It is said that the work of this "Preparatory Committee" is to select "police officers" and solve various technical problems.</p>
<p>Dispute over Personnel</p>
<p>The Japanese side also reported that after the establishment of the "New Police Station," 280 Chinese, British, and Japanese patrolmen will be dispatched to protect the Extra-Settlement Roads Area. Sources with access to information also said that the Municipal Council and the puppet "Municipal Government" are still in dispute over the selection of the "Director of the Criminal Division" of the "New Police Station." It is said that the Municipal Council insists that the "Director of the Criminal Division" should be a British person, while the "Municipal Government" opposes this proposal.</p>
<h3>Hurricane Approaches Japan, Prepare for High Tides; Fear of Coinciding with Hurricane; Warehouses Start Flood Prevention</h3>
<p>According to reporters from Datong News Agency who inquired at the Xujiahui Observatory, the Pacific hurricane, after passing east of Shanghai, is now advancing towards Japan. According to the Xujiahui Observatory, the hurricane reached 41 degrees north latitude and 138 degrees east longitude at 6:00 AM yesterday. The center of the storm is within 120 nautical miles. The wind force is unknown. It has crossed the Taiwan Strait and is advancing towards Japan.</p>
<p>Climate</p>
<p>Since the hurricane passed to the east of Shanghai, the climate has been extremely hot. Yesterday, the highest temperature rose to 94.5 degrees. The highest temperature last year was only 85.6 degrees. Because the wind is calm, the heat is even more unbearable. The epidemic hospitals are overcrowded. At the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital alone, the number of outpatients yesterday reached more than 500.</p>
<p>Tides</p>
<p>There will be high tides in the Huangpu River from the 19th of this month. According to the Huangpu Conservancy Bureau, the levels will be between 11 feet. If a hurricane coincides with this time, Shanghai will face a rather serious flood. Therefore, the relevant departments are paying close attention. In addition, the flood prevention work of the riverside warehouses in Shanghai has already begun.</p>
<h3>Severe Drought and Famine in Zhenjiang, Jintan, and Lishui, No Less Than in Ningbo and Shaoxing</h3>
<p>Drought has caused a disaster. There has been no rain for months. The fields are cracked, and a drought has formed. There is a rice shortage in five counties, and the situation is serious. The cries of starving people are everywhere. Since spring, there has been little rainfall. Today, people from our hometowns came and said that initially, the selling price of white rice was 40 yuan per dan. After the Dragon Boat Festival, the rice seedlings could not be planted, and the price of rice rose step by step. Recently, it has reached a high price of 120 yuan, but each household is limited to buying only two sheng per day. Families with many people have difficulty surviving. In the shortest period, it is feared that the grain stores will have no rice to sell. There are more than three million disaster victims in the five counties, crying for food. We hope that the fellow villagers from the five counties in Shanghai will donate generously. If there are donations, please hand them over to reliable banks. After the Five Counties Disaster Relief Association is established, they will be remitted.</p>
<h3>Municipal Council Discusses Rent Issues; Focus on the Profiteering of Subletters; Landlords Generally Increase Rent by Only 10%; Subletters Increase it by More Than Double</h3>
<p>According to the Municipal Council, at the beginning of June this year, several senior officials of the Council had several discussions on the issue of rent in the Public Settlement. The discussions were chaired by the Director-General and President of the Council. The senior officials included the Council's lawyer, the Chief of the Finance Department, the Chief of the Taxes Department, and the Director of the Industrial Section. They reviewed the legal, evaluation, and social aspects of the rent issue. At the same time, they sought information from landlords and other relevant parties for research.</p>
<p>Rent Increase Comparison</p>
<p>The officials were particularly concerned about the disparity between the percentage increase in rent for Chinese-style houses paid by subletters to landlords and the percentage increase paid by tenants to subletters. The former is mostly restricted by court rulings, increasing by 10% compared to before the war, while the latter, according to the cost of living index, has increased by 205%.</p>
<p>Negotiations</p>
<p>Fifteen members of the Rent Investigation Committee organized by the French Municipal Council participated, including representatives of Chinese nationality. The landlord representatives were Xu Maotang and Qu Zhenhua, and the tenant representatives were Wang Runsheng and Zhu Wende. The committee is scheduled to hold its first meeting at 10:00 AM this morning at the French Municipal Council Administration Building at 375 Avenue Joffre to discuss the committee's rules of procedure and various issues related to rent.</p>
<h3>Lawyer Mi Xitong's Opinion on Group Life Insurance</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Bar Association intends to organize group life insurance for its members and has drafted an outline of the plan, sending letters to all members to solicit opinions. The details have been seen in various newspapers. The following is a record of the opinions of lawyer Mi Xitong, a member of the association, on this plan. Lawyer Mi said that group life insurance is indeed a good thing for the members, but the method must be carefully considered to avoid any oversights. In my opinion, there are many concerns about the association handling this insurance itself. The complexity of the procedures and the importance of the responsibilities are beyond the ability of non-specialized personnel and those not dedicated to their duties. For example, Article 7 of the plan outline states, "A separate management committee will be formed to be responsible for the custody and use of this fund, investing it in stable and reliable enterprises." Most of the members of the association are preoccupied with their work and rarely have enough time to devote themselves to it. It is practically impossible to ask them to be fully responsible. Moreover, investment is not guaranteed to be profitable unless it is done by those with rich experience and superior knowledge. If there is even a slight mistake, the funds will no longer be available. Who will be responsible? This is the guarantee that members must demand. Also, Article 4 of the outline states, "According to past memories, the average annual mortality rate is about 24 per thousand people." This is an unfounded assumption. If it exceeds this rate, it may be possible to make up for it if it is a small number. But if the difference is too large, who can pay for this huge amount of compensation, and from whom will it be recovered? All of the above must be carefully considered in advance.</p>

<h3>Mother-in-law Sues Daughter-in-law for Abandoning Her Daughter and Injuring Her Elders</h3>
<p>Madam Xu Tangshi, a local elderly woman residing at 310 Jaxi Road, is 54 years old this year. She has recently retained lawyer Yin Yong to file a lawsuit with the Criminal Court of the Special Second District Court, accusing her daughter-in-law Xu Qu Jinfang (19 years old, from Changzhou) and her mother, Madam Qu (residing at 6 Shenyu Lane, Wuding Road, McGin Road), of abandoning her daughter and conspiring to commit assault. She requested that the court investigate and prosecute according to the law. It is said that the plaintiff's son Yun Sheng is currently doing business in Nanjing. In the winter of the 27th year of the Republic of China (1938), he married Qu Jisheng's daughter, the first defendant, through a matchmaker. After entering the family, she often complained about the poverty of her husband's family. The plaintiff and her son Yun Sheng often persuaded and comforted her. On February 9th of this year, she gave birth to a granddaughter named Baodi. The first defendant breastfed and raised her herself. The plaintiff handled household chores at home. Unexpectedly, the first defendant often made excuses to return to Ningbo, often taking her clothes and bags with her. On June 18th, at 3:00 PM, the first defendant abandoned her daughter Baodi on the bed and suddenly wanted to leave. At this time, the plaintiff discovered that all her jewelry and clothes had been secretly taken away. Under these circumstances, as the head of the family, she naturally asked reasonable questions. If you leave without taking your child, who will breastfeed her? How can you come and go so casually? Unexpectedly, the first defendant immediately responded with abusive words. The plaintiff, thinking of the baby girl who was only four months old, and the dire consequences if no one raised her, grabbed the first defendant's hair in a panic and pushed her away. The plaintiff was old and weak and had to endure the humiliation, weeping silently. The next day, at 5:00 PM, the first defendant, accompanied by her mother, the second defendant, and the male matchmaker Feng Xinyi, along with four unknown women, came to the plaintiff's house and, without asking why, slapped and beat the plaintiff indiscriminately. It was not until the plaintiff's daughter Huizhen ran out to shout for help that the defendants and others fled. The defendants' actions of abandoning her daughter and conspiring to commit assault are in violation of Articles 294 and 277 of the Criminal Code, and the plaintiff requests that the court investigate and prosecute according to the law, etc. According to the complaint, the court, presided over by Judge Zhang Minsheng, opened a hearing yesterday. The plaintiff and her agent lawyer appeared in court and stated the above. The defendants and their defense lawyer also appeared in court, denying the facts of abandoning the girl and assault, stating that the plaintiff abused the daughter-in-law, did not feed her enough, and forced her to return to her mother's house, etc. After verifying the statements in court, the court instructed to reschedule the hearing to the 29th and ordered both parties to reconcile outside the court.</p>

<h3>Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editor: According to my client, Mr. Zhang Deyu, manager of the Linji Coffin Transport Company, "The report published in your newspaper on the 12th of this month regarding the lawsuit against Linji Coffin Transport Company is entirely one-sided. Since its establishment, our company has been operating for decades and has long been known for its credit by various clan associations and guild halls. The sinking of the ship in Xuliujing, Hupu, due to the storm was an act of God that could not be resisted. How could the coffin relatives, Wu Fatin, etc., who do not understand the facts, be instigated by our company's former accounting office to fabricate false accusations and extort money, claiming 'fraud and breach of trust'? Our company has transported the coffin on a special ship, but it did not reach its destination due to sinking in the middle. How can this be called fraud and breach of trust? As for the claim of 'repainting old coffins and selling them at high prices,' where is the evidence? Who was it sold to? Even more ridiculous is the claim of 'not pointing out the boatman.' During the court hearing on the 11th, our company brought the boatman Wu Jinsheng to court for questioning, and the facts are all there. How can they be allowed to make such reckless statements? Although the truth will eventually come out after a judgment, the constant fabrication of facts and arbitrary defamation during the litigation process will not only confuse the public but also affect our company's reputation. Therefore, we have entrusted you to write to the newspaper for clarification." In view of this, we hereby write to your newspaper to request that it be published in the "Letters to the Editor" section to clarify the matter and prevent misunderstandings. Yours sincerely, Lawyer Yang Xun, July 14, 29th year of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>To the Editor: According to Mr. Xia Hanzhang of the Xiadexing Matting Company, "Yesterday, I read in your newspaper a report about a fire on Nanjing Road, stating that it was suddenly discovered in the Xiadexing Matting Company on the upper floor. After investigation, our warehouse here is locked and not inhabited. There are no electric lights installed, and it has been locked for more than 15 hours. There is no possibility of a fire in the upper floor warehouse. The cause of the fire clearly originated from the lower floor. This report is likely based on inaccurate hearsay. In addition to entrusting your lawyer to issue a statement in the newspaper, we also request that you write a special letter to the newspaper to clarify the matter and correct the information." In view of this, we hereby write to you and request that it be published in the "Letters to the Editor" column for clarification. Yours sincerely, Lawyer Shi Qinghua.</p>
<p>To the Editor: This lawyer, according to the perennial legal counsel of Huierkang's legal representative, holds that the Huierkang store was mentioned in one of the crimes in the Zose district in today's paper, July 14, 29th year. Huierkang opened more than 20 years ago, with western food, tea and snacks for business, for people to rest, no dancing, and other improper business. Although your newspaper has published hearsay, it is important to influence the business of Huierkang, so please be a representative to prepare the letter statement, and please the newspaper to allow the letter to be corrected in the letter in order to avoid the false rumour and maintain business. Yours truly, Lawyer Sha Xunyis, July 15, 29th year.</p>

<h3>Price Stabilization Rice to be Implemented This Morning; Rice Industry Acknowledges Sufficient One-Tenthousand Tons and Has Ordered Via Telegram; Association Orders at 65 Yuan per Bag</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Public Settlement Municipal Council announced yesterday, "In accordance with the Shanghai Price Stabilization Rice Committee's decision to re-establish price stabilization points in the Public Settlement and French Concession starting July 16th, various rice shops have been entrusted to handle the issuance of tickets and rice sales from 7:00 AM to 10:00 AM daily. Each ticket sells for one yuan in legal tender, and each yuan can buy four market catties of rice. The rice shop is noted on the ticket, and the ticket holder can directly purchase from the respective rice shop. It is investigated that this kind of price stabilization is purely a charitable act, and it is intended to benefit people's lives. All rice purchasers must adhere to this aim, strictly abide by order, and not cause trouble. If there are unruly people who take the opportunity to cause trouble at the various rice shops, they will be immediately arrested and severely punished. This is hereby announced."</p>
<p>Ordered Rice in Transit</p>
<p>In order to suppress rice prices, the authorities in the two concessions specifically ordered the relevant groups in the rice industry to not only find ways to suppress rice prices but also to raise funds to order a large amount of foreign rice, transport it to Shanghai for storage, and prepare it for emergencies. Subsequently, the rice industry followed the order and established a small committee to persuade them to order foreign rice separately. After several days of contact, the full amount of one-tenthousand tons (i.e., 100,000 bags) has been acknowledged, and various foreign firms have been entrusted to send telegrams overseas to order them. A total of 7,500 tons were ordered from Saigon and 2,500 tons from Hong Kong. 3,000 tons of rice ordered from Saigon has started shipping from 14th of this month, and is due to arrive at port at the end of the month.</p>
<p>Group Purchases</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai People's Food Regulation Association revised the method of group ordering of foreign rice on the 1st of this month, the participation of various public groups has been extremely enthusiastic. As of the 9th, the foreign rice ordered by the association had exceeded 2,000 bags. Therefore, the first batch of more than 2,000 bags was ordered from Saigon on the 9th and will arrive in Shanghai by the middle of next month at the latest. The second batch of about 1,000 bags will also continue to be ordered within the next week. As for the price, it is 65 yuan per bag, but the freight and warehouse rent of two or three yuan per bag are not included. According to the person in charge, he told a reporter from Pingming News Agency yesterday that in order to avoid delaying time, the number of bags per batch has been reduced to 1,000 bags. (According to the original plan, each batch must have 2,000 bags before an order can be placed.)</p>
<h3>Municipal Council Police Chief Superintendent Letter of Thanks to the Shanghai Volunteer Corps</h3>

<p>Education News</p>
<h3>Implementation of National Education in Yunnan Province Included in the Five-Year Plan; Central Government to Subsidize 1.8 Million Yuan Annually; 300 Central Schools to Be Established in the First Year</h3>
<p>(Kunming Dispatch) Regarding the implementation of national education nationwide and the method of raising funds, the central and provincial governments will each raise 25%, while county and local levels will raise 50% themselves. The implementation plan for this province has been submitted to the Ministry of Education at the end of April.  A budget has been prepared according to the current living standards of the province, and the amount is quite large. A request has been submitted to the central government for subsidies according to the proposal. Furthermore, the Director of Education repeatedly telegraphed, clarifying that the provincial government and all sectors unanimously and enthusiastically support and promote the national construction plan. The province and counties are making every effort to raise funds, and a certain amount has already been achieved. It is hoped that the central government will consider the poverty and cultural backwardness of the border provinces and provide generous subsidies to expedite the implementation of universal education. The Department of Education received a reply from the Ministry of Education stating that the province's national education plan has been included in the national five-year plan. In the first year, approval has been granted to newly establish 300 central schools each and to renovate or newly establish 2,000 national schools each. The central government subsidy is listed as 1.61 million yuan, and the short-term supplementary training fee is 207,000 yuan. It is expected that the province will raise an equal amount of funds as reported, and the subsidies will be granted accordingly. It seems that the central government is determined to go all out to promote national education, which can be seen from this. The subsidy to this province has also been given preferentially. The responsibilities of government authorities at all levels in this province have been particularly increased. Especially in terms of raising additional funds, the province must raise an equal large amount itself, and each county must also raise its own full amount separately. In total, Yunnan Province must raise a total of 7,268,000 national currency this year (August 1940 to July 1941) in order to complete this unprecedented national construction plan and the foundation of self-government.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong YMCA Relieves Poor Students from Tsing Sai; University Students Can Apply for Travel Expenses; High School Seniors Can Apply for Tuition Fees</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong Dispatch) The Hong Kong YMCA Relief Student Committee's 14th registration for applications for travel expenses for poor students from Tsing Sai will begin on July 10th for a period of one month, ending on August 10th. The results will be announced after investigation and review by the association. The registration method is briefly described below: (1) Applicants must submit admission certificates and poverty certificates. (2) Three essays: A. The experience of being a refugee; B. Plans for completing studies; C. The War of Resistance, National Construction, and Youth. (3) Recent academic report cards. (4) One photo of the applicant. According to Zheng Dechao, the person in charge of the association, the regulations for granting this relief are quite strict. Only university students are eligible to apply for travel expenses, and only students above the third grade of high school are eligible to apply for tuition fees. Furthermore, they must have proof of admission and be unable to pay tuition fees due to the war. These points will be investigated in detail by the association. Those who go to the mainland will be given travel expenses as appropriate, but it must also be ascertained where they are going, where they can continue their studies, or whether they have relatives or friends who can provide assistance. This is because it is feared that even with assistance, they will not be able to study and will end up wandering in other places, which would go against the original intention of relieving poor students who are eager to learn. It is also learned that in the past, a total of 414 people have received relief from the association, with a total of 2,656 yuan in national currency and 11,701.46 Hong Kong dollars being issued for travel and tuition fees.</p>

<h3>Finance: Exchange Rate Fluctuations, US Dollar Rises and Falls Back</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market, HSBC listed prices remained unchanged.  The black market for British and US exchange rates was tight then eased, and after the US dollar broke through the six-yuan level, it fell back immediately, and the result was still flat. Initially, foreign firms had settlements, and Chinese firms and speculators bought in unison, causing it to continue to soften to only 5.84375 yuan. Unexpectedly, after 10:30, a strong atmosphere of peace again disturbed the market, and people were at least affected by it, causing Chinese banks to suddenly turn to selling, and Japanese banks also came to sell, about nearly 100,000 US dollars, and the price rose back. Moreover, in the afternoon, due to the fact that speculators had no shortage of positions to sell, the price became cheaper and cheaper. The US exchange rate fell out of the six-yuan level. Later, it was heard that there were not many transactions, and the changes were also reduced. The closing price was 3 shillings 9.0625 pence for British gold and 6 yuan for US exchange, which was slightly longer than the closing price last Saturday. British currency increased by 0.015625, US currency increased by 0.0625, and futures and spot prices were slightly squeezed open.</p>
<p>Morning Market Buying Trend Still Strong</p>
<p>In the early morning, the exchange rate of British currency against the US dollar did not move, and it was also flat against Shanghai currency, and there was no market for French currency. The US dollar fell by half against the British currency, did not move against Shanghai currency, and there was no market for French currency. The central government's listed exchange rates remained the same. Banks opened spot selling prices in the morning, with British gold at 3 shillings 8.90625 pence and US exchange at 5.96875 yuan, which was flat compared to the closing prices last Saturday for both British and US exchange rates. After opening, foreign firms first had an appetite, and the market already showed a soft state. It is estimated that Lucky and other foreign firms sold 7.84375 shillings to foreign firms for British gold in July, and 8.8125 shillings for British gold in August. The HSBC listed price was announced with no changes, and the silver balance tax was also announced with no increase or decrease. After that, Chinese firms and speculators settled near and far US exchange rates, and the price was still tight. The current US exchange rate even reached 5.84375 yuan, while Chinese firms and speculators entered US banks, foreign firms, and overseas positions, etc., 5.9375 and 875 yuan for US exchange in July, and 5.8125 yuan for US exchange in August. Later, Japanese banks came to the market to sell, and HSBC also intended to supply, and the market image turned loose, and it was rumored that the atmosphere of peace was affecting people's hearts. Chinese banks suddenly tended to sell, and it is estimated that Japanese banks sold 5.90625 and 9375 yuan for US exchange in July to foreign firms, and HSBC sold 5.90625 yuan for US exchange in the same month to Shanghai. Later, Chinese banks sold US exchange in the same month to as high as 5.9375 and 96875 yuan, and the closing trend was also loose, with British gold at 3 shillings 9.0625 pence and British exchange at 5.96875 yuan, which was slightly longer than the morning opening of British currency by 0.015625, while the US dollar had no honor or disgrace.</p>
<p>Speculative Selling Suddenly Surges</p>
<p>The situation in the afternoon was still quiet, but due to the selling by speculators, the market price rose, and the US exchange rate has gone outside the six-yuan level. It is estimated that foreign firms entered the speculator's US exchange this month at 6.03125 yuan, and later transactions were less, lacking changes. As a result, British gold was 3 shillings 9.0625 pence, US exchange was 6 yuan, the same price as this month's and spot prices, and British gold in August was 3 shillings 8.4375 pence, and US exchange was 5.9375 yuan, which was longer than the closing price last weekend by 0.015625, the US currency increased by 0.0625, August British currency was flat, and the US dollar was loose by 0.03125.</p>

<h3>Atmosphere of Peace: Gold Market Setbacks Still Minor</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cash gold black market rose and then suddenly fell back, and people's hearts were unstable, and there were many follow-up buyers and sellers. The morning's fierce jump opened from 5,500 yuan and rose to 5,560 yuan, but the exchange market reported tight, and then there was an atmosphere of Sino-Japanese peace that both Britain and Germany would mediate, and there were many people with nervous hearts who resold, and foreign exchange also immediately reported hardening. At that time, a certain gold company sold the most, falling to 5,380 yuan, and the noon closing was only 5,395 yuan. The later market was more and more tired, and after opening at 5,390 yuan, it fell to 5,350 yuan with the help of retail investors and silver houses, but the gold company's short positions were covered before the close, pulling up 60 to 70 yuan, and finally closing at 5,380 yuan, which was 30 yuan lower than the closing price last Saturday. The total transaction volume was still strong, about 3,000 taels or so, and the silver building jewelry gold finally hung down by 10 yuan, and customs gold remained flat.</p>
<p>Gold Falls 30 Yuan</p>
<p>Since the morning, each bar (ten taels), initially because the foreign exchange was quite tight, and people's hearts were firm, the market opened with a crazy increase of 85 yuan, and the gold company entered 20 taels from the silver house, for 5,500 yuan. Although the silver house slightly vomited, it had a slight setback of 10 yuan. After all, the foreign exchange at that time was still reported soft, and the silver house helped to tend to cover the short positions, and new buyers soon stirred up dozens of yuan, and the silver house entered 20 taels from the money exchange industry, rising to 5,560 yuan. However, after this, the number of buyers suddenly decreased, and a certain gold company violently threw out, and more retail investors saw the scene and sold off, so it fell back 100 yuan, and the silver house sold 10 taels to the gold company, retreating to 5,460 yuan. Then, relying on the securities help to slightly climb in, and at that time, the money exchange industry's appetite was also good, it rose back 50 yuan, and the gold company did 20 taels, for 5,510 yuan. Taking into account that the foreign exchange was still in a loose trend, a certain gold company once again violently sold off, and there was a certain kind of negative news in the market, so it once again caused more retail investors to vomit out, and soon it was re-seen to return small by 130 yuan, and the silver house sold 30 taels to the gold company, for 5,380 yuan. Later, the silver house sold 10 taels to the silver building, for 5,395 yuan, as the noon closing price. The situation was still inferior in the early afternoon, and the opening was slightly pressed by 5 yuan, to 5,380 yuan. Later, the silver house and more retail investors vomited out, and it was re-seen to do small by 40 yuan, and the silver house sold 30 taels of money to the money exchange industry, for 5,350 yuan. After entering, a certain gold company's short covering was extremely strong, pulling up 70 yuan, and a certain gold company entered 30 taels from the silver house, for 5,420 yuan. Before the close, a certain money exchange industry came to vomit out again, and it could no longer support it. The silver houses did 30 taels with each other, for 5,380 yuan as the evening closing price. As a result, it was smaller by 30 yuan compared to the previous day, and the whole day rose and fell by 210 yuan. The cash gold company's own brand gold sold out was more than 10 yuan higher than the cooked red, and the purchase reduction was 30 yuan. The current bid gold was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there was little to no activity.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Hangs Small 10 Yuan</p>
<p>The initial sale of jewelry gold per tael, Da Tong Hang still hung at 560 yuan, and at ten o'clock, it hung 10 yuan higher, and at 10:30, it returned small by 10 yuan, and at 12:35, it was small by 10 yuan. There were no changes after this, and as a result, it squeezed small by 10 yuan. It is estimated that Da Tong Hang changed to hang 550 yuan, and the new Hang Tong Hang was the same as the upper price, and the purchase reduction was about 30 yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currencies Rise and Fall Like Rabbits and Hawks</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market, after the cooked red rose, it suddenly fell, and British and US gold pounds also rose first and then fell, and finally fell by one yuan each. The supply and demand of British gold bills were even, and the market price stood flat. The US gold bill initially rose to 17.07 yuan, and then suddenly rumors about Sino-Japanese peace revived, and people's hearts were not without stimulation, so that all parties supplied extraordinarily diligently, and the price retreated to 16.6 yuan at noon. In the afternoon, it once rose to 16.72 yuan, and finally retreated to 16.55 yuan, which was 0.2 yuan lower than last Saturday. The Hong Kong bill, however, was in strong demand due to the rising trend of the Hong Kong-Shanghai exchange rate, and the evening market rose to 3.77 yuan, which was 0.02 yuan higher than last Saturday. Canadian bills and Philippine bills were not lacking in supply, and the market prices all tended to be tired. Japanese remaining bills and Korean bills were in extraordinarily strong demand, and the market prices all soared, the former rising to 1.24 yuan and the latter rising to 1.05 yuan.</p>
<h3>Securities Rumors Favorable to Bulls, Domestic Debt Rises Sharply in Afternoon</h3>
<p>The securities black market suddenly rose in the afternoon yesterday. There were rumors in the market that there was again an atmosphere of peace, and that Britain had given up the Far East, and it was seen in the evening newspapers. Although it was inevitable that it was too early to pass on, the price of gold fell as a result, and the public debt suddenly rose. It can be seen that there are too many gold bulls and too many public debt shorts. After the public debt market rose, it attracted more bulls to come out, and the market price still had a dazed and uncertain image. If there are no other unexpected attacks in the market situation, the current price may be temporarily established. Trading was flat yesterday morning. Da Feng and No. 22 bought in, and Yi Tai and No. 16 sold out, and the market price had almost no rise or fall. Rumors suddenly rose in the afternoon, stirring up general floating space to cover, Type A broke out of 62 yuan, Type B broke out of 3 yuan, and Type C rushed out of 1 yuan. The market price was quite good. In the middle, due to the fact that many parties once came out, they returned small by about 0.2 yuan. Soon they still proceeded to lift up, and the buying momentum of various gangs suddenly increased. Da Feng continued to buy in, and Xie Da Ren Chang Shun Heng Le Mao and No. 11 all had considerable recoveries. No. 16 continued to sell, and Lian He Hong Da Tong Shun Tong Kang all had sales, and the market price was low and then high, because the retail investors' appetite was also very enthusiastic. As a result of the day, all rose, and it is estimated that it ranged from 0.2 yuan to 0.55 yuan. The total number of transactions was more than 900,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock trading, 200 shares of Silk Industry Bank shares were traded at a price of 24.5 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday's stock market opening at the Public Industry Office, as expected by the general public, the trend was extremely firm and rising. Within the first hour, the buying momentum was great, and the stocks listed in the market list almost all rose according to the list, and even some rose more than 20% compared to the closing price last week. The wind of profit-taking and settlement suddenly rose, and most of the sellers were satiated with the purchases made last week and settled them. The operators who are convinced that there is an upward grasp of the goods received have different messages. The reasons for the rebound at the close are difficult to say for sure. The day's trading was extremely large, and the market was in a state of flux. When the price rebounded, buyers surged in, so it is difficult to say at this moment whether this fleeting prosperity has come to an end.</p>
<h3>Grain: More Than 50,000 Bags of Foreign Rice Continue to Arrive; Saigon No. 1 Enters the 60 Yuan Level; Down 8-9 Yuan from the Highest Price</h3>
<p>After the rice market once rose slightly before last week and returned to flat, it presented a sharp decline yesterday. The large number of foreign rice en route that successively arrived caused people's hearts to collapse. The route to the countryside in the mainland was stagnant, and the buying momentum of the store appetite on this street also declined. In an instant in the early market, the prices of various foreign rice fell by more than one yuan. After that, they continued to fall straight all the way, without any turning point. As a result, the closing price of No. 1 Chen Saigon had fallen into the 60 yuan level, only 58.5 yuan, No. 2 56 yuan, 55.5 yuan, No. 1 Siam 58 yuan, No. 2 55.6 yuan, 55 yuan, Fire Twisted 57 yuan, 56.5 yuan, Hong Kong Sharp 56.5 yuan to 55.4 yuan, Small Twisted 56 yuan, 55.5 yuan, Tokyo Broken Sharp 51.5 yuan, the next one 49.5 yuan, Broken Sharp Special From 42.5 yuan, the next one is similar to Qi 38 yuan, Rice Lu 456 yuan, which is more than 2 yuan lower than the closing price before last week. In terms of period rice, the road goods packed on the 20th and 26th are also expected to arrive on the day. Therefore, after the application for the market opening price, the market conditions immediately declined in the lively selling sound. Especially the devaluation of road goods is the most. The opening price for the 26th was 67 yuan, which was 1.5 yuan less than last Saturday. Then, from 65.5 yuan to 65 yuan, there was a shout of 64.5 yuan for immediate delivery. The 20th installation opened at 65.1 yuan, which was a huge fall of 3.45 yuan compared to last Saturday. Now, although foreign rice is sold in the early market, since the transshipment and the mainland have been obstructed, and the flat rice is opened on the same day, the market price has also fallen by 2 yuan in the weak and sluggish real consumption. Now, only 3,000 bags are consumed, and 300 tons of road goods are consumed.</p>
<p>A large amount of foreign rice arrived in Shanghai again yesterday. Yih Ho Foreign Company's Mingsheng Wheel brought 4,000 bags from Haiphong and 15,863 bags from Hong Kong, and stopped at Roosevelt Wharf for unloading. Taikoo Company's Chongqing Wheel transported 17,142 bags from Hong Kong, and Jinan Wheel also brought 19,183 bags from Hong Kong, and both wheels stopped at the company's wharf in Pudong for unloading. Yesterday, a total of 56,188 bags of foreign rice arrived.</p>
<p>Although the arrival of glutinous rice is lacking, the market is depressed, and the sales market is also stagnant, so the owners have no intention of holding on, and the selling prices have all been reduced by 2 yuan. The special opening price for Jin Li and Te Yuan was 64 yuan, the market for big cities was 63 yuan, the Chang Dan Bai Yuan was 612 yuan, and the Hong Kong Bai Yuan was 634 yuan.</p>
<p>The source of domestic rice such as thick and thin japonica is limited, only 600-700 bags. How can foreign rice be sold off again and again, and the rumors of black market transactions outside the market have all been eclipsed. Since there is little to no activity, the price has also continued to depreciate by 1-2 yuan. Changbang Special Japonica has entered the 70 yuan level, only 689 yuan, Su Kun Changzhou White Japonica is high from 667 yuan, and the next one is Su 645 yuan, Qing Si Thin Rice 678 yuan, Nangang Early Rice 656 yuan, and it will reach 634 yuan.</p>
<h3>Chinese Flour Mill Plate Increases Price; Opens at 16 Yuan Per Bag</h3>
<p>Flour: Yesterday, Chinese flour mills such as Fuxin and Fufeng factories had resumed production and were supplying as usual. However, the No. 2 flour mill plate has risen to 16 yuan, which is a sharp increase of 80 cents compared to before. The Chinese factory flour that has been brewing for many days ended with a price increase. Since the factory plate has reached 16 yuan, the real sales on this street may not be prosperous, creating an opportunity for the dumping of foreign flour. It is heard that the Muke side continued to purchase more than 10,000 bags of foreign flour such as foreign fort and horse brand foreign flour, and the price was US$3.70, and the combined bag was also equal to the Chinese flour. Its quality is better, so buyers are happy to buy it. The prices of other Japanese factory flour and inland flour are flat and tired, and transactions are also 3,400 bags.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday, the source of new wheat was about 10,000 bags, all of which were unloaded in Hongkou. In addition to a part directly distributed to Japanese factories, Chinese factories also purchased in retail, and the price was higher than that of Japanese factories. Because of the current environment, Chinese factories cannot easily purchase without lowering the price. It is heard that the purchase price of Fufu factories is 23.5 to 24 yuan, and there is no formal activity in the market.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Refrigerator Flower Green Sees New High Price</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend was stable. The guild's allocated plate for 24 coarse white was 68.1 to 68 yuan at the main station, with little rise or fall. Foreign station goods were not traded. The transfer goods are currently trading at 53.6 yuan per station list, up 30 cents. The delivery on the 22nd initially rose 60 cents to 54.2 yuan, but then returned to 53.6 yuan. Taikoo Car White B mark West Station 78 yuan, East Station 77.5 yuan, Dutch Red 58 yuan, 100 bags of Hong Kong gang's front to ice flower green were once called 75 yuan but did not succeed. Yesterday, they opened at 73 yuan, which is also a new record. The day before yesterday (14th), 3,125 bags of Taikoo Car Sugar were transported from Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn: Chinese vs. Japanese Yarn, Differing Fortunes</h3>
<p>The yarn market is stable, with a steady trend and a slight upward wind. This is because demand for coarse and fine yarn continues unabated in the South China area. Therefore, the bullish sentiment is calm, and some are taking a strategy of selling high and buying low, resulting in a tranquil situation. However, Japanese yarn remains in a slump and unable to rise. The situations differ, partly because Hong Kong merchants have healthy sales channels, and partly because the avenues are narrow.</p>
<p>The spot yarn market opened rather flat this morning. 20-count "Double Horse" yarn opened at 1,020 yuan, falling to 1,018 yuan. This price hovered for quite some time, before news of eager purchasing by Guangdong merchants boosted morale. Buyers in the market became slightly more interested, and the price rose to 1,030 yuan at closing. It is estimated that 1,825 bales were traded in half a day. Transactions for 20-count "Double Horse" yarn quietly increased by 19 yuan. Yesterday, 60 bales of cotton yarn arrived in Xiamen. The amounts purchased by each group are listed below:</p>
<p>Fellow Traders: 830, Hong Kong: 810, Ningbo: 135, Mainland: 5, Xiamen: 45, Total: 1,825</p>
<h3>Chinese Factories Begin Purchasing, Cotton Market Turns Around</h3>
<p>Spot cotton trading is slightly more active, with a more bullish momentum. However, Japanese factories are notably inactive and show no signs of purchasing. The market is somewhat better due to healthier demand from Chinese factories and fellow traders. The spot cotton transaction details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Argentine, 228.00, Purchased by Shen Er Factory, 30 bales</p>
<p>Mitterling, 280.00, Purchased by Xin Yu, 100 bales</p>
<p>Tongzhou, 172.00, Purchased by Fellow Traders, 200 bales</p>
<p>Tongzhou, 175.00, Purchased by Qing Xiang, 200 bales</p>
<p>Additional news on foreign cotton market prices: In the New York cotton market, the market situation was very quiet yesterday. Later, due to selling by spot merchants and profit-taking by some bulls, closing prices increased by 4-5 points for near-term contracts and decreased slightly by 1-2 points for distant contracts. The Indian market situation is very firm. Yesterday, including forecasts, it rose another 4-5 rupees.</p>
<p>The Shanghai foreign cotton trade has become increasingly lively in recent days. Chinese factories have also begun purchasing, and traders are particularly excited. There are many transactions. Market inventories are becoming scarce, so all parties believe that cotton prices are about to rise.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains: Soybean Cakes Surge with Rain</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the soybean cake market surged because of a rain shower the previous night. Speculators revived, and demand from various quarters increased, causing prices to rise sharply. Qingzhong cakes, in particular, rose sharply, increasing by 1.20 yuan compared to last weekend. Other cakes also rose sharply by 60-70 cents. It is estimated that Xinghua, Quanzhou, Shantou, and inland merchants traded 15,000 pieces of Four-Brand factory cakes at 13.20 yuan, 3,000 pieces of Sheng Ji cakes at 12 yuan, 4,000 pieces of Qingzhong cakes at prices ranging from 10.70 to 11.10 yuan, two carloads of Yuan Long cakes at 11.70 yuan, two carloads of Fei Zi cakes at 11.67 yuan, and 1,000 pieces of Chang Ji cakes at 11.30 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 1,630 bags of soybeans were shipped to Xiamen and 165 bags to Singapore. Also, 8,200 pieces of soybean cakes, 1,550 cans of raw oil, and 6 packages of tea were shipped to Xiamen, and 25 packages of tea to Singapore.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods and Dyeing Sales Active, Cloth Factories Resume Night Work</h3>
<p>Domestic Cloth: The cloth market continued to be strong yesterday due to sustained actual sales. Speculators absorbed supplies aggressively, and sentiment turned bullish. Factories that had suspended operations resumed night shifts. Prices for coarse cloth and twill increased by 2.5 to 5 cents per piece, and dyed cloth increased by about 5 cents. Transactions were most active on this street, with over 300 bales of coarse cloth and twill and over 200 bales of dyed cloth. Shipments from Guangzhou Bay are gradually increasing. Guangdong and Hong Kong merchants added nearly 200 bales of colored fine cloth and twill, and Wen and Yong merchants purchased several hundred bales of coarse cloth, fine cloth, and colored cloth.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: Market sentiment continued to rise, mainly because dyeing sales in this street became slightly more active yesterday. Transactions included over 500 bales of medium-grade fine cloth, with prices increasing by 2.5 cents per piece. "Dragon Head" fine cloth also continued to be firm, starting from 30.12 yuan and closing at 30.075 yuan in the afternoon. "Four Gentlemen" serge sold for 9.075 cents per yard.</p>
<p>Import/Export: The day before yesterday (14th), 120 bales of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong. Today, 55 bales were shipped to Xiamen and 6 bales to Singapore.</p>
<h3>Coal: Bituminous Coal Dust Sells Well</h3>
<p>Since the bituminous coal dust market weakened and prices were cut, the market situation has gradually turned around, attracting purchases from street vendors. Market sentiment has slightly hardened. It is estimated that transactions among traders have resulted in Kaiping No. 1 dust being priced at 190 yuan per ton, No. 2 dust at 170 yuan, and Keelung dust at 150 yuan. The above prices are for delivery from the warehouse, with an additional commission added for delivery to the customer.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Japanese Silk Recovers, Local Silk Transactions Stalled</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Yokohama spot silk was 1,350 yuan, the same as the previous market. Near-term was 1,396 yuan, up 6 yuan, and distant-term was 1,387 yuan, up 8 yuan. Overseas silk prices fluctuated in the middle. The British sector has been weak for weeks, and the current situation remains the same. Shanghai silk prices have been in a stalemate since white filature was sold for 4,900 yuan per picul. In short, the Shanghai silk market is not free to absorb or release. Silk prices rise and fall abruptly, making it difficult to find a regular pattern. The future trend will depend on the development of the situation.</p>
<h3>Local Black Tea Sales Improve in Germany</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign tea market was not deserted. Sales of coarse black tea to Germany were good. However, because traders limited their purchasing prices, market inventories were low, making it difficult to expect significant development in the market. As for green tea sales, only American merchants made some sporadic purchases of Phoenix Eyebrow and Pearl tea. The entire market saw the following purchases by Tongfu, Jinlong, Xingcheng, Xiehe, and other firms: over 530 boxes of red and green tea, with Pearl tea selling for 250-280 yuan and Phoenix Eyebrow tea selling for 270 yuan. Black tea sold for 240-250 yuan. The situation is better for black tea than for green tea. The day before yesterday, 60 packages of tea were shipped from Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Wang Jin Pure Antimony Continues to Rise Due to Shortage</h3>
<p>Since transportation from Hunan for domestic pure antimony was disrupted, local spot goods have become increasingly scarce, and prices have continued to soar. It is found that only one or two hardware stores in the market hold this commodity, so the standard asking price has become monopolized. The price has increased sharply from 7,500-7,600 yuan per picul to around 7,800 yuan. However, there are no large purchases from this street or guest merchants, only a few inquiries. It is said that a batch of spot goods is coming from Hong Kong, but it is also said to be an order for a certain firm.</p>
<h3>Steel Plate Market Slightly Loosens</h3>
<p>The ship steel plate market has weakened due to sluggish sales. Yesterday, traders in the market had little activity, and the market situation was bleak. Standard market prices have fallen slightly. Currently, 2.5 mm is quoted at 83 yuan, 5 mm is sold at 64 yuan, 7.5 mm and 10 mm are quoted at 59 yuan, 15 mm and 20 mm are quoted at 57 yuan, 25 mm is sold at 56 yuan, and 40 mm is 57 yuan. All are down 1-2 yuan compared to the previous market. Only a few dozen dan were traded.</p>
<h3>Statistics: Price Changes – May – (6)</h3>

<h3>Old News Re-Copied: 67 Years Ago (446) (See this newspaper from the 12th year of the Tongzhi reign of the Qing Dynasty)</h3>
<p>Several Poems</p>
<p>(Poem on Wandering as an Immortal) I love to build my hut by Jian Lake, Admiring the ancient traces of Ji Zhen; I gather pine firewood to cook white stones, Immortals are neither rich nor poor. I bought ten acres of fields on Mount Lao, Eating rice and bathing in the sandy spring; Woodcutters do not understand the practice of immortality, Mistaking Rong Cheng for a young man. Old trees are densely packed by the hundred thousand, A solitary hermitage is deep in the white clouds; The sky is the curtain, the red sun is clear and without heat, I beg for the Six Gui Talisman of the immortals. The water curtain is a thousand feet, suddenly like thunder, Mist rises from Mount Kuanglu, The mountain does not open; I want to visit the monks of the Six Dynasties to talk, But they have not returned from gathering medicine on Stone Bridge. (Night Mooring at Gusu) The scenery is not my own, The sound of the water clock is late where there are many tourists; Pale yellow willows in the hazy moonlight, It is the time when the wine is dispersed from Shantang. Buildings stand in layers with myriad shadows, The lakes and mountains have not changed their old appearance; A river of fishing lights with half the moon, Only missing the bell from Hanshan Temple. (Letter to a Friend) Willow branches slant where the spring breeze is plentiful, Swallows nest in front of the building in the drizzling rain; I hate the shadow of the bright moon in Jiangnan, It secretly shines on the green peach blossoms late at night. The plum wind brings morning warblers singing day after day, Incense ash extinguishes as the curtain opens, falling swallow mud; If I don't look at the mountain scenery for three days, Wildflowers are redder than the stone bridge west. (Feeling from Hearing Frogs) Suddenly I hear frogs croaking in the desolate fields, Countless ponds surround painted buildings. The moon shines brightly on both banks of the green grass crossing, After a rain, the green sandbar appears. They hide in the bottom of the well, still plotting to dominate, And prepare to take revenge by the carriage. Regardless of official or private matters, Their clamor adds to my sorrow. (New Official) Twenty years of vicissitudes, After experiencing hardships, my luck gradually improved; Earning an official position is truly worth writing about, The world adds another kowtowing worm.</p>

<h3>Jesus is the Savior of the Whole World</h3>
<p>Jesus Christ was born to establish the Kingdom of Heaven, to bring about universal harmony, mutual aid among mankind, and the eternal removal of national boundaries, racial and class barriers, so that mankind would be as brothers and sisters, and the world as one family, turning weapons into ploughshares. Therefore, Jesus is indeed the Savior of the whole world. In this ever-changing world history, mankind has repeatedly tried to transform the world, resolve disputes, and maintain order, in order to achieve a golden age; unfortunately, methods of self-salvation have repeatedly failed! That noble civilization and amazing science have instead increased human suffering; personal, national, and international injustices are visible everywhere; disease and death are constant companions; and all aspects of life, whether economic, social, moral, or religious, have generated major problems that we cannot solve; hatred, suspicion, and revenge continue endlessly; and cruel wars, piling up corpses like mountains and rivers of blood, cannot be avoided. God has long known that mankind cannot save itself, so He sent His Son (Jesus) to save us, but unfortunately, the world is unwilling to receive Him. Jesus is the "Prince of Peace," and "of the increase of His government and peace there will be no end." He comes to "wipe away every tear from their eyes, and there will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain." Only He is "King of Kings and Lord of Lords," the hope of the world. The Samaritans once testified about Jesus, saying, "We have heard for ourselves, and we know that this is indeed the Savior of the world!"</p>
<p>At that time, the Jewish governor Pilate took a sign and wrote a title in three languages—Hebrew, Greek, and Latin—and placed it on the cross where Jesus was to be crucified. It read: "Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews." It was not Pilate who wrote this, but God secretly instructed it, clearly announcing to the whole world that Jesus crucified on the cross was the King of the Jews, the Messiah longed for by generations, the one and only great Savior of the world. He deliberately used the languages of three countries to let everyone know that the intention behind it was very mysterious; Hebrew represented religion, Greek represented culture, and Roman represented politics; indicating that Jesus is the Savior of religion, culture, and politics. He is the King of religion, and He will carry out salvation to the ends of the earth. He is the King of culture, and all philosophy, science, and art have truth, beauty, and goodness because of Him. He is also the King of governance, because He is originally the Lord of all and King of Kings. Only when He comes to the world can there be universal harmony. Although we have not yet seen all things subject to Him, He has already been lifted up on the cross and will surely draw all people to Himself. May we all rise up and welcome Jesus, for He alone is the one and only Savior of the whole world!</p>

<h3>The Pain of Children</h3>
<p>— Editor</p>
<p>This is a reader's letter:</p>
<p>Editor of Free Talk:</p>
<p>After reading the two articles "To a Woman Who Wants to Commit Suicide" and "To a Father" on Free Talk on July 11, I was deeply sympathetic to the woman's fate. I couldn't help but think that there are too many such families. How many young men and women either go astray or are suffocated by hardship. "At the beginning of humanity, people are inherently good," but parents not only fail to fulfill their responsibility to educate, not leading their children into the path of light, but instead harm them wantonly? When the children grow up, they add a cry of "ungrateful son/daughter"—the children are too miserable. All of this is because parents have not recognized "themselves" and "the family," neither knowing how to be parents nor being able to be parents.</p>
<p>Therefore, I hope that your publication can publish articles on mental health, family education, and parental self-cultivation to awaken people to not neglect family education and the psychology of children, to shoulder the responsibilities of being parents, in order to reduce the suffering of the younger generation. Sincerely wish you</p>
<p>Editorial Peace, Zhi Da respectfully</p>
<p>We are willing to accept Mr. Zhi Da's suggestion to discuss issues related to family education and mental hygiene in Free Talk. Because these issues are directly related to individuals and families, and indirectly related to society and the nation, they are closely intertwined. We feel that exploring these issues should be based on the perspective of psychology. We welcome readers to raise questions and also welcome readers' criticisms and suggestions.</p>

<h3>The Utilization of Atomic Energy</h3>
<p>— Mo Ming</p>
<p>The successful splitting of the uranium atom is the most important new discovery in the scientific community in recent years, and the utilization of atomic energy is the most novel and beautiful dream of today's scientists.</p>
<p>Atoms are the "bricks of the universe," the unit particles that make up all matter, but these unimaginably small particles also have their own complex structures. Each atom has a core at its center, surrounded by electrons, just like "stars surrounding the moon." The atomic nucleus also has varying numbers of neutrons and protons. These neutrons and protons are all active and restless fellows, but they are now tightly confined to an extraordinarily narrow range by an incredible force. This force is very mysterious and great, but when a strong external force, such as a high-speed neutron, bombards the atomic nucleus and causes it to split, a part of this binding force is released, generating the so-called amazing atomic energy. The greater the weight of the atom, the more particles confined in its nucleus, and the greater the energy generated during splitting. Uranium is the heaviest of the ninety-two chemical elements—atomic weight 238.</p>
<p>Each uranium atom releases approximately 200 million electron volts of energy during splitting. An electron volt is a unit in physics that is difficult to explain or describe in simple terms. Therefore, to understand the magnitude of the number "200 million electron volts," we must use a comparative method: each carbon atom releases approximately four electron volts of energy when it burns, and the most powerful explosive T.N.T. of mankind releases no more than five electron volts per molecule when it explodes. So if we use coal to represent carbon, then the kinetic energy generated by a uranium atom is five million times that of the same amount of coal. No wonder scientists dream of using eight pounds of uranium to power the Queen Mary across the Atlantic!</p>
<p>When a uranium atom splits, it also leaves behind some "fragments," or emits free neutrons. These neutrons are like horses that have escaped their reins, full of energy. When they bombard another uranium atom nearby, they can also cause the atomic nucleus to burst, releasing energy again and emitting neutrons again. If this chain reaction is carried out one after another, the generation of atomic energy can be automatically maintained and promoted. This phenomenon, which scientists call a "chain reaction," can truly be said to be a gift from heaven. Otherwise, when using atomic energy, we would have to continuously break atomic nuclei one by one, which would not only be cumbersome but also extremely uneconomical. But the problem is not so simple. There are three isotopes of the uranium atom, with atomic weights of 238, 235 (the so-called isotopes). According to experimental results, only "uranium 235" is most suitable for "chain reactions." Unfortunately, "uranium 235" happens to be the rarest, accounting for less than one percent of the natural uranium element. Therefore, the current method of separating and concentrating this rare element has become the focus of scientific research. This research is proceeding very slowly, arduously, and expensively. Although we use the most advanced physicists and the most modern and sophisticated equipment to explore it, the results are still pitifully dismal: only one hundred trillionth of a pound of "uranium 235" can be separated per hour. According to this calculation, we would have to wait a million years to accumulate one pound of atomic energy fuel, which is too ridiculous. However, according to recent news from Sweden, a scientist has been able to increase the speed of separating "uranium 235" by more than eleven thousand times using a unique new method. From this, it can be seen that scientific progress is advancing rapidly, and although the goal is distant, the distance is shortening day by day. Recently, the famous American inventor Gano Dunn predicted that the utilization of atomic energy will be realized in the next twenty years, and it may even be accelerated within ten years. This means that in the next ten to twenty years, our world will undergo great changes due to the utilization of atomic energy. Let us wait and see with excitement and full of hope!</p>
<p>The Case of Huo Sang</p>
<h3>The Dancer's End</h3>
<p>— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter 3: Conflicting Information</p>
<p>Old Mao lowered his voice again and replied: "She has stayed out for two nights in the past two weeks. The first night—I can't remember the exact date, probably more than a week ago?—was uneventful. Miss Wang came back at nine o'clock in the morning and, of course, didn't tell us where she had spent the night. But we had already guessed eight or nine points, because this Zhao Boxiong is stirring things up with her like a fire." He licked his lips and wiped his forehead with his hand.</p>
<p>"But the second time wasn't so peaceful." He continued, then suddenly stopped.</p>
<p>Huo Sang urged him, "How was it not peaceful? Speak quickly."</p>
<p>Old Mao suddenly took a step closer and bent his back slightly. "This time it almost got ugly! That day—let me think, it was the day before yesterday, the sixteenth, Friday night, she was out all night again. Then, at eight o'clock in the morning on the seventeenth, Manager Lu suddenly called. When he heard that Miss Wang wasn't there, he got angry."</p>
<p>Huo Sang suddenly stopped him and said, "Wait, who answered the phone?"</p>
<p>Old Mao said, "Jinmei answered it. But I was sweeping the floor here, and I heard it very clearly. Jinmei even made up an excuse, but it didn't work."</p>
<p>"Made up an excuse? What excuse?"</p>
<p>"Jinmei first replied that Miss Wang hadn't gotten up yet. But Manager Lu insisted on talking to Miss Wang, so Jinmei pretended to go upstairs to wake her up. After a while, she replied that she couldn't wake her up. Manager Lu clearly became more suspicious and insisted that she speak to him. Jinmei was forced to tell the truth, so the excuse backfired."</p>
<p>"What happened afterward?"</p>
<p>"Around eight fifteen, Manager Lu rushed over in a huff, but Miss Wang still hadn't returned. We were all worried. Fortunately, Manager Lu didn't go upstairs, and then there was the sound of a car. Miss Wang came back. Then the two of them met, and he started making a fuss in this room."</p>
<p>"How? Did you hear anything?"</p>
<p>Old Mao shook his head, "I didn't hear very clearly, just a sentence or two. Manager Lu said something like, 'You've let me down too much... It must be that Zhao scoundrel... I could tell he wasn't on the right path in the movie theater that day.' After hearing these words, I was naturally clear in my mind. Manager Lu certainly wouldn't wrong her—"</p>
<h3>Two Appendixes</h3>
<p>— Ou Li</p>
<p>The doctor was already asleep, having sweet dreams, when he was suddenly awakened by the ringing of the telephone. The caller was a familiar patient, speaking urgently, "Doctor, come quickly, my wife has appendicitis."</p>
<p>The doctor sighed and told the man not to make a fuss and to go back to sleep peacefully. He said, "Just let her drink something, and I'll come to see her tomorrow. She doesn't have an appendix."</p>
<p>The husband became more anxious and insisted that she did have an appendix. The doctor said loudly, "She can't have one, I removed her appendix three years ago. I've never heard of anyone having two appendixes."</p>
<p>The husband finally explained, "Have you ever heard of someone having two wives?" The doctor suddenly understood and hurried out. Fortunately, he went early, because that second wife really did have appendicitis!</p>
<p>Publishing</p>
<h3>A Failed Person</h3>
<p>— Hua Zhi</p>
<p>The liveliness of the American publishing industry is well known throughout the world. Taking biographies as an example, at least five or six hundred types are published each year, the content of which is nothing more than the success stories of well-known people in society. However, in addition to many "Success Stories," there are also several "Failure Stories" published this year.</p>
<p>This is quite a novel approach.</p>
<p>Because a person struggles and achieves success, and it is recorded in a book, it becomes a landmark event after a certain number of years, and it is generally not easy to imitate casually; on the other hand, some people undergo various adventures and struggles, but in the end do not succeed. The reasons for their failure can be used as lessons for others, and they can try again and work harder. As the saying goes, "Things in life are often unsatisfactory in eight or nine cases out of ten." The encouragement given by those who fail exceeds that given by those who succeed.</p>
<p>Among these "Failure Stories," some are about industrialists and financiers from the era of economic decline in the United States. They all have a certain status in society now, but they did not reveal the reasons for their success, only the secrets of their failure.</p>

<h3>Regarding The Four Scholars</h3>
<p>— Qin Pi</p>
<p>"The Four Scholars" is one of the group operas, including roles for male, female, painted-face, old male, and clown characters. In terms of performance, all are seen as important, and the plot is quite wonderful. It exposes the malpractices that have been difficult to avoid in our country's judicial circles for hundreds or even thousands of years, the so-called "with wealth and power, filing a lawsuit is no problem," while the weak and helpless, ultimately wronged, also find it difficult to obtain redress. Throughout the ages, it is unknown how many wronged souls have sunk to the bottom of the sea.</p>
<p>However, the structure of Peking Opera is "reunion," and "The Four Scholars" cannot escape this exception. The playwright depicts Song Shijie's righteous rescue of the weak woman, which can be described as vivid and incisive. The entire play, from beginning to end, captures the audience's tense emotions! It is indeed a rare and good play.</p>
<p>I feel that the acting of the protagonist Song Shijie is extremely difficult. In addition to singing, reciting, and acting all requiring excellence, the actor must reach a considerable age to have the necessary skills; otherwise, even with a good voice, it is difficult to please the audience. Looking around the Peking Opera world today, only Ma Lianliang and Zhou Xinfang are qualified for this role. Last month, Lianliang went south and posted "The Four Scholars" on the second evening of his performance. Subsequently, he performed it twice more. Because I admired Zhou Xinfang's "The Four Scholars" for its "dragon-like roar and tiger-like howl" and "vivid depiction," which made people never tire of watching it, I concentrated and went to appreciate Ma's style. The special point of Ma's style is the addition of two scenes: before writing the indictment in Willow Forest, there is an extra scene of planning harm; after the second court hearing, there is an extra scene of suffering in prison. Whether these two scenes should be added is not worth discussing.</p>
<p>As for Zhou Xinfang's "The Four Scholars," the most important thing is "acting," which is deeply moving. Some people say: Xinfang's opera has a large audience. This is true, but the vast majority of the audience are not from the bourgeoisie. Most of them use hard-earned money to find pleasure in hardship and appreciate true art. Xinfang has been performing alone for many years, repeatedly posting this play, and it is often full, which is truly commendable! To say that "The Four Scholars" is the supreme masterpiece of the Qi School is the fairest comment.</p>
<h3>"Princess Iron Fan" Officially Begins Filming</h3>
<p>— Taigong</p>
<p>The Wan brothers are collaborating with "Guolian" to produce the full-length cartoon "Princess Iron Fan." Since the work began two months ago, the entire "Princess Iron Fan" has now been drawn and officially started filming. The Wan brothers' privately owned "cartoon automatic filming machine" has been transported to Dingxiang Garden. According to the Wan brothers, the machine was purchased from an American five or six years ago. In China, it can be said that there is only one such machine. The parts are very complex, and the machine itself is extremely large, occupying more than twenty feet of land. The upper part of the machine is equipped with a filming camera, which can automatically film. The steel frame is more than two zhang long and can be freely moved up, down, left, and right to distinguish between distant and close views. Above the filming camera, there is a round shaft that can be freely rotated during filming. There are four layers of lights to distinguish between strong and weak. The scenery can also be divided into four layers. During filming, four or five photographers are required to manage the machine. Just by pressing the switch, the filming camera can automatically film the drawings one by one. The directors are Wan Laiming and Wan Guchan.</p>

<h3>Li Qinian - Waiting for a Ship to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Li Qinian has sent a letter to Shanghai, stating that he is waiting for a ship to come north in Hong Kong and plans to leave Hong Kong within a week. However, it is currently more difficult to book cabin seats, so it is unpredictable whether he can depart as scheduled. As for which ship he will take, the Hong Kong authorities do not allow prior announcements, so it is also impossible to know. Li Qinian has asked the Yi Hua authorities to rent a small Western-style building for him to stay in, as he is said to be unaccustomed to hotel life. In short, Li Qinian's every move and every word will surely refresh our minds and eyes and is most favored by the press in Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Unprecedented Grand Event. The Shaoxing County Relief Donation Committee Sponsors. Grand Performance of Eight Women's Yue Opera Troupes</h3>
<p>— Jian Ming</p>
<p>Held at the Carlton Theater on August 1st</p>
<p>The Shaoxing Seven County Fellow Association, sponsored by the Shaoxing County Relief Donation Committee, has been intensifying its work in various groups since its establishment. The fourth joint meeting of the committee members was held the night before last, and Huang Yuzhai, the director of the general affairs group of the association, hosted a banquet to entertain the gentlemen present. It was resolved that the entertainment assembly in charge of the entertainment group would be advanced and the date would be determined. The famous Shanghai amateur performers and actors’ broadcasting concert will be held continuously on the 22nd and 23rd. The grand performance of eight women's Yue opera troupes is scheduled for August 1st and 2nd for a total of two days. The venue has been provisionally set at the Carlton Theater. Whether famous actors or famous amateurs, they are all eager to help the public and care about their compatriots. Once contacted, they all readily agreed, and their enthusiasm is admirable.</p>
<p>Grand Performance of Eight Women's Yue Opera Troupes</p>
<p>Since women's Yue opera became popular due to Yao Shuijuan, Tu Xinghua, and others, theater owners have all shifted their attention and have successively changed to performing women's Yue opera to suit the needs of the audience. Yue opera has then sprung up and presented an extremely vigorous appearance. However, since women's Yue opera was introduced to Shanghai, there has been no grand performance of a joint performance until now. This time, the famous actors from various theaters are enthusiastic about public welfare and care about their hometowns. They united and held a grand joint performance of eight troupes for the first time. The magnitude of the momentum will surely break the record of joint performances. Last night, Huang Yuzhai, Wei Jinsan, the director of the Yue opera group, and Pei Zhenyong hosted a banquet at the Huizhong Union Club, inviting prominent figures from Shaoxing County and the backstage managers of the eight major Yue opera troupes. In addition to discussing various important matters, the programs for the day and night performances on August 1st and 2nd were decided by drawing lots to arrange Groups A and B in advance. Looking at the main characters arranged, they are all rare talents in the women's Yue opera world. And the excellent plays performed on both days and nights are successful masterpieces of the famous actors. The programs arranged for the two days and nights are recorded here to share with friends who love women's Yue opera. I sincerely hope that the seven county fellows will not miss this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.</p>
