<p>社評</p>
<h3>英美人心目中的國際</h3>
<p>我們不覺得英國衰老，尤自西綫戰事結束後，愈覺得其精神旺健，力量瀰漫：大如決定單獨繼續作戰，小如決定儘速撤退香港婦孺，劍及履及，不屈不撓，具見其强毅。但是這些表現，不是他祇受了直接的目前的實利的刺激，纔如此吧？若從某角度，觀察某幾點，似乎英國人有些意念，暴露了衰老傾向；至少，有關國際動靜的，英國人所判斷與企求，由其傳統的成功而流於機械　方式。我們不該說：史丹林，希特勒，墨索里尼這幾位何以不遵循成軌？可不能不說：傳受衣缽，保守正統的張伯倫浸淫於英國傳統的方式，母乃不合時宜？不僅是張伯倫。前天倫敦每日電聞報紐約電訊有數語：「雖蘇日兩國在遠東之勢不兩立，民治國或能暫獲其利，惟就根本言，包括其他獨裁國家在內之亡命强國，終將沆瀣一氣；」這不是紐約消息，是十足的英人意念。又如同日倫敦泰晤士報紐約電訊有數語「如果蘇德果引起衝突，則日本將迅速趨向軸心國方面，而謀奪取或封鎖蘇聯通太平洋的海參崴；如蘇德依然合作，則東京勢將惶恐，而圖改善其對英美的關係」；這也決不是紐約方面的情報，却是道地的傳統的英人意念。意念不大能夠以客觀的理智的爲其基礎，而往往是主觀判斷與企求的綜結。英國人如此意念，即如此判斷與企求，吾們不能不覺得這是英國傳統的機械方式。他在他的外交史裏屢屢功德圓滿的方式，機械的判斷之於現在，機械的企求之於現在。可是他錯了吧！</p>
<p>蘇日兩國在遠東勢不兩立，自是公開現象，往年日本在强佔中國東三省之後，其朝野運籌者，究竟先打了蘇俄再窺中國，還是先取了中國再打蘇俄？可見勢不兩立已久。然則何以猶恐其沆瀣一氣？德義是同盟國，茲方駢肩作戰，其間有何矛盾，茲姑不加推論。至於蘇聯與德義，在德義對英作戰期間，蘇聯固不會幫英國而致德義於死命，德義尤不會强化對蘇磨擦；然雙方交歡，實有其必然的限度，德義在歐洲愈佔優勢，則蘇聯與德義必愈相戒備。然則何以亦恐其沆瀣一氣？至於日本在蘇聯與德義之間，既因中日久戰而日本喪其參抓軸心的力量，又因歐戰期間蘇德決不反目而日本喪其從中操縱的機會；不但日本對蘇德兩失其歡，抑且蘇德對日本俱有所僧。然則何以謂此四國終將沆瀣一氣？竊以爲美國所欲同情贊助英國者，有其種種因緣，却非因如英國傳統的外交意念所謂某某某焉，將抗瀣一氣。即使「蘇德引起衝突」，日本非但決不將殘餘力量向海參崴移動，而從事所謂奪取或封鎖，必且將蘇日交界處所的殘餘力量，向中國移動。即使「東京因德蘇依然合作而惶恐」，爰「圖改善其對英美關係」，此在英國對德作戰時期，誠有裨於英國，然英國亦已打算乎？英國今日而欲取得日本善意，已準備對日本付出何種代價？事實是否容許？總之，英國外交的時代已經過去，傳統的外交意念已落空，以在遠東而論，若使不想拋棄，惟有決心自衛。關於國際動靜的，美國人比英國人看得眞切，拿得堅定；如紐約郵報是美國政府黨的代表報，昨日評論謂：「不但各民主國，即德義與蘇聯，亦必反對日本企圖控制整個遠東的任何嘗試，日本即或稍有進展，而一到歐戰終了時，無論何方獲勝，日本仍非屈膝不可」。我們完全同意於這結論，且以爲可供英國人借鑑！</p>
<h3>史汀生諾克斯陳述　美國遠東政策途徑　如實施中立將引起可恥後果　美因戰略關係與英獲得諒解</h3>
<p>華盛頓　此間人士相信、東京報紙所傳英美海軍合作、實因日方對美國艦隊之將來行動感覺惶慮所致、此間官塲唯一可能的反響、爲報載不確、惟此語徒令人對美國關於遠東問題之地位、發生不正確印象耳、實則國務院並未改變其反對日方希圖在遠東樹立新秩序之政策、就大西洋或太平洋海軍戰略而言、美國所必須考量者、一方爲日本艦隊可能的敵對行動、一方爲英國艦隊所得之友好、而據此以調整其計畫、其結果幾無異於英、美獲得非正式諒解、（四日路透電）</p>
<p>入閣問題　將付表決</p>
<p>華盛頓　自參委會通過史汀生上校及諾克斯上校、爲陸軍部長及海軍部長之委任後、參議院已於昨晚準備將該二氏加入羅斯福總統新混合內閣」之舉、付之表決、衆信參議院之最後決定、將延至下星期杪、因該院現正有無數重要預算案亟待表決也、參院海委會、昨以九對五之票數通過請參院證實諾克斯上校之委任、至於史汀生上校之委任、則已於星期二在陸姿會以十四票對三票予以通過、衆料一般參議員相信該二新閣員將採取援助英國之危機政策者、將在參院對該二上校作最後之反對、惟國會人士相信、無論如何、該二氏之委任將終被通過也、海委會通過諾氏之委任後、該委會主席華爾許發表談話、贊許芝加哥之報紙發行人（按卽諾氏）、謂其有「直前之毅力及對現時局勢有深切之認識」、華氏宣稱、「本委員會認爲、諾克斯上校具有直前之毅力及對現時局勢之深切認識、必能加速吾國海軍建設之速率、在所接得彼之委任消息時本委員會以爲、諾克斯上校係一主張干涉黨員、故委員會有反對諾氏之傾向、當聽取意見之後、委員會始知諾克斯上校雖在意見上絕對同情協約國、惟渠同時亦宣稱不主張直接加入歐戰、渠主張人民可就道德上及經濟上援助協約國、但反對該種經濟援助由政府執行之、渠聲明反對政府予他國以任何足以牽引美國進入戰爭或危害美國國防之援助、此已　在委員會當衆表明彼之主　　塲矣、」當日在委會公開　　時、有人詢問諾氏對於本國中立法案之意見、諾氏答稱、渠對中立法案之施行予中國及日本至爲「忿怒」、因此案若實行於中日戰爭上、將在遠東問題上有一可恥之後果也、孤立派共和黨參議員强生氏再三聲言、此中立法並未在遠東實施、因羅斯福總統不承認該境之戰爭狀態、因而拒絕正式發出通吿、諾氏答稱、渠反對整個中立法案、並主張應回到國際公法、但同時渠承認在現時局中、國際公法已嫌「脆弱」云、（四日合衆社電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　羅總統新任命之海軍部長諾克斯上校、陸軍部長史汀生上校、昨已分別於參院之海軍及陸軍委員會中、各敷陳其意見、力言美國此後之新前綫在大西洋、並明白指陳美國新遠東政策所循之途徑、諾氏之意見、爲參院所最注意者、卽表明渠不相信美國能有效阻止日本佔領荷屬東印度、負責之海軍界人士以爲、諾氏此種觀念、更就越南及菲律演而論、亦何獨不然、海軍人士以爲、諾克斯之言論、足以打破以前海軍當局所謂、將美國海軍行動擴展至亞洲東南、而以英屬新加坡爲根據地、卽可擊敗日本之說、蓋歐戰之發展、已使大西洋之防務成爲重要、以是美國於遠東方面之措置、不得不非常審愼、諾克斯與史汀生兩氏、雖均爲主張堅强遠東政策者、而此時兩氏則均以爲、按諸目前世界情勢、美國遠東政策之實施、應特別審愼、職是之故、關於日前日外相野村擬將訪問菲律濱之事、美國官方雖甚為不滿、然態度非常謹愼、而不發表任何評論、（四日合衆社電）</p>
<p>英德義蘇　反對獨霸</p>
<p>紐約　紐約「郵報」昨日論日本最近發表之「束亞門羅主義、」稱之爲「輕快之歌劇、」並促美國政府禁運廢鐵至日、謂可使「吾人不至賡續爲日人製造軍用品」云、該報指出日本之宜佈「門羅主義」與實行該主義係截然兩事、該報並稱、不僅各民主國家反對日人獨覇遠東、卽德義蘇、亦何獨不然、日人暫時或可在遠東有所進展、但時日將至、無論歐戰最後勝利屬於何方、日本終將讓步也、同時、紐　導報」指明、美國需要英荷　遠東出產之錫與橡皮、該報　、此爲美國關注日本現時在遠東各種活動之直接原因、該報並稱、日本現時之行動係致逼使美國「綏靖」日本、一如以前羅馬、柏林軸心在歐所爲云、（四日合衆電）</p>
<p>東京　此間權威方面頃稱、日本軍部刻正計劃要求政府、採取堅强之外交政策、而以德國現時在歐之行動爲原則、日陸相畑俊六、昨曾與有田外相討論實施日外相「東亞門羅主義」之手段、畑俊六並以陸軍當局之見解示諸有田、畑俊六於與有田商談後、隨卽在陸軍省召集各高級軍官、報告與外相談話之結果、（四日合衆社電）</p>
<p>東京　日海軍發言人頃稱、美參院海軍委員會主席華爾許最近談話所稱、現時若無英·法合作、美國海軍恐難擊敗日本一語、日本對此、並不感覺欣慰、（一）美國參議員之個人談話、於日本對美國海軍建造程序及其遠東政策之嚴重關懷毫無影響、須知日本只着重具體之事實及行動而不注意空言、有詢以所謂「具體行動」係何所指、該發言人遂歷舉種種美國之行動、如援助重慶政府、日本給東中日戰爭施行「不正當的干涉」、及對日本採用種種經濟壓力等、關於美國新近被任爲海長之諾克斯、在美參院海委會之演說、該發言人之評論謂、美對遠東圖施「不正當的干涉」確爲不智、緣諾克斯當時曾有法國敗後、美若干涉遠東實爲不智一語、論及華爾許所稱、美國艦隊不欲與日本交綏一節、該發言人加以補充之語句云、「日本亦不欲與美國交戰、且無激怒美國艦隊之意、因日本海軍之政策、係以「不侵略」及「不威脅」爲原則者、該發言人又稱、關於越南情勢、雖法國當局已同意切斷重慶軍火之運輸、而欲予以評論尙屬太早、該發言人又稱、渠對前星期、日外務省與陸軍省、爲過早宣布日本「東亞門羅主義」政策、而發生之事件、不能予以評論、緣日外相有田於數日前曾將此項政策、向報界宣布、（四日合衆社電）</p>

<p>（一）切斷瑞典之鐵鑛沙供給、或破壞其鐵沙鑛、</p>
<p>（二）破壞羅馬尼亞及蘇聯巴頓巴柯地方之煤油井、</p>
<p>（三）拉攏斯干第那維亞各國對德作戰、如此協約國可多得兵力上師、</p>
<p>（四）敦勸羅馬尼亞·土耳其·希臘·南斯拉夫四國對德宣戰、若四國間同意則可對德動員約一百師、</p>

<p>其第二件秘密檔案係甘茂林將軍作於一九四〇年三月十日之備忘錄、透露英法兩國擬在斯干第那維亞及巴爾幹設置新戰綫之秘密、略謂、「自一九四〇年一月十六日之後、法國軍事最高當局已擬就武裝干涉芬蘭之整個計劃、協約國分遣隊商定先在貝特薩摩登陸、同時協約國軍隊佔領挪威西海岸之海港及飛機港、作為一種預防措施、其後倘事屬可能、軍事行動可擴大至瑞典、對德鐵鑛沙供給極關重要之茄利伐勒之鐵沙田、應卽加以佔領、同時須在那維克魯利亞之間成立新交通綫、當與英國最高軍事當局作半官討論之時、英方亦具此同見、其後一月三十一日與二月一日之英法軍事會談、英方將直接援助芬蘭問題、置於第二步、表示對瑞典北部鐵鑛沙田應先有所行動、英法最高軍事會議亦多數擁護此項意見、於是開始遠徴斯干第那維亞之準備、英法聯軍部卽準備於三月一日出發、至言巴爾幹、倘巴爾幹能發動戰事、則在經濟上能增加對德國之壓迫、但就軍事觀點而言、巴爾幹之行動較斯干第那維亞當能於法國更多之利益、但此項問題尚須視義大利之態度而定、果爾則戰事範圍當難免趨於擴大、南斯拉夫·羅馬尼亞·希臘·土耳其·當能動員一百師、補充協約國之實力、反之、斯干第那維亞方面、瑞典與挪威僅能動員十師而已、但斯干第那維亞方面能展開戰爭、對英法亦屬有利、對斯干第那維亞之計劃、吾人應以全力救濟芬蘭、最低限度亦必控制瑞典之鐵鑛沙田及挪威海港、但就戰略而論、巴爾幹與高加索則更為重要而有利、能切斷德國之煤油供給、但巴爾幹之鎖鑰尚在義大利手中、甘茂林簽字、」</p>
<p>其第三件秘密檔案為甘茂林將軍於一九四〇年三月十二日致魏剛將軍電文、略謂、「余以為近東中部之戰事應由英軍負責、高加索方面之軍事應由土耳其軍隊負責、該總司令可與土耳其參謀總長卻堯瑪克將軍討論該項問題、至高加索方面之戰略、其摘要當交專差送來、」</p>

<p>其第五件秘密檔案、為甘茂林將軍向總司令提出之最後建議、主張強迫德國放棄其「現行觀望態度、加以封鎖中立國、違者予以「報復」手段、倘挪威與瑞典違犯封鎖、接濟德國、則將切斷其國外貿易之路綫、同時更主張切斷蘇聯以煤油運往德國、但此引起對蘇作戰之問題、並以覺取土耳其之合作為對策、果爾則轟炸巴頓巴柯油田、可完全斷絕德國之燃料供給、同時希望在土耳其獲得空軍根據地、為協助實現該項計劃起見、海軍應封鎖黑海之交通、同時為妨礙德國之內河航運起見、應由飛機在各河投擲炸彈、蘇芬停戰雖使人失望但吾人所定之一九四〇年之重要目標仍不變、吾人應拉攏各中立國、在此時機、吾人應同時致力於軍事與外交活動、甘茂林簽字、」（四日海通電）</p>

<h3>金融　利空傳說充溢市塲　黃金竟成一面倒</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市況遽告猛落、達二百餘元、絲傳香港金價跌進五千元關內、又因港島黃金運輸受阻、致本埠購後準備後運往者、被迫而吐、並聞天津運到黃金一千兩、在市脫售、致塲內賣出壓力加重、而一般執貨者、見勢不佳、決心出籠者頗夥、晨開尚穩為五千三百元、嗣曾升起三十元、乃錢兌業吸進若干、但不久卽釀成盛大賣風、銀號幫金號大批出籠、證券幫銀樓業亦有塞出、雖某錢兌業仍有收購、無如眾寡懸殊、愈做愈小、最抵撳達五千零五十元、大有慘入五千元大關之勢、幸午收告定、五千零八十元收盤、後市初開人心仍疲、為五千零九十五元、未幾降十餘元、惟金號證券幫買意頓萌、相與扒入、價遂提高至五千一百八十元、奈當日吸進之錢兌業多頭乘機了結、故晚盤僅五千一百三十元、較上日降二百十五元、全天交易約四千兩、銀樓飾金掛小二十元、海關金等仍平、</p>
<p>烚赤近五千元關</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）初以人心疲弱、開市卽撳四十五元、銀號出錢兌業十兩、為五千三百元、嗣賴某錢兌業及某證券幫扒進、曾見回升三十元、銀號出錢兌業共三十兩、為五千三百三十元、旋外匯報鬆、零一證券幫與某銀號爭先拋塞、又降落七十元、錢兌業出銀號等共數十兩、均為五千二百六十元、此後賣風稍息、錢兌業稍有購入、重又回升三十元、金號互做三十兩、為五千二百九十元、顧以外匯鬆勢加厲、且加斯時種種利空消息、盛傳於市、致重引起賣風、某證券幫與銀號等競向傾吐、而金號亦跟之拋空、雖一般買戶見賤、絡續收撈、奈頭寸極感充斥、不久竟慘跌二百四十元、金號出銀號十兩為五千零五十元、午刻銀號錢兌業吃胃轉旺、　告向漲、證券幫出金號二十兩、為五千零八十元作午　　、午後聞時景況仍劣、銀號出　錢十兩、為五千零九十五元、嗣因散戶　賣、又跌十五元、銀號對做十兩、為五千零八十元、旋某金號忽來拖入、且不久匯市亦報極軟、同時證券幫風景跟買、遂回漲一百元、金號出同業等數十兩、升為五千一百八十元、晚收前終因外匯仍鬆、高價難以站住、銀號出金號二十兩、復退為五千一百三十元作晚收價、結果比上日軋跌二百十五元、收後塲外尤疲、最後五千一百十五元有人肯賣、但未做開、全天二百八十元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤亦較高十數元、收進減低三十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十餘元、均鮮做開、</p>
<p>首飾金連小三檔</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、初時大同行仍懸五百五十元、迨十時掛小十元、十一點又低十元、午刻再抵十元、下午二時始回大十元、結果比上日較覙二十元、計大同行改懸五百三十元、新同行與上價相同、收進減低三十元光景、</p>
<p>貼現做四十五元　拆息亦低</p>
<p>昨日匯劃票據貼現率、傾跌益銳、每千元，貼進竟做小至四十五元、貼出亦僅五十元、下午未見變動、比上日再跌十元、錢業公會拆息再掛小一分、計二角一分、聞有低至二角關內可能云、</p>
<h3>外匯轉賣愈殷切</h3>
<p>外匯昨日市況、匯豐掛牌、悉無上落、英美匯暗市、依然賣過於買、潛勢處鬆、乃中美新借款談判成立傳說益盛、且歐洲和平空氣復濃、並聞香港金價、有跌進五千元關內之說、又香港黃金進口受阻、更傳烚赤暗盤狂落、匯市亦受影響、晨開最長美匯達六元二八一二五、下午華商獲利補進、一度稍回、不久賣勢復萌、故復硬至以最鬆價收盤、先令三辦士九三七五、美金六元二八一二五、英長〇六二五、美長一五六二五、全日交易極旺、昨為美國獨立紀念日、今日美國匯兌等無電、</p>
<p>港方初吸美金</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條、近跌〇六二五、遠期則平、美銀價不動、倫敦生金呆定、匯兌英對美滬等仍平、對法無電、美對英大二分、對滬升一角、對法無市、中央掛牌如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金三辦士八七五、美匯六元一二五、較之前收、英美兩匯均平、同時期貨開出亦無榮辱、開後英行俱懷賣意、雖港電及某戶吸進美金約十萬元、但頭寸頗感充裕、市面帶硬、匯豐掛牌揭曉不動、白銀平衡稅揭曉、減低百分之〇·二五、時港電進英行有利麥加利曁美行等七月份美匯六元一五六二五與一二五、嗣某投機家曾來扒現美匯計入美行價為六元一八七五、但不久華行狂塞、潛勢步步趨鬆、計華銀行吐予外行如匯豐麥加利等等七月份美匯由六元一八七五、做達二五、迨至收盤、價愈見長先令、三辦士九三七五、美匯為六元二八一二五、七月份英金三辦士九〇六二五、美匯六元二五、較之晨開、現貨英硬〇六二五、美鬆一五六二五、期貨亦長、</p>
<p>華商獲利補進</p>
<p>午後初開、華商投機家獲利補進、曾扒入七月份美匯六元二五、以至二一八七五、市象微形軟化、後則回吐與外行有利及華行浙江同月美匯六元二五、及六元二八一二五、故晚收價與午收完全相同、英金三辦士九三七五、美匯六元二八一二五、七月份英金三辦士九〇六二五、美匯六元二五、比上日收盤、現貨英長〇六二五、美硬一五六二五、七月份英鬆〇六二五、美硬一八七五、</p>
<p>香港英緊美鬆</p>

<h3>美金票　跌破十六元關</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市況、英美金鎊隨烚赤一致暴落五元、英美金票以黑市外匯頻鬆、各方供給頗暢、前者下跌五角、後者竟又跌進十六元關、香港票隨港滬匯兌下跌五分、坎拿大票及匪列濱票均不乏供給、市價一致下疲、日金票供給激減、市價漸轉定勢、晚市為一元一角三分半、朝鮮票供求均勻、晚市仍為九角七分、</p>
<h3>雜糧　日商收買蠶豆</h3>
<p>邇來蠶豆市面、一因此種粗糧在此米價昂貴聲中、鄉人有貯藏之意、故來源不暢、二為販運客商雖乏船位搬運、但日商依然蒞市搜辦、裝運華南華北、致在此到存兩稀之情形下、其價冉冉上升、昨市本街興化等採去嘉定白皮蠶豆六百餘包、價為二十二元五角、蕪湖小粒白皮蠶豆二百包、價為二十元、北港青皮蠶豆二百五十餘包、價為二十三元至二十一元五角云、</p>

<p>證券暗盤、昨日趨勢驟變、市價一律挺進、甲種逼近六十二元、乙種又穿出兩元至二元半、卽向處冷淡之丁種、亦已穿出九元、市況堪稱良好、初因德英有和平之傳聞、或將連帶及於中日之糾紛得一解決、午後更傳向美借款有成立希望、人心轉堅、更以金子狂跌、反映印象甚好、一時空頭紛紛抵補、市況自始至終逐步上騰、惟買賣各戶中大戶仍未見踴躍、午前交易不多、聯和稍有買進、順泰賣出、午後需要驟殷、聯和繼續買進、順亨公茂大豐胡鶴記·及零星散戶紛紛抵補、或有做多、久豐轉賣、久康賣出較多、聯益協大益昌均有出脫、但各價仍拾級而上、惟希消息得以證實、否則仍不易立定也、漲跌結果、一律上漲四角至六角不等、成交約共九十餘萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>

<h3>糧食　米價一跌卽漲</h3>
<p>昨日上午米市、初開賣買雙方因承上日之餘勢、不獨買方買氣衰頺賣方亦恐復起直瀉、頗有求脫、蓋以洋米前後所到達六七萬包之多、所定暹米二三十萬包亦可在旬內抵埠、人心頓軟、賣氣突旺、價乃立瀉一元至一元半近二元不一、做開小絞祗六十一元、東京　尖其較次者已退進六十元大關、僅五十九元半、五十九元不一、但以小紋大戶不再售出、浮貨亦枯、內地幫及鄉荘戶乘廉採辦中下段小價之貨、拉連不絕、市色乃見活絡、小價貨首先回昂、再度穿出六十元大關、繼之本街店胃亦加入暢辦、迄收市悉恢復原盤、與前市相仿、若一號陳西貢仍為六十五元半、二號六十三元半、一號暹羅六十五元、安南新粳六十五元二角、小紋六十二元七角、六十二元半、然全市上落、亦有二元之巨、全市開現六千餘包、期貨二百噸、</p>
<p>糯米市續在堅緊中、蓋其原因、據業中人言、乃以內地存底將罄、來源不繼、而滬棧所積亦薄、同時去路方面因糯價較他貨甚廉、殊受平民歡迎、不獨店鋪門市旣旺、而飯担尤為着重、物希為貴、售價繼漲元半左右、計開金溧白元六十五元、常丹白六十三四元、江北元乏貨無市、</p>
<p>厚薄粳等國米續到千餘包、傳聞塲外暗盤、一則因早市洋米暴跌、人心亦虛、並謀甩脫、二則售價高貴、作客棘手、致交易寥寥、開價續貶元砠、常幫特清粳七十三元半、七十三元、蘇崑常州粳七十一二元、次至宿貨六十九元、青泗特薄七十三元、大市七十二元至七十元、南港早稻六十九元云云、</p>
<h3>內地粉充斥市塲　小麥來源將通</h3>
<p>麵粉　昨市續告堅站、二號粉廠盤仍開十五元二角、祗限供給本街實銷、客幫與囤戶悉加限制、造成內地雜牌之傾銷、如雙獅·金山·強生·鳳凰牌等、充斥於市、昨市綠鳳凰及雙獅現貨、悉售十六元、聞期貨亦有拋出、七八月份鳳凰粉十六元四角、又金山強生粉十六元一角、價比高峯時已低二三角、至華廠方面批出者、約計一萬餘包而已、</p>
<p>小麥　昨新麥來源、逐有零星抵埠、而正式市面、迄難開展、大部份均為日前拋貨交解、聞日廠方面、收進約有近萬包、價為廿五元至二十四元五六角、華廠遇有少數點綴、終無大額可收、聞搬運許可證接洽、已有相當眉目、恐不久麥市卽可湧旺云、</p>
<h3>紗花　七月份期紗　傳已做開　取銷證金改繳差金</h3>
<p>紗市平靜、大勢狀況在盤旋中、同時實際交易、粗紗香港雲南兩幫、採辦尚稱不弱、所以人心較為安定、據市塲言、七月份期貨稍有成交、價為九百十元至八百九十五元、雙方都不收證金、市價變動相差一百元、繳給差金百元、此種做法、等於變相的交易所、就此而論、市面無大升降、當然不生問題、如果成效籌碼一增、起伏隨之浩大、前途糾紛、更難解決矣、</p>
<p>現紗晨開因各方材料及環境仍屬不利於多方、二十支雙馬價為八百九十元、跌至八十元、旋聞廣幫需要尚維持、人氣重振、又復漲至八百九十七元、詎料外匯鬆懈、及黃金下挫、枱面轉趨軟化、又見回落、收盤價為八百八十七元、查半日間成交統計一千八百九十九包、行情二十支雙馬價予上日無甚軒輊、今日有紗三十五件運廈門、三十件運香港、九十五件運煙臺、茲將各幫口買去之額量、分列如左、</p>
<p>同行一、二〇〇　香港三二五</p>
<p>內地四　寗波二〇〇</p>
<p>雲南一七〇　統計一、八九九</p>
<h3>同行觀望　棉市沉寂</h3>
<p>現棉交易依然沉悶如常、廠方需要寥若晨星、同行中亦觀望不前、惟日廠方面稍有採辦、然銀款須遲一二個月付給、美種彭家浦價為二百零二元、日廠進二百件、二個月交款云、</p>
<p>外棉市價、紐約棉市晨初頗形堅定、因棉區報告氣候不佳之消息、後因紐奧倫斯及利物浦幫之購買、結果收盤價格、較之上日漲七至十六磅音、印度昨日無行市、然預測漲一羅比半、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、殊為靜寂、各方俱因局勢情形之複雜、暫抱觀望態度、各同業則以印棉運輸困難、故心意頗為堅定也、</p>
<h3>疋頭　棉布頹勢難挽</h3>
<p>國布　昨市浙東各幫辦突旺、染坯布需要稍增、祗以市上存底豐厚、難挽頹勢、白貨細布·細斜·粗布·每疋續跌二角半之譜、漂染布跌五角左右、浙路溫甬臺幫辦粗布·細布·斜紋·色布·印花布·五百餘件、聞因原由粵滇入口各貨大部份已改由浙東口岸輸入之故、本街染廠辦下檔斜紋一百餘件、批發號辦粗布漂染布一百數十件、閩幫辦線叫嗶嘰八角二分半、客銷仍清閒、惟本街交易稍形熱鬧、同業賣戶轉缺、至午收盤微見升騰、龍頭售開二十八元四角、嗶嘰八角三分半、</p>
<h3>南北貨　橘餅升三元</h3>
<p>新到廈橘餅二十件、昨已開出、比前盤漲起三元、行盤因亦喊高、後到尚防再緊、</p>
<h3>絲茶　輸出華茶限制產量</h3>
<p>自歐戰發生以來、華茶對外貿易、已受重大打擊、近更因義國參戰、地中海航行中斷、致去路停滯、華當局為適應環境、調整供求起見、業經貿易委員會在渝召集會議、對於外銷紅綠茶實行限制產量、依照各省向來產茶比例、較上年度減少百分之二十、據一般估計稱、本年皖贛區域、限量三十四萬箱、浙閩二十八萬箱、兩湖十八萬箱、預料本年輸出華茶、右央統制之下、總額尚有八十萬箱云、今日有茶葉二百零五件運廈門</p>
<h3>藥材　金銀花交易零星　低至一百七十五元</h3>
<p>金銀花自入夏以來、新貨盛出、及時而銷、市情頗形活潑、查前市最高達二百二十元、旋低至二百元、迄於目前各客幫受胃漸足、去化因之疲滯、且存積尚裕、交易僅有零星、如新貨上荘售一百八十元至一百七十五元、存貨乏人問津、</p>
<h3>油市　生油互有來往</h3>
<p>昨日天津運來生油三千五百聽、又一百件、今日出口、又有生油九百九十四聽、運往香港、又一百四十五聽、運往廈門、</p>
<h3>五金　會司鐵平穩</h3>
<p>會司鐵交易因南洋幫之銷路閉塞後、兼之華北路如津煙青等幫客商進胃亦呆、故市角頗形蕭條、人心亦甚萎靡、雖本街方面如玩具·印鐵·製罐·香煙·餅乾等廠時見搜羅、但成交究屬有限、行情因成本高昂與到貨稀少、依然堅硬、老鋼廠二百元、新鋼廠一百八十元左右、</p>

<h3>夫婦知識　恩愛夫妻的衛生要訣</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士姚崇培　性病專科醫師詹念曾合著</p>
<p>（診所）　北京四川路口中國信託公司二樓</p>
<p>（時間）　上午十時至下午六時　星期日休息</p>
<p>夫妻固當恩愛，但在恩愛中每忽略了衛生</p>
<p>如發現性能衰弱有妨愛情，速求特效療法</p>
<p>在戀愛塲中，一個男子追求一個少女，辛辛苦苦的千方百計由不相識而相識，由相識而友誼，更由友誼再進一步而講愛情，有時真為對方而神昏顛倒，廢寢忘食，一旦由相互諒解而舉行結婚，這在兩方身心上是多麼抱着熱騰騰的渴望，所以於婚禮之後，賓客散了，他們是沒有不完成其『錦賬無風銀鈎動，嬌吁喘喘夢魂香，』這一幕喜劇的。這幕喜劇是創造他們共有的新世界之開始，所以很有許多男子，自甜蜜的婚後，一帆風順，數十年猶如一日，待到兒女成行，個個都伶俐有為，事業成功了，件件都稱心如意，而給親鄰朋友，祝公布多福多壽多男子，這時他恍然了夫婦恩愛如衷同濟的功效，笑逐顏開，內心上有說不出的歡慰！在歷史上郭子儀的做壽和過去馬相伯先生的百齡大慶，想該誰都知道的吧！</p>
<p>可是世間事常多矛盾，恩愛夫妻每多忽略了衛生要訣，致荒淫無度者比比皆是。更有男子因早年自凟縱慾，或染毒傷身，致天賦機能衰弱，則一旦於婚後，每爆發遺精滑精，精力渙散，久婚不育神經衰弱諸症，則雖性有餘而力不足，夫婦間的兩性生活卽無法圓滿，如此，年輕妻子，坐令青春蹉跎，能不怨恨倍加？是以夫婦間卽不免貌合神離，時生勃谿，甚至與人私通私奔竞興仳離之訟者亦時有所聞！至於男子自身亦每因神經的極度衰弱，而有頭脹腦痛，健忘失眠，心神煩亂，不能思索，稍一行動，耳中如鳴珮璜，竟有因此昏蹶不省人事者，此種男子不未老先衰或早年妖殤者能有幾人？其危機為何似！</p>
<p>時在今日，醫藥科學昌明，對於上述各症已有對症特效療法，卽服生殖腺互不製劑。「生殖素」則於一日夜間卽能生精補賢，健腦活血，滋養神經，使病勢減輕，若繼續服用，必可於短期內將上述各症完全治愈，並可使身體益增健康收返老還童之效。惟有遺精者，須兼服「希米脫氏固精片」以固精關，制止遺洩，則收效更為神速，但患者如在本埠能親來電療，注射，手術及其他之對症療法，更可保證治愈。</p>
<h3>健美　乳峯是女性幸福的泉源</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士姚崇培</p>
<p>無論在某種塲合，健美女郎總是佔着便宜。因為男子對於健美女郎總是愛慕的，社會對於健美女郎總是尊重的。然則女郎如何能增進健美？在醫學上言：這惟有使卵巢機能健全的一個秘訣。因為女性的卵巢機能健全，關於女性身體上的特徵卽有良好的發育，最顯著的就是乳部呈堅實而有彈性的峯狀聳起，雖然穿了衣服，也能在衣服裏露出來，雙峯並峙，中間幽深，這是多麼引人心醉！同時臀部亦必相當發達，加這活潑的柳腰，就形成女性最神秘的全部曲線美。此種女郎因體態的發達，新陳代謝作用亦必旺盛，在皮膚，肌肉，血液以及內分泌中產生着多量的新生細胞，因此皮膚自然變白嫩而滋潤，肌肉呈豐腴而飽滿狀態，血液充盈而鮮紅，血色由滋潤的皮膚裏透露出來，而部卽呈蘋果似的美麗。所以此種女郎係完全天然的健美，可無待脂粉他人已莫能及。不特在處女時代，猶桃花迎笑春風，她的快樂與美麗無比，就是為愛人看中了結為夫婦，亦必夫婦間愛情彌篤，貴子早生，組織甜蜜的家庭，此時不特是一個光榮的主婦，也是一個幸福的母親。可是這種女性世間究竟不多，其原因卽為大多數的婦女，患有月經不調，白帶，不感等症，卵巢機能受其摧殘呈衰弱狀態，新陳代謝作用亦因以減退，是以卽乳癟顏衰成醜陋女子，不能生育，無做母親的資格，她命運的悲慘是可想而知的。唯一補救辦法，卽服卵巢製劑女用「生殖素」，以培補卵巢，滋養神經如能繼續服用，必可於短期內將上述疾病完全治愈，更可使乳峯聳起增進健美。</p>
<h3>遺精會招致甚麼惡果？</h3>
<p>— 性病專科醫師詹念曾</p>
<p>大家都知道青年人的遺精症，對於身體是很有害的。但究竟會招致些什麼病！恐怕就是醫生也難知道其詳，因為人的身體是有機體，疾病的千變萬化是很難預測的。好比遺精，一般人說起來是一種病症，其實病症的本身並不是遺精，遺精乃是病象，我們研究何以而有遺精，大都因為自凟，荒淫，過勞……等原因將神經弄得衰弱了，在司性器官的一部份因為失卻了效用或呈過敏的反應，那就不能適當地控制着精關的作用，所以就有遺精的現象，如果遺精過頻，神經必益加衰弱，新陳代謝作用亦必減退，各部老細胞的死亡過多，新細胞的產生缺乏，是以面黃肌瘦，腦力衰弱，失眠健忘，耳鳴眼花，頭腦脹痛等狀態，這是腦神經極度衰弱的症象；腰　背痛，筋骨酸軟，肢體疲憊等狀態，這是脊髓神經極度衰弱的症象；至於滑精漏精，早洩陽萎，精力渙散等狀態，這是性神經極度衰弱的症象，此外因為發育機能的受阻，常致身材低矮，局部短小如指，精蟲的產生稀少，或竟至全無，遂致久婚不育，這均為遺精失治的青年，所難免的病症。至於貧血，癆瘵，早衰，折壽等雖與遺精有甚大的關係，但其合併病症。也不一而足關於遺精的特效療法，此時只有服「希米脫氏固精片」為最好，因此藥於服後即能鞏固精關，鎮靜神經，可得安眠，減少夢幻，遺精自可根除。如因遺精已引起上述症象者，須兼服生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」，以培補精血，腦賢及神經，若繼續服用，必可於短期內將上述各症完全治愈，并可助長發育機能，旺盛新陳代謝作用，可收延年益壽返老還童之效。</p>
<h3>鐵一般的事實</h3>
<p>— 性病專科醫師詹念曾錄</p>
<p>（一）遺精滑精可致青年的死命</p>
<p>秦志廉君，年二十歲，杭州人，父業地產商，家中頗富有，現在本埠某中學高中部三年級肄業，因天資聰穎，品學均優，惟聰明人每被聰明誤，因秦君情竇早開，不免與女同學談情說愛，情書往返，習以為常，奈因戀愛心切，情不自禁，曾犯自凟惡癖，雖屢戒屢犯，未能決絕，致精關鬆弛，繼起遺精症，初為每月二三次，繼漸增至五六次，初則因夢而遺，繼則無夢亦遺，於是感覺精神倦怠，腦衰健忘，失眠心悸等症象叢生，稍一勞動，更有腰酸背痛，肢體憊困等現象，昔日各科成績列入甲等者，今則每不及格，大有退學留級的危險！春假中稍受感冒，竟臥床不起多日，病中憂慮，恐短命而死！故特懇求予以診治（以上患者自訴）秦君於上月初至本診所診治，經診斷後，知確係遺精失治之故，乃即囑其購治遺特效藥「希米脫氏固精片」兩匣，生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」兩打，使之兼服，遺精止後單服「生殖素」同時施以迭門氏電療術，至今月餘，已覺頭腦清明，精神振足，前述症象已完全霍然。</p>
<p>（二）婚後神經衰弱的丈夫苦了妻子</p>
<p>沈克先君，年卅歲，業銀錢界，婚後有賢虧陽痿症象，間有遺精。因之房事不能美滿，或竟完全不能，此不特自己沒趣，也未免太苦了妻子，曾服市上補品補藥，均鮮效果，近身體益感不支故求診治（上自述）經余詳察其病狀後，囑其購「生殖素」三打，「希米脫氏固精片」一匣，并每日用電療注射等醫術，兩月於茲，沈君覺精強力足，症象全愈，夫婦愛情彌深　綣矣。</p>

<h3>赫德大將晤英大使　商遠東局勢對策　英美密切合作制止侵略　美國輿情對華一致關切　美下屆總統競選與遠東之關係</h3>
<p>遠東局勢、邇來因東方侵略國其欲逐逐、企圖乘機攫取港越荷印等地、以致形勢頓趨緊張、據平明社記者昨向某民治國之外交界權威方面探詢得可恃消息、英美對於遠東政策、現經英美兩國當局之迭次會商、意見已趨一致、此次美國亞洲艦隊司令赫德大將、於前晨（四日）乘美艦伊沙佩爾號由靑島來滬、參加昨晨之美國獨立紀念慶祝典禮後、卽於昨日上午十時許、曾與英國駐華大使寇爾爵士、在英大使館官舍會晤商談、其內容雖無從探悉、但衆信英大使與赫德上將、關於遠東目前局勢有所會商、似無可疑、</p>
<p>英美合作各國欣慰</p>
<p>又據某外籍觀察家表示、昨晨、赫德大將與英大使之晤談、實為最近所傳英美兩國在遠東方面切實合作之有力證明、而使中外各國所引為欣慰、蓋遠東侵略者、現正欲有所動作、明為策應德義、實則純圖自利、直接攫取英法荷蘭權益、間接威脅美國、目前之所以遲遲未動者、正為乘機待時而已、因其本身軍力之主體、正為中國抗戰所絆住泥脚、如英美強化遠東政策而一致合作、必可使之有所顧忌、</p>
<p>美下屆總統之政策</p>
<p>密勤氏評論報社論、其主題為美國未來之總統競選與遠東之關係、該文略稱、美國未來之總統、究將屬諸美國有名以來連任三期之羅斯福、抑或屬諸共和黨候選人威爾基、非至十一月全國選舉大會開會後、殊不能預決其鹿死誰手、設或美國人民願見民主黨暫吿退休而由共和黨上台執政、則共和黨領袖鑒于當前歐洲戰禍之嚴重、或將放棄其以前所持之孤立主義政策、而不得不</p>
<p>協助民治國家、一如民主黨所為者、威爾基氏之對外政策、根據其過去之發言、可以槪括言之如下、卽（一）對歐洲主張援助協約國、但不參戰、（二）對遠東採取強硬之政策、但不反對與日本成立諒解、（三）實行多方面之鬥羅主義、（四）最要者為貿易擴張與扶助西半球之</p>
<p>經濟勢力</p>
<p>查美國在日本電力企業之投資、為數在美金三萬五千萬元以上、但此項企業、已由日政府武斷接收而歸入由軍閥支配之政治組織中矣、同時美國在華之投資與利益亦甚夥、其中尤以上海電車公司為最、威爾基向以注意美人之投資與利益見於國人、然則其對於上述之事、將來必有一番謹愼之考慮、殆無疑義、</p>
<p>美國輿情極度激昂</p>
<p>字林西報云、某美僑在美國南部各州遊歷一年後、近返上海、據談稱、美國輿情對於目下橫行於世的各侵略國之行動、頗為震驚、美國南部某小鎭居民接獲德國侵犯荷蘭消息、於一宵間莫不轉而擁護協約國、卽往時對協約國不甚關切者、亦立卽贊成美國給予種種積極援助、以求速戰速決、美國</p>
<p>反對日人之情緒、亦甚激昂、而深切關注於中國傳出之一切消息、邇來各報對面所載歐洲消息擁護、而將中國消息移後、惟「紐約時報」與「芝加哥每日新聞」、對於中國消息仍以特殊地位刋出之、近任陸軍部長之史汀生上校、向甚贊成、</p>
<p>對日禁運</p>
<p>美國各級人士與黨派受其影響頗巨、該美僑續稱、渠在美遊歷時、發覺美國人民對於中國人民之現况、甚為關心、而多就此事向港紛紛發問、中國民衆移居西部、美國人民頗受感動、而在美賑濟計劃、素為衆所注意、各方慨助、殊見熱烈云、</p>
<h3>徐家匯天文台　照常進行工作　儀器極為複雜　遷移諸多困難</h3>
<p>徐家滙區法捕房及法防軍撤退後、該區內之徐家滙天文台、因所有氣象時間地震等各部份測候儀器極為複雜、遷移困難、故仍照常進行工作、並按時作氣象及時間報吿、至外傳該台附近仍留駐小隊法兵防守之說、則屬不確、惟該台工作、均在內部、所有職工、亦深居簡出、一切均維持常態、</p>
<h3>昨慶祝美獨立紀念　各界均極振奮　時局嚴重之際舉行盛典　含義重大慶祝情况熱烈</h3>
<p>昨日為美國獨立紀念、天氣明朗、陽光燦然、棲埠美僑所預定之一切祝典、均能如期舉行、其熱烈之情况、非筆墨所能形容、本埠美國機關、均循例休假、惟若干商店、則上午尚行營業、至下午則一致休假、泊於滬濱之美艦、有呂宋號及赫德上將私人游艇意塞倍爾號、昨日為慶祝計、滿掛旌旗、臨風招展、極為美觀、上午八時卅分、在哥倫比亞總會、舉行升旗典禮、由美海軍麥令隊音樂隊奏美國國歌、參加者除麥令隊外、到者約二千人、本埠美官方要員、如赫德大將·蒲屈立克代理總領·海爾密克按察使·美僑協會主席麥克美倫·哥倫比亞總會主席莫克里斯·美國總會主席安徒生·等、均參加盛典、情况頗為莊嚴、下午十二時卅分至二時、美國總會又舉行歡宴、座上來賓、均舉杯為美總統羅斯福氏祝福、下午其他球賽野餐、及晚間之跳舞會、均有一番熱烈之情况、</p>
<p>民主戰綫</p>
<p>按美國宣佈獨立、係一七七六年之事、而於同年七月四日、正式發表民主獨立宣言、値此世界局勢日趨嚴重之際、各界人士、對之均極表感奮、緣其含義、在今日尤足重視也、本埠西文報紙除一致刋載關於本埠美僑慶祝獨立紀念日之狀况外、又復著論評述、英半官報字林西報、更以極重要之地位、特闢一角、刋載關於獨立紀念日之文字、其文首先轉載獨立宣言中一段文字、「吾人深信所有人類均屬平等、而有生命·自由·及追求幸福之權、每一政府、均須按照此三大目標、為人民謀幸福、否則人民卽有權否決之、基於上述原則、另行組設新政府、以保其安全與幸福」、該文復稱、値此緊張之時機中、所有民治主義國家、應立於同一戰綫、以抵抗其同一之敵人、英美在血統及政治上思想上、頗多相似、故美人對英人同情與援助、自將日益增加、英人方面、亦願値此美國獨立紀念日、予人以絕大之鼓舞云、該報社評、亦復以「美獨立紀念日」為題、對美人爭取獨立及自由之精神、予以讚頌、而認為應加效法、</p>
<p>爭取自由</p>
<p>大陸報之社論、以「民主主義之零點」為題、其文略云、「今日為美國慶祝其一六六周獨立紀念日、當民主主義瀕於退化之際、美國慶祝獨立紀念、實具有全世界均應重視之性質、蓋自由人之光明、卽自由平等及幸福之追求、已再度陷於被暴戶所挑戰、而欲加以奴使、時至今日、實可稱為民主主義之零點也、但強有力之民主主義、在一九四〇年之失望時期中、已獲得其更強大之力量、無論如何、個人及國家之自由、唯有抵抗外來之攻擊、始克有救、故為自由而奮鬥、在人類歷史上並非新發現、民主主義本身卽為一戰鬥之哲學、美國獨立紀念日、實足以象徵人類爭取自由之最後勝利、而今日千萬人類、正為眞自由與光明而奮鬥也」云、泰晤士報亦著論評述、最後結束其文云、「吾人應保持此光榮之一日」此外、各西報亦於是日發行特刋、</p>
<h3>英官方定周內發表聲明　為僑民服務而發</h3>
<p>昨日大中社記者由本埠英國官塲方面探悉、關於上星期英大使在無綫電廣播中所稱、本埠英僑從事於積極服務之計劃一節、將於本周內發表正式之聲明、最近英國在華僑民協會、對於本埠入伍作戰之問題、亦曾加以討論、並發通吿與各會員、述如何扶助英國戰時基金之最好辦法、</p>
<h3>郵局大厦前　障碍物已撤除</h3>

<h3>土地局卷宗　今晨竟爾移交　對兪鴻鈞抗議不願表示　越界築路談判傳有發展</h3>
<p>關於土地局卷宗問題、因租界當局之讓步、勢將淪落僞方、工部局此種舉動、無論於法於情、均不能使人無憾之舉、巳引起各方之非議、滬戰時正式將此項卷宗托付保管之舉、實屬違背協定、大礙上海中外業主之利益、但大中社記者昨日特以此事訪問工部局總辦費利溥氏時、則證實「移交」卷宗之事、竟如外間所傳、將於今晨舉行矣、</p>
<p>費利溥氏　答記者問</p>
<p>大中社記者最先叩詢費氏、外間傳稱土地局卷宗三百十二箱、將於今晨「移交」、此事確吾、費氏頷首曰、「然」、記者詢以「移交」手續、是否將由工部局送交日總領三浦、答稱「不詳」、記者謂、然則將由白領館派員來局領取乎、答稱、「大的如是」、記者又叩以日方接得此項卷宗後、是否卽將轉交僞「市府」、費氏答日「是則非本人所知矣」、至是記者以七海市長兪鴻鈞氏之抗議、局方將如何答復、舉以相詢、但費氏不願有所表示、記者轉而叩詢關於穆時英被狙一事、僞「市府」會提抗議於工部局、聞措詞激烈、局方又將何以報之、費氏謂「在考慮中」、</p>
<p>西報所載　一般情勢</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、據本市官方人士之一般意見、工部局經駐滬日總領事三浦而交出華方土地局卷宗之結果、影響此間正常局勢之數項重要問題、刻正迅速近於解決、官方相主要懸案、爲工部局與「市府」間協定之履行、及公共租界警務處管轄蘇州河北區、將在月內解決、</p>
<p>滬西特警</p>
<p>據某方面消息、「巿府」傳筱菴對於滬西越界築路聯合警察隊之成立事、將在數日內送出最後答覆、查公共租界警務處長包文少校、已就新警隊提出最後建議、今信聯合警察隊將早日成立、</p>
<p>稅收問題</p>
<p>同時工部局業已提出其代表之姓名、俾與「市府」嗟商雙方協定中之第二種問題、卽越界築路區之稅收是、工部局討論此問題之代表、將爲費利溥·葛白·及穆邱三人、「市府」方面尙未宜布其代表姓名、惟聞其代表姓名、將於下週初交出、俾便進行嗟商、</p>
<p>若干細則</p>
<p>協定之最後須加考慮者、爲特區華方法院之管轄權、官方認爲此項問題、諒難解決、因有許多技術上之點、與此問題有關也、今晨日大使館發言人鶴見憲吿記者稱、日當局與公共租界警務處討論由警務處較充分的管轄浜北公共租界各區事、刻仍在進行中、今猶有「許多細則」須待解決、惟談判已有順利進展云、</p>
<p>土地卷宗</p>
<p>又今晨負責方面解釋土地卷宗經日總領事而移交事稱、工部局從衆所承認之團體接獲此等卷宗、今交還目下之「市府」、實有由負責方面轉手之必要、</p>
<p>所謂困難</p>
<p>本年二月間、工部局與「市府」簽訂協定、雖屬默予「市府」以事實上之承認、惟就技術上言、「市府」並非負責團體、抑雙方今有早日作更具體方式的承認之可能、蓋「市長」傳筱菴已尤與工部局當局更密切合作、而工部局亦欲解除本巿現遇之種種困難也、</p>
<p>兪氏抗議</p>
<p>關於卷宗事、前上海市長兪鴻鈞已提抗議、惟今晨工部局方面對此拒不發表任何言論、據上項卷宗、係一九三七年滬戰中、華軍西撤後、由兪鴻鈞市長交工部局保管者、</p>
<h3>法日成立協定　法租界維現狀　歐仁表示各不作有損對方行動</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報云、今日（四日）聞諸負責方面、上海日軍當局已向木市法當局保證維持上海法租界之完整及該區之現狀、此項妥協、乃法日當局上週談妥影響本市局勢之事件時商定者、今晨日官方對於此事、雖拒不發言、惟駐滬法總領事歐仁表示、雙方當局已獲此諒解、據稱、「吾人同意各不作有損對方之任何行動、此乃日當局與否人間之君子協定，」</p>
<p>商訂協定　附有條款</p>
<p>據另一方面透露法日當局就法租界問題商獲協定之細則稱、日當局除實際上保證法租界之完整外、並與法當局在協定中訂立「秘密條款」、規定在雙方同意之「指定年數」內、繼續保持法租界之現狀、其他細則、尙未可知、惟聞雙方當局日後將全力合作、至於政治問題及日當局有權參加偵查法租界內從事政治活動之人、則法日當局業已獲得諒解、</p>
<p>西報評論　暫獲小康</p>
<p>據今日出版之英文密勒氏評論報云、歐戰之不祥結果、使法人對於遠東之態度、無暇兼籌並顧、在此法人紛紛以經濟及人力支持祖國、不遺餘力、因此本埠法租界之管理及保衛問題、遂日趨嚴重、此種新形勢之發生、致使法當局將徐家匯區實行「移交」日方、在</p>
<p>目前環境之下、卽保持充分防軍力量、以護衛法租界、亦成嚴重問題、日方對於法租界雖極願予以「協助」、但法當局顯欲利用外交手腕、婉拒日方此種「好意」之請求、以法國人之觀點而論、法國力弱、故不能不利用環境、竭力維持現狀、在必要塲合、亦不得不</p>
<p>被迫讓步是故素以對日不妥協著稱之前法總領事波德、已因體弱而辭職、目前日法關係、可稱爲「友好」、然而同時亦甚緊張、日方固得隨時與法決裂、但日方目前顯然不致出此一着、蓋現下情形對日</p>
<p>頗為有利</p>
<p>某重要法國官員稱、「日本現仍陷於在華戰事之泥沼中、故對於上海法租界、僅視爲藏於冰箱之美味食品、俟時機一至、彼將時刻準備從容大嚼也」</p>
<h3>米糧評價會成立　港米起運</h3>
<p>當局嚴禁越軌交易</p>
<p>上海市豆米行業同業公會自經議決組織上海米糧評價委員會、專責辦理米糧評價、疏通來源·統計·調查·登記已到未到米糧等、業已徵得兩租界當局同意、並推定豆米行業陳子彝等廿一人爲當然委員、茲該會業已定於今日下午三時假座愛多亞路十五號召開成立大會、屆時除修正通過章程外、並將協商各項重要議案、以穩定滬巿整偭米市爲目的、</p>
<p>當局協助</p>
<p>豆米行業雜糧業米號業、昨日推派陳子彝等再度晋謁公共租界工部局何副總辦、當由何氏親自接見、首由各代表分別報吿畢、並面邀兩租界當局予以派員參加、指示機宜、何氏除尤協助外、並卽面諭切實辦理、嗣後如有越軌交易、私做暗盤者、卽須報告當局懲處、各該代表自辭別何氏後、再赴市商會、當由該會秘書嚴諤聲親自接見、嚴氏已尤予考憲、</p>
<p>港米起運</p>
<p>香港當局前為防範萬一起見、準備强迫疏散歐洲旅港婦孺、令飭禁止船隻出口、作疏散人口之用、以致已裝米糧輪船無法離港來滬、然滬市一般米蠧竟復活躍、揚言洋米來源中斷、一時市塲人心堅挺、米價再度上漲、幸經兩租界當局設法抑平米價、取締投機、迄今卒吿維持原盤、新聲社記者昨向米業界探悉、存港洋米數達十二萬餘包、現港當局已准船隻出口、存米均已絡續起運、日內裝怡和公司泰生輪、太古公司綏陽輪將有五萬包運抵、至於定米四船、業已抵埠、聞裝米二萬餘包、</p>
<h3>德情報專員　否認媾和</h3>
<p>駐滬德大使館悄報專員柯德、於昨日在招待中外新聞記者席上、對於目前歐洲之局勢、發表談話、據稱、在軍事方面、德國已準備新局勢、以對付英國、此種工作、將迅速澈底完成、觀於</p>
<p>海空兩軍</p>
<p>最近在各港口海岸之活躍、可以見其一斑、關於駐滬德總領署召集一九一一年級兵役服務之布吿、因華文報紙記載、略有誤會之處、柯氏特加以詮釋、謂此乃係根據一九三五年五月二十一日德國所頒布之兵役法、蓋德國國民年齡滿足十八歲時、卽須</p>
<p>應召受檢</p>
<p>在國內者向主管軍事機關報到、在國外則向各該駐在地領署呈報云、最後大中社記者曾叩詢關於最近報章刊載英德和議之消息、是否確實、據該發言人負責表示、所謂英德議和之謠傳、雖報章予以刊載、惟可</p>
<p>負責證明</p>
<p>此種宣傳、決非德國最高當局所發來、因此德國曾步英國後塵、對此新聞亦加以否認、蓋歐戰迄今、所謂協約國者、均經德國予以個別擊破、故目今歐戰形勢、已成德國對英之單獨作戰、安有議和之可言哉、</p>

<h3>商輪兵險加價　法屬各地及法商輪拒收　英商保險業仍履行條件</h3>
<p>自歐戰爆發後、國際形勢瞬息萬變、航行上之安全問題、日趨嚴重、經營保險業者、先則不收受運往北歐及地中海一帶之商輪兵險、頃又決定暫時不收受往法屬各地或直屬法國之商輪兵險、至往其他各地之輪船兵險費再度加價、（一）英國及愛爾蘭者每百元收十元、（二）非洲（赤道以南、每百元收四元、（三）西非洲者（赤道以北）每百元收五元、（四）波斯灣者每百元收三元、（五）美洲經好望角者每百元收五元、（六）美洲經巴拿馬運河者每百元收一元、（七）美洲經太平洋者每百元收一元、（八）澳洲者每百元收二元、（九）中國日本菲律賓者每百元收一元、（十）香港以西各埠者　至星洲及荷屬東印度）每百元收一元五角、（十一）星洲以西各埠及印度者每百元收三元、以上係山香港起算、業已實行、</p>
<p>英商保險　業務不變</p>
<p>本市洋商保檢業、英商居重要地位、自第二次歐戰發生後、發生種種疑問、與保及承保間、有不安影象、但本年二月間英國衆議院開會時、由彼的羅蘭士議員詢問財相、當由西門爵士答復、對於英商保險公司海外營業、並不變更、仍照保單之條件履行、茲錄議案如下、</p>
<p>外幣賠款　照單履行</p>
<p>英國衆議院本年二月八日議案抄錄問題—保險公司（海外營業）、議員彼的羅蘭士（問）財政大臣、財政部之金融條例、對英國各保險公司之海外營業、尤其是對於外幣賠款、有無牽制、西門爵士（答）稱、本部已有完全之計劃、貢國保險公司之海外營業、得以暢通無阻、並對於凡聯軍中立國與英國各保家之賠償、無論是英幣或外幣、均按其保單之條件履行、</p>
<h3>平賣煤球期近</h3>
<p>上海巿機製煤球業同業公會於上月二十五日召開第三十六次各廠代表聯席會議、決於七月十一日起繼辦理第七期平賣煤球、定期十天、發售至二十日止、爲期已迫、該業公會已定於本月九日下午三時在天津路會所召開第三十七决各廠代表聯席會議、屆時聞將討論（一）請決定平賣地址、（二）規定每人每决購球數量、暨售價、據悉各界渴望該會對於非平賣煤球、予以核减售價、以輕平民負擔、探悉近日有大量抵埠、卸囤浦東滬西各堆棧、况最近水脚已趨减低、故煤球製造成本不無减輕矣、</p>
<h3>前日彩虹繞日係　濕雲反映成輝　在南北兩極處時有發現</h3>
<p>據法文上海日報云、前日下午一·二·時間、天空發現奇象、卽在晴天炎日之下、有五彩虹之繞日是也、據若干人之推測、此似與未來之氣候有關、而迷信者則稱、上海之局面、殆將有巨大之變動、依若干有經騐之華人談、此種晴虹現象、以應爲洪水或颶風卽將降臨之預兆、亦未可知、但據徐家滙天文臺神父稱、此殆爲一種日暈、在南北兩極處固時有發現者、但在滬地、則當較少耳、按此日暈、其原理實與虹同、卽在地面與日光之間、有濕雲相隔、乃以組成三稜鏡之作用、而發出五彩光芒、據該臺神父云、此種之現象、確爲大風預兆、惟依現時觀之、則本埠之附近、並無颶風將至、而南海之颶風、尙逗留於加羅林島、距滬尙遠、</p>
<p>日暈原因</p>
<p>七月三日下午一時半、太陽四週忽現五彩奇形、一時傳爲奇觀、實卽日暈、凡各種氣象之光之異景、統以此名詞稱之、日暈之來源、爲冰屑所結之雲、被日光照之反射而成、如日光環之由水點而成同、但日暈之形態變境多過日光環、因冰屑形狀甚雜、故日光由冰屑反射而出、能曲折多變、日暈能知雲之性質、譬如天色淡白、並非爲落沙天、實因白細卷雲所致、如此天氣易有日暈、且每爲大風之兆、俗謂「月暈風」、</p>
<p>普通形狀</p>
<p>普通日暈之形狀、內圈半徑、約得二十二度、紅色在內、有時亦有黃色、餘色雜而不能細辨、環中之色、大抵較他處天色闇而不淸、在外之大圈、半徑的得四十六度、色更淡、然各色均能淸分、紅在內而紫在外、以上二種俱係習見之日暈、然平時所見、均爲雲掩全天空而不能均勻、故不能如此次所見之淸麗、月暈與日暈司、</p>
<h3>老沙遜洋行　訴請加租　集成藥房等反對</h3>
<p>公共租界工部局議決自本年秋季起、增加地捐房捐等稅、並已正式公告、於七月一日開始微收、而自來水公司則已先於上月將水費高度增加、以上三項捐費、影響全體市民生活、非常鉅大、且復足以引起增加房租事件、故邇來華洋業主已有藉口地捐水費支出俱增、向二房東</p>
<p>提出加租</p>
<p>而二房東更以房捐亦加爲理由、通吿三房客加租之事、陸續發生、此種糾紛、現正方興未艾、昨晨莫潤華推事審理英商老沙遜洋行訴請判令集成藥房·老大房茶食店·等六戶、自本年七月份起至明年六月底止、各照現有房租金額</p>
<p>加租三成</p>
<p>一案論令原被吿律師轉　其當事人、相互讓步、進行和解、但房客方面之律師、卽將被吿不能接受加租之原因、當庭解釋、謂老沙遜已於去年一年之間、兩度以水費增加爲由、向各被吿爲變相之加租、雖其於房票上載明所加係屬水費、俾租戶在支付房捐方面、稍得利益然水費縱貴、究有限度、</p>
<p>若再增加</p>
<p>設被工部局捐務處發覺、殊與租戶不利、况今乃第三度加租、實難接受云云、而原吿之律師、則以年來關於地產及建築物料皆已漲價、其他各項支出均增、必須加租三成、始堪收支相抵、雙方辯論後、因尊重庭上勸吿、一致聲明出外</p>
<p>試行和解、聞老沙遜注行在南京路河南路轉角（卽拋球塲）一帶所置房屋甚多、此次向全部租戶加租、至爲堅決、共中一部份租戶已在相當條件之下、和平解決云、</p>

<h3>星期廉價衣料</h3>
<p>— 適望</p>
<p>生活的壓迫眞使人喘不過氣來，雖然抱定了節衣縮食的座右銘度着日子，但是縮不能縮到腸胃里沒有東西，節也要顧到勉强可以蔽體。在戰後的第三個夏天，我的夏季衣服實在再不能穿着上辦公室了，於是三思而行，決定捨棄西服，改穿中裝。因爲西服的料子都是所謂「來路貨」，以僅有的法幣去折合外匯售價，一襲西服的製辦，或許眞要使合家的腸胃里眞沒有東西消化了。穿中裝呢，那些紗綢之類，自然也休想染指的，卽是起碼的布料，也在投機朋友的「電話聲中」驚人的「冒上」了。所以計劃雖然決定，在跑過了幾家綢緞局及布莊之後，還是遲遲不敢「熱行」。終至恿笨到每天讀報紙上的廣吿，希望萬一碰到行麼不顧血本的大廉價機會。果然天從人願，在某一個星期日的早上，發現一個不可多得的機會。從廣吿上的價目計算起來，做一件長衫，兩套衫褲，大概連縫工在內，還可以少過二十元。於是顧不得這是休息日子，也起了個大早，趕去買便宜貨了。然而還是失望地歸來，原因是「賣完了！」</p>
<p>便宜貨自然是大家想塌的，所以祇限於星期日上午這短短時間，但是已經登了廣吿，不能够隨隨便便，甚至是跡近欺騙，因爲我那天去的時候自問是够得上一個「早」字的，這「賣完了」就不能不使人懷疑根本沒有便宜貨出售。</p>
<p>戰後的綢緞局及布莊，可以說都是賺錢的，每星期早上揀幾種衣料作爲犧牲品，也不致便宜到虧本的程度，那末何必用欺騙的手段，尋窮朋友的開心呢？同時這是有損商業道德，並且也是破壞自己信譽的自殺政策！所以，如果確是誠意犧牲，至少應該規定一個時間，在規定時間儘量發售。否則，乾脆專售高貴衣料，窮人此路不通！</p>
<h3>荒年大肚皮</h3>
<p>— 同代人</p>
<p>常言道：「荒年大肚皮。」這句話，倒是很有科學根據的。第一：米荒的年頭，其他的食物決不會便宜，點心雜食少吃的結果，飯自然要多吃了。第二：米貴，肉類油類以及種種蔬菜都貴，米省不來，祗好在下飯的小菜上省，小菜少吃，米就要多吃；同時肉食油料减少以後，肚子裏脂肪缺乏，消化得又快又容易，換句話說，便是愈會餓，愈吃得下飯。</p>
<p>荒年而大社皮，眞是不幸中的大不幸，但是舉目都是只顧自己的肚皮而不顧大衆肚皮的「蛀虫」。嗚呼！</p>
<p>霍桑探案</p>
<h3>舞后的歸宿</h3>
<p>— 程小靑著</p>
<p>第二章　「一頁往史！」</p>
<p>我對於金梅的心事已有相當的瞭解。伊的口氣分明要把嫌疑歸在趙伯雄身上，同時又竭力給余甘棠洗刷。其實但聽伊對於這兩個人的不同的稱呼，便可洞燭伊的心理上的愛憎。但伊爲什麼如此呢？</p>
<p>我不禁挿口說：「王小姐在他們倆爭鬧時旣然幫趙伯雄說話，分明伊對於姓趙的感情，比姓余的更密切。那末，道姓趙的昨晚上爲什麼又有要找伊爲難的樣子？」</p>
<p>金梅祗向我斜睨了一下，低垂了頭，目光凝視著地毯，不理會我。</p>
<p>倪金壽也贊附我的見解，接續說：「對！這有些說不通。金梅，你說啊。」</p>
<p>伊簡單地回答：「我不知道。」</p>
<p>霍桑對於我和倪金壽的問句似乎不感興趣。他仍自顧自地機續問道：「金梅，昨天余甘棠到底來過沒有？」</p>
<p>伊仍搖搖頭說：「沒有。」伊依舊在欣賞地毯上的圖案。</p>
<p>霍桑注視著伊，語氣也加重了些。「你要說實話才好。」</p>
<p>金梅勉强道：「我不知道。」</p>
<p>「那才對。余甘棠昨天也許也來過，不過你沒有知道。對嗎？……好，余甘棠做什麼生意的？」</p>
<p>「他不做生意。他在江南大學裏讀書。」</p>
<p>「唔，一僩大學生！」他沉默了一下，似乎在暗暗嘆氣。接着他忽似想起了一個新的話題。「唉，我忘記了，昨夜裏你跟李老爺聽得了槍聲下樓的時候，那個老媽子怎麼樣？」</p>
<p>金梅答道：「伊還在房裏沒有出來。」</p>
<p>「伊也住在三層樓上嗎？」</p>
<p>「不，伊睡在樓下在廚房後面。」</p>
<p>「伊難道不曾聽得槍聲？」</p>
<p>「伊說沒有聽得，直得老毛出去找陸經埋跟姜小姐以後，我才進吳媽的房裏去叫醒伊。」　（三五）</p>
<h3>慕爾堂白飯加價　代貧民呼籲</h3>
<p>— 維康</p>
<p>本埠虞洽卿路慕爾堂因米價飛漲，貧民生活困難，年前就發售平價白飯，每斤國幣一角，每日上午發售，嘉惠貧民，實屬非淺。但「僧多粥少」，白飯常不敷分配，因此每日向隅者佔大多數。最近忽聞該堂因購飯貧民過多，爲稍予限制起見，特定於木日起將售價略予提高，每斤改售國幣一角五分。該堂此舉，使我們聽了實覺得非常驚訝，同時更不得不代爲貧民呼籲！</p>
<p>慕爾堂這决加價的理由是限制人數，但請大家靜心想一想，這羣被淘汰在一角五分價目下的貧民，他們將怎麼樣？造成更極悲慘的後果是可以想見的。這不是和慕爾堂賣白飯來救濟貧民的主旨相背馳嗎？</p>
<p>因此故我們不得不請慕爾堂從長計議，因爲「限制人數而加價」不是一個良好的辦法，同時更不能恃爲加價的理由！同時希望上海慈善家慈善團等從速設法，共襄慕爾堂的廉售白飯救濟貧民的善舉，使它永遠做到嘉惠貧民的目的。</p>
<h3>「補助淸寒學生」補正</h3>
<p>— 王沛</p>
<p>三日本刋西蒙君之「男女靑年會補助淸寒學生」一文，其中略有錯誤，筆者向受該會補助，故所知較詳，現略爲補充及改正於下：</p>
<p>該會創辦於民國念六年秋季「八一三」事變後，宗旨在補助上海受戰事損害之優秀畢生，使能繼續學業。定名爲「上海學生救濟委員會」。款項則由靑年會向美國敎會及學校募得。</p>
<p>補助金額高中學生每名五十元，專科以上學生每名七十元。（西蒙君所云高中學生三十元，專科學生五十元，這是上屆的補助金額，本屆因各校學費增加，故補助金也隨之增加。）請求補助的學生自七月一日起可到靜安寺路女靑年會學生生活互助社領取「申請救濟學生登記表」，領表時並無其他手續。該表須在八日前連同成績單或其他證明文件及照片兩張親自繳進。（最好在六日以前繳進，因爲該會本月九日就要舉行考試，而七日又不辦公，八日繳進恐時間上太侷促。）該表塡得愈詳細愈好，因爲塡得太簡單，使委員會看了無從得知其家庭是否淸寒，品學是否優良，尤其爲本人之特長，課外活動，課外看何種書報雜誌，及家庭經濟情形較爲重要。而下學期本人之經濟預算表更須詳盡，藉以得知請求者是否需要補助。繳表時卽可領取准考證，考試的地點是在南京路慈淑大樓六樓之江大學，時間是七月九日下午七時至九時。考試的內容不外乎普通常識及時事。揭曉期的在考試後一星期左右。初試及格尙須複試（口試），複試及格便可領取補助金了。受補助學生每星期須擔任數小時的義務工作。</p>
<p>該會補助學生額本爲二百名（專科大學及中學各半），現因上海失學靑年日漸增加，故本屆增加一百名，中學錄取一百五十名，大學及專科一百五十名。需要補助的學生可以趕快去領取表格，因為該表尙須學校，保證人，及家長蓋章，領得太慢恐不及辦理手續。</p>
<h3>敬質靑年會學生部</h3>
<p>— 徐飛</p>
<p>五月裏，靑年會學生部舉辦了一决徵文。題目是「今日之上海學生」。體裁分小說，報吿，雜文等幾種。五月二十日截稿。優勝的前十名，各贈書券五元，並得申請下學期學費的補助金。十名以後及不錄取的，也都送「今日之上海學生」彙編一冊。揭曉的日期是六月一日。此項徵文消息，各報均有刊登。各學校也均收到該會所寄發的章則。那時，筆者就寫了一篇稿子寄去，然而六月一日並沒有揭曉。以後，每天關切地翻報，並向接近靑年會方面的朋友探詢，也並無動靜。一位老同學吿訴我：他只聽說有一决基督敎徒的徵文，但並非「今日之上海學生一，已經結束，其他的並無所知。於是我在猜疑以外，直接寫信到靑年會學生部去詢問，可是仍舊沒有答覆。現在七月一日也過去了，還是不見揭曉。</p>
<p>因此，我不得不誠意地請求靑年會學生部的執事先生來公開答覆了，這次徵文究竟是怎麼一回事？到底幾時才能揭曉呢？（却酬）</p>
<h3>防疫·消毒</h3>
<p>— 梅子</p>
<p>匡錫華君的「打防疫針」一文，他對於一般不懂防疫針爲何物的人們，可以說是解釋得至詳且盡了。在這毒辣的夏日開始的時候，每個人可以不必遲疑地去打防疫針了。但是在馬路上施打防疫針的白衣天使有些太敷衍從事。譬如他拿了一管藥水，拉住了行人，就接連的在各個皮膚下注射，分量的多少旣不注意，卽針頸也不用火酒拭拭消毒，在這輕易的疏忽中，或許會遭致過不幸的後果呢。另一面我們自然也原諒他們，因爲馬路上行人過多，不能像在醫院中那樣的從容注射，但是注意下述兩點：是並不十分麻煩的事，注射藥水不宜過多；針頭則在每次注射後都應消毒。這是每個醫生的責任，不要因爲是盡義務而忽略了。</p>

<h3>世界瞬息萬變　拍時事片的困難</h3>
<p>— 新影</p>
<p>好來塢的影片公司，最近都想拍攝一些時事片，但國際方面的事件變化得實在太快了。影片公司編好了一個劇本，想要開拍影片的時候，國際局勢已完全改觀，不得不改變計劃，中止拍攝。結果目前好萊塢拍攝的影片，有關歐洲的時事者，也就衹有一部，就是派拉蒙的「神秘船」（Mystery　Ship。這部影片，所描寫的雖然是關於烏拉圭附近的海戰，但內中包括一部北海的戰事。</p>
<p>的確，好萊塢有不少故事，是敍述歐戰的情影，尤其是德國的納粹主義像米高梅的「逃亡」（Escape）和「死亡的狂潮」（Mortal　Storm）。都是屬於這一類的影片。</p>
<p>環球有一部新片，故事取材戰事新聞，在芬蘭戰事結束時拍攝完成的，叫做「海上巡哨」（Sea　Patrol）。這種傾向，現在已普遍於好萊塢這影城之中，一般影片公司都想打新聞紙上找取題材，把時事編成故事，拍攝影片。而唯一的缺點，就在國際事件委實變得太快，影片公司就是用最敏捷的手段，有時也來不及拍時間性的影片。</p>
<p>在這种情形之下，好萊塢的電影劇作家「最近工作就特別忙。發現了可以採作電影題材的新事件，在影片公司授　之下，就根據新聞報導，很快的寫成劇本，使公司可迅速拍戲，這種傾向，自去年九月，歐洲　事發生之後，格外來得顯明了！</p>
<h3>唐若英的戲劇生活</h3>
<p>— 風陵</p>
<p>這似乎不用介紹的，關於唐若英小姐，就按因為家學淵源，在她的戲劇生活準很充實。果然不錯，當我會見若英小姐，和她談話一次後，我的理想完全給證實了：</p>
<p>八一三戰爭的烽火沒有爆發前，她是很安逸地，在虹口北四川路啟秀女子中學讀書，畢業後，預備再進蘇州東吳大學，而且已經錄取了，不料戰事發生，全家人都打從劇團組織中，旅征各地演劇，努力戲劇本位的鼓吹工作，在她當然也是跟隨前往的。當她讀書時候，因為天性的遺傳關係，戲劇的興趣非常濃厚，常以校團名義，表演獨幕的短劇，不過從未正式踏上舞台一次。</p>
<p>到了漢口，她們在那裏經過長期的旅居，她一面就讀於某女校，一面却是正式從事于戲劇生活了，第一次演出者，那是歐陽予倩先生所編的「青紗帳裏」。後來再往香港，其中有半年左右的時期，若青單獨去到桂林工作，因此中旅「夜光杯」「雷雨」「日出」各劇，就都歸她主演，彈指算來，差不多已有一年半以上的光景了。</p>
<p>如今，她在震旦大學文學院讀書，因為暑假期中，所以能夠抽出一部份的時間，客串表演各劇，這次的「女店主」，她在劇中主演女店主杜九姑娘，故事性上非常幽默風趣，純以喜劇的姿態演出，在她，可說迎合個性了的。</p>
<h3>現在菲島表演之滬星國劇團台柱戚美玉卽綠牡丹之舞裝（秀珍贈刊）</h3>
<h3>傘兵隊上銀幕</h3>
<p>— 新</p>
<p>在這次歐戰中，德國的傘兵隊是給予全世界人士一個又奇又驚的讚譽，誰都急於要知道，德國是怎樣在訓練這种神威的兵士的。</p>
<p>現在，關於這個問題，德國方面已經拍成了一張影片：六月初拍柏林當局在招待外國新聞記者的時候，已把這張影片介紹給了他們：據聞不久後，卽將在各地的影戲院上映呢。</p>
<p>看完了該片後，任何人對於「傘兵隊」這名詞，是更會感到興趣了。原來傘兵隊首先是需要經過陸軍訓練，他們每日規定有一種戶內運動，就是在厚毯上練習翻觔斗，對於從飛機上跳下來的技能，實習的方法係從高建築物上跳至地下已掘成的沙坑。此外，另有几積課程亦是必須授給每個傘兵的，最主要的是在着陸過程時怎樣能夠處置自如。該片最後的一部就是屬於表演他們的神威，他們用輕捷軍器是在着陸時裝在箱子內從飛機上同時挪下的。傘兵隊上銀幕後，在電影事業方面言，亦可以說記下了一種有史以來所未有的奇跡呢！</p>
<h3>湯傑與朱冰心　—有重溫舊好的可能</h3>
<p>— 太公</p>
<p>以「王先生」影片著稱影壇的湯傑，是遠在他十九歲時就進入了電影圈，說起歷史來，着實也很悠久。</p>
<p>關於湯傑與朱冰心的事，以前曾鬧了好久，後來以某種關係，二人就脫離關係而分袂了，現在，朱冰心在香港，從事摟抱生涯。</p>
<p>昨日，筆者在路途中與湯傑相値，言談之下，得悉湯傑對於朱冰心，始終沒有忘情過，据湯言，不久他曾修函到香港朱冰心，說明了自己的愛情，是並沒有忘記她一天，此信發齣後數日，湯傑勢頭得朱的回函，說叫她回滬重歸舊好，那並不是不可能的事，而且她亦很高興，不過就是還得等二月後才能實行，所為何故，信中也沒說明。</p>
<p>照這樣看來，湯傑與朱冰心的重溫舊好，是可以很順利地實現的，那末且看着二月後湯朱二人的重溫舊夢了。</p>

<h3>Hong Kong Border Blockade Issue: British-Japanese Negotiations Reportedly Broken Down; British Women and Children Remaining in Hong Kong Scheduled for Complete Evacuation Today; Authorities Determined to Complete Evacuation Plan with Mandatory Registration</h3>
<p>Hong Kong - Today, Hong Kong experienced heavy rain all day, and the city was calm. British women and children are scheduled to be completely evacuated by the fifth. So far, only over two thousand have registered, far from the expected number. Generally, people believe the situation has gradually calmed down, hence the reluctance to evacuate. However, the Hong Kong government is determined to complete the evacuation plan and will implement mandatory registration. Passenger traffic on ships traveling between Hong Kong and Shanghai, Hong Kong and Macau, and Hong Kong and the Philippines is exceptionally crowded. Both flights by Pan American Airways are fully booked, and over a hundred people are still without reservations. Although Japanese troops have been closing the Hong Kong border since the 3rd, vegetables are still being smuggled into British territory. The Japanese army can only handle the three locations of Lo Wu, Man Kam To, and Sha Tau Kok. The new Governor, Sir Geoffrey Northcote, is expected to arrive in Hong Kong by the end of the month. It is Britain's consistent policy to have military personnel oversee key regional affairs, demonstrating the British determination to defend Hong Kong. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Hong Kong - News tonight: Negotiations between the Hong Kong government and Japanese authorities to allow Chinese people to pass through the Hong Kong border into the mainland have reportedly broken down due to Japanese dissatisfaction. (4th United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Hong Kong - The foreign population of Hong Kong will continue to decrease tomorrow, with 2,160 women and children leaving for Manila. This second batch of evacuees will depart on the Japanese Queen and Russian Queen liners. Today, registration and luggage transportation matters are extremely busy at the evacuation assembly points. Large quantities of luggage are being transported by trucks. Several areas in downtown Hong Kong have banned private vehicle parking to avoid hindering traffic. All evacuation matters for tomorrow are fully prepared. The embarkation of over two thousand women and children should be orderly. The government guarantees the comfort of the evacuees during the journey, as evidenced by the notice that two Chang Hing Company postal ships have been chartered for this purpose. The Russian Queen is expected to arrive tonight. The Japanese Queen, which carried the first batch of evacuees to Manila, is also expected to return here tomorrow morning. It is expected that the total number of people evacuated from Hong Kong to Manila will reach 9,000. (4th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Hong Kong - According to Japanese sources here, some pro-Japanese Chinese residents in Hong Kong have also begun to evacuate, flocking to Guangzhou for refuge. It is also heard that some German and Italian merchants and missionaries who have not been detained are also moving to Guangzhou. (4th Express News Dispatch)</p>
<p>Hong Kong - When the Hong Kong government authorities dispatched work teams to set up barbed wire fences along the border, villagers and farmers in and around the New Territories voluntarily came out to assist with the work and distributed fruit to the soldiers. Their actions were highly commended by the British garrison commander. (3rd Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>Hong Kong - The Hong Kong government authorities encourage British subjects here to join the Volunteer Defence Corps, sometimes even forcing them to join the Corps for service. The Hong Kong Daily News recently commented on this matter, saying, "The way for overseas Chinese to serve the country lies in voluntarily joining the Defence Corps." Furthermore, there are no racial restrictions for those who volunteer to join the Defence Corps; even those who are not purely European may register to participate. (3rd Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Fierce Battles in Western and Southern Shanxi</h3>
<p>Tongguan - More than a thousand Japanese troops in Liulin, Western Shanxi, launched a fierce attack on the mine opening on the 19th under the cover of artillery fire. Chinese troops met them head-on with heavy blows, resulting in extremely fierce fighting. Another unit of Chinese troops crossed the Yellow River eastward, penetrating deep into the central areas of Sanjiao, Lishi, and Liulin, cutting off the Japanese rear lines and, at the same time, echoing with the frontal Chinese forces, attacking from both sides, annihilating many Japanese troops. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Luoyang - The Japanese troops in the area of Bozi Jing, Guanchezhen, Shanxi, are constantly attacked by Chinese troops, and traffic is cut off. The Japanese army is extremely panicked. On the 2nd, a unit of over a thousand Japanese troops, with two artillery pieces, harassed the Chinese forces from the west side of the highway. Chinese troops intercepted them head-on, and fierce fighting is currently underway in the Heyuandonglongju area. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Xiangdong Area: Chinese Troops Capture Various Strongholds One After Another, Completely Controlling the Outskirts of Sui County</h3>
<p>Xiangyang - Chinese troops in the Xiangdong area have captured various strongholds, including Changshoudian, and are advancing to encircle Yangzi and Zhongxiang, sweeping through the area. A unit continued to capture Gaotugeng and attacked Dushupo, while another unit reached Leidudun, completely controlling the outskirts of Sui County. All the remaining Japanese troops in various locations have been more than half annihilated by the Chinese forces, and the fierce offensive continues. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Northern Jiangsu: Chinese Troops Achieve Victory</h3>
<p>A Certain Location in Northern Jiangsu - At 3:00 AM on the 17th, a unit of Japanese troops from Chezhou, south of Gaoyou, advanced towards Bajiaqiao. At the same time, Japanese troops from Santai invaded the eastern flank. Chinese troops met them head-on, launching fierce battles. After fighting until the evening, the Japanese troops were unable to withstand the pressure and fled in disarray. In this battle, over three hundred Japanese soldiers, including the Japanese commander, Captain Seimei, were killed, and over a hundred rifles, nine boxes of ammunition, four boxes of shells, over twenty tents, and many other military supplies were seized. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Warships Damaged on Dongting Lake</h3>
<p>Changsha - Japanese warships on Dongting Lake have been harassing areas such as Luxiwan, Guhupu, and Junshan in recent days. Chinese troops have repeatedly shelled them, inflicting heavy damage on the Japanese. Between the 1st and 2nd, a total of two Japanese warships and five Japanese boats were sunk, and many more were damaged. In addition, a powerful unit of the Chinese army launched a fierce attack on the Japanese forces on the outskirts of Yueyang, causing extreme panic among the Japanese after two days of fierce fighting. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops in Southern Guangxi Failed to Invade the West</h3>
<p>Front Line in Southern Guangxi - Since the 21st, Japanese troops on the Yonglong Road have been harassing the west again. Chinese troops have been fighting back step by step. On the 29th, a fierce battle took place near Mingjiang. At dawn on the 30th, Japanese troops fled in two directions: one group retreated with injuries to Niuxu (northeast of Mingjiang), and the other group crossed the Mingjiang River northward. Chinese troops have been blocking them separately. (3rd Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Guizhou Provincial Government Severely Punishes Corruption and Dereliction of Duty</h3>
<p>Guiyang - The Guizhou Provincial Government severely punishes corruption and dereliction of duty. From January of last year to June of this year, there have been more than twenty cases in total.

<p>Chongqing - According to a Chinese military spokesperson, the Japanese military authorities are currently constructing an airfield in Yichang. In the future, Japanese planes flying to Chongqing may become more intense. However, the spokesperson also said that although the Japanese army is building an airfield, they may not necessarily be able to use it, as Chinese troops are stationed nearby, and the Chinese Air Force has also been frequently bombing Japanese positions in Yichang recently. The spokesperson acknowledged that Japanese troops occupied Longzhou on June 1st and Zhennanguan on June 29th. Both of these locations are cities on the Vietnamese border. The Japanese army's occupation of these cities is a prelude to invading Vietnam. (4th United Press Dispatch)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The International Situation in the Eyes of the British and Americans</h3>
<p>We do not feel that Britain is aging. Especially after the end of the Western Front battles, we feel that its spirit is vigorous and its power is pervasive. In matters as significant as deciding to continue fighting alone, and as minor as deciding to evacuate women and children from Hong Kong as quickly as possible, it acts decisively and relentlessly, demonstrating its strength and determination. However, are these expressions only because it has been stimulated by direct and immediate practical interests? From a certain perspective, observing certain points, it seems that some British ideas reveal a tendency towards aging. At least, regarding international movements, the British judgments and aspirations have become mechanized in their approach due to their traditional successes. We should not ask: why do Stalin, Hitler, and Mussolini not follow established norms? But we cannot help but ask: Chamberlain, immersed in the British tradition of passing on the mantle and preserving orthodoxy, isn't his approach outdated? It's not just Chamberlain. A few words from a New York dispatch in the London Daily Telegraph the day before yesterday: "Although the interests of the Soviet Union and Japan in the Far East are irreconcilable, democratic countries may temporarily benefit from it, but fundamentally, doomed powers, including other dictatorships, will eventually collude." This is not New York news; it is a purely British idea. Similarly, a few words from a New York dispatch in the London Times on the same day: "If the Soviet Union and Germany clash, Japan will quickly move towards the Axis powers and seek to seize or blockade Vladivostok, the Soviet Union's access to the Pacific Ocean. If the Soviet Union and Germany continue to cooperate, Tokyo will be apprehensive and attempt to improve its relations with Britain and the United States." This is also definitely not information from New York; it is a truly traditional British idea. Ideas are not very capable of being based on objective reason; rather, they are often a synthesis of subjective judgments and aspirations. When the British have such ideas, that is, when they make such judgments and aspirations, we cannot help but feel that this is the mechanized approach of the British tradition. The method in his diplomatic history has repeatedly achieved consummation, the mechanized judgment to the present, the mechanized aspiration to the present. But he was wrong!</p>
<p>The irreconcilable nature of the Soviet Union and Japan in the Far East is a public phenomenon. In the past, after Japan forcibly occupied China's Northeast, did the strategists in its government and public first fight the Soviet Union and then covet China, or did they first take China and then fight the Soviet Union? It can be seen that the irreconcilable nature has been long-standing. So why still fear their collusion? Germany and Italy are allies, and they are currently fighting side by side. What contradictions exist between them, we will not speculate for now. As for the Soviet Union and Germany, during Germany's war against Britain, the Soviet Union would certainly not help Britain to the detriment of Germany, and Germany would especially not intensify friction with the Soviet Union. However, the mutual goodwill has its inevitable limits. The more Germany dominates in Europe, the more the Soviet Union and Germany will be on guard against each other. So why also fear their collusion? As for Japan, between the Soviet Union and Germany, because the long-term Sino-Japanese war has deprived Japan of its strength to participate in the Axis powers, and because the European war has deprived Japan of its opportunity to manipulate events from the middle due to the fact that the Soviet Union and Germany will never turn against each other, not only has Japan lost favor with the Soviet Union and Germany, but the Soviet Union and Germany both harbor resentment towards Japan. So why say that these four countries will eventually collude? I believe that the United States wants to sympathize with and support Britain for various reasons, but not because of the British traditional diplomatic idea that someone will collude. Even if "the Soviet Union and Germany clash," Japan will not only definitely not move its remaining forces towards Vladivostok and engage in the so-called seizure or blockade, but will also move the remaining forces at the Soviet-Japanese border towards China. Even if "Tokyo is apprehensive because Germany and the Soviet Union continue to cooperate" and "attempts to improve its relations with Britain and the United States," this would indeed be beneficial to Britain during Britain's war against Germany, but has Britain also planned for this? What price is Britain prepared to pay today in order to obtain Japan's goodwill? Does reality allow it? In short, the era of British diplomacy has passed, and the traditional diplomatic ideas have failed. In the Far East, if it does not want to abandon, it can only resolve to defend itself. Regarding international movements, Americans see more clearly than the British and grasp more firmly. For example, the New York Post, the representative newspaper of the US government party, commented yesterday: "Not only the democratic countries, but also Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union, must oppose any attempt by Japan to control the entire Far East. Japan may make some progress temporarily, but when the European war ends, no matter who wins, Japan will eventually have to yield." We completely agree with this conclusion and believe it can serve as a lesson for the British!</p>
<h3>Stimson and Knox's Statements Outline the Course of US Far East Policy; Implementing Neutrality Will Lead to Shameful Consequences; The US Reaches Understanding with Britain Due to Strategic Relations</h3>
<p>Washington - People here believe that the Tokyo newspapers' report of British-American naval cooperation is due to Japanese concern over the future actions of the American fleet. The only possible reaction from official circles here is that the report is inaccurate. However, this statement only creates an inaccurate impression of the United States' position on the Far East issue. In fact, the State Department has not changed its policy of opposing the Japanese attempt to establish a new order in the Far East. In terms of Atlantic or Pacific naval strategy, what the United States must consider is the possible hostile actions of the Japanese fleet on the one hand and the friendliness obtained by the British fleet on the other, and to adjust its plans accordingly. The result is almost equivalent to Britain and the United States reaching an informal understanding. (4th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Appointment to the Cabinet to be Voted On</p>
<p>Washington - Since the Senate committee passed the appointments of Colonel Stimson and Colonel Knox as Secretary of War and Secretary of the Navy, the Senate prepared last night to submit the move of adding the two men to President Roosevelt's "new mixed cabinet" to a vote. It is widely believed that the Senate's final decision will be delayed until the end of next week because the Senate currently has countless important budget bills urgently awaiting a vote. The Senate Naval Affairs Committee passed a motion yesterday by a vote of nine to five to ask the Senate to confirm Colonel Knox's appointment. As for Colonel Stimson's appointment, it was approved on Tuesday in the Army Committee by a vote of fourteen to three. It is widely expected that the senators who believe that the two new cabinet members will adopt a crisis policy of assisting Britain will make a final opposition to the two colonels in the Senate. However, congressional figures believe that, in any case, the appointment of the two men will eventually be passed. After the Naval Affairs Committee passed Knox's appointment, Committee Chairman Walsh gave a speech praising the publisher of the Chicago newspaper (i.e., Knox), saying that he had "the determination to move forward and a deep understanding of the current situation." Walsh declared, "This committee believes that Colonel Knox has the determination to move forward and a deep understanding of the current situation, and will surely accelerate the rate of our country's naval construction." When the news of his appointment was received, the committee believed that Colonel Knox was a proponent of intervention, so the committee had a tendency to oppose Knox. After listening to the opinions, the committee learned that although Colonel Knox absolutely sympathized with the Allied powers in his opinions, he also declared that he did not advocate directly joining the European war. He advocated that the people could assist the Allied powers morally and economically, but he opposed this kind of economic assistance being carried out by the government. He declared that he opposed the government giving any assistance to other countries that could drag the United States into war or endanger the national defense of the United States. This has already been made clear in public to the committee. During the public hearing in the committee that day, someone asked Knox for his opinion on the country's neutrality law. Knox replied that he was "furious" about the implementation of the neutrality law on China and Japan, because if this case were implemented in the Sino-Japanese War, there would be a shameful consequence on the Far East issue. Isolationist Republican Senator Johnson repeatedly stated that this neutrality law was not implemented in the Far East because President Roosevelt did not recognize the state of war in that area and therefore refused to issue a formal announcement. Knox replied that he opposed the entire neutrality law and advocated returning to international law, but at the same time, he acknowledged that in the current situation, international law was "fragile." (4th United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Washington - The newly appointed Secretary of the Navy Knox and Secretary of War Stimson, expressed their opinions in the Senate's naval and military committees, stressing that America's new front line in the Atlantic, and making plain the course to be followed in US's new Far East policy. Among Knox's opinions, the Senate was most concerned about the fact that he did not believe that the United States could effectively prevent Japan from occupying the Dutch East Indies. Responsible naval figures believe that Knox's view is also true for Vietnam and the Philippines, and why not? Naval figures believe that Knox's remarks are sufficient to break the previous claims of the naval authorities that expanding US naval operations to Southeast Asia and using British Singapore as a base could defeat Japan. The development of the European War has made the defense of the Atlantic Ocean important, so the US's measures in the Far East must be very prudent. Both Knox and Stimson are proponents of a strong Far East policy, but at this time, both men believe that the implementation of the US Far East policy should be particularly prudent in light of the current world situation. For this reason, although the American official attitude is very dissatisfied with the recent visit of Japanese Foreign Minister Nomura to the Philippines, but an exceedingly circumspect one, and no comment has been issued.

<p>Britain, Germany, Italy and the Soviet Union oppose exclusive domination</p>
<p>New York - The New York "Post" yesterday commented on Japan's recently published "East Asia Monroe Doctrine," calling it a "light opera" and urging the US government to ban the export of scrap iron to Japan, saying that it could prevent "our people from continuing to manufacture military supplies for the Japanese." The newspaper pointed out that Japan's declaration of the "Monroe Doctrine" and the implementation of the doctrine are two different things. The newspaper also said that not only democratic countries oppose the Japanese domination of the Far East, but also Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union. Japan may make some progress in the Far East temporarily, but the day will come when Japan will eventually yield, no matter which side wins the European war in the end. At the same time, the "New York Herald Tribune" pointed out that the United States needs tin and rubber produced in the British and Dutch Far East. The newspaper believes that this is the direct reason why the United States is concerned about Japan's current activities in the Far East. The newspaper also said that Japan's current actions are forcing the United States to "appease" Japan, just as the Rome-Berlin Axis did in Europe before. (4th United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo - Authoritative sources here recently stated that the Japanese military is currently planning to ask the government to adopt a strong foreign policy, based on Germany's current actions in Europe. Japanese Minister of War Shunroku Hata discussed with Foreign Minister Hachiro Arita yesterday the means of implementing Foreign Minister Arita's "East Asia Monroe Doctrine." Shunroku Hata also presented Hachiro Arita with the views of the Army authorities. After discussing with Arita, Shunroku Hata immediately convened senior military officers at the Ministry of the Army to report the results of his talks with the Foreign Minister. (4th United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo - A Japanese naval spokesman said that Japan does not feel pleased with the recent remarks by US Senate Naval Affairs Committee Chairman Walsh, who said that the US Navy may have difficulty defeating Japan without British and French cooperation. The spokesman said that the personal remarks of US senators have no impact on Japan's serious concern about the US naval construction program and its Far East policy. He said that Japan only focuses on concrete facts and actions and does not pay attention to empty words. When asked what was meant by "concrete actions," the spokesman enumerated various US actions, such as assisting the Chongqing government, which Japan viewed as improper interference in the Sino-Japanese War, and imposing various economic pressures on Japan. Regarding the speech given by the newly appointed US Secretary of the Navy Knox at the US Senate Naval Affairs Committee, the spokesman commented that it was unwise for the US to attempt to impose "improper interference" on the Far East, because Knox had said at the time that it would be unwise for the US to interfere in the Far East after France's defeat. Referring to Walsh's statement that the US fleet did not want to engage with Japan, the spokesman added, "Japan also does not want to fight with the United States and has no intention of provoking the US fleet, because the policy of the Japanese Navy is based on the principles of 'non-aggression' and 'non-threat.'" The spokesman also said that regarding the situation in Vietnam, although the French authorities have agreed to cut off the transportation of Chongqing's military supplies, it is still too early to comment. The spokesman also said that he could not comment on the incident in which the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of the Army prematurely announced Japan's "East Asia Monroe Doctrine" policy the previous week, because Japanese Foreign Minister Arita had announced this policy to the press a few days ago.

<h3>England Will Reject Blockade Request for Burma Road; Singapore Takes Military Precautions; Japanese Surveillance Personnel Arrive in Hanoi</h3>
<p>Tokyo - British Ambassador Sir Robert Craigie visited Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Koya Masazumi at 10:00 this morning to inform him that the British government's reply regarding the transport of goods through Burma should arrive mid-week. It is reported that the British ambassador clarified the reason for the delay in the reply, stating that the British government had to consult with the governments of its dominions and colonies. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - Regarding the Japanese request for Britain to blockade Burma to cut off the supply of military goods to Chongqing, Japan has not yet received a reply from Britain. The British ambassador also reportedly said that he has not received any instructions regarding the Japanese protest. The Japanese press is making various speculations about what kind of reply Britain will give, with most commentators believing that Britain's delayed reply will inevitably reject Japan's request. A Japanese Navy spokesman told the press that Japan is awaiting Britain's response with "serious concern and firm resolve," and that Japan has not yet received Britain's reply. The spokesman emphasized that prohibiting the import of munitions into Chongqing through Burma is an important prerequisite for dealing with the "China Incident." The spokesman also said that the Japanese people are paying close attention to Britain's delayed response, and that this action is sufficient to arouse the resentment of the Japanese people. Regarding the evacuation of women and children from Hong Kong, the spokesman said that most Japanese people believe that this move by Britain is a common trick to attract the attention of the United States in order to achieve its own goals. The spokesman said that he somewhat agrees with this view. (Associated Press, 4th)</p>
<p>London - Japanese officials here claimed last night that the Japanese government has formally assured Britain that Japan's New East Asia "Monroe Doctrine" does not intend to include Australia within Japan's sphere of control. It is reported that Japan has informed Britain that the "highest end point of Japan's mission of stability" is the Caroline and Marshall Islands in the South Pacific. Reliable sources here confirm reports that Britain intends to reject Japan's request to blockade the Yunnan-Burma Railway, but officials deny reports that British Ambassador to Japan Sir Robert Craigie has already submitted Britain's reply to the Japanese Foreign Ministry. This area is preparing to resist any Japanese forward movements at the expense of Britain. It is believed here that Japan intends to invade French Indochina, and it is suspected that Japan will not encounter serious resistance from France during the attack. It seems too early for Britain to hope that the appointment of Sir Stafford Cripps as the new British Ambassador to the Soviet Union will improve Anglo-Soviet relations. Even the beginning of the improvement of bilateral relations, a barter agreement, has lost interest in both here and Moscow. (Associated Press, 4th)</p>
<p>Stockholm - It has been learned here that Singapore and the Malay Archipelago recently took special military precautions. All neutral ships, unless they have special permits, are not allowed to enter Malay ports. Some ports are completely closed. Even with special permits, entry is not allowed. Although Singapore is recognized as the strongest port in the world, due to the seriousness of the situation in the Far East, it has had to increase its defenses. These measures should not be seen as a result of feeling a "direct threat." (Haitong News Agency, 4th)</p>
<p>Hanoi - More than 30 Japanese civilian and military officials responsible for monitoring the blockade of Vietnam arrived here recently.

<p>Tokyo - According to sources from the Japanese side in Hanoi, the personnel sent by the Japanese government to Vietnam to monitor the cessation of transit of important government military supplies through Vietnam have begun their work. The French authorities are now cooperating sincerely. After the French government accepted Japan's proposal, the first group of these personnel arrived in Haiphong on a Japanese warship. The second group, led by Navy Commander Motoi, arrived in Haiphong on Tuesday. Another group arrived in Hanoi on Wednesday afternoon. (Reuters, 4th)</p>

<p>Chongqing - This afternoon, Japanese planes attacked the western suburbs of Chongqing in three waves. The university district was subjected to fierce bombing again. Chinese fighter planes took off to engage them in fierce combat. The outcome is unknown. An alert was issued at 11:00 AM, when it was heard that several waves of Japanese planes were heading towards Chongqing. It was initially thought that they were flying to Chengdu or Jiading, as it was seen that all the planes were heading west along the Chengdu highway. However, at around 2:30 PM, the planes suddenly turned east and headed towards Chongqing. At exactly 3:00 PM, they flew over Xindu and dropped bombs in the western district, focusing on the university district. Central University in the district has been bombed twice. Yesterday, five waves of Japanese planes flew west towards Chongqing, but due to bad weather, they dropped bombs near Fuling in eastern Sichuan. According to reports received here, Japanese bombers from Hankou flew out on June 30, but due to heavy rain along the way, they failed to reach Chongqing and only dropped bombs in Badong. In addition, Xi'an was recently attacked by bombers flying from Shanxi. (Reuters, 4th)</p>

This is the reason why the government is spending a lot of money to embark on huge production projects. At the same time, the government has also provided economic and technical assistance to private enterprises. (Associated Press, 4th)</p>

<h3>British Navy Attacks French Fleet at Mers-el-Kébir; Deploys Electric Mines to Sever Sea Routes; French Battleship Explodes After Hitting Mine</h3>
<p>Berlin - It is reported that yesterday at 5:50 PM, the British fleet suddenly opened fire on French warships anchored in Mers-el-Kébir. The French battleships Dunkerque and Provence, and the fleet's flagship Mogador, were hit and caught fire. The battleship Bretagne caught fire and sailed out of the port, but unfortunately hit an electric mine and exploded. However, the battleship Strasbourg and five small ships, several torpedo boats, and submarines were able to fight back effectively, break through the blockade, and reach the Mediterranean. (Haitong News Agency, 4th)</p>
<p>Geneva - This morning, an official French statement stated that on the morning of July 3, several British warships appeared near the Mers-el-Kébir naval base. The British admiral demanded that French Fleet Commander Admiral Gensoul surrender or sink the French fleet, and gave them six hours to decide. However, before the six-hour deadline, the British Navy deployed electric mines to sever the sea routes. After the French refused the above request, the British opened fire on the French warships at 5:40 PM. Therefore, the French government ordered the French ships near the British warships in Alexandria to weigh anchor and sail to international waters, even if it meant using force. (Haitong News Agency, 4th)</p>
<p>London - The Ministry of Information announced that in order to ensure that the French fleet would not be used against Britain, steps were taken on the morning of July 3 to place all French ships docked in British ports under British control. This action proceeded smoothly, with only two people injured due to a misunderstanding. At the same time, Britain also made some demands on the French ships docked in North African ports, with the aim of preventing them from falling into German hands, and explained to the French officers commanding the ships that if these conditions could not be accepted, Britain was prepared to take all possible steps to ensure that the ships would not be used to fight against Britain in future wars. The British government expressed its regret that the French naval commander at Mers-el-Kébir refused to accept any of the conditions proposed. As a result, Britain was forced to take action against the French ships there. This action is currently underway. The Prime Minister will make a statement on this matter in the House of Commons today. Mers-el-Kébir is a French naval station in Algiers. According to the estimate of a naval expert, the French Navy ranks second in Europe. Currently, the total number of its main warships is over 180. At the time of the outbreak of the war, its active warships included five battleships, including the Dunkerque and Strasbourg. Before the new 35,000-ton battleships were built in Britain and France, these two ships were the fastest and most modern battleships in the world. There are seven 10,000-ton cruisers equipped with 8-inch guns, twelve "B-class cruisers with a displacement of 6,000 to 8,000 tons and equipped with 6-inch guns, thirty-two small cruisers with a displacement of 3,000 tons, thirty-eight destroyers, thirty-seven escort ships and similar small ships, seventy-seven submarines, including thirty ocean-going submarines, one aircraft carrier and one seaplane carrier, and a large number of auxiliary ships. The French Navy had not suffered much loss before the Mers-el-Kébir incident. In this incident, the French lost seven destroyers. In addition, the first paragraph of the Ministry of Information's statement stated, "We will remember that the French government trusted the promises made by Germany and Italy that the French fleet would not be used to attack their former allies. In the armistice agreement, especially regarding the surrender of the French fleet to the enemy, the British government has completely lost confidence in the promises made by the German and Italian governments, and feels that for its own interests and the hope of restoring France's independence and the integrity of the French Empire, it has no choice but to take timely steps to ensure that the French fleet will not be used by a common enemy to fight against Britain." (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>Prime Minister Announces Details of Naval Battle</p>
<p>London - This afternoon, Prime Minister Winston Churchill explained to the House of Commons the British Navy's plan to prevent the French fleet from falling into German hands. The Prime Minister said, "Yesterday, we unanimously decided to place the larger part of the French fleet under our control, or to use considerable force to make them comply with our conditions." There were two battleships, two light cruisers, several submarines, eight destroyers, and two hundred small minesweepers and anti-submarine ships in the ports of Plymouth and Portsmouth. After notifying the commanders of these ships, we boarded the ships shortly thereafter." The Prime Minister continued, "I must announce with sincere sorrow that Britain had no choice but to find a way to prevent the French fleet from coming under Nazi control. The French government has abandoned the war and placed the entire burden on the shoulders of the British Empire, and it is difficult to expect them to be cautious and not inflict unnecessary damage on their loyal comrades. The only chance for French freedom lies in the final victory of this comrade." The Prime Minister then recounted the conditions that Britain had proposed, such as sending the French fleet to British ports before signing an armistice agreement, which would completely release them from their treaty obligations, but France did not follow through. Admiral Darlan (Commander-in-Chief of the French Fleet) made various statements and even declared one time, but the signed armistice agreement still stipulated that the strength of the French fleet and the part under British control should be placed under German control. At that time, many French ships, unable to reach African ports, sailed into the ports of Plymouth and Portsmouth ten days ago.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister continued, "I must state that the Bordeaux government has inflicted fatal damage on us. They are well aware of the consequences. We are still subjected to a ruthless or even malicious treatment, but this does not come from the French nation (cheers), but from the Bordeaux government. For example, the French had captured more than 400 German airmen, and Reynaud had even handed them over to Britain, but after the Reynaud government fell, they were all handed over to Germany." The Prime Minister continued, "Part of the French fleet anchored at Mers-el-Kébir in Algeria refused to be controlled by Britain to prevent it from falling into German hands, resulting in a battle with the British fleet. In this battle, at least four French ships were sunk, and two others were damaged. Two of the best French warships, the Dunkerque and Strasbourg, several light cruisers, destroyers, submarines, and other various warships were anchored at and near Mers-el-Kébir. Yesterday morning, the French admiral refused to meet with a British officer who went to discuss the status of the French fleet. The officer then presented the fleet with a document, asking them to continue fighting against Germany and Italy. We would then sail to a British port with a reduced number of personnel. If these conditions were not accepted, they were ordered to scuttle their ships within six hours. A British detachment, commanded by Admiral Somerville, went to Mers-el-Kébir, consisting of cruisers and other powerful warships. The admiral had previously helped rescue 100,000 French soldiers in the Battle of Dunkirk. When the French admiral finally rejected the British demands, Admiral Somerville was ordered to complete his task before dark. He then opened fire on the powerful French fleet at 5:58 PM. The French fleet was defended by coastal batteries. The British attack was supplemented by fierce attacks from the air. By 7:50 PM, a French battlecruiser of the Strasbourg class had been damaged, a battleship of the Bretagne class had been sunk, and another had been heavily damaged. Two French destroyers and an aircraft carrier were either sunk or set on fire. The Strasbourg or Dunkerque then sailed out of the port and was pursued by planes. Although a torpedo hit it, it was able to enter Toulon Harbor before being subdued, with the help of other French ships." The Prime Minister concluded, "I fear that there must have been many lives lost among the French fleet and in the port, as the British ships were forced to use the most drastic measures against them and witnessed violent explosions."</p>
<p>The diplomatic corps seats were full during the Prime Minister's speech. Many diplomats were in attendance, including Soviet Ambassador Maisky and Chinese Ambassador Guo Taiqi.

<p>London - Details of how the French ships docked in British ports were brought under British control were released this afternoon. It is reported that early yesterday morning, British naval forces went to the various French ships docked in a port in southern England and other places where French soldiers were stationed, and detained the French.

<p>Hitler Allows French Ships to Be Scuttled</p>
<p>Berlin - After learning that some French warships could not escape British control, Führer Hitler has allowed the French government to scuttle these warships to prevent them from falling into enemy hands and increasing future troubles. It is believed here that this approach does not contradict the armistice agreement, as Germany has stated in advance that it has no intention of occupying French warships, but if it wants to prevent these warships from fighting against Germany in the future, then removing the problem at its root is justifiable.

<h3>East African War: Italian Forces' Attack Unsuccessful</h3>
<p>Nairobi - Officials announced that there was no activity by the army on the entire front yesterday.

Enemy reinforcements hiding in a small valley were also strafed. Explosions were heard, and it is believed that the arsenal had been destroyed. It is now known that the Italian forces' first attack on Monday, after firing three hundred and fifty shells at a British outpost, was repelled by British forces, with significant assistance from British planes.

<h3>Germany Refuses to Conclude Alliance Treaty with Romania, Striving to Avoid Conflict with the Soviet Union; Leader of Romanian National Party Organizes New Cabinet</h3>
<p>Bucharest: Romania's desire to immediately obtain German support to deal with its neighbors (especially Hungary and Bulgaria, which are oppressing Romania to return its former territories) has become a pipe dream after the German Minister's hurried trip to Berlin today. According to reliable sources, the German Minister came with orders from the German government, notifying the Romanian side that Germany is currently unable to conclude an alliance treaty with Romania or provide military assistance. The general impression here is that Germany is eager to avoid any actions that could provoke conflict with the Soviet Union. According to a German news agency, the Romanian government resigned today. General Ghiță Racoviță, Minister Without Portfolio of the Tătărescu Cabinet, has been appointed to organize the new cabinet and is currently discussing candidates in the Royal Palace. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>Bucharest: This morning, after Romanian Prime Minister Tătărescu and all cabinet members submitted their resignations, the King entrusted the responsibility of forming a cabinet to Gigurtu, leader of the National Party. The organization of the new cabinet is currently under discussion. Mr. Gigurtu once served as Foreign Minister. (Haitong Telegram, 4th)</p>
<p>Bucharest: Today, Romanian military leaders promulgated 30 articles of regulations to maintain public order and prepare for war. In addition to confirming the curfew regulations stipulated by the Public Security Bureau, prohibiting gatherings, and carrying firearms and weapons, they advised the people to assist the authorities in promoting various air defense measures and regulations, and to assist soldiers in eliminating enemy paratroopers landing from the air. Violators will be severely punished. (Haitong Telegram, 4th)</p>
<p>Bucharest: Soviet officials here speculate that the Balkan countries have recently notified Germany and Italy, informing them that these countries have agreed to consider a plan to cede a small part of Transylvania to Hungary and southern Dobruja to Bulgaria, and to have Greece cede a passage to the Aegean Sea for Bulgaria. (United Press, 4th)</p>
<p>Romanian Prime Minister Submits Resignation to the King</p>
<p>Bucharest: It is generally expected that after Prime Minister Tătărescu delivers an important speech in the Chamber of Deputies, he will submit his resignation to King Carol II and form a new cabinet to adapt to the current pro-German policies. The political circles here are now focused on Germany's attitude, but the German government has not yet made any statement regarding guaranteeing Romania's security. There are rumors that the Soviet Union will make new demands to the Romanian authorities, but this has not been confirmed. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<p>Bucharest: Romanian Prime Minister Tătărescu delivered a speech yesterday to the Foreign Affairs Committees of both the Upper and Lower Houses, stating, "Romania will respectfully fulfill its obligations to the Soviet Union, but we must solemnly declare that Bessarabia and Bukovina, along with their populations, belong to Romania. The judgment of future history will prove our words to be true." Mr. Tătărescu stated that the Romanian government accepted the cession of Bessarabia and northern Bukovina in order to preserve Romania's survival and avoid endangering the future of the Romanian people. As a result of this move, Romania must change its foreign policy and adopt a new direction. (Haitong Telegram, 4th)</p>
<p>Soviet Experts Arrive in Bessarabia</p>
<p>Moscow: Soviet experts have arrived in Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina and have begun work on restoring railways and waterways. The railways from Kischinev to Basarabeasca, Bender, and Ungheni have been restored. At the same time, water traffic on the Dniester River will also be restored soon. (TASS, 3rd)</p>
<p>Moscow: The extent of damage to the railways in Northern Bukovina after the withdrawal of Romanian troops was extremely severe, but Soviet personnel have quickly repaired them. The railway junction at Cernăuți has been repaired, and trains from Lviv to Cernăuți have been running since the 30th of last month. (TASS, 3rd)</p>
<p>Moscow: Officials here announced yesterday that after the Soviet People's Commissar for Defense, Timoshenko, and the Secretary of the Ukrainian Communist Party, Khrushchev, arrived in Budeni, Bessarabia, they proceeded to Kishinev. (Haitong Telegram, 4th)</p>
<p>Romania's Military Preparedness Further Intensified</p>
<p>Bucharest: After the government ordered nationwide military alert last night in order to cope with possible invasions, the situation in Romania became tense again. The government announced that the military commander of the Bucharest region has ordered the capital to take special military precautions. The government radio advised the people to be vigilant against enemy paratroopers, but the government did not specify from which direction the enemy was attacking, because both Bulgaria and Hungary have made territorial demands on Romania. Before the government announced this new military measure, both houses of parliament had adjourned. Before the adjournment, all members stood silently with bowed heads for several minutes of silent prayer. The government did not indicate when parliament would reconvene, but it is widely believed that the government will exercise dictatorial powers during the emergency period in the Balkans. Romanian officials last night refused to confirm reports that an important Romanian representative had flown to meet with Führer Hitler, and that the government had communicated with Prime Minister Mussolini. Signs of political discord within Romania grew last night. Unconfirmed reports said that the government had decided to hold negotiations with Bulgaria and Hungary, based on the agreement between the Soviet Union and Romania, in order to seek a peaceful resolution. As a result, political unrest has increased. The report said that the borders would be determined by negotiations, and the affected residents would mutually relocate. Senior military sources said that the Hungarian troops who opened fire on Romanian soldiers on the Romanian border on Tuesday had retreated back into Hungary, leaving seventy bodies. It is widely believed that the Hungarian troops withdrew because they received orders from their government, as diplomatic efforts to prevent the Balkan war had recently made progress. Furthermore, some military leaders believed that the attacks on Romanian territory were aimed at obtaining information about Romania's defense capabilities. The Hungarian raiding party was ambushed and annihilated by Romanian troops. At noon yesterday, bells tolled throughout Bucharest to mark the shame of Romania's submission to the Soviet Union, and flags were flown at half-mast. The government last night denied reports that Romania had proposed holding a European conference in Rome to resolve various outstanding issues in the Balkans. (United Press, 4th)</p>
<p>Bucharest: The Romanian Ministry of Finance has allocated 10 million lei (Romanian currency) to the Minister of the Interior, specifically for the relief of refugees in Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina.

<h3>German Aircraft Bomb London All Day Long; Reportedly British Aircraft Carrier Hit by Torpedo; Five German Bombers Shot Down</h3>
<p>London: Yesterday, multiple German aircraft continuously bombed London, relentlessly from dawn until dusk. (United Press, 4th)</p>
<p>Hitler's Headquarters: This afternoon, the German military report stated that German submarines fired torpedoes, hitting the British state-of-the-art aircraft carrier "Illustrious." Yesterday, German bombers attacked fortresses, airfields, aircraft factories, and docks along the English Channel and the British North Sea coast. As a result of the German aircraft's attack on a British escort fleet, a large ship was hit by two bombs. Yesterday, British aircraft, using the cover of floating clouds, attacked civilians in western and northern Germany. Eleven women and children and one man were killed, and twenty women and children were seriously injured. A total of six enemy aircraft were destroyed, and four German aircraft were missing. (Haitong Telegram, 4th)</p>
<p>London: The Air Ministry Information Office stated that enemy aircraft continuously attacked England and Scotland yesterday during the day, and British fighters shot down five of their bombers and damaged four others. German aircraft dropped bombs hastily and fled. Most German aircraft flew alone to the English coast. Three Spitfire British aircraft, while patrolling the east coast, saw two Dornier "Do 17" German bombers and attacked one of them, seeing it crash into the sea. The second German aircraft was also severely damaged and fled through the clouds. Subsequently, a third German aircraft was damaged by a British fighter. Furthermore, British aircraft attacked a German aircraft off the coast of Aberdeenshire, and the German aircraft resisted stubbornly before crashing into the sea. The British aircraft pilot saw the German crew launch two rubber boats to escape. A Junkers Ju 88 German bomber was shot down into the sea off the coast of Scotland, and three crew members escaped in a rubber boat. Two Spitfire British aircraft, while patrolling the southeastern coast, shot down another Dornier "Do 17" German aircraft. A Hurricane British fighter damaged a Heinkel He 111 German aircraft over the English Channel and hit its rear gunner. The German aircraft then fled through the clouds. Another squadron of Spitfire British aircraft attacked a Dornier aircraft off the east coast. The aircraft was severely damaged and fled into the clouds. Last night, a Spitfire British aircraft flew out to sea to intercept a German aircraft, and six minutes later, the German aircraft was hit and caught fire before crashing. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>London: The Ministry of Home Security announced that the enemy aircraft that crossed the southern coast of England this morning dropped a small number of bombs, seemingly not aimed at any specific target. It is now known that only two people suffered minor injuries. Yesterday afternoon, enemy aircraft bombed southeastern London, and one house was set on fire by an incendiary bomb. It is not yet known if there were any injuries. One bomb in a garden destroyed the front of a house, and two other bombs fell in the adjacent streets. Other bombs fell in open fields and at sea. One town saw an enemy aircraft fly low and disappear into the sea. Residents saw the enemy aircraft drop bombs. Furthermore, in a village in southeastern England, a group of workers had four bombs drop nearby. One of them was a time-delay bomb. One worker died and three were injured. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<h3>France to Convene National Assembly to Discuss Constitutional Amendments; Government to Request Special Powers from Parliament</h3>
<p>Vichy, France: According to well-informed sources here, the two houses of parliament will submit a resolution to convene a National Assembly, that is, a joint session of the two houses of parliament, for voting during the next session. After this armistice, the current constitution needs to be amended in light of the new situation. This issue concerns the future of the country and must be discussed by a National Assembly. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<p>Vichy: According to semi-official sources, the French government plans to convene parliament to amend the constitution. The government will request necessary powers from parliament to draft a new constitution for France under the authority of Marshal Pétain. The amendments will be made within the framework of republican principles and existing national laws. The new constitution must be approved by parliament or elected representatives replacing the current parliament. Marshal Pétain and his colleagues are now determined to break with convention on how much representation the vocational sector will retain. If France is to recover after its defeat, it must immediately adopt a resolute plan. Parliament must assist the government in improving the entire structure of French administration. The new constitution will guarantee the rights of the family and the homeland. Public opinion will be consistent with parliament in acknowledging that national reconstruction cannot be achieved without the continuous exercise of executive power. Hereafter, merit and intelligence must replace favoritism and bureaucracy, which have harmed the country. The nature of the new constitution will be courageous and novel, restoring national sovereignty and power to the country. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>Geneva: The French cabinet met yesterday. Marshal Pétain, General Weygand, Laval, and Marchand attended to discuss plans for the new French constitution.

<h3>US Senate Naval Affairs Committee Passes New Naval Bill; Stipulates Increase of More Than 200 Ships; Roosevelt to Continue Submitting Military Expansion Proposals</h3>
<p>Washington: The United States Navy Department signed the final contract yesterday, increasing the strength of the United States fleet by 11 percent. However, the Senate Naval Affairs Committee yesterday unanimously passed a new naval bill, increasing the strength of the United States fleet to 70 percent. The Senate Naval Affairs Committee passed the new bill yesterday after only one hour of closed-door review. During the review, Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Stark attended to explain the need to increase the number of warships to 750. The new naval bill stipulates the addition of more than 200 United States warships. The strength of the United States fleet after construction will be greater than the combined fleets of Britain and Japan today. Given current shipbuilding facilities, the shipbuilding process will take five to seven years to complete. After the new warships are built, the United States will have an independent Atlantic fleet. The shipbuilding project will cost US$4 billion. President Roosevelt is preparing to request Congress to allocate US$5 billion early next week to meet the needs of supplementing defense programs. Of this, US$4 billion is to mechanize the United States Army, and the other US$1 billion is to build other warships. The Army Department expects the United States Army's rearmament program to be completed in the early autumn of 1941. The goal of the rearmament program is to accumulate 50,000 first-line fighters and to mechanize defense equipment. General Pershing, commander of the United States Expeditionary Force during World War I, sent a letter to Congress yesterday, urging Congress to enact a law mandating compulsory military training in the United States. Pershing claimed that adopting this plan is "a decisive factor in keeping the United States out of the whirlpool of war." Before the Great War, if the United States had a military training program, it would have prevented the United States from sending untrained soldiers to France to participate in the war. This program could have saved the lives of thousands of American soldiers during the war. (United Press, 4th)</p>

<h3>Large Quantities of American Goods Stagnant in Vietnam</h3>
<p>Hong Kong: More than 6,000 tons of American goods, including airplanes, gasoline, air raid bombs, machinery, transport vehicles, and various accessories, are currently stagnant in Vietnam. In addition, a similar quantity of non-military goods is also prohibited from being transported to Guangdong via Hong Kong due to the emergency situation in Hong Kong. The routes in Vietnam via Haiphong, as well as the routes from Guangdong to Hong Kong, were previously used to export tungsten ore and tung oil to Hong Kong, which were then shipped to the United States to continue paying off U.S. loans to China. Large quantities of kerosene from the United States were transported from Sha Uk Tsuen, 30 miles northeast of Hong Kong, into the interior of Guangdong. However, Hong Kong is now completely isolated from the interior of Guangdong. The Japanese army's goal in blockading Hong Kong is to seriously affect Hong Kong's commerce, because despite the ongoing wars in China and Europe, Hong Kong's exports and imports have been booming, breaking past records. Furthermore, before the Japanese army landed in Shenzhen on June 22, a state-owned Chinese transport company had rushed 4,000 tons of machinery, vehicles, and accessories from the United States to Vietnam. This batch of goods had previously been loaded on a Chinese naval auxiliary ship, which had been staying here for several weeks. But just after it was transported, an accident happened. These 4,000 tons of goods are probably still in Haiphong or Hanoi. However, it is reported that their ownership is still in the hands of Americans, who can reclaim them from the French.

<h3>German Foreign Ministry Announces Sixth White Paper: Secret Political Archives of the French General Staff Reveal Plans to Bomb Soviet Oil Fields</h3>
<p>Berlin. The German Foreign Ministry, on the evening of the 2nd, released Document No. 9 from the secret files of the French General Staff, proving that the Allied Powers were preparing to launch an air raid on the Soviet Caucasus oil region in late June or early July. This document is a communique from General Weygand, Commander-in-Chief of the French forces in the Eastern Mediterranean, dated April 17th of this year, to the commanders-in-chief of the French Air Force and Army, stating that preparations for the bombing of the oil fields have been completed, and the timing of the operation can also be determined. Regarding this operation, there is no need to reach an agreement with Turkey, as such an agreement will certainly be difficult to achieve. The French ambassador to Turkey has already informed the Turkish government in detail that Turkey cannot currently allow aircraft to cross its airspace, nor can it provide airfields for French use, and no other assistance is expected. Supplies will be transported by rail from Aleppo to Nisibin. Weygand mentioned various necessary preparations, including the construction of airfields, the transportation of railway troops and munitions, the arrival of French bombers, the taking of aerial photographs, and the selection of targets. Weygand concluded that the time to begin the operation would be in late June or early July. The communique further stated that the bombing should be completed within a few days, and Turkey should also prepare for hostile acts resulting from the bombing within the specified period. (Haitong Telegraph on the 4th)</p>
<p>Berlin. The German Foreign Ministry yesterday released the sixth White Paper, the content of which pertains to the secret political archives of the French General Staff that German intelligence teams recovered from a train destroyed by artillery fire in the town of Charité along the Loire River. According to official explanations, these archives can also be regarded as evidence of the British and French plans to force Germany to submit. The content is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Cutting off the supply of Swedish iron ore, or destroying its iron ore mines.</p>
<p>(2) Destroying the oil wells in Romania and the Soviet Baku region.</p>
<p>(3) Winning over the Scandinavian countries to fight against Germany, so that the Allied Powers can gain more divisions in terms of military strength.</p>
<p>(4) Urging Romania, Turkey, Greece, and Yugoslavia to declare war on Germany. If the four countries agree, they can mobilize approximately one hundred divisions against Germany.</p>
<p>The first secret file is a telegram from General Weygand to General Gamelin on March 7, 1940, revealing the secret that Britain was then preparing to bomb the Soviet Baku oil fields. The telegram stated briefly, "General Gamelin is aware that Air Marshal Mitchell, commander of the British Middle East Air Force, has received instructions from London to prepare to bomb Baku, and requests that he ask General Kucmak to allow him to inspect the airfields in the areas of Deqabechi Elisson and Kasield, and to allow his planes to land at each airfield. As for his base, he intends to establish it in Deizileh. Therefore, Air Marshal Mitchell has also made a request to me to inspect the French airfield in Deizileh. However, in terms of the political situation in Iraq, there may be disputes regarding this, so I am submitting this request as above. Now I have agreed with Air Marshal Mitchell that when British and French officers go to inspect in the near future, they will all change into plain clothes to avoid attracting attention, ostensibly to investigate the oil development projects there. (Signed) Weygand."</p>
<p>The second secret file is a memorandum written by General Gamelin on March 10, 1940, revealing the secret that Britain and France intended to set up new battle lines in Scandinavia and the Balkans. It stated briefly, "Since January 16, 1940, the French military high command has drafted the entire plan for armed intervention in Finland. The Allied detachment agreed to first land at Petsamo. At the same time, Allied forces occupied the seaports and airfields on the west coast of Norway as a precautionary measure. Thereafter, if possible, military action could be extended to Sweden. The iron ore fields of Gällivare, which are extremely important for the supply of iron ore to Germany, should be occupied immediately. At the same time, a new transportation line should be established between Narvik and Luleå. When conducting semi-official discussions with the British high military authorities, the British side also held the same view. Subsequently, at the British-French military talks on January 31st and February 1st, the British side placed the issue of direct assistance to Finland in the second stage, indicating that action should first be taken against the iron ore fields in northern Sweden. The British-French Supreme Military Council also mostly supported this view. Thus, preparations for an expedition to Scandinavia began. The Allied Joint Force Command prepared to depart on March 1st. As for the Balkans, if war can be launched in the Balkans, it can increase economic pressure on Germany. However, from a military point of view, action in the Balkans can benefit France more than in Scandinavia. However, this issue still depends on Italy's attitude. If so, the scope of the war will inevitably tend to expand. Yugoslavia, Romania, Greece, and Turkey can mobilize one hundred divisions, supplementing the strength of the Allied Powers. Conversely, in Scandinavia, Sweden and Norway can only mobilize ten divisions. However, the outbreak of war in Scandinavia is also beneficial to Britain and France. Regarding the plan for Scandinavia, we should make every effort to rescue Finland, and at the very least, we must control Sweden's iron ore fields and Norwegian seaports. But from a strategic point of view, the Balkans and the Caucasus are more important and beneficial, as they can cut off Germany's oil supply. But the key to the Balkans is still in the hands of Italy. (Signed) Gamelin."</p>
<p>The third secret file is a telegram from General Gamelin to General Weygand on March 12, 1940, stating briefly, "I believe that the British army should be responsible for the war in the Middle East, and the Turkish army should be responsible for military affairs in the Caucasus. The commander-in-chief can discuss this issue with General Kiocmak, the Turkish Chief of Staff. As for the strategy for the Caucasus, a summary will be sent by special envoy."</p>
<p>The fourth secret file is a secret telegram sent by the French ambassador to Turkey, Marché-Grillou, on March 14, 1940, stating briefly, "Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoğlu told me that he had received a telegram from the Turkish ambassador to the Soviet Union, mentioning the Soviet's terrifying bombing of Baku. I immediately replied that new-style bombers could fly from Deizileh or northern Iraq to Baku, but they would fly over the airspace of Turkey and Iran. The Turkish Foreign Minister then said, 'Does your country want to lodge a protest with Iran?' However, he did not explicitly state whether it would cause difficulties for Turkey. If I were to ask him this question, it would seem awkward, so I did not continue to discuss this issue. But this is an extremely important matter, so I am telegraphing General Gamelin and relaying this situation to the British ambassador to Turkey. (Signed) Marché-Grillou."</p>
<p>The fifth secret file is General Gamelin's final recommendation to the commander-in-chief, advocating forcing Germany to abandon its "current wait-and-see attitude," imposing a blockade on neutral countries, and using "retaliatory" measures against violators. If Norway and Sweden violate the blockade and provide supplies to Germany, their foreign trade routes will be cut off. At the same time, it further advocated cutting off the supply of Soviet oil to Germany, but this raised the issue of war against the Soviet Union, and the cooperation of Turkey was taken as a countermeasure. If so, bombing the Baku oil fields could completely cut off Germany's fuel supply. At the same time, it was hoped that air bases could be obtained in Turkey. To help realize this plan, the navy should blockade traffic in the Black Sea. At the same time, in order to hinder Germany's inland waterway transport, bombs should be dropped on various rivers by aircraft. Although the Soviet-Finnish armistice was disappointing, the important goal we set for 1940 remains unchanged. We should win over the neutral countries. At this juncture, we should simultaneously devote ourselves to military and diplomatic activities. (Signed) Gamelin." (Haitong Telegraph on the 4th)</p>
<h3>British Parliament Discusses Freedom of Speech: A Member Requests Guarantees, Churchill Indicates Scope</h3>
<p>London. A member recently asked the Prime Minister to guarantee the complete freedom that newspapers previously enjoyed, so that they can express their free and unconstrained opinions on all aspects of the war, or comment on any attempt to initiate peace discussions. Party Minister Attlee replied on behalf of the Prime Minister, stating that the government's policy is to not interfere with the freedom of newspapers to express opinions or comment on issues of war and peace as far as possible. However, it must be recognized that if speech that provides intelligence to the enemy or seeks to undermine war efforts is used under the guise of expressing opinions, then the government is not prepared to provide a guarantee of non-interference (cheers from the crowd).

<h3>Details of British Mail Ship Sinking: Over a Thousand Germans and Italians on Board, Majority Rescued After Being Hit by a Torpedo</h3>
<p>London. The British mail ship "Arandura Star" (15,501 tons), recently sunk by a German submarine off the west coast of Scotland, carried approximately 2,000 people. Survivors recounted the terrible scenes on board before the ship sank. The ship was hit by a torpedo at around 6 a.m. The enemies detained on the ship, especially the Italians, rushed to clear a path, pushing others aside, to seize lifeboats and escape. After being hit by the torpedo, the ship began to sink very quickly. At that time, everyone on board had life jackets, and lifeboats and rafts were quickly lowered. The victims swam or rested on rafts. Two hours later, they saw an airplane and knew that help would soon arrive. Fortunately, the sea was calm, but debris and corpses were seen floating with the waves all around. (Reuters Telegraph on the 4th)</p>
<p>London. The British mail ship "Arandura Star," carrying 1,500 detained Germans and Italians to Canada, was sunk by a German submarine with a torpedo. Approximately 1,000 survivors were landed yesterday at a port in Scotland by a British ship. The "Arandura Star" had British soldiers escorting the ship. After being hit by the torpedo, they sank along with many Germans and Italians. When the torpedo hit, people were panicked and rushed to clear a path, which greatly hindered the lowering of lifeboats. Two soldiers said, "The ship was hit without warning. Although we hate the German submarines, it is not as much as the Germans and Italians on board, because those people fiercely criticized this kind of warfare, almost like crazy people. At that time, the order was chaotic, so it was quite difficult to jump into the lifeboats." The captain and several senior crew members were standing on the bridge and on the deck. Some of them may have sunk with the ship. Some British soldiers severely criticized the behavior of the German prisoners, saying that they were rude and cruel, trying to push the Italians aside, so the British soldiers had to stop them. Germans and Italians in the mail ship's lifeboats clearly showed hostility, and the British army continued to guard to prevent them from fighting each other. It is not yet possible to estimate the number of casualties, but it seems that most of the Italians who were British merchants suffered the heaviest casualties. There were also casualties among the crew and the British army. When a lifeboat capsized, a German prisoner on the boat immediately asked everyone in the water to help turn the boat upright, and then rescued the people in the water to get on board. According to the shipping company, most of the crew members have been rescued. The total number of deaths has not yet been determined. In addition to those who are already in a port in Scotland, it is hoped that more people have escaped and landed. (Reuters Telegraph on the 4th)</p>

<h3>High Cost of Living in Hong Kong: Many Overseas Students Return to the Mainland for Education, Semester Exams Completed Within a Week, Several Schools Preparing to Relocate Back to the Mainland</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong Correspondence) The summer vacation is approaching, and schools are holding semester exams and preparing to open tutoring classes. Because the cost of living in Hong Kong is rising, making it difficult to maintain, many graduates and students are planning to transfer to schools in the mainland. There are also schools planning to relocate back to the mainland. The details are recorded separately below.</p>
<p>Transfer to the Mainland</p>
<p>The cost of living in Hong Kong is increasing day by day, and school expenses are especially high, making it difficult for middle and lower-class families to sustain. There are many students who have dropped out mid-semester, with each school having several to more than ten students. With the end of the current semester, most of the high school graduates who are able to continue their education are preparing to apply to universities in the mainland. In addition to those preparing to participate in the unified admissions in Hong Kong, the rest are gradually returning to the mainland to apply. According to news from the visa office, more than one hundred students have returned to the country via Vietnam in the past ten days. Many high school students who have not graduated are also planning to transfer to other schools. In the past week, school authorities have received many requests from students for transfer certificates. Most of the schools requested for transfer are provincial and county high schools in southern Guangdong and northern Guangdong. There are also those going to high schools in Guangxi, Yunnan, and other places. According to a student, some commercialized schools are now putting many obstacles in the way of students requesting transfers.</p>
<p>Schools Relocating</p>
<p>In order to develop Guangdong culture, the Guangdong Provincial authorities have ordered all universities to relocate to the province. South China Agricultural College has already relocated. It is recently heard that the Guangdong Provincial authorities have sent another letter to Lingnan, National, and Guangzhou Universities in Hong Kong, considering relocating back to Guangdong to promote Guangdong culture. The relocation expenses will also be borne by the provincial government to some extent. As for the South China University established in Hong Kong, a new main campus has been built at Jiaoxikou in the north of Meixian city. The school environment is quite good. It is expected that many students from the Hong Kong campus of South China will transfer to the main campus. The Provincial Temporary High School, since the fall of Wan Chai, relocated to Tak Ming Secondary School in Hong Kong to teach. It has now been decided to relocate to Enping during the summer vacation. More than two hundred students at the school will also relocate with the school. It is also learned that three schools, formerly a certain high school from Guangzhou that took the Kowloon-Mong Kok route, are currently preparing to relocate back to the mainland due to certain issues.</p>

<h3>Finance: Negative Rumors Fill the Market, Gold Becomes a One-Sided Affair</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spot gold market plummeted by more than 200 yuan, as rumors spread that Hong Kong gold prices had fallen below the 5,000 yuan mark. Furthermore, due to the obstruction of gold transportation in Hong Kong, those who had purchased gold in Shanghai for transport to Hong Kong were forced to sell it. It was also reported that 1,000 taels of gold had arrived in Tianjin and were being sold in the market, increasing the selling pressure in the market. Generally, those holding gold saw the unfavorable situation and decided to sell it off. The opening price was stable at 5,300 yuan, and it even rose by 30 yuan as money changers absorbed some of it. However, this soon led to a large-scale selling spree. Silver firms and gold firms sold off in large quantities, and securities firms and jewelry stores also dumped their holdings. Although some money changers continued to buy, the disparity between buyers and sellers was too great, and the buying became weaker. The price bottomed out at 5,050 yuan, threatening to plunge into the 5,000 yuan mark. Fortunately, the price recovered at the close of the morning session, closing at 5,080 yuan. The market was still weak at the beginning of the afternoon session, opening at 5,095 yuan and soon dropping by more than 10 yuan. However, gold firms and securities firms suddenly showed buying interest and started to buy in, pushing the price up to 5,180 yuan. However, the money changers who had bought in during the day took the opportunity to close out their positions, so the evening session only reached 5,130 yuan, down 215 yuan from the previous day. The total trading volume for the day was about 4,000 taels. Gold jewelry at jewelry stores was discounted by 20 yuan, while customs gold remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Spot Gold Nears the 5,000 Yuan Mark</p>
<p>The price of spot gold opened at 45 yuan lower per bar (10 taels) due to weak market sentiment. Silver firms sold gold to money changers at 5,300 yuan per 10 taels. Later, thanks to the buying by a money changer and a securities firm, the price rose by 30 yuan. Silver firms sold a total of 30 taels of gold to money changers at 5,330 yuan. Then, as foreign exchange rates weakened, securities firms and silver firms competed to dump their holdings, causing the price to fall by 70 yuan. Money changers sold a total of several dozen taels to silver firms at 5,260 yuan. After that, the selling subsided slightly, and money changers bought in slightly, causing the price to rise by 30 yuan again. Gold firms traded 30 taels among themselves at 5,290 yuan. Considering the increasingly weak foreign exchange rates and various negative news spreading in the market, another wave of selling was triggered. Securities firms and silver firms rushed to dump their holdings, and gold firms followed suit. Although some buyers saw the low prices and continued to buy in, the short positions were extremely large, and the price soon plummeted by 240 yuan. Gold firms sold 10 taels to silver firms at 5,050 yuan. At noon, silver firms and money changers' appetite for buying improved, and the price rose. Securities firms sold 20 taels to gold firms at 5,080 yuan at the midday close. In the afternoon, market conditions remained poor. Silver firms sold 10 taels to money changers at 5,095 yuan. Later, due to retail sales, the price fell by another 15 yuan. Silver firms traded 10 taels among themselves at 5,080 yuan. Then, a gold firm suddenly started to buy in, and the exchange rate also weakened sharply. Securities firms followed suit, pushing the price up by 100 yuan. Gold firms sold several dozen taels to their counterparts at 5,180 yuan. Before the evening close, the price retreated to 5,130 yuan as foreign exchange rates remained weak and high prices were difficult to sustain. Silver firms sold 20 taels to gold firms, closing at 5,130 yuan for the evening. As a result, the price fell by 215 yuan compared to the previous day. The market was even weaker after the close, with sellers willing to sell at 5,115 yuan, but no transactions were made. The price fluctuated by 280 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of spot gold at gold firms was also several dozen yuan higher than spot gold, while the buying price was 30 yuan lower. The margin gold was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there were few transactions.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Drops Three Times in a Row</p>
<p>The selling price of jewelry gold at jewelry stores was initially 550 yuan per tael at Datong Bank. At 10:00 AM, it was discounted by 10 yuan. At 11:00 AM, it was discounted by another 10 yuan. At noon, it was discounted by another 10 yuan. At 2:00 PM in the afternoon, it rose by 10 yuan. As a result, the price was 20 yuan lower than the previous day. Datong Bank lowered the price to 530 yuan, while Xin Datong Bank had the same price. The buying price was about 30 yuan lower.</p>
<p>Discount Rate at 45 Yuan, Interest Rates Also Lower</p>
<p>Yesterday, the discount rate for foreign exchange bills fell sharply. The discount rate was as low as 45 yuan per thousand yuan, and the selling rate was only 50 yuan. There were no changes in the afternoon. The price fell by another 10 yuan compared to the previous day. The interest rate set by the Money Dealers Association fell by another 0.1 fen, totaling 0.21 fen. It is rumored that it may fall below 0.2 fen.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange: Selling Becomes More Eager</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no changes in HSBC's listed prices. The dark market for British and American currency was still selling more than buying, and the trend was weakening. The rumor that the new Sino-American loan negotiation had been established was becoming more prevalent, and the atmosphere of peace in Europe was becoming stronger. It was also rumored that Hong Kong gold prices had fallen below the 5,000 yuan mark, and that the import of gold into Hong Kong was obstructed. Spot gold also fell sharply, affecting the foreign exchange market. The opening price for US dollars reached 6.28125 yuan. In the afternoon, Chinese merchants bought in to profit, and the price recovered slightly. However, the selling trend re-emerged, so the closing price was at the weakest level. The closing price for first pound sterling was 3.9375 yuan, US dollar was 6.28125 yuan, long British pound was 0.0625 yuan, and long American pound was 1.5625 yuan. The trading volume was extremely high throughout the day. Yesterday was the US Independence Day, and there were no telegrams for US exchange rates today.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Initially Absorbs US Dollars</p>
<p>The London telegraph initially showed a near fall of 0.0625 for long British pounds and a flat price for forward contracts. The price for US silver was unchanged, and the prices for London raw gold, exchange rates for British pounds against US dollars and Shanghai currency, etc., were also flat. There was no telegram for the exchange rate against French francs. The exchange rate for US dollars against British pounds was up 0.02, and the exchange rate against Shanghai currency was up 0.1 yuan. There was no market for French francs. The central bank's listed prices remained the same. The bank's opening selling price for spot was 3.875 pounds sterling and 6.125 yuan US dollars, which were both flat compared to the previous close. The opening prices for futures were also unchanged. After the opening, British banks were all intending to sell. Although the Hong Kong telegram and a certain client absorbed about 100,000 US dollars, short positions were quite plentiful, and the market was firm. HSBC's listed prices remained unchanged. The silver balancing tax was reduced by 0.25%. At that time, the Hong Kong telegram entered British banks, favoring Macalister and American banks' July US dollar exchange rate of 6.15625 and 125. Subsequently, a speculator came to buy in spot US dollars, priced at 6.1875 yuan at American banks. However, Chinese banks dumped their holdings, and the potential trend gradually weakened. Chinese banks sold July US dollars to foreign banks such as HSBC and Macalister from 6.1875 to 25. By the close, the price became longer, the first pound sterling was 3.9375 yuan, and the US dollar was 6.28125 yuan. The July British gold was 3.90625 pounds sterling, and the US dollar was 6.25 yuan. Compared with the morning opening, the spot British pound was up 0.0625, the US dollar was down 1.5625, and the futures were also longer.</p>
<p>Chinese Merchants Buy In to Profit</p>
<p>At the beginning of the afternoon, Chinese merchant speculators bought in to profit, once buying July US dollars at 6.25 to 21875. The market showed a slight softening. Later, they returned the profits to foreign banks, favoring the same month US dollar at 6.25 and 6.28125 at British banks and Zhejiang banks. Therefore, the evening closing price was exactly the same as the midday closing price. The British gold was 3.9375 pounds sterling, the US dollar was 6.28125 yuan, the July British gold was 3.90625 pounds sterling, and the US dollar was 6.25 yuan. Compared with the previous day's close, the spot British pound was up 0.0625, the US dollar was down 1.5625, the July British pound was down 0.0625, and the US dollar was down 1.875.</p>

<p>Tianjin: British Gold Strengthens</p>
<p>Tianjin, 4th (Thursday) - The foreign exchange market opened flat this morning. The spot British exchange rate loosened by 0.0625 to 3 pence and 5625. The spot US exchange rate remained unchanged at 5.625 yuan. The Shanghai exchange rate rose by 1 yuan to 110 yuan. The black market for "Joint Notes" increased by 1.4 yuan to 96 yuan.</p>
<h3>US Dollar Notes: Drop Below the 16 Yuan Mark</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw British and American gold pounds plummet in line with spot gold by 5 yuan. The British and American gold notes frequently loosened in the black market foreign exchange. Supplies from all parties were quite smooth. The former fell by 0.5 yuan, and the latter even fell below the 16 yuan mark. Hong Kong notes fell by 0.05 yuan following the drop in Hong Kong and Shanghai exchange rates. Canadian notes and Philippine notes were not lacking in supply, and the market prices were consistently weak. The supply of Japanese gold notes was drastically reduced, and the market price gradually stabilized, reaching 1.135 yuan in the evening session. The supply and demand of Korean notes were balanced, and the price remained at 0.97 yuan in the evening session.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains: Japanese Merchants Buy Broad Beans</h3>
<p>Recently, the broad bean market has been affected by two factors: first, with the price of rice being expensive, people in the countryside intend to store broad beans as a staple food, resulting in a lack of supply; and second, although traders lack ship space for transportation, Japanese merchants still come to the market to purchase and ship broad beans to South China and North China. Therefore, with the limited supply and high demand, the price has been gradually rising. Yesterday, merchants from the main street and Xinghua purchased more than 600 bags of Jiading white broad beans at a price of 22.5 yuan, 200 bags of Wuhu small white broad beans at a price of 20 yuan, and more than 250 bags of Beigang green broad beans at a price of 23 yuan to 21.5 yuan.</p>
<p>In addition, 385 bags of beans were shipped to Hong Kong today.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Foreign Sugar Continues to Weaken</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market continued to weaken. The association's clearing price for spot No. 24 coarse white sugar was 69 yuan for the bonded warehouse and 68 yuan for the non-bonded warehouse. The price in the afternoon was 68.3 yuan to 68.1 yuan, down 0.7 yuan to 0.9 yuan. The re-export price was 54 yuan and 0.5 yuan, and the delivery price on July 10 was 54.7 yuan to 54.5 yuan, down 0.7 yuan. The price for Taiyuan car white B-mark sugar was 79 yuan for the Western warehouse and 78.5 yuan for the Eastern warehouse. Dutch red sugar was 57.5 yuan to 57.3 yuan, native snow white sugar was 69 yuan, No. 1 rock sugar was 91 yuan, and Jingming rock sugar was 92.5 yuan, all down 0.5 yuan. The national sugar opened at 51 yuan for more than 160 bags of Hainan red sugar.</p>
<h3>Securities: Domestic Sentiment Suddenly Excited</h3>
<p>The securities dark market suddenly changed yesterday, with prices rising across the board. Class A stocks approached 62 yuan, Class B stocks exceeded 2 yuan to 2.5 yuan again, and even Class D stocks, which had been sluggish, exceeded 9 yuan. The market situation can be considered good. Initially, there were rumors of peace between Germany and Britain, which may lead to a resolution of the Sino-Japanese conflict. In the afternoon, there were rumors that the loan application to the United States had a hope of success, and market sentiment became firmer. Furthermore, the sharp decline in gold prices had a very good impact. Short sellers rushed to cover their positions, and the market situation rose gradually from beginning to end. However, large investors among buyers and sellers were still not enthusiastic. There were not many transactions in the morning. Lianhe bought in slightly, and Shuntai sold out. Demand suddenly increased in the afternoon. Lianhe continued to buy in, and Shunheng, Gongmao, Dafeng, Hu Heji, and sporadic retail investors covered their positions or went long. Jiufeng turned to selling, and Jiukang sold out more. Lianyi, Xieda, and Yichang all sold out, but the prices still rose steadily. However, it is hoped that the news can be confirmed, otherwise it will still be difficult to stabilize. The result of the price increases was a uniform increase of 0.4 yuan to 0.6 yuan. The total turnover was approximately 900,000 yuan. A brief summary table is listed below:</p>
<p>Category Highest Lowest Closing Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>Unified A 61.80 61.40 61.70 Up 0.45</p>
<p>Unified B 52.55 52.05 12.50 Up 0.60</p>
<p>Unified C 50.75 50.30 50.75 Up 0.40</p>
<p>Unified D 49.20 49.00 49.20 Up 0.40</p>
<p>Unified E 50.40 50.05 50.40 Up 0.40</p>
<p>In stock trading, 100 shares of Great China Match Company were traded at a price of 21.5 yuan.</p>
<p>The stock market at the Public Concourse yesterday opened quietly and gradually trended upward. The turnover was acceptable. Jardine Matheson shares once reached 31 yuan, and British-American Tobacco shares also reached 24.5 yuan. The high prices attracted a lot of profit-taking, but the market's absorption capacity was also not weak. The rubber shares also attracted more attention.</p>
<p>London, 3rd (Wednesday) - The listed prices of stocks of various British companies in the London Far East market showed a uniform recovery in bank stocks. Macalister Bank rose by 7 shillings and 6 pence to 5 pounds, 17 shillings and 6 pence. Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's UK registered shares rose by 4 pounds to 63 pounds. However, Gongping Coal Mine unregistered shares continued to fall by 6 pence to 15 shillings and 6 pence. The rest remained unchanged.</p>
<p>London, 3rd (Wednesday) - The listed prices of Chinese foreign debts remained stable today. There were no changes in the upper and lower tier bonds.</p>
<h3>Beifa Distributes Final Dividend</h3>
<p>Beifa Co., Ltd. in this city will hold its 55th annual shareholders' meeting on July 10 and will distribute the final dividend for the year ending February 1940, at 1 yuan per share, together with the interim dividend of 0.5 yuan per share, for a total of 1.5 yuan per share for the year. The company's profits for this year reached 450,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Food: Rice Prices Rise Immediately After Falling</h3>
<p>The rice market yesterday morning saw both buyers and sellers decline following the trend of the previous day. The sellers were afraid of another direct plunge, due to the arrival of 60,000 to 70,000 bags of foreign rice and the expected arrival of 200,000 to 300,000 bags of Siamese rice within ten days. Market sentiment softened, and the selling pressure suddenly increased, causing prices to plunge by 1 yuan to 1.5 yuan, and nearly 2 yuan in some cases. Small-grain rice was sold at only 61 yuan, and second-grade Tokyo pointed rice had retreated below the 60 yuan mark, ranging from 59.5 yuan to 59 yuan. However, small-grain merchants no longer sold, and the floating supply dried up. Inland merchants and rural households took advantage of the low prices to purchase lower-grade goods, and the market became active. Low-priced goods were the first to rebound, exceeding the 60 yuan mark again. Subsequently, local stores also joined the buying spree, and the market recovered to its original level by closing, similar to the previous market. No. 1 old Saigon rice remained at 65.5 yuan, No. 2 at 63.5 yuan, No. 1 Siamese rice at 65 yuan, and new Annam short-grain rice at 65.2 yuan. Small-grain rice was 62.7 yuan to 62.5 yuan. However, the market fluctuated by as much as 2 yuan. The total spot trading volume was more than 6,000 bags, and the futures trading volume was 200 tons.</p>
<p>The glutinous rice market continued to be firm. According to industry insiders, the reason is that inland stocks are depleted, the supply is not continuous, and the Shanghai warehouses have thin inventories. At the same time, the price of glutinous rice is relatively low compared to other goods, making it popular among the general public. The storefront sales are booming, and the demand from food vendors is particularly strong. Scarcity makes the product valuable, and the selling price continues to rise by about 1.5 yuan. Jinyang white glutinous rice is 65 yuan, Changdan white glutinous rice is 63-64 yuan, and Jiangbei glutinous rice is out of stock and there is no market.</p>
<p>More than 1,000 bags of thick and thin short-grain domestic rice continued to arrive. It is rumored that the off-market trading was scarce for two reasons: first, the sharp decline in foreign rice prices in the early market made market sentiment nervous, and sellers sought to unload; and second, the high selling prices made it difficult to sell to customers. The asking prices continued to depreciate by 1 yuan. Changbang special clear short-grain rice was 73.5 yuan to 73 yuan, Su Kun Changzhou short-grain rice was 71-72 yuan, old rice was 69 yuan, Qingsi special thin rice was 73 yuan, and general rice was 72 yuan to 70 yuan. Nangang early rice was 69 yuan.</p>
<h3>Inland Flour Floods the Market, Wheat Supply to Be Opened</h3>
<p>Wheat Flour: Yesterday, the market continued to stand firm. The No. 2 flour mill's asking price was still 15.2 yuan, limited only to supply for actual sales on the main street. Guest merchants and hoarders were all restricted, creating the sale of inland miscellaneous brands such as Double Lion, Jinshan, Johnson, and Phoenix brands flooding the market. Yesterday, spot Green Phoenix and Double Lion brands were all sold for 16 yuan. It is rumored that there were also futures sales, with July and August Phoenix flour at 16.4 yuan, and Jinshan and Johnson flour at 16.1 yuan, which is 2-3 yuan lower than the peak price. Only about 10,000 bags were approved for sale by Chinese factories.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday, the new wheat supply gradually arrived in small quantities, but the formal market has not yet opened. Most of the wheat was for delivery of previously sold goods. It is rumored that Japanese factories bought nearly 10,000 bags at a price of 25 yuan to 24.5-6 yuan. Chinese factories had only a small amount to buy. It is rumored that the handling of transportation permits has made considerable progress, and it is feared that the wheat market will soon surge.</p>
<h3>Yarn: July Futures Yarn Rumored to Have Been Traded, Cancellation of Margin and Change to Difference Payment</h3>
<p>The yarn market is calm, and the overall situation is in a state of fluctuation. At the same time, in actual transactions, the Hong Kong and Yunnan gangs have been actively purchasing coarse yarn, so market sentiment is relatively stable. According to the market, July futures yarn has been traded slightly at a price of 910 yuan to 895 yuan. Neither side collects margin. When the market price changes by 100 yuan, the difference of 100 yuan is paid. This approach is equivalent to a disguised exchange. In this regard, the market will not have major ups and downs, of course, there will be no problems. If the amount of chips increases, the fluctuations will be great, and future disputes will be even more difficult to resolve.</p>
<p>The opening price for spot yarn in the morning was 890 yuan for 20-count Double Horse yarn due to various unfavorable factors and conditions for the bulls, falling to 880 yuan. Later, it was heard that the Guangdong gang still had demand, and market sentiment was revitalized, rising again to 897 yuan. Unexpectedly, the weakening of foreign exchange and the decline in gold prices caused the market to soften again, falling back again. The closing price was 887 yuan. According to the half-day transaction statistics, 1,899 bales were traded. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn was not much different from the previous day. Today, 35 pieces of yarn were shipped to Xiamen, 30 pieces to Hong Kong, and 95 pieces to Yantai. The amount purchased by each gang is listed below:</p>
<p>Same Industry 1,200 Hong Kong 325</p>
<p>Inland 4 Ningbo 200</p>
<p>Yunnan 170 Total 1,899</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Stagnation Amidst Hesitant Industry Observers</h3>
<p>Spot cotton trading remains as dull as ever, with few buyers from factories. Industry peers are also hesitant to move forward, with only Japanese factories making some purchases. However, payment for these purchases is delayed by one to two months. American upland cotton (彭家浦) is priced at $202. Japanese factories purchased 200 bales with payment due in two months.</p>
<p>Regarding overseas cotton market prices, the New York cotton market initially showed firmness due to reports of unfavorable weather in cotton-growing regions. Later, purchases from New Orleans and Liverpool pushed closing prices higher, up 7 to 16 points compared to the previous day. There was no trading in the Indian market yesterday, but a rise of one and a half rupees is predicted.</p>
<p>Transactions in Shanghai's foreign cotton market are extremely quiet. All parties are adopting a wait-and-see attitude due to the complex situation. Fellow traders are holding firm to their positions, citing difficulties in transporting Indian cotton.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth's Decline Proves Difficult to Reverse</h3>
<p>Domestic Cloth: Yesterday, Zhejiang merchants suddenly became active, with a slight increase in demand for dyed grey cloth. However, due to the abundant inventory in the market, it's difficult to reverse the downward trend. White goods like fine cloth, fine twill, and coarse cloth continue to fall by about 2.5 dimes per piece. Bleached and dyed cloth fell by about 5 dimes. Merchants from the Zhejiang route, Wenzhou, Ningbo, and Taizhou, sold over 500 pieces of coarse cloth, fine cloth, twill, colored cloth, and printed cloth, reportedly due to the fact that most goods originally imported from Guangdong and Yunnan are now entering through Zhejiang ports. Dyers on this street sold over 100 pieces of lower-grade twill. Wholesale dealers sold one hundred and several dozen pieces of coarse cloth and bleached and dyed cloth. Fujian merchants sold corduroy (線叫嗶嘰) at 82.5 cents, but sales remain slow. However, trading on this street is slightly more active, and sellers are becoming scarce. By the afternoon closing, there was a slight upward trend. Dragon Head brand sold at $28.40, and corduroy at 83.5 cents.</p>
<h3>Dried Fruits and Nuts: Candied Tangerines Rise by Three Dollars</h3>
<p>Twenty cases of newly arrived Xiamen candied tangerines were released yesterday. The price is up by three dollars compared to previous trading. Market prices are also being quoted higher, and further tightening of supply is anticipated.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Export of Chinese Tea Restricted Due to Production Limits</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the European war, the foreign trade of Chinese tea has suffered a significant blow. More recently, Italy's entry into the war has disrupted Mediterranean shipping, causing trade routes to stagnate. To adapt to the environment and adjust supply and demand, the Chinese authorities, through the Trade Commission, convened a meeting in Chongqing to implement production limits on exported black and green tea. Production will be reduced by 20% compared to the previous year, based on the traditional tea production proportions of each province. According to general estimates, the quota for Anhui and Jiangxi regions this year is 340,000 boxes, Zhejiang and Fujian 280,000 boxes, and Hunan and Hubei 180,000 boxes. It is expected that the total export volume of Chinese tea this year, under the central control, will still reach 800,000 boxes. Today, 205 pieces of tea were shipped to Xiamen.</p>
<h3>Medicinal Materials: Honeysuckle Trading Scarce, Low as $175</h3>
<p>Since the start of summer, new honeysuckle has been abundantly available and sold in a timely manner, making the market quite active. Previously, the market price reached a high of $220, then fell to $200. Currently, various merchant groups have gradually stocked up sufficiently, leading to sluggish sales. Inventory is also ample, and transactions are only sporadic. For example, new goods from Shangzhuang are selling for $180 to $175, while existing inventory attracts little interest.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Crude Oil Sees Some Back and Forth</h3>
<p>Yesterday, 3,500 cans and another 100 pieces of crude oil were transported from Tianjin. Today, there was an export of 994 cans of crude oil to Hong Kong, and another 145 cans to Xiamen.</p>
<h3>Metals: Huisheng Iron Remains Steady</h3>
<p>Due to the obstruction of sales channels for Huisheng Iron by merchants from Southeast Asia (Nanyang幫), coupled with the sluggish purchases of merchants from Northern China, such as those from Tianjin, Yantai, and Qingdao, the market is quite bleak and sentiment is very depressed. Although factories in this area producing toys, printed iron, cans, cigarettes, and biscuits occasionally search for supplies, actual transactions are limited. Due to high costs and scarce arrivals, prices remain firm. Old steel is around $200, and new steel around $180.</p>

<h3>Couple Knowledge: Hygiene Tips for Loving Couples</h3>

<p>(Hours) 10 AM to 6 PM, Closed Sundays</p>
<p>Couples should indeed be loving, but in their love, they often neglect hygiene.</p>
<p>If sexual weakness is discovered to hinder love, seek effective treatment promptly.</p>
<p>In the arena of courtship, a man pursues a young woman, painstakingly employing all means to progress from unfamiliarity to acquaintance, from acquaintance to friendship, and then further to love. He may become so infatuated that he neglects eating and sleeping. Once mutual understanding leads to marriage, both parties harbor burning desires in their hearts. Therefore, after the wedding ceremony, once the guests have departed, they are sure to complete the scene of "brocade curtains stir without wind, silver hooks move, delicate moans fill the air, and dreams are fragrant." This scene marks the beginning of their shared new world. Many men, after a blissful marriage, enjoy smooth sailing, with decades passing like a single day. When their children grow up, all are intelligent and capable, and their careers are successful, with everything going as desired, their relatives and friends wish them prosperity, longevity, and many sons. At this point, they suddenly realize the effectiveness of marital love and mutual support, and they smile broadly, feeling indescribable joy in their hearts! The birthday celebrations of Guo Ziyi in history and the centennial celebration of Mr. Ma Xiangbo in the past are both well-known.</p>
<p>However, the affairs of the world are often full of contradictions. Loving couples often neglect the essential principles of hygiene, leading to widespread debauchery. Furthermore, some men, due to youthful self-pollution, excessive indulgence, or infection, suffer weakened innate functions. Once married, they often experience nocturnal emissions (遺精), spermatorrhea (滑精), and dissipated energy, leading to infertility and neurasthenia. Although the desire is there, the strength is lacking, and the couple's sexual life cannot be fulfilled. In such cases, a young wife, forced to watch her youth pass by idly, cannot help but feel resentment. As a result, the couple may become estranged, constantly quarrel, and even engage in adultery or elopement, leading to divorce proceedings, which are not uncommon! As for the men themselves, they often suffer from extreme nervous weakness, resulting in headaches, brain pain, forgetfulness, insomnia, mental confusion, inability to think, and a ringing sound in their ears with the slightest movement, even leading to fainting and unconsciousness. How many such men can avoid premature aging or early death? The crisis is indeed severe!</p>
<p>Today, with the advancement of medical science, effective treatments are available for the aforementioned conditions. Taking gonadal hormone preparations like "Sheng Zhi Su (生殖素)," can replenish sperm, strengthen the kidneys, invigorate the brain, activate the blood, and nourish the nerves overnight, alleviating the condition. Continued use will completely cure the aforementioned conditions in a short period of time, and can also improve overall health, achieving the effect of rejuvenation. However, those with nocturnal emissions must also take "Ximituo Shi (希米脫氏) Sperm-Consolidating Tablets" to strengthen the sperm gate and prevent leakage, resulting in even faster results. However, patients who can personally come to our clinic in Shanghai for electrotherapy, injections, surgery, and other targeted treatments are guaranteed a cure.</p>
<h3>Beauty: Breasts are the Source of Happiness for Women</h3>
<p>— Dr. Yao Chongpei, American Medical Doctor</p>
<p>Regardless of the occasion, beautiful and healthy women always have an advantage. Men are always attracted to them, and society respects them. So, how can women enhance their beauty and health? Medically speaking, the key is to maintain healthy ovarian function. When a woman's ovaries are healthy, the characteristic features of her body develop well. The most obvious is the firm, elastic peak of the breasts. Even when wearing clothes, the shape can be seen, with two peaks standing side by side, creating a deep valley in between. How intoxicating is that! At the same time, the buttocks must also be relatively developed, adding to the supple waist to form the woman's most mysterious and complete curves. Women with such well-developed bodies also have a strong metabolism, producing a large number of new cells in the skin, muscles, blood, and endocrine system. As a result, the skin naturally becomes white, tender, and moist, the muscles become plump and full, and the blood is rich and red. The rosy complexion shines through the moist skin, creating an apple-like beauty. Therefore, such women possess completely natural beauty and health, unattainable by others through cosmetics alone. Not only are they incomparably happy and beautiful during their virginity, like peach blossoms smiling in the spring breeze, but if they are chosen by a lover and married, the love between the couple will deepen, and they will have children early, forming a sweet family. At this time, they are not only a glorious housewife but also a happy mother. However, there are few such women in the world, because most women suffer from irregular menstruation, leukorrhea, lack of sensation, and other ailments, which damage ovarian function, causing it to weaken. Metabolism is also reduced, resulting in flat breasts, a haggard complexion, and an unattractive appearance. They are unable to bear children and lack the qualifications to be mothers. The tragedy of their fate is imaginable. The only remedy is to take the ovarian preparation "Sheng Zhi Su (生殖素)" to nourish the ovaries and nerves. Continued use will completely cure the aforementioned diseases in a short period of time and can also make the breasts stand up, enhancing beauty and health.</p>
<h3>What Bad Consequences Can Nocturnal Emission Lead To?</h3>
<p>— Zhan Nianceng, Venereal Disease Specialist</p>
<p>Everyone knows that nocturnal emission in young people is very harmful to the body. But what diseases does it actually lead to! Perhaps even doctors find it difficult to know the details, because the human body is an organic entity, and the myriad changes in disease are difficult to predict. For example, nocturnal emission is generally considered a disease, but the disease itself is not nocturnal emission. Nocturnal emission is a symptom. We study why nocturnal emission occurs, mostly because self-pollution, debauchery, overwork, etc., weaken the nerves. A part of the sexual organs loses its function or becomes oversensitive, so it cannot properly control the function of the sperm gate, resulting in nocturnal emission. If nocturnal emission occurs too frequently, the nerves will become even weaker, and the metabolism will also decline. Too many old cells die, and not enough new cells are produced, resulting in a pale and thin complexion, weakened brainpower, insomnia, forgetfulness, tinnitus, blurred vision, headaches, and other conditions. These are symptoms of extreme weakness of the brain nerves. Lower back pain, soreness in the muscles and bones, fatigue in the limbs, and other conditions are symptoms of extreme weakness of the spinal cord nerves. As for spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, impotence, and dissipated energy, these are symptoms of extreme weakness of the sexual nerves. In addition, due to the obstruction of developmental function, it often leads to short stature, small local areas such as fingers, and sparse or even absent sperm production, leading to infertility. These are the inevitable diseases of young people whose nocturnal emissions are not treated. As for anemia, tuberculosis, premature aging, and shortened lifespan, although they are closely related to nocturnal emission, they are also concomitant diseases and vary from person to person. For the effective treatment of nocturnal emission, the best option at this time is to take "Ximituo Shi (希米脫氏) Sperm-Consolidating Tablets." This medicine can strengthen the sperm gate, calm the nerves, promote restful sleep, reduce dreams, and eradicate nocturnal emission. If nocturnal emission has already caused the aforementioned symptoms, you must also take the gonadal preparation "Sheng Zhi Su (生殖素)" to nourish the sperm, blood, brain, kidneys, and nerves. Continued use will completely cure the aforementioned conditions in a short period of time, and can also promote developmental function, boost metabolism, and achieve the effect of prolonging life and rejuvenating.</p>
<h3>Ironclad Facts</h3>
<p>— Recorded by Dr. Zhan Nianceng, Venereal Disease Specialist</p>
<p>(1) Nocturnal Emission and Spermatorrhea Can Lead to Premature Death in Young Men</p>
<p>Mr. Qin Zhilian, twenty years old, from Hangzhou, his father a real estate businessman, quite wealthy. Currently a third-year student at a high school in this city. Due to his intelligence and excellent character, but as the saying goes, cleverness can be a curse. Mr. Qin's romantic feelings blossomed early, leading to conversations and exchanges of love letters with female classmates, which became a habit. Driven by an intense longing, he couldn't help but indulge in the bad habit of self-pollution. Despite repeated attempts to quit, he failed to break free, resulting in weakened seminal control and subsequent nocturnal emission. Initially, it occurred two or three times a month, gradually increasing to five or six times. At first, it was triggered by dreams, but later it occurred even without dreams. This led to feelings of mental fatigue, memory loss, insomnia, and palpitations. With the slightest exertion, he experienced lower back pain and physical exhaustion. His grades, once consistently excellent, now often failed, putting him at risk of being held back. During spring break, he caught a cold and was bedridden for days, worrying that he would die young! Therefore, he specifically requested treatment (as stated by the patient). Mr. Qin came to this clinic for treatment at the beginning of last month. After diagnosis, it was determined that his condition was indeed due to untreated nocturnal emission. He was immediately instructed to purchase two boxes of the highly effective "Hemet's Spermatogenesis Pills" and two dozen vials of the reproductive gland extract "Reproductin," to be taken together. After the nocturnal emission stopped, he continued taking "Reproductin" while receiving Diemen's electrotherapy. After a month, he felt clear-headed, energetic, and the previously mentioned symptoms had completely disappeared.</p>
<p>(2) A Husband's Neurasthenia After Marriage Torments His Wife</p>
<p>Mr. Shen Kexian, thirty years old, works in the banking industry. After marriage, he experienced symptoms of impotency and occasional nocturnal emission, resulting in unsatisfactory or even non-existent marital relations. This was not only frustrating for him but also caused great suffering to his wife. He tried various tonics and supplements on the market, but they had little effect. Recently, he felt increasingly weak and sought treatment (as stated by the patient). After a detailed examination of his condition, he was instructed to purchase three dozen vials of "Reproductin," one box of "Hemet's Spermatogenesis Pills," and receive daily electrotherapy injections. After two months, Mr. Shen felt his strength and vitality restored, and all symptoms disappeared. The love between husband and wife deepened.</p>

<h3>### General Hird Meets British Ambassador to Discuss Countermeasures to the Far East Situation, Close Cooperation between Britain and the United States to Prevent Aggression, American Public Opinion Unanimously Concerned About China, Relationship between the Next US Presidential Election and the Far East</h3>
<p>The Far East situation has recently become tense due to the aggressive intentions of an Eastern nation to seize ports, Vietnam, and the Dutch East Indies. According to a reliable source in diplomatic circles of a certain democratic country, the British and American authorities have repeatedly consulted on their Far East policy and reached a consensus. Admiral Hird, commander of the US Asiatic Fleet, arrived in Shanghai from Qingdao aboard the USS Isabel the day before yesterday (the 4th) to attend yesterday morning's US Independence Day celebration. He then met with British Ambassador to China Sir Archibald Clark Kerr at the British Embassy residence around 10 am yesterday to discuss the situation. The content of the discussion is unknown, but it is widely believed that the British Ambassador and Admiral Hird discussed the current situation in the Far East.</p>
<p>Cooperation between Britain and the United States Pleases All Nations</p>
<p>According to a foreign observer, yesterday morning's meeting between Admiral Hird and the British Ambassador is strong evidence of the recent reports of close cooperation between Britain and the United States in the Far East, which is gratifying to China and other countries. The aggressors in the Far East are about to take action, ostensibly to support Germany and Italy, but in reality, they are purely self-serving, directly seizing the rights and interests of Britain, France, and the Netherlands, and indirectly threatening the United States. The reason for their delay is simply to wait for an opportunity. The main force of their military power is currently tied down by the Chinese resistance. If Britain and the United States strengthen their Far East policy and cooperate, it will surely give them pause.</p>
<p>Policy of the Next US President</p>
<p>The Millard's Review's editorial, titled "The Relationship between the Future US Presidential Election and the Far East," stated that it is impossible to predict whether the next US President will be Roosevelt, who has been elected for an unprecedented third term, or the Republican candidate Wilkie until the national election in November. If the American people want the Democratic Party to take a temporary rest and the Republican Party to take power, the Republican leader, in view of the seriousness of the current European war, may abandon his previous isolationist policy and have to</p>
<p>Assist democratic countries, as the Democratic Party has done. Wilkie's foreign policy, based on his past statements, can be summarized as follows: (1) Advocate for aid to the Allied countries in Europe, but not participate in the war; (2) Adopt a tough policy towards the Far East, but not oppose reaching an understanding with Japan; (3) Implement multilateralism; (4) Most importantly, expand trade and support the Western Hemisphere's</p>
<p>Economic power.</p>
<p>American investment in Japanese power companies amounts to more than US$350 million, but these enterprises have been arbitrarily taken over by the Japanese government and incorporated into political organizations controlled by the military. At the same time, the United States has a significant amount of investment and interests in China, especially the Shanghai Electric Tramways. Wilkie has always been known for paying attention to American investment and interests at home. Therefore, he will undoubtedly give careful consideration to the above matters in the future.</p>
<p>American Public Opinion Extremely Agitated</p>
<p>According to the North-China Daily News, an American who recently returned to Shanghai after traveling through the southern states of the United States said that American public opinion is quite shocked by the actions of the aggressors rampant in the world. Residents of a small town in the southern United States, after receiving news of the German invasion of the Netherlands, turned to support the Allied countries overnight. Even those who previously did not care much about the Allied countries immediately supported the United States giving all kinds of active assistance in order to achieve a quick victory. American</p>
<p>Anti-Japanese sentiment is also very agitated and deeply concerned about all news coming from China. Recently, newspapers have given priority to European news and moved Chinese news to the back, but The New York Times and the Chicago Daily News still publish Chinese news in a special position. Colonel Stimson, the new Secretary of War, has always been in favor of</p>
<p>Embargo on Japan</p>
<p>American people and parties at all levels are greatly influenced by this. The American continued, "While traveling in the United States, I discovered that the American people are very concerned about the current situation of the Chinese people, and many asked questions about it. The relocation of the Chinese people to the west has greatly moved the American people, and the relief efforts in the United States have been widely noticed. Generous assistance has been given from all sides."</p>
<h3>Xujiahui Observatory Continues to Work, Instruments Extremely Complex, Relocation Difficult</h3>
<p>After the retreat of the French Concession Police and the French Defense Forces in the Xujiahui area, the Xujiahui Observatory in the area continues to operate as usual because all meteorological, time, and earthquake observation instruments are extremely complex and difficult to move. It continues to make meteorological and time reports on time. The rumor that a small team of French soldiers remains stationed near the observatory for defense is not true. However, the observatory's work is all done internally, and all employees live and work in seclusion. Everything remains normal.</p>
<h3>Yesterday Celebrated US Independence Day, All Sectors Very Excited, Grand Ceremony Held at a Time of Serious Situation, Significant Meaning, Celebration Situation Enthusiastic</h3>
<p>Yesterday was American Independence Day. The weather was clear and sunny, and all the celebrations planned by the Americans in Shanghai were able to proceed as scheduled. The enthusiastic atmosphere cannot be described in words. American institutions in this city were closed as usual, but some shops were still open in the morning and closed in the afternoon. The American warships anchored in Shanghai, the Luzon and Admiral Hird's private yacht Isabel, were fully decorated with flags, fluttering in the wind, which was very beautiful. At 8:30 a.m., a flag-raising ceremony was held at the Columbia Country Club, with the US Navy Marine Band playing the American national anthem. In addition to the Marine Band, about 2,000 people attended. American officials in the city, such as Admiral Hird, Acting Consul General Putnam, Inspector General Hillmeck, American Association Chairman Macmillan, Columbia Country Club Chairman Morris, and American Chamber of Commerce Chairman Anderson, all attended the grand ceremony, which was quite solemn. From 12:30 p.m. to 2:00 p.m., the American Chamber of Commerce held a banquet, where guests raised their glasses to bless US President Roosevelt. Other ball games, picnics, and evening dances were also very enthusiastic.</p>
<p>Democratic Front</p>
<p>American Independence was declared in 1776, and the Declaration of Independence was formally issued on July 4 of the same year. At a time when the world situation is becoming increasingly serious, people from all walks of life are very inspired by it, because its meaning is especially important today. In addition to unanimously publishing reports on the celebration of Independence Day by Americans in this city, Western newspapers in this city also wrote commentaries. The British semi-official newspaper North-China Daily News devoted a special section to the text of the Declaration of Independence in a very important position. The article first reprinted a passage from the Declaration of Independence: "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness." The article added that at this critical moment, all democratic countries should stand on the same front to resist the same enemy. Britain and the United States are very similar in blood, political and ideological thinking, so American sympathy and assistance to the British will increase. The British side also hopes that this American Independence Day will give people great encouragement. The newspaper's editorial also praised the spirit of Americans in fighting for independence and freedom under the title of "American Independence Day" and believed that it should be emulated.</p>
<p>Fight for Freedom</p>
<p>The Continental Times' editorial, titled "The Zero Point of Democracy," stated: "Today, the United States celebrates its 166th anniversary of independence. At a time when democracy is on the verge of decline, the celebration of independence by the United States has a nature that should be valued by the whole world. The light of free people, that is, the pursuit of freedom, equality and happiness, has once again been challenged by tyrants who want to enslave it. Today, it can be called the zero point of democracy. But strong democracy has gained its greater power in the disappointing period of 1940. In any case, the freedom of individuals and nations can only be saved by resisting foreign aggression. Therefore, fighting for freedom is not a new discovery in human history. Democracy itself is a philosophy of war. American Independence Day is a symbol of the ultimate victory of mankind in fighting for freedom, and today millions of people are fighting for true freedom and light." The Times also wrote a commentary, and finally concluded its article by saying, "We should maintain this glorious day." In addition, various Western newspapers also issued special issues on this day.</p>
<h3>British Official Statement to be Released This Week, For the Service of Overseas Chinese</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a reporter from the Dazhong News Agency learned from British officials in this city that a formal statement regarding the plan mentioned by the British Ambassador in his radio broadcast last week, in which British overseas Chinese in this city are engaged in active service, will be released this week. The British Overseas Chinese Association in China recently discussed the issue of enlistment in this city and issued a notice to its members, stating the best way to support the British wartime fund.</p>
<h3>Obstacles in Front of the Post Office Building Have Been Removed</h3>
<p>After Mr. Chaplim, Director of the Postal Administration, went to Chongqing on official business in the middle of last month, Mr. Chaplim is expected to stay in Chongqing for up to one month, so he will probably return to his residence in about two weeks. The building of the Bureau on the Bund of Sichuan Road was suddenly cut off by the Japanese with barbed wire on North Suzhou Road, and it was extremely inconvenient for those entering and leaving the post office, who had to go through the Sichuan Road Bridge. However, since the second day, the Japanese removed the barbed wire fence they had set up, so the public can now enter and exit through the Henan Road Bridge and the Jiangxi Road Bridge. However, the Jiangxi Road Bridge is only allowed for the public carrying mail on foot, and vehicles still have to take the Henan Road Tianhou Palace Bridge. The Japanese army has now set up posts at the eastern end of the northern end of the Henan Road Bridge and at the bridgehead of the waterworks.</p>
<h3>Land Transport is Blocked, Freight is Sharply Reduced, Shanghai-Haiphong Shipping is Interrupted, Taikoo's Sichuan Ship Diverts to Hong Kong, Hong Kong-Haiphong Ferries Still Operate with Many Passengers</h3>
<p>Since Japan has stepped up its threats to Vietnam and Hong Kong, the situation between Hong Kong and Vietnam has suddenly become tense. However, shipping between Shanghai and Haiphong is proceeding as usual. Yesterday, news suddenly spread that shipping between Shanghai and Vietnam was interrupted due to blocked land transport and a sharp reduction in freight, resulting in losses for shipping companies. According to a source in the shipping industry interviewed by a reporter from the Pyeongmin News Agency, Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.'s</p>
<p>Tai Sheng sailed to Hong Kong and Haiphong yesterday. Whether the ship can reach Haiphong depends on the situation after arriving in Hong Kong. The ship set sail at 2 p.m. yesterday, carrying more than 300 passengers, including about 100 going to Haiphong. It is also learned from the shipping industry that Taikoo's</p>
<p>Sichuan, which was originally scheduled to depart for Haiphong today, decided to go to Hong Kong only due to the tense situation in Haiphong. According to the shipping industry, the Hong Kong-Haiphong ferries are still operating smoothly. Currently, the Xiao Guangdong and Hai Tan are operating back and forth between Hong Kong and Haiphong. However, due to the extraordinary number of passengers, it is extremely difficult to purchase tickets.</p>

<h3>Land Bureau Files Will Be Handed Over This Morning, No Indication of Protest Against Yu Hongjun, Rumors of Progress in Negotiations on Road Construction Beyond the Border</h3>
<p>Regarding the Land Bureau files, due to the concession authorities' concession, it will fall into the hands of the puppet regime. This move by the Public Works Department, whether in terms of law or sentiment, is a move that cannot but make people feel regretful, and the official act of entrusting the custody of this file during the Shanghai war is a violation of the agreement and greatly damages the interests of Chinese and foreign owners in Shanghai. However, when a reporter from the Dazhong News Agency specifically asked Mr. Philip Felling, Director-General of the Public Works Department, about this matter yesterday, he confirmed that the "handover" of the files will take place this morning as reported outside.</p>
<p>Philip Felling Answers Reporter's Questions</p>
<p>The reporter from the Dazhong News Agency first asked Mr. Felling if it was true that the 312 boxes of Land Bureau files would be "handed over" this morning, as rumored outside. Mr. Felling nodded and said, "Yes." The reporter asked about the "handover" procedures, whether the Public Works Department would deliver them to Japanese Consul General Miura. He replied, "Not sure." The reporter said, "Then will the consulates send someone to the Bureau to collect them?" He replied, "Probably so." The reporter further asked whether the Japanese side would transfer the files to the puppet "Municipal Government" after receiving them. Mr. Felling replied, "I don't know." At this point, the reporter asked how the Bureau would respond to Mayor Yu Hongjun's protest. However, Mr. Felling was unwilling to make any comment. The reporter then asked about the assassination of Mu Shiying and whether the puppet "Municipal Government" would protest to the Public Works Department with strong language, and how the Bureau would respond. Mr. Felling said, "Under consideration."</p>
<p>General Situation Reported in Western Newspapers</p>
<p>According to the Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury, based on the general opinion of city officials, the transfer of the Chinese Land Bureau files by the Public Works Department through Japanese Consul General Miura is rapidly approaching the resolution of several important issues affecting the normal situation in this city. The main outstanding case is the implementation of the agreement between the Public Works Department and the "Municipal Government" and the jurisdiction of the Public Works Department of the Public Concession over the area north of the Suzhou River, which will be resolved within a month.</p>
<p>Shanghai West Special Police</p>
<p>According to a source, "Mayor" Chu Xiaonan will submit his final reply within days regarding the establishment of a joint police force for road construction beyond the boundary in western Shanghai. It is understood that Major Bowen, Director of the Public Works Department of the Public Concession, has submitted his final proposal for the new police force, and it is now believed that the joint police force will be established soon.</p>
<p>Tax Revenue Issues</p>
<p>At the same time, the Public Works Department has already submitted the names of its representatives to discuss with the "Municipal Government" the second issue in the agreement between the two sides, namely the tax revenue in the road construction area beyond the boundary. The Public Works Department's representatives to discuss this issue will be Philip Felling, Gobi, and Mu Qiu. The "Municipal Government" has not yet announced the names of its representatives, but it is said that their names will be submitted at the beginning of next week to facilitate discussion.</p>
<p>Several Details</p>
<p>The last thing to be considered in the agreement is the jurisdiction of the Chinese court in the Special Zone. Officials believe that this issue is difficult to resolve because there are many technical points related to this issue. This morning, Tsurumi, a spokesman for the Japanese Embassy, told reporters that discussions between the Japanese authorities and the Public Works Department of the Public Concession on the more complete jurisdiction of the Public Works Department over all areas of the public concession in Binbei are still underway. There are still "many details" to be resolved, but negotiations have made smooth progress.</p>
<p>Land Files</p>
<p>This morning, those responsible for explaining the transfer of land files through the Japanese Consul General said that the Public Works Department received these files from a generally recognized group, and now it is necessary to transfer them to the current "Municipal Government" through a responsible party.</p>
<p>So-called Difficulties</p>
<p>Although the agreement signed by the Public Works Department and the "Municipal Government" in February of this year tacitly recognized the "Municipal Government" de facto, technically speaking, the "Municipal Government" is not a responsible group, and it is possible that both sides will soon make a more concrete form of recognition. The "Mayor" Chu Xiaonan has been cooperating more closely with the Public Works Department authorities, and the Public Works Department also wants to resolve the various difficulties currently encountered in this city.</p>
<p>Yu's Protest</p>
<p>Regarding the files, former Shanghai Mayor Yu Hongjun has protested, but the Public Works Department refused to make any comments on this this morning. According to the above-mentioned files, they were handed over to the Public Works Department for safekeeping by Mayor Yu Hongjun after the retreat of the Chinese army in the Shanghai War of 1937.</p>
<h3>French-Japanese Agreement Reached, French Concession Maintains Status Quo, Ougen Says Neither Will Take Actions Detrimental to the Other</h3>
<p>According to the Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury, it was learned from responsible parties today (the 4th) that the Japanese military authorities in Shanghai have guaranteed the French authorities in the city the integrity of the Shanghai French Concession and the status quo of the area. This compromise was agreed upon by the French and Japanese authorities last week when they discussed incidents affecting the situation in the city. Although Japanese officials refused to comment on this matter this morning, Ougen, the French Consul General in Shanghai, said that the two sides had reached this understanding. "We agreed not to take any actions that would be detrimental to the other party. This is a gentleman's agreement between the Japanese authorities and us."</p>
<p>Negotiated Agreement with Clauses</p>
<p>According to another source, the details of the agreement reached between the French and Japanese authorities on the French Concession issue are that the Japanese authorities, in addition to actually guaranteeing the integrity of the French Concession, also included a "secret clause" in the agreement with the French authorities, stipulating that the status quo of the French Concession will continue to be maintained for a "specified number of years" agreed upon by both parties. Other details are not yet known, but it is said that the authorities will fully cooperate in the future. As for the political issues and the right of the Japanese authorities to participate in the investigation of those engaged in political activities in the French Concession, the French and Japanese authorities have already reached an understanding.</p>
<p>Western Press Commentary, Temporary Relief</p>
<p>According to the English Millard's Review, published today, the unfortunate results of the European war have made French people unable to take care of the situation in the Far East. At this time, French people are supporting their motherland with economic and human resources without reservation. Therefore, the management and defense problems of the French Concession in this city have become increasingly serious. The occurrence of this new situation has led the French authorities to "transfer" the Xujiahui area to the Japanese side. In the</p>
<p>Current environment, maintaining sufficient defense force to protect the French Concession has also become a serious problem. Although the Japanese side is extremely willing to provide "assistance" to the French Concession, the French authorities are obviously trying to use diplomatic means to politely reject the Japanese side's request for "kindness." From the French point of view, France is weak, so it has to use the environment to try its best to maintain the status quo, and in necessary occasions, it has to</p>
<p>Forced to make concessions. Therefore, the former French Consul General Baudouin, who was known for his uncompromising stance against Japan, has resigned due to physical weakness. The current French-Japanese relations can be called "friendly," but at the same time, they are also very tense. The Japanese side is certainly able to break with France at any time, but the Japanese side obviously will not take this step at present, because the current situation is very</p>
<p>Quite favorable to Japan</p>
<p>An important French official said, "Japan is still mired in the quagmire of the war in China, so it only regards the Shanghai French Concession as a delicious food hidden in the refrigerator. When the time comes, it will be ready to eat it leisurely."</p>
<h3>Rice and Grain Evaluation Association Established, Rice from Hong Kong Starts to Ship</h3>
<p>Authorities Strictly Prohibit Irregular Transactions</p>
<p>The Shanghai Soybean and Rice Industry Association has resolved to organize the Shanghai Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee, which is responsible for rice and grain evaluation, dredging sources, statistics, investigation, and registration of rice and grain that has arrived and has not arrived. It has already obtained the consent of the two concession authorities, and Chen Ziyi and other 21 people in the soybean and rice industry have been designated as members. The association has now scheduled a founding meeting to be held at 3 p.m. today at No. 15, Rue Edouard VII. In addition to revising and passing the regulations, various important proposals will be discussed to stabilize the rice market in Shanghai as a whole.</p>
<p>Authorities Assist</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Soybean and Rice Industry, the Miscellaneous Grains Industry, and the Rice Store Industry sent Chen Ziyi and others to visit Mr. Ho, the Deputy Director of the Public Works Department of the Public Concession, again. Mr. Ho personally received them. First, the representatives reported separately, and then invited the two concession authorities to send personnel to participate and give instructions. In addition to providing assistance, Mr. Ho immediately issued an edict to carry out the work conscientiously. If there are any irregular transactions or secret deals in the future, they must be reported to the authorities for punishment. After bidding farewell to Mr. Ho, the representatives went to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, where they were personally received by Yan E-sheng, the secretary of the Chamber. Mr. Yan has already given them the constitution for examination.</p>
<p>Rice from Hong Kong Starts to Ship</p>
<p>Previously, the Hong Kong authorities, in order to prevent any unexpected events, prepared to forcibly evacuate European women and children in Hong Kong, and ordered the prohibition of ships from exporting in order to evacuate the population, so that the rice-loaded ships could not leave Hong Kong for Shanghai. However, rice speculators in Shanghai were active again, claiming that the source of foreign rice was interrupted, and the market was temporarily bullish and rice prices rose again. Fortunately, the two concession authorities managed to suppress rice prices and cracked down on speculation, and finally managed to maintain the original market. Yesterday, a reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned from the rice industry that there were more than 120,000 bags of foreign rice stored in Hong Kong. Now the Hong Kong authorities have allowed ships to export, and the stored rice has been shipped one after another. Within days, Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.'s Tai Sheng and Taikoo &amp; Co.'s Suiyang will have 50,000 bags shipped to Shanghai. As for the four ships that have ordered rice, they have already arrived at the port, carrying more than 20,000 bags of rice.</p>
<h3>German Intelligence Commissioner Denies Peace Talks</h3>
<p>The German Embassy in Shanghai quietly reported that Commissioner Koethe, at a reception for Chinese and foreign journalists yesterday, made a statement on the current situation in Europe. He stated that, in military terms, Germany is preparing a new situation to deal with Britain. This work will be completed quickly and thoroughly. This can be seen in the recent activities of</p>
<p>the naval and air forces</p>
<p>in various ports and coasts. Regarding the notice issued by the German Consulate General in Shanghai regarding the conscription of men born in 1911, Mr. Koethe clarified some misunderstandings in the Chinese newspapers. He said that this was based on the military service law promulgated by Germany on May 21, 1935. When a German citizen reaches the age of eighteen, they must</p>
<p>report for inspection.</p>
<p>Those in the country should report to the competent military authorities, and those abroad should report to the local consulate. Finally, a reporter from the Dazhong News Agency asked whether the recent news reports about British-German peace talks were true. The spokesperson stated responsibly that although the rumors of British-German peace talks were published in newspapers, he could</p>
<p>responsibly prove</p>
<p>that this propaganda was definitely not issued by the highest German authorities. Therefore, Germany has followed Britain's lead in denying this news. Since the outbreak of the European war, the so-called Allied countries have all been individually defeated by Germany. Therefore, the current European war situation has become a solo operation by Germany against Britain. How can there be any talk of peace talks?</p>
<h3>Seaport Parcel Service Temporarily Suspended</h3>
<p>The Parcel Post Administration of the Postal Administration has notified that due to transportation difficulties, all parcels sent to Haikou (Qiongshan) and those transshipped through it are now temporarily suspended.</p>

<h3>Increased Insurance Rates for Merchant Ships; French Territories and French Merchant Ships Refused Coverage; British Insurers Still Fulfilling Terms</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the European war, the international situation has changed rapidly, and the safety of navigation has become increasingly serious. Insurance companies first stopped accepting war risk insurance for merchant ships traveling to Northern Europe and the Mediterranean. Recently, they have decided to temporarily stop accepting war risk insurance for merchant ships traveling to French territories or directly belonging to France. The war risk insurance rates for ships traveling to other regions have been increased again: (1) Britain and Ireland: 10 yuan per 100 yuan; (2) Africa (south of the equator): 4 yuan per 100 yuan; (3) West Africa (north of the equator): 5 yuan per 100 yuan; (4) Persian Gulf: 3 yuan per 100 yuan; (5) Americas via the Cape of Good Hope: 5 yuan per 100 yuan; (6) Americas via the Panama Canal: 1 yuan per 100 yuan; (7) Americas via the Pacific Ocean: 1 yuan per 100 yuan; (8) Australia: 2 yuan per 100 yuan; (9) China, Japan, Philippines: 1 yuan per 100 yuan; (10) Ports west of Hong Kong (to Singapore and the Dutch East Indies): 1.5 yuan per 100 yuan; (11) Ports west of Singapore and India: 3 yuan per 100 yuan. The above rates are calculated from Hong Kong and have already been implemented.</p>
<p>British Insurance</p>
<p>Business Unchanged</p>
<p>British merchants occupy an important position in the local foreign insurance industry. Since the outbreak of the Second European War, various questions have arisen, and there have been unsettling images between insurance and underwriting. However, during the British House of Commons meeting in February of this year, when Member of Parliament Peter Lawrance asked the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Sir Simon replied that there would be no changes to the overseas business of British insurance companies and that the terms of the policies would still be fulfilled. The bill is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Foreign Currency Compensation;</p>
<p>Fulfill According to Policy</p>
<p>Extract from the British House of Commons bill of February 8 this year: Question—Insurance Companies (Overseas Business). Member of Parliament Peter Lawrance (asked) the Chancellor of the Exchequer whether the Treasury's financial regulations have any restrictions on the overseas business of British insurance companies, especially for foreign currency compensation. Sir Simon (replied) that the Ministry has a complete plan to ensure that the overseas business of British insurance companies can proceed smoothly and without hindrance, and that compensation for all Allied and neutral countries and British families, whether in British pounds or foreign currency, will be fulfilled according to the terms of their policies.</p>
<h3>Cheap Coal Briquettes Coming Soon</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Mechanical Coal Briquette Industry Association held its 36th joint meeting of factory representatives on the 25th of last month and decided to continue to hold the 7th period of cheap coal briquette sales from July 11th, scheduled for ten days, selling until the 20th. As the deadline approaches, the industry association has scheduled the 37th joint meeting of factory representatives to be held at the Tianjin Road Clubhouse at 3 pm on the 9th of this month. At that time, it is expected that the following will be discussed: (1) Please decide on the location for cheap sales; (2) Specify the quantity of briquettes that each person can purchase per purchase, and the selling price. It is understood that all sectors hope that the association will reduce the selling price of non-cheap coal briquettes to lighten the burden on the common people. It has been learned that a large amount has recently arrived and unloaded in the warehouses in Pudong and Puxi, and the freight cost has recently decreased, so the manufacturing cost of coal briquettes has been reduced.</p>
<h3>Rainbow Around the Sun the Day Before Yesterday, Due to Reflected Light from Moist Clouds, Often Found at the North and South Poles</h3>
<p>According to the French-language Shanghai Daily, a strange phenomenon was discovered in the sky between 1 and 2 pm the day before yesterday, that is, a rainbow around the sun in the clear and sunny sky. According to some people's speculation, this seems to be related to the future climate, while superstitious people say that there will be huge changes in the situation in Shanghai. According to some experienced Chinese people, this kind of clear rainbow phenomenon should be a harbinger of floods or hurricanes that are about to come, which is also unknown. However, according to a priest at the Xujiahui Observatory, this is probably a kind of solar halo, which is often found at the North and South Poles, but is rarer in Shanghai. According to the priest, the principle of this solar halo is the same as that of a rainbow, that is, there are moist clouds between the ground and sunlight, which form the action of a prism and emit colorful light. According to the priest, this phenomenon is indeed a sign of strong winds, but according to the current observation, there are no hurricanes coming near this port, and the hurricane in the South China Sea is still staying in the Caroline Islands, which is still far from Shanghai.</p>
<p>Cause of Solar Halo</p>
<p>At 1:30 pm on July 3, a colorful strange shape suddenly appeared around the sun. For a time, it was rumored to be a spectacle, but it was actually a solar halo. All kinds of strange light phenomena in the atmosphere are collectively referred to by this term. The source of solar halos is clouds formed by ice crystals, which are reflected by sunlight, just as sunlight rings are formed by water droplets. However, the shape of solar halos changes more than sunlight rings, because the shape of ice crystals is very mixed, so sunlight is reflected by ice crystals and can be refracted in many ways. Solar halos can indicate the nature of clouds. For example, if the sky is pale white, it is not a day of falling sand, but because of thin cirrus clouds. In this kind of weather, solar halos are prone to occur, and they are often a sign of strong winds, as the saying goes, "a lunar halo means wind".</p>
<p>Common Shape</p>
<p>The shape of ordinary solar halos is a ring with an inner radius of about 22 degrees, with red inside, and sometimes yellow, and the remaining colors are mixed and cannot be distinguished. The color in the ring is generally darker and less clear than the sky elsewhere. The outer ring, with a radius of 46 degrees, is lighter in color, but each color can be clearly distinguished, with red inside and purple outside. The above two types are common solar halos, but what is usually seen is that the clouds cover the entire sky unevenly, so it cannot be as clear and beautiful as this time. Lunar halos and solar halos are similar.</p>
<h3>Old Sassoon Firm Sues for Rent Increase; Jicheng Pharmacy and Others Object;</h3>
<p>The Public Concession Board of Directors decided to increase land taxes, house taxes, and other taxes starting in the autumn of this year, and has officially announced that it will begin collecting them on July 1. The Waterworks Company had already increased water rates highly last month. The above three taxes have a huge impact on the lives of all citizens, and are also sufficient to cause rent increases. Therefore, recently, Chinese and foreign landlords have been using the excuse that land taxes and water expenses have increased to</p>
<p>propose rent increases</p>
<p>to sub-landlords. The sub-landlords, in turn, are using the increase in house taxes as a reason to notify third-party tenants to increase their rents. These disputes are now in full swing. This morning, Magistrate Mo Runhua heard the case of the British Old Sassoon Firm suing to order Jicheng Pharmacy, Lao Dafang Teashop, and six other households to</p>
<p>increase their rents by 30%</p>
<p>from July of this year to the end of June of next year, and ordered the lawyers of the plaintiff and defendant to transfer their clients to make concessions to each other and conduct reconciliation. However, the lawyer for the tenant immediately explained in court the reasons why the defendant could not accept the rent increase, saying that Old Sassoon had already used the increase in water rates as a disguised rent increase to each defendant twice in the past year. Although it was stated on the rent receipt that the increase was for water expenses, so that the tenants could gain some benefit in terms of paying house taxes, even if the water expenses are expensive, there is a limit.</p>
<p>If increased again,</p>
<p>if discovered by the Tax Office of the Public Concession Board, it would be detrimental to the tenants. Moreover, this is the third rent increase, which is really difficult to accept, etc. The lawyer for the plaintiff stated that the prices of real estate and building materials have all risen in recent years, and other expenses have also increased. It is necessary to increase the rent by 30% to offset the expenses. After the two sides debated, out of respect for the court's advice, they unanimously stated that they would go outside</p>
<p>to try to reconcile. It is said that Old Sassoon Firm has a lot of houses located at the corner of Nanjing Road and Henan Road (i.e., the Ball Field). This time, it is very determined to increase the rent for all tenants. Some tenants have already reached a peaceful resolution under considerable conditions.</p>
<h3>Counterfeit Trademark, Defendant Fined</h3>
<p>The Yin Dan Shi Lin cloth trademark issued by the Defu Foreign Firm at 261 Sichuan Road is widely sold and has been legally registered. Recently, in order to reward customers, a gift certificate is attached to each bolt of cloth. If 20 certificates are accumulated, they can be exchanged for a beauty picture from the firm. 250 certificates can be exchanged for five yards of cloth. For the sake of prudence, each gift certificate is stamped with a watermark. Recently, the firm suddenly received a batch of gift certificates from a customer in Wuhu to exchange for gifts, and found that each certificate had no watermark, and knew that it was counterfeit. A staff member was sent to Wuhu to investigate, and it was found that the counterfeit trademark cloth was sold by the Fuji Cotton Cloth Store (owner Yuan Weixiang) at 11, Lane 46, North Wuxi Road in this city. A report was made to the General Patrol Room, which sent detectives to investigate and learned that the counterfeit trademark was commissioned by Chen Guoan, the owner of Renchang Cotton Cloth Store at 12 Jixiang Lane, Henan Road, to Xu Nanhua, a runner at the Xinya Printing Press opened by He Yingjie at 26, Lane 438, Baike Road, to print a total of 55,000 sets, which were sold to Yuan Weixiang of Fuji Cotton Cloth Store by Chen via Huang Rengao, Zhang Lanhe, Xu Arong, and Zhu Yunzhang for mixed sales in the city. The patrol room arrested all the above-mentioned criminals and seized 706 sets of counterfeit trademarks at Fuji Store. The next morning, they were sent to the First Special Court for legal proceedings. After Judge Feng Shide concluded the trial, he announced the judgment in court yesterday morning: "Main text" He Yingjie, Xu Nanhua, and Yuan Zhengxiang jointly intended to deceive others and counterfeit a registered trademark, and were each fined 1,500 yuan. Chen Guoan was guilty of the same crime and was fined 3,000 yuan. Huang Rengao was guilty of the same crime and was fined 800 yuan. If the fine is converted into labor service, the total amount of the fine shall be converted in proportion to the number of days in six months. Zhang Lanhe, Xu Arong, and Zhu Yunzhang were guilty of the same crime and were fined 500 yuan. If the fine is converted into labor service, it shall be converted at the rate of 3 yuan per day. The counterfeit trademarks were confiscated.</p>
<h3>Beating a Foreman to Death; Son of the Criminal Arrested and Sentenced</h3>
<p>Feng Amao (42 years old), a native of Shaoxing who worked as a foreman at the British-owned Lulin Printing Company at 531 Avenue Pétain, was highly trusted by the company's manager. In November of last year, the workers asked Feng to ask the manager to increase wages and provide rice subsidies, etc. Feng did not comply, which angered the crowd. On the 15th, a strike was carried out. At 7 am that morning, Feng Amao went from home to the company. When passing near Jingzhou Road and Huade Road, he was surrounded and brutally beaten by more than 20 workers with iron objects and tap water pipes, and died from his injuries. The murderers fled without a trace. Until 1:30 pm on June 13 of this year, Tang Guangfu, a Chinese detective from the Hongkou Patrol Room, received a tip and arrested three suspects, Hu Akang, Wang Songhe, and Kong Qingxiang, all natives of Ningbo, in the vicinity of Avenue Pétain and Dalianwan Road. They were sent to the First Special District Court, where Judge Huang Risheng conducted a thorough investigation and remanded the three defendants for sentencing. Yesterday morning, the patrol room sent the three criminals Hu, Wang, and Kong to the Third Criminal Court. Patrol Room lawyer Zhang Tianyin stood up to wait for instructions. Judge Huang announced the verdict: Hu Akang and Wang Songhe were sentenced to seven years of imprisonment each for causing death by injury. Kong Qingxiang was sentenced to five months of public warning for aiding and abetting the same crime.</p>

<h3>Examination of the Manchurian Situation (2)</h3>
<p>Fifteen hundred li northeast of Ningguta, on both banks of the Su Song River and the Hun Tong River, is called He Zhe Kara, and four or five hundred li further northeast, residing around the confluence of the Wu Su Li, Songhua, and Hun Tong rivers, is also called He Zhe Kara, which is also the dog country. Further northeast, crossing the Hun Tong River seven or eight hundred li, is called Fei Ya Ha, all the way to the northeast coast, three thousand li from Ningguta, is called Qi Le Er, which is the deer country. These are all on the northern route. Going upstream from the Hun Tong River to the north of the Heilong River, at the foot of the Outer Khingan Mountains, between Russia and the Khalkha Mongols, there is the Solon tribe. Around the Nen River, there are the Xibe, Gualeza, and other tribes. These are all hunting and gathering tribes, interspersed between the Mongols, relying on this to defend against strong neighbors and protect China internally. Those who live in Jilin today are not all Manchus. Each follows the customs of their tribe. The Han people are from all thirteen provinces, and many have been exiled here. They also each follow their own customs. The city walls are made of bricks and stones, surrounded by wooden fences two or three li long, which is called a city fence. The Eight Banners reside inside, and scholars and officials who have been demoted also live among them. The rest are scattered in various villages. In the early days of the dynasty, the customs of the people were docile and simple, and no one picked up lost items on the road. Traveling hundreds of li, one did not need to carry provisions or buy forage, and traded with millet and cloth. But recently, the atmosphere has gradually changed, and it is no longer as it used to be. In the early days of the dynasty, the Manchus were brave and good at fighting. There was a saying that getting a Korean talent was not as good as getting a Mongol, getting a Mongol was not as good as getting a Manchu.</p>

<h3>Bargain Clothing for the Week</h3>
<p>— Fitting Hope</p>
<p>The oppression of life truly makes one breathless. Although one is determined to live by the motto of saving on food and clothing, one cannot save to the point of having nothing in the stomach, and one must ensure one is adequately clothed. In the third summer after the war, my summer clothes were truly no longer suitable for wearing to the office. After careful consideration, I decided to abandon Western suits and switch to Chinese attire. This is because the materials for Western suits are all so-called "imported goods." Converting the limited legal tender into foreign exchange prices, the cost of making a Western suit might truly leave the entire family with nothing to digest. As for Chinese attire, naturally, one can forget about materials like silk and satin. Even the most basic fabrics are frighteningly "rising" amidst the "phone calls" of speculative friends. So, although the plan was decided, after visiting several silk and satin shops and cloth stores, I still hesitated to "execute" it. Eventually, I became foolishly reading the advertisements in the newspaper every day, hoping to stumble upon a big bargain opportunity that disregarded all costs. As fate would have it, one Sunday morning, I discovered a rare opportunity. Calculating from the prices in the advertisement, making a long gown and two sets of shirts and trousers would probably cost less than twenty yuan, including tailoring. So, disregarding the fact that it was a day of rest, I got up early and rushed to buy the bargain goods. However, I returned disappointed because they were "sold out!"</p>
<p>Bargain goods are naturally sought after by everyone, so they are only available for a short time on Sunday mornings. However, since an advertisement has been placed, one cannot be casual, or even close to deceptive, because I believe I arrived "early" that day. The fact that they were "sold out" cannot help but make people suspect that there were no bargain goods for sale at all.</p>
<p>The silk and satin shops and cloth stores after the war can be said to be making money. Sacrificing a few types of clothing materials every Sunday morning would not be cheap to the point of losing money. So why use deceptive tactics to make fun of poor friends? At the same time, this is detrimental to commercial ethics and a suicidal policy that destroys one's own credibility! Therefore, if you are truly sincere in making sacrifices, you should at least set a time and sell as much as possible within the specified time. Otherwise, simply sell expensive clothing materials, and the poor have no way to access them!</p>
<h3>Big Belly in a Famine Year</h3>
<p>— Contemporary</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "Big belly in a famine year." This saying is actually based on sound scientific principles. First: In years of rice shortage, other foods will certainly not be cheap. As a result of eating fewer snacks and miscellaneous foods, one naturally eats more rice. Second: Rice is expensive, as are meat, oil, and various vegetables. Rice cannot be saved, so one has to save on side dishes. Eating fewer side dishes means eating more rice. At the same time, with the reduction of meat and oil, the stomach lacks fat, and digestion is quick and easy. In other words, one gets hungrier and can eat more rice.</p>
<p>Having a big belly in a famine year is truly a great misfortune within misfortune. But everywhere you look, there are "maggots" who only care about their own bellies and not the bellies of the public. Alas!</p>
<p>Hawthorne's Investigation</p>
<h3>The Final Destination of the Dancing Queen</h3>
<p>— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter Two: "A Page of History!"</p>
<p>I already have a considerable understanding of Jinmei's thoughts. Her tone clearly puts the suspicion on Zhao Boxiong, while trying her best to exonerate Yu Gantang. In fact, one can discern her psychological loves and hates simply by listening to her different ways of addressing these two people. But why is she like this?</p>
<p>I couldn't help but interject, "Since Miss Wang spoke up for Zhao Boxiong when they were arguing, it's clear that her feelings for the Zhao fellow are closer than for the Yu fellow. Then why did the Zhao fellow seem to want to make things difficult for her last night?"</p>
<p>Jinmei only glanced at me sideways, lowered her head, and stared at the carpet, ignoring me.</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou also agreed with my view and continued, "That's right! This doesn't make sense. Jinmei, what do you say?"</p>
<p>She simply replied, "I don't know."</p>
<p>Hawthorne seemed uninterested in our questions. He continued to ask, "Jinmei, did Yu Gantang come yesterday after all?"</p>
<p>She still shook her head and said, "No." She was still admiring the pattern on the carpet.</p>
<p>Hawthorne stared at her, and his tone became heavier. "You'd better tell the truth."</p>
<p>Jinmei reluctantly said, "I don't know."</p>
<p>"That's right. Yu Gantang may have come yesterday, but you didn't know. Right?...Okay, what kind of business does Yu Gantang do?"</p>
<p>"He doesn't do business. He studies at Jiangnan University."</p>
<p>"Oh, a college student!" He was silent for a moment, seemingly sighing to himself. Then he suddenly seemed to remember a new topic. "Ah, I forgot, when you and Master Li heard the gunshot last night and went downstairs, what about the old woman?"</p>
<p>Jinmei replied, "She was still in her room and hadn't come out."</p>
<p>"Does she also live on the third floor?"</p>
<p>"No, she sleeps downstairs behind the kitchen."</p>
<p>"Didn't she hear the gunshot?"</p>
<p>"She said she didn't hear it. It wasn't until Old Mao went out to find Manager Lu and Miss Jiang that I went into Wu Ma's room to wake her up." (35)</p>
<h3>Moore Memorial Church Raises Rice Price; Appeals on Behalf of the Poor</h3>
<p>— Wei Kang</p>
<p>The Moore Memorial Church on Yu Qiaqing Road in this city, due to soaring rice prices and the difficult lives of the poor, began selling affordable rice before the New Year at a price of one jiao per catty in national currency. It was sold every morning, greatly benefiting the poor. This was truly a significant act. However, "there were more monks than porridge," and the rice was often insufficient to distribute, so most people who came every day left empty-handed. Recently, we suddenly heard that the church, due to the large number of poor people buying rice, decided to slightly increase the selling price from today onwards to limit the number of buyers, raising it to 1.5 jiao per catty in national currency. We were very surprised to hear this move by the church, and at the same time, we cannot help but appeal on behalf of the poor!</p>
<p>The reason given by the Moore Memorial Church for raising the price is to limit the number of people, but please think carefully, what will happen to the group of poor people who are eliminated under the 1.5 jiao price? The even more tragic consequences are imaginable. Isn't this contrary to the Moore Memorial Church's main purpose of selling rice to help the poor?</p>
<p>Therefore, we cannot help but ask the Moore Memorial Church to consider this carefully, because "limiting the number of people and raising the price" is not a good solution, and it cannot be regarded as a reason for raising the price! At the same time, we hope that Shanghai philanthropists and charitable organizations will quickly find ways to jointly support the Moore Memorial Church's charitable act of selling rice at affordable prices to help the poor, so that it can always achieve the purpose of benefiting the poor.</p>
<h3>Correction to "Subsidies for Impoverished Students"</h3>
<p>— Wang Pei</p>
<p>In Mr. Simon's article "The YMCA and YWCA Subsidize Impoverished Students" published in this newspaper on the 3rd, there were some slight errors. As I am a recipient of the association's subsidy, I have more detailed knowledge and would like to supplement and correct it as follows:</p>
<p>The association was founded in the autumn of the 26th year of the Republic (1937), after the "August 13th" Incident. Its purpose is to subsidize outstanding students in Shanghai who have been affected by the war, so that they can continue their studies. It is named "Shanghai Student Relief Committee". The funds are raised by the YMCA and YWCA from American churches and schools.</p>
<p>The subsidy amount is 50 yuan per high school student and 70 yuan per student above the junior college level. (Mr. Simon mentioned 30 yuan for high school students and 50 yuan for junior college students. This was the subsidy amount for the previous session. This session, due to increased tuition fees in various schools, the subsidy has also been increased.) Students applying for subsidies can pick up the "Application Form for Relief Students" at the Student Life Mutual Aid Society of the YWCA on Jing'an Temple Road from July 1st. There are no other procedures for picking up the form. The form must be submitted in person with transcripts or other supporting documents and two photos before the 8th. (It is best to submit it before the 6th, as the association will hold an exam on the 9th of this month, and it will be closed on the 7th. Submitting it on the 8th may be too rushed.) The more detailed the form is filled out, the better, because if it is filled out too simply, the committee will have no way of knowing whether the family is impoverished and whether the student's character and academic performance are excellent. In particular, the applicant's special skills, extracurricular activities, what kind of books and magazines they read outside of school, and the family's economic situation are more important. And the applicant's economic budget for the next semester must be detailed in order to know whether the applicant needs a subsidy. An admission ticket can be picked up upon submission of the form. The exam location is Jiang University on the sixth floor of the Cishu Building on Nanjing Road, and the time is from 7 pm to 9 pm on July 9th. The exam content is nothing more than general knowledge and current affairs. The results will be announced about a week after the exam. Those who pass the preliminary exam must take a second exam (oral exam), and those who pass the second exam can receive the subsidy. Subsidized students must perform several hours of volunteer work each week.</p>
<p>The association originally subsidized 200 students (half for junior colleges and universities, and half for high schools). Now, because the number of out-of-school youth in Shanghai is increasing, this session will add 100 students, enrolling 150 high school students and 150 university and junior college students. Students in need of subsidies can quickly pick up the form, because the form still needs to be stamped by the school, guarantor, and parents, and picking it up too late may not allow enough time to complete the procedures.</p>
<h3>Respectfully Questioning the YMCA Student Department</h3>
<p>— Xu Fei</p>
<p>In May, the YMCA Student Department held an essay contest. The topic was "Shanghai Students Today". The genre was divided into novels, reports, essays, etc. The deadline was May 20th. The top ten winners each received book vouchers worth five yuan and were eligible to apply for tuition subsidies for the next semester. Those who were ranked after the tenth or were not selected would also receive a copy of the compilation "Shanghai Students Today". The announcement date was June 1st. The news of this essay contest was published in various newspapers. The various schools also received the regulations sent by the association. At that time, I wrote an essay and sent it. However, the results were not announced on June 1st. Afterwards, I eagerly turned over the newspapers every day and inquired with friends close to the YMCA, but there was no news. An old classmate told me that he had only heard of an essay contest for Christians, but not one for "Shanghai Students Today," and that it had already ended, and that he knew nothing else. Therefore, in addition to guessing, I wrote directly to the YMCA Student Department to inquire, but still received no reply. Now that July 1st has also passed, the results have still not been announced.</p>
<p>Therefore, I must sincerely ask the officials of the YMCA Student Department to publicly reply: What exactly is going on with this essay contest? When will the results be announced? (Repaid)</p>
<h3>Epidemic Prevention and Disinfection</h3>
<p>— Plum</p>
<p>Mr. Kuang Xihua's article "Getting Vaccinated" can be said to explain in great detail what vaccinations are for those who generally do not understand them. At the beginning of this scorching summer, everyone can get vaccinated without hesitation. However, the white-clad angels administering vaccinations on the street are a bit too perfunctory. For example, they take a tube of medicine, grab passersby, and inject them under the skin one after another, without paying attention to the amount, and without wiping the needle neck with alcohol for disinfection. In this easy negligence, it may lead to unfortunate consequences. On the other hand, we naturally forgive them, because there are too many passersby on the street, and they cannot inject as calmly as in a hospital. But paying attention to the following two points is not very troublesome: too much injected medicine is not suitable; and the needle should be disinfected after each injection. This is the responsibility of every doctor, and should not be neglected because it is fulfilling an obligation.</p>

<h3>The World Changes in an Instant: The Difficulty of Filming Current Events</h3>
<p>— New Film</p>
<p>Hollywood film companies have recently wanted to shoot some current events films, but international events are changing too quickly. When a film company has finished writing a script and wants to start filming, the international situation has completely changed, and it has to change its plans and stop filming. As a result, the only film related to European current events currently being filmed in Hollywood is Paramount's "Mystery Ship." Although this film depicts a naval battle near Uruguay, it includes a battle in the North Sea.</p>
<p>Indeed, Hollywood has many stories that narrate scenes of the European war, especially German Nazism, such as MGM's "Escape" and "Mortal Storm." These all belong to this category of films.</p>
<p>Universal has a new film, the story of which is taken from war news, and was completed when the Finnish war ended. It is called "Sea Patrol." This trend is now common in Hollywood, the film city. Generally, film companies want to find subject matter from newspapers, turn current events into stories, and shoot films. The only drawback is that international events really change too quickly, and even if film companies use the most agile means, they sometimes cannot film time-sensitive films in time.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, Hollywood screenwriters have been "particularly busy recently. When they discover new events that can be used as film material, they quickly write scripts based on news reports under the company's authorization, so that the company can quickly shoot the films. This trend has become particularly evident since the outbreak of the European War in September last year!</p>
<h3>The Theatrical Life of Tang Ruoying</h3>
<p>— Feng Ling</p>
<p>This seems to require no introduction. As for Miss Tang Ruoying, because of her family's background, her theatrical life must be very fulfilling. Sure enough, when I met Miss Ruoying and talked to her once, my ideal was completely confirmed:</p>
<p>Before the flames of the August 13th War broke out, she was comfortably studying at Qixiu Girls' High School on North Sichuan Road in Hongkou. After graduating, she was preparing to enter Soochow University in Suzhou, and had already been accepted. Unexpectedly, the war broke out, and the whole family traveled around with the troupe, performing and striving to promote the essence of drama. Naturally, she also followed. When she was studying, because of her inherited nature, she had a very strong interest in drama, and often performed short one-act plays in the name of the school troupe, but she had never officially stepped onto the stage.</p>
<p>When they arrived in Hankou, they lived there for a long time. She studied at a girls' school and formally engaged in theatrical life. The first play she performed in was "Green Yarn Tent," written by Mr. Ouyang Yuqian. Later, she went to Hong Kong, where she worked alone in Guilin for about half a year. Therefore, she played the leading roles in the China Travel Theater's "Night Light Cup," "Thunderstorm," and "Sunrise." In the blink of an eye, it has been more than a year and a half.</p>
<p>Now, she is studying at the Faculty of Arts of Aurora University. Because it is summer vacation, she can take some time to guest-star in various plays. In this "Female Shopkeeper," she plays the leading role of Du Jiuniang, the female shopkeeper. The story is very humorous and funny, and she performs purely in a comedic style, which can be said to suit her personality.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Star National Opera Troupe Performer Qi Meiyu, also known as Green Peony's Dance Costume (Gifted by Xiuzhen)</h3>
<h3>Parachute Troops on the Silver Screen</h3>
<p>— New</p>
<p>In this European war, the German parachute troops have been praised by the whole world with surprise and admiration. Everyone is eager to know how Germany is training these awe-inspiring soldiers.</p>
<p>Now, regarding this issue, Germany has already made a film. At the beginning of June, when the Berlin authorities were hosting foreign journalists, they introduced this film to them. It is said that it will soon be shown in theaters everywhere.</p>
<p>After watching the film, anyone will be more interested in the term "parachute troops." It turns out that parachute troops first need to undergo army training. They are required to do an indoor exercise every day, which is to practice somersaults on thick blankets. For the skills of jumping from an airplane, the practice method is to jump from high buildings into sand pits that have been dug on the ground. In addition, several other cumulative courses must also be taught to each paratrooper. The most important thing is how to handle themselves freely during the landing process. The last part of the film is about showing their divine power. They use light weapons that are packed in boxes and dropped from the plane at the same time when they land. The parachute troops on the screen can also be said to have recorded an unprecedented miracle in the film industry!</p>
<h3>Tang Jie and Zhu Bingxin — There is a Possibility of Renewing Old Bonds</h3>
<p>— Taigong</p>
<p>Tang Jie, known in the film industry for his "Mr. Wang" film, entered the film circle when he was only nineteen years old. Speaking of history, it is actually quite long.</p>
<p>The matter between Tang Jie and Zhu Bingxin has been going on for a long time. Later, due to some relationship, the two broke off their relationship and separated. Now, Zhu Bingxin is in Hong Kong, engaged in hugging for a living.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I met Tang Jie on the road. During the conversation, I learned that Tang Jie had never forgotten Zhu Bingxin. According to Tang, he had recently sent a letter to Zhu Bingxin in Hong Kong, explaining his love and that he had never forgotten her for a day. A few days after this letter was sent, Tang Jie received a reply from Zhu, saying that it was not impossible for her to return to Shanghai and renew their old relationship, and that she was also very happy, but she would have to wait two months before she could put it into practice. The reason was not explained in the letter.</p>
<p>Judging from this, the renewal of old bonds between Tang Jie and Zhu Bingxin can be achieved very smoothly. Then let's wait and see the renewal of old dreams between Tang and Zhu in two months.</p>
<h3>Quirks of Hollywood Stars</h3>
<p>— Wen Qin</p>
<p>Although Miram Lona is young, she likes to call people "kids." When you are in a restaurant and suddenly hear an out-of-tune and funny whistle, followed by a sound like splitting bamboo: "Hey! Kid!"—this is to let you know that the film emperor has arrived.</p>
<p>If you see a tall, thin man at a gas station on the road, insisting on putting the gasoline into the car himself, only Warm Morris, the protagonist of "Giant Valley," has such a quirk.</p>
<p>The taciturn Gary Cooper likes to light a cigarette alone in a nightclub, concentrating and meditating, and constantly rubbing his nose (we can also appreciate this expression on the screen from time to time).</p>
<p>Heidi Lamarr has a strange makeup technique: she likes to apply rouge near her nostrils, which is said to make her look particularly beautiful.</p>
<p>Penny Lan, who jumped to become one of Hollywood's top ten stars in 1939, loves to eat onion and meat bread, and must chew gum after eating.</p>
<p>The so-called hot man, Charles Boyer, does not want to play poker with any woman.</p>
<p>Singing star Alan Smith always asks the band conductor to play his favorite song, "Star Dust."</p>
<p>George Brent likes to wear shirts with the collar turned up and without a tie.</p>
<p>Penny Barrence's right thumb nail is often painted with a small British emblem, but it is not visible without careful attention.</p>
