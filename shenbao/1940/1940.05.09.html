<p>社評</p>
<h3>日本外交的透視</h3>
<p>檢視近數年來世界各國的外交，其間似乎極活躍而實際最瞀亂的，似乎極權變之能事而實際最徬徨的，似乎佔盡便宜而實際一塲空的，似乎最能利用他國利用機會而實際終於自欺自凟的，普天之下，厥惟兩國：一是波蘭，一是日本。</p>
<p>波蘭旣借重了德義軸心。又復結托於英法集團；就近則對於捷克，對於立陶宛，先後肆其趁火打刼；迢遠則甘冒大不韙，承認所謂『滿洲國』，以獻媚日本；呼籲反侵略，却又想自躋於力能侵略的强國之林。到現在，不但悖入悖出。加利繳還，並且全國族淪陷於蘇德兩國控制之下。可憐他吧，置之不論。</p>
<p>至於日本：兩三年來，於侵略中國之外，只看見他的外交，在對英美蘇德的親善或讐視之間兜圈子；更復對於法屬越南則示威，對於葡領澳門則壓迫，對於荷屬東印度則覬覦。種種行徑，似乎目光四射，左右奔突，亦幾令人有眼花撩亂之感。這種外交戰術，大概是自陸奧宗光林董以來的日本外交當局所未曾夢見的。然而成就如何？</p>
<p>日本不但目前一無成就，終必自食其果。但是亦有不可忽視的，因爲日本在外交術數上，亦自有其萬變不離宗的根本基調，他正以鍥而不舍的精神，分頭猛幹。請看本月四日日外相有田在日本國際會社演說，力斥日人所唱膺懲英美對蘇開戰一類的狂妄高調，主張實行諷整美蘇關係。有田一向是最能代表日本軍部急進意見的外交家，曾經一手締結反共公約，並且是去歲反英運動的策動者，現在儼然以老成持重的態度來誥誡國人，安得不令人發生意外之感；但是。這不是有田的反常，却是日本的術數。有田又說：「美人對日之情感雖殊惡劣，但吾人當勿激怒彼等」：攷日方最近一次激怒美國的行動，却便是有田親自發表的準備染指荷屬東印度的聲明。前後相距不過二十天，態度不同若此，這也恰好說明了日本外交的善變。</p>
<p>從原則上來看：外交並不能發揮獨立的機能，在平時則附屬於政治，到戰時則隸從於軍事，而且外交也只能補政治軍事所不及，絕不可能以外交轉變軍事政治方面的基本事態。在日本當局似乎具有這樣一種錯覺：總是把外交認做點金術中的「哲人之石」（Phalosopher‘s　Stone）看待，以其在政治軍事方面所不能成就的企圖轉而期望之於外交方面；一切由其基本國策所引出來的艱難困窘，都要責成霞關當局來打開。這是任何國家外交當局所從未遭遇的難題，其無所成就，顯然不僅是日本一般外交家低能之過。這種情勢於是就促成了日本今日對外政策的畸形姿態，顯得日本內心的徬徨。那種愚妄高調，赝懲大言，固屬島民褊狹激越的國民性使然，也未嘗不是日本外交上的一種作用。有如去夏英日東京談判的進行，便是這種軟硬兼施戰術的成效。西方國家對日的接觸，從玻理提督時代至今已近百年，却往往總缺乏深刻的理解：以近年事實而論，除却穌聯那種深沉機變的外交策略有時使日本啼笑皆非而外，其他國家總不免被日本那種故意造作的外交姿態所蒙蔽。日本當局雖未能滿足其以外交濟軍事政治之窮的大願，其視西方國家爲可欺以其方的念頭，則至今仍在繼續</p>
<p>此度有田的演說，警誡日本國民的意義尙在其决，而其所期待的，却是西方各國接受這種東洋貨的媚眼。日本外務省發言人須磨於本月一日表示願與亞洲各小國或屬領締結互不侵犯條的以保障遠東現狀，其用意也正和有田演說相同。蓋有田四月十五日關於荷印的聲明已引起美國惡劣反響：菲律濱的新移民法案又限制了日人向菲島的移殖：美艦隊淤太平洋大操之後有長期留泊遠東的消息：加之，美國會在六月休會之前，畢德曼等所提的對日禁運案父有重加考慮的可能。這種種的壓力，都逼迫着日方要對美採取溫和態度以博取好感。據說此次美駐菲島專員賽爾訪日時，有田曾經竭力卑辭結歡，那也正是與上述有田須磨那種表示互爲經緯。</p>
<p>然而這一切都不過是表面的姿態，那旣不能代表日本眞正的對外路綫，更不足以影響其基本擴展政策：也許日閥就準備在這一糖製的外衣之下暗暗伸出可怕的侵略毒手。自從有田聲明在國際方面遭遇打擊之後，日方對此一問題已不甚加以宣揚，但却小要誤會日閥眞就會知難而退。日本的南進企圖，有其多年的處心積慮與實際的着着佈置，尤其際此侵華戰爭師老無功的現在，斷不會放鬆這近在咫尺的無限寳藏。據昨天的消息：荷蘭與德國間的關係業已緊迫萬分，想見日本的勃勃野心，又是躍躍欲試了。</p>
<p>美國在遠東的堅定立塲固屬無可懷疑，其措置却每嫌過涉持重或迂緩；而日本就是針對此種情勢，在外父上賣弄姿熊，用以弛緩美國激昂的輿情。與其亡羊補牢，何如當機立斷；這是最近歐陸事變所給予的敎訓，願美國切勿在遠東再蹈英國在歐洲覆轍。</p>

<h3>挪境軍事挫衂　英下院大開呑戰　反對黨責政府措置失當　要求將現行政策付表決</h3>
<p>倫敦　反對派工黨國會黨團、於本日午前十一時三十分舉行會議、由該黨領袖阿德里少校主席、討論政局、歷一小時餘始睪、當即決定於下議院本日晚間開會時、要求將政府所待政策、提付表決、其方式有二、（一）對現內閣提出不信任案、（二）對於政府所提出下院休會之動議案表示反對、特政府派各議員尙不願公然譴責政府、工黨「爲顧及彼等情感起見、或當採取第二種方式、對現內閣表示不滿、特政府仍可獲有多數票之擁護云」、（八日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<p>倫敦　英首相張伯倫昨在下院發言旣畢、反對派工黨領袖阿德里少校·反對派自由黨領袖辛克萊·曁保守黨議員海軍上將凱葉斯爵士、均曾發表演說、抨擊政府在挪威戰事中之一切設施、茲將三氏演詞分誌於次、</p>
<h3>阿德里　指摘弱點</h3>
<p>阿德里少校發言時首先對於英法挪軍熱烈讚揚、對於挪威民衆表示同情、及對於在艱難中實行撤兵之技能表示欽佩、阿氏繼稱、吾人在上决戰爭中已有撒兵經騐、此次則因空中襲擊更爲困難、此誠可驚異的戰續、然歸根結蒂、此乃退却、星期四日首相演辭、似過樂觀與滿意、而邱吉爾之演詞則更爲樂觀、首相雖勸吾人勿作忽遽判斷、然無效益、蓋在首相與海相演詞中、巳有若干甚忽遽之判斷也、就事實言、實難謂此次戰事有利於吾方、如首相星期四日所言者然、首相今日語調已變、托詞解釋不一而足吾人固不願予敵以話柄、但吾人對於國人負有研究業已發生的各事之責、吾人須應付事實、且亦不畏事實、今之事實乃挫折是、閣員對新聞記者及在無綫電中而發之演說滿抱希望、余以爲對民衆演說鼓勵其百事進行異常良好之幻想而興奮其精神、實屬失策、余意當局不應有之、而應予以更多之指導、吾人現感覺痛苦、因在甚大期望之後發生失望也、吾人皆知心中必須牢記更大的戰略之需要、但此非出軍遠征稍觸即退之謂、</p>
<p>從未取得主動</p>
<p>最初一般意見、以爲德國已伸頭待擊、英國已有展開戰事之機會、今之尤感失望者、實由於此、聞吾方在此戰爭中、從未取主動地位、且未有預防敵方可能的攻擊之眞正計劃、政府固有用水雷阻斷那維克路綫之念、然德國反攻之極大可能性則顯然可見、政府對此可能性作何準備、此乃第一問題、首相曾謂德國以甚大之審慎、歷長久之時期、作遠征挪威之計劃、然則協約國在其擊敗德國此種進攻之計劃中、其審愼爲何如乎、三月間政府吿人有士兵十萬人準備開赴芬蘭、並聲明此軍已有完善準備、果爾則吾人欲知此軍何在乎、芬蘭戰事三月間吿終、而政府四月八日在挪威海岸外敷設水雷之決定、係在芬蘭戰事結束以後、余意政府旣擬數雷、自須保留此軍以防德方反攻、然則政府是時何爲遽將此軍分散、此余大惑不解者也、余聞若干軍隊保持未散、則余欲知此　軍隊是否敷用、是否有必要之配備及載運所需之飛機船隻、余更欲知此軍是否優良軍隊、余曾聞我方有受訓練而能滑雪之軍隊一批、準備參加芬蘭戰事、旋又聞該軍已分散、派充他種工作、當挪威旣有發生戰事可能時、何故分散此軍乎、民衆現以此軍應吾開往挪威爲問、余曾聞遣往挪威者　殊少訓練的靑年之說、挪威氣候酷寒、應派往者須爲富有經騐年齡較長之戰士而非靑年、昔年吾人曾派靑年前往韃靼尼爾、致彼等不能耐戰、前之經騐尙在、是以今所需者乃適應各種氣候之人、至於德人料及英國將有敷雷行動乃侵入挪威一層、政府果會從情報員接獲何種情報乎、</p>
<p>戰略鑄成大錯</p>
<p>據首相以前發表之言論、吾人早知德國及運輸艦曾屢作登船之演習、目德國或將發動侵略之國家有四五處之多、一時殊難斷定、余固知在德國獲得情報極感困難、但吾人在挪威方面必有情報機關則可斷言、故在挪威及丹麥境內對此籌備已歷多月之周密計畫、竟毫無所聞、殊難令人置信、余願知吾人會吾獲得任何情報及對於所得情報曾吾加以正當之利用、據余所知、吾人對德國參謀本部之侵佔挪威計畫、已籌備多年、余願知吾人曾否進行一切以對抗之、</p>
<p>立即引起余注意之問題、即爲關係重大之根據地事件、第一條件須勿受空中及海上之威脅、時間一層自亦爲極重要之因素、德軍祇在若干選定之地點派遣少數軍隊登岸、倘使彼等有充分之時間、自將續派增援軍隊、致令協約國軍隊之登陸極感困難、目下最重大之事即爲空軍根據地之獲得、此舉雖爲危險之行動、但必須冒險以赴之、余願知政府是否早有決策抑或臨時忽促行動、實際上那維克確屬决要、而斯達文格或特隆漢則爲眞正重要之地點、就情形而觀、政府直至事後似仍未認識空中武器之重要、余對於首相所言殊感不安、政府雖目擊波蘭與芬蘭所得之敎訓、而對於空防之重要似仍未有認識也、</p>
<p>延誤不能辭咎</p>
<p>余今所問者、即是否及時採取行動、德軍在特隆漢之登陸、距離吾人在南案斯及安達爾斯納兩地登陸之期已踰十日、政府進行計畫並維持軍隊以應付此項意外、果至如何程度、殊屬疑問、吾人旣不能獲得一空軍根據地、撒退雖屬難免、但南挪軍事失敗之事實、固不能因此而有所改變、有謂吾人可重新開始並由那維克進攻者、此事實極端困難、此外更有阻止德方之增援亦屬軍要、吾人雖不能在空中阻止德援軍、但吾人對於海軍艦隊之行動、自抱有較樂觀之希望、吾人考慮此次開始撒兵之時、有一重大要素、即對於防阻敵方增援能成功至若何之程度、吾人更須承認挪威人民所能發動之聯合防禦能力、尙在不可知之數、依余之見、吾人之計畫事前似未以機敏之先見加以思量、吾人無充分之機警、並對於各種主要目標缺乏必要之集中、不知在任何需要行動之時、果無延誤及討論吾、</p>
<p>余對於目前戰時內閣爲進行戰事之有效率的工具一說、雖有首相之種種說辭、但仍不能認爲滿意、本院已再三加以抨擊、其他富有經騐者、及各報與講壇之言論、亦均認爲內閣原則錯誤、加以批評、目前如能獲得勝利、則尙有可說、但此項勝利並未實現、余坦白承認以邱吉爾任海相兼參謀長委員會主席、殊屬不合、</p>
<p>阿氏發言至此、首相攙言謂邱氏將不任主席、並不出席每决參謀長之會議、阿氏續稱、擔任重大軍機之人物、同時更令其指揮某項特殊部份之專宜、殊蜀違反一切軍略及組織之常例、邱氏已有種種極大之困難、今使其處於不可能之地位、殊欠公尤云、</p>
<p>諸公領導無方</p>
<p>阿特里父稱、吾人今遭一决失敗、吾人之友爲之失望、但吾人從前屢有失敗、而吾從未稍搖動必獲勝利之信念、（衆歡呼）當吾人遭遇失敗時、吾人須從失敗中獲有敎訓、此乃極重要者、（衆歡呼）余深信國人之勇氣與毅力、祗須有適當領導耳，（反對派歡呼）吾國人民無論其觀念如何及思想如何、未有不焦慮而認戰事未以充分精力決心積極進行者、苟政府對此無所見聞、則必旣盲且聾、政府種種舉動失宜、挪威事僅其最近者耳、說者謂、負行政上主要責任者已有幾無間斷的失敗史、（反對派歡呼）挪威捷克波蘭以及任何他處、皆失敗於「過晚」、首相曾言及「誤車」、實則政府自一九三一年以還、誤車不止一决、其所錯過者爲和平車、而其所乘着者則爲戰爭車、</p>
<p>政府諸公判斷恒錯、彼等以爲希特勒不致攻擊捷克、並以爲希特勒可以就範者、似亦未料希特勒之進攻挪威、綜之彼等處處未能握住事實而應付之、此不獨在國防與外交方面爲然、即在國內亦復如是、迄今政府猶未調整國家之資源、開戰八月、凡此事件早應舉辦、但至今日食物或人力皆未有何組織、此乃缺乏有效能的領導之故、全國士氣乃生反響、</p>
<p>泰晤士報社評謂、首相之弱點、在眷念非已失敗、即需要休息之同僚、要知際此生死關頭、吾人不能使其命運操諸業已失敗或需要休息者之掌握、余不確知首相有此弱點、但政府派之議員確有此弱點、彼等非不見失敗屢作、然旣知之而猶容之、寗使其對於黨魁之忠貞、抹煞其對於國家眞正需要之忠貞、（反對派歡呼）下院於此必須擔紀整個責任、全國今皆抱必勝之情緒、但欲戰勝、則秉國鈞者勢必易人、而異於引領吾人入此危局之人物云、（衆歡呼）</p>
<h3>辛克萊　滔滔發言</h3>
<p>自由黨辛克萊繼起發言首對在挪協約軍之勇敢、致歙佩之詞、繼謂參謀長對於辯論中容或有之發展、感覺惶慮一層、渠不以為異、但惜首相已言之矣、辯論必絕對自由、不容有來自外方或來自軍人或來自任何方面、指導辯論應如何的進行之建議、政府挪威撤兵之決定、阿特里已發言抨擊之、余不欲續有指摘惟聞政府此種決定由於參謀長所發欲奪取特隆漢現無成功希望之勸吿、自余觀之、政府在此環境中、依軍事顧問之言而行事、固屬正當、今吾人所欲指摘與調查者爲吾人何以遇此不得不承認在挪失敗的境界之問題、此雖非軍事上重大失敗、無足撼動吾人對於軍隊勇氣與效率之信任、但亦可見在吾人作戰努力之最高指導中、須有更遠大之眼光、更偉大之魄力、與更堅强之決心矣、</p>
<p>豈可埋首沙中</p>
<p>吾人在挪失敗之軍事上影饗、縱不可與上决大戰中吾人所遭遇者相比擬、然已足使人不歡、余不欲奢言過甚、但吾人必須應付事實、而不可埋首沙中、傷亡之數非無足介意者、而物質之喪失、亦非細微已甚、吾人已喪失戰具若干、軍艦多艘、而此種物質之目前供給、一時尙不敷需要、軍事上影響如此、而其他方面之影響較此更爲嚴重、首相對於此事、在經濟方面之關係未置一詞、實則吾人已喪失來自挪威丹麥瑞典與波羅的海各國之各種接濟品矣、波羅的海今已封鎖、吾人不復可問津而吾人從那維克運入之五七〇、〇〇〇噸礦砂、今後恐亦將斷絕矣、他日吾人奪回挪維克時、將見德人已將該處有價値之各物悉數摧毀矣、</p>
<p>對外威望挫弱</p>
<p>冉以外交言、吾人在世界各國之地位、已因在挪軍事之失敗而挫弱、我方有閣員所發未有充分根據之自滿言論、而敵方則有其軍隊所作堅實而迅速之打擊兩相比較殊爲可憐、在戰爭中可算數者爲結果而非空言、我國報紙與廣播亦皆受嚴重打擊、首相責瑞典京城傳來消息之粉飾過甚、余亦認來自瑞典京城之新聞淆惑聽聞、但英國新聞記者英屬地報紙之訪員、以及外國新聞記者、咸向余責備若干公報使人誤會之性質、公報盛稱軍隊登陸之功續、使人發生一切良好之樂觀、即新聞界中人、亦因此對於眞正局勢發生誤會、</p>
<p>一切缺少準備</p>
<p>在經濟政治宣傳與軍事方面、吾人無處不失敗、究其主因、則吾人作戰努力未在各部與政策各方面以全副堅決戰爭精神支持而推進之也、如英軍早有準備、則不出十日應已開抵挪威而在德軍以其飛機抵境之前矣、吾人應早有準備立即出動之有力軍隊、吾人早知危機之眞確性、吾人亦早應同中立國作彼等應目準備及吾人願予以眞正援助之宣言、奈何吾人竟無此準備、時局之關鍵、不在那維克而在特隆漢、蓋特隆漢者乃勝負所繁之軍略上要點也、今德軍旣據有之、英國通入挪威之最好門戶、乃從此關閉矣、使特隆漢之佔領爲不可能也、則挪威遠征軍耶不應出動、使特隆漢之佔領爲可能也、則遠征軍之出發、宜以毅然不顧一切之決心支持之、</p>
<p>敵我相形見絀</p>
<p>德國縱已犧牲其艦隊三分之一、然其艦隊已相助獲取德國海軍從未有過之勝利矣、首相詆德國在調入援兵時、不顧兵士生命、惟德方在斯加基拉克一役之損失、估計爲萬人、必屬估計過甚、然以此爲一個勝利的新式戰役之代價並非爲多大犧牲、德軍從奧斯陸積極推進、而我軍則在特隆漢之外躑躅徘徊</p>
<p>軍隊配備不全</p>
<p>應遣往挪威者爲久經訓練之戰士而非地方軍隊、此　阿特里言之已詳、余贊成其說、而政府對此軍隊未予以如雪鞋等之置備、余尤不能無言、某處有高射砲兩尊運岸、但旣無適用之砲架、又無適當之砲手、更無指示彈程之儀器表、致兩尊高射砲全失效用、又有一運輸船未置凖確之時計、亦無風雨表或國際電碼書、船上未備軍器、雖來復槍亦無之、而所帶食物亦復不數、船中有傷兵若干、但無醫藥照料、佈置小善、竟一至於是</p>
<p>最後言及瑞典</p>
<p>辛克萊言至此、海相邱吉爾起立有所詢問、辛氏答稱、余願秘密將此船之名吿知海相云、辛氏最後言及瑞典、謂一二星期內端典接到哀的美　書亦意中事、今瑞典已被包圍、不知英國今尙能援助瑞典以拒德國之侵犯乎、時間非久遠屬於我方、希特勒於此已握住老人之鬚矣、吾人果欲獲取勝利乎、則吾人非在精神上與行動上有同樣之迅速不爲功云、</p>
<h3>凱葉斯力為　海軍辯護</h3>
<p>海軍大將凱葉斯戎裝起立、衆報以歡呼聲、凱氏謂或指英海軍逃至亞力山大利亞、此實可惡之侮辱、（衆大笑、議長亦附和之）繼謂英海軍未隨德國軍艦與運輸船入挪威各港而毀之、如在那維克之所爲、此非海軍之咎、渠意海軍在特隆漢攻擊之艱險、較諸渠前所組織與指揮其他諸役中所克服之艱險、實屬細微、此可以挪威負責情報爲佐證者也、自四月十六日以還、渠曾促請海軍部當在挪威取更積極之行動、而任渠負組織與領導攻擊之全責、海軍部吿以駛入特隆漢灣並無困難、陸軍進步良佳、故無需及海軍之必要、且地中海目前之大局緊急、故不欲軍艦在特隆漢冒險作戰、渠復嘗建議以舊艦担任此役、即有損失亦不致影響艦隊之實力焉、</p>
<h3>愛梅立主張　改組政府</h3>
<p>繼保守黨議昌愛梅立起稱、作戰行動之全部、就所知言、應作澈底查究、（衆歡呼）今日除忠於共同主義外、無他忠可言、（全院歡呼）渠覺首相之演說中無一語表明政府會豫鑒德國意欲何為、或於已知德國所為之時、會作明白之決議、或在此可悲事件之全局中會作迅速或堅決之行動、挪威戰事之一頁、非爲單獨之一頁、而與否人答應芬蘭請求軍火援助之呼籲及處置戰爭各問題之猶豫遲鈍有關已往八個月中德軍與我軍間罅隙、已見加廣、實無疑義、吾人照目前之所爲、實不能有所爲、故必予以改革也、（反對黨大歡呼）下一打擊隨時有發生之虞、或在荷蘭或在地中海、未可豫必、吾人必須從速建設最高戰爭指揮處、吾人必須有與上决大戰時勞合喬治內閣相同之適當戰事內閣、反對當切實担任彼等應　之真正責任、而組成真正全國一致的政府、今憶為其時矣、</p>
<h3>陸相史丹萊　結束辯論</h3>
<p>陸相史丹萊發言結束第一日之辯論、謂　意衆對於首相頃在院所述及關於參謀總長之言、或已具錯誤之印象、陸相答覆挪威戰事之責言曰、侈言我軍已往數星期中之扭衂實屬無謂、余意稱此爲禍厄、亦屬可笑、惟若予以藐視、則將同樣危險、妄稱人與戰品之損失或尙小、威望與士氣等　之損失或不致大、亦屬同樣危險、余意全國所受之震動、由於人民誤信報紙與無綫電所傳無　方根據</p>

<p>之種種消息、遂抱我軍正獲勝利之見解、乃益見增重、此爲甚確之事實、至於我軍獲得勝利　節、任何人靜心一觀地圖，不能信以爲實也、陸軍部所發公一報、對於戰情未加渲染、陸軍一部每發公報、輒審愼起稿、志在勿使國民抱有樂觀、或使彼等認爲我軍業已獲勝、蓋實情我　並未獲勝也、不意國民仍具虛偽之樂觀、此實大可扼腕者也、　相繼重申首相所述解散　蘭遠征軍之言、請下院明瞭今日政府之心思雖完全集中於挪威、但在已往數星期或數月中、受危　之地、非僅芬蘭一處也、政府早接消息、知德國軍艦已凖備待發、此確爲實情、德國之將攻擊挪威、亦顯爲一種可能性、且確過之、余今須坦白承認者、余殆與政府諸同僚然、吿以爲德國之攻擊、將施諸挪威南部、而非挪威西部各港也、諸　如欲揷擊政府、則諸君至少當考慮吾人所處挪威請助之情勢，吾人自問吾人之聰敏曷爲未明白使吾人確知德國之計畫、或確知挪威之地位、德國計畫之內容、不易知之、殆如其欲在此間獲得消息然、挪威政府全不知德國之計畫、至四月九日農挪威之大局突然大變、甚至在請助吾人之前、全國各口岸各飛塲各兵工廠均已降服矣、吾人遣軍在各處登陸、非盲然不知其困難、吾人亦非盲然不知天空之困難、蓋挪威已無一飛機塲可供吾人利用也、就政治言、可謂因我軍在挪威登陸、已在全世界喪失威望、但吾人所喪失者不大、假使我軍未圖在挪威登陸、則所失之威望、恐將尤甚焉、（八日路透社電）</p>
<h3>英下院　辯論之第二日　張伯倫接受工黨挑戰　馬利遜指首財空三相不能稱職</h3>
<p>倫敦　今日下院繼續辯論挪威事件時、勞工反對黨動議對政府作戰態度作一表決、以測騐下院之情緒、首相張伯倫予以接受當時歡呼之聲大作、此挑戰之動議乃由工黨議員馬利遜提出、馬氏抨擊政府處理挪威戰事之失當後、指明張伯倫西門（財相）賀輛（空相）三人不能勝職、此三人未避免戰爭視任何人負責爲巨、並宜布勞工反對黨將於今晚試騐下院之向背、馬氏致詞旣畢、首相即一躍而起曰、馬利遜頃間所發之言論、使余不得不在此階段中作一二次之干涉、馬氏發言之始、切言此事之嚴重性、渠向政府全體所作之挑戰、渠對政府諸員尤其對余本人所作之攻擊、已使事件更形嚴重、余爲政府之領袖、當然接受政府行動之基本責任、而余之同僚對於政府之行動，亦不遲疑接受彼等之責任、惟事體之嚴重、非因人的原因、吾人全體苟失本院之信任、無一願留職須臾、事體之嚴重實因余昨日曾警吿下院、此際爲國家阽危之日、吾人現與殘暴之敵對峙、必須以全國團結一致之行動與之博鬥、抨擊政府、固屬義所當爲、余雅不欲圖避責難、惟余當吿知本院我之友好者、余在本院殊多友人、（政府黨大歡呼）即一切政府苟非獲得民衆與國會之贊助、無一能進行戰爭獲得效果是、余今接受挑戰、余確歡迎之、至少因此一舉、孰爲贊助吾人、孰爲反對吾人，可以分曉、余願請我友在今夜運動中贊助吾人、（衆大歡呼）</p>
<p>倫敦　下院今日開始挪威戰事第二日辯論時、倫敦工黨秘書馬利遜切實陳說挪威事件之嚴重性、謂吾人如嚴責政府處理之失當、並涉及某某入物、絕非因黨見而出此、任何人凡有助於獲得勝利者、余將對之歌功頌德焉、辯論進行愈深、愈覺閣員辦事之顢預、當受重大之譴責、尤可憾者、海相邱吉爾負戰事之重大資任、今將最後發言、俾其所提出之證據免受評論、馬氏又謂凖備開往芬蘭之遠征軍竟予以分散、實屬駭人聽聞之行動、渠不知政府曾吾重視所予挪威之保證、認爲吾人作戰之重要部分、抑僅聊盡道德之義務、藉免受人抨擊而已、馬氏機發問曰、政府最初得悉德國圖進攻挪威丹麥爲何時乎、德國運輸艦行動之第一情報何時傳到乎、傳到後距眞正行動有幾久乎、馬氏父述及在挪威領海敷設水雷事、謂在欲爲之事未爲之前、預先使希特勒知吾人將有何作爲、此誠大爲不智、政府應早將船港海灣飛機塲予以測量、俾知何地可以用兵、而迅速到達該處、就現情觀之、此類工作似全未爲之也、（未完）（八日路透社電）</p>
<h3>張伯倫　演辭全文　（續完）</h3>
<p>尙有一事不可忘者、即運輸英法軍隊需有許多船隻、而船隻須準備多時以待遣用是、德人不能用其船隻於公海、儘可使其船隻久待、直至彼等認爲侵略中立國時機已熟之時、但吾人則處境不同、吾人可利用每噸船位以裝運食物原料軍火戰具前來本國、決無長期準備船隻以待出兵斯堪的那維亞半島或可有的機會之理由、吾人固已準備若干軍隊、以便於德國破壞挪威中立之後、佔領挪威若干口岸、吾人當時確有理由相信在大軍未登陸時、有遣派在比較上人數不多的軍隊佔據此種口岸之必要、迨在佔領後、雖與在南案斯與安達爾斯納登陸之軍隊相策應、然軍力究嫌單薄、不足以恢復其地位、最後乃發生吾人旣覺特隆漢戰事不能久支、吾人應吾撤兵、抑或增援再圖一試之問題、余以爲增援再攻、固屬正當、而在進攻計畫顯非成功希望之時、撤回軍隊亦屬未可厚非（衆歡呼）</p>
<p>挫折原因厥有兩端</p>
<p>此番之失敗、原因有二　爲吾人未能獲有可供我戰鬥機利用之機塲、一爲德方援軍開抵之迅速、吾人常以爲如吾軍能登陸、則不致大受空襲之援失、以事實證之、此種預料不錯、惟吾方戰鬥機之未能活動於前敵、致敵方得破壞我方之交通、阻止援軍之前進、而敵方自己交通則使敵方援軍源源到達卒佔優勢、至是形勢已明、有吾人欲維持在特隆漢之我軍、則必從吾人全部資源中撥出甚大部份、集中戰士戰具與戰機而後可、吾人乃決定不如以更大力愛與更大效果、作戰於挪威他處之爲愈、幸賴各方面之技能與勇氣、我軍卒順利退出特隆漢區、余對於重要指摘之點、現已答復、至於技術問題、關於我軍編制與配備等事、則余留待同僚詳言之、但余願對下院陳述一般觀察、</p>
<p>勝利誰屬言之尚早</p>
<p>第一、余請議員勿對巴有之結果遽加判斷、德國此時固得若干勝利、但已付重大代價、（衆歡呼）今日遽請勝利將屬何方、實屬過早、戰事今尚未結束、挪威大總份並未入德人之手、挪王與政府仍在挪境、將重振旗鼓、會同協約軍共同禦敵焉、挪威外相谷特發表播音、勸吿挪人忍耐堅持、其言誠爲扼要、吾人當以其可能者儘速援助挪威、惟吾人必不可忘者、除挪威外尙有其他陣綫隨時可發生烈火燎原之勢、德國以其龐大强盛之陸軍、處於可隨時對於任何一點加以攻擊之地位、吾人須準備應付來自任何方面之攻擊、（會塲中大呼「注意、聽之」）愈重要之點、吾人應愈有凖備、</p>
<p>希特勒誤車之詮釋</p>
<p>閣員之表示樂觀者、常被人認爲自滿、而不表示樂觀者、則被視爲頹喪、余則勉力行於中庸之道、（一議員大呼「汝已誤車矣」）、余旣不作未必能實現之過分期望、（有人大呼曰「哦」）、亦不使國人懷抱無限悲歡、余前謂希特勤誤車、聞者以爲係指德侵挪威而言、其實余發此言時、在德侵挪威之前三日、（聞者譁笑）余之本意、係謂在吾方正籌議和平之時、彼方業已備戰、此乃全能國佔先之處、在戰事初作時、德方軍械與配備皆較吾人爲優、乃希特勒不乘此雙方優劣形勢最爲顯著之時、向協約國進攻、是謂失時、一故以誤車喻之、此與後事無關、一不過爲前事之批評耳、</p>
<p>強敵當前切忌內訌</p>
<p>余以爲挪威戰事之意義、被人過分誇大、而余對於最俊勝利、仍抱完全信念、惟余有必須言者、余以爲本國人民尙未了解吾人當前的威脅之程度與迫切、（衆歡呼）苟吾人非愚、則吾人當從威脅學得許多有益的敎訓、余非謂吾人將來戰略將如何改變但謂挪威之經騐，已表示景象變遷如何迅速耳、故吾人宜謹防勿受分散其力如敵所願之引誘、强敵在前、此非吾人內訌之時、（衆歡呼）但爲整其隊伍咬緊牙關各竭其力、共謀勝利之日、吾人在此辯論中、對於將來予以保證、軍事顧問會莊嚴警吿吾人以舉行此種辯論之危險、並力勸勿作此種辯論、但吾人不能接受其見解、蓋在民治國內、勢必有訾議、而受訾議者儘可自辯也、閣員四人與作戰有直接關係者今將發言、苟無所洩漏、則幸甚、各人皆愼防離間舉動、如謂某閣員對於某種舉動應負更大責任、則直爲無價値，亦非正確之言論、吾人彼此並無異見、更無傾軋之謀、吾人唯有一心一德、即如何作最好頁獻以致勝利是已、</p>
<p>反對變更內閣形式</p>
<p>余知國會內外有人建講或要求改組內閣、余現不爲人的問題發言、但余對於以多年經騐組成合乎意法之內閣、不能無言、余同事漢開·邱吉爾·與余、皆以爲純以無部務者組成之內閣、未必能節省時間或有更迅速之決議、因在決議時、萬不可忽視須執行此決議之人、必須使負責執行者出席於決定犬計之會議、而表示其意見也、是以閣內或閣外並無眞正區別、皆須負決定大計之責任、余之不願接受改變內閣形式之建議、非謂余不願隨時更易閣員或其職務、如余認爲與有益於公共利益、余亦不辭下野以讓賢能」</p>
<p>籲請團結應付時艱</p>
<p>余兮一再籲請各黨、際此時艱各致其力、聚精薈神以增進作戰努力、（衆大歡呼）勿斤於政府之形式、凡飛機坦克車大砲軍火及裝配軍需、使其適用的各種物件之產量、吿爲吾人所應致力者、吾人製造此等物件、必須有組織有毅力有好意、就吾人供職政府者而言、吾人正傾全力、以期追及德國凖備多年而得之起點、吾人今日已得僱員與工人之竭力合作、余並欲獲得各黨之合作、以進行吾人全體公認爲目下需要最殷之工作、</p>
<p>邱吉爾氏職責重大</p>
<p>海相兼陸海空三相會議主席邱吉爾、此後將負逐日監督軍事行動之特殊責任、且已獲指導參謀長委員會之權、邱吉爾接受內閣軍事調整委員會主席之職後、本其所得經騐、建議最好渠能與各參謀長有更密切之接觸、庶渠可予內閣以更有效之贊助、余認邱氏此意良佳、乃與陸海空三相詳細討論、然後設法由內閣代表軍事調整委員會授權邱氏、對於參謀長委員會予以指導、而由該委會籌擬計劃、以進行其向邱氏報吿之目的、各參謀長皆保持其對內閣與陸海空三相而負之集體責任、惟邱氏將負逐日監督軍事行動之特殊責任、如是、吾人方得軍事政策上任何方面均獲硏究、而所決政策、迅獲實施之保證云、</p>
<p>答覆勞合喬治質問</p>
<p>首相言至此、勞合喬治揷問、邱氏保持其現職吾、首相答稱、邱氏是否覺其新工作使其難以再擔任海相職務一層、余將聽邱氏自決之云、首相又稱、邱氏並未在挪威戰事發生以前獲此新權力、爲上述目的起見、邱氏將有個人參謀數名、而此參謀團則以加入參謀長委員會之高級參謀官依斯梅少將爲領袖云、（七日路透電）</p>

<p>柏林　德國官方頃對所傳德將侵荷之謠言、表示否認、謂德國並未計劃侵犯荷蘭、官方並稱、此項謠言自係荷蘭政府宣布特別防衛計劃及荷京與柏林間交通忽然遲緩二者而發生、而過去三日中、德宣傳活動所造成之一般緊張空氣、亦爲造謠者所憑之根據云（八日合衆）</p>

<p>荷京　軍事當局取銷官兵例假之後、現在假期中之官兵業已開始歸隊銷假、秩序至爲良好、全國鐵路交通均巳專供軍用、此次動員之軍隊、其員額之多將爲荷蘭有史以來所僅見、全國經濟生活自必受有影響、至於海軍方面所採之預防措置、以視陸軍尤爲積極、即商船水手及漁夫亦在徵召之列此外、荷蘭與外國之電話交通已受當局嚴格統制、並曾於昨日午後十時三十分至本日午前八時之間一度中斷、據商業匯報」發表社評稱、荷蘭國務須準備就緒、俾克應付任何事變、而於任何進期自由採取各項措置、荷蘭國無需外國援助、（哈瓦斯）</p>
<h3>比利時　有備無患</h3>
<p>白魯塞爾　關於荷蘭決定取消軍人請假以及交通斷絕之消息、傳至此間後、比利時全國均極表注意、但比國並不擬採取同樣措施、因比國自信其陸軍足以擊退侵略之敵軍、一般咸斷定日內即將有決定性之事件發生、特其發生之地點、各人猜測不同耳、（八日海通電）</p>

<h3>紙商　乘機抬價</h3>
<p>自此次本市黑匯波動後、一般投機商人、即乘機抬高物價、紙張價格、不斷飛漲、尤以白報紙價格、竟由每令三十餘元、漲至近五十元、故本市出版界甚感威脅、昨據紙業中人語平明社記者云、本市所用紙漲、除少數國產紙如毛邊紙等來自福建外、大部分咸來自德國及挪威、即本市造紙廠所製者、因紙　不能自製、不節不取給於外國、自外匯縮後、紙價之漲、亦理所當然、惟此次之突然漲價、則純屬投機者囤積及一部份紙商乘機抬高所致、　洋行方面定貨、近　續到滬、不絕於途、且定　係在月前之事、與此次黑匯波動根本無關、加之本市存紙、各洋棧中均滿坑滿谷、現市上所售、均屬舊貨、更無漲價之埋、乃日來各廠家各店號均以奇貨可居、對於購戶、規定每客戶限購白報紙、至多不得超過二令、似乎表示貨物缺乏、故意抬高貨價、奸商之心、誠不堪聞問、</p>

<h3>日鈔價值慘跌　日政府呈不安景象　滙市劇變日人自蒙其害　中傷法幣計畫毫無成效</h3>
<p>自二日滬上匯市發生劇擊後，日文報紙，述日大事渲染，對法幣價値，中傷構陷，無听不出其極，但據某經濟學者談，此種希望中國失敗之倖圖心理，實已忘情其本身之深陷泥淖。</p>
<p>事實證明謠言平息</p>
<p>（一）當局此次停止滬上黑市外匯供給，完全爲制止日方大量套匯權宜之計，不得不然；而投機者推波助瀾，有此現象，實非常局之所願。幸各方處以鎭靜，若千日後，風潮即已平息。（二）政府昨已電市商會及銀行公會，聲明對維持幣信及安定金融，具有決心，所有限制提存等等之謠言，皆係投機份子及奸人所造作。日方諫言，實已不攻自破。</p>
<p>日鈔低落影響輸出</p>
<p>目此次風潮之來，日鈔在華價格，亦隨之低落。致使日本國內工業需用之淪陷區物資，成本因而增加。製品售價，不能不爲之提高，實爲其對外輸出上之鉅大障碍，增大吸收外匯之困難。據本埠大陸新報東京支社電訊，日本財政常局，對此極抱憂　　正考慮對策，欲以原爲一日圓集團地區一物資輸入所設之資金，作爲調類之用；以期日本國內工業　品，不因淪陷區物來輸入之成本增加，引起物價之新的騰貴趨勢。但一般熟悉日本財政情形及該項資金內幕者觀察，日本財政常局此種考慮，固心有餘而力不足，勢難成爲事實，可見滙市劇變，已使日方　受其害，而證明中國此項政策之成功也。又日方對法幣滙　低落，大事誇張，謂係平凖基金枯竭之關係，大中社記者曾以此項傳說，叩詢金融界某要人，據稱：平凖基余係由英方匯豐，麥加利兩銀行合出五百萬鎊，中交兩行合出五百萬鎊而成。平凖會本爲牛官性質，對法幣外匯滙率過高則收買，通低由出售，以期市場穩定。吾人對「平準」二字，顧名思義，即可瞭然。</p>
<p>基金用罄類屬無稽</p>
<p>匯覺及麥加利之參加平準會，在披術上仍為商業性質，不過其資金由中英政府予以担保而已。故兩行於穩定外匯之中，仍不　營業之範圍，如去年秋間歐戰爆發，往時逃避之資金，大量流回上海，若非匯豐吃胃之健，則　　恐已一度昂達七八便士之譜，明乎平凖會之有進有出，可知基金用罄之說，純爲無稽之談。</p>
<p>本市日幣跌風尤勁</p>
<p>至日報所傳法幣將崩潰之說，見爲造謠中傷，設日人在開口以先，反躬目問其本身貨幣之價値，則小致信口雌黃如此。即以華北而論，在天津和界內「聯銀券」價値，仍低於法幣：如以「聯銀券」匯滬，須貼水二成左右，方可易法幣一百元。本市日鈔，不但隨同法幣下降，且其跌率，反較法幣爲甚。政府爲防止日僞套滙，及利用法幣向海外購買物資，不得不放任滙率，使其達自然之水準。若　人為之方法阻止，不由徒耗外匯基金，且無異以糧資日，日人之宜　，純爲顚倒因果。</p>

<p>一庭續審</p>
<p>訊據顧竹軒供稱、喬鄭一人事實上並非我門生、他們對我客氣、見面叫我一聲尤生、他們這般無智識的人、被捕後、無辜的將我一口咬得緊緊的、不知他們是什麽用意吳　倫與我是十多年的老朋友、　很喜歡唱戲、　邀伶人歡宴、均山吳任招待、我平時對人一切民　訟案、亦均係吳其倫辦，他平時除去爲辦案出庭之時間外、大的可以說別的地方他始終不去、最喜歡與我坐在</p>
<p>客廳間談</p>
<p>我與他的情感、可以說常住在上海的人、完全知這是十二分好沒有一點惡感、我何苦要胃犯法條敎唆人家殺害他呢、尙有一點、請庭上傳訊吳其倫兄長及其子到歲訊問、吳其倫的喪葬費完全是我的、他如果是我殺的、我還去管他這些閑事嗎、再講到我法相界的案子、吳　倫根本不是我的辯護人、他出力不出力、與我毫無關係、邱長蔭確認監護權一案、說邱家酬謝我三萬一千元調解費、未分給吳其倫、致惹吳在外破壞我名譽、這也是</p>

<h3>金融　外匯逐漸轉穩</h3>
<p>外匯昨日市况、匯豐掛脾、悉無上落、英美匯暗市、穩中帶硬、狀極平庸、乃經營者進出不一、投機性减少所致、至晨開又吿英平美緊、誠因匯兌繼續跌三分六二五、又見三元三角七分半空前低價、且聞一般空戶、尙不願抵補、故謂美鎊前途殊難逆料、本日買賣投機商、與外行相互供求、價遂於平中趨鬆、五月份美滙最賤爲四元五三一二五、投機商套利進現貨售出本月期、貼進美金一角二分半、以廿三天計算、息在三分半左右、迨收盤時止、市象缺乏變化、英金收盤三便士三四三七五、美匯四元六八七五、較上日收盤俱硬〇三一二五、論期貨與現貨愈形接近、</p>
<p>英美匯兌再跌晨初以倫敦大條、近遠俱跌〇六二五、紐約銀價仍平、倫敎生金呆定、滙兌英對美滬法等各匯均平、美對英繼續狂落三分六二五、對滬未更、對法降二分一二五、中央掛牌各匯如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金三便士三一二五、美滙四元六二五、較上日晚收英平美緊〇三一二五、此乃滙兌再猛縮之故、同時期貨開出、則吿美平英鬆、開後華商投機家尙有吸胃、惟外行供意不惡、故市面即現微硬、計外行塞予華商投機家五丹份美滙四元半、滙豐掛牌揭曉勿動、白銀平衡稅揭曉减徵五角、此後投機商曾復出五月份美滙價已爲四元五六二五、而外行售予華商現貨美滙時吿四元六八七五、且不久華行如上海等亦入市賣出、外行曾納進五月份美滙賤爲四元五三一二五、迨至午刻仍見平穩、結果收盤、英金三便士三四三七五、美滙四元六八七五、本月份英金三便士二五、美滙四元半、較隔昨收盤、現貨英美各鬆〇三一二五、本月份英金長〇九三七五、美滙硬〇六二五、午後週三無市、</p>
<p>香港滙市尚穩</p>
<p>香港八日（週三）電、今晨滙市開盤吿平、英滙現期貨仍開原盤、美滙現貨緊一八七五、爲二十元七五、遠期未開出、申匯現貨降五元、爲四百四十元、日匯現貨緊半元、爲八十九元、十時十分有趨　模樣、美匯現貨回長〇六二五、爲二十元八一二五、十一時三十分吿平、各匯概無變動、下午週三無市、</p>
<p>天津英美放長</p>
<p>天津八日（週三）電、今晨滙市開盤吿硬、因英匯現貨鬆〇七八一二五爲二便土九三七五、美匯現貨放長一二五、爲四元一二五、申匯微降二角五分、爲一百十三尤五角、聯鈔暗盤昂一元七角五分、爲一百〇一元、</p>
<h3>外幣漸起跌風</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市况、英美金鎊以蛤赤盤旋趨下、故供給較旺、市價各降三元、英金票以黑市英滙趨鬆、故亦下落五角、美金票‘始以鎊價續跌、晨初做二十一元二三角、但旋又因供給暢旺、而步隆至二十元零九角半、午爲二十一元一角、午後復退爲二十一元、比上日軋跌一角、香港票隨港滬滙兌而下落、法郞票仍不乏需要、市價略漲、新加坡及羅比坎拿大票等均屬供過於求、市價一致趨疲、日金票又趨低落、晚市爲一元二角七分五厘、朝鮮票忽有需要、市價挺漲、晚市爲一元零五厘、</p>
<h3>貼現低二十五元</h3>
<p>昨滙劃票據貼現率、步落益銳、每千元上午由一百七十元步跌至一百五十元、下午在一百四十五元左右、比前日再降二十五元、錢業公會拆息仍勿更、早午兩市均仍掛二角五分云、</p>
<h3>連漲七日之後　金市昨起反動　已跌進七千元大關</h3>
<p>昨日現金暗盤市况、以連漲七天、遽告反動、惟跌勢有限、乃多頭經營者尙肯努力維持、論市况極形平凡、買賣未現熱烈、亦因匯市轉穩、環境無刺激之故也、晨開吿小四十元、聞銀號金號供出後、錢兌業相與吐售、未幾破人七千元關內、一時賣出頭寸殊多、最低見九百五十元、嗣某銀號及證券帮錢兌業等見賤多頭吸收、得回升達七千〇五十元、奈散戶乘高忽作了結之舉、價又下降至六千九百八十元收盤、前因賴金號拉提、曾再稍回、惟銀號帮及錢兌業多頭吐出、故結果卒吿六千九百六十元收盤、較隔昨晚收軋跌一百元、午後塲外市勢稍轉、買戶肯照午收價再高十元收進、但尙缺乏供者、致鮮聞成交、半天交易由旺漸淸、的一千八百兩光景、銀樓飾金掛小十元、海關金等仍平、</p>
<p>烚赤回落百元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初開匯兌雖跌、但美滙略緊、旋即回硬、致人心未能激動、反之賣者頗多、開市即被撳小四十元、銀號出銀樓帮十兩、爲七千〇二十元、嗣曾稍定、但不久某錢兌業傾向吐出、兼某金號亦跟跡拋塞、而外匯斯時穩中帶硬、雖銀號帮及金號乘機吸收、但頭寸終感充斥、立步落七十元，錢兌業出銀樓帮十兩、遜爲六千九百九十元、旋某銀號乘低搜買、而賣戶已止塞觀望、頓見回起數十元、後再賴另一銀號追踪力扒、更加證券帮及錢兌業競向收買、續見回漲數十元、金號進銀號十兩、爲七千〇五十元、第因外滙仍吿鬆平、難免散戶趁高塞出、復又向下、錢兌業出金號二十兩、爲六千九百八十元、後金號前來拖入，重見回升二十元、金號互做三十兩、爲七千元、午刻卒因銀號幫及錢兌業多頭突來復出、再吿下游、銀號進銀樓幫及同業共二十兩、爲六千九百六十元作午收價、結果比上日回落一百元、半天百元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤較高數元、收進减低二十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十餘元、均鮮做開、</p>
<p>飾金掛小十元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、初時大同行仍懸七百二十元、迨至九時四十分掛小十元、此後無變化、計大同行改懸七百十元、新同行與上價相同、收進减低二十餘元光景、</p>
<h3>證券　內債忽又轉高　—橡皮股終於軟化—</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨日市況初疲後堅、上午交易極少、下午交易較多、市上傳言宋子文氏上檯之說、足以臨時刺激人心、致引起一般浮空之抵補、市况之忽浮忽沉、乃因金子之價稍疲外匯亦較鬆軟耳、昨日交易上午極稀、澗利稍有買進、益昌協大賣出、餘則散戶進出、午後德孚買進較多、久豐鴻康賣出、市價稍稍提高、結果回上一角至三角、成交的五十萬元左右、茲列簡表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交華成烟草公司股二十股、價爲四十五元正、</p>
<p>衆業股市之無色彩、殆因香賓大賽關係、雖祗半日營業、成交則尙不寂、開盤時趨勢略軟、買方吸胃殊淡、嗣因數種　名股有人乘低來進、價始轉堅、英聯股成交又鉅、徘徊於七十一二元間、除四海保險股外、其餘概較前收稍低、該股晨初　盤後、突騰踴至十九元七角新高價、收盤退去牛元、會德豐股亦回、除　股成交於一百十二至十八元間、新股權祇做八十五元、收盤前者素價一百二十一元、後者八十七元、</p>
<p>橡皮股事實上亦吿軟化、成交不鮮、價格跌落雖屬有限、各股俱難悻免、直言之、賣方壓力毫不尖銳、故對於一般廉價股票之獲取者、並不能認爲適宜之活動日也、</p>
<p>倫倫七日（週二）電、今日中國外債　英商遠東各司股票掛牌行市、概歸平定、行情均無上落、</p>
<h3>阿爾瑪股派息</h3>
<p>英商滙通洋行經理之阿爾嗎橡樹有限公司截至一九四〇年九月底止一年度之中期股息、每股國幣三元、定於五月二十二日開派、本年度中期股息、因英屬馬來亞政府實施滙兌統制規定股息分派、每年以中期及末决各一次爲限、第二次中期股息不再分派云、</p>
<h3>紗花　獲利出籠　紗市稍挫　雙馬回跌四十元</h3>
<p>紗市趨疲、且跌風稍起、此因連朝大漲之後、引起獲利者出籠、於是檯面鬆懈、反動尤烈、一般業外者吸收之額、始終不願放棄也、且歐洲局勢、尙在緊張中、以後原料恐生問題、拖進頗小乏人也、</p>
<p>現紗晨開氣勢稍平、因多頭了結、同時實需未旺、浮多吐出、二十支雙馬由一千六百六十五元、跌至一千六百四十七元、查半日間成交統計一千四百九十六包、行情廿支雙馬跌四十元、廠方由統一開出二三支金鷄一千包、價爲一千七百五十元、六七月期貸、今日有紗一百十二件運厦門、又九百四十五件運香港、茲將各帮口買去之額量、分形如左、</p>

<h3>外棉現貸　廉於期貸三四十元</h3>
<p>本棉交易尙堪維持、但執貨者鋻於歐洲　勢緊張、顧慮以後之船雙往返、發生阻碍而停駛、所以對於棉價看升、茲將現棉成交情形列左、</p>
<p>大中集　二九一·〇〇</p>

<p>彭家浦　三〇七·五〇　三〇八·〇〇　同行進　五〇〇件</p>
<p>白洛去　三〇三·〇〇　同行進　一〇〇件</p>
<p>另訊外棉市價、紐約棉市昨日頗呈疲乏之狀、因現貨商之拋賣及海外棉商之賣出結果、收盤價格較之上日跌落五六磅音、印度昨日停市埃及跌二十餘磅音、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、日來較形活躍、但限於現貨交易、蓋因現貨之售價、未如滙兌價然、其價尙未漲足、較之期貨可廉去三四十元、奈因銀根奇緊、交易數額並非鼎盛也、茲將昨日棉市以美滙四元六二五折合送廠價如下、</p>
<p>二十支　美米特林　三七五·九〇</p>
<p>二十支　又　下級三六〇·七〇</p>

<p>四十二支　又　下級三八五·六〇</p>
<p>印棉又有到滬、裝英輪蘇旦號約五千件、自孟買裝來、原定昨日下午到滬、但至下午六時許尙無消息、的昨晚或今晨定可到埠、停靠浦東其昌棧起卸、</p>
<h3>疋頭　布疋手貸　賣出漸旺</h3>
<p>布市以實銷呆滯、銀根緊迫、執貸者傾向賣出、故市價漸吿不支、步步下落、結果細布·細斜每疋跌一元左右、粗布跌二角半至五角、粗斜以一向市價壓小、近則實銷頗活動、是以便獨堅定、本街成交粗斜·粗布二百餘包、細布·細斜一百餘包、色布·漂布·府綢·蔴紗·花布一萬數千疋、粵帮辦嗶嘰府綢·蔴紗等貨一百數十件、浙路溫甬台帮辦粗布、花絨等深色貨一百餘件、淺色貨採辦大稀、</p>
<p>東布昨因本客實銷仍疲、跌風轉盛、龍頭細布最小　後市跌至每疋四十八元五角、收盤稍見回升至四十九元七角半、四君子嗶嘰低盤亦曾降至現貨每碼一元四角叫分二五、嗣以同業搜羅、收盤爲一元四角五分半、</p>
<p>出口疋頭九日運廈門一百七十件、運香港一千零三十件、運海防七百零五件、</p>
<h3>糧食　到湧銷細　洋米一路直下　粳糯亦見回隆</h3>
<p>米市昨則　風更熾、實胃不動、投機者頓失　藉、况此次米價騰貴、全係投機作用、市面一旦挫折、逐均賣餒意懈、亟亟爭售、致昔之互相轟激變爲各自貶脫、在此種環境之下、一路直瀉、若小紋自早市初開即落半元、爲四十八元半、後則節節下游至四十七元半、惟此價方出、補空迭起、俄又回至四十八元、後則時起時伏、盤旋於三五角之間、卒以四十七元八角收盤、較之前市收價四十九元、續降一元二三角，惟其他如西實等各貨價、經此小絞更番跌仆、雖亦相牽引低、參差互見、然市綫漸入準則、巳不若前之混淆、優劣亦較能分淸焉、計一號西貢收價仍爲五十元至四十九元半、二號四十八元半至四十八元、一號暹羅四十九元半至四十九元、二號四十八元至四十七元半、火絞四十九元三角至四十八元七角、東京砶尖四十七元半至四十七元、而混合碎與米茶仍以貨稀、獨能不受影響、站守原盤、</p>
<p>厚薄粳國米、到貨雖仍有限、然傳聞塲外暗盤因備遭洋米牽制、繼難立足、做開旣寥、售盤步落元外、無錫淸特粳巳入五十元大關、爲四十九元半至四十九元、粉粳四十八元半至四十八元、常崑粳四十八九元、宿熱者四十六七元、靑泗特別薄稻四十九元、大市四十七八元、南港早稻高自四十七元半、次至四十六元、</p>
<p>糯米去路本滯、到貸擁擠、一般貸主又恐遭遇大　、遂均不惜身本、猛甩求脫、致行情銳跌二元有奇、溧陽特元祗售四十元零五角至四十元、常丹市元三十八元半至三十八元、次如潮柔者僅四十七元左右矣、</p>
<p>洋米連日趨平後、行情一直下游、投機幫因其市價旣少週旋局勢、興味漸淡、而零囤散戶之獲利者莫不急於求脫、而實銷史呆、市乃繼續趨跌、昨日上午洋米現貨盡小元外、午後續小數角至近元、小紋出入較旺、上午開價仍有四十八元三五角、午市小至四十七元三五角、下午一度小至四十六元許、惟大戶尙不肯賤脫、五月上期二號西貢亦自四十九元二角降至四十八元八九角、但囤戶較貪、跌風比現米爲緩、全日開出現米五千包、期貨四百噸、父訊、洋米昨日到滬六千七百餘包、計怡和洋行永生輪昨展到埠、自香港運來洋米七百二十三包、又太古公司濟南輪昨日中午抵滬、亦由香港裝來洋米六千零三十九包、兩輪昨已分別起卸、</p>
<h3>粉市間散　運廈門五萬餘包</h3>
<p>粉市轉平、全日交易、殊形間散本街方面、因廠盤已達十四元、門市零銷不振、故進胃怠懈、客帮去化、雖有點級、亦乏開展之望、兼之米價步降、人心未免鬆弛、回籠粉老車牌擯持乏交、祇內地日廠粉略有新交易、計開山鹿牌十四元二角、及鳳凰牌轉棧貨十三元九角、市面殊風平庸、全市各粉成交、併計約有五六千包、小麥無市、</p>
<p>九日出口至廈門五萬零三百包、明日運往天津四萬包、</p>
<h3>油市　生油進口為多　生仁豆子有出口</h3>
<p>昨日天津來生油一千八百四十四聽、烟台來一千聽、九日出口至厦門、豆子一千五百三十五包、又往香港一千七百包、及生仁一千三百五十包、生油運香港五百聽、運厦門三百聽、</p>
<h3>糖市　糖價銷形回小　—進出口亦不少—</h3>
<p>昨糖市以外匯見長、趨勢略鬆、公會劃盤二四粗白、本棧七十六元三角、小四　、外棧新貨七十六元、老貨七十五元八角至六角、計小五六角、轉口貨五月底交割成交五百包、五十九元八角、降二角、太古車白B嘜西棧八十六元半、小半元、HX嘜八十五元、　H嘜事赤乃爲六十三元、荷赤外棧六十六元半、轉口五十五元半、本廠特白七十六元、小五角、本冰九十元牛、晶明冰九十二元、均未更動、到糖昨由濟南輪運到刁靑六百十包、車白二百包廣州灣邋來白糖四百二十五包、海口來赤白共計一千一百十四包、片糖一百二十五包、九日運往厦鬥糖一百五十包、十日運往靑島三千包、</p>
<h3>呢絨　白直貢缺貸</h3>
<p>白直貢呢市貨頗缺、申地紡織品、因非　　　能　合、　　品極鮮、巴成供不數　之　、　準行情、突又躍漲、昨二二二　牌白直　呢、　批現交已售　三十五元、體和二十八元、東貨頭號售二十三四元、普通二十元左右、中　本廠貨怡和·宏康·永興諸牌大半齊沽十七八元、西服帮因暑期所必需、大有開進云、</p>
<h3>五金　本廠釘達八十元關</h3>
<p>本廠釘市面、隨外匯緊縮、遂吿飛黃騰達、而其去路如本街建築帮及津烟靑諸客商、銷胃俱形呆滯、市象因之蕭條、至前昨外匯趨平所以各貨市面亦定、本廠釘常亦不能例外、致本街之諸銷路隨見稍動、但其價已近八十元大關、較前劇昂達二十元光景、</p>
<h3>絲茶　絲價前途仍堅　人造絲陸續到滬</h3>
<p>絲經　昨日美絲市微有升降、紐的近期漲三分、遠期跌四分、橫濱現貨漲十元、遠期小十一元、洋行絲交昨頗活躍、輯里白雪牌售三千元曁正副牌輯里共成交五十擔、白頭洋行千金絲做開二十擔、價二千元、絲價前途在堅平過程中、</p>
<p>人絲　東貨近多數由香港來滬、以充洋貨、昨日永生輪又自香港運來二百六十六包、聞意國貨人造絲今日亦有到滬、的一千包、裝意郵船康脫羅棱號運來、的今日下午三時左右可進口、停靠虹口順泰碼頭起卸、</p>
<p>新茶　續有做開、全市共由錦隆同孚等行、購進珍眉綠茶七十餘箱、抽珍售價五百七十五元、統珍售價四十六七元、售盤無甚上落、現華商均以內地毛茶價貴、對此市面粉電停止進貨、昨由香港來茶葉三千三百五十四件、今日運厦門一百二十四件、香港二百四十件、</p>
<h3>無錫桑葉高漲　—春蠶已屆二眠—</h3>
<p>無錫本屆春蠶四鄉育戶之盛、實開未有之紀錄、日來天時和暖、發育甚速、經過亦佳、現已二眠、惟桑葉求過於供、由二十元三擔起、價已漲至四十元三擔、因百物步漲、人心一致看高也、（良）</p>
<h3>四月份生絲輸美　較為減少行市堅定</h3>
<p>四月份紐的生絲、進銷與前月無甚軒輊、計進口减一二八五祖、銷用增五五担、存底則减去三一八九担、故月初絲市頗呈堅平也、茲摘錄統計如下、</p>
<p>本月紐約生絲進口、預料將更减少、蓋目下生絲輸美在途計爲一一·〇〇〇担、較前月少二二〇〇担、較前年同月减一四八〇〇担、計减百分之五〇强云、</p>

<h3>迎春禮（三）</h3>
<p>儀仗中有德政牌三十餘對，萬民傘一十七頂，紅羅金繡，輝煌奪目，望之如五色雲霞，結成華蓋，從天半　艷而至；蓋邑尊嚴辦地棍，杭民感德，皆各鄉里陸續公獻也。又見靑旗載道，金鑼震天，一切令旗令箭戈鋌棍棒門槍坐旂執戈列戰之屬，結隊而過者四十餘人，皂班數十名，各黑衣黑帽，頭揷鵝毛，或肩負皮鞭，或手携鐵鍊，更有竹節巨板，彩漆軍棍，皆拖曳而行，手銬胸棍，鐐如鎖鍊，其琅璫之聲，聞者　堪膽懾，是時道旁觀者不下千百人，皆靜視無　。兩縣過後，則　太守之鹵簿，已夾道相接。群守職位較尊，騶從更形繁盛，前導執事以及慈政牌萬民傘等，大略相同，若門槍令牌令箭籤筒刑杖，以及樂人鼓吏，掌號引喤等，皆騎行，非若縣中之徒步也，中更間親兵數十人，號褂鮮明，軍械鋒利，尤稱威武，後有馬隊如雲，齊驅並駕者，則即呼房之書吏也，太尊則端坐輿中，威儀棣棣，其氣象與三分府兩知縣，逈不侔矣。</p>

<p>科學</p>
<h3>科學的利與害</h3>
<p>— 節流</p>
<p>法國都洛大學講師更傑最近著作一書，名叫『機械與哲學』，書中對於工業的進步，評論綦詳，現在將　書中所述的要旨，擇要介紹於讀者。</p>
<p>古代沒有復什的機械，其原因約有兩端：</p>
<p>（一）思特一切科學尙在幼稚的階段，是以古人不能將科學的原理，應用於工業方面。</p>
<p>（二）古代的經濟制度，基礎於奴隸制度上面。現代英國作家赫胥黎也謂：『古時希臘的經濟制度，實肇基於奴隸制度上面，所以當時毋需運用科學的原理，以改良工業。』</p>
<p>作者寫道：道是古人的舛誤，沂數世紀以來，哲學上的各項問題，始終未曾解決，而工業則突飛猛晋，已將整個世界，完全改觀了。我們應該利用最近發明的學理，再行設法硏求其他的眞理，以期改良人類生活的條件；或者創設一種科學，務求能使人類的工作减輕。』</p>
<p>可是近世工業的發達，反而造成了另一錯誤。在一七九〇年前後，英國的機械化，迅速地普遍全國，工人們感受打擊，大都慘擁失，而陷於飢寒交迫的境地。至一八一五年，工人階級的失業，其主因皆爲生產物品太多，無處傾銷。推究其故，並不是機械太精良的結果所致，乃是生產物分配太不均勻的綠故………工人們每日縫織許多襯衫，這些襯衫均陳列在工廠中，雖然堆積如山，然而　於工人們自己毫無益處，他們反而赤裸着身體，豈非笑話？</p>
<p>所以我們的錯誤，是在不知如何管理精良上業的生產，如何分配生產的物品。至於工人失　的痛苦等，與工業發展改良的本身，並無關係。</p>
<p>不過我們須將科　與工業二者分別淸楚。科學僅是一種思想，　俟應用之於實際方面，便不再是科學了。因此有許多人士，均將戰爭的殘酷，歸咎於科學的進步，其理解實屬謬誤。因爲科學的本身，並無所謂善恶，惟有科學的應用，方始或爲人類謀求幸福，或爲殺人的利器。所以飛機可以裝載病人，也可携帶炸彈，其本身無分善惡，爲益爲害，須視其如何被人利用而定。</p>
<p>所以，科學的利與害，是人爲的，這是一個用法的問題，說得遠。一點，可以說是一個制度問題。</p>
<p>雜感</p>
<h3>小蟋蟀</h3>
<p>— 公西草</p>
<p>着了五彩卡通片木偶奇遇記（Pinochio），回來以後，影片上那個小蟋蟀一直在我心上跳上跳下，跳得我不禁想講幾句話。</p>
<p>小蟋蟀是木偶　諾丘的良心，他要使他勇敢，誠實，不自私：幫助他變成一個眞小孩</p>
<p>狐狸和貓把比諾丘誘惑到邪路上去。第一次他們用名譽一作香餌，把他賣給木偶戲的主人，然而小蟋蟀使他悔悟得救了。第二次他們用快樂島上的快樂生活打動了他的心，跑去快樂了一塲的結巢，長揚一對驢耳朶，一條驢尾巴。假如不是小蟋蟀帶他逃出了虎口，誰知道接着來的會是什麽命運？</p>
<p>比諾丘回家了，不見了父親。愛父親的心使他不怕一切的困難，小蟋蟀便陪着他到海底鯨魚的肚子裏，我到他的父親。後來爲了救父親，木偶的比諾丘死了，但是在父親淚眼前，却出現了另一個比諾丘，——一個眞小孩。</p>
<p>小蟋蟀盡了他良心的職務，所以藍衣仙女替他配上金質的徽章。</p>
<p>這當然是部童話，可是他無意中擊中了中國今日的某些人。</p>
<p>人的良心，當然不會獨立生存在體外：然而人的良心有時却很可能跑出體外，飛得無影無蹤。那時「誘惑」正在施展着大本領。</p>
<p>今日中國正有着一些　比諾丘的木偶，替主人賣力氣，全然不顧晚上回去，是鎖在籠課的命運；今日中國也正有一些人，做着快樂島的幻夢，把那芷遭鯨呑的老父，忘記得乾乾凈凈。全然不管「快樂」以後是否還有自由來作人。</p>
<p>這些都是喪心之徒，他們的小蟋蟀業已不知去向了，不知何日才能飛回來？</p>
<p>希望「比諾丘」在演戲與做快樂的夢之餘，也能有機會去看一下「木偶奇遇記」。——童話　管是童話，成人們也很能看到些東西。因為　管已是成人，沒有良心便不成其爲人了</p>
<h3>世界運動會何嘗停辦？</h3>
<h3>時乎不再</h3>
<p>— 柳嘉淦譯富蘭克林原著</p>
<p>假使時間是一切東西的最寳貴者，那末消耗時間必定是一個極巨大的浪費，因爲失去的時間是決不再回的了；我們常常說我們的時間多得很，但事實證明却時間總是不够。</p>
<p>讓我們奮起，有目的的做去吧：由於我們的勤勉，我們將毫無困難的去做更多的事情</p>
<p>懶惰使一切事情都感到困難，除非他勤勞，方才可使一切轉難爲易。</p>
<p>遲起的人必須忙碌終日而猶難得在晚上去完威他的事務；懶惰的人貧窮會立刻抓住他</p>
<p>去幹你底事業吧，不要讓事業來推動你；早起早陲，使成一個康健，富裕和聰慧的人。</p>
<p>敎育</p>
<h3>羅素與性道德</h3>
<p>— 溫和</p>
<p>五月七日本報敎育消息　刊戰一條『美國敎靑界發生軒然大波』的消息，讀者諸君想都看到了。這是講『羅素被法院判決，不准在紐約學院授課一的事，關於這伴事，其中因果詳情還有不少在那天報上沒有講到的，這裏可以補光一下</p>
<p>這次「軒然大波」的掀動人是紐的主敎孟寗（Mann　ng）氏，孟氏因羅素將在紐約州立大學授課，特在各報發表公開函，攻擊羅素。函中頂兇的一點，是關於羅素『通姦』的事。因爲羅素已三易其妻，他的第一妻阿麗斯（Alys　Pearshall）於一九二一年同他離婚，理由是羅素同另一個女子叫挑拉（Dora　Winfred　Black）的姘識，桃拉那時即將生育了。離婚後，桃拉做了藉素的正式夫人，一九三三年她宣布已經同新聞記者巴栗（GriffinBany)生了一個孩子了。同時羅素似乎也在外面拈花惹草，反而給桃拉控告他通姦之罪，於一九三五年同他離婚。一九三六年，那時羅素已六—多歲了，他再同他以前的女秘書巴屈麗四（PatrciaHelen　Spence）結婚，直到現在。羅素　經發表過關於通姦的　見，認爲此事不値得大驚小怪，所以給孟寗主敎討住了，把他痛斥一頓。</p>
<p>立刻赫斯特系各報都響應孟主敎，列舉羅維素四大罪狀：（一）反宗敎；（二）不道德，（三）過激派：（四）異邦：有此四大罪狀，所以他不配到紐約來敎書。其他各敎會團體如天主敎，路德教，浸禮會等也紛起聲討羅素。</p>
<p>在另一方面，美國各名敎授及許多大學的校長都起來替羅素辯護。紐約市立學院哲學敎授柯亨（M.R.Cohen）　道：『在羅素素所講學過的各大學中，從來沒有一個家長和敎員，或是學校當局說過羅素有什麼不道德的影響的。』這句話深得學生擁護。市立學院的代理院長米特（N.P.Mead）氏也說：『我們是請他來敎哲學和邏輯…，不是來討論私人的道德觀念的。』</p>
<p>紐約市的　議會和高等敎育委員會、也先後開會，討論此事。最後才有市民凱夫人（Mrs.Jean　Kay）以納稅人的資格去請法院解除羅素的聘約，因爲他的女兒即將入紐約學院，她不願看見她的女兒受到羅素的惡影響，所以才來起訴。她的律師帶了四本羅素所做的書：「我信甚麽」（What　I　Believe,）「婚姻與道德」（Marriage　　　Morals），『敎育與善良生活』（Good　Life　Edneation＆　The）『教育與近代世界』（Educa　tion　＆　Moden　World），這四本書裏羅素都贊成自由性父，放棄婚姻束縛。這種思想對於現代社會，當然有相當的危險性，所以法院爲了尊重民　起見，接受她的接求，不准羅素在紐的市立學院講學。</p>
<p>凱夫人得知宣判後，說道：『正義和淸白勝利了，我很快活。在這次大鬥爭中，我是一種象徵。……我相信世上的母親們都有自己的哲學，這種哲學不但。以同大哲人的相匹敵，而且在許多點上，反而勝過他們的呢。』</p>
<p>羅素現在還在加利福尼亞大學敎書，他曉得了這件事，大爲驚詫，他說：『這是給我的大打擊。我不知怎麽說才好。我要大家知道：我並不想道個位置。…我不像孟寗主敎，我不像他那樣的對於性問題發牛興趣。』云。</p>

<p>㳺藝界</p>
<h3>行都游藝界近狀</h3>
<p>— 小齊</p>
<p>行都重慶的娛樂事業，現在呈現着空前的活躣，一共有四家華貴的電影院，二個川劇塲，一個楚劇塲，二個平劇院，一個大鼓書院，一個山東劇院。</p>
<p>電影院時常開映些「盧宮秘史」「百寳圖」之類的軟性片：「木蘭從軍」的開映，給觀衆以很大的變動，結果激起了怒潮，鬧出一塲「焚片」的糾紛，在重慶電影界方面，發生了個極大的波瀾。中國電影廠，爲了適應這種市塲上急迫的需要起見，近來正加工趕製，同時有「塞上風雲」，「日本閒諜」，「白雲故鄉」，「東亞之光」，「作家封禾子（風子）在「白雲故鄉」裏擔任主角；外舒繡文·白楊·高占非等第一流藝人，都非常的活躍。</p>
<p>文化人努力的結果，各種話劇團體如雨後春筍般成立起來，成功的劇本，也頗有可觀。像凌鶴編導的「金姑娘」，國立戲劇學校的「岳飛」和「蛻變」（曹禺編導）中國萬歲劇團的「國家空上」（老舍宋之的合編馬彥祥導演）復旦劇社（洪深馬彥祥等編導的「夜上海」，都有良好的收穫。最近因章泯賀孟斧沙蒙等劃人，都先後到重慶，「業餘」又有復活的可能；宋之的爲「業餘」寫的新劇本「霧重一慶」不久就可以正式上演，風雲際會，重慶的劇運，可以說得上是白熱化了。</p>
<p>因爲通俗文藝作家老向和游藝界聯成一氣，所以作家寫好他們拿去登臺就唱，從滑稽大鼓到山東犬鼓以及相聲之類，不時有應時即景的新唱篇可以聽到，深入民間，發生的影響最大。川劇楚劇，因方言的限制，只有土著川人愛聽這種本地風光的地方戲，外省人除了偶或去瞧個熱鬧外，平常是不大會有人去的：就是平劇，也因爲路遠同費用過於浩大的關係，始終還沒有北平上海方面的紅角兒乘漏過臉，這却不能不說是一種缺憾了！</p>
<h3>露薏絲蕾娜談　演劇秘訣</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>「請你講些演劇的秘訣吧。蕾娜小姐！」有人這樣的請求曾獲二度金像獎的露薏絲蕾娜。</p>
<p>她說：『抱款的很，我並沒有演戲的秘訣，不過我以爲演　者必須不斷地「學習」。在我未到好萊塢以前，未　學過英語，但現在已能琅琅上口了，這可說是努力學習的結果吧！由此觀之，只要你勤一學習一，終有成功的一天。這就算是演劇的秘訣吧！』</p>
<p>她又說：「我對於每日所習見的事物，都不肯輕易的放過，仔細的硏究牠，倣摹牠，然後拿所得在銀幕上表演出來。有人以為我有過人的智慧，但是他們不知道我是從「學習」得來的」。</p>
<p>那個人　　的問題：一小姐！你對於二度獲獎，有什麼感想？』</p>
<p>她回答說：『我固然爲得獎而快樂，但也不敢自滿。我以爲金像獎者，是指演員有若干成功的表示，其價値等於「里程碑」。擙句話說：「就是你飾某一角色，已獲成功，以後仍得努力邁進。絕對不是說，你獲得金像獎後，你的演技，已達到止境了」。</p>
<p>露薏絲蕾娜的演技，確乎達到神妙的境地了，但是她仍是虛懷若谷。奉　國產片的演員，努力地學學她的「學習」的精神吧！</p>
<h3>高爾基影片　風行蘇聯</h3>
<p>（塔期社莫斯科電）蘇聯電影院現正放映「余之大學」一片。該片係叙述大作家高蘭基少年時代堅苦奮鬬之情形。高爾基抵卡柴後，原擬就學，但因　空如洗，無法達其目的。高氏乃在河邊麺包店中設立臨時大學」，悉心硏究，全片描爲高氏最黑暗時期之生活，暗示靑年應如個在惡劣環境中舊鬬。</p>

<h3>The Besieged Japanese Troops in Southern Henan Attempt to Break Through in Small Groups Without Success; Remnants of Japanese Troops Near Tanghe Are Defeated in a Pincer Attack; Japanese Troops Surrounded by Chinese Forces in the Suizao Mountain Area of Northern Hubei</h3>
<p>Nanyang (Eighth Dispatch) News received here in Chongqing today indicates that Japanese troops, who had advanced northwest along the Nanyang-Tongbai-Xinyang highway and the Nanyang-Biyang-Queshan highway, had their main force surrounded and attacked by the Chinese army in the area east of Biyang and Tongbai. Unable to move, they are gradually being eliminated. As of yesterday afternoon, the Japanese situation was increasingly unsustainable, and they split into small groups to break out to the northwest. One group of more than two thousand had advanced to the vicinity of Tanghe, but after a pincer attack by the Chinese army, these Japanese troops were completely dispersed by dusk. The remnants fled west towards the northwest and north of Tanghe that evening.</p>
<p>Fancheng (Eighth Dispatch) The Japanese, lingering near Suixian, advanced towards Tangxianzhen (northwest of Suixian) yesterday, where they were met with resistance from a Chinese unit, which inflicted heavy casualties. The Japanese then reinforced their counterattack, advancing with over two hundred tanks from both flanks. The Chinese army destroyed thirty-one Japanese tanks and inflicted countless casualties on the Japanese troops. Fierce fighting continued into the night.</p>
<p>Changsha (Eighth Dispatch) On the 5th, a Chinese unit attacked Zhangjiaji and Jiangjiadian. By noon, the Japanese abandoned five hundred corpses and retreated, and both locations were declared retaken.</p>
<p>Pingjiang (Seventh Dispatch) Japanese troops from Yangxin, southern Hubei, engaged in a melee with a Chinese unit in the area south of Yangxin on the evening of the 6th. The Japanese army, unable to withstand the pressure, retreated north.</p>
<p>Fancheng (Seventh Dispatch) Due to fierce Chinese resistance and skillful planning, the war situation in southern Henan, northern Hubei, and central Hubei has become increasingly favorable to China. Japanese troops advancing north from Zhongxiang, with an advance force of over a thousand men, were ambushed on the 7th at Huanglongdang, sixty li southwest of Zao yang, by a surprise attack from three sides: left, right, and front. More than five hundred were killed or wounded. The following force of four to five thousand men, after passing Changshoudian, northwest of Zhongxiang, had their retreat cut off by Chinese forces. Another group of more than three thousand Japanese troops, attacking Tianjiaji, southwest of Zao yang, is still being annihilated by Chinese forces. On the main front of the Xianghua Road, Chinese and Japanese forces are still fighting near Tangxianzhen, east of Zao yang. Although the Japanese attacked with more than fifty tanks, they failed to break through the Chinese lines. On the southern Henan front, the Japanese used a division-sized force to attack fiercely westward from Xichuan, but after suffering a heavy blow from a Chinese flanking attack, further westward expansion has become impossible. Fierce fighting continues near Tongbai. In short, the Japanese on all three fronts have been frustrated.</p>
<p>North of Yangzi: Fierce Fighting Unfolds</p>
<p>Fancheng (Seventh Dispatch) In the recent days, the Chinese army in central Hubei has achieved numerous victories in the area south of Tianjiaji and north of Yangzi. After defeating over a thousand Japanese troops at Zhangjiaji, the Chinese captured a large amount of abandoned Japanese military supplies. After defeating the Japanese army at Gongjia Bridge, a Chinese unit continued to pursue north and defeated several hundred Japanese troops near Chenjiadawan. When over two thousand Japanese troops from Tianjiaji arrived as reinforcements, Chinese reinforcements also arrived, and fierce fighting unfolded south of Tianjiaji. Another Chinese unit crossed Tianjiaji and is advancing towards Xinjie and Huanglongdang.</p>
<p>Fancheng (Seventh Dispatch) On the 5th, a Chinese unit engaged in fierce fighting with Japanese troops north of Liushuigou for an entire day. The Japanese launched several fierce attacks and twice released poison gas, but were repelled by the Chinese. The Japanese suffered extremely heavy casualties in this battle. Two thousand Japanese troops attacking the area of Gengjiaji, Banchenggang, and Xinshui were blocked by the Chinese, suffering countless casualties.</p>
<p>Yichang (Seventh Dispatch) The Japanese troops who previously advanced north of the Fengle River have already been defeated by the Chinese. Another group of over three thousand Japanese troops advanced to the Tianjiaji area and were subjected to a pincer attack by the Chinese, who had circled behind them from Liushuigou and other locations. The Japanese suffered over a thousand casualties. The Chinese are currently in the process of annihilating the main Japanese force in the southeast area of Liushuigou.</p>
<h3>Japanese Heavily Defeated South of Jincheng; Chinese Army Recaptures Dongfeng Town; Briefly Enters Tianjing Pass; Remnants of Japanese Troops on Zhangmao Avenue Retreat to Jiexian</h3>
<p>Xingji (Seventh Dispatch) Japanese troops south of the Dongfeng-Yangcheng Avenue were completely driven back by the Chinese on the 4th. Taking advantage of the victory, the Chinese captured Dongfeng Town and advanced out of the Dongfeng Southeast Avenue, continuing to pursue towards Yangcheng and Shangwocun in the direction of Zhangma.</p>
<p>Ling (Eighth Dispatch) Japanese troops near Jincheng have suffered extraordinarily heavy casualties after repeated attacks by the Chinese. Tianjing Pass was briefly stormed by Chinese forces, resulting in numerous Japanese deaths. At Tianshuiling, Xinfanggou, and other locations, the Japanese were ambushed by Chinese forces after being surrounded. Lichuan and Yedi have both been recaptured by the Chinese.</p>
<p>Tongguan (Eighth Dispatch) Japanese troops in the areas of Zhangdianzhen, Dakuan, Bamei, and Dazhengcun on Zhangmao Avenue in southern Shanxi, after being defeated by the Chinese, fled north. They were pursued by the Chinese in the areas of Yukou and Duncun. A portion of the troops retreated towards Jiexian.</p>
<p>Shaanzhou (Eighth Dispatch) More than three thousand Japanese troops in the area south of the Dongfeng Avenue in southern Shanxi were defeated by the Chinese on the 4th, leaving behind more than five hundred corpses. They fled northeast in different directions. On the morning of the 5th, the remnants were severely attacked by the Chinese in the mountainous area near Chenjiazhuang, resulting in more than four hundred Japanese deaths. The remnants are currently trapped within an encirclement.</p>
<p>Luoyang (Seventh Dispatch) Fierce fighting between Chinese and Japanese forces continues outside Jincheng. On the 2nd, the Chinese attacked Japanese troops in the Tianjing Pass-Tianshuicen (south of Jincheng) area and encountered the Japanese at Dongxifengtou (west of Tianjing Pass), resulting in fierce fighting.</p>
<p>Xingji (Seventh Dispatch) On the 3rd, the Chinese army attacked Nancun (southeast of Zhangdian). On the 4th and 5th, a portion of the Japanese army launched another fierce attack towards Nancun, southeast of Zhangdian. The Chinese army defeated the Japanese. A portion of the Japanese army, numbering over a thousand men, retreated to Xianwengshan, Zhongshanling, Zishayao, and other locations east of Qinshui, near Duanshi Town (west of Gaoping). Since the 5th, the main Chinese force has continued to launch fierce attacks in different directions to the north and south of Gaoping and near Jincheng.</p>
<p>Luoyang (Seventh Dispatch) Over four thousand Japanese troops near Jincheng launched an offensive to the southwest starting on the 1st, advancing to the vicinity of Dongcun, where they were subjected to a fierce flanking attack by the Chinese army. A fierce battle ensued for three days and three nights, with thirteen bayonet charges. Starting on the 4th, the Chinese launched a full-scale offensive, and the Japanese troops south of the Rongcun Avenue were the first to retreat.</p>
<h3>Japanese Ammunition Depot Near Jinan Explodes and Burns Down</h3>
<p>Somewhere in Shandong (Eighth Dispatch) Southwest of the Japanese camp in Xinzhuang, Jinan, the Japanese had established a North China military supplies storage depot, containing a large amount of military supplies. On April 11th, a large batch of ammunition was transported from Tianjin, totaling forty-seven trucks, all of which were stored in the depot. On April 29th, the Japanese Emperor's birthday, courageous Chinese soldiers disguised themselves and infiltrated the depot, using explosives to destroy the ammunition depot. An immediate and thunderous explosion occurred, shaking the entire city. The fire burned for several hours, and all Japanese ammunition and military supplies were reduced to ashes, resulting in extremely heavy losses.</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting Occurs Near Baoding and Shijiazhuang</h3>
<p>Hong Kong (Eighth Dispatch) News from Tianjin indicates that fierce fighting has unfolded between Chinese and Japanese forces near Baoding and Shijiazhuang in Hebei province.</p>
<h3>Members of the Japanese Anti-War League Arrive in Guilin from the Occupied Territories</h3>
<p>Chongqing (Eighth Dispatch) The Southwest Branch Patrol Work Group of the Japanese People's Anti-War League in China, consisting of seventeen members including Sakamoto Hideo, together with Lin Changyong, director of the Guilin Headquarters General Advisor's Office, and a group of forty-three people in total, arrived in Chongqing at noon on the 8th. Over two thousand representatives from various mass organizations in the wartime capital gathered at the pier to welcome them. A welcoming address was delivered by the general representative, Yin Baoyu, followed by an expression of gratitude from Kaji Wataru, a representative of the Japanese Anti-War League. Sakamoto Hideo then reported in detail on the establishment of the group and its work in southern Guangxi. The greeters then led them to their lodgings. The group members sang anti-Japanese war songs along the way, and the masses applauded in welcome, creating an extremely enthusiastic atmosphere.</p>
<p>Chongqing (Eighth Dispatch) Official sources report that forty-four Japanese prisoners of war, including two women, have recently arrived here from Guilin. All of the prisoners have undergone twelve months of political training and have been released to organize anti-war propaganda teams. These Japanese are wearing grass-green Chinese uniforms and are walking the streets of Chongqing. The authorities have also allowed them to visit shops and attend theatrical performances, according to the Associated Press.</p>
<h3>An Underground Hospital in Xi'an</h3>
<p>Chongqing (Eighth Dispatch) There is a peculiar hospital in Xi'an, the capital of Shaanxi province, unlike any other in the world. The hospital is located in a thirty-foot-deep underground cave in the backyard of a certain Taoist temple, to protect it from Japanese bombing. Thirteen of the caves are used as wards, accommodating hundreds of beds, and the remaining ten caves are used as treatment rooms and staff dormitories. The hospital has twenty-one doctors, most of whom studied in England and the United States, and treats five hundred patients every day. The caves are quite dry and well-ventilated, according to Reuters.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Administrative Council Sends Telegram of Respect to Chiang</h3>
<p>Shaoguan (Seventh Dispatch) The Guangdong Provincial Government convened an administrative meeting on the 3rd of this month, attended by senior officials from various departments, administrative commissioners from various districts, and magistrates from various counties.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>A Perspective on Japanese Diplomacy</h3>
<p>Examining the diplomacy of various countries in recent years, the most seemingly active yet actually confused, the most seemingly adept at expediency yet actually the most aimless, the most seemingly opportunistic yet actually ending up with nothing, the most seemingly capable of exploiting others and seizing opportunities yet actually ending up deceiving and harming itself – the two countries that stand out above all others are: Poland and Japan.</p>
<p>Poland relied heavily on the German-Italian axis while also engaging with the British-French group. In the near term, it took advantage of Czechoslovakia and Lithuania, seizing opportunities during times of trouble. From afar, it brazenly recognized the so-called "Manchukuo" to curry favor with Japan. While calling for anti-aggression, it also aspired to join the ranks of powerful countries capable of aggression. Now, not only has it acted contrary to its own principles, but its territory has been returned, and its entire nation has fallen under the control of the Soviet and German powers. We pity it but will leave it aside for now.</p>
<p>As for Japan, for the past two or three years, besides its invasion of China, its diplomacy has been seen to be revolving around courting or antagonizing Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and Germany. Furthermore, it has been demonstrating aggression towards French Indochina, exerting pressure on Portuguese Macau, and coveting the Dutch East Indies. Its various actions have seemed to scatter attention everywhere, darting left and right, almost to the point of causing dizziness. This kind of diplomatic tactic is probably something that Japanese diplomatic officials since Mutsu Munemitsu and Komura Jutarō could not have even dreamed of. But what has been achieved?</p>
<p>Japan has not only achieved nothing at present but will inevitably suffer the consequences. However, there is something that cannot be ignored, because Japan, in its diplomatic tactics, also has a fundamental basis that remains constant amidst all the changes, and it is vigorously pursuing it in different ways with a persevering spirit. Consider the speech given by Japanese Foreign Minister Arita Hachirō to the Japan International Association on the 4th of this month, in which he strongly criticized the reckless high-sounding rhetoric among the Japanese people of punishing Britain and the United States and waging war against the Soviet Union, and advocated for improving relations with the United States and the Soviet Union. Arita has always been the diplomat who most represents the radical opinions of the Japanese military, having personally concluded the Anti-Comintern Pact and being the mastermind behind last year's anti-British movement. Now, he is appearing to admonish the nation with a mature and cautious attitude, which cannot help but cause a sense of surprise. However, this is not Arita being abnormal, but rather a tactic of Japan. Arita also said: "Although the feelings of Americans towards Japan are particularly bad, we must not provoke them." However, the most recent action by the Japanese side to provoke the United States was Arita's personally issued statement about preparing to interfere in the Dutch East Indies. With a difference of only twenty days between these two events, the change in attitude is so stark that it aptly illustrates the fickleness of Japanese diplomacy.</p>
<p>From a principled point of view, diplomacy cannot exert an independent function. In peacetime, it is subordinate to politics, and in wartime, it is subservient to military affairs. Moreover, diplomacy can only supplement what politics and military affairs cannot achieve; it can never fundamentally change the basic state of affairs in military and political aspects. It seems that the Japanese authorities have a misconception: they always regard diplomacy as the "Philosopher's Stone" in alchemy, hoping to achieve through diplomacy what they cannot achieve in the political and military spheres. All the difficulties and predicaments brought about by their basic national policy are entrusted to the Kasumigaseki authorities [Japanese Foreign Ministry] to resolve. This is a difficult problem that the diplomatic authorities of any country have never encountered, and its failure is clearly not just the fault of the general incompetence of Japanese diplomats. This situation has led to the distorted posture of Japan's foreign policy today, revealing Japan's inner anxieties. That kind of foolishly arrogant rhetoric and grandiose pronouncements are indeed caused by the narrow-minded and impulsive national character of the islanders, but they are also a kind of function of Japanese diplomacy. For example, the progress of the Anglo-Japanese talks in Tokyo last summer was the result of this kind of soft and hard tactics. Western countries have been in contact with Japan since the time of Commodore Perry nearly a century ago, but they often lack a deep understanding. Taking recent facts into account, except for the Soviet Union's profound and opportunistic diplomatic strategy that sometimes makes Japan look ridiculous, other countries are often deceived by Japan's deliberately contrived diplomatic posture. Although the Japanese authorities have not been able to fulfill their grand ambition of using diplomacy to alleviate the deficiencies of military and political affairs, their idea that Western countries can be deceived by their methods still continues to this day.</p>
<p>The significance of Arita's speech this time lies in its admonishment to the Japanese people, but what he hopes for is that Western countries will accept this Eastern version of ingratiating charm. Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman Suma Yakichiro stated on the 1st of this month that he is willing to conclude non-aggression treaties with various small countries or colonies in Asia to guarantee the status quo in the Far East. His intention is the same as that of Arita's speech. Arita's statement on April 15 regarding the Dutch East Indies has already caused a negative reaction from the United States. The new immigration bill in the Philippines has also restricted Japanese migration to the Philippines. There is news that the US fleet will remain in the Far East for a long time after major exercises in the Pacific. In addition, there is a possibility that the US Congress will reconsider the anti-Japanese embargo bills proposed by Pittman and others before the June recess. All of these pressures are forcing the Japanese side to adopt a moderate attitude towards the United States to gain goodwill. It is said that when U.S. High Commissioner to the Philippines Sayre visited Japan recently, Arita tried his best to be humble and friendly, which is exactly in line with the aforementioned expressions of Arita and Suma.</p>
<p>However, all of this is merely a superficial posture. It cannot represent Japan's true foreign policy direction, nor can it affect its basic expansionist policy. Perhaps the Japanese zaibatsu are preparing to secretly extend their terrible claws of aggression under this sugar-coated exterior. Since Arita's statement was met with setbacks internationally, the Japanese side has not promoted this issue much, but one should not mistakenly believe that the Japanese zaibatsu will truly retreat in the face of difficulties. Japan's southward advance plan has been premeditated and carefully arranged for many years. Especially now that the war of aggression against China has dragged on without success, they will not relax their grip on this treasure trove that is within easy reach. According to yesterday's news, the relationship between the Netherlands and Germany has become extremely strained, and it is conceivable that Japan's soaring ambitions are about to try again.</p>
<p>The United States' firm stance in the Far East is undoubtedly undeniable, but its measures are often deemed to be overly cautious or slow. Japan is exploiting this situation by putting on a charming display on the outside, in order to ease the United States' intense public sentiment. It is better to take decisive action than to try to fix things after they have gone wrong. This is the lesson that recent events in Europe have taught us. We hope that the United States will not repeat the mistakes of Britain in Europe in the Far East.</p>

<h3>Moscow Newspaper Denounces Finland for Violating the Peace Treaty: Destruction of All Industries in the Ceded Area, Believing This Action Will Surely Instigate Someone</h3>
<p>Moscow: Today, the "Pravda" published an article stating that construction work is actively underway in the area of Finland handed over to the Soviet Union. At the same time, it denounced Finland for violating its promises. The article stated, "In various towns and cities, houses and streets have been repaired, and countless people have gained employment. However, the Finnish authorities destroyed various factories before the handover. For example, the weaving factory in Yaskholm. If a person were to witness the state of destruction, they would believe that a barbarian tribe was active there. The majority of the machines were destroyed by the Finnish side with axes, and the degree of destruction was extremely deep, enough to suggest that the Finnish side intended to make it completely impossible for the factory to resume work. A detailed examination of the extent of the damage proves that this destruction work was carried out after the signing of the Soviet-Finnish peace treaty and before the Finnish troops withdrew. The Finnish conspiracy is extremely obvious. They intend to claim that this destruction was the result of air raids and shelling. However, since no fighting ever occurred near Kexholm, their sophistry is self-defeating. The above destruction is only part of it. In addition, power plants, boiler plants, etc., were also completely destroyed. 410 motors and water pumps were also taken away. In short, all the machines have either been destroyed or taken away. Moreover, the upper level of the factory was not damaged, while the lower level was severely damaged. This proves that the lower level was destroyed by explosives. After the Soviet troops occupied the area, they discovered explosives in various factories. Fortunately, there was not enough time for the explosives to detonate. On the first day that the Red Army occupied Kexholm, they removed more than 500 catties of explosives. These explosives were enough to completely destroy the factory and turn it to ashes. According to a Finnish deserter, 'After the establishment of the Soviet-Finnish peace treaty, the Finnish White Guard organized special teams to carry out the destruction of factory machines and objects inside the buildings. Kexholm is no exception. All the generators, etc., in the Haru weaving factory were completely destroyed. In addition, part of the Lierikla paper mill was destroyed. This work was all carried out by special agents organized by the Finnish White Guard.</p>
<p>The destruction work in Enso was even more insidious. Although the exterior of the Enso paper mill did not show any damage, the interior was also cunningly damaged by special agents. Since there was no fighting near Enso, the factory could have been handed over to the Soviet Union. However, before withdrawing, the Finnish side also destroyed it. As for the machinery of the factory, it was taken away by the Finnish side. The Finnish side also believed that the machinery would not be easily restored. Undoubtedly, the factory was destroyed after the signing of the peace treaty, and the extent of the damage was not easy to detect, but it made it impossible for the factory to resume work. According to eyewitnesses, when the Red Army occupied Enso, a large number of factory machines were piled up on the Finnish border.</p>
<p>An annex to the Soviet-Finnish peace treaty published on March 13 stated the following provisions: 'First, the commanders of both sides agree to take necessary steps during the troop withdrawal to prevent the destruction of cities and buildings of defensive and economic nature, such as bridges, water gates, airfields, barracks, military depots, railway junctions, industrial facilities, telegraphs and power plants.' What we want to know is, who allowed the Finnish side to destroy the Soviet-Finnish peace treaty so unreasonably? According to the treaty, our commanders have returned Petsamo to Finland in its original condition, with the streets and houses all repaired. Moreover, when the treaty annex was signed, the Red Army command had restored the work of the telegraph and telephone bureau, the power plant, and the water plant in the Petsamo area. The above-mentioned industries and the shipyard in Linankhamari were handed over to the Finnish army and were all in very good condition. How could the Finnish commanders allow their subordinates to carry out destruction work in the areas handed over to the Soviet Union? Has the Finnish side fulfilled its promises? The newspaper published photos of the destruction situation at the Kexholm factory as evidence." (TASS dispatch of the 7th)</p>
<h3>After Naval Exercises, the US Fleet Remains Stationed in the Hawaiian Area, Taking Precautionary Measures for the Dutch East Indies, Warning Japan Not to Take Action</h3>
<p>Honolulu: It was announced here last night that the U.S. fleet will remain indefinitely in Hawaiian waters. U.S. Fleet Commander Admiral Richardson stated that the Navy Department has approved his plan to keep the U.S. fleet in the Hawaiian area for further tactical exercises. It is said that "the U.S. fleet will leave Pearl Harbor next week and go to the Lahaina area for exercises." The peacetime organization of the Hawaiian fleet consists of 20 destroyers and 8 cruisers. (Associated Press dispatch of the 8th)</p>
<p>Washington: The news that the U.S. Navy Department announced that the exercise fleet would remain stationed in Hawaii has surprised Washingtonians and sparked various rumors. The U.S. fleet currently exercising in Hawaii has a total of 90 warships, including two aircraft carriers and 11 battleships. Political figures speculate that the reason why the U.S. military ordered the fleet to remain in the Pacific is because of various rumors regarding the future of the Dutch East Indies, and thus precautionary measures are being taken. (Haitong News Agency dispatch of the 8th)</p>
<p>Washington: Although official sources here indicate that the long-term stationing of the U.S. fleet in Hawaiian waters is for training purposes, diplomatic observers believe that this action by the United States is clearly a political act, intended to warn Japan not to take any actions that could be considered belligerent. Diplomatic observers cite recent remarks by U.S. Secretary of State Hull that any attempt to change the status quo of the Dutch East Indies would endanger peace in the Pacific as proof. Senator William King, a Democrat from Utah, actively supports the long-term stationing of the U.S. Navy in Hawaii. King stated that the United States has the right to station its fleet in the Pacific when necessary. No one can question the legitimacy of this action by the United States. The U.S. fleet, no matter where it is stationed, has nothing to do with Japan unless it is in Japanese territorial waters. King also stated that we have obtained much evidence regarding Japan's attempt to expand its influence in the East. If U.S.-Japan relations can be improved, we certainly do not want to express opinions against Japan. However, the stationing of the U.S. fleet in Hawaii should not hinder the improvement of U.S.-Japan relations. Presidential secretary Ely reportedly told the chief executive yesterday that the U.S. fleet will remain in Hawaii indefinitely. Naval experts point out that the decision to keep the U.S. fleet stationed in Hawaii long-term was made when the European war expanded. (Associated Press dispatch of the 8th)</p>
<p>Washington: U.S. Secretary of the Navy Edison urged Congress yesterday at the Senate Naval Committee to vote on a bill to build 300,000 tons of warships during this session. He stated, in brief, that large warships have always been the backbone of naval fleets. No matter how air power develops, the experience gained in the Norwegian naval battles does not necessarily mean that large warships have lost their effectiveness. Norwegian harbors are narrow, so British large warships could not exert their power and encountered German aircraft bombing. The large warships built in the United States are prepared for various bases in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. (Haitong News Agency dispatch of the 8th)</p>
<p>Washington: U.S. Secretary of the Navy Edison said in a speech to the Senate Naval Committee yesterday that the United States will still need warships as the backbone of its national defense in the coming years. He also said that he had learned from reliable sources that German aircraft had not sunk any British battleships in the recent European war. All U.S. warships are the best of the warship structures known to us, and there are constant improvements, comparable to the current air force. (Associated Press dispatch of the 8th)</p>

<h3>Military Setbacks in Norway, British House of Commons Opens a Major Debate: Opposition Parties Accuse the Government of Mismanagement, Demanding That the Current Policy Be Put to a Vote</h3>
<p>London: The opposition Labour Party parliamentary group held a meeting at 11:30 this morning, chaired by party leader Major Attlee, to discuss the political situation. It lasted for more than an hour and then concluded. It was immediately decided that when the House of Commons convenes this evening, it will demand that the government's policies be put to a vote. There are two ways to do this: (1) Introduce a motion of no confidence in the current cabinet; (2) Express opposition to the government's motion to adjourn the House. "In order to take into account the feelings of government-affiliated members who are still unwilling to openly condemn the government, the Labour Party may adopt the second method to express dissatisfaction with the current cabinet. However, the government can still obtain the support of a majority of votes." (Havas dispatch of the 8th)</p>
<p>London: After British Prime Minister Chamberlain finished speaking in the House of Commons yesterday, opposition Labour Party leader Major Attlee, opposition Liberal Party leader Sinclair, and Conservative Party member Admiral Keyes all delivered speeches criticizing all the facilities of the government in the Norwegian war. The speeches of the three gentlemen are recorded below.</p>
<h3>Attlee: Pointing out Weaknesses</h3>
<p>When Major Attlee spoke, he first warmly praised the British, French, and Norwegian troops, expressed sympathy for the Norwegian people, and admired the skill of carrying out the withdrawal in difficult circumstances. Attlee continued, "We already have experience in withdrawing troops during the last war. This time, it is even more difficult due to aerial attacks. This is truly an astonishing war record. However, in the final analysis, this is a retreat. The Prime Minister's speech on Thursday seemed overly optimistic and satisfied, while Churchill's speech was even more optimistic. Although the Prime Minister advised us not to make hasty judgments, it is useless. There are already some very hasty judgments in the speeches of the Prime Minister and the First Lord of the Admiralty. In terms of the facts, it is difficult to say that this war is beneficial to our side, as the Prime Minister said on Thursday. The Prime Minister's tone has changed today, with various excuses and explanations. We are certainly unwilling to give our enemies ammunition, but we have a responsibility to the people of our country to study the various things that have happened. We must deal with the facts, and we are not afraid of the facts. The fact now is that it is a setback. Cabinet members are full of hope in their speeches to journalists and on the radio. I think it is a mistake to speak to the public and encourage them to have the illusion that everything is going exceptionally well and to excite their spirits. I think the authorities should not do this, but should provide more guidance. We are now feeling pain because disappointment has occurred after great expectations. We all know that we must keep in mind the needs of a larger strategy, but this does not mean that we should launch a military expedition that retreats at the slightest touch.</p>
<p>Never Took the Initiative</p>
<p>The initial general opinion was that Germany had stuck its head out to be struck, and that Britain had the opportunity to launch a war. What is even more disappointing now is precisely because of this. We hear that our side has never taken the initiative in this war, and there is no real plan to prevent possible attacks by the enemy. The government did have the idea of using mines to block the Narvik route, but the extreme possibility of a German counterattack was clearly visible. What preparations did the government make for this possibility? This is the first question. The Prime Minister once said that Germany, with great caution, spent a long period of time planning the expedition to Norway. Then, what was the caution of the Allied forces in their plan to defeat this German offensive? In March, the government told people that 100,000 soldiers were prepared to go to Finland, and stated that this army was fully prepared. If so, then we want to know where this army is now. The Finnish war ended in March, and the government's decision to lay mines off the coast of Norway on April 8 was made after the end of the Finnish war. I think if the government intended to lay mines, it should have retained this army to prevent a German counterattack. So, why did the government immediately disperse this army at that time? This is what I am very confused about. I heard that some troops have been kept intact, then I want to know if these troops are fully equipped, and if they have the necessary equipment and the ships and aircraft needed for transportation. I want to know even more if this army is an excellent army. I once heard that we had a batch of trained soldiers who could ski, prepared to participate in the Finnish war, but then I heard that the army had been dispersed and assigned to other tasks. When there was a possibility of war in Norway, why was this army dispersed? The people are now asking why this army should go to Norway. I have heard that those sent to Norway are poorly trained young people. The climate in Norway is extremely cold, and those who should be sent are experienced, older soldiers, not young people. In the past, we sent young people to the Dardanelles, which made them unable to withstand the war. The previous experience is still there, so what is needed now is people who are adapted to various climates. As for the fact that the Germans expected the British to take mine-laying action and invaded Norway, what kind of information did the government receive from informants?</p>
<p>Strategic Blunder</p>
<p>According to the Prime Minister's previously published remarks, we have long known that German and transport ships have repeatedly conducted boarding exercises, and there are four or five countries that Germany may launch an aggression against, making it difficult to determine for a while. I certainly know that it is extremely difficult to obtain information in Germany, but we can assert that we must have an intelligence agency in Norway. Therefore, it is hard to believe that we heard nothing about this careful plan that has been going on for many months in Norway and Denmark. I want to know if we have obtained any information and whether we have made proper use of the information we have obtained. As far as I know, we have been preparing for many years for the German General Staff's plan to occupy Norway. I want to know if we have taken all steps to counter it.</p>
<p>The question that immediately caught my attention was the issue of strategically important bases. The first condition is that they must not be threatened by air and sea. The time factor is also extremely important. German troops only dispatched a small number of troops to land at certain selected locations. If they have sufficient time, they will continue to send reinforcements, making it extremely difficult for Allied troops to land. The most important thing at the moment is to obtain an air force base. Although this is a dangerous action, it must be taken at the risk. I want to know if the government made a decision early on or acted hastily on a temporary basis. In fact, Narvik is indeed important, but Stavanger or Trondheim are truly important locations. Judging from the situation, the government still does not seem to recognize the importance of air power until after the fact. I am very disturbed by what the Prime Minister said. Although the government has witnessed the lessons learned from Poland and Finland, it does not seem to have recognized the importance of air defense.</p>
<p>Cannot Deny Delay</p>
<p>What I am asking now is whether action was taken in time. The landing of German troops in Trondheim was more than ten days away from the landing of our troops in Namsos and Andalsnes. It is questionable to what extent the government carried out plans and maintained troops to cope with this contingency. Since we cannot obtain an air force base, withdrawal is inevitable, but the fact that the South Norwegian military failed cannot be changed because of this. Some say that we can start again and attack from Narvik, which is extremely difficult in fact. In addition, it is also of military importance to prevent German reinforcements. Although we cannot prevent German reinforcements in the air, we have more optimistic hopes for the actions of the naval fleet. When we consider the time when this withdrawal began, there is an important factor, which is the degree to which we can successfully prevent enemy reinforcements. We must also admit that the combined defense capabilities that the Norwegian people can launch are still unknown. In my opinion, our plan does not seem to have been considered in advance with clever foresight. We lack sufficient alertness and lack the necessary concentration on various major objectives. I don't know if there will be delays and discussions at any time when action is needed.</p>
<p>I am still not satisfied with the Prime Minister's various claims that the current wartime cabinet is an efficient tool for carrying out the war. This House has repeatedly criticized it. The remarks of other experienced people, and newspapers and platforms, have also criticized it as having erroneous cabinet principles. If victory can be achieved now, there is still something to say, but this victory has not been achieved. I frankly admit that it is not appropriate for Churchill to serve as both First Lord of the Admiralty and Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee.</p>
<p>At this point in Attlee's speech, the Prime Minister interjected that Churchill would not serve as chairman and would not attend every meeting of the Chiefs of Staff. Attlee continued, "It is against all the conventions of military strategy and organization to have a person in charge of important military affairs at the same time directing a special part of it. Churchill already has various great difficulties, and now it is unfair to put him in an impossible position."</p>
<p>Your Leadership is Unreliable</p>
<p>Attlee added, "We are now facing a decisive defeat, and our friends are disappointed by it. But we have had repeated failures in the past, and I have never wavered in my belief that we will win. (Cheers from the crowd) When we encounter failures, we must learn from them, which is extremely important. (Cheers from the crowd) I firmly believe that the courage and perseverance of the people of the country only need proper leadership. (Cheers from the opposition) People in our country, no matter what their views or thoughts, are not anxious and believe that the war is not being carried out with sufficient energy and determination. If the government has not heard of this, it must be both blind and deaf. The government has taken various inappropriate actions, and the Norwegian matter is only the most recent. It is said that those who bear the main administrative responsibility have a history of almost uninterrupted failures. (Cheers from the opposition) Norway, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and any other place have all failed because they were 'too late'. The Prime Minister mentioned 'missing the train', but in fact, the government has missed the train more than once since 1931. What they missed was the peace train, and what they boarded was the war train.</p>
<p>The judgments of the government officials are always wrong. They believe that Hitler would not attack Czechoslovakia and that Hitler could be subdued. They also seem not to have anticipated Hitler's invasion of Norway. In short, they have failed to grasp the facts and deal with them everywhere. This is not only the case in national defense and diplomacy, but also in the domestic situation. To this day, the government has not adjusted the country's resources. Eight months after the war began, all of these events should have been held, but to this day, there has been no organization of food or manpower. This is due to a lack of effective leadership. The morale of the whole country has a backlash.</p>
<p>The Times editorial said that the Prime Minister's weakness lies in being attached to colleagues who have either failed or need to rest. Know that at this critical moment of life and death, we cannot let our destiny be manipulated by those who have already failed or need to rest. I am not sure if the Prime Minister has this weakness, but the government-affiliated members do have this weakness. It is not that they have not seen the repeated failures, but they know it and still tolerate it. They would rather let their loyalty to the party leader obliterate their loyalty to the country's true needs. (Cheers from the opposition) The House must take on the entire responsibility at this point. The whole country now holds a certain victory, but if you want to win, those who wield the national reins must be replaced, and be different from the people who led us into this crisis. (Cheers from the crowd)</p>
<h3>Sinclair's Eloquent Speech</h3>
<p>Following the Free Party's Sinclair, who began his speech with words of admiration for the bravery of the Allied forces in Norway, he then said that he did not find it strange that the Chief of Staff felt anxious about possible developments in the debate. However, he regretted that the Prime Minister had already stated that the debate must be absolutely free, and there should be no suggestions from external parties, the military, or any other source as to how the debate should proceed. Regarding the government's decision to withdraw troops from Norway, Attlee had already criticized it, and he did not want to continue with the criticism. He had heard that the government's decision was based on the Chief of Staff's advice that there was no hope of successfully capturing Trondheim. From his perspective, it was right for the government to act on the advice of its military advisors in this situation. What we want to criticize and investigate now is the question of how we reached this point where we have to admit failure in Norway. Although this is not a major military defeat, and does not shake our confidence in the courage and efficiency of our troops, it shows that in the highest guidance of our war effort, there must be a broader vision, greater boldness, and a stronger determination.</p>
<p>Hiding One's Head in the Sand</p>
<p>Although the military impact of our failure in Norway cannot be compared to what we encountered in the last great war, it is enough to make people unhappy. I do not want to exaggerate, but we must face the facts and not bury our heads in the sand. The number of casualties is not negligible, and the loss of materials is not insignificant. We have lost some war equipment, several warships, and the current supply of these materials is temporarily insufficient. The military impact is like this, and the impact in other areas is even more serious. The Prime Minister did not say a word about the economic aspects of this matter. In fact, we have lost various supplies from Norway, Denmark, Sweden, and the Baltic countries. The Baltic Sea is now blocked, and we can no longer access it. The 570,000 tons of ore that we transported from Narvik will probably also be cut off in the future. When we recapture Narvik in the future, we will see that the Germans have destroyed all the valuable items there.</p>
<p>Weakened International Prestige</p>
<p>In terms of diplomacy, our position in various countries around the world has been weakened by the military failure in Norway. It is pathetic to compare the unfounded self-satisfied remarks made by some of our cabinet members with the solid and rapid blows made by the enemy's troops. In war, it is the results that count, not empty words. Our newspapers and broadcasts have also been severely hit. The Prime Minister blamed the news from Stockholm for being too embellished. I also believe that the news from Stockholm is confusing, but British journalists, reporters from British territories, and foreign journalists have all accused me of the misleading nature of some of the communiqués. The communiqués praised the success of the troop landings, leading to optimism about everything going well. Even people in the news media were misled about the true situation.</p>
<p>Lack of Preparation in Everything</p>
<p>In the economic, political, propaganda, and military aspects, we have failed everywhere. The main reason for this is that our war effort has not been supported and promoted with a fully determined war spirit in all departments and policies. If the British army had been prepared early, it should have arrived in Norway within ten days, before the German army arrived with its planes. We should have had a strong army ready to move out immediately. We knew the truth of the crisis early on, and we should have made declarations to neutral countries about the preparations they should be making and the genuine assistance we were willing to provide them. But we had no such preparation. The key to the situation was not Narvik, but Trondheim, because Trondheim is a strategically important point where victory or defeat is determined. Now that the German army has occupied it, the best gateway for Britain to enter Norway is now closed. If the occupation of Trondheim had been made impossible, then the Norwegian Expeditionary Force should not have been dispatched. If the occupation of Trondheim was possible, then the dispatch of the expeditionary force should have been supported with an unwavering determination.</p>
<p>The Enemy and Us Compared</p>
<p>Although Germany has sacrificed one-third of its fleet, its fleet has helped it achieve a victory that the German navy has never had before. The Prime Minister criticized Germany for disregarding the lives of its soldiers when deploying reinforcements, but the German losses in the Skagerrak battle, estimated at 10,000, must be an overestimate. However, the cost of a new type of battle for this victory is not too great a sacrifice. The German army advanced aggressively from Oslo, while our army lingered outside Trondheim.</p>
<p>Troops Not Fully Equipped</p>
<p>Those who should have been sent to Norway were well-trained soldiers, not local troops. Attlee has already spoken about this in detail, and I agree with him. I cannot remain silent about the government's failure to provide this army with equipment such as snowshoes. In one place, two anti-aircraft guns were transported ashore, but there were no suitable gun mounts, no suitable gunners, and no instruments for indicating the trajectory of the shells, rendering the two anti-aircraft guns completely useless. Furthermore, one transport ship did not have an accurate clock, nor a barometer or an international code book. The ship was not equipped with weapons, not even rifles, and the food it carried was insufficient. There were some wounded soldiers on board, but no medical care. The arrangement was so poor.</p>
<p>Finally Speaking of Sweden</p>
<p>Sinclair spoke to this point, and Naval Secretary Churchill rose to ask a question. Sinclair replied that he would secretly tell the Naval Secretary the name of the ship. Sinclair finally spoke of Sweden, saying that it would be expected that Sweden would receive an 'aide-mémoire' within one or two weeks. Now that Sweden has been surrounded, it is unknown whether Britain can still help Sweden resist German aggression. Time is not on our side, Hitler has already grabbed the old man's beard. If we want to win, we must be as quick in spirit and action.</p>
<h3>Keyes Defends the Navy</h3>
<p>Admiral Keyes stood up in uniform, and the crowd responded with cheers. Keyes said that some people had suggested that the British Navy had fled to Alexandria, which was a heinous insult (the crowd laughed, and the Speaker also echoed). He then said that it was not the Navy's fault that the British Navy did not follow the German warships and transports into the Norwegian ports and destroy them, as was done in Narvik. He meant that the difficulty of the Navy attacking Trondheim was minor compared to the difficulties overcome in other battles he had previously organized and commanded. This can be supported by the intelligence responsible for Norway. Since April 16, he had been urging the Admiralty to take more aggressive action in Norway, and to give him full responsibility for organizing and leading the attack. The Admiralty told him that there was no difficulty in sailing into Trondheim Bay, that the army was making good progress, so there was no need for the Navy, and that the overall situation in the Mediterranean was urgent, so they did not want warships to risk fighting in Trondheim. He also suggested that old warships be used for this operation, so that even if there were losses, they would not affect the strength of the fleet.</p>
<h3>Amery Advocates Government Reorganization</h3>
<p>Following, Conservative Party MP Amery rose and said that the entire war operation, as far as is known, should be thoroughly investigated (the crowd cheered). Today, there is no other loyalty than loyalty to the common cause (the whole house cheered). He felt that there was not a word in the Prime Minister's speech to indicate that the government had foreseen what Germany intended to do, or had made a clear decision when it knew what Germany was doing, or had taken swift or resolute action in the overall tragic event. The page of the Norwegian war is not a single page, but is related to the denial of Finland's request for military assistance and the hesitation and slowness in dealing with various war problems. There is no doubt that the gap between the German and our forces in the past eight months has widened. We cannot do anything with what we are doing now, so it must be reformed (the opposition party cheered loudly). The next blow could happen at any time, either in the Netherlands or in the Mediterranean, which cannot be predicted. We must quickly establish the highest war command, and we must have a proper war cabinet like the Lloyd George cabinet in the last great war. The opposition party should earnestly take on their true responsibilities and form a truly united national government. Now is the time.</p>
<h3>War Secretary Stanley Ends the Debate</h3>
<p>War Secretary Stanley spoke to end the first day of the debate, saying that he thought the public had a wrong impression of what the Prime Minister had said in the House about the Chief of Staff. In replying to the responsibility for the Norwegian war, the War Secretary said that it was futile to exaggerate the setbacks of our army in the past few weeks, and that it would be ridiculous to call it a disaster, but it would be equally dangerous to despise it, and equally dangerous to falsely claim that the losses of personnel and war materials were small, or that the losses of prestige and morale were not great. He felt that the shock to the whole country was increased because people mistakenly believed the various unfounded news spread by newspapers and radio, and had the idea that our army was winning. This is very true. As for the part where our army won, anyone who looks at the map calmly cannot believe it is true. The communiqués issued by the War Office did not exaggerate the war situation. Every time a communiqué was issued by the War Office, it was carefully drafted, with the aim of not making the public optimistic, or making them think that our army had already won, because in fact we had not won. Unexpectedly, the public still has false optimism, which is really regrettable. The War Secretary then reiterated what the Prime Minister had said about disbanding the Finnish Expeditionary Force, and asked the House to understand that although the government's thoughts were completely focused on Norway today, in the past few weeks or months, the places at risk were not only Finland. The government had received news early on that German warships were ready to depart, which was certainly true. It was also clear that Germany's attack on Norway was a possibility, and even more so. I must now frankly admit that I, like my government colleagues, was told that the German attack would be launched in southern Norway, not in the ports of western Norway. If you want to attack the government, then you should at least consider the situation in which Norway asked for help. We ask ourselves why our intelligence did not clearly make us know Germany's plans, or know Norway's position. The content of Germany's plans was not easy to know, almost as if they wanted to get news here. The Norwegian government knew nothing of Germany's plans. Until April 9, the overall situation in Norway suddenly changed greatly, and even before asking for our help, all the ports, airfields, and arsenals in the country had been surrendered. We sent troops to land in various places, not blindly unaware of the difficulties, nor blindly unaware of the difficulties in the sky, because Norway had no airfield available for us to use. Politically speaking, it can be said that because our army landed in Norway, we have lost prestige in the world, but what we have lost is not much. If our army had not tried to land in Norway, then the prestige lost would have been even greater (Reuters dispatch on the 8th).</p>
<h3>British House of Commons Second Day of Debate Chamberlain Accepts Labour Challenge Morrison Claims Prime Minister, Chancellor, and Air Secretary Are Incompetent</h3>
<p>London Today, when the House of Commons continued to debate the Norwegian incident, the Labour opposition party moved to take a vote on the government's war attitude to test the mood of the House. Prime Minister Chamberlain accepted, and cheers erupted at the time. This challenge motion was put forward by Labour MP Morrison. After Morrison attacked the government's mismanagement of the Norwegian war, he pointed out that Chamberlain, Simon (Chancellor), and Hoare (Air Secretary) were not up to the job. These three had not avoided the war, and anyone who was responsible was huge, and declared that the Labour opposition party would test the House's support tonight. After Morrison finished his speech, the Prime Minister jumped up and said, "Morrison's remarks a moment ago forced me to make one or two interventions at this stage. The seriousness of the matter at the beginning of Morrison's speech, the challenge he made to the entire government, and the attack he made on government officials, especially myself, have made the incident even more serious. As the leader of the government, I naturally accept the basic responsibility for the government's actions, and my colleagues do not hesitate to accept their responsibility for the government's actions. However, the seriousness of the matter is not due to human reasons. If we all lose the trust of this House, none of us are willing to remain in office for a moment. The seriousness of the matter is really because I warned the House yesterday that this is a day of national crisis. We are now facing a brutal enemy and must fight it with the united action of the whole country. It is right to attack the government, and I do not want to avoid responsibility. However, I must tell this House that I have many friends in this House (the government party cheered loudly), that no government can conduct war effectively without the support of the public and Parliament. I now accept the challenge, and I certainly welcome it. At least because of this move, who supports us and who opposes us can be distinguished. I would like to ask my friends to support us in tonight's movement (the crowd cheered loudly).</p>
<p>London Today, when the House of Commons began the second day of the Norwegian war debate, London Labour Secretary Morrison earnestly stated the seriousness of the Norwegian incident, saying that if we severely criticize the government's mismanagement and involve certain people, it is definitely not because of party prejudice. Anyone who helps to achieve victory, I will praise him. The deeper the debate goes, the more I feel that the cabinet members' perfunctory handling of affairs should be severely condemned. What is especially regrettable is that Naval Secretary Churchill is responsible for the major war affairs, and will now make the final speech so that the evidence he presents will not be commented on. Morrison also said that it was a shocking act to disperse the expeditionary force that was being prepared to go to Finland. He did not know whether the government had attached importance to the assurances given to Norway, considering it an important part of our war effort, or just fulfilling a moral obligation to avoid being criticized. Morrison asked, When did the government first learn that Germany was planning to attack Norway and Denmark? When did the first information about the German transport fleet's actions reach us? How long was it from the arrival of the information to the real action? Morrison also mentioned the laying of mines in Norwegian territorial waters, saying that it was very unwise to let Hitler know in advance what we were going to do before doing what we wanted to do. The government should have measured the shipyards, harbors, bays, and airfields early so that it would know where to use troops and arrive there quickly. Judging from the current situation, it seems that no such work has been done (to be continued) (Reuters dispatch on the 8th).</p>
<h3>Chamberlain's Full Speech (Continued)</h3>
<p>There is one more thing that cannot be forgotten, that is, transporting British and French troops requires many ships, and the ships must be prepared for a long time to be used. The Germans cannot use their ships on the high seas and can let their ships wait for a long time until they think the time is ripe to invade neutral countries, but we are in a different situation. We can use every ton of shipping space to transport food, raw materials, armaments, and war materials to this country, and there is absolutely no reason to prepare ships for a long time to wait for an expedition to the Scandinavian Peninsula or a possible opportunity. We have indeed prepared some troops to occupy some Norwegian ports after Germany violates Norwegian neutrality. We had reason to believe at the time that it was necessary to send a relatively small number of troops to occupy these ports before the main force landed. After occupying the ports, although they cooperated with the troops landed in Namsos and Åndalsnes, the military strength was ultimately too weak to restore their position. Finally, the question arose as to whether we should withdraw our troops since we felt that the battle of Trondheim could not be sustained for long, or whether we should send reinforcements to try again. I think it is right to send reinforcements to attack again, and it is also justifiable to withdraw troops when the attack plan clearly has no hope of success (the crowd cheered).</p>
<p>There Are Two Reasons for the Setback</p>
<p>There are two reasons for this failure: one is that we failed to obtain airfields for our fighter planes to use, and the other is the speed at which German reinforcements arrived. We often thought that if our army could land, it would not be greatly affected by the air strikes. In fact, this expectation was correct, but our fighter planes' failure to operate on the front line allowed the enemy to destroy our transportation and prevent the advance of reinforcements, while the enemy's own transportation allowed the enemy's reinforcements to arrive continuously and eventually gain the upper hand. At this point, the situation was clear. If we wanted to maintain our army in Trondheim, we would have to allocate a very large part of our entire resources, concentrating soldiers, war materials, and fighter planes, which would be possible later. We decided that it would be better to fight with greater strength and greater effect in other parts of Norway. Fortunately, with the skills and courage of all parties, our army successfully withdrew from the Trondheim area. I have now answered the important points of criticism. As for technical issues, such as the organization and equipment of our army, I will leave it to my colleagues to explain in detail. However, I would like to make a general observation to the House:</p>
<p>It Is Too Early to Say Who Will Win</p>
<p>First, I ask members not to rush to judge the results. Germany has indeed won some victories at this time, but it has paid a heavy price (the crowd cheered). It is too early to ask who will win today. The war is not over yet, and most of Norway has not fallen into the hands of the Germans. The Norwegian King and government are still in Norway and will regroup and defend themselves together with the Allied forces. Norwegian Foreign Minister Koht made a broadcast, advising Norwegians to be patient and persevere. His words are indeed important. We should help Norway as soon as possible as we can, but we must not forget that in addition to Norway, there are other fronts that could erupt at any time. Germany, with its large and powerful army, is in a position to attack any point at any time. We must be prepared to deal with attacks from any direction (the meeting place shouted "Pay attention, listen to it"). The more important the point, the more prepared we should be.</p>
<p>Interpretation of Hitler's Missed Train</p>
<p>Cabinet members who express optimism are often considered complacent, while those who do not express optimism are seen as dejected. I strive to walk in the middle (one member shouted "You missed the train"), I do not make excessive expectations that may not be realized (someone shouted "Oh"), nor do I make the people hold infinite joy and sorrow. I said before that Hitler missed the train, and the listeners thought that it referred to the German invasion of Norway. In fact, I made this statement three days before the German invasion of Norway (the listeners laughed). My original intention was that while we were discussing peace, they were already preparing for war. This is where the almighty country takes the lead. At the beginning of the war, the Germans' armaments and equipment were superior to ours. Hitler did not take advantage of this time when the advantages and disadvantages of both sides were most obvious to attack the Allied countries, which is called missing the time. Therefore, I used the metaphor of missing the train. This has nothing to do with the later events, but only a criticism of the previous events.</p>
<p>Avoid Internal Strife in the Face of a Strong Enemy</p>
<p>I think the significance of the Norwegian war has been exaggerated, and I still have complete confidence in the most handsome victory. However, I must say that I think the people of this country have not yet understood the extent and urgency of the threat we are facing (the crowd cheered). If we are not fools, then we should learn many useful lessons from the threat. I am not saying how our future strategy will change, but the Norwegian experience has shown how quickly the landscape changes. Therefore, we should be careful not to be tempted to be distracted, as the enemy wishes. With a strong enemy in front, this is not the time for us to have internal strife (the crowd cheered), but to straighten up our ranks, grit our teeth, do our best, and seek the day of common victory. In this debate, we give assurances for the future. Military advisors solemnly warned us of the danger of holding such a debate and strongly advised against holding such a debate, but we cannot accept their views, because in a democratic country, there must be criticism, and those who are criticized can defend themselves. Four cabinet members who have a direct relationship with the war will now speak. If there is no disclosure, then it is fortunate. Everyone is careful to prevent divisive actions. To say that a certain cabinet member should be more responsible for a certain action is worthless and incorrect. We have no differences with each other, and there is no conspiracy to overthrow each other. We only have one heart and one mind, that is, how to make the best contribution to victory.</p>
<p>Opposition to Changing the Form of the Cabinet</p>
<p>I know that there are people inside and outside Congress who are proposing or demanding a reorganization of the cabinet. I will not speak for the people's problems now, but I cannot remain silent about forming a cabinet that conforms to the law with many years of experience. My colleagues, Churchill and I, all believe that a cabinet composed purely of those without departmental affairs may not save time or have faster decisions, because when making decisions, one must not ignore those who must implement this decision, and those responsible for implementation must attend the meeting to decide the plan and express their opinions. Therefore, there is no real difference between inside and outside the cabinet, and both must bear the responsibility for deciding the plan. My unwillingness to accept the suggestion to change the form of the cabinet does not mean that I am unwilling to change the cabinet members or their positions at any time, as long as I think it is beneficial to the public interest, and I will not resign to give way to the virtuous.</p>
<p>Appeal for Unity to Cope with Difficult Times</p>
<p>I have repeatedly appealed to all parties to do their best at this difficult time and concentrate on improving the war effort (the crowd cheered loudly). Do not be stingy with the form of the government. The output of aircraft, tanks, artillery, armaments, and military supplies, and all kinds of objects that make them suitable, is what we should strive for. We must manufacture these objects with organization, perseverance, and good intentions. As far as we who serve in the government are concerned, we are doing our best to catch up with the starting point that Germany has prepared for many years. We have already obtained the full cooperation of employees and workers today, and I also want to obtain the cooperation of all parties to carry out the work that we all recognize as the most urgently needed at present.</p>
<p>Churchill Has Major Responsibilities</p>
<p>Naval Secretary and Chairman of the Three Services Committee, Churchill, will henceforth be responsible for the special responsibility of daily supervision of military operations, and has been given the power to guide the Chief of Staff Committee. After accepting the position of Chairman of the Cabinet Military Coordination Committee, Churchill, based on his experience, suggested that it would be best if he could have closer contact with the Chiefs of Staff so that he could give the Cabinet more effective assistance. I think Churchill's idea is good, so I discussed it in detail with the three Services Secretaries, and then tried to authorize Churchill by the Cabinet to represent the Military Coordination Committee to guide the Chief of Staff Committee, and to have the Committee prepare plans to carry out its purpose of reporting to Churchill. All Chiefs of Staff retain their collective responsibility to the Cabinet and the Three Services Secretaries, but Churchill will be responsible for the special responsibility of daily supervision of military operations. In this way, we can ensure that all aspects of military policy are studied, and the policies decided are quickly implemented.</p>
<p>Reply to Lloyd George's Question</p>
<p>After the Prime Minister spoke to this point, Lloyd George interjected, Does Churchill retain his current position? The Prime Minister replied, I will let Churchill decide whether he feels that his new job makes it difficult for him to continue to serve as Naval Secretary. The Prime Minister also said that Churchill did not obtain this new power before the Norwegian war occurred. For the above purposes, Churchill will have several personal staff, and this staff will be led by Major General Ismay, the senior staff officer who joined the Chief of Staff Committee (Reuters dispatch on the 7th).</p>
<h3>Roosevelt Prepares to Make Another Plea for Peace, Preventing the Spread of European War to the Mediterranean, Rumor of Another Meeting Between German and Italian Leaders</h3>
<p>Washington - It is now increasingly believed here that President Roosevelt will take action related to the war. According to some observers, the White House may take peace initiatives, and the Vatican will issue an appeal at the same time. President Roosevelt stated yesterday that he was drafting a speech for a scientific conference, abruptly breaking the precedent of not meeting with reporters. President Roosevelt dined with Gerard, who served as the US Ambassador to Germany from 1913 to 1917, yesterday. In the afternoon, he met with Welles, the Assistant Secretary of State. President Roosevelt recently met with former Secretary of State Stimson. According to sources close to the White House, President Roosevelt is very concerned about preventing the war from spreading to Italy. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>London - "London Exchange Telegraph" yesterday reprinted a Budapest radio report, stating that Führer Hitler may meet with Prime Minister Mussolini again soon. The report stated that the meeting place for the two Axis leaders will be in Munich or Innsbruck. (Associated Press, 8th)</p>
<h3>British Ambassador to Italy Visits the Italian Prime Minister, Delivering a Letter from Chamberlain</h3>
<p>London - Informed sources here recently stated that the United Kingdom's attitude towards the Soviet Union and Italy is mainly based on compromise, but also with a firm attitude. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<p>Rome - According to unconfirmed reports, Sir Noel Charles, the British Ambassador to Italy, immediately visited Prime Minister Mussolini and Foreign Minister Ciano after returning here from London yesterday. The diplomatic community here was deeply surprised upon hearing the news, believing that Ambassador Charles was likely representing the British government in delivering important documents, or even a letter from Prime Minister Chamberlain, to Prime Minister Mussolini. However, informed sources say that the claim that the ambassador visited Foreign Minister Ciano yesterday may not be reliable. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<h3>The Situation in the Balkans Relaxes, Germany Says It Has No Intention to Invade the Netherlands</h3>
<p>Budapest - According to observers here, the situation in Southeast Europe has eased slightly in the past 24 hours. As far as Hungary is concerned, its attitude is in line with the attitude of the German-Italian Axis, and it continues to improve its relations with Yugoslavia. Therefore, Hungarians are not very anxious about the situation. The pro-German "Magyar Nemzet" reported that foreign countries have claimed that Germany is preparing to attack Romania, which is not true. "If Germany had this intention, or asked Hungary to attack Romania, then why would it sell Messerschmitt aircraft and other military equipment to Romania?" (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>Berlin - German officials recently denied rumors that Germany was about to invade the Netherlands, saying that Germany had no plans to invade the Netherlands. Officials also stated that these rumors arose from the Dutch government's announcement of a special defense plan and the sudden slowdown in traffic between The Hague and Berlin. The general tense atmosphere created by German propaganda activities in the past three days is also the basis for the rumor-mongers. (Associated Press, 8th)</p>
<h3>The Netherlands Takes Precautions, Continues to Draft Naval Reservists, Cancels Soldiers' Leave, Blocks Shipping, and Strictly Controls Telephone Communication with Foreign Countries</h3>
<p>The Hague - Yesterday, the government drafted naval reservists from the 1927 and 1928 classes, coinciding with the cancellation of leave for the army, navy, and air force. Some reservists have been ordered to report to the Rotterdam naval headquarters immediately, while others assigned to coastal defense are to report to the Amsterdam naval headquarters. Reservists should also be prepared with full equipment. Officials refused to explain the cancellation of soldiers' leave and the drafting of reservists, only saying that the tense international situation requires neutral countries located among belligerent countries to be prepared for unexpected events at any time. They pointed out that a sudden war will occur in Europe within these few days. Informed circles said that they believed there would be a fierce air battle between Britain and Germany, which would further endanger the status of neutral countries. No facts increasing the direct crisis in the Netherlands have been obtained yet; these measures are just precautionary. (Associated Press, 8th)</p>
<p>The Hague - According to the Director of Shipping, the ports of the Meuse and Rhine rivers will be closed from the 11th to the 13th of this month, prohibiting any ships from entering or leaving. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<p>The Hague - After the military authorities canceled leave for officers and soldiers, officers and soldiers who are currently on leave have already begun to return to their units to cancel their leave. The order is very good. National railway transportation has been dedicated to military use. The number of troops mobilized this time will be unprecedented in Dutch history, and the national economic life will inevitably be affected. As for the preventive measures taken by the navy, they are even more active than the army. Even merchant sailors and fishermen are being drafted. In addition, telephone communication between the Netherlands and foreign countries has been strictly controlled by the authorities, and it was interrupted once from 10:30 pm yesterday to 8:00 am today. According to a "Commercial Report" editorial, the Dutch nation must be prepared to cope with any event and freely take various measures at any time. The Netherlands does not need foreign assistance. (Havas)</p>
<h3>Belgium Prepares for the Worst</h3>
<p>Brussels - Regarding the news of the Netherlands' decision to cancel military leave and cut off transportation, Belgium has paid close attention to it. However, Belgium does not intend to take the same measures, because Belgium is confident that its army is sufficient to repel invading enemy troops. Generally, it is determined that a decisive event will occur within days, but the location of its occurrence is guessed differently by everyone. (Haitong, 8th)</p>

<h3>Measures to Suppress Prices to be Implemented by Authorities, Hoarding and Price Gouging Will Be Punished Severely, Efforts to Adjust Food Prices, Price Stabilization Committee of the French Concession Holds General Meeting Today</h3>
<p>Since the tightening of foreign exchange on the 2nd of this month, speculators have uniformly raised market prices for domestic products, affecting the livelihood of civilians. According to a member of the Price Stabilization Committee of the French Concession, the Price Stabilization Committee has paid close attention to the high prices of various merchants. Specific measures for price suppression have been drafted by the members of the various subcommittees and will be passed at tomorrow's (9th) general meeting, and then they can be consulted with the Public Concession for implementation. The Price Stabilization Committee has been established for two months, and there have been several cases where merchants have been found to have raised prices after review by the Price Stabilization Committee. They have been fined or warned separately, but their store names have not been published temporarily in order to protect their business reputation. However, if they continue to do evil, further punishment will be given. A member also said that merchants often use the cost of re-purchasing goods as an excuse to refuse to sell, which is not allowed. Therefore, although the exchange rate is tight at this time, there is still the possibility of releasing it in the future. Moreover, the goods that have been purchased are priced when the exchange rate is stable, so it should not be arbitrarily raised. Regarding these main food items, such as rice and coal, because the foreign exchange is a price stabilization price, there are indeed considerable difficulties, but we should always do our best to adjust them. For example, the coal used by the coal industry has been agreed with the Kai Coal Company to supply it at cost price.</p>
<p>Citizens' Suggestions: The Citizens' Federation of the First Special District of this city yesterday approved the following suggestions: The prices of all things are expensive, although they are affected by the war, but the conclusion of the matter lies in the fact that most of them are caused by speculators colluding with certain circles to hoard and monopolize. When the exchange rate rises slightly, the goods purchased in foreign exchange, or when the goods are scarce, are all purchased in large quantities and stacked in warehouses, and then rumors are spread in all directions, either saying that the foreign exchange fund is shaking, or saying that the source of the goods will be cut off. Various circles mistakenly believe it to be true, and one person tells ten, and ten people tell a hundred, and the price of the goods immediately rises. Cunning merchants hide all kinds of goods and hoard them, and well-off families rush to buy and prepare them, even accumulating goods that can be used for more than a year and a half. In less than half a day, the market is empty. The poor workers who work hard all day long, when they return home in the evening and want to buy a few necessities such as rice and coal briquettes, have to run more than ten miles and spend several hours, and still return empty-handed. They have to buy large cakes to fill their stomachs, or split furniture for cooking. Although there are establishments for selling at discounted prices, the time for selling at discounted prices is when the workers are working in the factory, so how can they come in person? If there are old, weak, and young people in the family who go to buy at discounted prices, they have to stand for three or four hours. How can the old, weak, and young people with faces like vegetables endure long-term crowding, and even be injured and fall to the ground? Alas, the hard-working civilians are often cut off from food and cooking, and the hateful speculators have become rich people! Please invite various public groups to organize a price stabilization committee as soon as possible. Its work should first treat the symptoms and then treat the root cause. There are six methods for treating the symptoms: (1) If a person hoards goods and is reported by someone, and the facts are verified, whether it is a warehouse receipt or spot goods, they must be distributed for sale at discounted prices. The payment for the goods will be donated to charitable activities, except for a certain amount to be given as a bonus to the reporter. (2) Anyone who is not a merchant who buys a large amount of goods will be considered hoarding. In short, except for luxury goods, buying too much goods will be subject to the same punishment. (3) After the establishment of the Price Stabilization Committee, all whole goods, if they are concealed or reported less, will be considered hoarding. (4) The names of the owners, the number of goods, and the storage locations of the goods that have long been mortgaged by various banks or stacked in various warehouses must be notified to the association for registration. (5) Goods that have not been approved by the association must not be used as collateral by various banks, and various warehouses are not allowed to store them. If there is a violation of items four and five, it will be considered helping hoarding. (6) Consult with the consuls of various countries to notify the overseas Chinese of their respective countries that they must not protect hoarders or store goods for them. If there is a violation, consult with the officials of that country to handle it in accordance with the penalty rules of our Price Stabilization Committee. If the above six methods can be followed, even if speculators have all kinds of insidious tricks, they will not be able to use their skills.</p>
<p>Rice Industry Resolution: The two associations of the bean and rice industry, grocery and oil cake industry in this city held a joint meeting of the supervisory committee of the two associations at the association's headquarters at 3:30 pm yesterday to discuss ways to restrict speculative activities, in accordance with the intention of the two concession authorities to "adjust food to relieve the people's difficulties," and invited representatives of the Rice Market Management Committee to attend to exchange views and cooperate closely. The resolutions are as follows:</p>
<p>Limit Period for Clearing: "The transaction of rice and grain should be based on actual sales as a principle, and must follow the proper order, that is, customers sell to shops, and shops sell to businesses, and must not overstep the rules, which has long been stipulated in the market trading rules. Recently, a small number of people have been buying and selling foreign rice, and do not follow this regulation, transferring and receiving each other, without any restrictions, which is enough to disrupt market prices and affect people's livelihood, which is really wrong. The two associations hereby convened a joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees to discuss rectification measures. It is believed that the reason why the above situation occurs is due to the excessive length of the delivery period and the delay in delivery. It has been decided that in order to crack down on speculation outside the industry and eliminate short selling, from the 10th of this month, whether it is domestic rice or foreign rice (with 160 catties as a unit), the payment must be made with the bill of lading within five days from the date of transaction at the latest, and the goods must be weighed and cleared within ten days. Otherwise, the foreign rice will be paid in full according to the original weight on the English book, and the Hong Kong rice and domestic rice will be paid in full according to the cost list. However, for fear that the weight may be insufficient when weighing, the seller will deduct two catties per bag to compensate the buyer.</p>
<p>Facilitate Retail Sales: For goods traded before the 10th of this month, except for the payment period in accordance with the regulations, they must all be weighed and cleared before the 20th of this month, otherwise they will be handled in accordance with the above regulations. In order to facilitate the retail sale of foreign rice, the industry is notified that if there are transactions of thirty to fifty bags, they should also be sold, but if the payment must be made before weighing, the seller may issue a delivery voucher. In addition to the announcement, the above resolutions will also be reported to the authorities of the two concessions for record.</p>
<h3>British Army East Surrey Regiment War Fund</h3>
<p>Concert at the Lyceum Theatre, proceeds from ticket sales remitted to England</p>
<p>The East Surrey Regiment of the British Defense Force stationed in Shanghai will hold a concert at the Lyceum Theatre at 9:15 pm this Saturday, and the proceeds from ticket sales will be remitted to the home country to fund the British wartime central fund.</p>
<h3>Do Not Forget the National Humiliation of May 9th, Citizens Will Stop Entertainment and Banquets Today, Practice Thrift, Relief, and National Construction Savings</h3>
<p>Today is the "May 9th" National Humiliation Memorial Day. The Central Government originally intended this memorial day to make the public not forget the Japanese people's ambition to invade China, but since the July 7th Incident, the whole country has been in the process of resisting the war, and it has been stipulated that July 7th is the Anti-Japanese War Memorial Day. Therefore, it has been decided to abolish this "May 9th" National Humiliation Memorial Day. In this special environment, all walks of life in this city have not been extravagant in the past two years, and only spiritually commemorate this festival. Now that the Central Government has explicitly ordered the abolition, it has been decided to stop all unnecessary activities, but automatically stop entertainment and banquets to show that we do not forget the national humiliation, and at the same time practice thrift, relief, and national construction savings.</p>
<h3>Chambers of Commerce and Others Received a Telegram from the Ministry of Finance Resolving to Maintain Monetary Confidence, the Exchange Market is Becoming More Stable, Public Bonds are Becoming More Popular, and the Run on Deposits Has Completely Subsided</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Bankers' Association, and the Money Dealers' Association received a telegram from the Ministry of Finance yesterday, reiterating their determination to maintain monetary confidence and stabilize finance. As for the restriction on withdrawals, there is no such thing. The original telegram was seen in yesterday's (8th) newspaper and will not be repeated here.</p>
<p>The Exchange Market is Easing and People's Hearts are Settled: A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency learned from the financial market yesterday that the black market for foreign exchange in Shanghai yesterday, HSBC Bank's listing price remained unchanged, and the actual transaction price was easing. The dark market for gold and foreign currencies has stabilized, the stock market is slightly bullish, unified bonds are slightly popular, cotton yarn, rice, oil, and foreign stocks have all fallen back, and the Ministry of Finance's telegram to Shanghai declaring its determination to maintain the monetary system, stabilize finance, and restrict deposits has completely quelled the rumors and stabilized people's hearts. The run on deposits in various banks and shops has completely subsided.</p>
<p>The Lucky Speculation Needs to Be Corrected: In fact, today's Shanghai has lost its position as the national financial center. Under the control of evil forces, the public listing price of foreign exchange in the local area is no longer a true and fair listing price. Moreover, the rise and fall of the exchange rate is no longer subject to economic forces. The buying and selling of foreign exchange is just the game of speculators. On the one hand, it is encouraged by rumors, and on the other hand, it follows this group of people to the place, suddenly shrinking, then collecting all the strength, and suddenly growing, then dumping everything out. Merchants are bystanders, so the market in Shanghai has become a gambling place for speculators.</p>
<h3>Yesterday Was Mother's Day</h3>
<p>Yesterday, "May 8th" was International Mother's Day. Women's groups throughout the city, in view of the importance of maternal education, at this time of war and national construction, in the autumn of national calamity, children's education is extremely important. Only with a good mother can there be excellent citizens, who can later shoulder the responsibility of serving the country. However, due to the special environment, women in the city are encouraged to educate their children not only for the tradition of their own families, but also to know that the children now are the masters of the country in the future. Being a mother, recognizing the meaning of educating children, is to create talents for the country and society, and to work hard for the country and society. We should also correct unreasonable traditional concepts, cultivate the modern mother's love needed, eradicate family thoughts, earnestly take on the responsibility of educating children for the country and society, and strictly teach them in order to cultivate promising young people, fight for freedom and glory for the country and society, and fight for liberation and survival for the nation and the country.</p>
<h3>Ships from Shanghai to Other Ports Must Be Subject to Quarantine Restrictions</h3>
<p>The weather in this city has suddenly become very cool since yesterday, and the sunlight is uncertain. It has been found that infectious diseases such as smallpox are quite prevalent recently. Ships from Shanghai to other ports must be subject to quarantine restrictions.</p>
<h3>New US Consul General in Shanghai, Lockehead, Arrives in Shanghai, Scheduled to Return to the US for Vacation on the 14th, Will Return to Shanghai in Early Autumn</h3>
<p>The English "Great American Evening News" said that the new US Consul General in Shanghai, Lockehead, returned to Shanghai on the 9th on the British transport ship "Henderson", and will take the President Coolidge ship to the United States for vacation with his wife on the 14th. His son is studying at Princeton University and will graduate this summer. Mr. and Mrs. Lockehead will attend the graduation ceremony. It is expected that Mr. and Mrs. Lockehead will return to Shanghai in early autumn. Other foreigners who will take the President Coolidge ship back to the United States include Mrs. Heard, wife of the Commander of the US Asiatic Fleet, and her two daughters, the Mexican chargé d'affaires Amado and his family, etc.</p>
<h3>Young and Strong Refugees Are All Dispersed</h3>
<p>Limited to the end of this month, the required cost is 300,000 yuan</p>
<p>The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association is responsible for supplying food to refugees in various places in the city. Due to soaring prices, it feels very difficult. In order to save expenses, after discussion with various charities, it is actively dispersing young and strong refugees. Such as the Shanghai International Relief Committee, the Tzu Lien General Association and its branches, and the first reception center directly under the association entrusted to the Salvation Army, all started to handle it last month, or have been dispersed, or are still in progress. It is reported that the association yesterday also notified various refugee shelters that refugees, except for the old, weak, disabled, widows, and orphans, should all leave the center before May 31, in order to leave 20,000 refugees. Each person will be given a dispersal fee of 15 yuan, which requires a total dispersal fee of 300,000 yuan, all of which will be paid by the association. At the same time, the remaining old, weak, disabled, widows, orphans, and those who have no home and no ability to produce will have to be kept for a long time. The number of people is still difficult to determine. Therefore, the association authorities still hope that benevolent people will push clothes to feed and continue to sponsor.</p>
<h3>Japanese Fleet Commander Shimada Takes Office</h3>
<p>The position of Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Navy in China has recently been reassigned to Vice Admiral Shigetaro Shimada. Shimada went to the flagship "Izumo" in the Huangpu River at 8:30 am on the 7th to formally complete the handover with the outgoing Commander-in-Chief, Admiral Koshirō Oikawa, and immediately took office, and issued the following statement: "The blockade of the transportation of Chinese public and private ships along the coast of China implemented by the former Commander-in-Chief of the China Fleet, Oikawa, will be continued by this Commander-in-Chief after noon on May 7, 'Showa 15'."</p>
<h3>Consumables and Luxury Goods Are Prohibited from Being Transported to the Mainland</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Government, in order to reduce the outflow of funds from the mainland and maintain the anti-Japanese economic warfare, has ordered the Ningbo Shipping Management Office to comply with the regulations that all items not needed in the mainland, such as perfume, monosodium glutamate, and fruit, are not allowed to be imported.</p>
<h3>The Poor Children's School Relief Center Broadcasts for Donations</h3>
<p>Today, radio stations throughout the city will broadcast special solicitation programs</p>
<p>The Poor Children's School Relief Center in this city has been established for more than two years. Recently, the cost of education for twenty district volunteer primary and secondary schools and more than 1,500 relief students has been greatly affected by abnormal prices, and it is becoming increasingly large. In addition to the National Relief Commission allocating 10,000 yuan from Chongqing to consolidate the relief fund, it has been approved by the Broadcasting Radio Administration and the Public Concession Police Department, and has received enthusiastic assistance from more than ten groups including the Shanghai Private Radio Industry Association and the Shanghai Recreation Association. On May 9, all radio stations throughout the city were ordered to stop broadcasting and only broadcast the center's solicitation program, so that people across the country could listen and the center could stand firm and flourish.</p>
<h3>Danish Ship "Afrika" Captured in Colón, Many Passengers and Goods from This City Aboard, British Prize Court Has Opened Trial</h3>
<p>Denmark and Norway, due to the expansion of the European war, Norwegian merchant ships once suspended sailing. After the Norwegian Minister to the United Kingdom negotiated with the British government, Norwegian ships sailed in accordance with British and French wartime rules and obeyed the command of the British Navy. Therefore, they have resumed sailing. Denmark has complied with Germany, resulting in the suspension of overseas trade. Ships that have stopped sailing in the Far East have been captured by the British Navy, and most of them are concentrated in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Captured and on Trial</p>
<p>It is now heard that the Danish merchant ship "Afrika", managed by Silong Trading Company, came to the Far East from Denmark via Sweden and other ports and arrived at the port of Colón. Just as Denmark was changing, the ship was detained by the British Navy. There were a large number of goods on board transported to Shanghai. After the detention, the goods could not be transported to their destination. The customers in this city who had goods loaded on the ship were very shocked to hear the news of the detention. Recently, it was learned that after the ship was detained in Colón, it has been tried by the British Prize Court several times. The goods on board belong to neutral country customers, so the Colón manager of the ship hired a lawyer to appear in court to defend the customers loading the goods.</p>
<p>Merchant Registration</p>
<p>Baolong Trading Company in this city has received a telegram from Colón, hiring a famous lawyer named Creas. Customers loading goods who need to defend themselves should telegraph the Colón manager for registration before the 15th of this month. Baolong Trading Company has notified customers in this city yesterday and printed an English letter with detailed methods. If there are customers with goods loaded on the ship who have not received the notification, they can read it at the company. As for the goods on board, they will still be stored in the ship and at the customer's convenience. Regarding the loss of this time, it will be handled in accordance with the terms of the bill of lading. The shipowner declares that he is not responsible for anything. It is not yet possible to estimate whether the ship will be permanently detained there or sailed to other ports for mooring.</p>
<h3>French Chief Inspector Pu Lansi Goes to Vietnam to Serve the Country, He Left Shanghai Yesterday Morning to Board a Ship, French Consul General Gives Him an Honorary Certificate</h3>
<p>Lieutenant Colonel Pu Lansi, the Chief Inspector of the French Concession Police Department, set off for Vietnam yesterday (8th) morning. Pu will now assist in military affairs in the army in Vietnam. French Consul General Bao Daizhi, in order to reward Pu for his past achievements, presented him with a highly honorary certificate when Pu set off for Vietnam, stating: "For three years, Pu has used his courageous spirit and power to make the police force achieve satisfactory results in the ideal, adding great glory to France. Now Pu leaves the police force to defend the motherland, which is worthy of being an example for us." Pu also received a certificate from Colonel Que Gao Mi in November 1937, which stated: "Lieutenant Pu has been in office for five years, especially during the Shanghai Incident, with his courageous spirit and transcendent wisdom, leading by example and being loyal to his duties, which is worthy of praise." In March 1938, Pu also received a certificate from the French Consul General, which shows that Pu is generally valued by his superiors.</p>
<h3>Coal Briquette Sale at Reduced Prices</h3>
<p>Large Coal Briquette Factories Implement Price Reduction Immediately</p>
<p>Since the price of coal briquettes skyrocketed to $9.40 per load, ordinary people have been unable to bear the burden, causing widespread anxiety. In light of the public outcry, major coal briquette factories, including Guo, Nanyang, and Dongfang, have voluntarily reduced or sold coal briquettes at lower prices. These factories began sales yesterday. The Yi Tai Xing Coal Briquette Factory, Nanyang Coal Briquette Factory, and Yuan Yuan Coal Briquette Company have also decided to sell at reduced prices.</p>

<h3>Far East British Ships Awaiting Requisition</h3>
<p>Yee Long Company's Shen Guang Vessel to be Requisitioned and Sail to Hong Kong</p>
<p>To meet wartime needs, the British government has requisitioned several British ships in the Far East and sent them to Hong Kong and British territories in Southeast Asia for use. Since the first of this month, to facilitate requisitioning at any time, Jardine Matheson was ordered to keep all its ships operating in the Far East, except those on the Yangtze River route, ready for requisition. It is understood that all British merchant ships operating in the Far East are now subject to the same restrictions. Yesterday, it was learned that the British Yee Long Shipping Company was recently ordered to requisition ships. The company's Shen Guang vessel is reportedly to be requisitioned and sail to Hong Kong. It has now returned to Shanghai to await orders. The departure date has not yet been determined.</p>
<h3>Paper Merchants Take the Opportunity to Raise Prices</h3>
<p>Since the recent fluctuations in the black market exchange rate in this city, speculative merchants have taken the opportunity to raise prices. The price of paper has been rising constantly, especially white paper, which has jumped from over $30 per ream to nearly $50. This has greatly threatened the publishing industry in this city. Yesterday, a member of the paper industry told a reporter from the Ping Ming News Agency that the paper used in this city, except for a small amount of domestically produced paper such as maobian paper from Fujian, is mostly imported from Germany and Norway. Even the paper produced by paper mills in this city depends on foreign countries for pulp. Therefore, the rise in paper prices after the exchange rate decline is only natural. However, the sudden price increase is purely due to speculators hoarding and some paper merchants taking the opportunity to raise prices. Shipments ordered from foreign firms have been arriving in Shanghai continuously recently, and these orders were placed months ago, which has nothing to do with the recent black market exchange rate fluctuations. In addition, warehouses in this city are full of paper. The paper sold on the market now is all old stock, so there is no reason for price increases. However, manufacturers and shops are treating their goods as rare commodities and limiting each customer to no more than two reams of white paper, seemingly indicating a shortage of goods to deliberately raise prices. The hearts of these unscrupulous merchants are truly appalling.</p>
<h3>Fujian Fellow-Provincials Association Begins Recruiting Members</h3>
<p>The Fujian Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai is recruiting new members for this year, starting on the first of this month. Although there are no accurate statistics, it is estimated that there are about 200,000 Fujianese living in Shanghai. The association's activities, such as promoting education, industry, charity, and hygiene, and promoting economic mutual assistance, have been successful. Its refugee relief efforts after the war have been particularly effective. The association expects a very positive response to this recruitment drive.</p>
<h3>Fire on Touth Island, Wusongkou</h3>
<p>According to the English-language "China Press", a fire broke out in the rear residential buildings of the Guanghua Oil Company on Touth Island, Wusongkou, just after 10 PM last night (the 7th). Twelve residences were completely destroyed, but no casualties were reported. The water fire brigade rushed to the scene after receiving the alarm, but the wind fanned the flames, making them extremely intense and impossible to extinguish. Fortunately, the Guanghua Oil Company did not have oil stored when the fire broke out, otherwise the losses would have been even greater. It is learned that the island and its buildings, including the residential buildings and the Guanghua Oil Company's buildings, have been occupied by the Japanese army. However, the Japanese soldiers were unable to put out the fire.</p>

<h3>Sharp Drop in Value of Japanese Currency - Japanese Government Displays Signs of Unease - Sharp Changes in Exchange Market Hurt the Japanese Themselves - Smear Campaign Against Legal Tender Fails to Achieve Results</h3>
<p>Since the violent shock to the Shanghai exchange market on the 2nd, Japanese newspapers have been exaggerating and sensationalizing the events, fabricating slanders against the value of legal tender to the extreme. However, according to a certain economist, this kind of wishful thinking that China will fail has completely forgotten that they themselves are deeply mired in a quagmire.</p>
<p>Facts Prove Rumors Are False</p>
<p>(1) The authorities' suspension of black market foreign exchange supply in Shanghai this time is entirely an expedient measure to prevent the Japanese from massive arbitrage and is unavoidable. It is not the government's intention to have speculators fuel the flames. Fortunately, all parties have remained calm, and after a few days, the storm has subsided. (2) The government has telegraphed the Chamber of Commerce and the Bankers' Association, declaring its determination to maintain currency credibility and stabilize finance. All rumors of restrictions on withdrawals, etc., are fabricated by speculators and traitors. Japanese admonitions have been refuted without even attacking them.</p>
<p>Decline in Japanese Currency Affects Exports</p>
<p>The current turmoil has caused the price of Japanese currency in China to fall, which has increased the cost of materials from the occupied areas needed by Japanese domestic industries. The selling price of products cannot but be increased, which is a huge obstacle to its foreign exports and increases the difficulty of absorbing foreign exchange. According to a telegram from the Tokyo branch of the Shanghai Continental News, the Japanese Ministry of Finance is extremely concerned about this and is considering using the funds originally set up for the import of materials from the one-yen group area for adjustment purposes, in order to prevent the rising cost of importing materials from the occupied areas from causing a new trend of price increases for Japanese domestic industrial products. However, those familiar with Japan's financial situation and the inside story of this fund observe that this consideration by the Japanese Ministry of Finance is strong in desire but weak in ability and is unlikely to become a reality. It can be seen that the sharp changes in the exchange market have already caused the Japanese to suffer, and it proves the success of China's policy. In addition, the Japanese have greatly exaggerated the decline in the exchange rate of legal tender, saying that it is due to the depletion of the equalization fund. A reporter from the Da Zhong News Agency asked a certain important figure in the financial community about this rumor, who said: The equalization fund consists of 5 million pounds jointly contributed by HSBC and Mercantile Bank of the British side and 5 million pounds jointly contributed by the Bank of Communications and the Central Bank of the Chinese side. The equalization fund is governmental in nature. It purchases legal tender foreign exchange when the exchange rate is too high and sells it when it is too low in order to stabilize the market. We can understand this by considering the literal meaning of "equalization".</p>
<p>Fund Depletion is Pure Fabrication</p>
<p>The participation of HSBC and Mercantile Bank in the equalization fund is still commercial in nature technically, but their funds are guaranteed by the Chinese and British governments. Therefore, the two banks are still operating within the scope of business while stabilizing foreign exchange. For example, when the European war broke out last autumn, a large amount of capital that had fled in the past flowed back to Shanghai. If it were not for HSBC's healthy appetite, the exchange rate would have soared to seven or eight pence at one point. Understanding that the equalization fund has inflows and outflows, it can be known that the statement of fund depletion is pure fabrication.</p>
<p>The Decline in Japanese Currency is Even Stronger in This City</p>
<p>The statement by Japanese newspapers that legal tender is about to collapse is a fabrication and slander. Before the Japanese open their mouths, they should ask themselves about the value of their own currency, instead of making such outrageous statements. Taking North China as an example, the value of "United Reserve Certificates" within the Tianjin concession is still lower than that of legal tender. If "United Reserve Certificates" are remitted to Shanghai, a discount of about 20% is required to exchange for 100 yuan of legal tender. In this city, the Japanese currency not only declined along with the legal tender, but its rate of decline was even greater than that of legal tender. In order to prevent the Japanese puppets from arbitrage and using legal tender to purchase materials overseas, the government has had to let the exchange rate float to its natural level. If artificial methods are used to prevent it, it will not only waste foreign exchange funds, but it will also be tantamount to supplying the Japanese with supplies.

<h3>In the Case of the Assassination of Wu Qilun, the Criminals Falsely Implicate Others - Gu Zhuxuan Denies Instigating the Crime</h3>
<p>Gu Zhuxuan and his apprentices Qiao Yaoshan, Zheng Changchun, etc., were implicated as instigators and abettors by the actual assassins of lawyer Wu Qilun, Xia Guifu, Wei Shulin, Wang Xingfang, Xia Shoufeng, etc. They were arrested by the police and charged with instigating murder. Presiding Judge Feng of the First Special Court conducted a preliminary hearing of the criminals, but due to time constraints, a detailed hearing could not be held and was postponed to another date. Details of the hearing have already been reported in the newspapers. Yesterday afternoon at 2:30, Judge Feng reopened the</p>
<p>Criminal Court for Further Hearing</p>
<p>According to Gu Zhuxuan's testimony, "Qiao and Zheng are not actually my students. They are polite to me and call me 'You Sheng' when they meet me. These ignorant people are arrested and cling tightly to me innocently. I don't know what their intentions are. Wu Qilun and I have been friends for more than ten years. He likes to sing operas very much. When I invite actors and actresses to banquets, Wu is in charge of the reception. I usually have Wu Qilun handle all civil and criminal cases for people. Apart from the time he spends in court handling cases, it can be said that he never goes anywhere else. He likes to sit with me in the</p>
<p>Living Room and Talk</p>
<p>My relationship with him is so good that people who live in Shanghai know it perfectly well and have no ill feelings. Why would I commit a crime and incite someone to kill him? There is one more thing I would like to ask the court to do. Summon Wu Qilun's elder brother and his son to court to question them. I paid for Wu Qilun's funeral expenses entirely. If I had killed him, would I still be taking care of these matters? As for my case in the French Concession, Wu Qilun was not my lawyer at all. Whether he put in effort or not has nothing to do with me. As for the case of Qiu Changyin confirming guardianship, it is said that the Qiu family paid me 31,000 yuan in mediation fees, which I did not share with Wu Qilun, causing Wu to damage my reputation outside. This is also</p>
<p>A Joke</p>
<p>I only saw this case in the newspaper. I never participated in the mediation. Where did this huge mediation fee come from? In short, I am now completely wronged by them. I request the court to allow me to propose witnesses who are beneficial to the defendant for questioning so that the truth can be revealed. Even Shen Yufei (a suspect in the bombing of a newspaper office), a prisoner in the same cell as me, said that Qiao Yaoshan was with them for several days. According to Shen, they are completely implicating me out of malice. The court verified the confession and ordered all defendants to be remanded in custody. The hearing was adjourned to the 15th of this month, pending the arrival of the Western Detective Chief for further questioning. Court adjourned at 5:40 PM.</p>
<h3>Qing Yu Li Case - Appeals Rejected</h3>
<p>Regarding the houses in Qing Yu Li, Chongqing Road, contracted by the Shanghai Women's Bank, the bank and the Poor Children's Education Institute (the owner of the houses) had a contract requiring the houses to be rebuilt before January 1, 1939. Otherwise, the bank would be subject to a fine of more than 200,000 yuan. Therefore, in July 1938, the bank filed a lawsuit in the First Special Court against all the tenants of the Qing Yu Li, requesting them to vacate the houses. After three trials, the tenants lost the case. During the period of enforcement negotiations, the Women's Bank partially built fences and began demolishing houses. The tenants repeatedly tore down the fences, leading to criminal lawsuits. Later, the tenants suddenly obtained new evidence: a contract between the Women's Bank and the Poor Children's Education Institute to extend the rebuilding period. They hired lawyer Yuan Yang'an to file a petition for retrial with the Second Branch of the High Court and applied for a stay of execution. The court ruled to overturn the original three trials, and the tenants, Ping Jin'ya, etc., were granted an extension until December 1940 to return the houses to the Women's Bank. Over 3,000 tenants were able to live in peace. The Women's Bank appealed to the Supreme Court, disagreeing with the ruling. The tenants also filed a cross-appeal. The Supreme Court has now upheld the judgment of the Second Trial, dismissing both appeals. The litigation costs are to be borne by each party.</p>
<h3>Editors of Registered Books, Newspapers, and Magazines Must Submit Photos</h3>
<p>The News Agency reports that the Public and Concession Police Department has stipulated that all books, newspapers, and magazines published within the concession that apply for registration with the department must submit two two-inch photos of the editor in addition to filling out the form for verification. Those who have already registered with the department must also submit the editor's photos within days.</p>
<h3>No Clues in the Xie Zhitin Assassination Case</h3>
<p>According to the Shanghai Times, the assassination that occurred in front of the Metropole Ballroom on Gordon Road late on the 6th of this month, in which Xie Zhitin, 55 years old, died, remains without clues as to the identity of the assassin as of yesterday (the 7th). It is widely believed that the case was politically motivated. According to Japanese sources, Xie originally worked at the Shanghai branch of Citibank. He later served as a "financial advisor" to the "Reformed Government" in Nanjing and as the chairman of the "Central China Fisheries Company" and a "director of the China Prosperity Bank." On the night of the 6th, Xie was at a banquet in the Broadway Mansions. On his way back to his residence at 72 Dunxin Road, he was shot in a vital area by three or four assailants and killed when he passed the Metropole Ballroom. In addition, it is reported that the victim in the bloodshed that occurred in front of the Metropole Ballroom on Gordon Road on the evening of the 6th of this month was Xie Zhitin, a senior official of the "Consolidated Tax Bureau." Xie's real name was Yonghong, and Zhitin was his courtesy name. The previous report stating Xie's name as Qingmo was incorrect. Xie's body has been examined by a prosecutor dispatched by the Prosecutor's Office of the First Special Court, who confirmed that Xie was assassinated. The body has been ordered to be claimed.</p>

<h3>Strike at British Xiangtai Timber Mill Leads to Fatalities - Three Workers Killed and Wounded in Brawl</h3>
<p>A strike broke out at the British-owned Xiangtai Timber Mill at 1126 East Yangshupu Road at around 9 AM yesterday, resulting in fatalities. Three workers were killed and wounded. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Strike Resolved</p>
<p>Xiangtai Timber Mill was founded by a British merchant. It is a well-funded enterprise with a long history, employing over 1,500 workers, including over 500 in the sawing section. Recently, due to soaring prices and difficult living conditions, the workers demanded improved treatment from the factory. The labor representatives, led by Li Fengqi (45 years old, from Ningbo), presented conditions to the factory. After several consultations between labor and management representatives, and a compromise on the amount of rice subsidies, a resolution was reached.</p>
<p>A Brawl</p>
<p>However, the labor representatives suspected Li of favoring the management and expressed dissatisfaction. At approximately 9:10 AM yesterday, over 500 workers in the sawing section held differing opinions. Initially, there were only disputes, which then escalated into violence. They wielded iron bars and other weapons, engaging in mutual attacks. The mill's manager immediately reported the incident to the Yangshupu Police Station, which dispatched armed police in patrol cars to suppress the violence and disperse the rioting workers, maintaining order.</p>
<p>Three Killed and Wounded</p>
<p>During the worker brawl, Song Yougen, a coal and firewood contractor from Ningbo, was struck in the buttocks. Worker Wang Linsheng was injured in the head. Labor representative Li Fengqi suffered a severe head injury from an iron bar striking his right temple, and his breathing was faint. An ambulance was summoned to the scene, and the three injured were sent to Hudong Hospital for treatment. Li Fengqi died shortly afterward due to his severe injuries. The police are investigating the cause of the strike and tracking down the perpetrators for prosecution.</p>

<h3>Letter to All Students in Shanghai from the University and Middle School Students' Friendship Association (4)</h3>
<p>We must severely condemn those who sell out the nation and state, their acts of treason, and the secret agreements they sign, which are much more detrimental than the usual national traitors and the Twenty-One Demands. "Poverty cannot make one move; force cannot make one yield." Surrender-style peace is treason. We must never submit to their threats and inducements. From today onwards, we must continue the spirit of the May Fourth Movement and express our conviction with resolute actions. On the one hand, we must study diligently; on the other hand, we must always keep in mind that in our struggle against resistance and nation-building, we should firmly believe that the Three Principles of the People are the highest and supreme guiding political path for us, and the program of resistance and nation-building is the only national policy we adhere to. Of course, we will not act rashly, but we will never forget our sacred mission. Under the principle of "studying without forgetting to save the country, saving the country without forgetting to study," we must keep the following points in mind: (1) We must pursue the truth of resistance and nation-building from school life. (2) We must build our bright and brilliant future from the spirit of hard work, self-improvement, and struggle. (3) We demand regular and reasonable activities. (4) We must strengthen our spiritual fortress. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Public Exhibition Cup Successfully Concludes; China Youth Wins Tenth Championship in a Row; Yan Hua Group Wins Without Effort; Zhu Sun Group Narrowly Loses; Final Week Nine Against Six; Overall Result Two Against One</h3>
<p>The tenth Public Exhibition Cup handball tournament successfully concluded last night. In last night's main doubles battle, the Western Youth team, with the overall situation already decided, lacked the ability to turn the tide, and their morale was greatly diminished. The first doubles team of M. Krepling and Jeb Meng actually forfeited, so Hua Fenggang and Yan Peiqiu won without effort. In the first doubles, China Youth's ball king Zhu Kuan and veteran Sun Shisheng cooperated, facing off against Western Youth's alliance leader F. Krepling and Hua Mu. Zhu and Sun were in excellent form, versatile, and full of vigor in both offense and defense. However, Hua, relying purely on strength, was ultimately outmaneuvered by Zhu and Sun, who relied on strategy. However, Zhu and Sun, finding it difficult to compete in strength and because China Youth had already secured victory, did not engage in a fierce battle. The tenth Public Exhibition Cup has now been completely declared over. China Youth has won the championship in a row. With the exception of the first four championships, which were won by the Western Youth team, China Youth has now won six consecutive championships.</p>

<h3>Finance: Foreign Exchange Gradually Stabilizing</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no change in HSBC's posted rates. The black market for British and American exchange rates was stable with a hint of firmness, a very mediocre situation, caused by the uneven transactions of operators and a reduction in speculation. The morning opening also reported that the British rate was flat and the American rate was tight, indeed because exchange rates continued to fall by 0.3625, and the unprecedented low price of 3.375 yuan was seen again. It was also heard that general short sellers were unwilling to cover their positions, so it was said that the future of the American pound was very difficult to predict. Today, buyers and sellers, speculators, and outsiders mutually supplied and demanded, and the price trended toward looseness in a flat market. The lowest price for the May American exchange rate was 4.53125 yuan. Speculators arbitraged, going long on the spot market and selling the current month's contract, gaining 0.125 US dollars. Calculated over 23 days, the interest was around 0.035. Until the closing, the market lacked change. The closing price for the British exchange rate was 3.34375 pence, and the American exchange rate was 4.6875 yuan, both firmer by 0.003125 compared to the previous day's closing. In terms of futures and spot prices, the convergence became more pronounced.</p>
<p>The British and American exchange rates fell again. At the beginning of the morning, the London telegrams showed that both near-term and far-term contracts fell by 0.0625. The New York silver price remained flat. The London gold price remained unchanged. The exchange rates of the British exchange rate against Shanghai, France, and other exchange rates were all flat. The American exchange rate against the British exchange rate continued to fall sharply by 0.3625. It remained unchanged against Shanghai, and fell by 0.00125 against France. The central government's posted rates for various exchange rates remained the same. The bank's morning opening spot selling prices were 3.3125 pence for the British exchange rate and 4.625 yuan for the American exchange rate, which were flat for the British exchange rate and tight for the American exchange rate by 0.003125 compared to the previous day's evening closing. This was due to the sharp contraction of the exchange rates again. At the same time, the futures opening showed that the American exchange rate was flat and the British exchange rate was loose. After the opening, Chinese speculators still had an appetite, but the intention to supply by outsiders was not bad, so the market immediately showed a slight firmness. It was calculated that outsiders stuffed five duns (monetary units) of American exchange rate at 4.5 yuan to Chinese speculators. The announcement of the HSBC posted rate remained unchanged. The announcement of the white silver equalization tax showed a reduction of 0.5 yuan. After this, speculators once again appeared with the May American exchange rate price at 4.5625 yuan, while outsiders sold spot American exchange rate to Chinese merchants at 4.6875 yuan. Soon after, Chinese banks such as the Shanghai Bank also entered the market to sell. Outsiders had collected the May American exchange rate as low as 4.53125 yuan. Until noon, the market was still stable. As a result, at the closing, the British exchange rate was 3.34375 pence and the American exchange rate was 4.6875 yuan. This month's British exchange rate was 3.25 pence and the American exchange rate was 4.5 yuan, both looser by 0.003125 compared to the closing price yesterday. This month's British exchange rate was longer by 0.009375 and the American exchange rate was firmer by 0.000625. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon.</p>

The Shanghai exchange rate slightly decreased by 0.25 yuan, to 113.5 yuan. The black market for joint banknotes was up by 1.75 yuan, to 101 yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currencies Gradually Rise and Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw British and American gold pounds hovering and trending downward, so the supply was relatively abundant, and the market prices fell by 3 yuan each. British gold notes also fell by 0.5 yuan due to the loosening of the black market British exchange rate. American gold notes initially began at 21.23 yuan due to the continued decline in the pound price, but then rose to 21.095 yuan due to abundant supply. At noon, it was 21.1 yuan, and in the afternoon it fell back to 21 yuan, a decrease of 0.1 yuan compared to the previous day. Hong Kong notes fell following the Hong Kong-Shanghai exchange rates. French franc notes were still in demand, and the market price rose slightly. Singapore and Robi Canada notes were all oversupplied, and the market prices uniformly trended weak. Japanese gold notes also trended lower, with the evening price at 1.2775 yuan. Korean notes suddenly had demand, and the market price rose sharply, with the evening price at 1.0005 yuan.</p>
<h3>Discount Rate Down 25 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday's discount rate for bills of exchange continued to fall sharply. The rate per 1,000 yuan fell from 170 yuan in the morning to 150 yuan. In the afternoon, it was around 145 yuan, a further decrease of 25 yuan compared to the previous day. The call rate of the Money Industry Association remained unchanged, still quoted at 0.25 yuan in both the morning and afternoon markets.</p>
<h3>After Seven Days of Continuous Increases, the Gold Market Began to React Yesterday, Falling Into the 7,000 Yuan Range</h3>
<p>Yesterday's black market for cash gold, after seven days of continuous increases, suddenly reported a reaction, but the downward trend was limited. The long operators were still willing to work hard to maintain it. The market situation was extremely ordinary, and transactions did not appear enthusiastic. This was also because the exchange market had stabilized and the environment lacked stimulation. The morning opening reported a small increase of 40 yuan. It was heard that after the silver houses and gold houses supplied, the money changers sold together. Before long, the price broke below the 7,000 yuan mark, and for a time there were many short positions sold. The lowest price seen was 6,950 yuan. Later, a certain silver house and securities firms, seeing cheap prices, absorbed the long positions, and the price rebounded to 7,050 yuan. However, retail investors suddenly made a settlement at a high price, and the price fell again to 6,980 yuan at the closing. Earlier, thanks to the lifting of the gold houses, it had rebounded slightly, but the silver houses and money changers sold off their long positions, so the result was a closing price of 6,960 yuan, a drop of 100 yuan compared to the previous evening's closing. In the afternoon, the off-market situation turned slightly, and buyers were willing to buy in at 10 yuan higher than the afternoon closing price, but there was still a lack of suppliers, so few transactions were heard. The volume of transactions gradually decreased from busy to quiet, at around 1,800 taels. Gold ornaments in silver shops were quoted at a small increase of 10 yuan. Customs gold and other prices remained flat.</p>
<p>Roasted Red Plum Reduced by 100 Yuan</p>
<p>From the morning, although the initial opening exchange rate for each bar (10 taels) fell, the American exchange rate was slightly tighter, and it soon rebounded, so people's hearts could not be agitated. On the contrary, there were many sellers. The opening was immediately pressed down by a small 40 yuan. The silver houses offered 10 taels to the silver shops for 7,020 yuan. It had stabilized slightly, but soon a certain money changer tended to sell off, and a certain gold house also followed suit, while the foreign exchange rate was stable and firm. Although the silver houses and gold houses took the opportunity to absorb, the long positions ultimately felt abundant, and the price immediately fell by 70 yuan. The money changers offered 10 taels to the silver shops, losing to 6,990 yuan. Then, a certain silver house took advantage of the low price to search for purchases, and the sellers had stopped selling and watched, and there was a rebound of tens of yuan. Later, another silver house relied on tracking and pulling, plus securities firms and money changers competed to buy, and continued to see a rebound of tens of yuan. The gold houses bought 10 taels from the silver houses for 7,050 yuan. However, because the foreign exchange rate was still loose, retail investors inevitably took the opportunity to sell off at a high price, and then went downward again. The money changers sold 20 taels to the gold houses for 6,980 yuan. Later, the gold houses came to drag in, and it saw a rebound of 20 yuan again. The gold houses made mutual transactions of 30 taels for 7,000 yuan. At noon, the silver houses and money changers suddenly sold off their long positions, and the price went downstream again. The silver houses bought a total of 20 taels from the silver shops and other firms for 6,960 yuan as the afternoon closing price. As a result, it fell by 100 yuan compared to the previous day. The rise and fall of 100 yuan in half a day showed that the selling price of the gold houses' own brand of gold was a few yuan higher than the roasted red plum price, and the purchase price was reduced by 20 yuan. The current price of standard gold was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price, and few transactions were made.</p>
<p>Gold Ornaments Quoted at a Small Increase of 10 Yuan</p>
<p>The selling price of gold jewelry in silver shops was initially still 720 yuan for Datong Hang, but at 9:40, it was quoted at a small increase of 10 yuan. Since then, there has been no change. It is estimated that Datong Hang changed the quote to 710 yuan, and the new company's price was the same as the above price. The purchase price was reduced by more than 20 yuan.</p>
<h3>Securities: Domestic Bonds Suddenly Turn Higher Again – Rubber Stocks Finally Soften</h3>
<p>The black market for securities showed an initial decline followed by firmness. There were very few transactions in the morning and more transactions in the afternoon. Market rumors that Song Ziwen was coming to the stage were enough to temporarily stimulate people's hearts, leading to a covering of short positions. The sudden ups and downs of the market were due to the slightly lower price of gold and the looser exchange rate. The volume of transactions in the morning was extremely low. Jianli bought in slightly, and Yichang sold out, and the rest were retail investors trading. In the afternoon, Defu bought in more, and Jiufeng Hongkang sold out, and the market price rose slightly. As a result, it rebounded by 0.01 to 0.03 yuan. The volume of transactions was around 500,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below:</p>
<p>In stock transactions, 20 shares of Huacheng Tobacco Company were traded at a price of 45 yuan each.</p>
<p>The stock market's lack of color was probably due to the Champagne Grand Prix. Although it was only a half-day of business, the volume of transactions was not silent. The trend was slightly soft at the opening, and the buyer's appetite was unusually weak. Later, some famous stocks were bought in at low prices, and the price began to turn firm. There was also a large transaction volume of English Union shares, hovering between 71 and 72 yuan. With the exception of the Sihai Insurance share, the rest were generally slightly lower than the previous closing. This share suddenly jumped to a new high price of 19.7 yuan after opening at the low, and retreated to 0.5 yuan at the closing. The Yihua Defeng share also rebounded. The new share rights traded at 85 yuan, the former closed at a base price of 121 yuan, and the latter at 87 yuan.</p>
<p>Rubber stocks have also, in fact, softened. Transactions were not fresh, and although the price drops were limited, all stocks were difficult to escape. To put it bluntly, the selling pressure was not at all sharp, so the acquisition of generally cheap stocks could not be considered an appropriate activity.</p>
<p>London, 7th (Tuesday) Dispatch: Today, the Chinese foreign debt and the stock market prices of various Far Eastern companies in the British trading house have generally stabilized, and there have been no ups or downs in the market.</p>
<h3>Alma Stock Pays Dividends</h3>
<p>The interim dividend for the year ending September 1940 for Alma Rubber Tree Co., Ltd., managed by the British Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, is 3 yuan per share in national currency, and is scheduled to be distributed on May 22. The interim dividend for this year is subject to the British Malayan government's implementation of foreign exchange control regulations, which stipulate that dividend distributions are limited to one interim and one final dividend each year. The second interim dividend will no longer be distributed.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn: Profits Taken, Yarn Market Slightly Weakened, Shuang Ma (Double Horse) Drops 40 Yuan</h3>
<p>The yarn market is trending weaker, and a declining trend has begun slightly. This is because after several days of significant price increases, it has triggered profit-taking, causing the market to loosen, and the reaction is particularly strong. The amount absorbed by general non-industry participants has always been unwilling to give up. Furthermore, the European situation is still tense, and there are concerns that raw materials may become problematic in the future, resulting in smaller imports and a lack of personnel.</p>
<p>The opening momentum of the yarn market this morning was relatively calm because many long positions were closed, and at the same time, actual demand was not strong. Floating long positions were released. 20-count Shuang Ma fell from 1,665 yuan to 1,647 yuan. According to half-day transaction statistics, 1,496 bales were traded. The market price for 20-count Shuang Ma fell by 40 yuan. The factory uniformly offered 1,000 bales of 23-count Golden Rooster at a price of 1,750 yuan, with credit terms of June-July. Today, 112 pieces of yarn were shipped to Xiamen, and another 945 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong. The amounts purchased by various trading groups are detailed as follows:</p>
<p>Hong Kong: 600; Fellow traders: 870;</p>
<p>Inland: 25; Ningbo: 1</p>
<p>Total: 1,496</p>
<h3>Spot Foreign Cotton: 30-40 Yuan Cheaper than Forward Contracts</h3>
<p>Cotton trading can still be maintained, but those holding goods, seeing the tense situation in Europe, worry that future ship travel may be obstructed and suspended. Therefore, they are optimistic about the rise in cotton prices. The spot cotton transaction situation is listed on the left.</p>
<p>Da Zhong Ji: 291.00</p>
<p>Da Zhong Ji: 312.00</p>
<p>Da Zhong Ji: 38.00</p>
<p>Fellow traders purchase: 600 pieces</p>
<p>Da Zhong Ji: 310.00</p>
<p>Peng Jia Pu: 307.50, 308.00; Fellow traders purchase: 500 pieces</p>
<p>Bai Luo Qu: 303.00; Fellow traders purchase: 100 pieces</p>
<p>Another report states that the foreign cotton market price in New York was quite weak yesterday due to the selling by spot traders and foreign cotton merchants. The closing price fell by five or six British pounds compared to the previous day. India was closed yesterday, and Egypt fell by more than twenty British pounds.</p>
<p>Foreign cotton trading in Shanghai has been more active in recent days, but it is limited to spot transactions. This is because the selling price of spot goods is not as high as the exchange rate price, and its price has not risen enough. It is 30-40 yuan cheaper than futures contracts. However, due to the extremely tight monetary situation, the transaction volume is not very large. The factory prices converted to US dollars at 4.625 yuan yesterday are as follows:</p>
<p>20-count, American Midling: 375.90</p>
<p>20-count, Lower grade: 360.70</p>
<p>32-count, American Midling: 397.80</p>
<p>32-count, Lower grade: 382.90</p>
<p>42-count, American Midling: 400.50</p>
<p>42-count, Lower grade: 385.60</p>
<p>Indian cotton has also arrived in Shanghai, approximately 5,000 pieces loaded on the British ship "Sudan" from Bombay. It was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai yesterday afternoon, but there was no news as of 6:00 PM. It is expected to arrive at the port last night or this morning and berth at Qichang Warehouse in Pudong for unloading.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Cloth Trading Listless, Sales Gradually Improving</h3>
<p>The cloth market is experiencing sluggish actual sales and tight monetary conditions. Holders of goods are inclined to sell, so market prices are gradually becoming unsustainable, falling step by step. As a result, fine cloth and fine twill fell by about one yuan per piece, coarse cloth fell by 2.5 to 5 jiao, and coarse twill, which had been low-priced, has recently seen quite active actual sales, so it has been uniquely firm. About 200 bales of coarse twill and coarse cloth, and over 100 bales of fine cloth and fine twill were traded on this street. Several tens of thousands of pieces of colored cloth, bleached cloth, poplin, linen yarn, and printed cloth were traded. The Guangdong traders handled over one hundred pieces of worsted, poplin, linen yarn, and other goods. The Ningbo, Wenzhou, and Taizhou traders from Zhejiang purchased over one hundred pieces of dark-colored goods such as coarse cloth and flannel. Purchases of light-colored goods are very rare.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Eastern cloth prices fell sharply due to persistently weak actual sales. The lowest price of Longtou fine cloth was 48.5 yuan per piece, and it rebounded slightly at the close to 49.75 yuan. The low price of Four Gentlemen worsted also dropped to 1.425 yuan per yard for spot goods, but after fellow traders collected it, the closing price was 1.455 yuan.</p>
<p>On the 9th, 170 pieces of exported piece goods were shipped to Xiamen, 1,030 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong, and 705 pieces were shipped to Haiphong.</p>
<h3>Food: Arrivals Surge, Sales Slow, Foreign Rice Continues to Decline, Japonica and Glutinous Rice Also See Rebound</h3>
<p>The rice market was even more volatile yesterday. Actual demand was stagnant, and speculators lost their support. Moreover, this increase in rice prices was entirely due to speculation. Once the market declined, everyone lost confidence and competed to sell. As a result, the previous mutual agitation turned into individual price reductions. Under these circumstances, prices plummeted all the way. For example, Xiaowen rice fell by half a yuan as soon as the market opened in the morning, to 48.5 yuan, and then fell further to 47.5 yuan. However, as soon as this price appeared, short covering started, and it rebounded to 48 yuan. Later, it fluctuated between 3 and 5 jiao, and finally closed at 47.8 jiao, a further decrease of 1.23 yuan compared to the previous closing price of 49 yuan. However, other goods such as Saigon rice were dragged down by this Xiaowen rice's repeated falls, and although there were varying degrees of fluctuation, the market line gradually became clearer and was no longer as chaotic as before. The quality could also be distinguished more clearly. The closing price of No. 1 Saigon rice was still 50 yuan to 49.5 yuan, No. 2 was 48.5 yuan to 48 yuan, No. 1 Siam was 49.5 yuan to 49 yuan, No. 2 was 48 yuan to 47.5 yuan, Huojiao was 49.3 yuan to 48.7 yuan, and Tokyo sharp rice was 47.5 yuan to 47 yuan. Mixed broken rice and rice tea were still unaffected due to the scarcity of goods and maintained their original prices.</p>
<p>Although the arrival of thick and thin Japonica national rice is still limited, it is rumored that the off-market black market is restricted by foreign rice and it is difficult to gain a foothold. Transactions are few, and selling prices are falling by more than one yuan. Wuxi Qing Special Japonica has entered the 50-yuan range, at 49.5 yuan to 49 yuan. Powdered Japonica is 48.5 yuan to 48 yuan. Changkun Japonica is 48 to 9 yuan. Old rice is 46 to 7 yuan. Qingsi special thin rice is 49 yuan, and the general market is 47 to 8 yuan. Nangang early rice is high at 47.5 yuan, and secondary is 46 yuan.</p>
<p>The market for glutinous rice was originally sluggish, and arrivals were crowded. Most lenders feared encountering a major decline, so they did not hesitate to bear losses and sought to sell quickly, resulting in a sharp drop of more than two yuan in prices. Liyang Special Grade was only sold for 40.05 yuan to 40 yuan, and Changdan City was 38.5 yuan to 38 yuan. Secondary goods such as Chao Rou were only about 47 yuan.</p>
<p>After several days of stabilization, the market for foreign rice has been declining. Speculators gradually lost interest because its market price had little room for maneuver, and those who had profited from retail and small-scale hoarding were eager to sell. Actual sales were sluggish, so the market continued to decline. Yesterday morning, spot foreign rice was more than one yuan cheaper, and in the afternoon it continued to fall by a few jiao to nearly one yuan. Xiaowen rice was more actively traded, and the opening price in the morning was still 48.35 yuan, but in the afternoon market it was as low as 47.35 yuan. At one point in the afternoon, it was as low as 46 yuan, but major players were still unwilling to sell cheaply. The May upper-period No. 2 Saigon also fell from 49.2 yuan to 48.89 yuan, but hoarders were more greedy, and the decline was slower than that of spot rice. A total of 5,000 bags of spot rice and 400 tons of futures were opened for trading throughout the day. According to reports, over 6,700 bags of foreign rice arrived in Shanghai yesterday. The Jardine Matheson's Yong Sheng arrived yesterday, carrying 723 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong. In addition, the Taikoo Company's Jinan arrived in Shanghai at noon yesterday, also carrying 6,039 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong. Both ships have been unloaded separately.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Irregular, Over 50,000 Bags Shipped to Xiamen</h3>
<p>The flour market turned flat. The trading throughout the day was quite irregular. The local market was sluggish because the factory price had reached 14 yuan and retail sales were not strong, so purchases were weak. Although sales to merchant groups were somewhat gradual, there was no hope of expansion. In addition, the decline in rice prices inevitably relaxed people's minds. The turnover of recycled old car brand flour was poor. Only domestic-made factory flour had some new transactions, with Kaishan Deer brand at 14.2 yuan and Phoenix brand transit goods at 13.9 yuan. The market was very calm and ordinary. The total volume of flour traded throughout the city was about 5,000 to 6,000 bags. There was no market for wheat.</p>
<p>On the 9th, 50,300 bags were exported to Xiamen, and 40,000 bags will be shipped to Tianjin tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Mainly Imported Raw Oil, Some Exports of Raw Peanuts and Beans</h3>
<p>Yesterday, 1,844 cans of raw oil arrived from Tianjin, and 1,000 cans arrived from Yantai. On the 9th, 1,535 bags of beans and 1,700 bags were exported to Xiamen, and 1,350 bags of raw peanuts were exported to Hong Kong. 500 cans of raw oil were shipped to Hong Kong, and 300 cans were shipped to Xiamen.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Sugar Prices Slightly Decline, Imports and Exports Also Significant</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw a slight loosening trend due to the strength of foreign exchange. The association set the price for 24 coarse white sugar at 76.3 yuan at local warehouses, down a few jiao. New goods at foreign warehouses were 76 yuan, and old goods were 75.8 to 6 jiao, a decrease of 5 or 6 jiao. Transshipment goods for delivery at the end of May were traded at 59.8 yuan, down 2 jiao. Taikoo's Car White B brand at the Western warehouse was 86.5 yuan, down half a yuan. HX brand was 85 yuan, and H brand was actually 63 yuan. Dutch Red at foreign warehouses was 66.5 yuan, and transshipment was 55.5 yuan. Local factory's special white sugar was 76 yuan, down 5 jiao. Local rock sugar was 90 yuan, and Jingming rock sugar was 92 yuan, both unchanged. Yesterday, 610 bags of Diaozhen, 200 bags of Car White, 425 bags of white sugar from Guangxi Bay, and 1,114 bags of red and white sugar from Haikou arrived on the Jinan. 125 bags of sliced sugar also arrived. On the 9th, 150 bags of sugar were shipped to Xiamen, and 3,000 bags will be shipped to Qingdao on the 10th.</p>
<h3>Woolen Cloth: White Serge in Short Supply</h3>
<p>White serge is quite scarce. Local textiles cannot be compared. Extremely rare products are not sufficient to supply and the market price suddenly jumped. Yesterday, 222 brand white serge was sold for 35 yuan for a batch of spot deliveries. Tihe was 28 yuan, and Donghuo's top grade was sold for 23 to 4 yuan, while ordinary was around 20 yuan. Most of the local factory goods from local factories such as Yihe, Hongkang, and Yongxing are selling for 17 to 8 yuan. Western clothing merchants have a large amount of orders due to summer needs.</p>
<h3>Hardware: Local Factory Nails Reach the 80 Yuan Mark</h3>
<p>The local factory nail market has flourished with the tightening of foreign exchange. However, its outlets, such as local construction merchants and Tianjin, Yantai, Qingdao merchants, are all experiencing sluggish sales, resulting in a sluggish market. The market stabilized when foreign exchange prices stabilized before yesterday. The price of local factory nails was no exception, so the various sales outlets in the local market saw a slight movement, but their price was already close to the 80 yuan mark, an increase of about 20 yuan compared to the previous sharp increase.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Silk Prices Remain Firm, Artificial Silk Continues to Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The American silk market fluctuated slightly yesterday. New York's near-term increased by 3 points, and the long-term decreased by 4 points. Yokohama spot goods increased by 10 yuan, and the long-term decreased by a small amount of 11 yuan. Silk deliveries at foreign firms were quite active yesterday. Libo Baixue brand was sold for 3,000 yuan, and 50 piculs of Libo Zhenfu brand were traded in total. Baitou Foreign Firm Qianjin Silk opened for trading with 20 piculs, at a price of 2,000 yuan. Silk prices are in a firm stabilization process.</p>
<p>Regarding artificial silk, most Eastern goods are recently coming to Shanghai from Hong Kong to fill up foreign goods. Yesterday, 266 bags arrived from Hong Kong on the Yong Sheng. It is also rumored that 1,000 bags of Italian-made artificial silk will arrive in Shanghai today on the Italian postal ship Cantrolegno. It is expected to be imported at around 3 PM today and will berth at the Shuntai Wharf in Hongkou for unloading.</p>
<p>New tea continues to be traded. The city collectively purchased over seventy boxes of Zhenmei green tea through Jinlong Tongfu and other firms. The selling price of Chouzhen was 575 yuan, and the selling price of Tongzhen was 46-7 yuan. The selling price did not fluctuate much. Currently, Chinese merchants have stopped purchasing because the price of inland raw tea is expensive. Yesterday, 3,354 pieces of tea leaves came from Hong Kong. Today, 124 pieces will be shipped to Xiamen, and 240 pieces will be shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Mulberry Leaves Soar—Spring Silkworms Have Reached the Second Molt</h3>
<p>This year's spring silkworms in Wuxi's rural areas are the most prosperous on record. The weather has been warm and mild in recent days, development has been rapid, and progress has been good. They have now reached the second molt. However, the demand for mulberry leaves exceeds the supply. The price has risen from 20 yuan for 3 dan to 40 yuan for 3 dan because all goods are increasing in price, and everyone is universally optimistic. (Liang)</p>
<h3>April Raw Silk Exports to the United States Decrease; Market Remains Firm</h3>
<p>The import and sales of raw silk in New York in April did not differ much from the previous month. Imports decreased by 1,285 bales, sales increased by 55 piculs, and inventory decreased by 3,189 piculs. Therefore, the silk market at the beginning of the month showed a firm and stable trend. The following is an excerpt of the statistics:</p>
<p>It is expected that New York's raw silk imports will decrease even further this month. Currently, the raw silk on the way to the United States totals 11,000 piculs, which is 2,200 piculs less than the previous month and 14,800 piculs less than the same month last year, a decrease of over 50%.</p>

<h3>Welcoming Spring Rituals (3)</h3>
<p>Among the ceremonial guards, there were over thirty pairs of "Virtuous Governance" plaques and seventeen "Ten Thousand People" umbrellas, embroidered with gold thread on red silk, dazzling and magnificent. They appeared like colorful clouds and mist, forming a canopy descending from the sky. This was because the esteemed magistrate was serious in his duties, and the people of Hangzhou were grateful for his virtue, so each village and neighborhood continuously and publicly contributed these items. Additionally, green banners carrying messages, golden gongs shaking the sky, all types of flags, arrows, spears, clubs, door spears, sitting flags, and battle gear were seen passing in teams of over forty people. Dozens of jailers, each in black clothing and black hats, with goose feathers inserted in their hair, either carrying leather whips on their shoulders or holding iron chains in their hands. There were also large bamboo segment boards and colorfully painted military clubs, all dragged along the ground. Handcuffs, chest clubs, and shackles sounded like chains, the noise of which was terrifying to hear. At this time, no less than a thousand people watched along the roadside, all silently observing without speaking. After the two county magistrates passed, the prefectural governor's procession connected along the road. Because the prefectural governor's position was more senior, the retinue was even more elaborate. The guiding attendants and the "Benevolent Governance" plaques and "Ten Thousand People" umbrellas were roughly the same, but the door spears, tokens, arrows, drawing tubes, punishment rods, and musicians and drummers, horn blowers, etc., all rode on horseback, unlike the county magistrates who walked. In between were dozens of personal soldiers, their uniforms bright and their weapons sharp, which was especially imposing. Behind them were horsemen like clouds, riding together, who were the clerks from the governor's office. The esteemed governor sat upright in his sedan chair, his demeanor dignified, and his appearance was vastly different from the two county magistrates.</p>

<p>Science</p>
<h3>The Advantages and Disadvantages of Science</h3>
<p>— Frugality</p>
<p>Mr. Genier, a lecturer at the University of Toulouse in France, recently wrote a book called "Machinery and Philosophy." In the book, he commented in detail on the progress of industry. Now, I will selectively introduce the main points of his book to readers.</p>
<p>There are about two reasons why there were no complex machines in ancient times:</p>
<p>(1) Science was still in its infancy in all aspects, so the ancients could not apply the principles of science to industry.</p>
<p>(2) The ancient economic system was based on the slave system. Modern British writer Huxley also said: "The economic system of ancient Greece was based on the slave system, so there was no need to use scientific principles to improve industry at that time."</p>
<p>The author writes: "It is the mistake of the ancients that the various philosophical problems have not been solved for centuries, while industry has advanced rapidly and completely changed the whole world. We should use the latest invented theories to find other truths, in order to improve the living conditions of human beings; or create a science to reduce human work."</p>
<p>However, the development of modern industry has caused another mistake. Around 1790, mechanization in England rapidly became widespread throughout the country. Workers were hit hard, most of them lost their jobs miserably, and fell into hunger and cold. By 1815, the main reason for unemployment among the working class was that too many goods were produced and there was nowhere to sell them. The reason for this is not the result of machines being too sophisticated, but the result of an uneven distribution of production... Workers sew many shirts every day, and these shirts are displayed in factories. Although they are piled up like mountains, they are of no benefit to the workers themselves. They are naked, which is ridiculous?</p>
<p>So our mistake is that we don't know how to manage the production of sophisticated industries and how to distribute the produced goods. As for the suffering of workers' unemployment, it has nothing to do with the development and improvement of industry itself.</p>
<p>However, we must clearly distinguish between science and industry. Science is only a kind of thought. Once it is applied to practice, it is no longer science. Therefore, many people blame the cruelty of war on the progress of science, which is a misunderstanding. Because science itself has no so-called good or evil, only the application of science can seek happiness for mankind or become a tool for killing people. Therefore, airplanes can carry patients or bombs. The itself has no good or evil. Whether it is beneficial or harmful depends on how it is used.</p>
<p>Therefore, the advantages and disadvantages of science are artificial. This is a question of usage, and to put it further, it can be said to be a question of system.</p>
<p>Reflections</p>
<h3>Little Cricket</h3>
<p>— Gongxi Cao</p>
<p>After watching the colorful cartoon "Pinocchio," the little cricket in the film has been jumping up and down in my heart, jumping so much that I can't help but say a few words.</p>
<p>Little Cricket is Pinocchio's conscience. He wants to make him brave, honest, and unselfish: to help him become a real boy.</p>
<p>The fox and the cat lured Pinocchio to the evil road. The first time they used reputation as a bait to sell him to the owner of the puppet show, but Little Cricket made him repent and be saved. The second time, they touched his heart with the happy life on Pleasure Island, and after running to have a good time, he grew a pair of donkey ears and a donkey tail. If it weren't for Little Cricket taking him out of the tiger's mouth, who knows what fate would have followed?</p>
<p>Pinocchio went home and couldn't find his father. The love for his father made him unafraid of all the difficulties. Little Cricket accompanied him to the belly of the whale in the sea, where he found his father. Later, in order to save his father, the puppet Pinocchio died, but in front of his father's tears, another Pinocchio appeared—a real boy.</p>
<p>Little Cricket fulfilled his duty of conscience, so the Blue Fairy gave him a gold badge.</p>
<p>This is of course a fairy tale, but it unintentionally strikes some people in China today.</p>
<p>A person's conscience, of course, cannot exist independently outside the body; however, a person's conscience may very well run out of the body and fly away without a trace. At that time, "temptation" is using its great power.</p>
<p>Today, China has some Pinocchios who are puppets, working hard for their masters, completely disregarding the fate of being locked in a cage when they go back at night; today, there are also some people in China who are dreaming of Pleasure Island, forgetting the old father who is about to be swallowed by a whale, completely disregarding whether they will still have the freedom to be a human being after "happiness."</p>
<p>These are all unscrupulous people. Their Little Crickets have already disappeared. I don't know when they will fly back?</p>
<p>I hope that "Pinocchio" can also have the opportunity to see "Pinocchio" while acting and dreaming of happiness. ——Fairy tales are fairy tales, but adults can also see some things. Because even if one is an adult, without a conscience, one cannot be a human being.</p>
<h3>Why Should the World Games Be Stopped?</h3>
<h3>Seize the Moment</h3>
<p>— Translated by Liu Jiagan from the original by Franklin</p>
<p>If time is the most precious of all things, then wasting time must be a huge waste, because lost time will never return; we often say that we have plenty of time, but the fact proves that there is never enough time.</p>
<p>Let us rise up and do things purposefully: through our diligence, we will have no difficulty in doing more things.</p>
<p>Laziness makes everything difficult, unless he is diligent, then everything can be turned from difficult to easy.</p>
<p>A person who gets up late must be busy all day long and still find it difficult to complete his tasks in the evening; poverty will immediately seize a lazy person.</p>
<p>Do your business, don't let business push you; get up early and go to bed early to become a healthy, wealthy and wise person.</p>
<p>Education</p>
<h3>Bertrand Russell and Sexual Morality</h3>
<p>— Wen He</p>
<p>The May 7th issue of this newspaper’s education news section carried an article entitled “Huge Uproar in American Educational and Youth Circles,” which readers must have seen. It discussed the matter of “Russell being ruled by the court as not being allowed to teach at New York College.” Regarding this matter, there were many details about the causes and consequences that were not mentioned in that day's newspaper, and this is to provide some supplementary information.</p>
<p>The person who stirred up this "huge uproar" was Bishop Manning of New York. Because Russell was going to teach at the State University of New York, Manning published an open letter in various newspapers, attacking Russell. The most severe point in the letter was regarding Russell's "adultery." This is because Russell had divorced three times. His first wife, Alys Pearsall, divorced him in 1921 on the grounds that Russell had an affair with another woman named Dora Winfred Black, who was about to give birth at the time. After the divorce, Dora became Russell's official wife. In 1933, she announced that she had given birth to a child with journalist Griffin Barry. At the same time, Russell seemed to be having affairs, and Dora instead accused him of adultery and divorced him in 1935. In 1936, when Russell was already in his sixties, he remarried his former female secretary, Patricia Helen Spence, and is still married to her. Russell had published opinions on adultery, believing that it was not worth making a fuss about, so Bishop Manning seized on this and severely reprimanded him.</p>
<p>Immediately, the Hearst newspapers responded to Bishop Manning, listing Russell's four major sins: (1) anti-religious; (2) immoral; (3) radical; and (4) heathen. With these four major sins, he was deemed unfit to teach in New York. Other church groups such as Catholics, Lutherans, and Baptists also rose up to denounce Russell.</p>
<p>On the other hand, prominent American professors and many university presidents stood up to defend Russell. M.R. Cohen, a philosophy professor at the City College of New York, said: "In all the universities where Russell has taught, no parent, faculty member, or school authority has ever said that Russell has had any immoral influence." This statement was strongly supported by students. N.P. Mead, the acting president of the City College, also said: "We are inviting him to teach philosophy and logic… not to discuss his personal moral views."</p>
<p>The New York City Council and the Board of Higher Education also held meetings one after another to discuss the matter. Finally, Mrs. Jean Kay, as a taxpayer, petitioned the court to terminate Russell's contract, because her daughter was about to enter New York College, and she did not want to see her daughter being negatively influenced by Russell, so she filed the lawsuit. Her lawyer brought four books written by Russell: "What I Believe," "Marriage and Morals," "Education and the Good Life," and "Education and the Modern World." In these four books, Russell advocated free sex and abandoning the constraints of marriage. Such ideas are of course quite dangerous to modern society, so the court, in order to respect public opinion, accepted her request and did not allow Russell to lecture at the City College of New York.</p>
<p>After learning of the verdict, Mrs. Kay said: "Justice and integrity have triumphed, and I am very happy. In this great struggle, I am a symbol… I believe that the mothers of the world all have their own philosophy, which is not only comparable to that of great philosophers, but also surpasses them in many ways."</p>
<p>Russell, who is still teaching at the University of California, was greatly surprised when he learned of this. He said: "This is a big blow to me. I don't know what to say. I want everyone to know: I didn't want that position… I am not like Bishop Manning. I am not as interested in sexual issues as he is."</p>

<p>Arts and Entertainment</p>
<h3>Recent Situation of the Performing Arts Scene in the Temporary Capital</h3>
<p>— Xiao Qi</p>
<p>The entertainment industry in the temporary capital, Chongqing, is now experiencing unprecedented activity, with a total of four luxurious cinemas, two Sichuan opera theaters, one Chu opera theater, two Peking opera theaters, one Dagushu (large drum storytelling) theater, and one Shandong opera theater.</p>
<p>The cinemas often screen softcore films like "The Secret History of the Louvre" and "Baibao Tu" (Map of a Hundred Treasures). The screening of "Mulan Joins the Army" gave the audience a big shock, which resulted in a surge of anger and a "film burning" incident, causing a major disturbance in the Chongqing film industry. In order to meet the urgent needs of this market, the China Film Studio has recently been working hard to produce films such as "Frontier Storm," "Japanese Spy," "Hometown of White Clouds," and "Light of East Asia." The writer Feng Hezi (Feng Zi) plays the main role in "Hometown of White Clouds"; other first-class artists such as Shu Xiuwen, Bai Yang, and Gao Zhanfei are all very active.</p>
<p>As a result of the efforts of cultural figures, various drama troupes have sprung up like bamboo shoots after rain, and there are quite a few remarkable successful scripts. For example, "Miss Jin," written and directed by Ling He, "Yue Fei" and "Metamorphosis" (written and directed by Cao Yu) of the National Drama School, "National Air Defense" (co-written by Lao She and Song Zhide, directed by Ma Yanxiang) of the China Wansui Drama Troupe, and "Shanghai Nights" (written and directed by Hong Shen, Ma Yanxiang, etc.) of the Fudan Drama Society have all achieved good results. Recently, because Zhang Min, He Mengfu, Sha Meng and other people have successively arrived in Chongqing, "Amateur" has the possibility of revival; Song Zhide's new script "Fog-laden Chongqing" for "Amateur" will soon be officially staged. With the convergence of talents, the drama movement in Chongqing can be said to be in a white-hot state.</p>
<p>Because popular literary writer Lao Xiang has joined forces with the performing arts community, the writers write and they take it to the stage to sing. From comedic Dagushu to Shandong Dagushu and crosstalk, there are often new topical and timely singing pieces to be heard, which penetrate deeply into the people and have the greatest impact. Sichuan opera and Chu opera, due to the limitations of dialect, are only popular with native Sichuanese who love these local operas with local flavor. People from other provinces rarely go to see them, except for the occasional fun. Even Peking opera, because of the long distance and the excessive cost, has never had any red-hot performers from Beijing and Shanghai showing their faces, which cannot but be said to be a regret!</p>
<h3>Louise Rainer Talks About the Secrets of Acting</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>"Please tell us some secrets of acting, Miss Rainer!" someone asked Louise Rainer, who had won the Academy Award twice.</p>
<p>She said: "I'm sorry, I don't have any secrets of acting, but I think actors must constantly 'learn.' Before I came to Hollywood, I had never learned English, but now I can speak it fluently. This can be said to be the result of hard work! From this point of view, as long as you study diligently, you will eventually succeed. That can be considered the secret of acting!"</p>
<p>She also said: "I never easily let go of the things I see and hear every day. I carefully study them, imitate them, and then perform what I have learned on the screen. Some people think I have extraordinary wisdom, but they don't know that I got it from 'learning'."</p>
<p>That person asked again: "Miss, what are your thoughts on winning the award twice?"</p>
<p>She replied: "I am certainly happy to win the award, but I dare not be complacent. I think the Academy Award is an indication that the actor has had some success, and its value is equal to a 'milestone'. In other words: 'Even if you are successful in playing a certain role, you still have to work hard to move forward. It definitely doesn't mean that after you win the Academy Award, your acting skills have reached their limit'."</p>
<p>Louise Rainer's acting skills have indeed reached a miraculous state, but she is still humble and modest. I hope the actors of domestic films will strive to learn her spirit of "learning"!</p>
<h3>Gorky Films are Popular in the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>(Tash Agency, Moscow) The Soviet cinemas are now showing the film "My Universities." The film tells the story of the great writer Gorky's arduous struggle in his youth. After Gorky arrived in Kazan, he originally planned to study, but because he was penniless, he could not achieve his goal. Gorky then set up a temporary "university" in a riverside bakery, studying diligently. The whole film depicts Gorky's darkest period of life, suggesting that young people should fight in such harsh environments.</p>
<h3>Interesting Facts About Entertaining the Performing Arts Community</h3>
<p>— Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>Wu Yunzhai and Wen Lanting, directors of the Shanghai Poor Children's Relief Association, are scheduled to hold a radio broadcast propaganda fundraising conference today (9th). Yesterday, they specially invited the entire Shanghai performing arts community to the Atlantic Western Restaurant to discuss the arrangements. Dozens of Pinghua (storytelling), Tanci (storytelling with stringed instruments), Shanghai opera, and comedy performers such as Fei Zhaolin, Zhao Jiaqiu, Zhu Xiaoxin, Bao Lele, Sheng Daidai, and Hou Wenbin attended. Wen Lanting chaired the meeting, and Li Wenjie and Fang Jiaobo reported that the association currently has 20 voluntary schools, divided into 60 classes, providing relief to 1,500 students. They now plan to add 50 voluntary schools to expand the number of relief students to 5,000, and funds are urgently needed, so they scheduled a radio broadcast on the 9th, asking the entire Shanghai performing arts community to assist... After the report, Gui Yanfang and Hu Guigeng were invited to speak. Later, someone suggested that Jiang Xiaoxiao and Liu Chunshan give an opening speech. So Jiang stood up and said that today they are inviting us to eat, because they want us to sing on the 9th. Now the colleagues are eating very well, and when broadcasting on the radio on the 9th, we should also be so energetic. Liu Chunshan said that we are doing mouth work today and on the 9th, but today is import and the 9th is export, and everyone laughed. Then Liu Ziyun and Huang Feilin were invited to speak. Liu said that the funds for the orphanage depend entirely on the radio broadcast. When it was first established, there were only 24 people, and now there are more than 500. It can be seen that those who make a living by talking contribute their efforts, and the audience pays for it, each doing their best. When Huang delivered his speech, he was righteous and impassioned, which was very moving. A gentleman sitting next to him said: Today's lunch is very enjoyable. People spend money to call a Tanghui (private performance), but I am afraid it is not as grand as today's gathering.</p>
