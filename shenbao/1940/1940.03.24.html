<h3 id="c14">歐戰中之巴爾幹 <a href="#c14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>蘇芬息戰媾和了之後，世人視綫又集中而轉移到巴爾幹。巴黎爾幹半島位東南歐，濱地中海；其間國族駢立，各自為政，更因歷史所恩怨，遂至今茲猶相水火。加以野心國家四面環伺，多方角逐；企圖操縱，恣意挑撥，鈎心鬬角，爾詐我虞；故識者視為富有危險性，而一觸即發的火藥庫。當一九一二年至一九一三年的時候，半島諸國間悲觀離合，釀成兩次后　，而上次歐戰的導火綫亦在於斯。最近二十年來，雖未砲火交加，然而外交戰與經濟戰，正在半島上全面展開着，考其背境，推其影響，卻又與歐洲各國息息相關。</p>
<p>巴爾幹半島物產豐富，故爲列强所覬覦，而德國允視之爲最重要的原料貯藏所。綜其消耗所餘的糧食與各種原料。可以供應德國進口的半數。平時即已如此，何况在目前的戰爭時期，德國更需要巴爾幹各國糧食與原料的接濟，以與英法的經濟封鎖相抗衡。原來德國雖然號稱强大，但是其經濟資源實在貧窮之列。依據納粹德國的計劃，巴爾幹的豐富資源如五穀，油類，煙草，木材，鋼鐵，錳以及鋁質等，均應加以大規模的開發，而優惠的供給德國實業濟經的需要。然而德國對此半島，事實上的窒碍孔多，以致小克控制盡如己意；在這戰時更因地理與軍事的限制，交通轉運上的困難允多。誠然德國與蘇聯交歡之後，直接間接得到不少方便，但德蘇情形，自不相同。因爲蘇聯國內鋼鐵油麥等的產量足以自給，無需巴爾幹方面的接濟，所以蘇聯和巴爾幹諸國，原來祇須保持其情感上和傳統上的聯繫；尤其是對於保加利亞和南斯拉夫的斯拉夫民族，更爲易於發生密切的感應，故保南兩國似乎先天的傾向蘇聯。德國則不然。簡單分別之；德國對於巴爾幹的關懷是以經濟利益爲主，蘇聯則以政治情緒爲主；而德蘇兩國間即因此旨趣之殊，目前對於巴爾幹有其密切提携的可能。此一隅的密切提携，要爲今後歐局演變中的重大因素。</p>
<p>至於義大利涉足巴爾幹的情形、似與德國相仿，近水樓臺，既屬易於獲得大批原料的供給；又可作爲戰略上的重要據點，以保護其軟弱的亞得里亞海岸綫以及與東菲屬地的交通綫。所以義國在巴爾幹所採取的政策，是在組成政治集團，作爲義國對於歐洲國際的外衛，同時組成經濟集團，以抗拒外來的種種經濟攻勢。但是至目前爲止，義國在此方面的成就，還是相當的渺茫空虛。最近，德義兩國巨頭在勃倫納山隘會晤，中題當然重在世界全局，但據聞希特勒曾力勸義相親近蘇聯，並明白提供保證，表示蘇聯決不向巴爾幹半島伸張勢力，以免威脅義大利。此項傳說。雖難證實，但德國方面有此意願，則無待乎旁證。然而推究其間因果與利害，蘇聯對於巴爾幹方面，亦有其需求，即如對羅馬尼亞要求收回比薩拉比亞，此其意願。迄今無可佐證蘇聯的業已放棄。即以德義兩國而論，縱使沒有對蘇態度問題橫梗其間，但兩國在巴爾幹方面在政治上經濟上的矛盾，亦屬不可諱飾。因此之故，德義蘇在巴爾幹能吾融和，實有根本疑問；事在今茲，則充極其量，僅能暫時獲得調整而已，再就英法而論，視巴爾幹爲最適宜於投資的處所；例如羅馬尼亞的煤油，羅馬尼亞與南斯拉夫的鋼鐵，以及南斯拉夫與匈牙利的鋁鑛等，大多利用英法各國的資本而開發；投資利益所在，安肯坐視其消失；何况消失之結果，即是資敵？抑又不但如此而已，巴爾幹半島上的勢力消長，直接影響及於英法在地中海內的安危，這是英法命脈所關的交通綫；又豈願任人割斷？</p>
<p>綜而言之，巴爾幹的局勢是極端複雜的。德義英法蘇聯五國。在不同的程度之下，各視巴爾幹半島各國的友敵向背，爲安危禍福利害榮枯的關鍵。第一次歐戰的主因在此，而竟未能獲致澈底而公道的解決；今决歐戰表面上絕非爲了巴爾幹，然其事實上的最後焦點，則仍有以巴爾幹為　宿的可能。無論勝敗誰屬，無論彼此領土或竟無所損益，無論雙方政治觀點是否由戰爭判決了黑白存廢；然巴爾幹力面將由此决歐戰而造成一種新的覇權，或即是此戰的唯一產物！以目前而論，歐西戰事久於沉悶之餘。竟爾忽然以巴爾幹爲決戰的戰塲，亦非異數！</p>

<p>一般人談及近東軍事形勢，都以魏剛將軍駐在叙利亞的兵力如何及巴力斯坦和埃及英軍的援助如何爲中心。關於魏剛將事部下的軍隊，外間頗多離奇的傳說。據可靠的負責方面消息，道方面的軍隊共有十五萬人，都是訓練有素。配備精良。到必要，當然可從法屬菲洲及英屬印度調到一倍或兩倍的援軍。（編者按，巴黎最近消息，法國已在近東集中軍隊二十七萬五千人。同時倫敦電亦稱，英法聯軍在近東集中的的有五十萬人，這一電訊曾被英國檢查員撤銷。）</p>
<p>近東方面駐有這樣重兵，英法聯軍可謂已劍及履及，使德穌不敢妄動。假使德蘇兩國欲在巴爾幹半島有所舉動或向俘拉克進兵，這支法軍便可成爲近東軍的基本隊伍。其總司令就是上次歐戰襄助福煦元帥的宿將魏剛將軍。</p>
<p>一般人都承認，巴兩幹半島的前途，擊於希特勒一人。希特勒若能不戰而取得巴爾幹半島，顯然對他有利。德國在本年春季或到夏季，如果原料的供給感覺不足，或不免對巴爾幹半島用兵，那末英法聯軍與之週旋，是無可避免的了。</p>
<p>但據軍事觀察家說，上次大戰時，英法聯軍佈置近東陸綫，歷時很久。至於德軍或能在數星期之內進估羅馬尼亞和南斯拉夫的北部，然後由英法聯軍援助巴爾幹半島各國的軍隊與德軍在南斯拉夫南部和希臘山地展開眞正的血戰。</p>
<p>這種發展是可能的事，照現勢看來，經淸戰爭將繼續在巴爾幹半島變本加厲的進行，逐漸釀成武力衝突的局面。當然，希特勒不可捉摸的心理也許會改變這種局勢的演進。不過無論如何，義大利勢必在巴爾幹半鳥佔得一份地位。該國對於英法聯軍在該方面登岸，和德軍即使不進犯羅馬尼亞而侵佔南斯拉夫，是同樣反對的</p>
<p>至於英法聯軍的進攻巴庫和蘇聯紅軍的進攻摩蘇爾，一般人都謂為時尙遠。土耳其蘇聯兩國邊境和伊朗北部地帶，對於現代機械化部隊，具有不可克服的困難。惟據軍界人士意見，戰爭如果曠日持久，近東勢必淪爲戰塲。上次大戰，勝負係在西綫決定的。現在法國的馬奇諾防綫及德國的　格飛防綫，都不能輕易突破，那末，這决歐戰或當在近東一決勝負。（譯紐約　Herald　Trlbune）</p>

<p>（二）本年一月三日、華捕二三七三號、在福建路蕪湖路捉獲持械匪徒一名、緣當時該捕在巡邏之時、瞥見持械匪徒一名、為法租界警員所追趕、渠當即向前攔截、結果將其擒獲、</p>
<p>（三）一月五日、福州路發生械刦案一起、事後盜匪若干人、由一店夥後、隨向巡邏隊指明報吿、此時華捕二九五〇號見一持械匪徒奔經身旁、該捕隨後發槍六響、將其擊斃、</p>
<p>（四）一月八日、新閘捕房接獲盜刦警報、當即派遣探捕多名、馳往出事地點、結果盜黨全體就擒、其中有一匪徒後門逃出者、為西籍試用巡長勃爾品開槍尾追、該匪當即還擊、未幾該匪跳上人力車一輛、勃氏奮勇向前將其擊斃、</p>
<p>（五）一月十七日晚間、日籍巡長茂雄、及試用巡長雅治兩人、正在華盛路便衣巡邏、忽聞警報、渠等立即趕往出事地點、並追趕華籍匪徒兩名、其中一名返身向雅治開槍、雅治還槍、均未命中、匪徒旋即分途而逃、該巡長等亦即分頭緊追、一匪於黑暗之中　其脫逃、另一匪由茂雄將其扭住、而為雅治擊斃</p>

<p>憑證駁載</p>
<p>一、嗣後甬埠各輪船公司發售客票時、應同時收取駁船費、並另給駁船證、證上編列顯明號數（式樣另定）、並應在開始之前一天、將各駁船應載之旅客、憑駁船證號數、及自某碼頭開出時間、在各碼頭公佈、一面在各該碼頭上、用大號字寫明、持有第幾號至第幾號駁船證之旅行客商、應上某駁船等字樣、俾旅客得依號乘船、不致有擁擠逾載等情事、二、各碼頭稽查士兵、應查旅客駁船證、如所持號數相符者、方可准其魚貫登船、否則應加阻止、三、取締小划船載客攔駁、當由寗波稽查隊駐輪稽查負責辦理、四、旅客大件行李、非本人所能提携、或手提行李、在二件以上者、均由輪公司負責做行李票手續、酌收行李費、到達時、再由輪公司妥交旅客、五、大輪起椗前、所有登岸之船員或夫役、咸趁當日最後班之駁船回輪、如已滿額者、須另行設法、不得隨便搭乘、免紊秩序、</p>
<p>嚴禁逾額</p>
<p>六、滬客至鎮海口外駁過時、應由輪船上事務長派得力人員、會同鎮海稽查員兵、依照下列各點辦理、（甲）旅客應由中輪一個　口內魚貫上駁船、不得爭先、（乙）上輪絕對不准載客、或堆積行李物件、（丙）各駁船絕對不准途額載客、滿額時即行離開大輪、（丁）駁運帆船、不得駁客、七、鎮海口外接駁船隻、由鎮海稽查隊各派隊士數名、維持秩序、並應加監視、八、鎮海口外各駁船、抵達寗波碼頭時、應由稽查隊人士、會同船上人員、依照下列各點辦理、（甲）不准小划船在中途接客、（乙）駁船靠近碼頭時、絕對嚴禁脚夫上船兜攬生意、（丙）應通知各旅行客商嚴守秩序、俟輪靠妥、纜繩繫好後、再行魚貫下船、上列辦法、除第三第七第八三條、電請防守司令部遵飭辦理外、昨抄發駁船證式樣、令仰鄭縣輪商業公會、迅即轉飭各輪駁公司遵辦、並將遵辦日期及遵辦經過、詳細呈報備查、</p>

<p>歐戰爆發後、本市各種原料來源、均較前昂貴、尤以棉紗漲價更甚、最近星洲又限制非金鎊國貨品入口、然本市各種織品、未受若何影響、蓋目前本市各種織品之銷往歐洲或南洋數量、均較前激增、各廠咸加開夜工、增加生產、以應銷路、茲分誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>英國市場　需要尤切</p>
<p>查自歐洲戰事爆發後、本市織造品之運銷於英法及其他歐洲市場者、均校前增加、尤以英國各地市場、需要更切、昨據本市國貨界消息、銷英數量、較前已增加七八倍左右、如戰事繼續下去、則今後滬織品在英法各地市場、必將日趨增加、其主要原因、（一）為英法各廠家以適應戰事需要、多改製一切戰時必需品、（二）因航運關係、加拿大及日本等織品、運銷英法減少、乃予滬貨織品一良機、</p>
<p>南洋方面　銷路拓展</p>
<p>又運往南洋各屬地滬織品、尤趨活躍、星洲當局雖頒禁非金鎊國貨品入口、惟僅小部份在禁止之例、大部份如認為需要、當地商人尚可隨時請准運銷、且荷屬東印度及菲列濱南非洲等地市場、漸形拓展、預料滬織品之運銷以上各地、勢趨增加、不過為劣貨冒牌織品之傾銷、遭逢若干之打擊、如宣傳得法、使當地僑胞能深刻認識、則滬市織品運銷南洋、實未可限量、</p>

<p>— 女宛</p>
<p>小朋友，我們大家來計算一下，在家裏有多少時候，在學校裏有多少時候，假定有一個小朋友，上午七時上學，下午四時散學，衹有九小時在學校裏，整整有十五小時是在家裏的，雖然不是每個小朋友都是如此，可是在家裏總比在學校裏的時候長得多了。如果我們的家庭生活，處理得有條理，有秩序，那麼我們的學校生活一定是美滿的，有心得的。</p>
<p>在家裏我們接觸的是父母和兄弟姊妹，生活是閒散的，自由的，有時雖然嚴父來督促你，教訓你，可是慈母的愛，往往使你懶散起來，閒蕩起來。在學校裏，接觸的是老師和同學，生活是有紀律的，有規則的，你做錯了什麼事，同學們就要來指摘你，譏笑你，老師就要嚴厲的教訓你，使你不得不改善自己。於是家庭與學校的生活不能互相聯絡和合作，譬如在常識課中知道吃零食是有害處的，可是回到家裏，不管什麼東西都要買來吃，在學校裏輪到做値日生就要掃地抹桌，在家裏自己的衣服書本也不肯收拾整理，老是這樣下去，我們的學業怎樣會進步，我們的生活怎樣會美滿和愉快。所以家庭與學校生活的聯絡，除掉需要教師和父母的幫助外，還要小朋友自己為中心，努力的聯絡起來，在學校裏做個好學生，在家庭裏做個好小孩，對於國家，做個好國民。</p>
<p>我們如何使家庭和學校生活合作呢，有以下數點來告訴你們。</p>
<p>（一）在學校裏不過得到的是一種知識，叫你不要吃零售，叫你不要說謊，叫你要辛勤工作，叫你要整齊清潔，叫你……有許多事叫你做，所以你不但要知，還要用，用在我們的家庭生活中，看它結果，是否能使自己滿意。</p>
<p>（二）在我們家庭四周，有許多沒有受過教育的人，他們不知道冷水是有細菌的，不知道菜蔬裏有維他命的，所以你就要告訴給他們聽，使每一個人都有普通常識。</p>
<p>（三）有規則的家庭生活，在家裏亦要和學校裏一樣，有一定時間吃飯，睡覺，讀書，遊玩，使我們的生活有次序，有始有終的做完一天的工作，那麼在學校裏也不會感到時間上的不便利</p>
<p>如果肯照　這樣做，再加上小朋友自勉力行，那麼我們的生活一定能進步的，一定會有價值的。</p>
<h3 id="c107">從七十二烈士說到黃克強先生 <a href="#c107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>— 龍駒生</p>
<p>小朋友們，光陰眞快，再隔四天，又逢黃花岡七十二烈士殉國的二十九年週年紀念日了。要景仰先烈，沉痛紀念，切勿「數典忘祖」。前年國府當局，因在抗戰建國期間，特再規定將三月二十三日鄧仲元先生殉國，五月十二日胡展堂先生逝世，五月十八日陳英士先生殉國，八月二十日廖仲愷先生殉國，九月二十一日朱執信先生殉國，十月三十一日黃克强先生逝世等各紀念日，合併在革命先烈紀念節，同時舉行。這許多先烈，都是締造民國的功人，足以彪炳千古的，筆者姑就七十二烈士，說到黃克强先生的史實，寫給小朋友們一讀吧！</p>
<p>七十二烈士　遜清宣統三年，（辛亥年）三月二十九日，革命黨人黃興（克强）等，率眾起義攻襲兩廣督署，會水師提督李準率師至，黨人不敵，所約響應之軍，亦未發動，於是事乃不成，興受傷走免，其餘殉難者，在當時据查有七十二人，因稱「七十二烈士」叢葬於「黃花岡」（在今廣東番禺縣城東北，白雲山之麓，）故又稱黃花岡烈士。民國成立，以其起義之日，定為革命先烈紀念日，民國八年，林森等，為修其墓，並陸續探求得七十二烈士之姓名，籍貫，泐碑記之，以垂永久。</p>
<p>黃克强先生　革命黨領袖黃興先生，字克强，有文才，饒胆略，清季，與孫中山先生，共倡革命，光緒丁未年（按即光緒三十三年，西歷一九〇七年）舉事於雲南河口，事敗走越南，辛亥三月，率眾攻廣州督署，復敗於李準，受剙，僅以身免，逮十月武昌起義，與清軍大戰於漢陽，光復後，南京政府成立，任陸軍總長，嗣袁世凱就總統任，政府北遷，興留守南京，宋教仁被殺，自起討袁無功，走日本。復去，居南洋，　卒於滬。</p>

<p>時　滴嗒滴嗒地響着，鐘擺自左至右，自右向左的擺個不休，長針和短針終日終夜的在鐘麵上競走，長針雖是走得很快，時時越過了短針，在前領導，然而短針仍不甘示弱不屈不撓的，不因自己的落後而垂頭喪氣，依舊如蛇行般一步一步的踱着它的方步，而有時却能走在長針的前面，原來它們倆是在舉行循環賽跑呀！可是這樣的走了約有一個星期的光景，它們倆才一同休息，這因為它們倆的原動力——發條已告無力，於是那鐘便停着不走了。宗兒是担任命令它們倆再繼續舉行競走的發令員，原來在他家裏開鐘的工作，一向由他負担的，因為他身體比較高大，對於這工作當然是輕而易舉的，可是他一聽到他母親叫他開鐘的喊聲，總是打不起他的興趣，雖是他弟弟——庸兒却很高興去開鐘，而母親却不叫他弟弟去，偏偏要喊他去幹。</p>
<p>「要是現在有一座永久不停的鐘，豈不好。我也可以不再去幹這我不高興做的事。」宗兒在開鐘時，這樣的咕噥着·</p>
<p>庸兒帶着譏諷的語調說道：「那麼留待你去發明吧。」</p>
<p>「你也不要譏刺我，這永久不停的鐘在十八世紀時已有人發明過，可惜經過的時期太長，到現在便失傳了，但是有些天文學家所能迴憶起的，把它有重新制造的可能，可是還沒有成功。」這些話倒引起了庸兒的注意，便急急的去問宗兒倒底是怎樣的？</p>
<p>「這种不停的鐘是利用它在周圍的環境中，吸收它所需要的無盡藏的力量來工作。這是根據一種水銀氣壓針的原理，因為大氣壓力不時的變更，水銀便忽上忽下，而指針也不停地搖動，把這種氣壓針的運動，應用到鐘錶上，使鐘錶不需我們的照顧，而能永久不息的　行。據說它的構造是很複雜，和一　大規模水銀氣壓計差不多：有一隻掛在橫架上的水銀玻璃壺，壺裏倒插着一根盛有水銀胆瓶的長頸玻璃管，這兩個東西是活動地相連接，是一種很巧妙的槓桿。當大氣壓力大時，玻管的水銀被壓下而水銀壺就升高，壓力小時便有相反的結果，從這兩個運動，可使鐘上的小齒輪向着一方旋轉，如果氣壓不變，則齒輪也不動，於是鐘便要停止，那就有預先積藏着的錘子下降的力量去活動，那鐘便又走了，可是錘子下降後，要它上升，這構造却並不容易，同時氣壓的搖動力也很難應用，而且錘子的升降須要有一定的規律，這種種的困難，到現在還沒有人能克服，並且這座鍾的代價比了現在的鐘要貴得多，又很笨重，所以直到現在沒有人高興去利用了。」</p>

<p>— 一木</p>
<p>此刻他須得走上一條全是紅石堆成的山脊，地上連一根青草都沒有，兩脚踏上去兀自　痛，頭上也沒有一塊突出的岩，給他遮蔽可怕的陽光。這時剛過中午，那烈日照在高低不平的山路上，連那空氣也凝定不動，充滿着熱力。漢士又渴又疲乏，非常的痛苦，他連連在那掛在腰帶上的水瓶瞧着，暗暗想道：「這要三滴水也就夠了，即使不能解渴，也可以凉凉我的嘴脣」。</p>
<p>他開了水瓶擎到嘴上，他的眼睛却看到了身旁岩石上躺着的小東西，似乎正在動彈。原來是一頭小狗，分明因了渴極而在和死神掙扎着。它的舌子伸在嘴外，牙床是乾了，四肢軟綿綿地展開，一　黑蟻正在它的嘴脣邊和咽喉上爬動。這時它瞪大了眼睛，瞧着漢士手　的水瓶。漢士自管把瓶中的水喝了，伸出脚去把那狗踢了一下，仍然向前進行。他不知怎的，覺得那蔚藍色的天空中，忽然來了一個奇怪的暗影。</p>
<p>山徑是越走越欹斜而高低不平了；那高山上的空氣不但不覺爽快，反好似使它的血液燃燒起來。瀑布下瀉的聲音，譏笑他似的兀自在他耳邊響着，因為相去很遠，而他的渴却正在一分鍾一分鐘的增加起來。再過了一點鐘，他又瞧瞧腰邊的小瓶，瓶中雖已乾了一半，但還不止一滴哩。他站住了脚，揭開水瓶的蓋來，不道正在這時，又瞧見上面的山徑中有什麼東西動彈着。原來是一個可憐的小孩子，半生不死的躺在石上，也因渴極之故，胸口不住的起伏，眼睛是閉了，嘴脣乾得發燒。漢士毫不在意的瞧了他一眼，喝罷了水；重又向前進行。</p>
<p>一抹灰褐色的暗雲罩住了陽光，長蛇似的影子慢慢地佈滿了山坡一帶。漢士掙扎前進，疲乏得什麼似的。太陽是在沈下去了，然而仍然不覺得凉快，反覺得那窒悶而沉重的空氣壓住了他的頭和心，幸而目的地已漸漸地近了。他眼見那黃金江的瀑布從山邊跳出來，距離他的頭上不到五百英尺的光景，他立住了抽一口氣，就飛步趕將上去。</p>
<p>正在這時，他聽得一個低弱的呼聲，轉過身去，却見一位花白頭髮的老人躺在石上。他的兩眼是陷下去了，臉色慘白如死，滿現着一派絕望的神情。他向漢士伸出兩臂，有氣沒力的喊道，「水！水！我快要渴死了。」漢士勃然答道：「我沒有什麼水，像你這樣年紀，可也活得够了。」於是他踏過了那僵木的身體，大踏　向上走去。</p>

<p>耶穌死是消極方面的貢獻，復活，升天是積極方面的，非耶穌從死復活，我們沒有活潑的盼望，耶穌被衣給人，是為我們的過犯，復活是叫我們稱義，我們旣藉神兒子的死得與神和好，旣已和好，就更要因他的生得救，如果耶穌沒有復活，我們所信的，便是枉然，與其他宗教也就沒有甚麼大的分別，到了晚上，有一個財主名叫約瑟，是亞利馬太來的，他也是耶穌的門徒，這人去見彼拉多求耶穌的身體，彼拉多就吩咐給他，約瑟取了身體，用乾淨細麻布裏好，安放在自己的新墳墓裏，就是他　在磐石裏的，他又把大石頭輥到墓門口就去了，有抹大拉的馬利亞，和那個馬利亞在那裏，對着墳墓坐着，次日就是預備日的第二天祭司長和法利賽人聚集，來見彼拉多說，大人，我們記得那誘惑人的，還活着的時候曾說，三日後我要復活，因此請吩咐人將墳墓把守妥當，直到第三日，恐怕他的門徒來把他偷了去，就告訴百姓說，他從死裏復活了，這樣，那後來的迷惑，比先前的更利害了，彼拉多說，你們有看守的兵，去罷，盡你們所能的，把守妥當，他們就帶着看守的兵同去，封了石頭，將墳墓把守妥當，安息日將盡，七日的頭一日，天快亮的時候，抹大拉的馬利亞，和那個馬利亞來看墳墓，忽然地大震動，因為有主的使者，從天上下來，把石頭輥開，坐在上面，他的像貌如同閃電，衣服潔白如雪，看守的人，就因他嚇得渾身亂戰，甚至和死人一樣，天使對婦女說，不要害怕，我知道你們是尋找那釘十字架的耶穌，他不在這裏，照他所說的已經復活了，你們來看安放主的地方，快去告訴他的門徒說，他從死裏復活了，並且在你們以先往加利利去，在那裏你們要見他，看哪，我已經告訴你們了，婦女們就急忙離開墳墓，又害怕，又大大的歡喜，跑去要報給他的門徒，忽然耶穌遇見他們，說，願你們平安，他們就上前抱住他的脚拜他，耶穌對他們說不要害怕，你們去告訴我的弟兄叫他們往加利利去在那裏必見我，他們去的時候，看守的兵，有幾個進城去，將所經歷的事，都報給祭司長，祭司長和長老聚集商議，就拿許多銀錢給兵丁說，你們要　樣說，夜間我們睡覺的時候，他的門徒來把他偷去了，倘若這話被巡撫聽見，有我們勸他，保你們無事，兵丁受了銀錢，就照所吩咐他們的去行，這話就傳說在猶大人中間，直到今日，十一個門徒往加利利去，到了耶穌約定的山上，他們見了耶穌就拜他，然而還有疑惑，耶穌進前來，對他們說，天上地下所有的權柄，都賜給我了，所以你們要去，使萬民作我的門徒，奉父子聖靈的名，給他們施　，凡我所吩咐你們的，都教訓他們遵守，我就常與你們同在，直到世界的末了，因此我們所信的主耶穌不是睡在墳墓，乃是活在天上，因為他是神的兒子，不能被死拘緊就是聖靈在我們心中亦同作此證，他是葡萄樹，我們是枝子，基督徒的根基是穩定在天，所以任遭何苦，不能摧殘除減，因他是教會的元首，直活到永永遠遠（完）上海郵政信箱一二二七號</p>

<p>— 維特</p>
<p>無疑的，只要科學有進步，游藝界中的電影事業也會得有進步，據目前一般歡喜欣賞電影和專以電影作消遣娛樂的人，它們心目中以五彩影片算最滿意了。拿事實來證明『羅賓漢』『小人國』都把彩色的成分作誇大的宣傳，於是賣座當然好了。所以我說，電影的將來，五彩片勢必淘太整個黑白影片的局面，這是必然的，喏！讓我道出理由來：</p>
<p>電影可以把人或其他動物一切的活動攝入鏡頭，重新複映出來，所遺憾者，就是不能將天然的景色拍進膠片中間去，碧綠的波濤，靑嫩的樹葉，緋色的花朶，在銀慕上給我們看起來還不過是黑白雜綜的畫面，雖然這畫面並不討厭，但究竟沒有和眞的一樣來得動人，聰明的電影製片家爲要迎合觀衆的心理起見在黑白的畫面上加製五彩，道就是五彩影片了。但是這種五彩影片往往過於煊染，有些地方反而有些失眞。</p>
<p>美國的電影工程師，正在研究『單捲式』攝製眞色電影的方法，祇用一組塗有多種膠質的軟片，感光後，經過特殊的冲洗法，就可得到『天然色』的影片，不過這種新方法，還沒有研究成功，可是不久的將來，一定能够實現，黑白影片無疑的將遭到非常的厄運。</p>
<p>彩色電影的功臣有依夫氏（Frederick.E.Ives）歐朋氏（Charles　Urban）斯密司氏（Albert,G.Smith）等，但這都是五十年前的研究五彩電影者，還有不知多少無名功臣現正參加五彩影片的發展工作哩。</p>

<p>— 遊記者</p>
<p>這次，難民協會在新世界主辦的救難遊藝大會，上海話劇界也參加作慈善公演。「文天祥」是五個獨幕劇裏面最精彩成功的一個，這劇本的原作者孔麟君，雖已離滬，而它遺留給「孤島」劇壇的這個珍貴的戲劇，是已　無數决給許多戲劇團體公演着。</p>
<p>「父歸」「回家以後」「石庫門」「逃婚」四個戲演出成績也還不錯，比較起來，「文天祥」的故事和對白，更留給觀衆許多激剌深刻的　念，千百個觀衆熱烈而本能地鼓掌。</p>
<p>關於「文天祥」的故事是値得介紹的，它寫南朱末年，元兵侵宋，宋相文天祥奉益王命起勤王兵，力抗元兵，不幸被執，宋叛將張弘範在降元以後，想勸文投降，用盡威脅利誘的手段，但文不屈，慷慨請死。在短短的道個獨幕劇裏面，關於忠奸邪正的剝露描畫，發揮着戲劇最高的戚力，「明末遺恨」以外，「文天祥」是本年度最好的一個精悍短小獨幕劇了。</p>

<p>— 企華</p>
<p>「情聖殉國」是「貢格廷」的作者吉百齡的作品，所以在考爾門瞎了眼睛而傑作又毀滅了時候，將他驅送到戰塲上，一馬當前，向土人的火綫上衝去，而「殉」了「國」。但是截去了首尾的「侵略戰爭」，「情聖殉國」有着一個非常動人的故事：一個成名後的畫家，得不到他小時候愛侶的愛情，在他最後一幀傑作米完成之前，又知道他的眼睛將要失明；這剌激更使他努力作畫，但是這幀傑作還廿「查獲特兒」的憎恨意念之下毀滅了。</p>
<p>這故事不禁使我想起却爾期鮑育與愛琳鄧的「畫中愛寵」來，可是「情聖殉國」的導演不能把這動人的故事生，地跳躍在銀幕上，相反地便人感到沉悶。試舉幾個例子：（一）狄克知道自己將要失明的時候；（二）他的畫毀滅了，但他還不知道，而給美茜觀看。（三）貝茜吿訴他已經塗毀了那幅畫；這三塲重要的戲導演者都沒有把悲劇氣氛緊緊地抓住，尤其是（二）狄克把遮布揭開的時候，觀衆相反地哄笑了起來。同時狄克，美茜和貝茜之間的關係也不够明朗。這缺點，故事太長自然是一個大原因，響如開塲時用三决字幕來介紹三個時間和地方，就可以看出導演者對這故事的難於處理了。</p>
<p>考爾鬥的劇是努力的，就爲了上述的原因，不能給人更深的印象。伊黛羅碧諾的貝茜是「冒上」的，縱聲大笑（這也是全片中處理得最好的一塲戲）及說出塗壞了那幅畫的時候充份地刻劃了「憂鬱」的性格。</p>

<p>貂斑華跟從前似乎換了一個人，熱情如火的人一變而爲冷若冰霜，不單如此，而且除了拍戲之外，總是杜門謝客，交際塲中簡直找不到她的芳踪。前年從香港隻身來滬，即加入藝華公司，僅僅拍了一部「王寳釧」，扮相很好，可說古裝片和貂斑華是極有緣份。今春岳楓復進藝華導演「閻惜姣」，事前主角人選就決定兩個，一是于素蓮，一是貂斑華，後來大家考慮下來，認爲于素蓮的檢蛋兒太方，說話帶麒派，因此才決定起用貂斑華，搭擋的男主角是梅熹，果然這一次貂斑華非常用心，把「閻惜姣」文騷父辣的身份完全做了出來，岳楓說：貂斑華這次要抖起來啦，貂班華自己也說：這番總算眞正做到戲了：可見此片內容的一斑了。</p>

<p>— 塵</p>
<p>民國二十九年的民族掃墓節，轉瞬間父在眼前了，在這日騎縱橫，烽火遍地的今日，遇此令節，倍覺其意義之偉大</p>
<p>我們爲着紀念對於我們民族有大勳勞的聖帝明王，名臣良將，如黃帝，漢武帝，唐太宗，明太祖，岳飛，戚繼光等，特定淸明日爲民族掃墓日，央祭掃他們的陸墓，以示崇敬。同時，以他們爲表率，繼承其遺志，保持已往的光榮歷史，這是民國二十三年開始舉行此頃典禮的原意。</p>
<p>屈指計之，至今已有七載，在這七年中，民族意識的增强，眞是一日千里。我們翻開歷史一看，知道中華民族有　特點，就是愈在外患侵臨的時候，民族間的團結力愈强，愈有勁，「多難興邦」，大概就是這個意思。所以此决七七蘆溝橋抗戰發動以後，領土的一綫或一點，雖被人暫佔，而民族的光芒，並不因此受挫；相反地，却因此而愈發揚光大。</p>
<p>其另一特點，就是民族奮鬥的有持久性。我們看一看，歷代外族入據後，以民族意識結合的民間秘密團體，即蓬勃而起，且存續極久；又如元末淸末時，革命團體的轟烈，都足證明中華民族雖外表暫陷淪亡，但人心雖歷數百年不死，一有機會，就奮起光復，何况現在的政府，實力不但絲毫無損，且日見强大呢。這一點，際此民族掃墓節的前夕，司以吿慰許多民族英雄在天之靈的。</p>
<p>古　云「疾風知勁草，板蕩識英雄。」在今日的抗戰中，除去少數甘為奴隸者外，成千的民族英雄，留名的或不留名的，在沙塲上為國捐軀，所以抗戰完成後的民族掃墓節，必較現在盛大熱烈，這是無疑的。</p>

<p>— 方企</p>
<p>歷史的意義</p>
<p>關於廣州辛亥三月革命紀念的意義，一般多注重於牠所引致的五個月後革命成功的後果，　就革命的精神的表現說，這决的意義，實比十月的成功的一次更爲偉大。三月革命是當時國民黨傾全力以　　的一個計劃，所以最足代表革命的性言。牠因爲禾曾　絡就軍隊的響惡，不幸失敗，但如果不是本身的實力，先遣散了一部份，或也足以成功。如果成功，牠將給我們一個純粹人民革命的例子，而雖然失敗，也反加强這性質的顯者。</p>
<p>一些無　英雄</p>
<p>我們如果能有預定發動這次超事的選鋒八百人的整個名表，當　能借以考見性質的廣泛。惟『當選鋒之組織，以求秘密故，惟各部之首領負責，不使他一部人知其名。』而當時負責一方面的領袖，如宋玉琳，李文甫，羅則軍　，都已當時死難，他們所預定　率的部衆的姓名，自然無從知道。至於其他生存的各方面的領袖，在富時失敗之餘，也就不願想到事先已遣散即誤着中的部衆，實則以後如調查個淸楚，當也很有意義。縱然，事光遣散可置不論，常時實際參加幸而牛存的數也不少，現在似也已無從知道他們的全部，其中當也有許多無名英雄，或者今已沒沒以逝，現在的紀念，似乎可以連及他們。</p>
<p>一個有趣統計</p>
<p>單就當時死難者觀察，也很可以看出他們代表着社會各階層的人物。當時死難者的總數，現似尚未能確實完全淸楚。黃花崗下的七十二烈軀，其姓名不同於民八碑表所列的七十二人，事很明顯，因爲其中有死於黃花崗葬事畢後的，有確葬在故鄕的，故七十二自然僅是一代表之數。我們從列有八七五人的名表中，把各烈士的職業，加以歸類，則計有留學生一〇人，文人八人，商人一一人，工人八人，農民獵夫技擊家一一人，曾習軍者一三人，餘二四人不詳，大概也多屬農工。他們大都同屬黃克强所統率，留學生和農民完全同等地站在陣綫上，可見其結合的堅實。</p>
<p>地域的分配</p>
<p>以地域論，各烈士所原屬的籍頁，也分佈　廣。因起　地點關係，自然粵籍人最多，計廣東四九人，廣西七人，其决福建，一九人，而四川，安徽，江蘇各二人，未詳一人。這决計劃中，本定龔占廣州以後，以黃興率一軍出湖南趨湖北，趙聲臺一軍出江西趨南京，別地方的同志，在別處佈置着，所以黃興所屬，僅有川省同志數人，趙聲部屬較多，但事先遣回香港，及再召集，趙部上省的都未到代表機關報到，甚至有領盤費上省而即他逃，謂不滿意軍令之忽退忽進。所以黃興有『李文甫，羅則軍爲難　之歎。趙聲之死，大概和對此情形的憤激有關，可是與難的仍有六人，而宋，趙既死，其他或也遇難的也無人追述，就是六人之中，石德寬，程良，在　一批審定得五十六人的時候，就未獲列人，而華金元，阮德三，徐國泰更未入七十二人之中，可見此外可能還有，這也是値得找同部的曾參加　幸脫險者多查詢一下的。</p>
<p>一位老年烈士</p>
<p>死難者的年齡，除失考者外以上，三十以下，多數都在二十以上，三上以下，可見中國革命自始就是以靑年人為中堅。二十歲以下的一位；三十歲以上的有九位；其中允以江繼復爲特殊，他出身農民，年齡大致已近六十，起事時本凶其年老請他不要參加的，但他却終於奮勇參預，因而烈士中也就有了一位明澈，勇敢的老人的方面的代表了。這種無年齡，無地域，無地位的差別的一致有動，在中國就永遠在生長中。</p>

<p>— 川</p>
<p>戰後我會經在香港有一個短時期逗留，對於那樣一個社曾，自然並沒有怎樣好感。不過有兩件事探深感動我的：一件是義賣獻金；一件是賣紙花募捐。義賣獻金，大都是小商店及小販居多。這地方的確表現出廣東人的『廣東精神』。他們響應國內的獻金運動，情緒熱烈，是別的地方所少見。當一個小販舉行義販的時候，他標明要賣出多少數目要作爲獻金之用，他叫賣，貼標語，似乎瘋在了一般。這樣的情形，常常要引起警察的誤會，認爲擾亂治安，而時加以逮捕，可是一有這樣的事發生，他們的同伴，總出來想法替他解圍，而他義賣的情緒，也因之而更加熱烈，一個小販義賣幾百金，一個很簡陋的商店，義賣幾千金，拿來完全捐爲國家的，那是極平常的事，並且他們之間還有一種好高的競賽，甲義賣五百金，乙爲勝過甲，標明要義賣一千金！甲同業團體擬定義賣幾萬金，而乙同業團體非勝過甲同業團體，獻出較多的數目不可。這樣一來，幾天之內，總貢獻金幾十萬的，那是極平常的事。</p>
<p>獻金運動一年不過幾次，在次數上講，是不如賣紙花募捐那樣多。更有一點不同的，後者大多數是學校裏的女學生，每一朶花的代價也不過一角，募集的款項，也是作爲慈善事業之用。不過一年四季每逢星期六星期日的早晨，香港各行人道上，都密佈着這些賣花女郎。不聞你什麼人，來往於通衢的，就準曾碰得她們，笑臉向着你，請你出一角錢，買一朶花，挿在你的衣襟匕，所以每逢星期六星期日的早晨，只要你曾經出外過的，你的衣襟上都挿了朶花，而戴上了這一朶紙花後，就沒有人再向你兜攬了。這在賣花的人，雖沒有强迫你買的樣利，而在通過的行人，却視爲這是應盡　務。一角錢的數目，在出的人並不多，不過行之既久，自然可以積少成多，變爲一筆可觀的數目，而可以供一筆很大的用塲。</p>
<p>這種辦法，我認爲國內各地的慈善機關，爲籌集基全，救濟難民或其他慈善事業之用，也可以通過地方當局，採甲這種辦法。國內傷兵之友的運動，早已蓬勃一時，而在這沿海的都市，還沒有響應，我們願意各公團各慈善機關，各敎會，都本着人道精神，來爲傷兵努力。上述的辦法，不過聊供一得之見，以資參考吧了。</p>

<h3 id="c124">浙江合作運動的中心麗水 <a href="#c124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>— 申傖</p>
<p>麗水是位於浙東甌江上流，羣山包圍中的一個「山頭」縣分，離開溫州和金華均有三白多里路程，（有公共汽車直達）在抗戰前她靜靜的躺着，沒有引起人們的注意。</p>
<p>「八一三」後浙省許多政府機關，學校，團體，以及「避難」者，紛紛回後方遷移，麗水，因了她是一個「山頭」縣分，多山，變成了他們認為取女全的一塊「福地」，於是紛紛的都向這兒遷移，於是她的人口從十二萬一躍而增至二十多萬　，房租也自數十元一年而躍增至數十元一月，狹小的街道上擁塞着行人，擠得水洩小通。</p>
<p>杭州淪陷後，這裏史顯得熱鬧了，差不多所有的省府重要機關統集中到這裏來了，這時曾有人稱麗水為「小杭州」，的確一這時麗水可以當得起這一呼號，她無形中，已成為浙省政治，經濟，文化，的中心，麗水，在戰後是交上了紅運了！</p>
<p>跟着各機關團體遷到麗水的，這時有一個一浙江省合作事業促進會」，它是全浙從事合作事業的人員所組成，專以推進全浙合作事業為職志的一個合作機關，擁有近千個會員，他們到麗水之後，就決定以這塊未經開墾的處女地為中心，來發動全浙的合作社運動，他們着手開始初步的拓荒工作。</p>
<p>這時在麗水雖然早有「合作社」其名，但是你踏進「台作社」一問，却是什麽也沒有，所謂「合作社」者一塊招牌而已；甚至有少數商人，為免除捐稅起見也掛一塊「合作社」的招牌。民衆對「合作社」根本談不上什麽信用和興趣，大家都視「合作社」為一種多餘的東四，當時「合促會」同志為糾正民衆對合作社歧視的心理，提高「合作社」的信譽，首先，他們就着手於一個比較健全的，資金較濃的，「示範合作社」的組織。經過幾個月的籌備，通過各機關團體的關係，終於他們籌到了一筆不很少的股金，而一所規模相當可觀的麗水　區消費合作社，以簇新的姿態出現了，這所合作社內部分：寄宿，飲食，日用品，糧食等數部，儼似一頁貨公司。一切組織等悉照合作社法，幾個月之後，因該社管理得法，沒有像過去其他合作一般發生『蝕本』『呑款』等不良現象，反之，它的「營業」却蒸蒸日上，於是打破了過去民衆的「合作社是決不會辦得好的」傳統的對合作社不良的觀念，它已留給了麗水民衆對「合作社」極好的影響，種下了麗水合作社運動的幼苗。</p>
<p>在「合促會」積極推動之下，跟着「城區消費合作社」之後在城區　一鄕鎮，都設立了一所「鄉鎭合作社」，合作社在城區巳很普遍的展開了。但是麗水是一個「山頭縣」，她的經濟基礎完全建立在鄕村，尤其剝削關係比城區更複雜殘酷，抗戰中解決農村經濟問題是一件刻不容緩的事情，於是合作工作同志，在麗水城區合作運動稍有眉目時，就積極的深入到農村裏去，開關新園地，但是因為合作幹部的缺乏，鄉村合作社運動並未得到良好的成績，　反的却有為私人或幾個人操縱的小良好的情形　生，但這只是在合作社運動起初發動時總免不了有的一種現象，慢慢的它會被克復下去。</p>
<p>麗水除了在「合促會」同志推動之下所組織的「城區消費合作社」各「鄕鎭合作社」及各鄉村之合作社外，還有二所在「中國工業合作恊會」（屬行政院）扶導之下成立起來的工人生產合作社（編織合作社和皮件合作社）這二所生產合作社是純粹的山生產工人組織起來的，在這中間完全沒有所謂剝削關係存在，加入在這二所合作社為社員的工友，他們每天愉快的勤儉的作着工，為着他們自己，為着合作事業的前途，為着抵制那秘不合理的吃人的剝削度勢力的向上發展！</p>
<p>因了政治的二種原因以致麗水成為今天浙省合作運動的中心，但是麗水的合作運動自　始到現在還保很短的歷史，她並沒有到她「全盛」的「黃金時代」，我相信在浙省當局及全省合作同志積極的扶植之下，不久的將來，麗水的合作運動一定會放出一朶鮮艷的光彩！—我祝福她—</p>

<p>— 範孫</p>
<p>最近幾年來，歐美醫術上又發現了一種新的治療術，就是利甩死屍醫治病人。這種新治療術雖仍在硏究改良之中，可是在醫術上地位的重要不言可知，將使以前羣醫束手的幾種病症有着手成春的可能了。</p>
<p>病人需要血液時，醫生往往用輸血的方法，把別人的血液注射到他的血管裏去，這是大家早巳知道的。可是最近俄國有一位敎授雪諾夫與于廷（Shanov　（Vudin）竟發明了把活人身上甚至死人身上抽取的血液永久保存的方法。這樣一來，以前施行輸血注射時必需臨時由健全的人身上抽取血液，再注入病人身內，現在的新式醫院却可以預先儲備着各種人血佻給醫生隨時取用了。</p>
<p>再據專家報吿，他們已發現人體各器官在人死後有繼續活着若干時間的事實；其活存的時間：少者幾小時，多者幾日，並不一定。美國的科學家能發現死屍中割下的肝臟與腎臟用來接換病人的肝腎臟。</p>
<p>就目前硏究的結果，人死後各器官活存的時間是：腦，十分鐘；心臓的肌肉，二十分鐘；眼，三十分鐘；耳朵，一小時；手臂的肌肉，四小時；血的成分，十八八時；骨，三日；皮膚，五日。這樣看來，醫院中儲備人血之外，又可以加儲各種器官。如果有人害了險症，某種器官必須調換的話，醫生就可以向儲備這種器官的醫院去找相當的替　器官。也許將來還有專門儲血儲器官的醫院的設立啊。</p>

<p>Chongqing: Government officials and newspapers here unanimously declared yesterday that the "Nanjing regime" headed by Wang Jingwei has been "doomed to failure, so all parts of free China pay no attention to the resolutions and orders of the "Nanjing regime."

<h3 id="e14">The Balkans in the European War <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>After the cessation of hostilities and reconciliation between the Soviet Union and Finland, the world's attention has once again focused and shifted to the Balkans. The Balkan Peninsula is located in southeastern Europe, bordering the Mediterranean Sea. Numerous ethnic groups stand side by side, each governing itself, and because of historical grievances, they remain at odds with each other to this day. In addition, ambitious countries surround them on all sides, vying for control, attempting to manipulate them, and engaging in cunning and deceit. Therefore, those with insight view it as a dangerous and explosive powder keg. During the period from 1912 to 1913, the countries of the peninsula were filled with pessimistic separation and division, leading to two Balkan wars. The fuse for the last European war was also located there. Although there has been no exchange of fire in the past twenty years, a diplomatic and economic war is unfolding throughout the peninsula. Examining its background and inferring its impact is closely related to the various countries of Europe.</p>
<p>The Balkan Peninsula is rich in resources, so it is coveted by the great powers, and Germany considers it to be the most important raw material storage area. In total, the surplus food and various raw materials can supply half of Germany's imports. This was true in peacetime, let alone in the current war period. Germany needs the supply of food and raw materials from the Balkan countries to counter the economic blockade of Britain and France. Originally, although Germany is known as a powerful country, its economic resources are actually among the poorest. According to Nazi Germany's plan, the rich resources of the Balkans, such as grains, oils, tobacco, timber, steel, manganese, and aluminum, should be developed on a large scale and preferentially supplied to meet the needs of German industry and economy. However, Germany actually faces many obstacles in this peninsula, making it difficult to control everything as it wishes. During this wartime, due to geographical and military restrictions, there are many difficulties in transportation and transshipment. Although Germany has obtained many conveniences directly and indirectly after making friends with the Soviet Union, the situation between Germany and the Soviet Union is different. Because the Soviet Union's domestic production of steel, oil, wheat, and other products is sufficient for its own needs, there is no need for supplies from the Balkans. Therefore, the Soviet Union and the Balkan countries only need to maintain their emotional and traditional ties. Especially for the Slavic peoples of Bulgaria and Yugoslavia, it is easier to develop close feelings. Therefore, Bulgaria and South Korea seem to be naturally inclined to the Soviet Union. Germany is different. To put it simply, Germany's concern for the Balkans is mainly based on economic interests, while the Soviet Union's is mainly based on political emotions. Because of the difference in these interests, there is currently the possibility of close cooperation between Germany and the Soviet Union in the Balkans. This close cooperation in one area will be a major factor in the evolution of the European situation in the future.</p>
<p>As for Italy's involvement in the Balkans, it seems similar to Germany's. Being close by, it is easy to obtain large supplies of raw materials and it can also serve as an important strategic stronghold to protect its weak Adriatic coastline and its transportation lines with East African territories. Therefore, the policy adopted by Italy in the Balkans is to form a political group as Italy's external defense for European international affairs, and at the same time form an economic group to resist various external economic offensives. However, to date, Italy's achievements in this area are still quite meager and empty. Recently, the leaders of Germany and Italy met in the Brenner Pass. The main topic was naturally the global situation, but it is said that Hitler strongly urged the Italian Prime Minister to get closer to the Soviet Union and clearly provided guarantees, indicating that the Soviet Union would never extend its power to the Balkan Peninsula to avoid threatening Italy. This rumor is difficult to confirm, but there is no need for any other proof that the German side has this desire. However, after investigating the causes and consequences, the Soviet Union also has its demands in the Balkans, such as demanding the return of Bessarabia from Romania. To this day, there is no evidence that the Soviet Union has given up. Even in the case of Germany and Italy, even if there is no question of their attitude towards the Soviet Union obstructing them, the political and economic contradictions between the two countries in the Balkans are also undeniable. Therefore, there are fundamental questions about whether Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union can truly be harmonious in the Balkans. At most, they can only temporarily achieve an adjustment. Furthermore, Britain and France view the Balkans as the most suitable place for investment. For example, Romania's oil, Romania and Yugoslavia's steel, and Yugoslavia and Hungary's aluminum mines are mostly developed using capital from Britain and France. Where investment interests lie, how can they sit back and watch them disappear? Moreover, does the result of their disappearance mean aiding the enemy? Furthermore, the rise and fall of power on the Balkan Peninsula directly affects the safety of Britain and France in the Mediterranean. This is the lifeline of Britain and France. How can they allow it to be cut off?</p>
<p>In summary, the situation in the Balkans is extremely complex. Germany, Italy, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, to varying degrees, all view the friendship and enmity of the countries of the Balkan Peninsula as the key to their safety, danger, good fortune, misfortune, benefit, harm, glory, and ruin. The main cause of the First European War was here, but it failed to achieve a thorough and fair solution. The current European war is not ostensibly for the Balkans, but the final focus may still be the Balkans as its destination. Regardless of who wins or loses, whether or not their territories are damaged or benefited, and whether or not the political views of both sides are judged as right and wrong by the war, the Balkan forces will be the result of this European war. It will create a new hegemony, or that will be the only product of this war! As far as the current situation is concerned, it is not uncommon for the Western European war to be boring and suddenly turn the Balkans into a decisive battlefield!</p>

<p>Tokyo: Today's Budget Committee of the House of Representatives convened at 10:22 a.m. Mr. Kasai Shigeharu (first) and the Foreign Minister held the following question-and-answer session regarding the issues between Japan and the United States and the Japan-Soviet oil agreement: Mr. Kasai Shigeharu asked: "The 'Holy War' has reached its fourth year. Today, when the prospect of handling the incident is still distant, the responsibilities of the diplomatic authorities are even greater. For the past thirty years, Japan has often been let down by the United States. Since the abolition of the Japan-U.S. Treaty of Commerce last year, Japan's diplomacy towards the United States during the incident has been a complete failure. Relations between Japan and the United States, such as the modification of the Treaty of Commerce and American interests in China, have reached their worst state. In my opinion, there is no other way to open up the current situation and make the American public understand Japan's true intentions. What is your opinion?" The Foreign Minister replied: "Japan-U.S. relations have recently deteriorated further. However, I believe that there is still room for opening up relations between Japan and the United States. The government is also taking various measures for this purpose, but I cannot explain it here. The deterioration of Japan-U.S. relations cannot be said to be entirely the responsibility of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It is because the United States does not understand Japan's true intentions. Therefore, the government is working hard to make the United States understand. It is regrettable that the United States has not yet fully understood Japan's true intentions. From the perspective of the traditional national relations between the United States and China, it is quite difficult for the United States to understand Japan's position. However, the Japanese government is still striving to seek its perfection." Kasai asked: "Does the Foreign Minister have any prospects for the Japan-Soviet oil agreement, etc.?" The Foreign Minister replied: "The government hopes that many pending issues between Japan and the Soviet Union must be resolved to adjust the national bites of the two countries. The government is currently negotiating on various pending issues, but it has not reached a compromise." (Domei News Agency, 23rd dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Japanese Foreign Minister Hachiro Arita, when attending a budget meeting of the Lower House yesterday, rejected a suggestion by legislator Miyake that Japan strengthen the Rome-Berlin Axis "to prevent Britain from exerting pressure on East Asia in case it wins the war." According to Miyake, "Japan must abandon its non-joining policy and join the Axis countries to help establish a new order in Europe and a new world order." He pointed out that during the First World War, after Britain won the victory, it exerted pressure on Japan and the Far East. He predicted that this situation would happen again, and that the United States would help Britain to restrain Japan. Miyake criticized Japan for being too close to Britain and France at present. Arita replied, "Japan's non-joining policy cannot be changed, and there is no need to change it at present." (United Press, 23rd dispatch)</p>
<p>Washington: Japanese Foreign Minister Hachiro Arita issued a statement yesterday, stating that the Japanese government is not willing to strengthen relations with Germany and Italy. Diplomatic officials here felt quite surprised when they heard about it, and said that if Japan strengthens relations with Germany and Italy, even if it does not have a substantial impact on the friendly relations between the United States and Japan, it will at least have a psychological impact. In addition, American public opinion has always been in favor of Britain and France, and it remains so. If Japan gets closer to Germany, the difficulties between the United States and Japan will inevitably increase, and the United States will find it even more difficult to consider the issue of concluding a new trade agreement between the United States and Japan. (Havas, 23rd dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: The Chinese Army's official newspaper, Saodang Bao, argued in today's editorial that the United States and the Soviet Union should cooperate effectively in the Far East to make Japan's aggression collapse as soon as possible. According to the editorial, "The countries in the Pacific region, apart from China and Japan, should be the United States and the Soviet Union. As for Britain and France, they are now both involved in Europe, so in terms of sanctioning Japan's aggression, their position is not important. In other words, in the current environment, the most effective way to end Japanese aggression is none other than the cooperation between the United States and the Soviet Union. It is a pity that the United States still cannot be without hatred towards the Soviet Union. It must be known that if the United States continues to harbor unhappiness towards the Soviet Union, it will allow Japan to continue to expand its aggressive actions in China. What Japan is currently praying for most is that both the United States and the Soviet Union cooperate with Japan. Japan is now working hard on this, hoping that both the United States and the Soviet Union will enter its trap. We hope that the peace-loving people of the United States and the Soviet Union will no longer be manipulated by the Japanese." (United Press, 23rd dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: This morning, the Central Daily News published an article titled "British Policy Toward the Soviet Union," urging the British and Soviet governments to cooperate closely. It said that British Foreign Minister Halifax's remarks in the House of Lords on March 19, stating that the British government would not take any measures that would harm British-Soviet relations, were very important. The newspaper continued, "It is regrettable that Britain and the Soviet Union cannot maintain close cooperation. The failure of the two countries to cooperate is not only a serious loss for Europe, but the world is also affected. The current European situation is entirely caused by the lack of cooperation among democratic countries. At the same time, the lack of cooperation between Britain and the Soviet Union not only harms the two countries themselves, but also undermines the power of various democratic countries to promote world peace. Britain and the Soviet Union are both our friends. We hope that British-Soviet cooperation will promote peace in Europe and the failure of aggressors." (Reuters, 23rd dispatch)</p>

<p>Washington - A reporter recently learned from friends of Secretary of State Hull that Hull has no intention of seeking the presidency and will refuse if the Democratic Party nominates him as a presidential candidate. According to these friends, who knew that President Roosevelt fully supported Hull, they had urged Hull to run. However, Hull declined, citing numerous sufficient reasons for not doing so. It is said that when they initially inquired, Hull jokingly replied that he was not yet aware of his eligibility as a candidate. Furthermore, according to sources within the New Deal faction, once Hull's proposed reciprocal trade agreement expansion is put to a vote in the Senate, the calls for Hull to run for president will disappear. This aligns with the aforementioned news that Hull does not wish to be a Democratic candidate. As for Hull's proposal, it has passed the House, and the Senate debate is scheduled to begin next Monday. The reporter also learned that the New Deal faction is deeply concerned about the growing sentiment against a third term and has drafted a plan to nominate Attorney General Jackson as the Democratic candidate if Roosevelt also refuses to run.

<p>Peiping - It has been learned from an independent source that a member of the British consulate and two Canadian missionaries were threatened by anti-British demonstrators in Zhangde, Henan Province. The church's property in Zhangde had been burned and looted. The British Vice-Consul in Peiping, Luo Bainai, along with the two missionaries, obtained passes from the Japanese military authorities through the Japanese Embassy in Peiping and traveled to Zhangde to inspect the situation. They arrived in Zhangde on March 18 and were arranged by the city authorities to stay in a Japanese-owned hotel. At the time, the city was calm, with no signs of anti-British sentiment. However, while they were dining, they suddenly heard a commotion outside and shouts of "Down with Britain" and "Where are the British?". About 30 people then stormed into the hotel and entered the British dining room. Two Chinese men, one holding a bamboo pole and the other a wooden stick with a knife at the end, stood directly in front of the British, performing a war-like dance before attacking the British Vice-Consul and the missionary, Mr. Jin.

It is claimed that the German ambassador to Romania, Fabricius, and the leader of the German economic delegation currently negotiating in Bucharest, Clodius, have not taken any steps against the Romanian government, nor have they presented any ultimatum-like notes. The general impression here is that the purpose of Reuters' dissemination of this news is to obstruct the progress of German-Romanian economic negotiations and to disturb German-Romanian friendly relations.

<h3 id="e27">Germany and Romania Conduct Economic Negotiations; Romania to Send Delegation to London to Negotiate Revision of Bilateral Clearing Agreement <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>Capital of Romania - The claim that the German Embassy presented a "Dear Note" to the Romanian government has been firmly denied by official circles. According to well-informed sources, the Director of Economic Affairs of the German Foreign Ministry, Clodius, has begun negotiations with the Romanian authorities in the past two days. German propaganda personnel are taking the opportunity to spread the above rumors in the hope of confusing the public. In reality, the relationship between Germany and Romania is not like this. Since Clodius arrived here, he has felt that the situation is very unfavorable to Germany, so he is only using diplomatic tactics and dare not act hastily, lest the situation worsen. Take oil as an example. Germany should have received 180,000 tons from Romania every month, but due to the obstruction of navigation on the Danube River, it only received half of that. Britain and France not only purchased all of the amount they were entitled to, but also took the portion left by Germany. As of the 31st, Romanian oil exports totaled 1.38 million tons, of which Germany obtained only 385,000 tons, while Britain and France jointly had 605,000 tons. The remaining 390,000 tons were purchased by Turkey, Greece, and Yugoslavia. Romania still has a portion reserved for Italy. In addition, Romania was supposed to sell a large amount of miscellaneous grains to Germany, but most of it is stockpiled along the lower reaches of the Danube River. Due to the lack of transportation, it is impossible to transport it to Germany. The oilseeds that Romania was supposed to sell to Germany have not been fully purchased by Germany and will have to wait until after the autumn harvest to continue purchasing. At present, the items that Germany purchases from Romania can be expected to increase by a certain amount, but only timber and livestock. Due to these various reasons, Clodius deeply feels that Britain and France have been passive in Romania's early harvest in recent months. If Germany acts too hastily, it will backfire. As far as I can tell, Clodius's mission is nothing more than two things: (1) to study whether the current payment methods between Germany and Romania can be extended to the protectorates of Bohemia and Moravia; (2) to investigate the scope of Romania's new foreign trade system and how it can affect the payment methods between Germany and Romania. At the same time, he also hopes to revise the exchange rate of the German mark and the Czech koruna against the Romanian currency. (Havas dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Bucharest - Romania will send an economic delegation to London in the near future to negotiate a revision of the bilateral clearing agreement. Since the outbreak of the war, British industry has undergone many changes to meet the needs of the war. The items that Romania can purchase in the British market have been greatly reduced, so Romania is eager to revise the bilateral clearing agreement. (Haitong dispatch, 23rd)</p>

<p>Bucharest - The recently signed trade agreement between Italy and Romania is valid until the end of this year. Italy will purchase 450,000 tons of oil from Romania this year.

<p>Paris - According to sources in Helsinki, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, accompanied by several foreign and military advisors, has arrived in Berlin and is preparing to stay for two days.

<p>Berlin - According to senior officials of the National Socialist Party here today, Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov will not come to Germany today, nor during the Easter holidays.

<p>Brussels - According to newspapers here, German diplomacy is unusually active, and an important political event is about to occur. People from all countries should recognize that the German-Italian-Soviet agreement, and even the Soviet-Turkish non-aggression treaty, are likely to materialize.

<h3 id="e30">German and Italian Diplomatic Activities in the Balkans; Division of Spheres of Influence; Both Sides Compete for Supremacy <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>Paris - According to news from the capital of Yugoslavia, the Italian government has sent many representatives to engage in activities in various Balkan countries, in order to promote public opinion in those countries to sympathize with Italy. At the same time, German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop is expected to visit the capital of Yugoslavia in the near future. This shows that Germany and Italy still have the intention of competing for supremacy in the division of spheres of influence in the Balkans. For this reason, although Berlin has said that Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union are about to issue a joint declaration to maintain the status quo in the Balkans, in reality, each country still dreams different dreams. Before taking any joint action, they are all trying to consolidate their own position as much as possible. In addition, Hungarian Prime Minister Teleki is currently visiting Rome. The goal is to inquire about what kind of assistance Italy can give to Hungary. Back in late November of last year, the Italian government made a promise to Hungary, saying that it was willing to assist the country in resisting Soviet attacks. At that time, Hungary and Romania reached some kind of understanding because of Italy's promise. At this point, Germany is doing its best to deal with Romania, hoping to obtain sufficient supplies from that country, so that Italy's efforts in the Balkans, that is, the efforts that once eased the situation there, have been greatly hindered. As a result, it had to change its course and compete with Germany. In short, Italy used to be responsible for promoting the establishment of a joint defense group in the Balkans. Now, it has changed its original attitude and confronted Germany and the Soviet Union, trying to choose the small countries it favors and place them under its direct control. As a result, the Balkans have become a place where Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union are secretly competing. Therefore, it is no wonder that the small countries of the peninsula are uneasy.

<p>London - Reuters has learned that reports from German radio stations that conflicts have occurred between Australian troops and Arabs near Jerusalem and Jaffa are completely untrue. Australian troops have excellent discipline and have very good relations with the Arabs.

In fact, as far as London knows, no Australian soldiers have been sentenced to death by military tribunals. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<h3 id="e34">Near East Military Situation <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>The war on the Western Front of Europe has fallen into a stalemate. Consequently, many military experts are predicting that the war will not only affect the Balkan Peninsula but also spread to the Near East. The possibility of clashes between German and Soviet troops and Allied forces somewhere on the Iranian border plateau, or in the Kurdistan region on the Turkish-Iranian border, or in the mountainous areas on the Soviet Armenian border, is being increasingly rumored. There are also rumors that the Soviet Union intends to attack Afghanistan and the oil fields of Iraq. French General Weygand has also inspected the Turkish border defenses and plans to land troops in Thessaloniki, Greece, or along the Black Sea coast. However, those who expect war to break out soon in the Balkans or the Near East seem unaware of the many difficulties involved in conducting any military operations in these areas. When the reporter discussed this issue with military and diplomatic observers, they all said that conflict in the Balkans is possible, but an Allied invasion of Baku in the extreme south of the Soviet Union or a Soviet Red Army attack on Mosul in northern Iraq is highly unlikely. How the situation in that region will develop in the future will depend on how the war in Western Europe progresses. It is not possible to make predictions too far into the future at this time.</p>
<p>When people generally discuss the military situation in the Near East, they focus on General Weygand's forces stationed in Syria and the support provided by British troops in Palestine and Egypt. There are many strange rumors circulating about the troops under General Weygand. According to reliable sources, the troops in that region total 150,000, all well-trained and well-equipped. If necessary, reinforcements of one or two times that number can, of course, be transferred from French Africa and British India. (Editor's note: According to recent news from Paris, France has concentrated 275,000 troops in the Near East. Meanwhile, a London dispatch also stated that the Allied forces have concentrated 500,000 troops in the Near East. This dispatch was censored by British inspectors.)</p>
<p>With such a large force stationed in the Near East, the Allied forces can be said to have taken preemptive action, deterring Germany and the Soviet Union from acting rashly. If Germany and the Soviet Union attempt to take action in the Balkans or advance towards Iraq, this French force can serve as the basic force in the Near East. The commander-in-chief is General Weygand, a veteran who assisted Marshal Foch in the last European war.</p>
<p>It is generally acknowledged that the future of the Balkans rests on Hitler alone. It is obviously in Hitler's interest to take the Balkans without a fight. If Germany feels a shortage of raw materials this spring or summer, it will inevitably resort to force in the Balkans, and then it will be unavoidable for the Allied forces to contend with them.</p>
<p>However, according to military observers, during the last Great War, it took the Allied forces a long time to deploy their land lines in the Near East. As for the German army, it may be able to invade Romania and northern Yugoslavia within a few weeks, and then, with the aid of the Allied forces, the armies of the Balkan countries will engage in a real bloody battle with the German army in southern Yugoslavia and the mountains of Greece.</p>
<p>This development is possible. Judging from the current situation, the economic war will continue to intensify in the Balkans, gradually brewing into a situation of armed conflict. Of course, Hitler's unpredictable psychology may change the evolution of this situation. In any case, Italy is bound to occupy a position in the Balkan Peninsula. The country opposes both the Allied landing in that region and the German invasion of Yugoslavia, even if they do not invade Romania.</p>
<p>As for the Allied invasion of Baku and the Soviet Red Army's invasion of Mosul, it is generally considered to be a long way off. The borders between Turkey and the Soviet Union and the northern region of Iran present insurmountable difficulties for modern mechanized forces. However, according to military experts, if the war drags on, the Near East will inevitably become a battlefield. In the last Great War, the outcome was decided on the Western Front. Now that both the French Maginot Line and the German Siegfried Line cannot be easily broken through, this European war may be decided in the Near East.

<h3 id="e35">French Chamber of Deputies Voted Yesterday: Reynaud Cabinet Barely Avoided Defeat; Over a Hundred Abstentions, Confidence Vote Barely Passed; Prime Minister Encourages All Factions to Unite and Share the Difficult Task <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>Paris: The French Chamber of Deputies passed a vote of confidence in the new cabinet yesterday with 268 votes against 156, and adjourned until April 2. This vote of confidence only achieved a majority of 112 votes, with as many as 110 abstentions. Although the Reynaud cabinet encountered this setback, it will remain in office. According to observers, the reason why the new government received so few votes is that the public expected the creation of a powerful cabinet dedicated to achieving victory with all its strength, but Reynaud created a government based on the old-style party platform. Although it recruited members from various parties, making it broader than the Daladier cabinet, it is not a truly coalition government of all parties. Moreover, the right-wing factions are deeply dissatisfied with the inclusion of the Socialist Party. The plan to organize a wartime cabinet is welcomed, but the fact that the cabinet members have increased from 27 to 35 is inconsistent with the demands of the newspapers and the public for a smaller and more efficient cabinet. (Reuter dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Paris: After the Chamber of Deputies passed the vote of confidence in the government, the cabinet immediately held a cabinet meeting and decided to continue serving with difficulty. Afterwards, some cabinet members told the press that all misunderstandings between the current cabinet and the Radical Socialist Party have been eliminated, and they will definitely be able to cooperate in the future. According to an official communiqué, "The cabinet held a meeting at the Ministry of Finance, chaired by Prime Minister Reynaud, to study the situation after the Chamber of Deputies passed the vote of confidence in the government. All cabinet members expressed their sincerity to Prime Minister Reynaud and decided to cooperate sincerely. Under these circumstances, Prime Minister Reynaud believes that since the cabinet has obtained an absolute majority in the Chamber of Deputies, it should continue to serve with difficulty. In addition, the cabinet's war affairs meeting is scheduled to hold its first meeting tomorrow morning." (Havas dispatch, 22nd)</p>

<p>Paris: The Cabinet War Committee held its first meeting at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 10:00 this morning, chaired by Prime Minister Reynaud. The attendees included Cabinet Assistant Hédan, Minister of National Defense and Army Daladier, Minister of the Navy Campinchi, Minister of Aviation Laurent-Eynac, Minister of Colonies Mandel, Minister of Finance Lamoureux, Minister of Blockade Monnet, Minister of Armaments Tautée, and General Gamelin, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces. The meeting adjourned at 12:30 noon. Before attending the meeting, Daladier had a long conversation with General Gamelin. In addition, the newly appointed cabinet ministers have all taken office in their respective ministries. Among them, Minister of Propaganda Frossard and Minister Delegate Février, after taking office, immediately ordered the establishment of the Supreme Propaganda Committee within the ministry and appointed Giraudoux as chairman. Giraudoux is a famous playwright and was originally the director of the Information Bureau. (Havas dispatch, 23rd)</p>

<p>Paris: After Prime Minister Reynaud read the policy statement of the cabinet in the Chamber of Deputies this afternoon, the president of the Radical Socialist Party, Chalamel, and Bastid, spoke in succession, expressing dissatisfaction with the excessive number of ministers and delegates in the cabinet and the participation of members of the Socialist Party in the cabinet. Then, Marrain, the leader of the right-wing Republican Democratic Union, spoke, saying that since the new cabinet is neither a wartime cabinet nor a cabinet of national unity, the members of his party will unanimously vote against it. Prime Minister Reynaud then took the podium again and delivered a speech in response. (Havas dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Paris: Before the vote in the Chamber of Deputies, Prime Minister Reynaud replied to the debate, briefly stating that national security used to rely on the army, but today it relies on the entire nation. The mistakes made in the last war must not be repeated now. Prime Minister Daladier has demonstrated his ability in cherishing life (the audience applauded). The responsibility we bear for the country now is to develop weapons most suitable for the new era. Regarding foreign policy, I can abide by the declaration made by Daladier in the secret meeting of the Chamber of Deputies. During the time of the war, it is a crime to allow individual biases to be brought into politics. Therefore, what has been thought and said in the past must not be taken into account (this implicitly refers to the right wing's objections to the inclusion of Socialist Party member Monnet in the new cabinet). The only policy of our foreign policy is to treat friends as friends and enemies as enemies (the audience applauded). The cabinet's declaration is sincere, and we must not disregard any efforts to make the workers understand why we are resisting communism, not because it embraces extreme left-wing teachings, but because we want to eradicate treasonous organizations. The Communist Party has conspired against the country, so we must destroy it (the audience applauded). Freedom is the most precious tradition of France. We are now in the camp of freedom with Britain. We welcome other countries to join the Franco-British group. The compromise and unity of France and Britain do not erase the significance of our Latin national unity. Reynaud continued that he had informed Daladier that he wished to form a new cabinet with his support, and Daladier finally gave his support. Reynaud responded to the criticism of recruiting members of the Socialist Party into the cabinet, saying that the loyalty of the members of the Socialist Party to the country is well known. Today, it is imperative to get the help of all political parties, especially the largest political party in the Chamber of Deputies, in order to solve the war problem. Some have pointed out that the number of cabinet members is excessive. Reynaud said that when ministers are overwhelmed with official duties, their subordinates often act on their behalf. Before the vote, Reynaud concluded his speech, saying that the aim of our foreign policy is to create a new Europe of free nations. The problem of spiritual strength is now as important as the problem of material strength. Our people have been too slow to respond to events. We must promote France to France. If the Chamber of Deputies allows it, the new government will be excited and invigorated to shoulder the difficult task. Our will to fight is to win the only possible lasting peace with the least possible delay. You are about to vote now, which will place a great responsibility on all foreign countries. This war is really putting democracy to the test. We will grit our teeth and seek victory and nothing less, and firmly believe that victory will belong to us.</p>
<p>Then Lebrun rose to speak, saying that the Socialist Party's joining the new cabinet was not prearranged with Reynaud in advance. The reason why the Socialist Party cooperates with the new cabinet is to serve the country with selfless and loyal spirit, and to obtain a just and lasting peace in the shortest possible time with the least possible sacrifice.</p>
<p>The new Prime Minister Reynaud narrowly avoided defeat in the Chamber of Deputies yesterday, but he was not discouraged by it. He has now convened the new War Committee, equivalent to an inner cabinet, to schedule a meeting tomorrow morning in order to encourage France to make greater efforts to fight the war and win victory. Reynaud will now take a ten-day break to wait for Congress to reconvene after the recess, so that he can consolidate his position. The majority of the political circles welcome the government's decision to remain in office. It is generally felt that the fact that many Radical Party members abstained from voting when expressing confidence in the government's motion yesterday is quite puzzling, because the most famous leaders of the Radical Party, such as Daladier, have accepted positions in the new government, so it is difficult to believe that the party is opposed to the government. It is now generally believed that Reynaud's decision to forge ahead and face everything will result in gaining the support of the majority. An analysis of yesterday's vote in the Chamber of Deputies shows that out of 109 Radical Party members, a total of 10 voted against the government, including the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, Mistre. 48 abstained, and 2 party members were absent. Therefore, the actual number of votes in favor of the government was 49. It is found that the Radical Party has a total of 10 ministers and 1 delegate in the new government, with 1 delegate. The new government has a total of 22 ministers and 13 undersecretaries. (Reuter dispatch, 22nd)</p>

<p>Oslo: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently issued a communiqué stating that the country's ambassador to Germany has delivered a note to the German Foreign Ministry protesting the country's naval warfare methods. The note stated that the naval warfare methods used by your country have caused our country to lose many ships, such as the "Eindritt"号, "Sonja"号, "Dambo"号, "Egga"号, and other ships that have successively sunk. Our government, based on the current international law and the wartime inspection regulations promulgated by your country, believes that it has the right to demand that your country's navy not attack the cargo of neutral countries' ships coming to our country, that is, our country's ships sailing to the enemy of your country, as long as they do not carry contraband, there is no reason to attack them. In short, according to international law, your country's navy cannot justify attacking neutral countries' ships in the open sea because they are forced to accept inspection by enemy warships. Our government believes that your country must share this view in principle, but the ships of our country have recently been repeatedly attacked, and therefore we have no choice but to propose that representatives of the two countries conduct negotiations as soon as possible to discuss this issue, so as to reduce the dangers to our country's overseas shipping and thereby guarantee its external supplies. Please let us know as soon as possible whether your government agrees to this proposal. (Havas dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Amsterdam: London reports that the Danish ship Christianborg, 3,270 tons, and the Norwegian ship Sventa, 1,267 tons, were both sunk by torpedoes near the east coast of England. The Christianborg is the sixth Danish ship to be lost in British territorial waters in the past three days. The Sventa was hit by a bomb and damaged during a German air force attack on merchant ships escorted by British ships in Scapa Bay on the 10th. Now it has been attacked by a torpedo and will eventually sink. It is fate. (Haitong Agency dispatch, 23rd)</p>

<p>Milan: According to消息 received here, when the US Undersecretary of State Welles was aboard the Italian mail ship "Conte di Savoia" passing through the port of Gibraltar, a team of British sailors suddenly boarded the ship for inspection and ordered all passengers to line up to check their passports. It is said that the British side received news that the former German Minister of Economy, Schacht, was traveling to the United States under an assumed name, but after searching for thirteen hours, nothing was found. Passengers made a lot of noise, and the British sailors returned in disappointment. (Haitong dispatch, 23rd)</p>

<p>Berlin – According to inquiries made by the Havas News Agency, regarding the circumstances of the German fighter shooting down a British plane: Yesterday afternoon, German planes and British planes engaged in fierce combat in German airspace. The British plane was destroyed and crashed on the Dutch side of the Rhine River. Two pilots attempted to parachute to safety, but unfortunately, one parachute failed.

<p>London – According to news received last night from the coast of Norfolk, an enemy plane attempted to bomb the Cromer lightship yesterday. The Cromer lifeboat was prepared to set out, but did not. This lightship is located twenty-five miles offshore and is not equipped with self-defense capabilities, nor does it have communication equipment with the shore. This is the third lightship off the Norfolk coast to be bombed by enemy aircraft. (Reuter's dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>London – The Admiralty has just announced: "On the 20th of this month, three squadrons of our aircraft, while escorting a merchant convoy over the North Sea, engaged in air combat with a squadron of ten German Heinkel bombers. Our aircraft first opened fire on the approaching enemy aircraft. The German planes threw their bombs into the sea to reduce their weight, then quickly disappeared into the clouds and hastily fled. Shortly after, several enemy planes emerged from the clouds again, attempting to attack the merchant convoy. At this time, our aircraft had already dispersed. Only one aircraft bravely engaged with four enemy aircraft and eventually drove them away. This was at 7 PM. At 7:30 PM, a squadron of our aircraft, returning from escorting a merchant convoy from the North Sea, saw an enemy plane being pursued by three of our coastal patrol aircraft. They also joined the pursuit, but the enemy plane ultimately escaped without a trace. Our aircraft pilots also saw another enemy plane strafing a merchant ship with machine-gun fire. They took advantage of its unpreparedness, flew to a high altitude, and from a position of height, attacked it suddenly when they were fifty yards apart. The enemy plane's fuel tank was hit and it fled in disarray. Our plane ran out of ammunition and could not pursue it. According to a public announcement issued by the German General Headquarters, 'One of their country's aircraft failed to return to base, which probably refers to this incident.'" (Havas dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<p>Berlin – According to news from the German official news agency, one of the German bombers participating in the attack on the British convoy, which was reported missing yesterday, has reached the German coast despite being heavily damaged. (Reuter's dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>Germany Claims Sylt Island Not Damaged by Bombing</p>
<p>London – The British Air Ministry has just stated that the British aircraft that flew to the German island of Sylt on Wednesday to conduct reconnaissance have confirmed the success of the night raid on Tuesday and have taken photographs. However, due to the activity of enemy anti-aircraft guns and fighter planes, they could not fly close enough to take satisfactory photographs. Therefore, the photographs taken do not indicate the extent of the island's material losses. (Reuter's dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>Amsterdam – An American journalist published a report after inspecting Sylt Island, stating briefly that the hangars and other facilities at the Hörnum German Air Force base were undamaged. The British public has expressed doubts about the success of the British air raid, and the fact that British reconnaissance planes flew to Sylt Island after the raid to take photographs but have not yet released them, leads to the general speculation that these photographs cannot actually prove the official reports. (Havas News Agency dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>Berlin – According to the "People's Observer," after inspecting Sylt Island, journalists from various countries proved that the British Air Force's retaliatory action for the bombing of Scapa Flow was a complete failure. Foreign journalists in London have also requested to inspect Scapa Flow to verify the German Air Force's "failure" news, but First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill and Secretary of State for Air Kingsley Wood have refused the inspection, citing Scapa Flow as a strategic military point that should be kept secret. However, the British side is claiming that the German planes only bombed non-military targets. Sylt Island is also a strategic military point, but foreign journalists still went to inspect it, as they did with the Kiel Canal and Wilhelmshaven, to prove that the truth of the British-reported bombing was untrue. Neutral country citizens can now verify, through the results of on-site inspections by their own journalists, that Sylt Island has not been damaged by bombing.

<p>(Chengdu, 22nd) The Sichuan Education Supervision and Normal Education Conference held its first general meeting at 9:00 AM on the 22nd. More than 100 members attended, presided over by Guo Youshou, Director of the Department of Education.

Subsequently, the responsible personnel from the Department of Education reported on the current situation of education promotion in various parts of Sichuan Province.

<h3 id="e51">Children's Day Preparatory Committee Creates Children's Welfare Badges: A Badge is Given for Every Dime Donated, Proceeds to Build a Library <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Ninth Celebration Children's Day Preparatory Committee is actively promoting the construction of a children's library. It is reported that the committee, in order to promote fundraising, has ordered 100,000 children's welfare badges. The design is very exquisite and moving, with a picture of children reading and drawing at the center. The slogan above is "Knowledge is Power." Anyone who donates a dime will receive a Class B children's welfare badge, and anyone who donates one yuan or more will receive a Class A children's welfare badge as a souvenir. According to Chen Zhengfan, the general secretary of the committee, since the committee decided to build a children's library, it has received letters from all sides (including children) expressing enthusiastic support and willingness to help complete the fundraising goal. Now that the committee has ordered 100,000 children's welfare badges, it is confident that they will be completely distributed in a short period of time. If they are insufficient, a second and third batch will be added. What we hope is that on the Fourth of April Children's Day, whether it is a university professor, an elementary school student, or even a chauffeur, everyone will wear a children's welfare badge, indicating that they have made a contribution to children's welfare. Whether our country has been modernized and whether the citizens of Shanghai truly care for children, we will not find it difficult to obtain clear evidence of this.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Education previously provided public-funded and partially public-funded places in various national secondary schools to provide relief to secondary school students in war zones. Recently, the above-mentioned relief funds have been uniformly changed to loans, and the implementation of loan measures for students in war zones has been promulgated. Now, the Ministry is following the request of National Ninth Middle School that normal school students should be treated as public-funded and should be different from loans, and that they should be exempt from meal fees. The Ministry of Education has approved this and issued an order for all national secondary schools to follow.</p>
<p>The normal school branch of National Second Middle School, originally located in Beibei, was part of National Second Middle School. Now, in order to improve and expand normal education as national education is about to be implemented, the Ministry of Education has ordered the school to be established independently and renamed National Chongqing Normal School, adding special normal classes and simplified normal classes. This semester, one hundred female physical education normal school students will be recruited first.</p>
<p>In order to improve the teaching facilities of national secondary schools, the Ministry of Education has sent Gao Weichang, a member of the Henan Provincial Party Headquarters, to Henan to inspect National First Middle School. Provinces and private colleges above the junior college level are also sending personnel to inspect and assess the schools, and this will be handled separately one after the other.</p>
<p>The private Wuchang China University believes that there is an urgent need for accounting talents from all sides. It plans to add an accounting specialization to the College of Commerce starting this spring in order to train accounting talents. It is reported that it has been submitted to the Ministry of Education for approval and record.</p>
<p>In order to cultivate excellent teachers for secondary schools, the Ministry of Education has formulated the Second Division enrollment measures for various normal colleges in the 29th year [of the Republic of China, i.e., 1940] and ordered the various normal colleges to prepare for Second Division enrollment. It is reported that the Lantian National Normal College, as it was newly established in the 27th year [of the Republic of China, i.e., 1938], does not yet have students in the third, fourth, and fifth grades, and advanced courses have not yet started. Establishing a Second Division would be somewhat difficult in terms of curriculum. It has already been approved by the Ministry of Education to temporarily postpone the establishment of the Second Division.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education previously formed three roving drama education teams to carry out education in the provinces of Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong, Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan, Guangxi, Guizhou, and Yunnan. Now, a fourth team has been added and Li Puyuan has been appointed as the team leader to depart for the provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai to work.</p>

<h3 id="e53">International Cup Loss is a Pity: China Narrowly Defeated by One Goal, Portugal Wins Championship 3-2, Controversy Over Penalty Kick <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>In this year's International Cup Football Championship, the Chinese team faced Portugal yesterday afternoon at 3:30 PM at the Yu Garden. The audience was at least 15,000 to 16,000 people, a grand occasion no less than the Christmas Charity Match. The two sides were evenly matched, tense and exciting. Portugal's Favan Xiao took the lead, and Cao Qiuting equalized. The first half ended in a 1-1 tie. After switching sides, Favan Xiao scored again. To make matters worse for the Chinese team, Cai Shengsen suddenly left the field due to a dislocated shoulder. Fortunately, Xu Wenkui was fouled by Victor inside the penalty area for knocking down Cao Qiuting. The resulting penalty kick broke the net, making the score 2-2. Five minutes later, Favan Xiao violently collided with Meng Yiliang in the Chinese team's goal area. The referee, Pan Tuo, unexpectedly ruled Meng had committed a foul, showing blatant bias. The audience was in an uproar. Costa then scored the penalty kick, putting Portugal ahead 3-2. The army did not intend to fight again, but in order to maintain the spirit of sportsmanship, they endured the pain and continued the game. As a result, they ultimately lost narrowly by this goal, suffering a 3-2 defeat. It is reported that the Chinese team will file an appeal, but given the established facts, the organizers may not be able to handle it fairly. After the game, Major General McNorton, a member of the Appeals Committee, presented the awards, and the silver cup was continuously preserved by the Portuguese team. Yesterday's lineups for both sides were as follows:</p>
<p>Portugal</p>
<p>M. Soares, Marshall, Victor, Remedios, Costa, Silver, Attigue, Rocha Liao, Favan Xiao, Colasa, Remedios</p>
<p>Chinese Team</p>
<p>Qin Bigao, Li Yichen, Yan Shixin, Cai Shengsen, Meng Yiliang, Wang Cuixing, Wan Jin, Sun Jinshun, Cao Qiuting, Xu Wenkui, Jia Youliang</p>
<p>Excellent Performance</p>
<p>Yesterday's performance was very exciting. Both sides were young heroes, dribbling quickly, making it a rare and exciting game this season. The Chinese army lacked a center forward, and the attacking power was considerably reduced. Wan Jin was very satisfied, while Jia Youliang, who had been away from the battlefield for a long time, performed only so-so. Gaps in the defense were visible. Li Yichen saved many dangerous situations and was indeed a meritorious official. The Portuguese army's offense was very fierce, and the defenders Marshall and Victor were more experienced than us. This is also why the Chinese army repeatedly failed to attack.</p>
<p>Evenly Matched</p>
<p>The Portuguese team asked for the ball, but was blocked back by our iron army. Li Yichen was stationed in the back, repeatedly saving dangerous situations. The Chinese team launched a counterattack, but failed to score. At 22 minutes, Portugal's Favan Xiao received a pass from Souerfo, dribbled past Li Meng, and swept the ball sideways, the ball flew out like an arrow, straight into the net. The Chinese team was not discouraged. Sun Tui sent a pass to Wan Jin, Wan did not try to take credit for himself, but passed it to Wenkui. Wenkui passed it too quickly and it went wild. At 32 minutes, Wan Jin got the ball and handed it to Tui, Sun's shot also hit the goalpost. Sun rushed to hook it back, and Cao Qiuting waited perfectly, jumping lightly, and the ball went into the net in response, tying the score at 1-1. The audience roared. Before long, Jia Youliang got the ball from the back, headed it to Wenkui, Xu shot it into Soares' arms. Later, Wenkui got the ball and passed it to Youliang, Youliang hooked it and Qiuting headed it towards the goal, but it was caught by Soares again. The first half ended with a 1-1 tie, evenly matched.</p>
<p>Calamity Strikes</p>
<p>After the lemon, the Chinese team's lineup changed slightly, with Wan Jin and Cao Qiuting switching positions to increase the offense. At 10 minutes, Costa sent a long shot, and Favan Xiao rushed straight into the Chinese army's territory, Yan Shixin failed to return to rescue in time, and the ball was scored again, 2-1, Portugal took the lead. Before long, Cai Shengsen collided with Silver, his arm dislocated, and the Chinese army had to fight with only 10 players. Three minutes later, Jinshun passed the ball to Qiuting, Victor acted roughly and knocked Cao down, resulting in a penalty kick. Xu Wenkui scored into the right corner, 2-2, tying the score again. At 18 minutes, Favan Xiao shot, Qin Bigao lay down and扑住获救. Two minutes later, Favan Xiao charged head-on, Meng Yiliang was knocked down and retreated three steps, the referee Pan Tuo unexpectedly ruled that Meng had committed a foul. Chinese team captain Sun Jinshun protested verbally to no avail. Costa then scored the penalty kick, and the Chinese team lost a goal unjustly. The Chinese generals were filled with anger and endured the pain and continued the battle, but this blow affected their morale. The Portuguese team took the opportunity to become rampant, and Qin Bigao became the target of everyone. Fortunately, Qin was agile and was not breached. As a result, at 2-3, the Chinese army ultimately lost the box office by one goal, and the Portuguese team retained the championship.</p>

<p>Jianbei Sports Association Chairman Ding Du and General Secretary Cheng Shuming, in view of the rising popularity of ice skating in Shanghai, but the lack of ice skating team organizations among the various sports groups, and the fact that many members of the association are requesting organization, have decided to first prepare to organize an ice skating research class, and have hired ice skating star Ding Jinfu to serve as instructor. The first preparatory meeting is scheduled to be held at 8:00 PM tonight at the Yong'an Ice Skating Rink on Nanjing Road.

<h3 id="e58">Inauguration of the Pseudo-Central Market; Vegetable Industry Expresses Strong Opposition; Preferring Closure to Forced Participation; British Troops Install Military Telephone at the Gap <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>British troops opened a gap in the barbed wire on North Tibet Road, specifically for the entry and exit of people and goods from the "Pseudo-Central Market," but declared the right to lock it at any time. Recently, to strengthen defense, a military telephone was specially installed yesterday. The "market" held an opening ceremony yesterday, and British troops and concession authorities implemented temporary security measures, which were soon lifted. The Japanese puppets are pressuring the vegetable industry to participate, and the industry has made a strong statement. The details of the situation are as follows:</p>
<p>British Troops Install Military Telephone</p>
<p>The Scottish troops stationed in the "B" area of North Tibet Road, north of Suzhou Creek, at the request of the Japanese Marine Corps, opened a gap in the "B" area's barbed wire to allow people and goods from the pseudo "Central Market" to enter and exit. However, before granting the Japanese request, they declared the right to close it at any time. According to reports from the Daguang News Agency, the Scottish troops stationed in the "B" area, although a new guard post has been set up in front of the "market" gate, with soldiers stationed inside in shifts, are still concerned about the lack of means to transmit messages when necessary. To strengthen defense, a military telephone line was specially installed at the gap in the northern area, one end connected to the guard post, and the other directly to the Scottish military headquarters at the racecourse on Mahe Road, to facilitate the immediate transmission of reports and orders.</p>
<p>Japanese Puppets Gather; Concession on Alert</p>
<p>The pseudo "Central Market" held an opening ceremony at 10:00 AM yesterday. In addition to representatives from the Japanese military, the pseudo "Mayor," the pseudo "Director of the Social Affairs Bureau," and other Japanese puppets of all sizes attended. Following a pre-arranged bizarre ritual, the opening ceremony was hastily conducted. Subsequently, the Japanese puppets held a meeting inside the "market's" Sihang Warehouse to discuss vegetable management methods. The Japanese puppets, to prevent unforeseen circumstances, sent several Japanese navy personnel as escorts and plainclothes guards. The gate of the venue was wide open, with a dozen pseudo-police officers strictly guarding the entrance. Entry was not permitted without special permission. A notice was posted in front of the "market" gate, stating, "The yellow cards issued by this venue will be temporarily suspended today. This announcement." Judging by the language and the security situation, it was extremely strict. Around the "market" gate, British troops and the Public Concession police also secretly dispatched soldiers and detectives to distribute and implement temporary security measures, searching pedestrians, calming the situation, and avoiding misunderstandings among residents. Security measures were lifted only after the Japanese puppets dispersed at noon.</p>
<p>Vegetable Industry Makes Strong Statement</p>
<p>When the "market" opened yesterday, white cloth banners were posted to deceive the public, specifying the opening and business days (business date: 15th). To understand the situation, a reporter from the Daguang News Agency made a special visit to a major vegetable merchant, who said that the Japanese puppets' organization of the "Central Market" was intended to control the entire Shanghai vegetable monopoly. A small number of corrupt elements in the vegetable industry were enticed to join the "market," but they do not represent the entire industry. It is rumored that merchants in the 16th Bend, Laozha Bridge, and Caojiadu areas will be forced to participate. While this is indeed a last resort, those with a conscience are determined not to collude. According to what I know, at least 90% of people would rather close their businesses than participate. This kind of pressure from the Japanese puppets is also a "stubborn" move. It is heard that the vendors in the Hongkou Triangle Vegetable Market who have agreed to participate in the "Central Market" under the influence of the Japanese military are all Japanese and White Russians, not Chinese.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Coal and Firewood Industry Association sent a letter to all members yesterday, stating: "Regarding the resolution on coal briquettes at the members' meeting of the association on the 18th of this month, it is requested that the coal briquette industry (1) factories should not engage in retail sales, but should supply retail stores with the amount of coal briquettes in stock; (2) the price difference between wholesale and retail should be stipulated to maintain the livelihood of retail stores, and coal powder should still be exchanged for coal briquettes at a 10% discount as usual; (3) delivery by truck, each according to previous practice, and purchase notes that are generally used in Shanghai should not be refused. Major factories should supply coal powder to small factories to increase coal briquette production. The above opinions were submitted to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Public Works Department, and other departments on the 20th, and representatives were sent to petition. Now, a letter from the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce on the 21st has been received, stating that three points of opinion have been raised by the industry regarding the mechanized coal briquette industry, instructing to discuss with the association and fully accept and earnestly implement them. This matter has been discussed with your representatives, and with regard to the distribution of coal briquettes in stock to retail stores as much as possible, please report the actual needs of your industry in a book so that the association can forward the letter to the association and coordinate the distribution of the production volume of each coal briquette factory. Please do so as soon as possible. This has been received. It is found that the association has already sent personnel to carry out the investigation of the actual sales volume of coal briquettes in each store since the 21st of this month in order to speed up the process. However, it is found that a small number of member stores have not been contacted due to the absence of those in charge, and have not reported to the association, which is greatly delayed. It must be known that the investigation and reporting of the actual sales volume is the basis for future unified distribution, and it is also a necessary procedure in the process of solving the difficulty of purchasing goods. Conversely, it means giving up its requirements. It is hoped that the same industry stores will have a thorough understanding. If there are omissions in the investigation and the numbers are inaccurate and must be corrected, please contact the association before the 24th of this month so that they can be entered in the book. This notice is hereby issued."</p>

<p>The Shanghai Postal Administration, after complying with the Japanese request, allows the public to purchase stamps with Japanese banknotes and Japanese military notes. However, according to reports from the Datong News Agency, the branch offices in the two concessions still refuse to use them. Even the Chinese public in the post offices in the occupied areas of Shanghai suburbs have never used Japanese banknotes and Japanese military notes to purchase stamps. Regarding the incident of the public being able to open remittances to Hankou and Jiangxi using Japanese military notes, because it violates postal regulations and at the same time uses Japanese military envelopes for shipment, and also opens an evil precedent in the history of remittances, it has attracted the attention of all sectors. According to reports from the Datong News Agency, postal branch offices in the two concessions have also not accepted the development. However, they have been found in post offices in various occupied areas of Shanghai suburbs, but only for Japanese personnel. The Chinese public can deeply understand the general righteousness and never attempt to use them.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Hotel Industry Association, because the Public Works Department increased the business license tax for members of the industry to more than one and a half times in order to balance revenue and expenditure, has sent letters to the Chinese Taxpayers Association of the Public Concession and to the Chinese Director Yu Qiaqing, requesting assistance, and sent a letter to the Public Works Department to withdraw the order. The Public Works Department has now replied. The department is scheduled to host all Chinese directors today. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Reply from the Bureau</p>
<p>The Public Works Department replied to the Hotel Industry Association yesterday, stating, "In reply to your letter of March 18, the Public Works Department is now increasing the business license tax for Chinese-style apartments, and the tax should have been collected in full from April 1, 1934. The previous preferential treatment is still maintained. Now, it is reiterated and organized, and in accordance with the previous resolution, full collection will begin from April 1, 1940. We regret that this matter cannot be reconsidered."</p>
<p>Host Chinese Directors</p>
<p>A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency learned from the Hotel Industry Association yesterday that the industry has received a reply from the Public Works Department, stating that there is no room for consideration regarding the increase in the business license tax for Chinese-style apartments, which is quite worrying. However, considering that tax collectors must first cultivate the tax source, and that this tax increase is unprecedented, it has been scheduled to host all Chinese directors at the Hong Kong Road Bank Club at 12:00 noon today. Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Ludeng, Xi Yushu, Guo Shun, Jiang Yiping, and others will be invited to attend at that time.</p>

<p>Various industry associations and labor unions in the city have published statements in newspapers to deny participating in certain activities. As a result, the inside story of a certain party has become clearer and clearer. Then, an organization called the "Special Operations Headquarters" sent letters to various industry associations, issuing warnings with extremely threatening language. The original text is recorded below: "To the person in charge of the guild, We have investigated and confirmed that Your association has "deep understanding of righteousness" and is able to protect "peace". It is especially admirable that You serve the "leader" and care about the future of the "Party and State". The delusional elements still have not awakened and continue to engage in last-ditch struggles, not hesitating to use "despicable means" to spread terror, or even trying to exert "influence" by printing blank papers in order to obstruct "peace". Such "schemes" can only lead to ruin. Your noble association has seen through their schemes and cannot be swayed by them. We are afraid that if the "lawless" continue to incite disorder. Any wavering person may fall into their trap. Therefore, this letter serves as a warning.

<h3 id="e74">Regulations Stipulated by the Ningbo Navigation Authorities: Safety Measures for Lighters - Taking Preventative Measures to Ensure Future Safety - The Ningbo Navigation Administration Has Ordered Shipping Companies to Comply <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>During the wartime period in Zhejiang Province, the Bohai Navigation Administration Office and the Ningbo Navigation Affairs Office, directly under the Ministry of Transportation, investigated the incident on March 2nd of this year, where the lighter *Jing Sheng Lun* capsized while ferrying passengers in port due to an air raid, resulting in a tragic disaster. The event occurred suddenly, making rescue impossible and causing deep regret. However, it is never too late to mend the fold. To ensure future safety, the following eight measures have been jointly formulated:</p>
<p>Lighter Transportation Based on Vouchers</p>
<p>1.  From now on, when various shipping companies in Ningbo sell passenger tickets, they should simultaneously collect the lighter fee and issue a separate lighter voucher. The voucher should have a clearly numbered serial number (the format will be determined separately). One day before departure, the shipping company should publish at each pier the passengers who should be on each lighter, based on the lighter voucher number and the departure time from the specific pier. Additionally, a large sign should be placed at each pier stating, "Passengers with Lighter Vouchers numbered X to Y should board Lighter Z," so that passengers can board the correct ship according to their number, avoiding overcrowding and overloading.</p>
<p>2.  Inspection soldiers at each pier should check passengers' lighter vouchers. Only those with matching voucher numbers should be allowed to board the ship in an orderly manner; otherwise, they should be stopped.</p>
<p>3.  The prohibition of small boats carrying passengers for illegal ferrying will be the responsibility of the Ningbo Inspection Team stationed on the ships.</p>
<p>4.  For large pieces of luggage that passengers cannot carry themselves, or for hand luggage exceeding two pieces, the shipping companies will be responsible for handling luggage ticket procedures and collecting luggage fees. Upon arrival, the shipping companies will properly return the luggage to the passengers.</p>
<p>5.  Before the departure of a large vessel, all crew members or laborers going ashore should return to the ship on the last lighter of the day. If the lighter is full, other arrangements must be made. They must not casually board the lighter to avoid disrupting order.</p>
<p>Strict Prohibition of Overloading</p>
<p>6.  When passengers from Shanghai are transferred to lighters outside Zhenhai Port, the chief officer on the ship should assign capable personnel to work with Zhenhai inspectors to implement the following measures: (A) Passengers should board the lighters from the middle wheel in an orderly manner, without rushing. (B) Absolutely no passengers or luggage should be loaded onto the wheel. (C) Each lighter is absolutely forbidden from overloading; it must leave the large vessel once full. (D) Sailing lighters are not allowed to carry passengers.</p>
<p>7.  The Zhenhai Inspection Team will dispatch several soldiers to the area outside Zhenhai Port to maintain order and supervise.</p>
<p>8.  When lighters outside Zhenhai Port arrive at the Ningbo pier, personnel from the inspection team should work with crew members to implement the following measures: (A) Small boats are not allowed to pick up passengers mid-route. (B) When the lighter approaches the pier, footmen are strictly prohibited from boarding to solicit business. (C) All travelers should be notified to maintain order. Passengers should only disembark in an orderly manner after the lighter is securely docked and the mooring ropes are fastened.</p>
<p>Regarding the above measures, except for items 3, 7, and 8, the Garrison Headquarters has been requested by telegram to comply with and enforce them. Yesterday, the format of the lighter voucher was copied and sent to the Zheng County Shipping Business Association, ordering them to quickly forward it to the various shipping and lighter companies for compliance. The date of compliance and details of the implementation should be reported for record.</p>

<p>Since the outbreak of the European War, the sources of various raw materials in this city have become more expensive than before, especially cotton yarn. Recently, Singapore has also restricted the import of goods from countries not using the gold standard. However, various textile products in this city have not been significantly affected. Currently, the amount of various textile products in this city sold to Europe or Southeast Asia has increased sharply compared to before. Factories have added night shifts and increased production to meet demand. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>British Market Needs are Particularly Pressing</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the European War, the sale of textile products from this city to the British, French, and other European markets has increased compared to before, especially in various British markets, the need is even more pressing. According to news from the domestic goods industry in this city, the quantity sold to the UK has increased by about seven or eight times compared to before. If the war continues, the sales of Shanghai textile products in British and French markets will inevitably increase daily. The main reasons are: (1) British and French factories have mostly converted to manufacturing all wartime necessities to adapt to the needs of the war. (2) Due to shipping relations, the sales of textile products from Canada and Japan to the UK and France have decreased, providing a good opportunity for Shanghai textile products.</p>
<p>Sales Expansion in Southeast Asia</p>
<p>Furthermore, the sales of Shanghai textile products to various territories in Southeast Asia are particularly active. Although the Singaporean authorities have banned the import of non-gold standard goods, only a small portion falls under the ban. For the most part, local merchants can request permission to transport and sell goods as needed. Moreover, markets in the Dutch East Indies, the Philippines, and South Africa are gradually expanding. It is expected that the sale of Shanghai textile products to the above areas will tend to increase. However, the dumping of inferior and counterfeit textile products has encountered some setbacks. If publicity is effective, so that local overseas Chinese can deeply understand the value of Shanghai textile products, the sales of Shanghai textile products in Southeast Asia are truly limitless.</p>

<p>The drivers of the four major car rental companies in this city, Xiang Sheng, Yun Fei, Yin Se, and Tai Lai, requested a 20% increase in their fuel allowance. After the drivers' representatives formally made the request to the company management, the driver representatives dispatched eleven representatives to the Da Hu Ballroom on Jing'an Temple Road at 4:00 PM the day before yesterday for lengthy negotiations. However, the company side believed that the request was unreasonable, while the labor side argued that it was difficult to maintain a living. The opinions of both parties could not be reconciled for the time being, so after a long discussion, a satisfactory result was not achieved. Both parties have now decided to postpone the negotiations until the afternoon of the 29th of this month. The drivers are currently working as usual, awaiting a reasonable resolution.</p>

After extensive inquiries by reporters from the Chinese News Agency, reliable sources revealed that the Japanese side had decided to order all gambling dens in the Huixi area to close by the 29th of this month. If the gambling dens stubbornly refuse to heed the warning and deliberately set up gambling operations to entice gamblers, they will be handled according to the closure procedures for the Nanshi district, and the arrested gamblers and den owners will be prosecuted, etc. It is also reported that large gambling dens such as Hollywood and Victoria are willing to close voluntarily and are now looking for sites in Macau, while other, more well-capitalized establishments are also seeking properties in Macau.</p>

<p>Since the French Concession's Board of Directors promulgated the General Occupational License Regulations, a large number of tax office personnel are being dispatched to conduct surveys of various industries within the concession in four districts to serve as a basis for taxation. The taxation method is based on the rental value of the business location. For the convenience of businesses, the Daguan News Agency reporter has specially recorded the tax amounts as follows:</p>
<p>Class A includes food stores, vegetable stores, butcher shops, rice stores, cooked meat stores, dairy food stores, etc. Class B includes laundry services, canned food stores, grocery stores, braised food stores, and all other commercial and industrial establishments that do not belong to Class C. Class C includes banks, silver companies, businesses or companies that manage or rent real estate, cosmetic shops, photo studios, beauty salons, embroidery and fashion stores, legal advisors and litigation agents, business agencies, and insurance agency offices, etc. This plan is based on the tax payment methods for various commercial and industrial occupations. Taxes are paid every six months. Industries not specified in the General Occupational License Regulations promulgated by the French Consulate General under Order No. 589 are exempt from taxation.</p>
<p>Also, the French Concession Board of Directors is levying a general occupational license tax from this year onward, and lawyers are also included in the levy. The Shanghai Lawyers Association believes that this type of tax will have a great impact on the entire association. Yesterday, it sent a request to the Ministry of Judicial Administration to forward the matter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for a reasoned negotiation. Yesterday, the association issued a notice to all members, explaining the progress of the request and stating that it had not yet received a reply from the supervising official and that further notice would be given upon receipt of the results.</p>

<p>Rice prices in Wuxi have been gradually trending downwards in recent days. Compared to the highest peak last month, high-quality white japonica rice has fallen by three or four yuan per stone from 30 yuan. Although rice millers have continued to order large amounts from the Japanese, a continuous stream of paddy rice boats has arrived from neighboring areas, no fewer than sixty or seventy vessels, and there are still large quantities arriving in port. Currently, there are more than 20,000 dan of paddy rice accumulated in the river docks. Market sentiment is bearish, and merchants are eager to sell. With limited buyers, the supply is abundant, digestion is sluggish, and rice and paddy rice prices have continued to fall by one yuan to five or six jiao. On the 21st, high-quality white japonica rice opened at 25 yuan and 6 jiao to 25 yuan and 2 or 3 jiao per stone, unpolished japonica rice at 24 yuan to 23 yuan, and japonica paddy rice at 12 yuan, 4 jiao, and 5 fen to 12 yuan per dan.</p>

<p>Previously, all grades of bituminous coal were in high demand due to spot shortages, and black market prices once reached as high as 250 or 260 yuan. However, due to the high cost, bathhouses are now switching to white coal, and the sales to the boiled water industry have also been reduced due to the supply of cheap coal ash. Sales in this street are inevitably subdued, and prices have fallen. Indian ash is currently priced at 230 yuan per ton, Kaiping No. 1 ash at 225 yuan, No. 2 ash at 220 yuan, and Keelung coal at 215 yuan, delivered to the customer's house, including the cost of carrying.

<p>Currently, whether for Chinese or Western clothing fabrics, woolens are all increasing in price. Comparing the current market with that of the previous two years is like comparing heaven and earth. Among Chinese clothing fabrics, the most popular and best-selling are thin plain serge, Walter cloth, and thin fancy woolens. What used to cost 70-80 cents a foot now requires at least two yuan per foot at the cheapest. Walter cloth, fancy woolens, and summer cloth that previously sold for 1.70-1.80 yuan a foot were already considered top-grade. Now, even at 3.50 yuan a foot, they are not necessarily satisfactory. To obtain pure wool British woolens, one must spend 5-6 yuan per foot. For Western clothing fabrics, what used to be considered high-end at 15-16 yuan a yard now costs 25-26 yuan and is still considered ordinary low-grade goods. Consequently, the average price for a custom-made suit at a Western clothing store is around 150 yuan in legal tender. Suits that cost 100 yuan in the previous two years could afford top-quality pure wool woolens.</p>
<p>Regarding textile exports, 76 pieces were shipped to Saigon on the 23rd, and 55 pieces were shipped to Siam. On the 24th, 140 pieces and then another 120 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong, 25 pieces to Guangzhou Bay, 985 pieces to Haikou, and to Haiphong.</p>

<p>The tinplate market has not been very active recently, as high prices have reduced actual sales for factories and merchants are also being cautious. Yesterday, the entire city only traded a few hundred boxes, mainly involving factories and businesses from Tianjin and Yantai. However, market conditions have slightly improved compared to before. There are reports of rising prices for overseas orders, and supply sources are not smooth. Speculation continues, with 180-pound Double Crown tinplate selling for 195 yuan per box, 180-pound American Double tinplate selling for 205 yuan per box, and 200-pound American tinplate requiring around 215 yuan per box, all about five yuan higher than before. However, large 24-gauge tinplate has decreased by 1,000 yuan per box, while 26-gauge large tinplate from British and Italian sources is selling for 380 yuan per box, and American goods require 430 yuan per box.</p>

However, recently, due to tight credit and unease in the market, the purchase of these goods by these firms has significantly decreased, resulting in quiet daily trading. Some out-of-town firms are still shipping goods, but in small quantities. Prices have not fluctuated much, with Ma Brand cement selling for 24 yuan per barrel, white cement for 80 yuan per barrel, and 3-4 fen bamboo-joint steel bars quoted at 1,050 yuan per ton, and 5-1 cun bamboo-joint steel bars selling for around 1,000 yuan per ton.</p>

<p>Beat, Beat, Beat</p>
<p>The Hengsheng Tea Shop in this port, due to a dispute between Cantonese workers and local workers over tea frying, was reported to the Mixed Court. Magistrate Chen ordered the seriously injured Shen Rende and two others to be handed over to the county for investigation. Yesterday, Magistrate Mo Zun read out that hiring workers should be at the master's discretion, as had already been instructed in previous proclamations. How could they gather a crowd and act wildly? After examining Shen Rende's injuries, which were very minor, he ordered him to be beaten with 40 strokes of the rattan. Shen also claimed that the injury to his foot was indeed serious, so he was beaten with another 20 strokes of the rattan and locked up at the main gate. The other two were not even examined for the severity of their injuries, but each received 40 strokes of the rattan and were detained for further investigation. He also declared that even if all Cantonese workers were hired, local workers must not compete for the jobs. Violators would be severely punished. Some people said that hiring should be at the master's discretion, and local workers dared to compete with Cantonese workers, the fault lies here, not there. However, since the Western doctor had already confirmed that Shen Rende had serious internal injuries, it would be acceptable to reprimand him and ignore the injuries. Instead, he first beat him because the injury was minor, then beat him again because he claimed the injury was serious, and finally, he beat the other two without even asking if they were injured. In short, it was all about beating. Yao wanted to execute him three times, but Zixia advocated pardoning him three times. Magistrate Zun ordered to beat him three times, hence the direct title: Beat, Beat, Beat.</p>
<p>Two Old Men Fight Each Other</p>
<p>The other day, in a certain lane in Yangzhou, two old men fought each other. One was 81 years old, and the other was 73 years old. They grappled with each other. The 73-year-old man sustained serious injuries and was carried home, where he died within half an hour. His family wanted to seek justice, intending to sue, but stopped when they heard that the other old man had also died from injuries. Alas! If he had died, he would truly have died innocently. In the Hong Fan, the five blessings are: first, longevity; fifth, a peaceful end. But even those who are long-lived cannot enjoy all the blessings. How stingy heaven is!</p>

<h3 id="e106">Family Life and School Life <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>— Nv Wan</p>
<p>Children, let's calculate how much time we spend at home and how much time we spend at school. Suppose a child goes to school at 7:00 AM and leaves at 4:00 PM, they only spend nine hours at school and a full fifteen hours at home. Although this isn't the case for every child, we generally spend more time at home than at school. If our family life is well-organized and orderly, then our school life will surely be fulfilling and insightful.</p>
<p>At home, we interact with our parents and siblings, and life is relaxed and free. Although a strict father might urge and teach you, the love of a kind mother often makes you lazy and idle. At school, we interact with teachers and classmates, and life is disciplined and regulated. If you do something wrong, your classmates will point it out and ridicule you, and the teacher will severely reprimand you, forcing you to improve yourself. Thus, family and school life cannot be connected and cooperate with each other. For example, in science class, we learn that eating snacks is harmful, but when we return home, we buy and eat whatever we want. At school, when it's our turn to be on duty, we sweep the floor and wipe the desks, but at home, we don't even bother to tidy up our own clothes and books. If we continue like this, how will our studies improve, and how will our lives be fulfilling and enjoyable? Therefore, the connection between family and school life, in addition to requiring the help of teachers and parents, also requires the children themselves to be at the center and make efforts to connect them. Be a good student at school, a good child at home, and a good citizen for the country.</p>
<p>How can we make family and school life cooperate? Here are a few points to tell you:</p>
<p>(1) At school, we only gain knowledge, such as not eating snacks, not lying, working diligently, being neat and clean, etc. There are many things we are told to do, so you must not only know but also apply them to our family life and see if the results can satisfy you.</p>
<p>(2) Around our homes, there are many uneducated people who don't know that cold water contains bacteria, that vegetables contain vitamins, so you should tell them so that everyone has common knowledge.</p>
<p>(3) Have a regular family life. At home, it should be like at school, with fixed times for eating, sleeping, reading, and playing, so that our lives are orderly and we complete the day's work from beginning to end. Then, we won't feel inconvenienced by time at school either.</p>
<p>If you are willing to do as said, plus children's self-exhortation and hard work, then our lives will surely improve and be valuable.</p>
<h3 id="e107">From the Seventy-Two Martyrs to Mr. Huang Xing <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>— Long Ju Sheng</p>
<p>Children, time flies so fast. In just four more days, it will be the 29th anniversary of the martyrdom of the Seventy-Two Martyrs of Huanghuagang. To admire the martyrs and commemorate them with deep sorrow, we must not "forget our ancestors." The National Government authorities, due to the period of resistance and nation-building, specially re-stipulated that the memorial days of Mr. Deng Zhongyuan's martyrdom on March 23, Mr. Hu Zhantang's death on May 12, Mr. Chen Yingshi's martyrdom on May 18, Mr. Liao Zhongkai's martyrdom on August 20, Mr. Zhu Zhixin's martyrdom on September 21, and Mr. Huang Xing's death on October 31, etc., be merged into the Revolutionary Martyrs Memorial Day and held at the same time. These many martyrs were all contributors to the creation of the Republic of China and are worthy of being recorded in history for eternity. The author will briefly discuss the historical facts of the Seventy-Two Martyrs to Mr. Huang Xing for the children to read!</p>
<p>The Seventy-Two Martyrs: In the third year of the Xuantong reign of the Qing Dynasty (1911), on March 29, revolutionary Huang Xing (Ke Qiang) and others led a rebellion to attack the Governor-General's office of Guangdong and Guangxi. Naval Admiral Li Zhun led his troops to arrive, and the revolutionaries were defeated. The troops that were supposed to respond also did not mobilize, so the event failed. Xing was injured and escaped, and the other martyrs who died, according to the investigation at the time, numbered seventy-two, so they were called the "Seventy-Two Martyrs" and were buried together at "Huanghuagang" (now northeast of Guangzhou City, at the foot of Baiyun Mountain). Therefore, they are also known as the Huanghuagang Martyrs. After the founding of the Republic of China, the day of their uprising was designated as Revolutionary Martyrs Memorial Day. In the eighth year of the Republic of China, Lin Sen and others repaired their tomb and successively found out the names and native places of the Seventy-Two Martyrs and engraved them on the monument to be passed down forever.</p>
<p>Mr. Huang Ke Qiang: Revolutionary leader Huang Xing, styled Ke Qiang, was talented in literature and had great courage. In the late Qing Dynasty, he advocated revolution with Mr. Sun Yat-sen. In the Dingwei year of the Guangxu reign (1907), he launched an uprising in Hekou, Yunnan. After the failure, he fled to Vietnam. In March of 1911, he led a crowd to attack the Governor-General's office in Guangzhou and was defeated again by Li Zhun, suffering injuries but barely escaping. After the Wuchang Uprising in October, he fought a great battle with the Qing army in Hanyang. After the recovery, the Nanjing government was established, and he served as the Minister of the Army. Later, Yuan Shikai took office as president, and the government moved north. Xing stayed to guard Nanjing. After Song Jiaoren was assassinated, he rose up to oppose Yuan without success and fled to Japan. He later went to Nanyang and died in Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e108">The Unstoppable Clock <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>— Su Ming</p>
<p>The clock ticks, ticking away, the pendulum swinging from left to right, from right to left endlessly. The long and short hands race each other on the clock face day and night. Although the long hand walks very fast, often passing the short hand and leading the way, the short hand is still unwilling to be outdone, persevering, not feeling discouraged by its slowness, still inching along like a snake, step by step, but sometimes it can walk ahead of the long hand. It turns out they are holding a round-robin race! But after walking like this for about a week, they finally rested together, because their driving force - the spring - had become exhausted, so the clock stopped walking. Zong'er is the starter who commands them to continue the race again. It turns out that the work of winding the clock in his house has always been his responsibility, because he is taller and stronger, so this work is of course easy for him, but whenever he hears his mother calling him to wind the clock, he always can't muster up his interest, even though his younger brother - Yong'er - is very happy to wind the clock, his mother doesn't ask his younger brother to go, but insists on calling him to do it.</p>
<p>"If there were a clock that never stopped, that would be great. I wouldn't have to do this thing I don't like to do anymore," Zong'er muttered as he wound the clock.</p>
<p>Yong'er said with a sarcastic tone: "Then leave it for you to invent."</p>
<p>"Don't mock me, this kind of clock that never stops has already been invented in the eighteenth century, but unfortunately, too much time has passed, and it has been lost to this day, but some astronomers can recall it, and it is possible to manufacture it again, but it has not been successful." These words aroused Yong'er's attention, and he hurriedly asked Zong'er what it was like?</p>
<p>"This kind of non-stop clock works by absorbing the endless power it needs from the surrounding environment. It is based on the principle of a mercury barometer, because the atmospheric pressure changes from time to time, the mercury goes up and down, and the pointer also shakes non-stop. Applying this movement of the barometer to the clock, the clock can run permanently without our care. It is said that its structure is very complicated, almost like a large-scale mercury barometer: there is a mercury glass pot hanging on a horizontal frame, and inside the pot is a long-necked glass tube containing a mercury gall bottle, these two things are actively connected, which is a very ingenious lever. When the atmospheric pressure is high, the mercury in the glass tube is pressed down and the mercury pot is raised, and when the pressure is low, the opposite happens. This two-way motion allows the small gears on the clock to rotate in one direction. If the air pressure does not change, the gears will not move, and the clock will stop. Then there is the power of a pre-stored hammer falling to activate it, and the clock will run again. But after the hammer falls, it is not easy to make it rise, and at the same time, the shaking force of the air pressure is also difficult to apply, and the lifting of the hammer must have a certain regularity. These kinds of difficulties have not yet been overcome, and the price of this clock is much more expensive than the current clock, and it is also very bulky, so no one is happy to use it until now."</p>

<p>— Yi Mu</p>
<p>At this moment, he had to walk up a mountain ridge made entirely of red stones. There wasn't a single blade of grass on the ground, and his feet hurt as he stepped on it. There wasn't even a protruding rock above him to shield him from the terrifying sunlight. It was just past noon, and the scorching sun shone on the uneven mountain path, and even the air was still and filled with heat. Hans was thirsty and exhausted, in great pain. He kept looking at the water bottle hanging on his belt, thinking to himself, "Three drops of water would be enough, even if it can't quench my thirst, it can at least cool my lips."</p>
<p>He opened the water bottle and brought it to his mouth, but his eyes saw a small thing lying on the rock beside him, seemingly moving. It turned out to be a puppy, obviously struggling with death from extreme thirst. Its tongue was stretched out of its mouth, its gums were dry, and its limbs were limp. Black ants were crawling around its lips and throat. At this time, it widened its eyes and looked at the water bottle in Hans's hand. Hans drank the water in the bottle himself, kicked the dog with his foot, and continued forward. He didn't know why, but he felt a strange shadow suddenly appear in the azure sky.</p>
<p>The mountain path became more and more inclined and uneven. The air in the high mountains not only didn't feel refreshing, but seemed to make his blood burn. The sound of the waterfall rushing down mocked him in his ears, because it was very far away, and his thirst was increasing minute by minute. After another hour, he looked at the small bottle at his waist again. Although the bottle was already half empty, it still had more than just a drop left. He stopped, opened the lid of the water bottle, but just at this moment, he saw something moving on the mountain path above. It turned out to be a pitiful child, half-dead, lying on the stone, also extremely thirsty, his chest constantly rising and falling, his eyes closed, and his lips burning with dryness. Hans glanced at him indifferently, drank the water, and continued forward again.</p>
<p>A smear of grey-brown dark clouds covered the sunlight, and snake-like shadows slowly spread across the mountainside. Hans struggled forward, exhausted beyond belief. The sun was sinking, but it still didn't feel cool. On the contrary, he felt that the suffocating and heavy air was pressing down on his head and heart. Fortunately, the destination was gradually getting closer. He saw the Golden River waterfall jumping out from the mountainside, less than five hundred feet above his head. He stopped, took a breath, and rushed forward.</p>
<p>Just then, he heard a weak cry. He turned around and saw an old man with white hair lying on the stone. His eyes were sunken, his face was as pale as death, and a look of despair was all over his face. He stretched out his arms to Hans and shouted weakly, "Water! Water! I'm dying of thirst." Hans replied angrily, "I don't have any water. You've lived long enough for your age." So he stepped over the stiff body and strode upward.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Christ is Risen (In Commemoration of the Resurrection Day of the Lord Jesus) <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Jesus' death was a contribution in the negative sense, while resurrection and ascension are positive contributions. Without Jesus rising from the dead, we would have no living hope. Jesus was handed over for our transgressions and was raised to justify us. Since we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, having been reconciled, we shall be saved through His life. If Jesus had not been resurrected, our faith would be in vain and would not differ much from other religions. When evening came, there was a rich man from Arimathea named Joseph, who was also a disciple of Jesus. He went to Pilate and asked for Jesus' body, and Pilate ordered it to be given to him. Joseph took the body, wrapped it in clean linen cloth, and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had cut out of the rock. He rolled a large stone in front of the tomb's entrance and left. Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were there, sitting opposite the tomb. The next day, the day after Preparation Day, the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered before Pilate and said, "Sir, we remember that while he was still alive that deceiver said, 'After three days I will rise again.' Therefore, command that the tomb be made secure until the third day. Otherwise, his disciples may come and steal him away and tell the people that he has risen from the dead. Then this last deception will be worse than the first." Pilate said, "Take a guard and secure it as well as you know how." So they went and made the tomb secure by sealing the stone and posting the guard. When the Sabbath was over, at dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to look at the tomb. Suddenly there was a great earthquake, because an angel of the Lord descended from heaven, rolled back the stone, and sat on it. His appearance was like lightning, and his clothes were as white as snow. The guards were so terrified of him that they shook and became like dead men. The angel said to the women, "Do not be afraid, for I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified. He is not here; for he has risen, just as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay. Then go quickly and tell his disciples: 'He has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you to Galilee. There you will see him.' Now I have told you." So the women hurried away from the tomb, afraid yet filled with joy, and ran to tell his disciples. Suddenly Jesus met them and said, "Greetings!" They came to him, clasped his feet, and worshiped him. Then Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee; there they will see me." While the women were on their way, some of the guards went into the city and reported to the chief priests everything that had happened. When the chief priests had met with the elders and devised a plan, they gave the soldiers a large sum of money, telling them, "You are to say, 'His disciples came during the night and stole him away while we were asleep.' If this report gets to the governor, we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble." So the soldiers took the money and did as they were instructed. And this story has been widely circulated among the Jews to this very day. Then the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go. When they saw him, they worshiped him; but some doubted. Then Jesus came to them and said, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age." Therefore, the Lord Jesus in whom we believe is not sleeping in the tomb but is alive in heaven, because He is the Son of God and cannot be held by death. The Holy Spirit in our hearts also bears witness to this. He is the vine, and we are the branches. The foundation of Christians is stable in heaven, so no matter what suffering we endure, it cannot be destroyed or diminished, for He is the head of the church, living forever and ever.

<h3 id="e111">The Future of Color Films <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>—維特</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, as long as science progresses, the film industry in the entertainment world will also improve. According to the current general preference for watching movies and those who use movies as a pastime and entertainment, they are most satisfied with color films in their minds. Facts prove that "Robin Hood" and "Gulliver's Travels" both made exaggerated publicity of their color components, so the box office was naturally good. Therefore, I say that in the future of movies, color films will inevitably eliminate the entire situation of black and white films, which is inevitable. Let me tell you the reasons:</p>
<p>Movies can capture all the activities of people or other animals into the lens and re-project them. The only regret is that they cannot capture the natural scenery into the film. The green waves, the tender green leaves, and the scarlet flowers, when we look at them on the silver screen, are still just black and white mixed pictures. Although this picture is not annoying, it is not as moving as the real thing. In order to cater to the psychology of the audience, smart filmmakers add color to the black and white pictures, which is color films. However, this kind of color film is often too exaggerated, and some places are somewhat distorted.</p>
<p>American film engineers are studying the method of making true color films with "single roll" camera. Only a set of soft films coated with various colloids is used. After exposure, it can be obtained by special development method. The film of "natural color", but this new method has not yet been successfully researched, but it will definitely be realized in the near future, and black and white films will undoubtedly suffer a very unfortunate fate.</p>
<p>The meritorious officials of color films are Frederick.E.Ives, Charles Urban, Albert, G.Smith, etc., but these are all researchers of color films fifty years ago, and there are still many unknown meritorious officials who are participating in the development of color films.</p>

<p>Since the outbreak of the "August 13" war, artists in various departments of literature, art, film, drama, and music have launched their own salvaging organizations, such as salvaging drama troupes and singing troupes, and have been developing to various places to do their work. However, these organizations are mobile and mostly independent. After more than 30 months of war, they have gradually become fixed and concrete organizations. The reporter has learned that these organizations are located in the rear, and they are recorded below to inform the gentlemen who care about art. In Chongqing: there are the "National Drama Association", the "National Literary and Art Circles Anti-Enemy Association", the "China National Music Circles Anti-Enemy Association", and the "National Cartoon Writers Association Sichuan Branch". In Guilin: there are the "National Cartoon Writers Association", the "Literary Association Guilin Branch", and the "Literary and Art Workers Association".

<p>The Lan sisters, who starred in "Four Daughters", and their sworn sisters Jian'er Panqi, have become famous since the release of the film "Four Daughters" last year; countless audiences have written letters to congratulate them, praising their artistic skills, and hoping that they can continue to act in more lovely films. Seeing that they have such appeal, the film company immediately signed a five-year contract with them. The four sisters also agreed with the company to set a five-year plan, preparing to specialize in films about "Four" in these five years. In addition to "Four Daughters" and the current "Four Wives", they will continue to star in "Four Mothers", "Four Divorced Wives", "Four Sins", "Four Broken Mirrors Reunited" and other four, four, four, ... and other films, please readers wait and see!</p>

<p>"The Romance of the Golden Bracelet" is a new play written by Mei Wanhuashi. It was performed several times on the sea three years ago. Although there is no bizarre plot in the middle, there is singing and acting. To add color to the plainness, those who do not have considerable cultivation in Peking Opera performance will not be able to do it well. Ms. Jiao Hongying, a famous female ticket, is the daughter of Jiao Ding鏜, a famous lawyer in Shanghai. She is twenty years old, intelligent, and excels among her peers. She is also kind-hearted. In her spare time from reading, she is very fond of Qingyi and Daoma operas. Whenever there are obligatory charity events that invite Ms. Jiao to participate, she is happy to perform, regardless of the cold or heat. I have seen her performing "Yu Shi Feng", "Visiting Mother", "Yu Tang Chun", and "Rainbow Pass", and I sighed that she is a beautiful talent endowed by heaven. Recently, Ms. Jiao's father joined his father's Disaster Relief Entertainment Conference and performed this play, playing Jiang Qiulian. After three days of separation, I was really impressed. When she was beaten by her stepmother, her delicate and tactful expression, and the new tune of Manban Erhuang were presented one after another. Her singing and acting skills have reached a pure and mature state. The scene of picking firewood is the most exciting part of the whole play. She sings "Nan Bangzi" to ask the wet nurse to communicate the meaning of Liu Chunfa's desire for a phoenix to her. She expresses her difficult feelings, shy and hesitant, sometimes sad and sometimes happy, one sentence is one color, which is really wonderful. We admire Ms. Jiao, who is pleading for the disaster-stricken compatriots, and her kindness is reminiscent of her father's style. However, the excellence of her artistic skills is just a trivial matter, so I am happy to record it.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Wen Tianxiang Performed Yesterday <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>—游記者</p>
<p>This time, the Refugee Association hosted a disaster relief entertainment conference at the New World, and the Shanghai drama circle also participated in a charity performance. "Wen Tianxiang" is the most exciting and successful of the five one-act plays. Although the original author of this script, Kong Linjun, has left Shanghai, this precious drama he left to the "isolated island" drama circle has been performed countless times by many drama groups.</p>
<p>The performance results of the four plays "Father Returns", "After Returning Home", "Shikumen", and "Elopement" are also good. Compared with them, the story and dialogue of "Wen Tianxiang" leave the audience with many exciting and profound ideas. Hundreds of viewers applauded enthusiastically and instinctively.</p>
<p>The story of "Wen Tianxiang" is worth introducing. It is written about the end of the Southern Song Dynasty, when the Yuan soldiers invaded the Song Dynasty. Song Prime Minister Wen Tianxiang was ordered by King Yi to raise the King-Protecting Army and resist the Yuan soldiers with all his strength. Unfortunately, he was captured. After surrendering to the Yuan Dynasty, Song traitor Zhang Hongfan wanted to persuade Wen to surrender, using all kinds of threats and inducements, but Wen refused to surrender and asked for death generously. In this short one-act play, the exposure and depiction of loyalty, treachery, good, and evil exert the highest dramatic power. In addition to "Regret of the End of the Ming Dynasty", "Wen Tianxiang" is the best compact and short one-act play of this year.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Martyrdom of the Love Saint <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>—企華</p>
<p>"Martyrdom of the Love Saint" is the work of Kilbling, the author of "Gonggeting". So when Courmont went blind and his masterpiece was destroyed, he was sent to the battlefield, leading the way and rushing to the natives' fire line, and "martyred" for the "country". But with the beginning and end cut off from the "war of aggression", "Martyrdom of the Love Saint" has a very moving story: a painter who became famous could not get the love of his childhood lover. Before his last masterpiece was completed, he knew that his eyes would be blind; this stimulation made him work harder to paint, but this masterpiece was also destroyed under the hatred of "Checkertl".</p>
<p>This story can't help but remind me of Cherkibauyu and Irene Deng's "Love Pet in the Painting", but the director of "Martyrdom of the Love Saint" cannot make this moving story jump vividly on the screen, but instead makes people feel dull. Here are a few examples: (1) When Dick knew he was going to be blind; (2) His painting was destroyed, but he didn't know it yet, and gave it to Macy to watch. (3) Bessie told him that she had painted over the painting; the directors of these three important plays did not tightly grasp the tragic atmosphere, especially (2) When Dick uncovered the cloth, the audience laughed instead. At the same time, the relationship between Dick, Macy, and Bessie is not clear enough. This shortcoming, the story is too long is naturally a major reason, if the opening uses three subtitles to introduce three times and places, you can see the director's difficulty in dealing with this story.</p>
<p>Courte's play is hard-working, but for the above reasons, it cannot give people a deeper impression. Ida Robino's Bessie is "impersonating", laughing loudly (this is also the best-handled play in the whole film) and saying that she has painted over the painting fully depicts the "melancholy" character.</p>

<p>Diao Ban Hua seems to have changed from the past, a passionate person has become as cold as ice, not only that, but also always refuses guests behind closed doors except for filming, and her whereabouts can hardly be found in the social circles. She came to Shanghai alone from Hong Kong last year and joined Yihua Company. She only filmed one "Wang Baochuan", and the appearance is very good. It can be said that Diao Ban Hua is very destined for ancient costume films. This spring, Yue Feng re-directed "Yan Xijiao" in Yihua. Beforehand, the candidates for the protagonist were determined to be two, one was Yu Sulian, and the other was Diao Ban Hua. Later, after everyone considered, they thought that Yu Sulian's egg was too square, and her speech had the Qi school style, so they decided to use Diao Ban Hua. The male protagonist who matched her was Mei Xi. Sure enough, Diao Ban Hua was very careful this time, and completely made out the identity of "Yan Xijiao" as a literary and flirtatious person. Yue Feng said: Diao Ban Hua is going to be popular this time. Diao Ban Hua herself also said: This time, she can finally do the play properly. It can be seen from this the outline of the content of the film.</p>

<h3 id="e119">National Tomb-Sweeping Day <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>—塵</p>
<p>The National Tomb-Sweeping Day of the Republic of China in 1929 is coming in a blink of an eye. Today, when the land is crisscrossed by wars, we feel the greatness of its significance even more.</p>
<p>In order to commemorate the sagely emperors, enlightened kings, famous ministers, and good generals who have made great contributions to our nation, such as the Yellow Emperor, Emperor Wu of Han, Emperor Taizong of Tang, Emperor Taizu of Ming, Yue Fei, and Qi Jiguang, we specifically designate Qingming Day as the National Tomb-Sweeping Day, and hold ceremonies to sweep their tombs to show our respect. At the same time, we take them as role models, inherit their legacy, and maintain the glorious history of the past. This is the original intention of holding this ceremony, which began in the Republic of China in 1923.</p>
<p>Counting on our fingers, it has been seven years since then, and the enhancement of national consciousness in these seven years has been truly progressing by leaps and bounds. When we look at history, we know that the Chinese nation has a special characteristic, that is, the more foreign enemies invade, the stronger and more energetic the unity among the nation becomes. "Adversity strengthens the nation" is probably what it means. Therefore, since the outbreak of the July 7th Lugouqiao War, although a line or a point of territory has been temporarily occupied, the glory of the nation has not been frustrated as a result; on the contrary, it has become more and more glorious.</p>
<p>Another characteristic is the persistence of national struggle. When we look at it, after foreign races entered and occupied the land in the past dynasties, folk secret organizations united by national consciousness flourished and lasted for a long time; in addition, the fierceness of revolutionary groups at the end of the Yuan Dynasty and the end of the Qing Dynasty all prove that although the Chinese nation is temporarily trapped in subjugation on the surface, the hearts of the people do not die even after hundreds of years. Once there is an opportunity, they will rise up and restore the country. What's more, the current government is not only unharmed in strength, but also becoming stronger day by day. This point, on the eve of this National Tomb-Sweeping Day, can be used to comfort the spirits of many national heroes in heaven.</p>
<p>Ancients said, "Strong grass is known in a strong wind, and heroes are recognized in troubled times." In today's war of resistance, except for a few who are willing to be slaves, thousands of national heroes, named or unnamed, have died for the country on the battlefield, so the National Tomb-Sweeping Day after the completion of the war of resistance will inevitably be more grand and enthusiastic than it is now, which is undoubtedly.</p>

<p>The Meaning of History</p>
<p>Regarding the significance of the Guangzhou March Revolution of 1911, the general focus is on the consequences of the successful revolution five months later. In terms of the expression of the revolutionary spirit, the significance of this decision is even greater than the successful one in October. The March Revolution was a plan that the Kuomintang devoted all its efforts to, so it best represents the revolutionary nature. It failed because it had not yet fully won the support of the army, but if it were not for its own strength, and it had dispersed part of it in advance, it would have been sufficient to succeed. If successful, it would give us an example of a purely people's revolution, and even if it failed, it would strengthen the manifestation of this nature.</p>
<p>Some Unknown Heroes</p>
<p>If we could have the entire list of the 800 pioneers who were scheduled to launch this incident, we would be able to examine the breadth of the nature. However, "the organization of the pioneers is for the sake of secrecy, and only the leaders of each department are responsible, so that other people in the department do not know their names." And the leaders who were responsible for one aspect at the time, such as Song Yulin, Li Wenfu, and Luo Zejun, have all died at the time, so the names of the masses they had planned to lead were naturally impossible to know. As for the leaders of other aspects who survived, after the failure of the riches, they did not want to think about the masses who had been dispersed or mistakenly hit in advance. In fact, it would be very meaningful to investigate and clarify them in the future. Even if the dispersal can be ignored, there are many who actually participated and fortunately survived at that time, and now it seems that there is no way to know all of them. Among them, there must be many unknown heroes, or they have already passed away unnoticed. It seems that the current commemoration can also include them.</p>
<p>An Interesting Statistic</p>
<p>Judging from the dead at the time alone, we can also see that they represent people from all walks of life. The total number of dead at that time does not seem to be completely clear yet. The names of the seventy-two martyrs under Huanghuagang are different from the seventy-two people listed in the People's Eight Stele Table, which is very obvious, because some of them died after the Huanghuagang burial, and some were buried in their hometowns, so seventy-two is naturally just a representative number. From the list of 875 people, we classify the occupations of each martyr, and there are 10 students studying abroad, 8 scholars, 11 businessmen, 8 workers, 11 farmers, hunters, and martial artists, 13 who had studied in the military, and 24 who were not detailed, and most of them probably belonged to farmers and workers. They mostly belonged to the command of Huang Kecheng. Students studying abroad and farmers stood on the front line completely equally, which shows the firmness of their combination.</p>
<p>Geographical Distribution</p>
<p>In terms of region, the original籍页 of each martyr is also widely distributed. Due to the relationship of the starting point, naturally most of them are from Guangdong, with 49 people, 7 from Guangxi, 19 from Fujian, and 2 each from Sichuan, Anhui, and Jiangsu, and 1 unknown. In this plan, it was originally decided that after Gong occupied Guangzhou, Huang Xing would lead an army out of Hunan to Hubei, Zhao Shengtai would lead an army out of Jiangxi to Nanjing, and comrades from other places would be deployed in other places, so only a few comrades from Sichuan Province belonged to Huang Xing, and there were more subordinates of Zhao Sheng, but they were sent back to Hong Kong in advance, and when they were recalled again, Zhao's subordinates who went to the province did not report to the representative organization, and some even took travel expenses to the province and fled, saying that they were dissatisfied with the sudden advance and retreat of the military order. Therefore, Huang Xing had the sigh of "Li Wenfu and Luo Zejun are difficult to manage." Zhao Sheng's death was probably related to his anger at this situation, but there were still six people who had difficulties, and since Song and Zhao had died, no one mentioned the others who may have also encountered difficulties. Even among the six people, Shi Dekuan and Cheng Liang were not included in the batch of 56 people who were determined, and Hua Jinyuan, Ruan Desan, and Xu Guotai were not included in the 72 people, which shows that there may be others besides this. This is also worth asking the comrades who participated in the same department and fortunately escaped to inquire more about.</p>
<p>An Elderly Martyr</p>
<p>The age of the dead, except for those who are unknown above, most of them are above 20 and below 30, which shows that the Chinese revolution has always been based on young people from the beginning. One person is under 20; there are nine people over 30; among them, Jiang Jifu can be regarded as special. He was born as a farmer, and his age was roughly close to 60. When the incident occurred, he was originally dissuaded from participating because of his old age, but he finally bravely participated, so there was also a representative of the clear and courageous old man in the martyrs. This kind of unity without age, region, or status difference is forever growing in China.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Thinking of the "Friends of Wounded Soldiers" Movement from Selling Paper Flowers for Donations <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>— Chuan</p>
<p>After the war, I stayed in Hong Kong for a short period, and naturally, I didn't have a particularly good impression of that society. However, two things deeply moved me: one was charity sales for donations, and the other was raising funds by selling paper flowers. Most of the charity sales for donations were done by small shops and street vendors. This place truly demonstrated the "Cantonese spirit" of the Guangdong people. Their enthusiastic response to the donation movement in the mainland was rarely seen elsewhere. When a street vendor held a charity sale, they would specify the amount they wanted to sell to use as a donation. They would shout, put up slogans, and seem to be driven crazy. This situation often led to misunderstandings with the police, who thought they were disturbing public order and sometimes arrested them. However, whenever this happened, their companions would always come forward to help them out, and their enthusiasm for charity sales would increase even more. It was very common for a street vendor to donate hundreds of gold, or a very simple shop to donate thousands of gold, entirely to the country. Moreover, there was a fierce competition among them: if A donated five hundred gold, B would try to surpass A by specifying that they would donate one thousand gold! If A's trade association planned to donate tens of thousands of gold, B's trade association would have to surpass A's trade association by donating a larger amount. In this way, it was very common to contribute hundreds of thousands of gold in just a few days.</p>
<p>The donation movement occurred only a few times a year, which was less frequent than raising funds by selling paper flowers. Another difference was that the latter was mostly done by female students from schools. The price of each flower was only ten cents, and the funds raised were also used for charitable purposes. However, every Saturday and Sunday morning throughout the year, the sidewalks of Hong Kong were densely populated with these flower girls. No matter who you were, if you traveled along the main streets, you were sure to encounter them. They would smile at you and ask you to spend ten cents to buy a flower and pin it on your lapel. Therefore, every Saturday and Sunday morning, as long as you had been outside, you would have a flower pinned on your lapel, and once you wore this paper flower, no one would solicit you anymore. Although the flower sellers didn't force you to buy, passersby viewed it as a duty to be fulfilled. The amount of ten cents was not much for the giver, but over time, it would naturally accumulate into a considerable sum, which could be used for a significant purpose.</p>
<p>I believe that charitable organizations in various parts of the country can adopt this method, with the approval of local authorities, to raise funds for refugee relief or other charitable purposes. The "Friends of Wounded Soldiers" movement in the mainland has already been thriving for some time, but it has not yet been echoed in these coastal cities. We hope that all public organizations, charitable organizations, and churches will, in the spirit of humanity, work hard for the wounded soldiers. The above method is just a humble suggestion for reference.</p>

<h3 id="e124">Lishui, the Center of the Zhejiang Cooperative Movement <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Cang</p>
<p>Lishui is a "mountainous" county located in the upper reaches of the Ou River in eastern Zhejiang, surrounded by mountains. It is more than three hundred miles away from both Wenzhou and Jinhua (with direct bus access). Before the War of Resistance, it lay quietly, unnoticed by people.</p>
<p>After "August 13th," many government agencies, schools, organizations, and "refugees" in Zhejiang Province moved back to the rear. Lishui, because it was a "mountainous" county with many mountains, became a "blessed land" that they considered safe. As a result, they all moved here, and its population jumped from 120,000 to more than 200,000. Rents also jumped from dozens of yuan a year to dozens of yuan a month. The narrow streets were crowded with pedestrians, so congested that water could hardly flow through.</p>
<p>After the fall of Hangzhou, it became even more lively here. Almost all the important agencies of the provincial government were concentrated here. At this time, some people called Lishui "Little Hangzhou." Indeed, at this time, Lishui could be worthy of this title. It had invisibly become the political, economic, and cultural center of Zhejiang Province. Lishui had been blessed with good fortune after the war!</p>
<p>Following the relocation of various agencies and organizations to Lishui, there was also a "Zhejiang Provincial Cooperative Affairs Promotion Association." It was a cooperative organization composed of personnel engaged in cooperative affairs throughout Zhejiang, dedicated to promoting cooperative affairs throughout Zhejiang. It had nearly a thousand members. After arriving in Lishui, they decided to use this uncultivated virgin land as the center to launch the cooperative movement throughout Zhejiang. They began to carry out preliminary pioneering work.</p>
<p>At this time, although Lishui already had the name "cooperative," when you stepped into the "cooperative" and asked, there was nothing there. The so-called "cooperative" was just a sign. Even a few merchants hung up a "cooperative" sign to avoid taxes. The public had no trust or interest in "cooperatives" at all. Everyone regarded "cooperatives" as a superfluous thing. At that time, the comrades of the "Cooperative Promotion Association" first set about organizing a relatively sound and well-funded "demonstration cooperative" in order to correct the public's discriminatory psychology towards cooperatives and enhance the reputation of "cooperatives." After several months of preparation, through the relationships of various agencies and organizations, they finally raised a considerable amount of share capital, and the Lishui Urban Area Consumer Cooperative, with a brand-new appearance, emerged. The cooperative was divided into several departments: boarding, food, daily necessities, grain, etc., resembling a department store. All organizations followed the cooperative law. After a few months, because the cooperative was well managed and did not experience the "loss" or "embezzlement" and other bad phenomena that had occurred in other cooperatives in the past, its "business" was booming. Thus, it broke the public's traditional negative view of cooperatives that "cooperatives will never be run well." It had left a very good impression of "cooperatives" on the people of Lishui, sowing the seeds of the cooperative movement in Lishui.</p>
<p>Under the active promotion of the "Cooperative Promotion Association," following the "Urban Area Consumer Cooperative," "Township Cooperatives" were established in urban areas and townships, and cooperatives became very common in urban areas. However, Lishui is a "mountainous county," and its economic foundation is entirely based on rural areas. The exploitation relationship is more complex and cruel than in urban areas. Solving the rural economic problem during the War of Resistance was an urgent matter. Therefore, cooperative workers actively went deep into the countryside to open up new gardens when the cooperative movement in Lishui's urban area had made some progress. However, due to the lack of cooperative cadres, the rural cooperative movement did not achieve good results. On the contrary, there were cases of cooperatives being manipulated by private individuals or a few people. However, this was just a phenomenon that was inevitable at the beginning of the cooperative movement, and it would slowly be overcome.</p>
<p>In addition to the "Urban Area Consumer Cooperative," "Township Cooperatives," and various rural cooperatives organized under the promotion of the "Cooperative Promotion Association" in Lishui, there were also two workers' production cooperatives (weaving cooperative and leather goods cooperative) established under the guidance of the "China Industrial Cooperative Association" (affiliated to the Executive Yuan). These two production cooperatives were purely organized by mountain production workers. There was no so-called exploitation relationship at all. The workers who joined these two cooperatives worked happily and frugally every day, for themselves, for the future of the cooperative cause, and for resisting the upward development of that secretive and unreasonable cannibalistic exploitation force!</p>
<p>Due to political reasons, Lishui has become the center of the Zhejiang cooperative movement today. However, the cooperative movement in Lishui has only had a very short history from the beginning to the present. It has not yet reached its "golden age" of "full prosperity." I believe that with the active support of the Zhejiang authorities and cooperative comrades throughout the province, the cooperative movement in Lishui will surely release a bright and brilliant light in the near future! —I wish her well—</p>
<h3 id="e125">Excerpts of Condolence Couplets from All Walks of Life Mourning Mr. Cai Yuanpei <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>When the news of Mr. Cai Jiemin's death in Hong Kong arrived, the condolence couplets sent by all walks of life were dazzling and beautiful. Here are a few excerpts to give a glimpse: Zhang Fakui's couplet said: "Exemplary teacher, when the masses are in great need of education, alas, you have passed away riding a white crane"; "Hearing the sad news on the battlefield, it is a pity that the final victory is not far away, and you will not see the joyous drinking and destroying the Yellow Dragon." Yang Dezhao's couplet said: "Your articles and scholarship are admired throughout the country, tracing back thirty years of nurturing talent, recruiting all the talented people in the world"; "You enjoyed longevity and health, but could not rest in Lingnan, alas, you fell ill within one or two days, we all weep for the loss of a respected elder." Yu Hanmou said: "Your virtue and prestige are respected in the Confucian world, a towering figure, we all admire you like Han Yu"; "Your hard work benefits the Party and the country, the government and the public regret your passing, why need to posthumous titles like Wang Tong." Wu Tiecheng's couplet said: "Vast writings and profound scholarship, surpassing the ancients, in private life a great scholar, in public life a upright elder"; "Revolutionary achievements, loyal to the country, your kindness fills the world, sorrow fills the Central Plains." Wang Zhengting's couplet said: "As a senior, you are a great master, a beam and a mountain, a symbol of prestige"; "In a foreign land, we feel the loss of an elder, the plum blossoms on the distant island bring sadness to the new spring." Fang Zhenwu's couplet said: "A role model for people, Mr., you will surely have a place in the ancestral halls"; "Grieved by the national crisis, we, the survivors, will never forget the three generations of仇 [enemies]." Qian Yongming's couplet said: "Your noble integrity is as high as white clouds, for a hundred years of cultivating people, you have long had a model of preaching the way"; "Your achievements and fame are recorded in history, facing a few lines of your last writings, we cannot bear to hear the peach and plum trees weeping in the spring breeze."

<p>— Boyang</p>
<p>In addition to the taboo against the number "13" and the belief that Friday is an unlucky day, some superstitions of Westerners include avoiding walking under a ladder leaning against a wall, as it forms a triangle, reminding people of the Trinity in Christianity.</p>
<p>There are many superstitions in theaters, such as not humming tunes or singing in the dressing room, and it is unlucky to step out with the left foot first. In addition, going back to the dressing room to retrieve forgotten items and sitting on the back of a chair are all taboo.</p>
<p>Some people in the United States believe that a bride must hold an umbrella when she goes out for the first time, otherwise it is unlucky. A cradle cannot be rocked empty, otherwise the baby will not sleep peacefully.</p>
<p>The British say that cutting fingernails on Monday brings good news; cutting them on Tuesday brings new shoes; cutting them on Wednesday ensures good health; cutting them on Thursday brings wealth; cutting them on Friday brings marital bliss; cutting them on Saturday brings travel.</p>
<h3 id="e127">New Medical Technique of Using Corpses to Treat Living People <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>— Fan Sun</p>
<p>In recent years, a new treatment technique has been discovered in European and American medicine, which is to use corpses to treat patients. Although this new treatment technique is still under research and improvement, its importance in medicine is self-evident, and it will make it possible to cure several diseases that were previously hopeless.</p>
<p>When a patient needs blood, doctors often use blood transfusions to inject other people's blood into their blood vessels. This is something that everyone already knows. However, recently, a Russian professor named Xue Nuofu and Yuding (Shanov (Vudin) have discovered a way to permanently preserve blood drawn from living people or even dead people. In this way, the new-style hospitals can pre-store various types of human blood for doctors to use at any time, instead of having to temporarily draw blood from healthy people and inject it into patients during blood transfusions.</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to expert reports, they have discovered the fact that human organs continue to live for a certain period of time after a person dies. The survival time varies from a few hours to several days. American scientists have been able to use the liver and kidneys cut from corpses to replace the liver and kidneys of patients.</p>
<p>According to the results of current research, the survival time of various organs after death is: brain, ten minutes; heart muscle, twenty minutes; eye, thirty minutes; ear, one hour; arm muscle, four hours; blood components, eighteen hours; bone, three days; skin, five days. In this way, in addition to storing human blood in hospitals, various organs can also be stored. If someone suffers from a dangerous disease and a certain organ must be replaced, the doctor can go to a hospital that stores this type of organ to find a suitable replacement organ. Perhaps in the future, there will be specialized hospitals for storing blood and organs.</p>

<p>Natural scientists regard China as a new zoo, full of rare birds and animals. It is said that there are no less than one thousand four hundred and eighty-seven species of birds alone. Even fleas have seventy-five species that have already been discovered, and the rest are still being studied. This is what Mr. Sha Weibi said in his speech at the Asian Literary Association last month.</p>
<p>Some fleas have white abdomens, almost like maggots. According to Mr. Sha Weibi, every mammal has a special type of flea, although some are common to several animals. For example, the fleas on dogs are also found on cats and even on humans. The importance of fleas cannot be ignored, because many infectious diseases, such as the Black Death, are spread by them.</p>
<p>Flea specimens collected from all over China have been sent to Charles Rothschild, the world authority on flea research.</p>

<p>— Qing</p>
<p>According to a recent report by Dr. White Lai, a New York animal instructor, the way a beast or insect behaves in the world is much smarter than humans. Bees can see ultraviolet radiation, dogs can smell all odors, and snakes can suck up their prey in the air. He also proposed ten of the smartest animals: 1. Chimpanzee, 2. Gorilla, 3. Elephant, 4. Orangutan, 5. Dog, 6. Beaver, 7. Horse, 8. Sea lion, 9. Bear, 10. Cat.</p>
<p>Why this arrangement? Dr. White Lai has his own reasons. His judgment is based on the creativity, memory, imitation ability, comprehension ability, and trainability of each type of animal.</p>
<p>He said: "If chimpanzees had as much contact with humans as dogs have had for thousands of years, I dare say that this kind of animal would have made great progress in intelligence today. Therefore, I put it in the first place. As for gorillas, because their mood is more mechanical and stubborn, they are ranked second."</p>
