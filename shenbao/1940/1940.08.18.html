<p>本年夏季，日本飛機之空襲中國重慶、始於五月十八日，至今日而三閱月。重慶上空多雲霧，惟夏季爲淸朗，夏季空襲頻繁，職以是故。據日方所發表，三閱月來，日機出動者三十八次，以重慶爲目標者一一十七次、蓋於銅梁，合川，潼川，瀘州，綦江，涪州，萬縣，自流井諸地，亦嘗轟炸；每决分三五批，每批數十架不等，先後綜計凡三千三百架，即平均每决八十七架弱；共耗炸彈的二千五百噸，擲之重慶者的二千噸；希望乃在毀滅主要都市之軍事政治經濟機構，以澈底顚覆國民政府云。論其規模，日方誇稱「獲得世界戰史上空前之長距離空襲大戰果」，又謂「堪稱世界空戰史上燦然之一頁一。乃各國人士所傳播之重慶消息，輒稱國民政府堅苦奮鬥，士氣民心激昂韜厲，建設鼎盛，氣象蓬勃，開內地繁榮未有之新紀元，抗建實有光輝前途云云；謂皆身經目擊，遍刋各國之雜誌報章；然則日本所誇稱之空襲成就，是在中國亦與有「榮施」歟非歟？昨晨英國航空部公布；前晚德機往襲英國者，同時有二千五百餘架之多。昨日瑞典京城電稱；「倫敦昨日之大火與轟炸，開世界空戰之新紀元，較之西班牙內戰及中日戰事中之空戰，其相去不啻霄壤云」。相提並論，能不無窮感慨！如英德兩國者，其武備初未達於現代理想中極有其可能之最高峰，顧已爲中日武備所望塵莫及。中國志在自衛獨立，固須猛晋不懈。若日本者，希圖稱覇稱雄，以與當世諸强並駕齊驅；然而不自幡然改圖，放棄侵略，尊重鄰邦，養精蓄銳，急起直追；徒自陷於中國消耗戰略之中，彌久而不知自返；猶向中國廣漠之山野，彈丸之城鎭，作無效之消耗而猶自以爲快意；誇稱燦然，母乃黯然！夫今日遠東以日本之侵略而兩國相斫耳，他日日本而為世界戰爭中之一員，則東方木屋乃堪任何他國二千五百架飛機作一夕之轟炸火燬若今日英倫之所遭遇而猶得巍然也耶！以日本之所作爲，豈不曰空襲即所以促中國國民政府之落沒，庶幾從速結束所謂中國事變；證以德國往日之征服波蘭挪威法蘭西，皆得力於空軍，今日之進攻英國，亦置信於空襲之爲效騐；以彼例此，今後「決計向重慶繼續空襲作戰」云。此得以一般客觀條件之逈殊，反證日方主觀見解之絕謬。何以言逈殊且絕謬？德國以閃電戰術驟然作大規模之進攻，其蔽天之聲勢，高空之怒吼，密集之炸彈，籠罩之火燄，一舉而瀰望悉成焦七；於是驟然當之者，心驚胆寒，感覺不可抗而屈服；遑論日本空軍力量較德國如何遠遜，然中國軍民經三年有餘之砲火鍛鍊矣，遭空襲則稍避或不避，解警則嬉笑操作如恒；空襲愈頻繁，淡然視之愈如所謂家常便飯；總之，德國閃電戰術之得力於空軍者，在乎精神方面與物力方面同時突然發揮其「蓋罩」一切，壓倒一切之絕對優勢；日本對華，非但力有未逮，且已時機遠逝；此其一也。空軍在現代戰爭之中，居於第一綫，迄未形成作戰制勝之主力，故必以堅强而敏捷之陸上部隊相配合以赴之；西歐戰局，其明證也；如零零落落轟炸於數百里之外，雖成焦土，仍爲主力控制所不及，况二千噸之炸彈猶未能焦土重慶；此其二也。歐洲諸國亦不盡以工商業立國，然人口與廠肆咸作大規模之集中，此實作戰之重心所寄，亦對方以轟炸爭取勝利之良好對象也；其爲形態猶脊椎動物，一髮牽全體而易受致命傷；中國以農立國，兵源資源皆散在曠野，一年豐收，即可支持三四載；其爲形態猶海綿動物，傷不致命，命根無窮，故非對於一城一鎭，投以點點滴滴之炸彈所得收穫有效之威脅；此其三也。惟此三者，儘夠說明日本對於重慶所作三個月之夏季轟炸，不惟無效，聊且無聊。抑日人豈不自知之，彼無大政治家，故能發不能收，遂因循目誤於謬誤！</p>

<p>編輯先生、閱昨貴報刋布之張鴻聲君來函、建議發動一慈善籃球挑戰賽、主張集合分散於他隊之健將、混成三數强隊、向現已穩得合衆盃冠軍及上屆西靑盟主之百樂門隊挑戰、藉以解決上海籃球覇權、同時亦大有補於慈善事業、意至善也、鄙人醉心籃球、逢賽必到、對於上海籃球現狀自信有更進一步之認識、故對於張君之建議、原則當然贊同、惟對籃球圈目前現狀、實有根據事實、另作一番申述之必要、最近合衆盃展開、滬靑以中靑盟主之聲勢、更併合華聯舊部、擬挾雷霆萬鈞之　力、以與百樂門爭一日之短長、第以倉卒併合、作風未獲統一、更以棋差一着、遂又爲百樂門所擊敗、、最慘者則六戰竟三遭敗挫、第滬靑三次遭敗之因、實未可一概而論、其敗于梁溪與羣毅兩仗、戰將誠有傷踣、非戰之罪、尙有可說、惟對百樂門一仗、則滬靑曾集最整之陣容以應、張君謂為「非實力之不如」、而諉諸於天命、愚則殊未敢謂然也、</p>
<p>至於張君所倡議集合各强混成三數勁旅以招戰一節，亦尙有商討之餘地、蓋混合隊之不易組成出塲人選、當成爲最大而最嚴重之問題、雖百樂門如能擊敗此集中精銳之混合隊、自益增其海上覇權之地位、第如混合隊獲得勝利、則全滬盟主之名義、仍難有所屬祗可說「贏家」被人打破而巳、故愚意不妨仍以各球會爲單位、以原有名義向百樂鬥挑戰、球員儘量補充、塲地則不妨由挑戰者自擇、蓋每一球隊對主塲自較爲熱習、不無便利、同時百樂鬥之塲地太小、亦感不能大事開展之苦、故張君所提之中靑、自爲一最理想之塲合也、</p>
<p>茲事體大、爲慈善、爲爭覇、端賴端論界之力為促成、在百樂門與其他勁旅、平日均勇於赴義、對此盛會、諒亦樂從者也、愛集鄙見、以貢一得、讀者孫其煌謹上八月十七日、</p>
<p>（編者按）張鴻聲君倡議作慈善挑戰、以解決全滬籃球覇主一函、甫經披露、昨又獲讀者孫其煌君來函響應、並另有意見貢默、足見愛好籃球者之關切、本報旣絕對贊同於前、自樂觀厥成、惟希海上各籃球勁旅、羣起響應、庶獲順利之進展、而百樂門當局、諒亦樂於應戰者、如雙方表示同意、輿論界自當力促其成、</p>

<p>外滙昨日市况、滙豐掛牌悉無上落、英美滙暗市漫長不已、此因利空消息頻傳、如德國有再起調停中日戰事訊、人心頗受影響、買戶絕跡、自開盤以迄收盤、綏步趨鬆、未見回頭、中投機家賣出不少、港電亦吐、兼以日紗廠拋塞、華行美行俱有賣出、午收時美滙已長達五元六二五、尙不易脫手結果以最鬆價收盤、英金三辦士七八七五、美滙五元六二五、比前收英略鬆零一五六二五、美猛長一二五、期貨與現貨走勢相同、</p>

<p>烚赤跌百餘元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初以滙市硬化、且隔昨走勢本疲、開市卽撳十二元、首由銀號出證券帮二十兩、爲五千七百六十元、嗣因金號帮競賣、再跌三十元、銀號出證券帮二十兩、爲五千七百三十元、旋賴某錢兌業一再在吸、未幾復又高達五千七百五十五元、此後外滙續鬆、且有利空消息、某銀號首來拋空、加之某金號重施壓力、賣出不少、未幾卽退入五千七百元關口、一銀號出金號十爾、遜爲五千六百九十元、斯時浮空抵補、曾回升至五千七百〇八元、奈不久賣風復起、銀樓業及金號均有吐出、且某錢兌業多頭斬結、致迨收盤前已退至五千六百五十五元低價、惟收市則告五千六百六十元、結果此上日慘落一百十二元、半天一百〇五元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤較高十數元、收進减低三十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十餘元、</p>
<p>飾金再小十元</p>

<p>現棉交易仍舊平庸、廠方納胃不強、一以歐洲戰局劇烈、印美棉市難以樂觀、二則國內航綫中斷、紗銷凋敝、市價當然不能上升、以上兩大因素、使棉市阻止進展也、且廠家銀根奇緊、購進之棉、須延緩兩個月交款、所以行情無甚變化、</p>

<p>— 聖凱瓊</p>
<p>—八月十七日—</p>
<p>管理銀行辦法</p>
<p>中國政府對於銀行力面的統制，戰時並沒有一般性的統制法規·卽以一九三一年二月二十八日立法院所通過的銀行法論，對於銀行營業的管理，亦沒有採用站在某種經濟立塲上規定眞體的條文。一九三四年國民政府在七月四日所公佈施行專一性的儲蓄銀行法，雖規定銀行存款對所投放事業應佔的成份，及銀行應提實値存款總額四分之一的政府債券或其他確實的資產，交存中央銀行作爲償還儲蓄存軟的保證準備，但該法並不能適用一般銀行。戰前財部曾草擬統制性的各種銀行法規，卒未見有所建樹，戰時財部所努力的經濟作戰方法，率爲統制外滙管理貿易以及收集金銀，籌發公債·但在這抗戰三年後，已由軍事作戰轉入經濟作戰的階段，全在藉金融政策的力量，完成偉業。而如何藉金融政策使物資的轉移和社會購買力的重分配，以及建設資本的籌集和建設資金的利用，使適應抗建的需要，則全在對銀行業務加以管理，因之八月七日財政都公布一非常時期管理銀行暫行辦法「十條，是爲戰時統制銀行辦法之嚆矢。</p>
<p>管理辦法中對於銀行的主要業務如存軟·放款·滙款等，均有明確的管理辦法。在存款方面，第二條規定：「銀行經收存款，除儲蓄存款應照儲蓄銀行法辦理外，其普通存軟，應以所收存款總額百分之二十爲準備金，轉存當地中中交農四行任何一行，並由收存行給以適富存息。」在放款方法，第三條規定：一銀行運用存款，以投資生產建設事業及聯合產銷事業爲原則；其承做抵押放款，應以各該行業正當商人爲限；押款已屆滿期請求展期者，並應考査其貨物性質，如係民生日用必需品，應卽限令押款贖取出售，不得展期，以杜囤積居奇。」在滙款方面，第五條規定：一銀行承做滙往口岸滙款，應以購買日用必需及抗戰必需之款爲限。」但財政當局爲預防銀行故意規避取巧起見，對其附屬業務也加以管理，故在第四條中規定：</p>
<p>「銀行不得直接經營商業或囤積貨物，並不得以代理部。貿易部或信託部等名義，自行經營或代客買賣貨物。」</p>
<p>這一辦法的施行目的，除第一節文末所提示之外，更明確地嚴禁奸商藉銀行資金從事壟斷·居奇·投機·操縱·而求物價的平準·淺顯易見，無待深論，個人特就其他方面略加闡述。</p>
<p>（一）按之第二條的規定，任一政府銀行對於一般銀行的準備金應給以利息，則其所繳存的決非政府債券或資產，必爲法幣無疑。政府銀行收入此項資金時，無形中迭成中央銀行的地位，而增强其力量。結果對於金融的影響，可以發生兩種結果：第一種假定政府銀行牧入此項資金後，並不加以運用，則有大量的法幣流回政府銀行的銀庫而保存起來，法幣的流通額因之而收縮起來。假定是加以運用，或投資生產建設事業，或經營產銷事業，或購買公債及抵押放款，無論其爲任何途徑，勢必由政府銀行轉入民間，再由民間而流入銀行爲存款，這是一定的，則政府銀行可不必以增加負債—發行，來增加它的資產—放款，證券購置，如此法幣流通額可以不致增加，而在金融上收調節通貨的機能。（按第二條實行之後，政府銀行至少可收人十萬萬二元的法幣。）（未完）</p>

<p>星期四（十五日）各國防軍會議作成決議後、日方曾暗示、謂日海軍陸戰隊司令武田少將、行將召集第二次會議之說、昨據防軍委員會某職員稱、防軍委員會對於日軍武田司令是否將召集第二次會議一事、未有所知、但官塲方面則稱、防軍會議所作之決議、須經各關係政府批准後、始爲有效、據昨日官方正式發表、星期四（十五日）出席防軍會議之意大利代表爲加萊蒂司令、</p>
<p>美國表示　不再退讓</p>
<p>路透社十七日華盛頓電、日政府對於上海防務委員會關於英軍撤退後、接收英防區事之決議、顯有不欲遵從之意、此間人士殊以爲異、日本要求英軍防區兩處應皆移交日方接管一層、美國對之、米有退讓之象華盛頓現似待日方今後之行動、如日方果有行動、則此行動將被視為非反對為人人所當保護而亦無人保護之國際團體、但直接反對陸戰隊所代表之美國、一般感想、仍以爲日本未能於對華作戰時、再作冒險行動、尤其是在英國失敗尙未確定之時、某報謂官塲授意之口頭雷聲、雖屢作不已、然日本關於其向東南亞洲疾進之威脅、僅作一小小步驟、日本在對華戰爭中流血已多、雖欲與軕心國合作、然不能以若干人所想像的迅速而輕易之方法驟施其自己程序、日本非自由行事者、渠與蔣委員長交戰、然迄今猶覺不宜對之正式宣戰、</p>
<p>又有所謂　變通計劃</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、今（十七日）晨聞諸可靠方面、日方富局對於上海防軍司令委員會星期四日商得之決議案、或將提出變通計劃、內建議於英軍離滬後、現由英軍防守之區、卽予棄止、而重設由工部局警務處管理之兩區、如滬西界外馬路區、可由諒將於下月成立之聯合警察隊維持警務、而西虹口區則可保維通常的警務管理、關於此項防區修改說、官方不加批評、惟某方面相信、防軍司令會議商得之決議案、不久或將續有變動、日方發言人昨（十六日）在招待新聞記者席上聲稱、防軍司令並未商定星期四日之決議案、必予實施、蓋是項議案僅係防軍司令委員會續開會議時、將提出討論之計劃而已、</p>

<p>大陸報云、日海軍發言人昨日（十六日）午後招待新聞記者時聲稱、日當局對於上海防軍司令委員會星期四日會議時商獲之決定、能認爲係最後的決議、武田海軍少將提出反對、諒將獲東京政府之聲援、凡未得日當局完全允許之協定、殆不發生效力、而日方所以反對是項決議者、乃因公共租界係重慶方面政治活動之根據地、此種活動、嚴重阻撓日軍之軍事行動、</p>
<p>靜候各國　政府訓令</p>
<p>大陸報云、負責人士昨（十六日）吿記者稱、星期四日出席上海防軍委員會會議之各國防軍司令、已各將會議決議案電吿本國政府、刻正靜候訓令中、各有關政府對是項決議、將取何種行動、未能確知、惟衆信各該國政府對其駐滬陸海軍代表商妥之決議、當加贊同、</p>
<p>縱開會議　於事無濟</p>
<p>日方消息、傳上海日陸戰隊司令卽防軍司令委員會主席武田盛治海軍少將、將再度召集各委員會議、關於此說、負責方面拒不置評、一般相信防軍司令委員會苟再度會議、亦當循星期四日會議之同一路綫進行、卽英美兩軍委員·工部局警務處長·與萬國商團司令皆投票贊成業已商定之決議、而日軍或義軍委員則均投反對票、</p>
<p>何時接防　未能預言</p>
<p>負責方面對於美日軍接防新區之日期、亦未能言定、蓋英軍離滬日期、尙未規定也、惟衆信接防日期、當不出本月、記者頃以駐滬美陸戰隊擬吾增加實力一節、叩諸美軍某軍官、據答稱、渠意目下無增加實力之必要、</p>

<h3 id="c91">美國黃金問題 <a href="#c91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>美國對於黃金問題現在鬧得滿城風雨。今年最初三個月，輸入美國的黃金共値九〇〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇美元，幾等於全世界一年的產量。六月裏，英法荷比等國黃金運到紐約的，一日之中，共値二八七，〇〇〇，〇〇〇美元。到了今年年底外國黃金流入美國的，爲數至少可達二一，〇〇〇，〇〇〇）〇〇〇）美元，佔全世界金條總數百分之七十以上。黃金如依照這個比數繼續流入美國，則不出三年，全世界所有金條將完全屬於美國政府所有了。</p>
<p>這種數量的黃金向着單方面流動，實在現代經濟史上空前的突然發展。猶憶七年之前，羅斯福總統在一九三三年三月間美國發生銀行風潮聲中，開始實行新政之時，美國財政部及銀行界都憂慮，要提取十萬萬美元的黃金，美國金融也無力應付。同年夏天，世界經濟會議在倫敦開會時，多數經濟家一致承認美國經濟恐慌，黃金不足實其一大原因。到了今日，黃金過多，又被這輩經濟家認爲美國經濟繼續不振的主要原因了。</p>
<p>美國的藏金窟，係在肯德基山中，精工建造固若金湯；物質方面，較之南菲洲的金礦，允爲人跡所不易到，經濟方面，美國財政部悉心硏究，務使如許存金不致牽動美國經濟</p>
<p>黃金乃是一種籌碼，這樣的集中在一國，確很危險，這對貨幣學是門外漢的，也可以見到。不過一般人深恐全世界黃金完全屬於美國之後，其他各國會廢止通用金幣，如德國經濟部長芬克所宣佈的，那末美國以三百萬萬美元所購進的黃金，豈非將變成一錢不値，這也是皮相之談。</p>
<p>但是全世界的金條全部流入美國之後，黃金將不復成爲一種籌碼，確屬可能。惟這種情形並非卽謂美國以外各國不復需要黃金，反之，外間對於黃金的需要定必更甚，且必視爲更有儲藏的價値。又况歐洲各國對於保持黃金爲一種籌碼，其利害關係視美國爲允甚。這决戰爭一旦結束，歐洲各國從事復興，在在需款，屆時向美國舉借黃金自然最爲便利。尤其具決定的因素者厥爲各國對於美元的需求必更殷切。美國今日是無須仰給各國而各國却向之需求甚殷的唯一大國。美國貿易出超甚鉅，因之美國的匯兌亦居有利地位。歐戰愈持久，這種情形愈顯著。這種地位並非美國保有大量黃金使然。蓋外間所需要者並非美國黃金而是美元；但欲取得美元，惟有以黃金售與美國財政部。美國財政部如若繼續以美元易黃金，那末外間對於黃金的需求非特有增無减，黃金價値的漲落，且完全操諸美國財部，絕非外國所能左右。</p>
<p>眞芷的危機在那裏呢？第一，大量黃金呆着不動足以引起美國通貨膨脹，不過就美國目前情形觀之，這種危機尙屬言之過早。最迫切的危機，在於牽動國際經濟；在於美國農民失去歐洲方面僅餘的市塲；在於摧毀國際自由貿易的殘局，從而助長德義等國所推行的以貨易貨制度；在於摧毀國際資金的自由流動，從而促進獨裁各國所行匯兌統制政策。</p>
<p>所以黃金問題的危機並不在於美國喪失大量重金錢，而在於美國內國經濟及國際經濟被其牽動。</p>
<p>査國際問黃金的流動，是上决歐戰後東歐中歐不安定情形所促成的，最初是匈牙利，波蘭，德，奧，四國京城的存金運往沮利克，阿姆斯特丹，巴黎三處。後來希特勒主持德國政權，全歐騷然，倫敦便變成歐洲的保險庫，歷三年之久。一九三七年以來，全國歐洲社會政治經濟情形的變化，愈加岌岌不可終日，歐洲的黃金便開始流入美國，迄至這决歐戰爆發，黃金逃往美國，大有一瀉千里之勢。準此而論，美國黃金問題解決辦法，歐洲社會政治恢復安寗，實其先決條件。（節譯七月份Harper＇sMagazine）</p>

<h3 id="c92">世界黃金集中美國的由來 <a href="#c92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>美國政府現囤有巨額黃金，價値一九，〇〇〇，〇〇〇），〇〇〇美元有奇，其中埋藏在坎特基州諾克斯堡的不足三分之一，其餘多存在各造幣廠。這筆國金，共重五四三，〇〇〇〇，〇〇〇盎司左右，約佔全球五十餘國政府所有金條總數的三分之二，可謂已創造一種新紀錄。</p>
<p>此外，蘇聯也有若干存金，但未披露究有多少。全球各地個人所有的金幣和金條，究有若干，也無人知道。據數年前國際聯盟的估計，私人方面所藏黃金的値二，二二五，〇〇〇美元，尙有許多金質戒指，手鐲，項圈，和手表等飾物，當然無從計算。</p>
<p>各國的金條連同個人的金器，必佔人類從古以來所掘得的黃金的大部份。黃金是人類最早發現的金屬，其質地堅不毀，亘古以來，備受人類的珍視，審慎者曾將其藏諸安全處所，免爲盜賊或統治者所奪取，至今全球必仍有許多小額黃金藏匿着。</p>
<p>黃金所以長此在有組織的人類社會中成爲歷久不易的貨幣者，原因多端，其一便是黃金具有永不毀滅性，且對人類具有永不消失的深長吸引力，遂使黃金具有「囤積價値」，這種價値，今昔一貫。</p>
<p>世上存金，日積月累，已歷數千年，當今黃金每年的增加數量，實較有史以來任何時期爲巨，全球金鑛每年出產的値一，二五〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇美元之多。產量增加的原因，卽在十年以來各國政府及私人對於黃金的需求日甚一日的緣故。新准經濟學者有倡黃金「無價値」的欺人之談者。設如其言，則若輩對於黃金何以求過於供一事，顯不易解釋其所以然也。</p>
<p>美國政府現擁有黃金一九，〇〇〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇美元，在數量和價値兩方面論，其數之巨，資較歷來各國獨有的黃金數，超出遠甚，可謂有史以來，無與倫比。美國所囤黃金，實爲過去短短的六年內增加起來的。六年前美國政府所有的金條不及全世界總數百分之四十。其時世界貿易總數中，美國的佔百分之四十，故上述數量的存金並非反常。二十年以來，美國此種存金常盤旋在上述比數左右，及至此際，這項存金已達百分之六十六，且尙在增加中。</p>
<p>這種歷史上僅有的情形，必是非常的環境所促成。環境維何，經濟學家的意見，亦甚分一，在此六年間，美國貿易常居出超地位。這種出超由來已久。這筆貿易盈餘，固可存入外國銀行或投資於外國股票和企業，第因美國商人和銀行，對於許多外國政府在金融上所負的責任，有所懷疑，故多不願聽其留諸海外，而較爲安全的辦法，唯有將這筆盈餘易成黃金。</p>
<p>或有以這筆盈餘何勿購買其他貨物爲問者。要知所謂盈餘者，祇是美國輸出在價値上超出輸入之數而已。這便是說，美國在此期間，業已吸收了外國各種貨物，美國進口商若輸入更多的外國貨，大的已無法銷售，縱能售出，也無利可圖了。</p>
<p>然則，旣不能用放款或易成他種財富來處置盈餘，何以唯有易成黃金的方法呢？答曰，這因爲黃金是目下國際通行的唯一籌碼。凡所謂「通貨」者原係在各國人民間自由通行，一出國界，他人很少加以接受的，或竟加拒絕。反之，各國對於黃金，無不立刻接受，其數量且無限止。這種情形，由來已久，罕見例外。舉世商人，銀行，或政府，未有拒不接受黃金以交換貨物的。持有黃金便能在世界各處立刻換取種種物件，因之，經濟學家稱黃金爲「最流動的財富」。</p>
<p>黃金流入美國的第一種主因，與上述原因大同小異。六年以來，存款於美國銀行最稱安全。他國銀行，商號，富豪，甚至他國政府，寗願存款於美國銀行，而不存入本國銀行。更有他國人民對銀行存款的購買力，發生疑懼，致易成黃金運往美國寄存，益見其多。</p>
<p>六年以來，美國存金總額從百分之四十激增至百分之六十六的原因，旣如上述，特這批黃金悉歸美政府獨有，原因何在？這種原因與前述兩種原因截然不同。原來美國國會曾在一九三二年通過法律，規定除金質飾物與器皿外，私人不得收藏黃金。美政府曾下令，美國境內，唯聯邦政府可收藏黃金，各個人，銀行，和各路各市財政局，一概不得收藏黃金。供工商業用者除外，但須受嚴格統制。這道法令便是異常環境促成美政府囤積巨額黃金的主因。</p>
<p>這種法律，可稱之爲黃金國有法，是美國史上關於黃金的另一特殊現象。美國在獨立前殖民地時代，或在成立聯邦之後，個人和銀行收藏國家的合法貨幣，卽黃金，絕不違法。美國憲法起草人地下有知，亦當視這種法令爲瘋在，當時有人建議授權聯邦政府發行紙幣者，亦曾遭吾決。蓋當時人人所信賴的，威唯硬幣而已。</p>
<p>美國內戰時，局勢杌隉已極。林肯總統及國會的主要困難，除軍事外，便是應付黃金問題，但未曾夢想到禁止私人收藏黃金。上决世界大戰時，威雨遜總統及國會亦從無禁止人民收藏黃金之意。除戰爭時代而外，美國有史以來，經濟蕭條者，不下三十四次，銀行發生風潮者不可計數，小銀行倒閉者數以百計。但在歷决經濟與銀行危急期間，私人或銀行收藏黃金者，從無一次被認爲違法，故美國現行黃金國有法，在美國史上，尙屬創舉，推原其故，乃是一九三三年美國銀行業發生大風潮所致。</p>
<p>現行黃金國有法並米規定金元確實成份，卽其價値亦須由總統臨時規定。九三四年一月三十一日，羅斯福總統宣布暫定金元成份爲純金一盎司的三十五分之一。此種成份，總統仍有隨時改變之權。</p>
<p>美國聯邦準備銀行所發行的紙幣約五，〇〇〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇美元，若把這些紙幣換取金元，美財部須發出純金約一四三，〇〇〇，〇〇〇盎司。至以美國各種貨幣和輔幣而論，爲數共的七，五〇〇〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇美元，若以之兌換現金，共約二四，〇〇〇，〇〇〇盎司。假如要求兌換現金的是他國人民，美財剖査問屬實後，卽須撥付現金。但美國人民則因黃金國有法的限制，絕不能換取黃金。</p>
<p>一九三三年及一九三四年，美政府將黃金收歸國有時，並未予以沒收，而曾發給「黃金證書」，保證日後予以發還。當時黃金大多在美國上二家聯邦準備銀行中，餘者分存其他銀行。民間交出黃金之數，照每盎司二十元六角七分計算，約値四，〇〇〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇美元。總統並宣布金元成份較前减輕百分之四十，則財部所收到的黃金，共値六，八〇〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇美元，兩數相較，所差二，八〇〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇美元，稱之爲政府的「盈餘一，其大部份已撥入外匯穩定基金了。</p>

<h3 id="c93">美國的空軍 <a href="#c93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>世界各國的空軍獨立而不附屬於陸海兩軍者，除英國外，唯義國而已。義國編成獨立的空軍，原效法英國，其制服的顏色和一般編制亦幾與英國空軍完全相同，祗是級位的微章有異而已。</p>
<p>此外，英國海軍附有航空隊，這一點義國並未仿傚。義國海軍絕未建造航空母艦。該國的空軍必須協助海陸兩軍作戰，必要時目須單獨作戰。原來義國空軍的編制，以在地中海方面作戰爲目標。其主張是：陸上根據地的飛機作戰，必較艦上的飛機允爲得力。</p>
<p>義國航空部長是墨索里尼兼任的。該國飛機設計頗爲精巧，時有新發明，然優劣不一。共製造是不逮英德遠甚，因之義國最優秀飛機隊，較之其餘機隊的配備，優劣眞有天壤之別。義國第一綫的飛機爲數殊夥，其式樣則多已陳舊。義國當局雖力圖改編飛機隊，補充新式飛機，然尙無多大成就。估計義國目下空軍擴充及改編計劃，須歷時三載始能完成</p>

<p>去秋探病至琴川，忽驚萱草萎堂前；四年空戢鴛鴦翼，一夕平分子母錢。華鄂不榮兄弟鮮，戚里相看更勿善；明璫翠袖任分携，此身轉輾縛如繭。訟之公庭痴復聾，杜鵑枉自泣東風；身外從此無長物，飄泊於今類斷蓬。却辭琴川來歇涌，重尋京兆描眉嫵；詎料馮郞負小靑，遂令紅拂辭揚素。孑然一身何所依，枇杷猶憶故園扉；安排弦索新翻曲，拂拭羅紈舊舞衣。芳名素日薰蘭芷，依然車馬門如市；倚席遙看舊燕飛，空梁落盡春泥紫。我昨聞卿琵琶聲，知卿心事未分明；仙槎載得春如海，訴向東皇別有情。此情却與潯陽類，司馬靑衫重掩淚；爲卿續賦琵琶行，讀罷定知心欲碎。</p>
<p>詩二首</p>
<p>自理輕竿學釣徒，聊將山水作工夫；客來相見胡盧問，可有鱸魚一尺無？（垂釣）壯歲光陰去似梭，學書學劍兩蹉跎；從前俯仰空陳跡，此後飄零可奈何！千古河山增感慨，卅年心力付消磨，孤懷無限憑誰訴，聊寄悲辛與嘯歌。（感懷）</p>

<h3 id="c95">雷與電 <a href="#c95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>— 金箴</p>
<p>炎夏的氣候，時時要發生變幻，上半天是一片蔚藍的天色，偶而有一二朶白雲點綴點綴，火一般的太陽燻得地面上在發燒，到得下半天，白雲漸漸地消失，却換來了一層層的烏雲，在空中一片片的鑲嵌起來，把那陽光遮蔽得不能透出一絲光芒，那一片長空全是烏雲的蹤跡了。在傍晚的時光，間或有一聲聲微弱的雷鳴打從西天邊傳遞過來，而天色隨着黑一陣暗一些了，烏雲更浩浩蕩蕩的從東方汹湧着，被那陣風夾帶着，在不知不覺中偷襲前進，而雷聲又慢慢地響起來。</p>
<p>忽的電光一閃，這一閃眞是出乎人意料之外，在一霎時間把那間黑暗的房屋照得雪亮，很淸楚認識：那是阿慧的家裏。接着聲震耳的霹靂，似乎當着阿慧的頭頂上劈下，這一下把他嚇得躲在母親的懷裏，而阿明却很安閒地坐着，好像是沒有這回事似的。</p>
<p>「不要嚇，你平時不做錯事，不用怕！那是打死那些黑良心的壞人的。」他母親柔聲和氣的安慰着他。</p>
<p>他躱了好一會兒，到得雷聲漸漸地和緩下來，電光也不十分雪亮，這才敢站起身子來。他却聽得他哥哥在笑他的胆怯無用。</p>
<p>「哥哥，你爲什麼不怕雷響？」「雷響眞是很平凡的現象，這完全是烏雲帶了電的緣故，而天空中的空氣是絕緣的，就是電不能從空氣中通過，而當烏雲中的電要通過空氣的當兒，便和空氣發生衝突，兩相撞擊，便發出火花，更有聲音的產生，那火花的光，我們一向叫它爲電」，而那聲音叫做「雷」。我們在地上是先看見電光，後來便聽得雷響，其實這雷和電是一同發生的，那麽我們爲什麼會有前後的呢？原來它們倆是在舉行賽跑，電的速度比雷來得快，所以電光先到地上。當雷發生的一霎那，不過只有轟的一聲，然而我們聽起來，却是轟，轟，轟……的饗個不停，因爲那雷聲是由於火花的熱把空氣急激膨脹而所發生，聲音如果遇到了別的雲，或是其他的高山深谷，就有回聲，所以這急響了一聲，那邊便回答一聲，這樣雷聲是很延長而繼續不息的響着。有時烏雲和地面中間，也飛着火花，要是有人和其他的房屋在那裏，於是人便觸電而死，房屋便要燒起來，這的確是很可怕的，凡是被雷打死的人，全身都是黑色，我們都誣他一定是個壞人，要是他是個好人，豈不是寃枉的嗎？如果雷打一定是打死壞人，那麼世界上一定沒有一個人敢做壞人了，所以這句母親剛才說過的話是不科學化，不過我們也不應該做壞人，因此這句不科學化的話，在科學落後的我國，也曾發生過不少相當的效力。」</p>
<h3 id="c96">學習作文的小經騐 <a href="#c96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>— 俞俞</p>
<p>（一）學接字我在私塾裏議了多年，開始學習作文，是接字，先生出一個字，敎我接一個字放在上面或下面都可以。我還記得，第一次接字，先生出一個天字，我便把一個上字接在天字下面，成爲天上兩字，寫在豆腐乾大小的白紙上，先生以爲對的，圈上兩圈。我以爲作文不過這麼一回事，倒也容易。有一次，先生出一個閏字，我想了好久，想不出可以接的字，忽然想起小書千字文上不是有閏餘成歲一句麽？便寫閏餘兩字，交給先生，先生問我什麼解說，我只得據實直說是抄千字文的。幸虧先生沒有責備，還對我講明白「閏餘兩字的解說，我自然萬分感激。這種接字的方法，我想小朋友們不曾學過，作文先學接字，免得隨便硬搭，不能說他毫無意思吧！</p>
<p>（二）學造句接字學得差不多了，先生敎我學造句，先生出一個字，我至少加上兩個字，造成一句，現在想來，兩個字也可以成句，如我笑」「狗叫」，不過那時的先生，敎我造句，至少要用三個字，句子越造越長，越造越複雜，學到後來，居然能够兩三句聯在一起了。作文原是積句而成篇，會造句子，就容易聯綴起來，成功一篇。可惜中國文字的句法，究有幾種，到現在還沒有弄淸楚，我所學的造句，當然是句法中的一部分，可是已受用不淺呢！小朋友們，造句方法，也許沒有學過，我在少年時代，却化過幾個月的功夫呢。你們如果覺得句子造得不好，我以爲也應該特別學習學習才是啊！</p>
<p>（三）學問答造句學得差不多了，先生敎我學問答，就我所讀的書中，不問歷史地理等等，出幾個問題，敎我作答，書當然不許看的。有一次，我鬧了一個天大的笑話，先生從歷史書中出個問題，「征服部落者何人？」我相信小朋友們，都很容易回答出來，我的答案眞奇妙呢，「答曰征服部落者落之黃帝是也，」小朋友們看了我的答案，也許一嚇，那裏來的落之黃帝！我的先生也覺得丈二和尙，摸不着頭腦，問我落之黃帝楚什麽意思？我當時心中非常得意，以爲我做的答案連先生都不明白呢，很高興的把歷史書打開，指着一張人像圖下面的文字，說道「征服部落之黃帝。人的名字，至多兩個字，這個黃帝，當然叫落之黃帝了。先生一聽，知道我解說不出圖下的文字，胡亂斷章取義，便笑着對我講解，我才恍然大悟，一時面紅耳赤，連頭都抬不起來。可見做問答，必先懂得書中的意義，亂做是不行的</p>
<p>（四）學虛字問答學得差不多了，先生敎我學虛字的用法。文字的通不通，完全是虛字的關係，虛字用得當，文字不患不通。所謂虛字，在文言文中如之乎者也豈雖然然而然則等等，在語體文中如的了嗎呢等等，先生最先敎我的虛字是「豈不……哉」，「非……耶」，「不亦……乎，」虛字用在一句的兩端，比較容易些。其次敎我的虛字是「旣非……又不……」四個虛字用在幾句中，那就難得多了。又其次敎我用「雖……然……則……也，」那簡直要做成一小段文字了。當然虛字的使用法，還多着呢，我還記得，每天做一段，前後學了兩個多月，才算吿一段落。小朋友們，語體文未嘗沒有虛字，如何使用虛字，實在値得注意的。其實從接字，到造句，從造句到做問答，從做問答到虛字使用，都是學習作文的基本工作，方法不論新舊，只要有功效，現在大家以爲這是老古董，不値得注意我以爲是不對的。當然，如何變通，如何改良，是應該的。</p>
<p>（五）命題作文虛字使用法，學得差不多了，先生出題目，敎我做文章，起初做些淺近的題目，倒也搖筆卽來，，進步很快，後來題目越出越深，先生的批改，越來越嚴，成績自然不會高明了。我還記得，有一次先生出一個題目，是左傳上的「師克在和」四個字，我看了題目，不覺一呆，兵打勝仗，在乎彼此和氣，題目上已經說完，叫我做什麼文章，左思右想，勉强湊成二百字，先生一看，大大生氣，用墨筆在開頭一勾，在文末一勾，全篇一齊勾銷，另外替我擬作一篇，當然不免受一頓申斥，那時的我，也有些不服氣，我的文章雖壞，難道一個字都用不得，先生文章雖好，難道一些沒有不對的嗎？可是先生是尊嚴的，我那裏敢發作？後來難的題目，也被我做像了，有時居然全篇濃圈密點，先生得意，連我也得意，一題到手寫寫一二千字，好像句子是現成的，意思是無窮的。於是喜歡向報紙投稿，那時報紙的論說，不止一篇，我的文字，時被選登，有一次往民權報去領稿費，主筆周浩先生，特地邀我談話，一看我是靑年學生，說了許多勉勵的話，臨別，送我「鍊才就範」四個字，以後我的文字，從奔放，歸入簡練，可是我眞慚愧，直到如今，文章還是做得不好，連自己都覺得不滿意，俗語說，初學三年，天下去得，再學三年，寸步難行，這幾句話，眞是不錯啊！</p>

<p>— 唯我</p>
<p>現在北方黎園的情形，與從前不同，坤角照樣組班挑大樑，而且號召力相當不錯。拏眼前來講吧，現在北方出演的，計有王玉蓉，趙嘯瀾，吳素秋，梁韻秋，董慧買，黃玉華等人，在這許多「頭牌坤角」中</p>
<p>王玉蓉</p>
<p>本來是最紅的一人，最有叫座力量，然而自從她去年來滬輟演北歸以後，不知何故，賣座成績竟然大减，以致玉蓉不好意思冉在北平出演，乃有南返之意。上月初玉蓉貼「臨別紀念」演「雁門關」兩晚，報上登出「卽日南返北米無期」之字樣，竟然連賣兩晚滿堂，因爲營業之大有轉機，玉蓉又將南返之意打消，現在照常在平出演。</p>
<p>吳素秋</p>
<p>在平原不甚紅，自從到上海更新舞臺來唱了一回，返平之後，大受觀衆歡迎，尤其是牠那齣「紡棉花」，逢貼必滿，紅遍九城。據說吳素秋和嘯瀾都有一部份做「特殊賣座」的商人，包銷紅票，所以他倆賣座的成績，能駕乎一切人之上。又素秋不日又將甫來，應更新之邀，接譚富英之後隊。</p>
<p>黃玉華</p>
<p>這一個子很陌生，此人和王玉華的名字相同，有人以爲是新艷秋，其實另有其人，她是一個初出茅廬的黃毛丫頭，只有十六七歲，因爲有銀行界中人硬捧，於是也掛起頭牌來，「藝術」兩個字談不到，但因捧塲有人，賣座並不落後。梁韻秋董慧賣一人，藝旣平平，捧者亦妙，故出演之成績，尙不及黃玉華也。</p>
<p>侯玉蘭</p>
<p>自與奚嘯伯拆夥後，早有自挑大　之說，但遲運至今，猶未實現，玉蘭現與楊寶森及坤伶鬆生宗英為配，李宗英為由滬去平之坤伶鬆生之一，近在平不常出演，張文娟北來後，出演數次，極博好評，乃帥張榮奎亦大交老運，數度演唱合作戲，頗爲九城人仕所激賞。</p>
<p>秋雲艷</p>
<p>亦係由滬去平者，來平後拜老伶工王瑤卿爲師，拜師贄敬千元，開瑤卿收徒之紀錄。秋雲艷現已易名張雲燕，學戲甚勤，尙無組班出演之訊，推捧張者已大有人在，將來出演，銷紅票可無問題，預料成績必佳，不致坍南方人的臺也。</p>

<p>第五章　惡消息</p>
<p>裏面靜了一靜，我又偷偷把一隻眼睛露出門邊，余甘棠正在卸他的短褂，背向着門，他又說話了。</p>
<p>「兆麒，你還不曉得我所受的刺激。我決不能就這樣干休」。</p>
<p>「我懂得啦。不過這件事究竟沒有意思，而且也太危險——」</p>
<p>「危險？我什麽都不怕，我一定要這樣幹」！</p>
<p>「好，好，那末你現在先應當到我樓上去躺一躺。你說你昨夜沒有好睡啊」。</p>
<p>我忽聽得地板上頓足的聲音。「我非打死他不可」！「喂，輕聲些——怎麽。大門也開着」！</p>
<p>我覺得我的地位危險了，事實上不能不走。我忙把身子離開門口，放開脚步，向弄口走去。我還走不到三步，聽得背後開門的聲音，我才坦坦地走出弄口，在人行道邊站了一站，計劃我進行的步驟。我可要找一個警察立卽把余甘棠拘住？這似乎用不着着急。他旣有了着落之所，又絕不防人家懷疑他—剛才我覺得他在電梯上向我注視，完全是我自己情虛眼前決不會逃走，以後如何處置，儘可讓霍桑來作主。這時我最關切的，還在霍桑身上。他究竟到那裏去了？先回去了嗎？在情勢上也決不致如此。可是他也另有意外的機遇，碰見了趙伯雄，故而跟着他去嗎？我經過了一分鐘的攷慮，定意先回愛文路寓所裏去一趟。霍桑就是不曾回去，也許有信息留在寓裏。（七九）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Japan Demands Thailand Establish Naval and Air Bases; Thailand Considering Sending Representatives to Japan for Discussion; Vietnam's Position Sufficient to Influence Thailand's Attitude <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing: Today, Chinese newspapers widely report on Japan's various demands upon Thailand. According to Hong Kong sources, Japan has demanded that Thailand allow it to establish naval and air bases in the country, permit it to use Thai railways, and conclude a mutual assistance treaty. Reports also indicate Thailand is considering sending representatives to Japan to discuss these demands. (United Press, 17th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: This morning, the Central Daily News published an exclusive article by General Xu Peigen, warning the United States, Britain, Germany and Italy about Japan's intentions regarding Vietnam. Xu first stated the military importance of Vietnam, saying it can control China's route to the South China Sea in the north, serve as a strong base for attacking the Philippines in the east, control the South China Sea and the Malay Peninsula in the southeast and south, and encircle Siam in the west. Britain owns the Malay Peninsula and Singapore, holding the key to east-west traffic between the Pacific and Indian Oceans. However, the Malay Peninsula has vulnerabilities: (1) the peninsula is easily surrounded by sea; (2) due to a lack of resources, it cannot be defended indefinitely. Britain must maintain close relations with Siam to strengthen Singapore's defenses, but Vietnam's position can influence Siam's attitude, as the country is a plain without defensible terrain. Vietnam's highlands control it on the east, south, and north sides. In the past, China could rule Siam because Vietnam was a Chinese dependency. Japan's goal to completely dominate the Pacific is to conquer China and then control the South China Sea. To achieve this, Japan must weaken British and American power in Singapore and the Philippines. Therefore, Japan's occupation of Vietnam is a preliminary step to deal with the United States and Britain. Although Japan feels a lack of troops in the war against China, using a large army to occupy Hainan Island implies Japan's intentions toward Vietnam. Japan's propaganda about joining the Axis is not that Japan is willing to disperse its forces to help Germany and Italy fight; its true meaning is to take advantage of the situation in Europe to seize their colonies in the Far East. Currently, the Konoe Cabinet is advocating a new diplomatic policy, arresting British nationals in Japan, and concentrating the navy in Qinzhou Bay and Hainan. Japan intends to give Germany and Italy the impression that Japan is preparing to attack Singapore. Japan is currently demanding the use of Haiphong and Saigon, roughly as naval, land, and air force bases for its future military actions. Japan is doing this in the hope of seizing Vietnam without war, and also to gain the favor of Germany and Italy. But will Japan truly help Germany and Italy? In fact, Japan is currently waiting and watching. If Germany defeats Britain, Japan will take the opportunity to attack Singapore. If Germany fails, Japan will be satisfied with occupying Vietnam, waiting for an opportunity to expand to the South China Sea in the future. In other words, as a result of three years of war against China, Japan feels its resources are exhausted and has to threaten the United States and Britain with bluster. As for its relationship with Germany and Italy, Japan's goal is to obtain Vietnam without giving the Axis powers real help. The United States, Britain, Germany, and Italy should all recognize Japan's true situation. It is noted that Xu was the leader of the Chinese Air Force and a spokesperson for the Chinese military and is currently the chief of staff of Minister of Military Affairs He Yingqin.

<p>Luoyang: The Women's Representative Conference of this province held its opening ceremony on the morning of the 16th. The first meeting was held in the afternoon, attended by over 100 representatives from all walks of life and women representatives from across the province. The draft constitution of the provincial women's association, a declaration of the conference, and 18 proposals were passed on the spot. It was also decided to send telegrams of respect to President Chiang Kai-shek, Madame Chiang, and the Commander-in-Chief in the name of the conference, and to send telegrams of condolence to the soldiers at the front. The conference will close today. (17th dispatch)</p>

<p>Chongqing: Several Japanese planes, seemingly taking off from Hankou today, again raided western China. Zigong, a famous salt production center in western China that supplies salt to residents in the four provinces of the west, was bombed again. A total of three groups of Japanese planes participated in the bombing of Zigong. In addition to Zigong, Fushun and Yongchuan counties were also raided. Both counties are smaller cities in Sichuan Province located near highways. Due to a lack of modern water pipes and fire engines, the losses were enormous. Chongqing was not attacked today, but residents stayed in air raid shelters for five hours. According to a senior officer of the Chinese Air Force defending Chongqing, the recent change is that Japanese planes now fly higher than before to avoid anti-aircraft guns. A month ago, they flew at an altitude of 5,000 meters, but now they often fly at 6,500 to 7,500 meters. (United Press, 17th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Around 10:00 AM this morning, an air raid alarm was issued here again. Soon, two groups of Japanese planes flew from Hankou into Sichuan, flying west along the south bank of the Yangtze River to Luzhou, Zigong, and Jiading, circling for a long time, but no bombing was heard. When the planes flew near Nanchuan, the third group of Japanese planes also flew from Hankou and bombed there, continuing to fly west to Luzhou and other places. It was reported that the area near Zigong was also bombed. The alarm was lifted at 3:00 PM. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Today, several groups of Japanese planes raided cities in Sichuan Province. Residents here took shelter in air raid shelters for up to five hours, but the Japanese planes did not fly into Chongqing. The first alarm was issued here at 10:30 AM after receiving reports of Japanese planes flying into Sichuan Province. At 11:15 AM, Japanese planes were discovered downstream of Chongqing, so an emergency alarm was issued. However, the Japanese planes flew west over Chongqing and bombed Luzhou again. After the Japanese planes flew back to their base over Chongqing, another group of Japanese planes was discovered flying upstream, but they also did not reach Chongqing, mainly bombing a certain place downstream of here. The alarm was lifted at 3:00 PM. (Reuters, 17th)</p>

<p>Beiping: The "Anti-British Committee" previously organized here is now carrying out large-scale activities, issuing declarations and persuading Chinese landlords to evict British tenants. It is unknown whether anyone has complied. (Haitong, 17th)</p>
<p>Beiping: The Chinese newspapers here, acting on the instructions of the Japanese army in North China, have recently advocated the rejection of all European and American influence in China, not just targeting Britain. However, since the withdrawal of British troops from North China, anti-British activities have flourished again. A certain newspaper actually stated that "anti-British" and "overthrowing Chiang" are closely related. According to Chinese newspapers, the Beiping Anti-British Association has sent letters to landlords who rent houses to British people, urging them to terminate their leases with the British as soon as possible.

<p>Hong Kong: According to Hong Kong newspapers, those in charge say that the dispute over the Pearl River has been resolved. The Taikoo ship "Foshan" and a Japanese ship will both sail from Guangzhou to Hong Kong on Sunday. Upon investigation, the British ship "Foshan," which travels between Hong Kong and Guangzhou, was detained by the Japanese in Guangzhou since the beginning of August, thus on August 8th, its request to sail into Hong Kong was denied. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>Hong Kong: The Osaka Shosen Kaisha office here announced today that the British ship "Foshan" has been released by the Japanese authorities and can arrive in Hong Kong on August 19. The company said that the Japanese merchant ship "Hakuyokomaru," which was detained by the British authorities on August 8, has also been released. This indicates that the recent dispute between the British and Japanese authorities over the river port dues in Guangzhou has been resolved. The "Foshan" was detained due to the issue of the agreement between Britain and Japan regarding the supply and treatment of Japanese navy pilots. The "Foshan" is a ship of the Taikoo Steamship Company and was detained in Guangzhou when British-Japanese negotiations to open the Pearl River stalled. The Japanese authorities insisted that the stevedores at the Guangzhou docks should belong to "approved groups." The British believed that this would give the Japanese an unfair monopoly and could cause strikes against British shipping companies. (United Press, 17th)</p>

<h3 id="e12">Japan's Summer Bombing and Germany's Blitzkrieg <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>This year's summer, the aerial bombardment of Chongqing, China, by Japanese aircraft began on May 18, and has lasted for three months today. Chongqing's skies are often cloudy, but summer is clear, hence the frequent summer air raids. According to the Japanese side, in the past three months, Japanese aircraft have sortied 38 times, with Chongqing as the target in 117 of those. Places such as Tongliang, Hechuan, Tongchuan, Luzhou, Qijiang, Fuzhou, Wanxian, and Zigong have also been bombed. Each sortie is divided into three to five batches, each batch consisting of dozens of aircraft, totaling 3,300 aircraft. On average, each sortie involves slightly less than 87 aircraft. A total of 2,500 tons of bombs have been used, with 2,000 tons dropped on Chongqing, hoping to destroy the military, political, and economic institutions of the main city to completely subvert the National Government. In terms of scale, the Japanese side boasts of "achieving unprecedented long-range air raid results in world war history," and "can be called a brilliant page in world aerial warfare history." However, news of Chongqing disseminated by people from various countries often states that the National Government is fighting hard, that morale and public sentiment are high, that construction is booming, that the atmosphere is vigorous, and that a new era of prosperity has been opened in the interior, and that the war of resistance and construction has a bright future, etc. They say that they have personally witnessed this and that it is widely published in magazines and newspapers in various countries. Then, is the bombing success boasted by Japan a "glorious benefit" to China, or is it not? Yesterday morning, the British Air Ministry announced that more than 2,500 German aircraft attacked Britain last night. Yesterday, a dispatch from the capital of Sweden stated that "the great fire and bombing in London yesterday opened a new era in world aerial warfare, incomparably superior to the aerial warfare in the Spanish Civil War and the Sino-Japanese War." To compare the two is to have infinite feelings. Countries like Britain and Germany have military equipment that has not yet reached the highest possible peak in modern ideals, but it has already surpassed what China and Japan can hope for. China aims to defend its independence, so it must strive forward without懈怠. As for Japan, it hopes to dominate and be on par with the world powers. However, without repenting and changing its course, abandoning aggression, respecting neighboring countries, conserving strength, and catching up quickly, it is only trapping itself in China's war of attrition, the longer it goes on, the less likely it is to return. It is still making ineffective attrition in China's vast mountains, fields, and small cities and towns, yet it still thinks it is enjoyable and boasts of brilliance. Alas, today, the Far East is fighting each other because of Japan's aggression. If Japan becomes a member of the world war in the future, can an eastern wooden house withstand a night's bombing and burning by 2,500 aircraft from any other country like what Britain is experiencing today and still stand tall? With what Japan is doing, wouldn't it be said that the bombing is to promote the decline of the Chinese National Government, so as to quickly end the so-called China Incident? Based on Germany's past conquests of Poland, Norway, and France, all of which benefited from the air force, and today's attack on Britain, which also places faith in the effectiveness of bombing, from their examples, it will "decide to continue bombing Chongqing." This can be used to reverse prove the utter fallacy of the Japanese side's subjective views based on the vast differences in general objective conditions. Why is it said that it is vastly different and utterly fallacious? Germany uses lightning warfare tactics to suddenly launch large-scale attacks. The overwhelming momentum, the roar in the sky, the dense bombs, and the enveloping flames turn everything into scorched earth in one fell swoop. As a result, those who suddenly face it are frightened and feel irresistible and surrender. Not to mention how far Japan's air force is inferior to Germany's, Chinese soldiers and civilians have been tempered by artillery fire for more than three years. When they encounter air raids, they either take shelter or do not, and when the alert is lifted, they laugh and operate as usual. The more frequent the air raids, the more indifferent they are, and they regard it as so-called home cooking. In short, the success of Germany's lightning warfare tactics with the air force lies in the simultaneous and sudden exertion of its absolute advantage in "covering" and overwhelming everything in terms of spirit and material strength. Japan has not only failed to reach this level against China, but the timing has long passed. This is one reason. The air force is in the front line in modern warfare and has not yet formed the main force for winning battles, so it must be combined with a strong and agile land force. The situation in Western Europe is clear proof of this. If you sporadically bomb hundreds of miles away, even if it becomes scorched earth, it is still beyond the control of the main force, not to mention that 2,000 tons of bombs have not yet been able to scorch Chongqing. This is the second reason. European countries are not all based on industry and commerce, but the population and factories are concentrated on a large scale. This is where the focus of the battle lies, and it is also a good target for the opponent to win victory by bombing. Its form is like a vertebrate, where moving one hair affects the whole body and is easily fatally wounded. China is based on agriculture, and its soldiers and resources are scattered in the wilderness. One year of good harvest can support three or four years. Its form is like a sponge, where injuries are not fatal, and the lifeblood is infinite. Therefore, it is not possible to achieve an effective threat to a city or town by dropping bombs bit by bit. This is the third reason. These three reasons are enough to explain that Japan's three-month summer bombing of Chongqing is not only ineffective but also boring. Do the Japanese not know this themselves? They have no great politicians, so they can launch but not收, thus they follow the erroneous path and ignore the truth!</p>

<p>Athens: Two Greek destroyers were bombed yesterday while sailing to the island of Tinos. It is said that the aircraft belonged to Italy. (United Press, 17th)</p>
<p>Greece: Startling rumors are currently circulating outside the capital, saying that the Greek merchant ships "Attiki," "Friton," and "Elsa" were attacked by aircraft of unknown nationality in the Aegean Sea. It is also reported that two Greek destroyers were bombed by aircraft of unknown nationality while returning from Tinos to Piraeus. It is also reported that the Greek destroyer "Kountouriotis" was attacked by a submarine of unknown nationality. Those in charge here denied last night that all the rumors were false and obviously intended to exacerbate recent events in Greece. (Haitong News Agency, 17th)</p>
<p>Rome: The Italian Stefani News Agency said that Italian submarines have not reported bombing Greek warships, nor have they been cruising in the area where the Greek warship "Helle" was torpedoed during this period. Responsible parties stated that it can be seen from the remarks in the British and American newspapers that those who are trying to stir up trouble in the Balkans are now plotting. It is noted that after the Greek light cruiser "Helle" of 2,115 tons was torpedoed by a submarine of unknown nationality in the Aegean Sea two days ago, British officials immediately stated that there were no British submarines in the area, but Italian submarines were known to be active there. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>Athens: Greek newspapers have expressed great indignation at the sinking of the light cruiser "Helle" and condemned the attack as an unprecedented crime. (Reuters, 17th) Rome: The Italian government solemnly denied yesterday the British claim that the Greek cruiser "Helle" was sunk by an Italian submarine. This news issued by the British side has also been published in some American newspapers. The Italian government said that it is completely fabricated, and its purpose is nothing more than to undermine the peace of the Balkans. This is a new conspiracy by the British Churchill faction to wage war. (Haitong News Agency, 17th)</p>
<p>Rome: When the press corps was received here yesterday, a certain speaker said that the relationship between Italy and Greece has not changed. The sinking of the Greek cruiser "Helle" does not affect the diplomatic relations between the two countries, because Italy has nothing to do with the incident. British radio stations and newspapers immediately blamed Italy for the incident. Before the British Naval Department even received a report, the speaker insisted that there were no Italian submarines near the island of Tinos. This move by the British side is nothing more than to spread a terrible atmosphere in the Balkans and spread the war. Well-informed sources here believe that Italy's policy towards Greece will not be affected by the incident. Yesterday, the newspapers did not criticize the incident. (Haitong News Agency, 17th)</p>
<p>Rome: Italian newspapers yesterday began publishing news about the sinking of the Greek cruiser "Helle" on the first page and wrote articles commenting on it. "Italian News" said that the British propaganda, claiming that the "Helle" was sunk by an Italian submarine, is obviously intended to blame Italy for the recent events in Italy and Greece. The newspaper then urged Greece to remember the "Athenia" incident and not fall into the British trap. (Haitong News Agency, 17th)</p>
<p>Geneva: After the Italian government recently proposed to Greece to improve relations between the two countries, the "Tribune" here recently published a dispatch from Berlin, claiming that the Italian demands on Greece are nothing more than three points: (1) demand that the Greek government abolish the guarantee previously provided by Britain, that is, the guarantee that it is willing to maintain Greece's territorial integrity; (2) demand that the border between Greece and Albania be re-surveyed; (3) demand that the border between Greece and Bulgaria be revised so that Bulgaria has access to the Aegean Sea.

It was submitted to the Supreme National Defense Council for review and implementation. After careful deliberation by the council, the following three principles were decided: (1) Each agency involved in personnel management should have personnel specifically responsible. As for whether to add a dedicated unit for management, organize a committee to handle it, or simply designate a special officer to handle it, each agency may decide according to the complexity of its personnel management affairs and the provisions of its current organizational law. (2) When implementing the above regulations, each agency should, depending on the circumstances, adhere to the principle of not increasing expenses. (3) In order to facilitate communication and promote efficiency, the personnel management personnel of various agencies may be guided by the Ministry of Personnel within the scope of its capabilities. The Examination Yuan will formulate detailed measures based on the above three principles and submit them for approval and implementation. (16th telegram)</p>

<p>London Yesterday evening, the skies over London were filled with airplanes, as the British Royal Air Force and the German Air Force engaged in fierce battles to determine aerial superiority. German aircraft bombed the suburbs of London, concentrating their efforts on bombing the continental land and sea army center at the mouth of the Thames. Several squadrons of British fighter planes took off to engage, fighting to the death with the German aircraft. Observers claimed that the German side had a three-to-one numerical advantage. The German side may use as many as 5,000 aircraft on any given day. Neutral observers believe that this week's war will culminate in last night's battle over the skies of the British capital, or be a defining feature of this European war. (17th United Press telegram)</p>
<p>London The largest air battle in history unfolded again over London yesterday. More than 2,500 German aircraft launched a major offensive, clashing with thousands of British aircraft in a back-and-forth frenzy, creating a peak in the aerial warfare over London. The densely populated southwestern suburbs of London and various locations at the mouth of the Thames were all targets of German aircraft. There were three wave-like attacks sweeping across the Thames. Large fires and explosions occurred in the suburbs. Although British patrols scattered the first attack, German aircraft continued to break through, bombing the Tilbury docks, shattering stations and houses, causing countless residents to be killed, injured, and maimed. Although the German side boasted that they had inflicted great damage on Britain, London insisted that the damage inflicted by the Germans on British defenses was actually very minor. (17th International News Service telegram)</p>
<p>Sweden According to reports indirectly sent from London by American reporters in the capital, 2,000 German bombers, accompanied by fighter squadrons, appeared over the mouth of the Thames and the southwest triangle yesterday for several hours. London has become a dead city, with ambulances and fire engines rushing through the streets endlessly. The British Broadcasting Corporation admitted that German aircraft were dropping bombs at low altitude, and the Information Department admitted that the station was bombed and caught fire. According to foreign reporters, yesterday's major fires and bombing in London ushered in a new era of world aerial warfare, which is vastly different from the aerial warfare in the Spanish Civil War and the Sino-Japanese War. (17th Haitong telegram)</p>
<p>London Britain today declared that it would attack densely populated areas in Germany to retaliate for yesterday's German bombing of British civilians. However, this warning did not diminish the German attacks. Today, a massive number of German aircraft flew in again for the seventh day of harassment. The German aircraft, like raging tides, poured into British territory, seemingly flying inland from the southeast coast. This situation suggests that Germany is turning a deaf ear to Britain's retaliatory threats. The southwestern outskirts of London were heavily damaged by German aircraft yesterday. While attempting to evade attacks by British fighters, German aircraft dropped thirty to forty bombs in the area within thirty seconds, destroying dozens of houses. Within an area of one British mile, the windows of all buildings were shattered. Yesterday, German aircraft also dropped six delayed-action bombs in the outer circle of London, resulting in the destruction of two more houses. Last night, Nazi aircraft, after conducting nightly air raids on the British Isles, continued to implement Hitler's aerial blitzkrieg today. The aircraft bombed Wales for several hours, destroying many houses in a coastal town and killing several people. The British Air Ministry also admitted today that yesterday's German aircraft inflicted heavy damage on British Air Force airfields. (17th United Press telegram)</p>
<p>London Experiences Its First Air Raid, British Aircraft Intercept and Engage in Fierce Battle</p>
<p>London Since the outbreak of the war, London experienced its first air raid last night. Enemy giant aircraft flew to the southwestern suburbs of London and dropped bombs, destroying or severely damaging a club, a car dealership, and two shops. Several people were killed. A bomb also killed several people in a ticket office at a certain fire station. Enemy aircraft also fired into the streets, shattering window panes and rooftop signs. However, people had taken refuge in air-raid shelters, so there were no injuries. A hospital and a school in the southwest were slightly damaged, and about fifteen other buildings were also damaged, killing one person and slightly injuring another. Many workers' homes were heavily damaged. The windows of houses along many streets were broken and furniture was damaged. Dozens of bombs were dropped in a town in the southeast, killing only one person. A parked truck was also hit by a bomb, killing all three people who were taking shelter under the truck. It is believed that two or three enemy bombers were shot down into the sea during the attack on the town. Thirty German Messerschmitt and Junkers bombers attacked the British mainland and then flew south over the Isle of Wight on their return journey to avoid anti-aircraft fire and British fighters. Machine gun bullets and empty shell casings fell into the streets. One or two enemy aircraft descended very low, as close as twenty-five feet from the ground. Other enemy bombers attacked the mouth of the Thames. British fighters intercepted them and drove them off in a terrifying aerial battle. To date, it is known that more than fifty enemy aircraft were shot down by the British Air Force yesterday. It is reported that twelve British fighters were also lost, but the pilots of eight of them were safe. The Air Ministry issued a communiqué last night reviewing the air battle. According to the communiqué, enemy aerial activity was only on a small scale yesterday morning. In the afternoon, a large formation of bombers approached the southeast coast of Britain, some of which sneaked inland and were intercepted by British fighters. Those that reached the outskirts of London were driven back. The rest flew into the mouth of the Thames and dropped bombs in several locations on both banks of the river. Sheerness and North Foreland were attacked and slightly damaged, with some casualties. German aircraft were subjected to heavy anti-aircraft fire. Some of them circled the southeast of London but did not drop bombs. Shortly after noon, several locations on the south coast were attacked, and the Isle of Wight was bombed, with minimal damage. A British Air Force airfield was also attacked. Later, a large formation of enemy aircraft re-entered the mouth of the Thames and dropped bombs in the southeastern suburbs of London, destroying several houses and causing some casualties. Enemy aircraft attacked several locations again in the evening, but the details are still unknown. British fighters engaged in continuous combat yesterday, destroying more than fifty enemy aircraft. Twelve British fighters were also lost, but the pilots of eight of them were safe. A fierce aerial battle took place over a town in the southeast yesterday afternoon. Aircraft crashed around the town, and aircrew members were seen jumping out with parachutes. Several towns in the southeast were bombed in the evening. A large formation of German bombers was seen flying over a certain town last night, and when they flew back after a while, their number had greatly decreased. Yesterday afternoon, a British fighter in the southeast of Britain shot down two enemy aircraft in two minutes. Seven German crew members were killed. (17th Reuters telegram)</p>
<p>Evening Fog Over British Isles, German Aircraft Active Like Mosquito Swarms</p>
<p>Berlin German raiding aircraft conducted a large-scale air raid on the London area last night, the first since the outbreak of the European war. The German News Agency, in a special report issued last night, gave a detailed account of the German aircraft's flight from its base to its engagement with British aircraft over the British Isles. The news agency said, "German special forces have been ordered to attack all military important targets near the British capital. This air special force is currently en route and has reached the English Channel. The first team of British fighters is already in sight." The air battle was still in progress late last night, so detailed information about the air raid was not available. As of now, the news agency has not revealed the true destination of the special forces, which will only be known after the German aircraft return. The German News Agency said that airfields around London showed "signs of being bombed." "Fires broke out everywhere, houses were destroyed, and the roar of high-explosive bombs indicated that the German bombers' mission had been accomplished. German aircraft also bombed military factories and bomb factories elsewhere." The news agency claimed that German bombers attacked munitions factories and warehouses in London, and large fires were reported to have broken out on both banks of the Thames. The agency continued, "The harbor area of London was severely bombed, and a large power plant was also bombed. German aircraft everywhere encountered enemy forces and engaged in fierce battles. Black clouds, aircraft crashing, parachutes descending, and the white smoke of anti-aircraft shells were seen during the air battles. The number of aircraft shot down seemed quite significant. German reconnaissance aircraft soaring above were broadcasting reports on the progress of the air battles in real time. In the fog over London, fighter planes were as active as mosquito swarms over a swamp, and their number could not be determined, but British 'Hurricanes,' 'Spitfires,' and German 'Messerschmitts' were seen fighting to the death." At midnight, the German News Agency issued a special urgent telegram, stating that "sixty-five British aircraft were shot down, and fifteen German aircraft were missing. "The air battle is still in progress, and new German squadrons are flying across the Channel. (17th United Press telegram)</p>

<p>Berlin News has just been received that German aircraft are active over London. Armories, storage depots, and cold storage facilities on both banks of the Thames have been bombed, causing multiple fires. Thick smoke filled the air, and bomb craters were also faintly visible. The slums in the eastern suburbs of London were shrouded in smoke. The bombs dropped by German aircraft were very accurate. (17th Haitong telegram) When German aircraft attacked the British capital, important facilities north of London were also bombed by German aircraft. The hydroelectric plant in Enfield became a target for German aircraft. German aircraft also bombed armories. Airfields around London suffered heavy losses.

<p>Seventy-Five German Aircraft Destroyed, Britain Admits to Losing Twenty-Two</p>
<p>London After seventy-five German aircraft were shot down yesterday, the total number of German Air Force losses since the start of the intensive bombing on August 8 has reached 542. During the same period, British aircraft losses totaled 134, including the twenty-two destroyed yesterday. However, fifty pilots have safely escaped. The Air Ministry announced that the exact number of German losses during the German air raid on Britain on Thursday has now been ascertained to be 180. Since Sunday, anti-aircraft batteries have shot down 57 German bombers and fighters. (17th Reuters telegram)</p>
<p>Berlin This afternoon, the German military communiqué stated that yesterday the German Air Force attacked airfields, anti-aircraft battery positions, munitions factories in the Midlands, Cardiff, Newport, and port facilities in Bristol in the southeast of Britain and the suburbs of London, day and night. German aircraft returned successfully. A British destroyer was sunk near the Isle of Wight. There were several fierce battles between British and German destroyers. German bombers were able to hit their targets. Last night, British aircraft attacked Germany, causing very little damage. Although several houses were hit by bombs, only two residents were killed and several were injured. In total, eighty-nine enemy aircraft were lost yesterday, including fifty-nine shot down in aerial combat, twenty-three destroyed on the ground, seven shot down by anti-aircraft fire at night, and twenty-two barrage balloons shot down. Thirty-one German aircraft were missing. German submarines sank several armed merchant ships, totaling 25,700 tons, including an oil tanker with a tonnage of 5,700 tons. (17th Reuters telegram)</p>

<p>Berlin Some of the German destroyer aircraft selected by the Guardian of the German aircraft squadron heading to Britain engaged with British aircraft off the south coast of England, but the second batch of German dive bombers soon arrived and accurately bombed ordnance factories and facilities in the port. As the giant bombs fell, the roars seemed to come from the deep. Explosions and large fires occurred several times in Purfleet on the outskirts of London and Barking in the northwest suburbs. (17th Haitong telegram)</p>
<p>Berlin The commander of the German squadron bombing London reported that two squadrons of German fighters had broken through the aerial barrage balloons and entered London's sky. Three squadrons of German bombers had found their designated targets in western London and carried out bombings. Two squadrons had already returned to Germany. Details of the enemy's losses have not yet been received. A major aerial battle is currently taking place in the skies over London. British aircraft are striving to protect the British capital from the poison of the German squadron. It can be seen that the British know that the time has come. The skies of London are almost filled with Spitfires and Hurricanes, interspersed with German Messerschmitts. There are obviously more British aircraft than German aircraft. Clashes between the two aircraft can be seen everywhere, along with parachutes, the yellow smoke of anti-aircraft guns, and the flames and fireworks of destroyed aircraft on the ground. The number of aircraft shot down is very large. German reconnaissance aircraft are continuously reporting on the progress of the air battle. (17th Haitong telegram)</p>
<p>Berlin The commander of the first German bomber squadron, returning from completing its mission in Middlesex, reported that each aircraft bombed air force bases in the western district of London, with aircraft hangars and barracks hit and set on fire.

<p>London On August 15, the British Air Force bombers once again demonstrated their power in enemy territory, conducting night raids on four countries: Italy, Germany, France, and the Netherlands, fiercely bombing military targets. According to an aviation announcement, the Fiat aircraft engine factory in Turin, Italy, and the Caproni aircraft factory in Milan were both bombed. It was learned that these two factories had been heavily damaged by bombing a few days ago. A smelting plant near Genoa was also bombed. A large number of British bombers also attacked oil refineries in Gelsenkirchen and Reisholz, Germany, munitions factories in Röhning, Essen, and Düsseldorf, the docks in Emmerich on the German-Dutch border, warehouses in Hamm and Soest, and several airfields in Germany, the Netherlands, and France. British coastal aircraft squadrons attacked shipyards in Schiedam, Netherlands, and shot down an enemy seaplane during a night patrol. A total of three British aircraft went missing. The Air Ministry Information Office announced that when British aircraft continued to attack Italian production centers, heavy smoke made visibility difficult. However, based on what was seen, the two Italian aircraft factories bombed on Tuesday night were indeed heavily damaged. They were attacked again the previous night, with hits, fires, and explosions. One aircraft dropped several bombs that went straight through the glass roof of the Fiat factory and exploded upon impact. When British aircraft attacked Schiedam, they dropped several bombs on the wharves, causing fires and explosions. When British aircraft attacked Germany, they fiercely bombed oil refineries and oil tanks in the Ruhr area. Gelsenkirchen was the first to bear the brunt, with two oil depots in the area being bombed by two squadrons of British aircraft in turn for about two hours. A high-explosive bomb hit an oil refinery repeatedly, causing fires in at least twenty-five locations. Another oil refinery nearby also erupted in large fires, with flames soaring into the sky. The Röhning munitions factory was heavily defended, with anti-aircraft batteries, searchlights, and barrage balloons, but British aircraft still overcame all difficulties, dropping over seventeen tons of high-explosive bombs and hundreds of incendiary bombs. Hamm was attacked for the fiftieth time, and the Krupp armory in Essen, which had been heavily damaged in a large-scale air raid, was again subjected to intensive bombing. The Ruhwarden aircraft factory in northern Netherlands was bombed at low altitude by British aircraft. Hangers were hit, and aircraft around the airfield were attacked and caught fire.

<p>Berlin The "Do 215" aircraft, recently manufactured by the German Dornier aircraft factory, is a modified version of the "Do 17" aircraft and is generally known as the "Flying Pencil." After its first public exhibition yesterday, it was used to bomb the British Isles. The "Do 7" aircraft is similar to the "Do 215" aircraft in all aspects. During yesterday's demonstration flight, the new aircraft proved that it could take off from land and fly straight into the sky in a short period of time, with extremely high speed. It also descended vertically during landing and then soared back into the air, flipping and tumbling. The pilot suddenly descended rapidly from the sky, like flying scissors. The aircraft then landed at the airfield, using only one engine, proving that if the engine was damaged, another engine could be used, and it could still fly and take off and land as usual. Many experts were among the spectators at the scene, and they all believed that the new type of aircraft would be very effective in bombing Britain. (17th Haitong Agency telegram)</p>

Germany has repeatedly warned these countries and has again urged these neutral governments to pay attention in official diplomatic notes. These countries should accept these requests as much as possible for their own interests. The German government must declare that naval warfare around the British Isles is in full swing. The entire area has been mined, and aircraft squadrons are attacking any ships. Neutral ships navigating in this area in the future are in danger of destruction.

<h3 id="e26">US President Announces: Negotiations Underway with Britain, Hoping to Obtain Naval and Air Bases, Expanding Defense Across Both Oceans <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>Washington - President Roosevelt, in a historic announcement yesterday, stated that the United States is conducting negotiations to obtain British territories in the Atlantic as naval and air bases, in order to protect the Panama Canal and the Western Hemisphere. If so, the long-held British traditional maxim that the British Empire will never relinquish sovereignty over its territories will become meaningless, and the British government is already engaged in a struggle for survival in the British Isles. What Britain will gain in return for ceding these bases remains a mystery. President Roosevelt declined to answer reporters' questions about what the US is offering in return to Britain, but instructed reporters to be careful not to confuse the matter with the so-called destroyer issue. Previously, the United States acquired a naval base in the Caribbean when former US President Wilson purchased the Virgin Islands from Denmark in 1916. The Virgin Islands were not only an important defense point for the Panama Canal but also a valuable coal-producing area at the time. Since US warships no longer use coal as fuel, the Virgin Islands have become a valuable naval and air base, with Saint Thomas being one of the best harbors in the region. Roosevelt's actions yesterday are based on the recent US policy of expanding the defense of Panama as much as possible to reach both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, so that any powerful enemy cannot cross this vast ocean surface to approach the Panama Canal. Haiti, the Dominican Republic, and other neighboring countries in the Caribbean have all expressed their willingness to cooperate with the United States in any way. The United States also has the Guantanamo base and has increased its military equipment and developed it into a year-round base, no longer used only as a winter training ground. At 10:30 yesterday morning, news reporters gathered at the White House for the president's briefing. People generally believed that there would be important news to hear, and everyone expected to hear about the United States obtaining certain benefits in exchange for aiding Britain. Many people are making great efforts, hoping that the United States will take some action to save Britain from its critical situation. Since Britain concentrated its efforts on defending its own country and abandoned its interests in the Far East, such as the Shanghai defense area, some speculation has arisen in Washington that the United States is currently discussing a good opportunity regarding the British Caribbean islands. These islands have no special value to Britain, whether strategically or commercially, but are extremely important for the United States to defend the Panama Canal and prevent European countries from further aggression against the Americas. When President Roosevelt spoke to reporters, he began by saying that the Department of the Army had agreed to disclose the fact that two US military officers had been invited by the British government to serve as observers in Britain. The United States is currently negotiating with the British government to obtain naval and air bases to defend the Americas, especially the Panama Canal. Traditionally, when the US President speaks to the press, direct quotations are not necessarily used, but yesterday President Roosevelt often reversed this practice in his natural disclosure or in answering reporters' questions. The President said that the United States is currently holding talks with the British Empire to discuss obtaining naval bases for the defense of the Western Hemisphere.</p>
<p>The US and Canadian Governments Are Also Conducting Defense Talks</p>
<p>The US government is also conducting talks with the Canadian government regarding the defense of the Western Hemisphere. The President explained that the nature of these two matters is absolutely different. The situation in Canada is absolutely different from other British territories such as Trinidad, Barbados, Bermuda, and Jamaica, because Canada may become an active battlefield due to an enemy from elsewhere in the world or from Europe invading. The Caribbean islands have unlimited value in defending against any enemy from the Canary Islands, the Azores, or Dakar, Africa, attempting to attack the Panama Canal area and establish a base of operations in Brazil or Venezuela. Recalling the War Debt Commission, previously headed by General Butler, it repeatedly suggested to the countries that owed the most war debts to the United States, such as Britain and France, that they cede some of their islands as payment of war debts. This commission, because of its strong advocacy of using islands to repay war debts, has been renamed the "Island Debt Repayment Commission." During the economic weakness of the United States in the past few years, it has not been eager to seek any of these European territories. Since the Panama Conference decided on a security zone, this matter has become a matter of attention, because within this zone, there are many British islands. As to whether the United States needs all the islands is still unknown. President Roosevelt's words are not clear on this point. President Roosevelt only said that the United States hopes to obtain naval and air bases for the defense of the Western Hemisphere, but did not specify which islands, nor did he say whether the Atlantic islands are also included. In conclusion, the President solemnly stated that he could not yet say how the United States would pay for these islands, whether in cash, deducted from war debts, or by other means. People around the world now know that Britain will cede some territory to the United States, and the United States is gradually increasing its status and becoming a truly world power. Last week, the exiled Soviet communist Trotsky, in an interview with the press in Coyoacán, Mexico, said that the result of Germany's invasion of Britain would be to increase the power of the United States in the Western Hemisphere. This statement is worth noting. It is also generally speculated that President Roosevelt may hope to obtain one or two naval and air bases on the US east coast to protect the Atlantic, just as Hawaii protects the Pacific.

<p>Washington - Political figures here say that as a result of the meeting between Roosevelt and King, the United States and Canada may reach an agreement. Roosevelt once declared, "Britain, the United States, and Canada are already in negotiations regarding the establishment of US military bases in the West Indies." As for the realization of a defense alliance between the US and Canada, it also seems to be just around the corner. However, the White House previously stated that this was a rumor and has not yet confirmed it. Roosevelt warned reporters not to arbitrarily associate or make rash judgments about his talks with King. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>Washington - It is generally believed here that the negotiations between the US and Canada are largely about building bases in New Brunswick or Nova Scotia. These two Canadian provinces protrude into the Atlantic Ocean and are closer to Europe. These two provinces may already believe that they should be within the Western Hemisphere defense zone. Insiders here are speculating whether the US and Canada negotiations will result in a mutual assistance agreement so that if the US and Canada are threatened, the US can send troops to Canada and utilize Canada's naval and air bases. It is believed that these negotiations may lead to the establishment of a joint US-Canada military consultation and action. (United Press International dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>Washington - Congressman Vinson, Chairman of the House Naval Affairs Committee, commented on President Roosevelt's announcement regarding the search for naval and air bases for the defense of the Panama Canal, saying that the US deployment of bases is necessary for the defense of the Panama Canal.

At the same time, it was also heard that British Prime Minister Churchill, after disclosing the progress of Washington, London, and Ottawa on this issue, stated that Britain would immediately build effective bases in Bermuda, the Bahamas, Barbados, Jamaica, the Turks and Caicos Islands, the Cayman Islands, the Leeward Islands, Tobago, and Trinidad. However, rumors that Britain would propose selling some islands to the United States were denied by British officials here last night. It is said that the rumor is completely unfounded. (International News Service dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>Washington - President Roosevelt announced here yesterday that the US government is in contact with Britain regarding the transfer of British naval and air bases in the Western Hemisphere to the United States to enhance the defense of the Western Hemisphere. President Roosevelt divided these negotiations into three categories: (1) negotiations in Britain, (2) negotiations in Canada, (3) US observers staying in Britain to witness the situation of German attacks and report to the government at any time. The President made it clear that he is personally participating in the negotiations with the United Kingdom and is conducting all ordinary conversations in order to discover new tools for implementing the Monroe Doctrine. When asked whether the President agreed with the lengthy article published yesterday in the New York Times, which advocated that the President could sell destroyers to Britain without further authorization from the legislature, the President said that he had seen the article but had not read it himself, so he could not criticize it in detail. Similarly, the President declined to predict what reaction the Department of Justice would have to the issue of authorizing him to sell destroyers to Britain. However, he said that Attorney General Jackson had not yet expressed his opinion on the matter. It is recalled here that Jackson had previously prevented the proposal to sell 23 new high-speed light cruisers to Britain. Previously, these warships were originally training ships. The destroyers that Britain currently needs are purely warships needed for the war. Roosevelt, while on his way to the Canadian border to inspect military exercises there, said that he was busy with national defense matters and would not have time on Saturday and Sunday to listen to Wilkie's radio broadcast upon accepting the Republican presidential nomination. The President also declined to disclose the secret mission of Rear Admiral Greenslade of the Naval Board Committee to Martinique, but he said that Greenslade's trip was related to negotiations with Britain. Although Roosevelt did not specify the status of the bases south of Britain, it is widely believed that the most important of these will be near "Trinidad" or "Barbados," as these two locations have long been regarded as weaknesses in the Panama Canal defense line. Moreover, these two locations are closer to Europe than the Caribbean Islands. The lack of military defense in the area would leave the Panama Canal defenseless against external attacks. (United Press International dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>Washington - President Roosevelt stated yesterday while receiving news reporters that the US government is now holding talks with Britain to discuss the US seeking naval and air bases, and at the same time, pay attention to the Panama Canal. The United States is also holding talks with Canada, and he is concerned about the defense of the Western Hemisphere. Although the President warned reporters not to associate this matter with speculation about the United States selling destroyers to Britain, a certain political reporter in the United States told Reuters after the meeting that Britain will definitely obtain these destroyers, as it is generally believed that this is a way to pay for the bases. Congressional opposition may not be avoided, but the need for the United States to obtain a naval base in the West Indies has long been recognized by people in Washington, so the United States will not hesitate to give something in exchange. As for the intense opposition from a small number of isolationists, it is certainly bound to exist. The US President's speech to news reporters was delivered with a firm attitude, a characteristic that has been lacking for several weeks. The President resolutely announced his intentions without waiting for the hundred or so attendees to ask questions. Some observers speculate that the President intends to quickly implement various plans to aid Britain at a time when the public is focusing its attention on the great war currently in the skies over Britain.

If Romania has authorized Lin to agree to Bao's entire request, the negotiations may be reopened as a result. If things can be reconciled, then the preliminary discussions will focus on the specific issue of the cession of Dobruja. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 17th)</p>

<h3 id="e35">Guangxi University Strives to Expand (Part 2) - Increasing Departments and Adding Agricultural Farms - Annual Recurring Expenses Supplied by the National Treasury <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>Since the school was changed to national status, all annual recurring and special expenses have been fully provided by the National Treasury. However, due to the Guangxi Provincial Government's keen concern for the school, for the first semester after the change to national status, the provincial government provided 230,000 yuan for the school's annual recurring expenses, and the National Treasury provided 200,000 yuan, totaling 430,000 yuan. As for the expenses for the 29th year of the Republic (1940), the budget includes 800,000 yuan for annual recurring expenses and 480,000 yuan for special expenses, totaling 1,280,000 yuan, all of which are to be provided by the National Treasury. However, this budget has not yet been approved. In addition, there are various other subsidies, including 60,000 yuan annually from the British Boxer Indemnity for the Department of Electrical Engineering, 10,000 yuan annually from the French Boxer Indemnity, and 1,800 US dollars for unspecified purposes. The China Foundation for the Promotion of Education and Culture provides a subsidy of 500,000 yuan for unspecified purposes. In short, since the school was changed to national status last autumn, the annual expenses, including the National Treasury's supply and various subsidies, total no less than 1,700,000 yuan, an increase of slightly less than one-half compared to when it was provincial. Moreover, the National Treasury's supply has been approved by the Supreme National Defense Council. Following this, the school's facilities will inevitably become more and more complete. The school currently has 67 professors, 13 associate professors, 28 lecturers, 41 male teaching assistants, 3 female teaching assistants, and a total of 390 other faculty and staff. There are 195 workers in the school. There are 356 students in the Faculty of Arts and Law and 157 students in the Faculty of Agriculture. The school has a total of 844 students (excluding preparatory classes, as of February of the 29th year of the Republic [1940]). Regarding the students' origins, Guangxi accounts for about one-tenth, followed by the neighboring provinces of Guangdong and Hunan. However, there are also students from provinces as far away as Liaoning and Jilin, and as remote as Shaanxi and Yunnan, totaling 18 provinces and regions. Previously, Guangxi students accounted for more than three-quarters of the school's students, and the provinces included only Guangxi, Guangdong, and Hunan. Therefore, we can see from this number representing the index that the school, after being changed to national status, can indeed transform from a local to a national, and from a small-scale to a large-scale educational implementation.

<p>Calligraphy is the only art form unique to China. Other Kharosthi scripts are all recording tools and do not have independent artistic value. China has spared no effort in promoting calligraphy, but has focused on steles and neglected ink traces. The famous painters Wu Hufan and Chen Dieye of Shanghai, in view of this, and also because painters have been able to write well since ancient times, initiated the Exhibition of Paintings and Calligraphy. Participants include Zheng Wuchang, Gao Shengbo, Fu Tienian, Xu Bangda, Ying Yeping, He Tianjian, Ma Gongyu, Lou Xinhu, Xia Jingguan, Shen Jianzhi, and more than 50 others. There are more than 300 pieces of exquisite works on display. It is scheduled to be publicly exhibited on the fourth floor of Daxin from August 19th. The grand occasion is bound to be unprecedented.</p>

<h3 id="e48">Another Suggestion for Charity Basketball Challenge <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>Editor, I read the letter from Mr. Zhang Hongsheng published in your newspaper yesterday, suggesting launching a charity basketball challenge, advocating the collection of strong players scattered in other teams, mixed into three or four strong teams, to challenge the Bolemen team, which has already steadily won the United Cup championship and the last Xiqing League champion, in order to solve the Shanghai basketball hegemony, and at the same time greatly contribute to charity. The intention is very good. I am devoted to basketball and must go to every game. I am confident that I have a further understanding of the current situation of Shanghai basketball. Therefore, I naturally agree with Mr. Zhang's suggestion in principle, but I feel that it is necessary to make another statement based on the facts regarding the current situation in the basketball circle. Recently, the United Cup was launched, and Shanghai Qing, with the momentum of the Zhongqing League champion, combined with the old Ministry of Hualian, intended to compete with Bolemen for a short day with the power of thunder, but because of the hasty merger, the style was not unified, and because of one wrong move, it was defeated by Bolemen again. The most tragic thing is that it suffered three defeats in six games. However, the reasons for Shanghai Qing's three defeats cannot be generalized. The generals were indeed injured in the two battles lost to Liangxi and Qunyi, so there is still something to say about the crime of not fighting. However, in the battle against Bolemen, Shanghai Qing once gathered the most complete lineup to respond. Mr. Zhang said that it was "not as good as the real strength" and blamed it on fate, but I dare not say that.</p>
<p>As for Mr. Zhang's proposal to gather strong players to form three or four strong teams to recruit battles, there is still room for discussion. The difficulty of forming a mixed team and selecting players to play will become the biggest and most serious problem. Although Bolemen can defeat this mixed team of concentrated elites, it will naturally increase its position as the sea hegemon. If the mixed team wins, the name of the Shanghai League champion will still be difficult to attribute, but it can only be said that the "winner" has been broken. Therefore, I think it is better to still take each club as a unit, and challenge Bolemen in the original name. Players should be supplemented as much as possible, and the venue may be chosen by the challenger itself, because each team is more familiar with the home court and it is not without convenience. At the same time, Bolemen's venue is too small, and it also feels that it cannot be developed on a large scale. Therefore, the Zhongqing mentioned by Mr. Zhang is the most ideal venue.</p>
<p>This matter is of great importance, for charity and for hegemony, and depends on the efforts of the industry to promote it. Bolemen and other strong teams are usually courageous to go to justice, and they will be happy to comply with this grand event. I have collected my humble opinions to contribute a bit of insight. Respectfully presented by reader Sun Qihuang on August 17th.</p>
<p>(Editor's Note) Mr. Zhang Hongsheng's letter advocating a charity challenge to solve the Shanghai basketball hegemony has just been disclosed, and yesterday we received a letter from reader Sun Qihuang in response, and offered other opinions. It shows the concern of those who love basketball. This newspaper absolutely agrees with the former, and is optimistic about its success. However, I hope that the strong basketball teams in Shanghai will respond together so that they can achieve smooth progress, and the Bolemen authorities will also be happy to accept the challenge. If both parties express their consent, the public opinion community will definitely do its best to promote its success.</p>

<h3 id="e49">Finance - Considerable Turnover in Foreign Exchange Resales <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>The foreign exchange market yesterday saw HSBC's listed prices remain unchanged, while the unofficial market for British and American currencies remained sluggish due to frequent negative news, such as reports that Germany might re-mediate in the Sino-Japanese War, which greatly affected sentiment. Buyers were absent, and the market trended towards weakness from opening to closing without any signs of recovery. Many speculators sold, and Hong Kong Electric also dumped, along with sales from China Bank and American Bank. The US dollar reached 5.625 yuan by midday, but was still difficult to unload, eventually closing at the weakest price. British gold closed at 3 shillings 7 1/875 pence, and the US dollar closed at 5.625 yuan, slightly weaker by .015625 compared to the previous close for British gold, and sharply higher by .125 for the US dollar. The futures market followed the spot market.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Electric and Japanese Factories Dumped</p>
<p>The morning started with London rates being strong, nearly reaching a 25-point premium. New York silver prices remained stable, and London spot gold was fixed. The exchange rates between the British pound and the US dollar were unchanged, and the exchange rate against Shanghai was also stable. The US dollar was slightly higher against the British pound by half a point, sharply higher against Shanghai by four points, and there was no market for French francs. The central bank's listed rates for various currencies remained the same. Banks opened in the morning with a spot selling price of 3 shillings 7.03125 pence for British gold and 5.5 yuan for the US dollar, unchanged from the previous day's close for both British and American currencies. After opening, speculators were the first to sell, and the market was quite firm. Speculators sold US dollars for August delivery to Sassoon at 5.5625 yuan. HSBC's listed prices remained unchanged, and the white silver parity tax remained unchanged. Afterwards, Japanese cotton mills, Hong Kong Electric, and speculators all dumped heavily, and the underlying trend became increasingly weak. At that time, negative rumors gradually spread, so there was a lack of buyers, and external interest was poor. External merchants absorbed August US dollars from Japanese cotton mills, Hong Kong Electric, and speculators at 5.59375 yuan. In addition, Hong Kong Electric sold a forward contract at 3 shillings 7.1875 pence. After 11:00 AM, China Bank and American Bank also tended to sell, selling August US dollars to external merchants, all at 5.59375 yuan. As it approached noon, the market continued to be firm, and China Bank Shanghai had US dollars from American Bank, reaching 5.625 yuan. At the closing, it was still difficult to deal with, and British gold closed at 3 shillings 7.1875 pence, and the US dollar closed at 5.625 yuan. Next month's British gold closed at 3 shillings 7.03125 pence, and the US dollar closed at 5.59375 yuan, weaker by .015625 for both spot and futures British gold, and sharply higher by .125 for the US dollar, compared to yesterday's close. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday.</p>
<p>Hong Kong US Dollar Eases</p>
<p>Hong Kong, August 17 (Saturday dispatch). Exchange rates were unchanged today. (The US dollar closed at 22.375 yuan yesterday.) The Shanghai exchange spot rate was 0.5 yuan, at 401.5 yuan. The Japanese exchange spot rate was up half a yuan, at 94 yuan. Stable at 10:10 AM. The US dollar spot rate eased by .0625, to 22.4375 yuan. Turning firm at 11:30 AM. The US dollar spot rate continued to ease by .1875, to 22.625 yuan. The Shanghai exchange spot rate continued to fall by 1.5 yuan, to 401 yuan. The rest remained unchanged. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday.</p>
<p>Tianjin British and American Currencies Rise Together</p>
<p>Tianjin, August 17 (Saturday) dispatch. The exchange market opened weak this morning. The spot rate for British currency rose by .05125, to 3 pence 4.0325. The spot rate for the US dollar rose by .0625, to 5.123 yuan. The Shanghai exchange rate rose by 1.75 yuan, to 110 yuan.

<h3 id="e50">Rumors Spread Widely - Gold Price Decline Expands <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the black market for spot gold continued its downward trend. Operators who had long held bullish views dumped their positions at once, and buying sentiment was exceptionally scattered due to widespread rumors that Germany was said to be mediating in the Sino-Japanese War, creating an atmosphere of peace in the market and causing foreign exchange to strengthen sharply, and gold prices to follow suit. The market opened relatively stable at 5,760 yuan, but aggressive selling from gold shops pushed the price down to 5,730 yuan. Later, thanks to forceful buying by a money exchange, the price recovered to 5,755 yuan. However, due to the aforementioned influence, selling pressure suddenly increased, and gold and silver shops dumped their holdings, driving the price down to a low of 5,655 yuan. The midday close was only 5,660 yuan, a drastic fall of 112 yuan compared to the previous day. However, based on the US dollar settlement price, it had already been suppressed by as much as 560 yuan. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday. About 2,000 taels were traded in half a day. Jewelry gold decreased by a small amount of ten yuan, and customs gold prices remained stable.</p>
<p>Spot Gold Falls by Over 100 Yuan</p>
<p>Since the morning, the market initially weakened by 12 yuan per bar (ten taels) due to the strengthening of the foreign exchange market and the inherent weakness of the previous day's trend. Silver shops were the first to sell 20 taels of securities at 5,760 yuan. Subsequently, due to competitive selling from gold shops, the price fell another 30 yuan, and silver shops sold 20 taels of securities at 5,730 yuan. Then, thanks to repeated buying by a certain money exchange, it soon rose back to 5,755 yuan. After that, foreign exchange continued to weaken, and there were negative news reports. A certain silver shop was the first to short sell, and a certain gold shop reapplied pressure, selling a considerable amount, and soon retreated to the 5,700 yuan mark. A silver shop sold 10 taels to a gold shop at 5,690 yuan. At that time, short covering caused the price to rebound to 5,708 yuan. However, selling pressure soon resumed, and both jewelry shops and gold shops were selling, and some money exchanges closed their long positions, causing the price to fall to a low of 5,655 yuan before closing, but the closing price was 5,660 yuan. As a result, it was a drastic fall of 112 yuan compared to the previous day, with fluctuations of 105 yuan in half a day. The selling price of spot gold from the cash shops was tens of yuan higher than that of spot gold, and the purchasing price was 30 yuan lower. The current bid price for gold is more than 50 yuan lower than the listed price for gold.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Down Another Small Amount of Ten Yuan</p>
<p>The exchange price of jewelry gold per tael initially remained at 590 yuan by Dahang firms, but at about 11:00 AM, it was lowered by a small amount of ten yuan, and remained unchanged thereafter. Dahang firms lowered it to 580 yuan, while the new firms kept the same price as before, and the purchasing price was reduced by about 30 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e51">Discount Rate Recovers by Four Yuan <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's discount rate for foreign exchange bills initially decreased, then suddenly and sharply increased. The discount rate per thousand yuan once fell to about 28 yuan, then gradually recovered to a discount rate of 30 yuan for discounting in and 32 yuan for discounting out. In the afternoon, it rose again to 37 yuan, with a discount rate of 35 yuan for discounting in, an increase of four yuan compared to the previous day. The interbank lending rate of the Money Dealers Association was lowered by one point, set at twelve points.</p>
<h3 id="e52">US Exchange Certificates Plunge - Australian Certificates Transacted Yesterday <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's market for foreign currencies saw the severe decline in spot gold causing a strong supply of British and American gold pounds, and market prices consistently trended towards weakness. There was also no shortage of supply for British gold certificates, with prices falling by two jiao. Due to the easing of the black market US dollar exchange rate and the resurfacing of the Sino-Japanese peace atmosphere, there was an exceptionally strong supply of US dollar certificates, and market prices declined linearly. After opening at 18.08 yuan, it once retreated to 17.62 yuan, eventually settling at 17.65 yuan, a decline of 4.5 jiao. The supply and demand for Hong Kong certificates were stable, and market prices were stable. Certificates for Singapore, Canada, and the Philippines all trended lower. Australian gold certificates were rarely traded, but some transactions took place yesterday, with market prices plunging by twelve yuan. The supply and demand for Japanese gold certificates were balanced, and market prices were stable, with the night market still at 1.355 yuan. Korean certificates continued to rebound, with the night market at 1.03 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e53">Securities - Domestic Bonds Becoming Firmer <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>The securities market was still very good yesterday. With the sudden decrease in gold prices, people became more firm in their convictions. The change in environmental conditions seemed to be gradually improving, and there was a trend of turning danger into safety. All kinds of unofficial news continued to come, and between rumors and reality, morale was increasingly excited. The recent decline in various interest rates and the flow of idle funds into the public debt market was also a major reason. The gradual rise of investors recently is enough to confirm that this statement is not false. The outlook is optimistic, and the dominant sentiment has been positive for some time. Yesterday's transactions saw Hengkang and Hengfu still have an appetite to buy, and Hongda's purchases were also quite strong. Hongkang and Lianyi also had needs. Tongkang covered shorts, and Runli consistently sold. Tongshen suddenly released a large number of Class D shares, and Lianhe bulls took profits. The supply and demand for warrants was still insufficient. This was because banks and private individuals had closed out a lot of positions in recent days. Therefore, the one-day result was still a rise of one or two jiao. The total volume of transactions was over one million yuan. A summary table is listed below.</p>
<p>The stock trading saw 40 shares of the Family Industry Association traded at a price of 76 yuan per share.</p>
<p>London, August 16 (Friday dispatch). Today's listed prices for Chinese foreign debt and Far East British commercial company stocks were generally sluggish. Bank stocks were slightly weaker. Chartered Mercantile Bank stocks fell 3 shillings and 9 pence, to 6 pounds 11 shillings and 3 pence. Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank stocks each fell half a pound, to 62 pounds for shares registered in London and 68 pounds for shares registered in Hong Kong. The rest remained unchanged.</p>
<h3 id="e54">Grains and Sundries - Soybean Demand Still Strong <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's soybean market remained strong. New beans were still lacking in arrivals, and demand from various firms was still strong, with prices rising steadily. However, high selling prices inevitably lead to expectations, so the origin of Qingdao beans seemed to be continually strained. Yesterday, the selling of these beans was not as aggressively overbid as in the previous two days, so it would not be surprising if the underlying trend were to rise sharply and then pull back slightly. Yesterday's statistics showed that over 400 bags of Qingdao beans were traded at 34 yuan, 120 bags of Anqing beans were traded at 32.8 yuan, 200 bags of Sangyuan beans were traded at 31.8 yuan, and 100 bags of Pudong Doudou beans were traded at 33 yuan. More than 100 bags of Chongming Sand Yellow beans were traded at 29 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e55">Coal - Puhuang Coal Sells Well <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>Although the bituminous coal market has been very sluggish in recent days due to seasonal factors, new goods continue to arrive in port in an endless stream. Yesterday, a foreign firm had an order for Puhuang coal delivered, which it was selling in the market. Block coal was priced at 160 yuan per ton, coal dust at 120 yuan, and mixed coal at 145 yuan. The cost of delivery from the warehouse must be added separately.</p>
<h3 id="e56">Grains Rice Continues to Arrive in Shanghai, Speculation Causes a Stir Without Possibility of Sale <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>The foreign rice market, after a period of tightness in the previous dynasty, yesterday showed a pattern of initial tightness followed by weakness. The result was an up-and-down movement, remaining roughly equal, with little gain or loss. When trading opened in the morning, both buyers and sellers, buoyed by the previous day's momentum, held firm. Sellers tried to push prices up, and shouts were high, while general speculative trading also sought to stir up waves and continue absorbing supply. At the time, the situation seemed quite promising, but mainland merchants and local shops engaged in actual sales were wary of their large inventories and knew speculative trading was unreliable. They maintained a conservative approach, refraining from rashly following the trend and only making necessary purchases. Therefore, apart from small orders, there were few wholesale transactions, causing speculators to lose their footing and gradually shift from buying to selling. As a result, prices at each level, which had been raised by several jiao, fell. Even the original packaged Saigon No. 2 rice, which had risen from 62.5 yuan to 63 yuan, and Siamese rice transferred from Saigon, which had reached 64 yuan, began to decline. Original packaged Saigon Siamese rice lacked buyers, and spot rice actually fell by three to five jiao. A total of 8,000 bags of spot rice were traded throughout the day, amounting to 325 tons of original packaged rice.</p>
<p>More foreign rice arrived in Shanghai. The "Wah Lun" and "Haidar" ships of Jardine Matheson arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning, directly carrying 16,548 bags of foreign rice from Siam, docked at Pier 15 on Renji Road Bund for unloading.</p>
<p>Wu Xian rice continued to arrive for several days, with over 2,000 more bags arriving yesterday. The market has accumulated about 27,000 to 28,000 bags of both new and old Xian rice, it is said.</p>
<p>Rumors suggest that transactions of Japonica and glutinous domestic rice in the unofficial market remained normal. Therefore, although arrivals stopped yesterday, the market did not change and remained at the original levels. The source of new Japonica rice from Zhoupu continued, and the sales area was wider than before. Supply and demand were balanced, and prices showed little fluctuation, with large market goods at 61 yuan and special grades at 62 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e57">Sharp Decrease in Domestic Factory Production Drives Buying Interest from Various Parties <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>Flour: The market was stable yesterday. The price of local flour remained at 15 yuan, with only the Fufeng factory supplying 2,000 to 3,000 bags. The market sales were dominated by Japanese "Phoenix" brand flour, priced at 14.6 jiao for this month, 14.8 jiao for September, and 14.95 jiao for October. A total of 7,000 to 8,000 bags were traded, with participation from local merchants and those from the north and south. Speculators were also inquiring, as the suspension of production by domestic factories led to upward expectations. Therefore, a significant amount of returned goods were absorbed in the market in recent days, and the market was driven up by these actions. Transactions of foreign flour remained slow, and little mainland flour was traded. In addition to a small supply from the Fufeng factory, some leftover goods of Fuxin brand were also distributed, so the market did not see a resurgence, it is said.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday, the new wheat market gradually tightened unofficially. As the "Phoenix" flour sold well recently, the Sanxin factory needed more raw materials. Additionally, reports of rising wheat prices in the mainland led suppliers to push prices aggressively. High-quality wheat prices rose to 20.05 to 20.06 yuan, while its determination remained at about 10 yuan. The purchase price for domestic factories had to be above 22 yuan, but there were still no large-scale purchases. The overall market trading was mainly focused on Japanese factories, with daily purchases of about 4,000 bags of various wheat types.</p>
<h3 id="e58">Sugar Market: Chartered White Retreats <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trended downwards due to the rise in foreign exchange rates. The guild set the prices for spot goods: first-grade coarse white sugar at 72.5 yuan in the morning and 72 yuan in the afternoon at the local warehouses, a decrease of 1 yuan; 72 yuan to 71.6 jiao at the other warehouses, a decrease of 0.9 yuan; transit goods with warehouse receipts at 56.5 yuan, and goods delivered on the 22nd at 57.5 yuan to 57 yuan, a decrease of 0.5 yuan; Taikoo chartered white B mark at 75 yuan, a decrease of 0.3 yuan; HX mark at 72 yuan; H mark chartered at 58 yuan, a decrease of 0.1 yuan; Dutch red remained at 60 yuan; local factory snow white at 71 yuan; first-grade crystal at 90.5 yuan; Jingming crystal at 92 yuan; several dozen bags of Dagong powdered white sugar were offered by the Xinghua group at 88 yuan; and the Guangdong group continued to offer over 700 bags of oil-packed Dongxiang red sugar, with the goods being fresher and the determined price at 51 yuan; high-quality white sugar was offered at 54 to 55 yuan, but no transactions were made. (The previous day, the price of Dongxiang red sugar was incorrectly printed as 58.5 yuan instead of 52.5 yuan; this is hereby corrected.) On the 17th, 1,700 tons of sugar arrived from the Netherlands.</p>
<h3 id="e59">Yarn &amp; Cotton: Supply Exceeds Demand, Yarn Market Unlikely to Rise <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market opened high but closed low, with the situation returning to stability and weakness. This was because the current yarn sales market showed no signs of active purchasing. Therefore, although general bulls had upward intentions, their resolve was not strong enough. They sought to sell as soon as they could profit. The current yarn market is in a situation where supply exceeds demand, which is enough to prevent it from moving forward. Once the market has matured and sales are not smooth, there will be significant changes.</p>
<p>Spot yarn opened in the morning with sentiment carried over from the previous day, and bulls continued to shout wildly. 20-count Bianma was priced at 910 yuan, slightly falling to 107 yuan. Later, the bulls pulled the price up, gradually rising to 922 yuan. Once the high price was seen, buyers disappeared, and the market entered a dull state, turning downwards and falling to 907 yuan. The market recovered slightly at closing. Statistics show that 2,195 bales were traded in the first half of the day. The price of 20-count Shuangma rose by 11.5 yuan. The amount purchased by each group is listed below:</p>
<p>Same trade: 1,685 bales Hong Kong: 410 bales</p>
<p>Mainland: 50 bales Xiamen: 15 bales</p>
<p>Wenzhou: 30 bales Total: 2,195 bales</p>
<h3 id="e60">Depressed Yarn Sales Make it Difficult for Cotton Prices to Rise <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Spot cotton trading remained mediocre. Factories were not eager to purchase, mainly due to two factors: Firstly, the European war was intense, making it difficult to be optimistic about the Indian and American cotton markets. Secondly, domestic shipping routes were disrupted, and yarn sales were depressed. These two major factors prevented the cotton market from making progress. Furthermore, factories were facing severe cash shortages, and payments for purchased cotton had to be delayed by two months, so there was little change in prices.</p>
<p>In other news, foreign cotton prices: The New York cotton market initially fell due to a lack of buyers, and then due to the weakness of Wall Street and mass selling. As a result, closing prices fell by about eight basis points compared to the previous day. The Indian market was exceptionally quiet.</p>
<p>Although foreign cotton trading in Shanghai was quiet, sentiment was quite stable. As yarn prices had entered a stable state, factories had a strong interest in purchasing, but no purchases were made. Recently, arrivals have gradually decreased, which will have a significant impact on the cotton market.</p>
<h3 id="e61">Piece Goods: Obstruction of Gu'ao Head Cargo in Zhejiang Sea, Depreciation of Hand Goods <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>In the cloth market, the shipment of Gu'ao Head cargo in the Zhejiang Sea was quickly obstructed, the Wenzhou group stopped handling goods, and the floating households were timid, depreciating and selling off small amounts of hand goods. Therefore, the market price of some piece goods continued to fall by about 2.5 jiao per piece. The local street traded over 300 pieces of twill and other grey cloth, coarse cloth, bleached and dyed cloth. The Guangdong and Hong Kong groups handled over 200 pieces of twill, colored cloth, and colored twill. The North Road Yantai group handled over 100 pieces of coarse cloth and flannel.</p>
<p>Eastern cloth rose in the morning and fell in the afternoon, resulting in a flat settlement. 12-pound Longtou fine cloth was once sold at 31.23 yuan when the market opened. However, due to sluggish actual sales and traders selling at high prices, prices fell back again. The after-market low fell to 30.045 yuan, and closed at 30.065 yuan. Sijunzi serge rose to 9.125 jiao in the morning, and also fell back to 9 jiao. However, the local street dyeing and sales of medium-grade miscellaneous fine cloth and fine twill were still absorbed, so they rose by 2.5 to 5 jiao compared to the previous day.</p>
<h3 id="e62">Black Carbon Lining Floods the Market <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>There was once a shortage of black carbon lining, but since Yin Feng Xin Ji Factory produced a large quantity, the market trend reversed. Now, there are successors who ship the goods successively, including Mei Xin, Bao Xin, Ren Tai, Gong Ping, etc., resulting in a flooded market, creating a situation where supply exceeds demand. Standard prices have fallen across the board. Currently, Yin Feng 1470 first-class black carbon lining is sold wholesale at 4.15 yuan per yard, Yin Feng Xing deputy number at 3.6 yuan, Gong Ping brand at 3.9 yuan, Mei Xin three-open brand at 3.65 yuan, and Ren Tai Lion and Horse brand at 3.4 yuan. However, the market is quite short of warp and weft all-wool black carbon lining, with only Yuan Chang Xing having small quantities for retail, priced at 6.5 to 6.6 yuan. Due to the extreme shortage of white wool, factories have not produced any new products recently, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e63">Silk &amp; Tea: Slight Movement in Green Tea <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>In the past two days, the sales of green tea from foreign firms in this city have shown a slight movement. Shrimp eye pearl tea has been quite active due to the actions of the Xie He foreign firm. Wu Se Feng Mei, Jin Long Tong Fu, and other firms have also been discussing prices. However, the reason why the current market is difficult to expand is that the cost of goods for Chinese merchants this year is too high, making negotiations difficult. Yesterday, a total of over 100 boxes of pearl tea were traded, with prices ranging from 265 yuan to 300 yuan. As for Feng Mei green tea, industry insiders believe the price is between 230 and 240 yuan, but no transactions have been seen, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Metals: Sales of Flat Folded Iron are Still Good <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>The recent sales of flat folded iron have been good. This is because canneries have smooth sales, and toy factories and printing factories also make occasional purchases. Merchants along Changjiang Road also make continuous additions. The reason for its active trading is that its price is lower than that of the company's iron, but its uses are no less than those of the company's iron. Therefore, it meets the needs of various factories and customer groups, making its sales quite active. It is estimated that 300 bundles were traded in the market yesterday, so the market is not lonely and the sentiment is showing promise. The quoted price is 70 yuan per bundle (each bundle is packed with 100 pounds, and two bundles make one box), and 140 yuan per box, it is said.</p>

<p>— By Sheng Kaiqiong</p>
<p>— August 17th —</p>
<p>Measures for Managing Banks</p>
<p>The Chinese government did not have general regulatory laws for controlling banks during wartime. Even the Banking Law passed by the Legislative Yuan on February 28, 1931, did not adopt articles that stipulate the management of bank operations from a specific economic standpoint. Although the National Government promulgated and implemented the Specialized Savings Bank Law on July 4, 1934, which stipulated the proportion of bank deposits to be invested in specific enterprises and that banks should deposit 25% of the total amount of real-value deposits as government bonds or other reliable assets with the Central Bank as a guarantee for repaying savings deposits, this law did not apply to general banks. Before the war, the Ministry of Finance had drafted various regulatory banking laws, but none were established. During the war, the Ministry of Finance's efforts in economic warfare focused on controlling foreign exchange, managing trade, collecting gold and silver, and issuing public bonds. However, after three years of resistance, the war has transitioned from military operations to economic warfare, relying entirely on the power of financial policies to accomplish great tasks. How to use financial policies to facilitate the transfer of materials and the redistribution of social purchasing power, as well as the collection of construction capital and the utilization of construction funds, to meet the needs of resistance and construction, all depend on managing banking operations. Therefore, on August 7, the Ministry of Finance announced ten articles of the "Provisional Measures for Managing Banks During the Extraordinary Period," which marked the beginning of wartime banking control.</p>
<p>The management measures clearly address the bank's primary operations, such as deposits, loans, and remittances. In terms of deposits, Article 2 stipulates: "In addition to savings deposits, which should be handled in accordance with the Savings Bank Law, general deposits received by banks should have 20% of the total amount of deposits as a reserve, transferred to any one of the four banks (Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Communications Bank, and Agricultural Bank of China) in the local area, and the receiving bank should provide appropriate deposit interest." In terms of loan methods, Article 3 stipulates: "The use of bank deposits should be based on investing in production and construction enterprises and joint production and sales enterprises; mortgage loans should be limited to legitimate merchants in each industry; if the mortgagor requests an extension of the loan period upon maturity, the nature of the goods should be examined. If they are daily necessities for people's livelihoods, the mortgagor should be immediately ordered to redeem and sell the goods, and no extension should be granted to prevent hoarding." In terms of remittances, Article 5 stipulates: "Remittances to ports by banks should be limited to purchasing daily necessities and items necessary for the war of resistance." However, to prevent banks from deliberately evading and exploiting loopholes, the financial authorities also managed their ancillary businesses. Therefore, Article 4 stipulates:</p>
<p>"Banks must not directly engage in commerce or hoard goods, and must not, under the names of agency departments, trade departments, or trust departments, engage in buying and selling goods on their own or on behalf of customers."</p>
<p>The purpose of implementing these measures, in addition to what was mentioned at the end of the first section, is to clearly prohibit unscrupulous merchants from engaging in monopoly, hoarding, speculation, and manipulation using bank funds, and to seek price stabilization. The goal is clear and easy to see, and no further discussion is needed. I will briefly elaborate on other aspects.</p>
<p>(1) According to Article 2, any government bank should give interest on the reserves of general banks, so what is paid is definitely not government bonds or assets, but must be legal tender. When government banks receive these funds, they indirectly become the Central Bank and increase their power. The result can have two effects on finance: First, if government banks do not use these funds after receiving them, a large amount of legal tender will flow back into the government banks' vaults and be stored, thereby contracting the amount of legal tender in circulation. Second, if they are used, whether invested in production and construction enterprises, operated in production and sales enterprises, or used to purchase government bonds and mortgage loans, they will inevitably be transferred from government banks to the private sector, and then flow back into banks as deposits, which is certain. Then, government banks do not need to increase their liabilities—issuance—to increase their assets—loans, securities purchases. In this way, the amount of legal tender in circulation may not increase, and the function of regulating currency can be achieved in finance. (After the implementation of Article 2, government banks can receive at least 1.02 billion yuan of legal tender.) (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e66">Japanese Conspiracy to Change Defense Force Resolution; United States Expresses No Concessions; Japan Discusses So-Called Compromise Plan; Gathering of Second Meeting Unconfirmed <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Following the defense force meeting on Thursday (the 15th) where a resolution was made, the Japanese side had hinted that Rear Admiral Takeda, commander of the Japanese Marine Corps, would convene a second meeting. Yesterday, according to a certain staff member of the Defense Force Committee, the Defense Force Committee was unaware of whether Japanese Commander Takeda would convene a second meeting. However, official circles stated that the resolutions made by the defense force meeting must be approved by the governments concerned to be effective. According to official announcements made yesterday, the Italian representative attending the defense force meeting on Thursday (the 15th) was Commander Galletti.</p>
<p>United States Expresses No Further Retreat</p>
<p>A Reuters dispatch from Washington on the 17th stated that the Japanese government appeared unwilling to comply with the Shanghai Defense Committee's resolution regarding the British military's withdrawal and the takeover of the British defense zone. People here find this particularly strange. Regarding Japan's request that both areas of the British military's defense zone should be handed over to the Japanese side for management, the United States has shown no sign of retreat. Washington now seems to be awaiting Japan's future actions. If Japan does act, this action will be regarded as opposing international groups that everyone should protect but that no one is protecting. However, the general feeling is that Japan cannot take further risks in the war against China, especially while Britain's defeat is not yet certain, by directly opposing the United States represented by the Marines. One newspaper said that although officially authorized verbal thunder has repeatedly continued, Japan has only taken a small step regarding its threat to advance into Southeast Asia. Japan has shed much blood in the war against China. Although it wants to cooperate with the Axis powers, it cannot quickly and easily implement its own procedures in the way that some people imagine. Japan is not free to act. It is at war with Chairman Chiang, but still feels it is not appropriate to formally declare war on him.</p>
<p>Furthermore, There is a So-Called Compromise Plan</p>
<p>The English-language "China Press" reported that this morning (the 17th) it heard from reliable sources that the Japanese authorities may propose a compromise plan regarding the resolution reached by the Shanghai Defense Force Commanders Committee on Thursday. The plan suggests that after the British troops leave Shanghai, the area currently defended by the British troops should be abandoned, and the two areas managed by the Shanghai Municipal Council's Police Department should be re-established. For example, the area outside the boundary of the western district of Shanghai can have the police maintained by a joint police force that is expected to be established next month. The Xihongkou area can maintain normal police management. Regarding this defense zone modification proposal, officials did not offer any criticism, but some believe that the resolution reached by the Defense Force Commanders Committee may soon undergo changes. A Japanese spokesperson claimed yesterday (the 16th) at a press conference that the Defense Force Commanders have not agreed that the resolution of Thursday will be implemented. This proposal is only a plan to be submitted for discussion when the Defense Force Commanders Committee convenes another meeting.</p>
<p>Japanese Military Attempts to Overturn Decision</p>
<p>The "Continental Daily News" reported that a Japanese naval spokesperson claimed yesterday (the 16th) afternoon at a press conference that the Japanese authorities could not consider the decision reached by the Shanghai Defense Force Commanders Committee at its meeting on Thursday as the final resolution. Rear Admiral Takeda has raised objections and is expected to receive support from the Tokyo government. Any agreement that does not have the full approval of the Japanese authorities will not take effect. The reason why the Japanese side opposes this resolution is that the Public Concession is a base for political activities of the Chongqing side, and these activities seriously hinder the military operations of the Japanese army.</p>
<p>Waiting Quietly for Government Instructions from Each Country</p>
<p>The "Continental Daily News" reported that responsible officials told reporters yesterday (the 16th) that the defense force commanders of various countries who attended the Shanghai Defense Force Committee meeting on Thursday have telegraphed the resolution to their respective governments and are now quietly awaiting instructions. It is uncertain what actions the governments concerned will take regarding this resolution. However, it is widely believed that the governments will endorse the resolution agreed upon by their military representatives stationed in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Holding Meetings Again Would Be of No Avail</p>
<p>According to Japanese sources, Rear Admiral Takeda Seiji, commander of the Japanese Marine Corps in Shanghai and chairman of the Defense Force Commanders Committee, will convene another meeting of the committee. Regarding this claim, responsible parties refused to comment. It is generally believed that if the Defense Force Commanders Committee holds another meeting, it will proceed along the same lines as the meeting on Thursday, with the military representatives of the United States and Britain, the Chief of the Shanghai Municipal Council Police, and the commander of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps all voting in favor of the agreed-upon resolution, while the Japanese or Italian military representatives will all vote against it.</p>
<p>When Will the Handover Take Place? Cannot Be Predicted</p>
<p>Responsible parties could not specify the date of the handover of the new area by the U.S. and Japanese military. The date of the British military's departure from Shanghai has not yet been determined. However, it is widely believed that the handover date will be within this month. When a reporter asked a U.S. military officer about the U.S. Marine Corps stationed in Shanghai planning to increase its strength, the officer replied that he believed there was no need to increase strength at present.</p>
<h3 id="e67">Public Concession Gradual Relaxation of Alert <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>According to a reporter's inspection, the barbed wire fences set up at the Sanyangjing Bridge, Sichuan Road, Sanmaoge Bridge, Dongxin Bridge, southern end of Yuqiaqing Road, and bridges such as the Nicheng Bridge, Zhejiang Road Bridge, and Tianhou Palace Bridge in the Public Concession originally only had two openings on the left and right for pedestrians to enter and exit separately. Now, the blocked fences have been moved to the center and sides of the road, but Chinese and Western detectives are still stationed nearby to maintain law and order. The bridges at Shaanxi Road's Pintang Alley Bridge and Jiangxi Road's Waterworks Bridge, which were sealed off and cut off traffic during martial law, have now moved the barbed wire fences to the bridge abutments and restored traffic. The state of lockdown in the area outside the boundary of the western district of Shanghai has been relaxed as most of the barbed wire fences have been moved and removed, so the atmosphere is now more relaxed than before.</p>
<h3 id="e68">Large Amount of Electrical Materials from Avenue Albert Hauled Out of the Country; Japanese Consulate's Military Police Commander Otsuka Personally Loads and Unloads <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the matter of a large batch of radio materials stored at No. 69 Avenue Albert, French Concession, being hauled out of the country by the Japanese side, investigation revealed that the matter was personally directed by Otsuka, the commander of the Japanese Consulate's military police, who led more than a hundred plainclothes military police to the location after martial law was declared the previous night. They personally started loading and unloading, using a total of thirty-two trucks, and only finished hauling the materials away yesterday morning. The remaining bulky and heavy items were loaded onto trucks and transported away again last night. The exact quantity of these materials and their value are still unknown, but judging from the time spent on hauling and loading, it must be very large. According to another report, these electrical materials are said to have been stored by the Ministry of Communications of the National Government, with a total value of 20 million yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e69">Two Bloody Incidents Occurred in This City Last Night; Chen Renfu Shot and Wounded; One Teenager Shot to Death <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Two bloody incidents occurred in this city last night. The first incident occurred at 9:05 last night. A bandit attempted to extort money from Chen Renfu in front of the back door of the Children's Bookstore on Fuzhou Road. The family reported to the police station, which ordered detectives to rush to arrest him. The bandit actually opened fire to resist arrest, shooting the victim in the back. The bullet did not pass through. The detectives bravely captured the bandit on the spot and detained him at the police station for investigation. The injured person was sent to the hospital for treatment. The details of the case are complicated and will be learned later.</p>
<p>Chen Renfu Encountered Thugs</p>
<p>Chen Renfu, 46 years old, from Dinghai, Zhejiang, has been working as a clerk in the foreign accounting office of the British company Asiatic Petroleum Company at No. 1 Yangjingbang, The Bund, for 25 years. His home is at No. 9, 3rd floor, Children's Bookstore, No. 424 Fuzhou Road. He has two sons and one daughter. The eldest son, Biao Bing, is 25 years old and works at the International Hotel. The younger son, Hao, is 21 years old and studies in the senior year of Siyuan Middle School. The daughter is not yet married. His monthly income is still considerable, and the family is harmonious. The other day (the 12th), at 7:40 in the morning, Chen went to work at the company as usual. When he reached the intersection of Sichuan Road and Guangdong Road, he suddenly encountered an uninvited guest who came forward to ask him about a certain customs brokerage. Chen said that he did not know the address. Unexpectedly, the person blocked his way and said sternly,</p>
<p>Threats and Intimidation</p>
<p>Claiming, "We are from the guerrilla area in Pudong and lack military pay, please help us." At the same time, he showed a pistol to threaten and intimidate Chen, and said, "Our firearms all have licenses, and there is a car across the street with many comrades. Otherwise, we will immediately arrest you and take you to a certain place," etc. At this time, Chen was frightened by the power and stood there dumbfounded. He immediately took out 41 yuan in legal currency from his wallet as a reward. The bandit caught sight of the watch he was wearing and asked him to take it off and give it to him. He also forced Chen to tell him his address, age, salary, and place of employment. The kind-hearted Dong Juxin actually told him the truth. When leaving, he also told Chen that the watch would be sent to his residence on the evening of the 14th without fail.</p>
<p>Police Protection</p>
<p>On the morning of the 14th, at about 9:30, Chen was working at the company when he received a phone call saying that he would be visiting his residence tonight and asking him to prepare wine and dishes. Several people would come for a drink and saying that this news should not be leaked. If the police were reported, his life would not be guaranteed, etc. Hearing this, Chen quickly asked for leave from the company and returned home to report to the Central Police Station with his eldest son, Biao Bing, requesting protection. Many detectives were dispatched to be on strict guard around his residence, and a detective was assigned to follow Chen's movements to protect him. However, the man did not go to his residence at the appointed time. Last night, at 9:05, Chen and his family were chatting in the room.</p>
<p>Another Extortion Attempt</p>
<p>Yesterday was Saturday. Chen thought that there had been no accidents for two days and sent away the protective personnel dispatched by the police station. Last night, at 9:05, Chen and his family were chatting at their residence when, unexpectedly, the person who had intimidated him before suddenly appeared, wearing a suit and a white hat, and said to Chen, "I did not break my promise. I am here now," etc. After speaking, he pulled Chen's clothes and dragged him downstairs to the back entrance, showed his pistol, and extorted 100 yuan from Chen, asking him to hand it over immediately. At that time, Chen's youngest son, Chen Hao, saw his father being dragged downstairs and knew something was wrong, so he followed him out to investigate.</p>
<p>Victim Shot</p>
<p>Then, he tiptoed upstairs to describe the previous situation in detail. Chen's daughter secretly went to the Children's Bookstore to report to the police station by phone. After a while, a large number of detectives rushed to the scene and broke into the alley. The intimidator was greatly alarmed when he saw this and hid behind Chen, intending to use Chen as a cover. At this time, two gunshots were suddenly heard, and Chen was shot in the back. The detectives then captured the intimidator, and Chen was sent to Renji Hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>A Teenager Shot Dead</p>
<p>The second case occurred at 9:14 last night, just a few minutes after the first case. At this time, on the side of the road at No. 432 Lane (i.e., Sauce Garden Lane), Meibeike Road, Shanhai Pass Road, a teenager was walking alone when two people lurking there saw him approaching and immediately drew their pistols and fired two shots at him, both hitting him. The teenager immediately fell to the ground in response. One shot hit him in the abdomen and the other in the chest. Because the injuries were in vital areas, he died instantly. The shooters, seeing that their goal had been achieved, fled into the lane and disappeared without a trace. Later, someone called the police on duty, who rushed to the scene, but the murderers had already disappeared. An ambulance was urgently called to transport the body to Baolong Hospital, and the court will be requested to send someone to inspect it tomorrow morning. The deceased was over 20 years old, wearing a gray serge gown, white cloth shirt and pants, brown suede shoes, his hair combed back, and two gold teeth inlaid in his mouth.</p>
<h3 id="e70">"Xinwen Bao" Reporter Gu Zhizhong Met with Danger Yesterday; Shot in the Neck, He Ran Madly for Help to Escape; Not in a Vital Area, His Life is Out of Danger <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>At the intersection of Avenue Foch and Avenue Saipo Sai in the French Concession, a sniper incident suddenly occurred at about 2:00 p.m. yesterday. The injured person was Gu Zhizhong, the deputy director of the interviewing department of the "Xinwen Bao" newspaper. The assailant fired three shots, one of which hit Gu's right neck, and then fled across the road to Danshui Road in the Public Concession. The details are investigated and recorded below.</p>
<p>Encountered Sniper on the Way from Home to Newspaper Office</p>
<p>Gu Zhizhong, 43 years old, from Nanhui, is currently the deputy director of the interviewing department of the "Xinwen Bao" newspaper and also runs the Minzhi Journalism Training School, serving as its principal. Recently, due to environmental reasons, he moved into the newspaper office, but still goes out from time to time. Yesterday, Gu returned home from the newspaper office. At about 2:00 p.m., he intended to return to the newspaper office and was walking leisurely out of his residence on Avenue Pushi, turning north into Avenue Foch and heading east to No. 105, the Asia Motor Company, at the intersection of Avenue Saipo Sai and Avenue Foch, when suddenly a person wearing a rice-colored suit, close to 30 years old, saw Gu approaching and fired his gun at him without asking any questions, firing three shots in succession.</p>
<p>Shot in the Neck, Stating No Issues</p>
<p>One bullet hit his right neck. Gu quickly held the wound with both hands and turned south to run away, turning into Renhua Lane to temporarily hide and avoid his attack. The shooter, seeing that Gu had been shot, stepped towards Danshui Road in the Public Concession and fled. After a while, Gu peeked out and went to the southern end of Avenue Pushi, shouting "Robber!". The servant in the gatehouse of the Nanyang Hospital across the street heard the sound and helped to call for help. A Chinese policeman standing at the intersection of Avenue Joffre heard the sound and came over, and accompanied Gu to a nearby place to make a phone call and report to the Lujiiawan General Police Station. By the time Chinese and Western detectives drove over, the assailant had already disappeared. They then accompanied Gu to Nanyang Hospital. After Dr. Gu of the hospital used X-rays, it was discovered that the bullet had not penetrated and the main blood vessel had not been damaged. After bandaging, the detectives from the French Concession Police Department transferred Gu to Guangci Hospital for treatment. At 4:00 p.m., the hospital performed surgery to remove the bullet. The process was good, and his life is definitely out of danger.</p>
<h3 id="e71">British Troops Leaving Shanghai Will Hold a Review Tomorrow; Farewell Review Ceremony to Be Held in the Grounds of the Racecourse Entertainment Venue <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>The date of the British military's withdrawal from Shanghai is not far off. Therefore, the British military authorities, in order to bid farewell to all sectors of society, have scheduled a farewell review ceremony for 6:30 p.m. on the 19th of this month (i.e., tomorrow) in the grounds of the amusement park at the Racecourse on Avenue Haig. At that time, the Seaforth Highlanders, the East Yorkshire Regiment, and other units of the British military in Shanghai will be reviewed in full force. British military commanders Major General Simmons, Major General Auchinleck, Seaforth Highlanders commander Major Murray, and East Yorkshire Regiment commander Major Swinton will all attend in full dress. British officials in Shanghai will also be invited to attend. It is heard that the defense force commanders and diplomatic officials of various countries stationed in Shanghai have also been invited by the British military headquarters. Tomorrow's situation will be exciting and will be the only one seen in Shanghai.</p>
<p>British Military Broadcasts Farewell to All Sectors</p>
<p>Major General Simmons, the commander of the British Army stationed in Shanghai, took office in May of last year. During this period, it coincided with the time of many events, and it was not easy to cope with the internationalized Shanghai. The defense of the Public Concession was naturally arduous. As the British military is about to withdraw from Shanghai, Major General Simmons broadcasted a speech on the ZI-S Times radio station at 8:00 p.m. yesterday to bid farewell to all sectors of society in Shanghai. Major General Simmons's words were even more moving, stating that the British military has been stationed in Shanghai for nearly twelve years and has been able to win the praise of all sectors of society during these twelve years. But now, due to urgent military orders, it will soon be on its way to bid farewell to Shanghai's friends. This departure will separate it from the Shanghai area by a greater distance. This kind of action is originally a military transfer and there is nothing surprising about it. But at present, he himself has received letters from all sectors of society, expressing their feelings of friendship, which makes him even more ashamed.</p>
<p>British Overseas Chinese Association Sends慰問品</p>
<p>The British Overseas Chinese Association, the British Wartime Fundraising Association, and the British authorities in Shanghai, feeling sorry for the British troops stationed in Shanghai who are about to withdraw from Shanghai and serve their motherland, have already collected a large amount of money and military necessities as gifts and sent them to the British military headquarters on Avenue Dufour, requesting that they be forwarded to the departing British soldiers. British military commander Major General Auchinleck expressed sincere thanks for the comfort items from all sectors of society.</p>

<p>Since the establishment of the Pétain government and the implementation of the armistice with Germany and Italy, former French National Defense Minister General de Gaulle immediately organized volunteer troops in London, established a provisional government, and was recognized by the British government, competing with the Vichy government. However, except for a few colonies such as the New Hebrides Islands, most territories of authorities in France and abroad have expressed their sincerity in supporting Pétain. In order to unify the will of French overseas Chinese in China, French Ambassador Cosme specially issued a circular the day before yesterday (16th), strictly prohibiting French officials in China from violating government orders and engaging in divisive movements or propaganda. The original text is recorded below and translated as follows:</p>
<p>French People Cannot Tolerate Duplicity</p>
<p>French people all have the freedom to have their own political likes and dislikes, but they cannot tolerate duplicity to the government. France currently has only one legitimate government, and its authority is still granted by the National Assembly as stipulated in the Constitution of 1875. Our country has now laid down its weapons. Verbal debates are of no help to the matter and are harmful to the country. I hope my French overseas Chinese in China will avoid them and implement unity, everyone loving and restraining themselves.</p>
<p>Promulgation of Laws; Prohibition of Anti-Propaganda</p>
<p>The tasks of all levels of French officials in French concessions in China have been clearly stipulated in Article 1 of the Decree promulgated on April 9, 1940. The original text is recorded again below: "During wartime, officials at all levels of administrative agencies, public service agencies, local agencies, and overseas colonial agencies who engage in propaganda for dissolved political parties in their duties or outside their duties, or propaganda that is detrimental to national defense, shall be immediately dismissed by the主管長官.” In order to implement the above regulations, this ambassador has specified two regulations, hoping that they will be followed in their entirety.</p>
<p>Article 1: French officials or foreign officials in the French Concession Public Works Bureau, all police stations, and other French agencies who take actions that endanger or attempt to endanger national defense interests, or who incite the unity of the people, damage the dignity of the government, or violate government orders shall be dismissed immediately.</p>
<p>Article 2: The consuls general and consuls in Shanghai, Tianjin, Hankou, Guangzhou, etc. are responsible for supervising the implementation of this order. August 16, 1940, Cosme.</p>
<h3 id="e74">British Ambassador Scheduled to Go to Chongqing <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>British Ambassador to China Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, after arriving in Shanghai from Chongqing on June 15, cancelled his plan to go to Beidaihe to escape the summer this year due to the sudden tension in the Far East situation and his busy official duties. He only went to Weihaiwei for a week's trip on June 30. According to Pingming News Agency reporters' inquiries with authoritative sources among British overseas Chinese in Shanghai, the British Ambassador has tentatively scheduled to leave Shanghai for Chongqing around the 25th of this month. The reason why Sir Archibald Clark Kerr is suddenly advancing the date of his trip to Chongqing is that some important official duties that the ambassador must handle in Shanghai have come to an end, and the aftermath of the British defense force's withdrawal from Shanghai is generally free of major changes. There is no need to stay here any longer. The ambassador's main mission is that the British government has a special relationship with the Chinese government in the Far East situation, so after the ambassador arrives in Chongqing, he will visit the central authorities and the friendly cooperation between China and Britain in the future will become stronger.</p>
<h3 id="e75">"Moufuku" Ship Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Afternoon; Plans to Sail to Gu'ao Again; Still Under Negotiation <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>The German merchant ship "Moufuku" of the Laihe 洋行 set sail for Gu'ao Head on the morning of the 13th and arrived outside the Aojiang Estuary late in the evening. It was immediately inspected by a Japanese warship and prevented from entering the port. Although the German shipmaster negotiated, the two sides remained in a stalemate until 6:00 a.m. on the 16th and the ship was still not allowed to enter the port. The ship had to return to Shanghai and arrived at Roosevelt Wharf at noon yesterday. The ship carried more than 200 merchants with goods, and more than 100 of them have already landed. There are still 36 people staying on the ship, and the goods have not been unloaded. The shipowner is still in negotiation. If the negotiation goes smoothly, the ship will still sail. It is noted that Gu'ao Head is not within the ports announced by the Japanese side as being blockaded. The customs also normally handles customs clearance, so there is no reason to obstruct it.</p>
<p>"Maberia"</p>
<p>The Italian merchant ship "Maberia" (transliteration) still sailed from Shanghai to Aojiang as usual the day before yesterday. There is still no news about it at this time. It is noted that the ship is very small and carries only goods, so it may be able to enter the port like the Changde example. After the Xin'an 通 ship finished unloading, it will sail to the buoy to moor. The Hana ship has also been moved to the Pujiang buoy to moor and is waiting for news.</p>
<p>French Mail "Xijiang"</p>
<p>The French postal company's postal ship "Xijiang" was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai from Japan on the 16th of this month. According to company news yesterday, the ship was delayed until yesterday to start the anchor and come to Shanghai because it had not finished loading in Kobe, Japan. It should arrive in port on the 20th and sail directly from Shanghai to Haiphong on the 22nd. The company's "Jindi" ship is currently still滞留 in Haiphong. According to news from the British company Fuxing, although Xinghua Bay, the only 通口 of foreign ships in Jian province, is being strictly blockaded by the Japanese, the company is still trying to open up a new route because it is a matter of great business. The location is unknown. Although the customs has not allowed customs clearance, carrying passengers is not a problem, so the company's Xin'an納 ship may carry passengers to Fujian within days.</p>
<h3 id="e76">Hu Xiyuan Suddenly Reported Missing, Rumor Says He Received a Letter Beforehand, and Disappeared Within a Few Days <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Hu Xiyuan, the 43-year-old general manager of the Huashang Yabu'er Electrical Factory at 492 Beijing Road and a native of Zhenhai, suddenly went missing on the morning of the 11th of this month. His relatives and friends in Shanghai have been searching for him everywhere, but there is no news of his whereabouts. Even the people in the factory do not know where he has gone. According to a reporter from Pingming News Agency who inquired with relevant parties yesterday, Hu founded the Yabu'er Electrical Factory in the 14th year of the Republic of China. He devoted all his energy to it, and the business seemed to be very prosperous. In September of the 26th year of the Republic of China, Hu took his family from Shanghai to Hankou, intending to develop the factory's business. However, when Wuhan fell, Hu went to Chongqing to take refuge. It was not until mid-July of this year that he came to Shanghai alone to inspect the current business situation of the Shanghai factory. After arriving in Shanghai, he worked hard to manage the factory's affairs, and personally went to the factory to work every two or three days. On the 7th of this month, he suddenly received a strange letter, which he dismissed with a laugh at the time. Who knew that from the 11th onwards, Hu disappeared without a trace. His relatives and friends in Shanghai were all anxious about this, as they had not received any news of him leaving Shanghai beforehand.</p>
<h3 id="e77">Full Payment, No Installment Remittances, No Installment Payments and Remittances <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance issued 500 million yuan of national currency for national salvation bonds on September 1, 1937. The third interest payment for the bonds, totaling 20 million yuan, has been allocated by the Ministry of Finance from the national treasury revenue and deposited in a special account at the head office of the Central Bank for payment. As for the payment method, the Central Bank and its entrusted Bank of China and Bank of Communications will make full payments without installment payments or remittances. The Shanghai branches of the three banks (Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications) in the Shanghai concession area will not handle payment matters. In Hong Kong, the Bank of China and Bank of Communications in Hong Kong are entrusted to make payments. Therefore, ticket holders in Shanghai can entrust various banks to collect from the Bank of China and Bank of Communications in Hong Kong. It is also heard that the bond has been scheduled to start repaying the principal next year, with principal and interest being repaid in full over 30 years. Principal and interest will be repaid once a year at the end of August through a lottery. As for the third interest payment, payments will begin on the 31st of this month.</p>

<p>The Shaoxing Seven Counties Fellow Association in Shanghai's Committee for Stabilized Grain Prices held a distribution committee meeting at the Zhongyi Trust Company at 3:00 PM yesterday. Pei Yunqing served as chairman. The chairman first gave an opening speech, followed by Huang Yuzhai, the director of general affairs of the association, who reported on the progress of the variety show and the amount of ticket sales. Then, discussions began on how to allocate the more than 50,000 yuan in ticket sales from the four-day variety show and the 600,000 yuan in donations voluntarily recognized by various industries. As a result of the discussion, it was decided that 450,000 yuan would be allocated to Shaoxing and Xiaoshan counties to handle stabilized grain prices, provide porridge, and provide emergency relief, while the remaining 250,000 yuan would be allocated to the remaining five counties as funds for handling stabilized grain prices. The association immediately sent letters to various industry associations that had recognized donations, stating that if they agreed to the above allocation method, it would be handled accordingly. Otherwise, they should respond with their individual opinions within three days of receiving the letter. It was also learned that the Ningbo Fellow Association in Shanghai had previously remitted 20,000 yuan to provide disaster relief to the people of Zhenhai. The remittance has now arrived in Zhenhai yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e79">Japanese Aircraft and Warships Harass Eastern Zhejiang Again, Indiscriminately Carry Out Blind Bombing, Twelve Bombs Fell on Xikou, Minimal Local Damage, Japanese Warships Fired More Than Thirty Shells at Haimen <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>According to reliable sources in the aviation industry, Japanese aircraft again flew to Fenghua Xikou on the morning of the 16th and wreaked havoc, dropping twelve bombs. Haimen was bombed by Japanese warships, with details of the damage unknown. The Datong News Agency reporter now records the situation as follows:</p>
<p>Bombing of Xikou</p>
<p>At 7:52 AM on the morning of the 16th, two Japanese aircraft were spotted over Longshan Mountain in Zhenhai. The aircraft then passed through Zhenhai and Ningbo before invading the airspace over Fenghua Xikou. Twelve bombs were dropped on Xikou. Three bombs landed in a certain place, destroying six houses. One coolie was injured at the Xikou bus station. A wall of the Xikou police station was destroyed. Two bombs landed at a certain auto repair shop, killing a child by crushing a tire. One bomb landed in Weijiazhuang. Two bombs landed on the sandy ground. One bomb landed near Yangqiao Bridge but missed. One bomb was also dropped on Xi Huifan. At 8:18 AM, the aircraft turned and flew out to sea via Ningbo, Cixi, and Guanhaiwei.</p>
<p>Shelling of Haimen</p>
<p>At 7:50 AM on the morning of the 16th, a large Japanese warship was spotted on the Yueqing waters. Aircraft models could be vaguely seen on board, suggesting it was an aircraft carrier. At 8:10 AM, six Japanese warships were spotted on the Haimen Qingyang Port waters. They suddenly fired more than thirty shells indiscriminately at the shore, but the shells all landed in the mud, causing no damage to us. They are currently still docked in the waters and have not moved. At 9:29 AM, a Japanese warship sailed from the north to Haidou and also fired five shells without a target at the shore. It is still docked there and has not moved.</p>
<h3 id="e80">Zhang Xiaolin Assassination Case, Interrogation Record of the Culprit Lin Huaibu, Bodyguard Claims to Be the Son of a General and Unwilling to Suffer Humiliation, Chauffeur Has Considerable Influence and Is a Prominent Figure in the Zhang Residence, The Murderer's Father Had a Historical Relationship with Zhang <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Xiaolin, a well-known figure in Shanghai, and his disciple Wu Jianchen were shot and killed by Zhang's bodyguard Lin Huaibu at 1:50 PM on the 14th of this month. After the incident, the French Concession Police sent officers to the scene, arrested the murderer on the spot, along with a pistol, and brought them to the police station. The details have already been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, the police transferred the murderer Lin Huaibu to the Special No. 2 Court. Judge Liao presided over the trial in the Criminal Division No. 1. The defendant Lin Huaibu was at ease, with bright eyes. He was wearing a sweat shirt, Xiangyun gauze pants, and leather shoes.</p>
<p>Investigation Not Completed</p>
<p>First, Gu Shouxi, the lawyer of the police station, stated that the defendant in this case was arrested for assassination, and the investigation was not completed. He requested an extension of two weeks. Then, Zhang Dongcheng, the investigating officer in charge of the case, reported on the progress of the case, adding that there were two important witnesses in the case. One was the chauffeur Wang Wenliang, also known as A Si (45 years old, from Nanjing), who had a disagreement with the defendant before the incident and was also the defendant's godfather and recommender. The other was the nanny Zhao A Jin (42 years old, from Suzhou). When the victim was shot, the nanny happened to be standing nearby. Both witnesses have arrived in court today, and they requested to be summoned to determine whether there was any connection. After questioning, the police station will need to take the two witnesses for further investigation.</p>
<p>Chauffeur's Testimony</p>
<p>After the court verified the information, it immediately questioned the witness Wang Wenliang, who testified that he worked as a full-time chauffeur for Xiong Dao, the commander of the Wusong Defense Command under the 10th Army Division, in the 8th year of the Republic of China. At that time, the defendant's father was the commander of the 39th Regiment of the 20th Brigade of the 10th Army Division. After the Qi-Lu War, he entered Mr. Zhang's employment (referring to the victim) through the introduction of Guo Haishan. Later, in the 16th year of the Republic of China, Mr. Zhang happened to visit the Shenglili No. 1 Club and heard someone mention that a new prostitute from the north had arrived across the street from the club, and that her father had served as the commander of the 39th Regiment, etc. At that time, Mr. Zhang felt compassion and sent him and Cao Anchang, a former detective of the French Concession Police, to investigate.</p>
<p>Redeeming a Prostitute</p>
<p>As a result, Zhang spent 300 yuan to redeem her and summoned her birth mother to Shanghai, giving her 200 yuan for travel expenses. Unexpectedly, the mother and daughter did not leave Shanghai after receiving the money and instead opened a hotel in Nanshi. Later, due to the prosperity of the business, they opened another store. Until the 24th year of the Republic of China, the defendant suddenly came to visit him with a picture of his deceased father, requesting a separation of the family with his mother. He then mediated the matter and received 50 yuan. Later, when Mr. Zhang celebrated his 60th birthday, with a banquet held at the Great Shanghai Garden, the defendant and his maternal uncle jointly sent two bands of military musicians. Mr. Zhang, seeing this in the birthday hall, was complacent, thinking that a good deed would be rewarded.</p>
<p>Recognizing a Godfather</p>
<p>At that time, the defendant was still working as a police officer in the police station. Before long, he was suddenly dismissed for some reason and repeatedly came to him requesting assistance. In the spring of last year, his wife celebrated her 30th birthday, and the defendant also came to offer birthday wishes, sending large gifts, and recognizing him as his godfather on the spot. Later, after the defendant's repeated requests, he accompanied him to see Mr. Zhang. After entering, he was initially only assigned to guard the second gate and was not allowed to carry a gun. It was not until June of this year that a bodyguard resigned for some reason. The defendant learned of this and wrote a letter to Mr. Zhang, claiming to have excellent shooting skills and also asked Lu Xiaojia, the son of the former Zhejiang Governor Lu Yongxiang, to speak on his behalf, and he was finally hired as a bodyguard.</p>
<p>What Happened</p>
<p>A few days before the incident, the defendant suddenly changed his behavior. Because a rice merchant named Fu Zhengyan, who was a friend of the boss, was also insulted by the defendant. When the incident occurred, the defendant insisted on asking him for leave, but he did not have the authority to grant it and instructed him to ask the boss. However, the defendant ignored him and even wanted to use force. He then went upstairs to report it. At that time, Mr. Zhang was planning to have lunch when he heard the argument and leaned out the window, reprimanding the defendant slightly. Unexpectedly, the defendant became angry out of shame and suddenly had a wicked thought, pulling out his pistol and firing two shots at the boss. Seeing this, he dodged elsewhere, fortunately avoiding being affected. He did not know what happened after that. Then, the witness Zhao A Yu testified that she was a rural woman and was frightened after the incident. She did not know any of the details.</p>
<p>Murderer's Testimony</p>
<p>Questioned, the defendant Lin Huaibu testified that he was 26 years old, from Shandong, and lived at 28 Huizhan Street, Xujiahui Town. He had served as a police officer in both the British and French concessions. He entered the Zhang residence on April 15th of the previous lunar year. He claimed that Wang Wenliang's testimony was completely fabricated. The prostitute that Zhang had rescued was a maid in his family, not his sister, who had never come to Shanghai. How could the daughters of generals end up in prostitution? Last year, Wang tried his best to win him over, recognizing him as his godfather because he was the son of a general. Later, because his father had helped the Zhang family to establish their business when he was serving in the 10th Division, he had a considerable history.</p>
<p>Despicable Task</p>
<p>Therefore, he asked Wang to brag to the deceased on his behalf, giving him a suitable position. As a result, he only got a despicable task, and resentment grew in his heart. On the day of the incident, he was suffering from a severe fever and chills. Because Wang was a prominent figure in the mansion, known as the Fourth Boss, he had to obtain his consent to ask for leave. However, Wang deliberately made things difficult, so an argument occurred. The deceased reprimanded him without asking why, blaming him for being ungrateful. He replied that the price of rice was only 15 yuan when he came, but now the price of rice was 70 yuan per dan, which was not the same. The deceased was furious upon hearing this and ordered him to hand over his gun.</p>
<p>Resentment in My Heart</p>
<p>He thought it was better to break the law than to starve to death, so he aimed and fired one shot. He wanted to look for A Si, but A Si had already run away. A person named Wu was on the phone, and he threw away the telephone receiver, intending to grab him. At this time, he was in a crazy state, so he disregarded everything and fired all seven bullets in the chamber, intending to break out of the door. As a result, he was still arrested. The court verified the information and ordered the defendant to be detained and re-examined on the 31st of this month.</p>
<p>Wu and Wang Join Forces</p>
<p>Furthermore, Wu Jianchen (i.e., Wu Hong), a disciple of Zhang Xiaolin, used to live in Hangzhou, and the relationship between teacher and student was very close. After Shanghai fell, Wu often went to Hongkou, and Zhang became estranged from Wu. Therefore, Wu and Zhang's chauffeur Wang Wenliang became sworn brothers, intending to use Wang to smooth things over with Zhang. The relationship between Wu and Wang became increasingly close. Wu was originally a poor man but now has assets of tens of thousands, so Wang was also willing to associate with Wu. At about 1:00 PM on the 14th of this month, Wang called Wu from the Zhang residence to the Yangzi Hotel, saying that if he wanted to see Zhang, he should come quickly. Upon receiving the news, Wu arrived at the Zhang residence at 1:30 PM to see Zhang. Zhang happened to be downstairs. Because the teacher and student were already face to face, it was inconvenient for Zhang to refuse to see him, so they went upstairs together to talk.</p>
<p>Prominent Figure in the Zhang Residence</p>
<p>Then, Wang had a quarrel with the bodyguard Lin Huaibu in the downstairs parlor. Because Wang was an old chauffeur and most of the servants in the family were recommended by Wang, Zhang had to give Wang face and scolded the bodyguard a few times. After a few minutes of silence, Wang and Lin started arguing again. Zhang heard Wang and Lin arguing upstairs, so he stretched out his head and ordered Lin to hand over his gun. Lin immediately pulled out his gun and shot Zhang. The bullet entered Zhang's right temple and exited his left skull. At that time, although there were still six bodyguards in the Zhang residence, most of them mistakenly thought that Lin was shooting at his foster grandfather Wang A Si. Not only did they not care, but they also rejoiced.</p>
<p>Investigating the Chauffeur</p>
<p>When Wang Wenliang was leaving in the car, he ran to the corpse of Wu Jianchen, took Wu's leather bag, and gave it to his wife. At about 9:00 AM yesterday, Wu's wife and concubines went to the Zhang residence to inquire about the circumstances of her husband's murder from Zhang Fayaio, asking Zhang to investigate Wang Wenliang and avenge her husband. Based on the above circumstances, Zhang Fayaio reported to the French Concession Police yesterday, requesting a thorough investigation of Wang Wenliang's role in the incident.</p>

<p>Since Qian Hongye, the criminal court judge of the Shanghai First Special District Court, was assassinated and made a glorious sacrifice, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and others have sent condolence messages. Qian's family has scheduled the funeral for 3:15 PM yesterday, respectfully escorting the coffins of Mr. Qian and his wife, Mrs. Xu, from the Central Funeral Home, to be buried in Jing'an Cemetery at 4:30 PM.

Two bands of more than a hundred people from the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association's Orphanage and the Pingjiang Guild's Poor Children's Orphanage participated in the funeral procession, holding funeral streamers and a white horse-drawn hearse, making it a moment of great sorrow and honor.</p>
<h3 id="e82">Western Inspector of the Police Department Shoots a Dog, Facts in the Newspaper Report Do Not Match, Police Authorities Continue to Investigate <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>According to the English-language Da Mei Wan Bao, the "Xin Shen Bao," a Chinese-language newspaper of the Japanese side, reported today (the 17th) that Williamson, an inspector of the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department, "fired eight shots" at the private residence of Dr. Hamano, a Japanese doctor on Putuo Road. Police sources pointed out that this was not consistent with the facts. It was heard that at 11:00 PM on August 14th, several stray dogs suddenly came to Williamson's residence on Putuo Road (adjacent to Dr. Hamano's private residence), disturbing women and children. Williamson took out a police-issued 11.1 hunting rifle, informed his neighbors, and shot and killed two stray dogs in the corridor. The police authorities have denied the "Xin Shen Bao's" claim that Williamson fired eight shots at the Japanese doctor's private residence. However, they will continue to investigate the matter.</p>
<h3 id="e83">Water Cutoff Implemented in Chengxing Lane, Tenants Beg on the Ground to Be Exempted <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>More than 200 tenant families in Chengxing Lane on Maibaique Road were notified by Xiangchu Property Company to pay 50 yuan per building for the water meter deposit and 20 yuan per building for the water fee deposit before August 15th, otherwise the water would be cut off. After repeated negotiations by the tenants, the order was not rescinded. Yesterday was the deadline. Xiangchu Property Company sent workers to cut off the water. All the tenants came out to stop them. Some of the women of the households even knelt on the ground begging to be exempted, fortunately no incident occurred. As a result of the final negotiation, an extension of one week was granted, with no further extensions to be allowed. The tenants held an emergency meeting yesterday afternoon to deal with the situation. They believed that the water fee was already included in the rent and that it was difficult to bear the cost of forced water meter replacement at a time when everything was expensive and life was difficult. They resolved (1) to prepare a document next week and petition the Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Shanghai Municipal Council and the United Association of Citizens of the First Special District, requesting that they convey their request to the property owner to exempt them from the water meter replacement; (2) to send representatives to Xiangchu Property Company again to request that they consider the difficult times and rescind the order; and (3) for all the residents of the lane to unite and persevere to the end.</p>

The Shanghai Postal Administration has telegraphed the postal bureaus along the route, inquiring at each station. A detailed report on the transportation situation is expected within days. Mail from Fujian Province has also been disrupted due to the blockade of various ports in the Fujian Sea. According to a Datong News Agency reporter who inquired with the transportation section of the post office, the authorities are studying a new route, which will generally reroute via Xiamen, and then be transported to various places by civilian ships. The post office, as a public service, should not be hindered and should be able to deliver mail smoothly.</p>

<h3 id="e91">American Gold Problem <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>America is now caught in a storm of controversy regarding the gold problem. In the first three months of this year, gold imports into the United States totaled $900,000,000, nearly equivalent to the world's annual production. In June, gold shipments from Britain, France, the Netherlands, and Belgium to New York reached a staggering $287,000,000 in a single day. It is estimated that by the end of this year, foreign gold inflows into the United States will reach at least $21,000,000,000, accounting for over 70% of the world's total gold bars. If gold continues to flow into the United States at this rate, all the world's gold bars will completely belong to the U.S. government within three years.</p>
<p>This one-sided flow of such a vast amount of gold is truly an unprecedented development in modern economic history. It is worth remembering that seven years ago, during the banking crisis in the United States in March 1933 when President Roosevelt initiated the New Deal, both the U.S. Treasury Department and the banking sector were concerned about extracting $1 billion in gold, and U.S. finances were unable to cope. In the summer of the same year, at the World Economic Conference in London, most economists unanimously acknowledged that the American economic panic and insufficient gold were major contributing factors. Today, the excessive amount of gold is again considered by these economists to be the primary reason for the continued economic stagnation in the United States.</p>
<p>The U.S. gold storage facility is located in the mountains of Kentucky, meticulously built to be as impregnable as a fortress. In terms of physical security, it is far more difficult to access than the gold mines of South Africa. Economically, the U.S. Treasury Department is diligently studying ways to ensure that such gold reserves do not disrupt the U.S. economy.</p>
<p>Gold is a kind of bargaining chip, and such concentration in one country is indeed dangerous, which is evident even to those who are not experts in monetary economics. However, some people deeply fear that once all the world's gold belongs entirely to the United States, other countries will abolish the use of gold coins, as announced by the German Minister of Economic Affairs, Funk. In that case, wouldn't the gold purchased by the United States for $30 billion become worthless? This is also a superficial view.</p>
<p>However, it is indeed possible that after all the world's gold bars flow into the United States, gold will no longer be a bargaining chip. However, this situation does not mean that countries outside the United States will no longer need gold. On the contrary, the need for gold will definitely be even greater, and it will be regarded as having even more value for storage. Moreover, European countries have a much greater stake in maintaining gold as a bargaining chip than the United States. Once the war ends, European countries will need funds for reconstruction in every aspect. Borrowing gold from the United States will naturally be the most convenient option at that time. The most decisive factor is the even greater demand for U.S. dollars from various countries. Today, the United States is the only major power that does not need to rely on other countries, yet other countries have a strong demand for it. The U.S. trade surplus is very large, so the U.S. exchange rate is also in a favorable position. The longer the European war lasts, the more obvious this situation becomes. This position is not due to the United States possessing a large amount of gold. What others need is not American gold but U.S. dollars; but to obtain U.S. dollars, they can only sell gold to the U.S. Treasury Department. If the U.S. Treasury Department continues to exchange U.S. dollars for gold, then the demand for gold from outside will not only increase but not decrease, and the rise and fall of gold's value will be entirely controlled by the U.S. Treasury Department, which foreign countries cannot influence at all.</p>
<p>Where does the real crisis lie? First, a large amount of gold lying idle is enough to cause inflation in the United States, but judging from the current situation in the United States, this crisis is still too early to talk about. The most pressing crisis lies in affecting the international economy; in American farmers losing their last remaining markets in Europe; in destroying the remnants of international free trade, thereby helping the barter system promoted by Germany and Italy; and in destroying the free flow of international capital, thereby promoting the exchange control policies implemented by dictatorial countries.</p>
<p>Therefore, the crisis of the gold problem does not lie in the United States losing a large amount of heavy metal, but in the U.S. domestic and international economies being affected by it.</p>
<p>The international flow of gold was prompted by the unstable situation in Eastern and Central Europe after the European war. Initially, the gold reserves of Budapest, Poland, Germany, and Austria were transported to Zurich, Amsterdam, and Paris. Later, when Hitler took charge of the German regime, the whole of Europe was in turmoil, and London became the safe haven of Europe for three years. Since 1937, the changes in the social, political, and economic situation in Europe have become increasingly precarious, and European gold began to flow into the United States. Until the outbreak of this European war, the flight of gold to the United States has become like a torrential flood. Based on this, the solution to the American gold problem is the restoration of peace and stability in European society and politics, which is a prerequisite.

<h3 id="e92">The Origin of the World's Gold Concentrating in the United States <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>The U.S. government currently holds a huge amount of gold, worth more than $19,000,000,000, of which less than one-third is buried in Fort Knox, Kentucky, and the rest is mostly stored in various mints. This national gold reserve weighs about 543,000,000 ounces, accounting for about two-thirds of the total gold bars held by the governments of more than fifty countries worldwide, which can be said to have created a new record.</p>
<p>In addition, the Soviet Union also has some gold reserves, but it has not disclosed how much. No one knows how many gold coins and bars are held by individuals around the world. According to estimates by the League of Nations several years ago, privately held gold was worth $2,225,000,000, and there are also many gold rings, bracelets, necklaces, and watch ornaments, which of course cannot be calculated.</p>
<p>The gold bars held by various countries, together with the goldware held by individuals, must account for the majority of the gold that mankind has mined since ancient times. Gold is the first metal discovered by mankind. Its texture is firm and indestructible. Since ancient times, it has been highly valued by mankind. The cautious have stored it in safe places to avoid being seized by thieves or rulers. Even today, there must still be many small amounts of gold hidden around the world.</p>
<p>There are many reasons why gold has long been a durable currency in organized human society. One is that gold has indestructibility and a lasting attraction to mankind, which makes gold have "hoarding value," a value that is consistent from ancient times to the present.</p>
<p>The world's gold reserves have accumulated over thousands of years. The annual increase in gold is now greater than at any time in history, with global gold mines producing more than $1,250,000,000 per year. The reason for the increase in production is that governments and individuals in various countries have an increasing demand for gold in the past decade. Some new Keynesian economists advocate the deceptive theory that gold is "worthless." If that were the case, then it would be difficult to explain why there is more demand than supply for gold.</p>
<p>The U.S. government currently owns $19,000,000,000 in gold. In terms of both quantity and value, its amount is far greater than the gold owned by any country in history, which can be said to be unparalleled in history. The gold stored in the United States has actually increased in the past short six years. Six years ago, the gold bars owned by the U.S. government were less than 40% of the world's total. At that time, the United States accounted for 40% of the world's total trade, so the above amount of gold reserves was not abnormal. For the past twenty years, the U.S. gold reserves have often fluctuated around the above ratio. As of now, the gold reserves have reached 66% and are still increasing.</p>
<p>This historically unique situation must have been caused by extraordinary circumstances. As for what the circumstances are, economists' opinions are also very divided. In the past six years, the United States' trade has often been in a surplus position. This surplus has been around for a long time. This trade surplus could have been deposited in foreign banks or invested in foreign stocks and businesses. However, because American businessmen and banks are skeptical about the financial responsibilities of many foreign governments, they are mostly unwilling to leave the surplus overseas. The safer approach is to exchange the surplus for gold.</p>
<p>Some may ask why this surplus is not used to purchase other goods. It should be noted that the so-called surplus is only the amount by which U.S. exports exceed imports in value. This means that the United States has already absorbed various foreign goods during this period. If American importers import more foreign goods, they will be unable to sell them, and even if they can sell them, they will not be profitable.</p>
<p>So, since the surplus cannot be disposed of by lending or exchanging it for other forms of wealth, why is exchanging it for gold the only way? The answer is that gold is currently the only internationally accepted bargaining chip. The so-called "currency" is originally freely circulated among the people of various countries. Once it leaves the country's borders, others rarely accept it, or even reject it. On the contrary, all countries immediately accept gold, and there is no limit to its quantity. This situation has been around for a long time, with few exceptions. No merchant, bank, or government in the world has refused to accept gold in exchange for goods. Holding gold can immediately exchange for various items around the world. Therefore, economists call gold "the most liquid wealth."</p>
<p>The first main reason for the inflow of gold into the United States is similar to the above reason. For the past six years, depositing money in American banks has been considered the safest. Foreign banks, businesses, wealthy people, and even foreign governments are willing to deposit money in American banks rather than in their own banks. Furthermore, some people in other countries have doubts about the purchasing power of bank deposits, so they exchange them for gold and send it to the United States for deposit, which shows that the amount is even greater.</p>
<p>The reasons why the total amount of gold stored in the United States has surged from 40% to 66% in the past six years are as described above. However, what is the reason why this batch of gold is solely owned by the U.S. government? This reason is completely different from the previous two reasons. Originally, the U.S. Congress passed a law in 1932 stipulating that private individuals may not collect gold except for gold ornaments and utensils. The U.S. government has ordered that only the federal government can collect gold within the United States. No individuals, banks, or local and municipal finance bureaus may collect gold. Except for those used for industrial and commercial purposes, but they are subject to strict control. This decree is the main reason why the extraordinary circumstances have prompted the U.S. government to hoard a huge amount of gold.</p>
<p>This law can be called the Gold Nationalization Act, which is another special phenomenon regarding gold in American history. Before the independence of the United States during the colonial era, or after the establishment of the Federation, it was never illegal for individuals and banks to collect the country's legal currency, namely gold. If the drafters of the U.S. Constitution knew about this law, they would regard it as madness. At that time, someone suggested authorizing the federal government to issue paper money, but it was rejected. Because what everyone trusted at that time was only hard currency.</p>
<p>During the American Civil War, the situation was extremely precarious. The main difficulties for President Lincoln and Congress, in addition to military affairs, were dealing with the gold problem, but they never dreamed of prohibiting private collection of gold. During the previous World War, President Wilson and Congress never intended to prohibit people from collecting gold. Apart from wartime, the United States has experienced no fewer than thirty-four economic depressions and countless banking crises, with hundreds of small banks failing. However, during each economic and banking crisis, it has never been considered illegal for private individuals or banks to collect gold. Therefore, the current Gold Nationalization Act is still a pioneering initiative in American history. The reason for this is the major banking crisis in the United States in 1933.</p>
<p>The current Gold Nationalization Act does not stipulate the exact composition of the gold dollar, and its value is also subject to temporary regulations by the President. On January 31, 1934, President Roosevelt announced that the provisional composition of the gold dollar was one thirty-fifth of an ounce of pure gold. The President still has the power to change this composition at any time.</p>
<p>The paper money issued by the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank is about $5,000,000,000. If these paper currencies are exchanged for gold dollars, the U.S. Treasury Department must issue about 143,000,000 ounces of pure gold. As for the various currencies and subsidiary coins in the United States, the total amount is $7,500,000,000. If they are exchanged for cash, it will be about 24,000,000 ounces. If it is people from other countries who request to exchange for cash, the U.S. Treasury Department will allocate cash after verifying that it is true. However, American people are absolutely unable to exchange for gold due to the restrictions of the Gold Nationalization Act.</p>
<p>When the U.S. government nationalized gold in 1933 and 1934, it did not confiscate it but issued "gold certificates" guaranteeing future repayment. At that time, most of the gold was in the top two Federal Reserve Banks in the United States, and the rest was stored in other banks. The amount of gold handed over by the public was calculated at $20.67 per ounce, worth about $4,000,000,000. The President also announced that the composition of the gold dollar was reduced by 40% compared to before, so the gold received by the Treasury Department was worth $6,800,000,000. The difference between the two amounts, $2,800,000,000, is called the government's "surplus," most of which has been allocated to the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund.</p>

<p>Among the countries of the world, only Britain and Italy have air forces that are independent and not subordinate to the army and navy. Italy's formation of an independent air force originally followed the example of Britain, and the color of its uniforms and general organization are almost identical to the British Air Force, except for the insignias of rank.</p>
<p>In addition, the British Navy has an aviation unit, which Italy has not emulated. The Italian Navy has never built aircraft carriers. The country's air force must assist the army and navy in combat and, when necessary, must operate independently. The original organization of the Italian Air Force was aimed at fighting in the Mediterranean region. Its argument is that land-based aircraft are definitely more effective than ship-based aircraft.</p>
<p>The Italian Minister of Aviation is also held by Mussolini. The country's aircraft designs are quite sophisticated, and there are often new inventions, but they vary in quality. Its manufacturing is far inferior to that of Britain and Germany. Therefore, the equipment of Italy's best aircraft fleet is vastly different from that of the rest of the fleet. There are many first-line aircraft in Italy, but their styles are mostly outdated. Although the Italian authorities are trying to reorganize the aircraft fleet and supplement it with new aircraft, they have not achieved much success. It is estimated that Italy's current air force expansion and reorganization plan will take three years to complete.</p>

<p>Last autumn, I went to Qin Chuan to visit the sick, suddenly shocked that the daylilies withered before the hall. For four years, the mandarin duck wings were idle, and the mother's and son's money was divided overnight. The calyxes did not flourish, and the brothers were few. The relatives looked at each other even worse. Let the bright earrings and green sleeves be separated. This body is rolled and bound like a cocoon. To sue in the public court is foolish and deaf. The cuckoo cries in vain in the east wind. From then on, there will be no long objects outside the body, and drifting is now like a broken tumbleweed. Instead, I resigned from Qin Chuan to rest in Yong, and I re-searched Jing Zhao to paint my eyebrows with charm. How could I expect that Feng Lang would betray Xiao Qing, causing Hong Fu to bid farewell to Yang Su. Alone, where can I rely? The loquat still remembers the gates of my old garden. Arranging strings and new melodies, dusting off silk robes and old dance clothes. The fragrance of a beautiful name has always been scented with orchids, and still the carriages and horses are like a market in front of the door. Leaning on the seat, I remotely watch the old swallows fly, and the spring mud has fallen purple from the empty beams. Yesterday I heard Qing's pipa playing, and I knew that Qing's heart was not clear. The celestial raft carries the spring like the sea, and it tells the Eastern Emperor with a different feeling. This feeling is similar to that of Xunyang. Sima's green shirt once again covers his tears. For Qing, I will continue to compose "Pipa Ballad," and after reading it, you will surely know that your heart will be broken.</p>

<h3 id="e95">Thunder and Lightning <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>— Jin Zhen</p>
<p>The weather in the hot summer is always changing. In the first half of the day, there is a clear blue sky, occasionally decorated with one or two white clouds. The fire-like sun is scorching the ground. By the second half of the day, the white clouds gradually disappear, but are replaced by layers of dark clouds, inlaid piece by piece in the air, blocking the sunlight so that it cannot penetrate even a trace of light. The entire long sky is full of traces of dark clouds. In the evening, there is sometimes a faint rumble of thunder transmitted from the western horizon, and the sky becomes darker and darker. The dark clouds are rushing from the east with great momentum, carried by the wind, and stealthily advancing unnoticed, and the thunder slowly sounds again.</p>
<p>Suddenly a flash of lightning, this flash is really unexpected. In an instant, it illuminates the dark house brightly, clearly recognizing: it is the home of Ah Hui. Then a deafening thunderclap, as if splitting down on Ah Hui's head, startled him to hide in his mother's arms, while Ah Ming sat calmly, as if nothing had happened.</p>
<p>"Don't be afraid, if you don't do wrong things usually, you don't have to be afraid! It hits those bad people with black hearts." His mother comforted him softly and kindly.</p>
<p>He hid for a while, until the thunder gradually subsided and the lightning was not very bright, that is when he dared to stand up. But he heard his brother laughing at his timidity and uselessness.</p>
<p>"Brother, why aren't you afraid of thunder?" "Thunder is a very ordinary phenomenon. It is entirely due to the clouds carrying electricity, and the air in the sky is insulated, meaning that electricity cannot pass through the air. When the electricity in the clouds is about to pass through the air, it clashes with the air. When the two collide, sparks are emitted, and sounds are also produced. The light of the sparks, we have always called it electricity, and the sound is called thunder. We on the ground see the lightning first, and then hear the thunder, but in fact, the thunder and electricity occur at the same time, so why do we have a before and after? It turns out that they are holding a race. The speed of electricity is faster than thunder, so the lightning arrives on the ground first. When thunder occurs, there is only a bang, but what we hear is a bang, bang, bang... echoing constantly, because the thunder is caused by the heat of the sparks rapidly expanding the air. If the sound encounters other clouds or other high mountains and deep valleys, there will be an echo, so the urgent sound is followed by an answer from the other side. In this way, the thunder is very prolonged and continues to sound. Sometimes, sparks also fly between the clouds and the ground. If there are people and other houses there, then people will be electrocuted to death, and houses will burn down. This is indeed very terrible. People who are struck by lightning are all black. We accuse them of being bad people. Wouldn't it be wrong if they were good people? If thunder strikes always kill bad people, then no one in the world would dare to do bad things. Therefore, this sentence that my mother just said is not scientific, but we should not do bad things either. Therefore, this unscientific sentence has had quite a lot of effect in my scientifically backward country."</p>
<h3 id="e96">The Little Experiences of Learning to Write <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Yu</p>
<p>(1) Learning to Connect Characters</p>
<p>I spent many years in private school learning to connect characters. When I began to learn composition, it was all about connecting characters. The teacher would give a character, and I could attach another character above or below it. I remember the first time; the teacher gave the character "天" (tiān, sky), and I attached "上" (shàng, above) below it, forming "天上" (tiān shàng, in the sky). I wrote it on a small, tofu-like white paper, and the teacher marked it correct with two circles. I thought writing was just like this, quite easy. Once, the teacher gave the character "閏" (rùn, leap). I thought for a long time but couldn't find a character to connect. Suddenly, I remembered the phrase "閏餘成歲" (rùn yú chéng suì, leap years make up the year) from the Thousand Character Classic. So, I wrote "閏餘" (rùn yú, leap remainder) and gave it to the teacher. He asked me what it meant, and I had to honestly say I copied it from the Thousand Character Classic. Fortunately, the teacher didn't scold me but explained the meaning of "閏餘" to me. I was very grateful. I don't think children today learn this method of connecting characters. Learning to connect characters before writing prevents random, forced combinations, which isn't entirely meaningless!</p>
<p>(2) Learning to Form Sentences</p>
<p>After learning to connect characters reasonably well, the teacher taught me to form sentences. The teacher would give a character, and I had to add at least two characters to make a sentence. Thinking about it now, two characters can form a sentence, like "我笑" (wǒ xiào, I laugh) or "狗叫" (gǒu jiào, dog barks). However, back then, the teacher required at least three characters. The sentences became longer and more complex. Eventually, I could link two or three sentences together. Writing is essentially composing an article by accumulating sentences. If you can form sentences, it's easy to connect them and create an article. Unfortunately, I still don't fully understand the different types of sentence structures in Chinese. The sentence formation I learned was only a part of it, but it was still very useful! Children, you may not have learned sentence formation methods. I spent several months on it in my youth. If you feel your sentences aren't well-formed, I think you should specifically study it!</p>
<p>(3) Learning Question and Answer</p>
<p>After learning to form sentences reasonably well, the teacher taught me to answer questions. From the books I read, he would ask questions about history, geography, etc., and I had to answer them without looking at the books. Once, I made a huge joke. The teacher asked a question from a history book, "Who conquered the tribes?" I believe children would easily answer this. My answer was truly bizarre: "The answer is that the one who conquered the tribes was Luo Zhi Huangdi." Children reading my answer might be shocked! Where did Luo Zhi Huangdi come from? My teacher was also completely puzzled and asked me what Luo Zhi Huangdi meant. I was very proud, thinking my answer was so profound that even the teacher didn't understand it. I happily opened the history book and pointed to the text below a portrait, saying, "The conqueror of the tribes, Huangdi." People's names have at most two characters, so this Huangdi must be called Luo Zhi Huangdi. Upon hearing this, the teacher realized I was misinterpreting the text below the picture and randomly taking things out of context. He smiled and explained it to me, and I suddenly understood. My face turned red, and I couldn't even lift my head. It shows that to answer questions, you must first understand the meaning of the book; answering randomly is not acceptable.</p>
<p>(4) Learning Empty Words</p>
<p>After learning question and answer reasonably well, the teacher taught me how to use empty words (function words). The fluency of writing entirely depends on the use of empty words. When used properly, the writing will be fluent. Empty words in classical Chinese include 之 (zhī), 乎 (hū), 者 (zhě), 也 (yě), 豈 (qǐ), 雖然 (suī rán), 然而 (rán ér), 然則 (rán zé), etc. In modern Chinese, they include 的 (de), 了 (le), 嗎 (ma), 呢 (ne), etc. The first empty words the teacher taught me were "豈不……哉" (qǐ bù... zāi, how can it not be...), "非……耶" (fēi... yé, is it not...), "不亦……乎" (bù yì... hū, is it not also...). It's easier to use empty words at the beginning and end of a sentence. The next empty words he taught me were "旣非……又不……" (jì fēi... yòu bù..., not only not... but also not...). Using these four empty words in several sentences is much harder. Then he taught me to use "雖……然……則……也" (suī... rán... zé... yě, although... but... then... also), which was basically making a small paragraph. Of course, there are many other ways to use empty words. I remember writing a paragraph every day and spending over two months before completing this stage. Children, modern Chinese also has empty words. How to use them is worth noting. In fact, from connecting characters to forming sentences, from forming sentences to answering questions, from answering questions to using empty words, these are all basic tasks in learning to write. Regardless of whether the method is old or new, as long as it's effective. Now everyone thinks this is old-fashioned and not worth paying attention to, but I think that's wrong. Of course, how to adapt and improve it is necessary.</p>
<p>(5) Assigned Topic Composition</p>
<p>After learning the usage of empty words reasonably well, the teacher would assign topics for us to write essays. Initially, the topics were simple, and I could write them quickly, making rapid progress. Later, the topics became deeper, and the teacher's corrections became stricter, so my grades naturally weren't high. I remember once the teacher assigned the topic "師克在和" (shī kè zài hé, victory lies in harmony) from the Zuo Zhuan. I was stunned. Winning a battle depends on mutual harmony. The topic already said everything. What was I supposed to write? After much thought, I barely managed to write 200 characters. The teacher saw it, got very angry, marked a check at the beginning and end with ink, and crossed out the entire essay. He wrote a new one for me and, of course, scolded me. At that time, I was somewhat unconvinced. Even if my essay was bad, could I not use a single word? Even if the teacher's essay was good, could there be nothing wrong with it? But the teacher was dignified, and I didn't dare to object. Later, I could write even difficult topics well. Sometimes, the entire essay was densely circled and dotted with approval. The teacher was pleased, and I was also pleased. Once I got a topic, I could write 1,000 or 2,000 characters, as if the sentences were readily available and the meaning was endless. So, I liked to submit articles to newspapers. At that time, newspapers had multiple editorials, and my writing was sometimes selected for publication. Once, I went to the Minquan Bao to collect稿費 (gǎo fèi, payment for articles). The chief editor, Mr. Zhou Hao, specially invited me for a conversation. Seeing that I was a young student, he said many encouraging words. Before leaving, he gave me the four characters "鍊才就範" (liàn cái jiù fàn, refine talent to follow the rules). After that, my writing went from unrestrained to concise. But I'm truly ashamed that even now, I still don't write well and am not satisfied with myself. As the saying goes, "Three years of initial learning, one can go anywhere; three more years of learning, one can hardly move an inch." These words are truly accurate!</p>

<h3 id="e99">Dynamics of Several Famous Female Performers in Shanghai <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>— Only Me</p>
<p>The situation in the northern Peking opera scene is different from before. Female performers (坤角, kūn jué) still form their own troupes and take the lead, and their appeal is quite good. Looking at the current situation, the performers in the north include Wang Yurong, Zhao Xiaolan, Wu Suqiu, Liang Yunqiu, Dong Huimai, Huang Yuhua, and others. Among these many "leading female performers":</p>
<p>Wang Yurong</p>
<p>She was originally the most popular and had the greatest drawing power. However, since she came to Shanghai last year, stopped performing, and returned north, for some reason, her box office performance has greatly declined. Therefore, Yurong was embarrassed to perform in Beiping again and had the intention of returning south. At the beginning of last month, Yurong posted "Farewell Commemorative Performances" and performed "Yanmenguan" for two nights. The newspaper published the words "Returning south today, no return to the north indefinitely," and it sold out for two nights in a row. Because the business had a major turnaround, Yurong canceled the intention of returning south and is now performing as usual in Beiping.</p>
<p>Wu Suqiu</p>
<p>She wasn't very popular in Beiping. After coming to Shanghai to update her stage presence, she was very well-received by audiences after returning to Beiping. Especially her performance of "Spinning Cotton," which always sold out. It was popular throughout the nine cities. It is said that Wu Suqiu and Xiaolan both have some merchants who "specially sell seats," buying up red tickets, so their box office performance can surpass everyone else. Also, Suqiu will come here again soon at the invitation of Gengxin to follow Tan Fuying's troupe.</p>
<p>Huang Yuhua</p>
<p>This name is very unfamiliar. This person has the same name as Wang Yuhua. Some people think she is the new Yanqiu, but she is someone else. She is a novice, only sixteen or seventeen years old. Because someone from the banking industry strongly supports her, she also hangs up the signboard of leading performer. "Art" is out of the question, but because there are people to support her, the box office is not lagging behind. Liang Yunqiu and Dong Huimai's art is mediocre, and those who support them are also mediocre, so their performance is not as good as Huang Yuhua.</p>
<p>Hou Yulan</p>
<p>Since breaking up with Xi Xiaobo, there has long been talk of her leading her own troupe, but it has not been realized yet. Yulan is now paired with Yang Baosen and the female performer Song Zongying. Li Zongying is one of the female performers who went from Shanghai to Beiping. She has not performed often in Beiping recently. After Zhang Wenjuan came north, she performed several times and received extremely good reviews. Nai Shuai Zhang Rongkui is also having a comeback, and their joint performances have been greatly appreciated by the people of the nine cities.</p>
<p>Qiu Yunyan</p>
<p>She also went from Shanghai to Beiping. After coming to Beiping, she became a student of the old performer Wang Yaoqing, paying a tuition fee of 1,000 yuan, setting a record for Yaoqing's acceptance of students. Qiu Yunyan has now changed her name to Zhang Yunyan and is studying very diligently. There is no news of her forming a troupe to perform yet, but there are already many people who support Zhang. There will be no problem selling red tickets in the future. It is expected that the performance will be good and will not disappoint the people of the south.</p>

<p>— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter 5: Bad News</p>
<p>It was quiet inside for a moment. I peeked through the doorway again. Yu Gantang was taking off his short coat, with his back to the door. He spoke again.</p>
<p>"Zhaoqi, you still don't know the stimulation I've received. I absolutely cannot just let it go."</p>
<p>"I understand. But this matter is ultimately meaningless and too dangerous—"</p>
<p>"Dangerous? I'm not afraid of anything. I must do it!"</p>
<p>"Okay, okay, then you should go up to my floor and lie down. You said you didn't sleep well last night."</p>
<p>I suddenly heard the sound of stomping on the floor. "I must beat him to death!" "Hey, keep your voice down—what? The door is also open!"</p>
<p>I felt my position was dangerous. In fact, I had to leave. I quickly moved away from the doorway, quickened my steps, and walked towards the alley entrance. I hadn't even walked three steps when I heard the sound of the door opening behind me. I frankly walked out of the alley entrance and stood on the sidewalk for a moment, planning my next steps. Should I find a policeman and immediately arrest Yu Gantang? There seemed to be no need to rush. Since he had a place to stay and wouldn't suspect that others suspected him—just now, I felt he was staring at me in the elevator, which was entirely due to my own apprehension. He would definitely not run away. How to deal with it later could be left to Hawthorne to decide. At this time, I was most concerned about Hawthorne. Where did he go? Did he go back first? It wasn't likely in this situation. But he might have also encountered Zhao Boxiong by chance and followed him. After a minute of consideration, I decided to go back to the Aiwen Road residence first. Even if Hawthorne hadn't returned, there might be a message left at the residence. (79)</p>
