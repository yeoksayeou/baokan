<p>社評</p>
<h3>德國對法條件的性質</h3>
<p>『法國將越南交予日本』，這是昨日路透社所傳德義兩國最近對法國維希當局所提媾和七條件中的一條；此外，一條是要法國交出殘餘的海軍與空軍，統歸德義調遣；還有五條，亦有關法國的領土與殖民地，或割讓，或共管，或合營。據說：法國倘若接受此項條件，且與德義合作，對英國宣戰，則現在德國即將一部分軍事佔領區域，還由維希政府管轄：並待德義戰勝英國後，宰割英國時，許法國分享一臠。又據說：維希組織中的副總理賴伐爾，外交總長鮑恩，海軍總長達蘭爾等，贊成如此辦法；賴伐爾正在奔走於維希當局與巴黎的德國權威之間，企圖玉成其事。又據說：維希元首貝當，國防總長魏剛等，鑒此條件內容，以爲賴伐爾所欲玉成之局，法蘭西將有瓦解之憂，故擬堅拒此項條件。普天之下。凡是自由的人羣，共和的國民，倘爲尊車珍惜自由權與共和制而一眷念此權此制所由發祥的法國，現在遭遇了國內外的極度橫逆，竟使國運顚沛至於斯極，當無不爲之歎息而痛心。雖說：現在這樣遭遇，並非突然的意外酷虐；在賴伐　鮑恩等，抑且如貝當魏剛等，當初萎縮了抗戰的決心，敗壞了抗戰的民意。放棄了抗戰的武器，離異了抗戰的與國，無條件的屈膝於敵軍之前，以求所謂光榮的息戰，則任何苛刻條件，無一而不在意料中；可謂自始已然，並非於今爲酷；雖說苛刻條件之下的局部割讓，到底還是較勝於無條件的滅亡；而貝當與魏剛雖至今日而似比賴伐爾輩較高一籌，然由卑怯而矛盾而支離，又安見其些微較善於賴伐爾輩的澈底？同時却又已盛傳了賴伐爾行將繼代而爲維希元首。然而我們絕不相信，乃謂法國文化的，物質的，歷史的，現實的，乃至今後前途，一切的一切，竟然是宿命裏註定了祇供賴伐爾作嫁奩！我們豈不可作如是觀：彼法國不問是貝當或賴伐爾的。是德國的或法國人的，與我們無干。似乎不必爲之歎息痛心：所不相信者，亦大可不求甚解。然感觸感念，必爲具有心靈的人們所不能自已；况法國的運命如何，現在究竟尙在未定之天。其興衰存亡，動關世界的別一隅，則如何可以漠視？而德義與法國之間，不先小後而在今日講條件，以及七條件中「法國將越南交予日本」一款，允對於關心世變的人們，提供了重妥的參考資料。蓋德國從開戰之後，自東而北而西，可謂戰無不勝。攻無不克；而法國在無條件之下求得息戰，更助成了德國所向無前的憑藉；現在正應該是德國爲所欲爲，以貫澈其遠大理想的時日，何以忽於此日此時，向法國提示條件？何以欲以局部的割讓來決定德法整個的關係？何以願以法國領屬分予西班牙與日本，謂慷他人之慨，詎非自己血戰所得？何以對於所征服的降將軍，亦予以分潤的期票？凡此問題，除了視爲德國已經自覺祇得義大利爲與國，不夠爭覇，不夠領導創設所謂歐洲新秩序；故內亂經年，瘡痍未復的西班牙，與頹唐渙散，抱殘守缺的維希政權，以及深陷泥淖，自拔不遑的日本，皆在張羅之列；總之，往日自信挾有雷霆萬鈞之力，目無全牛，今則不得已而不捐細小；此外，無可爲問題的答案。即此答案，說明了整個國際，整個戰局之中，雙方聲勢力量的如何一消一長。即此消長，必爲關心世變者所注意；而循此消長，允必爲反侵略者所忻慰。至於「法國將越南交予日本」，在表面上，是今日德國所纔提示，是法國所尙未接受的條件之一；然德國與日本間，必先交換了勾結的條件而後同盟，決不會先成交而後講價；質言之，德國早已將越南代法國斷送於日本了，事實上不待今日與法國商量。明日待法國接受，而後交割讓渡。可知德國對法國所提示的，實際祗是非遵不可的命令，至少關於越南的一條件是命令。然則正在奔走的賴伐爾，以及猶擬堅拒條件的貝當魏剛，祗是點綴劇情的配角，或是蒙在鼓裏的「阿笨」；而海防河內方面所憧憧往來，所有會議的形式，磋商的口吻，祗是巧取豪奪的一種姿態，祗是交割讓渡之前，劇情的波折而已。法國憂時愛國之士，爲了越南，盡知竭能，還想保得一分是一分，而不知儘自盤旋於維希與巴黎之間，不知跳出釜俎之外，這又是至堪嘆息而痛心的。</p>

<h3>溫莎公的新職</h3>
<p>自白慕大開往巴哈馬之「索茂斯夫人」號，係於八月十七日晨抵達首都拿沙。除了履新的溫莎公夫婦和他們的隨從人員外，船上祇有乘客一人。上午九時一刻公爵等一行下船，走下跳板，由聖喬治船塢碼頭上岸，經過勞斯東廣塲而至總督府之議會，官誓就職典禮卽在此處舉行。島上的黑人土著，聽得「英王—他們還不知他已遜位—駕到，大家異常興奮。男女老小，大的有幾千人，都在碼頭上和公爵夫婦經過的途旁迎候。這些黑人，赤着脚，看見溫莎公等一行走過，高聲歡呼示敬。熱鬧的情形比之百慕大。自要加上好幾倍，所相同的，就是公爵夫人還是穿着同樣的一襲衣服而已。</p>
<p>由碼頭至議會，沿途結綵，港內的船舶上也懸旗誌慶，並有大字歡迎標語。內中有一幅標語道：於哥倫布，一四九二年；溫莎公一九四〇年」，土人的歡迎熱情，可見一斑。</p>
<p>參與溫莎公就仟典禮的的有三百人，都穿着禮服或軍裝。這日天氣旣熱，太陽又烈，在這熱帶地區實在熱得可以。來賓揮汗，觀衆喊悶。溫莎公身穿黃色陸軍少將制服，在他夫人入席之後，步入禮堂。公爵夫人長裾搖曳，儀熊萬方；她坐在溫莎公座位旁低一級，較已往總督夫人坐位又高一級的座上。因爲天熱，不時輕搖寳扇。</p>
<p>溫莎公爵夫人座位的對面，懸着央國瑪麗皇太后高一丈又餘的巨大畫像。華貴莊嚴，慈祥煦和，令人起敬。行禮之時旣到，溫莎公科首立於　有王冠標幟之紅色華蓋下，略現顫動及侷促不安之狀。俄而伸手入左袖，拿出一方手帕，此時林道潑上校方高聲朗頌任命狀。繼之卽爲戴假髮，穿長袍的大法官達賴監誓。</p>
<p>溫莎公對面有一面巨鏡，上面是雪白的承塵。溫莎的一舉一動，都反映鏡中。這時候他歛容小笑，現着很嚴肅的樣子。跟着大法官斷斷續續的唸出下面的誓詞：一我愛德華·亞爾白·克立期　·喬治·安特之·柏德立克·大衛，溫莎公，謹誓依法，以至誠効忠喬治王陛下，及其子嗣及承繼人，願上帝佑找。一自愛德華以下，那連串的都是溫涉公的名字，如此報名，可謂齊備甚矣。</p>
<p>宣誓畢，溫莎公執特製龜壳筆在公文上簽名，並繼續作就職式的宣誓。前部與上述的誓文相同，結未的字句，則爲：「我在巴哈馬總督及海陸軍總指揮任內，悉心爲喬治王陛下服役」。二次簽字畢，溫莎公挺直身子，朝他夫人看看，傾聽議長摩亞及議員的翰生的演說。</p>
<p>演說完畢，溫莎致答詞，他沒有演講底稿，祗把在船上所預備着的幾句話，卽席致答。首先他向歡迎者道謝，决述其途中旅行之經過情形，再决希望在任期中能盡其棉薄。最後道：「巴哈馬與其他不列顚殖民地相同，因受戰爭影響，方謀有以解決其困難。余不問在任久暫，盡力共謀解決之道。余與公爵夫人首决夾臨茲島，心中欣悅，不言而喻。愚夫婦受拿沙人士熱烈歡迎，實深感幸。茲後居住此間，良晤正多，云云。</p>
<p>詞竟，大家揮汗歡呼三聲，於是夫婦兩人開始與在塲許多白黑人握手。公爵夫人與三百來賓握手，在大熱天氣，也是一件苦事，他們却面堆笑容，樂此不疲。女賓中有一人對公爵夫人行曲膝禮。另一女賓要想如法泡製」，結果却一變心」而沒有實現。</p>
<p>十時才敲過，公爵夫婦站在陽台，向人民揚手表示謝意。這時候總督　門前空隙之處充　了瞻仰公爵夫婦丯彩的土著，大聲歡呼致敬，情形最爲熱烈。最後樂隊奏英國國歌，溫莎公在莊嚴的氛圍中，舉手行敬禮，就職曲禮至此始完全終了，公爵夫婦也就雙　驅車至政府官舍休息，大進冷飮。</p>
<p>公爵夫人綽的冬姿，光彩動人，原是個美人胎兒；加以服裝麗都，善自修飾，在這巴哈馬島上，出落得如嫦娥下凡，叫人眼光一新。在她丈夫就職後數日總督府中舉行宴會，公爵夫人以女主人地位，自須盛裝華服，款待嘉賓。何如島上還沒有華貴的美容館可供夫人應用。她祇得拍了個電報，給紐的一家法國理髮店，要他們立派著名理髮帥福萊士脫，到拿沙巷她燙髮修容。理髮師接到電報，不敢待慢，就帶了一架洪髮器，和胭脂，香粉，指甲油，脣膏等化妝品，在二十四小時之內搭了飛機，趕往巴哈馬島。公爵夫人這種寬綽舉動，恐怕世界上難得找出第二人罷。</p>
<p>巴哈馬設置總督以來，的已有二百年，溫莎公爵夫婦所居住的官舍房屋，也是所陳舊的屋子，已有一百叫十年之久。公爵夫人那樣愛好美觀的太太，當然要把遭所古舊的房子，重加裝修。可惜在此國難期中，一切支出不能豐裕，巴哈馬議會所核准的房屋繕費祇有美金八千元。公爵夫人因之不得向不節的之途前進。公爵夫人的朋友孟台爾命婦已受命。共同籌劃刷新房屋的事務。</p>
<p>新任總督夫婦所住的官邸，建築於一八〇一年，計有臥窒七間，浴室六間，其他房間二十四個。其中包括行政會議室，私人秘書室，及一個大跳舞廳。目下大客廳中的傢具已改漆爲玫瑰色—英國瑪麗皇太后所最愛的顔色—餐室中一丈高的太后畫像，爲她嬪先王喬治五世時的新嫁娘學束。官舍中原有僕役六人，一仍其舊。但新總督夫婦勢將另行增加幾個。</p>
<p>這所官舍建築頗　，只是陳舊了些。前任總督　經在風景優美的高地，建築新字，要求議會准其將官邸遷人，已被吾決。如果溫莎公要遷栘官舍，恐怕其結果亦將相同吧。在前任總督之前，歷任總督凡要求遷居或增加俸給的，一概遭到同樣的否決。溫莎公的副自杜萊，去年曾在拿沙渦冬，巳在海灘邊找到兩處別墅，可供公爵夫婦燕息之需。他日拿沙社會交際的風尙，恐亦將從此轉變。　（完）</p>
<h3>敎育消息　全國國民體育會議　圓滿結束發表宣言　明定九月九日爲國民體育節</h3>

<p>宣言全文</p>
<p>立國　素有三、曰敎育　曰經濟、曰武　、此　裁指示吾人所嘗致力於建國之途徑、而敎育　爲其中主要之一環、至敎育方針、則總裁更明舉文武並重、術德兼修」之義、以袪　時畸形偏頗之弊、允爲吾敎育界同人所拳拳服膺　弗敢須臾忘者、國民體育會議之舉行、於時適富抗戰第四年度之國慶、於地則在領導全民抗戰之陪都、外瞻世界大戰之日益蔓延、內看抗戰之日近勝利、每一念及總裁之訓示、愈覺吾敎育界尤其吾體育界同人、對於抗戰建國所負責任之重大、而懍然於使命之容有未盡、　當鄭重討論之餘、願舉決議各案祗要旨、爲吾全國同胞的略言之、</p>
<p>曰確立國民體靑實施計劃之方針</p>
<p>古代教育、別爲六藝書數而外、禮樂射御無不與體育有關、誠以體格不强、自衛目難、遑言衛國、故國民體育之實施、應以增强國民體力、實現國家敎育宗旨爲其目的、必使國民人人有授受體育鍜鍊之義務、亦卽人人有享受體育運動之權利、然　體育可以確實普遍化、平民化、而國家民族强盛之基礎、乃確立而不拔、抑體育不僅僅爲增强國民之體力而已、增强體育之結果、可以充實人民之生活、可以扶植社會之生存、可以富裕國民之生計、可以延續民族之生命、故國民體育之實施、決非僅以少數個人爲對象、而實無時無地不以全國國民爲對象、換言之、乃以全民族爲對象也、惟願吾全國敎育界、旣定方針之下、因時制宜、因地制宜、因人制宜、因事制宜、奮力邁進、殊途同歸、則功效大騐，當有可期、</p>
<p>一日培養體育師資獎勵學術研究</p>
<p>體育事　之推進與擴展、有賴於體育人才之培養、而學術上之硏究亦爲萬不可忽、爲治本計、中央宜籌設五年制體育師範專科學校、各省市宜酌設體育師範學校、或體育師範科、大量造就中等以上學校、及小學校之體育師資、同時培植國民體育之幹部人才爲治標計、則凡體育專科或體育師範學校、以及凡有體育科系之學校、均應視國民敎育實施上之需要、附設各種有關體育之訓練班、以最目前體育人才缺乏之窮、至對於體育學術有特殊研究確具成績者、國家更當特別加以獎掖、凡可以鼓勵研究體育之法、如設立體育硏究所、派遣體育留學生、編譯體育書報、實騐體育敎材等等、政府與社會均宜盡共能力、次第舉辦、使一般國民對於體育之觀念、日益正確、對於體育之興趣、日益濃厚、則國民體育之進展、必事半而功倍、</p>
<p>三曰學校體育與社會體育之改進興推行</p>
<p>敎育　前已頒訂各級學校體育實施方案、及各級學校體育設備暫行最低限度標準、茲爲切實執行計、自宜明定進度限期完成、使學校體育不致成爲紙上空談、而中小學學牛體格之測量、與運動技能之測騐、亦宣從速完成俾得藉爲依據、就科學方法與統計原理、按各級學生之年齡與性別、分別訂定各項運動之體育成績量表、此就學校體育言也、至若社會體育、則如一般民衆、普通壯丁、社會靑年、或公務人員等等、應各分別性質、決定各項適宜之髒育設施、凡有學校或體育塲或天然環境、可以利用爲民衆練習運動之所者、應無不盡量使用、以求體育實施之普遍、同時製定國民體育成績測騐標準、示之模楷、復以種種方法、造成社會重視體育樂於運動之風氣、務使一般國民之體格、均能達此標準、例如明定九月九日爲國民體育卽、卽造成風氣之一端、更爲觀摩研究起見、宜卽籌設中央體育衛牛博物館集合有關體育衛生之標本材料、統計圖表等等、俾全國國民得知吾人體格之缺憾何在、而相與努力改造、以求其精進、此則有關於國民體育者至切、允望以全力、求其實現者也、</p>
<p>四曰衛牛敎育國術敎育與童子軍敎宵等之改進</p>
<p>體育與衛生、實二而一、故言體育小能不注意於衛生敎育、就機構言、中央衛生敎育之主管機關、原爲敎育部、而衛生署副之衛生敎育之行政、由敎育部負責、而其器材及技術、則由衛生署負責、各省市則敎育廳局應設衛生敎育委員會、以主其事、總之、必使需育與衛生敎育雙方切實聯繫、方司收增强國民體力之實效、國術爲吾國固有鍛鍊體格之方法、自應列爲學校體育敎材之一徑、並宜田敎育部組織國術敎材編審委員會、釐訂敎材、限期完成、同時各地遍設國術敎線所、　　養敎練國術之師資、至於童子軍課程之內容輿方法、亦宜更予修訂、使能切合實際、允望蜴力推進社會童子軍、以應實際之需要、使童子軍不僅成學校之點級品、</p>
<p>五曰健全全國國民體育行政組織</p>
<p>國　體育旣爲一般人所重視、則職掌此項事實之行政組織、要當有一顯明之系統、中央當以敎育部爲主管機關、其他有關機構之體育中管人員、則應有密切聯繫之組織敎育部主管體育之行政機構、宜設一司、俾負全國體育推行之專責、各省市縣亦宜有負此專　之科或股、或主管人員、關於體育督導與視察之制度、更當積極施行、俾一切體育設施、均能實事求是、款不虛糜、至體育塲地設置之宣充實、體靑活動工具之宜大量製造、廉價供給、則爲普遍推行國民體育之必要條件、自更不待言矣、</p>
<p>總之、今後吾人推進國民體育之主旨、決非在於粉飾門面、允不類於競技賣藝、乃視爲復與民族振衰起頹之基本工作、故認定爲敎育部門主要事業之一、唯其如此、故吾人理想中積極實施國民體育之效果、一般國民當有適合健康標準之體格一也、當有自衛衛國之技能二也、當有服勞互助整齊嚴肅之習慣三也、當有文質合度之禮貌克己合羣之修養叫也、必如是、實施國民體育之最低標準、始克謂爲達到、亦必如是、敎育始可收文武合一之效、而與武力經濟相配合、以完成建國之大業、同人等謹願以此自勉、並與國人共勉焉、</p>

<h3>華德主敎游美歸滬　談美國準備大戰　經濟鞏固生產能力邁進　足可應付兩洋同時作戰　人民對歐亞戰爭態度有驚人轉變</h3>
<p>字　西報云、基督敎美以美會華德主敎去　返　休假、近從奮金山啟程回華、道出日本、勾留數日、轉乘柯立芝總統號郵船來滬、於二十三日晨抵埠、華德主敎對於日本情况、拒不置　、但向新聞記者詳述在美觀察所得印象、</p>
<p>美國殆將</p>
<p>不免一戰</p>
<p>六閱月來、美國對於歐亞兩洲戰爭之態度、已有驚人轉變、美國民意現已準備在太平洋與大西洋同時作戰、美國人固不欲戰爭、惟多數人皆以爲美國不免一戰、美國政府與人民對於當前問題與危機、業已認淸、因已準備一致行動、以應付一切、美國備戰、已日見充實、各種基本工業、數年以來、僅發揮其生產能力百分之六七十、今則急起直追、已達百分之九　、或竟逢百分之白矣、</p>
<p>整軍經武</p>
<p>上下一心</p>
<p>證券市　異常　挺、堅挺、凡遇國際間任何驚人新發展、亦僅稍疲而已、外國所發生之事變及　互相勾結請勢、早經料及、美國上下、並不驚奇、抑美國在財政上與政治上之行動、固有確定之進行方針、一方面撥款數十億元、整軍經武、政府有所提案國會類皆立卽通過、蓋參衆兩院、已知政府對於國際危機與歐亞兩洲之變化、獲有極重要之情報、因信大局確屬緊急、美國人民對戰爭問題之情緒與思想亦已大變、此層允關重要、無論威爾基或羅斯福當選總統、於美國備戰情形與決心、不致發生重大更變、可斷言也、</p>
<p>英美團結</p>
<p>較昔堅強</p>
<p>近年以來、美國在經濟上力事調整、如他國續有挑釁步驟、致使美國在兩洋同時作戰、其經濟機構、亦能屹然交持、何况英國海軍實力、依然無恙、目今英美兩國之團結、以視上决世界大戰、允爲堅强、上次大戰、兩年之後、美始參戰、今則僅歷年餘，美國政府與人民深知其所牽涉之問題、及其對於美國之意義爲如何矣、至於徵召靑年數百萬人、入睦海軍服役、及政府有權在必要時徵用產物財富兩事、僅係美國在心理上備戰之徵象而已、</p>
<p>國際情勢</p>
<p>人人瞭解</p>
<p>美國大多數人民對於國際問題、意見一致、苟以內部政爭與之相較、殊不足道、孤立主義、早已消滅、家家戶戶、逐日殷切聆聽無綫電報吿國際消息、美國　紙雜誌、則均斥鉅資、派遺最幹練之訪員、駐在世界各地、採訪翔實消息、報吿　　民衆凡欲明瞭美國輿情之力　　動員實力者、此種　實、不能忽視、</p>
<p>言詞溫和</p>
<p>行動果敢</p>
<p>現行國際爭門中之主動地位、近巴從德義兩國轉人吳美方面、美國對於亞洲歐洲任何國雖仍欲避免公開戰事，然已承認僅訴諸條的與國際會讓之時期、業已過去、上决世界大戰時、威爾遜總統及第二十六任總統齊奧陀維斯福所主張之「言語溫和、手持巨棒、」政策、已重現於今日、欲德民治國奮起並實行徵兵、頗費時日、然望國現已奮起、並迅速實行徵兵矣、</p>

<p>任何事變</p>
<p>華德主敎　謂　離美前數月、曾兩　　貫美洲大陸、行跡並達美國最僻遠數州、親向各界人民探問憲見與態度、乃知美國民衆對世界戰爭問題、莫不關心、交戰國茍能恢復理智、對國際問題作公允之談判、則美國仍願會同他國共謀和平、但美國今巳決心用其最大力量應付任何事變、此乃明白可見者、</p>
<h3>滬西日封鎖區　已餓斃人命　日方搜檢全區　居民存亡未卜　解除慘刦有待援助</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報云、極可非而路通愚陳露之各里弄、昨日仍由日憲兵「市警」及「特務人員」繼續封鎖、弄內居民、因不能出外購物、結果已有二人餓斃在內、一爲年近六十之老翁、一爲身患疾病之十四歲靑年、</p>
<p>搜檢擴大</p>
<p>滬西日憲兵隊伍長佐藤精一、於本月十八日在愚園路六六八　（昨報誤刋爲六（八弄）遇刺斃命後、白方卽在滬西一帶、施行嚴密戒備、日憲兵沿途密佈、嚴厲搜查行人、其戒備搜喳她區、初僅限於愚園路·極司斐而路·憶定盤路·大西路·地豐路·等一帶、今晨更已擴展至白利南路及兆豐公園等一帶、遍及滬西之全區、在佐藤遇刺兩日後、愚園路地豐路口、日憲兵卽設有一長案、凡通過該處者、均須將姓名籍貫年齡住址職業登記、在前數日經過該處之婦女、尙無須此項手續、今晨起、則婦女亦不能免、形勢之嚴重，得未曾有、並聞在近數日內、日軍在滬西各馬路搜査之結果、巴有平民約兩百人、被認爲可疑而予逮捕、</p>
<p>交通艱困</p>
<p>目前一路十四路二路公共汽車、及二十路無軌電車、仍　時止駛該區、而以靜安寺路爲終點、另派區間車、行駛靜安寺路至兆豐公園惇信路安和寺路間、現滬西區內住民、均深居簡出、故搭車亦極寥落、昨晨西報記者曾赴該地視察、見由靜安寺進駛至極司非而路及憑園路之公共汽車、均被迫停下、華人乘客、均得下車留下姓名、經搜索後、方得前進、行人及乘汽車者、亦須加以搜査、惟外人尙不受干涉、至日憲兵被刺之出事地點六六八弄錢家巷、北通極司非而路馬路橋、南通凱納路一百八十九弄、凍通愚園路六〇八弄田荘、東北通極司非吻路嚴家宅、日方於出事後、卽將各該處出口、一律架設鐵絲網封鎖、於二十一日晨、日方曾一度着令該封鎖區內居民、互相聯保、准許出入、但此項辦法、曇花一現、卽被取銷、</p>
<p>居民絕食</p>
<p>該處工廠約廿餘商店共百餘所、職工約三千人、居民計兩萬口、該錢家巷內、原有米店一家、存米不過數十石、一星期來、已全部售完、據聞區內之米價、現已增至每担一百六十元、但尙無人購得、貧苦之居民、且已有絕食數日者、糞車及垃圾車因該區被嚴密封銷、故無法入區工作、致區內之糞汚垃圾狼藉不堪、並悉該區中靑菜一斤、達一元二角之鉅、大餅一隻、亦須半元、此種情形、殊有望於國際入士、本人道主義心腸、設法送入食物、藉以濟此數干無事貧民云、</p>
<h3>法租界前晚起　撤除封鎖綱　大部衝要馬路均已通告　捕房仍有隨時封鎖權力</h3>
<p>法租界當局、前爲維持界內治安起見、會採取嚴峻之特別戒備將界內大部份馬路、均以籤絲網封鎖、其少數留有缺口者、亦派有探捕嚴爲防備、二月餘來、迄未稍弛、界內居民、雖極感不便、各商號亦受相當影響、但因戒備嚴峻、故界內</p>
<p>罪行減少</p>
<p>治安遂得以確保、現法租界當局以界因情形安寗、且交通工潮、亦吿解決、爲减少居民交通之困雖起見、特於前晚八時起、將維持一月餘之馬路封鎖、大部撤除、計鐵絲網已被栘去者、有外灘·江西路·老北門·大世界·馬霍路·重慶路·福煦路·聖母院路·亞爾培路·等處、開放缺口者、有吉祥街鄭家木　自然火街·具勒路　馬浪路貝諦鏖路·等、一般居氏、莫不稱便、同時昔日留駐各車要地點之鐵甲車、</p>
<p>已無蹤跡</p>
<p>但此舉並非表示特別戒備之撤除、　各堡壘及重要路口、仍有軍警駐守、交通要道、均增加警力用自動步槍守衛、巡邏隊亦仍活躍、據悉、如法粗界秩序安謐、則有維持現狀較長之可能、否則仍將使用其隨時採用嚴峻辦法之權力、</p>

<p>滬上商業之上底比期將屆、錢業同業公會准今日下午二時舉行內盤會議、對於十底到期之信用款、老戶予以通融展賬、並酌量貸放新款。惟限於經營國貨之工廠行號、各承借之各業、已分別與各行莊接洽、展　償還等手續、至於十底到期之款、雖無切　總計、據估計的有五六千萬元、比較戰前反百减少、蓋戰後各行莊放款、以抵押爲主、信用放款危險太甚、不得不予　緊、鬧於整個上海金副市塲、因游曾依然充斥、以致役機事業猖獗如舊、行莊存款　加、缺乏正當投資途徑，移資人內地、正在推進之中、所以銀根寬裕、市塲尙稱穩定、各業決能渡此十底、惟各業因內地交進阻滯、以致各貨外銷銳减、現正設法辦理滬川滇黔各省客貨聯運，以疏貨運、而蘇商困、</p>

<h3>日軍進犯干鄉　激戰後卽退出</h3>
<p>據航業界確息、十七日晨、日軍進犯于　鄉、日軍四五十名、猛烈攻擊、華軍當予以　　、激烈戰事展開、至午後三時許、日始不支長出、該島現已平靖、滬于航運如常、</p>
<h3>米市現貨充斥　米價昨再回跌</h3>
<p>滬市整個民食、存底逐漸增厚囤戶恐慌異常、咸爲免除意外虧損、均將大量現貨、供應市塲、米市塲人頭簇簇、掮客居間、至爲忙錄、若輩寄是市塲、皆爲行號客說行成交各貨、從中取佣同時斯貨之拋售、亦時有所聞、惟客　頗感胃呆、觀望不納、猶待市價之繼續下落、昨晨米市、開做後、巾况極度德靜、米價　前日跌風、回落生元或一廿左右、並現貨充斥、</p>
<h3>英官塲對撤僑　尚無積極措施　英美煙公司已通知職員　撤退家屬願負擔其旅費</h3>
<p>關於本埠非必要英僑撤退一事，據記者昨向英官塲方面探詢所得、英當局尙未作更進　步之計劃、英僑方面、亦尙未作自動撤退之凖備、但悉本埠英　烟草公司、已通吿全體英美兩國國籍之職員、謂公司對於職員等將其妻子輿兒女等撤　離滬者、願爲負担全部旅費、聞僅有一部職員將利用公司此項優惠之待遇、但衆料時局若更趨惡化、則各職員亦樂於接受、據英商輪船公司稱、英大使館之公吿、尙未有引起預購船票一空之現象、目下本市對歐洲航行上之便利、雖甚受　制、但據記者昨白所知開往澳洲之船隻、則有不少預購船票者、關於英當局如遇時局緊張時、將如何增加船隻、以備撤退僑民之辦法、昨尙無所聞、</p>
<p>華府訓令</p>

<h3>英學者由倫敦抵滬　談歐戰一年觀感（一）　對遠東影響有所敘述</h3>
<p>自歐戰擴大以來，已逾一年，法國戰事挫折以後，各方對英國方面之戰事，允寄以法視，新聲社記者昨趨晤甫於日昨轉道由倫敦到滬之英國某學者名宿，與談歐戰近况。渠曾親歷歐　重要戰區，故所見自較詳盡，而對歐戰與遠東影響，亦有重要觀察，用將各情分誌於决：</p>
<p>法國挫折</p>
<p>法國的崩潰，使英國陷於單獨作戰地位，配備旣精訓練有素的英國遠征軍隊，從艱困的情境中逃避出來，在武備與物質方面，均蒙相當的損失。時至今日，海峽的對岸，已經洛人德人之手，但是在飛離英倫不到半小時的地方，以及英國最大的軍港等處，均有堅强的英國空軍根據地。舉世所預期者，乃是迅速屈降，最好是迅速妥協，那麽德國可以併呑新的戰敗國，轉而對付英帝國。最勇敢而最較德國超　武備的國家，現在惟有一個英國了。</p>
<p>英國空軍</p>
<p>此次歐戰前因後果，現在都已昭然者揭了。二十年來對於國際聯盟的未善運用，引起了糾紛之端。本來要建立一枝大陸軍隊，原是沒有間題的。法國在軍事方面，可以處於主動者的地位，把英國的援力編成十師，那都是機械化部隊，有着最新型的武器。事實上，英國所供給的，有十二師之多，此外尙有不少地方軍的後備兵，以及在戰事爆發以前鑒於時勢危急而已登記未訓練的大批兵士。海軍亦足以控制海洋，萬一德艦活動，頗可相機應付。至於英國空軍，數量雖少，訓練美精，所以德國認爲不能挫壓的，也祗有英國的空軍。</p>
<p>戰略得失</p>
<p>侵略國往往有一種攻擊上得使官處，她可以選擇時間，選擇地　，以使作最有效的猝擊。而防禦國則不然，她旣不知道對方何時來侵襲，於是祇能刻刻戒備，結果因爲防守的時間太長，却　被入擊破了。</p>
<p>撤退之役</p>
<p>在空軍方面，英國的策劃，顯然是優越的，因爲無論配備人選，與德國相較，都凌駕得很遠。有一次，英軍在鄧扣克被困，大家以爲是全軍覆沒了，豈知軍事地位上，雖然已臻不可挽救之絕境，但是由於陸空海全體將士的用命戮力，竟被完成了安然退出的奇蹟，這是德國空軍的第一决失敗。二萬五千個目標中，却祇炸沉了五十艘艦艇，足見空軍的威脅，也如潛水艇一樣地不足畏懼。至於在海峽中欲封銷船舶，允不可能，防守卡萊與杜佛間郝條狹路的德國砲位，並不能阻止護送艦的來往，反使他們安然抵達倫敦。</p>
<p>空襲情形</p>
<p>德機的空襲央倫，先以幾架或小隊飛機作一决偵察，接着就來轟炸飛行塲，把戰鬥機先行趕掉，以便使轟炸機易於下手。然而兩個月來的連續轟炸，結果是一個飛行塲也未被破壞，反而常常接獲報吿，設有多少隊德機，在飛抵英倫海岸之前，先行踅返了。英方有許多顯著的目標，如船塢及飛機製迭廠之類，德國人以爲要來攻襲，代價太大，因爲每决空襲，無論物質損毀或人員死傷，損失均甚輕微，所以德國人竟在不設防城市的工人村舍上，發洩他們的怨憤，投擲他們的炸彈。德國人對於上次大戰時所得的敎訓，早已忘記乾凈，他們竟然以已度人，預備打擊英國的士氣。猶　在拿破崙戰役車，詩入席勒曾勸德國人組織游擊軍隊，以使長期抵抗。但是他們的計劃未被接受，因爲德國入知道戰爭時如果要冒損失家財的危險，他們就不願意打仗的。德機自天空對英倫，須花甚大代價，這個可以八月十八日，九月十五日，二十七臼諸次空襲爲證。至於夜襲，則雖有皎潔月光，而以軍事方面而言，損失亦殊微小。德國轟炸機的數量，與英國戰鬥機相較，往往成四五與一之比。然央國空軍沒有敗績，在幾决空襲之時，防守者則較攻擊者爲便宜，因爲空戰旣在英國士地或海峽上空展開，所以大部分被德機射擊下來的英國飛行員，往往可以得救，而德國飛行員則一經射下，無論生死，皆爲一種損失。其情形之嚴重，可證德國籲請紅十字船可以渡越海峽一事，此種呼籲，原非得已而出的。</p>

<h3>兩公司交通工潮　損失互不賠償　互通車輛昨日尚未恢復</h3>
<p>法商水電公司全體工人、於前日復工後、各車輛均已恢復舊日之行駛路綫、惟行駛徐家滙至外灘之二十二路公共汽車、總數共三十九輛、昨因尙有十餘名工人未能到廠工作、故僅駛出三十四輛、其餘五輛、於今日工人到齊後、亦可開駛出廠、</p>
<p>罷工損失</p>
<p>互不賠償</p>
<p>英商上海電車公司、本與法商電車公司對各所屬車輛在區外行駛、訂有協定、英商五路有軌電車及十七路廿四路無軌電車、均得在法租界內行駛、法商五路有軌電車及十七·十八·廿四路　無軌電車、亦得駛入公共租界、車票收入、由各該區內公司檢收、雙方並的定如遇有罷工等情、致各路電車不能照舊時路綫行駛時、則所受損失、由發生事故之公可賠償、惟此决罷工事件、兩租界同時爆發、故雙方互不賠償時　損失、</p>
<p>連繫交通</p>
<p>恢復有待</p>
<p>惟兩租界之交通連繫、迄至昨日仍未見恢復、一設車票　人問題、兩公司尙未商妥、一說因英商電車上决怠工事件、尙未全部解決、故兩租界一時尙雖相互通車、惟市民欲由公共租界乘車至法租界、或由法租界乘車至公共租界者、尙須換車、故深感小便、咸盼兩租界電車公司當局、能早日商安通車辦法、以利交通、</p>

<h3>大丈夫應精強力足　……何爲而衰弱無能……</h3>
<p>我們做一個有妻子的丈夫，資任是多麽的重大，不特整個家庭的資任，都放在你的肩上，並且國家興亡，匹夫有責，就是社會國家的責任，也多少總要担負些才好，所以說：大丈夫應當精强力足，奮發有爲，那才能勝任而愉快。果然，一個强壯男子，精力豐沛，他們的夫婦生活，必然圓滿，雙方愛情濃厚，所生子女，是他們唯一的愛情結晶，所組家庭，是他們共有的快樂之窩，因此，他所唯一引爲安慰的是妻兒，還有什麽家累之苦呢？至爲社會服務的職業上亦可以兢兢業業，使工作效力增加，得到豐富的收穫。這樣的丈夫，雖然不能說已做到修身，齊家，治國，平天下的地步，但也可以說盡了他的責任，堪稱爲快樂和幸福的人了。可是男子如果因早年的自凟與遺精，或婚後的荒淫，縱慾與憂勞斵傷之故，致精枯血竭，爆發着腎虧無能，精力渙散，發育不全，機能喪失，以及腦脹頭痛，健忘失眠，腰酸背痛，肢體疲憊等神經衰弱症象。則雖有如花美眷，亦全不發生興趣，但夫婦之道，捨不了靈肉關係，妻子當感覺寂寞之時，懷着滿腔熱情，丈夫若不能予以安慰，她怎能不失望地惱恨呢？在這種情形之下，夫婦間即不免發生一種不快的陰霾，這種陰霾，如不速謀掃除，會逐漸的昏晤下來，把他整個前途的光明和幸福吞沒凈盡！此外，在職業上亦因身體過弱，如何能心計巧算，耐勞克苦，在成功的途徑上邁進？必陷於失業窮困，家累重重！人生至此境地，其困苦之狀，殊有難以言喻者！</p>
<p>但上述病症，並不是不治之症，在今日醫學昌明的世界，更有特效療法，何爲而不知自愛，長此受苦？特效療法，即必須這服生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」，因此劑係由雄壯動物體中提取的生殖腺素所製成，品質純粹，藥性溫和，補力偉大，於服後一日夜問即能生精補腎，健腦活血，滋養神經，若能繼續服用，上述各症必可於短期內完全治愈。惟有遺精者，須兼服「希米脫氏固精片」，以固精關，制止遺洩，則收效允速！</p>
<p>健美</p>
<h3>乳峯萎的悲哀</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士姚崇培</p>
<p>據世界著名的生理學家兼美容專家Kamdeaning康德林，與婦科專家Donpison湯潑遜等在法國最近出版的一份「健康公報』上說「…女性的性情所以會孤僻，容顏所以會憔悴，曲線毫無。而與丈夫不和，或終身不獲一育，　　育而養育困難，這可說與胸前的一對乳峯，有着極大關係，如果聰明的丈夫，能够體會到這些，及時運用進步的醫藥，使他夫人的乳峯高聳而有彈性，那我相信世界上夫婦勃谿的事情，或甚至離婚的事情，一定可以減少，並且還能够多生育幾個活潑伶俐的子女呢』。這段議論，眞是含有至理，有功社會的不朽之作。</p>
<p>按康湯諸氏的所以要這樣重視乳峯，便因爲乳峯高聳而有彈性德女性，他們的卵巢機能必健全，新陳代謝作用必旺盛，所以臀部豐腴，曲線美妙，同時更因血液循環的充暢，容顏自然嬌艷，性情亦復謙和而柔順，此種女性在家底裹每爲丈夫視同壞寳，雙方情愛彌篤，生育還成什麼問題。反之，一個女子而如果乳房萎　，那不管她年紀怎樣輕，大都失去健美幸福，同時並罹白帶及月經不調等症，自然不能生育壯健的子女，甚至喪失受孕的能力，卽使受孕，產生下來的胎兒，非但養育困難，且因母體的衰弱，其死亡也特別容易！</p>
<p>基於這兩個比例，足見乳峯在女性健美上的重要了，然則已有此種缺陷的女性，將怎樣以謀補救呢？余曰：常遵康湯諸氏的建議，運用最新醫藥，最新醫藥爲何？此不待言，卽爲中西醫師一致推荐的卵巢製劑女用「生殖素」了，此劑服後於一日夜間卽能培補卵巢機能，旺盛新陳代謝作用，調整月經，使一切白帶不感，宮冷不姙諸症，似燃犀燭怪，頃刻驅除凈盡，短期內恢復女性應有的健美，而使乳峯高高聳起，姿態動人。</p>
<h3>遺精弊害得嚴重和治療  性病專科醫師詹念曾</h3>
<p>面黃肌瘦的靑年人，據余治病經騐，十個中倒有九個患遺精症，同時在十個遺精患者中，他們的病原，到有九個是起於自凟，自凟是靑年人在春情發動期一種易犯的惡習，起始是因爲體內荷爾蒙的刺激，和好奇心的衝動，但靑年人的意志薄弱，明知其害，而不能制止二次三次的再犯，所以極易造成習慣。以後爲「習慣成自然」的勢力所支配，惡習的改正甚難。及至年齡長大，經屢决的努力，終以戒絕了自凟惡癖，或減少了自凟决數，但性機能已受摧殘，遺精症卽繼之而起。</p>
<p>遺精一起，在我人體內最可寳貴的精液，就等於有了一個不能自主的漏巵。在初症象輕者，每於夜眠時因夢而遺，迨後無夢亦遺，白日亦遺，甚至在大小便時亦有將精液洩出者，這是由遺精加劇而至滑精與漏精了。江河之水雖日日東流，但水有循環，所以無乾涸之處！今以生理上所產生少量的精液，而有如此大量的遺洩，能不枯竭？如精液枯竭，則必百病叢生。其最顯著者爲腦衰體瘦，健忘失眠，心悸胆怯，腰酸背痛，腎虧無能，精力渙散，發育不全等症卽不一而足。此種靑年，如一且結婚，不特在夫婦生活上不能盡其人道，致爲妻憎恨，演出家庭間的悲慘！就是在職業上學術上亦如何能與人競爭，獲得優勝，必處於劣敗地位無疑！然遺精並不是不治之症，在今日昌明的醫藥界上，更有特效良藥的發明，卽患者必須服「希米脫氏固情片」，則遺精卽可根治，如因遺精已引起上述症象者，須兼服生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」以培補腦腎，增益精血，必可於短期內完全恢復健康。若患者能親來本診所就專家醫師診斷後，施附電療，注射，手術等科學療法，必可保證治愈。申報船期表</p>

<p>現棉交易依然平靜如常、但同業心意大都看　、廠方亦無大量的購辦、向海外購訂之棉價、到申每擔可盈利五六十元之譜、近來港幫粗紗需要特旺、故粗紗原料趨昂、平果爾價格本底與十支紗價格比例、相差尙巨、</p>

<h3>粉市明定暗鬆</h3>
<p>麵粉　昨市目華紛廠盤改爲十七元以來、各廠供量稍見增多、且客銷已呆滯多日、人心未免懈怠、故回籠貨雖喊價仍高、已乏相常主顧、洋紛以定貨不機、貨主一味扳俏、聞昨已稍事遷就、計開出高牌十九元五角、中决價在十九元左右、由本街收進四五百包、本街零批華廠粉的計一萬包光景、</p>
<p>小麥　昨日市况、沉靜如故、蓋以國內外來源均寂、運入租界貨、更見寥落、華廠與內地幫因無貨可購、亦不注意收買、除直接解送日廠貨數白包外、其餘概無正式交易、</p>
<h3>證券　怡和啤酒新股　認額至九倍之多　內債已起小回風</h3>
<p>證劵暗盤昨市已起回風、　日來行市逐見漸鬆、各帮多頭漸漸出籠、大都因市價上漲已多、刻下尙在高價、多頭乃把握不定、一方放空者頗不乏人、市價乃緩緩下降、但昨日出進、雙方均屬頗具實力、此種競爭未知鹿死誰手、金子昨雖開做、仍無交易、故公債集會人愈見擁擠、交易仍頗熱鬧也、昨日上午開盤、丙戊兩種卽行打破六十元關、但未久卽行下降、同康買進甚爲踴躍、保昌永康仁昌聯益均有吃胃、裕興鴻大皆有大批賣出、恒孚益昌亦有出籠、午收略小二三角、午後同康繼續買進、但裕與賣出仍湧、加以鴻大賣出亦不少、餘如聯和益昌生大順昌均在隨風賣出、相持甚久、多方乃望風披靡而外、甲種破入八元、乙種破入二元、結果一致續跌六角半至九角半、成交總數仍爲二百五六十萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>倫敦二十三日（週三）電今早國外債及遠東英商各公司股票掛牌行市、仍吿平滯，銀行股獨呈波動、麥加利銀行股上升二先令六便士、價爲七鎊、滙豐銀行英倫註冊股回落一鎊、價爲六十一鎊、叉香港註冊股不動、仍站五十七鎊、有價無市、其餘均無榮辱、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交天廚味精廠股一百股、價爲八十六元五角、</p>
<p>利安洋行發行之怡和啤酒股票五十萬股、計三百萬元、認股款項、計有二千七百萬元、成一與九之比、足徵有資力者吸收外股、亦有鑒於上决信和招股、超出甚多、後來比例分派、故此决　股者預留地步、加額認購、以便分配時多得股份也、</p>
<p>昨日衆業股市仍無多大變動、潛勢則搽、全日成交稀少，蓋因公衆尙具期待心、但各著名股價格一有跌落、多方則動買興、各股中祇會得豐稍有進展、餘均平、橡皮股較黯淡、因投資者正在盼望各公司利息之宣布、以資定奪、此番怡和啤酒公司所招新股極受衆歡迎、逾額認股數的有九倍之多、此點足以顯不目下市鑒流動資金之多爲數實足驚人、故設消息轉佳、此類資金當立可用於市塲投資、反之其抵抗力量亦自雄厚、</p>
<h3>油市　運動到搬出證　油無出路　生豆油小一二元</h3>
<p>昨日食油市况、氣勢漸餒、計交易大有廠豆油百餘担、價爲八十五兀二角半、比上日跌元譜、靑歧豆油成交三十件、價爲七十五元、膠州豆油四十件、價爲七十四元半至七十四元、比較尙平、花生油跌風頗健、現貨挫一二元、期貨猛降三四叫元不等、（計膠州現油二百件、價爲七十元至六十九元、路貨一百件、價爲七十一元、十一月下交三百件、價爲七十二元至七十一元半、十二月上交二百件、價爲七十二元五角至七十二元、靑島油十一月上交五百桶、價爲一百零一元半至九十九元、十一月下交一千二百桶、價爲一百零三元至　百元、及烟台生油五十件、價爲六十九元五角）、原因搬出證　有三千餘件扦出、但內地已被江北油運去解決、故雖搬出證續發、銷塲依然觀望不前、况目成本又遭苛捐而加重、大局何能開展、照現下潛勢、投機反食其果、或可喚醒迷夢、然一部份有力者尙在把持不放、仍在待機而作、</p>
<p>二十五日有豆子二百零五包、豆油一百五十件、芝蔴二百五十包、又蔴油二百聽、生仁五十包、生油二百聽、運往香港、</p>
<h3>糖市　食糖再疲</h3>

<p>廿四日進口糖有四千七百五十包、由杳港來滬、</p>
<h3>金融　現金期做第一天　交易寥落得可憐　午後祗十元上落</h3>
<p>昨日現金蛤赤已照常開做現貨期交、以半月爲期、到期無貨交割、聞可掉換期至月底了結、全日過　、漲後猛跌、市面毫無生氣、交易寥落、全日僅一千餘兩、午後更寂、祇十元上落、結果五千七百六十元、收盤較上週末收軋小七十元、銀樓飾金始終未更、海關金等仍平、</p>
<p>上落在一百餘元</p>
<p>晨初　號帮猛抬、開盤價升至五千八百五十元、銀號首先對做十兩、不久證券帮及銀號抛空、價卽不支而瀉、計銀統出金號廿兩、爲五千七百七十元、後錢兌業略吸、計進銀號十兩、回升至五千八百元、叵奈金號及證券帮力售、缺乏對手、交易轉滯、價亦挫降、證券帮塞予銀號廿兩、低達五千七百五十元、嗣銀號　金號十兩、微漲二十餘元、爲五千七百七十五元、午收銀號對做十兩、僅五千七百六十元、市面靜寂、收盤後亦無上落、下午開盤、錢兌業入銀號十兩、吿五千七百五十五元、檯面更無精彩、進出極微、銀號會對做十兩、又跌爲五千七百五十元、最後銀號向錢兌業進十兩、五千七百六十元、昨晚收價、較上週六收軋跌七十元、全日一百元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價照烚赤較高十餘元、收進减低三十元、現標金掛牌金低五六十元、均鮮做開、</p>

<h3>告上海「二房東」</h3>
<p>— 丁人</p>
<p>「上海居，大不易，」近來爲了「上司」緊迫，大有其「山兩欲來風滿樓」之慨。可是，露宿街頭，生平尙未「領敎」過，不得已，一面祗好咬緊牙關，挺一挺胸，把副沉重的担子—家—挑起來，一面又不得不揀租價低康的房子住。同時，爲了節省車費和一頓中飯錢，又不能不揀鄰近做事的地方。因此，就老在那一帶「兜圈子」</p>
<p>現在找房子，大家都知道是不容易的，所以祇要一見到一張紅紙條，就像獵狗看到兎子般的趕上去，追逐，搜尋，可是，由於這批商人們的「着眼玲瓏」，就偏偏不是召租」而是「廣吿」，於是看的人又是一决垂頭，感到失望。允其是，二房東爲了「奇貨可居」，而廣貼召租，往往是遠在一兩里路以外。二房東的用意不外乎是選擇房客，「待價而沽」，以便敲「他媽的」一筆「竹槓」！</p>
<p>但是，苦了找房子的朋友！二房東在貼召租的時候，爲了廣爲搜羅，等到一旦搜到了「寳貨」，他們却不負責任了，四處貼出去的招租條，從不想到去撕撕掉，累得找房子的人們跑寃枉路的，着實不少，因此，像餓火上升的倒冷飯朋友，碰到空罐頭一樣可恨。</p>
<p>這裏得請二房東們「開開恩一！你們用煤灰塗黑了良心，靠着房子過活不算，還要作弄別人，要知道別人的鞋子襪子，都是用錢買來的，別人的精神，體力，時間，也同樣是無價之寳，不要以爲自己的生活有了着落，就拿尋人開心作消遣，而自己靠在「吃房子」「着房子」上作樂！</p>
<p>請二房東們看看淸楚，這樣的上海，不久將成過去，你們「靠房子」作樂的時候，也將不長了，四週的惡浪，更不允許你長此下去，而支持孤島的倒底還得靠四百多萬的中國同胞，願二房東們及早悔改，以便大家同舟共濟地安渡下去。因爲顧顧六家，也就是顧了自已；面减租减麻煩，是减少了房東房客間的對立，也就是穩定孤島的一股基本力量，盼上海的房東們能揀此上策！</p>

<h3>舞后的歸宿</h3>
<p>— 程小靑著</p>
<p>第十章　皮鞋問題</p>
<p>伊說到這裏，向我瞧瞧。我並不答話，但點點頭，讓伊繼續下去。</p>
<p>伊略頓一頓，接着說：「就在那天—就是前天十七—夜裏，那件不要臉的事就發生了。那時已在半夜後兩三點鐘，我早已睡熱，忽聽得有什麼玻璃東西打碎的聲音。我突然驚醒。接着我叉聽得王小姐的呼叫聲音。我知道不妙，忙從床上起來披了件衣裳，趕到二層樓去。王小姐的房門關着，室中却沒有燈光。我走到伊房門口時，還聽得地板上的脚聲，好像有人在那裏掙扭。王小姐仍在呼叫，不過呼叫聲音很低，好像伊的嘴被什麽東西阻塞着，伊喊叫不出。</p>
<p>「我嚇得什麽似的，要想進去，又沒有道個胆。我以爲也許有什麼强盜或偷兒。我定到伊的房門口，用足了氣力，喊了一聲：『王小姐！』那房門突然開了，有一個男人直衝出來，撞在我的身上，竟使我跌了一交。黑暗中我當然認不出那人是誰，但的略瞧見他穿一身白色的短襯衣，向三層樓奔去。」</p>
<p>「不一回，房間裏電燈亮了，我也從地上爬了起米。李老爺也從三層樓下來，慌忙地走進王小妲房裏去。我也跟着進去，看見王小姐坐在床邊上哭，那件白印度綢的睡衣，前襟也已撕破。粧台上的一隻玻璃花瓶，已打碎在地上，床上的被褥散亂，一隻小方凳也翻倒。</p>
<p>「李老爺拍着王小姐的肩，低聲說：「阿寳，你別哭，這畜生太不要臉，我馬上叫他滾。你看我面上，不要生氣。』主小姐仍掩住了臉啼哭。李老爺也回頭來瞧我。『金梅，你上樓去睡，沒有事。』那時我也說不出什麽話，祇能聽從他，回上三層樓去。我進了自己的房，當然還睡不着。不多一回，又聽得李老爺也回進他的房裏去。他們父子兩個便唧唧噥噥地密談。我的房閒雖和他們祇隔一層板條塗石灰的空壁，但我雖把耳朶湊在壁上，到底聽不出什麼。</p>
<p>「我發覺了這一回事，才知這個表哥不是好人。我防他冉有什麽舉動，這一夜便不敢睡。可是直到天明，沒有其他的動靜。到了昨天早晨七點鐘光景，李老爺陪着他的兒子出去，說是送他兒子上火車回蘇州去的，臨走時，這守琦也不曾向王小姐辭別。其實這時候王小姐的房門還不曾開，也許還睡着呢。」伊說到這裹，又向窗口方面望了一望。</p>

<h3>靑年會少年部錄取免費會員紀聞</h3>
<p>— 晴川</p>
<p>四川路靑年會少年部鑒於目前一般工商界從業員精神上的苦悶和經濟的困難，不能享受業餘的正當消遣和活動，特試辦錄取工商界免費會員，事前知者不多，應試人數共三十四人，雖程度高低互見，有或不符標準者，惟爲鼓勵靑年進取起見，竟全數錄取。此决會試中最可貴的一點，就是在三十餘人的筆底下，流露了他們內心中的眞淸實言，和吿訴我們目前一般工商界以低薪來維持生計的難處。下面是從試卷中得到的一個統計：</p>
<p>年齒：十七歲者二十三人</p>
<p>上六歲者七人</p>
<p>十五歲者三人</p>
<p>十四歲者一人</p>
<p>程度：初中程度十七人（內中一人畢業）</p>
<p>高小程度十四人</p>
<p>初小程度三人</p>
<p>薪給：三十元以下二十元以上者三人</p>
<p>二十元以下十元以上者十一人</p>
<p>十元以下五元以上者十六人。</p>
<p>五元以下者四人</p>
<p>職務：計分雜務，印花，排字，印刷，紀賬，繪圖，打棧單，理貨，書報買賣，打樣，印電影拷貝等十六項。</p>
<p>以上不過舉出了一個大概，讓讀者們知道一些關於爲生計而掙扎的職業靑年的情况。</p>
<p>不滿二十歲的靑年，正當是求知慾特別强的時候，發育也沒有十分的健全，像一朶等待放艷吐香的花，應該愛護牠培養牠，使牠將來結出豐美的果子；可是事實上，有許多爲經濟逼迫的靑年，十多歲就走上店堂或是跑進工廠裹去了！</p>
<p>米珠薪貴的今日，一月祇極但微的收入，供給個人的費用尙且不易，有些還得津貼家庭，供養老母，怎樣能够分配呢？</p>
<p>他們很坦白的指出於待遇的不滿，不只是工資，還有許多應有的業餘福利，他們很希望能够改善。我相信工商界中不乏眼光遠大的人士，能體諒一般職業靑年的苦悶，能多多的同情他們！</p>
<p>凡是人都得生活，並且要過活的生活，才覺得有意義，允其是靑年，思想是活的，動作是活的，不能不使他們得到合理的滿足。靑年會少年部本服務社會爲職志，試辦道决工商界免費會員，使一般心有餘而感力不足的靑年，在業餘之暇，能得到一點精神上的安慰，能和其他會員一樣得到種種應有的亨受。不過道還是初創，以後如果有相當成績，定能多多的招收。</p>
<p>末了，我得誠意的勉勵在苦難中奮鬥的靑年，將來國家社會所需要的一定是我們，決不是迷戀舞塲一揮千金的公子哥兒，努力吧！</p>

<h3>孿生無姊妹開始敎讀</h3>
<p>— 淸暉</p>
<p>光陰似流水般地逝去，一刹那，狄安孿生五姊妹已是學齡兒童了，爲了她們的前途，目前的敎育成爲很重要的一件事，現在就把她們的讀書生活，介紹於後：</p>
<p>學習課程</p>
<p>五姊妹應授的科目，在兩年前，加拿大政府就已規劃好了，現在學習着最重要的一門功課，便是服務。達福醫生吿訴她們唯一信條：「責任第一，私事第二。」雖然他們有著許多看護和傭僕的侍奉，但二椿事情都要自己動手，上課完了要把書籍整理好，課桌要弄得淸　。此外。規定每天授課三小時，對她們的施敎方法着重思想方面，避免呆板式的灌輸，她們喜歡聽神仙故事，更愛繪畫，每週讀英文三决，練習音樂三次，下午是整個的休息和游戲。</p>
<p>敎室佈置</p>
<p>在她們的敎室中，一切佈置，完全照着老威爾斯的器用格式，一套精美的玩具，一條鮮紅的地毯，左壁掛着幾張畫，有一幀，是英皇的禮物，上面畫的是許多小朋友，兎子，松鼠，小烏，野花等那是孩童時代最有趣的世界，右壁上掛着一具時鐘和五姊妹的照片，還有一幅達福醫生的油畫像。最使五姊妹開心的，是那隻奇怪的音樂椅子，當有人坐上去時，會發着可可東東的樂聲。</p>
<p>新懲戒法</p>
<p>過去，因爲五姊妹的年齡還小，所以沒有規定的懲戒辦法。可是現在比較大了，於是特闢了一個「靜室」，這「靜室」長八呎，寬六呎，裏面很光明，空氣也流通，和育養所的其餘各室相同。室內只置一桌一椅，和幾本圖畫書，一切都很舒適，不要使犯過的孩子，獨個兒留在室中，和其餘姊妹隔開，便她感到寂寞，便達到懲戒的目的了。</p>
<p>課外活動</p>
<p>五姊妹很喜歡集團生活，因之她們近來時常舉行一個小小茶話會，座談會，達福醫生在旁做導師的工作，幫助她們智力的進展。在天氣晴朗的時候，達福醫生常常帶孩子們到野外去游玩，他用有趣的方式，故事的體裁，簡單明白地講述大目然的一切，使她們獲得豐富的智識。</p>

<h3>但杜字談　「情人四萬萬」</h3>
<p>（香港通訊）「情人四萬萬」這個動人的片名，曾引起不少熱愛國片的觀衆們所關懷，它究竟是一部粵語片？還是國語片？故事題材又是怎樣？演員陣容以及導演一切等等，中藝社記者特爲此走訪於該片製片主任但杜宇氏，承吿如下：</p>
<p>但氏說：有許多人以爲「情人四萬萬」是一部眼前南國影圈所特別標榜的那些戀情打趣片，或者是包着一些愛國糖衣的輕鬆寫情作品。其實這個片名祇是這部作品中的一支主題歌的歌名，但是整僑的作品却在巧妙的編織下寫出大時代裏四萬萬中華兒女爭取最後勝利的一幕動人故事。作爲這部作品中心的路明小姐，就是這四萬萬中華兒女中的一個「向自由追慕者」的一個代表，這是她到香港來後，第一部國語時裝片，參加演出的都是保有最佳演技紀錄的一羣藝人，如李景波，蔣君超，趙一山，和武漢合唱團的鄭秋子等等。最後但氏又云：胡春冰氏爲這片傾注過無數心血，所以收穫也極　煌。</p>

<h3>「離魂調」與「拉魂腔」</h3>
<p>— 蘇少卿</p>
<p>吾鄕徐州有鄉土小戲，名曰「拉魂腔」者，太的十人爲一班，昔年在村鎭賽會中賣唱餬口，自鐵路通行，徐州車站旁，亦有此輩蹤跡，一人掌鼓板，一人打小鑼，一人打梆子。一人彈長形月琴，二三人扮生丑雜類，亦掛鬚，穿彩衣，惟不穿靴，二三人扮旦角，名曰「包頭」戴假髻子，紙花，搽胭粉，穿女衫女褲，而足下必踩歸，此是特點，此種假金蓮，並不登於歌壇氍毺之上，而行在地上沙土之中，面目黧黑，純悴土風，然其藝術實有獨到之處。所唱故事有祝英台，藍橋會，桃花女等等，吾十年前，曾聽某著名旦角唱桃花女，（卽元曲之「姚花女周公鬥法」）唱法，表情，走像，蹻工，皆臻妙境，大有可觀，所唱調子，卽「拉魂腔」是也，不佞自聽過此腔之後至今念念不忘腔名「拉魂」名副其實，吾之魂，蓋曾被拉了去矣。不料昨日偶然聽到。蘇州女兒唱彈詞，乃又遇「離魂調」，可謂無獨有偶，南北鄕土雖文野不同，而其能「驚心動魄」則一也。今述「離魂調」。</p>

<h3>Secretary of the Navy Knox Declares: US Determined to Defend Overseas Territories, Aid Western Hemisphere Nations in Expanding Armaments, Part of Fleet to Tour Australia and Singapore</h3>
<p>Washington - Secretary of the Navy Knox stated here yesterday that the US Navy is prepared to defend any territory in the world flying the American flag. Secretary Knox believes that assisting other Western Hemisphere nations in expanding their armaments is America's "moral obligation." He declared that the Navy Department has shipped cannons and equipment to several countries, but no US warships have yet been sent to any South American country. Secretary Knox stated, "We cannot neglect the security of any land under the American flag." Knox made this statement in response to inquiries about the Navy Department's intentions regarding the defense of the Philippines and other overseas US territories such as Guam, Midway Island, and Wake Island. Secretary Knox declared, "As long as the flag flies over these territories, the Navy Department must be prepared to defend them." Knox believes the Navy Department is currently planning to strengthen the US Asiatic Fleet. He added that there are no plans to increase naval construction in Cavite and the Philippines. When asked if the Navy Department planned to send reinforcements to the Philippines, Secretary Knox replied in the affirmative. Secretary Knox also stated that the rumors of the US fleet concentrating in Guam were "completely false." As for whether the Navy Department believes the Philippines would be defensible in the event of a war in the Far East, he declined to discuss it, saying that discussing strategy is useless, and stating that the US should defend the Philippines and other US territories. He declined to discuss the rumored transfers of high-ranking Navy Department officials. He stated that the Navy Department currently has no plans to send part of the US fleet on a "goodwill tour" to Australia or Singapore. Observers believe that Knox's remarks imply that part of the US fleet may tour Australia or Singapore. When asked about the near future, he replied that he was "only talking about the present." He added that he had no knowledge of the rumored Navy Department storage of submarine parts in Hong Kong for use in the event of an emergency. Secretary Knox stated that the Navy Department is making very smooth progress in requisitioning merchant ships for use as fleet transports, and that at least twenty-nine ships have been obtained in the past two months. (Associated Press dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>Washington - The United States announced yesterday that it would strongly defend the Philippines as it would defend any state in its own country. The US's new "big stick" policy in the Far East can be reconfirmed by two concurrent measures: first, Secretary of the Navy Knox stated that the US fleet is prepared to meet any threat of aggression against the Philippines; second, the War Department has ordered two powerful air corps, totaling 320 men, to depart for the Philippines within thirty days. One is the 17th Pursuit Squadron, currently stationed at Selfridge Field in Michigan, and the other is the 20th Pursuit Squadron, currently stationed at Hamilton Field in California. Knox expressed the greatest confidence in the current state of the US Navy. He stated, "We can defend any place." He also indicated that the US is close to obtaining more bases in the Pacific, mostly from Britain. (International News Service dispatch, 24th)</p>
<h3>Two US Fighter Squadrons to Reinforce the Philippines, Philippines To Be US Far East Base</h3>
<p>Washington - The US War Department announced last night that two fighter squadrons are now en route to the Philippines to strengthen US Far East defenses. The release of this statement came only hours after Secretary of the Navy Knox stated that the US Navy is prepared to protect any territory flying the US flag. The War Department's statement last night stated that the two fighter squadrons being sent to the Philippines will take off from Selfridge and Hamilton Fields. It is known that Selfridge Field has a total of seven squadrons of aircraft, all of which will be transferred to the Philippines in succession. Before the War Department released this statement, Philippine Resident Commissioner to Washington, Joaquin Elizalde, met with Secretary of War Henry Stimson and reiterated the Philippines' cooperation with the US to protect American interests in the Far East. Once these two aircraft squadrons arrive in the Philippines, the US air strength there will reach a new peak. Recently, the US has repeatedly decided to secretly strengthen the Philippines' air power, and there are already dozens of "flying destroyer" bombers with long-range capabilities in the area. It is believed that the decision to send two more aircraft squadrons to the Philippines is another step in Washington's "silent and swift preparation for action in the Pacific." In the past week, this preparation has included sending huge amounts of naval and land reinforcements to Hawaii and Alaska, and requisitioning large numbers of ships for transportation. Observers also point out that, according to recent news from Manila, US naval aircraft have recently gone to the Philippines in large numbers, so that local workers are temporarily unable to build airfields and barracks to accommodate the pilots and aircraft. Air Force headquarters last night declined to disclose the size of the two aircraft squadrons being sent to the Philippines, but said it was roughly the same as the standard size. It was also learned that Elizalde, during his meeting with Secretary of War Stimson, conveyed President Quezon's promise to cooperate with the US in Far East defense to the US Secretary of War. It is believed that the two men discussed the entire Far East situation in detail, including defense issues. It is said that Elizalde stated that the Philippines has 150,000 trained soldiers available for deployment, and that the US's recent shipment of military supplies to the Philippines is based on the US's recognition that Filipino soldiers are part of the US military in that area. It is believed that the nature of the Philippine representative's meeting with the US Secretary of War is roughly the same as the meeting between US representatives and Philippine defense leaders in the Philippines. According to non-official American military observers, the events of the past week indicate that the US has decided to use the Philippines as a base for US Far East defense. The squadron being transferred from Selfridge Field will depart from San Francisco for Manila on November 20, and the squadron being transferred from Hamilton Field will depart from San Francisco by the end of this month. At the same time, military officials stated here last night that the US defense of the Philippines is not to protect the Filipinos, but to defend the US's important Far East interests. It is said that US authorities rarely discuss actual defense issues with Philippine authorities. (Associated Press dispatch, 24th)</p>
<h3>Entire Western Hemisphere Facing Serious Crisis: Under Secretary of State Welles Urges All Americans to Prepare for Sacrifice</h3>
<p>Baltimore - US Under Secretary of State Welles stated here yesterday that the entire Western Hemisphere is now in grave danger and must be prepared to make the sacrifices necessary for the common good. He reiterated the US government's Good Neighbor Policy of the past eighty years, saying that the complete unity of the Western Hemisphere is the most important thing in history. He stated that the US's Good Neighbor Policy is based on the faithful friendship between the twenty-one republics of North and South America, and that these policies should make it a strong line of defense in the world crisis, and he emphasized that there should be close economic cooperation among the countries of the Western Hemisphere. He believes that the $500 million Export-Import Bank loan is sufficient to enhance the general situation of this cooperation, and stated that US experts are studying the appropriate rubber production so that it will not be necessary to rely on Malaya in the future, and that the government is also striving to plan to increase the production of quinine, ramie, manganese ore, tin ore, and chromite in the Western Hemisphere. Welles said that today, the thoughts and abilities of the US government and people are concentrated on the effective solution of appropriate national defense issues, a situation that is unprecedented. The people of the country should believe that the security of the US has not yet been definitively guaranteed. In order for the US to maintain peace forever, the US should have greater power to deter aggression. In order for US defense to be effective, the implementation of defense cannot be limited to the US mainland, but must enable the US to repel aggression in any part of the New World. If the land of the US's neighbors is not safe, then the safety of the Panama Canal is difficult to maintain, and our country cannot avoid air raids by aggressors. If the US does not have the friendship and cooperation of other countries in the Americas, then plans to defend the Panama Canal, etc., will be difficult to achieve. These facts have become increasingly clear in recent years. "What I want to say today is that this kind of factor is necessary in our country's defense capabilities, in other words, the relationship between us and Pan-Americanism. Eight years ago, governments were making their best efforts to engage in the construction of this Pan-American relationship, and the reason why they did so was because the government had long ago realized that the tragedy of today would occur in the world, and believed that in a world with armed aggression and social revolution, in a world where international law and international morality were about to collapse, one of the great plans to defend our country's peace and security was to establish this kind of relationship with the other twenty republics of the Western Hemisphere, in order to build a strong line of defense in dangerous times. If the situation of the decades leading up to 1933 existed today, then the American people may have encountered the current danger, the New World must have been divided into many parts, and would not have given faith to the US, the Western Hemisphere continent must have suffered from chaos, and if the region, due to extreme economic panic, there was social unrest, it would have lost its track. In a chaos, how could the special commissioners of those omnipotent countries not engage in "fishing in troubled waters"? But today, the understanding and mutual trust between the countries of the Americas have become clear, and have not reached the above-mentioned situation. In the past eight years, the American republics, either through formal agreements or through mutual tacit understanding, have worked hard to achieve the following basic agreements: (1) Each country mutually recognizes each other's sovereignty, equal rights, and inviolability, so that each country constitutes an equal member of the American national society. (2) To resolve disputes that may arise between each other by stipulating agreements on peaceful negotiations, mediation, and arbitration. (3) To jointly decide on matters that threaten the peace, stability, and territorial integrity of any country. (4) Cooperate fully to the extent of each country's capabilities, and in any</p>

<h3>The Nature of Germany's Terms to France</h3>
<p>"France will hand over Vietnam to Japan" – this is one of the seven conditions for peace that Reuters reported yesterday that Germany and Italy recently proposed to the Vichy authorities in France. In addition, one condition is for France to hand over the remaining navy and air force to be dispatched by Germany and Italy. There are also five other conditions related to France's territories and colonies, either ceded, jointly administered, or jointly operated. It is said that if France accepts these conditions and cooperates with Germany and Italy to declare war on Britain, then Germany will immediately return part of the militarily occupied areas to the jurisdiction of the Vichy government. It is also said that after Germany and Italy defeat Britain, when they divide up Britain, they will allow France to share a portion. It is also said that Deputy Prime Minister Laval, Foreign Minister Baudouin, and Naval Minister Darlan in the Vichy organization agree with this approach. Laval is currently traveling between the Vichy authorities and the German authorities in Paris, attempting to bring it about. It is also said that Vichy head of state Pétain, Minister of National Defense Weygand, and others, considering the content of these conditions, believe that the situation Laval wants to bring about will cause France to disintegrate, so they intend to firmly reject these conditions. Under the heavens, all free peoples and republican citizens who cherish freedom and the republican system, and who have any regard for France, where this right and this system originated, are now encountering extreme internal and external adversity, causing the country's fate to plummet to this extreme, will undoubtedly sigh and be heartbroken for it. Although, it is said that this kind of encounter is not a sudden and unexpected cruelty; for Laval, Baudouin, and others, and even Pétain, Weygand, and others, initially shrinking their determination to resist, undermining the public's will to resist, abandoning the weapons of resistance, and alienating the countries allied in the resistance, unconditionally yielding to the enemy, in order to seek so-called glorious cessation of hostilities, then any harsh conditions were all expected. It can be said that it was the case from the beginning, and not cruel today. Although it is said that a partial cession under harsh conditions is still better than unconditional destruction. And although Pétain and Weygand seem to be one better than the Laval types today, but from being cowardly and contradictory and disjointed, how can it be seen that they are slightly better than the Laval types' thoroughness? At the same time, it has been widely rumored that Laval will succeed Pétain as the Vichy head of state. However, we absolutely do not believe that the French culture, material, historical, realistic, and even future prospects, everything, are fatefully destined to only be a dowry for Laval! Could we not view it this way: that France, whether it is Pétain's or Laval's, whether it is German or French, has nothing to do with us. It seems that there is no need to sigh and be heartbroken for it. What we do not believe can also be unexamined. However, feelings and thoughts must be unable to be restrained by those with souls. Moreover, how France's fate will be, is still uncertain, and its rise and fall, survival and death, are related to the world elsewhere, so how can it be ignored? And the fact that Germany and Italy are now, rather than sooner, talking about conditions with France, and that among the seven conditions is "France will hand over Vietnam to Japan," provides important reference material for those who care about world affairs. Since the start of the war, Germany has been victorious in the east, north, and west, and can be said to have won every battle and conquered every fortress. And France's seeking cessation of hostilities under unconditional terms has further contributed to Germany's momentum. Now should be the time for Germany to do as it pleases and carry out its grand ideals. Why, at this time, does it suddenly present conditions to France? Why does it want to determine the entire relationship between Germany and France through partial cession? Why does it want to divide up France's territories and give them to Spain and Japan, saying that it is being generous to others when it is actually what they gained through bloody battles? Why does it give the conquered generals a share of the spoils in the form of IOUs? All these questions, other than seeing it as Germany having realized that it only has Italy as its partner, which is not enough to contend for supremacy, not enough to lead and create the so-called New European Order, so that Spain, which has been in civil strife for years and whose wounds have not yet healed, and the Vichy regime, which is decadent and scattered and clings to the past, and Japan, which is deeply mired and unable to extricate itself, are all on the lookout; in short, in the past, they were confident that they had the power of thunder and lightning and did not see the whole picture, but now they have no choice but to concede even small things. There is no other possible answer to the question. This answer explains how the strengths of the two sides are waning and waxing in the entire international situation and the entire war situation. This waxing and waning must be noted by those who care about world affairs, and this waxing and waning must be a source of joy for anti-aggressionists. As for "France will hand over Vietnam to Japan," on the surface, it is one of the conditions that Germany has only presented today, and that France has not yet accepted. However, Germany and Japan must have exchanged conditions for collusion before allying, and will never complete the deal before negotiating the price. In other words, Germany had already handed over Vietnam to Japan on behalf of France, and does not need to discuss it with France today. Tomorrow, it will wait for France to accept it before handing over and ceding it. It can be seen that what Germany presents to France is actually an order that cannot be disobeyed, at least the one condition regarding Vietnam is an order. In that case, Laval, who is currently traveling, and Pétain and Weygand, who still intend to firmly reject the conditions, are only supporting characters in the drama, or "fools" who are kept in the dark. And all the comings and goings around Haiphong and Hanoi, all the forms of meetings, and the tone of consultation, are only a posture of clever coercion and plunder, only a twist in the plot before the handover and cession. French patriots who are concerned about the times, for the sake of Vietnam, know their best, still want to protect one point, but do not know that they are spiraling between Vichy and Paris, and do not know how to jump out of the pot, and this is the most sighing and heartbreaking.</p>

<h3>Hendaye, a Town on the Franco-Spanish Border; Heads of Germany and Spain Meet; The Meeting Lasted Two Hours and Both Foreign Ministers Participated; Spain and France Join the Axis Powers</h3>
<p>Hendaye. Hendaye is a picturesque town located at the mouth of the Bidassoa River. The German head of state, Hitler, yesterday conducted a meeting here with General Franco, the leader of Spain. Hitler's special train arrived at the Hendaye station first, and Franco's special train arrived shortly after. Hitler, accompanied by Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, disembarked, followed by General Brauchitsch, Commander-in-Chief of the Army, and General Keitel, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces. They inspected the guard of honor and a battalion of the Spanish Army in front of the station. The station was decorated with German and Spanish flags. A few minutes later, Franco's special train pulled into the station platform, and the military band played the Spanish national anthem. The guard of honor presented arms. General Franco, accompanied by Foreign Minister Suñer and General Moscardó, the defender of the Alcázar, arrived at the same time. The two leaders exchanged greetings, and Hitler introduced his accompanying officials to Franco. They then proceeded to inspect the guard of honor. Hitler then led General Franco into a specially prepared conference car for a two-hour meeting, which was also attended by the German and Spanish foreign ministers. In the evening, General Franco hosted a banquet. It is expected that the meeting concluded late last night. (Haitong dispatch of the 24th)</p>
<p>Berlin. Regarding the outcome of the meeting between Hitler and Franco in Hendaye last night, this agency has received the following additional information. Last night, Franco accepted Hitler's invitation to dinner in his train. Key German and Spanish figures participated. After the discussions, Hitler and Franco reviewed the guard of honor again. Then, Hitler escorted his guest to the door of the special train to say goodbye. As Franco's train left the station, the military band played the Spanish national anthem. (Haitong dispatch of the 24th)</p>
<p>Berlin. This morning's German newspapers only published brief official reports and supplementary notes on the meeting between Hitler and Franco, and some morning newspapers did not even publish this important news. Only the Völkischer Beobachter and the Berliner Börsen-Zeitung published the official report and pointed out the significance of the Hitler-Franco meeting on the front page, but without further comment, only urging the German people to pay attention to this important meeting. (Haitong dispatch of the 24th)</p>
<p>Madrid. Last night, the German leader Hitler and General Franco held a meeting on the Franco-Spanish border in order to quickly bring France and Spain into the Axis powers and control the western Mediterranean and Northwest Africa. Some believe that this important meeting of the two dictators will bring about an unexpected turning point in the European war. Some believe that this move may involve "plundering France," that is, occupying Gibraltar and preventing the Allies from entering the Mediterranean from the west. (International dispatch of the 24th)</p>
<p>Madrid. People in Madrid were discussing the Hitler-Laval meeting last night. Madrid newspapers prominently published this important news this morning, and evening newspapers reported on the meeting on the front page. All newspapers headlined the French official report as "a major event since the Franco-German armistice." The Pueblo newspaper commented, "A major political and military event after the Brenner Pass meeting has begun to be announced. The new situation created by Britain's attitude towards France, Britain's desire to expand the conflict, and the justifiable desire to attack the German Empire has become a topic of discussion among international figures. In short, the new events and dangers that should occur during the war against Britain have arrived." (Haitong dispatch of the 24th)</p>
<p>New York. The New York Times' Berlin correspondent reports that the German newspapers are not allowed to publish a single word about the Hitler-Franco meeting beyond what is stated in the communiqué. However, neutral diplomats in Berlin believe that the importance of the current diplomatic changes has exceeded the importance of attacking Britain, and the military center has now shifted to the Mediterranean, making the attack on Britain a secondary goal.

<p>Hitler Hopes Spain</p>
<p>Will Abandon its Policy of Non-Intervention</p>
<p>London. A Reuters correspondent reports that London is not surprised by the news that Hitler and Foreign Minister Ribbentrop have arrived on the Franco-Spanish border to meet with Franco and Spanish Foreign Minister Suñer, and considers this to be another trick by the Germans. Originally, the Germans wanted to discuss political matters during Suñer's vacation in Germany, but this was not kept secret and was revealed early. Suñer kept his scheduled vacation dates, returning home after the vacation was over. Thus, he could only discuss internal affairs and inspect the Nazi system during his travels, but did not have time to represent the government in discussing political matters. The Germans were, of course, annoyed by this. The Germans clearly intend to make Spain more closely aligned with the Axis powers, and still hope to discuss this matter with Spain. This is proven by Hitler's visit to the Franco-Spanish border. Hitler may believe that his personal and direct contact with Franco will eliminate the difficulties previously encountered by his foreign ministers, and that Franco will be moved by his personal visit and will no longer insist on the non-intervention policy that best suits Spain's true interests. To achieve this goal, Hitler did not hesitate to abandon his usual practice of summoning politicians from other countries and risked a long journey and damage to his dignity if he failed.

<p>Spain's Future Mission</p>

<p>Berlin. Informed German sources today suggested that after the Hitler-Franco meeting in Hendaye, Spain and France are being rapidly brought into the Axis group as non-belligerent countries. They also hold the view that Spain's mission and purpose in the Axis powers' "New Order" plan will be clarified, and after clarification, they can appeal to the Portuguese-speaking countries of South America, giving the United States a new warning not to "unnecessarily support a defeated Britain."

<h3>Hitler Prepares for</h3>
<p>A Meeting with Pétain; It Is Reported that Germany Proposed to Laval</p>
<p>The Cession of Northern Morocco to Spain</p>
<p>Vichy. According to Italian newspaper reports, Italian Foreign Minister Ciano is preparing to go abroad on a secret mission, but it is not clear whether he will meet with Laval. Observers believe that Laval's meeting with Hitler is entirely preparatory, with Hitler expressing his willingness to meet with Pétain. It is reported that one of the topics discussed by the two leaders will be the issue of ending the state of war between the two countries. It is said that the release of 1.8 million French prisoners was among the subjects discussed by Laval and Hitler. It is reported that the meeting between Laval, Hitler, Ribbentrop, and Pétain was at Hitler's invitation and would be held as soon as possible after the talks between Hitler and Laval. In a statement to the Associated Press reporter, French Foreign Minister Baudouin stated, "I believe that France plans to declare war on Britain." He said, "I authorize you to issue a statement that the intention of French military action was not included in the meeting between Laval and Hitler." The statement was issued after Baudouin's meeting with Marshal Pétain, because rumors were circulating that the meeting between Laval, Hitler, and Ribbentrop was Hitler's request for the French fleet to join the war against Britain. (Associated Press dispatch of the 24th)</p>
<p>Vichy. Hitler's far-reaching proposals for the range outlined in Europe and the Mediterranean bring today's France closer to the moment of her fate. The leaders of this conquered country discussed Nazi peace terms until late last night. Marshal Pétain, the veteran of the World War known as the "Verdun Meuse," now the Prime Minister of the defeated country, may be about to meet Hitler in person. (International Press dispatch of the 24th)</p>
<p>Madrid. According to the Zürich newspaper Volksrecht, Germany proposed to French Deputy Prime Minister Laval that France cede French Morocco north of the Spanish zone to be used for an offensive against Gibraltar. This is receiving close attention here. The Zurich newspaper also said that the Nazi plan caused a serious split in the Vichy government. French Prime Minister Pétain and most people oppose the German demands, while Deputy Prime Minister Laval, Foreign Minister Baudouin, and Naval Minister Darlan support Hitler's peace plan. It is said that General Weygand, the commander of French defense in Morocco, is also among the opponents. The immediate participation of France and Spain in the European war seems to be rapidly approaching. Hitler will personally command the Axis powers to attack southwestern Europe after the German army enters Romania and advances from east to west. (International dispatch of the 24th)</p>
<p>Laval Returns to Paris Again</p>
<p>Vichy. After meeting with German leader Hitler, Cabinet Associate Laval returned here this afternoon and immediately met with leader Pétain to report on the proceedings. He then hurriedly left for Paris. Various circles here are commenting on this. It has been rumored that these things happened three days ago, but officials have not made any indications. Although the responsible parties are still keeping silent, they also admit that this matter is very important regarding the "future of France". Regarding the various reports published in foreign newspapers, they are undoubtedly confirmed, but the responsible parties point out that some of the news are groundless rumours, and advise the public not to make rash speculations. In short, the talks between Associate Laval and leader Hitler are based on the fundamental concept of Franco-German cooperation, but what the two discussed is still unknown. In addition, Foreign Minister Baudouin yesterday made a statement to American journalists that the hatred between France and Germany must be eliminated. Although this statement is based on Pétain's recent letter to the French people, it has nothing to do with the travels of Associate Laval, but it is enough to express the direction of France's current policies.

The semi-official Stefani News Agency has issued a dispatch from Berlin stating that American newspaper reporters stationed in Germany have been issuing news on the meeting between German leader Hitler and French Cabinet Associate Laval, making various guesses about the content of the talks. German officials consider it to be "a kind of political espionage" and have issued a warning to them, telling them not to think of themselves as "observers of the enemy of the Axis powers."

<p>Political Offensive by the Axis Powers</p>
<p>Zurich. The Basel newspaper in Switzerland last night sent a correspondent from Berlin reporting another reason for the meeting between Hitler and Laval. It is said that this meeting is a major political offensive by the Axis powers to make it impossible for the United States to participate in the war before the US presidential election. German newspapers are now using the same means to induce Spain, believing that if France can be induced to join the German side in the war, Spain will have no choice but to stay out of it. Therefore, something must happen before the US presidential election to ensure that the US cannot participate. (Reuters dispatch of the 24th)</p>

Another powerful writer, Anfkan, also said, "Those who try to enter our country to achieve their goals will suffer serious losses. This is the position of the Turkish people and cannot be decided by the government." The semi-official Ankara newspaper Ulas also wrote, warning, "Turkey is now in a dark, uncertain dispute in the world, which may one day cause us to bear great hardship, but the more difficult things are, the more determined our determination is, and all our courage will enable us to complete our cause."

<h3>羅斯福　競選演說</h3>
<p>Philadelphia Yesterday, President Roosevelt delivered his first primary election speech here, reaffirming his promise to ensure that the United States does not participate in foreign wars. He also denounced the Republican Party's use of dictatorial methods in an attempt to make him fail in the election. He stated that he felt the time had come to respond to the Republican accusations. For several years, every action, every thought of mine, has been aimed at maintaining world peace, and I have strived even more for the peace of the United States and the Western Hemisphere. Whenever war seemed imminent, I have not hesitated to use every ounce of power of the President of the United States to avoid war. And when war has started, I have exhausted all my efforts to prevent its spread and to strengthen national defense for my own country. All of these are the best guarantees of peace and security. I finally declare that I stand on my own position, and we will not participate in foreign wars unless attacked by others, nor will we spare any effort of the army and air force in combat. What I have always strived for is peace. Only for peace will I dedicate myself to the utmost until death. (United Press, 24th)</p>

<h3>英德空軍活動漸和緩　少數德機襲倫敦未逞　英機羣續炸柏林等處</h3>
<p>London After a relatively quiet night, Londoners were awakened again this morning at 5 a.m. by the sound of anti-aircraft fire and sharp alarms, forcing them to take refuge in air-raid shelters, the 251st time they had sought shelter since the start of the war. Last night's German air raid began at 7 p.m. This raid was the earliest that the Germans had tried to attack London in the 17 consecutive days of attacks. The number of planes seemed to be fewer than usual, perhaps due to bad weather. German planes attempted to break through the London defense line from two locations, but were repelled by British anti-aircraft fire. A lone Nazi plane cut off its engine and glided in the darkness, attempting to penetrate the heart of London. This lone night hawk dropped two bombs and then escaped. The air-raid alarm sounded twice in London during the day. (International Telegraph, 24th)</p>
<p>London An Air Ministry communiqué stated that yesterday, German aerial activity was limited to a few planes carrying out individual attacks, dropping bombs on a town on the south coast and two locations in the London area. Apart from a slight number of casualties at a factory in the London area, there were no deaths or injuries elsewhere. A town in East Midlands and the Kent area were also bombed, causing damage to buildings and some deaths and injuries, although not many. (Reuters, 24th)</p>

<p>London According to a joint communiqué issued by the Air Ministry and the Ministry of Home Security, German planes began attacking London shortly after dusk yesterday and continued into the night, with some interruptions, but on a small scale. Buildings and shops in several locations were hit and damaged. No major damage was reported until 5:30 a.m. There were also few casualties. A town in northeastern England was bombed, damaging houses and causing some deaths and injuries. Several locations in southern Scotland were also affected, but the damage and casualties were very slight. Although enemy planes appeared elsewhere, they did not drop bombs. (Reuters, 24th)</p>

<p>London The Air Ministry announced that British bombers attacked targets in the Berlin area last night, causing fires and explosions. Another squadron of British planes concentrated on bombing the railways, docks, and storage facilities in Emden harbor. Other targets in Germany and occupied areas that were bombed included oil depots in Hanover, freight yards east of Berlin, and several German airfields. Only one British plane was lost.

<h3>希特勒侵英準備　遭受嚴重打擊　英航空部發表詳情</h3>
<p>London The government disclosed details of Hitler's preparations for the invasion of England last night. According to the Intelligence Department of the Air Ministry, only a portion of these details can be disclosed at present. From the first day that the enemy began to assemble troops at the ports and harbors they occupied, the Royal Air Force began reconnaissance. According to reconnaissance reports from British planes in early September, the number of troops and materials concentrated by the enemy was still small, but it increased day by day thereafter. Before long, hundreds of flat-bottomed boats and other war equipment were assembled in Antwerp, Calais, Dunkirk, Ostend, Nieuwpoort, and Havre. Aerial reconnaissance also revealed many flat-bottomed boats moving slowly back and forth in the canals, with small warships moving nearby. These flat-bottomed boats are self-propelled with engines, and are over 150 feet long, capable of carrying two train carriages' worth of soldiers and supplies. The Germans also emptied out five hundred-ton flat-bottomed boats and hired workers to modify the front of these ships to make it easier to load and unload tanks and artillery. In addition, submarines (including giant ocean-going submarines), giant motorboats, tugs, and merchant ships were also berthed in many ports. At one time, 45 large merchant ships were berthed in Havre harbor. In the interior, many airfields are being constructed, with new underground hangars, where aircraft will assist in the invasion of England. Railway traffic is also unusually frequent, especially railway transport between Germany and the Netherlands and Belgium. On September 5, the Royal Air Force launched a strong offensive, bombing the invasion bases one by one. The naval docks and shipyards in Kiel and Bremen in Germany were bombed, and the occupied ports along the Dutch and Belgian coasts were also attacked and severely damaged. The enemy forces in Cherbourg were suddenly attacked by the British naval and air forces a few days ago, and they were caught off guard. The coastal defenses there did not seem to be prepared to retaliate. After the British forces had finished bombing and withdrew, the enemy's heavy artillery began to fire back at the British ships. As it stands, the threat of invasion of England still exists. As long as there are warships, flat-bottomed boats, troops, and aircraft assembled along the long coastline of the occupied areas, this threat will not be eliminated for a day. Therefore, the Royal Air Force will continue to strike at the "invasion ports" whenever it deems necessary. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<h3>德軍戰報</h3>
<p>Berlin This afternoon's German war report stated that due to inclement weather yesterday, the activities of the German air force were limited to bombing several factories in London and central England, in addition to aerial reconnaissance.

Enemy warships attempting to approach the Flanders coast under cover of heavy fog were all repelled by German coastal artillery fire. Last night, British planes flew over German territory, attempting to bomb Berlin. Only a few reached Berlin's airspace. The incendiary bombs they dropped mostly landed in residential areas. Although several fires broke out, they were quickly extinguished. One German factory was hit by a bomb, causing slight damage. One German plane is missing. (Haitong Telegraph, 24th)</p>

<h3>英軍管轄　西奈半島　埃軍奉命撤退</h3>
<p>Athens According to news from Cairo, the Egyptian Sinai Peninsula, Quqa, Dachila, Bahari, Siwa and other places were placed under the jurisdiction of the British military authorities yesterday. The Egyptian garrisons in each area have been ordered to withdraw within one week. The Cairo newspapers believe that this change in the territorial status of Egypt is only administrative in nature. In fact, placing the various regions under British military administration is tantamount to forcibly changing the constitution, because the special border administrative chiefs of each region are personally appointed by the King of Egypt. Saudi Arabia attaches great importance to this matter and believes that British motorized troops will replace the Egyptian army and be stationed in the Gulf of Aqaba. It was rumored in Cairo yesterday morning that British motorized troops had clashed with Arabs in the Outer Nile region. According to news from Alexandria, a large number of Arabs near Suez were arrested for being involved with the Pan-Arab anti-British Committee. (Haitong Telegraph, 24th)</p>

<h3>溫莎公的新職</h3>
<p>The "Lady Somers", sailing from Bermuda to the Bahamas, arrived in the capital Nassau on the morning of August 17. Apart from the Duke and Duchess of Windsor and their entourage taking up their new posts, there was only one passenger on board. At 9:15 a.m., the Duke and his party disembarked, walked down the gangplank, landed at the St. George's Wharf, passed through Rawson Square, and went to the Parliament House in Government House, where the oath of office ceremony was held. The black natives on the island were extremely excited to hear that "the King" - they did not yet know that he had abdicated - had arrived. Thousands of men, women and children, young and old, were waiting at the dock and along the route that the Duke and Duchess passed. These blacks, barefoot, cheered loudly to show their respect when they saw the Duke of Windsor and his party passing by. The lively scene was several times more lively than in Bermuda. The only thing that was the same was that the Duchess was still wearing the same dress.</p>
<p>From the wharf to the Parliament House, the streets were decorated with colored streamers, and the ships in the harbor were also flying flags to celebrate, and there were large welcoming banners. One of the banners read: "Columbus, 1492; Duke of Windsor, 1940." The natives' enthusiastic welcome was evident.</p>
<p>Three hundred people, all wearing formal attire or military uniforms, participated in the Duke of Windsor's inauguration ceremony. The weather was hot that day, and the sun was scorching. It was really hot in this tropical area. The guests were sweating, and the audience was bored. The Duke of Windsor, wearing a yellow lieutenant-general's uniform, entered the hall after his wife was seated. The Duchess's long skirt swayed, and she was dignified and graceful. She sat in a seat one level lower than the Duke of Windsor's seat, but one level higher than the seat of the previous Governor's wife. Because it was hot, she lightly fanned herself with a precious fan from time to time.</p>
<p>Opposite the Duchess of Windsor's seat was a huge portrait of Queen Mary of England, more than ten feet high. It was magnificent, dignified, kind and peaceful, and inspired respect. When the time for the ceremony arrived, the Duke of Windsor stood under the red canopy with the royal crown emblem, looking slightly trembling and uneasy. He then reached into his left sleeve and took out a handkerchief. At this time, Colonel Lindop recited the letter of appointment in a loud voice. This was followed by the Chief Justice Darley, wearing a wig and robe, administering the oath.</p>
<p>Opposite the Duke of Windsor was a huge mirror, with a snow-white ceiling above it. Windsor's every move was reflected in the mirror. At this time, he restrained his smile and looked very serious. Then, the Chief Justice read out the following oath intermittently: "I, Edward Albert Christian George Andrew Patrick David, Duke of Windsor, do solemnly swear to faithfully and sincerely serve King George and his descendants and successors according to law, so help me God." From Edward onwards, those were all the Duke of Windsor's names. It can be said that the roll call was complete.</p>
<p>After the oath, the Duke of Windsor signed the document with a specially made tortoise-shell pen and continued to take the oath of office. The first part was the same as the oath mentioned above, and the concluding words were: "I will serve King George with all my heart in my capacity as Governor and Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy in the Bahamas." After signing for the second time, the Duke of Windsor straightened his body, looked at his wife, and listened to the speeches of Speaker Moore and Councilor Johnson.</p>
<p>After the speeches, Windsor gave a reply. He did not have a written speech, but simply gave a few words that he had prepared on the ship. First, he thanked those who welcomed him and described his journey. Then, he hoped to do his best during his term of office. Finally, he said: "The Bahamas, like other British colonies, has been affected by the war and is seeking a solution to its difficulties. Regardless of how long I am in office, I will do my best to work together to find a solution. The Duchess and I are very happy to be here in this island. The warm welcome we received from the people of Nassau is something we are very grateful for. We will be living here afterwards, and there will be many opportunities for good relations, etc."</p>
<p>After the speech, everyone cheered three times, and then the couple began to shake hands with many white and black people in the audience. It was also a bitter task for the Duchess to shake hands with three hundred guests in the hot weather, but they smiled and enjoyed it. One of the female guests curtsied to the Duchess. Another female guest wanted to imitate her, but changed her mind and did not do so.</p>
<p>It was just past ten o'clock when the Duke and Duchess stood on the balcony and waved to the people to express their gratitude. At this time, the open space in front of the Governor's gate was filled with natives who came to admire the Duke and Duchess's demeanor, and they cheered loudly to show their respect. Finally, the band played the British national anthem. The Duke of Windsor raised his hand to salute in the solemn atmosphere. The inauguration ceremony was completely over, and the Duke and Duchess drove to the government residence to rest and enjoy cold drinks.</p>
<p>The Duchess's graceful figure was charming and moving. She was originally a beautiful woman. In addition, she was well-dressed and good at dressing herself up. In this island of Bahamas, she appeared like Chang'e descending from heaven, giving people a refreshing feeling. A few days after her husband took office, a banquet was held in the Governor's House. As the hostess, the Duchess had to dress up in gorgeous clothes to entertain the guests. However, there was no luxurious beauty salon on the island for the Duchess to use. She had to send a telegram to a French barbershop in New York, asking them to send the famous barber Folyeth to Nassau to give her a perm and makeover. The barber received the telegram and did not dare to delay. He brought a hair dryer, rouge, powder, nail polish, lipstick and other cosmetics, and flew to the Bahamas within 24 hours. This extravagant act of the Duchess is probably hard to find a second person in the world.</p>
<p>It has been 200 years since the Governor was established in the Bahamas, and the official residence where the Duke and Duchess of Windsor live is also an old house, which is 110 years old. A wife as fond of beauty as the Duchess would of course want to renovate the old house. Unfortunately, during this period of national crisis, all expenses cannot be abundant. The Bahamian Parliament only approved US$8,000 for the house repairs. The Duchess therefore had no choice but to proceed in an economical way. The Duchess's friend, Lady Mountail, has been ordered to work together to plan the renovation of the house.</p>
<p>The new Governor and his wife live in a residence built in 1801, with seven bedrooms, six bathrooms, and twenty-four other rooms. These include the Executive Council Chamber, the Private Secretary's Office, and a large ballroom. Currently, the furniture in the main living room has been repainted in rose-Queen Mary of England's favorite color. The ten-foot-high portrait of the Queen Mother in the dining room was her bridal attire when she married the late King George V. There were originally six servants in the official residence, and they remain the same. However, the new Governor and his wife will add a few more.</p>
<p>This official residence is quite spacious, but it is a bit old. The previous Governor had built a new house on a high ground with beautiful scenery and requested the Parliament to allow him to move the official residence in, but it was rejected. If the Duke of Windsor wants to move the official residence, I am afraid the result will be the same. Before the previous Governor, all previous Governors who requested to move or increase their salaries were rejected in the same way. Windsor's deputy, Du Lay, spent the winter in Nassau last year and has already found two villas by the beach that can be used for the Duke and Duchess to rest. In the future, the social customs of Nassau society may also change from this. (The End)</p>

Social sports and other types of proposals were carefully discussed and completed. A telegram of respect to Chairman Lin and Chairman Jiang, as well as a telegram of condolence to the front-line soldiers, were approved. The closing ceremony was held at 3:00 PM. Director Shang Zhen of the Military Affairs Commission Office, Deputy Minister Pan Gongzhan of the Central Political Department, President Ye Yuanlong of Chongqing University, and more than a hundred members attended. Chairman Gu gave a closing speech, stating, "This National Education Conference has brought together education administration officials at all levels, representatives of relevant departments, and experts in education and sports to jointly discuss how to promote national sports and how to promote national health, so as to complete the great cause of resistance and national construction. The conference has now made concrete decisions, and I hope that we will make unremitting efforts in this direction." He continued, "The convening of the National Sports Conference is truly to meet the needs of the current era of resistance and construction. I deeply hope that the people of the whole country will follow the instructions of President Jiang and pay more attention to and work harder on national sports. I also hope that the participants will return to their respective regions, taking schools as the center or agencies as the starting point, to promote national sports in all aspects." Then, Director Jin, Director of the Department of Health, and Deputy Minister Pan of the Central Propaganda Department were invited to give speeches. Finally, the chairman read the conference declaration before the meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>Full Text of the Declaration</p>
<p>A nation has three foundations: education, economy, and military. This is the path that President Chiang has instructed us to strive for in national construction, and education is one of the main links. As for the educational policy, the President has further clarified the meaning of "equal emphasis on literature and martial arts, and equal importance to both technique and ethics" to eliminate the bias of the times. We, in the education sector, should diligently uphold it and never forget it. The holding of the National Sports Conference coincides with the National Day of the fourth year of the War of Resistance, and it takes place in the accompanying capital leading the national resistance. Looking outward at the increasing spread of the world war, and inward at the approaching victory of the War of Resistance, every time we think of the President's instructions, we feel more keenly the importance of the responsibilities that we in the education sector, especially we in the sports sector, bear for the War of Resistance and national construction, and we are awed by the fact that our mission may not be fully accomplished. After careful discussion, we would like to mention the main points of the resolutions to our compatriots across the country:</p>
<p>I. Establish the Direction of the National Physical Fitness Implementation Plan</p>
<p>In ancient education, in addition to the six arts of writing, arithmetic, etc., rites, music, archery, and charioteering were all related to physical education. Indeed, if the physique is not strong, self-defense is difficult, let alone defending the country. Therefore, the implementation of national physical education should aim to enhance the physical strength of the people and realize the purpose of national education. It is essential that all citizens have the obligation to receive physical education training, and also that everyone has the right to enjoy sports. Only in this way can physical education be truly universal and democratized, and the foundation of a strong nation will be established and unshakable. Moreover, physical education is not only about enhancing the physical strength of the people, but also the result of enhancing physical education can enrich people's lives, support the survival of society, enrich the people's livelihood, and continue the life of the nation. Therefore, the implementation of national physical education is by no means aimed only at a few individuals, but in fact targets all citizens of the country at all times and in all places. In other words, it is aimed at the entire nation. We only hope that the education sector across the country, under the established direction, will adapt to the times, adapt to local conditions, adapt to people, and adapt to circumstances, strive forward, and converge on the same goal. Then, the great results can be expected.</p>
<p>II. Cultivate Sports Teachers and Encourage Academic Research</p>
<p>The advancement and expansion of sports depend on the cultivation of sports talents, and academic research is also indispensable. For a fundamental solution, the central government should plan to establish a five-year sports normal college, and each province and city should establish sports normal schools or sports normal departments to cultivate a large number of sports teachers for secondary and primary schools. At the same time, cultivate cadres for national sports. For a temporary solution, all sports colleges or sports normal schools, as well as all schools with sports departments, should, in light of the needs of national education, establish various sports training classes to alleviate the current shortage of sports talents. The state should give special encouragement to those who have special research in sports academics and have achieved definite results. All methods that can encourage research in sports, such as establishing sports research institutes, sending sports students abroad, compiling and translating sports books and newspapers, and experimenting with sports teaching materials, should be organized by the government and society to the best of their ability, so that the general public's concept of sports becomes increasingly correct and their interest in sports becomes increasingly strong. Then, the progress of national sports will surely be achieved with half the effort and twice the result.</p>
<p>III. Improve and Promote School Sports and Community Sports</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education has previously promulgated the implementation plan for sports in schools at all levels and the provisional minimum standards for sports equipment in schools at all levels. Now, in order to effectively implement it, the progress should be clearly defined and completed within a time limit, so that school sports will not become empty talk on paper. The measurement of the physique of primary and secondary school students and the testing of sports skills should also be completed as soon as possible so that they can be used as a basis. Based on scientific methods and statistical principles, sports performance scales for various sports should be formulated separately according to the age and gender of students at all levels. This is in terms of school sports. As for community sports, people in general, ordinary young men, community youth, or civil servants, etc., should be treated according to their respective characteristics and appropriate sports facilities should be determined. All schools, sports fields, or natural environments that can be used as places for the public to practice sports should be used as much as possible to achieve the universality of sports implementation. At the same time, formulate national sports performance testing standards to show role models, and use various methods to create a social atmosphere that values sports and enjoys exercise, so that the physique of the general public can reach this standard. For example, designating September 9th as National Sports Day is one way to create an atmosphere. For the purpose of observation and research, a central sports and health museum should be established to collect specimens, materials, statistical charts, etc. related to sports and health, so that the people of the country can know where our physical shortcomings lie, and work together to transform them to achieve progress. This is most important to national sports, and we hope to strive for its realization with all our strength.</p>
<p>IV. Improve Health Education, Traditional Chinese Martial Arts Education, and Scouting Education</p>
<p>Sports and hygiene are essentially one, so when talking about sports, we must pay attention to health education. In terms of organization, the central government's competent authority for health education was originally the Ministry of Education, supplemented by the Ministry of Health. The administration of health education is the responsibility of the Ministry of Education, while its equipment and technology are the responsibility of the Ministry of Health. In each province and city, the Education Department should set up a health education committee to take charge of it. In short, it is essential to make sure that both sports and health education are effectively linked together to achieve the practical effect of enhancing national physical strength. Traditional Chinese martial arts are a method of physical exercise unique to our country and should be included as a path in the sports teaching materials of schools. The Ministry of Education should organize a national martial arts teaching materials review committee to formulate teaching materials and complete them within a time limit. At the same time, set up national martial arts training centers everywhere to cultivate teachers who train in national martial arts. As for the content and methods of scouting courses, they should also be revised to be more practical. We hope to vigorously promote social scouting to meet actual needs, so that scouting is not just a finishing touch in schools.</p>
<p>V. Improve the National Sports Administrative Organization</p>
<p>Since national sports are valued by the general public, the administrative organization in charge of this undertaking should have a clear system. The Ministry of Education should be the competent authority at the central level, and sports officials in other relevant agencies should have closely linked organizations. The administrative organization in charge of sports in the Ministry of Education should set up a department to take full responsibility for the promotion of national sports. Each province, city, and county should also have a section or division, or responsible personnel, to take charge of this undertaking. The system of sports supervision and inspection should be actively implemented, so that all sports facilities can be practical and realistic, and funds are not wasted. To enrich the establishment of sports venues and the mass production and low-price supply of sports activity tools are necessary conditions for the widespread promotion of national sports, and it goes without saying.</p>
<p>In short, the main purpose of our promotion of national sports in the future is definitely not to beautify the facade, and it is definitely not like competitive performance, but to regard it as a fundamental work to restore the decline of the nation and rise again. Therefore, it is recognized as one of the main undertakings of the education sector. Only in this way can we expect to see the effects of actively implementing national sports: first, the general public should have a physique that meets health standards; second, they should have the skills to defend themselves and the country; third, they should have the habits of serving, helping each other, being orderly and solemn; and fourth, they should have the qualities of being cultured, self-restrained, and cooperative. Only in this way can the minimum standards for the implementation of national sports be said to have been achieved. Only in this way can education achieve the effect of combining literary and military skills and cooperate with military and economic forces to complete the great cause of national construction. We are determined to encourage ourselves with this, and we encourage the people of the country to do the same.</p>

<h3>Bishop Ward Returns to Shanghai after Touring America: Talks about America's Preparation for War: Solid Economy, Advancing Production Capacity: Sufficient to Cope with Simultaneous Warfare in Both Oceans: Startling Changes in People's Attitudes towards European and Asian Wars</h3>
<p>According to the Western newspapers, Bishop Ward of the Methodist Church in America recently returned to China after his vacation in America. He departed from San Francisco, traveled to Japan, stayed for a few days, and then took the President Coolidge steamer to Shanghai, arriving on the morning of the 23rd. Bishop Ward declined to comment on the situation in Japan, but he described in detail the impressions he gained from his observations in the United States to news reporters.</p>
<p>America is Almost</p>
<p>Inevitable in War</p>
<p>In the past six months, America's attitude towards the wars in Europe and Asia has undergone startling changes. American public opinion is now prepared to fight simultaneously in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. Americans certainly do not want war, but most people believe that America is inevitable in war. The American government and people have recognized the current problems and crises and are prepared to act in unison to deal with everything. America's war preparations are becoming increasingly substantial. Various basic industries have only utilized 60% to 70% of their production capacity for several years, but now they are catching up rapidly and have reached 90% or even 100%.</p>
<p>Military Build-up</p>
<p>United in Purpose</p>
<p>The stock market is exceptionally stable and strong. Any surprising new developments in the international arena only cause a slight fatigue. The incidents that have occurred abroad and the mutual collusion of various forces have long been anticipated. The United States, both upper and lower levels, is not surprised. Moreover, the actions of the United States in finance and politics have a definite course of action. On the one hand, tens of billions of dollars are allocated to build up the military, and the government's proposals are almost immediately approved by Congress. It is known that both the Senate and the House of Representatives have obtained extremely important information about the international crisis and the changes in Europe and Asia, and they believe that the overall situation is indeed urgent. The emotions and thoughts of the American people on the issue of war have also changed greatly. This is extremely important. Whether Wilkie or Roosevelt is elected president, there will be no major changes in the state and determination of America's war preparations. This can be asserted.</p>
<p>Anglo-American Unity</p>
<p>Stronger Than Before</p>
<p>In recent years, the United States has been making economic adjustments. If other countries continue to take provocative steps, causing the United States to fight simultaneously in both oceans, its economic structure will be able to stand firm. What's more, the strength of the British Navy is still intact. The unity between Britain and the United States is now stronger than it was during the last World War. During the last World War, the United States did not participate until two years later. Now, it has only been a little over a year, and the American government and people are well aware of the problems involved and their significance to the United States. As for the conscription of millions of young people into the army and navy, and the government's right to requisition property and wealth when necessary, these are merely signs of America's psychological preparation for war.</p>
<p>International Situation</p>
<p>Everyone Understands</p>
<p>The vast majority of Americans have a unified opinion on international issues. Compared with internal political disputes, they are insignificant. Isolationism has long been eliminated. Every household is eagerly listening to international news reports on the radio every day. American newspapers and magazines are spending huge sums of money to send the most capable reporters to station in various parts of the world to gather detailed news and report to the public. Those who want to understand the strength of American public opinion and the strength of mobilization must not neglect this reality.</p>
<p>Gentle Words</p>
<p>Decisive Actions</p>
<p>The proactive position in the current international dispute has recently shifted from Germany and Italy to the United States. Although the United States still wants to avoid open warfare with any country in Asia or Europe, it has acknowledged that the time for resorting to treaties and international concessions has passed. The "speak softly and carry a big stick" policy advocated by President Wilson and the 26th President Theodore Roosevelt during the last World War has reappeared today. It took Germany a long time to rise and implement conscription. However, the United States has now risen and is rapidly implementing conscription.</p>
<p>Prepared to Deal with</p>
<p>Any Eventuality</p>
<p>Bishop Ward said that in the months before leaving the United States, he had twice crossed the American continent and traveled to the most remote states in the United States to personally ask people from all walks of life about their views and attitudes. He learned that the American people are all concerned about the issue of world war. If the belligerent countries can restore reason and conduct fair negotiations on international issues, the United States is still willing to work with other countries to seek peace. However, the United States is now determined to use its maximum strength to deal with any eventuality. This is clearly visible.</p>
<h3>People Have Starved to Death in the Japanese Blockade Zone in Western Shanghai: The Japanese Are Searching the Entire Area: The Survival of Residents is Uncertain: Relief from the Tragedy Depends on Assistance</h3>
<p>According to the English-language Great American Evening Post, the lanes and alleys of Jikefeili Road, Tongyu Road, and Chenlu are still blockaded by the Japanese military police, "municipal police," and "special agents." As a result of not being able to go out to shop, two people have starved to death inside. One was an old man in his sixties, and the other was a fourteen-year-old youth suffering from illness.</p>
<p>Expanded Search</p>
<p>After Seiichi Sato, the head of the Shanghai Japanese Military Police team, was assassinated at 668 Yuyuan Road on the 18th of this month (yesterday's newspaper mistakenly printed it as Lane 668), the Japanese side immediately implemented strict security measures in the area of western Shanghai. Japanese military police were stationed along the way to strictly search pedestrians. The security and search area was initially limited to Yuyuan Road, Jikefeili Road, Yidingpan Road, Daxilu Road, Difeng Road, and other areas, but this morning it has been expanded to Bailinan Road and Zhaofeng Park, covering the entire area of western Shanghai. Two days after Sato was assassinated, the Japanese military police set up a long table at the intersection of Yuyuan Road and Difeng Road. Anyone passing through that place must register their name, origin, age, address, and occupation. In the previous few days, women passing through that place did not need this procedure, but from this morning onwards, women cannot be exempted either. The severity of the situation is unprecedented. It is also heard that as a result of the searches conducted by the Japanese army on the roads of western Shanghai in recent days, about 200 civilians have been arrested as suspicious.</p>
<p>Difficult Transportation</p>
<p>Currently, bus routes 1, 14, and 2, and trolleybus route 20 still only travel to the area and terminate at Jing'an Temple Road. Another shuttle bus is dispatched to run between Jing'an Temple Road and Zhaofeng Park, Dunxin Road, and Anhe Temple Road. Residents in the western Shanghai area are currently living in seclusion, so there are very few passengers on the buses. Yesterday morning, a reporter from a Western newspaper went to inspect the area and saw buses traveling from Jing'an Temple to Jikefeili Road and Pingyuan Road forced to stop. Chinese passengers had to get off and leave their names and were only allowed to move forward after being searched. Pedestrians and passengers in cars must also be searched, but foreigners are not interfered with. As for the incident site of the Japanese military police assassination, 668 Lane, Qianjia Alley, which connects Jikefeili Road to the north, Malu Bridge, Kaina Road 189 Lane to the south, and Yuyuan Road 608 Lane, Tianzhuang, to the east, and Jikefeili Road to the northeast, Yanjiatai, the Japanese side immediately erected barbed wire fences at all exits after the incident and blockaded them. On the morning of the 21st, the Japanese side once ordered the residents in the blocked area to provide mutual guarantees to allow entry and exit, but this measure was short-lived and was cancelled.</p>
<p>Residents Starving</p>
<p>There are about 20 factories, more than 100 shops, about 3,000 employees, and 20,000 residents in the area. There was originally one rice shop in Qianjia Alley, with no more than dozens of shi of rice, which has all been sold out in the past week. It is heard that the price of rice in the area has now increased to 160 yuan per dan, but no one has been able to buy it. Poor residents have been starving for several days. Because the area is tightly sealed, garbage trucks and garbage trucks cannot enter the area to work, resulting in messy garbage and garbage in the area. It is also learned that a catty of green vegetables in the area costs as much as 1.2 yuan, and a large pancake costs half a yuan. It is hoped that international people with humanitarian hearts will find a way to send food to help these thousands of innocent poor people.</p>
<h3>The French Concession Removed the Blockade Network the Night Before Last: Most of the Important Roads Have Been Announced: The Police Still Have the Power to Block at Any Time</h3>
<p>In order to maintain law and order within the concession, the French Concession authorities took strict special security measures, sealing off most of the roads within the concession with barbed wire fences. The few openings that were left were also heavily guarded by detectives. For more than two months, it has not been relaxed at all. Although the residents in the concession felt extremely inconvenienced and the various shops were also considerably affected, because of the strict security measures, the</p>
<p>Crime Decreased</p>
<p>Security was able to be ensured. Now the French Concession authorities, because the situation in the concession is peaceful and the traffic strike has also been resolved, in order to reduce the inconvenience of traffic for residents, they especially removed most of the road blockades that had been maintained for more than a month, starting at 8:00 PM the night before last. It is calculated that the barbed wire fences that have been removed include the Bund, Jiangxi Road, Old North Gate, Great World, Mahuo Road, Chongqing Road, Fuxu Road, Notre Dame Road, Albert Road, etc. Places where openings have been opened include Jixiang Street, Zhengjia Mu, Natural Fire Street, Jule Road, Marang Road, and Beidi'aos Road. Residents in general all find it convenient. At the same time, the armored vehicles that used to be stationed at various important locations have</p>
<p>Disappeared Without a Trace</p>
<p>However, this move does not mean the removal of special security measures. Military police are still stationed at various fortresses and important intersections. The main traffic routes have increased police force guarding them with automatic rifles. Patrols are still active. It is learned that if the order of the French Concession is peaceful, it is possible to maintain the status quo for a longer period of time. Otherwise, it will still use its power to adopt strict measures at any time.</p>
<h3>New American Consul General: Took Office Yesterday</h3>
<p>Lockhart, the new American Consul General in Shanghai, arrived in Shanghai on the President Coolidge steamer the day before yesterday and checked into the Huamao Hotel on the Bund that evening. At 9:00 AM yesterday, Mr. Locke went to the American Consulate on Jiangxi Road to take office. The transfer was handled by Deputy Consul General Potterick. From yesterday onwards, the affairs of the American Consulate will be executed by Mr. Locke. The main task of the consulate is to continue to handle the withdrawal of non-essential American expatriates staying in Shanghai. After taking office, Mr. Locke immediately met with military and political officials stationed in Shanghai, such as Rear Admiral Glassford, Commander of the Yangtze River Fleet, and Major Baker, Commander of the American Defense Forces in Shanghai. In the afternoon, Mr. Locke left the consulate to pay a return visit to the officers.</p>
<h3>Abe Returns to Japan</h3>
<p>General Abe, the Japanese "special envoy," left Shanghai on the Japanese postal ship Tatsuta Maru at 11:00 AM yesterday to return to Japan. The Japanese newspapers have forbidden the publication of Abe's decision to come to Shanghai, for reasons unknown. Abe arrived in Shanghai by train from Ningbo at 3:30 PM the day before yesterday. The traffic along North Sichuan Road and along the range road was cut off for 15 minutes when Abe arrived in Shanghai. After getting off the train, Abe, dressed in plain clothes and accompanied by escorts, rode in a car with the flag of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and went to the Japanese Consulate with the Director of the Chinese Intelligence Department of the Japanese Army, who came to welcome him.</p>
<h3>The Deadline for the Tenth Month Settlement is Approaching - Internal Market Meeting</h3>
<p>As the deadline for the tenth month settlement in the Shanghai commercial market approaches, the Bankers' Association will hold an internal market meeting at 2 PM today. The meeting will address extending credit for existing clients with loans due in the tenth month and appropriately providing new loans. This will be limited to factories and businesses dealing in domestic goods. Various industries that have borrowed have already contacted banks and firms to negotiate extension and repayment procedures. While there is no precise total for loans due in the tenth month, it is estimated to be between 50 and 60 million yuan, a significant decrease compared to before the war. This is because, after the war, banks and firms primarily focused on secured loans, considering unsecured loans too risky and tightening them. This has led to an abundance of idle funds in the Shanghai financial market, resulting in the continued prevalence of speculative businesses. While bank deposits have increased, there is a lack of proper investment channels. The movement of funds to the interior is underway, so credit is loose, and the market remains relatively stable. Various industries should be able to weather this tenth-month settlement. However, industries are facing reduced exports due to obstructed transportation to the interior. Efforts are currently being made to establish joint transportation of passengers and goods between Shanghai, Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou provinces to facilitate cargo transport and alleviate the difficulties faced by Jiangsu merchants.</p>
<h3>Four Steamers Detained for Over a Year - Rumored to be Released</h3>
<p>The steamships "Li Bao," "Chao Yang," "Mao Da," and "Mao Quan," which formerly operated on the Zhejiang shipping route, were detained by the Japanese last spring on the grounds of unclear nationality. They have been held for nearly a year. In mid-September of this year, rumors circulated that the Japanese would release them. However, the ships remain moored at Buoy No. 11 in Yangshupu. A Datong News Agency reporter inquired with relevant parties and learned that the Japanese initially planned to purchase the vessels but the owners refused. It is now rumored that release procedures are being considered and that the ships will be returned.</p>
<h3>Increased Cigarette Tax</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance has telegraphed the consolidated tax authorities in Fujian, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and the southwestern regions, stating that due to recent soaring prices, the tax-paid prices and tax rates for consolidated taxes on tobacco and alcohol should be revised accordingly. The Ministry has approved the following regarding consolidated taxes: (1) Machine-made cigarettes will be taxed in four grades. Those with a registered price of 1600 yuan or more per 50,000-cigarette carton will be in the first grade and taxed 1600 yuan. Those with a registered price between 800 and 1600 yuan will be in the second grade and taxed 800 yuan. Those with a registered price between 400 and 800 yuan will be in the third grade and taxed 400 yuan. Those with a registered price below 400 yuan will be in the fourth grade and taxed 200 yuan. (2) Hand-rolled cigarettes will be taxed in two grades. Those with a registered price between 100 and 200 yuan per 50,000 cigarettes will be in the first grade and taxed 200 yuan. Those with a registered price below 100 yuan will be in the second grade and taxed 50 yuan.</p>
<h3>Telephone Service Disrupted in Zhabei - Japanese Side Attaches Great Importance</h3>
<p>At approximately 11:30 PM the day before yesterday, the cable of the "China Electric Communication Company" in Hongkou, specifically the one inside the Commercial Press on Baoshan Road, was inexplicably cut. As a result, telephone service in the Zhabei area was disrupted. The company has dispatched a repair crew to urgently repair the cut. An investigation suggests that this was purely an act of theft, but it is also being treated with great importance.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Invade Gan Village - Retreat After Fierce Battle</h3>
<p>According to reliable sources in the shipping industry, on the morning of the 17th, Japanese troops invaded Gan Village. Forty to fifty Japanese soldiers launched a fierce attack. Chinese troops mounted a resolute defense, and a fierce battle ensued. By approximately 3 PM, the Japanese were routed. The island is now pacified, and shipping to and from Shanghai is proceeding as usual.</p>
<h3>Rice Market Flooded with Spot Goods - Rice Prices Decline Again Yesterday</h3>
<p>The stockpile of rice in Shanghai is gradually increasing, causing panic among hoarders. To avoid unexpected losses, they are supplying the market with large quantities of spot goods. The rice market is crowded with people, and brokers are extremely busy. These individuals are acting as agents for firms, facilitating transactions and earning commissions. Sales are also frequently observed. However, buyers are hesitant and taking a wait-and-see approach, anticipating further price declines. Yesterday morning, after the rice market opened, conditions were extremely quiet. Rice prices fell by approximately 10 to 20 cents per shi, following the decline of the previous day. Spot goods are abundant.</p>
<h3>British Concession Has No Aggressive Measures for Evacuation - British American Tobacco Company Has Notified Employees to Bear Travel Expenses for Family Evacuation</h3>
<p>Regarding the evacuation of non-essential British nationals from Shanghai, inquiries made by reporters yesterday with British Concession authorities revealed that the British government has not made any further plans. British nationals have also not made any preparations for voluntary evacuation. However, it is understood that the British American Tobacco Company in Shanghai has notified all employees with British or American nationality that the company will bear all travel expenses for employees who evacuate their wives and children from Shanghai. It is reported that only a portion of employees will take advantage of this preferential treatment. However, it is generally expected that if the situation deteriorates further, more employees will be willing to accept it. According to British shipping companies, the British Embassy's announcement has not caused a rush to purchase ship tickets. While current travel to Europe is severely restricted, it is reported that there are many people booking tickets for ships sailing to Australia. There has been no news regarding the British government's plans to increase the number of ships for evacuating nationals in the event of an emergency.</p>
<p>Washington Instructions</p>
<p>Reduced Fares</p>
<p>The American President Lines received instructions yesterday from Washington regarding the four major passenger ships scheduled to evacuate American nationals from the Far East. Fares will be reduced. The President Monroe, arriving in Shanghai on November 1st, will maintain its usual first-class fares, but berths in common rooms will be reduced by US$50 per person. The new second-class fares will range from US$240 to US$350, and first-class fares will start at US$395, similar to the President Coolidge. Fares for the Matson liner Mariposa will be approximately the same. However, details about fare changes for the Washington and Manhattan were not available yesterday. It is understood that even with full occupancy, the related companies will suffer losses under the new fares. The US government has guaranteed to compensate the shipping companies for any losses incurred. The President Monroe has increased the number of second-class berths to 230 and first-class berths to over 630. Meanwhile, the meetings held by various American groups in Shanghai have not yielded concrete results.</p>
<h3>British Scholar Arrives in Shanghai from London - Discusses Impressions of the European War After a Year (Part 1) - Mentions the Impact on the Far East</h3>
<p>More than a year has passed since the expansion of the European War. After the setbacks in the French campaign, all parties are placing their hopes on the British side of the war. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency interviewed a prominent British scholar yesterday, who had just arrived in Shanghai from London, to discuss the recent situation of the European War. Having personally experienced major war zones in Europe, his observations are detailed. He also has important insights into the impact of the European War on the Far East. The various situations are recorded below:</p>
<p>French Setbacks</p>
<p>The collapse of France left Britain in a position of fighting alone. The well-equipped and trained British Expeditionary Force escaped from a difficult situation, sustaining considerable losses in armaments and materiel. As of today, the other side of the English Channel is in German hands. However, less than half an hour away from England by air, there are strong British air force bases, including the largest naval ports. What the world expected was a swift surrender, or at best a swift compromise, so that Germany could annex the newly defeated countries and turn against the British Empire. Britain is now the bravest nation and the only nation with superior armaments compared to Germany.</p>
<p>British Air Force</p>
<p>The causes and consequences of this European War are now clear. The inadequate use of the League of Nations over the past twenty years has led to this dispute. Originally, building a continental army would not have been a problem. France could have been in a leading position in military affairs, with the British support forming ten divisions, all mechanized units with the latest weapons. In fact, Britain supplied more than twelve divisions, in addition to numerous local reserve troops and a large number of soldiers who, sensing the urgency of the situation before the outbreak of war, had registered but had not been trained. The Navy was also sufficient to control the seas, ready to respond to any German naval activity. As for the British Air Force, although small in number, it was exquisitely trained, so the only thing that Germany believed it could not suppress was the British Air Force.</p>
<p>Strategic Gains and Losses</p>
<p>Aggressor nations often have an advantage in attack; they can choose the time and place to make the most effective surprise attack. The defending nation, on the other hand, does not know when the other side will attack, so it can only be vigilant at all times. As a result, because the defense has lasted too long, it is broken through.</p>
<p>The Retreat</p>
<p>In the air force aspect, British planning was clearly superior, because whether in equipment or personnel, it far surpassed Germany. Once, the British army was trapped in Dunkirk, and everyone thought it would be completely wiped out. However, although the military situation had reached an irredeemable point, thanks to the devoted efforts of all the officers and soldiers of the army, navy, and air force, the miracle of a safe withdrawal was achieved. This was the first failure of the German Air Force. Out of 25,000 targets, only 50 ships were sunk, which shows that the threat of the air force is no more fearsome than that of submarines. As for sealing off ships in the English Channel, it is impossible. The German gun emplacements defending the narrow passage between Calais and Dover could not prevent escort ships from coming and going, but instead allowed them to safely reach London.</p>
<p>Air Raid Situation</p>
<p>German aircraft first use a few or a small squadron of aircraft to conduct reconnaissance over London, followed by bombing of airfields to drive away fighter planes, making it easier for bombers to attack. However, after two months of continuous bombing, not a single airfield has been destroyed. Instead, reports are often received that many squadrons of German aircraft turn back before reaching the British coast. The British side has many prominent targets, such as docks and aircraft manufacturing plants, which the Germans believe are too costly to attack. Because each air raid causes only minor damage to materiel or personnel, the Germans vent their anger by dropping their bombs on unprotected workers' villages in the cities. The Germans have completely forgotten the lessons learned during the last Great War. They are judging others by themselves, preparing to strike at British morale. Even in the Napoleonic Wars, the poet Schiller advised the Germans to organize guerrilla forces to resist for a long time. But their plan was not accepted, because the Germans knew that if they had to risk losing their property during the war, they would not want to fight. It costs the German aircraft a great price to attack England from the sky, as evidenced by the air raids on August 18, September 15, and September 27. As for night raids, even with a clear moon, the military losses are minimal. The number of German bombers is often four or five times that of British fighter planes. However, the British Air Force has not suffered any defeats. During several air raids, it is cheaper for the defender than for the attacker, because air combat is carried out over British soil or the English Channel, so most of the British pilots shot down by German aircraft can often be rescued, while German pilots, once shot down, are a loss, whether dead or alive. The seriousness of the situation is evidenced by Germany's request that Red Cross ships be allowed to cross the English Channel. Such appeals are originally not made unless they have to be.</p>

<h3>Transportation Labor Dispute Between Two Companies - No Mutual Compensation for Losses - Intercommunication of Vehicles Has Not Yet Resumed Yesterday</h3>
<p>After the French-owned Water and Electricity Company workers returned to work the day before yesterday, all vehicles have resumed their old routes. However, of the thirty-nine Route 22 buses running from Xujiahui to the Bund, only thirty-four were dispatched yesterday because more than ten workers had not returned to work. The remaining five vehicles can also be dispatched after all the workers arrive today.</p>
<p>Strike Losses</p>
<p>No Mutual Compensation</p>
<p>The British-owned Shanghai Electric Construction Company and the French-owned Electric Company have an agreement regarding the operation of each other's vehicles outside their respective areas. The British company's Route 5 trams and Route 17 and 24 trolleybuses can operate in the French Concession. The French company's Route 5 trams and Route 17, 18 and 24 trolleybuses can also operate in the International Settlement. The fare revenue is collected by the company in each area. Both parties have agreed that if there are strikes or other situations that prevent the trams from operating on their usual routes, the losses will be compensated by the company where the incident occurred. However, since this strike occurred simultaneously in both concessions, neither party will compensate for losses.</p>
<p>Connecting Transportation</p>
<p>Awaiting Resumption</p>
<p>However, transportation links between the two concessions have not yet resumed as of yesterday. One account is that the two companies have not yet agreed on the issue of vehicle transfers, and another is that the British company's go-slow strike has not been fully resolved. Therefore, the two concessions cannot communicate for the time being. However, residents who want to take a vehicle from the International Settlement to the French Concession, or from the French Concession to the International Settlement, still need to transfer vehicles, so they feel very inconvenient. They all hope that the tram company authorities in the two concessions can agree on a transportation plan as soon as possible to facilitate transportation.</p>
<h3>Mill Notes in Circulation</h3>
<p>Those not yet issued are deposited.</p>
<p>Those in circulation are not redeemed.</p>
<p>The Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank of China, have received an order from the Ministry of Finance stating that, mill notes in Guangdong Province were, in 1936, reissued after the Ministry issued a government bond to replenish the reserve for financial stability in Guangdong and in 1937, it was clearly stipulated that one yuan of mill notes should be equivalent to four jiao and four fen of legal tender. All receipts and payments of public and private funds in Guangdong Province were required to be made at this rate. Since its implementation, the credit of mill notes has become increasingly consolidated. In order to consider the current situation of the Guangdong goods market and to prevent any attempts to disrupt financial stability, the following measures are specifically formulated: (1) One yuan of mill notes in Guangdong is equivalent to seven jiao of legal tender and there is no need for redemption. (2) All public and private funds and all buying and selling transactions in Guangdong Province must be conducted at the above rate. Violators will be punished. Those who privately set market prices by silver shops will be severely punished for the crime of disrupting financial stability once they are found. (3) Mill notes in Guangdong that have not been issued must be delivered to the Guangzhou branch of the Issuance Reserve Management Committee immediately for safekeeping and cannot be reissued without the approval of the Ministry of Finance. (4) The Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank of China, and the Guangdong Provincial Bank, can only issue drafts for the interior of Guangdong Province when they receive mill notes in Hong Kong and will not redeem legal tender in Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Rewards Police Officers for Bravery</h3>
<p>At approximately 8:15 PM on the night of the first of last month, four robbers, two of whom were armed with handguns, broke into a rice store at No. 261 Zhoushan Road to rob it. As they were searching, one of the store's employees secretly slipped out the back door and called the Huishan Police Station through a neighbor. After receiving the report, the police station immediately dispatched several detectives, including Western Deputy Inspector Blythe Sandin, Western Detective Brandenburg, and Maytley, to rush to the scene. Deputy Inspector Blythe saw through the gap in the shop door that the robbers were still coercing the store employees and had not left. He immediately instructed his two companions to go around to the side door and guarded the front door with a Japanese probationary police officer. After a while, he knocked on the door. When the door opened, he saw a robber pointing a gun at him. The deputy inspector immediately fired several shots, wounding two robbers. One of the robbers soon died.</p>
<p>Also, at approximately 1:20 PM on August 24, two cases of armed robbery occurred at a residence at No. 433 Lane on Xinza Road. After hearing the alarm, the police station immediately dispatched Western Sergeant Holden, probationary Sergeants Hickbert, Marguez, and Erickson, Chinese Detective No. 292, and Chinese Constable No. 1536 and others to rush to the scene. Probationary Sergeant Hickbert broke down the door and saw two robbers trying to escape upstairs. Hickbert immediately fired a shot and, together with two other companions, went upstairs to pursue them. They then discovered an armed robber on the roof of the house at No. 10 and captured him, seizing his handgun. The other robber jumped from the roof, was injured, and fell to the ground. Probationary Sergeant Ellis captured him and seized his handgun.</p>
<p>Also, at 5:15 AM on July 18, robbers, including two armed individuals, broke into a boiled water shop at No. 3 Xinzhaobridge Road, intending to rob it. The shop owner shouted for help. The robbers failed to rob and fled through the door. At this time, Chinese Constable No. 492 and others heard the alarm and rushed to the scene. They saw three robbers fleeing along the Meibaiker Road and Shanhai Pass Road area, so they immediately chased after them. Chinese Constable No. 3332 and 3264 joined the chase. A robber was shot and wounded by Chinese Constable No. 3332 on Chengdu Road, and his handgun was seized.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department Awards Committee has approved the issuance of a medal to Western Deputy Inspector Blythe Sandin, who is resourceful and brave and deserves commendation (Blythe has previously been awarded a second-class medal). In addition, a second-class medal will be awarded to each of the Western Probationary Sergeant Hickbert and Chinese Constable No. 3332 to show encouragement.</p>
<h3>Direct Shanghai-Burma Shipping - Cargo Congestion</h3>
<p>The Grayle Steamer will Sail to Rangoon the Day After Tomorrow</p>
<p>The Shenguang Steamer will Sail to Singapore</p>
<p>After the reopening of the Burma Road, foreign shipping companies in Shanghai are urgently seeking direct shipping routes between Shanghai and Burma. The Taikoo Company has already shipped several batches of cargo to Rangoon, transported via Hong Kong and Singapore. Today, another batch is being loaded onto the Jinan steamer for transport to Hong Kong and then to Rangoon. The Grayle steamer of Zilai Foreign Company, manager of the Tongyi and Hongyun shipping companies, which was originally scheduled to depart today, will now clear customs tomorrow due to cargo congestion and incomplete procedures, and will set sail directly for Rangoon the day after tomorrow (the 27th), with stopovers at Moulmein and Calcutta. The Shenguang steamer of Yilong Company, also managed by the two shipping companies, was originally planned to sail to Rangoon with the Grayle, but has now been changed to sail to Hong Kong and Singapore due to pending cargo. It is scheduled to depart tomorrow. In addition, the Santai steamer, jointly operated by China Through Transportation Navigation Company and the Tongyi Shipping Company, which will sail directly to Hong Kong, is scheduled to depart tomorrow. It is heard that the post office has set up an office in Rangoon and a joint postal station in Lashio.</p>

<h3>Wang Peng Narrowly Escapes an Assassination Attempt at the Intersection of Jiangxi Road and Nanjing Road - Thugs Ambush but He Escapes - Bodyguard Resists and Dies from Gunshot Wounds</h3>
<p>A shooting incident occurred at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Jiangxi Road at approximately 12:15 PM yesterday, with gunfire erupting suddenly, creating a tense situation. The target fortunately escaped, but one bodyguard died. A passerby was wounded by a stray bullet. The details of the incident are reported below:</p>
<p>Sudden Ambush</p>
<p>Wang Peng, from Anhui Province, is 38 years old and currently resides at No. 38, Lane 192, Boundary Road. He formerly served as an adjutant in Yang Huqian's Shanghai Garrison Headquarters. He is currently employed as a comprador for the British-owned China General Omnibus Company and jointly owns the Wankang Gold Shop at No. 310 Jiangxi Road, serving as its manager. He owns a private car and employs a bodyguard, Chen Lihong, from Nanjing (33 years old this year), who protects him at all times. At 12:10 PM yesterday, he left the writing room in his gold shop, intending to return home for lunch. As he was walking to his car in front of the Jiutai Exchange Shop on the south side of Nanjing Road, he suddenly encountered danger.</p>
<p>Battle Between Both Sides</p>
<p>Just as he was getting into the car, two thugs in blue cotton long gowns suddenly drew out Mauser pistols and ambushed Wang. Fortunately, they missed. His bodyguard, Chen Lihong, seeing the situation, immediately drew his gun and returned fire. The thugs then shifted their target and engaged with Chen. More than twenty shots were fired, the sound of bullets was like a string of firecrackers. At that time, Wang also drew his gun and opened fire on the thugs, but they were not injured. As a result, Chen was shot in the right side of the abdomen, collapsed, and fell onto the sidewalk of the Jiutai Exchange Shop, gasping for breath and bleeding profusely. Seeing that their objective had been achieved, the assassins fled north with their weapons and disappeared without a trace.</p>
<p>Passersby Wounded</p>
<p>During the battle between the two sides, pedestrians scattered and fled, creating a very chaotic situation. At the same time, the Central Police Station heard the alarm and quickly dispatched a large number of police officers in patrol cars to rush to the scene, blockading the streets and searching door to door, but ultimately found nothing. During the shooting, a stray bullet hit the arm of a rickshaw passenger, who was later taken to the hospital for treatment. A Russian man sitting by the window of the Victoria Cafe across the street witnessed the assassins running north and quickly grabbed an ashtray and threw it at the thugs from the window. Unfortunately, it fell just a few feet short and missed.</p>
<p>Bodyguard Died</p>
<p>After the event, it was learned that the injured Chen Lihong was 29 years old, from Nanjing, and had been employed in his position for over two years. He was usually honest and hardworking, and was deeply trusted by his employer Wang. Yesterday, he was wearing a navy blue woolen student uniform and brown leather shoes. The serial number of his bodyguard's self-defense pistol was 931733. Chen resided in Hongkou. Soon after, the Red Cross ambulance arrived at the scene and rushed him to Tongren Hospital for treatment. However, he had already died mid-journey due to the severity of his injuries. The body was then transported to the morgue of Tongren Hospital. At approximately 6:00 PM, the body was transferred to the coroner's office.</p>
<h3>Head Nurse's Death: Lawsuit Over Funeral Expenses - Testimony Heard Yesterday</h3>
<p>Following the sudden death on the night of June 10th of Li Yuying (also known as Jie Ru), a woman from Fujian who was the head nurse at the Ya'er Sanatorium on Route Paul Henry (Pu Shi Lu), the hospital's business manager, Lu Zhenqing, failed to report the death to the police for an autopsy as required. Instead, he instructed Dr. Lin Zhengliang to issue a death certificate stating the cause as a stroke. This led to accusations and a lawsuit against Lu and Lin for forging documents, filed by the prosecutor at the High Court Third Branch. A hearing was scheduled for November 5th. However, Li's death has caused</p>
<p>Multiple Disputes,</p>
<p>attracting Social Attention. Tao Yangwu, the manager of the Chinese Funeral Home, is now suing Li Yuying's father, Li Shizhen, in the Civil Division of the Second Special Court, seeking unpaid funeral expenses of 2,404.24 yuan. Judge Tan Hao has held two hearings. The defendant is represented by lawyers Wu Zhibing, Wang Hengyi, and Li Zhongdao. Due to Lu Zhenqing's absence, the hearing was adjourned. These details have been previously reported. Yesterday afternoon,</p>
<p>The Hearing Resumed.</p>
<p>According to Lu Zhenqing's testimony, he only signed the funeral home's authorization form, assuming responsibility for handling the arrangements. The principal mourner was Li Shizhen, so Li should bear the expenses. Witnesses Gan Bowen and He Shuyu (both women, former colleagues of the deceased who have left the Sino-Western Sanatorium), Yan Xianhong, Chen Muxi, and Wu Wenjun all testified that after Li Yuying's death, Lu Zhenqing, without waiting for the deceased's parents to arrive,</p>
<p>Took Charge,</p>
<p>notifying the funeral home to take the body away. On the day of the encoffining, guests suggested that the clothing and coffin should not be too extravagant, but Lu stated that the deceased had made contributions to the hospital, so the hospital would bear the expenses as a donation. Many guests present were aware of this. Gan, He, and Yan further clarified that the funeral expenses had already been collected from Lu Zhenqing by representatives of the Chinese Funeral Home. The court questioned Lu Zhenqing about this. He replied that he never said that, and that the witnesses present today all had</p>
<p>Conflicting Interests</p>
<p>with the Li family and were giving False Testimony. Gan and He swore an oath in court to demonstrate the honesty of their testimony against Lu. After both sides' lawyers presented their opinions, the court considered the defendant's legal arguments to be valid and adjourned the hearing to November 14th.</p>
<h3>Two Notorious Robbers, Repeatedly Involved in Major Cases, Scheduled for Sentencing</h3>
<p>Detectives from the Old Gate Police Station, both Chinese and foreign, previously apprehended two notorious robbers: Cao Yong from Xuzhou (father's name Lao Si) and Zhang Fa from Yangzhou. Investigations revealed that the two criminals were involved in the robbery of the Defu Bank on Jiujiang Road on September 11th, where stocks and bonds worth over 257,000 yuan were stolen, as well as the July 26th robbery of the Chinese police officer's handguns at 1553 and 1593 Gordon Road, and numerous other cases within the district. They were prosecuted by the First Special Court. These details have been previously reported. Now, further investigation has revealed that the two criminals were also involved in two major cases: (1) the Kidnapping of senior employees of the Nanyang Tobacco Company, Feng Jiaxiang and Li Zitang, for ransom at 433 Yu Garden Road on May 2nd at 2:05 PM; and (2) the Robbery of Chinese police officer Xia Shutang's handgun and legal tender at 138 Hart Road, Kangnaowan, on January 23rd at 1:10 PM. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Xie Fen held a further hearing on this case. The police lawyer, Ru Bao Yi, charged the two defendants with committing additional crimes, which they both readily admitted. The court then appointed lawyer Zhu Hui as the defendants' legal representative and announced the end of the debate, setting a date for sentencing.</p>
<h3>Four Robberies Yesterday</h3>
<p>Near Peng Road and Zha Pu Road, at approximately 4:30 PM yesterday, a man was walking when he was suddenly robbed by three robbers. One of them displayed a handgun and stole 1,000 yuan in national currency.</p>
<p>Near the St. John's University on Route Extrême Orient, at approximately 4:45 PM yesterday, four robbers robbed a passerby. After shouting for help, street police rushed to the scene and fired a shot, resulting in the arrest of one robber.</p>
<p>Near Hart Road and Route Ferguson, at approximately 5:15 PM yesterday, a Western woman was walking when she was suddenly stopped by four unarmed robbers who blocked her path. They stole a purse containing national currency and a watch, with a total value of 120 yuan.</p>
<p>At 76, Lane 1081, Jing An Temple Road, at 5:30 PM yesterday, four robbers arrived, two of them displaying firearms. They stole jewelry worth 200 yuan.</p>
<h3>Headless Corpse Discovered at Xiaoshadu Road and Nanyang Road; Head Later Found on Xinzha Road; Case Unclear, Police Investigating Vigorously</h3>
<p>At 6:01 AM yesterday, a sanitation worker, number 27, from the Public Works Department was working at Xiaoshadu Road and Nanyang Road when he discovered a straw mat by the roadside. Upon opening it, he was horrified to find a headless male corpse. The body was wearing a dark brown short shirt and trousers and was barefoot. He immediately reported to the Jing An Temple Police Station, who dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives to investigate. Shortly thereafter, near the roadside at the intersection of New Zha Road and Seymour Road, a cardboard box that appeared to have once contained a radio was found. Inside was a human head, with a flat-top haircut, appearing to be in its thirties, and seeming to have been cut from the headless corpse. The detectives removed the head and body to the morgue and launched a detailed investigation to report back to the police for further action.</p>
<p>Eyewitness Account</p>
<p>According to eyewitnesses, the severed head was thrown from a speeding car that quickly turned west, but the license plate number could not be clearly seen at the time. After the incident, the police dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives to conduct a thorough investigation. In addition to photographing the body and head and sending them to the morgue, they are also investigating the deceased's name, age, and origin in order to clarify the case and apprehend the fleeing murderer. The clothing worn by the male corpse indicated that he was not from the upper class.</p>
<p>One of the Thugs</p>
<p>According to a report by a Dazhong News Agency reporter, the victim was one of the thugs from the Western Shanghai badlands, killed by his own gang due to a betrayal. After killing him, the gang drove in a car to the corner of Xiaoshadu Road, where they threw away his head, and then to Nanyang Road, where they abandoned his body on the road. When the body was discovered by the Chinese police, it was still warm, so it is believed that the murder had occurred not long before. However, the name of the victim had not yet been confirmed as of last night.</p>
<h3>French Tram Workers' Compensation for Zhang Rongkang</h3>
<p>Zhang Rongkang, a young man from Taicang, 18 years old, worked as a ticket seller, number 527, for the Eighth Division of the French Tram Company. When all of the mechanics, drivers, and ticket sellers of the French Tram Company went on strike on the 25th of last month, the company hired other workers to drive the vehicles to maintain public transportation. Zhang Rongkang, along with other striking workers, obstructed the vehicles at the intersection of Route Lufan and Rue Pére Hilarion, resulting in him being shot in the abdomen. He was taken to Guangci Hospital by the police, but died on the 29th of the same month. The death was reported, and the Second Special Court sent officials to verify it. The body was taken to the Shanghai Funeral Home for encoffining. Now that the strike has been resolved successfully, all workers returned to work the day before yesterday, and all routes resumed normal operations yesterday. It is reported that regarding the compensation issue for the deceased ticket seller Zhang Rongkang, in addition to the 500 yuan given by the company, more than 2,000 colleagues will each contribute two yuan, totaling 5,000 yuan, which will be given to his family by the fellow workers.</p>

<h3>A Real Man Should Be Energetic and Strong... Why Be Weak and Incompetent...</h3>
<p>As husbands with wives, our responsibilities are immensely significant. Not only do we bear the responsibilities of the entire family on our shoulders, but the rise and fall of the nation rests on the shoulders of every citizen. We must also bear some responsibility for society and the nation. Therefore, it is said that a real man should be energetic and strong, striving to be successful, so that he can fulfill his duties with joy. Indeed, a strong man with abundant energy will surely have a fulfilling married life with deep love for each other. The children they bear are the unique crystallization of their love, and the family they build is a happy nest they share. Therefore, his only comfort lies in his wife and children. What hardship can there be in having a family? In serving society professionally, he can also be diligent and dedicated, increasing his work efficiency and reaping rich rewards. Such a husband, although he cannot be said to have achieved self-cultivation, family harmony, national governance, and world peace, can be said to have fulfilled his responsibilities and can be considered a happy and fortunate person. However, if a man suffers from depleted essence and blood due to early self-indulgence and nocturnal emissions, or post-marital debauchery, overindulgence, and worries, resulting in kidney deficiency, impotence, scattered energy, incomplete development, loss of function, as well as neurological weakness symptoms such as brain swelling, headaches, forgetfulness, insomnia, lower back pain, and physical fatigue, he will lose interest even in a beautiful wife. But the way of husband and wife cannot be separated from the relationship between spirit and flesh. When the wife feels lonely, filled with passion, and the husband cannot give her comfort, how can she not be disappointed and resentful? In this situation, an unpleasant cloud will inevitably arise between husband and wife. If this cloud is not quickly dispelled, it will gradually darken and engulf all the light and happiness of his future! Moreover, due to physical weakness, how can he be resourceful, hardworking, and move forward on the path to success in his career? He will inevitably fall into unemployment, poverty, and heavy family burdens! The state of life in such a situation is indescribably difficult!</p>
<p>However, the above-mentioned diseases are not incurable. In today's world of advanced medicine, there are even effective treatments. Why not love yourself and suffer for a long time? An effective treatment is to take the gonadotropic hormone preparation "Sperm Vitality." This agent is made from gonadotropic hormones extracted from strong animals. It is pure in quality, mild in medicinal properties, and has great nourishing power. After taking it, it can generate essence, nourish the kidneys, invigorate the brain, activate blood circulation, and nourish nerves within one day and night. If continued, the above-mentioned symptoms can be completely cured in a short period of time. Only those with nocturnal emissions need to also take "Hymitol Jing Consolidation Tablets" to strengthen the sperm gate and prevent leakage for faster results!</p>
<p>Beauty and Health</p>
<h3>The Sadness of Atrophied Breasts</h3>
<p>—Yao Chongpei, MD, USA</p>
<p>According to world-renowned physiologist and beauty expert Kamdeaning and gynecologist Donpison in a recent "Health Bulletin" published in France, "...a woman's temperament becomes eccentric, her complexion haggard, her curves non-existent, and she is in disharmony with her husband, or unable to conceive, or has difficulty conceiving and raising children. This can be said to have a great relationship with the pair of breasts in front of her chest. If intelligent husbands can understand this and use advanced medicine in time to make their wives' breasts stand tall and elastic, then I believe that marital discord or even divorce in the world can be reduced, and they can also have more lively and intelligent children." This argument contains great truth and is an immortal work that contributes to society.</p>
<p>The reason why the Kang and Tang experts attach so much importance to breasts is that women with tall and elastic breasts must have healthy ovarian function and vigorous metabolism, so their hips are full and their curves are beautiful. At the same time, due to the smooth blood circulation, their complexion is naturally delicate, and their temperament is gentle and docile. Such women are treasured by their husbands at home, and their love for each other is deep, so what is the problem with having children? On the other hand, if a woman's breasts are atrophied, no matter how young she is, she will mostly lose her health and happiness. At the same time, she will also suffer from leukorrhea and menstrual irregularities, so she will naturally be unable to bear strong children, or even lose her ability to conceive. Even if she conceives, the fetus born will not only be difficult to raise, but also be particularly prone to death due to the mother's weakness!</p>
<p>Based on these two ratios, it can be seen that breasts are important to a woman's health and beauty. So how should women who already have this defect seek remedy? I say: Always follow the advice of Kang and Tang and use the latest medicine. What is the latest medicine? It goes without saying that it is the ovarian preparation for women, "Sperm Vitality," which is unanimously recommended by Chinese and Western doctors. After taking this agent, it can nourish ovarian function, invigorate metabolism, adjust menstruation, and eliminate all symptoms of leukorrhea, cold uterus, and infertility like a candle illuminating ghosts, in a short period of time, restore the health and beauty that women should have, and make breasts stand tall and attractive.</p>
<h3>Serious Harm and Treatment of Nocturnal Emissions, Venereal Disease Specialist Zhan Nianceng</h3>
<p>Based on my medical experience, nine out of ten young men with a sallow complexion and thin physique suffer from nocturnal emission. At the same time, nine out of ten patients with nocturnal emission have their origins in masturbation. Masturbation is an easy bad habit for young people to fall into during puberty. Initially, it is caused by the stimulation of hormones in the body and the urge for curiosity. However, young people have weak willpower and know the harm it causes, but cannot stop themselves from repeating it two or three times, so it is easy to form a habit. Later, driven by the force of "habit becomes nature," it is difficult to correct the bad habit. By the time they grow older, after repeated efforts, they finally quit masturbation or reduce the frequency of masturbation, but their sexual function has been damaged, and nocturnal emission follows.</p>
<p>Once nocturnal emission occurs, the most precious essence in the human body is like having a leaky vessel that cannot be controlled. In the early stages, the symptoms are mild, and emissions occur during sleep due to dreams. Later, emissions occur without dreams, and even during the day. Some even have seminal fluid leaking out during urination or defecation. This is caused by the aggravation of nocturnal emission leading to spermatorrhea and sperm leakage. Although the water of the rivers flows eastward every day, water has a cycle, so there is no place that dries up! Now, with the small amount of seminal fluid produced physiologically, and such a large amount of leakage, can it not be exhausted? If the seminal fluid is exhausted, hundreds of diseases will inevitably arise. The most obvious symptoms are brain weakness, physical thinness, forgetfulness, insomnia, palpitations, timidity, lower back pain, kidney deficiency, impotence, scattered energy, and incomplete development, to name just a few. If such young people get married, they will not only fail to fulfill their human duties in married life, causing their wives to hate them and leading to family tragedies! How can they compete with others and gain superiority in their careers and academics, and will inevitably be in a position of inferiority! However, nocturnal emission is not an incurable disease. In today's flourishing medical world, there is the invention of effective medicines. Patients must take "Hymitol Essence Strengthening Tablets," so that nocturnal emission can be cured. If the above-mentioned symptoms have been caused by nocturnal emission, they must also take the gonadotropic hormone preparation "Sperm Vitality" to nourish the brain and kidneys, increase essence and blood, and completely restore health in a short period of time. If patients can come to this clinic in person and be diagnosed by an expert doctor, and receive scientific therapies such as electrotherapy, injections, and surgery, a cure can be guaranteed.

<h3>Yarn and Cotton Yarn Actually "Bidding for Gold," White Tigers Serving as Yellow Tigers, Six or Seven Thousand Bales as Football Chips</h3>
<p>The trend in the yarn market has entered a state of disorder. In reality, most people are optimistic, and the bottom has already risen by 500 yuan from when it was alarming. Therefore, although the market looks to be rising, no one dares to hold it for too long when encountering storms. Both buyers and sellers are in a state of uncertainty. However, general speculators are completely treating cotton yarn as "bidding for gold" (white tigers serving as yellow tigers), and are steering according to the wind. Therefore, although operating for only two hours in the morning, the changes within are truly diverse and difficult to grasp. The football chips kicked around in the market have increased to six or seven thousand bales, and there will be an amazing performance in the future.</p>
<p>The morning yarn market is high because many long positions have not been withdrawn, and a certain large account is still not releasing its tight holdings. Therefore, the public's psychology is propaganda for going long. As soon as the first market opened, buyers flocked in, and 20-count variant yarn rose directly from 1,268 yuan to 1,277 yuan. At this time, the situation suddenly changed. It was said that Blue Phoenix standard yarn prices and actual demand were not smooth. Suddenly, buyers appeared uneasy, and the price fell straight down to 1,256 and 1,257 yuan. When the low price was seen, the long side came again to raise the price and buy, and the price rose again to 1,276 yuan. After the market closed, it rose again. The statistics for half-day trading totaled 6,890 bales, and the market rose by 10 yuan. The amount of each guild purchased is listed below:</p>
<p>Colleagues 6,340, Hong Kong 530</p>
<p>Xiamen 20, Total 6,890</p>
<p>Today, 200 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong for transfer to Yangon, and another 515 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Profitable Purchase of Foreign Cotton</h3>
<p>The current cotton trade is still as quiet as usual, but colleagues mostly feel optimistic, and factories are not purchasing large quantities. The price of cotton purchased overseas can profit 50-60 yuan per dan. Recently, the demand for coarse yarn from the Hong Kong guild has been particularly strong, so the raw materials for coarse yarn are becoming more expensive. The price of Pingguoer is still quite different from the price ratio of 10-count yarn.</p>
<p>In the foreign cotton market, the New York cotton market is firm and lively. The rise in stock prices and purchases on Wall Street resulted in a closing price that was 10 points higher than the previous day. Yesterday, India rose more than one rupee, including forecasts. The foreign cotton trade in Shanghai has been particularly active recently, which is due to the lack of inventory in the market, so the spot price is unusually high. However, due to the lack of goods in the market, large transactions could not be made. But according to the current trend, cotton prices will continue to rise.</p>
<p>Today, 300 bales of cotton were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The new colleagues are about the same price as the previous price, and the purchase has been reduced by about 30 yuan.</p>
<h3>American Bank and Chinese Businesses: Foreign Exchange Transactions</h3>
<p>Foreign exchange market conditions yesterday: HSBC's listed rates remained unchanged. The unofficial British and American exchange markets showed underlying strength. During the afternoon session, due to continuous selling by American and Chinese banks, liquidity was abundant. The US dollar exchange rate once reached $5.90625. However, the closing was stable, with a mediocre market. Japanese banks sold US dollars to the central bank, but the price was similar to that of the morning. In the end, the evening closing rates were: British gold at 3 shillings 8.25 pence, and the US dollar at $5.875, which was an increase of 0.015625 shillings for the British currency and a decrease of 0.03125 dollars for the American currency compared to the previous day. Both British and American exchange rates for futures were aligned with the spot rates. In the afternoon, the Japanese bank attempted to depress the British pound rate in the local market by selling pounds and buying dollars, but this was resisted by American banks and HSBC, leading to a rebound in the exchange rate from 3 yuan 6 jiao 9.5 fen to 3 yuan 7 jiao 0.5 li.</p>
<p>The easing trend was quite evident.</p>
<p>In the early morning, London's large bar prices for near-term delivery all fell by 0.0625. New York's silver price remained flat. London's raw gold was stagnant. Exchange rates between the British pound and Shanghai were flat. The US dollar fell 25 against the British pound, with no market against the French franc. The central bank's listed rates for various currencies remained the same. Banks opened with the following spot rates: British gold at 3 shillings 7.96875 pence and the US dollar at $5.84375. Compared to the previous day's closing, neither the British nor the American currency showed any change. After the opening, American banks were eager to sell, and the market eased. One American bank reportedly sold US dollars at $5.875 to HSBC, and shortly thereafter, speculators bought them.

<h3>The Thickness of Fake Aluminum Coins</h3>
<p>This newspaper published an article about a fake aluminum coin on October 23. Here are a few points to supplement it: Genuine coins are thick, while fake coins are thin. The thickness of a fake coin is about nine-tenths of that of a genuine coin. That is, the thickness of ten fake coins is slightly equal to that of nine genuine coins.</p>
<p>The edges of genuine coins are clear and distinct, while those of fakes are blurred and shallow, as previously reported. If you touch it with your hand, the edges of genuine coins are clearly raised and feel sharp, while fakes feel smooth and lack depth.</p>

<h3>Silk and Tea, Parachute Fabric, US Orders One Million Yards, Using 160,000 Pounds of Real Silk</h3>
<p>According to a Westerner, since the sudden tension between Japan and the United States this autumn, the US authorities have greatly increased the use of real silk fabrics for military aircraft parachute materials in order to implement their new national defense plan. It is said that the Army authorities ordered one million yards of silk parachute fabric from a well-known domestic silk weaving factory a month ago, which greatly increased the silk demand from silk factories. According to estimates, one million yards of silk fabric requires 159,600 pounds of real silk.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods, New Longan Market, Prices Loose but Still High</h3>
<p>New dried longan has been fully opened for sale yesterday, and prices have eased, but are still high. The selling prices of the brokers have also been agreed upon: the top grade is 550 yuan, the heaven grade is 350 yuan, and the tian-hong grade is 220 yuan. All original goods must be sorted and packaged by hand, resulting in only a small profit.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods, Fine Cloth Soars, Plus Zhejiang and Fujian Can Be Navigated</h3>
<p>Domestic cloth prices remained high yesterday. Because eastern fine cloth has soared in recent days, domestic cloth is greatly affected. Moreover, the ports of Zhejiang and Fujian have resumed navigation, and the backlog of goods has a slight opportunity to be cleared. Therefore, people's confidence has increased. Selling prices for fine twill and fine cloth have increased by 2.5 jiao, and coarse cloth, Luanchang, Yihe bleached cloth, and colored cloth have increased by 2.5 to 5 jiao. Bleached cloth and poplin from this factory have also increased by 5 jiao. The street traded over 1,000 pieces of spot and next month's futures of grey cloth, twill, fine cloth, bleached cloth, and printed cloth. Zhejiang gangs traded over 200 pieces of colored cloth, bleached cloth, poplin, and coarse cloth. Guangdong and Hong Kong gangs traded over 300 pieces of colored cloth and colored twill. The northern Yantai gang traded over 100 pieces of coarse cloth, printed goods, and woolen cloth. The blockade along the Shanghai-Ningbo and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines remains the same, and wholesale in the interior is still stagnant.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: The upward trend of white goods, fine cloth, and fine twill continues, soaring by more than one yuan per piece. There are rumors in the market that a certain exchange will auction cotton cloth again. The difference between the middle and lower grades of fine cloth and the high-grade leading brands is too great in terms of grade. The industry is searching for ways to maintain it, so the upward trend of the middle grades is strong. Leading fine cloth only increased by 4.5 jiao. Four Gentlemen serge closed at one yuan and one jiao seven fen per yard.</p>
<p>Exports: Today (25th), there are 275 pieces of cotton cloth being shipped to Hong Kong, and another 50 pieces are being shipped to Hong Kong for transshipment to Yangon.</p>
<h3>Over 10,000 Yards of Woolen Fabric Sold</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a Thursday, with a strong northwest wind, the market for woolen fabric was even more active. Women's colored woolen fabric was even more popular than men's. Nanjing cargo transportation is preparing to reissue foreign fees and can guarantee transportation permits. The demand from Hong Kong and Guangdong gangs is stronger than it was ten days ago. Merchants from Ningbo with some financial resources are all coming to Shanghai to find ways to transport goods. Because the peak season for woolen goods has arrived, all the various gangs on this street are seeing increased actual sales of overcoats and autumn light woolen fabrics. Yesterday afternoon, throughout the city, excluding the stores, it is said that over 10,000 yards of goods were traded directly and indirectly by street brokers. Western suits and Chinese suits each accounted for half. Linings and camel fleece accounted for over 3,000 yards. Overcoats and thick fabrics accounted for over 2,000 yards. The rest were men's and women's colored woolen serge.</p>
<h3>Food, Foreign Rice Arrives in Endless Streams</h3>
<p>The foreign rice market continued to decline yesterday. Green rice has been arriving in crowds for several days, and the goods on the way are still coming to Shanghai in endless streams. Moreover, foreign prices are low, which is the main reason why it is difficult to support the rice market. Yesterday, foreign firms were soliciting orders for No. 2 Saigon rice for delivery next month at only 73 yuan, which is half a yuan less than the previous asking price. People's confidence is weak, and the market is falling step by step. The spot price for original bags of No. 2 Saigon rice returned to the market opened at 74 yuan and 5.6 jiao, which is a fall of 1.5 yuan compared to the previous day's 76 yuan and 1 jiao. The spot market is also oversupplied, as the recent arrivals are all being sold. Prices for all grades have fallen by 5.6 jiao again. Fewer than 1,000 bags were traded. Only 200 tons of original bags were traded. Spot prices were: No. 2 Saigon at 70 yuan and 69 yuan, No. 2 at 63 yuan and 4 jiao, down to 62 yuan and 5 jiao, No. 2 Siam at 61 yuan and 5 jiao, down to 60 yuan, small broken rice at 61 yuan, 60 yuan and 5 jiao, Tokyo super sharp rice from 59 yuan and 5 jiao, down to 57 yuan, broken rice at 52.3 yuan, and Lai Lu at 55 yuan and 55 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, a large amount of foreign rice arrived in Shanghai. The French company's Golden Asia轮 (lun) ship brought over 13,000 bags directly from Saigon. It arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning and docked at the Huashun Wharf in Hongkou for unloading. The Taikoo Company's Taiyuan 轮 (lun) ship brought 8,114 bags from Hong Kong. It arrived at the port yesterday afternoon and docked at the company's wharf in Pudong for unloading. Yesterday, over 21,000 bags of foreign rice arrived in Shanghai. (Zu)</p>
<p>Only 1,000 to 2,000 piculs of new japonica rice and cellar seeds have arrived. However, there are quite a few cellar seeds, and the output is limited. Moreover, the rice cannot withstand storage, so it was sold off sharply at 1.2 yuan, selling for 75.6 yuan. Wild rice opened at 79 yuan. New japonica rice sales are still brisk, and the situation is quite strong. The opening price was high, starting at 75 yuan and 5 jiao, down to 73 yuan. Original bags were 77 yuan. Du Yang sharp rice was still flat, with original bags at 70 yuan. Both thick and thin broken japonica rice had few transactions. Glutinous rice, both domestic and foreign, had sluggish sales to the brewing industry, resulting in a flat market. However, selling prices were similar to before.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Clearly Set, Unofficially Loose</h3>
<p>Wheat flour: Since the market price of Huafen Flour Mill was changed to 17 yuan, the supply from various factories has slightly increased. Moreover, customer sales have been stagnant for many days, and people are inevitably slackening. Therefore, although the asking price for returned goods is still high, there are no regular customers. Foreign flour, because of the lack of fixed orders, the owners insisted on selling high. It is said that they have made some concessions yesterday. The opened price of the high brand was 19 yuan and 5 jiao, and the median price was around 19 yuan. 400 to 500 bags were purchased from this street. The street's retail sales of Chinese factory flour amounted to about 10,000 bags.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday's market conditions were quiet as usual. The domestic and foreign sources were quiet, and the amount of goods transported to the concession was even more sparse. Chinese factories and inland gangs did not pay attention to purchasing because there were no goods to buy, except for several white bags of goods directly delivered to Japanese factories.</p>
<h3>Securities, Jardine Brewery New Shares, Subscriptions Up to Nine Times Over, Domestic Debt Has Started a Small Rebound</h3>
<p>The unofficial securities market started a rebound yesterday. The market has gradually eased over the past few days, and the bullish gangs have gradually emerged. Most of them have made profits from the price increase, and the current price is still high. The bulls are not sure. There is no shortage of shorts. The market price is slowly falling. But yesterday's trading, both sides were quite strong. It is unknown who will win this competition. Although gold opened yesterday, there were no transactions, so the crowd at the bond meeting was getting more crowded, and trading was still quite lively. At the opening yesterday morning, both the Bing and Wu types immediately broke the 60 yuan mark, but soon declined. Tongkang was buying very enthusiastically. Baochang, Yongkang, Renchang, and Lianyi all had demand. Yuxing and Hongda both sold in large quantities. Hengfu and Yichang also emerged. The afternoon closing was slightly small at 0.23 jiao. In the afternoon, Tongkang continued to buy, but Yu's sales were still surging, and Hongda also sold a lot. The rest, such as Lianhe, Yichang, Shengda, and Shunchang, were selling with the wind. After holding on for a long time, the multiple parties were defeated and fled. Type A broke into 8 yuan, and Type B broke into 2 yuan. As a result, they unanimously continued to fall by 0.65 to 0.95 yuan. The total transaction volume was still 2.56 million yuan. A brief table is listed below.</p>
<p>London, 23rd (Wednesday): This morning, the listed market prices for foreign debt and Far East British company stocks were still flat. Only bank stocks showed fluctuations. Jardine Matheson Bank shares rose 2 shillings and 6 pence, priced at 7 pounds. HSBC Bank London registered shares fell 1 pound, priced at 61 pounds. The Hong Kong registered shares did not move, still standing at 57 pounds. There were prices but no market. The rest were unchanged.</p>
<p>Stock transactions: 100 shares of Tianchu MSG factory were traded, priced at 86 yuan and 5 jiao.</p>
<p>Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. issued 500,000 shares of Jardine Brewery stock, totaling 3 million yuan. The subscription amount was 27 million yuan, a ratio of 1 to 9, indicating that those with funds are absorbing foreign shares. Also, in view of the previous high subscription of Xinyi and Zhaoshang stocks, the allotment was distributed on a pro rata basis. Therefore, those who decided to subscribe for shares reserved a place and subscribed for additional shares so that they could get more shares when they were allocated.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the public stock market did not change much. The underlying trend was smear. Trading was scarce throughout the day, because the public still has expectations. However, as soon as the prices of the famous stocks fell, the multiple parties were motivated to buy. Among the various stocks, only Hui Defeng has made some progress. The rest are flat. Rubber stocks are relatively dark, because investors are waiting for the announcement of interest from various companies, so that they can make a decision. The new shares of Jardine Brewery are very popular, and the number of over-subscriptions is nine times over. This is enough to show that the amount of working capital in the current market is truly astonishing. Therefore, if the news turns better, this type of capital can be used for market investment. On the contrary, its resistance is also strong.</p>
<h3>Oil Market, Movement to Move Out Permits, Oil Has No Way Out, Raw Soybean Oil Down by One or Two Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday's edible oil market was gradually weakening. It is estimated that more than 100 dan of oil from Trading Great Factory were traded, priced at 85 yuan and 2.5 jiao, which is a drop of one yuan compared to the previous day. Qing Qi soybean oil was traded for 30 pieces, priced at 75 yuan. Jiaozhou soybean oil was traded for 40 pieces, priced at 74.5 to 74 yuan, which is relatively flat. Peanut oil prices fell sharply, spot goods were down by one or two yuan, and futures plunged by three or four yuan. (It is estimated that 200 pieces of Jiaozhou spot oil were priced at 70 yuan to 69 yuan, 100 pieces of road goods were priced at 71 yuan, 300 pieces were traded in November at 72 yuan to 71.5 yuan, 200 pieces were traded in December at 72.5 yuan to 72 yuan, 500 barrels of Qingdao oil for delivery in November were priced at 101.5 yuan to 99 yuan, 1,200 barrels for delivery in November were priced at 103 yuan to 100 yuan, and 50 pieces of Yantai raw oil were priced at 69.5 yuan). The reason is that over 3,000 moving-out permits were produced, but the inland areas have been solved by the Jiangbei oil transport. Therefore, although moving-out permits continue to be issued, the sales market is still waiting. Moreover, the current costs have been increased by taxes. How can the overall situation develop? According to the current trend, speculation will backfire, or it may awaken the dream. However, some powerful people are still holding on and waiting for an opportunity to act.</p>
<p>On the 25th, there were 205 bags of soybeans, 150 pieces of soybean oil, 250 bags of sesame seeds, 200 tins of sesame oil, 50 bags of raw kernels, and 200 tins of raw oil shipped to Hong Kong.</p>

<p>The trend of the sugar market yesterday was that with the recovery of foreign exchange rates, both coarse white and refined sugar saw declines, and red sugar was also soft. Only Dutch red sugar did not change. The trade association's cleared market price for spot 24 coarse white was 74 yuan for goods stored in warehouses of sugar companies and 70.5 yuan for goods stored in warehouses of other companies, down 0.5 yuan. Taikoo refined white B grade stored at the west warehouse was 72.5 yuan, down 0.2 yuan. DY mark stored at the east warehouse was 68.4 yuan, down 0.4 yuan.

No. 1 rock sugar from this factory was 94.5 yuan, and Jingming rock sugar was 96 yuan.</p>
<p>On the 24th, 4,750 bags of imported sugar arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Finance</h3>
<p>First Day of Cash Forward Trading: Transactions Pathetically Scarce, Fluctuating Only Ten Yuan Up or Down in the Afternoon</p>
<p>Yesterday, cash clam red [a type of currency] commenced as usual with spot forward transactions, with a half-month term. It is said that if there is no delivery upon expiration, the term can be extended to the end of the month for settlement. Throughout the entire day, the price rose and then plummeted sharply, with no vitality in the market and scarce transactions. The total volume for the entire day was just over one thousand taels, and the afternoon was even quieter, fluctuating only ten yuan up or down. The final settlement was five thousand seven hundred and sixty yuan, a slight decrease of seventy yuan compared to the closing price last weekend. The price of gold jewelry in silver shops remained unchanged, and customs gold remained stable.</p>
<p>Fluctuations Exceeded One Hundred Yuan</p>
<p>In the early morning, the “number gang” aggressively raised prices, with the opening price rising to five thousand eight hundred and fifty yuan. Silver firms initially did ten taels of matching trades. Soon after, securities firms and silver firms sold short, and the price immediately collapsed. It is estimated that the silver clearinghouse released twenty taels of gold at five thousand seven hundred and seventy yuan. Later, currency exchange businesses slightly absorbed, taking in ten taels from silver firms, and the price rebounded to five thousand eight hundred yuan. However, gold firms and securities firms heavily sold, lacking counterparties, and transactions became stagnant, causing the price to fall again. Securities firms pushed twenty taels onto silver firms, driving the price down to five thousand seven hundred and fifty yuan. Subsequently, silver firms bought ten taels from gold firms, causing a slight increase of twenty-odd yuan to five thousand seven hundred and seventy-five yuan. The noon closing saw silver firms matching ten taels at just five thousand seven hundred and sixty yuan. The market was quiet, with no fluctuations after the closing either. When the afternoon session opened, currency exchange businesses entered ten taels into silver firms, quoting five thousand seven hundred and fifty-five yuan. The trading floor was even less exciting, with extremely minimal activity. Silver firms matched ten taels, and the price fell again to five thousand seven hundred and fifty yuan. Finally, silver firms took in ten taels from currency exchange businesses at five thousand seven hundred and sixty yuan, the closing price last night, down seventy yuan from last Saturday's closing. The daily fluctuation was one hundred yuan. The selling price of cash firm's base brand gold, when sold in the style of clam red, was more than ten yuan higher, while the buying price was thirty yuan lower. The current posted price of gold was fifty or sixty yuan lower, and hardly any trading occurred.</p>

<h3>A Warning to Shanghai's "Second Landlords"</h3>
<p>— Ding Ren</p>
<p>"It's not easy to live in Shanghai." Lately, I've been feeling pressured by my "boss," with a sense of "the mountain is about to come, the wind fills the tower." However, I haven't "experienced" sleeping on the streets in my life, so I have no choice but to grit my teeth, stand tall, and shoulder the heavy burden—my family—while also having to choose to live in a cheaper house. At the same time, in order to save on transportation costs and lunch money, I have no choice but to choose a place close to where I work. Therefore, I keep "circling" around that area.</p>
<p>Now, everyone knows that finding a house is not easy, so as soon as you see a red slip of paper, you rush towards it like a hunting dog seeing a rabbit, chasing and searching. However, due to the "exquisite eyes" of these businessmen, it's not a "rental advertisement" but an "advertisement," so the person looking at it hangs their head again, feeling disappointed. In fact, second landlords, in order to "capitalize on scarcity," post rental advertisements far away, even one or two li away. The intention of the second landlord is nothing more than to choose tenants, "wait for the price to rise," in order to make a "motherfucking" killing!</p>
<p>But it's hard for friends looking for a house! When second landlords post rental advertisements, in order to widely collect, once they find a "treasure," they are not responsible. They never think to tear down the rental advertisements they posted everywhere, causing people looking for a house to run unnecessary errands, which is really hateful, like a friend who's starving picking up cold rice only to find an empty can.</p>
<p>Here, I have to ask the second landlords to "have mercy"! You blacken your conscience with coal ash, relying on houses to live is not enough, you also have to make fun of others. You should know that other people's shoes and socks are all bought with money, and other people's spirit, energy, and time are also priceless treasures. Don't think that just because your life is settled, you can take pleasure in making fun of people, and enjoy yourselves by "eating houses" and "wearing houses"!</p>
<p>Please second landlords, take a look, such Shanghai will soon be a thing of the past, and your time to "enjoy yourselves with houses" will not be long either. The surrounding evil waves will not allow you to continue like this, and the support of the isolated island still depends on the four million Chinese compatriots. May second landlords repent as soon as possible, so that everyone can cross the river safely in the same boat. Because taking care of everyone is also taking care of yourself; reducing rent and reducing trouble is reducing the opposition between landlords and tenants, which is also stabilizing a basic force of the isolated island. I hope the landlords of Shanghai can choose this best strategy!</p>

<h3>The Fate of the Dance Queen</h3>
<p>— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter 10: The Shoe Problem</p>
<p>She said this, looking at me. I didn't answer, but nodded, letting her continue.</p>
<p>She paused slightly, then continued: "It was on that day—that is, the night before yesterday, the 17th—that the shameless thing happened. It was already two or three o'clock after midnight, and I was already sound asleep when I suddenly heard the sound of something glass breaking. I was suddenly startled awake. Then I heard Miss Wang's shouting. I knew something was wrong, so I quickly got out of bed, put on a piece of clothing, and rushed to the second floor. Miss Wang's door was closed, but there was no light in the room. When I got to her door, I could still hear footsteps on the floor, as if someone was struggling there. Miss Wang was still shouting, but the shouting was very low, as if her mouth was blocked by something, and she couldn't shout.</p>
<p>"I was terrified, wanting to go in, but I didn't have the courage. I thought maybe there was some robber or thief. I stood at her door, mustered all my strength, and shouted: 'Miss Wang!' The door suddenly opened, and a man rushed out, bumping into me and knocking me over. Of course, I couldn't recognize who that person was in the dark, but I vaguely saw him wearing a white short shirt, running towards the third floor."</p>
<p>"Before long, the lights in the room came on, and Master Li also came down from the third floor, hurriedly walking into Miss Wang's room. I followed him in and saw Miss Wang sitting on the edge of the bed crying, the front of her white Indian silk nightgown already torn. A glass vase on the dressing table had been smashed on the floor, the bedding on the bed was scattered, and a small square stool had also fallen over.</p>
<p>"Master Li patted Miss Wang's shoulder and said in a low voice: 'Ah Bao, don't cry, this beast is too shameless, I'll tell him to get lost right away. Look at my face, don't be angry.' Miss Wang was still covering her face and crying. Master Li also turned his head to look at me. 'Jinmei, go upstairs and sleep, nothing's wrong.' At that time, I couldn't say anything, I could only obey him and go back to the third floor. I went into my room, of course I still couldn't sleep. Before long, I heard Master Li also go back into his room. The two of them then whispered and talked secretly. Although my room was only separated from them by a plaster-coated partition wall, even if I put my ear against the wall, I couldn't hear anything.</p>
<p>"I realized what was going on and knew that this cousin was not a good person. I was afraid that he would do something else, so I didn't dare to sleep that night. But until dawn, there were no other movements. Yesterday morning at around seven o'clock, Master Li accompanied his son out, saying that he was taking his son to the train to go back to Suzhou. Before leaving, this Shouqi didn't even say goodbye to Miss Wang. In fact, at this time, Miss Wang's door hadn't even been opened yet, maybe she was still sleeping." She said this, looking towards the window again.</p>

<h3>Record of the Youth Association's Admission of Free Members to the Junior Department</h3>
<p>— Qingchuan</p>
<p>The Junior Department of the Youth Association on Sichuan Road, in view of the current spiritual distress and economic difficulties faced by employees in general commercial and industrial circles, who are unable to enjoy proper leisure and activities, has specially piloted the admission of free members from commercial and industrial circles. Beforehand, few people knew about it, and a total of thirty-four people applied. Although their levels varied, and some did not meet the standards, all were admitted in order to encourage young people to be progressive. The most valuable aspect of this decision at the trial was that the genuine and sincere words in the writings of the thirty-odd people revealed their inner thoughts and told us about the difficulties faced by ordinary commercial and industrial workers in making a living with low wages. Below is a statistic obtained from the test papers:</p>
<p>Age: 23 people are 17 years old</p>
<p>7 people are over 16 years old</p>
<p>3 people are 15 years old</p>
<p>1 person is 14 years old</p>
<p>Education Level: 17 people have junior high school education (including one graduate)</p>
<p>14 people have upper primary school education</p>
<p>3 people have lower primary school education</p>
<p>Salary: 3 people earn between 20 and 30 yuan</p>
<p>11 people earn between 10 and 20 yuan</p>
<p>16 people earn between 5 and 10 yuan</p>
<p>4 people earn less than 5 yuan</p>
<p>Positions: Includes sixteen categories such as miscellaneous affairs, stamps, typesetting, printing, accounting, drawing, bill of lading, cargo handling, book and newspaper sales, proofing, and printing film copies.</p>
<p>The above is just a rough outline to give readers some idea of the situation of working youth struggling for a livelihood.</p>
<p>Young people under the age of twenty are at a time when their desire for knowledge is particularly strong, and their development is not yet fully sound. Like a flower waiting to bloom and release its fragrance, they should be cared for and nurtured so that they can bear rich fruits in the future. However, in fact, many young people, compelled by economic pressure, go to shops or into factories in their teens!</p>
<p>In today's world of expensive rice and firewood, it is not easy to cover personal expenses with a meager monthly income. Some even have to subsidize their families and support their elderly mothers. How can they allocate it?</p>
<p>They frankly point out their dissatisfaction with their treatment, not only with their wages, but also with many of the leisure benefits they should be entitled to. They very much hope to be able to improve. I believe there are many far-sighted people in the commercial and industrial world who can understand the distress of ordinary working youth and sympathize with them!</p>
<p>Everyone must live, and only a life that is lived well is meaningful. Especially for young people, whose minds are active and whose actions are lively, they must be given reasonable satisfaction. The Junior Department of the Youth Association takes serving society as its mission and is piloting the admission of free members from commercial and industrial circles, so that young people who have the will but lack the means can get some spiritual comfort in their spare time and enjoy the same benefits as other members. However, this is just the beginning, and if there are considerable achievements in the future, we will definitely recruit more people.</p>
<p>Finally, I must sincerely encourage the young people who are struggling in suffering. What the country and society will need in the future is definitely us, not the playboys who are obsessed with dance halls and spend thousands of dollars at a time. Work hard!</p>

<h3>The Dionne Quintuplets Begin Their Education</h3>
<p>— Qinghui</p>
<p>Time flies like a stream. In an instant, the Dionne quintuplets are already of school age. For their future, their current education has become a very important matter. Now, let me introduce their school life:</p>
<p>Curriculum</p>
<p>The subjects that the quintuplets should be taught were planned by the Canadian government two years ago. Now, they are learning the most important lesson: service. Dr. Dafoe told them the only motto: "Responsibility first, private affairs second." Although they have many nurses and servants to serve them, they have to do two things themselves. After class, they have to organize their books and keep their desks clean. In addition, they are required to have three hours of classes every day. The teaching method focuses on their thinking, avoiding rote memorization. They like to listen to fairy tales and love to draw. They read English three times a week and practice music three times a week. The afternoon is for rest and games.</p>
<p>Classroom Decoration</p>
<p>In their classroom, all the decorations are exactly the same as the equipment of Old Wells. A set of exquisite toys, a bright red carpet. Several paintings hang on the left wall. One is a gift from the British Emperor. It depicts many children, rabbits, squirrels, small crows, wildflowers, etc. It is the most interesting world of childhood. On the right wall hangs a clock and photos of the quintuplets, as well as an oil painting of Dr. Dafoe. What makes the quintuplets most happy is the strange music chair. When someone sits on it, it will make a "coco dong dong" sound.</p>
<p>New Disciplinary Method</p>
<p>In the past, because the quintuplets were still young, there were no specific disciplinary measures. But now that they are older, a "quiet room" has been specially opened. This "quiet room" is eight feet long and six feet wide. It is very bright and the air is circulating. It is the same as the other rooms in the nursery. There is only a table, a chair, and a few picture books in the room. Everything is very comfortable. Do not leave the offending child alone in the room, separated from the rest of the sisters, so that she feels lonely and achieves the purpose of discipline.</p>
<p>Extracurricular activities</p>
<p>The quintuplets like group life very much. Therefore, they often hold a small tea party and symposium recently. Dr. Dafoe is working as a mentor to help them develop their intelligence. When the weather is sunny, Dr. Dafoe often takes the children to play in the wild. He uses interesting ways, the style of stories, and simple and clear explanations of everything in nature, so that they can gain rich knowledge.</p>
<h3>Group Photo of the Quintuplets, Students Three Years Ago</h3>
<h3>Dan Duyu Talks About "Four Hundred Million Lovers"</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong Correspondence) The moving film title "Four Hundred Million Lovers" has aroused the concern of many audiences who love domestic films. Is it a Cantonese film or a Mandarin film? What is the story about? What about the cast and the director? A reporter from Zhongyi News Agency specially visited Mr. Dan Duyu, the film's production director, who told the following:</p>
<p>Mr. Dan said: Many people think that "Four Hundred Million Lovers" is one of those love-filled and funny films that the southern film circle is particularly promoting, or a lighthearted love work wrapped in some patriotic sugar coating. In fact, the title of this film is just the name of a theme song in this work, but the entire work cleverly weaves a touching story of four hundred million Chinese children striving for the final victory in the great era. Miss Lu Ming, as the center of this work, is a representative of the "pursuer of freedom" among the four hundred million Chinese children. This is her first Mandarin fashion film after coming to Hong Kong. All the actors who participated in the performance are a group of artists with the best acting records, such as Li Jingbo, Jiang Junchao, Zhao Yishan, and Zheng Qiuzi of the Wuhan Chorus. Finally, Mr. Dan also said: Mr. Hu Chunbing has poured countless efforts into this film, so the harvest is also extremely brilliant.</p>
<h3>Xia Xia and Zhou Manhua in the Family of Qinhuai</h3>
<h3>Chen Yunshang Will Star in Two More Films This Year · Busy with Work, Others Are Cutting Ribbons</h3>
<p>After Chen Yunshang finished "Xiangjiang Autumn Rain," she continued to star in "Su Wu Herding Sheep." A reporter from Haixing News Agency inquired about the planned new films, and she replied that the company had decided to produce twelve new works within three months. It is said that she will be assigned to star in two films. Therefore, she has been working hard to shoot "Su Wu Herding Sheep" recently. This film must be completed before the eleventh of next month. She was also asked: "Miss Chen, news of you cutting ribbons for dance halls has been seen from time to time. Won't you be even busier?" Chen smiled and replied to the reporter: "This matter is very ridiculous. In this month, I have been resting at home except for work, and I have been trying to politely decline all social engagements. For the sake of my health, I have to do so. I am unable to help with the ribbon-cutting. Recently, an advertisement for the opening of a new dance hall was published with me cutting the ribbon. I had never talked to them about it beforehand. Even Mr. Zhang Shankun did not know about it at all. The three characters of Chen Yunshang are not a registered trademark. It must be someone else. However, there have been several other requests for me to cut the ribbon recently, but I have politely declined them all due to work reasons!"</p>
<h3>Recent News from the Accompaniment Capital's Electric Company</h3>
<p>— Xinfang</p>
<p>The Education Film Department of Chongqing Central University recently sent three cameramen to enter Xikang along the Jinsha River to take various valuable newsreels, including a total of seven rolls. Two of them were shot in Ya'an, an important gateway to Kang, and Kangding, the capital of Xikang Province. One roll is entirely a record of the residents of Xikang. The other four rolls were shot along the way.</p>
<p>This newsreel is currently being edited and will be sent to various places at home and abroad for screening in the near future.</p>
<p>Recently, the department also sent two capable personnel to the border of Sichuan to take pictures of the local tribal people. There is also a 400-foot-long film, the content of which is a mine, and an educational film about how tung oil is extracted, manufactured, and exported, all of which have been prepared. In addition, a cartoon film alluding to the current Sino-Japanese war has long been completed, titled "Spider and Bee."</p>
<p>Since its inception, although the department has only been around for eleven years, it has already gained a global reputation. The film "A Day in the Countryside" won the third prize at the International Exhibition held in Brussels, Kyoto, Belgium. What is worthy of pride is that the American cultural institutions have repeatedly sent letters to the department requesting to provide films about certain aspects of Chinese people's lives.</p>
<h3>Musical Concert to be Held at Aurora University Tomorrow Night</h3>
<p>The auditorium of Aurora University will hold a grand harmonica and accordion concert at 8:30 pm on the 26th. The performers are the Mass Harmonica and Accordion United Team led by harmonica player Mr. Shi Renwang. In addition to the five famous pieces performed by a hundred people, there will also be Mr. Shi's harmonica solo "Selection from The Merry Widow," Mr. Cai and Mr. Zhu's "Tales from the Vienna Woods" accordion duet, Miss Shi Hailun's "Poet and Peasant Overture," and a harmonica solo. The program is extremely wonderful.</p>
<h3>"Soul-Leaving Tune" and "Soul-Pulling Melody"</h3>
<p>— Su Shaoqing</p>
<p>My hometown, Xuzhou, has a local opera called "Soul-Pulling Melody." Ten people form a troupe, and in the past, they made a living by singing at village and town temple fairs. Since the railway was opened, there have also been traces of them next to the Xuzhou Railway Station. One person plays the drum and clapper, one person plays the small gong, one person plays the clapper. One person plays the long-shaped moon lute, two or three people play the roles of sheng, clown, and miscellaneous, also wearing beards and colorful clothes, but not wearing boots. Two or three people play the roles of dan, called "baotou," wearing fake buns, paper flowers, rouge, women's shirts and pants, but they must step on clogs under their feet. This is a special feature. This kind of fake golden lotus does not appear on the stage, but walks on the ground and sand. Their faces are dark, purely local. However, their art really has unique aspects. The stories they sing include Zhu Yingtai, the Lanqiao Meeting, and Peach Blossom Girl. Ten years ago, I heard a famous dan role sing Peach Blossom Girl (that is, the Yuan Dynasty opera "Peach Blossom Girl Fights Magic with Duke Zhou"). The singing method, expression, walking, and acrobatics were all excellent and worth watching. The tune they sing is the "Soul-Pulling Melody." Since I heard this tune, I have never forgotten the name of the tune. "Soul-Pulling" is aptly named. My soul has probably been pulled away. Unexpectedly, yesterday I accidentally heard a Suzhou girl singing storytelling, and I encountered the "Soul-Leaving Tune" again. It can be said that there is no coincidence. Although the north and south are different in culture and civilization, their ability to "shock the heart" is the same. Now I will describe the "Soul-Leaving Tune."</p>
<p>Xu Xuelou and Xu Xuehua are the female disciples of Xu Xuexing, a storyteller, and the junior sisters of Xu Xueyue. A friend knows them and has repeatedly said that their art is very beautiful. I went to the Nanjing Hotel to listen to them. By the time I arrived, they had already finished singing and left the stage. I was invited to sit in their apartment. Xuexing ordered the two sisters, Xuelou and Xuehua, to sing a song called "Chopping the Sutra Hall" in front of them. One plays the moon lute and one plays the pipa. They stretch their fingers to gently pluck and slowly twist. They open their cherry lips to gently sing. The fun of Dongshan silk and bamboo music, I have already enjoyed it. When they sang the words of Princess Yuying hearing that Wu Han wanted to kill her, they suddenly changed to a low tune. The sorrow was gentle and very moving. This is the "bian zheng (sound paper)" sound that the ancients called. I was surprised by this. After the song ended, I learned from Confucius's example of "asking about everything in the ancestral temple" and asked, "Does the tune that changed to a low tone just now have a special name?" Xuexing replied, "This is the Soul-Leaving Tune." I said, "Is that so? It can be called the same as my hometown's 'Soul-Pulling Melody.' They are both sounds that startle the soul and awaken the spleen. Moreover, they are beautiful Suzhou girls, in their blossoming years. Their sandalwood mouths and oriole voices emit this wonderful sound? How many people in front of the wine are not separated from their bodies? The tune name 'Soul-Leaving' is elegant and novel, and must be recorded. Combined with my hometown's 'Soul-Pulling Melody,' Xuelou sings male roles, acting as the first hand. Her voice is like the reeds of a sheng, and also like the wrinkled transparency of mountain rocks, and the tinkling of mountain springs. She is a natural beautiful throat, with a beautiful and pleasant sound, similar to the vocal cords of the Peking opera female role Xue Yanqin. It is a pity that she did not learn Peking opera, otherwise, I would definitely be able to stand out. Her face should be beautiful and charming, with two exceptionally deep dimples on her cheeks, which is rare in the world. Her charm probably comes from this. She is truly the most beautiful of the Suzhou girls. I heard that she is also good at expressing herself on stage. Xuehua sings female roles and is also very good. There are also two young girls, also from Suzhou, named Xuemei and Xuefang. They are both intelligent and are learning. They also sing a song called "Daiyu Burning Manuscripts" to entertain the guests. I think in a few years, the two girls will definitely take off. I have heard the voices of actors in opera families singing operas, which is common and not surprising. But as someone who knows a little about storytelling, I unexpectedly obtained this auditory pleasure. It is really the first time I have broken the topic. When I returned, I took up my pen and wrote it down. The soft Suzhou accent is still lingering in my ears!</p>
