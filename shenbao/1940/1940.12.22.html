<p>社評</p>
<h3>整理原有薪工資之時機</h3>
<p>自米價奔騰至百元一石、洋米名義上之限價、雖為八十七元、低次遞減，但依然黑市縱橫。麵粉居食糧次要地位，二十元一包之價格，猶以為未足，而亦暗盤層出。此外如油市之操縱，紗布之頻漲；舉凡生活日用所需，無不在所謂「統制」之下，橫徵暴歛，巨細不捐，遂致有貨皆奇，無物不貴；出頂價而得次貨，掛羊頭而賣狗肉，此直接威脅及於社會之各階層者已極嚴重。而間接影響所及，更僕難數，如房租小</p>
<p>租頂費之動輒數千金，電力電話電車以及公共汽車之屢次漲價，內地及上海間之貨運，節節被阻。復因波推瀾助而水漲船高，蓋如公共事業支出驟增，不得不提高捐稅，是仍取給於居民；工商界負擔綦重，不得不取償於售價，終轉嫁於消費者；於是一般居民遂為一切物價所增加之最後負擔者矣。</p>
<p>是在往年，月薪百元者，不失為中等職員，頭等勞工，贍養八口之家，可以無飢餓；而今則饔飱難繼矣。各方各業雖亦有薪津之增加，而其所增所加，往往仍不能解決職工生活上之困難。况此僅就少數大公司行號言，至若一般普通商店，或因來貨吃本倍蓰，周轉惟艱，或因水電捐稅等項所增已多，負擔不勝，或因米價與包飯等項，用一夥計，有一開銷，支耗綦鉅，在此種種實情以及種種藉口之下，　津貼而無之；為之夥友者，誠小工之不逮，乃欲保持一己之生活，尚覺不敷，遑論其仰事俯畜乎？</p>
<p>夫人類之最大目的為生存，故人至罪大惡極處以最大之罪刑，為剝奪其生存之權利。今之物價非已危及大多數人生存乎，抑何辜乎？　以歸因於幣値、此則或由思慮簡單，或由惡意破壞，不觀夫此一時期內，黑市匯率不變，而物價飛漲（至近數日黑匯緊縮，別有原因在），由可知今之物價高漲仍不外　內地物產來滬被封鎖，受「統制」，　囤戶之囤積居奇，投機者之操縱抬價；供求失所調節，物價乃見飛騰，夫豈幣値使然哉。人至窮極無以為生，不甘自殺則不恤法紀，不觀近一年中殺人越貨之鉅案，乃至街頭攫食之糾紛，多於往昔，蓋自有驅之而為盜賊者，可不憫乎。至於數百起之罷工怠工風潮，除少數別有背景，成為附加之原因而外，根本上皆為生活艱難，故在原則上應承認罷工怠工為爭求生存之權利。此後物價如無平準，生活如無調整，則事態之日趨擴大，殆為必然之趨勢。各方之負有責任者；倘必待焦頭爛額，而後悟不早為曲突徙薪之失，蓋已晚矣。</p>
<p>竊以為生此社會，各個人有亟自調整其生活之必要；申言之，在此非常時期，猶必勉強維持其平時之一切享受，例如食必兼味，行必代步，家庭必傭僕，不自量力而為之，是抗違時代，是自貽伊戚者也。同時，各界各　有亟自調整其薪酬之必要；蓋目前薪酬，大多猶以戰前之成局為基調，其能適應社會經濟狀態而作合理之增益者，殆無幾處；或稍加而敷衍之以極微，或不加而峻拒之以極酷，姑莫謂悖情悖理，抑石米百元之事實俱在，孰能枵腹，孰無妻孥耶？</p>
<p>今之各界各業有以津貼為補救者，津貼制度自有長處，較之絕無津貼，尤得頌為盛德。雖然，請作更進一步之檢討如何？原津貼之理論、乃在薪工為經常之負擔，津貼為臨時之支出，若一經將薪工調整，永為定額，則營業費用膨脹，盈虧無把握而伸縮無餘地，自非事業之福，故寗願用津貼以彌補薪工之不足，未便遽爾調整薪工。此其見解，好在穩　，病在黏滯；蓋物價高昂至如此地步，斷非一時可望驟跌。若回復戰前原狀，殆不可能。即使有之，亦必經過相當之曲折迴旋，其時間必不在邇，不知迄何年月也。不特此也，今之戰事，國家民族澈底澈骨之大事也，精神物質，無一不在此革彼興，老死新生之中；若戰後一切，即如物價與薪工，竟然回復戰前原狀，則亦隱憂孔多，斷非國族社會之福。主持事業者，倘能明鑒及此，及時更張，則又何必黏滯於津貼制度乎？津貼與加薪，為數未必懸殊，然薪工而作合理調整，則所予職工之鼓勵，所裨事業之精神，有非同數之津貼所得同日而語者矣。瞬將易歲，各界各業其熟審之乎。</p>

<p>歐戰叢談（廿）（六）</p>
<h3>英國王后在前綫</h3>
<p>在德國空軍對英閃電戰發動之始，英王王却和也進過防空室躱避·那時候大的有四十個人，正在一處警察局的地下后躱避空襲，忽然間，王和后御駕蒞止，大家不勝欣奇。有些人只好把見不得人面的茶拿出來，獻於御前，可是王和后若無其事的與大家有說有笑，直至警報解除爲止）。</p>
<p>戰時期中，他們出巡之舉，地點時間事前並不公佈，因之歡迎的人數較的少。隨從他們的祗有一兩個人，也許就是當地的市長或市參議會議長之流，伴護着他們。一切都比較承平之時爲簡便，格外顯得密切，結果王后的本來面目，如她的雍容儀態，和藹可親之處，益覺顯著了。攝影者對於王后影片的攝取，往往未恰后意，因爲從沒有人能把她的眞相曲爲傳達。其實就她的膚色而論，光潤無疵，倒也够得上美的條件。這種事實，現在大家多已知道，因爲她所到之地，莫不有目共賞呀。</p>
<p>王室的內庭生活也因戰事而大受影響。從前英王和他的弟兄們常在一起，王后則陪伴瑪麗母后之時爲多。現在瑪麗后常住鄕間。她在戰事未發生前，卽已善爲退隱怡養，使王和后得以較無牽制。格羅斯德公和坎特公及他們的家庭雀不多都已不在倫敦，男子們各有公職——格羅斯德公曾隨軍在法國境內服役，甘特公則在空軍和海軍服役。英王於戰事發生之後，卽下令把王族服式盡改爲軍裝，並表示他海軍裝外，其他服裝概不上身。</p>
<p>此外，爲了戰事的緣故，英王旅行的時候較平時爲多。從前王與后每住一地，總是厮守在一起的，現在英王往往單獨出行，往視飛機塲，軍港和兵站等，一連至數日之久。王后對於軍隊，不常前往，除非她是這一隊的名譽司令。話雖如此，她因爲地位關係，究竟所見的軍隊，比任何女人爲多</p>
<p>最後，英國王室對於疏散孩童的滋味亦已親自嘗到。伊麗莎白和瑪麗羅斯兩位公主，在戰事發生之初，卽撤離倫敦。王后有時候一連數星期不能和她們見面。她又和其他居留倫敦的許多母親一樣，當倫敦沒有空襲警報，而英國其他各地不斷遭受德機轟炸時，担心着她兒女的安全哩。</p>
<p>白金罕宮中的宴會咸已完全停止。宮中的執事人員，也因投軍服役，人數减至最小限度。王后的一位常務秘書現已入伍，他的職務改由副秘書担任，這位副秘書在倫教也是奉有軍職的。宮中如偶有宴會也和其他各處一樣，都在白畫舉行，改吃中飯。因爲在晚上，燈火管制和運輸困難等，一切都感覺不方便。</p>
<p>邱吉爾首相每星期入宮一次，其他各部大臣，允其是新任職而年齡較輕的，入宮的决數較少。（入宮之時大多款以午宴，俾王與各大臣得有接近機會。）其他午宴之賓客爲數不多，時期亦相隔甚久。王后的親戚，凡在倫敦服軍役的，常常入宮訪問，她的老朋友亦復如此。此種午宴的菜肴甚爲簡單，不過三道菜模樣。當然，王宮也和平民一樣，所有日用食品等咸實行計口受糧之制。英王的分配額比起兵士還要少。</p>
<p>宮中每星期舉行縫紉會，由后主理其事，但自閃電戰發起以來，此會卽經取消。王后則個人做些編結工作，做些襪子，圍巾等零星東西，作爲犒軍之用。王后對於各慈善組織雖很熱心參加，然向不願叫人知道得詳細。凡是她故鄉蘇格蘭的賑濟事務，她無不唯力是視，至於其他的慈善機關，受她實益的指不勝屈。（完）</p>

<p>德國邊界　維希內閣之屢次集議、定係法德關係中有新發展所致、而促成此發展者、爲賴伐爾之免職與德使亞貝資之來游、據維希傳來之消息、貝當上將與佛蘭亭外長皆願徇亞貝資之請、使法德經濟關係愈臻密且有以義國爲其保護國之嫌疑也、此間猜測義國或願單獨媾和、而以巴陀格里奧將軍爲義國之貝當、此種推測、面與事實相去尚遠、然亦人言嘖嘖矣、駐義美大使斐利浦斯之復往羅馬、可視爲甚饒意義、殆美國亦認義國或有一日需耍議和歟、此間人士覺德國取道白倫納山隘或假道法境進兵義國之說、乃德國有意傳出、旨在疏懈英方防德侵英之準備耳、（二十一日路透社電）</p>

<h3>維希地位依希望曖昧不明　傳德方提出三項要求　對貝當行施重大壓力</h3>
<p>倫敦　維希地位現猶曖昧不明、惟貝當政府刻遇有嚴重雞題、則無疑問、觀於內閣會議之繼續舉行，可見重大發展刻在醞釀中、切實情報尚無所聞、故何者爲法政府現所熟慮之問題、僅可推測知之、英國報紙指出下述三種問題、殆於維希政府連日會議之原因、（一）德人要求使用地中海法國口岸、（二）德人要求准許德軍假道入義、（三）德人耍求起用賴伐爾重入內閣、但不必復其原職、關於第一點、如德方能將其軍艦駛人地中海、則義國根據地儘可供其利用、故德方能否從法國海港獲有多大利益、殊堪疑問、關於第二點、德國之意殆欲佔領義國北部、以防義國抵抗力之完全崩潰、義軍崩潰之可能性今已較前爲可信、至於賴伐爾復職問題、德方似不以賴氏出獄爲滿足、不切、惟超過休戰協定之德國要求、貝當將拒絕之、貝當之所恃者、則爲魏剛將軍之在非洲、聞貝當已允對亞貝資給予讓步、如解放白里隆（傳說與賴伐爾同被拘禁者）而任爲駐被佔領區之法方代表卽其一也、德方似已知賴伐爾太失信任、縱復職亦無助於德方、故擇白里隆以代之、惟法德局勢目前未必遽有多大變化、德國現已支配法國工業，如德國竟提出軍事性質之要求、則將冒强迫貝當辭職、而使魏剛將軍在非舉兵抗德之危險、衆信貝當決不允德軍假道入義、如德方强爲之、則德方將因法國殖民地之態度得不償失、關於德軍已入義境之未徵實消息、就德國來訊察之、納粹黨人對於如何援助義國之難題頗覺煩擾、蓋派大軍入義、旣不爲義國人民所歡迎、</p>

<p>烚赤塲外跳起二百元</p>
<p>農初以隔昨怠風、人心散漫、開盤銀號出金號二十兩、僅六千一百元、開後金銀號兩幫俱塞、證劵幫某戶亦吐出三四百兩、致價愈疲、計銀號對徹二十兩、告六千〇七十元、嗣因匯市報緊、利多空氣又濃、某金號復撈甚夥、價重上挺、計銀號入金號三十兩、已告六千一百四十五元、後以匯市回長、滙票商開始拋出、銀號多頭吐售、　跌甚猛、計證券幫出銀號二十兩、再入一百元關內、爲六千〇九十元、迨至午刻、市圓轉定、變動較微、結果金號對做二十兩、六千一百元、作當日收盤價、比隔昨軋低十元、午後週六無市、惟塲外因傳下週一、滙豐不再掛牌、停止外匯供給種種多頭謠言、十分囂張、致塲外有買戶而少賣戶、初尚做開六千一百五十元、計錢兌業及證券幫曾進、　時光景已抬至六千二百五十元、雖以後略回、而最後聞高達六千三百元有成交、最後六千二百八十元有賣戶、至半日上落有七十五元、現金號之本牌金售價較烚赤期交低十餘元收進低五十元、</p>

<h3>外匯只上午行巿　故絕平凡</h3>
<p>外匯昨日巿况、匯豐掛牌悉無上落、英美匯暗巿、結果美平英硬、雖華商投機家仍受市上流言影響、傾向扒結、幸匯豐及某美行供塞甚殷、惟緊勢殊暫、不久卽告回平、且有若干華行來市吐售、卒爲滙豐等吸收、惟潛勢頗形鬆動、外行對做本月份美匯已達五元七五、延至收盤、人心稍定、結果英匯三便士五九三七五、軋鬆〇一五六二五、美滙五元七一八七五、與上日收市價相埒、</p>
<p>謠風依舊籠罩</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條、近遠期俱漲〇六二五、紐約銀價平、倫敦生金呆定、匯兌英對美滬等未更、美對英不動、對滬跌三分、對法均無市、中央掛牌各滙如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金三便士五七八一二五、美匯五元七八一二五、與上日晚收價悉同、開後外行肯塞、計華行東亞及日銀行來進、價少變化、計本月份美匯做開五元七一八七五、匯豐掛牌揭曉勿動、白銀平衡稅揭曉增百分之〇·二五、此後人心又受流言激動、投機商扒購、市面軟化、計英行有利給予正月份美匯爲五元六八七五、但未幾滙豐及某美行供給、走勢雖緊告定、計滙豐等塞出本月份美匯予外行爲五元六八七五、嗣見華銀行跟售、價反告長、而　豐暨某美行則來復進、本月份美滙五元七一八七五、且一度外銀行曾對做本月份美匯五元七五、至午收價現貨及本月份美　五元七　八七五、先令三便士五九三七五、下月份美五元六八七五、先令三便士五七八一一五、午後週六無市、比隔昨收市、美匯期現不分軒輊、先令各回硬〇　五六二五、</p>

<h3>煤炭　幾經困難　溫炭始克抵埠</h3>
<p>木炭行情、自溫州斷航迄今、物稀爲貴、步步上漲、蓋行客鑒於來源困難、有意居奇、直至目前存底已罄、市上亦有行無貨、不料日前某帆船由溫州繞道裝來甲種木炭一千七百百担、業已抵埠、幾經困難、歷時兩月、故簍子破壞不堪、同業量桶拆賣、每祖開價二十三元云、</p>
<h3>紗花　狂跌暴漲　紗巿塲從此多事　雙馬上午一瀉念餘元　午後突變狂漲三十元</h3>
<p>紗市益呈狂上狂下、此種情形、全係多空兩方見仁見智、各不相同、以致心神不一、弄成猛進疾退之勢、「外客方面」購進龐大之額、當然有其特別意思、或有一種手　做法、刻而進、刻而出、局外人不得而知也、至於巿塲上言、內行視實銷不起、雜牌紗價爲廉、大都放棄、且有翻空模樣、一般小銀號在市善於投機、漲則看　、跌則看跌、所以一起變動、則造成恐怖局面、就如斯情形觀測、前途尚有意料不及之表演也、今日有棉紗一千四百五十五件運香港。</p>
<p>雙馬晨開因日午後有人放空、目議論大致看鬆、跌後要買進、所以出多進少、市面當然下疲、價爲一千三百四十五元、少頃跌至一千三百四十一元、此詩多方亦出來爭持、旋聞外匯仍帶軟化、徐徐而上升至一千三百叫十九元、價格一高、多說謂現貨無交易、空頭大施活動、市况微微下降、豈料一鬆、所謂檯面上之搶帽子之輩專鬥望風下手、乘機高壓、紛紛拋賣、一時人心紛亂只聞叫賣聲、市盤猶如流水、直瀉至一千三百二十二元、買者均萎縮不敢　手、霎時間外客突來搜羅幾包、消息　至、市塲急愛、跳至一千三百三十五元、風勢轉弱爲强、變者竟寥寥無幾、查平日　成交統計六千八百包、行情　十支雙馬價比上日　二十　元、</p>
<p>紗市午後飛漲三十元、紗布交易所中流動掮客、大家要進雙馬、目傳紛紜、謂黃金暗盤大跳、因此收買者接踵而來、二十支雙馬　跳二十元、　做一千三百四十元、再做一千三百五十五元、證券交易所中價爲　千三百五十八元、最後做至一千三百六十四五元、欲進靴覓、猶似珍寶、上午之冷度十變而如此之熱、可想投機者神　變化之迅速也、</p>
<h3>棉花津銷漸動</h3>
<p>現棉情况安靜如常、不過廠方未曾發展、然紗市步步前進、　脣齒相依之棉市、當然亦有痛癢關係、目前尚在平定之境耳、</p>
<p>另訊、外棉市價、紐的棉市、晨初先因受買方之壓力而漲、後又因現貨商之賣出、及一部份多頭了結、結巢收盤價格　之上日跌落一二磅音、印度市况、日來電綫受阻、尚未收到、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、日來始終靜寂異常、廠方心思、不悉何故、　淡薄至此、津方對於原棉之採購、已陸續動辦、故棉市前途樂觀也、</p>
<h3>糧食　洋米暗盤依希望堅昂　昨又到米近萬包</h3>
<p>洋米昨巿仍在混沌中暗抬、晨間謠言極　、尤使貨方興奮、各檔中次洋米乃又趁機抬到達頂碼、而依品質論、市價父被暗抬起半元至一元、　市價高昂、進戶納胃轉懈、且日商新　到市抖售、人心略定、午收又回小三四角、惟各檔高米依然檳不出售、不限價之雜色米與期米莫不一致拉起數角至元外、回籠期貨十二月份西貢二號合義貨開九十四元一角又一月合中貨開八十八元半至八十八元、小絞十二月九日九十　元半至九十二元八角、又統裝自八十九元大至九十元、一月合義貨八十三元半、二月建元貨八十四元、共計開出六七百噸、現貨的六七千包、新交易聞日商曾有多起接洽、據說已成議者計一月份小絞一千噸、價八十　元半云、雜牌一號西貢八十七元、八十六元半，二號未開、暹邏亦僅冲一號開八十六元三角、中關火絞亦開八十六元、次八十四元、小絞獨有新豐依限七十九元、開出一千三四百包、碎尖七十五元半、東京碾尖八十元零七角、紅糙七十一元半、七十一元、蕪湖尖七十九元七角、</p>
<p>厚薄粳等國米、到貨續稀、本街銷塲、因洋米難購、納胃旺、故售價在貨主扳持之下、繼提元砠、開崑山斛見白粳九十九元九十七元、特別一百零二元、靑角薄稻斛見八十九元半至八十九元、</p>
<p>糯米來源雖屬不繼、但市存頗豐、而去路仍見平常、是以市色難與他貨抗衡、依然平平、宜漂白元九十五六元、香　白元八十四元至八十一元</p>
<p>洋米繼續來滬、怡和洋行明生輪、自香港運來洋米、已誌　報、該輪已於昨日下午四時許抵埠、停靠羅斯福碼頭、計裝來九千四百七十一包、定今日開始起卸、</p>

<p>洋粉續告平穩、蓋自本客銷化活動以來、雖有巨額洋粉抵埠、而新定已難通劃、更値本廠停車减產聲中、故售價欲跌又止、聞新到大批澳粉、刻正在起卸、總額計三十五萬包之數、執貨者大都把持、不願輕脫、其中有一部份已配定客帮轉口、故市面仍爲撑住、昨開砲台牌與美麗牌價二十一元五角、鐘樓牌二十一元三角、由木客實銷略進四五千包、因値週末之期、且外滙放長、故新囤戶暫乏熱烈　胃市面已入動盪中</p>
<p>小　交易、殊乏進展、蓋以　到兩稀、僅有少數　　配廠售價站定三十二元、日廠方面、欲收期貨，亦無相當新成交、市　情勢、又入擯持狀態</p>
<h3>海味　胡椒迭昂</h3>
<p>胡椒　以來源　　、底存亦漸單薄、而去路更　、於是售價迭升不已、刻市白椒漲至二百二十元，黑大椒爲百十二元、一號椒一百十五元、前後竟好起十餘元、尚看續堅、</p>
<h3>票據抵用時間上一個小問題　——對於外灘退票的一點意見——　季潤模</h3>
<p>根據常例，如有存戶向銀存入即期票據，必須等到存入的决日方才可以明瞭其能吾抵用，因爲銀行方面在收到存戶存入的票據以後，必先交由票據交換所分別入賬，另由交換所分別所屬範圍進行手續，如果是屬於同行的，就在當日下午三時一刻加入交換；屬於外灘（卽洋商銀行）外行（卽銀號·錢莊及非交換銀行）的，另行投送，等到次日各行退票彙齊後，再打分別退還原來收票的銀行，就根據是否退票而決定所存票據的能否抵用。</p>
<p>目下一般的情形，凡存戶在三時之前存入同行票據的槪可加入當天的交換，至次日十一時以後交換退票來後，如果沒有退票悄形發生，那末就可抵用；屬於外行的，較同行的更早，通常在次日上午十時以後卽可明瞭是吾能用，不過收票的時間較同行早得多，通常十一時以後就要收次日的賬；屬於外灘的，收票的時間和同行的一樣，但次日退票的時間却沒有一定，十二時左右來的有，十時左右來的亦有，二時將近來的，也有，二時以後是否再有，因爲並無規定的時間，不能斷言。在習慣上，銀行方面總是根據了二時作標準，如巢二時到了，而並無退票的話，卽可讓顧客自由抵用，這就大體上說，原是可說措置得合宜的。但正因爲外灘銀行的退票並沒有一定到來的時間，就多少有了一點危險性，這是不論對銀行本身，或是顧客方面都有相當的不便，所以我以爲今後對於外灘銀行退票的時間，負責收授的機關，應設法得一標準的時間，藉以减少各方面的麻煩，更進而避免萬一的弊病，這是一點。　（未完）</p>

<p>綫粉干因本市有「市塲」抽佣關係、殊不合算、故客貨直接轉往香港應銷者、達五百包、就申開售者僅三百馀包、因此突漲二十馀元之多、計龍口粉開至一百八十元、靑島一百六十元、亦最近之新高峯也、</p>

<h3>開塲日</h3>
<p>— 編者</p>
<p>孔夫子是我們的至聖先師，也是我國歷史上一位最偉大最著名的人物，無論男男女女，老老小小，識字或不識字的，說起了孔夫子孔聖人，幾乎沒有一箇不知道的。小朋友們都讀過書，當然知道孔夫子，幷且也尊敬孔夫子。</p>
<p>孔夫子的人格，學問，思想，道德，全是超過一切的一切，實在太偉大了。小朋友們讀書不多，自是不會十分明白，有的也許會把他當做虛無的神仙或佛菩薩般看待；其實他的的確確是一箇人，不過是一箇非常人罷了。</p>
<p>小朋友們遲生了幾千年，不能看見孔夫子，就是讀了他的書，除了接受他的許多敎訓以外，對於他一生的事蹟，總覺得糢糢糊糊的。如今好了，你們却可以瞧見這位偉大的孔夫子，出現在我們的眼前，活生生地表現他的一生事蹟，彷彿使你們回到了幾千年前一樣，這是甚麽？原來就是民華影業公司新攝製的一部偉大影片「孔夫子」。</p>
<p>我們因爲尊敬孔夫子，所以也特別重視這部「孔夫子」影片，而爲它出這一頁「孔夫子專號」。小朋友們放學回家，不妨跟着爸爸媽媽到金城大戲院去看看。你在這部影片中可以瞧到孔夫子的爲人之道，而知道孔夫子的所以受人尊敬的緣故，這實在是娛樂中一種最有益處的娛樂，也可說是學課外一種最有意義的自修課。</p>
<h3>孔夫子</h3>
<p>— 康雁</p>
<p>在你們的歷史課本上，已經讀過「孔子」的一課罷？我想還有一個特別的日子，也許能記得更淸楚一點，那就是孔子聖誕的例假日，因爲到那一天，可以放假休息，可以痛痛快快的玩一下，當我在小學讀書的時候，對於這一天，就記得特別淸楚。</p>
<p>孔子聖誕這一天，爲甚麽要放假紀念呢？當然是爲了後人崇拜他那崇高的人格，和不屈不撓一生艱苦奮鬥的精神。</p>
<p>孔夫子，他生在那亂臣賊子到處橫行的時候，他那「正心，誠意，修身，齊家，治國平天下，忠孝仁愛，」千古不朽的大道理，是很難被那些窮兵黷武如瘋似在的傢伙們接受的，他周遊列國十四年，最後只得回到他的老家去，根據魯史，寫了一部春秋，把當時的惰形，一一筆錄下來。</p>
<p>孔夫子，雖然他在兩千年前，已經逝世，可是他的精神，他的一生事跡，關於他的一切古蹟，是一直留到現在。至聖孔子墓，現在山東曲阜，高一丈五尺，周圍五十步，小朋友們，將來有機會，可能到那裏去的時候，是可以去看一看的。</p>
<p>小朋友們！你們對於像孔夫子這樣的人物，感覺到羨慕嗎？那你們就認定他的學設去學習，抱定他的精神，向前去做，如果能學到一二分的話，雖然不能成一個大聖人，也許可以成一個小聖人罷！</p>
<h3>周遊列國的孔夫子</h3>

<p>小朋友們：你們大家都很熟悉孔夫子這個名字嗎？你們只知道他是我國的一個大聖人，認爲他是孔老夫子，或者是孔老先生，並不知道他是一個政治家吧，可惜春秋那個時候，君侯都昏庸不堪，不能聽信孔夫子的大道，所以孔子在五十六歲的時候，同他的弟子子路，子貢，顏回等十餘人開始踏上征途，奔走天下。他們在外面辛苦了十四年的光陰，結果不能爲一國任用，他們在路上遇到最危險的地方就是在陳蔡之間。那時孔子帶了他的弟子準備投奔楚國，可是陳蔡怕孔子一到楚國與他們不利，所以發了兵在半路上阻止去路，將孔子一行人圍困在曠野裏，一共是七天七夜，孔子所帶的糧食都吃光了，連水也弄不到喝，要是他們不衝出去，就得活活地餓死在曠野裹。那時子路心裏怒極了，實在忍耐不住，突然持斧執盾，大喝一聲，衝殺出去，子貢將他一把抱住，說「陳蔡的兵圍了那麼多，你一個人如何能殺得出去？不如靜候楚國的救兵吧！子路還掙扎着要殺開一條血路，忽然聽見孔子在屋內操琴，他的一股勇氣就隨了琴聲和緩下來，他手裏執的斧和盾也不知不覺的放了下來。他們總算僥倖過了七天的工夫，楚國所派的救兵已到，孔夫子和弟子們也就脫險了。</p>
<h3>我要學子路</h3>
<p>— 劉家權</p>
<p>這幾天，金城大影院在開演「孔夫子」影片，昨兒晚上爸爸帶我去看了。</p>
<p>這眞是一張好片子。在這張片子裹，我看到了古代用車，用弓箭，用刀劍的戰爭情形；看到了古代人的衣服用具和生活習慣；看到了聽到了古代聖賢的聲音笑貌；也看到了當時——春秋時代——的混亂，大國侵略小國，臣子殺掉國君，兒子殺掉父親的大混亂：使我得到許多智識，比上了幾課歷史課所得到的還要多，還要有興趣。孔夫子自然是偉大的，允其是他在夾谷之會裏，他的那種勇氣，使强國的齊折服，眞是値得我們敬佩的。</p>
<p>而在孔夫子的許多弟子中間，我覺得最崇拜子路。因爲子路除開從孔夫子那裏，學習了許多學識之外，他是惟一接受孔夫子的那種不怕强暴的勇氣的。他把亂臣賊子斥駡，和圍困他們的陳蔡軍隊打仗，同時，還向孔夫子勸諫，當孔夫子不知不覺間也犯了錯誤的時候。而最後，子路終於完全遵守孔夫子的敎訓，爲了保衛衛國，抵抗晋兵，爲了和亂臣陽貨搏戰，終於戰死在沙塲上。</p>
<p>我愛子路！我要學子路！</p>

<h3>寄小讀者</h3>
<p>— 民城</p>
<p>親愛的小朋友：還有三天就是耶穌聖誕節了，你們在紀念這位西方聖人的時候，千萬不要忘了吾們東方的聖人——孔夫子。</p>
<p>孔子雖是兩千多年前的人物，他的敎訓，直到現在還深深留在人間；他的人格，還是那麽値得後世的崇敬。</p>
<p>孔子最大的主張，是要人們「正心誠意，修身齊家，治國平天下」，意思就是敎人先從改善自己和充實自己做起，然後再一步一步地齊家、治國，平天下。他的一生，雖以說敎爲主，但他絕不是一位淸談家，他能以身作則，去敎誨他的門弟子，他能不辭艱辛，去開導當時的許多執政者；他抱着決心，周遊列國，希望能為天下人講說聖賢之道。他那種以身殉道的精神，便是他所以永遠受人崇敬的主要原因。</p>
<p>過云，我們太把孔夫子看成神化的偶像了，這是錯誤的，我們現在應該澈底認識他：他是同我們一樣的人，他一生的事蹟，正是我們立身行事的最好模範。</p>
<p>現在好了，民華影業公司已把孔夫子抬成影片，一個在書本上爲諸位小朋友所不易懂的古人，現在可和普通人一樣，出現於你們的眼前了，我想你們正好利用耶誕節和新年的假日，要求你們的爸爸媽媽，哥哥姊姊，帶你們到金城大戲院去認識這位東方聖人！相信你們必能在兩小時中，得到最大的益處　祝你們快樂！</p>
<h3>關於孔夫子的兩段故事</h3>
<p>— 潘式</p>
<p>一·杏壇講學</p>
<p>從前孔夫子也敎了很多學生，但是他敎課的時候，和現在我們上講堂的樣子有些不同，他常常看見甚麽事情，或是甚麼東西，就隨時把當中的道理講解給學生聽，使得學生們知道怎樣做一個正直有用處的好人。有時候也要正式上課，敎學生念詩作文，學禮節，學音樂，此外還要學射箭，駕馬車。像我們上體操課一樣，把身體練好了，要文有文，要武有武，將來可以巷國家出力，替大家做事情。他還敎學生要懂禮貌，良心要正，有義氣，不做壞事，不貪多，知道羞恥。他們上課的地方，叫「杏壇」，也許是因爲四週有很多杏樹的原故。</p>
<p>二·農山言志</p>
<p>有一回孔夫子和他的幾個好學生去遊山，到了高山上，孔夫子問學生們將來的志願怎樣。子路是很勇敢的；就回答說：「願意到戰塲上去跟敵人打仗。一子貢是很有口才的，就說：「如果有兩個國家打起仗來，他願意很公正的判別出來誰對誰不對？」顏回是仁愛的，他說：「願意使天下的人大家都有衣服穿，有東西吃，懂得道理，活得很快樂，像兄弟姊妹一樣的互相愛護。」孔子看見學生們都很有志向，便很高興地誇獎他們，鼓勵他們一番。</p>

<h3>清晨的日光　（二）</h3>
<p>上次我們在本報說到耶穌是「清晨的日光」，為甚麽要這樣說呢？</p>
<p>（一）祂是福音的起始：耶穌的福音，不像猶太敎有地域與　族的限制，乃是合乎普世人類的需要的，人不分文野，地不論寒赤，無不可因得聞福音而身　獲福，由認識上帝而生活崇高，由知曉神愛而推愛及人。日光皆照大地，耶穌的福音也照樣普及眾生。</p>
<p>（二）祂是人神生活結合的開始：自來神人之間的界限，總是判若鴻溝。自從耶穌降生以後，世界上乃有「人神結合」的新人生。聖保羅說：上帝藉着耶穌使我們與他和好……」又說：「我們替耶穌求你們與上帝復和」（哥林多前畫五18/20）耶穌自己也曾說：「我是道路眞理生命，若不由我沒有人能到父那裏去（約翰十四6）</p>
<p>（三）祂是死蔭中的一線曙光：聖誕節是親友　聚的機會。這一年中有離別我們去世的新友嗎？去年的耶穌聖誕他是與你歡樂一堂，今年沒有了他豈不感傷！但又何必呢？這清晨的日光已經照臨了！這光不僅是照亮我們生存在世的人，也照到死蔭幽谷裏去了。耶穌不是也曾進入那幽暗的墳墓，第三天復活，打破了幽暗，叫我們都有復活的希望嗎？如果你不能得着這一線曙光中受安慰，那末，天下人間沒有別的可安慰你了！你的傷感，你的流淚，怎麽能止呢？今天你要毫不疑惑的相信，「清晨的日光」已經照臨，願你接受這光，不要再在黑暗中摸索，徒作無謂的傷悲，『因為這光是眞光，要照亮一切凡生在世上的人』（約翰一9）。旣說「一切生在世上的人」，當然連你也在內的，天父並未拋棄你。（二二十五日再登）</p>

<h3>歲尾劇壇新動態</h3>
<p>— 病鳩</p>
<p>平劇戲院，每屆歲尾，例須調整角色，羅致新人，以作新正競爭之準備。今年各劇壇班底均極整齊，角色亦頗少調動，惟各班為增强陣容，現正在分頭添聘新角，彙聞一束，付諸公開。</p>
<p>黃金　　連成葉盛章盛後隊者為武生尙和玉，小生程繼先及鬚生時慧寶等，旦角人才，尙未定奪，尙程時都為老伶工，亦今日劇壇碩果僅存之典型人物。尚之「鐵籠山」「四平山」「神亭嶺」「艷陽樓」等劇，功力精湛，洗練沈着，年事雖高，而英姿颯颯，威武猶昔，一舉一動，胥足取法。繼先嗓雖衰敗，而身手之穩健，字眼之分明，典型宛在，規範猶存，亦可為後輩借鏡。智儂年前曾南來，其大氣磅礴之唱腔，風雅灑脫條在接洽中者，有宋德珠之頴光社，及宋玉茹領導之戲曲學校班，尙未決定。</p>
<p>更新　更新接李萬春後隊為言慧珠，孫毓堃，姜妙香，劉連榮等，在新角未到申前，暫由沈曼華，張韻樓及班底王鴻福等，演唱短期，以作過渡。言慧珠去年隨乃父南來，曾客串「二進宮」等劇，並擁有「三娘敎子」平劇影片，綺年玉貌，風姿動人，年來頗知努力，藝術當有孟普。孫毓堃久未來滬，值得注意；孫伶軀幹碩偉，武功卓絕，「挑滑車」「長板坡」等劇，直入楊氏之室，小樓在日，最愛此子，其藝術之精湛，可以想見。妙香連榮，頻年南來，為滬人所習知，恕不贅述。</p>
<p>卡爾登　移風社角色，向以平均見稱，今秋改組以後，陣容稍見軟弱，而尤以小生小丑武臉三行為甚，小生聞已邀妥葛次江重行加入。小生花臉，尙在特色。國曆新正，仍將演唱老　十天，「六本文素臣」准年內上演。</p>
<p>大舞台　大舞台自排演「神怪劍俠傳」以來，營業鼎盛，開正要角如林樹森，雪又琴，張淑嫻等仍蟬聯。新角聘妥武生張德祿，沈小廷二人，准農曆元旦加入。張伶為南方武生前輩，肚子極寬，沈伶向在濟南等處露演。亦有聲譽。</p>
<p>共舞台　共舞台開正仍由趙如泉領銜演出。近陳月樓北上邀角，已邀妥劉漢臣，楊維娜，張如庭三伶，漢臣在上海係紅底子，演戲以火爆見長，一齣「金錢豹」，曾享盛譽，近以年高，改演做工武生戲。坤旦楊維娜，本北平交際花，下海未久，著譽北國，飾貌都艷如吳素秋，演技亦精湛可觀，當能轟動一時。張如庭久違滬人，某年搭三星舞台時，亦與趙如泉同班，頗不得志，近來藝術，未知有否進步。該院明年擬排「彭公案」，彭公一角，或將屬之如庭。</p>
<p>天蟾　天蟾舞台自趙松樵加入後，陣容增强不少。「黃天霸」本戲，明年仍將繼續排演。該院作風以火熾熱閙見長，故武行人才特多，近因小趙松樵脫離，當局已聘得王其昌，夏君庭二人加入塡坑。王伶演技精到，勇猛特甚，壇演「金錢豹」，與王英武稱一時瑜亮。</p>

<h3>章臺柳</h3>
<p>— 顧明道</p>
<p>五鴛湖儷影</p>
<p>牧齋曾為伊作有美生南國一百韵，可謂嘔盡長吉心血，博得美人垂青。如是肯嫁牧齋，一則傾慕牧齋才華和名望，二則為和陳臥子　口氣，自己非名士不嫁的。牧齋的才名只在陳之上，而不在陳之下，也給陳臥子看看。所以伊嘗對伊的妹妹絳子說道：「隆準公卽未夐絕古今，亦一代顛倒英雄手，餘子碌碌，怎　望其項背？」遂也不嫌牧齋的年老了。徐大娘本是歡迎錢尚書的，力促其成。牧齋不惜阿堵物，量珠以聘，方繼如願而償。這一天在鴛湖舟中行精褵之禮，許多名公　卿，才人淑女，閒得這個　　，都來道賀。天氣晴朗，鴛湖中畫舫如雲，簘鼓喧　，賓　雜沓，齊牢合　，禮儀具備，可以說得十分盛美，韵事傳播在鴛湖虞山之間。這時候牧齋年已六旬，鬚髪全白，而柳如是盛鬍堆鴉，凝脂　體，當時遂有「一樹梨花壓海棠」的　謠。錢牧齋娶了如是，一同回歸虞山，鄕里　竟有輕薄子弟，乘他們彩　行過的時候，向他們的彩　之前投擲石塊。牧齋也不理會，回至山莊，吮毫賦合歡詩四章，以為他日的紀念。遂稱柳如是為河東君，家人都喚柳夫人，把柳如是　待得十分敬　，非尋常小星可比。牧齋又在北山之麓建造起一座五開間的珠樓，題名「絳雲」，取真誥絳　仙姥下降的意思，將柳如是比為天上仙子，萬卷琳瑯。二人朝夕晤對，校　許多異書古本。往往錢牧齋要搜檢某一卷考證，柳如是能够在數萬書卷中某書某卷隨手抽來，百不失一，足見柳如是記憶力的强了。四方名士紛至沓來，絳雲樓中每多佳客。有時牧齋懶得出見，柳如是便出來代他酬應，時或貂冠　靴，時或羽衣霞帔，風流倜儻，在男子中也是罕有，何况巾幗呢？並且伊　羅萬卷，博通古今，所以和客人對答時，清辯滔滔，應對無窮，座客無不為之傾倒。　史佳話，流傳得很多。虞山人一提起河東君三字，人人稱善，大家知道伊是個奇女子。</p>

<p>舞臺裝置家徐　生生，　幾個月前就擬以孤島特　環境下的暴發戶為題材，寫一劇本，最初決定劇名為「良心買賣」，但是覺得這樣一個範圍實在太大了，而且在我們這般正人君子心目中，要想測度這班壞良心者的勾當，實在有點不容易，所以雖經一度動筆，聽說不久又無形中停止了。</p>
<p>也許是受到這般壞良心者的壓榨太痛苦了，更加朋友們的催促，他又毅然提起了筆尖再決定以新身受切膚之痛的米蛀蟲為鵠的，陪以孤島男女盲目的戀愛至上主意者，於是在一個月前一件針貶時代的作品完成了。</p>
<p>在「生意經」裏，我們不僅知道這般壞良心者的自私，陰謀，毒辣，我們也看見了這般人沒落的預兆，雖然我們不相信因果報，但是希望這般混蛋的　跡，許是孤島人仕所企望者吧！所以這裏雖沒有光明，正面的指示，但是陰影的反面，也許更能揭發正　吧！</p>

<h3>Hull Reaffirms Stance: U.S. Far East Policy Unchanged, Determined to Swiftly Advance Great Defense Program, Building Air Bases in the South Pacific</h3>
<p>Washington - Secretary of State Hull indirectly declared yesterday that the U.S. stance, based on maintaining the status quo in the Pacific, remains unchanged. The Secretary of State made this statement in response to reporters' questions regarding U.S. Ambassador to Japan Grew's conversation with Japanese Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka in Tokyo on Wednesday. Hull stated that he had previously expressed the U.S. government's position on the entire Pacific region and the policies adopted by the U.S. in that region. (United Press dispatch of the 21st)</p>
<p>Washington - U.S. Ambassador to Japan Grew's strong declaration in Tokyo was supported yesterday by U.S. Secretary of State Hull, who also stated that the U.S. insists on maintaining the status quo in the Far East, which has not changed. The U.S. government stated in a note to Japan on December 31, 1938, that "The U.S. government reserves all existing rights and does not allow these rights to be undermined in any way." However, this note has not yet received a response from Japan. Hull stated that the U.S. position has not changed. Hull's remarks followed Ambassador Grew's speech. It is generally believed here that the U.S. considers Japan's "intimidating behavior" to be instigated by Germany. Therefore, Grew's speech is a clear warning to Japan. (International News Agency dispatch of the 21st)</p>
<h3>President Roosevelt Announces the Organization of a Four-Person National Defense Council, Knox and Stimson to Participate in the Work</h3>
<p>Washington - President Roosevelt announced yesterday a plan to organize a four-person National Defense Committee during this emergency period, to be responsible for all matters related to national defense production, procurement, and budgeting. Mr. Knudsen, the current Chairman of the National Defense Advisory Commission, will serve as Chairman of the new committee. Labor leader Hillman, who is also a member of the old commission, will be the Deputy Director of the new committee. The other two members are Navy Secretary Colonel Knox and Army Secretary Colonel Stimson. The new committee will have more power than the existing commission. Roosevelt said that he will grant all powers within the scope permitted by the Constitution. He also said that the new committee will manage three major tasks: (1) the manufacturing of armaments; (2) the procurement of items needed for national defense, to be headed by the renowned businessman Nelson; and (3) national defense budgeting, to be headed by Knudsen, Hillman, industrial magnate Stettinius, and Henderson. President Roosevelt also said that Stettinius' responsibility will likely include the cooperation of the national steel industry and the maintenance of a sufficient amount of copper. When asked whether the new committee could speed up the completion of the national defense program, he said that the national defense program is already accelerating every day, and this new plan is simply a way to further accelerate it. (United Press urgent dispatch of the 21st)</p>
<p>Washington - President Roosevelt announced yesterday that the U.S. has established a special bureau to manage arms production and national defense affairs, to ensure that the great national rearmament program can proceed rapidly and that armaments manufactured for Britain can also be produced quickly. The bureau can begin operating within ten days. The decision to establish the special bureau was the result of a meeting yesterday of the National Defense Commission, the Secretary and Undersecretary of the Navy and Army, etc. The bureau has full authority to decide everything, but the decision must be unanimous, without the need for a vote. When reporters asked whether this latest national defense method could greatly increase the speed of the armament program, the Chief</p>
<h3>Germany, Italy, and Japan Plan to Form Mixed Committees</h3>
<p>Tokyo - According to yesterday's announcement, the general military and economic mixed committees of Germany, Italy, and Japan, as stipulated in the Tripartite Pact of Berlin on September 27 of this year, will be established in Berlin, Rome, and Tokyo to begin preparations. (Reuters dispatch of the 21st)</p>
<p>Berlin - The government officially announced yesterday that Germany, Italy, and Japan have mutually agreed to establish a dedicated committee in accordance with the provisions of the Tripartite Pact to implement the treaty. A general committee will be established in each national capital to handle military and political work. (Haitong News Agency dispatch of the 21st) Commander replied that he did not want to say, because the program is increasing in speed every twenty-four hours. (Reuters dispatch of the 21st)</p>
<p>Honolulu - According to unofficial sources, the U.S. government plans to build a new air base in American Samoa (Note: The Samoa Islands are located approximately in the center of the South Pacific, and are a necessary transit point for San Francisco to Australia and New Zealand. They are currently divided between the UK and the U.S.). The address is approximately Rose Island, two hundred miles east of Tutuila Island. The idea of establishing a civil and military aviation department on Samoa Island became popular after the "Samoa Clipper" aircraft crashed on November 1, 1938. Pan American Airlines and naval authorities have surveyed the island's terrain. It is said that architects, engineers, and others have already traveled to the island with preliminary materials. (United Press dispatch of the 21st)</p>
<p>Tokyo - The "Asahi Shimbun" announced yesterday that the Japanese government's decision to send Nomura as ambassador to the U.S. is sufficient to show Japan's sincerity in improving relations between the two countries. The newspaper added that Japan's position cannot be sacrificed under U.S. pressure. (United Press dispatch of the 21st)</p>
<h3>Coping with Domestic Difficulties: Japan Reorganizes Cabinet, Hiranuma Appointed Minister of Home Affairs, Yanagawa Replaces Kazami Akira as Minister of Justice</h3>
<p>Tokyo - Japanese Prime Minister Konoe has begun to reshuffle his cabinet today, dismissing members he considers to be lacking in talent and not fully supportive of the Japanese government's "construction of new political institutions" program. Konoe has appointed Kiichirō Hiranuma as Minister of Home Affairs to replace Yasui Eiji, and has also appointed Heisuke Yanagawa as Minister of Justice to replace Kazami Akira. Baron Hiranuma previously served as Prime Minister, and General Yanagawa is also considered by people to be qualified to be Prime Minister. Konoe's current appointment of these two people to take charge of important domestic affairs, in order to overcome the government's difficulties in the full meeting of the Imperial Cabinet, is of great significance. In the eyes of the political world, Konoe's move is considered very important, because he has dismissed his closest friends, Yasui Eiji and Kazami Akira.</p>
<p>Cabinet Encounters Public Opposition</p>
<p>The appointment of Hiranuma and Yanagawa, who have served as Ministers without Portfolio and Presidents of the China Affairs Bureau since December 6, is regarded by the political world as the Cabinet's encounter with public opposition on domestic issues. The domestic people's opposition to the government's increased wartime control plan has made the Cabinet feel severe pressure. However, according to Japanese sources, the Cabinet is not planning to resign en masse at this time. Japanese sources also said that Konoe has planned to appoint former Army Minister Araki Sadao as Minister without Portfolio to succeed Hiranuma. In reshuffling the cabinet, Konoe apparently believes that Hiranuma is a politician with considerable authority, and Yanagawa is an important member of the military. These two will be able to support the Cabinet and cope with general domestic pressure, and cope with the pressure from the domestic economic world. Yanagawa's appointment as Minister of Justice also shows that the power of the military's participation in domestic affairs is increasing. Before the cabinet reorganization, Konoe and other domestic political leaders held several meetings from last night until this morning. Japanese newspapers have said that this meeting will achieve the strengthening of the "second stage" of the Konoe Cabinet, and the "first stage" was the previous appointment of Hiranuma as Minister without Portfolio. Yesterday, Konoe began talking with various leaders, and met with Hiranuma before the cabinet meeting. After yesterday's cabinet meeting, Konoe had another conversation with Hiranuma. Keeper of the Privy Seal Koichi Kido also visited Konoe from 8:15 last night until 10:00 before leaving. After Kido left, Konoe summoned Cabinet Secretary-General Tomita Kenji to the official residence to discuss matters until a few minutes before midnight. Tomita then visited Ōta, the Secretary-General of the Hiranuma Cabinet in 1939, and talked until 1:00 AM.</p>
<p>Japanese Parliament to Meet Next Week</p>
<p>Konoe summoned five Japanese leaders to his palace residence again at 8:00 this morning. These five people are Railway Minister Ogawa Gotaro, Welfare Minister Kanemitsu, Overseas Affairs Minister Akita Kiyoshi, Commerce and Industry Minister Kobayashi Ichizo, and Transportation Minister Murata Shozo. These nine people are all representatives of former labor parties and large enterprises. This morning, Hiranuma met with Ōta. Because he urgently needed to go to Konoe's palace residence for consultation, he cancelled his planned trip to a shrine in western Japan. Ōta has told the press that he fears he will not be able to join the cabinet. Asahi Shimbun believes that Konoe's reorganization of the cabinet is intended to implement its policies with a strong cabinet on the eve of the full meeting of the Imperial Parliament. The 76th full meeting of the Japanese Imperial Parliament will be held on December 26, but will be adjourned during the New Year period. Yanagawa is the first officer to serve as Minister of Justice, and on August 1, 1898, General Yamagata once served as Minister without Portfolio in the Ito Cabinet. (United Press dispatch of the 21st)</p>
<p>Araki Sadao Will Rejoin the Cabinet</p>
<p>Tokyo - The appointments of Hiranuma and Yanagawa were held at the Imperial Palace at 3:00 PM. According to Japanese official sources, it is generally believed that Hiranuma's appointment as Minister of Home Affairs will increase the right-wing forces in the Cabinet, and in the future, "Hiranuma as the Axis" may become the center of the Cabinet. It is expected that the position of Secretary-General of the Asia Development Board will be promoted by Major General Suzuki, the Director of the Political Department of the Board. Semi-official sources expect that Araki will serve as Minister without Portfolio to succeed Hiranuma. As for Yasui's discomfort in his position, it is said that friction occurred with internal regular personnel. According to today's Asahi Shimbun, Kazami Akira has a considerable voice in succeeding the President of the National Service Association. Ōta, a member of the House of Peers who served as Secretary-General of the Hiranuma Cabinet, told reporters a few days ago that he will join the strengthened cabinet, but only in an advisory capacity. Ōta met with Hiranuma this morning. Lieutenant General Yanagawa is 61 years old this year, and is a classmate of former Army Minister Hata Shunroku and former Minister of Colonial Affairs Koiso at the Military Academy. Arima visited Konoe at 4:00 PM today. It is said that the cabinet changes and other issues related to the National Service Association were discussed. (Reuters dispatch of the 21st)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Opportunity to Reorganize Existing Salaries and Wages</h3>
<p>Since the price of rice has soared to 100 yuan per picul, the nominal price limit for foreign rice, although 87 yuan, with lower prices decreasing successively, the black market is still rampant. Flour, which occupies a secondary position in food supply, is still believed to be insufficient at 20 yuan per bag, and is also emerging on the black market. In addition, the manipulation of the oil market and the frequent rise in cloth prices; everything needed for daily life is under so-called "control," with levies and exactions at every turn, regardless of size, resulting in goods being rare and everything being expensive; obtaining inferior goods at premium prices, and selling dog meat under the guise of mutton. This direct threat to all levels of society is already extremely serious. Moreover, the indirect influences are countless, such as house rentals</p>
<p>the top fees of small rentals easily reaching thousands of gold, the repeated price increases of electricity, telephones, streetcars, and public buses, and the progressive obstruction of cargo transportation between the interior and Shanghai. Moreover, as waves propel the water to rise, it is similar to the sudden increase in the expenditures of public utilities, making it necessary to increase donations and taxes, which is still taken from the residents; the heavy burden of the commercial and industrial sectors, which makes it necessary to recoup expenses from the selling prices, ultimately transferring the burden to the consumers; as a result, the general residents are the final bearers of all the price increases.</p>
<p>In previous years, a monthly salary of 100 yuan was still considered a middle-class employee or a top-class worker, able to support a family of eight without starvation; but now, even daily meals are difficult to sustain. Although there have been increases in salaries and wages in all sectors and industries, the increases are often still unable to resolve the difficulties of employees' lives. Moreover, this only applies to a few large companies and firms. As for ordinary shops, either because the cost of incoming goods has doubled, making turnover difficult, or because the increases in water, electricity, and taxes are already high, making the burden unbearable, or because the price of rice and the cost of packaged meals mean that employing a shop assistant entails a large expense. Under these various real conditions and various pretexts, wages</p>
<p>are not supplemented with allowances; for those who work as shop assistants, wages are even lower than those of small laborers. However, even to maintain one's own life, it is still felt to be insufficient, let alone taking care of one's parents and children?</p>
<p>The greatest purpose of mankind is survival. Therefore, the greatest punishment for the most heinous crimes is the deprivation of the right to survive. Are today's prices not already endangering the survival of the majority of people, and what guilt do they bear? It is attributed to currency devaluation; this is either due to simple thinking or malicious sabotage. Ignoring the fact that the black market exchange rate has not changed during this period, but prices have soared (the recent tightening of the black market exchange rate has other reasons), it can be seen that today's high prices are still no more than</p>
<p>the blockade of the interior's products coming to Shanghai, being subjected to "control," the hoarding and speculation of speculators, and the manipulation of prices. When supply and demand are not properly adjusted, prices take flight. Is it truly the fault of currency devaluation? When people are at their wit's end and cannot make a living, they would rather disregard laws and regulations than commit suicide. Observing the major cases of murder and robbery in the past year, and even the disputes of snatching food on the streets, they are more numerous than in the past. It can be seen that there are those who are driven to become thieves. Is that not to be pitied? As for the hundreds of strikes and work slowdowns, apart from a few with other backgrounds, becoming additional reasons, they are fundamentally due to the hardship of life. Therefore, in principle, strikes and work slowdowns should be recognized as the right to strive for survival. If prices are not stabilized and lives are not adjusted thereafter, the trend of the situation expanding day by day is almost inevitable. Those who bear responsibility on all sides; if they must wait until they are completely burned before realizing the loss of not having moved the chimney early, it will be too late.</p>
<p>I believe that in this society, each individual has an urgent need to adjust his own life; in other words, in this extraordinary period, to still forcibly maintain all of his usual enjoyment, such as having to eat delicacies, having to travel by transport, and having to employ servants in the family, is to act beyond one's means, is to resist the times, and is to bring suffering upon oneself. At the same time, all circles and all industries have an urgent need to adjust their salaries and wages; because most current salaries and wages are still based on the pre-war situation, and there are few places that can adapt to the socio-economic conditions and make reasonable increases; either they are slightly increased and perfunctorily treated with minimal increases, or they are not increased and cruelly rejected. Do not say that it is contrary to reason and emotion, but the fact that a picul of rice costs 100 yuan is still present. Who can go hungry, and who does not have a wife and children?</p>
<p>Now, some sectors and industries use allowances as remedies. The allowance system has its own advantages, and it is even considered virtuous compared to having no allowances at all. However, please make a further review, how about it? The original theory of allowances is that salaries and wages are regular expenses, while allowances are temporary expenses. If salaries and wages are adjusted and become permanent fixed amounts, then operating expenses will inflate, and profits and losses will be uncertain and lack flexibility, which is not beneficial to the business. Therefore, it is better to use allowances to compensate for the inadequacy of salaries and wages, and it is not advisable to adjust salaries and wages suddenly. This view is good for stability, but bad for rigidity; because prices are so high to such an extent, it is unlikely to fall suddenly in a short time. It is almost impossible to return to the pre-war state. Even if it does, it must go through considerable twists and turns, and the time will certainly not be near, and it is unknown until what month. Not only this, today's war is a thorough and profound matter for the country and the nation. In spirit and material, nothing is not in the process of革彼興, old dying and new being born; if after the war everything, such as prices and salaries and wages, actually returned to the pre-war state, then there would also be many hidden worries, which would not be beneficial to the country, nation, and society. Business owners, if they can clearly see this and make timely changes, then why stick to the allowance system? The number of allowances and salary increases may not be very different, but the encouragement given to employees and the spirit that benefits the business from a reasonable adjustment of salaries and wages are not the same as the allowances of the same amount. The year is about to end, let all sectors and industries carefully consider it.</p>

<h3>Mediterranean Has Now Become the Main Center of the Anglo-Italian War; British Forces in North Africa Intensify Encirclement of Bardia; 30,000 Italian Troops Rely on Perilous Terrain for a Final Stand</h3>
<p>London: A Reuters military commentator stated that the Mediterranean has temporarily become the main center of the war. News from the region remains extremely exciting. Italian troops are currently under heavy attack and pressure from British land, sea, and air forces. Bardia has already been surrounded. Based on the experience gained so far regarding Italian resistance, it is predicted that Bardia will soon fall into British hands. Italian Commander-in-Chief General Graziani seems unable or unwilling to relieve the danger in Bardia. According to British aerial reconnaissance reports, the only road available to the Italians has only troops moving toward Derna and Tobruk. After the British cavalry won a victory near Qalala al-Bir, the extreme left wing of the British army, starting from Siwa, seems to have made progress. There is a road from there to Tobruk. There is no reason to believe that the British operation will stop with the occupation of Bardia. The British forces are in an excellent position, their morale is high, and they can take advantage of the victory to advance to Derna and Tobruk, and then conduct a second battle to occupy Benghazi. As for the Adriatic Sea, the British Navy has launched fierce attacks on the port of Valona and even threatened Durazzo. This action by the British Navy will have a far-reaching impact on the war in Albania. If the left wing of the Greek army can advance along the coast into the narrow lowlands between Valona and Durazzo, their progress may be faster than their advance in the mountainous region between Pogradec and Elbasan. It would also be able to encircle and cut off the entire Italian defense system, consuming far less manpower and time than simply forcing the Italian army to retreat on that line. The results achieved would have a greater impact on the outcome of the war. (21st dispatch from Reuters)</p>
<p>Cairo: It was stated here yesterday that British mechanized units broke through the outer fortifications of Bardia. After fierce fighting, they reached Bardia's inner defense line last night. The communique stated that there are still 30,000 elite Italian troops inside the defense line, including a rearguard "dare-to-die corps." They are now trapped and will either die or surrender. It is reported that British artillery is advancing towards the suburbs of Bardia because the city provides access west to Tobruk. (21st dispatch from the International News Service)</p>
<p>Cairo: News received here last night stated that British mechanized units operating around Bardia are charging into the outer perimeter of the Italian defenses. The Italian defenses form an arc around the port of Bardia, 15 miles long. The Italian garrison trapped in the port is resisting the British attacks with all their might. The British offensive against Bardia is intensifying and has reached its third day, creating a state of encirclement. The Italian garrison is well-equipped and trying to resist to the end. There is no news of Italian Commander-in-Chief General Graziani planning to send troops from Tobruk along the coastal road to reinforce Bardia. However, a military spokesman told Reuters reporters last night that if the enemy attempts to send troops to reinforce along this road, they will be met with a head-on blow by the British forces that have already cut off this coastal road. Furthermore, the Italian army's most important transportation line is now under the strict surveillance of British air force reconnaissance planes. If there is any movement, British eight-gun fighter planes can fly in and launch a fierce attack. (21st dispatch from Reuters)</p>
<p>Cairo: According to the latest news from the Western Desert, British forces are currently preparing to launch a fierce attack on Bardia, a key Italian stronghold in Libya. Although the exact deployment of Italian forces is unknown, according to reports from British outposts, Italian General Bardi and part of the 10th Army are currently surrounded in the village. The most formidable defense of the Italian army consists of many howitzers. The desert climate is extremely cold with strong winds. (21st dispatch from Reuters)</p>
<p>Cairo: A British government spokesman claimed yesterday that Italian forces are intensifying pressure on British troops attempting to capture Bardia. This can be seen from the continuous arrival of fresh Fascist troops at the front lines. The spokesman also stated that the Italian army's strong resistance to defend Bardia is not without reason, because the town has treacherous terrain and is fortified with all modern defensive weaponry, making it easy to defend. (21st dispatch from the United Press)</p>
<p>British Reconnaissance Planes Show Great Fearlessness in Gathering Enemy Intelligence</p>
<p>London: A Reuters correspondent in the Western Egyptian Desert reported that British reconnaissance pilots, who flew to Italian-held Libya to assist the British offensive in North Africa, recently told reporters about the British attack on Bardia. They said that reconnaissance aircraft flying into enemy territory in Libya are like the eyes of the British army. These planes show great fearlessness, taking accurate films and constantly informing the British commander of the deployment of Italian defenses in Bardia. Therefore, the British were able to formulate British tactics based on the strength and weakness of the enemy defenses. The main road from Bardia to Tobruk has been thoroughly destroyed by the British Air Force. Italian vehicles and soldiers have to risk traveling along the coastal road. The Italians previously transported many anti-aircraft guns from Solum to Bardia, but the British Air Force that flew to Bardia the previous two nights did not encounter anti-aircraft fire, indicating that these anti-aircraft guns have already been moved. The continuous supply of the British vanguard is greatly aided by the Air Force. In addition to launching attacks, British aircraft also engage in communication and fly to Bardia to distribute leaflets, urging the Italian defenders to surrender, saying "Resistance is useless, you will only die in vain." On Wednesday, a British patrol advanced to probe the defenses of Bardia and encountered slight resistance. The British army did not launch a fierce attack, leaving it to the British Air Force to bomb it heavily. (21st dispatch from Reuters)</p>
<p>Maritime Traffic in the Mediterranean Under British Naval Control</p>
<p>London: Britain has extended the war to the Italian coast. After launching fierce attacks on Italian strongholds, the British fleet has proven that it completely controls the Mediterranean (which the Italians call "Our Sea") and can move freely in the Adriatic Sea (which Mussolini calls the "Inland Sea") without any obstruction. The heel of southern Italy is only 40 miles from Valona, the most important Italian supply port in Albania. However, when the British Navy bombarded the port, the Italian Navy and aircraft did not dare to engage. (21st dispatch from Reuters)</p>
<p>London: The British Navy continues to achieve victories in its operations against Italy. According to an official announcement, the British submarine "Truant" attacked an Italian convoy carrying supplies off Cape Scartivento on the night of the 13th-14th of this month. One enemy supply ship was sunk, and another may have been lost as well. The next night, "Truant" fired torpedoes off the coast of Calabria, sinking a large Italian oil tanker. The ship was carrying a large amount of oil and was sunk while traveling south. (21st dispatch from Reuters)</p>
<p>London: The London Gazette announced last night that six officers were awarded for their meritorious service in the British Naval Air Arm's attack on the Italian Navy in Taranto.

According to British Prime Minister Churchill in the House of Commons on the 19th, the British forces and armaments in North Africa were transported via the Cape of Good Hope in July and August.

<p>Cairo: A British Air Force Command communique stated that the Royal Air Force carried out a large-scale bombing raid on Italian defensive positions in Bardia and Derna, Libya, on Wednesday night, causing large fires. British infantry and mechanized units are still attacking Bardia, but there have been no major changes since Thursday. "Derna suffered severe damage, with Italian barracks, police headquarters, and motor pools being hit, causing large explosions." The British Air Force also departed from bases in North Africa to bomb Valona and Girokaster ports in southern Albania. An Italian plane attacked the British port of Aden on Wednesday night, with no losses. Malta was also bombed on the same night, with little damage. (21st dispatch from the United Press)</p>
<p>Soviet Newspaper Praises British Military Achievements in North Africa</p>
<p>Moscow: Colonel Kononenko, a well-known Soviet commentator, published an article in the "Red Fleet" newspaper today, praising the British military achievements in North Africa. He wrote that the British army has already defeated at least two Italian army corps on this front, accounting for half of the total number of Italian troops on that front. The coordination of the British staff in adjusting the land, sea, and air forces in the Western Desert to attack the Italian army is impressive. The British naval superiority can not only prevent the Italians from sending reinforcements, but also enable the British army to land behind the Italian lines and launch a pincer attack. British military operations in Africa may later affect the Italian struggle in Europe. (21st dispatch from Reuters)</p>

<p>Random Thoughts on the European War (20) (6)</p>
<h3>The British Queen at the Front Lines</h3>
<p>At the beginning of the German Air Force's Blitz on Britain, the King and Queen also entered an air raid shelter. At that time, there were about forty people hiding from the air raids in the basement of a police station. Suddenly, the King and Queen arrived, and everyone was surprised. Some people had to bring out tea that they didn't want others to see and offer it to the royal presence, but the King and Queen chatted and laughed with everyone as if nothing had happened, until the all-clear was sounded.</p>
<p>During wartime, their trips are not publicly announced in advance, so there are fewer people welcoming them. They are accompanied by only one or two people, perhaps the local mayor or the chairman of the city council. Everything is simpler than in peacetime, making them seem more approachable. As a result, the Queen's true face, such as her graceful demeanor and amiable nature, becomes even more apparent. Photographers often fail to capture the Queen's image to her satisfaction because no one can accurately convey her true self. In fact, her skin is flawless and radiant, making her beautiful enough. This fact is now widely known because everyone who sees her can appreciate it.</p>
<p>Life within the royal family has also been greatly affected by the war. In the past, the King and his brothers were often together, while the Queen spent more time with Queen Mary. Now, Queen Mary often lives in the countryside. Before the war broke out, she had already retired to allow the King and Queen to operate with fewer constraints. The Duke of Gloucester and the Duke of Kent and their families are mostly not in London. The men each have public duties - the Duke of Gloucester has served with the army in France, while the Duke of Kent serves in the Air Force and Navy. After the outbreak of the war, the King ordered that all royal attire be changed to military uniforms, and stated that he would only wear his naval uniform and no other clothing.</p>
<p>In addition, the King travels more often during the war than in peacetime. In the past, the King and Queen always stayed together wherever they went. Now, the King often travels alone to inspect airfields, naval ports, and military stations for several days at a time. The Queen does not often visit the military, unless she is the honorary commander of the unit. That being said, because of her position, she sees more troops than any other woman.</p>
<p>Finally, the British royal family has also personally experienced the evacuation of children. Princess Elizabeth and Princess Margaret Rose were evacuated from London at the beginning of the war. The Queen sometimes cannot see them for weeks at a time. She, like many other mothers living in London, worries about the safety of her children when there is no air raid alert in London, but other parts of Britain are constantly being bombed by German planes.</p>
<p>Banquets at Buckingham Palace have been completely stopped. The number of palace staff has also been reduced to a minimum due to military service. One of the Queen's permanent secretaries has now enlisted in the army, and his duties have been taken over by the deputy secretary, who also has a military position in London. If there are any banquets in the palace, they are held during the day, like everywhere else, and lunch is served instead. Because at night, blackouts and transportation difficulties make everything inconvenient.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Churchill visits the palace once a week. Other ministers, especially those who are newly appointed and younger, visit less often. (They are often treated to lunch, so that the King and the ministers can have closer contact.) There are few other guests for lunch, and the intervals between visits are long. The Queen's relatives who are serving in the military in London often visit the palace, as do her old friends. The meals at these lunches are very simple, only about three courses. Of course, like ordinary people, the palace also practices food rationing for all daily necessities. The King's allotment is even less than that of a soldier.</p>
<p>The palace holds a sewing circle every week, presided over by the Queen, but this circle has been canceled since the Blitz began. The Queen does some knitting herself, making socks, scarves, and other small items for the troops. The Queen is very enthusiastic about participating in various charitable organizations, but she does not want people to know the details. She does her best to help with relief efforts in her hometown of Scotland. As for other charities, countless of them have benefited from her. (End)</p>
<p>The Throne Room of Buckingham Palace</p>
<p>One Glimpse of the Bombing of Buckingham Palace</p>
<p>hopes to see Laval live in Paris as a fugitive for a long time, feeling that Laval is a useful tool for the Germans and must not be allowed to participate in the Vichy cabinet. Undoubtedly, the Germans would not hesitate to inflict this kind of shame on the Vichy government again, using this as a lesson that peace has not yet been signed. In addition, there are several other possibilities that can explain the crisis that Vichy is currently trying to cope with by holding a meeting, such as the positions of General Weygand or the French army in Algiers and Morocco. However, more accurate news has not yet been released, so various discussions are of course purely speculative. (21st dispatch from Reuters)</p>
<p>German Border: The repeated meetings of the Vichy cabinet must be due to new developments in Franco-German relations, and the reasons for this development are Laval's dismissal and German Ambassador Abetz's visit. According to news from Vichy, Marshal Pétain and Foreign Minister Flandin are willing to comply with Abetz's request to make Franco-German economic relations closer and give Italy the suspicion of being their protectorate. There is speculation here that Italy may be willing to make peace alone and make General Badoglio Italy's Pétain. These speculations are far from the truth, but they are still widely discussed. The return of US Ambassador to Italy Phillips to Rome can be seen as very meaningful, perhaps because the United States also recognizes that Italy may one day need to negotiate peace. People here feel that the German talk of advancing into Italy via the Brenner Pass or through French territory is intentionally spread by Germany, with the aim of weakening the British preparations to defend against a German invasion of Britain.

<h3>Free French Expose Laval's Treasonous Activities</h3>
<p>London: The Free French News Agency stated that former Vichy Foreign Minister Laval has indeed accepted a German plan to assist Italy in resisting Greece and to make Franco-German cooperation closer than before. This includes German troops passing through French territory to Italy and allowing German submarine forces in the Mediterranean to use bases in southern France. The Vichy cabinet rejected this plan. Laval then suggested that Marshal Pétain go to Paris and then to Versailles, so that he could persuade him of the need to establish a government in the capital. If so, the government would be under the direct control of the Germans and there would be no possibility of continued resistance. Laval not only prepared to risk war against Britain, but also told the Vichy government that it must take this risk, and that it must utilize the remaining resources of France in order to establish the Franco-German alliance on a relatively equal footing.

<h3>Rome Increasingly Uneasy About the Nature of Franco-German Talks</h3>
<p>Rome: The Italian official news agency issued a statement last night stating that Italy has received very little information about the Franco-German talks. However, the Italian side believes that these talks are related to issues that directly affect Franco-German relations. The absolute unity of the Axis powers is an established fact and does not need to be reiterated every time. This is especially true because Franco-German negotiations are limited to issues that directly affect these two countries. In fact, this statement reflects Italy's unease about the Franco-German talks. (21st dispatch from Reuters)</p>
<h3>France Plans to Establish a New Parliament by Recruiting Talents from All Walks of Life</h3>
<p>Vichy: The French Pétain government's three departments of foreign affairs, internal affairs, and justice are currently jointly reviewing the new constitution, hoping to establish a new French parliament. It is stipulated that there will be 460 members in total, half of whom will be selected by the government from former senators, and the rest will be filled by representatives from the French industrial, commercial, and labor classes.

<h3>Vichy's Status Remains Ambiguous and Uncertain; Rumors Suggest Germany Made Three Demands, Exerting Significant Pressure on Pétain</h3>
<p>London - The status of Vichy remains ambiguous and uncertain, but there is no doubt that the Pétain government is facing serious issues. The continued holding of cabinet meetings indicates that significant developments are brewing. However, concrete information is not yet available, so the issues currently being considered by the French government can only be speculated upon. British newspapers point out that the following three issues are likely the reason for the continuous meetings of the Vichy government: (1) the Germans demand the use of French ports in the Mediterranean; (2) the Germans demand permission for German troops to pass through Italy; (3) the Germans demand the reinstatement of Laval into the cabinet, though not necessarily to his original position. Regarding the first point, if the Germans can sail their warships into the Mediterranean, then Italian bases are available for their use. Therefore, it is doubtful whether the Germans can gain much benefit from French harbors. Regarding the second point, Germany's intention is likely to occupy northern Italy to prevent the complete collapse of Italian resistance. The possibility of the Italian army collapsing is now more credible than before. As for the reinstatement of Laval, the Germans do not seem satisfied with Laval's release from prison. However, Pétain will reject German demands that exceed the armistice agreement. Pétain's reliance is on General Weygand in Africa. It is said that Pétain has agreed to concessions to Abetz, such as the release of Brinon (rumored to be imprisoned with Laval) and appointing him as the French representative in the occupied territories. The Germans seem to know that Laval is too discredited and that his reinstatement would not help the Germans. Therefore, they chose Brinon instead. However, the Franco-German situation may not change much at present. Germany already controls French industry. If Germany makes military demands, it risks forcing Pétain to resign and causing General Weygand to take up arms against Germany in Africa. It is widely believed that Pétain will not allow German troops to pass through Italy. If Germany forces this, it will risk losing more than it gains due to the attitude of French colonies. Regarding the unconfirmed news that German troops have entered Italy, based on German reports, the Nazis are quite troubled by the difficulty of how to aid Italy, as sending a large army into Italy is not welcomed by the Italian people.</p>
<p>New York - Roosevelt announced yesterday that the new U.S. Ambassador to France, Admiral Leahy, will depart for Europe on the 23rd, carrying a letter from himself to Pétain, to be personally presented to the French head of state. (Haitong News Agency, 21st)</p>
<p>Washington - President Roosevelt told reporters yesterday that the position of U.S. Ambassador to Britain has not been filled since Kennedy resigned. His plan to lend war equipment to Britain must be approved by Congress to be implemented, but the Johnson Act does not need to be repealed. The new Ambassador to France, Leahy, is carrying a personal letter to Marshal Pétain. Leahy is an old friend of Pétain, and he is certain that Leahy will be welcomed by Pétain, he said. The President mentioned the issue of bases in the Caribbean leased from Britain, saying that existing rumors criticize the lack of immediate progress in preparations. In reality, only Trinidad, Bermuda, and Mayaguana are awaiting decisions. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<h3>Germany Sends Secret Police to Monitor Vichy's Actions</h3>
<p>London - The Free French News Agency claims that Germany fears that the pressure it is now applying to the Vichy government will create a situation that Pétain and others cannot withstand and will have to flee to North Africa. Therefore, it has sent more secret police to Vichy and stationed them at French ports and airfields. The Nazis also fear that French Africa will break away from the Vichy government, so they are proceeding cautiously. However, they are determined to oppose the few people around Pétain who are still gathered against Laval.</p>

<h3>Italy Uses German Giant Aircraft to Transport Troops to Reinforce the Albanian Front; Fierce Battles Along the Coast; No Change in the Northern Battlefield</h3>
<p>Athens - Yesterday's front-line news reported that Greek soldiers drove the Italian army out of Tepeleni and Këlcyrë and advanced north. (United Press, 21st)</p>
<p>Rome - According to reliable sources, for several weeks, Italy has been using German giant aircraft to transport reinforcements to Albania, averaging 3,000 people per day. The Italian army is also transporting new "Fiat" tanks to the Albanian front. Observers generally believe that Italy's rapid reinforcement is the reason for the halt in the Greek offensive over the past week. Regarding the front-line battles, reports from front-line reporters here state that Italian pilots are currently facing extreme difficulties because heavy snow has obscured all military targets and Greek army movements, so Italian aircraft bombing is ineffective. Reconnaissance aircraft must undertake most of the work, but air force activity in some areas must be completely suspended. Therefore, the recent heavy snow is quite beneficial to the Greek army. (United Press, 21st)</p>
<p>Athens - The weather has improved slightly, and Greek forces are more free to move in many areas along the 80-mile front in Albania. In the past 48 hours, Greek forces have advanced deeply in some areas of the front, opening the way for continued progress. The Greek people's determination to fight can be seen in some border areas yesterday. Because of heavy snowfall in many mountainous areas, some roads are at risk of being blocked. The Ministry of Public Security ordered strong men and women in the local area to help clear the accumulated snow on the roads. Before long, this work was completed. According to recent communiqués, Greek forces, disregarding enemy resistance, stormed and captured enemy positions, capturing more than 600 enemy soldiers and seizing many machine guns, etc. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<p>Nanjing - According to reports in this newspaper, although the weather has been poor recently, the Italian-Greek front-line battles are still ongoing. The climate in the Lake Ohrid area in the northern part of the front is slightly better. Yesterday morning, artillery battles were extremely active. Italian and Greek forces had contact with each other. As far as the situation in that area is concerned, the positions of both sides have not changed. In the area along the Shkumbin River and the Devoll River, there were only small-scale battles. The Italian Air Force bombed the northern positions of the Greek army. According to news from the southern border of Nanjing, the battles in the southern part of the front have continued unabated until now. According to semi-official Greek news, fierce battles are currently taking place around Himara. After the Greek attack, they often encounter fierce counterattacks from the Italian army. In the Tepeleni area, both infantry and artillery were extremely active yesterday. The battle in Këlcyrë is still continuing. It is reported that Italy has sent fresh troops to the front-line headquarters, and the Greek army has also reinforced them to prevent an Italian advance. (Haitong News Agency, 21st)</p>
<p>Athens - The British Air Force communiqué issued here last night stated that the British aircraft attacked the ports of Vlorë and Klisura in Albania on Thursday. Vlorë was bombed, and bombs hit the barracks, gas depots, motor vehicle yards, and many buildings north of the city. When the British aircraft flew away, thick smoke rose from the barracks and gas depots. Many bombs also hit the Klisura area, and buildings caught fire. Although the British aircraft encountered resistance from enemy fighters and anti-aircraft fire, they all returned safely. (Reuters, 21st)</p>

<h3>German Aircraft Bombard Britain Madly; Merseyside Area Suffers Heaviest Damage; British Aircraft Raid Industrial Area in Western Germany at Night</h3>
<p>London - Hitler's aircraft roared over Britain again last night, covering at least twelve areas of England, Scotland, and Wales. They concentrated their attacks on the Merseyside area, launching a sharp offensive on Liverpool until dawn today. It was also heard that before dawn, German aircraft attacked three towns in northeastern England. German aircraft dropped high-explosive bombs and incendiary bombs on the Merseyside area for several hours. This was the first air raid suffered by the area in three weeks. Official buildings, shops, residences, hotels, and restaurants were heavily damaged by the hail of bombs. It was also heard that there were very heavy casualties. The air raid on Merseyside seemed to be German aircraft following the strategy of German Aviation Minister Göring, wanting to turn this important British seaport into scorched earth to make up for the inadequacy of the submarines sent by Hitler. In addition, towns in the Midlands area were also attacked. In a certain rural area of the Midlands, a hospital was damaged when a bomb fell in a certain courtyard. Under the flying glass, two nurses and many patients were injured by the glass. However, there were no deaths or serious injuries. In addition to Liverpool, two towns in Merseyside were also severely bombed. It was heard that the large fires after the bombing in the Merseyside area were quickly extinguished. The air raid alarm in London lasted for several hours until dawn today. However, it was very quiet during the alarm, with only occasional intensive anti-aircraft fire. At 12:05 this morning, a town in the West Midlands, although fierce anti-aircraft fire was launched, bombs still landed. A town on the eastern coast was bombed with various caliber bombs, and the sound of artillery caused houses along the coast to be severely shaken. Countless teams of German aircraft flew north over the East Midlands last night, with one team flying over every minute, but they were all flying at extremely high altitudes. In addition, some towns in southwestern England, a certain town in East Anglia, western England, northwestern England, the West Midlands, and Wales were also overflown by German aircraft. Four bombs fell on a town in Scotland, one of which landed outside a public housing wall, but did not cause significant casualties. Another bomb caused minor property damage. (United Press, 21st)</p>
<p>London - The Royal Air Force issued a communiqué yesterday stating that the Royal Air Force flew to the Ruhr area in western Germany on Thursday night and bombed the oil refineries, power plants, and railway junctions there. The communiqué stated, "In the Duisburg area, two large fires broke out. Our pilots witnessed the gasoline targets in Cologne igniting a large fire. Our aircraft also dropped bombs on anti-aircraft gun positions. Our aircraft continued to bomb Essen and Bonn and returned safely to their defenses." (United Press, 21st)</p>
<h3>Halifax Said to Be Appointed Ambassador to the United States; Eden to Succeed as Foreign Secretary; Lloyd George May Join Cabinet</h3>
<p>London - Informed sources here are now saying that the successor to the British Ambassador to the United States will be the current Foreign Secretary, Lord Halifax. Halifax was previously the Viceroy of India and is now in charge of foreign affairs. He has served for many years, has rich experience, and knows the entire war situation in great detail. Therefore, he is qualified for the position of ambassador to the United States. If Halifax accepts this position, then the cabinet will definitely be slightly reorganized. Lloyd George, who served as Prime Minister during the Great War, may join the War Cabinet in a non-ministerial capacity, which is also within expectations. (Haitong News Agency, 21st)</p>
<p>London - It is widely believed that if Halifax does indeed take up the post of Ambassador to the United States, then the current Secretary of War, Eden, will succeed Halifax as Foreign Secretary. As for Eden's current position, it will be succeeded by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, Hudson. (United Press, 21st)</p>
<h3>Soviet-Japanese Relations Have Never Been Cordial and Friendly; Japanese Newspaper Opposes Pro-Soviet Stance, Saying It Will Cause Northern Turmoil</h3>
<p>Tokyo - The Miyako Shimbun editorial advocates that Japan should closely monitor the Soviet Union's attitude, saying that the Japanese authorities must know at this time that if they continue to express a pro-Soviet stance, it will inevitably cause turmoil in the north. The Russo-Japanese War in the past was caused by the pro-Russian atmosphere in Japan. The Soviet Union now wants to compete with Japan for the leadership of the Pacific, which the Japanese should never forget. Although many people believe that Japan and the Soviet Union are maintaining friendly relations due to the Three-Power Pact and the close relations between Germany and the Soviet Union, this view cannot be considered well-founded. In fact, this view has dangerous consequences. The Soviet Union, like China, is Japan's neighbor and is always worthy of Japan's serious attention from a diplomatic and military standpoint. Since the Russo-Japanese War, the relations between the two countries have seemed peaceful, but in reality, they have never been cordial and friendly. It would be rash to assume that Japanese-American relations have already improved because the Soviet Union is now helping countries that intend to create a new world order to a certain extent.

<h3>Havas News Agency Bought by French Government; Transferred to the Jurisdiction of the Intelligence Bureau</h3>
<p>Vichy - Yesterday, the French Official Gazette published a new law stipulating that the French Intelligence Bureau's domestic and foreign news agency, the Havas News Agency, which was purchased by the government, has been transferred to the bureau. The first clause of the new law states that the mission of the new bureau is to collect and supply news to domestic and foreign countries. This public enterprise will be registered in accordance with civil law, and its economy must be independent. The Intelligence Bureau is supervised by cabinet members. Under the director of the bureau, there is an editorial committee and a management committee. The former has seven members who provide opinions on domestic and foreign political issues. The members are the director of the Intelligence Bureau, the director of the Government Information Office, and representatives from the Prime Minister, Foreign Affairs, Interior, Finance, and Colonial Ministries. The editorial committee meets at least once a week. (Haitong News Agency, 21st)</p>

<h3>U.S. Protests Radio Interference; Japanese Consul Delays Reply; Only Says Understanding Can Be Reached in a Few Days; Radio Stations Still Experience Interference as Before</h3>
<p>The Japanese interference with the broadcasts of the American-owned China Federal Radio Station has not decreased yesterday (the 21st), and the Japanese Consulate General has delayed replying to the U.S. protest regarding this matter. According to a spokesman for the Japanese Consulate, the matter is still under consideration, but an "resolution" is expected within a few days.</p>
<p>Radio Station Knows Nothing</p>
<p>The spokesman declined to disclose what the resolution would be, saying only that Japanese officials are currently doing their best to bring the matter to an end. The China Federal Radio Station denies any knowledge of the "resolution." It is said that if any talks have been held to seek a compromise solution to inspect the news broadcasts of the radio station, the China Federal Radio Station has not been consulted.</p>
<p>No Indication of Retaliation</p>
<p>The interference was caused by a Japanese warship in the Huangpu River. The day before yesterday (the 20th), the interference intensified, further disrupting the shortwave broadcasts of the China Federal Radio Station, but not very severely. The broadcasts at the 650 frequency are still quite clear, but the broadcasts at the 600 and 630 frequencies are disrupted and cannot be heard. Yesterday, it was still rumored that if this interference does not stop immediately, the China Federal Radio Station intends to disrupt the broadcasts of the two Japanese radio stations in the city in retaliation. The China Federal Radio Station has remained silent on this matter, refusing to confirm or deny it.</p>
<p>Convention Stipulates Mutual Compliance</p>
<p>International conventions stipulate the frequencies and wavelengths used by radio stations. The frequency of transmission must remain permanently unchanged and must not interfere with the work of other radio stations. If more than one frequency is designated for transmission, the section of the band that does not interfere with the work of other nearby radio stations must be selected when in use. If interference is discovered and a request is received from another radio station for the first time, transmission should be stopped immediately and the frequency changed.</p>
<p>Intentional Interference Strictly Punished</p>
<p>In addition, all radio stations should pay attention to avoiding mutual interference when working. The above conventions are stipulated in the latest articles of the 1940 International Telecommunication Regulations. If a radio station violates the above conventions, it can be reported to the government for this illegal action by the radio operator after a warning is given and the interference continues to occur. Therefore, the Japanese side's interference with the radio station owned by the American company using the same frequency and wavelength clearly violates international radio regulations, and the international community should strictly punish it to maintain law and order.</p>
<h3>Shanghai's Difficult Living Conditions Worry the National Government; Hope for Mutual Assistance between Labor and Capital</h3>
<p>Shanghai's environment is special, with active speculation in the market and attempts to raise prices secretly, hence the name "black market." However, this type of trading is purely illegal. Now, due to these people's deliberate hoarding, prices of various commodities are rising without falling, and the cost of living index is disrupted. The general salaried class and ordinary people are feeling a severe threat. It is learned that the National Government is concerned about the frequent rise in prices in Shanghai and the difficult living conditions of the citizens. If no effective measures are taken to suppress prices, the future of social security is unimaginable. It now strongly hopes that workers in all industries will understand the difficult situation and take the overall situation into consideration, and not take any excessive actions. It also hopes that capitalists will consider the livelihood of workers and embrace a spirit of mutual assistance and cooperation. At the same time, it has decided to order all industries to thoroughly investigate hoarding and speculation. If it is found to be true after investigation, it will report to the authorities so that the relevant parties can be authorized to severely punish them. If all industries can strictly report and stabilize prices, it will not be difficult to solve the problem. The so-called increased costs and expensive prices are just excuses, which the citizens must clearly recognize.</p>
<h3>Suspension of Parcel Delivery to Madagascar</h3>
<p>According to a letter from the Columbus Post Office, the parcel service between the post office and Madagascar has been suspended. In the future, the post office will temporarily suspend the receipt of parcels destined for Madagascar.</p>
<h3>German Ambassador Trautmann Still Resides Peacefully in Berlin; Absolutely Untrue That He Came to China to Go to Chongqing</h3>
<p>Recently, rumors of "peace" have resurfaced in various markets in this city, saying that German Ambassador to China Trautmann has come to China to go to Chongqing to mediate the Sino-Japanese War. Yesterday morning, a reporter from the Dazhong News Agency visited Mr. Code, the information commissioner of the German Embassy, ​​to inquire about the recent whereabouts of Ambassador Trautmann and the situation in the Far East. According to Mr. Code, the ambassador is still living peacefully in Berlin and has not stepped out of the country or prepared to come to China. All the rumors are obviously unfounded. Regarding the evolution of the situation in the Far East, the famous German authoritative diplomatic commentator Karl Meger recently published a commentary entitled "Alien Elements in East Asia," which has accurate insights into the situation in the Far East and incisive analysis and observation on the future of the Sino-Japanese War. German officials and bookstores in various countries attach great importance to this thesis. It is now planned to find a way to send the original work to Shanghai for reference by those who care about the situation in the Far East.</p>
<p>European War Films Continue to Be Shown</p>
<p>Since Germany screened the European War film at the German Primary School on Dasi Road in Shanghai, hundreds of people from all walks of life have gone to the embassy to request admission tickets every day. According to Mr. Code, he told reporters that he was very sorry to those who requested tickets by mail and did not receive them. He is now actively arranging to continue the screening as soon as the work is completed. The previously mailed admission tickets can also be sent out as soon as possible. It is also heard that new films on the recent situation in the European War are also on their way to China. As soon as they arrive, all sectors of society will be invited to visit on a regular basis.</p>
<h3>Authorities Appoint Commissioners to Investigate the Rice Market</h3>
<p>Although the rising trend in the local rice market has been slightly curbed recently, it has not yet been able to stabilize. It is learned that in order to thoroughly stabilize rice market transactions, the authorities of the two concessions, in addition to sending plainclothes detectives to supervise the market's business every day, will also dispatch personnel from next week to conduct temporary inspections of rice market transactions together with the market supervision team, strictly paying attention to the identity of those who enter the market to do business and illegal transactions such as off-the-books trading exceeding the price limit.</p>
<p>Guild Announcement</p>
<p>The Shanghai Rice Grain Industry Association issued a notice to the industry yesterday to strictly prohibit illegal transactions by the industry. "Respectfully, it is hereby notified that, according to a letter from the Market Management Committee of the Rice Shop Industry Tea Party, it is found that the price of rice has been increasing unabated recently, which is related to the people's food and security. On the 9th of this month, an order was issued by the two authorities of the special district to severely crack down on illegal transactions, which has been announced for the record. After discussions between the Soybeans and Grains Association and this committee, it was decided to strictly monitor all members of your association who hold rice market certificates, and should strictly abide by the orders of the two authorities and must not engage in illegal transactions. If it is discovered one day, it will be dealt with strictly in accordance with the resolutions of the authorities and rice industry organizations. In addition to sending separate letters, a special letter is sent to you, hoping that you will check and forward it to those concerned. Greetings, etc. According to this, a corresponding letter is recorded and notified, hoping that you will check and comply."</p>
<p>Foreign Rice Shipped to Shanghai</p>
<p>According to a reporter's inquiry yesterday, a large amount of foreign rice recently arrived in this city from the Saigon production area. The Tess of the Heji Shipping Company arrived in this city this morning with more than 15,000 bags of Saigon No. 2. The Grand Dana of the French Shipping Company also arrived today with a huge amount of foreign rice. The Kaiting and Bushan Gangwei, which will arrive in early next month, are each carrying foreign rice to Shanghai. The ships sailing from this city to the foreign rice production area to carry rice and grain include the Huali, which sailed to Saigon on the 26th, the Qiongli, which sailed to Yangon on the 28th, and the Guiyang, which sailed to Siam on the 2nd of next month.</p>
<h3>British Soldiers Captured by Germany Send Letters Reporting Recent Situation</h3>
<p>According to the Zi Lin Bao, the 1st Battalion of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, formerly stationed in Shanghai, was incorporated into the British 51st Highland Division after the outbreak of the European War and went to France to participate in the war. In mid-June, it was ordered to defend Arrewell, fought hard and did not retreat, and was eventually completely surrounded and captured by the German army. They are currently imprisoned in a German prisoner-of-war camp. The St. Andrew's Society of Scotland in this city recently received a letter from Lieutenant Colonel Bonner of the 1st Battalion of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders from a prisoner-of-war camp, reporting on the living conditions of the captured British soldiers and requesting donations of sweets, cigarettes, biscuits, and canned meat. The St. Andrew's Society is calling on members to donate money to purchase the above items and pack them into parcels to send to comfort the captured soldiers.</p>

<h3>Continued House Demolition on Wangjia Lane by the Japanese; Japanese Spokesperson Claims Nothing of the Sort; 土山灣 Area Blockaded Again Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Japanese authorities in the Shanghai West District, in order to build "Sasaki Road" from the middle section of Great West Road to Yuyuan Road to commemorate the Japanese military policeman who was shot dead at the entrance of Lane 52 of Great West Road three weeks ago, caused another 200 Chinese people to become homeless yesterday (the 21st). Most of those affected by the Japanese road construction plan are shop owners and shops located at the entrance of Wangjia Lane. At the same time, a small number of houses in the lane were also demolished yesterday. Although the Japanese official spokesperson stated at a reception for reporters the night before that rumors of residents in the lane becoming homeless or houses being demolished were untrue, people witnessed a large number of houses in the lane being demolished yesterday morning. At the same time, people living in the lane were also moving their furniture and sundries.</p>
<p>Japanese Spokesperson Denies Everything</p>
<p>The Continental Daily News reported that the Japanese Army spokesperson, when hosting news reporters yesterday afternoon (the 20th), firmly denied the Japanese side demolishing 50 Chinese houses to open a road at the site where the Japanese military policeman was assassinated, causing 300 Chinese residents to become homeless. According to a news report published in an evening newspaper earlier this week, the Japanese authorities had demolished a row of Chinese houses between Great West Road and Yuyuan Road in order to build a road to commemorate the assassinated Japanese military policeman.</p>
<p>Strict Security at the Border of the Concession</p>
<p>Yesterday, the situation in Shanghai's West District did not change much. Areas such as Zhuanbang Yongxingli were still in a state of semi-blockade. The two blockades at the southern end of Great West Road Yidingpan Road and the intersection of Great West Road Jing'an Temple Road still cut off all traffic. Demolition work in and around Wangjia Lane continued unabated. Public buses on lines 1, 2, 9, and 3 sold tickets in two sections, and the route signs for the double-decker buses had also been modified. As for the Caojiadu area, barbed wire was everywhere, but no blockade measures were taken. In addition, the security lines set up by the Public Works Department at the border of the Shanghai West District Concession, such as the intersections of Fuxu Road and Haig Road, Jing'an Temple Road and Haig Road, Avenue Haig and Jessfield Road, and Jiaozhou Road and Singapore Road, were quite strict in searching pedestrians and vehicles. Given the winter defense period, there was deep concern that troublemakers would sneak into the Concession, and Shanghai West District was a troublesome area, so all possible suppression methods had to be taken to prevent unexpected events from happening. West of Haig Road, along Great West Road to Yidingpan Road, special businesses such as small gambling houses, small flower clubs, and telephone rooms sprung up like mushrooms after rain, almost filling the alleys.</p>
<p>Barbed Wire Also Set Up in 土山灣</p>
<p>土山灣 in Xujiahui, Shanghai West District, is the only important route between the French Concession and Caohejing, Minhang, Qibao, and Xinzhuang. Farmers from the suburbs travel to and from there, so the area is very lively. Unexpectedly, starting yesterday morning, the Japanese side suddenly erected barbed wire at the throat of Lane 735 of Pudong Road in 土山灣, strictly searching pedestrians. Small business people carrying various goods were subjected to even stricter inspections. Any goods that the Japanese army deemed to be prohibited were banned from entering or leaving.</p>
<h3>聯美 Airlines Opens New Hong Kong-Singapore Route</h3>
<p>China's transportation construction has made rapid progress since the war. The construction of international highways on land has received great attention, and the opening of overseas air routes has also been carefully managed. It is reported that 聯美 Airlines is planning to open new routes from Manila to Hong Kong and from Manila to Singapore in order to develop its Far East business, with two flights scheduled every week. Relevant parties said that the company's decision to open new routes between the China Sea and Singapore is the first time that the Far East trade center has been directly connected. In the future, the routes can be connected to important commercial areas such as Sumatra and Java Borneo in the Dutch East Indies via Singapore. The extension of this route can provide the rapid transportation tools needed for the United States to expand its Eastern business. The company has obtained the permission of the British side for all necessary conveniences. The opening of this new route will not only facilitate transportation, but also indicate that the US government and business community both advocate maintaining a strong position in the Far East.</p>
<h3>Knitwear Engineers Go on Strike; Workers Anxious and Uneasy</h3>
<p>More than 300 engineers and technicians from more than 120 knitting factories in the city have asked their respective factories to increase wages and improve treatment due to financial difficulties. Wages were approved to be increased by 60%, rice subsidies were five斗 per month, and living allowances were 30 yuan per person per month. At 2 pm the day before yesterday, the Political Department of the Public Concession invited both labor and management to mediate once, but in the end, the labor side was afraid that the management had other intentions, and did not agree because the management required work to resume first, and then direct negotiations would take place. As a result, the matter could not be resolved satisfactorily. The dispute was still deadlocked yesterday, causing all electric knitting factories in the city to shut down completely. It is reported that in addition to trying to maintain order and waiting for a reasonable solution, the labor side is also discussing countermeasures. According to an engineer, their monthly salary is only 50 yuan, which is only enough to feed themselves at a time when everything is expensive and the cost of living has doubled. It is difficult to support their families, so they have no choice but to take this action. Therefore, they hope that the management will follow the spirit of cooperation between labor and management in the past and grant them allowances and salary increases. At present, more than 30,000 male and female workers from more than 120 electric knitting factories in the city are quite anxious and uneasy.</p>
<h3>Japanese Consulate Police Officer Slashed to Death in Nanshi; Severely Slashed Several Times in a Dark Place on Wenmiao Road; Japanese Military Police Conducted Strict Searches Without Results</h3>

It is heard that the Japanese police officer died shortly after being sent to the hospital.</p>
<h3>Japanese Military Ashes; Forty-ninth Batch Returns Home</h3>

<p>The Shanghai Postal Administration is currently issuing postage stamps that are still in the old format and old values.

<h3>Unapproved Banknotes Prohibited from Acceptance and Circulation; Violators Will Be Prosecuted for Disrupting the Financial Order; Offenders Will Be Sent to Military Tribunals for Severe Punishment</h3>
<p>Since China implemented the new monetary policy, banknotes issued by the Central Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank of China have been designated as legal tender. All grain payments, tax payments, and all public and private transactions must be made in legal tender. Banknotes issued by Zhejiang Xing, Siming, and other banks that were previously approved for issuance are temporarily allowed to circulate as usual, but they are gradually being exchanged for legal tender by the Central Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank of China. The issuance, circulation, and exchange of legal tender is handled by the Issuance Reserve Management Committee to ensure its soundness and build confidence. As for banks that have not been approved to issue banknotes, they are absolutely not allowed to issue them without authorization. Now, the Ministry of Finance has issued a special order prohibiting the acceptance and circulation of banknotes that have not been approved for issuance in any place. Violators will be prosecuted for disrupting the financial order in accordance with the regulations on suppressing traitors. If anyone is found to be collecting, transporting, or circulating such banknotes, all the banknotes will be confiscated, and the offenders will be sent to military tribunals for severe punishment. It is heard that the national financial industry and merchants of all industries are complying with the regulations of the Ministry and are refusing to accept or circulate banknotes that have not been approved for issuance.</p>
<h3>Fufeng Flour Mill Resumed Operations Yesterday; Most Workers Automatically Returned to the Factory</h3>
<p>The Fufeng Flour Mill at 126 Moshan Road in Shanghai has a long history and a large scale, with more than 1,000 workers. Recently, the workers of the factory went on strike due to dissatisfaction with their treatment. The details of the incident have been reported in detail in this newspaper. It is now learned that the treatment of the workers in the factory has always been good. Each person can purchase a bag of Old Car brand flour for only 4.5 yuan per month, and 65 pounds of white rice (equivalent to 3斗7升) for only 2.85 yuan. Therefore, the minimum salary for each person is 70 yuan, with double pay at the end of the year. If business is booming, special rewards are also given. The factory has also built a large shouting building and dozens of workers' residences, and has a hospital and a school for workers' children to protect the workers, provide free medical treatment for workers and their families, and educate their children. Generally speaking, this is rare. Moreover, as the source of wheat has become scarce recently, the factory, in order to maintain the lives of the workers, has long saved a considerable amount of flour and rice as a precaution. If the source of wheat is cut off one day and the factory is forced to shut down, the workers will still be able to eat specially priced rice and flour as usual, and their wages will be paid as usual. As for the strike, most of the workers understand the big picture, so 600 people unconditionally and automatically returned to the factory to resume operations yesterday (the 21st). Other workers have not yet learned of the resumption of operations because they live far away from the factory, so they have not come to the factory. The factory is also being generous and will not pursue any responsibility for the workers who have resumed operations. Therefore, the strike at the factory should be completely resolved within a few days.</p>
<h3>British Overseas Airline Takes Off from Singapore</h3>

<h3>All Circles Warmly Celebrate National Revival Day; Promote Frugality, Savings, and Disaster Relief Movement; But No Commemorative Ceremonies Will Be Held</h3>
<p>The 25th of this month is the anniversary of the Yunnan Uprising and National Revival Day. All circles in Shanghai will celebrate the Yunnan Uprising, which overthrew the imperial conspiracy and restored the national foundation, and the resolution of the Xi'an Incident, the safe return of the supreme leader to Beijing, and the promotion of national unity. However, no commemorative ceremonies will be held. In order to support national policies and complete the great cause of national revival, all circles have decided to step up the promotion of frugality, savings, and national construction movements, reduce expenditures, and provide for national construction needs. In view of the fact that it is winter and the poor people on the streets are suffering from hunger and cold and dying in large numbers, and at a time when various charities are promoting winter relief, they will expand their support to provide relief. The authorities of the two concessions, in order to prevent troublemakers from taking the opportunity to cause trouble, have decided to implement a day of alert to prevent such incidents.</p>
<h3>Municipal Council Election Committee Discusses Important Matters; Meeting Scheduled for the Afternoon of the 24th; It Is Said That the Japanese Side Will Propose New Proposals</h3>
<p>The next election of directors of the Public Concession Municipal Council will be held as usual in April next year. However, since the Japanese side failed to win the election this year, although the election of directors is still four months away, the British, American taxpayers, and Westerners related to the British and Americans have to pay serious attention to it and prepare in advance. The Municipal Council responded to the Japanese side's request a few months ago and formed an election committee. The committee is dedicated to discussing the election of directors and has held five meetings so far. According to a report from the 平明社 reporter to informed sources, the committee is scheduled to hold its sixth meeting next Tuesday (the 24th of this month) at 4 pm. The meeting place is still the Board of Directors meeting room on the first floor of the Municipal Council. However, it is said that the nature of the meeting is quite important, because the Japanese representatives will propose a motion in the committee to express their dissatisfaction with the current election system and hope to reform it greatly so that it will be beneficial to them in the next election. However, the system is based on the 洋涇浜 Land Charter, so it is difficult to achieve the wish to reform the election system.</p>
<h3>Two Inspectors from the Police Department Go to Australia to Enlist; Colleagues Hold Farewell Banquet</h3>
<p>Detective Inspector Watson of the Detective Department of the Public Concession Police Department has been working for 12 years. He recently submitted his resignation to the Municipal Council and is scheduled to take his family to Australia in the near future. His colleagues held a farewell banquet for him at the Police Inspectors Association last night.

Wang Yaotang, the former lawyer of the Municipal Council, also attended the banquet and presented Watson, who was retiring, with souvenirs. In addition, Inspector Smith of the Hongkou Police Station has also been approved by the Municipal Council to resign and go to Australia. Yesterday, senior officials of the Hongkou Police Station also gathered with Smith for a banquet in the reading room of the police station. Although they had been drinking and talking warmly, they could not help but feel sad after working together for many years. During the banquet, Assistant Chief Constable Simpson presented Smith with a set of silver tea sets on behalf of everyone. Smith has been serving in the Police Department for 16 years. He is returning to Australia this time and may be working in the military.</p>
<h3>All Detained Foreign Vessels Have Not Been Released; German and Italian Vessels Arrive in Shanghai Loaded with Cotton Cocoons; Still Detained and Not Unloaded</h3>
<p>The Japanese Naval Maritime Police Corps detained one German merchant ship and three Italian merchant ships the day before yesterday because they were loaded with a large number of cotton and cocoons from ports such as X and X downstream of the Yangtze River without a Japanese permit, resulting in their detention. The three Italian vessels were monitored at Roosevelt Wharf Nos. 1 and 2. The German merchant ship Haiyi was moved to the South Huangpu River yesterday, and the Haikang was moved from Bund Wharf No. 13 to Wharf No. 15. The flowers and cocoons carried by the ships have not been unloaded yesterday and are still being negotiated. As for the German ships Moufu, Haifu, and Feikang, the British ships Xinxingtai, Xin'anli, and Dacheng, and the American ship Dasheng, which were previously detained in the Zhoushan Islands, although the diplomatic agencies of the respective nationalities stationed in Shanghai have negotiated with the Japanese side, there is still no news of their release as of yesterday.</p>
<h3>Public Buses' Daily Revenue Nearly 70,000 After Fare Increase</h3>
<p>After the British Public Bus Company implemented the third fare increase on the 17th of this month due to increased employee subsidies and material prices, the burden on citizens has increased, and the company's business has become more developed. According to inquiries, the company's daily income was originally 50,000 yuan, but after the increase of 35% on the 17th, it can increase its daily income by 17,500 yuan, reaching a total of 67,500 yuan. Its degree of abnormal development has created the highest peak in various industries in the city. At present, the general residents of the city believe that although the price of bus materials has increased, the company usually has a lot of savings and the company's profits are very high. They hope that the price will be reduced soon to comfort the people.</p>
<h3>Shaoxing Areas Plundered by Soldiers; 3,000 Houses Destroyed; Linpu Suffers the Most Damage</h3>
<p>Since Shaoxing was once occupied by the Japanese army, although it has been recovered, it is already scarred. According to a 大通社 reporter's recent inquiry at the Shaoxing Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association, according to the association's investigation, a total of 578 houses were set on fire in the six towns within the city, including five courts belonging to administrative agencies, cultural agencies, including the county primary school, Shaoxing Middle School Affiliated Primary School, Yuezhou Book Bureau, and People's Education Hall, financial agencies, including the Continental Bank, Zhejiang Commercial Savings Bank, and the Chinese Farmers Bank. In addition, 269 houses were burned in the Keqiao District, 1,627 houses in the Linpu District, and 427 houses in the Nanchi District, totaling 2,912 houses.</p>
<p>Fellow Villagers in Shanghai Seek to Provide Relief</p>
<p>The Japanese army twice went out of Xiaoshan a few months ago, attempting to occupy Shaoxing. Residents in the surrounding urban and rural areas had previously suffered from drought, floods, plague, and rice shortages. After being harassed by the Japanese army, their lives became even more difficult. Representatives were repeatedly sent to Shanghai to appeal to the Shaoxing Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association for relief. The association immediately organized the 29 Emergency Relief Association, initiated by Pei Yunqing, Zhu Xinpei, and others, and raised 600,000 yuan, which has been fully remitted to Shaoxing for emergency relief. The 29 Emergency Relief Association ended last month and another Shaoxiao Disaster Relief Association was formed, raising more than 300,000 yuan, which has also been remitted to Shaoxing. The disaster situation in Zhuji is the most tragic. The Shaoxiao Disaster Relief Association, in order to provide relief to its hometown, has launched a one-yuan fundraising campaign to the Shanghai fellow villagers, divided into three phases, with 100,000 yuan raised in each phase. It is estimated that after 300,000 yuan has been raised, it will be remitted to Shaoxing.</p>
<h3>Bank of China Adds Chengdu Road Office</h3>

It handles deposit and withdrawal and savings businesses and is scheduled to open on December 23. Liu Danfu has been appointed as the director.</p>

<h3>Trafficking Case Continues to Recover Nine Children in Xiamen; Recovered by the Main Criminal Su Desan; Three More Children Hope Their Families Will Identify Them</h3>
<p>Xie Wanfang, the Chinese Inspector of the General Inspectorate of the Public Concession Police Department, Ji Ronggui, the Chinese Head Constable, and Zhang Decai, the investigator of the Jiaxing Road Police Station, broke up an organization specializing in trafficking children in Shanghai, Xiamen, and other places a few months ago. They arrested Su Desan, Chen Jiabai, and other seven or eight people, the leaders of the gang. It was found that Su and others had trafficked no less than several white children. In addition to the dozens of young children who have been recovered one after another, the investigators have taken the criminals to Xiamen to identify and lead the way.</p>
<p>The investigators recovered nine more young children, including: (1) Zhang Xuda, the six-year-old son of Zhang Amao at No. 2, Lane 218, Fuxu Road; (2) Jin Jiliang, the five-year-old son of Jin Xianlong at No. 183, North Henan Road; (3) Li Qingding, the five-year-old son of Li Achao at No. 15, Lane 120, Kaifeng Road; (4) Lin Miaojin, the six-year-old son of Lin Chaozhen at No. 45, Hongchenli, Wuzhou Road; (5) Ada, the six-year-old son of Shen Zhanyu at No. 169, Berle Road; (6) Zhang Shuifu, the seven-year-old son of Zhang Aneng at No. 1, Fuqingli, Fuyou Road; and</p>
<p>Three six-year-old children whose families have not yet been found, Li Zhigao, a five-year-old child Chen Chaoyuan, and a seven-year-old child Chen Zhongming. All of the above children were sold to Xiamen by Su Desan and others, and the price of each child was between three and four white yuan. If this case had not been solved, the families of the children would have had no chance to reunite with their loved ones. This kind of criminal not only separates people and families, but also includes children who are the only sons of several families, and even cuts off people's descendants. It is truly a heinous crime. Feng, the judge of the Special First Court, opened the court to hear the case yesterday morning. Ru Baoyi, the police lawyer, requested</p>
<p>Severe punishment in accordance with the law. After Judge Feng asked the families of each child, he ordered a postponement of the trial. Each child with a family was allowed to be taken back to reunite, and the rest were temporarily left at the police station to wait for identification.</p>

The owner of Han Village reported it to the police station and he was sent to the hospital, but he died before receiving treatment. The body was taken to the coroner's office. As there was no way to contact his family, a charitable organization arranged for the body to be collected and prepared for burial, awaiting identification.

<h3>Achievements of the National Medical People's Hospital</h3>
<p>Since Wen Lanting, Guan Jiong, Huang Hanzhi, Xie Qian, Ding Jimin, and others founded the Shanghai National Medical People's Hospital, they have operated with dedication and have greatly benefited the poor and sick.

As a result, even with careful budgeting, the monthly expenses still amount to over 7,000 yuan. With the recent rise in prices, it has become even more difficult to manage. While the hospital is helping the poor and sick, it is also promoting traditional Chinese medicine. These achievements are commendable.

<h3>Finance: Rumors Spread Widely; Gold Market Suddenly Experiences a Frenzied Surge; After Noon, Undisclosed Trading Causes Painful Covering of Short Positions; Transactions Reached 6,300 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market’s official session was stable, operating only for a half-day in the morning because it was Saturday afternoon. The market hovered around 6,100 yuan. Because a certain gold firm first released gold and then re-entered the market, the US dollar exchange rate weakened, falling to 6,070 yuan, before surging to 6,145 yuan. Unexpectedly, rumors of a US-Japan conflict and a possible change in the Japanese cabinet suddenly arose. Exchange houses released gold, but the resurgence was thwarted. The morning session closed down a small ten yuan. After the closing bell, a surprising and dramatic change occurred. Rumors of a possible suspension of foreign exchange supply spread. Speculators seized the opportunity to buy, and sellers were caught off guard, leading to a frenzied surge. The price rose to 6,250 yuan. Undisclosed trading outside of the official session caused painful covering of short positions, with no end in sight. Transactions even reached 6,300 yuan. By evening, the price was 6,280 yuan. Although it appeared to fall, it was secretly trading up 170 yuan. The total trading volume in the morning session was six to seven thousand taels (excluding the afternoon off-exchange trading). A jewelry store sold 30 taels of cash to a certain silver firm at a price 34 yuan lower than the forward price. There was no switch trading. Buyers posted a premium of over 30 yuan to sellers. Jewelry gold rose five yuan in the afternoon, totaling 630 yuan. Customs gold and other items remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Off-Exchange Trading Surges by 200 Yuan</p>
<p>Initially, the market was lax due to the previous day's slump, and sentiment was scattered. A silver firm released 20 taels of gold at only 6,100 yuan. Subsequently, both the gold and silver firms stalled, and a securities firm also released 300 to 400 taels, causing the price to weaken further. The silver firms conducted 20 taels of internal trading, reporting a price of 6,070 yuan. Later, due to tightening exchange rates and bullish sentiment, a certain gold firm re-entered the market heavily, causing the price to rebound strongly. Silver firms entered 30 taels to gold firms, reporting a price of 6,145 yuan. Later, as the exchange rate lengthened, exchange houses began selling, and silver firms with long positions sold off, causing a sharp decline. Securities firms released 20 taels to silver firms, re-entering within the 100 yuan range, at 6,090 yuan. By noon, the market stabilized and changes were minimal. As a result, gold firms conducted 20 taels of internal trading at 6,100 yuan, the closing price for the day, down ten yuan from the previous session. There was no official market in the afternoon due to Saturday. However, due to widespread rumors that HSBC would no longer be listed and would suspend foreign exchange supply on Monday, the off-exchange market had many buyers but few sellers. Initially, trading opened at 6,150 yuan, with money exchange firms and securities firms entering the market. The price rose to 6,250 yuan. Although it declined slightly afterward, it was rumored that transactions reached as high as 6,300 yuan. The final seller was at 6,280 yuan. The half-day saw a fluctuation of 75 yuan. The cash price for gold from the gold dealers was over ten yuan lower than the official forward price and was being purchased at 50 yuan lower.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Exchange Rate Remains Slightly Elevated</p>
<p>The exchange rate for jewelry gold at silver shops was unchanged in the morning, but at 3:30 PM in the afternoon, it was increased by five yuan. Da Tong Hang revised its rate to 630 yuan. The new rates at Xin Tong Hang were similar to the previous price. Purchases were 30 yuan lower.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Market Only Operates in the Morning, Resulting in a Dull Day</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no fluctuations in HSBC's listed rates. The undisclosed trading of British and American currencies resulted in American currency being flat and British currency being firm. Although Chinese merchants and speculators were influenced by market rumors and tended to buy, HSBC and a certain American bank supplied heavily, only temporarily tightening the market. The market soon returned to flat, and some Chinese banks came to the market to sell, which was absorbed by HSBC. However, the underlying trend was quite loose. Foreign banks traded American currency for the current month at 5.75 yuan. By the close, the market sentiment had stabilized somewhat. As a result, the British currency was 3 pence 59375, a slight loosening of 0.015625. The American currency was 5.71875 yuan, the same as the previous day's closing price.</p>
<p>Rumors Still Dominate</p>
<p>In the early morning, the London market was up 0.0625 for both near and far months, the New York silver price was flat, and the London spot gold price was stagnant. Exchange rates for British to American currency, Shanghai, etc., did not change. American to British currency was unchanged, to Shanghai fell three cents, to France there was no market. Central Bank's listed rates for various exchanges remained the same. Banks opened in the morning with spot selling prices of British currency at 3 pence 578125 and American currency at 5.78125 yuan, the same as the previous night's closing price. After opening, foreign banks were willing to sell, with Chinese banks such as the East Asia Bank and Japanese banks entering the market to buy. The price saw little change. The current month's American currency was trading at 5.71875 yuan. HSBC's listed rates were unchanged. The silver balancing tax was increased by 0.25 percent. After this, market sentiment was again stimulated by rumors, and speculators bought, softening the market. It was said that a British bank offered American currency for the current month at 5.6875 yuan. However, before long, HSBC and a certain American bank supplied the market, causing the trend to stabilize, and HSBC sold American currency for the current month to foreign banks at 5.6875 yuan. Then, seeing Chinese banks following suit, the price instead rose. HSBC and a certain American bank then re-entered the market to buy American currency for the current month at 5.71875 yuan, and foreign banks even traded American currency for the current month at 5.75 yuan. By noon, the prices for spot and current month's American currency were 5.7...875 yuan, 3 pence 59375, the next month's American 5.6875 yuan, 3 pence 578125. In the afternoon, there was no market due to Saturday. Compared to the previous day's close, American currency was unchanged for both spot and forward trading, while British currency slightly strengthened by 0....5625.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Market Sees Little Change: Hong Kong, 21st (Saturday) Dispatch: The exchange market opened flat this morning. Spot prices for British, Japanese, and Shanghai currencies were unchanged (spot price for Shanghai currency closed at 414 yuan yesterday). Spot price for American currency loosened by 0.06...5, to 23.75 yuan. At 10:30 AM, the market was flat, with no gains or losses. There was no market in the afternoon due to Saturday.</p>
<p>Tianjin Sees Contraction in British and American Currencies: Tianjin, 21st (Saturday) Dispatch: The exchange market opened flat this morning. London telegraphs tightened by 0.0046875, to 3 pence 96875. New York telegraphic transfers contracted by 0.0625, to 6.28125 yuan. Shanghai currency rose by 0.15 yuan, to 89.75 yuan. "Joint Currency" (联钞) traded at a discounted rate of 0.35 yuan in undisclosed trading, to 87.6 yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currencies Also Rise Rapidly</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw bullish rumors flourish. The official and undisclosed markets even traded up to 6,300 yuan by evening. The British and American pound surged by 3.5 yuan. The British pound still trended sluggish, with the market price remaining flat. The American dollar note even rose to 18.25 yuan, a sharp increase of 0.82 yuan from the previous day. Demand for Hong Kong notes was not scarce, and the evening price was over 4.2 yuan. The supply and demand for Japanese and Korean notes remained balanced, and the market price remained flat. The former remained at 1.58 yuan, and the latter remained at 1.32 yuan.</p>
<h3>Coal: After Several Difficulties, Wenzhou Coal Finally Arrives</h3>
<p>The price of charcoal has been increasing since the disruption of shipping from Wenzhou. Scarcity has made it more valuable. Traders, aware of the difficulty in obtaining supplies, intentionally hoarded it. Currently, inventories are depleted, and some businesses have goods, but no inventory to sell. Unexpectedly, a sailboat from Wenzhou recently arrived with 1,700 bundles of Grade A charcoal, after navigating through difficult conditions for two months. The baskets were badly damaged and the traders sold them off. Each bundle was priced at 23 yuan.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Wild Fluctuations; Yarn Market Becomes More Eventful; Double Horse Cotton Falls Over 20 Yuan in the Morning, Then Suddenly Surges 30 Yuan in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>The yarn market has become increasingly volatile. This situation is entirely due to differing perspectives between the long and short positions, resulting in conflicting sentiments and creating a pattern of rapid advances and retreats. The significant purchases by "foreign entities" certainly have their special meaning or strategy, acting quickly to enter and exit the market, which outsiders cannot discern. As for the market itself, insiders believe that actual sales cannot support the high prices. Lower-quality yarn prices are low, and most traders are abandoning them and even considering taking short positions. Small silver firms in the market are adept at speculation, buying when prices rise and selling when they fall. Therefore, any change creates a sense of panic. Based on this situation, unexpected developments may occur in the future. Today, 1,455 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The morning opening for Double Horse cotton was due to short selling in the afternoon. The prevailing opinion was bearish, with plans to buy after prices fell. Therefore, there were more sellers than buyers, weakening the market. The price was 1,345 yuan. Shortly after, it fell to 1,341 yuan. The long positions came out to compete, and news of a softening exchange rate gradually pushed the price up to 1,349 yuan. As prices rose, claims of no spot transactions emerged, and the short positions became active, slightly depressing the market. Unexpectedly, the "scalpers" on the trading floor, always eager to profit from market movements, took advantage of the opportunity to exert downward pressure and sell off, causing panic and a flood of selling orders. The market plummeted to 1,322 yuan, and buyers hesitated to participate. Suddenly, foreign traders arrived and bought several bales, causing the market to rebound sharply to 1,335 yuan. The momentum shifted from weak to strong, with few changes in position. The daily turnover was approximately 6,800 bales. The Double Horse 20s yarn price was about 20 yuan lower than the previous day.</p>
<p>Yarn Prices Soared 30 Yuan in the Afternoon: Yarn brokers at the Shanghai Yarn Exchange were scrambling to buy Double Horse cotton, spreading rumors that the off-exchange gold market had surged. As a result, buyers rushed in, pushing the Double Horse 20s yarn price up 20 yuan to 1,340 yuan, then to 1,355 yuan. At the Securities Exchange, the price was 1,358 yuan, and it finally reached 1,364.5 yuan. Finding the goods became like searching for treasure. The dramatic shift from the morning's coldness to such heat demonstrates the rapid changes in speculative sentiment.</p>
<h3>Tianjin Cotton Sales Gradually Increase</h3>
<p>The spot cotton market remains quiet, with no major developments from the mills. However, as the yarn market continues to advance, the interconnected cotton market will inevitably be affected. Currently, the market remains stable.</p>
<p>Another report states that the price of foreign cotton on the New York cotton market initially rose due to buying pressure, but later fell due to selling from spot traders and profit-taking from some long positions. The closing price was down 1-2 pounds from the previous day. News from the Indian market has been delayed due to cable disruptions.</p>
<p>The Shanghai foreign cotton market has remained exceptionally quiet. The reasons for the mills' lack of interest are unknown, but purchasing of raw cotton for Tianjin has gradually increased, making the outlook for the cotton market optimistic.</p>
<h3>Food: Imported Rice on the Undisclosed Market Remains Firm Due to Optimism; Nearly 10,000 Bags of Rice Arrive Yesterday</h3>
<p>The imported rice market continued to rise amid confusion yesterday. The widespread rumors excited sellers. Prices of lower-grade imported rice in each market again took the opportunity to reach their peak. In terms of quality, the market price rose by 0.5 to 1 yuan. The increased prices reduced buyers appetite. Additionally, the arrival of new goods from Japanese firms dampened the market, and the afternoon closed down a small 0.3-0.4 yuan. However, prices of higher-grade rice in each market remained stubbornly high. Prices for mixed and forward rice similarly pulled up by several corners to over a yuan. The December Saigon No. 2 rice with the Heyi mark opened at 94.1 yuan, and the January Hezhong mark opened at 88.5 yuan to 88 yuan. The December 9th small bag opened at 90...5 yuan to 92.8 yuan. The bulk packaging rice opened between 89 yuan and 90 yuan, The January Heyi mark opened at 83.5 yuan, and the February Jianyuan mark opened at 84 yuan, totaling between six and seven hundred tons. Six to seven thousand bags were traded spot. There are reports of multiple contacts with Japanese firms for new trades, with one contract for 1,000 tons of small bag rice from January for 80..5 yuan reportedly concluded. Mixed brand No. 1 Saigon opened at 87 yuan and 86.5 yuan, No. 2 was not opened, and Siamese also opened with only No. 1 at 86.3 yuan. Zhongguan fire milled opened at 86 yuan. second-grade opened at 84 yuan. Xin Feng was the only small bag to open on schedule with 1,300 to 1,400 bags at 79 yuan. Crushed tip opened at 75.5 yuan, Tokyo milled tip opened at 80.07 yuan, Red rough opened at 71.5 yuan and 71 yuan, Wuhu tip opened at 79.7 yuan.</p>
<p>Domestic rice such as thick and thin Japonica rice continues to arrive in limited quantities. Sales in this market have been strong due to the difficulty in purchasing imported rice. The price of domestic rice, propped up by sellers, continues to increase. Opening prices for Kunshan saw white Japonica rice at 99 yuan and 97 yuan, a special rice at 102 yuan, Qingjiao thin rice at 89.5 yuan to 89 yuan.</p>
<p>Although the supply of glutinous rice remains insufficient, the market has a plentiful supply and demand is normal, therefore it is difficult for prices to compete with other products. Prices remain flat. bleached ranged 95-96 yuan, fragrant and white rice ranged 84-81 yuan.</p>
<p>Imported rice continues to arrive in Shanghai. The Yihuo Shipping Company's Mingsheng ship transported imported rice from Hong Kong. The ship arrived yesterday at 4pm, docking at Roosevelt Wharf. The load totaled nine thousand four hundred and seventy-one bags. unloading will commence today.</p>
<h3>Vermicelli is held and not released</h3>
<p>The price of vermicelli remains stable. Although a large amount of vermicelli has arrived since this firm promoted its sales, it is difficult to make new agreements, which is further complicated by reports that domestic factories are reducing production. As a result, prices have stopped falling. A large batch of Australian vermicelli is currently being unloaded. The total is estimated to be 350,000 bags. Most of the holders are tightly controlling prices and are unwilling to sell. A portion has been allocated to client assistance for re-export, therefore the price remains supported. Yesterday, the quoted prices for Fortress Brand and Beautiful Brand was 21.5 yuan, Clock Tower brand was 21.3 yuan. Sales through timber companies increased slightly by 4-5,000 bags. Because it is the end of the week, and foreign exchange has lengthened, new hoarding has lessened. Market dynamics have entered a state of fluctuation.</p>
<p>Small trades lack progression, because quantity has become more rare. a smaller portion of goods has been allocated to be sold with factories. The quoted price has been steady at thirty-two yuan. Domestic Factories have wanted to buy forward goods, but have found few new trades. market dynamics have entered a stable hold.</p>
<h3>Seafood: Pepper Rises Repeatedly</h3>
<p>Because pepper supply is reduced and existing inventory is thinning, but outgoing volume is increasing, prices have repeatedly risen. Now the market price is 220 yuan for white pepper, Black big pepper is 112 yuan. Number 1 pepper is 115 yuan, an increase of over 10 yuan. Continued firm prices are expected.</p>
<h3>A Small Issue Regarding the Time for Clearing Checks - A Few Opinions on Returned Checks from the Bund - Ji Runmo</h3>
<p>According to custom, if a depositor deposits an on-sight check into a bank, it is necessary to wait until the day of settlement before it can be determined whether it can be cleared, because after the bank receives the check deposited by the depositor, it must first hand it over to the clearing house for separate accounting, and then the clearing house will carry out procedures separately within its jurisdiction. If it belongs to the same bank, it will be added to the clearing at 3:15 p.m. on the same day; if it belongs to the outer Bund (i.e., foreign banks) or other banks (i.e., silver firms, money shops, and non-clearing banks), it will be delivered separately. After the returned checks from each bank are collected the next day, they will be returned to the original bank that received the check, and the ability to clear the deposited check will be determined based on whether or not the check is returned.</p>
<p>Currently, under normal circumstances, all checks deposited by depositors with the same bank before 3:00 p.m. can be added to the clearing on the same day. After the returned checks are exchanged after 11:00 a.m. the next day, if there is no return of a check, then it can be cleared. For checks belonging to other banks, the process is even faster than with the same bank. Usually, it can be determined whether it can be cleared after 10:00 a.m. the next day, but the time for receiving the check is much earlier than with the same bank. Usually, the books for the next day must be closed after 11:00 a.m. For checks belonging to the outer Bund, the time for receiving the check is the same as with the same bank, but the time for returning the check the next day is uncertain. Sometimes it comes around 12:00 p.m., sometimes around 10:00 a.m., and sometimes close to 2:00 p.m. As for whether there are any more returns after 2:00 p.m., it cannot be said for sure because there is no set time. In practice, banks always use 2:00 p.m. as the standard. If 2:00 p.m. arrives and there is no returned check, then the customer can freely clear the check, which can generally be said to be an appropriate arrangement. However, precisely because the return time of checks from the outer Bund banks is not fixed, there is some risk, which is quite inconvenient for both the bank itself and the customer. Therefore, I believe that in the future, the agency responsible for receiving and delivering returned checks from the outer Bund banks should find a standard time to reduce the trouble on all sides and, further, to avoid any possible malpractices. This is one point. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Securities - Many Domestic Bonds Are Emerging</h3>
<p>The gray market for public bonds saw slight changes yesterday. Trading was flat in the morning, but rumors suddenly arose in the afternoon, claiming that foreign exchange would not be supplied or would be reduced starting next week, ostensibly to resist something. The price of gold secretly surged by 150 to 160 yuan, and U.S. dollar notes rose to 18 yuan. People were restless, and rumors were rampant, mostly groping in the dark. Yesterday's sellers included Dingkang &amp; Co., which was acting on behalf of a certain bank, indicating that there was a reason for the sales. In the morning, only Dingkang sold, while Yitai and Tongkang bought slightly. Market prices were slightly weak. In the afternoon, Dingkang continued to sell, and Shuntai and Yichang also sold heavily. Shengtda, Hengfu, and Lianyi, who had been bullish, all emerged. Tongkang covered their short positions, while Shunchang, Yitai, Shenchang, and Yizhong bought slightly. Market prices continued to decline, eventually falling by a uniform 1 to 5 jiao. Total transaction volume was 2.2 million yuan. A simplified table is provided below.</p>
<p>Stock trading: 500 shares of Hanyeping Company were traded at a price of 3 yuan per share.</p>
<h3>Nine - Oil Cakes - The Oil Market Is Stirring - Prices Surge by 3 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the oil market was flat in the morning with sluggish trading. In the afternoon, rumors of positive news from the financial market caused panic, and speculators took the opportunity to act. Whether it was raw soybean oil, everything was active, resulting in a sharp increase of 3 yuan. Yesterday, a total of 300 pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil were traded; the price is detailed in the market price column. 50 pieces of Yantai raw oil and over 1,000 cans of canned oil were traded. Additionally, 100 barrels of Qingdao raw oil, 100 pieces of Jiaozhou soybean oil, 100 pieces of Yantai soybean oil, 20 barrels of Qingdao soybean oil, 450 pieces of Dasu soybean oil, and 600 dan of Dayou Factory soybean oil were traded.</p>
<p>On the 22nd, 4,500 bags of soybeans and 150 bags of sesame were offered for sale, all to be shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods - Cotton Cloth Stimulates - Hoarders Are Widely Scouring</h3>
<p>The factory cloth market was flat and weak in the morning but suddenly rose in the afternoon, resulting in prices higher than the previous day. This was because of widespread rumors that Chongqing's foreign exchange rate would be listed and that reductions would be implemented, stimulating sentiment. People widely scoured for goods in the market, and factories also took the opportunity to raise prices, resulting in a sudden increase in transactions. The selling was brisk. Fine cloth was sold at a minimum price of 36.50 yuan in the morning but was raised to 37.50 yuan in the afternoon, with little supply. All brands of fine cloth and twill cloth rose by 2.5 to 7.5 jiao per bolt. Coarse cloth rose by 2.5 to 5 jiao per bolt. Bleached and dyed cloth also increased by about 5 jiao per bolt. Over 2,000 pieces of various goods were traded on the street. Over 300 pieces of fine cloth and bleached and dyed cloth were handled by the Ningbo and Wenzhou merchants from Eastern Zhejiang. Over 200 pieces of twill cloth, bleached and dyed cloth, and foulard were handled by the Guangdong and Hong Kong merchants. Over 100 pieces of coarse cloth and blue cloth were handled by the Yantai merchants from the North. On the 22nd, 10 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Yantai and 1,895 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The morning market for Dongbu cloth was stable. The closing price for Longtou fine cloth was 39 yuan and 1 jiao in the morning. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday, but the gray market trading among outside colleagues saw a sharp increase. Longtou fine cloth was traded at 40 yuan, and fine cloth was traded at 36 yuan, an increase of 5 to 7.5 jiao per bolt compared to the previous day.</p>
<h3>Demand for Western Suit Wool Is Sluggish</h3>
<p>Yesterday was Saturday. The wool market was said to be not bad. Demand for light-colored, thin goods for spring and summer from inside and outside the industry was still strong. Both shops and factories continued to offer large quantities. Transactions for dark black, cold-weather goods were mostly sporadic, as the end of the lunar year was approaching, and both buyers and sellers adhered to the principle of selling and buying as needed. The market for Western suit wool has gradually become sluggish recently, as shops and stores are all trying to sell off their existing inventory to prepare for closing, so the trend is mediocre, unlike overcoat wool, which is more popular. Overcoat wool business is slow because customers mostly dislike the high prices and adopt a "get by" attitude. However, those who are truly cold and those whose clothes are worn out will temporarily make new ones, resulting in the actual sales period being longer than in previous years.</p>

<h3>Sugar Market - Sugar Prices Surge Wildly in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was initially flat but then tightened. A certain rumor suddenly emerged in the afternoon, causing the upward trend to become even stronger. The Guild's listed prices for current goods were as follows: First-grade crude white sugar from foreign warehouses was initially 76 yuan but eventually rose to 77 to 77.5 yuan, an increase of 1.5 yuan. Dutch cotton BS mark was 74.8 yuan, an increase of 1 yuan. Dutch red sugar was initially soft in the morning at 60.6 to 61 yuan but rose to 62 to 62.5 yuan in the afternoon, an increase of 1.3 yuan. Taikoo car white B mark was 75.5 to 75.3 yuan in the morning but rose to 77 yuan in the afternoon, an increase of 1.2 yuan. DY mark was 72.3 yuan in the morning but rose to 74 yuan in the afternoon, an increase of 1.8 yuan. HX mark in West Warehouse was 72.2 yuan in the morning and 71.7 yuan for old stock. In the afternoon, West Warehouse goods were 74 yuan, an increase of 1.9 yuan.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods - Vermicelli Soars - Jinan Peach Kernels Also Rise by 20 Yuan</h3>
<p>Vermicelli prices rose sharply because the commission charged by the local market was unfavorable, so 500 packages of goods were directly shipped to Hong Kong for sale, while only 300 packages were offered in Shanghai, resulting in a sudden increase of more than 20 yuan. Longkou vermicelli opened at 180 yuan, and Qingdao vermicelli opened at 160 yuan, both recent highs.</p>
<p>Peach Kernels - Arrivals of Jinan peach kernels have been scarce recently, so the market is still tight, and prices have risen again. Recently, new goods have been offered at a price of 200 yuan, an increase of 20 yuan. However, walnuts remain weak, such as Qingzhou walnuts, which are only 57 yuan.</p>
<h3>Medicinal Materials - Pangolin Scales Are Scarce - Prices Rise Again - 20 to 30 Yuan</h3>
<p>Pangolin scales have been scarce recently. Market inventories are very low, so the trend is increasingly tight and gradually upward. Yesterday, pangolin scales reached 480 yuan, and pangolin skins also required 280 yuan. The increase in prices has been 20 to 30 yuan, and there is currently little hope of relief.</p>

<h3>Sino-American Charity Basketball Game - U.S. Retains Shen Bao Cup - U.S. Team Wins Again Last Night</h3>
<p>The fourth annual Shen Bao Cup Sino-American Charity Basketball Tournament concluded last night with great success. The Shen Bao Cup will be retained by the U.S. team for another year. The Chinese team will have to wait until next year to compete for the championship. The U.S. team also won the third game last night with a score of 53 to 42. The Chinese team led in the first half with a score of 27 to 23. However, the U.S. team gradually surpassed them in the second half. The Chinese team initially fielded Wang Nanqun, Bao Songyuan, Liang Yunming, Ren Xiangcheng, and Chen Bangzhen. The three forwards, Liang, Wang, and Bao, were very successful in their attacks and took the lead. Unfortunately, luck was not on their side in the second half, and the U.S. team became increasingly aggressive, scoring eight consecutive points to make the score 27 to 31. The Chinese team brought on Zhen Zhongxiang, Long Xuechong, Nan Zhenhui, and Pei to try to save the game, but they were unable to reverse the defeat. The final score was 53 to 42. It is estimated that the ticket sales for this deciding game amounted to 3,000 to 4,000 yuan, which will be settled and announced within a few days. The proceeds will be divided equally into three parts and donated to the Shanghai Refugee Association, the Shanghai International Red Cross, and the West Qing Christmas Children's Party.

<p>Children's Weekly</p>
<h3>Opening Day</h3>
<p>— Editor</p>
<p>Confucius is our most sage and teacher, and also one of the greatest and most famous figures in our country's history. Whether men or women, old or young, literate or illiterate, when they speak of Confucius the Sage, almost everyone knows of him. Children who have gone to school, of course, know Confucius and respect him as well.</p>
<p>Confucius's personality, knowledge, thought, and morality all surpassed everything else; he was truly great. Children who have not read much may not fully understand and some may even regard him as a kind of illusory deity or Buddha. But in reality, he was indeed a man, just an extraordinary one.</p>
<p>Children are born thousands of years too late to see Confucius. Even if they read his books, apart from receiving his many teachings, they always feel a vague understanding of the events of his life. Now, things are better. You can now see this great Confucius appear before your very eyes, vividly portraying the events of his life, as if taking you back thousands of years. What is this? It is none other than the new grand film "Confucius" produced by the Min Hua Film Company.</p>
<p>Because we respect Confucius, we also attach special importance to this "Confucius" film and are publishing this special "Confucius" page for it. After school, children may as well go with their parents to the Jin Cheng Grand Theater to see it. In this film, you can see Confucius's way of being a person and understand why Confucius is so respected. This is truly the most beneficial kind of entertainment and can also be said to be the most meaningful kind of self-study outside of school lessons.</p>
<h3>Confucius</h3>
<p>— Kang Yan</p>
<p>Have you already read the lesson on "Confucius" in your history textbooks? I think there is also a special day that you may remember more clearly, which is the public holiday of Confucius's birthday, because on that day, you can have a holiday and rest, and have a great time playing. When I was in elementary school, I remembered this day particularly clearly.</p>
<p>Why do we have a holiday to commemorate Confucius's birthday? Of course, it is because later generations admire his noble personality and the spirit of his unyielding and arduous struggle throughout his life.</p>
<p>Confucius, he was born in a time when treacherous officials and rebellious sons ran rampant. His great and immortal principles of "rectifying the heart, making the will sincere, cultivating the self, regulating the family, governing the state and pacifying the world, loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, and love" were difficult for those warmongering and mad fellows to accept. He traveled around the states for fourteen years, and finally had to return to his hometown, where, based on the history of Lu, he wrote a "Spring and Autumn Annals," recording the indolent state of affairs at that time one by one.</p>
<p>Although Confucius passed away two thousand years ago, his spirit, the events of his life, and all the historical sites related to him have been preserved to this day. The tomb of the Sage Confucius is now in Qufu, Shandong, fifteen feet high and fifty paces in circumference. Children, when you have the opportunity to go there in the future, you can go and take a look.</p>
<p>Children! Do you feel admiration for a person like Confucius? Then you should recognize his teachings and learn from them, embrace his spirit, and move forward. If you can learn even a little bit, even if you cannot become a great sage, you may be able to become a small sage!</p>
<h3>Confucius Traveling Around the States</h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>Children: Are you all familiar with the name Confucius? You only know that he is a great sage of our country, considering him to be Master Kong or Mr. Kong, and do not know that he was a statesman. Unfortunately, in the Spring and Autumn period, the rulers were all foolish and incompetent and could not listen to Confucius's great principles. Therefore, when Confucius was fifty-six years old, he and his disciples Zilu, Zigong, Yan Hui, and more than ten others began their journey, running around the world. They worked hard outside for fourteen years, but in the end, they could not be employed by any state. The most dangerous place they encountered on the road was between Chen and Cai. At that time, Confucius was preparing to take his disciples to Chu, but Chen and Cai were afraid that Confucius's arrival in Chu would be detrimental to them, so they sent troops to block their way halfway, trapping Confucius and his party in the wilderness for a total of seven days and seven nights. The food that Confucius brought was all eaten, and they could not even get water to drink. If they did not break out, they would have to starve to death in the wilderness. At that time, Zilu was extremely angry and could not bear it anymore. He suddenly held an ax and shield, shouted loudly, and charged out. Zigong grabbed him and said, "There are so many soldiers from Chen and Cai surrounding us. How can you break out by yourself? It is better to wait for the rescue troops from Chu!" Zilu was still struggling to break a bloody path when he suddenly heard Confucius playing the qin inside the house. His courage gradually subsided with the sound of the qin, and he unconsciously put down the ax and shield in his hands. They finally managed to survive for seven days, and the rescue troops sent by Chu arrived, and Confucius and his disciples escaped danger.</p>
<h3>I Want to Learn From Zilu</h3>
<p>— Liu Jiaquan</p>
<p>These past few days, the Jin Cheng Grand Theater has been showing the film "Confucius." Last night, my dad took me to see it.</p>
<p>This is truly a good film. In this film, I saw the war scenes with ancient chariots, bows and arrows, and swords; I saw the clothes, utensils, and living habits of ancient people; I saw and heard the voices and smiles of ancient sages; and I also saw the chaos of that time—the Spring and Autumn Period—the great powers invading the small powers, the ministers killing the rulers, and the sons killing the fathers. It gave me a lot of knowledge, more than what I got from attending several history classes, and it was even more interesting. Confucius is naturally great. In particular, his courage at the Jia Valley Meeting, which made the powerful Qi submit, is truly worthy of our admiration.</p>
<p>And among Confucius's many disciples, I admire Zilu the most. Because Zilu, in addition to learning a lot of knowledge from Confucius, was the only one who accepted Confucius's courage to not be afraid of the powerful and violent. He scolded the treacherous officials and rebellious sons, and fought against the Chen and Cai armies that surrounded them. At the same time, he also advised Confucius when Confucius unknowingly made mistakes. And in the end, Zilu finally completely obeyed Confucius's teachings, in order to defend the state of Wei, resist the Jin soldiers, and fight against the rebellious minister Yang Huo, and finally died in battle on the battlefield.</p>
<p>I love Zilu! I want to learn from Zilu!</p>
<p>Mr. Tang Huaiqiu playing Confucius in the "Confucius" film.</p>
<h3>To Young Readers</h3>
<p>— Mincheng</p>
<p>Dear children: In three days, it will be Christmas, and when you commemorate this Western saint, please do not forget our Eastern sage—Confucius.</p>
<p>Although Confucius was a figure more than two thousand years ago, his teachings are still deeply rooted in the human world today, and his personality is still so worthy of respect by later generations.</p>
<p>Confucius's greatest advocacy was for people to "rectify the heart and make the will sincere, cultivate the self and regulate the family, govern the state and pacify the world," meaning to teach people to start by improving themselves and enriching themselves, and then gradually regulate the family, govern the state, and pacify the world. Although his life was mainly devoted to teaching, he was by no means a mere talker. He was able to set an example and teach his disciples, and he was able to tirelessly enlighten many rulers of the time. He held a firm resolve and traveled around the states, hoping to speak of the way of the sages to the people of the world. His spirit of sacrificing himself for the sake of the Dao is the main reason why he is forever respected.</p>
<p>In the past, we overly regarded Confucius as a deified idol, which is wrong. Now we should thoroughly understand him: he is a person just like us, and the events of his life are the best model for us to establish ourselves and conduct ourselves.</p>
<p>Now, things are better. The Min Hua Film Company has turned Confucius into a film. An ancient figure who was not easily understood by you children in books can now appear before your eyes like an ordinary person. I think you should take advantage of the Christmas and New Year holidays to ask your parents, elder brothers, and elder sisters to take you to the Jin Cheng Grand Theater to get to know this Eastern sage! I believe you will be able to gain the greatest benefit in two hours. I wish you happiness!</p>
<h3>Two Stories About Confucius</h3>
<p>— Pan Shi</p>
<p>1. Teaching at the Apricot Altar</p>
<p>In the past, Confucius also taught many students, but his way of teaching was somewhat different from how we attend lecture halls now. He often saw something happening or something and would explain the principles in it to the students at any time, so that the students would know how to be an upright and useful good person. Sometimes he would also formally teach, teaching students to read poetry and write essays, learn etiquette, and learn music. In addition, they also had to learn archery and chariot driving. Like our physical education class, they trained their bodies well, so that they had both literary and martial skills, so that they could contribute to the country and do things for everyone in the future. He also taught students to be polite, to have a good conscience, to be righteous, not to do bad things, not to be greedy, and to know shame. The place where they had classes was called "Apricot Altar," perhaps because there were many apricot trees around.</p>
<p>2. Speaking of Aspirations on Mount Nong</p>
<p>Once, Confucius and several of his good students went to travel in the mountains. When they reached the high mountains, Confucius asked the students what their aspirations were for the future. Zilu was very brave, so he replied: "I am willing to go to the battlefield to fight against the enemy." Zigong was very eloquent, so he said: "If two countries start a war, he is willing to impartially judge who is right and who is wrong?" Yan Hui was benevolent, he said: "I am willing to make everyone in the world have clothes to wear, have food to eat, understand the principles, and live happily, loving each other like brothers and sisters." Confucius saw that the students were very ambitious, so he happily praised them and encouraged them.</p>

<h3>The Sunlight of Dawn (II)</h3>
<p>— Light</p>
<p>Last time in this newspaper, we said that Jesus is the "Sunlight of Dawn." Why do we say that?</p>
<p>(1) He is the beginning of the Gospel: Jesus's Gospel, unlike Judaism, does not have regional and ethnic restrictions, but meets the needs of all mankind. Regardless of whether people are civilized or uncivilized, and regardless of whether the land is cold or hot, everyone can benefit from hearing the Gospel, live a noble life by knowing God, and extend love to others by knowing God's love. Sunlight shines on the earth, and Jesus's Gospel is similarly available to all.</p>
<p>(2) He is the beginning of the union of human and divine life: The boundary between God and man has always been as wide as a chasm. Since Jesus was born, the world has had a new life of "human-divine union." Saint Paul said: "God made us friends with himself through Jesus..." He also said: "We beg you on behalf of Jesus to reconcile with God" (2 Corinthians 5:18/20) Jesus himself also said: "I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one can come to the Father except through me (John 14:6)</p>
<p>(3) He is a ray of dawn in the shadow of death: Christmas is an opportunity for relatives and friends to gather together. Have any new friends left us this year? Last year, he shared joy with you during Christmas, and won't you feel sad without him this year! But why bother? This sunlight of dawn has already shone! This light not only illuminates us who live in the world, but also shines into the valley of the shadow of death. Didn't Jesus also enter that dark tomb, resurrect on the third day, break the darkness, and give us all the hope of resurrection? If you cannot be comforted by this ray of dawn, then there is nothing else in the world that can comfort you! How can your sadness and your tears be stopped? Today, you must believe without doubt that the "Sunlight of Dawn" has already shone. May you accept this light and no longer grope in the darkness, indulging in meaningless sorrow, "for this light is the true light, which gives light to everyone who comes into the world" (John 1:9). Since it says "everyone who comes into the world," of course, you are included, and Heavenly Father has not abandoned you. (To be continued on the twenty-fifth)</p>

<h3>New Trends in the Theater World at the End of the Year</h3>
<p>— Sick Dove</p>
<p>Every year at the end of the year, Peking opera theaters must adjust roles and recruit new talent to prepare for the competition in the New Year. This year, the lineups of each theater are very neat, and the roles are also rarely adjusted. However, in order to strengthen their lineups, each troupe is now hiring new actors separately. A summary of what I have heard is presented to the public.</p>
<p>Golden Hall: Lian Chengye Shengzhang Shenghou recruited Wu Sheng Shang Heyu, Xiao Sheng Cheng Jixian, and Xu Sheng Shi Huibao, etc. The talent for Dan roles has not yet been decided. Shang Cheng and Shi are all veteran performers and are also the last surviving typical figures in today's theater world. Shang's "Tie Long Mountain," "Siping Mountain," "Shenting Ridge," "Yan Yang Tower," and other plays have exquisite skills and are refined and calm. Although he is old, his heroic posture is still impressive and his majesty remains the same. Every move is worth learning from. Although Ji Xian's voice has deteriorated, his steady movements and clear enunciation still exist as a model and can be used as a reference for future generations. Zhi Nong came to the south last year. His grand and majestic singing style and elegant and unrestrained are being negotiated. Ying Guang She of Song Dezhu and the opera school class led by Song Yuru have not yet been decided.</p>
<p>Renewal: Renewal took over from Li Wanchun. The team included Yan Huizhu, Sun Yukun, Jiang Miaoxiang, Liu Lianrong, etc. Before the new actors arrived in Shanghai, Shen Manhua, Zhang Yunlou, and the troupe's Wang Hongfu, etc., temporarily performed for a short period as a transition. Yan Huizhu came to the south with her father last year and made guest appearances in plays such as "Entering the Palace Twice," and also owned the "San Niang Teaches Her Son" Peking opera film. Her beautiful appearance and moving demeanor have been hard-working in recent years, and her art should have improved greatly. Sun Yukun has not been to Shanghai for a long time, and is worthy of attention. Sun Ling's body is strong and his martial arts are superb. Plays such as "Picking Hua Che" and "Changban Slope" directly enter the Yang family's room. When Xiaolou was alive, he loved this child the most. His artistic sophistication can be imagined. Miaoxiang Lianrong has come to the south frequently over the years and is known to the people of Shanghai, so I will not go into details.</p>
<p>Carlton: The roles of Yifeng Society have always been known for their balance. After the reorganization this autumn, the lineup is slightly weakened, especially the Xiao Sheng, Xiao Chou, and Wu Lian. It is heard that Ge Cijiang has been invited to rejoin. Xiao Sheng and Hua Lian are still in the making. During the Lunar New Year, the old ones will still be performed for ten days, and "The Six Articles of Wen Suchen" will be staged during the year.</p>
<p>Great Stage: Since the Great Stage performed "The Legend of the Supernatural Sword Master," the business has been booming. The main roles such as Lin Shusen, Xue Youqin, and Zhang Shuxian are still in continuous service. New roles were hired: Wu Sheng Zhang Delu and Shen Xiaoting will join on the Lunar New Year's Day. Zhang Ling is a southern Wu Sheng predecessor with a very wide stomach. Shen Ling has performed in Jinan and other places. And he has a reputation.</p>
<p>Common Stage: Zhao Ruquan will continue to lead the performance on the Public Stage at the beginning of the year. Recently, Chen Yuelou went north to invite roles and invited Liu Hanchen, Yang Weina, and Zhang Ruting. Hanchen was a popular actor in Shanghai and was known for his explosive performances. The play "Golden Money Leopard" once enjoyed a great reputation. Recently, due to his age, he switched to acting in laborious Wu Sheng plays. Kun Dan Yang Weina, formerly a social flower in Peiping, has only recently entered the sea and is known in the north. Her appearance is as gorgeous as Wu Suqiu, and her acting skills are also exquisite and remarkable and should be sensational for a while. Zhang Ruting has been away from the people of Shanghai for a long time. When he was on the Samsung Stage in a certain year, he was in the same class as Zhao Ruquan and was not very successful.

<p>5. Beautiful Shadows on Mandarin Duck Lake</p>
<p>Mu Zhai once wrote a hundred-rhyme poem of "Beautiful Girl from the South" for her, which can be said to have exhausted Chang Ji's efforts, and won the beauty's favor. If she was willing to marry Mu Zhai, it was partly because she admired Mu Zhai's talent and reputation, and partly to contend with Chen Wuzi, as she would only marry a man of renown. Mu Zhai's talent and fame were only above Chen's, not below, which would show Chen Wuzi. So she once said to her sister Jiang Zi: "The high-nosed lord, even if he is not unique in ancient and modern times, is also a subversive hero of an era. How can the rest of you mediocre people hope to reach his heights?" So she did not dislike Mu Zhai's old age. Aunt Xu originally welcomed Chancellor Qian and strongly encouraged them to be together. Mu Zhai did not spare his wealth, measuring pearls to propose, and only then was he able to fulfill his wish. On this day, they performed the wedding ceremony on a boat in Mandarin Duck Lake. Many famous officials, talented men, and beautiful women, who were free, all came to congratulate. The weather was clear, and the painted boats on Mandarin Duck Lake were like clouds. The flutes and drums were noisy, the guests were numerous, and the Qi Laohe was in harmony. The etiquette was complete, and it can be said to be very grand. The rhyme was spread between Mandarin Duck Lake and Yushan. At this time, Mu Zhai was already sixty years old, with all his beard and hair white, while Liu Rushi was in full bloom, with condensed fat and graceful body. At that time, there was a rhyme of "a pear blossom tree pressing begonias." Qian Mu Zhai married Rushi, and returned to Yushan together. The neighbors even had frivolous children, who threw stones in front of their painted boat as they passed. Mu Zhai ignored it and returned to the mountain villa, where he wrote four chapters of a reunion poem as a memorial for the future. He then called Liu Rushi the Lady of Hedong, and the family all called her Madam Liu, treating Liu Rushi with great respect, unlike ordinary small stars. Mu Zhai also built a five-room pearl building at the foot of Beishan, named "Jiang Yun," taking the meaning of the descent of the celestial maiden from the true Gao Jiang, comparing Liu Rushi to a celestial being in the sky, with thousands of volumes of books. The two met morning and evening, proofreading many rare books and ancient editions. Often, when Qian Mu Zhai wanted to search for a certain volume for textual research, Liu Rushi could randomly draw a certain book and volume from tens of thousands of books, without fail, showing Liu Rushi's strong memory. Famous scholars from all over the world came one after another, and there were many guests in Jiang Yun Tower. Sometimes Mu Zhai was too lazy to come out to see them, so Liu Rushi came out to entertain them on his behalf, sometimes wearing a mink crown and leather boots, sometimes wearing feathered clothes, and she was elegant and unrestrained, which was rare even among men, let alone women? Moreover, she had read tens of thousands of volumes, and had a thorough knowledge of ancient and modern times, so when she answered guests, she was eloquent and had endless responses, and the guests were all captivated by her. Historical stories have been passed down a lot. When the people of Yushan mentioned the three words Lady of Hedong, everyone praised her, and everyone knew that she was an extraordinary woman.</p>

<h3>After Reading "Business Economics"</h3>
<p>— Shi Min</p>
<p>Xu Xisheng, a stage designer, had planned to write a script for several months on the theme of nouveau riche in the special environment of the isolated island. The original title of the play was "Conscience Trade", but he felt that such a scope was too broad, and in the minds of upright gentlemen like us, it was a bit difficult to measure the activities of these bad-conscience people, so although he once started writing, it is said that it soon stopped invisibly.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was because he suffered too much from the oppression of these bad-conscience people, and with the urging of his friends, he resolutely picked up his pen again and decided to target the rice weevils who were suffering from the pain of new experiences, accompanied by the blind love-supremacy ideas of isolated island men and women. So, a month ago, a work criticizing the times was completed.</p>
<p>In "Business Economics", we not only know the selfishness, conspiracy, and viciousness of these bad-conscience people, but we also see the omen of the demise of these people. Although we do not believe in cause and effect, we hope that the traces of these bastards may be what the people of the isolated island are looking forward to! Therefore, although there is no bright and positive indication here, the reverse side of the shadow may be more able to reveal the right path!</p>
