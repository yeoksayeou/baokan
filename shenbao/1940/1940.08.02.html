<h3>美政府禁止　飛機油輸往各國　西半球各國不在禁止輸出之列　日受影響最大認美此舉為反日</h3>
<p>華盛頓　美政府頃已禁止飛機油輸往各國、惟西半球各國除外、而在西半球以外之美人航空公司、亦仍許獲有飛機油、羅斯福總統秘書歐萊向新聞記者聲稱、輸出統制專員梅克斯威爾贊成此舉、總統乃予以核准、至於美國是否仍以汽油運往英國則渠未知之云、美當局旣准美人公司獲有汽油自將與泛美航空公司等經營對葡萄牙及對太平洋綫航空業務者合作、（一日路透社電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　美政府飛機油輸出之禁令、雖適用於西半球外各國、然日本最受影響、因歐洲軸心國爲英國封鎖、早已不能輸入美油矣、美國此舉、是否與在華美人繼續受日本壓迫與威脅有關、固無人知之、但海令適於此時發表、殊使人注意耳、英國供不受影響、因加拿大仍可採購、而可將其現存飛機油轉運英國也、同時英國並可從中美之委內瑞拉等處獲取新供給、（一日路透社電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　某一政府當局、昨日向合衆社記者聲稱、中、日兩國均深賴美國供給飛機汽油、但中國所受羅斯福總統禁運命令之影響、較日本所受者爲輕、英國封鎖緬甸公路後、中國之主要接濟路綫被阻雖然日本仰賴飛機汽油於美國之外、尚有荷屬東印度羣島及委內瑞拉、但後二者僅能供給日本少許汽油、或謂日本或將利用較美國及歐洲各國所用者爲次之飛機汽油、因日本飛機所遭遇中國飛機之競爭、並不十分嚴重也、美國陸軍部曾堅持需用八十七至一百辛烷之汽油、日本飛機或將用七十至七五辛烷之汽油、據美國商務部所發統計、六月份日本曾獲得飛機油五·〇四八桶、今年首六個月、非美洲各國向美國購買飛機汽油、總計一·二一三·六六二桶、而日本所購者、一〇五·六六二桶、六月份、日本佔購美國飛機汽油主顧之第五位、次於法國、英國、南非及英屬東非、今年首六個月、日本佔購買美國飛機油之第三位、僅次法、英二國、去年六月份及去年首六個月、日本向美購買飛機汽油之數字、爲二四·二二一桶及三四一·二八六桶、（一日合衆社電）</p>
<p>倫敦　路透社外交訪員稱、美國飛機油輸出西半球外之禁令、在倫敦權威方面觀之、乃美國防備侵略的政策中之一種天然步驟、蓋保持若干種重要物品之充分供給、係自衛動作中之必要辦法也、就英國所受影響而言、此間工業界謂、英國能從地球各處輸人燃料、此亦爲英國力量偉大之一證、（一日路透社電）</p>
<p>香港　東京電日海軍發言人、今日招待記者、論及美國禁止將飛機所用汽油輸至美洲以外問題、據稱美方此舉、不論其藉口如何、均可認爲美國反日或在經濟上對日實施壓力之表現、禁運一事、自爲對日之非友好行動、美國苟復此而行、則美國或有不得不充分考慮國際上所生反響之一日云、美籍記者繼稱美方此舉、當係針對歐洲之交戰國而發、發言人答曰、美方當係對德義而發、此種辦法、係一舉而兩得、記者問美國此舉、對日軍軍事行動有無影響、發言人躊躇少頃、答曰吾、（一日電）</p>
<p>東京　日海軍省發言人大隈大佐頃聲稱、羅斯福總統禁止航空汽油輸往西半球以外之國家、已毫無疑義爲一反日行動、不論美國如何籍口、此舉已無疑爲一反日之行動、意在對日施行經濟壓迫、是乃一極不友誼之反日行爲、有詢以美國此舉、或係對付德意、何得便認爲反日、大隈答云「羅斯福恐係欲以一箭射死雙鵬耳、」（一日令衆社電）</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>日本舉辦的國際測騐</h3>
<p>日本當局最近以所謂搜索外國諜報機關的理由之下，突然逮捕東京神戶各地著名英僑十三人；同樣措施的範圍，并已推演及於華北淪陷區；路透社東京主任訪員考克斯氏，且於被捕後墮樓慘死。這當然是英日兩國間極嚴重的現象，英國輿情激昂，英國富局亦不復能絨默；但聞英國所提抗議，日方認爲絕無理由而拒絕加以玫慮。</p>
<p>任何兩國交惡至於發現類此現象，原來不難推定其前途。蓋間諜工作與反間諜工作，性質上皆是有組織，有計畫，有政治軍事意味的國家行爲，且往往惟有存在於懷有敵意的兩國之間。間諜是國家隱藏的觸鬚，是化裝於最前綫的哨兵；本國必儘量掩護他，對方則必竭力從事於防範與撲滅。假定發現了眞性的大規模間諜案，無異於兩國圖窮七見，短兵相接的開始。同時，却也絕對沒有證據不足，不恤打草驚蛇，以致妨礙自己的反間諜工作，而冒昧從事於公然逮捕的。國際的間諜寃獄，除非在政治窳敗，警探橫行不法的國家，決不會發生的；反之，國家行動性質的寃獄、是對於對方的侮辱與挑釁。我們從東京與倫敦兩國當局的兩面之辭，雖於黑白情僞旣能得到一種明暸的印象，仍不必代爲斷言於寃或不寃；然亦無論其爲寃或不寃，總之，不是短兵相接，便是侮辱挑釁。這在任何其他兩國，爲政策，爲榮譽，乃至於估量彼此實力之餘，當可立即顯示若此交惡的必然趨歸；僅有例外，便是今日的英日</p>
<p>「英國在歧途上」，本報昨日已加申論。蓋英國當局對日本的意識，大多時代錯誤；旣以爲際此生死關頭，再不能增加正面的敵人；又以爲只有讓步，纔能換取日本善意的中立；復以爲英國讓步政策可以扶助日本溫和分子之拾頭，防範極端分子蠻幹；他的見解如此，故這一次對於東京逮捕英僑案，雖明知其爲對於榮譽的侮辱，對於實力的挑釁，但是否唾面自乾，是否以牙還牙，還待英國對自身的一切，再作估價之後，始能明白。英國若此，日本亦在歧途。</p>
<p>云何日本亦在歧途？日本米內內閣的政策，當然隨上月十六日的總辭職而消逝，迄今閱十七日之久，誰能知道日本新政策究竟是何內容？近衛非不大言炎炎，謂必從速解決所謂中國事變，謂外交不但應付。不但消極的自主，且須爲今後三五十年之計，把握前途，自動創作；莫謂從發表此類片段的談片，以迄實現，不知究有幾許可能，不知需要幾許時光，即從打算開步走起始，也還有種種不同的方向，不同的途徑。不同的態度，不同的手法與步驟。若說不顧一切，特立獨行；則內在的，要看力量，要看氣魄；外在的，要看對方反應。如所謂解決中國事變，中國却決心保衛主權領土而不屈服於侵略。如强化德義日軸心，要看德義在血戰半途，得了局部勝利，怎樣纔理睬日本？如排擠英法在遠東的權益，要看英法是否俯首帖耳再三退讓？這些未來的前途，有其種種不同的可能，可至少有一半，操之於對方的中國，或德義，或英法，而不是日本所能操縱自如；難道近衛已經預知了一切，乃能把握住一切嗎？若使近衛竟然知一切，能一切，則不但不會上台旬餘，緘默迄今；亦不會有逮捕英僑的舉措。</p>
<p>據日本方面對於所謂「檢查各國諜報機關」所非正式發表的：英國在日設有大規模的組織，日人稱之爲「諜報宣傳機關」；羅舉工作，一謂宣傳綱要在乎誘導日本親英反德，二謂宣傳對象乃爲日本元老重臣與社會上層以及言論界有力者與中堅分子，三謂宣傳方法要在發布小册子消息與影片云云；這顯然是各國國際宣傳的普遍工作，非所謂諜報，更不是間諜。罪在如此「諜報宣傳」，而被捕者竟至於畏罪自殺，寗非怪事？於是推想逮捕英僑，完全不是這麼一回事，日本在今日，有其憧憬的天堂，却父雙足深陷泥淖而上天無路。他希望英國俯首帖耳，再三退讓，却又不知道英國朝野對英國自身的一切，究竟作何估價？他希望德義肯與沆瀣一氣，但德義昂然已在勝利的中途，如何秋波，始邀愛寵？逮捕英僑，是對英對德的兩重測騐。英國方面激昂幾分鐘，誠不可知；而柏林對於此事，祗是冷然曰：「不足爲奇、英國在歐洲各國京城，均設有間諜機關」云</p>

<h3>金融　港方拋出外匯</h3>
<p>外滙昨日市况、滙豐掛牌、悉無上落、英美滙暗市、以港電及投機商力售下、續見微鬆、然外行吃胃頗佳、而市面仍有利多流言、故走鬆之勢、極爲緩慢、且午後華行又扒、美行進意濃密、價則穩定不變、晚收結果、英金告三辦士八七五、美滙爲五元九六八七五、較隔昨收市、美各硬〇三一二五、論期貨情况與現貨一樣、九月份已不乏成交、</p>
<p>美金一度出六元</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條、近遠均平、紐約銀價亦平、倫敦生金呆定、滙兌英對美不動、對滬未更、對法無市、美對英長一分、對滬小七分、對法無市、中央掛牌各滙如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金三辦士八五九三七五、美滙五元九三七五、較之前收、英長〇一五六二五、美則平定、開後港電首塞、華行上海亦吐、故市面硬化、計賣予外行現美滙五元九六八七五、嗣美行運通曾售予華商八月份美滙五元九六八七五、與現貨價相近、滙豐掛脾揭曉勿動、白銀平衡稅揭曉亦無增减、此後華商投機家及沙遜等繼續吐出、趨勢愈鬆、計有利外行入投機商及沙遜八月份美滙爲六元、現貨六元〇三一二五、且不久港電又塞予外行同月美匯長至六元〇三一二五、先令最硬告三辦士八七五、時聞市上傳九月十五日「新中央銀行」發鈔之說人心於猜疑之中、市面復軟、計投機商扒進九月份美滙爲五元九〇六二五、午收結果英金爲三辦士八五九三七、美滙五元九六八七五、比晨開英平美硬〇三一二五、</p>
<p>午後又稍見帶緊</p>
<p>午後市面尚平、初美行吃進現先令略硬爲三辦士八七五、嗣華行大陸八月份美滙價五元九六八七五與九三七五、此後迄收盤止、變動毫無、結果英金三辦士八七五、美滙五元九六八七五、八月份英金三辦士八五九三七五、美滙五元九三七五、九月份英金三辦士八四三七五、美滙五元八四三七五、較上日英美兩滙、期現均各長〇三一二五、</p>

<h3>金市徘徊　出入於五千四百元</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、續於平疲潛勢之中、塲內賣戶充斥、扒者相當遜色、雖後市收盤前曾起一度買風、卒因散戶等反手回吐、收盤價仍告低賤、晨開爲五千四百三十元、卽聞外滙走硬、金號錢兌業猛塞至烈、霎時慘落至五千三百三十元、嗣後賴錢兌業與證劵幫維持、午收告五千三百九十元、午後初開人心較好、爲五千四百二十元、惟錢兌業金號再來求售、復挫達五千三百九十元、而忽有金號銀號幫散戶等突起搜購、一時升至五千四百四十五元、奈高價易引起散多等回吐、收盤僅五千四百〇五元、較上日軋小十元、全天交易約二千數百兩、銀樓飾金一度掛小、後則回平、海關金等呆定、</p>
<p>烚赤軋跌十元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初以滙市雖平、惟人心帶疲、賣者頗多、首由銀號對做二十兩、爲五千四百三十元、比前收略高十五元、繼因金號錢兌業及銀號幫等爭先傾塞、且斯時滙市報硬、進者奇少、不久竟慘落一百元金號出證劵幫十兩、退爲五千三百三十元、旋某錢兌業首肯補空、加之證劵幫與散戶接踵復進、故未幾回升二十元、金號進錢兌業十兩、升爲五千三百五十元、此後因銀號幫吐出、曾又退至五千三百四十元、十一時許、錢兌業吃胃殷健、不時前來搜入、且匯市略軟、因之買風漸盛、迨收盤時已回升五十元，證券幫進金號二十兩、爲五千三百九十元、收後因市上忽有某銀行卽發鈔票之說、銀號幫吸收更力、竟提升至五千四百十元、午後開市稍漲、首由錢兌業進銀號等五十兩、爲五千四百二十元、旋金號及銀號吐出、步小三十元、銀號互做二十兩、爲五千三百九十元、後因某銀號突興買意、且不久金號亦跟跡在扒、復又飛躍五十五元、銀號進錢兌業二十兩、爲五千四百四十五元、入後買風漸散、錢兌業與浮多先後吐售、迨收市已回小四十元、銀號進同業十兩、爲五千四百零五元作晚收價、結果比上日軋跌十元、全天一百十五元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤較高數十元、收進减低三十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十餘元、均鮮做開、</p>
<p>飾金欲小又止</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、初時大同行仍懸五百六十元、迨十時一刻掛小十元、午後二時〇五分回起十元、結果大同行依舊懸五百六十元、新同行與上價相仿、收進减低三十元光景、</p>
<h3>美票升降靡常</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市况、烚赤漸呈盤勢、英美金鎊變動亦小、終告微跌五角、英金票供求仍勻、市價站平、美金票一度退至十六元五角一分、午後會高至十六元七角五分、卒又退至十六元六角七分、比上日軋跌三分、香港票需要不繼、市價站平、日金票及朝鮮票均轉跌勢、前者退爲一元二角六分牛、後者降爲一元零八分半、</p>
<h3>證券　丁種漲一元零</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨市已見轉漲、惟以轉漲較猛、引起多方出籠及放空、午後復稍稍回落、但仍比上日爲堅、以各帮人氣及信心揣測、前途仍是漲易跌難、惟環境上變化甚多、謠言忽起忽滅、投機家乃亦疲於奔命、待有劇烈變化、始有鉅大漲跌也、昨日交易、以甲丙戊三種爲最熱閙、乙丁兩種極爲稀少、買戶通記同順鼎康長康及胡鶴記均有購進、聯和則始終出脫、久豐中一永祥協大賣出亦不弱、交易頗稱踴躍、其中以捨此取彼、互相掉換交易爲多、競爭結果、除丁種因隔日下午未有做開、獨漲一元一角爲最多外、餘仍續好五分至三角不等、成交總數約計一百萬元有奇、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交國華銀行股五十股、價為五十五元正、</p>
<p>眾業昨日股市續形黯淡、成交稀少、價格不更、除非時局有一種確定的變動、或正或反、市況似將滯留在一種狹溢範疇內、而少生氣、蓋依目下情况、價格有跌落、卽有買戶來購、反之稍有漲風、賣戶卽接踵來售也、</p>
<p>倫敦三十一日（週三）電、今日中國外債及遠東英商各公司股票掛牌行市、祗銀行股稍有上落、計麥加利銀行續漲三先令九便士、價爲七鎊、滙豐銀行英倫註冊股跌三鎊、價爲六十五鎊、又香港註册股跌二鎊、價為六十八鎊、其餘不動、</p>
<h3>紗花　棉紗多頭　尚未放棄</h3>
<p>紗市又入平疲之途、此因外滙回長、黃金趨下、而實銷不旺、所以人心轉疲、多方鑒於環境不良、舉動乏力、但大部份仍不放棄、因之市盤尚軟中帶硬、前途變化、須恃實際地位爲伸縮也、</p>
<p>現紗晨開、因外滙勿動、而塲中新買戶不盛、氣勢暗淡無勁、開小盤二十支雙馬價爲九百八十元、比上日跌六元、旋聞滙票放長、實銷平凡、浮多了結、直跌至九百七十元內、但某多頭上日吐出之額、今則復來補進、市况又見回好、至九百七十八元、收盤以後、又爲疲象、查半日間成交統計一千三百八十包、行情二十支雙馬跌十元、昨有紗九十件運天津、茲將各帮口買去之額量分列如左、</p>
<h3>訂貨尚未售罄　棉商無購買力</h3>
<p>現棉交易仍少新發展、此因海外美印棉市依然呆滯無特色、加之國內紗銷不暢、廠方興趣减色、至於同業、「則鑒於實際狀况不靈、二則各方　訂之貨、未能售罄、所以亦無新的購買力也、火機草包價爲一百四十九元至一百五十元、係棧交、</p>
<p>另訊外棉市價、紐約棉市市况殊爲靜寂、先因大衆之賣出、續後則因一部份之多頭了結、結果收盤價格、較之上日跌落二三磅音、印度棉市昨日連同預測亦跌一羅比、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、各方俱靜寂異常、終日竟無只包交易、同業間以市上存底不豐、</p>
<h3>棉紗投機求盈反虧　勢成弩末難以挽頹勢　跋前疐後進退大狼狽</h3>
<p>最近一月以來之棉紗市塲、變遷情形、亦有回顧之價値，</p>
<p>（一）上月自多頭破裂以後、一瀉數百元、二十支雙馬跌至八百元、</p>
<p>（二）在本月初紗業因其下降已鉅，以爲不妨再拖進做多、因之奄奄不振之市態、徐徐回蘇、且傳華南一帶可以裝運、然實際由大鵬灣裏沙魚涌口岸轉往內地運輸之手續、異常艱巨、不過香港幫雖各躉批採辦、然零星交易較活絡多矣、於是授機之戶又作久蟄思動之舉、大衆買進、紗市得此推波助瀾之援助、復出千元大關、曾至一千零六十二元、詎料市價一高基礎不穩、知足者見風使舵、而行了結迨至本月十六日報載日軍封鎖浙閩海口、一日間暴落一百三四十元之巨、敲破九百元關、曾達八百八十五元、</p>
<p>（四）浙東軍事好轉、鎭海克復、人心重振、抬價之念、死灰復燃、查其做作範圍稍廣、廠方開進期貨幾千包、一方面再向市塲上將散戶之籌碼卽二十支雙馬廠單收進數百包、或千餘包，一時塲上形勢頓見熱烈、流言　起、市面要看漲、有大大的轉機、苗頭來了、因銀根鬆懈、承做押款較易，好像狂風復起、由九百十七元、兩日天直漲至九百九十元、一般以爲千元可出關、在目前不料市價雖步步前進、然新買者依然缺乏、獲利之戶反見出檔、因之市盤欲漲反跌二十元外、此外尚有下列情形、足爲紗市前途障礙、（一）上半年投機商結賬、大　求盈反虧、大受打擊、實力絞弱、（二）棉紗存貨日厚、生產與消費不能平衡、（三）華南國際運輸綫自被阻後、現改由彼口岸輾轉運往內地、（四）與某紗價格距離太遠、同等之紗、要相差一百九十元、（五）米珠薪桂、遑論衣着、所以布銷更滯、小型布廠紛紛停閉、（六）至於客幫方面、因運輸困難、價格過高、卽束手放棄不多辦、如遇相當、則吸胃較健、所以無積極旺辦之舉、（七）且原料價値平平、本年美國棉花田畝增加、新棉生產情形有增加之望、</p>
<p>就以上實際狀况論、目前紗布趨勢、投機雖處心積慮欲其上漲、有所難能也、</p>
<p>不願廉價出售、廠方則亦以非價廉之最低限度、而不願購買、故俱在相持中、</p>
<h3>糖市　廣幫收進　粗白千包</h3>
<p>昨糖市因前日所傳東印度事、係屬無稽、致人心軟化遂見回鬆、公會割盤現貨二四粗白、本棧六十七元八角至六十八元、小五角、外棧上午六十七元六角至三角、下午六十七元六角至八角、小七角、轉口貨卽打棧單者五十二元至五十二元一角、小九角、八月十五日交貨五十三元小一元、廣幫吃胃最多、獨進千包之譜、荷赤八月五日到船交貨五十六元半、太古車白B裝七十二元半、小元半、本廠雪白六十八元半、小五角、一號冰八十九元、晶明冰九十允半、均小一元、</p>
<h3>煤炭　白煤屑復原盤</h3>
<p>鴻基二號白煤屑、此次新貨裝到以來、同業行拆、初做過駁貨每噸一百十元、旋同煤球跌價、亦跟小十四元行情、今又恢復原價、仍開一百十元老盤、以煤球廠同業爲限、市塲手貨、喊一百念元、本街門莊、每祖六元二角云、</p>
<h3>糧食　米價回跌</h3>
<p>現洋米市前日一度暴漲、昨已回落、當期存積豐足、來源不絕、而欲大肆操縱、反使作客價高棘手、然米轟作崇不已、前途稍有變化、投機可以立起、良以米市塲管理徒託空言、終鮮成效、故欲米價平準、只有嚴格管制之一法、委之於米商之手、安得不暗中自相迴護、路貨暹米又將有四千八百噸一船到申、現洋米頓時抑低六七角至近元、回籠原包二號西貢初開五十九元半小至五十七元七角、二號暹米自五十五元半小至五十八元八角、而進戶依然觀望、後市如無大帮問津、則市面終呈下遊之象、全日回籠原包祗開一百七十五噸、現米不逾四千包、昨有洋米三百廿八包、裝永生輪運往烟台、</p>
<p>粳糯國米均無到貨、交易平常、而售價未有上落、悉稱定格、常帮鮮淸粳六十五六元、無錫淸粳六十五元、常泗蘇崑粳高自六十三四元次六十一元、薄稻仍無開出、南港斛早五十九元、次至縮五十七元、金溧白元五十六七元、特別五十八元、常丹白元五十四五元、香港白元五十五元、特別五十六七元、</p>
<h3>粉價穩定</h3>
<p>麵明定粉暗堅、蓋自廠盤改爲十五元後、本客雖無大宗去化、而零銷已增多、市乃漸臻穩定、日廠粉一再貶跌、亦以成本攸關、堅持不出、故市塲回籠貨已喊高至十四元、尚無　批售出、內地雜牌粉存到兩少、統市成交除華廠粉批出六千餘包外、其他雜粉交易、不足三千包云、</p>
<p>小麥昨日跌風亦戢、蓋目下閘北虹口、雖有到貨、大部份待價而沽、日廠一再壓抑、最低價僅開十八元左右、華廠以租界內運入數量極微、亦不願過於放價收買、故市面已連擯數日、昨聞日廠進胃略貪、吃盤十八元五角、華廠收進二三千包、扯價二十元零五角、市面漸趨定局、</p>
<p>今日有大量麵粉、計三萬包運往福建、前日（三十一日）有二千包、由香港裝南寗輪運來、該粉係澳大利福洋行出品（祖）</p>
<h3>雜糧銷場狹隘</h3>
<p>雜糧交易雕不寂寥、但銷塲狹隘、發展無力、投機手腕無從下手、良以市况平淡無特色、至於來源陸續有到、故大都暫居供多求少、惟高貨黃夏則反因之市氣堅定、中次則轉呈軟勢、昨共祗做開安慶豆五百餘包、價自二十八元至二十七完二角、北港毛家市靑蠶豆三百包、價爲十九元至十八元八角、及明光毛綠豆百餘包、價爲十九元五角而已、有豆餅二千五百片運福建、</p>
<h3>海味　烟台尾開出一批</h3>
<p>烟台開洋尾、近到一批、昨已開出、計上莊二百七十二元、中莊二百五十七元、市象尚俏、</p>
<h3>疋頭　重重困難中　小型布廠　已屆沒落之期</h3>
<p>自從上月紗價急劇下降，一般小型布廠，却早已進足一千五六百元（或竟有一千七百多元的）廿支紗，和七百多元約上支紗，八九百元約十二支紗的原料的，所有以前拋出的高價成品（棉布定貨），客戶方面，因布價的一落千丈，（與市價最高峯時每疋粗布或粗斜有跌落至十元外之鉅的，）以及越南的交通不通，閩浙海岸的被强制封鎖，棉布去路停頓，怎願客戶備款出貨（棉布）拉在自己頭上吃虧呢！於是客戶都不顧一切的實行甩鑰匙（犧牲定銀，不出貨，如果出貨，還要比犧牲每疋一元或五角的定銀，犧牲來得大呢，）主義了。另一方面，紗廠却催告織布廠限期出貨，急如星火！如逾一個月不出貨者，於八月十日起，棧租，保險費，下力三項，每件須收三五元，布廠處於兩面夾攻之痛苦下，再核算自己十磅重一疋的標準成本，依然需二十二三元，（紗本十六元左右，再加每疋開緻費六七元，）而市値？却在二十元內外了！（高峯時會到過三十多元，每疋至少有凈利六七元，）於是虧蝕　　，資財不充的，無力支持，立刻宣告淸　，只得關門大吉了。據調查本市各大小織布廠，約共有三百餘家之多，其中電機木機各半，今春製品銷路，尚極暢旺，自經此次大變，實行出頂抬盤，已有十餘家之多。而準備停業中的，還有卅家呢。卽使紗廠有連布廠或資力雄厚，範圍較大的，也都實行减班，减工了。平常開一千台布機的，這時减開三分之一，（卽减去三百卅餘台）或竟减開三分之二，或僅做日班而停止夜班。這種不利情勢的繼續下去，必將有完全停機的一天！（島客）</p>
<h3>袖裏洋布大有成交</h3>
<p>馬鬃袖裏（卽馬鬃緞）、近日成交數可觀、專營裏襯店戶幫、及呢羢業大批發戶、均有定貨、專跑洋服舖掮客跑街、亦有訂定之、顏色大部份　色、洪盛·寅豐·導華·仁泰·大同·寳新·寳昌·美新·振新等廠、均有定開、聞寅豐鑫記生意更忙、因可打運銷執照、行銷外埠而出口耳、花洋布亦大有成交、查其定價大半比現貨售價便宜三四角不等、（各廠且多守秘密互做暗盤）、</p>
<h3>南北貨　冷氣湘蓮見漲</h3>
<p>湘蓮前市曾到一百七十五元、但本湖蓮多數已進冷氣棧、成本見增、故近市四價反緊、昨冷氣貨行盤四二百元、須升二十餘元、</p>

<p>英租界大禮拜堂之花園，內有一潭，恃以爲備豫不虞者，乃近因天久亢旱，潭水漸涸，於是集機器洋龍四座，於上禮拜五晚接長皮帶，自海關碼頭外浦中吸水以實潭，乃從十點鐘至十一點鐘，各人用力從事，而潭水不過增三尺有奇，蓋因皮帶長至一百三十五丈，壓力必須加重，皮帶遂有破裂之處，故須遲數日再行補吸云。</p>
<p>鑑湖挅蓮櫂歌</p>
<p>紅綠亭亭相對　，一聲款乃撥輕艭；穿花直到花深處，戲數鴛鴦宿幾雙。越女如花花見羞，沙棠一葉鏡中游；幾回相問諸儔侶，可有蓮花采並頭。生紗衫子熟羅衣，却爲新晴露未晞；掩映花叢還隱約，綠波疑是出靈妃。參差紅綠認糢糊，露積荷盤尚似珠；只爲著來羅綺薄，花香容易沁肌膚。儂家生長若耶溪，小小風流未及笄，怪底玲瓏疑玉腕，頻將雪藕比柔荑。凌波雙瓣小於蓮，試踏蓮花步步妍；都是西施采蓮後，鑑湖五月蕩蓮船。</p>

<h3>誤送煎藥</h3>
<p>— 秦常</p>
<p>一個人不幸而生病，延醫診治，這時候他的生命可以說完全交付了醫生，本刊的關於「藥渣」的文中，述及藥渣倒在街心路口，是使行醫見了可以知道前醫用藥之是否有錯誤，現在自然談不上這些，以致相傳下來，祗是一種例行公事而已。</p>
<p>幾年以前，各國藥號爲營業競爭計，有代客煎藥部之設，這確實是便利病家的好辦法。有些較重的病症，因爲自己贖藥煎藥要費去相當時間，躭誤病人的也有；而機關，公廠等等的職員，自己煎藥，更是事實上所不可能。所以代客煎藥不但是求本身營業的發展，同時在病家亦有莫大利益。可是前天的報上讀到一則誤送煎藥，幾乎送病人的性命的新聞。</p>
<p>這種錯誤的發生，或許在於職員輕易的疏忽，可是其招致的結果，不能爲了輕易的疏忽而卸責的。本來到藥店去贖藥，職員依方配藥以後，更有一人專司校對之職，如無錯誤，然後將藥方繫紥在藥包之上，病家取藥也有配藥號碼爲憑，這樣科學化的分工合作，照例是不致發生錯誤的，代客煎藥當然也有專司其職的人及分別標幟，因爲煎了的成藥更不容易發現配藥的有吾錯誤，更何况誤送了。</p>
<p>在病人把生命交付了醫生之後，他也是把生命交付了藥　的，所以要避免這種錯誤的發生，每個職員應該隨時隨地，無時無刻把全部注意力灌注在自己的職資上，不容有問髮的疏忽的。</p>

<p>這是一件痛心的事：昨日下午，我家來了二位三弟的同學，他們要問三弟商量借一張上學期（廿八年度下學期）的成績單，因爲他們有三位朋友，二位因升級發生困難，要想換學校；一位預備下學期跳入高一學年的班次，但缺少相當證明文件，所以想借三張成績單，他們知道三弟的成績單沒有用，想暫借一用。我一向聽說上海有少數學校有賣買文憑這回事，却不料還有成績單借貸這把戲呢！被好奇心所動，就問道：「成績單上的姓名和年，月，年級不是要不符了嗎？」於是他們告訴我：先向成績較佳的同學或在學朋友處借得成績單，然後用精細的方法將成績單上的姓名，年，月和年級設法磨去，再用與成績單上同色的墨水和筆調，寫上投考者的姓名和適當年，月，年級，這樣就可投考任伺要考的年級了。他們又加補充說：跳級的一位朋友，原可用自己的，因成績較差，不好看，所以也決定向人借用。他們的說明完畢後，我對他們「坦白」的態度，和「巧妙」的方法，佩服得五體投地，然而我却不願三弟也投入犯罪的淵池中，就立卽自作主張很抱歉地拒絕了，我預測他們一定很不高興吧？</p>
<p>我目送着二位受敎育者的背影，一個模糊的「？」在我眼前閃爍。</p>
<p>更正　二十八日挿畫下對話爲蒼蠅甲：喂！你老是息在這兒幹什麼呀？蒼蠅乙：你不知道這兒的奶油眞够味！上句漏一「這」字，下句漏一「兒」字，特此更正。</p>
<h3>揮淚返故鄉</h3>
<p>這是有關北方學生的事，我希望敎育界的先生們，注意一下。</p>
<p>處在北方的學生們，尤其是在文化城北平的學生，他們無時無地不在期望着有到南方來贖嘗的機會，但是關於經濟，家長的同意都是問題，結果南來的都是小組的十數個人一同來，而且大都是大，中學的畢業生。</p>
<p>鄙人等此次從北方來，抱着很大的希望，雖然在北平往南來是很危險的，但是我們仍舊的扮成商人，或各業的小職員，偷偷地前來，結果終於到達了上海。我們的目的當然是考大學，首先考交大，交大的職員只說證明書有問題，但也允許考試；至於到其他私立大學反不收留，因此不但使我們的熱望消滅下去，而且使我們生了反感。</p>
<p>現在我們請問教育界一下，是不是入學要憑資格（文憑或證明書）而不問學業；中國爾民在中學畢業難道不能入中國的大學麼；豈上海敎育界的先生們不承認北方的學生是中華民國的」份子麼？</p>
<p>現在我們幾位同學在失望之後依然打道北返了，從此以後南來的學生定然很少，中國現在正需要靑年，我相信這是一種損失！　（從故都南來的一羣學生）</p>
<p>霍桑探案</p>
<h3>舞后的歸宿</h3>
<p>— 程小青著</p>
<p>霍桑把鑰匙放進了他的衣袋，另從胸口袋裏摸出那張二吋的小照片來給我瞧。那是方頦稜目的趙伯雄。我倒呆了一呆。</p>
<p>他道：「翻過來瞧啊。」語聲中似乎有些不耐。</p>
<p>我忙把照片翻轉來，果然有「亞東七七四」五個鉛筆字，那字迹小而且淡，寫得也不大高明。</p>
<p>霍桑道：「我猜想這五個字是王麗蘭的手筆。」</p>
<p>「那末是亞東旅館嗎？」我說着仍將照片還給霍桑。</p>
<p>霍桑略點點頭，又爬到了駕駛盤的座上，把汽車掉過頭來，一直向北進行。他忽問我道：「你帶着手槍嗎？」</p>
<p>我暗暗一驚，想不到會這樣嚴重。我答道：「沒有啊。你呢？」</p>
<p>霍桑點點頭：「我是隨身的。」</p>
<p>我又道：「我們不是去找趙伯雄嗎？怎麼用得着手槍？我倒有些奇怪。」</p>
<p>「看趙伯雄一定用不着手槍，這話才奇怪。」他頓了一頓，讓汽車轉　向東，又繼續說；「你須明白，我們現在既然還不知道那一個是兇手——第一個是開槍打王　蘭的人，那末，我們對於任何一個嫌疑人，都得戒備着他有隨時開槍的可能。」他又頓了一頓，補充說：「連陸健笙也不能例外。」</p>
<p>這句話我又認爲有些突兀。「什麼？陸健笙也不能例外？他也有兇手嫌疑？」霍桑的眼睛瞧着馬路的中央。這時汽車已入了鬧市，駕駛上不能不加意些。我雖發了這個耐不住的問句，心裏倒有些不好意思。因爲這時候委實不應向駕駛人討論這樣疑難的問題。</p>
<p>霍桑却仍從容地答道：「誰知道呢？我常對你說，一個科學家在從事研究工作的時候，決不能先抱着某種成見。他必須憑着了無翳障的頭腦，敏銳地觀察，精密地求證，和忠實地搜集一切足資研討的材料，然後才能歸納出一個結論。」</p>
<p>奇怪，他竟唱起高調來了。我老實說，這陸健笙旣然是個出首告發的人，實在不像有行兇的嫌疑。　（六三）</p>
<h3>新女性及其他</h3>
<p>— 陳端波</p>
<p>「湖絲阿姐」「錫包娘子」「襪廠里的嫂嫂」……，這類不平常的名字，是尊稱呢，還算是侮辱？</p>
<p>新女性在中國的舊社會里是遭人鄙視的，遺棄的，一般人以為一個女人進入了工廠，就像與操皮肉生涯者差不多的卑賤，輕浮。因之在低級趣味里，下層階級的嘴里，湖絲阿姐被編入猥褻的曲調；而香烟廠里的女工也被呼爲錫包「壳子」，這些我們隨處可以聽到的。在工廠將放上下工汽笛的時候，我們在馬路上時常可以發現下流的人向女工們調笑，勾搭，釘梢。</p>
<p>一所工廠里的女工者祗少有幾十個，最多的要算是湖絲棧與香烟廠，最少的範圍也得有幾百人。他們的籍貫各異，而來自亦不同。他們有家庭中的婦女；也有被學校里擠出來的；最多的是從破落的農村里奔來追尋飯吃的，所謂是「鄉下姑娘」；還有甚至於三姑六婆，穿針引綫的王婆，醉翁之意不在酒的販賣人口的娼婦，產在這許多烏合之衆里，於是便產生了什麼「十朶花」呀，「拜乾娘」呀，「十姊妹」呀，……等等一類怪狀。於是樸質的被變成了奢侈，愼重的引成了輕浮，他們這一羣意志薄弱初入社會的靑年，外遭狂蜂浪蝶的勾引，內受小姊妹淘的及無恥的職工們誘惑，怎不失足陷阱，而鬧上種種的悲劇來呢？</p>
<p>筆者去年曾服務於××烟廠，更眼見上流人物的老闆與智識階級的職員也卑其人格施效下流的手段，而他們受着生活的鞭策，不敢有毫末的反抗，這是事實，是沒有一字盧文的事實。雖然我也曾看到幾個女工是自去招致在蜂浪蝶的。</p>
<p>一個生產女性日夜伏在機器聲浪中過活，確是令我們可佩的。這些女工都是爲了殘酷的生活，爲生活而遭受到種種的創傷，而掙到幾塊可憐的麵包，但是大部份的女工爲什麼濃妝淡抹，打扮得花枝招展呢？又爲什麼把很自然的靑絲燙得捲曲，把一件樸素堅牢的藍布旗袍換上一件花花綠綠的印花洋布呢？我實不敢寫下去，不忍寫下去了！</p>

<p>㳺藝界</p>
<h3>南來新角藝事紀</h3>
<p>— 語初</p>
<p>黃金與更新俟毛世來譚富英演期滿後，或將歇夏數日，秋凉開鑼，黃金已的定李盛藻，童芷苓，高盛麟，等一班；更新原擬邀孫毓堃，宋德珠，王鴻福，演唱一期，今改由吳素秋先行登台，故孫毓堃一班，須俟吳演畢，接彼之後隊，繼之露演半月。者番吳素秋來滬，其班中老生一席，聞巳邀妥遲世恭承乏，小生有的兪振飛之說，現正在進行接洽中。</p>
<p>觀此二班中，滬人之未會謀面而尚係初次蒞滬獻藝者，得二人：其一爲童芷苓，另一爲遲世恭，筆者對彼二伶之身世藝事，略知一二，誌之於後，以作介紹。</p>
<p>童芷苓</p>
<p>乃新進之坤伶雋才，向在天津之北洋及新中央等各名劇院挑班露演，捧之者不乏其人，在津沽一帶，頗爲走紅。其父係一學者，因家况淸寒，命女習藝謀生，初無籍籍名，待由人介紹，得列入苟慧生之門牆後，名遂大彰，藝亦猛進。最近赴平公演，甚獲當地各界之贊許，已皇皇然擠於京朝大角之列矣。芷苓花衫刀馬兼工，，扮相秀麗，風姿頗健，召風亦佳，嗓音甜潤，惜乎不能拔高，凡荀派之虹霓關，玉堂春，穆柯寨等劇，均稱傑作，並擅演最受滬人歡迎之「紡棉花」劇。</p>
<p>遲世恭</p>
<p>係富運成社五科弟子，在科時與棄世長，沙世鑫，並稱老生三傑，爲老伶工遲子俊之孫，(遲子俊跟隨老譚多年，擅演探親家類丑婆戲，現尚健在。）黎園之世家也。其藝事以平穩見長，不若時下一般後輩伶人，喜習馬派，取其花巧而易於討好，然究難免流於油滑，浮而不實，不足效法，故獨喜世恭之能以規矩爲主。嗓音高亮，惟稍欠寬宏，彼倒嗆之期巳過，目鑒於沙世鑫之來滬，適逢倒嗆方過，嗓音悶黯，以致　羽而歸，故此來胸有成竹，當不致復蹈世鑫之覆轍，故深信其嗓音必已恢復而臻於堅實之境地矣。其做派頗老練穩重，目細膩而傳神，道白淸晰，抑揚分明，台風亦佳，惜不擅靠把，戲路隨之不寬，是彼惟一弱點。捉放之陳宮，與夫失空斬之孔明，均爲其撒手　。</p>
<h3>敬告滑稽界</h3>
<p>滑稽戲自江笑笑（滑稽公會會長王旡能（已故）發明至今，已有二十餘年的歷史。在過去，它因適合一般人的口味，所以非常盛行；但至今，唱滑稽者已如雨後春笋，因此造成三種對於滑稽界本身有危險性的現象；筆者爲了愛護滑稽界，所以爽直的寫述於后，希望滑稽界多多注意︰</p>
<p>（一）滑稽戲變相　近來有大部份唱滑稽者祇知道拿了唱詞集，合了樂器，像唸經般高唱一遍，却忽略了他們主要任務——引人開口大笑；因此唱滑稽者無形中變成唱小曲者，有名而無實。</p>
<p>（二）買曲作唱料有一批唱滑稽者，自己不動臘筋專向編唱詞者購買不含「笑料」且無「意義」之唱詞，作爲自己的唱詞，因此愛聽的人漸漸厭惡而放棄聽滑稽的心念了。</p>
<p>（三）偷唱還有一批唱滑稽界者，聽見別人唱曲，便偷學了作爲自己的唱料，因此你會唱，他也會唱，害得一般聽眾聽得頭痛。</p>
<p>以上三點是近來滑稽界的普遍現象，若再不圖改進，勢必逐漸落伍而淘汰；希望滑稽界諸藝員，能力圖改進，闢一更生之途；這不持筆者個人之見，想愛護滑稽界者，亦有同感。</p>

<h3>怎樣攝製電影？　（四）</h3>
<p>— 德綱</p>
<p>（五）欺騙觀眾的西洋鏡　影片中欺騙觀眾，使觀眾信以為真的西洋鏡，不知有多少，我們來舉幾個有趣而時常遇到的例子來講：在不少片中，觀眾時常會見一個神經病人，或一個想要自殺的朋友，兩手兩脚攀在摩天大厦的牆壁上，漸漸向上爬行，看了使人揑汗不止。爬到高頂時，竟還一躍跳往鄰厦的屋頂上去，若是一個不愼，必然跌得粉身粹骨無疑。這種危險驚人的勾當，拆穿了却一文錢都不值。原來方法是預先在攝影塲的地上，舖了像高厦牆壁的佈景，然後請演員在地上爬動，開麥拉機置在一架很高的梯上，攝影師便把鏡頭垂向地面，對準演員拍攝，片子放映時，看去便如同眞的演員在爬高牆了。</p>
<p>還有一個有趣的欺騙觀衆的技巧，就是演員表演游泳（有時是眞的）或溺死的鏡頭。例如表演溺死，方法極簡單：演員面朝天平臥地上，兩手兩腳向空劃動，裝出掙扎的樣子，開麥拉放得很高，鏡頭向下垂，在鏡頭和演員身子中空距間安放着一玻璃盆的水，演員的動作映過水後，攝入片中，便完全像眞一般，道是個很聰敏的技巧。</p>
<h3>聽聲</h3>
<p>張心齊曰，春聽烏聲，夏聽蟬聲，秋聽虫聲，冬聽雪聲，白畫聽棋聲，月下聽簫聲，山中聽松聲，水際聽款乃聲，方不虛此生耳。若惡少斥辱，悍妻詬誶，眞不若耳聾也。王名友曰，松濤聲，瀑布聲，簫笛聲，潮聲，讀書聲，鐘聲，梵聲，皆宜遠聽；惟琴聲，度曲聲，雪聲，非至近不能得其離合抑揚之妙。憶五六年前，夏夜泛舟西子湖中，月色濛朧，凉風習習，舟中雜陳瓜果，蘭蓀擫笛，余繫節，命女弟曼聲歌牡丹亭玉簪記諸折，舟行傍岸處，摟頭燈火齊明，樓頭人其亦聞聲起　，不知張王二公，亦樂聽此聲吾？大槪聲雖可聽，總要景物相宜，今日聽戲，購票時則須仰面求人，人塲後則擠得一身臭汗，雖有佳聲，已乏雅興。或緣滬地屋窄人衆，以其侷處斗室，母寗廣塲受擠，兼有聲色之樂矣。雖然，仍望戲院主人，於售票公開，售票員態度，及加位置三事，有以改之。</p>

<h3>US Government Bans Export of Aviation Fuel to Various Countries, Excluding Western Hemisphere; Japan Most Affected, Perceiving US Move as Anti-Japanese</h3>
<p>Washington – The US government has recently banned the export of aviation fuel to various countries, except for those in the Western Hemisphere. However, American airlines operating outside the Western Hemisphere will still be permitted to obtain aviation fuel. President Roosevelt's secretary, Mr. Early, told reporters that the Export Control Commissioner, Mr. Maxwell, approved of this measure, and the President then authorized it. As for whether the United States will continue to ship gasoline to Britain, he said he did not know. The US authorities, having permitted American companies to obtain gasoline, will cooperate with Pan American Airways and others operating air services to Portugal and the Pacific routes. (Reuters dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>Washington – Although the US government's ban on aviation fuel exports applies to all countries outside the Western Hemisphere, Japan is the most affected. This is because the European Axis powers are blockaded by Britain and have long been unable to import American oil. Whether this US action is related to the continued oppression and threats faced by Americans in China is unknown, but the announcement of the ban at this time is noteworthy. Britain's supply is unaffected because Canada can still purchase fuel and transfer its existing aviation fuel to Britain. Simultaneously, Britain can also obtain new supplies from Venezuela and other places in Central and South America. (Reuters dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>Washington – A government official told the United Press reporter yesterday that both China and Japan are heavily reliant on American aviation gasoline. However, the impact of President Roosevelt's embargo order is lighter on China than on Japan. Although China's main supply route was blocked after the British closed the Burma Road, Japan, in addition to the United States, relies on the Dutch East Indies and Venezuela for aviation gasoline. However, the latter two can only supply Japan with a small amount of gasoline. It is said that Japan may use aviation gasoline of lower quality than that used by the United States and European countries, as the competition Japanese aircraft face from Chinese aircraft is not very severe. The US Army Department has insisted on using 87 to 100 octane gasoline. Japanese aircraft may use 70 to 75 octane gasoline. According to statistics released by the US Department of Commerce, Japan obtained 5,048 barrels of aviation fuel in June. In the first six months of this year, non-American countries purchased a total of 1,213,662 barrels of aviation gasoline from the United States, of which Japan purchased 105,662 barrels. In June, Japan ranked fifth among customers purchasing US aviation gasoline, behind France, Britain, South Africa, and British East Africa. In the first six months of this year, Japan ranked third in purchasing US aviation fuel, behind only France and Britain. Last June and the first six months of last year, Japan purchased 24,221 barrels and 341,286 barrels of aviation gasoline from the United States, respectively. (United Press dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>London – A Reuters diplomatic correspondent stated that the US ban on aviation fuel exports outside the Western Hemisphere is viewed in authoritative circles in London as a natural step in America's policy of defense against aggression. Maintaining an adequate supply of certain essential commodities is a necessary measure of self-defense. Regarding the impact on Britain, industrial circles here said that Britain can import fuel from all over the world, which is a testament to Britain's great strength. (Reuters dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>Hong Kong – A Japanese naval spokesman in Tokyo, when interviewed by reporters today, commented on the US ban on exporting aviation gasoline to countries outside the Americas, stating that regardless of the US pretext, this move can be seen as anti-Japanese or an expression of economic pressure on Japan. The embargo is an unfriendly act towards Japan. If the United States continues along this path, then the United States may have to fully consider the international repercussions that will arise. An American reporter then said that the US move was aimed at the warring countries in Europe. The spokesman replied that the US was aimed at Germany and Italy, and that this method achieved two goals at once. When asked whether the US move would have any impact on Japanese military operations, the spokesman hesitated for a moment and replied, "We..." (Dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>Tokyo – Japanese Navy Ministry spokesman Colonel Okuma recently stated that President Roosevelt's ban on the export of aviation gasoline to countries outside the Western Hemisphere is undoubtedly an anti-Japanese action. Regardless of the US pretext, this move is undoubtedly an anti-Japanese action, intended to exert economic pressure on Japan, and is an extremely unfriendly anti-Japanese act. When asked whether the US move was aimed at Germany and Italy, and why it should be considered anti-Japanese, Okuma replied, "Roosevelt probably wants to kill two birds with one stone."

<h3>Ma Junwu Passes Away in Guilin</h3>
<p>Guilin – Mr. Ma Junwu, President of Guangxi University, passed away at the university at 6 PM on the 1st due to illness. He had a stomach ailment, and since becoming President of Guangxi University, he had worked tirelessly to reorganize and develop the school. In the last semester, his old illness relapsed, and after several treatments, he did not recover. He continued to work despite his illness and did not take a break. This time, his illness worsened, and doctors were unable to cure him, leading to his death. Mr. Ma was a native of Guilin, 60 years old. He studied in Germany and obtained a doctorate in engineering.

<p>Chongqing – It is claimed here that Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, will not go to the Soviet Union, and Zhu Jiahua, Minister of Organization, will not go to Germany. It is rumored that no Chinese delegation will be sent to the Soviet Union. Recently, it was reported in Hong Kong that the Chongqing government had decided to send special delegations to Germany and the Soviet Union separately, and that Zhu Jiahua had been appointed as the special envoy to Germany, and Sun Ke as the leader of the delegation to the Soviet Union.

<h3>Details of the Downing of Japanese Aircraft Over Chongqing</h3>
<p>Chongqing – At around 12 noon on the 31st, 35 Japanese army bombers attempted to attack the capital of China. When they flew to Beibei, they panicked upon seeing Chinese aircraft, indiscriminately dropped some bombs, and flew north. Later, they flew to the sky over Hechuan, hovering for half an hour, attempting to infiltrate the city airspace from the west of Chongqing. Unexpectedly, they encountered Chinese aircraft over Tongliang. The Chinese launched a fierce attack, and the Japanese aircraft were severely damaged. After hastily dropping bombs in the suburbs of Tongliang, they flew north. One Japanese aircraft crashed into a valley in the northern suburbs of Yunyang Jiangbei due to damage. At around 2 PM, 80 Japanese naval aircraft attacked in three waves. The first two waves simultaneously broke into the city airspace from the north. The Chinese were well-prepared and used a deformable tactics to successively penetrate the Japanese formation and launch a head-on attack. More than a dozen Japanese aircraft were injured and had black smoke coming from their tails. The Chinese aircraft fiercely pursued them. East of Pengshui, four Japanese aircraft that had fallen behind due to severe injuries were shot down separately. The locations are currently being investigated. The third wave of Japanese aircraft, witnessing the disastrous defeat of their first two waves, retreated after wreaking havoc near Fuling. Chongqing issued an all-clear at 3:45 PM. All Chinese aircraft returned safely except for one that did not return. (Dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>Chongqing – According to official announcement, during yesterday's air raid on Chongqing, Chinese fighter planes shot down at least five Japanese bombers. One Chinese plane did not return to base. (Reuters dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>Chongqing – After a two-week rest, Chongqing was bombed again by Japanese aircraft yesterday. Sixty Japanese aircraft participated in the bombing. A bomb was dropped on the Belgian Embassy. When they arrived near Chongqing on the same day, Chinese fighter planes took off to intercept them. The outcome of the battle has not yet been announced. (Haitong dispatch, 1st)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The International Test Conducted by Japan</h3>
<p>Recently, under the pretext of searching for foreign intelligence agencies, the Japanese authorities suddenly arrested thirteen prominent British residents in Tokyo, Kobe, and other places. The scope of the same measures has been extended to the occupied areas of North China. Mr. Cox, the head of the Reuters Tokyo bureau, tragically died after falling from a building after being arrested. This is of course a very serious phenomenon between Britain and Japan. British public opinion is agitated, and the British government can no longer remain silent. However, it is reported that the Japanese side believes that the British protest has no basis and refuses to consider it.</p>
<p>It is not difficult to predict the future when the relationship between any two countries deteriorates to the point where similar phenomena are discovered. Espionage and counter-espionage are, in nature, organized, planned, and politically and militarily meaningful state actions, and often only exist between hostile countries. Spies are the hidden tentacles of a country, the sentinels disguised on the front lines. The home country must try its best to protect them, while the other side must do its best to prevent and eliminate them. Assuming that a genuine large-scale espionage case is discovered, it is tantamount to the beginning of two countries showing their true colors and engaging in close combat. At the same time, there is absolutely no possibility of recklessly engaging in public arrests without sufficient evidence, regardless of alarming the enemy, so as to hinder one's own counter-espionage work. International espionage cases will never happen unless in politically corrupt countries where police detectives run rampant; conversely, state-action-natured cases are an insult and provocation to the other party. From the two sides' accounts of the Tokyo and London authorities, although we can get a clear impression of the truth of the matter, we do not need to assert whether it is a case or not. However, whether it is a case or not, in short, it is either close combat or insult and provocation. In any other two countries, for policy, for honor, and even after estimating each other's strength, the inevitable trend of such deterioration can be immediately displayed; the only exception is today's England and Japan.</p>
<p>"Britain is on the wrong path," this newspaper has already elaborated on it yesterday. The British authorities' understanding of Japan is mostly outdated. They believe that at this critical juncture, they can no longer increase the number of enemies. They also believe that only concessions can exchange for Japan's goodwill neutrality. Furthermore, they believe that Britain's concession policy can help the moderate elements in Japan to raise their heads and prevent the extreme elements from acting recklessly. With such a view, although they know that this time the arrest of British residents in Tokyo is an insult to honor and a provocation to strength, whether they will endure the humiliation and whether they will retaliate depends on Britain re-evaluating everything about itself before they can understand. If Britain is like this, Japan is also on the wrong path.</p>
<p>Why is Japan also on the wrong path? The policy of the Japanese Yonai cabinet has of course disappeared with the resignation of the entire cabinet on the 16th of last month. It has been seventeen days so far, and who can know what the new Japanese policy actually entails? Konoe says a lot of big words, saying that he must quickly resolve the so-called China Incident, saying that diplomacy should not only cope, but also plan for the next thirty to fifty years, grasp the future, and create it automatically. Not to mention that from the publication of such fragmentary talks to the realization, I don't know how much possibility there is, I don't know how much time it will take. Even from the beginning of planning to start, there are still various different directions, different paths, different attitudes, different methods, and steps. If you say you don't care about everything and go your own way; then internally, you have to look at strength and spirit; externally, you have to look at the other party's reaction. For example, to resolve the China Incident, China is determined to defend its sovereignty and territory and will not succumb to aggression. For example, to strengthen the Germany-Italy-Japan axis, you have to see how Germany and Italy, halfway through the bloody battle, after winning a partial victory, will pay attention to Japan? For example, to squeeze out the rights and interests of Britain and France in the Far East, you have to see if Britain and France will bow their heads and retreat again and again? These future prospects have their various possibilities, but at least half of them are controlled by the other party, China, or Germany and Italy, or Britain and France, and not by Japan's own free control; could it be that Konoe has already foreseen everything, so he can grasp everything? If Konoe really knew everything and could do everything, then not only would he not have been silent for more than ten days since taking office; there would also be no measures to arrest British residents.</p>
<p>According to the unofficial announcement from the Japanese side regarding the so-called "inspection of various countries' intelligence agencies": Britain has a large-scale organization in Japan, which the Japanese call the "intelligence propaganda agency"; the work listed is: one, the propaganda outline lies in guiding Japan to be pro-British and anti-German, two, the propaganda target is Japanese elders, important ministers, and the upper echelons of society, as well as influential figures and backbones in the opinion circles, and three, the propaganda method is to distribute brochures, news, and films, etc. This is obviously the universal work of international propaganda in various countries, not so-called intelligence, let alone espionage. A crime in such "intelligence propaganda," and the arrested even committed suicide out of fear of punishment, is it not a strange thing? Therefore, it is speculated that the arrest of British residents is not entirely the case. Japan today has its aspired-to paradise, but its feet are deeply mired in the mud and there is no way to heaven. He hopes that Britain will bow its head and make concessions again and again, but he does not know how the British government and the public assess everything about Britain itself? He hopes that Germany and Italy will be willing to collude with him, but Germany and Italy are already triumphantly on the way to victory, how can they flirt to invite favor? The arrest of British residents is a double test for Britain and Germany. How many minutes the British side is agitated, it is impossible to know; and Berlin only coldly said to this matter: "It's not surprising, Britain has intelligence agencies in the capitals of European countries."</p>
<h3>Japanese Military Police in Tianjin and Beijing Interrogate Salvation Army Leaders, Enquiring in Detail about the Army's Activities in North China, Chinese Side in Beijing Closely Monitoring Foreign Nationals' Movements</h3>
<p>Tianjin – Yesterday, Japanese military police in Tianjin, Beijing, and Beidaihe interrogated senior members of the Salvation Army about the army's activities in North China. The Salvation Army did not report the actions of the Japanese military police to the British authorities. When the British Consul-General here met with reporters today about this matter, he was unwilling to make a public statement. When leaders of the Salvation Army in Beijing were invited to the headquarters of the military police to report on the various activities of the army, several plainclothes Japanese also went to the English concession residence of Ms. Huntington, an adjutant of the Salvation Army in Tianjin, and questioned her in detail. The Japanese who visited were very polite, and Ms. Huntington immediately provided all the information, maintaining a position of no concealment. In addition, there are five other British members of the Salvation Army (including three women), all residing in the English concession, as well as Major Walker, who is currently in Beidaihe, who have also been visited and questioned by the Japanese. According to the Beijing Chronicle, the Japanese military police also questioned 43 Chinese members of the Salvation Army in Tianjin and Dagu, but there is no news as to whether any of them have been detained or harassed.

<h3>Henri Haye Reappointed as French Ambassador to the United States</h3>
<p>Vichy – The position of French Ambassador to the United States has been reassumed by Henri Haye. He first traveled to the United States 32 years ago, and has visited the United States several times since then, so he is very familiar with the political situation there. In 1917, when the French government dispatched a military and diplomatic delegation to the United States, he was also a member of the delegation. In 1931, he accompanied former Prime Minister Laval (current Cabinet Coordinator) to the United States to meet with former President Hoover.

<h3>Negotiations on Opening the Pearl River Between Britain and Japan Said to Have Stalled, Japan Demands Sending Supervisors to the Hong Kong-Guangdong Border, British Ship Berwick Held by Japan</h3>
<p>Hong Kong – According to well-informed sources here last night, negotiations on opening the Pearl River for full commercial navigation have stalled at some point. The Japanese are adamant that those transporting goods on ships should belong to a "recognized association," but the British side claims that this would allow the Japanese to unfairly monopolize trade on the river, and also incite workers to launch anti-British movements. Well-informed sources say that the Japanese insistence that workers should belong to an association is because this measure can prevent smuggling. These people also believe that another point of contention is the Japanese insistence on sending supervisors to the border to prevent traffic between Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland. (United Press dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>Hong Kong – Authoritative sources have recently stated that as a result of the deadlock in the Pearl River opening negotiations, the Japanese authorities in Guangzhou have detained a British ship, the Berwick. (United Press dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>Hong Kong – It is expected that the relationship between Britain and Japan in South China will improve, as the reopening of the Pearl River will be implemented in a few days with the approval of Tokyo, and the commerce between Hong Kong and Guangdong will also be restored at the same time. British and Japanese consular authorities held negotiations in Guangzhou on restoring Pearl River navigation, and the results are said to be very satisfactory. Therefore, all restrictions on Pearl River navigation will be lifted, and Hong Kong is very interested in this matter. Since the partial destruction of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway and the occupation of the south of the Dongjiang River by the National Army, the Pearl River has been the only way for Hong Kong and Guangdong to trade. After the Pearl River is opened, some American goods can also enter the occupied areas of Guangdong Province via Guangzhou. Regardless of whether this move can be realized, since the outbreak of the "China Incident," the Japanese have never blockaded Hong Kong. Ships from all over the world, except for the Chinese side, can sail here. Since the fall of Guangzhou on October 21st two years ago, the Japanese Navy has never interfered with or obstructed ships. In short, goods from Hong Kong can be transported to the interior of Guangdong Province through several routes, and tungsten, tung oil, and bristles can also be transported to the United States through Hong Kong.

<h3>US House Passes Additional Defense Funds for "Two-Ocean Navy" and Equipment for Two Million Soldiers; Senate Amends Compulsory Military Training Bill</h3>
<p>Washington - The House of Representatives yesterday passed a bill to add $5 billion in defense spending to establish a "Two-Ocean Navy" and to equip an army of two million men. Observers say that the passage of this unprecedented plan with very few opponents is proof of the change in attitude of US legislators since the outbreak of the European war eleven months ago.

<p>Secretary of War Stimson Addresses Congress, Urges Attention to Army Strength</p>
<p>Washington - Secretary of War Stimson recently told the House Military Affairs Committee that the only way to deal with the general war situation is through compulsory military training. The volunteer system has repeatedly wasted money and failed. (Reuters dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>Washington - Secretary of War Stimson told the House Military Affairs Committee yesterday that the United States is now facing a possible enemy who could conquer Britain within thirty days. He said that this potential danger to the United States is "Hitler's direct invasion." When asked, "Assuming Germany occupies a certain country in South America, how long do you think it would take Germany to conquer South America?" Stimson replied, "Perhaps not as long as some people imagine." He said, "We are not yet truly at war, but the world around us is in flames. Japan's powerful fleet in the Pacific is controlled by a power allied with the Axis powers." He said it is possible that a certain foreign fleet could defeat Britain and that other countries possess shipbuilding capabilities "six times greater than ours." "Therefore, all of you here are entrusted by the nation and should pay attention to our country's army strength, which we will soon have to consider." He emphasized that the US Army, including the National Guard, currently numbers about 463,000 men, compared to the Netherlands' army of 560,000 and Belgium's 647,000. Colonel Stimson told the committee that if the United States removes its protection of the Philippines, it will give the islands a "bitter cup." He recalled his time as Governor-General of the Philippines and praised the islanders' loyal affection for the United States. "I know well that they support the United States." Although Filipinos are ardent advocates of independence (Stimson said this is only a claim to the island's autonomy), they should still rely on the protection of the United States.

<h3>Japanese Foreign Minister Advocates Accelerating Southern Advance Policy; German Activities Will Shift to the Far East; Crush Japanese Expansion Plan</h3>
<p>Tokyo - Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka explained Japan's new foreign policy to reporters today, saying that Japan will never shake hands with countries that refuse to cooperate.

Regarding the European war, Japan will adhere to a policy of non-involvement for the time being, but he declined to make any further comments on this matter. Matsuoka also said that Greater East Asia includes the South Seas region, without saying more. (Reuters dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>Tokyo - "Hochi Shimbun" reported that the new Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka advocates that Japan rapidly promote its southern advance policy and plans to establish a "South Seas Development Company," whose nature and activities will be similar to that of the South Manchuria Railway Company.

However, the newspaper believes that the Japanese government is firmly determined to "guarantee Japan's lifeline in the south." "Asahi Shimbun" reported that Britain's concern about the possibility of Japan joining the Axis powers on the eve of Germany's attack on Britain, and Britain's consultation with the United States regarding the impact of Japan's policy decisions on the Far Eastern situation, prompted the recent visit of the British Ambassador to Tokyo to Matsuoka. The newspaper further stated that the Japanese government has no need to notify Britain or any country regarding its future diplomatic path. The implementation of future concrete steps will clarify Japan's basic diplomatic policy and its adjustments. Britain's understanding of the true situation in the Far East is a necessary condition for improving British-Japanese relations.

Speaking at a luncheon to the Foreign Trade Department of the Pacific Trade Association, he said, "I think this is possible. Germany was originally a strong power in the Far East before the Great War. At this moment, it is possible for them to restrain or even shatter Japan's plans. German political logicians may think that since Germany has already occupied Holland and France, it should also have the right to control their colonies. When Germany enters the Far East in the posture of a colonial power, it will be the time for that country to strike at Japan. I believe that Germany's activities in South America will shift to the Far East because there is more hope of success there." (Associated Press dispatch, 1st)</p>

<h3>Britain to Decide on Policy Toward Japan; Monitoring Development of Arrest of Nationals; Two More Detained British Nationals Released; One US Reporter Also Interrogated by Japan</h3>
<p>London - The Times diplomatic correspondent commented today on the Japanese arrest of British nationals, saying that the British government is now closely monitoring all developments, as it will base its future policy toward Japan on them. London now feels that this move is politically motivated without any doubt. All of those arrested have been known in the past for their efforts to improve British-Japanese relations. The aspirations and hopes of these people have apparently angered the Japanese and extremist groups too much, who are more willing to believe the gossip of the many organized German National Socialists who are increasingly powerful in Japan today. This arrest seems to be aimed at overturning the friendly work that these people were trying to do, so Berlin is very pleased with the course of events, even more so than the many large factions that still hold power in Tokyo. The statements issued by the Japanese Ministry of the Army and the Ministry of Justice can hardly represent the entire opinion of the Japanese government that has been considered. For example, the phrase "calling Britain a hostile country" does not seem to have been passed by the Cabinet. However, the British must not therefore underestimate this statement, because it can show how the extremist groups now have the confidence to act independently, and what their power is. As for the British side, everyone now knows that the arrest and all the comments are completely unfounded. (Reuters dispatch, 1st)</p>

<h3>South Atlantic Second British-German Naval Battle; One German Ship Chased by British Cruiser; German Ship Escapes After Being Hit and Releasing Smoke Screen</h3>
<p>London - The Admiralty has announced that our auxiliary cruiser "Alcantara," which was converted from a merchant ship, recently engaged in a naval battle with a German warship in the South Atlantic. Since the outbreak of the European war last autumn, this is the second naval battle in the South Atlantic. This German ship was also converted from a merchant ship and had recently sailed to the South Atlantic, where it had successively attacked the British ships "King John" and "Davisian." After the rescued crew members returned to a certain port in our country a few days ago, they reported to the authorities. This German ship was flying the Swedish flag. Our naval authorities immediately sent the "Alcantara" to pursue and suppress it, and finally engaged in a naval battle. The German ship was hit by a shell, suffered heavy damage and escaped, releasing a smoke screen to cover it. However, our ship continued to pursue closely. Although it was hit by a shell from the German ship, killing two officers and soldiers and wounding seven, the material damage was minimal. It is still in pursuit. The first naval battle in the South Atlantic between British and German fleets was when three British cruisers engaged the German pocket battleship "Admiral Graf Spee" near Uruguay in December last year. As a result, the German ship was forced to scuttle itself. (Havas dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>London - The British auxiliary cruiser "Alcantara's" pursuit of an unidentified German warship is now taking place in the Pan-American neutral zone.

It is expected that the "Alcantara" will sail into the Rio de Janeiro shipyard for repairs because its bow was hit by a shell. (London dispatch, 1st)</p>
<h3>Italian Newspaper Reviews Strategy for Attacking Britain; Focused on War of Attrition</h3>
<p>Rome - The Italian newspaper "Il Giornale d'Italia" wrote yesterday that the war to attack Britain will not be the same as the campaign to attack France. The difference in the strategy for attacking Britain is not because Britain is an island nation, but because of the vastness of the British Empire. This campaign will focus on a war of attrition, to reduce the enemy's resistance, and must eliminate the military forces that assist Britain around the world. Germany and Italy have already decided to adopt this method. Currently, Germany is using systematic methods to disintegrate Britain's entire structure and isolate it from the outside world. As a result, Britain will inevitably lose most of its offensive and defensive capabilities. This will not only determine the outcome of the war, but also is a prerequisite for combat on British soil. Therefore, German dive bombers and torpedo boats are weakening Britain's resistance every day. Italy's task is to blockade the Mediterranean and attack the land and naval forces in various regions. The Italian military's attacks on the core of the British Empire also have a great impact on the political aspects. The increasing tension in British-Japanese relations and the rise of the Indian independence movement can all be seen as a result of Italian actions. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 1st)</p>
<h3>Severe Weather in Western Europe Hinders German Air Force Activity; Air Battle off Southeastern Coast of England Lasts Four Hours; British Destroyer HMS "Delight" Sunk</h3>
<p>Berlin. This afternoon, German military reports stated that yesterday's severe weather greatly hindered German Air Force operations. However, when German aircraft scouted the English Channel, several armed merchant ships were bombed. German aircraft attacked ports in southern England. Last night, above Dover, German Messerschmitt fighter planes engaged in fierce combat with British Spitfires. Five British planes were shot down, with no German losses. When British planes attacked Norwegian, Danish, and Dutch territories, three were shot down. Last night, British planes dropped bombs on northern and western Germany, destroying several houses and causing casualties, but no military installations or objectives were hit. In total, the enemy lost eight aircraft yesterday, while two German aircraft went missing. (One-day Huitong Telegraph)</p>
<p>Berlin. The German military headquarters yesterday issued a supplementary battle report, stating that the severe weather in Western Europe greatly hindered the offensive against England. Yesterday's main German action was reconnaissance flights, but attacks were still launched on military objectives in southern England. Since the end of the French campaign on June 26th, no large-scale military operations have been conducted, leading outsiders to believe that Germany is unwilling to proceed with the invasion of England. This is a grave misconception. In reality, the attack on England is proceeding fiercely. The victories of the German navy and air force after the Franco-German armistice, and the military headquarters' report from June 25th to July 31st, all prove this. During that period, Britain lost 370 aircraft and 936,000 tons of ships were sunk. In addition, 334,000 tons of British merchant ships were bombed by German aircraft. The above statistics do not include British warships and merchant ships that were heavily damaged or rendered unusable. (One-day Huitong Telegraph)</p>
<p>Rome. An editorial in an authoritative newspaper here stated that although an immediate attack on England may not commence, responsible Fascist authorities predict that once the weather is deemed favorable, Germany and Italy will launch a "decisive attack" on England. It is said that all methods of cooperation between Germany and Italy in the future effort to divide the British Empire have been arranged. However, Caida in the Italian Daily editorial stated that the Italian people need not expect a large-scale blitzkrieg against England at present. The Axis powers are waiting for an opportunity to launch a "strike and destroy" policy against British defenses and industry. According to well-informed sources, Italian land, sea, and air forces will attack British interests in the Mediterranean and launch a large-scale attack on England. (One-day International Telegraph)</p>
<p>London. An Air Ministry communique stated that on Tuesday, British Royal Air Force bombers spent the entire day attacking military targets in northern France and within Dutch territory. Aircraft fields at Ostend railway, Cherbourg and Boulogne, were all bombed. Coastal aircraft, while engaged in reconnaissance and escort duties, attacked coastal batteries in Norway and a supply ship north of Stavanger, and bombed the Emden naval base. One British aircraft went missing. Nighttime activity was reduced due to severe weather, but British aircraft still attacked oil refineries, warehouses, and aircraft fields in Hamburg and other locations. No British aircraft were lost. In July, at least 240 German aircraft were shot down by the British Air Force and ground defenses. At least 600 enemy air force officers and men were killed or captured. This number only includes confirmed destroyed enemy aircraft; many other enemy aircraft damaged in the air or on the ground are not included. Furthermore, the Air Ministry Information Department stated that on Tuesday, British aircraft launched a surprise attack on coastal targets from Vlissingen to Cherbourg. One British aircraft was attacked by several German fighter planes over the Vlissingen airfield. One of the German fighters was hit by the British aircraft's rear gunner, with smoke billowing from both wings as it crashed into the sea. Although the British bomber's engine was hit, it still safely flew back. Ships off Walcheren Island, the Saint-Colombu oil storage depot, and an airfield near Amiens were also bombed that day.

<h3>British Navy Sinks Greek Oil Tanker for Carrying Supplies to Italian Troops</h3>
<p>London. A naval communique stated that according to a report from the British Mediterranean Fleet Commander-in-Chief, the Greek oil tanker "Hermione," chartered by the Italian government and carrying 300 tons of gasoline and 200 tons of lubricating oil to supply Italian troops in the Dodecanese Islands, was intercepted by the British Navy in the Aegean Sea on the evening of Saturday. After confirming the ship's nature and cargo as contraband, a large squadron of Italian aircraft attacked. The British fleet was forced to order the captain and crew of the "Hermione" to abandon ship and then shelled and sank the vessel. The weather was clear. The Greek crew stated that they did not need assistance and sailed to nearby land in lifeboats. The Italian side greatly exaggerated this air raid, claiming that Italian aircraft engaged British warships and that several ships were hit and damaged. In reality, the British fleet suffered no damage, proving that the Italian claim of accurate British warship anti-aircraft fire was not an empty boast. (One-day Reuters Telegraph)</p>
<h3>British Aircraft Bomb Norwegian Defense Ship</h3>
<p>Oslo. Yesterday, a Norwegian armed coastal defense ship was bombed by British aircraft. The crew escaped in lifeboats.

It divides those enemy aliens who can be released into eighteen categories, which can be broadly classified into two levels: one, the disabled, elderly, and weak; and two, those with special qualifications and experience who can contribute to Britain. The exact number of releases is not yet known, but public opinion suggests that compared to the number of those detained, the number of releases will not be large. (One-day Reuters Telegraph)</p>
<h3>British Navy Sinks Two Italian Submarines; Gibraltar Attacked Again; Quiet on African Fronts</h3>
<p>Cairo. The British Air Force Headquarters announced this morning that Italian troop concentrations near Kaisala were heavily bombed by British aircraft in the past two days.

<h3>Balkan Entente Likely to Dissolve; Romanian Prime Minister Meets with Peasant Party Leader; Related to Future Romanian-Hungarian Negotiations</h3>
<p>Berlin. Dr. Mik尔 wrote an article in the "Berlin Financial Daily" yesterday, stating that dissolving the Balkan Entente should be the second objective of Germany's Balkan policy. The reasons for organizing the Balkan Entente at the time no longer exist. After the Salzburg and Rome meetings, a new policy has emerged. Romania has expressed its willingness to adhere to the policies of the Axis powers. The upcoming talks between Romania and Hungary and Bulgaria will likely announce the abandonment of the Entente organization and its policies. Yugoslavia and Greece will not want to avoid the consequences of this development. Turkey's situation is extremely difficult because its policies often support Western countries. After the dissolution of the Balkan Entente, Turkey must decide whether to adapt its policies to those of the Balkan countries or withdraw from Europe. (One-day Huitong Telegraph)</p>

In a speech to welcoming personnel, he stated that his impressions of the inspection of the various battlefields on the western front were very good. Everyone he came into contact with in Germany expressed goodwill towards him and the Bulgarian people. Cooperation between Germany and Bulgaria has been demonstrated by historical facts, and he believes that Bulgaria's wishes will soon be realized because Great Germany has achieved a position in world politics.

<p>Romania Considers Tax Reform</p>
<p>Bucharest. The Romanian Ministry of Finance is currently discussing a plan to convert the National Bank of Romania into a central bank. At the same time, it intends to lower the current tax system. It is also learned that Romania's military expenditures will be reduced in the near future, but the tax reform plan will not be implemented for the time being. The Romanian authorities now intend to wait and see how diplomatic politics evolve before deciding to take various measures.

<h3>Churchill Inspects Coastal Defenses</h3>
<p>London. Prime Minister Churchill yesterday unexpectedly visited northeastern England to inspect coastal batteries and fortifications. The former drove along the coast, frequently getting out of the car to inspect various sections of the defenses with great attention and engaging in warm conversations with officers. Churchill also gave a speech to workers along the way, stating that he did not know whether Hitler had missed his opportunity, but no matter what happened, Hitler's opportunity to drive straight in, which he had a few months ago, no longer existed. At that time, the wives and daughters of workers gathered at the gate of a factory. Moved by their warm welcome, the Prime Minister asked loudly, "Are we discouraged?" The workers' wives and daughters immediately replied loudly, "No!" (One-day Reuters Telegraph)</p>
<h3>Tangier Elects Administrative Chief; Spanish Minister Elected</h3>
<p>Tangier. Yesterday, the Legislative Assembly of the International Zone of Tangier unanimously elected Spanish Minister Dr. Miguel Yiva as the Administrative Chief of the zone. Since the establishment of the Tangier Parliament in 1923, Spain has had the right to nominate the Administrative Chief because the residents of the zone are mostly Spanish. France has repeatedly contested this right. (One-day Huitong Telegraph)</p>
<h3>Egypt Divided into Three Dangerous Zones</h3>
<p>Rome. According to the Ankara correspondent of the Labour Fascist News, the British military authorities in Egypt have announced three "dangerous zones". The first zone includes Alexandria, Cairo (where New Zealand and Indian troops are stationed), Hiyaksum (the base of the British Air Force), Port Said and Suez. The second zone includes 20 cities and villages, including Mansoura. The third zone includes places of less importance, such as Mingjia. This measure by the British military has aroused dissatisfaction among the locals, who have been fleeing in droves to other places. This exodus has added to the great difficulties in evacuating refugees from Cairo and Alexandria. The organization of the transportation of evacuated people is extremely inadequate, and many parents and children have been separated. The elderly, weak, and disabled are not being cared for. Police stations and city halls are crowded with hungry people pleading for assistance from the authorities, but due to the British measures, no prior notice was given, leaving the Egyptian authorities unprepared. As a result, anti-British sentiment among the people is intensifying. (One-day Huitong Telegraph)</p>
<h3>US Newspaper Advocates Mediating European War</h3>
<p>Washington. The "Saturday Evening Post" published an editorial advocating that the United States mediate the European war, stating that the current U.S. foreign policy will inevitably lead to participation in the war. The result of participation in the war will be international chaos and a fatal blow to the U.S. political system. Britain has absolutely no hope of victory. The war should be ended immediately so that Britain can avoid deeper suffering. All belligerent nations can stop fighting without damaging their national honor and prestige. The United States should clearly state to the British government that if Britain does not negotiate peace and insists on continuing the war, the United States will not participate in assisting Britain.

<h3>British Economic Warfare Department Issues New Order; Intensifying Naval Blockade</h3>
<p>London. The new cabinet order announced by Minister of Economic Warfare Dalton on Tuesday has been published and implemented at midnight. It stipulates that any vessel en route to or from any port that allows goods to pass through enemy territory without a valid naval permit is liable to confiscation. If the conditions stated in the naval permit are not complied with, the permit is no longer valid. From now on, all non-British vessels must obtain a British naval permit, otherwise they will not be able to enjoy the convenience of coal and water supplies in British ports. The purpose of this British move is to prevent neutral vessels from entering the blockade zone. (One-day Reuters Telegraph)</p>
<h3>German Newspaper Comments on British Blockade Measures Against Continental Europe</h3>
<p>Berlin. Regarding the British announcement of a blockade of Continental Europe, the newspapers here last night considered it to be "an attempt to blackmail Spain." Editorials in each newspaper solemnly pointed out that British blockade measures do not endanger Europe's supply of food and raw materials necessary for the war. The "Berlin Evening News" stated that the British blockade of all of Europe is to obstruct the normal development of areas around Gibraltar in order to maintain its position in the western Mediterranean. Since the failure of British Balkan policy and the loss of its position in the eastern Mediterranean, it has become necessary for Britain to maintain its position in the western Mediterranean. However, Britain will learn that neutral countries are now unwilling to tolerate British economic dictatorship. An editorial in the "German General Review" stated that the British Navy is no longer able to implement a blockade of the German-controlled coast because its warships are not sufficiently distributed to perform other tasks. The British government has therefore decided to withdraw warships from the dangerous areas of Europe and replace them with consular officials from neutral countries overseas to conduct its "blockade without war danger." Today, Britain's adoption of this measure directly indicates its inability to do anything. Because Britain cannot win simply by preventing transportation to Spain, it is an extremely obvious fact. In view of the repeated successes of German submarines, torpedo boats, and bombers in attacking British merchant ships, especially the approximately 300,000 tons of enemy cargo destroyed by Germany in recent days, which is the most prominent, Britain will suffer even greater blows. Britain speculates that blockading Continental Europe can cause famine on the Continent, but we dare to guarantee that those suffering famine will not be Continental Europe but the British Isles because Britain's position is now desperate.

<h3>The Consular Body Will Hold Another Meeting Today to Discuss Stopping Terrorist Acts, Authorizing the Bureau to Take Necessary Measures, and Requesting Foreign Defense Forces to Assist in Patrols, with a Resolution to Be Announced Immediately After Passing</h3>
<p>Following the repeated terrorist incidents within the Settlement, and in order to curb such political violence and maintain peace within the Settlement, Mr. Edward Fessenden, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC), sent a letter to the Consular Body on the 20th of last month, requesting cooperation in putting an end to these events. Mr. Hill, the Danish Consul-General and Dean of the Consular Corps, convened consuls from various countries stationed in Shanghai on the 25th of last month to discuss the matter. However, due to numerous constraints, the meeting, although lasting three hours, did not reach any agreement. Therefore, it was rescheduled for another meeting today. According to inquiries made to the SMC yesterday, the meeting will still be held in the SMC Board Room, and the time remains 3:30 PM. Furthermore, according to well-informed sources, consuls from various countries in this port all agreed to cooperate in maintaining peace within the Settlement and are actively planning various effective measures to prevent rioters from infiltrating the Settlement, especially regarding the defense of the western part of Shanghai. In addition to the Police Department making every effort, the foreign defense forces stationed in Shanghai have also decided to provide strong assistance. However, many believe that Japanese Consul-General Miura will still raise some issues during today's meeting.</p>
<p>Consulate Officials Remain Silent</p>
<p>According to the English-language "China Press", the Consular Body of this city will hold a second meeting tomorrow (the 2nd) in response to the appeal issued by Mr. Edward Fessenden, Chairman of the SMC, two weeks ago to curb terrorist activities in Shanghai. When reporters inquired with consulate officials stationed in Shanghai about this matter, they all remained silent. However, reliable sources say that when the Consular Body holds a meeting at 3:30 PM tomorrow afternoon in the SMC Board Room, it will reach a definite resolution.</p>
<p>Granting Special Privileges and Implementing Strict Measures</p>
<p>The steps to be taken by the consuls are to grant special privileges to the SMC so that the Police Department can strictly enforce curfews. Other suggestions, such as building barriers and blocking bad elements, are also expected to be approved by the Consular Body. Another anticipated step is to specifically request the foreign military commanders to assist the Shanghai Municipal Police in patrolling. According to reports, tomorrow's Consular Body meeting will be chaired by Mr. Hill, the Danish Consul-General and Acting Dean of the Consular Corps.</p>
<p>Resolution to Be Announced Immediately After Passing</p>
<p>Mr. Lange, Secretary of the Consular Body, stated to Western reporters after the last meeting, "The various issues discussed in this meeting are currently not intended to be made public. They will be announced after the actual resolution is passed next week." Therefore, after the various proposals are passed in today's meeting, they should be made public.</p>
<h3>Zhang Sixu Memorial Fund and Carlson's Will Have Exceeded 10,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>Since the assassination of Mr. Zhang Sixu, a director of the China Press, people from all walks of life, recognizing Zhang's commitment to justice during his lifetime and his dedication to his national and ethnic duties, have generously donated to create a memorial fund for Zhang. This fund has been decided to be transferred to the widow of Mr. Carlson, a Pole, as a consolation fund, as Mr. Carlson died at the same time as Zhang when he acted bravely in the face of the assassination. The fixed amount of the fund was originally 10,000 yuan, but it has now exceeded this amount. Although the fund committee has announced its closure, many donations continue to pour in. As of the day before yesterday, the total amount of the donation has reached 10,464.5 yuan.</p>
<h3>O'Malley's Candid Statement: Firm Belief in Legal Order, Unwilling to Participate in Political Activities, Opposing Terrorism and Assassination</h3>
<p>Yesterday, this newspaper, "Shen Bao", published extremely critical reports against Mr. O'Malley and Jiang Yiping, who were "expelled" and "wanted." A reporter from the Central News Agency visited Mr. O'Malley yesterday afternoon to inquire about his thoughts and views. According to him, he was not interested in the reports in "Shen Bao" and decided to ignore the expulsion order issued by Nanjing. He stated that he is a lawyer and is determined not to participate in political activities, as it was in the past, is now, and will be in the future. As for "Shen Bao", which he presides over, it will report truthfully and report the true situation of society to the citizens. It is definitely not a propaganda tool for any party. This policy will never change. Finally, Mr. O'Malley also issued a written statement: "I do not participate in politics. Even when I was nominated as a candidate for the Municipal Council, I clearly declared that I am not a politician, and I still stand by that. At that time, I stated that I am a firm believer in law and order, and that remains unchanged. I do not believe in terrorism, nor do I believe in assassination. No matter which political party or faction uses this method, it is inappropriate."</p>
<p>The Report in the Japanese Newspaper Is Not True</p>
<p>A paper in the Japanese-language "Continental News" on Wednesday (31st) stated that Mr. Edward Fessenden, Chairman of the SMC, is considering whether American director of the SMC, Mr. O'Malley, should continue to serve in his position. Mr. O'Malley himself declared that he believes this report is not true. When the reporter asked Mr. Fessenden about this, Mr. Fessenden declined to comment.</p>
<p>American Public Opinion Attaches Great Importance</p>
<p>Mr. Woodhead, a famous current affairs observer, commented on the terrorist incidents in Shanghai in the August issue of the "Far Eastern Review" monthly, believing that the current "wave of terror" is one of the most terrible consequences of the Sino-Japanese War. This bloody struggle, due to the constant activities of the "pro-Japanese" and "anti-Japanese" factions, each with its supporting background, is no longer a purely local issue. Since the "Shen Bao" bombing, the assassination of Zhang Sixu, the humiliation of Apong, and the news of the "expulsion" of six Americans spread to the United States, the American people have been greatly disturbed. American newspapers pointed out that these events are not accidental coincidences, so they cannot be regarded as the actions of an irresponsible criminal. The Japanese authorities clearly know that if incidents involving Americans continue to occur in the future, it will cause serious problems between the Japanese and American governments. In addition, British and American public opinion also expressed their dissatisfaction with anti-Japanese terrorist acts.</p>
<p>The Rumor of 87 People's Actions</p>
<p>According to the "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury," the "Shanghai Special Municipal Government" is said to have "ordered" a police station in the suburbs of Shanghai to assist the Nanjing "regime" in arresting 87 Chinese people in this port who are "wanted." The "crime" of these 87 people is obstructing the "peace movement." However, it is heard that the Nanjing "new regime" does not want to bring many of them to "justice," because some of them have recently expressed their withdrawal from political activities and do not participate in matters that are beneficial to the "new government." It is also known that when the "wanted list" was published, some of the people listed were not in Shanghai, and others had left Shanghai for other places after the "wanted list" was published. For example, Mr. Tao Leqin, secretary of the Chinese Ratepayers' Association in the Public Concession, is one of them.</p>
<h3>A Huge Bomb Was Found in the Machine Room of the "China Press"</h3>
<p>Fortunately, It Was Discovered Early and Did Not Explode, The Russian Constable on Duty Disappeared Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>The "China Press" at 264 Rue A. E. F., near the Catholic Church, is now in extraordinary times. The French Police Department has stationed an armored vehicle at the printing factory of the newspaper and sent Russian and Vietnamese detectives to provide protection in the surrounding area. In addition, a Russian constable, carrying a submachine gun, is stationed at the left corner of the church.</p>
<p>Has Been a While</p>
<p>At 5:30 yesterday morning, the Russian constable on duty at 264 Rue A. E. F. claimed that he wanted to go to the toilet, so he went to the toilet downstairs in the newspaper. Shortly afterwards, he watched the printing workers working next to the machine room of the newspaper for 20 minutes. The constable claimed that it was time for his shift change and went outside immediately. Unexpectedly, when the French constable who was supposed to take over arrived at the scene around 6:00, the Russian constable had already disappeared.</p>
<p>Has Disappeared</p>
<p>He immediately reported to the Xiaolan Police Department, which conducted a large-scale search, but to no avail. Unexpectedly, around 9:00, a hand grenade of about a foot long was suddenly found in the machine room of the newspaper. The discovery was made when workers continued to print the supplementary pages of the English-language "China Press." They suddenly discovered a package wrapped in</p>
<p>Stained With Oil</p>
<p>The workers intended to move it, but because the object was unusually heavy, they knew it must be a dangerous item. They reported it to the police, who sent officers to investigate. Inside the paper package was indeed a hand grenade, which was immediately removed and thoroughly investigated.</p>
<h3>Typhoon Enters the Sea, Customs Removes Signals</h3>
<p>After a Pacific typhoon passed over the Ryukyu Islands and moved rapidly towards Shanghai, it was only 110 nautical miles from Shanghai on the evening of the day before yesterday. Whirlwinds and rainstorms occurred in this port all day long. The Jianghai Customs specially hung two black balls on the roof of the Bund to warn ships to stop entering and leaving.</p>
<p>Passing Huadao Mountain</p>
<p>Between 3:30 and 4:00 before dawn yesterday morning, the center of the typhoon began to pass over Huadao Mountain outside the Wusongkou. The wind was strong in this port. At that time, there were eight gales in the Huangpu River. After the typhoon passed Huadao Mountain, the wind direction turned to north-northwest. At 6:00 yesterday morning, it had reached 32.5 degrees north latitude and 121 degrees east longitude. The center of the gale was within 60 nautical miles. According to the report, the typhoon has crossed the north of Shanghai and is only 80 nautical miles away from the Yellow Sea. The Jianghai Customs then removed one black ball at 9:00 yesterday morning.</p>
<p>Entering the Sea in the Afternoon</p>
<p>The observatory later reported at 2:00 PM that the typhoon had reached 34 degrees north latitude and 121 degrees east longitude, heading north-northwest. The gale had weakened. According to the report, the typhoon has reached the vicinity of Haizhou in the Yellow Sea and is continuing to move forward into the Yellow Sea. The distance is far away. The Jianghai Customs completely removed the black balls from 2:00 PM yesterday. At this point, the threat of the typhoon to this port has been completely lifted, and ships can enter and leave as usual.</p>
<p>Ships Resuming Navigation</p>
<p>The Taikoo Company's Haikou ship and Jardine Matheson's Guisheng and Yongsheng ships, which had not left the port due to the wind, left the port one after another yesterday afternoon. The Qingyuan and Chongqing ships, which were anchored at Wusongkou the day before yesterday, also set sail. Only the Da Xin Jiu of the Japanese-owned Toa Kaiun Company's Yangtze River line entered the port yesterday, arriving at 12:55 noon yesterday and docked at the Qiujiang Wharf. Jardine Matheson's Yusheng ship is coming to Shanghai from Haiphong and Hong Kong and is expected to arrive today, but the exact time is unknown.</p>
<h3>Never Give Up Police Power on Roads Outside the Settlement</h3>
<p>According to the English-language "China Press," a spokesman for the SMC recently told reporters that the joint police force composed of the SMC and the "Municipal Government" in the area of roads outside the Settlement was previously expected to be established within this month. In fact, the police force will not be established until Police Commissioner Major Bown returns to Shanghai in early September. Major Bown is currently on six weeks' leave in Weihaiwei and a police agreement can only be signed after he returns to Shanghai. The spokesman also said that the gradual reduction of Shanghai Municipal Police stationed in the area of roads outside the Settlement is not an indication that the SMC will abandon its position in that area. According to observers who claimed that the SMC may abandon its powers in the area of roads outside the Settlement in order to allow Shanghai to obtain a more satisfactory situation, the number of Concession police in the area of roads outside the Settlement has recently decreased, while the number of "Municipal Police" has increased, especially near Hongqiao and the Wujiaochang of Avenue Edward VII.</p>
<h3>Japanese Restrictions on Inland Trade, American Chamber of Commerce Takes Measures, Sends Letters to Members to Protest to the Consul General, So That It Can Be Forwarded to the US Government</h3>
<p>According to the "Continental Daily News," the American Chamber of Commerce in this city yesterday (31st) sent letters to its members, asking them to immediately protest to the US Consul General stationed in Shanghai against the Japanese restrictions on trade between Shanghai and the Chinese mainland, so that the US Consul can forward the protest to Washington. American merchants or firms who do not want to file a formal protest should report the impact of Japanese restrictions on their business to the US Consul, because these restrictions have made it impossible for American importers to transport their goods from Shanghai to the Chinese mainland. All American merchants whose trade has been subjected to any restrictions or obstructions that have been implemented or are about to be implemented should follow the above method. The American Chamber of Commerce also asked members to notify the US Consul of the progress of consultations or solutions obtained by directly consulting with "relevant parties" at any time.</p>
<h3>Japanese Inspectors Stationed at the Masnan Road Post Office Yesterday Morning, All Postal Inspection Procedures Have Been Completed, The Official Start Date of Postal Inspection Is Undetermined</h3>
<p>The Japanese are carrying out inspections of mail in the French Concession, sending personnel to arrange everything at the Masnan Road Post Office branch. They have been reviewing letters and consulting with postal workers about office procedures for several days, seemingly with the arrow already on the string and an inevitable outcome. The situation yesterday was as follows:</p>
<p>Situation of Stationing</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Weisheng, the assistant director of the Postal Administration Bureau, officially published the following points: (1) Director Jin of the Masnan Road branch sent a written notice to the General Bureau around 3:00 PM, stating that the general situation was the same as in the previous few days, so it cannot be considered that the inspection has officially started. There may have been instances of reviewing letters, but only when the inspectors arrive at the bureau at a set time to perform their work, just as with the complete format of inspections in the General Bureau, can it be considered that the inspection has officially started. (2) At 8:30 yesterday morning, seven Japanese inspectors, led by a Japanese person proficient in Chinese, went to the Masnan Road Post Office and met with Director Jin in his office. After presenting their credentials, the Japanese lined up and bowed three times to Director Jin and exchanged pleasantries for 15 minutes before leaving, completing the "official stationing" ceremony. It is heard that the seven Japanese personnel were dispatched by the Japanese Inspection Office of the Postal Administration and are directly under its control. Except for simply notifying Director Jin, they have the right to act freely in all their actions.</p>
<p>Reviewing Letters</p>
<p>Since the Postal Administration Bureau notified the Masnan Road branch of the various procedures for inspecting mail the day before yesterday, the branch immediately followed them one by one. For example, the receipt book signed by the Japanese inspectors after detaining mail has already been printed and given to the Japanese inspectors for use. The counter for "inter-district exchange of mail" has also been moved closer to the Japanese's desk for them to place mail into after inspection. All the mail inspection procedures have been completed after several days of rush work, but the walls and renovations of their office are still in progress and will not be completed in a few days. After completing the stationing ceremony, some of the Japanese inspectors immediately took up temporary desks, while others entered the mail room and reviewed the various letters waiting to be delivered, including regular, express, and registered mail, and frequently copied the names and addresses of the recipients with pens and paper, but stopped after less than an hour. Then, the group sat around chatting. None of the letters were cut open and inspected. The group left the bureau before 12:00. At around 1:00 PM, the seven Japanese inspectors went to the bureau again, and one more Japanese person wearing a handgun joined them, attracting much attention, but they left together after sitting idly for an hour and did not return until evening.</p>
<p>Registered Mail</p>
<p>In the past few days, the Japanese inspectors only flipped through ordinary mail in one corner of the regular mail section and never lingered in the registered and express mail sections. However, this was not the case yesterday. They reviewed express and registered mail one by one, intending to interfere. The branch director has also complied with the order to prepare a reception and registration book for both parties to register and sign when mail is detained, but no mail has been detained. The postal authorities do not acknowledge the mail inspection either. As for the bureau's telegraph transmissions, they have long been under Japanese inspection and there is no need for re-inspection. The rumor that it will also be inspected is not true. Mr. Chapline, the postal director, has completed his public duties in Chongqing and is scheduled to return to Shanghai on the Jardine Matheson's Yusheng ship this morning. The ship could have arrived yesterday, but was delayed by one day due to the typhoon.</p>
<h3>The Battle at Zhenhai Port Intensifies, Japanese Warships Fire to Attempt Landing, Chinese Artillery Pummels and Prevents Them</h3>
<p>The Ningbo Shanghai Associations yesterday received various reports from Zhenhai after its recovery. The telegraph reports are as follows: (1) At around 5:00 yesterday morning, two Japanese warships were cruising outside Zhenhai Port. One of them fired more than 30 shells at the fortress, but the shells all fell into the mud and caused no damage. Also, at 8:00 AM, the sound of artillery was heard outside Zhenhai Port, and the sound of artillery was also heard from Hengshan. (2) At 5:00 yesterday morning, three Japanese warships outside Zhenhai Port fired more than 60 shells at the Zhenhai fortress area. Our army immediately returned fire with artillery. The sound of artillery had not stopped when the telegram was sent. (3) At 3:30 AM the day before yesterday, a Japanese warship outside Zhenhai Port fired more than 30 shells aimlessly at our fortress area. The Japanese warship then released two small motorboats loaded with Japanese soldiers attempting to land in Jiangnan to test our defenses. Our army immediately fired artillery and machine guns, and the Japanese boats could not withstand the attack and fled back to the warship. (4) At 5:50 PM the day before yesterday, two Japanese warships sailed to the Hengshan waters. One of them sailed east from Qijiao. (5) Also, at around 7:00 AM the day before yesterday, a Japanese plane was discovered in the airspace over Shipu, flying from southeast to northeast. Ningbo immediately issued an emergency alert. The Japanese plane then flew over Cixi, Yin County, Fenghua, Ningbo, and out to sea. (6) At 25 minutes past yesterday morning, the sound of planes was heard in Longshan, and Ningbo immediately issued an air raid alert and an emergency alert. However, the number and direction of the plane were unknown. The alert was lifted at 8:56.</p>
<h3>A Bomb Was Discovered in Front of the Jardine Matheson Building, Fortunately, It Did Not Explode</h3>
<p>According to the English-language "China Press," at 8:00 AM one day (today), a unexploded hand grenade was found in front of the Jardine Matheson building at 27 The Bund by a Concession patrol. Part of the grenade was wrapped in Chinese newspapers. It is believed that the grenade was discarded by someone hiding it out of fear of a police search.</p>
<h3>The Second Batch of Evacuated Women and Children from Hong Kong Decided to Transport to Australia, Unremitting Wartime Preparations, Defense Measures Taken Step by Step</h3>
<p>Hong Kong continues to prepare for wartime without the slightest懈懈 slackening. The evacuation of the elderly, weak, women, and children continues. The second batch of women and children, chartered a large ship, is scheduled to be transported to Australia at the beginning of this month. This registration is still compulsory. Exemptions are granted only to those who meet the following qualifications: (1) Any woman who has no children in Hong Kong, or has a job in Hong Kong, or serves in various government agencies, and can obtain a certificate from the agency leader that the work is important and there is a real need to stay in Hong Kong; (2) Those who are preparing to leave Hong Kong immediately; (3) Those who have medical proof that they are currently unfit to travel. The authorities also stipulated that by the first half of August, the total number of evacuations, including the previous one, will reach 250,000 people. As for the Governor of Hong Kong, Sir Geoffrey Northcote, who left Hong Kong for a reason, the British government appointed Major General Noel Irwin to temporarily assume the duties of Governor. Irwin immediately issued an order to rectify all land, sea, and air defenses in Hong Kong upon taking office. As for the entire defense plan, it was formulated long ago by General Gammell, Commander-in-Chief of the British Forces in China. It can be decided as soon as Irwin takes office. The plan is purely a necessary measure for Britain in wartime. In addition, in preparation for wartime military use, pigeon registration is also implemented. Residents who raise pigeons must register in accordance with the regulations.</p>

<h3>Three Chinese Detectives of the Public Concession Were Arrested by the Japanese Military Police, Japanese Intervened When Detectives Captured a Thief, Guns Were Seized and Handcuffs Were Added</h3>
<p>According to the English-language "China Press" this evening (today), a robbery occurred at No. 609, Lane 541, Yuan Road, at 12:40 PM today. The Jing'an Temple Police Station received a report and immediately dispatched detectives to surround the house where the robbery occurred and arrest one of the armed robbers. The "Municipal Police" also assisted at the scene. Suddenly, several Japanese military police, led by an officer, arrived at the scene and ordered the public concession detectives to leave. Seeing that there were three Chinese detectives, each holding a handgun and wearing a steel wire vest, they ordered the Japanese military police to seize the guns of the three Chinese detectives and handcuff them, and then escorted the three detectives and the arrested robber away. However, according to reliable information obtained by this newspaper last night, the three arrested Chinese detectives were released and returned to the police station at 4:45 PM yesterday afternoon.</p>
<h3>After the Sudden Rise in Rice Prices, the Rice Industry's Attitude Was Judged by Outsiders, The Rice Sale Decision Was Temporarily Suspended for Ten Days</h3>
<p>The Fair Price Committee held a standing committee meeting yesterday, stating that the fair price sale had lasted for ten days as of the 4th of this month, and all rice shops selling at fair prices should be replaced. It was approved to suspend the fair price sale for ten days from the 4th of this month, and it was scheduled to continue from the 15th of this month. The rice merchants' tea party market recognized that the recent rise in rice prices was due to outsiders dominating the market. Therefore, in the future, representatives of the respective shops must submit their entry certificates when entering the market to do business, and all transactions must be completed on order forms, so that outsiders cannot intervene and the root cause can be eliminated.</p>
<h3>The Water and Electricity Labor Strike, The Bureau Is Watching Closely, The Industrial Section Does Not Decline Mediation, Staff Submit Four Guarantees</h3>
<p>After Mr. Yu Qiaqing took on the mediation of the labor strike at the British-owned Water and Electricity Company and the company put forward counter-demands, leading to a failure in negotiations, the Industrial Section of the Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC) expressed its willingness to mediate again. The Bureau is also paying close attention to this labor strike. If the stalemate continues, the Bureau will decide to take</p>
<p>Certain Steps</p>
<p>to eliminate this incident, which affects social order. According to Mr. Gu Bingyuan of the Industrial Section of the SMC, the insistence of both parties on their demands has led to a stalemate in this labor strike. Although I have tried my best to mediate, it has been ineffective. I now hope that both parties will come forward sincerely and apply for mediation, and I will certainly not decline to serve, so that this labor strike can be resolved as soon as possible. It was later learned from the reporter's inquiries yesterday afternoon that Mr. Gu Bingyuan had exchanged preliminary views with the staff of the company, but the content has not yet reached the stage of publication. In order for the outside world to understand their plight, the staff published</p>
<p>Written Opinion</p>
<p>as follows: "The following four guarantees are generated by the company's requirement for staff to guarantee that there will be no strike behavior in the future. Therefore, if the company abandons this guarantee to the staff, then the following four guarantees are not valid at all." (1) The company should be considerate of the current difficult times and implement the treatment methods for Chinese staff in the SMC or Shanghai Electric Power Company in 1940 for all Chinese staff. (2) Staff shall not be dismissed without reason. (3) Restore the personnel situation before the work-to-rule. (4) Wages during the work-to-rule period will be paid as usual. Accumulated events are willing to make up as much as possible outside of normal office hours.</p>
<h3>The Guiyang Red Cross Village Was Tragically Destroyed by Bombing, Fortunately, the Patients Were Evacuated, So There Were Very Few Casualties</h3>
<p>According to the "Continental Daily News," the Shanghai American Relief Agency (night of the 31st) received a delayed message stating that the hospital with 600 beds and the plastic surgery department in the Red Cross Village outside Guiyang City were bombed by the Japanese on July 28. On July 9, Japanese reconnaissance planes had visited the village and thoroughly reconnoitered the Chinese Medical Group and the Red Cross Hospital, apparently taking photos. After receiving news of the Japanese plane's reconnaissance, the relief agency in this city telegraphed the Guiyang authorities, requesting them to evacuate the patients in the hospital as soon as possible. Guiyang immediately complied, so when the village was finally bombed by Japanese planes on July 28, there were very few patients in the hospital and casualties were expected to be minimal. The houses and ambulances in the village were all painted with red crosses for protection. The Guiyang authorities now believe that this may be a faulty protection method.</p>

Mr. Yu Qiaqing and Mr. Wen Lanting unveiled the opening ceremony. First, Chairman Pei Yunqing delivered the opening speech. Mr. Yuan and Mr. Huang Yuzhai gave separate speeches, mainly stating that Shaoxing's various cities and counties are not rice-producing areas and rely entirely on the assistance of neighboring provinces and cities. Since the war, the source of supply has been interrupted, and merchants hoard, causing frequent rice price increases. Coupled with severe drought disasters, millions of refugees are crying out for food. Now, on behalf of the disaster victims, they hope that the kind people present will generously donate and jointly participate in this public undertaking. Afterward, the orchestra on stage played a sorrowful tune. Mr. Yu and Mr. Wen slowly unveiled the backdrop from the left and right sides, and there was a burst of applause. Photos were taken to commemorate the event. Regarding the entertainment fair held by the association, in addition to the women's Yue Opera grand performance on the first and second days, all ticket sales will be used to fund disaster relief in the seven counties of Shaoxing. The ticket sales on the third and fourth days will be entirely used to support the Shanghai-Shaoxing Relief Association in providing porridge, emergency relief, and purchasing medicine. The presidium of the association has already appointed Zhu Chengzhu, Wu Xingzhai, Xu Limin, Wu Rongqing, and others.</p>

<h3>Lawsuit over Estate of Hardware Merchant Qian Yiying Concludes, Court Awaits Judgment</h3>
<p>Qian Yiying, from Ningbo, co-owned a hardware store. He had a wife, Chen, but she had no children. So, he married a woman from the same town, Wang, as his second wife, and they had one son and two daughters. After Chen died, Qian had an affair with a woman named Ren at No. 14, Xin Yong'an Street in Shanghai. He died of illness last November 12th. His considerable estate fell into Ren's hands. Recently, Qian's second wife, Wang, filed a suit in the civil court, which ordered Ren to hand over the estate for distribution. However, Ren has not complied. Therefore, she hired lawyer Chen Wencan to file a complaint with the criminal division of the Second Special Court, accusing Ren and Wang Guixiang (accountant at Yudaheng Sugar Firm, No. 44, Xiaodongmen Road) and Qian Qigao (manager of Ruichang Hardware Store, No. 12, Xin Yong'an Street) of conspiring to embezzle Qian Yiying's estate. Judge Yuan from the court heard the case the other day. Both sides debated the issues of identity for a long time. Liu, in criminal accusations of embezzlement, each insisted on their own version. After questioning both sides in detail, the judge ordered them to debate and then announced the conclusion of the hearing, awaiting judgment.</p>
<h3>Hu Kaiwen Tang Yuanji Brush Shop Must Not Use the Word "Old" Again</h3>

<h3>Ministry of Education's Latest Measures to Maintain Academic and Cultural Institutions, Appropriates US$1 Million for Additional Facilities, Special Allowances for Teachers' Living Expenses</h3>
<p>(Chongqing Airlines News) Since the outbreak of the war, public opinion has been very concerned about the maintenance of academic and cultural institutions. Our reporter specially interviewed the person in charge of the Ministry of Education and asked about the latest measures taken by the Ministry to maintain academic and cultural work. According to him, since the war broke out, the losses suffered by various colleges, universities, and research institutions have been enormous. However, the government is determined to maintain them. Various public and private colleges, universities, research institutions, and academic groups have been relocated, reorganized, restored, or newly established. The current number has not decreased compared with the pre-war period. Among them, the number of national colleges and universities and the number of students have even increased. In addition, the construction fees for various colleges and universities under the education, youth, and culture expenses in the national budget were suspended after the outbreak of the war in 1937. Since 1938, the Ministry of Education has applied for and obtained approval to restore them, and they have been listed in recent years, which has helped to supplement books and instruments. Recently, the Ministry has also obtained approval from the Executive Yuan to allocate US$200,000 for various schools to supplement necessary equipment. The Academic Review Committee, in view of the serious shortage of equipment, has also resolved to request an additional allocation of US$800,000 to make a more sufficient supplement. This case is currently being handled by the Ministry. In addition, in order to remedy the lack of equipment, the Ministry of Education has also agreed with the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Transportation, and Military Administration on a method of factory-school cooperation. At present, each engineering college in the country has been designated to cooperate with one or several factories. As for the salaries of teachers in various colleges and universities, which were not high in the first place, were originally paid at a 70% discount. In addition, due to the high cost of living, it was difficult to maintain a living. The Ministry has applied for and obtained approval from the Executive Yuan to allocate additional funds to subsidize academic research supplies. For those schools located in areas with particularly high living expenses, special allowance measures have been separately formulated. Recently, due to the rising prices, the regular office expenses of various colleges and universities have been insufficient. The Ministry of Education has submitted a case to the Executive Yuan, requesting that the various office and consumable expenses of the schools be increased. As for the estimated budget for the 30th year, special increases have been made for office and academic research expenses to meet the necessary needs. The subsidy fees for various academic groups, which were suspended due to the war, have been restored since the last time. All these measures are to maintain the level of academic culture and stabilize the lives of academic workers.</p>

<h3>Finance: Hong Kong Sells Foreign Exchange</h3>
<p>In yesterday's foreign exchange market, HSBC's listed prices remained unchanged. In the black market for British and American currencies, prices continued to ease slightly due to the forceful selling by Hong Kong telegraph companies and speculators. However, foreign banks had a good appetite for purchases, and there were still rumors of bullish factors in the market. Therefore, the downward trend was very slow. In the afternoon, Chinese banks also bought, and American banks showed strong interest, with prices remaining stable. At the close, British gold was quoted at 3 pence 875, and the US dollar was at 5.96875 yuan, an increase of 0.03125 yuan compared to yesterday's close. The futures situation was similar to the spot market, with active trading in September contracts.</p>

Soon after, Hong Kong telegraph companies sold US dollars to foreign banks for the same month at 6.03125 yuan. The British pound was the strongest at 3 pence 875.

It is estimated that speculators bought US dollars for September at 5.90625 yuan. The midday close showed British gold at 3 pence 85937, and the US dollar at 5.96875 yuan, an increase of 0.03125 yuan for both the British pound and the US dollar compared to the morning opening.</p>

<h3>Gold Market Hovers, Fluctuating Around 5,400 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday's black market for spot gold continued its flat and weak trend. There were many sellers in the market, and buyers were relatively weak. Although there was a buying surge before the market closed, the closing price was still low due to retail investors selling back. The morning opening was 5,430 yuan, and immediately there were reports of a hardening foreign exchange market, and gold and currency exchange firms sold aggressively, causing a sharp drop to 5,330 yuan. Later, thanks to the support of currency exchange firms and securities firms, the midday close was 5,390 yuan. The afternoon opening was better, at 5,420 yuan, but currency exchange firms and gold firms came to sell again, causing a further drop to 5,390 yuan. Suddenly, gold firms, silver firms, and retail investors started buying, temporarily pushing the price up to 5,445 yuan. However, the high price easily triggered retail investors to sell back, and the closing price was only 5,405 yuan, a decrease of 10 yuan compared to the previous day's close. The total trading volume was approximately 2,800 taels. The price of gold ornaments in silver shops was once lowered, but then returned to the original level. The price of customs gold remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Spot Gold Drops Ten Yuan</p>
<p>From the morning, each bar (ten taels) was initially priced at 5,430 yuan due to a flat but weak exchange market and many sellers, slightly higher than the previous close by 15 yuan. Subsequently, gold firms, currency exchange firms, and silver firms competed to sell, and at that time, the exchange market was reported to be hardening, and there were surprisingly few buyers. Before long, it sharply fell by 100 yuan. Gold firms sold to securities firms for ten taels, retreating to 5,330 yuan. Then, a currency exchange firm agreed to cover its short position, and securities firms and retail investors followed suit, so it quickly rose back by 20 yuan. Gold firms bought from currency exchange firms for ten taels, rising to 5,350 yuan. After that, due to silver firms selling, it once again retreated to 5,340 yuan. Around 11:00 AM, currency exchange firms were actively buying, constantly searching for purchases, and the exchange market softened slightly, so the buying momentum gradually increased. By the time of the close, it had risen back by 50 yuan. Securities firms bought from gold firms for twenty taels, at 5,390 yuan. After the close, due to a rumor that a certain bank would issue banknotes, silver firms absorbed even more aggressively, raising the price to 5,410 yuan. The afternoon opening rose slightly. Initially, currency exchange firms bought from silver firms for fifty taels, at 5,420 yuan. Subsequently, gold firms and silver firms sold, stepping down slightly by 30 yuan. Silver firms traded with each other for twenty taels, at 5,390 yuan. Later, a certain silver firm suddenly developed a buying interest, and soon gold firms also followed suit, leaping up another 55 yuan. Silver firms bought from currency exchange firms for twenty taels, at 5,445 yuan. After entering, the buying momentum gradually dissipated, and currency exchange firms and short sellers sold in succession. By the time of the close, it had fallen back slightly by 40 yuan. Silver firms bought from other firms for ten taels, at 5,405 yuan, which was the evening closing price. As a result, it fell by 10 yuan compared to the previous day's close. The total fluctuation for the day was 115 yuan. The selling price of cash gold from gold firms was several dozen yuan higher than that of spot gold, and the buying price was reduced by 30 yuan. The current standard gold price was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price.</p>
<p>The Price of Gold Ornaments Tries to Fall But Stops</p>
<p>The initial selling price of gold ornaments per tael in silver shops was still 560 yuan in major shops. At 10:01 AM, it was lowered by 10 yuan. At 2:05 PM in the afternoon, it rose back by 10 yuan. As a result, major shops still charged 560 yuan. The prices of new shops were similar to the previous price, and the buying price was reduced by about 30 yuan.</p>
<h3>US Dollar Notes Fluctuate Irregularly</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw spot gold gradually stabilize, and the British pound and US gold pound also fluctuated slightly, ultimately falling slightly by five jiao. The supply and demand for British gold notes was still balanced, and the market price remained stable. The US gold note once retreated to 16 yuan 5 jiao and 1 fen. In the afternoon, it rose to 16 yuan 7 jiao and 5 fen, but then retreated again to 16 yuan 6 jiao and 7 fen, a decrease of 3 fen compared to the previous day. The demand for Hong Kong notes was weak, and the market price remained stable. Both Japanese gold notes and Korean notes turned to a downward trend, with the former retreating to 1 yuan 2 jiao and 6 fen and a half, and the latter falling to 1 yuan 0 jiao and 8 fen and a half.</p>
<h3>Securities: Category D Rises One Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the securities black market showed a turn for the better, but because the rise was relatively sharp, it caused many to close out positions and short sell, and the market fell back slightly in the afternoon. However, it was still firmer than the previous day. Based on the popularity and confidence of the various groups, the future is still more likely to rise than fall. However, there are many changes in the environment, and rumors rise and fall suddenly, so speculators are also exhausted. Only with drastic changes will there be huge rises and falls. Yesterday's trading saw the most activity in Categories A, C, and E, with Categories B and D being extremely rare. Buyers such as Tongji, Tongshun, Dingkang, Changkang, and Hu Heji all bought in, while Lianhe consistently sold off. Jiufeng, Zhongyi, Yongxiang, and Xieda also sold actively, and trading was quite active. Among them, there was a lot of trading that involved abandoning this for that, and switching positions. As a result of the competition, except for Category D, which rose the most by 1 yuan and 1 jiao because there was no trading open the afternoon before, the rest continued to rise by 5 fen to 3 jiao. The total transaction amount was estimated to be more than one million yuan. A brief table is listed below:</p>
<p>Stock trading: 50 shares of Guohua Bank were traded at a price of 55 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday's stock market continued to be lackluster, with few transactions and no price changes. Unless there is a definite change in the situation, either positive or negative, the market seems likely to remain stagnant within a narrow range and lack vitality. In the current situation, if prices fall, buyers will come to buy, and conversely, if there is a slight rising trend, sellers will come to sell in succession.</p>
<p>London, 31st (Wednesday) Telegram: Today's listed prices of Chinese foreign debt and Far East British companies' stocks only saw slight changes in bank stocks. Jardine Matheson Bank continued to rise by 3 shillings and 9 pence, priced at 7 pounds. HSBC Bank's London-registered shares fell by 3 pounds, priced at 65 pounds, and Hong Kong-registered shares fell by 2 pounds, priced at 68 pounds. The rest remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Bullish Cotton Yarn Still Has Not Given Up</h3>
<p>The yarn market has entered a flat and weak period again. This is because foreign exchange has risen back up, gold has trended downward, and actual sales are not strong, so confidence has weakened. The bulls, seeing the unfavorable environment, lack the energy to act, but most of them still have not given up. Therefore, the market is still soft with some firmness. Future changes will depend on the actual situation.</p>
<p>The spot yarn market opened this morning with a subdued atmosphere due to unchanged foreign exchange rates and a lack of new buyers in the market. The small opening price for 20-count Double Horse yarn was 980 yuan, a decrease of 6 yuan compared to the previous day. Then, it was heard that exchange rates had risen, actual sales were average, and short sellers closed out positions, falling straight to 970 yuan. However, a certain bull came to replenish the amount that had been sold off the day before, and the market showed improvement again, reaching 978 yuan. After the close, it was again weak. It is found that the transaction statistics for half a day were 1,380 bales, and the price of 20-count Double Horse yarn fell by 10 yuan. Yesterday, 90 pieces of yarn were shipped to Tianjin. The amount purchased by each group is listed separately on the left.</p>
<h3>Orders Not Yet Sold Out, Cotton Merchants Lack Purchasing Power</h3>
<p>There is still little new development in spot cotton trading. This is because the overseas American and Indian cotton markets are still stagnant and lack characteristics. In addition, domestic yarn sales are sluggish, and factories' interest has decreased. As for the industry, "they see that the actual situation is not working, and secondly, the goods ordered by various parties have not been sold out, so there is no new purchasing power." The price of fire machine grass bales is 149 yuan to 150 yuan, which is the price of delivery at the warehouse.</p>
<p>Another piece of news is the price of foreign cotton. The New York cotton market is very quiet. Initially, there was selling by the public, and then there was closing out of positions by some bulls. As a result, the closing price fell by 2-3 pounds compared to the previous day. The Indian cotton market also fell by one rupee yesterday along with forecasts.</p>
<p>The trading of foreign cotton in Shanghai is extremely quiet by all parties. There was no single transaction all day long. The industry believes that the market's inventory is not abundant.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Speculation Seeking Profit Suffers Losses: The Momentum is Exhausted and Difficult to Reverse, Tripping Over Oneself and Being in a Great Predicament</h3>
<p>It is worth reviewing the changing situation in the cotton yarn market over the past month.</p>
<p>(1) Since the collapse of the bulls last month, it has plummeted by several hundred yuan, with 20-count Double Horse yarn falling to 800 yuan.</p>
<p>(2) At the beginning of this month, the yarn industry, seeing that the decline was huge, thought it might be worth dragging in and going long again. Therefore, the market, which was on the verge of death, slowly recovered, and it was reported that shipments could be made to the Hua Nan area. However, the procedures for transferring and transporting goods from the Shayuchong port in the Dapeng Bay to the inland areas are extremely difficult. However, although Hong Kong groups made wholesale purchases, retail transactions were more active. Thus, those who seized the opportunity to move after a long period of inactivity started buying in large numbers. With this support, the yarn market regained the 1,000 yuan mark, reaching 1,062 yuan. Unexpectedly, the market price was high and the foundation was unstable. Those who were satisfied saw the trend and set sail, closing out their positions. On the 16th of this month, it was reported that the Japanese army had blockaded the sea entrances of Zhejiang and Fujian, and it plummeted by a huge 130-140 yuan in one day, breaking through the 900 yuan mark and reaching 885 yuan.</p>
<p>(4) The military situation in eastern Zhejiang improved, Zhenhai was recovered, and confidence was revived. The idea of raising prices was rekindled. It was found that the scope of operations was slightly wider. Factories opened several thousand bales of futures. On the one hand, they took in several hundred or thousands of lots of the 20-count Double Horse factory orders from retail investors in the market. For a time, the situation in the market suddenly became lively, and rumors arose, saying that the market was going to rise and that there was a big turnaround coming. The seedlings came, and because credit was loose, it was easier to obtain mortgages. It was as if a hurricane had risen again, and from 917 yuan, it rose straight to 990 yuan in two days. In general, it was thought that the 1,000 yuan mark could be crossed in the near future. Unexpectedly, although the market price was advancing step by step, there was still a lack of new buyers. Those who profited sold out, causing the market to rise and then fall by 20 yuan. In addition, there are still the following situations that hinder the future of the yarn market: (1) Speculators settling accounts in the first half of the year suffered large losses in seeking profit and were severely hit, weakening their strength. (2) Cotton yarn inventories are increasing daily, and production and consumption cannot be balanced. (3) After the Hua Nan international transportation line was blocked, it has now been changed to be transported to the inland areas through other ports. (4) The price difference from a certain yarn is too far, with the same yarn differing by 190 yuan. (5) The price of rice and firewood is expensive, let alone clothing, so cloth sales are even more sluggish, and small cloth factories are closing one after another. (6) As for the guest groups, due to transportation difficulties and high prices, they have simply given up and do not handle many orders. If they encounter a reasonable price, they are more willing to absorb, so there is no active and prosperous operation. (7) And the price of raw materials is flat. This year, the acreage of American cotton has increased, and there is hope for an increase in the production of new cotton.</p>
<p>Judging from the above actual situation, the current trend of yarn and cloth is that speculation, although deliberately trying to make it rise, is difficult.</p>
<p>Factories are unwilling to sell at low prices, and they are also unwilling to buy unless the price is at the lowest possible level, so they are all in a stalemate.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Guangdong Groups Buy a Thousand Bales of Coarse White</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw a softening of confidence and a return to looseness because the rumors about the East Indian incident, which had been spread the day before, were groundless. The association cut its price of spot 24 coarse white sugar by 67 yuan 8 jiao to 68 yuan, down 0.5 yuan at the local warehouse, and 67 yuan 6 jiao to 3 jiao in the morning and 67 yuan 6 jiao to 8 jiao in the afternoon, down 0.7 jiao at the outer warehouse. Transit goods, i.e. those with warehouse receipts, were 52 yuan to 52 yuan and 1 jiao, down 0.9 jiao, and 53 yuan for delivery on August 15th, down 1 yuan. Guangdong groups were the biggest buyers, buying a thousand bales. Dutch red for delivery of ships arriving on August 5th was 56 and a half yuan. Taikoo refined B-grade was 72 and a half yuan, down 1.5 yuan. The factory's snow white was 68 and a half yuan, down 0.5 jiao, No. 1 ice was 89 yuan, and Jingming ice was 90 yuan and a half, down 1 yuan each.</p>
<h3>Coal: White Coal Fines Revert to Original Price</h3>
<p>Since the new cargo of Hongji No. 2 white coal fines arrived, the trade has been tearing apart. Initially, the transshipment price was 110 yuan per ton. Subsequently, as the price of coal briquettes fell, it also followed the trend, falling by 14 yuan. Now it has returned to its original price, still opening at the old price of 110 yuan, limited to coal briquette factories. The market price is 111 yuan. Local door shops are 6 yuan and 2 jiao per load, it is said.</p>
<h3>Grain: Rice Prices Fall Back</h3>
<p>The spot foreign rice market, which had surged briefly the day before, fell back yesterday. The current accumulated stock is abundant, and the source is continuous. However, a large-scale manipulation would make the price high and difficult to handle. However, rice bombardment is still prevalent, and if there is a slight change in the future, speculation can be set up. It is good that the management of the rice market is empty talk, and it is rarely effective in the end. Therefore, if you want to stabilize rice prices, there is only one method of strict control. If it is entrusted to the hands of rice merchants, how can one not secretly protect each other? A ship with another 4,800 tons of Siamese rice will arrive in Shanghai by land and sea, and the spot foreign rice will immediately be reduced by 6-7 jiao to nearly 1 yuan. The original two-grade Saigon opened at 59 yuan and a half, down to 57 yuan and 7 jiao, and the two-grade Siamese rice opened from 55 yuan and a half, down to 58 yuan and 8 jiao, but the buyers are still watching. If there are no big buyers in the later market, the market will ultimately be in a downward trend. The total amount of original rice opened was only 175 tons, and the spot rice was no more than 4,000 bags. Yesterday, 328 bags of foreign rice were loaded onto the Yongsheng ship and transported to Yantai.</p>
<p>There were no new arrivals of japonica rice or glutinous rice from domestic rice, and trading was normal, and the selling price did not increase or decrease. The usual price of fresh clear japonica rice from Changzhou was 65-66 yuan, clear japonica rice from Wuxi was 65 yuan, high-quality japonica rice from Changzhou, Sixian, Suzhou, and Kunshan was 63-64 yuan, and secondary rice was 61 yuan. There was still no opening for thin rice. Southern port early rice was 59 yuan, and secondary rice was reduced to 57 yuan. The price of Jinli Baiyuan rice was 56-57 yuan, and special rice was 58 yuan. The price of Changzhou Danyang Baiyuan rice was 54-55 yuan, and special rice was 56-57 yuan. The price of Hong Kong Baiyuan rice was 55 yuan, and special rice was 56-57 yuan.</p>
<h3>Flour Price Stable</h3>
<p>The price of flour is stable and strong, because since the factory price was changed to 15 yuan, retail sales have increased even though there has been no large-scale destocking. The market is gradually stabilizing. Japanese-made flour has been devalued and fallen again and again, but because the cost is concerned, they insist on not selling, so the market has called the returned goods up to 14 yuan, and there has not been a large number of sales. There are few internal miscellaneous brands of flour, and in addition to the 6,000 bags of Huachang flour that were sold in batches, the trading volume of other miscellaneous flour was less than 3,000 bags.</p>
<p>The falling trend of wheat also subsided yesterday, because although there are arrivals in Zhabei and Hongkou, most of them are waiting for prices to sell. Japanese factories have repeatedly suppressed the lowest price to only around 18 yuan. Huachang's price is very small because the quantity transported into the concession is extremely small, and they are unwilling to overpay for purchases, so the market has been connected for several days. Yesterday, it was heard that the Japanese factory had a slightly greedy stomach, eating a disk of 18 yuan and 5 jiao, and Huachang received 2,000-3,000 bags, with a price of 20 yuan and 5 jiao, and the market gradually stabilized.</p>
<p>Today, a large amount of flour, a total of 30,000 bags, will be shipped to Fujian. The other day (31st), 2,000 bags were shipped from Hong Kong to Nanning by wheel. The flour was produced by the Australian Fu Yang company (Ancestry).</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains Market Narrow</h3>
<p>The trading of miscellaneous grains is quiet and lonely, but the sales market is narrow, and the development is weak, and there is no way for speculative means to start. It is because the market is flat and lacks characteristics, and as for the source, it has arrived one after another, so most of them temporarily reside in a state of more supply and less demand. However, the high-quality yellow summer is instead due to the firm market, while the medium and secondary goods are turning to a soft trend. Yesterday, a total of only 500 or more bags of Anqing beans were opened, with prices ranging from 28 yuan to 27 yuan and 2 jiao, 300 bags of green broad beans from Beigang Maojia City were opened, with prices ranging from 19 yuan to 18 yuan and 8 jiao, and 100 or more bags of Mingguang Mao mung beans were opened, with prices ranging from 19 yuan and 5 jiao. There were 2,500 pieces of bean cake shipped to Fujian.</p>
<h3>Seafood: A Batch of Yantai Tails Opened</h3>
<p>A recent batch of Yantai dried shrimp tails arrived and was opened yesterday. The top grade was priced at 272 yuan and the middle grade at 257 yuan. The market is still brisk.</p>
<h3>Textiles: Difficulties Piling Up - Small Weaving Mills Approaching Their End</h3>
<p>Since the sharp drop in yarn prices last month, many small weaving mills had already stocked up on 20-count yarn at prices of 1,500 to 1,600 yuan (some even at 1,700 yuan or more), higher-count yarn at over 700 yuan, and 12-count yarn at around 800 to 900 yuan. As for the high-priced finished products (cotton cloth orders) previously sold, customers, due to the plummeting cloth prices (with each bolt of coarse cloth or coarse twill falling by as much as ten yuan compared to the peak market price), the disruption of transportation in Vietnam, and the enforced blockade of the coasts of Fujian and Zhejiang, which halted the distribution of cotton cloth, were unwilling to prepare funds and take delivery of the goods (cotton cloth) at their own expense! Consequently, customers were resorting to simply abandoning their deposits (sacrificing the deposit, not taking delivery; because taking delivery would mean a greater loss than sacrificing one yuan or fifty cents per bolt as a deposit). On the other hand, yarn factories were urging the weaving mills to deliver the goods by a deadline, with extreme urgency! If delivery was delayed by more than a month, starting from August 10th, storage fees, insurance fees, and labor costs would be charged at 3 to 5 yuan per item. Weaving mills were caught in a painful squeeze from both sides. Recalculating their standard cost of 22 to 23 yuan per bolt (weighing ten pounds) (yarn cost around 16 yuan, plus 6 to 7 yuan for weaving costs), the market price? Was only around 20 yuan! (At the peak, it had reached over 30 yuan, with a net profit of at least 6 to 7 yuan per bolt). As a result, those operating at a loss and lacking sufficient capital were unable to sustain and immediately declared bankruptcy, leaving them with no choice but to close down. According to a survey of various weaving mills, large and small, in the city, there are approximately 300 in total, about half using electric power and half using wooden looms. The sales of their products were extremely brisk this spring, but after this major upheaval, more than ten have already been sold or transferred. And there are still 30 that are preparing to close down. Even yarn factories that own weaving mills or larger, well-funded weaving mills are reducing shifts and cutting back on labor. Those normally operating 1,000 looms are now reducing operations by one-third (i.e., reducing by more than 330 looms) or even two-thirds, or only running day shifts and stopping night shifts. If this unfavorable situation continues, there will inevitably come a day when all machines are completely shut down! (Island Guest)</p>
<h3>Sleeve Lining Fabric: Significant Transactions</h3>
<p>Horse mane sleeve lining (i.e., horse mane satin) has seen considerable transaction volume recently. Shops specializing in linings and large wholesale dealers of wool and woolen goods are all placing orders. Brokers running errands for Western-style clothing stores are also placing orders. The majority of colors are black. Hongsheng, Yinfeng, Daohua, Rentai, Datong, Baoxin, Baochang, Meixin, Zhenxin, and other factories are all producing it. It is said that Yinfeng Xinji is even busier because it can obtain transportation and sales licenses, allowing it to sell to other regions and export. Printed foreign cloth also has seen significant transactions. The quoted prices are mostly 30 to 40 cents cheaper than the current spot prices (and various factories are mostly keeping it secret, doing under-the-table deals).</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Cold-Storage Hunan Lotus Seeds Rise in Price</h3>
<p>Hunan lotus seeds previously reached 175 yuan on the market, but most of the local lotus seeds have entered cold storage warehouses, increasing costs. Therefore, recent market prices have tightened. Yesterday, the asking price from cold storage dealers was 200 yuan, a rise of more than 20 yuan.</p>

<h3>Old News Re-Copied: Sixty-Seven Years Ago (April 3) (See This Newspaper from the Twelfth Year of the Tongzhi Reign of the Qing Dynasty)</h3>
<p>Drawing Water into the Pond</p>
<p>In the garden of the Great Church in the British Concession, there is a pond, relied upon for emergencies. However, recently, due to prolonged drought, the pond water has gradually dried up. Therefore, four water-drawing machines were gathered, and last Friday evening, long leather belts were connected to draw water from the outer reaches of the Customs wharf to fill the pond. From 10:00 PM to 11:00 PM, everyone worked hard, but the pond water only increased by a little over three feet. This is because the leather belts were 135 zhang long, and the pressure had to be increased, causing the belts to rupture in places. Therefore, the operation will have to be suspended for a few days for repairs.</p>
<p>Picking Lotus Rhymes from Jian Lake</p>
<p>Red and green stand opposite each other, graceful; a single oar gently steers the light boat; passing through flowers until deep in the blossoms, playfully counting how many pairs of mandarin ducks roost. The Yue maiden is as beautiful as a flower, causing the flower to feel ashamed; a single leaf of the sand pear tree floats like a reflection in a mirror. How many times do I ask my companions if they have picked lotus flowers together? Gauze shirts and silk robes, but the morning dew has not yet dried in the new dawn; hidden among the flowers, still faintly visible, the green waves make one suspect a fairy has emerged. The varying reds and greens are hard to distinguish; dew gathers on the lotus leaves, resembling pearls; only because the silk robes worn are thin, the fragrance of the flowers easily permeates the skin. My home is by the Ruoye Creek, my youthful charm not yet developed; no wonder my slender wrists are mistaken for jade, and my soft hands are often compared to snow-white lotus roots. Smaller than a lotus flower are the delicate double petals of the water lily; try stepping on the lotus flowers, each step graceful; ever since Xi Shi picked lotus flowers, lotus boats have graced Jian Lake in May.</p>

<h3>Mistakenly Delivered Medicine</h3>
<p>— Qin Chang</p>
<p>When a person is unfortunate enough to fall ill and seeks medical treatment, their life can be said to be completely entrusted to the doctor. The article in this publication concerning "medicine dregs" mentioned that medicine dregs discarded at street corners allowed doctors to determine if previous prescriptions were in error. Nowadays, naturally, we no longer talk about such things, so the practice has become merely a routine formality.</p>
<p>Several years ago, pharmacies in various countries, competing for business, established medicine decoction services, which was truly a good way to benefit patients. For some serious illnesses, acquiring and decocting medicine oneself would take considerable time, which could delay the patient's treatment; and for employees of organizations, factories, etc., decocting medicine oneself is simply impossible. Therefore, medicine decoction services not only seek to develop their own business but also greatly benefit patients. However, yesterday's newspaper contained a news item about a mistakenly delivered medicine decoction that almost cost a patient their life.</p>
<p>The occurrence of such an error may be due to the carelessness of an employee, but the resulting consequences cannot be excused by mere carelessness. Originally, when one went to a pharmacy to acquire medicine, an employee would dispense the medicine according to the prescription, and another person would be responsible for checking it. If there were no errors, the prescription would be tied to the medicine package. Patients picking up medicine would also have a dispensing number as proof. Such scientific division of labor should ordinarily prevent errors. Medicine decoction services, of course, also have people specifically assigned to the task and distinguishing labels, because it is even more difficult to detect errors in the dispensed medicine once it has been decocted, let alone when it is mistakenly delivered.</p>
<p>After a patient entrusts their life to the doctor, they also entrust their life to the pharmacy. Therefore, to avoid such errors, every employee should, at all times and in all places, devote their full attention to their job, allowing no room for any negligent mistakes.</p>
<h3>The Borrowed Report Card</h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>The hot summer vacation is the busy time for schools to recruit new students; it is also the tensest season for a small number of students who try every means, even resorting to crime, in an attempt to achieve promotion or skipping grades.</p>
<p>This is a painful matter: yesterday afternoon, two of my third younger brother's classmates came to our house. They wanted to ask my third brother to borrow a report card from the previous semester (the second semester of the 28th academic year) because three of their friends, two having difficulty with promotion, wanted to change schools; one was preparing to skip to the first year of senior high school in the next semester but lacked the necessary supporting documents, so they wanted to borrow three report cards. They knew that my third brother's report cards were of no use to him and wanted to borrow them temporarily. I had always heard that a few schools in Shanghai were selling diplomas, but I did not expect that there was also such a thing as borrowing report cards! Driven by curiosity, I asked, "Wouldn't the name, year, month, and grade on the report card not match?" Then they told me: First, they borrow a report card from a classmate or friend at school with better grades, and then use precise methods to erase the name, year, month, and grade on the report card, and then use ink and handwriting that matches the report card to write the name of the applicant and the appropriate year, month, and grade. This way, they can apply to any grade they want to apply to. They added that the friend who was skipping grades could have used their own, but because their grades were poor and not good-looking, they also decided to borrow one. After they finished their explanation, I was thoroughly impressed by their "frank" attitude and "clever" methods. However, I was unwilling for my third brother to be drawn into the abyss of crime, so I immediately took it upon myself to refuse them apologetically. I predicted that they must have been very unhappy.</p>
<p>I watched the backs of the two educated individuals disappear, a blurred "?" flashing before my eyes.</p>
<p>Correction: In the dialogue below the illustration on the 28th, "Fly A: Hey! What are you always doing resting here? Fly B: Don't you know the cream here is really tasty!" The upper sentence is missing the word "this," and the lower sentence is missing the word "here." We hereby make this correction.</p>
<h3>Weeping, Returning to My Hometown</h3>
<p>This concerns students from the north. I hope the teachers in the education sector will pay attention.</p>
<p>Students in the north, especially in the cultural city of Beiping, are constantly hoping for an opportunity to come to the south to study, but economics and parental consent are always problems. As a result, those who come south usually come in small groups of a dozen or so people, and they are mostly graduates of universities and middle schools.</p>
<p>We and others came from the north this time with great hope. Although traveling south from Beiping is very dangerous, we still disguised ourselves as merchants or junior staff in various industries and secretly came. As a result, we finally arrived in Shanghai. Our goal, of course, was to take the university entrance exams. We first took the exam at Jiaotong University. The staff at Jiaotong University only said that there were problems with our certificates but allowed us to take the exam; however, other private universities refused to accept us, which not only extinguished our hopes but also made us feel resentful.</p>
<p>Now we ask the education sector, is admission based on qualifications (diplomas or certificates) and not on academic performance? Can't Chinese citizens who graduate from middle school enter Chinese universities? Do the teachers in the education sector in Shanghai not recognize students from the north as members of the Republic of China?</p>
<p>Now, we several classmates are returning to the north after our disappointment. From now on, there will definitely be few students coming south. China now needs young people. I believe this is a loss! (A Group of Students Who Came South from the Old Capital)</p>
<p>Hawthorn's Case</p>
<h3>The Ballerina's Fate</h3>
<p>— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Hawthorn put the key into his pocket and took out the small two-inch photo from his breast pocket to show me. It was Zhao Boxiong with a square jaw and angular features. I was stunned.</p>
<p>He said, "Turn it over and take a look." There seemed to be some impatience in his voice.</p>
<p>I quickly turned the photo over and, sure enough, there were five pencil-written characters: "Asia East 774." The writing was small and faint, and not very skillful.</p>
<p>Hawthorn said, "I guess these five characters were written by Wang Lilan."</p>
<p>"Then it's the Asia East Hotel?" I said, handing the photo back to Hawthorn.</p>
<p>Hawthorn nodded slightly and climbed back into the driver's seat, turning the car around and heading north. He suddenly asked me, "Are you carrying a gun?"</p>
<p>I was secretly startled, not expecting it to be so serious. I replied, "No. Are you?"</p>
<p>Hawthorn nodded, "I always carry one."</p>
<p>I also said, "Aren't we going to find Zhao Boxiong? Why would we need a gun? I find it a bit strange."</p>
<p>"It would be strange if we didn't need a gun to see Zhao Boxiong." He paused, letting the car turn eastward, and continued, "You must understand that since we still don't know who the murderer is—the person who shot Wang Lilan—we have to be prepared for any suspect to be able to fire at any time." He paused again, adding, "Not even Lu Jiansheng is an exception."</p>
<p>I thought this statement was somewhat abrupt again. "What? Not even Lu Jiansheng is an exception? Is he also a suspect?" Hawthorn's eyes were fixed on the center of the road. At this time, the car had entered the downtown area, and he had to be more careful while driving. Although I asked this impatient question, I felt a little embarrassed because it was really not appropriate to discuss such a difficult question with the driver at this time.</p>
<p>Hawthorn still replied calmly, "Who knows? I often tell you that when a scientist is engaged in research, he must not hold any preconceived notions. He must rely on a clear mind, keen observation, precise verification, and faithful collection of all materials that can be studied, and then he can draw a conclusion."</p>
<p>Strange, he actually started preaching. To be honest, since Lu Jiansheng was the one who made the accusation, he really didn't seem to have any motive to commit the murder. (63)</p>
<h3>New Women and Others</h3>
<p>— Chen Duanbo</p>
<p>"Silk Mill Sisters," "Tin Package Ladies," "Sock Factory Women"... Are these unusual names respectful or insulting?</p>
<p>In China's old society, new women were despised and abandoned. People generally thought that a woman who entered a factory was as base and frivolous as someone engaged in the flesh trade. As a result, in low-taste, lower-class mouths, Silk Mill Sisters were incorporated into obscene tunes; and female workers in cigarette factories were called Tin Package "Shells." These are things we can hear everywhere. When factories are about to sound the whistle for the end of work, we can often find vulgar people on the street joking, flirting, and stalking female workers.</p>
<p>A factory has at least a few dozen female workers, and the most are in silk mills and cigarette factories, with the smallest still having hundreds. Their hometowns are different, and their origins are different. There are women from families; there are those squeezed out of schools; and most are so-called "country girls" who have fled from impoverished rural areas in search of food; and there are even matchmakers, population traffickers whose intentions are not where they seem. Produced in this multitude of heterogeneous crowd, there arise what "ten flowers," "adoption," "ten sisters," etcetera of strange occurrences are produced. As a result, simplicity is transformed into extravagance, caution is turned into frivolity. This group of young people with weak wills entering society for the first time, externally subject to the seduction of libertines, internally tempted by small sisters and shameless workers, how can they not fall into traps and cause all kinds of tragedies?</p>
<p>Last year, I worked at the ×× cigarette factory and saw with my own eyes that the upper-class bosses and intellectual staff also debased their character and used vulgar means, and they, driven by the whip of life, dared not have the slightest resistance. This is a fact, a fact without a single word of fabrication. Although I have also seen a few female workers who invite the libertines on themselves.</p>
<p>It is truly admirable that a productive woman lives day and night in the sound of machines. These female workers are all suffering various traumas for the sake of a cruel life, earning a few pitiful pieces of bread for their survival. But why do most of the female workers wear heavy makeup, dress up flamboyantly? And why do they curl their naturally black hair, and replace a simple, sturdy blue cloth cheongsam with a colorful printed foreign cloth one? I really dare not write any further, I cannot bear to write any further!</p>
<h3>Believe It or Not</h3>
<p>— Ji</p>
<p>Trucks transporting rice will rent tank cars.</p>
<p>Rice shops are flocking to "Rice Robbery Insurance Companies" to insure against robberies.</p>
<p>Caterers' rice carriers are being modified to resemble heavy safes, slowly pushed along the streets.</p>
<p>Customers buying rice from rice shops, for purchases exceeding five dou, will be charged an "income grain" tax for the hungry populace according to the amount purchased.</p>
<p>Restaurants and hotels, depending on their size and level, will collect a "famine relief fund" from customers and set up a half-price canteen selling coarse food to the poor.</p>

<p>The Performing Arts World</p>
<h3>New Performers Coming South: Chronicle of Artistic Matters</h3>
<p>— Yu Chu</p>
<p>Golden Stage and Renewal Stage: After the expiration of Mao Shi’lai and Tan Fuying’s performance period, they may take a break for a few days during the summer heat and open again when it is cooler in the autumn. Golden Stage has already finalized Li Shengzao, Tong Zhiling, Gao Shenglin, and other performers. Renewal Stage originally planned to invite Sun Yukun, Song Dezhu, Wang Hongfu, and others to perform for a period, but now it has been changed to Wu Suqiu taking the stage first. Therefore, Sun Yukun and his troupe must wait until Wu finishes performing before taking over and performing for half a month. This time, Wu Suqiu comes to Shanghai, and it is said that she has already invited Chi Shigong to fill the role of elderly male performer in her troupe. There is talk of Yu Zhenfei playing the role of young male performer, and negotiations are currently underway.</p>
<p>Looking at these two troupes, there are two performers whom the people of Shanghai have not yet met and who are making their debut in Shanghai: one is Tong Zhiling, and the other is Chi Shigong. The author knows a little about the background and artistic affairs of these two performers and records them below as an introduction.</p>
<p>Tong Zhiling</p>
<p>She is a rising star among female performers, who has been performing in the famous theaters of Tianjin, such as Beiyang and New Central. Many people support her, and she is very popular in the Tianjin area. Her father is a scholar, who, due to his poor family situation, ordered his daughter to learn performing arts to make a living. At first, she had no fame, but after being introduced and becoming a disciple of Gou Huisheng, her fame greatly increased, and her artistic skills also advanced rapidly. Recently, she went to Ping to perform, which was highly praised by all walks of life there. She has already been squeezed into the ranks of the top performers in Beijing. Zhiling is skilled in both flower-shirt roles and sword-and-horse roles. Her appearance is beautiful, her demeanor is quite healthy, her stage presence is good, and her voice is sweet. It is a pity that she cannot reach high notes. She is known for her masterpieces of Xun school operas such as "Rainbow Pass," "Jade Hall Spring," and "Mu Kezhai," and she also excels at performing the "Spinning Cotton" opera, which is most popular with the people of Shanghai.</p>
<p>Chi Shigong</p>
<p>He is a fifth-generation disciple of the Fuyuncheng Society. During his time at the society, he was known as one of the three outstanding elderly male performers, along with Qi Shichang and Sha Shixin. He is the grandson of the old performer Chi Zijun (Chi Zijun followed Lao Tan for many years and was good at performing ugly old woman roles such as "Visiting Relatives," and is still alive). He comes from a family of performers. His artistic skills are characterized by stability, unlike the younger generation of performers nowadays, who like to learn the Ma school, taking its flamboyant and easy-to-please style, but inevitably tend to be glib, superficial, and not worth imitating. Therefore, I particularly appreciate Shigong's ability to prioritize rules. His voice is high and bright, but slightly lacking in grandeur. He has passed the stage of voice change. Seeing that Sha Shixin's arrival in Shanghai coincided with the end of his voice change, his voice was dull and dark, resulting in a disappointing return, he is confident this time and should not repeat Sha Shixin's mistakes. Therefore, I am confident that his voice must have recovered and reached a solid state. His acting style is quite experienced and stable, his eyes are delicate and expressive, his dialogue is clear, his intonation is distinct, and his stage presence is also good. It is a pity that he is not good at wearing a back-flag, which limits his repertoire. This is his only weakness. Chen Gong in "Arresting and Releasing" and Kongming in "Lost City, Empty City, Beheading Ma Su" are both his signature plays.</p>
<h3>To the Comedic World</h3>
<p>Comedic drama, since it was invented by Jiang Xiaoxiao (the late Wang Wuneng, chairman of the Comedic Guild), has been around for more than 20 years. In the past, it was very popular because it suited the tastes of the general public; but today, the number of comedic performers has sprung up like bamboo shoots after rain, which has created three dangerous phenomena for the comedic world itself. Out of love for the comedic world, the author frankly writes them below, hoping that the comedic world will pay more attention:</p>
<p>(1) Comedic drama is changing: Recently, most comedic performers only know to take the song lyrics, combine them with musical instruments, and sing them over and over like chanting scriptures, but they have neglected their main task—to make people burst out laughing; therefore, comedic performers have invisibly become small song singers, with name but without substance.</p>
<p>(2) Buying songs as singing material: A group of comedic performers do not use their brains and specialize in buying song lyrics without "jokes" and "meaning" from lyric writers, using them as their own song lyrics; therefore, people who like to listen are gradually disgusted and give up the desire to listen to comedic dramas.</p>
<p>(3) Stealing songs: There is also a group of people in the comedic world who, when they hear others singing a song, steal it and use it as their own singing material; therefore, if you can sing it, he can also sing it, making the general audience suffer from headaches.</p>
<p>The above three points are common phenomena in the comedic world recently. If they are not improved, they will inevitably gradually fall behind and be eliminated. I hope that all actors in the comedic world will be able to make improvements and open up a path to regeneration. This is not just the author's personal opinion, but those who love the comedic world also feel the same.</p>

<h3>Trends Among American Movie Fans</h3>
<p>— Tao</p>
<p>Not long ago, in order to understand the goals of movie fans, American filmmakers jointly held a voting-style film test to observe which type of film audiences liked the most. As a result, more than five million votes were collected, and after being categorized, it was discovered that movie fans loved comedies the most and hated crime films the most. The percentages of votes are recorded below:</p>
<p>Comedy — 32 percent.</p>
<p>Musical — 21 percent.</p>
<p>Ethical and literary film — 14 percent.</p>
<p>Historical and legendary film — 11 percent.</p>
<p>Tragedy — 9 percent.</p>
<p>War film — 7 percent.</p>
<p>Fantasy film — 4 percent.</p>
<p>Crime film — 2 percent.</p>
<h3>How Are Movies Made? (4)</h3>
<p>— De Gang</p>
<p>(5) Deceiving the Audience with Optical Illusions: There are countless optical illusions in movies that deceive the audience and make them believe they are real. Let's take a few interesting and frequently encountered examples: In many films, audiences often see a mentally ill person or a friend trying to commit suicide, with both hands and feet clinging to the walls of a skyscraper, gradually climbing upwards, making people sweat with anxiety. When they reach the top, they even jump to the roof of the neighboring building. If they are not careful, they will definitely fall to their deaths. These dangerous and amazing stunts, when exposed, are not worth a penny. The original method is to pre-lay a set on the floor of the photography studio that resembles the walls of a tall building, and then ask the actor to crawl on the ground. The camera is placed on a very high ladder, and the photographer points the lens down at the ground, aiming at the actor to shoot. When the film is screened, it looks as if the real actor is climbing a high wall.</p>
<p>There is also an interesting technique for deceiving the audience, which is actors performing swimming (sometimes real) or drowning scenes. For example, performing drowning is extremely simple: the actor lies face up on the ground, moving both hands and feet in the air, pretending to struggle. The camera is placed very high, and the lens points downwards. A glass basin of water is placed in the empty space between the lens and the actor's body. The actor's movements are reflected through the water and captured in the film, which looks completely real. It is a very clever technique.</p>
<h3>Listening to Sounds</h3>
<p>Zhang Xinqi said, "In spring, listen to the sound of birds; in summer, listen to the sound of cicadas; in autumn, listen to the sound of insects; in winter, listen to the sound of snow; during the day, listen to the sound of chess; under the moon, listen to the sound of the flute; in the mountains, listen to the sound of pine trees; by the water, listen to the sound of oars; only then will this life not be in vain. If there are the scolding and insults of young hooligans and shrewish wives, it is better to be deaf." Wang Mingyou said, "The sound of pine waves, the sound of waterfalls, the sound of flutes, the sound of tides, the sound of reading, the sound of bells, the sound of chanting are all suitable for listening from afar; only the sound of the qin, the sound of songs, the sound of snow cannot fully capture their nuances of separation, combination, rising, and falling unless listened to closely. I remember five or six years ago, on a summer night, boating on West Lake, the moonlight was hazy, the cool breeze was gentle, the boat was filled with melons and fruits, and Lan Xun played the flute. I ordered my female disciple, Man Sheng, to sing selections from The Peony Pavilion and The Jade Hairpin, etc. As the boat traveled along the shore, the lights on the buildings shone brightly, and the people on the buildings must have heard the sound, didn't they? I wonder if the two gentlemen, Zhang and Wang, would also enjoy listening to this sound? In general, although sound can be listened to, it must be accompanied by suitable scenery. Today, when listening to opera, one must look up to people to buy tickets, and then be squeezed in a crowd of smelly sweat, even if there is good sound, one lacks the elegant interest. Perhaps it is because the houses are narrow and the people are numerous in Shanghai, and one is confined to a small room, so it is better to be squeezed in the square, and there is also the pleasure of sound and color. However, I still hope that the theater owners can improve the three things: publicizing ticket sales, the attitude of the ticket sellers, and adding seats."</p>
