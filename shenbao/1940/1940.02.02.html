<h3>英國之自尊心與外交風度</h3>
<p>各國外交之相侔，非惟其政策，標的，方式，運用之互殊而巳，更因時而殊，因勢而殊；復各有其風度，風度之形成，由文化，由國民性，由先天傳統，故自始而殊。蘇聯前外長李維諾夫氏所持者殊不類蘇聯之風度，故雖望重一時而終未能暢其志；英法以與李維諾夫氏相周旋者，與莫洛托夫氏相周旋，遂致格格不相入而盡失機宜。日本以美國風度之溫和，遂視之爲政策苟且，標的遊移，方式迂闊，運用拙滯；及美國宣告廢止商約，日本始爲之色變；及宣告期滿之最後一霎那，美國猶無商訂臨時辦法之意響，日本始之爲氣沮。此二事者，皆由其當局疏於識別對方外交風度而誤入歧途者也。茲作是說，僅以證實風度之殊，所關極大；而世之從事外交乃至觀察外交者，尤有識別各國風度之必要。至於如何斯爲各國風度之特徵，則或明或晦或矛盾而並存；雖不曰神秘，卻甚是微妙，未易體認，更難說明。猶言某國之文化如何，國民性如何，亦難遽得其簡明而確切之輪廓也。</p>
<p>當前之國際，甚多問題之前途，英國實爲決定之重要因素；而當前之時勢之下，追求英國外交之整個體態，困難特甚；夫豈不曰覆按彼首相外相之所云云可也，顧彼首相外相又豈得而盡言之？例如英國對捷克與波蘭，對中國與芬蘭，對日本與德國暨蘇聯，其言辭，其行動，其所宣示取爲根據之原則，參差不一；幾乎不類同一國，同一時代，同一首相外相之所作爲。雖然，十百年之後，研求今日之史實，安知不能恍然於今日凡百參差，固絲毫踰於英國傳統之風度哉？</p>
<p>隔昨，即一月三十一日，英國首相張伯倫氏在「公衆利益保障委員會」作外交演說，涉及英日兩國間之淺間丸案，其言曰：</p>
<p>「就純粹國際法觀點而論，彼此兩國政府容或作不同的解釋，但民族之生命與人類的心理，要非以法理問題爲最強有力的因素，日本人民或日本政府倘若以爲吾國故意任便行使交戰國權利，對於國際禮貌暨日本民族一概置之不顧，則事之足使吾人惆悵者，莫比爲甚，須知吾國之強敵毫無顧忌，吾人爲打消其謀畫起見，對於各種所行之事，不得不予以實施，特吾人願與友邦和平相處，決不願採取何項措置，以干犯此一友邦之自尊心也」</p>
<p>如淺間丸案者，誠所謂小事，吾人自樂聞小事之化無；然如所謂「民族生命與人類心理，要非以法理問題爲最強有力之因素」，則不但予以以「張伯倫心理叵測」之感，且將致疑於英國外交與國際糾紛，因將以何者爲遵循之因素？又如所謂英國「決不願採取何種措置，以干犯此一友幫之自尊心」，洵爲仁厚而合理之態度，吾人殷願國際能普遍採納此種態度。即如日本而能不干犯中國之自尊心，德國而能不干犯捷波諸國之自尊心，則「天下本無事」矣；此在干犯他國自尊心如國社主義者，吾人當爲張伯倫氏辯護曰，彼既無權根據自尊心而要求英國放棄其摧毀國社主義與國社政制之作戰目標；然吾人不能不希望張伯倫氏發動其自尊心而採取何種措施，以發揮英國在遠東關於條約與公道之自尊心；並爲自尊心而有所措施，自行恢復其在遠東所被干犯之。吾人固深信在華之一般英僑，尤如天津英僑，皆能保質其傳統之自尊心者也。</p>
<p>「見微知者」，「舉一反三」，不適用於英國外交風度下之英國整個外交體態；不然，張伯倫氏隔昨所語於淺間丸案者，將使同情於英國之世界人士，保留其對英之同情，而代之以疑訝。蓋英國作風，凡語於此案者，祇關此案，不涉其他。故關於淺間丸案者，英國之對日態度如此；關於中日問題者，同日由外務次官勃特勒氏在下議院重言以聲明英國之態度曰：「英國政府於去年一月十四日，以照會送達日本政府時，業巳剴切說明，仍欲信守華府九國公約各項原則，此種態度，迄未變更」，是則無所疑訝，抑且至可欣慰。原風度之形成，由文化，由國民性，由先天傳統，故關風度者，不容期以修正或轉變；英國風度之有時而使人疑訝，固無損於英國最後措施之明朗果斷；而英國爲具有自尊心之民族，尤可爲其風度與明朗果斷之措施，作可珍之保證者也。</p>
<h3>美參字外委會審查　遠東實施中立法案　即將審查對日禁運各案　傳美政府考慮貸款中國</h3>
<p>華盛頓　參議院外交委員會本日推選若干委員、組織小組委員會、而以民主黨參議員喬治爲主席、以審查共和黨參議員即孤立派要人季賫德所提出之法案、其內容主張宣佈中日兩國間巳成立之戰爭狀態、從而對於中日兩國實施現行中立法、據外交委員會主席畢德門於會後向報界談稱、余所提出之法案、即主張對日實施禁運辦法者、當俟外交委員會對於季賫德提案決定態度之後、始乃提付討論、（三十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　據外交委員會主席畢德門聲稱、當禁運法案提出討論時、渠將請國務院官員代表政府出席、民主黨參議員納斯及共和黨參議員強生、被任爲小組委員會委員、考慮民主黨參議吉利特所提在遠東實施中立法之方案、聞對日實施禁運法案不擬交付小組委員會審查、所有提案、將由外交委員會全體委員審查之、愈速愈妙、消息靈通人士臆斷、外交委員會將開始慎重檢討日本局勢、該會欲採取堅決而又謹慎之辦法、以對付日本、國會方面盛傳、政府爲應付日本局勢計，將由美國進出口銀行貸款予華作爲間接之壓迫、但該項辦法、尚未列入外交委員會討論範圍之內、（一日合衆電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　日駐美大使　內三十一日下午四時半訪問美國國務卿赫爾、關於調整無條約情形下日美關係問題交換意見、（三十一日同盟電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　經外交界人士對於美日兩國間現行困難成立解決辦法一屋、所懷希望頗爲淡薄、據國會人士所知、美日現行談判、倘不能獲致滿意解決方案、則美國政府即當要求國會界以必要權力、俾克對日推行強硬政策、（一日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>日各政黨力謀　恢復政治生命　對陸軍跋扈始終不滿</h3>
<p>東京　日本第七十五屆國會、頃於本日復會、一般觀察家咸謂阿部前內閣此時若猶存在、而出席衆議院、必如航海之遭遇大風浪、此在米內內閣、則處境較爲順利、風浪可望較爲平靜、惟各政黨被迫而處於政治舞臺之幕後者、將近十年、此决阿部內閣之傾覆、各政黨旣與有力焉、自必設法證明其已重復參加日本政治生命、職是之故、在衆議院開會後、若干星期內、各黨議員必多率直之表示、殆可斷言、以</p>
<p>民政黨</p>
<p>而論、該黨因有代表二人入閣、頃已決定公開贊助米內內閣、但據朝日新聞載稱、民政黨一般黨員、對於國防各部門與政府間關係現狀感覺不滿、因而對於現內閣、遂亦趨於冷淡、又以</p>
<p>政友會</p>
<p>而論、內部雖已分爲兩派、但一致承認須待米內內閣有所作爲之後、乃可加以判斷、並決定贊助與吾、兩派若干份子、且認爲米內內閣傾向於「墨守現狀、」與阿部前內閣、乃屬一邱之貉、至以各小政黨而論、進行「維新」主義的宣傳運動、頗爲積極、往往公開批評溫和派的內閣、是以各該黨黨員雖少、其態度亦殊値得注意、其中</p>

<h3>為春禮券軍運動　節約會告各界書</h3>

<p>他們沒有除夕</p>
<p>「一年容易、又是歲暮時節、孤島人士、正忙着預備節禮、餽贈親友、或購辦年貨、準備消度春節、在這個抗戰的大時代中、我們還生存着、還能够有機會過年、眞是時代中的幸運兒、可是爲着國家的獨立、民族的生存、正有無數英男的將士、離開了家鄕、在戰塲上、冒着冰雪·勁風、爲着視國殺敵、他們沒有除夕、也沒有春節、這種艱苦卓絕的生活、同我們比較起來、其問的苦樂、眞不可以道里計呢、現在全國慰勞將士委員會總會有鑒於此、特發起春禮勞軍運動、提倡將春節禮品移轉餽贈對象、全國各地都已熱烈響應、本市方面亦經集商決定、於一日起開始推行、並以籌募代金五上萬元爲目的、這是我們後方同胞對於在冰天雪地中浴血抗戰的將士、應當有的一種最低限度的表示、也是每個人應該所盡的國民天職、</p>
<p>祇要稍加節目</p>
<p>現在春節將很快的來臨了、如果我們三百萬的上海市民、每人能减少一分錢的年節消耗、就有三萬塊錢、然而平均起來、一個人何止一分呢、倘然第人能節消耗一角、就集成三十萬元、少用一元、就有三百萬元所以五十萬元的慰勞代金、實在算不了什麼、同胞們、我們祇要稍微節省一下、對於國家、就有絕大的帮助、在艱苦的大時代中、我們已經是比較幸運、如果减少一些、或是完全省下年節的消耗、當然是不算一件難事、爲了自己的國家、爲了前方的將士、希望大家踴躍輸將、共襄義舉吧、」</p>

<p>新聲社記者、昨向關係方面探悉、滬市昨日已接到紹興發來電報云、「紹城安謐、自紹興至龕山及臨浦、電話均已通達、龕山臨浦兩地確無日跡、則足證龕山等地已吿收複、紹興安謐、外傳謠言不可靠、</p>

<p>勸募目的</p>
<p>此次勸慕運動、希望能慕足六萬元、莫氏昨午特在扶輪社招待各界、到有該軍顧問軍官及其眷屬多人、席間由扶輪社社長吳而夫氏主席、大將麥乃敦·隊長莫利氏·哈利氏·等、均有動人演說、</p>

<h3>總結束期間　平糶暫停　續訂碎米定期到滬　集團訂購二萬餘包</h3>
<p>上海平糶委員會積極勸募捐款辦理平糶後、第一次向上海市塲上購進之二萬零零六十八包、業已完全糶罄、向西貢訂購之一萬五千包、分三批抵滬後、今決啣接辦理平糶、惟在各業總結束期內、擬暫停平糶、因承糶之各米號辦理總結束故也、至於第二次向上海市塲購進之五千包、現堆在銀行堆棧內、續訂之一萬一千包、已接電吿、的十日可抵滬、</p>

<p>外報觀察貢米價格</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、本市米價、仍甚昂貴、商界繼續自西貢運米入口、米荒始免、六星期前、日軍發言人招待新聞記者時所發日軍憐惜貧苦華人、擬運米入滬、以解其荒之諾言、迄未實現、至於西貢米、則因匯率續跌、與已往兩月內運貨高漲半倍、故運抵上海、其價殊昂、惟商人仍不斷採購、西貢米之零售價格、因視匯率與運費而定、故工部局不能加以限止、</p>

<h3>中西探捕二三百名　昨夜與劇盜鏖戰　山西路永大棉號被刦　劇盜拒捕互轟數百響　格斃兩盜生擒五人西捕頭受重傷</h3>
<p>昨晚七時許、公共租界山西路種德里十四號永大棉花號、突被兇悍盜黨十餘人、持盒子砲侵入、意圖威嚇行刦、在租界探警防衛森嚴、而該處又爲熱鬧區域、盜黨竟敢出此、殊爲近年來本埠盜刦案中未有之重大案件、嗣經捕房方面立即出動探警二三百人、四週圍捕、經數小時之搜捕、計擊斃盗匪兩名、生擒五盜、中西探捕亦有受傷者、一時山西路上、如臨大敵、形勢頗爲緊張、直至今晨三時餘、數百中西探捕、猶在嚴密包圍搜索中、茲將各情分誌于下、</p>
<p>劇盜行刦永大棉號</p>
<p>永大花號係湖北人張子裕所開設、近年經營頗稱順利、盜黨因聞張氏長袖善舞、積資不少、遂起歹念、當昨晚七時、山西路上正値萬頭攢動之際、忽有盜黨十餘人、先後於人叢中潛入種德里、該里位於寗波路北京路之間、永大棉花號即在該里進弄第一家、其大門係石庫門、平時尙有相當戒備、昨晚盜黨潛入、人數旣衆、又多持有武器、以致被其先後衝入該里、</p>
<p>警車六輛嚴密圍捕</p>
<p>盜黨旣抵該號、職員見形勢嚴重、當即按撳警鈴、捕房聞警、立即派出大批警備車、華捕西探及印捕等均先後馳至、本報記者獲聞此訊、當亦馳往調查、當見寗波路·山東路·及山西路·北京路間、各停有紅色警備車兩輛、共計達六輛之多、此外捕房公事車亦多到塲、各路口及山西路上、西探華捕印捕計達二三百人、均持槍林立、形勢之緊張、殊爲租界上捕盜案中特有之配備、</p>
<p>劇盜拒捕宛如巷戰</p>
<p>記者在該處戒備森嚴中、獲悉盜黨衝入該號後、即以武器向重要職員威逼、令其交出財物、並即肆意搜刦、損失數目、因該號事主未能晤見、故猶未悉共詳、正當盜黨搜刦將畢、呼嘯出門之際、老閘及中央捕房所派之警備車、均已馳至、探警常即出檢嚇令盜黨止步、盜黨見形勢不佳、紛擬逃竄、當被探捕出槍轟擊、盜黨旋亦開放盒子砲、當時子彈橫飛、雙方發槍達數白響之多、探捕亦有攀登鄰近屋頂、與盜黨交鋒、附近鄰居、猝聞連珠槍聲、均頗驚悸、其寓該處附近之住戶、外出歸去者、均被阻止通行、男女老幼、交頭接耳、均面現憂慮之色、</p>
<p>兩盜斃命西捕重傷</p>
<p>記者旋至北京路、見該處印捕手提馬槍、鵠立於路上者的六十餘人、西捕等均身穿鋼絲馬甲、往來馳驅、極爲忙碌、嗣復於彈聲斷續中、至種德里、見該處被擊斃之盜匪、倒於里口者計有兩名、週身彈痕纍纍、宛如蜂窠、當山救護車送往巡捕醫院、當劇戰時、探捕因奮勇捕盜、致受槍傷者有副捕頭摩爾、臂部受輕傷、三道頭西捕柯克、頭頸部受重傷、亦即車送公濟醫院醫治、此外聞尙有華探等數人受傷、</p>
<p>放流淚彈生擒五盜</p>

<h3>一九三九年度　上海工人生活狀況</h3>
<p>本篇所採上海工人生活狀况之統計資料、爲生活費、零售物價、工資及工作時閒叫種·本年度因時局關係、影響及於經濟及工商業之活動、勞工生活、亦與昔日大不相同也·</p>
<p>基期之變更一九三八年本局年報所發表之生活費指數率以一九三六年爲基期、工資指數則以一九三〇年爲奉期·自本年始、爲參證便易徵引明顯起見、改以九三六年爲基期·是年爲中日之爭前一年、其時政治、經濟、社會各方面情勢、均尙平穩、用爲基期、最足表示戰事起後演變之趨向、較之遠溯九二六年、自史適當·故本年度生活費及工資指數、均改依新基期核計、以後當準此例、期歸一律·</p>
<p>工人福利之衛量</p>
<p>本年度工人之實際收入及生活費用工人階級之福利、當以收入之豐嗇、及生活費用之高下衡量之·所入豐而所出少、則生活優俗、反是即不免於拮据·本年度百物騰貴、生活費用、高於戰前、以一九三六年爲基期、則本年生活費指數爲二〇三·二五、然一月至五月指數、尙在一五〇至一六五之間、故全年平均、僅有此數、其實下半年生活費用猛漲、九月至二八三·二三、十二月竟至三○四·〇六·生活費用高、則貨幣價値低、故在一九三九年度法幣一元之購買力（貨幣購買力即生活費指數之倒數）恰當一九三六年度之四角九分二厘、而一九三九年十二月份之一元僅當三角二分八厘九毫而已·然本年工資亦較高、工資率指數爲一〇九·〇九、實際收入指數爲二九·〇九·實際收入、乃指工資之外、又有津貼、而罰款及假期工資、皆已扣去而言者·本年工資之高、以年終爲甚、故全年平均、尙不足以顯示歲來情形·今依全年平均而論、收入所增、不足百分之二十、支出所增、乃至百分之一百有奇、得不償失、殆無疑義·故兩者並升、而遲速有別、設欲明其實際生活狀况、宜將貨幣工資改核爲眞實工資也·眞實工資即貨幣工資之購買能力眞實工資指數者、依生活費用之高下、而測貨幣工資購買力之升降也·眞實工資之核計法、以生活費指數除同時期之實際收入指數而得之·茲列一九三六年至一九三九年之眞實工資指數如下：</p>
<p>就上列數字而觀、一九三七年及一九三八年間、實際收入甚低、一九三九年較高、而生活費指數則逐年上漲甚劇·故本年眞實工資指數、降至五八·五九換言之、木年收入雖增、而眞實工資僅及一九三六年百分之六十弱、由此可知貨幣工資之高、對於工人生活狀况、實未改善、且較往年史爲艱苦也·（一）</p>

<p>本棉交易全屬停頓、緣濃歷年關將屆、各號業已結束、等待來年再作舉動、所以成交沉靜、惟午後聞匯市續縮、人心尤振、不過行市未曾做開、蘇北來源、計通花三百二十七包云、</p>
<p>浙省姚棉每年運滬為數至鉅、中日戰事發生後、運滬大見減少、去秋新棉收成甚佳、惟經政府實行統制、故姚花來滬已絕跡、茲悉前日（三十一日）太古公司黃浦輪、自　返滬、裝儎全船棉花九千六百五十四包來滬、該花自二十八年度新花至今為第一批、係美商恒達洋行所採購、（祖）</p>
<p>另訊、外棉市價、紐約棉市、昨日晨初先因投機者之購買而漲、後因現貨商及利物浦帮之在市抛賣、市況因之轉疲、結果收盤價格較之上日小三五磅音、印度市況殊為堅挺、漲起十餘羅比、惟預測回跌、結果較之上日無甚軒輊、埃及漲四十餘磅音、利物浦現貨漲二十餘便士、遠期跌十餘便士、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、昨日滙兌忽趨緊縮、況年關將屆、同業對於外棉之購辦殊為鬆懈、棉紗價格雖高、然廠方對於原棉暫無意購買、日方廠方亦然、茲將昨日棉市以美滙七元半折合送廠價如下、</p>

<h3>糧食　回籠粉　高價疊出　綠砲車售至十二元二角</h3>
<p>麵粉　昨日粉市、又創新高價、蓋自各廠限制供應以來、雖云廠盤未動、實際上已無貨可購、而一般需要者、更於廠盤未加之前、亟亟要求、在供少求多環境之下、市面日益猖獗、回籠粉價節節上騰、疊見新高峰、聞昨市綠砲車棧單漲達十二元二角、比前日又漲角半、老車棧單亦至十一元六角、惟貨方均擬待諸新年紅盤、再以善價脫手、故成交不過一二千包、本街零批交易亦不足五千包、照此局面、粉市漲風恐一時難遏、蓋昨日市塵、謠言紛紛、金市狂漲、與外匯緊縮、均在促使物價之高騰、小民生計、殊屬堪虞耳、</p>
<p>小麥　昨小麥市況、尚無特殊變化、最高價仍站二十元原盤、自粉價步漲以來、國麥存到兩少、貨主莫不一再居奇、又值年關期近、各方均備結束、市場更少售出、除部份直接配廠外、成交祗數百包、計開蘇州麥二十元、烏衣麥十九元九角五分、鎮江麥較次貨十九元三角、正式交易、恐將待諸新年紅盤中矣、</p>
<h3>杜粳交易有限　洋米去路獨旺</h3>
<p>昨日米市場、已通告米黃色市、准於四日結束、故市上交易已屬有限、大都屬於本街店胃添購而已、昨由虹口區輸出者有早晚稻二三百包、而一般客販、大都從事結束、不願再求脫手、一有問津、扳俏異常、故又打破前市之徘徊局面、反呈帶緊之色、結果各貨行情除薄粳等國米已無能有所變化、依限盤外、白元時令應需品在糕鋪飯擔暢銷之下、挺秀半元光景、洋米則已成市上唯一之大宗去路、脚地既固、人又歡迎、所以際此俏檔、行情見升四五角不等、計一號西貢收盤特別為四十二元、市至四十一元七角、二號西貢為四十元零四角、火絞四十元零五角、至四十元零三角、大絞三十七元半、米粞三十二元五角至三十二元二角、東京砶尖特自三十八元半、次至三十七元八角、統計全市成交數、祗有五千餘包而已、</p>

<h3>糖市　糖價提高</h3>
<p>昨糖市以外匯緊縮、人心不衰、價又提高、二四本棧粗砂白升一元、為五十九元、外棧貨升二三角、新化為五十九元、老貨五十八元六角至五角、轉口貨升五角、為四十九元、太古糖各嘜均升五角、B嘜西棧貨五十九元、東棧貨五十八元五角、CW嘜西棧五十八元、東棧五十七元五角、CX等嘜西棧均為五十七元五角、東棧均為五十七元、H嘜車亦不更、仍為四十二元、荷赤亦未更為四十四元五角、本綿白漲度同、粗砂同等亦升一元、振記一號白五十九元、二號五十八元五角、本廠永七十元〇五角、晶明永七十一元、荷蘭電粗砂K.G.荷幣十一盾一角五C.I.F.算云、</p>
<h3>五金　實銷受挫</h3>
<p>五金交易、一二天來一無足述、蓋外埠客帮已收行歸里、各貨少人問津、本街方面、如廠家及囤戶門市小買戶等、俱因農歷年底預備大結束、且現銀尤屬緊迫、故對於各五金品之購買力、亦形薄弱、是以前昨成交異常微細、且連日風雨不息、五金品中容易鐵锈之花色、（如馬口鐵·會司鐵·平白鐵·白鉛皮等）不能出門、故生意清淡、開介亦無甚上落、</p>

<p>貧病福音</p>
<h3>美國難民醫院</h3>
<p>— 若夢</p>
<p>掛號祇要一分治療完全免費</p>
<p>在亮閃閃的黃金上建築起來的上海，無論什麼東西都得化錢的。「立要立錢，坐要坐錢」，正是一句一針見血的話呢。</p>
<p>別的我們不談它吧，單說生了病，已够你麻煩了。有錢的，反正是有錢，化大資本，進大醫院，醫藥費，治療費，成百成千，是滿不在乎的。但是我們窮小子，連吃飯也日擔夜憂，一旦生起病來，那眞是束手無策，祇好聽其自然，跟病魔鬥。鬥勝了，額角頭；鬥敗了，祇好一命嗚呼，誰也不可憐你一句。</p>
<p>雖然上海也不乏慈善機關，免費治療的。但總覺得范圍不够廣大，沒有普遍到各階層去；而且大都因為經費的問題，把許多有益大衆的計劃，或多或少的被困難阻碍了。</p>
<p>這裏，讓筆者忠懇地向全市貧苦大衆介紹一個免費治療的醫院吧，那就是「美國難民醫院」（American　Hospital　For　Refugees）</p>
<p>「美國難民醫院」是由美國同仁醫院所附設的，不但設備完善，而且醫師大多都是名手。他們的設立，為的是眞正要負起拯救貧苦大衆的責任，因此，無論治療，住院，醫藥，完全免費。祇要在掛號時，付掛號費一分而已。假使連這一分也付不起的話，那也並不打緊，因為這一分錢僅是一種手續罷了。</p>
<p>現在他們不但每天門診的人數很多，而且亦收容了許多病重的人，包括了內外各科。而且，雖然是免費，但裏面病人的食料及診療，老實說，比普通納費的醫院還講究哩。</p>
<p>最後，「美國難民醫院」的地址，是在兆豐花園對面白利南路三十七號。</p>
<p>「如此上海」徵文</p>
<h3>留下買路錢</h3>
<p>— 朱綠</p>
<p>輪船靠近外灘花園了，大都市巍峨的建築物和輝煌的燈火，立刻閃入了我的眼簾。</p>
<p>當我們剛剛把四五件行李提到岸上，人力車夫，汽車夫，馬車夫的羣立刻把我們包圍住了。我們好容易雇定了其中的兩輛人力車，將四五件行李分別裝上。我的一輛車在前面才拉得幾十步，又給剛才那班兜車子的一羣重新包圍住：</p>
<p>「小兄弟，飯嘸沒吃了，幫幫忙！」四五個粗黑的拳頭在我的兩條臂膀上擂着，在我的面前揚着，而且有一二個傢伙，把食指和中指藏在胸衣裏裝做手槍模樣向我威嚇：</p>
<p>「快點，快點！猪玀，打勒！」</p>
<p>我這時正有大小三件行李裝在車上，動不得身，兩手因為護着行李，動彈不得；而且這裏離開崗警，已有四五支路。</p>
<p>「好好，我拿給你們。」我一面用手向懷裏掏着錢，一面用脚蹬着車叫立定了的人力車夫走，然而人力車夫却木然不動，這不得不使我眞的掏出錢來了。我起初想摸幾張角票給他們，可是，按放角票的錶袋裏却空無所有；這是，我發急了，不得不從另一只袋裏，掏出了一個裏面包着三四元的紙包來。我解了開來，拿着一張一元票給右面的一個，然而我的左手握着的剩餘的幾塊錢，也就立刻給左面幾個傢伙搶了去。</p>
<p>我吐了口氣，立刻又蹬脚叫拉車的開步走。我們的人和車的小浪花開始沒入人和車的大海裏去了。</p>
<h3>關於售票員揩油</h3>
<p>— 若鶩</p>
<p>關於公共汽車電車售票員的揩油，最近各報上都展開了熱烈的討論，有的談到道德問題，有的發表制止辦法，但是都沒有深入售票員的生活狀况，祇是「治標」的方法而已。上月本刋曾登過一篇「改良售票揩油的我見」，作者以南市華商電車公司售票員所以不揩油的三項原因為我們作參考，這是値得注意的。</p>
<p>在生活程度較戰前高漲到數倍以上的現在，以勞力為生的各階層，都是過着非常慘痛的生活，售票員當然不能例外，所以談道德問題實在是離題太遠了，而制止辦法呢，在沒有發生效力之前，更發現了變本加厲，僱用了望風，大揩其油的新聞。</p>
<p>所幸的，這揩油秘密是由公司便衣西籍查票員發見的，那個售票員如何處罰，新聞中沒有講到，我們不知道；我們也不必知道，不過這秘密（據我推測，揩油秘密恐怕還不止「望風」一種）旣是由公司自己發見的，總不見得僅僅處罰那個售票員就了事，他們一定推本窮源，去追索在發見的售票員以外的其他售票員是否也有同樣的弊病，及售票員所以要揩油的原因，再由公司當局商議消弭這種「秘密」的妥策，則比較我們隔搔癢，要有效得多。</p>
<h3>雨過天青</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第二十回　世界交通同文共語　兒童敎育獎學憐才</p>
<p>關於這顏色問題，有人說：在其間，有文野之別。大約在些半開化的民族，總喜歡大紅大綠的，因為這樣的顏色，纔足以刺激人。小兒也喜歡這個大紅顏色，倘然把一樣紅的玩具與紅的果子，擺在別樣顏色的一處，他就先抓了紅色的。還有中國的內地鄕村間，從前十七八歲的大姑娘，還是穿着大紅布棉襖，或是大紅布褲子，至少也得紥兩條紅帶。到了都會之地，要是年靑女子，還這樣打扮，人家便要說村氣了。又如軍士的衣服，囚犯的衣服，從前也是紅色的，如今都改變起來了。戰爭與罪犯，都是屬於不文明的，然則顏色問題，果然有文野之別嗎？其實如紅色之類，與人經刺激，那是眞的，不能便在這上面分出文野來。而且顏色是　然的文明，世界的彩色。花是紅的，你不能敎它盡變成白的，葉是綠的。你不能敎它盡變成紫的。從前一代有一代所尚的顏色，如今也還一國有一國所尚的顏色。中國吉禮尚紅，因為吉禮總是喜事，而紅色是足以刺激使人喜悅罷了。今天有許多女西賓來游玩的，她們倒也不討厭這紅色，她們有幾們還穿了紅色的衣服咧，倒覺得有些富麗堂皇的氣槪。此時這新房裏，擠滿了許多中西女賓，由金澹雲親自招待。停了一刻兒，吳君可便上西車站，回到蘇州去了，金澹雲送了她不少的喜果。本來君素要送她到車站的，她說：不要，用不着送。君素又囑咐她：星期一代告一天假的事，說星期二一准回來。她們在金澹雲家裏，玩到十二點鐘，大家也就各散了。到了明天，上午九點鐘的時候，何家兩們小姐便到國際飯店，去訪問她們從北平來的那位父執江鏡蓉先生，果然已經來了。這位江先生，和何先生也是老朋友了，但是這兩位小姐，今日還是第一次見面。這因為兩位小姐，在外國留學了多年，因此有許多親友，漸見生疏了。原來這位江鏡蓉先生，年紀也有五十多了，是一位黑蒼蒼的臉兒，頭髪也漸已花白。要講他的出身，也是很苦的，他是一個少年孤露的人。他的父親在他八歲上就故世了，只有一個母親，却倒有兩個妹妹。　（二三五）</p>
<h3>煤荒！</h3>
<p>— 新夢</p>
<p>食米被操縱，麵粉被囤積，煤又有人壟斷市塲，而大鬧起煤荒來。其實，煤眞的鬧荒嗎？正和過去的米荒和麵粉荒一樣，是受了私人的壟斷操縱。煤炭同業在說煤鬧荒了，將要缺貨，但浦東不是囤有大量的存煤在待好價而出售嗎？</p>
<p>煤價疾速的高漲，這問題也是極端的嚴重，尤其這幾大，我們在報上可以看出熟水業的恐慌情形。一般的人家，每天要上老虎灶泡水，熟水為了煤價，過往曾漲過幾次，煤這樣的漫無限制的上漲下去，就非迫使老虎灶再漲價不可，而且上自各業工廠，下至大餅，饅頭，粢飯攤頭，那一種不需煤來做燃料，所以煤價的上漲，又會促使好多物品漲價的。</p>
<p>然而問題最嚴重的却要算煤球了，在半個月裏，煤球很快的由每擔四元，漲到四元六角，而且據煤炭店老闆說，看模樣還要漲，將出五元的關。大家知道，煤球是上海居民的主要燃料，如果有人作一統計，每天煤球的消費，數字一定不小的，那就可見他影響市民生活的重大了。</p>
<p>煤價的極度高漲，所發生的影響旣如上述，而這次煤的缺少，又並不是眞正鬧煤荒，為的有人囤積居奇，操縱市塲，我們深望關心市民生活的社會人士，對此問題也應迅速加以注意。尤其望「孤島」的當局，立刻採取有效處置，取締囤戶，抑低售價，才能使小市民可减輕些不能忍耐受的苦痛呢。</p>

<p>㳺藝界</p>
<h3>談行將到滬之奎德社</h3>
<p>— 天馬</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>奎德社的應聘來滬，可算是海上劇壇最近的動態，不過奎德社三個字在海上顧曲界的腦筋中，似乎有些陌生，這裏讓我來介紹一些關於她們的一切，也可種爲應時的遊藝文字吧。奎德社並不像他人所說的是女子科班。不過是一個由女藝員們組織的劇團而已，在華北有將近三十年的歷史，最初是由鮮靈芝張筱仙等領銜，而且是梆子與皮簧混合的班子，那時在故都中很受一般王府貴族的太太小姐們歡迎。所演的戲爲迎合一般觀衆心理起見，戲本則多側重在家庭倫理方面，用佈景穿時裝念白話唱京調在那時眞是盛極一時，在故都梨園界中很佔一個地位</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>時代的變遷，使奎德社也不能列爲例外，在民國十年以後，一般老角色差不多都嫁的嫁走的走於是乎新陳代謝式的又有新角色出現。像紅極一時的張艷芬·秦鳳雲·雪艷琴等，都先後在社中担任過如牌旦角，同時戲本方面也隨着潮流側重在愛情哀情的編製。不過彼時都中時常因爲政局的演變，梨園界直接或間接都受到相當影響，奎德社也只勉强支持殘局。一部啼笑姻緣可算爲復興奎德社的劇本，那時頭牌旦角是曾經來滬的李桂雲，老生筱蘭芬，花臉王慶奎，營業之盛冠於一時，於是先後被約往天津四五次之多，而每次俱是載譽而回。可惜好景不常，內部發生意見，於是李桂雲退出另組馨德社於天津，繼而又有同德社對峙於北平，奎德社的人材也隨之而鼎足三分，幾乎一蹶不起。幸而老板楊韻譜主持有方，以坤旦鮮蕊芳爲大樑，尙能維持殘局，後李桂雲來滬者，乃彼之馨德社，而實非奎德社也。</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>奎德社雖以便裝新劇著名，而實際仍注重老戲，一切組織悉按戲班規矩，文武管事上下手武行等亦一應俱全，除大軸爲本戲外，餘亦爲老戲由各角分担。有時亦排連台本戲，若濟公活佛，西遊記，天河配……等，此外更從電影中編排，若當年之姊妹花，再生花，桃花泣血記，啼笑姻緣，梅花落，一個大學生……等是。他若說部名作茶花女，二孤女，賴婚，壹圓錢，綠窗殘淚，玉梨魂，日出，雷雨……等，亦皆採爲劇本，而加以改編，按角色之輕重，挿入各種唱工，較之近日所謂改良平劇者，有過之無不及也。</p>
<h3>「中旅」將演「葛嫩娘」</h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>王獻齋夫婦客串鄭芝龍夫婦</p>
<p>「西太后」已在趕製佈景道具</p>
<p>「中旅」經過改組之後，一面打電報到香港去要若靑回來，一面唐槐秋就在這機會中到明華補　「孔夫子」。現在若青已從香港回來了，他們決定在廢歷大除夕晚上繼續公演。上演的戲也出乎我們意料之外，並不是「西太后」而是「葛嫩娘」，據說是觀衆要求演這個戲的。</p>
<p>據筆者探得的「葛嫩娘」陣容，除唐若靑的葛嫩娘，陳琦的美娘，施汶的孫克咸，屠光啟的蔡如蘅，劉瓊的鄭成功嚴斐的馬金子，章志直的博洛等是觀衆所熟知之外，鄭芝龍和田氏是請王獻齋袁竹如夫婦客串。</p>
<p>至於預吿了許久的的「西太后」，已在趕製佈景道具，等到「葛嫩娘」上演之後，一邊就排演「西太后」，導演大概依舊是吳永剛。</p>
<h3>梨園外紀</h3>
<p>— 徐慕雲</p>
<p>金嗓子壞了</p>
<p>金嗓子、鐵嗓子、原是指的角兒嗓音堅實，愈唱愈亮，永遠不壞的意思。倘使伶人在中年後一近女色，那怕天賦再佳，也要立刻敗嗓，而有塌中之危的。少山多奎兩人，在凈角老旦兩行中倒的確可以稱得起是今日的鳳毛麟角；論該兩人唱出的韻味，雖不甚醉厚，然而天生佳喉，總可使聽者精神爲之振奮。可惜近來據北平來人言：他們兩人的嗓子全都出了毛病啦。多奎本有愛蓮癖，當其屢赴太原獻技時，父無其父在旁監視，當然可以鬯所欲爲；迨返平後嗓即一度失潤，旋經其胞兄密禀其父，嚴加約束，並經契友勸導鼓勵，故始痛改前非，力自振作，近年竟掙得老旦首席地位，這總算伶界之利，同時亦屬彼個人之幸了。殊不知他老父於去年謝世失去了他的戒懼心，此番南下出演更新，又大受台下歡迎，復增加了他的驕傲心。返抵故都後，再無益友從旁勗勉，於是山倣生怠，躭於佚樂，酒色（李極好飲）並行，遂致把嗓弄壞。際此老旦行極端缺乏人才的時候，假使多奎再日益沒落，步臥雲的後塵，那實在是太可惜了。不佞很希望這是傳聞之誤，才不負我對他期望之殷呢。（一八〇）</p>
<h3>劇運工作者　孔麟等聯袂離滬</h3>
<p>— 飄絮</p>
<p>祝諸君為本位努力</p>
<p>在不久以前，新都劇塲曾一度有兒童星期劇塲的開闢，那時跟它合作而以推動劇運爲目的底戲劇工作實踐者；便是這裏所要發表離滬遄赴內地的「中華戲劇研究會」。</p>
<p>他們這班會員是一大羣生活在惡濁的環境裏而欲憑自己的膂力爲衝破環境而戰鬥的靑年羣，爲了國家，爲了藝術，他們留在此時此地的「孤島」上仍不稍减天眞熱情和英勇的鬥爭，兩年悠長也算短促的日子中，他們展開了工作上最可寳貴的一面。</p>
<p>在「孤軍營」，對於浴血抗戰民族健兒們的慰勞演戲，幾乎是往常的工作，在難民所，他們正像一團火燄，在生動現實的景而中，許多的淚水湧出了難胞們的眼眶，不僅是抓緊哀鴻們親切沉痛的傷痕，而且他們更盡了可能積極的敎育意義的演出。</p>
<p>是一月前，光芒燦爛的描寫民族英雄「文大祥」的獨幕劇本出版了，孔麟，於是普遍的爲整個劇運工作羣衆所愛戴，然而，正也因了這，他小能不走，在冬天，免不了的是一陣朔風想摧毀一股太微弱的生命喲！終於他不能不率領了年靑努力的工作者們被迫離開了「孤島」，奔向後方工作去了。</p>
<p>在偉大的時代動盪中，「中華戲劇研究會」是在文化崗位上確立起自己的本位了。</p>
<h3>玉趾流香</h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>左玲娜是以足尖舞著稱的，所以這部轟動紐約的舞台劇，被華納公司搬上了銀幕。</p>
<p>「玉趾流香」的故事和其他的歌舞片一樣，介紹了兩塲表演之外，穿挿以一個男女主人公的羅曼斯。但是這故事和「銀國春秋」的指出默片的必然淘汰那樣，它也指出在電影事業崛起之後，遊藝班的生涯必然衰落。在我們中國，正有一部份守舊者死抱着「骨董」，而不知改良，這眞是如何危險的「論調」！</p>
<p>「玉趾流香」的導演者在竭力介紹兩塲表演，運用活潑的鏡頭使左玲娜的足尖舞，有充份發展的機會之外，劉於羅曼斯的煊染，反在加强各種笑料之下，所以，爲了消遣而消遣，「玉趾流香」看看倒也嘸哈。</p>
<p>飾菲力浦的埃第亞爾伯，不是小生人材，他的面部平扳是最大的缺點。亞倫海爾頗有佛萊克毛根的作風，他爲「玉趾流香」加挿了不少笑料。</p>
<p>粵劇新訊　港粵名班大羅天，不日來滬，准農曆元旦假座虞洽卿路福州路口大中華劇塲表演粵劇，藝員有武生新珠，此君擅演三國誌關公劇，在南方素有活關公之稱。文武生伍元熹。風流個儻，小武顧天吾，於武劇方面堪稱獨步，此兩名角前曾來滬奏藝，頗爲一般人所贊譽。花旦甘義運，色藝雙超，唱做俱臻妙境，詼諧生劉少文，每演一劇，四座生風，其詼諧處眞有令人捧腹，此數名角在港粵南洋一帶，早負盛名，現更助以多位優等各角，當有一番熱鬧也。</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops in Eastern Henan Feel Great Panic: Chinese Troops Charge into Kaifeng Railway Station; Fierce Fighting Around Jingshan, Chinese Troops Recapture a Stronghold; Japanese Troops Deployed to Guangxi for Reinforcements, a Major Battle is About to Erupt</h3>
<p>Zhengzhou: Chinese troops in eastern Henan, with rapid movements, launched a fierce attack on the Japanese troops entrenched at the Kaifeng Railway Station. The Japanese troops, in a state of panic, responded hastily and were caught off guard. Chinese troops charged into the station and inflicted heavy casualties, seizing numerous spoils of war and setting fire to the station's No. 4 warehouse. Flames soared into the sky. Currently, Japanese soldiers in the city are in a state of great panic. It is reported that the Japanese troops suffered extremely heavy losses in this battle. (A dispatch from the 1st)</p>
<p>Chongqing: The Chinese military spokesperson, while meeting with reporters today to discuss the Sino-Japanese war situation, indicated that a major battle may occur in the Nanning area soon. It is reported that Japanese reinforcements are continuously entering Guangxi, and are now concentrated in the coastal area and Nanning, totaling three and a half divisions.

<h3>Wind Direction Changes Outside Dagu Port</h3>
<p>Tianjin: For the past week, due to strong northeasterly winds, the ice at Dagu Port has become very thick, making it extremely difficult for cargo ships to contact ships outside the port, causing many delays in loading and unloading cargo.

<h3>Reasons for the Failure of the Soviet-Mongolian-Japanese-Manchukuo Joint Committee on Border Demarcation: The Documents Submitted by Both Sides Could Not Be Agreed Upon</h3>
<p>Moscow: TASS recently published a commentary on the work of the Joint Committee on Border Demarcation between Manchukuo and Mongolia: "The Joint Committee includes representatives from the Soviet Union, Mongolia, Japan, and Manchukuo. Its purpose is to establish the correct border between Mongolia and Manchukuo based on official documents. The main work of the Joint Committee at the meetings held in Chita and Harbin in December of last year and January of this year was to review the aforementioned official documents. At that time, the documents submitted by the Japanese and Manchukuo delegations aimed to prove that there was a need to reorganize the border. Upon investigation, the border on that side had already been established, and there had been no disputes in the past. Moreover, the documents of the Japanese and Manchukuo representatives lacked the nature of formal and powerful documents, so the Soviet and Mongolian representatives immediately refused to recognize these documents as a basis for demarcation. At the same time, the Japanese and Manchukuo sides also refused to recognize the official documents submitted by the Soviet and Mongolian representatives. Each side insisted on its own position, and the Joint Committee disbanded without any decision." (A dispatch from the 1st, TASS)</p>
<h3>Preparations for the Nanyang Overseas Chinese Comfort Mission</h3>
<p>Chongqing: According to a dispatch from Singapore, since the Nanyang Overseas Chinese Fundraising General Association initiated the organization of a comfort mission to return to China, overseas Chinese in various places have unanimously and enthusiastically supported it. Government authorities, such as the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the Executive Yuan and the Overseas Department, have sent telegrams of commendation. The Nanyang Overseas Chinese Fundraising General Association is actively preparing to realize it in the shortest possible time. The preparations are briefly described as follows: The Nanyang Overseas Chinese Fundraising General Association has now stipulated that the comfort mission be divided into six routes, totaling six sub-missions, each with a minimum of six people and a maximum of twelve people. Currently, in addition to the Malay Peninsula, overseas Chinese in various places can elect about thirty people, and various places in Malaya can elect thirty to forty people. The Singapore overseas Chinese population accounts for one-quarter of Malaya, and nine to ten people should be sent. The Aid China Fundraising Conference decided to hand over the task to a committee separately organized by the directors of the various associations to handle the matter. The candidates are to be solicited by mail by each association, and the director of the association is responsible for guaranteeing the selected candidates. Currently, the Hokkien Association has guaranteed four people, the Chaozhou and Hakka Associations have two people each, and the Hainanese and Sanjiang Associations have one person each, totaling ten people. As for the expenses, in addition to the travel expenses of each mission member being provided by public funds, subsidies will also be given to the families of each mission member to avoid the families being affected during the mission members' return to China. Once the candidates from overseas Chinese in various places have been elected, they will set off to return to China to comfort the loyal and brave anti-Japanese soldiers.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Britain's Self-Esteem and Diplomatic Demeanor</h3>
<p>The compatibility of diplomacy among countries lies not only in the differences in their policies, objectives, methods, and applications, but also in their differences over time and circumstances; each also has its own demeanor. The formation of demeanor comes from culture, national character, and innate traditions, so it is different from the beginning. The demeanor held by former Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov was very unlike the demeanor of the Soviet Union, so although he was highly respected for a time, he ultimately failed to achieve his ambitions. Because Britain and France dealt with Litvinov, and then dealt with Molotov, they ended up being incompatible and losing all opportunities. Japan, seeing the mild demeanor of the United States, regarded it as policy that was perfunctory, objectives that were uncertain, methods that were circuitous, and applications that were clumsy; when the United States announced the abolition of the commercial treaty, Japan began to change its attitude; and at the last moment of the expiration of the announcement, the United States still had no intention of negotiating temporary measures, and Japan began to feel discouraged. These two things are both due to the authorities' failure to recognize the other party's diplomatic demeanor and mistakenly entering a divergent path. The purpose of this statement is only to confirm that the differences in demeanor are of great importance; and those who engage in diplomacy or even observe diplomacy must recognize the demeanor of each country. As for what is the characteristic of each country's demeanor, it may be obvious or obscure or contradictory and coexisting; although it cannot be called mysterious, it is very subtle, difficult to understand, and even more difficult to explain. It is like saying what the culture of a certain country is like, or what the national character is like, it is also difficult to quickly obtain its concise and accurate outline.</p>
<p>In the current international situation, Britain is a very important factor in determining the future of many issues; and under the current circumstances, pursuing the entire posture of British diplomacy is particularly difficult; how can one not say that it is possible to review what the Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary have said? But how can the Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary say everything? For example, Britain's words, actions, and the principles it declares as the basis for them, are inconsistent with regard to Czechoslovakia and Poland, China and Finland, Japan and Germany, and the Soviet Union; they are almost unlike the actions of the same country, the same era, and the same Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary. However, hundreds of years later, when studying the historical facts of today, how do we know that we cannot suddenly realize that all the differences of today are firmly within the traditional demeanor of Britain?</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, that is, January 31, British Prime Minister Chamberlain gave a foreign policy speech at the "Public Interest Protection Committee," which involved the Asama Maru incident between Britain and Japan. He said:</p>
<p>"From the purely international law point of view, the two governments may have different interpretations, but the life of a nation and the psychology of mankind are not the most powerful factors based on legal issues. If the Japanese people or the Japanese government believe that our country deliberately exercises the rights of a belligerent at will, disregarding international courtesy and the Japanese nation as a whole, then the matter is more melancholy for us than anything else. It must be known that our strong enemies have no scruples, and in order to eliminate their plans, we must implement various things that we do, but we are willing to live in peace with friendly countries and are determined not to take any measures to offend the self-esteem of this friendly country."</p>
<p>Incidents like the Asama Maru incident are indeed so-called small matters, and we are happy to hear that small matters are resolved without incident; but if it is said that "the life of a nation and the psychology of mankind are not the most powerful factors based on legal issues," then it will not only give people the feeling that "Chamberlain's psychology is unpredictable," but also raise doubts about British diplomacy and international disputes, because what factors will it follow? Furthermore, the so-called Britain "is determined not to take any measures to offend the self-esteem of this friendly country" is indeed a benevolent and reasonable attitude, and we earnestly hope that the international community can universally adopt this attitude. If Japan can refrain from offending China's self-esteem, and Germany can refrain from offending the self-esteem of Czechoslovakia and Poland, then "there would be nothing wrong in the world"; for those who offend the self-esteem of other countries, such as National Socialists, we should defend Chamberlain by saying that he has no right to demand that Britain abandon its war objectives of destroying National Socialism and the National Socialist regime based on self-esteem; however, we cannot help but hope that Chamberlain will use his self-esteem to take measures to exert Britain's self-esteem in the Far East regarding treaties and fairness; and take measures for self-esteem to restore what has been violated in the Far East. We firmly believe that the general British overseas Chinese in China, especially the British overseas Chinese in Tianjin, can maintain their traditional self-esteem.</p>
<p>"Seeing the microcosm to know the macrocosm" and "inferring the general case from one instance" are not applicable to the entire diplomatic posture of Britain under the diplomatic demeanor of Britain; otherwise, Chamberlain's words to the Asama Maru incident the day before yesterday will cause the people of the world who sympathize with Britain to retain their sympathy for Britain and replace it with doubt. Because the British way of doing things is that whatever is said about this case is only about this case and does not involve other matters. Therefore, regarding the Asama Maru incident, Britain's attitude towards Japan is like this; regarding the Sino-Japanese issue, on the same day, Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs Butler reiterated in the House of Commons that the British government had stated in a note to the Japanese government on January 14 of last year that it still wanted to abide by the principles of the Washington Nine-Power Treaty. This attitude has not changed," so there is no doubt, and it is even more gratifying. The original formation of demeanor comes from culture, national character, and innate traditions, so those who care about demeanor cannot expect to revise or change it; the fact that British demeanor sometimes makes people doubtful does not detract from the clarity and decisiveness of Britain's final measures; and Britain, as a nation with self-esteem, can provide a valuable guarantee for its demeanor and clear and decisive measures.</p>
<h3>US Senate Foreign Relations Committee Reviews the Bill to Implement Neutrality Laws in the Far East; Will Review Various Bills on Embargoing Japan; It is Reported that the US Government is Considering Lending to China</h3>
<p>Washington: The Senate Foreign Relations Committee today elected several members to form a subcommittee, chaired by Democratic Senator George, to review the bill proposed by Republican Senator Key Pittman, a prominent isolationist, which advocates declaring a state of war between China and Japan, thereby implementing the current neutrality laws for both China and Japan. After the meeting, Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Pittman told the press that his proposed bill, which advocates implementing an embargo against Japan, will be submitted for discussion only after the Foreign Relations Committee decides its attitude towards the Key Pittman proposal. (A dispatch from the 30th, Havas)</p>
<p>Washington: According to Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Pittman, when the embargo bill is submitted for discussion, he will ask State Department officials to attend as representatives of the government. Democratic Senator Norris and Republican Senator Johnson have been appointed as members of the subcommittee to consider the plan proposed by Democratic Senator Gillette to implement neutrality laws in the Far East. It is reported that the bill to implement an embargo against Japan is not planned to be submitted to the subcommittee for review. All proposals will be reviewed by all members of the Foreign Relations Committee as soon as possible. Well-informed sources speculate that the Foreign Relations Committee will begin to carefully review the situation in Japan. The committee wants to take resolute and prudent measures to deal with Japan. There is a widespread rumor in Congress that in order to deal with the situation in Japan, the government will lend to China through the US Export-Import Bank as indirect pressure, but this measure has not yet been included in the scope of discussion of the Foreign Relations Committee.

<p>Washington: Foreign affairs officials are quite pessimistic about the possibility of reaching a solution to the current difficulties between the United States and Japan.

<h3>Britain and Japan Continue Negotiations on the Asama Maru Incident; Craigie Receives the Japanese Reply; A Breakthrough is Possible</h3>
<p>Tokyo: British Ambassador to Japan Craigie visited Foreign Vice Minister Tani Masayuki at 10:40 am on the 1st to inquire about two or three matters regarding the Asama Maru incident, and left at 11:05 am, saying that the official negotiations between Britain and Japan on the Asama Maru incident were conducted by Craigie alone on the 31st, and negotiations will continue at 4 pm today, because the Foreign Minister will attend the parliament, the government's official document refuting the British government's statement, these two official documents will be published on the afternoon of the 3rd. (A dispatch from the 1st, Domei)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Japanese Foreign Minister Arita explained the Asama Maru incident as follows: "The occurrence of the Asama Maru incident this time occurred in the vicinity of Japan, so it aroused the anger of the Japanese people. The Japanese government expresses its regret on this point. When we received the news of this incident, in addition to informing the Japanese parties concerned about the truth of the incident, we also discussed ways to deal with the new situation of the incident. On the night of the 22nd, we urgently invited British Ambassador Craigie to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. At that time, because I had urgent business, I turned to Vice Minister Tani to tell him that 'the Japanese government regards the actions of the British warships in this incident as an unfriendly act,' so I requested that the British government quickly make a fully justified explanation, and 'the Japanese government reserves the right to demand the extradition of the detained Germans.' Finally, 'If this kind of incident continues to occur in the future,' then Japan's feelings towards Britain will deteriorate further. We hope that the British side will consider and handle this matter properly," etc., to point out its inappropriateness and lodge a serious protest. In particular, as for my message, that is, "From the perspective of legal basis, if a separate interpretation is made, Britain should focus on the overall situation and extradite the detained Germans, which is believed to be the best way for Japan and Britain to hear about it." The next day, the 23rd, I asked Ambassador Craigie to visit me, and I myself explained the Japanese government's views on this incident, and seriously pointed out the importance of the incident. After that, I met with the British Ambassador on the 25th, 27th, 20th, and 30th, examining various viewpoints on this incident to strive to implement Japan's claims. Regarding Japan's serious protest, the British government sent back a reply via Ambassador Craigie, but this reply mostly stated the British legal views, and intends to publish the British views recently. In short, it is to stand in opposition to Japan. In several negotiations in the local area and in London, the British government ultimately maintained the attitude that it could not sacrifice this legal view, but on the one hand, it seemed to be carefully considering stimulating Japanese public opinion. The Japanese government is carrying out legal discussions in parallel, standing on the overall situation of Japanese-British relations, and seeking the British side's reflection from a political point of view, in order to achieve a sensitive solution to this incident. We are currently working hard on this." (A dispatch from the 1st, Domei)</p>
<p>Tokyo: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement by the Director of Information at 7:30 pm today after Vice Minister Tani and British Ambassador Craigie concluded their meeting this afternoon. "Vice Minister Tani, in his capacity as representative of the Foreign Minister, invited British Ambassador Craigie to visit the Foreign Minister's official residence at 4 pm on February 1st, and the meeting lasted until 6 pm. During the meeting, the Vice Minister first handed over the Japanese reply to the British note on the Asama Maru case on January 27 to the British Ambassador. The British government will immediately publish the official documents of both Britain and Japan after receiving this Japanese reply. Today, the British Ambassador and the Vice Minister conducted discussions on the incident from a political and legal perspective, and will continue to hold talks tomorrow." (A dispatch from the 1st, Domei)</p>
<p>Tokyo: The Asahi Shimbun reported that the talks between British Ambassador Craigie and Japanese Foreign Minister Arita on the Asama Maru case are now gradually generating a more friendly atmosphere. Steps to resolve this case were apparently taken last night. It is reported that the British Ambassador expressed the British government's intention to formally declare that the incident occurred in a place near Japanese territory, which is unfortunate for both Britain and Japan. The British Ambassador also proposed a settlement, so it is expected that the Asama Maru case will end soon. (A dispatch from the 1st, Reuters)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Today's meeting between Foreign Vice Minister Tani Masayuki and British Ambassador Craigie made a comprehensive discussion on three points: extradition of the detained Germans, guaranteeing the future, and a formal apology from the British government. The result seems to be quite satisfactory. After three meetings between Britain and Japan, the claims of both sides have gradually become concrete. Therefore, British Ambassador Craigie telegraphed his home government last night, requesting important instructions, and the British government's instructions will certainly determine the future nature of the Asama Maru incident. After the British government's reply arrives, the next meeting will be held, around the evening of the 2nd or the 3rd. (A dispatch from the 1st, Domei)</p>
<h3>U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Discusses Assistance to Finland; Senator Harrison Proposes a Plan; Advocates Finnish Government to Issue Bonds in the U.S.</h3>
<p>Washington – The Senate Foreign Relations Committee convened today to discuss the issue of assisting Finland. First, Republican Senator Tan Naihan expressed his view, believing that since war has broken out between Finland and the Soviet Union, the United States should immediately implement neutrality laws for both countries. However, the Foreign Relations Committee made no decision on this matter. Next, Jones, the General Manager of the Federal Export-Import Bank, reported on the current situation of the bank and explained its attitude towards lending to various countries to enable them to purchase non-military supplies from the United States, stating that if the United States were to lend to Finland, it would not violate neutrality. The Foreign Relations Committee is scheduled to continue its meeting tomorrow and has invited Moore, Assistant Secretary of State, and Hackworth, Legal Advisor, to attend and explain the State Department's views. According to political circles, regarding the issue of assisting Finland, Senator Harrison, a Democrat, has proposed a plan advocating that the Finnish government issue bonds in the United States, allowing the American people to purchase them at will. This proposal is highly valued by members of the Foreign Relations Committee. However, opponents believe that these bonds lack sufficient guarantees and may be difficult to sell. As for the U.S. government formally providing assistance to Finland, it is feared that this would set a precedent. Therefore, the attitude of the senators remains hesitant. (Havas dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>Washington – Regarding the Finnish issue, Senator Harrison, Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, yesterday advocated allowing the Finnish government to raise public debt within the United States, rather than the U.S. government directly lending funds to the country. President Roosevelt, when meeting with newspaper reporters, stated that the government had no position on this proposal. Those in political circles believe that whether the Finnish government can issue bonds in the United States is solely determined by the Securities and Exchange Commission. (Havas dispatch, 31st)</p>
<h3>Guo Taiqi Visits British Undersecretary</h3>

<h3>British Government Continues to Adhere to the Principles of the Nine-Power Treaty; British Undersecretary Butler Answers Questions in the House of Commons</h3>
<p>London – Conservative Member of Parliament, Morgan, asked in the House of Commons last night whether the British government still adhered to the terms of the Washington Treaty, given the treaty negotiations between Japan and the Chinese puppet government. Undersecretary Butler replied that the British government had clarified its intention to adhere to the principles of the Nine-Power Treaty in a note to the Japanese government on January 14th, and that the British government still maintained this stance. Morgan also asked whether the Prime Minister had taken note of the peace conditions proposed by Japan to the Chinese puppet government, and whether the Foreign Office had received information from the ambassador to China or Japan regarding this matter. Butler replied that the British Ambassador to China had alerted the Foreign Office to the agreement made by Wang Jingwei and the Japanese government on December 30th. The original text had been sent by airmail to Britain, was published in a Chinese newspaper in Shanghai, and contained neither signature nor date. Therefore, the agreement might only be a preliminary exchange of views. A spokesperson for Wang stated that these were "demands made by the Japanese" and denied that any agreement had been signed with the Japanese side. (Reuters dispatch, 1st)</p>
<h3>Pearl Harbor Defense Commander Wang Zhang; U.S. Should Fortify Guam; No Need to Mind Other Countries' Attitudes; Guam is More Important Than Philippine Harbors</h3>
<p>Washington – Rear Admiral Brooke, Pearl Harbor Defense Commander, declared today at the Women's Patriotic Conference that the United States must decide quickly whether to sever relations with the Philippines, retreat to Guam, or retreat to Hawaii, or remain in the Philippines. If it withdraws from the Philippines, the United States should build Guam into an impregnable stronghold. Because after the United States withdraws from the Philippines, if it does not fortify Guam, the United States will not be able to continue its Open Door Policy in China. Therefore, the current solution is that the United States Navy's proposal to Congress last year to strengthen Guam should be reconsidered by Congress. With one year of work, Guam could gradually have the foundation of a naval base. As for whether other countries consider it a friendly or unfriendly action, there is no need to mind. The question that we should consider is whether it is needed for national defense. If it is needed, then we should engage in fortification at all costs. According to Rear Admiral Brooke, Philippine harbors can only be built into third-class harbors, not as important as Guam. (United Press dispatch, 1st)</p>
<h3>Sir Sassoon Talks About U.S.-Japan Relations</h3>
<p>San Francisco – Shanghai financier Sir Sassoon arrived here yesterday aboard the "President Coolidge." It is said that the abrogation of the U.S.-Japan treaty has given the United States a powerful weapon against Japan. It is difficult to predict how Japan will revive the abolished commercial treaty, as the Japanese side is currently divided into two factions, one advocating the use of force against China, and the other opposing it. However, the current deadlock between the United States and Japan is extremely complicated. Although Japan is bluffing to the United States, the United States is actually in an invincible position, which cannot be intimidated by Japan's bluff. This point is well understood by Japanese businessmen. Sir Sassoon considers rumors of a U.S.-Japan war to be unbelievable, as a war between Japan and the United States would be tantamount to natural death. As for Japan's current hype about the "Asama Maru" incident, it is nothing more than trying to divert public attention from the abrogation of the U.S.-Japan commercial treaty.

<h3>U.S. Army Submits Budget in the House of Representatives</h3>
<p>Washington – U.S. Army Chief of Staff General Marshall presented the Army Department's budget plan at a closed-door session of the House Military Affairs Committee yesterday.

Of this, $300,000,000,000 is for coastal defense expenses, and $650,000,000,000 to $750,000,000,000 is for the expenses of arming 230,000 federal troops and 227,000 national guardsmen.

<h3>Chilean-Japanese Trade Agreement Negotiations Reach Impasse; Stalemate Over Fertilizer Issue</h3>
<p>Santiago – It is reported that the Chilean-Japanese trade agreement has been agreed upon, except for the fertilizer issue. For example, Japan agrees to pay cash for Chilean copper exports, but for Chile's other exports, payment must be made with Japanese goods. As for the issue of Chilean fertilizer, the two sides are still in a stalemate. Chile requires annual fertilizer exports to Japan to be 100,000 tons, but Japan is only willing to accept 30,000 tons, considering anything beyond that unnecessary. Later, the Japanese side made a concession to purchase 50,000 tons, but the Chilean side said that it must purchase at least 70,000 tons. Therefore, negotiations have stalled.

<p>Tokyo – Prime Minister Yonai gave a reply to the questions from Mr. Ogawa Gotaro, a member of the Constitutional Government Party, at a plenary session of the House of Representatives on the 1st. The content is as follows: "In my opinion, if a new central government is established and has the possibility of real power, then that government should be recognized as soon as possible. If Japan resolutely recognizes the 'new government', it will definitely be able to guide third countries to recognize the new government as early as possible within the possible scope. In our policy address, we said that under the determination to consolidate, we will consider the overseas situation and try to exert active forces in order to decisively resolve the situation." The so-called active efforts have two meanings: one is active military efforts, and the other is actively implementing means other than military. (Domei dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>Tokyo – Prime Minister Yonai stated firmly when speaking at the House of Peers today that the Japanese government is determined to concentrate on resolving the China Incident and not to be involved in the whirlpool of the European War. Japan intends to adjust its relations with various countries and firmly maintain its independent position. In order to fulfill the mission of establishing a new order in East Asia based on our beliefs, we must concentrate our strength to increase national power and enhance national defense. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to supplement military preparations and strengthen the wartime national spiritual insurance. (Reuters dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>Tokyo – Finance Minister Sakurada's financial speech at today's formal meeting of the House of Representatives contained the following content: "The recent international situation is extremely complex and subtle, and the future is difficult to predict. Its impact on Japan's finances and economy is by no means superficial. Therefore, it is necessary to pay attention to the development of the situation and seek appropriate measures. The compilation policy for the general account budget for Showa 15 (1940) takes into account the addition of temporary military expenditures, and aims to exert efforts in thrift. Regarding materials, funds, and labor, comparisons are made within the possible scope, and emphasis is placed on achieving the objectives of the incident. Moreover, based on the situation, the replenishment of various indispensable facilities is planned, and at the same time, except for those that are truly urgent and cannot be avoided, other new calculations are generally abandoned. Also, existing expenditures are reduced as much as possible. The newly calculated increases include more than 970 million yen for military replenishment expenses, more than 89 million yen for military personnel support expenses, more than 114 million yen for production capacity expansion expenses, more than 26 million yen for economic control expenses, more than 16 million yen for trade promotion expenses, more than 11 million yen for shipping promotion expenses, more than 15 million yen for civil aviation expenses, and more than 35 million yen for Manchurian pioneers, etc. (omitted)...Also, each special account budget is compiled in accordance with the compilation policy of the general account budget. The increase in revenue is mainly due to the increase in tax revenue after the implementation of tax system reforms. The increase in expenditure is due to the increase in various essential expenditures under the current situation. As for the additional budget for temporary military expenses special account, the additional calculation amount for its expenditure is 2.973 billion yen for the army's temporary military expenses, 737 million yen and 750 million yen for the navy's temporary military expenses, totaling 4.46 billion yen. Its financial resources are 600 million yen transferred from the general account, more than 160 million yen transferred from the special account, and military expenses, the North China Incident special tax, the price of public sales of goods, and other miscellaneous income of more than 25 million yen, and 3.673 billion yen in public bond income. In the past year, the amount of public bonds issued reached 5.281 billion yen, and the amount of convertible bank notes issued reached 2.376 billion yen, an increase of 4.05 billion yen compared to the average amount issued in the previous year. Since the outbreak of the incident, Japan's prices have continuously shown a tendency to rise. Until the outbreak of the European War last September, the government, fearing that Japan's prices would be affected by it and tend to rise, took emergency measures, launched the National General Mobilization Law, implemented a complete stop to price increases, adhered to a low-price policy, and sought various measures to promote the smooth supply and demand of materials. Allowing it to better adapt to the actual situation for the necessities of the people's lives, and making every effort to remove the people's anxiety. In the past year, Japan's foreign trade totaled 3.932 billion yen in exports and 3.127 billion yen in imports, with a trade surplus of 805 million yen. Compared with the previous year, exports increased by 35% and imports increased by 10%. The tail end of its trade increased sharply from a trade surplus of more than 60 million yen in the previous year to a trade surplus of 805 million yen last year. The main reason for this leap in exports was the sharp increase in exports to Manchuria and China. There has also been considerable progress in exports to third countries, so it is necessary for us to make every effort to promote exports to third countries in the future. In the past, foreign exchange has always adhered to the market price of two shillings and one penny. However, in October of last year, it was decided to change this British currency benchmark and change it to the US currency benchmark, with a market price of 23 yen and 16.7 cents against the US dollar as the level of Japan's exchange rate market. As a result of this change in benchmark, the external value of the Japanese currency, which has an extremely important relationship with trade prices and other aspects, has gained new stability from this point on. The government's future policy will continue to seek various measures to promote the suitability of the international balance of payments in order to maintain this exchange rate level. (Domei dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>Tokyo – Foreign Minister Arita announced the foreign policy on the parliament seat. First, he stated Japan's relationship with the Soviet Union, saying the Japanese government is constantly seeking to adjust the national relations between Japan and the Soviet Union. Regarding the border issue, what the Japanese government is committed to is not only the border near Nomonghan, but especially to demarcate the overall border between Manchu-Soviet and Mongolia-Manchu, so that it can help prevent disputes. At the same time, seek peaceful resolution of possible disputes near the border. Regarding the trade and economic relations with the Soviet Union, trade and trade agreements are currently being negotiated in Moscow in order to obtain a satisfactory compromise. The decision stated the relationship with Japan, Germany, and Italy. Since the conclusion of the Anti-Comintern Pact, friendship has increased. The Japanese government's anti-communist policy has never changed. In the future, in accordance with this policy, it will always maintain a close relationship with the countries that signed the Anti-Comintern Pact. Next, he said that since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese Incident, the Japanese government has made every effort to make Britain understand the truth of the incident. Recently, the Tianjin Incident has been resolved, and a comprehensive adjustment of relations between the two countries has been sought. The Asama Maru Incident on January 21st this year is now trying to resolve it. The government decided that on July 26 last year, the U.S. government notified Japan to abandon the Japan-U.S. Trade and Navigation Act, which has always served as a wedge in the relations between the two countries since the Meiji 44th year. The main intention of the U.S. government in doing so is obviously to seek to resolve the various problems that have arisen between Japan and the U.S. after the outbreak of the China Incident. Japan has made difficult efforts to try to make the U.S. side thoroughly understand Japan's position. Unfortunately, the trade relationship between Japan and the U.S. finally fell into a treaty-less state after January 26. During this incident, Japan did not want to exclude the just and appropriate rights and interests of the United States and other third countries. During the period of large-scale military operations, in order to protect the rights and interests of third countries in China, no means would be spared. For the damages suffered by the third countries because of the repercussions of military operations, there would also be appropriate consideration. I am sure that the United States and other countries will be enlightened by the progress of the construction of the new order, and that Japan has absolutely no exclusive or monopolistic intentions in the field of economic trade. The state of no treaty can cause the trade relationship and the general state relations to fall into anxiety. This is not what Japan and the United States want. Therefore, the Japanese government hopes that the relations between the two countries will be restored to the normal state with a treaty basis. In the future, we will make extraordinary efforts towards this goal. The decision is that for the South, the Japanese government hopes to cooperate with these places to seek the economic ties and resource development of each place, so as to achieve the goal of coexistence and co-prosperity. According to this purpose, Japan will make extra efforts in the future. Regarding trade, there are currently many countries negotiating, including the United States, the Soviet Union, France, Italy, India, and Central and South America. When the European War broke out last September, the Japanese government declared to the world that it would not participate in the European War, but would devote itself to handling the China Incident. Since then, it has always adhered to this policy of not joining. (Domei)</p>
<h3>Japanese Army and Navy Submit Huge Military Expansion Budget; Totaling 10,000,000,000 Yen</h3>
<p>Tokyo – According to news from here today, in order to expedite the resolution of the war in China and to deal with the interference of third countries, the Japanese Army and Navy declared today that they are requesting the Diet to approve a budget of 10,000,000,000 yen to implement a six-year military reorganization plan. Of this, the army needs 4,413,878,000 yen to strengthen national defense, reorganize the air force, and seek improvements in military equipment. The navy is requesting 5,403,486,000 yen to build ships, increase dock facilities, renovate old equipment, and add naval aircraft. As the Diet had previously approved 2,052,638,000 yen for strengthening national defense expenditures, it is only requesting 1,120,000,000 yen from the Diet currently assembled, totaling 3,171,438,000 yen, to be used over four years beginning in the next fiscal year on April 1st. As for the re-enrichment of army aircraft, the previous mountain congress had approved 503,767,000 yen, so the army is now only requesting 922,254,000 yen, totaling 1,426,022,000 yen.

<h3>Daily News: Various Japanese Political Parties Strive to Revive Their Political Lives; Consistently Dissatisfied with the Arrogance of the Army</h3>
<p>Tokyo: The 75th Japanese Diet recently reconvened today. General observers believe that if the previous Abe cabinet were still in power and attending the House of Representatives, it would be like encountering a great storm at sea. The current Yonai cabinet is in a more favorable situation, and the storms are expected to be calmer. However, various political parties have been forced to remain behind the scenes of the political stage for nearly a decade. They played a decisive role in the downfall of the Abe cabinet, and they will inevitably find ways to prove that they have rejoined Japanese political life. Therefore, in the weeks following the opening of the House of Representatives, many members of each party will likely express themselves frankly. It can be asserted that:</p>
<p>Regarding the</p>
<p>Constitutional Democratic Party (Minseito)</p>
<p>Since two of its representatives have joined the cabinet, the party has now decided to openly support the Yonai cabinet. However, according to the Asahi Shimbun, the general party members of the Minseito feel dissatisfied with the current state of relations between the national defense departments and the government. Consequently, they have become indifferent to the current cabinet.</p>
<p>Regarding the</p>
<p>Seiyukai</p>
<p>Although internally divided into two factions, they unanimously acknowledge that they must wait for the Yonai cabinet to take action before judging it, and have decided to support both factions to some extent. Some members believe that the Yonai cabinet leans toward "status quo," resembling the previous Abe cabinet. As for the small political parties, they are actively promoting "reform" ideology and often openly criticize moderate cabinets. Therefore, although the number of members in each party is small, their attitude is noteworthy. Among them, the</p>
<p>Social Masses Party</p>
<p>claims to be Japan's only labor party and is the only party openly opposing the Yonai cabinet. A spokesperson for the party is reportedly preparing to raise bold questions about the current cabinet's economic policies and intends to advocate for the thorough implementation of anti-capitalist reforms. Then there's the pro-fascist</p>
<p>Tohokai (East Society)</p>
<p>which was extremely active during the Japanese military authorities' blockade of the British concession in Tianjin last year. Recently, after the "Asama Maru" incident, it has also been actively engaged in anti-British propaganda. If the current cabinet pursues pro-British or pro-American policies, the society may come out in opposition. In short, Japanese political parties have not yet gained sufficient power to independently form a cabinet or overthrow one. Therefore, their position is only enough to represent an active force behind the political scene. By observing the criticisms or encouragements issued by each party, one can glimpse whether this force opposes or supports the cabinet. As for the policies of the new cabinet, Prime Minister Yonai once stated that the policy direction centers on three matters: handling the China Incident, adjusting international relations, and improving the domestic situation. Judging from the current situation, Prime Minister Yonai may not find it easy to handle the aforementioned three matters. Regarding the</p>
<p>China Problem</p>
<p>The results of the Qingdao Conference, as reported by various newspapers, contain some contradictions. According to the recent Daily News, all sectors in Japan are now demanding that the content of the understanding between Japan and the Wang Jingwei regime be made public. The so-called "all sectors" likely refers to people in the economic and financial sectors, as they mostly eagerly hope that the China Incident can be resolved as soon as possible, so that the new order presided over by Wang Jingwei can bring them substantial benefits. According to the Daily News' speculation, Prime Minister Yonai will likely gloss over this issue in his speech to the House of Representatives today, because the government believes there are various reasons why it is not appropriate to announce the conditions accepted by Wang Jingwei at this time. Regarding the issue of adjusting international relations, Prime Minister Yonai will inevitably encounter various difficulties. The signs can be seen from the internal circumstances of the new cabinet's formation. Those in Japan who previously advocated establishing an alliance treaty with Germany and Italy were mostly from the army. These people are currently closely watching all of Prime Minister Yonai's diplomatic measures. The new cabinet inherited the "independent diplomacy" slogan advocated by the Abe cabinet at the beginning of its tenure. The original meaning was "Japan does not want to accept further constraints from the Axis powers (i.e., Germany and Italy) in the future." However, nationalists and supporters of the army have recently proposed a new interpretation, saying, "If Prime Minister Yonai declares to us that the government has no choice but to establish a compromise plan with Britain and the United States, then we can only request the Soviet Union as an intermediary between Japan and Germany and promote a new type of pro-German policy to counteract it." In addition, the strong reaction triggered in Japan after the "Asama Maru" incident was, according to many observers, beyond the expectations of the Yonai cabinet. It is said that Foreign Minister Arita initially did not intend to raise much objection and was preparing to resolve it quickly. However, the anti-British groups, which had received thorough training during the Tianjin problem last year, took the opportunity to warn Prime Minister Yonai, saying that they were watching the case intently to prevent the government from softening its policy towards Britain. The active role of the forces behind Japanese political parties on international issues is another clear proof of this. As for improving the</p>
<p>Domestic Situation</p>
<p>In particular, regarding the economy and budget, the army has not yet put forward any concrete suggestions to solve the current urgent problems. This is different from what happened after the formation of previous cabinets and is the most noteworthy point of the current situation. According to the Asahi Shimbun, Army Minister Hata has maintained a wait-and-see attitude and has not yet asked Prime Minister Yonai to accommodate the army's views. The army believes that various fundamental issues have already been resolved in principle by adopting unchangeable resolutions, and it is only necessary to implement these fundamental resolutions. The army has no need to interfere. At the same time, it also stated that reforming and strengthening the domestic front are prerequisites for resolving the Sino-Japanese War. Therefore, all domestic political issues are still of great concern to the army. Some moderates are reportedly not entirely satisfied with the army's attitude, saying that the army has repeatedly assumed responsibility to the nation to resolve the China Incident. In fact, the army should not only bear general responsibility but should also bear responsibility jointly with the cabinet on a daily basis. Regarding this, some members may raise questions after the opening of the House of Representatives to find out the army's place in Japanese political life. It is also reported that Minseito member Saito (known for his eloquence, who gave a speech before the February 26 Incident in Tokyo in 1936, fiercely attacking militarism) is currently drafting a speech to express the views of moderates to the House of Representatives.

<h3>Japanese Navy Recovers Sunken Submarine</h3>
<p>Tokyo: According to a statement released by the Navy Department today, the Japanese submarine I-63, which sank in the Peng-hu Strait near Tsushima in February 1939 after being rammed, has been recovered by the Navy salvage team today after a year of hard work and floated back to the surface. The aforementioned tragedy occurred in a foggy morning during exercises, resulting in the deaths of nine officers and seventy-two sailors. Salvage operations were immediately carried out at the time, but due to the rapid currents and the submarine sinking to a depth of 100 meters, they were unsuccessful. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>

<h3>British Prime Minister's Speech: Determined to Fight for Freedom; Hopes to Restore Normal International Trade; Does Not Ask About Neutral Countries Joining the War</h3>
<p>London: British Prime Minister Chamberlain said in a speech at the Dorset Hotel yesterday, "Neutral countries have the right to decide whether or not to join the war. We do not want to question it. However, we ask them to consider that although we have the right to exercise belligerent rights, or may cause inconvenience or loss to them, we have never sunk neutral ships, nor have we ever intended to sacrifice the lives of neutral people. The enemy is not like that. They threaten the survival of countries that are too weak or too close to resist. I firmly believe that the sentiments and ultimate interests of neutral countries must be placed on the side of those who strive to maintain the rights of nations and individuals, so that they can live in peace without fear of aggression and oppression. Britain and France will continue to fight until the ravaged freedom has been restored and both friends and enemies can gather in one room to build a more pleasant and safer world." Chamberlain spoke of the agreement established between Britain and the United States years ago based on the most-favored-nation principle, saying, "After the war, we will definitely want to restore this kind of arrangement. We must eliminate the bad policies of economic nationalism and totalitarianism, because these policies are very harmful to the final great peaceful solution. One of our greatest goals is the restoration of international trade."</p>
<p>British Wartime Production Doubles</p>
<p>The Prime Minister continued to talk about Britain's wartime efforts, saying, "In order to adjust itself to meet its work, Britain has had to revolutionize its industry and the lives of its people. Britain has made arrangements to obtain the raw materials it needs, to purchase all wool produced by the British Empire during the war and for one year after the war. It has now purchased 85 million pounds worth of woolens and leather, and has entered into long-term contracts to obtain supplies of copper, zinc, aluminum, rubber, hemp, and flax. At the beginning of the war, there were nine companies in Britain manufacturing khaki cloth clothing, and now there are more than a thousand. The normal production of military overcoat materials in peacetime was 270,000 yards per month, and now it is 1,500,000 yards per month. The annual production of military uniforms in peacetime was 175,000 sets, and now it is 200,000 sets per month. The annual purchase of army leather boots in peacetime was 120,000 pairs, and now it is 130,000 pairs per week. In 1914, the British Empire's steel production was 9,000,000 tons, and now it produces 18,500,000 tons, of which 14,500,000 tons are produced by Britain. Since the start of the war, the production of various artillery pieces has doubled, and some have increased eightfold, and the production of shells has also doubled compared to the beginning of the war, and has increased tenfold compared to the first five months of the last World War. Since last September, Britain has ordered 200,000,000 pounds worth of military equipment, vehicles, machinery, etc." The Prime Minister also spoke of the need to increase agricultural production, saying that the goal is to increase cultivated land by 2,000,000 acres, which is 1,250,000 acres more than what was already planned. We are now utilizing the services of millions of men and women, taking steps to control tens of millions of tons of materials, and spending hundreds of millions of dollars. We still hope to make greater efforts, but neutral countries are never threatened by this accumulation of enormous power. Now there is one thing that is becoming increasingly clear because of the Germans' own actions, that is, we are fighting for countries that are deeply afraid of following in the footsteps of Czechoslovakia, Poland, and today's Finland." (Reuters, 1st)</p>
<p>Centralized Management of Merchant Ship Construction</p>
<p>London: Prime Minister Chamberlain recently announced in the House of Commons that, in order to concentrate forces, the government has decided to transfer the construction and repair of merchant ships to the jurisdiction of the Admiralty from February 1, following the practice of the last European War, so that on the one hand, the utilization of all shipbuilding materials can be unified, and on the other hand, greater flexibility can be obtained in adapting to the needs of shipping. The government will also appoint the famous shipbuilding expert Sir Lithgow as the Director-General of Merchant Ship Construction and Repair at the Admiralty, and another expert, Eyre, as the Director. The Admiralty will subsequently consult with shipowners regarding the types of merchant ships to be built before making a decision, in order to meet the needs. (Havás News Agency, 31st)</p>
<p>US Secretary of State Expresses Satisfaction</p>
<p>Washington: British Prime Minister Chamberlain expressed his hope for the restoration of normal international trade in his speech yesterday. Secretary of State Hull expressed satisfaction to the press, saying, "My commercial policy is to prevent the major powers from competing for self-sufficiency and totalitarian economic systems. I firmly believe that more and more countries are accepting this policy, but I still hope that all countries will adopt it unanimously in a short period of time." In addition, diplomatic circles also expressed satisfaction with Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech, affirming that it was about Britain striving to take into account the interests of neutral countries, and said that the fundamental policy explained by the Sea Secretary Churchill had not changed, but judging from what Chamberlain said today, it can be seen that the country is still willing to specially take care of the interests of neutral countries during the war.

<h3>Netherlands Appeals to People of All Countries to Help in the War; Mannerheim Line Sufficient to Resist Threats; Siberian Ski Team Joins the War</h3>
<p>London: A Finnish spokesperson in London told a Reuters reporter last night that, looking at the situation after the first two months of the Soviet-Finnish War, the Soviet military's main objectives in Finland were three: (1) to break through Finland's main fortress line, the Mannerheim Line, or, if they could not break through it head-on, to flank it; (2) to cut Finland's "waist" into two sections; (3) to occupy Petsamo and its hinterland, making naval assistance impossible and cutting off maritime supplies. At present, this threat has been contained on all fronts. Finnish staff officers believe that the Mannerheim Line can withstand even stronger pressure than before. What Finland needs most urgently now is more ammunition and weapons, including aircraft, and manpower is also needed. Finland can contain the Soviet army for a long time, but the final outcome depends on manpower. Finland now appeals to people from all countries who want to uphold the ideals for which Finland is fighting to come and help in the war. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>

<h3>British and French Experts Investigate Romania's Oil Production and Sales Situation; Quantity Supplied to Germany Does Not Exceed the Agreed Limit; Oil Committee Chairman Litar Takes Office</h3>
<p>London: The British and French governments recently jointly dispatched many experts to investigate Romania's oil production and sales situation in order to decide what attitude to take towards the country. It is expected that these experts will submit a report tomorrow. According to well-informed sources here, the current problem is extremely complex, because the German-Romanian economic agreement stipulates that Romania should supply Germany with 120,000 tons of oil per month, but so far, the actual amount of oil shipped to Germany is far below this agreed amount. There are two reasons for this: one is the difficulty of transportation between Germany and Romania, and the other is that most Romanian oil companies are capitalized by British and French funds, and they naturally have concerns about supplying Germany. Until recently, the Romanian government decided to establish a National Oil Committee to control the production and distribution of oil nationwide. According to the explanation given by the Romanian authorities, the German government often said that Romanian oil companies were deliberately delaying deliveries at the instigation of Britain and France, and therefore complained repeatedly. The Romanian government's control of the production and sales of oil nationwide will leave Germany with no excuse. The British and French governments, on the other hand, believe that Romania's security is guaranteed by Britain and France, and that the majority of oil companies in the country are capitalized by British and French funds. If these companies supply the enemy with a large amount of oil, it is difficult to turn a blind eye. Therefore, Britain and France once stopped transporting certain goods purchased by Romania, especially those used for national defense, to show their protest. The Romanian government immediately expressed its sincerity to Britain and France and guaranteed that the oil it supplied to Germany would never exceed the amount stipulated in the German-Romanian economic agreement. Since Britain and France maintain friendly relations with Romania, they will not make a hasty decision before the experts' report is submitted. In short, Romania is in a difficult situation because it has already signed an economic agreement with Germany, and this is understood by Britain and France. Therefore, Britain and France may not object to the amount of oil Romania supplies to Germany as long as it does not exceed the amount stipulated in the agreement, but will only require Romania not to exceed this limit. However, from a purely legal point of view, Britain and France can still exercise their belligerent rights and prevent Romanian oil from being shipped to Germany in any way, even if it is the amount stipulated in the German-Romanian agreement.

<h3>Balkan Conference Opens Today; Focuses on Neutrality Issue</h3>
<p>Yugoslav Capital: The Balkan Conference will open on the 2nd and has decided to have Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu as chairman. Therefore, the proceedings will only be known after Foreign Minister Gafencu arrives here. It is understood that the foreign ministers of the four Balkan countries plan to hold two meetings every day, one at 10:00 am and one at 5:00 pm. By the 4th of this month, the chairman will issue a press release to journalists regarding the conference. At the same time, a Balkan intelligence conference will be held, and Turkey, Greece, Yugoslavia, and Romania have all sent representatives. (Haitong News Agency, 1st)</p>
<p>Yugoslav Capital: Regarding the Balkan consultation held here, foreign countries believe that the importance of this meeting lies in proving the existence of the Balkan countries as an element of European peace and order, and at the same time demonstrating the determination of the Balkan countries to jointly maintain neutrality. Politicians in South Korea, on the other hand, say that the meeting has no important decisions and that no issues of territorial revision will be raised. They say that the absence of Bulgaria and Hungary proves that the issue of territorial revision will not be raised. Eastern Bulgaria also declared that because Bulgaria is not a member of the Balkan consultation, it is not convenient to make demands on it, but believes that future demands will not endanger Balkan peace. Turkey is well aware that the foreign ministers of other countries will criticize Turkey's pro-British and French attitude and discuss the tense relationship between Italy and Turkey. Greek Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Metaxas will declare his determination to maintain neutrality. (Haitong News Agency, 1st)</p>
<p>Yugoslav Capital: According to sources here, the agenda of the Balkan consultation is roughly as follows: (1) To hear reports from the four foreign ministers on diplomatic activities in recent years. (2) To discuss the relationship between the Balkan consultation and the major powers, especially the belligerent countries. (3) To discuss the relationship between the countries of the Balkan consultation and their neighbors, especially Hungary and Bulgaria, as well as the issue of Italy and Yugoslavia acting as mediators between Hungary, Bulgaria, and the Balkan countries. (4) To discuss the economic issues of the four countries of the Balkan consultation. (Haitong News Agency, 1st)</p>
<p>Yugoslav Capital: Because Germany requested Southeast European countries to explain their attitude in economic terms on the eve of the Balkan Conference, the conference has become even more important. This move by Germany has aroused a unanimous demand for joint cooperation among the Balkan countries, the organization of a strong group, and the enhancement of political independence when taking action against the belligerent countries.

<h3>South Road, Guangdong Province: Chinese Army Counter-Offensive at Qinzhou and Fangcheng; Charging into the City after Crossing the Qin River; Recapturing Fangcheng, Japanese Troops Retreat to Qisha</h3>
<p>A dispatch from Zhaoqing reports that when the Japanese troops entrenched in Guangdong Province launched a northern offensive towards Yingde and Wengyuan, the Chinese army on the southern front, in order to coordinate with the northern front's counter-offensive, also launched a fierce attack on the Qin-Yong Highway on the 2nd by the armies and divisions of Huang, Chen, and Deng. The Guizhou Provincial army also attacked Wucun, Huaxu, Datang, and other places on the south bank of the Yu River. The Japanese troops, unable to attend to both fronts, were in a difficult position, and were forced into a corner, disregarding international law and using poison gas to obstruct the Chinese army's advance. A full-scale bloody battle erupted on the Qin-Yong Highway. The Chinese army, one after another, charged forward, racing across the Japanese positions from morning till night. The Chinese army's mechanized units also joined the battle, exerting their power to the fullest, inflicting great damage on the Japanese troops. After twelve hours of fierce fighting, all the Japanese troops on the east bank of the Pingyin River were driven back to Qinzhou. The suburbs of Xiaodong and Dagou were immediately stormed by the Chinese army, resulting in eight hours of melee, causing the Japanese troops to abandon their weapons and ammunition and flee in disarray. On the 3rd, the Chinese army crossed the Pingyin River and continued to attack the Japanese troops at Dagou. Many of the Japanese troops' fortifications were destroyed by artillery fire. Japanese planes bombed and strafed the Chinese army's positions in batches throughout the day to hinder the Chinese army's advance, making the battle intense. On the evening of the 4th, a Chinese army light cavalry unit suddenly made a roundabout advance and attacked Qinzhou, charging into the city. The Japanese troops defending the city were caught off guard and scattered in all directions, with sixty to seventy being killed. The whole city was in chaos. The Chinese army went straight to the Japanese army headquarters, seizing many important documents, and set the headquarters on fire. When the Japanese troops regained their composure, they reorganized and counter-attacked the Chinese army. The Chinese army then took control of all the strategic locations in the city and resisted them. After a long period of fierce fighting, the number of Japanese troops increased, threatening to encircle the Chinese army. Seeing that their objective had been achieved, and without reinforcements, the Chinese army could not sustain the battle, and therefore, in the dark of night, cut a bloody path to the northwest corner, broke through the Japanese army's encirclement, and safely reached a certain location. When the Chinese army was about to withdraw, they engaged in street fighting with the Japanese troops. The Chinese army that attacked Qinzhou was commanded by Wang Dinghua. Wang has now reported the process of the attack to his superiors.</p>
<p>Furthermore, after the Chinese army advanced to the east bank of the Qin River, they continuously used their artillery to exert their power, fiercely bombarding the Japanese positions at Longzhen, Changningzhai, and other places on the northwest bank. The Japanese troops' fortifications on the west bank were largely destroyed by the bombardment. On the 10th and 11th, the Japanese troops also returned fire, resulting in intense artillery battles between the two sides. Artillery fire could be heard all day long in Nali, Guanglong, Xinlong, and other places. At 9 a.m. on the 10th, over three hundred Japanese infantry and cavalry attacked Naxi in an attempt to outflank the Chinese army, but were intercepted by the Chinese army, resulting in a fierce battle. After three hours of fighting, the Japanese unit suffered more than half casualties and was finally defeated. On the 10th, 12th, 13th, and 14th, Japanese reinforcements were found landing in the Qinzhou Bay area, accompanied by large numbers of war horses and military equipment and ammunition. At present, Qinzhou is full of Japanese troops, and even the slightly intact merchants and temples have been occupied. Every night, reinforcements are secretly transported north along the Qin-Yong Highway. The transport route is along the road from Dasi to Najiannaqu, connecting to the Datang Highway, and is often patrolled and protected by Japanese planes to prevent interception by the Chinese army and civilians.</p>
<p>The Chinese mobile units around Qinzhou are extremely active, making great efforts to cut off the Japanese army's transportation and continuously destroying the Qin-Yong Highway. The Japanese troops repair it and it is destroyed again. On the 12th, a certain unit of the Chinese army launched a night attack on Xiaodong. The Japanese troops were awakened in the middle of the night and resisted desperately, even setting fire to villages in the northeastern suburbs to cover their defense. However, the Chinese army used their familiarity with the terrain and calmly attacked, engaging in a fierce battle with the Japanese troops for more than three hours before retreating to their original positions. The result of the night attack was the burning of more than ten Japanese military vehicles parked on the highway. The military vehicles were all loaded with gasoline and military supplies. In addition, over a hundred Japanese troops were killed, resulting in significant losses. At 10 a.m. on the 12th, over two hundred Japanese infantry troops besieged in Qinzhou dispatched more than twenty civilian boats, crossing the Qin River from Niugang, and attempting to make a roundabout sneak attack on Longtouxu, with a plane providing cover. The Chinese troops and civilians, upon receiving the report, defended Longtouxu Taishan and engaged in battle. After several hours of fierce fighting, the Japanese troops, despite the cover of the plane, were unable to advance. At 2 p.m., they retreated to the north bank of the Qin River. On the morning of the 14th, several hundred Japanese infantry and cavalry attacked eastward along the Qinzhou-Lingshan Highway, and were intercepted by the Chinese army near Pingji. The two sides engaged in fierce fighting, resulting in over a hundred Japanese casualties. The Chinese army captured one artillery piece, over ten rifles, and two war horses. In addition, Japanese troops in Xiaodong, Dagang, and other places were also restless. Furthermore, on the 12th and 13th, Chinese air squadrons flew to various places in Qinzhou to scout and survey the Japanese troops' situation. At dawn on the 14th, a Chinese air squadron bombed the Japanese troops along the Qin-Yong Highway and encountered nine Japanese planes over Changtan in northern Qinzhou, resulting in a fierce air battle that lasted for over twenty minutes. The Japanese planes were finally defeated and flew west to return to their unit. At that time, villagers in the Changtan area heard the dense machine gun fire of the Chinese planes attacking the Japanese planes. According to reports from the front lines of Pingji, during the Chinese-Japanese air battle, one Japanese plane was hit by a Chinese plane, caught fire, and crashed in the mountains between Xinpingxu and Nazhaxu. A telegram has been sent to all parties to search for it. In the Fangcheng area, since the Chinese army recaptured the county seat, the Japanese troops retreated and gathered in the Dacun and Qisha areas, with an estimated three hundred or so remaining. The Japanese troops in Qinzhou were unable to deploy reinforcements. Currently, three Japanese warships are anchored off the coast of Qisha, and there are thirty-four Japanese motorboats in the nearby sea. On the 3rd and 4th, several Japanese planes flew over Fangcheng to scout, but did not drop bombs. Currently, County Magistrate Lin is actively handling post-war matters. County residents who had fled to other places are gradually returning. Since the Japanese troops were driven out of the county seat not long ago, and fearing that the Japanese troops would return, making evacuation difficult, all women and children have been ordered to temporarily delay their return to the city, and the general able-bodied men must also be prepared to evacuate again if necessary. Furthermore, on the evening of the 9th, County Magistrate Lin led two large detachments of militia to launch a night attack on Dacun. The Japanese troops there defended their fortifications stubbornly. The militia repeatedly charged in the dark, as if entering an uninhabited area. Japanese troops were killed and wounded everywhere and retreated towards Longmensha. The militia, seeing that the goal of annihilating the Japanese troops had been achieved, retreated to their original positions at 3 a.m. on the 10th. That night, over a hundred Japanese troops were annihilated, and two machine guns, over twenty rifles, and one war horse were captured.</p>
<h3>Stable Battle Situation in Taixian: Japanese Troops Attacking Xuanjiabao Repelled</h3>
<p>A dispatch from northern Jiangsu reports that the Japanese troops recently attempted to invade Taixian. Their main force between Yang and Shao has been encircled and attacked by the Chinese army between Yiling and Zhuanqiao, nearly suffering total annihilation. The remaining Japanese troops fled in disarray towards Shaobo, Xiannvmiao, Yangzhou, and other places. Therefore, the Chinese army on the western front has restored its original positions and taken the opportunity to advance, encircling the Japanese troops at Xiannvmiao. As for the Japanese troops at the port, they rely on the cover of their Yangtze River warships and continue to defend stubbornly. The Chinese army, due to the terrain, has not launched a fierce attack for the time being, and the situation has been in a stalemate for days. On the Taixing front, the Japanese troops are still under strict encirclement and surveillance. On the 21st, a small detachment of Japanese cavalry attempted to attack Xuanjiabao, but was met with a head-on attack by the Chinese army, killing a dozen Japanese troops. It is also reported that the order in Taixian has recently recovered slightly, and the morale of the people is gradually stabilizing.</p>
<h3>A Group of Counterfeit Literati in Eastern Guangdong Organize the So-Called "Cultural Promotion Association" Under the Direction of Zou Someone, Acting on Japanese Intentions.</h3>
<p>A dispatch from Shantou reports that the Japanese troops in Chaozhou and Shantou, due to the failure of their military offensive, have changed their strategy to political and economic offensives in order to remedy their plight. As a result, various falsely authorized counterfeit groups have appeared, attempting to numb those with limited knowledge. The old site of the Xinghua Japanese Newspaper on Zhongma Road, along with its printing equipment, has been occupied by the Japanese troops and renamed the "Eastern Guangdong Japanese Newspaper," dedicated to Japanese propaganda. The president is Zou someone, the editor-in-chief is Kong someone, and the main writer is Liu Zhanhong, among others, all of whom are local ruffians. Because they are unable to write, they particularly favor frivolous contributors and often flatter them as "Eastern Guangdong cultural figures." On the 12th of this month, Zou, under the instructions of the Japanese, organized the so-called "Eastern Guangdong Cultural Organization Promotion Association," inviting frivolous contributors to a dinner party on the third floor of the Shantou Hotel (formerly Yongping Hotel). After Zou addressed the attendees, he repeatedly bowed to the Japanese who were present. The Japanese then delivered a speech, and the so-called cultural promotion association was considered to be established. Zou then announced that the promotion association would be temporarily located within the Eastern Guangdong Japanese Newspaper, and that a concert would be established to broadcast Chaozhou music to overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia. Another "painting exhibition" would be established to urge primary and secondary schools to start classes early, etc. Counterfeit groups are thus appearing one after another. As for the initiators of the promotion association, they are the frivolous contributors who attended that day, signing as initiators, including Chen Zongdeng, Zhou Qinhao, Lin Yizi, Li Xian, Wan Jinnian, Wu Xiong, Li Nianxiu, Zheng Jiefu, Murakami Masao, Guo Tiancheng, Sadamatsu Nobuyoshi, Nagashima Masamichi, Gu Xuehui, Shi... Hui, Li Fangbai, Li Tongze, etc.</p>
<h3>Japanese Warships Burn Fishing Boats in Xiangshan Harbor</h3>
<p>A dispatch from Yin County reports that Japanese warships in the Zhejiang Sea have been constantly harassing coastal areas. After shelling Zhenhai, Xiepu, Longshan, and Cixi Guanhaizhen, they continue to prowl and patrol nearby waters. On the morning of the 20th of this month, a grey single-funnel Japanese warship set sail from Tingshuimen outside Zhenhai, and after anchoring briefly off Huangdayang, moved to the foot of Wuyanshan in Xiangshan Harbor. At about 1 p.m., it suddenly lowered a motorboat to search for civilian ships at sea. A fishing boat from Juexi, Xiangshan, was seized, doused with kerosene, and set on fire.</p>
<p>Educational News</p>
<h3>The Revival of Western Zhejiang Education (4)</h3>
<p>Regarding social education, all counties in the rear of the war zone have resumed the work of the People's Education Centers, and other counties have also established mobile education teams, which regularly carry out wartime propaganda and people's education in rural areas. The provincial mobile education teams also have three teams working in western Zhejiang. Due to their superior talent and abundant funds, they naturally gain the faith of the people more smoothly. The establishment of people's schools began in the 29th year, and all counties have large-scale implementation plans. It can be seen that this will leave a memorable war achievement in the history of education in Zhejiang.</p>
<p>The most difficult problem in western Zhejiang education is the lack of teachers. According to statistics from Lin'an County, among the existing 248 primary school teachers, 8 graduated from colleges or universities, 28 graduated from normal schools, 42 graduated or studied at middle schools, 95 graduated or studied at primary schools, and 75 others.</p>
<p>The situation in other counties is roughly the same, or even worse. The task of primary school teachers in the war zone and occupied areas is far more important than that in the rear areas, but the current quality of teachers is so poor, which is indeed a serious problem. It is hoped that qualified teachers in the original war zone can overcome difficulties and maintain this important position. On the one hand, it is hoped that the authorities of all counties will do their best to rectify educational funding and property, and try to increase the salaries of primary school teachers. At the same time, it is hoped that the Department of Education will quickly train teachers, recruit enthusiastic and excellent young people, and assign them to work in various counties to remedy the situation. The Japanese are establishing pseudo-educational institutions on a large scale in the areas they occupy to enslave young people and children. If excellent talents are not assigned to do positive struggle, the situation is very dangerous. (End)</p>

<h3>Second Port Football Match: Huali Team Lineup Announced Yesterday, All Members of Lidu, Extremely Strong</h3>
<p>For the second match of this year's port football match against the Hong Kong representative team, the Huali team has decided to field all members of the Lidu team. The lineup was announced yesterday by the Western Football Association. Except for the absence of right winger Wu Qixiang, who will be replaced by Zhang Mingsheng, the rest of the team is exactly the same as Lidu's A-team lineup. Lidu, with the prestige of winning the last Scott Cup, was promoted to the A-team this year and won all nine games, overwhelming the others. With the battle record of "ever-victorious iron army," they are sure to be able to defeat the mediocre Hong Kong team. However, the appointment of Zhang Mingsheng as right winger is a flaw. The names are listed as follows:</p>

<h3>Qianghua vs. Mailingbai Tonight: Fierce Battle in the Western Youth Basketball League, Feng Nianhua Joins to Help Out</h3>
<p>The Western Youth Basketball League, the A-team match between Qianghua and Mailingbai, was originally scheduled for the night before, but the Western Youth changed the schedule without notifying Qianghua, so they were unaware. This battle is crucial to the championship because the two sides have lost once each. Therefore, the Western Youth decided to reschedule it for tonight at 9:15 p.m. According to the scheduled lineup, the first match tonight at 9:15 was originally Huali vs. Sailing Youth, but since Huali has withdrawn, Shanghai Youth has won two points without effort. It is rumored that one of the players, Go Xu, is returning to the United States, and the hand of the player Si Ge is seriously injured, greatly weakening the strength. Although Qianghua has lost Sun Baoqing, they have newly added Feng Nianhua. Mr. Feng has been working in Hong Kong recently and has been away from Shanghai for a long time. He returned to Shanghai the day before yesterday on a three-month long leave of absence and decided to serve Qianghua again. Mr. Feng arrived in Shanghai at about 8 p.m. the day before yesterday and was greeted by Qianghua captain Chen Xianglong and the Gu Lisen brothers. He immediately stretched his body and prepared for the battle against Mailingbai tonight. The schedule for tonight is as follows:</p>

<h3>Xinliu Cup Table Tennis Quarterfinals: Qingyun A Wins Against Guangdong</h3>
<p>Thirteen Against Six, Guangdong Ranked Second Qingyun and Youbang Scheduled to Decide the Championship</p>
<p>The Xinliu Cup 12th All-Shanghai Team Table Tennis Championship, sponsored by Zhejiang Industrial Bank, was participated in by a total of 75 teams, divided into three groups. The champions and runners-up of the three groups will play in a round-robin tournament to determine who will win the championship. The rankings of the six winning teams, except for Qingyun B, which ranked fourth, Youyou, which ranked fifth, and Wanxia A, which ranked sixth, have been decided. The results of the two teams that were previously locked, Guangong and Youbang, and were to compete in a circle, were changed. The Guangdong team unfortunately lost to Youbang You by twelve to thirteen. For the championship situation, a special change was made. In order to end the competition, the Cup Committee specially invited consultants Chen Linsheng and Ding Du to serve as referees in the hall on the third floor of the bank at 7 p.m. the night before, with the Guangdong team playing against the ever-victorious Qingyun A to hold a rematch. If Guangdong wins Qingyun A, then there is still hope of winning the championship, otherwise it will immediately retreat to third place, and the two teams will continue to send Guangdong into its competition with Qingyun A and Youbang You for the championship. As the Cup Competition invited specially, consultant Chen Linsheng and Ding Du were the two people appointed as referees. Guangdong's powerful players Huang Guanrong and Guo Xiquan were absent, so their strength was greatly affected. With the tournament going on, they were always at a disadvantage. Qingyun, due to the relationship between the finals, the players tried their best to deal with Zhang Ying, who stood out in particular, and it was not easy to win four points. As a result, Qingyun defeated Guangdong by thirteen to six, won the final match, and will be scheduled to face Youbang You to win the championship. The results of both sides are recorded as follows.</p>

<h3>One Yuan Notes, Five Million Arrive, For Account Settlement Use, Ten Cent Notes Reach Five Hundred Thousand</h3>
<p>In order to alleviate the shortage and panic of one-yuan, ten-cent, and subsidiary currency notes in Shanghai, the Ministry of Finance instructed the joint office of the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank of China to find ways to adjust the supply.

<p>Since the National Comforting General Association initiated the Spring Gift Military Support Movement, various regions have enthusiastically responded. Various groups in this city have also organized a fundraising committee to take charge, intending to raise 500,000 yuan as a donation to be sent to the front lines to boost morale. This work officially began yesterday. Various industry associations and major companies and businesses have been actively participating, and it is expected that the results will be considerable. The Municipal Thrift Movement Committee specifically issued a letter to all sectors yesterday, hoping that citizens would enthusiastically contribute and jointly participate in this righteous cause. The original text reads:</p>
<p>They Have No New Year's Eve</p>
<p>"Another year has passed, and it is the end of the year again. People on the isolated island are busy preparing gifts to give to relatives and friends, or buying New Year's goods to prepare for the Spring Festival. In this great era of resistance against Japan, we are still surviving and still have the opportunity to celebrate the New Year. We are truly fortunate in this era. However, for the sake of national independence and the survival of the nation, countless brave soldiers have left their homes and are fighting on the battlefield, braving ice and snow and strong winds, risking their lives to kill the enemy. They have no New Year's Eve, nor Spring Festival. This kind of arduous and extraordinary life, compared to ours, the joys and sorrows in between cannot be measured. Now, the National Comforting Soldiers Committee General Association, in view of this, has specifically initiated the Spring Gift Military Support Movement, advocating the transfer of Spring Festival gifts to the soldiers. All parts of the country have enthusiastically responded. This city has also decided through consultation to start implementing it from the 1st, with the goal of raising 500,000 yuan in donations. This is the least amount of expression that we compatriots in the rear should have for the soldiers who are fighting bloody battles in the icy and snowy weather, and it is also a national duty that everyone should fulfill.</p>
<p>Just Add a Little Frugality</p>
<p>Now the Spring Festival is coming soon. If we, the three million citizens of Shanghai, can each reduce one cent of New Year's spending, we will have 30,000 yuan. However, on average, one person spends far more than one cent. If each person can reduce their spending by ten cents, it will amount to 300,000 yuan. If they use one yuan less, it will amount to 3 million yuan. Therefore, the 500,000 yuan in comforting donations is really not much. Compatriots, as long as we save a little, we will be of great help to the country. In this difficult era, we are already relatively fortunate. If we reduce some or completely save the New Year's spending, it is certainly not a difficult task. For the sake of our country, for the sake of the soldiers on the front lines, I hope everyone will enthusiastically contribute and jointly participate in this righteous cause."</p>
<h3>No Sign of Japanese Troops at Kanshan and Linpu, Shaoxing Telecommunications Restored, Shaoxing Power Plant Unharmed, Kanqian Two Lines Restored, Ningjin Highway Undamaged</h3>
<p>(Special dispatch from this newspaper) According to news from the Shanghai office of the Shaoxing Power Plant, a telegram sent from Shaoxing on the 30th stated, "The city is gradually recovering. The Kanqian two lines have been restored to power. The plant is safe." The Shaoxing Power Plant has a wide business scope, and the two towns of Kanshan (i.e., Kanshan) and Qianqing also have lines. Since the telegram states that the Kanqian two lines have been restored to power, it can be known that there is no more fighting in these two towns. Moreover, previous telegrams from Shaoxing were forwarded through Yuyao. The telegram on the 30th was sent directly from the Shaoxing office, which proves that the Shaoxing market has been restored and the war situation is rapidly stabilizing.</p>
<p>A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency learned from relevant sources yesterday that Shanghai received a telegram from Shaoxing yesterday stating, "Shaoxing city is peaceful. Telephone lines from Shaoxing to Kanshan and Linpu are all open. There is indeed no sign of Japanese troops at Kanshan and Linpu." This proves that Kanshan and other places have been recovered. Shaoxing is peaceful, and rumors circulating outside are unreliable.</p>
<p>Stable War Situation, Smooth Water and Land Transportation</p>
<p>According to the Datong News Agency's inquiries with reliable Shanghai groups from Zhejiang Province, the number of Japanese troops who crossed the river is only a few thousand. A small number are trapped in the county seat of Xiaoshan, and the rest are huddled along the river in Xixing, exhausted and at their wits' end, ready to flee to the north bank at any time. At the same time, the Qianjiang Bridge, after the damaged parts were repaired by the Japanese, was secretly demolished again by the Chinese army. Therefore, their rear and supplies are all in trouble and may be annihilated by the national army. Thus, the new development of the war situation in that area is imminent. Order has been restored in Keqiao, Shaoxing, Baiguan, Shangyu, Yuyao, and other places, and the situation is very stable. The Shangyu County Chamber of Commerce also sent a detailed telegram to the Shaoxing Shanghai Fellow Association to report, asking them to tell their fellow villagers to rest assured, etc. Although Japanese warships are emerging along the coast of Ningbo, there are no unusual movements, and the gap in Zhenhai Port has long been blocked. At present, shipping only terminates outside the port, so there is no need to further block it. Therefore, shipping between Shanghai and Ningbo will not be interrupted. The joint transportation passenger car from Fenghua Creek to Jinhua takes the road through Taizhou and Shengxian, and has no direct impact on the Xiaoshan war, so it is still running as usual.</p>
<p>Ningbo Calm, Highway Not Demolished</p>
<p>The German merchant ship Lihe, which returned from Ningbo to Shanghai, entered the port and arrived at 7:00 a.m. yesterday, carrying more than 1,200 passengers and more than 13,000 pieces of eggs, etc. According to the senior crew member of the ship, Japanese warships used to anchor or patrol outside the port of Zhenhai. Since the fierce battle in Xiaoshan, Japanese warships have rushed to help in the war, and no trace of Japanese warships has been seen outside the port of Zhenhai for many days. Only one ship is anchored in the Xiangshan Port area, but there are no unusual movements either. The rumors circulating in Shanghai that the Japanese army is attempting to land in Zhenhai Longyou and other places have not been heard in Ningbo. Until the Lihe ship left Ningbo for Shanghai the day before yesterday, Japanese warships were never seen. The Ningjin Highway from Ningbo to Jinhua has not been damaged so far and is still open and unobstructed. Moreover, the authorities have no intention of destroying it. However, due to busy military transportation, cargo transportation has been hindered. Also, the weather in Ningbo has been dark and gloomy for several days, so no Japanese planes have invaded. Lihe has postponed its departure to tomorrow, while the Italian merchant ship Baoli has postponed its return to Shanghai to today.</p>
<p>New Regulations for Cargo Transportation at the Ningbo Shipping Office</p>
<p>Cargo transportation between Shanghai and Ningbo is still very frequent recently. The Ningbo Shipping Administration, in order to make adjustments, specially convened a meeting of various shipping merchants a few days ago. It was decided that: (1) When passenger and cargo ships export, they are allowed to carry local goods, with fine goods accounting for 70% and local goods accounting for 30%, based on weight. (2) All ships sailing from Shanghai to Ningbo fully loaded with goods, except those specially permitted by order, must be included in the cargo ship schedule for unloading and transshipment.</p>
<h3>Machinery of Longzhang Paper Mill, All Stolen and Sold, Factory is Investigating</h3>
<p>The Longzhang Paper Mill, located outside Longhua Road, Rihui Bridge, in the Nanshi district, is a large-scale, high-quality manufacturer and a well-known paper mill in our country. After the August 13th Incident, although the important internal machinery was moved to the inland, it had already suffered considerable losses. When Nanshi fell, the factory still had a lot of remaining goods and other machinery and equipment. Unexpectedly, during the Lunar New Year last year, someone colluded with a certain country's ruffian and sold more than 1,000 tons of pig iron, more than 1,000 tons of hot iron, 3,000 bales of rags, more than 1,000 ancestral pieces of cloth paste, one stove, one water intake pump, one large engine, and two small auxiliary coins, all one after another, completely emptying the factory. The estimated value is more than 400,000 yuan. Now, the board of directors and shareholders of the factory are extremely angry about the above situation, and it has been detected that many workers in the factory have obtained the stolen goods and used them for personal gain. An in-depth investigation will be carried out and legal action will be taken.</p>
<h3>New Appointment by the Municipal Council, Probationary Police Barristers</h3>
<p>The Municipal Council has recently appointed Peng Qiji and Fang Huiyi as probationary police barristers, with terms of office starting on February 1 and March 1 of this year, respectively.</p>
<h3>Salvation Army Hosts Various Sectors, Launches Fundraising Campaign, A Certain Gentleman Donates Ten Thousand Yuan Yesterday, Showing Admirable Generosity</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Salvation Army's fundraising campaign was extremely successful. According to Captain Morley, the funds raised have been quite substantial. A certain local person who is enthusiastic about charity and deeply understands the great work of the Salvation Army and provides much assistance to the unfortunate Chinese and foreigners in Shanghai, generously donated 10,000 yuan. Such benevolent and righteous behavior of this gentleman is admirable.</p>
<p>Fundraising Purpose</p>
<p>The goal of this fundraising campaign is to raise 60,000 yuan. Mr. Morley hosted various sectors at the Rotary Club yesterday afternoon, and many of the army's advisors, officers, and their families attended. During the meeting, Rotary Club President Wu Erfu chaired the meeting, and Major General McNaughton, Captain Morley, and Mr. Harry all gave moving speeches.</p>
<p>Arduous Work</p>
<p>The arduous work of the Salvation Army is worth writing about in detail. In the Salvation Army camp in this city, more than 70,000 Chinese refugees have received food, clothing, shelter, and medical care. Thousands of Chinese prisoners, rickshaw pullers, and their families receive assistance from the army every year. The army has specially established training schools for Chinese children and a hostel for unemployed foreigners, so that homeless men can have a place to live. The army headquarters is located at 40 Sassoon House. Donations can be sent there.</p>
<p>Longevity Donations</p>
<p>Our newspaper received a letter yesterday from readers Tang Yuan and his four brothers, stating that they had learned from the newspaper that the Salvation Army was providing food by car every night, benefiting the poor significantly. Therefore, they specially sent all 491 yuan they received for their uncle Jing Seng's 60th birthday to our newspaper for transfer to Brigadier Morales of the Salvation Army to help with the food distribution. Our newspaper has already transferred the full amount on their behalf.</p>
<h3>Low-Priced Rice Sales Temporarily Suspended During the Final Accounting Period, Continued Ordering of Broken Rice Scheduled to Arrive in Shanghai, Group Orders Over 20,000 Bags</h3>
<p>After the Shanghai Low-Priced Rice Committee actively raised funds and handled low-priced rice sales, the first 20,068 bags purchased from the Shanghai market have been completely sold out. The 15,000 bags ordered from Saigon, after arriving in Shanghai in three batches, are now ready to be used for low-priced rice sales. However, during the final accounting period for various industries, it is planned to temporarily suspend low-priced rice sales because the rice shops that are handling the sales are processing their final accounts. As for the 5,000 bags purchased from the Shanghai market for the second time, they are currently piled up in the bank's warehouse. A telegram has been received stating that the continued order of 11,000 bags will arrive in Shanghai on the 10th.</p>
<p>Over 20,000 Bags Registered for Ordering</p>
<p>The People's Food Regulation Association has launched an initiative to order foreign rice in order to suppress the selling price. Various industries in the city have been flocking to the association to obtain registration forms for ordering in order to regulate the food supply for timber workers. Since it began on January 23, thousands of forms have been issued. As of January 30, more than 200 companies have sent the deposit of 20 yuan per bag to the Jin Cheng Bank for collection. The total number of bags ordered is 22,000, and the payment is 340,000 yuan, all of which are registered by the Lixin Accounting Firm.</p>
<p>Foreign Newspaper Observes Saigon Rice Prices</p>
<p>The English-language Da Mei Evening Post reported that the rice price in this city is still very expensive. The business community continues to import rice from Saigon to avoid rice shortages. Six weeks ago, a Japanese spokesman told reporters that the Japanese army, pitying the poor Chinese, planned to transport rice to Shanghai to alleviate their famine, but this promise has not been fulfilled. As for Saigon rice, due to the continued decline in exchange rates and the doubling of shipping costs in the past two months, the price of rice arriving in Shanghai is very expensive. However, merchants continue to purchase it. The retail price of Saigon rice depends on the exchange rate and shipping costs, so the Municipal Council cannot restrict it.</p>
<h3>Inspecting Textile Products, Source of Raw Materials, Review Procedures, Eight Measures</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce previously invited related industries to discuss the procedures for the transportation and sales of domestic silk and satin fabrics and submitted them to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for record. Now, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has replied, "Both of the two generations mentioned in December of the 28th year are understood. The procedures for applying for a national goods certificate for the transportation and sales of domestic yarn and fabric, which were ordered, are intended to investigate the source of raw materials for cotton yarn and fabric and to carefully verify national goods. This is still feasible, but the Chamber of Commerce should still pay special attention to the source of raw materials and whether the trademarks and trade names have any insinuations to prevent fraud. As for the national goods certificate form previously proposed by the Chamber of Commerce, it has been approved by the Ministry. In the future, the certificate form should be uniformly used to avoid discrepancies. Please comply." The document and seal of the Ministry of Economic Affairs are attached with eight measures for the review of the national goods certificate for the transportation and sales of domestic yarn and fabric, as approved. (1) For the transportation and sales of cotton yarn, the transporter and seller shall present the yarn factory's order form or invoice, obtain certification from the Yarn Factory Federation, and then apply to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for verification and issuance. As for the yarn and cloth transported by the yarn factory itself, the yarn factory shall apply to the Yarn Factory Federation for certification, and then the Municipal Chamber of Commerce shall verify and issue the list. Yarn factories that have joined the Municipal Chamber of Commerce as store members may directly apply to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for verification and issuance. (2) Dyeing and weaving factories, knitting factories, etc., that transport and sell the cotton fabrics or knitted goods they produce shall apply to the Machine Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association or the Knitting Industry Association, etc., with the yarn factory's order form or invoice, for review and verification, and then apply to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for verification and issuance of the list. Pure dyeing factories shall also obtain the weaving factory's order form or invoice for inspection. (3) Cotton cloth merchants who transport and sell cotton cloth or cotton fabrics manufactured by the dyeing and weaving factory shall apply to the Cotton Cloth Industry Association with the yarn factory's order form or invoice and the dyeing and weaving factory's order form or invoice.</p>
<h3>Three American Vagrant Youths, All Sentenced to Four Years, Detained for Three Months and Provided Medical Treatment, Efforts to Repatriate Them Will Result in Release</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that three American youths, Evans, Coley (alias Johnson), and McGann, were arrested by the American authorities in this city on Tuesday for vagrancy in Shanghai. Yesterday (January 31) at 11:00 a.m., the American Judge-Advocate in China, Hai Mick,</p>
<p>Opened the Court for Interrogation</p>
<p>According to the three, they left the United States on a Greek ship for Japan and arrived in Yokohama in early October last year. Because they were not used to the hardships of life on board the ship and the food was poor, they landed without seaman's certificates or passport documents. The shipping company did not employ them because they had no seaman's certificates, so they were advised by the American Consulate to take a boat to Shanghai and arrived here on November 4.</p>
<p>Penniless</p>
<p>Mr. Hilbert, the US Attorney, continued to claim that because the three could not support themselves and were wandering aimlessly, they were charged with vagrancy. However, they were not criminals and had not committed any crimes in Shanghai. The judge then asked the three if they pleaded guilty. All three pleaded guilty. Mr. Judson, who is in charge of relief matters for the American Community Fund, also appeared in court, claiming that the Fund had been</p>
<p>Helping the Three</p>
<p>since October 4. Now the three urgently want to return to their country. The only way is to cooperate with the Navy. However, two of the three are ill, and the Navy may not agree to take them back. Thereupon, Judge Hai Mick declared that his best intention was to send the three to Ward Road</p>
<p>Western Prison</p>
<p>and provide immediate medical treatment. Through the efforts of the American community and government agencies, they should be able to send them back to their country. He sentenced the three to bail of 200 yuan each, sent to Ward Road Western Prison, and sentenced them to no more than three months of detention. During this period, they will be released as soon as it is possible to send them back to their country.</p>
<p>Reviewed and Verified</p>
<p>After that, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce will verify and issue it. (4) In order to make the procedures complete and thorough, the order forms or invoices mentioned in Articles 2 and 3 above may be sent in advance by the persons applying for the certificate to the industry association for verification and registration, and then transferred to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for registration, and a seal shall be affixed to each. (5) The Machine Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association, the Knitting Industry Association, the Cotton Cloth Industry Association, etc., shall inspect the applicant's</p>
<p>Actual Sales Volume</p>
<p>and remove the amount of yarn used or cloth sold from the registered order form or invoice to show solemnity. (6) The certificate issued by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce shall be filled in according to the form approved by the Ministry of Economic Affairs. (7) For goods woven from yarn produced by foreign merchants, or for yarn and cloth produced by foreign merchants, which are transported and sold after being processed, printed, and dyed by domestic factories, the applicant may apply for a certificate in accordance with these measures with the order form or invoice of the foreign yarn factory or dyeing and weaving factory. (8) The valid period of the order form or invoice of the yarn factory, dyeing factory, or weaving factory shall be limited to one year and six months from the date of the order or invoice.</p>
<h3>NYK Liner Terukuni Maru, Passage After Striking a Mine in England, Survivors Arrive in Shanghai and Detail Their Experience, Passengers Lowered Safely and Orderly</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that the NYK liner Terukuni Maru, weighing 11,920 tons, sank off the coast of England on November 21 last year after striking a mine, becoming the first Japanese ship to be lost in the European War. Of the survivors, 108 embarked on the NYK liner Suwa Maru from London on December 8 to return to Japan. They arrived in Shanghai at 10:30 a.m. yesterday (January 31) and berthed at the Dalian Shipping Company wharf in Yangshupu. It is scheduled to leave Shanghai at 4:00 p.m. today (February 1) to continue its voyage back to Japan.</p>
<p>Sailing from Morocco to London</p>
<p>Mr. Kawai, the first-class purser of the Terukuni Maru, also returned to his country on the Suwa Maru. When he arrived in Shanghai yesterday, he told reporters that the Terukuni Maru set sail from Casablanca, Morocco, on November 13 for London, carrying 28 passengers, 208 crew members, and 5,100 tons of cargo. On the way, it encountered the Japanese ship Jizaki Maru, which sent a radio message warning the Terukuni Maru that there were one or two floating mines going north.</p>
<p>Terrible Explosion Suddenly at the Stern</p>
<p>On November 20, the Terukuni Maru entered a British-controlled port and obtained a navigation chart issued by the British Admiralty, which designated the Terukuni Maru's route. The next morning, the Terukuni Maru sailed out of the controlled port with a British pilot on board. At that time, he (Kawai) and Captain Matsukura were both on the bridge. Matsukura was closely watching the sea with a pair of binoculars. At about 12:30 p.m., a terrible explosion was suddenly heard from the stern. He was knocked to the deck by the shock.</p>
<p>Passengers Dined and Heard the Warning and Left Their Cabins</p>
<p>Looking towards the stern, he saw the cargo hatch cover flying up, the seawater being shocked, and the spray splashing, reaching the top of the mast. The Terukuni Maru was hit by a mine on the port side of the second and third cabins. At that time, the passengers in first class were having lunch. Hearing the sound and knowing that they were in danger, they left their cabins one after another to await escape, but the order was orderly and there was no panic.</p>
<p>Each Boat First Carried the Captain</p>
<p>The first lifeboats lowered carried women and children. A total of eight lifeboats were lowered one after another, and the passengers and crew were all rescued. Captain Matsukura was in the last lifeboat. Looking back at the Terukuni Maru, it gradually sank. Several passengers were seriously injured, but none were in danger of life. If the Terukuni Maru had been older, the casualties would have been much greater.</p>
<h3>Food Shortage in Hangzhou, Urgent Need for Relief</h3>
<p>Recently, there has been an extreme shortage of food in Hangzhou. It is said that there are more than 70,000 unemployed workers and homeless people in the local area who cannot survive without relief. Mr. Xu, a merchant from Hangzhou, has invited the China Moral Society, the Red and Yellow Swastika Societies, and the China Jisheng Society to raise funds and rush to provide emergency relief. They have already started to select the neediest to distribute relief to alleviate the immediate crisis. However, there are too many monks and too little porridge, which is only enough for a few days of food. It is hoped that benevolent people will work together to help and accumulate immeasurable merit. The temporary office is temporarily located in the Jisheng Society.</p>
<h3>Import and Export of Goods in Yantai, Licenses Temporarily Revoked</h3>
<p>The Mainland News reported that reliable sources from Yantai, Shandong, informed them last night (January 31) that the Japanese side has revoked the license system for all import and export goods passing through Yantai, which severely hindered foreign trade in the area, starting on January 18. The reason is unknown. The revocation of this system is truly good news for foreign merchants in Yantai. However, the Japanese authorities still carefully search all goods entering the port to prevent supplies from reaching the guerrillas in the interior. Therefore, the transportation of goods from Yantai to the interior still requires the permission of the Japanese authorities.</p>

<h3>Two to Three Hundred Chinese and Western Detectives in Fierce Battle with Violent Robbers Last Night; Yongda Cotton Shop on Shanxi Road Robbed; Violent Robbers Resist Arrest, Exchanging Hundreds of Shots; Two Robbers Killed, Five Captured Alive, Western Detective Sergeant Seriously Wounded</h3>
<p>Last night around 7:00 PM, over ten ferocious robbers armed with Mauser pistols suddenly broke into the Yongda Cotton Shop at No. 14 Zhongde Lane on Shanxi Road in the Public Concession, intending to intimidate and rob. The audacity of the robbers to act in such a place, given the well-defended Concession police and the bustling area, makes this robbery a major case unprecedented in recent years in this city. Subsequently, the police immediately dispatched two to three hundred detectives to encircle and capture them. After several hours of searching, two robbers were killed and five were captured alive. Some Chinese and Western detectives were also injured. Shanxi Road was like a war zone for a time, and the situation was quite tense. Even by 3:00 AM this morning, hundreds of Chinese and Western detectives were still conducting a tight encirclement and search. Details of the events are recorded below:</p>
<p>Violent Robbers Rob Yongda Cotton Shop</p>
<p>The Yongda Cotton Shop is owned by Zhang Ziyu, a native of Hubei Province. In recent years, business has been quite successful. The robbers, hearing that Zhang had accumulated considerable wealth through his business acumen, harbored malicious intentions. At 7:00 PM last night, when Shanxi Road was teeming with people, more than ten robbers infiltrated Zhongde Lane from the crowd. The lane is located between Ningbo Road and Beijing Road, and the Yongda Cotton Shop is the first establishment in the lane. Its main gate is a shikumen (stone gate), and it usually has considerable security. Last night, the robbers infiltrated, with a large number of people and many armed with weapons, allowing them to successively break into the lane.</p>
<p>Six Police Cars Conducted Tight Encirclement</p>
<p>After the robbers arrived at the shop, the staff, seeing the seriousness of the situation, immediately pressed the alarm bell. Upon hearing the alarm, the police immediately dispatched a large number of police vehicles. Chinese, Western, and Indian detectives arrived one after another. This reporter, upon hearing the news, also rushed to investigate. I saw two red police vehicles parked on Ningbo Road, Shandong Road, Shanxi Road, and Beijing Road, totaling as many as six vehicles. In addition, many police cars also arrived at the scene. At each intersection and on Shanxi Road, there were two to three hundred Western, Chinese, and Indian detectives armed with guns, creating a tense atmosphere. This was a unique deployment in the Concession's robbery cases.</p>
<p>Violent Robbers Resist Arrest, Resembling Street Warfare</p>
<p>Amidst the heavily guarded area, the reporter learned that after the robbers rushed into the shop, they used weapons to intimidate key staff, ordering them to hand over their valuables, and then looted indiscriminately. The exact amount of the loss is still unknown because the shop owner could not be reached. Just as the robbers were about to finish their looting and were rushing out the door, the police vehicles dispatched by the Old Zhabei and Central Police Stations had arrived. Detectives immediately issued a warning, ordering the robbers to stop. Seeing the unfavorable situation, the robbers attempted to flee in all directions. Detectives immediately opened fire. The robbers also returned fire with Mauser pistols. Bullets flew everywhere, and the two sides exchanged hundreds of shots. Some detectives even climbed onto nearby rooftops to engage the robbers. Nearby residents, suddenly hearing the continuous gunfire, were quite frightened. Residents living in the vicinity who were returning home were prevented from passing. Men, women, old, and young, whispered to each other, with looks of worry on their faces.</p>
<p>Two Robbers Killed, Western Detective Seriously Wounded</p>
<p>The reporter then went to Beijing Road and saw more than sixty Indian detectives armed with Mauser rifles standing guard on the road. Western detectives, all wearing steel-mesh vests, were rushing back and forth, extremely busy. Later, amidst the intermittent gunfire, I went to Zhongde Lane and saw two robbers who had been killed lying at the entrance of the lane, their bodies riddled with bullets, resembling beehives. A mountain ambulance took them to the police hospital. During the fierce battle, Detective Sergeant Moore was shot in the arm and suffered minor injuries due to his brave attempt to capture the robbers. Western Detective Kirk of Sandao Street suffered serious head and neck injuries and was also taken to the Gongji Hospital for treatment. In addition, it was reported that several Chinese detectives were also injured.</p>
<p>Five Robbers Captured Alive with Tear Gas</p>
<p>As of 1:30 AM when this reporter was drafting this report, in addition to the two robbers killed, five more were captured alive after detectives dispersed tear gas. Mauser pistols with live ammunition and eight suspects were also seized. The remaining robbers, armed with weapons, fled into various households in the lane. The police decided to round up all these robbers and searched through the night without any slackening, while also interrogating the captured robbers in detail, hoping to quickly and completely clarify the case.</p>
<h3>Special Dispatch This Morning: Standoff Continued Until Dawn</h3>
<p>At 3:20 AM this morning, this reporter received reliable information that the robbers were still holding out against the detectives in another household opposite No. 14 Yongda Cotton Shop in the lane. As for the Yongda Cotton Shop, there were no traces of the robbers inside. Many detectives were stationed inside. The robbers were hiding in a house opposite. No. 14 is a two-story building, with the Qin Ya Silk Shop upstairs. After the robbers fled to another residence, detectives surrounded it tightly this morning, planning to search it again at dawn. It was also learned that the captured robbers had claimed that the remaining robbers had more than a dozen hand grenades in addition to Mauser pistols. Therefore, the detectives were very cautious when searching, fearing they would harm the residents.</p>
<p>Circumstances of the Robbery and Gunshot Wound at the Shop</p>
<p>According to the reporter's clear inquiry this morning, the Yongda Cotton Shop lost over one thousand yuan in cash stored in the shop, as well as several gold rings, pocket watches, and other ornaments. The Qin Ya Silk Shop upstairs was also looted, with considerable losses. There were more than ten staff members of Yongda Shop in the shop during the robbery. Because they let the robbers search, no one was injured. Only an old clerk named Zhang from Qin Ya Silk Shop was shot in the buttocks by a robber in the chaos. A mountain ambulance took him to the hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Pedestrian Kidnapped on Zhongshan Road Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Around 9:00 AM yesterday morning, near Zhongshan Road on the Great Western Road in western Shanghai, a man in his forties, wearing a light yellow raincoat, was walking along the road when four or five thugs suddenly appeared beside him, drew Mauser pistols, pointed them at the man, and forced him to go towards the Sanjing Temple.</p>
<h3>Central Police Station Detains a Large Number of Robbers</h3>
<p>Based on reports, the Central Police Station detained twenty-nine male and female robbery suspects, including Wang Fuyin, Xia Yinbao, Wu Yuan Shi, and Zhong Shang Shi, at No. 144 Hubei Road the day before yesterday. One handgun and nine bullets were confiscated. Yesterday, they were handed over to the First Criminal Court of the Special Court, and a request for detention was approved in accordance with Articles 76 and 101 of the Criminal Procedure Law. Judge Feng reviewed the situation and approved the detention for one week for further trial.</p>
<h3>Embezzlement Case of Rubber Factory Workers, Sentenced to Imprisonment</h3>
<p>Workers Wang Zhongfan and Li Xiangyang of the Da Zhonghua Rubber Factory at No. 1102 Xujiahui Road, in collusion with Maiguangtao, Chen Zhengfan, Xu Xiquan, Yu Genfa, Gao Shisheng, and other cargo clerks of the factory's warehouse at No. 3 Yongan Street, repeatedly forged documents to steal 180 dozen rubber shoes and sell them privately. They obtained 2,205 national currency, and each person received 315 yuan. The factory manager, Hong Zu, discovered the matter and reported it to the French Concession police, who arrested Wang and others. Only Gao Shisheng escaped upon hearing the news. They were handed over to the First Criminal Court of the Special Second Court for trial. Yesterday morning, Judge Sun Pengxian completed the trial and sentenced Wang Zhongfan, Li Xiangyang, and Baoguangtao to six months of imprisonment each for embezzling items held in the course of their business. Chen Zhengfan, Xu Xiquan, and Yu Genfa were each sentenced to four months of imprisonment as a warning.</p>
<h3>Two Gambling Raids Cracked</h3>
<p>French Police Department's Gambling Squad, Chinese and Western Detectives,</p>
<p>Acting on a confidential report the day before yesterday, cracked down on a gambling den at No. 13 Ganshi East Road, arresting six flower gambling offenders from Beiping: Wang Baoshan, Zhang Fenglin, Liu Zhi, Li Qingming, Lu Wenqing, and Wang Zhiheng. A large number of flower gambling slips and gambling silver were confiscated. The main offender, Ping Zhenbang, is at large. Yesterday afternoon, the police, along with the confiscated evidence, handed over all the arrested offenders to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Special Second Court for prosecution according to law.

<h3>Social Miscellany</h3>

Yesterday evening at 7:30, he committed suicide by swallowing a heavy dose of poison. He was discovered by someone, and a car was quickly hired to rush him to Renji Hospital, but resuscitation was ineffective, and he died an hour later.</p>
<p>A vacant workshop at a certain number of Lane 967, Avenue Albert, Avenue Joffre, in the French Concession, caught fire at 10:15 yesterday morning.

<h3>Girl Shot Dead at the Intersection of Route Papon and Rue Bayle; Four Shots to the Body, Death on the Spot; Discovered After the Fact on a Cold and Desolate Night</h3>
<p>At 8:50 last night, a fashionable woman, about 20 years old, wearing a snuff-colored velvet cheongsam, was walking along No. 369 Route Papon in the French Concession (the area is surrounded by a fence and is an open space used by a coal company to store coal) at the corner of Rue Bayle, when she was suddenly</p>
<p>Ambushed and Shot</p>
<p>by thugs on the way. She was shot four times in total: twice in the chest, once in the abdomen, and once in the left thigh. She fell to the ground and died on the spot. At this time, light snow was falling frequently, and the north wind was blowing hard. The area was also relatively deserted, so there were even fewer pedestrians. It was only about five minutes after the girl was shot that she was discovered. By the time the police arrived after being reported, the girl had already</p>
<p>Died on the Spot</p>
<p>Her body was taken to the morgue for examination. The police are investigating the girl's identity. When this reporter went to investigate, I asked the tea servers at the nearby Lao Hu Zao, who said that they did not hear any gunshots at the time, indicating that no one at the scene knew when the thugs opened fire.</p>
<h3>Living Conditions of Shanghai Workers in 1939</h3>
<p>The statistical data on the living conditions of Shanghai workers used in this article include living expenses, retail prices, wages, and working hours. Due to the circumstances of the current situation this year, economic and industrial activities have been affected, and the lives of laborers are also very different from the past.</p>
<p>Change of Base Period: The cost of living index published in the Bureau's 1938 annual report took 1936 as the base period, while the wage index took 1930 as the base period. Beginning this year, for the convenience of referencing and the clarity of the comparison, 1936 was changed to the base period. That year was the year before the Sino-Japanese War. At that time, the political, economic, and social situations were all stable, and it is most appropriate to use it as the base period to represent the trend of evolution after the outbreak of the war, which is more appropriate than tracing back to 1926. Therefore, the cost of living and wage indices for this year have been recalculated based on the new base period, and this example will be followed in the future to ensure uniformity.</p>
<p>Measurement of Worker Welfare</p>
<p>The actual income and cost of living of workers this year: The welfare of the working class should be measured by the amount of their income and the level of their cost of living. If income is high and expenses are low, then life is superior; otherwise, it is inevitable to struggle. This year, prices have soared, and the cost of living is higher than before the war. Taking 1936 as the base period, the cost of living index for this year is 203.25. However, the index from January to May was still between 150 and 165, so the annual average is only this number. In fact, the cost of living rose sharply in the second half of the year, reaching 283.23 in September and 304.06 in December. When the cost of living is high, the value of currency is low. Therefore, the purchasing power of one legal tender yuan in 1939 (the purchasing power of currency is the reciprocal of the cost of living index) was exactly equal to 4 jiao 9 fen 2 li in 1936, while one yuan in December 1939 was only worth 3 jiao 2 fen 8 li 9 hao. However, wages were also higher this year. The wage rate index was 109.09, and the actual income index was 29.09. Actual income refers to income in addition to wages, as well as subsidies, while fines and holiday wages have all been deducted. The high wages this year were most pronounced at the end of the year, so the annual average is not enough to show the situation at the end of the year. Now, based on the annual average, the increase in income is less than 20%, while the increase in expenses is more than 100%. There is no doubt that the gains do not offset the losses. Therefore, both rise together, but at different speeds. If you want to understand the actual living conditions, you should convert the monetary wages into real wages. Real wages are the purchasing power of monetary wages. The real wage index measures the rise and fall of the purchasing power of monetary wages based on the level of the cost of living. The method of calculating real wages is to divide the actual income index of the same period by the cost of living index. The real wage indices from 1936 to 1939 are listed below:</p>
<p>From the numbers listed above, the actual income was very low between 1937 and 1938, and higher in 1939, while the cost of living index rose dramatically year by year. Therefore, the real wage index for this year fell to 58.59. In other words, although income has increased this year, real wages are only slightly less than 60% of what they were in 1936. From this, it can be seen that high monetary wages have not really improved the living conditions of workers, and are even more difficult than in previous years. (1)</p>
<h3>Thorough Search by the Japanese in the Caoxi Road Pawnshop Alley</h3>

<h3>He Xitang Escapes Danger, Rumored to Have Been Released by Kidnappers, Whether Ransom Was Paid is Unknown, Police Are Investigating and Arresting Kidnappers</h3>
<p>Shanghai Thames Newspaper reported that according to the Public Concession Police Department yesterday (31st), He Xitang, 38 years old, the owner of Yuanfeng Hardware Store, who was kidnapped on Sunday morning, had been released by the kidnappers on Tuesday night. Mr. He is now in the Public Concession. Before the police department's announcement, Japanese newspapers had already reported that the Japanese Shanghai Self-Defense Corps had rescued Mr. He in the Western District on Sunday night. However, according to what</p>
<p>can be confirmed</p>
<p>as of yesterday, Mr. He did not escape danger through the efforts of the Japanese authorities and the police department. It is said that the kidnappers released Mr. He on their own. As for whether Mr. He paid a huge ransom, it is unknown. This matter is still shrouded in mystery. Police detectives are waiting for an opportunity to question Mr. He in order to obtain</p>
<p>some clues</p>
<p>to capture the kidnappers. According to reports, Mr. He was kidnapped at 7:45 on Sunday morning at his residence at No. 5 North Shanxi Road. It was then reported that four or five armed men, including two who were believed to be Japanese, rented a car and drove Mr. He away. The car drove to the Tientong Road area via North Suzhou Road and North Sichuan Road in the Hongkou District. The kidnappers then took Mr. He out of the car, and the Japanese Marines deployed sentries in the Tientong Road area to</p>
<p>search house to house</p>
<p>A Yunwanese man was found in possession of weapons and arrested. However, the whereabouts of the kidnappers and Mr. He were not found. According to the Japanese "Continental News," the Taiwanese man confessed to participating in the kidnapping case, and the Japanese authorities rescued Mr. He and captured three kidnappers based on his information. As of last night, the police department was unaware of the Japanese authorities' capture of the kidnappers.</p>
<h3>Five-Year-Old Child Kidnapping Case: Suspects Shirk Responsibility, Victim Rescued in Changzhou</h3>
<p>Chen Dayu, a native of Zhenjiang and manager of the Tangshan Bathhouse in Xingye Lane, Tianzhutang Street, French Concession, reported that his five-year-old son, named Liu Baozi, disappeared from his home at No. 18, Lane 69, Rue Jules Plaisance, at 3:00 PM on November 24 of last year. He received a letter demanding 10,000 yuan for his release. After reporting to the French Police Station for investigation, two fellow townsmen, Chuan Xiangtang (manager of Tianfa Bathhouse) and Dai Shizhang, were arrested and sent to the Second Criminal Court of the Special Court for investigation and detention.</p>
<p>Details of the "hanging meat ticket" (extortion)</p>
<p>further trial have been reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that when Dai Shizhang was arrested in the Great Beijing Courtyard of the Wing On Company, the victim, led by a woman, was also watching a play in the theater, waiting for the ransom to be paid. Upon seeing Dai's arrest, the victim was taken out by the woman who had brought him, and the bandit Wang Amao led him to Changzhou, demanding a ransom of 1,000 yuan. Because the area was an occupied zone, the French Police Station was unable to go there to arrest the bandits and recover the victim. Later, Chen Dayu's wife, Chen Jiang Shi, the mother of the victim Liu Baozi, went to Changzhou on a special trip to</p>
<p>rescue her son</p>
<p>She entrusted a Captain Wang to find a way to detain the two bandits, Wang Amao and Bi Guifu, and recover the victim. Currently, Chen Linfu is escorting the victim, Qie Baozi, back to Shanghai to return him to his parents. Chen Dayu reported to the French Police Station that Liu Baozi was taken away by Zhang Gao Shi, the wife of Zhang Fuqing, who lived upstairs in the same building. However, after the incident, the police interrogated the Zhang Fuqing couple, but released them as they were found to be unrelated. Now the police are going to arrest them again, but the Zhang couple have both</p>
<p>moved and fled</p>
<p>The case was continued yesterday morning by Judge Miao Qingbang of the Second Special Court in the First Criminal Court. Attorney Fei Xizhen of the Police Station prosecuted them for the crime of kidnapping for ransom. After the detective reported the previous circumstances, he questioned the defendant Fu Xiangtang, who stated, "I did not participate in the kidnapping. The plaintiff came to me with a letter and asked me to find a way to redeem the victim." Dai Shizhang stated, "Tu Changming asked me to ask Chuan Xiangtang to find a way, because there were disciples of Chuan among the bandits. I did not participate in the kidnapping." Attorneys Ge Zhiqin and Xu Wufang defended them. After reviewing the confessions, the court ordered a continuation of the trial in five days, and the defendants were remanded in custody.</p>

<h3>Finance Tianjin Merchants Frantically Acquire Foreign Exchange, Speculators Take Advantage of the Situation, British and American Exchange Rates Consistently Tighten</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no changes at the HSBC listing at 9:30 AM. However, at 3:30 PM during the second listing, the British exchange rate sharply contracted by 25, to 4 shillings and 25 pence, and the US exchange rate plummeted by 3.125, to 7.0625 yuan. Other currencies followed suit in tightening. The unofficial market for British and American exchange rates was even more strained, allegedly due to rumors that the Japanese had seized silver within the Tianjin concessions, causing the Tianjin exchange market to repeatedly contract. As a result, speculators from that region frantically rushed to Shanghai, while local speculators seized the opportunity to become active. Other operators, such as the large firm Sassoon, also followed suit. Furthermore, importers with actual needs, such as those settling cotton and wheat payments, fearing further fluctuations in exchange rates, mostly settled their accounts as early as possible. The insufficient supply from Hong Kong Electric and HSBC led to the closing price being close to the tightest price of the day. The market opened flat in the morning, but due to the frantic buying by Lihua and Bilee, and shortly after, Sassoon and other major foreign firms also began frantically settling their accounts, the tightness intensified sharply. By 10:45 AM, the rates had contracted to 4 shillings, 53125 pence and 7.53125 yuan. Later, due to the supply from Hong Kong Electric and Sassoon's return to the market, the market stabilized at noon, closing at 4 shillings, 546875 pence and 7.5625 yuan. Unexpectedly, the market tightened sharply again in the afternoon, with Sassoon returning to search for currency, and Japanese banks also settling accounts. Furthermore, Japanese spinning mills and speculators became active, and by 3:00 PM, the rates had softened again to the day's tightest prices of 4 shillings, 4375 pence and 7.375 yuan. The market stabilized somewhat in the late afternoon, closing at 4 shillings, 453125 pence and 7.40625 yuan, which was 1.875 pence and 3.125 yuan tighter than the previous day. The futures market showed a similar underlying trend to the spot market.</p>
<p>Large Volume of Cotton and Wheat Settlements</p>
<p>The market opened in the morning with London large bars at 3.125 pence higher for the near term and 4.375 pence higher for the far term. New York silver prices remained flat, and London gold prices were stable. Exchange rates for British currency against US dollars, Shanghai currency, French francs, etc., were all flat. US and British rates remained unchanged, but the rate against Shanghai currency decreased by 5 points, and the rate against French francs decreased by a small 3.75 points. Central Bank listings for various currencies remained the same. Bank spot selling prices at the opening were 4 shillings, 640625 pence for British gold and 7.71875 yuan for US currency, with no changes from the previous close. After opening, Lihua and Bilee, two foreign banks, started buying, and the supply from other banks was sluggish, so the tightening occurred quickly. By 9:25 AM, British gold had contracted to 4 shillings, 59375 pence, and US currency had softened to 7.625 yuan. The HSBC listing remained unchanged, and the silver equalization tax increased by two points. Afterward, Sassoon and other foreign firms also frantically bought, causing the market to continue to soften. By 9:35 AM, the rates had contracted to 4 shillings, 5625 pence and 7.5625 yuan. Later, a certain American bank showed some willingness to supply, and exporters also released currency. By 9:45 AM, the rates had rebounded to 4 shillings, 59375 pence and 7.625 yuan. However, because the demand from Lihua remained strong, and foreign firms returned to aggressively buy, and Japanese banks also suddenly became active, the market tightened and softened again. By 10:45 AM, the rates had contracted to 4 shillings, 53125 pence and 7.53125 yuan. Fortunately, Hong Kong Electric supplied currency, and Sassoon also slightly cashed out its profits in the spot market, while most buyers stopped activity, so the market slightly loosened. At noon closing, British gold was at 4 shillings, 546875 pence and US currency at 7.5625 yuan, tighter than the morning opening by 0.09375 pence and 0.15625 yuan.</p>
<p>HSBC Listing Contracted Again in the Afternoon</p>
<p>The afternoon market was full of rumors, and buyers rushed in even more. Sassoon and Japanese spinning mills frantically bought British and American currencies for March and April, and foreign firms, speculators, and Japanese banks also competed to buy, so the tightening was quite severe. By 3:15 PM, British gold had tightened to 4 shillings, 4375 pence, and US currency had softened to 7.375 yuan, and it was difficult to settle at the high price. At this time, the HSBC listing also tightened, with British currency down by 25 pence and US currency down by 3.125 yuan, and other currencies also decreased across the board. Later, fortunately, a certain bank came to supply currency at a high price, so the market slightly stabilized. At closing, British gold was at 4 shillings, 453125 pence and US currency at 7.40625 yuan. The current month saw British gold at 4 shillings, 40625 pence and US currency at 7.28125 yuan. The result was that the spot British currency was 1.875 pence tighter and the US currency was 3.125 yuan softer than the previous day.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Shanghai Exchange Rate Rises by Twelve Yuan</p>

<h3>Before the Grand Closing, the Gold Market is Vibrant, Reaching a High of 4,310 Yuan, An Unprecedented Rise This Year</h3>
<p>Yesterday's unofficial spot gold market suddenly surged, especially in the afternoon, breaking through the 4,300 yuan mark, adding to the vibrant gold market that had been developing recently. The reason was the prevalence of bullish rumors in the market, coupled with the extraordinarily tight exchange market, which strengthened the bullish sentiment of operators. Although the Tianjin group released a significant amount of gold in the morning, it ultimately had no impact. As a result, the price surged by more than 112 yuan. The exchange market opened tight and soft in the morning, and a certain gold firm and retail investors raised their offers first, pushing the price to 4,160 yuan, an increase of 27 yuan. Unexpectedly, a certain securities group suddenly emerged to represent the Tianjin group, and the upward momentum was immediately suppressed, falling back by 20 yuan. However, due to the continued tightening of foreign exchange and the competitive buying by a certain gold firm, and the secret activities of the Hong Kong group, the price rose to 4,175 yuan. The noon closing price was 4,166 yuan. In the afternoon, foreign exchange tightened again, and confidence increased. Securities groups and gold firms rose to frantically buy, and the Hong Kong group also returned to purchase. Retail investors also became bullish and followed closely, and the market was firm. The price once soared to a high of 4,310 yuan. Later, a certain securities group took profits and sold, and retail investors also sold, pushing the price down by 75 yuan. However, at the closing price, the price was still 4,245 yuan. Trading was extremely active throughout the day, with over 2,000 taels traded. Gold jewelry once rose to 435 yuan, but then fell back by a small 5 yuan, resulting in an increase of 10 yuan. Customs gold remained flat.</p>
<p>Spot Gold Rises Sharply by 110 Yuan</p>
<p>From the beginning of the morning, each bar (ten taels), the exchange market stepped softly, and sentiment was nervous. Buyers were quite crowded, and the market immediately raised the price by 27 yuan. A certain gold firm bought ten taels from a securities group for 4,160 yuan. At this time, the sentiment was quite enthusiastic. Unexpectedly, a securities group, acting for the Tianjin group, began selling, and buyers hesitated to move forward, causing the price to fall back by 20 yuan. A silver shop group sold twenty taels to a gold firm for 4,140 yuan. Later, due to the continued tightening of foreign exchange, a certain gold firm and a certain money exchange firm seized the opportunity to buy low, and the Hong Kong group secretly intervened, causing the price to soar again by 35 yuan. A certain gold firm bought fifty taels from a money exchange firm for 4,175 yuan. Soon after, another money exchange firm suddenly came to supply currency, and a certain silver shop also followed suit and sold, causing the price to fall back by 19 yuan. A certain money exchange firm bought twenty taels from a certain silver shop for 4,156 yuan. Afterward, a certain securities group came to buy again, raising the price by 14 yuan. The securities group bought thirty taels from a money exchange firm for 4,170 yuan. Near the closing time, a spot gold firm came to sell, causing the price to fall by 4 yuan. The spot gold firm sold twenty taels to a money exchange firm for 4,166 yuan, the noon closing price. In the afternoon, the market trend was firm, and the market opened 14 yuan higher. A money exchange firm bought ten taels from a silver shop group for 4,180 yuan. Soon after, the price fell back by a small 10 yuan. The money exchange firm sold twenty taels to a securities group for 4,170 yuan. After this, rumors suddenly arose, and because of the sharp tightening of foreign exchange, buying surged from all directions. Securities groups, gold firms, and retail investors competed to wildly drag up prices, and the Hong Kong group also entrusted a gold firm to buy on their behalf. Furthermore, the supply was extremely scarce, causing the price to leap by 140 yuan, breaking through the 4,300 yuan mark. A certain silver shop bought twenty taels from a securities group for 4,310 yuan. Later, the tightening of foreign exchange eased slightly, and a certain securities group took profits and came out of the market. At the same time, many floating investors also closed out their positions, and the price soon fell back by 75 yuan. The securities group sold thirty taels to a money exchange firm for 4,235 yuan. Later, a certain gold firm came to search for currency again, raising the price by 10 yuan. The gold firm bought twenty taels from a certain silver shop for 4,245 yuan, the evening closing price. The result was that the price surged by 112 yuan compared to the previous day, and it had risen for two consecutive days, with a total increase of 144 yuan. After closing, the price rose again to 4,255 yuan. The entire day's range was first up and then down by 170 yuan. The selling price of the spot gold firm's own brand gold was a few yuan higher than the spot gold price, and the buying price was 20 yuan lower. The current bid gold was over 50 yuan lower than the listed gold.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Listed Up Ten Yuan</p>
<p>The selling price of silver jewelry per tael was initially listed at 420 yuan by the major firms. Then, at 2:15 PM, it was listed up by 5 yuan. At 3:05 PM, it was listed up again by 5 yuan. Over five minutes later, it was listed up again by 5 yuan. At 3:25 PM, it fell back by a small 5 yuan. The result was that it was listed up by 10 yuan. The major firms changed the listing to 430 yuan, and the new firms listed at the same price. The buying price was about 15 yuan lower.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currency Soars, US Dollar Notes Sell for Thirteen Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw strong buying momentum due to the spot exchange rate, and the supply of British and American gold pounds was scarce, causing the market price to rise sharply. Demand for British and American gold notes was very strong, and the market price was firm. US dollar notes rose firmly to 13.22 yuan in the morning, and the upward momentum was even stronger in the afternoon, rising further to 13.35 yuan in the evening market. The supply of Hong Kong notes and French franc notes was quite scarce. Singapore and Dutch notes were also being acquired. Canadian notes and Philippine notes followed suit and tightened, all rising across the board. Japanese gold notes, on the other hand, trended weaker, at 1.255 yuan in the evening market. Korean notes also decreased slightly, at 1.025 yuan in the evening market. Yesterday's market prices were: British gold pounds up 2.75 yuan, British gold notes up 1.70 yuan, US gold pounds up 1.70 yuan, US gold notes up 0.51 yuan, Hong Kong notes up 0.07 yuan, French franc notes up 0.005 yuan, Singapore and Dutch notes both up 0.20 yuan, Annam notes up 0.04 yuan, Robi notes up 0.10 yuan, Canadian notes up 0.50 yuan, Philippine notes up 0.15 yuan. Only Italian notes, Australian gold notes, and Siamese notes remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Discount Rate Rises Sharply, Reaching 36 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday's discount rate for exchange drafts suddenly rose sharply, mainly due to the wildly tight foreign exchange market, the sharp rise in spot gold, and the approaching end of the lunar year, which led to a sudden increase in the need for cash. The rate rose to 27 yuan per thousand in the morning, then to 28.5 yuan at noon. The increase was even sharper in the afternoon, finally reaching 36 yuan, an increase of 10.25 yuan compared to the previous day. The money industry association's overnight interest rate remained at 0.1 yuan in both the morning and afternoon markets, it was said.</p>
<h3>Securities Domestic Debt Plummets, Market Price Falls by One or Two Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday's unofficial securities market suddenly saw an unexpected disturbance. Coinciding with the period after dividend payments, sellers dumped aggressively. The news was complex and difficult to verify, with some saying it was about Tianjin silver and others about military affairs in eastern Zhejiang. In reality, it was all just unsubstantiated rumors. However, sentiment was inevitably volatile, and various bonds plummeted by around one or two yuan. Category D shares opened after dividend payments, down another yuan in both the morning and afternoon, and the situation was extremely weak. At the same time, spot gold surged wildly again, making buyers feel even more confused, and confidence weakened further. After closing, there were also rumors of the issuance of treasury bills, which had no relation to government bonds themselves. Based on people's observations, there may still be a small market. Considering the environment, the market price has already fallen sharply, and there may be a rebound. Today's market will inevitably be chaotic. In the morning, the market price was slightly weaker due to the dumping of Deutsch-Asiatische Bank and Lienho, and there were fewer buyers. In the afternoon, rumors suddenly arose, and sentiment suddenly weakened. The market price plummeted due to the aggressive selling of Fifth Issue and Deutsch-Asiatische Bank. Various bonds sharply broke through two levels, and trading surged. The results were that all bonds, except for the newly opened Category D shares, fell sharply by 1.05 to 2.10 yuan. The total transaction volume was approximately 1.5 million yuan. A brief table is listed below.</p>
<p>London, 31st (Electric Dispatch). The listed prices of British companies' Far East stocks rose again today. Jardine Insurance Corporation shares rose 5 shillings, to 26 pounds and 15 shillings. HSBC Bank's London-registered shares rose 0.5 pounds, to 87.5 pounds. Hong Kong-registered shares remained unchanged. Butterfield &amp; Swire shares rose 3 pence, to 1 shilling and 6 pence. The rest remained flat.</p>
<p>London, 31st (Electric Dispatch). The listed prices of Chinese foreign debt remained stable today. There were no changes in any of the upper and lower range bonds.</p>
<h3>Rubber Stocks See the Most Trading</h3>
<p>The stock market of the Public Association saw the entire market's focus concentrated on rubber stocks due to the extraordinarily tight foreign exchange market and the high price of raw rubber from overseas. In the short one-hour period in the afternoon, the trend was extremely strong and the transaction volume was astonishing. Almost all stocks rose during the rally, with many prices reaching about one-tenth higher. Trading in industrial stocks was relatively scarce, but the underlying trend was also extraordinarily firm. Jardine Matheson spinning mill shares rose to 36 yuan, which was particularly noteworthy.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton, Foreign Exchange Tightens, Cotton Yarn Prices Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>The yarn market continued to rise, and the upward trend remained strong. This was due to the contraction of foreign exchange, which boosted sentiment and triggered speculative buying. Although actual demand was sluggish, buyers continued to flock in, and the market gradually increased. Trading in February futures yarn became increasingly hectic.</p>
<p>Spot yarn opened with buoyant sentiment in the morning. Upon hearing of the continued tightening of foreign exchange, there were even more scalpers buying. 20-count Double Horse yarn opened at 753 yuan and rose directly to 756.5 yuan. However, the price fluctuated at this level for a long time, and the closing price remained firm. It was found that 1,275 bales were traded in the half-day period. The market price for 20-count Double Horse yarn rose 6 yuan, Flying Lady yarn rose 6 yuan, and Double Globe yarn rose 5 yuan. Today, 120 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong. The amount bought by each business group is listed below:</p>
<p>Hong Kong 260 Peers 985</p>
<p>Mainland 20 Statistics 1,25</p>
<h3>First Batch of Ningbo Cotton Arrives, Over 9,600 Bales</h3>
<p>Cotton trading was completely halted because the end of the lunar year was approaching, and various firms had already closed, waiting to take action next year, so transactions were quiet. However, in the afternoon, upon hearing that the exchange market continued to contract, sentiment was further boosted. However, the market price had not been opened. The source of cotton from northern Jiangsu, including 327 bales of Tonghua cotton, it was said.</p>
<p>The amount of Ningbo cotton shipped to Shanghai each year is very large. After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, shipments to Shanghai greatly decreased. The new cotton harvest in the autumn of last year was very good, but because the government implemented controls, Ningbo cotton had disappeared from Shanghai. It has been learned that the Taikoo Company's Huangpu wheel returned to Shanghai from , loaded with a full ship of 9,654 bales of cotton to Shanghai on the 31st of the previous day. The cotton is the first batch from the new cotton of the 28th year to date and was purchased by the American firm, Hengda.</p>
<p>In other news, foreign cotton market prices: The New York cotton market first rose this morning due to speculative buying, but then turned weak due to spot traders and Liverpool firms selling in the market. As a result, the closing price was slightly less than 35 pounds per quintal higher than the previous day. The Indian market was particularly firm, rising by more than 10 rupees. However, it is predicted that the price will fall back, and the result will not be much different from the previous day. Egyptian cotton rose more than 40 pounds per quintal, Liverpool spot prices rose more than 20 pence, and forward prices fell more than 10 pence.</p>
<p>Shanghai foreign cotton trading: Yesterday, the foreign exchange rate suddenly tightened, and because the end of the year was approaching, traders were very relaxed about purchasing foreign cotton. Although cotton yarn prices were high, the mills temporarily did not intend to buy raw cotton. Japanese mills were the same. The factory prices calculated at the US exchange rate of 7.5 yuan yesterday are as follows:</p>
<p>20-count American Middling 134.90</p>
<p>20-count Same Inferior 231.40</p>
<p>32-count Same 243.60</p>
<p>32-count Same Inferior 241.10</p>
<p>42-count Same 246.40</p>
<p>42-count Same Inferior 243.00</p>
<h3>Food Grains Recycled Flour Commands High Prices, Green Cannon Cart Sells for 12.20 Yuan</h3>
<p>Flour: Yesterday's flour market reached a new high. Since various factories restricted supply, although factory prices were said to be unchanged, in reality there was no product to buy. In general, buyers urgently demanded before the factory prices were increased. Under the environment of low supply and high demand, the market became increasingly rampant, and recycled flour prices climbed higher and higher, with new peaks being seen. It was heard that the price of Green Cannon Cart warehouse receipts rose to 12.20 yuan yesterday, another 0.5 yuan higher than the previous day. Old Cannon Cart warehouse receipts also reached 11.60 yuan. However, the sellers all planned to wait for the New Year's opening, and then sell at a good price, so transactions were only 1,000 to 2,000 bags. Retail transactions on this street were also less than 5,000 bags. Given this situation, the upward trend in the flour market may be difficult to curb for a while. The market yesterday was filled with rumors, and the wild rise in the gold market and the tightening of foreign exchange were all driving up prices, making the livelihood of ordinary people extremely worrying.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday's wheat market situation did not have any special changes. The highest price still stood at the original 20 yuan. Since flour prices gradually increased, the amount of domestic wheat stored and delivered was small, and the owners repeatedly hoarded, and because the end of the year was approaching, various parties were preparing to close, and the market was even less willing to sell. Apart from some direct allocations to factories, only a few hundred bags were traded. It is estimated that Suzhou wheat was 20 yuan, Wuyi wheat was 19.95 yuan, and Zhenjiang wheat was slightly less than 19.30 yuan. Formal transactions will probably wait for the New Year's opening.</p>
<h3>Limited Trading in Duroc Rice, Foreign Rice is Uniquely Popular</h3>
<p>Yesterday's rice market had already announced a yellow market, which would close in four days, so trading on the market was limited. Most of the transactions were limited to store additions. Yesterday, 200 to 300 bags of early and late rice were exported from the Hongkou district, but general traders were mostly engaged in closing and were reluctant to sell again. In the event of an inquiry, the price was unusually high, thus breaking the previous market stalemate and instead presenting a tight color. As a result, apart from the fact that domestic rice such as thin rice could no longer change in any way, outside the price limit, the white Yuanshi order supplies sold well under the hot demand of cake shops and rice stalls, with a rise of about 0.5 yuan. Foreign rice has become the only bulk outlet in the market, with a solid foot and a welcome from the people, so in this hot stage, the market has seen an increase of 4 or 5 yuan. It is estimated that the closing price of No. 1 Saigon was especially 42 yuan, the market was 41.7 yuan, No. 2 Saigon was 40.04 yuan, Huojiao was 40.05 yuan to 40.03 yuan, Daxiao was 37.5 yuan, rice bran was 32.5 yuan to 32.2 yuan, and Tokyo Jianjian was especially from 38.5 yuan, the next was 37.8 yuan. It is estimated that only more than 5,000 bags were traded in the whole city.</p>

<h3>Sugar Market Sugar Prices Increase</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market saw prices increase due to the tightening of foreign exchange and undiminished confidence. Coarse sand and white sugar from the 24th original warehouse increased by 1 yuan to 59 yuan. Sugar from other warehouses increased by 0.20 to 0.30 yuan: Xinhua was 59 yuan, old goods were 58.60 to 58.50 yuan, and transshipped goods increased by 0.50 yuan to 49 yuan. Taikoo sugar of various grades increased by 0.50 yuan: B grade was 59 yuan from the western warehouse and 58.50 yuan from the eastern warehouse, CW grade was 58 yuan from the western warehouse and 57.50 yuan from the eastern warehouse, CX and other grades were all 57.50 yuan from the western warehouse and 57 yuan from the eastern warehouse. The H grade cart also did not change, remaining at 42 yuan. Dutch red sugar also did not change, remaining at 44.50 yuan. Domestic cotton white sugar also rose at the same rate, and coarse sand of the same grade also increased by 1 yuan. Zhenji No. 1 white sugar was 59 yuan and No. 2 was 58.50 yuan. This factory's Yong 70 was 70.05 yuan and Jingming Yong 71 was 71 yuan. The CIF price for Dutch electricity coarse sand K.G. was 11 Dutch guilders 1.5 cents, it was said.</p>
<h3>Metals Actual Sales Suffer</h3>
<p>Metal trading has been unremarkable for one or two days. Because firms from other ports have closed and returned home, few people inquire about the goods. In this street, factory merchants and those who store goods, as well as small buyers, all plan a grand closing for the end of the lunar year, and current cash is particularly tight. Therefore, the purchasing power for various metal products is also weak. Therefore, transactions were extremely small yesterday, and because the wind and rain have not stopped for days, the metal products that are prone to rust (such as tinplate, sheet iron, plain white iron, and white lead skin) could not be taken out, so business was slow and the opening price did not change much.</p>

<h3>American Refugee Hospital</h3>
<p>— Ruo Meng</p>
<p>Registration Fee Only One Cent, Treatment Entirely Free</p>
<p>Shanghai, built upon gleaming gold, demands money for everything. "To stand requires money, to sit requires money," is a truly insightful saying.</p>
<p>Let's not discuss other matters; simply falling ill is already troublesome enough. The wealthy, after all, are wealthy; they spend large sums, enter large hospitals, and medical and treatment expenses, running into hundreds or thousands, are of no concern to them. But we poor folks worry day and night even about food; once we fall ill, we're truly helpless, left to fate and battling the disease. If we win, good for us; if we lose, we simply breathe our last, and no one pities us.</p>
<p>Although Shanghai is not without charitable organizations offering free treatment, they never seem to be extensive enough, not reaching all levels of society. Moreover, due to financial constraints, many beneficial public programs are hindered to varying degrees.</p>
<p>Here, the writer sincerely introduces a free hospital to the impoverished masses of the city: the "American Hospital For Refugees."</p>
<p>The "American Refugee Hospital" is affiliated with the American Tongren Hospital, boasting not only excellent facilities but also a staff of highly skilled doctors. Their establishment aims to genuinely take on the responsibility of saving the impoverished masses. Therefore, treatment, hospitalization, and medicine are completely free. Only a one-cent registration fee is required. Even if you cannot afford that one cent, it does not matter, as the cent is merely a formality.</p>
<p>Currently, they not only have a large number of outpatients every day but also accommodate many seriously ill patients, covering various internal and external medicine departments. And, although it is free, the patients' food and medical care are, frankly, more refined than those of ordinary fee-paying hospitals.</p>
<p>Finally, the address of the "American Refugee Hospital" is 37 Bailinan Road, opposite Zhaofeng Garden.</p>

<h3>Leaving Money to Buy the Road</h3>
<p>— Zhu Lü</p>
<p>The steamer approached the Bund Garden. The majestic buildings and brilliant lights of the metropolis instantly flashed into my eyes.</p>
<p>As soon as we carried our four or five pieces of luggage ashore, a crowd of rickshaw pullers, taxi drivers, and carriage drivers immediately surrounded us. We managed to hire two rickshaws, loading the four or five pieces of luggage onto them. My rickshaw had barely moved a few dozen steps when the group of touts from earlier surrounded us again:</p>
<p>"Little brother, I haven't eaten! Help me out!" Four or five rough, dark fists pounded my arms and waved in my face. One or two fellows even hid their index and middle fingers in their coats, pretending to hold guns to threaten me:</p>
<p>"Hurry, hurry! Pig, hit!"</p>
<p>I had three pieces of luggage, big and small, loaded onto the rickshaw, unable to move. My hands were occupied protecting the luggage, unable to move freely. Furthermore, the police officer was four or five streets away.</p>
<p>"Okay, okay, I'll give you some." I reached into my pocket with one hand while using my foot to signal the rickshaw puller to start moving. However, the rickshaw puller remained motionless. This forced me to actually take out money. At first, I wanted to grab some ten-cent bills for them, but the pocket where I kept them was empty. In a panic, I had to pull out a paper packet from another pocket, containing three or four dollars. I unfolded it, holding out a one-dollar bill to the one on the right. But the remaining few dollars in my left hand were immediately snatched away by a few fellows on the left.</p>
<p>I exhaled, and then kicked the rickshaw again, signaling the puller to move. Our small wave of people and rickshaws began to merge into the sea of people and vehicles.</p>
<h3>Regarding Ticket Vendors Skimming Profits</h3>
<p>— Ruo Wu</p>
<p>Regarding the skimming of profits by public bus and tram ticket vendors, various newspapers have recently engaged in heated discussions. Some talked about moral issues, while others proposed ways to stop it, but none delved deeply into the living conditions of the ticket vendors. They were merely "treating the symptoms." Last month, this publication published an article titled "My Views on Improving Ticket Vendor Skimming," in which the author cited three reasons why ticket vendors of the Nanshi China Merchants Tram Company did not skim profits, which we can use as a reference. This is worth noting.</p>
<p>With the cost of living several times higher than before the war, all levels of society living by their labor are living very painful lives. Ticket vendors are no exception, so talking about moral issues is really off-topic. And preventive measures? Before they took effect, we discovered the news of escalating skimming, employing lookouts, and large-scale skimming.</p>
<p>Fortunately, this skimming secret was discovered by the company's plainclothes Western ticket inspectors. The news did not mention how the ticket vendor was punished, and we do not know. We also do not need to know. However, since this secret (I suspect there is more than just "lookouts" involved in the skimming secret) was discovered by the company itself, they would not just punish that ticket vendor and be done with it. They would certainly trace the root cause, investigate whether other ticket vendors other than the discovered ticket vendor also had the same problems, and the reasons why ticket vendors were skimming profits. Then, the company authorities would discuss appropriate measures to eliminate this "secret," which would be much more effective than merely scratching an itch from afar.</p>
<h3>After the Rain, a Clear Sky</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter Twenty: Global Transportation, Shared Language, Rewarding Education, Cherishing Talent</p>
<p>Regarding this color issue, some say: There is a distinction between civilization and barbarism. Roughly speaking, semi-civilized nations tend to prefer bright reds and greens because such colors are stimulating. Children also like the color red. If you put a red toy and a red fruit next to other colors, they will grab the red one first. Also, in the inland villages of China, young women aged seventeen or eighteen used to wear bright red cotton-padded jackets or bright red cotton pants, or at least tie two red belts. If a young woman in the metropolis still dressed like this, people would say she was countrified. Furthermore, the uniforms of soldiers and the clothes of prisoners used to be red, but now they have changed. War and criminals both belong to uncivilized things. So, does the color issue really have a distinction between civilization and barbarism? In fact, things like the color red, and stimulating people, are true. You cannot simply distinguish civilization and barbarism based on that. Moreover, color is the natural civilization, the colors of the world. Flowers are red; you cannot force them to all become white. Leaves are green; you cannot force them to all become purple. In the past, each generation had its preferred colors, and today each country still has its preferred colors. In China, auspicious ceremonies favor red because auspicious ceremonies are always happy events, and red is stimulating enough to make people happy. Today, many female Western teachers have come to visit, and they don't dislike this red color at all. Some of them are even wearing red clothes, which gives them a magnificent air. At this time, this new room is filled with many Chinese and Western female guests, personally hosted by Jin Danyun. After a short while, Wu Junke went to the West Station to return to Suzhou. Jin Danyun sent her off with many wedding sweets. Originally, Junsu wanted to see her off to the station, but she said: No, there's no need. Junsu also instructed her: Ask for a day off next Monday, and be sure to come back on Tuesday. They played at Jin Danyun's house until twelve o'clock, and then everyone dispersed. The next morning, at nine o'clock, the two Misses He went to the International Hotel to visit Mr. Jiang Jingrong, the senior family friend from Beijing, who had indeed arrived. Mr. Jiang was also an old friend of Mr. He, but the two Misses were meeting him for the first time today. This was because the two Misses had studied abroad for many years, so they had gradually become unfamiliar with many relatives and friends. It turned out that Mr. Jiang Jingrong was over fifty years old, with a dark face and gradually graying hair. Speaking of his background, it was also very difficult; he was an orphan from a young age. His father passed away when he was eight years old, and he only had a mother, but he did have two younger sisters. (235)</p>
<h3>Coal Shortage!</h3>
<p>— Xin Meng</p>
<p>Rice is being manipulated, flour is being hoarded, and coal is also being monopolized in the market, causing a coal shortage. In reality, is there really a coal shortage? Just like the past rice and flour shortages, it is due to private monopoly and manipulation. The Coal Industry Association is saying that there is a coal shortage and that there will be a shortage of goods, but isn't there a large amount of coal stockpiled in Pudong, waiting for a good price to sell?</p>
<p>The rapid rise in coal prices is also an extremely serious problem. Especially in the last few days, we can see the panic of the boiled water industry in the newspapers. Ordinary families need to go to tiger stoves to get boiled water every day. Boiled water prices have risen several times in the past because of coal prices. If coal continues to rise without limits, tiger stoves will be forced to raise prices again. Moreover, from factories to stalls selling pancakes, steamed buns, and glutinous rice rolls, which one does not need coal as fuel? Therefore, the rise in coal prices will also cause the prices of many goods to rise.</p>
<p>However, the most serious problem is coal balls. In half a month, the price of coal balls quickly rose from four yuan per dan (a unit of weight) to four yuan and six jiao (ten cents). According to coal store owners, it looks like it will rise further, reaching five yuan. Everyone knows that coal balls are the main fuel for Shanghai residents. If someone were to make a statistic, the daily consumption of coal balls would certainly be a large number, which shows the great impact it has on the lives of citizens.</p>
<p>The extremely high price of coal has had the effects as described above, and this coal shortage is not a true coal shortage, but due to some people hoarding and speculating, manipulating the market. We deeply hope that social figures who care about the lives of citizens should quickly pay attention to this issue. In particular, we hope that the authorities of the "isolated island" will immediately take effective measures to crack down on hoarders and lower prices so that ordinary citizens can alleviate some of the unbearable suffering.</p>

<p>Entertainment World</p>
<h3>Talking About the Kuide Troupe Coming to Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Tianma</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>The Kuide Troupe's engagement to come to Shanghai can be considered a recent development in the Shanghai theater scene. However, the name Kuide Troupe seems somewhat unfamiliar to those in Shanghai's opera circles. Here, let me introduce some information about them, which can also serve as a timely piece of entertainment writing. The Kuide Troupe is not, as some say, a female training class. It is simply a theatrical troupe organized by female performers. It has nearly thirty years of history in North China. Initially, it was led by Xian Lingzhi and Zhang Xiaoxian, and it was a troupe that mixed Hebei Bangzi opera and Peking opera. At that time, it was very popular among the wives and young ladies of royal and aristocratic families in the old capital. The plays performed focused on family ethics to cater to the general audience's psychology. Using scenery, wearing fashionable clothes, speaking Mandarin, and singing Peking opera melodies was truly a popular trend at that time, and it occupied a significant position in the Peking opera scene in the old capital.</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>The changes of the times have not exempted the Kuide Troupe. After 1921, almost all the old performers either got married or left. Thus, new performers appeared in a process of metabolism. Actresses like Zhang Yanfen, Qin Fengyun, and Xue Yanqin, who were very popular at the time, all served as leading female roles in the troupe. At the same time, the plays also followed the trend, focusing on the creation of love and sorrowful plots. However, due to the political situation in the capital at that time, the Peking opera scene was directly or indirectly affected to a considerable extent, and the Kuide Troupe barely managed to maintain the situation. "A Comedy of Marriage" can be considered a play that revived the Kuide Troupe. At that time, the leading female role was Li Guiyun, who had come to Shanghai before, the male role was Xiao Lanfen, and the painted-face role was Wang Qingkui. The business was so prosperous that it was invited to Tianjin four or five times, and each time it returned with honor. Unfortunately, good times did not last long. Internal disagreements arose, so Li Guiyun withdrew and formed the Xinde Troupe in Tianjin. Then, there was the Tongde Troupe confronting them in Beijing. The talents of the Kuide Troupe were also divided into three parts, almost causing it to collapse. Fortunately, the boss, Yang Yunpu, managed it well, and with the female role Xian Ruifang as the mainstay, it was still able to maintain the situation. Later, Li Guiyun who came to Shanghai was from her Xinde Troupe, and was not actually from the Kuide Troupe.</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>Although the Kuide Troupe is famous for its new costume dramas, it actually still focuses on traditional plays. All the organization follows the rules of the opera troupe, with civil and military managers, assistants, and martial arts performers. In addition to the main play, the rest are traditional plays, which are shared by various roles. Sometimes, continuous plays are also arranged, such as "Jigong the Living Buddha," "Journey to the West," "The Weaver Girl and the Cowherd"... etc. In addition, plays are also adapted from movies, such as "Sister Flowers," "Rebirth Flower," "Peach Blossom Sheds Blood," "A Comedy of Marriage," "Plum Blossom Falls," "A College Student"... etc. Other famous works such as "La Dame aux Camélias," "The Two Orphans," "Breaking the Engagement," "One Yuan," "Tears in the Green Window," "Jade Pear Soul," "Sunrise," "Thunderstorm"... etc. are also used as scripts and adapted, inserting various singing skills according to the importance of the roles, which is more than enough compared to the so-called improved Peking opera of today.</p>
<h3>"China Travel" to Perform "Ge Nenniang"</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>Wang Xianzai and Wife Guest Star as Zheng Zhilong and Wife</p>
<p>"Empress Dowager Cixi" Already Rushing to Produce Scenery and Props</p>
<p>After the reorganization of "China Travel," while sending a telegram to Hong Kong to bring Ruoqing back, Tang Huaiqiu took this opportunity to supplement "Confucius" at Minghua. Now Ruoqing has returned from Hong Kong, and they have decided to continue performing on New Year's Eve, according to the old lunar calendar. The play to be performed is also beyond our expectations, not "Empress Dowager Cixi" but "Ge Nenniang." It is said that the audience requested this play.</p>
<p>According to what this writer has learned, in addition to Tang Ruoqing's Ge Nenniang, Chen Qi's Meiniang, Shi Wen's Sun Kexian, Tu Guangqi's Cai Ruheng, Liu Qiong's Zheng Chenggong, Yan Fei's Majinzi, and Zhang Zhizhi's Bolo, which are familiar to the audience, Wang Xianzai and Yuan Zhuru, husband and wife, are invited to guest star as Zheng Zhilong and Madam Tian.</p>
<p>As for "Empress Dowager Cixi," which has been announced for a long time, the scenery and props are already being rushed to produce. After "Ge Nenniang" is performed, "Empress Dowager Cixi" will be rehearsed at the same time. The director will probably still be Wu Yonggang.</p>
<h3>Outside the Peking Opera Scene</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>The Golden Voice is Broken</p>
<p>Golden voice, iron voice, originally referred to the actor's voice being strong, brighter the more they sang, and never breaking. If an actor approaches women in middle age, even if they have a natural talent, their voice will immediately be ruined, and there will be a danger of collapse. Shao Shan and Duo Kui are indeed the rarest of talents in the painted-face and old female roles. Although the charm of the two men's singing is not very rich, their natural good voices can always make the listeners' spirits excited. Unfortunately, according to people from Beijing recently, both of their voices have problems. Duo Kui originally had a passion for Lian, and when he went to Taiyuan to perform many times, his father was next to him to monitor him, so he could do whatever he wanted. When he returned to Beijing, his voice was once lost. Later, his brother secretly reported to his father, who strictly restricted him, and encouraged by his close friends, he resolutely corrected his mistakes and worked hard. In recent years, he has even earned the leading position in the old female roles, which is a benefit to the Peking opera scene and his personal fortune. But his old father passed away last year, and he lost his fear. This time, he went south to perform again and was greatly welcomed by the audience, which increased his pride. After returning to the old capital, there were no more good friends to encourage him. So, he became lazy, indulging in pleasure, drinking and engaging in sexual activities (Li is very fond of drinking), which ruined his voice. At a time when the old female roles are extremely lacking in talent, it would be a pity if Duo Kui continues to decline and follows in the footsteps of Wo Yun. I really hope that this is a false rumor, so that I will not be disappointed in my expectations of him. (180)</p>
<h3>Theater Workers Kong Lin and Others Leave Shanghai Together</h3>
<p>— Piaoxu</p>
<p>Wishing you all the best in your efforts</p>
<p>Not long ago, the Xindu Theater once opened a children's Sunday theater. At that time, those who cooperated with it and aimed to promote theater movement were the theater work practitioners who are about to leave Shanghai for the mainland: the "China Drama Research Association."</p>
<p>This group of members is a large group of young people who live in a turbulent environment and want to fight to break through the environment with their own strength. For the sake of the country and for the sake of art, they have not diminished their innocence, enthusiasm, and heroic struggle in the "isolated island." During the two long but short years, they unfolded the most valuable aspect of their work.</p>
<p>In the "Lone Army Camp," performing for the comfort of the nation's heroes who fought bloodily against the war was almost a regular task. In the refugee camps, they were like a flame. In the vivid and realistic scenes, many tears welled up in the eyes of the refugees. They not only grasped the kind and painful scars of the displaced, but they also did their best to provide active educational performances.</p>
<p>A month ago, the one-act play "Wen Daxing," a brilliant depiction of a national hero, was published. Kong Lin was universally loved by the entire theater movement. However, precisely because of this, he had to leave. In winter, there was bound to be a gust of wind trying to destroy such a weak life! Finally, he had to lead the young and hardworking workers to be forced to leave the "isolated island" and head to the rear to work.</p>
<p>In the great era of turmoil, the "China Drama Research Association" established its own position in the cultural field.</p>
<h3>Jade Toes Spreading Fragrance</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>Zuo Lingna is known for dancing on her toes, so this sensational Broadway play was brought to the screen by Warner Bros.</p>
<p>The story of "Jade Toes Spreading Fragrance" is like other musical films. In addition to introducing two performances, it inserts a romance between a male and female protagonist. But just as the story of "The Broadway Melody" pointed out the inevitable elimination of silent films, it also points out that the life of a performing troupe will inevitably decline after the rise of the film industry. In our China, there are some conservatives who stubbornly hold onto "antiques" and do not know how to improve. This is truly a dangerous "argument"!</p>
<p>The director of "Jade Toes Spreading Fragrance" tries his best to introduce two performances, using lively shots to give Zuo Lingna's toe dance ample opportunity to develop. The rendering of the romance, on the other hand, strengthens various jokes. Therefore, for the sake of entertainment, "Jade Toes Spreading Fragrance" is worth watching.</p>
<p>Edia Albert, who plays Philip, is not a young man. His flat face is his biggest flaw. Alan Hale has quite the style of Blackmer Morgan. He added a lot of jokes to "Jade Toes Spreading Fragrance."</p>
<p>Cantonese Opera News: The famous Hong Kong and Guangdong opera troupe Da Luotian will come to Shanghai soon. They are scheduled to perform Cantonese opera at the Da Zhonghua Theater at the intersection of Yu Qiaqing Road and Fuzhou Road during the Lunar New Year holiday. The performers include Wu Sheng (martial male role) Xin Zhu, who is good at performing the Three Kingdoms Guan Gong plays, and is known as the living Guan Gong in the South. Wenwu Sheng (civil-martial male role) Wu Yuanxi is elegant. Xiao Wu (young martial male role) Gu Tianwu can be said to be unique in martial arts plays. These two famous actors have previously come to Shanghai to perform and were praised by the general public. Hua Dan (female role) Gan Yiyun is excellent in both appearance and acting skills, and her singing and acting are excellent. The witty Sheng (male role) Liu Shaowen makes the audience roar with laughter every time he performs a play. His wit is truly hilarious. These famous actors have long been famous in Hong Kong, Guangdong, and Southeast Asia. Now, with the help of many excellent actors, there will be a lively event.</p>
