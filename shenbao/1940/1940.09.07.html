<p>馬尼刺　頃據自河內抵此之權威消息稱、日軍事代表團與河內法當局、巳簽訂協定、允許日人假道越南運輸軍隊、父外國消息所傳日軍已開始在越南登陸之說、尙無任何官方之證實、關於日軍登陸、此間尙未得河內之消息、惟消息靈通方面謂、縱令日軍確已登陸、此間亦不能獲得直接來自河內之報吿、因法殖民地各主要地點、均有檢查機關也、據河內消息稱、越南已實施軍事警戒、雖官方河內電訊、已稱原則上承認日方若干要求之外交協定、已由法日政府東京及維希兩方面成立、但實施協定之方法、尙在河內討論中云、（六日合衆社電）</p>
<p>重慶　據此間消息靈通方面官稱、越南當局已允日軍一萬二千人在三處地點登陸、（六日路透社電）</p>
<p>重慶　西貢消息雖謂日方已將最後通牒撤回、但華方人士仍繼續注視越南之局勢、據華方消息、法日兩國代表、對於越南方面以若干軍事便利給予日方事、已在維希獲得原則上之妥洽、據華軍當局宣稱、日人現準備越過桂邊、取道鎮南關附近之蘭森（譯音）及同登兩地、攻入滇省、同時華方人士刻正密切注意、萬一日人侵犯越南、英美兩國所持之態度、今晨此間各華字報、對美國務卿赫爾所發關於越南現狀之宣言、均以大字登賊、（六日路透社電）</p>

<p>維希　此間外交部辦公處昨夜宣稱、法日兩國軍事談判、日昨尙在此間進行、以期成立一軍事協定、爲將求日本與安南訂立經濟協約之前奏、外交部發言人曾作解釋、謂法人決不致認日本要求越南海空軍根據地、及日軍通過安南之權限爲哀的美敦、同時、此間中國大使館稱、法日談判之延長、使蔣介石委員長得乘機將華軍移往安南邊界、使該處成爲華軍右翼、該大使館繼稱、日軍卽使得從安南經由紅河海峽、華方亦可保證其決難到達中國領土、而向揚子上游推進云、（六日合衆社電）</p>

<p>重慶　此間大公報載稱、維希政府雖已在原則上允許日軍假道越南、惟聞越南當局堅持嚴格指定日軍所通過之區域、及通過之時限、日本曾要求取銷某項限制、但被越南當局所拒絕、因此日方始有最後通牒之提出、此舉爲東京當局所反對、故終於撇回云、又據昆明電訊、該處與河內之無綫電話、大約可於今日恢復云、（六日路透社電）</p>
<p>倫敦　英外相哈立法克斯昨在上院宣稱、歐洲以外近有可注意之發展、英政府已接到日本軍事使命團向越南提出某種要求之報吿、當卽訓令駐日大華克萊琪、促起日政府對於此種消息之注意、並重伸英政府保持越南狀况之關切、同時美國務卿赫爾亦發表美政府重視越南事件之言論云、（六日路透電）</p>
<p>柏林　據昨日此間消息最靈通德人方面相信、日本曾將其在安南之一切行動及企圖、隨時向德國作正常而詳盡之報吿、故德國對遠東所有秘密、實瞭如指掌、然德國官塲方面、則以目前情形尙未確定、對日本向安南所作之要求、拒絕加以批評、又消息靈通方面相信、日本與德國問之密切友好關係、足以保證安南問題、可得解決、彼等深信、日本對安南所希求之權利、純屬經濟性質、又因對華戰爭必需、亦冀能獲得切實之軍事利益、並無何種土地之野心、此間各方面均認爲日本安南間之關係逐漸進展、結果將與德國對馬爾幹諸國間之關係、同出一轍、現德國視巴爾幹之一部份為其主要之經濟利益范圍云、（六日合衆社電）</p>
<p>重慶　消息靈通方面、頃語合衆社記者、謂越南方面、現有大批日方第五縱隊、從事工作、人數有三千餘、均持有武器、且人數增加甚速、並稱、由日人及附日越人組成之特務人員、均有手槍配</p>
<p>河內　日本代表團、前於本月二日與法屬越南政府當局進行談判時、曾經提出若干迫切要求、以致形勢突趨緊張、但日本監視主任西原少將並未堅持此項要求、因此雙方業於次賡續會談、其主要目標、乃在就法日兩國政府最近在東京听訂閱之外交協定、磋商實施方式、越南總督德古中將、始終與法國政府保持接觸、是以所有交涉經過均曾呈報中樞、至在現行情勢之下、越南當局在軍事方面採取各項預防措置、此乃當然之事、截至目下爲止、越南居民包括法僑與土著在內、莫不異常鎭靜云、（六日哈瓦斯社電）</p>

<h3 id="c3">日海陸軍雙方意見不一致 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>重慶　此間當局對於日本之撤回致越南最後通牒、並不引爲驚奇、蓋信日本從未擬在越南施用武力、此次最後通牒、不過爲一種恫嚇、希望不經戰事卽可使對方讓步而已、此間華方人士意見、皆認為自經道破此項恫嚇後、日本遂決定放棄其侵犯計畫、日前日海相辭職消息傳來、咸以此可認為係日本最高指揮方面意見分歧之第一暗示、據此間華人所接到之情報、日海軍對於陸軍所主張奪取越南計畫、頗表反對、此間人士認爲日海相在日軍提議登陸之前夕、稱病辭職、可暗示海軍方面之決心反對此項政策、消息靈通方面、咸信日海相雖已辭職、但海軍之態將仍無變更、因日海軍對於似將開罪英美之政策、向表反對也、中國消息靈通之軍界人士、皆信日人並不亟欲佔領越南、允共在此常降大雨之時節、卽使日本企圖入侵、大約亦將於十一月初旬氣候較利於大規模之行動時為之、以日人果由龍州西向沿越南邊境進窺昆明、實較取道越南為便捷、華軍發言人頃發表談話、謂日方現集中一第五個師團於龍州區域、向鎭南關移動、法方鐵路交通、聞已繼續照常駛過邊境、此間各觀察家對於日方撤回最後通牒之影響、紛作揣測、若干方面相信、此舉或將使英國對於緬甸公路問題之態度、趨於強硬、荒自法人道破日方之「恫嚇後」英美預料日本不改貿然斥諸武力、故對日態度或將轉趨強硬、又有一部份人士、則以為日本或將在別處新的出人意料之行動、以抵銷越南局勢在國內外所影響者、據此間人士宣稱、尙未獲有德義參加法日談判之消息、（六日路透社電）</p>

<h3 id="c4">上海居住問題之嚴重性 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>上海社會內部之騷攘，其初猶限於中層以下之勞苦階級，近則生活嚴重之影響，已撼動及於一般中上薪工階級之生活。推其由來，食品昂貴，實爲大衆生活致命之打擊，試問人生食用，魚肉鷄鴨可不備；蔬菜果蓏所不能無，乃並此蔬食而亦有望梅止渴之嘆？誰實爲之，孰令致之，豈供求不稱之過歟！抑法幣落値之害歟！是皆皮相之觀，跡象之談；要知苟無所謂統制，則貨運決不如是之艱難阻塞，無所謂外運，則供求決不至如目前之不勻；無所謂橫徵暴歛，則物價決不昂貴至如此地步！然此猶就一部分食用而言也，而今生活問題中困難有不亞於此者，則一般之居住問題是也。</p>
<p>自物價步漲，暴利淌來，可立致巨富，一般擁有房地產者無不眼熱心動，躍躍作加租之打算。加租而不遂訴之於法，訴之於法而無效，則曰翻造打笆勒令他遷，或謂水費昂貴，限制給水，或曰修理無費，任其雨漏風打；一言以蔽之，予房客種種不便，種種留難，以曲從其加租之企圖；如不曲從其主張，則使之一日不得安居，勢非另覓棲止不可。甚至在房屋空閒時，視契約如神聖不可侵犯之房東，今則一手撕毀，有一年加租三四次，有一次所加至七八成者。亦有托名出賣或另換經租帳房而欲重訂契約强迫加租者，其實契約之有效無效，決不隨產權之變遷而有所影響，儘可不理；但至契約期滿仍可誅求如願矣。最可歎者，以房產委託洋商經理，藉「洋」勢以與房客相周旋，房客不允加租，而與房東理論，竟有謂「爾可向領事公堂告去，」抑何喪心病在耶！姑不論煮豆燃萁，豆在釜泣；即以原就被，爾房東即使爲洋商，—何况爲影戤之洋商，亦應向中國法庭去起訴。然而人心至物慾橫流，法理有所不顧，人情有所不惜，但知肥己，不知有人，更不念「肥」之結果，爲利爲害有如何者，善於近謀，拙於遠慮，固不可語於重利輕義之華洋房地產商也。</p>
<p>雖然，房東固可責，亦有房客以房東無饜之誅求，而轉嫁於分租之房客，於是爲之二房東者，莫不趁房東之加租，而大漲其分租之價。以上海租界數百萬人口論，自產自居者，占其少數，賃屋獨居者較衆，但亦不及分租一室以供棲宿者之衆且多也。二房東亦猶大房東然，大房東非皆不良，能知房客之苦痛不願加租者不乏其人。二房東同是僦屋以居，髯不知借屋以居之苦痛，故儘有將房東之所加，照分租房屋之地位大小，比例分攤於房客，是固不失爲一種公允之處置。但不良之二房東，異於是，竟以其所租得之房屋爲營利計，此可就報章召租廣告所見，分租竟有索項費矣；亦有索押租二月三月矣；一統廂房有非百餘金不辦；一前樓或一廂房又非四五十金不租，亭子間灶披間有索租三四十元矣；更聞有三層擱前半間出租，索月租二十元，裝修費二百元者。又據代辦租屋爲營業者言，曾有人租得雙幢住房一所，出月租百餘元，分租之後，月得租益四百八十元，雖曰此係極少數人所爲，但似此大利所在，宜其以分租房屋爲營利事業者愈夥，而不惜項費小費租費務求賃得一屋，以爲分租者愈多，遂使房租頂費小費之數目愈大，正當人士，反有欲求一塵以爲氓有不可得，仍非乞憐於營利目的之二房東不可，此其非分負擔之嚴重，固有不難言喩者矣。</p>
<p>循是之結果奚若，夫旣以營利爲目的，則於「利」之外固有一切不顧者也。窮其弊：（一）則契約承租人之權利，無形加以破壞，從而勒索，從而逼遷，居不得安，席不暇暖，將來勢必以逼走房客爲再三加租之手段，於是而社會之不安愈深矣。（二）房租愈高，物價愈貴，房東（包括大房東二房東而言）之誅求無止足，亦必有一日或竟有以無力付租相對付矣。（三）則房租愈貴，房屋之裝折分割愈多，馴致一幢之內，豈僅「鴿棚，」行且若上古之穴處，蜂窼之共棲已。（四）因房屋之分租愈多，易於發生火災，傳染疫癘，其終極勢將影響及於消防治安，公共衛生。（五）男女雜還，流品雜處，淫風潛滋，惡習默化，將使社會道德，愈趨愈下，而使人羣組織，有根本摧毀之虞。此尙就弊之大者言之，無形之罪惡。尙有不可勝言者也。</p>
<p>然則如何以求補救乎，是不難，「爲政不在多言，顧力行何如耳」！今之爲政言太多，而行不符。如制止房租之上漲，社會未嘗無組織，有之，議論多而事實未見耳！致有目前之狀態。竊以爲民生問題，非利害偏於一隅，而其中牽涉法理之處太多，故宜由政府頒發明令，從雙方利益兼顧之下，而有左列之權宜措施。</p>
<p>（一）各地房租（無論整租或分租）一律法定暫以某月日爲標準，不得再有增加。但此後如有增加捐稅或房租包含有水電費在內，遇水電費增加時，則應就其所增加之數，以公平之比例，分配於租戶負担之，</p>
<p>（二）新造房屋得依其地價及建築成本加以適當之利潤及房屋應有之開支，爲訂定房租之標準，此後除有前條第二項之情事外，不得加租。</p>
<p>（三）租戶將餘屋分租於人者應就分租房屋地位之大小設備之俊劣再從支出之房租加上應有合理之費用，估計訂定該一部分分租房屋應得之租金，分租之租戶，對於租價之保障，亦得適用前兩條之規定。</p>
<p>（四）租戶除積欠房租外，房東不得爲意圖加租或加租不遂，逼令租戶遷移。</p>

<p>倫敦　首相邱吉爾昨在下院略述戰局情形、謂今日英國地位、確較數月前爲佳、此乃國內積極準備及地中海東部有生力軍馳往策應所致、但國民未可視英國被侵之危險業已過去云、首相言及英、美海軍協定表示滿意、謂美國天空與海上邊綫已沿廣闊區域深入大西洋區、而交與英國之五十艘美驅逐艦、可稱補英國戰時程序所造軍艦服務前之缺陷云、首相言及英空戰、謂德空軍受創甚重、以機數言、損失爲三對一、以人數言、損失爲六對一、英空軍數量今較七月爲多、而配備亦較完善、自信能抵禦德方更强大之攻擊、但國人切勿謂侵犯危險現已過去、陸相勸令國人戒備一切實屬相宜、人有謂九月十五日卽希特勒所言之最後侵英日期後、英國可免於海外襲擊之危害者、余不以爲然、雖冬季風雨時作，霧氣迷漫、天氣晦暗、或可改變狀况、惟吾人決不可稍事鬆弛、余謂吾人處境、今較優於七月者、余非洩露任何軍事機密、不過以後英問題在六月間旣感困難、則在九月間當愈覺困難耳、國防佈置已在大規模上向前邁進、吾人已力能陸續遣派援軍前往中東、數日前吾人已遺最强最新之軍艦若干艘開往地中海東部、使該處艦隊力量幾增一倍、此種動作雖爲義方所知、然未爲義方所擾、英艦若干會道出馬爾太、而携有爲防守馬爾太者所需要之若干物、吾人預料中東不久將有惡戰、吾人決定以最大力量、保持吾人在中東之地位、並增進吾人之海權與　　　而赶之　　、此不　　地中海東部如是、卽在地中海西部亦然云、首相言及德機空襲時、謂空襲警報之辦法須大變更、若僅因敵機往來於無人能料之目標而遽每日在廣大區域內作二三次在吼不已之警報、殊屬無用且亦無益、故余擬請各有關行政部重行檢討此事、再街燈問題刻在硏究中、負責各部刻方集議如何可在冬季數月中、使街道較爲明亮、而使行人較爲愉快云、首相末稱、不論有何變化、吾人在國內國外、將沿此途徑前進云、（六日路透社電）</p>
<p>美英合作表滿意</p>
<p>倫教　首相邱吉爾昨在下院歡呼聲中、報吿英美間永可紀念之交換事、謂就余所知、此事完成使英美人民咸大滿意、而世人之爲吾人友者亦將爲之興奮、此事價値可從公文中明白見之、如舍此而求其他意義、則未免錯誤、此次交換純爲兩友國以信任同情與好意的精神彼此互助之計畫、唯無識者始發美艦移交英國乃破壞國際公法的行為之言論、希特勒誠不喜此事、余知希氏茍有機會定將報復美國、英海軍部有此五十艘驅逐艦良用欣然、吾人將儘速使美驅逐艦加入現役、英艦員刻正在交艦之口岸等候接收云、</p>
<p>涉及巴爾幹局勢</p>
<p>首相言及羅國、謂依余個人意見、多不魯甲南部應交還保國、而匈國在上次戰爭中所受之待遇、亦使余不歡、惟戰時所發生之任何土地變更、苟未獲有關係者之自由允許與好意、則吾人不欲承認之、在目前戰事未了時希特勒之帝國將擴張至何處、無人能預言之、但余信此種帝國不久將迅速銷滅云、</p>
<p>英力能應付空戰</p>
<p>首相言及一般空戰、謂七月間空戰大爲活動、但八月尤爲眞正戰月、惟雙方皆未出其全力、德方會作甚大努力欲取天空優勢、其所用之機數較吾人所用以應戰者爲多、其衝破英國空防之企圖已證明代價甚大、飛機三對一、飛行員六對一之損失、尙未包括德方所受之全部損失、吾人必須於本月內準備更劇烈之戰爭、敵方有速戰速了之甚大需要、如希氏果有如吾人前所估計之機數、則應能於九月內加强其攻擊、惟英空軍負責人員確信吾人具有應付大規模空戰之能力、德方宣稱七八兩月英機毀一九二一架實則此兩月英機祗喪失五五八架耳、英飛行家之喪失當然視此更少、余不知希特勒是否相信其自己數字之正確、世人固願見敵人陷於自欺之錯誤中也、</p>

<h3 id="c36">歐戰叢談（三）　開戰前夕　英國民間生活 <a href="#c36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>現代全面戰爭，交戰國全民族的抵抗力如何，持久力如何，對於勝敗的關鍵，影饗甚大。這篇游記是一個美國人歐穆斯堡AmosBurg所作，載於今年八月份美國地理雜誌。他曾在開戰前夕，駕着一艘小划子自倫敦出發，經大運河北上，直至利物浦，沿途經歷，可謂深入英國民間。見聞所及，自非乘飛機火車「走馬看花」者所可同日而語。茲譯錄如下：</p>
<p>客歲夏季，余偕友駕加拿大式小艇「風之歌」號，從倫敦啟椗，循英國最畏運河，經由柏明罕而達利物浦，先後共歷四星期。是行不啻遍游英國後方，從側面獲見英國民族性，察覺運河一帶居民之堅毅生活，固非走馬看花者所能一見者也。</p>
<p>某日淸晨，余佇立倫敦船塢水閘旁，靜候大運河公司發給通行「鑰匙」。余友則駕「風之歌」號，撥槳至商業路水閘前相候，該閘乃我等北行中之第一閘。</p>
<p>所謂鑰匙」者，實是灣曲之鐵搖手，繫以妃色緞結，乃用以開啟無人看守之水閘者。大運河公司某技師鄭重以此搖手授余，並謂須於薄暮前駛過賴墨霍斯區，以免頑童投石滋擾，言畢，鞠躬而退。</p>
<p>時歐戰雖尚未爆發，但大禍已迫在眉睫。大運河縱貫英國中部工業區，馬達船撃曳駁船，載運原料，往來如織，以助英國重整军備。</p>
<p>考英國運河濬於一百五十年前鋼鐵與紡織工業初興時代，用以運輸煤斤機械等笨重貨物，促進工業革命。旣而鐵道問世，遝河失其效用，湮沒無聞者，忽忽百年，其間藉運河運輪之貨物，寥若晨星。</p>
<p>迄十九世紀末葉，公路鐵道貨運過擠，遂分出一部，經由運河輸送，大運河航業始復見起色。一九二九年，舊運河十一條互相溝通，成一大運河，並設公司，負責疏濬修葺，改造新式水閘，耗資殊鉅，錯綜複雜之舊運河乃益完備，嗣受重整軍備之刺激，航運益見發達。</p>
<p>余向大運河公司申請通行證，擬從倫敦航至柏明罕，費時一星期始得之，蓋運河中駁船往返，絡繹不絕，艇行其間，未免有碍交通也。特余自美國奧萊　州擕艇跋步六千哩至英，專誠一游，卒獲許可。</p>
<p>美國人素性急切，滿擬放艇下水，立卽出發。孰意船塢中狹長河道，駁船殊夥，繫泊電力起重　下，爲英國中部各工廠裝卸廢鐵銅鋼，更有種種船舶，縱橫阻梗，我等竟無法駛過船塢，以達運河入口處，終乃靜待翌日侵晨貨運交通開始前，卽趕早出發。</p>
<p>次晨，我等抵船塢，人跡尙稀，惟小艇下水後，貨運已見活動，亟泛艇直駛商業路水闡，向大運河公司領得啟閘搖手，一氣駛過倫敦工業區。</p>
<p>倫敦區運河中駁船，由馬匹曳行者，徐徐前行，每小時兩哩，一日不過十哩。一出倫敦區，馬匹殊少見，駁船皆由馬達「快船」或「飛船」曳行。至柏明罕約六十小時，往時無馬達船，則需時一星期。此等船身，繪以彩色花紋，長七十二呎，闊僅七呎，庶能通過最狹水閘。</p>
<p>船夫水上爲家，老幼皆居船尾油漆彩麗小艙。年幼子女亦助理船務。駁船長舵，闔家輪流掌管，卽小女兒亦能爲之，惟船夫本人，恒忙碌操縱馬達船。</p>
<p>此輩內河船夫，生息於英國運河者約五千人。荒僻區域內少數船夫，無異「水上流民」；惟大運河船夫，辛勤終歲，頗有積蓄，未可以流民呼之。</p>
<p>船夫對過路生客，輕易不喜交談。我等途邁一駁船，繫泊其旁，依船進餐。第見船夫闔家，　　不息。船婦方揩拭艙中甲板，子女則擦銅器，置我等於不顧，一若工作重要，無暇他顧者。</p>
<p>少頃，船夫出外，在船身繪彩色堡壘或玫瑰等圖。終注意我等在其船旁，乃曰：「君船須髹彩色，恰如爲尊夫人添一新裝乎。」</p>
<p>船婦揷言曰：「船髹彩色，應視添新裝尤勤，不然，風雨侵蝕，斑剝如水閘門矣。」</p>
<p>余叩其船身繪以彩色，意義安在。答曰：「無理由，惟駁船無不繪有堡壘與玫瑰。」</p>
<p>余忽億船家有一種迷信，卽駁船皆須繪堡壘圖，否則不免沉失。</p>
<p>船夫復謂，彼有兩孩，每於寄椗時，輒乘隙入校求學數小時，現方候兩孩課畢返船，然後啟椗赴柏明罕，言下頗有得色。蓋英國船家子女，皆於舟行所至，得暇卽在各地求學，可謂別開生面之敎育矣。</p>
<p>邇來電影與無綫電發達，運河船夫與外界隔閡已减除不少。時該駁船艙內無綫電機方奏音樂。船夫曰：「吾人曾收聽英王加冕典禮播音。」</p>
<p>船婦出香茗饗客，並指手劃脚，口述前夜所觀「叛艦喋血記」影片劇情。</p>
<p>未幾，船夫子女歸船，乃解纜離岸，向漆黑一團之依斯林頓隧道駛去，我等亦泛艇相隨。</p>
<p>依斯林頓隧道穿過倫敦人烟稠密之工業區，高上一呎，長逾半哩，用磚砌成，闢於一八一〇年。然隧道上面居民，不知地下有此隧道者，亦大有人在。我等待拖船曳駁船六艘，緩緩駛出後，始撥漿入隧道，向彼端一點微光疾駛。</p>
<p>比抵攝政公園旁，靑翠滿目，胸襟爲之一爽，蓋從啟椗至此，所經工廠船廠，幾達百家，煤灰飛揚，聲音擾雜也。攝政公園中則不然，游人三兩，或緩步綠蔭之下，或去履坦臥草地，悠然自得。假日游人如織，可見英人愛好田野花木之甚，英國南起地角，北迄濃霧迷漫之奧克納羣島，全境如一大花園，保存不遺餘力，卽此種愛好性使然也。</p>
<p>日落時抵巴亭頓池，距出發地可八哩，然仍未出倫敦，亦朱脫離投石區。移時，河旁兒童果紛投石塊，迎頭飛來，我等訴諸一警。孰　警察寬容爲懷，答曰：「此輩幼童，甫離學校，固需稍事活動也。」我等無法，乃避向池中小丘旁。驅散鴨羣，登丘在一簇柳樹間張幕駐足。對面舊式工廠倉庫林立，竟得在倫敦區內張幕而居，言之似可奇也。</p>
<p>英友某君接余電召，偕夫人趕到作划艇戲，偶向河濱孩童發戲言，羣童遽報以磚石泥塊，夾臉擲來，密如雨點。我等被迫駛返小丘，入幕坐下，四週仍有磚石落下，終將帳幕擲倒。</p>
<p>翌晨，解纜前行。美國西部，河流湍急，舟行如箭。英國大運河則絕無潮流可言，惟迎面風力頗強，有吹艇倒退之勢。我等乃倣馬曳駁船之法，各人輪流登岸曳艇，一人坐艇操緃。</p>
<p>旣抵卡窩萊水閘，始出倫敦而入遍地油綠之鄕區。縱目四眺，景色幽靜。農塲處處，茅舍疏落。園林四圍，整齊有緻。乃悟國外英僑思鄉甚切之故。</p>
<p>英國之美，最易在小處見之。各處房屋建造年代不一，或巨石砌成，或半以木架，或覆以茅草，無不美觀動人，與四周景色相諧和。英國對外貿易甲於全球，人烟之密，允稱罕有，其鄕區乃寬曠若此，殆不相稱。</p>
<p>一百五十年前，運河初鑿時，英人視之爲「醜惡的溝壑」。乃在河濱植草木立石牆，以掩此銅臭之「痕跡」。是以我等恒駛於兩行樹木之間，一片綠蔭，不見兩旁農　村落者，歷數哩之遙，祗得攀登河岸，一觀　偷風光。（未完）</p>

<p>敎部最近發表關於專科以上學校學生程度、較之過去雖略見提高、然各專科以上學校質量上之發展、尙未能盡與數量上之發展相應合、茲爲提高專科以上學校學生程度、謀高等敎育質量之改進起見、特訂定專科以上學校學生學業成績考核辦法要點如下、</p>
<p>（一）臨時試騐每學期內至少須舉行一次、該項試卷由校妥爲保存、在一年以內、本部得隨時令飭調閱、或於派員視察時、按照課程抽閱之、</p>
<p>（二）學生平時聽講筆錄讀書札記、以及練習實習實騐等報吿、應與臨時試驗分別合併核計、作爲平時成績、調閱方法與前條同、</p>
<p>（三）學期試騐應於每學期之末嚴格實施、不得提早舉行學期試驗成績、並須與平時成績合併核計、作爲學期成績、</p>
<p>前項學期試騐成績、須依照規定於學期終了時、造冊呈部備核、本部並得隨時抽閱某科試卷、</p>
<p>（四）學期試騐不及格科目在四十　分以上不滿六十分者、得予補考、但以一次爲限、其不滿四十分者、不得補考、應令重讀、如不及格科目之學分數、逾該學期修習學分總數三分之一以上者、應令留級、逾二分之一以上者、應令退學、</p>
<p>（五）畢業試騐改為總考制、除考試最後一學期科目四種以上（專科學校及專修科五種以上）至少須有兩種（專科學校及專修科三種）包含全學年之課程外、並須通考其以前各年級所習專門主要科目三種以上不及格者、不得畢業、</p>
<p>前項畢業試騐科目、須於呈報應屆畢業生時報部核定、</p>
<p>（六）畢業試騐委員會及學生畢業論文（專科學校及專修科無需畢業論文）務須依照大學規程及修正專科學校規程之規定嚴格實施、</p>
<p>自本學期起、各該校應依照以上各項規定辦法嚴格實施、</p>

<p>（大華社）本市實施義務敎育、始於二十四年度、七七事變以後、受戰事影響、一度陷於停頓、迨二十六年度第一學期起、則又恢復施行、最近一年來、更有驚人之發展、據本市義務敎育協進會發言人宣稱、</p>
<p>適應需要　循序推進</p>
<p>抗戰以還、滬市敎育、賴政府當局督導有方、敎育人員艱苦支撐、以及事實需要之驅使、非僅未見停頓、且有長足進展、關於義務敎育方面、尤因戰時影饗、難民兒童、麕集滬上、社曾經濟、日趨衰落、普通敎育經費、已非貧苦家庭听能負擔、故其需要更較其他教育爲迫切、敎育當局爲救濟是項苦難兒童、使有求學機會起見、爰自二十六年度起、力圖義敎事業之恢復、雖因絀於經費、亦仍循序推進、迄於今日、乃能蔚爲大觀、</p>
<p>質量並進　前途樂觀</p>
<p>以數量言、兒童義教方面、共設短期小學三百三十餘級、容納兒童一萬五千以上成人義敎方面、共設民衆學校三十餘級、容納成人一千三百左右、從事義敎工作人員、幾達四百人之多、較之戰前原有事業、非特未見减少、且激增至一倍以上、以實質言、舉凡行政敎學訓導諸項、均訂有具體辦法、全市統一施行、本學期起、且於課程之釐訂、敎材之供給、行政管理之改善、視察指道之推進、試有週密之計畫、務以最少之經費、獲得最大之效果、遙矚前途、殊堪樂觀、</p>
<p>急公好義　熱心贊助</p>
<p>至其所以能獲此成績者、一方面由於教育當局之擘畫周詳、一方面尤賴敎育人士之熱心贊助、而得力於後者爲尤多、蓋因義敎經費、萬分支絀、校舍校具、不能不借自原有之學校、幸各校當局咸能深體義敎推行之重要、各方多予以便利、平均每一借用之敎室、每月僅支房租計水電六元左右、此種急公好義之精神、不特爲本會所欽佩、亦値得全市市民之崇敬、雖有少數學校、一時未能顧及義敎經費之困難、而未能予以便利、但本會深信此種不幸現象、不久卽可消滅、</p>
<p>生活淸苦　提高待遇</p>
<p>至義敎人員之生活、困苦異常、每月收入、恒不足維持一己之生活、遑論仰事與俯蓄、値此百物昂貴之秋、尤感無法維持、所幸自本學期起、每級每月經費已略提高、主任薪額規定爲二十八元、敎員薪額規定爲二十四元幷以雜支收入（每生每學期規定爲四角）撥充辦公費用、經此提高標準以後、教職員之待遇、平均可增加百分之二十左右、雖杯水車薪、然亦不無小補、所望全市義敎人員、共體時、艱减低物質上之享受、爭取精神上之安慰、敎育前途、實利賴之云、</p>

<p>紊亂之米市、昨日稍見澄清、良以港越航運禁令取銷、大批洋米陸續運到、店銷以價已越限、門市亦難推銷、故鮮問津、懷貨者心思因之較懈、除對高檔洋米以前暗盤曾有六十六七元之喊聲、尙無出樣外、其他中段貨已頗多依評價開出、但操縱搗把者尙未肯死心、而行囤大戶亦仍在望高價來臨、故未來市面、稍有風吹草動、卽易變動、昨以匯水回長、人心再變、一部獲利多頭亦乘機求脫、市上突見賣風旺盛、行情逐喊逐低、頓時下瀉三四元、價小後又有趁低問津、市乃再度回好一元左右、結果較前日小二三元、然與公開限價尙差一二元、市上正式公布者仍祇中關各米而已、回籠原包二號西貢前開七十五六元者、昨亦降至七十三四元、且有七十一元之中貨正式售開云、</p>
<p>糯粳國米、則以內地破磐存底日薄、昨到仍祇七八百　、　雖明暗市交易、傳聞相率轉懈、卒以貨主堅持、而得站守原盤、未有榮辱、所開之價悉與前相仿也、</p>
<p>新　仍僅到周浦貨三十二担、售價未起變化、開六十九元半至六十九元、太倉新羊尖因一般搬運者聞滬市奔騰、羣謀趕市、由脚踏車運來突旺、不下三十餘石、但銷塲因洋米回平、忽亦轉淡、搬運者際此旣以新貨身骨軟弱、不易守俟、祇得鬆脫、所以行情略貶近元、原包開六十三四元、斛見六十一元左右云、</p>

<p>麵粉　昨市日廠粉鳳凰牌期貨交易、尙稱活躍、而市面已轉疲風、多頭亦有回出、惟客戶仍有趁低吸進者、市面所跌有限、計開鳳凰現貨十四元六角、九月份十五元至十四元九角、十月份十五元三角半、成交五千餘包、比前均跌一角至角半、內地粉及洋粉交易俱靜、本廠粉產量减少後、本銷需要不弱、故市面反見暗緊、回籠貨比廠盤暗高二三角、與日廠粉趨勢互異云、</p>
<p>小麥　昨日交易又趨沉靜、因連日到貨甚少、而運入租界者、更爲寥落、出口帮一度收買後、進胃尙貪、惜乎無貨可購、華廠亦然如此、惟日廠仍以二十二元至二十一元半之價收進車船各麥三四千包、又聞本街園坊收進蘇錫麥五六千包、價爲二十五元五角、市面又成漲跌兩難之局、</p>

<p>昨日油市塲中之波濤、已告平息、且大局已呈下游、因傳花生油路貨已運到萬餘件、致人心不振、市氣鬆濫、期油甩跌二元、現貨跟跌元譜、豆油因之亦小、共計做開大連豆油二十桶、價爲一百元至九十九元五角、靑島豆油三十桶、價爲九十七元、及大有廠豆油二百担、價爲七十六元五角、浦東廠豆油一百桶、價爲七十六元五角、花生油成交膠州現油五十件、價爲六十五元、計九月下交二百件、價爲六十二元五角至六十二元、十月上交四百五十件、價爲六十三元至六十二元五角、十月下交四百五十件、價爲六十三元五角至六十三元云、</p>

<p>投機繼續猛塞</p>
<p>晨　以倫敦大條、近遠期均平、倫敦生金呆定、滙兌英劉美不動、對滬亦平、對法無市、美對英未更、對滬大三分、對法無市、中央掛牌各滙如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金三辦士四六八七五、美滙五元二五、較之上日收市、英平美緊〇三一二五、開後投機商首來吐售、潛勢吿鬆、計塞予外行滙豐及美行等九月份美滙山五元二五至五元三七五、又華行賣出現先令價爲三辦士半、滙豐掛脾揭曉勿動、白銀平衡稅揭曉亦無增减、此後華商投機家轉扒遠期美滙、價尙平穩、計入外行十月份美滙五元三一二五、又又進本月美滙五元三四三七五及二八一二五、乃因買意濃厚勢復回緊、迨近午刻、則又微硬、計華商投機家向有利結進本月份美滙五元三一二五、收盤英金三辦士四八四三七五、美滙五元三一二五、比晨開英長〇一五六二五、美終硬〇六二五、</p>
<p>滙豊限價吸收</p>
<p>午後市面、再吿鬆動乃投機家傾向售出、初美行吸進九月份美滙五元三四三七五、後美行欲賣、缺乏對手、惟五元三七五滙豐尙有吃胃、收盤英金三辦士半、美滙五元三四三七五、十月份英金三辦士四八四三七五、美櫃五元三一二五、較之隔昨收市、英金期現各長〇三一二五、美滙均鬆〇六二五、</p>

<p>烚赤軋小七十元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初以滙市報鬆、人氣散漫無勁、開時賣者頗多、遂被撳小八十五元、金號出銀號三十兩、爲六千一百五十元、繼賴金號及銀號帮乘低頗有吃胃、且斯時散戶亦進、不久回升六十元、銀號互做五十兩、昂爲六千二百十元、卒因外滙鬆動、錢兌業及某銀號互相猛售、重小至六千一百六十元、後以滙市走勢稍轉、現金號忽來拖入、復見漲達六千二百〇五元、旋滙市重鬆、賣風復起、證券帮及無力浮多、爭先吐售、且某金號仍有拋出、一度市勢頗疲、慘降至六千一百〇五元低價、午刻多頭了結罄盡、證券帮忽趁低補空、且現金號亦跟進不少、收盤前回升至六千百七十五元、惟收市則吿六千一百六十元、午後開時頗佳、金號進銀號十兩、爲六千一百八十元、嗣又升起十餘元、錢兌業進金號二十兩、爲六千一百九十五元、此後市勢忽轉下疲、因外滙帶鬆、及公債報漲、致有產生和平謠言、銀號帮拋空頗力、未幾曾退至六千百三十五元、入後證券帮出來維持、收盤尙有六千百六十五元、結果比上日軋小七十元、塲外市况仍吿疲軟、六千百五十元有少數成交、全天一百〇五元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤較高小數元、收進减低三十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十餘元、均鮮做開、</p>
<p>飾金再掛小十元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、初時大同行仍懸六百四十元、迨九時半掛小十元、此後則無變動、結果大同行改懸六百三十元、新同行與上價相同、收進减低三十元光景、</p>

<p>孫玄　將五分一分兩券暗記劃出、與王蘭香君所言相同、惟其地位指點明白、五分券之「中」字暗記、在右下角五分之伍字上、第二樹之根下、「五」字則隱在二十八年之年字上角、塔右第六樹之下、一分票之「中」字暗記、亦在左首兩樹之根問、「央」在二十八年字樣之左、廻文尖角之上、塔右第六樹之根部、</p>

<p>滬西愚園路七四九號弄口、於昨晨九時十分許突發生重大槍擊案、有暴徒兩名、意圖加害工部局警務處政治部副主任英籍姚克（Ｒ.Ｗ.Ｙorke）、幸姚氏機警、一面亟予躱避、一面拔槍還擊、雙方發槍多饗、均未命中、暴徒等卒竄入人叢中逃逸、有一匪當被日憲兵拘獲、惟姚之八四七四號汽車葉子板等處、均洞穿多穴、茲將各情探悉於次、</p>
<p>任職有年勇敢幹練</p>
<p>工部局警務處政治部副主任英人姚克、現年四十八歲、服務於警務處垂二十七年、辦事幹練、剛毅勇敢、以故深得上峯器重、其家稅居於滬西愚園路匕四九弄七號洋房內、於昨晨九時十分許、姚氏自寓所外出、身御西裝、循例赴警務處處理要公、乘坐自備汽車租界號碼八四七四號、司機者爲工部局警務處五號王姓、</p>
<p>預伏暴徒開槍狙擊</p>
<p>當姚氏步登入車廂內　遂由司機者撥動引擎向前駛去、甫出弄口時、突有年約三旬御白法蘭絨西裝之暴徒兩名、預伏於該處、瞥見姚之汽車開出、均拔出新式盒子砲、向姚之汽車開槍襲擊、連發十餘槍、彈似聯珠、兩彈中左面車門、一彈適軋在門縫中、另一彈洞穿左葉子板、斯時姚氏睹狀、並不慌張、亟於車中拔出公務手槍還擊、計開七槍於是一塲格鬭頓起、</p>
<p>雙方互轟並無傷亡</p>
<p>當塲子彈紛飛、劈拍之聲宛如燃放鞭砲、行人爭相奔避、但結果雙方均未命中、旋暴徒等見勢不妙、囊械竄逃、有一匪後被日本憲兵所獲、拘入司令部究辦嗣靜安寺捕房聞警、亟派大批中西探捕馳往兜拿、奈匪跡已杳、遂在出事地點檢獲彈壳多枚、帶回捕房研究、事後工部局當局對此案甚爲重視、巳着捕房嚴密偵查、</p>
<p>姚克自述禦暴經過</p>
<p>姚克又向英文大美晚報記者述其遇險經過如下、余（姚克自稱）甫乘車出衖、見前有兩東方人、當車抵兩人前、相去五至七碼時、忽見其一伸手入袋、余立卽檢起身畔座墊上之手槍、其人舉槍放射、余亦決定還擊、另一人繞至車後開槍、車夫賡續駛車出街、車前開槍者遂飛奔出衖、沿愚園路向兆豐公園西奔不出二十碼、卽遭日憲兵一名攔住、奪下手槍押去、另一人則不知去向、槍擊時、衖中別無行人、余所携手槍、子彈放盡、並未多携槍彈、故出事後卽赴靜安寺捕房報吿一過、然後賡續辦公、兩行兇者皆穿潔白法蘭絨西裝、年約三旬云、</p>
<p>各方慰問慶賀脱險</p>
<p>據檢視姚克汽車所悉、該車照會八四七四號、有彈孔三處、其一貫穿左擋泥板、餘二孔在左側後門、姚克遇狙擊時、方坐車後座左側、一彈貫穿後門、射入座墊、距姚克僅三吋許、昨晨姚克接各方電話慰問、並賀其晚險、按姚克服務警務處、乙逾二十七年、頗負聲譽、前管理「乙」警區、約三年前、調長特別科、原籍英國諾丁漢、今年四十八、約三十年前來滬、</p>

<p>米糧評價委員會、於昨日下午三時、召開常務委員會議、法租界公董局暨上海市商會均派代表出席監視、並到全體委員、首由主席報吿開會宗旨後、旋由市塲管理委昌張利忠報吿市塲同業買賣情形、後由米號業公會代表瞿振華一再主張不得將米價冉行評高、並建議嚴厲取締市塲暗盤、及各委員紛紛發表意見、一時情勢頗爲緊張、其大意卽、（一）一號洋米在市塲已未見貨樣、（二）希望維持原有限價、（三）以後米糧成交、須邀同兩租界當局暨上海市商會代表會同簽說、（四）維持原限價、應請兩當局曁上海市商會作有效之援助、</p>
<p>維持評價</p>
<p>該會昨評價結果、決維持本月三日評定之最高價格、並於今晨公吿市塲嚴厲執行云、「爲公吿事、本委員會於本月六日召集常會、討論洋米市價、當經議決、秉承兩租界當局意旨、堅決維持本月三日評定之價格、公告市塲切實遵守、嚴厲防制暗盤等情事、如有故違、任人舉發、卽當陳請當局從嚴懲處等語、除函報兩租界當局外、合亟錄案指示、務希一體週知爲要、特此公吿、附開九月三日評定價格、計一號西貢暹羅六十一元五角、火紋六十一元、二號西貢暹羅五十九元、小絞五十八元五角、高東京臼米五十六元、東京糙米五十二元、米菉五十元、混合碎四十六元、」</p>
<p>回風突起</p>
<p>上海至海防間航運前日已吿恢復、各航輪公司亦着手派輪行駛、自該項消息公諸報端後、投機米商不無晴天霹靂、咸認滬防通航、米糧來源可蟬聯抵埠、人心一致趨疲、大戶抑價求脫、昨晨米行茶會市塲開市後、初市卽吿疲落、現貨充斥、供過於求、銳跌三四元左右、是則米蠧前數日之故意超越限價、不言可喩、前日江西路通成公司由西貢運來洋米一萬六千包、業於昨日卸貨進棧、並今日將有西貢洋米三萬二千包到埠、故本市米糧存底、勢將愈見充實、整個民食決無匱乏之虞、</p>
<p>被捕米蠧</p>
<p>日米業市况、因被投機者操縱大宗食米、致米價頻頻高漲、兩租界警務當局卽加派人員、分駐市塲、監視各行號在塲買賣、前晨有米蠧陳榮山者、卽浙江路億泰米號經理、向中匯大樓聚豐米行（其代理人爲毛戩遂）購進二號暹羅洋米若干、由掮客莫錦庭居間成交、其成交價格爲六十一元七角一石（按限價爲五十九元、）當塲由東新橋元和成代理人、陶仲高向駐塲警探報吿、乃被扭往中央捕房、經分別訊究、外傳當日下午五時予以釋放、恐不確、想當局決不致如此輕易放縱、</p>

<p>供給不匱</p>
<p>大陸報云、法租界公董局某員昨（五日）告記者稱、工部局公董局與「市府」聯合調整上海區民食供給與米價之努力、已獲滿意結果、該員相信目下米糧之供給、一如己往、且上海現可獲得史多之西貢米供給、歐戰前、法國年向越南購米約八十萬噸、今因船隻缺乏、米糧未能運歐、必在遠東另覓銷路也、法租界內米麵等重要食物、存貨充足、</p>
<p>毋庸恐慌</p>
<p>故米麵漲價而居民深恐糧荒、實無理由、三月一日成立之法租界平價委員會、志在遏制零躉批發商操縱居奇與濫抬價格、並隨時協助商人、補充存貨、爲求統制物價奏效計、平價委員會已得毘連區行政當局之合作以利居民、平價委員會成立後、每週集會一次、工部局粉食小組委員會亦派代表與會云、</p>

<p>向聞鄂省陋俗有驢妻一說，蓋人家每於娶婦前十餘日或數日先娶驢妻。其法以牝驢一頭，洗濯淸潔，以紅氈加諸驢身，而簪金花於驢首，乘龍佳婿，具衣冠交拜天地祖考，夜入洞房，驢繫房中，婿臥床上，嗣後家人輩視驢爲少主婦，永無鞭撻服御之加也。茲聞嶺南有雞娶一事，洵稱的對。嶺南番順鄕僻，有聘妻未娶出洋貿易者；及其長也，夫猶未歸，遂有雞娶之禮。法選雄雞一頭，至吉日率新婦與之交拜，一如湖北驢妻狀，而新婦遂居夫家，奉事翁姑。前月番禺鄉落何某，有一子，訂婚於鄕村莫姓，年十六，從人作賈於新加坡，迄今五載不歸，婦已年長，父循俗例而行雞娶之法。至吉日，新婦輿至，家人乃於籠中率雞交拜，不虞觸手而倒，蓋嘐嘐者，已作冥其之遊矣。一時家人賀客，莫知所措，遂棄其雞，祇新婦一人，草草行禮。是時媼嫗等流言四作，謂新郞在外，恐有不吉之事。觀其景象，有不勝捧腹者！諺云：嫁雞隨雞」，其此之謂歟。</p>

<p>— 劉簣</p>
<p>樓下灶披間的兒子死了。那剛好會跳會笑，五六歲的孩子。</p>
<p>我下樓，看見裏邊地下橫鋪着一條布被，花鮮色的；假如沒有悲苦陣哭的女人在尖喊，揚起蓬髮，淚如鞭創地把她的面臉創開；也許有人以爲這是誤掉下來的被單。</p>
<p>門口沉悶地半圍着人，靜悄悄的。</p>
<p>街外，烏黑的一團在張望；我看到幾個這小孩的玩友，瞪起大黑的眼睛，好像對這悲苦的尖哭有點驚駭。</p>
<p>不久，從門外湧進愴惶的父親，這工人把草帽子向後一掀，排開已經開了胸扣的衣衫。露出壯健的胸膛。望望瘋哭的妻和地下的孩子，俯下來要揭開布被的手，在一觸之下又抬起。嘴旁，在衆目共睽之下異樣地張縐一下，像是喝過苦澀的酒。</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>死，本來在這裏算得是什麽大事？</p>
<p>弄裏，除了凍死餓死的乞丐不算，一季差不多就有三五個藍紫的死嬰丟在路旁。</p>
<p>然而抱過死孩子的人在開始用火條把自己的身體都繞遍了。揮舞着洒落得如魔術班舞火棒的人，而且口裏還念念有詞，像念什麼咒語，怕死對她有一點留戀。……</p>
<p>其實，死，眞的算得是什麽一回事呢？</p>
<p>孩子跑開了，就玩去了。有一個抱着嬰兒的母親，雖然、面孔在當時變靑了，然而到弄堂口時便和柔地唱起催眠歌來。</p>
<p>在死去的孩子，也算是免了一塲苦難吧，他是永遠安息了，免去街上許多體面孩子給與他的欺侮，免去有時給父母在憤怒下打駡。在這年頭，打駡孩子的哭聲比物價還漲得高呢！</p>
<p>死，或許只給與現在飮泣着的母親以痛苦，而過幾月，一兩年間，待她重又再生孩子，便當又得無限歡愉了。</p>
<p>據說孩子的死只是幾個鐘點內的事。患的是許多散藥與醫生都能救治的驚風。</p>
<p>然而死了。</p>
<p>「……街坊正在打太平公蘸呢，這孩子倒算會死。」一個纏過脚的老太婆拿着命定的念珠喃喃地說。</p>
<p>我想：人就是亂生亂死的，自古來到現在。誰會定確這孩子將來會成爲一個怎樣的人呢？這淸秀的臉兒眼睛是聰慧的。然而他死了。留下那年靑婦人底抽咽。</p>
<p>而幽怨的抽咽聲也有寂靜了的時候呀！</p>
<p>左祝黎的一篇小說裏，曾想像過，要有：「市民生存嚴格審査委員會」去審判市民是否合於生存；而判使不適於生存的市民限於二十四小時內自行畢命的事。</p>
<p>現在，有多少該死的人未有死啊！</p>

<p>— 蘇人節譯</p>
<p>亞歷山大到了一個非洲的鄉村裏，酋長很殷勤的招待他，把金的果子和麵包，放在他面前。亞歷山大很奇怪的問道，『你們這兒，是吃金子的嗎？』</p>
<p>『我想，您一定能在自己的國家裏，找到吃的東西。除了金子，你爲了什麼到這裏來呢？』酋長回答道。</p>
<p>『你們的金子，不能引我到這裏來的。——』亞歷山大說：『但我願意知道些你們的風俗習慣。』</p>
<p>正在這時，二個土人進來了，先向酋長深深地鞠躬，第一個開口道：『我向他買了一塊地，掘陰溝時忽然發現了一個寳藏，我向他買的時候，並沒有把這寳藏買在裏邊，所以這應該是他的，但他却不接受。』</p>
<p>第二個答道，『我希望我有好良心和他們一樣。我賣這塊地，自然連一切都包括在內，這個寳藏該是他的。』</p>
<p>酋長低頭沉思了一會，便問道，『你有兒子嗎：』</p>
<p>『有的。』</p>
<p>酋長又向另外一個：『你有女兒嗎？』</p>
<p>『有的。』</p>
<p>『好』酋長判決道：『你的兒子娶了他的女兒，就把這個寳藏給他們這對新夫婦做妝奩。』</p>
<p>亞歷山大在旁看了，非常覺得驚異。酋長見了便問道：「你難道覺得我的判決不對嗎？」　『噢，不，但我很覺詫異。』亞歷山大回答。</p>
<p>『那末，在你的國家裏對於這種事怎樣判決呢！』酋長又問。</p>
<p>『說老實話，我們這個寳藏沒收，送給皇帝。』</p>
<p>現在輪到酋長驚異起來了他聽後大聲的叫道：『給皇帝用麼？——那邊有太陽嗎？』</p>
<p>『有的。』</p>
<p>『那邊下雨嗎？』</p>
<p>『當然囉！』</p>
<p>『奇怪！但那邊有吃草的動物麽？』</p>
<p>「很多，各種種類都有。」</p>
<p>『呵！那便對了。』酋長恍然大悟地說：『為了這些無辜的動物，上帝才肯繼續讓太陽光和雨點落在你們的國境裏面。』</p>

<p>第六章　危險的經歷</p>
<p>倪金壽連連點頭，應道：「這個都容易。要不要馬上就辦——」</p>
<p>倪金壽的話沒有說完，他的右手也已伸到書桌旁邊的電鈴鈕上，正待按鈴叫外面的聽差進來。不料辦公室的門上又有咯咯兩下，有一個穿制服的聽差已自動推行進來，手中拿着一張名片。倪金壽接了名片一瞧，嘴裏念着：「陸健笙。」他抬頭向霍桑瞧瞧，似在詢問要不要接見。霍桑想了一想，便點點頭。倪金壽也把同樣的動作，引渡給那個聽差。</p>
<p>一分鐘後，那個昂着頭，挺著大肚子的陸健笙踱進來了。他的個子相當高大，圓胖的臉兒，又白又嫩。他的頭發雖已有些禿頂，看去總有五十開外的年紀，却並沒有衰老的樣子。他有一個平扁的大鼻子，兩條稀疏的淡眉，一雙靈活的眼睛，似乎很工心計。其實這一副眼睛眞是他的唯一的法寳，發威，獻媚，隨機應變，他一定都能運用自如。當他踱進來的時候，他的眼睛似乎正安排在「發威」的機鈕上。他身上穿一件淡灰薄花呢的袍子，脚上穿一雙漆黑發光的皮鞋。我一瞧見他這雙皮鞋，心頭不覺跳了一跳，它的足寸相當大，而且是圓頭式的。</p>
<p>當他走進來時，倪金壽已很恭敬地站了起來，招呼了一聲「陸先生請坐。」陸健笙却祇點了點頭。這點頭的動作，那頭的前後的距離，至多不過二吋，而且依舊是昂着的。他的右手的食指和中指之間，夾着一支雪茄，順手揚了一揚，便在我們對面那隻白布套的沙發上坐下來。霍桑祇把眼角向那人瞥了一瞥，仍抱着右膝坐着，我也不曾起立。陸健笙也不跟我們招呼，好像祇有人家招呼他，他是照例不先招呼人家的。</p>
<p>他乾咳了一聲，開始向倪金壽說：「怎麼樣？兇手找到了沒有？」</p>
<p>倪金壽呆了一呆，才坐下來答道：「陸先生，這案子很複雜，我還不知道誰是兇手——」</p>
<p>陸健笙那雙發威的眼睛又增加了些威的原素。「什麽？還不知道誰是兇手？你們忙了半天，幹些什麽事？」</p>
<p>我覺得「你們」的字樣，好像把我和霍桑也包括在裏面。我心中有些兒着惱。霍桑却讓眼睛半開半閉地，好像在養神，絕沒有什麽表示。倪金壽有些尷尬了。他向霍桑瞅了一眼，又回過去瞧陸健笙。這時有個聽差托着盤送四杯茶進來，分別放在四個人的面前，重新走出去，總算把這緊張的空氣减弱了一下。</p>
<p>倪金壽說道：「陸先生，這案子裏牽涉的人不止一個。我和霍先生和包先生——唉，我來介紹一下，這一位是霍桑先生，這一位是包朗先生——」（九九）</p>

<p>這件事的五十週紀念會，是在斯丹福大學舉行的，許多影片企業家，都參加盛會，阿萊克皮佛郞雪代表影人們演說，他說：他對這第一隻照的馬Ouident表示敬意，在草地上立了一塊碑，紀念這最先的成功者。</p>

<p>— 唯唯</p>
<p>最近一年黃金所邀的京朝派名伶，雖然頭牌角兒源源而來，然而配角方面，武生總是吳彥衡高盛麟，花臉總是裘盛戎袁世海，其他一切，也不外乎葉盛簡馬富祿貫盛習艾世菊這些常見的面孔，於是很可能的使觀衆懷疑，所謂名伶出產地的北平，除掉這些人之外。或許沒有別的人了。其實故都人才濟濟，何嘗如此，不過有不少名伶，不是架子大就是脾氣怪，以致很少南來的機會。現在黃金方面，預備打破這層難關，想在這些不肯輕易南來的名伶中，邀聘幾個。據說目前已經有兩位名伶在和黃金方面談判着，那就是侯喜瑞和茹富蘭。</p>
<h3 id="c98">侯喜瑞　被邀南來 <a href="#c98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>侯喜瑞是富連成唯凈角人才，不但富連成所產生的一般凈角，都學他，而且他是當今三大凈角之一。論藝術，除掉嗓音不及郝金外，武功工架臉譜氣魄，都在郝金二人之上。侯喜瑞全盛時代，一個人在故都搭上六家班子，梅（蘭芳）楊（小樓）程（硯秋）尙（小雲）都視他如左右手，計得末一次喜瑞來滬，是和梅蘭芳同來的，到現在已有十幾個年頭；此後程硯秋兩度邀他南來，均未成事實，一則因爲他不願南來，二則因爲他架子過大，一個人要帶九個伙計，使戲院老闆聽了搖頭，以致影響到江南人仕十數年來沒有機會看到這位藝人。現在黃金方面，派人在平接洽小翠花，同時更以十分誠意邀聘侯喜瑞。</p>
<h3 id="c99">茹富蘭　準可到滬 <a href="#c99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>茹富蘭也是富連成的榤出人才，他本來是學武小生的，後來出科改應武生，最近幾年，因為目患近視，不宜演武戲，重由武生改應小生，論富蘭之藝，頗有獨到，其傑作如「戰濮陽」「八大錘二探莊」「夜奔」在今日梨園中，堪稱手屈一指，葉盛蘭之武戲，悉得自富蘭，故盛蘭之「戰濮陽」「八大錘一等戲亦能負盛名也。武生一行，自楊小樓後，周瑞安孫毓堃茹富蘭三人，同爲楊派繼起之人物。今瑞安已漸入老境，毓堃富蘭則俱在壯年，雖然以大體論，富蘭或有小及毓堃之處，但以後起一般武生視富蘭則又望塵莫及矣。黃金前次邀李盛藻時，卽有邀富蘭之意，惜因富蘭不肯應小生，而未成事實。現在舊事重提，已決定邀他應武生，隨小翠花或新艷秋同來，此事大概可無問題。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Report of Military Agreement Signed: Vietnamese Authorities Permit Japanese Troops to Pass Through; British Foreign Secretary Expresses Extreme Concern Over the Situation in Vietnam; Four Japanese Ministers Hold Meeting to Discuss New Southern Advance Policy <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Manila: According to authoritative sources arriving here from Hanoi, an agreement has been signed between the Japanese military delegation and the French authorities in Hanoi, permitting the Japanese to transport troops through Vietnam. However, foreign reports that Japanese troops have already begun landing in Vietnam have not been officially confirmed. Hanoi has not yet reported on the Japanese landing. However, well-informed sources say that even if the Japanese have indeed landed, direct reports from Hanoi may not be available because all major locations in the French colony have inspection agencies. According to Hanoi sources, Vietnam has implemented military alert measures. Although official Hanoi telegrams have stated that a diplomatic agreement in principle, acknowledging certain Japanese demands, has been established between the French and Japanese governments in Tokyo and Vichy, the methods for implementing the agreement are still under discussion in Hanoi. (United Press report, 6th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: According to official sources here, the Vietnamese authorities have permitted 12,000 Japanese troops to land at three locations. (Reuters report, 6th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Although reports from Saigon say that the Japanese have withdrawn their ultimatum, Chinese observers continue to monitor the situation in Vietnam. According to Chinese sources, French and Japanese representatives have reached a preliminary agreement in Vichy regarding the granting of certain military facilities in Vietnam to the Japanese. According to Chinese military authorities, the Japanese are now preparing to cross Guibian (桂邊) and enter Yunnan Province via Lansen (蘭森, transliteration) and Tongdeng (同登) near Zhennanguan (鎮南關). At the same time, Chinese observers are closely watching the attitudes of Britain and the United States should the Japanese invade Vietnam. This morning, all Chinese newspapers here prominently featured U.S. Secretary of State Hull's statement regarding the situation in Vietnam. (Reuters report, 6th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: "Kokumin Shimbun" reports that the Japanese Prime Minister, Foreign Minister, Army Minister, and Navy Minister have decided to adopt a strong policy regarding Vietnam, regardless of any foreign statements. "Asahi Shimbun" also reports that Japanese Prime Minister Konoe, Foreign Minister Matsuoka, Army Minister Tojo, and newly appointed Navy Minister Oikawa held a two-hour meeting to discuss Japan's new southern advance policy. (United Press report, 6th)</p>
<p>Vichy: The Foreign Ministry office here announced last night that French-Japanese military talks were still in progress yesterday, aiming to establish a military agreement as a prelude to Japan and Annam (Vietnam) concluding an economic pact. A Foreign Ministry spokesperson explained that France will not consider Japan's demands for naval and air bases in Vietnam and the right for Japanese troops to pass through Annam as an ultimatum. Meanwhile, the Chinese Embassy here stated that the extension of French-Japanese talks allows Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to take the opportunity to move Chinese troops to the Annam border, making it the right flank of the Chinese army. The embassy continued that even if Japanese troops were to advance from Annam via the Red River Strait, the Chinese side can guarantee that they would find it difficult to reach Chinese territory and advance upstream along the Yangtze River.

<p>Saigon: Maritime traffic between Vietnam and Eastern ports, which was temporarily suspended due to recent tensions between France and Japan, resumed as usual yesterday. (Reuters report, 6th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Foreign Ministry spokesperson Suma, when hosting a press interview today, claimed that the Japanese government has ordered General Nishihara, head of the Japanese Supervisory Group stationed in Vietnam, to conduct negotiations with the French authorities in Vietnam in a peaceful and orderly manner. He also stated that the United States has no reason to be alarmed about the situation in Vietnam. He had read U.S. Secretary of State Hull's statement on the matter on Wednesday and emphatically stated that the Japanese government does not wish to respond to Hull's statement. (Reuters report, 6th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Suma recently told the press that French-Japanese negotiations are progressing peacefully and that there is no reason to be alarmed about the situation in Vietnam. Suma also said that he was unaware of foreign reports of Japanese troops landing in Hanoi. (United Press report, 6th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: The "Ta Kung Pao" here reports that although the Vichy government has in principle allowed Japanese troops to pass through Vietnam, it is reported that the Vietnamese authorities insist on strictly specifying the areas through which Japanese troops may pass and the time limit for passage. Japan requested the cancellation of certain restrictions but was rejected by the Vietnamese authorities, which led to the Japanese ultimatum. This action was opposed by the Tokyo authorities and was therefore withdrawn. Furthermore, according to Kunming telegrams, the wireless telephone connection between that city and Hanoi is expected to be restored today. (Reuters report, 6th)</p>
<p>London: British Foreign Secretary Halifax declared in the House of Lords yesterday that there have been notable developments outside of Europe. The British government has received reports that a Japanese military mission has made certain demands on Vietnam. He immediately instructed the British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, to bring these reports to the attention of the Japanese government and to reiterate the British government's concern about maintaining the status quo in Vietnam. At the same time, U.S. Secretary of State Hull also issued a statement saying that the U.S. government attaches importance to the Vietnam situation. (Reuters report, 6th)</p>
<p>Berlin: According to the most well-informed German sources here yesterday, Japan has been making regular and detailed reports to Germany on all its actions and intentions in Annam (Vietnam), so Germany is fully aware of all secrets in the Far East. However, German officials, on the other hand, are refusing to criticize Japan's demands on Annam because the current situation has not yet been determined. Well-informed sources believe that the close and friendly relationship between Japan and Germany is sufficient to ensure that the Annam problem can be resolved. They firmly believe that the rights Japan seeks in Annam are purely economic in nature, and also, due to the needs of the war against China, it hopes to obtain practical military benefits, without any territorial ambitions. All parties here believe that the gradual development of relations between Japan and Annam will ultimately be the same as Germany's relations with the Balkan countries. Germany now regards a part of the Balkans as its main sphere of economic interest. (United Press report, 6th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Well-informed sources recently told a United Press reporter that there is now a large Japanese fifth column working in Vietnam, numbering over 3,000, all of whom are armed and their numbers are increasing rapidly. They also said that intelligence personnel composed of Japanese and Vietnamese who support Japan all carry pistols.</p>
<p>Hanoi: When the Japanese delegation held negotiations with the authorities of the French protectorate of Vietnam on the second of this month, certain urgent demands were made, causing the situation to suddenly become tense. However, Japanese Supervisory Chief Major General Nishihara did not insist on these demands, and therefore the two sides resumed talks. The main goal is to discuss the implementation methods of the diplomatic agreement recently concluded between the French and Japanese governments in Tokyo. Vietnamese Governor-General Lieutenant General Decoux has maintained contact with the French government, so all negotiation processes have been reported to the central government. As for the current situation, it is natural for the Vietnamese authorities to take various military precautions. As of now, the residents of Vietnam, including French expatriates and natives, are all unusually calm. (Havas News Agency report, 6th)</p>
<h3 id="e2">Hull's Original Statement on the Vietnam Situation <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Washington: U.S. Secretary of State Hull stated yesterday that Britain is extremely concerned about Japan's actions in Vietnam, and he recalled Japan's recent statements in favor of maintaining the status quo in the Pacific to express his intention. Hull said that he had heard press reports that "Japanese military authorities have delivered an ultimatum to the French authorities in Vietnam, demanding to pass troops through Vietnam and to use Vietnamese bases to fight against China. We recall that in recent months, the U.S. government, several other national governments, and even the Japanese government have expressed their willingness to respect and maintain the status quo in the Pacific, and specifically mentioned maintaining the status quo of the Dutch East Indies and French Indochina. Since news of Japan's delivery of an ultimatum to the Vietnamese authorities lacks official confirmation, the U.S. government is not in a position to believe it to be true. However, the situation and issues involved in this news are considered by the U.S. government to be extremely important events. If the news proves to be well-founded, the impact on American public opinion will be unimaginable." In answering an inquiry, Hull also said that to his knowledge, the situation in Vietnam has nothing to do with the return to Shanghai this week of U.S. Rear Admiral Hart, commander of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet. (United Press report, 6th)</p>
<p>Washington: Reliable sources recently told the United Press that British diplomats had discussed the Far East situation and the Dutch East Indies oil issue with U.S. Secretary of State Hull. The British diplomats who met with Hull were British Ambassador to the U.S. Lord Lothian, Australia's first Minister to the U.S. Casey, and British Imperial Oil Production Supervisor Agnew. Agnew's participation in the discussion is generally considered to be very important. (United Press report, 6th)</p>
<h3 id="e3">Disagreement Between Japanese Army and Navy <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing: The authorities here are not surprised by Japan's withdrawal of the ultimatum to Vietnam, believing that Japan never intended to use force in Vietnam. This ultimatum was just a kind of intimidation, hoping to make the other party concede without war. The Chinese opinion here is that since this intimidation was exposed, Japan decided to abandon its invasion plan. The recent news of the resignation of the Japanese Navy Minister is generally considered to be the first indication of a divergence of opinion at the highest command level in Japan. According to information received by Chinese people here, the Japanese Navy strongly opposed the Army's proposed plan to seize Vietnam. People here believe that the Japanese Navy Minister's announcement of his resignation due to illness on the eve of the Japanese military's proposed landing implies the Navy's determination to oppose this policy. Well-informed sources believe that although the Japanese Navy Minister has resigned, the Navy's attitude will remain unchanged, because the Japanese Navy has always opposed policies that seem likely to offend Britain and the United States. Chinese military sources believe that the Japanese do not urgently want to occupy Vietnam, especially during this season of frequent heavy rains. Even if Japan attempts to invade, it will probably do so in early November when the weather is more conducive to large-scale operations. If the Japanese were to advance westward from Longzhou along the Vietnamese border to spy on Kunming, it would be more convenient than taking the route through Vietnam. A Chinese military spokesperson recently issued a statement, saying that the Japanese are now concentrating a fifth division in the Longzhou area, moving towards Zhennanguan. It is reported that French railway traffic continues to run across the border as usual. Observers here are speculating about the impact of Japan's withdrawal of the ultimatum. Some believe that this move may make Britain's attitude towards the Burma Road issue tougher. After the French exposed Japan's "intimidation," Britain and the United States expect Japan not to resort to force rashly, so their attitude towards Japan may become tougher. Others believe that Japan may take new and unexpected actions elsewhere to offset the domestic and international impact of the Vietnam situation. According to sources here, there is still no news of Germany and Italy participating in the French-Japanese talks. (Reuters report, 6th)</p>

<h3 id="e4">The Seriousness of the Housing Problem in Shanghai <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>The internal unrest in Shanghai society initially only affected the laboring classes at the lower and middle levels. Recently, the impact of severe living conditions has also shaken the lives of the general middle and upper-class wage earners. The reason for this is that the high price of food is a fatal blow to the lives of the masses. If you ask what people eat, fish, meat, chicken, and duck are indispensable; vegetables and fruits are also essential. However, even with these vegetables, there is only the hope of quenching thirst with plums. Who is responsible for this? Who caused this? Is it the result of insufficient supply and demand? Or is it the harm of the falling value of the legal tender? These are all superficial views and talk about signs. What is truly important is that if there were no so-called controls, the transportation of goods would certainly not be so difficult and obstructed; if there were no so-called external transport, supply and demand would certainly not be as uneven as it is now; if there were no so-called arbitrary taxes and levies, prices would certainly not be so expensive to this point! However, this is only in terms of a portion of food. Today, there is a problem in living that is no less difficult than this, which is the general housing problem.</p>
<p>Since prices have risen sharply and exorbitant profits have flowed in, it can instantly lead to great wealth. In general, those who own real estate are all eager and ready to raise rents. If they fail to raise rents, they resort to the law. If resorting to the law is ineffective, they say they will renovate, rebuild, or order tenants to move. Or they say that water costs are too high, restricting water supply. Or they say that there is no money for repairs, leaving the house to leak in the rain and be battered by the wind. In short, they create all kinds of inconveniences and difficulties for tenants in order to force them to comply with their attempts to raise rents. If tenants do not comply with their demands, they make it impossible for them to live in peace for even a day, forcing them to seek other places to live. Even landlords who regard contracts as sacred and inviolable when their houses are vacant are now tearing them up. Some raise rents three or four times a year, and some raise them by as much as 70 or 80 percent at a time. There are also those who pretend to sell or change rental agents in order to renegotiate contracts and force rent increases. In fact, the validity of a contract is not affected by changes in property rights and can be ignored. But when the contract expires, they can still make demands as they wish. What is most lamentable is that some entrust the management of real estate to foreign companies, using "foreign" power to deal with tenants. When tenants refuse to raise the rent and argue with the landlords, they even say, "You can go and sue in the Consular Court!" How can they be so unscrupulous? Let us not discuss "boiling beans to burn stalks, beans weeping in the pot." Even if the landlord is a foreign company, and much less a front for a foreign company, they should file a lawsuit in a Chinese court. However, people's hearts are overwhelmed by material desires, disregarding the law and reason, and showing no consideration for human feelings. They only know how to enrich themselves, ignoring others, and do not even consider the consequences of "enriching" themselves, or how it will be beneficial or harmful. They are good at short-term planning but poor at long-term planning, and it is impossible to talk to these Chinese and foreign real estate merchants who value profits over righteousness.</p>
<p>Although landlords can be blamed, there are also tenants who, due to the landlords' insatiable demands, pass them on to their subtenants. Thus, those who become sublandlords invariably take advantage of the landlords' rent increases to greatly increase their subrental prices. Considering the millions of people in the Shanghai concessions, only a small number own their own homes. A larger number rent houses to live in alone, but even that is not as large as the number who rent a single room to live in. Sublandlords are also like landlords. Not all landlords are bad, and there are many who understand the pain of tenants and are unwilling to raise rents. Sublandlords, being tenants themselves, seem to be ignorant of the suffering of borrowing a house to live in. Therefore, many will simply allocate the rent increase imposed by the landlord to the tenants according to the size and location of the subrented rooms, which is certainly a fair way to handle it. But bad sublandlords are different. They actually use the houses they rent as a means of profit. This can be seen in the rental advertisements in the newspapers, where subrentals even require key money. Some also require two or three months' rent as a deposit. A single wing room costs no less than a hundred dollars; a front room or a side room costs no less than forty or fifty dollars to rent. Attics and kitchen sheds are rented for thirty or forty dollars. It has also been heard that someone rented out half of the front of a three-story loft for a monthly rent of twenty dollars and a decoration fee of two hundred dollars. According to those who make a business of renting out houses, someone rented a double house for a monthly rent of over one hundred dollars and then received a monthly rental income of four hundred and eighty dollars after subletting. Although this is said to be done by a very small number of people, given the large profits involved, there should be more and more people who use subletting houses as a business, and they do not hesitate to pay key money, tips, and rent to secure a house for subletting. This has made the amount of rent, key money, and tips larger and larger, making it impossible for honest people to find even a small space to live in. They still have to beg for mercy from sublandlords who are in business for profit. The seriousness of this unfair burden is not difficult to express.</p>
<p>What will be the result of following this path? Since the goal is to make a profit, everything other than "profit" will certainly be ignored. To exhaust the harm: (1) The rights of the contracting tenant are invisibly undermined, resulting in extortion and forced eviction. Living in instability and restlessness, they will inevitably use forcing tenants to leave as a means of repeatedly raising rents, and thus the unrest in society will deepen. (2) As rents rise and prices become more expensive, the landlords (including both landlords and sublandlords) will make unlimited demands, and there will inevitably come a day when some will be unable to pay the rent. (3) As rents become more expensive, the division and subdivision of houses will increase, leading to not just "pigeonholes" within a building, but also to the ancient practice of living in caves and bees living in hives together. (4) As houses are divided into more and more sublets, it becomes easier for fires and epidemics to occur, which will ultimately affect fire protection, security, and public health. (5) Men and women mix, and people of different characters live together. Immoral winds grow, and bad habits become ingrained, which will make social morality decline further and further, threatening to fundamentally destroy the organization of society. This is only speaking of the greatest harms, and the intangible sins are innumerable.</p>
<p>So how can we seek redress? It is not difficult: "The point of governing is not to talk much, but to consider how to act!" Today's governance talks too much, but action does not match words. For example, in controlling the rise in rents, society is not without organization. It exists, but there is much talk and no action! This has led to the current state of affairs. I believe that livelihood issues do not benefit one side, and there are too many legal issues involved. Therefore, the government should issue clear orders, taking into account the interests of both sides, and have the following expedient measures.</p>
<p>(1) All rents (whether whole or sublet) shall be legally fixed at a certain date as the standard, and there shall be no further increases. However, if there is an increase in taxes or if the rent includes water and electricity costs, and the water and electricity costs increase, the amount of the increase shall be fairly distributed among the tenants.</p>
<p>(2) New houses may be priced according to their land value and construction costs, plus reasonable profits and the necessary expenses of the house, as a standard for setting rents. After that, except in the circumstances of the second item of the preceding article, no rent shall be increased.</p>
<p>(3) Tenants who sublet the remaining rooms to others shall, based on the size of the sublet room and the quality of its equipment, plus reasonable expenses from the rent paid, estimate and set the rent that should be earned for that portion of the sublet room. Subtenants shall also be entitled to the protection of rental prices under the provisions of the preceding two articles.</p>
<p>(4) The landlord shall not force the tenant to move for the purpose of increasing the rent or failing to increase the rent, except for arrears in rent.</p>
<p>(5) Once a tenant's right to rent has been contractually established, if there is no breach of contract, he shall still have the right to continue renting under the original contract upon expiration of the contract.</p>
<p>(6) If the landlord forces a rent increase or oppresses the tenant in any way, the tenant may apply to the local police or court to stop it.</p>
<p>(7) If the landlord and tenant have to increase or decrease the original rent for unavoidable reasons, they shall petition the court to decide. Before a decision is made, the original lease shall be performed, and neither party shall take any action to damage the other party's interests.</p>
<p>The above is presented as a measure suitable for the times and adapted to circumstances. If the authorities truly know to place importance on people's livelihoods and security, then for food and housing issues, they should carefully redress the situation and make it a reality, so that the whole society is not uneasy for a long time and that empty words are not used to gloss over the past.</p>

<p>Washington: New York Mayor La Guardia, a member of the U.S.-Canada Joint Defense Committee, hinted yesterday that cooperation between the U.S. and Canada could allow large quantities of U.S. military supplies to be shipped to the Canadian border. After dining with President Roosevelt, La Guardia announced that the United States will build two naval and air bases in Newfoundland. Also, U.S. Army Chief of Staff Marshall said that the U.S. Army is considering transferring tanks to Canada for training. At the same time, eight aging U.S. destroyers have set sail from Boston, presumably heading to Canada.

<p>New York: American newspaper tycoon Hearst wrote an article in his published newspapers on the U.S. government giving fifty destroyers to Britain, saying: "Citizens, we are now at war. This action has been taken, and the die is cast. Roosevelt has finally moved forward. What he wants is to involve us in the war through the election. He has obviously realized this. Now only short-sighted people do not want to fight. They harbor narrow-minded prejudices because they have to join the army. The only question now is what kind of retaliatory plan will those whom we regard as enemies take. It is expected that the first action of the Axis powers will probably be to conclude a defensive alliance with Japan." Other newspapers mostly agree with this action. Some see it as greatly beneficial to U.S. self-defense, some see it as mutually beneficial to Britain and the United States, some praise Roosevelt's courage, and some say that this action should have been taken earlier. Some say that the Axis powers thought that the United States would not dare to take courageous action during the presidential election, and today's action will surprise the Axis powers. The Washington Post said, "We can now easily obtain benefits by dividing, and huge changes require courageous action to deal with them. The English democratic countries have shown in the current changes that they have the necessary perseverance, vision, determination to quickly take courageous action." (Reuters report, 6th)</p>

<p>Guilin – The Provincial Relief Association has established a land reclamation plan, attracting investment from Hong Kong compatriots. Nine areas of wasteland in the Liujiang River basin have been selected as reclamation sites. It is expected that twelve land reclamation companies can be established. Hong Kong compatriots with wealth and the ambition to engage in land reclamation can pool funds to organize land reclamation companies to operate them. It is stipulated that each land reclamation company operate one reclamation area, with an area of 10,000 to 20,000 mu as the standard, and must raise funds of 200,000 to 500,000 yuan. If the operation is expanded and the funds are insufficient, loans may be obtained from financial institutions. (Sixth Dispatch)</p>

<p>Hong Kong – A Japanese plane that crashed in Fangling (transliteration) yesterday afternoon has now been identified as a civilian aircraft of Japan Airlines, flying from Taipei to Guangzhou. According to Japanese sources, the plane encountered thick clouds after leaving Taiwan, and the pilot had to fly blind for most of the journey. When approaching the Hong Kong border, the engine suddenly stopped. The pilot then instructed to find a suitable landing place, and saw the Kwangti (transliteration) Racecourse to land the plane, but accidentally hit the trees on the edge of the field and was destroyed.

<p>Chongqing – In the past, the Central Farmer's Bank adopted two methods for lending to farmers: cooperative credit lending and farmers' movable property mortgage. Since implementation, these methods have been quite effective. The bank has now carefully researched and formulated the "Regulations on Movable Property Indirect Possession Pledge Lending for Farmers" based on past experience. The main purpose is to enable farmers to obtain credit through movable property pledges, while still being able to continue to possess the movable property. This eliminates the trouble of organizing cooperatives and does not hinder production and operation. After the implementation of this method, even immature seedlings and livestock being raised can be used as collateral to obtain funds, which invisibly accelerates the reproduction of agricultural funds, making it an ideal agricultural loan method.

<p>London – Today, Nazi planes bombed thirty-two districts in the London area and carried out massacres and destruction in towns and villages throughout Britain. As a result, twenty-eight German planes were shot down. Since last night, German planes have been attacking London almost continuously. Throughout the night and into this morning, German planes continued to bomb fiercely. Within a radius of fifteen miles from the center of London, German planes dropped more than fifty high-explosive bombs and more than one hundred incendiary bombs. This morning, fires broke out in three or four residential and commercial areas. The largest fire was at the Woolworths store, the second large store to be destroyed in ten days. However, the fires in other places were quickly extinguished. This morning, at least ten people were killed and hundreds injured in the London area. Two emergency alerts were issued in London, the first at 9:58 and the second at 12:55 this afternoon. Last night, hundreds of people narrowly escaped disaster when a huge public air-raid shelter was hit by a bomb. Fortunately, only a few people had taken refuge in it at the time, so there were only a few casualties. (Sixth United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>London – Yesterday, German bombers continued to launch large-scale attacks on British cities, and a night attack on the London area. Officials announced that at least 34 German planes had been shot down, and the British side lost a total of 12 fighter planes, but the pilots of three of them landed safely. After 11:00 pm yesterday, a large number of German bombers flew across the east coast into the mainland, and the London area suffered an extremely barbaric attack. It is estimated that the number of enemy planes flying over the London area since the start of the war was the highest last night. It is reported that many incendiary bombs and whistling bombs have been dropped on London. After a German plane dropped flares, there was a loud noise, shaking houses. Until late last night, it was reported that German bombers had appeared in more than eight towns and cities outside the London area. According to an announcement by the Air Ministry, transportation in the southern part of London was slightly disrupted after being attacked yesterday morning, and damage elsewhere was minor. A few bombs also fell in the Welsh area yesterday, damaging a small chapel, but there were no reports of casualties. Yesterday afternoon, British fighter planes fought bravely and repelled German planes attempting to attack British airfields. An Air Ministry communiqué reviewing yesterday's battle situation stated that the enemy air force launched another attack yesterday afternoon. A large number of enemy planes crossed the Kent coast and divided into two groups, aided by a small number of enemy planes that flew across the coast later, attempting to attack airfields on both sides of the Thames River, but were all met and driven back by British fighter planes. A factory on one side of the Thames River was hit and slightly damaged, but the German planes did not succeed in attacking other places. There have been no reports of casualties so far.

<p>London – It was revealed today that on the night of the 4th of this month, British bombers penetrated deep into eastern Germany, flying to Politz, a few miles north of Stettin on the Baltic coast, and bombed the artificial oil plant there. This was one of the British Air Force's farthest bombing raids into Germany, covering a total of 1,200 miles, mostly flying in enemy territory. Before the British planes took off, the pilots were excited to hear that they would be flying even farther than Berlin. One said, "After this flight, flying to the Ruhr will be child's play." It is reported that the raid was extremely successful. One pilot dived low to bomb, and saw the bomb land in the center of the oil plant. Soon after, the tall chimneys all collapsed and a fire broke out. The flames could still be seen 70 miles away. The remaining British planes continued to drop bombs, hitting a factory, with fires burning in fifteen places. According to reports from British planes attacking the Sulengqi Ya forest, the forest was bombed and caught fire, burning for 80 miles.

<p>London – British Foreign Secretary Halifax reported on the situation in Romania in the House of Lords yesterday, saying that the recent actions of the Romanian government have directly harmed the interests of British shipping and oil industries. The British government has notified the Romanian government that if British interests are still treated in this way, there is no possibility of developing British-Romanian trade, and that the British government may detain Romanian ships in retaliation. Romania quickly fell into the embrace of Germany and abandoned British guarantees. There is no doubt now that Romania recognizes the value of the guarantees given by the Axis powers. The Foreign Secretary then spoke of Greece, saying that what Italy has accused Greece of is completely untrue. The Greek government and people have remained calm and unshaken in the face of Italian newspapers' intimidation and provocation, and are still committed to maintaining their neutrality, but have also decided to defend their integrity and independence to resist foreign aggression. If there is any action that clearly undermines the independence of Greece, the British government feels obliged to provide Greece with all kinds of assistance within its power.

The event occurred because supporters of the King demonstrated against the new Prime Minister Antonescu yesterday.

He said that the impulsive patriots were supporters of the King.

<h3 id="e31">Churchill Reports on the War Situation: Britain's Position is Better Than Before; Naval and Air Force Equipment is Sufficient to Resist Strong Attacks; Strong Forces Have Been Sent to Reinforce the Middle East <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>London - Prime Minister Churchill briefly described the war situation in the House of Commons yesterday, saying that Britain's position today is indeed better than it was a few months ago. This is due to the active preparations in the country and the dispatch of fresh troops to support the eastern Mediterranean. However, the people should not think that the danger of Britain being invaded has passed. The Prime Minister expressed satisfaction with the Anglo-American naval agreement, saying that the American sky and sea borders have extended deep into the Atlantic over a vast area, and the fifty American destroyers handed over to Britain can be said to make up for the deficiencies in the service of warships built during Britain's wartime program. The Prime Minister spoke of the British air war, saying that the German air force had suffered heavy damage. In terms of the number of aircraft, the losses were three to one, and in terms of personnel, the losses were six to one. The number of British air force is now greater than in July, and the equipment is also more complete. He is confident that it can resist stronger attacks from the German side, but the people must not say that the danger of invasion has now passed. The Secretary of War advised the people to be prepared for everything, which is appropriate. Some people say that after September 15, the last date for the invasion of Britain mentioned by Hitler, Britain can avoid the danger of overseas attacks. I don't think so. Although winter winds and rains often occur, fog is thick, and the weather is dark, it may change the situation, but we must not relax in the slightest. I said that our situation is better now than in July. I am not revealing any military secrets, but if the British problem felt difficult in June, it will feel even more difficult in September. National defense arrangements have moved forward on a large scale. We have been able to send reinforcements to the Middle East one after another. A few days ago, we sent several of our strongest and newest warships to the eastern Mediterranean, almost doubling the strength of the fleet there. Although this action was known to the Italian side, it was not disturbed by the Italian side. Some British ships will go to Malta and carry some of the materials needed to defend Malta. We anticipate a fierce battle in the Middle East soon. We are determined to maintain our position in the Middle East with the greatest strength and increase our naval power. This is true in the eastern Mediterranean, and it is also true in the western Mediterranean. The Prime Minister spoke of the German air raids, saying that the method of air raid alarms must be greatly changed. If the alarm is sounded two or three times a day in a large area simply because enemy planes are traveling to unpredictable targets, it is useless and not beneficial. Therefore, I plan to ask the relevant administrative departments to review this matter again. The street lamp problem is being studied, and the responsible departments are discussing how to make the streets brighter and make pedestrians happier during the winter months. Finally, the Prime Minister said that no matter what changes occur, we will move forward along this path at home and abroad. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<p>Satisfied with US-British Cooperation</p>
<p>London - Amid cheers in the House of Commons yesterday, Prime Minister Churchill reported on the eternally memorable exchange between Britain and the United States, saying that as far as I know, the completion of this matter has made the people of Britain and the United States very satisfied, and the friends of our world will also be excited about it. The value of this matter can be clearly seen in the official documents. It would be a mistake to seek other meanings outside of this. This exchange is purely a plan for mutual assistance between two friendly countries in the spirit of trust, sympathy, and goodwill. Only the ignorant would make the statement that the transfer of American ships to Britain is an act that violates international law. Hitler certainly does not like this matter. I know that if Hitler had the opportunity, he would retaliate against the United States. The British Admiralty is pleased to have these fifty destroyers. We will put the American destroyers into active service as soon as possible. British sailors are waiting at the port of delivery to take over.</p>
<p>Involving the Balkan Situation</p>
<p>The Prime Minister spoke of Romania, saying that in my personal opinion, southern Dobruja should be returned to Bulgaria, and the treatment Hungary received in the last war also made me unhappy. However, we do not want to recognize any land changes that occur during wartime unless they have obtained the free permission and goodwill of the parties concerned. No one can predict where Hitler's empire will expand to when the current war is not over, but I believe that this kind of empire will soon be destroyed quickly.</p>
<p>Britain Can Cope with the Air War</p>
<p>The Prime Minister spoke of the general air war, saying that the air war was very active in July, but August was the real month of battle. However, neither side exerted its full strength. The German side made a great effort to gain air superiority, using more planes than we used to fight back. The attempt to break through the British air defenses has proven to be very costly. The loss of three planes for one and six pilots for one does not include all the losses suffered by the German side. We must prepare for an even more intense war this month. The enemy has a great need for a quick victory. If Hitler really has the number of planes that we previously estimated, he should be able to strengthen his attack in September. However, the British Air Force officials are confident that we have the ability to cope with a large-scale air war. The German side claimed that 1,921 British planes were destroyed in July and August, but in fact, only 558 British planes were lost in these two months. The loss of British aviators is of course even less than this. I don't know if Hitler believes in the accuracy of his own figures. The world would like to see the enemy fall into the error of self-deception.</p>

<p>Bucharest - The King of Romania, Michael, who ascended the throne today, is only nineteen years old and has already ascended the throne twice. Michael was born on October 25, 1921. In 1927, after the death of his grandfather Ferdinand, Michael ascended the throne, and power was exercised by several regents. In 1930, his father Carol returned to the country, and Michael abdicated. Carol ascended the throne on June 8 of that year. Michael received excellent training in his childhood. He grew up at the age of fifteen, and his physique was larger than his father's. Moreover, because of his participation in the Romanian youth organization, he had a lot of contact with Romanian youth and was loved by the people. Michael not only has excellent military training, but also has devoted himself to the study of politics and science. He can speak four languages: German, Italian, English, and French, and he speaks fluently, which is enough to show that he is extraordinarily intelligent. (Haitong News Agency, 6th)</p>
<p>Bucharest - King Carol I of Romania was born in 1893. He studied at the University of Bucharest and the Joses Officer School. When Romania participated in the First European War and fought alongside the Allied Powers, Carol served as the commander of a legion. After the European War, he traveled around the world. In 1921, he married Princess Helen of Greece. Because the Liberal Party had disagreements with him, he traveled abroad for five years before returning to the country. Carol ascended the throne on June 8, 1930, and abdicated to Crown Prince Michael after ten years on the throne. (Haitong News Agency, 6th)</p>

<p>In modern total warfare, the resistance and endurance of the entire nation of the belligerent countries have a great impact on the key to victory or defeat. This travelogue was written by an American, Amos Burg, and published in the August issue of the American Geographic Magazine this year. On the eve of the war, he sailed a small boat from London, went north along the Grand Canal to Liverpool, and his experiences along the way can be said to have been deeply rooted in British civil life. What he saw and heard cannot be compared with those who "took a quick look at the flowers" by plane or train. The translation is as follows:</p>
<p>Last summer, I and my friend sailed a Canadian-style canoe, the "Song of the Wind," from London, following the most fearful canal in England, through Birmingham to Liverpool, for a total of four weeks. This trip was like touring the rear of England, gaining a glimpse of the British national character from the side, and discovering the tenacious life of the residents along the canal, which cannot be seen by those who take a quick look at the flowers.</p>
<p>One morning, I stood by the dock lock in London, waiting for the Grand Canal Company to issue a "key" for passage. My friend drove the "Song of the Wind" and rowed to the commercial road lock to wait for me. The lock was the first lock on our way north.</p>
<p>The so-called "key" is actually a curved iron handle tied with a pink ribbon, which is used to open unattended locks. A technician from the Grand Canal Company solemnly handed this handle to me and said that I must pass through the Limehouse district before dusk to avoid the disturbance of children throwing stones. After speaking, he bowed and retreated.</p>
<p>Although the European War had not yet broken out at that time, a great disaster was imminent. The Grand Canal runs through the industrial area of central England, and motorboats tow barges carrying raw materials back and forth to help Britain reorganize its military preparations.</p>
<p>The British canal was dug 150 years ago, during the early rise of the steel and textile industries, to transport bulky goods such as coal and machinery, and to promote the industrial revolution. Then, with the advent of the railway, the canal lost its effectiveness and disappeared into obscurity for a hundred years. The goods transported by the canal during this period were as rare as morning stars.</p>
<p>Until the end of the nineteenth century, road and railway freight were overcrowded, so a part was diverted to the canal for transportation, and the Grand Canal shipping industry began to recover. In 1929, eleven old canals were connected to form a large canal, and a company was established to be responsible for dredging and repairing, and transforming new-style locks. The investment was huge, and the complex old canal was further improved. Later, stimulated by the reorganization of military preparations, shipping became more developed.</p>
<p>I applied to the Grand Canal Company for a pass to sail from London to Birmingham, which took a week to obtain, because barges traveled back and forth in the canal in an endless stream, and the boat would inevitably hinder traffic. But I brought the boat from Olai, USA, 6,000 miles to England, specifically for a tour, and finally obtained permission.</p>
<p>Americans are usually impatient and fully intend to launch the boat into the water and set off immediately. Unexpectedly, in the narrow river channel in the dock, there were many barges tied under the electric crane to load and unload scrap iron, copper, and steel for various factories in central England. There were also various ships that were blocking the way horizontally and vertically, and we could not pass through the dock to reach the entrance of the canal. In the end, we waited quietly until the next day before the start of freight traffic to set off early.</p>
<p>The next morning, we arrived at the dock, where there were few people. However, after the boat was launched, freight traffic was already active. We quickly rowed straight to the commercial road gate, obtained the gate opening handle from the Grand Canal Company, and drove through the London industrial area in one breath.</p>
<p>In the London district, barges in the canal are towed by horses, slowly moving forward at two miles per hour, and only ten miles a day. Once out of the London district, horses are rarely seen, and barges are towed by motor "fast boats" or "flying boats." It takes about 60 hours to reach Birmingham, which used to take a week without motorboats. These boats are painted with colorful patterns, 72 feet long and only 7 feet wide, so that they can pass through the narrowest locks.</p>
<p>The boatmen live on the water, and the old and young all live in small cabins painted with colorful paints at the stern. Young children also assist in boat operations. The long rudder of the barge is managed by the whole family in turn, and even the little daughter can do it, but the boatman himself is always busy operating the motorboat.</p>
<p>There are about 5,000 inland boatmen living on the British canals. A small number of boatmen in remote areas are no different from "water nomads"; however, the boatmen on the Grand Canal work hard all year round and have a lot of savings, so they cannot be called nomads.</p>
<p>The boatmen are not easily willing to talk to passing strangers. I stopped a barge and moored next to it to have a meal on the boat. I only saw the boatman's whole family working tirelessly. The boat woman was wiping the deck in the cabin, and the children were wiping copperware, ignoring me, as if the work was important and they had no time to care about other things.</p>
<p>After a while, the boatman went out and painted colorful fortresses or roses on the hull. Finally, he noticed me next to his boat and said, "Your boat needs to be painted with colorful colors, just like adding a new dress to your wife."</p>
<p>The boat woman interjected, "Painting the boat with colorful colors should be more diligent than adding a new dress, otherwise, the wind and rain will erode it, and it will be mottled like the lock gate."</p>
<p>I asked what the significance of painting the hull with colorful colors was. He replied, "There is no reason, but all barges are painted with fortresses and roses."</p>
<p>I suddenly remembered that the boatmen had a superstition that all barges must be painted with a fortress, otherwise they would sink.</p>
<p>The boatman also said that he has two children, and whenever the boat is moored, they take the opportunity to go to school for a few hours. Now they are waiting for the two children to finish their classes and return to the boat, and then they will set off for Birmingham. He was quite proud of this. It can be said that the children of British boatmen all study in various places whenever they have time on their journeys, which can be said to be a unique form of education.</p>
<p>In recent years, with the development of movies and radio, the isolation of canal boatmen from the outside world has been reduced a lot. At that time, the radio in the cabin of the barge was playing music. The boatman said, "We have listened to the radio broadcast of the coronation ceremony of the King of England."</p>
<p>The boat woman brought out fragrant tea to entertain the guests and gesticulated to describe the plot of the film "Mutiny on the Bounty" that she had watched the night before.</p>
<p>Before long, the boatman's children returned to the boat, so they untied the rope and left the shore, heading towards the pitch-black Islington Tunnel. I also rowed alongside them.</p>
<p>The Islington Tunnel passes through the densely populated industrial area of London, is one foot high, and is more than half a mile long. It was built in 1810. However, many of the residents above the tunnel do not know that there is such a tunnel underground. I waited for a tugboat to tow six barges and slowly drove out, and then I rowed into the tunnel, speeding towards a faint light at the other end.</p>
<p>When we reached Regent's Park, we were refreshed by the lush green scenery. From the start of the voyage to here, we had passed nearly a hundred factories and shipyards, with coal ash flying and noisy sounds. Regent's Park is different. Two or three tourists are either walking slowly under the green shade or taking off their shoes and lying on the grass, enjoying themselves leisurely. On holidays, there are many tourists, which shows how much the British love the fields and flowers. From the Cape in the south of England to the misty Orkney Islands in the north, the entire territory is like a large garden, and no effort is spared to preserve it. This is due to this love.</p>
<p>We arrived at Paddington Pond at sunset, eight miles from the starting point, but we were still not out of London, and we were still not out of the stone throwing area. After a while, children by the river threw stones at us. I complained to a police officer. Unexpectedly, the police officer was tolerant and replied, "These children have just left school and need to do some activities." I had no choice but to avoid the small hill in the pond. I drove away the ducks and climbed the hill to set up camp among a cluster of willow trees. Opposite was a row of old-fashioned factories and warehouses. It was amazing to be able to camp in the London area.</p>
<p>A British friend received my telegram and came with his wife to go boating. He casually joked with the children on the riverbank, and the children immediately responded with bricks and mud, throwing them at our faces like raindrops. I was forced to return to the small hill and sit down in the tent. Bricks were still falling around, and finally the tent was knocked down.</p>
<p>The next morning, we untied the rope and set off. In the western United States, the rivers are turbulent and the boats travel like arrows. The British Grand Canal has no tides at all, but the headwind is quite strong, and there is a tendency to blow the boat backwards. I imitated the method of horse-towing barges, and everyone took turns going ashore to tow the boat, and one person sat in the boat to steer.</p>
<p>After arriving at Cawley Lock, we left London and entered the green countryside. Looking around, the scenery was quiet. Farms were everywhere, and thatched cottages were scattered. The gardens were neat and tidy. I realized why British expats miss their hometowns so much.</p>
<p>The beauty of England is most easily seen in the small details. The houses in various places were built in different eras, some made of huge stones, some half-timbered, some covered with thatch, all of which were beautiful and moving, and in harmony with the surrounding scenery. England's foreign trade is the best in the world, and its population density is rare. Its countryside is so vast and spacious, which is almost disproportionate.</p>
<p>When the canal was first dug 150 years ago, the British regarded it as an "ugly ditch." So they planted grass and trees and built stone walls on the riverbank to hide this "trace" of copper stench. That's why I always sail between two rows of trees, a green shade, without seeing the villages on both sides of the farm for several miles. I can only climb the riverbank to get a glimpse of the scenery. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e37">Student Academic Performance Assessment Methods for Colleges and Universities - Strictly Implemented Starting This Semester <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education recently announced that although the level of students in colleges and universities has slightly improved compared with the past, the development of the quality of colleges and universities has not fully corresponded to the development of quantity. In order to improve the level of students in colleges and universities and seek the improvement of the quality of higher education, the main points of the student academic performance assessment methods for colleges and universities are specially formulated as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Temporary tests must be held at least once in each semester. The test papers should be properly preserved by the school. Within one year, the Ministry may order them to be called up for review at any time, or inspect them according to the curriculum when sending personnel for inspection.</p>
<p>(2) Students' usual lecture notes, reading notes, and reports on practice, internship, and experiments should be combined and calculated separately from the temporary tests as usual grades. The method of calling up for review is the same as in the previous article.</p>
<p>(3) Semester tests should be strictly implemented at the end of each semester and should not be held early. The results of the semester tests must be combined and calculated with the usual grades as the semester grades.</p>
<p>The results of the aforementioned semester tests must be made into a list and submitted to the Ministry for verification at the end of the semester. The Ministry may also randomly review the test papers of a certain subject at any time.</p>
<p>(4) Students who fail the semester test with a score of 40 or more but less than 60 may be given a supplementary test, but only once. Those who fail with a score of less than 40 are not allowed to take a supplementary test and should be ordered to retake the course. If the number of credits for failed subjects exceeds one-third of the total number of credits taken in that semester, the student should be ordered to repeat the grade. If it exceeds one-half, the student should be ordered to withdraw from school.</p>
<p>(5) The graduation test is changed to a comprehensive examination system. In addition to the final semester subjects, at least two (three for vocational schools and special courses) must contain the courses of the entire academic year, and the three or more major subjects previously studied in each grade must be passed. Those who fail are not allowed to graduate.</p>
<p>The aforementioned graduation test subjects must be reported to the Ministry for approval when reporting the graduating students.</p>
<p>(6) The graduation test committee and student graduation thesis (graduation thesis is not required for vocational schools and special courses) must be strictly implemented in accordance with the regulations of the university regulations and the revised vocational school regulations.</p>
<p>Starting from this semester, each school should strictly implement the above regulations and methods.</p>
<h3 id="e38">This City: Overview of the Implementation of Public Education <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>Progress in Both Quality and Quantity, Enthusiastic Support from Various Schools</p>
<p>(Dahua News Agency) The implementation of compulsory education in this city began in the 24th year of the Republic [1935], but was once suspended due to the impact of the war following the July 7th Incident [Marco Polo Bridge Incident, 1937]. It was resumed from the first semester of the 26th year [1937], and has seen remarkable development in the past year. According to a spokesperson for the Compulsory Education Promotion Association of this city:</p>
<p>Adapting to Needs, Progressing Step by Step</p>
<p>Since the War of Resistance, Shanghai's education has relied on the effective guidance of the government authorities, the arduous support of educators, and the demands of the situation. It has not only avoided stagnation but has also made significant progress. Regarding compulsory education, due to the impact of the war, refugee children have gathered in Shanghai, the social economy is declining, and ordinary education expenses are beyond the means of impoverished families. Therefore, the need for compulsory education is more urgent than other forms of education. In order to help these distressed children and provide them with educational opportunities, the educational authorities have strived to restore compulsory education since the 26th year. Despite limited funding, they have steadily pushed forward, and today, a grand spectacle has emerged.</p>
<p>Advancing in Quality and Quantity, Optimistic About the Future</p>
<p>In terms of quantity, there are more than 330 classes in short-term primary schools for children's compulsory education, accommodating over 15,000 children. In terms of adult compulsory education, there are more than 30 public schools, accommodating around 1,300 adults. The number of personnel engaged in compulsory education work has reached nearly 400. Compared with the original pre-war undertakings, not only has it not decreased, but it has also increased by more than double. In terms of quality, concrete measures have been established for all aspects of administration, teaching, and guidance, and are implemented uniformly throughout the city. From this semester onwards, there are detailed plans for the standardization of curricula, the supply of teaching materials, the improvement of administrative management, and the promotion of inspections and guidance, with the aim of achieving the greatest effect with the least amount of funding. Looking ahead, the future is promising.</p>
<p>Acting Selflessly and Righteously, Enthusiastically Supporting</p>
<p>The achievements are due, on the one hand, to the comprehensive planning of the education authorities, and on the other hand, especially to the enthusiastic support of educators, with the latter being particularly significant. Because compulsory education funding is extremely limited, school buildings and equipment must be borrowed from existing schools. Fortunately, the authorities of various schools deeply understand the importance of promoting compulsory education and provide convenience in various ways. On average, each borrowed classroom only pays about six yuan per month for rent, water, and electricity. This spirit of public service and righteousness is not only admired by the association but also worthy of respect from all citizens of the city. Although a small number of schools have been unable to consider the financial difficulties of compulsory education and have not been able to provide convenience, the association is confident that this unfortunate phenomenon will soon disappear.</p>
<p>Life is Difficult, Improving Treatment</p>
<p>The lives of compulsory education personnel are extremely difficult. Their monthly income is often insufficient to maintain their own livelihood, let alone provide for their families. In this time of high prices, it is even more impossible to make ends meet. Fortunately, from this semester onwards, the funding per class has been slightly increased. The principal's salary is set at 28 yuan, and the teacher's salary is set at 24 yuan, with miscellaneous income (set at 40 cents per student per semester) allocated to cover office expenses. After this standard is raised, the average salary of teachers and staff can be increased by about 20%. Although it is a drop in the bucket, it is still a small supplement. It is hoped that all compulsory education personnel in the city will share the difficulties of the times, reduce material enjoyment, strive for spiritual comfort, and that the future of education will truly rely on them.</p>

<p>The Zhengfeng College of Arts in this city originally had departments of Chinese Literature and Sinology. Since adding a Department of Commerce last summer and a Vocational Commerce course this summer, it has effectively become a college of both arts and commerce. The name and reality seem to be inconsistent. It is heard that the college submitted a request to the Ministry of Education during the summer vacation. It has now received a reply from Wu Junjun of the Ministry of Education, approving the name change to Chengming College.</p>

<h3 id="e46">Food: Rice Market Speculation Shows Signs of Abating <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>The chaotic rice market showed some signs of clearing up yesterday, as the ban on shipping from Hong Kong and Vietnam was lifted, and large quantities of foreign rice arrived one after another. Shop sales were already above the price limit, and retail sales were difficult to promote, so there were few inquiries. Holders' thoughts became more relaxed as a result. Except for high-end foreign rice, there were calls for 66 to 67 yuan in the underground market, but there were no samples on offer. Other mid-range goods were mostly offered at the assessed price, but those manipulating the market were still unwilling to give up, and large households were still hoping for high prices to come. Therefore, the future market is prone to change with the slightest disturbance. Yesterday, as the exchange rate returned to Chang [Changjiang, Yangtze River], people's minds changed again, and some profitable bulls took the opportunity to exit. The market suddenly saw a strong selling trend, and the price fell lower and lower, suddenly dropping three or four yuan. After the price decreased slightly, there were inquiries taking advantage of the low price, and the market rebounded by about one yuan again. As a result, it was slightly lower than the previous day by two or three yuan, but still one or two yuan different from the publicly limited price. The only rice officially announced on the market was Zhongguan rice. Reclaimed original packaging of No. 2 Saigon rice, which was previously offered at 75 to 76 yuan, also fell to 73 to 74 yuan yesterday, and some medium-quality goods were officially sold at 71 yuan.</p>
<p>As for glutinous rice and japonica rice, the stock of broken millstones in the interior is dwindling. Yesterday, only 700 to 800 *dan* arrived. Although the reported dark market trading turned lackluster, the owners insisted, and the price remained at the original level, without any ups or downs. The prices quoted were all the same as before.</p>
<p>Still only 32 *dan* of Zhoupu goods arrived, and the selling price did not change, opening at 69.5 yuan to 69 yuan. Because porters heard of the soaring prices in Shanghai, they rushed to the market. The supply of new Taicang Yangjian rice brought by bicycle suddenly surged, to no less than 30 *shi*. However, the sales market suddenly turned dull due to the recovery of foreign rice. The porters, seeing that the new goods were soft and not easy to hold, had to loosen their grip, so the price depreciated by nearly one yuan. The original package opened at 63 to 64 yuan, and the price in *hu* was around 61 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e47">Bulls Take Profits and Exit, Japanese Flour Falls Slightly <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>Flour: Yesterday, the futures trading of Japanese factory flour, Phoenix brand, was still active, but the market had turned weak, and some bulls also exited. However, some customers still took advantage of the low prices to buy in, and the market did not fall much. The quoted price for Phoenix spot goods was 14.6 yuan, September 15 yuan to 14.9 yuan, and October 15.35 yuan. More than 5,000 bags were traded, all down one jiao to one jiao and a half from the previous day. Trading in inland flour and foreign flour was quiet. After the output of local factory flour decreased, the domestic sales demand was not weak, so the market was tight, with reclaimed goods being higher than the factory price by two or three jiao, which was different from the trend of Japanese factory flour.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday's trading became quiet again, because very little goods arrived in the past few days, and even fewer were transported into the concession. After the export group once bought, they were still greedy for more, but unfortunately there were no goods to buy. The same was true for Chinese factories. However, Japanese factories still bought 3,000 to 4,000 bags of wheat from cars and ships at a price of 22 yuan to 21.5 yuan. It was also heard that the street Yuanfang bought 5,000 to 6,000 bags of Su-Xi wheat for 25.5 yuan. The market was once again in a situation where it was difficult to rise or fall.</p>
<h3 id="e48">Oil Market: Road Goods of Raw Oil Arrive, Spot and Futures Oil Fall by One or Two Yuan, Soybean Oil Also Follows Slightly <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the waves in the oil market had subsided, and the overall situation was downstream, because it was reported that more than 10,000 pieces of peanut oil road goods had been transported, which dampened people's spirits, the market atmosphere was loose, and futures oil fell by two yuan, with spot goods following by one yuan. Soybean oil also fell slightly. A total of 20 barrels of Dalian soybean oil were traded at a price of 100 yuan to 99.5 yuan, 30 barrels of Qingdao soybean oil at a price of 97 yuan, and 200 *dan* of Dayou factory soybean oil at a price of 76.5 yuan, and 100 barrels of Pudong factory soybean oil at a price of 76.5 yuan. 50 pieces of Jiaozhou spot peanut oil were traded at a price of 65 yuan, 200 pieces of September futures were traded at a price of 62.5 yuan to 62 yuan, 450 pieces of October futures were traded at a price of 63 yuan to 62.5 yuan, and 450 pieces of October futures were traded at a price of 63.5 yuan to 63 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e49">Finance: Large Selling Wind of Foreign Exchange, Subsides Only in the Afternoon <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation, HSBC's listed prices did not rise or fall, and there was a continuous loose intention in the dark market of British and American exchange rates, because there were no new buyers. In the early morning, speculators dumped US dollars again, reaching 500,000 to 600,000 yuan, so it was almost as long as 5.375 yuan. Unexpectedly, HSBC and an American bank limited the absorption of a huge amount of US dollars at 5.375 yuan this month, and the large selling wind began to subside. The market situation was then cheaper, and finally it was 3 1/2 pence for British gold and 5.34375 yuan for US dollars, calculated as 0.03125 for the central bank and 0.0625 for the American bank. The transaction was prosperous.</p>

HSBC's listed price was announced and did not move, and the balance tax for silver was announced and did not increase or decrease. After that, Chinese merchant speculators turned to buy distant US exchange rates, and the price was still stable, calculated to be 5.3125 yuan for the October US exchange rate to foreign banks, and then 5.34375 and 2.28125 yuan for the current month's US exchange rate, because the intention to buy was strong, and the market turned tight again. Near noon, it hardened slightly, calculated to be 5.3125 yuan for the current month's US exchange rate settled by Chinese merchant speculators. The closing price was 3 484375 pence for British gold and 5.3125 yuan for US exchange rate, which was up 0.015625 for British exchange rate and hardened 0.0625 for US exchange rate compared to the morning opening.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, the market loosened again, and speculators tended to sell. Initially, the American bank absorbed 5.34375 yuan for the September US exchange rate, and later the American bank wanted to sell, but there were no opponents. Only HSBC at 5.375 yuan still had an appetite. The closing price was 3 1/2 pence for British gold and 5.34375 yuan for US exchange rate, and 3 484375 pence for October British gold and 5.3125 yuan for US exchange rate, which was up 0.03125 for the current price of British gold and down 0.0625 for US exchange rate compared to the closing price of the day before yesterday.</p>

<p>Although the dark market of spot gold in this city continued to fall and there were many transactions, because HSBC and American banks limited the absorption of US dollars at 5.375 yuan, the loose trend of foreign exchange had been blocked, and the price retreated to the 6,100 yuan mark, and then rebounded. People's minds in all directions turned uncertain again. About 5,000 taels were traded in total, and the price of jewelry gold fell by another 10 yuan, to 630 yuan, while the prices of customs gold, etc., were flat.</p>
<p>Spot Gold Decreases by 70 Yuan</p>
<p>Since the morning, the price of each bar (10 taels) was initially loose due to the loose exchange rate market, and people's spirits were scattered and weak. There were many sellers when the market opened, and it was pressed down by 85 yuan. The gold shop issued 30 taels to the silver shop, at 6,150 yuan. Then, relying on the gold shop and silver shop to take advantage of the low price, and retail investors also entered at this time, it soon rebounded by 60 yuan, and the silver shop did 50 taels, rising to 6,210 yuan. However, due to the loose foreign exchange market, money changers and a certain silver shop sold fiercely, and it fell sharply to 6,160 yuan. Later, as the foreign exchange market turned slightly, the spot gold shop suddenly came to pull it in, and it rose again to 6,205 yuan. Then, the foreign exchange market loosened again, the selling wind rose again, and the securities group and those who were unable to float sold first, and a certain gold shop still dumped, and the market was quite tired, and the price plummeted to a low of 6,105 yuan.

The afternoon opening was quite good, the gold shop entered 10 taels to the silver shop, at 6,180 yuan, and then rose by more than 10 yuan. The money changer entered 20 taels to the gold shop, at 6,195 yuan. After that, the market suddenly turned down and tired, because the foreign exchange market loosened and the government bonds rose, which led to rumors of peace. The silver shop gang shorted with great force, and soon retreated to a low of 6,135 yuan. The securities gang came out to maintain after entering, and the closing price was still 6,165 yuan. As a result, it decreased by 70 yuan compared to the previous day, and the market situation outside the market was still weak. A small number of transactions were made at 6,150 yuan, with a fluctuation of 105 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of the spot gold shop's own brand of gold was slightly higher than that of spot gold, and the purchase price was reduced by 30 yuan. The spot gold was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there were few transactions.</p>

<p>--Trust Shares Suddenly Rise Again--</p>
<p>Yesterday's stock market, the trend was increasingly tight, and the trading volume gradually decreased. Type B has broken through 58 yuan, Type E has broken through 4 yuan, and Type D has broken through 3 yuan, all seeing new highs again. The market price in the market is already high, and new transactions are gradually decreasing. Filling short positions is only a small number. Most of the entries and exits are exchange transactions. Comparing the market prices, Type A is cheaper, which has attracted many parties to exchange Type C for Type A, Type C for Type E, and some to exchange Type B for Type C, because Type B will be drawn soon, and the rising trend is gradually sufficient. The next lottery will be for Type C, so they are bought in advance. These are all a kind of calculation. There are not many shorts on the table, and the long positions are also limited. Yongkang Hengfu entered Type E and exited Type C, Lianhe entered Type C and exited Type B, and Hongda Jiufeng Tongfeng bought in from beginning to end. Defu Shunchang sold from beginning to end. Tiansheng Type E had some sales. As a result, the market price continued to rise by 0.3 to 0.65 yuan. The total transaction volume was about 1 million yuan. A simple table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock trading, 300 shares of New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory were traded at a price of 22.75 yuan.</p>

Those who usually specialize in waiting for opportunities to buy cheap at the weekend no longer had cheap stocks to buy at this point. Shanghai Silver Company progressed to 28.5 yuan, which was the most noteworthy rising trend of the whole morning. International Trust also soared from 21 yuan to 23 yuan. Wheelock, Yeguang, British Union, etc., were traded frequently. Rubber stocks made slight progress, and cheap stocks were absorbed very quickly.</p>

<p>The yarn market has entered another cycle of rotation, but most people expect the price to rise. All situations are uncertain, but the actual sales market is still seeping secretly as usual. However, it is rumored in the market that the sea defense shipping money can be restored to normal, so buyers are extremely active, but the customer help has no intention to help, and in addition, the exchange rate has returned, and gold has fallen sharply, so the yarn market has suddenly fallen.</p>
<p>Spot yarn opened early in the morning, because the mobs took the lead, and at around 9 o'clock, they advertised that the sea defense could be expected to pass through and load yarn, so they rushed in regardless of everything, and the price of 20-count Double Horse was 1,020 yuan, and suddenly rose to 30 yuan.

Later, due to the partial head cover, the closing price was one pound higher than the previous day. The Indian market was closed, and it is predicted that the price will fall, called Robbie.</p>
<p>In the Shanghai port's foreign cotton trading, Huachang has been buying intensely in recent days, and has purchased tens of thousands of *dan* in the past three days, mostly long-fiber cotton, so the current inventory in the market has been greatly reduced. The thoughts of the industry are also becoming increasingly firm due to the sharp reduction in inventory. It is generally expected that the cotton market will continue to flourish.</p>

<h3 id="e61">Distinguishing Marks on Fractional Currency Notes <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>The Controversy Over Authenticity Concludes</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of counterfeit five-cent notes, after a certain news agency published the points for distinguishing them, which appeared in the local newspapers, this newspaper published the questionable points on the fifth, hoping that "the bank would make a clear statement so that people would know what to do." Yesterday, this newspaper saw a contribution from the Xin Sheng News Agency, stating that the Central Bank had made a clear statement that the counterfeit notes were under investigation. The controversy over authenticity seems to have come to an end.</p>
<p>However, this publication has also received three contributions, which are summarized below for the benefit of those using currency to have a more in-depth understanding.</p>
<p>Wang Lanxiang: Recently, a certain agency identified five-cent banknotes with different English wording as counterfeit. The Central Bank has now stated that they are all genuine banknotes and each has distinguishing marks. In addition to the "中" (zhong) character in the upper left corner, which is well known, there is also a hidden "一一五" (115) character at the roots of the trees on the right side. If you hold the two banknotes up to the light, the patterns match perfectly. The only difference is that the white space around the edges is slightly different in size. There is also the same "中" (zhong) character and "央" (yang) character on one-cent notes, which are often unnoticed. As for counterfeit notes, they have indeed been found on the market. The copper engravings are blurred, the paper is very poor, and there are no distinguishing marks.</p>
<p>Shen Lecai: The following points apply to genuine notes: (1) The English wording at the bottom of the reverse side of the first series is "Union Printing Co. U. S. A." Another banknote has "Union Publishers Printers Fed. Inc U.S.A." (2) The former is slightly darker in color than the latter, especially on the reverse side. (3) The numbers on the reverse side of the first series banknote are bold, and the spacing between the numbers is closer. Another banknote has thinner numbers and slightly wider spacing, with English letters on both ends, while the first series banknote only has English letters before the numbers. The above points are largely the same as the differences between genuine and counterfeit notes in the original text, but the facts are absolutely opposite.</p>
<p>Sun Xuan: The distinguishing marks on the five-cent and one-cent notes are marked, which is the same as what Mr. Wang Lanxiang said, but the positions are clearly pointed out. The "中" (zhong) character distinguishing mark on the five-cent note is on the 伍 (wu) character of the five cents in the lower right corner, under the root of the second tree. The "五" (wu) character is hidden in the upper corner of the 年 (nian) character of the twenty-eighth year, below the sixth tree on the right of the pagoda. The "中" (zhong) character distinguishing mark on the one-cent note is also at the roots of the first two trees on the left, and the "央" (yang) character is to the left of the twenty-eighth year, above the sharp corner of the palindrome, at the roots of the sixth tree on the right of the pagoda.</p>

<h3 id="e62">Protracted Delay in Resolving Defense Zone Issue U.S. Prepares to Take Over Central District Important Decisions Reached in U.S. Authorities' Consultation Admiral Hart to Depart for Tianjin Today After Completing Business <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>According to foreign sources, Admiral Hart, commander of the U.S. Naval Asiatic Fleet, has been holding continuous talks with U.S. Acting Consul General Butler and Colonel Baker, commander of the Fourth Marines, in Shanghai for several days, and important decisions have already been made. Therefore, Hart is scheduled to leave Shanghai today aboard the U.S. cruiser Marblehead and return to Qingdao to be stationed. It is said that the ship came to Shanghai this time to transport supplies, and Hart took the opportunity to come to Shanghai to hear news about the defense zone issue in this area, which is currently being negotiated between the U.S. and Japan. As for Hart's flagship Augusta, it is expected to arrive in Shanghai in mid-September.</p>
<h3 id="e63">U.S. Secretary of State Issues Statement <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>United Press Washington, 5th. U.S. Secretary of State Hull stated yesterday that the A Zone in Shanghai, the location of the U.S. Consulate General and other important American property, is one of the reasons why the U.S. is determined to oppose the Japanese occupation of the British defense zone in Shanghai. The original text of Hull's statement is as follows: "On August 15, at a meeting held in response to a notice from the British side that British troops would withdraw from Shanghai, the Shanghai Defense Force Committee voted to transfer the D Zone of the Public Concession defense zone to the Japanese army and the A Zone to the U.S. defense forces. This decision was made by a majority vote, with the Japanese commander voting against it. This majority vote was later endorsed by the Shanghai Municipal Council. The U.S. government, with the A Zone being the location of the U.S. Consul General and a large number of important American interests, and also because the area is located between the current location of U.S. warships and the usual mooring location of U.S. warships, also approved this vote and notified the Japanese government of its approval. Due to Japan's protests, neither the D Zone nor the A Zone have been taken over by the defense forces. (According to Shanghai newspapers last night, the Japanese seem to have occupied the D Zone without formally notifying U.S. officials and have implemented patrols throughout the area.) The defense of the A Zone is temporarily handled by the Shanghai Volunteer Corps through an agreement. Because this matter is very important, the U.S. and Japanese governments are currently conducting discussions and are focusing on the A Zone. The U.S. government hopes to reach a reasonable solution immediately that takes into account all interests and allows the U.S. defense forces to assume responsibility for the A Zone."</p>
<h3 id="e64">Expression Made by Tokyo <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 6th. Foreign Ministry spokesman Suma said today regarding the Shanghai Public Concession defense zone issue that he believed the U.S. now clearly wants to resolve the issue once and for all. The U.S. government seems very concerned about Shanghai affairs, but we believe this is not very important. The spokesman implicitly indicated that the U.S. is now urging Japan to accept certain conditions not included in the current temporary arrangements. He continued that the Japanese and U.S. authorities in Shanghai are familiar with all aspects of the issue, so it is appropriate to deal with it. We hope they can find a practical solution and reach a resolution. The spokesman did not want to disclose whether the Japanese government had received a note from the U.S. government regarding the issue or whether the two governments had begun negotiations as a result. However, he acknowledged that someone had suggested that such a major event should be handled by the governments in Tokyo or Washington.</p>
<p>Continued Discussion of Defense Zone Issue Yesterday</p>
<p>Yesterday was the 41st anniversary of the signing of the "Open Door" treaty by the great powers and China. Admiral Hart, commander of the U.S. Naval Asiatic Fleet, continued to discuss various issues related to Shanghai with U.S. Acting Consul General Butler in the morning for several hours. No statements were issued regarding the content of the talks, but it is understood that the two discussed nothing more than the current situation, such as the defense zone issue. Well-informed sources in the area stated yesterday that no drastic action would be taken regarding the current situation in Shanghai before the door to negotiations is closed.</p>
<p>U.S. Side Prepares to Take Over A Zone</p>
<p>It is generally speculated that if the defense zone issue cannot be satisfactorily resolved in the near future, then the U.S. Naval Fourth Marine Regiment in this area will have no choice but to take over the A Zone, because it is practically impossible for the Shanghai Volunteer Corps to permanently garrison the area. It is generally pointed out that the members of the corps currently stationed in the "A" Zone are all serving on leave from their normal jobs, causing many inconveniences for the agencies they serve.</p>
<p>Defense Adjustments in Northern A Zone</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Volunteer Corps temporarily took over the defense zone left by the British troops in the Public Concession, the Concession authorities have successively convened British and American troops, and have begun to rotate the defense of the B Zone. A half-squadron of White Russian troops has been temporarily stationed in the D Zone. However, rumors of the Volunteer Corps taking over defense are extremely inaccurate. A reporter from the Pingming News Agency learned yesterday from Chinese and foreign officers of the Volunteer Corps that the Volunteer Corps Headquarters, in view of the "September 18th" anniversary, believed that the Volunteer Corps might need to be fully convened for defense. Therefore, the defense of the northern B Zone was adjusted yesterday by General Commander Hembly of the Volunteer Corps. Because the American B-Company will be fully deployed on the "September 18th" anniversary, there are now new regulations for the defense of the northern B Zone.

From the 15th to the 26th, the A-Company will resume the defense.</p>
<h3 id="e65">Senior Police Officer Yao Ke Attacked Yesterday But Unharmed Yao Bravely Returned Fire, Repelling the Thugs Japanese Military Police Apprehended One Person at the Scene <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>A major shooting incident occurred at the entrance of Lane 749, Yuyuan Road, Shanghai, at approximately 9:10 a.m. yesterday. Two thugs attempted to harm Yao Ke (R.W. Yorke), a British deputy director of the Political Department of the Shanghai Municipal Police. Fortunately, Yao was alert and quickly dodged while drawing his gun to return fire. Many shots were fired by both sides, but none hit. The thugs eventually fled into the crowd. One of the bandits was apprehended by the Japanese Military Police. However, Yao's car, license plate number 8474, had multiple holes in the fenders. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Brave and Capable Officer with Years of Service</p>
<p>Yao Ke, a British deputy director of the Political Department of the Shanghai Municipal Police, is 48 years old and has served in the police for 27 years. He is capable and brave, and therefore deeply valued by his superiors. His home is located in a Western-style house at No. 7, Lane 749, Yuyuan Road, Shanghai. At approximately 9:10 a.m. yesterday, Yao left his residence, wearing a Western-style suit, to go to the police station to handle official business as usual. He was riding in his own car with the Concession license plate number 8474, driven by a Mr. Wang, number five from the Shanghai Municipal Police.</p>
<p>Thugs Ambush and Open Fire</p>
<p>As Yao stepped into the car, the driver started the engine and drove forward. Just as they exited the lane entrance, two thugs, approximately 30 years old and wearing white flannel suits, who had been lying in wait there, saw Yao's car drive out. They both drew new Mauser pistols and opened fire on Yao's car, firing more than ten shots in rapid succession. Two bullets hit the left car door, one hitting the door seam, and another penetrating the left fender. At that time, Yao remained calm, drew his official pistol from the car, and returned fire, firing seven shots. A fierce shootout ensued.</p>
<p>Exchanged Fire, No Casualties</p>
<p>Bullets flew in all directions, and the sound was like firecrackers. Pedestrians scrambled for cover. However, neither side was hit. The thugs, seeing that the situation was not good, fled with their weapons. One bandit was later apprehended by the Japanese Military Police and taken to headquarters for investigation. Subsequently, the Jing'an Temple police station heard the alarm and quickly dispatched a large number of Chinese and Western detectives to pursue them. However, the bandits were gone. Multiple bullet casings were recovered from the scene and taken back to the police station for research. Afterwards, the Shanghai Municipal authorities attached great importance to the case and ordered the police to conduct a thorough investigation.</p>
<p>Yao Ke Describes the Encounter</p>
<p>Yao Ke described his ordeal to a reporter from the English-language Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury as follows: As I (Yao Ke referring to himself) was leaving the lane in the car, I saw two Orientals ahead. When the car reached them, about five to seven yards away, I suddenly saw one of them reach into his pocket. I immediately grabbed the pistol from the seat cushion beside me. The man raised his gun and fired. I also decided to return fire. Another person went around to the back of the car and fired. The driver continued to drive the car out of the street. The person who fired in front of the car ran out of the lane and west along Yuyuan Road towards Zhaofeng Park. He was stopped by a Japanese Military Police officer within twenty yards, who seized his pistol and took him away. The other person disappeared. There were no other pedestrians in the lane during the shooting. I ran out of bullets in my pistol and did not carry any extra ammunition. So, after the incident, I went to the Jing'an Temple police station to report it and then continued to work. Both assailants were wearing clean white flannel suits and were about 30 years old.</p>
<p>Condolences and Congratulations on Escaping Danger from All Sides</p>
<p>According to an inspection of Yao Ke's car, license plate number 8474, there were three bullet holes. One penetrated the left mudguard, and the other two were on the left rear door. Yao Ke was sitting in the left rear seat when he was attacked. One bullet penetrated the rear door and entered the seat cushion, approximately three inches from Yao Ke. Yesterday morning, Yao Ke received phone calls from all sides offering condolences and congratulating him on his narrow escape. Yao Ke has served in the police for over 27 years and enjoys a good reputation. He previously managed the "A" police district. About three years ago, he was transferred to head the special section. He is originally from Nottingham, England, and is 48 years old. He came to Shanghai approximately 30 years ago.</p>

Jardine Matheson has assigned the Minsheng Steamer to be the first to resume service next Wednesday (the 11th), sailing from Shanghai to Haiphong. The steamer is currently en route from Hong Kong to Shanghai and is expected to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow. Guangzhouwan is still in port. As for the source of foreign rice, it has not been interrupted during the suspension of service. Now that the Shanghai-Vietnam route is open, it can come in a steady stream, and rice prices should be suppressed.</p>

<p>The Rice and Grain Valuation Committee convened a standing committee meeting at 3:00 p.m. yesterday. Representatives from the French Concession Public Works Bureau and the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce attended to supervise. All committee members were present. First, the chairman reported the purpose of the meeting. Then, Zhang Lizhong of the Market Management Committee reported on the buying and selling situation of the same industry in the market. Afterwards, Qu Zhenhua, a representative of the Rice Merchants Association, repeatedly advocated that rice prices should not be raised again and suggested that the black market in the market should be severely cracked down. The committee members expressed their opinions, and the situation was quite tense. The general idea was: (1) No. 1 foreign rice is no longer seen in the market. (2) It is hoped that the original price limit will be maintained. (3) In the future, rice and grain transactions must invite representatives from the two Concession authorities and the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce to sign the contract together. (4) To maintain the original price limit, the two authorities and the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce should be asked to provide effective assistance.</p>
<p>Maintain Valuation</p>
<p>The committee's valuation result yesterday was to maintain the maximum price set on the 3rd of this month, and it will be publicly announced to the market this morning for strict enforcement. "For the purpose of public announcement, this committee convened a standing committee meeting on the 6th of this month to discuss the market price of foreign rice. It was resolved to uphold the intentions of the two Concession authorities and resolutely maintain the price set on the 3rd of this month. The market is hereby publicly announced to strictly comply, and black market and other matters are strictly prevented. If there are any deliberate violations, anyone can report them, and the authorities will be asked to severely punish them. In addition to reporting to the two Concession authorities, it is appropriate to record the instructions and hope that everyone will be fully aware of them. This is hereby announced. Attached is the price set on September 3, which is: No. 1 Saigon Siam 61.5 yuan, Firemark 61 yuan, No. 2 Saigon Siam 59 yuan, Small Mill 58.5 yuan, Gao Dongjing Usu Rice 56 yuan, Dongjing Brown Rice 52 yuan, Millet Green 50 yuan, Mixed Broken 46 yuan."</p>
<p>Sudden Reversal</p>
<p>Shipping between Shanghai and Haiphong was restored the day before yesterday, and various shipping companies have also begun to dispatch ships. Since the news was published in the newspapers, speculative rice merchants have been caught off guard. They all believe that with the resumption of shipping between Shanghai and Haiphong, the source of rice and grain can continue to arrive, and people's hearts are unanimously weakening. Large households are lowering prices to sell off. After the rice store tea party market opened in the morning, the initial market showed weakness. Spot goods flooded the market, and supply exceeded demand, with a sharp drop of about three or four yuan. It is self-evident that rice profiteers deliberately exceeded the price limit in the previous few days. The day before yesterday, the Tongcheng Company on Jiangxi Road transported 16,000 bags of foreign rice from Saigon, which were unloaded and entered the warehouse yesterday. In addition, 32,000 bags of Saigon foreign rice will arrive today. Therefore, the rice reserves in this city will become more and more abundant, and there is no risk of shortage of the entire people's food.</p>
<p>Arrested Rice Profiteers</p>
<p>Due to the manipulation of a large amount of rice by speculators, the market situation of Japanese rice and grain has caused rice prices to rise frequently. The police authorities of the two Concessions have increased staff and stationed them in the market to monitor the buying and selling of each company. The day before yesterday morning, a rice profiteer, Chen Rongshan, the manager of the Yitai Rice Store on Zhejiang Road, purchased a certain amount of No. 2 Siam foreign rice from the Jufeng Rice Store in the Zhonghui Building (its agent is Mao Jian-sui). The transaction price was 61.7 yuan per stone (the price limit is 59 yuan), and the transaction was brokered by Mo Jinting. Tao Zhonggao, an agent of the Yuanhecheng on Dongxin Bridge, reported to the resident police detective on the spot and he was taken to the Central Police Station. After separate interrogations, it was rumored that he was released at 5:00 p.m. that afternoon, which is probably not true. It is believed that the authorities will not let him go so easily.</p>
<p>Suspension of Low-Price Rice Sales</p>
<p>The Shanghai Low-Price Rice Sales Committee decided at its 15th standing committee meeting to temporarily suspend the fourth phase of low-price broken rice sales from tomorrow. As for the fifth phase of low-price sales, it will continue and is scheduled to begin on the 19th of this month. 60,000 bags of broken rice will be sold, all of which have been shipped from Yuncheng, the place of origin. After this phase is completed, there will still be more than 56,000 bags, enough for two months of low-price sales. However, after this batch of foreign rice is sold out, the committee will temporarily come to an end and handle the closing affairs.</p>
<p>Supply Is Not Scarce</p>
<p>The Continental Daily reported that an official of the French Concession Public Works Bureau told reporters yesterday (the 5th) that the efforts of the Shanghai Municipal Council and the "City Government" to jointly adjust the supply and price of food for the people in the Shanghai area have achieved satisfactory results. The official believes that the current supply of rice and grain is as good as ever, and Shanghai can now obtain a large supply of Saigon rice. Before the European War, France purchased approximately 800,000 tons of rice from Vietnam annually. Now, due to the lack of ships, the rice and grain cannot be shipped to Europe and must find other sales channels in the Far East. The French Concession has sufficient stocks of rice, flour, and other important foods.</p>
<p>No Need to Panic</p>
<p>Therefore, there is no reason for residents to fear a food shortage due to the rising prices of rice and flour. The French Concession Price Equalization Committee, established on March 1, aims to curb manipulation and hoarding and arbitrary price increases by retailers and wholesalers, and to assist merchants in replenishing stocks at any time. In order to make price control effective, the Price Equalization Committee has obtained the cooperation of the administrative authorities of the adjacent districts to benefit residents. Since the establishment of the Price Equalization Committee, it has met once a week, and representatives from the Shanghai Municipal Council Food Subcommittee also attend.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Saviour Church of the Chinese Anglican Church has been rebuilt on Zhao Bishop Road for more than a year. The style is modern and grand, and the cost is considerable. It is the only great cathedral among the churches at sea, capable of accommodating more than a thousand believers. Therefore, the sanctuary of the church was not completed until last month. At the board meeting in August, it was decided that the dedication service for the sanctuary would be held at 10:00 a.m. on the 8th of this month. The chairman of the Advisory Committee of the Diocese, the Reverend Bu Fangji, will be invited to preach, and there will be a choir, accompanied by special anthems. Those who wish to listen to Reverend Bu's sermon and music are welcome to come to the church.</p>

<p>The English-language Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury reported that it was recently learned that French Consul General Ouin, stationed in Shanghai, will leave Shanghai in mid-September to take up a new position in Australia. This matter has not yet been officially announced, but it is heard that Ouin will soon receive instructions from the French government. French Consul Douvier, stationed in Shanghai, has been appointed to temporarily take charge of the affairs of the French Consulate here, pending the arrival of Ouin's successor. However, the successor has not yet been appointed by the Vichy government. Ouin has been serving as Consul General in Shanghai since 1937, together with Baux de la Pagerie. About five months ago, Baux left Shanghai, and Ouin has been fully responsible since then. Ouin was born in France on February 26, 1895. He joined the French Army during World War I and performed meritorious service, earning a military medal. In 1920, he worked for the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and then served as French Consul in Shantou and Vancouver, before being transferred to Shanghai.</p>

<p>After a Pacific hurricane left Shanghai and moved out to sea, dissipating over the Sea of Japan, a second hurricane has appeared. According to a report from the Xujiahui Observatory at 6:00 a.m. yesterday, it has reached 23 degrees north latitude and 130 degrees east longitude, heading northwest by west, with the center within 60 nautical miles. According to the above report, the hurricane has reached the sea southeast of Okinawa and is gradually approaching the Chinese coast. If the direction remains unchanged, the threat to Shanghai from the hurricane will increase. Therefore, the Jianghai Customs and the Observatory have been paying attention to its development. According to another report from the Observatory, another hurricane has risen in the Pacific, currently located at 24 degrees north latitude and 145.3 degrees east longitude, with the center within 120 nautical miles, heading northwest. The trend is still unclear.</p>

<p>Retiring Commercial Counselor An Litede, before his departure from Shanghai, gave a ten-minute broadcast at XMHO radio station at 12:30 noon yesterday to bid farewell to people here. His speech stated, "Many of my friends in China regret the separation of my wife and me. For example, Dr. Bu Fangji, who has been in China for 54 years, believes that leaving before him is equivalent to abandoning the journey halfway. However, I am comforted by the fact that my task has been handed over to capable successors, and that half of my family remains in China, namely two sons and one daughter, who still wish to reside here. They possess the optimistic spirit of their parents."</p>
<p>"Their unwillingness to return to the country with my wife and me is not forced. My wife and I plan to settle in Mill Valley or Berkeley in the San Francisco Bay Area. Many Americans who have lived in China for a long time choose to reside in California after returning to their country, where talent and culture gather. They have almost pioneered an area as a residence for those who have returned to America after living in China. In the past thirty-eight years, I have strived to introduce China to the United States." "Now, as my wife and I prepare to retire and return home, I would like to take this opportunity to first thank my Chinese, American, and other friends who have bid farewell to my wife and me in recent days. I am deeply grateful for the banquets and hospitality you have provided. Secondly, I bid farewell to my countless friends, especially those in mainland China today. Due to the situation, my wife and I cannot bid farewell in person, which is deeply regrettable. My wife and I hope that your future is bright, and we silently pray for the day of China's revival, which is not far away." After Mr. and Mrs. An finished the broadcast, they boarded the Dutch postal ship "Zhishalianjia" at 2 PM, leaving Shanghai for Hong Kong, waiting to take the Pan American Clipper to the United States.</p>

Many Japanese are unworthy of the name of Japanese. Those who have recently come to Shanghai from Japan are only interested in profit and engage in exchange rate speculation, daring to act contrary to the policies of the Japanese government. It is hoped that Japanese residents in Shanghai will understand the intentions of the authorities and abide by national policies.</p>

<p>In order to ensure the peace and order of the citizens, the police authorities of the two concessions have taken strict precautions. According to a senior official of the police department, the purpose of these precautionary measures is only to prevent the occurrence of unexpected events and to ensure the good order within the territory. Various rumors are purely groundless. In the Public Concession, in view of the effective security measures taken before and after the "August 13th" incident, the precautions have been extended. The French Concession has implemented special precautions since 11 PM on the 3rd, also because the results have been excellent, so it will continue to maintain security within the territory.</p>
<p>Divided Entry and Exit</p>
<p>Since the French Concession police authorities implemented precautions from 11 PM on the 3rd, the barbed wire frames placed on the roads adjacent to Avenue Edward VII have not been removed as of yesterday. Only the gaps left on the Bund, Tianzhutang Street, Dongxinqiao, Min Ti Ni Yin Road, Shengmuyuan Road, Avenue Albert, and Haige Road have been reinforced with iron carts and armed Chinese and Western detectives stationed there. Yesterday, ropes were also added nearby, and pedestrians entered and exited in separate lanes, with excellent order. The detectives at each location inspected vehicles and pedestrians entering and exiting very carefully. The patrol teams within the concession were also very active, and shops in the alleys were still being inspected. Armored police vehicles also patrolled all day without letting up.</p>
<p>Checking Permits</p>
<p>The Public Concession is still continuing the precautions implemented since the 9th of last month. Barbed wire frames are still placed on the roads leading to the French Concession and the bridges over the Suzhou Creek, and detectives are stationed there. The barbed wire can be set up and blocked at any time when necessary. The enforcement of the night curfew has become stricter than before, and the permits carried by those passing through are carefully examined. About a hundred people are detained and punished every day. In the "Ding" area of ​​western Shanghai, after the entry of the Japanese military police for patrol, they have been traveling back and forth frequently for days, and constantly intercepting and searching vehicles and rickshaws on Bailinan Road and Pingyuan Road.</p>

<p>The leader of the Salvation Army in this city, Maurice, returned to Shanghai from Qingdao on the 5th of this month after completing his summer vacation. A reporter from the Pingming News Agency visited Mr. Mao yesterday to inquire about relief work. He said that with the price of rice soaring to about 70 yuan per picul, it is really difficult for the poor to make a living. The Salvation Army is stepping up its rice distribution work and has allocated 2,000 yuan for rice distribution expenses this month. At the same time, he hoped that rice merchants would try their best to suppress rice prices and show compassion for the poor. He also said that as autumn is approaching and severe winter is coming soon, he has already planned to set up a beggar shelter, planning to accommodate 1,000 to 2,000 beggars. The location has not yet been determined. As for the street tea carts that were established this summer, they will be canceled due to the cooler weather. However, in the cold autumn weather, there is still a need for ordinary laborers to quench their thirst after work, so the tea distribution item has been decided to continue.</p>

<p>Ye Shuyuan, a 26-year-old native of Pudong, residing at No. 43, Jijiagang Lane, Youyifang, No. 410 Jin Shenfu Road, recently entrusted lawyer Jin Yu to file a complaint with the Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court, accusing Tang Xipin (37 years old) and Tang Guansan (62 years old), a father and son living at No. 69 Jinyeli, Laoshenfu Road, of jointly conspiring to defraud him of property. It is alleged that the plaintiff, seeing that order in the city was gradually restored and the market was turning around, learned that a building at No. 17 Guanyinge Street in the South City belonged to the defendants and immediately rented it from the first defendant. It is claimed that someone else had already reserved the house and that he had to find a way to "dig out" the tenant. The plaintiff believed it to be true and immediately paid a "dig out" deposit of 300 yuan, for which the first defendant issued a receipt, stating that if the lease was not concluded in the future, the original amount would be returned. At the time of payment and receipt, the second defendant, the father of the first defendant, was also present to discuss the matter and did not express any objections. Unexpectedly, when the plaintiff later went to formally rent the house, the first defendant claimed that he had no right to dispose of it, and when the plaintiff reasoned with him, he flatly refused to admit it and made excuses, avoiding meeting him. The defendants' behavior clearly showed a joint conspiracy to defraud him of property, committing a crime under Article 339 of the Criminal Law, and he is also filing a civil suit to recover the deposit of 300 yuan. The court, based on the complaint, held a trial yesterday by Judge Tang. The defendants admitted issuing the receipt, but denied actually receiving the plaintiff's deposit. After verifying the statements in court and questioning both parties in detail, the court, finding that the facts were clear, ordered closing arguments, declared the trial concluded, and scheduled a date for the verdict. It is noted that the second defendant, Tang Guansan, was also accused of illegal occupation of rent before summer and was convicted in the Second Special District Court and fined 500 yuan. The appeal is still pending.</p>

<p>Liu Huizhi, a giant in the banking industry, has a son named Liu Zikang, who has been married to Zhou Shiru, the daughter of Zhou Wuchang, the head of the Zhou Zishan family, for more than ten years. The couple's feelings were quite harmonious at first, and they have three children. In recent years, there has been discord between the two sexes, and there have been times of conflict. Recently, Zhou Shiru entrusted a lawyer to file a complaint with the Civil Court of the First Special District Court, requesting a divorce from her husband, Liu Zikang. The reason stated that the defendant, Liu Zikang, has suffered from mental illness in recent years and has been treated by both Chinese and Western doctors, but there is no hope of recovery. Although the plaintiff is now a middle-aged woman, the defendant's illness has no hope of recovery, which has a significant impact on the plaintiff's happiness. Therefore, she has no choice but to sue for divorce. The case was summoned yesterday by Judge Tao. The defendant, Liu Zikang, was unable to appear in court in Wuhu. His father, Liu Huizhi, entrusted lawyer Shan Yuhua to appear in court, stating the reason why the defendant, Liu Zikang, was unable to appear in court and submitting two handwritten letters written by Liu Zikang as evidence. The plaintiff, Zhou Shiru's lawyer, said that the defendant's incurable disease made it unlikely that he could write letters. The court, considering that the case involved a marital dispute, earnestly persuaded both parties to reconcile. The defendant's side stated that paintings and antiques worth tens of thousands of yuan were all in the plaintiff's possession, and the two sides had a major dispute over this issue. However, both parties agreed to go outside to conduct a reconciliation. The court immediately ordered the case to be rescheduled for further hearing.</p>

<p>The landlord of Continental Fang on Luban Road in the French Concession recently entrusted Zhu Yisheng Law Firm's Management Department to send a letter to all tenants, stating that from October of this year, the rent will be increased by 50% across the board based on the original rent amount. After receiving the notice, the tenants of the building all stated that the rent there had already been increased once at the request of the landlord after August 13th, and it has not been long since then. Now, they want to increase the rent by as much as 50% on the pretext, which is actually unbearable. Therefore, they unanimously expressed resistance and will deal with it according to the law.</p>

<p>In early last month, Zhang Decai, a detective at the Public Concession General Inspectorate, arrested five men and women, including Chen Zhangshi, who were involved in child trafficking, at 21 Yichengfang, Yuezhou Road, and 2 Zhenzhuchang Road, Xujiahui, based on reports. Subsequently, based on their confessions, he went to Gulangyu with Japanese detective Nakamura Hideo to request assistance from the local police station, arresting four principal offenders, including Su Desan. He also found sixteen boys who had been sold. In order to facilitate matters, the police authorities took photos of all the boys and girls and gave them to Detective Zhang to bring to Shanghai for identification by the families of the missing children. The children are still temporarily being raised by the buyers. Once a family identifies a photo, the Central Police Station will telegraph the Gulangyu Municipal Council to send officers to escort them to Shanghai. It is hoped that the families of the missing children will go to Room 307, 3rd Floor, Central Police Station, Fourth Horse Road, between 9 and 12 AM and 2 and 4 PM every day to contact Detective Zhang to identify the photos.</p>

<h3 id="e89">Joke About a Chicken Wedding <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>I have heard that in the customs of Hubei Province there is a saying of marrying a donkey as a wife, that is, people marry a female donkey ten or a few days before marrying a wife. The method is to wash the female donkey clean, put a red felt on the donkey's body, and pin a golden flower on the donkey's head. The groom, wearing his clothes and hat, kowtows to heaven, earth, ancestors, and ancestors. He enters the bridal chamber at night, and the donkey is tied in the room. The groom lies on the bed. From then on, the family members regard the donkey as the young mistress and never whip or tame it. Now I hear that there is a chicken wedding in Lingnan, which is really true. In the remote rural areas of Fanshun Township in Lingnan, there are people who go abroad to trade after betrothing a wife but before marrying; by the time they grow up, the husband has not yet returned, so there is a chicken wedding ceremony. The method is to choose a rooster, and on an auspicious day, lead the bride to kowtow to it, just like the donkey wife in Hubei, and the bride then lives in the husband's house to serve her in-laws. Last month, a certain He in a rural village in Panyu had a son who was engaged to a certain Mo in the village, who was sixteen years old. He followed people to trade in Singapore, and has not returned for five years. The woman is already old, and the father followed the custom and performed the chicken wedding. On the auspicious day, the bride was carried in a sedan chair. The family members then led the chicken in a cage to kowtow. Unexpectedly, the chicken fell over when touched, because the clucking chicken had already gone to the underworld. For a time, the family members and guests did not know what to do, so they abandoned the chicken and simply performed the ceremony with only the bride. At this time, old women and others spread rumors, saying that the groom was abroad and that something unlucky might happen. Looking at the scene, there are those who cannot help but burst into laughter! As the saying goes, "Marry a chicken and follow the chicken," that's what it means.</p>

<h3 id="e91">Death <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Kui</p>
<p>The son of the woman in the kitchen downstairs died. That child, who was just able to jump, laugh, and was five or six years old.</p>
<p>I went downstairs and saw a piece of cloth lying horizontally on the ground inside, with bright colors; if there were no women wailing in grief, screaming, and raising their disheveled hair, tearing their faces with tears like a whip, perhaps someone would think it was a quilt that had accidentally fallen.</p>
<p>People were silently half-surrounding the doorway, quietly.</p>
<p>Outside the street, a dark mass was looking around; I saw a few of this child's playmates, staring with big black eyes, as if a little horrified by this sorrowful screaming.</p>
<p>Soon, the distraught father rushed in from the door, this worker threw his straw hat back, pulled open his already unbuttoned shirt, revealing his strong chest. Looking at his crazy wife and the child on the ground, he bent down to lift the cloth, but raised his hand again at the touch of it. The corners of his mouth, in the public's gaze, strangely wrinkled, as if he had drunk a bitter wine.</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>Death, what a big deal is it here?</p>
<p>Apart from the beggars who freeze and starve to death, almost every season there are three or five bluish-purple dead infants thrown on the side of the road in the alley.</p>
<p>However, the person who hugged the dead child is starting to wrap their body with burning incense sticks. Waving like someone using the fire stick of a magic act, and also chanting something, like a spell, fearing that death has a little bit of love for her. ……</p>
<p>In fact, what is death really?</p>
<p>The children ran away and went to play. A mother holding a baby, although her face turned green at the time, softly sang a lullaby when she reached the entrance of the alley.</p>
<p>For the dead child, it can also be regarded as being spared a hardship. He is eternally at rest, spared the bullying given to him by many decent children on the street, and spared the scolding sometimes given by his parents in anger. In this year, the cries of scolding children are rising faster than prices!</p>
<p>Death, perhaps only gives the weeping mother the present pain, and after a few months or a year or two, when she has another child, she will have infinite joy again.</p>
<p>It is said that the child's death was only a matter of a few hours. He suffered from convulsions that many loose medicines and doctors could cure.</p>
<p>But he died.</p>
<p>"...The neighborhood is having a Taiping Gong Zhai ceremony, this child can be considered to know how to die." An old woman with bound feet said murmurmingly, holding a string of destiny beads.</p>
<p>I thought: People are born and die randomly, from ancient times to now. Who can determine exactly what kind of person this child will become in the future? This clear-faced child has intelligent eyes. But he died. Leaving behind the sobbing of that young woman.</p>
<p>And the resentful sobbing also has a time of silence!</p>
<p>In a novel by Zuo Zhuli, he imagined that there should be a: "Strict Citizen Survival Review Committee" to judge whether citizens are fit to survive; and to order citizens who are not fit to survive to end their lives within twenty-four hours.</p>
<p>Now, how many people who should die have not died!</p>

<p>— Translated by Su Renjie</p>
<p>Alexander came to an African village, and the chief entertained him very warmly, placing golden fruits and bread before him. Alexander asked curiously, "Do you eat gold here?"</p>
<p>"I think you must be able to find things to eat in your own country. Why did you come here for anything other than gold?" the chief replied.</p>
<p>"Your gold cannot lead me here..." Alexander said, "But I would like to know some of your customs and habits."</p>
<p>Just then, two natives came in, bowed deeply to the chief, and the first one opened his mouth and said, "I bought a piece of land from him. When I was digging a trench, I suddenly discovered a treasure. When I bought it from him, I did not buy this treasure inside, so it should be his, but he refuses to accept it."</p>
<p>The second one replied, "I hope I have a good conscience like them. When I sold this piece of land, it naturally included everything, and this treasure should be his."</p>
<p>The chief pondered for a while, then asked, "Do you have a son?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>The chief then asked the other one: "Do you have a daughter?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Good," the chief ruled: "Your son will marry his daughter, and give this treasure to the new couple as a dowry."</p>
<p>Alexander watched from the side and was very surprised. Seeing this, the chief asked, "Do you think my judgment is incorrect?" "Oh, no, but I am very surprised," Alexander replied.</p>
<p>"Then how is such a thing judged in your country!" the chief asked again.</p>
<p>"To be honest, we confiscate this treasure and send it to the emperor."</p>
<p>Now it was the chief's turn to be surprised. After hearing this, he shouted loudly: "For the emperor's use? Is there a sun over there?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Does it rain over there?"</p>
<p>"Of course!"</p>
<p>"Strange! But are there grazing animals over there?"</p>
<p>"Many, of all kinds."</p>
<p>"Ah! That's right." The chief said with a sudden realization: "For the sake of these innocent animals, God is willing to continue to let sunlight and raindrops fall on your country."</p>

<p>Chapter Six: A Dangerous Experience</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou nodded repeatedly in agreement, replying, "That's easy. Should I take care of it right away—"</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou did not finish his sentence when his right hand had already reached for the electric bell button next to the desk, ready to press it to call in the errand boy outside. Unexpectedly, there were two light knocks on the office door, and a uniformed errand boy had already pushed his way in, holding a business card in his hand. Ni Jinshou took the card and glanced at it, reading aloud, "Lu Jiansheng." He looked up at Huo Sang, as if asking whether to grant an audience. Huo Sang thought for a moment and nodded. Ni Jinshou relayed the same action to the errand boy.</p>
<p>A minute later, Lu Jiansheng, with his head held high and his big belly sticking out, strolled in. He was quite tall and large, with a round, plump face that was fair and tender. Although his hair was already balding, he looked to be over fifty, but he didn't seem old. He had a flat, large nose, sparse, light eyebrows, and a pair of lively eyes that seemed very cunning. In fact, this pair of eyes was truly his only magic weapon, capable of exerting power, flattering, and adapting to circumstances with ease. When he strolled in, his eyes seemed to be set on the "exerting power" button. He wore a light gray, thin flannel robe and a pair of shiny, black leather shoes. When I saw his shoes, my heart skipped a beat. They were quite large and had a round toe.</p>
<p>As he walked in, Ni Jinshou had already stood up respectfully, greeting him with, "Mr. Lu, please have a seat." Lu Jiansheng merely nodded. The distance of the head movement, front to back, was no more than two inches, and it remained held high. He held a cigar between the index and middle fingers of his right hand, waved it casually, and sat down on the white cloth-covered sofa opposite us. Huo Sang merely glanced at the man out of the corner of his eye and continued to sit with his right knee held up. I did not stand up either. Lu Jiansheng did not greet us, as if only others greeted him, and he never greeted others first as a rule.</p>
<p>He cleared his throat and began to say to Ni Jinshou, "Well? Have you found the murderer yet?"</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou was stunned for a moment before sitting down and replying, "Mr. Lu, this case is very complicated. I still don't know who the murderer is—"</p>
<p>Lu Jiansheng's powerful eyes gained even more elements of power. "What? You still don't know who the murderer is? What have you been doing all this time?"</p>
<p>I felt that the word "you" seemed to include me and Huo Sang as well. I was a little annoyed. Huo Sang, however, kept his eyes half-open and half-closed, as if he were resting, and made no expression at all. Ni Jinshou was a little embarrassed. He glanced at Huo Sang and then back at Lu Jiansheng. At this moment, an errand boy came in carrying a tray with four cups of tea, placing them in front of each person, and then walked back out, which finally weakened the tense atmosphere a little.</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou said, "Mr. Lu, this case involves more than one person. Mr. Huo and Mr. Bao—ah, let me introduce you. This is Mr. Huo Sang, and this is Mr. Bao Lang—" (99)</p>

<p>Who were the first actors in film? It is now known that the first to act in film were not people, but horses. The horses' names were Occident, Wildflower, Sunol, and E'echioneer.</p>
<p>These four horses performed in Palo Alto, California, between 1878 and 1879. The first commemorative film can be seen at the Stanford Muybridge Exposition. Horses were the earliest experimental subjects in film. At that time, there were no cameras like those we have today. These horse stars' photos were taken with a series of twenty-four slow-motion cameras. They themselves were the photographers. As they walked past the camera box, they pulled the camera closer with ropes, thus taking the photos.</p>
<p>The 50th anniversary of this event was held at Stanford University, attended by many film entrepreneurs. Alec Biffle Romsey spoke on behalf of the filmmakers, saying that he paid tribute to the first photographed horse, Occident, and erected a monument on the grass to commemorate this earliest success.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Island Theater Talk <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>— Weiwei</p>
<p>Recently, the Beijing-style opera stars invited by Huang Jin have been arriving in a steady stream. However, in terms of supporting roles, the martial arts actors are always Wu Yanheng and Gao Shenglin, the painted-face actors are always Qiu Shengrong and Yuan Shihai, and everything else is nothing more than the familiar faces of Ye Shengjian, Ma Fulu, Guan Shengxi, and Ai Shiju. It is very likely that the audience will suspect that the so-called birthplace of famous actors, Beijing, has no one else besides these people. In fact, the old capital is full of talent; it is just that many famous actors are either too arrogant or have strange tempers, resulting in few opportunities to come south. Huang Jin is now preparing to break through this difficulty and wants to invite a few of these famous actors who are unwilling to come south easily. It is said that two famous actors are currently in negotiations with Huang Jin, namely Hou Xirui and Ru Fulan.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Hou Xirui Invited to Come South <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Hou Xirui is the best Jing (painted face) talent from Fu Liancheng. Not only do the general Jing actors produced by Fu Liancheng learn from him, but he is also one of the top three Jing actors today. In terms of art, except for his voice not being as good as Hao Jin's, his martial arts skills, posture, facial makeup, and aura are all above Hao Jin and the other. In his prime, Hou Xirui was part of six troupes in the old capital. Mei (Lanfang), Yang (Xiaolou), Cheng (Yanqiu), and Shang (Xiaoyun) all regarded him as their right-hand man. The last time Xirui came to Shanghai was with Mei Lanfang, which was more than a dozen years ago. Since then, Cheng Yanqiu invited him to come south twice, but neither came to fruition, partly because he was unwilling to come south and partly because he was too arrogant, wanting to bring nine assistants with him, which made the theater owners shake their heads. As a result, people in Jiangnan have not had the opportunity to see this artist for more than a decade. Huang Jin is now sending people to Ping to contact Xiao Cuihua, and at the same time, is sincerely inviting Hou Xirui.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Ru Fulan Likely to Come to Shanghai <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Ru Fulan is also an outstanding talent from Fu Liancheng. He originally studied martial arts as a Xiaosheng (young male character), but later became a martial arts actor after graduating. In recent years, due to nearsightedness, he was unsuitable for performing martial arts plays and returned to being a Xiaosheng from a martial arts actor. Fulan's art is quite unique. His masterpieces such as "Battle of Puyang," "Eight Hammers, Second Visit to the Village," and "Night Flight" can be called the best in today's Peking opera world. Ye Shenglan's martial arts skills were all learned from Fulan. Therefore, Shenglan's "Battle of Puyang" and other top plays can also enjoy great fame. In the martial arts actor line, after Yang Xiaolou, Zhou Ruian, Sun Yukun, and Ru Fulan were the three successors to the Yang school. Now that Ruian is gradually entering old age, Yukun and Fulan are both in their prime. Although, on the whole, Fulan may be slightly inferior to Yukun, Fulan is beyond the reach of the later generation of martial arts actors. Huang Jin had intended to invite Fulan when he invited Li Shengzao last time, but it did not materialize because Fulan was unwilling to play the Xiaosheng role. Now that the old matter is being brought up again, it has been decided to invite him to play the martial arts actor role, coming together with Xiao Cuihua or Xin Yanqiu. This matter is likely to be resolved without problems.</p>

<p>The secrets of the silver screen can be said to be countless. Here, I will talk to you about two that can be seen in almost every film.</p>
<p>The first is the shot of breaking glass. Readers should not believe that the broken glass is real. So what exactly is used to replace it? For a period of time, a sugary substance was used, but recently, rosin has been used instead.</p>
<p>The second is shots of drinking and the like. In fact, actors in films mostly drink herbal tea instead of alcohol! And the use of ginger ale as champagne is also unknown to outsiders.</p>
