<h3>英國公開警告日本　不再採取綏靖政策　決重開緬甸路積極援華　同時對美加速進行談話</h3>
<p>倫敦　英政府昨晚公開警告日本、謂英國參戰以來、已一年有餘、根據過往經騐、深悟不應再對日人、採取安撫（或綏靖）政策矣、此間英官員、對日外相松岡洋右廣播演說、予以尖銳之答覆、英政府某發言人云「日本或卽將發覺日下英政府所抱態度、較之一年以前已大非昔比」、此間一般咸認、發言人之聲明、爲英國已決心生開滇緬路之前奏、準備一俟十月十八日英·日協定滿期後、卽可從該一公路運輸軍火、供給重慶政府至英國所以改變態度者、實爲日本與軸心國哦發生聯繫之反響、按英國此種表現、爲對日態度強硬之嚆矢、亦卽英國準備將來與美國完全合作、再謀更進一步的報復日本、俾對日本在亞洲之侵略行動、得以取償、（二十九日合衆社電）</p>
<p>倫敦　英國報紙雖頗注意於德·義·日新約、然絕無驚惶或憂慮之表示、一般與情似以爲、此約使大局無甚變化、不過使以前雖無其名而有其實之一種局勢結晶化耳、就英國而言、歐洲戰爭之狀况、不致受仟何釋度之影響、現有一、二事確可使人興奮者、一爲美國報紙之態度、此約雖以美國爲主要對象、然美國政策毫無受此威嚇影響、或美國與諭稱形軟弱之表微、美國顯然仍欲進行共已定之方針、不加改變、一爲東京方面對於此約並不若德·義之誇張、此外、尚有術重要之一點、卽蘇聯態度是已、每日電聞稱、蘇聯定將感覺此約置蘇聯於冷藏室中、並警告蘇聯如干涉歐洲或中國戰爭、則將遭西兩方之夾攻、此約對美雖較直接，然日本旣在華陷於泥淖中、自不能對美作可怖之威脅、故美國仍可目決其地位、而置此的於不理云、該報外交訪員稱、據所接消息察之、莫斯科似不以此的爲滿意、殆以此新的乃放大的反英協定也、就英國而言、倫敦欲調解中，日戰事之努力、將因此而中止云、泰晤士報外交訪員稱、英·美關於中國件之談話、將趕速進行、而達於與此新的相適應之重要程度、泰晤士報外交訪員又稱、德·義·日三角盟約、以第三條規定締約國之一、被現未參加對英虞爭或中·日戰爭之一國所攻擊、則締約國允在軍事上互相援助者助者爲重要、其用意在威嚇美國、或使美國於不　共威嚇時、轉移其準備由大西洋而至太平洋耳、日本於此或可有助於軸心國、但軸心國如何可有助於日本、則殊不易見、德·義軍隊不能開到遠東、彼等自己方亟需海軍之襄助、與原料、軍火之供給、又安能以軍力與原料供應日本乎、新聞紀事報社論稱、此的顯爲威嚇美國嘗試、今可斷言、其不能成功、侵略國三角同盟、尙未有去年之蘇、德公的、則定已早日成立、日本對此蘇、德公的固爲之猜忌忿怒也、日本遭遇中國方面之繼續奮戰、復感原料供給之縮减、處境日危、日本現願正式締此盟的者、殆爲此歟、以實際方面言、侵略國之盟的、適使英·澳·美三方面關於太平洋防務問題之談判、因以推進而已、（二十九日路透社電）</p>
<p>倫敦　泰晤士報論德·義·日公的謂、此三國最以美國干涉爲懼、軸心國顯然願日本封鎖亞洲、以不利於美國、庶使美國資源不能爲英國後援、而日本在進行其侵略以威脅美國勢力之前、亦願有奧援、縱屬紙上空談、究竟聊勝於無、此乃觀於日本報紙仇視美國之論調而可知者、（二十九日路透社電）</p>
<h3>蘇電台報告　越南局勢　太平洋之緊張　現已與日俱進</h3>
<p>倫敦　莫斯科無綫電台報吿員、今日檢討越南之發展時、謂太平洋之緊張、現與日俱進、該報吿員雖未提及德·義·日之公的、但曾綜述日·美·英及其他方面對於日本在越南行動之官方文吿、及報紙批評、（廿九日路透電）</p>

<p>紐約　紐約世界電報昨日載稱、美國正迅速準備、傾向戰事之途、該報對過去四十八小時中所有發展、重行予以追述、計有美國禁運碎鐵命令、美國貸款、一千五百萬美元與中國、德·義·日之三强軍事協定、及英大使洛齊安發表之聲明等、該報呼籲國會應切實考慮、是吾宜戰抑或拒絕宜戰」、（二十九日合衆電）</p>

<h3>威爾斯演說　斥德義日　美決竭力援英　重視遠東權益</h3>
<p>克里夫蘭　美國務副卿威爾斯稱、美國將竭其全力、以援助英國、俾得爲其生存而戰鬥、同時斥責德·義之侵略、並謂、日本不顧遠反其在法律及道義方面之義務、僅思假藉武力、以遂其在東亞建設新秩序之素願、彼繼續作警戒語稱、「此或爲影響美國獨立與生存最急之時期、」（二十九日合衆社電）</p>
<p>克里夫蘭　美國國務卿威爾斯昨在此聲稱、日本之欲造成其亞洲新秩序、已明白表示欲獨自汰定在遠東之美國歷史上利益、與美人條的上權利、應限於何種程度、破壞美國權益之事件、巳發生數百起、但未有不能以談判方式和平解決之難題、祇須有關係方面如有誠意、以覓取平等公允之解決、對於有關係者之權益與眞正需要、予以適當之承認耳、惟美國必須準備各種意外事件、趕緊武裝、防衛我新世界、以禦刻在威脅吾人之危險、美洲各共和國密切關係之發展、乃近年國際關係中好現象之一、（二十九日路透社電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　咋日美政府對新近簽訂之德·義·日三國公的、猛烈抨擊、並昭示共政策、謂尖將以「物質援助予諸火屬地、一始援助英國內人民然、國務副卿威爾斯在克里夫蘭城外交會議席上吿極權國家曰、美對英無限制之援助、今後將擴至澳洲與紐四蘭、官方稱、美對英援助之擴大、或將使美與德·義·日同時衝突、談及美國需要遠東貿易機會平等時、威爾斯稱、羅總統重振軍備之程序、已使其足以應付「一切事變」、威爾斯於談及三國公的對於戰略上重要時稱、西半球各國須構成一不能攻克之陣綫、最後將美國之遠東政策、簡述如下、（一）各國對美國人士之合法權利須完全尊重、（二）尊重美國參加之一切國際條的協定、（三）各國貿易機會均等、（一十九日國際社電</p>
<h3>日與澳洲關係　已生障碍　澳海相盼英決定　全帝國戰爭政策</h3>
<p>西德尼　據此間觀察者昨晚相信、日本與軸心國家簽日軍事及經濟的協定、顯然在澳洲企圖與日本增進友好關係程途中、設一障碍、三强協定、乃此間一般早已料及必致發生之表現、蓋此三集權國家、向均有此狼狽爲奸之態度、澳洲官員深信、此一軍車協定、直接在打擊美國、使其不得不對遠東決定一基本政策、（二十九日合衆社電）</p>
<p>雪梨　澳洲海相凱隆、昨在此評論德義日公的謂、此的甚關重要、以其打開國際問題之整個關係也、日本此舉久在意料中的、如此次戰爭須沿英帝國邊綫進行、則英帝國亟宜有對於英帝國全部之戰爭政策、（二十九日路透社電）</p>

<h3>三國盟約的締結與遠東</h3>
<p>關於德義日三國盟的的簽訂、昨日本報旣予剖析、茲請進而申明其對於遠東局勢以至日本本身的影響。固然，所謂三國盟的，只是世人意想中的虛聲恫嚇，而且也是因爲彼此都未能迅償夙願纔出此末策，但在三國本身，却未必不對此懷具莫大期望，認爲未來前途所寄託。允其是久患孤立的日本，於到處碰壁之餘，竟一舉而獲兩個極權强國爲與國，總應該感到絕大的躊躇滿志吧！而最近的越南糾紛，日方之所以不顧英美警告而悍然出於武力行動，無疑的正是恃此一行將締結的同盟關係爲護符。但縱觀日方連日景象，並未見十分興奮。即如其政府當軸的表示：松岡則喻爲以國運爲孤注，近衛則籲請人民犧牲及服從；於揄揚其成就之中，轉深形不安之色。足見日方此一舉措，絲毫不能顯示其國際地位的好轉，反而是投身於新的更大的冒險；其前途的休戚禍福，即在手訂此一盟的的日本當局，也並不表示具有何等把握。</p>
<p>所謂德義日三國締盟，並不是個新的問題，而只是年餘以來遺留下來的懸案，同時也就是平沼內閣中集議多决而始終未能採取確切步驟的問題。以此際國際情勢與年餘以前來比較：法國退出了國際政治舞台，英國亦較昔削弱，而德義則頗較前此增强，這都是利於日本聯合德義的因素。但日本切身的問題在太平洋，這是德義始終所絕對無能爲力的；而另一方面，環繞在日本周圍的有抗戰的中國，龐大的蘇聯，對遠東日感關切的美國，以及實力仍舊未可輕侮的英國，這些都是足以決定日本未來命運的因素；然而日本對之却只有輕侮激怒或者虛與委蛇，任何一方面的關係都不比一年以前有些許的進步。遠結鞭長草及的與國，近招四周鄰邦的反感，像這樣的外交成就，未必近衛松岡的任何前任者不優爲之，只是他們不肯付出偌大的代價而已。</p>
<p>根據三國盟的的原文，縱然相互間成就了分割世界的諒解，而德義在歐洲的戰爭以及日本在遠東的侵略，在第三國家牽涉其間以前，都只能靠自身的實力去進行，並不能立即獲得相互間的助力。這在德義方面，因其國際關係並不因締結此的而發生變動，自不遭受任何影響。而在日本，則問題絕不如此簡單：第一，遠東的綏靖政策，將從此更無運用餘地，九年來對於遠東局勢不惜縱容侵略罪行的主張，亦將無存在的可能。無形中把侵略者施行縱橫捭闔的機會爲之杜絕。第二，已往日本對英美在經濟上和物資上的依存關係，將全然斷絕，最近日方的對外貿易與國際收支狀况已陷於非常不利地位，此後必愈益悲慘。南進路綫固屬意在開闢經濟資源，但是不僅不夠代替已往的英美關係，而且還必須支出重大的代價，像越南這等不勞而獲的機會不見得再能遇到。第三，三國盟的的主要用意任牽制美國並嚇退美國，事實上所牽掣者固極有限，所施恫嚇更絕無效果，美國之於遠東只有因這一挑戰而更趨積極和嚴厲。第四，在遠東國際關係分野益趨明顯之下，中國，的抗戰自當收得道多助之效；聲稱以全力解決中國問題，此後將不能不分散其注意力和實力以應付多方面的壓迫。第五，在三國盟的中對於蘇聯關係雖有並不發生影響的規定，但這只是對於德國有利，因爲蘇德間已有不侵協定的存在；至於蘇日之間，所謂調整關係仍屬徒託空言，在已往縱有相互接近的可能，則當德義日業已當仁不讓分割歐亞之餘，蘇聯也會感到其跨越歐亞兩洲的領士將遭受新的威脅，而日方的北守南進政策此後未必竟能無所顧忌的放手做去。總之無論從任何方面觀察，都看不出日本目前的困窘地位會從這一同盟關係而獲得何等解救，另一方面，到只是增加無數新的艱難。這一前途，在日方當局並非全無感覺，唯其如此，所以近衛和松岡纔力言此舉的冒險與前途的困難，同時亦可見這一路綫也並非日當局心目中的坦途，不過其他途徑旣已堵塞無遺，則不肯懸崖勒馬的日當局，唯一的前途只有從事於最後冒險的孤注一擲。在這等情勢之下，遠東整個局面未必會發生何等變動，唯一遭受影響的只有日方自己。</p>
<h3>德國官方表示　不阻蘇聯援華　蘇報注視國際政治經濟　對三國同盟守絕對緘默</h3>
<p>柏林　德官方昨晚表示、新近成立之德·義·日三强軍事同盟、並不阻止蘇聯繼續援助中國政府、惟須以此項援助並不「積極」爲限、當記者詢及蘇聯對華軍火之輸送、是否與日本及軸心國之聯盟抵觸時、德國發言人當以美國以過期驅逐艦五十艘援英之事爲臂、渠稱、此類之軍事援助、並不被視爲與「防守」同盟之條的有關、該發言人稱、「決定之點」在於軍火援助對戰事能有何等影響、就出讓過期驅逐艦五十艘之事而言、英國僅能用此年老之驅逐艦作運輸之用、故不能認爲有助於整個戰爭局面」、德官方拒絕聲明、荷印究竟應屬於亞洲或歐洲之勢力範圍之內、據稱、「此事在三强公的中、並未提及」、論及德國對南美之態度時、德發言人稱、「德國對美洲應屬於美人之門羅主義從未反對、吾人甚願對美洲各方面、均能維持友好之關係」、（二十九日合衆社電）</p>
<p>柏林　咋日此間招待報界時、發言人稱、三國公的之主要目標，爲免使戰事之擴延、及建設世界之和平、保障各國政治社會之安寗（二十九日海通社電）</p>
<p>奠斯科　蘇聯各報、昨日對新三强軍事聯盟一事、均守絕對之緘默、惟各報競將德義日所訂協定之全文及德外長之文吿、用顯著地位登載、同時、蘇聯報紙首决公布德芬協定、該協定允許德軍假道芬蘭前往挪威北境、惟當地各報對此消息亦拒絕評論、「眞理報」等咸將社評之題目集中於國際經濟及政治之問題上、（二十九自合衆電）</p>
<p>日本力圖與蘇訂約</p>
<p>倫敦此間外交界透露、東京權威方面今日稱、日本甚盼與蘇接近、以期訂立相似於蘇·德公的之蘇·日公的、據此間所獲消息稱、日正向蘇直接建議、同時又請德國居間、此事之成否、縏乎莫斯科之態度、該項態度、現猶未能予以斷定、然聞蘇代表已與美政府會商若干時日、故此問以爲蘇聯或將利用之以與日本談判、同時駐東京外國通訊員來電稱、日軍部報紙謂、美國再予中國以援助、將被認爲挑釁之舉、三國同盟立將發勸其作用、（廿九日國　社電）</p>
<h3>日駐英大使　傳將辭職</h3>
<p>倫敦　此間昨晚得悉、日駐英大使重光葵現正考慮提出辭呈、因渠對日本與德義實行軍事同盟一事、非常反對、重光葵氏對日外務省之淸除工作、早已表示不滿、認非日本所需要者云、（二十九日合衆電）</p>

<p>特載</p>
<h3>托洛斯基之死</h3>
<p>一九四〇年八月二十日下午五時，托洛斯基剛吃罷茶，起來散步，穿過一扇門，走進花草茂盛的庭院。他在那裹踱來踱去，不時又站立着，享受那中產階級的高雅風味：一個並非依之爲生，而只是怡情悅性的花圃。盆中栽着的天竺葵已在萌芽，玫瑰長得如火如荼；雞　中羣雛喔喔，兎圈內顚蠻倒鳳，高過二十尺圍牆以上的樹枝間，小鳥迎着夕陽，嚦嚦囀鳴；濃蔭匝地，枝柯交映，小小庭院，格外顯得沉寂了。這墨西哥京城的上面，一抹晴空，遠遠地浮着幾團鬆絮般的白雲。</p>
<p>托洛斯基閒情逸致，玩賞這些景物，倒也別有會心之處。他一生在世，儘是住在叛變和革命的陰暗角落裏。現在時過境遷，艱苦的革命大業，一變而爲簡單的安閒生活。故舊寥落，門徒遠離，時相往還的只不過寥寥數人而已。他的著作，文情並茂，格調卓絕，不愧散文大家，比之他的革命理論，却要受人推崇得多多哩。</p>
<p>六十歲老翁托洛斯基，著作等身，老妻爲伴，在市郊賃屋一所，以爲亡命生涯終老之計，手頭也很寬裕，足以過着舒適整飭的生活。他向以摧殘中產階級爲能事，現在却巳成了中產階級一份子了。但他本人不甚相信有這回事。他身上老是籠罩一層革命氣息，好像從地室窖穴中透出來的一般味道，中人欲嘔。卽以他的外表而論，亦複如此。頷下蓄着一叢鬍子，好像一個江湖醫生額上亂髮蓬鬆，一望而知是個政治演說家；雙手瘦削，一刻不停的活動着；近視眼睛，倒也奕奕有光；走起路來兩肩上聳，脚步矯健敏捷，這時候，他在園子裏閒步，神情正也相仿。暗算他的人總覺得托洛斯基身上蘊藏着許多潛伏的危險。他備嘗革命家的危險，從土耳其斯坦到墨西哥，無論他到什麼地方，總是有人尾隨着。他的兒子和小輩在他被放逐的幾年中，都是死得不明不白。本年五月二十日，暴徒曾以機關槍向他寢室掃射，他眞時死裏逃生。墨西哥京城中充滿了不利於他的男女間諜。話雖如此，這時他在小院之中，總是感到很平安的吧。</p>
<p>這日下午五時半，有一位法蘭克傑克遜來訪，托洛斯基想他總不會是間諜。傑克遜在墨西哥京城中雖曾被疑爲許多化名的替身，但在托洛斯基心目中，他是一個有爲的靑年弟子，他並且還曾很慷慨的捐助第四國際。六個月之前，孟哈登一個叫做雪爾維亞阿琪洛夫的社會事業工作人員，把傑克遜介紹給托洛斯基。阿琪洛夫的妹妹一度曾做過托洛斯基的秘書。傑克遜身材高大，膚色黝黑，戴目鏡，原是南斯拉夫產，用了加拿大的護照入墨西哥境。講起英文來夾着布露克林地方口音。保衛托洛斯基的警察保鑣看見傑克遜來，問也不問的就放他進去了。</p>
<p>傑克遜此來係把文稿就正於托洛斯基。和藹可親的主人一直把他引進屋子裏。入室的時候，傑克遜走在前面，臂灣間搿着一件大衣。托洛斯基的夫人，娜太蓮雪杜佛在餐室中迎接客人，照着俄國人習慣請客人喝茶。傑克遜只要一杯水喝，左臂灣間的一件大衣也不放下來。托洛斯基和傑克遜兩人步入書室。傑克遜仍舊不把大衣拿下來。</p>
<p>書室中陳飾十分簡單，地板上也不舖地毯。四壁作奶油色，除了一張墨西哥大地圖外，他無所有。中央放着一張大木桌，上面亂堆着些書本紙張文稿之類。托洛斯基就坐了下來，閱讀客人所帶來的文稿。傑克遜斜俯着他的肩胛。在大衣下面，他早就夾帶藏着一枝手槍，一把匕首和一柄尖嘴鋤，他所選用的是這最後一種「重」武器。如果一記斫下去而成功的話，就可在不聲不響之中，結果了這老頭兒的性命了。</p>
<p>但是傑克遜手脚並不敏捷。正和托洛斯基一般，他也是慣住在謀叛的陰暗世界中，對於某種事所見不廣。要是換上農夫或工人，他們就知道如果要一下子結果人家的性命，那沒第一擊必須用盡生平之力，始不賁事。尖嘴鋤本來就很鋒利，一記斫下去，早把托洛斯基的腦壳砸碎，所惜氣力還用得不足。托洛斯基並不跌倒，連他自己已經被斫也不知道。他只覺得自己身上中了一槍，就從椅子中直跳起來，緊抓着兇手不放，並且緊緊的咬住他的手。年靑的傑克遜雖然具有短刀，手槍，和尖嘴鋤三種武器，一時惶亂起來竟也想不出怎樣來對付這老頭兒。托洛斯基大聲呼喊，搖抖着身子，蹣跚挨入餐室。忠勇的托夫人在門口攔阻傑克遜，一撲而上，把他絆住。保鏢柯柏和漢森也聞警前來。柯柏把兇手用棍擊倒於地，向他的頭部和身上亂踢。漢森扶着托洛斯基使他平臥於地。托洛斯基碎腦壳中血流如注，他對漢森說道：「不要弄死他。這個人還有話要說呢。」</p>
<p>歷史家的托洛斯基雖則性命巳如懸絲，他還想到他臨終的情形一定要傳之後世的。娜太蓮把身子翼掩在她丈夫的身上，托洛斯基用手指着他的心口道：「我在這里覺得，這一决他們成功了。」</p>
<p>托洛斯基腦壳破裂，髓液外流，左半身已開始麻木，神智却還淸醒。在急救醫院中，他很淸楚的對漢森口述道：我在室中受政治暗殺的狙擊，命在俄傾。我曾和兇手搏鬭。他入室之後，口稱要討論法蘭西的統計。他就斫我。請寄語我們的朋友：我對於第四國際的勝利毫無疑義。大家前進！</p>
<p>遇害後二十五小時又三十分鐘，托洛斯基以倔强的本性和生命掙扎，彷彿他在十七歲時開始革命工作，直到眼前爲止一樣。進醫院後頭腦曾經兩次用手術，兇手也在同一醫院中療傷。妻子守護着他，寸步不離。如果一個人在彌留之際，尙能回溯已往的事情，那沒在托洛斯基昏沉沉的頭腦中，一定有下面的各種印象，重映在腦膜上面。那是：九歲的布龍司丁（托洛斯基之本姓）從寇森鄉下出來到哇第薩讀書……受馬克思主義薰陶……一八九八年初决在莫斯科入獄……娶亞立山大，洛伏納……一九〇〇年放逐至西比利亞……一九〇二年以假名「托洛斯基」亡英……與列寗相會於倫敦……其間第一與第二國際，先後在倫敦與巴黎成立……一九〇五年俄國革命失敗再流亡西比利亞……逃亡至歐洲……一九一七年三月革命後返俄，與列寗相會，幫助十月革侖計劃……改組紅軍的豐功偉績……驅逐白俄出境……成立第三及第四國際……流亡至土耳其斯坦……法蘭西……挪威……墨西哥……謀叛……著作……」</p>
<p>托洛斯基之死，除了莫斯科一班老伙伴以外，大家總覺得可怕。因爲多數人都忘懷了他本人就是一個恐怕份子。托洛斯基致死之道，旁人雖不得而知，但有些人却疑心他行將殺靑的「史太林傳」中，或有開罪於人的地方。究竟如何，別人也無從揣測。這部書的原稿半部已經譯成英文，現存紐約；其餘半部未經整理及翻譯，存墨西哥京城。出版道書的書商尙不知何時始能付印。</p>
<p>若以著作家來看托洛斯基，「史太林傳」的寫作在他文名中將無所輕重。他不朽之作是那三巨秩的「俄國革命始末」。他是社會革命的鼓動者，組織者，和指導者，以文人而兼實行家，托洛斯基將爲世人所難忘的一個。</p>
<p>列寗撤手西歸之時，托洛斯基曾忽促口傳十三字云：「列寗死矣。消息之來如巨石　海。」托洛斯基臨終之時，無人爲誌一言，未免可惜。（譯Time週報）</p>

<h3>減低存息與今後投機</h3>
<p>— 章榴</p>
<p>前幾天在報上看到浙江實業銀行减低存款的新聞，其額减辦法，爲十月一日對活期存額，减息一厘。接着又見報載鹽業，金城，中南，大陸與四行儲蓄會，對於活期以及往來存額，不論在商業部及儲蓄部或信託部者，一律遞减一厘。我們不知道過去這幾家銀行對於存款利率，有沒有提高過；然而有一點自可以知道則在最近，銀行界已經感到資金運用日見困難，而不能不從减息身上來减輕自己的担負了。這實在是說明上海工商金融的最近趨向，是値得加以注意。</p>
<p>對於活期存款的應否給予利息問題，一般的銀行學者意見，依據各國習慣，主張不予利息，因爲手續較繁，而存款又求許長期運用。但在我國，則活期存款向來都有利息，不過利率大致較定期爲低。此其理由，或者是因爲我國的存款利息，一般的都比較各國爲高，所以活存也不能不付以利息。</p>
<p>存款利率的高低，向由各銀行自己斟酌規定，大致需要存款較切者，不能不將利率比較提高。。而不需要存款者，不妨將利率比較减低。然而在另一方面，在存款利率的高低上，實可以看到該國獲得生產資金的狀况，存款利息較高，其放款的利息也必跟之而提高，也卽生產界要獲得資金，必須負担較大的利息。反之，存款利息低微，生產界獲得資金較易，其利息的担負也輕，事業目然容易發展。我國生產落後，農村未脫封建社會，故依然有高利貸情形存在。至於在城市與都市中，則因銀行事業的發達，獲得資金較易，所以其利率比內地爲低，上海的存款利息，在全國可以說是比較低廉之區，但跟同地的洋商銀行相比較，則仍覺高昂。國人事業之獲得資金，其負担仍較洋商爲重，因此减低存款利息一事，對生產發展方面說起來，是非常有利的。</p>
<p>因爲利率的高低，有調節生產資金的作用，照利率政策，也爲國家金融政策中的主要課題之一。一般地說，在金融緊張的時候，可以用　高利率的方法，來保留資金的流出，而在金融鬆弛的時候，則用減低利率的方法，使產業資金的周轉，益形活潑。此外對於產價的調節，在理論上也具有相當作用，因爲利率旣是生產失業的直接負担，也即商品成本負担之一，所以利率的高低，就直接可以影響到物價。</p>
<p>這一次上海各銀行的減低存款利率，在動機上究竟是爲什么？減低後對於今日之上海將生怎樣的反應？這裏試爲一簡單的探討。</p>
<h3>借了債投機的怪現象</h3>
<p>「游資增多這句話已爲上海人一般所通曉的口頭禪，然游資的增多，實在說明上海的資金市場的戰時情形。上海爲什麼會感覺游資過多？如果游資眞的過多，那末爲什麼在最近半年來，我們往來息反會有激劇的上漲呢？可見游資過多，這是事實，生產界並不因了游資的過多，而獲得較容易的資金，這也是事實。</p>
<p>八一三戰事發生後，上海並不感覺游資的過多，因了一般工商業的萎落，反使銀行界對蓄積的資金，無法　用。翌年三月，外匯暗市塲發生後，資金逃避日形公開，逃避的數字也日以加鉅。內地的資金，因了貿易入超，紛紛滙滬，又因上海投機事業的發達，資金向外逃避也格外增劇。因此，全國資金的流動，差不多是以上海爲中心而集中，而上海的資金，則集中於資金的逃避。其允著者爲外匯的套利。所設外匯套利，是直截將資金儘先扒購外滙的一種勾當，於國計民生毫無好處。扒購外匯的人，其資金旣非自己所有，因爲急於獲得抵償欠款，願意担負較高的利息，此項利息，卽爲外滙套利的來源，其額每月常達四分之鉅，也即爲週息四分八厘。正規的銀行家是吾以肚項套利等的營業，我們不能知道，但所謂　般新設的銀號，以及企業公司等，則集體於套匯的投資，實己極爲公開。資金這個東西，有些像流水，水是往低處走，而資金自然往有利處走。有了這們一個好去處，存戶的利率就無形中提高起來，每個人都願意借債來做投機，這是造成上海戰後金利高漲之一因。</p>
<p>在工商界方面呢，他們也願意負担較高的利息，來從事生產的擴充。跟着外匯暗市的波動，物價也隨之而騰漲。每一家工廠只要多存一些原料，其所得利潤，往往會超過其整年熟貨出售之所得。生產界因之物價的上升，獲得了鉅額的利潤，一方面大量購存原料，一方面大量擴大製造，因爲其利潤較厚，所以也願意負担較高之利率。這也是無形中造成上海戰後金利高漲情形之一。</p>
<p>因爲資金逃避的加重，投機的亢進，種種反應，所以每一工商業者固然需要資金，每一投機家也需要資金，同時，正規的金融業者，爲防止資金的流出，以及營業的擴大，也需要資金。我們所看銀號與錢兌莊風起雲湧的設立，他們就是吸收資金的組合。在這種狀態下，一般資金的利率自然是向上昇的。</p>
<p>遠見的學者們看到道種現象，認爲是游資的作崇，所以提出「到西南去」的口號，但至今沒有成就，這原因自然是很多，一種是因爲內地的生產設備，未能跟資金調整互相配合，一種就是因爲在上海的利率收穫，遠在一般的投資以上。</p>
<h3>進舊墳墓還是找生活</h3>
<p>現在上海銀行界是提出了减低存息的事實了。依過去不合理的高利貸情形論，那些，减低存　自然是一件可喜的現象。但利率减低之後，是不是表示今後的游資，將趨向正規道上；而正規的工商業者，因此可以獲得低資金的周轉呢？</p>
<p>不，與其從减低存息來推述其後果，還毋寗是來探究它的原動力較爲適當。我們第一要指出的，今日上海的减低存息，絕非表示金戀界的趨向合理化，乃單純表示這是上海「景氣」的下落，這些游資，過去逞雄於投機市塲中的，現在是閒散起來了。</p>
<p>最大的原因，是外匯暗市塲的長期安定，本年六月中旬以後，外滙暗市塲從緊張的狀態中圓復過來，巨大的資金回歸，使扒購外滙的人，不能獲得什麼好處。對美的滙兌，曾從每百元對美四元餘，長到六元以外，許多投機家在這决風潮中都失敗了。所謂套利的勾當，也因了投機的减退，而至沒有利益可得。資金的最大去處旣已杜塞，過去逃出的資金又重新回歸到銀行錢莊手中去，銀行錢莊的存額自然只有壅積起來了。</p>
<p>因了滙市的鬆動，又影響到商品市塲，主要的商品如棉紗等，也幾乎跌價到百分之五十，商品一跌價，固然影響了工廠的生產，又因西南緬甸越南各路的封鎖，使工商業的活動範圍遂漸縮小，對於資金的需要，與過去多多益善的情形，也顯有不同。</p>
<p>這兩點情形，正是表示整個上海市塲的演化。依一般景氣的學理言，在景氣上昇期中，工業活潑，金利高昂，物價高漲，其下落期中則反是，因通貨價値貶低而發生的景氣，其情形也相似。法幣的外匯暗示，固然絕非表示通貨貶値，川因外滙暗市貶低而發生的特殊景氣，則與貶値時所發生的景氣相類似。而今日所感到的一切現象，芷與通貨緊縮的後果相類似，而减低存息卽爲此種指標之一。</p>
<p>此種存息的低减，可以影響到放款利息的低减，但此種低减，不會使工商界感到什麼實惠，因爲工商界的整個活動機構也是在停滯狀態中。在上海更說不到。</p>
<p>但這並不說明整個資金市塲前途的悲觀，以爲資金眞的找不到歸宿。我們以爲上海在今日情形是特殊的，而銀行家更應該覺悟到過去運用資金方法的非是。十年以前，我們批評中國銀行界的投資目標，是外滙，公債與房地產。五年以前，房地產與外滙的項目逐漸消失，但十年以後的今日，銀行界的授資目標，不覺又回復舊日的墳墓中去了！銀行事業繁榮的基礎，目然是依靠在生產事業身上，把握了這一點在减低存息之後，應當怎樣地來投資，這或許是大家都明瞭的吧。</p>
<h3>日本資源的槪况</h3>
<p>— 嚴懋德</p>
<p>誰都知道的，日本是個先天不足，各項資源異常貧乏的國家，但是現代的戰爭，是巨量物質的消耗戰，設沒有豐富的資源，戰事是無法賡續的。</p>
<p>在中日戰爭匕經過了三十七個月的現在，日本資源狀况如何？這對於戰爭前途估量上，無疑的是極爲重要。况且最近美國又實旅禁運油鐵與日本，自予日本以重大的影響，因此我們對於日本資源狀况，有加以檢討的必要。</p>
<p>我們爲叙述方便起見，將日本資源，分爲金屬資源，動力資濟，糧食資源，化學資源，織維資源等五方面來說：</p>
<p>金屬資源：日本所領有的金屬資源，可以說異常貧乏，尤且是非常重要的資源—生鐵，日本偏是特別缺乏。據日本地質學會調查，日本鐵礦埋藏量計一萬萬零一百九十五萬噸，含鐵量四千零三十二萬噸，朝鮮的埋藏量則在一午萬頓左右，又據萬國地質學會的估計，日本鐵礦的埋藏量，只有五千六百萬噸，其中含鐵量只有一千八百萬噸。</p>
<p>以上兩種估計的差額，顯然是　入的·但縱使我們承認前者是可靠，也依然不足供應國內的消耗。因爲在一九三六年而論，日本的鐵的用額爲四百萬噸，其中採取日本內地和朝鮮的，的有百萬噸，其餘三百萬噸，完全依靠中國，馬來半島，菲律濱及澳洲方面輸入的。在去年九月間，日本宣布禁止鋼鐵售於私人，顯示其戰時鋼鐵生產問題的嚴重。現在美國又實施禁運廢鐵與日本，勢必增加日本鋼鐵恐慌程度，則其在戰爭前途上將成爲　端嚴重的問題。</p>
<p>至於其他輕金屬，日本卽大感缺乏。雖然銅的埋藏量（約一萬五千萬噸和產量相當的多，但仍須輸入不少，每年的有白分之五十二，是由美國輸入的。工業上所需要的鋁和錫，每年也有百分之九十和百分之七十購自國外。鋁的自給力只有十分之一，亞鉛二分之，鎳差不多完全不能自給；此外軍需必要品的合金材料如錳，銻，鎢，鋅，鈷，鎘，鉻，等，日本當然也是非常缺乏的。</p>
<p>動力資源；日本煤的埋藏量當然不及美蘇德英和中國等，但倒還差强人意。據調查所得，在日本內地藏煤量約六十二萬八千萬公噸，在朝鮮，南庫頁島，台灣等地的有十九萬丸千五百萬公噸，合計八十二萬七千餘萬公噸。最近的產額，大的年達叫千萬公噸左右，百分之九十可以自給。不過我們須注意的，就是日本煤產多爲瀝靑煤揮發的成分太多，不能獲得良好的骸炭（卽所謂焦煤）。所以製造治金以及製鐵業用的焦煤，幾乎完全缺乏，誠如日本著名敎授犬上的調查日本可供工業需用的煤，祇達百分之十五，而製造軍需品的五金工業所用的焦煤，大部分依靠外來的輸入的。</p>
<p>動力資源中更重要的還有煤油。日本煤油消費額年約四千萬噸，實際自給能力僅四百萬噸，卽不足數量達百分之九十，全賴美國等輸入，但美國實施禁運油類與日本後，勢必成爲日本資源中最大的一個問題。現貯藏量達如何程度，不得而知，但戰時延長，無論如何是不能持久的。何况日本爲購買煤油而向海外流出的金額達一萬七千二百萬元。如果日本煤油一旦吿竭，則匪特其國內汽車不能開動，抑且連侵略工具—飛機，和坦克車等，也只能在戰塲作爲陳列品公開展覽會了。</p>
<p>糧食資源：日本人民主要的食品是米（的佔百分之六十）麥，大豆，魚類，內類，甘薯及其他雜糧。可見米爲日本基本的食糧。而近十年中，日本本土食米生產，每年的爲六千五百萬石左右，消費的須七千五百萬石左右，每年約不足一千萬石；不足之數，均由朝鮮及台灣兩殖民地輸入補充。惟本年（一九三九—一九四〇）朝鮮亦感覺同樣的米荒，其勢不能再供給日本，於是造成了日本糧食的供給上極大的恐慌。至於小麥一項，日本年需三百萬噸，自給能力爲百分之四十，其不足額大部分依賴澳洲及加拿大。我們知道，日本是一個以農立國的國家，百分之四十八的人民係屬耕農階級。自中日戰事發生後，農民旣多被徵發，造成了今日日本人工的不足，工資的昂貴，而且肥料的產量又大大低落，耕作一定要受大大的影響，糧食恐慌將會越發加强。然粗食自給爲一個國家經濟上最大的資源，否則將大賴於國外的供給。况日本每年食料輸入總値，已達二萬萬元至一萬萬元左右。若常此以往，勢必對於經濟方面發生嚴重影響，淮而引起社會極大的不安。</p>
<p>化學資源：化學資源不僅在一般工業用途上很重要，而劉於製造穴藥毒氣等允屬不可缺少。日本雖擁有大量的硫黃，可是對於化學藥品如工業鹽，樹膠，酒精，燐石，蘇打，肥田粉等皆不足供應戰時所需，以工業　一項說，日本年需工業鹽約一百餘萬噸，百分之八十左右須依靠輸入，其中從意屬索謀利蘭來的最多，其决則爲埃及，關東州等。此外蘇打，酒精却異常缺乏，每年的需輸人十五萬噸，因此每年輸入的料値達一千五百餘萬元。</p>
<p>纖　資源：纖維資源在事需上直接間接也有很密切的關係，但主要纖維資源如棉花，羊毛，木漿，麻等項，日本多感缺乏，甚至有百分之九十以上非依賴輸入不可。棉花，日本國內差不多毫無出產，全賴美國，印度，中國埃及等地輸入。羊毛則從澳洲，新西蘭等地輸入。木漿則從美國，挪威，芬蘭等地輸入。（按木漿每年消費量達八八二〇〇〇公噸，日本國內及滿洲所產只有六〇〇〇〇公噸，此原料大部份供給造紙。）纖維資源引起恐慌時，匪特可摧毀日本輕工業的基礎，抑且對於製造軍需工業也有莫大的影響。</p>
<p>此外如橡皮年需五千餘萬元，其中百分之四七從海峽殖民地輸入，百分之二十三從荷屬甫印度輸人。皮革工業的原料，日本內地及朝鮮，台灣，樺太都缺乏異常，每年需要額約三千萬斤，其中二千萬斤須依賴輸入，由中國滿洲，美國及南美諸國所供給。</p>
<p>總之，日本在各種資源中最感困難者爲纖維工業中的棉花羊毛及軍需工業中的煤油鐵礦，這些資源是日本國民經濟的生命素，來源减少或斷絕，必然使日本無法賡續作戰。最近，美國已實旅禁運油鐵與日本，則予日本戰爭產業以更重大的影響。所以在日本賡　作戰而消耗的條件下，日本的崩潰或覆滅是經濟上的必然性，這可以斷言的。</p>

<h3>金融述評</h3>
<p>— 聖凱瓊</p>
<p>—九月廿八日—</p>
<p>若是美國是求法幣匯價的穩定，以發展中美間的貿易，那宋這二千五百萬美金勢必劃到外匯平準基金賬中去，美國方面必須參加基金的運川，以控制黑市塲投機者的活動而穩法幣匯價。中美間是不是會因此而發展到合作穩定法幣的途徑上去，正難預料，但是美國果眞希望中國抗戰以牽制日本在南太平洋上的行動，則在金融上的合作，我們正未可說是因供給外匯上需要的二千五百萬美元而起的幻想。</p>
<p>在事實上無論如何，中美新借款的成立，對於外滙投機者是一重大的打擊。不管是用以穩定法幣黑匯市塲乃是投機者的當頭棒喝，卽是用在自由中國的抗戰經濟建設，因爲中國戰時的經濟力量愈强，法幣的基礎愈固，法幣的價値亦愈强，則希望法幣價値不利的發展的外匯投機者，勢必受到挫折，這是無待贅言的。</p>
<p>據說上海的銀行業中有兩家大商業銀行，因爲運用維艱厚自準備的理由，不願抱耗存款利息，將活期存款利息减低，定於十月一日起實行。記得戰前中國政府方面希望銀行業减低利率以振興工商業，而銀行業方面正面上却希望政府領導實行，背面上則嚴肅地的說銀行業因爲成本關係，收進來的存款利率高，放款利率不得不大，若要减低放款利率，還得先减低存款利率。這暗中便是向政府表示若政府有法减低存款利率，銀行放款利率自然减低。中國是個高利貸國家，於是减息也者祇是說說罷了。不料中日三年戰爭之後，上海的兩家大商業銀行並不在政府領導之下，自動的减低存息！</p>
<p>在此時此地銀行業减低存息對於抗戰經濟究將有何反響，姑留置不加討論。不過在作者直覺上認爲上海的銀行業，與其僅有消極的舉措，斤斤於一行的利益損失間題上打算，何如認淸時代積極地去計謀一些對於國家有利的貢獻呢，要知道消極的舉措，破壞的成分居多，而積極的設施，建設的成分居多。作者用以「减息與資金內移」責之於上海的銀行業。</p>
<p>上海的銀行業中　明的銀行家，在戰期中對於國家戰時金融不是沒有供獻，如安定金融的補充辦法，如滙劃制度的加强運用等。在道抗戰三年之後，銀行家允應奮發努力爲國，在緊接减息之後，迅速圖謀資金的內移。上海活期存款的運用途徑本來是由銀行業在投機市塲上運用，或由存款者直接在投機，本來並不注意於存款的年利率爲三厘　厘，而在祈求投機利益的爲倍數，爲十分數，爲最低限度的百分數。現在銀行突然减低一厘，愈加使投機者認爲存款利益何如投機利益，而本不投機的活期存款者，亦有何不從事投機以謀生利之意念。所以若沒有方法吸收這些資金使之內移，投資於有關抗戰的經濟建設，勢必擴大投機的風尙，而泯滅投資的觀念。</p>
<p>自由中國內正在努力於節約建國儲蓄運動，這决繼起减息的某商業銀行香港分行亦號售儲蓄券，在上海方面雖因環境關係不能發售，但是作者認爲可以變動辦法，創造各種名目的投資儲蓄，如投資輕工業儲蓄，投資重工業儲蓄等，銀行收進此項資金後，卽匯入內地認購節的建國儲蓄券，或組織各種投資集團，以求資金的內移。不過前者方法較之後者方法要好，因爲節儲券是由國家償付本息，有利無損；而組織投資樊團時，則有利有損，不能保險有利。</p>
<p>希望上海的賢明的銀行家，擬具一種辦法，努力實行，俾在减息之後，繼以吸收資金的工作。　（完）</p>

<h3>德義日同盟後　上海方面之反應</h3>
<p>德義日三國軍事經濟同盟，今乃竟行實現，政府對此，採取如何立塲，雖尙未有正式聲明，但據一般人士觀察，德義日之聯盟，醞釀已久，不過至今而始實現。此舉所蒙其影響者，與其謂爲對中國，無寗謂爲對英美。中國反以英美之加强援助，而戰事得以益臻堅强，此可斷言也。茲將著名評論家伍德海氏暨外籍觀察家之意見，分述如决</p>
<p>伍德海評論　美政策堅强</p>
<p>著名評論家伍德海氏，咋在英文大美晚報上，對於一週來之世界時事，作一總合之簡評。其中關於遠東部份略稱，法日兩方，雖在河內訂定准許日軍在越南登陸之協定，但華南日軍司令安藤，似已決心視越南爲敵對之領土。渠於德古西原二氏簽署協定後數小時之內，卽加以破壞，並在日本所提最後通牒時限尙未屆滿之前，不顧西原使日軍行動限於協定範圍內之努力，竟繼續進行軍車行動，佔領諒山，轟炸海防，並對廣西東京邊界之法界，迭加襲擊。凡此種種，造成河內協定之顯被破壞。</p>
<p>同時美國方面，已由例行之抗議，而進至公開之實際行動，以巨額貸款協助中國外匯之需要，並將於十月中旬，對日實旅禁運廢鐵。美海軍部對於借用新加坡根據地之問題，仍在討論中。尙有其他辦法，均足以表示美國對日本破壞遠東現狀之行動，深爲不悅。</p>
<p>至於所謂德義日「防守」同盟一事，吾人對之，實無震驚之必要，其實此乃里賓特洛甫與齊亞諾一種故意假仁假義之代表作。數月來，日本若果參戰，其必站於軸心國家一方，此爲顯而易見之事實，所謂一同盟」也者，其實正何必多此一舉也。同盟協定中有一條規定「倘簽字國之一，遭遇歐洲戰爭或中日戰爭目前尙未牽涉之國家之攻擊，三國當在政治經濟軍事三方面互相援助。」</p>
<p>此一條文之規定，顯爲針對美國而發，但所稱「攻擊」詞，並米定下界說。查德國曾自稱受挪威，荷蘭，比利時與丹麥之「攻擊」，而今日本亦正不妨依樣畫葫蘆，而自稱受越南之「攻擊」也。無論如何，此一同盟，劉於美國遠柬政策之轉趨强硬，決不致有絲毫影響也。</p>
<p>外籍觀察家　談美國援華</p>
<p>平明社記者昨亦以此德義日同盟事，叩詢外籍國際觀察家，據其表示意見如下。</p>
<p>英國初以有事於歐，無暇東顧，雖日本乘隙橫逼，忍無可忍，一惟懷柔政策，自甘退步，天津白銀問題，甫告簽字，而香港之封鎖，繼之而起。同時以滇緬公路禁運相要挾，蓋以一個自主國家，遇此無理要求，當無曲從之義務，然又爲避免爭端，亦惟俯首聽命，暫行禁運三月，以此一再忍受，終不免於德義日之同盟，而處於敵對，則此後之非援華以制日，對於遠東前所已得之權益，殊非爲央所有矣。故在滇緬路之禁運，自可無待期滿而予以開放。</p>
<p>至於美國，雖素重公道，與中國友誼甚深，其不直侵略國家，恣意橫行，以破壞世界和平，觀於毅然廢止美日商的，禁止廢鐵運日，正對英之對日讓步，而與日以最大打擊，已可窺見其端倪。明知遠東侵略者撕毀九國公的，大展魔手，太平洋安全，勢將難以避免，自知一己軍力，不足與敵，且爲期未必如此之促，故對內則極力準備，對外則聯絡與國，知中國之必能拖住日本泥足，故不時加以精神下之援助。今以德義日同盟旣成，再進一步，禍必及己，倘非積極援華，日後侵略者勢必更張，而有難以抑止之勢。故其於越南允日假道之後，卽貸鉅款於中國。今德義日又復同盟，則此後物質之援助，恐尙不止此而止，此可推想而知。</p>

<p>衣食住行</p>
<h3>衣食住行應守的規律</h3>
<p>— 秋郎</p>
<p>在這非常時期，尤其是薪給階級，維持這「衣食住行」四大要素，的確非容易的事！所以我們對這四大要素，旣要從儉，更應守規律，在人我接觸之間，律已應嚴，與人以寬，重醴貌，主謙和，非敢以道學語來勸勉羣衆，但至少能够避免不少糾紛吧。</p>
<p>衣：我們處此艱苦時代，應該提倡穿著舊衣，穿舊衣並不是可恥的事，但求常時洗滌淸潔，摺疊整齊，鞋帽常時刷去塵埃，在穿衣戴帽的時候，帽要戴正，衣上鈕扣亦須扣齊，對於子女允應囑其照辦，因嘗見本人雖衣冠端正，而於家人子女則忽略不顧，這也容易使人輕視而被人批評的。</p>
<p>食：社會酬酢，戚友慶弔，在筵宴之間，舉箸時總以謙遜爲宜，飲酒至多八分爲度，切不可太貪，狼吞虎咽，吃得酩酊大醉！主人固然不便發言，但使同座之客，大爲厭惡！而於本人飲食過度，也是無益有損的，便是日常會食，吃菜先素後葷，不可舉箸亂攬，亦不宜吃兼人之食，在同事間免使人感到不快，在家庭內，可爲家人的表率。</p>
<p>住：說到住，在這房價飛漲的時候，一幢屋子住上幾家，是極普通的事，可是爲經濟而合住，最要的彼此謙和爲第一！各家都應存着，吃虧就是便宜之心，寗願讓人一步，自然相安無事，但是同居起糾紛的，着實不少，都因彼此不能相諒，隨成爭執，也有因小孩們頑皮，致引起事端的，那末全仗做大人的，譴責自己的孩子，使對方認爲合理，爭端也就平息了。</p>
<p>行：人生兩足，它的效能本來是行路的，常走路的人，可使血脈流通，筋骨强健，旣屬節省經濟，叉合衛生之道，但是性瀨的人，出門必須以車代步，不肯勞動爲尊，須知處此時期，我們正應勤苦耐勞，走些路算得什麼！但是路途較遠，或遇急迫要事，那非借重車子，代步不可，也應乘坐較廉的公共汽車，電車，並且在上車落車時候，還須先讓婦孺在前，車中座位擁擠時，亦讓若輩先坐，這是我們在情理上應該做到的。</p>
<h3>兒童服裝的要點</h3>
<p>— 雲霖</p>
<p>兒童的服裝，影響於它們的健康甚鉅，茲將必須注意的各點列舉於後，以供各家長之參考。</p>
<p>（甲）衣服的質料：（一）要柔軟，（二）要富有吸收性，（三）要光滑而不刺激皮膚，（四）要便於洗滌。</p>
<p>（乙）衣服的色澤：衣服攝取外界的溫度，是因色而異的。有色的較白色的攝取量爲大，並且在衣服的染料中，有許多是含有刺激性的色素，如銻，砒，鉛，銅，水銀，鋅和安尼林等。此種顏料倘附着在身體上，有時會使兒童嫩弱的皮膚發炎的。</p>
<p>（丙）衣服的式樣，兒童的身體，因發育未健全，各部都顯得非常軟弱，所以一切尺寸式樣宜寬闊而不宜過緊。</p>
<p>（丁）皮膚分泌是把體內廢物排洩出來，所以衣服宜富有吸收性，以吸取汚液，不致存積在身體上。</p>
<h3>午飯之商榷</h3>
<p>— 鄭逸梅</p>
<p>吃飯問題，是誰都重視，母怪昔人有一民以食爲天」的呼聲了。我們平常生活，大都每日三餐。就是早晨進些點心，午時及旁晚吃兩頓飯。鄙人對於午飯，却有小小的商榷處，認爲午時宜進點心，早晨不妨吃飯，這是什麼理由？容鄙人說明在下面吧。</p>
<p>子輿氏不是有：「　飱而治」這句話嗎？注：「熟食也。朝曰　，夕曰飱」，可見古人原於早晨進飯，吾則何以祇提着朝和夕，沒有說着午呢，至今我人仍沿着這個習慣，早晨所進的稱爲早飯，一般鄉下人，竟有早上眞個起身就吃飯，不過他們五時和旁晚再吃着飯罷了。記得鄙人某年到蘇州鄉下黎里去吃喜酒，在那兒盤桓了好多天，他們早上進點心，稱爲早飯，午飯反稱爲點心。第一天，他們備了午飯，傭僕却來請鄙人去吃點心。鄙人不知所以，就回覆說點心已吃過，傭僕笑了起來，說這裏所說的點心，便是午飯。鄙人才恍然大悟，也不覺爲之失笑。由此可知午時進點心，早上吃飯，定必由來已久，後來乃徒存其名，不求實際罷哩。若眞能早上吃飯，那麼家家戶戶，不期然而然的自能遵行朱柏廬「黎明卽起」的信條，買菜的買菜，煮飯的煮飯。果了腹，才去從公辦事，到了午時，祇娘備些麵包或餅乾，不到十分鐘，一頓中餐，就此解決，那不是時間經濟了不少，工作效力上增加了許多成績嗎？且高級的職員，如經理大班，行長買辦等，母須於正午時駕着摩托卡返邸，吃了飯，又駕着摩托卡來視事，汽油每月可省若干加倫。一人如此，推之一地一國，這總數一定很足驚人，物力財力人力節省了，於抗建上不是很有裨益嗎？那些中下職員，屆時不必到外面去找小飯店或小館子吃經濟苦飯，天雨下雪，更不必跋涉維艱了。卽以時間支配而論，假定旁晚六時吃飯，到明天早上七時，屈指計算，凡十三小時。經此很長的時間，腹中空空如也，自富結結實實的吃一頓飯，較爲適當。若早上進了點心，正午十二時吃飯，旁晚六時吃夜飯，從十二時至六時，僅六個小時，倒吃兩頓飯，就未免太不均勻了。有人說，早上起身就吃飯，往往吃不下去，這怎樣辦呢？鄙人却以爲這是不習慣所致，如能行之有素，那麼習慣而成自然，便沒有什麼困難了。鄙人認爲道個問題，比夏令的撥快鐘點，允爲切實，且不限季節，四時可以通行的。</p>
<h3>行路難</h3>
<p>— 遂眞</p>
<p>衣食住行，爲人生四大要素，現在除衣食住三項已遭受了嚴重的威脅不計外，而「行」的一項，最近又發生了最大的麻煩，觀乎最近的電車和公共汽車工友罷工，卽是一例。從大體方面說，各有立塲，未可厚非。惟我輩薪水層中人，幾乎無日不與電車或公共汽車相接觸，自經相繼罷工以來，黑牌汽車一向絕緣，營業汽車，也和不起，一决的代價，也需三四元，在下一日之間勞心勞力所得報酬不過爾爾，故更不敢作此妄想。那麼耍穩快價廉，兼而有之，只有請敎人力車了。可是說也慚愧，這幾日一班車夫氣熖之高漲，竟凌駕我輩之上，索價之昂，態度之硬，正與「八一三」時，由南市喬遷到租界相彷彿，這眞叫人膛日不知所對。但赴寫字間時間是固定的，遲到就須受扣薪等類切膚之痛，情急智生，說不得有勞一下畢生相依爲命的一雙尊腿了。雖然這十一號的汽車不足與八隻汽缸轎車相媲美；可是路是須要人走的，下決心的走，認定了方向，終有一個時間使你到達，人生之途和學問事業的成功，端不外乎此例，語云：精誠所至，金石爲開，這比之行路，未免過於誇大，如形容筆者或一般人當時的心境，却並不過份。恰巧這一天的早晨，正下着毛毛雨，柏油路上分外的滑，從康腦脫路步行到江西路，足足地要一小時，眞有平劇唱詞中「快馬加鞭一夜還」之概，氣急敗壞地僥倖趕到，回顧長衫的邊緣，已滿沾泥漿，渾身是汗，喘氣未蘇，便開始服務，其他也不暇計及。直忙到人的黃昏的時候，才蹣跚脚步，重賦歸來，眼看路上的行人，雖不似往日熙熙攘攘的盛况，而×××戲院和××飯店門口的各式自備汽車，仍排得一字長蛇陣似的威風凜凜，煞是好看。心想他們或伊們可以得到物質上最高的一切享受，相形見絀，他們眞可算是天之驕子了。正在邊走邊想的踱着慢步，不料後面來了一輛流綫型的轎車，風馳電掣般過去，一個避讓不及，濺了半身的泥水，仔細看時，車已去遠，隱的從車牕中還伸出一個狗頭來，這不消說定是車主人所養的一匹×××種愛犬了。心中憤憤，同時更覺得兩條腿有些酸痛，於是埋頭前進，一直捱到家中，已經是筋疲力盡，忙去汚衣，倒身便睡。</p>
<p>夜色籠罩了大地，樓上的Radio和樓下的脾聲，震耳欲聾，加之窗外的蕭蕭秋雨，夾雜着幾陣寒潮，萬種愁腸，一時叢集，腦海中思潮起伏，竟無催眠術，順手尋了本唐詩消遣，翻了幾頁，却讀到了一首蜀道難古詩，不禁廢然拋書，深深地嘆了一聲行路難。</p>
<h3>廢物利用</h3>
<p>— 建華</p>
<p>讀上月二十六日本刋的自芳君的「舊襪利用法」以后，據作者所知，除了自芳君所道者以外，還有幾種利用法，一併寫在下面：</p>
<p>（一）做紮底錢：依照自芳君的方法搓成紥底綫，用以紮布底鞋的鞋底，經濟而耐用。</p>
<p>（二）做套袖：將破舊的襪子剪去下半截（卽襪底及小統處），在剪斷處縫上貼邊，套在小孩的衣袖。上做套袖，可免衣袖受汚。</p>
<p>（二）做褲帶：將女子穿的長統破襪，截去襪底，祇剩兩隻襪統，用針縫接起來，用作褲帶，柔軟而舒適。</p>
<p>其他，舊襪子還可用來包紥創口，通風舒服，適合衛生。凡此種種，皆是非常時期的經濟之道。</p>

<h3>論消弭工潮</h3>
<p>— 蕭亢石</p>
<p>加薪不足消弭將來之工潮　制裁投機囤積乃治本之法</p>
<p>溯事變以還，三年有餘，百物飛漲，數倍於戰前，而上海之百物，在在仰給於他地，故其物價之高昂，固爲意料中事。何奈鄉僻小鎭，其菜蔬之昂，與上海比較，竟亦相差無幾。蓋今日非局部之遭刦，無處不在苦難之境中掙扎，而期待重賭光明也。是以在上海謀生之職工，其家屬不論居滬居鄉，以數十元之薪水，欲維持全家之生活者幾希？卽如近來之工潮，一若蔓草之滋長不已，究其因，要亦爲高貴生活之壓榨而釀成者也！</p>
<p>是以衆論將合理之加薪，爲消弭今日工潮之唯一良法，蓋工人求得生活之安定，則無所醞釀罷工矣。言雖至理，然不知此乃治標之法，未能治及其本也。觀乎今日相繼罷工聲中，已畢露社會不寗之狀態，然一般投機操縱及居奇囤積之奸商，睹斯悄景，非特無動於中，不稍斂跡，抑且乘機興風作浪，變本加厲。證之近日米價扶搖直上，影響社會，其危殆誠有千百倍於罷工風潮也。</p>
<p>故資方勉爲加薪，得將今日之工潮消弭，然投機操縱及居奇囤積之奸商，依然變本加厲，逆料來日之生活，勢必更比今日高漲，則不久之將來，難免不發生第二次第三决之同樣罷工。是以今日之加薪，以冀消弭工潮者，實爲「治標」，尙非「治本」。然處茲危逼時期，捨此加薪固傍無別法者也。</p>
<p>故自今日起，應卽謀「消弭將來工潮治本之法，若制裁投機操縱，嚴究居奇囤積之奸商，以及疏通來源，用大刀闊斧手段，絕無猜忌，而稍具人心者，亦宜値此時艱，以大局爲要，不冉有權財重於權國」之心，激發天良，救國救民，是則物價不難抑平；物價抑平，則人民生活得以安定，工潮無由醞釀矣。此猶羸病之體，應宜善以調攝，以充氣血，則任何「風邪一，不能乘虛襲入一」矣！質諸當軸及關心社會者，以爲如何？</p>
<h3>栗子</h3>
<p>— 莫非</p>
<p>跑　水菓店，大團的濃烟彌漫着，隱的聽到劈拍的爆裂聲，同時有一股異香夾雜松脂味鑽進鼻孔來。</p>
<p>「栗子上市」紅紙黑字，挺惹眼的！</p>
<p>栗子是自己最喜愛的。兩脚不知不覺地停下來了。</p>
<p>袋是跟去年的一般大小，價錢却漲了一倍，—每袋兩角。</p>
<p>袖着栗子回家，孩子們迎上來，大的一個扯着袖子，一下子給發見了。「什麼？呵，栗子！」</p>
<p>「栗子！栗子！」小的孩子也喊了起來。</p>
<p>不能不拿出來了。一齊倒出，叫老大數數，一共十一顆。兩毛錢，十一顆！</p>
<p>三個人均分：每人三顆，尙餘兩顆，給妻嘗嘗，應應時</p>
<p>但是這三顆栗子，在孩子們看來實在是太菲薄了，他們感到小滿意，妻就把應得的兩顆分給他們，並哄着說：一乖乖，不要吵，下决爸爸再買，買三包。」接着又像自語，「兩毛錢十一顆，實在太貴了。眞是良鄉栗子，難過日子！」</p>
<p>結語是近乎感歎了！事實上，妻是比我更知道生活的艱難的。一良鄉栗子，難過日子！」現在眞可爲我們這些靠些微的薪給主活者詠了！</p>
<p>「下决不買了！嘗過算了」。我對妻說。</p>

<h3>舞后的歸宿</h3>
<p>— 程小靑著</p>
<p>第八章　捉住了兩個人</p>
<p>我耐足了性，在車程中一路保守靜默。等到汽車駛到愛文路寓所門前，我又暗暗歡喜，料想他到了寓裏，總不能冉做緘口的金人。因爲他所說的「還遠」兩個字，的確使我感到莫名其妙。</p>
<p>施桂帶着歡喜的面容迎接我們倆到了裏面。蘇媽也早已佈置好餐桌，端上飯來。霍桑放下了帽子，馬上就坐到餐桌上去，又給我當頭澆了一桶冷水。「包朗，快吃飯，有話等一回談。」</p>
<p>孔老夫子「食不言」的格言，霍桑平日是並不遵守的。這是他又明明不讓我在吃飯時發話。這究竟是什麼意思呢；難道他果眞飢餓已極，口無二用，忙着要吃飯嗎？並不，因爲他舉筷以後，祗忽忽地吃了一淺碗飯，跟他平日的飯量比較，祇够得上一個倒四折。他放了筷，坐到那隻他當坐的沙發上去。我本來並不很飢，又受了他的影響，飯量當然也大打折扣。當蘇媽進來收拾碗筷的時候，也帶着詫異的面孔，不過伊見了霍桑臉上那種嚴冷的神氣，却不敢多嘴。一回兒，我們倆都已燒着了紙烟。我的被遏制的疑問終於耐不住了</p>
<p>「霍桑，這到底是什麼一回事？據我看來，這案子進展得非常順利。你怎麼反而滿臉心事？」</p>
<p>霍桑吐了口烟，瞧着地板答道：「我受不住他的一陣冷笑。」</p>
<p>我忙這：「他的冷笑？你說趙伯雄嗎？」</p>
<p>霍桑點點頭，並不答話。</p>
<p>我又說：「奇怪，他笑一笑，竟使你這樣氣悶。你竟跟他鬥氣？你不是常說當偵探的人，應得把握着理智，不能　感悄的支配？現在你因着他的一聲冷笑，竟會如此，那豈不是笑話？」　（一二二）</p>
<h3>爲女靑年會募捐</h3>
<p>— 南平</p>
<p>讀「爲女靑年會建築募捐吿女同學書」一文後，使我非常感動。我雖然是個男同學，但是我本着以往女靑年會對我的幫助，我願意以男同學的立塲向男同學們也有「所告」：</p>
<p>自上海成了「孤島」以後，對同學們的直接的影響有二：是校舍的狹小，設備的簡陋，課室光錢的幽暗，學生宿舍及課餘休息室的缺乏。另外就是課外沒有正當娛樂。女靑年會在這三年來就打聞了她的大鬥，讓靑年的男女同學湧入。在她們已經擁擠不堪的會所的每一塊空間，都空出來爲同學目修，休息，打球，上操，這些同學是不分男女的。所以我說女靑年會對於男同學的服務，是等量於女同學的。</p>
<p>現在，女靑年會正在她的最困難的時候。工作發展得極廣泛，而會所都不數用，在這鬧着地方恐慌之際，房主却連這「不敷用的地方」也不許她們住下去了；不但公然在前面的美麗的草地上蓋起房子來，就是隱蔽在後面的舊樓，也只能住到明年八月。這樣一個劉社會有貢獻，有着悠久歷史機關，我們願意她歸於消滅嗎？不能，決不能！那末我們只有站在與女靑年會一條的戰綫上，盡我們的一份力量，來幫助推動女靑年會的建築捐。</p>
<p>希望男同學們抓住這服務社會的好機會，慷慨解囊，每個人都要拿出一份力量來。將來女靑年會的學生廳造好後，我們也可以深深的呼一口氣說：「這裏面也有我一份。」</p>

<h3>British Publicly Warns Japan: No More Appeasement, Determined to Reopen Burma Road and Actively Aid China, While Speeding Up Talks with the U.S.</h3>
<p>London – The British government last night publicly warned Japan, saying that Britain has been at war for over a year and, based on past experience, deeply understands that it should no longer adopt an appeasement (or绥靖) policy towards the Japanese. British officials here sharply responded to the broadcast speech of Japanese Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka. A spokesman for the British government said, "Japan may soon realize that the attitude of the British government today is very different from what it was a year ago." It is generally believed here that the spokesman's statement is a prelude to Britain's determination to reopen the Yunnan-Burma Road, preparing to transport munitions to the Chongqing government as soon as the Anglo-Japanese agreement expires on October 18. The reason for Britain's change in attitude is a reaction to Japan's connection with the Axis powers. According to this British expression, it is the beginning of a tough attitude towards Japan, and it is also Britain's preparation for full cooperation with the United States in the future to seek further retaliation against Japan, so as to take compensation for Japan's aggressive actions in Asia. (United Press, 29th)</p>
<p>London – Although British newspapers pay close attention to the new German-Italian-Japanese pact, they show absolutely no sign of panic or worry. Generally, it seems that this pact does not change the overall situation much, but merely crystallizes a situation that previously existed in fact, even if not in name. As far as Britain is concerned, the situation of the European war will not be affected in any way. There are one or two things that can indeed excite people. One is the attitude of American newspapers. Although this pact is mainly aimed at the United States, American policy has not been threatened by it, nor has America shown any weakness. America obviously still wants to proceed with its established policy without change. One is that Tokyo is not as exaggerated about this pact as Germany and Italy. In addition, there is another important point, namely the attitude of the Soviet Union. The Daily Telegraph reports that the Soviet Union will definitely feel that this pact puts the Soviet Union in a cold storage room, and warns the Soviet Union that if it interferes in the European or Chinese war, it will be attacked by both the West. Although this pact is more direct to the United States, since Japan is mired in China, it cannot make a terrible threat to the United States. Therefore, the United States can still decide its position and ignore this. The newspaper's diplomatic correspondent said that, according to the information received, Moscow does not seem to be satisfied with this, probably because this new one is an expanded anti-British agreement. As far as Britain is concerned, London's efforts to mediate the Sino-Japanese war will therefore be suspended. The Times diplomatic correspondent said that British-American talks on the Chinese matter will be accelerated and reach an important degree corresponding to this new one. The Times diplomatic correspondent also said that the German-Italian-Japanese tripartite alliance stipulates in Article 3 that if one of the contracting parties is attacked by a country that has not yet participated in the war against Britain or the Sino-Japanese war, the contracting parties agree to provide military assistance to each other, the intention is to threaten the United States, or to shift its preparations from the Atlantic to the Pacific when it is not threatened at all. Japan may be able to help the Axis powers in this regard, but how the Axis powers can help Japan is not easy to see. German and Italian troops cannot go to the Far East. They themselves are in urgent need of naval assistance and the supply of raw materials and munitions. How can they supply Japan with military force and raw materials? The News Chronicle editorial said that this is obviously an attempt to threaten the United States, and it can now be asserted that it will not succeed. The triangle alliance of aggressor countries is still without the Soviet-German pact of last year, and it must have been established earlier. Japan is indeed suspicious and angry about this Soviet-German pact. Japan is encountering the continued struggle on the Chinese side, and feels the reduction in the supply of raw materials. Its situation is becoming increasingly dangerous. Is this why Japan now wants to formally conclude this alliance? In practical terms, the alliance of aggressor countries has only promoted the negotiations between Britain, Australia, and the United States on the issue of Pacific defense. (Reuters, 29th)</p>
<p>London – The Times commented on the German-Italian-Japanese pact, saying that these three countries are most afraid of American intervention. The Axis powers obviously want Japan to blockade Asia, which is unfavorable to the United States, so that American resources cannot be used as a backup for Britain. Before Japan proceeds with its aggression to threaten American power, it also wants to have support, even if it is just empty talk on paper, it is better than nothing. This can be seen from the anti-American tone of Japanese newspapers. (Reuters, 29th)</p>
<h3>Soviet Radio Report: Situation in Vietnam, Tensions in the Pacific, Now Progressing Daily</h3>
<p>London – A reporter from Moscow Radio, reviewing developments in Vietnam today, said that tensions in the Pacific are now progressing daily. Although the reporter did not mention the German-Italian-Japanese pact, he summarized official documents and newspaper criticisms from Japan, the United States, Britain, and other parties regarding Japan's actions in Vietnam. (Reuters, 29th)</p>
<h3>The U.S. Responds to the Tripartite Military Alliance by Improving Relations with the Soviet Union; Wallace Asks for a Swift Response to Aggression</h3>
<p>New York – The New York Times reported that the U.S. government will answer the new German-Italian-Japanese alliance by improving relations with the Soviet Union. According to a Washington dispatch, central figures have considered the political significance and economic possibilities in the current situation, and the ban on scrap iron exports may be expanded to apply to iron blocks and steel blocks, which will also be discussed, but no decision has been made yet. The New York Herald reported that the United States is now gradually making the Atlantic safe, and the threats encountered in the Pacific will also be dealt with in the same resolute manner. The United States needs bases and must reach an understanding with the South American republics and Australia and New Zealand. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch said that the German-Italian-Japanese pact prompted the United States to get closer to the vortex of world politics. The New Orleans News said that the German-Italian-Japanese pact does not change the truth of the situation in any way. If Nazi interests in the East are hindered in the future, Hitler may not respect Japan's superior position in the East. (Reuters, 29th)</p>
<p>New York – The New York World-Telegram carried yesterday that the United States is rapidly preparing to move towards war. The newspaper reviewed all the developments in the past forty-eight hours, including the US ban on scrap iron, the US loan of $15 million to China, the three-power military agreement between Germany, Italy and Japan, and the statement issued by British Ambassador Lothian, and so on. The newspaper called on Congress to seriously consider whether it is appropriate to fight or refuse to fight. (United Press, 29th)</p>
<p>Los Angeles – Democratic Vice Presidential candidate Wallace said here last night that as a result of the alliance between Japan and the Axis powers, the United States must arm itself quickly and prepare to deal with aggression in an effective manner. (United Press, 19th)</p>
<p>New York – The New York News yesterday demanded that President Roosevelt completely sever US-Japan business relations, and at the same time increase US aid to China. The newspaper said, "We should increase our aid to China. We must cut off the source of weapons by which Japan destroys others." (United Press, 29th)</p>
<h3>Welles Speaks Out, Condemns Germany, Italy, and Japan; U.S. Determined to Exert All Efforts to Aid Britain, Attaches Importance to Far East Interests</h3>
<p>Cleveland – U.S. Under Secretary of State Welles said that the United States will do everything in its power to help Britain to fight for its survival, and at the same time condemned the aggression of Germany and Italy, and said that Japan disregards its obligations in law and morality, and only thinks of using force to fulfill its long-cherished wish to build a new order in East Asia. He continued to speak a warning, "This may be the most urgent period affecting the independence and survival of the United States." (United Press, 29th)</p>
<p>Cleveland – U.S. Secretary of State Welles stated here yesterday that Japan's desire to create its new order in Asia has clearly indicated its desire to independently determine the extent to which American historical interests and treaty rights in the Far East should be limited. Hundreds of incidents of destroying American interests have occurred, but there is no problem that cannot be resolved peacefully through negotiation, as long as the parties involved have the sincerity to seek an equal and fair solution, and give appropriate recognition to the rights and real needs of the parties involved. However, the United States must prepare for all unexpected events, arm itself quickly, and defend our new world to defend against the dangers that threaten us. The development of close relations between the American republics is one of the good phenomena in recent international relations. (Reuters, 29th)</p>
<p>Washington – Yesterday, the US government strongly criticized the recently signed German-Italian-Japanese public, and proclaimed a policy that it will "materially assist the land of fire, and assist the people of Britain at the beginning." Under Secretary of State Welles told the totalitarian countries at the diplomatic conference in Cleveland that the US’s unlimited assistance to Britain will be expanded to Australia and New Zealand in the future. Officials said that the expansion of US assistance to Britain may cause the US to conflict with Germany, Italy, and Japan at the same time. When talking about the US need for equal opportunities for trade in the Far East, Welles said that President Luo’s program to revive the military has made it sufficient to cope with "all incidents." Welles said when talking about the strategic importance of the tripartite public that the countries of the Western Hemisphere must form an impregnable front, and finally summarized the US Far East policy as follows: (1) The legitimate rights of American personnel must be fully respected; (2) Respect all international treaties and agreements to which the United States participates; (3) Equal opportunities for trade in all countries. (International News Agency, 19th)</p>
<h3>Relationship between Japan and Australia Has Suffered Obstacles; Australian Naval Minister Hopes for British Decision on Imperial War Policy</h3>
<p>Sydney – Observers here believe last night that Japan's signing of military and economic agreements with Axis countries has clearly set an obstacle on the road for Australia to try to improve friendly relations with Japan. The tripartite agreement is a manifestation that the general public here has long expected to happen, because these three totalitarian countries have always had a history of colluding with each other. Australian officials are convinced that this military agreement is directly attacking the United States, forcing it to decide on a basic policy for the Far East. (United Press, 29th)</p>
<p>Sydney – Australian Naval Minister Cameron commented on the German-Italian-Japanese public here yesterday, saying that this is very important because it opens up the entire relationship of international issues. This move by Japan has long been expected. If this war must be carried out along the borders of the British Empire, then the British Empire should have a war policy for the entire British Empire. (Reuters, 29th)</p>
<h3>German, Italian, and Japanese Alliance Causes Unease in Dutch East Indies</h3>
<p>Tokyo – According to a report from the Yomiuri Shimbun correspondent in Batavia, the authorities in the Dutch East Indies are extremely uneasy about the establishment of the German-Italian-Japanese tripartite public. (Haitong Telegram, 29th)</p>
<p>Bandung – Newspapers in the Dutch East Indies carried that the German-Italian-Japanese military agreement has no impact on the current world situation. Local newspapers wrote editorials, comparing the agreement to "a diplomatic thrilling performance," intended only for domestic consumption. Local newspapers unanimously supported continuing commercial negotiations with Japan, but must be based on the principles at the beginning of the negotiations. The newspapers also solemnly stated that the government must refuse to consider all Japanese proposals regarding the "New Order of Greater East Asia." (United Press, 29th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Conclusion of the Tripartite Alliance and the Far East</h3>
<p>Regarding the signing of the German-Italian-Japanese tripartite alliance, this newspaper has already analyzed it yesterday. Now, please go on to clarify its impact on the Far East situation and Japan itself. Of course, the so-called tripartite alliance is just a virtual threat in the minds of the world, and it is also a last resort because they have failed to quickly fulfill their long-cherished wishes. However, the three countries themselves may not have great expectations for this, and believe that it is the future that they are entrusted with. It is true that Japan, which has been suffering from isolation for a long time, has unexpectedly gained two totalitarian powers as allies after hitting walls everywhere. It should always feel extremely complacent! And the recent Vietnam dispute, the Japanese side disregarded the warnings from Britain and the United States and brazenly took military action, undoubtedly relying on this about-to-be-concluded alliance relationship as a talisman. However, judging from the scene of the Japanese side in recent days, there is no sign of excitement. For example, the expression of the government authorities: Matsuoka compared it to using the national fortune as a lone bet, and Konoe called on the people to sacrifice and obey; in the promotion of their achievements, the color of uneasiness is deeply shaped. It can be seen that this move by the Japanese side cannot show any improvement in its international position at all, but is throwing itself into a new and greater adventure; the future of its fortunes and misfortunes is not expressed by the Japanese authorities who personally ordered this alliance. What kind of grasp does it have?</p>
<p>The so-called German-Italian-Japanese alliance is not a new problem, but just an outstanding case left over from more than a year ago. It is also a problem that the Hiranuma cabinet discussed and decided many times but failed to take concrete steps. Comparing the current international situation with that of more than a year ago: France has withdrawn from the international political stage, and Britain is also weaker than before, while Germany and Italy are much stronger than before. These are all factors that are beneficial to Japan's alliance with Germany and Italy. But Japan's own problem is in the Pacific. This is what Germany and Italy have always been absolutely powerless to do. On the other hand, surrounding Japan are China, which is resisting the war, the huge Soviet Union, the United States, which is increasingly concerned about the Far East, and Britain, whose strength is still not to be underestimated. These are all factors that are enough to determine Japan's future destiny. However, Japan only has contempt, anger, or hypocrisy towards them, and the relationship in any aspect is not a bit more advanced than a year ago. To form an alliance with countries far away, and to provoke the resentment of neighboring countries, the diplomatic achievements like this are not necessarily better than any of Konoe and Matsuoka's predecessors, but they are unwilling to pay such a high price.</p>
<p>According to the original text of the tripartite alliance, even if mutual understanding has been achieved in dividing the world, the wars of Germany and Italy in Europe and Japan's aggression in the Far East can only be carried out with their own strength until a third country is involved, and cannot immediately obtain mutual assistance. As far as Germany and Italy are concerned, since their international relations will not change due to the conclusion of this, they will not be affected in any way. But in Japan, the problem is not so simple: First, the policy of appeasement in the Far East will no longer have room for application, and the claim of condoning the crimes of aggression in the Far East for the past nine years will also have no possibility of existence. The opportunity for the aggressor to carry out vertical and horizontal operations is imperceptibly eliminated. Second, Japan's past economic and material dependence on Britain and the United States will be completely cut off. Recently, Japan's foreign trade and international balance of payments have fallen into a very unfavorable position, and this will inevitably become more and more miserable in the future. The southbound route is intended to open up economic resources, but it is not enough to replace the past British-American relationship, and it must also pay a heavy price. Opportunities such as Vietnam are not necessarily able to be encountered again. Third, the main purpose of the tripartite alliance is to contain the United States and scare away the United States. In fact, what is contained is extremely limited, and the intimidation is even more ineffective. The United States in the Far East will only become more active and severe due to this challenge. Fourth, with the international relations in the Far East becoming increasingly distinct, China's resistance to the war will naturally receive more assistance; claiming to solve the China problem with all its strength, it will have to disperse its attention and strength to deal with multifaceted oppression in the future. Fifth, although there are provisions in the tripartite alliance that the relationship with the Soviet Union will not be affected, this is only beneficial to Germany, because there is already a non-aggression treaty between the Soviet Union and Germany; as for the relationship between the Soviet Union and Japan, the so-called adjustment of relations is still just empty words. In the past, there may have been the possibility of mutual approach. When Germany, Italy, and Japan have already unreservedly divided Europe and Asia, the Soviet Union will also feel that its territory spanning Europe and Asia will be subjected to new threats, and Japan's policy of defending the north and advancing to the south may not be able to do it without any scruples in the future. In short, no matter from any aspect, it cannot be seen that Japan's current predicament will be solved by this alliance relationship. On the other hand, it will only add countless new difficulties. The Japanese authorities are not completely unaware of this prospect. Because of this, Konoe and Matsuoka have been vigorously talking about the adventure of this move and the difficulties in the future. At the same time, it can also be seen that this road is not a smooth road in the minds of the Japanese authorities. However, since other routes have been blocked, the Japanese authorities who refuse to rein in at the edge of the cliff, the only future is to engage in the final adventure of a single bet. Under these circumstances, the entire situation in the Far East may not undergo any changes, and the only one affected is the Japanese side itself.</p>
<h3>German Official Says It Does Not Hinder Soviet Aid to China; Soviet Newspapers Pay Attention to International Politics and Economy, Keeping Absolute Silence on the Tripartite Alliance</h3>
<p>Berlin – A German official said last night that the newly established German-Italian-Japanese military alliance does not prevent the Soviet Union from continuing to aid the Chinese government, provided that such aid is not "active." When reporters asked whether the Soviet Union's shipment of munitions to China conflicted with the alliance between Japan and the Axis powers, the German spokesman cited the United States' aid to Britain with 50 outdated destroyers as an arm. He said that such military assistance is not considered to be related to the provisions of the "defense" alliance. The spokesman said, "The point of decision" is how much influence the munitions aid can have on the war. As far as the transfer of 50 outdated destroyers is concerned, Britain can only use these old destroyers for transportation, so it cannot be considered helpful to the overall war situation. "German officials declined to state whether the Dutch East Indies should belong to the sphere of influence of Asia or Europe. It is said that "This matter was not mentioned in the tripartite public." When talking about Germany's attitude towards South America, the German spokesman said, "Germany has never opposed the Monroe Doctrine that America should belong to Americans. We very much hope to maintain friendly relations with all aspects of America." (United Press, 29th)</p>

<p>Japan Tries Hard to Conclude a Treaty with the Soviet Union</p>
<p>The diplomatic community in London revealed that Tokyo authoritative sources said today that Japan is very eager to get close to the Soviet Union in order to conclude a Soviet-Japanese public similar to the Soviet-German public. According to the news obtained here, Japan is directly proposing to the Soviet Union, and at the same time asking Germany to mediate. Whether this matter will succeed depends on Moscow's attitude. This attitude cannot be determined yet. However, it is heard that the Soviet representative has consulted with the US government for some time. Therefore, it is believed that the Soviet Union may use it to negotiate with Japan. At the same time, foreign correspondents stationed in Tokyo telegraphed that the Japanese military newspaper said that if the United States gives China more aid, it will be considered a provocative act, and the tripartite alliance will immediately exert its effect.

<h3>Japanese Shipping Industry Impacted by Tripartite Pact</h3>

<h3>French Government Undecided on How to Handle Vietnam Incident, Will Ultimately Be Controlled by Pragmatism, Strictly Limiting Japanese Military Privileges, Thailand Shoots at Border Police District</h3>
<p>Vichy: It is said here in political circles that French officials believe that concluding an agreement with Japan regarding Vietnam is entirely justified in completing the work of the Three-Power Military Pact. If the Vichy government continues its policy of assisting General Chiang Kai-shek and rejects Japan's ultimatum, Germany and Italy will immediately assist Japan in attacking France and England. With England making a "strategic withdrawal" in the Far East and the United States unwilling to help France protect the integrity of Vietnam, France today feels that the German-Italian-Japanese alliance is the only way to maintain the integrity of its Far Eastern empire. France, at a crossroads, must choose between the following two paths: continue to cooperate with American aid to China, but this policy will invite a Japanese attack on Vietnam. If the situation develops to this point, France, defeated by Germany in Europe, will certainly not be able to resist a Japanese attack. (2) Be willing to negotiate with Japan and recognize Japan as a major power wielding maritime hegemony in the Pacific. The Colonial Department favors the former policy, while the Foreign Ministry favors the latter. French business circles with huge investments in Vietnam and the Far East oppose the views of the French Foreign Ministry. The French government feels that if the first policy is adopted, England will not be able to help France disturb Vietnam after the attack on the Mers-el-Kébir in Oran, and Washington has not given any definite promises regarding material assistance to Vietnam. Rejecting Japan's ultimatum will inevitably lead to war, without a doubt. If such a war occurs within Vietnam, even if China sends troops to help France resist Japan, the French still feel that although China has a large population, it will still be of no avail, because China has neither a navy nor sufficient aircraft and heavy artillery to confront the Japanese. For this reason, the French will ultimately be controlled by pragmatism and sign an agreement with Japan, strictly limiting Japanese military privileges in Vietnam, allowing only the use of three airfields and not allowing the use of naval bases. Moreover, French political circles claim that France has decided not to allow the Japanese to use Vietnam as a base for attacking the United States, the Philippines, and other places, and that France's Far Eastern policy must be changed when necessary. If the United States and Japan go to war, France will remain neutral, and the French-Japanese agreement cannot bind France to provide the United States or Japan with any base for attacking the United States.

<p>Hanoi: French officials in Annam yesterday shifted their attention to Thailand, because that country recently reiterated its territorial demands to Annam and used military aircraft to shoot at the Mengsha Dieya (transliteration) police district, forty miles into Annamese territory.

<h3>United States Expands Naval, Land, and Air Force, Has Determination to Defend Territory, Roosevelt Personally Delivers Speech at Cornerstone Laying Ceremony of Washington Airport</h3>
<p>Washington: At the cornerstone laying ceremony of the new Washington Airport yesterday, President Roosevelt spoke as hundreds of planes circled overhead, saying that the roaring sound of hundreds of American planes soaring in our sky is a symbol of our determination to create defenses on the sea, land, and air to resist any attack. They represent the authority that we must soon have. We may well refer to this as a kind of combat tool that democracy can have. We hope that it will always be tasked with maintaining peace. We will do our best to use our abilities and talents to ensure that it is not used for war missions. However, the more weapons we have, the less likely we are to use them, as the attacks we will receive from overseas will decrease accordingly. News newspapers and radio broadcasts have told us Americans how increasingly important airplanes are in aggressor countries and in countries striving for national survival. All this news explains the reason why the sky fleet is the prelude to today's ceremony. The American people now have 50,000 licensed aviators, and this number increases by nearly 2,000 each month. They are certainly not all military aircraft pilots, but they are prepared to become military aircraft pilots, just as farmers became frontline warriors during President Washington's administration. President Luo's speech was broadcast nationwide by radio. The construction cost of this airport is US$13 million, making it the largest airport in the world. The project is expected to be completed on December 17th. (Reuters Telegram, 29th)</p>
<h3>First Batch of U.S. Destroyers Arrive in England, Public Greatly Excited</h3>
<p>British Naval Port: The first batch of outdated American destroyers recently transferred to England arrived here yesterday. The hulls of the ships were still painted in the gray color of American warships.

They called it the "American Fleet of England." When the destroyers entered the naval port, white flags were hoisted high on the ships, and an "Awaiting" warning flag fluttered in the air on the shore, indicating that German aircraft were about to arrive. "Spitfire" fighter planes roared overhead to protect them. As the destroyers quickly entered the port, a young sentry on board involuntarily forgot his military posture. The rifle in his hand drooped to the ground at a ninety-degree angle and shouted, "Oh, I think these ships are not bad!" (United Press Telegram, 29th)</p>

<p>Special Feature</p>
<h3>Trotsky's Death</h3>
<p>At five o'clock in the afternoon on August 20, 1940, Trotsky had just finished his tea and got up for a walk, passing through a door into a lush garden. He strolled back and forth, occasionally standing still, enjoying the refined taste of the middle class: a flower garden not essential for survival, but purely for enjoyment. The geraniums in the pots were sprouting, the roses were in full bloom; the chicks in the coop chirped, the rabbits in their enclosure frolicked, and among the branches above the twenty-foot wall, small birds chirped as the sun set. Thick shade covered the ground, branches intertwined, making the small courtyard appear particularly quiet. Above this city in Mexico, a clear sky held a few cotton-like white clouds in the distance.</p>
<p>Trotsky, in a relaxed mood, found a unique satisfaction in appreciating these scenes. Throughout his life, he had lived in the dark corners of rebellion and revolution. Now, with the passage of time, the arduous revolutionary cause had transformed into a simple, peaceful life. Old friends were few, disciples were far away, and only a handful of people visited from time to time. His writings were eloquent and of exceptional quality, worthy of a master of prose, far more admired than his revolutionary theories.</p>
<p>Trotsky, a sixty-year-old man, had written extensively, lived with his elderly wife, rented a house in the suburbs, planning to spend his remaining years in exile, and was financially comfortable enough to live a decent and orderly life. He had made it his mission to destroy the middle class, but now he had become a part of it. However, he himself did not quite believe it. He was always enveloped in an aura of revolution, like a smell emanating from a cellar, making people nauseous. Even his appearance was the same. He had a beard, like a wandering doctor, and messy hair on his forehead, clearly a political orator; his hands were thin, constantly moving; his nearsighted eyes were still bright; he walked with his shoulders hunched, his steps brisk and agile. At this moment, as he strolled in the garden, his demeanor was similar. Those plotting against him always felt that Trotsky harbored many latent dangers. He had experienced the dangers of a revolutionary, and from Turkestan to Mexico, he was always followed. His sons and younger relatives had died mysteriously during his years of exile. On May 20 of this year, thugs had sprayed his bedroom with machine guns, and he had narrowly escaped death. Mexico City was filled with male and female spies who were against him. Even so, he must have felt very safe in this small courtyard.</p>
<p>At half-past five this afternoon, a man named Frank Jackson came to visit. Trotsky thought he could not be a spy. Although Jackson had been suspected of using many aliases in Mexico City, in Trotsky's eyes, he was a promising young disciple who had also generously donated to the Fourth International. Six months earlier, a social worker from Manhattan named Sylvia Ageloff had introduced Jackson to Trotsky. Ageloff's sister had once been Trotsky's secretary. Jackson was tall, dark-skinned, and wore glasses. Originally from Yugoslavia, he had entered Mexico with a Canadian passport. He spoke English with a Brooklyn accent. The police bodyguards protecting Trotsky saw Jackson come and let him in without question.</p>
<p>Jackson had come to have Trotsky correct his manuscript. The amiable host led him into the house. As they entered, Jackson walked ahead, a coat draped over his arm. Trotsky's wife, Natalia Sedova, greeted the guest in the dining room, offering tea according to Russian custom. Jackson only asked for a glass of water, and did not take off the coat draped over his left arm. Trotsky and Jackson entered the study. Jackson still did not remove his coat.</p>
<p>The study was simply decorated, with no carpet on the floor. The walls were cream-colored, and besides a large map of Mexico, he had nothing else. In the center was a large wooden table, cluttered with books, papers, and manuscripts. Trotsky sat down to read the manuscript the guest had brought. Jackson leaned over his shoulder. Underneath his coat, he had already concealed a pistol, a dagger, and an ice axe. He had chosen this last "heavy" weapon. If a blow landed successfully, it could silently end the old man's life.</p>
<p>But Jackson was not nimble. Like Trotsky, he was used to living in the dark world of conspiracy, and his understanding of certain things was limited. If it had been a farmer or a worker, they would have known that to kill someone instantly, the first strike must be delivered with all one's strength. The ice axe was sharp, and a blow would have shattered Trotsky's skull, but unfortunately, not enough force was used. Trotsky did not fall, and did not even realize he had been struck. He only felt like he had been shot, and jumped up from his chair, grabbing the assailant and biting his hand tightly. The young Jackson, though armed with a knife, a pistol, and an ice axe, panicked and could not think of how to deal with the old man. Trotsky shouted loudly, shaking his body, and staggered into the dining room. The courageous Mrs. Trotsky blocked Jackson at the door, jumping on him and tripping him. Bodyguards Cober and Hansen also rushed to the scene. Cober knocked the assailant to the ground with a club, kicking him in the head and body. Hansen helped Trotsky lie flat on the floor. Blood poured from Trotsky's cracked skull. He said to Hansen, "Don't kill him. This man has something to say."</p>
<p>Even though Trotsky, the historian, was hanging by a thread, he still thought about how his dying moments should be passed down to posterity. Natalia shielded her husband with her body, and Trotsky pointed to his heart, saying, "I feel it here, they succeeded this time."</p>
<p>Trotsky's skull was fractured, spinal fluid leaked out, and the left side of his body began to go numb, but his mind was still clear. In the emergency room, he clearly dictated to Hansen: I was attacked by a political assassin in the room, and my life is hanging by a thread. I fought with the assailant. After he entered the room, he said he wanted to discuss French statistics. Then he struck me. Please tell our friends: I have no doubt about the victory of the Fourth International. Forward!</p>
<p>For twenty-five hours and thirty minutes after the attack, Trotsky struggled with his stubborn nature and life, as he had done since he began his revolutionary work at the age of seventeen, until the present moment. His head was operated on twice in the hospital, and the assailant was also being treated in the same hospital. His wife guarded him, never leaving his side. If a person on the verge of death can still recall past events, then the following impressions must have replayed on the membranes of Trotsky's unconscious mind: Bronstein (Trotsky's original name) at the age of nine, leaving the countryside of Kherson to study in Odessa... influenced by Marxism... imprisoned in Moscow in early 1898... marrying Alexandra Sokolovskaya... exiled to Siberia in 1900... escaping to England in 1902 under the pseudonym "Trotsky"... meeting Lenin in London... during which the First and Second Internationals were established in London and Paris... the failure of the Russian Revolution in 1905, exiled to Siberia again... escaping to Europe... returning to Russia after the March Revolution in 1917, meeting Lenin and helping with the October Revolution plan... the great achievements of reorganizing the Red Army... expelling the White Russians... establishing the Third and Fourth Internationals... exiled to Turkestan... France... Norway... Mexico... conspiracy... writing..."</p>
<p>Trotsky's death, except for his old comrades in Moscow, was generally considered terrible. Because most people had forgotten that he himself was a terrorist. The way Trotsky died is unknown to others, but some suspect that there might have been something offensive in his soon-to-be-completed "Stalin Biography." No one can guess what it was. Half of the original manuscript of this book has already been translated into English and is stored in New York; the other half, which has not been organized and translated, is stored in Mexico City. The publisher of the book does not know when it can be printed.</p>
<p>Looking at Trotsky as a writer, the writing of the "Stalin Biography" will not be of great importance in his literary reputation. His immortal work is the three-volume "History of the Russian Revolution." He was a social revolutionary, organizer, and leader. As a writer and practitioner, Trotsky will be unforgettable to the world.</p>
<p>When Lenin passed away, Trotsky suddenly blurted out thirteen words: "Lenin is dead. The news came like a huge stone sinking into the sea." When Trotsky was on the verge of death, no one wrote a word for him, which is a pity. (Translated from Time Magazine)</p>

<h3>German Aircraft Attack England in a Torrent, Guarded by Large Numbers of Fighter Planes; British Aircraft Engage, Anti-Aircraft Fire Dense as a Hailstorm; Failed to Invade Central London Last Night and This Morning</h3>
<p>London - German aircraft launched another fierce attack on England yesterday. A large number of enemy bombers, guarded by an unusually large number of fighter planes, invaded southeastern England, attempting to break into London. In the afternoon, over a hundred enemy aircraft attempted to fly to the coasts of Kent and Sussex, but were intercepted head-on by British fighter planes. After many fierce battles, the enemy aircraft retreated, none reaching London.</p>
<p>Last night, the Air Ministry and the Ministry of Home Security announced that German aircraft activity over England on Saturday and Sunday consisted of three waves. After dawn and near noon, enemy aircraft twice flew over the southeast coast, attempting to reach London, but were dispersed by British fighter planes. After dawn, a few enemy aircraft broke into eastern London, dropping a few bombs, but causing little damage. There were few casualties. During the engagement near noon, enemy aircraft did not reach London, only dropping a few bombs on a town on the southeast coast, causing some damage to houses, but no casualties were reported. In the afternoon, enemy aircraft approached the Portsmouth area but were also defeated by British aircraft, without dropping bombs. In these three air raids, the enemy used many fighter planes, so the air combat was mainly between fighter planes. According to current reports, six enemy aircraft have been shot down, while seven British aircraft are missing.</p>
<p>As of yesterday, the number of enemy aircraft lost in air combat over Britain in September reached one thousand and forty-six. In August, the enemy lost one thousand one hundred and fifteen aircraft. Counting two and a half crew members per aircraft, Germany has lost a total of two thousand one hundred and sixty-one aircraft and five thousand four hundred and two crew members since the beginning of August. After searching the North Sea for three days, British coastal aircraft and warships found the crew of a British bomber, who had been drifting in the sea in a rubber boat for eighty-four hours. (Reuters, 29th)</p>
<p>London - British anti-aircraft artillery unleashed its power this morning, causing German aircraft to only drop many heavy explosive bombs and incendiary bombs in the suburbs of London. Central London was as quiet as usual, and German aircraft were not as active as in previous night raids. (United Press, 29th)</p>
<p>London - This morning, German aircraft again raided England. Northwest and northeast England, Merseyside, and the East Midlands were bombed. Only a few enemy aircraft seemed to have broken through the defenses of central London. Most bombs fell in the suburbs. Enemy aircraft used various methods in an attempt to break through the anti-aircraft fire network, including some attempting to shut off their engines and glide, but ultimately could not escape the bombardment of anti-aircraft shells. Seeing no hope of breaking through, German aircraft dropped bombs in the suburbs and then retreated. (Reuters, 29th)</p>
<p>Berlin - German aircraft again flew to London yesterday, bombing military targets. Although British aircraft were on high alert and anti-aircraft artillery fired densely, German aircraft completed their mission and returned without any losses. The West India Docks were hit and caught fire, causing heavy losses. (Haitong News Agency, 29th)</p>
<p>Berlin - German aircraft bombed West Ham last night, hitting the area's power plant and causing heavy damage. West Ham is located on the north bank of the Thames River. (Haitong News Agency, 29th)</p>
<h3>British Long-Range Guns Roar All Night; Calais Becomes a Useless Port; French Coast Again Subjected to Fierce Air Raids; Explosions Shake the Coast Across the Channel</h3>
<p>Vichy - According to news from various ports in northern France last night, British long-range guns and bombers have rendered the port of Calais useless. The docks and waterways have been destroyed, and ships have been sunk. Calais has suffered terrible losses. British long-range guns bombarded German gun emplacements at Calais and Cap Gris-Nez all night, firing every few minutes. German guns also returned fire towards Dover. British bombers hoped to destroy all German guns, but suffered heavy losses due to intense German anti-aircraft fire. (United Press, 29th)</p>
<p>London - According to the Air Ministry's intelligence office, on Friday night, British air forces flew to the French coast across the turbulent Strait of Dover with strong north winds, fiercely attacking German bases. The violent explosions shook the coast of Kent. Hundreds of heavy bombs were dropped on military targets, and flames shot straight into the sky. Enemy searchlights illuminated the sky, and anti-aircraft shells flew and roared. The port of Lorient on the French Atlantic coast was heavily bombed. Dockyard buildings were destroyed, and warehouses and material factories were hit and caught fire. The fire could be seen seventy miles away. The raid lasted three and a half hours. The night was clear and visibility was good, so British aircraft were able to accurately assess the damage caused by their bombs. In the first hour, bombs were dropped at a rate of five per minute. The fire spread rapidly. British aircraft used the light of the fire to drop bombs on ships moored in the river, causing explosions that lasted two minutes each. The Harvard dockyard was completely shaken, and steel and lead factories were also hit. Multiple oil pools were also hit. Another British squadron penetrated German territory, bombing railway yards in Mannheim and Hamm, and a large munitions factory in Dusseldorf. All British aircraft returned safely.</p>
<p>A Reuters air force correspondent said that the various ports and bases along the European coastline, which Germany considered extremely important, are now under the threat of the British air force. The attack on Lorient on Friday night was a step south in the British plan to attack ports along the coastline. Previously, the British air force's range of attack extended from Bergen in the north to Brest in the south, and its main efforts were concentrated between Hamburg and Le Havre. But British aircraft can now launch attacks along the entire European coastline from the southern end of France to the northern end of Norway, in retaliation for German air raids on England from various directions.

<p>Education News</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Education Prevents Rising Book Prices; Issues Five Measures</h3>
<p>(Chongqing Airmail) The Ministry of Education believes that the continuous rise in book prices hinders cultural development, and has issued five measures based on the proposals submitted by the Preparatory Office of the National Central Library, ordering the education departments and bureaus of all provinces and cities to instruct the book industry to comply. The measures are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The quality of paper need not be exquisite, and the binding need not be beautiful. As long as the collation is accurate and the printing is clear, it will be a beautiful edition today. Native paper can be used, and all imported products such as art paper and newsprint should be avoided to reduce costs.</p>
<p>(2) Printing can imitate the methods of the Central Daily News, publishing in different locations. Only paper plates need to be sent for casting and printing, thus saving costs.</p>
<p>(3) Wages in Hong Kong are higher than in the mainland. If printing and distribution are done in the mainland, wages can be reduced.</p>
<p>(4) For printing projects that are heavy and cannot be published in Hong Kong and Shanghai, the Ministry of Education should ask the Ministry of Communications to instruct the railway bureau to provide convenience when transporting books.</p>
<p>(5) As for the current book prices, reference books are necessary for individuals and institutions, so the price increase is particularly large, which is unbearable for ordinary readers. The existing printed books and those that were transported to the mainland before the war should not be priced at the same level as newly printed and newly transported books.</p>

<h3>Recent News on the Collection of Winter Clothing Donation in the City's Educational Circles; Strictly Following Regulations; Remittance Method Unchanged</h3>
<p>(Dahua News Agency) Previously, the educational sector of this city, in order to expand the promotion of the winter clothing donation campaign, formulated measures and ordered all schools to implement them. Educational groups throughout the city also responded actively, urging their affiliates to promote them consistently, with enthusiastic situations and remarkable results. Details have been reported in various newspapers. According to the original regulations, after the winter clothing donation was collected, each school should directly remit it to the Chongqing Winter Clothing Donation Headquarters or entrust the newspaper or bank in Shanghai that collects donations on its behalf to forward it. Each school also consistently followed this. However, recently, each school suddenly received a mimeographed notice bearing the name "Yu Zheng," stating that in the future, the donations collected by each school should be handed over to the "Shanghai Refugee Relief Society" or the "Shanghai Refugee Relief Association" in this city, and there is no need to send it to the bank, etc. The educational sector of this city has denied issuing this notice, and each school still follows the original regulations, stepping up the fundraising work? Consistently remitting it directly to the Chongqing Headquarters or the collecting newspaper or bank.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Dahua News Agency reported that Yuan Jianming, a student in the first grade of the junior high school department of a certain private middle school in this city, was deeply indignant because the school was promoting the winter clothing donation campaign, and each student paid half a yuan according to the prescribed standard, and they were all obtained from their families, so he could not donate as much as possible with his own savings. Therefore, he emptied his pockets of his savings from previous years, totaling fifty yuan, and donated them all, in order to encourage teachers and students of the school to respond, and the amount of fundraising suddenly increased.</p>
<h3>School News</h3>
<p>Jian Guang Volunteer School: The Jian Guang Scholarship Fund Management Committee, in order to relieve out-of-school children and assist the nation in eliminating illiteracy, specially established seven Jian Guang Volunteer Primary Schools. Since their establishment last autumn, they have been actively expanding. This semester, one more school has been added, distributed in various concession areas. After the summer vacation volunteer class ends this autumn, preparations for all school opening matters for this semester will be made. Currently, all volunteer schools are uniformly opening in early September. Due to the sharp increase in social commodity prices, volunteer school students are even more enthusiastic. It is heard that the teachers and administrators of each school are strongly advocating strictness, which has gained the trust of students' parents. Therefore, after the start of school, there are still students requesting to enroll one after another, but due to the quota being full, it is impossible to accommodate them. It is heard that the person in charge of the committee is trying to find ways to add new schools to provide relief.</p>

<h3>Reducing Deposit Interest Rates and Future Speculation</h3>
<p>— Zhang Liu</p>
<p>A few days ago, I saw news in the newspaper that Zhejiang Industrial Bank reduced deposit interest rates. The reduction method is to reduce the interest rate by one-tenth of a percent for current deposits on October 1. Then I saw reports that Yanye, JinCheng, Zhongnan, Mainland and the Four Banks Savings Association, for current and current account deposits, whether in the Commercial Department, Savings Department or Trust Department, all reduced by one-tenth of a percent. We do not know whether these banks have increased deposit rates in the past; however, one thing we can know is that recently, the banking industry has felt that the use of funds is becoming increasingly difficult, and they have to reduce their burden by reducing interest rates. This really illustrates the recent trend of Shanghai's industrial, commercial and financial sectors, which is worth paying attention to.</p>
<p>Regarding the question of whether interest should be given on current deposits, the general opinion of banking scholars is that, according to the customs of various countries, interest should not be given, because the procedures are more complicated and the deposits are not sought for long-term use. However, in our country, current deposits have always had interest, but the interest rate is generally lower than that of fixed deposits. The reason for this may be that the deposit interest rates in our country are generally higher than those in other countries, so current deposits cannot but pay interest.</p>
<p>The level of deposit interest rates is usually determined by each bank at its own discretion. Generally, those who need deposits more urgently cannot but increase the interest rate relatively. Those who do not need deposits may reduce the interest rate relatively. However, on the other hand, the level of deposit interest rates can actually reflect the situation of the country obtaining production funds. The deposit interest rate is higher, and the lending interest rate must also increase accordingly, that is, the production sector must bear a larger interest rate to obtain funds. Conversely, the deposit interest rate is low, the production sector can obtain funds more easily, and the burden of interest is also lighter, and the business is naturally easy to develop. Our country's production is backward, and the rural areas have not yet emerged from feudal society, so there is still a high-interest loan situation. As for cities and urban areas, it is easier to obtain funds due to the development of the banking industry, so the interest rate is lower than that in the inland areas. Shanghai's deposit interest rate can be said to be a relatively low area in the country, but compared with the local foreign banks, it is still higher. The burden of obtaining funds for Chinese businesses is still heavier than that of foreign merchants. Therefore, reducing deposit interest rates is very beneficial to the development of production.</p>
<p>Because the level of interest rates has the effect of regulating production funds, the interest rate policy is also one of the main topics in the national financial policy. Generally speaking, in times of financial tension, high interest rates can be used to retain the outflow of funds, while in times of financial relaxation, low interest rates can be used to make the turnover of industrial funds more active. In addition, it also has a considerable effect on the adjustment of production prices in theory, because the interest rate is a direct burden on production unemployment and also one of the commodity cost burdens, so the level of the interest rate can directly affect prices.</p>
<p>What is the motive behind this reduction of deposit interest rates by various banks in Shanghai? What kind of reaction will the reduction have on today's Shanghai? Here is a simple exploration.</p>
<h3>The Strange Phenomenon of Speculation with Borrowed Money</h3>
<p>"The increase in floating capital" has become a common catchphrase for Shanghai people, but the increase in floating capital really illustrates the wartime situation of Shanghai's financial market. Why does Shanghai feel that there is too much floating capital? If there is really too much floating capital, then why have our exchange rates risen sharply in the past six months? It can be seen that there is too much floating capital, this is a fact, and the production sector does not obtain easier funds because of the excess of floating capital, this is also a fact.</p>
<p>After the August 13th incident, Shanghai did not feel the excess of floating capital. Due to the decline of general industry and commerce, the banking industry was unable to use the accumulated funds. The following March, after the black market for foreign exchange occurred, the escape of funds became increasingly open, and the number of escapes also increased day by day. Funds from the inland areas flowed to Shanghai due to trade surpluses, and the escape of funds was also greatly increased due to the development of speculative businesses in Shanghai. Therefore, the flow of funds throughout the country is almost centered on Shanghai, while the funds in Shanghai are concentrated on the escape of funds. The most obvious is foreign exchange arbitrage. The so-called foreign exchange arbitrage is a kind of activity that directly buys foreign exchange with funds first, which is of no benefit to the national economy and the people's livelihood. The people who buy foreign exchange with borrowed funds are eager to obtain compensation for debts and are willing to bear higher interest rates. This interest is the source of foreign exchange arbitrage, and the amount often reaches 40% per month, which is a weekly interest of 4.8%. Regular bankers do not engage in businesses such as arbitrage, but the newly established silver houses and enterprise companies are collectively investing in arbitrage, which is already very open. Funds are somewhat like flowing water. Water flows to the low places, and funds naturally flow to the profitable places. With such a good place to go, the interest rate of depositors has invisibly increased, and everyone is willing to borrow money to speculate, which is one of the reasons for the high interest rates in Shanghai after the war.</p>
<p>What about the industrial and commercial circles? They are also willing to bear higher interest rates to engage in the expansion of production. Following the fluctuations in the foreign exchange black market, prices also rose accordingly. Every factory, as long as it stores more raw materials, its profits often exceed its entire year's sales of finished goods. The production sector has gained huge profits due to the rise in prices. On the one hand, they purchase and store a large amount of raw materials, and on the other hand, they greatly expand manufacturing, because their profits are high, so they are also willing to bear higher interest rates. This is also one of the reasons for the high interest rates in Shanghai after the war.</p>
<p>Because of the increased escape of funds, the advancement of speculation, and various reactions, every industrial and commercial operator needs funds, every speculator also needs funds, and at the same time, regular financial operators also need funds to prevent the outflow of funds and the expansion of business. We see the surge of silver houses and money exchange shops, they are the organizations that absorb funds. In this state, the general interest rate of funds will naturally rise.</p>
<p>Far-sighted scholars see this phenomenon and believe that it is the work of floating capital, so they put forward the slogan "Go to the Southwest", but it has not been successful so far. The reason for this is naturally many. One is that the production equipment in the inland areas has not been able to adjust and cooperate with the funds, and the other is that the interest income in Shanghai is far above the general investment.</p>
<h3>Entering Old Tombs or Finding a Living</h3>
<p>Now the Shanghai banking industry has proposed the fact of reducing deposit interest rates. According to the past unreasonable high-interest loan situation, reducing deposits is naturally a gratifying phenomenon. But after the interest rate is reduced, does it mean that the future floating capital will tend to the regular path; and the regular industrial and commercial operators can therefore obtain low-interest capital turnover?</p>
<p>No, rather than inferring the consequences from the reduction of deposit interest rates, it is more appropriate to explore its driving force. The first thing we want to point out is that today's reduction of deposit interest rates in Shanghai does not at all mean that the trend of the financial circle is rationalized, but simply means that this is the decline of Shanghai's "prosperity". These floating capitals, which used to be powerful in the speculative market, are now idle.</p>
<p>The biggest reason is the long-term stability of the foreign exchange black market. After mid-June of this year, the foreign exchange black market recovered from a tense state, and the return of huge amounts of funds made it impossible for people who bought foreign exchange to obtain any benefits. The exchange rate against the US dollar has risen from more than four yuan per hundred yuan to more than six yuan. Many speculators have failed in this decisive storm. The so-called arbitrage activities have also become unprofitable due to the decline in speculation. Since the largest destination of funds has been blocked, the funds that escaped in the past have returned to the hands of banks and money houses, and the deposits in banks and money houses can only accumulate.</p>
<p>Due to the easing of the exchange market, it has also affected the commodity market. Major commodities such as cotton yarn have almost fallen in price by 50%. The decline in commodity prices has certainly affected the production of factories, and the blockade of the Southwest, Myanmar, and Vietnam roads has gradually reduced the scope of industrial and commercial activities. The need for funds is also significantly different from the past situation of the more the better.</p>
<p>These two situations are precisely the evolution of the entire Shanghai market. According to the general theory of prosperity, in the rising period of prosperity, industry is active, interest rates are high, and prices are high. The opposite is true in the declining period. The prosperity caused by the devaluation of currency is similar. Although the foreign exchange indication of legal currency does not at all mean the devaluation of currency, the special prosperity caused by the devaluation of the foreign exchange black market is similar to the prosperity that occurs during the devaluation. And all the phenomena felt today are similar to the consequences of currency contraction, and reducing deposit interest rates is one of the indicators of this.</p>
<p>This kind of reduction in deposit interest rates can affect the reduction in lending interest rates, but this reduction will not make the industrial and commercial circles feel any substantial benefits, because the entire operating mechanism of the industrial and commercial circles is also in a state of stagnation. It is even less likely to happen in Shanghai.</p>
<p>But this does not illustrate the pessimism of the entire financial market prospects, thinking that funds really cannot find a home. We believe that Shanghai is in a special situation today, and bankers should be aware of the past methods of using funds. Ten years ago, we criticized the investment goals of Chinese banks as foreign exchange, public bonds and real estate. Five years ago, the items of real estate and foreign exchange gradually disappeared, but today, ten years later, the investment goals of the banking industry have unconsciously returned to the old tombs! The foundation of the prosperity of the banking industry naturally relies on the production business. After grasping this point and reducing deposit interest rates, how should we invest? Perhaps everyone knows this.</p>
<h3>Overview of Japan's Resources</h3>
<p>— Yan Maode</p>
<p>As everyone knows, Japan is a country with innate deficiencies and extremely scarce resources. However, modern warfare is a war of massive material consumption. Without abundant resources, the war cannot be continued.</p>
<p>Now, thirty-seven months after the Sino-Japanese War, what is Japan's resource situation? This is undoubtedly extremely important for estimating the future of the war. Moreover, recently the United States has implemented an embargo on oil and iron to Japan, which has had a major impact on Japan. Therefore, we need to review Japan's resource situation.</p>
<p>For the sake of convenience, we will divide Japan's resources into five aspects: metal resources, power resources, food resources, chemical resources, and textile resources:</p>
<p>Metal resources: It can be said that the metal resources owned by Japan are extremely scarce, especially the very important resource - pig iron, which Japan is particularly lacking. According to a survey by the Geological Society of Japan, the reserves of iron ore in Japan are 101.95 million tons, with an iron content of 40.32 million tons. The reserves in Korea are about 100 million tons. According to estimates by the International Geological Society, the reserves of iron ore in Japan are only 56 million tons, of which the iron content is only 18 million tons.</p>
<p>The difference between the above two estimates is obviously due to the inclusion of water. But even if we admit that the former is reliable, it is still not enough to supply domestic consumption. Because in 1936, Japan's iron consumption was 4 million tons, of which 1 million tons were mined in Japan and Korea, and the remaining 3 million tons were completely dependent on imports from China, the Malay Peninsula, the Philippines, and Australia. In September last year, Japan announced a ban on the sale of steel to private individuals, showing the seriousness of its wartime steel production problem. Now the United States has implemented an embargo on scrap iron to Japan, which is bound to increase the degree of panic about Japanese steel, which will become an extremely serious problem in the future of the war.</p>
<p>As for other light metals, Japan also feels a great lack. Although the reserves of copper (about 150 million tons) and production are quite high, it still needs to import a lot. 52% of the annual amount is imported from the United States. Aluminum and tin, which are needed in industry, are also purchased from abroad by 90% and 70% respectively each year. The self-sufficiency of aluminum is only one-tenth, that of zinc is two-tenths, and that of nickel is almost completely non-self-sufficient; in addition, Japan is certainly very lacking in alloy materials such as manganese, antimony, tungsten, zinc, cobalt, cadmium, and chromium, which are necessary for military needs.</p>
<p>Power resources: Japan's coal reserves are certainly not as good as those of the United States, the Soviet Union, Germany, the United Kingdom, and China, but they are still barely satisfactory. According to surveys, the coal reserves in Japan are about 628 million tons, and those in Korea, South Sakhalin, Taiwan, etc. are 199.5 million tons, totaling more than 827 million tons. The recent production volume has been as high as tens of millions of tons, of which 90% can be self-sufficient. However, we must pay attention to the fact that most of Japan's coal production is bituminous coal with too much volatile component, so it cannot obtain good char coal (the so-called coking coal). Therefore, the coking coal used for manufacturing metallurgy and the iron-making industry is almost completely lacking. As a famous Japanese professor, Inu Kami's survey shows that only 15% of Japan's coal is available for industrial use, and the coking coal used for the metal industry that manufactures military supplies is mostly dependent on foreign imports.</p>
<p>Of the power resources, the more important is oil. Japan's oil consumption is about 40 million tons per year, but the actual self-sufficiency capacity is only 4 million tons, that is, the insufficient quantity reaches 90%, all of which depends on imports from the United States, etc. However, after the United States implemented an embargo on oil to Japan, it is bound to become the biggest problem in Japan's resources. It is not known to what extent the current reserves have reached, but no matter what, they cannot last for a long time if the war is prolonged. What's more, the amount of money that Japan flows out overseas to purchase oil reaches 172 million yuan. If Japan's oil runs out, not only will its domestic cars not be able to start, but even its invasion tools - airplanes and tanks, etc., can only be displayed publicly as exhibits on the battlefield.</p>
<p>Food resources: The main foods of the Japanese people are rice (accounting for 60%), wheat, soybeans, fish, meat, sweet potatoes, and other miscellaneous grains. It can be seen that rice is Japan's basic food. In the past ten years, the domestic rice production in Japan has been about 65 million stones per year, and the consumption needs about 75 million stones per year, with an annual shortage of about 10 million stones; the insufficient amount is imported from Korea and Taiwan. However, this year (1939-1940) Korea also feels the same rice shortage, and it will not be able to supply Japan any longer, thus causing a great panic in Japan's food supply. As for wheat, Japan needs 3 million tons per year, and its self-sufficiency capacity is 40%, and most of the insufficient amount depends on Australia and Canada. We know that Japan is an agricultural country, and 48% of its people belong to the farming class. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, many farmers have been conscripted, resulting in today's shortage of labor and high wages in Japan, and the output of fertilizers has also been greatly reduced, so farming must be greatly affected, and the food panic will be further strengthened. However, self-sufficiency in staple food is the greatest resource for a country's economy, otherwise it will be heavily dependent on foreign supply. What's more, the total value of Japan's annual food imports has reached about 100 to 200 million yuan. If this continues, it will inevitably have a serious impact on the economy, which will in turn cause great social unrest.</p>
<p>Chemical resources: Chemical resources are not only important in general industrial uses, but also indispensable for the manufacture of explosives and toxic gases. Although Japan has a large amount of sulfur, it cannot supply the wartime needs for chemical products such as industrial salt, resin, alcohol, phosphate rock, soda, and fertilizer. Taking industrial salt as an example, Japan needs about 1 million tons of industrial salt per year, and about 80% of it must rely on imports, most of which comes from Italian Somaliland, followed by Egypt and Kwantung. In addition, soda and alcohol are extremely scarce, and 150,000 tons need to be imported each year, so the value of the materials imported each year reaches more than 15 million yuan.</p>
<p>Fiber resources: Fiber resources are also closely related to military needs both directly and indirectly, but Japan feels a lack of major fiber resources such as cotton, wool, wood pulp, and linen, and even 90% or more of them must rely on imports. Japan has almost no domestic production of cotton, and it all depends on imports from the United States, India, China, Egypt, and other places. Wool is imported from Australia, New Zealand, and other places. Wood pulp is imported from the United States, Norway, Finland, and other places. (The annual consumption of wood pulp reaches 882,000 tons, and only 60,000 tons are produced in Japan and Manchuria, and most of this raw material is supplied to papermaking.) When fiber resources cause panic, it will not only destroy the foundation of Japan's light industry, but also have a great impact on the manufacture of military industries.</p>
<p>In addition, the annual demand for rubber is more than 50 million yuan, of which 47% is imported from the Straits Settlements, and 23% is imported from the Dutch East Indies. The raw materials for the leather industry are extremely lacking in Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Sakhalin, and the annual demand is about 30 million catties, of which 20 million catties must rely on imports, supplied by China, Manchuria, the United States, and South American countries.</p>
<p>In short, Japan's most difficult resources are cotton, wool in the textile industry, and oil and iron ore in the military industry. These resources are the lifeblood of Japan's national economy. A reduction or interruption in the source will inevitably make Japan unable to continue the war. Recently, the United States has implemented an embargo on oil and iron to Japan, which has had a greater impact on Japan's war industry. Therefore, under the conditions of Japan's continuing war and consumption, Japan's collapse or demise is an economic inevitability, which can be asserted.</p>

<h3>Financial Commentary</h3>
<p>— Saint Kai Qiong</p>
<p>— September 28th —</p>
<p>If the United States seeks to stabilize the exchange rate of the Chinese currency, in order to develop trade between China and the United States, then Song's 25 million US dollars will inevitably be allocated to the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund account. The United States must participate in the operation of the fund to control the activities of black market speculators and stabilize the exchange rate of the Chinese currency. Whether this will lead to cooperation between China and the United States in stabilizing the Chinese currency is difficult to predict. However, if the United States truly hopes that China will resist Japan in order to contain its actions in the South Pacific, then financial cooperation, we cannot say, is just an illusion arising from the need to supply 25 million US dollars in foreign exchange.</p>
<p>In fact, in any case, the establishment of the new Sino-US loan is a major blow to foreign exchange speculators. Whether it is used to stabilize the black market of the Chinese currency or to give speculators a head start, it is used for the economic construction of the anti-Japanese war in Free China. Because the stronger China's wartime economic power is, the more solid the foundation of the Chinese currency is, and the stronger the value of the Chinese currency is, then foreign exchange speculators who hope that the value of the Chinese currency will develop unfavorably will inevitably be frustrated. This is self-evident.</p>
<p>It is said that among the banks in Shanghai, two large commercial banks, due to the difficulty of operation and the reason for preparing their own funds, are unwilling to bear the interest on deposits and will reduce the interest rate on current deposits, which will be implemented from October 1st. I remember that before the war, the Chinese government hoped that the banking industry would reduce interest rates to revitalize industry and commerce, but the banking industry hoped that the government would lead the implementation on the front, but on the back, it solemnly said that the banking industry had high deposit interest rates due to cost reasons, and loan interest rates had to be high. If loan interest rates were to be reduced, deposit interest rates had to be reduced first. This secretly indicated to the government that if the government had a way to reduce deposit interest rates, bank loan interest rates would naturally be reduced. China is a country of high interest rates, so reducing interest rates is just talk. Unexpectedly, after the three-year war between China and Japan, two large commercial banks in Shanghai automatically reduced deposit interest rates without the leadership of the government!</p>
<p>At this time and place, what impact will the banking industry's reduction of deposit interest rates have on the anti-Japanese war economy? Let us leave it aside for discussion. However, in the author's intuition, the Shanghai banking industry, instead of only having passive measures and calculating the interests and losses of one industry, why not recognize the times and actively plan some contributions that are beneficial to the country? We must know that passive measures have more destructive components, while active facilities have more constructive components. The author uses "interest rate reduction and internal transfer of funds" to criticize the Shanghai banking industry.</p>
<p>Among the Shanghai banking industry, the enlightened bankers have not made contributions to the country's wartime finance during the war, such as supplementary measures to stabilize finance, such as strengthening the use of the remittance system, etc. After three years of anti-Japanese resistance, bankers should strive to work hard for the country and quickly seek the internal transfer of funds immediately after the interest rate reduction. The original way to use Shanghai current deposits was for the banking industry to use them in the speculative market, or for depositors to speculate directly. Originally, they did not pay attention to the annual interest rate of 3% or 3%, but prayed for speculative profits to be multiples, tenths, or the minimum percentage. Now that the bank suddenly reduces 1%, it makes speculators think that deposit interest is better than speculative interest, and those who do not speculate in current deposits also have the idea of engaging in speculation to make a living. Therefore, if there is no way to absorb these funds and make them move inward and invest in economic construction related to the anti-Japanese war, it will inevitably expand the trend of speculation and obliterate the concept of investment.</p>
<p>Free China is working hard on the thrift and national construction savings movement. The Hong Kong branch of a certain commercial bank that decided to follow up with the interest rate reduction is also selling savings bonds. Although it cannot be sold in Shanghai due to environmental reasons, the author believes that it is possible to change the method and create various investment savings in various names, such as investment in light industry savings, investment in heavy industry savings, etc. After the bank receives this fund, it will immediately remit it to the mainland to purchase national construction savings bonds, or organize various investment groups to seek the internal transfer of funds. However, the former method is better than the latter method, because the national savings bonds are repaid by the state with principal and interest, which is beneficial and harmless; while when organizing investment groups, there are benefits and losses, and it cannot be guaranteed to be beneficial.</p>
<p>I hope that the enlightened bankers in Shanghai will formulate a method and work hard to implement it, so that after the interest rate reduction, it will be followed by the work of absorbing funds. (End)</p>

<h3>Public Concession Traffic Fully Restored Yesterday Morning; French Concession Labor Strike to Begin Negotiations Soon; Yu Qiaqing Hopes for Sincere Cooperation between Labor and Management</h3>
<p>Workers of Shanghai Electric Tramway Co., Ltd. of the Public Concession, China General Omnibus Co., Ltd., and French Electric Tramway Co., Ltd. of the French Concession, successively went on strike to demand improved treatment and conditions. After mediation by Yu Qiaqing and Yuan Ludeng, Chinese directors of the Engineering Bureau, and Gu Bingyuan, director of the conciliation of the Industrial Section, the British Electric Tramway Co., Ltd. and China General Omnibus Co., Ltd. have signed a complete and satisfactory settlement. All trams, trolley buses, and buses on all routes have been fully restored to operation yesterday morning. The striking workers of the two companies have resumed work under the protection of detectives. The treatment conditions proposed by the workers of the French Electric Tramway Co., Ltd. will soon be directly negotiated. Trams on routes 2, 7, and 10 are still barely maintained under the protection of armed police.</p>
<p>Traffic on All Routes Restored to Original State</p>
<p>After the strike of workers of the British Electric Tramway Co., Ltd. and China General Omnibus Co., Ltd. was resolved by Yu Qiaqing and others, the labor union urgently notified the workers to resume work. The company arranged schedules and dispatched vehicles. Starting at 4:00 a.m. yesterday, the early shift workers reported to various places as usual to resume work. In order to protect the workers from resuming work, the public concession police stations specially dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to various places to be on guard. The order of the workers of the two companies to resume work was very good, and no incidents occurred. All trams, trolley buses, and buses on all routes have been fully restored to operation, and the traffic in the Public Concession has been completely restored to its original state. However, the British Electric Tramway Co., Ltd. decided to temporarily stop driving into the French Concession until the labor strike of the French Electric Tramway Co., Ltd. is satisfactorily resolved, such as trolley buses on routes 17 and 18 to Da World, trolley buses on route 24 to Seymour Road and Foch Road, and trams on route 5 to Dongxin Bridge.</p>
<p>Public Bus Agreement Original Text</p>
<p>Conditions signed by labor and management after the strike of workers of the British China General Omnibus Co., Ltd. was resolved through mediation: (1) The company agrees that, starting from September 1, 1940, all Chinese employees will be entitled to a special living allowance of 35 cents per person per day, except during the period of worker absence or dismissal. During sick leave, half of this allowance will be given. (2) If all workers resume work uniformly on Sunday morning, September 29, 1940, one day's wages will be given separately during the strike period. (3) The payment of the pension regulations once contained the stipulation that if a worker participates in a strike, the pension will be cancelled. If the company strictly enforces it, most of the company's workers who have served for many years will suffer greatly. Although this is due to an accident, the company still intends not to cancel this pension. (4) The company agrees that all Chinese employees will receive double pay during the strike of tram workers in the Public Concession until the labor strike is resolved. (5) The company agrees not to dismiss workers without sufficient reason in the future. (6) Regarding the 23 requirements, the company has already replied on September 5, and now reiterates its main points as follows: (A) All employees shall have one special leave day for every nine days of work, with full pay (refer to the workers' management method of the Transportation Department). (B) All employees who are given sick leave by the company's doctor (except for venereal diseases and those who are sick due to their own negligence) will be entitled to half pay plus half-price rice allowance, but each time shall not exceed 30 days, and shall not exceed 60 days per year. (C) Employees may take the company's routes 5 and 10 for free, and those wearing uniforms may take all routes, but no more than three people may ride at the same time. (D) The salary of long-term workers shall be calculated monthly and daily. The above conditions will take effect on Sunday morning, September 29, 1940, after all workers have resumed work. If the workers cannot resume work on time, all agreements will be cancelled.</p>
<p>French Concession Labor Strike to Enter Negotiations</p>
<p>After the workers of the French Electric Tramway Co., Ltd. went on strike on the 25th of this month, the workers proposed a total of 16 conditions for improving treatment, which have been formally submitted to the company by representatives appointed by the labor union by letter. The company has translated them into French and handed them over to the General Office and the director of the Transportation Department to study them one by one, and will soon enter negotiations. As for the company's plan to maintain traffic within the concession, trams on routes 2, 7, and 10 were still barely operated under the protection of armed police yesterday. It is heard that Yu Qiaqing and others, after accepting the request of the workers of the French Electric Tramway Co., Ltd., have ordered the workers to first negotiate directly with the company, and then Lao Qiaqing will personally take the post of mediator when necessary, and hope that both labor and management will negotiate in good faith in the spirit of past cooperation to seek a reasonable solution as soon as possible, so as to avoid the expansion of the labor strike affecting the entire traffic and local security. It is heard that the strike committee has appealed to all sectors of society, hoping to provide sympathetic assistance.</p>
<p>Add Vehicles to Facilitate Passengers</p>
<p>According to She Wen She, after the ticket sales strike in the French Concession, the company authorities specially allocated several trams on routes 1, 2, 7, and 10 to run on each route in order to maintain traffic. According to a reporter from She Wen She, the number of trams running has been increasing day by day. Yesterday, a total of 35 locomotives and 19 trailers were dispatched, which is a considerable increase compared to the 23 trams and 13 trailers maintained on the first day of the strike. The company has set the total number of vehicles for today at 40 and 20 trailers to operate and carry passengers. According to the company, it may be able to fully resume operation tomorrow. Although the labor strike has not been resolved, the workers in the factory are sufficient to work on trams on various routes. There are more than 700 ticket sellers and 350 drivers in the company, and more than 400 people have entered the factory one after another. A reporter learned that after the strike, the homes of four drivers and ticket sellers who did not participate in the strike had been broken into by striking workers and debris was destroyed. About 30 workers who caused disturbances were arrested by the French police.</p>
<p>Huge Losses During Strike Period</p>
<p>A reporter from New Voice She learned from various companies yesterday that the workers of the British Electric Tramway Co., Ltd., China General Omnibus Co., Ltd., and French Electric Tramway Co., Ltd. suffered heavy losses due to the shutdown of vehicles during the strike. (1) The British Electric Tramway Co., Ltd. has a total of 250 trams and trolley buses, and the average daily income from September 21 to 28, a total of nine days, is about 28,000 yuan, which is calculated to be 252,000 yuan. (2) The British Public Automobile Company has a total of 150 public automobiles, and the average daily income from September 24 to 28, a total of five days, is calculated to be 24,000 yuan, and the loss is 120,000 yuan. (3) The French Electric Tramway Company has a total of 140 trams and public automobiles. Except for a part of the trams that are barely operating, the public automobiles and trolley buses are all stopped. So far, it has not been satisfactorily resolved, and the company's losses are countless.</p>
<h3>US Admiral Hepburn in Shanghai Watches Far East Situation and Keeps in Touch with Washington at Any Time, and Adheres to Established Policies on Defense Zone Affairs</h3>
<p>Since the British troops withdrew from the Central District of the Public Concession, the defense duties left behind have been temporarily undertaken by the Volunteer Corps, which has been more than a month now. Recently, local residents have become increasingly concerned about the situation in the Far East, which is becoming more serious, and hope that the US troops will take over defense as soon as possible. According to a reporter from Pingming She, Admiral Hepburn has held several talks with US Consul General Patrick, Rear Admiral Glassford, Commander of the US Yangtze River Fleet, and Colonel Baker, Commander of the US Garrison in Shanghai, on the issue of taking over defense since he arrived in Shanghai, but the content is kept secret and never disclosed to the outside world.</p>
<p>Watching the Entire Far East Situation</p>
<p>Yesterday, it was reported by authoritative sources that Hepburn's mission in Shanghai this time is not only to take over the defense of the Central District, but also to maintain close contact with the US government in Washington on the entire Far East situation at any time. He will never give in to taking over the defense of the Central District of the Public Concession. As for the Public Concession authorities, before the US troops take over the defense, the Volunteer Corps will continue to maintain it until the end of October, and it is scheduled to convene the US Volunteer Corps again from 6:00 p.m. tonight (30th) to defend the Hongkou West District.</p>
<p>US Volunteer Corps to Take Over Defense Tonight</p>
<p>It is found that since the US Volunteer Corps temporarily took over the northern part of Area A, the Japanese side initially opposed the non-British troops of the Volunteer Corps taking over the defense. However, the B Company of the US Volunteer Corps once took over the defense for five days from August 30 to September 4. Later, three teams, including the A Company of the British Volunteer Corps, the Light Cavalry, and the Armored Vehicle Team, took turns to take over. The US decision not to abandon its huge assets and rights in the Central District of the Public Concession is evidenced by the US Volunteer Corps taking over the defense again tonight. According to a reporter's reliable information from the authorities, before the US garrison takes over the defense, the US Volunteer Corps will take over the defense of the district from 6:00 p.m. tonight until 6:00 p.m. on the 4th of next month. After that, it will take turns with the British Volunteer Corps to undertake the defense of the district. The next period is from the 15th to the 19th of next month.</p>
<h3>Thrift and Savings, and Advocate Micro-Donations for Winter Clothing, Issue National Savings Commemorative Stamps</h3>
<p>The National Day Commemoration on October 10th is approaching in an instant. It has been previously stipulated by the Central Government that no extravagant celebration ceremonies will be held during the Anti-Japanese War period. Therefore, this year, all parts of the country will not expand the celebration. All circles in this city will promote thrift and savings and the movement to collect winter clothing, so as to fulfill the responsibilities of citizens.</p>
<p>Regarding the "National Construction Savings Movement Commemorative Stamps" initiated and printed by the Kunming Postal Administration of the Ministry of Communications, it has been decided to start selling them from October 10th this year. According to a reporter from New Voice She yesterday, the Shanghai Postal Administration has not received the order to sell these stamps, so it is still a question whether they will be sold at that time. It is learned that the design of the stamps is novel and the paper is excellent, which will surely be effective in cultivating the virtue of thrift and promoting national construction savings.</p>
<h3>Former Police Station Patrolman Arrives in England to Join War, Many British Overseas Volunteers to Train in Singapore</h3>
<p>Bao Lai, a former Chinese probationary patrolman of the Engineering Bureau Police Station, who is 21 years old, is the eldest son of Dou Jun, a senior official of the Jianghai Customs. After resigning from his job in Shanghai on May 14 this year, he has now received a letter stating that he has arrived by ship and joined the British Royal Air Force as a pilot. There are also many British overseas Chinese living in China who will leave Shanghai to return to their country to join the army and participate in the Anti-Japanese War. Some have submitted applications to the recruitment office in this city and will be sent to Singapore for centralized training before being incorporated into the regular army to participate in the war.</p>
<h3>US Freighter Exits Wusong Port and Sinks Sailboat, Four People, Including the Boss, Drown, Ship Owner Has Serious Negotiations</h3>
<p>At about 4:00 p.m. the day before yesterday, a Yong-style sailboat, Jin Bei Ping, loaded more than 90 tons of yellow sand from Sijiao to Shanghai for unloading. When entering Wusong Port, when inspected by the port department's martial law ship as usual, a US freighter "Steel Warrior" (transliteration) suddenly drove in from a distance. The Jin Bei Ping failed to avoid it and was violently hit. The ship sank immediately. Seeing the disaster, the freighter drove away quickly. Fortunately, the port department's martial law ship and other sailboats rushed to rescue with small boats and sampans. As a result, in addition to those rescued from the ship, there were still four people, including the boss Wu Jinshan and passengers Zhu Ade, Wang Shanqing, and Sun Jia Hui, who drowned with the ship. The bodies could not be found, and the situation was very tragic. It is now heard that the owner of the Jin Bei Ping is making serious negotiations with the US freighter, demanding compensation for all losses.</p>

<h3>Engineering Bureau Chinese Directors and Committee Members Express Willingness to Serve as Usual and Will Not Give Advice on Unreasonable Threats</h3>
<p>According to the Zilin West News on the 26th of this month, the Chinese directors and committee members of the Engineering Bureau received a threatening letter on the 19th of this month from the so-called Organizing Committee of the Taxpaying Chinese Association in Hongkou, stating that the Chinese directors and committee members were elected by the Taxpaying Chinese Association three years ago, and that no re-election has been held so far, and demanded that each person resign from the position of director and committee member of the Engineering Bureau from the Taxpaying Chinese Association within five days. After verification by reporters, it is true. A certain Chinese director told reporters that such "threatening letters" were received some time ago, and it is not "the most recent such letter was received on the 19th of this month. The Chinese directors and committee members also laughed at it and ignored it. According to the order of the National Government, during the Anti-Japanese War, all public organizations in this city will maintain the status quo before the war, and no re-election will be allowed on the grounds that the Chinese directors and committee members taxpayers continue to elect and re-elect, which is of course completely legal.</p>
<h3>Five Types of Government Bonds to Be Redeemed and Paid Interest Starting Today, Jin Chang to Pay Remittances in Six Installments, and Other Bonds to Be Paid Locally</h3>
<p>In order to maintain credit, the Ministry of Finance has allocated special funds to the Central Bank for the principal and interest of domestic government bonds due, in accordance with the regulations of the principal and interest repayment schedule. A reporter from New Voice She learned from the Central Bank yesterday that the method of redeeming and paying interest on government bonds due at the end of September has been implemented in accordance with the method issued by the Ministry of Finance. (1) The tenth redemption and interest payment of the seventeenth year financial long-term government bond will be paid by the four banks of China, China, Communications, and Agriculture. Shanghai will pay remittances in six installments, which will be paid by the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank and the Shanghai branches of the China and Communications banks entrusted by it. (2) The second interest payment of the first phase of the twenty-eighth year of the Republic of China construction government bond and the third interest payment of the second phase of the twenty-eighth year of the Republic of China military government bond will be paid by the Central Bank in various places starting from September 30, but the Shanghai Central Branch will not pay the interest on these two government bonds. (3) The eighth redemption and interest payment of the Guangdong Financial Government Bond and the seventh redemption and interest payment of the US dollar bond for dredging the Guangdong-Hong Kong River Project will be paid in full by the Central Bank and the Guangdong Provincial Bank starting from September 30, but the Shanghai Central Branch will not handle the payment of these two government bonds.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Gradually Loosens, Rice Industry Orders Foreign Rice, Rice Market is Unstable, Authorities Should Correct It, Shipping Prices Continue to Rise Without Any Solid Reason</h3>
<p>The entire food supply in Shanghai has recently resumed an unstable situation. The prices of domestic and foreign rice have risen frequently again in a short period of time. The highest price of domestic rice has reached a new peak of 90 yuan per stone. However, this trend is definitely due to general hoarding and speculation and manipulation and monopoly. These speculative rice moths are all creating something out of nothing and fabricating right and wrong, which is really not worth a smile from knowledgeable people. However, a small number of rice merchants are moved by it, so they hoard spot goods and try to obtain extra profits, which leads to the entire rice market being tight and loose, and trade is quite difficult. People are crowded, and the market situation is not without chaos, and the relevant rice industry groups in this city have not advised, which really makes the doubts of all sectors difficult to resolve. The Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee also uses the term that it has more than enough heart but not enough strength, and does not advise. However, the frequent rise in rice prices and the proliferation of illegal transactions in the market, the responsibilities of all relevant parties are really important.</p>
<p>Production Prices Decline</p>
<p>It was also learned from various foreign firms that the rise and fall of foreign rice production prices are closely related to the foreign exchange situation. If the foreign exchange is once lengthened, the foreign rice production price will inevitably decline. Recently, due to the gradual decline in the price of gold, the foreign exchange market has gradually loosened, and the foreign rice production price has also decreased slightly compared to the previous days. The detailed price list has not yet been reported by telegram from the various foreign firms. However, it is said that it is not much different from the price determined by the foreign rice evaluation in this city. It is now learned that the various rice industry firms in this city have raised funds for the sake of preparedness and will entrust the French firm Dafu, the British firm Heyi, the Swiss firm Fujia, and the Jianyuan Chinese firm to order a large amount of food rice from the rice production areas of Saigon and Siam by telegram, so as to facilitate the transportation to Shanghai for regulation and to stabilize the entire rice market. It is heard that this batch of unordered foreign rice is planned to be mainly No. 2 Saigon Siam, followed by small twisted, fire twisted, and No. 1 foreign rice, which is said to be a small number. It is heard that the total number is about 150,000 bags. It is also learned that the larger rice firms have directly ordered from Saigon and Siam by telegram. As soon as the transaction is completed, they will hire special ships to transport the rice to Shanghai as soon as possible.</p>

<p>According to Zilin Newspaper, Mao Han, a Chinese merchant and shareholder of Dehe Foreign Firm at No. 20 Jiujiang Road, was driving his own car along Shanzhong Road at 3:00 p.m. on the 28th. In front of the White Russian Church Hospital, he accidentally collided with a tram heading north. Mao Han was seriously injured and was immediately sent to the White Russian Church Hospital for emergency treatment. He died of his injuries one hour later. According to Mao Han, he was from the New Ruin area of ​​England and has been doing business in Shanghai for 22 years. He is survived by a wife who currently lives in Shanghai.

<h3>Japanese Warship Bombards Chuanshan</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang provincial associations in Shanghai yesterday received a telegram from eastern Zhejiang, as follows: (1) Two Japanese warships that were anchored outside Zhenhai Port the day before yesterday, one left at 6:20 this morning, and another Japanese warship sailed in from the north at 6:40. At 10:05, another suddenly sailed southeast. Japanese warships are now cruising back and forth outside Zhenhai Port, but there are no unusual movements. (2) At 10:45 on the morning of the day before yesterday, a Japanese warship sailed from the northwest to the waters off Chuanshan. At 12:40, it suddenly fired five or six shots at Xiashanpu. The shells landed on the sand, causing no loss to us. At 1:54 in the afternoon, the warship headed east, its destination unknown. (3) Also, at 3:20 in the afternoon of the day before yesterday, a Japanese warship sailed from the north to the waters off Shipu. There are now three Japanese warships anchored in the waters off Shipu, but there are no unusual movements. (4) At 7:46 on the morning of the day before yesterday, a sound of machinery was heard from the northwest to northeast of Lihai in Hushan, Yuyao. The Ningbo observation post immediately issued an emergency air raid alert at 7:52. Soon after, two Japanese planes passed over and invaded Zhuji, Shaoxing before fleeing. The alert was lifted at 8:08.</p>
<h3>American Residents in Shanghai Assist Europeans in Shanghai to Contact Their National Organizations and Donate Money and Goods to Aid People of Various Countries</h3>
<p>According to the North-China Daily News, some American residents in Shanghai, noting that many European residents in Shanghai have lost contact with their homelands due to the European war, decided to hold a meeting early this week to establish an organization to assist these European residents in Shanghai to connect with their national organizations in the United Kingdom, the United States and elsewhere. The American residents' organization also intends to provide special assistance to other European resident groups in the city, and to distribute donations of funds and goods to the European resident groups for the relief of their respective nationals.</p>
<h3>Reactions in Shanghai Following the German-Italian-Japanese Alliance</h3>
<p>The military and economic alliance of Germany, Italy, and Japan has now finally come to fruition. Although the government has yet to make a formal statement on this matter, according to general observers, the alliance of Germany, Italy, and Japan has been brewing for a long time, but it is only now being realized. The impact of this move is less on China than on the United Kingdom and the United States. China, on the other hand, will receive increased assistance from the United Kingdom and the United States, allowing the war effort to become stronger. This can be stated with certainty. The opinions of the well-known commentator Mr. Woodhead and foreign observers are presented separately as follows:</p>
<p>Woodhead's Commentary: U.S. Policy Is Firm</p>
<p>The well-known commentator Mr. Woodhead, in the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury" yesterday, gave a summary review of world affairs over the past week. The part about the Far East stated briefly that, although France and Japan have signed an agreement in Hanoi allowing Japanese troops to land in Vietnam, the commander of the Japanese army in South China, Ando, ​​seems to have decided to regard Vietnam as hostile territory. Within hours of the signing of the agreement by Mr. Deguchi and Mr. Nishihara, he violated it. Before the deadline of the Japanese ultimatum had expired, he ignored Nishihara's efforts to limit Japanese military actions to the scope of the agreement, and continued military vehicle operations, occupying Lang Son, bombing Haiphong, and repeatedly attacking the French territory on the Guangxi-Tonkin border. All of these actions resulted in a blatant violation of the Hanoi Agreement.</p>
<p>At the same time, the United States has moved from routine protests to open and practical actions, assisting China's foreign exchange needs with large loans, and imposing an embargo on scrap iron to Japan in mid-October. The U.S. Navy Department is still discussing the issue of borrowing the Singapore base. There are other measures that are sufficient to express the United States' deep displeasure with Japan's actions to disrupt the status quo in the Far East.</p>
<p>As for the so-called "defensive" alliance of Germany, Italy, and Japan, there is no need for us to be shocked by it. In fact, this is a deliberate and hypocritical masterpiece by Ribbentrop and Ciano. For months, it has been obvious that if Japan were to join the war, it would stand on the side of the Axis powers. Why bother with a so-called "alliance"? One article in the alliance agreement stipulates that "if one of the signatory countries is attacked by a country not currently involved in the European War or the Sino-Japanese War, the three countries shall provide mutual assistance in the political, economic, and military spheres."</p>
<p>The provision of this clause is clearly aimed at the United States, but the term "attack" is not defined. Germany has claimed to have been "attacked" by Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Denmark, and now Japan may as well follow suit and claim to have been "attacked" by Vietnam. In any case, this alliance will not have the slightest impact on the United States' increasingly tough Far East policy.</p>
<p>Foreign Observers Discuss U.S. Aid to China</p>
<p>A Pingming News Agency reporter also asked a foreign international observer about the German-Italian-Japanese alliance yesterday. According to his views:</p>
<p>Initially, the United Kingdom, preoccupied with events in Europe, had no time to look to the East. Although Japan took the opportunity to exert pressure, it was unbearable. The United Kingdom adopted a policy of appeasement and willingly retreated. The Tianjin silver issue was just signed, and the blockade of Hong Kong followed. At the same time, the Yunnan-Burma Road was used as a condition for imposing an embargo. As an independent country, it was under no obligation to comply with this unreasonable request, but in order to avoid disputes, it had no choice but to obey and temporarily impose an embargo for three months. This repeated forbearance ultimately led to the alliance of Germany, Italy, and Japan, and to being in opposition. Therefore, it would be necessary to assist China in order to restrain Japan. Regarding the rights and interests previously obtained in the Far East, it was crucial to preserve them. Therefore, the embargo on the Yunnan-Burma Road could be lifted without waiting for its expiration.</p>
<p>As for the United States, although it has always valued justice and has a deep friendship with China, it does not condone the arbitrary actions of aggressive countries to undermine world peace. The resolute abolition of the U.S.-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation and the prohibition of scrap iron exports to Japan are precisely a major blow to Japan, in contrast to the UK's appeasement. It can be seen that the aggressors in the Far East tore up the Nine-Power Treaty, expanded their influence, and that security in the Pacific will inevitably be threatened. Knowing that its own military strength is insufficient to fight the enemy, and that the time may not be so short, it is making every effort to prepare domestically and is contacting countries abroad. Knowing that China will certainly be able to hold back Japan, it is constantly providing spiritual and material assistance. Now that the alliance of Germany, Italy, and Japan has been formed, if it goes further, disaster will inevitably befall the United States itself. If it does not actively assist China, the aggressors will inevitably become more assertive in the future, and there will be a situation that is difficult to suppress. Therefore, after Vietnam allowed Japan to pass through, it immediately lent a large sum of money to China. Now that Germany, Italy, and Japan have allied again, the material assistance in the future will likely not stop there. This can be inferred.</p>
<h3>French Tram Conductor Dies of Serious Injuries; Labor Demands Company Compensation</h3>
<p>Regarding the case of Zhang Yongkang, tram conductor number 527 of the French Tram Company, who was shot and injured during a disturbance on tram line 2 the other day, he died of serious injuries at the Aurora Hospital on Jin Shenfu Road yesterday. All his colleagues were very indignant upon hearing the news. According to a representative of the labor side who spoke to the reporter of the Xin Sheng News Agency yesterday, the strike committee has decided to visit Mr. Yu Qiaqing, a Chinese director of the Municipal Council, again this morning to request that he serve as a mediator. The company should provide generous compensation for the deceased Zhang Yongkang.</p>

<h3>Japan Discriminates Against Third-Country Commerce; UK and U.S. Protest; Japan Cancels Oil Sales Permits, Handing Them Over to Japanese Companies</h3>
<p>Asiatic Petroleum, Standard Oil, and Texaco, which sell kerosene and gasoline in Central China, have had to obtain permits from the Japanese military in order to operate. Applications for permits were previously handled by the Japanese Oil Merchants Association. Since mid-July, the Association, under orders from the military, has stopped issuing permits and handed over the business to the Japanese company, Merii Petroleum, which is a blatant discrimination against third-country commerce. The UK and U.S. have lodged serious protests.</p>

The measures stipulate that all designated prohibited imported commercial goods should cease to be sold three months after the date of implementation of the measures. Those that have not been sold by the expiration date shall be purchased by the Trade Commission or its designated agencies at a price for foreign residents in China to purchase for their own use, or be received by government agencies at a price for the needs of entertaining foreign guests. If they are not handed over to the Trade Commission after the expiration date and are still sold or transferred, they shall be confiscated. Some luxury goods were designated first for implementation, and other goods will be designated for implementation in stages when necessary.</p>
<p>List of All Banned Goods</p>
<p>The list of banned goods that should cease to be sold from October 1 is as follows: 1. Foreign cigars, cigarettes, and tobacco; 2.

<h3>Two Gunshots in the Dark; Japanese Officer Slightly Injured; Rickshaw Puller Shot in Right Arm; Special Martial Law North of the Suzhou Creek</h3>
<p>At about 9:30 last night, several Chinese and a Japanese officer in civilian clothes hired rickshaws at the Sika Bridge in Hongkou. When they were passing through the intersection of Haining Road, Beisichuan Road, and Tiantong Road, there were two gunshots in the dark. The bullets flew out and grazed the right ear of the Japanese officer on the last rickshaw, causing a skin wound. The rickshaw puller, Cao Jinlian, was shot in the right arm, and blood flowed down. The rickshaw puller was sent to the Tongren Hospital for treatment by an Indian constable No. 98 of the Hongkou Police Department. After the incident, the Japanese side considered the situation serious and immediately dispatched several marines, who were stationed at various intersections, such as the intersections of Haining Road and Fusheng Road, Laobazi Road, and Beisichuan Road. Four Japanese soldiers were stationed at each location to search pedestrians. The Waibaidu Bridge, the Second Baidu Bridge, the Jiangxi Road Bridge, and the Pintang Lane Bridge were all blocked and closed, and pedestrians were not allowed to pass. At the same time, a strict investigation was conducted around the scene of the incident to find the gunman.</p>
<h3>Bandits Hijack Commuting Car, Kidnap Seven-Year-Old Child; Son of Rice Shop Owner Kidnapped Yesterday Afternoon; Hijacked Car Found Afterwards</h3>
<p>A kidnapping case occurred suddenly on Xiaoshadu Road in western Shanghai at 1:37 p.m. yesterday. The kidnapped person was Wu Chengrong (nicknamed Yuangen), the young owner of a rice shop, who was only seven years old. Three kidnappers rented a commuting car from the Haig Road Silver Car Company in advance, drove to the rice shop, hugged the child into the car, and sped away. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Child Kidnapped</p>
<p>Wu Yutang, 52 years old, from Pudong, runs the Tongfaxiang Nanhuo Rice Shop at No. 1420 to 1426 Xiaoshadu Road in western Shanghai. It is a four-room shop. Unexpectedly, at 1:37 p.m. yesterday, Wu was handling accounts in the shop when three kidnappers suddenly appeared, all wearing short clothes. One person was on the lookout outside the door, and the remaining two broke open the iron gate and rushed in. Each took out a Mauser pistol. First, one bandit broke into the shop and monitored Wu and four or five shop assistants. The other bandit walked into the back room and went straight into the bedroom. At that time, his wife, Mrs. Su, was sleeping, and a maid was playing with three children on a small couch. The bandit pulled out his gun and shouted loudly. Mrs. Su woke up from her dream and quickly got out of bed. Seeing that the man was holding a Mauser pistol, she knew that he was not a good person and did not dare to speak. The bandit then took the child Chengrong (nicknamed Yuangen) from the small couch, carried him to the entrance of No. 1418, which was adjacent to the south, and put him in a Silver commuting car No. 18257, and drove south and west. His whereabouts are unknown. Afterwards, the shop owner Wu Yutang reported the incident to the Putuo Road Police Station and asked for investigation.</p>
<p>Bandits Hijack Car</p>
<p>It is reported that at about 1:10 p.m. yesterday, two customers suddenly came to the Silver Car Main Station at No. 358 Haig Road, one wearing a long gown and the other wearing short clothes, and came to hire a car. The driver, Chen Yanfa, a local, drove car No. 18257 to the intersection of Yidingpan Road and Kainar Road in western Shanghai. At that time, the two people in the car took out guns and claimed that they needed to borrow the car for a while, stripped off his uniform and hat, and drove Chen away. After hijacking the car, the bandits went to Xiaoshadu Road to kidnap the child Wu Yuangen. At about 4:30, the car was found on Kangnaot Road and Yanping Road. The sentry informed the company and ordered someone to go and claim it. It is said that Wu has three children: the eldest son, Tanggen, is 14 years old and is studying at Aiguang Primary School in Hongshoufang on the same road; the second son, Yuangen, is 7 years old and is in the first grade of Shanghai Primary School in Caoxiebang nearby; and the daughter, Mingyue, is only 6 years old and has not yet attended school.</p>
<h3>Daylight Robbery on Laobazi Road; Large Sum of Money Robbed; Dragged into Car and Thrown Out After Robbery</h3>
<p>At 1:45 p.m. yesterday on Laobazi Road in Hongkou, six bandits, two of whom were armed, stopped a pedestrian, prohibited him from shouting, and forcibly dragged him into a certain car parked on the side of the road, speeding east. When they drove to the intersection of Laobazi Road and Beisichuan Road, they threw the person out of the car and fled without a trace. A total of 45,000 yuan in cash was robbed from him. Afterwards, he reported the incident to the Hongkou Police Department and asked them to investigate.</p>
<h3>Descendants of Zhou Fu Jiu Litigate Over Estate; Manager of Yuda Bank Summoned to Testify; Rescheduled for Trial on the 18th</h3>
<p>The estate of the late salt merchant Zhou Fuju, totaling 20 million yuan, was inherited by his five sons, and the Zhou Wuchang Hall was established to manage the common property of the five sons. Zhou's fifth son was named Cai Cheng, who died of illness in 1923. Cai Cheng's wife also died of illness in 1926, leaving behind a son named Zhou Pengling, who was only eight years old at the time. Therefore, the property that his father and he himself should have inherited was at the disposal of others.</p>
<p>Private Movable Property of Pengling's Father</p>
<p>At that time, it was inspected and sealed by relatives and friends, totaling 301 boxes, which were stored separately in various rooms. Initially, 39 boxes were entrusted to the eldest son for safekeeping, and the boxes kept by the other sons were also transferred to the eldest son for safekeeping. Pengling is now 22 years old. Because he has no money for tuition, he plans to sell his father's fur clothes to use as tuition. Therefore, last year, he asked Zhou Meiyi Hui (wife of Zhou Zishan, eldest grandson of Zhou Fuju), the property manager of the eldest son, to return</p>
<p>Stored Fur Clothes</p>
<p>23 boxes, valued at 240,000 yuan in national currency. However, Zhou Mei replied evasively. Zhou Pengling has had no results with peaceful negotiations, and recently retained lawyer Dan Yuhua to file a lawsuit in the Civil Court of the First Special Court, requesting that the defendant Zhou Meishihui be ordered to return 13 boxes of fur clothes. Because the litigation target is as high as 240,000, the litigation fee was only recently paid in full. The court accepted the complaint, and judge Guo summoned him to the Second Civil Court the other day. According to the plaintiff's complaint, the plaintiff's father Zhou Caicheng owed</p>
<p>Yuda Bank</p>
<p>debts during his lifetime, which have been repaid by the Wuchang Hall's public account. The defendant Zhou Mei falsely claimed that her late husband Zhou Shanshan had privately repaid the debt owed by the plaintiff's father to the Yuda Bank, and used 18 boxes of fur clothes as collateral. The defendant now owns millions of assets, but she is using this sleight of hand to try to embezzle the 23 boxes of fur clothes that a lonely young man like the plaintiff is relying on for his studies. In law and in reason,</p>
<p>It cannot be tolerated</p>
<p>However, according to the defendant Zhou Mei's defense, she insisted that the stored fur clothes were indeed used to repay the debt owed to the Yuda Bank. Subsequently, Peng Boqian of the Wuchang Hall's liquidation office testified that the Wuchang Hall had repaid more than 30,000 taels of silver to the Yuda Bank on behalf of Zhou Caicheng. Witness Zeng Duhui also testified that the plaintiff Zhou Pengling had previously auctioned off eight boxes, which he had recorded. The court questioned both parties and witnesses in detail for a long time, and considered it necessary to summon Tian Yushu, the manager of the Yuda Bank. Therefore, it was ordered to postpone the hearing to October 8.</p>
<h3>Boiling Dangerous Oil Materials; Death of Two People; Verdict; Yuan Bingzheng Sentenced for Manslaughter; Civil Lawsuit Transferred to Civil Court for Trial</h3>
<p>Yuan Bingzheng, a shareholder of the Taichang Tarpaulin Shop at No. 225 Tokyo Road, and Zhou, a major shareholder who is on the run, instructed an apprentice from Jiangbei, Zhe Afa (17 years old), to put flammable materials such as paint, beeswax, and gasoline in a pot and boil them on a coal stove to make glue for wiping tarpaulin at 9:10 a.m. on the 7th of this month. Due to carelessness, it overturned and caused a fire, resulting in the burning of the two buildings of the tarpaulin shop.</p>
<p>Houses Burned Down</p>
<p>The apprentice Xin and Chen Youfa's six-year-old daughter, Meiji, were killed in the accident. The Chinese and Western detectives of the Gordon Road Police Station arrested Yuan and escorted him to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. Later, the Chinese Police Station found that the Taichang Tarpaulin Shop had fire insurance of nearly 6,000 yuan, which seemed to have deliberately</p>
<p>Dangerous Fuel; Instructed apprentice Xin to boil it on the coal stove, causing the disaster. The police station hired a fuel expert to test whether the above materials could be boiled on a coal stove. It was found that gasoline could not be added. The landlord Wang and Meiji's father, Chen Youfa, requested compensation for losses, maintenance fees, consolation money, and</p>
<p>Funeral expenses, etc.</p>
<p>totaling 4,161 yuan in the civil lawsuit. The police station's lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, requested a severe punishment to warn others not to do the same, disregarding human life. After the final debate, they waited for the sentence. Judge Jiang Shuzi came to court yesterday and sentenced Yuan Bingzheng to one year of imprisonment for causing death by negligence. The attached civil lawsuit was transferred to the Civil Court of this court for trial.</p>
<h3>Four Robbers Charged with Robbery and Extortion</h3>
<p>The criminal robbers Hu Kouxi and Yang Shiwen from Anhui, Wang Jiajin from Tongzhou, and in Amao etc from Ningbo, wrote threatening letters between the 13th and 27th of this month and delivered them to Wu Shaowu, the owner of the Lichengxing Canning Factory at No. 318 Baoding Road, demanding 50,000 yuan unsuccessfully. They also robbed lead bars and lead skins worth more than 500 yuan, and robbed Qiao Xiaolai of more than 100 yuan in cash at No. 6 Tangshan Road. The case was investigated and the Chinese and Western detectives of the Huishan Police Station arrested them. Judge Huang Risheng came to court yesterday to continue the trial. The police station's lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, filed a lawsuit on charges of robbery and writing threatening letters to extort money, requesting a severe punishment. The court appointed lawyer Jiang Rong to provide free legal aid once, and then ordered them to be returned to custody to await sentencing.</p>
<h3>French Tram Conductor Suddenly Disappears</h3>
<p>Li Shengyong from Pudong has been a conductor for the French Tram Company for more than ten years and has a long history. He has now been promoted to chief conductor and his monthly salary has also increased to 130 yuan. He has always worked diligently and has been deeply trusted by the company. During the strike by workers of the French Water and Electricity Tram Company to demand wage increases and improved treatment, the company, under the strict protection of the police authorities, selectively dispatched vehicles to run on various routes to maintain transportation, and Li Shengyong worked even harder, which caused jealousy. On the morning of the 26th of this month, Li went from home to the company to work and disappeared en route. It is said that Li was kidnapped. So far, there is no news or trace of him. His family is very anxious and reported the incident to the company, which in turn reported it to the police authorities, who sent personnel to visit and investigate Li's whereabouts.</p>
<h3>Book "Human Change" Reported by Political Department</h3>
<p>In the case of the Zhou Qinji and Zhou Qixiang brothers killing their father Zhou Yongjie and attempting to dismember the body to destroy the evidence, the court sentenced Qinji and Qixiang to death in two trials, and the deceased's wife, Mrs. Jing, was sentenced to two years and six months in prison for aiding and abetting. Now, the Huaguang Communications Agency at No. 44 Yunnan Road, etc., has printed a detailed novel about the case, titled "Human Change," which has been published. The Political Department of the Public Concession believes that this book promotes crime and has reported it to the Legal Department for review and prosecution in accordance with the Publishing Law. After reviewing the case, the lawyers of the Legal Department, such as Ru Baoyi, determined that the book "Human Change" did not violate the provisions of the Publishing Law, and did not harm good morals or disrupt public order. The contents recorded were the facts of the entire case and the lives of the characters, and some of them had been published in newspapers. Therefore, it could not be determined that it promoted crime, and it was decided not to prosecute and the original case was returned to the Political Department.</p>

<p>Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation</p>
<h3>The Rules to Abide by in Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation</h3>
<p>— Qiu Lang</p>
<p>In these extraordinary times, especially for the salaried class, maintaining these four essential elements of "clothing, food, housing, and transportation" is indeed not easy! Therefore, for these four elements, we must not only be frugal but also abide by rules. In our interactions with others, we should be strict with ourselves and lenient with others, emphasizing etiquette and maintaining a humble and gentle demeanor. I dare not use moralistic language to exhort the masses, but it can at least avoid many disputes.</p>
<p>Clothing: In this difficult era, we should advocate wearing old clothes. Wearing old clothes is not shameful, as long as they are washed and kept clean, and folded neatly. Shoes and hats should be brushed free of dust regularly. When dressing, hats should be worn straight, and buttons should be fastened. We should also instruct our children to do the same, as I often see people who are well-dressed themselves but neglect their families and children, which easily leads to being looked down upon and criticized.</p>
<p>Food: In social gatherings, celebrations, and condolences, it is always appropriate to be humble when using chopsticks during banquets. Limit alcohol consumption to a maximum of eight parts out of ten. Never be too greedy, wolf down food, or get drunk! The host may not feel comfortable speaking out, but it greatly annoys other guests! Overeating is also harmful to oneself. Even in daily meals, eat vegetables before meat, do not reach across the table indiscriminately, and do not take more than your share. This avoids making colleagues uncomfortable and sets a good example for the family.</p>
<p>Housing: Speaking of housing, it is common for several families to live in one house during this time of soaring housing prices. However, when sharing housing for economic reasons, mutual humility is most important! Each family should have the mindset that "taking a loss is a gain," and be willing to give way to others, which will naturally lead to peaceful coexistence. However, there are many disputes among cohabitants, all because they cannot understand each other, leading to arguments. Sometimes, children's mischief can also cause trouble, in which case adults should blame their own children to show reasonableness, and the dispute will subside.</p>
<p>Transportation: Human beings have two legs, and their function is to walk. Regular walking can promote blood circulation and strengthen muscles and bones. It is both economical and hygienic. However, lazy people must use cars instead of walking, considering it more dignified not to exert themselves. You must know that in these times, we should be diligent and endure hardship. What does walking a little way matter! However, if the distance is far or there is an urgent matter, we must rely on cars. We should also take cheaper public buses and trams, and give way to women and children when boarding and alighting. We should also let them sit first when the bus is crowded. This is what we should do in terms of reason.</p>
<h3>The Key Points of Children's Clothing</h3>
<p>— Yun Lin</p>
<p>Children's clothing has a significant impact on their health. The following are the points that must be noted for parents' reference.</p>
<p>(A) Fabric of the clothes: (1) It should be soft, (2) It should be absorbent, (3) It should be smooth and not irritate the skin, (4) It should be easy to wash.</p>
<p>(B) Colors of the clothes: Clothes absorb external temperature differently depending on the color. Colored clothes absorb more than white clothes. Furthermore, many dyes in clothing contain irritating pigments such as antimony, arsenic, lead, copper, mercury, zinc, and aniline. If these pigments adhere to the body, they can sometimes inflame children's delicate skin.</p>
<p>(C) Style of the clothes: Because children's bodies are not fully developed, all parts appear very weak. Therefore, all sizes and styles should be loose and not too tight.</p>
<p>(D) Skin secretions excrete waste from the body, so clothes should be absorbent to absorb dirt and not accumulate on the body.</p>
<h3>A Discussion on Lunch</h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>Everyone values the issue of eating. No wonder the ancients had the saying "The people regard food as heaven." In our ordinary lives, we mostly have three meals a day. That is, we have some snacks in the morning and two meals at noon and in the evening. I have a small discussion about lunch, believing that snacks should be eaten at noon and meals in the morning. What is the reason for this? Allow me to explain below.</p>
<p>Didn't Ziyu氏 say: "　飱而治"? Note: "Cooked food. 朝曰　, 夕曰飱," It can be seen that the ancients originally ate meals in the morning. Why do I only mention morning and evening and not noon? To this day, we still follow this habit, calling what we eat in the morning breakfast. Some country folk actually get up and eat breakfast in the morning. However, they eat meals again at five o'clock and in the evening. I remember one year when I went to Lili, a town in the Suzhou countryside, to attend a wedding feast. I stayed there for many days. They had snacks in the morning, calling it breakfast, and called lunch snacks instead. On the first day, they prepared lunch, but the servant came to invite me to have snacks. I didn't understand, so I replied that I had already had snacks. The servant laughed and said that snacks here meant lunch. Only then did I suddenly realize, and I couldn't help but laugh. From this, it can be seen that eating snacks at noon and meals in the morning must have been around for a long time. Later, only the name remained, and the reality was not pursued. If we can really eat meals in the morning, then every household will naturally follow Zhu Bailu's creed of "getting up at dawn," buying vegetables, cooking rice. After filling their stomachs, they go to work. At noon, they only need to prepare some bread or biscuits. In less than ten minutes, a lunch is solved. Wouldn't that save a lot of time and increase work efficiency? Furthermore, high-ranking officials, such as managers, big bosses, bank presidents, and compradors, do not need to drive motorcycles back home at noon, eat, and then drive motorcycles back to work. Several gallons of gasoline can be saved each month. If one person does this, and it is extended to a place and a country, the total will definitely be surprising. Material resources, financial resources, and human resources are saved, which is very beneficial to the anti-Japanese resistance, isn't it? Those middle and lower-level employees do not have to go outside to find small restaurants or diners to eat cheap meals, and they do not have to trudge through rain and snow. In terms of time allocation, assuming that dinner is eaten at six o'clock in the evening and breakfast is eaten at seven o'clock the next morning, it is a total of thirteen hours. After this long period of time, the stomach is empty, so it is more appropriate to eat a solid meal. If snacks are eaten in the morning, lunch is eaten at twelve o'clock, and dinner is eaten at six o'clock in the evening, there are only six hours from twelve o'clock to six o'clock. It would be too uneven to eat two meals during this time. Some people say that they often cannot eat when they get up in the morning. What should be done about this? I believe that this is due to not being accustomed to it. If it can be practiced regularly, then it will become natural, and there will be no difficulty. I believe that this issue is more practical than the summer daylight saving time, and it is not limited to the season, but can be implemented all year round.</p>
<h3>The Difficulty of Traveling</h3>
<p>— Sui Zhen</p>
<p>Clothing, food, housing, and transportation are the four essential elements of life. Now, apart from clothing, food, and housing, which have already suffered serious threats, the element of "transportation" has recently encountered the biggest trouble. The recent strikes by tram and bus workers are an example. From a general perspective, each side has its own standpoint, which cannot be criticized too harshly. However, those of us in the salaried class come into contact with trams or buses almost every day. Since the successive strikes, black-plated cars have always been out of reach, and we cannot afford business cars either. The cost of one trip is three or four yuan. The reward for a day's hard work is only that much, so we dare not even dream of it. Then, to have something stable, fast, cheap, and all-inclusive, we can only ask rickshaws for help. But it is shameful to say that the arrogance of rickshaw pullers has risen above ours in the past few days. The prices they demand are high, and their attitude is tough, just like when we moved from the Nanshi to the concession during the "August 13th" incident. This really makes people not know what to do. But the time to go to the office is fixed, and being late will result in a painful deduction of salary. In desperation, I had to trouble my two legs, on which I have relied all my life. Although these size eleven "cars" cannot be compared with eight-cylinder sedans, roads must be walked. If you are determined to walk, and you have identified the direction, there will eventually be a time when you arrive. The path of life and the success of learning and career are no exception. As the saying goes: "Sincerity can penetrate metal and stone." This is an exaggeration compared to walking, but it is not an exaggeration to describe my or most people's mood at the time. It just so happened that it was drizzling that morning, and the asphalt road was particularly slippery. It took a full hour to walk from Connaught Road to Jiangxi Road, which was like the line in Peking opera, "Galloping all night." I barely made it to the office in a state of panic. Looking back, the edge of my long gown was covered in mud, and I was drenched in sweat. Before I could catch my breath, I started working, and I didn't have time to think about anything else. It wasn't until dusk that I stumbled back home. Looking at the pedestrians on the road, although it wasn't as lively as in the past, the various private cars in front of the ××× Theater and the ×× Restaurant were still lined up in a long snake-like formation, looking majestic and beautiful. I thought that they could get the highest material enjoyment. By contrast, they could be considered the darlings of heaven. As I walked and pondered slowly, a streamlined sedan suddenly came from behind and sped past like lightning. Before I could dodge, I was splashed with mud. Looking closely, the car had already gone far. A dog's head was still sticking out of the car window. Needless to say, it must have been a ××× breed pet dog raised by the car owner. I was indignant and felt that my legs were a little sore. So I lowered my head and continued forward, enduring until I got home, already exhausted. I hurriedly took off my dirty clothes and fell asleep.</p>
<p>The night enveloped the earth. The radio upstairs and the sound of mahjong downstairs were deafening. In addition, the rustling autumn rain outside the window, mixed with a few bursts of cold air, brought together all kinds of sorrows. Thoughts surged in my mind, and I couldn't fall asleep. I reached for a book of Tang poetry for entertainment. After flipping through a few pages, I read an ancient poem, "The Road to Shu Is Difficult." I couldn't help but throw down the book and deeply sighed, "The difficulty of traveling."</p>
<h3>Utilizing Waste</h3>
<p>— Jian Hua</p>
<p>After reading Mr. Zi Fang's "Methods of Utilizing Old Socks" in the issue of the 26th of last month, according to what the author knows, in addition to what Mr. Zi Fang mentioned, there are several other utilization methods, which are written below:</p>
<p>(1) Making shoe sole thread: Twist the socks into shoe sole thread according to Mr. Zi Fang's method and use it to sew the soles of cloth shoes, which is economical and durable.</p>
<p>(2) Making sleeves: Cut off the lower half of old socks (i.e., the sock bottom and the small sock part), sew binding on the cut end, and put it on the sleeves of children's clothes to prevent the sleeves from getting dirty.</p>
<p>(3) Making belts: Cut off the sock bottoms of women's long torn stockings, leaving only two sock parts, sew them together with a needle, and use them as belts, which are soft and comfortable.</p>
<p>In addition, old socks can also be used to wrap wounds, which is ventilated and comfortable and suitable for hygiene. All of these are economical ways to live in these extraordinary times.</p>

<h3>On Eliminating Labor Unrest</h3>
<p>— Xiao Kangshi</p>
<p>Wage increases are not enough to eliminate future labor unrest. Curbing speculation and hoarding is the fundamental solution.</p>
<p>Since the Incident, more than three years have passed. Prices have soared several times higher than before the war. Shanghai's goods rely on other places for supply, so the high prices are to be expected. However, the price of vegetables in remote small towns is almost the same as in Shanghai. Today, it is not just local areas that are suffering; everyone is struggling in difficult circumstances, hoping to see the light again. Therefore, for workers earning a living in Shanghai, how many can support their families with a salary of tens of dollars, whether their families live in Shanghai or in the countryside? The recent labor unrest has spread like rampant weeds. The cause is the oppression of high living costs.</p>
<p>Therefore, many people believe that reasonable wage increases are the only good way to eliminate today's labor unrest, because workers will have stable lives and will not have the motivation to strike. Although this is a valid point, it is a superficial solution that does not address the root cause. Looking at the successive strikes today, the unstable state of society is already apparent. However, general speculators, manipulators, and hoarders are not only unmoved by this situation but also take advantage of the opportunity to stir up trouble and intensify their actions. The recent soaring rice prices are affecting society, and the danger is a hundred or a thousand times greater than the strike wave.</p>
<p>Therefore, if the capital side reluctantly increases wages, it may eliminate today's labor unrest. However, if the speculators, manipulators, and hoarders continue to intensify their actions, living costs will inevitably rise even higher in the future. Then, in the near future, it will be difficult to avoid a second or third strike. Therefore, using wage increases to eliminate labor unrest is only a "superficial solution" and not a "fundamental solution." However, in these dangerous times, there is no other way but to increase wages.</p>
<p>Therefore, from today onwards, we should immediately seek a "fundamental solution to eliminate future labor unrest," such as curbing speculation and manipulation, severely investigating speculators and hoarders, and unblocking sources. We should use bold methods without suspicion. Those with a little conscience should also take the overall situation into consideration during these difficult times and not prioritize power and wealth over the country. They should stimulate their conscience and save the country and the people. Then, it will not be difficult to suppress prices. If prices are suppressed, the people's lives can be stabilized, and there will be no reason for labor unrest to brew. This is like a weak and sick body that should be well-maintained to replenish qi and blood so that any "wind evil cannot take advantage of the weakness to enter." I ask those in power and those who care about society, what do you think?</p>
<h3>Chestnuts</h3>
<p>— Mo Fei</p>
<p>I ran into a fruit shop, and a thick cloud of smoke filled the air. I faintly heard the sound of cracking and bursting, and at the same time, a strange fragrance mixed with the smell of pine resin drilled into my nostrils.</p>
<p>"Chestnuts are on the market!" The red characters on the white paper were very eye-catching!</p>
<p>Chestnuts are my favorite. My feet stopped involuntarily.</p>
<p>The bag was the same size as last year, but the price had doubled—two cents per bag.</p>
<p>I took the chestnuts home in my sleeve. The children came to greet me. The older one tugged at my sleeve and immediately discovered them. "What is it? Oh, chestnuts!"</p>
<p>"Chestnuts! Chestnuts!" The younger children also shouted.</p>
<p>I had to take them out. I poured them all out and asked the oldest to count them. There were eleven in total. Two cents, eleven chestnuts!</p>
<p>We divided them equally among three people: three chestnuts per person, with two remaining. I gave them to my wife to try as well.</p>
<p>But these three chestnuts were too meager in the children's eyes. They felt a little unsatisfied, so my wife divided her two chestnuts among them and coaxed them, "Be good, don't quarrel. Dad will buy more next time, buy three bags." Then, she said as if to herself, "Eleven chestnuts for two cents, it's really too expensive. Living is really difficult with Liangxiang chestnuts!"</p>
<p>The conclusion was almost a sigh! In fact, my wife knows the difficulty of life better than I do. "Living is really difficult with Liangxiang chestnuts!" Now we can sing this for those of us who rely on a small salary to live!</p>
<p>"I won't buy them next time! I've tasted them, that's enough." I said to my wife.</p>
<h3>Small Speculators, It's Time to Wake Up</h3>
<p>— Jun Cai</p>
<p>I have been in the gold speculation market for quite some time, so I know the inside story. Here is a summary:</p>
<p>I work as a small clerk in a silver company that provides trading services for customers in Shanghai. Every morning before nine o'clock, the company is full of customers (small speculators). These people are all ordinary people (mostly unemployed businessmen). Although there are one or two people from special classes (referring to the wealthy), they seem to be addicted. They arrive on time every morning, rain or shine. If they are absent for a day, at least several phone calls will be made to inquire about the market. As a result, these small speculators are very unfortunate. Not only do they waste valuable time every day, but they also lose money on transportation and meals, and they are constantly worried. At the end of the month, they still lose their capital.</p>
<p>At the end of the month, the company summarizes the accounts. The total profit of the customers is about five thousand, while the total loss is over forty or fifty thousand. On average, more than nine out of ten customers lose money. Even if they are lucky enough to make a profit, the amount is very small. The silver companies, money shops, and firms that provide customer services benefit the most.</p>
<p>Small speculators' golden dreams, it's time to wake up!</p>
<p>The Hawthorne Case</p>
<h3>The Homecoming of the Dance Queen</h3>
<p>— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter Eight: Two People Caught</p>
<p>I patiently remained silent throughout the car ride. When the car drove to the entrance of the apartment on Avenue Edward VII, I was secretly pleased, thinking that he couldn't remain a silent statue once he got to the apartment. Because the words "still far" that he said really made me feel confused.</p>
<p>Shi Gui greeted us with a happy face and led us inside. Auntie Su had already set the table and brought the food. Hawthorne put down his hat and immediately sat down at the table, pouring another bucket of cold water on me. "Bao Lang, eat quickly, we'll talk later."</p>
<p>Hawthorne usually does not follow Confucius's motto of "don't talk while eating." This was another clear way of not letting me speak while eating. What did this mean? Was he really extremely hungry, unable to do two things at once, and busy eating? No, because after picking up his chopsticks, he only ate a shallow bowl of rice, which was only a quarter of his usual amount. He put down his chopsticks and sat down on the sofa that he usually sits on. I wasn't very hungry, and influenced by him, my appetite was greatly reduced as well. When Auntie Su came in to clear the table, she also had a surprised look on her face, but seeing the cold look on Hawthorne's face, she didn't dare to say much. After a while, we both lit cigarettes. My suppressed questions finally couldn't be held back any longer.</p>
<p>"Hawthorne, what exactly is going on? From my point of view, this case is progressing very smoothly. Why do you still look so troubled?"</p>
<p>Hawthorne exhaled a puff of smoke, looked at the floor, and replied, "I couldn't stand his cold laugh."</p>
<p>I quickly said, "His cold laugh? Are you talking about Zhao Boxiong?"</p>
<p>Hawthorne nodded, not answering.</p>
<p>I continued, "Strange, his laugh made you so upset. Are you arguing with him? Don't you always say that detectives should maintain their rationality and not be dominated by feelings? Now you're acting like this because of his cold laugh, isn't that ridiculous?" (122)</p>
<h3>Fundraising for the Young Women's Christian Association</h3>
<p>— Nan Ping</p>
<p>After reading the article "A Letter to Female Students Soliciting Donations for the Construction of the Young Women's Christian Association," I was very moved. Although I am a male student, based on the help the Young Women's Christian Association has given me in the past, I would like to also "tell" the male students from the perspective of a male student:</p>
<p>Since Shanghai became an "isolated island," the direct impact on the students has been twofold: First, the school buildings are small, the equipment is simple, the classrooms are dimly lit, and there is a lack of student dormitories and rest rooms. Second, there is no proper extracurricular entertainment. In the past three years, the Young Women's Christian Association has done its best to allow young male and female students to pour in. Every space in their already crowded association has been freed up for students to study, rest, play ball, and exercise, regardless of gender. Therefore, I say that the Young Women's Christian Association provides services to male students equal to those provided to female students.</p>
<p>Now, the Young Women's Christian Association is facing its most difficult time. The work has expanded extensively, but the association's facilities are insufficient. During this time of housing panic, the landlord will not even allow them to stay in this "insufficient space" any longer; not only are they openly building houses on the beautiful lawn in front, but the old building hidden in the back can only be occupied until August of next year. Are we willing to let such an organization with a long history and contribution to society disappear? No, absolutely not! Then we can only stand on the same front as the Young Women's Christian Association and do our part to help promote the building donation of the Young Women's Christian Association.</p>
<p>I hope that male students will seize this good opportunity to serve society and contribute generously. Everyone should do their part. In the future, when the student hall of the Young Women's Christian Association is built, we can also take a deep breath and say, "I have a part in this."</p>
