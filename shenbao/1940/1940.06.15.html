<h3>糧食靑黃不接時之處理</h3>
<p>輓近米價。又現昂漲之勢，粳米居奇尤甚，暗盤竟至六十餘元；洋米雖時有到貨，亦售五十五六元。麵粉在本街售十三元八角，而客銷已售十六元有奇。民食主此，實已復入艱危之域。或以此爲應有之現象，蓋已屆靑黃不接時期；原上海米市季節性之趨勢，本以六七兩月逐漸上升，至十月而漸低降；而况今年情形，初小可與往年並論。考歷年米價，雖在此季節及時而漲，然粉價正因麥秋畢登，遂得調劑於無形，今則新麥雖有收穫，而粉廠不能得新麥；有之。爲數亦有限，誠以「統制」壟斷，採辦則困難重重，運輸則極無把握。機製麵粉業昨日又向工部局作呼籲，企圖增加本街所銷粉價，自有得而藉口者在焉。夫粉麥旣不以出新而减輕，其事實上之嚴重，遂失其往年調劑民食之用；此所影響米市者。不僅上海米價節節上升而已。即如寗紹一帶米價，傳說有高至百餘元，則以寗紹本爲戶稠糧貧之鄕，向恃江海以資接濟；今則杭海（海寗）之江渡中斷，滬甬之海運多阻，加以蕭山淪陷，日軍雲集，就地徵糧，又足以奪民之食；糧價上漲，亦固其宜。本爲杭嘉淪陷區之米價則高至六十餘元。最近浦東沿浦一帶米店，竟主被迫而出於無形停業；緣浦東各米行，自各虞購來國米，通過浦江，須以每石三十七元之代價，强制購買半數，充作軍米；米商因此虧累甚鉅；力所不勝，呼籲無門，故雖照常開門，而已無米應市。此外，如蘇錫常原是產米之區，今被限定價格，大舉採辦米石，每動辦一次，數萬石不等，其搜刮期間，且不許他人分購，於是產地亦不得不食貴米。不惟價貴，抑且源竭；於是各地食米，皆惟洋米是賴。以目前情况而論，滬上洋米。固無虞中輟、然米商因緣時會，奇貨自居。再加以投機奸宄。搖惑人心，輒謂天時久旱，行將影響未來米糧之收成云云，於以造就操縱之機會焉。而不知時令方始入霉。昨已時雨霏霏，綽爲霉令景象，出霉就在七月十五日；有此一月功夫，雨量之爲多爲少，尙在未定之天、，則近頃之晴嘆，未足遽視爲有妨挿秧，更何必便虞歉收？祝滬上存米頗豐，而米價不絕上漲，此其爲人爲的操縱居奇，不可掩飾也。</p>
<p>本報對於本市民食，數年來夙以爲務於農商民食兼顧之原則下，以求適當之處理；庶幾以經常之相利，形成永久之相濟，若顧此失彼，則一時之利縱溥，顧不可以持久也。至於目前民食之處理限於環境，當然無法實現理想之調節；自惟有捨本逐末。先謀市塲之安定；市塲安定，縱不能完全使物價安定，而至小限度，可以防杜因人爲操縱而起之不安定，此其一。糧食管制，在目前之租界情况下，有所難能，然亦不容因難能而放任，遂將民食問題置諸腦後；理應就其可能之職責權力範圍內，爲大衆所受之民食艱難設想，分別設法相當之解決，此其二。商人將本以求利者也，有利則趨，無利則却步；以言牟利居奇，罔顧民生，事實上比比皆然，初不惟米商爲不可宥也。况夫商司販運。價高可徠遠貨，不予販運者以利益，行將裹足不前，反足爲民食之憂。是以對於商人應享之利益，務予顧全，然必須制止其過分之掠奪，以維民生，此其三。因之今日所可爲民食計者，仍在於本報夙昔所主張，即集中買賣，公開評價取銷名存實亡之限價，澈底辦理糧食之登記而已。而尤在實事求是，不可徒託言，終成具文。限度之內，許以自由營運，其有弁髦禁例，私自居奇者，應從嚴處分，不稍寬假。務使市塲以外無行市，行市之中求整一。買賣一以實銷爲主，現款爲憑。若不能無期貨交易，亦以洋行實際之定貨爲限。近來米市塲上習聞之所謂「浮囤心思貨」與夫「皮球交易」，皆足爲米市祟，務在嚴格取締之列。質言之，使市面歸於正常，不爲投機操縱所左右。然此尙爲平準糧價之初步辦法，　足與語根本之圖。蓋言民食行故，第一須當局打定主意，抱定決心，此之謂政策。第二須制定切實方案，組織健全權構，此之謂技術。第三須託付於忠實而幹練之人才，蓋有治法無治人，正以見徒法不能以自行。三者粗備，然後可言進一步之辦法。</p>

<p>「當此危急存亡之秋、余有一事願首先普吿世人者、即吾國軍隊之英勇、吾國士兵與其長官之壯烈是也、余曾親見自前錢歸來之戰士、且行且戰、時受飛機之困擾、因之已五日未能合目、敵人自以爲可使此輩之神經遭受打擊、殊不知彼等對於戰爭之最後結果、依然抱有確定之信心、其對於國家之前途、更無絲毫之疑念、月初吾軍在鄧扣克一役之英勇戰蹟、已爲舉世所稱道矣、但近日自海岸至亞爾哥納區一綫之戰事、其壯烈情形更有過之無不及、可見法蘭西魂絕未被人征服、吾國民族決不在外力侵凌之下屈服、千百年來吾人所生息之領土上、巳不知將侵略者擊退或征服若干次、抑吾國過去對於世界人類貢獻甚大、是以此際人人應知其所負於法國者良多、更應知償還債務之日業已屆臨、法國陸軍茲已爲全世界各民洽國陸軍之前驅者、法國陸軍刻正犧牲自己、目前吾人即使戰敗、亦足使全世界各國之共同敵人遭受重大打擊、例如敵方坦克車被擊毀者不知凡幾、飛機被擊落者又不知凡幾、其兵員摜失慘重、其汽油池尤多中彈起火、凡此種種、自足以影響德國民族之精神狀態、然則時至此際、受創之法國實有權向其他各民治國有所請求、余深信凡其有正義感者、決無一人能加以拒絕、但贊成爲一事行動又爲一事、偉大的美國民族素來重視理想、此乃吾人所深知者、時局如此、吾美國友大對於聲明反對國社主義的德國一事、豈尙欲多事猶豫耶、余日昨已向羅斯福總統詢及此點、茲願再向之提出二次呼籲、亦即最後的呼籲、過去余每次請求羅斯福總統在美國法律許可範圍之內加緊援助吾人時、總統無不慷慨爲之、同時美國人民亦輒能加以贊可、高誼雲情、實深感激、但此際問題已不復若是簡單、蓋以今日巳爲法國之存亡問題、現行戰事旣日見困苦、今後荀非共同　利之希望日見濃厚、直無意義之可曾、例如英國空軍質地優良、固已獲有事實證明、但吾人苟欲擊碎籠軍歐洲之惡勢力、實有待於大西洋彼岸之軍用飛機源源接濟也、總之、各民治國陣綫雖已遭受挫折、但仍保有無窮之力量、因此吾人希望各民治國利用全部力量、從事搏門之時期日見迫近、吾人心中所由充滿希望者、其故在此、吾人所由決定法國必須保有自由的政府、因此必須放棄巴黎者、其故亦在於此、良以希特勒之用心、乃欲消滅吾人之合法政府、俾向全世界揚言、法國巳不復存在、並從而組織傀儡政府、一如其在他國境內所爲、吾人爲防止此種奸計起見、實有退出巴黎之必要也、按諸史乘、吾國民族每當遭受實大折處之日、從未爲敗戰主義者之言論所動、此即吾國民族之偉大處、今後不論發生何種事變、法國民族決定含辛茄苦堅持到底、質言之、吾人決不有負法國光榮之歷史、吾人決當親愛如手足、而以全力爲受創之祖國奮鬥以達復興之目的」云、（十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>兩事偶然巧合</h3>
<p>華盛頓　今日白宮宜稱、羅斯福總統最近在查洛資維爾之演說、一般人皆認爲係對於法總理萊諾籲請美國援助之答覆、其實法總理之電文、至羅斯福返自查洛資維雨後始行呈遞、故其演辭之適與法總理針對、不過爲巧合而已、按羅總統六月十日在佛吉尼亞州大學發表演說、謂美國尤以物質資源援助抵抗武力者（十三日路透電）</p>
<h3>新舊制度鬥爭</h3>
<p>瑞典京城「阿夫頓報」載稱、羅斯福總統對於義大利已有劇烈之反動、目前已不再爲美國中立之問題、吾人現時目擊當、爲世界新舊兩種制度之爭鬥、羅總統所發言論之幕後、有美國物質資源之實際價値在焉、况羅總統已認識美國或在最近之將來　甚　　追放棄其非交戰國之地位、法國之嚴重敗挫或英國之被攻擊、皆將決定美國之出而干預也、（十四日路透電）</p>
<h3>派兵難成事實</h3>
<p>華盛頓　聞萊諾之呼籲電、將於今晚到達、其內容諒係希望軍事上之援助、但羅總統宣稱、「美巳盡其可盡之力」、此間觀察家均信、就萊諾來電之語氣而論、若美國不急派大隊戰機赴援、則法國恐將屈服在即、官方意見以爲協約國若不解體、則法英本土縱被征服、「不投降」一政策亦將使東半球全部成爲戰塲、但羅斯福總統將派遺遠征軍一節、似無成爲事實之跡象、因彼屢次宣稱、政府不欲派軍至歐也（十四日國際社電）</p>
<h3>法國北部居民　撤退情形　避難猶如潮湧　沿途秩序井然</h3>
<p>倫敦　路透社隨法境英空軍特派員、詳述巴黎及法國北部其他地方居民大規模撤退之情形云、渠在人海之中駛行五十餘哩、目擊避難人民猶如潮湧、此輩難民之忍耐精神均可欽佩、渠親見一處汽油站前有多人列隊等候購油、無一爭先恐後者、汽油雖將就罄、但每人皆分得少許、各損毀之車輛、亦有人爲之修理、各旅店俱懸「客滿」之牌、後至者祇得望望然引去、無有口出不遜强欲佔得一席之地者、各飯館及商店之情形亦然、後至不能果腹或購得貨物、亦皆無口出怨言者、各難民兩目雖皆露困倦、但鮮有淚痕、坐於請籠雜物中間之見童時露其笑靨、一若表示　於此長途跋涉、並不感痛苦者、老年人均因困倦而入睡、滿佈皺紋及果決之面容、似在睡夢中仍具有决心、難民所駕駛之車輛、多隨帶兩物、一爲革聲、以備無處容身時權充臥具、二爲自行車、俾汽車損壞或馬匹過勞頓時、暫以之代步、（十四日路透電）</p>
<h3>英倫開始　疏散兒童</h3>

<h3>美駐英大使　與英外相晤談　南軍需援助事</h3>
<p>倫敦　美駐英大使甘納第昨日與英外相哈里法克斯會談衆信雙方係討論美國進一步援助協約國事、一般相信德軍佔領巴黎僅爲時閒問題、法國地位因之處於危險狀况、英國請求美國予以軍事原料、藉以遏阻德國之威脅則更形迫切、衆信倘美國能儘速將軍需品輸往協約國、協約國不僅能阻止德軍前進幷能擊退德軍（十四日合衆社電）</p>
<h3>日與泰國　友好條約　與英泰不侵犯約　謂性質截然不同</h3>
<p>東京　關於盤谷傳來泰國（即暹邏）巳與英法締結互不侵犯條約之官方消息、英籍某訪員頃問日外務省發言人、日本是否反對英國與泰國互不侵犯、發言人答曰吾、日本與泰國之友好條約、與英法對泰國之互不侵犯條約及其談判、均無關係、日泰條約與芙法對泰國之互不侵犯條約截然不同、蓋日泰條約志在維持並增進兩國業巳存在之和平友好關銀、而互不侵犯條約如一九二六年蘇聯所始創、乃因一方恐對方侵略而締結云、（十四日路透電）</p>

<p>安加拉　衆信土耳其之地位、因義大利參戰造成之局勢、不久將予以闡明、大約土總理賽丹今日將發正式文吿、昨日當局全日考慮土耳其若取任何步驟所含之一切糾紛、內閣曾集議兩次、人民黨似將繼續舉行全體會議、英法大使昨復與土當局接談、而駐此之義德外交家亦甚活動、同時在最近命令下應入伍之後備兵、其中農民現正紛紛離其田園而加入軍隊、馬匹車輛在必要處均經微發、此種活動並非表示土耳其將立即宣戰、不過爲土政府對本國防務與義務非常重視之一種徵象耳、（十四日路透電）</p>
<p>安加拉　據此間所接消息、德土兩國昨日所訂立之貿易協定、已經交換批准文件、按該項協定、規定每年雙方交換貨物之價値達二一·〇〇〇·〇〇〇</p>
<p>柏林　關於西班牙宣佈爲非交戰國、以及土耳其決定採取中立政策、柏林方面極表歡迎、對於西班牙之自中立改爲非交戰國、德國認爲係表示德義西之團結、而土耳其繼續中立、以及德土商務條約之締結、此間政界人士認爲係土國眞正遵從凱末爾遺策之表示云、（十八日海通社電）</p>
<p>土京·據「坦報」載稱、英法土三國互助公約規定於義國襲擊地中海東部時、以軍事援助給與土耳其、但義國並無將戰事擴大至地中海東部之意向、未來之發展雖不可知、然預料義國必儘量限制其軍事行動云、（十四日海通社電）</p>
<h3>埃不設防城市　倘遭轟炸　當立即對義宣戰</h3>
<p>開羅　埃及現行對義政策、純屬防禦性質、惟據此間人士聲稱、埃及旣完全尊羅英埃條約、則本身自當受英國支配、至在保障安全方面對英合作、而以供給海陸空軍根據地爲限、此等根據地當然須以軍事目的物視之、而將遭義方龔擊、然義國苟攻擊埃及他處領土、或向純屬埃方之飛機塲口岸城鎭或軍民投彈、則埃及將被迫宣戰云、（十四日路透社電）</p>

<h3>歐戰初起時的　一片「中立」聲（六）</h3>
<p>— 叔棣</p>
<p>預言自然是非常危險的事；不過，照目前一般有眼光的觀察家們的多數意見，縱那樣，也還是不可能的。最簡單的了解方法，是最好一瞥當前的歐洲地圖。波蘭的消滅，恐怕是一個時間的問題而已。到那時，地理形勢是：意大利和穗國同盟，她還可以和蘇，德共同伸展勢力於巴爾幹半島；反過來，她如果和德國脫離，而加入英，法方面時，立刻，她就會被遂出於巴爾幹，而受到了德，蘇約夾持。現在，在英，法當政者們的腦子裏，時時地，在出現着上次歡戰意大利倒戈的例子，希望牠可以重演。不過，我們必須知道一點，上次歐戰時，俄國是站在協約國方面的。戰爭未爆發前，英，法拆散德，意軸心的最好方法，是與蘇聯同盟。現在呢，這當然已成了過去。像目前蘇聯這種對德的善意中立情形下，拆出意大利是不可能的。而實際呢，這時候談什麼拆散德，意集團，實在是一個除了宣傳而外毫無內容的話。我們都知道，自從去年慕尼黑會議以來，德，意兩國作戰的準備，早就放在一個同　的基礎上，在實際組織着，分配着了。以高度工業化高度集中化的兩個獨裁者的關家，事實上，早就成了一個作戰的單位，絕對難以輕易拆散！要是詳細述起來，在這裏，恐怕太佔篇幅；這裏，祗能舉出兩個最明顯的例子，以見一斑。第一，我們知道，德國自一九三八年九月起，就經常不斷地有一百萬人以上動了員，又加上政治上的濫捕和種族上的排猶，種種湊起來，就生出了一個附帶的嚴重結果：人工缺乏。對於一個在積極備戰的國家，這是很嚴重的恐慌。那末，怎樣補救呢？一個空前的事出現了；由意大利大枇供給了人工，—包括工人和農夫—成車成車地運往德國。這不是單純的工人和農人們個人行動，這是德。意兩國國策的一部份。再有一件同樣在別的狀况下，國與國間，也是絕對不可能的事；那是德國大規模地供給意大利以下級陸軍軍官，改組意大利的陸軍。因此，並且曾引起意大利陸軍方面對墨索里尼的反感和抗議，那嚴重性，是可以想像了</p>
<p>把彼此的資源放在一處，而從事在同一基礎上作戰的組織和準備，以這一點而論，德。意一集團還早於英·法一集團的。</p>
<p>那末，最後的問題是：意大利爲什不參加德國對英·法的戰鬥呢？答案還是如同前面我所說過的：她實際已經參加了，不過方式是「不參加」而已。換句話說，這不過是德·意集團的整個策略的一部。前面我叙述德國整個策略時，已經約略提到過，這裏不贅了。（五）西班牙的反對「擴大戰爭」（九月十九）</p>
<p>在戰爭未爆發前的那些天，西班牙的態度，是人家注目的，一個有意味的問題。牠的性質，是相當的微妙；不加入慶？一切的國際條件，與西班牙國內的條件，都在否定着這一點。加入德意方面麽？如果是這樣，那末，這幾個月來佛朗哥積極進行着的復員工作，又成了泡影，他得趕緊再動員；可是，在百孔千瘡的西班牙，他到那裏去籌這筆款呢？那末，趁機倒戈加入英法方面麽？這更是不可能的。祇舉兩件事說，在西班牙西北部和南部的海岸上，所有的德意兩國所建的砲壘和潛水艇的根據地，就是西班牙萬難脫離德意兩國的枷鎖；再有，像那逗留在西班牙與法國交界處庇里牛斯山南麓的大批德意軍事人員和技術家，也是西班牙倒戈的一個大大的障碍。</p>
<p>到現在，事實終於替我們解答了一切的疑問。她步了意大利的後塵，以「不參戰」的方式，而參加了對英法的戰鬥。</p>
<p>這裏，因而我們得到了一個大致正確的啟示：西班牙的態度，多多少少，是以意大利態度爲轉移的。</p>
<p>外交方面，這些時來，她和英法之間，早已入了一個停止的狀態。最活躍的時期，是政府軍敗績的前夜，到今年八月初旬的這一段時期。可是，自從法外長龐萊指揮下的拉携工作失敗，法國駐西大使，和佛朗哥個人有着師生淵源的畢當上將親善工作再度失敗後，跟着作第三次試騐的，就祇有英國的工業代表團了。一直到大戰爆發的前夜，這一批代表團還在訪問西班牙的過程中，並沒有收到一點效果。所以，在大戰爆發前，英法決定對德宜戰時，她們對於西班牙也就和對意大利一樣，並沒有存了什麽幻想。</p>
<p>軍事方面呢，英法最擔心的，就是西班牙海岸對直布羅陀的威脅，所以，比起任何其他據措都要早，英國海軍動員後的第一件事，就是宜佈封鎖直布羅陀海峽。至於西班牙西北海岸的德意潛艇根據地，因爲西班牙在法雜上還是「中立」的地位，英法是無可如何的。近來德國潛艇在大西洋的活躍，最大原因，就是因爲在這一帶，牠有着良好根據地的緣故</p>
<p>最重要的，當然是經濟方面。自從英海軍官是佈封鎖德國進口貨之後，德國與南美各國貿易，已經完全截斷了。現在德國的補救方法，就是利用西班牙的海岸，作爲對南美各國貿易的轉口。由此運往意大利，或巴爾幹各國。因爲西班牙和南美各國，大多是同一種族的緣故，所以在這一點上，德國可以逃過美國宜傳影響下甫美各國的所謂「道德制裁」，而佔了很大的便利。</p>
<p>把西班牙的態度和地位，去和意大利一比，我們立刻就可以發現，她的態度，實際上，就是意大利態度的縮影。不過在形式上，却也有着常常爲大家所忽略了的一個小小不同：意大利所宣佈的，僅僅是暫時不加入戰鬥；西班牙呢，却是明白地宜佈了「中立。因爲意大利和德國的同盟，是正式宜佈了的，因之，在條約上的地位，意大利如果宜佈「中立」的話，那就等於退盟，西班牙呢，雖然實際上，和德意有着軍事同盟關係，然而却沒有公佈出來，所以在條約上的地位，她可以於德國對外作戰時，宜佈當然的「中立」。當然，這些形式上的不同，並不影響事件的根本。西班牙的宜佈「中立」，也就和意大利的宜佈「不參戰」一樣，都祇能作爲德意整個戰略的一部而求得對牠的了解。</p>

<h3>防務加强治安無慮　租界地位愈鞏固　偽方宣傳攻擊不起作用　商團補充缺額實力充足</h3>
<p>自義大利實行參戰後、本埠因恐由於英法義駐軍之對立、引起糾紛、一時形勢、頗呈緊張、但由於各國駐軍維持租界現狀、態度與行動之堅決、已成爲上海最有力之安定因素、萬國商團、近復補充團員、增加實力、故此後治安、無虞憂慮、因此人心寗定、秩序安謐、一切均已恢復常態、惟僞方竟提出撤軍要求、鼓吹「收回」租界、但駐滬各國外交當局、旣不加重視、抑且視若無覩、其不足爲破壞租界秩序之患、亦彰彰明甚矣、茲彙誌各情如次、</p>
<p>無聊攻擊　不必重視</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、自義大利參戰後、在滬刋行之某方報紙、又如去年九月三日歐洲戰事爆發之初，舊疾復作、開始向在華各外國租界作劇烈之宣傳攻擊、其論調謂欲保證租界之法律與秩序、列强應將租界交還所謂「南京組織」云云、此間對於此種言論、絕無官方之評論、因與中國有關之列强、均未加以承認也、至一般方面之意見、則認爲租界之地位、某方全無干係、某某方面指稱、我等不能屈尊降貴、加以評論、而汚口舌、據信某方報紙之嘵嘵在言、未必獲得後援、因日本巳決定不介入歐洲現局、而干擾在華之外國租界也、</p>
<p>萬國商團　實力加强</p>
<p>工部局萬國商團、對於公共租界防務上之助力、厥功甚偉、惟自歐戰發生後、本埠大部外僑、爲保衛祖國起見、專返前綫從戎、效力沙塲、以致志願團員頓形减少、其中以英國隊伍爲尤甚、商團總司令亨培、曾迭向各方籲請、補充缺額人員、更有望於雇主方面、對於雇員之參加志願團員者、予以便利、而英總領事署亦曾通令英僑踴躍參加、工部局總董凱自威、對於充實萬國商團、竭力倡導、以身作則、由其主持之怡和洋行所有英籍職員、予以種種便利、使之得以加入、最近該洋行職員中、已有二十餘人正式加入爲該團英格蘭騎兵隊中服務、此外挪瑞僑民、與猶太難民、之參加者亦甚踴躍、</p>
<p>空軍人員　返英服役</p>
<p>本埠英國皇家空軍協會會員杜克洛斯少校、不久將離滬遄返加拿大、爲英軍服務、該會特於昨日午時、在外灘匯豐銀行房子設宴爲杜氏餞行、當時室中所懸萬國旗、其中義大利國旗、已預先除去、而奧國之舊國旗、則仍在其內、席間杜氏發表演說、稱彼爲後備軍人之一、此次赴加拿大、當能爲英國空軍服務、殆無疑義、彼在此間會接得不少英僑願意入伍之申請書、彼將來抵達加拿大之後、當將此事呈報當局、並設法使此等有志爲國効勞之人民、達到其目的、</p>
<p>法使餞別入伍軍人</p>
<p>本埠法僑退伍軍人協會、昨晚（十四日）下午六時半、假法巡捕房總會、舉行餞別被召入伍法僑靑年茶會、駐華法大使戈思默及總領事奧仁、均被邀參加、</p>
<p>義大使館　遷移完竣</p>
<p>自義大利宣佈參戰後界金神父路一一八號義大使館及大使官邸、爲避免意外、除將義國國旗自動停懸外、並將所有文件檔案、連日搬運至成都路義領署、所有人員、亦均自動遷離、搬運工作、已於昨日竣事、記者昨赴該處視察、見大使館鐵門虛掩、門口有法捕華捕二名駐守、使館內部空庭寂寞、甚少人跡、僅五六法華警捕、往來蹀躞、嚴密保衛、景象殊爲冷落、至成都路義領署則照常工作、且因使館人員遷入、出入者增多、較前更見繁忙矣、</p>
<p>愛麥虞限　路牌失蹤</p>
<p>英文大美晚　報云法租界愛麥虞限路、係根據義國國王愛麥處限三世而命名者、該路與金神父路轉角相近一端之路牌、今（十四日）晨忽告失踪、據目擊者吿法租界警員稱、彼等於昨（十三日）夜九至十時間、曾見外人及華人各一、將該處路牌拆去、法方官員則表示愛麥處限路路名不致改變、</p>
<p>電車公司　義人辭職</p>
<p>據外人方面消息、本埠法商雷車公司義籍職員二名、已自動辭職、彼等之辭職書中稱、彼等對公司過去一切、均極滿意、惟因公司內大部爲法籍職員、故願自動引退、以免日後發生磨擦、又據探悉、另有在該公司服務多年之義籍職員二人、亦將採取同樣態度、向該公司自動提出辭職、</p>
<h3>紐約設中央委員會　籌募華災賑款</h3>
<p>大陸報云、本市美國顧問委員會、代表美國敎會振華委員會、乃分配美國救濟金之中心團體、巳往一年來、平均每月撥款十萬元、在中國各地從事振濟、頃據該會某委員吿記者稱、目下美國雖甚關切於歐戰難民之亟切需要、然料美國指交在華應用之救濟金、不致减少、本市已接消息、美國發起敎會委員會之各</p>
<p>教會團體</p>
<p>新近在紐約成立中央委員會、籌募在華及在歐洲各國從事救濟之款項、委員皆係特別熟悉世界各地情况之人士、接獲各地呼籲後、負責分配救濟款項、預料中央委員會即將撥相當數額之救濟金來華、因中國遭受天災兵燹、各地情况、較諸歐洲尤爲惡劣也、本市救濟工作人員、及美國顧問委員會、皆信該中央委員會行將劃交中國之救濟金、必較敎會委員會撥來者爲多、則進行賑濟工作、可較前</p>
<p>更易見效</p>
<p>矣、同時、上海美國顧問委員會賡續撥未交各救濟區、該會星期二日舉行會議、核准撥交北平及由東等區之巨額救濟金數注、據該會所接報吿、華北冀魯兩省亢早、又有飢饉之虞、如濟南發來報吿、有小麥毫無收穫、農民已不能再事耕耘、故秋收無望等語、該會星期二日會議時、核准其他救濟金、包括杭州二萬二千尤、華北孩童福利計劃逃行經費二萬五千元、及湖州五千元、</p>
<h3>法幣與美金　並稱堅强　已爲唯一自由通貨</h3>
<p>本星期四出版之英文金融商業報云、現今全世界各國通貨、莫不遭受人爲之控制、僅美金及法幣尙爲自由之貨幣、未受統制、自義大利宜佈參戰後、投機大見减少、握有外匯頭寸者、莫不爭先出籠、其趨向多頭者、可謂完全絕跡、近因世界局勢關係、匯市動盪不定、投機之危險甚大、上星期中投機份子賣出英匯進美匯者、莫不蝕本、</p>
<h3>英義德在滬僑商　互禁通商往來　英商會列舉德商號名稱　義商已着手商務上結束</h3>
<p>自義大利參戰後、本埠英大使館曾發表文吿、警吿僑商勿與敵人通商、並列舉本埠義國商業機關九家、促僑商特別加以注意、茲據探悉、英國對德、早巳採取此項措置、其列入特別注意之德國商業機關、不下二百餘家其機關設於上海者、亦</p>
<p>有八十家之多、茲根據英國商會於六月八日發表者、摘舉如後、江西路二六七號中國電器股份有限公司·四川路二六一號矮克發洋行。江西路一三八號拜耳藥品無限公司·北京路三五六號天祥洋行·四川路三四六號拜道爾夫製藥公司。北京路二號百祿洋行·四川路六七〇號禮和洋行·江西路一三八號謙信機器有限公司。江西路二三六至一三八號謙信洋行·北京路二號克丁荷五金公司·四川路二六一號德孚洋行·江西路四五一號台麥克廠·九江路八五號德華銀行·圓明園路一三三號德國金銀化學出品社·四川路二六一號愛禮司洋行·廣東路七五號德國新聞社、廣東路二十號義泰公司·福州路三十號福羅洋行·仁記路九七號德國鐵路旅行社·四川路四一〇號雅利洋行。四川路一一〇號喜望公司圓明園路一三三號義信洋行·廣東路二十號亨寶輪船公司·圓明園路一三三號加林保五金機器廠·圓明園路一三三號高樂洋行·漢密而登大厦二二七號克勞西機器聯合公司·四川路一一〇號孔士洋行·等等、</p>
<p>義商結束</p>
<p>本埠各義商洋行自接奉義總領對英法各外商停止營　之文吿後、即開始對外商業務上之結束、因本埠義商爲數不多、而營業範圍亦不若其他如外商之廣泛、如開利洋行等、在平素營業範圍、除各種物品供給駐滬軍部外、對外貿易、本極微細、今則專爲承辦軍部貨品、故自奉令後於兩日內即大部宣吿淸楚矣</p>
<h3>日機襲渝　濫炸平民</h3>
<p>昨日出版之寗勒氏評備報、刋有重慶來函稱、日機五月廿八日襲重慶時、會作最慘酷之屠殺、當時有平民無數、麕集南區某防空洞口、未及避入洞內、日機見之、竟向之連續擲彈、炸死平民約百人、該函中指稱、「余信上海日軍發言人對此、又將稱之爲軍事目標也」、日機該次襲渝、又特別注重工廠區、城郊某工廠曾被投彈六十枚之多、但日人竟宜稱日機已炸毀中國新興之工業及中國飛機塲矣、</p>
<h3>滬美國商會主張　擴充航運　將有新輪駛遠東　與滬市繁榮攸關</h3>
<p>本埠美國商會、以遠東船隻隻、並增多遠東航運、聞不久之將來、美國當有新船加人遠東航運、現在中國海日輪、僅及八一三前之半英輪自歐戰後、遠東航務、更趨衰退、故美輪增加、與市面有重大關係、各方正注視中、</p>
<h3>煤氣明日加價　附加費增至百分之一五八　經工部局公用委員會核准</h3>
<p>上海自來火公司、近以各項物價飛漲、公司營業費用激增、尤以燃料爲最、爰經檢附本年預算書呈請工部局准將煤氣附加費白分之八十提高至百分之一五八、籍資挹注、據該公司陳稱、上年燃料一項所費、僅二·三五六·三八八、而本年估計、約需六·六一七·〇〇〇元、此外如職工薪給·津貼以及各項物力等等、莫不因物價高翔而遞增、至於煤氣銷售數額、雖比上年增加、但增出部份之成本、因煤斤關係、教爲重大、基上種種、自非請求加價、不足以資彌補、案　工部局公用事業委員會於本月七日曁十一日兩度開會、提出討論、並邀請公司代表列席解釋、以昭愼重、結果各委員僉以公司所陳各節、尙慶實情、應准照加、自煤氣用期在七月十六日或十六日以後終止之時起實行、惟局方得在三個月以內重行考量之、上項議案、業經該局董事會本月十二日例會通過矣、</p>
<h3>攻宜昌炸重慶　日軍師老無功　和平謠言業經華方否認　恐怖政策足使戰事延長</h3>
<p>據本埠美國「經濟評論」的翰愛立斯氏稱，近數週以來、本埠股票市塲中、不復盛傳中日和平之謠言、甚且有認爲日軍之猛攻宜昌、在炸重慶、足以促成中日和平談判者、但依渠之意見、日軍之猛攻宜昌、適足以證明中日戰事之無盡時、觀乎國民政府之堅決否認和平、及表示其繼續抗戰之決心、固在在皆有力之證據也、揚子江與上海間之貨運、由於宜昌發生戰事關係、將被截　、　後通過戰區、由上　運往西川各地之貨品、恐不能獲得暢銷　　以紡織品爲甚、惟反觀日本之　業、近亦未見有好轉之象、日本之最大鑛廠、會因銀行之拒絕貸款　宣吿停頓、日人在華之軍事行動，已使日本各業蒙受嚴重之損</p>
<h3>統一九次本息　四行付款</h3>
<p>民國二十五年統一公債甲乙丙丁戊五種債票第九次還本、以及到期息金、自關餘擔保各債財政部被迫停付本息後、持券人對於此次應付之本息頗爲關懷、新聲社記者昨向銀行界探得確訊、九次本息業經國債基金管委會商得中中交農四行同　、予以貼現付款、今中中交三行上海分行已奉總行命令、準七月三十一日起開始付款、凡持券人得塡具貼現付款申請書、經三行查騐無訛後、即付給「貼現憑證」、分六期付淸、　期一個月、至十二月底如數淸　、並以上海適用之滙劃付給之、今貼現憑證及申請書均已印竣、決準期付款、</p>

<p>招雇船員　國際勞工局中國分局探悉、德義各輪工作華工、全部總計二萬餘人、失業後已分別返國、英法商輸爲欲維持商運起見、業已施行聯運護航法、需用員工甚衆、已在港滬兩地、招雇失業船員二百餘人、分發英法輪服務、安全問題、均有相當保障、且薪金亦較優厚、</p>

<h3>去年法租界　公共衛生進步　各種設施力求整飭　猶太醫生數目增加</h3>
<p>據法公董局衛生處年報中謂、去年一年、衛生情形、大加整飭、前此則情形極爲混亂、去年死亡率之高、與一九三八年相等、尤可注意者、每死亡登記之百人、其中有七十二人爲兒童、</p>
<p>撲滅天花　收效甚速</p>
<p>該報告調查主要疾病種類、並指出在一九四〇年一月之第一週中、天花流行、有六十九起、後即减少、至五月已完全絕跡、外僑死亡之百分數爲三一·八一、而華人死亡數則爲三七·七二、一九三八年冬之天花流行、證明有設法防止之必要、種痘之人數、超過五四〇、〇九一人以上、新生嬰兒之種痘、亦嚴加施行、</p>
<p>防止傷寒　情形良好</p>
<p>至上海傷寒及副傷寒病症之防止、情形亦極爲良好、去年之傷寒、自前年開始、其兇猛來勢、日漸减退、八月後、比前年同月數目較低、患傷寒者只有一二一八起、死亡者五百零八人、此項傳染病起源、非由自來水而來、因法自來水公司所供給飲料、質地甚良、而若干井水、亦加管理、</p>
<p>霍亂患者　多未注射</p>
<p>霍亂之第一次發生爲去年六月、後有紀録可查者，共達七十七起、內有十三人死亡、由統計上證明、其中百分七七、九二染病者、皆未經注射、注射之効果、更可由各營中之士兵證明之、由於士兵之必需注射、無一發生斯項病症者、</p>
<p>消毒工作　亦甚積極</p>
<p>本年消毒服務改組、亦企改善衛生狀况、並希積極消毒服務、由敎育及與社會人士合作而實現、在其調查中、調查員會用法·英·俄·華四國文字發出公吿、華人亦漸明白病人須着消毒衣服之必要、</p>
<p>調騐牛乳　塡塞土井</p>
<p>在下年中、法租界可不致有瘋犬病發生、雖在本年中尙有中外人士二百二十八前往治瘋犬病、法租界牛乳消毒、開始於一九三九年不淸潔牛乳之調騐、仍繼續進行、有若干新井已淘成、深井已達五十五口、有若干華人之井、業已證明不潔、有南口室全塡塞、</p>
<p>工廠衛生　陸續改善</p>
<p>領有執照之工廠至去年底爲止、爲一千六百所、較小工廠、設　極差、其中大部分空氣流通及光綫、極需改善、防天花之種痘及防霍　傷寒之注射、對於此項工廠之工人、皆須遵行、</p>
<p>淸除垃圾　焚化屍體</p>
<p>法租界垃圾淸除、曾　生困難、但至年底、巳不成問題、慈善機關祖任掩埋工作、埋葬無人收殮之成人、達二三一五具、焚化之兒童屍體、達一三六七一具、因黃浦江上行動受限制、使當局不得不對於無人收殮之屍體、終年實行焚化工作、因此被焚化之屍體、共達一七六六九具、</p>
<p>中外醫生　二千餘人</p>
<p>外國醫生去年登記者、數目極高、其原因由於猶太難民來滬、華人醫生則略形减少、去年底、在法工部局登記之醫生、華人外人、共二二五六人、</p>
<p>學校衛生　極堪滿意</p>
<p>工部局學校衛生狀况、亦會加調查、各校共有中外學生九百人、調查結果、並無天花霍亂發生、工部局設立之俄人學校及幼稚院中、曾有少數白喉症發生　但即加注射、防止蔓延、</p>
<h3>陰丹士林布運內地　經越南被扣留　地方政府認有德貨嫌疑　廠商請法駐滬領館證明</h3>
<p>本埠自抗戰後、　後方各種物品之輸送、大部由越南轉口、經由滇越鐵路運往內地、因內地人民之需要、故貨運殊爲繁忙、而尤以布疋爲甚、蓋國內各淪陷區民衆、轉道徙入內地、致人口之激增數倍於往昔、衣着非消耗品、故更形暢銷也、最近因義大利實行參戰後、英法義三國各目通吿本國商行、對敵對國之一切貨品相互禁止交易、致本埠運往各內地之布疋經由越南轉口者、如有德國商標嫌疑、即被扣留、聞最近輸出之「陰丹士林」、在越南均被扣留、因「陰丹士林」係德國之註册商標也、查該布除商標係由德國註册外、其餘在布疋上染織紡之原料、均係國產、本埠各廠商聞悉之餘、羣相駭異、已函請市商會轉請法國駐滬領館、予以證明、以利商運、而維持中法兩國固有之敦睦邦交、</p>
<h3>加拿大商務代表　回國請示　義加外交關係　宜戰後即斷絕</h3>
<p>義國向　法宣戰後、加拿大即繼之對義宣戰、在滬之加拿大官吏、亦禁與義方往來、斷絕外交上關係、加拿大政府在滬商務代表賽克樂斯少校、爲有所請示起見、定於明日離滬返國、</p>
<h3>日承認華軍兩師　迫近杭垣　渡錢塘江署　將近十萬名</h3>

<h3>前晚海格路事件　雙方和平解決　因偽警乘車違章而起　華越捕被拘後卽釋放</h3>
<p>法警務處於前日（十二）下午五時許、派華越捕偕女抄班員在徐家滙海格路交通大學前面檢查行人之際、有偽警一名、乘自由車而來、因違反交通定章、被巡捕斥責、該偽警不甘示弱、反脣相　而去、旋即進入交通大學內報吿駐在該處之日憲兵隊、遂由憲兵多名擁出、將法捕房之華越捕各一名强行拖入交通大學隊部傍之『警察所』內、經法警務處得報、派員馳往交涉、茲聞此事已山法捕房派員與滬西憲兵司令部職員交涉、結果被拘之華越捕各一名、於當夜八時半即獲釋放、恢復目由、</p>
<p>字林報云</p>
<p>本月十二日午後五時三十分許、『市警』一名、乘自由車馳過法租界海格路交通大學附近、車上未懸照會、有違交通章程、被法警務處華捕一名攔阻、請「市警」隨彼人就近捕房、詎『市警不從、謂此事可赴就近『市警局』解决、</p>
<p>雙方相峙</p>
<p>另有「市警」若干及法租界越捕一名到塲、華捕暨越捕爲免肇事起見、乃隨違章之『市警』入就近『警局』、竟遭扣留、經法警務處高級警官、日憲兵隊官佐及「市府』人員趕抵『警局』調解、至午後八時三十分被扣華越捕各一名、始經釋出、當「警局』內</p>
<p>正調解時</p>
<p>高級華人「官員」之汽車、忽在「警局』外與路人發生口角、好事者圍觀之、「市警」恐羣衆肇　、乃奔出「警局」朝天鳴槍兩響、圍觀者始四散昨（十三日）晨日文某報刊載此訊、內稱「市警』與法租界巡捕開槍互轟一節，頃由法方人士剴切否認、並駁斥法租界巡捕動用槍械之說據　、法租界巡捕與「警局」口角事、</p>
<p>絕無牽涉</p>
<p>又英文大美晚報云、法租界當局及「市府」今（十四日）晨皆宣布雙方警員十二日晚在海格路發生之事件、業已「和睦解決」據法租界某警官稱、此事出於誤會、「市警」名曾朝天開放兩槍、驅散圍覜之大批路人云、</p>
<h3>久旱得甘霖　昨降細雨　但數量甚微</h3>
<p>本埠及四鄕各地、自入夏以來、雨量稀少、尤以最近一月來爲尤甚、土地亢旱、農民均心懷惴惴、茲據平明社記者昨向徐家匯大文台查悉、自五月十七日以來至昨日止、本埠降雨紀綠、爲數之少、實屬空前、共僅二·四公獲、而去年同期、達四九·七公糎之鉅、惟本年自一月一日至昨日止</p>
<p>總共雨量</p>
<p>並不較上年爲少、蓋上年、度歲首以迄六月十四日之降雨總量爲三五二·八公糎、而本年起至昨日止共有三七四·三公糎、故本年總共降雨量、實較往年爲多、但自上月十七日以後、則空前稀少、昨晨五時至昨午三時止、降雨量爲三·五公糎云、因過去雨量之稀少、致河水日淺、</p>
<p>水田龜裂</p>
<p>本埠四鄕各縣如松靑崑太蘇嘉一帶、均爲產米之區、値此泥土乾涸、幾有無秧之苦、以致釀成早象、鄕民日夜戽水灌地、然而隨灌隨乾、地勢較高者、甚至河水亦漸乾涸、因之四鄕農民、頗以旱災爲慮、本埠西鄉之梅隴莘莊七竇及浦東一帶、均爲出產、</p>
<p>早稻區域</p>
<p>望雨尤爲殷切、一般投機米商、明知上海食米存底尙厚、竟又借此藉口、抬高米價、而蔬菜價格、連日亦上漲、同時氣候乾燥、喉症流行、對於人身健康、亦殊有害、是以本埠及四鄕人民、無一不翹首企望、天降甘霖、直至昨晨五時、黑雲滿佈細雨濛濛、時斷時續、至晚仍飄細雨、對於農田大穫稗益、即於人身健康上、亦蒙其利、</p>

<p>外匯昨日市况、匯豐掛牌、悉無上落、英美匯暗市初緊後鬆、惟英美兩匯、走勢仍見背馳、乃上日盛傳美政府、將維持英鎊匯價至四元零二分、不意竟反續小四分至三元七角一分、人心轉變，華銀行傾補美匯、　一度軟至五元　三七五、幸經港電來猛塞、本市華商跟售、始北緊反動回硬、達六　零九三七五、先令逼近四辦士關、爲三辦士九六八七五、美行進出示一、午刻徘徊帶軟、下午港電又售先令、致復帶硬、終爲二辦士九零六二五、及六元零九三七五、英鬆零六二五、美緊零六二五、遠月英長零九三七五、美平致掉期車見軋攏、</p>
<p>英美續形背馳</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條、近遠均　　二五、紐約銀　仍平倫敦生金呆定、匯兌英對美勿　、對滬縮零九三七五、對法求更、美對英跌四分、對滬小　角、對法示改、中央掛牌各匯如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英余　辦十七九零六五、美匯六　零六二五、較上日晚收、英硬零六二五、美則軟零九三七五、乃匯兌吿落之故、開後華銀行頗有吃胃、價　買愈形堅俏、　外行售與華銀行六月份美匯由六元零六二五、至五元九六八七五、並聞現失匯曾喊　五元九三七五、先令亦　三辦士八七五、時約九　二十分、匯豐掛牌揭曉不動、白銀平衡稅揭曉减百分之零·七五、此後投機商來市吐塞、兼港電亦　、市面遂形回鬆、計華投機商及　電　予外行七月份美匯五元九零六二五、又六月份美匯六元與六元零六二五、現貨最鬆則做六元零九三七五、先令長爲三辦士九六八七五、迨近午刻、美行曾對做六月份美匯復吿六元零六一五、致潛勢靜中穩定、收盤並無變化、結果英金三辦士八七五、美匯六元零六二五、本月份與現貨俱見軋平、下月份英金三辦士八四三七五、美匯五元九零六二五、比晨開現貨英微軟零二一二五、美則無榮辱、</p>
<p>港方來電塞出</p>
<p>午後港電續來吐塞、市面初頗軟鬆、計外行吸進六月份英金隨吿三辦士九二一八七五、而六月份美匯外行亦曾對做爲六元零九三七五、、嗣以交易淸稀、上落缺乏、結果英金　辦士九零六二五、美匯六元零九三七五、本月份與現貨同價七月份英金三辦士八四三七五、美匯五元九三七五、較隔昨晚收現貨英硬零九三七五、美反軟零六二五、本月份英長零九三七五、美則縮零三一二五、七月份英亦鬆零九三七五、美無更動、</p>

<h3>供求平衡　金市潛勢甚穩</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗　市况、較爲平凡、以漲跌無山、潛勢甚穩、由供求雖吿平衡、　則始終　於上游、晨　爲五千四百元、且　後市氣仍佳、中以滙市出軟回硬錢兌　即有賣出、降　五千三百二十元、良以金號證券幫　見　俱來猛吸、父高至五千四百五十元、午收卒退至五千四百元、後市爲狀靜寂、交易寥寥、開盤後因金號續購、漲達五千四百四十元、錢兌　塞出金號回吐、　挫七八十元、惟收　重高、達五千三百九十五元、較上日軋升七十元，全天交易積减、約近四千兩、銀樓飾金掛高十元、海關金等仍平、</p>
<p>烚赤漲七十元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初以滙兌　縮、美滙帶緊、開市遂抬七十五元、金號進銀號五十兩、爲五千四百元、　有銀號幫收吸、但斯時錢兌業及散戶均有供意、　價又拉起十元、銀樓幫進錢兌業十兩、爲五千四百十元、旋買者减少、且證券幫亦來賣出、遂告回落九十元、某銀號進同業五十兩、及金號十兩、均爲五千三百二十元、此後賣者杳然、價遂復上、迨盤高至五千　百五十元關時、散　空，急起抵袖、而證券幫金號與銀號幫亦競問收買、立又出五千四百元大關、銀號幫互做二十兩、竟高爲五千四百五十元、後以買戶吃胃轉淡、逐漸回落、錢兌業與證券幫互相拋賣、迨收盤前又退入五千四百元大關、證券幫出銀號十兩、遜爲五千三百八十元後金號對做二十兩、復升爲五千四百元作午收價、收後證券幫忽來拖入、曾做高至五千四百十五元、午後進者缺乏、首由銀號出余號十兩、爲五千四百元、繼因金號幫忽來搜買、而於交易淸稀中、抬起四十元、金號進證券幫二十兩、升爲五千四白四十尤、後進者裹足不前、價遂小支向下、加之錢兌業金號等傾向吐出、而散戶見景拋空、錢兌業出銀號十兩、遜爲五千三百六十元、入後余號忽轉賣爲買、散戶空頭因過夜關係、亦來補進、遂提升三十五元、銀號進余號五十兩、爲五千三百九十五元作晚收價、結果比上日軋漲七十元、全天一百三十元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤較高十數元、收進减低三十元、現標金照掛牌余低五十餘元、均鮮做開、</p>
<p>鉓金掛高十元</p>
<p>銀擇首飾金每兩兌出、、初時大同時仍懸五日五十元、迨至十一時一刻、掛高十元、收後無變化、計大同行改懸五百六十元、新同行與上價相同、收進减低三十元光景、</p>
<h3>外幣昂進</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市况、烚赤盤旋上漲、英美金鎊需要不弱、市價一致回漲二元、金票不乏需要、市價晨跌、午後轉漲、美金票因鎊價視長而反縮、故大衆需要又旺、市價復漲一角、香港票隨港滬滙軋漲二分、日金票供給又　、晚市退爲一元零八分、朝鮮票供塞不鮮、晚市退爲九角三分、</p>
<h3>證劵　內債午後交易　所以較多之原因</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨日市况仍係上午疲、下午堅　以做多者爲利息過高所累、而利用市塲規定、凡下午交易歸次日上午交割、在此一日間內、可以無須收貨、即可以不出利息而做多、以遂其實行搶帽子之技術、在本埠謠言仍盛時、而仍有若隱若顯之和平流宣、市塲人心久經鍛鍊、經騐已多、非普通消息所刺激、昨日經過、買賣各戶仍係隔日了結交易爲多、餘則搶　子亦甚熱鬧、惟通記賣出甲種稍兩注意耳、聯益及聯和亦多出少進、久豐出戊甲、入內種、互相掉換而巳、行市比較稍　、結果比前日除甲種　略小五分外、丁種則全日未開出、餘則略好一二角左右、成交總數共計約八九十萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>異、况　　日之劇漲　幾　十尤）、而回落元餘、亦祇能視爲通常反動、本埠股市經營者、對此不加之意、交易復甚淸淡、經紀人際此時會、設無國際間重大事變、爲是種日趨狹小之營業額作解說、其前途之隱憂將如何、市塲浮多者、大槪俱於事前了淸、故「斬多」景、未見於昨日、英聯股與怡和股佔全日成交總額百分之四十、各股牧盤價較前日與晨開初無二致、橡皮股亦同、</p>
<p>倫教十三日（週四）電、今日英商遠東各公司股票掛牌行市、漲跌互見、麥加利銀行股跌落半鎊、爲七鎊半、有利銀行股上升二先令六便士、價爲十二鎊七先令六便士、其餘吿平、</p>
<p>倫敦十三日（週四一電）今日中國外債掛牌行市、仍吿平平、上下檔各債券槪無變動、</p>
<h3>紗花　廣幫採辦粗紗　雙馬欲跌又止</h3>
<p>紗市平穩、跌風　戢、良以外匯寗靜、而人心安定、同時實銷華南方面、對於十支粗紗納胃殊健、所以情况賴以維持、但一般投機者逢低進、過漲出、因之市塲交易、依然熱鬧也、</p>
<p>現紗晨開、聞美匯趨縮、人氣良好、買風殊佳、二十支雙馬　爲、一千一百四十元、此價一開、賣者尤擁、塲中籌碼較鬆、市盤直跌至一千零九十元、旋以　帮粗紗採辦殷切、外匯父縮、　戶活躍、父復漲至一千一百十四元收證、查半日間成交統計一千二百八十包、行情二十支雙馬跌十三元、今日有棉紗三百件運天津、一百十五件運烟台、六日零九件運香港、茲將各帮口買去之額量分列如左、</p>
<h3>本棉廠需停頓</h3>
<p>本棉交易之淸澹、猶如鳳毛麟角、實終紗市平凡、廠方需要沉悶、加之邇來印美棉花到貨源源而來、所以人氣不振、市面依然靜寂也、僅同行成交印棉思可登棉一百件、價爲，一百十元棧交、</p>
<p>另訊、外棉市價、紐約棉車、昨日晨初先因利物沛開　及高漲之消息傳來、棉價漲起二十餘磅黃、後因華爾街股票價格之軟弱、市况回疲、結果收盤價格、較之上日近期漲三五磅曾、遠期跌落二三磅音、利物浦棉市自五月十七日停止交易、迄今巳將近月、昨日開盤漲起三十餘至七十餘磅音不等</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、目前價格已　穩定狀態、交易亦漸　曙光、唯爲數不巨耳、因歐洲戰局之緊張、棉花運輸、困難加多、同時美棉之步漲、故同業心思父　樂親之傾向矣、</p>
<h3>疋頭　散戶求售　布價續挫　最高時小去三分之一</h3>
<p>國布　昨市續疲、散戶求　殷切、開價一致下挫、惟布　距高峯已减達三分之一弱嚴家間工停工者日增、外棉　漲、紗價轉穩、大戶態度似較鎭靜、因之跌勢巳形緩和、昨散額白貨跌二角半、漂染布跌三五角大盤平平、本街成交漂白淺色夏令布及藍布等三千數百疋粗布坯布二百餘　、浙皖董辦粗布色布洋紗等貨一百餘件、粵滇、辦士林布色斜近百箱、</p>
<p>東布　先漲後疲、龍頭細布晨開三、五元八角、旋以同業資出、步步下游、至午收盤爲三十五元二角後市人心續虛、貿戶寥落降至三十五元、四君子嗶嘰跌至八角九分牛、</p>
<p>出口　疋頭今日有二百三十八、運往香港、又一百二十件、運往天津、又三百八十五件、運往烟臺、</p>
<h3>糧食　米價稍鬆　下午復緊</h3>
<p>米市自前日度回緊後、昨晨開市、忽以天氣陰寒、時雨乍降、人心轉軟、銷塲旣呆、並以新成交之洋米、近二十萬包、人心不無轉平、故洋米價曾落半元光景、若火絞祇售五十四日半、小紋五十二元半、漸由內地鄕莊客戶等一般實銷發動、市面轉呈　旋、延至中市、迨蘭金價回好消息、人心復堅、尤以投搜最黨活　、輩起吸收、形勢轉緊、　時恢復原盤、下午買氣更旺、回籠貨亦復喊高、現米立即步步上晨、小絞米銀行綫上午五十三元二三角者、下午至五十四元、浦東綫上午五十二尤七角者、下午至五十三元半、結果比前晚反漲五七角、</p>
<p>糯米到貨旣稀、棧存不弱、不過銷塲微細、難與他貨抗衡、供求相仿、市面無甚上落、售開各、悉守前朝　盤耳</p>
<p>厚粳等國米、邇來因亢畢關係、內地糙價　貴、引得人心堅昂、致塲外暗幫連日飛漲、造成從未有之高峯、昨則雖已天降甘霖、但傳聞黑市尙難挫其銳氣、一般貨主猶以身本及後貨有限、未肯輕脫、　在扳持、惟幸作客方面、除念於應需者不得巳尙忍受時事添購外、他則已較懈淡、不若前之亟亟、結果售價尙稱平穩、常帮特淸粳仍爲六十四元、南港早稻六十元、僅靑泗高薄稻開六十二元半、略增半元、</p>
<p>洋米不斷來滬、昨日太古公司安慶輪到埠、由香港運來二千五白三十包、又貴陽輪約晨抵滬、自香港裝八千三白十九包、均泊浦東本行碼頭起卸、聞同有大批在途運滬、</p>
<h3>粉市客盤暗緊　小麥來源未疏通</h3>
<p>麵粉　昨市堪吿堅挺、查銷塲方面、除本街零批交易外、客化續有南洋帮問津、北洋帮亦有添辦之意、各廠以目下各地新麥上市巳久、而運滬問題、迄未解決、一面已函請當局設法處置、一面尙在磋商中、蓋前兩日所到嘉定麥與蕪湖麥兩批、均非正式到貨、故原料前途、不無顧慮、聞二號粉廠盤爲維持性質、仍爲十二元八角、而客盤旣到十六元二角半、昨又喊高一角、其他內地雜牌粉與回籠貨供求兩寂、概無正市、小麥來源、迄未正式疏通、故新麥匕市、又吿中斷、</p>
<h3>雜糧　新蠶豆又統制　—豆餅再漲二角—</h3>
<p>新蠶豆目傳統制以來、致來源受其影響、　手貨扳價具常、目南洋　有問津、放市欣欣向榮、計開靠定白黨四百餘包、價爲十八元五角至十九元七角、南翔靑蠶三百餘包、價爲十九元四角、北港靑蠶二百包、價為二十元、九江小粒白蠶一百包、　爲十六元一角、蕪湖小粒白蠶二百包、價爲十八元、</p>
<p>黃豆交易、因豆餅冉漲二角、各方都有辦意、但貨戶緊拉、成交見少、行情盤盤軋漲、統市成交靑島豆三千包、太倉豆八十包、安慶豆三百餘包、桑園豆二白包、蕪湖豆一車、及平湖花皮豆二百餘包、崇明沙黃八九百包、浦東杜豆三十包、又豆子今日有二百十包、運往香港、</p>
<h3>糖市　荷赤開價較宜</h3>
<p>昨糖市初緊後平、結果略小、公會劃盤，現貨二四粗白本棧上午七十元八角、下午退至〇三角、外棧初爲七—元半、旋至六十九元六角、老貨六十九元三角、下午新貨復到七十元、比前日均小一角、轉口貨六月二上日打單五十五元八角至三角、下午五十五元八角至五角、小半元、現貨較軟爲五十五元三角至五十四元”角、太古車白B嘜八十二元半，小五角、聯營處開出荷赤三千五百十四包、進口貨已完稅）五十九元半、轉口貨五十元、太古　粗白照O·I·F例便爲美金三，一九、荷赤二·五六、國糖有建幫開出油决刁靑（日輪到）九十三包、六十　元半、廣幫開條靑百餘箱四十六元、又昨日查港來糖三千五百六十包、夏門來五百四十二包、</p>
<h3>南北貨　龍口綫粉乾　步鬆十餘元</h3>
<p>綫粉干前以銷路活動、龍口粉曾　一百三千餘元、但近以香港　見小、去貨難劃、南洋帮亦無間津、價乃步鬆十餘元、昨市僅售一百十八元、靑島粉亦小十元售九十元、</p>
<h3>靑笋干到稀價昂</h3>

<h3>國婦女的奮起</h3>
<p>— 金剛</p>
<p>歐戰的火燄，使平靜而悠閒的老大英國，起了十餘年來所未有的動盪，在總動員的空氣里，一批批的壯士開向前錢，雄壯的軍歌飄揚在每一個街頭，華貴的我總會不復奏起醉人的音樂了，紳士們都拋了他們長久的美麗的生活，有的服兵役夫了，有的參加各種戰時工作，而無數有着舒服職業的婦女，却一批一批地開始失業了，有了家庭的婦女們，都忍痛含淚離別了親愛的丈夫，連他們自己的孩子，也得一齊撤退到鄉郊去，即使皇后的女兒也沒有　外，眞的，戰爭是殘酷的，使一切人們的生活都改變了內容。</p>
<p>自然，英國在這次國家生死存亡的戰爭中，每一個國民都有他本位的責任，婦女們也與男子們一樣地在後方担當許多戰時服務工作，現在英國的婦女已經有着幾個很重要的組織，一個是「婦女地卞服務隊」，隊員有　萬多人，隊長是海降夫人，隊員們都分佈在各陸軍駐在地，爲士兵們烹飪，洗衣，以及一般慰勞工作，一個是「婦女海眾服務隊」，隊員有　四千人，隊長是勞頓瑪篤夫人，隊員分佈在各軍艦上担任洗滌，洒掃，烹飪，以及許多雜碎工作，一個是「婦女空軍服務隊」隊員有一萬二千多人，隊員都被派在飛行塲做帮助飛行士的許多工作，以及關於工程上的勤務，各隊婦女都和男子們一樣忠心，一樣勇敢地爲國家服務，此外，「婦女志願服務隊」是規模最大的後方婦女服務組織，包括各界婦女隊員五十萬人全國各地都有分隊，「急救護士軍」與「紅十字會護士總隊」是祖任前後方救護工作的婦女紕織，裏面充滿了千萬强健，活躍，勇敢的英國婦女！</p>
<p>這些婦女隊員，一部分是義務的，而且還要自動捐贈經費給團體，部分是國家給于津貼的，有許多都是貴族與富家之婦女，平時都是僕從如雲，一呼百諾的，而今却做了士兵們的服役者，他們忍受着無限辛勞，認爲是無上的光榮！</p>
<p>這幾個婦女服務隊的總司令，就是英國皇后，她負着最高指揮的責任，她是日以繼夜地抽出最寳貴的時間，爲了這些婦女組織的發展與充實而努力，自然，英國的對德抗戰，得力於這些堅强的婦女組織是很大的！</p>

<h3>爭取工作的效能</h3>
<p>— 王韜</p>
<p>許多人是祗知道工作，而不講求效能的。假使他工作是十分，而收到的效能是七分的話，那對他是一個重大的損失。然而這損失還是普遍的存在着，無論在你，在我……以及在廣大的各階層。</p>
<p>雖然我們不希望立刻能够做到「事半功倍」的地步，但我們祗少應該不賠本不吃虧，做十分工作，收十分效能。當然我們希望收十二分甚至十五分的效能，在工作上爭取更大的勝利。</p>
<p>粗看起來，這似乎是一件非常乏味而無聊的事，然而它給我們的益處却是無窮盡的。况且我們處在目前一個非常激盪的大時代裏，無論民族，國家，社會所賦予我們的重任，應該努力的去完成。這無窮的工作，不但需要我們完成，同時我們史應該爭取最大的效能。</p>
<p>我們時常可以看到，一個烟紙店的夥計，整天十二小時以上的工作，但他有一大半的時間却庇閑看馬路上的景緻和無聊的談大上。這不但是時間的耗費，造成工作效能的渺小，而且養成了一種對工作可怕的惰性。這惰性不但僅僅存在於烟紙店夥計的身上，它存在於寫字間蹺起脚來閑談的辦事員，政府機關的公務人員，學校的敎職員，學生……以及一切一切的人。</p>
<p>無論工農兵學商，工作與效能是分不開的。而且這問題正需要我們猛省，考慮，和　行。我們試看，資本主義國家的工廠，資方拚命的壓榨勞方，增加工作時間，甚至每天超過十小時以上，但所收到的效能却是抵不上工作所花費的代價。在蘇聯，因爲他們要爭取較大的效能，因此把工作時間甚至减低至六小時，而他的效能往往是超過工作的。</p>
<p>我們也需要這樣，正如古語所說的一樣——「事半功倍」。第一，我們應該深切瞭解工作的本質，工作時專心於工作；第二，應該有適宜的調劑，整天伏案工作是不會收預期效果的。工作之後我們應該有娛樂，有運動。使我們的工作隨着適當的調節，而把效能提高起來。</p>

<h3>霍桑探案　舞后的歸宿</h3>
<p>— 程小靑著</p>
<p>第一章「一位挺漂亮的小姐！」</p>
<p>他喃喃地說：眞奇怪。金壽兄，你怎麽就想到檢尋槍彈？</p>
<p>倪答道：「這屋子裏的人都說昨夜夜半後聽得了槍聲，才發緊這件兇案。我依着這致命傷的直綫一瞧，便在牆壁上發見了這粒子彈。你們到的時候，我剛才把它箝出來呢。」</p>
<p>霍桑道：「這屋子裏有幾個人，你查問過沒有？」</p>
<p>「我祇約略的談過幾句，還沒有仔細問。道屋子裏的人不多，有個老頭兒叫李芝範，是死者的姑丈。一個女僕叫金梅，還有一個老媽子和一個看鬥的老毛。」</p>
<p>「我想最好先跟那個姑丈談一談—唉，慢米。這烟嘴放在這書桌上，似乎有些不大相稱。」霍桑說時踏前一步，用白巾　着手指，從書桌的一邊，拿起一隻假象牙的烟嘴來。</p>
<p>我乘勢瞧到書桌上面。桌上的東西很簡單，但都很精緻。一隻塗金的刻花墨水盂，有紅藍兩盂，盂蓋都蓋着，兩孟之間有兩個揷筆管，都空無所有，顯見這東西除了權充書案上的點綴品以外，不作別用。一個銀質花瓶也是道地的來路貨，瓶中也沒有　朶花。右手裏有幾本書，都是舞星小誌」「電影月刋」一類的圖畫刊物。正中有一塊綠絨襯墊的厚玻璃，玻璃下面排列了好幾個男女明星的照片。（十五）</p>

<h3>復旦的女子公寓</h3>
<p>— 嘯</p>
<p>復旦女同學會與復旦劇社十二日在靑年會演于伶的話劇「女子公寓，　　劇已有電影甚爲流行。</p>
<p>演員中以客串田太宣的阿媽爲第一據說這位老太太已經六十二歲了，還興致勃勃，可眞不容易：幾句國語，也够漂亮的。動作自然，一點也不像做戲，我起初還當是　的娘姨　走到明星，怪不得這樣的老練！</p>
<p>佩的國語很好，演技大有進步，發音比以前響化裝也此以前好。第一幕吸烟和散步的姿態，很像藍蘭，也許是揣摹得來的。史狄娜的柳麗珠在第二幕吃鎭江名產時極成功。在這緊張的張二幕　浩川（落華生演）的發威和佩佩的蔑視，也都演得極好。</p>
<p>伊得演趙松韻，國語稍差，但那種呆定的神情和悲傷的語曾抓住了台下的觀衆，頓時使得全塲肅靜起來。我看電瑩瑩的眼淚在伊得的眼眶裏轉。假戲眞做，甚爲難得。</p>
<p>冷靜的黃蕙芳自是老手，幾句爲馬虎虎，」尤爲傳神。安藍初次登台，演沙霞尙能稱職，只是國語不十分好。凌子的趙冠英最後哭泣時頗眞切。</p>
<p>男角方面，陳自强似是閩廣人，演　如時雖竭力學國語，似仍有閩廣　音，但已經不很客易，其　頗有幾段流利的。陳蒼的齊維德甚好。老章的牛大王第二幕回憶時稍欠沈著，但最後夫妻相會時，就演得不壞了。落華生的發威我看見他眞的面孔紅漲，好就好在此處。</p>
<p>燈光因爲不熟練之故，有時忽然全暗，應該較準　第三幕一張椅背對着台口，很是聰明。因爲一般裝置都讓　員的臉對着觀衆，這樣好讓觀衆看淸演員的表情，用意本來不錯。但按之事實，却決不會這樣湊巧：所以一張椅背對台口，當爲事實所可能；同時在人物太多時，可以加重主要重心人物的注意，別的演員坐在椅上也可　此略得舒氣和休息的機會。構圖也別有風趣。因此我說這辦法是聰明的。</p>

<h3>關於「唔」女郞　安秀麗丹的種種</h3>
<p>— 鏞</p>
<p>安秀麗丹，是銀幕上聞名的「唔」女郞，說到她的演技，在各位的腦中是早已留下了深刻的印象，所以，亦無需筆者再來介紹。那麽，現在就不妨來談些關於她在銀幕下的私生活的種種狀况，凡是影迷們想必都是樂於聽聞吧</p>
<p>飲食</p>
<p>安秀麗丹　愛咖啡的程度是極深的，有時候，一次竟能連飲達十杯之多呢；在菜肴上，她最愛的是火腿炙內片，對於　豆，她說這是最沒有味道的東西；她自已於烹飪方面亦極有經騐；所以，常常就邀請了朋友們在家中共同進餐。</p>
<p>服裝</p>
<p>在服裝上面呢，安秀麗丹跟着其他明星一樣的，是極求其精緻而美觀；她有着二三十件晚服，做好後就從未穿過：她喜歐穿似男服式的長褲。</p>
<p>睡眠</p>
<p>在每夜就寢之前，安秀麗丹總須橫臥在床上，看一二十頁書，抽一枝烟；這已威了她的習慣，不然，她就不能人眠。此外，還有個習慣，就是她所用的枕頭，必須二三個。</p>
<p>娛樂</p>
<p>安秀麗丹在銀幕下的消遼，運動方面是滑冰及　泳；其他，她又喜歡收集各種花卉及果樹。她常常把所貯積的金錢去買政府的　債，吾則，她就用在　買珠　首飾等類的東西，買來後，她又從不穿帶，她說：「我祗是喜歡買而已！」</p>
<p>願望</p>
<p>她有一個志願，是早夕所希望能够實現的：第一個是希望她在日後可以成功　蓓蒂黛維絲這樣成就偉大的演員。第二個是有　片廣大的牧塲。</p>
<p>迷信</p>
<p>說亦可笑，安秀麗丹也是一個　崇拜迷信的人物；如果把帽子放在床上，或在服裝室內低語閒談，這二件事情，她認爲是要帶來惡運的；在平日，她在手上總帶着一隻瑪瑙的戒指；據她自巳說，這是代表着好運的符咒呢！</p>
<p>安秀麗丹說西班牙語很流利，這一點在好萊塢的明星間，她是引以爲榮的。</p>
<p>擇婚</p>
<p>不多時以前，常常盛傳她要和某入結婚了，爲了這個問題，她發表了下面的幾句話，她說：『我理想中最稱　的男人，他是應該有一種不平凡的志向，性情方面相當帶有點幽默，窮富不論，相貌上祇要是不醜，亦不必要怎樣的漂亮；講到年歲，他的精神及生氣如果是像一個二十一歲的靑年，那麽他眞正的年歲就是在二十五歲及四十五歲間，亦可以不談了。最後，他必須　舞跳得很好。』</p>

<h3>French Troops Reorganize Their Lines; German Troops Enter Paris; German Troops Advance South in the Champagne Region; French Military Authorities Determined to Resist to the End</h3>
<p>Washington - The State Department has just received a telegram from U.S. Ambassador to France, Bullitt, stating that German troops have already entered Paris. (Havas, 14th)</p>
<p>New York - It is learned that news of the entry of German troops into Paris was reported by U.S. Ambassador to France, Bullitt (who remains in Paris), by telephone at 6:00 AM this morning (Greenwich time, which is 3:00 PM Shanghai time) to the Polish Ambassador to France, Patek (currently in Tours, southern France), who then telegraphed the State Department six minutes later. (Havas, 14th)</p>
<p>Somewhere in France - The Commander-in-Chief issued a war bulletin this morning stating, "Enemy troops are advancing rapidly around the outskirts of Paris. Our defending forces have been ordered to withdraw, and Paris has been declared an undefended city. Defending it would only devastate the area and would be of no strategic benefit. As for the front lines in the Champagne region, enemy troops are advancing south. One advance unit appears to be moving towards Romilly (on the Seine River), while another is moving towards Saint-Thierry (on the Marne River). Our troops' operations and movements are orderly and unhurried." (Havas, 14th)</p>
<p>A French army spokesman announced this evening that Paris would be abandoned to avoid devastation, but that French troops would set up defenses south of the city and reorganize their lines to continue the war. Military observers say that German troops have been attacking continuously for ten days and ten nights. The French troops have suffered heavy losses and are extremely fatigued. Supply and replenishment are proving very difficult. Without reinforcements, the defensive positions south of the Seine River may be difficult to hold for long. (Havas, 13th)</p>
<p>Paris - It is reported that the French cabinet met last night and decided to continue resistance to the end. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>Paris - The Supreme Military Council has decided that even if the Germans cross the Seine and advance towards Versailles with three times the number of French troops, the French army will still fight to the end. It is reported that British reinforcements will soon arrive at the front to join forces with the French army. (International News Service, 14th) The French General Headquarters issued a war bulletin this evening stating, "The fighting around Paris is becoming increasingly fierce. (1) To the west, fresh enemy troops are attacking south of Rouen. Their motorized troops have already reached the bridgeheads of Louviers and Vernon, and are advancing towards Pacy-sur-Eure and Évreux. Évreux and Dreux have been bombed by enemy aircraft. (2) To the north, at least twelve enemy divisions are attacking between Senlis and Betz. (3) To the east, enemy armored divisions have crossed the Marne River between Château-Thierry and Dormans, advancing towards Montmirail. Other enemy divisions are advancing east of Reims towards Châlons-sur-Marne. In all, the enemy has an estimated one hundred divisions from the coast to the Meuse River. Our troops, although fewer in number, are bravely resisting." (Havas, 13th)</p>
<p>London - Although the situation in the abandoned suburbs of Paris is serious, the general public is most concerned about the precarious situation of the French troops south of Reims. According to a Reuters correspondent, German troops in that area, reinforced by armored divisions, are trying to isolate the Maginot Line from General Weygand's mobile forces. Unfortunately, the terrain there is similar to undulating plains, suitable for tank warfare. If bombers cannot stop the German armored vehicles, the German forces in that area will become a serious threat. German troop movements elsewhere on the front are being severely disrupted by the constant activity of the Royal Air Force. German heavy artillery near Saint-Valery has fallen silent. A French communique acknowledged the abandonment of Paris, stating that due to increased German pressure, the troops covering Paris had withdrawn to both sides of the city as ordered. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>Paris - A spokesman for the French Army announced that the French General Headquarters had no intention of fighting within Paris. If French troops were forced to continue retreating, they would engage in battle in the suburbs north of Paris and then reorganize continuous lines of defense immediately behind Paris. The French army is now resisting with the greatest determination, but they are facing an enemy that is superior in numbers, weapons, and aircraft. Many French divisions have been fighting for ten days without rest, while the Germans have reinforcements every two or three days. Physical fatigue is now having an impact, especially during combat. Most troops often have to defend distances of up to sixty miles. The spokesman added that French losses were quite heavy and that it was not possible to send reinforcements. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>Berlin - Officials here announced this morning that German troops have now entered Paris. (Haitong, 14th)</p>
<p>Berlin - At 1:00 PM today, the German people joyfully listened to the broadcast announcing the German occupation of Paris. Everyone raised flags to celebrate. Führer Hitler issued an order for the entire country to fly flags for three days to show respect for German soldiers. Churches throughout Germany rang their bells for fifteen minutes, and people gathered in the streets, singing the national anthem and forgetting their fatigue. (Haitong News Agency, 14th)</p>
<p>Berlin - Le Havre has been occupied by German troops. (Haitong News Agency, 14th)</p>
<h3>Large Unit of Italian Troops Head to Germany for Reinforcement</h3>
<p>London - A Reuters military correspondent reports that, according to unofficial sources, a large unit of Italian troops arrived in Germany some days ago, indicating that Italy is indeed participating in the war because the German side needs reinforcements. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<h3>French Government Moves to Bordeaux</h3>
<p>New York - British radio has just reported that the French government has moved from Tours to Bordeaux. (United Press, 14th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Handling Food Shortages During the Lean Season</h3>
<p>Recently, rice prices have once again shown an upward trend, with japonica rice being hoarded particularly severely, reaching over sixty yuan on the black market. Although foreign rice has arrived from time to time, it is also selling for fifty-five or fifty-six yuan. Flour is selling for thirteen yuan and eight jiao on this street, while sales to customers have already reached over sixteen yuan. This is the staple food of the people, and we have indeed re-entered a dangerous area. Some consider this to be a natural phenomenon, as we have already reached the lean season. The seasonal trend of the Shanghai rice market has been for prices to gradually rise in June and July, and then gradually decrease in October. Moreover, the situation this year cannot be compared with previous years. According to historical rice prices, although prices rise in this season in a timely manner, flour prices are adjusted invisibly because the wheat harvest has been completed. However, this year, although the new wheat has been harvested, flour mills cannot obtain new wheat, or the amount available is limited. This is because "control" has created a monopoly, making procurement difficult and transportation extremely uncertain. The mechanized flour industry yesterday appealed to the Public Works Department, attempting to increase the price of flour sold on this street. There are those who can find excuses for this. Since flour prices are not reduced with the arrival of new wheat, the actual severity of the situation is that it has lost its function of adjusting the people's food supply, which affects the rice market. This is not just about the price of rice in Shanghai rising steadily. It is said that rice prices in the Ningbo-Shaoxing area are as high as over one hundred yuan, because Ningbo-Shaoxing is a region with a dense population and scarce grain, relying on the rivers and seas for supply. Now, the river crossing between Hangzhou and Haining has been interrupted, and maritime transport between Shanghai and Ningbo is mostly obstructed. In addition, Xiaoshan has fallen, and Japanese troops are gathering, requisitioning grain on the spot, which is enough to deprive the people of food. It is appropriate for grain prices to rise. Rice prices in the Hangzhou-Jiaxing occupied area are as high as over sixty yuan. Recently, rice shops along the Pudong River have been forced to close down imperceptibly. The reason is that each rice shop in Pudong purchases rice from various Yu counties. When passing through the Huangpu River, they must compulsorily purchase half of it at a price of thirty-seven yuan per picul to be used as military rice. Rice merchants have suffered heavy losses as a result, and are unable to bear the burden. Their appeals have fallen on deaf ears, so although they remain open, they have no rice to sell. In addition, the Su-Xi-Chang area was originally a rice-producing region, but now prices are limited, and rice is purchased on a large scale, in batches of tens of thousands of piculs. During the period of the search, others are not allowed to purchase. As a result, the producing areas must also eat expensive rice. Not only is the price expensive, but the source is also exhausted. As a result, all rice for consumption in various places relies on foreign rice. In the current situation, there is no fear of interruption of foreign rice in Shanghai. However, rice merchants take advantage of the opportunity to treat this as a rare commodity. Furthermore, speculative profiteers agitate the people, often claiming that the weather has been dry for a long time and will affect the future rice harvest, creating opportunities for manipulation. They do not know that the season has just entered the mold. Yesterday, there was drizzling rain, a typical sign of the mold season. The end of the mold is on July 15th. There is a month of effort. Whether the amount of rainfall is large or small is still uncertain, so the recent complaints about the clear weather are not enough to be seen as hindering rice planting. There is no need to worry about a bad harvest. Shanghai has plenty of rice in storage, but rice prices continue to rise. This is an undeniable case of artificial manipulation and hoarding.</p>
<p>For many years, this newspaper has always believed that the treatment of the people's food supply should take into account the principles of both agriculture, commerce and the people's food supply, in order to seek appropriate handling. It is hoped that through continuous mutual benefit, a permanent mutual assistance can be formed. If one is concerned about one thing and loses sight of the others, then even if the temporary benefit is widespread, it cannot be sustained. As for the current handling of the people's food supply, it is limited by the environment and naturally unable to realize ideal adjustments. One can only abandon the fundamental and pursue the superficial. First, seek the stability of the market. Market stability may not be able to completely stabilize prices, but at least it can prevent instability caused by artificial manipulation. This is one. Food control is difficult in the current concession situation, but it cannot be allowed to be difficult and abandoned, putting the people's food problem out of mind. We should consider the difficulties faced by the public in obtaining food within the scope of our possible responsibilities and powers, and separately find ways to solve them appropriately. This is two. Merchants seek profit as their aim. They will move if there is profit, and retreat if there is no profit. Speaking of profiting and hoarding, disregarding the people's livelihood, the facts are all the same. It is not only the rice merchants who are unforgivable. Moreover, merchants transport goods. High prices can attract goods from afar. If those who transport goods are not given benefits, they will stop moving forward, which will cause concern for the people's food supply. Therefore, the legitimate interests of merchants should be protected, but excessive exploitation must be stopped to maintain the people's livelihood. This is three. Therefore, what can be done for the people's food supply today still lies in what this newspaper has always advocated, that is, centralized buying and selling, open evaluation, the abolition of price limits that exist in name only, and thoroughly handling the registration of food. In particular, we must be realistic and not just make statements that end up being empty words. Within the limit, allow free operation. Those who violate the prohibitions and hoard goods privately should be severely punished without leniency. It is necessary to ensure that there is no market outside the market, and to seek uniformity within the market. Buying and selling should be based on actual sales, with cash as the basis. If futures trading cannot be avoided, it should be limited to actual orders from foreign firms. Recently, the so-called "speculative hoarding" and "passing the buck" in the rice market are all evils of the rice market and must be strictly prohibited. In short, the market should return to normal and not be manipulated by speculation. However, this is only the preliminary method for stabilizing food prices and is not enough to discuss fundamental solutions. It is said that for the people's food supply to work well, first, the authorities must make up their minds and be determined. This is called policy. Second, a practical plan must be formulated and a sound organization constructed. This is called technique. Third, it must be entrusted to loyal and capable talents, because having a system of governance without the people to govern is simply to see that laws cannot operate on their own. Once these three are roughly prepared, then we can talk about further measures.</p>
<p>U.S. Ambassador Remains in Paris to Assist with the Transfer of City Affairs</p>
<p>Washington - The U.S. State Department issued the full text of a telegram from U.S. Ambassador to France, Bullitt, which was forwarded to Berlin at the request of the French authorities. The telegram notified the German army that Paris was an undefended city and that troops were withdrawing. Bullitt will remain in Paris to provide any possible assistance to ensure that the city government can function without loss of life. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>Paris - The Paris Police Commissioner, Langeron, recently issued a notice to residents stating that the police authorities would continue to ensure their safety as before, and that they were confident that the personnel of all public utilities would also continue to perform their duties, "until the very last moment." (Havas, 13th) According to diplomatic sources in Geneva, the Governor of Paris, Herrin, after meeting with the city council, decided to declare Paris an undefended city, leaving only a small number of police to maintain order. This decision was made in view of the public's demand for surrender and the overwhelming public sentiment, which was difficult to resist. Therefore, despite Prime Minister Reynaud's opposition, Paris was declared an undefended city to avoid a German military attack on Paris. (Haitong, 14th)</p>
<p>Berlin - Regarding the French radio station's claim that Paris is an undefended city, Berlin officials have not yet commented. It is not yet known whether the French authorities have formally notified the German command. Berlin welcomes Paris to follow the example of Brussels and avoid repeating the tragedy of Warsaw, so as not to turn the capital into a battlefield. (Haitong, 14th)</p>
<p>Paris Armaments Factories Move to Southern Regions</p>

It is reported that these armaments will be moved to a new "Maginot Line" to continue working, where they cannot be attacked by enemy planes. Observers say that once the various machines and tools are assembled, the factories can resume work, so that arms manufacturing will not be delayed. (Havas, 12th)</p>

<p>London - Just after 7:00 AM today, telephone communication between here and Paris was not completely cut off, but there was an "indefinite delay." Those who had scheduled calls were generally not being accepted. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>London - The British government has sent a telegram to the French government stating that, in this critical time, for the sake of the freedom and democracy that both countries uphold, the British government wishes to express its admiration for the courage, endurance, and perseverance shown by the French army in its battle against overwhelming odds. Their efforts are worthy of France's most glorious traditions and have inflicted deep and lasting wounds on the enemy's strength. Britain is willing to continue to provide the greatest possible assistance. We now take this opportunity to declare the inseparable unity of the two nations and the two empires. We cannot measure the various hardships that will befall our peoples and nations in the near future, but we are determined that this fiery crucible will forge the two nations into an invincible entity. We now reaffirm our pledge to the French Republic and resolve to spare no sacrifice, to continue the fight in France, on the island, on the sea, and in the sky, wherever it may lead us, using all our resources to the utmost, and to jointly bear the burden of repairing the scars of war. We will never retreat from the war until France is able to stand tall in all its majesty, until the countries and nations that have been insulted and enslaved are liberated, and until civilization has escaped the scourge of Nazism. On this day of dawning light, we are even more assured that the dawn will come sooner than we have a right to hope for. (Reuters, 14th)</p>

<h3>German War Bulletin</h3>
<p>Berlin - German military experts yesterday issued a supplementary war bulletin report to Haitong Foxconn, stating that after eight days of fierce fighting in northern France, the German army has crossed the Marne River, crossed the battlefields of the World War, and pursued the defeated and retreating enemy troops, capturing countless military equipment and prisoners. (Haitong, 14th)</p>
<p>Berlin - The fighting on the Rhine River upstream near the Swiss border has become intense. The fighting was initiated by French artillery fire, which was met with a fierce German artillery response. (Haitong, 14th)</p>
<p>Berlin - Military leaders here said that Allied Commander-in-Chief General Weygand would be unable to continue maintaining the front line and making an orderly retreat from Paris, as the rapid German advance had encircled the city. They said that General Weygand's current predicament was different from that of the Republican army during the Spanish Civil War and that he was unable to make a safe retreat like the Spanish Republican army. It is reported that Führer Hitler has moved his headquarters closer to Paris in the past few days, but news of the Führer's whereabouts was not available here last night. According to German officials last night, 100,000 Allied soldiers have been captured since June 5th, and Allied equipment, especially tanks, has been destroyed or seized. The number far exceeds the Allied production. Although the German army's air force was hindered by the bad weather, many strongholds that had crossed the Marne River had been taken. After some resistance, the Allied forces hastily retreated from several strongholds. According to German sources, the war spoils captured by the German army cannot be counted at present. When 26,000 British and French troops surrendered at Saint-Valery, a large amount of military equipment was seized. Because of the cliffs along the English Channel, the Allied forces were unable to escape the German encirclement by boarding ships there. The German air force bombed the Allied transport ships, and military sources said that the ships were transporting troops at other strongholds along the coast. (United Press, 14th)</p>
<p>Hitler's Headquarters - This afternoon's German war bulletin stated that the entire French defense line between the English Channel and the Maginot Line has collapsed. The French attempt to defend Paris has been shattered. The German army has now won and entered Paris. (Haitong, 14th) Berlin - The second phase of the great Western War has ended victoriously for the German army. The resistance of the French Northern Army has been defeated. The German army has crossed the Seine, and Le Havre has been occupied. The French army from Paris to the Maginot Line near Sedan is retreating as a whole. German tanks and mechanized troops have charged through the defeated enemy troops and are moving beyond them. The enemy has abandoned a large amount of military equipment. The enemy troops defending Paris are no longer capable. German troops have entered Paris this morning. Last night, the German army attacked Dead Man's Hill northeast of Verdun and reoccupied Montmédy, which is also an important pillar of the Maginot Line. The German army has now begun the third phase of the war, which aims to clear out the remaining enemy troops to complete the final victory. This morning, the German army began a frontal attack on the Maginot Line along the Saar border. German fighter planes and low-flying bombers bombed enemy concentrations, railway stations, railways, and airfields all day long, causing heavy damage. German aircraft sank two French transport ships near Le Havre and damaged three others, one of which was 10,000 tons. North of Le Havre, German anti-aircraft guns sank an enemy military transport ship and damaged three others. Under pressure from German artillery fire, a British destroyer, which was sailing away, turned back. According to statistics, the Allies lost 19 planes yesterday, three of which were shot down in air combat and three by anti-aircraft fire. The rest were destroyed on the ground. Two German planes are missing. Yesterday, a German submarine sank a supporting cruiser (17,000 tons), and another submarine sank a 11,000-ton transport ship. (Haitong, 14th)</p>
<p>Berlin - Hitler met with American journalist Wiegand at the Western Front headquarters today and said that he had never intended to destroy the British Empire. On the contrary, before the outbreak of the war, he had proposed to the British government to provide assistance to maintain the position of the British Empire, but it was not accepted. Of course, the outcome of this war will inevitably lead to the destruction of some things. The capitalist group's pursuit of its own interests will destroy millions of lives, but I think this result will be created by its own people and not promoted by us. (Haitong, 14th)</p>

<h3>Japanese Offensive in Western Hubei Fails - Dangyang County Recaptured - Main Force of Japanese Troops Surrounded West of Yaque Ridge - Chinese Forces Hold Absolute Advantage on the Hanyi Road</h3>
<p>Yichang - After recapturing Yuan'an, the brave Chinese troops continued to press south. At the same time, the large Chinese army advancing south from northern Hubei also crossed the Zhexi River, closely following the Japanese in Dangyang, and launched a fierce attack on the Japanese flank. They surrounded the main force of the Japanese army in the area west of Yaque Ridge. This time, the Japanese army rashly invaded westward and suffered heavy blows from the Chinese army. Over 6,000 Japanese troops have been annihilated in recent days. The Japanese troops trailing the Chinese forces are in great pain and unable to resist. Most of the Japanese are now retreating along the river. The Chinese army took advantage of the victory to recapture Dangyang County. At 2:00 PM, heavy rain began along the entire line, and Japanese aircraft lost their ability to operate, which greatly demoralized the Japanese. The Chinese army on the Hanyi Road now holds an absolute advantage. It will not be difficult to completely annihilate the Japanese troops on the west bank of the Xiang River. (Reported on the 14th)</p>
<p>Yichang - The Chinese army has taken the advantage in the fighting on the Hanyi Road. Yesterday, a large detachment of Japanese troops from Dangyang invaded westward and engaged in fierce fighting with the Chinese army in the Yaque Ridge area. After five hours of bloody battle, the Japanese gradually showed signs of collapse. The Chinese army intensified the pressure, and the Japanese retreated in defeat at noon on the 13th. As soon as the Chinese army arrived, they launched a fierce attack on the Japanese occupying Yuan'an, besieging them all day. The Japanese fled eastward. Yuan'an has now been recaptured by the Chinese army. (Reported on the 13th)</p>

<p>Hong Kong - According to foreign sources here, fierce fighting occurred in the northeastern suburbs of Yichang yesterday and the day before. Japanese aircraft, in formations of three to five, continuously bombed the area in shifts. Large fires broke out in several places. Residents in the suburbs of the city had already evacuated to safe areas. As of late last night, the Chinese army was still fighting fiercely. The Japanese brigade of over 10,000 men that attacked the outskirts of Yichang has had its retreat cut off by the Chinese army. They are carrying very few military supplies, and their position is trapped in a Chinese encirclement. The battle situation is expected to develop anew within days. At the same time, the main force of the Japanese army on the Hanyi Highway has encountered strong resistance from the Chinese army and the thorough destruction of transportation, making it very difficult for the Japanese to march forward, so there has been little progress.

<h3>Gospel for Poor Children in Chengdu: Completion of the Construction of the Child Welfare and Treatment Center</h3>
<p>Chengdu - French doctor Bessan has been in Sichuan for eleven years and has a natural sympathy for China. Especially, he has friendship with all circles in Sichuan.

The nine buildings have been completed and can accommodate 120 beds. There is also an isolation ward. Dozens of sick children have been admitted for treatment. Poor adults in the vicinity can also seek outpatient medical treatment. This precious sympathy is deeply regrettable. (Reported on the 14th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Aircraft Tragically Bomb Chinese Civilians - U.S. Government Strongly Condemns - U.S. Property in Chongqing Suffers Losses - Ambassador Grew Lodges Protest with Japan</h3>
<p>Washington - U.S. Secretary of State Hull issued a statement yesterday, "denouncing" the tragic bombing of Chinese civilians by Japanese aircraft. In response to questions about the Japanese bombing of Chongqing, Hull stated that according to official and unofficial information received by the State Department, Chongqing has been indiscriminately bombed by Japanese aircraft in the past few days. Yesterday, the city was again indiscriminately bombed by over 100 Japanese aircraft. Hundreds of Chinese civilians were killed and injured. Several American homes, including churches and schools, were destroyed by the explosions. Two formations of Japanese aircraft flew over the American Embassy, but did not drop bombs in the vicinity. Hull continued, the attitude and position of the American people and government regarding the indiscriminate bombing of civilians by Japanese aircraft have been repeatedly and clearly announced. We will denounce the indiscriminate bombing of civilians by Japanese aircraft anytime and anywhere. (United Press, 14th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - The U.S. government recently protested to the Japanese Foreign Ministry regarding the frequent bombing of Chongqing by Japanese aircraft, which has put part of American property in the city in a precarious situation, and part of it has even been destroyed. The protest was personally delivered to Japanese Foreign Minister Arita by U.S. Ambassador to Japan Grew. Ambassador Grew also informed the Japanese Foreign Minister of the remarks made to the American press by U.S. Secretary of State Hull yesterday, which strongly condemned the indiscriminate bombing of Chinese civilians by Japanese aircraft. (United Press, 14th)</p>
<p>Washington - The U.S. State Department made it clear yesterday that if Japan wants to improve its relations with the United States, its bombing of Chongqing is a misstep. U.S. Secretary of State Hull, when speaking to reporters yesterday about the U.S.'s long-held stance of condemning and opposing air strikes on civilians, spoke solemnly and with emotion. He also expressed the same sentiments when discussing the repeated air raids on Chongqing, emphasizing the indiscriminate and cruel nature of each air raid. Hull said that if anyone asked whether the United States intended to implement an embargo on machine tools and scrap iron to express its disgust, he did not want to say anything further at this time. He still believed that the embargo provisions in the May proposal did not conflict with the policy of mutual trade agreements, because the embargo provisions were to protect military-related national defense supplies. His previous remarks on this topic had paved the way for possible action when the proposal became law.</p>
<p>A diplomatic affairs writer for Scripps and Howard newspapers strongly opposed any "deal" between the United States and Japan yesterday. If Japan's wishes were accommodated, the Japanese would no longer pay attention to promises in new treaties, as was the case with Japan's entry into "Manchukuo" and its disregard for treaty obligations by fortifying the mandated islands. This "deal" would be a fatal blow to the United States, just as the Munich Agreement was to the Allied powers, because it would be tantamount to implying that the third major democracy was intimidated.

<h3>U.S. Far East Policy Still Too Weak - Japan's Ambitions Unsatisfied - Allowing a Malignancy to Grow Will Cause Trouble</h3>
<p>Salottesville - Walter Feele, Secretary of the American College of the Pacific International Relations Society, delivered a speech today, criticizing the weakness of U.S. Far East policy and warning in strong terms that Japan will take advantage of the difficulties in Europe to expand its influence in Southeast Asia. Mr. Feele said that while the U.S. is aiding China in the Sino-Japanese War, why is it also aiding Japan? This U.S. Far East policy is truly baffling. Today, the prolonging of the Sino-Japanese War is undoubtedly due to the U.S. Without the supply of U.S. military supplies, how could Japan engage in such large-scale aggression? If China did not have U.S. moral support and financial loans, whether China could continue its war would also be a question. Feele continued that U.S. public opinion is now demanding that the U.S. government adopt strong measures in the Far East. It must be understood that the exposure of weakness by Britain, France, the U.S., and the Soviet Union in the Far East will allow Japan to do as it pleases and expand the area of war. If the U.S. allows Germany's Far East opponent to control East Asia and the resource-rich colonies, will the position of the Western Hemisphere be even more dangerous? "Japan will take this opportunity to further expand its aggression in China and spread the war to the colonies of Southeast Asia. Japan dares to do whatever it wants only because of the weakness of Britain, the U.S., France, and the Soviet Union. If there were a strong enemy in front of it, Japan would never dare to act recklessly." (United Press, 14th)</p>
<h3>Japan Intends to Invade the Dutch East Indies - Nomura's Visit to Southeast Asia Draws Attention</h3>
<p>Manila - Southeast Asia, which has become one of the world's raw material storehouses, is paying close attention to the attitude of the United States, because people in the area believe that if the U.S. joins the European War, it will have a significant impact on the Far East. People in the Dutch East Indies now hope that the U.S. fleet will be stationed in Hawaii to maintain the status quo of the Dutch East Indies. Many Dutch observers believe that once the U.S. enters the war, the U.S. fleet will inevitably be transferred to the Atlantic, which will allow Japan, the world's third-largest naval power, to dominate the Pacific. Dutch political observers pointed out that although Japanese personnel are greatly weakened by three years of war in China, the Japanese Navy has not participated in the Chinese war and remains intact. If the Japanese Navy believes there is an opportunity to take advantage, it will inevitably engage in military action in the Dutch East Indies in the hope of compensating for the losses of three years of war in China. Currently, general attention is being paid to the news spread by the Japanese side that British troops are landing in the Dutch East Indies and that Foreign Minister Nomura will visit the Dutch East Indies and the Philippines. Authorities in Manila do not believe that Japan can provoke the U.S. at this time, but they believe that Japan will adopt various peaceful means to expand trade in Southeast Asia. As for the Philippine officials, they remain silent on the Japanese reports that Foreign Minister Nomura will come to the former Philippines to discuss immigration laws. It is recalled that the Japanese side believed that the new immigration law, which limited the number of Japanese immigrants from 12,000 per year to 500 per year, was discriminatory against the Japanese.

<h3>Japanese Ship Shot - Japan Prepare to Protest to the Netherlands</h3>
<p>Tokyo - Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman Suma recently confirmed reports that a Dutch ship shot a Japanese fishing boat in Dutch East Indies waters and said that the Japanese government would protest to the Dutch government. Suma also said that it was not yet known whether the location of the incident was definitely in Dutch territorial waters. Regarding the news spread by Tokyo newspapers yesterday that Foreign Minister Nomura would visit the Dutch East Indies, Suma replied to reporters' inquiries that Nomura's visit to the Dutch East Indies and the Philippines was a private action and had nothing to do with the Japanese government (United Press, 16th)</p>
<h3>Japan's Invasion of China Depletes Financial Resources - Reserves Less Than 100 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>Washington - Washington officials estimate that Japan's gold reserves have been reduced to less than 110 million yuan, but they are greatly puzzled by the fact that Japan continues to use gold to pay for goods. Although the Bank of Japan continues to list its reserve amount as 1,640,000,000 yuan (this amount has been listed in Japanese books since December 1938 and has never changed), officials here estimate that Japan's gold is less than 110 million yuan. In 1939, Japan paid the U.S. a total of 200 million yuan for goods, mostly in gold. Japan imported a total of 166,000,000 yuan worth of gold to the U.S. in 1939, and another 55 million yuan worth of gold in the first three months of 1940. U.S. officials, who had expected Japan's gold supply to be rapidly depleted, were baffled by the amount of gold that Japan continued to import to the U.S. One explanation is that Japan had secretly stored a large amount of gold long ago in preparation for a possible war with the Soviet Union, and is now using this reserve to pay for its war against China. It is estimated here that Japan produces no more than 62 million yuan worth of gold each year, and the ability of its foreign trade to obtain foreign exchange has also shown signs of decline.

<h3>U.S. President Responds to Reynaud - Provides Extensive Aid to the Allied Forces - Congress Expedites Legislative Procedures - to Supply Surplus Military Supplies to Britain and France</h3>
<p>Washington - In response to French Premier Reynaud's appeal for aid, President Roosevelt reiterated the U.S.'s promise of full assistance to the Allied forces in a message to the French Premier last night, saying that the U.S. would provide the Allied forces with material resources to the best of its ability. The White House announced last night that the original text of the French Premier's appeal to President Roosevelt had not yet been received, but the U.S. was already doing its best to transport military supplies to France. The White House also said that there would be no comment here on the French Premier's letter to President Roosevelt, as it was of a personal nature. Before French Premier Reynaud's appeal was released, President Roosevelt had already promised to provide extensive aid to the Allied forces. Although President Roosevelt's speech in Salottesville was pre-planned, it completely answered Reynaud's appeal. According to news from Paris, while President Roosevelt was responding to Reynaud, Premier Reynaud was also broadcasting to the U.S., repeating his appeal to Washington. (United Press, 14th)</p>
<p>Washington - As President Roosevelt responded to French Premier Reynaud's urgent appeal, promising to do his best to aid the Allied forces, the U.S. Congress also accelerated its legislative procedures to help the Allied forces defeat the German army in France. As a result of a joint meeting of the Senate and House of Representatives yesterday, they unanimously agreed to pass a bill authorizing the President to sell surplus military supplies to the Allied forces. The bill also removes the restrictions on the number of army aircraft that the President can supply to the Allied forces, and authorizes the President to exercise a blockade of military supplies and machinery to distinguish it from the prohibition of the export of munitions and machinery to Japan.

<h3>French Premier Appeals Again to America, Hoping the US Will Seize the Opportunity to Provide Effective Assistance</h3>
<p>From a Certain Place in France: Premier Reynaud delivered a radio address last night, announcing that he had sent a second appeal to US President Roosevelt. A translation of his address is as follows:</p>
<p>"At this critical juncture, I wish to first inform the world of the bravery of our nation's troops and the valor of our soldiers and their officers. I have personally witnessed soldiers returning from the front lines of Qian [likely a typo, intended as 'front'] fighting as they retreated, constantly harassed by enemy aircraft, having not slept for five days. The enemy believes they can break the spirit of these men, but they still hold steadfast confidence in the ultimate outcome of the war, and have not the slightest doubt about the future of the nation. The heroic deeds of our army in the battle of Dunkirk earlier this month have already been praised by the world. However, the valor displayed in the recent battles from the coast to the Argonne area surpasses even that. This shows that the soul of France has not been conquered and that our nation will never yield under foreign aggression. For thousands of years, we have repelled or conquered aggressors countless times on the land where we live. Moreover, our country has made great contributions to humanity in the past, so everyone should know that they owe a great debt to France, and the time to repay that debt has come. The French army is now the vanguard of all democratic nations' armies. The French army is sacrificing itself. Even if we are defeated now, it will be enough to inflict a major blow on the common enemy of all nations. For example, countless enemy tanks have been destroyed, countless enemy aircraft have been shot down, their personnel losses have been heavy, and many of their gasoline tanks have been hit and set on fire. All of this is enough to affect the morale of the German people. Therefore, at this moment, a wounded France has the right to ask something of other democratic nations, and I firmly believe that no one with a sense of justice can refuse. However, agreeing is one thing, and taking action is another. The great American nation has always valued ideals, and we know this well. In this situation, should our great American friend hesitate any longer in declaring opposition to Nazi Germany? I asked President Roosevelt about this yesterday, and I now wish to make a second appeal, which is also the last appeal. In the past, every time I asked President Roosevelt to step up aid to us within the limits permitted by American law, the President has always been generous in doing so, and the American people have always approved of it. I am deeply grateful for your kindness and friendship. But the problem is no longer so simple at this moment. Today is a matter of the survival of France. If the current war becomes increasingly difficult, there is no point in carrying on unless the hope of mutual benefit becomes increasingly strong. For example, the quality of the British Air Force is excellent, which has already been proven by facts, but if we want to crush the evil forces that are oppressing Europe, we need a constant supply of military aircraft from across the Atlantic. In short, although the front lines of the democratic nations have suffered setbacks, they still possess infinite power. Therefore, we hope that the time for the democratic nations to use all their power to engage in a full-scale battle is approaching. This is why our hearts are full of hope. This is why we have decided that France must maintain a free government, and therefore must abandon Paris. Because Hitler's intention is to eliminate our legitimate government, so as to proclaim to the world that France no longer exists, and then organize a puppet government, just as he has done in other countries. In order to prevent this conspiracy, we must withdraw from Paris. According to historical records, our nation has never been moved by the words of defeatists when it has suffered major setbacks. This is the greatness of our nation. No matter what happens in the future, the French nation is determined to endure hardship and persevere to the end. In other words, we will never fail the glorious history of France. We must love each other like brothers and sisters, and fight with all our strength for the revival of our wounded motherland," (Havas News Agency, 14th).</p>
<h3>Two Coincidental Events</h3>
<p>Washington: Today, the White House announced that President Roosevelt's recent speech in Charlottesville was generally regarded as a response to French Premier Reynaud's appeal for American assistance. In fact, the French Premier's telegram was only presented after Roosevelt returned from Charlottesville, so the fact that his speech was aimed at the French Premier was merely a coincidence. According to reports, President Roosevelt delivered a speech at the University of Virginia on June 10, saying that the United States should provide material resources to those who resist force. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<h3>Struggle Between Old and New Systems</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden: The "Aftonbladet" newspaper reported that President Roosevelt has had a strong reaction to Italy, and the issue is no longer about American neutrality. What we are witnessing now is a struggle between two systems, the old and the new, in the world. Behind President Roosevelt's words lies the actual value of American material resources. Moreover, President Roosevelt has realized that the United States may, in the near future, abandon its non-belligerent status. The serious defeat of France or the attack on Britain will determine whether the United States will intervene. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<h3>Sending Troops Unlikely</h3>
<p>Washington: It is reported that Reynaud's appeal telegram will arrive tonight, and its content is expected to be a request for military assistance. However, President Roosevelt declared that "the United States has done all it can." Observers here believe that, judging from the tone of Reynaud's telegram, if the United States does not urgently send a large number of warplanes to help, France may succumb soon. Official opinion is that if the Allies do not disintegrate, even if France and Britain are conquered, a "no surrender" policy will make the entire Eastern Hemisphere a battlefield. However, there are no signs that President Roosevelt will send an expeditionary force, as he has repeatedly stated that the government does not want to send troops to Europe.

<h3>Evacuation of Residents in Northern France: Refuge Like a Tide, Orderly Along the Way</h3>
<p>London: A Reuters correspondent accompanying the British Air Force in France described in detail the large-scale evacuation of residents from Paris and other places in northern France, saying, "I drove through the crowd for over fifty miles and witnessed refugees fleeing like a tide. The patience of these refugees is admirable. I personally saw many people lining up in front of a gas station waiting to buy gas, with no one pushing or shoving. Although the gas was about to run out, everyone got a little. Damaged vehicles were also being repaired by someone. All the hotels had 'Full' signs hanging up, and those who arrived later had to leave with a look of disappointment, without complaining or demanding a place. The same was true for restaurants and shops. Those who arrived late and could not get food or goods also did not complain. Although the refugees all looked tired, there were few tears. Children sitting among the luggage showed smiles, as if indicating that they did not feel pain from the long journey. The elderly fell asleep due to exhaustion, and their wrinkled and resolute faces seemed to maintain their determination even in their sleep. Most of the vehicles driven by the refugees carried two things: a leather rug, to be used as a makeshift bed when there was nowhere to stay, and a bicycle, to be used as a temporary means of transportation in case the car broke down or the horses were overworked." (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<h3>Evacuation of Children Begins in England</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden: According to news received here, about 120,000 children in London began to be evacuated yesterday morning, and it seems that it will take five days to complete the evacuation. It is said that about 30 trains a day will transport children from London to places such as Leicester, Somerset, Devon, and Cornwall. According to recent statistics, the total number of children in London is 300,000, and officials are well aware that even after the implementation of the current large-scale evacuation plan, it will still be difficult to evacuate all the children. (Haitong News Agency, 14th)</p>
<p>London: The authorities have stipulated that if paratroopers or other troops parachute from the air, volunteers or local defense volunteers must go to the church to ring the bell to warn the public. In addition, all churches are prohibited from ringing the bells. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<h3>US Ambassador to Britain Meets with British Foreign Secretary to Discuss the Need for Assistance to the Allies</h3>
<p>London: US Ambassador to Britain, Kennedy, met with British Foreign Secretary Halifax yesterday. It is believed that both sides discussed the issue of further American assistance to the Allies. It is generally believed that the German occupation of Paris is only a matter of time, and the situation of France is therefore in danger. Britain's request for military materials from the United States to curb the German threat is even more urgent. It is believed that if the United States can transport military supplies to the Allies as soon as possible, the Allies will not only be able to stop the German advance, but also repel the German army.

<h3>Japan's Treaty of Friendship with Thailand and Britain's Non-Aggression Pact with Thailand are Said to be Completely Different in Nature</h3>
<p>Tokyo: Regarding the official news from Bangkok that Thailand (formerly Siam) has concluded a non-aggression pact with Britain and France, a British interviewer recently asked a spokesperson for the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs whether Japan opposes the British non-aggression pact with Thailand. The spokesperson replied, "No, Japan's treaty of friendship with Thailand has nothing to do with the British and French non-aggression pacts with Thailand and their negotiations. The Japanese-Thai treaty is completely different from the British and French non-aggression pacts with Thailand. The Japanese-Thai treaty aims to maintain and promote the peaceful and friendly relationship that already exists between the two countries, while non-aggression pacts, as initiated by the Soviet Union in 1926, are concluded because one party fears aggression from the other."

<h3>British King's Special Envoy Arrives in US by Plane Carrying Important Documents</h3>
<p>New York: Robinson, the special envoy sent by the British King, arrived here today. He traveled from Europe on the Pan American Clipper, carrying a small box of important documents, chained to his arm, never leaving his side, and could not remove the lead box until he arrived at the British Embassy in Washington and handed over the documents. It is said that the reason for placing the documents in the lead box is that it is heavy, and in case of an accident during the crossing of the ocean, the box will sink to the bottom of the sea and will not drift into the hands of others.

<h3>Turkey Takes Precautions, Actively Strengthens Defense, New German-Turkish Trade Agreement Established</h3>
<p>Ankara: It is believed that Turkey's position, due to the situation created by Italy's participation in the war, will soon be clarified. It is likely that Turkish Prime Minister Saydam will issue a formal statement today. Yesterday, the authorities considered all the disputes involved in any steps Turkey might take. The cabinet held two meetings, and the People's Party seemed to be continuing to hold plenary sessions. The British and French ambassadors resumed talks with the Turkish authorities yesterday, while the Italian and German diplomats stationed here were also very active. At the same time, under recent orders, the reserves who should enlist are now leaving their fields and joining the army. Horses and vehicles have been requisitioned where necessary. This activity does not mean that Turkey will immediately declare war, but it is a sign that the Turkish government attaches great importance to its national defense and obligations. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>Ankara: According to news received here, the trade agreement signed yesterday between Germany and Turkey has been exchanged and approved. According to the agreement, the value of goods exchanged between the two parties each year will reach 21,000,000.</p>
<p>Berlin: Berlin is very pleased with Spain's declaration as a non-belligerent country and Turkey's decision to adopt a neutral policy. Germany believes that Spain's change from neutrality to non-belligerency is a sign of solidarity between Germany, Italy, and Spain, and that Turkey's continued neutrality and the conclusion of the German-Turkish trade treaty are regarded by political figures here as a sign that Turkey is truly following Kemal's legacy. (Haitong News Agency, 18th)</p>
<p>Istanbul: According to the "Tan Newspaper," the mutual assistance treaty between Britain, France, and Turkey stipulates that military assistance will be given to Turkey in the event of an Italian attack on the Eastern Mediterranean, but Italy has no intention of expanding the war to the Eastern Mediterranean. Although future developments are unknowable, it is expected that Italy will limit its military actions as much as possible. (Haitong News Agency, 14th)</p>
<h3>If Undefended Cities in Egypt are Bombed, They Will Immediately Declare War on Italy</h3>
<p>Cairo: Egypt's current policy towards Italy is purely defensive. However, according to sources here, Egypt fully respects the British-Egyptian Treaty, and should therefore be governed by Britain itself, and cooperate with Britain in guaranteeing security, limited to providing naval, land, and air force bases. These bases should of course be regarded as military targets and will be attacked by the Italian side. However, if Italy attacks other territories of Egypt, or bombs purely Egyptian airfields, ports, towns, or civilians and soldiers, Egypt will be forced to declare war. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<h3>Ireland Declares Strict Neutrality</h3>

<h3>Results of the Norwegian Campaign: Hitler Issues Proclamation Praising Meritorious Generals</h3>
<p>Hitler's Headquarters: Hitler today issued a letter to the German army, navy, and air force soldiers who conquered Norway, saying, "Soldiers, the Norwegian war is now over. The attempt by Britain to plunder territory vital to Germany's survival has now been shattered by our soldiers who conquered Norway. Your loyalty and bravery for the country should be inspired by the whole country and the people. General Falkenhorst's command of the land battle, Admiral Saalwachter's, Admiral Carls', and Rear Admiral Lütjens' command of the naval battle, Admiral Boehm's responsibility for coastal defense construction, General Milch's and Lieutenant General Nasse's command of the air battle, their effective operations and victory over the enemy, should be especially commended. The loyalty and bravery of the soldiers of the army, navy, and air force for the country, and their courage to sacrifice, should be especially commended. The Battle of Narvik will be admired by the people of the whole country. Lieutenant General Dietl's battle achievements have added to Germany's glorious history, and I am most inspired by them."

<h3>A "Neutral" Voice at the Beginning of the European War (6)</h3>
<p>— Uncle Di</p>
<p>Prophecy is naturally a very dangerous thing; however, according to the majority opinion of insightful observers at present, even so, it is still impossible. The simplest way to understand is to take a quick glance at the current map of Europe. The annihilation of Poland is probably only a matter of time. At that time, the geographical situation is: Italy and Sweden are allies, and she can also jointly expand her power in the Balkans with the Soviet Union and Germany; conversely, if she separates from Germany and joins the British and French sides, she will be immediately expelled from the Balkans and held by Germany and the Soviet Union. Now, the example of Italy's defection in the last war is constantly appearing in the minds of the British and French rulers, hoping that it can be repeated. However, we must know that Russia stood on the side of the Allied Powers during the last European War. Before the outbreak of the war, the best way for Britain and France to dismantle the German-Italian axis was to ally with the Soviet Union. Now, this has of course become the past. Under the current situation of the Soviet Union's benevolent neutrality towards Germany, it is impossible to separate Italy. In fact, talking about dismantling the German-Italian bloc at this time is really a matter of propaganda with no content. We all know that since the Munich Conference last year, the war preparations of Germany and Italy have long been placed on the same basis, and are being organized and distributed in practice. With the families of two highly industrialized and highly centralized dictators, in fact, they have long become a combat unit, which is absolutely difficult to easily dismantle! If I were to describe it in detail, I am afraid it would take up too much space here; here, I can only cite two of the most obvious examples to give you a glimpse. First, we know that since September 1938, Germany has constantly mobilized more than one million people, and coupled with political indiscriminate arrests and racial anti-Semitism, all kinds of things have created a serious side effect: a shortage of labor. For a country actively preparing for war, this is a very serious panic. So, how to remedy it? An unprecedented thing appeared; Italy supplied a large number of laborers—including workers and farmers—who were transported to Germany by the carload. This is not a simple individual action by workers and farmers, but part of the national policy of Germany and Italy. There is another thing that is also absolutely impossible between countries under other circumstances; that is, Germany massively supplied Italy with junior army officers to reorganize the Italian army. Therefore, it also caused resentment and protests from the Italian army against Mussolini, the seriousness of which can be imagined.</p>
<p>Putting each other's resources in one place and engaging in the organization and preparation for combat on the same basis, in this regard, the German-Italian bloc is earlier than the British-French bloc.</p>
<p>Then, the final question is: Why doesn't Italy join Germany's battle against Britain and France? The answer is still the same as I said before: she has actually participated, but the way is "not to participate." In other words, this is just a part of the overall strategy of the German-Italian bloc. I have mentioned Germany's entire strategy roughly before, so I won't repeat it here. (V) Spain's Opposition to "Expanding the War" (September 19)</p>
<p>In the days before the outbreak of the war, Spain's attitude was a noteworthy and meaningful issue. Its nature is quite subtle; not joining in the celebration? All international conditions and Spain's domestic conditions are denying this. Joining the German-Italian side? If this is the case, then the demobilization work that Franco has been actively carrying out for the past few months will become a bubble, and he will have to mobilize again; but where can he raise this money in the war-torn Spain? Then, take the opportunity to defect and join the British and French sides? This is even more impossible. Just to mention two things, all the fortresses and submarine bases built by Germany and Italy on the northwest and southern coasts of Spain are the shackles that make it difficult for Spain to break away from Germany and Italy; furthermore, the large number of German and Italian military personnel and technicians staying in the southern foothills of the Pyrenees Mountains bordering Spain and France is also a major obstacle to Spain's defection.</p>
<p>Now, the facts have finally answered all our questions. She followed in Italy's footsteps and participated in the battle against Britain and France in the form of "non-participation."</p>
<p>Here, therefore, we get a roughly correct insight: Spain's attitude is more or less dependent on Italy's attitude.</p>
<p>In terms of diplomacy, she has entered a state of suspension with Britain and France during these times. The most active period was the eve of the defeat of the government forces until the beginning of August this year. However, since the failure of the pull-in work under the command of French Foreign Minister Bonnet, and the failure of the friendly work of General Petain, the French ambassador to Spain, who had a teacher-student relationship with Franco, the only one who tried a third experiment was the British industrial delegation. Until the eve of the outbreak of the war, this delegation was still in the process of visiting Spain, and it did not receive any results. Therefore, when Britain and France decided to declare war on Germany before the outbreak of the war, they did not have any illusions about Spain, just like they did about Italy.</p>
<p>In terms of military affairs, what Britain and France are most worried about is the threat of the Spanish coast to Gibraltar, so earlier than any other measures, the first thing the British navy did after mobilization was to declare a blockade of the Strait of Gibraltar. As for the German and Italian submarine bases on the northwest coast of Spain, because Spain is still in a "neutral" position in the law, Britain and France can do nothing about it. The biggest reason for the recent activity of German submarines in the Atlantic is that it has a good base in this area.</p>
<p>Most importantly, of course, is the economic aspect. Since British naval officers announced the blockade of German imports, Germany's trade with South American countries has been completely cut off. Now Germany's remedy is to use the Spanish coast as a transshipment point for trade with South American countries. From here, it is transported to Italy or the Balkan countries. Because Spain and most South American countries are of the same race, Germany can escape the so-called "moral sanctions" of the South American countries under the influence of American propaganda and gain a great advantage in this regard.</p>
<p>Comparing Spain's attitude and position with Italy's, we can immediately discover that her attitude is actually an epitome of Italy's attitude. However, in form, there is also a small difference that is often overlooked by everyone: Italy announced only a temporary non-participation in the battle; Spain, however, clearly announced "neutrality." Because Italy and Germany's alliance was officially announced, in terms of treaty status, if Italy announced "neutrality," it would be equivalent to withdrawing from the alliance. Spain, although in fact it has a military alliance relationship with Germany and Italy, has not announced it, so in terms of treaty status, it can announce its natural "neutrality" when Germany is at war with foreign countries. Of course, these formal differences do not affect the fundamentals of the event. Spain's announcement of "neutrality," like Italy's announcement of "non-participation," can only be understood as a part of Germany and Italy's overall strategy.</p>

<h3>The Significance of the General Graduation Examination System for Schools Above Junior College Lies in Enabling Students to Have a Comprehensive and Systematic Understanding of the Major Subjects They Have Studied</h3>
<p>(Chongqing News Agency) In order to improve the level of students and enhance the effectiveness of teaching, the Ministry of Education has issued a general order to all schools above junior college to implement the general graduation examination system starting from the summer vacation of this year. However, the detailed methods have not yet been announced. Our reporter specially visited the person in charge of the ministry to inquire about the details. It is said that most of the schools above junior college after the Anti-Japanese War have continued to offer classes as usual, except for a very small number that have been suspended due to the war. Moreover, many newly added and reorganized schools have also been established. In the future, in addition to schools that are extremely needed by the country and must be established, there seems to be no need to increase the number of schools. Instead, we should focus all our efforts on improving the quality, such as reorganizing the curriculum, adjusting departments, enriching equipment, focusing on academic research, and improving school examinations. The implementation of the general graduation examination system is only one aspect of the various measures. The Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Committee and the National Senate have also made resolutions on higher education, focusing on substance and strictly enforcing schools and various examinations. The general examination system held by the Ministry of Education this time was proposed very early. The First National Education Conference in the 17th year of the Republic of China made a resolution that "when universities handle graduation in the future, they should hold a general examination of students' courses over the years." The Second National Education Conference in the 19th year of the Republic of China and the Conference of Principals of Schools Above Junior College in the 11th year of the Republic of China had similar resolutions. The Third National Education Conference last year also discussed and passed this case. The examination and evaluation meeting convened by the Examination Yuan a few years ago and the recent personnel administration meeting also had resolutions to prepare for the university graduation joint examination. In order to implement the resolutions of the National Education Conference, the Ministry of Education promulgated a clear order this year to implement the general examination system. In addition to the subjects studied by students in the last semester, a general examination of more than three major specialized subjects in the second and third grades must be conducted. It is a mistake to spread the word that the general examination covers all courses over the years. This system is different from the high school graduation examination. The high school graduation examination requires examinations for all major subjects that have been studied. Those who fail one or two subjects must take a makeup examination and pass before they can graduate. The general examination only needs to select three major specialized subjects that have been studied in the second and third grades for examination. Since these subjects have already been studied, and they are the most needed subjects for students to engage in their careers after graduation, they should be reviewed and studied, and should not be forgotten. Otherwise, how can they be applied after graduation? The purpose of the general examination is to enable students to have a comprehensive and systematic understanding of the major specialized subjects they have studied, which is of great importance to students' research and employment. As for the holding of the general examination, it is still handled separately by each school, and does not adopt a unified joint examination format, so there is no difficulty in implementation. Therefore, the implementation of this system, on the one hand, does not increase the academic burden of students this year, and on the other hand, it actually improves the quality of students in the future. Universities in Europe and the United States attach great importance to various examinations, and especially the European countries are the strictest. British universities also have mid-term examinations, which are similar to the preliminary examinations of our medical schools. Our universities have semester examinations in addition to regular examinations, but no academic year examinations. The implementation of the weaving examination system in the future can also make appropriate compensation for this deficiency. The general graduation examination system is just beginning this year. During the implementation period, the methods should be further studied to obtain the greatest effect.</p>

Each candidate will also be accompanied by a staff member from their school to take care of them. The chief examiner on that day will be Mr. Chen Xuanshan, Deputy Director of the Chinese Education Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Plans to Increase Loan Funds for Students Above Junior College</h3>
<p>(Chongqing News Agency) The Ministry of Education has previously increased the meal fee loan for schools above junior college to 10 to 16 yuan per student per month, taking into account the cost of living in various places. Recently, due to soaring prices and particularly high cost of living in some places, students still have difficulty obtaining the necessary nutrition. The Ministry of Education believes that insufficient nutrition for students has a great impact on their health, and recently sent telegrams to various schools above junior college to report on the recent status of student meals, the minimum amount of meal fees required, and the local value of food, in order to plan a reasonable increase in meal fee loans again, so that students in various places can obtain the necessary conditions for nutrition.</p>

<h3>Hongkou Cross-Country Team's 6th Summer Training to Begin Tomorrow Morning</h3>
<p>In order to make use of the summer vacation period to seek progress in performance, the Hongkou Cross-Country Team has specially organized the 6th Summer Training Class. There are already 51 applicants from all walks of life in industry, commerce, and academia, all of whom are young people with aspirations for long-distance running.

<h3>Strengthening Defenses, No Worries About Security, Concession Status More Consolidated, False Propaganda Attacks Ineffective, Merchant Corps Supplementing Vacancies, Strength Sufficient</h3>
<p>Since Italy implemented its participation in the war, the situation in Shanghai became somewhat tense due to concerns that the opposition between the British, French, and Italian troops stationed here would cause disputes. However, the firm attitude and actions of the stationed troops of various countries in maintaining the status quo of the concessions have become the most powerful stabilizing factor in Shanghai. The International Merchant Corps has recently replenished its members, increasing its strength, so there is no need to worry about security in the future. Therefore, people's hearts are settled, order is peaceful, and everything has returned to normal. However, the puppet regime has even put forward the demand to withdraw troops, advocating the "recovery" of the concessions. However, the diplomatic authorities of various countries stationed in Shanghai neither pay attention to it nor even seem to see it. It is also very obvious that it is not enough to cause damage to the order of the concessions. Now, a compilation of various situations is as follows:</p>
<p>Pointless Attacks, No Need to Pay Attention</p>
<p>The English-language *China Press* stated that since Italy's participation in the war, a certain newspaper published in Shanghai has relapsed to its old ways, like at the beginning of the European war on September 3rd of last year, and has begun to launch fierce propaganda attacks on foreign concessions in China. Its argument is that in order to guarantee the laws and order of the concessions, the powers should return the concessions to the so-called "Nanjing organization," and so on. There is absolutely no official comment here on this kind of speech, because the powers related to China have not recognized it. As for the opinions of the general public, they believe that the status of the concessions has nothing to do with a certain party. A certain authority pointed out, "We cannot stoop to comment and sully our mouths." It is believed that the constant babbling of a certain party's newspaper may not gain support, because Japan has decided not to intervene in the current situation in Europe and interfere with foreign concessions in China.</p>
<p>International Merchant Corps Strengthens Its Strength</p>
<p>The contribution of the Shanghai Municipal Council's International Merchant Corps to the defense of the Public Concession is very great. However, since the outbreak of the European war, most of the foreigners in Shanghai, in order to defend their motherland, have returned to the front line to join the army and serve on the battlefield, which has led to a sharp reduction in volunteer members. Among them, the British troops are particularly affected. The Commander of the Merchant Corps, Hamber, has repeatedly appealed to all parties to supplement the vacancies, and even hopes that employers will provide convenience to employees who join the volunteer corps. The British Consul-General's Office has also issued a notice to encourage British expatriates to participate enthusiastically. The Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Keswick, has made every effort to advocate for the enrichment of the International Merchant Corps, leading by example, and providing various conveniences to all British employees of Jardine Matheson, which he presides over, so that they can join. Recently, more than 20 employees of the company have officially joined and serve in the English Cavalry of the corps. In addition, Norwegian expatriates and Jewish refugees are also very enthusiastic about participating.</p>
<p>Air Force Personnel Returning to England for Service</p>
<p>Major Duke Cross, a member of the British Royal Air Force Association in Shanghai, will soon leave Shanghai and return to Canada to serve in the British army. The association held a banquet for Duke at the HSBC Building on the Bund at noon yesterday. At that time, the flags of various countries were hung in the room, and the Italian flag had been removed in advance, while the old flag of Austria was still inside. During the banquet, Duke gave a speech, saying that he was one of the reservists. This time, going to Canada will definitely be able to serve the British Air Force. There is no doubt about it. He has received many application letters from British expatriates here who are willing to enlist. After he arrives in Canada in the future, he will report this matter to the authorities and try to enable these people who are determined to serve the country to achieve their goals.</p>
<p>French Ambassador Bids Farewell to Enlisted Soldiers</p>
<p>The French Ex-Servicemen Association in Shanghai held a tea party yesterday evening (the 14th) at 6:30 pm at the French Police Headquarters to bid farewell to the French youths who were called up for military service. The French Ambassador to China, Cosme, and Consul-General Olin were invited to participate.</p>
<p>Italian Embassy Completed Relocation</p>
<p>Since Italy declared its participation in the war, the Italian Embassy at No. 118 Route Pere Robert and the Ambassador's residence, in order to avoid accidents, in addition to automatically suspending the hanging of the Italian flag, have also moved all documents and archives to the Italian Consulate on Chengdu Road for several days. All personnel have also moved out automatically. The relocation work was completed yesterday. The reporter went to inspect the place yesterday and saw that the iron gate of the embassy was ajar, and two French and Chinese police officers were stationed at the door. The interior of the embassy was empty and lonely, with few people. Only five or six French and Chinese police officers were walking back and forth, strictly guarding it. The scene was very deserted. The Italian Consulate on Chengdu Road is working as usual, and because the embassy staff has moved in, the number of people entering and leaving has increased, which is busier than before.</p>
<p>Route Amiral Courbet Street Sign Missing</p>
<p>The English-language *China Press* reported that Route Amiral Courbet in the French Concession, which is named after the Italian King Umberto III, the street sign at one end of the road near the corner of Route Pere Robert was suddenly missing this morning (the 14th). According to witnesses, they told the French Concession police that they had seen a foreigner and a Chinese person remove the street sign there between 9 and 10 o'clock last night (the 13th). French officials said that the name of Route Amiral Courbet will not be changed.</p>
<p>Tram Company Italian Resignations</p>
<p>According to foreign sources, two Italian employees of the French-owned Le Tramway Français de Shanghai have voluntarily resigned. In their resignation letters, they stated that they were very satisfied with everything about the company in the past, but because most of the employees in the company were French, they were willing to voluntarily retire to avoid friction in the future. It is also learned that two other Italian employees who have worked in the company for many years will also take the same approach and voluntarily submit their resignations to the company.</p>
<h3>New York Establishes Central Committee to Raise Funds for Chinese Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>The *Continental Daily News* reported that the American Advisory Committee in this city, representing the American Committee for China Relief, is the central organization for distributing American relief funds. In the past year, it has allocated an average of 100,000 yuan per month to engage in relief work in various parts of China. Recently, a committee member of the association told reporters that although the United States is very concerned about the urgent needs of European war refugees, it is expected that the relief funds designated by the United States for use in China will not be reduced. This city has received news that the various church groups of the American Committee for China Relief have recently established a central committee in New York to raise funds for relief work in China and European countries. The committee members are all people who are particularly familiar with the situation in various parts of the world. After receiving appeals from various places, they are responsible for distributing relief funds. It is expected that the central committee will soon allocate a considerable amount of relief funds to China, because the situation in China, which has suffered from natural disasters and wars, is even worse than that in Europe. Relief workers in this city and the American Advisory Committee all believe that the relief funds that the central committee will allocate to China must be more than those allocated by the Church Committee, so relief work can be more effective than before. At the same time, the Shanghai American Advisory Committee continues to allocate funds to various uncommitted relief areas. The association held a meeting on Tuesday and approved the allocation of huge amounts of relief funds to Peiping and other districts. According to reports received by the association, there is a drought in Hebei and Shandong provinces in North China, and there is a risk of famine. For example, reports from Jinan stated that there was no harvest of wheat at all, and farmers could no longer cultivate the land, so there is no hope for the autumn harvest. During the meeting on Tuesday, the association approved other relief funds, including 22,000 yuan for Hangzhou, 25,000 yuan for the welfare program for children in North China, and 5,000 yuan for Huzhou.</p>
<h3>Legal Tender and US Dollar Called Strong, Already the Only Free Currency</h3>
<p>The English-language *Finance &amp; Commerce* published this Thursday stated that the currencies of all countries in the world are now subject to artificial control. Only the US dollar and legal tender are still free currencies and are not subject to control. Since Italy announced its participation in the war, speculation has been greatly reduced. Those who hold foreign exchange positions are rushing to get out, and those who tend to be bullish can be said to have completely disappeared. Recently, due to the world situation, the foreign exchange market has been volatile and the risk of speculation is very high. Speculators who sold British exchange and bought US exchange in the middle of last week have all lost money.</p>
<h3>British, Italian, and German Expatriate Merchants in Shanghai Mutually Prohibit Commercial Dealings, British Chamber of Commerce Lists German Company Names, Italian Merchants Have Begun to Wind Down Business</h3>
<p>Since Italy participated in the war, the British Embassy in Shanghai issued a notice warning expatriate merchants not to trade with the enemy, and listed nine Italian commercial institutions in Shanghai, urging expatriate merchants to pay special attention to them. It is now learned that the United Kingdom had already taken this measure against Germany. No less than 200 German commercial institutions are listed as requiring special attention, and more than 80 of these institutions are located in Shanghai. Now, according to what was published by the British Chamber of Commerce on June 8, excerpts are listed as follows: China Electric Company Limited, 267 Jiangxi Road; Eklifa Yangxing, 261 Sichuan Road; Bayer Pharmaceutical Unlimited Company, 138 Jiangxi Road; Tianxiang Yangxing, 356 Beijing Road; Baidaoerfu Pharmaceutical Company, 346 Sichuan Road; Bairu Yangxing, 2 Beijing Road; Lihe Yangxing, 670 Sichuan Road; Qianxin Machinery Co., Ltd., 138 Jiangxi Road; Qianxin Yangxing, 236-138 Jiangxi Road; Kedinghe Hardware Company, 2 Beijing Road; Defu Yangxing, 261 Sichuan Road; Taimike Factory, 451 Jiangxi Road; Dehua Bank, 85 Jiujiang Road; German Gold and Silver Chemical Products Company, 133 Yuanmingyuan Road; Ailishi Yangxing, 261 Sichuan Road; German News Agency, 75 Guangdong Road; Yitai Company, 20 Guangdong Road; Fuluo Yangxing, 30 Fuzhou Road; German Railway Travel Agency, 97 Renji Road; Yali Yangxing, 410 Sichuan Road; Xiwang Company, 110 Sichuan Road; Yixin Yangxing, 133 Yuanmingyuan Road; Hengbao Shipping Company, 20 Guangdong Road; Jialinbao Hardware Machinery Factory, 133 Yuanmingyuan Road; Gaole Yangxing, 133 Yuanmingyuan Road; Kelaoxi Machinery United Company, 227 Hamilton House; Kongshi Yangxing, 110 Sichuan Road; and so on.</p>
<p>Italian Merchants Winding Down</p>
<p>Since the Italian merchants and foreign firms in Shanghai received the notice from the Italian Consul-General to stop business with British and French foreign firms, they began to wind down their business with foreign firms. Because the number of Italian merchants in Shanghai is not large, and the scope of business is not as extensive as that of other foreign firms, such as Kaili Yangxing, in the usual scope of business, in addition to various supplies to the Shanghai garrison, foreign trade is very small. Now it specializes in contracting military supplies, so after receiving the order, it mostly announced the clearing within two days.</p>
<h3>Japanese Aircraft Attack Chongqing, Indiscriminate Bombing of Civilians</h3>
<p>Yesterday's *North-China Daily News* published a letter from Chongqing stating that when Japanese aircraft attacked Chongqing on May 28, they committed the most cruel massacre. At that time, countless civilians gathered at the entrance of an air-raid shelter in the Southern District, and before they could enter the shelter, Japanese aircraft saw them and threw bombs at them continuously, killing about 100 civilians. The letter stated, "I believe the Japanese military spokesman in Shanghai will again call this a military target." In this attack on Chongqing, Japanese aircraft also paid special attention to the factory area. A factory in the suburbs was hit by as many as 60 bombs. However, the Japanese even claimed that Japanese aircraft had destroyed China's emerging industry and Chinese airfield.</p>
<h3>Shanghai American Chamber of Commerce Advocates Expanding Shipping, New Ships Will Sail to the Far East, Related to Shanghai's Prosperity</h3>
<p>The American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai believes that there are too few ships in the Far East and advocates increasing shipping to the Far East. It is heard that in the near future, the United States will have new ships joining the Far East shipping. The number of Japanese ships in China is only half of what it was before August 13. Since the European war, the Far East shipping has become more and more depressed, so the increase in American ships is of great importance to the market. All parties are paying attention to it.</p>
<h3>Gas Price to Increase Tomorrow, Surcharge Increased to 158%, Approved by the Shanghai Municipal Council's Public Utilities Committee</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Gas Company recently submitted a budget for this year to the Shanghai Municipal Council, requesting permission to increase the gas surcharge from 80% to 158% due to the soaring prices of various goods and the sharp increase in the company's operating expenses, especially fuel. According to the company, the cost of fuel alone last year was only 2,356,388 yuan, while this year's estimate is about 6,617,000 yuan. In addition, employee salaries, subsidies, and various material resources have all increased due to soaring prices. As for the amount of gas sold, although it has increased compared to last year, the cost of the increased portion is significant due to coal prices. Based on the above, an increase in price is necessary to make up for the shortfall. The Public Utilities Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Council held two meetings on the 7th and 11th of this month to discuss the matter, and invited company representatives to attend and explain in order to show prudence. As a result, the committee members all believed that the company's statement was in line with the actual situation and should be approved, and will be implemented from the time when the gas use period ends on or after July 16. However, the Bureau may reconsider it within three months. The above proposal has been approved by the Board of Directors of the Bureau at its regular meeting on the 12th of this month.</p>
<h3>Attacking Yichang, Bombing Chongqing, Japanese Army Accomplishes Nothing, Peace Rumors Denied by the Chinese Side, Terrorist Policies Prolong the War</h3>
<p>According to Mr. Han Ellis of the American *China Economic Review* in Shanghai, in recent weeks, rumors of peace between China and Japan have not been prevalent in the Shanghai stock market. Some people even believe that the Japanese army's fierce attack on Yichang and the bombing of Chongqing are enough to promote peace negotiations between China and Japan. However, in his opinion, the Japanese army's fierce attack on Yichang is just enough to prove the endlessness of the Sino-Japanese war. The National Government's firm denial of peace and its expression of its determination to continue the war are all powerful evidence. The cargo transportation between the Yangtze River and Shanghai will be cut off due to the war in Yichang. The goods transported from Shanghai to various parts of Western Sichuan through the war zone may not be sold smoothly, especially textiles. However, on the contrary, Japan's industry has not improved recently. Japan's largest mine has announced its suspension due to the bank's refusal to grant loans. The Japanese military actions in China have caused serious losses to various industries in Japan.</p>
<h3>Unified 9th Principal and Interest, Four Banks Pay</h3>
<p>The ninth repayment of principal and interest on the five types of bonds of the 25th Year of the Republic Unified Public Bonds A, B, C, D, and E, after the Ministry of Finance, which was secured by customs duties, was forced to stop paying principal and interest, the bondholders were very concerned about the principal and interest payable this time. A *New Voice* reporter learned from banking circles yesterday that it was confirmed that the National Debt Fund Management Committee had consulted with the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank to jointly discount and pay. Now the Shanghai branches of the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications have received orders from the head office to start paying from July 31. All bondholders can fill out the discount payment application form and, after the three banks have verified it, they will issue a "discount voucher" and pay it off in six installments, one installment per month, and clear it by the end of December, and pay it according to the Shanghai applicable remittance rate. Now the discount vouchers and application forms have been printed and will be paid on schedule.</p>
<h3>Important News Summary</h3>
<p>Interest Holiday: The Banking Industry Friendship Association suggested that the Banking Association follow the example of banks in Tianjin, Chongqing, and Wuhan and take a one-day holiday after each interest payment. All matters will be handled on the next day. This issue is not within the purview of this bank. It is proposed that it be implemented after the end of this year and next year.</p>
<p>Investment Inland: More than 5,000 doctors in this city, in view of the recent repeated bombings of civilian areas in Chongqing by Japanese aircraft, in order to rescue injured compatriots, jointly submitted a request to the medical authorities to voluntarily abandon their careers and go to the inland to participate in anti-war relief work. This group includes more than 20 doctors, more than 20 nurses, and 30 young students from various universities who went to the inland to participate in war zone work.</p>
<p>Recruiting Crew Members: The Chinese branch of the International Labor Bureau learned that more than 20,000 Chinese workers who worked on German and Italian ships have returned to their countries after being unemployed. In order to maintain commercial transportation, British and French commercial ships have implemented a joint transportation escort method and need a large number of employees. More than 200 unemployed crew members have been recruited in Hong Kong and Shanghai and distributed to British and French ships. Safety issues are adequately guaranteed and the salaries are relatively high.</p>
<p>Crew Member Detained: More than 140 stewards of the New Hongxing Wheel of the Daxing Shipping Company have been unemployed for three years. Now, because the company's Hengxing Wheel (renamed Shantaishan and taken over by Portuguese merchants) has resumed sailing and there are several vacancies, representatives were sent to meet with Chinese manager Xu Zhongxin to ask for placement, but they were reported to the steward's office and workers Cao Houxiong and Ren Linfu were detained and not released until late.</p>

<h3>Last Year's French Concession, Public Health Improved, Efforts Made to Rectify Various Facilities, Number of Jewish Doctors Increased</h3>
<p>According to the French Municipal Council's Department of Health's annual report, the health situation improved greatly last year. The previous situation was extremely chaotic. The high mortality rate last year was the same as in 1938. It is particularly noteworthy that 72 out of every 100 registered deaths were children.</p>
<p>Smallpox Eradication Very Effective</p>
<p>The report investigates the main types of diseases and points out that in the first week of January 1940, smallpox was prevalent, with 69 cases, which then decreased and completely disappeared in May. The percentage of foreign deaths was 31.81, while the number of Chinese deaths was 37.72. The smallpox epidemic in the winter of 1938 proved the necessity of prevention. The number of people vaccinated exceeded 540,091. Vaccination of newborn babies was also strictly enforced.</p>
<p>Typhoid Prevention Good</p>
<p>The prevention of typhoid and paratyphoid fever in Shanghai is also very good. Last year's typhoid fever gradually declined from the fierce momentum that began the year before. After August, the number was lower than in the same month of the previous year. There were only 1,218 cases of typhoid fever and 508 deaths. The origin of this infectious disease does not come from tap water, because the drinking water supplied by the French Tap Water Company is of very good quality, and some well water is also managed.</p>
<p>Cholera Patients Mostly Not Injected</p>
<p>The first occurrence of cholera was in June last year. Later, there were a total of 77 cases recorded, with 13 deaths. Statistics show that 77.92% of those infected had not been vaccinated. The effectiveness of vaccination can be further proved by the soldiers in each camp. Due to the mandatory vaccination of soldiers, none of them developed the disease.</p>
<p>Disinfection Work Also Very Active</p>
<p>The reorganization of disinfection services this year also attempts to improve the health situation and hopes to achieve active disinfection services through education and cooperation with social figures. In its investigation, investigators issued announcements in four languages: French, English, Russian, and Chinese. The Chinese are also gradually understanding the need for patients to wear disinfected clothing.</p>
<p>Testing Milk, Filling Earth Wells</p>
<p>In the next year, the French Concession may not have any cases of rabies. Although 228 Chinese and foreigners went to treat rabies this year, the French Concession's milk disinfection began in 1939. The testing of unclean milk continues. Some new wells have been dug, and the deep wells have reached 55. Some Chinese wells have been proven to be unclean, and the South Mouth Chamber has been completely filled.</p>
<p>Factory Hygiene Gradually Improving</p>
<p>As of the end of last year, there were 1,600 licensed factories. The facilities in smaller factories are extremely poor, and most of them need to improve ventilation and lighting. Vaccination for smallpox and injection for cholera and typhoid fever must be followed by workers in these factories.</p>
<p>Clearing Garbage, Cremating Corpses</p>
<p>Garbage removal in the French Concession has encountered difficulties, but by the end of the year, it was no longer a problem. Charitable organizations have been entrusted with burial work, burying 2,315 unclaimed adults and cremating 13,671 children's corpses. Because the movement on the Huangpu River is restricted, the authorities have had to implement cremation work for unclaimed corpses throughout the year. Therefore, a total of 17,669 corpses were cremated.</p>
<p>More Than Two Thousand Chinese and Foreign Doctors</p>
<p>The number of foreign doctors registered last year was extremely high, due to the arrival of Jewish refugees in Shanghai. The number of Chinese doctors has decreased slightly. At the end of last year, there were a total of 2,256 doctors, both Chinese and foreign, registered with the French Municipal Council.</p>

<h3>Indigo Cloth Transported to the Mainland, Detained in Vietnam, Local Government Suspects German Goods, Manufacturers Ask the French Consulate in Shanghai for Proof</h3>
<p>Since the Anti-Japanese War, the transportation of various goods to the rear has mostly been transshipped through Vietnam and transported to the mainland via the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway. Because of the needs of the people in the mainland, freight transportation is very busy, especially for cloth. The reason is that the people in various occupied areas of the country have moved to the mainland, resulting in a population increase of several times more than in the past. Clothing is a non-expendable item, so it is even more popular. Recently, because Italy implemented its participation in the war, the three countries of Britain, France, and Italy each notified their national commercial firms to mutually prohibit the transaction of all goods from enemy countries, so the cloth transported from Shanghai to various parts of the mainland and transshipped through Vietnam will be detained if there is a suspicion of German trademarks. It is heard that the recently exported "indigo" has been detained in Vietnam because "indigo" is a German registered trademark. It is found that in addition to the trademark being registered by Germany, the raw materials for dyeing, weaving, and spinning on the cloth are all domestic products. The manufacturers in Shanghai were shocked after hearing about it, and have sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to ask the French Consulate in Shanghai to provide proof in order to facilitate commercial transportation and maintain the inherent good relations between China and France.</p>

<h3>The Incident on Haig Road the Night Before: Both Sides Resolve Peacefully, Arising from a False Policeman's Traffic Violation, Chinese and Vietnamese Constables Detained and Then Released</h3>
<p>The French Police Department dispatched Chinese and Vietnamese constables, along with female clerks, to inspect pedestrians in front of Jiaotong University on Haig Road in Xujiahui at approximately 5 PM on the 12th. A person posing as a policeman drove by in a car, violating traffic regulations and being rebuked by the patrol. The fake policeman refused to yield and retorted before leaving. He then entered Jiaotong University to report to the Japanese military police stationed there, who then rushed out in force and dragged the French police's Chinese and Vietnamese constables into the "Police Station" beside the Jiaotong University headquarters. Upon receiving the report, the French Police Department dispatched personnel to negotiate. It is now learned that the French Police Department sent personnel to negotiate with officials from the Japanese Military Police Headquarters in West Shanghai. As a result, the detained Chinese and Vietnamese constables were released at 8:30 PM that night and regained their freedom.</p>
<p>According to the North China Daily News:</p>
<p>At approximately 5:30 PM on the 12th of this month, a "Municipal Police" officer drove a car near Jiaotong University on Haig Road in the French Concession. The car did not display a permit, violating traffic regulations. A Chinese constable from the French Police Department stopped him and asked the "Municipal Police" officer to accompany him to the nearby police station. Unexpectedly, the "Municipal Police" officer refused, saying the matter could be resolved at the nearest "Municipal Police Station."</p>
<p>Confrontation Ensues</p>
<p>Several other "Municipal Police" officers and a Vietnamese constable from the French Concession arrived. To avoid causing trouble, the Chinese and Vietnamese constables accompanied the "Municipal Police" officer who violated traffic regulations to the nearest "police station," but were then detained. Senior officers from the French Police Department, officers from the Japanese Military Police, and "Municipal Government" personnel rushed to the "police station" to mediate. At 8:30 PM, the detained Chinese and Vietnamese constables were released. While mediation was underway inside the "police station,"</p>
<p>During Mediation</p>
<p>a car belonging to a high-ranking Chinese "official" suddenly became involved in a dispute with a pedestrian outside the "police station." Onlookers gathered, and the "Municipal Police," fearing a riot, rushed out of the "police station" and fired two shots into the air, dispersing the crowd. Yesterday morning (the 13th), a certain Japanese newspaper published this news, claiming that the "Municipal Police" and the French Concession patrol exchanged gunfire. However, French sources have emphatically denied this, refuting the claim that the French Concession patrol used firearms. Reportedly, the matter between the French Concession patrol and the "police station"</p>
<p>Involved No Gunfire</p>
<p>Furthermore, the English-language Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury reported that both the French Concession authorities and the "Municipal Government" announced this morning (the 14th) that the incident involving police officers from both sides on Haig Road on the evening of the 12th had been "amicably resolved." According to a French Concession police officer, the matter stemmed from a misunderstanding, and a "Municipal Police" officer fired two shots into the air to disperse a large crowd of onlookers.</p>
<h3>Sweet Rain after a Long Drought: Light Rain Fell Yesterday, but the Amount Was Minimal</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of summer, the amount of rainfall in this city and surrounding areas has been scarce, especially in the past month. The land is parched, and farmers are anxious. According to a reporter from the Pingming News Agency who consulted the Xujiahui Observatory yesterday, the record of rainfall in this city since May 17th until yesterday is unprecedentedly low, totaling only 2.4 centimeters. In the same period last year, it reached 49.7 centimeters. However, the</p>
<p>Total Rainfall</p>
<p>from January 1st to yesterday is not less than last year. The total amount of rainfall from the beginning of the year to June 14th last year was 352.8 centimeters, while this year's total from the beginning of the year to yesterday is 374.3 centimeters. Therefore, the total rainfall this year is actually more than in previous years, but since May 17th, it has been unprecedentedly scarce. The rainfall from 5 AM to 3 PM yesterday was 3.5 centimeters. Due to the scarcity of past rainfall, river water has become shallow, and</p>
<p>Rice Paddies are Cracked</p>
<p>Counties around this city such as Songjiang, Qingpu, Kunshan, Taicang, and Jiading are rice-producing areas. The soil is dry and cracked, causing difficulties in transplanting seedlings, leading to early signs of drought. Villagers irrigate the land day and night, but the water dries up quickly. In higher areas, even the river water is gradually drying up. Therefore, farmers in the surrounding areas are very concerned about the drought. The western suburbs of this city, including Meilong, Xinzhuang, Qidou, and Pudong, are</p>
<p>Early Rice Regions</p>
<p>and are especially eager for rain. Some speculative rice merchants, knowing that Shanghai's rice reserves are still substantial, are using this as an excuse to raise rice prices. Vegetable prices have also been rising for days. At the same time, the dry climate has led to a prevalence of throat ailments, which is harmful to people's health. Therefore, people in this city and the surrounding areas have been eagerly hoping for sweet rain. Until 5 AM yesterday, dark clouds covered the sky and light rain fell intermittently until the evening. This is of great benefit to agriculture and is also beneficial to people's health.</p>
<h3>Law School Student Feng Ruiwei Sentenced to Four Months for Fraud, Xi Shaofen Acquitted</h3>
<p>Chen Zongtao, a young man from Guangdong, and Feng Ruizhang, from Wujin, are both students at the Shanghai Law School. In December last year, Feng borrowed a check for 37,300 yuan from Chen and exchanged it for cash with Xi Shaofen, a female clerk at the former Lianglu Bureau, promising to cash it on a specific date.

Chen, feeling unjustly implicated, hired lawyers Xu Wufang and Lu Ronggan to represent him. They submitted a petition to the Criminal Court of the Special No. 2 Court, accusing Feng Ruizhang and Xi Shaofen of jointly committing fraud and deceiving him out of a large check. Judge Li 　shan tried the case. The defendant Feng hired lawyer Fang Junjie for defense, and Xi hired Jiang Yiping, Ge Bangren, and Shao Jingkang as lawyers for defense.

<p>The corner house at No. 96 Rue Lupan and No. 2 Avenue Paul Beau in the French Concession was leased from the China Business Company by Gao Fengxi from Shandong, who opened the Defeng Western Restaurant there with a monthly rent of 146 yuan. Due to poor business, the restaurant closed in April this year. Gao then</p>
<p>Sublet the Entire House</p>
<p>to more than ten households, earning 400-500 yuan in rent each month, making a significant profit. Recently, Gao, because the house contract was about to expire at the end of this year, sublet the house to Ding Hongxiang, the owner of the Hongguang Company at No. 103 Rue du Consulat, for a large sum of money, and notified all tenants to contact Ding regarding housing matters in the future. At the same time, Ding stopped collecting rent from the first of this month and notified each tenant to</p>
<p>Vacate by a Deadline</p>
<p>When this had no effect, he issued a second notice a few days ago, setting a three-day deadline to vacate, threatening to cut off water and electricity. The tenants were planning a response when, unexpectedly, at around 9 AM yesterday, a dozen workers arrived at the house to intimidate the tenants. One of them broke into the room of Mr. Leet, a British customs official at No. 2, whose Chinese wife, Jin Ming, and her sister, Jin Yao, were</p>

Ma Benlong appealed, and after several summons, the court ruled to dismiss Ma Benlong's appeal, and all the imitated machines used by the Tiangong Needle Factory were confiscated.</p>
<h3>Lawsuit Involving Aunt and Daughter-in-law over the Sale of Hua Yi Tailor Shop</h3>
<p>Zheng Zhuangshi, a 63-year-old woman from Fenghua, had a second son, Zheng Renhe, who opened the Hua Yi Tailor Shop on Avenue Joffre in this city.

The court ruled that the defendant should hand over the children and property to the original guardian, Zheng Zhuangshi. Recently, Zheng Zhuangshi, claiming that her daughter-in-law Fang had sold the Hua Wu Tailor Shop, which had a capital of tens of thousands of yuan, to her confidant Zhu Zhicheng for a low price of 3,750 yuan during the litigation period, which was clearly a conspiracy to harm her grandchildren's property, hired lawyer He Xiaoyuan in her capacity as legal representative to file another lawsuit in the Civil Court of the Special No. 2 Court against Zheng Fang and Zhu Zhicheng, seeking to confirm the invalidity of the sales contract. Judge Li Liang opened the trial yesterday and summoned both parties, who arrived with their lawyers. After arguments, the court declared that the case was clear and set a date for judgment.</p>

<p>While rumors were still rampant in Shanghai, there was a subtle undercurrent of stability. Market sentiment has been tempered over time and is no longer easily stimulated by ordinary news. Yesterday, most buyers and sellers still settled transactions on a next-day basis, with scalping activity also quite lively. However, Tongji's selling of Class A shares attracted some attention. Lianyi and Lianhe also showed more selling than buying, while Jiufeng exchanged Class E and Class A shares for domestic varieties. The market prices showed some slight differences, and the final result was that, compared to the previous day, Class A shares fell by a slight five points, while Class D shares did not open at all throughout the day, and the remaining shares rose slightly by one or two jiao or so. The total transaction volume was approximately 800,000 to 900,000 yuan. A simplified table is provided below.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the sharp rise of [day] was almost ten [unclear characters]), and a drop of more than one yuan could only be seen as a normal reaction. Shanghai stock market operators did not pay attention to this, and trading was very quiet. Brokers, on this occasion, if there are no major international events, can explain this kind of increasingly narrow turnover, and how will the hidden worries about the future be? Most of the floaters in the market had cleared their positions in advance, so the "cutting long" scene was not seen yesterday. British Union shares and Jardine Matheson shares accounted for 40% of the total transaction volume throughout the day. The opening prices of various stocks were almost the same as the previous day and the initial morning prices. Rubber stocks were the same.</p>
<p>London, 13th (Thursday) Dispatch: Today's listed prices of British Far East companies' stocks saw mixed gains and losses. Mercantile Bank shares fell half a pound to seven and a half pounds. Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation shares rose two shillings and six pence to a price of twelve pounds, seven shillings, and six pence. The rest remained flat.</p>
<p>London, 13th (Thursday dispatch): Today's listed prices of Chinese foreign debt remained flat. There were no changes in the prices of various bonds.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn: Guangdong Merchants Purchasing Coarse Yarn, Shuangma Halted Before Falling</h3>
<p>The yarn market is stable, and the downward trend has been curbed, thanks to the stable foreign exchange rate and the calming of sentiment. At the same time, sales in the South China region are particularly strong for 10-count coarse yarn, which helps to maintain the situation. However, general speculators buy low and sell high, so market transactions remain lively.</p>
<p>In the morning opening of spot yarn, it was heard that the US exchange rate was shrinking, and sentiment was good, with strong buying interest. 20-count Shuangma [unclear character] was 1,140 yuan. As soon as this price opened, sellers rushed to sell, and there were looser chips in the market. The market fell straight to 1,090 yuan. Soon, due to the eager purchase of coarse yarn by [unclear character] Guangdong merchants and the shrinking of foreign exchange, [unclear character] accounts became active, [unclear character] rose again to 1,114 yuan to close the session. According to the statistics of transactions in half a day, 1,280 bales were traded. The price of 20-count Shuangma fell by 13 yuan. Today, 300 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Tianjin, 115 pieces were shipped to Yantai, and 609 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong. The amount purchased by each gang is listed below:</p>
<h3>Local Cotton Mills Need to Shut Down</h3>
<p>The quietness of local cotton transactions is as rare as phoenix feathers. The factory's needs are dull due to the ordinary yarn market. In addition, the recent arrival of Indian and American cotton has been continuous, so sentiment is sluggish, and the market remains quiet. Only 100 pieces of Indian cotton, Sikedeng cotton, were traded among peers, with a price of 110 yuan for delivery at the pier.</p>
<p>Another report: The price of foreign cotton in New York, in the early morning yesterday, first rose by more than 20 pounds due to the news of Liverpool's opening [unclear character] and rising prices. Then, due to the weakness of stock prices on Wall Street, the market returned to weakness. As a result, closing prices rose by three to five pounds for the near-term contracts compared to the previous day, and fell by two or three pounds for the far-term contracts. The Liverpool cotton market has been closed since May 17th, and it has been almost a month now. Yesterday, the opening price rose by more than 30 to more than 70 pounds.</p>
<p>Shanghai's foreign cotton trade, the current price has been [unclear character] in a stable state, trade is also gradually [unclear character] dawn, but the number is not large. Due to the tension of the European war, the transport of cotton has become more difficult. At the same time, the steady rise of American cotton, so the industry thinks [unclear character] pro-American tendency.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Small Retailers Seeking to Sell, Cloth Prices Continue to Fall; Down by One-Third From Peak</h3>
<p>Domestic cloth market continued to be weak yesterday, and small retailers were eager to sell, uniformly cutting prices. However, cloth [unclear character] has fallen by one-third from its peak, and the number of factories suspending work is increasing daily. As foreign cotton [unclear character] rises and yarn prices stabilize, large retailers seem calmer, so the downward trend has eased. Yesterday, loose white goods fell by 2.5 jiao, bleached and dyed cloth fell by 3.5 jiao. Large lots remained flat. The street traded several thousand pieces of bleached light-colored summer cloth and blue cloth, more than 200 [unclear character] of coarse cloth blanks, more than 100 pieces of Zhejiang and Anhui merchant-handled coarse cloth, colored cloth, and foreign yarn, and nearly 100 boxes of Guangdong and Yunnan merchant-handled Shilin cloth and colored twill.</p>
<p>East cloth first rose and then weakened. Longtou fine cloth opened at 35.8 yuan in the morning. Then, due to the release of funds by peers, it went downstream step by step. The closing price at noon was 35.2 yuan. The market sentiment continued to be weak, and the number of traders was sparse, falling to 35 yuan. The price of Four Gentlemen's Serge fell to 8.9 jiao.</p>
<p>Exports: Today, 238 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong, another 120 pieces were shipped to Tianjin, and another 385 pieces were shipped to Yantai.</p>
<h3>Grain: Rice Prices Ease Slightly, Recover in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>After the rice market tightened the day before yesterday, the market opened yesterday morning, and suddenly, due to the cold and rainy weather, sentiment turned soft. Sales were stagnant, and with nearly 200,000 bags of newly traded foreign rice, sentiment could not help but turn flat. Therefore, the price of foreign rice once fell by half a yuan. If Huojiao only sold for 54.5 yuan, Xiaowen for 52.5 yuan, gradually driven by general sales from inland rural customers, the market turned [unclear character]. Extending to the mid-market, the news of the good return of Lanjin prices boosted sentiment, especially the most party activites, such as speculators rose up to absorb, the situation turned tight, [unclear character] time to restore the original disk, the afternoon buying more prosperous, the return cargo also called high, the current rice immediately step by step on the morning, Xiaojiao rice bank line morning 53.23 yuan, afternoon to 54 yuan, Pudong line morning 52.7 jiao, afternoon to 53.5 yuan, the result was a rise of five to seven jiao compared to the previous evening.</p>
<p>The arrival of glutinous rice is scarce, and the stock is not weak, but sales are meager, making it difficult to compete with other goods. Supply and demand are similar, and the market is not much up or down. Sales are open to all, and all abide by the previous [unclear character] disk.</p>
<p>Due to the relationship between Kang and Bi, the price of coarse rice in the mainland is [unclear character] expensive, attracting firm sentiment, resulting in continuous soaring prices in the black market outside the market, creating an unprecedented peak. Yesterday, although there was timely rain, it was rumored that it was still difficult to curb its sharpness in the black market. General cargo owners still held on, considering that their own capital and later goods were limited, and they were unwilling to sell easily, [unclear character] in support. Fortunately, on the customer side, except for those who needed to buy out of necessity, others were more relaxed than before. As a result, the selling price was still stable. Changbang's special Qingjing rice was still 64 yuan, Nanhang's early rice was 60 yuan, only Qingsi's high and thin rice opened at 62.5 yuan, a slight increase of half a yuan.</p>

<h3>Flour Market Customer Disk Secretly Tight, Wheat Source Not Cleared</h3>
<p>The flour market was quite firm yesterday. In terms of sales, in addition to retail transactions on this street, customer orders continued to be inquired by the Nanyang Gang, and the Beiyang Gang also intended to add to their purchases. Each factory, since the new wheat in various places has been on the market for a long time, but the transportation problem to Shanghai has not been resolved so far, on the one hand, has sent a letter to the authorities to take action, on the other hand, is still in consultation, because the two batches of Jiading wheat and Wuhu wheat that arrived in the previous two days were not formal arrivals, so there are concerns about the future of raw materials. It is heard that the No. 2 Flour Factory's disk is maintaining its nature, still at 12.8 yuan, while the customer disk has reached 16.25 yuan, and yesterday it shouted up another one jiao.

It is estimated that yesterday's transaction volume was only [unclear character] hundred.</p>

<h3>The Hardships of Missionaries (II)</h3>
<p>After the Western missionary A. Qiba encountered difficulties in spreading the gospel in Changsha, he continued in his letter to a friend, saying: "When people on the shore saw my boat, they shouted and threw bricks, stones, mud, and sand, like rain. Fortunately, a gunboat rushed over and took me into its boat. Another gunboat pulled my boat away. I was covered in mud, but there was no great harm. But several people who saved me on the gunboat were seriously injured. Later, two county magistrates came to the gunboat to watch, but they did not suppress the situation. They only said that they would never allow the people to kill me. Then the gunboat docked on the other side, and the official said to me again that the people of Hunan were inherently strong. I did not answer him, but secretly thought that the local officials in Changsha had first blocked me for several days, waited until the villagers had gathered, and then invited me to the dock, so that I could fully taste the bricks and stones. I have never heard a word of suppression. I don't know if there is such a clause in the peace treaty. So I asked the official to arrest several people for investigation, but the official replied that he could not. At that time, the crowd was surging, and they had already pulled the boat across the river, shouting to kill the devil. The boatman in my boat had already fled. It was really impossible to tolerate. So I went back to the boat to take a few things for use and went to the gunboat, and sailed to a bay in the middle of the river in Changsha. After careful consideration, it is better to run away. I heard that the scholars in Xiangtan also had plans to harm me. There were thorns everywhere. How could I be accommodated! It has been the fourth time that the people of Changsha Prefecture have had trouble with the people in the church."</p>

<h3>The Rise of National Women</h3>
<p>— Jin Gang</p>
<p>The flames of the European War caused unprecedented turmoil in the peaceful and leisurely old England for more than ten years. In the atmosphere of general mobilization, batches of warriors marched to the front, and majestic military songs floated in every street. The grand evening party will no longer play intoxicating music, and gentlemen have abandoned their long and beautiful lives. Some are serving in the army, and some are participating in various wartime jobs, but countless women with comfortable occupations are losing their jobs in batches. Women with families have tearfully bid farewell to their beloved husbands, and even their own children have to be evacuated to the countryside. Even the Queen's daughter is no exception. Indeed, war is cruel, changing the content of everyone's life.</p>
<p>Naturally, in this war of national survival, every British citizen has his or her own responsibility. Women, like men, undertake many wartime service jobs in the rear. Now British women have several very important organizations. One is the "Women's Land Army," with more than 10,000 members. The captain is Lady Halldane, and the members are distributed in various army garrisons, cooking for the soldiers, washing clothes, and general comfort work. One is the "Women's Royal Naval Service," with 4,000 members. The captain is Lady Laurton Maud, and the members are distributed on various warships, responsible for washing, sweeping, cooking, and many miscellaneous tasks. One is the "Women's Auxiliary Air Force," with more than 12,000 members. The members are assigned to airfields to assist pilots in many tasks, as well as engineering duties. The women in each team serve the country as faithfully and bravely as men. In addition, the "Women's Voluntary Service" is the largest rear women's service organization, including women from all walks of life, with 500,000 members and branches all over the country. The "First Aid Nursing Yeomanry" and the "British Red Cross Society" are the women's organizations responsible for front and rear rescue work, which are full of thousands of strong, active, and brave British women!</p>
<p>Some of these women's team members are volunteers and also donate funds to the organization. Some are subsidized by the state. Many are women from aristocratic and wealthy families, who are usually surrounded by servants. But now they have become the servants of the soldiers. They endure endless hardships and consider it to be the supreme glory!</p>
<p>The commander-in-chief of these women's service teams is the Queen of England. She is responsible for the highest command. She extracts the most precious time day and night to work for the development and enrichment of these women's organizations. Naturally, the British resistance to Germany benefits greatly from these strong women's organizations!</p>

<h3>Striving for Work Efficiency</h3>
<p>— Wang Tao</p>
<p>Many people only know how to work, but they don't pay attention to efficiency. If he works ten points and receives seven points of efficiency, that is a significant loss to him. However, this loss still exists universally, whether in you, in me... and in the vast strata.</p>
<p>Although we do not hope to immediately achieve the point of "doing half the work and getting twice the results," we should at least not lose money, not suffer losses, do ten points of work, and receive ten points of efficiency. Of course, we hope to receive twelve points or even fifteen points of efficiency, and strive for greater victory in our work.</p>
<p>At first glance, this seems to be a very boring and tedious thing, but the benefits it gives us are endless. Moreover, we are in a very turbulent era. The heavy responsibilities entrusted to us by the nation, the country, and society should be diligently completed. This endless work not only needs us to complete, but we must also strive for the greatest efficiency.</p>
<p>We can often see that a clerk in a cigarette paper shop works more than twelve hours a day, but he spends most of his time idly watching the scenery on the road and chatting idly. This is not only a waste of time, causing the work efficiency to be small, but also develops a terrible laziness towards work. This laziness not only exists in the clerk of the cigarette paper shop, but it exists in the office workers who put up their feet and chat idly in the office, the civil servants in the government agencies, the teachers and staff in the schools, the students... and everything else.</p>
<p>Regardless of industry, agriculture, military, education, or commerce, work and efficiency are inseparable. And this question needs us to reflect deeply, consider, and [unclear character]. We can see that in the factories of capitalist countries, the capitalists desperately squeeze the labor, increasing the working hours, even exceeding ten hours or more per day, but the efficiency received is not worth the price spent on the work. In the Soviet Union, because they wanted to strive for greater efficiency, they even reduced the working hours to six hours, and his efficiency often exceeded the work.</p>
<p>We also need this, just as the ancient saying says—"doing half the work and getting twice the results." First, we should deeply understand the nature of the work, and concentrate on the work; second, there should be appropriate adjustments. Working at the desk all day will not achieve the expected results. After work, we should have entertainment and exercise. So that our work is properly adjusted, and the efficiency is improved.</p>
<h3>Miscellany: Two Million Colors</h3>
<p>— Lan Ping</p>
<p>According to the statistics of famous scientists, if a person's eyes are not colorblind or have other diseases, they can distinguish an average of two million different colors.</p>
<h3>Pulse and Life</h3>
<p>The normal pulse rate is 72 beats per minute, which is the most regular. People with this number of pulse beats usually have a longer lifespan than others. People with short lives have an average pulse rate that is about three beats per minute higher than those with long lives. This does not mean that people with fast pulse rates are necessarily short-lived, but only that the average lifespan of people with fast pulse rates is shorter. However, there are many exceptions, so people with fast pulse rates do not need to worry.</p>
<h3>Cat's Eyes</h3>
<p>Can cats see in the dark? I think many people will answer "yes." But this answer is actually wrong. Cat's eyes are just more sensitive than humans, so cats can find things in dim light while humans cannot. In absolute darkness, even cats cannot see. What we commonly think of as dark places actually have some light, so cats can see.</p>

<h3>Hawthorne Case: The Dancer's Fate</h3>
<p>— By Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter 1: "A Very Pretty Miss!"</p>
<p>He murmured: It's really strange. Brother Jin Shou, how did you think of searching for bullets?</p>
<p>Ni replied: "The people in this house said that they heard gunshots after midnight last night, which led to the discovery of this murder case. I looked at the straight line of the fatal wound and found this bullet on the wall. I just pried it out when you arrived."</p>
<p>Hawthorne said: "How many people are in this house? Have you questioned them?"</p>
<p>"I've only talked a few words roughly and haven't asked in detail yet. There are not many people in the house. There is an old man named Li Zifan, who is the deceased's uncle. A maid named Jinmei, and an old nanny and a caretaker named Lao Mao."</p>
<p>"I think it's best to talk to that uncle first—oh, wait a minute. This cigarette holder on this desk seems a little out of place." As Hawthorne spoke, he stepped forward, wrapped his fingers in a white cloth, and picked up an imitation ivory cigarette holder from the side of the desk.</p>
<p>I took the opportunity to look at the desk. The things on the desk were very simple, but they were very delicate. A gilded engraved inkwell, with two inkwells in red and blue, both lids were covered, and there were two pen tubes between the two Mengs, both empty, showing that these things were only used as decorations on the desk, and not for other purposes. A silver vase was also a genuine imported product, and there were no [unclear character] flowers in the vase. There were several books on the right hand, all of which were picture publications such as "Dance Star Little Notes" and "Movie Monthly." In the center, there was a thick glass lined with green velvet, and several photos of male and female stars were arranged under the glass. (15)</p>

<h3>The Women's Dormitory at Fudan University</h3>
<p>— Xiao</p>
<p>The Fudan Women's Association and the Fudan Drama Society performed Yu Ling's play "Women's Dormitory" at the Youth Association on the 12th. The play has already been made into a very popular film.</p>
<p>Among the actors, the grandmother who played Tian Tai Xuan's mother was the best. It is said that this old lady is already sixty-two years old, and she is still so enthusiastic. It's really not easy. The few words of Mandarin she spoke were quite good. Her movements were natural, and she didn't look like she was acting at all. At first, I thought she was the nanny of someone from the star circle, no wonder she was so experienced!</p>
<p>Pei's Mandarin is very good, and her acting skills have improved greatly. Her pronunciation is louder than before, and her makeup is also better than before. In the first act, her posture of smoking and walking is very similar to Lan Lan, perhaps she learned it by imitating. Shi Dina's Liu Lizhu was very successful when eating Zhenjiang specialty products in the second act. In this tense second act, Hao Chuan's (played by Luo Huasheng) display of power and Pei Pei's contempt were also performed very well.</p>
<p>Yi De played Zhao Songyun. Her Mandarin was slightly worse, but her dull expression and sad tone captured the audience below the stage, and immediately made the whole place quiet. I saw glittering tears rolling in Yi De's eyes. It was rare to make the fake seem real.</p>
<p>The calm Huang Huifang is an old hand. Her few words of "so-so" were particularly vivid. An Lan made her debut and played Sha Xia competently, but her Mandarin was not very good. Ling Zi's Zhao Guanying was quite sincere when she cried at the end.</p>
<p>As for the male characters, Chen Ziqiang seems to be from Fujian or Guangdong. Although he tried his best to learn Mandarin when playing Ru Shi, he still seemed to have a Fujian-Guangdong accent, but it was already not very obvious. He had several fluent passages. Chen Cang's Qi Weide was very good. Lao Zhang's Niu Dawang was a little lacking in composure when he recalled things in the second act, but he did a good job when the husband and wife reunited at the end. I saw that Luo Huasheng's face was really flushed when he showed his power, which was good in itself.</p>
<p>The lighting was sometimes completely dark due to inexperience, so it should be more accurate. The back of a chair facing the stage in the third act was very clever. Because general arrangements are designed to have the actors' faces facing the audience, so that the audience can see the actors' expressions clearly, which is good in principle. But in reality, it would never be so coincidental. Therefore, a chair facing the stage is possible in reality. At the same time, when there are too many characters, it can increase the attention of the main characters, and other actors can also get a chance to breathe and rest while sitting on the chair. The composition is also unique. Therefore, I say this method is clever.</p>
<p>Close-up of Ann Sheridan</p>
<h3>About the "Um" Girl, Ann Sheridan</h3>
<p>— Yong</p>
<p>Ann Sheridan is a well-known "Um" girl on the screen. Speaking of her acting skills, she has already left a deep impression in everyone's minds, so there is no need for the writer to introduce her again.

<p>Entertainment</p>
<p>Ann Sheridan's relaxation behind the screen, in terms of sports, is skating and swimming. In addition, she also likes to collect various flowers and fruit trees. She often uses the money she saves to buy government bonds, or she uses it to buy jewelry and other things. After buying them, she never wears them. She says, "I just like to buy them!"</p>
<p>Wishes</p>
<p>She has a wish that she hopes to realize sooner or later: the first is that she hopes that she can become a great actress like Bette Davis in the future. The second is to have a large pasture.</p>
<p>Superstition</p>
<p>It may be laughable to say, Ann Sheridan is also a person who worships superstition. If she puts a hat on the bed, or whispers in the dressing room, she believes that these two things will bring bad luck. On weekdays, she always wears an agate ring on her hand. According to her, this is a charm that represents good luck!</p>
<p>Ann Sheridan speaks Spanish fluently, which is a source of pride for her among the stars in Hollywood.</p>
<p>Marriage</p>
<p>Not long ago, there were often rumors that she was going to marry someone. On this issue, she made the following remarks. She said: "The man who is most suitable in my ideal should have an extraordinary ambition, and his personality should be somewhat humorous. It doesn't matter whether he is rich or poor, and as for his appearance, as long as he is not ugly, there is no need to be too handsome. When it comes to age, if his spirit and energy are like a twenty-one-year-old youth, then his real age can be between twenty-five and forty-five, and it doesn't matter. Finally, he must dance very well."</p>
<h3>The African Circus to Perform in Suzhou</h3>
<p>The African Circus came to Shanghai at the invitation of Shunli Company to perform. It has been more than a month now. Yesterday, the reporter met the person in charge of the circus. According to him, the African Circus may stop performing in the next few days, but before stopping, they will perform a charity show for several days. The proceeds from the sale of tickets will be given to charitable organizations to be used to help refugees. In addition, it is said that after this break, they may go to Suzhou to perform, because recently someone from Suzhou came to Shanghai to contact the African Circus. If there are no other obstacles, it can proceed. (Xinggu)</p>
